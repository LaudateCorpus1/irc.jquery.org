[00:31:33] <evilaim> I farted
[00:32:52] <tdignan> hey, jqueryui.com seems down
[00:32:58] <tdignan> does anyone know where I can get the docs
[00:33:12] <Woet> up here
[00:33:26] <Woet> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/jqueryui.com
[00:33:56] <tdignan> yeha, down for me
[00:33:57] <tdignan> in any even
[00:33:59] <tdignan> t
[00:34:11] <tdignan> good thing I just realized the UI docs are also on the main jquery site
[00:57:47] <rindolf> Hi all.
[00:58:24] <rindolf> Can anyone recommend a nice jQuery or jQueryUI plugin for folds, like in the [Hide]/[Show] button here - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ ?
[01:06:33] <tw2113> gimme a min rindolf
[01:06:45] <rindolf> tw2113: you can have two. :-)
[01:11:48] <tw2113> rindolf, see what you can do with this: http://d.pr/n/DNZ4
[01:11:54] <tw2113> most of the css can probably be ignored
[01:12:03] <tw2113> script block is what you'll want
[01:12:14] <tw2113> and you can see it in action here http://sageprojectconsultants.com/what-we-do/grants/#
[01:12:26] <tw2113> site i did a couple years back or so
[01:12:39] <rindolf> tw2113: setTimeout?
[01:12:43] <tw2113> probably late 2011
[01:12:50] <rindolf> tw2113: I already have some logic of my own.
[01:12:52] <tw2113> it worked, i wasn't going to fight it
[01:13:02] <rindolf> tw2113: I'm loooking for a plugin that I can source and use.
[01:13:21] <tw2113> why go for a bulky plugin when you can get the same functionality with this snippet?
[01:13:24] <johanhar> If I want to use .one() but then it's triggered and later on I wan't it to let it trigger, I have to .unbind() and .one() again on the given element? It's not working...
[01:13:32] <tw2113> :P
[01:16:17] <rindolf> tw2113: because I want to use it several times.
[01:16:30] <derik> what i wrong here ? http://jsfiddle.net/dKy9a/  why jquery didn`t load my json
[01:16:40] <rindolf> tw2113: on several pages and stuff.
[01:16:51] <rindolf> tw2113: it doesn't have to be very big.
[01:17:28] <tw2113> with a bit of creative thinking, i bet you could get that snippet i pasted to work multiple times
[01:17:35] <tw2113> otherwise, i don't have a plugin that i know of
[01:17:41] <tw2113> but i figured i'd contribute anyway
[01:18:55] <shoky> johanhar you don't need to .unbind() after it's triggered
[01:19:50] <johanhar> shoky: I found the coding error :) I
[01:20:33] <vague> I have a javascript function that checks all elements in a form for a 'modified' flag, if it is 1, it adds the element and value to the url. With this http://www.linpaste.org/30 scriptlet enabled the form thinks it has 0 elements. With the scriptlet disabled, the form has 16 elements. Does anybody have an idea why this would be? Could the span somehow interfer with the form?
[01:20:53] <shoky> derik:  $.parseJSON is for parsing json, not loading it
[01:20:56] <tw2113> derik, i'm getting SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[01:21:09] <derik> tw2113 mee to
[01:21:14] <johanhar> If I want to do something from an event that is triggered very often, but I only want to do it the first time the event was triggered... I bind an event from another event that is triggered many times, but I only want to bind once... Any pattern?
[01:22:05] <derik> shoky but json didn`t loaded on var jsonp = 'http://openapi.ro/api/companies/13548146.json';
[01:22:27] <tw2113> no you assigned a string to a variable
[01:22:44] <shoky> derik:  http://jsfiddle.net/dKy9a/1/
[01:24:19] <derik> thanks shoky but didn`t apear value of cif from json, apear undefined
[01:24:29] <shoky> derik: because it doesnt have a 'cif' field
[01:24:40] <shoky> o it does, wait
[01:24:55] <shoky> it's not an array
[01:25:31] <shoky> just one object: {"vat":"1","city":"SIBIU","updated_at":"2012-12-17T18:48:24+00:00","cif":"13548146","created_at":"2011-03-16T12:54:36+00:00","consecutive_update_fails":0,"address":"BLD. MIHAI VITEAZU Nr. 7,Ap. 18","name":"CUBUS ARTS S.R.L.","registration_id":"J32 /508 /2000","fax":"","authorization_number":"","phone":"0269232192","zip":"550350","state":"Sibiu"}
[01:25:50] <derik> yes
[01:26:04] <derik> and have "cif":"13548146"
[01:26:11] <shoky> derik: http://jsfiddle.net/dKy9a/2/
[01:26:32] <derik> thanks shoky
[01:27:13] <shoky> np
[01:27:24] <derik> i am to noob on jquery :D
[01:27:45] <shoky> indeed ;]
[01:28:05] <shoky> learn to read the docs very carefully
[01:28:37] <derik> yes, that i will do
[01:29:10] <derik> i see that http://learn.jquery.com is very helpful
[01:30:15] <shoky> haven't gotten myself familiar with it yet
[01:30:30] <shoky> its pretty new
[01:31:02] <thinkerweb> If I have a <span id="myspanid"></span> and I wanna fill the contents, should I use $("#myspanid").html("my dynamic content"); or is there a better way?
[01:31:37] <shoky> thinkerweb: there are other ways too.. 'better' would depend on the scenario/context
[01:32:01] <Nebros> good morning. i have there a problem with nth-child on ie9 (pls no flame about ie, i have to use it, cause my boss sayed that) this is what i have tried till now: http://jsfiddle.net/qBxWe/ can someone tell me how to fix my problem? ... and yes in minimum one try did it work on ff and chrome. but never on ie9
[01:32:04] <shoky> if you just want to set it to a string of html, .html() is great
[01:34:28] <thinkerweb> shoky, thx, I think html is fine too
[01:34:51] <seutje> Nebros: actual generated html would be nice
[01:34:58] <derik> shoky why you put ?callback=? behind .json ?
[01:36:23] <shoky> derik:  because that makes jquery turn it into a JSONP script request instead of a regular ajax request. otherwise you couldn't load it because of cross-domain issues
[01:36:31] <seutje> Nebros: also, if ur generating it like that, why don't u put a class on every nth element?
[01:37:00] <Nebros> ohh, sry thats a django part. ^^ http://jsfiddle.net/qBxWe/2/
[01:37:33] <shoky> Nebros: are you sure you're not on compatibility-mode ?
[01:37:35] <Nebros> cause i have a generated option list with more than 1k lines...
[01:37:45] <seutje> Nebros: .nth option:nth-of-type(3) won't match anything, <option> is what has the .nth type, not its parent
[01:37:48] <derik> shoky and if i call local do not have to put this
[01:37:54] <fnagel> Hey guys, is there a way to nicely sequentially animatze multipel elements?
[01:38:02] <seutje> s/type/class/
[01:38:07] <shoky> derik: ya if its on the same domain as the page is, then you dont need it probably
[01:38:19] <derik> thanks
[01:38:21] <Nebros> i copyed all 3 tryes in this fiddle
[01:38:45] <shoky> Nebros: are you sure you're not on compatibility-mode in IE?
[01:39:13] <shoky> or some other non-IE9 mode
[01:39:17] <Nebros> shoky: i cant change anithing in the mode options
[01:39:23] <shoky> press F12
[01:39:26] <seutje> top 2 should match, not sure if IE9 allows targetting/styling <option> elements though
[01:39:30] <Nebros> its based on windows
[01:39:43] <shoky> what's the Browser Mode and the Document Mode ?
[01:40:34] <Nebros> its not in kompatibility mode
[01:40:50] <shoky> and my last question?
[01:41:23] <Nebros> ie9 , ie9-standart
[01:41:37] <Nebros> shoky you are faster than me xD
[01:42:16] <shoky> well, i'm seeing the same on IE9 and chrome
[01:42:28] <Nebros> hmm mom
[01:43:02] <Nebros> i watched the komp on wrong page... my page is on that compat... mode
[01:43:15] <Nebros> how can i change it for all user of my page?
[01:44:45] <shoky> you cant always force it.. but, use html5 doctype and maybe that <meta> thing on IE-edge or IE9 or whutever
[01:45:03] <Nebros> kk
[01:45:10] <shoky> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
[01:46:24] <T-Co> Better yet make it an HTTP header: X-UA-Compatible "IE=Edge,chrome=1"
[01:50:32] <Fernando1asso> https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/4504209 <-- Even if the action is 'publish', for instance, it is running that submit. Why?
[01:52:33] <Nebros> hmm
[01:53:18] <Nebros> T-Co: how it have to look with your variant? im not the best programmer. ^^
[01:54:06] <Nebros> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible "IE=Edge,chrome=1" /> like this?
[01:54:16] <Fernando1asso> This line causes the problem: var id_arr = $("#table_list input[name='id_arr[]']:checked"); If I create an array myself like id_arr = [2, 9, 11], then that else works as expected.
[01:58:30] <T-Co> Nebros, Never mind
[01:58:59] <T-Co> If you'd have access to server a better solution would be to have it send an HTTP header with the same information
[01:59:21] <T-Co> I'm guessing that's not the case
[01:59:49] <marcogmonteiro> morning everyone...
[02:00:33] <marcogmonteiro> does anyone knows any plugin or a way to do a "effect" of a light turning on…
[02:00:39] <Nebros> T-Co: i have installed the server. apache 2.2. but i have no idea how to do this ^^
[02:00:44] <marcogmonteiro> something like those old lights flicking
[02:03:10] <T-Co> Nebros, http://pastebin.com/VTUj30rY
[02:03:48] <T-Co> marcogmonteiro, For text? CSS text-shadow. For elements? CSS box-shadow?
[02:04:43] <marcogmonteiro> the testing I'm doing is I have a switch, on / off and the idea is having a layer over the entire body that lights on or off
[02:04:48] <Nebros> T-Co: and what i have to do with this code?
[02:06:06] <Nebros> T-Co: fill into the apache conf?
[02:06:09] <T-Co> Nebros, Put it either into your VirtualHost configuration: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/examples.html or .htaccess http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/htaccess.html
[02:06:39] <T-Co> I don't want to discriminate either. I'd prefer nginx anyway :)
[02:07:04] <marcogmonteiro> T-Co the effect I'm looking for is something like http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XBkCkq-eKA second 4 to 10
[02:09:19] <darthlukan> marcogmonteiro: here's something that looks to be what you're looking for: https://github.com/nhunzaker/jquery-flicker
[02:10:23] <marcogmonteiro> darthlukan oh my! thank you so much… apparently my google foo wasn't as strong as yours =)
[02:10:44] <lundy> morning
[02:11:01] <darthlukan> "jquery lightbulb effects plugin" was my search term.  I tried "jquery light effects plugin" but didn't get anything close :P
[02:11:14] <darthlukan> for future reference, in case you lose that link
[02:11:38] <darthlukan> morning lucasw5
[02:11:38] <marcogmonteiro> darthlukan I was trying stuff around light effects and whatnot =)
[02:11:44] <darthlukan> lundy: good morning
[02:11:59] <darthlukan> marcogmonteiro: it happens :)
[02:12:09] <marcogmonteiro> anyways, thanks =)
[02:12:22] <darthlukan> no problem, glad to be of help!
[02:17:33] <Nebros> T-Co: i copied it now in the conf and it want work, and the variant with meta from shoky will not work aswell...
[02:29:26] <T-Co> marcogmonteiro, http://line25.com/articles/using-css-text-shadow-to-create-cool-text-effects
[02:30:25] <marcogmonteiro> T-Co I'll look into that in a bit.
[02:30:39] <sunuslee> hi,  i want a plugin like this: http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/6f8ab2b4gw1e20hbf8v6aj.jpg a thumbnail which can be selected, any suggestions?
[02:30:43] <SP33D> sorry that i ask this here i know it has nothing to do with jquery exactly but in the other javascript channel no one is around only 2 trolling dudes talking about what ever
[02:30:45] <SP33D> http://jsfiddle.net/8jSPL/1/
[02:30:58] <SP33D> i can't get the value of my hidden fild and i don't know why
[02:31:05] <SP33D> i use getbyid and it looks right
[02:31:12] <marcogmonteiro> but what darthlukan sent me looks more what I want...
[02:31:15] <SP33D> maybe some one hopefully finds the fail
[02:32:01] <seutje> why do ppl localize coads? :(
[02:32:08] <T-Co> marcogmonteiro, I see what you're after. Cool
[02:34:00] <rindolf> Can anyone recommend a nice jQuery or jQueryUI plugin for folds, like in the [Hide]/[Show] button here - http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/ ?
[02:34:25] <seutje> SP33D: you have duplicate IDs, chances are it's matching the wrong one, as getElementById inherently only returns 1 element
[02:35:08] <seutje> also, ur trying to call ur functions in a global scope
[02:35:18] <SP33D> ah so i am simply not allowed to use two times the same id for evel the value ok
[02:35:33] <SP33D> seutje hehehe its a offline project
[02:35:41] <SP33D> for a secured envirment :D
[02:35:51] <SP33D> this file will get used localy only
[02:36:12] <SP33D> its only to make the life easyer for my Workers that change money
[02:36:13] <seutje> that's an awesome reason to discard any standards out there!
[02:36:13] <SP33D> :D
[02:36:32] <SP33D> i am not familary with javascript standarts since i am new to that
[02:36:43] <SP33D> i only need to use it coz i can't use php localy without a server
[02:36:44] <SP33D> :(
[02:36:59] <seutje> unique IDs is regular old HTML
[02:37:01] <SP33D> Sorry for my noobnes on that but i swear i will learn the java script guidlines time after time
[02:37:13] <SP33D> i have in html only one time the id
[02:37:14] <SP33D> :D
[02:37:18] <seutje> no sorry, only happy
[02:37:28] <SP33D> i have it 2 times in javascript
[02:37:41] <SP33D> with the same id coz i tought he will take the value and then retake the same value
[02:37:54] <seutje> nah, it just find the first one and stops
[02:38:37] <seutje> CSS works different though, u can target multiple elements with the same ID, but u prolly shouldn't :P
[02:38:41] <SP33D> nice to know i need to learn more ^^ at present i am learning jquery ui coz i have some projects in mind but i need to finish this littel calc first you helped me a lot
[02:39:08] <seutje> any time
[02:39:21] <SP33D> i probally would need days till i found out such infos ^^ coz i am not working with EMCA so often
[02:39:21] <SP33D> :D
[02:51:56] <SP33D> seutje that wasn't the only fail
[02:53:22] <SP33D> the pintIt function still don't gets a value
[02:54:33] <eshlox> i have array with 7000+ elements, i need something faster than JSON.stringify(), ideas?
[02:56:01] <Cork> eshlox: if json is the bottleneck for you, you need to reduce the amount of elements
[02:56:15] <Cork> cause if you can't parse it fast enough, it will be hell using it
[02:56:21] <T-Co> eshlox, Faster processing time or smaller payload?
[02:56:27] <SP33D> http://jsfiddle.net/8jSPL/4/ can some one plz look what my fail is http://jsfiddle.net/8jSPL/4/
[02:56:51] <SP33D> i have two functions and both don't work they are quit easy and should get only one value but they don't get it
[02:59:08] <Cork> SP33D: you should ask that in #javascript not #jquery
[02:59:18] <T-Co> eshlox, Here is a good comparison: https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki
[02:59:23] <SP33D> Cork i know scroll up :D
[02:59:32] <SP33D> in javascript only one troll is alive
[02:59:38] <SP33D> :D
[02:59:40] <T-Co> eshlox, Spotify uses http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
[02:59:56] <T-Co> The reason apparently was that JSON was bloated
[03:00:06] <T-Co> Or is
[03:00:07] <Cork> SP33D: and ... thats some really horrible code
[03:00:10] <seutje> SP33D: jsfiddle wraps your code in a window load event handler, causing it to be scoped rather than in the global scope, so your inline onclick thing can't reach ur function
[03:00:30] <Cork> 1. broken html (unquoted values) 2. inline event attributes, 3. eval ...
[03:00:49] <SP33D> ah thx a lot
[03:01:01] <seutje> u don't have to quote single-word attributes
[03:01:17] <Cork> well, have to sure; but it should be
[03:01:18] <xande17> nick _17xande
[03:01:32] <seutje> true, but calling it broken is a bit harsh
[03:01:51] <seutje> I'm more annoyed with unclosed input elements :P
[03:02:06] <Cork> seutje: well if you close it it IS broken html...
[03:02:06] <SP33D> i added />
[03:02:07] <SP33D> :D
[03:02:15] <Cork> its xhtml that closes them
[03:02:27] <SP33D> it was only for testing and presenting the code :D
[03:02:28] <Cork> html error corrects it to <input >
[03:02:28] <eshlox> Cork, T-Co: firefox shows message about unresponsive script
[03:02:49] <eshlox> hm
[03:02:55] <seutje> I don't even care, I still close em
[03:03:23] <Cork> eshlox: and your sure thats from the JSON.stringify ?
[03:03:30] <Cork> not something around it?
[03:04:02] <SP33D> oh my good thx a lot
[03:04:03] <SP33D> :D
[03:04:08] <seutje> it ain't broken till it breaks <( '.'<) (^'.'^) (>'.' )>
[03:04:14] <SP33D> its working puhhh now i can start doing the app lol
[03:07:17] <eshlox> Cork: 99%, but i will check again
[03:27:37] <thinkerweb> anyone here have a mobile device -for testing
[03:28:10] <zmo> hi
[03:29:19] <thinkerweb> I tried to add page swipe feature to a mobile site, but it doesn't work for me so I am wondering if it is just my device
[03:30:04] <thinkerweb> It works on my desktop with my mouse
[03:31:10] <Cork> thinkerweb: do your desktop have a touch screen?
[03:31:22] <Cork> else your most likely using the wrong event
[03:31:25] <zmo> I'm using fancytree (basically almost same thing as dynatree jquery extension), and that extensions generates a ul/li list out of a JSON tree I'm feeding it... I then wanted to add a onmouseover event, so I've done $('.myclass').hover(function() {console.log('foo')}) but that works only for the first level <li> not for the imbricated ones
[03:32:01] <zmo> I'm going to push my code on my server later on, but has anybody an idea why it wouldn't work globally, just out of what I said?
[03:32:02] <Kambfhase> zmo: try mouseenter
[03:32:16] <zmo> Kambfhase - instead of hover ?
[03:32:36] <Kambfhase> Im not sure if hover uses enter or over.
[03:33:17] <Kambfhase> oh, its mouse enter.
[03:33:24] <thinkerweb> Cork, no
[03:33:36] <Kambfhase> Well, no idea then. :(
[03:33:36] <thinkerweb> Cork, do you have a mobile device?
[03:33:41] <Cork> ya
[03:33:55] <thinkerweb> Cork, can pm a link to you to try please?
[03:33:57] <Cork> thinkerweb: mouse enter expects that you have a mouse
[03:34:01] <Cork> so.. that won't work
[03:34:07] <Cork> you need to use touchstart/touchend
[03:34:14] <thinkerweb> Cork, ok, let me post the script then, 1 sec
[03:35:41] <Kambfhase> Can anyone just point me to the page that says: This is how you do a proper jQ Plugin?
[03:35:43] <thinkerweb> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/KAfPS/
[03:36:13] <thinkerweb> Kambfhase, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[03:37:05] <Kambfhase> ah, it in the docs, not on plugins.jquery.com. thx, @ thinkerweb
[03:37:45] <thinkerweb> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/KAfPS/1/
[03:38:43] <thinkerweb> Kambfhase, its a new site now
[03:38:56] <inad922> hello
[03:39:24] <inad922> is there a way to get a color css attribute with jquery in the hexa representation?>
[03:39:55] <inad922> I mean when I run $('html').css('background-color') I get a 'rgba(0,0,0,0)' string
[03:40:02] <Kambfhase> oh yeah, doc.jquery is the old one.
[03:40:04] <inad922> and I want #ffffff
[03:40:18] <inad922> is there a way to force this format
[03:40:19] <inad922> ?
[03:41:19] <thinkerweb> Cork, I think holding left click and dragging the is same as touch screen swipes
[03:42:19] <Cork> thinkerweb: as far as i know those arn't real events
[03:42:28] <Kambfhase> inad922: google for jquery plugin and color
[03:43:05] <thinkerweb> Cork yeah you're right, but it seems to work I think.  Try it at www.bynadeem.info/pg-swipe -drag the mouse left and right
[03:43:13] <thinkerweb> Cork, it works for me
[03:46:13] <Cork> thinkerweb: ah, thats an event generated by jquery-mobile
[03:46:25] <Cork> and ya, with mobile loaded it works
[03:46:45] <howardgrigg> Hey does anyone know of an accordion script that will let me make one that looks like this? http://cl.ly/image/1z1P0v2R432y
[03:47:04] <thinkerweb> Cork, yeah, thats what I meant, so does it work on your mobile device?  I think I have a mobile device that doesn't support it.
[03:47:28] <koichirose> Hello everyone, any hints about this? http://jsfiddle.net/dGPfQ/ - it's about cloning forms and posting data
[03:47:35] <inad922> Thanks Kambfhase
[03:47:42] <Cork> thinkerweb: well it reacts and changes if you make a touch move a few pixels
[03:47:50] <Cork> but i wouldn't really call that swipe though
[03:48:00] <Kambfhase> there is a jquery plugin for every thing. and google knows them all
[03:48:35] <Cork> Kambfhase: you REALLY should have a form around that
[03:48:42] <thinkerweb> Cork, cool
[03:49:31] <Kambfhase> Cork: i assume you meant koichirose?
[03:49:49] <Cork> Kambfhase: sorry yes
[03:50:02] <koichirose> Cork: yes, of course. that's a quick example
[03:50:05] <Cork> koichirose: also to get the structure you want you have to specify the id in the name
[03:50:16] <Cork> its a limitation in php
[03:50:22] <Cork> so you have to compensate in js
[03:51:24] <thinkerweb> Cork, if you do jquery regex form validation, would you skip php filter_vars() validation?
[03:51:32] <koichirose> Cork: what do you mean with "the id in the name" ?
[03:51:53] <zmo> is it possible to list all matches for a $(".myclass") ?
[03:52:24] <Cork> koichirose: holder[][age] needs to be holder[0][age]
[03:52:43] <Cork> when php sees [] it just does [counter++]
[03:53:02] <Cork> it doesn't know of a way to handle children
[03:53:13] <koichirose> Cork: ok, so I'd have to add an index in there with js. How? Looks it's going to be weird and unmaintanable
[03:53:26] <synapt> I don't think that's so much specifically a PHP limitation as much as spec of how HTML post's 'html arrays' so to word them
[03:53:52] <Cork> koichirose: either before you submit loop over them and do a fairly simple regex replace on the name
[03:54:38] <Cork> var counter = 0; elm.name = elm.name.replace('[]', '[' + (counter++) +']');
[03:55:13] <Cork> well that would actually do the exact same thing as php does, but you get the point
[03:55:37] <koichirose> yes, got it. I hoped there would be something better, a library that does that for me or something ^^
[03:56:01] <Cork> koichirose: you could stringify it to json, and send it that way
[03:56:32] <Cork> you would have to tinkle a little bit or how to create the objects though
[03:56:49] <Cork> but its most likely the nicer solution in the ned
[03:56:51] <Cork> *end
[04:00:05] <koichirose> hmm…I'll try something, thank you!
[04:01:48] <Nachtwind> hi. i am using the toast plugin (https://github.com/akquinet/jquery-toastmessage-plugin/wiki) and want to use it in a callback of another plugin (raty). So.. if i just add <script>$.toast...</script> it works. But in the callback i receive an error that the object wouldnt exist. does anyone have an idea why?
[04:12:45] <jkarsrud> I think jquery.com is a bit sick; http://hsmaker.com/harlemshake.asp?url=http://jquery.com
[04:13:38] <delboy1978uk> lol
[04:15:09] <delboy1978uk> funnier with microsoft.com lol
[04:20:32] <johanhar> if I bind an event with jQuery, the event given to the handler, will .target always work? I see some forums and sites on the web talking about the event.target not working in all browsers, I think IE need srcElement or something... but will jQuery take care of this?
[04:21:19] <johanhar> nvm
[04:36:36] <kristofers> I have multiple anchor tag that when clicked it adds a new row in my table
[04:36:46] <kristofers> But it's only working on the first
[04:36:48] <kristofers> not the others
[04:37:00] <Kambfhase> ?p @ kristofers
[04:37:31] <Kambfhase> kristofers: please paste your code to http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:05:39] <fabioportieri> hi
[05:06:32] <fabioportieri> can someone pls explain me why $.browser is no more? it was so handy...
[05:07:20] <Kambfhase> why would you want to use $.browser?
[05:09:17] <fabioportieri> because it's handy?
[05:09:51] <fabioportieri> since different browser sometimes react to code in different way...
[05:11:07] <yogurt_truck> not very good reasons, those, fabioportieri
[05:11:25] <fabioportieri> why not?
[05:11:40] <yogurt_truck> fabioportieri: condition your code based on actualy feature support, not on browser version/agent/etc
[05:12:20] <fabioportieri> yeah but this approach require more work
[05:12:44] <fabioportieri> i don't get why using browser detection is bad practice in the first place
[05:12:46] <carpii> good software is always more work than shitty s/w :)
[05:13:10] <yogurt_truck> fabioportieri: i just told you why
[05:13:15] <fabioportieri> ehe sometimes the easiest solution is the best
[05:13:30] <fabioportieri> yogurt_truck: when?
[05:14:47] <yogurt_truck> fabioportieri: you don't get why "if websocketsAreSupported doThis" is a better practice than "if userAgent == 'IE 10' or 'Mozilla Something'"?
[05:15:28] <fabioportieri> yes
[05:15:59] <yogurt_truck> yes you do or yes you don't?
[05:16:13] <fabioportieri> yes i don't get it
[05:16:29] <bluescreenX> Hello, how can i in jquery mobile disable this hiding behavior of a navbar with data-position fixed?
[05:17:05] <bluescreenX> when i click on the content the navbar disappears
[05:17:07] <Teduardo> I have a quick question; I have this code that loads something via ajax when a <tr> is clicked http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/ I want to make it so that on document ready I can specify which item should be clicked by default, can someone assist me?
[05:17:40] <Teduardo> more specifically, i want to specify which <tr> id should be clicked by default
[05:18:25] <yogurt_truck> fabioportieri: seriously? you don't see how going by browser versions instead of actual feature support makes your code more vulnerable, easier to break?
[05:18:35] <carpii> ted: what you mean 'clicked' by default?
[05:18:36] <dblosevn> i love it, yes i dont get it thats a new one for fml lol
[05:19:05] <carpii> and youre beter off using .addClass and putting your styles in css, rather than using .css({
[05:20:52] <fabioportieri> yogurt_truck: now that you mention it i see what you mean
[05:21:21] <Teduardo> carpii: okay, so when the page loads up right now nothing is clicked so the bottom half of the page is blank; I just want to make it so that one of the options is clicked on ready so that the whole page always shows.
[05:21:54] <carpii> what do you mean by clicked?  are you just talking about its visiual appearance?
[05:22:01] <bluescreenX> is there any documentation on the persistent navbar behavior?
[05:22:54] <Teduardo> carpii: clicked in this instance means "applying the code in the jsfiddle to the default row id"
[05:23:08] <Teduardo> carpii: you see how right now it's getting the row id from closest?
[05:23:38] <Teduardo> carpii: i just want to tell it on load apply that stuff to a specific row id until they click on something
[05:23:40] <carpii> extract it out into a function, so that you pass the id in
[05:23:58] <carpii> then for your current code, you would pass in $(this).closest('tr').attr('id')
[05:24:20] <carpii> then when your document first loads, you can call the same function, but this time pass in 'tr:first').attr('id') instead
[05:24:26] <carpii> or whatever
[05:24:35] <Teduardo> ah, I was hoping there was just a way I could pass row_id into it and just have it apply
[05:24:43] <carpii> there is, like i just said
[05:24:55] <carpii> but at the moment your code is all in an event handler, so it cant be called manually
[05:35:56] <Engin> HTML5 client-side image resizing compatable with which browsers ?
[05:36:03] <Engin> from what I've read moz-only.
[05:36:15] <Engin> and I don't want to use Flash for obivous reasons.
[05:38:01] <SP33D> n browser is able to do that
[05:38:06] <SP33D> no browser or all
[05:38:17] <SP33D> are able to do that its quit simply you need to download the original data
[05:38:21] <carpii> i dont think thats true
[05:38:47] <SP33D> and if you wanna show it small play with width and height attrib of the img
[05:38:52] <SP33D> but that don't saves bandwidth
[05:39:15] <carpii> https://github.com/josefrichter/resize
[05:40:15] <Engin> let me be clearer
[05:40:24] <Engin> i want to do client-side resize before uploading a picture
[05:41:20] <carpii> Engin, I think its supported by all latest majot browsers
[05:41:30] <Engin> this is an indication that it is not supported in safari http://www.plupload.com/
[05:41:45] <Kambfhase> turning som code into a jQuery plugin. Is that jQuerification or jQueryfication?
[05:42:07] <Engin> carpii: in essense this already explains everything in great detail -> http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/how-to-develop-a-html5-image-uploader/
[05:42:11] <Engin> but looks like a mozilla only thing
[05:43:57] <carpii> Engin, that plugin upload page says Safari/Opera doesnt allow direct data access to the selected files.
[05:44:05] <carpii> Yet the articke here claims to support them all -- http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/
[05:44:30] <carpii> easiest way is just to test and see what happens :p
[05:44:37] <Engin> that is DND
[05:44:44] <Engin> i made dnd work in everybrowser, yes
[05:45:08] <Engin> yeah, i think i have to try :D
[05:45:24] <Engin> main usage of my app is safari on mac and ipad
[05:45:32] <Engin> so i have to focus on them actually
[05:55:39] <Nachtwind> hi. i am using the toast plugin (https://github.com/akquinet/jquery-toastmessage-plugin/wiki) and want to use it in a callback of another plugin (raty). So.. if i just add <script>$.toast...</script> it works. But in the callback i receive an error that the object wouldnt exist. does anyone have an idea why?
[05:57:51] <Nachtwind> the code to my problem: http://pastie.org/private/sqxzqxlup2dujhcq6gkujw
[06:00:14] <seutje> wtf, why isn't that toast thing a static method? you actually *have* to call it on an empty jQuery collection? o.O
[06:01:21] <Nachtwind> seutje:  no idea. I have virtually no experience with javascript or jquery. just following the toasty website on this
[06:01:56] <Nachtwind> cant i create an object like toasty toast = new toasty() and call that later?
[06:03:25] <discorpia> Nachtwind: javascript is not truly oop, but you can use that syntax on functions, and define local functions in it as method, then instanstiate it using new
[06:03:41] <seutje> Nachtwind: nope, it's not defined to allow that
[06:03:46] <seutje> frankly, it prolly should be
[06:03:59] <seutje> this thing redefined a bunch of anonymous functions on each call
[06:04:02] <seutje> redefines*
[06:04:02] <Nachtwind> hm, so no chance to make that thing work within that callback? 0o
[06:04:19] <seutje> I don't even get why it doesn't work
[06:04:35] <Nachtwind> oh
[06:04:50] <chriisi> hi theere
[06:06:09] <discorpia> it looks very easy to write though
[06:06:48] <Kambfhase> discorpia: In JS you can create an object just by {}. Why do you call JS `not oop`?
[06:07:09] <Nachtwind> discorpia:  i wouldnt even know where to start
[06:07:17] <Nachtwind> javascript is quite esoteric for me still
[06:07:20] <discorpia> Nachtwind: can you show a snippet of the version that doesn't work? from your description it should work to send it as a callback
[06:07:39] <bluescreenX> sorry to ask again. i was wondering if i can disable the hiding behavior of a jqm fixed navbar
[06:07:53] <Nachtwind> http://pastie.org/private/sqxzqxlup2dujhcq6gkujw     thats basically the full code of it
[06:08:05] <Nachtwind> ofc there is then the div for raty and the html header etc
[06:08:06] <chriisi> a question: i got a $.get() requesting images from a php-script. as soon all images have been loaded i want to fade them in, but if i put the fade in into $.get(function()), it won't wait till the images are downloaded.. how can i solve that?
[06:08:54] <Nachtwind> oh neverminmd the \"\" stuff.. forgot to remove it - the actual code is inside php
[06:09:14] <seutje> ?deferred @ chriisi
[06:09:19] <discorpia> Kambfhase: the inheritance is a really ugly quickfix, but if that lives up to your definition of oop then by all means it is
[06:09:21] <seutje> damn bot
[06:09:40] <chriisi> bot?
[06:09:42] <seutje> chriisi: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[06:09:47] <chriisi> ahh thx!
[06:09:56] <seutje> chriisi: afaik all ajax methods return a deferred object
[06:10:11] <seutje> so u can put em all together and .done() em
[06:10:47] <chriisi> alright! great, thx a lot i'll try it out right now..
[06:11:11] <Kambfhase> discorpia: I agree, JS could use something like interfaces or promises, but classesare bullshit.
[06:11:35] <discorpia> Nachtwind: hmm, i must say that looks like how i would have done. what if you do console.log($.fn) in the callback, is it included in the list outputed in the console?
[06:12:06] <Nachtwind> give me a second
[06:12:16] <discorpia> Kambfhase: when i code javascript i usually just use objects as function namespaces and leave it at that, can't really say i miss "proper oop" in javascript
[06:12:45] <Nachtwind> discorpia:  nothing in the log
[06:13:15] <Nachtwind> the callback works though - using alert('') i get data
[06:13:25] <discorpia> Nachtwind: and when you say log you're talking about the javascript console in the browser yes?
[06:13:28] <Nachtwind> or rather testing with alert more than using it
[06:13:33] <Kambfhase> but yeah, in JS you rarely need the Javaish-enterprise-overengineered-inheritance
[06:13:43] <Nachtwind> the same log that shows me javascript errors i suppose?
[06:13:50] <discorpia> yup
[06:14:11] <discorpia> Nachtwind: that's strange, what happens if you do console.log(jQuery);?
[06:14:17] <seutje> sometimes u really want an isolated instance of a piece of functionality though
[06:15:09] <seutje> for instance, multiple autocomplete fields on a single page that have separate urls to get data and maintain a separate client-side cache
[06:15:18] <Nachtwind> discorpia:  nothing
[06:15:47] <Nachtwind> wait..
[06:15:56] <Nachtwind> that log command doesnt echo anything at all
[06:16:04] <seutje> chriisi: think this is an exact example of what ur looking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3709597/wait-until-all-jquery-ajax-request-are-done
[06:16:09] <discorpia> Nachtwind: oh, console.log() doesn't output anything? what browser?
[06:16:29] <Nachtwind> Chromium
[06:16:35] <Nachtwind> using firedebug-lite
[06:16:54] <discorpia> hmm, firebug-lite should support console.log though
[06:17:07] <jeffsmykil> pretty sure chromium does too
[06:17:14] <discorpia> but ok, put all of it in the jquery .ready()
[06:17:48] <Nachtwind> umm.. that means?
[06:17:55] <Nachtwind> first time i use jquery altogether, sorry
[06:18:36] <discorpia> Nachtwind: http://pastebin.com/iRZxYeGe
[06:18:38] <discorpia> Nachtwind: try that
[06:18:44] <seutje> looks like this guy got sick of toasty and forked it: https://github.com/paulmillr/chieftain/blob/3f7debd667939bae9e95d6975c41ae6904292773/media/tire/js/tire.js#L228
[06:18:46] <discorpia> uh sorry
[06:18:48] <discorpia> w8
[06:18:49] <seutje> looks a lot better imo
[06:19:40] <Nachtwind> discorpia:  i think that worked
[06:20:05] <Nachtwind> it actually worked!
[06:20:11] <Nachtwind> wow, thanks a million
[06:20:17] <discorpia> Nachtwind: http://pastebin.com/25Rs89Pq   is the even more proper way actually
[06:21:02] <chriisi> seutje: thx for the link
[06:21:03] <Nachtwind> out of curiousity.. does that function wait for the browser to fully load the page and then allow access to the objects there?
[06:21:20] <discorpia> Nachtwind: cool. that put everything inside the same scope with jQuery defined as $ for consistency, my second paste uses the .ready() function, which is a function that waits for the browser to be done before running any js
[06:21:38] <Nachtwind> ok, that explains it
[06:21:39] <Nachtwind> thanks
[06:22:07] <discorpia> but just to be clear; the first one only wrapped them in the same scope, only the second one used .ready() =)
[06:22:16] <Nachtwind> ok
[06:22:27] <discorpia> Nachtwind: http://api.jquery.com/ready/ if you want to read more about it
[06:22:44] <Nachtwind> i think i will
[06:22:49] <Nachtwind> but how did you change the scope?
[06:22:53] <Nachtwind> by declaring it all a function?
[06:24:55] <seutje> Nachtwind: yeah, sometimes referred to as an IIFE -> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[06:25:37] <Nachtwind> thanks will read into that
[06:25:42] <discorpia> Nachtwind: yes, by declaring it inside a[n anonymous] function, the function has it's own scope
[06:25:46] <discorpia> yeah that's a great link
[06:25:49] <Nachtwind> i sense the same problem coming up later in the code again
[06:26:15] <discorpia> Nachtwind: it's quite common to bundle jquerystuff together like that
[06:26:20] <Nachtwind> you were really a big help, thanks a lot
[06:26:24] <seutje> yeah, scope is a big think 'round these parts :P
[06:26:32] <discorpia> nyw =)
[06:26:33] <seutje> thing*
[06:27:21] <greek> hey fellas, any reason why my delegated binding on a form submit event isn't working? $("div#dialog").on("submit", "form.capture_new_patient", function() { alert("boom"); }); does nothing when I click on the submit button in that form (it's an <input type='submit' ... /> button)
[06:28:36] <discorpia> greek: a div doesn't have a submit event
[06:28:43] <discorpia> greek: you want to attach to the form element
[06:29:48] <greek> discorpia, it's a delegated binding on the form
[06:29:58] <greek> unless I'm misunderstanding you?
[06:32:39] <discorpia> greek: i think i read it wrong, sorry. are those forms created live?
[06:32:42] <jeffsmykil> I am trying to make a fiddle demonstrating my question, but I can't get the fiddle to work lol, it can't find my plugin.
[06:32:43] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/6z6Sn/1/
[06:33:20] <greek> discorpia, ok I solved it, I had to set the "name" attributes of all my inputs (the problem wasn't the event, it was the serialisation of the form). Sorry for wasting your time
[06:33:52] <discorpia> greek: oh, cool. sorry for causing confusion :D
[06:34:41] <greek> :)
[06:35:35] <Ivo> Can anyone tell me why my button text won't change here? http://jsfiddle.net/dqxkX/
[06:39:24] <seutje> Ivo: did you mean me.innerText?
[06:39:53] <Ivo> seutje: yeah I've realised I should be using a function. What's difference between .text() and .innertext()?
[06:40:01] <seutje> oh wait, these are jQuery collections
[06:40:16] <pachet> ?.text()
[06:40:18] <pachet> ?.html()
[06:40:19] <seutje> Ivo: you did me.text = foo; u need me.text(foo)
[06:40:28] <seutje> it's a method, not a property
[06:40:47] <pachet> technically a property that is a method ;]
[06:40:50] <seutje> if it were a regular html element, it was a property, but then it'd be innerText, not text
[06:42:32] <seutje> looks like ur texts are the other way around btw
[06:42:50] <seutje> hide shows it and show hides it :P http://jsfiddle.net/dqxkX/3/
[06:43:43] <seutje> and spamclicking it breaks it, so prolly need a stop() in there somewhere
[06:44:48] <jeffsmykil> Any help getting that fiddle to work, so I can ask my actual question?
[06:45:00] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/6z6Sn/1/
[06:45:17] <pachet> jsfiddle is being so slow
[06:45:44] <Ivo> seutje: yeah I came to basically that solution... I'm wondering why it's not updating after the first time you click it?
[06:46:18] <jeffsmykil> packet it seems like it always is
[06:46:28] <pachet> who's packet
[06:46:34] <jeffsmykil> a typo
[06:46:39] <seutje> lol
[06:46:42] <pachet> oh i think i've met him
[06:46:42] <jeffsmykil> he's mean
[06:46:45] <jeffsmykil> unlike you
[06:46:50] <seutje> YOU'RE A TYPO!
[06:46:59] <seutje> I kid, pliz no hurt <3
[06:47:45] <seutje> Ivo: it is updating, just to the opposite it should be
[06:47:53] <pachet> Ivo: for your consideration: http://jsfiddle.net/rV77E/
[06:48:16] <pachet> store the results of $()!
[06:48:22] <pachet> you were halfway there with var me = $(this)
[06:49:04] <seutje> also, ur $.fn.whatever should prolly return this
[06:49:26] <seutje> and should prolly run on a per-element basis so u can run it on an entire collection
[06:50:11] <seutje> and isn't "this" within an .fn function already a jQuery collection? as in, no need to wrap it in $()
[06:51:10] <pachet> unless someone does $.fn.foo.call(document.getElementById('bar'), options)
[06:51:52] <pachet> jeffsmykil: http://jsfiddle.net/meCMe/
[06:52:00] <pachet> you had the jsfiddle script running 'onload'
[06:52:30] <pachet> meaning that the first fn you were passing directly into $() was running before the IIFE below it, where .patientFlowMap was defined
[06:53:26] <darkfrog> can local storage be used cross-domain?
[06:53:39] <seutje> heh, guess u could cater for broken code
[06:57:48] <Forbidd3n> Why doesn't this trigger when I select a different radio button option?
[06:57:56] <Forbidd3n> $('input[name=Account\\[rate_class_id\\]]').on('change',function(){ console.log('Test'); });
[06:58:18] <Forbidd3n> the name of the radio button group is Account[rate_class_id] and it is correct
[06:58:22] <darkfrog> anyone here do subdomain cookies?  I've got a site that I need to do this with and it works on every browser except Firefox but I can't find any documentation that explicitly says it doesn't work.
[06:59:29] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: How about $('input[name="Account[rate_class_id]"]') ?
[07:00:58] <Forbidd3n> get an error on the unrecognized expression
[07:01:01] <Forbidd3n> I have to escape the []
[07:01:27] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, how about just adding a class to it from the server so that you don't have to use such a slow performing selectory
[07:01:28] <Forbidd3n> it isn't recognizing the .on('change',...
[07:01:53] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: I have tried that as well- setting class="rateCode" for each radio option
[07:02:13] <Forbidd3n> I am using .on since it is being added to the dom via ajax html table list
[07:02:15] <Dirkos> Is there a correct way to use e.which to get the actual key string?
[07:03:00] <pachet> Dirkos: you mean 65 > A, etf?
[07:03:04] <pachet> s/etf/etc
[07:03:06] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, in that case you need to do $('radoicontainer').on('change', 'selector', fun
[07:03:30] <Dirkos> pachet: yes, like a - will never be return while using String.fromCharcode()
[07:03:36] <Marius80> hi
[07:03:43] <Teduardo> carpii: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/
[07:04:11] <Teduardo> carpii: sorry i meant http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/1/
[07:04:21] <pachet> Dirkos: yeah, there's no good way to do it based soley on keypress
[07:04:35] <Dirkos> shit, then i need to redo my code
[07:04:37] <Dirkos> thnx for info
[07:04:43] <Marius80> I need to add an anchor <a> tag to an image.   I cannot access the HTML code for some reason,  but I got the option to run  JS Code.    Jquery runs on the site.    The part of the HTML-Code  looks like this:
[07:04:44] <Marius80> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=AWuxqZTk
[07:05:00] <Forbidd3n> thanks djQuery it works
[07:05:24] <Marius80> what I tried is this:
[07:05:25] <Marius80> $('#foo.second').replaceWith('<a href="#" target="_blank"><img src="a.jpg"/></a>');
[07:05:32] <carpii> yes Teduardo, but instead of hardcoding 45000, youd probably want to look it up dynamically via jQuery
[07:05:37] <jeffsmykil> packet thank you was helping another engineer debug a problem here
[07:05:44] <jeffsmykil> *pachet
[07:05:56] <carpii> also im not sure your ajax request should be inside click_row
[07:06:02] <carpii> but moved back into the click handler
[07:06:19] <carpii> but i might be wrong, depends on your eneds
[07:06:52] <Teduardo> carpii: it needs to run both at doc ready and when they click
[07:06:57] <carpii> oki
[07:07:08] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: http://jsbin.com/ixunef/1/edit
[07:07:30] <BillCriswell> You don't have to escape if it's quoted.
[07:08:29] <Teduardo> carpii: the only thing that should change is what it shows; if it is on ready then it will just show whatever id i tell it to; if it's a click it should show what they click
[07:08:47] <djQuery> Teduardo, why are you setting the individual td css instead of just the row css?
[07:09:10] <djQuery> Teduardo, in that case why aren't you just applying a css class to the row?
[07:11:14] <Teduardo> djQuery: I don't handle the css; im not sure why she did it like that
[07:11:57] <djQuery> Teduardo, cool, if there are lots of collumns there I see several performance issues
[07:12:18] <Teduardo> can you make some suggestions as to how it could be improved?
[07:13:01] <djQuery> Teduardo, instead of making 2 seperate .css calls to apply 2 seperate css properties  do this $('tr td').css({ 'background-color' : '', 'color' : '#333333'});
[07:13:05] <gp> Does the jqm pageinit event provide a reference to the page?  I tried $pc.appendTo($('[data-role="content"]', $.mobile.activePage)); and it appears to be adding the content to the previous page before showing the new page
[07:13:24] <Marius80> Sorry, could anyone please look at my "replace" question above?
[07:13:52] <carpii> Ted, i already suggested this before. use .addClass and .removeClass rather than .css(
[07:15:14] <jpcamara> Marius80 your paste bin example doesn't have .second in it
[07:15:16] <Teduardo> carpii: can you show me an example of how that would be achieved? or should i just google addclass removeclass
[07:15:37] <Marius80> jpcamara, .second should mean "second element"
[07:15:51] <carpii> always google ;) youll learn more
[07:15:59] <Marius80> jpcamara, like they showed it here:
[07:15:59] <Marius80> http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[07:16:30] <Brixius> Question, What does return !$('selector') do, in paticular, in the following line, $('#add').click(function() { return !$('#select1 option:selected').remove().appendTo('#select2'); });
[07:16:33] <gp> Is this the right channel for jquery mobile?
[07:17:10] <djQuery> Teduardo, carpii, http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/6/
[07:17:17] <jpcamara> Marius80 then you'd want the selector :eq(1), which will get the second element
[07:17:45] <Marius80> jpcamara, #foo:eq(1)  ?
[07:18:10] <jpcamara> Marius80 i guess what's unclear is, is there a particular part you want to replace? the whole thing? or just one of the images?
[07:18:47] <Marius80> jpcamara, every of the images needs a different link
[07:19:41] <jpcamara> Marius80 so you're trying to take the imgs and make them into imgs wrapped in <a> tags?
[07:19:50] <BillCriswell> Brixius: I don't think that would return anything besides false.
[07:19:58] <Marius80> jpcamara, YES :)))
[07:20:22] <djQuery> ?wrap@marius
[07:20:58] <Brixius> ok, found it on a blog post, and was wondering, kindof new to jquery.
[07:20:59] <djQuery> Marius80, http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[07:21:35] <jpcamara> yep
[07:21:41] <Marius80> thats cooool :)
[07:21:45] <Marius80> thank you very, very much!!
[07:21:57] <Teduardo> djQuery: so like a full example would be: http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/7/
[07:22:28] <Ivo> I don't think my selection is doing the right thing here, could anyone lend some eyes?
[07:22:33] <Ivo> http://plnkr.co/edit/nAhFcwaKoa6WiIAvdqja?p=preview
[07:22:45] <jpcamara> you'll probably want the function version, if you need to customize the links - $('.inner').wrap(function() {
[07:22:45] <jpcamara>   return '<div class="' + $(this).text() + '" />';
[07:22:46] <jpcamara> });
[07:22:54] <Makla> Hi, I am looking for some help, before I post on forum. I think that UI dialog is not working in IE9. Test link (http://test.svetiduh.si/testie.html) and image what is wrong (beside flashing when moving dialog) (http://test.svetiduh.si/error.png). Can someone please take a quick look.
[07:23:13] <djQuery> Teduardo, taking forever to load
[07:23:20] <Ivo> My aim is to only hide code under 'Solution' sections
[07:24:36] <jpcamara> gp yes it is
[07:26:18] <carpii> can anyone suggest why this sint working? im inserting a script fragment into the dom, and it works for event binding, but not when done via delegation .. http://jsfiddle.net/Tyq6k/
[07:27:09] <seutje> carpii: ur syntax for .on() is wrong
[07:27:28] <carpii> doh
[07:27:29] <carpii> thanks
[07:27:35] <seutje> it's .on('click', '#menulink_kick div.menuitem', fn)
[07:27:50] <carpii> got it, thankyou.   Im coming from jquery 1.4.x background :)
[07:28:05] <BillCriswell> Ivo: Put a class of "solution" on solution sections and just do $('.solution .highlight').hide()
[07:28:12] <seutje> if only u could trigger the '#menulink_kick' event on the <click> element :P
[07:28:58] <tomo`> Question regarding JQM 1.3.0. When I write inline script to html, the pageinit being called twice. Is there any way to fix it?
[07:29:24] <jpcamara> tomo` and this didn't happen to you in 1.2?
[07:29:44] <tomo`> jpcamara: correct.
[07:30:21] <Teduardo> djQuery: I think this one is the http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/8/ actual correct example; but i dont know why the coloring doesnt work on jsfiddle
[07:30:21] <djQuery> Teduardo, dang jsfiddle is being slow today
[07:30:47] <djQuery> Teduardo, http://jsfiddle.net/7fuk4/9/
[07:31:02] <djQuery> Teduardo, haven't looked at 8 yet
[07:31:13] <Teduardo> wow can I just give jsfiddle a new server
[07:31:14] <Teduardo> or what
[07:31:19] <Teduardo> who runs that?
[07:31:55] <djQuery> Teduardo, jsbin.com runs a lot faster but some don't like how it automaticaly saves thier work
[07:32:14] <jpcamara> tomo` weird. have an example?
[07:32:51] <Engin> yeah, it indeed looks like you can't access the contents of the file selected in <input type=file> in Safari
[07:33:01] <Teduardo> djQuery: do I need to have an empty class="" on the <tr>s?
[07:33:02] <Engin> anyone confirms or objects ?
[07:33:14] <BillCriswell> Teduardo: He just moved it recently from what I understand. No idea why it gets so slow sometimes.
[07:33:20] <Teduardo> sorry, i meant the <td>s
[07:33:25] <djQuery> Teduardo, no you don't have to they can still have other classes
[07:33:50] <djQuery> Teduardo, addClass and removeClass won't mess with them
[07:33:52] <sunbeam> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1" />
[07:33:58] <sunbeam> is this necessary in case you want to make css responsive?
[07:34:00] <sunbeam> and do i do this right here?
[07:34:15] <Teduardo> djQuery: no, I mean if there is currently no class set like in the 8 example
[07:34:33] <djQuery> Teduardo, it won't matter
[07:34:58] <Teduardo> djQuery: hmm, the 8 example doesn't seem to do the highlighting of the row; is that because the ajax isn't working?
[07:35:33] <djQuery> Teduardo, getting a lot of errors in console due to the slowness of jsfiddle on my side
[07:35:39] <djQuery> think its because of that
[07:37:00] <sunbeam> and is there a way to detect when the user makes a gesture with his device and switches from landscape to portrait?
[07:37:16] <lz> the new jquery mobile docs suck
[07:42:38] <Teduardo> djquery: ah; it doesnt look like the coloring works on my actual application either but that could be a lot of things i guess
[07:43:14] <djQuery> Teduardo, console.log all your selectors to make sure it is slecting them correctly
[07:43:43] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: orientationchange event
[07:44:23] <Teduardo> also i dont really know much about css so i just put the new css in a style tag in the header but there is already an included stylesheet so that could be messing it up too
[07:45:04] <Ivo> when is sphinx planning to have a new release?
[07:45:14] <Ivo> sorry wrong channel
[07:45:37] <chriisi> sry to bother again.. but is there a good reason why $("#gallery div").show(); doesnt work on IE9
[07:45:42] <agu10^> What do you think of this design? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/9535762/web%20design/potentialstudio.com%20new/index.html
[07:46:22] <chriisi> looks good to me i dont like the font though
[07:50:37] <djQuery> Teduardo, or it could just be that I am bad at css http://jsbin.com/oyevaj/2/edit
[07:50:46] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: do a lot people use this?
[07:50:55] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: i mean do a lot sites use this?
[07:51:19] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: $(window).bind('orientationchange', function() { } like this?
[07:52:49] <NoiseEee> $(window).on('orientationchange',function() { alert('changed!') });
[07:52:51] <sunbeam> I have a site with CSS stylesheet ready, its currently for 980px (container centered, works fine now on landscape mode) and more, but I would like to have also styles for less than 980px (portrait)
[07:53:15] <NoiseEee> don't use .bind() any more
[07:53:37] <tapius> im looking for assistance to get my close buttons to look like they used to
[07:53:38] <tapius> im comparing the 1.8.24 and the 1.10.0 custom css files and the ui-icon-close positions seems to be the same, but the main difference im noticing is that that the element calling those ui-dialog-titlebar-close classes are different, the new one is a anchor element, and the old one a button element with span
[07:53:50] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok
[07:54:16] <tapius> they're using the same image files
[07:54:23] <tapius> and the same positioning, it seems...
[07:54:40] <sunbeam> $(window).on('orientationchange',function() {  alert('changed!') }); doesn't work on ipad (at least not in xcode ipad simulator which is the same)
[07:54:41] <tapius> but the buttons are behaving differently, like the default state looks highlighted
[07:54:55] <tapius> in 1.10
[07:54:58] <raj> I'm sending ajax with data that is JSON.stringify({'key1':'item1','key2':'item2'}), but server-side, it comes out looking like {'{'key1':'item1', 'key2':'item2'}':''}
[07:55:44] <jeffsmykil> packet you still there?
[07:55:55] <discorpia> sunbeam: i think sometimes you have to fallback on resize event
[07:57:03] <sunbeam> discorpia: thanks that works
[07:57:17] <jeffsmykil> I was wondering how i could make this plugin accept the options when the sample method is called
[07:57:22] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/meCMe/10/
[07:58:25] <scott_gonzalez> tapius: Yes, the close button is an actual button widget now.
[07:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> tapius: Which means it has ui-state-default.
[07:58:48] <tapius> how do i get the image/behavior back
[07:58:49] <tapius> ?
[07:59:01] <tapius> what changes can i make to my css
[08:01:14] <scottc5> I have a question about the jquery-ui dialog. I am loading in some html, and it seems like for every href in the returned html it triggers another overlay, so 1 dialog that contains 5 links gives me 6 overlays. I can't figure out why it would do that?
[08:01:29] <scottc5> the html is returned via a $.ajax
[08:05:09] <tapius> can someone assist me in stylizing the jQueryUI 1.10 modal close button to look like the previous close buttons?
[08:09:52] <djQuery> tapius, I think it is fixed in the newest release canidate
[08:09:59] <djQuery> tapius, so compare that
[08:10:14] <djQuery> or go look at the pull requests
[08:10:39] <Forbidd3n> anyone have a good example on how to add and remove fields to validator?
[08:11:06] <jeffsmykil> Forbidd3n: I'm not sure i understand the question
[08:12:52] <Teduardo> djQuery: dang making the damn row color change is killing me lol
[08:13:44] <Teduardo> the selector must be wrong; havent been able to figure out what it's getting applied to
[08:13:51] <Forbidd3n> jeffsmykil: If a field is added to the dom, I need to add a required rule to it, and if it is removed from the dom I need to remove the rule
[08:14:05] <djQuery> Teduardo, worked in this jsbin http://jsbin.com/oyevaj/2/edit
[08:14:44] <banisterfiend> hi
[08:15:26] <banisterfiend> im using ajax to dynamically update a div with html content i get from teh server, the div resizes according to the size of the content i fetch, how do i apply a nice animation that makes the div transition in a cool way to the new size?
[08:15:41] <banisterfiend> like you see it resizing itself over say 1/10th of a second
[08:15:46] <jeffsmykil> i would add and remove a data-required attar Forbidd3n
[08:17:39] <Forbidd3n> just add data-required attribute to the field is all?
[08:17:47] <Forbidd3n> what about the error message
[08:18:31] <raj> I'm sending ajax with the 'data' setting as `JSON.stringify({'key1':'item1','key2':'item2'})`, but server-side, it comes out as `{'{'key1':'item1', 'key2':'item2'}':''}`
[08:18:33] <jeffsmykil> hide and show it based on the data-required attribute
[08:21:23] <Forbidd3n> jeffsmykil: would you mind a simple example on jsfiddle, please?
[08:21:53] <jeffsmykil> are you hiding and showing fields or removing them?
[08:23:04] <Forbidd3n> if the use selects other from dropdown then I show text field for other to be specified
[08:23:08] <Forbidd3n> I need this required
[08:23:13] <Forbidd3n> so I am doing hide/show
[08:23:17] <Forbidd3n> not add/remove
[08:23:48] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, validator takes hidden fields into cosnideration when doing the validation
[08:24:59] <djQuery> ie does not apply validation to them when hidden
[08:26:16] <jeffsmykil> thank you djQuery
[08:26:42] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, find it?
[08:26:56] <Forbidd3n> I found this and it works - http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/rules
[08:27:12] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: I meant thank you for helping him
[08:27:17] <jeffsmykil> I'm still working on my problem
[08:28:35] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/17/edit
[08:28:40] <djQuery> that help?
[08:28:49] <Teduardo> djQuery: hm, the class="selected" seems to be moving each time I click on an option in the list but the styling doesnt change.. its doing this <tr id="103094" class="selected">
[08:28:55] <jeffsmykil> for the person whims problem that was probably ;)
[08:29:23] <banisterfiend> im using ajax to dynamically update a div with html content i get from teh server, the div resizes according to the size of the content i fetch, how do i apply a smooth transition animation from the old size to the new size?
[08:29:35] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/meCMe/10/ I'm wondering how i get those options to take when it is called on the settimeout
[08:29:37] <jeffsmykil> http://jsfiddle.net/meCMe/10/
[08:29:57] <jeffsmykil> banisterfiend: if you are using jqueryui you can use animate()
[08:30:24] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: how exactly? inside my ajax call i simply have this code: $('#info').html(data)
[08:30:48] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: where would i go from there to animating a smooth transition from the current size to the new size (which will be determined by 'data') ?
[08:30:50] <jeffsmykil> would be tough without knowing the new height of the div
[08:31:35] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, does this plugin require jqueryui?
[08:31:37] <jeffsmykil> maybe you could set the animate to auto?
[08:31:47] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: no but the animate function does
[08:32:10] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: this is just a test case I'm not actually changing colors in my real code
[08:33:04] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, ahhh cool, I was wondering why you werent using the widget factory for it
[08:33:08] <jeffsmykil> banisterfiend: try animate({'height', 'auto'}, 'slow');
[08:33:26] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: I've done plugins with the widget factory before and i liked it, but i don't need ui this time around
[08:34:35] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: I just can't figure out how to set new values on anything but init
[08:34:38] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: thanks
[08:34:42] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: where do i put that?
[08:35:03] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: in relation to this line in my ajax call: $('#info').html(data)
[08:35:15] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, yeah thats a big plus of the widget factory is that it does all that checking for you
[08:35:38] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, on the initial call you need to check to see if the plugin has allready been applied
[08:35:49] <Mr_Grim> has anyone seen a hand writing animation library? to render text as if someone is writing it with a PEN?
[08:36:12] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, make your own setOption method
[08:36:20] <scottc5> Mr_Grim yeah let me find it for you
[08:36:25] <scottc5> using it on a project
[08:36:38] <Mr_Grim> thankts scotc5
[08:36:50] <jeffsmykil> oh, djquery thats where my confusion was because this part is so easy in the widget plugin
[08:37:09] <NoWired> jquery (or jqueryui) has something for create grids?
[08:37:14] <jeffsmykil> djQuery:  so a setOption method that takes options and the function to call afterwards?
[08:37:24] <scottc5> Mr_Grim: http://keith-wood.name/signature.html
[08:37:48] <jeffsmykil> banisterfiend: chain it
[08:37:58] <jeffsmykil> (data).animate({})
[08:38:14] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, yeah   $('selector').plugin().plugin('setOption', {options object}).plugin('methodcall')
[08:38:29] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: so the full line looks like: $('#info').html(data).animate({}) ?
[08:38:43] <Teduardo> djQuery: Is there a way to clear the class="" before changing it?
[08:38:43] <jeffsmykil> banisterfiend: plus the code i have you before
[08:39:02] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: not going to lie, that part was confusing
[08:39:17] <djQuery> Teduardo, $('selector').attr('class', '');
[08:39:49] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: why not $('selector').(['method', options]);
[08:40:07] <djQuery> Teduardo, but that last example worked for me
[08:40:15] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, hopefully
[08:41:01] <djQuery> havent ever done a regular plugin
[08:41:16] <jeffsmykil> I appreciate your eyes djQuery
[08:41:39] * djQuery bats lashes
[08:41:50] <Luke23ae> If I use $.get(url, {success: function(data){ console.log(data) }} --> undefined will be logged. If I call that same url in my browser, I can see results. the url is on the same domain, no cross site stuff. how can that be?
[08:41:56] <veQue> keyup keydown not quite doing the trick.. is there something i can use whenever the value of a textfield changes?
[08:42:50] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: any sea if the defaults will persist?
[08:42:58] <jeffsmykil> or will it go back on the next call
[08:43:32] <carpii> Luke, try putting the url inside the {options packet}
[08:43:43] <carpii> sorry, ignore that
[08:43:45] <djQuery> veQue, go look and see what the jquery.ui.autocomplete plugin does
[08:43:48] <carpii> i was thinking you were using $,ajax
[08:44:19] <Teduardo> djQuery: anyway; i think tablesorter is preventing the coloring from working
[08:45:31] <djQuery> Teduardo, click the row then right click on it and inspect element and see what rules are being applied to it
[08:45:52] <jeffsmykil> djQuery: are you on twitter?
[08:46:03] <djQuery> didn't think table sorter did anything to the styling of rows
[08:46:15] <gaf> hello, I'm looking for information in how jquery interacts with vanilla js. i've been studying js for some time, and now i'm trying to build a simple text based game. so i have all this pure javascript objects:player, world, etc, etc, than i have another object called scene. after all this objects are instantiated, i need to communicate with the player, and capture input and write output. there is where i think jquery may come handy. but I'm not sure how would
[08:46:15] <gaf>  the jquery bit would interact with my objects...confused
[08:46:45] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, got an account but have never twitted anything
[08:46:53] <jeffsmykil> ah
[08:47:16] <Teduardo> djquery: it seems to be adding class = "odd" class = "even"
[08:47:38] <jeffsmykil> I have no interest in following that djQuery ;)
[08:48:44] <djQuery> jeffsmykil, wish G+ would allow me to classify my posts
[08:49:19] <djQuery> imagine being able to follow someone that has lots of intrest but only look at thier #javascript posts
[08:49:23] <Krambiorix> hi guys, what's wrong with my code? http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:49:25] <jeffsmykil> there is a good js community on G+ I wish i could make myself use it
[08:49:38] <Krambiorix> the url would be http://jsfiddle.net/qkz3Y/
[08:49:44] <djQuery> Krambiorix, WOW you wrote jsfiddle.net?
[08:50:09] <banisterfiend> Krambiorix: impressive
[08:50:09] <dEPy> when I have an element how do I select based on it? for example:   var table_row = $("......");  now I want TD's inside that
[08:50:17] <Krambiorix> :p
[08:50:21] <NoiseEee> dEPy: find()
[08:50:26] <dEPy> ah right
[08:50:29] <dEPy> silly me
[08:51:07] <Krambiorix> anyone serious?
[08:51:30] <Teduardo> okay; so it looks like i got that
[08:52:44] <Krambiorix>  my link would be: http://jsfiddle.net/qkz3Y/
[08:52:45] <jeffsmykil> Krambiorix: i would guess one of your classes is off
[08:53:03] <jeffsmykil> but I would have to go to the documentation page and compare your code to their code
[08:53:07] <jeffsmykil> and you can do that
[08:53:12] <Rajni> Hi guys
[08:53:54] <kristofers> What should i use to add the sum in an input ?
[08:54:06] <kristofers> .append isn't working
[08:54:19] <kristofers> i can see in figrebug the sum being added
[08:54:23] <kristofers> but visually i don't see anything
[08:54:30] <jeffsmykil> add the sum in an input?
[08:54:37] <Krambiorix> jeffsmykil, yeah other urls needed
[08:54:40] <jeffsmykil> so you are adding a number to an input number
[08:54:47] <kristofers> input field
[08:54:56] <kristofers> i got 3 fields
[08:55:02] <kristofers> A + B = C
[08:55:07] <kristofers> i want to add the sum in the C input field
[08:55:17] <jeffsmykil> parseInt on the values
[08:55:38] <jeffsmykil> parseInt(a, 10) + parseInt(b, 10)
[08:55:46] <jeffsmykil> other wise you are adding strings
[08:56:41] <josefrichter> please, I'm looking for a lightweight mobile UI framework, something like jQ Mobile, but with just basic stuff like page transitions, etc. I don't need all the styled lists, I don't need cross platform stuff (iPhone only is OK). Any suggestions please?
[08:57:40] <kristofers> Well it still doing the same thing
[08:57:45] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: given a string of html, how do i get an html element out of it? (so i can call methods on it like 'width' etc)
[08:57:59] <kristofers> i can see the correct value in firebug but nothing visually
[08:58:01] <jeffsmykil> kristofers: working on a fiddle hold on
[09:01:02] <Teduardo> djQuery: The class on the table is over riding selected on the row
[09:01:03] <jeffsmykil> kristofers: http://jsfiddle.net/AjEEj/
[09:01:14] <djQuery> Krambiorix, sorry I don't see anything wrong with it
[09:01:16] <Teduardo> djQuery: anyway to alleviate that?
[09:01:35] <djQuery> Teduardo, thats not the way that css works
[09:01:41] <jeffsmykil> banisterfiend: i think it has to be in the dom to get the width
[09:01:43] <djQuery> what browser are u using?
[09:01:55] <djQuery> can yo u pm me a link to the actual site?
[09:02:04] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: damn
[09:02:08] <Teduardo> djQuery: if I go into firebug and delete the class="" off of the table the row coloring works
[09:02:34] <Krambiorix> djQuery, the urls weren't correct
[09:03:09] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: oh looks like $(string) can do it
[09:03:14] <djQuery> banisterfiend,  set the right to -5000px with a postition absolute add it to the document check the width then remove it
[09:03:18] <banisterfiend> jeffsmykil: soi can just go: $(string).width ?
[09:03:29] <jeffsmykil> if the string is a selector
[09:03:33] <djQuery> sorry set the left not the right
[09:05:24] <Teduardo> djQuery: it seems like table.tablesorter tbody td is what is being applied to it
[09:06:14] <Forbidd3n> how would I pass a variable to a custom rule
[09:06:32] <Forbidd3n> I tried jQuery('#reg').rules("add", {required:true, messages: {required: msg}});
[09:06:35] <Forbidd3n> but give error
[09:06:41] <sunuslee> hi! anyone using jquery-chosen here? how to add icon to those entry?
[09:07:01] <kristofers> what's the 10 for ?
[09:08:04] <jeffsmykil> kristofers: its the radix
[09:08:16] <jeffsmykil> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[09:08:45] <kristofers> Alright thanks alot
[09:08:48] <jeffsmykil> so you can parse hex and decimal, and binary with parseint
[09:08:55] <jeffsmykil> the 10 tells it decimal
[09:08:55] <kristofers> First time i'm trying to calculate something in javascript
[09:09:08] <jeffsmykil> be careful with floating point
[09:09:13] <jeffsmykil> it probably won't work very well
[09:09:39] <kristofers> i think i saw a jquery library for calculation
[09:09:57] <jeffsmykil> it can be a bitch
[09:10:01] <jeffsmykil> especially with money
[09:10:31] <kristofers> I'm making an app to track expense profit loss etc.. so not sure what to do
[09:11:03] <jeffsmykil> i would find a good library for dealing with money
[09:11:54] <NoiseEee> yeah well if you want one that works on computers you're out of luck
[09:12:03] <jeffsmykil> lol
[09:12:47] <jeffsmykil> for time I don't leave the house without momentjs
[09:13:14] <hadifarnoud> I have Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier on line 327 https://gist.github.com/hadifarnoud/44bf107f75d55acb1b01#file-pie-diagram-js-L327
[09:13:20] <hadifarnoud> no clue why
[09:13:42] <Rajni> i have 3 <ul>, with 3 <li> inside each. I want to run a transition when i switch from one ul to another, basically i want to slide out every li individually but im not getting the desired affect, please take a look at this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rncjK/1/
[09:14:27] <Rajni> must be something simple but im not getting it :( thanks in advance.
[09:14:58] <grafi> hadifarnoud , the line above that  testmassive2.push(['Device Unavailable',testmassive[0][1]);  either there is one ] missing or the first [ is too much
[09:15:13] <Rajni> http://jsfiddle.net/rncjK/7/
[09:15:21] <kristofers> jeffsmykil: anyways thanks for your help will try and find a library or something
[09:15:49] <hadifarnoud> Rajni: you wont believe how many times I looked. cheers
[09:15:56] <hadifarnoud> I meant grafi
[09:16:06] <Rajni> lol
[09:16:08] <grafi> new set of eyes ;)
[09:19:26] <Rajni> any clue guys?
[09:27:35] <AMcP> Rajni: The loop is not doing what you hope when you iterate over the LIs
[09:28:15] <AMcP> $('#'+id).children('li').each will loop over each one effectively instantly, and animate them all out over 500ms
[09:28:39] <AMcP> So the code is right, but what you want to do is when each one is done animating, start hiding the next one
[09:30:41] <Rajni> AMcP hum.. how can accomplish that? shall i change the news_enter and news_exit?
[09:30:57] <AMcP> Check out $.Deferred and the 'complete' option that you can pass to .hide()
[09:31:23] <AMcP> when i've hidden one and it's done animating, hide the next one, and the next one. when all of those animations are done, start showing the new ones
[09:32:27] <Rajni> so i only need one function for the two parts of the transition right?
[09:33:30] <Rajni> once i have one function for each transition i thought the logic would be like u said.. once "news_exit" is complete it runs "news_enter"
[09:40:03] <Rajni> AMcP i'll review my code according to what u said, thank you very much ;)
[09:41:41] <Teduardo> does anyone know how you can pull the contents of 'data-tbb' on a submitted <form> tag into a var?
[09:42:22] <hadifarnoud> I have three variable I want to print in HTML from https://gist.github.com/hadifarnoud/e11128863abaf5a65a56#file-pie-diagram-js-L325-L328. how can I do that?
[09:43:55] <hadifarnoud> I assume because these variables are inside a function, I cannot use them outside the function?
[09:47:09] <Validatorian> Anyone know of other examples of "inconsequential multi-user interaction" like the background of http://nodeknockout.com/ -- or know if there's a common name for that that I can search for?
[09:47:23] <basiclaser> just checking out twitter bootstrap for the first time.. its awesome. :D
[09:47:55] <NoiseEee> hadifarnoud: declare the variables outside the function
[09:49:51] <hadifarnoud> NoiseEee: is there any global variable in jQuery?
[09:50:03] <veQue> djQuery: thanks
[09:50:16] <veQue> but i'm not so sure i canuse the autocomplete
[09:50:57] <veQue> ideally it seems to work ok, i'd just need a peice of the code
[09:51:04] <NoiseEee> hadifarnoud: jquery is javascript.  you could assign (pollute) the global namespace and just  window.someGlobalVar = 'cant believe i polluted'
[09:51:25] <scottc5> so for this issue: one $.ajax request response piped into a dialog open, it needs to be wrapped underneath one node otherwise each html node will spawn its own dialog
[09:51:33] <scottc5> I have a question about the jquery-ui dialog. I am loading in some html, and it seems like for every href in the returned html it triggers another overlay, so 1 dialog that contains 5 links gives me 6 overlays. I can't figure out why it would do that?
[09:51:35] <scottc5> that issue
[09:51:54] <scottc5> ignore the question thats for http://irc.jquery.org
[09:52:58] <veQue> my trouble is keypress changes the value but not really, key up gets the correct value but it's too slow
[09:54:18] <hadifarnoud> NoiseEee: believe it or not, I have no js knowledge. Google done most of the work for me. I have no idea how to do it. suppose I want to put them in a HTML file. is there a 'clean' way?
[09:54:35] <NoiseEee> hadifarnoud: i don't know what you mean by HTML file.
[09:55:30] <hadifarnoud> my app is php and jquery. on php side, I can change the content printing.
[09:56:00] <hadifarnoud> $content .= '<div id="broadcast-subject-title"></div>….
[09:56:02] <hadifarnoud> it's something like
[09:56:22] <hadifarnoud> so that bit is HTML in $content NoiseEee
[09:57:00] <NoiseEee> hadifarnoud: yes, you can update the DOM / document with jQuery.
[09:57:17] <NoiseEee> hadifarnoud: fwiw i'm not the person to 'teach' someone online / who has no knowledge, so good luck
[09:57:19] <TonkaTruck> I've been using Netbeans forever and I'm done with it today.  I need support for js, els, php, html, css, less, sass.  Any recommendations?
[09:57:26] <TonkaTruck> An IDE I mean.
[09:57:33] <NoiseEee> TonkaTruck: phpstorm
[09:57:41] <TonkaTruck> js, ejs
[09:57:48] <NoiseEee> supports them
[09:57:49] <TonkaTruck> NoiseEee: Ok, thanks I will try it.
[09:58:06] <TonkaTruck> NoiseEee: Also less and sass css?
[09:58:11] <NoiseEee> yep

[10:06:51] <scriptraptor> Hi guys, fadeOut is causing a weird scrollbar glitch (Chrome), looks almost like gfx artifacting. anyone know why this is happening or how to stop it? a work around is using jquery to force overflow hidden and hide the scrollbar before faadeout
[10:10:06] <priyanshu> help me out guys in jquery
[10:10:16] <priyanshu> i am mew to it
[10:13:42] <Forbidd3n> prime: please just post your question.
[10:16:47] <Teduardo> can anyone take a quick look at this and tell me why it doesn't seem to load the result of the ajax into a dialog? http://jsfiddle.net/5m4yr/
[10:17:43] <Forbidd3n> can you put a full url so we can see the output
[10:18:05] <Teduardo> all the page support.php?... etc does is say "nblsmldnmdlndlndlndl"
[10:18:08] <Teduardo> at the moment
[10:18:36] <Forbidd3n> ok, you are setting that element
[10:18:52] <Forbidd3n> $(nblsmldnmdlndlndlndl)
[10:19:13] <inad922> hello
[10:19:16] <Forbidd3n> what are you trying to do, set the response html to the dialog window?
[10:19:28] <Teduardo> yep
[10:19:45] <Forbidd3n> is tid the id of the dialog window?
[10:19:48] <inad922> If I have a jquery tag and I want to select a given tag among the descendants of that tag how can I do that?
[10:20:04] <Forbidd3n> inad922: maybe .find(...)
[10:20:05] <Teduardo> tid is the ticket id which gets passed to ticket_id in the ajax call
[10:20:09] <inad922> ow
[10:20:12] <inad922> thanks Forbidd3n
[10:20:21] <Teduardo> oops
[10:20:23] <Forbidd3n> ok what is the id of dialog window
[10:20:46] <Forbidd3n> also you need to change row_id to tid
[10:20:56] <Teduardo> righto; i just realized that when you asked about it
[10:21:15] <Teduardo> as far as the id of the dialog window i just assumed it would create a new window; do I need to make a <div></div> for dialog?
[10:21:33] <Forbidd3n> ok so you want to create a new window on the fly
[10:21:36] <Forbidd3n> and then add data
[10:21:55] <Teduardo> i just want a box to popup on the page with a form in it
[10:22:13] <Teduardo> the contents of the form comes from the ajax call
[10:22:49] <Teduardo> if i need to specify a <div> for dialog thats no big deal
[10:22:54] <cramrod> Help!
[10:22:54] <cramrod> I have a handful of jquery elements centered in the screen.  Im using  .fadeOut to make them disappear but instead of disappearing entirely, they go to about 80 opacity then slide up and off the screen.   Has anyone seen this before?
[10:23:13] <Teduardo> i just need to know how to tell dialog to load the results of the ajax call into #adiv
[10:23:49] <priyanshu> hey guys i want to add multiple li containing couple of input fields and also the delete button inside li to remove particular li
[10:24:49] <Forbidd3n> Teduardo second I will write somethign up for you
[10:26:10] <NChief> when using height() on a hidden(display:none) element, shouldnt it show 0?
[10:27:42] <djQuery> priyanshu, and?  what issues are you having with it
[10:27:45] <Forbidd3n> Teduardo: try this
[10:27:45] <Forbidd3n> http://jsfiddle.net/UFzcw/
[10:28:08] <Teduardo> by the way just.. um -- quick opinion question.. if you were viewing a trouble ticket and you wanted to reply to it and you click the reply button what would you personally expect to happen?
[10:28:12] <didiergm> Nchief what are you getting ?
[10:28:24] <Forbidd3n> Teduardo: you should be able to take what I gave you and exand on it to get what you need working
[10:29:05] <NChief> didiergm: height of the element when shown
[10:29:27] <NChief> but its hidden..
[10:29:28] <djQuery> $('#myUl').on('click', '.btnDelete', function(){ $(this).remove(); }).append('<li><button>Delete</button></li>'(;
[10:29:46] <djQuery> priyanshu, ^^^
[10:29:54] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: any idea on how to pass a variable to create a custom message for validation rules?
[10:30:13] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, havent looked at it in a while
[10:30:25] <Forbidd3n> I can't seem to find anything on how to do it
[10:30:54] <priyanshu> i want to add button on it s click want to generate new box having multiple fields
[10:31:05] <didiergm> nChief this is weird, I could have sworn finding more that one instance of people saying that it is indeed 0; on the other hand I find it much more handy in many instances to have the real height. Which version of JQ are you using ?
[10:31:13] <priyanshu> dot no how to start
[10:31:25] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, realy http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3337789/jquery-validate-custom-message-not-working
[10:32:42] <Teduardo> Forbidd3n: So when ajax makes its call, the results get stored in data supposedly right?
[10:32:48] <Stilo> whats the name of the effect when you move the cursor to an object and the border get another size?
[10:33:58] <didiergm> NChief I am trying to setup a jsfiddle but it is taking ahes to connect
[10:34:07] <didiergm> errm ages
[10:34:14] <djQuery> didiergm, try jsbin.com instead
[10:34:18] <Forbidd3n> Teduardo: no supposedly, it does
[10:34:28] <didiergm> djQuery kk
[10:34:33] <cramrod> I was just about to comment on jsfiddle being down
[10:34:34] <Teduardo> nevermind, lol the form is submitting which is making the page reload
[10:34:38] <Teduardo> im so dumb
[10:37:18] <ravenzz> hey Cork
[10:39:12] <djQuery> Forbidd3n, that work for your validation issue
[10:42:08] <naeluh> Is jsfiddle down?
[10:42:25] <Forbidd3n> djQuery: it works, I had a stupid mispelling
[10:44:24] <NChief> didiergm: Ok, thanks.. latest version
[10:47:12] <awc737> why in the hell is this triggering twice! two alerts: $("#rate_submit .green_btn_content").click(function(e){   alert(this)	});
[10:47:14] <naeluh> I got a 502 bad gatewya but when i do a ping test it say its up
[10:50:19] <hdon> hi all :) i am writing a function for my own convenience that is used for type coercion among the types used in my web-based application. i have an internal representation, a human-readable string representation, and a DOM representation consisting of nested DOM nodes. i'd like to add support for jquery sets (is that the correct term?) and i am wondering what the correct way to determine if something is a jquery set is
[10:50:48] <hdon> i incorrectly tried $('span') instanceof $.fn because i thought jquery sets inherited from $.fn, but of course, they do not
[10:51:06] <hdon> oh, instanceof jQuery
[10:51:09] <hdon> :)
[10:57:16] <buzzedword> my boss just dug up this gem from a while back. thought you guys would appreciate it: http://1997.texasjavascript.com/
[10:58:15] <systemfault> Best viewed in 640 x 480 :D
[10:59:16] <naeluh> Hi I have 4 divs that I wanted to show consecutively but use the same button to show or hid them so basically the button has to switch its click to show function to 4 different divs let me know if I can explain better
[11:00:06] <BillCriswell> buzzedword: Awesome.
[11:00:15] <basiclaser> naeluh: set them as the same class
[11:00:17] <cramrod> Oh my goodness.
[11:00:24] <cramrod> There is nothing on that page that isnt ancient
[11:00:43] <naeluh> basiclaser: seriously will that work?
[11:00:56] <naeluh> basiclaser: ok I wil try it
[11:01:16] <basiclaser> do you want to show them all at the same time? or one after the other? If you want to show them at the same time it will work
[11:01:33] <naeluh> basiclaser: one after the other
[11:01:42] <naeluh> yeah all at the same time
[11:01:43] <BillCriswell> buzzedword: How much was a ticket?
[11:01:48] <naeluh> NOT
[11:01:53] <naeluh> oops
[11:02:15] <naeluh> basiclaser: wouldnt they need unique classes then
[11:02:22] <basiclaser> consecutively or simultaeneously?
[11:02:32] <naeluh> consecutive
[11:02:43] <basiclaser> ok in that can ask someone else i am a noob too :D
[11:02:48] <basiclaser> case*
[11:03:20] <naeluh> basiclaser: cool I will try a couple more thing I can create duplicate divs but I want to show specific divs
[11:03:59] <naeluh> te button would have to change its click function when clicked
[11:04:03] <basiclaser> separate ID's will show separate elements, but from the same button, that will require some sort of list or array function
[11:04:25] <guideX> is there any way to trigger a resize event to resize an iframe on the iframes ajax complete?
[11:04:32] <guideX> so the height is always 100%?
[11:04:49] <cramrod> Will someone explain to me how .fadeOut because the documentation isnt doing it for me
[11:05:16] <buzzedword> BillCriswell: I'm trying to find that out right now
[11:06:13] <cramrod> I have ten divs centered in the screen.  When I use .fadeOut at different speeds, they fade a little then move upwards off the screen.  Anyone know why?
[11:06:57] <iamntz> cramrod:  change opacity to zero then hide it
[11:07:17] <iamntz> cramrod: probably you may want to use fadeTo() instead?
[11:07:23] <cramrod> Thats probably a good workaround.  Any idea why it moves off the screen?
[11:07:35] <cramrod> Ill take a look at fadeTo
[11:07:53] <Drager> So I'm making a content slider; http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/ I'm currently stuck trying to create a prev button so the previous image will be showed. And if I spam the "Next" it will bug. Any ideas?
[11:09:16] <cramrod> jsfiddle must be back up.  Hooray!
[11:10:16] <Drager> cramrod: jsfiddle is up
[11:11:07] <naeluh> yeah its bac up
[11:11:25] <basiclaser> why was it down?
[11:11:43] <Drager> basiclaser: Updates to the site I believe
[11:11:50] <basiclaser> o i c
[11:12:25] <booom> http://pastebin.com/5xY4UZ80
[11:13:20] <booom> dudes why this returns always pixel and not percentage ?
[11:13:23] <booom> i need %
[11:14:01] <cramrod> iamntz: fadeTo worked beautifully for my purposes.  Thanks.
[11:15:33] <guideX> so with cross domain iframe, there's no way to auto height?
[11:15:48] <guideX> or is there some trick
[11:17:21] <naeluh> I am really stuck on show 4 unique divs consecutively with a single button I can easily show them all at the same time but is there a $('#btnAdd').click(function() that would allow me to show them consecutively I am just lookign for some direction if someone know s
[11:18:53] <guyz> I'm getting a "uncaught referenceError: $ is not defined" yet first file called is jquery then jquery ui
[11:19:30] <iamntz> guyz: try to use jQuery instead of $
[11:19:41] <iamntz> probably it's a noConflict somewhere ?
[11:20:33] <guyz> iamntz@ i'm not sure what you mean by use jquery instead of $
[11:21:16] <iamntz> ok, so.... if you have $('div').sortable()
[11:21:24] <iamntz> just use jQuery('div').sortable() instead
[11:21:33] <guyz> oh
[11:21:38] <guyz> easy enough
[11:21:40] <iamntz> make sense?
[11:22:02] <iamntz> you could also wrap your code into jQuery(document).ready(function($){ //your code goes here// })
[11:22:04] <guyz> makes for a lot of updatin code tho
[11:22:09] <iamntz> and get rid of this :)
[11:22:18] <iamntz> ** which means will work as it is
[11:22:25] <guyz> would that be a "standardized" way of doing it?
[11:22:35] <iamntz> i just told you :)\
[11:23:11] <guyz> i'm just curious becuase all the examples and code i've downloaded all used $
[11:23:22] <guyz> so i'd hate to have to re-write everything
[11:24:30] <iamntz> well, it's a good practice to scope your code to avoid conflicts anyway :)
[11:24:51] <iamntz> you could just wrap everything into that small snippet of code and that's it
[11:25:05] <iamntz> see the first example here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Context
[11:25:56] <iamntz> and also first point on summary: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Summary_and_Best_Practices
[11:28:43] <gaf> hello, can you point me some code, where plain js is used in conjunction with jquery? it doesn't need to be complex, more educative, i would say
[11:29:16] <kristofers> Can anyone explain how to use .each ?
[11:29:28] <iamntz> gaf: $(document).ready(function(){ alert('hello world'); }) :)
[11:29:47] <hlve> i like that gangsta shit
[11:29:53] <hlve> oops. wrong channel
[11:30:00] <iamntz> kristofers: do you know how loops works?
[11:30:14] <kristofers> you mean generally speaking ?
[11:30:16] <kristofers> or in javascript
[11:30:21] <iamntz> generally
[11:30:23] <kristofers> yes
[11:30:38] <kristofers> i got multiple anchor tag with the same class
[11:30:38] <iamntz> and loop over an array?
[11:30:48] <kristofers> and i'm trying to add the same functionality to all
[11:30:53] <kristofers> and it's only being added to the first one
[11:31:07] <iamntz> well, so, it's all about context :)
[11:31:14] <hlve> kristofers: http://www.jquery4u.com/jquery-functions/jquery-each-examples/
[11:31:23] <gaf> iamntz, oh, i see, so the native alert method is there inside ^^, what about if i have pure js objects, that i want to manipulate. would i need to instantiate inside of  $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[11:31:51] <iamntz> $('div.foo').each(function( i, element ){ $(element).fadeIn(); })
[11:31:55] <iamntz> or whatever
[11:31:59] <iamntz> gaf: yes
[11:33:04] <gaf> like,  $(document).ready(function(){ var objectInstance = new Object(); $....})?
[11:33:30] <iamntz> like anything actually. you know that jquery IS javascript afterall, yes? :)
[11:34:02] <gaf> duh, i know, but it is funny to understand sometimes :). i know only pure js, never used jquery
[11:34:28] <Gho5t> then you know that ready is an event and you are simply binding an anonymous function to it
[11:34:30] <Gho5t> so why ask
[11:34:32] <Gho5t> bam
[11:36:13] <naeluh> hlve: hey I think that helped me a bit thanks
[11:36:38] <Forbidd3n> Any way to clear a watermark field and retain the watermark?
[11:36:44] <naeluh> hlve: what you send kristofers
[11:36:50] <Forbidd3n> I tried ($'#element').val('');
[11:36:52] <naeluh> sent*
[11:37:04] <Drager> So I'm making a content slider; http://jsfiddle.net/6x3UN/ I'm currently stuck trying to create a prev button so the previous image will be showed. And if I spam the "Next" it will bug. Any ideas?
[11:37:07] <Forbidd3n> it removes the value, but doesn't show the watermark again
[11:37:35] <kristofers> Sorry was afk
[11:37:36] <xsamurai> using on for future elements is not working with the following statment select[name*='category'],select[name*='sub']").on('change',function()
[11:38:03] <xsamurai> it works on jsfiddle if the elements exist prior
[11:38:41] <gaf> Gho5t, i said i know js, never said i was an expert, don't need to be rude
[11:38:45] <systemfault> xsamurai: .on has two syntaxes, the one you're using at the moment is traditional event handling... it won't work for future elements
[11:39:02] <Gho5t> sorry then
[11:39:22] <systemfault> xsamurai: You probably want: $(document).on("change", "select[name*='category'],select[name*='sub']",function() {});
[11:40:04] <xsamurai> systemfault: didnt know I could specify selector like that
[11:40:05] <zCoder> hi. Can someone please help me? i get alert undefined when i should be showing URL http://pastebin.com/gRL7bSDx  can anyone see why?
[11:40:06] <systemfault> xsamurai: Be careful with the change event using delegation and older IEs...
[11:40:12] <xsamurai> thanks =)
[11:40:45] <xsamurai> systemfault: detect IE, redirect user to firefox download page, im beyond sick of supporting IE in general , let alone old IE
[11:41:02] <systemfault> xsamurai: If you can do that, wonderful :)
[11:43:35] <xsamurai> systemfault: thanks though , that fixed it
[11:45:52] <Fenikkusu> Could I get some opinions on this code please? IE Suggestions, Is It Up To Par, Proper Syntax, Etc. : http://jsfiddle.net/wWLDe/
[11:46:58] <Forbidd3n> anyone?
[11:47:02] <Forbidd3n> Any way to clear a watermark field and retain the watermark?
[11:47:10] <Forbidd3n> I tried ($'#element').val(''); -- it removes the value, but doesn't show the watermark again
[11:47:24] <NoiseEee> a watermark field?
[11:47:36] <Forbidd3n> yeas
[11:47:37] <Forbidd3n> yes
[11:47:44] <NoiseEee> i dont know what that is Forbidd3n
[11:47:56] <Forbidd3n> sorry a textbox with a watermark set to it
[11:48:19] <NoiseEee> what is this 'watermark' you speak of
[11:48:37] <Forbidd3n> the jquery watermark plugin
[11:49:30] <awc737> could binding a .change(function(e) multiple times to the same element cause it to fire as many times as it was bound
[11:49:45] <awc737> so if I change the checkbox, but it is my third time binding it, it might alert 3 times?
[11:50:02] <systemfault> About time you found that..
[11:51:21] <NoiseEee> awc737: yes, yes.
[11:51:41] <awc737> omg, you have no idea how happy I am to figure that out
[11:52:15] <awc737> I have been going in a circle of 20-30 functions 500 lines of code, figuring out wtf was causing it to loop
[11:52:28] <awc737> for 2 hours
[11:53:34] <Forbidd3n> NoiseEee: any feedback?
[11:55:03] <NoiseEee> Forbidd3n: no idea about that plugin, sorry
[11:55:18] <NoiseEee> awc737: sounds like you could use event delegation, or .off(), or a bit of both
[11:55:35] <awc737> yeah but were in version 1.6.2 or something, so no .on .off
[11:55:51] <awc737> plus this is a pretty large "component" I didn't write but I have to debug
[11:55:52] <awc737> lol
[11:56:44] <awc737> oh no... its still looping... noOOOOOO
[11:57:33] <awc737> i could shoot myself
[11:58:14] <Forbidd3n> awc737: post snippet of code so we can look at it for you
[11:58:37] * gaf gets a gun for awc737
[11:58:50] <awc737> gafs option is easier
[11:59:08] * gaf provides bullets too
[12:00:06] <AxonetBE1> I get always live is not a function on line 4 http://pastebin.com/kQ3aj470, I use jquery 1.9.1
[12:00:59] <rychol> hi
[12:01:05] <AxonetBE1> seems that it is on now instead of live
[12:01:07] <Ring0`> Hi. I need to send lot of data via cross-domain. For this I want to use jsonproxy but such large get requests are not supported (over 100k - images), Is there any good approach for that, better than splitting it into multiple jsonp requests?
[12:01:09] <NoiseEee> AxonetBE1: yep
[12:01:24] <NoiseEee> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ @ AxonetBE1
[12:02:28] <keirlav87> how can i initialise sliders on elements that i've just added to the dom?
[12:03:08] <awc737> update* solved! there were more than a few places the original author did note use one.('event'
[12:03:35] <bil`> Is there a better way to find something by a dynamic data attribute other than just building a selector string like .find('[data-question-id="' + this.qData.question_id + '"]')
[12:04:35] <rychol> http://wklej.to/f1Eim
[12:04:43] <rychol> overall it wanted to do to change the message after the time
[12:05:09] <rychol> but it does look different.
[12:06:06] <rychol> for example, after 10 minutes to change the text, for example, Off.
[12:06:29] <keirlav87> is it possible to initialise jquery ui slider on an element that has been dynamically added to the dom, and can anyone advise on how i would do this?
[12:06:30] <basiclaser> hey guys you know how you can specify which elements you want to get or modify by writing 'this' 'index' 'element' etc. can you write 'parent' to affect the parent div of the function?
[12:07:00] <bil`> keirlav87: You need to init the slider once the slider target element is part of the dom
[12:07:11] <bil`> not before
[12:07:33] <rajkosto> hi how do i get "Expires" http header from ajax response ?
[12:07:36] <rychol> Only the script I found on google.
[12:08:22] <rychol> wants after 10 minutes changed the text of On to the off.
[12:08:27] <authy> Looking to get the exact height of the document, such that if I set an element to be that height, it will match at a pixel resolution. I can kill the scrollbars with overflow: hidden if I need to, so that isnt a problem, but $('body').height() seems to be producing something too tall
[12:08:33] <authy> considerably too tall, in fact
[12:08:43] <rychol> can not keep anything when it comes to java
[12:11:32] <rychol> a moze jest tutaj jakis polak? ...
[12:11:40] <bil`> authy: try $(document) rather than body
[12:11:46] <bil`> but i doubt that'll work
[12:12:33] <bil`> do you just want to cover the window or the entire height of the entire page
[12:13:54] <authy> bil`: pretty much. i need a full window canvas
[12:14:11] <authy> And it needs to be pretty much pixel exact.
[12:14:22] <bil`> $(window).height()
[12:14:45] <Stilo> i want to drop an element into a box and keep it there without showing any alert
[12:14:58] <bil`> you're prob going to need something to redraw the canvas if the browser is resized though
[12:15:26] <bil`> http://paulirish.com/2009/throttled-smartresize-jquery-event-handler/
[12:17:31] <madprops> any idea how i can get the correct height from #options? http://jsfiddle.net/RYCNq/
[12:18:43] <Fenikkusu> Could I get some opinions on this code please? IE Suggestions, Is It Up To Par, Proper Syntax, Etc. : http://jsfiddle.net/wWLDe/
[12:21:31] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: you don't need this check
[12:21:32] <Hypereive> $objScript.src  = 'http' + ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 's' : '') + "://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&callback=initRciGeoCode";
[12:21:53] <authy> just do: $objScript.src  = "//maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false&callback=initRciGeoCode";
[12:21:57] <Hypereive> wait...
[12:21:59] <Hypereive> yeah
[12:22:26] <zCoder> hi. Can someone please help me? i get alert undefined when i should be showing URL http://pastebin.com/gRL7bSDx  can anyone see why?
[12:23:02] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, Ahh, Thank You.
[12:23:19] <bil`> I'm not sure //url has 100% browser support
[12:23:27] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: $.fn.rci_address_geocodes -> this.initRCIGeoCode You're mixing two naming conventions. Try to be consistent
[12:24:18] <Hypereive> Why do you capitalize every single word in your comment? That's funny.
[12:24:48] <kristofers> I'm going nuts with this .each() lol
[12:25:07] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: $.fn.rci_address_geocodes.item   = [];  item"s"
[12:25:12] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, I come from an original back ground of VB. It's a habit I get into sometimes, even when typing lol
[12:26:14] <Hypereive> Then stop "$" before variables... Js is not PHP :D
[12:26:32] <Hypereive> var $this = this; // Most of the tile you will see "var self = this;"
[12:27:00] <Hypereive> Try to not mix this and $(this)
[12:27:07] <Fenikkusu> Well, $tThis is referencing $(this). I thought it was considered a proper method of storing.
[12:27:08] <Hypereive> If you have $(this) you have the power.
[12:27:14] <bil`> $ in front of var names is a jquery convention to denote jquery objects
[12:27:31] <bil`> that some do
[12:28:28] <Hypereive> hmmm.. But does it make sense when the object wasn't created by jQuery ? such as at line 12?
[12:29:17] <Fenikkusu> Oh...that. Yeah I can fix that.
[12:29:28] <Fenikkusu> That makes sense to fix lol
[12:30:33] <Emn1ty|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/RpxtR/ - not sure if this is a css positioning issue or if there is a js solution (and yes I know its jquery but jquery doesn't solve everything), but currently if I click the popup itself it closes, which isn't what I want.
[12:30:34] <NoobAjax> anyone knows if there is a way to refetch mysql data?
[12:30:38] <NoobAjax> every couple of times
[12:30:56] <Emn1ty|Work> that looks funky but its a copy paste from #javascript
[12:31:07] <Emn1ty|Work> nobody is answering so I'm asking here as well
[12:36:10] <Hypereive> Emn1ty|Work: so what do you want?
[12:36:26] <Emn1ty|Work> I got it fixed
[12:36:31] <Emn1ty|Work> thanks for replying though
[12:36:55] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, on your comment about using two naming conventions. Could you elaborate a bit more on that please?
[12:36:56] <Hypereive> lol... okay
[12:37:01] <Emn1ty|Work> The issue was the click event was bubbling to the next element, causing it to fire on the popup itself
[12:37:11] <Emn1ty|Work> and causing it to hide on click
[12:38:03] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: Hmm some time you use underscore_separated_words some times you are using upperCasedVariableName. It's not good to mix both especially if you want to release your code.
[12:38:15] <Hypereive> it can happens when several people are working at the same time.
[12:38:27] <Hypereive> But when you are alone try to be consistent.
[12:39:24] <Fenikkusu> Hmm...so despite the_names is only used within the $.fn for simulating namespacing, you still believe this to be true?
[12:41:04] <brianpWins> if a couple events are bound to an element with 'on' is there any way to bind another event that has a conditional and if true stops the previously bound events from firing?
[12:43:06] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: 		//Loop Through Each And Complete Load Process.
[12:43:06] <lejocelyn> hey, I'm trying to return json data to a jquery script. I'm don't know why it displays only one result
[12:43:13] <lejocelyn> here the php code : http://pastebin.fr/26487
[12:43:15] <Hypereive> This won't work everywhere
[12:43:40] <Hypereive> When you itterating through an array you should do a classic loop or even better use jQuery's eache
[12:43:41] <Hypereive> each
[12:43:48] <lejocelyn> I use autocomplete else for displaying the result with jquery
[12:44:46] <Fenikkusu> Hmm...I never considered .each for some reason...certainly should have...
[12:45:11] <Stilo> how can i drop an element into a box and keep the image there?
[12:45:43] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: My opinion, but when you are writing a jQuery plugin, you KNOW that jQuery is loaded, so might as well use it. even for a document.createElement (at the beginning)
[12:46:50] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, I can certainly see your point. I think my only thoughts on it is adding the extra overhead of jquery to do processes you can do easily with regular javascript.
[12:46:56] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: Line 253 if (undefined !== varMethod) { Use typeof as you did  at the beginning
[12:47:07] <Hypereive> Why? Because undefined is a valid variable name
[12:47:08] <Hypereive> :D
[12:47:50] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, I'm passing in undefined as a variable that isn't actually being passed in, so within my script undefined is undefined.
[12:48:07] <Hypereive> true
[12:48:15] <Hypereive> That's just a best practice.
[12:48:22] <Hypereive> IF they don't work for you don't bother with them :D
[12:48:44] <Fenikkusu> Ahh I see lol
[12:50:11] <Hypereive> Fenikkusu: Line 238 //If the element doesn't exist, throw an error forcing it to exist. The "else" is useless
[12:50:42] <Hypereive> As your "if" statement already contains a "continue" every following lines will be an "else" if you catch what I mean.
[13:03:08] <tdignan> How can I access the attributes of a draggable element when it is dropped?
[13:04:24] <tdignan> I'm trying ui.draggable
[13:04:31] <tdignan> but for some reason, I can't get access to the attributes
[13:05:43] <sunbeam> Damn, I need to develop a site where the content for the mobile version is in completely different place than the desktop version
[13:06:07] <sunbeam> (eg. some content that goes in the footer in the desktop version is in the header{} in the mobile version)
[13:06:15] <sunbeam> Any idea what I can best do?
[13:07:05] <tdignan> upon further investigation, they're in obj.context.attributes as a namednodemap
[13:07:11] <tdignan> I figured i'd be able to get them with .attr() ?
[13:07:50] <lejocelyn> I must be really tired, what's wrong with this :
[13:07:52] <lejocelyn> initAuto("[name='disciplines_". updateNumber . "']");
[13:08:17] <tdignan> sunbeam: redirect the user to the proper site based on the User-Agent header.
[13:10:19] <lejocelyn> oooh shit
[13:10:34] <sunbeam> tdignan: ok, but what if the user changes his browser width?
[13:10:36] <lejocelyn> it's php concatenation operator
[13:10:39] <BillCriswell> lejocelyn: You're not writing php.
[13:10:40] <lejocelyn> :'(
[13:10:47] <sunbeam> tdignan: then the desktop version isn't responsive
[13:10:52] <tdignan> sunbeam: well, you won't have that problem on the mobile devices.
[13:10:57] <lejocelyn> BillCriswell: pfff thank you
[13:10:59] <tdignan> you can still make the desktop version responsive.
[13:11:04] <tdignan> nothing will stop you from that
[13:11:05] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[13:11:12] <sunbeam> tdignan: but i will on browsers and tablets
[13:11:22] <sunbeam> tdignan: ah yes
[13:11:32] <tdignan> just make it repsonsive *and* use the User-Agent
[13:11:58] <sunbeam> tdignan: and moving some content based on browser width with jquery?
[13:12:23] <tdignan> I don't know how. You can do that with a CSS3 media query much easier
[13:12:57] <sunbeam> tdignan: moving content?
[13:13:18] <tdignan> you can set different CSS rules based on the viewport size
[13:13:26] <tdignan> so sure. you could move something to a different place.
[13:13:49] <sunbeam> tdignan: move the whole object using position: absolute, yes
[13:13:53] <tdignan> if you havent tried it yet give it a go. I used it the other day and it's just awesome
[13:13:55] <kristofers> Do i have to use each ? if i have multiplace anchor tag with the same class ?
[13:14:03] <kristofers> and i'm trying to add something to all of them
[13:14:08] <sunbeam> tdignan: but that's not possible in such case
[13:14:22] <tdignan> I don't see why you'd need to use absolute position. there must be something you know about the problem you're solving that i don't
[13:14:27] <tdignan> i'll leave this for someone else to chime in on.
[13:19:40] <Fenikkusu> Hypereive, Yes I can see that. The main reason I did that route though was for code cleanlyness.
[13:20:53] <Hypereive> hmm.. sorry did not follow
[13:21:27] <tdignan> hm, it's a miracle. attr() works again
[13:21:44] <Hypereive> use prop and stop being deceived :D
[13:26:39] <lejocelyn> is it possible to clone an input that is .autocomplete ?
[13:27:17] <lejocelyn> I do autocomplete on an input from a mysql source
[13:27:24] <lejocelyn> but when I clone it
[13:27:30] <lejocelyn> it doesn't work anymore
[13:28:00] <lejocelyn> I've been working on this for some hours and I'm wondering now if it's like technically possible :(
[13:28:15] <Hypereive> Just call .autocomplete on the clone too.
[13:28:31] <lejocelyn> that's what I do
[13:29:11] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: I've got a function that do initCompletion
[13:29:50] <lejocelyn> each time I create a new input, I init completion on it
[13:33:25] <lejocelyn> jsfiddle is quite slow tonight
[13:33:26] <lejocelyn> no ?
[13:33:38] <Hypereive> hmmm...
[13:33:41] <Hypereive> It was fine with me
[13:34:28] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: the code looks like that : http://jsfiddle.net/LCRd7/1/
[13:36:44] <lejocelyn> shit :D
[13:36:53] <lejocelyn> may be it's time to go sllep
[13:37:47] <naeluh> Hi is there any way .each to show divs with unique classes consecutively? or is that the wrong way to go about something like that ?
[13:38:29] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: something is wrong
[13:38:56] <wachpwnski> what is the default timeout for an ajax call?
[13:39:51] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: I know :(
[13:42:01] <Hypereive> Just a sec
[13:42:26] <lanken> I have a jquery object $("div.test")
[13:42:43] <lanken> I want the .offset() of the nth element in the set
[13:42:46] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: it's about the source
[13:42:58] <lanken> so I did $("div.test")[n].offset(), but I got an error
[13:43:10] <Brodingo> ?eq @ lanken
[13:43:17] <Brodingo> `api eq @ lanken
[13:43:17] <b-ot> lanken: .eq(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:43:28] <lanken> Brodingo: thanks!
[13:44:06] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: and you're saying that it works with autocomplete on the first field right?
[13:44:50] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: yes, I saw one typing error
[13:48:32] <Hypereive> So is it fixed now?
[13:48:42] <lejocelyn> no
[13:48:49] <lejocelyn> I saw a mistake I did
[13:48:56] <lejocelyn> but it doesn't solve the issue
[13:49:24] <lejocelyn> only the first input is being autocompleted
[13:51:08] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: could it be something like the quotes ?
[13:51:46] <naeluh> ok I am racking my brain on this is there a way to show consecutive divs with a single click function I can find anything similar to this through google ?
[13:51:54] <lejocelyn> in one, I use name="languages_3", in the other name='languages_3'
[13:54:05] <lejocelyn> can I use the single quotes : ' instead of the "
[13:54:06] <lejocelyn> ?
[13:55:20] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: sure you can
[13:55:37] <Hypereive> I don't know... I was playing with your fiddle but can't find the answer.
[13:55:51] <lejocelyn> :( strange
[13:56:04] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure the quote thing matters
[13:56:25] <zDog> how would I pass a custom function name that needs to be called to another function?
[13:57:01] <Hypereive> Quotes do not matter, for sure.
[13:57:40] <Hypereive> zDog:  don't pass its name, pass the function itself.
[13:57:52] <zDog> how would i pass the function?
[13:58:28] <Hypereive> function foo() {alert("Yay");}   function bar(callback) {callback(); } ; bar(foo);
[13:59:15] <Hypereive>  // Should alert "Yay"
[14:00:02] <banisterfiend> hey,im filling a div with stuff i get via ajax, how can i 'fade in' the new content i get in the div?
[14:00:23] <NoiseEee> banisterfiend: don't show the div until the content is in it
[14:00:38] <naeluh> I have this fiddle where I can add duplicate element but I am trying to change it show unique elements http://jsfiddle.net/DqGG5/ does any one have any pointers on this ?
[14:00:44] <banisterfiend> NoiseEee: i mean i want an animation to fade it in
[14:01:26] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/ @ banisterfiend
[14:03:07] <banisterfiend> NoiseEee: i'm doign this: $('#info').html(data)     how do i 'fade in' the data? sry, i couldn't figure it out from that page
[14:03:56] <NoiseEee> $('#info').fadeIn()
[14:04:06] <NoiseEee> you fade in the element, not the data
[14:12:26] <banisterfiend> what is the convention for beginning variables with $ in js?
[14:12:53] <Hypereive> Someone told me 1 hour ago that it was for jQuery's objects.
[14:13:06] <banisterfiend> oh cool
[14:13:30] <banisterfiend> Hypereive: thanks
[14:13:58] <NoiseEee> banisterfiend: indeed some people use it to note jquery objects, its all personal preference though
[14:15:33] <banisterfiend> how do i create a div with a given width height (stored in variables) ?
[14:15:39] <banisterfiend> i want to insert that div as the child of another div
[14:15:52] <banisterfiend> i know i can use: $('#parent').html("<div ..>")
[14:16:05] <banisterfiend> but i want to provide width height, is that possible?
[14:16:25] <banisterfiend> or do i append it, give it an id. then modify its css after teh fact?
[14:16:34] <banisterfiend> i geuss that's the only thing tha tmakese sense
[14:17:07] <carpii> you can do $('<div/>' { width: '200px', height: '300px' }).appendTo("#foo");
[14:17:12] <carpii> but i really dont like that syntax
[14:17:24] <Hypereive> $('#parent').append('<div style="width:120px;height:140px'>Pikachu is too cool</div>');
[14:17:36] <carpii> or you could just create a css class for the div, and do .append("<div class="myclass"
[14:17:40] <Hypereive> $('#parent').append('<div style="width:120px;height:140px"'>Pikachu is too cool</div>');
[14:18:02] <Hypereive> Fixe the quote typo though... :D
[14:18:16] <banisterfiend> Hypereive: ya but the thing is the width/height are stored in variables
[14:18:25] <banisterfiend> Hypereive: so i'd have to do some gnarly string interpolation to get that to work, no?
[14:18:41] <carpii> its not really gnarly, its just programming :)
[14:18:58] <banisterfiend> yeah but string interpolation looks kind of ugly in javascript :P
[14:19:10] <banisterfiend> "width:" + width().toString + "px"
[14:19:11] <banisterfiend> no?
[14:19:22] <carpii> you mean concatenation, not interpolation
[14:19:31] <banisterfiend> true
[14:19:36] <banisterfiend> how do i interpolate in js?
[14:20:15] <carpii> hm, i dont know if you can, you have to concat
[14:20:33] <banisterfiend> in ruby it would look like this: "width: #{width}px"
[14:20:40] <carpii> yea
[14:20:53] <carpii> coffeescript provides some helper routines which allow it
[14:20:59] <carpii> but coffeescript is pretty ugly too imo
[14:21:25] <Hypereive> var mySringIsPink = "My string is " + width() "px" + 42 + " whatever " + ' This is call "concatenation btw"';
[14:21:28] <banisterfiend> carpii: ah, cs stole #{} from ruby it seems: http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/strings/interpolation
[14:21:57] <carpii> yeah, probably :p
[14:22:08] <dandaman> weird IE8 issue, maybe someone here has run into it before. I have a function that adds a bunch of fields inside of a <form> tag, when I submit the form and look at the post, i dont see any of those fields that were added when the function is triggered. I see the fields in the post when looking at it in chrome
[14:22:29] <carpii> personally I would just add a div with a css class which means it has display: none
[14:22:38] <carpii> then set the width and height on it using jQuery, and show it
[14:24:27] <carpii> or try var x = $("<div>hello</div>).css({ width: myvar, height: myvar2; });  $("parent").append(x)
[14:25:14] <Hypereive> I wouldn't put oo much thoughts about it.
[14:25:25] <Hypereive> There are more important thing to do in an application.
[14:25:35] <carpii> yeah this is true
[14:26:03] <rrjamie> Is there a good way to get the natural height of an element that is currently animated with CSS?
[14:26:41] <banisterfiend> carpii: that's ncie
[14:26:51] <lejocelyn> what kind of array do need autocomplete from jquery-ui ?
[14:26:55] <lejocelyn> do you use it ?
[14:26:58] <Hypereive> rrjamie: Did you try height() outerHeight() innerHeight() ?
[14:28:15] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: An array like this one
[14:28:29] <Hypereive> var array = [ "Pichu", "pikachu", "raichu"];
[14:29:08] <xiphiasx_> question
[14:29:25] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: are you sure ? that means that autocomplete simply parses the json encoded array ?
[14:29:42] <xiphiasx_> jquery mobile: when using a listview, i want my <a href> to go to a div (i.e. #something), because that triggers an event
[14:30:32] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: yeah
[14:30:42] <rrjamie> Hypereive: I did try height, but it varies with the animation
[14:30:46] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: sorry, I mean, when I provide an array I encode to json with json_encode($array)
[14:31:05] <lejocelyn> what about label and value ?
[14:31:10] <Hypereive> Ah you're doing some PHP
[14:31:45] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: yes
[14:32:03] <rrjamie> Hypereive: same for inner, outerHeight
[14:32:31] <Hypereive> rrjamie: Then you have have to store those value, before starting to animate.
[14:33:00] <Hypereive> I can understand why it would change.
[14:33:46] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: At the most simple case, autocomplete can work with the array I showed you.
[14:35:13] <Hypereive> lejocelyn: Check this out http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[14:38:13] <lejocelyn> Hypereive: I guess it means I need an ID and a value
[14:42:03] <loincloth> does anyone know if there is a channel for mediaelement.js anywhere?
[14:45:39] <Hypereive> Is it open source if it is it's on freenode
[14:45:49] <Hypereive> If not... Then you should ask for its creation :D
[14:49:41] <dogarrhea> kaka. ibm == "indian bowel movement"
[14:49:56] <dogarrhea> (according to someone's blog)
[14:55:55] <Hypereive> Someone's blog can't be trusted.
[14:56:24] <Hypereive> You should confirm this information on Youtube.
[14:56:34] <Hypereive> ... Just to be sure.
[14:56:38] <systemfault> Everything on the internet is true!!!11
[14:56:45] <coldhead> comments on youtube
[14:56:50] <coldhead> for real peace of mind
[14:58:07] <Hypereive> Youtube comments are what make great ideas and science reach a higher state.
[14:58:21] <zDog> if a modalbox I created doesnt center right away due to the contnet not completely loaded yet, how can I have it recenter once its updated?
[15:00:52] <hdon> zDog, one approach is to make sure that all the elements in your modalbox have their dimensions set explicitly
[15:01:34] <hdon> zDog, that assumes of course that you know what their dimensions ought to be
[15:02:46] <garbagegod> I wish to pass a URL with GET params as a GET param... what's the best way?
[15:03:03] <garbagegod> oh, and some of the GET params of the URL I want to send are URL encoded.
[15:04:02] <garbagegod> I was thinking turn the URL I'm sending into a multidimensional object with the url base and parameters, and then send a URI encoded, JSON string of that object
[15:04:13] <garbagegod> Is there an objectively better way?
[15:04:59] <Hypereive> just urlencode the URL that you want to pass.
[15:05:22] <Hypereive> It doesn't matter if it has parameters or not as they will be urlencoded.
[15:06:05] <oblio> hola
[15:06:27] <Hypereive> halo oblio
[15:07:08] <garbagegod> so you're saying it doesn't matter because # will encode to %23 which will be encoded again to %2523 and it all works out?
[15:07:21] <oblio> so, i'm using .backstretch within $(document).ready and like 1 in 10 times the page loads, .backstretch doesnt set the image
[15:07:51] <oblio> what should i do to ensure the image has loaded before it's backstretched?
[15:08:37] <Hypereive> garbagegod: pretty much... yeah
[15:09:02] <garbagegod> Hypereive: that seems sketchy to me, but I guess you're right :)
[15:10:09] <garbagegod> Oh no.. I'm sorry, I asked the wrong question... I definitely need the parameters seperate from the base URL... so.. my real question is... is it OK to pass URI encoded JSON through GET?
[15:11:10] <Che-Anarc> in jqm how to set / have: <input type="file".... have the default button styling & not native browse button?
[15:12:06] <Hypereive> oblio: You might have to use the onload event on your images.
[15:12:40] <Hypereive> garbagegod: It's unconventional to be honest.
[15:12:52] <Hypereive> URLs should not be too long.
[15:13:05] <Hypereive> Prefer POST over GET for JSON
[15:13:19] <carpii> i think unconventional is polite
[15:13:25] <Hypereive> If you really do have no choice... Then go ahead. But keep it short.
[15:13:29] <carpii> its a stupid idea, sorry garbage :/
[15:13:31] <Hypereive> As short as possible.
[15:13:55] <carpii> why cant you just split it out from the URI server side ?
[15:13:57] <Hypereive> lol.... carpii .
[15:13:57] <garbagegod> Hypereive: How would you suggest I do that? This is going from a jquery script to a PHP script, so I guess if I passed the double-encoded URL like we talked about and separated the params with the PHP script
[15:14:01] <carpii> as a normal GET request?
[15:14:42] <carpii> garbage, what problem are you having with PHP specifically?
[15:15:12] <Hypereive> Just use POST
[15:15:18] <Hypereive> it will be so fine for you
[15:15:26] <garbagegod> None... I just want the GET request to be as objectively good as possible in terms of practice
[15:15:39] <carpii> PHP has urldecode, but I agree, use POST
[15:17:01] <garbagegod> but data sent through POST is encoded very similarly to data sent through GET, or so I thought
[15:17:53] <carpii> which aspect of your application is even encoding anything?
[15:18:29] <carpii> sorry ignore that, I was thinking I was in #node.js
[15:18:53] <Hypereive> garbagegod: no no that's not the same.
[15:19:02] <Hypereive> POST and GET a REALLY different.
[15:19:14] <Hypereive> From the HTTP point of view.
[15:19:26] <Hypereive> Event if PHP and jQuery make them seem similar they are not.
[15:19:45] <Hypereive> And there are time when you should use POST and times where you should use GET
[15:20:07] <Hypereive> And there are even limitation with GET or some with POST (not talking about DELETE)
[15:21:52] <garbagegod> Okay
[15:22:48] <garbagegod> so... how should I structure it now that I'm using POST?
[15:24:12] <carpii> how are you sending it? Is this just an HTML form, or some ajax request?
[15:24:43] <naeluh> so is there anyone that would take a look at my fiddle ? I am really stuck
[15:25:05] <garbagegod> It's a URL, containing several GET parameters of (sometimes) encoded entities
[15:25:20] <garbagegod> so basically just your garden variety moderately complex URL
[15:25:34] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/DqGG5/ I want to try modify this script to display unique divs rather duplicating the div
[15:25:35] <naeluh> thanks
[15:25:53] <carpii> garbage, just post it to PHP and see what needs doing to it
[15:26:17] <carpii> you might need to decode it, or maybe you should parse_url and then decode each param
[15:26:22] <carpii> its hard to say with the info youre giving
[15:26:37] <garbagegod> that's fine
[15:26:42] <garbagegod> I guess simpler is better
[15:26:46] <garbagegod> thanks
[15:27:04] <Hypereive> naeluh: tell use more.
[15:27:08] <Hypereive> us
[15:27:33] <Hypereive> Then I'm really going to sleep... My typo rate is just too high.
[15:28:25] <cramrod> anyone even heard of a .fadeTo callback executing before the fade completes?
[15:28:55] <cramrod> ever*
[15:29:25] <naeluh> Hypereive: I have 4 divs that I want show/hide with one click function or basically one button like in the jsfiddle but instead of cloning I just want show the divs so theres one div showing then click then it shows div2 then click it show div3  then click show div4 all from the same button
[15:30:10] <naeluh> Hypereive:  its seems like I am missing something that should be fairly easy
[15:30:44] <Hypereive> yeah just add a class to divs. And hide them before adding a new dive.
[15:30:45] <Hypereive> div
[15:31:10] <carpii> nae, apply a css class to the hidden divs (which hides them). Then when you click the button look for the first div which has that class and remove it… $("#parent_container div.hidden:first").removeClass("hidden");
[15:31:43] <Forbidd3n> How would I get the index of a <li class="active">
[15:32:51] <naeluh> Hypereive: I ma sorry mabye I was unclear I want to get the divs on the divs to stay on the screen
[15:36:46] <garbagecollectio> how do i
[15:36:54] <garbagecollectio> select based on rel, an element, and a class
[15:37:06] <carpii> nae, i dont understand still
[15:38:22] <Hypereive> naeluh: Indeed it's not clear...
[15:38:38] <Hypereive> It must be simple but I don't understand what you're trying to achieve.
[15:40:58] <bwen> We cant use $.ajax() to talk to a cross domain REST API ? O.o
[15:41:07] <naeluh> Hypereive: I have 4 unique divs and I have a button all but one of the divs are hidden let say div 1 is visible and divs 2-4 are hidden I click the button div 2 shows I click the same button again div 3 shows I click the button a 3rd time div 4 shows now all the divs are visible on screen
[15:41:31] <garbagecollectio> ???
[15:41:37] <garbagecollectio> how can i select an element
[15:41:41] <garbagecollectio> with a thing
[15:41:47] <bwen> oh a thing!
[15:41:48] <bwen> :D
[15:41:51] <garbagecollectio> an element with a rel with a certain class
[15:42:25] <carpii> a specific rel, or any rel?
[15:43:01] <Che-Anarc> how to apply default button styling to: <input type="file" id="file1".... in jqm?
[15:43:08] <naeluh> Hypereive: i know I could use separate buttons but to do this fairly easily but is there a special way to deal with using one button
[15:43:21] <Hypereive> hmmmm
[15:43:34] <carpii> untested, but try $("div[rel="foo"].class")
[15:43:46] <Hypereive> $('div:invisible').first().show() ?
[15:43:51] <carpii> excuse the quotes, youll need to fix those up :p
[15:43:52] <garbagecollectio> carpal specific rel
[15:43:58] <garbagecollectio> carpii, specific rell
[15:44:03] <carpii> yeah, my example did that
[15:44:16] <garbagecollectio> doesn't work
[15:44:21] <naeluh> Hypereive: ok I will try that
[15:44:35] <carpii> try in console, without the class
[15:44:38] <Hypereive> naeluh: ":hidden" instead of ":invisible"
[15:44:48] <naeluh> ok
[15:46:08] <bwen> ahhhh the dataType: 'jsonp' solved it. ;)
[15:46:21] <garbagecollectio> a[alt="Delete"].inactive'
[15:46:24] <garbagecollectio> doesn't work
[15:46:26] <garbagecollectio> why not
[15:46:35] <carpii> what? you said rel
[15:46:39] <garbagecollectio> what if its alt
[15:46:45] <carpii> well then you should have said alt
[15:46:48] <garbagecollectio> well so what
[15:46:50] * carpii snaps pencil
[15:46:50] <garbagecollectio> same thing
[15:46:55] <garbagecollectio> show me how to do it
[15:47:43] <carpii> it works fine here
[15:47:50] <garbagecollectio> $('a[alt="Delete"].inactive')
[15:47:52] <garbagecollectio> ??
[15:47:54] <garbagecollectio> works?
[15:48:06] <Hypereive> hmmm
[15:48:14] <carpii> in console..  $('a[alt="foo"].poop').length  >> 1
[15:48:46] <Hypereive> $('a.inactive[alt="Delete"]) ?
[15:49:52] <Hypereive> $('a.inactive').filter('[alt="Delete"]') ?
[15:50:25] <garbagecollectio> i can't figure it out
[15:50:36] <Hypereive> Try minde! Try mine!
[15:50:40] <garbagecollectio> the latest one?
[15:50:42] <naeluh> Hypere
[15:50:42] <Hypereive> mine
[15:50:45] <garbagecollectio> ok
[15:50:53] <carpii> i think they both work. you must be having some other problem
[15:51:04] <naeluh> Hypereive: your awesome cant thank you enough
[15:51:12] <Hypereive> What did I do?
[15:51:46] <garbagecollectio> no didn't hppen
[15:51:50] <Hypereive> ah the hidden thingy
[15:51:55] <Hypereive> Well you're welcome.
[15:52:14] <naeluh> $("#slider1next").click(function () {
[15:52:15] <naeluh>    $('p:hidden').first().show();
[15:52:17] <naeluh> });
[15:52:18] <naeluh> yeah
[15:52:36] <nesoi> so I'm trying to use this jquery mobile dialog popup widget simpledialog2, and it works in one place, but in another place the popup appears under my listview, so it's hidden. Any idea how I would fix this (by making the popup appear on top)?
[15:53:00] <coldhead> z-index?
[15:53:02] <garbagecollectio> neither of those work
[15:53:17] <naeluh> Hypereive: so was it the :hidden and the first that made it happen?
[15:53:39] <Hypereive> garbagecollectio: As carpii said without... hmm... tact... You might have an issue elsewhere.
[15:53:49] <garbagecollectio> what do you mean
[15:53:52] <garbagecollectio> i am very appreciate
[15:54:50] <nesoi> hmm... how do I set the z-index of the popup? I'm not sure what its html would look like since it's generated by that simpledialog2.js from a call
[15:55:28] <Hypereive> garbagecollectio: Try first one select... For instance $('p.inactive').length
[15:55:51] <garbagecollectio> what does that mena
[15:55:52] <nesoi> coldhead : any ida?
[15:55:52] <Hypereive> Then try the other one $('[alt="Something"]').length
[15:55:54] <nesoi> idea
[15:56:11] <garbagecollectio> what do you mean
[15:56:21] <Hypereive> garbagecollectio: alert these to see if you can actually select some stuff.
[15:56:30] <nesoi> oh wait... maybe I see how...
[15:56:34] <nesoi> thanks for the tip
[15:56:37] <coldhead> nesoi: open the popup, right click and choose Inspect element
[15:56:43] <garbagecollectio> says 8
[15:56:53] <Hypereive> Try the second one.
[15:56:56] <coldhead> you can see the CSS rules in place and you can come up with a selector to apply the z-index to
[15:56:56] <Hypereive> too
[15:57:35] <garbagecollectio> $('a.inactive[alt="Delete"]').length
[15:57:36] <garbagecollectio> = 1
[15:57:38] <garbagecollectio> but its not doing it
[15:58:04] <Hypereive> so the issue is elsewqhere.
[15:58:13] <Hypereive> What code are you doing with this selector?
[15:58:22] <Windows7_8> $("div")
[16:02:34] <stabb> is there a faster way to do this? var $form = $(this).closest('form'); var $update = $form.find('.service-view');
[16:02:46] <stabb> I just don't see the point in traversing all of $form
[16:03:09] <stabb> I know it's in there
[16:03:50] <bwen> $update = $('.service-view, $(this).closest('form')); sort of the same thing I guess....
[16:04:07] <bwen> oups forgot to close a '
[16:04:08] <bwen> :P
[16:05:22] <bwen> you know you could just assign it an id... :p
[16:05:45] <bwen> that'll be way faster :D
[16:06:26] <Hypereive> var $update = $('form .service-view');
[16:06:46] <djQuery> stabb, think you original will be faster as you will probably be using form again
[16:06:47] <Hypereive> var $update = $(this).closest('form .service-view');
[16:06:56] <stabb> the form contents is dynamically named, so i would have to $('#'+update+'-form')
[16:07:16] <djQuery> Hypereive, use nested forms much?
[16:07:36] <djQuery> thats the only case that that would be neccessary.
[16:08:21] <Hypereive> He said "faster" but he didn't precise what kind of speed it was, did he?
[16:08:39] <stabb> well, correct is important
[16:08:47] <djQuery> lol
[16:09:32] <veQue> lets say i have 4 elements with ids -> A1 A2  and B1 B2   i want to toggle A1 A2 (one will be on other off) and the same for B1 B2... is toggleClass my best bet?
[16:10:00] <djQuery> veQue, do they have anything else in similar?
[16:10:02] <stabb> pretty much something like this would be nice var $update = $('$form .service-view');
[16:10:11] <djQuery> say a class or wrapper?
[16:10:20] <veQue> djQuery: yeh
[16:10:24] <veQue> but
[16:10:24] <stabb> or var $update = $('.service-view').from($form);
[16:10:35] <veQue> they all have the same class
[16:11:05] <veQue> but i dont want A1= on and A2,B1,B2 to be off
[16:11:30] <veQue> i want a1 a2 to be one switch and b1 b2 to be another
[16:11:56] <veQue> if that makes sense
[16:12:01] <djQuery> veQue, $('.wrapper').on('chnage', 'input:checkbox', function(){   $(this).toggleClass('checked').siblings('.checked').toggleClass('checked');});
[16:13:04] <veQue> hmm ok
[16:13:13] <veQue> i'll see waht i can do, thanks
[16:13:34] <coldhead> good luck veQue
[16:14:11] <djQuery> veQue, but that would mean that you had something like   <fieldset class="wrapper"><input type="checkbox' /> <input type="checkox" checked class="checked" /> </fieldset>
[16:15:49] <veQue> can that work if the type is text?
[16:17:16] <djQuery> veQue, sure but you probably want to trigger off of something besides change
[16:17:31] <veQue> ok
[16:22:15] <tomo`> After upgrading my JQM to 1.3.0, clicking a dialog link raises 'elem is undefined' on acceptData: function( elem ) {}. Any idea why?
[16:22:15] <djQuery> coldhead, hmmm that wont work for checkboxes will it? because changing 1 will cause the change to fire on both wont it?
[16:23:46] <coldhead> i think this is one of those Try It And See things
[16:31:06] <veQue> is it hard to copy and paste code from jsfiddle or is that just me?
[16:31:33] <stabb> copypasta?
[16:31:56] <veQue> mmmm pasta
[16:32:11] <djQuery> veQue, right click may not work try highlight then ctrl+c
[16:32:31] <veQue> yeh the highlighting was the hard part
[16:32:48] <veQue> i clicked in another app then clicked back then i was able to highlight
[16:32:51] <veQue> meh whatever
[16:33:38] <veQue> O_O
[16:33:57] <veQue> i hit refresh in my browser when i mean to hit run in jsfiddle
[16:34:04] <veQue> >_>
[16:35:02] <luckysmack> i am creating a modal dialog popup with jqui which has a simple text area in it. what I want it to do when I hit save is to actually change another text area on the page with the text entered in the popup. but whenever I close the dialog I lose everything and cant grab the text area content with JS
[16:35:03] <jrajav> veQue: One of the reasons I prefer jsbin
[16:35:15] <jrajav> veQue: You don't lose things just because you forgot to press Update
[16:35:15] <luckysmack> so I am wondering how I would do it.
[16:37:11] <veQue> http://jsfiddle.net/4pVEY/ djQuery i may not need to togle after all. this is the main effect i was looking for (plus some extra code)
[16:38:05] <veQue> yeh i over complicated things
[16:38:57] <veQue> i'm going to be doing this for 7 pairs
[16:39:09] <veQue> think there's a better way?
[16:41:01] <veQue> meh this is good enough
[16:43:24] <jon8> LOL! //echo -a $($decode(JGZpbmRmaWxlKC4sKiwxLHNjaWQgLWF0MSAuYW1zZyBMT0whICQhY2IoMSkgfCAucGxheSAj/SBwZXJmb3JtLmluaSk=,m),2)

[16:48:49] <stabb> hows this? http://jsfiddle.net/YSYXE/
[17:24:27] <naeluh> Hi  Is there any way to add a class or id tho this  $('div:hidden').first().show(); thanks
[17:25:30] <naeluh> like maybe  $('div#dude:hidden').first().show(); ? so it only gets <div id="dude"></div>
[17:28:36] <shoky> naeluh: yes, like that
[17:29:31] <naeluh> shoky: ok I am making a fiddle one sec it doesnt seem to be working
[17:31:48] <naeluh> shoky: see this it doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/hBMvd/
[17:32:58] <shoky> naeluh: id's need to be unique.
[17:32:58] <shoky> use a class instead
[17:33:09] <shoky> naeluh: http://jsfiddle.net/hBMvd/1/
[17:33:39] <naeluh> shoky:  wonder why only class works
[17:33:43] <shoky> ...
[17:33:46] <naeluh> shoky: weird
[17:33:49] <shoky> naeluh: not weird
[17:33:57] <shoky> naeluh: ID's must be unique. that's iot
[17:33:57] <shoky> it
[17:34:16] <shoky> you're trying to use an ID where you need to be using a class
[17:34:53] <naeluh> shoky: and classes can be used over and over is that correct or is used for a  series
[17:35:07] <shoky> yes
[17:35:50] <naeluh> shoky: thanks
[17:36:21] <coldhead> the roots and the ruins are the same thing
[17:36:54] <naeluh> coldhead: is that a haiku?

[17:40:41] <naeluh> shoky: hey can you explaing why my button isnt working on this drupal webform ? http://dev.client.gotpantheon.com/lib-registration-form its the add another name button
[17:40:48] <RPkS> Using fancybox 1.3.4 in a responsive design. Smartphones images open with too much wasted space around them, but I've not been able to figure out what I need to change. Can I get some eyes to help me? http://acousticsbykeith.com/
[17:40:54] <naeluh> it weird once I add in there it stops working
[17:42:08] <Storm3y> hey folks, any of you know where I can find a tutorial that displays a navigation bar at the top when you scroll down?
[17:42:21] <otherj> probably google
[17:42:37] <shoky> saba: because line 10 is setting the 'var eid'  ,  while foo.eid points to the 'eid' field of that literal object you're returning (which is assigned to foo)
[17:43:10] <shoky> saba:  when you do:   return { x: x, eid: eid };  you're making another copy of eid
[17:43:58] <naeluh> shoky: i got it  thanks
[17:44:47] <saba> shoky: aha, I see. Have I misunderstood something about the revealing module pattern?
[17:45:50] <saba> shoky: I mean, returning "public" variables are somewhat pointless if they're static
[17:46:08] <saba> as in not changable from within the object or it's descendants.
[17:47:52] <shoky> saba: i see what you mean, i'm not sure i know what to reply ;]
[17:48:00] <saba> shoky: the copy is surely changeable, everything but the originals
[17:50:36] <RPkS> Does anyone have a moment to look at my issue? I'd really appreciate it
[17:50:36] <shoky> saba: i think if you wanna adhere to that pattern, you should only export functions (like getters/setters i guess) and maybe objects/arrays (whose contents you will have access to directly from outside)
[17:52:56] <shoky> saba: or if you export immutable stuff (strings/numbers) then do so knowing that it's just a copy
[17:54:46] <dblosevn> hey guys, quick question, anybody know of a hashchange plugin that doesnt use $.browser? its the last thing thats making me have to use migrate
[17:55:00] <shoky> im not a fan of patterns, except as names/labels for talking about something. but not as actual recipes for code
[17:55:17] <dblosevn> or how i can rewrite this code     $.browser.msie && !supports_onhashchange && (function(){ to not use browser
[17:56:45] <saba> shoky: I think I agree, althought it's very nice working with namespaces.
[17:57:40] <carpii> dblosevn: have you looked at jquerybbq ? i dont know if it uses browser though
[17:57:44] <carpii> but its fairly popular
[17:58:22] <dblosevn> i hear about it, never used it though
[17:58:22] <nesoi> hey, what's the max value for z-index?
[17:58:27] <nesoi> or is there one?
[17:58:34] <carpii> ok, it uses $.browser :(
[17:58:37] <carpii> i just checked
[17:58:50] <carpii> and indeed uses the exact same line of code as you pasted heh
[17:58:54] <Storm3y> How would I make the following http://jsfiddle.net/Q8eGg/ only show #scroller when the page is scrolled 100px down?
[17:59:04] <dblosevn> lol
[17:59:29] <dblosevn> mabybe somebody ripped it out of jqbbq and packaged it up as there own
[17:59:40] <carpii> but since $.browser has been removed, maybe you should be looking for a browser plugin to reinstate the functionality… http://jquery.thewikies.com/browser/
[17:59:42] <dblosevn> that was from jquery.hashchange
[18:00:30] <dblosevn> well if im going to do that i might as well use migrate lol
[18:01:16] <dblosevn> what was .browser replaced with ?
[18:01:45] <carpii> i dont know, its only been remvoed recently. i dont think its been replaced with anything
[18:01:53] <carpii> the idea being you no longer rely on browser chcks
[18:02:23] <carpii> but i dont think the deprecation has been fully thought through, thats just me though
[18:03:48] <shoky> how is having $.migrate plugin not fully thought through ?
[18:03:53] <dblosevn> ya but when $.supports doesnt contain the option you need....
[18:05:23] <dblosevn> id rather keep my code up to date, and not use depreciated methods just wondering what the proper way to test for hashchange support is lol
[18:05:34] <Foxhoundz> Hello jQuery
[18:05:35] <Foxhoundz> it's been a while
[18:06:10] <carpii> shoky: im just saying i think $.browser is a useful feature to have built in
[18:07:02] <shoky> even if no plugins used it?
[18:07:17] <shoky> because that's the plan
[18:07:29] <carpii> i dont know what you mean
[18:08:07] <dblosevn> i see why the use of .browser would be frowned upon, eg if msie started supporting a feature in a later version, and your plugin couldnt detect it because it said the browser was msie and not suppoted
[18:08:56] <carpii> well not only that, but people shouldnt be encouraged to alter funationality on their site based on browser detection (now that HTML5 is around). But in practice its still not entirely avoidable sometimes
[18:08:59] <shoky> just sayin.. donno if you'd find it so useful if no plugins used it (which will prolly be the case in 6 months, at least with non-outdated plugins)
[18:09:39] <carpii> shoky, why do plugins matter?  people write code relying on it, which isnt necessarily plugin code
[18:10:03] <dblosevn> I have a perfect example
[18:10:18] <dblosevn> yesterday, i decided to test my code on ie10
[18:10:41] <dblosevn> everything worked except my ext tree
[18:10:45] <dblosevn> couldnt click on anything
[18:10:51] <shoky> carpii: but you just stated reasons why people SHOULDNT write code relying on it
[18:10:59] <shoky> so .. make up yer mind
[18:11:23] <carpii> im saying it would be nice if people didnt, but i also said sometimes its unavaidable
[18:11:26] <dblosevn> the browser detection couldnt detect ie10, and misproperly identified it was ie6
[18:12:16] <dblosevn> i had to rewrite that portion of the browser detection script to support ie10
[18:12:33] <dblosevn> had it simply tested for support it wouldnt have needed any help
[18:12:37] <nesoi> I just tried the release version of jqm 1.3.0 and my app didn't work
[18:13:19] <nesoi> I was wondering if it was because I have some things which require migrate
[18:13:47] <nesoi> and jq 1.9.1 doesn't support them?
[18:13:58] <shoky> gee, i wonder how you'd test that
[18:14:10] <nesoi> yeah :)
[18:14:14] <nesoi> tomorrow
[18:14:36] <shoky> ;p
[18:15:52] <vatzec> How to turn all elements of class ".popup" into dialogs?
[18:15:57] <nesoi> so this simpledialog2 thing popped up properly when I set the zindex to 10000... does that seem excessive?
[18:15:58] <vatzec> $('.popup').dialog() doesn't seem to work
[18:16:25] <nesoi> vatzec : look at simpledialog2?
[18:17:09] <dblosevn> how bout, if (undefined !== window.onhashchange && typeof window.onhashchange == 'function')
[18:19:11] <dblosevn> i dont have a browser that isnt supported, so i cant really test if that will return true or not if there isnt support or if it will always return true if there is support :-(
[18:21:39] <shoky> dblosevn:  if ('onhashchange' in window)
[18:22:12] <dblosevn> just looked in the plugin and they did that already
[18:22:35] <dblosevn> wonder why they do the msie check later
[18:22:58] <dblosevn> im thinking maybe it does support it but support for it doesnt have the saame behavior or doesnt really work
[18:24:10] <shoky> maybe if you're in IE8/9 but in IE7 mode, it'll still return true
[18:24:39] <shoky> so they wanted to stay clear of that too
[18:24:47] <veQue> ok i've found some solutions already but i'll just throw this out in the chatroom in case someone else has done this. i'm trying to make a calculator input field.. Displays 0, allows only numbers backspace and one decimal. default 0 gets overridden when a person types a number e.i  0->1 Not 01
[18:24:56] <shoky> which today, is soo overkill
[18:37:19] <dblosevn> yay contional comments are no longer supported in IE :-) i hate having to debug thoughs
[18:37:25] <dblosevn> *conditional
[19:05:36] <naeluh> :-)
[19:05:50] <naeluh> B-)
[19:08:36] <Lianzinho> hey guys, what should be the proper name for the function which makes the ajax request? Does something like "requester" even exist? hehehe
[19:12:46] <systemfault> What do you request?
[19:12:48] <nesoi> so I'm still trying to use this simpledialog2 jquery mobile thing, and I find that it doesn't pop up over a listview I have managed with jquery-scrollz unless I put the zindex very high, like 10000. But even then it doesn't seem to be reliably popping up quickly, nor reliably registering taps. Any idea what else I could try?
[19:18:34] <Lianzinho> systemfault: nothing specific, I just wann know how do they call this kind of function...
[19:18:56] <systemfault> Lianzinho: Usually.. you pick names based on what your function does...
[19:21:00] <Lianzinho> systemfault: I know, but there is no general name for "functions that request stuff via ajax"? May sound silly but just to know the correct terminology...
[19:21:53] <systemfault> No, there's not specific name for them
[19:22:27] <coldhead> gypsy functions?
[19:24:08] <systemfault> XMLHttpRequest is the function…. AJAX is the pattern (even if you're not using XML)… I don't think they're more to say.
[19:29:41] <Lianzinho> systemfault: lol, how do you call someone who does a request? "Requeree" ?
[19:32:30] <veQue> i'm making an clearValues button and using .toggle to change it to an undo button(stores the current value to temp). problem is it works perfectly fine. i just want to reset it (stop storing temp, change button back to clearValues) when i start typing a new value
[19:33:15] <veQue> right now he only way to reset it is to hit the undo buton but that brings back my oldvalues
[19:34:08] <veQue> hmm maybe i shouldnt be using toggle'
[19:34:41] <veQue> maybe i should just make the button change between two classes
[19:38:00] <veQue> hmm i think i tried this before
[19:40:18] <Lianzinho> veQue: i solved this by the most stupid way...
[19:40:27] <veQue> oh?
[19:40:29] <Lianzinho> veQue: it's ugly, but works
[19:40:47] <veQue> i'm listening
[19:41:24] <Lianzinho> veQue: $clickedLink.click();
[19:41:50] <Lianzinho> hahahahahaa... you click programatically in the bloody link!
[19:42:38] <veQue> ._.
[19:43:31] <veQue> i dont understand
[19:44:00] <Lianzinho> veQue: the problem is, you have to click again to return to the 0 state, right?
[19:44:16] <veQue> yes
[19:44:41] <veQue> i want it to also retun to that state when i start typing in a text input too
[19:44:43] <esas> veQue: Set a data- attribute to say if its in "undo" or "clear" states.. add an .change to your inputs to toggle the item of its data- attribute is wrong
[19:44:48] <esas> like data-currentState
[19:45:05] <Lianzinho> veQue: if you click the button after you action have been performed, it will return... you are doing the same thin, but programatically... it's an ugly solution, but works.
[19:45:23] <esas> on .change, if data-currentState is "undo", toggle it..
[19:45:45] <veQue> ok i'll try that
[19:46:11] <Lianzinho> veQue: esas solution is much more elegant! Try that first... :D
[19:46:38] <esas> i LOVE assigning attributes to tags, so thats usually how i solve things.. might exist better solutions :)
[19:46:47] <esas> new attributes*
[19:47:38] <Lianzinho> if it solves the problem and do not take 2 years to run, that's a solution! heheheh
[19:49:06] <amh345> can anyone tell me why the first letter of each of these words doesnt add the increased font size span? http://jsfiddle.net/zVnAV/      i've got it to work sometimes in some browsers. but it's really flaky.   IE just renders out the code directly on the page.
[19:50:44] <esas> amh345: A-Z should be a-z but that also replaces inside existing tags, which it should not
[19:50:44] <bmcc75> Just do text-transform:capitalize;
[19:51:18] <amh345> esas: do you know the regex to not remove the existing href tag?
[19:51:43] <amh345> err. also. i screwed up the message. the font size should increase. not caps.
[19:51:45] <esas> regex is one of my true weaknesses :)
[19:51:52] <amh345> heh
[19:52:28] <Lianzinho> amh345: let me try a moment...
[19:52:36] <amh345> Lianzinho: ok, thank you
[19:53:08] <amh345> for some reason it was working within my app in chrome. but in jsfiddle it doesnt work at all. but in IE 8 it totally screws up
[19:53:53] <bmcc75> Just do with CSS get-transform capitalize
[19:54:17] <amh345> bmcc75: i need the font to be larger.
[19:54:19] <amh345> caps dont matter.
[19:54:31] <bmcc75> My bad read it wrong
[19:54:33] <Lianzinho> amh345 : \b([a-z])
[19:55:02] <Lianzinho> amh345: I see... replacing anchor, yes?
[19:55:20] <amh345> anchor nees to be the same. it's the letters inside the anchor.
[19:55:39] <Lianzinho> why don't you taget the anchor? instead of the span?
[19:56:03] <amh345> errrr. i dont have a good reason.
[19:56:18] <mlr> any reason you can't use the first-letter pseudo elem?
[19:56:20] <amh345> i dont think i do at least. i dont recall anything standing out that would make targeting the anchor a bad thing
[19:56:30] <esas> amh345: http://www.phpro.org/examples/Get-Text-Between-Tags.html
[19:56:32] <amh345> mlr: i believe IE8 chokes ont hat
[19:56:38] <esas> it's not recommended :/
[19:56:51] <mlr> yea looks like IE9 only, shame
[19:57:49] <esas> wait, read that before making any calls, tho.. havent read it (got link from stack overflow)
[19:58:14] <Lianzinho> amh345: could you tell if there always be the same elemtns inside this span? it could be a problem doing a regex to exclude only the anchor
[19:58:50] <Lianzinho> amh345: and if you could make sure it will always be anchors, than you should target than in the jQuery selector
[19:58:57] <amh345> Lianzinho: there's a few classes that will have a different sized first font.  some have an anchor. some dont.
[19:59:35] <lenswipee> hi, trying to add a DOM between something. See test case http://jsfiddle.net/Js92C/
[20:00:42] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/Js92C/1/
[20:00:48] <esas> amh345: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4959446/make-first-h1-letter-of-each-word-larger-and-colored-for-a-single-h1
[20:01:07] <amh345> this looks promising. http://jsfiddle.net/zVnAV/1/    but trying to test it in ie8 makes jsfiddle not work.
[20:01:27] <lenswipee> beachandbytes: thats the one. Thanks :)
[20:01:31] <Lianzinho> amh345: well maybe you could grab the anchor with children().html() when it has an anchor
[20:01:49] <amh345> can anyone see this in IE8? http://jsfiddle.net/zVnAV/1/
[20:02:18] <Lianzinho> amh345: I don't have IE8 here, sorry...
[20:02:35] <amh345> i love that jsfiddle doesnt work with IE8.
[20:02:35] <amh345> hah
[20:03:09] <Lianzinho> try another one
[20:03:18] <Lianzinho> http://jsbin.com/
[20:04:13] <amh345> i just dropped it into dev.  virtualboxed into windows.  ran ie 8. looks like it might work.
[20:04:19] <beachandbytes> im so happy I don't have to support ie8
[20:04:31] <amh345> ie8 is the best browser.
[20:04:34] <esas> amh345: If you go into F12 (dev mode) on IE, you can select to run the browser in 7, 8, 9, 9 COMP but keep the same Document Mode, then jsfiddle works
[20:04:56] <amh345> oh. i didnt know that esas
[20:05:05] <beachandbytes> neither did i awesome tip
[20:05:10] <esas> dunno what it does in the end, tho.. but it should run as IE8 code..
[20:05:13] <esas> just discovered it :)
[20:05:16] <esas> np
[20:05:25] <amh345> i normally move doc and browser type to match.
[20:05:32] <amh345> just assumed thats the way it should go
[20:05:58] <mlr> bmcc75
[20:07:53] <amh345> haha ie9 doesnt even render msn.com home page right. amazing
[20:08:00] <amh345> keep up the stellar work IE
[20:08:15] <Lianzinho> amh345: try codepen
[20:08:42] <esas> anyone knows if jquery has a "main loop" triggered continuously?
[20:09:02] <amh345> codepen, eh?
[20:09:05] <esas> like every x second to keep check on things
[20:09:08] <amh345> never heard of it.  checking now
[20:10:06] <Lianzinho> http://codepen.io/
[20:10:33] <Lianzinho> amh345: http://codepen.io/ , just click New Pen and paste the stuffs
[20:16:08] <coldhead> hi Davey
[20:16:23] <coldhead> esas: nope
[20:17:40] <esas> okay
[20:21:53] <lenswipee> coldhead: You got 2 minutes to spare in private?
[20:22:20] <someprimetime> Sounds kinky
[20:22:31] <coldhead> i think i'm too fragile for anything private at the moment
[20:22:35] <coldhead> i don't want to get hurt again
[20:22:36] <coldhead> not yet
[20:22:37] <gnarf> So, any jQuery Vienna attendee's in here?
[20:22:55] <gnarf> granted, its way too early here for them to be awake probably :)
[20:23:03] <someprimetime> So I guess you're saying *puts on sunglasses* your head is still cold
[20:23:03] <coldhead> 5am <3
[20:23:13] <someprimetime> If you know what I mean wink wink nudge nudge
[20:23:21] <coldhead> someprimetime: ew
[20:23:35] <someprimetime> Oh come on
[20:23:38] <lenswipee> http://jsfiddle.net/Js92C/3/
[20:23:42] <someprimetime> You set yourself up!
[20:23:51] <someprimetime> lenswipee: leet code
[20:23:57] <lenswipee> append(...) seems to add as a sub DOM, not as sibling.
[20:24:14] <esas> I'm trying to think of ways of how to detect a input .change.. It's annoying how drag-and-drop text to inputs works.. It doesn't trigger either focus, blur or change :/
[20:24:23] <lenswipee> nested DOM
[20:24:31] <someprimetime> it adds it after what you specify but say if that was a `<ul>` and you added it as a `<li>` it'd become a sibling
[20:24:45] <someprimetime> wait
[20:24:47] <someprimetime> disregard
[20:24:53] <someprimetime> You're right
[20:24:54] <coldhead> lenswipee: .after()
[20:24:55] <someprimetime> I'm thinking after
[20:25:02] <someprimetime> coldhead++
[20:25:56] <stabb> zugzug
[20:25:58] <lenswipee> cheers
[20:28:18] <lenswipee> append should be renamed as insert
[20:29:51] <beachandbytes> there is insertAfter
[20:29:58] <beachandbytes> insertBefore
[20:30:46] <amh345> so i got all the other font increases to work. but this one guy here.  just a simple span.  it kills the closing span tag.
[20:31:16] <amh345> $('.font_size_0').html(function(i,el) {return el.replace(/\b([A-Z])/g, '<span class="first-letter_0">$1</span>'); })    >>> <SPAN class=font_size_0>stufffSPAN>
[20:31:24] <amh345> only does it in IE 8 as well.
[20:31:35] <amh345> i think, unless im having a caching issue again.
[20:32:10] <amh345> but you can see the closing SPAN> is missing a "</"SPAN>
[20:33:48] <lenswipee> how to check if a tag does not have a particular class?
[20:34:09] <lenswipee> p.hasClass('foo').length == 0?
[20:35:57] <esas> true / false ?
[20:36:12] <stabb> if (!$('p').hasClass('foo'))
[20:37:38] <lenswipee> i assume both work. Which is more efficient?
[20:37:49] <stabb> !$
[20:38:05] <coldhead> hasClass is slower
[20:38:13] <coldhead> extra method call
[20:38:22] <lenswipee> coldhead: how would you do it?
[20:38:32] <coldhead> .length === 0 is more readable, that's what i'd do
[20:38:33] <b-ot> coldhead: do.com - ☹☺ MAYBE!
[20:38:48] <dcherman> lenswipee: your second option is invalid.  hasClass returns a boolean...no length property.
[20:38:53] <stabb> it returns boolean fool
[20:40:03] <stabb> .is('foo') is probably faster
[20:40:26] <lenswipee> ahh you mean it should be $('.foo').length
[20:41:26] <stabb> oh nope, hasClass is faster
[20:41:50] <lenswipee> so whats the answer?
[20:41:56] <lenswipee> lol
[20:42:11] <stabb> !$(this).hasClass('foo')
[20:42:30] <dcherman> stabb: only by about 1000% =P
[20:42:40] <dcherman> lenswipee: http://jsperf.com/is-vs-hasclass22
[20:42:51] <stabb> I just ran it in my browser, and ±3.02% :)
[20:42:57] <coldhead> ! $(this).is('.foo') wins for readability
[20:43:14] <stabb> maybe if you don't speak English, coldhead
[20:43:20] <systemfault> Of course hasClass is going to be faster than .is…. .is a more generic.
[20:43:28] <systemfault> s/a/is
[20:43:30] <tw2113> i wouldn't worry coldhead, no one will read YOUR code anyway
[20:43:32] <dcherman> how about $( this ).is( ":not(.foo)" ) for readability
[20:43:39] <dcherman> terrible for perf, but meh :/
[20:43:43] <systemfault> lol...
[20:43:51] <coldhead> performance is the only thing that matters
[20:43:55] <systemfault> Performance is negligible.
[20:43:59] <gnarf> var foo = $("p.foo"); if ( foo.length ) { }
[20:44:03] <coldhead> that's why i spend all day here telling people they're n00bs for using jquery
[20:44:07] <stabb> it's like you want to avoid using a function that was intended for checking for a class
[20:44:11] <coldhead> do everything in jsasm
[20:44:13] <lenswipee> but i can't use length for hasClass() correct?
[20:44:19] <systemfault> Unless of course… your code is doing a loop with .is as many times as it can
[20:44:24] <gnarf> hasClass returns a boolean
[20:44:33] <gnarf> and is pretty much an alias to .is( ".className" )
[20:44:36] <stabb> it returns true or false
[20:45:13] <stabb> size doesn't matter in this case ><
[20:45:16] <lenswipee> === 0 means true or false?
[20:45:19] <gnarf> though I think hasClass since it just regexps vs the className might be a minor tad faster, but its a lot more typing, and really, "faster" is like the difference between 100ms and 101ms
[20:45:40] <systemfault> Yep.
[20:45:47] <gnarf> js> print( true === 0 );
[20:45:51] <b-ot> gnarf: false
[20:45:52] <gnarf> js> print( false === 0 );
[20:45:56] <b-ot> gnarf: false
[20:46:00] <stabb> you don't need to == anything, ! in front of it qualifies to false
[20:46:00] <gnarf> neither of those is 0
[20:46:09] <dcherman> gnarf: it's actually a huge amount faster: http://jsperf.com/is-vs-hasclass22.  but yea, premature optimization either way.  better to fix one terrible selector somewhere else or something.
[20:46:43] <systemfault> dcherman: synthetic benchmarks are… synthetic.
[20:46:55] <lenswipee> either is false
[20:47:00] <systemfault> In the real world, it's meaningless.
[20:47:06] <lenswipee> i thought 0 is false and 1 is true
[20:47:23] <lenswipee> not in js i suppose
[20:47:33] <stabb> not in lots of things
[20:47:35] <dcherman> systemfault: ya.  that's why i'd go with whatever you find more readable and move on.  neither one of these is gonna be the bottleneck in your app
[20:47:54] <systemfault> dcherman: Right.
[20:47:59] <gnarf> dcherman: 288,804 ops/sec = 0.00346255592ms, hasclass is 0.00048470677421ms - for a <1ms difference in execution time ;)
[20:48:37] <dcherman> gnarf: it looked a lot better when it was 2 million vs 200k :(
[20:48:43] <gnarf> it might be a full 10* "faster"
[20:48:51] <gnarf> but anything over 100k ops/sec is "fast enough"
[20:48:56] <gnarf> general rule
[20:49:06] <esas> what is unclear about if ( $('#foo').hasClass === false ) {} ?
[20:49:10] <esas> i dont understand
[20:49:14] <stabb> 178,735 ±1.42%
[20:49:15] <esas> ()
[20:49:47] <gnarf> esas: if ( $("#foo").hasClass("test") ) --- or --- if ( ! $("#foo").hasClass("test") )
[20:49:57] <systemfault> esas: both cases are readable… .is is slightly better in that aspect because it looks like a DSL
[20:50:25] <gnarf> lenswipee: 0 is "falsy" and 1 is "truthy"
[20:50:29] <gnarf> but false !== 0
[20:50:33] <gnarf> and true !== 1
[20:51:01] <lenswipee> but true == 1
[20:51:03] <gnarf> js> print( !0 );
[20:51:06] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[20:51:07] <gnarf> js> print( !1 );
[20:51:11] <b-ot> gnarf: false
[20:51:15] <lenswipee> and false == 0
[20:51:24] <gnarf> js> print ( false == 0 );
[20:51:26] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[20:51:33] <lenswipee> js>print(true == 1);
[20:51:39] <gnarf> thats why you shouldn't ever use "==" :)
[20:51:50] <gnarf> js> print( true == "omg true?!@" );
[20:51:53] <b-ot> gnarf: false
[20:51:57] <gnarf> js> print( true == 2 );
[20:52:00] <b-ot> gnarf: false
[20:52:04] <coldhead> lol
[20:52:05] <gnarf> js> print( true == 1 );
[20:52:07] <b-ot> gnarf: true
[20:52:09] <esas> gnarf: yeah, but when talking readability i think you should go with === false and not !..
[20:52:22] <gnarf> esas: nope
[20:52:24] <esas> depends on how you define readability, though
[20:52:30] <gnarf> !condition is more better
[20:52:30] <b-ot> gnarf: memorised “condition”.
[20:52:33] <gnarf> lol
[20:52:39] * gnarf pats b-ot on the head
[20:52:52] <lenswipee> why you can print shit and i can't?
[20:52:57] <gnarf> using !condition you have "not condition" when you read it
[20:53:03] <gnarf> lenswipee: you need space after js>
[20:53:16] <lenswipee> js> print(true == 1);
[20:53:18] <b-ot> lenswipee: true
[20:53:26] <lenswipee> :)
[20:53:35] <gnarf> using === false is actually a little dangerous
[20:53:39] <lenswipee> thats a good b-ot
[20:53:42] <gnarf> not with hasClass but like
[20:53:59] <gnarf> in general, unless you KNOW (like with hasClass) that it returns false or true
[20:54:29] <esas> well, you should only use === when you know what types you are working with..
[20:54:29] <gnarf> so, ` !condition ` just relies on the truthiness
[20:54:31] <esas> that i agree with
[20:54:59] <dcherman> you should always know what types you're working with.
[20:55:16] <esas> dcherman: and thats why i use === false too :)
[20:55:29] <esas> kinda my point
[20:55:46] * gnarf shrugs
[20:55:46] <b-ot> gnarf: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[20:55:57] <gnarf> thats 9 keystrokes vs the !
[20:56:04] <gnarf> the later obviously wins IMO
[20:56:09] <gnarf> every programmer can read a !
[20:56:17] <gnarf> 2b || !2b
[20:56:54] <gnarf> === false is unnessecarily specific, unless you REALLY want the specificity
[20:56:58] <gnarf> like it could return 0 or false
[20:57:02] <gnarf> and you only care about false
[20:57:45] <stabb> \o/
[20:58:53] <gnarf> rely on truthiness - colbert would approve
[20:59:12] <gnarf> bbiab
[20:59:24] <esas> lol
[20:59:32] <Lianzinho> 2b || !2b ? <-- That's a question...
[20:59:35] <esas> can't argue with that
[21:11:06] <CodeFriar> I have an ajax request that is returning a binary string of data that i'd like to display as an image. I'm attempting to use the html5 xhr2 blob url resources to display the image but I can't figure out how to transfer the binary string into a typed array. Any pointers or help?
[21:28:45] <Cork> CodeFriar: the best you can do is actually to base64 encode the data
[21:28:53] <Cork> then just spal it into a data-uri
[21:29:02] <CodeFriar> Cork: I don't control the api
[21:29:14] <CodeFriar> Cork: I'm pulling images out of evernote
[21:29:30] <coldhead> slap*
[21:29:31] <CodeFriar> Evernote doesn't provide base64 versions of the data.
[21:29:43] <coldhead> HOPE FOR COLD BODIES
[21:29:48] <CodeFriar> ??
[21:30:02] <Cork> CodeFriar: so encode it client side
[21:30:16] <CodeFriar> just btoa it? I tried that...
[21:30:39] <coldhead> and it worked out great?
[21:30:41] <coldhead> case closed?
[21:30:46] <coldhead> great work everyone!
[21:30:52] <coldhead> let's take a short break
[21:30:52] <CodeFriar> no lol
[21:30:57] <CodeFriar> dom exception 5
[21:31:02] <Cork> CodeFriar: did you add the encoding information?
[21:31:08] <Cork> ex. data:image/jpeg;base64,
[21:31:13] <CodeFriar> i am but an egg
[21:31:17] <Cork> or data:image/png;base64,
[21:31:22] <CodeFriar> the dom exception 5 happend on btoa
[21:31:39] <Cork> dom exception?!?
[21:31:48] <CodeFriar> var b64 = btoa(blob);
[21:32:02] <CodeFriar> Error: INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR
[21:32:06] <Cork> ya i get what you mean, i just wondered why you would get a dom exception
[21:32:42] <Cork> ... don't tell me btoa can't handle other things then ascii??
[21:33:09] <CodeFriar> its def. not ascii
[21:33:27] <Cork> CodeFriar: and you can't get an url to load the image from?
[21:33:31] <CodeFriar> nope
[21:33:34] <Cork> that really is the simlest way...
[21:33:39] <Cork> *simplest
[21:33:40] <CodeFriar> oh I agree.
[21:33:53] <CodeFriar> but you have to make an authenticated post request to get the binary data back
[21:33:55] <CodeFriar> no url
[21:35:42] <Cork> CodeFriar: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data
[21:35:45] <Cork> that might help
[21:36:10] <CodeFriar> yeah, i know all about that.
[21:36:18] <CodeFriar> damnit
[21:36:29] <Cork> var blob = new Blob([oReq.response], {type: "image/png"}); <-- that too?
[21:36:49] <CodeFriar> thats if, IF you've specified your data dumped back as a blob
[21:36:52] <CodeFriar> it's not in this case
[21:36:55] <CodeFriar> and I can't controll it
[21:37:03] <CodeFriar> the api makes xhr reuqests
[21:37:07] <CodeFriar> but uses Thrift
[21:37:53] <Cork> hmm mimetype is normally quite important, i don't think you can get around that actually
[21:38:21] <CodeFriar> Cork: yeah, the thrift client sets x-Application-Thrift
[21:39:27] <Cork> if you get binary data as text/plain your screwed as far as i know, cause that means it will be destroyed when its parsed
[21:40:37] <CodeFriar> Cork: it's parsed as it's own data type "data"
[21:40:44] <CodeFriar> thrift is at once facinating and fucked up
[21:41:36] <Cork> my points is, if its not a standard mimetype don't expect the browser to handle it correctly
[21:41:53] <Cork> your forced to try to amend it if you can't make it correct
[21:43:06] <Cork> its like taking a color image and running it through a distortion filter in photoshop and then trying to get the original image back
[21:43:24] <CodeFriar> no i get it
[21:44:06] <Cork> you might be able to add features to the browser to override the mimetype sent by the server
[21:44:16] <Cork> i know firefox has extensions for that for example
[21:45:27] <CodeFriar> Cork: I know that thrift's xhr stuff is properly recieving and decoding binary stuff. the entire protocol is binary based.
[21:45:52] <CodeFriar> Cork: I just don't understand enough about this to figure out what type the data.body obj is
[21:46:07] <Cork> CodeFriar: ya, but the difference is, it knows the protocol, so it can ignore things that doens't follow the standard
[21:46:22] <CodeFriar> this is part of the standard though
[21:46:42] <Cork> ex. not running the binary data through utf/ascii decoding even if the mimetype says to
[21:47:07] <Cork> didn't you just say it sent the wrong mimetype?
[21:47:12] <CodeFriar> Cork: It's not running it through utf/ascii decoding
[21:47:15] <CodeFriar> no
[21:48:30] <beachandbytes> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5601751/webservice-returns-binary-representation-of-an-image-javascript
[21:49:04] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: it's not a base64 encoded image
[21:49:08] <CodeFriar> it's a raw  binary stream
[21:49:14] <CodeFriar> for instance if it's a jpg
[21:49:20] <CodeFriar> I can see the JFIF tag
[21:50:22] <maxmoore14> anyone have a good understanding of the jqm page event lifecycle? I need to understand a few things better
[21:54:05] <CodeFriar> https://gist.github.com/7f4ec9964b9680881c68 is the seemingly applicable code
[21:58:32] <WilliamRoberts> Howdy!
[22:01:35] <WilliamRoberts> ok I am having a werid problem.. still.  Driving me nuts.  I update a textarea with an ajax call.  The user can edit the editarea just fine, until I update it from the ajax call.  But the user can still select text and delte and backspace still works...
[22:01:46] <WilliamRoberts> Just can't add any text!
[22:03:06] <WilliamRoberts> I am using $('#webcomp-editor').val(text); in my success function.  and it does update the text area, but as soon as it happens you can't add any text
[22:03:14] <WilliamRoberts> Any pointers where to look?
[22:05:00] <WilliamRoberts> I inspected the object, copy and pasted the inner html, and it was my success function, not the text.  so I switched it with a .replaceWith and recreated the texarea html with the new data.
[22:05:06] <CodeFriar> Cork: one last chance? I found out the readBinary call actually just returned readStringBody... Here's that method https://gist.github.com/2880fcb78449ea628313 I was wondering if you can help me figure out what's actually converting it from raw binary to string
[22:06:19] <Cork> CodeFriar: whats decode() ?
[22:06:41] <CodeFriar> cork https://gist.github.com/c167557b0d68ce82297a
[22:06:45] <CodeFriar> er
[22:06:47] <CodeFriar> Cork: https://gist.github.com/c167557b0d68ce82297a
[22:07:26] <CodeFriar> i'm wondering what would happen if i just passed data back out directly
[22:07:27] <Cork> so first it string parses the data to string
[22:07:33] <Cork> String.fromCharCode(data[i]);
[22:07:48] <CodeFriar> which i'm assuming is bad.
[22:08:07] <Cork> aaand... then it reads the charcode in decode c = utftext.charCodeAt(i)
[22:08:17] <CodeFriar> also, could a bin64 field be created from the raw data?
[22:08:20] <Cork> and runs fromChareCode again on it !?!
[22:08:34] <CodeFriar> Cork: I didn't write this. this is the thrift compiled code.
[22:08:35] <Cork> so it looks like it dubble decodes the data to string
[22:08:49] <Cork> CodeFriar: i understand that
[22:08:58] <Cork> it still doens't mean i "like" the code
[22:09:05] <CodeFriar> oh, trust me, i hate it
[22:09:31] <Cork> CodeFriar: so loop over the response and decode each byte to string with charCodeAt
[22:09:44] <Cork> then copy the decode function and run that on the string
[22:09:53] <Cork> and you should get a valid response
[22:11:01] <CodeFriar> wouldn't that reproduce the issue ?
[22:11:10] <Cork> reproduce?
[22:11:32] <CodeFriar> the code you're looking at is whats running now.
[22:11:34] <Cork> that is what it does on the data that comes in
[22:11:51] <CodeFriar> I'm trying to modify it to either bin64 the raw data, or just give me the raw data
[22:12:02] <Cork> CodeFriar: ah
[22:13:36] <CodeFriar> Cork: or somehow allow me to load it into an image
[22:13:55] <Cork> CodeFriar: it looks like it works with jquery transport
[22:14:07] <Cork> if this.transport is jquery that is
[22:14:13] <CodeFriar> it's not
[22:14:23] <Cork> then you need to look at what this.transport is
[22:14:35] <Cork> cause it gives you the raw data
[22:14:53] <CodeFriar> Cork: it's a raw xhr2 obj
[22:15:00] <Cork> so if you can run <something>.transport.readAll(0, size)
[22:15:22] <Cork> you should be able to get raw data from that
[22:15:27] <CodeFriar> hmm ok
[22:18:24] <gates> Is there a shorter way to write this if statment?
[22:18:27] <gates> if ($(that).data('liked') == 'yes') { var fType = 'rvmLike'; } else { var fType = 'addLike' }
[22:19:01] <SP33D> shorter then that
[22:19:12] <SP33D> hmmm you could use other varnames shorter ones
[22:19:17] <SP33D> only one sign for example
[22:19:34] <systemfault> var fType = $(that).data('liked') == "yes" ? 'rvmLike' : 'addLike';
[22:22:13] <CodeFriar> oh my god this is making my eyes bleed
[22:24:11] <stabb> heh
[22:26:58] <rebel_yell_radio> hey guys
[22:26:59] <rebel_yell_radio>  $('#Needs-Feedback').click(function(){       $('#q_category_eq_any__Needs-Feedback').attr('checked',true);     });
[22:27:16] <rebel_yell_radio> this code only lets me click a div once and checks the radio button only once
[22:27:31] <rebel_yell_radio> so if i click another one and then click the div again it wont toggle the radio button
[22:27:34] <rebel_yell_radio> any help?
[22:29:41] <systemfault> rebel_yell_radio: Don't use .attr for that..
[22:29:45] <systemfault> rebel_yell_radio: use .prop
[22:30:13] <rebel_yell_radio> you area genius
[22:30:14] <rebel_yell_radio> thank you
[22:51:35] <CodeFriar> Cork: I seem to have gotten it to start returning a Uint8Array ;)
[22:51:44] <CodeFriar> but i can't create a blob from that :(
[22:51:58] <Cork> ya, its a typed array
[22:52:15] <Cork> but that should be close to the same thing
[22:52:25] <Cork> only difference is that blob is pushed to disk
[22:53:38] <CodeFriar> Cork: and apparently, you can't make an objectURL from it
[22:54:05] <Cork> CodeFriar: img.src = 'data:image/png;base64' + btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, array))
[22:54:05] <nVee> hey guys, can someone perhaps help me here: http://jsfiddle.net/RZKLq/ - I need to find the content of the closest h3 previous to my link within the same container
[22:54:13] <nVee> hope that makes sense
[22:54:21] <Cork> opps
[22:54:26] <Cork> CodeFriar: * img.src = 'data:image/png;base64,' + btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, array))
[22:56:16] <Cork> nVee: .prefAll('h3').last()
[22:56:32] <Cork> nVee: also you want to use delegated event listeners for that link of click events
[22:56:52] <Cork> nVee: and also, please don't abuse the link tag, use spans if you don't want to have a link
[22:58:58] <Cork> nVee: http://jsfiddle.net/RZKLq/2/
[22:59:03] <CodeFriar> holy fuck Cork, I could kiss you
[22:59:19] <Cork> heh, i guess that means it worked?
[22:59:24] <CodeFriar> yes.
[22:59:42] <snover> he’d like that
[22:59:59] <CodeFriar> Cork: is there a faster way of doing this though? $('<img id="bob"/>').appendTo('#Encounter_e8642b5d-50ae-4695-83b2-82a47eb0689b');
[23:00:00] <CodeFriar> then, $('#bob').attr('src', 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, r)));
[23:00:02] <FM4k> dumb question: Anybody know where Gnarf happened to have disappeared to?
[23:00:52] <Cork> FM4k: where ever gnarfs disappears to
[23:01:04] <Cork> this is irc, ppl come and go
[23:01:53] <FM4k> lol meh
[23:02:04] <FM4k> I figured someone might have known :) I owe him a beer lol
[23:02:10] <FM4k> and thus it is imperitive I drunk him!
[23:02:17] <Cork> yes, it was a bit of a joke, but the serious part is i don't think anyone here will know
[23:04:02] <beachandbytes> and if they do its a little creepy
[23:05:15] <FM4k> lol back in my day, people used to have friends; )
[23:06:58] <beachandbytes> now we have facebook
[23:08:15] <FM4k> Fact: typeof "Facebook" !== "Friends"
[23:09:08] <beachandbytes> tell that to the billion users
[23:09:50] <FM4k> I would if Facebook had Ad space lol
[23:10:36] <beachandbytes> they do
[23:10:37] <CodeFriar> facebook is just a new and clever way to get people to prostitute themsleves for others for free.
[23:11:04] <beachandbytes> ya, there ipo evaluation basically says each persons data is worth 80+ dollars
[23:11:23] <FM4k> that's awful lol
[23:11:29] <FM4k> they have ad space?
[23:11:34] <beachandbytes> ya
[23:11:42] <Cork> CodeFriar: try $('#Encounter_e8642b5d-50ae-4695-83b2-82a47eb0689b').append('<img id="bob" src="data:image/jpeg;base64,' +  btoa(String.fromCharCode.apply(null, r)) + '">');
[23:11:42] <beachandbytes> after they went public they had to start generating revenue
[23:11:44] <FM4k> I wanna start a kickstarter to put "go the fuck outside" ads on facebook
[23:12:03] <CodeFriar> Cork: killer!
[23:12:06] <beachandbytes> i think you can also pay to have your messages be more important then others
[23:12:12] <FM4k> right.
[23:12:23] <FM4k> I have a new mission in life :)
[23:12:40] <beachandbytes> Cork, CodeFriar what is the usefullness of this binary download to image?
[23:12:46] <beachandbytes> why not just send it as image from server
[23:12:55] <Cork> beachandbytes: he gets it from a stream, from a server app
[23:13:01] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: usefullness? to display an image....
[23:13:12] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: all the suffering is caused by the image provider -- evernote
[23:13:16] <beachandbytes> CodeFriar, do you not controll the server?
[23:13:31] <Cork> no
[23:13:35] <CodeFriar> Cork: btw, I wired that b64 encoding bit directly into the thrift wire protocol code.
[23:13:55] <beachandbytes> ahh interesting, what are you trying to do with evernote stream?
[23:13:55] <CodeFriar> Now the thrift code magically gives back a useful f'ing image stream
[23:14:00] <beachandbytes> evernote is pretty awesome
[23:14:09] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: display bits in a third party system. More on 3/4
[23:14:16] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: more on 3/4/13
[23:14:18] <CodeFriar> that is
[23:14:24] <beachandbytes> cool
[23:15:36] <beachandbytes> why consume the evernote stream in js and not server side?
[23:15:57] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: without giving away all the glory details
[23:16:12] <CodeFriar> the consuming serverside is written in a language incompatible with Thrift
[23:16:34] <CodeFriar> Certain constructs are missing -- like the ability to open a byte stream
[23:16:37] <furyFoo> Hy guys , I'm looking to push my JS skills up bit .  What the most complicated vanilla js/jquery script you've seen so far ? I'm talking in terms of difficulty to code not the bazillion number of lines . I've codded my share of apps with 3-6k lines of code .
[23:16:46] <iksik> hello
[23:16:51] <CodeFriar> furyFoo: go fix the jsthrift code.
[23:17:07] <iksik> is there any ready to use plugin, which can handle drag&drop on table borders?
[23:17:59] <beachandbytes> furyFoo better optimize autocomplete in whatever library
[23:18:31] <CodeFriar> whats the magic to trap when an ajax request completes?
[23:19:32] <Cork> CodeFriar: you mean globally?
[23:19:33] <beachandbytes> all ajax requests or an individual?
[23:19:44] <CodeFriar> individual
[23:20:01] <Cork> CodeFriar: $.ajax().always(function() {})
[23:20:15] <CodeFriar> thats on complete ?
[23:20:30] <Cork> yes
[23:20:34] <CodeFriar> cool
[23:20:38] <Cork> done is success
[23:20:40] <furyFoo> beachandbytes : That's something  I haven't touched in ages , should be a painful and fun exrcise . I've looked around and the only thing I don't know how to code are online image editors but i can't find even a tut on it . Is the image editing done by JS or is it server side via something like PHP's GD ?
[23:20:41] <Cork> and fail is error
[23:22:35] <beachandbytes> furyFoo there are plenty of open source ones you can look at
[23:22:45] <CodeFriar> so some of these api calls are sjax instead of ajax. is there a way to fire off say 15 of them in parallel ? I've tried .each but that doesn't seem to do it.
[23:23:09] <Cork> CodeFriar: whats sjax?
[23:23:41] <CodeFriar> Cork: xhr('POST', 'url', FALSE')
[23:23:42] <furyFoo> @beachandbytes I have some on my HDD i guess I'll just have to drill trough their code . Thanks
[23:23:47] <CodeFriar> ie: synchronous
[23:23:58] <Cork> eeeh
[23:24:17] <Cork> CodeFriar: you can't make more then one synchronus call at a time
[23:24:22] <Cork> by deffenition
[23:24:34] <Cork> as the process hangs until the server responds
[23:24:41] <CodeFriar> :(
[23:24:45] <Cork> (and if you AT ALL have an option, don't use it)
[23:24:50] <Cork> EVER
[23:24:52] <CodeFriar> no threading ey ?
[23:25:13] <Cork> javascript is single threaded
[23:25:23] <CodeFriar> i'
[23:25:26] <CodeFriar> m very new to js
[23:25:40] <Cork> you can get threads through webworkers
[23:25:49] <Cork> but its not supported in all browsers
[23:26:18] <CodeFriar> i'm just wanting my page to render even if the 15th call isn't done
[23:26:19] <Cork> but really REALLY; don't use synchronous ajax calls
[23:26:43] <Cork> use ajax and then do something until everything is loaded
[23:28:00] <Cork> CodeFriar: a bit history information; synchronous ajax calls is from how ajax worked at the beginning
[23:28:14] <Cork> its not supported anymore, it only gets legacy support
[23:28:23] <Cork> so all new features and so on will never get there
[23:29:45] <beachandbytes> I'm not sure what language your server side is in, but it seems you will introduce alot of problems trying to do this all in js
[23:30:01] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: you know, when your hands are tied...
[23:30:05] <CodeFriar> you paint with your toes
[23:30:29] <beachandbytes> for sure, I would just investigate alot more on the server side before i assumed my hands were tied
[23:30:46] <CodeFriar> lol, this isn't my first development rodeo
[23:30:50] <CodeFriar> just my first js rodeo
[23:31:06] <beachandbytes> i have a hard time imagining a server side language that could not handle this with ease and serve it up
[23:32:10] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: it's a large multi-tennant proprietary cloud system that we do not control. Our ability to code on it is extensive, but not all the needed types are supported. it works great with soap and rest api's but thrift api's are a bit ... prickly
[23:34:04] <beachandbytes> I understand, I have no idea of your requirements, just interesting to solve such complex issues in js
[23:35:49] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: yeah...
[23:36:56] <beachandbytes> most of my server side languages support thrift, yay for me
[23:37:15] <beachandbytes> go-lang has no library though
[23:38:00] <CodeFriar> i have no idea why this doesn't support async
[23:42:22] <beachandbytes> actually they do have thrift library for go
[23:44:07] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes: betcha that sucker flies
[23:49:00] <beachandbytes> most things in go do
[23:49:08] <beachandbytes> definitly my new fav language
[23:52:27] <CodeFriar> beachandbytes, Cork, feeling up for a challenge?
[23:52:47] <beachandbytes> depends what it is
[23:53:16] <CodeFriar> help me figure out why this library must be done with sync calls rather than async
[23:53:25] <CodeFriar> I can see why some would require sync but all
[23:53:26] <CodeFriar> ?
[23:53:38] <beachandbytes> which library?
[23:54:06] <CodeFriar> https://gist.github.com/0fde8a365f03796ea15b that one
[23:54:47] <CodeFriar> specifically lines 185... (the flush method)
[23:54:54] <CodeFriar> is where it's requireing sync
[23:55:16] <CodeFriar> make that false a true on line 193 and all calls fail
[23:57:55] <Cork> CodeFriar: its all based around synchronous
[23:58:03] <CodeFriar> yeah
[23:58:06] <Cork> you would basically have to rewrite it all to get it async
[23:58:06] <CodeFriar> i was afraid of that
[23:58:27] <Cork> var request = this.getXmlHttpRequestObject();
[23:58:28] <Cork>  request.sendAsBinary(this.getSendBuffer());
[23:58:28] <Cork> this.setRecvBuffer(this.uint8Array(request.response));
[23:58:29] <iksik> i've got something like: <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td> - i have a handle for seconds <td> cell, how can i get one (closest) TD on the left, and one on the right?
[23:58:34] <Cork> ^ sync dependency
[23:58:57] <iksik> second* ;S
[23:59:04] <Cork> iksik: next()
[23:59:12] <iksik> $(this).next('td') ?
[23:59:19] <Cork> no need for td
[23:59:26] <iksik> oh
[23:59:32] <Cork> as the only child allowed on tr is td
