[02:59:10] <HowardwLo> how do you track how long someone has been viewing a page?
[03:03:35] <arthurvr_> just save the time when a user opens a page, and compare with the time when he leaves. window.onbeforeunload
[05:11:23] <DarkChaoz> i need help Im using JQM 1.3.2 and whenever i use data-role table it doesnt load the page at all
[05:11:33] <DarkChaoz> i found out the error is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'not' of undefined on jquery mobile js
[05:11:55] <DarkChaoz> its stuck on the loading page icon
[05:19:58] <mdev> I have an object that when stringify'd looks like [{ID:3, Msg: 'hi'}]
[05:20:14] <mdev> then I have a  var test = [];
[05:20:25] <mdev> when I try and test['msg'] = obj.Msg
[05:20:27] <mdev> says undefined
[05:20:32] <mdev> how I get access to this
[05:21:23] <systemfault> mdev: It’s an array containing an object, so it would be test[0].Msg or test[0]['Msg']
[05:21:28] <mdev> ahh thanks
[06:26:04] <niasd> Hi, I'm trying to test if element's class contains a word, and if so, the class should be changed. Any ideas how to do this?
[06:27:06] <niasd> Specifically - I have a button with a class "button-yes-dark" and "button-no-dark" and several others. I would like to make a function that would change the class to (for example) "button-no-light"
[06:59:09] <adv_> http://jsbin.com/welexako/2/edit , i want to dec sort by the text of h2 , how can i do this?
[07:02:16] <adv_> i think i want the working version of  h2.text'
[07:02:22] <adv_> 'h2.text'*
[07:12:50] <Mushr00m> hi guys !
[07:13:24] <Mushr00m> Does anyone here is on Mac and with FF ? I can't make a simple anchor to get the focus when using the tab key
[07:13:41] <systemfault> Mushr00m: I do, give me a testcase
[07:14:05] <Mushr00m> ok I'll do a jsfiddle
[07:14:51] <adv_> anyone?
[07:17:27] <Mushr00m> systemfault : http://jsfiddle.net/GA59a/ Here you should be able without jquery to go from the left input to the anchor then the right input by hitting tab key but it doesn't work… So my JQuery that need to know when the anchor got the focus can work…
[07:19:10] <Mushr00m> systemfault : same error on Safari but OK with chrome…. I don't know if I can force it with JQuery to make it focussable
[07:19:28] <systemfault> Let me see
[07:19:56] <Mushr00m> thank
[07:24:39] <Mushr00m> Stange thing is that it works if the A is a div...
[07:26:22] <systemfault> Weird.. I googled and found some strange things… like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11704828/how-to-allow-keyboard-focus-of-links-in-firefox
[07:26:46] <Mushr00m> yes me too
[07:27:37] <systemfault> yes… and it's right...
[07:28:03] <systemfault> Try to do: command + f7 (you might need to hold the Fn key while pressing f7)
[07:28:14] <systemfault> Then after, it works the way it should
[07:28:28] <Mushr00m> yes but it's for my client so it should work natively
[07:28:43] <systemfault> You don't understand, it's an OS setting.
[07:28:55] <Mushr00m> but when looking at this plugin : http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[07:28:58] <systemfault> It's not a browser bug
[07:29:11] <Mushr00m> the standart Select
[07:29:16] <Mushr00m> on the top
[07:29:31] <Mushr00m> they use a A with tabindex to make it focusable
[07:29:36] <Mushr00m> and it works
[07:29:45] <Mushr00m> the "Into This" one on the right
[07:31:32] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Well.. your code also works if you remove the href from the <a>
[07:31:49] <systemfault> (The <a> chosen has doesn't have a href either)
[07:33:21] <springirl> hi is there a way to add data attributes to items of jquery ui autocomplete?
[07:33:51] <Mushr00m> systemfault : I tried without the Href and still doesn't work
[07:33:58] <Mushr00m> strange OS behavior
[07:34:34] <systemfault> I agree
[07:34:42] <cannap> Hi can any tell me how i can remove the complete div tree '.builder-helper' the red ones http://jsfiddle.net/2vXvz/12/
[07:35:17] <Mushr00m> systemfault : And there is no JS way to tell the browser to add the element to the focusable ones ?
[07:36:42] <systemfault> Mushr00m: You could "hack" it… but it would be ugly. If the user really has an accessibility issue, he's going to have "all controls" enable at the OS level, I think
[07:37:00] <Mushr00m> It's for a form
[07:37:16] <systemfault> Mushr00m: why do you want a <a> then?
[07:37:19] <Mushr00m> I transform Select into Dropdown so the tab key is important
[07:37:21] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Just use a button
[07:37:23] <Mushr00m> Maybe I'll change my anchor to a button…
[07:37:27] <Mushr00m> same idea ;-)
[07:37:32] <Mushr00m> I'll do that
[07:37:34] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Or use an anchor without a href
[07:37:39] <systemfault> (Like chosen)
[07:37:48] <Mushr00m> I tried without an href
[07:37:52] <Mushr00m> but it didn't work
[07:39:34] <springirl> hi is there a way to add data attributes to items of jquery ui autocomplete?
[07:40:03] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Weird.. just did it and it worked :(
[07:40:09] <systemfault> It also works for chosen
[07:40:15] <Mushr00m> give me the link
[07:40:23] <Mushr00m> yes work for chosen
[07:42:26] <springirl> hello?
[07:44:07] <systemfault> Mushr00m:My bad, I was trying it in chrome.. yea, still doesn't work on FF
[07:44:14] <Mushr00m> ok
[07:45:56] <systemfault> chosen probably use JS to fix it…
[07:46:01] <systemfault> I'll check
[07:46:09] <Mushr00m> I try to understand it to
[07:46:19] <Mushr00m> works with this one to : http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[07:48:02] <raboof> I'm trying to do a $.ajax call with HTTP Digest authentication. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ suggests I can simply add 'username' and 'password' settings, but this does not appear to work: see http://pi.bzzt.net for the non-working code (including username/password, not so secret just yet ;) )
[07:48:17] <raboof> anyone an idea what's going on?
[07:51:08] <systemfault> raboof: Because username/password use the url to send the credentials
[07:51:23] <systemfault> raboof: It's not what you want, you need to add the proper HTTP heard
[07:51:25] <systemfault> *header
[07:51:43] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Looks like both plugins do magic to keep the tabindex working
[07:52:40] <Mushr00m> yep and I can't find how ^^ Such a shame select are not customisable with css
[07:52:53] <systemfault> Yeah… it sucks
[07:52:55] <raboof> systemfault: hmm ok that's not what I want... the docs did suggest they'd be used 'in response to an HTTP access authentication request'..
[07:53:02] <systemfault> Mushr00m: Usually, I end up using "select2"
[07:53:46] <Mushr00m> I think I will endud doing the same
[07:53:52] <systemfault> raboof: I know.. but in practive, all it does it change the url to : http://<username>:<password>@<url>
[07:54:12] <systemfault> raboof: It's not what you want for digest authentication (it works with HTTP headers)
[07:54:36] <raboof> yeah I know how Digest auth works, just didn't want to write the code for it :)
[07:55:01] <systemfault> raboof: I'm sure there must be some jquery plugin for that purpose.
[07:56:50] <Mushr00m> thanks for your help
[07:57:29] <NicholasC> I've got a html structure that looks a bit like this: UL->(LI->UL->(LI)), so multiple LI's in one UL with each of those LI's having one UL with mutliple LI's. How do I stop .sortable from dropping things in those child UL's?
[08:16:04] <uskerine> hi

[08:22:15] <DarkChaoz> its stuck on the loading page icon
[08:22:22] <DarkChaoz> i found out the error is Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'not' of undefined on jquery mobile js
[08:27:27] <marko__> hmm any know why this is not working i want to find all divs with class "sc-col-*) * any number and append test in the div the founded var columns = $(content).find('.sc-col-*').append('test');
[08:28:42] <NicholasC> marko__, sc-col-* is not a valid css selector.
[08:28:57] <marko__> hmm i thinked * is for any?
[08:29:08] <DarkChaoz> can someone help me with the data role table issue
[08:29:11] <whitby> marko__ if there is a space
[08:29:12] <NicholasC> try "div[class*='sc-col-']" instead.
[08:29:29] <whitby> As in .sc-col *
[08:29:34] <whitby> Or what NicholasC said.
[08:30:03] <NicholasC> whitby, I prefer official css selectors, makes troubleshooting later easier :)
[08:30:49] <NicholasC> marko__, related reading: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#matching-attrs
[08:35:18] <marko__> thx works

[08:49:17] <adv_> in what form should i bring a date from sql in order to parse it and sort it in jquery ?
[08:50:34] <systemfault> adv_: I'd personally use ISO 8601
[08:51:55] <uskerine> in DataTables.net, how do I select a given column data by name?
[08:52:03] <uskerine> so my columns are: ID, NAME, COMPANY, FOO
[08:52:09] <uskerine> how do I get value COMPANY?
[08:52:24] <adv_> systemfault: and then? which function to sort/parse?
[08:52:59] <systemfault> adv_: When I deal with date, I add moment.js in my project.
[08:57:29] <maoko> Hi all, is there a way to differentiate "tap" and "swipe" events?
[08:57:50] <maoko> So that I could say a hover like status when user taps on the item and scroll that item if he swipes
[09:05:22] <edulix> hi people, I'm trying to scroll the page to the top, why doesn't $("body").scrollTop() doesn't seem to work?
[09:07:17] <systemfault> edulix: Depending on the browser, you need to scroll body or html
[09:07:27] <systemfault> So: try $("body, html").scrollTop()
[09:08:56] <edulix> ok, thanks
[09:09:34] <phelix> Would anyone know how to use the isotope to only display a specific amount of items?
[09:17:08] <t432> do have access to variable between multiple windows?
[09:17:28] <t432> e.g. can win 1 access var thats in win 2?
[09:18:51] <nitrix> Lol.
[09:19:14] <nitrix> t432: You'd need a middle point, a backend server that lets them communicate.
[09:19:29] <t432> my goodness
[09:19:43] <nitrix> Why are you surpised?
[09:19:52] <nitrix> Javascript runs in a sandbox.
[09:20:05] <t432> thats an overkill for what i'm trying to do, which is to set a data field in dom after redirect
[09:20:31] <nitrix> Well, design your shit better.
[09:21:31] <t432> how would you do it? I have a window with  a data field set, i'd like to take that data field and set put it in window 2 then close that window
[09:35:17] <t432> this may sounds bit nonsensical but i need to call a javascript function from a server
[09:35:21] <t432> is this possible?
[09:44:46] <droid909> i have two objects that are linked, how do i unlink them?
[09:45:23] <Lost123> I have nested submenus, i want to add a unique number to each li id, i used jQuery( "ul.left-menu > li > ul > li > ul >li" ).attr("id","item-num"+jQuery(this).index());
[09:45:39] <Lost123> but i get -1 as index everytime, any suggestions?
[09:46:00] <tiblock> Hi. I need to know in what <DIV> selected text (with mouse) is located. What is correct request to google? I try for 30 minutes and all what i found is how to make dropdown and select div via js -_-
[09:46:42] <decx> Lost123 this in this context is window and not your li
[09:47:17] <Lost123> decx: how can i get index of li?
[09:48:02] <tiblock> Anybody? I just need request's text to google not the solution. My english is very bad so i dont know correct request
[09:48:03] <decx> us each
[09:48:07] <decx> use
[09:48:19] <Lost123> example? how to?
[09:48:23] <decx> or better yet
[09:48:27] <decx> scrap the attr and use prop
[09:48:44] <Lost123> i have wrapped the above line in jQuery( document ).ready(function() {
[09:49:07] <decx> collection.prop('id',function(i,_){ return 'num_'+i})
[09:50:06] <Lost123> omg thats sounds so hard
[09:50:21] <tiblock> yay, found solution http://jsfiddle.net/Q982A/2/
[09:50:22] <decx> it's shorter than what you have
[09:50:30] <decx> Lost123 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/KnP7T/
[09:57:01] <kunalg> Hi, is there any way to get all events associated with an object? Without using clone, I want to copy them to a new one.
[10:14:18] <Fraz> hi
[10:28:35] <coderdj412> hello
[10:47:41] <Fraz> i cant figure this out, how do i make it so i can call functions outside of my plugin so i can do something like var p = $('#mydiv').myplugin(); p.somemethod();
[10:47:56] <Fraz> or $('#mydiv').myplugin().someMethod();
[10:48:19] <Fraz> while supporting multiple elements aswell
[10:49:11] <systemfault> Fraz: $.fn.myPlugin = function() { return this.each(function() { var node = $(this); doSomething(); });} IIRC
[10:50:07] <coderdj412> Is it possible to attach jqueryui autocomplete to multiple inputs?
[10:50:21] <merobertsjr> I cant figure out what to do to fix CORS issue with http://pastebin.com/TqsdiW4z what am i missing here its a basic get request for json?
[10:51:58] <Fraz> systemfault, yeh but then the element is returned, not the plugin..so how can i call my plugin methods from that?
[10:52:23] <systemfault> Ah, most jQuery plugins don't work that way
[10:52:35] <Fraz> oh
[10:53:32] <systemfault> Instead of var p = $('#mydiv').myplugin(); p.somemethod(); you'd do something like var p = $('#mydiv').myplugin();  (p is the node) then after, you can do var p = $('#mydiv').myplugin('somemethod', arg1, arg2);
[10:53:51] <systemfault> That pattern is what you often see with jquery plugins
[10:53:59] <Fraz> systemfault, yeh ive looked into that pattern
[10:54:14] <Fraz> but id like to do chaining too
[10:54:16] <systemfault> I think it's ugly… but it encourages chaining
[10:54:32] <Fraz> oh how do you handle chaning with that pattern then?
[10:54:36] <decx> could probably just do this.extra = function() inside your plugin function but not inside the return this.each
[10:54:37] <Fraz> chaining*
[10:54:46] <jisan2> hiii
[10:54:49] <jisan2> got a question
[10:54:58] <jisan2> how do i make a simple toggle text?
[10:55:07] <systemfault> Fraz: I do it the way I don't really like :P
[10:55:41] <Fraz> yeh i was thinking of that decx but then i will need to run .each in every function call, right?
[10:56:01] <decx> why
[10:57:09] <Fraz> for multiple element support?
[10:59:38] <decx> shouldnt make a problem
[11:00:04] <decx> this inside your extra function will just be the collection that is passed to your plugin
[11:01:49] <decx> anyway, there's probably a reason why you never see that approach in the wild with plugins
[11:07:57] <Fraz> so how do i go about using chaining with the patter systemfault mentioned earlier?
[11:08:40] <systemfault> Fraz: you always do a .each… that returns the collection, you get chaining for free
[11:11:26] <jisan2> i need some jquery help
[11:11:47] <Fraz> systemfault, yeh but...
[11:12:12] <BillCriswell> I type "requite" every damn time I try to type require.
[11:12:16] <Fraz> $('.foo').bar('baz') << how do i chain with this syntax?
[11:12:41] <jisan2> how to get some values from the current <li> and add that to a form
[11:12:46] <Fraz> $('.foo').bar('baz').?
[11:12:58] <jisan2> when someone clicks on a button , some values will be added to a form..
[11:13:00] <jisan2> how to do that?
[11:13:30] <decx> if you want to work with a form, how about using form elements
[11:13:36] <decx> crazy right
[11:15:04] <jisan2> form elements?
[11:15:09] <jisan2> form is already there
[11:15:23] <NicholasC> Are you appending values to existing form elements?
[11:15:29] <NicholasC> Or would you need to add new form elements?
[11:15:31] <jisan2> i just want to populate some form fields by some content that are in a div
[11:15:44] <jisan2> NicholasC exactly
[11:15:48] <jisan2> i want to append it when someone clicks on a button
[11:15:49] <NicholasC> Oh. $(formfieldselector).val("Value here");
[11:16:05] <jisan2> cool
[11:16:14] <jisan2> thank you mate
[11:16:17] <jisan2> another question
[11:17:11] <jisan2> i want it happen only when someone clicks on a button
[11:17:18] <NicholasC> You could do something similar with extra elements: $(formselector).append("<input type='hidden' name='whatever' value='aval'/>");
[11:17:31] <NicholasC> Well, make a function out of your buttong click then
[11:17:42] <jisan2> hmmmm
[11:17:51] <NicholasC> $(buttonselector).click(function(){ $(formfieldselector).val("Value here"); });
[11:18:44] <jisan2> what if i want to append multiple elements. there will be more than one button. I want to seprate the inputs with commas
[11:19:31] <NicholasC> Well, there's a number of ways to do that. You'd have to execute the append multiple times, either hardcoded or through a for or each loop
[11:19:54] <jisan2> hmmm
[11:19:54] <NicholasC> This is all pretty basic stuff you could (and should!) experiment with, though.
[11:24:48] <paulvd> hello, is there a way in jquery to find out how much seconds it took to load the page ? basically there is a video on the page, and i want to hide it on slower connections
[11:26:16] <decx> a timer in a global var?
[11:27:11] <paulvd> any link that i can see?
[11:27:26] <decx> jsfiddle is crapping itself
[11:27:56] <NicholasC> paulvd: Really, you should've googled this one: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5188648/get-time-for-page-to-load-in-jquery this was the top result for "Page load time jquert"
[11:27:58] <NicholasC> jquery*
[11:28:12] <NicholasC> Sadly jsFiddle doesn't work, as decx  mentioned.
[11:28:51] <jisan2> NicholasC , how to make this toogle ? the default text is "play" when someone clicks on, it becomes "pause", then again play..
[11:29:07] <decx> that stack is basicly what i mean
[11:30:11] <NicholasC> Jisan2: Nothing fancy I assume?
[11:30:27] <jisan2> nothing fancy, just that
[11:30:51] <decx> there are many ways to do a toggle text change
[11:31:33] <decx> both texts in spans and swithcing display, saving defaulttext in a data attribute, saving defaulttext in a var in higher scope
[11:32:49] <NicholasC> Or this one: $(selector).click(function(){ if($(this).data('state') === 'pause') { $(this).html('Play').data('state', 'play'); } else { $(this).html('Pause').data('state', 'pause'); }});
[11:33:02] <NicholasC> This does assume you've got NO child elements.
[11:33:05] <NicholasC> Because they'll get stripped.
[11:33:19] <jisan2> no child element
[11:33:35] <NicholasC> Decx's thing is better though, but requires some extra HTML. sec.
[11:33:37] <jisan2> thank you mate, i'm trying this out
[11:34:50] <NicholasC> <button class="clickMe"><span style="display: none;">Pause</span><span>Play</span></button> $('.clickMe').click(function(){ $(this).children('span').toggle(); });
[11:35:15] <NicholasC> That's decx> both texts in spans and swithcing display
[11:35:38] <decx> hey i gave 3 ways, i would never do the span toggle
[11:36:08] <NicholasC> Well, yeah, I've said it was one of your ways, didn't I?
[11:36:28] <decx> your data-attribute solution is a bit verbose
[11:36:34] <paulvd> jQuerytime = new Date() - start; shows loading time in seconds or miliseconds ?
[11:36:34] <NicholasC> The problem with toggling the spans is that you're never quite sure what the current state is, unless you go and grab the html of the span and look at it.
[11:36:50] <NicholasC> decx, well, sure, the guy's new to jQuery, better to expand it a bit so he'll understand.
[11:37:59] <paulvd> jQuerytime = new Date() - start; shows loading time in seconds or miliseconds ?
[11:38:24] <BillCriswell> paulvd: ms
[11:39:06] <decx> NicholasC i prefer boolean http://jsbin.com/rarusugi/1/edit
[11:39:13] <BillCriswell> Damn, just had the nicest neck crack
[11:39:14] <decx> using jsbin... ugh
[11:39:56] <NicholasC> decx, I'll get back to you when it's loaded :)
[11:40:08] <decx> what jsbin is dying now too?
[11:40:21] <decx> are we going to have to use codepen
[11:40:26] <decx> good lord help us
[11:40:39] <NicholasC> Nah, the latest version of Aurora + Firebug is buggy when it comes to JS
[11:40:45] <BillCriswell> jsbin loaded right up for me.
[11:40:53] <NicholasC> doesn't recognize console.log as a function for one - I've just switched to chrome
[11:41:36] <NicholasC> decx, yeah, that works fine too. It's also somewhat more elegant if a tad harder to understand
[11:41:56] <NicholasC> I like the  var status = $(this).data('toggle') || false;
[11:42:12] <decx> yeah that one is always helpful for init ::>
[11:42:28] <NicholasC> I'm not entirely sure you should throw ternaries at the new guys, though :D
[11:43:05] <BillCriswell> That's not a ternary is that?
[11:43:16] <decx> || isnt, but in the text()
[11:43:19] <BillCriswell> Ternary would be like foo ? foo : bar
[11:43:33] <NicholasC> BillCriswell, open the bin, it's the next line :)
[11:43:37] <BillCriswell> What the hell is that called.
[11:43:46] <decx> short circuit
[11:44:00] <BillCriswell> Can I call it a Johnny 5 from now on.
[11:44:10] <BillCriswell> Nevermind, it wasn't a question.
[11:44:22] <decx> var blah = true; (blah) && (blah = !blah)
[11:44:56] <BillCriswell> I'm in a starbucks right now and it's the weirdest scene ever.
[11:45:46] <decx> guy in a starbucks with a laptop, doesnt seem that weird to me
[11:46:32] <BillCriswell> 3 girls are braiding this other girls hair, a homeless guy is writing something very vigorously on a piece of paper and another girl in exercise clothes is having what sounds like a business meeting and she keeps yelling every minute or so for 30 seconds at a time.
[11:47:08] <decx> welcome to philly
[11:47:58] <BillCriswell> A guy just looked in here, turned around and noped out.
[11:48:01] <BillCriswell> About to do the same haha
[11:49:15] <BillCriswell> Eh, too lazy.
[11:49:30] <decx> what is the next starbucks like 3 minutes away?
[11:49:41] <BillCriswell> Haha not sure. Probably.
[11:49:49] <BillCriswell> There is a bar in this building as well. Might as well go drink.
[11:50:13] <NicholasC> I'm not sure why you'd use a starbucks to work
[11:50:39] <systemfault> Starbuck… still can't believe that company hasn't gone bankrupt yet.
[11:50:56] <systemfault> Their coffee is expensive… doesn't taste good..
[11:51:35] <BillCriswell> NicholasC: I volunteered to take a ride with my girlfriend so she can get her hair done, she doesn't dig taking the el alone.
[11:51:42] <BillCriswell> I don't even drink coffee haha
[11:51:42] <systemfault> Their only good thing is their frappucino… but at that point, is it really coffee?
[11:52:01] <NicholasC> BillCriswell, makes sense then.
[11:52:06] <BillCriswell> I got an iced tea and some sandwich with some cheese on it that I can't pronounce.
[11:53:51] <BillCriswell> The wifi is now provided by google which is pretty cool
[11:54:53] <NicholasC> That is pretty neat, yeah
[11:55:21] <systemfault> 'murrican cheese!
[11:55:28] <systemfault> That shit is nasty
[11:55:52] <NicholasC> Since he can't pronounce it, I assume it's not 'murican.
[11:56:00] <BillCriswell> Some H word.
[11:56:02] <decx> could be that orange one
[11:56:07] <decx> boehner cheese
[11:56:28] <BillCriswell> "Havilah"
[11:56:33] <BillCriswell> Sounds... jewish?
[11:56:45] <BillCriswell> "hard italian mountain cheese"
[11:57:09] <systemfault> Havarti?
[11:57:36] <decx> that's not italian
[11:57:41] <BillCriswell> Ah crap you're right it's that. Had to look at the box.
[11:57:44] <decx> that's like nordic
[11:57:49] <BillCriswell> Danish!
[11:58:09] <BillCriswell> I just looked at a list of cheese and picked one that looked close.
[11:58:34] <BillCriswell> http://www.cheese.com/havilah/ is what I hought it was.
[11:58:38] <BillCriswell> Hahahah, cheese.com
[12:03:08] <decx> that havilah doesnt even have a wiki page. underground cheese
[12:03:38] <decx> and why doesnt cheese.com have a testimonials page filled with cheese puns
[12:06:11] <jisan2> stil no luck :(
[12:06:15] <jisan2> it's not working
[12:08:19] <BillCriswell> jisan2: Dang
[12:09:12] <jisan2> BillCriswell, i'm trying to make a simple text toggle
[12:09:17] <coderdj412> Is there a way I can simplify this traversal: $(this).parent().first().next().children();?
[12:09:50] <jisan2> when someone clicks on 'play' the text becomes 'pause' and then 'play' again on click..
[12:09:50] <BillCriswell> coderdj412: You can drop the .first()
[12:10:09] <coderdj412> BillCriswell
[12:10:18] <BillCriswell> jisan2: They just posted a few demos for you.
[12:10:34] <jisan2> none of them seems to be working
[12:10:59] <BillCriswell> jisan2: They're working in the demos they provided.
[12:12:00] <coderdj412> BillCriswell: thanks. I found the solution to my problem. I can attach autocomplete using $(this).autocomplete and $.each(). I had it halfway figured out. I was updating the list but I needed to update an adjacent form element which I just figured out :)
[12:12:11] <BillCriswell> coderdj412: Niiiiice.
[12:12:29] <BillCriswell> Alright, homeless dude keeps looking at me and laughing. Packing up and going ot the bar haha. Later
[12:12:31] <coderdj412> BillCriswell: I just wanted to see if I could shorten the traversal.
[12:16:57] <jisan2> BillCriswell, one thing to remember. that content area is generated by a jquery script
[12:17:12] <jisan2> is that why it's not working?
[12:23:25] <ewilazarus> hello guys, having trouble with jquery's mouseenter/mousehover ... could someone please give me some help? http://pastebin.com/xyVXtTEU
[12:33:31] <Fraz> is something wrong with jsfiddle?
[12:33:34] <Fraz> seems really slow
[12:36:45] <Fraz> http://jsfiddle.net/5p2sK/1/ how come animations has a length of 2 after only adding one animation?
[12:38:34] <systemfault> jsfiddle is unusable right now.
[12:41:17] <jisan2> why is jquery code not working on dynamtically generated contents?
[12:42:13] <systemfault> jisan2: Need more info.
[12:42:45] <systemfault> jisan2: When you do $(selector), you get a list of the matching nodes at the time it was called.
[12:42:58] <systemfault> If that's what you're asking
[12:43:15] <jisan2> systemfault, the tracklist of this page is being generated by a jquery script
[12:43:28] <jisan2> look at the audio player
[12:43:31] <jisan2> http://testsite.matinee.co.uk:8080/afrikaans-voice-over-agency/
[12:43:49] <jisan2> i want to toggle between "play" and "pause"
[12:44:01] <jisan2> none of the method is working ..apparently
[12:44:22] <jisan2> but they work on other html contents..
[12:44:37] <systemfault> jisan2: I don't understand, works fine here.
[12:44:43] <systemfault> jisan2: What is your browser?
[12:44:47] <jisan2> works fine?
[12:44:56] <jisan2> not that one..
[12:45:06] <jisan2> there are other play links
[12:45:19] <jisan2> beside the 'add this' text
[12:53:44] <cortexman> i'm trying to toggle all checkboxes that look like (li > input > span) + span where the input is the checkbox
[12:54:38] <cortexman> so the first li and the last span are on the same level of hierarchy
[12:56:38] <jisan2> I really need a jquery pro
[12:57:03] <jisan2> A jquery script adds some contents to my webpage
[12:57:36] <jisan2> I want to give some functionalities to them using jquery
[12:58:07] <jisan2> it seems they are not responding to them
[12:58:19] <jisan2> i have tried .on method, still no luck
[13:17:33] <cortexman> a work of art
[13:17:39] <cortexman> check all linkedin contacts who are already members
[13:17:40] <cortexman> $("li > div > input").parent().next(".in-icon").parent().children("div.chk").children().attr('checked','checked');
[13:29:08] <jisan2> anybody alive here? :p
[13:34:04] <shafox> Does anyone has any idea which plugin is used for the sidebar menu on this website http://adventure.com/  ?
[13:38:06] <phoenixsun> when making a Pause Play buttons is it better to have one object and change the listener conditionally or to have to different button objects with dedicated listeners attached to them?
[14:25:34] <timothy> Is this working?
[14:26:29] <Guest62789> Is there a way to do something similar to the standard link to name anchors when using jquery-mobile?
[14:40:17] <phoenixsun> when you use .removeClass() can you remove individual elements and leave the remaining ones intact?
[14:42:14] <tw2113>  wouldn't you just need to pass in the one you want to remove
[14:42:24] <tw2113> .removeClass('removeme')
[14:42:43] <phoenixsun> I have just tried that
[14:42:56] <phoenixsun> got this error:
[14:42:56] <phoenixsun> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[14:43:03] <phoenixsun> on that line
[14:43:15] <tw2113> did you put it in quotes?
[14:43:25] <phoenixsun> ("play-pause-button").removeClass("fa-pause");
[14:43:27] <phoenixsun> yep
[14:43:41] <NicholasC> $(".play-pause-button").removeClass("fa-pause"); might work better for you.
[14:43:43] <tw2113> you forgot the # or . for your selector
[14:44:15] <phoenixsun> ah I see
[14:44:16] <NicholasC> Assuming play-pause-button is a class, not an ID.
[14:44:25] <NicholasC> Otherwise, $("#play-pause-button").removeClass("fa-pause");
[14:44:31] <NicholasC> The $ is kinda vital, though.
[14:44:32] <phoenixsun> its not a class, its an ID
[14:44:55] <tw2113> hopefully you only have one on the page :(
[14:44:57] <tw2113> er :)
[14:45:07] <tw2113> that ( came out of nowhere i tell you! nowhere!
[14:45:13] <phoenixsun> ?
[14:45:19] <tw2113> typo'd
[14:45:30] <tw2113> :D
[14:45:47] <NicholasC> If you have multiple objects with #play-pause-button as the ID, this will proc on all of them, is what tw2113 was saying.
[14:45:48] <phoenixsun> there is only one Play/Pause button on the page
[14:46:17] <tw2113> just saying, 1 ID per page
[14:46:25] <phoenixsun> yeah I thought of that and realised before trying that it would go south on me :)
[14:46:33] <phoenixsun> so yeah just 1 ID
[14:47:13] <NicholasC> Hey, you could always $('.play-pause-button).click(function(){ $(this).removeClass("class"); });, then it'd just proc on the element you clicked and not the others.
[14:48:26] <phoenixsun> I am using listeners to determine the behaviour so the above approach would not tie in easily
[14:49:05] <phoenixsun> the button is a Play button when the video is stopped and a Pause button when its based based on listening to the player status
[14:49:22] <phoenixsun> well thats the approach I came up with. Probably isnt the best one
[14:50:01] <NicholasC> It was more of a joke than anything else.
[14:50:41] <phoenixsun> ah. Meanwhile I am getting the same error though
[14:50:57] <phoenixsun> even with the ammendment
[14:50:59] <phoenixsun> ("#play-pause-button").removeClass("fa-pause").addClass("fa-play");
[14:52:08] <NicholasC> You're forgetting your $.
[14:52:14] <NicholasC> $("#play-pause-button").removeClass("fa-pause").addClass("fa-play");
[14:53:10] <phoenixsun> ok yeah that did it
[14:53:11] <phoenixsun> thanks
[14:53:23] <NicholasC> I told you that it was vital not 10 minutes ago :(
[14:53:31] <phoenixsun> lol
[14:54:22] <phoenixsun> true. I did try reading up on it and didnt anything clear on when its needed. I will have to go back to the reference and read up on it
[14:55:09] <NicholasC> Whenever you're getting a selector, any selector, it's needed.
[14:55:42] <NicholasC> It's not needed when you're accessing the contents of the Object you pulled from the selector.
[14:56:12] <NicholasC> try dumping an element with console.log($('#play-pause-button'))l and have a look at that in the console, it'll contain some stuff.
[14:56:36] <phoenixsun> ok I will try that now
[14:57:04] <NicholasC> So if you'd do var objectPlay = $('#play-pause-button');, you've got an object you can pull your id from through var idVar = objectPlay.id;
[14:57:23] <NicholasC> You could also get the ID directly by using idVar =  $('#play-pause-button').attr('id');
[14:57:59] <NicholasC> The first method creates an object (which is effectively a structure) and pulls it from there. The second method pulls your ID directly from the DOM.
[14:58:19] <phoenixsun> ok yeah it returns a lot of stuff
[14:58:37] <phoenixsun> including the jquery version
[14:58:47] <NicholasC> That's part of any jQuery object :)
[15:00:08] <phoenixsun> I guess this is the point where I should ask what the best JQuery book is
[15:00:12] <phoenixsun> or online resource
[15:00:21] <phoenixsun> what is considered to be the bible?
[15:00:45] <NicholasC> It gives you some handy uses, example: var myListItems = $('ul.thisClass').children('li'); allows you to pulls ALL the li that are child nodes of any UL with class "thisClass" from the DOM. you can then use myListItems.each(function(item){ /* do something with the item (which is an element!) var * / });
[15:01:05] <tw2113> i tend to rely on the official docs first
[15:01:10] <NicholasC> yup, the Api.
[15:01:16] <NicholasC> And beyond that: SO
[15:01:51] <NicholasC> http://api.jquery.com/ they're usually pretty clear with lots of examples.
[15:02:32] <phoenixsun> ok I will refer to that
[15:02:42] <phoenixsun> also what are you thoughts on Angular
[15:02:57] <phoenixsun> I assume responses might the slightly biased :)
[15:03:03] <NicholasC> I like it when working with Node.
[15:03:47] <phoenixsun> I am work on a music player and at the moment putting JQuery in where I need it
[15:03:59] <phoenixsun> I was wondering it Angular was a more holistic approach
[15:04:09] <phoenixsun> it = whether
[15:05:42] <tw2113> last i knew, jQuery and Angular served different purposes
[15:06:17] <NicholasC> Holistic is a buzzword. It doesn't mean anything. That aside: Angular is a framework, jQuery a library :)
[15:07:21] <phoenixsun> I heard that its MVC if I am not mistaken. But what is Angular best suited for? Client-side applications?
[15:07:31] <NicholasC> That said: I like Angular when working with Node. When mixing it with ColdFusion, I prefer Bootstrap as a framework and thus work with jQuery.
[15:08:22] <NicholasC> Pretty much anything you'd normally use any client-sided for.
[15:09:03] <NicholasC> It just demands you conform to its way of thinking and hands you the tools to do that.
[15:09:18] <NicholasC> jQuery throws you the tools instead and goes "Eh, do whatever."
[15:10:33] <phoenixsun> I guess how Php used to be
[15:10:48] <NicholasC> Assuming the tools here are a wrench: For both things (Angular and jQuery) you have to use the wrench properly: Hold it in one hand and use it with turning motions.
[15:11:04] <NicholasC> That's where jQuery ends. Angular tells you which bolts to use it on.
[15:11:56] <phoenixsun> I am still running that analogy through my head and I am sure it will understand it eventually :)
[15:12:11] <NicholasC> I'm not at home in PHP, but.. let's see.
[15:14:04] <systemfault> The difference between a lib and a framework is easy...
[15:14:33] <systemfault> Your code calls a lib. A framework calls your code.
[15:14:41] <systemfault> It's as simple as that.
[15:15:06] <NicholasC> That's what it boils down to, yeah.
[15:15:50] <phoenixsun> thats a clear way of looking at it
[15:33:59] <phoenixsun> has anyone dabbled with the Youtube Player API by any chance?
[15:41:17] <dtrott> If I am using the $.ajax() function how do I force JQuery to POST using JSON and expect HTML back from the server ?
[15:42:47] <systemfault> dtrott: Something along the lines of: $.ajax({ url: '…', type: 'POST', dataType: 'html', contentType: 'application/json', processData: false, data: JSON.stringify(myData)})
[15:43:04] <NicholasC> systemfault, damn man, you're a lot faster than I am.
[15:43:36] <systemfault> :/
[15:43:53] <NicholasC> What?
[15:44:39] <systemfault> NicholasC: I made your write a near complete sentence then you made you delete it? :)
[15:44:55] <dtrott> systemfault: Thanks works great :-)
[15:45:02] <NicholasC> Half a function, yup. :)
[15:45:12] <systemfault> dtrott: Awesome
[16:30:29] <docmur> Is there a simple way to detect which browser open the page and block it?  I have to allow an outside client to access my web system and I want to block IE from being able to use my site
[16:34:23] <gandalf> hi, got a question about $.ajax and co
[16:34:47] <Yahkob> and co?
[16:34:48] <systemfault> gandalf: Ask, sir.
[16:34:53] <gandalf> I wanna use ajax to retrieve a local file
[16:35:02] <gandalf> (using html5 to build a local application)
[16:35:16] <gandalf>       $.ajax({
[16:35:17] <gandalf>         url: "asdf.conf",
[16:35:17] <gandalf>         dataType: "text/plain",
[16:35:17] <gandalf>         type: "GET"
[16:35:17] <gandalf>       }).done(theme.log);
[16:35:28] <gandalf> this works, which is nice
[16:35:45] <gandalf> however in the console.log I get an error about how there's a syntax error in asdf.conf
[16:36:05] <gandalf> I don't even want it to be parsed since it is a plain text file, so why is this happening?
[16:36:58] <systemfault> gandalf: try 'text' instead of text/plain (IIRC, dataType doesn't take a mime-type)
[16:37:13] <gandalf> yeah I did that first, same result
[16:37:42] <gandalf> in fact, when I leave it out completely, I get 2 errors
[16:37:49] <gandalf> one for asdf.conf and one for index.html
[16:37:55] <gandalf> which imho makes no sense at all
[16:38:29] <jisan> hello
[16:38:36] <gandalf>       $.ajax({
[16:38:36] <gandalf>         url: "asdf.conf",
[16:38:36] <gandalf>         dataType: "text",
[16:38:36] <gandalf>       }).done(theme.log);
[16:38:45] <jisan> how do i target somethinng only from the current <li>?
[16:39:43] <jisan> sibling element of the button where an user will click
[16:40:09] <systemfault> jisan: node.find(selector) ?
[16:40:26] <gandalf> what is interesting: if I wrap the plain text in <html><body>...</body></html> tags, I do not get that error
[16:40:36] <jisan> systemfault may i paste the html ?
[16:40:48] <systemfault> jisan: On a pastebin, yes. Not on the channel
[16:40:50] <gandalf> so I assume jquery tries to parse the file as html, even though I told it I'm looking at plain text
[16:42:04] <jeffreylevesque> could someone tell me what window.URL is?
[16:42:17] <jisan> systemfault : http://paste.ee/p/pfKKc
[16:42:31] <tw2113> a property on the window object
[16:42:36] <jisan> when somebody click on the add to form
[16:42:38] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: A URL builder AFAIK
[16:43:02] <jeffreylevesque> so, you pass it stuff, and it generates a URL?
[16:43:20] <jisan> i want the content in ".audiotitle" class gets appended to the pure-form class
[16:43:45] <systemfault> jisan: There's no "pure-form" HTML element
[16:43:57] <jisan> pure-form is on the sidebar..
[16:44:13] <jisan> how do i target the span.audiotitle from this position
[16:44:21] <jisan> .append(jQuery(this).clone());
[16:44:33] <gandalf> got it! added mimeType: "text/plain"
[16:44:40] <gandalf> thx anyways x)
[16:44:42] <systemfault> gandalf: Weird :P
[16:44:45] <gandalf> jup
[16:44:56] <jisan> i want it adds its sibling .audiotitle
[16:45:35] <jisan> via .append method
[16:45:57] <systemfault> $(this).prev('.audiotitle') to access it from .addtoform
[16:46:20] <jisan> then .clone() ?
[16:46:27] <systemfault> jisan: If you have to, yeah
[16:47:11] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: If you need to build a URL… the old way is to hack a string together.
[16:47:28] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: URL is a clean way to build a url.
[16:47:46] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Why do you care anyway? It's not standard and might not be supported everywhere..
[16:48:17] <jeffreylevesque> systemfault: this code i borrowed uses it - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/whisper/blob/master/src/js/audioRecorder.js#L66
[16:48:40] <docmur> :q
[16:48:42] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: Ah cool
[16:48:58] <systemfault> jeffreylevesque: It seems to create a data-uri from a blob
[16:50:00] <jisan> for some strange reasons, not working
[16:50:34] <systemfault> jisan: Write a real testcase on jsfiddle.net or codepen.io or jsbin.com or some other live pastebin.
[16:50:48] <jisan> okay systemfault
[16:51:52] <dtrott> The following appears to work fine, but is there a better way of expressing it ?   :                  $("thead").find(".sort-link").bind("click", function () {...}
[16:53:08] <systemfault> dtrott: It's the same as: $('thead .sort-link').on('click', function() {…}
[16:54:22] <dtrott> K, thanks, sorry I was really struggling with nested selectors.
[16:54:48] <systemfault> dtrott: Yeah, knowledge of CSS is a prerequisite to write good jquery code
[16:56:11] <jisan> systemfault : http://jsfiddle.net/QyZH4/
[16:56:39] <jisan> it works, but when u add .prev('.audiotitle') it does not work
[16:56:49] <systemfault> jisan: It's a textarea… what do you want to do with it?
[16:56:58] <jisan> click on add this
[16:57:20] <systemfault> It appends it after the textarea
[16:57:25] <jisan> i want the .audiotitle class gets added when i click on add this
[16:57:35] <jisan> instead of the "add this" itself
[16:57:35] <jisan> yeah
[16:57:47] <systemfault> Ah
[16:57:51] <jisan> i mean the content of ".audiotitle" class
[16:57:53] <jisan> sorry
[16:59:52] <jisan> systeamfault how do i select the sibling .audiotitle class?
[17:00:15] <jisan> systemfault *

[17:22:10] <haleys> Can anyone reccomend a good jquery responsive calendar plugin? I like http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/ but it’s not responsive.
[17:27:18] <tejas-manohar> hey jquery’ers is it possible to accept get requests in front end js
[17:27:33] <tejas-manohar> Everytime someone sends a message to your API username, we are going to trigger a GET request to this URL with the query parameter 'username', which is the user who sent the message.
[17:27:40] <tejas-manohar> or do I need to use a server side language like php
[17:55:48] <tommi> If I have an onclick event on a div, can I somehow have a function that add some content to that exact div, using the this keyword ?  In other words, can a function know which exact div the onclick event happened on ? And can I then user $(this).html("<div...") ?
[18:42:28] <Blaster> Is there something like next() that searches into the sibling's children as well?
[18:53:42] <paul_uk> hey all, anyone know of an open source paint tool with jquery/canvas?

[21:49:28] <thomedy> hello...
[21:50:12] <thomedy> i have a jquery file it recognizes everything im doing and all the links are good but when i put an anchor around my image instead of text it is an endefined link
[21:50:30] <thomedy> i am aware that it doesn't see the anchor it sees the the image but why
[21:51:02] <thomedy> my cursor turns into a pointy finger so iknow it recognizes the anchor in general but in javascript if my anchor is a box holding an image it gets an undefined
[21:51:14] <thomedy> again ev ery thing works fine in every link but this
