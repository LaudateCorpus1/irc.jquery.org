[04:54:45] <paule32> hello
[04:55:11] <paule32> i get error message from original file from download 1.11 : http://dpaste.com/01S0QF4
[04:55:32] <paule32> i ussing firefox 64.0
[05:20:16] <paule32> hello
[05:20:47] <paule32> i can use "draggable", and "resizable"
[05:21:12] <paule32> but i missing the little pictures around the 4 border corners
[05:21:17] <paule32> how can i add them?
[07:46:24] <paule32> hello
[07:46:37] <paule32> how can i add a class, and remove it ?
[07:46:39] <paule32> eg.:
[07:47:23] <paule32> '<div class="mdc nextclass" id="nwgrip"></div>'+ '<div class="mdc nextclass2" id="negrip"></div>'
[07:47:55] <paule32> so, how can "mdc" delete so, that these 2 lines can be append to a div later?
[08:12:34] <pavonia> paule32: https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/
[08:26:07] <paule32> pavonia: https://jsfiddle.net/rquwvzoh/1/
[08:26:48] <paule32> is it possible to remove the little rect's on the red box?
[08:35:20] <pavonia> Is that a CSS question?
[08:36:41] <paule32> i think it is a jquery question
[08:37:43] <pavonia> So what about .removeClass()?
[08:37:43] <paule32> in line 11: i append the code
[08:38:10] <paule32> but how to hide the sizers
[08:40:47] <pavonia> Not sure how .resizable() works exactly, but I guess you have to remove the ids from the divs
[08:42:21] <paule32> i have add "mdc" to <div class="mdc ...
[08:43:55] <pavonia> Where is that class even defined?
[08:44:36] <paule32> nirvana
[08:45:09] <paule32> hmm, so the actual code don't allow resizable
[08:45:20] <paule32> i can move the 2 rectangles
[08:45:24] <paule32> boxes
[08:45:49] <paule32> but the resizable stuff don't work
[08:49:06] <paule32> ok, i have implement dblclick, then when i double click the box, the resizer appear/disappear
[08:52:12] <paule32> i don't know is it relevant, but when i start resize, i get TypeError in jquery-min.js:2:12412 a is undefined
[10:25:07] <paule32> hello
[10:26:09] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/rquwvzoh/1/
[10:26:41] <paule32> assume, the yellow box has focus, how can i remove the sizers around the box
[10:27:52] <paule32> when i the next box is clicked/mousedown, all objects should be disable/hide the 8 little rects, and set the new to the clicked/mousedown
[17:33:57] <canned> anyone here have much experience with using DataTables? trying to get it to swap out the data used in a single table element based on which links are clicked
[17:36:01] <paule32> hello
[17:36:38] <paule32> can me someone point me out what is wrong with the code:
[17:36:40] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/hzw1bq4L/11/
[17:37:11] <paule32> the problem is, that all boxes (yellow/red) have resizers around
[17:37:32] <paule32> i prefer, only the active box should have such things
[17:38:32] <paule32> next problem: in line 37, the "disabled" command has no effect
[17:38:51] <paule32> so, "all" handles are drawn
[17:40:12] <paule32> and when line 44 is "true" both, the resizable functions seems to create ghost boxes, when mousedown is fired
[17:49:52] <devi8> paule32, you may need to fire the "blur" and "focus" events to add a class that makes it show the handlebars?
[17:52:19] <devi8> furthermore, you don't close the first div so the second div is a child
[17:52:35] <paule32> normal, line 34 - 38 should be removed
[17:53:10] <paule32> but then all boxes have resizers
[18:00:51] <paule32> strange
[18:01:30] <paule32> the code at jsfiddle has other behavour as on my side browser
[18:02:21] <paule32> so, i can't use the resizers to resize the boxes
[18:02:29] <devi8> paule32, you can't have mutliple elements with the same ID
[18:02:51] <paule32> where?
[18:03:14] <devi8> all of your #segrip, etc.
[18:04:07] <paule32> ok, but why have jsfiddle other exec as on my firefox developer computer?
[18:04:16] <paule32> it is the exact code
[18:04:54] <paule32> i have tried the 1.9.1 versions from jquery, and jquery-ui
[18:05:08] <paule32> then i have test 3.3.1
[18:05:11] <devi8> that's not a jquery or jquery UI thing
[18:05:23] <devi8> it's javascript, or perhaps even html
[18:05:48] <devi8> id's are unique identifiers that can only be used to identify one element
[18:06:07] <paule32> i have run the code on the same browser
[18:07:09] <paule32> so, either there is a bug in jquery or there is a mitm
[18:07:49] <devi8> plus I am pretty sure that you don't have to manually add grips to resizable elements, that's what UI does for you
[18:09:13] <paule32> ok
[18:09:51] <paule32> but the question is: why is the code execution differs from jsfiddle, and my machine
[18:17:16] <Woet> it doesn't
[18:17:21] <Woet> you're making the faulty assumption that it does
[18:17:55] <devi8> ready the docs for jqueryUI seems to indicate that there are no handledbars for the resizable functionality. There's a small triangle added to the corner to resize from the lower right only.
[18:23:28] <paule32> so, what differs: http://i.imgur.com/GxFqbA7.png
[18:23:29] <paule32> ?
[18:23:58] <devi8> there are lots of errors in that code
[18:24:44] <devi8> not the least of which is that you are assigning "grips" to the boxes yourself but giving them the same id on two different parent boxes.
[18:25:20] <paule32> ok, assume, i have unique ids
[18:25:35] <paule32> why is resizable useless
[18:25:55] <devi8> it works fine GRAB THE TRIANGLE IN THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER, it will resize
[18:26:35] <devi8> Your self-added grippers are useless
[18:27:07] <devi8> that's not how resizable works. it adds the triangle in the corner only.
[18:28:50] <paule32> ok, i it work
[18:29:12] <devi8> from the first link you posted it worked
[18:29:34] <paule32> how can i set a region where "dragged" can be moved around
[18:29:48] <devi8> it is draggable.
[18:29:55] <paule32> yes
[18:30:46] <paule32> should be never overlap #mausi
[18:35:42] <devi8> they are both inside mausi
[19:47:35] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/hzw1bq4L/16/
[19:47:41] <paule32> strange
[19:47:54] <paule32> "disabled" don't work
[19:48:28] <paule32> when i load the site, all sizers present
[19:48:53] <paule32> when i click on a box, the sizers goes away, but disabled is false
[19:49:35] <paule32> and, i have implement the css stuff for the grips
[19:49:44] <paule32> so, it seems it work
[19:49:52] <paule32> seems ....
[19:55:00] <canned> anyone know if there's a way to make an if condition that checks to validate whether an instance of DataTable is currently initialized?
[20:05:13] <paule32> if (instanceOf ==   ?
[20:17:25] <paule32> now, the final version: https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/hzw1bq4L/20/
[20:17:39] <paule32> puh, that was a mess, but it works
[20:19:28] <devi8> you crack me up. You have all the same problems as you did to start and I'm not sure you changed a single thing. The fiddle doesn't work for me and I think you must be trolling
[20:20:53] <canned> paule32: thanks :) pretty new still to js and jquery in general
[20:20:58] <paule32> update: https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/hzw1bq4L/22/
[20:21:09] <canned> will try instanceof
[20:22:07] <paule32> np
