[05:46:43] <edge> hi
[05:46:52] <edge> Hello
[05:46:57] <edge> I have some issue
[05:47:21] <edge>  I have the following file I want to load in my page using jquery
[05:47:42] <edge> http://mytests.azurewebsites.net/api/values
[05:47:57] <edge> But when I do $ get it doesn't work
[05:48:34] <edge> I think there is an issue regarding csp
[05:48:46] <edge> How do I define that in my html page to make it work?
[06:03:32] <easyOnMe> just curious I have a defined function named timer()
[06:03:38] <easyOnMe> but when I load it using jquery using the $(document).read(){timer();}
[06:03:57] <easyOnMe> it oftentimes it returns a error on the console saying timer is not a function but when I press F5 on the browser it works
[06:04:03] <easyOnMe> this does not happen 100% of the time but it does happen like 40 to 50% of the time which is quit annoying
[06:04:16] <easyOnMe> please help thanks
[12:09:57] <TimLoal> does someone have some time to help me progress a UI widget i'm building and to clarify my understanding https://jsfiddle.net/azstkbe4/
[12:10:11] <TimLoal> I'm currently looking at improving construction adding for each and passing the element as a parameter and attaching instance data to the dom
[12:10:26] <TimLoal> any constructive comments welcome
[12:13:07] <TimLoal> forgive the lack of icons, but i've added some css to mark out the items, to the left of an item will expand collapse
[12:21:18] <hamdjan> hi, how can i match either    <form> <span class="bad_active">  or   <span class="good_active">   </form> . maybe with $theForm.children('span[class=".*active"]');  ?
[12:22:54] <jurkan> .children('.bad_active, .good_active') would also be possible I guess?
[12:23:13] <jurkan> But I really don't know what selectors are the fastest and advisable to use^^
[12:26:18] <hamdjan> yep that seems to work thanks
[12:40:09] <TimLoal> someone ... ?
[13:14:18] <aro> is there a way to fire an event when my mouse is NEAR a given element?
[14:24:32] <jurkan> aro: I'd work with an invisible helper element that has the correct position/dimensions and the normal onmouseover event. Idk whether there is another way.
[14:51:57] <TimLoal> please will someone help me the documentation takes me most of the way but i'm stuch with a few details
[14:53:45] <TimLoal> i probably mostly need clarification on things i already know but am still a little confused with
[15:32:04] <TimLoal> 500+ connections but no one talking?
[15:41:15] <shoky> TimLoal do you have a simple testcase showing your current problem? can't say i understood much of what you're trying to do in the fiddle you posted.. too much code, doesn't work at all, no idea what it's meant to do or which part you have an issue with
[16:16:45] <TimLoal> what doest work?
[16:17:09] <TimLoal> @ shoky
[16:18:29] <TimLoal> I can work on tidying the code, if that helps and stripping out redundunt commnets, i've currently doing that
[16:19:27] <TimLoal> i have basic question so you shouldn't need to look at much of it
[16:20:21] <TimLoal> maybe not having the images is why you think its not working
[16:20:55] <TimLoal> the dom side of things is working exactly as i want for now
[16:33:25] <shoky> TimLoal if i open your jsfiddle link, nothing appears and there's a syntax error in the console. that's what i meant ;p  anyways don't know what your question/problem is
[16:34:20] <shoky> and yes tidying the code and stripping out irrelevant stuff is a basic part of making a testcase ;p
[16:50:02] <TimLoal> shoky removed ~40% of lines, that was a task worth doing
[16:50:16] <TimLoal> not updated yet
[17:39:39] <TimLoal> shokey I've updated a 50% smaller file and checked its all working
[17:45:28] <TimLoal> does someone have some time to help me progress a UI widget i'm building and to clarify my understanding of widgets? https://jsfiddle.net/azstkbe4/
[17:47:21] <shoky> TimLoal that's the same link from before.. and you're still not saying what the problem is or what you want to clarify.. or what this widget is supposed to be doing..
[17:50:28] <TimLoal> yes its the same link but the content is diffrent
[17:51:57] <TimLoal> I'm currently looking at improving construction adding for each and passing the element as a parameter and attaching instance data to the dom
[17:53:04] <shoky> TimLoal no it's the same content. if you update it you need to give the new link
[17:54:38] <shoky> and saying what general stuff you're "currently looking at" is not helpful. not gonna repeat my previous questions again...
[17:55:54] <TimLoal> ok thanks for your help so far i don;t think you can halp any further
[17:56:05] <shoky> lol
[17:56:08] <shoky> k
[17:56:24] <TimLoal> seems like IRC sport of someoen bored
[17:56:32] <TimLoal> IRC isn't what it used to be
[17:57:00] <TimLoal> ans the jQuery community isn't what i thought it would be
[17:57:13] <shoky> not looking at going over your huge code with tons of irrelevant shit if you can't bother to ask an actual question.. or post your updated code :)
[17:58:57] <TimLoal> well you contempt is plain there, as i thought.  ok if 160 lines of code is 'tons' then i doub't your much of a developer
[17:59:18] <shoky> ok sir, got ya
[17:59:47] <TimLoal> and with your language not a professional
[18:00:02] <shoky> please stop now
[18:00:57] <TimLoal> ok sir!
[18:01:09] <shoky> thanks buddy
[18:01:18] <TimLoal> thanks for not helping
[18:01:23] <TimLoal> good job
[18:01:30] <shoky> ugh
[18:07:18] <arc_> who unbannbed that guy
[18:07:20] <arc_> -b
[18:14:04] <shoky> eir probably, some stupid bot
[18:15:44] <arc_> yeah. his ip changed anyway though
[18:18:19] <jak2000> why: this.selected = (this.text == $myProductor.text());      is false when values: this.text="ISKL-KLASSEN ISIDRO" and $myProductor.text()="ISKL-KLASSEN ISIDRO"  thanks
[18:20:51] <shoky> jak2000 then they are not really equal.. make a jsfiddle
[18:54:02] <hastur> hey, so i'm making a jsonp ajax get request, but the data is returned as plaintext... and jquery wants to parse it as jsonp
[18:54:27] <hastur> is there a way i can intercept the response parser, or force it to parse the response as plaintext instead of jsonp
[19:12:39] <shoky> hastur: the server must be specifically configured for jsonp requests to work. you can't parse a remote <script> as plaintext
[19:12:55] <hastur> hm
[19:12:58] <hastur> okay
[19:13:11] <hastur> what if i can't access the server?
[19:13:12] <hastur> it
[19:13:21] <shoky> what?
[19:13:31] <hastur> it's a public endpoint, not mine
[19:13:41] <shoky> ok?
[19:14:06] <hastur> so i am trying to retrieve the data from the get request and display it on my own page
[19:14:28] <hastur> but because the request comes from my page, not the site's page, i have to use jsonp
[19:14:30] <shoky> if they don't support cross-domain requests (via CORS or JSONP) then you can't access it from the client-side
[19:14:50] <hastur> buh
[19:15:43] <hastur> i mean, the thing is, i can get the data using jsonp
[19:15:51] <hastur> it displays fine in the devtools console
[19:16:02] <hastur> but it's just not json formatted. that's where the error throws
[19:16:02] <shoky> that's not using jsonp,  it's just a <script> element pointing at your url
[19:16:10] <hastur> oh
[19:16:12] <shoky> it's not javascript formatted, you mean
[19:16:29] <shoky> jsonp response has to be javascript code, usually calling a callback with the data
[19:16:45] <shoky> jsonp is just a hack using a <script> element to get the remote data
[19:17:13] <hastur> hrrrm
[19:17:57] <shoky> what service is this?
[19:18:04] <hastur> i guess backing up... the way i can get data right now is by entering whatever url i need in the browser and hitting enter
[19:18:08] <hastur> it displays as plaintext
[19:18:13] <shoky> yeah that doesn't help :)
[19:18:15] <hastur> literally all i need is that text
[19:18:22] <hastur> could i use an iframe?
[19:18:27] <hastur> sorry
[19:18:33] <hastur> https://www.urbanomic.com/gematrix.html
[19:18:42] <shoky> that might help you _show_ the other site inside your site,  won't help you get at the data
[19:18:49] <hastur> this is a flash endpoint but if you open the console you can see the requests it's making
[19:19:03] <hastur> well, i could maybe use jq to get the contents of the iframe right?
[19:19:10] <shoky> i meant what is this public service that you're using, trying to connect to
[19:19:22] <shoky> no , iframe has similar limitations
[19:19:29] <shoky> with cross-domain
[19:20:23] <hastur> so the request looks like urbanomic.com/glossget.php?&param1=blah&param2=blah
[19:20:24] <shoky> if it was possible then i could just show a gmail iframe inside my site and steal all my users' private emails ;p
[19:20:35] <shoky> oh that's the public service, ok
[19:20:42] <shoky> do they have docs?
[19:20:52] <hastur> no
[19:21:29] <hastur> maybe jq is the wrong thing? could i get the data with php?
[19:21:40] <shoky> php doesn't run in the client though ;)
[19:21:49] <hastur> shows you how much i know
[19:21:55] <shoky> you can easily get that data probably from a server on the backend..
[19:22:12] <shoky> the limitations are only on code running in a browser
[19:22:12] <hastur> like a curl?
[19:22:25] <shoky> like a curl or php or whatever you are running on your own server
[19:22:29] <hastur> oh great
[19:24:52] <hastur> curl didn't work but wget did. lol
[19:25:07] <shoky> curl worked for me ;p
[19:27:23] <hastur> thank you!
[19:28:09] <shoky> np
