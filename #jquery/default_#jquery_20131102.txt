[00:02:35] <silentboy> ./
[00:03:24] <Vasa> hey is there any way i can use $('body').find(":visible").hide();  which obviously changes all the visible elements to display:none , can i somehow restore the exact display it was prior to changing? the show restores it to display:block which ruins the whole design
[00:03:47] <Vasa> I mean .show()
[00:04:21] <Vasa> what is the recommended way to backup all the changed elements?
[00:04:51] <relipse> are there any jquery datatable examples like yui datatables except are responsive
[00:05:20] <silentboy> If you want to remove structured element use .detach()
[00:05:24] <Stephen> Vasa: http://api.jquery.com/show/
[00:05:45] <Stephen> According to the documentation, the current version restores it to it's previous display
[00:06:39] <Stephen> relipse: Responsive as in resizing for mobile and such?
[00:06:44] <relipse> yes Stephen
[00:07:46] <Vasa> Stephen not in my case, all the elements gain an inline style display:block
[00:08:00] <Vasa> Stephen which they had not previously...
[00:08:10] <Stephen> relipse: AngularJS with https://github.com/codevinsky/sling-ui
[00:08:12] <silentboy> are you using latest releese?
[00:08:28] <Stephen> Vasa: What version of jquery are you on?
[00:08:43] <Vasa> Stephen latest 1.x one
[00:08:53] <silentboy> :O
[00:09:09] <Stephen> Vasa: Ah, you;re doing them all at once...  I see why
[00:09:29] <relipse> Stephen, hmmm, how do i use that sling-ui ?
[00:09:29] <Vasa> Stephen I think i'll try to just erase the inline css
[00:09:59] <Vasa> Stephen then the css in file should take back the place right?
[00:11:21] <Stephen> how about $("body").find(":visible").attr("display", this.style.display).hide()
[00:12:28] <Stephen> $("body").find("*[display]").css("display", this.attr(display))
[00:12:31] <Stephen> Something like that
[00:12:34] <Stephen> er
[00:14:52] <Stephen> how about $("body").find(":visible").attr("data-display", this.style.display); $("body").find(":visible").hide(); $("body *[data-display]").css("display", this.attr("data-display"));
[00:15:23] <Stephen> relipse: You'll need to learn AngularJS first.
[00:15:34] <relipse> yeah that's not happening
[00:15:37] <Stephen> Vasa: : Read up
[00:15:42] <relipse> do you know angularjs?
[00:15:47] <Vasa> Stephen Thank you I managed to fix the problem I used thishttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2465158/is-it-possible-to-remove-inline-styles-with-jquery

[02:42:34] <Trudko> guys anybody using table sorted editable with IE ? it doesnt work for me in IE10 http://mottie.github.io/tablesorter/docs/example-widget-editable.html
[02:44:56] <wfq> hi guys
[02:45:04] <wfq> hope you all are having a good day
[02:47:26] <wfq> guys, I am looking for a calendar that allows me to: a) Add events at any time any day; b) has an easy data structure to be able to save those events in the database; c) Customize how those events are shown (Colors background, perhaps showing icons and most importantly be able to tag them). I
[02:47:35] <wfq> I have seen a few o fthem such this: http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html
[02:47:41] <wfq> any suggestion please?
[02:52:42] <jop008> How can I detect if a numeric spinner is present in the browser on <input number fields?
[02:52:52] <jop008> Chrome supports it but firefox not
[02:52:55] <joroci> wfq what is the server side?
[02:53:36] <wfq> joroci, we will use mostly Django (Python)
[02:53:58] <joroci> oh, i'm not familiar with python
[02:54:09] <wfq> joroci, but that shouldn't matter at all
[02:54:34] <joroci> can you parse JSON with python?
[02:54:35] <wfq> what it matters is how well the front-end script (jquery-based calendar) is structured
[02:54:40] <wfq> joroci, of course
[02:55:08] <wfq> json, xml, anything as long as there is a clear pattern
[02:55:26] <joroci> you can create your own input fields with your own object
[02:56:38] <wfq> joroci what do you mean please? do you refer to the ability of extending the windows that comes up any time you want to create an event so that you can add custom fields? I suppose so but I need a neat jquery calender beneath
[02:56:50] <wfq> something scalable and well structured.
[02:57:26] <joroci> use jquery ui calendar
[02:57:43] <joroci> you can select the date
[02:58:05] <joroci> open a new popup with the input you want
[02:58:18] <joroci> save... create an object with details and send it to the server
[02:58:55] <joroci> i did something similar a few months ago
[02:59:00] <wfq> joroci I don't want a datapicker
[02:59:10] <wfq> *datepicker
[02:59:54] <wfq> I want a calendar over which events can be registered and that it is flexible enough to allow me customise how those events are defined so that I can change the interface and save the data in the database
[03:00:18] <wfq> joroci, if you go here: http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html .
[03:00:50] <wfq> and click on any time, a windows comes up for you to define the event. I need to be able to modify that windows to add new customised fields
[03:00:56] <wfq> for example
[03:01:47] <wfq> something similar to this perhaps: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[03:03:27] <joroci> i'm not familiar with one
[03:03:55] <wfq> joroci thanks.
[03:04:34] <joroci> i thought you are creating it
[03:05:47] <wfq> any jquery-based calendar project that is continuously being maintained and that it is well structured please?
[03:07:11] <bobdobbs> how do I attach events to nodes that don't exist yet?
[03:09:16] <joroci> $(element).on('eventtype', 'element to watch for', function(){});
[03:10:32] <bobdobbs> hmmmm
[03:10:34] <joroci> (parentelement)
[03:11:10] <bobdobbs> what's the difference between that expression, and an expression for nodes that already exist?
[03:11:26] <bobdobbs> oh... I think I see
[03:11:39] <joroci> because you attach the event to the parent of the elements to be added
[03:12:01] <joroci> i'll show you
[03:12:17] <bobdobbs> ah. I think I see
[03:13:04] <bobdobbs> so $(element) exists now, and 'element to watch for' doesn't have to exist now.
[03:14:39] <bobdobbs> thanks joroci. I'm looking at the doc page for on(), as we speak
[03:17:43] <joroci> bobdobbs
[03:17:44] <joroci> http://jsfiddle.net/U2DUb/
[03:18:00] <bobdobbs> ta. looking now.
[03:20:29] <bobdobbs> ah, I see
[03:20:34] <bobdobbs> thanks joroci
[03:21:02] <joroci> NP
[03:21:07] <joroci> oops
[03:22:42] <jop008> I want 2 find out if there is number support in the browser I tried it like this but no alert http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/87/
[03:23:09] <joroci> 87 saves?
[03:25:38] <joroci> what do you mean number support
[03:25:39] <joroci> ?
[03:40:40] <sammych_> so, say I wanted to build a tabbed interface with content that would be taller and wider than the window, what's the most appropriate way to handle overflow? Should I overflow the tab divs, hide overflow on the parent page?
[03:41:19] <sammych_> and fix the height of the tab divs so that it always fits in the window
[03:42:43] <sammych_> that means, that the page has nothing except header and the tabs
[03:55:48] <jop008> I try to use  numberic support on firefox with https://github.com/jonstipe/number-polyfill   and it brings this  http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-11-02_at_11.51.30_AM-2RFU2Ze0.png
[03:56:04] <jop008> So what is a better way to do that?
[03:58:40] <jop008> How can I loop over my number fields on a form? like this $('[data-type="number"]').each(function () {
[03:58:48] <jop008> this doesn't work
[03:59:40] <joroci> got a fiddle?
[04:02:42] <joroci> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/8mTXF/ like this?
[04:04:34] <jop008> I used this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/7zxm9/87/
[04:04:43] <jop008> but your works
[04:07:52] <jop008> If I place your code in a lib function no alert is generated
[04:08:21] <jop008> I see you have data-type=number I have type=number
[04:15:37] <joroci> jop008 change the attribue to fit your needs
[04:21:26] <retsie> I'm trying to check which td's have a certain class, and if they do, add a class.
[04:21:26] <retsie> http://pastebin.com/Tku0DcNn
[04:21:34] <retsie> I dont understand what I'm doing wrong
[04:28:24] <Happzz> retsie the if () isn't what you want
[04:29:25] <Happzz> retsie http://pastebin.com/XxHs6x4A
[04:29:26] <Happzz> try that
[04:30:39] <retsie> thanks
[04:36:17] <retsie> one more question,
[04:36:19] <retsie> $("td:contains('(p)')").substr(0,str.length-2);
[04:36:32] <retsie> I'm trying to remove the last 3 characters of any td that contains (p)
[04:36:41] <retsie> I'm going about this the wrong way I'm sure
[04:36:44] <retsie> kind of new to jqeury
[04:36:47] <retsie> *jquery
[04:37:06] <joroci> $('p','td').substr...
[04:37:29] <retsie> (p) is a string, not the paragraph tag
[04:37:42] <retsie> basically some cells have the text "(p)" in them
[04:37:48] <retsie> I want it removed via jq
[04:38:11] <joroci> oh the text
[04:38:31] <retsie> yeah
[04:40:55] <joroci> $( "td:contains('(p)')" ).substr() seems right
[04:44:16] <retsie> where am I getting the str value from though?
[04:47:12] <joroci> retsie: http://jsfiddle.net/UPfet/
[04:48:04] <jop008> I try this http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/7/ to have a numeric spinner in FF but it looks rather ugly to me
[04:48:50] <retsie> perfect, thanks joroci
[04:49:07] <joroci> i think you need to load the css too jop
[04:49:21] <jop008> I tied to do so
[04:50:22] <jop008> Wrong css loaded?
[04:51:33] <jop008> I loaded the css within external resources but no good screen
[04:51:51] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/8/
[04:57:33] <jop008> If I try to mix spinner with jquery mobile strange layout things happens
[05:00:01] <retsie> joroci: http://jsfiddle.net/5EKPb/
[05:00:15] <retsie> your code works, when I add the seeminly unrelated code above it, nothing works
[05:01:59] <retsie> nm, just missing ()
[05:04:50] <Tingle> what field input event can I bind to, that gets triggered when the value of that field changes? I was using on 'input' - which works fine, but that is not triggered when the user uses the autocomplete/auto fill functionality from the browser
[05:07:15] <retsie> $( "td:not( :contains('(p)') )" ).addClass("unpaid-cell");
[05:07:34] <retsie> so this works, but I want to add an additional condition, so that it only adds the class if the cell contains a number
[05:08:11] <retsie> I couldnt find how I add operators to the not selector, thats the first issue
[05:08:34] <retsie> the second is that I'm not sure how to find out if I've got a number in the cell I'm looking at
[05:09:08] <Tingle> input change and paste dont seem to be the correct events either
[05:15:25] <jop008> Is there a way to prevent letters in an input field on Ffox?
[05:15:36] <jop008> with a spinner I can still put in letters
[05:22:02] <jop008> How do I use this function http://www.technowise.in/2011/06/jquery-numeric-only-input.html ?
[05:36:12] <jop008> I want this numeric input  forced at data entry in all browsers nice to have is a spinner. In chrome I have step + and step -1 but I can still enter letters
[05:36:31] <jop008> I am not the first one with this issue I guess
[05:57:27] <garrilla> if I .clone() an element and I've already assigned an event handle via the .on() function, should the clone have the event handler?
[06:01:08] <shoky> garrilla: only if you do .clone(true)
[06:04:53] <garrilla> shoky, that's it... thx
[06:42:33] <Billy2> Hey everyone, I'm having a problem with jquery's .find in IE8 (surprise surprise) - The error is "Object doesn't support this property or method" on a piece of code, the code is: http://jsfiddle.net/SGHA5/1/
[06:44:33] <joroci> 8?
[06:44:39] <joroci> fuck 8 :)
[06:45:32] <Kal_crunchbang> language
[06:46:10] <joroci> sry
[06:55:02] <jop008> any idea why validate is undefined? http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/22/
[06:55:17] <jop008> If you enter text in the input field
[06:57:57] <shoky> jop008: because it's not global. attach your event listeners in javascript, not html
[06:57:58] <joroci> what's calling validate?
[06:58:07] <shoky> his onkeypress
[06:58:17] <jop008> yes
[06:58:40] <joroci> i don't see that
[06:58:43] <jop008> so how to attach?
[06:58:48] <jop008> onkeypress
[06:58:50] <joroci> oh
[06:58:56] <joroci> wrong page :)
[06:59:29] <shoky> jop008: with jquery
[06:59:48] <jop008> good tip -(
[07:00:06] <shoky> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/ARuxp/24/
[07:04:47] <jop008> thx for making it the code doesn't run in firefox only in chrome wo problems
[07:06:31] <shoky> jop008: works for me in chrome and FF
[07:07:12] <jop008> with what fiddle?
[07:07:19] <shoky> mine
[07:07:56] <jop008> I can not use backspace in the field running osx ff and semonkey
[07:08:09] <jop008> what do you use?
[07:09:20] <shoky> oh, backspace
[07:09:28] <jop008> and arrow keys
[07:09:45] <jop008> I can not use left arrow key
[07:10:42] <shoky> well, then use a different validate function ;p
[07:11:36] <jop008> Again good tip
[07:31:59] <jop008> Is there a way to test for <input type =number? is available in the browser?
[07:44:54] <asteve> can you do two click actions, one after another?
[07:45:31] <asteve> $('#buy').click(); $('#sell').click()?
[08:03:08] <jop008> If I mis the spinner with jquery mobile the styles are mashed up
[08:03:17] <jop008> anyone used this?
[08:10:46] <AlexanderBB10> gezocht: script.
[08:11:50] <jop008> I can use this $.support.inputTypeDate to see if a browser supports date type
[08:12:07] <jop008> but what is the equivalent for input type = number?
[08:16:25] <jop008> Great function .support http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[08:16:31] <jop008> no documentation at all
[08:23:42] <zquad> is there some generally accepted practice of specifying that you are making an ajax call to a webpage as opposed to a browser request?  Maybe something in the header?  Or maybe passing a special GET  param?
[08:24:38] <Velveeta> you can pass a custom header if you're trying to let your server specifically know this is an ajax request
[08:25:14] <zquad> yes
[08:25:17] <zquad> X-Requested-With ?
[08:25:24] <zquad> or which do you use?
[08:26:56] <Velveeta> i don't use them, but companies i've worked for in the past have used them, let me see if i can dig up the one they used
[08:27:59] <Velveeta> i think they just used some totally custom header like X-AJAX-REQUEST or something
[08:28:22] <zquad> someone just pointed this to me: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Common_non-standard_request_headers
[08:28:34] <zquad> X-request-with is somewhat standard
[08:28:40] <zquad> well de facto
[08:29:02] <Velveeta> right, that should work fine, the important thing is that you know what to check for on the server, whatever the header is
[08:29:19] <zquad> yup
[08:29:21] <zquad> thanks dude
[08:29:52] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[08:31:33] <Velveeta> jop008: there' probably sparse documentation because it's for internal use, and properties may be added or removed on a whim, so it's not reliable as an external resource for your code
[08:31:53] <Velveeta> if you want that kind of feature detection, i recommend something like modernizr
[08:57:50] <jop008> someone on this irc channel pointed me to it :-(
[09:12:08] <ale_home> hi any1 here who could help with some "chrome" post requeset issues?
[09:13:21] <joroci> what is the issue
[09:14:09] <ale_home> joroci, hi! it keeps being cancelled... and all i found is it may have something to do with cross domain "stuff"
[09:14:23] <ale_home> but it's just sending some login stuff to a url
[09:14:38] <joroci> so it's not chrome it's every browser
[09:14:57] <ale_home> that url though is being "rewritten" - e.g .from /login/check to go to e.g. /login.php?action=check ...
[09:15:15] <ale_home> yep every browser :(
[09:15:30] <ale_home> i can post the code if it'd help ?
[09:15:38] <ale_home> (pastebin)
[09:15:42] <joroci> it's because of the crossdomain issue
[09:16:13] <rue> :D
[09:16:16] <ale_home> hmmm but i dont send it to a different domain :)
[09:16:26] <joroci> paste the code
[09:16:30] <ale_home> ok 1s
[09:18:46] <ale_home> joroci, http://pastebin.com/bkg96Ftn
[09:19:38] <joroci> what is the server side?
[09:19:41] <ale_home> php
[09:20:03] <joroci> so logincheck.php
[09:20:04] <joroci> ?
[09:20:19] <ale_home> nope
[09:20:36] <joroci> what is logincheck?
[09:20:39] <ale_home>  /login/logincheck is being rewritten to /login.php?action=logincheck
[09:21:34] <joroci> are you sure it's working properly?
[09:21:44] <ale_home> yep, if i test via curl it works fine
[09:22:06] <joroci> uhm
[09:22:18] <ale_home> is it the rewrite ?
[09:22:26] <joroci> maybe , not sure
[09:22:31] <joroci> try to make it direct
[09:22:32] <joroci> and see
[09:22:48] <ale_home> will do..
[09:22:54] <ale_home> back in a few mins then :)
[09:22:59] <joroci> k
[09:23:03] <ale_home> thanks for your help so far joroci !
[09:23:07] <joroci> np
[09:39:39] <ale_home> joroci, back again ...
[09:39:53] <ale_home> so i tried 2 things - 1st is to just go to /logincheck.php
[09:39:57] <ale_home> no luck
[09:40:14] <ale_home> the other is, the full url to it - no luck either
[09:40:18] <ale_home> still being blocked
[09:43:46] <ale_home> in fact, just going to plain "logincheck.php" doesnt work either
[09:43:49] <ale_home> i dont get it :(

[11:59:07] <zquad> sorry I meant an plugin which supports iframes within an overlay
[11:59:41] <limpc> look at colorbox, maybe thats what you're looking for.
[12:00:17] <zquad> thanks checking
[12:01:48] <zquad> cool that might work... thanks
[12:01:56] <happy-dude> hi, I need some help getting some data from a REST api to jquery to process
[12:01:57] <limpc> np
[12:02:18] <happy-dude> I'm using python and bottle and jquery 1.10 -- can anyone point me in the right direction?
[12:02:41] <limpc> happy-dude - $.ajax, $.get, $.post, $.getJSON, etc
[12:03:43] <happy-dude> limpc: for REST -- if I need to get parameters from another program, it would make the most sense for the program to send a GET request -- and bottle with take the parameters from there, right?
[12:03:59] <happy-dude> like url.com/data?val1=10&val2=20
[12:04:03] <limpc> i dont know what bottle is
[12:04:19] <happy-dude> limpc: http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html
[12:04:27] <limpc> but if you're using jquery, you probably want to have jquery handle the RESTful stuff
[12:04:39] <happy-dude> can it do that directly?
[12:04:43] <wast_> how to allocate to first textbox after specific text in html?
[12:05:14] <limpc> happy-dude: those functions i mentioned earlier.
[12:06:08] <happy-dude> I would need a basic webserver to serve that page, correct?
[12:06:18] <happy-dude> and jquery can handle that directly for me?
[12:06:26] <limpc> yes
[12:06:29] <happy-dude> (because I was using bottle to serve as my server)
[12:06:46] <limpc> well you do need something to interpret the python obviously
[12:06:51] <limpc> django or i guess bottle
[12:07:07] <limpc> but for RESTful queries, use jquery.. or am i misunderstanding what you're wanting to do?
[12:07:37] <happy-dude> limpc: I want to send 2 variables that will ultimately be manipulated by jquery
[12:08:14] <limpc> send from where?
[12:08:17] <happy-dude> I may be misunderstanding REST... but from what I saw, I can use a GET request to pass those over
[12:08:17] <limpc> a browser?
[12:08:22] <happy-dude> a program
[12:08:31] <limpc> where is jquery running?
[12:09:06] <happy-dude> here's how it's laid out --
[12:09:35] <limpc> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12811231/is-it-possible-to-post-an-object-from-jquery-to-bottle-py
[12:09:38] <happy-dude> <program sending the data> --> <REST API> --> <jquery to manipulate data and display something for client>
[12:10:43] <limpc> RESTful is from client to server, not server to client
[12:10:47] <limpc> that would be push notification
[12:11:07] <limpc> and id guess you probably need something like websockets for that
[12:11:35] <happy-dude> limpc: I'll look into that; you're saying that REST is the wrong way to go about this, then?
[12:12:04] <limpc> if you're trying to push data from server to client without the client having requested the data initially, then yes
[12:12:25] <limpc> jquery can process the data, but it has no websocket support afaik.. maybe there's a plugin for it.
[12:12:43] <wast_> how to allocate to first textbox after specific text in html? $("td").filter(function() { return $(this).text() == "text"; }).closest("input"); ?
[12:13:43] <limpc> $('td').find('input[type=text]')
[12:15:57] <jolene> What can I say it was like? I'd experienced jerkey's oversexed body before, the previous night in the shower, but my strength, my power, my sexual presence had grown dramatically in the remaining hours I'd been asleep. The three of us barely fit in the bunk bed, even on our side - jerkey's round ass plumped enticingly out of the crumpled sheets, her huge now-exposed breasts smushed up against me. My own chest was thicker now, almost ...
[12:16:03] <jolene> ... twice as thick as it had been when I got back from epsas's place the previous morning, yet I didn't feel massive, since my strength had grown as well. I almost felt lighter, more graceful, as I rolled onto my side to face jerkey. And behind my oversized back, I felt epsas's hands...little hands? Were they little or was my back just so much wider, so much harder in comparison.
[12:16:09] <jolene> I kissed jerkey and she seemed to melt down, her tentative open-mouth, almost innocent response growing almost instantly into a sloppy, desperate face-suck. Those full, thick, slightly darkened lips seemed almost to be starving for me. I felt epsas's thick breasts push into my muscular back as epsas reached past me to guide jerkey's hands to my eleven-and-a-quarter inch dick. "Jerk it." urged epsas in a throaty purr. "Make it big..." I ...
[12:16:15] <jolene> ... was cupping jerkey's gymnastic-firm thigh with one hand. "...make it huge..." I was running a thumb across a nipple that was fattening, thickening obscenely, atop jerkey's jiggling breasts as jerkey slowly stroked the thick head of my dick across her juicy, tight, pussy lips. "..make it grow....whoa!" yelped epsas.
[12:16:19] <wast_> ok limpc but i need to find specific text in td, after which i need to find first input[type=text] after
[12:16:20] <jolene> This last suggestion sent formerly-little jerkey into almost a frenzy. She shoved herself forward, half atop me as I tried to keep from rolling back onto epsas. Apparently the concept of me growing was enough that just mentioning the word pushed jerkey right to the edge. She started shoving inch after inch of my massive cock inside her. epsas scrambled to get out from under me as jerkey rolled me to my wide back. Still, epsas giggled ...
[12:16:26] <jolene> ... maniacally and lowered her voice again, teasing jerkey still further: "Do it, make it expand, jerk it! My god, look at it, jerkey, it's swelling bigger and bigger, huger and huger! It's going to split you apart! Cram it in, harder, harder!!"
[12:16:30] <jolene> I wasn't even halfway inside jerkey when she started spasming with her first orgasm, her hands flying backwards to grip onto my legs, holding herself up as her knees, straddling me, half gave out with the sensation of a shattering climax. My chest - the one she sculpted for me from her horny imagination and overclocked brain - heaved for breath beneath her as I tried to keep control. jerkey made a sound, a squeaking, yet somehow ...
[12:16:36] <jolene> ... musical gasp as she sucked in breath, her nipples crinkled and massive, and she finally moaned, "Fuck me...please, setient...keep fucking me...do it hard! Let me feel your st-st-streeeenngth!" This litle wail from jerkey made epsas suck in her breath - oh christ, I had sort of forgotten this whole thing got started because the two of them shared a fantasy of being physically dominated.
[12:16:42] <jolene> I pushed myself up, first with my elbows, then leaning slowly up towards jerkey's spasming, straddling body, letting her pussy clench and, agonizingly, slowly relax - I didn't know which was more like steel, its tightest squeezes or my cock's newly immovable power. I kissed her breasts lightly, almost as an introduction...then began to bite more aggressively. I put my hand behind her, to steady her body and get her balanced again, ...
[12:16:48] <jolene> ... before gripping her obscenely plush ass hard and beginning to force her body down further onto my dick. "Yes..yes, oh yes!" she moaned. "You're so strong! It's so big!"
[12:16:52] <jolene> I leaned slowly back, more confident that I had jerkey 'in hand', then reached over with my other arm and grabbed epsas by the back of her neck, strong as a vise. "Oh shit." she yelped as I dragged her towards me for an aggressive, passionate kiss. jerkey's almond eyes went wide as she realized I now had sufficient physical and sexual power to pound her perfect body aggressively while still making out with epsas. epsas's own ...
[12:16:57] <jolene> ... realization was just as dramatic, as her previous teasing began to melt away in shudders of arousal and real eagerness. "Ready?" I murmured to epsas. She nodded eagerly. jerkey was still staring, but I could feel she was ready - her pussy dripping, drizzling as I went deeper, deeper.
[12:17:03] <jolene> "You bitches shouldn't act so surprised. You knew what you were getting into when you came in here!" I snarled. Oh my god, my 'dominating setient' voice sounded almost like a roar, animalistic, deep, powerful. I felt it vibrate in my body, felt jerkey almost freeze with her unexpected reaction to it. epsas's blue eyes went huge and unfocused. I surprised everyone, even myself. I tried to keep 'in character' though. "Arrgh...fuck...I've ...
[12:17:08] <jolene> ... got to get it all in...stuff this bitch to the brim!" I jerked epsas closer, kissed her more roughly, her hands spread awkwardly across my heaving chest. "Finger her." I ordered epsas. She was lost in a haze, too caught up in the moment to even respond. "DO IT!" I roared, and she jumped.
[12:17:14] <jolene> "Oh, setient...what are you doing to us...I can hardly control myself..." cooed epsas as she reached out her hand to stroke above jerkey's pussy, to gently finger her as jerkey finally descended all the way onto me. It was everything jerkey had fantasized about - being worshipped sexually by the woman she was jealous of while being fucked by what she considered the perfect male specimen, the body she'd given me. Even her third and ...
[12:17:20] <jolene> ... fourth orgasms came fast, deeper and more sweat-slicked than before. As jerkey lost control, I took it, gripping my fingers into the flesh of her rounded ass deeper, lifting her up and shoving her down harder with each thrust. epsas was getting less direct stimulation but she seemed to get even more excited watching jerkey's body get dominated in a way she always dreamed.
[12:17:29] <wast_> amen
[12:18:20] <limpc> aw but it was just getting to the good part :P
[12:18:24] <happy-dude> lol
[12:20:18] <lostkauze> can i do this in jquery? $(this).css({"top":random + "px;");
[12:21:27] <Seich> yes but you don't need the "px;" in that case.
[12:21:40] <lostkauze> but random is just an int
[12:22:21] <shoky> jquery can handle ints
[12:23:45] <lostkauze> yeah, but doesn't the css function use css syntax? top:40 in css wouldn't work without px; at the end, would it?
[12:23:46] <wast_> i need $('input[type=text]').val('1'); in first input after certain part of html(string)...how to
[12:24:38] <shoky> wast_: and you can't change the html?
[12:24:53] <wast_> i want to change value of input
[12:24:59] <shoky> yes
[12:25:05] <wast_> and no i cant change html :)
[12:25:10] <wast_> cant add id
[12:25:20] <shoky> ok. give an example html of what you want..
[12:25:41] <shoky> better yet make a jsfiddle
[12:25:43] <wast_> 	jQuery("div:contains('sometext')").closest('input[type=text]').val('anothertext');
[12:25:48] <shoky> that's not html
[12:26:05] <wast_> sec
[12:26:28] <shoky> closest goes UP the dom, btw..
[12:27:17] <wast_> u got my point? or not
[12:27:51] <shoky> not precisely enough
[12:27:56] <shoky> jsfiddle it
[12:28:03] <shoky> and we'll make it work
[12:28:50] <wast_> ok, sec
[12:30:43] <siovene> Hi, I'm changing the src attribute of an <img>, and the image gets displayed only when it's *fully* loaded.
[12:31:06] <siovene> Is there a way I can show some real feedback? Like getting it loaded slowly?
[12:31:44] <wast_> google "jquery loading image"
[12:31:58] <wast_> there are simple solutions
[12:32:06] <siovene> wast_, thank you
[12:32:27] <wast_> http://jsfiddle.net/NcVNJ/1/ shoky
[12:32:58] <wast_> i can only refer to Info_005
[12:33:15] <wast_> and i want to add text to next input
[12:33:17] <shoky> mm you dont have any divs
[12:33:33] <shoky> nm
[12:33:40] <siovene> wast_, well I found things that just display a spinner or similar. I already have that.
[12:33:56] <siovene> wast_, I'd like to see the image load from top to bottom like if it were loaded regularly.
[12:34:14] <wast_> sorry i dont know that, i thought you r looking for spinners :)
[12:34:22] <siovene> :)
[12:34:24] <siovene> Anybody else?
[12:35:02] <wast_> siovene like here http://krojackiobrt-majdak.hr/galerija.php ?
[12:35:12] <wast_> thats what u want?
[12:35:45] <wast_> pics r loading from top to bottom
[12:35:53] <siovene> wast_, yes, but I guess those are just loaded regularly, as in *without* changing the src attribute via JavaScript.
[12:36:24] <wast_> yep
[12:36:55] <shoky> wast_: http://jsfiddle.net/NcVNJ/2/
[12:37:35] <wast_> yay thats it
[12:37:59] <wast_> thx
[12:38:01] <lostkauze> is there something wrong with this? 		var random = (Math.floor(Math.random() * 2) == 0) ? 0 - random : random;
[12:38:32] <shoky> you're referring to random before it's declared?
[12:38:52] <lostkauze> oh you're right
[12:38:54] <lostkauze> cheers
[12:43:39] <shoky> siovene: well, you could replace the <img> with a new <img> instead, no?
[12:44:29] <siovene> shoky, that would have the desired effect? Cool.
[12:44:50] <siovene> Though it wouldn't be very robust, because I have to remember to copy all attributes, even if I change them later.
[12:45:03] <Dexx1__> Can someone take a look at my code? (Line 16) -- http://pastie.org/private/gzmahhubbwvauodkt6vprw -- I am trying to retrieve a JSON file and build a simple HTML table
[12:48:40] <shoky> Dexx1__: you're re-using the same elements for each <tr>
[12:49:15] <shoky> Dexx1__: use .clone() on the original to make a fresh element each time
[12:50:42] <Dexx1__> shoky: which line?
[12:51:17] <shoky> Dexx1__: uhmm also you're not resetting those fill strings.. so the .replace will only work the first time
[12:59:30] <Dexx1__> shoky: which line is this in?
[13:27:15] <Velveeta> Dexx1__: still needing help on this?
[13:27:33] <Dexx1__> Velveeta: yea.. :/
[13:28:16] <Velveeta> so, one thing i would advise is to not even use your headerFill and rowFill variables
[13:28:36] <Velveeta> since you're just creating them as static text with a variable replacement, just do string concatenation inside your loops
[13:29:43] <Velveeta> e.g. instead of doing the 3 lines of headerFill stuff inside your loop on like 58, just do this: $(headerRow).append('<th>' + property + '</th>');
[13:32:01] <Dexx1__> hmm
[13:32:03] <Dexx1__> I see
[13:32:14] <Velveeta> the other thing that needs to be done is like shoky said, you're recycling the same element over and over for headerRow and rows
[13:33:12] <Velveeta> er actually, i guess that wouldn't apply to headerRow, which'll probably just be a single row i imagine
[13:33:18] <Velveeta> is the body a single row also?
[13:33:58] <Velveeta> doesn't look like it the way it's written, since you're appending rows to $('#dataTable') on each iteration, so i'd definitely move the initialization of rows to inside that loop, so that on each iteration, you get a new rows element
[13:34:04] <Dexx1__> Velveeta: you mean like this?
[13:34:05] <Dexx1__> http://pastie.org/private/msfob4ucpcc7z0afekqq
[13:34:20] <Dexx1__> Velveeta: it should literally look like a regular old html TABLE based on that JSON data
[13:35:07] <Velveeta> so, there are a couple of things wrong there… one is that your header, by that description, should be a single row
[13:35:20] <Velveeta> and on each iteration of your loop, you're doing $(header).append(headerRow)
[13:35:35] <Velveeta> so if you have 5 fields you're iterating over, you're appending your row to the thead 5 times, instead of once
[13:35:53] <Velveeta> you should append the row to the header once, and append the cells to the headerRow on each iteration
[13:36:18] <Velveeta> so what you did on line 61 is fine, but you need to move 63 below your loop, like to line 66, and you can lose line 64 altogether
[13:36:35] <Velveeta> because 64 is now being taken care of on 61
[13:47:43] <krambiorix> hi guys, how can i bind a click event to an element that doesn't exist yet?
[13:48:31] <Velveeta> btw, shoky: i was interested in the perf difference between our 2 methods (cloning a base node vs creating it fresh through a selector string) so i made a jsperf test out of curiosity  http://jsperf.com/new-element-selector-vs-cloned-node
[13:49:07] <Velveeta> krambiorix: this is the old method: http://api.jquery.com/live/ … this is the current method: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:51:08] <krambiorix> Velveeta, hmm that doesn't work ...
[13:52:03] <Velveeta> it does if you use it properly, how are you trying to use it?
[13:52:56] <Velveeta> .on needs to be bound to a container that the not-yet-created node will be a child of, not to the not-yet-created selector itself, or else it won't match anything to bind to
[13:53:06] <krambiorix> Velveeta,  $(".delete_verificator").on('click',function(){
[13:53:25] <krambiorix> oow
[13:53:29] <Velveeta> right, that's how you bind a regular event listener to an element that currently exists
[13:53:47] <Velveeta> you want something like this: $(document).on('click', '.delete_verificator', function () {});
[13:54:11] <krambiorix> Velveeta, great!
[13:54:18] <Velveeta> or if you can confine that scope further down into the document, that's even better.. like if all of your delete_verificator items are going to live inside a table with #myTable selector
[13:54:32] <Velveeta> you can just do $('#myTable').on('click', '.delete_verificator', function () {})
[13:54:56] <Velveeta> binding to document will catch them anywhere on the page that they happen to be injected
[14:00:56] <limpc> how do you find the closest <tr> element ABOVE (or before) the current <tr>?
[14:02:00] <limpc> if i have <tr></tr><tr></tr><tr></tr>, user clicks on an action in the 2nd <tr>, and I need to also perform an action against the 1st <tr> above it, how do i find it?
[14:03:40] <pixelpimp> !api prev @ limpc
[14:03:40] <b-ot> limpc: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[14:04:00] <limpc> nice, thanks
[14:06:16] <lostkauze> can  you check where the mouse entered through an object?
[14:07:40] <limpc> what do you mean by 'where'?
[14:07:43] <limpc> like direction?
[14:08:18] <lostkauze> like from the bottom of the object, or from the upper side
[14:08:32] <lostkauze> maybe the coordinates of the cursor when it hovered the object for the first time
[14:09:02] <limpc> that would probably be the best way. obj top/left + length + height = coords, then mouse xy
[14:09:26] <lostkauze> ohh
[14:09:29] <lostkauze> alright thanks
[14:10:44] <limpc> theres alot of javascript libraries for collision detection, btw. you might be able to use one of those
[14:16:36] <Dexx1__> Velveeta: dang, still having issues with this
[14:17:37] <Velveeta> got an updated pastebin?
[14:20:36] <krambiorix> Velveeta, bit late, but thanks!
[14:21:00] <Velveeta> krambiorix: no problem :)
[14:31:17] <Dexx1__> Velveeta: I should start over...too many errors
[14:32:00] <Velveeta> i still haven't seen an updated paste, so….. i can't say one way or the other
[15:01:40] <Cache_Money> I can place a marker on an SVG using D3 with a jQuery .click() event.  However, I'm having trouble calculating the coordinates with a jQueryUI .draggable() event.  http://jsfiddle.net/JX5hK/
[15:09:23] <shoky> Cache_Money: the draggable "stop" event handler receives 2 arguments, event and ui.  ui.offset will give you the draggable's offset
[15:14:32] <Cache_Money> shoky: so that tells me where the object was when it stopped dragging relative to where it started?
[15:16:14] <shoky> Cache_Money: relative to the document, i think
[15:16:59] <shoky> Cache_Money: there's also ui.position for getting it relative to its offset parent, if that's what you need
[15:17:23] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-stop
[15:18:14] <Cache_Money> shoky: for my jquery .click() I'm using e.pageX - $(this.parentNode).offset().left)  to get the X-coordinates of a click
[15:18:55] <shoky> you might have to do different calculations to get it just the way you want it with the draggable
[15:19:40] <Cache_Money> shoky: do you think I can do it within the draggle() stop event or do I need to utilize the droppable() event as well?
[15:20:48] <shoky> don't need a droppable for this
[15:22:33] <shoky> Cache_Money: for example.. http://jsfiddle.net/JX5hK/1/
[15:23:14] <shoky> you can put back the revert:true, i was just testing
[15:26:37] <Cache_Money> shoky: I noticed the .click() event doesn't place the marker in the correct spot in your example.  Why would that change?
[15:27:14] <shoky> Cache_Money: seems fine to me
[15:28:32] <Cache_Money> shoky: dragging the image works good, but when I simply click on the court the circle get's placed like 100px to the right of where I clicked
[15:28:52] <shoky> i'm not seeing that behaviour.. on chrome
[15:29:22] <Cache_Money> actually, I'm seeing that on my Windows machine (host) but not on my Linux VM.  Weird
[15:30:16] <Cache_Money> it looks like it's an issue with Firefox
[15:31:01] <Cache_Money> So, I haven't worked much with jQuery UI.  Is compatibility across browsers typically a problem?
[15:31:57] <shoky> not really. but there is no jquery/jquery-ui support for svg
[15:32:13] <shoky> ill try on FF, sec
[15:33:22] <shoky> yeah i see it, but getting the same behaviour on your original fiddle as well
[15:35:46] <Cache_Money> shoky: yeah I noticed that too.
[15:36:24] <Cache_Money> shoky: in the original jsfiddle the image was above the SVG.  In your example it wasn't.  What changed?
[15:36:44] <shoky> i changed the css a bit for the icon
[15:37:12] <Cache_Money> because I used your draggable() code in my source (with img above SVG) and it places the circle 5px left and 20px below where I stopped dragging
[15:38:20] <shoky> float:left doesn't make sense for it anyway
[15:38:37] <Cache_Money> shoky: I have 5 img's in my source
[15:39:02] <shoky> and since you have the containment set to the svg, the icon should also start within the containment, that's why i change it to position:absolute
[15:39:33] <shoky> so?
[15:39:37] <Cache_Money> shoky: Ahh. I thought containment was where I wanted to drop it
[15:39:44] <shoky> nope
[15:42:35] <Cache_Money> shoky: so should I remove the containment declaration?
[15:43:33] <shoky> depends what behaviour you're looking for. if you remove it, the icon can be dragged outside the svg
[15:45:51] <Cache_Money> shoky: I only really want it to be able to dropped within the SVG
[15:47:16] <shoky> then maybe you wanna use droppable.. though no idea if it'll work on an svg element..
[15:48:14] <Cache_Money> shoky: maybe I should use a canvas instead of an svg..
[15:49:35] <shoky> adunno ;p
[15:50:18] <Velveeta> do you need event support within the svg currently?
[15:50:28] <Velveeta> like do you need to be able to track clicks and whatnot?
[15:54:46] <Cache_Money> Velveeta: yeah I'm trying to take user clicks and create markers onto a basketball court - http://jsfiddle.net/JX5hK/
[15:55:36] <Velveeta> well the reason i ask is that if you switch to a canvas, you won't have access to any of the visual components within it, they'll all just be part of a bitmap
[15:57:22] <Cache_Money> Velveeta: right now I'm using D3 to place markers on the SVG.  I'm assuming there must be a way to do it on a canvas, right?
[15:57:36] <Cache_Money> not with D3 but some other way.
[15:57:49] <Velveeta> well yes, you can place markers over the top of a canvas the same way you can with an svg, i was asking if you needed access to any nodes within the svg itself
[15:58:29] <Cache_Money> Velvetta: by access do you mean being able to click on a node and perform some function?
[15:58:39] <Velveeta> yepyep
[15:58:57] <Cache_Money> and I can't do that with a canvas?
[15:59:04] <Velveeta> right
[15:59:07] <Cache_Money> gotcha
[15:59:16] <Velveeta> think of it as like the difference between working with layers in photoshop, and a flattened image
[15:59:26] <Cache_Money> okay
[15:59:36] <Velveeta> an svg is just another document type that you can embed in the page, and all of its nodes can have hover events, clicks, etc
[15:59:50] <Velveeta> but a canvas is just a straight up pixel map, no interactive elements
[16:00:54] <Velveeta> you could simulate interactivity if you had to, by tracking the location of a click, and checking some data object that keeps track of where items are rendered in the canvas, and associates the click to one of those objects stored in memory, and fires a callback with that as its scope, but that's way out there :D
[16:01:01] <CodesStuff> Anyone know if setRequestHeader in beforeSend allows header values NOT prepended with "X" in all browsers?
[16:01:25] <Cache_Money> Velveeta: I was envisioning allowing the user to do this on a tablet or phone.. Does an SVG still perform well on most mobile devices?
[16:02:18] <Velveeta> codesstuff: i would think that would depend on browser support for those various headers, because that function's just gonna fall through to some native function… if you're asking whether a browser that doesn't normally support a header without an X prefix can be forced to by way of setting them on a jquery ajax request header, i would think the answer would be no
[16:02:55] <CodesStuff> Velveeta: Just tested in Firefox and Chrome and the custom header I sent out worked it seems
[16:03:00] <CodesStuff> At least according to firebug
[16:03:01] <Velveeta> cache_money: (love the name btw) i recently had to do a mobile project involving svg images, and my own phone i tested it on, which is android 2.3, didn't like them
[16:03:21] <CodesStuff> Velveeta: http://puu.sh/56ZgB/b0def81de2.png
[16:03:29] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how android 3.x plays with svgs, but i'm pretty sure 4.x supports them just find, and i would think ios 6+ would just fine
[16:03:35] <Velveeta> so it depends on what mobile support you require really
[16:04:17] <Velveeta> codesstuff: well then there you go, might want to just heck it in a few other browsers to verify it, or do a generic google search on request header support in various browsers, where the header name isn't prefixed with X
[16:04:43] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure it's fairly widely supported, if not universally, but that'll be a browser-specific question as opposed to one about jquery's support for it
[16:04:59] <esmic> how many syntaxes am i failing here
[16:05:01] <esmic> var maxmana = mana / doebtgo * tregangemana;
[16:05:03] <CodesStuff> Velveeta: Yeah. Just figured I'd ask in here :P
[16:05:23] <Velveeta> esmic: zero?
[16:05:34] <esmic> it returns NaN
[16:05:57] <Velveeta> well that's not a syntax error… NaN is a toxic value, if you have it as a member of any part of your equation, the whole equation will evaluate to NaN
[16:06:09] <Velveeta> so check the values of mana, doebtgo, and tregangemana
[16:06:12] <esmic> maybe its because its not set yet
[16:06:14] <esmic> ahh
[16:06:37] <Velveeta> but syntactically it's just fine :)
[16:52:18] <t3ch> Can anyone tell me what happens when I execute an ajax call that creates html with a javascript function for an onclick listener and inserts it into a page.  I then add the onclick event listerner after it's loaded.  When I click the object that has been loaded dynamically, after attaching the onclick listener to the function, the html output gives me "[object mouseevent]"
[16:56:28] <esmic> can i make a condition here that fysik cannot be lower than 1? $("#fysik").text(fysik);
[16:57:00] <pixelpimp> if (fysik < 1)
[16:57:49] <pixelpimp> you could also do a ternary conditional if you want some ugly code: $('#fysik').text((fysik < 1)?1:fysik)
[16:58:30] <sacho> t3ch, test case please, your description doesn't make much sense
[16:58:38] <esmic> $('#fysik').text((fysik < 1);        ?
[16:58:45] <esmic> or what you wrote
[16:58:50] <pixelpimp> what i wrote, of course
[16:59:02] <pixelpimp> missing about half that ;)
[17:00:33] <CodesStuff> *cough* jquery
[17:00:35] <dcope> hey all, if i have an on click event, is it possible to get a data attribute from the clicked element?
[17:00:37] <CodesStuff> oops
[17:00:50] <dcope> getting this when calling data() on event.srcElement: TypeError: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'data'
[17:06:35] <sacho> wrap it in a jquery collection.
[17:06:43] <sacho> also use `this`
[17:07:35] <esmic> ty pixel, btw how to set it to a var
[17:07:45] <esmic> var fysik = classFysik+classProffysik; cannot be lower than 1

[17:25:50] <b0nn> hm, I am trying to implement a jquery-ui accordian. I have the example working fine on a standalone page, but, when I try and implement it into an exisitng page, where the content is dynamic, it fails. When I look at the source of the example the tags have been changed, from <div id="accordion"> to <div id="accordion" class="ui-accordion ui-widget ui-helper-reset" role="tablist"> but the dynamic stuff isn't being changed, and I suspect that's what
[17:29:18] <shoky> `demo @ b0nn
[17:29:18] <b-ot> b0nn: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:32:05] <b0nn> shoky: I wish I could, however we're talking about several java files + jQuery + css
[17:32:24] <b0nn> and I'm not sure how a dynamic example can be whipped up
[17:32:41] <shoky> then i'm not sure how it's possible to help
[17:32:59] <b0nn> I can pastebin the yeah
[17:33:10] <b0nn> I can pastebin the java that creates the dynamic content
[17:33:20] <b0nn> and then perhaps link you to my page?
[17:33:32] <shoky> so you have a link..?
[17:33:50] <b0nn> yeah... but that's not going to show you if I've broken it at the backend :)
[17:34:03] <shoky> are you asking about the backend?
[17:34:11] <b0nn> at this point I don't know
[17:34:11] <shoky> cause this is #jquery
[17:34:14] <b0nn> yes
[17:34:27] <shoky> well. go on then ;p
[17:34:31] <b0nn> but if the backend is sending html that is not expected
[17:34:37] <b0nn> ok
[17:34:41] <shoky> then pastebin the html
[17:34:43] <shoky> not the java..
[17:34:59] <b0nn> ok :)
[17:35:18] <b0nn> doh!
[17:35:23] <b0nn> html :http://shanehowearth.com/tomcat/CelestialCalculations/archive.html
[17:36:11] <b0nn> html :http://shanehowearth.com/Archive.html <<-- working example
[17:36:27] <shoky> 404
[17:36:47] <shoky> on the 2nd one
[17:37:00] <b0nn> ya, sorry http://shanehowearth.com/Accordian.html
[17:37:43] <b0nn> and just the domain will get you the page where it doesn't work, there is expected an accordian in the bottom Right Hand corner
[17:37:51] <shoky> it's not loading.. breakpoint in your java?
[17:38:09] <shoky> or something
[17:38:11] <Velveeta> i got the accordian page to load
[17:38:22] <b0nn> hm, shouldn't be any issues
[17:38:45] <Velveeta> however, i don't see any javascript in this page that's trying to instantiate an accordian
[17:38:47] <shoky> it's not loading the .js files
[17:38:50] <Velveeta> just the markup output
[17:38:52] <Velveeta> right
[17:39:06] <Velveeta> wb dexx1_
[17:39:12] <shoky> b0nn: anyway, not sure which page you're asking about, and what are you asking
[17:39:12] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: hold up..
[17:39:12] <b0nn> ok, the .js is loaded on the main page, is that an issue?
[17:39:16] <Dexx1_> let me paste
[17:39:39] <Velveeta> ok i see it now
[17:39:40] <asmendes> On http://shanehowearth.com/tomcat/CelestialCalculations/archive.html, wheres the jquery import?
[17:39:50] <b0nn> shoky: ok http://shanehowerath.com <<-- bottom right hand corner should be an accordian built using the archive data
[17:40:04] <b0nn> er shanehowearth.com
[17:40:38] <shoky> it's not loading..
[17:40:46] <b0nn> ?
[17:40:53] <shoky> pending on a .css and .js file
[17:41:10] <b0nn> huh
[17:41:11] <shoky> can't see the page
[17:41:23] <b0nn> that's really weird
[17:41:49] <b0nn> is http://shanehowearth.com choking for anyone else?
[17:42:31] <shoky> now just main.css isn't loading
[17:42:52] <b0nn> I've never had this problem
[17:42:55] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: http://jsbin.com/IbUyEzo/1/
[17:43:33] <Velveeta> dexx1_: there's nothing on that page for me
[17:43:47] <Velveeta> there we go, i had to click to edit it
[17:43:56] <Dexx1_> k
[17:44:01] <Velveeta> this is the original code
[17:44:37] <b0nn> shoky: still not loading?
[17:45:06] <shoky> b0nn: nope
[17:45:16] <b0nn> hm
[17:45:20] <b0nn> not sure what to say
[17:45:45] <shoky> weird that's it's just on one css file.. no idea ;p
[17:46:01] <b0nn> well, that file is shanehowearth.com/main.css
[17:46:24] <b0nn> but I don't understand why it's not being served
[17:46:24] <shoky> yep, can't load that
[17:46:53] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: yea. I am doing it again. So what is the first tip?
[17:47:06] <shoky> `down http://shanehowearth.com/main.css
[17:47:06] <b-ot> shoky: It's just you. http://shanehowearth.com/main.css is up! (200 OK)
[17:47:11] <shoky> ;S
[17:47:29] <Velveeta> dexx1_: one second, i'm rewriting this
[17:47:30] <shoky> `down http://shanehowearth.com/main.cssss
[17:47:31] <b-ot> shoky: It's not just you! http://shanehowearth.com/main.cssss is down! (404 Not Found)
[17:47:37] <Dexx1_> k
[17:47:53] <shoky> is it just me ?
[17:48:04] <b0nn> `paste
[17:48:04] <b-ot> b0nn: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:48:44] <b0nn> http://fixee.org/paste/itt8or4/
[17:48:48] <b0nn> ^^main.css
[17:49:05] <shoky> b0nn yeh that's not the issue tho.. i can't see the page, so can't see the problem in action
[17:49:32] <b0nn> yeah, that's a little perplexing
[17:49:32] <shoky> so far i could only fully load your first link  http://shanehowearth.com/tomcat/CelestialCalculations/archive.html
[17:49:44] <shoky> but i dono if you were asking about this one
[17:50:01] <b0nn> yeah, that's the html to be loaded into a div, there's no js or css coming in with that
[17:50:17] <shoky> to be loaded into a div? how?
[17:50:47] <b0nn>   $.ajax({
[17:50:47] <b0nn>     type: "POST",
[17:50:47] <b0nn>     url: 'tomcat/CelestialCalculations/archive.html',
[17:50:47] <b0nn>     data: {type: "frontPage"},
[17:50:47] <b0nn>     success: function(msg){
[17:50:49] <b0nn>       $('div#accordian').html(msg);
[17:50:53] <b0nn>     }oops not k C!!
[17:51:29] <b0nn> this loads the page up http://fixee.org/paste/li1ucb6/
[17:51:52] <shoky> why are you sticking that <script> into a div?
[17:52:16] <b0nn> because I wasn't sure if it was being triggered when I put it into the head
[17:52:36] <b0nn> I was concerned that the page would load, run that script, then load the content
[17:52:50] <Velveeta> dexx1_: ok, this is more like what it should look like, but there are still problems with it that only you can solve: http://jsbin.com/IbUyEzo/2/edit
[17:53:35] <shoky> b0nn: it'd be best to initialize the accordion in the ajax success callback, after updating the DOM
[17:53:49] <Velveeta> dexx1_: for one thing, in the 2nd part where you're constructing your data rows, you're iterating over "object" which hasn't been defined anywhere in this snippet
[17:53:50] <b0nn> oh, that's a good idea
[17:53:56] <shoky> b0nn: but yeh this is hard to debug without seeing it :\
[17:54:23] <Velveeta> dexx1_: another thing is that this is only good for a 1-row data section, unless you use a nested loop to a) construct each row and b) construct each cell within that row
[17:55:09] <shoky> Velveeta: does it load for you? http://shanehowearth.com/main.css
[17:55:09] <Dexx1_> hmm
[17:55:14] <b0nn> hm, putting that into the success wasn't the quickj fix :(
[17:55:38] <Velveeta> shoky: yepyep
[17:55:54] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: is yours supposed to work?
[17:55:57] <Dexx1_> (even a little)
[17:56:06] <shoky> oh
[17:56:25] <Velveeta> dexx1_: not even a little… there's no url defined in that snippet you provided.. you just provided a variable called url, which is undefined
[17:56:32] <shoky> b0nn: i see you're also initializing the accordion in a separate script in <head>
[17:56:42] <shoky> b0nn: you should only initialize it once
[17:56:49] <b0nn> yes, sorry, I've tried two approaches (now three)
[17:56:55] <b0nn> I'll remove the two bung ones
[17:57:23] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I meant..assuming it's defined
[17:58:01] <Velveeta> dexx1_: seeing as it's untested code, i can't say that it should work at all, like i said, you're also iterating over an object called "object" which doesn't seem to be defined anywhere
[17:58:18] <inokios> http://www.theweeklypay.com/index.php?share=19844/
[17:58:24] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: improved. I get:  courseName	description	startDate	endDate as output
[17:58:40] <Velveeta> so it sounds like the header is at least working maybe
[17:59:00] <Velveeta> but you need to fix the section that constructs the data portion of it, "object" isn't defined anywhere in that function
[17:59:00] <shoky> b0nn: er your html is also not in the format needed for accordion..
[17:59:02] <Dexx1_> yea.. let me try to figure it out
[17:59:09] <Dexx1_> true. i'll look at object
[17:59:12] <Velveeta> it should presumably be some member of the json object coming back in the response, "data"
[18:00:10] <b0nn> shoky: if you mean the href=# stuffs, I've removed it now
[18:00:33] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I get something like: http://pastie.org/private/emvjx3dxbea4eyevo2cura --- the "object" was supposed to be "data"
[18:00:38] <shoky> b0nn: no not that
[18:00:53] <Dexx1_> because I see: $.getJSON(url, function (data) {
[18:00:58] <Dexx1_> that's not the declaration is it
[18:01:09] <b0nn> oh, ok, what?
[18:01:19] <dcope> what's the preferred way to have an instance variable in js?
[18:01:26] <shoky> b0nn: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/   read the top paragraph and html
[18:01:46] <Velveeta> dexx1_: ok, so now you're getting output of [object Object] for your td's, and that's because the "value" that's being inserted into each of those td's is an actual js object instead of a string property
[18:02:12] <Velveeta> dexx1_: so it's gonna be up to you to determine what actually needs to be inserted into those td's and do it properly
[18:02:16] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: interesting.
[18:02:27] <Velveeta> dcope: are you talking about something like: var foo = new Foo(); // ?
[18:02:52] <Velveeta> dexx1_: do you know how to use the js console and debugger to step through your code?
[18:02:56] <b0nn> sorry, I'm not seeing it, I have H3, then the immediate child is div, don't I?
[18:03:06] <shoky> b0nn: immediate child?
[18:03:17] <b0nn> er, next sibling
[18:03:18] <dcope> Velveeta: well i just need to make a variable accessible across all functions in my js on a single page
[18:03:20] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: sort of.
[18:03:23] <Dexx1_> Done it once or twice
[18:03:29] <shoky> b0nn: right, and what about the next sibling?
[18:03:41] <b0nn> Oh
[18:03:44] <b0nn> I see your point
[18:04:08] <Velveeta> dcope: ok, so you're talking about scoping then… if it has to be available across all functions (presumably across multiple files? ) then you'll want to assign it to the window namespace… so something like: window.foo = true;
[18:04:12] <b0nn> so it needs the content for each header to be encapsulated within ONE tag
[18:04:40] <Velveeta> dexx1_: well you'll want to take a crack at it again, you can add this to the top of your callback function, before var headerRow: debugger;
[18:04:48] <shoky> b0nn: yep
[18:04:56] <Velveeta> that'll force it to hit a breakpoint in your debugger, and let you examine the contents of "data"
[18:05:30] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: i'll try thanks
[18:05:39] <dcope> Velveeta: yeah, i figured it out
[18:05:41] <dcope> interesting...
[18:05:47] <Velveeta> dexx1_: no problem, also, what browser are you testing this in?
[18:07:35] <shoky> why tf can't i load this one css file :SSS
[18:08:05] <Velveeta> i have no clue, that's weird, because it loaded for me on the first try
[18:08:19] <Velveeta> but the other weird thing is that his main site didn't about 15 minutes ago when i first tried, but it loads now
[18:08:24] <shoky> another css file loads fine  :\
[18:08:30] <Velveeta> sounds almost like intermittent dns issues
[18:08:32] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: chrome
[18:09:03] <Velveeta> dexx1_: then from the js console, when it hits the debugger statement, you can type this: dir(data)
[18:09:30] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: before headerRow, I just put this: debugger; -- right?
[18:09:39] <Velveeta> and it'll print out a nice little bundled up version of that object that you can expand, expand severl of its properties, and you can copy/paste that into another pastebin or something and i can maybe help you figure out what you need to be iterating over for your table records
[18:09:54] <Velveeta> dexx1_: yepyep, the first line of the callback for that request
[18:10:09] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: in console you want me to type: dir(data) ?
[18:10:13] <Velveeta> yep
[18:10:35] <Velveeta> then expand it and a few of its properties and copy and paste that into a pastebin or something for me to look at
[18:10:50] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: http://pastie.org/8451457
[18:11:13] <b0nn> shoky: :( Still no joy
[18:11:15] <Velveeta> can you repaste the code you have as your current javascript?
[18:11:23] <Velveeta> i thought you were receiving 'data' as a parameter in your callback
[18:11:40] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I am X_x
[18:11:49] <Velveeta> well, show me the current javascript you have in place
[18:11:56] <shoky> b0nn:  you've got some </br/>'s  and a <</div>   ;p
[18:11:57] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: http://pastie.org/private/ro9iwtprsayr4sskio2lpw
[18:12:09] <b0nn> do the page breaks have to go?
[18:12:19] <b0nn> and yeah, I removed the offending <
[18:12:24] <Velveeta> dexx1_: there's no debugger statement in that pastie
[18:12:25] <shoky> no, just the slash in front
[18:12:34] <Erneston> hi
[18:12:34] <Velveeta> is this your *current* js?
[18:12:37] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I have it added.... just not in that pastie
[18:12:40] <Dexx1_> yea current
[18:12:50] <Velveeta> so what line do you have the debugger statement on?
[18:13:03] <Velveeta> just inside of the $.getJSON call?
[18:13:08] <Erneston> http://jsfiddle.net/RmP49/66/ <----- trying to get the orange element to move up 4 times only
[18:13:16] <Erneston> 1 per each paragrah
[18:13:17] <shoky> b0nn:  accordian/accordion
[18:13:25] <shoky> b0nn: in your .js file
[18:13:40] <shoky> stick to one spelling, preferably the correct one ;p
[18:13:58] <Velveeta> erneston: you're not clearing your setInterval function anywhere to tell it to stop moving up
[18:14:19] <Velveeta> dexx1_: Velveeta: so what line do you have the debugger statement on?
[18:14:20] <Velveeta> [8:13pm] Velveeta: just inside of the $.getJSON call?
[18:14:23] <shoky> b0nn: and in your main html
[18:14:31] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: right before headerRow
[18:14:35] <b0nn> IT WAS THE A
[18:14:43] <b0nn> aweseome, thanks
[18:14:50] <shoky> ;p
[18:14:55] <b0nn> next time I'll use words I can speel propa :)
[18:15:05] <Velveeta> dexx1_: and when you did that dir(data) from the console, did you do it after the debugger had paused on that line? or did you just open the console and type that at some random time?
[18:15:35] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I hit the PLAY button the debugger, then I ran it
[18:15:37] <Erneston> oky let me look into this
[18:15:42] <Velveeta> don't hit the play button
[18:15:42] <Dexx1_> should I run it _without_ pressing play
[18:15:46] <Dexx1_> oh ok
[18:15:47] <Velveeta> rightio
[18:15:48] <Dexx1_> let me try
[18:16:06] <shoky> b0nn: btw you can just do $('#accordion').html(msg).accordion();
[18:16:25] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: ah ok. here we go: http://pastie.org/8451469
[18:16:44] <b0nn> shoky: Thanks again, I'll use that line
[18:17:02] <shoky> np
[18:17:09] <Velveeta> dexx1_: ok, so then my question now is, you're iterating over data[0] for your header row, is it safe to assume that data[1] .. data[N] hold the contents of your actual table data?
[18:17:29] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: yea
[18:17:35] <b0nn> Are there any restrictions on the content tags, I was hoping to make each a link
[18:17:55] <Velveeta> dexx1_: ok, then let me do some more modifications to show you how to proceed
[18:18:01] <Dexx1_> k
[18:18:10] <shoky> b0nn: it's best to leave them as divs.. you can put whatever you want inside, e.g. a link
[18:18:48] <b0nn> ok, and then decorate the links as I like in css. Cool, makes sense.
[18:19:13] <Velveeta> dexx1_: try something like this: http://jsbin.com/IbUyEzo/3/edit
[18:20:32] <Velveeta> dexx1_: just for your edification, there's a call to data.shift(), which will remove the first record from the object after we're done with it for the header row, and then we iterate over the data object for each record, and iterate over each record for the values to insert into the td's
[18:20:42] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: I thought I needed to add a loop like $.each(data, function(index, value) {     				$.each(value, function () {}.... ...append($row)) in line 10
[18:21:33] <Velveeta> dexx1_: oh yes, you're right, i missed that, one sec
[18:21:41] <Velveeta> good catch, it shows you're paying attention ;)
[18:22:03] <Dexx1_> _trying_ to pay attention
[18:22:28] <Velveeta> heheheh
[18:22:35] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: btw, output looks good. It just looks fugly and shows just the first row
[18:22:41] <Velveeta> dexx1_: http://jsbin.com/IbUyEzo/3/edit
[18:23:11] <Erneston> http://jsfiddle.net/RmP49/67/ <--- cant get the bloody element to stop
[18:23:38] <Velveeta> dexx1_: now, also for your learning process, you should know that appending to the dom in a loop like that is fairly inefficient… it'll be better if you append to a string of html and inject the whole string at one time, or else append to a document fragment, and then append the fragment at one time to the document
[18:23:48] <Dexx1_> wtf nothing shows anymore
[18:24:23] <Velveeta> dexx1_: sounds like there's an error somewhere then, what does your console show?
[18:24:40] <Velveeta> ernestone: you're trying to make it move up 4 times, or the-number-of-paragraphs times?
[18:25:35] <Dexx1_> Velveeta: yea you are right. Still one row and second row repeats on the same first row
[18:26:00] <Velveeta> dexx1_: can you show a new pastie?
[18:27:00] <Dexx1_> http://pastie.org/private/ulkuc9lyicilfz3f7h80g
[18:29:49] <Velveeta> oh whoops, i see the problem
[18:30:45] <Velveeta> here you go, try this: http://jsbin.com/IbUyEzo/4/edit
[18:40:18] <Erneston> i think i solved it
[18:41:16] <Erneston> http://jsfiddle.net/RmP49/68/
[18:41:24] <Erneston> please check if this works on your chrome too
[18:42:43] <Velveeta> yep, works for me
[18:42:58] <Erneston> how could i improve the coding?
[18:43:02] <Erneston> it looks a mess
[18:43:52] <Velveeta> not sure.. i'm on my 2nd dixie cup of irish whiskey at this point, so while i'm still perfectly able to debug, optimizing isn't exactly in my current skillset ;)
[18:50:23] <esmic> velveeta need help with some newbie stuff
[18:50:26] <esmic> halp!
[18:50:58] <Velveeta> NO CARRIER
[18:51:10] <Velveeta> what's up? :)
[18:53:08] <esmic> if else statements .( want div toshow 1, if number is lower than 1 http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/NTrjJ/
[18:55:09] <Velveeta> this is a pretty incomplete jsfiddle… what's the actual question?
[18:56:54] <cusco> esmic: where does the asd variable comfrom?
[19:00:18] <esmic> sec
[19:03:57] <esmic> basically im trying describe if var drop below 1 the output to the div is 1 http://jsfiddle.net/esmica/NTrjJ/2/ the syntax is wrong
[19:04:30] <Velveeta> #asd isn't a form element… it doesn't fire a change event
[19:04:47] <Velveeta> you're also missing a closing parentheses on that change event
[19:11:08] <t3ch> Can anyone tell me what happens when I execute an ajax call that creates html with a javascript function for an onclick listener and inserts it into a page.  I then add the onclick event listerner after it's loaded.  When I click the object that has been loaded dynamically, after attaching the onclick listener to the function, the html output gives me "[object mouseevent]"
[19:11:25] <t3ch> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19748349/ajax-request-generates-html-with-potential-for-subsequent-ajax-requests-seconda
[19:11:36] <t3ch> that's the example above..
[19:12:13] <Velveeta> is that your post?
[19:12:21] <Velveeta> and by that i mean is that your code?
[19:12:28] <t3ch> i want to have an ajax call generate html with an onclick event attached to it.  when I click the generated element, it needs to fire another ajax call.
[19:12:36] <t3ch> yeah..
[19:12:42] <Velveeta> there's no jquery in it...
[19:13:13] <t3ch> i know, but this is a place where I knew people would be and that understand javascript better than I do.
[19:13:59] <Velveeta> be that as it may, i feel compelled to throw out a disclaimer that this isn't a generic javascript help channel
[19:14:12] <Velveeta> is there a reason you're not using jquery for your ajax handling in this example?
[19:14:21] <cusco> there is a javascript channel in this network
[19:14:44] <t3ch> the first call works fine and generates output and puts it into the document.  It looks normal as well, but when I click the inserted object, it makes it out to be an object as opposed to a variable string
[19:15:23] <t3ch> where might that be cusco?
[19:15:58] <cusco> when I type /j javascript I get forwarded to ##javascript
[19:16:20] <t3ch> thanks
[19:18:13] <relipse> does anyone know how to make divs draggable and droppable into widget areas
[19:18:20] <relipse> essentially dockable divs
[19:33:43] <winsoff> >>document.write('lol');
[19:33:51] <winsoff> No jquerybot?
[19:34:32] <pixelpimp> if there were, he'd probably yell at you for there being no document (it's IRC) and that using document.write() is very 1995
[19:35:06] <pixelpimp> now if you had said $('#jquery').text('lol'), that might be a bit more correct
[19:37:35] <winsoff> pixelpimp: I just wanted to see if it would do anything ;-;
[19:37:59] <pixelpimp> >> 4
[19:38:09] <pixelpimp> i thought there was a bot in here
[19:38:29] <pixelpimp> there's one in ##javascript but i doubt it'd do anything with document.write()
[19:39:09] <Velveeta> there is a bot in here, but i don't think it responds to >>
[19:39:18] <pixelpimp> yeah
[19:39:24] <pixelpimp> certainly one to look up api stuff
[19:39:29] <Velveeta> right
[19:40:50] <winsoff> It does, Velveeta
[19:40:52] <winsoff> Oh
[19:40:59] <winsoff> I thought you meant a bot in ##javascript
[19:41:09] <Velveeta> oh gotcha, no, the one in here :)
[19:41:30] <winsoff> {choice=4;doof()}
[19:41:35] <winsoff> Nope.
[19:41:41] <winsoff> eval choice=4;doof()
[19:41:43] <winsoff> Nope.
[19:41:48] <Velveeta> `api text @ winsoff
[19:41:48] <b-ot> winsoff: .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[19:42:25] <winsoff> What advantage is jquery over javascript?
[19:43:10] <Velveeta> an abstracted api to accomplish more complicated tasks like animation, ajax, and dom manipulation/traversal, as well as handling cross-browser compatibility
[19:43:10] <winsoff> `semicolons
[19:43:24] <winsoff> Velveeta, so more of a browser-centric javascript
[19:43:35] <winsoff> Since javascript was not necessarily completely tied to the "web"
[19:43:38] <Velveeta> definitely, it gives you a centralized api to code to
[19:43:44] <winsoff> Ah, okay.
[19:43:52] <Velveeta> and internally, it implements various cross-browser differences
[19:44:06] <winsoff> Does that help with HTML5-without-standards coding?
[19:44:21] <winsoff> Or does it not interface much with the HTML5/CSS3 standards?
[19:44:25] <winsoff> sorry; "standards"
[19:44:45] <Velveeta> it's strictly a js layer, are you talking about nonstandard html5 markup and css3 properties?
[19:45:09] <t3ch> no one in javascript seems to have any suggestions...
[19:45:16] <winsoff> You said cross-browser differences, so I interpreted it to mean both javascript AND nonstandard HTML5/CSS3
[19:45:27] <t3ch> any direction would be appreciated..  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19748349/ajax-request-generates-html-with-potential-for-subsequent-ajax-requests-seconda
[19:45:44] <Velveeta> winsoff: no, i mean cross-browser javascript differences, such as things like attachEventListener vs addEventListener
[19:46:10] <Velveeta> t3ch: i would suggest implementing that ajax call in jquery
[19:46:21] <winsoff> Ah, okay.
[19:46:41] <Velveeta> winsoff: so things where various js engines differ, jquery helps provide a simplified consistent api that you can code to
[19:46:41] <t3ch> Velveeta: why can't i do it that way?
[19:47:18] <Velveeta> in addition, it helps abstract away various tasts like dom manipulation and traversal, letting you do things like $('div.content').find('.green').css('padding', '10px');
[19:47:33] <Velveeta> t3ch: do it which way?
[19:47:33] <t3ch> the first call results in an html element that has onclick="function(var);"  when i click it, var is turned into [object mouseevent]
[19:47:56] <t3ch> modestginger, i'm looping the created elements .
[19:48:32] <Velveeta> t3ch: i know what you've said previously, but the snippet you've shown has a lot of missing pieces to it
[19:48:51] <t3ch> dynamiccall is the first event.  it generates an html element that has onclick="getubilling(uid)";  when i click that element the uid goes from the number to [object mouseevent]
[19:49:13] <Velveeta> you have function expressions that aren't shown anywhere in your code sample except to say that they're assigned to the onclick property
[19:50:00] <Velveeta> you're using nonstandard attributes also, btw, to determine what to assign to those, and since those aren't if/else statements, it's possible that something to trigger true on multiple if conditions, and your onclick would be overwritten by other attribute matches
[19:50:07] <t3ch> the handle response function simply gets a container by id and inserts the html into it with  document.getElementById('initiative').innerHTML = response;
[19:51:57] <t3ch> I followed this example to initialize the inserted functions... http://toddmotto.com/attaching-event-handlers-to-dynamically-created-javascript-elements/
[19:52:19] <t3ch> mind you, the functions these call are loaded when the page is first loaded, they aren't dynamically inserted into the document.
[19:52:47] <Velveeta> you know, if you did this with jquery, you could probably chop the number of lines of code down to 1/3 of what you have here, and actually have it work properly
[19:53:03] <t3ch> My rationale is that if the function is defined when the page first loads, and I insert an element into the page with an onclick='' event inline, when i click it, it should work.
[19:53:55] <t3ch> baby steps velveeta
[19:55:33] <Velveeta> baby steps are all well and good, but as has been previously stated, this is a channel for assistance in jquery itself, not general javascript help
[20:21:27] <mikemcchillin> Anyone have experience writing a Chrome Extension?
[20:42:24] <RonWhoCares> How do I uncheck this using jQuery? <input type="checkbox" id="required_for_breakthrough_pain">
[20:43:15] <pixelpimp> $('#required_...').attr('checked', false)
[20:43:28] <pixelpimp> .prop() should also work
[20:57:09] <Velveeta> yeah, .prop is what you should use for that case, like pixelpimp said
[21:01:17] <MACscr> if i have a button within a column of a table and i want to do find all inputs with a particular name within that table, shouldnt i do something like so? var checkBoxes = $(this).parent("table").find("input[name=delete]");
[21:01:29] <MACscr> $(this) being the button
[21:01:55] <Velveeta> yeah, sounds about right
[21:04:02] <MACscr> hmm, im not getting an error, but its working. It works fine if i simply do var checkBoxes = $("input[name=delete]"); but then that does it for the entire page
[21:04:21] <MACscr> i just want it within that particular table the button is in
[21:04:47] <pixelpimp> you want .parents()
[21:04:52] <pixelpimp> .parent() is only one level up
[21:05:35] <MACscr> ah, thanks! that works
[21:10:53] <digitaloc> hello everyone
[21:22:28] <Velveeta> just out of curiosity, does everybody know what goes great on a turkey and cheese sammich? ……….because the correct answer is sriracha...
[21:25:06] <MACscr> ok, im having more brain farts. Why isnt my delete check all button working here? http://jsfiddle.net/NDxNY/12/
[21:40:07] <MACscr> nvm, i got it resolved
[21:42:32] <digitaloc> how's it going MAC?
[21:52:24] <MACscr> not to bad, yourself?
[21:53:59] <digitaloc> doing alright i guess....trying to build a frontend data entry form for my job
[21:54:04] <digitaloc> i figure i would use jquery
[21:54:26] <Velveeta> i can +1 that decision for you
[21:54:45] <digitaloc> ?
[21:54:51] <digitaloc> what can you add
[21:54:54] <Svetlana> +1 means 'support', 'encourage'
[21:54:57] <digitaloc> oh
[21:54:58] <digitaloc> lol ok
[21:55:06] <Velveeta> :)
[21:55:25] <Svetlana> ref https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google_introduces_the_'+1'_button
[21:55:34] <digitaloc> so pretty much i am developing some forms for a distrubtion company
[21:56:01] <digitaloc> we hire independent contractor to deliver products
[21:56:28] <digitaloc> so i have to make a form that can add drivers to the database
[21:56:59] <digitaloc> so pretty much i'm building a profile
[21:57:12] <digitaloc> then under the profiles there would be two sub-profiles
[21:57:25] <digitaloc> 1 would be drivers and the other would be vehicles
[22:06:38] <digitaloc> any good resource out there for forms designs?
[23:28:24] <eltigre> Hi, I am using jquery mobile, and I have a navigation structure on the left side of every page... is there a way I can exempt these elements from page transitions?
