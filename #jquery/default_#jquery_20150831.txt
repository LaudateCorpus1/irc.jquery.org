[00:00:01] <vinex08> hi, i do have a sticky header effect here... http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/  but i want the blue box to appear when the pink box reaches the top
[00:02:16] <Cork> vinex08: http://jsfiddle.net/uhm26em1/4/
[00:05:20] <vinex08> Cork: imsorry if my explanation is bad,.. i dont want to fully hide the blue box. i still want it to show at top when its bottom reaches the browser cieling
[00:08:40] <vinex08> i can do it by adjust the '260' number ... but ill have problem with mobile versions
[00:09:33] <vinex08> if i could just set it to 'when the pink box touches the browser cieling, that's the time the bluebox will position fixed'
[00:13:02] <Cork> vinex08: do what, you're kinda light on the details
[00:13:28] <Cork> is the real question how to get the offset from the element instead of having a static number=
[00:13:32] <Cork> *?
[00:14:18] <vinex08> Yeah, couldnt explain better.. my english is getting really bad :) by i was able to solve it :)
[00:14:32] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/5/
[00:14:44] <vinex08> jsut got the codes from google
[00:18:28] <vinex08> now i want to i slowly appear should i use transition css?
[00:18:44] <vinex08> now i want it** to
[00:30:33] <tty> hi all. i am trying to use this http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/ but i can’t get any of the examples to work. any ideas?
[00:30:46] <tty> clicking a thumbnail keeps opening an image.
[00:31:37] <Cork> tty: make sure you don't get any js errors
[00:31:40] <Cork> works fine here
[00:32:45] <tty> Cork: i get “Uncaught TypeError: a is not a function” on jquery.magnific-popup.min.js
[00:33:26] <Cork> in what browser?
[00:34:31] <tty> chrome
[00:34:43] <Cork> then try with your extensions disabled
[00:35:40] <tty> Cork: Same thing
[00:36:26] <Cork> well you would have to diagnose that yourself
[00:36:34] <Cork> it works fine here in chromium and firefox
[00:38:39] <tty> Cork: This is my html http://pastebin.com/SAMf1dvT
[00:39:07] <Cork> didn't you said there examples doesn't work?
[00:39:16] <tty> i am trying the “Single image lightbox” found here http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/
[00:39:17] <Cork> why would i need a pastbin?
[00:39:37] <tty> Cork: maybe i am missing something not obvious
[00:39:55] <Cork> if there examples doesn't work for you it means you have a problem with your browser
[00:40:07] <Cork> giving me the working code again won't help
[00:41:54] <tty> Cork: sure.
[01:09:31] <SporeD3V> hello
[01:09:51] <SporeD3V> could you please take a look at this question? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32305987/show-hide-and-slider-conflict
[01:27:06] <SporeD3V> anybody willing to help with a problem?
[01:50:18] <wa5ted> SporeD3V: what problem
[01:51:42] <SporeD3V> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32305987/show-hide-and-slider-conflict this one
[01:52:01] <Cork> SporeD3V: you've already asked the so compunity wait for them to answer it
[01:52:47] <SporeD3V> there's been almost 2 hours since i asked... 34 visits... no good answer
[01:53:03] <SporeD3V> 38 visits*
[01:53:08] <Cork> SporeD3V: well so ask it here if you want, but don't just link to the so page
[01:53:35] <Cork> (cause most ppl will just ignore it)
[01:53:42] <SporeD3V> ah ok
[01:54:00] <SporeD3V> thing is that I have a simple show/hide div script
[01:54:15] <SporeD3V> the divs that need to be shown or hidden contain a slider
[01:54:40] <SporeD3V> my guess is since both the show/hide div and the slider use display:none there is a conflict
[01:54:55] <SporeD3V> http://theworkshop.ro/astra3/ this is the link to the site, the work section
[01:55:03] <Cork> uh by slider to you mean a slider or a slideshow?
[01:55:21] <SporeD3V> a content slider, containing text and a image
[01:55:28] <Cork> so a slideshow
[01:55:38] <SporeD3V> :D yeah, i guess
[01:56:39] <SporeD3V> i commented the .page {display:none;} now and I can see all 4 slideshows when i open the page
[01:56:55] <SporeD3V> if i uncomment it nothing displays anymore
[01:57:00] <SporeD3V> in that box i mean
[01:58:19] <Cork> SporeD3V: uh <image id="image" src="images/logo_white.png" class="image img-fix" /> <-- i think you mean img here :)
[01:59:26] <Cork> SporeD3V: you think you could create a reduced test case of this? (on jsfiddle)
[01:59:50] <Cork> it is quite a lot to dig through to understand what happens; and to be honest it would take more them then i can give it
[02:00:13] <SporeD3V> not really, the flicker slider is a long ass script, if you want i can provide the ftp details
[02:01:02] <Cork> no, that would mean even more work to understand what happens
[02:01:28] <Cork> you might be able to find someone with lots of free time on there hands, but i have to back off
[02:01:38] <SporeD3V> ok, tyvm anyway!! :)
[02:02:00] <Cork> SporeD3V: i can say one thing though
[02:02:15] <Cork> i suspect that the script is asking for the sizes of the elements in the plugin
[02:02:33] <Cork> and as those elements are inside a parent with display: none, they won't calculate (browser optimizations)
[02:02:44] <Cork> and that is probably why things break
[02:03:19] <Cork> another reason might be that the plugin just expects to be visible and breaks if it doesn't control everything (this wouldn't surprise me as slideshow plugins tend to be VERY badly written)
[02:03:35] <Kartagis> I hate the error Unexpected token <
[02:04:00] <Cork> Kartagis: it just means you gave html to something that expected a css selector
[02:04:15] <Cork> $.parseHTML is you're friend
[02:04:16] <SporeD3V> hmm... i guess it's the second case
[02:06:45] <Kartagis> Cork: so the problem is in one of my js files
[02:06:50] <Cork> yes
[02:07:35] <Cork> Kartagis: basically they've reduced the sniffing jquery does for $()
[02:07:55] <Cork> so unless the first few characters looks like html it assumes it is a selector now days
[02:08:08] <Cork> and $.parseHTML was introduced in 1.9 for this reason
[02:08:17] <Cork> it will always expect html
[02:08:39] <Cork> and result in a dom tree so $() won't have to guess
[02:10:47] <Kartagis> okay, the problem is in apply.js
[02:11:04] <Kartagis> Cork: could you take a quick look?
[02:11:55] <Cork> $(html) => $($.parseHTML(html))
[02:12:01] <Cork> that is the change you need to do
[02:23:48] <Kartagis> what will this do in my code? I understand it's for breaking it into array
[02:25:50] <Cork> Kartagis: no it isn't for breaking it into arrays
[02:26:14] <Cork> it changes so instead of implicitly parse the html it explicitly parses it
[02:38:50] <Kartagis> let me ask something
[02:39:29] <Kartagis> in login.html I login the user and set some vars upon successful login
[02:39:59] <Kartagis> then redirect to another html which src's a javascript file
[02:40:31] <Kartagis> would I be able to use the vars I set in the js file?
[03:24:48] <mhl> .
[03:55:49] <Cork> Kartagis: no, the environment will be unloaded so all the variables will be lost
[04:14:06] <ebbflowgo> looking here: http://codepen.io/rmarinac89/pen/vNBqJx   trying to click the paragraph HELLO and select input.myCheckbox not sure why it's not working
[04:15:01] <taplar> CheckBox
[04:15:06] <taplar> selector is doing Checkbox
[04:17:19] <ebbflowgo> taplar: ??
[04:18:54] <lemonsparrow> can someone help me figure out why this spec is failing https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/d81b9999140f59c81fb3
[04:19:25] <taplar> ebbflowgo: you have your input with class 'myCheckBox' but your selector is looking for 'input.myCheckbox'
[04:19:30] <taplar> case matters in selectors
[04:20:05] <ebbflowgo> taplar: oh, haha
[04:20:06] <ebbflowgo> thanks!

[04:36:17] <eksent> Hello everyone!
[04:38:04] <eksent> A little bit of a novice question: I'm learning html/css and I want to add a range slider with jQuery but I'm having a hard time adding the language to my index file.
[04:38:19] <taplar> Kartagis: using dataType: 'json' i think the data your giving it is not valid.  try setting data as { username: ..., password: ... }
[04:38:28] <taplar> it should do the encoding for you
[04:39:00] <eksent> Can anyone help me set up jQuery properly?
[04:39:20] <taplar> eksent: so your trying to include jquery on your page?
[04:39:25] <eksent> yes
[04:39:31] <Kartagis> eksent: <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/jquery"></script>
[04:39:51] <Kartagis> eksent: <script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script>
[04:40:20] <eksent> do i add this in <head> of html or in <body>?
[04:40:28] <taplar> eksent: either will work
[04:40:40] <taplar> it just needs to be before any other script that uses jquery
[04:40:52] <eksent> ok
[04:41:00] <eksent> and does it have any conflicts with bootstrap?
[04:41:09] <eksent> if I add it first?
[04:42:12] <taplar> i believe bootstrap and jquery are independent libraries, so i would think not.
[04:43:07] <eksent> ok thank you very much taplar and Kartagis
[04:43:20] <eksent> :)
[04:44:31] <shibly> Hi, may i ask?
[04:44:33] <Kartagis> taplar: you're talking about the 2nd ajax call, right?
[04:44:49] <taplar> Kartagis: yeah, the one that your constructing a key value pairing string
[04:44:53] <Cork> ?ask @ shibly
[04:44:57] <Kartagis> shibly: if it's about jquery, yeah
[04:45:15] <Cork> shibly: don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[04:45:37] <Cork> if it isn't the right channel we can point you to where you should ask it
[04:45:53] <shibly> If there is no data, that means data.length=0 there will be no button(Load More) , how can i do it?
[04:45:56] <shibly> https://bpaste.net/show/142feb0217a8
[04:46:04] <Kartagis> taplar: my structure is like data:{uid:duser.nid}
[04:46:22] <Kartagis> taplar: I think this confirms
[04:46:27] <Kartagis> conforms
[04:46:35] <Kartagis> complies rather
[04:46:57] <Cork> shibly: if(data.length == 0 ) { $('#id_load_more').hide() }
[04:47:06] <Cork> shibly: also don't put tag names infront of ids
[04:47:16] <taplar> Kartagis: uh, line 15
[04:47:50] <Kartagis> taplar: that bir is no issue, that works
[04:47:58] <Kartagis> bit*
[04:48:18] <Kartagis> taplar: look at #28 please
[04:48:19] <taplar> huh
[04:48:52] <Kartagis> taplar: the login part works
[04:50:50] <shibly> How can i hide the button if it is the last record?
[04:50:52] <shibly> Cork: ^
[04:51:25] <shibly> Cork: It displays the "Load More" button if the data is empty
[04:51:36] <shibly> then hides the button
[04:51:53] <Cork> shibly: well how would js know it is the last record?
[04:52:05] <Cork> you have to give that info to js somehow
[04:52:59] <taplar> Kartagis: try putting the dataType:json on #28?
[04:53:44] <taplar> i dunno a valid u and p for that login so i can't get to that part
[04:54:00] <shibly> Cork: How can i send data from php to jquery? through success: function(data){..} callback?
[04:54:08] <Cork> shibly: you can't
[04:54:14] <Cork> it has to be in the content of the response
[04:54:31] <Kartagis> taplar: may I /msg you those?
[04:54:37] <taplar> sure
[04:54:40] <Cork> you appear to be sending html from the server so that is what you have to work with
[04:54:49] <Kartagis> taplar: try tolga and draklor9
[04:55:16] <Cork> shibly: an option is to change the server to send json, then you could have { html: "", lastRecord: true }
[04:55:18] <Cork> or what ever
[04:55:27] <Kartagis> there goes a failed /msg :D
[04:55:56] <taplar> heh, nvm, i can't try it anyway.  it got a cors
[04:57:20] <taplar> oh a side note, i hope in productional code your forcing these requests to go over https
[04:57:25] <taplar> *on a
[04:57:47] <shibly> Cork: Can you please send example code?
[04:57:56] <shibly> Cork: s/send/post
[04:59:01] <Kartagis> taplar: I exclusively set CORS
[04:59:41] <shibly> Cork: What is { html: "", lastRecord: true } ?
[05:00:38] <taplar> Kartagis: i'm still getting it from the user/login.json request
[05:00:43] <Cork> shibly: "<Cork> ...change the server to send json"
[05:01:09] <shibly> Cork: How can i change server? I can't understand.
[05:01:11] <Cork> shibly: so it is just arbitrary json you could have any values you want there
[05:01:21] <Cork> shibly: that would be a ##php question
[05:04:08] <Kartagis> taplar: http://videobin.org/+9rq/czo.html
[05:05:08] <taplar> yeah, dunno why i'm getting it and not you
[05:06:49] <taplar> what was the php question?
[05:07:53] <rindolf> Hi all.

[05:09:46] <rindolf> shibly: sup?

[05:10:21] <rindolf> shibly: nice.
[05:10:31] <rindolf> shibly: are you READY for Rosh Hashanah?
[05:12:59] <shibly> rindolf: What is Rosh Hashanah ?
[05:13:16] <rindolf> shibly: it's the start of the Jewish year.
[05:14:29] <rindolf> shibly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah
[05:15:06] <Splaart> So what kind of weapons do I need for this Rosh Hashanah?
[05:15:41] <rindolf> Splaart: toothpicks! ;-)
[05:16:05] <Splaart> Roger that
[05:16:28] <rindolf> Splaart: they are very useful against vampires.
[05:17:09] <Splaart> Jewish vampires.... There must be a movie about that...
[05:17:41] <taplar> this topic is going in a weird direction...
[05:17:43] <rindolf> Splaart: heh.
[05:18:20] <Splaart> taplar: don't judge me
[06:18:28] <ksman> Hi there. I'm trying to use Defered.promise to lazy load data in fancytree. The data loads works fine but now I'd like to apply a function after the load. Where would I have to put my callback? Right now I have "data.result = dfd.promise();" and "dfd.resolve(functionReturningAList));"
[06:19:42] <taplar> ksman: use done()
[06:20:45] <ksman> taplar:Where exactly?
[06:21:10] <taplar> ksman: you'd attach your done handler before you resolve it
[06:21:21] <taplar> then it gets fired after it is resolved
[06:21:28] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[06:22:05] <ksman> taplar:Yeah, I tried that. But where do I have to  attach the done()?
[06:22:29] <taplar> to your deferred object
[06:24:44] <ksman> taplar: Hm, I tried dfd.done(filterTree); (which is my filter function) but it isn't applied. Let's see again.
[07:38:56] <sgfgdf> hello, guys! i'm using jQuery's to make ajax to cross-domain. the problem i got is with IE9 which returns 'No Transport' error. is there a built-in solution for jQuery or i should use plugin for CORS requests? if yes which plugin is preferable?
[07:43:18] <daynaskully> should i add the async attribute to my jquery script tag? google complains that it's render blocking
[07:44:30] <mentoc> how did you get google to say that?
[07:45:03] <daynaskully> page insights
[07:45:20] <daynaskully> https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
[07:46:57] <mentoc> wow thank you for that
[07:48:24] <daynaskully> google also tells me to put any critical css inline... but all my css is critical.... so i dunno if i should listen to google or not
[07:50:23] <mentoc> I'd probably take that one as a grain of salt
[07:50:42] <ceramicskull> Question is async loading better than combined external js files?
[07:51:25] <Utils> Untested as it's example code but if I'm creating events like in the code where the object created is discarded (maybe via a room closure in a chat) and more rooms are added, would that be an issue? http://pastebin.com/mNJKi5rS
[07:52:23] <ceramicskull> I have a lot of external js files that make my page load time a bit slow (it takes up to 6 seconds sometimes)
[07:55:30] <mentoc> I always think of external js as a security flaw
[07:55:45] <mentoc> erm, maybe not necessarily a "flaw", but more of a concern
[07:55:54] <mentoc> It's a privacy issue.
[07:56:14] <mentoc> there, that's it. Yeah.
[07:57:55] <ceramicskull> mentoc: How would it be a privacy issue?
[07:58:32] <ceramicskull> Also, would this be a better route? http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html
[08:04:47] <Guddu> What can i replace forEach with to iterate a Dictionary? forEach is giving an error on IE :-(
[08:05:19] <ceramicskull> $(selector).each()
[08:18:57] <shoky> sgfgdf: include this  https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[08:22:01] <mentoc> ceramicskull: if someone compromised the external entity, then that code is infecting your page
[08:22:50] <mentoc> ceramicskull: privacy-wise, the external entity can see what page the user is coming from by examining the "referrer" header
[08:27:47] <silverdust> jquery-1.11.* do not support $ ? or is it just me?
[08:28:41] <shoky> just you
[08:29:36] <silverdust> shoky: 1.11.2 keeps giving undefined $ if I use $('stuff')
[08:30:04] <vdeep> silverdust try using $ in web console
[08:31:00] <ceramicskull> Mentoc, but what if the external javascript is already an external entity? Like pixel placements?
[08:31:24] <silverdust> it doesn't work there too. I don't have access to remove the 1.11.2 but after inserting 1.11.3 after it , that works and causes errors in other parts of the code
[08:32:01] <silverdust> It's some old WP theme and I only have a gig to add a feature to it
[08:33:48] <silverdust> using jQuery() in place of $() . Can I have a jQuery(this) because that's where I have problems really
[08:34:19] <silverdust> everywhere I try to use jQuery(this) expecting a $(this) behaviour it just fails
[08:34:51] <robertmaxrees> have an example
[08:35:59] <silverdust> ok I'll link it up. It's online
[08:36:15] <robertmaxrees> the code you're using, not the full page.
[08:39:19] <silverdust> here http://www.sesorafrica.org/i-would-like-to-donate/
[08:39:33] <silverdust> I want you to try $.fn.jquery there
[08:39:42] <robertmaxrees> could you just paste up the relevant code somewhere?
[08:39:44] <silverdust> I'll put my code on jsfiddle
[08:39:47] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[08:40:27] <robertmaxrees> ah - you're running jquery in noconflict mode on that page btw.
[08:40:35] <robertmaxrees> that's why $.fn.jquery is undefined.
[08:45:07] <silverdust> robertmaxrees: jQuery(this) isn't working because I missed a " after a string in that line
[08:45:21] <silverdust> jsfiddle syntax coloring made it clear. I was editing in WP
[08:45:57] <silverdust> You mean because of the jquery-migrate ?
[08:46:23] <Mr21> silverdust: having a problem with jQuery is normal when we are learning ^^, but how it is possible that you are learning and you are making a website with donation/payments?
[08:46:51] <robertmaxrees> silverdust no idea what's setting noconflict.  jquery migrate doesn't do it though
[08:47:08] <silverdust> I'm not learning that way. I'm learning of course but that site is crap and I wasn't the one that built it
[08:47:19] <silverdust> I only have a gig to improve their payment
[08:47:35] <Mr21> silverdust: how right okay ^^
[08:47:49] <Mr21> silverdust: oh.. right okay*
[08:48:00] <silverdust> :)
[09:00:37] <shoky> silverdust:  your wordpress is using a modified jquery that adds a jQuery.noConflict();  to the end
[09:00:51] <robertmaxrees> isn't that a normal wordpress thing?
[09:00:59] <shoky> think so
[09:23:48] <jak2000> hi all

[09:24:36] <rindolf> jak2000: morning.
[09:25:58] <silverdust> I have a var foo in global scope
[09:26:02] <silverdust> oops
[09:26:52] <silverdust> I have a input with type="number" and I'm listening for keyup which is just fine to update what I want. What happens if the user uses controls on number type
[09:27:12] <robertmaxrees> listen for the change event instead.
[09:27:14] <rindolf> silverdust: What do you mean ?
[09:27:32] <silverdust> the increment and decrement control with mouse clicks do not update what's expected
[09:27:35] <silverdust> to update
[09:27:36] <silverdust> ok
[09:27:44] <rindolf> silverdust: ah, I see.
[09:27:57] <silverdust> so change event then?
[09:28:03] <robertmaxrees> try it.
[09:28:13] <robertmaxrees> .on('change', function() {});
[09:28:26] <robertmaxrees> you could also do .on('change, input', function() {});
[09:28:59] <silverdust> ok

[09:34:55] <jak2000> any advice?
[09:35:22] <rindolf> kryl: hi, sup?
[09:36:09] <kryl> wondering why jquery.getjson function doesn't apply immediately.
[09:36:19] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean, kryl?
[09:36:51] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 that's a huge fiddle. can you try to simplify it and your question?
[09:38:05] <jak2000> ok i try
[09:38:19] <robertmaxrees> you want to initialize a select dropdown on a particular value?
[09:38:20] <kryl> robertmaxrees, https://ptpb.pw/iTaf
[09:38:27] <jak2000> yes
[09:38:29] <kryl> maybe it will be more clear with an example
[09:38:33] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you follow me?
[09:38:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 huh?>
[09:38:49] <robertmaxrees> kryl it's async
[09:38:58] <jak2000> 1) wich value have the ID: 149 in column Productor?
[09:38:59] <robertmaxrees> the browser fires the request and keeps going.
[09:39:24] <robertmaxrees> kryl anything that relies on the getJSON call finishing should be in its .done()/success callback.
[09:39:27] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 not making sense again.
[09:39:42] <kryl> ok I did it differently with done and I get the same error message
[09:39:44] <jak2000> ok simplyfi the fiddle wait a moment please
[09:39:55] <robertmaxrees> kryl you need to put everything in the .done() callback.
[09:40:05] <robertmaxrees> all code.  you cannot rely on that variable being set otherwise
[09:42:38] <kryl> robertmaxrees, https://ptpb.pw/-eg1
[09:43:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[09:44:03] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/73bdf3d74a80
[09:44:12] <robertmaxrees> you cannot alert outside of the function.
[09:44:17] <robertmaxrees> the ajax hasn't finished yet.
[09:45:36] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/bLqgdu9g/6/
[09:45:54] <kryl> robertmaxrees, I was interrested to fill a variable and use it in an other part of my code. But I think I get it.
[09:45:58] <robertmaxrees> lol that doesn't help.  are you trying to set a particular option as selected on the dropdown, jak2000?
[09:46:08] <jak2000> when i click button editar
[09:46:09] <robertmaxrees> kryl yeah, you can't really do that.
[09:46:14] <Dr-007> what does jquery('#bla').once('.something') ... do for you?
[09:46:27] <robertmaxrees> Dr-007 creates an event binding that's removed after it runs ones.
[09:46:30] <robertmaxrees> *once
[09:46:35] <robertmaxrees> no idea what that selector is doing in there.
[09:46:44] <Dr-007> oh, my mistake
[09:46:48] <robertmaxrees> oh way, wrong method.
[09:46:49] <Dr-007> its without the dot
[09:47:01] <robertmaxrees> and it's .one()
[09:47:03] <robertmaxrees> not .once()
[09:47:19] <robertmaxrees> woah wait.
[09:47:19] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/RobLoach/jquery-once
[09:47:21] <Dr-007> $('div.contextual-links-wrapper', context).once('contextual-links', function () {
[09:47:22] <robertmaxrees> plugin maybe?
[09:47:28] <Dr-007> i think, drupal stuff
[09:47:35] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at what i linked.
[09:47:42] <Dr-007> thanks, im checking it now
[09:48:14] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 so you'd like to init a dropdown with a particular value selected?
[09:48:19] <jak2000> yes
[09:48:28] <jak2000> i try do this task on line of jquery:
[09:48:35] <robertmaxrees> use .val() to set the value to what of the option you want to select.
[09:48:42] <jak2000> line 88
[09:49:50] <jak2000> the columns start in 0 or in 1 ?
[09:49:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:50:27] <jak2000> var $xremext2 = $wRenglon.find("td:nth-child(4)");
[09:50:46] <jak2000> see the fiddle please: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/bLqgdu9g/8/
[09:50:54] <robertmaxrees> that's too much of a fiddle duder.
[09:51:03] <robertmaxrees> and it's 0 based.
[09:51:06] <jak2000> i explain...
[09:51:07] <jak2000> ok
[09:51:34] <notchris> I’m using a system that has a basic API, I’m trying to figure out, using these two functions, how to get user information
[09:51:35] <notchris> http://pastebin.com/pgESFS3u
[09:51:52] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 let me show you how you should make fiddles like this in the future.
[09:52:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9evdpdps/
[09:52:38] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[09:52:50] <robertmaxrees> instead of linking to 300 lines of js, isolate your particular problem
[09:53:14] <jak2000> ok
[09:53:16] <jak2000> checking
[09:53:18] <jak2000> thanks
[09:53:29] <robertmaxrees> notchris check the APIs docs.
[09:54:06] <notchris> robertmaxrees: I couldn’t find the correct information in them unfortunatley
[09:54:14] <robertmaxrees> notchris what do you mean?
[09:54:20] <robertmaxrees> if the docs are wrong, contact the vendor then.
[09:54:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you're doing something wrong :)
[09:54:35] <notchris> The vendor doesn’t care that the docs are poor sadly
[09:54:51] <robertmaxrees> something tells me that's not entirely true, but okay.  link to the docs?
[09:54:51] <notchris> I’ll do my best to figure it out
[09:57:34] <robertmaxrees> notchris link the docs :)
[09:58:07] <notchris> robertmaxrees: https://www.blackbaud.com/files/support/netcommunity-developer/Subsystems/custom-content-parts/custom-content-parts.htm
[09:58:35] <robertmaxrees> is this a public api for you to use?
[09:59:11] <robertmaxrees> because i'm not seeing anything in here about a userservice.
[09:59:47] <robertmaxrees> looks like maybe you're trying to access a "private" api here.
[09:59:49] <notchris> It’s really confusing what is available
[09:59:52] <notchris> Because there is also..
[10:00:13] <notchris> robertmaxrees: http://developer.blackbaud.com/bbis/reference/bbncextensions/N_BBNCExtensions.htm
[10:01:23] <robertmaxrees> where'd you find the reference to that userservice?
[10:01:25] <Kartagis> https://paste.debian.net/309832/ nodes is actually not empty here, http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7pvogueL/13/ gives different results than actual json. any ideas?
[10:01:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:02:00] <notchris> https://ctsciencecenter.thankyou4caring.org/webservices/webmethods.asmx
[10:02:02] <notchris> Maybe?
[10:02:55] <robertmaxrees> notchris that looks like autogenerated docs.
[10:03:46] <robertmaxrees> it feels like you're traipsing around in a private api and complaining that it's not documented for your use :)
[10:04:15] <notchris> Haha maybe
[10:04:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:04:20] <notchris> I’m just trying to pull some basic info
[10:04:27] <notchris> From our NC site
[10:04:43] <robertmaxrees> in a way not entirely supported by the vendor :)
[10:04:56] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: one sec. https://paste.debian.net/309834/ why the difference? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7pvogueL/13/ gives me the latter. however I get the former with the same user
[10:05:11] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis you mean you're loading that JSON with that ajax call?
[10:05:23] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: aye
[10:06:10] <robertmaxrees> what's up with the nested ajax call?
[10:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost about what your problem is.
[10:07:06] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe your server isn't responding correctly.
[10:07:12] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: instead of trying to find a way to pass a var to another page, I came up with this
[10:07:20] <NoiseEee> find a way?
[10:07:26] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:07:38] <Kartagis> nvm that
[10:07:47] <NoiseEee> someOtherPage.html?someVariable=someValue
[10:08:15] <Kartagis> NoiseEee: js too?
[10:08:39] <robertmaxrees> you want session management.
[10:09:32] <Kartagis> okay, I'll look into that later
[10:09:45] <Kartagis> back to my original issue
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees> the json coming back from the server is "wrong"?
[10:10:11] <Kartagis> what causes that? all my ajax calls work
[10:10:28] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: aye, nodes is not empty
[10:10:35] <robertmaxrees> it obviously is empty >.>
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you it that URL directly?
[10:11:07] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: in my paste.debian.net paste, former
[10:11:27] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that means your server is doing something you're not expecting.
[10:12:03] <steeze> say i have var foo = $('form'). how can i then select children of that like $(foo ' > input')?
[10:12:11] <robertmaxrees> .find() steeze
[10:12:18] <robertmaxrees> foo.find('input')
[10:12:24] <steeze> ah doi, thanks
[10:13:10] <Kartagis> doh!
[10:13:38] <Kartagis> I had changed the webservice path, but not on jsfiddle
[10:13:48] * Kartagis headpalms
[10:13:58] <xenaxon> HI! NEED some help with 3 imbricated **each loops
[10:14:07] <Kartagis> but, why didn't it give 404?
[10:14:20] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis that's a question for your server.
[10:14:27] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon lol, we call those "nested"
[10:14:34] <snover> imbricated. i like it.
[10:14:35] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing in a jsfiddle.
[10:14:36] <xenaxon> right!
[10:14:38] <xenaxon> :)))
[10:14:50] <xenaxon> we say imbricated loops, in mother Romania
[10:15:02] <xenaxon> or ifs
[10:15:27] <xenaxon> I have 3 jquery eaches, one {another{another{}}}
[10:15:30] <robertmaxrees> lol, generally in the english speaking dev community you hear people refer to them as "nested loops" :)
[10:15:32] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[10:15:37] <robertmaxrees> instead of describing it.
[10:16:23] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/vv6k6t09/
[10:16:27] <xenaxon> this is my code
[10:16:33] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:16:40] <robertmaxrees> why do you have timeouts?
[10:17:02] <xenaxon> I need to go through 3 select options
[10:17:18] <xenaxon> first is Car Model
[10:17:26] <xenaxon> sorry, first is Car Make
[10:17:27] <robertmaxrees> does this trigger ajax or something?
[10:17:36] <xenaxon> second is Year and third is Model
[10:17:42] <xenaxon> yes, it triggers ajax
[10:17:45] <xenaxon> and it takes around 2 seconds
[10:17:49] <robertmaxrees> then use the global ajax events.
[10:17:54] <robertmaxrees> instead of setTimeout :)
[10:18:06] <xenaxon> make abstraction of the inner details
[10:18:22] <xenaxon> I want to do it this way, and this way only
[10:18:26] <robertmaxrees> uh
[10:18:28] <xenaxon> I can query to see length
[10:18:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea, but okay.
[10:18:38] <robertmaxrees> so what's the end goal here?
[10:18:53] <xenaxon> it is to get the car/year/make in a json object
[10:18:56] <xenaxon> or echo to console
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> every single available one?
[10:19:25] <xenaxon> yes, and it takes around 2 seconds when a select change is made
[10:19:35] <robertmaxrees> contact the company then ;)
[10:19:37] <xenaxon> for the other 2 to get updated
[10:19:45] <robertmaxrees> instead of stealing their data.
[10:20:07] <xenaxon> it's not stealing, it's freely available data
[10:20:19] <robertmaxrees> then contact the vendor and ask them for a copy of it :)
[10:20:24] <xenaxon> I guess contacting would be a good idea
[10:21:50] <xenaxon> only problem is, it could take weeks for them to respond
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> don't steal their data, yo.
[10:22:32] <robertmaxrees> scraping is shady business.
[10:25:19] <robertmaxrees> that being said, i'd say you're going about this the wrong way.  check out using global ajax events and do each dropdown at a time, instead of these nested .each() statements.
[10:35:16] <jak2000> robertmaxrees done with your advice, thanks
[10:35:30] <robertmaxrees> understand the basic concept?
[10:35:34] <jak2000> have a solution: beforeunload  on mobile devices?
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:35:55] <jak2000> robertmaxrees yes
[10:36:05] <jak2000> i know that: beforeunload not work on  mobile devices...
[10:36:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with it?
[10:36:22] <jak2000> right?
[10:37:32] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6205989/is-there-an-alternative-method-to-use-onbeforeunload-in-mobile-safari
[10:37:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:37:51] <jak2000> display an alert message when data is not saved ..
[10:38:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that i've ever seen a mobile browser do that.
[10:39:03] <jak2000> ok, other thing robert, if the user capture an invoice (Master and Detail data) and the pc was turned off, exist an alternative saving data into temporary file? cookies? any urle for learn?
[10:39:39] <robertmaxrees> ajax data back to the server silently and "save" their status somehow.
[10:39:51] <robertmaxrees> you can't do anything about the computer turning on and off.
[10:40:02] <jak2000> by accidently, understand me?
[10:40:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can try to use localStorage, but browser support might be funky.
[10:40:32] <jak2000> and of course when the pc is turned on, say "want recover the previously data captured?"
[10:40:47] <jak2000> googling: jquery+localstorage
[10:40:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 there's no "jquery" for localstorage.
[10:41:03] <robertmaxrees> and what you want isn't appropriate for a website.
[10:41:16] <jak2000> then if user lose the data
[10:41:25] <jak2000> the best way is recapture again the data?
[10:41:30] <robertmaxrees> that's why you regularly save it to your server.
[10:41:39] <robertmaxrees> you can't protect end users from themselves.
[10:41:39] <jak2000> ok..
[10:43:35] <Kartagis> in http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7pvogueL/15/ does var duser get passed to the secone ajax call as data?
[10:44:31] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:44:34] <robertmaxrees> in the body of the post.
[11:07:11] <b-lew> I'm getting back a JSON object that is counting ex: 0,1,2,3 etc... How do I loop through each one? Do I need to set a counter?
[11:07:46] <b-lew> if i do something like JSONResults[0].patientName it brings back one result
[11:07:58] <Kartagis> $.each
[11:08:06] <b-lew> not sure how to bring back each
[11:08:17] <Kartagis> testcase?
[11:08:26] <b-lew> I was trying to use this.
[11:08:27] <b-lew> http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-loop-json-data/
[11:09:21] <Kartagis> have you got a testcase? make a fiddle
[11:10:55] <b-lew> okay
[11:11:03] <robertmaxrees> use forEach()
[11:11:19] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/jukffatb/
[11:12:03] <robertmaxrees> JSONresults.forEach(function(currentResult) { console.log(currentResult) });
[11:12:13] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the data?
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> or at least the format?
[11:12:56] <b-lew> yea let me update with an example of the data
[11:13:41] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want to .map() over stuff instead.
[11:14:21] <b-lew> that's what I was wondering,
[11:14:25] <b-lew> not sure how to do that tho
[11:15:00] <robertmaxrees> share the data.
[11:15:02] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[11:15:52] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees: is that like one of the highest questions asked here? JSON?
[11:16:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean
[11:16:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[11:16:12] <b-lew> thanks trying to figure out how to share the data
[11:16:16] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[11:16:39] <ceramicskull> Like each loops? My question was in regards to json and I've always see others asking for help with json
[11:17:19] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull i'm still lost haha.  i think it's more that people aren't familiar with how to build up basic data structures.
[11:17:31] <robertmaxrees> or aren't familiar with how to do basic enumeration/iteration.
[11:17:42] <robertmaxrees> but it's not as common as you'd think - that's js 101 stuff.
[11:18:01] <b-lew> well I can't just paste in info
[11:18:19] <robertmaxrees> b-lew them make an example "entry" or something.
[11:18:28] <robertmaxrees> ceramicskull i'd say we get a lot more questions about events/delegation/etc than anything else.
[11:20:08] <b-lew> like this? http://jsfiddle.net/jukffatb/3/
[11:20:18] <robertmaxrees> wat
[11:20:33] <robertmaxrees> that... is not valid data.
[11:20:55] <robertmaxrees> copy the actual data and replace any sensitive info, if that's the problem.
[11:21:26] <robertmaxrees> var JSONResuls = LensOrders = [];
[11:27:29] <b-lew> better? http://jsfiddle.net/jukffatb/5/
[11:27:57] <robertmaxrees> is that really how your data is structured? O.o
[11:28:06] <b-lew> yea, that's why I'm having issues.
[11:28:17] <b-lew> the 0,1,2 is throwing me off
[11:28:22] <robertmaxrees> that's really bad.
[11:28:29] <robertmaxrees> can you fix this at all?
[11:28:41] <b-lew> might take awhile
[11:28:47] <b-lew> they should take out the 0,1,2, huh?
[11:28:52] <b-lew> or I should make a count
[11:28:58] <b-lew> not sure how to do that either tho
[11:29:11] <b-lew> I can ask them
[11:29:28] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jukffatb/6/
[11:29:32] <robertmaxrees> it should like like this.
[11:29:36] <robertmaxrees> *look like
[11:30:07] <Utils> Untested as it's example code but if I'm creating events like in the code where the object created is discarded (maybe via a room closure in a chat) and more rooms are added, would that be an issue? http://pastebin.com/mNJKi5rS
[11:30:08] <km4> hi
[11:30:12] <b-lew> I'll try to ask them
[11:30:15] <b-lew> that would make it easy
[11:30:37] <xenaxon> how to make line execute after an EACH has finished
[11:30:38] <xenaxon> ?
[11:30:42] <robertmaxrees> b-lew otherwise you're doing JSONResults[0][0]
[11:31:01] <robertmaxrees> err, JSONResults[0]['0'].  you can map over that but that's really awk.
[11:31:02] <b-lew> what does that do?
[11:31:08] <b-lew> [0][0]
[11:31:17] <robertmaxrees> get index 0 of the object at index 0.
[11:31:35] <robertmaxrees> JSONResults[0] gets an object, then you'd access propery '0'
[11:31:38] <robertmaxrees> fix the structure first.
[11:31:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to fight against yourself.
[11:35:03] <robertmaxrees> Utils decouple the event bindings from that functon.
[11:35:11] <robertmaxrees> one delegated listener should handle everything.
[11:39:22] <Utils> robertmaxrees: what do you mean by "decouple"?
[11:41:36] <robertmaxrees> don't put event bindings within other functions.
[11:42:21] <robertmaxrees> and also, $(document).on('something', this.element.find('something'), onSomething); doesn't do what you think it does - you can't use a jquery object as the second arg, only a selector.
[11:47:53] <Utils> robertmaxrees: hmm. yeah i just didn't realy to clutter non-Room logic anywhere else but i guess i don't have much of a choice.
[11:48:07] <Utils> i mean room logic...
[11:48:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not clutter.
[11:48:32] <robertmaxrees> are you using a framework of some kind?
[11:48:51] <robertmaxrees> because they often have you do it that way - backbone views for instance.
[11:56:57] <Utils> No. I looked into backbone but it came across as a little complex to even use. I don't particularly need routes either as that comes bundled with backbone, the views are controlled by responses from the socket connection.
[11:57:15] <robertmaxrees> you could just use backbone views and get all your benefits from that.
[12:04:00] <ravigehlot> What is wrong with this syntax: $('select.lifestyle option[value=]').attr('selected','');
[12:04:13] <robertmaxrees> .prop('selected', false);
[12:04:33] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: and why not attr in this case?
[12:04:46] <robertmaxrees> generally you want to access the object properties, not the markup.
[12:05:00] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: that's truw
[12:05:03] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[12:06:44] <molkemon> halp, i know this is not exactly the right place, but could someone with win10/edge browser take a look at this page: http://popupstory.eu/index_en.php and tell me if on page transitions (especially when opening "list your brand" and "location" (buttom menu) you get like crazy ass flickering
[12:07:11] <molkemon> it might be just on my end because my gpu on this machine is a bit wonky
[12:07:12] <robertmaxrees> molkemon you can get a VM with edge on it for free.
[12:07:33] <molkemon> i have win 10 myself, i just need to know if others can reproduce the problem
[12:07:33] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's what you're doing - ignore me!
[12:07:45] <ravigehlot> robertmaxrees: that didn't fix it though
[12:07:50] <molkemon> everything works fine in chrome/firefox, and also in IE on win 7 machine
[12:07:54] <robertmaxrees> ravigehlot make a fiddle then.,
[12:08:07] <molkemon> but on edge/ie, the site flickers insanely hard and i don't see why
[12:08:13] <molkemon> but it might be the gpu in this machine
[12:09:23] <claytonzaugg> anyone familiar with clipping or masking a div?  I have js calling css and doing a lot, but I'd like to hide the menus coming in from the side.
[12:09:50] <claytonzaugg> I've tried clip-path: and mask: in CSS, but to no avail.  Anything in the jquery worl that can help?
[12:09:53] <Utils> Not understanding backbone views at all either. you can define model, collection, el, id, className, tagName, attributes and events to a view... I don't understand what they are used for
[12:10:14] <robertmaxrees> Utils you can ignore a lot of that.  let me show you the basic idea.
[12:10:19] <Utils> ok thanks
[12:16:12] <quang> hi
[12:16:29] <quang> if i have a javascript object how can i make it so i can add attributes using jquery?
[12:16:33] <quang> like
[12:16:39] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery for that.
[12:16:41] <quang> $(circle)
[12:16:45] <quang> can u do that?
[12:16:54] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery to do that.
[12:16:59] <quang> cuz i want to add data atrribute to it
[12:17:07] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are for DOM nodes.
[12:17:13] <robertmaxrees> not for normal objects.
[12:17:16] <quang> well im trying to add data attributes to easeljs circle
[12:17:23] <robertmaxrees> select it and use .data() then.
[12:17:25] <quang> to use materialcss tooltips
[12:17:35] <quang> circle.data()
[12:17:37] <quang> ?
[12:17:38] <quang> like that?
[12:17:44] <robertmaxrees> $('yourCircleSelector').data()
[12:17:46] <robertmaxrees> need to select it first.
[12:17:47] <quang> but i need data-tooltip
[12:17:57] <quang> but i have it as an object in js
[12:18:05] <quang> an easel circle
[12:18:06] <robertmaxrees> is the object the DOM node?
[12:18:11] <quang> that hasnt been added yet
[12:18:32] <quang> var circle = new createjs.Shape();  circle.graphics.beginFill("Violet").drawCircle(0, 0, radius);
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.alpha = 0.2;
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.x = spot.x;
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.y = spot.y;
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.scaleX = spot.scale;
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.scaleY = spot.scale;
[12:18:33] <quang>         circle.className = 'btn tooltipped';
[12:18:35] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:18:39] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste in the channel.
[12:18:40] <quang> like see
[12:18:44] <robertmaxrees> and that's not going to work the way you want it to.
[12:18:46] <quang> i want to use circle
[12:18:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to do it after it's been appended.
[12:18:53] <robertmaxrees> you cannot do what you want otherwise.
[12:18:53] <quang> dang
[12:18:55] <quang> really?
[12:19:01] <quang> man
[12:19:05] <quang> that sux
[12:19:13] <quang> ok
[12:19:20] <quang> well i can add it in the mouseover event?
[12:19:21] <quang> idk
[12:19:23] <robertmaxrees> Utils http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ymuvyy5s/1/
[12:19:25] <quang> i just want to add the tooltip
[12:19:32] <robertmaxrees> quang you could do it after you initialize it.
[12:19:35] <robertmaxrees> just select it.
[12:19:58] <quang> hmm
[12:20:01] <quang> ok i will try
[12:20:06] <quang> thanks for the idea
[12:21:42] <robertmaxrees> Utils the initialize function is run as soon as the view is instantiated, the events property is what handles your bindings, and you can define all the functions you want.
[12:22:05] <robertmaxrees> the el: document.querySelector('.myWidget') is how you pass in the element to bind to.
[12:23:08] <robertmaxrees> rather, the element you're operating against.  you can do this, too: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ymuvyy5s/2/
[12:28:05] <Utils> robertmaxrees: where do templates come into play? i mean the dom for the view already exists even without the view being initialised.
[12:28:31] <Utils> and how woudl I handle like widgets... say if I click on a username, and a menu popped up with some actions etc
[12:28:34] <robertmaxrees> Utils you can supply templates if you'd like or don'e.
[12:28:43] <robertmaxrees> *don't.
[12:28:55] <robertmaxrees> like in that fiddle - see how the markup is all already there?
[12:29:27] <robertmaxrees> as far as initializing widgets/plugins - that depends.  does that need to happen when the view initializes?  or just on pageload?
[12:29:59] <Utils> robertmaxrees: view initializes, but nothing happens or displays until a username is clicked on.
[12:30:08] <robertmaxrees> sure, like the fiddle.
[12:30:13] <robertmaxrees> click on a link ;)
[12:30:45] <Utils> but that doesnt' create a view within that view so i dont see how that helps
[12:30:53] <robertmaxrees> you don't need a view in that view.
[12:31:26] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ymuvyy5s/3/
[12:31:39] <robertmaxrees> the initialize function can handle whatever you want it to.
[12:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you could also do subviews if you really wanted, but that doesn't really make sense.  just use your parent "widget" and call it a day.
[12:33:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ymuvyy5s/4/ little more fleshed out.
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> really simple stuff.
[12:36:24] <Utils> lol backbone doesn't even have it's own templating system :(
[12:36:29] <Utils> never used underscore either.
[12:36:38] <Utils> never understood what it was for
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> underscore's templating system is stupid simple.
[12:36:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all about giving you structure and convenience.
[12:40:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ymuvyy5s/5/
[12:40:55] <robertmaxrees> expanding some more.
[12:44:04] <nerdfiles> Hi all.
[12:44:05] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/ well I'm struggling.
[12:44:28] <nerdfiles> Anyone know how to simulate a Keypress for Enter automatically when the page loads with Google Maps Places?
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> Utils open your console :)
[12:45:03] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/1/ well I'm still struggling.
[12:45:05] <Utils> nothingin console this time
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> also: you're not using the right delimiters for the the template.
[12:45:19] <nerdfiles> I've tried almost everything: dispatchEvent, a full open source KeyEventm HTMLEvents, etc.
[12:45:20] <robertmaxrees> <%= %>
[12:45:25] <Utils> i thought i can use mustache-style ones?
[12:45:34] <robertmaxrees> if you change the delimiter settings
[12:45:42] <robertmaxrees> nerdfiles why?
[12:45:57] <nerdfiles> I'm loading nearest convenience stores on Google Maps.
[12:46:14] <nerdfiles> And I want to load these on the map as markers without the user having to explicitly hit Enter.
[12:46:45] <nerdfiles> The app does a granular reverse lookup of Products from Amazon's Product API.
[12:46:55] <taplar> if you extracted the function as a named function, you could call that instead of having to trigger an event
[12:46:56] <Utils> robertmaxrees: what's the difference between <% <%= and <%-
[12:46:58] <nerdfiles> And tries to guess deals relevant to your purchase history.
[12:47:11] <robertmaxrees> Utils also, you had a bad selector - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/557k0rsy/2/
[12:47:22] <nerdfiles> Well, even places_changed doesn't fire.
[12:47:35] <robertmaxrees> Utils the delimiter is <%= %>, not <%- %>
[12:47:35] <nerdfiles> It has to be the Enter key event on an input field, it seems.
[12:49:07] <robertmaxrees> nerdfiles they should have an api that doesn't require you to do that.  otherwise, http://stackoverflow.com/a/832121/923919
[12:49:20] <Utils> robertmaxrees: http://underscorejs.org/#template i see 3 used there.
[12:49:47] <robertmaxrees> and all three have explanations.
[12:50:06] <robertmaxrees> you want <%= … %> - this allows you to inject a thing.
[12:50:16] <robertmaxrees> <% … %>. is to run js inline (avoid it at all costs)
[12:50:31] <robertmaxrees> <%- … %> is for escaping data.
[12:51:12] <robertmaxrees> your example, updated, should actually be http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/557k0rsy/3/
[12:51:25] <acidjazz> what is that
[12:51:26] <acidjazz> asp
[12:51:34] <robertmaxrees> underscore templates
[12:51:43] <acidjazz> oh cool
[12:51:58] <acidjazz> that your preference?
[12:52:04] <acidjazz> i mainly use jade
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> i prefer jsx
[12:52:20] <robertmaxrees> underscore's nice if you need something simple and fast.
[12:52:41] <Utils> i dont see what you changed apart from line 22 to 24.
[12:52:47] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[12:52:53] <robertmaxrees> you wanted this.template(o) - only one arg.
[12:52:54] <robertmaxrees> not two.
[12:53:17] <Utils> wheres view.msg ?
[12:53:21] <Utils> that's what i wanted.
[12:53:31] <Utils> ithought the views template was done automatically.
[12:53:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused by what you're trying to do now.
[12:53:49] <Utils> it's a chat application. chat messages get appended to .chat-messages
[12:53:50] <Utils> it's that simple.
[12:53:56] <Utils> view.msg is a chat message
[12:53:59] <Utils> view.chat is the main view
[12:54:05] <Utils> view.msg gets appended to view.chat (.chat-messages)
[12:54:13] <robertmaxrees> then you need to explicitly append it.
[12:54:24] <Utils> why do you think i did $(".chat-messages").append(...) ?
[12:54:48] <robertmaxrees> this.template(view.msg, o) is wrong.
[12:54:50] <robertmaxrees> that's my point.
[12:55:01] <Utils> it was _.template
[12:55:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:55:07] <Utils> what
[12:55:33] <robertmaxrees> you're really confused :) this.template references your view.chat() template.
[12:55:57] <robertmaxrees> this.template() doesn't take any parameters - passing anything to it doesn't make sense.
[12:56:01] <Utils> i didn't use this.template!
[12:56:04] <Utils> i used _.template!
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/1/
[12:56:22] <robertmaxrees> that's what you had duder.
[12:56:36] <Utils> line 23: _.template
[12:56:48] <robertmaxrees> right, not what you want to do.
[12:56:56] <wcfields> its on the tip of my tongue, but is there a javascript / jquery framework to create a tutorial / how to?
[12:57:03] <Utils> is it not? I wanted to append view.msg to .chat-messages
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> Utils that's not how you do that, that's what i'm trying to tell you.
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting it ;)
[12:58:06] <Utils> foo = _.template(view.msg); foo(o) ?
[12:58:25] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/6/
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:59:23] <robertmaxrees> you're really convoluting this.,
[13:00:02] <Utils> if it was mustache it'd be easy: Mustache.render(view.chat, o)
[13:00:19] <Utils> at least that's what works for me.
[13:00:20] <robertmaxrees> then use moustache...
[13:00:28] <Utils> idk how.
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:00:38] <robertmaxrees> you just said it's really easy.
[13:00:50] <Utils> it is. but i dont know how ot use it with backbone/underscore
[13:00:55] <Utils> whats line 8 for?
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm fixing your example.
[13:01:38] <gambl0re> sup playboy...
[13:02:02] <robertmaxrees> Utils http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/557k0rsy/7/
[13:07:42] <nerdfiles> robertmaxrees, thank you.
[13:07:50] <nerdfiles> I was using the wrong API.
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> :) sounded like it.
[13:08:32] <Utils> why did yo uchange <%- to <%=, it's a bad idea to have usernames unescaped?
[13:08:57] <robertmaxrees> because you're doing simple string substitution.
[13:09:08] <robertmaxrees> it's just an example.
[13:09:15] <robertmaxrees> feel free to expand upon it as needed.
[13:14:45] <Utils> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/8/ cannot read property 'replace' of undefined
[13:14:48] <Utils> trying to do a menu
[13:18:26] <Utils> oh
[13:18:29] <Utils> i see what i did
[13:20:01] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/9/ there's no username in the menu, and the body click doesn't seem to close the menu
[13:20:13] <Utils> talk about complexity.
[13:25:06] <Utils> click body doesn't even work... awkward.
[13:26:10] <Utils> eh apparently i ca't as it's bound to $el
[13:26:14] <Utils> so have ot do it in the initialize.
[13:26:16] <Utils> stupid.
[13:28:32] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/11/ finally got a menu.. but still no username in the menu!!!
[13:29:05] <Utils> apparently undefined...
[13:29:07] <Utils> <a href="#" class="username" data-id="<%= id %>" data-nick="<%= username %>">
[13:29:08] <Utils> its right there.
[13:29:09] <Utils> oh
[13:29:10] <Utils> nick
[13:29:28] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/12/ so is this how i'd do user menus
[13:50:03] <ajf-> In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings 'show', 'hide', and 'toggle'. These shortcuts allow for custom hiding and showing animations that take into account the display type of the element. In order to use jQuery's built-in toggle state tracking, the 'toggle' keyword must be consistently given as the value of the property being animated.
[13:50:07] <ajf-> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[13:50:51] <ajf-> how do I use that to make an object animate from-to (maxHeight: 1px), and (maxHeight: 1000) and toggle each tiem ?
[13:50:52] <ajf-> *time
[13:51:16] <ajf-> I put it as part of the value as a string like it says? maxHeight: 'toggle:1'  ?
[13:53:23] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: why would you recommend jsx for templating
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> because I like react :)
[13:54:01] <acidjazz> but jsx isnt really a templating engine
[13:54:06] <ajf-> I like it the other way around: everything in the html file
[13:54:08] <ajf-> =)
[13:54:12] <acidjazz> what are you using react with?
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:54:16] <ajf-> <script></script> : ) keeps things simple
[13:54:21] <robertmaxrees> ew
[13:54:34] <ajf-> styles too
[13:54:36] <robertmaxrees> and acidjazz let me clarify some more - i prefer the concept behind react.  i have limited experience with it.
[13:54:43] <ajf-> simplicity is beauty
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> what little bit I have worked with i've really liked.
[13:54:58] <robertmaxrees> ajf- for most project i work on, those simply arent sufficient.
[13:55:01] <robertmaxrees> *projects
[13:55:06] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: cool
[13:55:21] <ajf-> what if you could simplify the project's complexity so much
[13:55:26] <ajf-> that they could
[13:55:33] <robertmaxrees> but you can't.
[13:55:35] <robertmaxrees> that's the problem.
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> multiple modules of JS files that need to get included at different times.
[13:55:50] <robertmaxrees> based on the page, etc.
[13:55:57] <ajf-> well yeah
[13:56:20] <ajf-> maybe you can use some libraries but i like it when the final logic is so simple you can just put it in the html
[13:56:27] <robertmaxrees> hence my statement including "most of the projects i work on"
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> and no, stick your JS in JS files.
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're giving yourself a whole bunch of different places to look for code, instead of a few.
[13:57:26] <ajf-> I enjoy the ocasional jquery so kill me
[13:57:32] <ajf->  =)
[13:58:10] <snover> acknowledged, killbots converging on your location now.
[13:58:53] <ajf-> i live in a dome made of a copper grid
[14:13:59] <ajf-> any info on the animate() matter ?
[14:33:56] <Utils> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/557k0rsy/12/ is this how you'd do a pop-up user menu?
[14:36:49] <robertmaxrees> Utils not $(document).on('click', this._closeMenu);
[14:36:57] <robertmaxrees> use the events property.
[14:37:13] <robertmaxrees> oooh i get why you did that.
[14:37:15] <robertmaxrees> funky.
[14:37:17] <acidjazz> SIMPLIFY THE COMPLEXITY
[14:37:36] <Utils> yea i googled, click events are bound to the views $el
[14:37:43] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:37:46] <Utils> and when i need something for the whole page... then ya
[15:19:23] <Utils> robertmaxrees: are tabs, views?
[15:19:53] <Utils> say if I had a tabcontrol inside a view... and the tabcontrols had a room object like i shown before alllll the way up there ^
[15:20:07] <Utils> where would that fit in
[15:20:48] <robertmaxrees> you could do subviews if you wanted, or split things up a little more.
[15:20:55] <robertmaxrees> kind of up to however you want to doi it.
[15:20:57] <robertmaxrees> *do
[15:29:28] <Utils> im probably best without backbone.
[15:29:36] <Utils> but ill look more at underscore templating.
[15:29:40] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[15:40:39] <vacho> how do I listen to the show event? http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/ContributorsGuide/
[16:28:38] <Skizu> I'm using an insertBefore() and I have an event $().on('click') that's not firing on the inserted object, how do I fix that?
[16:28:46] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[16:29:01] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('click', 'insertedElement', function() {});
[16:29:29] <Skizu> Wait what
[16:29:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:29:57] <robertmaxrees> what's the parent element all of this lives in?
[16:30:16] <Skizu> I'm doing this... $('cotainer').on('click', '.tag', function() {});
[16:30:26] <robertmaxrees> does the container exist on pageload?
[16:30:32] <Skizu> Ohhh it needs to be on the parent container
[16:30:34] <Skizu> Yeah
[16:30:39] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[16:30:55] <sillyslux> and there's maybe a typo
[16:31:02] <sillyslux> cotainer container
[16:31:14] <robertmaxrees> that's probably not the actual selector.
[16:31:33] <Skizu> Can I do something like... $(parent).on('click', '.box .tag', function() {})
[16:31:42] <robertmaxrees> is .tag a child of .box?
[16:31:47] <Skizu> Yeah
[16:31:49] <robertmaxrees> then sure.
[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> (i can't divine your markup so i'm guessing here)
[16:32:02] <Skizu> Sweet because the object I actually care about is the box
[16:32:10] <robertmaxrees> then just do the box.
[16:33:46] <Skizu> robertmaxrees: <3 you beauty it worked
[16:33:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:34:07] <Skizu> I was doing it on the box (boxes get added)
[16:49:53] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/m12Lju3t/ ; could someone guide, i want to check on the T radio. thanks
[16:50:15] <robertmaxrees> why do you have a timeout?
[16:50:45] <robertmaxrees> also, that table isn't valid.  fix that.
[16:51:07] <smgs> , 100) ? timeout ?
[16:51:14] <robertmaxrees> setTimeout(function()
[16:51:22] <robertmaxrees> what's that for?
[16:51:40] <smgs> oh yes, it helps to atleast start the script after a .1 second.
[16:51:49] <robertmaxrees> why are you waiting .1 second?
[16:52:28] <smgs> ...to be on safe side ? do you suggest i can keep it at 1 also instead of 100?
[16:52:37] <robertmaxrees> you don't need a timeout at all.
[16:52:39] <smgs> or completely skip it ?
[16:52:50] <robertmaxrees> completely remove it.
[16:52:57] <smgs> OH! that would be awesome if it works that way. okies. removing.
[16:53:05] <robertmaxrees> that's how it works.
[16:53:18] <smgs> removed.
[16:53:30] <smgs> will remove from all my other scripts thanks. :)
[16:53:31] <robertmaxrees> so fix the markup, open your console, and go from there.
[16:53:33] <robertmaxrees> simple errors
[16:53:41] <smgs> markup is ?
[16:53:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html.
[16:53:47] <robertmaxrees> you'
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> *you're missing a wrapping table and a tr
[16:54:22] <smgs> robertmaxrees, the html i copy pasted from other website's source.
[16:54:32] <smgs> so i cannot fix it. it is like that only
[16:54:35] <robertmaxrees> the fiddle should still have a valid markup fragment.
[16:54:53] <smgs> ok. let me google and set it correct
[16:54:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m12Lju3t/1/
[16:54:58] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[16:55:00] <robertmaxrees> not hard.
[16:55:05] <smgs> thanks. checking
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> so open your console and fix all the errors you see.
[16:55:31] <smgs> on jsfiddle how to open console i dont know.
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> your browser's console.
[16:55:45] <robertmaxrees> the developer tools
[16:55:56] <smgs> on jsfiddle site itself can i do it ?
[16:56:02] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:56:08] <robertmaxrees> you need to use your browser's tools.
[16:56:11] <smgs> ok. wait.
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle doesn't have them.
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> if you're on windows, f12 in the browser, then make sure you've clicked the "Console" tab.
[16:57:50] <smgs> i am chrome. i am console.
[16:58:07] <robertmaxrees> see the errors
[16:58:24] <smgs> Uncaught ReferenceError: CheckRadio is not defined
[16:58:32] <robertmaxrees> see the problem there?
[16:58:35] <smgs> i guess this is the one relevant..
[16:59:09] <robertmaxrees> you do function checkRadio() {} but then try to call it as CheckRadio()
[16:59:13] <robertmaxrees> see why that's a problem?
[16:59:40] <smgs> checkradio() is a function... and it is called like that only..
[16:59:58] <robertmaxrees> you're calling CheckRadio() - the c is capitalized.
[16:59:59] <smgs> checkradio() {} vs checkradio() ?
[17:00:10] <smgs> oh. rectifying C
[17:01:21] <smgs> robertmaxrees! what is was just the small c issue ? cannot believe. rechecking
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> your code's really poorly formatted fwiw.
[17:02:04] <smgs> :(. wait. formatting it now.
[17:02:05] <robertmaxrees> and keep looking at that console.
[17:02:06] <robertmaxrees> more errors.
[17:03:06] <smgs> console. <- no more errors. :_
[17:03:09] <smgs> :)*
[17:03:14] <robertmaxrees> there's most certainly another one.
[17:03:20] <robertmaxrees> something about r not being defined.
[17:04:16] <smgs> RECECHED. no console errors!
[17:04:28] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting them in the fiddle, but okay.
[17:05:43] <smgs> https://bpaste.net/show/3eb81786027f formatted now ?
[17:06:40] <robertmaxrees> you could shorten that first line to just $(window).bind("load", checkRadio);
[17:07:30] <smgs> just that ?. trying
[17:12:50] <smgs> robertmaxrees, thanks. set it right. syntax error. missing ")" :)
[17:13:15] <smgs> oh wait.. checkradio) and not checkradio() ?
[17:13:20] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:13:32] <robertmaxrees> $(window).bind("load", checkRadio);
[17:14:16] <smgs> hell yeah! :)
[17:16:06] <smgs> robertmaxrees, there is another thing puzzling me a hell lot, that which i cannot exactly simulate in here, since it is at work PC. i want to get rid of activeX control on windows 8, IE 11, the activeX prompt to "Do you want to save..........." appears on the child window. is it possible to get rid of it? THANKS
[17:16:42] <robertmaxrees> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/genuine/ie-activex
[17:17:08] <robertmaxrees> change from "Enable" to "Prompt" on these and you're g2g
[17:17:42] <smgs> robertmaxrees, so that would help me disable those prompts. i just that them. they waste like 1 minute
[17:17:53] <smgs> i just hate them*
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> i would leave them on personally.
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> if this is at work, i'd check with your IT staff first.
[17:18:27] <smgs> yes IT staff is completely ignorant. they dont know much. :(
[17:18:33] <robertmaxrees> check with them.
[17:18:41] <robertmaxrees> they may have those prompts turned on purposefully
[17:18:44] <smgs> they say it is windows issue.
[17:19:19] <smgs> anyways i have bookmarked. will tell if it works or not in 24 hours or so. thanks.
[17:19:27] <robertmaxrees> please check with your IT staff first.
[17:19:54] <smgs> robertmaxrees, sure. :) will officially write to them.
[17:21:24] <smgs> sometimes even i fill the right captcha the other site says wrong captcha. it often happens when i am able to manually type the captcha fast. why does it happen ? is there a minumum time in which a user should not enter a captcha ?
[17:21:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> no idea.
[17:22:11] <smgs> damm this time i typed first but it accepted. retrying.
[17:23:07] <smgs> "cannot set property value of null" got this error. when i type the captcha fast.
[17:23:15] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[17:23:24] <smgs> okies. thanks. :)
[17:59:21] <Utils> out of curiosity, using backbonejs, how would you have two listeners for the same event?so say: 'click .something' and you wanted two listeners for that
[18:02:45] <Bloomberg> http://i.imgur.com/DE5BKlr.jpg
[18:02:56] <Bloomberg> How can I to access to 0 idex?
[18:02:59] <Bloomberg> index*
[18:12:04] <smgs> https://jsfiddle.net/d8ng9qkf/ ; is it possible to click on CANCEL. thanks
[18:12:48] <Woet> yes i just clicked it
[18:14:15] <smgs> Woet it works already ?
[18:14:23] <Woet> well i'm able to click it
[18:14:26] <Woet> so if thats your goal, sure
[18:14:34] <smgs> no. i want to automatically click it.
[18:14:50] <Woet> i guess you should start with a working demo then
[18:24:35] <smgs> Woet, http://jsfiddle.net/JVHEs/35/ almost there. could you guide ?
[18:26:18] <andrew_> How I would do this: http://jsfiddle.net/30gs6kLe/2/  basically I'm trying to read the right select based on the value from the button
[18:34:38] <Woet> smgs: works fine here
[18:34:52] <smgs> automatically does not get clicked. Woet.
[18:35:15] <Woet> smgs: $('#myHrefLink').click();
[18:35:25] <smgs> trying Woet
[18:37:02] <smgs> Woet, http://jsfiddle.net/JVHEs/37/ i dont see it blinking.. :(
[18:49:15] <smgs> http://jsfiddle.net/JVHEs/38/ ; Woet ?
[18:49:57] <Woet> smgs: what is supposed to be blinking..?
[18:50:01] <Woet> and no, i said $('#myHrefLink').click();
[18:50:06] <Woet> not .onclick
[18:50:19] <smgs> ok. trying
[18:50:44] <andrew_> Got it :-)
[18:57:48] <smgs> Woet http://jsfiddle.net/JVHEs/41/ :(
[19:00:55] <Woet> smgs: it won't execute javascript like that.
[19:01:01] <Woet> smgs: can you please just say what you're trying to achieve
[19:01:08] <Woet> instead of making 41 different versions of code that do different things on jsfiddle
[19:03:22] <smgs> Woet, just click on the "My HREF Link"
[19:03:43] <Woet> smgs: and?
[19:03:54] <smgs> Woet, just that. and nothing else
[19:05:07] <Woet> smgs: and what does the /actual/ link do?
[19:05:17] <smgs> opens another page...
[19:05:26] <Woet> smgs: why not take the href and use window.location?
[19:05:47] <smgs> hmm... Woet. okies. will look into that.
[20:09:33] <smgs> http://jsfiddle.net/JVHEs/45/ ; still stuck :(
[23:29:41] <norc_> Hi. Which is better practice for accessing this inside callbacks? Function.prototype.bind or reassigning this to self outside the callback? Here is an example of the way I use this: http://jsfiddle.net/gLyhfofa/
[23:31:43] <norc_> The issue I have with binding this to the function is readability.
[23:33:16] <Cork> norc_: if you replace this in the event handler you won't have another way to access it
[23:33:35] <Cork> so ya, pass it in as a different variable
[23:34:58] <norc_> Cork: Alright. I suppose for some callbacks that actually make use of `this´ (e.g. $.each) this might be the better way.
[23:35:24] <Cork> norc_: well as soon as you want to access the element the event was bound on you need this
[23:35:31] <Cork> and that should normally be fairly common
[23:36:12] <Cork> $(this).addClass('something') for example
[23:37:41] <norc_> Cork: I think we had this discussion last week, where I held the opinion its cleaner to use the named parameter.
[23:38:08] <Cork> norc_: sure, i know; the problem is you can't get "this" as a named parameter to an event
[23:38:21] <Cork> so if you override this you have no way to access it
[23:38:50] <norc_> `this´ feels more like $_ every day. :/
[23:39:04] <Cork> it isn't
[23:39:45] <norc_> Ah well, for conventions sake it makes more sense to do as you said. That way if I ever needed the original this in the callback, I can still access it.
[23:40:01] <norc_> (Instead of breaking convention and mixing both styles)
[23:40:08] <Cork> and like i said, that should be fairly common
[23:40:37] <norc_> Yeah so far Ive been doing the 'var self = this;' thing a lot.
[23:41:08] <Kartagis> why does http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7pvogueL/15/ return empty nodes even though it is not?
[23:41:42] <Cork> Kartagis: use a hash for data instead of building the string yourself, makes it more readable and safer
[23:41:53] <Cork> data: 'username=' + encodeURIComponent(name) + '&password=' + encodeURIComponent(pass) <-- i mean this part
[23:42:25] <Kartagis> how do I do that?
[23:42:49] <Cork>  data: { username: name, password: pass },
[23:43:05] <Cork> opps i said hash but meant an object...
[23:44:49] <beasty> morning Cork ! o/
[23:44:52] <Cork> Kartagis: what does console.log(JSON.stringify(gelen)) give you?
[23:44:54] <Cork> 0/
[23:45:36] <Kartagis> Cork: at the moment {"nodes":[],"view":{"name":"kullanici_oyunculari","display":"page_1","path":"kullanici-oyunculari.json","root":"nodes","child":"node","pages":0,"page":-1,"count":0,"limit":null}}
[23:45:59] <Cork> so what you get IS empty...
[23:46:04] <Cork> "nodes":[] <--
[23:46:11] <Kartagis> but it should really be {"nodes":[{"node":{"name":"tolga","title":"Tolga \u00d6zses","field_oyuncu_fotografi":{"src":"http://www.rejicast.com/sites/default/files/photo_0.jpg","alt":""}}}]
[23:46:25] <Cork> well that isn't something you can fix client side...
[23:48:27] <Kartagis> Cork: when you go to http://www.rejicast.com/user?destination=oyuncularim.json, that's what you get
[23:48:42] <Kartagis> please log in with tolga and 111222
[23:49:08] <Uhkis> Kartagis: remember to change that afterwards, it's soon publicly on the internet
[23:49:19] <Cork> heh ya
[23:49:24] <Kartagis> Uhkis: sure
[23:49:48] <Cork> Kartagis: and you're sure those two uses the same api?
[23:49:58] <Kartagis> Uhkis: my real password is not 111222, it is *******
[23:50:02] <Kartagis> :P
[23:50:09] <Uhkis> hunter2?
[23:50:11] <Kartagis> Cork: absolutely
[23:50:18] <Kartagis> no, hunter1
[23:50:26] * Cork wonders if anyone actually uses ********* for password :>
[23:50:42] <Kartagis> is it acceptable anyway?
[23:51:13] <Kartagis> I'm sure many websites will reject that because not different characters
[23:51:27] <Uhkis> i tried          for reddit, worked fine
[23:51:29] <Cork> didn't say it was for that site :)
[23:51:53] <Uhkis> too bad i couldn't login without a linux computer :D
[23:52:15] <Cork> why would you need a linux computer for that?
[23:53:14] <Uhkis> because i have no idea how to type nbsp on windows computer
[23:54:53] <Kartagis> you press n, then b, then s and finally p
[23:54:55] <Kartagis> heh
[23:55:12] <Kartagis> anyway, Cork have you got an idea?
[23:55:13] <Uhkis> Kartagis: non-breaking space! (alt gr + space on linux)
[23:56:00] <Cork> Uhkis: alt+ 255 on the numpad
