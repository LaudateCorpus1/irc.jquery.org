[00:02:43] <sathish> Hi this is a question on Jquery validate, Can anyone please let me know, how I can access the error text inside the highlight and unhighlight sections
[00:03:21] <sathish> I think I will need the error text only in the highlight section
[00:07:18] <DakotaBaer> this room is magic. came in here looking for help, and as soon as i joined the solution came to me
[00:09:46] <sathish>  Hi this is a question on Jquery validate, Can anyone please let me know, how I can access the error text inside the highlight and unhighlight sections
[00:13:56] <sammych> who wants to tell me the easy way to have rotated text fill it's container properly
[00:15:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so you mean to say there is no advantage from performance point of view ?
[00:15:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: no
[00:15:42] <Cork> lemonsparrow: coffiescript generates javascript before it is sent to the user
[00:15:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: then how come cs became so popular only for it's short syntax :-/
[00:16:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: cause ppl don't like the syntax i guess
[00:16:18] <Cork> i find it utterly pointless my self
[00:17:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: hmm... ok I am using jquery, js and DWR for ajax purposes in my project and as part of improving (suggesting some new things to improve the application) I suggested coffeescript.. assuming it improves performance apart from syntx... now I think it's pointless to use it
[00:18:46] <Cork> lemonsparrow: well it is always javascript in the end
[00:19:04] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is there something good you can suggest to me that I can include in my app from a front end perspective.... ??
[00:19:08] <lemonsparrow> Cork: right
[00:19:28] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that question is WAY to generic
[00:20:29] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yep but currently I use js, jquery, DWR... anything you think is new, cool and improves performance >??
[00:21:01] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not really
[00:21:13] <Cork> loading more things usually doesn't improve performance
[00:21:21] <Cork> you want to scale things down if you have performance problems
[00:21:35] <Cork> but check pref graphs over what happens
[00:21:44] <Cork> where you put your cpu time, load time and so on
[00:25:56] <johnkevinmbasco> hi guys, do you know other plugins that are similar to this one - http://deepliquid.com/projects/Jcrop/demos.php?demo=advanced ? a plugin that allows users to reposition profile image interactively
[00:27:40] <sathish>  Hi this is a question on Jquery validate, Can anyone please let me know, how I can access the error text inside the highlight and unhighlight sections
[00:40:47] <larsemil> i have a file named -> jquery.ui.accordion.js, need to update it. seems like its not a single file anymore. any hints on approach=
[00:41:48] <larsemil> s/=/?/
[00:42:32] <Cork> larsemil: it is an indifitual file, it depends if you download a contacted version or not
[00:43:17] <Cork> larsemil: http://jqueryui.com/download/all/
[00:44:32] <Snoopal> hey guys. whats the selector if i need to select all elements which have the "data-points" attribute set?
[00:44:38] <larsemil> Cork: thanks alot
[00:45:11] <Cork> Snoopal: $('[data-points]')
[00:45:19] <Snoopal> Thank you :)
[00:45:22] <Cork> Snoopal: though you most likely want to limit that
[00:45:29] <Cork> cause that will actually traverse the entire page
[00:46:00] <Snoopal> hmmm
[00:46:45] <Cork> the browser needs to grab each element, and then check it's attributes for that selector
[00:47:03] <Snoopal> if i have a div arround with #step-2 would it be faster to do #step-2 [data-points] ?
[00:47:11] <Cork> yes
[00:47:23] <Snoopal> roger that will try it :)
[00:47:25] <Snoopal> thanks :)
[00:47:49] <thinkxl> counting syllables on a string?
[00:49:42] <Cork> thinkxl: you would have to have a list of all syllables to do that as far as i know
[00:49:58] <thinkxl> regex could help?
[00:50:40] <Cork> sure
[00:50:41] <thinkxl> http://pastebin.com/7c0DetZU
[00:50:48] <thinkxl> got this, but is not accurate
[00:51:04] <Cork> prob cause it isn't complete
[00:51:07] <Cork> not sure
[00:53:18] <larsemil> Cork: thanks for the help. solved the problem.
[00:56:11] <neSo> Morning
[00:56:50] <neSo> I am using jquery.hover to change the opacity, now i am using media queries for mobile support.
[00:57:26] <neSo> The problem is, jquery keeps adding opacity:0 on mouse-out. even when i already specified opacity: 1 inside the query
[00:57:44] <neSo> Is there a way to prevent this code from running on smaller resolutions? Or is there a way to check for the currenct opacity?
[00:57:56] <Cork> neSo: so set a class instead, and then override what that class does in the query
[00:58:59] <neSo> so instead of using .css i should use .addClass?
[00:59:06] <Cork> yes
[00:59:11] <neSo> ok will do, cheers
[00:59:32] <Cork> neSo: also there is :hover in css :)
[00:59:41] <Cork> so you might not need .hover if that is all you do
[01:00:01] <neSo> I know, was trying some new things out
[01:00:08] <neSo> There's obviously an easier way haha
[01:17:57] <sathish>  Hi this is a question on Jquery validate, Can anyone please let me know, how I can access the error text inside the highlight callback/section
[01:21:53] <neSo> sathish: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2457032/jquery-validation-change-default-error-message ?
[01:34:21] <isuldor> I'm trying to select a next sibling ul object after a click event but "this ~ ul" seems very wrong. Any advice?
[01:34:52] <Cork> isuldor: $(this).nextAll('ul').first()
[01:35:09] <isuldor> oooh
[01:35:15] <isuldor> Cork: Thanks!
[01:35:39] <son> So, I heard that when an element is inside a "noscript" tag
[01:35:46] <son> its not in the DOM
[01:36:23] <son> Can I still query for that element with jQuery, using some kind of XPath expression?
[01:37:07] <Cork> son: it is in the dom
[01:37:19] <Cork> so yes you can select it
[01:37:32] <son> I tried but it gave me empty list
[01:37:35] <son> :-|
[01:38:08] <son> well let me double check it
[01:39:17] <Cork> son: hmm ya, interesting
[01:39:22] <son> You're right, Cork
[01:39:27] <son> Sorry :-)
[01:39:32] <son> It worked with jQuery
[01:39:51] <son> but not in another place
[01:40:04] <son> its not a jQuery problem
[01:40:06] <son> Thanks
[01:40:21] <Cork> son: no <noscript> doens't have dom for it's content http://jsfiddle.net/JD5bc/
[01:40:27] <sathish> neSo, Thank you very much, I will take a look at this and see how I can use this
[01:40:33] <Cork> son: http://jsfiddle.net/JD5bc/1/
[01:40:39] <Cork> son: so you where correct
[01:40:39] <son> checking it
[01:41:27] <son> OK, this is good info as well, Cork
[01:43:36] <son> Hmm, so in this case jQuery is too good because it was able to get me the result
[01:44:17] <son> jQuery("foo:contains(bar)") actually works
[01:44:53] <sathish> neSO, not sure how this will help me. I have a text box and it is attached to more than one rule/error message, now when the highlight callback fires, how do I find which of the rule/error message triggered the highlight callback
[01:45:50] <Cork> son: well that matches on the string in the content, not elements
[01:46:24] <son> right
[02:53:57] <code_ph0y> hey guys can someone tell me how do I calulate how far down a page I am
[02:55:44] <code_ph0y> is it scrollTop()?
[02:57:05] <Cork> code_ph0y: ya
[03:04:48] <code_ph0y> got it cork thanks a milion
[03:04:55] <code_ph0y> million*
[03:08:24] <test_> mh
[03:08:29] <test_> wohoo irc!
[03:23:26] <usc911> hey guys, quick question. I have a script that fades in a number of li items. I am just wondering if it is possible to have it loop over instead of just stopping at the last one? https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/f4140d757bc6f0c4a560
[03:24:35] <Cork> usc911: check if next() is length 0 and start over again if it is
[03:28:03] <krambiorix> hi, i have an array like jrdata[13].data[id] = x    and i want to delete this element  (jrdata[13].data[id] ) how can i do that?
[03:28:14] <usc911> Cork: cheers
[03:28:51] <Cork> krambiorix: you need to splice if you want to remove an element in an array
[03:29:00] <Cork> else you will have an undefined in the array
[03:29:17] <krambiorix> Cork,  but slice needs an index...
[03:29:31] <Cork> yes
[03:29:38] <Cork> and that would be the id
[03:29:44] <Cork> else you're not using an array
[03:30:05] <Cork> and array is always from 0 - length-1
[03:30:41] <Cork> krambiorix: so you do data.splice(id, 1)
[03:31:46] <Cork> krambiorix: or are do you actually mean your using an object?
[03:33:00] <krambiorix> Cork, nope
[03:33:19] <krambiorix> i want to remove elemnt by key from jrdata[13].data
[03:33:31] <Cork> krambiorix: arrays don't have keys
[03:33:35] <Cork> only objects do
[03:33:49] <Cork> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,9] is an array
[03:33:59] <Cork> { key: value } is an object
[03:34:09] <krambiorix> Cork, ow yes, ok then it's an object
[03:34:16] <Cork> then you use delete
[03:34:35] <Cork> delete jrdata[13].data[id]
[03:40:13] <sahbeewah> arrays are objects... array indices are object keys, fyi
[03:40:48] <Cork> sahbeewah: if you want to draw it that far, everything in js is an object
[03:41:04] <Cork> but you should never add keys to arrays, it will break things
[03:43:01] <sahbeewah> non-integer keys? well yeah nobody would ever do that
[03:43:25] <Cork> well you can break things by doing arr[i] too
[03:43:45] <Cork> var arr = []; arr[100] = 1; arr.length == 100
[03:44:07] <sahbeewah> that seems like expected behaviour
[03:44:34] <sahbeewah> probably 101
[03:44:38] <Cork> i've helped quite a few that didn't see it at that
[03:44:39] <Cork> no
[03:44:45] <Cork> oh sorry
[03:44:48] <Cork> yes 101
[03:45:04] <Cork> so the basic rule is to never set to an array to add things
[03:45:07] <Cork> always push
[03:45:12] <Cork> then you never get this problems
[04:02:36] <lemonsparrow> I have included two script tags for two js files in html and both the js files lie in the same folder... one file is loading and the other returns 404.. any idea why this is happening ? <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN"> <html><head> <title>404 Not Found</title> </head><body> <h1>Not Found</h1> <p>The requested URL /assets/js/dialog.js was not found on this server.</p> <p>Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was e
[04:02:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ^^
[04:04:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and you don't have anything rewriting things for you?
[04:04:32] <Cork> if no check the server logs for where the server is actually looking
[04:04:53] <Cork> well for yes too :)
[04:06:14] <lemonsparrow> Cork: Not Found  The requested URL /assets/js/dialog.js was not found on this server.  Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
[04:07:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: is that the response or the server log?
[04:07:10] <tobago> how to get double tap on iPad working?
[04:07:23] <Cork> the server log normally tells you the file path it tries to find it on
[04:09:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the path is wrong... but then how is it picking up the other file from wrong path then lol ?? :-/
[04:09:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you might have a cache or a script that rewrites the other url
[04:10:18] <Cork> (by "script" in a lose form, cause it depends on the server software your using)
[04:22:08] <amitprakash> what would be a css selector for a td with data-field set ? i.e. <td data-field='x'> should be selected but <td> should not be?
[04:24:22] <sahbeewah> amitprakash: api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector
[04:24:24] <Snoopal> what do you mean by "but <td> not" ?
[04:25:20] <amitprakash> Snoopal, well say I have two tds in a tbody, i want to select only those for which data-field is set to some value , not the ones without it being set
[04:26:09] <Snoopal> td[data-field=x]
[04:26:38] <amitprakash> Snoopal, except those require the value x, i don't care about the value as long as its not undefined
[04:27:07] <amitprakash> <td data-field='x'> should be selected but a simple <td> or a <td data-nonfield='x'> should not be selected
[04:27:29] <amitprakash> similarly, <td data-field='x'> or <td data-field='y'> should be selected
[04:29:38] <Snoopal> theb td[data-field!='']
[04:30:53] <amitprakash> this works :D
[04:30:54] <amitprakash> thanks
[04:31:08] <Snoopal> np
[04:32:08] <sahbeewah> no it doesn't
[04:33:30] <amitprakash> sahbeewah, you're right, it doesn't :(
[04:33:39] <amitprakash> can't have quotes there it seems
[04:34:04] <amitprakash> or rather td[data-field!='']
[04:34:13] <amitprakash> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #subitem_table td[data-field]!=""
[04:35:18] <amitprakash> sahbeewah, Snoopal $("#subitem_table td[data-field]")
[04:35:19] <amitprakash> this works
[04:36:19] <sahbeewah> that will select <td data-field>, as well
[04:37:48] <Cork> amitprakash: $('#subitem_table td').filter(function() { return $(this).data('field'); })
[04:38:05] <amitprakash> thats okay, thats as good as data-field=null , i just don't want the td
[04:38:15] <amitprakash> 's with the property not declared at all
[04:38:55] <amitprakash> Cork, thanks for that, did not know a filter function existed
[05:01:55] <ph88> how can i manipulate a slider for an acceptance test ?
[05:03:44] <Cork> ph88: acceptance test?
[05:03:52] <Cork> but yes you can manipulate the slider
[05:05:31] <ph88> i'm not sure if i should input the slider values into the JS, or if i should actually move the slider somehow (and thus include the slider script)  ?
[05:06:08] <Cork> ph88: what do you mean by acceptance test?
[05:07:30] <Cork> unless you actually need to test the mouse interaction you can do slider('option', 'values')
[05:07:48] <Cork> if you need to fake mouse events you prob want to use a test framework
[05:09:21] <ph88> Cork:   do you know selenium ?
[05:09:58] <Cork> ph88: i know of it, but i'm not very good with it
[05:09:59] <ph88> i need to test the complete website  = JS + PHP + database
[05:10:59] <ph88> ill google a bit for fake mouse events
[05:11:38] <Cork> ph88: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15339311/how-to-do-mouse-hover-using-selenium-webdriver-in-firefox-19

[05:13:26] <ph88> damn i hope i wont be programming java :|
[05:13:29] <ph88> well thx Cork  !
[05:13:34] <Cork> np
[05:27:28] <sekyms> Anyone know of a Sublime package that does exactly what the TidyUp button does in jsfiddle?
[05:29:10] <Cork> sekyms: well tidycss and tidyhtml should be two ones
[05:29:23] <Cork> and a prettify version for js
[05:29:44] <sekyms> any recommendations on the prettify?
[05:29:58] <Cork> html-css-js-prettifyer ?
[05:30:01] <Cork> haven't tried it
[05:30:40] <sekyms> yeah thats the one I saw
[05:30:43] <sekyms> ill give it a try
[05:31:07] <sekyms> thanks
[05:42:08] <bigbugjava> Hi, I'm appending a div inside a div, the appended div, dones't go inside that div.. ideas why?
[05:42:34] <Cork> bigbugjava: your not appending it to the element :)
[05:42:37] <Cork> please show the code
[05:44:56] <bigbugjava> Cork oh oh oh heheh I think your right, let me test if no succeed, willl send
[05:49:13] <bigbugjava> Cork ?
[05:49:26] <Cork> what?
[05:50:40] <bigbugjava> Cork - http://jsfiddle.net/Lcjtv/
[05:51:01] <bigbugjava> take in mind that node.js is needed to see the element, but you might figure that out
[05:51:59] <Cork> and the console.log line is giving you the correct info?
[05:59:47] <bigbugjava> Cork yeah
[06:00:02] <bigbugjava> Cork I have no issues, just the div element is misplaced
[06:00:22] <Cork> bigbugjava: and console.log($("div.fbstatus").length) is > 0 ?
[06:00:26] <bigbugjava> I already something like that with a table, but I created the elements durring the process... umm idea
[06:01:02] <bigbugjava> it's 1
[06:01:27] <Cork> then i don't see a reason why it wouldn't work
[06:01:49] <bigbugjava> yeah me 2, thats why it's wierd
[06:01:58] <bigbugjava> I will try to create the elemnt during the process
[06:07:37] <bigbugjava> Cork it was bootstrap span8
[06:07:40] <bigbugjava> did the problem
[06:25:35] <dwarder> i have this inside my function: var d = $.Deferred(); at the top, d.resolve(); inside success of the Ajax request and return d.promise(); at the bottom, why when i use this function like this $.when(myFunction()).then(function(){//ajax_data_still_not_here});
[06:26:00] <dwarder> i still don't have ajax data at //ajax_data_still_not_here
[06:26:32] <dwarder> what am i doing wrong?
[06:26:43] <dwarder> does the $.when work differently?
[06:27:59] <Cork> dwarder: no that should work
[06:39:51] <sekyms_> Can anyone confirm that if there is only a horizontal scroll bar on a page the scroll wheel scrolls this?
[06:40:44] <Cork> sekyms_: normally no
[06:41:01] <Cork> though that depends on the system and drivers and so on
[06:41:15] <sekyms_> on a mac with a trackpad it seems to be the case
[06:42:42] <sekyms_> which is really shitty for what I have been asked to do
[06:43:20] <Cork> sounds understandable, though not normal for other systems
[06:43:26] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[07:04:05] <VictorCL> :D
[07:06:58] <jeffszusz> hey guys - is there any known reason that jqueryElement.next() would actually return the previous element in the dom, and .prev() would return the next one?
[07:07:19] <Cork> jeffszusz: is this in ie?
[07:07:30] <jeffszusz> chrome
[07:07:36] <Cork> older ie's didn't use dom so you could get circular relations
[07:07:44] <Cork> jeffszusz: it can't happen in chrome
[07:07:58] <jeffszusz> and it works fine normally until i click on one of the items, after which the order is reversed
[07:08:02] <amcsi_work> hi
[07:08:13] <amcsi_work> does anyone know a tool for filling out a form with dummy data?
[07:08:16] <Cork> jeffszusz: are you moving elements in the dom when you click them?
[07:08:23] <jeffszusz> Cork, nope
[07:08:32] <Cork> jeffszusz: try reproduce the problem in a fiddle
[07:09:35] <Cork> jeffszusz: next() uses nextSibling
[07:09:49] <jeffszusz> Cork: well i'm pretty sure it's definitely a problem with our code base, I just don't know where I might even start looking
[07:09:54] <jeffszusz> hm
[07:10:07] <Cork> jeffszusz: make sure you arn't looking at a clone or something
[07:12:35] <lucenut> Hey guys, having trouble with a form validation scheme. http://staging2.expoplanner.com/test2.cfm
[07:13:16] <delboy1978uk1> hi guys any idea why i'm not seeing any jquery on this page? http://www.allagents.co.uk
[07:13:37] <lucenut> The class="required" validation rule "works", but for checkboxes what I really need to do is put a border around the div the set of checkboxes is in.
[07:13:45] <lucenut> How can I do that?
[07:15:05] <delboy1978uk1> i have that lucenut
[07:15:25] <delboy1978uk1> i would show you but the jquery on my page aint loading all of a sudden
[07:15:37] <lucenut> Hmm.
[07:16:02] <delboy1978uk1> if i get it back i have a form which uses jquery.validate and adds classes to the boxes
[07:16:05] <lucenut> Take your time. This has been bugging me for months. :-)
[07:16:27] <delboy1978uk1> you could probs browse the code, only it wont work atm
[07:16:51] <lucenut> OK, I guess that would work too if it highlights all the checkboxes.
[07:19:27] <lucenut> I thought I could do something like this: $('.required').closest('div').css('border', '2px solid red');
[07:19:57] <lucenut> Or this $('.required').closest('div').addClass('highlighted')
[07:20:18] <delboy1978uk1> lucenut, as well as rules andmessages, you can have errorPlacement
[07:20:20] <lucenut> If only I could get it to fire when the required validation failed.
[07:20:37] <delboy1978uk1> you can put in a fuction there
[07:20:48] <delboy1978uk1> http://www.allagents.co.uk/js/header.js
[07:21:01] <delboy1978uk1> search errorPlacement
[07:21:36] <delboy1978uk1> so you have div with 2+ checkboxes in?
[07:21:46] <lucenut> Yes.
[07:21:58] <lucenut> But I'm not a very experienced javascripter.
[07:22:11] <delboy1978uk1> $(element).parent().addClass('red-border'); ought to help you
[07:22:33] <delboy1978uk1> within the error placement function
[07:22:34] <dwarder> is it possible to stop execution of js in debugger when a certain var changes?
[07:22:44] <dwarder> chrome debugger
[07:22:46] <lucenut> Is that going to fire when the checkbox failes required validation?
[07:23:15] <delboy1978uk1> yes dwarder set a breakpoint where you want to start tracing and then you can step through or over each line
[07:23:19] <delboy1978uk1> yes
[07:23:24] <delboy1978uk1> yes lucenut
[07:23:29] <dwarder> delboy1978uk1: it means no
[07:24:21] <dwarder> delboy1978uk1: i want a virtual breakpoint, a trigger, when var changes it stops
[07:24:33] <delboy1978uk1> try this: $(var).change(function(){//here});
[07:24:47] <lucenut> So where do I put this delboy?
[07:24:53] <delboy1978uk1> usually i use that on actual dom elements but it should work
[07:27:14] <lucenut> I stuck it in a script block right before the /body
[07:27:26] <lucenut> Doesn't appear to do anything.
[07:27:51] <delboy1978uk1> sorry what did you paste? that .change() was for dwarder

[07:31:10] <dwarder> delboy1978uk1: thanks
[07:34:21] <delboy1978uk1> lucenut try something like this: http://pastie.org/8462863
[07:36:22] <delboy1978uk1> This should be the easiest problem ever but WTF!? 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$('input[type="text"]').placeholder()')
[07:37:53] <Nomikos> delboy1978uk1: something in placeholder() ?
[07:40:39] <delboy1978uk1> nope, it was fine before. jQuery is the first JS on the page but the web inspector network tab says a lot of resources status are (from cache) and time is 'Pending'
[07:41:00] <delboy1978uk1> http://www.allagents.co.uk this is it here
[07:41:21] <delboy1978uk1> try typing london in that first search box - nothing!
[07:50:39] <nafta> Velveeta: good morning
[07:50:40] <nafta> :D
[07:50:42] <nafta> you around?
[07:50:58] <nafta> I finally understood how to fix all this
[07:50:59] <nafta> haha
[07:54:02] <Quest> hi
[07:54:10] <lucenut> delboy, I tried to use what you gave me. http://staging2.expoplanner.com/test2.cfm
[07:54:16] <lucenut> What did I do wrong?
[07:57:27] <Quest> how to make the dragged element only be dropped in a droppable element. if its dragged else where, it goes back the the original parent. (would not be dragged).   http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/44/
[08:00:26] <delboy1978uk1> take that bottom one out and try this
[08:00:29] <delboy1978uk1> http://pastie.org/8462942
[08:01:33] <delboy1978uk1> what browser you using?
[08:02:04] <Quest> me?
[08:05:30] <delboy1978uk1> i think my page is NOT waiting for $(document).ready() ???
[08:07:44] <ajph> hey - can anyone tell me how i might simulate(trigger) a document.onclick event with query?
[08:08:23] <delboy1978uk1> sure? a button? $('#button_id').click(function(){  //do cool stuff!  });
[08:08:46] <BillCriswell> ajph: $(document).trigger('click')
[08:08:46] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a hover/css element but it's not working on touch in iPhone & iPad, is there a simple fix to replicate the action via touch on these devices?
[08:09:08] <BillCriswell> ajph: $('.weird-button').trigger('click')
[08:09:32] <ajph> BillCriswell: so clicking anything should trigger it?
[08:09:32] <delboy1978uk1> or just $('#button').click();
[08:09:49] <delboy1978uk1> that will click by itself
[08:10:07] <ajph> delboy1978uk1: this is document.click, not a specific selector
[08:10:16] <BillCriswell> ajph: Running that line of code would simulate a click on .weird-button.
[08:10:40] <delboy1978uk1> $(document).click(function(){  alert(document clicked!);  });
[08:11:11] <delboy1978uk1> $(document).click(function(){  alert("document clicked!");  }); //quotes
[08:11:18] <zizzl> side question: I have an anchor <a href="#" class="asdf"></a> and when I click it, it goes to the top of the page.. I want to use prevent default.. shouldn't this work $("a.asdf").click(function(event){event.preventDefault();});
[08:11:22] <ajph> delboy1978uk1: yes, that's to *listen* for the event - now how do i trigger it?
[08:11:36] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Yesh.
[08:11:37] <delboy1978uk1> $(document).click();
[08:11:38] <Quest> how to make the dragged element only be dropped in a droppable element. if its dragged else where, it goes back the the original parent. (would not be dragged).   http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/44/
[08:11:43] <BillCriswell> ajph: .trigger()
[08:11:48] <BillCriswell> .trigger('click')
[08:11:52] <delboy1978uk1> leave the closure function from it
[08:12:03] <zizzl> BillCriswell, is it ok to ONLY have prevent default?
[08:12:09] <zizzl> all examples I see have something else in there
[08:12:10] <delboy1978uk1> .click() triggers a click
[08:12:11] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Don't see why not.
[08:13:48] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk1: From whatI can tell .click() on a jQuery object just uses trigger anyway. Doing $el[0].click() would make more sense.
[08:14:02] <lucenut> delboy do you mean replace the bottom script with this one, or try and put this into my validate block at the top?
[08:14:18] <delboy1978uk1> i have a window onload event that loads non essential JS to the end of the dom. however $(document).ready() stuff is firing BEFORE this stuff has finished loading! Can I fix this somehow?
[08:14:48] <delboy1978uk1> yeah that bit at the bottom on its own, get rid of it
[08:15:30] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk1: document.ready is for when the dom is ready to be manipulated, not for when evertyhing is loaded. You'd probably want do do $(window).load() if you need to wait for those scripts.
[08:16:19] <delboy1978uk1> ah righ ok cheers Bill
[08:18:14] <lucenut> OK, I got rid of the script at the bottom and replaced my validate block at the top with yours.
[08:18:28] <lucenut> I don't get any errors, but I don't get any form validation either.

[08:55:23] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ feels right. Not 100% sure it's what's needed though. Don't mess around with it too often.
[08:56:10] <NoiseEee> ahh BillCriswell, thanks, found http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/

[08:58:55] <BillCriswell> lucenut: Missing a , after debug: true maybe?
[09:01:16] <lucenut> Hmm. delboy gave me this script. That fixed my error, but still don't get anything highlighted around the chakboxes.
[09:01:23] <NoiseEee> next, any way to make .ajaxComplete() callback fire *before* the xhr.done() callback???
[09:01:32] <lucenut> Now I get [11:00:12.957] Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. @ https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.2/jquery.min.js:17

[09:09:15] <grafi> It's like super important !!!1
[09:09:18] <grafi> :P
[09:10:22] <BillCriswell> grafi: agreeeed!!11one
[09:10:28] <BillCriswell> lucenut: http://jsbin.com/iZabIKu/1/edit?html,js,output does this help?
[09:10:33] <grafi> x)
[09:11:56] <lucenut> That's cool Bill!
[09:18:40] <lucenut> But it's kinda outside the jquery validate thing right?
[09:19:17] <lucenut> But I can't even get it to work outside that jsbin. http://staging2.expoplanner.com/test3.cfm
[09:33:32] <BillCriswell> lucenut: You can't do $('form') until jQuery can get to it, you would need to wrap your code in $(function(){ .... }); if you want to keep it in the header, that's jQuery's callback for when you have access to the DOM.
[09:36:56] <Basti> Hi there, i've a confusing issue.. let me explain:
[09:37:20] <Basti> 	$( ".showHide" ).click(function( event ) { 		$(this).parent().next(".job_content").slideToggle(); 	});
[09:38:39] <Basti> thats my code and I've 20 showHide links on my page.. and for any reason this function repeats 2 times for one job_content div when i click the link
[09:38:42] <Basti> why??
[09:38:56] <Basti> 20* times
[09:41:04] <Basti> Anybody any hint?
[09:45:07] <duch_kazatel> Basti show code.  jsfiddle.
[09:46:03] <BillCriswell> Basti: Guessing some HTML nested shittily.
[09:46:04] <d8bhatta> Hi guys
[09:46:36] <d8bhatta> I want to track click event by element name ( usefule in case of checkbox)..so how can i mention this isn jquery
[09:47:16] <d8bhatta> jQuery("#id").click(function(){ //my code }); is by id..i need same but with element  name
[09:47:17] <BillCriswell> $(':checkbox').on('change', function(){ console.log( this.name ); });
[09:47:38] <BillCriswell> d8bhatta: ^
[09:48:04] <d8bhatta> BillCriswell: I will have multiple checkboxes of different type
[09:48:17] <d8bhatta> so how can I address one type in that script
[09:48:42] <grafi> and here i though checkboxes were of type checkbox x)
[09:49:41] <BillCriswell> d8bhatta: You could do like... :checkbox.someClass I guess
[09:49:51] <BillCriswell> or maybe .someClass:checkbox ?
[09:49:52] <d8bhatta> grafi:  yes..checkboxes are of type checkbox..no doubt but I will have diffeent checkboxes like gender , have interest
[09:49:55] <BillCriswell> One or the other.
[09:51:27] <grafi> all my money on .someClass:checkbox

[09:59:48] <JFranks> Oh man. Had so many issues.. All good now. ;)
[10:01:40] <jop008> Any reason why google is not defined?
[10:02:57] <JFranks> jop008: Google doesn't eat enough proteins to get the definition that most people would seek.
[10:03:24] <jop008> :-)
[10:03:51] <jop008> so how to improve and show some map?
[10:10:42] <Dwarf> I'm trying to fade images into view as you scroll, but so far I've only been able to fade all images in. How would I do it with the image that triggers the event? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0ce17514027088a2d10f

[10:27:32] <matty432_> If you guys could choose to work for 40k a year working full time or working parttime a year for 20k which would you prefer?
[10:29:35] <BillCriswell> matty432_: I like working, so full time.
[10:34:35] <grafi> 40k is not enough though :DD
[10:35:22] <tw2113> so 30hr/wk at 20k, or 40hr/wk at 40k?
[10:35:36] <thinkxl> any way to simplify this: var tkn = bodyText.replace(/\s\./g, '.').replace(/\s\,/g, '.').split(' ').length ?
[10:35:46] <grafi> tw2113 that sounds like a terrible deal ^^
[10:35:46] <tw2113> full time gets you twice as much for a 1/3rd more work
[10:36:08] <grafi> parttime is clearly ohne 20h/wk
[10:36:08] <grafi> :P
[10:36:23] <tw2113> not according to businesses that i've seen
[10:36:46] <tw2113> who knows
[10:36:52] <grafi> no one knows
[10:37:00] <grafi> to quote queens of the stone age
[10:37:17] <matty432_> i mean 20 hours a week for part time

[10:40:57] <Whirl3d> Does anyone have a suggestion for a scalable e-commerce platform that allows multiple store fronts and which uses jquery to implement the front end?
[10:41:18] <grafi> no
[10:41:28] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: jQuery to implement the front-end?
[10:44:00] <Whirl3d> jquery to handle the user interface bells and whistles. My client has some specific hangups about existing ecommerce solutions that are mostly front-end (superficial)
[10:44:36] <mgreenberg> I have a page that has query 1.7 and 1.8 on it…I want to remove those and just drop in 1.10…any suggestions on a good way to go about this ? I thought about writing test cases in jTestDriver but just trying not to make this too tedious if at all possible
[10:46:32] <grafi> Whirl3d sounds like a breeze to work with xD
[10:47:14] <Whirl3d> Tell me about it. The problem is that this could be big. We just got an endorsement from the president of the US and to be honest, I am not competent to handle it.
[10:47:57] <grafi> so obama wants to sell some obama mugs? xD
[10:48:34] <sekyms> Whirl3d that sounds like a nightmare
[10:48:42] <sekyms> If I had to do ecomerece I think I would try to use squarespace
[10:48:45] <grafi> i mean what does that even mean, have an interface that makes use of ajax?
[10:49:38] <Whirl3d> Kind of mugs, more like bumper stickers. We have a new product that literally cleans the environment just by sitting there.
[10:50:39] <sekyms> Whirl3d: generally when someone says E-Commerce I say I have to use the bathroom and don't come back
[10:50:51] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: I used to work at an ecommerce agency, before you just pick something because it's scalable get to know what you're selling first and do some research from there.
[10:51:07] <Whirl3d> And like the idiot I am, I suggested a really creative way to handle the hub that everyone is excited about but which I don't know any way to implement.
[10:51:19] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Ouch.
[10:51:24] * sekyms plays sad trombone
[10:52:05] <sekyms> Whirl3d: is there any way you can pass blame on to someone else?
[10:52:15] <Whirl3d> Let me explain the idea and see if you think this a jquery thing or not..
[10:52:36] <grafi> sekyms lol
[10:52:52] <sekyms> Whirl3d: use square market!
[10:52:55] <grafi> Whirl3d go ahead, i will steal your idea now and be a billionaire
[10:53:01] <Whirl3d> Behind the storefront I want a scrollable collection of buildings that represent famous buildings in cities across the US.
[10:53:03] <rocky> is there a popular well-maintained jquery plugin for manipulating the shebang and back history management?
[10:53:10] <BillCriswell> I plan to steal it and do it poorly.
[10:53:32] <grafi> BillCriswell that's always worth something
[10:53:33] <grafi> :P
[10:53:34] <sekyms> history.js rocky
[10:53:45] <sekyms> and no its not well maintained anymore
[10:53:48] <sekyms> but it works
[10:53:54] <grafi> feature complete
[10:54:17] <Whirl3d> they start out grungy and dirty and as folks sell these products, they appear in the background attached to various building and/or vehicles . the area around the items will slowly get cleaner and cleaner.
[10:54:41] <sekyms> OMG Whirl3d what have you done!
[10:54:48] <Whirl3d> The idea is that companies will be embarrassed by their dirty virtual building if they don't buy the product. LOL
[10:55:17] <grafi> oO
[10:55:24] <grafi> i dont even
[10:55:25] <grafi> ^^
[10:55:37] <sekyms> Whirl3d: are you freelance or full time?
[10:55:41] <Whirl3d> It will be a layered 2-D scrollable and it should be available for more than just the storefront. I could see lots of people wanting a cool scrollable background for their site.
[10:55:48] <Whirl3d> Freelance, man of luxury
[10:55:58] <sekyms> ABORT ABORT ABORT
[10:56:01] <Whirl3d> lol
[10:56:01] <grafi> xD
[10:56:02] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Do these companies have accounts they login to and then you have some data to see what they bought?
[10:56:21] <grafi> if so, always cc: the nsa oô
[10:56:32] <sekyms> Wouldn't you get sued for representing the companies with buildings?
[10:56:55] <Whirl3d> The scrollable city thing would be separate. Occasionally a car would drive by or someone walking their dog...very cute cartoonish.
[10:57:14] <sekyms> Whirl3d: what have you got yourself into.
[10:57:35] <grafi> how is that selling anything xD
[10:57:49] <Whirl3d> I figure a factory object that produces the "building" objects and connnects them linearly is not going to be difficult.
[10:57:52] <sekyms> its a ui to incentevise people to buy
[10:57:54] <BillCriswell> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:58:25] <grafi> BillCriswell dat face
[10:58:26] <grafi> :P
[10:58:52] <sekyms> Sounds like a cool project
[10:59:03] <Whirl3d> There are organizations like CleanCities that would use it in their background. Then as other organizations sign on and implement clean city projects, you'd see it happen  to your city in the background.
[10:59:32] <Whirl3d> Trees Atlanta has already agreed to use our hub to implement all of their advertising because it saves the environment.
[10:59:34] <sekyms> you know that thing when where guys think with their dick and get themseleves in trouble?
[10:59:55] <Whirl3d> So, a new tree would get planted every time they do a new planting, for example.
[10:59:59] <grafi> so basically you are trying to build another medicare.gov :P
[11:00:01] <sekyms> I believe you have done the same thing with the creative portion of your brain
[11:00:07] <Whirl3d> grafi, LOL
[11:00:16] <Whirl3d> sekyms, no doubt
[11:00:19] <usulix> Well, for what it is worth..... @Whirl3d.... I suggest u take a look at easel.js
[11:00:25] <usulix> http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS

[11:00:57] <grafi> you werent planting trees
[11:00:58] <grafi> :P
[11:01:03] <usulix> sekyms: :-(
[11:01:11] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: When these companies log in do they see other peoples buildings and how clean or dirty they are?
[11:01:13] <sekyms> it;s good but I found it lacking certain things
[11:01:26] <sekyms> Whirl3d: this is going to be responsive right?
[11:01:42] <sekyms> usulix: I also found the documentation frustrating
[11:01:51] <Whirl3d> The clean and dirty aspect would be for our website. I see this being a subscribable service option. Not everyone would see the dirt.
[11:02:01] <usulix> sekyms: I agree about the docs.
[11:02:11] <Whirl3d> THe background will not be responsive to the user, no.
[11:02:17] <BillCriswell> You're lost me I think.
[11:02:20] <grafi> the facebook of citycleaning
[11:02:21] <grafi> oô
[11:02:24] <sekyms> That being said, I would probably use it again, as you said it's probably the best one out there
[11:02:44] <sekyms> Whirl3d: did you tell them end of next week?
[11:02:57] <usulix> but, I tried Kenetic.js first... thought it was better... but ran into a persistent empty canvas problem on chrome
[11:03:03] <grafi> in this case Whirl3d was developer and marketing dept
[11:03:03] <grafi> xD
[11:03:12] <Whirl3d> So, imagine a service where you could subscribe to a background image...The image would change every once in a while and you could just run it in the background of your website...
[11:03:28] <Whirl3d> Now imagine that the image was actually a visual representation of your city.
[11:03:38] <sekyms> usulix I have also used kinetic and like it better, better documentation, better demos, less features though
[11:03:51] <Whirl3d> As time passes, the buildings slowly move left to right and you get a peek into the city and what's going on...
[11:03:51] <grafi> sure thing, how do you know when the city plants a tree? ^^
[11:04:08] <sekyms> Tree API
[11:04:12] <sekyms> I will be rich!
[11:04:16] <grafi> xD
[11:04:22] <sekyms> RESTree
[11:04:23] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Is all this in plans to sell more of the product?
[11:04:36] <grafi> RESTree API v0.21234.3
[11:04:48] <usulix> sekyms: if chrome fixed the canvas bug... which they probably have by now... I guess kinetic might be better for those reasons
[11:04:48] <BillCriswell> You're selling something, aren't you? I feel like that part is getting pushed to the side.
[11:04:51] <Whirl3d> So, if you have a cleaning business and want to advertise in the city, you'd pay to have a cleaning truck come by with your logo and perhaps a short cleaning animation.
[11:04:54] <grafi> I think it way too much effort
[11:05:17] <sekyms> usulix I made a tech demo with kinetic where a monkey runs around eats bananas on a trble clef
[11:05:37] <BillCriswell> Does the monkey poop?
[11:05:40] <Whirl3d> I am hoping to develop  a simple api that will allow me to let other developers encapsulate short animations that, once approved, can be added to the stream of objects that represent the city.
[11:05:49] <sekyms> no but there is a spider that goes up his web
[11:06:07] <sekyms> Whirl3d: this sounds like a ginormous project
[11:06:11] <usulix> sekyms: nice
[11:06:12] <grafi> medicare
[11:06:13] <BillCriswell> Eh, that's not fun.
[11:06:16] <grafi> woamp womp
[11:06:17] <grafi> :P
[11:06:35] <sekyms> Whirl3d: you need to back track fast
[11:06:43] <sekyms> break it into manageable pieces
[11:07:03] <grafi> just be paid half in front and fly to another country
[11:07:03] <grafi> :P
[11:08:22] <sekyms> you know thats not as crazy as it sounds
[11:08:27] <Whirl3d> I figure I will start with the building code that scrolls a linear series of static images slowly in the background. THat should be easy, right?
[11:08:32] <sekyms> you can live like a king in some countries on very little money
[11:08:48] <BillCriswell> Whirl3d: Easy is a VERY relative term.
[11:08:50] <sekyms> Whirl3d: there has to be some paralax code out there you can use for that
[11:09:16] <Whirl3d> Then the code implemented on the site would simply grab the series of linear images from the main server and render them in the background.
[11:09:17] <grafi> sekyms has done his research :P
[11:09:28] <Lewix> anyone used the jquery-ui-multiselect-widget before?
[11:09:50] <sekyms> Whirl3d: so they are supposed to design their site around a background they dont know what will look like
[11:10:01] <Whirl3d> Then, once I have the seamless background, I can set a team of people up to generate the coherent images so they all look the same and have the same boundaries, etc.
[11:10:31] <Whirl3d> If you have a site with no background, this would make your site rock.
[11:10:41] <sekyms> depends
[11:10:52] <sekyms> or it could clash hard
[11:10:58] <sekyms> or text could be invisible
[11:11:00] <grafi> i always wanted to load an extra 45mb to have a background :D
[11:11:04] <Whirl3d> Then you wouldn't use it.
[11:11:22] <sekyms> i would think you would have to also offer templates for sites
[11:11:47] <Whirl3d> It should be a simple script that fetches a series of urls, caches the images, then scrolls them. Hardly 46mb
[11:12:10] <sekyms> i would also worry about browser performance
[11:12:14] <sekyms> are you thinking canvas?
[11:12:20] <sekyms> what browsers do you have to support
[11:13:03] <Whirl3d> wait. So you are trying to tell me that NOTHING like this has ever been done before? I can't believe that. No one has ever created a subscription backgorund image service?
[11:13:20] <sekyms> when you say it like that it makes it sound crazy
[11:13:36] <sekyms> im not telling you which part sounds crazy though
[11:14:01] <Whirl3d> lol
[11:14:25] <Lewix> http://www.erichynds.com/examples/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/demos/#basic how to add optgroup?
[11:14:48] <sekyms> oh man erich used to frequent this channel
[11:14:56] <sekyms> I think he lives down the street from me too
[11:17:09] <Whirl3d> usulix, thanks for the easejs link. I'll use it for the prototype at least.
[11:17:23] <sekyms> Whirl3d: you are going to run into issues in older browsers
[11:17:48] <sekyms> better have a static image fallback
[11:17:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah, if so, I'll have the service return a "backup" url with a single image
[11:18:11] <Whirl3d> sekyms, thanks. I will keep that in mind.
[11:18:52] <sekyms> Whirl3d: we may tease you now, but someday when we are all paying for your super animated background images, you will be laughing
[11:19:14] <Whirl3d> LOL. I would just like to save the world...lol
[11:19:33] <Whirl3d> but thanks for the advice and the teasing anyways.
[11:19:43] <grafi_> sekyms we will get free lifetime access
[11:19:46] <grafi_> of course
[11:20:03] <Whirl3d> If that sounded catty, it wasn't meant that way. I really do appreciate the input.
[11:20:04] <sekyms> Whirl3d: also look into parallaxing
[11:20:16] <grafi_> paralysing
[11:20:47] <Whirl3d> Yeah, I have use Parallax to implement a pseudo-3D "wiggler" effect for rendering 3D images from stereo pairs.
[11:21:03] <sekyms> paralaxing would work for your car idea
[11:21:11] <Whirl3d> http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS/demos/alphamask
[11:21:11] <sekyms> car moves faster then background it is on
[11:21:20] <Whirl3d> That should work for the grungy effect!
[11:21:27] <Whirl3d> for sure
[11:22:15] <Whirl3d> ideally, each building will be able to have a little animation if speed permits. In other words, a little person could peak their head out a window and water a flower or something.
[11:22:53] <Whirl3d> If I build the base and release an api that handles the load balancing, I think it could be a really cool thing.
[11:23:02] <sekyms> its a nice idea
[11:23:31] <sekyms> i just worry about browser performance
[11:23:38] <grafi_> true
[11:24:55] <sekyms> but I work with IE 7 and IE 8 everyday
[11:25:34] <Whirl3d> Hopefully I can build that into the script to handle performance issues with fallbacks.
[11:26:14] <Whirl3d> I did something like this for a website that had graffitti messages.  I would render the graffitti messages as pngs and then cycle through them dynamically.
[11:26:18] <sekyms> if you do use easeljs you will need to use excanvas
[11:26:35] <sekyms> link
[11:27:02] <Whirl3d> They got into trouble and had to take it down.
[11:27:28] <Whirl3d> I should have made a filter for the render engine and after some terrorist and x-rated things made it onto the site, they got upset
[11:27:29] <Whirl3d> LOL
[11:28:44] <Whirl3d> looking up excanvas now.
[11:29:03] <sekyms> its just a library that ports canvas support bacl to IE 8 and IE 7
[11:29:34] <jop008> Someone an example page using google maps I looked over all plugins I could find
[11:30:08] <sekyms> I wish this recruiter would call me back already...
[11:30:10] <Whirl3d> I am actually really okay with the message:: "this site uses the latest technology and can't be displayed on your browser, upgrade or use the small bus version..."
[11:30:14] <sekyms> something no one says ever?
[11:31:24] <grafi> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/47312549/lol.JPG
[11:31:40] <Whirl3d> I can't believe these stock image houses don't offer a subscription background image rotator service. It totally seems like common sense way to secure advertising..
[11:31:45] <grafi> bieber no more
[11:37:24] <sekyms> this client seems to render images in-line
[11:37:30] <sekyms> that seems rather dangerous
[11:39:51] <BillCriswell> That was a good beer.

[11:42:57] <BillCriswell> sekyms: The last two places I worked really didn't have issues with a 20 minute beer break.
[11:43:34] <BillCriswell> I think that's plenty fair for people who don't smoke haha.

[11:44:43] <tables> i want to 1) read messages i already posted  2) post more messages  3) refresh to load more messages    just like twitter      is there anything written out there already that does this?
[11:45:25] <sekyms> Whirl3d: if you plan on using that technique I recomend you read this: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/
[11:46:08] <BillCriswell> sekyms: This information is 2 hours old. How about you post something a little more up to date.
[11:46:22] <sekyms> BillCriswell: I know, major fail on my part
[11:46:32] <sekyms> BillCriswell: next time I will post something from the future
[11:48:21] <Whirl3d> sekyms, that's a great article. Thanks.
[11:48:47] <sekyms> You should thank Paul he's usually in here

[12:07:19] <sekyms> Z3R0: are you perplexed at how fast it charges also?
[12:09:23] <Whirl3d> Shocking, where is the old jquery group? Usually, you'd be getting language warnings--this is a family channel.
[12:10:41] <sekyms> I saw jslint leave earlier
[12:10:47] <sekyms> so thats where all the warnings went
[12:12:10] <culh> Say I've a listener for link clicks, like $('#id a').on('click', function(e) { ... }); and I just want to add a css class to that anchor: the function would include the line $(this).addClass('cssClass');  So now I want to removeClass() from all other anchors that are also children from the same parent as the first anchor represented by $(this).  QUESTION: do I have to go through them all with
[12:12:10] <culh> $(this).parent('div > a').removeClass('')  OR is there a better way?
[12:12:50] <Velveeta> are they direct children of that anchor?
[12:12:56] <culh> no
[12:13:06] <Velveeta> er i mean
[12:13:11] <Velveeta> are they direct children of the div
[12:13:15] <culh> direct children of that anchor's parent, like 'brothers' if you will
[12:13:18] <culh> yes.
[12:13:19] <Velveeta> gotcha
[12:13:25] <duch_kazatel> like 'siblings'?
[12:13:34] <culh> offspring
[12:13:36] <duch_kazatel> .siblings() might help.
[12:13:38] <Velveeta> you could do $(this).addClass('cssClass').siblings('.cssClass').removeClass('cssClass')
[12:13:38] <Whirl3d> $(this).siblings().removeClass()
[12:13:42] <culh> mostly bastards ;)
[12:13:42] <Velveeta> rightio
[12:13:48] <duch_kazatel> .siblings('a) might help.
[12:13:52] <Velveeta> `api siblings @culh
[12:13:52] <b-ot> culh: .siblings(): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[12:13:59] <duch_kazatel> err .siblings('a')
[12:14:00] <culh> ty!
[12:14:42] <Whirl3d> or even better $(this).siblings(oldclass).removeClass(oldclass);
[12:15:23] <Whirl3d> or is that better? Is it better to only select the siblings of the oldclass or just do it to all of them?
[12:15:36] <culh> How about if the siblings are those with or without the cssClass in question?
[12:16:00] <Velveeta> i would probably filter the set of elements, but who knows, write a jsperf and see what's more performant ;)
[12:16:17] <Velveeta> culh: what do you mean?
[12:16:19] <culh> As in: when I've clicked the first time the cssClass is added, then I clicked the second time and I first want to remove the cssClass from all then ad to the $(this) node
[12:17:00] <Velveeta> but you don't need to remove from all, because all may not have it, you just need to remove from the ones that have it
[12:17:03] <culh> 2 lines of jq sorts it out, just wondering if it's not overkill or somethin
[12:17:08] <Velveeta> i'm gonna write a jsperf to test speed, because now i'm curious :)
[12:17:16] <culh> indeed
[12:18:01] <grafi> overachiever Velveeta
[12:18:02] <grafi> :p
[12:18:10] <Whirl3d> There's a tipping point I am sure
[12:18:46] <Whirl3d> if you have 10000 siblings and use the removeClass() method on all of them, but only need to do it on one, it's got to be faster to select the one and removeClass, right?
[12:18:50] <Joey__> I don't want to a full blown ajax, but I need to update a text in the client based on the completion of a task on the server
[12:18:56] <Whirl3d> But it might not make a difference on 5 for example.
[12:19:08] <Joey__> is there something to start a timer, do a get, and update an element
[12:19:16] <Joey__> or is that something to write ?
[12:19:31] <culh> Whirl3d: It's for about 30, a calendar. But it's good to know
[12:19:50] <Joey__> I would like to have this inline in the element as well
[12:19:59] <grafi> so its proably to little elements to matter :P
[12:20:17] <Whirl3d> I have found that using CSS, it's sometimes better to manage the parent class and removeClass once.
[12:20:43] <grafi> yeah
[12:20:45] <culh> Whirl3d: $(this).addClass('active').siblings('active').removeClass('active');  //this only keeps adding the class and doens't remove
[12:21:10] <Whirl3d> because it's .siblings(".active");
[12:21:14] <grafi> xD
[12:21:34] <culh> that makes sense
[12:21:41] <Whirl3d> add the . before the class selector in .siblings()
[12:21:49] <culh> Same result, though.
[12:21:52] <grafi> oO
[12:22:00] <culh> -_-
[12:22:43] <Whirl3d> try var el=$(this); el.siblings().removeClass("active"); el.addClass('active");
[12:23:04] <nafta> Velveeta: you around? :D
[12:23:12] <Velveeta> yep, hold on a minute though
[12:23:30] <nafta> I'm trying to get each tweet id when I click on it...but I'm always getting the same ID...the first one on the list....O_o

[12:25:59] <grafi> not sure if that translates well :P
[12:26:44] <culh> I think siblings() doesn't work for children with more than 1 inwood level of parenting
[12:26:57] <culh> or some other term more suitable for describing what I meant...
[12:27:12] <shoky> siblings===have same direct parent

[12:27:29] <BillCriswell> A siblings child would be your cousin.
[12:27:37] <Velveeta> ok people, i have your verdict
[12:27:47] <culh> hear ye
[12:28:11] <Velveeta> in the case of the people vs siblings with and without filters, i decree that in a test case of 10 nodes, 100 nodes, and over 2000 nodes, no filter outperformed filtered each time
[12:28:14] <BillCriswell> Wu-Tang Clan Pandora was an excellent choice.
[12:28:18] <Quest> how to solve line 9, http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/46/   that is how to find out the initial parent of element before it was moved to the target parent. ? I can get the moved element id and target element id but not the initial parent.?
[12:29:05] <Velveeta> and it got to be wider and wider margins with each increase in nodes… with a little over 2000 nodes, nonfiltered was almost twice the speed as filtered
[12:29:06] <grafi> nafta works for me
[12:29:34] <culh> Velveeta: sounds right
[12:29:49] <culh> is that for jq or cigarretes?

[12:33:22] <culh> mental stability is overrated.
[12:33:47] <BillCriswell> Agreed.
[12:33:49] <grafi> Quest what are you doing?
[12:33:55] <khodgson> hah, my doctor dissagreed
[12:34:03] <grafi> 9/10 doctors do
[12:34:10] <grafi> but there's always that one guy
[12:34:15] <grafi> :P
[12:34:19] <culh> medication is also overrated
[12:34:21] <culh> :p
[12:34:23] <khodgson> was that MJ's doctor?
[12:34:25] <grafi> says your brain
[12:34:37] <grafi> is he still a doctor?
[12:34:49] <Quest> grafi,  how to solve line 9, http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/46/   that is how to find out the initial parent of element before it was moved to the target parent. ?
[12:34:55] <khodgson> I think he in jail
[12:35:31] <Velveeta> quest: that data doesn't appear to come through in the drop event
[12:35:40] <Quest> Velveeta,  then?
[12:36:25] <Velveeta> quest: you may need to set up a drag start event to bind up some data to the element that drop can later read maybe
[12:36:46] <Quest> Velveeta,  hm how?
[12:37:00] <Velveeta> MJ's doctor is free at last, free at last, he was a gorilla for halloween
[12:37:02] <Velveeta> with cornrows
[12:37:06] <culh> MJ's doctor is now the physician for Jackson Four
[12:37:08] <Velveeta> saw it on tmz, i did
[12:37:27] <Velveeta> quest: off the top of my head, i'm not sure, but that's where i would start looking
[12:37:54] <Quest> something like $('.task').draggable({ revert: "invalid" , alert($(e.currentTarget).attr('id')); });
[12:38:15] <Velveeta> well you would need to add a start function to that
[12:38:19] <Quest> replace e.curr.. with this
[12:38:24] <Velveeta> to bind the element's parent to it as a piece of data
[12:38:26] <Quest> $this
[12:38:34] <Velveeta> and then read that data property in your droppable drop event
[12:39:17] <Quest> Velveeta,  why not just read by $this?
[12:39:35] <Velveeta> i have no idea which $this you're referring to
[12:41:01] <shoky> Quest: ui.draggable.parent().attr('id')
[12:41:14] <Quest> Velveeta,  can I grabe the initial parent by this $('.task').draggable({ revert: "invalid"  }); ?
[12:41:17] <shoky> before you append it to the new one, of course
[12:41:23] <Quest> shoky,  oh
[12:41:26] <Velveeta> yeah i was just noticing that he was manually doing $(ui.draggable).detach() in his drop function
[12:41:43] <culh> Is it benchmark worthy to test for (.length > 0)  before using functions that go through DOM, such as find and etc?
[12:42:01] <Velveeta> culh what do you mean?
[12:42:03] <shoky> culh: no need to check
[12:43:02] <culh> Velveeta: if($('#calendar a.active').length > 0) { $('#calendar a.active').removeClass('active') }
[12:43:18] <culh> But for other cases not so obvious aswell
[12:43:19] <Quest> shoky,  thanks. works
[12:43:24] <Quest> Velveeta,  thank too
[12:44:08] <culh> I'd assign a variable for the selector btw, that I know improves performance
[12:44:44] <Velveeta> culh: nah, don't bother length checking it
[12:45:00] <Velveeta> it'll just try to iterate over an empty collection before even dispatching that method, and it won't do anything
[12:49:14] <maZtah> anyone knows a good plugin to "lock" or "fix" both table rows and table columns?
[12:54:16] <culh> thanks, l8r
[12:56:56] <krambiorix> hi , when i do delete jrdata[13].data[id][index]   -> this leaves me with  jrdata[13].data[id]   ... So it deletes all indexes .... What can i do?
[12:57:28] <grafi> o.o
[13:00:02] <krambiorix> so i delete in fact  jrdata[13].data[id][1]   but jrdata[13].data[id][0] has also been removed
[13:00:42] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how to read that
[13:00:58] <Quest> shoky,  line 13, http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/48/     how can i revert if some condition is not met. revert == do not drag and drop?
[13:01:05] <Quest> Velveeta, ^
[13:02:15] <Velveeta> google is your friend: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3088485/how-to-revert-position-of-a-jquery-ui-draggable-based-on-condition
[13:02:29] <Quest> hm
[13:02:43] <krambiorix> Velveeta, ?
[13:03:21] <Velveeta> krambiorix: i'm not understanding what you're asking up above
[13:05:37] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: make a fiddle
[13:05:49] <krambiorix> Velveeta , i want to  delete jrdata[13].data[id][1]  , (index 1) but when i do that it deletes all indexes (also 0)
[13:06:06] <Velveeta> i call shenanigans
[13:06:19] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: indeed, prove it on a fiddle.
[13:06:31] <Velveeta> first of all, is that an array index you're trying to delete?
[13:07:02] <Velveeta> because you should probably use something like array.splice for that
[13:07:24] <Quest> Velveeta,  shoky  ok, why line 15 is not reverting? http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/49/
[13:07:27] <Velveeta> if it's a numerically-keyed object map then yeah, use delete, or else set it to undefined
[13:07:31] <BillCriswell> splice is such a bad ass word.
[13:08:06] <Velveeta> quest: i pasted a stackoverflow link that showed you exactly what you needed to do...
[13:08:21] <Quest> Velveeta,  yes. checked it. the method is same that iam using
[13:08:54] <Velveeta> no, you're looking at the part of the question where he says it didn't work
[13:09:00] <Velveeta> look at the accepted answer
[13:10:50] <Z3R0> Velveeta I don't know if that is what he is trying to do...
[13:10:55] <Z3R0> he's trying to revert AFTER a successful drop
[13:11:14] <shoky> wat
[13:11:41] <Z3R0> aren't you ?
[13:11:42] <Velveeta> but if he's trying to revert after a successful drop, then it's not a successful drop
[13:11:50] <Velveeta> or at least it shouldn't be considered one
[13:12:13] <Quest> Velveeta,  http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/50/          i need to call that after i get all the ids inSIDE the drop: function
[13:12:27] <Z3R0> yea he's basically making a repeated event
[13:12:35] <Z3R0> you drop someone, the drop: event will do something, then the item will go back
[13:12:37] <Z3R0> something*
[13:12:51] <Velveeta> then that logic should be moved to the accept event
[13:13:03] <Velveeta> change the word drop: to accept:, and return false from that function
[13:13:43] <Quest> hm
[13:13:50] <shoky> and don't put one option inside another ;p
[13:14:18] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, Velveeta  : http://jsfiddle.net/M6cwF/
[13:14:20] <Z3R0> I tried to changing to accept, but the draggable dies
[13:14:34] <Velveeta> yeah same here just now, it's not passing the ui object to that
[13:14:43] <Quest> Velveeta,  not working http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/52/
[13:15:27] <shoky> what's the problem.. if you don't append it to the new one, it will revert, no?
[13:15:36] <shoky> why do you need to do anything special?
[13:15:51] <Z3R0> hey Velveeta: http://jqueryui.com/droppable/#revert
[13:16:10] <Z3R0> change revert to valid...
[13:16:12] <Quest> shoky,  it doesnt.
[13:16:33] <shoky> oh i thought it did before, nevermind
[13:16:47] <Velveeta> quest: http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/53/
[13:16:48] <Quest> Vhttp://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/52/

[13:16:56] * Quest checks
[13:17:02] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/1/ / /there
[13:17:30] <grafi> alerts everywhere
[13:17:31] <grafi> gaaah
[13:17:35] <Velveeta> heheheh
[13:17:48] <Quest> Velveeta,  no. it has a lot of errors / alerts
[13:18:00] <usulix> Z3R0, agreed.. I used true for the boolean... but works for me.
[13:18:04] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: you were overwriting the object you wrote to jrdata[13].data.... http://jsfiddle.net/M6cwF/2/
[13:19:04] <usulix> For the draggable{revert:true} question, are we looking to fire revert after a number of drops of multiple objects?
[13:19:04] <Quest> Z3R0,  nice but i need to drop it IF a certain condition is true
[13:19:15] <Quest> Z3R0,  nice but i need to drop it IF a certain condition is true, Else revert just like you did
[13:19:24] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[13:19:39] <Z3R0> time to fiddle more
[13:20:51] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/SvdGr/2/ // there you go Quest :)
[13:20:52] <usulix> maybe only fire alerts / methods before revert if condition?
[13:20:55] <usulix> http://jsfiddle.net/7kcKr/
[13:21:31] <Z3R0> just overwrite the draggable options
[13:21:40] <Z3R0> I'm sure there is a better way of changing that option
[13:22:01] <Velveeta> krambiorix: you're resetting the data[id] value to an empty object and wiping out your own 0 index
[13:22:25] <Velveeta> you create the 0 key, assign a value to it, then say .data[id] = {} and wipe it out
[13:22:31] <Velveeta> then create your 1 key and delete it
[13:22:50] <maZtah> how to fix two header rows and one left column with this? http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/extras/FixedHeader/
[13:23:00] <maZtah> it should be possible......
[13:23:09] <Velveeta> damnit, noiseeee beat me to it :D
[13:23:36] <NoiseEee> well he only believes in you Velveeta, so joint effort
[13:24:14] <Quest> Z3R0,  nice , but if you see/observe the alerts by just dragging the task multiple times between the two boxes.   the initial parent and target parent gets mixed up.
[13:24:16] <shoky> Z3R0: yeah, using the 'option' method
[13:24:16] <Velveeta> lol
[13:24:26] <Velveeta> noiseeee: you can just latch your product onto my brand name
[13:24:29] <Quest> Z3R0,  cant trace the bug in it though
[13:24:53] <Velveeta> maztah: Syntax error: Please rephrase your question in the form of an actual question.
[13:25:08] <Quest> Z3R0,  try moving from b2 to b1 .   it alerts         b1,b1,t1
[13:25:29] <maZtah> Velveeta: i have this table where i want to "fix" (lock) the 2 top rows, and one most left column
[13:26:46] <Quest> do I make sense?
[13:27:34] <Velveeta> maztah: so that thing is using fixed positioning to make the header row stay in place, it should work the same for 2 rows
[13:27:47] <Quest> Z3R0,  you there? got to leave
[13:27:52] <maZtah> yeah
[13:27:53] <Velveeta> but i'm not sure if it's gonna quite the same as expected for the left column or not
[13:28:13] <maZtah> i'm reading that it is possible, but i just can't figure out how
[13:28:33] <Quest> Z3R0,  Velveeta  shoky  thanks guys
[13:28:39] * Quest leaves to come back
[13:29:38] <Velveeta> not sure, i've never used that before, we have an in-house grid widget we wrote ourselves to support frozen columns, but it uses nested tables
[13:32:10] <shoky> Quest: http://jsfiddle.net/4bmT9/54/
[13:34:04] <shoky> or at least that's what i thought you wanted before, now i'm not sure
[13:37:44] <unnu> Sup #jquery
[13:37:52] <Whirl3d> shoky!   Hey man., I may have something for you!
[13:38:44] <shoky> hey dood. what you up to?
[13:40:35] <unnu> can I set up something in javascript to ehrmm . . .  "Listen" and wait for something from the server like a scoket?
[13:40:51] <unnu> or would it be easier to just hit the server with a request every so often?
[13:43:29] <unnu> no takers? lol
[13:56:47] <BillCriswell> unnu: sockets.io was kind of fun
[14:02:24] <frothnicator> Question: how can I get the coordinates of the mouse at an arbitrary time?  For example, suppose the user hits a button (say 'Shift').  (in other words, a keyboard event, not a mouse event, is fired off).
[14:02:40] <frothnicator> Google suggests that shy of keeping track of where the mouse is at all times, this is not directly possible.  Is my Google Fu on target?
[14:03:08] <ryanneufeld> frothnicator: pretty much yup
[14:04:06] <frothnicator> ryanneufeld: darn.  thanks.
[14:04:31] <tables> how can i set up a 'load more' type thing for messages?
[14:04:34] <tables> like twitter, facebook
[14:04:53] <ryanneufeld> tables: that's a pretty big question
[14:05:09] <ryanneufeld> you'd need to use ajax to request more content from the server, and the add it to the page
[14:05:37] <tables> is there any code out there that already does this?
[14:07:33] <Patrycjusz> Hi All. Im looking for jquery plugin that will help me to make little animation. For example few little bees flying over flower. I want them constatly changing positions in many dirrections. I saw this example one day but i didn't save a link. Please help. Also i'm not a pro.
[14:08:11] <Patrycjusz> i want to make a bubbles coming out from a bootle
[14:08:23] <usulix> table: isotope.js has integration with infniite scroll that does this fairly well
[14:08:26] <usulix> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/infinite-scroll.html
[14:09:50] <usulix> caveat -- it is not a real ajax based load... you set up pages with your sequential content and it loads the section from -- say page2.html into the container on page.html
[14:10:24] <usulix> works pretty well with Wordpress, though.. whatcha wanting to load from?
[14:12:01] <usulix> Patrycjusz, I'd say look into easel.js -- http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS
[14:16:40] <Patrycjusz> usulix: thanks ill try play with this
[14:21:40] <tables> how do i load the page and make it query a server and load messages to my div?   i need an example
[14:29:57] <scipy53> How does the delay function work exactly? I just want to make sure using a lot of delay calls wont slow down my website for some reason.
[14:30:12] <scipy53> Work as in, work in the backend.
[14:32:50] <petey> I'm looking to create a mouseover, would I go with .on('mouseover', function() { }) or do I want to use .mouseover(function(){})
[14:39:57] <DeafGoose> Hi all, anybody familiar with this pluign? http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/
[14:40:29] <shoky> petey: the latter is just a shortcut for the former
[14:41:57] <shoky> scipy53: it delays the next queued animation/function. using setTimeout
[14:42:49] <scipy53> shoky, So until the delayed animation occurs, I can't run any jquery animations in that time interval?
[14:43:33] <shoky> scipy53: you can. first of all the queue is per-element, so you can animate other elements without hassle,
[14:43:52] <shoky> scipy53: but you can also specify which queue the animation will be queued on, in .animate()'s options
[14:44:01] <shoky> or you can do  queue: false
[14:44:09] <shoky> to run the animation immediately
[14:44:16] <scipy53> shoky, Ah I see! Perfect. I jsust want to make sure using too many delays would cause the page to slow down for some reason.
[14:44:20] <shoky> the default queue is 'fx'
[14:44:22] <raj> shoky, this place has been a desert without you
[14:44:26] <raj> ironically
[14:44:35] <shoky> ;p
[14:44:37] <shoky> sup raj
[14:44:48] <scipy53> thanks very much shoky
[14:44:52] <raj> nm, just doing some hacking
[14:45:17] <shoky> proveeeee it
[14:45:46] <raj> you're gonna wish you never said that :)
[14:45:57] <shoky> lawl
[14:55:53] <raj> is there something better than `!$.isEmptyObject(myobj)`?
[14:59:23] <petey> thanks shoky
[14:59:25] <scipy53> shoky, Is there any way to clear the queue for an element to run an animation before the delay its waiting for completes?
[15:00:38] <krambiorix> how can i get the first or third table in a div?
[15:00:45] <krambiorix> or = AND
[15:02:05] <scipy53> shoky, Never mind, I got it by using clearQueue
[15:02:31] <shoky> scipy53: also check out .stop(true)
[15:02:43] <scipy53> ok, thanks!
[15:05:54] <scipy53> shoky, Great, used it instead. Not sure how it differs, but both work :)
[15:20:42] <andrew2123> Do you guys mainly have clients that you have a longterm relationship with or clients that you do one time work for?
[15:27:20] <coldhead> andrew2123: both
[15:28:00] <coldhead> the latter can graduate to the former if i like them
[15:39:16] <ahhughes> anyone prepared to recommend anything for toast?
[15:39:45] <tw2113> toaster, butter, cinnemon sugar ahhughes
[15:39:53] <tw2113> peanut butter if you're fancy
[15:41:51] <headlesslynx> Hello. I'm looking for a specific UI element (I'm trying to find an implementation of it, or write one myself). A reasonable keyword I found for it is "tutorial box"
[15:42:19] <headlesslynx> obviously, it's not very good keyword, so I'll try to describe it.
[15:43:04] <dharmaturtle> I think this is simple, but I'm a jquery noob. Why doesn't my HTML get replaced or my button work? http://jsfiddle.net/VtR7e/6/
[15:43:33] <headlesslynx> you have a webpage. Maybe it's an intranet app, maybe it's something like facebook. I want to do something that works like the noobie tutorials in most games and some sites. Dim/make the screen go modal, except one element. Near that element, pop up a div with an arrow next to the original element
[15:44:43] <headlesslynx> For example, dim the display, leave the "Your username" div area in the top bar still lit; then, pop up a div in the best possible place near that div (most likely, below and to the left), and write some stuff in that div, for example "Click here to change your settings, or log off"
[15:46:54] <tw2113> dharmaturtle, try  $("#TimeLabel").html("Sample text");
[15:47:11] <headlesslynx> tw2113: editing your fiddle.
[15:47:20] <tw2113> not my fiddle
[15:47:35] <headlesslynx> assigning events is done like .click(function() {requestTime()}), not the way you did it. It's weird, but that's the way it works.
[15:47:52] <headlesslynx> also, you must use jquery methods if you use the $ selector, not the usual javascript methods
[15:48:14] <headlesslynx> so, as tw2113 says, you need to use $().html("something") instead of $().innerHtml
[15:49:14] <dharmaturtle> oh, okay >_< thanks all. Turns out I've no idea what I'm doing.
[15:50:47] <usulix> headlesslynx: completely off jQuery topic wise, but you might look at the functionality of http://foundation.zurb.com/files/zurb-joyride-2/demo/demo.html
[15:51:18] <headlesslynx> usulix: myeah, but I thought this is something complex enough not to do with js, but probably nice to do with jquery, and likely implemented in jqueryui
[15:52:23] <usulix> That one is not stictly a jQuery plugin... standalone library associated with the foundation framework if I remember correctly
[15:52:44] <headlesslynx> dharmaturtle: http://jsfiddle.net/VtR7e/9/
[15:53:28] <headlesslynx> you want $(window).load because that fires when everything (all related JSP files, CSS, etc have downloaded)
[15:54:10] <headlesslynx> you use click() instead of onclick(). again, jsquery conventions over javascript, when using the jsquery selector (anything that starts with $(), or as you might later see, $somethingElse)
[15:54:17] <usulix> my bad .. it is jQuery based
[15:54:17] <dharmaturtle> Oh cool, thanks headlesslynx! Small question though, I'm getting "Object [object Object] has no method 'onclick"?
[15:54:30] <dharmaturtle> when I click Refresh
[15:54:38] <coldhead> headlesslynx: something like http://dev7studios.com/demo/jquery-spotlight/ with a tooltip plugin?
[15:55:35] <headlesslynx> coldhead, oh, neat.
[15:55:44] <headlesslynx> I think I can combine that with usulix's answer.
[15:55:56] <headlesslynx> wirting a custom implementation could be fun too.
[15:56:16] <headlesslynx> dharmaturtle: uhm.. there shouldn't be an onclick in my fiddle
[15:57:01] <headlesslynx> dharmaturtle: whoops, my bad. http://jsfiddle.net/VtR7e/10/
[15:57:02] <dharmaturtle> just changed it to click, all's good. Thanks very much for the edit!
[15:57:11] <dharmaturtle> hehe thanks :)
[15:57:38] <headlesslynx> yeah, sorry, I went through it line by line, since I'm not sure on all the syntax myself either :)
[16:12:04] <coldhead> "stronger visual chunking"
[16:25:52] <Whirl3d> you rang?
[17:55:30] <aboudreault> emm, I'm trying to open the input file dialog when the user click on on another element. The element is the input wrapper. Is there anything wrong with that? currently I'm getting: Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[17:57:10] <aboudreault> this is what I do:   mask.on('click', function (e) {input.click(); });
[18:00:03] <shoky> aboudreault: calling .click() triggers a 'click' event, which is calling your event handler again
[18:00:13] <shoky> or so it seems
[18:00:34] <aboudreault> yeah, that's what I see. it...... so I should probably check who did the click event?
[18:00:59] <shoky> aboudreault: also iirc you can't trigger a click on a file input yourself, at least not in a cross-browser way
[18:01:17] <shoky> aboudreault: i don't know what you're doing exactly, so i can't say
[18:01:22] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[18:02:13] <aboudreault> didn't know the input.click() was not cross browser
[18:02:33] <shoky> i don't know what "input" is
[18:02:47] <aboudreault> file input I mean
[18:02:55] <shoky> i'll only know if i see your code
[18:04:32] <aboudreault> you said it just before, not talking about my issue.
[18:04:59] <aboudreault> i fixed my issue
[18:05:05] <aboudreault> by checking the event target.
[18:07:54] <shoky> aboudreault: guess i was wrong, it's possible cross-browser if the file input isn't hidden
[18:08:19] <aboudreault> ok
[18:08:53] <shoky> might not work on opera and safari actually
[18:26:42] <hugo_moss> i'm doing an ajax request, and retrieving a dom element with nestings, and will replace the current page with this element. the pages are identical just with different data. what is the fastest way of doing this with jquery?
[18:29:40] <hugo_moss> replacewith?
[18:34:44] <relipse> how do i find all divs who have an element with text value of x?
[18:35:05] <relipse> <div class="findme"><span>X</span></div>
[18:35:53] <shoky> `api :contains
[18:35:53] <b-ot> shoky: :contains() Selector: Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[18:37:22] <shoky> ?attr
[18:37:22] <b-ot> shoky: used for setting attributes on the HTML tag
[18:37:34] <shoky> ?triggerHandler
[18:43:23] <relipse> thanks shoky
[18:43:38] <relipse> anyone know how in html5 preferably to drag and drop select box items?
[18:43:51] <relipse> i dont want to sort them, i just want to drag an item somewhere else
[19:21:13] <BAMbanda> If a jquery src is directed towards https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[19:21:28] <BAMbanda> does that mean all functionality will stop if those servers are down?
[19:21:48] <BAMbanda> atleast, the code of whatever web app you are creating that uses jquery selectors?
[19:30:50] <hugo_moss> im trying to use an ajax request that returns an html5 document but it seems that it chokes on the html5 doctype?
[20:05:18] <Neo__> Hola
[20:12:07] <Tingle2> Is it somehow possible to prematurly force a ajax response before the whole php script is complete? Ive tried php's flush() but that doesnt seem to work.
[20:23:31] <eip56> Hello everyone. Im having an issue with google maps. Anyone ever ran into ReferenceError: GMap2 is not defined google maps
[20:26:02] <coldhead> this is #jQuery, not #googlemaps
[20:28:39] <jayar> can i ask a question about $('#contact').ajaxForm( {
[20:28:49] <jayar> or do i need to find an ajax channel?
[20:29:32] <coldhead> no that's okay jayar, that's jQuery related
[20:29:40] <coldhead> you can ask any damn question you like here
[20:29:44] <jayar> sweetsauce
[20:29:53] <coldhead> you just might not get answers
[20:30:05] <coldhead> no one ever answers my questions about how to get girls to like me
[20:30:09] <coldhead> but it doesn't stop me
[20:30:48] <jayar> ok, well i got it workin where it posts contact info to the database via submit.php, and then in that php it sends "Thank you!" to the page via target: '#thanks', on the next line
[20:31:21] <jayar> but what if i echo'd data, would it send formatted echo data to any #target i designate?
[20:31:50] <jayar> basically i want a drop down list <select> to pull stuff to the page without resetting the page.
[20:32:04] <coldhead> right
[20:32:13] <coldhead> so you can either have PHP generate that HTML for you
[20:32:21] <coldhead> and jQuery will dump it wherever you tell it to
[20:32:28] <jayar> oh that is so sexy
[20:32:43] <coldhead> or you can just send back the raw data and write something to have jquery turn it into a select
[20:32:49] <coldhead> which is probably more trouble
[20:33:32] <jayar> well the select pulls data to fill the select <option>'s when the page loads, i just need it to pull the data based on whats selected
[20:34:00] <coldhead> sounds like PHP's problem
[20:34:09] <jayar> but if i can fill that target with whatever i put in php, i'm golden
[20:34:15] <jayar> cuz the php already works great
[20:34:15] <coldhead> so golden
[20:34:23] <coldhead> i can hardly bear to look at you
[20:34:27] <coldhead> all gleamy and golden
[20:34:30] <jayar> the shine
[20:34:35] <jayar> the sparkle
[20:34:47] <jayar> gleaming...
[20:34:50] <coldhead> the lustre
[20:35:19] <jayar> the synonyms just pour out of the light... blindingly...
[20:46:08] <jayar> k, it also has a 'success: function() { }' where i can have it do somethin after, can i move that before the 'target: '#stuff', so that i can make it slideDown() before it fills that area with data?
[20:46:25] <jayar> or does the success have to happen at the end?
[20:51:51] <jayar> okay. it works with a submit button, but not with onchange="this.form.submit();" :(
[20:58:11] <ahhughes> can anyone give me some advice... I need a toggle button... or really whatever fakes such a thing
[20:58:18] <jayar> toggle()
[21:00:59] <coldhead> ahhughes: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/309081/how-do-you-create-a-toggle-button
[21:01:06] <coldhead> don't thank me, thank google
[21:03:53] <ahhughes> .toggleClass("theName") will do nicely, thanks coldhead
[21:04:23] <jayar> coldhead: got it workin, thanks to your stellar pants... but now i gotta resize the .panel after the data is injected...
[21:05:45] <coldhead> jayar: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/#options-object
[21:05:54] <coldhead> you want to provide a "success" callback function
[21:06:04] <coldhead> to run when the ajax request is done
[21:07:30] <jayar> yea i got that, but success: function() { $('#sample').slideDown(); } didnt work... im lookin into .height or somethin...
[21:09:15] <jayar> i need the div to grow to the size of the new content
[21:11:00] <jayar> .height(but where do i get a new height value... hmmm... googles not helpin... i thought maybe the css wouldnt let it overflow, but it did
[21:11:07] <coldhead> that really sounds like you should be using CSS with height:auto
[21:11:22] <coldhead> or something
[21:11:29] <coldhead> make it the browsers problem
[21:12:40] <jayar> yea, maybe i can .animate the css height to somethin i know will be bigger than any of the content.
[21:12:56] <jayar> height:auto didnt work either.
[21:14:38] <jayar> or i can grab the height of the new div, then stretch it to that height...
[21:14:49] <coldhead> it will work if you have the CSS set up nicely in the first place
[21:14:57] <coldhead> but it depends what you have going on
[21:15:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: what up :) ?
[21:21:37] <jayar> got it
[21:21:38] <jayar> var $ht = $('#sample'); $('#main').animate({ height: $ht.height()+300 });
[21:21:50] <jayar> thanx for yer help man :)
[21:21:53] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am trying to find out how to get the alert to only fire when the proper link is clicked with the parent element having the class "end", any suggestions? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gnuBG
[21:38:28] <d3m0n> Any suggestions?
[21:54:14] <d3m0n> Am I crazy or something http://codepen.io/anon/pen/gnuBG why wouldnt this work?
[22:03:50] <jayar> how do i do this.addClass()
[22:03:56] <jayar> is it $('this').
[22:03:59] <jayar> or $this...
[22:05:50] <sacho> jayar, do you recognize what $ is?
[22:08:19] <jayar> no
[22:08:32] <jayar> <-- rookie
[22:13:43] <sacho> $ is a function
[22:14:06] <sacho> if you pass a string as the first parameter, jquery uses it as a selector to select items
[22:14:12] <sacho> so what would $('this') do, then?
[22:14:32] <sacho> $this is just an identifier. Unless you defined it yourself, it wouldn't exist.
[22:15:07] <sacho> What you're looking for is $(this) -> if you pass a DOM element to the $ function, then it will wrap it in a jquery collection.
[22:15:34] <sacho> and jquery collections have all those methods, e.g. "animate" "addClass"
[22:19:51] <b0nn> Hm, this http://pastebin.com/eHYJkZ4p gives me a 400 error, and I cannot see why
[22:21:04] <sacho> well, what's the 400 error?
[22:21:41] <b0nn> 127.0.0.1 - - [08/Nov/2013:19:21:29 +1300] "POST /tomcat/CelestialCalculations/archiveMonthly.html HTTP/1.1" 400 1146 "http://shanehowearth.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0"
[22:22:22] <sacho> That's still only the status code.
[22:22:34] <sacho> Why don't you check in your developer tools what the actual response is?
[22:23:14] <b0nn> hm
[22:23:19] <b0nn> firefox?
[22:23:31] <b0nn> because I thought I was doing that and I didn't see anything
[22:24:06] <b0nn> All I get is description The request sent by the client was syntactically incorrect ().
[22:25:50] <sacho> well, then your request isn't syntactically correct
[22:25:55] <b0nn> heh
[22:26:06] <b0nn> does this help? http://pastebin.com/SJFyXiNd
[22:27:16] <sacho> well, uh
[22:28:17] <b0nn> heh, I'm lost with troubleshooting it. If I knew how to get it to tell me what its problem is, well, I could fix it then
[22:28:49] <sacho> does the server actually expect json?
[22:29:31] <b0nn> no, I just put it in after reading that the data might be malformed and stringify was the fix
[22:29:41] <sacho> you're sending json
[22:30:01] <sacho> try removing the content-type and simply send your data as a plain object(jquery will urlencode it)
[22:30:30] <sacho> really, you need to ask what the server accepts, then simply send whatever
[22:31:31] <b0nn> yeah, well, yeah, that's what I had originally, and was getting the error from
[22:32:04] <b-lew> is it possible to check the value of a select box and add that value to the body class then change it based off of the select box?
[22:32:27] <b0nn> sacho: http://shanehowearth.com
[22:32:44] <b0nn> I removed the JSON stuff, and it killed all of my script :\
[22:33:13] <b-lew> I am currently using this code but it doesn't see the current item on init
[22:33:38] <relipse> in a function inside a JSON object, does "this" refer to the current object?
[22:34:12] <jalcine> relipse: no, the calling method's 'this'
[22:34:15] <jalcine> and hello again
[22:34:18] <jalcine> lol
[22:34:55] <relipse> hello?
[22:35:09] <jalcine> from #html5
[22:35:41] <sacho> say what?
[22:36:00] <sacho> relipse, if you call a function like this-> obj.function(), then `this`, unless bound, will refer to `obj`
[22:36:04] <relipse> actually it does work
[22:36:17] <relipse> i just fiddled it
[22:36:24] <coldhead> god i have missed you relipse
[22:36:43] <relipse> http://jsfiddle.net/DkLWm/
[22:36:53] <relipse> why is that coldhead
[22:38:04] <coldhead> i don't know, relipse
[22:38:36] <coldhead> it's a fool that looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart
[22:40:05] <relipse> i need Jesus
[22:40:38] <b0nn> Ok, this is my entire .js http://pastebin.com/WwxNRJ5v the $(document).ready works fine, but the archiveFetch gives me a 400 and I don't understand why
[22:43:55] <spygame> hey guys, is there any way i can disable certain dates in jquery ui datepicker ?
[22:45:33] <coldhead> yes, yes there is
[22:46:07] <b0nn> is my problem that easy to fix?
[22:46:35] <sacho> ask whoever is writing the backend what he accepts as data.
[22:53:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0nn: looking at it
[22:53:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> b0nn: btw you can use $.post instead of $.ajax
[22:54:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> and what did you mean by 400?
[22:54:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> sancho: lol these days the lines between front end and backend are quickly blurring
[22:54:59] <sacho> that's nice.
[22:55:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> im guessing your busy
[22:56:17] <coldhead> lol sancho
[22:57:31] <b0nn> Rohan_Bhangui: The 400 I get back is http://pastebin.com/SJFyXiNd
[22:57:49] <b0nn> sacho: I write the backend..
[22:58:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> again as sacho stated check what is acceptable data
[22:58:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the backend
[22:59:06] <sacho> b0nn, well, what do you expect as data?
[22:59:38] <b0nn> backend: http://pastebin.com/GAQPfZ4q
[23:03:14] <sacho> that doesnt really mean anything to me
[23:03:34] <b0nn> heh, I pasted it because that's the only way I can answer your question
[23:03:47] <sacho> perhaps you should be sending your request to /archiveMonthly, not to /whateveritwas.html
[23:04:47] <b0nn> I think I'm sending it to the right place, else I'd get a mapping error, or a 500 error
[23:05:33] <jayar> accordion() is built into jquery or is it a plugin/widget?
[23:06:05] <b0nn> jqury-ui
[23:36:00] <SuperTyp> hello
[23:36:40] <SuperTyp> is there a good plugin for making the screen "jump" if you reached the bottom of the page
[23:36:51] <SuperTyp> like the animation of the iphone e.g.
[23:42:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> jump?
[23:43:12] <Cork> i guess he means like http://davidwalsh.name/demo/iscroll/examples/pull-to-refresh/
[23:51:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: on an unrelated topic
[23:51:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> which is better
[23:51:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> using img
[23:51:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> or converting image to base64
[23:51:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and to begin with what is base 64 vs image
[23:51:45] <epichero> Context is your friend
[23:51:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> just asking in genereal
[23:52:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> esp. for like background  images in style sheets
[23:52:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> where its mostly used
[23:52:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> where i have seen it mostly used
[23:52:26] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: base64 saves a network connection, but the data becomes bigger
[23:52:40] <Cork> so base64 is useful for small images, but not large ones
[23:52:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[23:52:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> makes sense
[23:52:54] <Cork> base64 is an encoding form
[23:53:14] <Cork> it means you take the raw data of the content and base64 encode it so it doesn't affect proxies and the like
[23:53:21] <Cork> ?g wiki base64
[23:53:21] <b-ot> Cork: Base64 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64
[23:56:40] <Lann> Is it ok to ask a backbone/requrie.js conceptual question here?
