[00:00:22] <Whirl3d_> I need to be able to  take a scrolling div and have it snap to the top of the element with the greatest percentage visible when the scrolling stops.
[00:05:03] <doug65536> neworder: on second look, what these guys do is make one crazy table then selectively add/remove display: none
[00:05:19] <doug65536> neworder: (tablenation)
[00:05:24] <doug65536> tablet*
[00:05:31] <neworder> hmm
[00:06:02] <neworder> I see. I expected the loading time to be slow but it wasn't very bad
[00:06:16] <neworder> Maybe there's no need for AJAX =)
[00:10:12] <doug65536> neworder: they call alert... bad
[00:10:31] <neworder> haha
[00:10:33] <neworder> yeah
[00:10:37] <neworder> why is it considered bad?
[00:11:04] <doug65536> modal dialogs that block you until you click ok?
[00:11:12] <neworder> haha
[00:11:15] <neworder> I see
[00:11:15] <doug65536> could have shown the user better
[00:11:47] <doug65536> I don't even use alert in fiddles lol
[00:12:52] <doug65536> $('#log').append($('<div>').text(msg));   FTW
[00:13:11] <doug65536> s/<div>/<p>/
[00:18:23] <Whirl3d_> http://jsbin.com/AnURiCU/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[00:22:52] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: error on line 6
[00:22:57] <doug65536> wherever that is
[00:23:35] <Whirl3d_> dont' see that
[00:23:41] <doug65536> open console
[00:23:46] <doug65536> then run
[00:24:01] <Whirl3d_> yup. No errors here
[00:24:09] <doug65536> "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined (line 6)"
[00:24:26] <doug65536> run then click it
[00:24:30] <Whirl3d_> doug65536, that's the problem I am having....it scrolls to the bottom
[00:25:03] <doug65536> ah you want to implement something like detents
[00:25:03] <Whirl3d_> when I stop scrolling, I divide the scroll top by the window height  and round down
[00:25:20] <doug65536> you know what a detent is right?
[00:25:27] <Whirl3d_> not
[00:25:59] <doug65536> it's like a mousewheel, where it wants to spring back but once you go past a certain point, it wants to go forward, into a natural position
[00:26:09] <doug65536> like the gear shift of an automatic transmission
[00:26:26] <doug65536> or a knob with 4 positions
[00:26:41] <doug65536> it wants to go back but past a certain point it wants to go to next position
[00:26:55] <Whirl3d_> that's one way of looking at it. I've always heard it called "snapping"
[00:27:01] <Whirl3d_> snapping to something
[00:27:14] <doug65536> snapping means when they get close, make it stick to it
[00:27:25] <doug65536> similar meaning yes
[00:27:36] <Whirl3d_> in this case , when you stop scrolling, it snaps to the nearest section
[00:27:48] <Whirl3d_> I see how detents makes sense too.
[00:28:53] <doug65536> is this what you had in mind when you started the scroll event thing?
[00:29:15] <Whirl3d_> So I figure that if I take the scrollTop divided by the window height and round down that will give me the index of one of the two elements that are partially visible on the screen.
[00:29:15] <doug65536> when the user stops, snap to nearest thing?
[00:29:25] <Whirl3d_> THis is a side effect of the scroll event thing
[00:29:59] <Whirl3d_> each element is sized to be 100% of the window height
[00:30:01] <doug65536> take floor and ceil of the divide, then whichever has lowest absolute difference is closest
[00:30:28] <doug65536> "difference" is "difference between calculated position and top of screen"
[00:32:34] <Whirl3d_> var pos=scrollTop/winh; var indx=Math.min(pos-Math.floor(pos), pos-Math.ceil(pos));
[00:32:48] <Whirl3d_> no...
[00:34:27] <Whirl3d_> if (Math.ceil(pos)-pos)>pos-Math.floor(pos)) {indx=Math.ceil(pos);} else {indx=Math.floor(pos);}
[00:40:41] <Whirl3d_> http://jsbin.com/AnURiCU/2/
[00:40:42] <doug65536> how are you determining which ones are onscreen? scrolltop?
[00:40:48] <Whirl3d_> Closer
[00:41:00] <Whirl3d_> scrollTop/winh
[00:41:31] <doug65536> then search for first positive one and then use highest negative one and first positive one?
[00:42:30] <Whirl3d_> Math.floor(scrollTop/winh) gives you the index of the first visible one
[00:43:57] <doug65536> scrolltop of the container ok
[00:44:02] <Whirl3d_> var btm=list.eq(ndx).position().top+winh;   diff=btm-scrollTop; if (diff/winh>0.5) {this is the current one)
[00:44:08] <doug65536> yes, I forgot they are all the same size
[00:44:19] <Whirl3d_> makes it easier
[00:44:21] <doug65536> if you get scrollTop of the child, it tells you where it is relative to the viewport
[00:44:40] <Whirl3d_> huh?
[00:45:14] <doug65536> say you had element X inside the overflow: scroll div... then if you get scrollTop of X it will be negative if it is scrolled off the top of the viewport
[00:45:25] <Whirl3d_> duh, that akes sense doesn't it. Never though of it like that
[00:45:55] <doug65536> but you have right idea if you read scrollTop off the div itself
[00:46:20] <doug65536> trust me, trying to deal with those crazy viewport relative offsets is tricky
[00:53:31] <Dirkos> I have this code: http://jsfiddle.net/V7gzc/ how come that not all rss data is in there?
[00:54:29] <Cork> Dirkos: just guessing, but i suspect they limit the number of records it sends
[00:54:51] <Dirkos> Cork: but check the feed itself? I am missing alot of data
[00:54:57] <Dirkos> http://www.nu.nl/feeds/rss/algemeen.rss
[00:55:12] <Cork> Dirkos: like i said, i suspect they limit the number of records
[00:55:59] <Dirkos> Cork: but whats the diff? With my browser i see everything?
[00:56:35] <Cork> "i think they limit the number" <--
[00:56:48] <Cork> not sure what's not understandable with that...
[00:57:15] <Dirkos> no i dont understand... when requesting something from the browser its ok..... when doing the same from my code its different? Kinda strange not?
[00:57:29] <Cork> cause you use a third party service?
[00:57:41] <Cork> and it might limit the number of records it forwards
[00:58:09] <Whirl3d_> doug65536, finally got it to work. Now I just need to make it nicer...
[00:58:18] <Whirl3d_> http://jsbin.com/AnURiCU/3/edit
[00:58:19] <Dirkos> ok, another question then. Is it possible to get the feed directly with jquery?
[00:58:41] <Whirl3d_> doug65536, thanks for all your help tonight. I'm going to bed...
[00:59:18] <Cork> Dirkos: no
[00:59:32] <Cork> Dirkos: you can only load xml from the same domain as the site it runs on
[01:00:16] <Dirkos> well then i will make a PHP wrapper since i can extract the contents and parse that to xml
[01:00:20] <Dirkos> there is no JS for that?
[01:01:07] <doug65536> Whirl3d_: good night
[01:01:12] <Cork> Dirkos: https://developers.google.com/feed/v1/jsondevguide#optArgs
[01:01:15] <Cork> see num
[01:03:33] <Cork> Dirkos: it isn't a limit in js, it is a block from the browser, if you allow a site to do requests cross domain without any form or control you get ways to push load over to other hosts
[01:03:43] * Successful is now away, auto-away after 20 minutes (log\on pager\on)
[01:03:46] <Cork> Dirkos: so the browser blocks this unless the requesting server allows it
[01:04:02] <Cork> Successful: turn that damn announcer of...
[01:04:02] * Successful is away, auto-away after 20 minutes (18s ago)
[01:04:10] <Cork> *off
[01:04:38] <Dirkos> ok thnx, i will write a php wrapper for it instead and request this
[01:08:01] <Jamal> Hi guys, is there any way to return the string that contains a substring? i.e. if you have the string "i am a string" and i want to return each word that begins with a "s". How would that work? Thanks!
[01:08:49] <doug65536> js> "I am a string".match(/\s(\S)/g)
[01:08:56] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[01:09:03] <doug65536> js> print("I am a string".match(/\s(\S)/g))
[01:09:10] <b-ot> doug65536:  a, a, s
[01:09:53] <doug65536> js> print("I am a string".match(/\(\S)\S*\s+/g))
[01:09:59] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[01:11:29] <frosch> Hi! Do you separate event handler setup code into a seperate domain-events.js file or do you wire up your events in the same file where you define the underlying domain.js functionality?
[01:13:02] <Jamal> doug65536: doesn't seem to work? :/
[01:13:42] <doug65536> js> print("I am a string".match(/\(\S)\S*\s*/g))
[01:13:48] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[01:13:59] <doug65536> js> print("I am a string".match(/(\S)\S*\s*/g))
[01:14:07] <b-ot> doug65536: I ,am ,a ,string
[01:14:21] <doug65536> weird
[01:14:58] <Jamal> :|
[01:15:07] <doug65536> js is ignoring my captures
[01:16:14] <Jamal> hm pretty weird
[01:16:55] <Jamal> i'm trying to get all strings out of a whole string that starts with a '#'. but nothing seems to work
[01:17:26] <doug65536> jamal js regex sucks, no 0-length backreference
[01:17:39] <Dirkos> enclosure 	Object { @attributes={...}} 	
[01:17:52] <Dirkos> how can i read this? enclosure.@attributes wont work
[01:18:30] <Jamal> doug65536: ye seems so. is there any other way to get this?
[01:20:14] <doug65536> a loop, then substr each offset, then regex that to get a word
[01:23:58] <Jamal> okay thanks i'll give it a try
[01:24:34] <Cork> Dirkos: uh... why, like i said, there is an option for how many fields to allow
[01:24:47] <Cork> Dirkos: so if that is the only problem you have, why write a new script?
[01:28:47] <chovy> how come jshint gives me "inefficient jquery usage" warnings when I do $("tbody tr") for example.
[01:29:20] <Cork> chovy: cause you have to search through the dom to select by tag
[01:29:36] <Cork> while class and id is kept in hash tables in the browser
[01:33:44] <Krambiorix> hi, my autocomplete suggestions aren't shown, can someone please take a look? http://pastebin.com/aF6mdsNh
[01:34:11] <anli> Seems like $(window).scroll(function(){}); only trigs the first time I scroll my document, why?
[01:35:12] <Krambiorix> I think my problem is somewhere in .data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = function( ul, item ) { ....
[01:35:34] <Cork> Krambiorix: the response function is expected to be called
[01:35:35] <Cork> not return
[01:40:06] <Krambiorix> Cork, today you're my hero
[01:48:58] <slartsa> Has anyone been scaling divs automatically to fit screen as much as possible? And has that someone also had to scale down those divs if new divs have been added?
[01:49:11] <anli> Why is the scroll event only trigged once in this page: anders.dev.100procent.com
[01:49:52] <anli> you want divs to go side by side?
[01:50:35] <slartsa> I'm having a "chat" where I want divs to scale proportionally as new "chat" windows are created but I have little knowledge on how to control those "chat" windows. There shouldn't be any max amount of windows or it should be big, like at least 16
[01:51:23] <Cork> anli: i get more then one here...
[01:51:28] <Cork> 73 scrolling
[01:51:34] <anli> Cork: hm, ok? :)
[01:51:51] <anli> Cork: Thanks for testing
[01:52:01] <anli> I only get one, maybe I should try different browsers
[01:52:15] <Cork> anli: well i tried ff and chrome
[01:52:25] <anli> yeah, chrome did it well
[01:52:28] <anli> firefox not
[01:52:32] <anli> Maybe its a firebug error
[01:52:42] <anli> doh!
[01:52:46] <anli> It collapses those events
[01:52:53] <anli> I forgot the counter
[01:52:54] <Cork> anli: console.log gets eaten by the built in console sometimes
[01:53:00] <anli> hehe
[01:53:15] <anli> There is only one line, but I can read the number "90" in the end of it
[01:53:23] <anli> Thanks again
[01:53:37] <Cork> slartsa: you could try the flexbox css feature
[01:56:02] <anli> Whats a built in console btw?
[01:56:14] <Cork> ctrl+shift+k
[01:58:37] <majuscule> I have an $.getJSON request that is failing in Chrome but not FF. I've written a `.fail(function(jqxhr, textStatus, error)` function, but the status is simply 'error'. How can I dig deeper into this to figure out what's wrong?
[01:59:04] <Cork> majuscule: check the browsers console
[01:59:16] <Cork> it normally shows an error there or similar
[01:59:47] <majuscule> that's another good point - strange thing is, it's not even showing up under the network tab!
[01:59:56] <majuscule> it's as though in Chrome, the request never even happens
[02:00:21] <Cork> majuscule: cross domain?
[02:00:25] <majuscule> nope
[02:00:33] <Cork> link?
[02:00:45] <majuscule> https://dylansserver.com/mud/index.php
[02:01:04] <majuscule> $.getJSON('/mud/mud.php', { 'cmd' : 'poll' }, function(messages) { console.log(messages) }).fail(function(j,t,e) { console.log(j,t,e) });
[02:03:16] <Cork> majuscule: if you mean line 212 in mud.js
[02:03:21] <Cork> it runs just fine here
[02:03:42] <majuscule> seriously?
[02:03:43] <majuscule> oO
[02:04:07] <majuscule> that is so strange!
[02:04:48] <Cork> chromium 29
[02:04:59] <majuscule> Version 29.0.1547.57 (217859)
[02:05:14] <majuscule> $.getJSON('/mud/mud.php', { 'cmd' : 'poll' }, function(messages) { console.log(messages) }).fail(function(j,t,e) { console.log('fail',j,t,e) });
[02:05:18] <majuscule> Object {readyState: 1, getResponseHeader: function, getAllResponseHeaders: function, setRequestHeader: function, overrideMimeType: functionâ¦}
[02:05:21] <majuscule> fail
[02:05:36] <majuscule> (fuck, sorry, didn't mean to post so much here)
[02:06:20] <Cork> i get the success callback
[02:07:18] <majuscule> that is so bizarre. running a full system upgrade in case its a chrome version problem
[02:07:45] <majuscule> glad to hear it though!
[02:07:56] <Cork> i run the same version
[02:07:57] <majuscule> chromium-29.0.1547.62-1 installing
[02:09:07] <majuscule> any other ideas why it might be failing for me then?
[02:09:46] <Cork> only thing i can think of is a network problem
[02:09:58] <majuscule> works perfectly in ff though :-/
[02:10:01] <majuscule> hrmph.
[02:10:40] <Cork> try if you can reproduce the problem in a minimalistic testcase
[02:10:54] <Cork> where you run as little js as possible
[02:11:46] <majuscule> that's what i was trying by manually running the $.getJSON in console. I suppose i can just skip even loading the rest of the js for the sake of a test case
[02:13:29] <majuscule> yeah even without the rest of mud.js (only loading jquery-core) i get the same fail
[02:13:37] <majuscule> also now on bleeding edge chrome
[02:13:38] <majuscule> freaky
[02:13:53] <majuscule> in the morning when my roommate wakes up i'll have him try it :-)
[02:14:11] <doug65536> wake him up now!
[02:14:23] <majuscule> hahahaha, don't tempt me :D
[02:14:54] <slartsa> Cork: thanks! Will look into it!
[02:14:55] <majuscule> i should go to bed soon anyway, but dreading it, i'd stay awake 24/7 if i could pull it off
[02:15:28] <majuscule> good music and good code to be had
[02:21:46] <Muhyee> hello all
[02:22:05] <mezo> I have this problem I want div to be hidden by default. Which I set by "display: none", when I call fadeOut (even when div is already hidden), jquery removes display none and start animating opacity to 0 and then hid it again -> which makes it visible for split second. Any help?
[02:23:08] <Muhyee> why would you fadeOut what is already hidden?
[02:23:10] <amitprakash> Hi, what would be a good way to append a row to a table via jquery, i was trying $('#tableid tbody tr:last').after(row); however this fails when the table has no rows by default
[02:23:15] <Cork> mezo: you should not hide elements with display: none
[02:23:23] <Cork> mezo: run .hide() on page load instead
[02:23:40] <Cork> amitprakash: .append
[02:23:44] <Cork> to tbody
[02:24:08] <Muhyee> I got a difficult one let me write it down...
[02:24:34] <mezo> Cork, so I cannot hide it before jquery is loaded? Does jquery some how "indexes" hidden divs?
[02:25:01] <Cork> mezo: .hide() stores the old display value
[02:25:12] <Cork> you won't have that if you do display: none
[02:25:19] <Cork> so some animations will break
[02:25:36] <amitprakash> Cork, thanks .. could you please hint on why tr:last doesn't work?
[02:26:05] <Cork> amitprakash: it should work too, just extra work for the browser
[02:26:13] <Muhyee> I have a chat room and when i start and write a name and use tab i want to autocomplete it...I have this problem with .replace() it doesnt always change the username with the last text i written
[02:27:02] <amitprakash> Cork, strangely enough the selector tr:last returns an empty array []
[02:27:16] <Muhyee> if there is for example Mu in text before that it will change that one,how can i make it to replace the last Mu found?
[02:27:19] <Cork> amitprakash: try :last-child
[02:28:26] <amitprakash> still the same thing, either way append does the job
[02:28:57] <Cork> Muhyee: /Mu$/, 'other value' ?
[02:30:25] <Muhyee> But i want it to be a variable and regexp confuses on how to use variable for rule
[02:30:56] <Cork> new RegExp('string' + '$')
[02:31:35] <Cork> js> print("Mu Mu".replace(new RegExp("Mu" + '$'), "Something"))
[02:31:43] <b-ot> Cork: Mu Something
[02:32:22] <Muhyee> i see...well that was just a bug i found out now...here is my real problem :/
[02:33:01] <Muhyee> if the name is autocompleted i want it to be Blue color but in my input form i dont want anything like <span> to be shown
[02:33:29] <Cork> you can't have color in an input field
[02:33:32] <Muhyee> i dont want to replace any usernames by random only those who are autocompleted via tab button to be blue
[02:33:46] <Muhyee> after i hit enter i append it to a div
[02:33:52] <Muhyee> i want to be blue in that div
[02:33:58] <Cork> you could have an inline autocomplete solution where you use text selection though
[02:34:08] <doug65536> by blue you mean selected, right?
[02:34:16] <amitprakash> One other question, a jquery function runs for every div matching selector on $(document).ready, however this will not work for matching divs created via js after page load.. since theres no event to trigger on [ DOM Manipulation not an event? ] how do I ensure the function runs for matching future objects as well?
[02:34:58] <Cork> amitprakash: you can't
[02:35:08] <Cork> amitprakash: you have to manually run them on new elements
[02:35:11] <doug65536> amitprakash: store the selector, then when you use it, do $(stored_selector)
[02:35:43] <Muhyee> let me explain better....its a chat i hit enter i send the message like here
[02:35:43] <amitprakash> Cork, hmm okay.. jquery doesn't have support for mutationobserver + childList?
[02:36:03] <Cork> amitprakash: it does, but mutation observers isn't cross browsers
[02:36:41] <Muhyee> when i type Muhyee without tab my text is black...if i type Mu + Tab button then my input field autocompletes the Muhyee name...and when i send it i want to be shown blue on screen (color:blue)
[02:36:52] <amitprakash> firefox and chrome seem sufficient
[02:38:11] <amitprakash> Cork, could you point to some doc that talks about mutationobserver support in jquery?
[02:38:29] <Cork> amitprakash: what do you mean "in jquery"?
[02:38:49] <Cork> jquery is a framework, you write javascript
[02:39:12] <Cork> ?g mdn mutationobserver
[02:39:13] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[02:39:14] <amitprakash> Ah, I am assuming something simpler than writing an observer, then looking for dom_manipulation, detecting selector and firing the function
[02:39:39] <Cork> amitprakash: well you could write a helper plugin for jquery
[02:39:45] <amitprakash> I guess :)
[02:39:46] <Cork> there might even be one around somewhere
[02:41:22] <amitprakash> gah, i've totally forgotten how these worked, can't even figure out how my old code used it
[02:41:30] * amitprakash reads the MDN docs again
[02:42:06] <Muhyee> any idea how to write that down guys?
[02:45:21] <Cork> Muhyee: if you want to color text differently you have to use dom elements to separate them
[02:47:21] <Muhyee> i know i want to use a span for example...how can i do that without messing with what users sees in his input field?
[02:47:42] <Cork> you can't mess with the input field
[02:47:47] <Cork> you can't have html in the input field
[02:48:38] <Muhyee> but when i submit my form how can i send the html data that i want?
[02:49:03] <Cork> Muhyee: the html data?
[02:49:15] <Cork> if you want to send the input + some extra html tags
[02:49:24] <Cork> use a hidden field and fill it with the resulting html
[02:50:12] <Muhyee> my data will be <span style='color:blue;'>Muhyee</span> for example but in the form only Muhyee will be shown
[02:50:27] <seutje> that's not data
[02:50:40] <seutje> needs key/value, not just a value
[02:50:54] <seutje> which translates to name/value I guess
[02:51:14] <Muhyee> im not sure i follow you!
[02:51:33] <Muhyee> as you have probably guessed im pretty newbie about programming
[02:51:44] <seutje> <input type="hidden" name="someName" value="Muhyee">
[02:51:51] <Cork> Muhyee: input fields is what is submitted, not the html in the form
[02:52:03] <seutje> that will show up in the data as "someName"
[02:52:16] <seutje> like data.someName === 'Muhyee'
[02:53:22] <Muhyee> in that case i want my value to be a span with color blue
[02:53:48] <Cork> Muhyee: so create a hidden field and make the data you want
[02:53:57] <Muhyee> BUT i dont want to be blue every username in my text only those who are autocompleted with tab button thats my problem
[02:53:58] <Cork> and when the user updates it's visible field, update the hidden one
[02:54:36] <blahlbaglblah> hello
[02:54:42] <Muhyee> hey
[02:55:55] <blahlbaglblah> Ajax website. How to make the transition animation page? Sorry for the stupid question
[02:56:51] <amitprakash> Muhyee, what you should use is a span on clicking which is replaced with the hidden input containing the value
[02:56:52] <Cork> blahlbaglblah: you would have to add the new content hidden
[02:57:04] <Cork> blahlbaglblah: and then transition from one to the other
[02:58:03] <blahlbaglblah> Cork Thank you
[02:58:03] <ohcibi> how to add objects to the window object of an iframe?
[02:58:29] <seutje> iframeReference.windowElement.foo = 'bar';?
[02:58:33] <seutje> ?mdn windowelement
[02:58:33] <b-ot> seutje: Window - Web API reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window
[02:58:36] <seutje> nope
[02:58:49] <ohcibi> seutje: i did that i get undefined reference for foo... i'll try a fiddle
[02:58:57] <seutje> contentwindow!
[02:59:01] <seutje> ?mdn contentwindow
[02:59:01] <b-ot> seutje: contentWindow - XUL | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL/Property/contentWindow
[02:59:27] <Cork> ohcibi: if is the iframe is from the same domain then ya contentWindow
[02:59:48] <Cork> you're out of luck if it isn't
[02:59:48] <ohcibi> uhm no... the domain will be different...
[02:59:53] <seutje> oh
[02:59:54] <seutje> lol
[03:00:02] <Krambiorix> i want to add a click event on my autocomplete items (the "select" options in autocomplete doesn't work) ... http://pastebin.com/cBKJmV3A  But the alert is never shown....
[03:00:05] <seutje> do you control both sides?
[03:00:09] <ohcibi> yes
[03:00:20] <Cork> ohcibi: then you have to proxy it over the server
[03:00:32] <seutje> is the title way still the best we have to offer?
[03:00:44] <Muhyee> @amitprakash thats what im trying to do but without success
[03:00:50] <ohcibi> Cork: how do you mean?
[03:00:58] <seutje> or with the hash in the iframe's src or something, it's hacky...
[03:01:17] <Cork> ohcibi: you would have to send data to the server, and the iframe would have to poll if from there
[03:01:32] <seutje> that's the least hacky way :P
[03:01:33] <ohcibi> hm... i'll guess window.parent inside the iframe is also an option?
[03:01:41] <seutje> not xdomain
[03:01:46] <Cork> no it will be a security block
[03:01:56] <ohcibi> hm.... i'm able to control the browser
[03:02:01] <ohcibi> its a webview inside an android app
[03:02:18] <ohcibi> so I could disable cross-domain check, no?
[03:02:18] <Cork> ohcibi: ah, then you might have some control of the xss blockage
[03:02:26] <seutje> not sure if that changes anything
[03:02:32] <Cork> ohcibi: possibly, but not recommended
[03:03:04] <Cork> ohcibi: xss can leak data quite badly
[03:03:18] <ohcibi> i'm just realizing that what we are trying to do is actually exactly what an attacker would do 8-))
[03:03:34] <Cork> ohcibi: one of them ya
[03:03:39] <seutje> there's reasons these things are considered security violations :P
[03:03:47] <ohcibi> 8)
[03:06:36] <amitprakash> Muhyee, see this http://jsfiddle.net/rJpqG/1/
[03:14:18] <amitprakash> when I do a $(selector).append('somehtml'); how do I get the element that has just been added? would it be returned by the append function/
[03:14:28] <Krambiorix> how can i transform this to $(this) ?
[03:14:45] <Cork> amitprakash: by parsing the html separately and then appending them
[03:14:57] <amitprakash> Krambiorix, this is javascript element, $(this) is a jquery selector
[03:15:01] <amitprakash> this is immutable
[03:15:18] <Cork> amitprakash: var newElements = $('somehtml'); $(selector).append(newElements);
[03:15:30] <amitprakash> Cork, thank you
[03:15:41] <Cork> and no $(this) isn't a selector
[03:15:52] <amitprakash> it isn't?
[03:15:56] <Cork> $() is a initialiation call to jquery
[03:16:02] <Cork> it can take a dom element
[03:16:05] <amitprakash> ah ok
[03:16:07] <Cork> (this normally is)
[03:16:28] <amitprakash> I assumed a dom element counts as a selector :)
[03:16:41] <Cork> so $(this) is a call to jquery to create a new jquery object with this as the member
[03:16:52] <Cork> no
[03:17:11] <Cork> jquery holds the dom elements in an array like object
[03:17:17] <Cork> $(this)[0] === this
[03:17:23] <amitprakash> oh
[03:17:57] <Cork> if you pass it a string it will use sizzle to try to find the dom elements it matches
[03:18:04] <Cork> and those dom elements will be in the array
[03:18:15] <Cork> ?g sizzle
[03:18:16] <b-ot> Cork: Sizzle JavaScript Selector Library → http://sizzlejs.com/
[03:18:27] <grafi> man, sizzle is such a cool name
[03:18:38] <grafi> :P
[03:18:41] <amitprakash> So if given a selector, jquery stores the dom element in an array, how does jquery figure out which functions are available to the resulting object? i.e. why might $(this) support val() but $('.generic-class') won't?
[03:20:14] <amitprakash> nm, seems like $('.generic-class') also supports val(), just the value is ''
[03:20:56] <Cork> depends on what .generic-class matches :)
[03:21:04] <amitprakash> right
[03:22:05] <amitprakash> $('div').html('Hello') breaks stuff :D
[03:22:12] <sl33k> anyone reshare that link on how to implement a toggle thing in jquery? something like on or so
[03:22:39] <Cork> ?api on
[03:22:40] <amitprakash> $.toggle?
[03:22:44] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[03:22:50] <amitprakash> ?api toggle
[03:22:50] <b-ot> amitprakash: .toggle(): Display or hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[03:23:15] <sl33k> i want to toggle behaviours on click and unclick of a check box
[03:23:44] <Cork> sl33k: so bind click on it with on, and use toggle or toggleClass
[03:23:47] <amitprakash> sl33k, http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[03:24:12] <amitprakash> its like the first result on google :D
[03:24:19] <sl33k> Cork: is that the link?
[03:24:36] <Cork> sl33k: you've got plenty of links :)
[03:24:45] <sl33k> oh nope...on click and unclick on it, i want to select and change classes of other div elements
[03:25:07] <sl33k> i dont need to toggle its visibilty at all actually.
[03:25:31] <sl33k> its like a More Advance Option checkbox. where i show more details of some other divs
[03:25:34] <Cork> sl33k: $(':checkbox').on('click', function() { $('div').toggleClass('something', $(this).prop('checked'); });
[03:25:38] <amitprakash> lol
[03:25:48] <Cork> bah wrong
[03:25:54] <Cork> sl33k: $(':checkbox').on('click', function() { $('div').toggleClass('something', $(this).prop('checked')); });
[03:26:14] <Wuggly> any jquery ui free tool for tabs based image slider?
[03:27:12] <sl33k> why do i need this part?
[03:27:29] <Cork> "this part"?
[03:27:34] <Krambiorix> Cork so i can do $(this) = this.. ??
[03:27:42] <Cork> Krambiorix: no
[03:27:59] <Cork> Krambiorix: what is it you're trying to do?
[03:28:17] <Cork> Krambiorix: you can't assign to a function call
[03:28:42] <amitprakash> isn't 'this' universal to all languages?
[03:28:48] <sl33k> Cork: $(this).prop('checked')); });
[03:28:50] <Cork> no
[03:29:07] <Cork> sl33k: it is so the toggle doesn't get out of sync with the state of the checkbox
[03:29:20] <Krambiorix> Cork,  i have an element  , <li data-id="...." data-type="...">   And i call a function onclick on that ... so i get <this> in the function but i want to get the data attributes
[03:29:28] <Cork> $(this).prop('checked') will return true or false depending on the state of the checkbox
[03:29:40] <amitprakash> Krambiorix, $(this).attr('data-attribute-name');
[03:29:49] <Cork> Krambiorix: so $(this).data('id') ?
[03:30:05] <amitprakash> jquery has .data() now? :O
[03:30:08] <Cork> or var self = $(this); self.data('id')
[03:30:15] <Cork> amitprakash: has had for a long time
[03:30:38] <Krambiorix> Cork, yes , i tried that but it's undefined...
[03:30:39] <sl33k> Cork: so that is what it is toggled based on. :)
[03:30:40] <Cork> amitprakash: setting through data can have it's caveats though
[03:31:03] <Cork> Krambiorix: how are you binding the function to click?
[03:31:12] <Cork> sl33k: yes
[03:31:31] <Cork> sl33k: you can do just toggleClass('something') but then it might get out of sync
[03:31:31] <Krambiorix> Cork, <li onclick="myfunction()"...>
[03:31:38] <Cork> Krambiorix: there's your problem
[03:31:59] <Cork> remove the inline event attribute and use an event handler
[03:32:26] <Cork> Krambiorix: the way you do it this will be window
[03:32:34] <Cork> not the clicked element
[03:33:04] <Cork> suggesting something like $('#id-of-ul').on('click', 'li', myfunction);
[03:33:33] <Krambiorix> Cork,  i tried that too, but it never got handled... That's why i use onclick=""
[03:35:09] <Cork> Krambiorix: can you make a jsfiddle?
[03:35:46] <Krambiorix> Cork, http://pastebin.com/Yeczk6Tr
[03:36:02] <Cork> ?p
[03:36:06] <Cork> ?demo
[03:36:06] <b-ot> Cork: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:40:01] <sl33k> Cork: please can you look at this: $('#blurb').toggleClass('-large', $(this).prop('checked'));
[03:40:22] <sl33k> i dont know why it doesnt change /append the class -large to my element
[03:40:42] <Cork> do you run it in a click handler on the checkbox?
[03:40:57] <Cork> try $('#blurb').toggleClass('-large', true)
[03:44:02] <frosch> Does $.each cache it's first parameter? $.each( $('#someCollection'), function () {}) -> does $('#someCollection') get called and executed every time .each loops through the elements of the collection?
[03:44:30] <Kambfhase> frosch: nope, just once
[03:44:39] <Krambiorix> Cork, can't get it to work :s http://jsfiddle.net/D5Yxh/1/
[03:45:06] <Cork> frosch: to explain it a bit more $('#someCollection') builds and array
[03:45:13] <Cork> frosch: this array is then returned from the function
[03:45:20] <Cork> and passed to $.each
[03:45:48] <frosch> Kambfhase: cool! this means I can get rid of additional var assignments and inline the $('#coll') stuff if the name of variable doesn't make anything clearer in the code thx!
[03:46:00] <Cork> Krambiorix: cause autocompete is an id not a class
[03:46:25] <frosch> Cork: ok, so $.each gets the array and then it's basically just looping through its elements...
[03:46:29] <frosch> Cork: thx
[03:46:29] <Cork> frosch: also normally you want to do $().each not $.each
[03:46:43] <Cork> frosch: not basically, it is exactly what it does
[03:46:44] <frosch> Cork: ok - why?
[03:46:49] <frosch> :)
[03:46:54] <Cork> frosch: cleaner code?
[03:47:09] <frosch> okay, because $ is a function?
[03:47:11] <amitprakash> $.each( array, function(){}) makes more sense to me
[03:47:23] <Krambiorix> Cork, so... It's an id
[03:47:25] <Cork> frosch: no cause $.each is for looping objects and arrays
[03:47:29] <ohcibi> frosch: $ is an object
[03:47:38] <Cork> uh
[03:47:41] <Cork> no it is a function...
[03:47:52] <Cork> $ is the same as jQuery
[03:48:05] <ohcibi> true, but a function still is an object in js 8-))
[03:48:34] <Cork> ohcibi: everythidng is an object except for a few value natives
[03:48:50] <ohcibi> yes
[03:49:05] <doug65536> js> print(typeof (function(){}))
[03:49:13] <b-ot> doug65536: function
[03:49:15] <ohcibi> print?
[03:49:16] <Cork> :)
[03:49:32] <ohcibi> i didnt know there is a print in js
[03:49:38] <doug65536> there isn't
[03:49:44] <Cork> ohcibi: there is for shell scripts
[03:49:53] <Cork> but not in browsers
[03:49:59] <amitprakash> in browsers too
[03:50:07] <amitprakash> launchers the print page option for me
[03:50:08] <ohcibi> wow... yes 8))
[03:50:14] <sl33k> Cork: how do an inverse, ie NOT checked on teh checked box. based on your sample code
[03:50:21] <amitprakash> which reminds me, how do I load jquery into the js shell?
[03:50:31] <Cork> amitprakash: well that's window.print, not the same thing :)
[03:50:40] <ohcibi> amitprakash: if by shell you mean node, require
[03:50:48] <Cork> amitprakash: there is a loadscript command or similar
[03:51:12] <Cork> sl33k: !$(this).prop('checked')
[03:51:21] <frosch> Cork: Regarding $().each -> I had to tought about what you said... I think I got it now. What you meant was that I should use $(someSelector).each() instead of $.each( $(someSelector), function () {}) right?
[03:51:36] <Cork> frosch: yes
[03:51:42] <frosch> Cork: ok thanks!
[03:51:48] <Krambiorix> Cork any other suggestions? I think you made a mistake
[03:51:50] <Cork> frosch: one of the biggest reason is that $().each() can chain
[03:51:52] <Kambfhase> doug65536: typeof is an operator. No need for extra parens
[03:51:57] <Cork> while $.each() can't
[03:52:03] <frosch> I see
[03:52:12] <Cork> Krambiorix: no
[03:52:46] <Cork> Krambiorix: are you using the jquery ui?
[03:53:05] <Krambiorix> Cork,  can i specify that in the jsfiddle?
[03:53:12] <Cork> yes
[03:53:18] <doug65536> Kambfhase: I usually don't, just making sure b-ot gave a result
[03:53:30] <Cork> Krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/D5Yxh/2/
[03:54:06] <Cork> Krambiorix: and if the element you target is the autocomplete, the reason your selector doesn't work is cause it doesn't exist when the selector runs
[03:54:45] <Krambiorix> Cork, yes and that's why i put onclick="" when the element's created ...
[03:54:48] <amitprakash> ohcibi, i mean spidermonkey js shell
[03:54:49] <Cork> Krambiorix: best option would be to use the select event instead
[03:55:26] <ohcibi> amitprakash: load()
[03:55:42] <amitprakash> load(absolute-path-to-js-file) ?

[04:03:18] <Krambiorix> Cork,  the select event works in the jsfiddle but not on my computer
[04:03:53] <Cork> Krambiorix: are you defining it in as a callback in the autocomplete() call?
[04:04:18] <Krambiorix> Cork, yes
[04:04:36] <Cork> Krambiorix: well it should work
[04:05:24] <teamcoltra> I have been having some server issues lately so I decided to make a basic "page loading" div so my users could have a visual cue that the page is in fact loading. I am using the top answer for http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11072759/display-a-loading-bar-before-the-entire-page-is-loaded but when the div fades out, it goes back to showing. Example: http://mods.tuebl.ca/app_dev.php/browse/author/8768
[04:05:38] <amitprakash> Instead of saying 'Hello' + username + ", Evening", is there a better way to format this? such as "Hello %s, Evening" % username?
[04:05:50] <teamcoltra> do I need to additionally set the div to have display:none? I thought fadeout did that automagically
[04:06:05] <Cork> amitprakash: not without a templating plugin
[04:06:10] <amitprakash> display: hidden != display: none
[04:06:24] <amitprakash> visibility*
[04:06:28] <Cork> teamcoltra: yes fadeOut sets display: none
[04:07:07] <amitprakash> Once the opacity reaches 0, the display style property is set to none, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page.
[04:07:10] <amitprakash> Seems so
[04:07:46] <amitprakash> Cork, string formatting sucks in js then
[04:09:47] <doug65536> amitprakash: pretty much
[04:10:11] <doug65536> nothing is stopping you from implementing that
[04:10:11] <Cork> teamcoltra: .visible-desktop is breaking it for you
[04:10:23] <Cork> teamcoltra: it has display: inherit !important;
[04:10:33] <Cork> teamcoltra: so jquery can't set it to display: none
[04:11:04] <doug65536> amitprakash: you can implement variable argument list using 'arguments' array
[04:11:32] <teamcoltra> Thanks Cork I should have thought of that… I was playing around in jsfiddle to get it to have the same problem but couldn't so I was thinking it might be a bootstrap thing. I will figure it out. Thanks for putting me on the right corse
[04:12:06] <Cork> teamcoltra: basically never use !important
[04:12:18] <Cork> it is a horror for this exact reason
[04:13:07] <Krambiorix> Cork, well it doesn't :)
[04:13:28] <Cork> Krambiorix: then make sure you don't get an error or something then
[04:14:31] <doug65536> I'm making a real jquery plugin for event debouncing. any feedback? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EMhCt/
[04:15:02] <Krambiorix> Cork,  i don't get anything, the select event is not performed :s
[04:15:08] <Krambiorix> i wish i got an error
[04:16:30] <Cork> then reduce your page to see what breaks
[04:23:50] <rgr> Whats the correct syntax/way (or is it even possible) to call an anonymous function "in the context" of a jquery element? e. that function has access to  $(this)?
[04:24:21] <Cork> rgr: .call(element_to_have_context_on)

[04:32:15] <seutje> also, it looks like  case 'stringundefinedundefined': would turn createdEvent into 'undefinedDebounced', is that intentional?
[04:33:18] <seutje> I thought it was generally best not to touch the magic arguments variable but make them defined instead
[04:33:34] <seutje> cause iirc that magic variable isn't built unless you access it
[04:34:18] <doug65536> seutje: I don't see it. the foreach iterates over each event source ('scroll', 'click' etc) and if they didn't specify the created event the key is used + 'Debounced'   example 'scrollDebounced'
[04:35:23] <seutje> foreach? I meant switch (typeof arguments[0] + typeof arguments[1] + typeof arguments[2])
[04:35:28] <doug65536> seutje: I avoided that because you have to name them, and the names are all wrong for most overloads. so I have to copy them around? is that considered better than arguments[]
[04:36:17] <seutje> doug65536: jQuery does it too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L32
[04:36:23] <doug65536> line 95 iterates through each event source ('scroll', 'click', etc). if the options for that event doesn't have createdEvent, then I make a createdEvent option with the sourceEvent + 'Debounced'
[04:37:34] <doug65536> so I should name my arguments, then have a tree of ifs that shuffle things around?
[04:37:41] <seutje> wait what? this requires you to pre-define the event types you will catch on the document? o.O
[04:38:18] <doug65536> no, you pre-define what you want to debounce. it synthesizes the event names you specify when the "debounced" event happens
[04:39:49] <doug65536> so when you get spammed with scroll events, instead you ask my plugin to generate 'myscroll' when a scroll spam starts then stops for x milliseconds
[04:39:50] <seutje> doesn't that each run after the switch case?
[04:40:42] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/EMhCt/44/
[04:40:49] <doug65536> that each runs if you use the overload used at line 113
[04:41:27] <seutje> if you .debounce('lol'), it'll result in undefinedlol
[04:41:38] <seutje> erm undefinedDebounced
[04:41:45] <doug65536> ah ok...
[04:42:09] <doug65536> I was looking at the wrong case
[04:42:20] <doug65536> thanks
[04:42:31] <sl33k> can i describe a event/handler for a dom not yet on page
[04:42:38] <sl33k> this is what my requirements demands :(
[04:42:39] <seutje> ?on
[04:42:43] <seutje> ?api on
[04:42:43] <b-ot> seutje: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:42:56] <seutje> sl33k: ^
[04:43:38] <sl33k> the doms are added far much later with ajax
[04:46:41] <fn> i use "li { display: inline-block; }", if i want to fadeIn some of those li with "$('li').fadeIn(500);" jquery change the css attr to "display:list-item" - how can i fix that?
[04:47:15] <Cork> fn: are you setting display: none; somewhere?
[04:47:28] <Cork> if you are use .hide() instead
[04:47:59] <fn> amazing, thx. :D
[04:49:12] <TomiK> hey... is it possible to set an input field like a "required" field was missing when submitting a form ?
[04:49:38] <seutje> doug65536: this kinda works, but not as you'd expect :P .debounce('scroll').on('undefinedDebounced', function(){ console.log('WAT?'); });
[04:49:48] <TomiK> I mean apply the same CSS as browser does when required="required" and the field is not filled
[04:50:01] <Cork> Tomashe: you could style it by hand, but not you can't fake the error states
[04:50:11] <doug65536> seutje: lol, yes, but I fixed it :)
[04:50:13] <Cork> *but no you can't
[04:50:17] <seutje> you can like .debounce('scroll').debounce('click').on('undefinedDebounced', function() { console.log('catch all the events!'); });
[04:50:42] <TomiK> Cork: talking to me ?
[04:50:53] <Cork> TomiK: opps, correct
[04:51:11] <TomiK> ok, then I have to do it the old school style
[04:51:50] <doug65536> seutje: you can do that. good observation, I should add string,string overload so you can do .debounce('click','anything').debounce('scroll','anything').on('anything' ...
[04:52:06] <seutje> actually, click doesn't seem to work
[04:52:36] <seutje> wait, kinda does o.O
[04:52:51] <doug65536> seutje: what's wrong?
[04:53:18] <seutje> I'm an idiot an bound it to a different element than I thought
[04:53:27] <seutje> carry on!
[04:53:32] <doug65536> ok thanks :)
[04:53:48] <sl33k> seutje: on doesnt seem to work. the selector i am using may not have been added to the page
[04:53:58] <seutje> sl33k: did u read the docs?
[04:54:12] <sl33k>  $('a .accordion-toggle').on('click', function() {
[04:54:16] <sl33k> yes
[04:54:23] <sl33k> my alert isnt showing too
[04:54:30] <seutje> didn't read hard enough
[04:54:31] <seutje> $(document).on(eventName, 'a.accordion-toggle', function(){})
[04:55:23] <sl33k> grrrr
[04:55:34] <seutje> specifically this bit: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[04:55:50] <sidd> hi doug65536 , this is a follow up on the help you had provided day befor on one of my problems. I need to alert an error in case the value returned is 'FALSE'. the link is jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/8
[04:55:55] <sl33k> clinical you
[04:55:59] <sidd> thanks for helping :)
[04:56:07] <seutje> basically, u bind to a static parent element and within the handler, it'll check to see if that selector you passed matches
[04:56:13] <seutje> if so, it'll call your handler
[04:56:16] <rynkan> is there a way to make clicks only register on a nontransparent part of a png?
[04:56:25] <seutje> rynkan: use SVG
[04:56:39] <seutje> or masks, but they're kinda... wonky
[04:56:46] <seutje> or an image map
[04:56:54] <seutje> but that's like lol90s
[04:57:01] <rynkan> masks?
[04:57:08] <seutje> and really annoying to deal with on the JS side
[04:57:10] <rynkan> cant use svg
[04:57:42] <rynkan> What are masks? as in, what do i search for on google
[04:58:02] <Cork> rynkan: you can use canvas to calculate the transparent areas
[04:58:17] <Cork> and then grab the x y position in the element and from that create a mask
[04:58:30] <rynkan> Heres what im working on:
[04:58:39] <doug65536> sidd: looking...
[04:58:48] <seutje> I actually meant css masks, but not sure if you can use them to influence events
[04:58:53] <seutje> canvas solution could work
[04:58:56] <Cork> rynkan: i think i saw a blog about this a few weeks back
[04:59:10] <ddssc> why doens't this work http://jsfiddle.net/RhkC3/1/ ? the dialog should have "test" in the text box...
[04:59:34] <doug65536> sidd: you mean when the json is [false] ?
[04:59:50] <Cork> rynkan: http://christianheilmann.com/2013/06/15/image-masking-with-html5-canvas/
[05:00:05] <r3dpalm> Hi, How to open native video player from a webpage (MOBILES)?
[05:00:26] <rynkan> I got a set of png-images that i put ontop of each other, they form a somplete room together, now I have to deteckt clicks/taps/swipes on each png-layer (every layer is an item, like on oven for a kitchen) to change the item-model/color
[05:00:30] <sidd> doug65536: when either weight or occu_name returns 'FALSE'. ( the sql is prepped to return the string in case of mismatch)
[05:00:33] <Cork> r3dpalm: that's up to the browser
[05:02:04] <r3dpalm> Cork: thanks for the quick reply.. But Iphone browser does this things
[05:02:22] <doug65536> sidd: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/8Cqrr/9/
[05:02:29] <Cork> r3dpalm: only option i can think of is to link to the raw file
[05:02:32] <rynkan> think canvas is the only way to go
[05:02:39] <Cork> r3dpalm: and that might trigger the browser to redirect it
[05:02:50] <Cork> rynkan: canvas or svg is the only two options
[05:02:52] <doug65536> sidd: do you mean the string "FALSE" or do you mean php FALSE
[05:02:56] <rynkan> never work for ikea ^^
[05:03:04] <Cork> rynkan: well you CAN use the old map tag too
[05:03:15] <Cork> but then you have to map out the transparent areas manually
[05:03:34] <rynkan> Cork: cant, the artists would refuse map out items to manually
[05:03:59] <sidd> doug65536: the string "FALSE"
[05:04:14] <sidd> doug65536: am testing what you have written...
[05:04:19] <doug65536> sidd: bad idea...
[05:04:38] <doug65536> sidd: why can't the occu_name be FALSE
[05:04:52] <sidd> doug65536: its the name of a person.
[05:04:52] <doug65536> sidd: it might not be likely, but it's possible
[05:05:06] <rynkan> Cork & seutje thanks
[05:05:15] * rynkan site is up http://lwc.ikea.com/us/en
[05:05:35] <doug65536> sidd: a user could put "FALSE" in a field. but you can *never* read false (the actual boolean value) from the name field
[05:05:36] <sidd> doug65536: it actually has both name and surname. very very highly unlikely i meet someone who's called FALSE and has no surname. (i hope) :)
[05:05:56] <Krambiorix> Cork, i found out why the select event in the autocomplete wasn't triggered.... -> data('ui-autocomplete')._renderItem = function( ul, item ) { -> without this it works... But i need that _renderItem...
[05:06:06] <sidd> doug65536: i get you.
[05:07:02] <sidd> doug65536: i could probably tweak the sql to return 0/1 as the form validates the field to accept only alphabets
[05:07:05] <ddssc> why doens't this work http://jsfiddle.net/RhkC3/1/ ? the dialog should have "test" in the text box...
[05:07:47] <doug65536> sidd: if at all possible, avoid "magic" values. make exceptional values a different type if possible, so every possible sequence of text can work
[05:08:02] <sidd> doug65536: hmmmm....true. a good idea.
[05:08:22] <doug65536> sidd: or better yet, make the server completely fail the ajax request and not return anything
[05:08:54] <doug65536> sidd: or, perhaps better than that, send a separate success/fail piece of information with the result, so you can peek at that first to see if you got valid data
[05:09:03] <sidd> doug65536: i need to know what fails to prompt on the screen.
[05:09:31] <doug65536> sidd: ok, you can send that too. you can send an error message, and let the server tell the browser what error to show
[05:09:52] <sidd> doug65536: so option 2 seems better. if what you have written helps me get value of the existing variables, i'll pass new ones indicating success of each fiels and process them first
[05:10:01] <Muhyee> Hey guys
[05:11:02] <sidd> i know am asking too much but could you sort of use a variable called errcode and process it for 0/1 and set values of html ids only if errcode is 0? please...:)
[05:11:47] <ohcibi> is !0 somehow more efficient than true? I see it all over the place in a script here
[05:11:56] <doug65536> ohcibi: it is shorter
[05:12:12] <ohcibi> ah, sure, it saves chars...
[05:12:46] <doug65536> ohcibi: probably a tiny bit less efficient actually
[05:13:33] <doug65536> ohcibi: a js engine hopefully does constant folding. if it doesn't do that it does no optimizations whatsoever
[05:14:17] <doug65536> ohcibi: so my guess is, it takes a few microseconds longer to compile the js to an AST
[05:14:29] <ohcibi> i know... I did constant folding in prolog for university, and after that I got all the other optimizations almost for free 8-))
[05:15:05] <sidd> doug65536: got it. was able to do it myself. thanks a lot.
[05:15:11] <doug65536> sidd: np
[05:20:26] <sl33k> is there the idea of not selector? on click on a link, i want to remove a class from all collections minus  the guy that triggered it. e.g $('#faqMark a.accordion-toggle').removeClass('active');
[05:20:45] <doug65536> sl33k: yes
[05:21:14] <doug65536> $('.someclass').not('.ugly').hide();
[05:21:28] <doug65536> hides all the .someclass that don't have class ugly
[05:22:02] <sl33k> doug65536: i want to d a not this. $(this)
[05:22:13] <sl33k> doug65536: how would that work please?
[05:22:27] <doug65536> try .not(this)... I think that would work
[05:23:02] <doug65536> sl33k: just checked. it would work
[05:24:24] <sl33k> doug65536: works great!
[05:25:09] <doug65536> sl33k: just a heads up, the opposite of .not is .filter
[05:25:27] <doug65536> sl33k: people often make the mistake if thinking .is is the opposite of .not
[05:25:48] <doug65536> s/if/of/
[05:27:21] <barad> hi i am using jquery validation plugin and i am getting a weird behavior. i have this code: http://pastebin.com/5Rq7xKsZ and console.log(value <= $(param).val()); returns false when I have 2 in value and 10 in $(param).val(). if i multiply both by 10 the result gets true. am i doing something wrong?
[05:28:29] <Kambfhase> barad: print(typeof (function(){})) is a string, not a number. go convert it
[05:28:39] <seutje> barad: are you sure these are the types you assume them to be?
[05:28:54] <seutje> ah boo, I wanted to have him figure it out by himself :(
[05:29:08] <Kambfhase> :P
[05:29:29] <seutje> but uhm, the function is being executed
[05:29:33] <Kambfhase> oh wait, i fail at c&p :/
[05:29:47] <barad> ok will try that. thank you
[05:29:47] <seutje> but it's still a string ;)
[05:29:56] <seutje> ?mdn parseInt
[05:29:57] <b-ot> seutje: parseInt - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt
[05:29:58] <Kambfhase> got lucky there.
[05:30:03] <seutje> it's the shit!
[05:30:05] <barad> thanks
[05:30:08] <seutje> or shInt!
[05:30:14] <doug65536> lol
[05:30:26] <Kambfhase> The cool kids use ~~
[05:31:09] <seutje> yeah, so... screw being cool
[05:31:26] <doug65536> aw, and I thought >>0 was clever
[05:32:35] <ddssc> in $.post(..., function(data) {}) . where can I find the docu for the data object?
[05:36:04] <doug65536> ddssc: in $.ajax probably
[05:36:16] <doug65536> ddssc: $.post is just a wrapper that calls $.ajax
[05:36:35] <doug65536> ddssc: there isn't much to document. it is the response
[05:36:56] <seutje> I hate those shorthand methods
[05:37:05] <doug65536> ddssc: the last parameter to post (after that function) can be 'json' in which case data is already an object
[05:37:48] <AzizLight> Hi everybody
[05:37:55] <seutje> hi doctor AzizLight!
[05:37:59] <ddssc> doug65536: nI know that.  I'm talking about the object that gets passed to the callbck function. nvm I'll just debug it...
[05:38:00] <seutje> sry :x
[05:38:15] <doug65536> ddssc: it is the response
[05:38:24] <AzizLight> is it a known bug that .focus() doesn't work in firefox? Here is a good example: http://jsfiddle.net/Tbmk5/1/
[05:38:25] <seutje> ddssc: that's what he is talking about as well
[05:39:13] <doug65536> ddssc: you called the parameter 'data', so when I said 'data' I was talking about that
[05:39:14] <ph88> are files from CDN loaded async or do i need to use jQuery for it ?  (js, css, images)
[05:40:13] <doug65536> ph88: modern browsers will load it async for you without you having to worry about anything
[05:41:08] <doug65536> ph88: by 'async' I mean, it will get started downloading it ASAP, but to the programmer it appears as though it was all synchronous
[05:42:04] <doug65536> ph88: the whole idea of a cdn is that it will almost certainly be cached, so there is no "download"
[05:43:56] <doug65536> ph88: in reality, when using a cdn, the script download will be a fraction of a second the first time, then instantaneous from then on
[05:44:38] <ph88> thx doug65536
[05:44:40] <doug65536> ph88: cdn's send headers that tell the browser to cache aggressively
[05:45:16] <ph88> doug65536:  do you know where i should put loading of images from cdn ?  in a css from cs it refer to an image  background: url('select2.png') right top no-repeat;     how do i put that image from CDN on my page ?
[05:45:35] <ph88>  //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/select2/3.4.1/select2.png
[05:46:20] <AzizLight> specifically, that's what I am trying to do, but it doesn't work in Firefox: http://jsfiddle.net/Tbmk5/2/ When you load (or reload) the page it seems like it's working, but if you "Run" the code in jsfiddle it doesn't work...
[05:46:55] <ddssc> doug65536: found docu. http://api.jquery.com/Types/#PlainObject. here are its contents on .fail - http://pastebin.com/5XXquD1R
[05:53:56] <doug65536> ddssc: that's the xhr
[05:54:01] <doug65536> right?
[05:54:21] <krupnik> hey all
[05:54:36] <krupnik> quesiton
[05:54:41] <krupnik> question even
[05:54:56] <doug65536> ddssc: that's in $.post?
[05:55:25] <doug65536> ph88: that must work. let me try it
[05:55:41] <krupnik> I've an xml document - I'd like to loop over the child nodes of "scores_entry" and store the result as a variable or into an object that I can then access later
[05:55:44] <seutje> ddssc: yeah, looks like jqXHR to me
[05:55:49] <ph88> doug65536: i just don't know what html  or javascript to write to use it on the page
[05:56:03] <Kambfhase> krupnik: thats not a question
[05:56:11] <krupnik> how do I do this
[05:56:13] <ddssc> doug65536:  yea that's the callback return data
[05:56:16] <seutje> wow, forreal?
[05:56:20] <ddssc> err object
[05:56:35] <doug65536> I guess that object implements .toString() that gives you the response
[05:57:32] <seutje> ddssc: any change you could post the code that leads to that being in the data object?
[05:57:37] <seutje> chance*
[05:57:50] <doug65536> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gjCqm/
[05:58:29] <doug65536> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gjCqm/1/
[05:59:07] <doug65536> ph88: you mentioned css so I guessed it was a background. apparently not, you probably want img?
[05:59:07] <Kambfhase> krupnik: var childs = $(#.scores_entry').children();
[05:59:19] <Kambfhase> or something like that
[05:59:38] <doug65536> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gjCqm/2/
[05:59:44] <ph88> doug65536: options 1 is not good because the css is also loaded from CDN, option 2 is not good too because i don't place the img in html myself but it's done by the JS which is also loaded by CDN
[06:00:08] <doug65536> ph88: cdn's don't require any special consideration
[06:00:18] <doug65536> ph88: what makes you think you need to do something special?
[06:00:40] <krupnik> Kambfhase: thanks- is there a way i could then take the returned children() and set each as properties of an object?
[06:00:53] <ph88> oh i don't expect that the css from cdn will load the images from the same cdn ... but maybe it will o_O
[06:01:13] <Kambfhase> yes, but what is the key supposed to be?
[06:01:16] <ddssc> seutje: http://pastebin.com/tXZ7zbw1
[06:01:51] <krupnik> Kambfhase: could I preset a series of empty keys and then overwrite?
[06:02:17] <doug65536> ph88: ok, I'll do it in js. it doesn't make any difference: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gjCqm/3/
[06:02:35] <Kambfhase> nope. Each key also the empty string can store only one element
[06:02:56] <Kambfhase> but in my code `childs` is an array, why not use that?
[06:03:44] <krupnik> Kambfhase: that sounds sensible
[06:04:43] <doug65536> ph88: you might as well forget that things come from a cdn, you don't care as a programmer. there is no special treatment. it just happens to be almost definitely cached on the machine and/or will be aggressively cached if it needed to be downloaded. that's it
[06:06:07] <ph88> thx a lot doug65536  :)
[06:09:04] <seutje> ddssc: yeah, first argument is the XHR
[06:09:19] <seutje> second is textstatus, third is data
[06:10:05] <seutje> ddssc: Type: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[06:10:10] <doug65536> ph88: and just to address your comment that I missed. there is no requirement for images referenced in a css come from the same server. a css file from one server could load images from 100 different servers. it wouldn't matter
[06:11:42] <doug65536> seutje: was my speculation correct? does .toString() on an xhr give you the response?
[06:12:30] <seutje> doug65536: well, no, it's an object

[06:12:50] <b-ot> seutje: [object Object]
[06:12:54] <seutje> it'll say object Object
[06:12:59] <doug65536> no... watch

[06:15:16] <b-ot> seutje: YAY!
[06:15:26] <seutje> shouldn't blame the bot for your syntax errors :(
[06:15:38] <doug65536> it should report errors though... that's what I meant
[06:16:05] <seutje> fork it and fix it!

[06:19:10] <Kambfhase> meh
[06:19:38] <yannickoo> hey guys, i have multiple forms and some new forms can inserted via ajax. i have a $('form').on('submit') but that does not trigger on the *new* forms, how could i solve that?
[06:20:06] <doug65536> seutje: it's no wonder it is so slow! ideone has very long response times
[06:20:56] <seutje> yeah, it doesn't support blatant syntax errors
[06:22:01] <seutje> js> print(""+{toString: function(){return "lol";}});
[06:22:09] <b-ot> seutje: lol
[06:22:38] <Kambfhase> The bot used to run rhino.
[06:22:59] <seutje> php> print('could it do this back then?');
[06:23:04] <Cork> js> "use strict"; var a = { b => "works" }; print(a.b())
[06:23:06] <seutje> right, php tags -_-
[06:23:06] <b-ot> seutje: print('could it do this back then?');
[06:23:12] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:23:19] <seutje> php> <?php print('could it do this back then?'); ?>
[06:23:26] <b-ot> seutje: could it do this back then?
[06:23:41] <Cork> is the actual script tag needed?
[06:23:51] <Cork> kinda silly :)
[06:23:54] <seutje> yeah, otherwise it's just printed literally
[06:23:58] <seutje> that's how php works
[06:24:03] <doug65536> Cork: it parses it as a real php source file
[06:24:04] <Cork> well no not really
[06:24:14] <Cork> seutje: that how embeded php works
[06:24:15] <Kambfhase> Cork: { b => "works" } << this is not valid ES5 afaik
[06:24:20] <yannickoo> anyone with binding form.on('submit') for new forms?
[06:24:21] <Kambfhase> ES6
[06:24:34] <Cork> Kambfhase: ya, it's harmony
[06:24:34] <seutje> echo print('lol'); > foo.php, running foo will just print "print('lol');"
[06:24:55] <Cork> ?g ecmascript arrow function
[06:24:55] <b-ot> Cork: Arrow function syntax - ES Wiki - ECMAScript → http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:arrow_function_syntax
[06:25:18] <doug65536> php>  This is literal <?php echo 5*5; ?> This is also literal
[06:25:25] <seutje> doug65536: this way, it also doesn't require any custom guarding against fuckers trying to break it
[06:25:25] <b-ot> doug65536: This is literal 25 This is also literal
[06:25:35] <Kambfhase> Cork: but within curly braces?
[06:25:36] <seutje> now all that is delegated to a service devoted to just that
[06:26:01] <Cork> Kambfhase: for a member on an object ya
[06:26:47] <Kambfhase> oh, so thats  a method? handy.
[06:26:53] <Cork> Kambfhase: yes
[06:26:58] <Cork> with implicit return
[06:27:13] <seutje> I don't like the arrows
[06:27:23] <Cork> i don't like the implicity :)
[06:27:40] <Kambfhase> Not yet in Firefox :(
[06:28:03] <doug65536> Cork: you mean fat arrow?
[06:28:38] <Cork> Kambfhase: it is, but you need to fiddle to get it running
[06:29:42] <doug65536> Cork: funny, the requirement to explicitly use .call to pass this was considered a design mistake. now we want it that way :)
[06:30:22] <Cork> doug65536: well no, they removed this all together
[06:31:03] <doug65536> Cork: really? oh I thought it just inherited 'this' from the caller
[06:31:43] <yannickoo> here is the fiddle, maybe somebody know how to attach the submit event to the new forms http://jsfiddle.net/2WEPp/
[06:31:45] <Cork> doug65536: this isn't set in the arrow function unless you set it as the first argument
[06:31:50] <Cork> anyway afk
[06:33:45] <doug65536> yannickoo: maybe not the best way http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2WEPp/1/
[06:34:18] <doug65536> yannickoo: a more ideal implementation would put the submit handler on a parent so it handles any submit from its children
[06:34:36] <yannickoo> doug65536: something like $('body form') ß
[06:34:53] <yannickoo> doug65536, no does not work
[06:34:56] <doug65536> yannickoo: no that would only attach to the ones that are active at that moment
[06:35:16] <doug65536> $('body').on('submit', 'form', submitHandler);
[06:35:32] <doug65536> then you don't ever need to attach submit to new things
[06:36:26] <doug65536> yannickoo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2WEPp/3/
[06:37:02] <doug65536> yannickoo: realistically, you need more...
[06:38:56] <doug65536> yannickoo: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2WEPp/6/
[06:39:15] <yannickoo> doug65536: what is the different?
[06:39:17] <doug65536> yannickoo:  oops: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2WEPp/7/
[06:39:32] <doug65536> yannickoo: in the submitHandler I use e.target to find which form it was
[06:39:39] <yannickoo> doug65536: ah!
[06:40:38] <yannickoo> doug65536: thank you :)
[06:40:43] <doug65536> yannickoo: yw
[06:41:15] <meatwad5675> I'm having a jquery UI sortable problem
[06:42:45] <yannickoo> doug65536: but why does it work with .live but not with .on?
[06:43:01] <doug65536> yannickoo: you are using old jquery
[06:43:15] <yannickoo> doug65536: yeah but why is that live functionality not in the current 2.0.3?
[06:43:39] <doug65536> yannickoo: it was deprecated for a while and eventually removed
[06:43:44] <meatwad5675> I'm setting up a UI for editing a site header (reordering items vertically, etc…) that is also a psuedo preview.  One option is to make the navigation fixed to the top of the window.  However, as soon as I add some CSS in my preview window to absolutely position my sortable element, it wont sort anymore.
[06:43:50] <doug65536> yannickoo: because .on is a better way to do .live
[06:43:52] <meatwad5675> http://jsfiddle.net/JnFWu/
[06:43:53] <yannickoo> doug65536: do you know a better workaround?
[06:44:04] <doug65536> yannickoo: you must use .live?
[06:44:39] <doug65536> yannickoo: here's a better question: what version of jquery are you using?
[06:44:40] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: upgrade your skills.
[06:44:51] <NoiseEee> take the 20 seconds to learn how to use .on
[06:44:55] <meatwad5675> I added some js to try to remove my positioning CSS on the sortstart event, but it isn't working
[06:44:57] <yannickoo> doug65536: i want to use live because tracking dom changes should be a must have :s
[06:45:05] <NoiseEee> yannickoo: that is what .on() is for.
[06:45:14] <yannickoo> NoiseEee: i know how to use on but i though that on includes .live
[06:45:27] <doug65536> yannickoo: everything calls .on now
[06:45:41] <doug65536> yannickoo: the other ones are wrappers that call .on
[06:46:04] <yannickoo> doug65536: sure
[06:47:21] <doug65536> yannickoo: live didn't track anything. it simply let the events bubble up to the top of the DOM and handled everything there (I think)
[06:47:30] <yannickoo> ah got it:
[06:47:32] <yannickoo> $('body').on('click', 'form', function() {});
[06:48:09] <doug65536> yes... but
[06:48:35] <doug65536> yannickoo: $('body').on('click', 'form', function(event) { var form = $(event.target);  ... });
[06:48:44] <yannickoo> doug65536: right
[06:51:00] <meatwad5675> @doug65536 - be careful with event.target vs. event.currentTarget when using .on in that way
[06:51:27] <meatwad5675> I think event.target will give you the clicked element, while event.currentTarget will give you the form
[06:51:54] <meatwad5675> any jqueryUI gurus out there?
[06:53:33] <doug65536> the 'form' is just a selector, it could be 'form input[name="firstname"]' http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/2WEPp/11/
[06:53:37] <doug65536> yannickoo: ^
[06:54:04] <yannickoo> cool :)
[06:54:47] <doug65536> meatwad5675: thanks. so I usually want currentTarget for things like mouse events, right?
[06:55:28] <doug65536> meatwad5675: or is currentTarget == $('body') ?
[06:55:59] <doug65536> meatwad5675: in $('body').on ...
[06:56:18] <meatwad5675> doug65536:  here's how I understand it (someone correct me if I'm wrong)
[06:57:14] <angela> hi, I have a fixed element, but I would like to adjust some values when user scroll
[06:57:28] <angela> because the page is position absolute, no content will change
[06:57:38] <angela> but I would still like to obtain the height for which user has scrolled
[06:57:53] <angela> in order to tweak the values, what should I use?
[06:58:09] <meatwad5675> doug65536: if you have <div class="foo"><a></a></div>, then $('body').on('click','.foo',function(){})
[06:59:00] <meatwad5675> doug65536: a click on the link will give you the link as your target and the div and your currentTarget
[06:59:18] <meatwad5675> doug65536: not sure which property of the event object the body is
[06:59:35] <doug65536> meatwad5675: body would be 'this'
[06:59:54] <meatwad5675> yes, true
[07:01:48] <doug65536> wouldn't that imply that (num_parents^2)/2 events bubble up??
[07:02:17] <meatwad5675> doug65536: I believe the event bubbles up to the body where the listener is, and then the listener traverses the body looking for .foo, giving you your event.currentTarget
[07:02:27] <doug65536> ok good lol
[07:03:57] <doug65536> meatwad5675: something along the lines of currentTarget =  $(event.target).closest('...selector from on...')
[07:04:46] <doug65536> except itself would count
[07:05:12] <doug65536> an imaginary .closestOrMyself(...
[07:07:38] <ajpiano> doug65536: the first element that closest looks at is the element itself
[07:07:58] <doug65536> ajpiano: ah cool
[07:11:22] <doug65536> angela: use to do what? find how far they scrolled down?
[07:11:32] <angela> doug65536: yeap
[07:12:59] <doug65536> angela: $('body').scrollTop()
[07:17:26] <meatwad5675> anyone out there good with jQuery UI?  Having sortable() problems...

[07:21:47] <rogeruiz> meatwad5675: your example seems to be working. what's the problem?
[07:22:10] <shafox> Hey, I ran into a problem. How to measure the height of the browser so that the web page of the app will stay in that one screen size .
[07:22:14] <airdem> where can i get kineticjs support? you guys know any irc chan?
[07:22:25] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: click the "make nav one fixed" checkbox and then try to reorder nav one
[07:23:08] <Cork> shafox: $(window).height() should give you that
[07:23:51] <rogeruiz> i see. you don't want it draggable? meatwad5675
[07:24:10] <meatwad5675> I do want it draggable
[07:24:19] <shafox> Cork: I am doing that but my main concern is , i have 4 divs that all divs has to show up in the screen height individually , like one div per screen when scroll next div will show
[07:24:47] <Cork> shafox: so make them height: 100%
[07:24:53] <Cork> + same on html and body
[07:25:45] <shafox> Cork: ok
[07:26:35] <Cork> shafox: http://jsfiddle.net/CDmMn/
[07:27:48] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: it looks like sorting moves the element, but also tries to revert positioning CSS back to its original state when you drop it.
[07:28:23] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: in this case, it is adding inline CSS to the element after it's dropped that I don't want there.
[07:29:19] <rogeruiz> I see
[07:29:26] <rogeruiz> so the element is moved around in the DOM
[07:29:33] <rogeruiz> and you'd like to prevent it from doing that
[07:29:39] <Xander1> hi everyone
[07:29:54] <shafox> Cork: thanks only a css tweak
[07:30:01] <rogeruiz> meatwad5675: ^^
[07:30:29] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: no I want it to move around the DOM freely, I just don't want the inline CSS added after dropping.
[07:31:10] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: maybe I can hook to the sortend event and remove any inline styles
[07:31:51] <googol7> hi, got a question concerning ajax timeout. if i define a timeout of 1 second and the server answers after 9 seconds i get a timeout error (as expected). if the server only answers after 10 seconds i get a 404 error. why is that?
[07:32:17] <rogeruiz> ah I see
[07:32:35] <doug65536> googol7: 404 means file not found
[07:32:40] <Cork> googol7: that would only happen if you connect again...
[07:32:46] <Cork> and to a different url
[07:33:07] <googol7> doug65536: i know what 404 means ;) thanks though
[07:33:11] <googol7> cork: hmm - i see
[07:33:45] <Cork> googol7: if the timeout happens after 1 sec, it wouldn't matter what the server does after 1.1 sec+
[07:34:10] <googol7> there are several ajax calls - at least one should return a timeout - but they all return 404
[07:34:14] <Cork> cause the browser would close the connection
[07:34:26] <Cork> googol7: then the server returns the 404
[07:34:30] <Cork> not the browser
[07:34:39] <Xander1> anyone familiar with jeditable - http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable
[07:34:43] <rogeruiz> meatwad5675: give this a short http://jsfiddle.net/JnFWu/1/
[07:34:44] <rogeruiz> shot*
[07:34:58] <Xander1> i'm trying to get it to work in bootstrap modal but it stop working if user closes modal window
[07:35:20] <Xander1> it works on first time, but then if user tries to open modal window again- it won't start up again
[07:36:07] <googol7> cork: the timeout is 1 sec. i slow down the server so that it answers only after 9 seconds and it returns a timeout error. but if i slow it down even more so that it answers only after 10 seconds - i get the 404. do you know what i mean? it's the same test condition - just the slowness of the server differs. i would expect it to return a timeout in both cases.
[07:36:33] <Cork> googol7: then you don't set a timeout of 1 sec
[07:36:45] <Cork> googol7: cause it isn't possible to get 404 over a closed connection
[07:37:30] <googol7> cork: it's a clean test run from scratch - i don't reconnect or use the same connection or anything
[07:37:38] <googol7> and the timeout is always 1 sec
[07:37:53] <googol7> the url is also the same
[07:38:40] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: Ha, perfect.  You were probably confused because I forgot to update my JsFiddle, so what you were looking at was never working properly
[07:39:02] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: here is the updated working version: http://jsfiddle.net/JnFWu/4/
[07:39:11] <meatwad5675> rogeruiz: Thanks!
[07:39:29] <rogeruiz> meatwad5675: no problem. glad I could help
[07:40:39] <Cork> googol7: http://jsfiddle.net/vPwmB/1/
[07:40:41] <Cork> wfm
[07:40:56] <Cork> it starts the connection then aborts it
[07:41:12] <petey> Do you guys have any tips for taking a chunk out of your website and posting it here?
[07:41:26] <Cork> ?p
[07:41:28] <petey> I have a jquery problem I can't figure out and I want to put it in the fiddle but do I paste the whole website?
[07:41:49] <Cork> petey: build a working example in jsfiddle.net
[07:41:51] <rogeruiz> petey: Paste only what you need to have it show up in the fiddle
[07:41:52] <petey> I tried recreating just a part of the site but it isn't really recreating the error
[07:41:58] <rogeruiz> only you can determine that
[07:42:06] <petey> Alright I'm going to mess around for a sec
[07:44:39] <googol7> Cork: doesn't do anything
[07:44:50] <Cork> googol7: check the network log
[07:45:20] <Cork> you will see a connection with a 301 and then a new connection and directly after both goes into abort
[07:47:37] <Nebros> hi all
[07:48:57] <Nebros> i have this in a code <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script> i think 1.7.1 is no more acuel. is there a variant to be always actuel?
[07:49:34] <Cork> Nebros: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[07:50:24] <Nebros> thx
[07:50:36] <NoiseEee> Nebros: host it yourself.
[07:50:54] <NoiseEee> Nebros: you don't want to link to the latest version like that ^^^ and then one day find your site broken
[07:51:31] <Nebros> its not my site. i try to clear all problems :)
[07:53:11] <slax0r> Nebros, I'd suggest downloading the lib and loading it from a local dir(local to your server)
[07:53:52] <Cork> well you can shave quite a bit of time if you load it from a commonly used cdn
[07:54:03] <Nebros> and this  is better for what?
[07:54:04] <angela> hey guys, is there a good tutorial on queue & dequeue
[07:54:19] <angela> I'm having issues trying to understand how they work
[07:54:32] <slax0r> Cork, and you can be in a world of pain when your users all of a sudden start using "tracking protection"
[07:54:48] <Cork> angela: you build a queue, and if you want to call it you need to call dequeue
[07:55:01] <grafi> cant you link to a specific version on a cdn? oô
[07:55:03] <Cork> angela: animate and other similar functions does this when they run
[07:55:08] <Cork> grafi: yes
[07:55:14] <grafi> problem solved
[07:55:24] <Cork> that was kinda the original problem >_<
[07:55:28] <Cork> it linked to an old version
[07:55:42] <angela> Cork: yeah, I'm trying to learn how to pause and resume an animation
[07:55:48] <grafi> hm i see
[07:55:52] <angela> there is a delay method, but it doesn't really help because I don't have the time
[07:55:59] <grafi> well you cant have both :P
[07:56:01] <Cork> angela: you can't pause an animation through queue
[07:56:18] <angela> Cork: what?
[07:56:19] <Cork> angela: the queueu pauses between jobs, not in one animation
[07:56:29] <angela> then what should I do?
[07:56:40] <angela> stop the animation and start it again?
[07:56:43] <Cork> angela: define a partial step for the animation
[07:56:46] <Cork> or call .stop()
[07:56:52] <ggdevelop> how can  I make something happen asynchroniously?
[07:56:59] <angela> what's a partial step?
[07:57:01] <Cork> ggdevelop: use setTimeout
[07:57:22] <Cork> angela: ex. by setting to animate opacity to .5 instead of to 1 for example
[07:57:42] <angela> Cork: if I use stop, the css height property would be the height before animation starts
[07:57:55] <ggdevelop> Cork: timeout? how would that help?
[07:57:57] <Cork> angela: depends on what you animate
[07:58:14] <Cork> ggdevelop: ok, what is it your trying to do
[07:58:15] <angela> I'm animating an image floating from bottom of the window to the top
[07:58:23] <angela> in other works just top
[07:58:33] <angela> property, not even left property animation
[07:58:46] <Cork> angela: if you call stop() without jump to finish it would stop exactly where it is
[07:58:51] <ggdevelop> Cork: I want one function to happen in parrallel and not to delay the page loading
[07:59:00] <angela> Cork: I see
[07:59:03] <angela> lemme try
[07:59:05] <Cork> ggdevelop: you can't do that
[07:59:15] <Cork> ggdevelop: only option if you really need exactly that is webworkers
[07:59:27] <Cork> ggdevelop: javascript is single thread
[07:59:36] <Cork> ?g mdn webworkers
[07:59:37] <b-ot> Cork: Using web workers - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers
[08:01:15] <Cork> ggdevelop: through what you can do is break up the function into small parts and have it run through a setTimeout loop
[08:01:24] <Cork> ggdevelop: and through that make it fairly async
[08:08:41] <anew> http://pastebin.com/fxmq9jWw anyone see anything wrong with this validate?
[08:08:42] <anew> it's not working
[08:08:49] <anew> city-profile1 is the name of the input
[08:09:01] <frosch> Can I set the value of all input element but one?  Clear of :inputs of "block"  $(":input", block).val('');   but not the hidden element with name 'foo'?
[08:10:00] <doug65536> frosch: $(":input", block).not('[name="foo"]').val('')
[08:10:06] <frosch> ok i think i found it http://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/

[08:18:54] <mad_mode_on> hey I have a <select> and I'd like to know how to check wheter a certain value is already within.
[08:20:11] <NoiseEee> mad_mode_on: look for an 'option' element with the value
[08:20:24] <NoiseEee> mySelect.find('option[value="someValue"]')
[08:20:49] <mad_mode_on> let me give a try
[08:37:37] <doug65536> anew: are you sure the form has class uform? are you sure there is an element with name="city-profile1" ?
[08:38:09] <doug65536> anew: are you sure execution even makes it to that .validate call?
[08:38:19] <doug65536> anew: did you check the browser console for errors?
[08:38:19] <anew> yes to first two questions
[08:38:28] <anew> and console error is this -
[08:38:50] <anew> Unexpected identifier line 3
[08:39:23] <doug65536> well, you should show that section of code then
[08:39:55] <anew> what do u mean

[08:41:49] <anew> yes that line
[08:41:54] <anew> city-profile1: "required"
[08:42:00] <anew> but what could be wrong here
[08:42:00] <doug65536> put it in quotes. you are saying the key name is city MINUS profile1
[08:42:12] <anew> ahhhh
[08:42:14] <anew> i see
[08:42:44] <anew> bingo

[08:44:06] <janthony> I'm using jquery.ticker.js and loading it via $('#js-news').ticker({ options… }); Do you know if there is a way to kill the script w/o reloading the page, effectively stopping the script from running?
[08:45:58] <horsik> is here anyone with d3 experience?
[08:47:42] <ravenzz> janthony are you talking about this https://github.com/rhodimus/jQuery-News-Ticker plugin?
[08:48:00] <cereal> trying to change a forms action, but it hates me.  http://hastebin.com/rijaxanapi.xml  any suggestions?
[08:48:16] <janthony> ravenzz: Yes
[08:48:42] <ravenzz> janthony then no
[08:49:04] <ravenzz> it is not possible, it doesn't have any destroy method or namespaced events
[08:50:10] <janthony> ravenzz: Got it. Thanks. I extended it slightly to let me know the count of items in the feed to load a setInterval to check for new items after it got through the current items in the feed. The issue is that it keeps firing over and over, unless I have the setInterval reload the page.
[08:50:20] <amcsi_work> I have a jQuery thing where the user can toggle previous and next image with buttons. I have a bit of an inconvenience issue that if I click one of the buttons if some specific way (maybe a sort of dragging click), it text highlights the big image behind the buttons. How can I stop these highlightings from happening?
[08:50:29] <ravenzz> janthony of course you can do $.fn.ticker = $.noop but it would be almost useless
[08:51:08] <amcsi_work> actually it's because I am double clicking
[08:53:57] <holywarprofiteer> Does anyone know how the background positions change on this site: https://www.airbnb.com/jobs
[08:56:56] <ravenzz> holywarprofiteer search for parallax css
[08:58:58] <aaairc> how can i grab a uri fragment off a url... for example if it was www.mywebsite.com#access_token=12345... how would i get the access_token on initial page load?
[09:00:10] <holywarprofiteer> thanks ravenzz
[09:03:15] <ravenzz> aaairc location.hash
[09:08:36] <Nek> Hello
[09:13:56] <holywarprofiteer> ahoy hoy
[09:14:04] <aaairc> ravenzz: it seems like when facebook redirects to my website with the #access_token uri fragment, when the page loads, the fragment is removed
[09:14:15] <aaairc> so i can't detect it any longer with location.hash
[09:14:34] <aaairc> do you think my server is stripping the has off the url?
[09:16:08] <NoiseEee> aaairc: the backend doesn't get access to the url fragment / hash
[09:16:17] <aaairc> k
[09:16:35] <aaairc> will look into the javascript more
[09:37:40] <doug65536> aaairc: look for location.pushState or location.replace('#...') or location.hash(...
[09:37:51] <doug65536> location.hash = ...
[09:38:28] <doug65536> sorry, history.pushState
[09:41:03] <aaairc> yeah it had to do with history.pushState writing over the hash
[09:41:06] <aaairc> thanks!

[09:50:10] <ccmonster> hey guys, question about datetimepicker and targeting the events
[09:50:20] <rynop> I'm using  $.when() to make concurrent $.ajax() calls. How do I make it so when one fails, I can get at the response of the other $.ajax() call? here is my code: https://gist.github.com/doapp-ryanp/be44ccf70c3c3d8603b1
[09:50:30] <rogeruiz> ccmonster: jquery ui?
[09:50:37] <ccmonster> bootstrap datetimepicker.
[09:50:48] <rynop> right now it fails 'fast' - I kinda want to make it fail 'slow' in that I always want to see the responses of both requests on fail
[09:50:48] <ccmonster> http://tarruda.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/
[09:51:24] <rvr87> I've cloned an element that has some children; how can I select just the top element of the collection?
[09:52:11] <rogeruiz> rvr87: if you're just looking to select one item from a collection. use $('.selectors').eq(0) to select the first one
[09:54:11] <ccmonster> any idea rogeruiz
[09:54:55] <rogeruiz> ccmonster: I' m not sure what your question is. please provide a working example on jsfiddle and I'll take a look
[09:55:45] <ccmonster> i gave the link to the widget and such. Thought maybe you'd help determine how to target the change event.
[09:58:43] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster what are you looking to accomplish?
[09:59:20] <ccmonster> i am trying to get the change event (which doesn't seem to be working, so I have grab the contents of hte input after a selction and populate a label (for a review page on a form)
[09:59:27] <ccmonster> so I am trying to target the right events.
[10:00:12] <duch_kazatel> "the change event" - does the widget spec out some sort of custom "event" on change?  or are you simpyl trying to capture when the user picks a date?
[10:00:45] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster it looks like there's a "changeDate" event - you can bind to that easily - they provide an example on that page.
[10:01:04] <duch_kazatel> el.on('changeDate', function(e) {...});
[10:01:59] <ccmonster> yea, not working. let me fiddle.
[10:02:23] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster just make sure you ref all assets in your fiddle so the datepicker fully works :)
[10:08:33] <iman> Hi, I am using a jquery framework and I faced a problem that I need to debug some part of source code, I need something like ad-ons, when I click on button it tracks what happen after that and where it goes, do you know some tools like this ?
[10:08:42] <boaz_subway> JQUERY!
[10:09:45] <doug65536> yes, press F12 in chrome or Firefox. firefox has an alternate debugger called firebug
[10:09:48] <boaz> iman: what jquery framework are you using?
[10:10:12] <boytoy> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/33/edit (using jQuery Embedly), how do I only embed videos from YouTube and Vimeo, and not random media from random URLs using the Services API? http://embed.ly/docs/endpoints/1/service
[10:10:52] <iman> boaz: datatable, and jqury core
[10:11:03] <boaz> iman: also, I think you can accomplish that with google analytics
[10:11:11] <iman> boaz: when I click on button I want to track what happen next
[10:11:28] <boaz> try out custom events with google analytics, iman
[10:12:16] <iman> boaz: google analytics is for analytics web,not for debugging javascript
[10:13:30] <boaz> iman: you want to track what happens when a user clicks on something in order to catch bugs?
[10:14:13] <ccmonster> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/E5QmB/
[10:14:36] <SpartanWarrior> hiya guys is there something like 'focusout' that doesn't fire when the browser tab is changed? (or the browser window minimized) :(
[10:14:50] <ccmonster> so I am trying to capture the value of the datetimetpicker, and then populate it's changed value into a review type dl
[10:17:58] <boaz> iman: idk, check out crashlytics?
[10:18:03] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster sec.
[10:18:22] <ccmonster> duch_kazatel: np. thanks.
[10:18:34] <doug65536> SpartanWarrior: when you say focus out you must mean blur
[10:19:29] <doug65536> SpartanWarrior: blur is the opposite of focus. not sure if you wanted an event that tells you the user isn't looking at the page anymore
[10:20:12] <daslicht> offtopic but worth sharing: http://weavesilk.com/
[10:21:26] <SpartanWarrior> doug65536: i tried blur and focusout, both react when the user isn't looking at the page along with the behaviour i want (that is them to be fired when the user 'leaves' the focus on the element), what i want is an event that fires only when the user 'blurs' the element, not the browser window
[10:21:39] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/E5QmB/1/
[10:21:50] <duch_kazatel> the changedate event works....
[10:22:21] <ccmonster> why did you remove the other stuff?
[10:22:37] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster because it's unnecessary and JSFiddle complains ;)
[10:22:53] <duch_kazatel> all your external stuff is under "external resources"
[10:22:56] <ccmonster> haha. um. what was it complaining about? I had no complaints i dont think.
[10:22:59] <ccmonster> oh, is that a problem?
[10:23:22] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster it whines when you start trying to edit things.  that example now works.  look at the javascript.
[10:23:25] <duch_kazatel> it functions.
[10:23:42] <ccmonster> yea. i am trying to duplicate and see why when i tried that it was not clicking.
[10:23:53] <duch_kazatel> "it was not clicking"?
[10:24:10] <ccmonster> expression
[10:24:24] <chovy> Cork: so what is preferred?
[10:24:45] <doug65536> SpartanWarrior: I don't think that is possible, the primary meaning of getting a blur event is that the control does not receive keyboard input anymore. that is the case when the user switches to another window
[10:24:47] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster huh?  you're not stopping delegation or anything, right?
[10:24:59] <ccmonster> not stopping anything.
[10:25:13] <ccmonster> figure of speech. 'not clicking' . didn't mean it in any literal way.
[10:25:23] <duch_kazatel> ooooh you mean it wasn't "clicking" in your head.,
[10:25:31] <ccmonster> or on the page, figuratively.
[10:26:01] <duch_kazatel> ccmonster something tells me you have a minor order of operations issue :)
[10:26:56] <ccmonster> haha.
[10:32:24] <ccmonster> duch_kazatel: question sir. So I can access the date and such, but not the in the format that I set as an option for the lib..
[10:32:42] <kev_> hi any of you experts able to help with extending jquery datepicker ui ???
[10:32:44] <ccmonster> what looks like the best way to get the correct format back, which is yyyy-mm-dd
[10:33:08] <kev_> I want to add a section below the calendar - bit like the button bar
[10:33:35] <kev_> There I want to add a custom, but simple time picker
[10:33:45] <OnkelTem> Hi
[10:33:50] <ccmonster> damnit. this thing stops the events on the input that it handles, so I can't listen to the input's events it seems.
[10:34:23] <OnkelTem> I'd like to create elements and somehow chain this operation, like .append('ul').append('li').append('li') etc. Is there a quick way to do this?
[10:34:58] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: That should work just fine.
[10:35:29] <BillCriswell> It's kind of weird appends an li to an li but that approach is ok.
[10:35:43] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: really? Doesn't .append('ul') return its parent?
[10:36:01] <kev_> OnkelTem just create your html and append the whole lot append('<ul><li></li></ul>')
[10:36:02] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: nah, I want to preserve correct structure :)
[10:36:44] <SpartanWarrior> doug65536: in that case i'll try to rethink my solutions  thanks
[10:37:09] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: Good point. Brian fart.
[10:37:11] <ccmonster> duch_kazatel: in that example you have, how would i get he value off the input?
[10:37:16] <kev_> anyone online to help with jquery UI ??
[10:37:26] <ccmonster> but triggered by that 'changeDate' event.
[10:37:28] <BillCriswell> I agree with kev_. You shoudl just append a string of HTML. Much quicker.
[10:38:13] <OnkelTem> Btw, how can I build document fragment with jquery and only then append it to the DOM?
[10:38:32] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: It can be just a string of HTML.
[10:38:59] <BillCriswell> Or you can do like $('<span>').addClass('some-span').text('Woooo!')
[10:39:23] <BillCriswell> If you're doing this a lot should look into some kind of template parser deali.
[10:39:31] <kev_> BillCriswell how's your Datepicker UI knowledge
[10:39:44] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: hmm... $('span') will search for <span> in the DOM, while $('<span>') will create new doc fragment>?
[10:40:04] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: Yes.
[10:40:07] <OnkelTem> Cool
[10:40:19] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: thank you. Didn't know jQuery is so smart
[10:40:41] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: I still think a string is the way to go though normally!
[10:40:50] <BillCriswell> kev_: Not that good. I might be able to help though.
[10:42:12] <kev_> BillCriswell - I am OK with the fundamentals, but want to tag a box on the bottom of the calendar. I know what the #id of the container is, but I need to hook into the object in some way before it's displayed
[10:43:09] <kev_> So I can then do $('#ui-datepicker-div').append(whateverIlike)
[10:44:24] <NotreDev> anyone familiar with an "object browser" i can use in the webpage? (like firebug but for the user, and for a specified object)
[10:44:41] <duch_kazatel> NotreDev huh?
[10:45:23] <NotreDev> imagine a fairly simple object; i want the user to be able to explore it in the webpage.
[10:45:28] <kev_> BillCriswell: Did you get the last post? make any sense?
[10:45:36] <BillCriswell> Yes sorry about that.
[10:45:43] <NotreDev> was wondering if there was a package already out there..
[10:45:49] <duch_kazatel> NotreDev and why aren't you making them use some kind of developer tool...?
[10:45:55] <shoky> NotreDev: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fPRXJ/   (c) Eviltwin
[10:46:35] <NotreDev> duch_kazatel: because they're creating json objects for use by other programs
[10:47:19] <NotreDev> shoky: took me a sec to see the "object" rendering in the document. that's awesome.
[10:47:29] <BillCriswell> kev_: Do you have some demo code somewhere?
[10:48:28] <kev_> BillCriswell: I'll create a very simple version and post it - gimme 5 mins
[10:48:35] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:08:47] <kev_> BillCriswell: you still here ??
[11:08:54] <BillCriswell> Yesh.
[11:09:11] <kev_> changed nationality I see
[11:09:22] <BillCriswell> Yeah mon.
[11:09:27] <kev_> http://www.visitfyldecoast.info/jquery/
[11:13:42] <BillCriswell> kev_: Weird. Odd there isn't an afterShow or something to that effect
[11:14:17] <kev_> yesh - exactly what I thought
[11:15:53] <BillCriswell> What do you need to do with that HTML, just add something to it?
[11:16:54] <BillCriswell> kev_: ^
[11:17:01] <kev_> BillCriswell: Yes - There's an onSelect fuction I could hook into - but you have to select something from the calendar first. I already have a stepped time function to add
[11:17:51] <kev_> BillCriswell: The onSelect works similar to the beforeShow (except the HTML is visible by that time)
[11:18:25] <kev_> BillCriswell: Just wanted to add it before it got displayed
[11:18:54] <kev_> BillCriswell: Is there something like delegate for domething like this ??
[11:20:49] <BillCriswell> kev_: I'm thinking you could but it just feels dirty.
[11:21:46] <kev_> Exactly - but without extending the widget - seems like sledgehammer to crack a nut
[11:21:58] <BillCriswell> Something like this maybe? $('body').on('focusin', '#myDate', function(){ $('#selector').html() /* Hopefully? */ });
[11:22:26] <BillCriswell> Can't remember is just focus bubbles up or not. don't think it does.
[11:23:15] <kev_> just tested - focus is after dialog is displayed as well
[11:24:28] <BillCriswell> kev_: Can you just so something clever with css :after { content: "" } ?
[11:25:42] <kev_> It's an idea - what's the minimum browser support for that?
[11:27:02] <shoky> kev_: another workaround is wrapping your code in the beforeShow  setTimeout(function() { .... }, 0)
[11:27:24] <BillCriswell> kev_: IE8+
[11:27:25] <shoky> +with
[11:27:27] <kev_> BillCriswell: Looks like a borderline browser support for :after
[11:27:41] <Cork> chovy: what's preferred where?
[11:28:18] <BillCriswell> shoky: I was thinking that too but it felt dirty as well. I need to just man up and get dirty sometimes.
[11:28:51] <kev_> So trigger timer to check for prescence of dialog ???
[11:29:09] <kev_> is that how to spell prescence
[11:29:12] <kev_> :-)
[11:29:36] <BillCriswell> kev_: Close enough.
[11:29:39] <kev_> presence
[11:30:03] <BillCriswell> I prefer presents.
[11:30:05] <kev_> so back to the timer idea - have I understood correctly ??
[11:30:26] <ph88> does someone have experience with Drag N Drop ?
[11:30:40] <shoky> kev_: http://jsfiddle.net/ztYAG/12/
[11:30:43] <kev_> BillCriswell: Presents for non-dirty solutions only !
[11:32:09] <kev_> shoky: Just testing - thanks
[11:36:14] <kev_> shoky / BillCriswell : http://www.visitfyldecoast.info/jquery/
[11:36:51] <shoky> kev_: ok?
[11:37:16] <kev_> shoky: yep - excellent - one question .... dpDiv ?????
[11:37:42] <kev_> shoky: think I'm missing the link
[11:37:59] <shoky> it's a field in the datepicker instance object, points to that same div you wanted. you can do it how you were doing it too
[11:38:16] <shoky> (it's not documented i think)
[11:39:05] <kev_> shoky: No - I don't think I would have thought to reference it that way either.
[11:40:03] <kev_> shoky: inst is the options object right ??
[11:40:39] <shoky> it's the datepicker instance object
[11:42:20] <kev_> shoky: So how would I make reference to #ui-datepicker-div
[11:42:23] <kev_> ?
[11:43:04] <shoky> kev_: you already know 2 ways now.. not sure what you're asking
[11:45:21] <tab1293> can you use jquery's ajax to load a twig template block?
[11:45:37] <kev_> shoky: I'm happy I know what to do - just want to pick your brain while we're on subject. I cannot find in the HTML dpDiv - so where does it exist, and how else could I access a portion of the HTML in the datepicker instance - like you say - the documentation is lacking
[11:46:11] <ph88> why are there jQuery plugins for drag and drop, when js already has events for this ?  http://www.jquery4u.com/drag-and-drop/10-easy-jquery-drag-drop-plugins/
[11:46:33] <shoky> kev_:  inst.dpDiv  is a jquery object of that div you wanted to access. i dont know what you wanna do with it, you said you wanna .append() something to it?
[11:48:36] <shoky> kev_: for example...  inst.dpDiv.find('.ui-datepicker-title').append('WOWZA')
[11:49:23] <kev_> shoky: You know your a genius !
[11:49:32] <grafi> ;)
[11:49:36] <shoky> lol
[11:49:58] <grafi> shoky should be paid his weight in unobtainium
[11:50:46] <shoky> sounds mighty beefy
[11:50:56] <kev_> shoky: still puzzled how you know about the existence of dpDiv when the API doesn't mention it - maybe one day grasshopper ......
[11:51:06] <shoky> kev_:  console.log(inst)
[11:52:17] <grafi> :D
[11:52:21] <grafi> magic
[11:52:26] <grafi> *makes magichands*
[11:52:56] <Xander1> anyone work with jeditable?
[11:53:00] <shoky> i think they're called jazz hands
[11:53:08] <shoky> i like that better, anyhoo
[11:53:46] <kev_> shoky: Now I get it ! ......About time too he says !  Shoky / BillCriswell - many thanks

[12:02:41] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[12:02:50] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with fullcalendar plugin?
[12:04:59] <grafi> post your question anyways Bloomberg
[12:07:30] <Bloomberg> Ok, all events works perfect, the problem is that I need to show only 3 events tabs in the month view, because if I have 10 events in a day it going to grow up very much and will be outside of the square of day
[12:08:02] <Bloomberg> understand me?
[12:08:28] <grafi> link to the plugin + some sample code maybe? :)
[12:09:44] <Bloomberg> http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/
[12:10:34] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/SDs2q/
[12:10:48] <Bloomberg> that is
[12:11:48] <grafi> and what happens to the other events in the month view? do they just disappear?
[12:11:48] <ezrios> Is there a nice way to dynamically generate new content/HTML from JQuery?
[12:11:58] <ezrios> Right now I've resorted to slapping a bunch of raw HTML strings into my javascript files
[12:12:02] <grafi> i mean the user should be able to view the events, no?
[12:12:06] <ezrios> but this is quite ugly and doesn't look very maintainable
[12:12:25] <ezrios> I'm writing a small web application using ajax
[12:12:36] <Bloomberg> visually it must to disappear
[12:12:47] <Bloomberg> All is by the space of the box
[12:13:10] <grafi> does the box just grow when there are more events?
[12:13:13] <Bloomberg> If I have 10 events it will see ugly, because will be outside of the box
[12:13:23] <Bloomberg> yes, that happen
[12:13:32] <Bloomberg> But I don't want that the box grow up.
[12:13:45] <grafi> im thinking maybe some css trickery could help you
[12:13:59] <jasonfisher> ezrios: http://api.jquery.com/category/Manipulation/
[12:14:03] <grafi> if the plugin doesnt have the ability to handle your problem
[12:14:03] <OnkelTem> $('<div><ul></ul></div>').append('li') -- this adds li to div, not ul. How to change this?
[12:14:19] <jasonfisher> ezrios: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[12:14:34] <jasonfisher> code there you can copy/paste basically
[12:16:00] <Bloomberg> I need some in jquery such as in css like this ::  style="text-overflow:ellipsis;"
[12:17:04] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: would you help again? :) Please see my last q
[12:18:10] <BillCriswell> OnkelTem: It wouldn't work like that. You would need to do like... $('<div><ul></ul></div>').find('ul').append('li'), but I'd definitely rethink your approach
[12:18:29] <grafi> Bloomberg http://jsfiddle.net/SDs2q/1/ something like that on the events class?
[12:18:51] <grafi> Bloomberg as you see everything but the first 3 <li> is hidden
[12:19:46] <OnkelTem> BillCriswell: I tried that actually, but it will return ul element, loosing div completely :)
[12:21:46] <shoky> OnkelTem:  just use vars..  e.g.   var ul = $('<ul>'); ul.append('<li>'); var div = $('<div>').append(ul); ... etc
[12:22:48] <Bloomberg> grafi: but what does the script that you show me
[12:23:08] <OnkelTem> shoky: I see, thanks.
[12:28:27] <ccmonster> on a change event of a select input, how do i get the text value?
[12:28:42] <ccmonster> not the value(), but the text that represents that value?
[12:29:47] <shoky> ccmonster: $(this).find('option:selected').text()
[12:30:13] <ccmonster> k
[12:30:15] <ccmonster> thanks shaky.
[12:40:39] <teamcoltra> I want to use $( "a" ).click() but only on links that are not on the same page (not to links starting with #) is this possible?
[12:40:46] <ccmonster> anyone able to help me parse this date from bootstrap-datetimepicker.
[12:40:54] <ccmonster> not sure how to handle the date after it's been selected.
[12:41:09] <ccmonster> jsfiddle teamcoltra
[12:41:38] <Mrgoose2> Hey im using jquery mobile and I have a slide panel.  I'm tryin to get a scrolling list working
[12:41:42] <Mrgoose2> doesn't seem to do anything
[12:41:46] <Mrgoose2> it wont scroll
[12:41:48] <teamcoltra> I don't really have anything to jsfiddle ccmonster
[12:42:33] <ccmonster> so you want to handle the click event on link1, but only for a link that is not the current page?
[12:43:14] <ccmonster> link.attr('href') != window.location.pathname;
[12:43:29] <ccmonster> just compare the two, and attach the event listener if NOT matched.
[12:43:44] <ccmonster> you could get more complex with breaking down the url more.
[12:43:57] <ccmonster> like $(location).attr('href');
[12:44:18] <ccmonster> which will give you path, query hash, etc.
[12:44:39] <ccmonster> does that work teamcoltra?
[12:44:57] <teamcoltra> ccmonster I jsfiddled the problem so you can see what I am doing right now http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/
[12:45:22] <ccmonster> ok, what's the current page?
[12:45:27] <ccmonster> in this example?
[12:45:38] <teamcoltra> nothing with # should trigger
[12:45:48] <ccmonster> so if # in the href, don't trigger?
[12:45:55] <teamcoltra> yeah
[12:45:56] <ccmonster> ok.
[12:47:42] <c4ptnh00k> any bootstrap gurus in here today. ##twitter-bootstrap is apparently taking a nap
[12:48:23] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/1/
[12:48:32] <ccmonster> i know bootstrap a lil bit.
[12:48:37] <ccmonster> teamcoltra: http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/1/
[12:49:39] <teamcoltra> ccmonster your code doesn't generate any alert for either
[12:49:53] <ccmonster> because I took the alert out. But what it does is go to your link.
[12:50:08] <ccmonster> it links where you want, and doesn't link where you don't want it.
[12:50:12] <ccmonster> what exactly do you need?
[12:50:36] <digitalice> hello!
[12:51:02] <teamcoltra> ccmonster the idea is that I am going to trigger a loading div so that when a person clicks a link on the site it will give a loading wheel
[12:51:04] <c4ptnh00k> i have a stack overflow question with everything in it   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18519451/twitter-bootstrap-responsive-navbar-dropdown-sub-links-are-unclickable-on-tablet
[12:51:18] <teamcoltra> but obviously I don't want to trigger the loading wheel when they are just scrolling down the same page
[12:52:41] <ccmonster> ok
[12:53:54] <ccmonster> teamcoltra: is this a better example of handling your scenarios? http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/2/
[12:55:07] <teamcoltra> ccmonster that is beautiful.
[12:55:09] <ccmonster> http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/3/
[12:57:35] <guest______> Hi i have an array and would like to know how to output all of its contents into a div tag. What i have now :      for (var i = 1; i < arrayName.length; i++) {     $("#array_output").append(arrayName[i].arrObject + '<br>');}
[12:58:55] <guest______> this how ever does not seem to work. Any ideas why?
[13:00:54] <NoiseEee> guest______: $('#array_output).html(arrayName.join('<br>'))
[13:01:04] <ccmonster> teamcoltra: http://jsfiddle.net/xPb9G/6/
[13:01:11] <ccmonster> there is two diff example of doing the same thing.
[13:02:28] <teamcoltra> ccmonster thanks, I am trying to learn javascript and jquery
[13:02:38] <ccmonster> i see.
[13:02:41] <teamcoltra> your code is well laid out
[13:02:45] <teamcoltra> and easy for me to folllow
[13:03:13] <ccmonster> well good.
[13:03:22] <ccmonster> just know that != -1 is saying whether or not the hash is there
[13:03:36] <ccmonster> if that check = -1, then it wasn't found, which means there was no hash.
[13:04:02] <ccmonster> that tells us it is an external page, and i think you want to do your loading piece there.
[13:04:05] <platzhirsch> How do you name functions that are only there to set up event handlers for certain elements?
[13:04:23] <ccmonster> otherwise, that check would return a number representing the index of the string where it found '#'
[13:04:45] <ccmonster> so #blah, it would = 0, foo# = 3, foo = -1
[13:05:03] <ccmonster> event listeners.
[13:05:10] <ccmonster> how doy ou name
[13:05:11] <ccmonster> ?
[13:05:23] <teamcoltra> ccmonster if I didn't care about handling the # could I just do if ($(this).attr('href').indexOf('#') == -1) {
[13:05:58] <ccmonster> that would only match on something that DID NOT have a has in it.
[13:06:22] <ccmonster> so yes, if you did that if condition, you would only handle items with NO hash
[13:07:14] <ccmonster> why do you ask platzhirsch
[13:07:30] <platzhirsch> ccmonster: I am curious what other people use as a name
[13:07:37] <ccmonster> oh
[13:07:48] <ccmonster> they are just event listeners, or event handlers.
[13:08:01] <teamcoltra> ccmonster but a href="/about/contact#name" would == 3?
[13:08:30] <teamcoltra> so maybe better to do != 0 instead of ==-1
[13:08:48] <teamcoltra> just making sure I follow properly
[13:08:50] <ccmonster> teamcoltra: no, it would return a number on that.
[13:09:36] <ccmonster> because "/about/contact#name" found a # at 14
[13:09:47] <ccmonster> so it would return 14 as the index.
[13:10:44] <teamcoltra> AH so it's looking for how many characters in the # is
[13:11:12] <ccmonster> it's counting through the string, or your href in this case, until it can or can't find '#'
[13:11:17] <ccmonster> it starts counting at -
[13:11:18] <ccmonster> 0
[13:11:26] <ccmonster> so foo# = 3
[13:11:31] <ccmonster> fo#=2
[13:11:39] <ccmonster> #foo = 0
[13:11:43] <ccmonster> make sense?
[13:11:52] <teamcoltra> Yeah and if it can't find anything then it's -1
[13:11:58] <ccmonster> exactly.
[13:13:13] <kashnikov> Hi
[13:13:14] <kashnikov> http://jsfiddle.net/6SHPb/
[13:13:27] <kashnikov> what am i doing wrong? I'm trying to loop through an array and fade in\out with the text
[13:13:55] <kashnikov> Any help would be appreciated :3
[13:18:02] <grafi> what are you trying to accomplish with that kashnikov ?
[13:18:29] <kashnikov> I'm trying to change the text of a element, and fade it in\out
[13:18:50] <ccmonster> make a function that takes an element and handles the fading in and out
[13:18:52] <ccmonster> along with a delay.
[13:19:06] <grafi> i dont think delay works how you want it to work
[13:19:12] <ccmonster> then separately iterate over the array, and pass the value to the function
[13:19:50] <kashnikov> im trying to get .each to work and that wont even work for me heh
[13:21:21] <kashnikov> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2771789/changing-text-periodically-in-a-span-from-an-array-with-jquery
[13:21:22] <kashnikov> cool
[13:21:47] <grafi> kashnikov http://jsfiddle.net/6SHPb/2/
[13:21:48] <balancee> hi, can i easily add a table into a accorden or does this result in a mess?
[13:24:13] <kashnikov> grafi: thank you
[13:24:26] <grafi> yw
[13:24:53] <ccmonster> you all good kashnikov?
[13:26:08] <ph88> what advantage can a drag and drop plugin offer me over the raw events like dragstart, dragend, drag, drop ?
[13:27:13] <darcyclarke> ph88 I'd ask yourself, what can any plugin offer you over native implementations?
[13:27:31] <ccmonster> just out of the box implementation.
[13:27:53] <grafi> "abstraction"
[13:27:56] <ph88> i don't know ... there are tons ... http://www.jquery4u.com/drag-and-drop/10-easy-jquery-drag-drop-plugins/  and jQuery UI draggable
[13:28:00] <darcyclarke> ph88 the answer is usually, some kind of consistent API for the different implementations per browser… so you don't have to think
[13:28:43] <ph88> i can't find any good websites with google which talks about drag and drop ... i like it to be fast
[13:29:46] <darcyclarke> ph88 http://html5doctor.com/native-drag-and-drop/ ???
[13:31:00] <ph88> so i should be using that now instead of all those plugins and libraries ? (it's ok for my project not to support old browsers)
[13:31:27] <ph88> maybe they were made before html5 DnD
[13:31:42] <ccmonster> minus the compatibility issues perhaps
[13:41:38] <jhoffmcd> is there a method to have a function fire on every event but the first in a slider?
[13:41:49] <jhoffmcd> say for an onChange event
[13:42:53] <grafi> set a flag maybe?
[13:45:08] <jhoffmcd> grafi: I suppose I could use a counter and another function?
[13:45:19] <ccmonster> anyone used bootstrap datetimepicker or know how to get access to the datetime in the format that is passed in?
[13:45:53] <ccmonster> set a var that is the counter, or use a class or something
[13:45:58] <ccmonster> and if hasClass, then do what you wanted
[13:46:05] <grafi> yup
[13:46:09] <ccmonster> that's what I would do.
[13:46:36] <ccmonster> set a class on first run if not there, then just keep checking for a class or data attribute and do your 'thang'
[13:48:19] <jhoffmcd> Ah makes sense, thanks!
[13:49:43] <grafi> good job everyone
[13:49:52] <ccmonster> lol
[13:58:50] <Bloomberg> join #codeigniter
[14:09:14] <grafi> boop
[14:09:43] <pixelpimp> poob
[14:09:44] <balancee> How can I show a user that a row in a table is clickable?
[14:09:48] <grafi> poop?
[14:10:15] <pixelpimp> have a paperclip pop up on the right side of the screen with a big popup with 20pt comic sans telling them
[14:10:29] <grafi> use <blink>
[14:10:30] <grafi> :D
[14:10:34] <pixelpimp> or cursor: pointer;
[14:10:37] <grafi> meh
[14:10:48] <balancee> isn't there a channel for such things?
[14:10:51] <pixelpimp> and a hover effect... and maybe something that looks like a button
[14:10:52] <grafi> what happening when I click the row?
[14:11:03] <grafi> we need more flat glossy
[14:11:04] <grafi> oô
[14:11:11] <grafi> glossy flat?
[14:11:15] <grafi> idk
[14:11:21] <pixelpimp> usually the glossy ones aren't flat looking
[14:11:30] <grafi> thatsthejoke.jpg
[14:11:37] <grafi> balancee [23:10:59] <grafi> what happening when I click the row?
[14:11:45] <pixelpimp> ^- very important question
[14:11:52] <pixelpimp> contextual clues über alles
[14:11:58] <grafi> richtig
[14:12:12] <pixelpimp> get into the user's mind; make them *want* to click that row
[14:12:15] <balancee> grafi a description window/layer opens or the table expands vertical. don't know yet
[14:12:49] <grafi> i would probably go with some :hover color and cursor: pointer
[14:13:06] <pixelpimp> you might google 'accordion menu' and see how a lot of those look
[14:13:22] <grafi> good idea
[14:13:24] <balancee> pixelpimp, It's fora task managment tool, not for a homepage. (coding one myself for expercice in a new framework) can imagen that the hover thing is annoying with the time.
[14:13:32] <balancee> it's already an accordon
[14:13:44] <pixelpimp> not sure i follow
[14:13:53] <balancee> wait, maybe I can make a demo
[14:13:58] <grafi> wohooo
[14:14:04] <pixelpimp> i'm just telling you if you're looking for a style, you might follow ones that have been done before
[14:20:22] <d0den> Is there a way to refactor this jquery so that one function could apply to both audio players?
[14:20:25] <d0den> http://pastebin.com/fi24qPkP
[14:20:48] <d0den> I am a complete novice so the answer may be very obvious
[14:21:38] <pixelpimp> have a function take in the name as a variable ('wavesglue' and 'rainglue', i suppose) and insert that where needed
[14:22:16] <pixelpimp> so $('#' + playerName + 'player').bind, etc
[14:22:33] <NoiseEee> and cache, man
[14:22:44] <NoiseEee> stop looking up the same thing over and over again
[14:23:10] <d0den> pixelpimp, thank you, I will work on that
[14:23:54] <balancee> http://jsfiddle.net/37JR7/ click on task one. The demo sucks but it does its job. How can I make the user aware that task 1 is clickable?
[14:24:10] <d0den> NoiseEee, I'm afraid I don't understand how caching would apply in this context. Can you point me towards something that might explain?
[14:24:59] <pixelpimp> balancee: if it's something like an info popup, an info icon would work
[14:25:06] <NoiseEee> d0den: var theThing = $('#whatever');  theThing.doStuff();  theThing.moreStuff();   vs  $('#whatever').doStuff(); $('#whatever').moreStuff();
[14:25:31] <NoiseEee> every time you use $(someSelector) it goes and reparses the doc to find the thing you care about; define it once, reference it.
[14:25:47] <balancee> pixelpimp mhm, maybe. Do you think it's better to have a second accordeon instead of a table and popup?
[14:26:05] <d0den> NoiseEee, thank you, that makes sense
[14:26:25] <NoiseEee> d0den: no prob
[14:26:33] <pixelpimp> balancee: i don't know your context, so it depends on the info being displayed.  If it's text like that, a popup makes more sense
[14:28:00] <quuxman> I'm having trouble with the frame messaging API, mostly in Chrome, but FF has similar behavior, but not as bad
[14:28:04] <balancee> pixelpimp it's for working tasks, like do that and that. mainly text
[14:28:16] <quuxman> the problem is postMessage has no effect until the frame is entirely loaded
[14:28:35] <quuxman> can anyone reproduce this?

[15:26:53] <RRR2> Hey guys would it be a good idea to add "\(literal newline)" to a string on JS, so it's readable?
[15:27:41] <balancee> Imagen you have a table, now you click on it. now it should close like a windo in mac into one corner and a titlebar is now there. Does jQUery have such animations?
[15:28:19] <jhoffmcd> im trying to use fadeTo() to fade background colors for a div, but its fading the whole div in and out, is there a better method to use?
[15:29:28] <RRR2> balancee: probably, don't know the name for it though
[15:30:41] <balancee> RRR2 ok, anyway, I'll build it myself if I rly can't find anything
[15:33:52] <pixelpimp> jhoffmcd: unfortunately, jquery doesn't handle colors very well without some outside help.  check out this plugin: http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/color-animation/
[15:35:15] <Tomashe> issue fixed
[15:37:31] <balancee> Do u use a css framework for application interfaces?
[15:44:41] <RRR2> Who?
[15:50:06] <utroda> Is there a better way to do this, var typeF = eval('this.'+type);
[15:52:14] <pixelpimp> var typeF = this[type];
[15:52:15] <jhoffmcd> pixelpimp: I have jquery UI, will that do it?
[15:52:26] <pixelpimp> not sure if it has color stuff
[15:52:32] <pixelpimp> lemme see
[15:52:43] <jhoffmcd> Something like this, but on a completion event instead of hover: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16559868/jquery-animate-change-background-color-on-mouse-over
[15:52:58] <pixelpimp> oh yeah, it does
[15:53:12] <pixelpimp> well alter it to fit your needs

[15:54:17] <utroda> pixelpimp: thx
[15:58:48] <jhoffmcd> eh still not working, all the examples are onClick or onHover, i just want it to animate during a timed event...
[15:59:40] <pixelpimp> the animation is the same
[16:06:48] <RRR2> Hey guys would it be a good idea to add "\(literal newline)" to a string on JS, so it's readable?
[16:08:02] <jhoffmcd> I was using wrong selector :/

[16:10:52] <Mrgoose2> Any of you use jquery mobile slide panels?  Is there a way to get htem to slide independently
[16:22:03] <JayWood> Has anyone had issues with trying to .append() after .empty()?  For the life of me I cannot figure out what's wrong.
[16:22:34] <RRR2> what is it wrong?
[16:22:35] <JayWood> That is, if anyone's alive in irc lol
[16:22:38] <JayWood> http://pastebin.ca/2440669
[16:22:40] <JayWood> Take a look.
[16:22:49] <JayWood> What it does is make a dropdown from an ajax response
[16:23:15] <JayWood> Then, once the select changes, it should re-post to the ajax, get new data, and change that
[16:23:33] <JayWood> But append isn't working.  I even console logged it
[16:23:53] <RRR2> So, you're making a dynamic dropdown..?
[16:24:08] <JayWood> Not the select itself, the data it creates should be dynamic
[16:24:13] <coldhead> JayWood: why not just .append(c); instead of append(function...)
[16:24:24] <JayWood> cuz I was console.log(html)
[16:24:27] <JayWood> just to see
[16:24:42] <JayWood> and append(c) still didn't show anything
[16:25:12] <JayWood> Like I said, the first select change, works fine, items come in from ajax call, just perfectly
[16:25:54] <JayWood> I think my logic is off, but I can't find it
[16:26:00] <JayWood> been fighting for about two hours lol
[16:26:53] <coldhead> does `c` have the right thing in it?
[16:27:04] <coldhead> if you do .append('TEST TEST TEST') does it work any better?
[16:27:14] <JayWood> Let me see
[16:28:07] <JayWood> Works fine, first time around, nothing second time
[16:28:20] <JayWood> emptys out the selector and well... nothing lol
[16:28:42] <coldhead> i suspect you are cloning IDs
[16:28:46] <coldhead> which is a bad idea
[16:28:53] <coldhead> because those things are supposed to be unique
[16:29:17] <JayWood> hmm
[16:31:03] <coldhead> a live demo would really help with the debugging if you can swing it, JayWood
[16:31:06] <JayWood> I realize that now... but would that actually affect append?
[16:31:23] <JayWood> umm lol give me  afew, it's a member based site, gotta remove security headers
[16:31:31] <JayWood> it's not live so no issues
[16:31:48] <coldhead> it would affect append if you're trying to append to the wrong thing
[16:31:54] <coldhead> it might be appending to somewhere you can't see
[16:32:33] <JayWood> http://bluelinereviews.com
[16:32:40] <JayWood> Select is the top right that says 'armor'
[16:33:32] <JayWood> The element group I'm cloning http://pastebin.ca/2440672
[16:33:58] <JayWood> does have some ID's in there, i'll change them to class references instead
[16:39:27] <JayWood> ok now it's not opening at all, lol I need a break...
[17:00:34] <Whirl3d> I have a function that I need to be able to pass two parameters. The first is either a string identifier, a jquery object, or an integer....the second is either a function or a function reference....what is the best way to make this happen?
[17:01:56] <Whirl3d> In other words, should I indentify the type of parameter passed in the first variable or should I just try each type in some order until I get a match?
[17:03:48] <Whirl3d> if (!a.is($) || $("."+a").length<=0||$("#"+a).length<=0||somelist.eq(a).length<=0) { return false;}
[17:06:06] <Whirl3d> var elem=a.is($)?a:$("."+a).length>0?$("."+a):$("#"+a).length>0?$("#"+a):somelist.eq(a).length>0?somelist.eq(a):undefined;   ?
[18:06:51] <Territoriojoven> hi
[18:08:30] <Territoriojoven> why is none of this working? http://prntscr.com/1o8555
[18:09:48] <Territoriojoven> uh, wait.
[18:10:38] <alexr2> can't have elements outside of the body
[18:12:04] <Territoriojoven> what?
[18:12:47] <Territoriojoven> so it's not syntax error?
[18:13:59] <tw2113> put #test 2 lines up
[18:14:27] <Territoriojoven> two?
[18:14:45] <tw2113> move it up two lines
[18:14:48] <tw2113> before </body>
[18:15:19] <Territoriojoven> oh shit
[18:15:24] <Territoriojoven> i just noted it was outside body
[18:15:28] <alexr2> Territoriojoven... You can't have elements outside of <body></body>... it needs to be inside of it
[18:15:46] <Territoriojoven> still not working lel.
[18:16:16] <alexr2> jsfiddle.net
[19:18:17] <Whirl3d> given an object var syns= {top::"top,tp,t,upper,ymin', btm:"btm, bottom, bt, b, lower, ymax"} and a function that accepts a string param...what is the best way to get the key from the syns object for param?
[19:19:45] <Xander1> i'm using bootstrap tabs in a modal that shows up - there's a form that's inside of that modal - but when switching from one tab to the next - it clears out all of the fields…any idea why? has anyone come across something like that before?
[19:19:46] <Whirl3d> so function (trm) { for (var key in syns) { if (syns[key].indexOf(trm)) return key});  ? or is there a better way?
[19:20:30] <Whirl3d> the form inside the modal has multiple tabs?
[19:20:30] <alexr2> you'd have to do indexOf(trm) >= 0
[19:20:44] <Xander1> yeah
[19:21:02] <Whirl3d> doesn't indexOf(trm) evaluate to -1  and therefore return false
[19:21:10] <alexr2> yes
[19:21:13] <alexr2> but so does 0
[19:21:22] <alexr2> even though it should be true
[19:21:38] <Whirl3d> great. If it starts with the term, I want it
[19:21:45] <Whirl3d> 0 returns false....
[19:21:47] <Whirl3d> oh..
[19:21:58] <Whirl3d> great. I appreciate the tip
[19:22:01] <alexr2> yep
[19:22:19] <alexr2> if you want to be more efficient, set up the array a little differently
[19:22:25] <fastak> hi
[19:22:26] <fastak> how can i check/discover a regex string for 'ger/bum\nasdasd'? (i want to select only 'bum', what got after /)
[19:22:29] <Whirl3d> please tell me how.
[19:22:37] <alexr2> have it be syns = {top: "top", tp: "top", t: "top... etc
[19:22:53] <alexr2> that way you can just check if syns[trm] !== undefined
[19:23:22] <alexr2> it's a single lookup that way instead of having to look through everything
[19:23:35] <Whirl3d> that's how I had it originally, then thought it was better this way. Thanks for the insight. Suppose it's not hard to create the alternate object programmatically.
[19:24:11] <alexr2> it's up to you, doesn't look like it'd be a huge array so unless you'll be accessing it thousands of times a second it's not gonna matter
[19:24:50] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I only have about 10 properties with synonyms. it shoudl be easy enough to do it your way.
[19:26:01] <alexr2> fastak, not quite sure what you mean... what are you trying to select?
[19:26:31] <alexr2> Xander1, jsfiddle.net
[19:26:48] <Xander1> @alexr2 yup, setting it up right now
[19:26:55] <Xander1> in progress
[19:26:56] <Whirl3d> so I am creating a function that you can pass an element an d it returns an object with the full dimensions of the element...then you can do $(elem).dims("lft") to get the left coordinate
[19:27:55] <Whirl3d> and I'm adding relative context so you could use $(elem).dims("midx",otherelem) and it would give you the middle x position of the element in terms of the "otherelem"
[19:29:37] <Whirl3d> but my ultimate goal is to be able to define a method to add to the dims object that returns a custom coordinate function...$(elem).dims({define:{"secretSpot", function () {return ....}});
[19:30:06] <Whirl3d> then $("elem").dims("secretSpot") would return the secretSpot.....Not sure how to approach that yet
[19:32:54] <alexr2> what are you unsure about?
[19:33:39] <Whirl3d> I can do it on the element level using the data attribute, but how do I setup a custom library to access the "secretPos" coordinates on any element?
[19:34:22] <Whirl3d> $.dims({define:{"secretPos":function () {}});
[19:34:28] <alexr2> just bind the function directly to the element
[19:34:34] <Whirl3d> then everything should be able to get the secret pos
[19:34:40] <alexr2> so $(selector).data("secretPos", function...)
[19:34:53] <Whirl3d> that works for an element.
[19:34:57] <Whirl3d> what about all elements
[19:35:04] <alexr2> $(*)
[19:35:34] <Whirl3d> I need a way to create a private library that functions can be added to/verified against
[19:36:00] <alexr2> bind it to body
[19:36:18] <Whirl3d> then even left, right, top, bottom, midx, etc. could all be defined using the same method
[19:36:21] <Whirl3d> brilliant.
[19:36:30] <Whirl3d> Don't know why I don't think of simple solutions like that.
[19:36:46] <alexr2> :-)
[19:37:10] <alexr2> or just a global variable, though i don't like doing that
[19:37:21] <alexr2> it essentially is a global variable at that point
[19:37:22] <Whirl3d> Eventually I will be able to move elements to line them up using these methods.
[19:37:59] <Whirl3d> I could say $("elema").alignTo("elemb", {src:"secretPos", dest:"upperLeft"});
[19:38:36] <Whirl3d> and it will align elema to elemb based on putting it's "secretPos" at the upperleft of elemb
[19:38:48] <Zak> if you don't care about javascript being disabled, is it reasonable to use ajax to submit login then set the session cookie manually through JS?
[19:39:23] <Whirl3d> $("elema").alignTo("elemb", {},{300, "easeOutBack"}); to animate the change in position
[19:40:04] <Whirl3d> {} uses each elements default alignment point or default: "midx,midy"
[19:40:42] <alexr2> Zak, it's less secure, but I don't see an issue with it outside of that
[19:59:04] <Whirl3d> how can I get the element by which the $.position() determines an element's position? It's not always the immediate parent....
[20:00:07] <Zak> alexr2: how would it be less secure?
[20:00:33] <alexr2> Zak, just in the sense that the network request stays with the browser
[20:02:28] <Zak> what do you mean? I'm proposing that instead of using a form to do the POST, I would just handcraft my own ajax request. (return a 302), then manually set the required cookie.
[20:03:01] <alexr2> Right, if you look at the network requests in a browser, you can see what data is being sent by POST
[20:03:06] <Zak> i'm assuming that most people like using the form because it enables people to login into sites without JS
[20:03:15] <alexr2> With a page reload, those usually get wiped away
[20:03:38] <alexr2> In certain cases, they don't, but more often then not, that data is gone once you change pages
[20:03:41] <Zak> alexr2: that's a bit of a trivial difference. you can always stop the network things being wiped away
[20:03:56] <alexr2> Right
[20:03:58] <Zak> as long as you're sending it over HTTPS, it's not plain-text
[20:04:04] <Zak> well
[20:04:17] <Zak> it's not easily intercepted in plain-text
[20:04:57] <alexr2> In the browser itself it's plain text though
[20:05:07] <Zak> yeah, in the POST request
[20:05:12] <alexr2> Correct
[20:05:30] <Zak> i guess lots of people like to redirect after login, because it means they can refresh content as though the user is authenticated
[20:05:57] <alexr2> It's all pretty trivial stuff
[20:06:05] <alexr2> You can refresh that content without the page reload
[20:06:10] <Zak> yeah
[20:06:18] <Zak> i'm just not a huge fan of refreshing the page
[20:06:23] <defaultro> hey guys, I would like my background to use series of jpeg file. However, how do I transition from first pic to the next then start over?
[20:06:24] <Zak> it can be expensive
[20:06:26] <alexr2> Single page apps are the wave of the future
[20:06:38] <Zak> alexr2: you think so?
[20:06:54] <Zak> i've often wondered that myself
[20:07:20] <alexr2> I guess not for everything, where it makes sense, yes
[20:07:42] <Zak> it makes a lot of stuff much easier, in some ways. e.g. SEO
[20:08:12] <alexr2> I don't know how much I really believe SEO nowadays
[20:08:27] <Zak> what makes you say that?
[20:09:47] <alexr2> Just a hunch, I've never really noticed that google ranks pages better or worse solely based on any techniques i've seen
[20:09:58] <alexr2> Only thing that does work is whether your content is good or not
[20:10:19] <Zak> yeah, fair call
[20:12:46] <alexr2> defaultro, try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8vHa2/86/
[20:12:53] <defaultro> cool
[20:14:24] <defaultro> looks like the background image link is bad
[20:14:59] <alexr2> works for me?
[20:15:09] <alexr2> what browser are you using?
[20:15:18] <defaultro> chrome
[20:15:28] <alexr2> hmm *shrug*
[20:15:36] <alexr2> feel free to replace it with any other images
[20:15:57] <alexr2> you understand this isn't exactly what you wanted, it's just an example of how to do image transitions, right
[20:16:10] <defaultro> yeah
[20:16:24] <defaultro> but not sure why the transition doesn't show in my chrome and firefox
[20:17:24] <defaultro> oh, i just read the code line by line. it's  a click event but i still had to fix the google image link
[20:17:37] <defaultro> i think I can use setInterval
[20:27:19] <alexr2> defaultro, use setTimeout inside of a function and have it call itself
[20:27:34] <alexr2> setInterval is bad news
[20:28:04] <defaultro> i actually found what I am looking for. I'm trying to read how the programmer wrote it, http://www.kingsizetheme.com/
[20:28:17] <defaultro> that's exactly how I want my background transition to be
[20:29:35] <defaultro> i think i found the code, it's the $.supersized ({ code
[20:29:46] <alexr2> supsersized plugin with supsersized.shutter plugin
[20:30:14] <defaultro> oh so it's a plugin?
[20:30:28] <alexr2> wow i can't spell
[20:30:31] <alexr2> supersized*
[20:30:33] <alexr2> yes
[20:30:34] <defaultro> <script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.kingsizetheme.com/wp-content/themes/kingsize/js/theme/supersized.shutter.min.js"></script>
[20:34:52] <Whirl3d> Here is why I hate jsfiddle the most. I will likely never use the flaming p.o.s. again. I just spent the last hour coding my coords method and couldn't see the top of the window to save it..
[20:35:10] <Whirl3d> So I clicked the taskbar, which opened my history in place of the fiddle.
[20:35:11] <tw2113> i prefer jsbin.com
[20:35:26] <Whirl3d> clicked back, and the content is all just jibberish
[20:35:45] <alexr2> That's pretty weird, I thought jsfiddle asked when you were leaving the page?
[20:35:49] <Whirl3d> b29yZD1mdW5jdGlvbiAoaXRtLCBwcm9wcywgY250eHQpIHsKICAgIGlmICghaXRtfHx  over and over
[20:36:12] <Whirl3d> not in this case for some reason. So frustrating
[20:36:17] <alexr2> that sucks
[20:36:23] <tw2113> still a good tool, all things considered
[20:37:00] <Whirl3d> Unless you want to use it. I swear I can never reach the "save" or "update" buttons. scroll once and the page is a wreck.
[20:37:34] <Whirl3d> You would think that someone working with jsfiddle would know a little css
[20:37:46] <digitalice> hi
[20:37:55] <digitalice> anyone awake?
[20:38:24] <alexr2> Sure digitalice

[20:39:52] <alexr2> No worries
[20:40:02] <tw2113> can't say i see that myself
[20:42:33] <digitalice> I re wrote a jQuery plugin to make it work with "span" instead of "li", but is not working as expected. My version starts with the whole list expanded. Can you guys help me? Original: http://jsfiddle.net/5VBZA/ My version: http://jsfiddle.net/e9WWc/
[20:43:52] <Whirl3d> I have two super-hi-res 37" monitors side by side. For some reason, the buttons disappear, then I can usually float the window to get them to reappar, but often I get that. bah...
[20:43:56] <digitalice> The original works as expected, but my version not ... :/
[20:45:11] <Whirl3d> I think it's because I have my type enlarged and some things get wonky...
[20:45:17] <alexr2> digitalice, line 38
[20:46:29] <digitalice> duhhh, I did't see it ... sorry
[20:46:36] <digitalice> stupid question ..
[20:46:40] <alexr2> Don't apologize, you're here for help
[20:46:49] <digitalice> thanks alexr2
[20:46:52] <alexr2> No problem
[20:48:20] <culh> I've an error somewhere in my syntax and all debug is telling me is 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <' @ jquery.min

[21:31:47] <JohnTerryCFC169> Feel free to join :)
[22:35:28] <xinming> Hi
[22:36:04] <xinming> Hi, Is there a way to in-place replace the tag totally to a piece of html fragment please?
[22:36:12] <xinming> I don't mean $('#id').html(blabla)
[22:36:24] <RRR2> .replaceChild
[22:36:29] <xinming> because the #id element is still there.
[22:36:58] <xinming> RRR2: When we use replaceChild, Is it ok if the new data is a html fragment?
[22:37:22] <RRR2> you mean a string as HTML?
[22:37:45] <RRR2> I think you have to use the dom object.
[22:40:05] <xinming> RRR2: Yes, I want the element to be replaced into html fragments which was retrieved remotely.
[22:40:50] <xinming> and the retrieved string may probably be text, or several nodes
[22:41:45] <RRR2> if jQuery use jQuery.fn.replaceWith
[22:42:02] <xinming> Now, What the idea I have is use document.write
[22:42:07] <RRR2> that is, jQuery("CSS selector").replaceWith
[22:42:11] <xinming> document.write()
[22:42:42] <RRR2> document.write may call document.open and that will probably break your page.
[22:44:21] <xinming> I use something like    var res = $.ajax({ url: '..', async: false });  document.write(res.responseText)
[22:44:34] <xinming> This worked as far as I tried.
[22:44:51] <xinming> But is there a better way to achieve the same thing I want please?
[22:45:05] <xinming> I don't feel my sollution is perfect, But don't know why
[22:45:18] <RRR2> well, document.write is discouraged for lot of reasons.
[22:45:26] <lenswipee> hi, i'm trying to capture the data attr on a drop menu. Do i place the data attr at the select tag or the option tag for jquery?
[22:47:19] <RRR2> xinming: http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/ Is this what you wanted..?
[22:47:23] <xinming> RRR2: hmm, What can I do to achieve the same thing in my case? Actually, What I want is where the <script> </script>  is placed, I can have the <script></script> to be replaced by a piece of html fragment totally.
[22:47:30] <xinming> Ok,  Let me check again.
[22:47:44] <RRR2> Wait, you want to execute JavaScript...?
[22:48:03] <camelCapsDay> I have a jqtpl that I'm wanting to print all the name/value pairs of a value (page.attributes), but its an object, so is there a way to use parseJSON in the template? like {{each page.attributes.parseJSON()}} ?
[22:48:08] <RRR2> External JavaScript?
[22:49:06] <RRR2> lenswipee: it really depends
[22:49:38] <lenswipee> hi, i'm trying to capture the data attr on a drop menu. Do i place the data attr at the select tag or the option tag for jquery?
[22:51:34] <xinming> lenswipee: It depends.
[22:51:50] <xinming> lenswipee: If each option has a different data, You please the data-* attr on each option.
[22:52:28] <xinming> If the drop down have single data, Then, Put it on the 'select' tag.
[22:52:31] <lenswipee> xinmin3
[22:52:45] <xinming> xinming: Let me give you what I met
[22:53:15] <lenswipee> xinming: just going to use one data value for the whole list
[22:53:47] <Whirl3d> then put the data attribute on the list, not the list elements
[22:53:49] <xinming> For example, I have each option with a short description label, When user change the option, We display the short desc. Then, I'll put this data-* on each option.
[22:55:30] <lenswipee> ok
[22:57:56] <xinming> RRR2: BTW, I just read the source about replaceWith, It seems, When we use replaceWith, jquery will parse the text into domNodes, and replace the node, Am I right?
[22:57:59] <Whirl3d> xinming, when you setup yuur ajax call, you pass a callback parameter to handle the data returned from Ajax. In that callback function, you replace the element you want with the content you just downloaded.
[22:58:28] <Whirl3d> you have to wrap the returned results in jquery, but sure..
[22:58:58] <RRR2> xinming: I guess you have to put your undommed string in the jQuery function
[22:59:42] <Whirl3d> $.ajax(url, function (data) { $("#oldelement").replaceWith($(data)); as long as you are loading a fragment. If not you have to grab the fragment from the loaded content like $(data).find("#theFragment);
[23:00:41] <xinming> Whirl3d: RRR2  I just tried, We It seems I don't need the  $(data)   , So, I suppose jquery internally does something like  $(data) before replace the node
[23:00:46] <xinming> and thanks, A bit clear now.
[23:01:14] <xinming> What function should I check that jquery turns string into dom?
[23:01:17] <RRR2> xinming: Well, that's nice, guess you don't need it then.
[23:01:34] <RRR2> xinming: what do you mean..?
[23:01:49] <Whirl3d> you can also use selectors to load portions of a document. $("#oldelement").load("http://dom.com/file.html #newElement")   the contents of #newElement will automatically replace #oldelement
[23:02:21] <xinming> the $(data) turns the html fragment into jquey object, So, I was thinking how jquery parse the text into DOM.
[23:02:42] <xinming> Whirl3d: Thanks, This was a really good trick
[23:03:46] <xinming> Whirl3d: I can remove something like $.get($('#old-element').data('ajax-url'), function (res) { $('#old-element').html(res) }
[23:04:14] <xinming> just $('#oldelement').load($('#oldelement').data('ajax-url')) is enough
[23:04:39] <Whirl3d> I personally prefer to load my content via ajax, format the content before adding it to the dom, then adding it
[23:04:59] <Whirl3d> .get
[23:05:06] <Whirl3d> where's the bot?
[23:05:17] <Whirl3d> ?.get
[23:05:36] <Whirl3d> drats. I can never remember the commands to get the bot to work.
[23:06:04] <xinming> Whirl3d: I write some remote action to return formatted html fragment which can be inserted directly.
[23:06:38] <xinming> but anyway, thanks for the .load method, I never knew about it
[23:07:19] <camelCapsDay> Trying to get an object printed in a template. Anything glaringly wrong? $.each(page.attributes, function(index, item){ var name; for(name in item){ document.write(name + " = " + item[name]); } });
[23:07:20] <xinming> Whirl3d: Do you have any idea how do we achieve the replaceWith method in jquery by using plain javascript?
[23:07:32] <Whirl3d> if you end up loading a piece of the html rather than the entire html, use a space between the selecctor in the url
[23:08:04] <Whirl3d> something.html .elementClass    will only load the elementClass portion of the retrieved html
[23:08:38] <Whirl3d> no idea. I would ask #javascript
[23:09:09] <RRR2> why not #DOM
[23:09:12] <xinming> Thanks
[23:09:19] <Cork> xinming: insert before and remove the old
[23:09:19] <xinming> I'll trouble both #channels
[23:09:28] <Cork> that is what replaceWith does
[23:09:36] <xinming> Cork: I understand this part
[23:09:40] <RRR2> #DOM does't exists, pity
[23:09:43] <Whirl3d> listen to Cork.   he knows MUCH more than me for sure
[23:09:53] <xinming> What I am curious is, How does jquery parse the html fragment into dom nodes.
[23:10:12] <Cork> xinming: if it's one element it uses createElement
[23:10:23] <Cork> if it is html segments it uses dom fragments
[23:10:47] <Cork> ?g mdn document fragment
[23:10:48] <b-ot> Cork: DocumentFragment - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment
[23:10:48] <xinming> Cork: I tried, that the replaceWith can work with aribitary fragments.
[23:11:08] <Cork> ?g mdn create document fragment
[23:11:09] <b-ot> Cork: document.createDocumentFragment - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.createDocumentFragment
[23:11:17] <xinming> Ah, Good
[23:11:19] <xinming> understand now.
[23:11:20] <Whirl3d> see how he makes the bot work for him....lol
[23:11:44] <xinming> But If I remember right, The DocumentFragment API wasn't there when I learn the DOM thing. :-)
[23:11:54] <Cork> xinming: true
[23:12:07] <Cork> xinming: and then more complex solution was needed
[23:12:21] <Cork> but it is what jquery does today
[23:12:24] <Whirl3d> camelCapsDay, when you say "trying to get an object printed in a template" what do you mean exactly?
[23:12:47] <xinming> thanks all for the good conversation.
[23:12:51] <xinming> Learnt a lot.
[23:12:56] <xinming> I'll go and read the doc :-)
[23:13:11] <defaultro> need your help folks, I couldn't figure out the code that moves the menu on the left up and down when you click on the arrow button? http://www.kingsizetheme.com/
[23:14:17] <Cork> defaultro: would be as simple as animate({ top })
[23:14:28] <Cork> and then just move the element out of the display
[23:14:33] <Cork> margin-top would also work
[23:14:34] <defaultro> ok
[23:14:46] <defaultro> i like the smooth movement going up
[23:15:02] <Cork> defaultro: you can do it with css3 too
[23:15:07] <Whirl3d> might be css transforms
[23:15:13] <Cork> and that will most likely give better performance
[23:15:32] <defaultro> ok
[23:15:38] <Cork> well more likely transition then transform
[23:16:10] <defaultro> i've almost spent an hour trying to figure it out but can't :(
[23:16:47] <Whirl3d> ugg. uses .live()
[23:17:31] <Whirl3d> adds class .menu_hidden or menu_visible
[23:17:59] <Whirl3d> then uses animate....line 94 of custom.js
[23:18:00] <Cork> so transition
[23:18:18] <Cork> or not :)
[23:18:20] <defaultro> oh, didn't se custom.js
[23:18:26] <defaultro> see
[23:19:10] <defaultro> looks like this is it
[23:19:12] <defaultro> $('#hide_menu a').hover( function(){
[23:19:13] <defaultro>          $('.menu_tooltip').stop().fadeTo('fast', 1);
[23:19:14] <defaultro> 		 $('.menu_tooltip').css('display', 'block');
[23:19:15] <defaultro>      },
[23:19:34] <camelCapsDay> Whirl3d: have a jqtmpl file that I'm wanting to include a list of all of the name/value pairs in an object (page.attr).          {{if page.attr}}{ $.each(page.attr, function(index, item){ var name; for(name in item){ document.write(name + " = " + item[name]); } } ) }{{else}}None{{/if}}
[23:19:38] <Whirl3d> that's just showing or hiding the tooltip
[23:20:03] <defaultro> yup, you're right
[23:20:35] <defaultro> i found it, $('#menu_wrap').animate({top: '-='+ hideHeight + 'px'}, "normal", function() {
[23:20:38] <defaultro> :)
[23:20:46] <Whirl3d> line 94
[23:21:04] <defaultro> yup
[23:22:26] <Whirl3d> camelCapsDay, if page is an object with an property called attr (that has properties), and jqtmpl require you to use document.write.....possibly ...but it doesn't look right to me
[23:22:46] <Whirl3d> never worked with jqtmpl files, so I am not sure.
[23:24:11] <defaultro> thanks Whirl3d , got it working
[23:24:27] <defaultro> how did you find custom.js so quickly?
[23:24:41] <defaultro> is it because you found the filename unique?
[23:25:08] <Whirl3d> It was the first js file in resources in chrome
[23:25:18] <Whirl3d> I did a search for Click
[23:25:25] <Whirl3d> it was the third result
[23:26:16] <defaultro> k
[23:26:58] <Whirl3d> if page.attr is an object, just use javascript to write it to a string then jquery to add it to the dom:   var str="" for (var prop in page.attr) {str+=prop+"="+page.attr[prop]}; $(document.body).append(str);
[23:27:40] <Cork> uh, what?
[23:28:10] <Whirl3d> *camelCaseDay
[23:28:24] <Cork> ah, template
[23:28:50] <Whirl3d> but like I said, I've never use jqtmpl before I don't know what it is exactly
[23:29:09] <Cork> it's an old templating plugin
[23:37:23] <doug65536> why don't I get mousemove events in this http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/LCFPD/1/
[23:38:18] <Cork> doug65536: cause you have no .test element inside a div
[23:38:35] <doug65536> so that selector must be a child?
[23:38:39] <Cork> yes
[23:38:51] <Cork> else it would make no point
[23:41:55] <doug65536> so what if I wanted mousemove events for .test but not for .child http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/LCFPD/3/
[23:42:42] <Cork> doug65536: so move .test to the selector
[23:42:45] <Cork> or remove it
[23:43:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/LCFPD/4/
[23:43:19] <Cork> ah not i get it
[23:43:20] <Cork> one min
[23:44:03] <Cork> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/LCFPD/7/
[23:44:43] <doug65536> ok cool. so it's not possible to use the selector parameter in on to express that. thanks!
[23:45:05] <Cork> doug65536: sure
[23:45:19] <Cork> doug65536: you can bind a selector to the child element and do stopPropagation()
[23:45:33] <Cork> doug65536: but the event will trigger on your element, so a selector won't help
[23:45:45] <Cork> as it will bubble
[23:48:20] <Whirl3d> do you mean $(".test").on("mousemove", ".child", function () {});
[23:48:55] <Cork> no
[23:48:58] <doug65536> Whirl3d: I mean, I wanted just .test, but not stuff that propagated
[23:49:14] <Whirl3d> I see.
[23:49:18] <Cork> and there is only two ways to do that, block the propagation, or filter the event
[23:49:40] <Whirl3d> I thought whe you said the selector paramter of on that you were referring to the "selector" paramter of on...
[23:49:46] <Whirl3d> but I see now
[23:50:24] <doug65536> Whirl3d: at first I did mean that, I tried putting ".test" as the selector parameter but it fails because that selector must be for a child
[23:51:03] <Cork> doug65536: it wouldn't have helped anyway
[23:51:56] <doug65536> Cork: yes, I don't completely understand the semantics of that selector parameter yet
[23:52:17] <Cork> doug65536: it is basically that you bind a selector on the $() element
[23:52:38] <Cork> and it when it triggers checks if $('selector').filter(event.target).length > 0
[23:52:58] <Whirl3d> you are watching for the event on that class from the context of your selected element $(watcher).on("click", "watcheeclass", function)
[23:54:17] <doug65536> Cork: but wouldn't $('.test').filter(event.target).length > 0   be true when mousing around in it?
[23:54:44] <Whirl3d> $(watcher).on("click", function (e) { if $(e.target).is(".watchee")) {do function()
[23:56:11] <doug65536> Cork: in other words, it seems to behave like $('.test').find('*').filter(event.target).length > 0
[23:57:14] <celtiore_> hi
[23:57:56] <Whirl3d> selector is the childclass in his example, doug65536, not the .test clas
[23:58:12] <celtiore_> how can we access to #jquery-mobile ?
[23:58:26] <WG1337> Hi! I have a table and one of rows has a long text. It messes up the whole table. Is there a nice plugin for jquery that would shorten text (like: random...) and when I hover over it, it shows full text (like: random text is in here) ?
[23:59:24] <doug65536> Whirl3d: what is confusing me is if it is like $('div').filter(event.target).length > 0, then why don't I get any events in http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/LCFPD/1/
