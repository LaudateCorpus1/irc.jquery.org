[10:04:37] <how2hack> hi, i've got a problem: it looks like $.getJSON().done() is not executing the last piece of code that's right after a $.each()
[10:04:51] <how2hack> is $.each() synchronous right?
[10:05:36] <how2hack> i've just put a console.log() inside the if that's right after the $.each and it is not getting executed sometimes when i refresh the page
[10:10:32] <how2hack> can this be a common error, or has this never happened before?
[10:13:16] <pavonia> .each() is synchronous
[10:13:39] <how2hack> i've just uploaded to a temp domain
[10:13:39] <Woet> how2hack: show your code
[10:13:50] <how2hack> auth.cryptor3.com/?demo
[10:14:40] <Woet> www.jsfiddle.net will do
[10:15:27] <how2hack> ok i'm gonna try to put it in there
[10:36:26] <khobo> https://jsfiddle.net/bwfgko28/
[10:36:35] <khobo> how come i can't create an onClick within the html
[10:36:43] <khobo> with a value of close()
[10:36:45] <khobo> using that code?
[10:36:47] <khobo> it doesnt fire when i do that
[10:51:46] <how2hack> Woet: looks like i can't reproduce it...
[11:00:32] <how2hack> Woet: do you mind looking at the code? maybe i'm missing something http://static.cryptor3.com/js/panel.js line 191
[11:19:06] <how2hack> anyone please?
[12:00:46] <how2hack> i've uploaded a video showing the problem https://youtu.be/Af_7OQT7PCU
[12:01:08] <how2hack> can that be considered expected behavior? or is there something wrong with my code?
[17:45:43] <a08g04h> should I use $.getJSON() or $.ajax() for getting json file from a remote server?
