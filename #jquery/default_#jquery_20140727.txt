[01:24:10] <Zitter> [$.ajax() ] hi, is it possible to create query string to add to $.ajax.url via beforeSend() method? Any example/hint on how  to do that?
[01:24:49] <damiano> hello
[01:26:07] <damiano> i am using this plugin https://github.com/localpcguy/Kalypto i would like to trigger a click EVENT on (around 20 checkboxes) i tried to use .click() but i do not think is the best solution (looping and .click() again and again)
[01:26:11] <damiano> other solutions?
[01:26:57] <damiano> if i set them as checked i do not see the "check" because this plugin create link so i must trigger click() event i think
[01:31:41] <Jattenalle> damiano, $('checkbox').click() ?
[01:31:56] <Jattenalle> use a common class on them all, so you can $('.someclass').click()
[01:32:03] <damiano> Jattenalle, tried! but there are around 20 checkboxes there...is not heavy?
[01:32:14] <Jattenalle> depends on how often you do it
[01:32:57] <damiano> what do you mean?
[01:33:00] <damiano> Jattenalle, i see Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[01:33:25] <Jattenalle> damiano, you have a recursive function somewhere, you're doing things wrong
[01:33:58] <damiano> Jattenalle, i simply did : http://pastebin.com/8xx9LsLB
[01:34:39] <Jattenalle> that should work just fine, if your HTML is ok
[01:37:21] <damiano> Jattenalle, yes its ok
[01:37:43] <Jattenalle> then something else in your code is wrong
[01:38:09] <damiano> Jattenalle, when i click on checkall i see RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[01:38:11] <damiano> it is strange
[01:38:23] <damiano> "send" 20 clicks does not seem to much
[01:38:24] <damiano> no?
[01:38:55] <Jattenalle> like i said, something else in your code is wrong
[01:39:22] <damiano> Jattenalle, the strange thing is seems that events still running
[01:39:27] <damiano> i see many output in console
[01:39:35] <damiano> with just one click on check all
[01:39:44] <damiano> i see the js still running
[01:39:50] <damiano> many errors on console
[01:39:55] <Jattenalle> like i said, something else in your code is wrong
[01:40:09] <Jattenalle> i cant help you if i dont know what you're doing
[01:40:17] <Jattenalle> jsfiddle it
[01:41:51] <damiano> Jattenalle, maybe find the problem
[01:43:22] <damiano_> back
[01:43:32] <damiano_> Jattenalle, maybe i have find the problem
[01:43:39] <damiano_> .toggle class does not exists in source doce
[01:43:40] <damiano_> code
[01:43:48] <damiano_> so maybe .click() trigger the error
[01:43:57] <damiano_> i saw that plugin add <a href>
[01:44:16] <damiano_> so how can i send the click event correctly?
[01:44:33] <Jattenalle> like i said, something else in your code is wrong
[01:44:34] <Jattenalle> i cant help you if i dont know what you're doing
[01:44:36] <Jattenalle> jsfiddle it
[01:46:19] <ethan1341> http://www.yelloistanbul.com/ can any 1 tell me what the correct way to code there navbar is notice how it appears and reappears
[01:51:57] <damiano_> Jattenalle, pvt
[01:52:03] <Jattenalle> ?
[01:55:10] <damiano_> Jattenalle, i wrote you in private
[01:55:22] <Jattenalle> oh, i dont get pm's, too many spambots
[01:55:24] <Jattenalle> just link it in here
[01:58:14] <damiano_> Jattenalle, one question before...what is the difference between .click() and .trigger('click')  ??
[01:58:56] <Jattenalle> you can pass data with trigger, i dont think you can with just .click
[01:59:17] <damiano_> ah ok
[02:20:09] <Guest_> I've made a terrible mistake, I think
[02:20:44] <Guest_> I assumed that there was a native google maps app for W8
[02:21:56] <Guest_> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Animation
[02:22:11] <Guest_> that page has horrible scrolling lag on Chrome
[02:22:27] <Guest_> ironic
[02:31:45] <sacho> huh? no it doesn't
[02:36:06] <Jattenalle> can confirm, no lag
[02:36:24] <Jattenalle> Guest_ probably tried to browse it using hardware acceleration on some intel GMA shit
[02:39:50] <Guest_> maybe my 25 frozen 'Google Chrome Helper' processes could be part of the problem
[02:41:53] <Guest_> okay. so it wasn't that
[02:42:18] <Guest_> I'm not on a GMA GPU (thank god)
[02:42:39] <Guest_> it's something discrete
[04:22:11] <Zitter> Does it work $.ajax({beforeSend: function(xhr, s){ s.data += "&name=foo&sur=bar";} }); in jQUery1.8.3? I'm asking because  query string is not sent
[04:29:25] <wahee> If anyone could spare a hand it would be greatly appreciated -> http://pastebin.com/496B5gJm
[04:49:30] <Jattenalle> Zitter, s.data ?
[04:50:32] <Jattenalle> are you sure it's a string?
[08:13:43] <marcaddeo> hey guys, i have a lead form that i'm submitting via ajax, and that's working fine.. but i need to put some conversion tracking codes in when the lead form is successfully submitted.. any idea how to do that? it's some <script>'s from facebook and bing that need to execute
[08:14:29] <marcaddeo> i tried using $.get to get the scripts from another file, and appending them.. but appending wont execute the <script> tags... i tried $.getScript but that didnt seem to work either
[08:16:30] <dmsuperman> marcaddeo: it would depend in the scripts themselves and how they expect to be loaded/executed
[08:16:45] <dmsuperman> if simply including them into the page isn't enough you'll have to figure out what it is those scripts expect you to do
[08:18:13] <marcaddeo> dmsuperman: well, they're basically <script> tags that track conversions to like.. bing and what not
[08:18:26] <marcaddeo> so it's just <script> tags that need to be executed
[08:18:32] <marcaddeo> but, only after a conversion happens
[08:20:50] <dmsuperman> well clearly not then right? because including the script tag into the page executes it
[08:21:04] <dmsuperman> and if whatever you expect to be happening isn't happening, then wouldn't you agree that it needs more than just execution?
[08:23:39] <dmsuperman> marcaddeo: here's what I would do. First copy the script tag right onto the page you are testing, make sure it fires successfully. If it does, then try including it on the page via $.getScript (right on the page, not attached to any AJAX functionality)
[08:53:27] <krambiorix> hi, i want to get the number of rows where minimum 1 input field exists... What am i doing wrong? $(this).closest('tbody').find('tr').filter(function(){return $(this).find('input').length > 0;}).length
[09:21:10] <northfurr> Uhhh
[09:22:59] <northfurr> jQuery noob here…. for some reason it’s wrapping my markup with extra html tags and doing all kinds of weird shit
[09:28:09] <northfurr> heh nvm, i’m silly
[09:28:18] <Jattenalle> you're welcome northfurr :)
[10:18:45] <k-g> Hey guys
[10:21:11] <k-g> Does anyone know a jquery script to embed a html5 video which displays a big centered play button and plays automatically in fullscreen onclick?
[11:37:20] <krambiorixx> hi, i want to get the number of rows where minimum 1 input field exists... What am i doing wrong? $(this).closest('tbody').find('tr').filter(function(){return $(this).find('input').length > 0;}).length
[12:22:57] <t432> I have the following line defined in the header section of the page "<meta content="4b1d22be-23b6-4a7c-940c-3eee98345d5d" name="_csrf">" , attribute content is subject to change on refresh, how do i get the content value from within a script?
[12:39:43] <dmsuperman> t432: jquery.attr
[12:40:39] <t432> <dmsuperman>: will this work? var csrfToken =$('meta[_csrf]').attr('content');
[12:43:13] <HowardwLo> hello! I need some help with salvattore and dynamic ajax content. I _think_ i need to call a function inside salvattore.js to reload it after ajax, but im not sure how
[12:43:19] <dmsuperman> t432: .attr('content') would work if you had the right selector
[12:43:32] <HowardwLo> this is salvattore http://salvattore.com/
[12:43:33] <dmsuperman> t432: Right now your selector is looking for any meta tag which has an attribute called "_csrf" though
[12:44:11] <dmsuperman> t432: you probably want meta[name=_csrf] since you're looking for the value of the *name* attribute, not the _csrf attribute
[12:44:53] <t432> there is only once
[12:44:53] <t432> ah
[12:45:35] <HowardwLo> what i’m trying to do is ajax in new masonry img content to replace the old ones (ajax page refresh) as opposed to the scrolling appending mechanism
[12:47:31] <HowardwLo> anybody? :)
[12:52:04] <walidvb_> sry got disconnected. anyone on that form focus problem? http://jsfiddle.net/45te3/
[12:55:41] <HowardwLo> how do I call this https://github.com/rnmp/salvattore/blob/master/dist/salvattore.js#L487 from another js file?
[12:59:33] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: it's not meant to be called from another file
[12:59:54] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: oh
[12:59:57] <walidvb_> this method belongs to the salvatore class
[13:00:24] <HowardwLo> theres no way to access it from another file?
[13:00:36] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: check the Dynamic Content section here: http://salvattore.com/
[13:00:48] <walidvb_> you don't want to do that
[13:00:54] <walidvb_> but yes, there is probbly a way
[13:01:08] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: isn’t that one for scrolling? or adding new content to the bottom of existing content?
[13:01:20] <walidvb_> it is. what is it you want to do?
[13:01:21] <HowardwLo> I’m ajaxing a new page entirely, and I need salvattore to reload
[13:01:44] <walidvb_> oh.
[13:02:59] <walidvb_> hm. are you adding content that has the data-columns attributes?
[13:05:13] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: yes, the items are all inside a data-columns attributed div
[13:05:29] <walidvb_> i'm surprised the plugin doesn't run again
[13:05:30] <HowardwLo> im actually replacing the whole container
[13:05:35] <walidvb_> do you have a live link?
[13:05:41] <HowardwLo> i do not, its all localhost
[13:09:17] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: you have a salvattore variable on your page?
[13:09:17] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: ya im really lost :/
[13:09:23] <walidvb_> try salvattore.init()
[13:10:01] <HowardwLo> nope, didnt get anyhting for salvattore.init()
[13:10:12] <HowardwLo> what do you mean by, do i ahve a salvattore variable on my page?
[13:10:17] <walidvb_> but salvattore does exist
[13:10:27] <HowardwLo> oops d/c
[13:10:36] <walidvb_> i mean that it's a variable to which you have access
[13:10:51] <HowardwLo> i do not
[13:12:43] <walidvb_> i'm not too sure
[13:13:13] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: how do i get the salvattore variable?
[13:13:27] <HowardwLo> var salvattore = (not sure what to put here)
[13:13:33] <walidvb_> i'm surprised it's not there, but i' still going through its code
[13:13:59] <walidvb_> no, the plugin should create a variable that will exist in window, that you can then call
[13:14:39] <HowardwLo> and that varible is salvattor?
[13:14:46] <walidvb_> yes
[13:14:50] <walidvb_> salvattore
[13:15:00] <HowardwLo> ah, i do see that variable
[13:15:06] <HowardwLo> looks like it has 3 functions
[13:15:11] <HowardwLo> append, prepend, and register grid
[13:15:41] <walidvb_> alright, so try salvatore.register_grid
[13:17:21] <HowardwLo> i get a, cannot read property ‘display’ of null
[13:17:55] <HowardwLo> https://github.com/rnmp/salvattore/blob/master/dist/salvattore.js#L469
[13:17:57] <HowardwLo> on that line
[13:17:57] <walidvb_> https://github.com/rnmp/salvattore/pull/78
[13:18:28] <walidvb_> right, cause the function requires a grid as argument
[13:19:10] <walidvb_> try to pass this as argument: document.querySelectorAll("[data-columns]")
[13:20:15] <HowardwLo> salvattore.register_grid(document.querySelectorAll("[data-columns]")); same error same line
[13:20:50] <HowardwLo> i’m inspecting element, i do see data-colums as an attribute (although empty) and the images are loaded within
[13:21:21] <Yatekii> Hey guys
[13:21:22] <walidvb_> document.querySelectorAll("[data-columns]") returns smth?
[13:21:43] <HowardwLo> yes it does
[13:21:58] <HowardwLo> put that into console, it returned the correct ul
[13:22:32] <HowardwLo> it doesnt matter if its a ul does it?
[13:24:42] <Yatekii> can someone help me: http://iglehm.ch/ the images at the right should be fading alternatingly. When you tab the page down and get it up after 20 secs, are all 3 images the same for you? Do you know why? becasue it is like that for me and I don't know why ... if you read the DOM Console log I do, you can see it gets a new picture the right way (images[counter] is logged correctly), but when it accesses it on line 9 of the script it somehow still r
[13:24:42] <Yatekii> efers to the old value of counter :S any ideas?
[13:28:59] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: i doubt it
[13:29:14] <walidvb_> i assume your original page also has a ul
[13:29:19] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: yes it does
[13:29:34] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: im actually ajaxing a page that is identicle to the original, just the content is different
[13:29:45] <walidvb_> weird. i'd open an issue, because it's not good design
[13:30:15] <HowardwLo> so im swapping the holders of that content
[13:30:15] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: its not? can you explain a bit more why its not ?
[13:30:20] <Yatekii> actually I feel like it executes the setTimeout() event just when I open the tab again, because it always put's the newest counter for all 3 pictures ... so as iff all 3 events are not exectued in th ebackground and when I tab it up they're executed with the curently chosen image ... :S
[13:30:36] <walidvb_> because it doesn't provide an API for you to call the init again
[13:31:14] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: is it easy to make one myself? don’t exactly have time to wait for them :(
[13:31:24] <walidvb_> go with masonry, then
[13:31:27] <walidvb_> :)
[13:31:45] <HowardwLo> masonry?
[13:32:03] <HowardwLo> https://github.com/Masonry/Masonry
[13:32:04] <HowardwLo> ?
[13:32:41] <walidvb_> yes
[13:32:59] <walidvb_> with that, you'll be able to call new_content.masonry
[13:33:17] <HowardwLo> is it a css masonry or js masonry?
[13:33:31] <HowardwLo> i choose salvattore because of css, i wanted it to load faster :O
[13:33:44] <walidvb_> js
[13:33:50] <walidvb_> salvattore also runs js
[13:34:20] <HowardwLo> but they use css to load the images?
[13:34:37] <HowardwLo> i was told it would be faster
[13:34:57] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: you're cnfusing me or you're confused
[13:35:06] <walidvb_> salvattore/masonry only deal with the layout
[13:35:35] <HowardwLo> probably im confused :)
[13:35:59] <walidvb_>  images are loaded one by one by your browser
[13:36:26] <frank_o> Anybody aware of a tool that can compare two JS libs to see if there are any conflicting namespaces etc.?
[13:36:29] <HowardwLo> i thougth salvattore delays the image load until it crosses what you see?
[13:36:30] <frank_o> Trying to figure out what it is about jquery.embedly.js that disables iscroll.js when emulating a touch screen device in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5YDjS/
[13:37:47] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: that'd be lazyload
[13:38:01] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: ah right, we have lazyload. im getting confused between the two
[13:38:05] <walidvb_> salvattore makes filled multiple columns layouts
[13:38:14] <walidvb_> masonry layouts, in fact
[13:38:56] <HowardwLo> well, short of switching to masonry, is there a way to hack salvattore to make it work for me?
[13:39:07] <walidvb_> more work imo
[13:39:28] <HowardwLo> i cant recall, but there was a reason why im not using masonry
[13:39:50] <frank_o> HowardwLo: was that reason packery?
[13:40:05] <walidvb_> you could simply rerun the whole plugin, that should work
[13:40:22] <walidvb_> try and copy-paste this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnmp/salvattore/master/dist/salvattore.js
[13:40:31] <walidvb_> in your console, that'd work, i guess
[13:41:07] <HowardwLo> frank_o: css was just more lightweight
[13:41:41] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: let me try that
[13:41:56] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: it's not css
[13:42:07] <HowardwLo> says its undefined, and no images pop up
[13:42:16] <walidvb_> i mean they both do the same
[13:42:24] <walidvb_> HowardwLo: again, images have no relation to that
[13:42:32] <walidvb_> how do you call lazyload() ?
[13:43:10] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: https://dpaste.de/XNw2 i call this on success
[13:44:22] <walidvb_> .size-1of3 doesn't exist yet, i suspect
[13:57:15] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: how do i call the plugin in the js?
[13:57:26] <HowardwLo> just, paste the code from that link?
[13:57:35] <HowardwLo> wait ya, its just js. :|
[13:59:18] <HowardwLo> walidvb_: horray it works
[13:59:26] <HowardwLo> i put the whole plugin inside a function and call it before lzyload
[14:03:01] <HowardwLo> well…now theres a bunch of plugins running at the same time i think
[14:03:04] <HowardwLo> and its laggy :(
[14:06:29] <iamviknesh1> why does the text on the list dont show up http://jsfiddle.net/2EK2e/
[14:06:43] <iamviknesh1> however it shows on my machine
[14:26:10] <iamviknesh1> anyone here to help ??
[14:26:33] <andi98_> what's your problem?
[14:31:27] <iamviknesh1> andi98_: i actually have a another problem , but list name dont show up in jsfiddle , however it works on my machine

[14:59:25] <Yatekii> can someone help me: http://iglehm.ch/ the images at the right should be fading alternatingly. When you tab the page down and get it up after 20 secs, are all 3 images the same for you? Do you know why? because it is like that for me and I don't know why ... if you read the DOM Console log I do, you can see it counts up the right way (counter and images[counter] is logged correctly), but it feels like line 9 is executed delayed, because it takes
[14:59:25] <Yatekii> the last counter value for all 3 pictures, so the setTimeout is executed properly but the line 9 somehow just when I tab up again :S
[15:01:35] <RizziCR> Yatekii: ich habe immer unterschiedliche Bilder, egal wie ich die Seiten durch wechsel
[15:03:10] <Yatekii> du musst es ein paar sekunden im hintergrund haben
[15:03:13] <Yatekii> also so 20 oder so
[15:03:21] <Yatekii> dann auch?
[15:03:45] <Yatekii> sieht dann so aus: http://noah.wapple.ch/screens/Screen%20Shot%202014-07-27%20at%2022.23.09.png
[15:04:17] <RizziCR> ah ok.. ja das ist bei mir auch so..
[15:04:38] <RizziCR> wenn ich die seite „in den hintergrund“ packe
[15:05:10] <Yatekii> er zählt aber korrekt, bloss das aktualisieren ist dann echt auf das "foreground" event des fensters zeitlich ausgelegt
[15:07:59] <RizziCR> hmm..
[15:13:22] <_r0m3> hey, guys, is there any way to have a $( 'body' ).trigger and exclude only one div?
[15:13:46] <_r0m3> i'm trying to target everything but one div
[15:14:10] <RizziCR> you have to check with an if inside the event handler for this div
[15:14:47] <_r0m3> ahh, okay -- any example, bud?
[15:14:49] <RizziCR> or with .not(‚div#divtoignore‘)
[15:14:57] <Yatekii> hardcode for everything but the div! :P
[15:15:17] <_r0m3> lol
[15:15:28] <_r0m3> thanks btw, guys
[15:16:09] <_r0m3> setting a condition sounds perfect, just not sure how
[15:16:30] <RizziCR> your event handler get the event as parameter
[15:17:08] <Yatekii> check for the sender I guess :)
[15:17:11] <RizziCR> and the event object has the target which the event triggers.. check that
[16:51:45] <inDux> "Uncaught Type Error: Undefined is not a function" with a timepicker, has anyone seen this before?
[16:52:35] <inDux> I've already made sure that there's only 1 ref to jquery, it's the right version, and the functions called onload
[16:55:19] <sammych1> this one's a little annoying: when there's text inside an input, it shifts down due to an alignment issue. Probably something to do with the display:table/cell? http://jsfiddle.net/7qz5t/
[17:49:31] <jimi_> I am submitting a form using ajax and serialize. how can i incorporate form file inputs also into 1 post?
[17:50:47] <systemfault> jimi_: You can’t unless you don’t need to support anything but the most recent browsers.
[17:51:23] <systemfault> jimi_: For older browsers, you can use the hidden iframe trick
[17:51:35] <jimi_> systemfault, What about bleeding edge browsers?
[17:52:01] <systemfault> jimi_: It’s easy with them, you just need to use the FormData object and XHR2
[17:52:09] <jimi_> systemfault, ty, ill look at that
[17:52:26] <jimi_> im showing a preview of the image already, was thinkingi  could always grab the binary of it and pass it and re-create it on the other side
[17:52:30] <systemfault> You even get upload progress notifications if you want them
[17:53:26] <jimi_> systemfault, using FormData?
[17:53:42] <systemfault> formdata and xhr2, yes.
[17:55:47] <jimi_> systemfault, looking into it now ty
[17:55:58] <jimi_> systemfault, its for safari ios browser , checking to see if it support sit
[17:56:44] <systemfault> Looks like it (From caniuse.com)
[17:57:10] <systemfault> (If you didn’t know about http://caniuse.com then now, you do)
[17:57:24] <jimi_> ty sir :)
[17:57:54] <jimi_> systemfault, would allow me to re-write a loto f this nasty code these guys have written. They create a new user in this order..... upload the image for the profile to a tmp table... then after post... and creation, do physicial upload move on filesystem, some database updates to sync to new location , update user tale etc etc.... trying to make this more fluid
[17:58:45] <systemfault> Cool :)
[17:59:29] <systemfault> The old way of doing async form transfers with files was with hidden iframes… It was awful.
[18:23:37] <jimi_> systemfault, it seems that if the form action attribute isn't set, the ajax won't send to the url defined in the url param
[18:28:54] <systemfault> ?
[18:32:27] <jimi_> systemfault, nm... i forgot to save... although my $_POST $_REQUEST and $_FILES are all coming empty
[18:33:44] <systemfault> show me the code

[18:34:44] <jimi_> systemfault,  ^
[18:35:40] <systemfault> jquery objects are not dom nodes
[18:35:56] <systemfault> FormData doesn’t care about jquery
[18:36:23] <systemfault> var formData = new FormData($('#addPatient’)[0]);
[18:36:29] <timgauthier> ...
[18:37:07] <systemfault> jimi_: the [0] unwraps the jq object
[18:37:16] <jimi_> systemfault, ah true, shit, didnt think about that
[18:37:59] <jimi_> systemfault, thanks again, you the man :)
[18:38:14] <systemfault> You’re welcome
[18:39:46] <jimi_> systemfault, seriously... you have no idea how much work you saved me RE: formdata, and not having to do this in four-thousand steps :P
[18:40:02] <systemfault> Haha, glad I could help
[20:24:24] <cmosguy> hi all, is there a jquery function that I can use to look at all the objects keys and find out of the value is null?

[20:50:51] <rahuldroy_work> what is the best jquery live search plugin that can handle spaces
[21:24:23] <user1> Hi. im trying to use a selector to select all <script> tags on the page. using something like $("script").contents(); works for most script tags. but it seems to fail when <script type="text/javascript"> is used
[21:24:27] <user1> any ideas?
[21:25:38] <rahuldroy_work> user1: have you tried $("script type=text/javascript")
[21:26:39] <user1> i havent. i will give that a shot. i was kinda hoping for a sollution that would work for both as it seems sometimes it one and sometimes the other
[21:28:05] <user1> rahuldroy_work: that doesnt seem to work
[21:28:56] <rahuldroy_work> hmm out of ideas then :(
[21:29:20] <user1> rahuldroy_work: thanks anyways :)
[21:33:17] <garylabronz> how come i loose the <p></p> when i do this
[21:33:23] <garylabronz>  console.log($("<p>test</p>").text())
[21:33:30] <garylabronz> or using html()
[22:02:34] <cjwelborn> text() gives you the text inside the tag. html() gives you the html nested inside of the tag (there is none here)
[22:03:26] <cjwelborn> try '<div><p>test</p></div>'
[22:14:32] <Keavon> Click the search bar and hit Escape https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/39034206/Trackbox/index.html
[22:14:45] <Keavon> It's supposed to replace the text with "test"
[22:14:48] <Keavon> In Firefox, it does not
[22:15:00] <Keavon> Here is the snippet of my code http://pastebin.com/KULVKve3
