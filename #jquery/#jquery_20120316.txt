[00:03:37] <Cork> nights``: you just need to overide the tab css
[00:22:15] <VioByte> Anyone know of a way to stack images in a div in a way such as the icons showen in a windows window.
[00:22:47] <VioByte> not sure what html tag,css,jquery method to use to do that.
[00:23:15] <scr3am> ???
[00:23:20] <mindis|wurk> uh, you mean how windows displays thumbnails when browsing images?
[00:23:28] <VioByte> yea.
[00:23:46] <mindis|wurk> i've usually solved it with just css using display: inline-block;
[00:24:20] <VioByte> hmm.. ok i'll try that.
[00:24:21] <VioByte> thx
[00:39:32] <nights``> hi
[00:39:34] <nights``> i want to change my jquery UI tab component to be layout according to this image
[00:39:37] <nights``> http://i43.tinypic.com/33yrokm.png
[00:39:41] <nights``> left side is current state, right side is after changing
[00:39:43] <nights``> anyone know how to do it? :)
[00:43:54] <tetradon> I'm trying to locate an element with a classname. I'm using $(this).parent().find('.classname');
[00:44:16] <tetradon> but I'm getting an empty dom element back
[00:45:07] <nights``> find only works on the body tag i think
[00:45:20] <nights``> so if your object isnt a direct decendent of the body tag
[00:45:22] <nights``> it wont get found
[00:45:26] <nights``> instead you should use
[00:45:32] <tetradon> .closest?
[00:46:18] <tetradon> The class is a child of a child inside the parent
[00:47:48] <nights``> hm yeah maybe closest
[00:48:02] <nights``> sorry im not sure, but find only works on objects directly under body i think
[00:48:16] <nights``> i remember having this issue a while ago
[00:48:43] <nights``> but i ended up using just filter
[00:48:55] <nights``> probably you wont be able to though
[00:52:39] <tetradon> .find should work actually but it doesn't
[00:53:26] <tetradon> according to jquery api documentation, .find() traverses down multiple levels which is what I would need
[00:53:37] <raj> can I put .done() on $.post()?
[00:54:06] <Cork> think so, haven't tried though
[00:54:29] <tetradon> I'll post what I have on jsfiddle
[00:55:01] <Cork> raj: just checked the code, yes it should work
[00:55:17] <Cork> raj: the wrapper returns the response from $.ajax
[00:55:27] <Cork> ?src jQuery.each( [ "get", "post" ], function( i, method ) {
[00:55:28] <bot-t> Line#6944 - "jQuery.each( [ "get", "post" ], function( i, method ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#6944
[00:56:40] <nights``> tetradon: really?
[00:57:35] <Cork> tetradon: .find find everything thats a child in the tree below the current element yes
[01:00:36] <aaairc> if i have a xhhml element... specifically.... <fb:like href= … > … </fb:like>
[01:00:51] <aaairc> should jquery be able to select it with $('fb-like')
[01:00:55] <aaairc> ?
[01:00:58] <blackspotwiggins> no
[01:01:20] <blackspotwiggins> if you have element <body>, should you be able to select it with $("b0dy") ?
[01:01:55] <aaairc> ok i was typing fast... i mean $('fb:like')
[01:02:41] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: ^
[01:02:51] <aaairc> for some reason that isn't working for me
[01:03:00] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, you need to escape :
[01:03:27] <aaairc> so it would be $('fb\:like')?
[01:03:38] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: ^
[01:04:07] <blackspotwiggins> ?tias
[01:04:07] <bot-t> Try It And See
[01:04:58] <tetradon> Okay here's my script: http://jsfiddle.net/EA3LQ/2/
[01:05:36] <tetradon> I want to change to text of an element but first I have to find the correct element with the specified class name, however, it's not finding it
[01:07:10] <tetradon> let the hate begin...I'm thinking someone is going to say my jquery code is ugly lol
[01:07:17] <Cork> tetradon: class like_4 isn't a child
[01:07:30] <Cork> its a child of a parent sibling
[01:08:07] <tetradon> right
[01:08:27] <Cork> tetradon: $(this).closest('.comment-container').find('.' + _this_id);
[01:09:37] <aaairc> blackspotwiggins: i don't know it doesn't seem to be working for me. it says [object object], and when i try and get the href off the fb:like element using $('fb:like').attr('href')   it says undefined.
[01:11:40] <Cork> aaairc: your not escaping again
[01:11:44] <tetradon> Thanks, Cork. That did the trick.
[01:12:04] <aaairc> i mistyped... i'm actually doing $('fb\:like').attr('href')
[01:12:23] <Cork> what does $('fb\:like').length show you?
[01:13:46] <aaairc> 0
[01:13:57] <Cork> so it doens't match
[01:14:00] <blackspotwiggins> aaairc, jquery always returns an objeect
[01:14:28] <Cork> ever worked with namespaces in jquery my self so can't really help
[01:14:31] <aaairc> ok so i can't use jquery then to select the <fb:like ....> element?
[01:14:47] <aaairc> k
[01:14:58] <Cork> aaairc: what you you get if you just select $('fb')?
[01:15:07] <aaairc> le me try
[01:15:08] <aaairc> one sec
[01:15:10] <blackspotwiggins> "fb\\:like" does not work?
[01:15:14] <blackspotwiggins> lrn2escape
[01:15:30] <aaairc> still zero
[01:15:32] <blackspotwiggins> or select by id
[01:15:45] <Cork> ah, true you need two
[01:15:55] <blackspotwiggins> there are literally dozens of ways to accomplish this
[01:15:55] <Cork> one won't ever do anything for the selector
[01:16:02] <tetradon> how would I replace the text inside of a span element?
[01:16:08] <blackspotwiggins> ?text @ tetradon
[01:16:09] <bot-t> tetradon, .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[01:16:10] <tetradon> I tried .html and .text
[01:16:21] <Cork> tetradon: it is the way
[01:16:37] <tetradon> okay, I must be screwing something up then. thanks
[01:17:01] <g0rd0n> good morning!
[01:20:15] <tetradon> yeah I was trying to set the text with an undefined variable being returned because I forgot to set the dataType to json, lol
[01:20:45] <tetradon> alright, bedtime
[01:20:48] <tetradon> later
[01:22:46] <Haraldson> Hi gang
[01:23:23] <Haraldson> Do you know of any easy way to animate font-size and have the element's children inherit the size when doing that animation?
[01:23:47] <Haraldson> I wanted to go with an "animate parent font-size" approach, but then the font just jumps
[01:24:19] <Cork> Haraldson: children should normally inherit font sizes
[01:24:34] <Cork> unless you explicitly set the fontsize on them and its in px
[01:26:58] <Haraldson> I've tried % and ems
[01:27:16] <Cork> em should work fine
[01:27:30] <Cork> not sure about %
[01:27:32] <Haraldson> but it just skips the animation :)
[01:28:54] <Haraldson> for instance I animate the parent font-size from 1em to 2em
[01:29:05] <Haraldson> the children elements have font-sizes given in ems, too
[01:30:02] <Cork> Haraldson: http://jsfiddle.net/DXrwG/
[01:30:36] <VioByte> http://pastebin.com/1aP3K92v any suggestions? just a var appending to a div
[01:30:52] <Haraldson> can't use pixels. IE doesn't play nice with pixels+ems, I seem to remember?
[01:31:02] <Haraldson> it's better than nothing, though
[01:31:15] <Cork> px doesn't inherit
[01:31:29] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/DXrwG/1/
[01:31:37] <VioByte> oops
[01:32:23] <Haraldson> hehe, if only this would work for me too!
[01:32:23] <VioByte> nevermind.
[01:32:26] <Cork> Haraldson: but ya, you don't want to mix em and px
[01:32:32] <VioByte> found my issue....
[01:32:36] * VioByte slaps self in face
[01:32:45] <Cork> Haraldson: but as you see em works well too
[01:33:00] <Cork> Haraldson: can you reproduce your problem in jsfiddle?
[01:33:53] <Haraldson> it's a tad over the top for a fiddle, and I can't share the work in progress :/
[01:34:18] <Haraldson> I'm making a rotation where items grow and come toward you, from right to left
[01:34:26] <Haraldson> probably been done hundred times before
[01:34:57] <eduardomart> is there a way to get a value of true if an element is "visible" ?
[01:35:08] <eduardomart> I am using the .fadeIn() fn
[01:35:16] <Cork> ?:visible
[01:35:17] <bot-t> :visible: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[01:35:18] <Haraldson> $(element).is(':visible')
[01:35:19] <Cork> ?.is
[01:35:19] <bot-t> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[01:35:31] <eduardomart> thanks Haraldson!
[01:59:51] <Stuffness> Question about making a plugin - I find that the code in my new method executes even if there is no matching element (e.g. ('.none').myPlugin() )
[02:00:23] <Stuffness> what's the best practice way to make it only execute if there is a matching element - should I wrap everything in if this.length > 0  ?
[02:00:51] <xec> Stuffness: i usually loop through the collection with each, that way it loops 0 times with 0 elements
[02:01:17] <xec> Stuffness: and you can attach it multiple times with a single call
[02:01:46] <Stuffness> that makes sense too, but for my particular one I'm doing the looping inside other internal methods
[02:02:34] <Stuffness> wrapping inside if this.length > 0 seems to work, was wondering if there was anything else people used. what you said about each definitely makes sense too though
[02:03:01] <Cork> Stuffness: normally ppl don't loop later in the plugin so its not a problem
[02:03:26] <Cork> and this.length is the simplest and fastest way to do it
[02:03:34] <Stuffness> cool, thanks
[02:04:12] <Stuffness> in my case I'm not looping in the main method because I start a setinterval in it, and I just want to have 1 timer for all elements
[02:05:06] <xec> Stuffness: show us your code, maybe someone can give more specific input
[02:06:35] <Stuffness> alright, but I pretty much got my answer :)
[02:06:38] <Stuffness> here it is https://gist.github.com/2049232
[02:06:47] <Stuffness> it's for a countdown timer
[02:07:28] <xec> this is coffeescript?
[02:07:31] <Stuffness> yes
[02:07:44] <Someus> Hello Guys! How can i put two dialogs in one page?
[02:07:46] <xec> ok, just not too familiar with the syntax
[02:08:14] <Stuffness> actually maybe I do have one question.. notice how I have to initiate the setInterval with 'window.$timerElements.timerTick()'
[02:08:22] <Stuffness> is there a more proper way to do this without setting a window variable
[02:08:59] <Stuffness> I tried just passing this.timerTick(), 'this.timerTick()', this.timerTick, etc
[02:09:43] <nights``> hi
[02:09:43] <nights``> i want to change my jquery UI tab component to be layout according to this image
[02:09:43] <nights``> http://i43.tinypic.com/33yrokm.png
[02:09:43] <nights``> left side is current state, right side is after changing
[02:09:43] <nights``> anyone know how to do it? :)
[02:12:20] <Haraldson> Cork: Strange, my implementation works fine in Fx, and your fiddle works in both Chrome and Fx
[02:14:39] <Haraldson> could be because an inner element containing the text, has its width given in %
[02:27:01] <Gerardt> good morning all
[02:27:51] <Gerardt> Can anyone explain me how i target the 'value' of a image using jquery? So far i have $(".fotoThumbnail").val();
[02:28:01] <Gerardt> but this isnt working
[02:28:17] <Cork> images doens't have value
[02:28:25] <Cork> your after the src?
[02:28:34] <Cork> attr('src')
[02:29:47] <Gerardt> well i want to give each image an unique id so if i click it i can show it big on the next page
[02:30:19] <Cork> so you after the id and not value?
[02:30:20] <Gerardt> so i want to give each image something (gonna generate the images using PHP) so when someone clicks it i can tell the database what image was clicked
[02:30:24] <Cork> ?_?
[02:30:25] <bot-t> Cork, #9746 (domManip incorrectly adds "?_=NNNN" to passed <script>s ... - Opened 7 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9746
[02:30:58] <Cork> sounds like you want data-something rather then anything else
[02:30:59] <mindis|wurk> you're not storing images in a database are you?
[02:31:07] <Cork> ugg..
[02:31:14] <Cork> hope not... >_>
[02:31:21] <Gerardt> no no
[02:31:25] <Gerardt> just paths
[02:31:31] <kevindougans> hey guys, i'm making a responsive website and i was wondering whats the best way to run specific query on a page depending on which screen size is currently being viewed?
[02:31:46] <kevindougans> i'm using the html5 boilerplate so i'm sure theres something built in but i just don't know it
[02:31:53] <Cork> Gerardt: set a data-dbid or if the image is uniq on the page the id attribute
[02:32:16] <Gerardt> do you know how i can target the id?
[02:32:27] <Cork> kevindougans: @media
[02:32:30] <Cork> css
[02:32:44] <Gerardt> okay cork thanks
[02:32:49] <Cork> Gerardt: first you have to deside how you store it on the element
[02:33:23] <Gerardt> is it possible when you target a class + using 'this' to find out the ID?
[02:33:27] <kevindougans> Cork: i have my responsive sheets in place with the @media but now i need to run different query scripts depending on which media is being used
[02:34:13] <kevindougans> media queries will only effect stylesheets, not javascript
[02:34:15] <Cork> kevindougans: js can check media values too if i remember correctly
[02:34:29] <kevindougans> ok i'll google that cheers
[02:34:48] <Cork> http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/newtech3.shtml
[02:36:46] <kevindougans> thanks Cork
[02:37:27] <Gerardt> Cork, sorry for bothering you again, but can you find out the ID of a div you target using a class?
[02:37:53] <nFFF> I understand the difference of: function foo(){},  var foo = function(){}, and var foo = function bar(){} , but not which one is preferred, in actual use/design cases where you'd _need_ to use one over the other
[02:38:14] <Cork> Gerardt: sure, or you can select on the id directly
[02:38:20] <soulraven> anyone work with dataTables plugin?
[02:38:36] <soulraven> i try put some buttons inside dataTables using sDOM
[02:38:43] <Gerardt> sec i'll js fiddle what i mean
[02:38:50] <quicksilver> Gerardt: you can get a jquery Object's id with .attr('id')
[02:38:56] <soulraven> but i don't know verry well how
[02:38:59] <quicksilver> Gerardt: and you can get a DOM objects id with .id
[02:39:02] <luffha> hi guys
[02:39:18] <Gerardt> okay thanks
[02:39:21] <Gerardt> gonna test that
[02:39:22] <luffha> how do i add a new <td> but right after the first one?
[02:39:33] <Trisox> ?after
[02:39:35] <Cork> nFFF: if you need to conditionally create a function, or if you don't use it in the scope you create it, you want the second alternative
[02:39:40] <Trisox> ? after
[02:39:58] <Cork> nFFF: if you want the function to be parsed before the scops code runs you want the statement
[02:40:25] <Cork> sorry defenition
[02:40:46] <Trisox> $('td').first().prepend('<td>Test</td>');
[02:40:58] <Gerardt> quicksilver: Cork thanks both!!!111
[02:41:16] <Gerardt> $(this,".fotoThumbnail").attr('id'); works
[02:41:29] <Cork> Trisox: after is what you want
[02:41:51] <luffha> thanks Trisox
[02:41:59] <Trisox> ? after()
[02:42:00] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[02:42:07] <Cork> prepend will add it to the first td
[02:42:08] <Trisox> ah i did that but bot didnt respond
[02:42:47] <luffha> thanks  bottie :D
[02:42:50] <Xotix> If i have a button with onClick="foo()"; can i somehow attach .click() to the same button and trigger function x() before foo()?
[02:42:52] <nFFF> Cork, I understand that, just don't understand when you'd _need_ to use one over the toher, in a real example
[02:42:59] <nFFF> function foo(){} should cover everything
[02:43:08] <kaputtmacher> hi there
[02:43:15] <niftylettuce> any reason why submit() is not working properly in this example? http://stackoverflow.com/a/1164177
[02:43:25] <Cork> nFFF: you need to use variable asignment if you want to pass the function out of your scope
[02:43:32] <Trisox> you unbind it..
[02:43:41] <nFFF> Only time you'd assign a function to a var/object I can think of is in member of an object: obj.name = function(){}
[02:43:44] <kaputtmacher> if i log an object to firebug console and i see another object within the logged one, how can i access it?
[02:43:53] <niftylettuce> Trisox: i tried to trigger a submit event on it, is there a way I can reset the default state and then submit it?
[02:43:59] <niftylettuce> e.g. I want to do some "stuff" before its submitted
[02:44:01] <soulraven> anyone work with dataTables plugin?
[02:44:18] <Cork> nFFF: or if you use it in return
[02:44:24] <nFFF> Cork, ok, but couldn't you just define it as a global fuction
[02:44:32] <Cork> nFFF: though you never need to make the function anonymus
[02:44:37] <Xotix> soulraven why?
[02:44:45] <Cork> but often you don't want to couter the namespace
[02:44:45] <soulraven> i try put some buttons inside dataTables using sDOM
[02:44:47] <soulraven> but i don't know verry well how
[02:44:48] <nFFF> Then the scope doesn't matter
[02:45:03] <Trisox> niftylettuce: sure
[02:45:04] <Cork> uh...
[02:45:06] <Cork> the scope always matter
[02:45:08] <nFFF> I tried reading up on it last night, even stackoverflow gave impression not many people truly understood the difference
[02:45:25] <nFFF> Cork, function foo(){} in the global scope should accessible from anywhere?
[02:45:32] <Xotix> soulraven take a look at aoColumnDefs
[02:45:33] <Cork> sure
[02:46:03] <Cork> nFFF: if your doing it the global scope the only difference is, that the function won't have a name, and when its parsed
[02:46:08] <Xotix> soulraven: http://pastebin.com/qHGLe226 i'm adding icons liek that to the last column. aTargets 4
[02:46:32] <Blaster> Do you guys think it's worth going the route of making a website fall back gracefully is JS is disabled?
[02:46:46] <Cork> nFFF: that was from the view of an anonymus function btw
[02:47:16] <niftylettuce> Trisox: i figured it out
[02:47:17] <Cork> Blaster: if its for the public web ALWAYS
[02:47:31] <mindis|wurk> i'd say it depends on the amount of effort required and type of site
[02:47:34] <Xotix> Blaster Just show a msg, please activate JS.
[02:47:42] <soulraven> Xotix, i want to add some buttons between change length and filter elements
[02:48:04] <Cork> not on the public web
[02:48:07] <Xotix> soulraven: ah ups
[02:48:12] <Trisox> oh i was making a demo
[02:48:13] <Blaster> Cork: define "public" web?
[02:48:31] <Cork> Blaster: normal websites meant for ppl to visit
[02:48:43] <Xotix> soulraven: i've done that a long time ago, should be well documented. Check the forums, there are some good threads.
[02:48:44] <niftylettuce> Trisox: basically I just bind a submit event, and then when I'm ready to submit it I return true?
[02:48:56] <niftylettuce> Trisox: thats how I did it, not sure if it worked yet, still have to test?
[02:49:08] <Cork> if its something like a really complex login restircted site, then it might be ok
[02:49:13] <Cork> Blaster: ^
[02:49:25] <Xotix> I wouldn't care about ppl having JS disabled.Just a msg.
[02:49:30] <Blaster> Cork: What if your whole site is built around a service written in JavaScript?
[02:49:37] <soulraven> Xotix, i have check , but i don't  have find much: i am traying with
[02:49:37] <soulraven> sDom
[02:49:48] <Cork> Blaster: then you've built the site wrong
[02:50:02] <Cork> Blaster: js should never be mandatory to access content
[02:50:24] <Cork> you should have a basic page, that you extend with css and js
[02:50:42] <Cork> where pagin (for example) works with normal full page reloads
[02:50:47] <Cork> that you then overide with ajax calls
[02:50:49] <mindis|wurk> sites that load all the content with js are almost as bad as flash sites
[02:51:02] <Xotix> souldraven yes, exactly. Its a bit tricky, try reading the forums. I can't remember it but it isn't that hard if you get it once.
[02:51:07] <Cork> ya, i hate them, and often just ignore there existence
[02:51:22] <Cork> (like the jquery forums)
[02:52:05] <Blaster> So should you use standard elements/page loads then use jQuery to remove those and override them
[02:52:26] <Blaster> Hmm
[02:52:29] <Trisox> niftylettuce
[02:52:30] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/76bNa/2/
[02:52:34] <Trisox> you mean that?
[02:52:42] <Trisox> brb meeting
[02:54:02] <niftylettuce> Trisox: i want to submit the form after I change a form value manually
[02:54:07] <mindis|wurk> Blaster ideally your site should work just as well with plain html as with css and js
[02:54:25] <mindis|wurk> though that may be difficult to achieve with complex layouts
[02:54:41] <Blaster> There is a pretty popular new payment provider that doesn't work unless Javascript is enabled
[02:54:56] <mindis|wurk> yep, plenty of sites like that
[02:55:01] <Blaster> Do people without Javascript enabled really spend money?
[02:55:22] <aro> is there a way, with .resize() to decrease the size of another element at the same time you increase the size of a neighboring one?
[02:55:36] <mindis|wurk> there are lots of hardcore users that keep js disabled because of all the ads and other garbage
[02:55:36] <Cork> ?g noscript @ Blaster
[02:55:38] <bot-t> Blaster, NoScript - JavaScript/Java/Flash blocker for a safer Firefox ... - http://noscript.net/
[02:55:41] <nFFF> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/SX9KL/
[02:56:01] <nFFF> Could you change that to an example where function expression is needed over standard declaration
[02:56:18] <Cork> Blaster: no js doens't mean ppl really old browser, it just means ppl that don't trust any website on the web to run js
[02:56:28] <Cork> *ppl with really
[02:56:47] <Blaster> Well if they can't trust Javascript I doubt they are going to trust entering their credit card number into a form.
[02:57:18] <Blaster> So if my site is selling a product, why waste that time?
[02:57:36] <Blaster> Theoretically of course
[02:57:57] <Cork> Blaster: cause its how you build things "right" for the web
[02:58:12] <burg> hello. how can i bind swipe event in jquery?
[02:58:13] <Cork> progressive enhansment
[02:59:01] <Cork> nFFF: this is the kind of situations i talked about http://jsfiddle.net/SX9KL/1/
[02:59:30] <Blaster> So now I'm doing it to impress the imaginary "web" ?  Or as a business am I just trying to make sales?  Sorry, I just find the topic really interesting.
[02:59:59] <Cork> Blaster: ya, lots of ppl do, but its actually breaking things
[03:00:24] <Cork> Blaster: if you build the site with that gole from the start
[03:00:32] <Cork> it doens't really take more times to have the fallbacks
[03:00:54] <Cork> and thats the really sad part
[03:01:06] <mindis|wurk> Blaster it also matters for compatibility. if you have a site that works without css or js you can even attract people using lowperformance mobile devices for example
[03:01:28] <Cork> and ppl that can't use a normal monitor
[03:01:53] <Blaster> Yeah that's a better argument
[03:01:57] <mindis|wurk> but in the end it's usually a matter of how much you want to invest in these things and how much you expect to benefit from them
[03:02:20] <Cork> Blaster: they'r the same argument
[03:02:26] <Cork> just explained from different points
[03:02:56] <Cork> the reason you should isn't just cause that desided, its cause the web depends on it
[03:03:07] <mindis|wurk> imo it's nearly impossible to cater to everyone. simply accommodating for IE6-7 users would be a huge time sink
[03:03:20] <Cork> defenitly
[03:03:27] <Cork> especially ie6
[03:03:54] <nFFF> Cork, ok can you edit that to show how other methods of declaring a function help
[03:04:18] <nFFF> Is foo() always going to be out of scope?
[03:04:48] <nFFF> If you try and access it direct from the global scope, it's never going to work? unless Im missing something
[03:05:00] <nFFF> you'd need to call the parent function, and return foo()
[03:05:31] <burg> hello. how can i bind swipe event in jquery?
[03:06:06] <aro> is there a way, with .resize() to decrease the size of another element at the same time you increase the size of a neighboring one?
[03:06:20] <nFFF> aro, resize has a callback
[03:06:22] <nFFF> do it int here
[03:06:26] <Cork> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/SX9KL/2/
[03:06:27] <nFFF> ?resize(function(){})
[03:06:28] <bot-t> nFFF, .resize() - Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[03:06:53] <aro> i dont see the callback in the api
[03:07:04] <Cork> nFFF: but like i said, there isn't really any time you _need_ to not have a name on a function
[03:07:55] <Cork> resize doesn't have a callback
[03:08:03] <Cork> its a shorthand for binding an event listner
[03:08:14] <Cork> .resize(function() {});
[03:08:22] <Cork> is the same as bind('resize', function() {});
[03:08:36] <Cork> (and thats the same as on('resize', function() {});
[03:08:37] <Cork> )
[03:09:36] <Cork> and resize isn't used to resize an element
[03:09:43] <aro> Cork: yes it is
[03:09:44] <Cork> only listen
[03:09:51] <Cork> then your using a plugin
[03:09:58] <aro> resizeable from jquery ui
[03:10:06] <Cork> there you go :)
[03:10:14] <aro> thats not a plugin?
[03:10:24] <Cork> it is, its a plugin for jquery
[03:10:49] <Cork> jquery > jquery-ui > jquery-ui plugins
[03:11:15] <aro> i thought it was technically an interaction
[03:11:24] <aro> at any rate, it doesnt have a callback
[03:12:00] <nFFF> Ok Cork so how should I declare my functions, or there any stadnard practises/guidelines, or is it just whatever the developer wants
[03:12:09] <Cork> aro: check the event tab then http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/
[03:12:11] <nFFF> and I thought a handler was a type of callback? :<
[03:12:12] <Someus> Hello, how can i put UI dialogs near?
[03:12:23] <Someus> two dialog buttons near
[03:12:52] <Cork> nFFF: it depends on where you need to use it
[03:13:18] <Cork> nFFF: if you send a reference to it around, named functions is most of the time not needed
[03:13:53] <Cork> nFFF: but the only thing that really matters is if the function should be parsed before the scope is executed
[03:14:01] <Cork> thats the only difference that REALLY matters
[03:15:06] <Someus> Are you talking with me?
[03:15:56] <Cork> Someus: no
[03:17:05] <kevindougans> how do you include another jquery file from within a jquery function?
[03:18:10] <Cork> you can't
[03:18:20] <Cork> you can create a script tag and insert in there
[03:18:28] <Cork> sorry and insert it in the head
[03:19:49] <Lynd> kevindougans: you can load a .js file from jquery
[03:19:57] <Lynd> i'm doing it on my site to dynamically load script
[03:20:42] <kevindougans> Lynd: cool, how do you do it?
[03:20:49] <Lynd> 2 sec let me copy it
[03:21:26] <Cork> ?.getScript
[03:21:26] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[03:21:39] <Cork> (that does what i said though)
[03:21:41] <Someus> How can i put two dialog buttons horisontaly
[03:21:54] <Lynd> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[03:22:13] <Lynd> yes it the getscript
[03:22:32] <Cork> Someus: css can do it to some degree
[03:22:36] <Lynd> my issue was that i'm using google method to load jquery and i'm using jquery.tablesorter.js
[03:22:49] <Lynd> but i need the script to load after jquery loaded dynamically
[03:23:06] <Lynd> you can also use the eval function and use javascript as text to be executed...
[03:23:36] <Cork> Someus: add clear: left or clear: right
[03:24:04] <Lynd> Someus... that in css... you want the display to not be a block, put both button in 1 div and it will be horizontally -_-
[03:24:15] <Lynd> Cork by doing clear wouldn't it put them vertically?
[03:24:49] <Cork> ah, might have read wrong there
[03:25:02] <Cork> though he talked about the dialog buttons >_>
[03:25:16] <Lynd> anyway the question is weird as it so easy, but indeed must just be a css issue
[03:25:18] <kevindougans> thanks
[03:25:21] <Lynd> maybe he's container is small
[03:25:27] <Lynd> so it force each button on a new line
[03:25:51] <Lynd> huh, oh then i might be wrong, what a dialog button -_-
[03:26:35] <Lynd> figured it was just a button...
[03:27:19] <Someus> Lynd hmm
[03:27:24] <Lynd> oh the button on a dialog box... >.>
[03:27:32] <beasty> morning
[03:27:34] <nFFF> Cork, ok I guess I've never made anyhting where I've had to use one over the other yet,
[03:27:43] <beasty> i have a li with a 'a' element inside
[03:27:51] <nFFF> and can you confirm a handler is a type of callback or not? I always thought it was
[03:27:55] <Someus> Lynd just put in div?
[03:28:04] <beasty> and i want when they click on the li the 'a' element gets 'clicked'
[03:28:06] <beasty> any ideas ?
[03:28:10] <Cork> nFFF: no handler isn't "just" a callback
[03:28:13] <Someus> Actually i have it in one div Lynd :/
[03:28:15] <Lynd> Someus: sry
[03:28:21] <Lynd> i didn't read the question correctly
[03:28:25] <nFFF> Is it not correct to call it a callback function?
[03:28:31] <Cork> nFFF: its much much deeper integrated in the dom then that
[03:28:31] <Lynd> and i'm not familiar with the jquery dialog feature
[03:28:35] <beasty> i tried doing it with this
[03:28:37] <beasty> $('.general li').unbind().click(function() { $(this).children('a').click(); });
[03:28:39] <nFFF> Ive always refferred to it as that :<
[03:28:49] <Cork> nFFF: its not a callback, as the function your calling isn't calling the function
[03:29:02] <Someus> Lynd i put in one DIV but it still doesn`t work the way i want - horisontaly
[03:29:06] <aro> can you attach a handler for a resizable element to another element?
[03:29:07] <Cork> nFFF: it uses the variable to assign it as an event listner
[03:29:24] <Lynd> Someus do you have a link to show it?
[03:29:25] <Cork> nFFF: the dom calls it
[03:29:38] <Someus> Lynd yes of course
[03:29:51] <nFFF> Ok thanks for your help this morning Cork
[03:29:53] <Someus> I will pm you ok, i don`t want to paste the site here
[03:30:00] <Cork> np
[03:30:52] <beasty> Cork: you have any clue ?
[03:31:44] <Cork> beasty: you mean when the user click the li the default action on a should happen?
[03:31:56] <Cork> you can't do that
[03:32:02] <fgro> if i call location.reload() and I have an ongoing post request (say fileupload) the browser will auto generate a dialog asking the user if he really wants to browse away and abort the post. Is there a way to suppress this message?
[03:32:08] <Cork> beasty: the browser won't allow it
[03:32:20] <Cork> beasty: instead you need to reproduce the action your self
[03:33:01] <Cork> beasty: $('.general li').unbind().click(function() { window.location = $(this).children('a').first().attr('href'); });
[03:33:37] <Cork> (don't think you need the unbind though)
[03:33:48] <beasty> thanks Cork
[03:33:57] <Cork> oh btw you don't need the .first()
[03:34:03] <Cork> attr does that on its own
[03:37:47] <phryk> Hi there. Is anyone of you acquainted with fancybox 2? I'm trying to set my own keybindings but I can't seem to get it working.
[03:38:33] <phryk> With fancybox 2.0.4 there supposedly was a bug for the key-bindings which is supposed to be fixed with 2.0.5, but the only difference for me is that instead of still using the old keybindings, fancybox now ignores them completely.

[03:43:36] <Flo0815> hi
[03:44:23] <Flo0815> can sb help me with queueing animations? need help with multiple custom queues, running in a concrete order
[03:46:06] <Flo0815> first question: how can i queue an animation which is using different parameters? These parameters are valid when the animation is queued, but not any more when the animations is actually executed
[03:46:14] <VictorCL> how can I find a span that contains a specific text inside?
[03:46:35] <VictorCL> <span>text I need to match </span>
[03:46:47] <VictorCL> I need to find that span for example with the workd "text I need to match"
[03:47:05] <Flo0815> VictorCL: $('span').each(function(){if($this).html() == 'text i need to match') do something;
[03:48:15] <Flo0815> VictorCL: sry, syntax error: $('span').each(function(){if($(this).html() == 'text i need to match') do something; });
[03:49:50] <VictorCL> Flo0815,  I get $this is not defined
[03:50:15] <VictorCL> sorry fix it
[03:50:20] <VictorCL> had $this
[03:55:05] <xlogic> Hi
[03:55:35] <xlogic> anyone knows a good plugin for adding and removing variables from the URL query string ?
[04:01:02] <Oniklus> hi there. why would one do $(function() { document.write("asd"); }); instead of (function() {document.write("asd");})();?
[04:03:33] <steveccc> hi all - I have a long sentence of text which I want to split into multiple lines at set points - probably encasing them in span elements. Would I be best doing this using php or jquery to insert span elements at set points?
[04:03:45] <Cork> Oniklus: $(functino() {}) is a short hand for $(document).ready(function() {});
[04:04:17] <Lynd> steveccc: do you just want to wrap word if they are too long?
[04:04:17] <Oniklus> Cork: I see. that makes sense, thanks
[04:05:22] <Lynd> steveccc: if your aim is to wrap word because you have let say a div of width 100px and you want text to be split if word are too long, best method would be to use css3 which has an attribute that does the wrapping for you
[04:05:33] <Lynd> only work if the container width is fixed
[04:05:53] <Lynd> save you from coding + doesn't stress the server
[04:06:27] <steveccc> lynd: no - its a long story but basically i have wrapped text now but I want to use css to put a background colour behind each line but by default it only puts padding on the far left and far right item and not the intermediate lines - this I want to split it into separate lines (spans) so that I can apply padding on each
[04:08:23] <steveccc> lynd: unless you can see a better solution
[04:08:24] <Lynd> hum so a sentence goes over 3 line, you want it to be 3 spans which is 1 per line?
[04:08:27] <chris____> hey, i have a big div and within it a small div (that i can drag around with a vmousemove event). I need a click handler on both div's - so how to tell the difference? any advice or ideas welcome
[04:08:30] <Lynd> is that what your asking?
[04:09:32] <steveccc> lynd: yes basically - it can wrap over as many lines as it wants but I want to have a background colour behind each line to create a stepped effect but I will need padding around each line and I cant think of a way to achieve this bar using jquery to insert span elements around each line
[04:10:21] <Lynd> jquery is javascript, just load the big chunk of text in a variable, split it by space aka word
[04:10:30] <Lynd> figure out how you want to define how long 1 line is
[04:10:37] <Lynd> let say 10 word or 100 char
[04:11:05] <Lynd> when you figured out the first line you can use jquery to add a span tag with that first line
[04:11:21] <Lynd> your issue will be to define how to split the text per line
[04:11:39] <steveccc> lynd: well thats the difficult part - I think it will need to be done with php to be honest but wondered if there was a way in jquery. Number of words is out as obviously words could be varying lengths and if i use letters then potentially a word could be chopped in the middle and hence its difficult
[04:11:41] <Lynd> when that task is done, creating tag for span and putting the text in it should be easy
[04:12:08] <Lynd> how would you do it in php?
[04:12:12] <kasadu> steveccc: depends on precisely what kind of effect your after, but what about using a repeated background image instead, and adjusting the line-height to make it line up with the background?
[04:12:15] <Lynd> doesn't it have the same issue?
[04:12:15] <steveccc> lynd: well if i have to use php for the split then it can insert the spans / divs
[04:12:45] <Lynd> yes but how can you figure out where to split in php
[04:12:55] <Lynd> as far as I know, it is as hard in php as jquery
[04:12:58] <steveccc> kasadu: its putting the padding on the left and right of the sentence thats my issue - fine on first and last rows but not ht middle ones
[04:13:04] <Lynd> both can do it, and it the same complexity in both?
[04:13:39] <steveccc> lynd: I was going to write php to find the first space preceeding the x character and split on that - however i am not sure it will be that easy in the cms - will have a think but thanks for your help
[04:13:41] <kasadu> you want different lines to have different left and right padding?
[04:14:06] <Lynd> steveccc: what you just said can be coded in javascript
[04:14:16] <Lynd> and you create the span tag with the answer with jquery
[04:14:19] <steveccc> kasadu: no same padding but unless I have it wrong then if I have a sentence that wraps on multiple lines then adding padding wont add padding to the intermediate lines
[04:14:37] <Lynd> it is as hard to do in javascript as it is in php
[04:14:51] <Lynd> but the best method is to do it in javascript as you don't want to over stress the server
[04:15:14] <kasadu> padding *between* the lines? line-height will do that for you
[04:15:19] <Lynd> if you can figure out how to split line (javascript / php) same complexity
[04:15:24] <Lynd> the rest can be done easily
[04:15:32] <steveccc> lynd: yes possibly - I am torn - I know its highly unlikely but the user may have javascript turned off but as you say php could put load on the server
[04:15:45] <plln> hey guys
[04:15:48] <Lynd> huh you want padding between the line... indeed what kasadu said is true
[04:15:58] <plln> http://s18.postimage.org/ic2n4wttk/Screenshot_at_2012_03_16_13_14_25.jpg
[04:16:10] <Lynd> line-height will increase and decrease space between line in a paragraph..
[04:16:22] <Lynd> though you meant padding on left and right
[04:16:38] <ChrisMMD> Hey all, I have a quick question hoping one of you might be able to help me with. Shall I just ask away? :)
[04:16:41] <plln> it just a table
[04:17:29] <Oniklus> ChrisMMD: sure
[04:18:16] <ChrisMMD> Thanks, sorry didnt want to dump if in the middle of other peoples discussion! Was wondering if you could tell me if this is possible. I'm using codeigniter MVC framework which allows a config option to be set which will output debugging info at the end of every output (wrapped with <div id='codeigniter_profiler')
[04:18:24] <ChrisMMD> However its being appended to all ajax results too, which is breaking the JSON. ({"result":0,"errors":{"2502":["Failed to move media"]}}<div id='codeigniter_profiler'.....). I was wondering if there was any code I can include which will, for ALL ajax requests, filter out that div if its found in ANY ajax result and then do something with it.
[04:18:29] <ChrisMMD> I'm pretty confident I can do it on a per request basis but looking for something to put in once. Thanks for reading :)
[04:19:13] <gnagno> hello all
[04:20:05] <claudio> Hi, I'm really puzzled by this behaviour and I don't understand if it's a problem of jquery of a security concern http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9735857/why-does-javascript-injected-in-a-iframe-use-the-parent-window-as-its-global-sco
[04:22:02] <gnagno> suppose I have n elements in my page that all update the same div after an ajax request, what happens if the users clicks the elements very fast? imagine I click the first one, the request didn't return success yet and I click the second one, does the div in this case gets updated 2 times?
[04:26:15] <cheesypoof20> Hi, I was hoping someone would be able to help me with the effect detailed at: http://www.web-design-talk.co.uk/200/jquery-hover-effect-image-gallery-for-ecommerce/ If I am scrolled down below the main image, and subsequently hover over a thumbnail, my page will automatically scroll up. Is there any way to prevent this behavior.
[04:29:12] <Lynd> cheesypoof20: i had similar issue... a solution is to add a div at the bottom of the page of height 400px for example
[04:29:23] <Lynd> that will prevent the issue of browser to scroll back up
[04:29:27] <Lynd> as space is still used
[04:29:45] <Lynd> best solution would be to have a big footer
[04:30:02] <Cork> not really
[04:30:13] <Cork> best solution is to use an animation that doesn't set display:none
[04:31:10] <Lynd> that another solution, in my case it was something that was being resized and I had no control over it
[04:31:27] <gnagno> is it possible to make an ajax request "override" a previous one?
[04:31:53] <Cork> gnagno: old_ajax_reference.abort()
[04:32:06] <Cork> you get the reference when you call ajax
[04:32:16] <gnagno> thank you Cork :)
[04:32:22] <Cork> no
[04:32:24] <Cork> *np
[04:37:03] <cheesypoof20> Cork, as far as I know this animation does not set display:none. It merely changes the large img src on the thumbnail hover.
[04:37:52] <Lynd> having both image same size would fix the issue, but i don't feel like looking into it
[04:37:57] <Cork> cheesypoof20: ah, then you can for example make sure a parent to the element always have a fixed height
[04:38:37] <Cork> cheesypoof20: what causes this kind of problem is when the page shrinks, and the bottom of the window hits then end of the page
[04:39:08] <Cork> how you can work around it depends on your page structure and design
[04:39:19] <Cork> but there is usually a way
[04:40:02] <Cork> and a gigantic footer is (no offence) a hack, and can be handeld nicer
[04:40:31] <Lynd> didn't meant it like that, but there decent footer that contain the architecture of the website kind of a map
[04:40:48] <Lynd> most people omit footers completly
[04:40:50] <cheesypoof20> Both images are exactly the same size. You are correct as I just discovered, that setting a fixed height for the containing element stopped the scrolling.
[04:41:25] <Lynd> oh the issue was when image was swapped it did shrink and resized when newer one added...
[04:41:32] <Lynd> well guess if it fixed size then no more issue
[04:42:04] <cheesypoof20> The problem is it would not be practical for me to set a fixed height in this situation. I have to allow for varied image heights.
[04:42:34] <Lynd> you can setup a minheight maybe?
[04:42:42] <Lynd> so it wouldn't bother as much as before
[04:42:52] <Cork> ya, thats normally a good idea
[04:43:17] <Cork> or you can preload the image
[04:43:25] <Cork> then you wouldn't have it either
[04:43:44] <Lynd> yes forgot about those, i think html5 has a nice method to preload image that also is a nice fix
[04:44:58] <cheesypoof20> I have the large images set as the background images of the thumbnails(sort of a hack), so they are already preloaded.
[04:46:37] <jeffsmykil> What would be the performance difference between loading one 2,000 line javascript file versus loading four 500 line files?
[04:47:02] <cheesypoof20> One file reduces http requests, its a better option.
[04:47:04] <Lynd> does your server compress file? gzip on output
[04:47:14] <jeffsmykil> it can
[04:47:23] <Lynd> 1 file is also smaller then 4 file normally because the compression get better result
[04:47:25] <jeffsmykil> so here's the thing, I work with a bunch of C# guys
[04:47:32] <jeffsmykil> and the want to compartmentalize everything
[04:47:34] <Lynd> and 1 file better then 4 files no matter how you look at it
[04:47:42] <jeffsmykil> I brought up the multiple requests thing they quaffed
[04:47:49] <jeffsmykil> are there any numbers supporting this?
[04:48:05] <quicksilver> they depend entirely on the profile of your customers and how your server is loaded
[04:48:07] <Lynd> well if you have 4 files, but some files are not needed on some page, then the caching does the job
[04:48:20] <quicksilver> the different can be totally irrelevant in some cases and incredibly important in others.
[04:48:42] <quicksilver> if it really maters, though, I'd recommend having either a build system or a front-end proxy which combines files
[04:48:46] <kasadu> measure and find out for real...
[04:48:47] <Lynd> just remember that you need the server to be well configured on caching and it doesn't matter much
[04:48:52] <quicksilver> mod_pagespeed is aupposed to do this kind of thing.
[04:49:07] <maxer69> if i use jquery to add a new li element to a page can i access the same li $("ul#wall li:first").attr("id") later- i am getting undefined currently
[04:49:08] <jeffsmykil> we are talking in the neighborhood of 20 files right now, with about 1000-1500 lines each with the potential of more
[04:49:30] <jeffsmykil> kasadu well they are proposing we start the refactor today
[04:49:38] <jeffsmykil> like they want to put all the service calls in one file
[04:49:44] <Lynd> ie9 i don't like to promote internet explorer but if you go in F12 for the developper interface there
[04:49:51] <jeffsmykil> then break up the builders into multiple files etc
[04:50:04] <Lynd> it can show the performance of the page being loaded and all files on the page
[04:50:25] <Lynd> to be honest, 1 page is better result then 4 pages, but... 4 page can give better structure and easier to find stuff
[04:50:30] <Lynd> thus easier to manage
[04:50:45] <jeffsmykil> they just feel 10000 lines should never be in one file
[04:51:28] <Lynd> jeffsmykil: if the website isn't in the top 10,000 most visited website on the internet, you don't need to care about those performance issue
[04:51:41] <jeffsmykil> Lynd it is an intranet web app
[04:51:43] <Lynd> just make sure that the javascript files are cached on the client and not redownloaded on each page request
[04:52:00] <Lynd> intranet you will never have performance issue
[04:52:04] <jeffsmykil> ok
[04:52:09] <jeffsmykil> that makes sense
[04:52:19] <kasadu> if they are talking about a file which they are working in directly, then I have to agree with them. Better to split it up, and if performance turns out to be an issue, then use a build system to automatically combine it into one big file
[04:52:26] <Lynd> just go for more friendly user for the programmer
[04:52:28] <jeffsmykil> one more things should we be using call backs or $.when?
[04:52:47] <Lynd> you can always fix it later to move all files into 1 if you want more performance but yes, intranet, don't complain
[04:53:20] <jeffsmykil> are there performance drawbacks to either method?
[04:53:39] <Lynd> on intranet, i doubt you will notice anything
[04:54:16] <jeffsmykil> im very nervous about this restructure they are trying to make it more modular and adding another namepace
[04:54:32] <kasadu> in theory, one big file will be faster since it has less overhead and better compression, but that assumes you really need the entire file immediately
[04:54:44] <jeffsmykil> yeah we dont
[04:54:56] <kasadu> on the other hand, you are downlaoding a lot of unnecessary code ifthe page only needs parts of the file
[04:54:57] <jeffsmykil> some are loaded depending on the module within the application
[04:55:04] <Lynd> the $.when is an asynchronous events
[04:55:12] <Lynd> thus performance should be decent
[04:55:23] <Lynd> not sure about the call back
[04:55:32] <jeffsmykil> it's essentially the same thing
[04:55:37] <jeffsmykil> when is a callback
[04:55:50] <quicksilver> kasadu: on the other other hand, if htey visit many many pages which all use some parts of the file, it will all be cached any way and having the file as one is fine.
[04:55:58] <Lynd> oh callback is when the function is raise i guess, make sense same thing
[04:55:58] <cheesypoof20> Cork: Is there no other way than setting a fixed height for the parent element?
[04:56:00] <quicksilver> kasadu: there are far to many hands.
[04:56:01] <drey> http://jsfiddle.net/Snjvu/ why does this return an array rather than just the single element http://jsfiddle.net/Snjvu/
[04:56:07] <kasadu> indeed quicksilver
[04:56:29] <quicksilver> drey: because that it what a jquery object is.
[04:56:40] <quicksilver> drey: a jquery object is an array of DOM objects, with some extra methods on it.
[04:56:58] <Lynd> cheesypoof20: make the page have a slgihtly bigger footer at the bottom
[04:57:02] <drey> I thought the :first filter was meant to say I just want one?
[04:57:29] <drey> so do I still need to call something on the jquery object just to get the first one out?
[04:57:35] <drey> or is there a neater way?
[04:57:49] <kasadu> drey: you are getting just one, but for concistency it is contained in an array
[04:58:13] <kasadu> what do you want to do with it?
[04:58:32] <cheesypoof20> I don't see how that would help the situation. The scrolling happens regardless if the page is much larger.
[04:58:55] <drey> I just want to get the canvas element, so I can do anything with it, similar to how document.getElementById wou;d return it but with jquery shorthand
[04:59:02] <quicksilver> .get(0)
[04:59:04] <drey> sure I can do canvas[0], but not too neat
[04:59:05] <quicksilver> or [0]
[04:59:12] <drey> fair enough, thanks
[04:59:34] <kasadu> or .each(function(canvas){...})
[04:59:49] <kasadu> depends
[05:00:18] <drey> get will do me fine. I was just wondering if there was a filter or something to override the default consistancy behaviour
[05:00:49] <jeffsmykil> ty for recomendations fellas
[05:01:11] <drey> which is what I was expecting :first to do :P
[05:02:30] <kasadu> you could do   var first = 0; ...get(first); if that'll make you happier :P
[05:06:14] <nFFF> neatest is just throw the get or [0] on the initialiation imo
[05:07:40] <drey> turns out I want some of the methods the jquery object provides so doing                 var canvas = $('canvas');
[05:07:43] <drey>                 canvas.css('border', '2px solid black');
[05:07:46] <drey>                 var context = canvas.get(0).getContext('2d');
[05:08:10] <drey> which leaves my happy enough for now I guess
[05:10:20] <One-Man-Bucket> hello, why doesn't this work as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/scS6G/
[05:11:36] <One-Man-Bucket> is it a browser bug?
[05:11:51] <One-Man-Bucket> not backspace keys seem to work just fine
[05:12:08] <One-Man-Bucket> and the problem only occurs when pressing backspace before pressing any other key
[05:12:59] <Cork> One-Man-Bucket: http://jsfiddle.net/scS6G/2/
[05:14:05] <Cork> One-Man-Bucket: and no, no bug
[05:14:21] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: hmm, so it doesn't have focus
[05:14:23] <One-Man-Bucket> ?
[05:14:46] <Cork> you need to be able to set focus on an element to have key events happen on it yes
[05:14:55] <Cork> (or a child has to have it)
[05:15:19] <soulraven> help me please, i try to use datatables with tableTools extras, but when i put "T" inside the sDom the table is not rended, any ideea way?
[05:15:29] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: but how comme i get events for all other keys except backspace?
[05:15:48] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: and pressing another key will make backspace start working as well
[05:16:09] <Cork> One-Man-Bucket: i get them for backspace
[05:16:21] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: which browser?
[05:16:31] <Cork> chrome, and firefox
[05:16:33] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: it works nicely with your addition, mind.
[05:16:35] <Cork> can test more if you like
[05:16:42] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: use chrome
[05:16:43] <Cork> ah
[05:16:46] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: click the div and press backspace
[05:16:48] <One-Man-Bucket> shouldn'
[05:16:51] <Cork> ya, i get no key events at all without it
[05:17:12] <One-Man-Bucket> firefox-latest in linux is more sane. the div doesn't get focus until i click it twice
[05:18:10] <soulraven> help me please, i try to use datatables with tableTools extras, but when i put "T" inside the sDom the table is not rended, any ideea way?
[05:20:27] <Flo0815> can someone please help me with queueing animations in JQ? Heres my code: http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/
[05:20:30] <jmsobe> Hello.   jQuery('input:radio[name=event_1_amount]')[0].checked = true;    Any way I can substitute a wildcard for the 1 value?
[05:21:33] <VioByte> ARG.
[05:22:13] <VioByte> it sucks css does not allow a child fixed div inside of a parent so that the child div stays in place while the parent div is scrollable.
[05:23:17] <mindis|wurk> use absolute instead?
[05:23:32] <Flo0815> jmsobe: use a css-class
[05:24:38] <recentlydeceased> hey peeps.  if I have a time in format HH:MM:SS, how might I go about extracting the HH alone, and the MM and the SS?
[05:25:17] <mindis|wurk> split it?
[05:25:38] <jmsobe> Flo815, I'll try that instead thanks
[05:26:27] <recentlydeceased> mindis|wurk, and how might I go about splitting it?
[05:26:38] <raj> to clear the html within an element, I can just do $(myelem).html() ?
[05:27:00] <mindis|wurk> recentlydeceased http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-string-split.php
[05:27:12] <kasadu> >> 'hh:mm:ss'.split(':')
[05:27:31] <Trisox> :D
[05:31:12] <Flo0815> is someone looking over my code? otherwise i feel stupid waiting :)
[05:32:50] <Trisox> recentlydeceased: http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/5e6Tr/
[05:32:53] <Trisox> like that?
[05:34:46] <Milos> How do I select a form
[05:34:52] <Milos> when I say select, I mean like
[05:34:52] <Flo0815> still need help: http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/
[05:34:59] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/5e6Tr/1/
[05:35:03] <Milos> $('#id') except without the #
[05:35:07] <Trisox> recentlydeceased
[05:35:08] <Milos> oh I suppose $('form') does it
[05:35:17] <Cork> yup
[05:35:22] <Milos> cool
[05:35:27] <Trisox> Flo0815: you got error in your code
[05:36:10] <Flo0815> Trisox: i think because of ani_params is not declared
[05:36:18] <Flo0815> Trisox: but it's not the problem
[05:36:38] <Cork> Flo0815: no your missing ); at the end of animate
[05:36:40] <kaputtmacher> hi there, how can i access an object within an object via query ?
[05:36:45] <Flo0815> Trisox: the problem is that the animationparameters
[05:36:54] <soulraven> help me please, i try to use datatables with tableTools extras, but when i put "T" inside the sDom the table is not rended, any ideea way?
[05:36:57] <Trisox> indeed )
[05:37:04] <Cork> Flo0815: and you should use parseInt(number, 10)
[05:37:21] <kaputtmacher> my console tells me my query wrapped object stores another object for the dimension with the properties width and height. how can i access these properties ?
[05:37:30] <Flo0815> Trisox: the animation uses the values in ani_params when it is executed, not when it'Äs queued
[05:37:40] <recentlydeceased> Trisox,  mindis|wurk  thank you! :)
[05:37:53] <jmsobe> jQuery('input:radio[name=event_1_amount]')[0].checked = true;    Any way I can substitute a wildcard for the 1 value?  I cannot use a custom class for this
[05:38:02] <Cork> Flo0815: try http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/2/
[05:38:43] <Cork> Flo0815: btw where are you declaring ani_params?
[05:39:28] <Flo0815> Cork: thx, that's useful hints, but the main problem is, that the animation uses the values stored in ani_params when it's executed, so after the loop. But it should use the values in ani_params when it is queued
[05:39:53] <Cork> Flo0815: your look uses one value for them all
[05:39:59] <Cork> you need to declare ani_params
[05:40:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/3/
[05:40:44] <Cork> *your loop
[05:40:50] <Flo0815>  http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/4
[05:41:59] <Cork> Flo0815: might it be you want the animations to work after eachother?
[05:42:10] <Flo0815> Corey: yep
[05:42:16] <Cork> then you can't use a loop
[05:42:16] <Flo0815> thats why i'm queueing them
[05:42:20] <Cork> you need to chain them
[05:42:29] <Cork> animate has a callback you need to use
[05:42:49] <Cork> animation is async
[05:42:54] <Cork> just like ajax calls
[05:43:08] <Flo0815> but i have multiple elements i need to animate with different number of animations
[05:43:11] <Cork> (its based on a timer after all)
[05:43:16] <Milos> Hmm, so I have a <input type="image" ... /> submit button, and on hover I want to toggle the src and then revert onmouseout. How can I do this with jquery?
[05:43:38] <Cork> Flo0815: then you need to figure out where they should chain
[05:43:59] <Flo0815> Cork: what u men with 'where'?
[05:44:02] <Flo0815> *mean
[05:44:19] <Cork> every animate call you all from a for loop will be triggerd at the same time
[05:44:30] <Milos> I've nearly got it, actually, thanks.
[05:45:00] <Cork> uh... *every animate you call in a loop will be triggerd at the same time
[05:45:10] <Cork> that sentence became really wierd >_>
[05:45:22] <Flo0815> Cork: Ah, i forgot sth. sry... u see the parameter queue?
[05:46:03] <Cork> ok, so you build queues
[05:46:05] <Flo0815> Cork: i used a plugin where u can tell the animation in which queue it is stored. Problem with this plugin: it's outdated and needs jq v 1.3
[05:46:15] <Flo0815> so i want to get rid of it
[05:46:30] <Cork> should be farly simple
[05:47:00] <Flo0815> so the idea is: build different queues with sequentially animations, pass parameters into the queue
[05:47:11] <Flo0815> and theses parameters should be stored in the queue
[05:47:25] <Cork> you could try using queue
[05:47:27] <Cork> ?.queue
[05:47:33] <bot-t> .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[05:48:10] <Cork> build your queues and when your done trigger them all
[05:48:25] <Flo0815> but still: if i do sth like $.queue('Queue1', function(){animate-sth-with-parameters;})
[05:48:39] <Flo0815> the parameters are prepared poutside the queue-function
[05:49:04] <Cork> ya, you would have to call the next itteration of the queue from the animations callback
[05:51:21] <Flo0815> isn't it possible to see the queue like a stack, where i can pass items in with parameters and stuff and they are executed like the way everything is declared to the time i queue the animations?
[05:52:29] <Flo0815> Cork: i get the animations parameters from an XML file, and when i iterate over all XML-values i want to create the functions
[05:52:36] <Flo0815> not functions, i meant animations
[05:54:43] <Cork> Flo0815: you need to use scope inheriting
[05:55:09] <Flo0815> never heard of that...
[05:55:20] <Cork> set variables in the scope where you create the anonymous function, and let the function access them
[05:55:34] <Flo0815> ah!
[05:55:55] <Cork> function my_func() { var shared_var =1; function() { access shared_var } }
[05:56:03] <mindis|wurk> hmm, i wonder what i've got wrong when draggable starts expanding its grandparent container instead of gracefully stepping out of it
[05:56:16] <Flo0815> ok...i'll try this. thx so far
[05:56:42] <Cork> mindis|wurk: floating?
[05:57:06] <mindis|wurk> hmm, one of the parents is floating yes
[05:58:01] <Flo0815> Cork: another thing: can i display all animations queued in a queue?
[05:58:33] <mindis|wurk> hrrrm. i remove all floats but it still does that
[05:59:13] <fRAiLtY-> Hi everyone. I have some jquery that  gets the selection of a drop down and converts spaces to -'s but I want to add a php echo of a string to the end of my jquery string, I'm not sure how. See here: http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/17/
[05:59:21] <Cork> Flo0815: .queue('quename') should give you that
[05:59:22] <mindis|wurk> i wonder if it's because my tree is something like <ul><li><div>this is draggable</div></li></ul>
[05:59:53] <One-Man-Bucket> well i filed a chrome bug
[06:00:00] <fRAiLtY-> My JS string currently equals for example 300-gloss however I have a PHP variable which the value of currently is flyers so I wish to change my js string to read 300-gsm-flyers http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/17/
[06:00:05] <One-Man-Bucket> the tabindex workaround might not be a good fit
[06:02:35] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Working on a few tricky issues discovered in RC1 so the next jQuery Mobile RC won't be out for at least another week. More updates coming. ★ http://bit.ly/yQlzEY
[06:05:11] <mindis|wurk> looks like it really was because it was in a list. guess i'll have to replace the list with divs
[06:08:13] <gnagno> did someone try botbrew on our tf?
[06:08:14] <Flo0815> Cork: sry for bothering u again. Please look at http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/7/ ... i don't get it...
[06:09:37] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: i need to set tabindex by js in our app.. so something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/scS6G/3/
[06:09:44] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: unfortunately that doesn't work
[06:09:49] <One-Man-Bucket> Cork: any suggestions?
[06:10:30] <One-Man-Bucket> focus() solves the issue, but unforunately it puts the text cursor at the beginning of the div
[06:11:57] <One-Man-Bucket> no, hang on.. i can get focus to work
[06:12:08] <quicksilver> Flo0815: $(body).queue is not the same as $.queue
[06:13:40] <raj> what's wrong with $("'#id_" + data.item_id + "'") ?
[06:13:58] <raj> I'm getting an Uncaught Error trickling all the way to jquery.js
[06:14:05] <raj> unrecognized expression: ''
[06:14:23] <quicksilver> raj: you don't want those single quotes in there
[06:14:25] <beepbeep_> why "'"?
[06:14:34] <quicksilver> $('#id_'+data.item_id)
[06:14:37] <quicksilver> or
[06:14:42] <quicksilver> $("#id_"+data.item_id)
[06:14:53] <quicksilver> it doesn't matter whic. But not single quotes inside the string
[06:15:03] <raj> because I usually do $('#id_blabla')
[06:15:08] <raj> so then i was trying to throw in a variable
[06:15:31] <quicksilver> sure. but you usually do $('#id_blabla') not $("'#id_blabla'")
[06:15:37] <Flo0815> quicksilver: ok, i removed the 'body' ($.queue(...) but still, when i want to console.log($.queue('queuename')); i get a '[]'
[06:15:43] <beepbeep_> you should do some reading up on javascript string concatination.
[06:16:14] <quicksilver> Flo0815: I expect you want $(body).queue in both places. In general you don't want $.queue, ever. "Note: This is a low-level method, you should probably use .queue() instead.
[06:16:36] <quicksilver> it's normally a bug to have a queue method without .dequeue() at the end
[06:16:49] <quicksilver> also, that will execute quickly and after that point the queue will be empty won't it?
[06:17:13] <mindis|wurk> if i use iframefix with draggable, doesn't that also mean i can no longer drop into elements within the iframe?
[06:17:39] <Flo0815> quicksilver: i need a queue which doesn't start qutomatically. I want to queue functions and display all queued actions in the console
[06:18:02] <Flo0815> so how I do that?
[06:18:10] <Flo0815> i tried so much...
[06:19:05] <jita> Whats the best way to do pagination in jquery ?
[06:19:15] <quicksilver> if you switch to using $(body).queue in both places that is what you are doing, Flo0815
[06:20:30] <Larholm> so, animations running in parallel, any good pointers other than just setting queue:false ?
[06:21:09] <beepbeep_> jita: twitter's bootstrap has a very lightweight pagination plugin, you could look into that.
[06:22:54] <raj> when might prepend work and append not?
[06:23:12] <raj> i'd expect to just add something to the beginning instead of the end
[06:23:19] <raj> but append seems to be making one of my elements disappear
[06:24:07] <Flo0815> quicksilver: http://jsfiddle.net/ESArN/8/ -> i feel really tupid now....it says: body  is not declared
[06:24:11] <Flo0815> *stupid
[06:24:36] <subanomic> hi
[06:25:02] <subanomic> is someone here familiar with jpcarousel?
[06:36:24] <Larholm> Flo0815, document.body
[06:43:04] <Flo0815> Larholm: thx, i found it already
[06:46:01] <Flo0815> Larholm: u know how to set up queues independent of elements?
[06:46:33] <Larholm> animate should have a queue option where you simply give it a name
[06:47:01] <Flo0815> so like $element.animate(height:+=200px, queue: name) ?
[06:47:06] <Larholm> there's also queue and dequeue
[06:47:13] <Larholm> yup, give it a go :)
[06:47:25] <Flo0815> i will :)
[06:47:45] <Larholm> http://api.jquery.com/animate/ - "As of jQuery 1.7, the queue option can also accept a string, in which case the animation is added to the queue represented by that string."
[06:48:32] <Flo0815> Larholm: ok it doesn't throw an error, but hox can i start this queue? or see how many functions are queued?
[06:48:49] <Flo0815> $.queue('progressbar').length won't work
[06:49:12] <Flo0815> as well as $.dequeue('queuename');
[06:50:31] <xarxer> Ohai.. Is ther any library to open a "window" inside the page which can display some HTML? I.e. not a real window, but rather just a box where the actual page is dimmed down so that the focus is on the box
[06:51:30] <BarisW> How can I test if an object exists? I want to know if a specific html element already exists.
[06:51:38] <Flo0815> xarxer: jquery ui -> dialog
[06:51:56] <xarxer> Flo0815: Oh.. hmm. thanks :)
[06:51:59] <Flo0815> BarisW: if(object === undefined)
[06:52:14] <Flo0815> BarisW: or if(object !== undefined)
[06:52:19] <cyprox> Hi
[06:52:35] <cyprox> this is the right place for a jquery mobile doubt?
[06:52:42] <Flo0815> just ask
[06:52:43] <cyprox> *is this
[06:52:48] <cyprox> thanks
[06:52:56] <cyprox> I have a web app
[06:53:03] <BarisW> Flo0815: thanks. I'd hoped there was a jQuery alternative. If isset() or empty()
[06:53:07] <cyprox> and I'm having two troubles with transitions between pages
[06:54:08] <claudio> In an IFRAME I'm re-using the jQuery of the parent, but I have problems because the window object of the lib is "window.top". Is there a way to tell jQuery to use a specific window object?
[06:54:27] <cyprox> one is a flickering with certain transisitons
[06:54:39] <cyprox> with the fade transition
[06:56:39] <cyprox> between the start and the end of the transition theres a white screen
[06:56:46] <quicksilver> Flo0815: Don't use $.queue!
[06:56:58] <cyprox> and I'm unable to detect the problem.
[06:57:16] <quicksilver> Flo0815: and it's $('body') not $(body)
[06:57:19] <warrenparsons> BarisW: My preferred method for checking for the existence of an HTML element is if( $('p.myClass').length ) {… }
[06:57:27] <quicksilver> Flo0815: unless body is a variable which it isn't in  your programm...
[06:57:43] <BarisW> warrenparsons: thanks
[06:57:43] <Flo0815> quicksilver: ya, it was document.body
[06:57:51] <quicksilver> or that
[06:58:57] <Flo0815> but another question: when i use animate(...queue: 'queuename'); how can i start this queue or see the number of queued functions
[06:59:04] <chris____> hey, i have a big div and within it a small div (that i can drag around with a vmousemove event). I need a click handler on both div's - so how to tell the difference? any advice or ideas welcome :)
[07:01:01] <warrenparsons> chris____: One way would be to look at the event's target. $('.containerDiv').on('click', function(event){ if ( event.target === $('.childDiv') ) { … } else { … } } );
[07:01:07] <Flo0815> quicksilver ?
[07:02:07] <chris____> thanks warrenparsons - will give it a shot
[07:05:52] <warrenparsons> chris____: I missed one little piece in that example. Try this http://jsfiddle.net/HzH7L/
[07:06:22] <warrenparsons> chris____: event.target needs to check against a native DOM object, not a jQuery object. Adding .get(0) on the 2nd line does htat.
[07:07:18] <chris____> legend - thanks man. used $(e.target).attr('id')); - and it seems to work prefeclty
[07:08:08] <chris____> there may be a wrapping div additional in my code - avoiding the get - but sweet :)
[07:08:11] <chris____> you rock :D
[07:08:16] <warrenparsons> Cool man.
[07:12:52] <Jayflux> hi jQuery heads, how can i make it so when you click http://erpfans.co.uk/test/#homepage it goes to the first slide then scrolls across, instead of straight to that div
[07:15:06] <fRAiLtY-> How do I append a php echo to the end of my string and convert entire string to lower case? http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/17/
[07:16:19] <chris____> frAiLty - what are you actually trying to do? - javascript toLowerCase() method?
[07:18:18] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: I have a string at the moment in query which looks like this: 300gsm-Gloss I want to append a php echo to the end and convert it all to lowercase
[07:18:22] <fRAiLtY-> But I'm not sure how :x
[07:18:29] <fRAiLtY-> I've been trying but keep breaking it :x
[07:19:34] <fRAiLtY-> Ultiamtely it will end up like this 300gsm-gloss-flyers
[07:19:38] <fRAiLtY-> as the flyers is the php echo
[07:21:11] <mce> hi guys! how do I reference a source object of a .change() function? I want to do something like $(".some_class").change(onChangeFunction(source)) where source should be the exact element which was changed
[07:23:20] <fRAiLtY-> any ideas chris____
[07:23:54] <Flo0815> mce: use $(this)
[07:24:12] <bdi> What is the URL to google online jquery script?
[07:24:16] <chris____> well - the php echo will be server side
[07:24:26] <Flo0815> bdi:     <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js"></script>
[07:24:39] <chris____> so that is injected into the content as the page loads
[07:24:48] <chris____> so - you don't really need to worry about that as such
[07:25:04] <fRAiLtY-> I've got the php echo sorted, I just need to append it to the string
[07:25:26] <ender4523> I am making a website where midway through the page I have 3 bars that span the width of the page.  I want it so that when you click on the bar material drops down, psuhing the other 2 bars away.  Then when I click on another bar same thing happens and previous material goes back upp….how do i do this
[07:25:54] <chris____> so can you not juse echo it straight onto the string?    ..... var someJsVar = 'bob<?php echo "I'm from server side"; ?>'.toLowerCase();
[07:26:00] <warrenparsons> ender4523: You're probably looking for an accordion. There are tons of jQuery plugins to do that.
[07:26:02] <brettster> Hey guys - is anyone in here familiar with jcycle
[07:26:05] <brettster> need a little help
[07:26:17] <ender4523> thanks warrenparsons ill go investigae that
[07:26:28] <brettster> jcycle functions by element - so if i have a ul - each li is a slide.
[07:27:25] <ender4523> this may be a stupid question, but is PHP required for most jquery functions
[07:27:35] <brettster> what i'm curious of is if i can set it up to have 6 "li's" - display 4 by default, and to view the other two by means of hide and replace. So if I want to see number 5. Number 1 slides to the left and disappears, and number 5 becomes number 4 in view
[07:27:42] <brettster> no ender4523
[07:27:52] <brettster> jquery is client side
[07:27:55] <brettster> php is server side
[07:27:59] <ender4523> ok thanks
[07:28:05] <brettster> you can communicate between both
[07:28:11] <brettster> but they are not required together
[07:28:45] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: This is my string, jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().replace(/\s/g,'-')).show();
[07:29:06] <fRAiLtY-> it replaces space with -, but not sure where I append the echo and lowercase parts?
[07:29:55] <Stylesclash> i got a question, is it possible to include html in such a way like onclick="this.title=???" where the ??? are something like <a href="">link</a>?
[07:33:31] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: quick question?
[07:33:35] <erichynds> yao!
[07:33:36] <erichynds> sip
[07:33:36] <erichynds> sup
[07:33:41] <warrenparsons> Stylesclash: You can't put HTML tags inside a title attribute.
[07:33:49] <jeffsmykil> I am using $.ajax not $.get
[07:33:59] <Stylesclash> ok thx
[07:34:06] <warrenparsons> Stylesclash: What are you trying to do?
[07:34:07] <jeffsmykil> do i have to put returns in the success and fail inside of the $.ajax call?
[07:34:16] <erichynds> nope
[07:34:19] <erichynds> you can chain them
[07:34:32] <erichynds> $.ajax().success().fail()
[07:34:32] <erichynds> etc
[07:35:34] <jeffsmykil> but i could return to the fail and done
[07:35:35] <jeffsmykil> ?
[07:36:01] <erichynds> return out of the functions? no, can't do that
[07:36:39] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: http://pastebin.com/y3JrcCci
[07:36:44] <jeffsmykil> would that work is what im asking
[07:38:13] <erichynds> oh
[07:38:15] <erichynds> yea
[07:38:18] <erichynds> you have to return $.ajax though
[07:38:27] <erichynds> not return in success/error
[07:38:45] <jeffsmykil> so nothing in success/error?
[07:38:45] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone help me append a php echo onto my str string and convert all to lowercase please http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/17/
[07:39:31] <erichynds> i'll show u

[07:41:51] <BarisW> I have a function that generates links (updatelinks()) and when a link is clicked, the the links should be rebuild. So I've added a bind('click') on a.mylink that triggers the updatelinks() function. The update removes all links and then adds new links. The problem I now have is that the first click works (the new links appear) but after this the bind() doesn't work anymore. How come?
[07:42:02] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: that's easy
[07:42:04] <jeffsmykil> thanks
[07:42:33] <ender4523> how do I use jquery accordions?
[07:43:05] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you are awesome beer for you in brighton if you ever want it
[07:43:07] <yedimind> carefully
[07:43:15] <erichynds> woot!
[07:43:27] <erichynds> you living there now?
[07:43:34] <jeffsmykil> on the weekends essentially
[07:43:52] <jeffsmykil> ill be there saturday after i pick the woman up from the airport
[07:43:54] <fRAiLtY-> Ok I've got this far, where do I append my php echo http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/22/
[07:43:59] <fRAiLtY-> I've solved the lowercase part
[07:44:05] <fRAiLtY-> khmer: You about?
[07:44:42] <warrenparsons> BarisW: Are you removing the old links completely, or just updating their href values?
[07:45:24] <Alby> i have a drop down with some values . need to clone it while clone it new row  i need few a dropdown with  what are the values not selected ...
[07:45:32] <chris____> okay frAiLtT - you are doing a replace(/\s/g, '-') - which replaces a space with a -
[07:45:38] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: im there most weekends, ill be there saturday after I pick the gf up from logan, ill buy you a custard saturday afternoon if youd like
[07:45:52] <chris____> there is no space in Dog/Cat - so no point doing it
[07:46:18] <Alby> can any one help me i am stuck in Jquery
[07:46:27] <chris____> so again - what are you actually trying to do - no point in using pointless code that you don't understand franly :)
[07:46:29] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: heading out of town for the holiday, so I'll have to take a rain check
[07:46:31] <erichynds> but thanks :D
[07:47:01] <johnkpaul> Alby: your question doesn't really make sense, can you try asking it again
[07:47:25] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: ignore the dog cat bit that was for a bother bit of testing
[07:47:45] <fRAiLtY-> I have a string in query, and I have a string in php, I'm trying to merge them to form one string
[07:47:51] <fRAiLtY-> jquery*
[07:48:13] <BarisW> warrenparsons: I remove them completely
[07:48:15] <chris____> var bob = '<?php echo 'blah'; ?>';
[07:48:24] <Roj> hi i need refreance to handel touch event in jquery
[07:48:33] <chris____> var new = bob + '-' + 'fred';
[07:48:39] <Alby> i Have a drop down with value of a,b,c i have selected value a , when i clone it i need a drop down with b and c (exclude the selected value)
[07:48:41] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: Yes fine, but my string is abnormal jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().replace(/\s/g,'-').toLowerCase()).show(); it's in there somewhere
[07:48:44] <warrenparsons> BarisW: Are you using jQuery 1.7?
[07:48:58] <BarisW> warrenparsons: 1.4
[07:49:16] <chris____> it's that bit that's your not making sense on frAiLtY :)
[07:49:25] <warrenparsons> BarisW: If this is a new site, I'd strongly recommend using 1.7. Version 1.4 is horribly out of date.
[07:49:38] <fRAiLtY-> It get's the option of a select box and uses that, converts to lower case swaps spaces for - all works lovely, now I just need to put text on the end of it!
[07:49:44] <toddWork> i have a php curl thing that i'd like to monitor progress; i'm not sure how to get that data back to my webpage. i can write the progress to a file or stream it but i was hoping there as a jQuery ajaxy way.
[07:49:46] <BarisW> warrenparsons: is it so that jQuery has an internal mapper of listeners?
[07:49:55] <chris____> that says - grab the onChange of the select box, find the selected option and get it's text value, replace a space character then make it all lowercase
[07:49:59] <chris____> nothing to do with a php string
[07:50:00] <chris____> :)
[07:50:04] <Milos> How can I have a normal <input type="submit" ... /> but override it so that it's ajax?
[07:50:07] <warrenparsons> BarisW: No, it's so that most examples people will post here when trying to help you will actually work.
[07:50:11] <BarisW> warrenparsons: its a Drupal7 site, I'd rather stick to core jQuery ;)
[07:50:12] <Alby> @johnkpaul : sure :  i Have a drop down with value of a,b,c i have selected value a , when i clone it i need a drop down with b and c (exclude the selected value)
[07:50:21] <Milos> I can use $('form').submit() but that doesn't undo the fact that it's not ajax
[07:50:25] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: don't blame you on heading out of town.  you know the custard place right?
[07:50:32] <erichynds> I don't
[07:50:34] <erichynds> which one?
[07:50:35] <warrenparsons> BarisW: Core jQuery… 1.7 is just a version number. It's still "core."
[07:50:40] <Roj> touch in jquery hoto
[07:50:42] <jeffsmykil> the one right on the main drag
[07:50:48] <erichynds> on commonwealth?
[07:50:56] <Milos> oh I got it
[07:51:00] <Milos> I just need to return false
[07:51:01] <warrenparsons> BarisW: Anyway, you need to look up event delegation to solve your problem with the links.
[07:51:01] <Milos> thanksa nyway
[07:51:02] <BarisW> warrenparsons: I mean the version that comes with Drupal 7
[07:51:03] <jeffsmykil> you know market street?
[07:51:11] <erichynds> i don't
[07:51:13] <erichynds> never been there
[07:51:13] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: I know, I need it to grab the onChange of the select box, find the selected option and get it's text value, replace a space character then make it all lowercase THEN append a php echo to the end of that text value that's been lowercased and replaced
[07:51:14] <BarisW> warrenparsons: ok, thanks. I will!
[07:51:25] <warrenparsons> ?delegate
[07:51:26] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:51:32] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: it's easy to find, will worry about it some other weeknd
[07:51:39] <erichynds> sweet
[07:51:43] <johnkpaul> ?select @Alby

[07:51:50] <bot-t> Alby, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[07:52:31] <grubb> BarisW: try jquery_update module - http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update.
[07:53:31] <BarisW> grubb: I know that one, but we are a few days before go-live. I don't want to risk updating so close to the deadline if not needed.
[07:53:35] <fRAiLtY-> chris____: make sense?
[07:53:39] <BarisW> warrenparsons: thanks, delegate did the trick! :)
[07:54:01] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you survived the appocalypse I see?
[07:54:02] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: you have to understand that PHP runs once - at the beginning - to generate your scripts
[07:54:07] <warrenparsons> BarisW: Cool. When you have the opportunity to upgrade to 1.7, do so. It makes delegation much more consistent with other binding models.
[07:54:08] <grubb> BarisW: right.
[07:54:12] <Alby> my script : http://pastie.org/3608627
[07:54:19] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: heh yeah. I don't live or work any where near it thankfully
[07:54:20] <quicksilver> if you want to run more PHP dynamically you have to use an AJAX action to call back to the server.
[07:54:31] <Hawkee> anybody know a good way to get the cursor position in an input box/textarea?
[07:54:32] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: the reeds burned the day before!
[07:54:41] <erichynds> really? :||||
[07:54:44] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: The php variable is already established at the beginning of the script, this query is halfway down the page?????
[07:54:50] <fRAiLtY-> Can I not just echo that variable?
[07:55:01] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: yeah took 9 trucks to put them out
[07:55:25] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: then just stick the PHP into a variable at the top " var foo = '<?echo whatever>'
[07:55:32] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: and then after that it's simple javascript.
[07:55:49] <johnkpaul> Alby: so you are running that function when the input is clicked, not when something is selected
[07:56:10] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: I'm confused. Whilst the on change is dynamic the php echo will always be the same as it's a master piece of text established early on.
[07:56:13] <Alby> Yes
[07:56:47] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: good, then that's no problem.
[07:56:57] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: put it into a javascript variable and then use it.
[07:56:58] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: So where I have jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().replace(/\s/g,'-').toLowerCase()).show(); I need to echo that var in there somewhere so it tags onto the end
[07:57:14] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: the only part I don't understand is what you are finding difficult?
[07:57:18] <johnkpaul> but that's not what you described, you said you wanted to remove the selected option, after it has been selected
[07:57:22] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: it all seems quite straightforward?
[07:57:30] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: But I have the same issue, I don't know with that line of code where to put it!!!
[07:57:38] <phil-adept> fRAiLtY-: Are you still having issues from yesterday?
[07:57:40] <chris____> fRAiLty : http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/26/
[07:57:42] <fRAiLtY-> phil-adept: no
[07:59:11] <timwis> Hey guys, is there a way to confirm jQuery had loaded before my $(document).ready() to avoid the "$ is not defined" errors?
[07:59:26] <timwis> (in case the jquery .js file is 404 or something)
[07:59:55] <warrenparsons> timwis: Putting the script call to jQuery before your code that relies on it will do the trick.
[07:59:57] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: the PHP is not relevant to your problem. The PHP part is as simple as var foo = '<?echo ...>'; So, get that bit working and tested or ignore it for now and pretend it's a constant.
[08:00:12] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: now try to explain the javascript part of your problem because I do not understand what your'e trying to do.
[08:00:37] <warrenparsons> timwis: Missed that second part...
[08:00:39] <timwis> warrenparsons: Not sure what you mean the script call to jQuery?
[08:00:57] <warrenparsons> timwis: Why are you worried about jQuery being a 404, but not your other scripts?
[08:00:58] <timwis> you mean the <script src="..."></script> ?
[08:01:09] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: I have a line of javascript that someone in here, khmer, kindly modded for me as the previous version I had was longer but less efficient. I'm not sure where in the modded version to append my static constant text to, to ensure it's tagged onto the end of the on change text value result
[08:01:21] <timwis> warrenparsons because some of the users of my web site have a very strict firewall and won't be able to access https://ajax.googleapis.com...
[08:01:30] <timwis> and I can't host jquery.js internally
[08:02:02] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: I don't know what you mean by "tags on to the end"
[08:02:03] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: See here, Imagine my var attributeSet is a php echo or whatever, I need to append that var onto the end of my on change text value
[08:02:04] <timwis> so if they can't access the jquery.min.js file I don't want any of my code to trip it with errors
[08:02:19] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: the only code I've seen is : jQuery("#" +
[08:02:20] <quicksilver> jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().replace(/\s/g,'-').toLowerCase()).show();
[08:02:23] <warrenparsons> timwis: That's why you provide a local fallback http://jsfiddle.net/warrenparsons/ad6cD/
[08:02:31] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: that finds an element with a certain ID and shows it.
[08:02:33] <Alby> Hi Johnkpaul - Any suggestion
[08:02:36] <fRAiLtY-> So my on change text value is 300gsm-gloss and my var is -flyers  so I need to merge them together to make 300gsm-gloss-flyers
[08:02:37] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: what do you want to tag onto the end of what?
[08:02:41] <fRAiLtY-> ^^
[08:02:48] <quicksilver> oh
[08:02:52] <quicksilver> well that's easy
[08:03:02] <fRAiLtY-> I thought it was I'm just getting in a muddle
[08:03:08] <timwis> warrenparsons: I can't add a local file to this application. it's hosted remotely and I don't have access.
[08:03:15] <fRAiLtY-> Just done an OSX lion upgrade on my work Mac and sodding Mail is being gay!!
[08:03:26] <warrenparsons> timwis: You can upload HTML but not JS?
[08:03:29] <timwis> so I just want to test if jQuery loaded (if "$" is defined), and if so, then my code
[08:03:31] <fRAiLtY-> Sorry for not being clear quicksilver  :/
[08:03:37] <timwis> i can edit the template HTML
[08:03:41] <timwis> not upload it
[08:03:42] <quicksilver> fRAiLtY-: jQuery("#" + jQuery(this).find('option:selected').text().replace(/\s/g,'-').toLowerCase() + "-flyers").show();
[08:04:23] <warrenparsons> timwis: Then wrapping your function calls with something like if ( $ !== undefined ) { … } should do.
[08:05:06] <ender4523> i am using .slidedown(), how do i get it to work both ways?
[08:05:23] <fatninja> does anyone know how to make query work on elements that were brought with AJAX ?
[08:05:32] <timwis> yeah i just tried that warrenparsons, didn't realise i could put $(document).ready() inside an if statement
[08:05:32] <quicksilver> fatninja: it's in the FAQ>
[08:05:40] <timwis> working with if(typeof $ !== "undefined)
[08:06:26] <quicksilver> fatninja: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[08:06:33] <fatninja> quicksilver: yep, was reading it
[08:06:41] <fatninja> ty
[08:06:52] <warrenparsons> timwis: if ( typeof $ === 'function' ) { … } would also work. Then you're testing against a positive rather than a negative. Slightly easier to read.
[08:07:00] <ender4523> ***** How can I get slideDown to work the same going up and down? ****
[08:07:23] <timwis> good point warrenparsons
[08:07:49] <fRAiLtY-> quicksilver: got it :D
[08:08:13] <timwis> thx
[08:08:23] <warrenparsons> timwis: Furthermore, checking if ( typeof jQuery ===
[08:08:24] <warrenparsons> "
[08:08:25] <warrenparsons> er...
[08:08:36] <johnkpaul> Alby: not really, because it is still not clear what you are trying to do
[08:09:09] <johnkpaul> whenever you click on the input, you want to replace an <option> dom element with an integer?
[08:09:12] <johnkpaul> that doesn't really make sense
[08:09:40] <johnkpaul> sorry, a <h3> with an integer
[08:10:04] <johnkpaul> are you trying to update the text inside of that h3? if so, you need .text() or .html()
[08:10:24] <Alby> my problem is not related to <h3>
[08:10:39] <ziz> So I tried to plugin this jquery thing to have a caption hover of an image, works in chrome for the most part, but doesn't work in firefox, http://six5webdesign.com/portfolio any ideas?? Its the last picture at the bottom
[08:11:37] <johnkpaul> ziz: you mean the sandiego health faire? it works the same for me in FF 10.0.2 and Chrome 17
[08:11:51] <ziz> yeah johnkpaul
[08:12:01] <johnkpaul> what's broken in FF?
[08:12:28] <ziz> weird im in the same FF
[08:12:31] <johnkpaul> Alby: have you tried changing "click" to "select" on line 20 of the paste
[08:12:37] <Alby> I have a drop down with values of 1,2,3 .. I have a separate button to enable clone method when ever i click the Add new row button It will copy the tmp id row and append it on tbody as a new row .. If i have selected value of 1  I need a next row(New row) drop down with another two values of 2 and 3
[08:12:37] <ziz> the caption is just below the image
[08:12:45] <ziz> as if the jquery isn't even there

[08:13:38] <fatninja> Use of the .live() method is no longer recommended since later versions of jQuery offer better methods that do not have its drawbacks. In particular, the following issues arise with the use of .live(): <-------- Like what ?
[08:13:39] <johnkpaul> ziz: are you sure you have no JS errors? perhaps try restarting your FF, it looks just fine here
[08:13:50] <ziz> johnkpaul, woops, did a hard refresh and it took
[08:13:59] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:14:17] <johnkpaul> fatninja: http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/02/differences-between-jquery-bind-vs-live.html
[08:14:21] <johnkpaul> read through the "cons" of live
[08:14:37] <ziz> very new to jquery tho, wish the caption would be just about 100px showing and a hover slides the entire caption up, not there yet haha
[08:15:20] <johnkpaul> ziz: you'll figure it out, ask if you need help but try first
[08:15:36] <johnkpaul> Alby: it would be really helpful if you could show us a semi-working examle in live code or on jsfiddle
[08:16:12] <Alby> Yeah i am trying on jsfiddle
[08:16:17] <fatninja> johnkpaul: then every time I get an ajax element I must rebind the rules ?
[08:17:06] <johnkpaul> fatninja: no, you can use .on() to achieve the same effect
[08:17:33] <Trisox> ?
[08:17:48] <safani> man i am completely stupified about this problem...either jquery is crazy or me
[08:18:43] <safani> i have a jquery code and its pretty simple, it works on my demo page but when i go live it works except for two buttons
[08:19:07] <safani> all 5 buttons are repeated code, and both pages are the same exact code
[08:19:17] <fatninja> johnkpaul: on() doesn't work
[08:19:21] <safani> when i go to the live page a section of my document is actually missing!
[08:19:41] <safani> the hidden divs i want to show have dissappeared on load completely from the DOM
[08:20:03] <safani> so hence they connat show on mouseover
[08:20:19] <safani> yet the same exact code works on a demo page
[08:20:41] <safani> and the hidden divs are in the dom as expected,
[08:21:22] <safani> ive removed all the other code in the live page to make sure there are no conflicts, there is no way divs can disappear for no reason!
[08:22:00] <safani> if anyone has any ideas or wants to see what i mean let me know i can link you to the problem
[08:22:32] <chris____> safani - pass the link
[08:22:45] <safani> https://www.janilink.com/microfiber-flat-mop/category-html
[08:22:56] <johnkpaul> fatninja: why not?
[08:23:09] <safani> the app is the first on the page, a simple scroll over and slide down script
[08:23:26] <safani> the script is embedded in the html
[08:23:31] <johnkpaul> fatninja: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.live
[08:23:38] <johnkpaul> .live() just delegates to .on()
[08:23:59] <fatninja> johnkpaul:  I don't know, with live() it works, with on() it doesnt
[08:24:07] <johnkpaul> on has a differnt parameter order
[08:24:12] <johnkpaul> you can't just find replace live with on
[08:24:37] <safani> the 18in mop section and 20 in section the first mop should, on mouseenter, slide down the other colors, as the other sizes do
[08:24:51] <safani> but the divs have been completely removed on page load
[08:25:10] <safani> it makes no sense why they would be removed and yet work on a demo page
[08:25:53] <fatninja> johnkpaul: you mean this : $( document ).on( "click", "#members li a", function( e ) {} );  ?
[08:26:35] <safani> chris____ try the link one more time I had disabled display completely
[08:26:46] <johnkpaul> fatninja: yes, I believe that's right
[08:26:53] <johnkpaul> ?on @fatninja
[08:26:53] <bot-t> fatninja, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:26:57] <fatninja> johnkpaul: then why shouldn't I use live ?
[08:27:01] <fatninja> if it's exactly the same
[08:27:41] <johnkpaul> why you shouldn't use live, extremely specifically, is that it's deprecated
[08:27:58] <johnkpaul> why you should use live-like-uses of jquery, are listed in the cons of that blog psot
[08:28:11] <johnkpaul> you're events will still always propagate all th way to the dom
[08:28:20] <johnkpaul> stoppropogation won't make sense
[08:29:02] <johnkpaul> when a new event happens, it needs to be compared against the large list of possible event handlers on the document
[08:29:29] <johnkpaul> (I'm paraphrasing, that post has it explained better)
[08:30:24] <chris____> sorry - back
[08:30:30] <fatninja> i get it
[08:30:44] <fatninja> ty for bothering to explain :D
[08:30:47] <safani> this raelly makes no sense at all i cant believe this
[08:31:04] <chris____> okay - safani - what is the issue. a scrollover? on what?
[08:31:04] <johnkpaul> ha, no problem fatninja
[08:32:29] <safani> if you hit the link, all the first blue mop heads should slide down to see 2 more colors
[08:32:40] <safani> yet two of them do not slide down
[08:32:51] <safani> yet on a test page with the same code everything works
[08:33:02] <chris____> which which link :)
[08:33:06] <safani> the divs to slide down have been completely removed from the dom
[08:33:28] <safani> there is nothing wrong with the code i dont understand why this would or how it could happen
[08:33:37] <safani> divs cant just...dissappear
[08:33:40] <chris____> slow down :) which link exactly are you clicking
[08:33:51] <safani> https://www.janilink.com/microfiber-flat-mop/category-html
[08:34:25] <chris____> that's a php error :)
[08:35:01] <safani> how did you know that
[08:35:15] <safani> i was leaning twords that...but how'd you know
[08:35:26] <Jon47> it says Fatal error: blah blah blah.php
[08:35:57] <safani> it says that nowhere in my brwoser
[08:36:00] <safani> browser*
[08:36:16] <Jon47> try opening hte link you sent us
[08:36:31] <chris____> hehe gotta love fridays :)
[08:37:00] <safani> damn it....i was testing and removed the php function so that was actually working holdon...please one more time
[08:37:34] <safani> one more time please the function is back in
[08:38:01] <Hawkee> how can I get the value of the autocomplete search query within the "search" method that I'm overwriting
[08:38:26] <Hawkee> I did $(this).data().autocomplete.term but that doesn't seem very elegant
[08:38:38] <Hawkee> can't I get it from the event data that's passed in?
[08:39:22] <safani> https://www.janilink.com/microfiber-flat-mop/category-html
[08:40:11] <chris____> so - category listing. then click what link?
[08:40:31] <chris____> ah mouseover the blue thing on the right
[08:41:14] <safani> yes
[08:41:20] <fRAiLtY-> grr still having an issue, how do I alert what's being returned on change here http://jsfiddle.net/zuNaB/41/
[08:41:27] <fRAiLtY-> I want to see what's being returned
[08:41:32] <safani> the first blue rectangle should slide down for all
[08:41:37] <safani> it only does on some
[08:41:41] <chris____> so mouse over it, the 12incher (titter) appears, then mouseover it goes
[08:41:50] <safani> the 18 inch and 20 inch row do not work?
[08:42:10] <safani> reason being the divs hidden were somehow extracted on page load...randomly though
[08:42:47] <safani> they are just missing from the dom but they were in the code on page load
[08:45:18] <RoosterJuice> can someone look at this and tell me how I would properly separate this "function" definition and place it elsewhere?  http://pastebin.com/KjmzAdJh
[08:45:27] <RoosterJuice> very short
[08:45:44] <RoosterJuice> i simply don't know how to call the function if it's defined outside
[08:46:02] <RoosterJuice> says that value and settings aren't defined
[08:54:39] <safani> any ideas
[09:00:17] <fatninja> how to get the roles hierarchy ?
[09:00:49] <jlebrech> here's a short example https://gist.github.com/2050647 is there a similar jquery library where it loads data from ajax when that field is visible?
[09:02:20] <fatninja> I've read this
[09:02:21] <fatninja> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928085/how-to-retrieve-full-role-hierarchy-in-symfony2
[09:02:23] <fatninja> how to get it ?
[09:02:29] <fatninja> because the way there it doesn't work
[09:02:58] <xec> fatninja: wrong channel? what is symfony?
[09:03:09] <jlebrech> xec: a php framework
[09:04:12] <safani> you know...to solve the problem...i am having to take the two hidden divs and copy them two more times.....then the divs show as if there was the original code in there...which is ridiculous
[09:04:16] <safani> makes no sense
[09:04:20] <safani> but whatever
[09:04:28] <safani> i guess the world is ending
[09:04:33] <ender4523> how do i use jquery to change a CSS elemnt in a class
[09:04:58] <safani> jquery.com
[09:04:59] <yedimind> change a css element in a class?
[09:05:05] <yedimind> also #jquery
[09:05:08] <yedimind> :)
[09:05:20] <ender4523> like $(".classname").css("???")?
[09:05:29] <safani> yea right
[09:05:37] <safani> why have my divs dissappeared
[09:06:10] <yedimind> safani, they hate you
[09:07:08] <safani> who, everyone, or my divs
[09:07:34] <safani> i don't care if they hate me or not, they willl obey me

[09:09:45] * warrenparsons has 99 problems but a div ain't one.
[09:20:24] <fatguylaughing> When my anchor tag is clicked I want to get the value of the span w/class 'fc-event-title' that is inside of it. There are several of these anchor tag / span combinations on the page with the same class name so I figure I'm going to have to make use of this keyword.
[09:20:30] <fatguylaughing> This is what I've gotten so far. http://jsfiddle.net/5fpRa/
[09:20:39] <fatguylaughing> Kinda stuck on where to go from there
[09:20:45] <fRAiLtY-> Is there any way I can get this code: http://jsfiddle.net/eYUcj/4/ to display the 300gsm table by default on page load, then switch if necessary. My top option is choose but I want the 300gsm displayed by default
[09:21:45] <Rushing> hey all, i'm trying to see if the height of some elements is a set value, or just auto. .css("height") seems to always return a px value, even when i delete the CSS hooks
[09:21:51] <fatguylaughing> Sorry here is the proper link it was supposed to be jquery. http://jsfiddle.net/5fpRa/1/
[09:24:52] <fRAiLtY-> updated http://jsfiddle.net/eYUcj/7/ trying to get the 300gsm table to show first before the onchange
[09:24:54] <fRAiLtY-> but won't :x
[09:24:59] <johnkpaul> Rushing: why not just get the style directly from the dom element?
[09:25:30] <Rushing> isn't there some inconsistency on that between browsers?
[09:25:31] <johnkpaul> rather than messing with jquery internals
[09:25:44] <johnkpaul> hm, for height auto?
[09:26:23] <johnkpaul> Rushing: even if you managed to get around the csshooks, the same would be the case
[09:26:28] <johnkpaul> http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.style @Rushing
[09:26:30] <johnkpaul> read the last line
[09:26:53] <johnkpaul> if it doesn't get it from the css hooks, it looks up directly on the styles object
[09:27:17] <Rushing> right, i'm wondering if this is a chrome bug/feature
[09:27:47] <johnkpaul> to give a real pixel value rather than auto from el.style.height?
[09:27:57] <johnkpaul> I'd be really surprised if that was the case
[09:28:00] <Rushing> though i do have .clearfix applied to these elements, so maybe one of those style properties is "setting" a height
[09:29:20] <johnkpaul> Rushing: it's empty string, not auto http://jsfiddle.net/MnTDh/
[09:29:23] <johnkpaul> in chrome 17
[09:29:28] <fRAiLtY-> updated http://jsfiddle.net/eYUcj/7/ trying to get the 300gsm table to show first before the onchange
[09:30:05] <Rushing> johnkpaul: something is making the computed dimension…just can't find it in the stylesheet stack
[09:32:34] <Neon__> are jquery eventObjects really consistent accross browsers?
[09:33:17] <Neon__> I have a fiddle that suggests chrome may have different eventObjects
[09:33:19] <johnkpaul> Neon__: as close as you can get, not if you use event.originalEvent for any reason
[09:33:26] <Neon__> http://jsfiddle.net/y6B78/
[09:34:14] <Neon__> well that fiddle's using $(this). Same issue though
[09:35:19] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: that's a really interesting issue
[09:35:24] <johnkpaul> oh
[09:35:39] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: you're triggering the change event immediately after defining it
[09:35:52] <johnkpaul> and the handler that fires after the change event, hides your matrix elements
[09:35:56] <Neon__> http://jsfiddle.net/y6B78/1/ for eventObject.target
[09:36:15] <fRAiLtY-> johnkpaul: Is there anyway to show 1 table then switch if necessary?
[09:36:41] <johnkpaul> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/eYUcj/9/
[09:36:48] <johnkpaul> you're missing the # before your ids in the jquery selector
[09:37:52] <johnkpaul> Neon__: I see the problem
[09:39:44] <VioByte> damn namespace
[09:39:53] <johnkpaul> Neon__: the only thig that I can think of is to do the calculating based on mouse coordinate
[09:40:08] <johnkpaul> but I am pretty sure that jquery UI's draggable probably takes care of this
[09:40:14] <johnkpaul> inconsistency
[09:40:52] <Neon__> Okay, I will look into grabbing coordinates of elements, and will also look into jquery UI
[09:40:56] <Neon__> thanks for the tips
[09:41:11] <johnkpaul> no problem, let me know if you find anything
[09:43:18] <yedimind> i just clicked on someone's jsfiddle and instantly said "oh god"
[09:43:27] <yedimind> whoever did <table class="matrix" id="300gsm-gloss-flyers"><tr><td>300gsm</td></tr></table>
[09:43:31] <yedimind> you need to be shot
[09:46:55] <VioByte> ok i have $.desktopvars = {}; setin one JS on doc ready and i have $.desktopvars.userRecord = ''; Set in another js inside a funtion. Now if i set $.desktopvars.userRecord = 'blah'; then it saves it but in a get + each function i have the same calling $.desktopvars.userRecord += 'boo'; then on the outside of the get + each functions i have alert($.desktopvars.userRecord); but the only thing that shows is "blah" but "boo" is never append

[09:51:30] <lopret> hi. i have a small problem with datatables is someone can help me ?
[09:52:07] <johnkpaul> ah so VioByte, the problem is asynchronicity
[09:52:12] <johnkpaul> if that's a word
[09:52:25] <johnkpaul> so the lines of code that append to $.desktopvars.userRecord
[09:52:29] <johnkpaul> run _after_ you check the value
[09:52:43] <johnkpaul> becuase it's an ajax call to an external, in this case, php script
[09:54:06] <VioByte> so anything globa set while in the ajax call wont register?
[09:54:09] <LukeNukem> if im working with json the success callback should be
[09:54:11] <VioByte> global*
[09:54:13] <LukeNukem> function(json)
[09:54:14] <LukeNukem> right?
[09:55:47] <johnkpaul> VioByte: it will, but only _after_ the async call is finished
[09:55:51] <johnkpaul> you need to put what you need in the callback
[09:59:14] <LukeNukem> johnkpaul, was that at me
[09:59:31] <johnkpaul> no
[09:59:44] <johnkpaul> LukeNukem: if you're working with jsonP, then yes, the callback should be global
[09:59:51] <johnkpaul> _but_ jquery will handle that for you
[09:59:53] <johnkpaul> so don't worry about it
[10:00:22] <LukeNukem> success:function(json)
[10:00:27] <ender4523> can someone explain how toggleclass works
[10:00:27] <LukeNukem> do i erase json
[10:00:34] <LukeNukem> ender4523, on click it toggles a class
[10:00:40] <LukeNukem> on another click, it hides it

[10:00:58] <Flo0815> works only with jq1.3

[10:03:29] <LukeNukem> parseJSON('{"name":"John"}');
[10:03:38] <chovy> ender4523: toggleClass() will just add or remove the class.
[10:03:39] <LukeNukem> the json_encoded array comes from php, how do i get that in there?
[10:03:46] <chovy> depending on whether it is already present.
[10:03:51] <johnkpaul> VioByte: no problem, have fun
[10:03:52] <ender4523> is my code right becuase it isnt working
[10:04:04] <LukeNukem> chovy, i thought it added display: none;
[10:04:07] <chovy> ender4523: do you have a .visible class defined in CSS?
[10:04:11] <ender4523> yes
[10:04:25] <ender4523> with display:none;
[10:04:38] <chovy> can you paste a js fiddle?
[10:04:49] <ender4523> dont have that or know what that is
[10:04:55] <chovy> jsfiddle.net
[10:05:05] <Zzaichik> good answer man
[10:05:08] <Zzaichik> haha
[10:05:40] <ender4523> this is a great site but what im working on is work related so i dont want to post everything
[10:05:42] <Zzaichik> you're toggling class 'visible' does it exist in your css
[10:05:50] <ender4523> yes it does exist in my css
[10:06:23] <Flo0815> LukeNukem: is it a ajax request?
[10:06:32] <dns-away> hello
[10:06:37] <dns-away> anyone can help me :)
[10:07:03] <chovy> ender4523: it works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/2kZ5N/
[10:07:08] <dns-away> http://pastebin.com/h1xNKVeq (Problem show only last string from array)
[10:07:47] <ender4523> hmm ill take another look
[10:07:47] <quicksilver> dns-away: .text() replaces the whole text, yes
[10:07:54] <quicksilver> dns-away: so that's doing what it should do.
[10:08:06] <Zzaichik> ender4523: your shit appears to be working just fine.
[10:08:11] <chovy> dns-away: yes. it replaces it each iteration.
[10:08:21] <dns-away> but no show all arrays :/
[10:08:28] <dns-away> *string from array
[10:08:35] <dns-away> only last array
[10:08:40] <chovy> dns-away: build a string, then do .text(str) after the loop.
[10:08:44] <quicksilver> dns-away: yes because each time in the loop it replaces everything
[10:08:50] <quicksilver> dns-away: that is what .text() does
[10:08:54] <quicksilver> maybe you could use .append()
[10:09:02] <chovy> str += Index+Value+"<br/>";
[10:09:04] <dns-away> okay, will try
[10:09:06] <ijustam> does jquery automatically close tags with append()?  like .append("<ul>"); atually adds <ul></ul>
[10:09:08] <chovy> append would work
[10:09:12] <Zzaichik> ender4523: are you loading jquery?
[10:09:21] <dns-away> Thanks
[10:09:37] <ender4523> yes
[10:09:47] <chovy> paste your css
[10:09:55] <ezrafree> why can't i access html i created with replaceWith() in y jquery?
[10:10:03] <ezrafree> s/y/my
[10:10:15] <nick_omega> Been dealing with this issue for days now.  I have this code and at the moment the console reports jQuery is not defined http://pastebin.com/hHDdvMJc  This was not always the case, though.  i have the jquery file in the same directory as the html and that is where it points as you can see from the code.
[10:11:20] <chovy> nick_omega: you need to wrap it in $(function(){ ///do stuff });
[10:11:36] <ender4523> so in my code this command is in a different div than the div i want to change…is this a problwem?
[10:11:55] <chovy> ender4523: we'd have to see it.
[10:12:14] <chovy> but if you're just using ids, then I don't see how that's a problem.
[10:12:42] <ender4523> http://pastebin.com/etGfMyJM
[10:12:47] <ender4523> its not working there it is
[10:13:05] <fof> nick_omega: you should also include jquery.js before the jquery plugin
[10:13:25] <fof> (chosen)
[10:14:05] <Zzaichik> ender4523: working example of your exact code;  http://jsfiddle.net/WGayg/2/
[10:14:16] <Zzaichik> So the problem lies somewhere else.
[10:14:22] <ender4523> where could that problem lie?
[10:14:29] <Zzaichik> I have no idea man
[10:14:32] <chovy> ender4523: paste your css.
[10:14:39] <Zzaichik> ^
[10:14:56] <ender4523> .visible {
[10:14:59] <ender4523> whoops
[10:15:01] <ender4523> only one of those
[10:15:10] <Zzaichik> dude, do it in that jsfiddle I gave you.
[10:15:18] <Zzaichik> Than hit the update button and give us the new link
[10:16:23] <ender4523> http://jsfiddle.net/WGayg/3/
[10:17:00] <ender4523> i want the image to disappear
[10:17:47] <ezrafree> can jquery not be run on code that's been dynamically created using something like replaceWith() ?
[10:19:17] <quicksilver> ender4523: #-selectors are more specific than .-selectors
[10:19:31] <quicksilver> so the display:block in #arrowred overrides the display:none in .visible
[10:19:39] <quicksilver> when they both apply to a particular element.
[10:19:42] <ender4523> gotcha
[10:19:54] <ender4523> so should i make visibe an ID?
[10:20:02] <quicksilver> get rid of display:block since that's the default for DIVs
[10:20:05] <quicksilver> it doesn't need to be there.
[10:20:10] <ngharo> ezrafree: sure you can.
[10:20:23] <ngharo> ezrafree: what's not working?
[10:22:06] <chovy> ender4523: your #redarrow { } rules are hiding it.
[10:22:14] <Zzaichik> ender4523: so we don't have access to that image, if I kill the text-indent, bg-image, and margin - I can click the text, and it is, in fact, toggling that class. So your CSS is definitely to blame. Just remove the display:block; form the #arrowred, like quicksilver said. That isn't necessary.
[10:22:29] <ender4523> ok
[10:22:53] <nick_omega> chovy, i don't see that happening here, though: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[10:23:01] <ender4523> still wont go away…ill try playing with the css
[10:23:24] <Zzaichik> ender4523:  http://jsfiddle.net/WGayg/4/
[10:24:16] <ender4523> my image wont go away…does this have anything to do with it being positioned absolute:
[10:24:34] <nick_omega> chovy, with the wrapping..
[10:24:34] <Zzaichik> that's weird.
[10:24:55] <quicksilver> I can't remember the last time I had to know about CSS specificity to answer a question, I must admit.
[10:25:09] <ender4523> i see in firebug that the click is working…it now says <div id="arrowred" class="visible">
[10:25:10] <quicksilver> but Zzaichik's jsfiddle proves that was it, IMO.
[10:25:38] <quicksilver> have you removed display:block from the CSS? and have you force-reloaded since then?
[10:25:39] <ender4523> but the visible class isnt doing anything to the image…i took away display block
[10:25:50] <ender4523> yes ive done all that…its a mystery
[10:26:05] <Zzaichik> firebug, in the css window, is display: none being applied?
[10:26:20] <ender4523> GOT IT
[10:26:42] <ender4523> i was testing it out and tried background:none and forgot to change it back to display:none
[10:27:02] <ender4523> thanks all of the wonderful team to help makes this dream a reality
[10:27:04] <Zzaichik> ;)
[10:30:00] <Neon__> to recap: I'm attempting to capture when the user click drags from one element to another
[10:30:43] <Hawkee> I'm extending the autocomplete UI widget and I can't figure out how to call the close() function from within a new "search" method
[10:30:44] <Neon__> jquery eventObject.target for a mouseup event is always the element from the mousedown, (except for chrome)
[10:30:45] <Hawkee> any ideas?
[10:31:01] <Hawkee> I set var self = this in the creator
[10:31:07] <Hawkee> but self refers to the textarea
[10:31:54] <Neon__> I've now attempted to detect the last element that was mousemove'd inside
[10:32:11] <Neon__> apparently, only chrome raises mousemove during a mouse click
[10:32:15] <Neon__> http://jsfiddle.net/gSHJz/3/
[10:32:26] <quicksilver> Neon__: why not take a look at how draggable does it?
[10:32:36] <quicksilver> Neon__: they have solved essentially this problem in a cross-browser way.
[10:32:46] <quicksilver> I'm pretty sure all browsers raise mousemoves during a click
[10:32:53] <quicksilver> otherwise no drag and drops would work
[10:32:55] <Zzaichik> Hawkee: I'm guessing it may be a delegation issue ?on
[10:32:59] <Zzaichik> ?.on
[10:33:00] <bot-t1> Zzaichik, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:33:11] <ender4523> ok you guys are gona hate me but now im having the reverse problem
[10:33:11] <Hawkee> Zzaichik, I'm not using .on at the moment
[10:33:19] <ender4523> i have something invisible and it wont become visible ill post the code
[10:33:20] <Zzaichik> Yeah you might need to.
[10:33:24] <Hawkee> I'm thinking I need to do something with this.element or self.element
[10:33:49] <Zzaichik> ender4523: I saw this post coming. haha
[10:33:55] <Neon__> quicksilver: It must be a problem with my fiddle. a sample located here works just fine: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Mouse_Position
[10:34:24] <ender4523> http://jsfiddle.net/WGayg/5/
[10:34:35] <ender4523> i want #consulting-wrapper to become visible on click
[10:34:41] <Hawkee> inside my source method I can simply call this.close()
[10:34:48] <Hawkee> but inside my search method it doesn't work the same way
[10:35:11] <quicksilver> ender4523: DUDE! same problem again.
[10:35:18] <Hawkee> something about how search is already defined in jquery ui autocomplete, but source is a function I defined
[10:35:25] <quicksilver> ender4523: # selectors are more specific than . selectors.
[10:35:39] <quicksilver> ender4523: so the #consulting-wrapper display:none will override any class you add...
[10:35:40] <ender4523> i know that, but in my previous class i didnt have to change it and it worked
[10:35:46] <ender4523> how do i fix that?
[10:35:55] <ender4523> i need #consulting-wrapper to start off with display none
[10:36:17] <ender4523> maybe ill just apply a class to that
[10:36:24] <ender4523> and toggle that class with the display in it
[10:36:26] <ender4523> one sec
[10:36:34] <Zzaichik> ender4523:  .invisible should be display none. haha
[10:36:41] <Zzaichik> visible should not exist.
[10:36:48] <Zzaichik> ^ not necessary
[10:36:54] <ender4523> ok
[10:37:51] <ender4523> got it guys..thanks u really helped explain it well
[10:37:58] <ender4523> and i did it all with just one invisi class
[10:38:08] <ender4523> mommy wow im a big kid now
[10:38:50] <Zzaichik> lol
[10:40:01] <Arun_> Is there any way to make background image's size for any element resistant to page zoom ?
[10:40:37] <Zzaichik> so that zoom doesn't effect it?
[10:41:25] <aqeel> hi room
[10:41:41] <tetradon> I'm trying to append to a newly created div but when I go to append to it's great-grandparent it's not appending
[10:41:51] <Arun_> yes Zzaichik
[10:42:07] <Arun_> i don't want the background images to be affected with page zoom
[10:42:07] <aqeel> what is the best practice to add element within a tag
[10:42:07] <tetradon> my script runs fine though because when I refresh the page, the div shows up
[10:42:25] <tetradon> My script is inside a .live function
[10:42:26] <Zzaichik> interesting..  I'm sure there's some awesome algorithm you could apply. I don't know what that is..
[10:42:37] <aqeel> wrap() or append()/prepend()
[10:42:45] <Arun_> do you know any plugin or anything that can help me ?
[10:43:06] <Arun_> Zzaichik, could you please check this site : http://www.ultranoir.com/en
[10:43:14] <tetradon> I read somewhere that appendTo() is good for on the fly appending
[10:43:26] <tetradon> but that append() and appendTo() are about the same
[10:43:29] <aqeel> appendTo replaces
[10:43:34] <Arun_> http://www.ultranoir.com/en has a nice background image that doesn't get affected with page's zoom
[10:43:41] <aqeel> append() adds
[10:43:48] <tetradon> ahh, okay
[10:44:23] <tetradon> well regardless, it's not finding the great-grandparent of the newly added div that's it's trying to append to
[10:44:45] <aqeel> how are you trying to acces it
[10:44:58] <Arun_> Zzaichik, could you please check this site : http://www.ultranoir.com/en ? It has a nice background image that doesn't get affected with page's zoom
[10:46:58] <tetradon> I basically have this inside the .live function: $(this).parent().parent().parent().children('.comment-container').append(newComment);
[10:47:45] <tetradon> the .live function runs on keypress event
[10:47:58] <tetradon> when keypress equals enter
[10:48:30] <tetradon> everything runs, just doesn't get the great-grandparent...and yeah my code is kind of ugly lol
[10:49:18] <Jon47> tetradon what's so special abotu the great-great grand-parent?  why not just put a class on it and do .closet('.great-great-grandparent');
[10:49:43] <Zzaichik> Arun_:  it looks like the one they're using is moosizer
[10:49:49] <Zzaichik> moosizer.js
[10:49:49] <tetradon> I know it's not getting it when I tried to print it out  $(this).parent().parent().parent().children('.comment-container')
[10:50:13] <tetradon> it works when it's not a live event on a newly append DOM element
[10:50:28] <Jon47> tetradon check out what $(this) is
[10:50:37] <Jon47> you might need to do $(e.currentTarget) or something
[10:50:39] <ender4523> so guys…everything we did earlier works.  now i have to make 3 consective bars like this so I simply copied everything i had taht worked fine and pasted it to make a copy enxt one the page.   Now neither of them works wtf?!?!?
[10:50:40] <aqeel> well i would like to wrap a tag but not outside rather inside .....how to approach this>?
[10:51:03] <Arun_> Zzaichik thnx, I'm gonna check it soon :)
[10:51:43] <aqeel> is there any jquery command that wraps inside the tag?
[10:52:15] <gehsekky> aqeel: couldn't you just use .html()?
[10:52:31] <aqeel> well i do not want to replace but add
[10:53:07] <tetradon> I actually initialize a variable called _this to $(this)...I just said $(this) in my example so people could see what I was doing
[10:53:23] <tetradon> _this is set correctly when I checked
[10:54:19] <aqeel> append / prepend do not wrap those are out of question
[10:54:52] <aqeel> wrap by meaning wraps around from the outside....any clue how to wrap from the inside
[10:55:15] <aqeel> i do not want to add more html and then have this wraped...
[10:55:34] <JoeyCadle> does $.on work for ajax loaded content? I haven't used $.on before and as of yet I run $.live for ajax clickable elements and hovers
[10:55:40] <ender4523> does having 2 identical jquery codes for 2 separate copies on the same html page cause proglems?
[10:56:05] <sean`> ?preloading
[10:56:05] <bot-t1> Simple Preloading: $("<img/>").load(function(){}).attr("src",newsrc) <--- Note that you bind the load callback before changing the image src. Need more options? imagesLoaded callback: http://gist.github.com/268257 ; BK's, with CSS powah: http://binarykitten.me.uk/dev/jq-plugins/107-jquery-image-preloader-plus-callbacks.html
[10:56:07] <tetradon> JoeyCadle: I've been waiting for .on to work too, lol
[10:56:44] <tetradon> JoeyCadle: it works in some cases but not flawlessly on all elements last time I checked
[10:56:58] <aqeel> it does it is in implementation
[10:57:02] <aqeel> i use on
[10:57:13] <aqeel> it bubles up...
[10:57:14] <tetradon> but it's not flawless yet
[10:57:29] <aqeel> depends how you implement...
[10:58:05] <aqeel> i called the load from external files and used its id/class without any trouble
[10:58:26] <aqeel> on click that is
[10:58:44] <tetradon> well I implemented it correctly and discussed with Randal Schwartz on here and we found a bug
[10:59:02] <JoeyCadle> well say I attach .clickable class to all clickable elements and ajax load a page that contains html that I append to #randomid <p class="clickable">blah</p>. Will $('.clickable').on('click', function() { alert('boom!') }); fire an alert when i click the ajax loaded p?
[10:59:13] <JoeyCadle> simple implementations like that
[10:59:33] <NoiseEee> JoeyCadle: no
[10:59:41] <gehsekky> JoeyCadle: you'd want to attach it to some common ancestor or document
[11:00:05] <NoiseEee> but $('#parentContainer').on('click','.clickable',function() { alert('boom!');});  will
[11:00:13] <gehsekky> ^
[11:00:22] <JoeyCadle> awesomeeeeee
[11:00:22] <JoeyCadle> thanks
[11:00:27] <JoeyCadle> ima try that ;]
[11:04:04] <aqeel> i have <div id='one'>content</div>..............i would like to add <div id='one'><div>content</div></div>....where content never changes
[11:05:26] <tetradon> I still don't know why this won't work
[11:05:59] <aqeel> if html is getter.....can i do like this..........&(id).html.wrap.appendTo
[11:06:41] <aqeel> but then i have to remove and move the id and classes onto the parent.....newly added
[11:07:35] <ravenzz> ?wrapInner @ aqeel
[11:07:35] <caniuse> aqeel: .wrapInner(): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[11:07:36] <bot-t1> aqeel, .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[11:07:41] <tetradon> is it because I'm appending to a newly appended that has just been appended?
[11:07:43] <ravenzz> lol
[11:07:46] <ravenzz> @ caniuse
[11:07:47] <ravenzz> :)
[11:08:03] <ravenzz> oh it is a bot
[11:08:33] <jedimind> what was your first clue?
[11:08:46] <tetradon> actually, it's not the appending that's the problem exactly
[11:09:26] <ravenzz> the caniuse guy lmao or some fanatic dude
[11:09:27] <ravenzz> :o)
[11:10:04] <ravenzz> tetradon what are you talking about?
[11:15:24] <tetradon> okay, let me start here first...for myself mainly because I'm confused.
[11:15:50] <tetradon> I have this: $(this).parent().parent().parent().children('.comment-container');
[11:16:30] <tetradon> it works on all elements except on newly created ones
[11:16:42] <tetradon> how can I rewrite this?
[11:16:56] <tetradon> .closest by itself will not work in this situation
[11:17:22] <aqeel> u need to use on for the newly created ones
[11:17:24] <cosand> i was told to come in here and ask about cycle?
[11:17:33] <ravenzz> who or what is going to add those new elements?
[11:17:37] <tetradon> I would need to do .closest and .find together
[11:17:38] <cosand> i dunno shat about jQuery, but am trying to develope something similar to
[11:17:39] <cosand> http://www.ordinancegaming.com/
[11:17:46] <tetradon> aqeel: I already do that
[11:17:55] <ravenzz> tetradon depends on your markup
[11:18:04] <aqeel> jsfiddle
[11:18:07] <ravenzz> paste it somewhere so we can take a look at it
[11:18:27] <tetradon> it's more of a conceptual problem
[11:18:33] <aqeel> tetradon lets get your mileage covered for the problem you are having
[11:19:21] <aqeel> may we know how you approached with on?
[11:19:28] <tetradon> I just need to know what is equalivent to this: $(this).parent().parent().parent().children('.comment-container');
[11:19:53] <tetradon> so I get the great-grandparent and then find it's child with the name comment-container
[11:19:59] <tetradon> how else would I write this?
[11:20:05] <tetradon> that's what I'm asking
[11:20:08] <aqeel> well u can always access via id/class and ancestors/decendents
[11:20:10] <ravenzz> tetradon we can't tell you that
[11:20:26] <aqeel> we need to know what you are approaching
[11:20:28] <ravenzz> we need to know what your markup is
[11:20:32] <Zzaichik> $(this).parents('element');
[11:21:00] <aqeel> id/class.....ancestors/decendents........how we know that
[11:22:58] <aqeel> or what u can do is give your children some class and for all those newly created too..........and use each()..........
[11:23:24] <Kzim> ho i can do 2 $.post in one click event ?
[11:23:39] <rabbi1> anyone here with knowledge of visualize ?
[11:23:56] <tetradon> alright no one is following me, lol
[11:24:06] <tetradon> I'll post it on jsfiddle
[11:24:21] <lopret> hi.
[11:24:23] <aqeel> you are asking a braod approach question which can be attended in different ways
[11:24:29] <tetradon> Zzaichik was on the right track
[11:24:39] <Zzaichik> ^ And don't you forget it.
[11:24:45] <rabbi1> can anybody help to find the track using visualize ?
[11:24:48] <Zzaichik> Sorry, I only changed what I felt was relevant
[11:24:53] <Zzaichik> ;)
[11:25:39] <eddiemonge> Kzim: by doing 2 posts
[11:26:39] <angrywombat> is there a way to emulate an event listener? eg, in my example, can i get $("#some_span").click() to fire #some_select_box's change event? http://pastebin.com/ZybzU3gf
[11:27:59] <erichynds> angrywombat: trigger()
[11:28:53] <angrywombat> erichynds: perfect, thank you
[11:29:37] <Whirl3d> good afternoon all.
[11:30:43] <Hawkee> ugh, I have to add a big chunk of ugly code to my widget just to support IE8
[11:31:02] <Hawkee> because it doesn't support selectionStart
[11:32:40] <Hawkee> I'm looking at this and I'm looking at my stats? 7% are on IE8
[11:33:00] <Hawkee> guess I should support them..
[11:33:43] <tetradon> nevermind there is no better way then using .parent().parent().parent() in this sitation
[11:34:04] <Whirl3d> .closest() doesn't work?
[11:34:05] <tetradon> not that I can figure out anyways
[11:34:47] <tetradon> no it won't
[11:36:02] <tetradon> I don't know why but it doesn't work in this case
[11:36:33] <Whirl3d> I was hoping to get some input on the logic used when constructing a plugin. How do you determine which properties to pass to the plugin's constructor to make if flexible without being ridiculous?
[11:37:01] <tetradon> i start at $(this).closest('.comment-container') and it never gets it
[11:37:22] <Whirl3d> I would like to write a scaleTo() plugin that would allow you to pass an element, a hash, a jquery object, or nothing....
[11:37:27] <tetradon> actually i have _this instead of $(this) because of the ajax call
[11:37:46] <tetradon> but _this is correct, I print it out right before i do the .closest
[11:37:55] <blez> how to make button not clickable, but not disabled?
[11:38:04] <Whirl3d> but is _this an element or a jquery object?
[11:38:43] <Whirl3d> if it's the element, you will need to make it a jquery object to use jquery methods on it. $(_this).closest()
[11:39:20] <Whirl3d> Actually, you might be able to use: $.closest(selector, _this), but I am not sure.
[11:39:37] <tetradon> it is a jquery object
[11:40:17] <Whirl3d> blez, create a click handler that returns false
[11:40:47] <Whirl3d> function disableButton (btn) {btn.click(function ( e) { e.preventDefault(); return false;});
[11:41:00] <Whirl3d> *forgot the closing }
[11:41:24] <tetradon> the element's 1st parent is a form
[11:41:30] <tetradon> could that be causing a problem?
[11:41:33] <tetradon> I don't see why it would
[11:41:49] <Whirl3d> so you have a form in a content-container?
[11:41:54] <eddiemonge> ?preventdefault @ blez
[11:41:55] <bot-t1> blez, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:41:56] <Whirl3d> *comment-container
[11:42:13] <eddiemonge> blez: but that doesnt prevent custom event bindings from happening
[11:42:23] <tetradon> yes I have the form inside of comment-container
[11:42:53] <Whirl3d> tetradon, can you make a fiddle of it (a working fiddle) so we could check it out?
[11:43:19] <tetradon> Whirl3d: not a working fiddle because there is a lot of crap going on including ajax calls
[11:43:28] <tetradon> I'll post my html on pastebin
[11:43:43] <tetradon> and then explain exactly what I'm trying to get
[11:46:56] <blez> is there a way to make draggable button?
[11:47:02] <blez> .draggable() doesn't work on buttons
[11:47:18] <tetradon> http://pastebin.com/35bLJKRM
[11:47:33] <Whirl3d> Does anybody know of a good article that describes standards and practices for the passed parameters to plugins. More specifically, how to handle multiple kinds of inputs gracefully like jquery does?
[11:47:45] <tetradon> I want to get the great-grandparent element
[11:48:21] <tetradon> tried $(this).closest('comment-container'); but it never gets the great-grandparent
[11:48:27] <tetradon> $(this) is correct
[11:49:14] <tetradon> this works: $(this).parent().parent().parent().children('.comment-container');
[11:49:23] <tetradon> but it is pretty ridiculous
[11:49:30] <khmer> tetradon: that's because the .comment-container is not a parent
[11:49:31] <tetradon> why isn't .closest() working?
[11:49:34] <khmer> it's a sibling of one of the ancestors
[11:49:38] <khmer> take a careful look at your dom
[11:49:51] <gehsekky> lol khmer
[11:50:03] <gehsekky> johm riup suh
[11:50:09] <tetradon> it's a great-grandparent though
[11:50:14] <gnarf> $(this).closest(":has(.comment-container)").find(".comment-container") -- of course thats totally wasteful
[11:50:15] <tetradon> that makes no sense to me
[11:50:29] <gnarf> tetradon: closest only finds parents
[11:50:41] <gnarf> it doesn't find siblings of parents
[11:50:44] <khmer> tetradon: jsfiddle?
[11:50:59] <khmer> yeah it's too bad there's no .uncle() method
[11:51:08] <tetradon> lol
[11:51:42] <tetradon> okay so hold on...so .closest only gets a parent inside of the body tag?
[11:51:43] <Whirl3d> .uncleAll()
[11:51:49] <gnarf> ?closest
[11:51:50] <caniuse> gnarf: .closest(): Gets an array of all the elements and selectors matched against the current element up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:51:50] <bot-t1> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:51:52] <tetradon> it can't be a sibling of a parent
[11:51:59] <gnarf> who is caniuse?
[11:52:00] <Eviltwin> $.fn.uncles = function() { return this.parent().siblings(); }
[11:52:22] <tetradon> caniuse: yeah so it should work based from that description
[11:52:26] <tetradon> that's what I read too
[11:52:28] <tetradon> lol
[11:52:33] <Whirl3d> how about greatuncles? LOL
[11:52:43] <Whirl3d> or creepy uncles?
[11:53:17] <khmer> $.fn.cousins = function() { return this.parent().siblings().children(); }
[11:53:38] <Eviltwin> This is clearly what jQuery needs
[11:54:32] <tw2113> .creep()
[11:54:46] <gnarf> tetradon: it checks itself, and all of its parents against the selector
[11:54:50] <tw2113> which just displays "do the creep"
[11:54:51] <gnarf> thats what closest does
[11:55:32] <gnarf> actually the description caniuse has is pretty bad
[11:55:46] <khmer> $.fn.retardedUncle = function() { return this.parent().siblings().filter(':disabled'); }
[11:55:47] <gnarf> the bot-t1 description is more accurate
[11:56:00] <Whirl3d> or a complete family schema: for traversing the dom using "family" terms linguistically....$.fn.relations=function (rel,sel) {   usage would be $(this).relations("greatUncle", "[name='boo']");
[11:56:17] <gnarf> Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the .closest() method searches through these elements and their ancestors in the DOM tree and constructs a new jQuery object from the matching elements. The .parents() and .closest() methods are similar in that they both traverse up the DOM tree. The differences between the two, though subtle, are significant:
[11:56:20] <khmer> Whirl3d: all right, start this github
[11:57:19] <tetradon> gnarf: okay but it never gets the parent
[11:57:28] <tetradon> why wouldn't it?
[11:57:41] <khmer> tetradon: you should jsfiddle this
[11:57:45] <tetradon> if it's meant to traverse up the DOM tree getting parents then it should get the element
[11:57:53] <gnarf> tetradon: see ?demo
[11:57:54] <bot-t1> tetradon, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:58:04] <Whirl3d> $.fn.inbred=function () { return $(this).parents().first().isThis.parents().not(":first").siblings();.....no wait..
[11:58:29] <gnarf> tetradon: cuz from what I've seen you post so far, (triple parent and a children call) it sounds like it isn't a parent
[11:58:32] <Whirl3d> khmer, will do. lol
[11:58:44] <tetradon> i guess I have no choice now lol
[11:58:48] <tetradon> well I posted my html
[11:59:02] <tetradon> on pastebin
[11:59:07] <gnarf> tetradon: link?
[11:59:33] <tetradon> looking for it
[11:59:37] <tetradon> it's lost up there now lol
[11:59:51] <tetradon> http://pastebin.com/35bLJKRM
[11:59:59] <ironfroggy> would there be a straight forward way, given to child nodes of the same parent, to extract all the text between them?
[12:00:33] <Carlitta87_> hello, im trying to implement the Light box 2 Jquery plugin.... but my images wont pop up on screen like it should... i got 2 errors "Object.extend is not a function" which reads a line i didnt write and "$ is not a function [Break On This Error]  $('#gallery a').lightBox({fixedNavigation:true});" any help would be appreciate...
[12:00:59] <gnarf> okay
[12:01:04] <gnarf> anwthis"
[12:01:10] <gnarf> woah
[12:01:16] <gnarf> *and what is "this"
[12:01:16] <Carlitta87_> sry here is the page http://jamaicaholidayescape.jamaica876.com/
[12:01:25] <Whirl3d> ironfroggy, do you mean like $.siblings().map(function () {return $(this).text();});  ?
[12:01:34] <khmer> tetradon: can you please please demonstrate your problem in jsfiddle
[12:01:43] <warz> hi all. im trying to get the `getJSON` method to work, in internet explorer. this method is compatible with IE, correct? here is what i'm doing, and the request is never being made: http://dpaste.com/717518/
[12:01:44] <khmer> tetradon: if you've never used it before, now is the time to start
[12:02:09] <tetradon> khmer: i have used it before, lol
[12:02:28] <tetradon> khmer: it's kind of pointless because my jquery for this problem is flawed
[12:02:42] <tetradon> well not flawed but non-existent
[12:02:43] <khmer> tetradon: it's hard to diagnose without seeing the problem demonstrated
[12:02:52] <khmer> tetradon: wait, you haven't tried anything yet?
[12:03:01] <tetradon> khmer no I have
[12:03:10] <tetradon> there's a crapload of code
[12:03:29] <khmer> warz: is it firing in a request logger?
[12:03:36] <tetradon> I had to shorten all of it down to just the section i need to diagnose
[12:03:59] <tetradon> and that's just getting the great-grandparent of an element
[12:04:05] <warz> khmer, i don't see the request in the logger, no.
[12:04:09] <ironfroggy> Whirl3d: to be more specific i have two images and i want to get the text node that might exist between them, which may or may not have some other nodes like <b>'s and such
[12:04:26] <tetradon> my html is right there on my pastebin link i posted
[12:04:31] <khmer> warz: and it works in non-IEs
[12:04:35] <ironfroggy> i'm letting users enter some freeform series of images and text and want to pull out the images and following text, to make a slideshow
[12:04:53] <warz> khmer, yea
[12:05:30] <khmer> warz: no errors?
[12:05:50] <warz> no errors. i just don't see it making the request at all.
[12:06:00] <Whirl3d> ironfroggy, this sounds like a good place for a fiddle. I'm not sure  how your html is setup, so it's really hard to write aselector for it without seeing it.
[12:06:23] <warz> i had read that it may be because of the content-type specified on html, but that shouldn't be the case in my scenario
[12:06:37] <ironfroggy> Whirl3d: good suggestion. i'll set one up.
[12:06:47] <warz> and ive read that it may be caching the response, but i never see it make the request even once.
[12:06:53] <warz> i'll clear cache and try again, though.
[12:07:05] <khmer> warz: use debug and step through
[12:07:17] <khmer> warz: it seems like IE is not detecting that it's a cross-domain request
[12:07:24] <gnarf> tetradon: http://jsfiddle.net/g3rDE/ and it works just fine
[12:08:00] <khmer> warz: it should be loading that via a script tag and not an xhr
[12:08:22] <warz> hrm, you're right. i hadn't thought about that.
[12:08:32] <warz> wonder why cross-domain queries are working in chrome and ff?
[12:08:51] <khmer> warz: only way to be sure is to step through
[12:12:06] <ironfroggy> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/fbCj5/ here is the kind of html i've got to work with
[12:13:14] <Chopps> hey guys, is there any jquery function to allow certain chars on textfields?? i want to allow only numeric chars and in a range between 0 and 100 on my textfield
[12:14:07] <Carlitta87_> anyone has experience with lightbox jquery?
[12:14:19] <ironfroggy> Chopps: use a range input then
[12:14:22] <warz> khmer, i see. it definitely needs callback specified for jsonp. i didn't have that.
[12:14:32] <warz> the request is made when using a jsonp callback.
[12:14:42] <khmer> warz: should have done that automatically
[12:14:48] <khmer> warz: but, well, there you are i guess
[12:15:08] <warz> i'll step through it and see why it wasn't doing it automatically, then.
[12:15:18] <warz> perhaps a bug, but most likelt me doing something wrong.
[12:15:35] <warz> i think jquery gets the benefit of the doubt. :p
[12:15:49] <Chopps> ironfroggy can u explain a bit more please?
[12:17:09] <ironfroggy> Chopps: <input type="range"> is an input that accepts numeric values only. you'll want a polyfill for it to support browsers that don't do it yet.
[12:17:15] <Whirl3d> you could use this regex: /(?:<img .+/>)(.*)(?:<img .+/>)/
[12:21:39] <RoosterJuice> should I always include all jquery in the <head> file? or should I leave some things in the html itself
[12:22:07] <RoosterJuice> how should i judge what should be in the body, and what should be linked in the head
[12:22:29] <Zzaichik> In a perfect world, all js will be external
[12:22:37] <tw2113> and at the bottom of the page
[12:23:02] <RoosterJuice> perfect world? do some things not work from the linked files?
[12:23:20] <Zzaichik> external file = linked file
[12:23:27] <jaequery> how can i convert Wed Nov 02 2011 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), into 2011-11-02 07:00:00?
[12:23:45] <Zzaichik> And should be called at the bottom of the page.
[12:24:14] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, so plugins external; implementing plugin at bottom
[12:25:44] <Zzaichik> RoosterJuice: There should be a js folder that houses plugins and a main.js file - in that main.js file is where you could implement plugin. And the call that main.js file below plugin with <script src="js/main.js"></script> And that would work perfectly
[12:26:05] <Zzaichik> the idea is the keep html, css and js all separate from eachother. Cleaner**
[12:28:20] <Zzaichik> And you call js from the bottom of the page so that it'll load after the basic DOM is there. If you call from the top, it'll hang with a blank page.
[12:29:42] <gehsekky> time to bring back the flash loading page
[12:29:53] <Zzaichik> In reality it's just a preference. But makes for a better UX
[12:31:58] <xmaddness> *off topic* Does anyone happen to have a dribble invite? :D
[12:32:04] <xmaddness> erm s/bb/bbb
[12:35:27] <Hawkee> dribbble, interesting
[12:35:33] <Hawkee> this is very similar to what I'm working on
[12:35:46] <xmaddness> its kind of like twitter for what you are working on
[12:36:01] <Hawkee> except my focus is on coding
[12:36:04] <Hawkee> not design
[12:36:50] <Hawkee> how'd you hear about this site?
[12:36:56] <Hawkee> is it new
[12:37:09] <xmaddness> A designer friend is trying to get me to find her an invite
[12:37:10] <xmaddness> lol
[12:37:22] <Hawkee> 2009, so not *too* new
[12:37:29] <Hawkee> seems like they've got a solid userbase
[12:37:30] <xmaddness> Its payment for a design she is doing for me
[12:37:34] <xmaddness> lol
[12:37:53] <Hawkee> heh, those invites hard to get?
[12:37:58] <xmaddness> yeah
[12:38:03] <Hawkee> hard to imagine a site that's over 2 years old still requires invites
[12:39:03] <Wilto> Because Dribbble is crazy dope, is why.
[12:39:24] <xmaddness> I'm pretty sure someone where I work has one
[12:39:25] <Wilto> And I have an invite thereto. xmaddness, can you shoot me over a portfolio link, or something to check out prior designin’?
[12:39:35] <xmaddness> sure one moment
[12:39:50] <Hawkee> why "crazy dope"?
[12:39:57] <Hawkee> their technology, the users?
[12:40:27] <Wilto> Oh, it’s a great little site, but some of the work on there is mind-blowing.
[12:40:40] <Hawkee> so some good designers there
[12:40:51] <xmaddness> yeah
[12:40:53] <Wilto> Fo’ sho’.
[12:41:17] <Wilto> Hence the invites—them’s the rules.
[12:41:18] <xmaddness> annnd she seems to have gone afk
[12:41:18] <Hawkee> can you see the need for a site that allows developers to show off what they're building?
[12:41:19] <xmaddness> >_<
[12:41:38] <Wilto> http://forrst.com/ kinda does that.
[12:41:57] <tetradon> gnarf: I messed up my html code
[12:41:58] <Hawkee> haven't seen this one either
[12:42:13] <tetradon> comment-container is a sibling not a parent
[12:42:40] <Hawkee> these sites really emphasize images over text though
[12:43:16] <xmaddness> Wilto, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately she just took her portfolio down, so I will have to try again once she gets it back up
[12:43:28] <Wilto> xmaddness: No worries, dude. I’ll be lurking.
[12:44:18] <raj> why is htis giving me an uncaught syntax error (unexpected identifier)--> function eventHandler() {$('.single').click(function() {$(this).css({'background': 'rgba(159,182,205)'});});};
[12:44:20] <tetradon> there was so much crap going on i missed that
[12:44:28] <xmaddness> Wilto, sho thanks
[12:44:32] <tetradon> in my code i mean. my mistake
[12:44:33] <killer11> i have a variable inside the scope of a function and i want to access it from outside, how would i do that?
[12:45:15] <chovy> killer11: define it outside your function.
[12:45:59] <killer11> i cant, the function needs to start onload, and im trying to modify the map it creates after the page has loaded
[12:46:00] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, ok that's good info, but do I include all the js from all my pages in that main.js file?
[12:46:23] <pojo> Hi Has any body developed locations auto complete here
[12:47:00] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, some have forms, others have other things, how do i specify which code to run?
[12:47:15] <RoosterJuice> Zzaichik, or does each page link to a diffrerent .js file
[12:48:10] <thomedy> okay so i am building a commerce site but in the last 4 or so days i have had a collection of 11 hours of sleep and cant think
[12:48:24] <rue> Go to bed
[12:48:24] <tetradon> so the solution was $(this).parents('.top-comment-container').children('.comment-container');
[12:48:28] <thomedy> i have come up with 8 different skins/appearances/themes for my website
[12:48:47] <thomedy> if someone could go to it and tell me if you think it is at least presentable
[12:48:57] <thomedy> www.thomedy.com/~ab98641/fashion
[12:49:08] <thomedy> its my dev server i havent bought the name yet
[12:49:09] <Zzaichik> RoosterJuice: maybe don't worry about it. haha At this point, it'll most likely break stuff.
[12:50:00] <Zzaichik> I'd recommend using one master.js file
[12:50:20] <Zzaichik> But I don't know what exactly you've got going on at this point so it could potentially break everything
[12:50:31] <RoosterJuice> well i'm more thinking of projects going forward
[12:50:40] <Zzaichik> yeah for future reference
[12:51:06] <Zzaichik> collecting all the js for the entire site into one master.js is a good way to go
[12:51:14] <RoosterJuice> so in a master.js file, how would i activate different areas of js?
[12:51:20] <RoosterJuice> or does it just run it all
[12:51:27] <RoosterJuice> even though it may not all apply to the current page
[12:51:37] <RoosterJuice> thats really what i'm trying to figure out
[12:51:50] <xmaddness> RoosterJuice, you could look into minify
[12:52:02] <xmaddness> minify
[12:52:02] <xmaddness>  Combines, minifies, and caches JavaScript and CSS files on demand to speed up page loads.
[12:52:28] <RoosterJuice> xmaddness, thanx
[12:53:14] <Zzaichik> Well, if you do it right, there shouldn't be conflicts. I mean, unique id's - calling functions only where necessary, etc.
[12:53:34] <yedimind> unique IDs are for the weak
[12:53:35] <Zzaichik> And it really won't have a huge impact on load times
[12:55:12] <killer11> http://pastie.org/3610444 , the error you get when loading the page is what im trying to fix, im not sure how i would go about fixing it.
[12:55:13] <killer11> http://pastie.org/3610444
[12:55:29] <RoosterJuice> yedimind, you have an alternative methodology?
[12:55:36] <RoosterJuice> or is there really no perfect answer to this
[12:55:47] <yedimind> i wasnt paying attention to anything, i was just being a smart ass
[12:55:51] <Zzaichik> he's being a smart ass
[12:55:55] <Zzaichik> haha - yep I knew it
[12:55:56] <yedimind> i, personally, give every single one of my elements the exact same ID
[12:56:08] <yedimind> just for fun
[12:56:11] <Zzaichik> what a liar
[12:56:25] <Zzaichik> just to make it exciting huh
[12:56:29] <RoosterJuice> lol
[12:56:55] <RoosterJuice> i may be a noob, but i'm not 2 chromosomes away from a potato
[12:58:30] <xmaddness> eh
[12:58:33] <xmaddness> all you need is one
[12:58:41] <xmaddness> with a crap ton of custom binds
[12:58:52] <Zzaichik> lol
[13:08:50] <thomedy> if i set an event inside a delay function will that next event absolutely wait until my innerfuncion has occured
[13:09:40] <Brodingo> delay is for animation queue
[13:10:46] <thomedy> i googled i need something to make show() to wait
[13:10:57] <thomedy> so i read that show() doesn't work with delay
[13:11:01] <thomedy> or wiat for it
[13:11:19] <Zzaichik> .animate()
[13:11:41] <thomedy> okay so if i run animate and put display, block or something
[13:11:46] <thomedy> than i can run delay
[13:13:05] <Zzaichik> no wait. that might not do what you're wanting. Cuz you're wanting to delay an event right?
[13:13:28] <thomedy> basically i have an image that i am presenting
[13:13:41] <thomedy> and then i am also showing a size
[13:13:52] <thomedy> but the size shows before the image
[13:13:57] <thomedy> cuz the image has to load
[13:14:57] <Zzaichik> Oh. .animate() with a .delay() might work then
[13:15:13] <thomedy> cool
[13:15:27] <thomedy> i could really use a nap
[13:15:34] <thomedy> im so so so so tired
[13:15:55] <raj> what's wrong with this code that alert doesn't hit? http://paste.ofcode.org/SqmqNNY3fJqAv76JUzUzHh
[13:17:58] <Whirl3d> thomedy, just hide your image dims until your image loads using a callback attached to the load method on your image
[13:18:29] <jaequery> anyone here used date.js?
[13:18:32] <jaequery> start = new Date.parse("Mon Dec 12 2011 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)").toString("yyyy-MM-dd");   why does this return false?
[13:19:26] <Zzaichik> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/Q78kC/   it appears to work.
[13:20:42] <ngharo> ?js new Date.parse("Mon Dec 12 2011 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)")

[13:23:38] <thomedy> im sorry whirl3d what is hid my image dims
[13:24:26] <Zzaichik> divs?
[13:26:53] <raj> what's a reason a class doesn't recognize it's being clicked?
[13:28:11] <Zzaichik> did you not see my post, raj?
[13:28:19] <raj> you said it worked in jsfiddle?
[13:28:26] <Zzaichik> and it does..
[13:28:42] <raj> right, but it's not recognizing a click of a particular class
[13:28:49] <raj> but if I choose $('body') instead, it works
[13:28:54] <raj> or a variety of other classes
[13:29:04] <Zzaichik> is the element being added dynamically?
[13:29:08] <raj> yes
[13:29:16] <Zzaichik> ?.on @raj
[13:29:17] <bot-t1> raj, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:31:18] <raj> Zzaichik, didn't work either
[13:32:18] <raj> it doesn't hit the alert
[13:33:07] <raj> function eventHandler() {$('.single').on('click', function(event){alert('hi');});};
[13:33:55] <adoven> raj: you need to attach the event to a parent of the dynamically added element
[13:34:07] <adoven> e.g. $('.parent-of-single .single').on('click')...
[13:34:12] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/Q78kC/1/  raj
[13:34:15] <raj> oh ok
[13:34:51] <adoven> (my example was wrong, itd be $('.parent-of-single').on('.single', 'click, function ())
[13:34:54] <adoven> )
[13:34:59] <warrenparsons> adoven: Try again.
[13:35:06] <Zzaichik> one more time...
[13:35:24] <adoven> oh
[13:35:27] <adoven> :)
[13:35:45] <axiak> hey - I was wondering if there were any eta/updates to the new plugin site?
[13:36:04] <raj> so then I can't keep all my eventHandlers together?
[13:36:39] <Zzaichik> What do you mean. in your eventHandler func? Sure you can.
[13:36:54] <raj> well, i'm creating the element in another function
[13:38:14] <Zzaichik> Shouldn't matter
[13:40:54] <raj> Zzaichik, but i'm showing the click event in the other function, and not in my event handler
[13:41:48] <Zzaichik> I don't follow.  This should work just the same   http://jsfiddle.net/Q78kC/2/   if that's what you're talking about.
[13:43:40] <raj> oh, i see what you did
[13:43:41] <raj> nice
[13:43:45] <raj> thanks
[13:43:52] <Zzaichik> ¿esta bien?   cool. np
[13:44:23] <raj> yes sir, that worked great
[13:45:04] <Zzaichik> awesome
[13:45:46] <lukebrannon> i'm using the jquery selectable method to select a range of cells in a table… i want to be able to copy these cells using the standard copy and paste keys, but since these cells aren't actually "selected" is there a way to override the copy/paste events to trigger with the ".ui-selected" class is present?
[13:46:04] <subm0rphic> Hey guys
[13:48:06] <raj> does this create a new `this`? $('.list').not($(this)).on('click','.single',function(event){
[13:49:09] <raj> seems not
[13:49:27] <raj> how can I effect all other .single's except the current one being clicked?
[13:49:32] <subm0rphic> I have, what i assume is an easy question about .animate. If someone could direct their eyes to http://projectomni.com/nimbuscanada/ and roll over the top navigation...Is there anyway for it to go back to not having background color after mouse out?
[13:49:56] <ajpiano> raj:  you have to do that inside of the click handler
[13:50:43] <ajpiano> var allSingles = $(".single").on("click', function) {  allSingles.not( this ).addClass("foo")  });
[13:50:45] <ajpiano> raj ^^
[13:50:50] <ajpiano> assuming they're all static on the page
[13:51:04] <ajpiano> if they're coming and going you'd take a slightly different approach
[13:51:05] <Whirl3d> thomedy, you said that yourr image dims showed before your image loaded and wanted to delay until the image was loaded to show them...would delay work? I suggested that you wait until the image loads using a callback on the load function for the image
[13:53:09] <subm0rphic> it doesn't make sense....none should work, no?
[13:53:30] <raj> ajpiano, http://paste.ofcode.org/mrnQ28UNvcLwmfHX2zk5MC ?
[13:54:10] <ajpiano> yeah this is crazy
[13:54:20] <raj> cuz .single elements are dynamically created
[13:54:50] <ajpiano> raj: what is the point of this? when one of them is clicked, bind a click handler to all the other ones???
[13:55:20] <raj> well no, I'd like for only one .single to have it's background set to rgba(...) at a time
[13:55:25] <raj> all others should have a white background
[13:55:30] <ajpiano> right
[13:55:36] <ajpiano> your code attaches another handler
[13:56:16] <raj> so just bind a function?
[13:57:03] <raj> nope, bind didn't work either
[13:57:16] <ajpiano> no
[13:57:19] <ajpiano> i'm showing you how to do it
[13:57:24] <raj> oh
[13:57:32] <ajpiano> you should really use classes
[13:57:39] <ajpiano> instead of manipulating css directly
[13:57:44] <ajpiano> do you mind if i show the example using that instead
[13:57:46] <raj> oh, so change the class when it's clicked
[13:57:51] <raj> no prob
[13:57:58] <ajpiano> raj: and is .list static on the page
[13:57:59] <raj> it's a good idea to have a clicked class actually
[13:58:01] <raj> i didn't think of that
[13:58:01] <ajpiano> only the .single comes in new /
[13:58:09] <ajpiano> yeah, it's always better to manipulate classes than just do ad hoc styles
[13:58:15] <raj> yes, .list is static
[13:58:17] <ajpiano> great
[13:59:45] <ajpiano> raj: http://paste.ofcode.org/wMZdh9DPKwF6m9HRcCDSGj
[14:01:53] <raj> ajpiano, thanks, trying it now
[14:03:04] <Zzaichik> ajpiano:  is .not() necessary in that?
[14:04:38] <ajpiano> you're right
[14:04:46] <ajpiano> it shouldn't even be there
[14:04:57] <ajpiano> i kind of wanted him to see that you didn't need to pass a jquery to not
[14:04:59] <ajpiano> but yea, raj 66
[14:05:01] <ajpiano> ^^
[14:05:22] <Zzaichik> ahh
[14:05:33] <subm0rphic> ajpiano: Do you have a few moments?
[14:05:40] <raj> why don't you need not?
[14:06:46] <Zzaichik> Well, because when that line of code is triggered, the current .single hasn't even had the class of active applied yet.
[14:06:50] <ajpiano> raj:  because step one is like... set all of them back to normal. step 2 is just add active to it
[14:07:16] <Vaerros> is there any real performance difference with .not() vs :not() ?
[14:07:22] <PilotBob> Hi All.... any idea why this will not clear the text boxes in my cloned tr? $("tr:last", this).clone(true).filter(":input").val("").end().appendTo(this);
[14:08:57] <raj> ah, i see
[14:09:00] <raj> works nicely
[14:09:19] <raj> what if I wanted ctrl button to be able to select multiple...i'd have to start over I suppose?
[14:09:27] <a|3x> hi
[14:09:31] <raj> like, I can't build on this
[14:10:37] <a|3x> how would i do something like this: $('input').val(that particular element.val()+'x') ?
[14:11:08] <raj> $('input').val($(this).val() + 'x')
[14:11:13] <bartmax> how can i write from javascript (true or false) and always false if javascript is not enabled before document ready. ?
[14:12:00] <raj> bartmax, have an element that says "false" and then change the html on document.ready
[14:12:08] <raj> of that element
[14:12:08] <bartmax> raj i need it before document ready
[14:12:14] <bartmax> exactly when is rendering.
[14:12:34] <PilotBob> Hi All.... any idea why this will not clear the text boxes in my cloned tr? $("tr:last", this).clone(true).filter(":input").val("").end().appendTo(this);
[14:13:22] <bartmax> PilotBob: you arent clearing them
[14:13:26] <PilotBob> ah... now that I look at it I may know why
[14:13:32] <PilotBob> doesn't val("") do it.
[14:13:36] <xec> PilotBob: you're selecting a tr and cloning it, and then you.. filter out anything that isnt a input?
[14:13:40] <amon293> hey! i want to do an automatically fade in to an image. can you help me getting some code please?
[14:14:06] <mosdef100200> Hi there I'm trying to make this but I would like the divs to toggle up and down but not on top of one another http://jsfiddle.net/colesy/DMmDQ/ would anyone have any ideas?
[14:14:16] <PilotBob> xec: right... saw that... how do I say from that tr I want the inputs in it?
[14:14:43] <xec> PilotBob: maybe you want .find("input")
[14:14:47] <bartmax> find input
[14:14:49] <bartmax> instead of filter
[14:15:03] <bartmax> actually filter does not return the inputs ?
[14:15:06] <bartmax> ? filter
[14:15:06] <bot-t1> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:15:14] <bartmax> ? find
[14:15:14] <bot-t1> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:15:40] <PilotBob> bartmax: ah, sounds like I want find not filter... trying...
[14:15:48] <bartmax> difference is sutile.
[14:16:19] <PilotBob> bartmax: do I still need the .end() will that go back to the tr?
[14:16:26] <bartmax> yes
[14:17:02] <amon293> i want to fade in an image without a click
[14:17:05] <amon293> how do i do that?
[14:17:15] <bartmax> amon293: when do u want it to fade ?
[14:17:22] <PilotBob> bartmax: awesome... find was the magic I needed.
[14:17:27] <PilotBob> bartmax: thanks.
[14:17:27] <amon293> when the page loads
[14:17:52] <bartmax> $(document).ready(function() { $('ImageID').fadeIn(); });
[14:18:09] <nveid> anyone know of a zooming plugin that will work nicely with prettyPhoto?
[14:18:16] <bartmax> jqZoom
[14:18:37] * nveid googles it
[14:18:37] <raj> ajpiano, what's wrong with $('document').not('.single').on('click', function(event){$(this).find('.single').removeClass('selected')})
[14:19:23] <ajpiano> raj: use your debugger to find out what 'this' is and you will likely find your way to the solution
[14:19:24] <raj> so it unselected when a click is made outside any of the .single items
[14:19:37] <raj> oh
[14:20:01] <PilotBob> ok... so a further question on clone... passing true will clone the event handlers... does that mean if an input has the autocomplete plugin attached to it that the copy will as well?
[14:20:16] <bartmax> PilotBob: i guess it does
[14:20:52] <raj> ajpiano, it doesn't hit
[14:20:59] <raj> like it never enters that function
[14:21:01] <PilotBob> bartmax: ok I hope so. I'll have to try it.
[14:21:03] <bartmax> hey ajpiano im using knockout ... quite impressive, did a heavy development already and i love it. thanks for introduce me to it :D
[14:21:04] <ajpiano> raj: omg
[14:21:14] <ajpiano> raj: $(document) not $("document")
[14:21:18] <ajpiano> raj: and by definition
[14:21:28] <ajpiano> the document will not be ".single"
[14:21:36] <bartmax> lol
[14:21:38] <raj> oh
[14:21:50] <ajpiano> raj: i think you are looking for $(document).on("click", ":not(.single)", function(e) { });
[14:21:50] <raj> i was trying to say if anything is clicked except for .single, do this
[14:21:58] <raj> yes i am
[14:22:42] <bartmax> ajpiano: will jQuery marry with a mvc framework (or create their own) in the future ?
[14:22:59] <a|3x> raj, that doesn't work
[14:22:59] <ajpiano> bartmax: awesome, glad to have helped enlightened :)
[14:23:07] <ajpiano> bartmax: probably not
[14:24:00] <bartmax> ajpiano: great, i like the fact that ko works with jquery and have jquery tmpl out of the box.
[14:24:06] <Zzaichik> jQuery is just a library, you can use it in.. backbone.js or whatever framework you'd like.
[14:24:15] <a|3x> how would i do something like this: $('input').val(that particular element.val()+'x') ?
[14:24:31] <bartmax> a|3x: that was already answered like 5 mins ago. read history
[14:24:37] <a|3x> doesn't work
[14:24:38] <caniuse> doesn't work: What do you mean it doesn't work?  What happens when you try to run it?  What's the output?  What's the error message?  Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[14:24:47] <Zzaichik> That's cool, about ko.
[14:24:57] <a|3x> $(this).val() = null
[14:24:57] <raj> ajpiano, this never adds a background on click http://paste.ofcode.org/xPDFvQ3WnsaUT8h2XWNp4K
[14:25:11] <raj> ever since I added the removeClass event for :not(.single-file)
[14:25:19] <Zzaichik> raj: use jsfiddle yo
[14:25:31] <raj> k
[14:25:38] <Zzaichik> and create a working example. It's easier to update etc.
[14:25:49] <raj> true
[14:27:00] <ajpiano> raj: you probably just need to put event.stopPropagation() inside of the first handler
[14:27:07] <bartmax> how to code a replace an attribute from an element in plain javascript. (i don't know much plain js). i need to do $('sidebar').attr({'class': true, 'data-isOpen':true}) in plain js....
[14:27:13] <ajpiano> raj: otherwise the click bubbles to the document which removes the class from everything
[14:27:32] <ajpiano> ?mdc setAttribute @ bartmax
[14:27:32] <caniuse> ajpiano: element.setAttribute - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.setAttribute
[14:27:33] <bot-t1> bartmax, element.setAttribute - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Adds a new attribute or changes the value of an existing attribute on the specified element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.setAttribute
[14:27:48] <bartmax> ty ajpiano
[14:28:21] <ajpiano> bartmax: for class you cna just set elem.className = "whatevs"
[14:28:22] <raj> ajpiano, exactly, that was it
[14:28:23] <raj> :)
[14:28:26] <raj> thank you
[14:28:39] <bartmax> ajpiano: great
[14:29:17] <bartmax> ajpiano: chain is not an option in plain javascript right?? :D
[14:29:29] <ajpiano> that's a loaded question
[14:29:35] <a|3x> bartmax, raj:  $('input').val($(this).val() + 'x') puts x in every box and the original value is lost
[14:29:37] <raj> ajpiano, how does the click bubble to the document though? we've limited it to .file-list.single-file, no?
[14:29:49] <ajpiano> it's eminently possible to set up chaining in any sort of quote unquote "plain javascript"
[14:30:04] <bartmax> i see
[14:30:06] <amon293> bartmax: isn't working
[14:30:08] <ajpiano> bartmax: but by default most native dom element methods don't return the element so it's not chainable, per se
[14:30:25] <ajpiano> a|3x: $("input").val(function(i, val) {   return val + "x";  });
[14:30:31] <ajpiano> is what you wan
[14:30:55] <bartmax> i guess setAttribute doesn't return the element then :D
[14:31:33] <lopret> hi
[14:31:36] <raj> sorry about that a|3x
[14:31:50] <lopret> i have to ask about jquery datatables plugin
[14:32:20] <lopret> this plugin is not support colspan or rowspan
[14:32:33] <amon293> bartmax: http://jsfiddle.net/BXGE7/
[14:32:44] <lopret> how can i use div or span in table
[14:32:48] <a|3x> raj, np
[14:32:49] <lopret> or similar
[14:33:16] <ajpiano> raj:  it gets captured there, but then continues bubblin
[14:33:25] <ajpiano> raj: it only stops bubbling if we tell it to
[14:34:08] <someprimetime> what's the best way to remove all <li></li> tags from inside of a <ul> but maintain the content within them? e.g. <ul><li>foo</li><li>bar</li></ul> becomes <ul>foobar</ul>
[14:34:15] <raj> ajpiano, but .find goes inward, no?
[14:34:28] <ajpiano> raj: huh
[14:34:41] <raj> .find looks for children
[14:34:45] <raj> so document would be a parent
[14:34:46] <thomedy> thats an easy fix i think
[14:34:58] <ajpiano> every time anything is clicked, even one of the .singles, the second thing fires
[14:35:24] <ajpiano> so in the first handler, so you have to prevent the click from going any further up the dom and firing the second handler
[14:35:36] <amon293> can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/BXGE7/ i'm trying to make a fade in to an image but isn't working
[14:35:54] <redfox> someprimetime: this is not valid html, but you could iterate over every <li> with .each, concatinate the contents and then replace the content of the <ul>
[14:36:23] <someprimetime> redfox: word. i know it's not valid html though. i'm using this to add all the content into a textarea since it's for a style
[14:36:55] <redfox> someprimetime: why not add the contents to the textarea directly?
[14:37:02] <alket> Hi, I have two select list in one file, is there any way to update select list #2 by choosing an option to select list #1 ?
[14:37:45] <someprimetime> i'm basically showing a github view of the html code, and when the user clicks "raw" i'll convert everything within that <ul> into a textarea so they can just copy and paste the html directly
[14:37:52] <someprimetime> this is for an internal style guide
[14:38:00] <nveid> hrm fqzoom requires a bigger image?
[14:38:01] <someprimetime> $.each({}); should actually work fine for this
[14:38:04] <nveid> it can't do the zooming on its own?
[14:44:07] <k1ng> how do i do something like this?
[14:44:08] <k1ng> $.each($('form[nolog!="true"]'), function(k, v) { });
[14:44:20] <k1ng> i want do do $.each on every form
[14:45:36] <ajpiano> oh man
[14:45:38] <jeek_> do exactly that
[14:46:04] <ajpiano> $("form[nolog!='true']").each(function(i, el) { });
[14:46:21] <jeek_> yeah, and then make sure in the each function you do $(el)
[14:46:27] <k1ng> $('form[nolog!="true"]').each(function() { console.log($(this)) });
[14:46:30] <k1ng> yeah :D
[14:48:36] <amon293> it's possible to fade in an image from top to bottom??
[14:48:40] <nveid> i'd like to get this to work with prettyPhoto: http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/featuredzoomer.htm
[14:49:02] <nveid> But after I activate its zoom.. It doesn't work over the prettyPhoto.. Its only active when the prettyPhoto overlay isn't active
[14:54:18] <nveid> other than that.. featured zoom works perfectly without requiring a second image
[14:55:16] <nveid> i even set its z-index to :100000;
[14:55:29] <RoosterJuice> try 100002
[14:56:58] <nveid> ahh found issue.. I needed to set the zoomtracker z-index
[14:57:16] <nveid> the magnify area made it so it was over top.. but zoomtracker.. where you have teh mouse needed to have a z-index setting
[14:57:24] <mosdef100200> Hi there when animating left or right how do you stop it from going past a certain pint?
[14:57:58] <Zzaichik> I could use a pint..
[14:58:56] <nveid> hrm.. now the thing isn't going away when the prettyPhoto overlay is closed.. don't see a call to remove teh addzoomimage from a div
[14:59:52] <nveid> anyone see how to turn this off? http://pastebin.com/JKdQHYVW
[15:00:03] <RoosterJuice> how do you obtain an element's type?
[15:00:47] <RoosterJuice> like how do i find out if it's a dropdown, or an textbox
[15:01:34] <nveid> type
[15:01:40] <nveid> get the type attribute
[15:01:56] <nveid> $(selector).attr('type')
[15:02:09] <RoosterJuice> what about is()?
[15:02:19] <RoosterJuice> i guess 2 different functions
[15:02:21] <RoosterJuice> thanx
[15:02:21] <RoosterJuice> !
[15:02:25] <nveid> sure
[15:06:24] <k1ng> document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild("<scr" + "ipt type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js\"></scr" + "ipt>");
[15:06:28] <k1ng> any idea why its does not work?
[15:17:09] <nveid> got it.. running a remove() on all teh class elements it puts in
[15:23:53] <nveid> k.. so I got everything working peachy… one problem left, stupid featuredimage plugin scrollout doesn't work correctly
[15:30:19] <tarkus_> how can i escape some characters in query selector?
[15:30:43] <tarkus_> $('input[name^=trans[]')
[15:35:44] <BinaryKitten> use \
[15:35:48] <jonny> can you some help me with a little script
[15:36:06] <BinaryKitten> tarkus_ or even better give the input a class or ID
[15:36:13] <BinaryKitten> rather than using the name
[15:37:02] <raj> i've got a .bind({"change_state.jstree": function(e,d){}});, but if a certain button is clicked, I don't want it to hit the change_state function...can I do that with e.preventDefault, or perhaps something else?
[15:37:46] <raj> even though it otherwise would if that button is clicked
[15:38:19] <BinaryKitten> raj  can you not use a .not
[15:38:24] <a|3x> ajpiano: $("input").val(function(i, val) {   return val + "x";  });  this solution is very nice but what i really need is $('div.datetimepicker').datetimepicker("setDate", $(this).find('input').val());  (beforeShow doesn't appear to be working in trentrichardson.com timepicker)
[15:38:28] <BinaryKitten> ?.not @ raj
[15:38:29] <bot-t1> raj, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:38:56] <raj> BinaryKitten, no, that button is checking items in jstree
[15:38:56] <jonny> if any one got some time can they help it its like 2 -5 lines i need help with
[15:39:18] <raj> and normally changing_state (by checking/unchecking) runs a certain function that i've defined
[15:39:26] <BinaryKitten> raj righjt
[15:39:28] <raj> howevre, if this one button is clicked, i don't want that function run
[15:39:32] <BinaryKitten> so what is the .bind on?
[15:39:36] <a|3x> i need something like this: $('div.datetimepicker').datetimepicker("setDate", $(this).find('input').val());  (beforeShow doesn't appear to be working in trentrichardson.com timepicker)
[15:39:48] <raj> a jquery tree object
[15:40:04] <BinaryKitten> oh
[15:40:16] <BinaryKitten> you want to optionally turn it off if a button is clicked
[15:40:17] <Zzaichik> Out with it, jonny.  What is it you need? You could create a working example in jsfiddle.net if you're that far along..
[15:40:27] <jonny> http://jsfiddle.net/MHNuR/
[15:40:33] <raj> yeah, if the select_all button is clicked
[15:40:35] <jonny> i got that but i want it to get the second
[15:40:37] <jonny> video
[15:40:44] <jonny> not the first one it gets
[15:40:47] <raj> cuz otherwise it runs it 10 times, if 10 items are checked
[15:41:03] <raj> and i just want it run once, which I can specify for the click handler of the button
[15:41:09] <raj> but i need the normal change_state not to run
[15:41:23] <jonny> if you remove
[15:41:24] <jonny> return false;
[15:41:25] <BinaryKitten> raj $('target').data('runstate', false);
[15:41:39] <jonny> it will be the second one down i want it to come up with
[15:41:47] <BinaryKitten> then in your event use if ($(this).data('runstate')) { ..... }
[15:42:05] <raj> what's .data() for?
[15:42:14] <raj> the data attribute?
[15:42:16] <BinaryKitten> it's for storing data on an item
[15:42:17] <raj> i don't get it
[15:42:25] <raj> what data is being stored?
[15:42:29] <PilotBob> I have a click handler on an img in a cell of a tr. I want to hide the tr that contains it but only if this isn't the last tr in the table. Currently I have $(this).closest("tr").hide() which works fine... how do I have the hide not do anything if it is the :last tr?
[15:42:29] <raj> and why is data being stored?
[15:42:39] <BinaryKitten> raj, pastebin your code
[15:42:45] <BinaryKitten> then i can show you properly
[15:43:42] <qom2> http://konst-teknik.se/about <- I wanna have a function much like the one they have here with the foot notes that shows up in the margin, what would be the easiest way to achieve something like this? (the text need to be align with the word vertically and appear in a fixed column width and place)
[15:45:56] <jonny> Zzaichik im be back in 10 mins
[15:46:26] <raj> BinaryKitten, http://paste.ofcode.org/3r55EuG7mJuTi2juJv5A5M
[15:46:39] <raj> BinaryKitten, sorry
[15:46:40] <raj> that's wrong
[15:46:44] <raj> copied wrong page
[15:46:52] <Zzaichik> jonny: Sorry, I'm about to leave for the day. good luck!
[15:47:01] <BinaryKitten> raj no worries
[15:47:10] * BinaryKitten works on her plugin some more
[15:47:26] <jonny> ow ok
[15:47:27] <jonny> bye
[15:47:34] <ajpiano> a|3x: just use $(".datetimepicker").each(function() { $(this).datetimepicker("setTime", $(this).find("input").val());    });
[15:47:40] <raj> BinaryKitten, http://paste.ofcode.org/gKRvwtHTqg4cge2dQiageU
[15:47:46] <ajpiano> a|3x: the .val solution i gave you is just an "implicit iterator"
[15:48:02] <ajpiano> so that you get a loop for each one, which ultimately is what you need and what simply using each will give you
[15:48:39] <raj> if check_all or uncheck_all are clicked, I don't want change_state tree to run, which it normally would
[15:48:48] <BinaryKitten> raj no worries
[15:48:58] <raj> (change_state will run additionally for each item that's checked/unchecked)
[15:49:15] <PilotBob> oh never mind... probably just better to hide the delete button on the last row with CSS so it can't be clicked.
[15:54:15] <raj> any ideas BinaryKitten ?
[15:54:21] <BinaryKitten> yep raj
[15:54:28] <BinaryKitten> just running through lint and clean up
[15:54:33] <raj> ah, ok, gracias
[15:54:46] <raj> hopefully i don't have to dismantle too much of what I currently have
[15:55:41] <BinaryKitten> raj http://jsfiddle.net/f6u66/2/
[15:56:40] <BinaryKitten> you had a few issues in you code. namely extra commas, }; <-  the semi colon isn't needed   AND you had the functions being called before being defined
[15:57:29] <BinaryKitten> but the additions I made were to add the .data to store the flag 'event_on'
[15:57:37] <raj> so that's the only way
[15:57:37] <BinaryKitten> it then gets checked in the event
[15:57:45] <raj> there's no way to prevent what would otherwise happen using a method
[15:58:02] <BinaryKitten> raj .... using a method?
[15:58:22] <raj> something like e.preventPropagation or preventDefault
[15:59:16] <BinaryKitten> raj no. and even if you could   how would you know when to call that in the method
[15:59:32] <raj> no clue
[15:59:39] <raj> k, let me put in your stuff, un momento
[15:59:47] <BinaryKitten> raj only issue
[15:59:57] <BinaryKitten> is I'm not sure how to turn the event back on
[16:00:04] <BinaryKitten> there is an alternative here
[16:00:09] <raj> not sure
[16:03:14] <raj> oh, there 'is' an alternative, i read that as though you were asking me :)
[16:03:24] <BinaryKitten> yep
[16:03:30] <BinaryKitten> unbind/bind combo
[16:03:41] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/f6u66/3/
[16:04:05] <BinaryKitten> ah urm wait a sec
[16:04:54] <BinaryKitten> raj http://jsfiddle.net/f6u66/4/
[16:05:08] <tarkus_> $("input[name=trans\[0\].text]") produces: unrecognized expression: [name=trans[0].text]
[16:05:13] <BinaryKitten> sorry needed to move that function otherwise the treeclass wasn't in scope
[16:05:21] <raj> BinaryKitten, you know what I just realized, I need it to run after the last checkbox has been checked, so that it posts with the correct data
[16:05:38] <BinaryKitten> raj lols
[16:05:42] <raj> otherwise it'll just post with the first checkbox checked, and not the 9 others
[16:06:08] <raj> so I need to unbind ("check_all") from change_state
[16:06:27] <BinaryKitten> raj ??
[16:06:30] <diegoviola> hi
[16:06:46] <raj> BinaryKitten, you do know what I mean though, no?
[16:07:15] <BinaryKitten> raj on "run after last" yes ... to "so I need to unbind ("check_all") from change_state"  no
[16:07:16] <jonny__> can any one help me as i only what the second video two load not first or any of the others just the second one
[16:07:17] <jonny__> http://jsfiddle.net/MHNuR/1/
[16:07:50] <raj> so $('.colors').jstree("check_all") doesn't get recognized by change_state event
[16:07:57] <raj> BinaryKitten ^^
[16:08:24] <BinaryKitten> raj yep.. the event has nothing attached
[16:08:37] <BinaryKitten> we unbind the event, then check everything, then rebind the event
[16:08:37] <diegoviola> i have a map in png format as a background image in a div, i need to draw some vectors on top of it and make it highlight when i hover my mouse pointer on top of it and display info, any ideas what i can use for this? thanks
[16:09:20] <raj> oh, nice, so you're doing just that =P
[16:09:24] <raj> sorry, i jumped the gun
[16:09:33] <raj> ok, let me punch this in and see how it fairs
[16:10:06] <BinaryKitten> jonny
[16:10:12] <jonny> yes
[16:10:14] <BinaryKitten> how about images?
[16:10:25] <jonny> what
[16:10:26] <jonny> ??
[16:10:31] <BinaryKitten> instead of the videos?
[16:10:33] <jonny> thier youtube embeded
[16:10:42] <jonny> no it needs ot be like that
[16:10:50] <BinaryKitten> then you can't stop them loading
[16:10:52] <jonny> just need the second video to show
[16:10:59] <BinaryKitten> then only show the 2nd one
[16:10:59] <jonny> no wait
[16:11:04] <BinaryKitten> dont each,
[16:11:05] <jonny> wait
[16:11:22] * BinaryKitten waits
[16:11:39] <jonny> thttp://jsfiddle.net/MHNuR/2/
[16:11:46] <jonny> ok see now it only shows first
[16:12:02] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[16:12:03] <jonny> by adding return false
[16:12:15] <BinaryKitten> that only shows the 1st
[16:12:21] <jonny> yes
[16:12:28] <BinaryKitten> that's still bad
[16:12:36] <jonny> why is it
[16:12:50] <BinaryKitten> because you're looping over the items for no real reason
[16:13:03] <raj> BinaryKitten, changeEvent doesn't have to be passed `treeclass` ?
[16:13:09] <raj> so it can use it within the function?
[16:13:21] <jonny> can you help me with it
[16:13:26] <BinaryKitten> raj are you on /4/ ?
[16:13:31] <raj> oh, no
[16:13:37] <BinaryKitten> jonny yep doing so

[16:20:48] <BinaryKitten> also added a check in incase the feed only has 1 item
[16:20:49] <jonny> thanks
[16:21:05] <BinaryKitten> also PLEASE use var
[16:21:12] <jonny> ow ok
[16:21:14] <BinaryKitten> and declare your variables
[16:21:15] <jonny> :D
[16:21:28] <BinaryKitten> if you don't they jump up to the window scope
[16:21:35] <jonny> ok
[16:21:41] <BinaryKitten> and can interfere with stuff as well as be interfered with :)#
[16:22:02] <jonny> also how do i now make it so it now shows the first video
[16:22:20] <jonny> get ride of the if
[16:22:26] <jonny> well the second one
[16:22:28] <jonny> or?
[16:22:32] <BinaryKitten> ??
[16:22:36] <jonny> wait
[16:23:58] <jonny> can i know make it so the first video shows up in a new div box so it shows the first and second one
[16:24:07] <jonny> but in different div boxes
[16:24:46] <jonny> so like two div tags
[16:25:00] <jonny> and then first video in one and the second in the other
[16:25:05] <jonny> ill give it ago first
[16:25:06] <jonny> wait
[16:25:19] * BinaryKitten is working on something
[16:25:23] <BinaryKitten> give me a mo
[16:25:27] <jonny> ok
[16:26:24] <raj> BinaryKitten, it doesn't work...but I think if we can pull changeEvent function definition out of buildtree it'll work
[16:26:33] <BinaryKitten> raj
[16:26:39] <BinaryKitten> did you put the var in as well?
[16:26:43] <raj> yeah
[16:26:54] <BinaryKitten> hmm
[16:27:17] <BinaryKitten> you'll have to rewrite the changeEvent so it has the class..
[16:27:24] <BinaryKitten> or just process the stuff different
[16:27:48] <raj> yeah, I think that makes most sense to just pass the class to it
[16:28:34] <raj> do i just define it as `changeEvent function(e,data,treeclass){` ?
[16:28:47] <BinaryKitten> function changeEvent(e....
[16:29:01] <raj> yes, besides my dislexia
[16:29:05] <raj> dyslexia
[16:29:27] <raj> and then call it with changeEvent(treeclass)
[16:30:08] <BinaryKitten> raj noooooo
[16:30:13] <BinaryKitten> you don't call it
[16:30:17] <raj> oh
[16:30:24] <BinaryKitten> you need to pass it as the event function
[16:30:37] <raj> right
[16:30:43] <raj> but I need treeclass to go with it, no?
[16:30:50] <raj> when I provide it as the callback
[16:31:08] <BinaryKitten> precisely
[16:31:13] <BinaryKitten> raj give me a moment
[16:31:22] <BinaryKitten> currently updating jonny's code
[16:31:26] <BinaryKitten> then i can think straight for you
[16:31:37] <diegoviola> what can i use to draw vectors/places on top of maps and display info, etc?
[16:31:38] <raj> tree.unbind('change_state.jstree').jstree('check_all').bind('change_state.jstree', changeEvent(treeclass))

[17:03:39] <jonny> ill just have to keep making new .js file all the time
[17:03:44] <BinaryKitten> when you are calling updateVideos there
[17:03:47] <jonny> for other channel

[17:04:44] <BinaryKitten> http://pastebin.com/G58NR2iQ
[17:05:11] <BinaryKitten> you might want to switch the numbers too jonny
[17:05:21] <jonny> ok
[17:05:25] <BinaryKitten> eg if you want the 1st item 1st, pass 1 instead of 2
[17:05:35] <jonny> ye

[17:05:42] <BinaryKitten> eg you can put 6
[17:05:46] <BinaryKitten> and it will show the 6th
[17:06:32] <BinaryKitten> i'm guessing the updateVideos is in the youtube.js jonny?
[17:06:44] <jonny> the
[17:06:46] <jonny> the script
[17:06:46] <jonny> ye

[17:22:55] <KuroiIeWa5Da> I'm having a bit of trouble with the jQuery UI's CSS framework
[17:57:47] <raj> I have this code http://paste.ofcode.org/gKRvwtHTqg4cge2dQiageU , but check_all is making change_state's function run an additional time for each item checked. I just wanted check_all to run change_state once
[17:57:51] <raj> how can I do this??
[17:58:27] <Whirl3d> anybody know how to make a persistent lazy jquery object class?
[18:01:23] <marcusb> hi. does this look like a sane way to do a deep path resolution and stash away the resulting two td elements for later use, or is there a smarter way? thanks!   var row = this.children("table").eq(1).children("tbody").children("tr").eq(1).children("td");  var td1 = $(row.get(0)); var td2 = $(row.get(1));
[18:02:26] <Whirl3d> can you assing a class to your the rows you want and then select them by class?

[18:47:03] <Druid_> gna?
[18:47:26] <youngin> Druid_: come again
[18:48:09] <Druid_> GNA!
[18:48:44] <youngin> Druid_: then leave, come again later
[18:48:54] <youngin> if you don't wanna make yourself understood
[18:51:30] <Druid_> well
[18:51:45] <Druid_> currently low level formatting some sas drives from 520 to 512 bytes
[18:58:28] <munozca> Can anyone tell me why this will not work: $('.throughputRow' + '#' + $(this).attr('id')),
[18:59:00] <systemfault> missing a space between the two?
[18:59:20] <systemfault> '.throughputRow' becomes '.throughputRow '
[18:59:47] <systemfault> That doesn't make a lot of sense anyway...
[19:00:16] <systemfault> IDs are unique on the page so '#' + $(this).attr('id') should be enough
[19:01:16] <BinaryKitten> also why would you dom query for the item you have in $(this)
[19:11:08] <ITrace> Is it possible to trigger a function on a links :active state?

[19:38:15] <xp_prg> hi all is there a good way to do nice notifications to a user with jquery ui?
[19:39:24] <kborchers> xp_prg: notifications? you mean like a dialog? see ?dialog
[19:39:25] <bot-t1> xp_prg, UI/API/1.8/Dialog - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Dialog Overview A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Dialog
[19:39:27] <youngin> xp_prg: i think its more the work of your framework to do notifications
[19:39:46] <youngin> then you use jquery to make them real nice and cool, like sliding out after N seconds or what not
[19:39:59] <xp_prg> something like this: http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/jNotify
[19:40:02] <youngin> xp_prg: like http://soundcloud.com/brownswood/kutmah-worldwide-family-vol-2
[19:41:14] <xp_prg> so no opinions?
[19:46:54] <MistuhKurtz> xp_prg, there's a jquery plugin that does growl-style notifications
[19:46:57] <MistuhKurtz> idk about jquery ui though.
[19:58:44] <kborchers> xp_prg: fyi, UI does not have anything like that. we are working on Popup which could probably be used for something like that (http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/39506002/Popup) but it has been pushed from 1.9 on the Roadmap so probably not until 1.10 which is way out
[19:59:37] <xp_prg> ok just curious
[20:00:00] <xp_prg> do you have any recommendations on the best jquery notification plugin, like jgrowl, purr, jnotify etc... ?
[20:01:07] <kborchers> xp_prg: not personally, no. sorry. when ever i've had to do any notification type things, I usually just roll my own and do something simple.
[20:01:40] <xp_prg> ok just wondering :>
[20:46:01] <kcarriedo> need some help using $.ajax with jsonp and I keep getting SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':' in my json response
[20:46:16] <kcarriedo> I'm unable to parse the data can someone please help?
[20:51:15] <fulcan> I am trying to implement a jquery slideshow and it has annoying white background that I cannot change to black. It must be in the script but not sure what to change/add? Would appreciate a pointer!  :)  http://jsfiddle.net/guHLa/
[20:56:50] <delaney> is there anywhere i can download jqueryui 1.9 built?  i'm on windows and the Ant build script doesn't work here.
[20:58:38] <kborchers> delaney: you can get the latest milestone (1.9M6) here http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/09/jquery-ui-1-9-milestone-6-spinner-2/
[20:59:53] <kborchers> delaney: that is the last milestone, if you want to test the bleeding edge latest, you can use http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js and grab the CSS yourself from the repo
[21:00:02] <fulcan> I am trying to implement a jquery slideshow and it has annoying white background that I cannot change to black. It must be in the script but not sure what to change/add? Would appreciate a pointer!  :)  http://jsfiddle.net/guHLa/
[21:00:13] <valenn_> need some help using $.ajax with jsonp and I keep getting SyntaxError: Unexpected token ':' in my json response
[21:00:25] <kborchers> delaney: do not use the second link in production! it changes frequently
[21:00:42] <kborchers> you prob shouldn't use 1.9 M6 in prod either
[21:00:49] <kborchers> but it should be pretty stable
[21:06:08] <delaney> kborchers: i'm doing a test and wanted to do a toolbar with menus, should i use another menu plugin for now?
[21:07:52] <kborchers> delaney: not trying to tease you but do you mean like this? http://view.jqueryui.com/menubar/demos/menubar/default.html
[21:08:46] <delaney> kborchers: yep pretty much, 1.9 is the 'right way' to do that no?
[21:09:10] <kborchers> delaney: unfortunately that was split out into its own branch and won't be in 1.9
[21:09:40] * delaney sighs
[21:09:55] <kborchers> if you view the source of that example, you can see each file that you would need to include. just pull a copy of the menubar branch and include the files separately like that example and you should be fine
[21:10:11] <kborchers> it's not ready for production but that should get you through your test
[21:13:34] <LordThumper> Hi
[21:13:49] <LordThumper> in onclick="foo();bar()"
[21:14:02] <LordThumper> How do I stop the execution if foo() returns false?
[21:15:28] <foo> LordThumper: could you put bar() inside of me() and just have a conditional return if false? (which would prevent bar from executing)
[21:15:59] <LordThumper> Unfortunately I cannot do that
[21:16:15] <LordThumper> bar() is being attached by an Asp.net control renderer
[21:16:30] <foo> LordThumper: Then don't use foo() as an example. You no longer have the right to use my name. I'm sorry, but foo() is flexible.
[21:16:31] <LordThumper> And cannot modify without plenty of work
[21:16:45] <foo> LordThumper: ;)
[21:16:47] <LordThumper> :)
[21:16:54] <LordThumper> hehe
[21:16:56] <foo> LordThumper: Hmm, actually not sure on that, sorry.
[21:17:00] <LordThumper> Ah np
[21:17:17] <LordThumper> Tried "onclick='return foo; bar;'" but that obviously didn't work
[21:41:53] <coldhead> hey schnoodles
[21:53:58] <donCams> tell me. why should i use (function($){})(jQuery) or jQuery(function($){}) rather than $(document).ready(function(){}) ?
[21:55:53] <coldhead> donCams: the other forms are good if $ is being used by another library
[21:56:14] <coldhead> it lets you make $ === jQuery within that code, for you convenience
[21:56:22] <coldhead> your*
[21:56:38] <coldhead> and it won't upset the other lib
[21:57:00] <coldhead> http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries
[21:57:25] <donCams> cool. thanks coldhead
[22:09:56] <Christophe_v_e> Hi, I'd like to check if any of the parents equals SOMETHING .. if so add a class to the element - I'm not certain how I'd use .parents() to do this.
[22:11:28] <bdc> remedial question:  var foo = $(a).append(b);  // The selection $(foo) == $(a).  How do I get a reference to b?
[22:14:09] <bdc> Christophe_v_e: $(whatever).parents().each(callback) ?
[22:15:47] <Christophe_v_e> I don't think so - I really just need it to check if it has a parent somewhere named "portfolio-entry", if so continue .. rather than get each of these
[22:17:06] <Shazer[2]> ajpiano.
[22:17:09] <bdc> What do you mean by named?  (A class name? The text value of the node?)
[22:17:47] <Christophe_v_e> Classname
[22:17:55] <Christophe_v_e> Thanks for taking interest by the way :)
[22:18:19] <bdc> heh, no prob, might as well while I wait and see if anyone answers my question :)
[22:18:31] <Christophe_v_e> If my div has a parent, somewhere with the .portfolio-entry class I want to do something
[22:19:43] <Christophe_v_e> I was thinking something along the lines of: if(jQuery(this).closest(div.portfolio_entry)) do something
[22:19:46] <bdc> Can you do something like $(whatever).parents().hasClass('portfolio-entry').each(function() { … });
[22:20:08] <Christophe_v_e> I think the .parents doesn't need the hasClass, no?
[22:21:22] <bdc> My example was wrong, disregard that.
[22:23:39] <bdc> if ($(myDiv).parents().hasClass('portfolio-entry')) { /* do something */ }
[22:23:45] <bdc> I think that is what you want.
[22:25:48] <Christophe_v_e> Right on, it works
[22:25:49] <Christophe_v_e> Thanks man
[22:25:50] <php_on_rails> hello
[22:26:02] <php_on_rails> what is up????
[22:26:14] <php_on_rails> i am trying to get my firefox 3d to work… it isn't happening
[22:26:15] <bdc> cool, glad to help!
[22:26:15] <smplstk> hi
[22:26:15] <php_on_rails> how do I do it?
[22:26:32] <php_on_rails> did u guys get ur browsers in 3d?
[22:27:53] <bdc> Sure. Mine has width, height and a history… so that's 3 dimensions.  I've been had 3d since the early 90s.
[22:28:04] <php_on_rails> lol
[22:28:38] <coldhead> bot-t1: tell schnoodles I will never forget you
[22:28:38] <php_on_rails> i need help converting this jquery plugin to php
[22:28:38] <bot-t1> coldhead, Okay.
[22:29:41] <bdc> (don't mean to spam my q, but new people have joined) remedial question:  var foo = $(a).append(b);  // The selection $(foo) == $(a).  How do I get a reference to b?
[22:32:31] <coldhead> it depends on what b is, bdc
[22:32:38] <vladikoff> is b bdc?
[22:32:56] <vladikoff> php_on_rails, use the jquery-to-php converter
[22:32:59] <coldhead> if it's already a bona fide element you can just keep referring to b: $(b).hide()
[22:33:06] <bdc> var foo = $('body').append('<div>');
[22:33:18] <coldhead> foo.find('div:last')
[22:33:24] <bdc> oo
[22:33:59] <bdc> great idea coldhead, I think that will do it.
[22:34:42] <tw2113> stop giving people great ideas coldhead
[22:34:49] <tw2113> you're supposed to reserve them for me
[22:35:28] <coldhead> tw2113: my only idea for you is to tell people how much they mean to you while you have the chance
[22:35:28] <coldhead>  
[22:35:35] <coldhead> because who knows what tomorrow will bring
[22:35:49] <coldhead> whatever it is, it will probably be awful
[22:35:53] <tw2113> doh!
[22:36:08] <coldhead> great to see you again, schnoodles
[22:36:17] <coldhead> welcome back
[22:37:11] <Shazer[2]> hey coldhead
[22:37:18] <Shazer[2]> what's up?
[22:39:24] <coldhead> nothing good, Shazer[2]

[22:46:55] <Shazer[2]> Bored.
[22:49:58] <coldhead> Shazer[2]: any interest in the videos and slides that came out of SXSW?
[22:50:08] <coldhead> some interestingish stuff there supposedly
[22:56:16] <Shazer[2]> coldhead, what is SXSW?
[22:56:58] <coldhead> big festival/conference they just held in austin
[22:58:20] <Shazer[2]> Ah cool coldhead.

[23:02:01] <coldhead> Shazer[2]: http://coldhead.miketaylr.com/
[23:02:07] <coldhead> it's under construction
[23:03:14] <Shazer[2]> This isn't serious is it, coldhead.
[23:03:28] <coldhead> it's as serious as i am gonna get
[23:03:37] <coldhead> i resent your accusation
[23:03:41] <Shazer[2]> :P
[23:03:44] <Shazer[2]> Is your name Paul Irish?
[23:05:57] <coldhead> i wish, that guy is a total dream boat
[23:06:20] <coldhead>  /whois paul_irish <-- that guy  is paul_irish
[23:11:17] <Shazer[2]> coldhead, I looked up coldhead jquery on Google, and his name appeared. :P
[23:11:24] <coldhead> weird
[23:24:48] <thirdender> Just put jQuery plugin to replace SELECTs with styled HTML on github... would welcome any comments: https://github.com/thirdender/dropdown
[23:27:03] <coldhead> this is very very pretty thirdender
[23:27:14] <thirdender> coldhead: cool, thanks :-p
[23:27:18] <coldhead> and anything i was going to try suggesting is already on your todo list :D
[23:27:26] <coldhead> so do those things
[23:28:21] <Whirl3d> I noticed on Paul_irish's blog that he had captured a chat between hiimself, a couple of regular big hitters on #jquery and one peculiar user named: headcold...
[23:28:29] <Whirl3d> I thought...hmmm
[23:29:10] <thirdender> coldhead: sweet :-p
[23:29:19] <coldhead> that sounds very unlikely Whirl3d
[23:32:28] <dr0id> http://uniformjs.com/
[23:32:38] <Whirl3d> Yeah, it was ajpiano, Paul Irish, headcold and a couple of others...

[23:33:22] <abjorn> sup
[23:33:42] <coldhead> hey abjsy
[23:37:05] <abjorn> t'was a fun week of frolicking and frantically finishing projects and fixing things that were pushed into production all broken-like
[23:38:27] <coldhead> that's the best way to find bugs
[23:38:30] <coldhead> in productions
[23:38:35] <coldhead> where they matter
[23:40:38] <abjorn> I don't think I've ever seen coldhead actually leave the channel...so that's his quit message...
[23:44:24] <TylerWhitney> jquery even works to replace flash!
[23:45:01] <abjorn> weeeeellll
[23:45:11] <abjorn> I don't know about thaaaaatt
[23:45:54] <TylerWhitney> okay maybe not entirely, but I have a client who I made a pristine site for and wanted me to butcher it as usual with flashy shit and moving things
[23:46:15] <TylerWhitney> the quote I gave him was too littel for me to hire a flash dev or get my graphics guys on it... so I told him Id see what I could do within his price range
[23:46:18] <TylerWhitney> http://www.plattsburghauto.com/dev/
[23:46:48] <abjorn> I suppose you can replace animations with it, but idk about doing complex animations lol
[23:46:59] <TylerWhitney> lol yeah, but for my purposes that worked great
[23:47:13] <abjorn> yeah i'd never suggest flash for...like..anything.
[23:47:41] <TylerWhitney> I opted to make the car hide behind a div because it would be stupid to stay there
[23:48:08] <abjorn> lol that just looks siiiilllyyy
[23:48:13] <TylerWhitney> lol
[23:48:14] <abjorn> siillly cliieenttss
[23:48:30] <TylerWhitney> the top banner before was WAYY better
[23:48:44] <TylerWhitney> he wants to "draw attention" lmfao
[23:48:47] <TylerWhitney> whatever, they're paying me
[23:48:50] <abjorn> lol hook me up with that chrysler for $15,000
[23:49:09] <TylerWhitney> unfortunately these prices are just fake, I copied pasted 15000 in for all, lol
[23:49:33] <TylerWhitney> do you live in Plattsburgh?
[23:49:36] <TylerWhitney> or nearby?
[23:49:41] <abjorn> not even close
[23:49:57] <TylerWhitney> ...ok then I can say this without a guilt conscience; these cars are crap
[23:50:04] <abjorn> :D
[23:50:13] <abjorn> SHOW ME THE CARFAX
[23:50:16] <TylerWhitney> lol
[23:50:36] <TylerWhitney> to be honest, a couple of them aren't bad, but the ones that aren't bad they are asking way too much for
[23:50:50] <TylerWhitney> silly little car company, guy owns a Ford dealer and sends all his trade ins to this place
[23:51:13] <TylerWhitney> but keeps the link between them completely separate so people don't know this crap place is affiliated with his well-known Ford dealer
[23:51:57] <TylerWhitney> I ran across this earlier... you might change your mind about jQuery not doing complex animations: http://spritely.net/
[23:52:25] <abjorn> oh it CAN
[23:52:35] <abjorn> it's just
[23:52:41] <TylerWhitney> well that makes it a bit easier
[23:52:45] <abjorn> logistically it's not that feasible to do movies like you can in flash
[23:52:56] <abjorn> cartoons, that kind of thing
[23:53:18] <abjorn> mostly just because no tools exist for generating the large set of instructions it'd take
[23:53:26] <abjorn> although adobe is making one, i suppose
[23:53:28] <smares> I assume no jquery function can convert a string with key/value pairs to an object, right?
[23:53:28] <TylerWhitney> yeah, Im not sure, I think HTML5/CSS3/JS will kill Flash eventually
[23:53:44] <abjorn> what format, smares
[23:53:51] <TylerWhitney> smares: what delimiter?
[23:54:23] <smares> something like "items=3|total=50|tax=5|shipping=5|currency=EUR"
[23:54:32] <abjorn> no but that's simple enough to do
[23:55:02] <TylerWhitney> is it absolutely necessary to do in JS or could you do it server side? Depending on the amount of data it may be faster
[23:55:14] <smares> for something like { items: 3, total: 50, tax: 5, shipping: 5, currency: 'EUR' }
[23:55:18] <smares> js :(
[23:55:32] <smares> and that's the format I get from an external API
[23:55:36] <smares> wondering why they don't use json
[23:56:04] <TylerWhitney> weird man
[23:56:06] <TylerWhitney> try split
[23:56:09] <TylerWhitney> var exploded = str.split('|');
[23:56:14] <smares> yeah, I know
[23:56:28] <TylerWhitney> loop through that array and split again by =
[23:56:29] <smares> thought jquery might have something to ease things up :D
[23:56:52] <abjorn> smares: https://gist.github.com/2055901
[23:57:14] <abjorn> ahhh split...i love split
[23:57:20] <TylerWhitney> EXACTLY
[23:57:28] <abjorn> split and join <3
[23:57:31] <TylerWhitney> perfect abjorn
[23:58:18] <abjorn> I do believe jQuery has a function for parsing query string style, though
[23:58:20] <abjorn> iirc
[23:58:34] <abjorn> items=3&total=50 etc etc
[23:58:45] <abjorn> but faster to just do that
[23:59:53] <TylerWhitney> or str.replace('|','&'); for query string
