[00:02:19] <MalSim> hi everyone
[00:03:19] <jay_> why diverdude
[00:04:08] <MalSim> does any know how to trigger a fadeIn/fadeOut animation with onClick?
[00:04:17] <diverdude> jay_, because distinct is an aggregate function
[00:04:18] <MalSim> i cant seem to get it right'
[00:05:17] <MalSim> anyone
[00:05:30] <killer`toaster> MalSim: $(selector).click(function() { $('this').fadeIn(); });
[00:05:59] <killer`toaster> I meant fadeOut, but you get the point :p
[00:06:00] <MalSim> $( '.lights' ).fadeOut( 800 ).fadeIn( 200 );
[00:06:22] <killer`toaster> that looks about right
[00:06:25] <MalSim> i made this function to make a png fade in and out on a button click
[00:06:37] <MalSim> kool man
[00:06:43] <MalSim> let me try that
[00:07:40] <jay_> what is the command to send u private msg to a particular online user?
[00:07:54] <diverdude> jay_, if you have a PK the rows are already distinct. what is your uniqueness criteria?
[00:08:06] <jay_> wait
[00:08:45] <jay_> mysql_query("select DISTINCT package_name, package_id (select * from tbl_package where destination='$destination') from tbl_package where destination='$destination'")
[00:08:57] <jay_> i m trying something like this
[00:08:58] <jay_> mysql_query("select DISTINCT package_name, package_id (select * from tbl_package where destination='$destination') from tbl_package where destination='$destination'")
[00:13:06] <diverdude> jay_, please no private posting
[00:14:41] <jay_> i dont know how to send msg only to u through irc?
[00:23:17] <jay_>  /msg diverdude got any solution?

[00:59:11] <nir0> hi guys
[01:01:06] <nir0> say, i've got $(function () {$('.someclass').somemethod()}), and then an element with .someclass is added by ajax call, so somemethod is not called for it
[01:01:42] <nir0> i need to handle appearing dom elements as well
[01:09:10] <diverdude> nir0, use .on(
[01:11:26] <nir0> diverdude: .on what? in more particular case, i've got many inputs added, and need to call .typeahead() [bootstrap's one] on input with class .autocomplete...
[01:12:24] <nir0> diverdude: i'll check this method..
[01:13:15] <diverdude> nir0, http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:17:47] <cauffe> anyone got any JQuery video tutorials they would recommend? I'm mostly coming from PERL/PHP
[01:22:46] <diverdude> cauffe, i think youtube has some :)
[01:23:20] <cauffe> thanks, but was looking for a full professional course if anyone knows of one worth while
[01:43:31] <aro> halp
[01:44:03] <aro> i have a table row with two checkboxes, if they click on the row - i want to select one of the checkboxes but not the other, but the other checkbox needs to be able to be clicked without triggering the other
[01:44:06] <aro> how do i dot hat
[01:52:18] <thujone> if you click on a checkbox, it will not click another checkbox... your question doesn't really make sense
[01:53:44] <aro> maybe you didnt listen to what i said
[01:53:46] <aro> if they click the row
[01:53:54] <aro> i want to trigger one of them to get selected
[01:53:57] <aro> without triggering the other
[01:54:51] <aro> i was quite clear
[01:56:06] <thujone> if you click on a checkbox, why would it ever trigger another checkbox?
[01:56:09] <thujone> not clear
[01:56:21] <thujone> create a <label> for one of them
[01:56:28] <thujone> the label can be the row
[01:56:34] <aro> if you click a checkbox it triggers a click on the row
[01:56:47] <thujone> it shouldn't
[01:56:56] <aro> well thats jquery for you
[01:57:05] <thujone> event.stopPropagation()
[01:57:13] <aro> doesnt work
[01:57:18] <aro> nor does stopImmediate
[01:57:43] <thujone> you should post some code then
[01:57:51] <aro> hang on
[01:58:25] <thujone> the <label> would work fine
[01:58:38] <thujone> you should probably use <label> for <input>s anyway
[02:00:50] <thujone> click on the label, it enters a check into your checkbox, no jquery required
[02:07:12] <fattest> http://jsfiddle.net/r3JZg/17/ how do i add html content in these tabs. pllease someone help!!!

[02:14:05] <aro> omg
[02:14:10] <aro> fattest are you retarded
[02:14:15] <fattest> ?
[02:14:17] <aro> you are authed
[02:14:18] <aro> we arent
[02:14:26] * Woet sighs
[02:14:26] <aro> you are not forbidden from accessing it
[02:14:27] <aro> we are
[02:14:31] <aro> moron
[02:14:36] <fattest> why r u guys forbidden?
[02:14:45] <Woet> aro: please don't use that kind of language
[02:14:57] <aro> what kind of language?
[02:14:58] <aro> moron?
[02:15:09] <Woet> aro: yes, the channel ops don't appreciate it.
[02:15:14] <aro> chanserv?
[02:15:19] <aro> i dont think he cares
[02:15:21] <fattest> woet: why are you guys forbidden?
[02:15:24] <aro> (hes a network bot)
[02:15:45] <aro> fattest: because we arent logged into your AWS service i assume
[02:15:59] <aro> and you have some kind of access restriction
[02:16:08] <fattest> aro: im not logged in either.
[02:16:15] <aro> then its an IP restriction
[02:16:18] <Woet> fattest: http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/ mentions which CDNs you can use.
[02:16:19] <fattest> ok
[02:16:42] <fattest> woet: http://knockoutjs.com/downloads/knockout-2.2.0.js
[02:17:20] <aro> idk why this fiddle works but breaks on my site
[02:17:33] <fattest> woet: do yo uget the same problem here http://jsfiddle.net/r3JZg/29/
[02:17:49] <Woet> aro: because the problem is elsewhere.
[02:18:01] <aro> woet: theres nothing else loaded
[02:18:05] <Woet> fattest: no, that works. what is the issue?
[02:18:07] <Woet> aro: apparently there is.
[02:18:12] <aro> one page gives me a maximum stack exceeded, the other doesnt
[02:18:15] <aro> woet: there isnt
[02:18:26] <fattest> woet: i want to add html content in the tabs. but its using the same text for all 3 tabs
[02:18:27] <Woet> aro: then you have discovered a rift in space and time
[02:18:42] <fattest> woet: "var fakeText = " - lorem ...."
[02:18:48] <Woet> aro: either that or there is a different between your fiddle and your site.
[02:18:52] <Woet> difference *
[02:19:04] <Woet> fattest: what else do you expect?
[02:19:17] <fattest> woet: how do i add html content in the tabs?
[02:19:32] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/t2ek3/14/
[02:19:38] <aro> now it doesnt work on the fiddle
[02:19:44] <aro> its between jquery 1.8.3 and 1.9.1
[02:19:59] <aro> so jquery 1.8.3 is broken
[02:20:09] <Woet> aro: so there is a difference! surprising.
[02:20:19] <aro> ?
[02:20:32] <Woet> fattest: "this.details" is not a jQuery function.
[02:20:49] <fattest> woet: i didn't write the fiddle. i found it online
[02:21:12] <Woet> fattest: okay, so go through the documentation of prototype / knockout and find your answer.
[02:21:29] <fattest> ok
[02:21:46] <Woet> fattest: i also recommend http://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[02:22:32] <Woet> aro: it's very well possible bugs were fixed between 1.8.3 and 1.9.1, yes
[03:20:27] <Guest75919> can anyone please create a fiddle Tab content, where it'll only load the tab if you click it? i found a bootstrap one, but it loads everything at once. http://jsfiddle.net/johnpapa/qSqpD/

[06:32:20] <dublin> Hi. I'm designing a web app that uses flexslider slide show.  Would like a library that when someone clicks on a photo it would open a full screen slide show on both mobile or desktop. Anyone have any suggestions, or know what that would be called?
[06:33:46] <f00f> dublin : see if the lightbox plugin does what you want
[06:34:08] <dublin> Thanks f00f â€¦ will have a look.
[06:36:54] <mintux1> is it possible to combine show and hide function with fadein effect ?
[06:52:08] <_dreamer> Hi, I have a button on my page wich I want to make execute a function when clicked. Basically I am trying to do this </script type="text/javascript">$(document).ready(function() { $('#button').click(function() { theFuctionIWantToRun() }); });</script>
[06:52:35] <_dreamer> Why this does not work I cannot get my head arround but perhaps you could enlighten me?
[06:53:10] <shoky> `demo @ _dreamer
[06:53:10] <b-ot> _dreamer: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:00:23] <mintux1> anybody knows why .alert('show') doesn't work here? http://jsfiddle.net/u8VUY/2/
[07:00:27] <_dreamer> http://jsfiddle.net/hEHxL/7/
[07:00:32] <_dreamer> thre u go
[07:03:21] <_dreamer> The point of the demo is running the function, not saying hello... :P
[07:07:50] <mintux1> how should i active buttons ?
[07:11:01] <shoky> mintux1: jquery objects don't have an .alert() function
[07:12:29] <shoky> oh, maybe bootstrap adds it, nevermind
[07:17:00] <mintux1> yeah right
[07:31:11] <ss23> Hi guys, might possibly be a bit of css too, but is there an easy change I can make to http://ss23.geek.nz/silverstripe/eats/SilverStripe-cms-v3.0.5/ to make the images slide rather than just replace? I suspect I'll have to change some stuff to a overflow:hidden? Any help/ideas/quickfixes?
[07:31:37] <_dreamer> why doesnt this work?
[07:31:39] <_dreamer> http://jsfiddle.net/hEHxL/7/
[07:32:02] <ss23> _dreamer: You didn't select the framework on jsfiddle
[07:32:30] <ss23> _dreamer: Use your browsers console. It would've said something like "$ not defined", which tells you jquery isn't working
[07:32:35] <ss23> _dreamer: http://jsfiddle.net/hEHxL/8/ fixes it
[07:33:48] <_dreamer> for some reason it does not work on my page although i run LOADS of other jquery commands
[07:34:02] <ss23> _dreamer: Well, it works on jsfiddle. What does your console say?
[07:34:35] <_dreamer> what console?
[07:35:24] <ss23> _dreamer: Your browsers console
[07:35:30] <ss23> The thing that tells you whenever you have errors
[07:37:06] <_dreamer> It says number is not a function
[07:37:16] <_dreamer> wich makes absolutley no sense at all
[07:38:03] <ss23> _dreamer: If you can link it to us, we can have a look, but it should give you a line number which can help you debug it yourself
[07:39:06] <_dreamer> (anonymous function) localhost:43 jQuery.event.dispatch jquery.js:3074 elemData.handle
[07:40:12] <_dreamer> I do not understand why it would be annonymous
[07:40:15] <ss23> _dreamer: Do you have a link so we can see for ourselves, if you can't reproduce on jsfiddle?
[07:40:45] <_dreamer> Oh shit
[07:41:07] <_dreamer> I forgot that javascript sucks and I already have a var called step and my functions name is step
[07:41:33] <_dreamer> havent fiddled with this for a while so I completley forgot
[07:41:38] <ss23> lol
[07:42:31] <_dreamer> lol
[07:42:38] <_dreamer> thx anyway, my bad
[07:43:30] <mk> I'd like some opinions on this code:
[07:45:28] <zissou> how do i get the computed font size for a browser?
[07:46:00] <mk> http://jsfiddle.net/fav6z/
[07:46:03] <mk> I'd like some opinions on this code:
[07:47:38] <mk> For example: is the animation properly set up, ajaxstart is really global, server side language provides error message
[07:55:07] <zissou> mk, in ajax dont use get, use post. and u arent sending any data.
[07:55:27] <zissou> and no need for logging... cause it will take about 50ms
[07:55:44] <zissou> this more like it  http://jsfiddle.net/fav6z/2/
[07:55:56] <shoky> why not get?
[07:56:27] <zissou> cause pass and username go in querystring?
[07:56:50] <zissou> id pass sensitive info in post
[07:57:49] <shoky> o i didn't notice it's a form submission
[07:58:48] <shoky> then.. to send the form data i'd go with  data: $(this).serialize()
[07:59:31] <shoky> donno how your eventdata argument helps (it's also used wrong)
[07:59:47] <ko2in> zissou: ajax don't use get ? by default it's using get method or am i missing something ?
[08:00:20] <zissou> ko2in, it was a suggestion for passing login form data
[08:00:40] <zissou> shoky, ye didnt test this. i just thought that would work.. =)
[08:01:08] <shoky> you're not even sending the actual form data , you just made up an "eventdata" from thin air ;p
[08:01:15] <zissou> i suppose that eventdata contains a json with names:values of input fields?
[08:01:26] <shoky> why would it
[08:01:45] <shoky> it doesn't contain anything , it's undefined
[08:01:51] <zissou> doesnt it say so here ? http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[08:02:12] <shoky> An object containing data that will be passed to the event handler.
[08:02:18] <shoky> it's up to you to pass that data
[08:02:36] <shoky> there's no need for that eventData param here, anyways
[08:02:46] <zissou> so first you have to pass forma data in that object?
[08:03:09] <shoky> you can if you really want to, but that's not really what it's for
[08:03:48] <shoky> $.ajax({ url: '...', data: $(this).serialize() })
[08:04:05] <shoky> type: 'post'  if you want
[08:04:56] <shoky> that is..  $('#loginForm').submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault();  $.ajax({ url: '...', data: $(this).serialize() })  })
[08:04:58] <zissou> .serialize will encode all object's values?
[08:05:19] <shoky> the form's inputs, yes
[08:06:25] <zissou> can it only be used on forms?
[08:07:12] <shoky> and form inputs
[08:07:40] <zissou> seems like form is kind of a special case in that that it implicitly contains data
[08:08:23] <shoky> it also implicitly submits itself if you press its' submit button. sure, it's special
[08:08:25] <zissou> cause of the attributes name and value.. from inputs
[08:08:53] <zissou> when u select it in jquery it passes to the object those properties
[08:09:04] <shoky> hm?
[08:10:21] <zissou> erm, nevermind...
[08:11:34] <zissou> shoky, can you help me out? im trying to find a browsers computed font-size
[08:11:56] <zissou> default for many browsers is 16px but that doesnt have to be so, right?
[08:15:32] <eltigre> hey, I need to override a widget in jquerymobile because it is incompatible with all internet explorers... how would I go about this best?
[08:15:42] <eltigre> I need to modify the widget's source...
[08:15:59] <shoky> zissou: http://kendsnyder.com/posts/browser-rendering-getting-computed-style-is-hard
[08:16:22] <shoky> zissou: or uhh, .css('font-size')  no good?
[08:18:49] <shoky> zissou:  http://jsbin.com/ifaquh/1/edit
[08:19:01] <zissou> shoky, tried .css just before u texted... works.. i thought that .css wouldnt work cause i didnt declare it explicitly... dont know why i write anything without testing first
[08:20:24] <zissou> but, if you zoom in, font-size gets bigger, yet it outputs 16px
[08:21:31] <zissou> ok, that is irrelevant in my case... tnx shoky

[10:00:37] <jrich> hey guys im tyring to screw around with hover()
[10:00:47] <jrich> $("btn1").hover(function () { $(this).css("background-color", "#08233e") }, function () { $(this).css("color", "blue") });
[10:01:02] <jrich> i realize its a mashup, but figured at least some part of that would work
[10:03:59] <jrich> found it :-/
[10:04:05] <jrich> stupid mistake, #btn1
[10:04:14] <mk> zissou, You were helping me with the login.
[10:04:46] <mk> As you might notice I am using GET for a test.txt file, not a server side file.
[10:05:50] <mk> "It will take about 50ms"   what if I'm on a slow server, wouldn't it be nice to have some sort of indication?
[10:09:47] <mk> Also is $(document).ajaxStart the default method for displaying a loading indicator?
[10:10:45] <mk> There isn't somethnig like .start() for $.ajax?
[10:11:49] <zissou> mk, you could use the beforesend option for ajax
[10:12:18] <jrich> and then use the $.ajax().done()
[10:12:49] <jrich> looking at the docs i dont see a "start"
[10:12:55] <jrich> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:13:03] <zissou> mk, also i was wrong about some of the ajax thing,, shoky cleared it up
[10:18:09] <Whirl3d> that's cause shoky rocks! All hail shoky!
[10:18:28] <houser> hail!
[10:21:28] <RabSimpson> hi folks, i'm trying to implement a small form validator but running into problems (it doesn't appear to work at all). the input should accept only a-zA-Z0-9 and spaces, but is accepting any character. could someone maybe have a look and tell me where i'm going wrong? much appreciated :D - http://www.sellyourcarscotland.co.uk/static/
[10:22:02] <RabSimpson> in case anyone is wondering, this is where i got the js from - http://www.dotnetfunda.com/forums/thread13580-how-to-validate-alpha-numeric-values-in-textbox-using-jquery.aspx
[10:22:47] <jrich> .match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/g))
[10:22:50] <jrich> that?
[10:23:18] <RabSimpson> what's wrong with it? i'm a bit new at this...
[10:23:34] <jrich> i just started yesterday :)
[10:23:43] <Whirl3d> lol
[10:23:46] * RabSimpson high 5 fellow n00b
[10:24:03] <jrich> lol
[10:24:11] <Whirl3d> I would suggest catching each keypress, validating it, then adding it only if it's valid.
[10:24:17] <jrich> ohhhh
[10:24:19] <jrich> yeah
[10:24:19] <jrich> so
[10:24:30] <jrich> this.value.match( /[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]/g
[10:24:33] <jrich> regex problem
[10:24:36] <jrich> you're doing it on the whole value
[10:24:41] <RabSimpson> ahhh
[10:24:46] <jrich> rather than per char
[10:24:52] <jrich> like the linked example
[10:24:57] <RabSimpson> isn't that what .keyup is for?
[10:25:07] <jrich> either is fine, but
[10:25:14] <jrich> you're looking at the whole value
[10:25:24] <jrich> it will look at the whole thing and say, is there a letter or number? sure
[10:25:38] <RabSimpson> so how would i do it on every keypress?
[10:25:41] <jrich> im guessing if you start with a special char it will fail
[10:25:47] <RabSimpson> nope, it works
[10:26:03] <RabSimpson> or rather, the script fails to do anything at all
[10:26:09] <RabSimpson> if i enter % it doesn't remove it
[10:26:44] <jrich> hmm
[10:26:51] <jrich> maybe you should use the read()
[10:26:57] <Whirl3d> RabSimpson, does this help: http://www.west-wind.com/weblog/posts/2011/Apr/22/Restricting-Input-in-HTML-Textboxes-to-Numeric-Values?
[10:27:00] <jrich> i see that EVERY where
[10:27:14] <RabSimpson> whirl3d: i'll give it a try!
[10:27:37] <Whirl3d> granted you will have to accommodate alpha characters, but it gives you a well commented explanation.
[10:27:50] <Whirl3d> regex would be better, but this gives you the idea to work with.
[10:28:29] <jrich> the code you linked
[10:28:31] <jrich> seems good
[10:28:32] <jrich> well
[10:28:34] <jrich> the post
[10:28:42] <RabSimpson> i'll need to work out which numbers would correspond to the alpha characters
[10:28:42] <jrich> devi's
[10:29:07] <RabSimpson> in the one i linked?
[10:29:12] <jrich> yeah
[10:29:25] <jrich> http://www.dotnetfunda.com/forums/thread13580-how-to-validate-alpha-numeric-values-in-textbox-using-jquery.aspx
[10:29:43] <RabSimpson> looking at devi's example
[10:30:11] <jrich> you dont need his points 1 and 2
[10:30:15] <jrich> but his code, you can take as is
[10:30:19] <RabSimpson> it appears to be broken - http://jsfiddle.net/syS4G/
[10:30:19] <jrich> and just replace the object
[10:30:31] <RabSimpson> i can enter special chars but not alphanumeric
[10:31:19] <houser> why is the canvas not registering a click? :( http://jsfiddle.net/Ae8Hj/5/
[10:32:24] <RabSimpson> jrich: how would i invert devi's example in the link i just posted?
[10:32:28] <jrich> lol so its a backeards regex
[10:32:32] <jrich> hold on testing
[10:32:41] <jrich> houser:  just a min :)
[10:32:42] <RabSimpson> :)
[10:33:14] <jrich> well
[10:33:17] <jrich> cuz of the if logic
[10:33:25] <jrich> if it matches a char/num then prevent
[10:33:29] <jrich> just need a not in there
[10:33:35] <houser> jrich, where?
[10:33:52] <jrich> houser:  finishing up helping RabSimpson, one min :)
[10:34:01] <houser> ohh i am sossorry
[10:34:19] <jrich> if(!pressedKey.match(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/g))
[10:34:26] <jrich> slap a ! in there RabSimpson
[10:34:29] <houser> i found the problem
[10:34:36] <jrich> so, if its not a number or letter, prevent it
[10:34:38] <RabSimpson> jrich: i was hoping it'd be as simple as adding a ! :D
[10:35:04] <jrich> im so new to this, i didnt even know about jsfiddle lol
[10:35:07] <jrich> thats a cool tool :)
[10:35:44] <jrich> ok houser on to you
[10:35:56] <RabSimpson> jrich: works like a charm :D thanks for your help!
[10:36:02] <jrich> welcome
[10:36:17] <houser> jrich, yeah i am trying to figure out how to position the 2 canvas on top of each other and the uncle below
[10:36:36] <jrich> im not sure i follow you
[10:37:23] <jrich> you've got some crazy things going on here
[10:37:36] <jrich> you have two css blocks defined for the same thing
[10:37:40] <jrich> with different pos rules
[10:37:50] <jrich> also, parent is probably bad
[10:38:02] <jrich> its a common keyword
[10:38:16] <houser> no parent is ok
[10:38:22] <jrich> ok
[10:38:29] <houser> and there has to be 2 canvas
[10:38:51] <jrich> right
[10:39:13] <jrich> so....
[10:39:20] <jrich> define the position of canvas
[10:39:27] <jrich> uncle will automatically be below
[10:39:34] <houser> i got it solved :) Like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Ae8Hj/14/
[10:39:38] <Whirl3d> does anybody know of a quick library that defines keycode constants to be accessed like KEY.fwdarrow that returns the keycode for the forward arrow?
[10:40:02] <jrich> oh, i was thinking you meant something else :)
[10:40:21] <jrich> Whirl3d:  in most languages there are shortcuts
[10:40:40] <Whirl3d> Sure. I'm looking for a js shortcut.
[10:40:43] <jrich> http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes
[10:41:29] <jrich> im surprised jquery doesnt create constants for that
[10:42:13] <Whirl3d> me too. I was just writing a simple plugin to do it ( prolly not necessary), but I was looking at Google's library.
[10:42:43] <jrich> you dont need a plugin, its just a hash
[10:42:52] <jrich> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1402698/binding-arrow-keys-in-js-jquery
[10:43:00] <jrich> arrow = {left: 37, up: 38, right: 39, down: 40 };
[10:43:15] <jrich> if(key == arrow.left)
[10:43:17] <Whirl3d> sure, I'm looking for the entire character set
[10:43:32] <jrich> well, you shouldnt need the int value there
[10:43:38] <Whirl3d> to add it to a restrictInput plugin, sorry, not jquery itself.
[10:44:12] <jrich> thats sorta what RabSimpson was working on, kinda
[10:44:18] <jrich> at least in the aspect of getting chars for most things
[10:44:29] <jrich> you only care about things like arrow keys for int's
[10:44:38] <Whirl3d> exactly. I was just thinking that I needed something similar and rather than deal with a special case, I would make it so it worked for all cases
[10:45:37] <jrich> i guess you could make a large hash
[10:45:41] <jrich> but im not sure that would be worth it
[10:46:03] <jrich> you could make a function that handles it, to help simplify it
[10:46:15] <Whirl3d> Basically, I want to be able to use the syntax: $("#myInput").restrictInput(someRegex) where I would have the possible characters (excluding the control registers) restricted by regex
[10:46:19] <jrich> is JS case sensitive?
[10:46:33] <Whirl3d> not sure.
[10:46:58] <jrich> it would by default skip contol keys i think?
[10:47:07] <jrich> hmm
[10:47:10] <Whirl3d> precisely.
[10:47:23] <Whirl3d> So I just need a hash for the control registers, I suppose.
[10:47:43] <jrich> you want to stop what?
[10:48:34] <Whirl3d> for example $("#myIN").restrict(\[a-z]\) to restrict  input to only characters in the set [a-z]
[10:48:48] <istvan> hello - On my site, click on two points in the canvas (white) to create a line. Then click on the line. The console shows the coords of your click, but another line is added too - I want to prevent that behavior. the listeners start on fractalcanvas.gen.js on line 163 (note: the js is hand written despite "gen") -- http://www.fractalcanvas.com/fractalcanvas.sfw.php
[10:48:52] <jrich> attach that to keydown
[10:48:53] <jrich> and it should work
[10:48:56] <Whirl3d> anything else (besides arrows, etc.) wouldn't register
[10:48:59] <Whirl3d> That's my plan.
[10:49:10] <Whirl3d> ding ding ding. On to the bonus round....
[10:49:26] <jrich> let me test something
[10:49:44] <jrich> hmm
[10:51:26] <jrich> stupid question, how do i set a label value?
[10:51:39] <jrich> $("#name").value = "hello"
[10:51:47] <jrich> i tried value and val
[10:51:54] <Whirl3d> How do you go from charCode or keyCode to char? I am drawing a blank.
[10:51:58] <Whirl3d> .text
[10:52:20] <Whirl3d> assuming #name is a label with id=name
[10:52:23] <jrich> right
[10:52:29] <jrich> http://jsfiddle.net/syS4G/
[10:52:43] <jrich> trying to track whats going on with keypress
[10:52:49] <jrich> by logging the code to the label
[10:52:52] <jrich> but my label isnt updating
[10:54:03] <jrich> is there a way to get this thing to work like google docs
[10:54:10] <jrich> where two people can edit it
[10:54:31] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/syS4G/5/
[10:55:08] <jrich> that doesnt show prevented keys tho :)
[10:56:18] <jrich> but its not much different from what i did... hmm
[10:58:23] <jrich> oh, method vs property
[10:58:24] <jrich> weird
[10:59:38] <jrich> hmm it doesnt capture special keys
[11:00:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/syS4G/7/
[11:01:00] <Whirl3d> it WAS what you did, I used your fiddle.
[11:01:02] <Whirl3d> fiddle.
[11:01:07] <Whirl3d> Changed two lines.
[11:01:32] <jrich> yeah you moved it inside the if
[11:01:45] <jrich> but all i needed was .text ="blah" to .text("blah")
[11:01:54] <jrich> i assumed text was a property
[11:01:55] <jrich> not a method
[11:02:03] <jrich> or maybe it is a property, and jquery is just weird :)
[11:02:32] <Whirl3d> well, the latest version appears to work to restrict characters based on a supplied regex
[11:02:36] <Whirl3d> testing now
[11:03:41] <jrich> im just trying to capture arrow keys :)
[11:05:10] <jrich> whats the $.fn. ?
[11:05:31] <Whirl3d> just look for keycode's relative to the arrow keys. Are you trying to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/vyJ43/
[11:06:17] <Whirl3d> Establishes a jquery method that can be applied to jquery objects. Like $(el).doSomething.....Clutters the jquery namespace and is frowned upon, though.
[11:06:44] <jrich> neat tho
[11:08:21] <JosephSilber> jrich: it's just an alias to jQuery.prototype
[11:08:55] <jrich> thanks
[11:12:07] <Whirl3d> JosephSiber, can you explain that better. I use it all the time, but never thought of it as an alias to jquery.prototype.
[11:12:28] <min|dvir|us> Anyone have any issues with $el.load(url) taking a very long time on Chrome sometimes?
[11:12:33] <Whirl3d> wait. you are saying $.fn is jquery.prototype. LOL sorry
[11:16:35] <JosephSilber> Whirl3d: what did you think I was refering to?
[11:21:29] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:21:39] <lenswipe> can someone tell me a way to pass messages between $.ajax callbacks?
[11:22:06] <min|dvir|us> lenswipe: pass messages in what way?
[11:22:22] <min|dvir|us> One ajax call to another, or have all the data from the ajax calls at some point?
[11:24:00] <min|dvir|us> Whirl3d: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L76
[11:31:04] <JosephSilber> min|dvir|us: pass your jqXHR objects (the ones returned from $.ajax/$.get/$.post etc.) to $.when: http://jsfiddle.net/uNTrw/
[11:31:29] <guy> hello, any clue why this doesn't work on iOS captive network support?
[11:31:30] <guy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cd7e701a1f6c74c808dc
[11:32:21] <JosephSilber> guy: why is that a sql file?
[11:32:34] <guy> sorry, wrong paste
[11:32:51] <guy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c0e286b7c9cefaf70cdd
[11:33:15] <JosephSilber> same thing
[11:33:42] <guy> oh. that's just syntax highlighter
[11:33:50] <lenswipe> min|dvir|us, between the success callback and the complete callback
[11:34:20] <min|dvir|us> lenswipe: use promises.
[11:35:32] <JosephSilber> lenswipe: min|dvir|us: pass your jqXHR objects (the ones returned from $.ajax/$.get/$.post etc.) to $.when: http://jsfiddle.net/uNTrw/
[11:35:53] <JosephSilber> min|dvir|us: sorry for including you in this. Mea culpa...
[11:40:14] <guy> anyone?
[11:42:19] <guy> it is clearly a bug...
[11:42:56] <jrich> i blame ios
[11:47:44] <jrich> so im playing with a jqueryui progress bar
[11:47:51] <jrich> how do i know what css properties i can screw with?
[11:51:39] <codephobic> hi
[11:54:18] <codephobic> I'm trying to access an anonymous array, within an object being returned through ajax. I just can't seem to figure out how... the ajax return object looks like follows: {"myRetrun": {"message":["this is a message"]}, "another prop":"something else"}
[11:56:12] <ravenzz> codephobic why the message is stored into an array?
[11:56:53] <codephobic> ravenzz, it's either going to store a string or a bunch of properties (if successful), so I made an array
[11:57:05] <min|dvir|us> codephobic: that's bad design.
[11:57:31] <codephobic> I was trying to write something that I could manipulate to include all the returned items or a string if nothing was returned.
[11:57:38] <min|dvir|us> "or a string"
[11:57:40] <ravenzz> codephobic usually a message is a string
[11:57:46] <min|dvir|us> Bad design. You should always have predictable JSON.
[11:57:54] <codephobic> k
[11:58:04] <ravenzz> you should change it if you can
[11:58:06] <codephobic> well, I guess I was being a little lazy
[11:58:18] <ravenzz> you definitely were
[11:58:20] <ravenzz> :)
[11:58:41] <codephobic> I can change it, but it looked like I should be able to just step into that anonymous array and pluck out the message anyhow
[11:58:52] <codephobic> I'm really curious as to why I can't just do that
[11:58:54] <min|dvir|us> codephobic: you sure can.
[11:58:57] <min|dvir|us> array[0]
[11:59:10] <codephobic> ah, just prefix it with "array"?
[11:59:14] <ravenzz> no
[11:59:27] <codephobic> hmm, then I'm lost
[11:59:37] <codephobic> I already tried array[0]
[11:59:43] <min|dvir|us> codephobic: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:59:45] <ravenzz> data.myReturn.message[0]
[12:01:03] <min|dvir|us> codephobic: the array is not anonymous.
[12:01:08] <codephobic> ravenzz, I tried that, but doesn't seem to work for me.
[12:01:22] <ravenzz> ?paste @ codephobic
[12:01:22] <bot-t1> codephobic, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:01:22] <b-ot> codephobic: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:01:41] <codephobic> one mo.
[12:02:22] <min|dvir|us> codephobic: if you're coming from PHP, "associative array" is PHP talk for "object". A regular array is not "anonymous".
[12:04:17] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i was here earlier asking about form validation for a single input for alphanumeric characters only, and i've run into a small snag. in firefox (os x, v20) it won't recognise the backspace key. any ideas? here's the page - http://www.sellyourcarscotland.co.uk/static/
[12:04:46] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: where in the source are you trying to recognize it?
[12:05:17] <RabSimpson> min|dvir|us: there's only one piece of jquery in the source, right near the top.
[12:05:45] <jrich> why isnt there a good site for info like msdn??
[12:05:54] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: use .keydown.
[12:05:58] <jrich> the jquery docs make no sense to me
[12:06:12] <min|dvir|us> jrich: can I help you understand something?
[12:06:20] <jrich> all of it :)
[12:06:24] <jrich> im just screwing around
[12:06:28] <jrich> with a ui progressbar
[12:06:34] <jrich> and gussing at css properties to change
[12:06:39] <jrich> the obvious color background-color
[12:06:44] <jrich> but i cant find a list of supported ones
[12:06:49] <min|dvir|us> jrich: you can change whatever CSS you like.
[12:06:58] <jrich> ok, then is there a good default list some place?
[12:07:07] <JosephSilber> BTW, I find that using jqapi.com is much easier. Won't help you in this case (since the content is all the same), but the navigation is just SO much better. Just sayin'
[12:07:18] <RabSimpson> min|dvir|us: i changed keypress to keydown and it didn't work and now it's stopped doing what it was meant to in the first place (which it was doing previously)
[12:07:21] <jrich> JosephSilber:  thanks i'll look at that
[12:07:33] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: is it recognizing backspace?
[12:07:40] <RabSimpson> nope
[12:07:48] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: console.log(code)
[12:08:12] <jrich> JosephSilber: thanks that looks way better
[12:08:16] <RabSimpson> where should i put that? at the end of my script?
[12:08:34] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: right after you define `var code`.
[12:08:37] <RabSimpson> ok
[12:08:40] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: maybe you should look at a JS tutorial.
[12:08:56] <lessthanzero> Not sure if I should be here or #javascript but - I have an element that is used in tons of random places on my site (a play button) and whenever that's clicked I'd love to bubble a custom event starting on <a class="play"> and bubble up from that elements markup (so I can bind to the event on whatever parent element up the stack that makes sense) I'm not entirely sure how bubbling of events work. Any pointer
[12:08:56] <lessthanzero> is greatly appreciated.
[12:09:09] <min|dvir|us> $('#Registration').keydown(function (e) { console.log(e.keyCode); }); in my JS console shows me '8' whenever I press backspace.
[12:09:46] <RabSimpson> that's why i get
[12:10:01] <RabSimpson> *what
[12:10:26] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: that's what you wanted, no?
[12:10:37] <jrich> http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes
[12:10:42] <jrich> 8 is correct, you've captured it
[12:10:47] <RabSimpson> no, it isn't deleting the character next to the cursor
[12:11:43] <jrich> probably cuz you've captured and stopped it
[12:11:47] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: that's because you're preventDefaulting it.
[12:12:22] <RabSimpson> i can see that. it's preventDefaulting everything except 'a-zA-Z0-9 '
[12:12:36] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: so your question?
[12:12:52] <codephobic> sorry, neighbour came round, here's the jquert - http://jsfiddle.net/PCHcf/
[12:12:54] <RabSimpson> i'd like to allow backspace to perform as normal
[12:13:04] <codephobic> jquery*
[12:13:08] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: are you familiar with JS `if` statments?
[12:13:14] <RabSimpson> yup
[12:13:26] <min|dvir|us> Then fix your code.
[12:13:31] <RabSimpson> -_-
[12:13:38] <jrich> lol
[12:13:44] <jrich> RabSimpson:  its controled with in your IF
[12:13:56] <jrich> its a question of logic flow
[12:14:09] <RabSimpson> what i don't get is how to specify that it ignores the backspace
[12:14:14] <RabSimpson> the logic part i can deal with
[12:14:15] <jrich> read through it slowly, think about what each action means/will do
[12:14:26] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: do you know how to check if the key is a backspace?
[12:14:29] <jrich> you looked for 8, if 8, preventdefault
[12:14:46] <RabSimpson> i don't know how to check if a specific key has been pressed
[12:14:46] <min|dvir|us> jrich: if not 8.
[12:14:48] <jrich> or rather what you want is, if 8 continue (nothing)
[12:14:53] <RabSimpson> i now know that backspace is 8
[12:14:57] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: do you know how to compare values in JS?
[12:15:17] <RabSimpson> are you ripping the piss? yes i get the logic part, i just don't know how to check for 8
[12:15:36] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: don't be arrogant when you're learning.
[12:15:41] <RabSimpson> same to you
[12:15:51] <min|dvir|us> Oh man.
[12:15:53] <RabSimpson> the logic part i get
[12:15:55] <RabSimpson> established
[12:15:58] <vsync_> ummmm
[12:16:05] <RabSimpson> i don't know how to check if 8 has been pressed
[12:16:22] <vsync_> keydown... keycode... 8. Hot tips
[12:16:24] <min|dvir|us> I have pity for the person that hired you for this.
[12:16:42] <min|dvir|us> How'd you trick him into believing you're the right person for the job?
[12:16:46] <RabSimpson> right now i pity anyone who has to deal with your condescension
[12:17:09] <vsync_> RabSimpson: alright, you figured how to print out the key that's being pressed, yes?
[12:17:09] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: you are going to get condescension on IRC.
[12:17:17] <min|dvir|us> Especially when you don't know shit and think you do.
[12:17:22] <RabSimpson> vsync_: in the console, yeah
[12:17:33] <vsync_> yeah, so use that variable, compare with 8, presto?
[12:17:46] <RabSimpson> vsync_: thanks, i'll give it a go
[12:17:52] <vsync_> okay, sure
[12:18:03] <jrich> is there a sleep?
[12:18:12] <min|dvir|us> jrich: no.
[12:18:14] <min|dvir|us> There is a setTimeout.
[12:18:23] <min|dvir|us> jrich: JS is single-threaded, so a sleep would block all events.
[12:19:02] <jrich> oh, was just trying to fake a progress bar
[12:19:14] <min|dvir|us> jrich: recursive setTimeout.
[12:19:18] <min|dvir|us> Or setInterval. Your choice.
[12:19:23] <RabSimpson> vsync_: thanks, that's it sorted :)
[12:19:29] <jrich> k, i'll take a look thanks
[12:19:51] <RabSimpson> min|dvir|us: go check my code to see me using the magical `if` statements...
[12:20:10] <min|dvir|us> RabSimpson: why?
[12:20:50] <RabSimpson> as i understand it, sarcasm doesn't translate well in type, but since you're the most intelligent person in the universe i was sure you'd get it
[12:21:00] <RabSimpson> bye
[12:21:20] <min|dvir|us> What a loser.
[12:21:33] <jrich> i think the point was more to be polite rather than demand
[12:25:58] <jrich> im looking at the progressbar example on jqueryui, and they dont even show a progressbar object, just two divs lol
[12:26:35] <min|dvir|us> jrich: which example?
[12:26:44] <jrich> custom label
[12:26:50] <jrich> http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/#label
[12:27:07] <min|dvir|us> jrich: what's wrong with it?
[12:27:21] <jrich> well, nothing, but i dont get why the only html is two <div
[12:27:28] <jrich> shouldnt there be a <progressbar?
[12:30:41] <jrich> is it just because of the class on the div?
[12:31:19] <min|dvir|us> jrich: the progress bar is instantiated on line 28.
[12:31:41] <jrich> oh...hmm
[12:34:23] <jrich> you can attach a progressbar to anything.... weird
[12:36:28] <jrich> ok, time to walk the dog, thanks for the help min|dvir|us
[12:42:06] <codephobic> I figured out where I was going wrong.
[12:42:21] <codephobic> (aside from the over ambitious php object)
[12:42:56] <codephobic> forgot to change a variable name, which meant that my script was comparing against the wrong thing.
[12:43:45] <codephobic> anyhow, thanks for pointing out the error of my json object ... will fix that later, I think I should take a break ... given the kind of mistakes I'm making now.
[12:50:55] <Fraz> hi
[12:51:06] <rmill> hiya
[12:51:31] <Fraz> is it possible to store an event in a variable?
[12:52:08] <Fraz> myEvent = $("something").click; myEvent(SomeFunction);
[12:52:11] <Fraz> something like this
[12:52:58] <rmill> I guess? Kind of odd if you ask me.
[12:53:06] <rmill> Why not just store the selector?
[12:53:20] <rmill> var something = $( 'something' );
[12:53:31] <Fraz> well i have some user settings to set an event type such as click or hover
[12:53:32] <rmill> something.trigger('click');
[12:53:41] <Fraz> are-eventType = "click-banner"
[12:54:02] <Fraz> then i was gonna do a switch to store the appropriate event then call it
[12:56:00] <Fraz> instead of a bunch of ifs
[12:59:22] <mk> Server updates caused me to go down.
[12:59:26] <mk> zissou,
[12:59:30] <snover> twss
[12:59:48] <mk> I knew about serialise, etc this was more of an example.
[12:59:56] <mk> beforesend will help :)
[12:59:59] <mk> TY
[13:00:36] <Dave_Stein> what reason would $(window).height() not change value as I changed browser size? it's supposed to be the viewport..
[13:01:40] <Dave_Stein> i think i just realized cause i was missing a doctype in my demo script...bug or feature? heh
[13:07:11] <madabyss> Hey all. Trying to figure out what the difference is between $().click( function() { and $().live('click', function() {
[13:08:04] <mk> .live is deprecated, madabyss
[13:08:20] <mk> I prefer to use .on over  both.
[13:08:41] <madabyss> mk: Okay, I'll give that one a go.
[13:08:59] <madabyss> mk: I use $().on('click', etc...?
[13:09:55] <mk> madabyss, That works
[13:10:06] <Dave_Stein> madabyss: live is deprecated. on/off is preferred. click is a shortcut to on I believe
[13:10:54] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: thanks man. I'll have to familiarize myself with that method. I've been using .live for a while now.
[13:11:05] <mk> :)
[13:11:22] <Dave_Stein> madabyss: The API was very confusing with bind/unbind/live/delegate/die etc
[13:11:31] <Dave_Stein> on/off was the recent consolidation in 1.7 or 1.8?
[13:11:51] <madabyss> Confusing is an understatement.
[13:11:55] <mk> I  don't remember, but 1.7 sounds familiar :p
[13:13:22] <madabyss> Reason I ask is becuase I'm having trouble getting this to work: http://pastebin.com/fVAHv3pP
[13:13:36] <madabyss> I need to dynamically load data into a fancybox before showing it.
[13:13:53] <madabyss> All thought the data loads, the link has to be clicked twice before the lightbox pops up.
[13:14:00] <madabyss> Any thoughts?
[13:15:43] <Dave_Stein> ew fancybox :P uh let me look
[13:16:00] <mk> I'm out
[13:16:06] <Dave_Stein> see ya
[13:16:11] <mk> :)
[13:16:15] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: Yea, didn't have a choice. Making mods to an existing site.
[13:16:17] <Dave_Stein> madabyss:  e.returnValue = false;  is redundant for jQuery sine preventDefault is handled for IE for you already
[13:16:41] <Fraz> are-eventType = "click-banner"; <-- "invalid assignment left hand side"
[13:16:42] <Fraz> huh?
[13:16:50] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: That wasn't working for me in IE 7 back.
[13:16:54] <Dave_Stein> Fraz: Can't use a dash in variable name
[13:16:56] <madabyss> *IE 8 back
[13:17:00] <Fraz> oh derp
[13:17:03] <Fraz> thanks
[13:17:11] <Dave_Stein> madabyss: So wait you want to click on lightbox-send-to-friend twice?
[13:17:31] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: no just once.
[13:17:40] <madabyss> But it only appears if you click it twice for some reason.
[13:18:29] <Dave_Stein> well the if (e) line is ognna stop it
[13:18:42] <Dave_Stein> i think you mean to put that AFTER fancybox
[13:18:49] <Dave_Stein> otherwise you might be messing up sometinhg inside fancybox
[13:18:55] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: thought the same so I moved it to the end and still have the same problem.
[13:19:28] <Dave_Stein> you should also remove  $(function() { }); wrapping
[13:19:33] <Dave_Stein> that isnt doing anything for you there
[13:19:57] <Dave_Stein> if anything that might be hurting you cause thats like saying document.ready when youre already documet.ready at that point
[13:20:33] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: Yea, figured. I'm just trying anything at this point. I didn't have it there before...
[13:21:08] <Dave_Stein> i'd say console.log in the function to see if its hitting fancybox line or not and/or use a breakpoint in firebug and/or use "break on error" in firebug :)
[13:21:34] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: I have tried without it as well like in this example (which is cleaner): http://pastebin.com/eKUKXscY
[13:21:56] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: did both of those as well. Console hits and shows $(this). No errors are occuring.
[13:22:29] <Dave_Stein> actually when i loo kat that code
[13:22:33] <Dave_Stein> i dont see how fancybox gets its contents at all
[13:23:22] <Dave_Stein> youre opening fancybox but whats happening after that to populate it
[13:24:32] <madabyss> Before opening fancybox, I'm populating the hidden div with product visible product info. Then calling fancybox on the <a> object.
[13:25:28] <Fraz> jQuery("#adRotateExpandablePreview").bind('click', areBannerClickHandler); how can i use a delay with this?
[13:25:43] <Dave_Stein> why not just open fancybox by passing the HTML in at that point
[13:25:51] <Fraz> so the ad expands after a couple of seconds of being clicked
[13:26:18] <Dave_Stein> Fraz: if you ALWAYS want it to do that you can put inside your callback a setTimeout
[13:26:38] <Fraz> ok thanks
[13:27:23] <Dave_Stein> you can do $.fancybox( myhtml );
[13:27:38] <Dave_Stein> oh wait
[13:27:44] <Dave_Stein> thats how you threw me off madabyss
[13:28:07] <Dave_Stein> $('#element').fancybox() means i will initialize the fancybox after click of this element
[13:28:17] <Dave_Stein> therefore your first click on send to friend just lets fancybox know to work for click next time
[13:28:28] <Dave_Stein> madabyss ^^
[13:28:34] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: GOT IT... Okay, I'll try to pass it the HTML
[13:29:42] <mobile8> any idea how i can wwrap 3 divs inside 1 div ?
[13:29:46] <mobile8> .wrap? how ?
[13:29:57] <Dave_Stein> I think you are correct about .wrap
[13:30:13] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: Don't suppose it would be a suprise to tell you that worked. Thanks man.
[13:30:25] <Dave_Stein> np
[13:30:37] <Dave_Stein> listening to EDM and programming so i was a little slow to notice real issue ;)
[13:31:46] <madabyss> Dave_Stein: Understandable :)
[13:33:19] <mobile8> any idea how I Can add multiple divs in 1 div?
[13:37:12] <jan_n> mobile8: what are you trying to do, and are you sure you checked the docs?
[13:37:25] <Fraz> Dave_Stein is it possible to track a timeout?
[13:38:02] <Fraz> the setTimeout is used in the event handler, but say i mouse out of the banner, is it possible to cancel that timeout?
[13:38:05] <Dave_Stein> Fraz: No, you really want to avoid using them unless you NEED a delay and then if yo uwant something to happen after delay the callback function should just do it
[13:38:10] <Dave_Stein> oh
[13:38:11] <Dave_Stein> to cancel yes
[13:38:11] <mobile8> jan_n: found it nvm
[13:38:15] <Dave_Stein> clearTImeout
[13:38:19] <Dave_Stein> if you saved it off
[13:38:29] <Fraz> save it off?
[13:39:32] <rmill> mobile8: $('div').append('<div>'); ??
[13:40:28] <Fraz> think i got it figured out
[13:44:25] <mobile8> rmill: no
[13:44:32] <mobile8> is there a way to change the order in a div?
[13:44:39] <mobile8> to move an element to be the first?
[13:45:14] <Dave_Stein> $('#parent').prepend( $('#child') )
[13:45:28] <Dave_Stein> var x = setTImeout( .... )
[13:45:30] <Dave_Stein> clearTImeout( x );
[13:45:33] <Dave_Stein> minus the double typo
[13:45:37] <mobile8> Dave_Stein: so in case #child is the last element of #parent it moves to be the first?
[13:45:42] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[13:45:52] <mobile8> Dave_Stein: ok thanks
[13:46:42] <rmill> Take a look at append, appendTo and prepend.
[13:47:04] <rmill> DOM manipulation is hard.
[13:47:12] <rmill> (not really)
[13:47:23] <min|dvir|us> rmill: I was going to say.
[13:47:46] <rmill> ;)
[14:00:31] <Fraz> anyone know how to stop a youtube video with jquery?
[14:01:32] <min|dvir|us> Fraz: https://developers.google.com/youtube/js_api_reference#Playback_controls
[14:02:48] <Fraz> hmm
[14:02:54] <Fraz> how doe sthis work if you have multiple videos
[14:03:05] <Fraz> will it stop them all?
[14:03:23] <min|dvir|us> Fraz: TIAS.
[14:38:12] <relipse2> when a jquery ui dialog gets created is there a way to ensure it is in the center of the screen and fixed?
[14:42:38] <madabyss> Is there a way to fire off a function when .fadeIn() is complete?
[14:58:18] <madabyss> Anyone here familiar with deferreds?
[14:58:46] <relipse2> why isnt this working: dlg$.find('.ui-dialog-titlebar').css({ display:'none' });
[14:58:57] <relipse2> how do i find a child of dlg$
[15:03:42] <relipse2> how do you change global variables in jsfiddle?
[15:04:09] <Ungy> window.variable?
[15:10:05] <Dummies_freelanc> can helpme with sencha touch?
[15:11:16] <relipse2> CHECK OUT MY plugin (updated!): http://jsfiddle.net/5yhmb/187/
[15:11:20] <relipse2> no title bar and fixed
[15:13:44] <Dummies_freelanc> hell i need do application with  touch!
[15:14:04] <Dummies_freelanc>  i want use jqtouch  but i dont know much of this library

[15:36:59] <brianng> hi
[15:37:15] <brianng> im having trouble with dom manipulation and jquery not working after that
[15:37:22] <brianng> i hv read about .on etc
[15:37:33] <brianng> but im using socket.io to gain new info
[15:37:46] <brianng> and based on this info im changing the number of tabs
[15:37:56] <brianng> but these jquery powered tabs stop working
[15:38:57] <brianng> how can i make jquery recognise this new DOM manipulation again
[16:06:29] <brianng> anyone there at all?
[16:06:59] <brianng> http://jsfiddle.net/Pqz3p/
[16:07:01] <brianng> help pls
[16:07:06] <brianng> anyone?
[16:13:51] <shoky> brianng: didn't understand your problem.. it vaguely sounds like you need to use event delegation, but you've hardly given any info so who knows
[16:14:03] <brianng> shoky
[16:14:09] <brianng> i want stuff inside content to work
[16:14:19] <brianng> content is stuff i have added
[16:14:34] <shoky> "stuff"?  "to work" ?
[16:14:44] <brianng> yeah to work with jquery
[16:14:48] <brianng> like tabs etc
[16:14:51] <shoky> it works just fine  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Pqz3p/1/
[16:15:24] <brianng> shoky: yes for stuff that dont need jquery
[16:15:52] <brianng> shoky: i need the stuff inside content to work with jquery
[16:16:12] <shoky> make a jsfiddle showing your problem. otherwise no idea what you want.  "i need stuff to work" is useless. jquery or not
[16:16:21] <brianng> k
[16:16:24] <brianng> 2mins
[16:16:49] <shoky> have you read about event delegation?
[16:17:35] <shoky> in a nutshell:   $('#staticContainer').on('click', '.clickableItem', function() { ... })
[16:28:46] <dumbdell> hey there.. I lost my jsfiddle link for the clocks project i was playing with any chance some one still has it in there logs / history?
[16:28:57] <vsync_> how long ago
[16:29:06] <dumbdell> 48 hours or so
[16:30:16] <Dummies_freelanc> jqtouch is part of sencha ?
[16:30:44] <ATIXIUM> :D

[16:31:44] <vsync_> why not the round one instead
[16:32:03] <dumbdell> no worries vsync_ it was a long shot ;) dont you just hate it when that happens
[16:32:16] <ATIXIUM> eh round tables are not used anymore
[16:32:38] <dumbdell> not only was the jsfiddle version the cleaned up version but i think i just worked out how to make it work
[16:32:39] <vsync_> dumbdell: i usually have my codes in my hdd aswell ;D *poke*
[16:32:39] <ATIXIUM> anyhow, I have pickle (problem)
[16:32:50] <vsync_> oh
[16:33:45] <dumbdell> oh well .. doing it all again works out for the best some times
[16:34:11] <ATIXIUM> I have 2 frames running in my page but 1 loads and the other doesn't :( I already tried the $.noConflict(true); script but no luck, can anyone help?
[16:34:22] <ATIXIUM> frameworks*

[16:37:01] <ATIXIUM> :( I've been at it for the past week :(
[16:37:37] <ATIXIUM> can I paste the code for anyone to see? it's a small script
[16:38:43] <ATIXIUM> 		$(window).load(function() {
[16:38:44] <ATIXIUM> 			$.noConflict(true);						
[16:38:46] <ATIXIUM> 			jQuery('#world').fhparallax({
[16:38:47] <ATIXIUM> 				editor:'off',

[16:40:55] <coldhead> sweet paste bro
[16:42:35] <ATIXIUM> that's odd
[16:46:21] <madabyss> Does $(window).resize(function() { need to be in doc.ready?
[16:48:34] <yellowfish> if i've a div full of text, how do i change its color?
[16:48:52] <f00f> color of the div or color of the text?
[16:49:16] <f00f> you can sett css properties using .css()
[16:52:58] <Gazpacho> madabyss: no it doesn't need to, it will work as documented wherever it is
[16:53:13] <madabyss> Gazpacho: thanks bud.
[16:54:06] <yellowfish> how do i check whats the value of a button i selected?
[16:54:10] <yellowfish> multiple radio buttons
[16:54:45] <ATIXIUM> ?
[16:54:55] <ATIXIUM> disconnection again
[16:54:58] <ATIXIUM> dafuq
[16:55:29] <ATIXIUM> damn conflict with other libraries in jQuery yar
[16:58:23] <Gazpacho> yellowfish: http://api.jquery.com/val/
[17:02:15] <yellowfish> ok ive a div
[17:02:19] <yellowfish> inside of it are two radio buttons
[17:02:44] <yellowfish> neither of the buttons have an id
[17:02:48] <yellowfish> how do i know which one is selected?
[17:02:52] <yellowfish> they have different values though
[17:04:02] <thujone> give them an id
[17:04:39] <thujone> they should share the same field name if they're in the same group of options
[17:05:09] <yellowfish> thujone, i cannot modify that file to give them an id
[17:05:23] <yellowfish> both buttons have the same name yes
[17:05:27] <yellowfish> but different values
[17:05:32] <yellowfish> name="color"
[17:05:40] <yellowfish> value="red" and value="blue"
[17:05:52] <yellowfish> how do i trigger an event when red is selected ?
[17:07:08] <vsync_> hmm
[17:07:21] <vsync_> if($('#button').val() == 'red') ?
[17:07:49] <yellowfish> VSpike, there's no id called button
[17:07:59] <yellowfish> 		Red <input type="radio" name="color" value="Red" /><br />
[17:08:00] <vsync_> well, use something to identify it?
[17:08:07] <yellowfish> i can't modify that file to add an ID
[17:08:11] <yellowfish> im not suppose to edit it
[17:08:12] <vsync_> okay well then
[17:08:20] <yellowfish> im suppose to select it based on the name and the value
[17:08:29] <thujone> $(':radio[name="color"]').click( function() { if ($(this).val() == 'red') { doThis(); } })
[17:08:29] <Gazpacho> yellowfish, the page has an example for a radio button
[17:09:01] <vsync_> thujone beat me to it
[17:09:04] <Gazpacho> even if the button doesn't have an id it surely has a name
[17:09:17] <vsync_> #button was just a placeholder
[17:09:26] <thujone> bah
[17:10:53] <shoky> dumbdell: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[17:14:03] <jordotech> Hi, I've spent the last couple days pulling my hair out over something.  I cannot alter the dom in any way after any ajax navigation between pages
[17:14:40] <jordotech> i.e. in the console
[17:17:21] <guideX> when I have a jquery select menu inside of a fancybox popup, and I show the popup a second or third time after that page's load, sometimes the jquery select menu's are hidden, any ideas?
[17:17:24] <shoky> jordotech: you'll need to give more info than that ..
[17:19:15] <jordotech> shoky: simply put, I ajax navigate to a 2nd page and .load() will not affect the dom
[17:20:26] <jordotech> working as expected?
[17:21:26] <shoky> jordotech: that's still hardly any more info. don't put it simply
[17:21:46] <shoky> a demo would be best
[17:23:01] <jordotech> will do
[17:23:52] <shoky> ?jsfiddle
[17:23:52] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[17:25:42] <jordotech> shoky, is jquery 1.7.2 only compatible with jqm 1.1.1?  thats the only option in jsfiddle when choosing that jquery version
[17:26:49] <shoky> jordotech: uhh you could've mentioned that you're talking about jqm, for example
[17:27:32] <shoky> you can include whatever you want in jsfiddle as external resources
[17:28:00] <jordotech> oh geez, i'm fried, i meant to go to #jquerymobile
[17:28:24] <shoky> #jquery is also the support channel for jqm
[17:28:43] <shoky> hopefully someone can help you
[17:28:48] <shoky> (if you make the demo)
[17:30:24] <jordotech> making it now
[17:30:29] <shoky> doesn't jqm handle the ajax/navigation for you? why are you .load()ing anyway
[17:31:40] <d3c0> hi
[17:32:29] <jordotech> i'm trying to inject some content into an ajax loaded page but nothing will affect the dom after changing pages
[17:33:10] <shoky> $('body').empty()  will probably affect the dom
[17:33:45] <d3c0> please I need dropdown selection with ajax
[17:33:55] <shoky> are you waiting for the right init event for the page load? pageinit or whatever event is needed there (i donno jqm too much)
[17:34:03] <d3c0> do you have some examples
[17:35:06] <d3c0> drop down with ajax
[17:35:07] <jordotech> shoky, yea, I've tried pageinit, pagebeforeload.  also, yes, empty() is working
[17:35:28] <shoky> so the dom is affected fine ;P
[17:36:40] <guideX> when I have a jquery select menu inside of a fancybox popup, and I show the popup a second or third time after that page's load, sometimes the jquery select menu's are hidden, any ideas?
[17:37:03] <shoky> `demo @ guideX
[17:37:03] <b-ot> guideX: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:38:00] <guideX> hmm ok
[17:38:26] <shoky> much obliged
[17:42:35] <jordotech> shoky, can i pm you to show you
[17:45:44] <shoky> yea
[17:45:55] <shoky> jordotech^
[17:50:21] <d3c0> I need to do 3 dynamic dropdowns someone have a example to se the code, thanks you
[17:55:21] <yellowfish> how do i select a textbox with name "font"?
[17:55:33] <yellowfish> 	$(':text[name="font"]').keyup(function() ?
[17:57:22] <ericelliott> yellowfish: what's a textbox?
[17:57:30] <yellowfish> input style=text
[17:57:35] <yellowfish> input box
[17:57:39] <ericelliott> yellowfish: you mean input type="text"
[17:57:43] <yellowfish> yes
[17:57:46] <yellowfish> how do i select it
[17:58:00] <ericelliott> yellowfish: do you have any other inputs named "font"?
[17:58:05] <yellowfish> nope
[17:59:43] <ericelliott> yellowfish: well, that's good. Why not $('[name="font]')
[17:59:57] <ericelliott> well, without the type,
[17:59:59] <ericelliott> typo,
[18:00:06] <ericelliott> don't trust anything I type at this point.
[18:00:12] <ericelliott> Hopefully you get the idea. ;)
[18:01:22] <ericelliott> Since names are supposed to be unique, that should work. =)
[18:02:00] <tomo> Does jquery mobile have a feature/component for horizontal scroll?
[18:02:27] <tomo> My custom css does not work only on android web browser somwhow.
[18:04:08] <tomo> Anybody?
[18:04:35] <simpleirc> hi tomo whats up?
[18:05:08] <tomo> simpleirc: thanks for your reply. let me paste my question again.
[18:05:09] <yellowfish> ericelliott, ya it didn't work
[18:05:21] <yellowfish> there is another ID with the id font
[18:05:24] <yellowfish> but that's houldn't be the problem
[18:05:31] <tomo> Does jquery mobile have a feature/component for horizontal scroll? My custom css does not work only on android web browser somwhow.
[18:05:39] <tomo> somwhow*
[18:05:43] <tomo> somehow*
[18:05:44] <shoky> yellowfish: well that's how you do it
[18:05:50] <yellowfish> http://jsfiddle.net/FW3L2/1/
[18:05:52] <yellowfish> this is the code
[18:05:55] <MickRip> ericelliott: is that you?
[18:06:18] <yellowfish> im trying to make it so that when you change the number in the font textbox
[18:06:21] <yellowfish> it changes the font of the text
[18:06:27] <yellowfish> font size
[18:06:32] <shoky> yellowfish: you have:   $('[name="font]').keyup(function() {
[18:06:34] <simpleirc> tomo: which browser?
[18:06:48] <shoky> yellowfish: and you're getting an error in your console, i hope you're looking there
[18:07:18] <tomo> simpleirc: all major browsers, but main targets are iphone and android. My custome css does not work only on android somehow.
[18:07:52] <MickRip> tomo: welcome to android :P
[18:08:02] <yellowfish> shoky, ?
[18:08:02] <tomo> MickRip: :)
[18:08:04] <yellowfish> what error
[18:08:34] <simpleirc> tomo: best place to ask is #css
[18:08:51] <yellowfish> ok fixed http://jsfiddle.net/FW3L2/2/
[18:09:03] <tomo> simpleirc: I've already done  that.
[18:09:04] <yellowfish> how do i make the font size change when you enter then umber into the box?
[18:09:16] <tomo> simpleirc: and nobody answered.
[18:09:36] <shoky> yellowfish: do you know what the console is?
[18:09:47] <shoky> yellowfish: press F12 and look for the console
[18:09:52] <simpleirc> tomo: show us the css code pls
[18:10:27] <tomo> simpleirc: okay, wait a min plz.
[18:11:02] <simpleirc> tomo: you have 3 secs to comply.
[18:11:25] <tomo> lol
[18:12:38] <tomo> simpleirc: but the result might be different with JQM or without it, right?
[18:13:29] <simpleirc> jqm?
[18:13:41] <simpleirc> oh
[18:14:00] <tomo> simpleirc: yes
[18:14:10] <simpleirc> what you trying to scroll?
[18:14:17] <tomo> running on jsfiddle with the minimu code(I think) without JQM, it gives me different result
[18:14:30] <tomo> simpleirc: trying to implement horizontal scroll menu bar.
[18:15:10] <simpleirc> tomo: you dont need jqm for that
[18:15:21] <tomo> simpleirc: My app already use JQM..
[18:15:49] <MickRip> you'd think jqm (as hard as they work to get it working on all platforms) would solve most problems like this
[18:16:09] <simpleirc> tomo: then your screwed
[18:18:00] <Hmmz> Hello World!
[18:18:15] <Hmmz> Does anyone use BaseX?
[18:18:38] <shoky> i prefer crack

[18:19:46] <simpleirc> puss y for me
[18:20:27] <simpleirc> as in the animal cat
[18:20:37] <simpleirc> :-)
[18:21:34] <simpleirc> tomo: update your android device :-)
[18:24:35] <yellowfish> is there a way to select by value?
[18:25:40] <simpleirc> yes
[18:41:29] <bananasdoom> Hello all
[18:42:23] <Tamborine> Good morning, hope everyone is well.... I have a video I am adding to shadowbox from an iframe. with the shadowbox onClose handler I am trying to remove the video element with $(#iframe-id).remove() so that the element is removed from the DOM - In IE only the sound for the video keeps playing even though the iframe is being removed from the dom... does anyone have an other ideas about how i
[18:42:23] <Tamborine> would fix this?
[18:44:24] <MickRip> ericelliott: eric is that you?
[18:48:11] <bananasdoom> I wan to use .load() but I dont think I am dooing this right at all http://pastebin.com/dg9WRk3y
[19:01:47] <dnsdds> Is there any way to 'listen' to changes in an object's attributes?
[19:04:50] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/rDLUk/71/  ok any one know why the clock is running like a time machine now lols
[19:13:28] <dnsdds> Sorry, I meant changes to a DOM element's attributes
[19:16:40] <dumbdell> dnsdds .attr
[19:17:55] <dnsdds> dumbdell: But that doesn't listen to them, does it? Like if I change the attribute with .attr(), then listener would notice and run a callback
[19:18:39] <dnsdds> An interval would be one solution, but it does cause lag, one way or the other
[19:28:53] <smasshh> I can break a step in 'for' using `if ( condition ) { return; }` ?
[19:32:14] <monk3y> 'Return' is overkill, it will return out of a function if you're in one.  'break' will break out of a 'for' completely.  'continue' will do the next iteration.
[19:32:27] <SDr> howdy, while trying to implement flowplayer autoplay functionality, I ran into a situation where neither the autoPlay flag in the configuration file, nor in the constructor has any effect on flowplayer
[19:32:33] <SDr> see minimum-reproducable script: http://pastebin.com/YhZbpwvY
[19:32:37] <SDr> so I've tried binding a .play() function call to the ready event; however, this resulted in an infinite loop -for some reason, the play() event fired ready()
[19:32:41] <SDr> any suggestions on how to automatically start the video playback using flowplayer?
[19:34:35] <SDr> flowplayer 5.4.1
[19:35:06] <SDr> also, jquery.tmpl for generating the video
[19:35:13] <SDr> (without that, everything works OK)
[19:35:59] <s2013> im trying to make a simple script where i hover over a box and it disappears and another box appears there. i got it to work except the second box jumps instead ofa ppearing in that spot.
[19:36:40] <s2013> whats the best way to do that?
[19:36:44] <s2013> http://jsfiddle.net/4fCzk/2/ is what i have now
[19:40:13] <dumbdell> WOOOOOT
[19:40:14] <dumbdell> http://jsfiddle.net/rDLUk/92/
[19:40:36] <dumbdell> Worksky at long times and accurate down to the millisecond
[19:40:39] <dumbdell> :D
[19:41:37] <s2013> anyone?
[19:43:09] <dnsdds> dumbdell: Now just make the city label into an editable text box to change the time zone :D
[19:43:12] <dumbdell> i think you need absolute posistioning for that basically
[19:44:02] <dumbdell> for your fading box s2013
[19:44:51] <s2013> i was thinking an easier way would be to replace that div with another div
[19:49:18] <dumbdell> dnsdds it supports timezones .. you can do: clocktodeg("#whatclock","lable",local_utc_offset);
[19:51:36] <dnsdds> dumbdell: Yeah, but from a UX standpoint it would be awesome if you could just write any major city into the clock and then it sets to that :P
[19:52:56] <dnsdds> dumbdell: Timezones have names based on the cities they correspond to, after all, so I guess you could just get an array of those and search through it for a match
[19:57:50] <s2013> k i have another problem.. so i got the position to fix but when you hover over the box disappears and comes back http://jsfiddle.net/4fCzk/3/
[19:57:54] <s2013> how do i fix it?
[19:58:17] <dumbdell> ok i see what your saying
[19:58:47] <dumbdell> does actually make sense that you can define your own label for the clock
[20:01:00] <dnsdds> :)
[20:02:08] <dumbdell> hm.. well thought i had it cracked but nope..  ive noticed a little quirk with .css() .. if i tell it '-webkit-animation': 'anim-name 3600s linear infinite' .. then it behaves as if its running on milliseconds but if i tell it 36000ms it behaves like its only been told 3600ms and runs fast
[20:02:44] <dumbdell> but if i tell it 36000s it seems to work ok for seconds but not minutes
[20:04:12] <dumbdell> and weirder still it understands that 60's is 60s
[20:04:20] <relipse2> how do i open jquery ui dialog in the absolute center vertically and horizontally?
[20:07:56] <Qjimbo> Hey all, I'm trying to make it so when a user clicks an anchor link e.g. page.php#software, an event is triggered. I figured that I could add a click event to all links with a # in the target but I don't know how to select that in jquery - any suggestions?

[20:47:35] <wilkinsmc> my site works locally but not at all when hosted
[20:47:43] <wilkinsmc> i guess it has something to do with having to load the images
[20:47:51] <wilkinsmc> and i guess the stuff i programmed can't happen if they're not loaded :(
[20:47:59] <wilkinsmc> even works on wampserver
[20:48:30] <wilkinsmc> pretty frightening
[20:48:32] <wilkinsmc> i mean, wtf
[20:48:38] <wilkinsmc> how was i supposed to prevent against this?
[20:49:03] <jedimind> by not writing code that's dependent on the timing of your image load ?
[20:53:18] <wilkinsmc> i'm going to try doing img preload i guess
[21:05:10] <guideX> jquery ui select menu is buggy inside a popup... after first load, it never works until you reload the parent page
[21:05:47] <timaaarrreee> I'm having trouble figuring out how to keep track of nested callbacks. Is there a way to keep track of the sequence of callbacks when the order is an issue.
[21:06:37] <monk3y> timaaarrreee: make a breadcrumb trail of calls, that adds and removes nodes dynamically as you go, that you can console.log at any time?
[21:07:22] <timaaarrreee> monk3y: I pasted an abstract example of the issue http://pastie.org/7932474
[21:08:07] <timaaarrreee> monk3y: I've thought about using a queue to track calls but I didn't have much luck
[21:17:46] <HAPPYFUNBALL> how would I select a UL by its id
[21:18:14] <JosephSilber> HAPPYFUNBALL: just by its id: $('#the-id')
[21:19:27] <HAPPYFUNBALL> this is very strange
[21:19:44] <JosephSilber> HAPPYFUNBALL: What's strange, and how is it strange?
[21:20:36] <HAPPYFUNBALL> I am trying to make a menu pop into view using this code: http://pastebin.com/yv7BamM6
[21:20:39] <monk3y> timaaarrreee: sorry, I'm in the middle of my own code-chaos at the moment, will have a look when I can.
[21:21:01] <HAPPYFUNBALL> thing is, the console.log() statement isn't working
[21:21:40] <HAPPYFUNBALL> it looks like it can't find the button
[21:21:45] <HAPPYFUNBALL> which is extremely weird
[21:21:47] <timaaarrreee> monk3y: oh thanks. I don't think the example represents the issue that well but it might help. I do have the real problem case on github filed with a lot of mess
[21:25:55] <dumbdell> well i think i can confirm some sort of bug / glitch with jquerys .css() function and -webkit-animation-duration .. its like it some how interferes with the time resolution specified.. i've tested against 1.9.1 and 2.x edge .. i know that its not a css3 issue because if i use a style sheet the timing settings work as you would expect
[21:27:04] <HAPPYFUNBALL> so in order to find a div within a document, I'd use $(document).find('somediv'); right?
[21:28:02] <dumbdell> why not just $("#div").html("poop"); ?
[21:28:42] <HAPPYFUNBALL> whoa
[21:28:46] <HAPPYFUNBALL> what the hell is going on here
[21:28:57] <HAPPYFUNBALL> I can't find any dom elements with my code
[21:30:55] <HAPPYFUNBALL> what would cause something like that?

[21:32:41] <HAPPYFUNBALL> this code isn't finding anything
[21:33:26] <jedimind> that is some excessive code
[21:33:44] <HAPPYFUNBALL> ok
[21:33:57] <jedimind> #admin-options-button doesn't exist anywhere on the page
[21:34:03] <HAPPYFUNBALL> sure
[21:34:03] <jedimind> thats why its not finding it?
[21:34:10] <HAPPYFUNBALL> no, it exists for me
[21:34:14] <HAPPYFUNBALL> I am logged in
[21:34:17] <jedimind> is it there when the page loads/
[21:34:26] <jedimind> or does it get injected later
[21:34:27] <HAPPYFUNBALL> look for #header_link
[21:34:49] <HAPPYFUNBALL> fyi: it's the logo dov
[21:34:51] <HAPPYFUNBALL> *div
[21:35:04] <MickRip> HAPPYFUNBALL: just a 'thing' that I like to do, any jquery objects, use the $ .. ie. $adminButton instead of adminButton
[21:35:14] <HAPPYFUNBALL> ok
[21:35:20] <HAPPYFUNBALL> console.log($(document).find('#header_link')); doesn't work
[21:35:24] <HAPPYFUNBALL> it should though
[21:35:28] <jedimind> it should what
[21:35:38] <HAPPYFUNBALL> it should find the div
[21:35:39] <jedimind> what are you expecting .find to log ?
[21:35:56] <HAPPYFUNBALL> it should log the div in question to the console
[21:36:00] <MickRip> HAPPYFUNBALL: how come you don't just use var foo = $("#bar");
[21:36:02] <HAPPYFUNBALL> however, it's not
[21:36:22] <HAPPYFUNBALL> MickRip I wasn't aware I could
[21:36:28] <MickRip> HAPPYFUNBALL: :)
[21:36:38] <guideX> $("#header_link").dowhatever
[21:37:23] <HAPPYFUNBALL> ok
[21:37:35] <HAPPYFUNBALL> well check this out:

[21:37:36] <HAPPYFUNBALL> console.log(headerLink.length);
[21:37:44] <HAPPYFUNBALL> returns 0
[21:37:49] <MickRip> HAPPYFUNBALL: why don't you use jsfiddle? Might be easier
[21:37:52] <HAPPYFUNBALL> which isn't correct
[21:37:54] <HAPPYFUNBALL> http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[21:38:03] <guideX> console.log($("#header_link").length);
[21:38:04] <Ukto> hey guys, why does my json data get dropped and not stored in the global var? http://pastebin.com/Y4mdXxSc
[21:38:09] <jedimind> if you isolate your issue and put it up on jsfiddle we can help you
[21:38:50] <HAPPYFUNBALL> guideX that is returning 0 as well
[21:39:27] <HAPPYFUNBALL> I wonder if perhaps I'm calling the script too eary?
[21:39:29] <HAPPYFUNBALL> *early
[21:39:46] <guideX> what are you trying to do with the length
[21:39:56] <guideX> are you trying to figure out if there's a link or not?
[21:40:02] <HAPPYFUNBALL> guideX this is just for a test.
[21:40:15] <guideX> ah ok.. because an a href most likely has no length
[21:40:20] <guideX> a div too
[21:40:26] <guideX> a div will have a width
[21:40:32] <HAPPYFUNBALL> it seems odd that it's returning 0 when it exists in the dom
[21:40:41] <jijojohn> hello
[21:40:49] <guideX> which you will get with $("#header_link").attr("width");
[21:40:55] <jedimind> guideX, what are you talking about ?

[21:41:15] <HAPPYFUNBALL> guideX I'm just trying to find out if an object exists. I don't care about it's html length
[21:41:41] <guideX> hmm ok ... why not do like $("#header_link").html().length;
[21:41:57] <jedimind> guideX, shhhh
[21:42:02] <jedimind> you're not helping

[21:43:34] <abes> Question: I am using a jquery .change funciton on a radio button - it works when I check given radio button, but then when I check another one, it seems as if the change event doesn't register - any thoughts?
[21:43:44] <napster> jedimind: Does Jqmobile follow same origin policy?
[21:43:56] <napster> I think it does not
[21:45:43] <guideX> if I click on an element, and then wish to prevent other click events from being fired off, how?
[21:46:03] <guideX> so say I have a click1 function and click2, and click2 fires, how do I prevent click1 from firing?
[21:46:16] <guideX> in firefox and ie
[21:46:17] <jedimind> napster, its nothing to do with jqmobile
[21:46:59] <napster> ok, did you check that code? It should be working generally right?
[21:47:31] <napster> jedimind: ^^
[21:47:33] <MickRip> Ukto: did you figure out your problem?
[21:47:37] <jijojohn> i cant understand what is that jquery boiler
[21:48:01] <jedimind> napster, yeah it should be working based on your syntax etc
[21:48:04] <jedimind> there are no obvious errors
[21:48:06] <jijojohn> any way to get a book on jquery ajax json on php ?
[21:48:16] <abes> guideX: prevent default or return false?
[21:48:26] <jedimind> jijojohn, did you just put every acronym into one sentence?
[21:48:33] <guideX> I have all three in there
[21:48:44] <MickRip> jijojohn: there's so many internet tutorials
[21:48:47] <guideX> it's still reaching the other click event

[21:49:16] <abes> guideX: you have a jsfiddle of it?
[21:49:19] <jedimind> jijojohn, did you try google ?
[21:49:23] <napster> jedimind: hmm, alright. What method do you guys use for debugging such apps? I'm new to Jqmob.
[21:49:30] <guideX> well no, it's a nested bunch of ul's and li's...
[21:49:39] <guideX> it would be difficult to reproduce outside of the page
[21:49:41] <jedimind> napster, just web inspector chrome or firebug
[21:49:46] <jedimind> keep your eye on the Net tab
[21:49:50] <jedimind> and see the request / response
[21:49:52] <jedimind> that happens
[21:49:55] <abes> guideX: link?
[21:50:02] <jedimind> you can see exactly what the response is, or if the request gets sent or what
[21:50:06] <guideX> local test site too
[21:50:06] <napster> jedimind: hum! I was infact testing on the device itself.
[21:50:14] <napster> It is an android phone
[21:50:33] <guideX> it's a bunch of nested ul's and li's with jquery click events, and the click events fall through
[21:51:06] <jedimind> napster, there is remote debugging on android devices that's available
[21:51:08] <jedimind> with chrome
[21:51:16] <napster> I see!
[21:51:22] <jedimind> https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging
[21:51:43] <jijojohn> jedimind tried google,but there is no beginner to advanced tutorials in ajax jquery json php
[21:51:48] <napster> cool thanks jedimind
[21:52:08] <jedimind> jijojohn, you didn't try hard enough, stop wasting people's time here please
[21:52:10] <MickRip> jijojohn: what are you trying to acheive?
[21:52:18] <jedimind> he's trying to achieve ajax query json php
[21:52:20] <jedimind> obviously
[21:52:29] <jedimind> jquery*
[21:53:42] <Ukto> MickRip: no, I did not figure out why I cant store my json data in a global var :/ http://pastebin.com/Y4mdXxSc
[21:54:24] <MickRip> Ukto: you need to learn how async works :)  ..
[21:54:42] <Ukto> you can ignore the url, for you guys it wont give json data.  but if i just set jsonData = 'ttt';  console.log still has nothing for the global var
[21:54:58] <Ukto> ugh i completely forgot about it being async
[21:55:05] <MickRip> Ukto: example. Inside your json callback .. have console.log("Callback "+json); ...
[21:55:27] <MickRip> Ukto: and then at the end.. have console.log("Outside "+json) ;;.... and you'll see how things flow
[21:55:32] <Ukto> i will just use .done :P
[21:55:33] <madabyss> Any History.js pros in here? Need help with "back" state change.
[21:57:21] <jijojohn> Mickrip now my team is planning to develop a social network like facebook,so we want to use ajax in the site.so we found normal ajax had some compatibility issues in some browser,so i suggested jquery ajax.but cant find any good tutorials  on php ajax jquery json ,,,,@jedimind sorry if i done any bad thing
[21:57:35] <MickRip> jijojohn: !!! .. you lead a team?!
[21:57:44] <jijojohn> yah
[21:59:00] <MickRip> jijojohn: perhaps you need to do some 'hello world' stuff before you try to take on Facebook :P
[22:00:00] <jedimind> lol
[22:00:21] <jedimind> good luck with that
[22:00:50] <jijojohn> i am an expert in php ,know little javascript , tried jquery little bit .. dont jquery ajax..help me guys
[22:01:20] <MickRip> jijojohn: the jquery ajax docs are REALLY clear, and there's like 1,000,000 examples on the internetz
[22:01:25] <jedimind> dude there's no fucking thing we can tell you that will help you build "Facebook" with no knowledge whatsover
[22:02:33] <MickRip> jijojohn: <?php  echo json_encode(array("hello world", "all hail Sachin")); ?> ... jquery will read that quite easily and you can do all sorts of stuff
[22:02:56] <jedimind> MickRip, sachin monga?
[22:05:37] <MickRip> I guess you only think you know as much as you know
[22:12:54] <guideX> http://jsfiddle.net/peBTA  how do I prevent click1 from firing when click2 fires, and vice versa
[22:13:25] <MickRip> huglester: event.stopPropagation()?
[22:13:30] <Ukto> MickRip: hmm, no matter what i try.. even using .done() it wants to execute my function passing the data var before its done loading it :/
[22:13:52] <MickRip> Ukto: chuck it in jsfiddle so one of us can, erm, fiddle
[22:22:46] <guideX> so no ideas?
[22:22:52] <guideX> i'm a bit desperate :>
[22:25:07] <MickRip> guideX: event.stopPropagation()?
[22:25:30] <MickRip> guideX: that'll stop any events in the que
[22:25:46] <guideX> ah ok
[22:25:59] <guideX> but that's in there..
[22:26:05] <guideX> it's not doing it
[22:26:11] <MickRip> is it? I didn't look, just a sec
[22:27:39] <MickRip> guideX: stick it at the beginning of the function
[22:27:46] <guideX> hmm ok
[22:28:17] <guideX> oh wait, it's because event isn't right...
[22:28:32] <guideX> it should be in the function(e), then changed event to e
[22:29:02] <guideX> http://jsfiddle.net/peBTA/1
[22:29:05] <guideX> thanks for your help
[22:29:38] <MickRip> guideX: der, that was my bad, well spotted
[22:49:14] <wilkinsmc> figured out what the problem was with jquery only working locally
[22:49:18] <wilkinsmc> some capitalization was off
[22:49:24] <wilkinsmc> which is a problem on linux/unix or w/e
[22:49:30] <wilkinsmc> so glad my code wasn't fooked
[22:50:42] <wilkinsmc> the only thing is that there are ads on my site
[22:50:45] <wilkinsmc> wtf
[22:50:48] <wilkinsmc> makes it look shitty
[23:52:04] <Ukto> hmm, is there some kind of limitation on getJSON ?  I verified if I access the url directly, i can recv the complete data.. on small lists getJSON works fine.. when it gets over a certin amount of data.. it just never executes its funciton.
[23:52:36] <Cork> Ukto: not really
[23:53:10] <sahilsk> i don't know why but am not able to access  $(this).parent() inside delegate method. Any help would be great.
[23:53:18] <Haprog> Ukto: You should check the server side script for possible problems with large amount of data, long execution time etc.
[23:53:31] <Cork> ?p
[23:53:39] <sahilsk> does delegate doesn't allow accessing dom around future elements?
[23:53:48] <Cork> sahilsk: paste your code in jsfiddle.net
[23:54:27] <bananasdoom> I am dooing a .load() and when I do my .cycle() stops working
[23:54:47] <bananasdoom> http://www.bananasdoom.byethost6.com/
[23:54:50] <bananasdoom> any ideas
[23:55:05] <sahilsk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/93Dgt/
[23:55:28] <Cork> bananasdoom: you're most likely replacing the element that the .cycle is running on
[23:55:32] <bananasdoom> http://pastebin.com/RP2GmqKh
[23:55:33] <sahilsk> http://jsfiddle.net/sahilsk/93Dgt/  , line number:   90.  delegate method not letting me accessing dom
[23:55:56] <sahilsk> Cork:  line number 90
[23:56:06] <diverdude> how do i change the cursor "on drag" ? http://jsfiddle.net/zH3kP/
[23:56:08] <bananasdoom> Cork: yes with the same one
[23:56:29] <Cork> sahilsk: this is in relation to the this.each loop, not the delegate
[23:56:54] <Cork> bananasdoom: so you need to start the cycle again, as the element is uses is gone
[23:57:09] <sahilsk> Cork: i didn't get. can you elaborate
[23:57:52] <Cork> this.each(function() { $(this).parent().delegate... })
[23:57:59] <Cork> this.each(function() { <-- $(this).parent() })
[23:58:04] <diverdude> anyone?
[23:59:03] <bananasdoom> Cork: I have tried to put the cycle function in after the load() but it does not work
[23:59:23] <ericelliott> sahilsk: .delegate() does let you attach event listeners to future elements, but .delegate() is deprecated. You should be using .on() in recent versions of jQuery.
[23:59:40] <Cork> bananasdoom: then you might have to check if the cycle has a way to update it's content
[23:59:53] <Cork> bananasdoom: or it might just not support it
