[08:13:17] <Northwoods> Is there a way to directly get name attribute of element by class
[08:13:34] <Northwoods> $(".btn-causas").attr('name');
[08:33:47] <Northwoods> Basically i need to loop through select box options and if name attr is equal to text of select , then make i selected.
[08:50:11] <Northwoods> hi robertmaxrees
[08:51:27] <Northwoods> $('.xls_col').append($('<option />', {value: value.colnum, text: value.colval}));
[08:52:23] <Northwoods> if ($(this).text() == $(this).attr('name')).prop("selected",true)
[08:57:28] <Northwoods> $('.xls_col').append($('<option />', {value: value.colnum, text: value.colval})).find('option[text="'+ value.colval +'"]').prop('selected', true);
[09:18:00] <snake-venom> i am trying to resolve the google recaptcha,
[09:18:29] <snake-venom> QUE RELATED TO  google recaptcha , i hope this is not against the channel rules

[11:45:04] <grid-> hey
[13:49:14] <robertparkerx> I'm trying to hide two elements on mouse out or leave. I tried .mouseout() but it seems to hide nit when it is hovered too.
[13:49:56] <robertmaxrees> can you show us?
[13:54:58] <robertparkerx> It's on a dev server with htpasswd
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> i mean a fiddle :)
[13:55:25] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the code i have no idea what you are/are not doing.
[13:55:32] <robertparkerx> Right
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> so a test case on jsfiddle would be killer :D
[13:56:26] <robertparkerx> I think it's because I am going into another element
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> OK
[14:04:55] <robertparkerx> https://jsfiddle.net/2m6Lvbnd/ robertmaxrees
[14:05:13] <robertparkerx> this is a example that shows what I mean. if I hover over test it will hide it.
[14:08:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah... what are you expecting to have happen?
[14:08:49] <robertmaxrees> ah, you mean when you go from the parent to the child?
[14:09:45] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx
[14:10:13] <robertparkerx> yes
[14:10:19] <robertmaxrees> in that case, use mouseleave instead.
[14:10:27] <robertmaxrees> or check $(this).closest('.parent').length
[14:10:51] <robertparkerx> trying mouseleave
[14:11:20] <robertparkerx> you my friend are a genius
