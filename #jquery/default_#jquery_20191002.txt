[10:39:55] <ThatWebGuy> I have this code https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/wna81674/ .  I'm trying to figure out how I can change the text and svg icon when it's expanded/collapsed as well as hide the items that I just made visible.
[10:44:25] <Cork> ThatWebGuy: my recommendation would be to use css for the job
[10:44:35] <ThatWebGuy> Okay.  Thanks.
[10:44:55] <Cork> so set a class on ul for "compact view"
[10:45:06] <Cork> where ex nth-child() hides
[10:45:14] <Cork> and when the class is removed all is visible
[10:45:22] <Cork> you can do similar things for the show link
[10:45:53] <Cork> it makes the js logic easier to maintain
[10:47:03] <Cork> (also if all you want is a v arrow, you can do that with css ;) )
[10:48:13] <taplar> i think i'm a little behind on the logs.  did you suggest a delegate Cork?
[10:52:16] <Cork> taplar: not really, i suggested a complete rewrite to move the loggic out of js
[10:54:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/n65co4w8/   mmm, i was thinking they could do a delegate, and then transform that svg possibly
[11:02:05] <Cork> ThatWebGuy, taplar: this is what i was thinking of: https://jsfiddle.net/ft05dezn/1/
[11:02:52] <taplar> a lot cleaner, and clicking the svg actually works, heh
[11:03:02] <Cork> isn't svg :)
[11:03:03] <ThatWebGuy> Well that just blew my solution out of the water.
[11:03:06] <Cork> thats pure css
[11:03:14] <ThatWebGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/wna81674/1/
[11:03:46] <Cork> and changing how many values is visible is just changing a number in the css
[11:04:04] <Cork> :nth-child(n+6) => :nth-child(n+8) foe example
[11:04:15] <Cork> *for*
[11:04:43] <taplar> there's not a way that css could grab that from say a data element, right?
[11:05:26] <Cork> it's in the selector, css doesn't have variables for that yet, and i don't know of another way to do that without something like scss
[11:06:07] <Cork> you could have something like .list-5 li.list-item:nth-child(n+6) though
[11:06:22] <Cork> and .list-7 li.list-item:nth-child(n+8)
[11:06:24] <Cork> and so on
[11:06:33] <Cork> it is one liner in css so...
[11:07:03] <Cork> (the html would go from <ul class="list compact"> to <ul class="list list-5 compact">
[11:07:53] <taplar> was just curious.  i thought i remembered css having something like an eval method or something, but maybe that's scss
[11:08:10] <Cork> ya, that's scss
[11:08:35] <taplar> list-5 looks like it could be a bootstrap class anyway, lol
[11:08:44] <Cork> :)
[11:09:16] <Cork> i love moving style logic into css, it makes things to much easier to maintain
[11:09:37] <taplar> haven't i had a convo with you before though about people trying to stick too much logic in to css?
[11:09:46] <Cork> and text into html (makes translating much easier)
[11:10:08] <Cork> js should be toggling classes and similar
[11:11:16] <Cork> btw be careful with the all: unset; i used there; it is newish, and might not work in all browsers you need
[11:11:21] <Cork> (like ie and edge)
[11:11:39] <Cork> but you would have to set a fairly long list of values to do the same thing without it
[11:23:18] <ThatWebGuy> Cork and toplar thanks for the help
[11:23:27] <ThatWebGuy> taplar thanks for the help
[11:23:48] <taplar> that was all Cork, :)
[11:24:17] <ThatWebGuy> üëç
[14:22:25] <linux_daemon> hello guys, i have this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/fkaoLvwx/ it is a selectric plugin. now, as you can see, on line 3 i have console log, but it goes like this: first value: Colorado. change the value, it prints:ColoradoArisona, second change it goes: ColoradoTexas etc
[14:23:19] <robertmaxrees> can you add more code?  the related markup and the plugin, etc.
[14:23:24] <taplar> can you update that fiddle.....^^^^^
[14:23:46] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:23:52] <taplar> also not sure what line 11-13 is doing
[14:23:53] <robertmaxrees> without the markup, it's almost impossible to help.
[14:25:17] <linux_daemon> just a sec
[14:28:32] <linux_daemon> https://jsfiddle.net/fkaoLvwx/1/ and again, not sure how to add the selectric, lodash jquery libraries on the fiddle
[14:28:58] <taplar> left hand side has a Resources selection
[14:29:05] <taplar> you can add lodash and selectric there
[14:29:19] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/aa0KZcK.png
[14:29:41] <taplar> jQuery is selectable by clicking the "javaScript + no library" label above the bottom left iframe
[14:30:02] <robertmaxrees> ^ https://i.imgur.com/fLHiihH.png these :)
[14:31:33] <linux_daemon> https://jsfiddle.net/fkaoLvwx/2/ only to find selectric now and add it!
[14:31:34] <taplar> Side question, what was the reason for using "forOwn" instead of "forEach" ?
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> same process I showed you yesterday :)
[14:32:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vt5qk0s2/ with selectric
[14:32:54] <linux_daemon> selectric is js library, not css...let me see if i can find the external link to the library
[14:33:04] <robertmaxrees> they're both in there...
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/9qwHP5f.png
[14:33:25] <taplar> it's currently bombing because you're trying to += to an undefined variable
[14:33:33] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:33:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vt5qk0s2/2/
[14:34:05] <robertmaxrees> don't even need lodash for that.
[14:34:14] <taplar> Once that's fixed, the log looks fine
[14:34:59] <robertmaxrees> also your label munging looks kind of strange.  that should be in an if/else. setup, not two separate ifs.
[14:35:09] <robertmaxrees> like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vt5qk0s2/3/
[14:35:40] <taplar> but is there a point to the else statement?
[14:35:55] <taplar> loop over all elements, set their text.... to their text
[14:36:50] <linux_daemon> so the difference is .join('')...the else is put there because the dropdown is small, around 240px at most, so when i show it, i wanna show part of it and add ... at the end
[14:37:16] <robertmaxrees> i used a .map() instead of that lodash forOwn or whatever.
[14:37:21] <robertmaxrees> and don't do that with JS - use CSS for that.
[14:37:29] <taplar> but text() will get what it's current text is.  And then it uses what it's current text is, to set it's text value.  how would that change anything?
[14:37:43] <taplar> it's like saying a = a
[14:38:06] <linux_daemon> ah, i see...i will remove that part
[14:39:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vt5qk0s2/5/
[14:39:07] <robertmaxrees> just use CSS :)
[14:39:43] <taplar> doesn't seem to work in my firefox
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> works in mine.
[14:40:03] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[14:40:18] <taplar> 68.0.2
[14:40:38] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/LUniPHi.png
[14:41:05] <taplar> haha, nvm.  it doesn't have the ellipse in the dropdown is what I was seeing
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[14:41:27] <robertmaxrees> I didn't go that far with it - sounds like that's what they're looking for anyway.
[14:41:37] <taplar> yeah i just got confused
[14:42:10] <linux_daemon> hmm it still prints out the ColoradoMichigan when i put the code from your fiddle robertmaxrees
[14:42:24] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon update the fiddle to match your page then.
[14:43:02] <linux_daemon> i put the code you wrote on local and it is still printing as it was before
[14:43:11] <linux_daemon> tried with cache clear, same
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> also: we just showed that you don't need that js in the first place.
[14:43:31] <taplar> but, if you use it, does the fiddle replicate the issue?
[14:43:45] <taplar> do you see that same issue in the fiddle logs?
[14:43:55] <linux_daemon> no, the fiddle does not replicate the issue i am having
[14:44:07] <taplar> so the fiddle is your base line for looking at your actual code and finding what is different
[14:44:46] <linux_daemon> i'll take a deeper look , thanks everyone!
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon for giggles, do console.log($('.selectric .label').length);
[14:45:46] * robertmaxrees plays the jeopardy think music
[14:45:56] <taplar> :D
[14:46:09] <linux_daemon> hahaha :) let me clear the cache first, it is not clearing
[14:46:36] <taplar> what browser are you in?
[14:46:39] <linux_daemon> chrome
[14:47:09] <taplar> F12, go to the Network tab, find the "Disable cache" option, click it
[14:47:38] <linux_daemon> clicked it, it still reads the same page
[14:47:46] <linux_daemon> i mean the same cached
[14:47:54] <taplar> so that suggests its not a cache issue
[14:47:59] <robertmaxrees> you using service workers or something?
[14:48:13] <robertmaxrees> also, there a compilation step here?
[14:48:36] <linux_daemon> no service workers
[14:53:22] <linux_daemon> taplar: returns 2 ...
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees> so that's why.
[14:53:39] <robertmaxrees> you likely have two of these on the page.
[14:53:54] <linux_daemon> the other selectric is for mobile
[14:54:00] <linux_daemon> ow
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:54:12] <robertmaxrees> so don't init the one you don't need
[14:54:19] <robertmaxrees> or go full responsive.
[14:54:33] <linux_daemon> full responsive is the better thing here
[14:54:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:56:20] <on3pk> Shot in the dark type question.  Is $("input").each((i) => {});  async or synchronous?
[14:56:48] <robertmaxrees> synchronous
[14:57:04] <robertmaxrees> operations within that could be async though on3pk
[14:57:22] <on3pk> robertmaxrees, okay
[14:57:58] <on3pk> but changing the value of an input field, that I assume is synchronous?
[14:58:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:00:56] <on3pk> thanks
[17:07:43] <Exuma> i am using e.preventDefault(); in a submit. When I call $('#form').off('submit').submit(); nothing happens...... i could have sworn this used to work
[17:07:47] <Exuma> did something change or am i doing something wrong
[17:08:04] <robertmaxrees> did you update your version of jquery?
[17:08:04] <taplar> what is happening?
[17:08:10] <Exuma> literally nothing, it doesnt submit
[17:08:21] <robertmaxrees> can you show the html of the form?
[17:08:29] <taplar> and do you have any native event handlers on the form?
[17:09:49] <Exuma> no native handlers, really its a plain vanilla form using html5 validation. heres my JS
[17:10:06] <Exuma> https://pastebin.com/Q7mcyN0C
[17:10:22] <Exuma> im using 3.4.1
[17:11:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f7y80dmt/1/ basic concept works fine here.
[17:11:02] <robertmaxrees> which browser?
[17:12:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/f7y80dmt/2/ this uses 3.4.1 and still works fine.
[17:13:49] <Exuma> hmm
[17:13:51] <Exuma> im using chrome
[17:14:07] <Exuma> wtf
[17:14:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, works fine everywhere for me.  there's likely other code causing issues.
[17:14:33] <robertmaxrees> you don't happen to have anything bound to the submit button's click event, do you?
[17:15:00] <Exuma> no, there isnt from what i can see
[17:15:41] <Exuma> ah,.. its probably bootstrap messing with it perhaps
[17:15:42] <robertmaxrees> i'd inspect the element, go to "event listeners" and check from there.
[17:15:53] <taplar> out of curiosity, try changing it to: e.target.submit();
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> oooo that's a good'un.
[17:16:27] <robertmaxrees> also - console.log($('form
[17:16:37] <robertmaxrees> ** also - console.log($('form').length);
[17:18:13] <Exuma> ok if i do off('submit') it disappears from event listenrs
[17:18:19] <Exuma> and if i call .submit() on same form it literally doesnt do anything
[17:18:31] <taplar> the e.target.submit() doesn't change anything?
[17:18:33] <Exuma> length is 1
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> what's the form's action= set it?
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> *to
[17:18:57] <Exuma> "/checkout"
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> might be a delegated handler somewhere up the chain.
[17:19:36] <Exuma> e.target.submit is not a function
[17:19:44] <taplar> wha?
[17:19:48] <taplar> e.target should be the form
[17:19:58] <Exuma>     $('#home-form').submit(function(e) {
[17:19:58] <Exuma>       e.preventDefault();
[17:19:59] <Exuma>       e.target.submit();
[17:20:14] <taplar> console.log(e.target.tagName);
[17:20:37] <Exuma> "FORM"
[17:20:45] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[17:20:47] <taplar> wth.  i'm not going crazy, right robert?
[17:21:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.  something is WAY amiss.  can you share the form Exuma?
[17:21:21] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle?
[17:21:56] <Exuma> wow its some JS im including, NONE of which should be modifying the form......
[17:22:02] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/dLj4wf6z/
[17:22:08] <Exuma> i have to see what it is now
[17:22:10] <robertmaxrees> what's the code?
[17:22:23] <Exuma> i only have 2-3 scripts included .. none of them have to do with forms. its stuff like svg icons and such
[17:22:27] <Exuma> iim going to narrow it down
[17:22:52] <taplar> how many input fields are in the form?  and do you have an actual submit button in the form?
[17:23:20] <taplar> vaguely remember some gotcha with forms with multiple inputs without a submit button
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> some browsers don't play well with them.
[17:24:01] <robertmaxrees> but they said the handler is getting removed from the form when their code runs.
[17:24:23] <taplar> i thought the gotcha though was without the button it would not submit regardless
[17:24:32] <taplar> if you had two or more inputs
[17:25:21] <robertmaxrees> Maybe?  But that likely isn't the case here :)
[17:26:46] <taplar> meh, can't replicate that anyway
[17:30:14] <shoky> Exuma: did you name your submit button "submit" ?
[17:30:21] <Exuma> yes, the problem is this
[17:30:39] <Exuma> https://github.com/hilios/jQuery.countdown/blob/master/dist/jquery.countdown.js
[17:30:46] <Exuma> i have yet to find where though. when i remove that script it all works fine
[17:30:54] <Exuma> i have no idea how that breaks it
[17:31:48] <robertmaxrees> have any other code you can share?
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> also: any console errors?
[17:32:32] <Exuma> theres no errors in anything, somehow this script is like destroying the events
[17:33:00] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:33:02] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[17:33:10] <taplar> What elements are you using that on?
[17:33:46] <Exuma>  $('#clock').countdown().on()
[17:34:03] <taplar> what is the relation of the clock to the form?
[17:34:33] <Exuma> it is outside the form
[17:34:37] <taplar> :/
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if there's an issue with newer jquery and that plugin. it's almost 3 years old.
[17:35:12] <shoky> Exuma: that script doesn't do anything except add a method to jquery objects
[17:35:20] <shoky> Exuma: show your form html
[17:36:53] <Exuma> https://pastebin.com/dkdvPxCt
[17:37:00] <Exuma> yes youre right its because i assigned it under that and it was breaking
[17:37:06] <shoky> Exuma: <button id="submit" type="submit"
[17:37:11] <shoky> Exuma: change its id
[17:37:16] <taplar> lmao
[17:37:41] <taplar> i can't believe it.  this isn't the first time this has bit me that I didn't think to ask about that -_-
[17:37:53] <Exuma> ok
[17:37:56] <Exuma> what is the problem/?? wtf
[17:38:09] <taplar> the element is accessable on the for by it's id
[17:38:20] <taplar> so it's overriding the property so it's not the submit method
[17:38:24] <shoky> because chrome is dumb, because IE is dumb, or something
[17:38:26] <Exuma> fuckkkkkkkkkkk
[17:38:32] <Exuma> literally wtf i wasted so long on this
[17:38:35] <Exuma> THANK YOU
[17:38:38] <Exuma> i wanted to just die
[17:38:49] <taplar> sorry i didn't think about that.  the not a function should have been a flashing red light
[17:38:50] <Exuma> you even said that too, sorry
[17:39:03] <Exuma> he said it and i was duped by something else because i thought removing it was fixing it so i didnt try it
[17:39:03] <shoky> ;]
[17:39:20] <Exuma> oh my GOD i need some coffe.e......thank you. jeez, after all these years thats somehow never bit me
[17:39:35] <taplar> that's what you get when you wake up a shoky.  answers
[17:39:40] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:39:45] <robertmaxrees> s'why we like getting the markup :)
[17:40:14] <shoky> heh. all i did really was google "submit is not a function"
[17:40:23] <shoky> cause who remembers that shit
[17:40:24] <robertmaxrees> #programming
[17:40:37] <taplar> not me
[17:41:09] <Exuma> lol i know just the gif #programming is
[17:41:10] <Exuma> hahaha
[17:45:13] * taplar makes a mental note to add $('form #submit') to his debugging questions
[17:49:01] <taplar> reminds we i haven't been to codinglove in months
[22:28:59] <sydbarret> anybody here have used heroku?
