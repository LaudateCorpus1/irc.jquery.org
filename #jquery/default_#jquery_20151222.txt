[00:55:57] <eemgr> how would i check to see if an element contains an input of type text? (note: the element has checkboxes too)
[00:56:22] <eemgr> i tried myElement.has("input").is('text')
[00:57:31] <eemgr> oh i think i found it
[00:57:33] <eemgr> is('input:text')
[01:22:14] <kostodo> how can I select the previous elements child with class .close ?
[01:29:50] <C0nundrum> Hello if i'm recording and flv and ffmpeg is sundenly clossed

[01:38:01] <solifugus> Anyone know how to pass argument through jquery-ui dialog button function?
[01:38:15] <solifugus> I tried all day at work.. googling like nuts.. no solution.
[01:38:32] <solifugus> It's a callback.. for some reason, I couldn't even do it with a global.
[01:39:40] <Uhkis> kostodo: $(this).prev().find('.close');
[01:45:36] <kostodo> Uhkis, thanks
[02:10:41] <curiousmansi> http://jsfiddle.net/XaTCh/885/embedded/result/
[02:11:15] <curiousmansi> why it is not working on document
[02:11:20] <curiousmansi> but working on body
[02:11:30] <curiousmansi> any particular reason ?
[02:11:51] <kostodo> How would I select the nearest _previous_ element with a particular class?
[02:13:03] <slax0r> curiousmansi: document without quotes
[02:13:16] <slax0r> kostodo: .closest()?
[02:13:36] <slax0r> by previous I presume you mean parent
[02:13:47] <Uhkis> kostodo: you can add selector to prev()
[02:14:00] <kostodo> Can't seem to make it work.
[02:14:13] <slax0r> kostodo: can you make a fiddle?
[02:14:24] <kostodo> $(this).prev().closest('button.close')
[02:14:31] <kostodo> should closest be first?
[02:15:23] <slax0r> kostodo: .closest will traverse up the element tree, and return the first matching
[02:15:26] <slax0r> not sure you want this
[02:15:56] <kostodo> Yeah that sounds about right. So no need for .prev
[02:16:21] <slax0r> probably not
[02:17:16] <kostodo> Nah didnt work.
[02:29:28] <slax0r> kostodo: create a fiddle with an example of what you want
[02:29:44] <kostodo> OK, the markup is a bit of a mess to pull out its coming from a CMS.
[02:41:45] <arc_> kostodo .closest() looks at ancestors. if you want the nearest previous sibling matched by a class, you could do something like var previousSet = $('#parent').prevAll('.class'); previousSet.eq(previousSet.length - 1);
[02:42:41] <arc_> sorry, not #parent. that selector should select the element you are starting from
[02:43:38] <kostodo> arc_, trying to get the fiddle up in the meanwhile. but your answer has lost me.
[02:43:53] <arc_> what is confusing
[02:44:21] <kostodo> Let me try it out
[02:44:29] <arc_> .prev() only returns the directly previous element
[02:44:46] <arc_> .prevAll() returns all of the siblings that precede the one you selected
[02:44:57] <arc_> you can filter that by the class, which is what you wanted
[02:45:16] <arc_> but now you have a set of elements, not just the one that most directly precedes the one you selected
[02:45:33] <arc_> eq() allows you to select one element from a set, by an index
[02:45:49] <arc_> you know you want the closest one, which will be the highest index in the set
[02:45:56] <kostodo> understand
[02:46:00] <kostodo> but again its not working
[02:46:03] <kostodo> let me finish the fiddle
[02:46:09] <arc_> ok
[02:50:19] <hellyeah> i want to add div like an empty div for stating the graps between object. Do you have any suggestion for that? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/17/ . The idea in my mind is to add <div class="emptyDiv"></div> in template? What do you think?
[02:50:36] <arc_> kostodo hm, actually i guess prevAll returns them in the order they are found, not in the order they are in the dom. so you don't need to do previousSet.length - 1, you just need the index of 0
[02:51:11] <arc_> my bad
[02:51:16] <kostodo> let me try
[02:52:25] <kostodo> so previousSet.eq(0)?
[02:52:35] <arc_> so actually you can just simplify it to $('#startingNode').prevAll('.class').eq(0);
[02:53:31] <kostodo> didn't work though
[02:53:36] <arc_> ok lol
[02:53:38] <arc_> i'll look at your code
[02:53:44] <slax0r> hellyeah: just create a div element with $(document.createElement('div')) and append it to the dom
[02:53:51] <kostodo> :/ balls
[02:53:56] <kostodo> let me get that fiddle up
[02:58:41] <hellyeah> slax0r: is it like that https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/17/  line 15-16
[02:58:50] <kostodo> arc_, this is the best I can do with that markup http://jsfiddle.net/e27r8/1075/
[02:59:04] <arc_> okay, so what are we looking at
[02:59:11] <kostodo> arc_, basically each 'wrapper' contains a button.close but only the last one is exposed
[02:59:33] <kostodo> when you click the last one it will hide the whole wrapper, and .show() the previous close button
[03:00:07] <slax0r> hellyeah: a point of a fiddle is to inclode only relevant parts, not your whole novel of a code...
[03:00:18] <slax0r> lines 15-16 are some JSON on that fiddle
[03:00:21] <arc_> kostodo sorry, what am i clicking on ehre
[03:00:33] <arc_> the "From" that is a link?
[03:00:36] <kostodo> 'Close' button at the end
[03:00:43] <arc_> okay
[03:00:48] <kostodo> there is one per row
[03:01:01] <kostodo> only the lasts one is displayed rest are on display: none
[03:01:12] <kostodo> sorry for the shite fiddle
[03:01:21] <arc_> okay, so what element are you trying to select
[03:03:08] <kostodo> the previous button.close
[03:03:21] <hellyeah> slax0r: i changed the little bit  i meantioned line wrong sorry  line 32 -34
[03:03:23] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/18/
[03:03:46] <arc_> ok, so it's not a previous sibling
[03:03:58] <arc_> when do you want to select it, when someone clicks on this close button?
[03:04:33] <kostodo> arc_, see here: http://jsfiddle.net/e27r8/1076/
[03:05:08] <kostodo> arc_, updated to have button click close hide the whole active row
[03:05:27] <kostodo> arc_, but after that code the previous rows button.close should now be displayed
[03:05:43] <kostodo> Heh. Hope that makes sense
[03:06:10] <arc_> i only see one button.close
[03:06:28] <arc_> oh. i guess my browser's ctrl+f isn't working properly
[03:07:51] <arc_> i mean, if it's not based on previous siblings this is easy
[03:09:05] <kostodo> button.close you only see one in the HTML?
[03:09:14] <kostodo> only the last one is displayed. others are on display: none
[03:09:16] <kostodo> but they're there
[03:09:19] <arc_> nah it was just my browser messing up
[03:10:59] <kostodo> arc_, ah ok.
[03:12:19] <hellyeah> hey what am i missin here? I added emptydiv for creating space between object but it doesnt work as i expected. I expect the see the button become while text become longer and need to see same space everytime. Is there any suggestion? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/19/
[03:12:33] <kostodo> arc_, so does it make sense to you?
[03:13:14] <arc_> yeah. i'm just working out how to do this really quick
[03:14:32] <arc_> kostodo http://jsfiddle.net/e27r8/1077/
[03:15:02] <kostodo> not working right
[03:15:09] <kostodo> it should be closing them one by one in order
[03:15:16] <kostodo> with only ever the last one having a close button
[03:15:53] <arc_> well .. i mean, you only asked about how to select the previous button, not how to hide your divs or whatever else you were talking about :p
[03:16:09] <kostodo> heh
[03:16:18] <kostodo> sure, but its not always selecting the previous button
[03:16:19] <kostodo> try it
[03:16:35] <arc_> oh i see what i did here
[03:16:38] <arc_> lol that was dumb
[03:18:11] <kostodo> ?
[03:18:44] <arc_> well, because this html is so confusing i'm not entirely sure whether i'm missing something or not, but here http://jsfiddle.net/e27r8/1078/
[03:19:28] <arc_> i mean i can see that at some point there is no button remaining
[03:19:49] <arc_> it seems like the correct button is being displayed each time until that point
[03:20:21] <kostodo> something weird is happening
[03:22:33] <arc_> i don't see close1 anywhere
[03:23:30] <arc_> maybe there isn't supposed to be one
[03:25:34] <arc_> i added a close1 button and now it works as much like i would think it should work as i can figure out
[03:47:43] <iaj> Hit here :)
[03:48:11] <iaj> What can I use if want to add a certain funciton to the very end before a form gets submitted?
[03:48:46] <iaj> I just tried on('click' â€¦) but that seems to be called at first
[04:39:40] <Uhkis> submit
[04:40:02] <Uhkis> iaj: on('submit' ..)
[05:09:58] <john-dev> how can i prevent jquery from sending a cookie along with a $.ajax request
[05:24:56] <emilkarl> Any idea why this code does a GET request instead of a put? jQuery 2.1.4 http://pastie.org/10646938
[05:30:25] <john-dev> PUT does not accept parameters
[05:31:44] <emilkarl> ah!
[05:32:07] <emilkarl> so I should create a query string instead and use only URL?
[05:32:26] <john-dev> yes.. be aware that not all browsers support PUT while testing
[05:33:01] <john-dev> well, your data needs to be a string rather than an object, because objects become converted to querystrings
[07:25:52] <hellyeah> hey
[07:30:05] <hellyeah> ps check line 55-57 in order to make height of buttonsandcounters i wrote the function. What do you think about this? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/28/
[07:38:15] <lichenx1> hellyeah the buttons turn half transparent for me
[07:44:12] <hellyeah> half transparent
[07:44:33] <hellyeah> what do you mean i dont understand i didnt even give background-color to button
[07:44:36] <hellyeah> _
[07:46:17] <lichenx1> one sec
[07:46:56] <lichenx1> http://puu.sh/m4IlE/e85cbe2bf3.png
[07:46:58] <lichenx1> on hover
[07:47:08] <lichenx1> is that normal?
[07:47:24] <hellyeah> nothing here
[07:47:31] <lichenx1> ?
[07:47:42] <hellyeah> i didnt see anythingh on that address
[07:47:46] <taplar> transparent background css
[07:47:55] <hellyeah> juyst white page
[07:48:03] <hellyeah> hey taplar how is it going?
[07:48:09] <lichenx1> works for me hmm
[07:48:13] <taplar> pretty good
[07:48:15] <hellyeah> do i need to repeat my question :)
[07:48:42] <taplar> the thing lichenx1 is talking about is your doing transparent background on hover of those buttons
[07:48:54] <taplar> combined with the black text on a black background it looks like it disappears
[07:49:14] <taplar> but yeah, what's your question?
[07:52:05] <hellyeah> ah
[07:52:09] <hellyeah> yeah
[07:52:18] <hellyeah> this is because buttonsandcounters is black
[07:53:13] <hellyeah> lichenx1: check it out now https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/30/
[07:53:44] <hellyeah> taplar: ps check line 55-57 in order to make height of buttonsandcounters i wrote the function. What do you think about this? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/30/
[07:54:07] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[07:54:52] <hellyeah> okey
[07:54:58] <hellyeah> let me show you one more thing
[07:55:27] <taplar> i can see what your logic is doing.  i just need to know what your 'trying' to do.  so i can advise you
[07:55:37] <hellyeah> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/32/
[07:55:45] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[07:55:49] <hellyeah> let me try to explain
[07:56:52] <hellyeah> text inside the button can be longer. I used break-word in css  line 85 and text can be 100 characters may be so i plan to expand the button and also expand the buttonscounters div
[07:57:01] <hellyeah> this is what i am trying to go
[07:57:09] <hellyeah> btw 27 is just estimated number
[07:58:08] <taplar> so your trying to make all the buttons the same height?
[07:59:03] <Sarelle> actually no
[07:59:06] <Sarelle> hmm
[07:59:14] <Sarelle> let me explain like that just give me a sec
[08:01:24] <Sarelle> some button can have long text some can have short ones i try to create div for every button to avoid confliction you see here https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/34/
[08:02:12] <Sarelle> i just try to create dynamic div for every button.
[08:02:32] <Sarelle> so button can be big or small because of its text but i can have clean view
[08:02:56] <taplar> ok, so what's the issue?
[08:02:58] <Sarelle> hope you goy my intention
[08:03:18] <taplar> other than some buttons are appearing on top of other buttons
[08:03:48] <Sarelle> yeah but i try show every button without causing any confliction
[08:04:04] <taplar> what are you calling a conflict?
[08:05:48] <Sarelle> sorry for my english
[08:06:00] <Sarelle> if a button seems on another button
[08:06:03] <Sarelle> like overlap
[08:06:16] <taplar> k, then you need to figure out why that is happening
[08:06:24] <taplar> it's happening due to how your using position: absolute
[08:08:13] <Sarelle> hmm,
[08:08:20] <Sarelle> buttonClass?
[08:08:38] <Sarelle> sorry buttons
[08:08:47] <taplar> possibly, not sure
[08:10:01] <taplar> what is the field div for?
[08:10:28] <Sarelle> ah yes thats something https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/37/
[08:10:39] <Sarelle> field is not necessary i will remove it
[08:13:41] <Sarelle> taplar: what do you think now? https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/40/
[08:14:31] <taplar> looks like you don't have any overlapping
[08:14:49] <Sarelle> yes i dont have it now
[08:15:02] <Sarelle> counters and buttons needs to be overlapped
[08:15:39] <Sarelle> in line 60 css i used position:absolute; do you think it is right approach
[08:17:24] <taplar> i'm looking.  there seems to be a lot of css for just this little test case
[08:17:35] <Sarelle> hmm
[08:17:52] <Sarelle> i try to be better everyday thats what i can do now
[08:18:01] <Sarelle> if you give suggestion i will appreciate it
[08:23:25] <Sarelle> brb
[08:34:01] <Mark____> is there something more sensitive to mouse click than jquery on.click?
[08:34:29] <taplar> what are you looking for?
[08:35:05] <Mark____> um, itâ€™s dificult to explain.
[08:35:24] <Mark____> basically, i want to active the class by mouse clicking,
[08:36:15] <taplar> what in the click handler are you seeing that is not sensitive enough for you?
[08:36:32] <Mark____> but it would be better if i can do so by the simple click- i mean even when i donâ€™t let go of the mouse on the element.
[08:36:35] <Mark____> um,
[08:36:48] <taplar> oh
[08:37:04] <Mark____> itâ€™s complicated. but you got what im trying to get
[08:38:09] <taplar> try mousedown
[08:40:48] <Mark____> thanks.
[08:42:08] <iaj> Uhkis: that on('submit') you mentioned before (thx btw)-- will that also work if I got custom validation active on the page?  Or with which (client/server-side verification/validation) is it gonna work?
[08:50:49] <Bogdaniel> i'm having trouble with append to div information because if i change it it just doubles i know i have to use empty before appending but i'm not sure how to do it in the context http://pastebin.com/CaJxze63
[08:53:24] <slax0r> Bogdaniel: make a jsfiddle
[08:54:02] <Mark____> um, can anyone help me with the jquery slider? i basically made this slider that adjusts the width of the body by dragging it around left and right. the only problem is making the content auto adjust its margin so that it stays horizontally in the middle. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/today#
[08:57:20] <ange7> hey
[08:57:42] <ange7> is it possible to set cookie in ajax request with JQuery on Internet Explorer ?

[09:00:49] <Bogdaniel> slax0r https://jsfiddle.net/suu44hgu/1/ this would be the html output and t he entire javascript
[09:03:38] <hellyeah> is it valid to calculate the width of letter?
[09:03:54] <tuskkk___> is it possible to write, on click of this, or on change of that, do xyz?
[09:04:31] <taplar> tuskkk___: would be two statements, but you could give both the same method
[09:05:06] <tuskkk___> yea, that's what I thought...
[09:05:08] <hellyeah> change and click is seperate events right
[09:05:17] <taplar> yuo
[09:05:19] <tuskkk___> yes
[09:05:19] <taplar> yup
[09:05:19] <hellyeah> one belongs to button the other belongs to checkbox
[09:05:24] <taplar> no
[09:05:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:05:30] <taplar> they can be on most anything
[09:05:33] <taplar> except change
[09:06:02] <hellyeah> click can be used for everything change is limited to some elements ic
[09:06:14] <taplar> but technically you could still put it on and trigger('change') so it can be on anything too
[09:06:41] <hellyeah> ic
[09:07:43] <hellyeah> btw any respond to my question?
[09:08:52] <taplar> i'm only have here now.

[09:21:45] <hellyeah> i didnt see your question
[09:22:30] <ange7> hellyeah:
[09:22:31] <xerium> Anyone familar with HammerJS for working with gestures on mobile? I'm having an issue with Hammer removing event handlers and not allowing my existing buttons to function properly. Tried domEvents option with no luck. Any help greatly appreciated.
[09:22:33] <ange7> <ange7> is it possible to set cookie in ajax request with JQuery on Internet Explorer ?

[09:23:46] <hellyeah> ajax should have something for cookie
[09:23:59] <hellyeah> did you check ajax jquery?
[09:25:01] <ange7> Ajax Jquery?
[09:26:06] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[09:28:15] <xerium> Anyone at all familiar with HammerJS?
[09:30:01] <ange7> hellyeah: nothing in documentation to make working cookie in ajax
[09:30:38] <matyus> xerium: what's your issue? Hammerjs mysteriously unbinds the event handlers?
[09:31:36] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16851896/how-to-set-cookie-value-with-ajax-request
[09:39:44] <xerium> matyus yes, unbinding
[09:41:05] <xerium> it's been driving me crazy the last 3 days. matyus, do you have any info that can help with this?
[09:43:17] <matyus> xerium: you're certain there's no typos anywhere?
[09:48:19] <skione> morning
[09:53:57] <xerium> matyus, no typos. no errors in console. i tried adding domEvents: true to both the manager and also the set options method and unbinding is still occurring
[09:56:40] <matyus> xerium: interesting, are you able to share the code on github or jsfiddle or something
[09:59:36] <skione> xerium, go ahead and share the code its fine
[09:59:43] <xerium> matyus, code is part of a large company site so it would be impossible to add to a fiddle. do you know if there is anything additional that has to be done to allow event handlers to remain untouched?
[10:00:57] <skione> can't you break down the essential components?
[10:04:56] <matyus> xerium: have you tried to put a console.log('something happened') in the handler? maybe the issue is something else? seems really bizarre that a handler would randomly unbind
[10:05:26] <matyus> unless you have code somewhere else that's unbinding things without you knowing it
[10:16:12] <xerium> matyus, heres a jsfiddle for Hammer: https://jsfiddle.net/enjazcjh/1/ need to view on mobile device
[10:20:55] <xerium> matyus, the unbinding is only happening when using Hammer or any other gesture library. It seems like they are doing something to minimize jerky movements and such with gestures so something has to be going wrong somewhere. On desktop it works fine but on mobile when gesture recognizers are in place it's crippling the event handlers.
[10:21:16] <iaj> hey there, does someone know, when I use a validation system like parsley.js... is it somehow possible to have a call to the following fragment: http://pastie.org/10647378 but only after validation succeeds?
[10:21:27] <iaj> sorry I can't manage to figure it out :(
[10:22:49] <matyus> xerium: I just tried it on my iphone and I can't reproduce what you're talking about with the unbinding
[10:24:22] <xerium> matyus, when you click the pink "button" you get an alert??
[10:25:45] <matyus> xerium: oooh I see
[10:29:59] <xerium> if i remove the hammer library and hammer JS the alert works fine, so... the gesture JS libraries are doing something and it's horrible because I need to be able to handle events while detecting gestures.
[10:44:23] <iaj> When I have a call to jQuery('form') and then have a function { }   how can I select .fooclass inside the current form?
[10:44:42] <xerium> *resolved!* I need to add the mobile equivalent of their tap event to every single handler where I have click. For some reason click isn't good enough when detecting the gestures.
[10:45:24] <NoiseEee> iaj: can you break that down into something more understandable
[10:46:41] <iaj> NoiseEee: heh, im sorry not a native english speaker.. is it common to do this.find('selector')  or is that not a good awy?
[10:46:45] <iaj> way*
[10:49:53] <NoiseEee> iaj: sure that is fine
[10:50:19] <NoiseEee> $('form').on('click','.onlyAParticularClass',function() {})
[10:50:48] <matyus> xerium: awesome
[10:52:00] <iaj> NoiseEee: :) thanks!
[11:12:25] <ABM_Dan> Say I have a checkbox that disables all the fields in the form except itself, how do I remove it from the selection?
[11:13:33] <NoiseEee> ABM_Dan: .not(), perhaps
[11:13:38] <ABM_Dan> Right now I have $(':input',$('input[type=checkbox]').filter("[data-action='lock-fieldset']").closest('form')).attr('disabled','disabled');
[11:13:50] <pe> I, i would like to get the first <p> of a dom element. I use mynode.find("p:first-child"); The problem is that in "mynode" i have <p></p> <div><p></p></div> , and the <p> inside the <div> is caught too !! how can i modify the selector to avoid that ? thx
[11:14:07] <ABM_Dan> can I do .not($(this)) ?
[11:14:11] <NoiseEee> ABM_Dan: yes
[11:14:18] <ABM_Dan> k.
[11:15:00] <NoiseEee> pe: someElement.find('p').first()
[11:15:19] <pe> NoiseEee: I would like to do it with a selector
[11:15:32] <NoiseEee> why
[11:15:40] <pe> writing a scrapper
[11:15:54] <NoiseEee> pe: ?
[11:15:57] <pe> hmm i can do that but must modify a bit of my model
[11:16:04] <NoiseEee> pe:  mynode.find("p:first-child"); to  mynode.find("p").first();
[11:16:10] <pe> i loose the "easy configuration" of my scrapper
[11:16:52] <NoiseEee> there's no way to just get that first element without adding something to your code.
[11:17:07] <pe> okey
[11:17:13] <pe> thx
[11:17:17] <NoiseEee> np
[11:23:39] <pe> NoiseEee: currently i do node.find(pattern).filter(function() { /* parse here */}); With what you told me, i think i need to do before_filter(node.find(pattern)).filter(function() { /* parse here */ }); if in before_filter(nodes) I return nodes.first(); will it work ?
[11:24:11] <pe> or have I to use some "not" function ?
[11:24:33] <NoiseEee> pe: make up a jsfiddle and see
[11:24:39] <NoiseEee> pe: the "not" was not aimed to you
[11:24:49] <pe> if i treat the first
[11:24:55] <pe> i wont do a function espacially for it
[11:25:02] <pe> need to cover more functionnalities
[11:25:26] <NoiseEee> im not sure what you're filtering or what your code is, so i can't advise.  but if you do want the first something and only the first, there is no magic selector, you have to use javascript/jquery
[11:25:31] <pe> before_filter allows to perform any call I want before the filter
[11:25:44] <pe> yy
[11:25:50] <pe> seems good
[11:31:40] <droopy> What's the best way to get the value for an inline style, where the style attr has many styles?
[11:32:05] <droopy> style="margin-top: 1em, margin-bottom: 1em"; How to extract margin-top's value?
[11:34:45] <taplar_afk> .css('margin-top')
[11:49:16] <pe> NoiseEee: it works. :)
[11:49:26] <pe> thx
[11:49:33] <NoiseEee> np pe
[11:57:25] <al-damiri> How can I parse the query string parameters in the URL?
[11:57:35] <robertmaxrees> using regex
[11:57:55] <robertmaxrees> http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/ has some good info.
[11:57:55] <al-damiri> No built-in helper methods in jQuery (or any other library for that matter)?
[11:58:02] <robertmaxrees> not in jquery, no.
[11:58:17] <robertmaxrees> dunno what other libraries you're using so it's hard to suggest ideas.
[11:58:53] <al-damiri> not using any other but open to do so (does underscore.js/lodash have this functionality?)\
[11:59:13] <robertmaxrees> don't bring in an entire other library just because you need to parse URLs - check out the page i linked.
[11:59:32] <robertmaxrees> and no, underscore/lodash don't have that functionality.
[11:59:59] <al-damiri> robertmaxrees: ah, right. okay. checking it out, thanks.
[12:07:47] <al-damiri> Is it possible to write cookies in a JS file served from exampleA.com for another domain exampleB.com?
[12:09:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:12:38] <al-damiri> I have a page and JS file served from one domain, where I take username & password, authenticate with a web service. Once it is authenticate the web service returns some tokens.
[12:13:02] <al-damiri> Which I append to the URL which I have to redirect to and then I'm able to access the page.
[12:13:52] <al-damiri> Now instead of appending the token in the URL, I want to set it as a cookie so that on the other page, the client is able to retrieve all the related files to a URL (JS, CSS files etc.)
[12:14:17] <al-damiri> Otherwise I would have come up with a mechanism to modify the URLs in that page to contain the token in their query string.
[12:14:35] <robertmaxrees> errr, so you're setting cookies for one domain and want to access them on another?
[12:14:43] <al-damiri> yes.
[12:14:56] <al-damiri> I would want to do that, is it possible?
[12:15:33] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that - you'll need to work around that limitation.
[12:15:41] <robertmaxrees> search google for cross-domain cookies
[12:15:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll see a wealth of information.
[12:15:54] <al-damiri> ah okay thanks for the hint.
[12:16:28] <al-damiri> I was thinking of having a public page in that other domain, which'll parse the tokens in the query string, set the cookies and then redirect to the intended place.
[12:16:30] <al-damiri> Is this a good idea?
[12:17:28] <robertmaxrees> you need to do a lot of reading on the subject - it's also way off topic for this channel :)
[12:18:21] <al-damiri> ok sorry, no worries, thanks. I'll look up on 'cross-domain cookies'.
[12:18:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:34:58] <tgodar> existing code base which worked fine is now having issues with a certain Xhr request.  Chrome just says net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET, looking at chrome's net-internals events but am still stumped.  Any ideas?
[12:35:19] <tgodar> issue started on new httpd environment
[12:36:56] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24931566/getting-error-in-console-failed-to-load-resource-neterr-connection-reset
[12:39:21] <tgodar> robertmaxrees: nothing that really applies there but thanks
[12:39:48] <robertmaxrees> dunno how else you expect any help, but sure!
[12:39:59] <robertmaxrees> you might have more luck in a channel about that server/servers in general.
[12:52:10] <BoomBoxUser> Hi I am planning to make something like a RAD(Just started) for PHP. How can I make Jquery print a formatted code? As of now it works but prints a ugly code : http://pastebin.com/vsar4dXk
[12:52:28] <robertmaxrees> "prints a ugly code"?
[12:52:51] <BoomBoxUser> hi robertmaxrees, It does not look good is what I meant. :)
[12:52:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want a code formatter of some kind?
[12:53:21] <BoomBoxUser> Yes, that's what I intend to do with <?php tag at the start
[12:53:22] <eindoofus> i'm trying to use ajax on an api that seems to require basic auth for retrieving data. after user "beforeSend" with the Authorization header my code results in two api calls, one passes but doesn't return a data response, while the second fails. is this to be expected?
[12:53:38] <robertmaxrees> BoomBoxUser see if you can't find a server-side solution instead.
[12:54:13] <robertmaxrees> eindoofus you might be seeing a preflight request but i'm not sure.
[12:54:28] <BoomBoxUser> I thought it would be easy to make this in Jquery, it works now just wanted to add text <?php at the start
[12:54:49] <robertmaxrees> BoomBoxUser why do you want to use jquery?  are you serving the content up from the server?
[12:54:50] <BoomBoxUser> and format the code a bit so that it looks good for users
[12:55:08] <BoomBoxUser> Nope :) Not serving from server
[12:55:11] <robertmaxrees> BoomBoxUser then use PHP.
[12:55:14] <taplar_afk> what is a RAD?
[12:55:25] <BoomBoxUser> Rapid application development
[12:55:58] <taplar_afk> your wanting to make a text editor with jquery?
[12:56:02] <BoomBoxUser> robertmaxrees, when user clicks a button, I want them to get the code. That's it. Thus it's upto them to put it on server. My page will just generate code
[12:56:15] <robertmaxrees> then the page should output the code in the proper format.
[12:56:19] <BoomBoxUser> taplar_afk, nope :) Just answered.
[12:56:31] <robertmaxrees> jquery is the wrong tool for this job :)
[12:57:01] <robertmaxrees> read up for syntax highlighers.
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> and look around at your options.
[12:57:26] <BoomBoxUser> robertmaxrees, hmm, okay. Just to display code to users. I heart there are a few plugins for formatting such as prettyJS
[12:57:37] <robertmaxrees> BoomBoxUser there are plenty of options in JS, but you don't need them.
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> you really should have something that formats the code properly server-side and then styles it accordingly.
[12:58:24] <BoomBoxUser> robertmaxrees, sure. I will try exploring other options. Thanks for your input. :D
[13:08:14] <fury_> quick and possibly stupid question. If I, say, $('#something').html('<div id="somethingElse">');, immediately after, $('#somethingElse') is empty. anything stupid I could be missing?
[13:08:34] <robertmaxrees> you're not repeating #something are you?
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> and how are you verifying it has content?
[13:08:49] <fury_> I mean it's physically on the page so..
[13:09:51] <fury_> you mean are there multiple #something's yes? there aren't
[13:10:07] <robertmaxrees> okay, and how are you verifying if there's content?
[13:10:12] <fury_> looking at the page?
[13:10:22] <robertmaxrees> that's... not helpful.
[13:10:24] <fury_> inspecting the elements?
[13:10:31] <fury_> the content is right there on the page
[13:10:37] <taplar> $('#somethingElse').length < 1 ?
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> so you see it or don't?
[13:10:54] <fury_> I see it, yet $('#somethingElse') is empty
[13:10:56] <fury_> taplar: sec
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> what do you get if you do $('[id="somethingElse"]').length, instead of #something else?
[13:11:27] <fury_> taplar: $('#somethingElse').length == 0, yes
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> maybe your #something selector is bad.
[13:12:08] <fury_> robertmaxrees: $('[id="somethingElse"]').length == 0
[13:12:11] <fury_> yet it's there on the page
[13:12:20] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[13:13:02] <fury_> I don't have this anywhere public, but I think I may have just spotted it.
[13:13:03] <taplar> i wonder if he's running into a document ready issue
[13:13:16] <robertmaxrees> fury_ you can make a fiddle ;)
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[13:13:31] <fury_> the vast majority of this file isn't my code, and I'm not all that adept at JS
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> we just want the bits that are relevant ;)
[13:13:48] <fury_> I think that div is actually being added to the DOM after this code runs
[13:13:49] <taplar> learning is fun
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:14:01] <fury_> which would make sense.
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> so it's not in the order you think it is?
[13:15:34] <fury_> yeah, you know how JS can get a little funky sometimes with anonymous functions etc.
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to understand.
[13:16:09] <taplar> you can always go too crazy with them, but that's more of just a design flaw
[13:16:30] <fury_> if you've been doing JS for awhile, made the rest of an 800 line source file, sure. but neither is the case for me. I'm usually the back-end guy.
[13:16:58] <robertmaxrees> "back-end" can include JS now ;) what language do you normally work with?
[13:16:59] <fury_> I've been working in this file for only about half an hour. and to be fair I did spot it :)
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> or languages?
[13:17:04] <fury_> python, C++
[13:17:35] <fury_> and yeah I know it can be back-end now hehe
[13:17:38] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah, it shouldn't take too long for you to build up the mental models you'd need to understand the language.
[13:19:06] <BoomBoxUser> robertmaxrees, just found something as you advised. It works fine. It was a server side class called as Geshi which works fine. Thanks again.
[13:19:19] <robertmaxrees> BoomBoxUser rad.
[13:19:25] <fury_> yeah I'm not too worried about it. I originally just asked because I figured I may have missed something stupid. I did find the issue though, I was right - that stuff hadn't actually been added to DOM yet.
[13:19:35] <fury_> moved some stuff around and it works now. thanks!
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> errr, 'kay.
[13:20:45] <fury_> heh I mean, I *did* miss something stupid
[13:21:08] <fury_> I mean something more along the lines of some common newbie jquery mistake
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> i get worred when I hear "moved some stuff around", but okay.
[13:21:39] <fury_> it's in the right spot now, no worries. if anything it was in a weird spot before.
[13:21:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[13:44:22] <huck5> Hey, I'm wondering what the best way to import jQuery Mobile libraries into a jsFiddle is..
[13:44:55] <robertmaxrees> select jquery 2.1.0 and you have a checkbox for jqm.
[13:45:24] <huck5> robertmaxrees, in the jsfiddle.net that I see now (which i believe was recently updated?) I no longer see the dropdown to select what jQuery version I want to use..
[13:45:43] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon next to the "javascript" title in that box.
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/jzYPO38.png
[13:46:08] <huck5> robertmaxrees, exactly what I needed. Thanks a bunch!
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:51:58] <huck5> I have an absolute-positioned select list, where all values are only 2 characters (E.g. "EN", "FR"). I have this select list displayed on the same line as a text-input. But the select-list is squished, and the down-arrow overlaps the "EN" selected text... Any suggestions?
[13:52:32] <huck5> I'm having a bit of trouble replicating in a fiddle. I just thought someone might have a suggestion off the top of their head
[13:52:57] <taplar> squished
[13:53:27] <huck5> Well, it's thinner than it would be if it was displayed on its own line..
[13:54:23] <taplar> you could try styling it so it is wider *shrug*
[13:55:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're having a conflict with other style.s
[14:00:09] <huck5> robertmaxrees, i think that is what's going on. Thanks.
[14:00:23] <huck5> taplar, also good advise, thank you.
[14:00:40] <taplar> blasphemy
[14:02:26] <eindoofus> is there any library to help handle paging of an api in jquery?
[14:02:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:03:20] <eindoofus> robertmaxrees, the more i think about it the less sense it makes. sorry, quick to jump the gun on questions
[14:03:29] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[14:05:21] <eindoofus> have a fixed pagesize that the api returns and need to cycle through the pages till i reach the last page in order to retrieve the data since i'm not sure what the max pagesize it can handle is
[14:06:01] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a lot of data.
[14:06:39] <eindoofus> i guess i should play with the api before jumping through those hurdles since i'm not requesting that much
[14:07:10] <taplar> hopefully the api itself supports paging
[14:07:32] <eindoofus> don't believe so
[14:07:37] <taplar> egh
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> errr
[14:07:42] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:08:45] <eindoofus> guess depends on what that question means. i can set parameters in the call for the index of the next start item and pagesize, but there is no url in the json returned to grab and goto
[14:09:03] <robertmaxrees> so the API is paginated.
[14:09:15] <robertmaxrees> why are you crawling it to get everything out?
[14:11:05] <eindoofus> what's the alternative? besides using trying out a larger pagesize that should encompass everything (but not guaranteed)
[14:11:13] <robertmaxrees> err.
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> why are you crawling it to get everything out?
[14:12:32] <eindoofus> to give users the ability to select available items. building a simpler ui just for what i need on top of it
[14:12:41] <eindoofus> current ui is bloated
[14:12:44] <robertmaxrees> do you have control over the API then?
[14:12:50] <eindoofus> no
[14:12:53] <eindoofus> third-party
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> then do this server-side.
[14:13:08] <eindoofus> why?
[14:13:27] <robertmaxrees> that way you can clean up the data and not burden the client with the extra requests.
[14:13:54] <robertmaxrees> usually APIs are setup like that to discourage you from grabbing everything they've got - if you really want to do it, at least don't make the client do all the extra work in ajax requests.
[14:14:13] <eindoofus> it's not a lot of data though
[14:14:32] <eindoofus> and not that many end points i'm hitting
[14:14:34] <robertmaxrees> each request will still be expensive.
[14:15:23] <eindoofus> but if i do it server-side then it'll be  API -> BACKEND -> CLIENT
[14:15:28] <eindoofus> versus API -> CLIENT
[14:15:35] <robertmaxrees> yep.  but the client does a single DNS lookup/etc.
[14:15:49] <robertmaxrees> so you skip all that overhead.
[14:16:27] <eindoofus> an i skip the lookup if i use an ip instead?
[14:16:29] <eindoofus> can*
[14:16:37] <robertmaxrees> that's silly.
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[14:16:45] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[14:16:52] <eindoofus> not if there is a way to look up the ip one time
[14:17:32] <eindoofus> give up? that's harsh. your asking me to double code and learn a backend framework for a fairly simple app
[14:17:46] <eindoofus> while i'm still learning js/jquery
[14:18:05] <eindoofus> there are more variables at play
[14:18:47] <eindoofus> what a demoralizing conversation..
[14:46:50] <otahak> hey folks. trying to use .on() to set a button's actions even when the button was generated through .append() - not sure I'm using the selector arg properly. could some one eli5?
[14:48:07] <NoiseEee> otahak: if the button isn't there when the listener is running, it won't get one
[14:48:10] <Uhkis> you need to set big brother to watch over the incoming immigrants :-D
[14:48:16] <NoiseEee> otahak: this is why people use 'event delegation'
[14:48:22] <islalobo> I have questions about analytics.js, is this the place to ask?
[14:48:31] <otahak> NoiseEee - that's what I was hoping to figure out
[14:48:51] <NoiseEee> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ @ otahak
[14:48:59] <Uhkis> big brother being something thats already in there and immigrants those guys who come later
[14:49:10] <otahak> I have a button that gets added through append() - it works the first time, but not when it's been "appended"
[14:49:15] <otahak> ouh, thanks NoiseEee
[14:49:21] <NoiseEee> np
[14:50:20] <Uhkis> $(bigbro).on('event', 'immigrant-selector', function() .....
[14:51:00] <otahak> y'know - it must be something else then. Cos' I tried exactly that (simply swapping out my .click() for .on() with proper args) - and it didnt work
[14:51:18] <otahak> let me put it in pastebin. just a tic
[14:51:49] <otahak> here it is before the .on() swap out
[14:51:49] <otahak> http://pastebin.com/PMqZ7Lej
[14:56:34] <NoiseEee> you're missing the point
[14:56:50] <NoiseEee> and don't use .click() use .on()
[14:57:17] <otahak> haha, I understand that sir. what i mean is I must not be implementing it properly, cos it doesn't seem to make a lick of difference when implemented.
[14:57:29] <NoiseEee> otahak: don't listen on button elements, listen on the PARENT
[14:57:42] <Uhkis> lets try another analogy
[14:57:46] <otahak> so, 2nd arg for .on() is the parent?
[14:58:04] <NoiseEee> someParentReference.on('click','button',function() { //whoa, any button now or in the future will fire this callback!! });
[14:58:13] <NoiseEee> otahak: no, the listener is on the parent.  ^^
[14:58:24] <otahak> ohhh, okay. will give that a crack. thanks for your patience, guys.
[14:58:59] <otahak> so instead of targetting #button - target #button > parent (#parent) and select '#button' as 2nd arg
[14:59:25] <NoiseEee> right
[15:00:11] <Uhkis> $(parent-that-exists-in-dom).on('event', 'child-to-be-added', function() ...
[15:00:18] <otahak> ^
[15:01:05] <Uhkis> on another note, please don't use pastebin, use jsfiddle.net instead
[15:01:34] <NoiseEee> also, 'child-to-be-added' obv. would work with children already present as well
[15:02:05] <otahak> well, this will be occuring *after* the .append
[15:02:13] <otahak> so the button in question will already exist in dom
[15:02:17] <otahak> just not the original instance
[15:03:03] <otahak> okay. so here's what I have/did
[15:03:07] <otahak> $( '#searchbar' ).on('click', '#btn_search', function()
[15:03:37] <Uhkis> now there's a problem, you can't add another element with the same id
[15:03:52] <otahak> well, it didnt work in either case
[15:04:05] <otahak> so my question is - can I not selectbyid in the 2nd arg?
[15:04:23] <Uhkis> id's are unique
[15:04:38] <otahak> so I cant use an ID?
[15:04:50] <otahak> (this was all built under the assumption Id need IDs)
[15:04:56] <Uhkis> use a class for multiple ones
[15:05:07] <otahak> well, its just the one button. it just disappears and reappears as needed.
[15:05:19] <Uhkis> then it should be fine
[15:05:20] <otahak> let me jsfiddle it for you, just a sec
[15:06:24] <otahak> https://jsfiddle.net/twj4cjdk/
[15:06:32] <NoiseEee> otahak: well you can check for a specific id in the callback, but a class would ultimately be better
[15:12:02] <Dannyboy84> Hi folks
[15:12:07] <otahak> okay. so, see how #content contains #searchbar and how #searchbar contains #btn_search? when I target #searchbar, no luck - but when I target #content - it works. Why?
[15:13:05] <NoiseEee> there;s a little too much code there to try and wade through otahak - can you make a simpler version?  usually that will help you see the light.
[15:13:38] <otahak> good point. Will try that.
[15:14:07] <otahak> ouh! just realized something
[15:14:16] <otahak> I can target ( document ) and it still works!
[15:14:26] <otahak> will just target document henceforth, lol
[15:14:48] <otahak> any potential issues with that, NoiseEee?
[15:15:22] <NoiseEee> otahak: its being an expensive listener.  anytime anything on the document is going on, it has to look for that
[15:15:23] <NoiseEee> otahak: https://jsfiddle.net/twj4cjdk/1/
[15:16:38] <otahak> expensive as in memory?
[15:16:41] <NoiseEee> otahak: and don't 'click' buttons programatically, just call the handlers/callback
[15:16:46] <NoiseEee> otahak: it can slow things down.
[15:17:03] <otahak> what do you mean about "click" buttons programatically?
[15:17:03] <Dannyboy84> hey wondering if someone could modify a line of code that I got from stack overflow to click a button instead of bringing up an alert box
[15:17:14] <Dannyboy84> $("#sales-lister").on("click",".btn-info", function(){
[15:17:14] <Dannyboy84>   alert("success");
[15:17:14] <Dannyboy84> });
[15:17:18] <NoiseEee> otahak: as you can see by my paste, its clear that targetting #searchbar works fine.
[15:17:35] <NoiseEee> otahak: don't  $('#someButton').click()
[15:17:48] <otahak> oh! yeah, I will be using .on() henceforth
[15:18:02] <otahak> because I never make buttons that are intended for use once lol
[15:18:34] <otahak> and there must be a difference between the jsfiddle and my production site, then, because on the production site targeting searchbar does squat
[15:19:22] <NoiseEee> otahak: this is why people make reduced cases on fiddle
[15:19:25] <NoiseEee> good luck :)
[15:19:42] <otahak> haha. I understand. Im sure it's something I did.
[15:19:51] <otahak> and thanks again for all your help, NoiseEee
[15:20:07] <NoiseEee> np :)
[15:24:23] <otahak> Dannyboy84 - still need help?
[15:24:59] <otahak> what youre looking for is called confirm('question to be asked') and it's handled as boolean
[15:25:29] <otahak> so if (confirm('question')) {do some shit} else {do some other shit}
[15:25:46] <otahak> does that clear it up for ya?
[15:25:59] <Dannyboy84> yes please
[15:28:30] <Dannyboy84> I replaced alert("sucess"); with $('.btn-info')[0].click();
[15:28:35] <Dannyboy84> hoping the code would work
[15:29:08] <Dannyboy84> $('.btn-info')[0].click(); does work on another page, but this page that I am struggling with is using ajax
[15:30:28] <otahak> hmmm. sounds actually like maybe exactly what I came in here for
[15:30:40] <otahak> instead of using .click() - use .on() instead
[15:30:49] <otahak> Im assuming the button is loaded via ajax?
[15:30:52] <Dannyboy84> yes
[15:31:02] <Dannyboy84> the original code I showed for the alert popup does work
[15:31:13] <Dannyboy84> but I want the button to be pressed automatically when it appears
[15:31:16] <Dannyboy84> it appears randomly
[15:31:42] <otahak> could you jsfiddle it plz?
[15:31:47] <otahak> cant exactly imagine what youre talking about
[15:32:23] <Dannyboy84> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17715274/jquery-click-function-doesnt-work-after-ajax-call
[15:32:32] <Dannyboy84> otahak, thats where I got the code from, explains it better
[15:32:34] <Dannyboy84> than I could
[15:32:54] <Dannyboy84> the answer with the green tick is the code I am trying to modify
[15:33:08] <Dannyboy84> but instead of an alert box appearing, I want the button to be pressed
[15:33:14] <Dannyboy84> when it randomly appears
[15:33:24] <otahak> well, like I said earlier - you want to use a confirm() prompt
[15:33:52] <otahak> if (confirm('your prompt text')) {//do stuff} else {//do other stuff}
[15:37:35] <otahak> OH! NoiseEee - I just realized why it wasnt working with the immediate parent
[15:37:51] <NoiseEee> the parent wasnt there yet either?
[15:37:52] <otahak> #searchbar gets nixed and appended along with the button as well
[15:37:56] <otahak> ya
[15:38:01] <NoiseEee> ya #classic
[15:38:04] <otahak> haha
[15:38:06] <otahak> derp
[15:38:21] <otahak> but targeting the #wrap seems to work just fine
[15:38:41] <NoiseEee> but with this comes great knowledge of how to write efficient listeners, very few, and have their callbacks examine which element was clicked and fire off the appropriate method/function for the app logic
[15:38:58] <otahak> amen to that.
[15:39:10] <otahak> not sure I understand the last part of your ocmment tho
[15:39:16] <otahak> very few?
[15:39:39] <otahak> also, I thought that was more or less what I was doing here. OOP, not procedural.
[15:42:29] <NoiseEee> like, if you have a toolbar with 6 buttons that do different things, you'd write a single $(toolbar).on('click','button', $.proxy(function(el)  { //check what was clicked ..  if(something) { this.doSomething(el);} if(somethingElse) { this.doSomethingElse(el);}},this)) for example
[15:43:04] <otahak> ohhhhh
[15:43:21] <NoiseEee> otahak: for one thing, i'd take that "done" part of your xhr/ajax and put that into one function that gets called via the .done callback
[15:43:22] <otahak> so for each of those ifs you'd differentiate the buttons and their respective actions?
[15:43:49] <NoiseEee> otak: and referrering to defined methods/functions instead of just writing code write in the event handler/listener
[15:43:59] <NoiseEee> s/write in/right in
[15:44:49] <otahak> NoiseEee - is there a place I can learn these practices?
[15:45:13] <otahak> I understand the language - I just don't use it correctly lol
[15:49:39] <NoiseEee> hmmm
[15:49:54] <NoiseEee> getting a weekly email from jsweekly for sure
[15:50:06] <NoiseEee> they tend to post a lot of 'best practices' types of articles
[15:51:03] <otahak> nice
[15:51:15] <otahak> also, a friend just recommended a book I'll be picking up http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8
[15:51:32] <otahak> its geared to C++, but OOP transcends langs
[16:40:21] <bellez> hello. I have a quick question. I am trying to do a very large project. I have MULTIPLE input fields that have calculations going on behind the scenes. each is tied to an input event. However I need to get the complete sum of all of the inputs. is there a simple way of doing so?
[16:41:38] <NoiseEee> doing what
[16:41:43] <NoiseEee> getting all the inputs?
[16:43:13] <bellez> say I have 3 different inputs that have different numbers. behind the scenes there are calculations that are happening. I need the get results of the calculations behind the scenes and add them together
[16:45:21] <bellez> i'm still new to programming. I apologize if it seems like a silly question
[16:47:12] <NoiseEee> well, you would grab the values of the inputs and do the math on them
[16:47:23] <NoiseEee> then present that result to the screen
[16:47:57] <NoiseEee> so anytime an input field changes, use a jquery selector to grab all the inputs you care about, get their values, pass them to your 'calculate' function
[16:48:19] <bellez> i have the calculations done and i can print them to the console if I call it inside the event. However the result of the calculations in the back isn't being sent to the screen... it needs to be added up and subtracted from a total
[16:48:39] <bellez> calculation is done differently for each input :(
[16:48:57] <NoiseEee> i don't understand "However the result of the calculations in the back isn't being sent to the screen."
[16:49:08] <NoiseEee> you mean a backend?
[16:49:18] <bellez> yes..
[16:49:57] <NoiseEee> so that would be ajax/xhr
[16:50:10] <NoiseEee> when an input changes, fire the xhr to get the backend value. when its returned, do your calcs
[16:50:52] <bellez> all the calculations are done already using the jquery. I just need the result of all the calculations (which will not be seen by the user) to be added together
[16:53:09] <NoiseEee> ok
[16:53:11] <NoiseEee> what does that?
[16:53:17] <NoiseEee> the backend?
[16:53:35] <NoiseEee> im not sure what you're stuck on
[16:53:42] <bellez> holdon
[16:55:23] <bellez> here is an example of one of the input  that I have...
[16:55:24] <bellez> http://kopy.io/A7rFI
[16:55:59] <bellez> I need to get the value of resBP and add that to many others like it and store it in a variable like total.
[16:56:34] <ABM_Dan> is there a quick way for me to join the attributes of a simple object as if it was an array? (I don't care about the key).
[16:58:27] <NoiseEee> bellez: loosely like this http://kopy.io/NIUlx
[16:59:01] <NoiseEee> 'join the attributes' meaning
[16:59:21] <bellez> ok thank you NoiseEee
[16:59:39] <NoiseEee> np bellez good luck
[17:05:52] <Felishia> little help here I wrote a bunch of ajax request
[17:06:07] <Felishia> now I've moved them crossdomain and I've allowed credentials in the response headers
[17:06:18] <Felishia> xhrFields: {withCredentials: true}
[17:06:50] <Felishia> I need to set that for every request but that'd be a pain to do... I heard, but I'm getting a bit confused, that I can modify the defaults of every ajax request to take that as default, how would I do that?
[17:08:17] <NoiseEee> Felishia: https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/ and https://api.jquery.com/ajaxSend/
[17:09:01] <Felishia> NoiseEee, I can modify the settings in the ajaxSend?
[17:09:46] <NoiseEee> I'd presume so - peek at parameters 2 and 3
[17:12:08] <Felishia> >:c eh that answer was wrong
[17:12:18] <Felishia> nevermind I discovered how it's done :3
[17:12:25] <Felishia> now I don't have to rewrite all the code
[17:12:31] <NoiseEee> beauty
[17:12:33] <NoiseEee> how was it done?
[17:16:02] <Felishia> NoiseEee, $.ajaxSetup({xhrFields: {withCredentials: true}});
[17:16:10] <Felishia> now everything is working
[17:16:15] <Felishia> now I have to do it low level :p
[17:16:46] <Drewery> I have a $.get call and I want to capture the function(returnData) { returnData } part and export it into a variable
[17:16:51] <Drewery> how can I do that ?
[17:17:28] <Drewery> I define the variable outside the $.get and try to assign the returnData but it translates to undefined
[17:20:59] <Felishia> Drewery, define that better
[17:20:59] <Felishia> you're trying to do .bind?
[17:27:06] <Drewery> Felishia: I am trying to do : var myVar; $.get('xxxxx', function(returnData) { myVar = returnData; } console.log(myVar); returns undefined
[17:27:20] <Drewery> but if I console.log within the $.get function it returns the object
[17:27:34] <Drewery> I am trying to capture that object and dump it into a variable for later use
[17:59:59] <z1haze> hi, how would I go about adding links to a boostrap navigation dynamically? I have a few buttons below my navigation (not in the main nav bar) that I want to push into the mobile nav when the page changes to use the mobile nav
[18:02:38] <david_bajer> Hi there, I have a small problem with the JQM. I open the left panel, click on a link inside the panel -> redirect me on a different site and there, if I open again the left panel and try to close panel via close button, it redirect me back to homepage instead of closing that panel (but the swipe close works and click on "main content" also works, just the close button don't). Can someone help me with that? Thanks a lot.
[18:02:57] <david_bajer> *redirects
[18:32:44] <z1haze> $( window ).width() shows the viewable area of the user right?
[18:47:23] <z1haze> $(this).children('span').attr('class') am i close? i want to grab the class of the span inside if this
[19:06:07] <otahak> hey folks. how does one prevent the double binding of an event?
[19:06:18] <otahak> $( '#btn_del' ).unbind('click').off(); doesnt seem to do what I need.
[19:07:45] <otahak> I have this button that gets generated via ajax, and I want to unbind before initialization just to ensure the pursuant pop up doesnt show up twice
[19:45:44] <bellez> is there any way to take a value found INSIDE a jquery event and use it elsewhere outside that event?
[19:50:15] <bellez> i have a value inside a jquery event (i.e. an on('input') event) I want to take the value X and use it in a different equation.
[19:50:33] <bellez> or even put it into an array so I can cycle through it.
[19:56:26] <bellez> is anyone there that can help?
[19:56:32] <shoky> bellez: you can do all those stuff, but they'll only see the new value if they do stuff _after_ the event has fired. meaning you should do those stuff, from inside the event handler, because that's exactly the code that runs after the event fires
[19:57:18] <shoky> bellez: but still if you change some value from inside the event handler, anything outside it can see that value, if run after the event handler has fired
[19:57:49] <bellez> shoky: what is happening is as I increase a number in the input, it does a calculation in the background. I need to take that final calculation. However when i call that variable outside of the event handler, it says NaN or undefined...
[19:58:22] <shoky> bellez: then you're calling that variable _before_ the event has even happened.
[19:58:27] <shoky> (probably)]
[19:58:48] <bellez> how would I call it after? (still new to the language)
[19:58:49] <shoky> bellez: code that you place after the event handler  does not run after the code inside. don't let that confuse you
[19:58:58] <shoky> bellez: you'd call it from inside.
[19:59:10] <shoky> get used to this :)
[19:59:21] <bellez> but I need it OUTSIDE the event
[19:59:26] <shoky> why?
[19:59:43] <shoky> anyway make a jsfiddle showing your issue
[19:59:45] <bellez> because I take the calculation of many different input fields (all with different calculations) and add them together
[19:59:51] <shoky> and i'll show you how to fix it
[20:00:16] <shoky> so then you need to run your calculation only after the last input event
[20:01:06] <shoky> but it will _have_ to be in some event handler
[20:05:53] <bellez> https://jsfiddle.net/cLov3p4u/
[20:06:49] <bellez> that is just one of the calculations basically I have about 30 of these that I need to total up and see what the total is to compare it against something else.
[20:09:47] <bellez> do you see anything shoky? I need to go soon dinner is ready...
[20:12:50] <bellez> i'll be back I need to get dinner
[20:20:55] <shoky> bellez: line 12 runs BEFORE lines 5-6 , that's why it's undefined
[20:21:30] <shoky> bellez: putting code after the event handler doesn't make it run after the event.. it'll run on page load (because it's in a $(document).ready block)
[20:21:52] <shoky> bellez: why not move line 12 inside the event handler?
[20:23:13] <shoky> bellez: also.. it's not too helpful if you don't show the actual scenario you're having an issue with.. put at least another input so it simulates your scenario more
[20:23:30] <shoky> and make a working fiddle
[20:26:16] <shoky> bellez: and if you need to really wait before each of the text fields has an input event, then you need a counter or some other way to track which/how many inputs have already fired, and on each input event check that counter/flag and update it
[20:26:35] <shoky> ..and they're gone
[20:29:23] <m625> Hey guys, I have an ajax call that loads upon success of a an ajax form submit. It runs fine on my test server, but on the clients server it loads a completely differn't pages content into the areas I want reloaded. Anyone ever experience this?
[20:29:51] <m625> I actually have no idea how it's even getting this other url
[20:30:01] <m625> though I'm assuming it's some wordpress redirect maybe
[20:30:39] <m625> is there anyway I can follow what's happening with the call in chrome? never really had any issues with somethign this simple.
[20:30:58] <m625> could cloudflare be an issue ? they use it.
[20:31:56] <shoky> m625 you can check the devtools network tab in chrome and see the request/response headers and body, status, etc
[20:32:12] <shoky> doesn't sound like a jquery issue tho ;p
[20:36:39] <m625> ya I know
[20:36:46] <m625> hate this type of stuff :(
[20:37:13] <m625> cause it usually means I don't get paid until their sysadmin fixes whatever setting causes it.
[20:38:25] <m625> was hoping maybe someone has seen it before
[20:43:44] <bellez> are you there still shoky?
[20:44:11] <m625> shoky, it also finishes the ajax call by tacking on the whole post request to the url in the bar
[20:44:12] <m625> wtf
[20:46:10] <bellez> i need to be able to call the variable OUTSIDE the event handler... not just in it...
[20:53:36] <m625> shoky ya the script is requesting the wrong url how odd
[20:54:24] <m625> is there any way in chrome to see what or why it was called?
[20:54:36] <m625> I have 0 links to that page anywhere on either file
[20:54:40] <m625> so odd
[21:09:28] <shoky> bellez: i'm here for a bit.. but you're not listening :)  if you want something to happen after an event (or events) happen, it'll have to be inside an event handler.  and you didn't update your fiddle
[21:10:06] <bellez> i have someone helping right now I thinkI understand a bit but still don't understand a lot
[21:10:39] <shoky> bellez: ok. you also didn't really fully explain what behaviour you want
[21:11:24] <bellez> i've tried in the best way I know how which obviously isn't good enough :( I'm about to just give up... I've been working on this all day and its the only thing standing between me and my son having a decent christmas
[21:11:36] <bellez> sorry if I sound a bit upset :(
[21:11:40] <shoky> a working fiddle showing your actual problem is the best way
[21:11:52] <shoky> it's alright :)
[21:13:12] <shoky> bellez: if you want to walk me through it now, i'm listening
[21:13:19] <bellez> i have 30+ input fields that have calculations behind the scenes each with their own event handler.... i need to take ALL of those calculations and add the results together... but I can't do that because none of the dang results will go beyond the event handler
[21:13:34] <shoky> nono see
[21:14:04] <shoky> "i have 30+ input fields that have calculations behind the scenes"   can you be more vague? :)
[21:14:22] <bellez> i cant go into a lot of detail because of my contract...
[21:15:06] <bellez> that's why I said i'll just give up even the idiot working with me who has 30 yrs experience in the field doesn't know how to do it so i'm screwed
[21:15:30] <shoky> for each of those 30+ calculations that you do for each field - when does this calculation happen?
[21:15:36] <shoky> on 'change' event of that input ?
[21:15:40] <jquery704> is there a certification for jquery?
[21:16:11] <bellez> it needs to happen as soon as the user increases or decreases the number in the input box
[21:16:34] <shoky> jquery704: don't think so. (definitely don't go for anything from w3schools if you see something)
[21:16:57] <bellez> according to the prove-it test this one agency sent me i'm profiecent in the language but i'm obviously not :(
[21:18:07] <shoky> bellez: and when the page first loads and user sees the input fields but hasn't done anything yet,  no calculation takes place yet here on page load?  like, with an initial/default value for each input or something
[21:18:53] <bellez> there is a default value of 0 in each field
[21:19:17] <bellez> so the default calculation for each is 0
[21:19:19] <shoky> and does a calculation take place with that value?
[21:19:31] <shoky> ok so:  <bellez> it needs to happen as soon as the user increases or decreases the number in the input box
[21:19:37] <shoky> is incorrect :)
[21:19:48] <shoky> it needs to happen on page load, you're saying now.
[21:19:55] <bellez> no....
[21:19:58] <bellez> forget it...
[21:20:17] <shoky> you just mentioned a "default calculation"
[21:20:24] <shoky> after i was asking about default value on page load
[21:20:34] <shoky> obviously i would think you mean  this default calculation happens on page load
[21:20:38] <shoky> why "forget it"?
[21:20:58] <jquery704> @shoky what was the problem>
[21:20:58] <bellez> because i'm about to just give up....
[21:20:59] <jquery704> ?
[21:21:03] <shoky> if you just answer the questions we'll fix your shit..
[21:21:14] <bellez> because i'm getting frustrated...
[21:21:28] <shoky> so?
[21:21:32] <bellez> i don't know how to explain what i need and when I think i know how to i screw it up more :(
[21:21:44] <shoky> i am trying to help you by asking questions
[21:21:49] <shoky> and trying to get precise answers
[21:21:53] <bellez> and i'm answering them wrong:(
[21:21:56] <jquery704> modularize the problem!
[21:21:56] <shoky> we were making progress. then you stopped :(
[21:22:10] <shoky> jquery704: the problem is currently trying to understand the problem :)
[21:22:18] <shoky> plz2modularize
[21:22:19] <bellez> ok... when the page loads ALL the values have a 0 in them
[21:22:42] <shoky> ok. and does any calculation take place (on page load) with this default 0 value?
[21:22:55] <shoky> befor the user touched any input field
[21:23:06] <bellez> it only takes place when the user increases/decreases the value
[21:23:14] <bellez> which can only be increased after the page loads
[21:23:24] <shoky> ok cool.
[21:23:52] <shoky> and another question - when do you want to do the summing up of those 30+ calculations ?
[21:24:07] <shoky> when should this happen, and what should happen with the result?
[21:24:34] <bellez> i need it to happen almost at the same time. there is a "limit" as to how many "points" a user can use (the points are the calculation results that occur.)
[21:24:42] <shoky> "almost at the same time" ?
[21:24:45] <shoky> as what?
[21:24:55] <bellez> The user is to be able to see how many "Points" they have used and how many are left
[21:25:44] <bellez> so say they increase one input by 2 and it takes 5 points away, they should be able to see something that says "you've used 5 points you have X left"
[21:27:38] <shoky> so every time the user changes an input,  all of them should be summed and that message should be displayed,  yes?
[21:27:47] <bellez> yes.
[21:28:35] <shoky> ok. will it help if i make a small demo of that, not related to your fiddle?  or do you need to me to do it with the code you gave me?
[21:28:59] <bellez> if you can show me an example I can fit it to my code
[21:29:04] <shoky> oks
[21:29:09] <bellez> thank you
[21:29:33] <shoky> np
[21:29:35] <bellez> and once again apologize for getting emotional... if i don't get this done, my son doesn't have a christmas:(
[21:29:40] <shoky> the inputs are  type="number"?
[21:29:47] <bellez> yes
[21:30:19] <shoky> ah yea i see in your fiddle. chrome only shows the spinner when i hover/focus the input :@
[21:44:30] <shoky> bellez: well.. lemme know if this helps. if not we can improve it  https://jsfiddle.net/f40t8xvn/1/
[21:45:48] <shoky> bellez: uhh removed that messing with .map  https://jsfiddle.net/f40t8xvn/2/
[21:46:29] <shoky> turned out pretty simple..
[21:47:03] <bellez> yeah one sec... talking to someone at home...
[21:49:34] <bellez> shoky. I think that will work. I'll stay in chat and let you know once I implement it into mine :) Thank you
[21:50:37] <shoky> yer welcome. i'm going to sleep in a bit, back tomorrow, hopefully others will help too if you need it. merry christmas to you and kiddo :)
[21:52:02] <bellez> thanks! :)
