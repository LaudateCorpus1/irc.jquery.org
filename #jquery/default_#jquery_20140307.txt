[00:00:59] <Cork> jop008: well you could start by digging into what goes wrong
[00:01:49] <jop008> but how browser quits
[00:01:56] <jop008> so how to debug
[00:02:14] <Cork> you mean the browser crashes?
[00:02:19] <jop008> yes
[00:02:31] <jop008> mobile safari quits
[00:03:00] <Cork> out of my league then
[00:03:12] <Cork> jop008: if it quits you would have to find what quits it
[00:03:28] <Cork> if it crashes you should look for a bug report of what makes it crash
[00:03:44] <jop008> Yes seems reasonable but problem is how
[00:03:54] <MartinSebastian7> can any one tell me what to use for setting columns using query or css.  I used to always use jquery ui and blueprint, but I am seeing a different trend and will try bootstrap next
[00:04:00] <jop008> Bug report on mobile sql?
[00:04:09] <jop008> safari
[00:06:47] <jop008> how to get a mobile safari bug report?
[00:15:57] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/69uWh/5/ if someone makes this work on mobile devices as well I can spend some bugs on that. In mobile safari it stops after choosing one country trying to fill in a second one crashes the browser
[00:32:32] <MartinSebastian7> whats better jQuery UI or Bootstrap??? Please
[00:32:54] <lolmaus> MartinSebastian7: those do completely different things and can't be compared.
[00:33:23] <lolmaus> MartinSebastian7: it's like comparing a bicycle to an bowl of soup.
[00:33:50] <MartinSebastian7> well I used to always use jQuery UI along with Blueprint,
[00:34:08] <MartinSebastian7> But now it looks like I can do so much with just Bootstrap
[00:34:11] <systemfault> MartinSebastian7: What if... I told you that you can find a bootstrap theme for jQuery-UI
[00:34:20] <fabioportieri> doesn't bootstrap comes with a set of js enabled components? if so i don't think there is much of a difference between the two
[00:34:38] <systemfault> There's a world of difference between the two.
[00:34:48] <systemfault> boostrap is mainly CSS with a little bit of JS
[00:34:59] <systemfault> JQuery-UI is a shitload of JS + CSS
[00:35:10] <MartinSebastian7> I guess you are right.
[00:35:55] <MartinSebastian7> so bootstrap is mostly CSS but also utilizes jQuery right?
[00:36:31] <fabioportieri> yes
[00:36:37] <systemfault> Yeah
[00:36:42] <MartinSebastian7> I see so boot strap is way more like a theme??
[00:37:32] <systemfault> It's advertised as a CSS framework.
[00:37:33] <MartinSebastian7> and query UI is the java framework with CSS when you get to styling.
[00:37:49] <MartinSebastian7> for some reason I thought I had to choose between theml
[00:39:40] <MartinSebastian7> I am just getting back to using irc in a very long time. on mac,  what clients do you guys prefer??
[00:39:53] <systemfault> No, you can even use them together
[00:40:23] <systemfault> MartinSebastian7: I'm still on colloquy(Really shitty) but I will probably move to limechat soon
[00:40:24] <MartinSebastian7> I guess I grabbed the first thing I saw which was Textual
[00:40:40] <fabioportieri> webchat works for me
[00:41:04] <jop008> Cork can you tell me to debug code on iPad?
[00:41:24] <jop008> I tested my fiddle in simulator as well but also a faillure
[00:41:51] <jop008> Can people without apple and without an iPad debug this as well?
[00:42:33] <MartinSebastian7> I like the web client as well but I am just getting to a point where I have way too many browser windows.  Its nice to have a native app running
[00:54:51] <tobago> One of my pages (Extended form with multiple dialog boxes and stuff) has to have work offline. What should be my choice for dealing with offline?
[00:57:03] <fabioportieri> what?
[00:57:24] <fabioportieri> how can a website work offline??
[00:57:51] <Macaveli> Cork inline-block did the trick
[00:58:13] <tobago> fabioportieri, the workflow is: the user is online, gets all his data, is offline,user processes some stuff, is offline again and pushes the data to the server.
[00:58:33] <tobago> ... is online again...
[00:58:42] <tobago> and pushes the data to the server.
[00:59:07] <jop008> I tried to debug this with safari developement tools but not easy since it quits suddenly and could not step over the code http://jsfiddle.net/69uWh/5/
[00:59:21] <jop008> Any cracker jack avail with an iPad?
[00:59:22] <tobago> it means the user is offline for some time, but has to be able to process his stuff anyway.
[01:25:19] <hxm> hi, if I have this json format https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/users/lookup  and I can loop trough the keys & values using this jQuery.each(userList, function(key, value) { jQuery.each(value, function(key, value) { does not exist a easier way for get the image? in example userList.image_profile_url or something like that?
[01:26:49] <Cork> hxm: jQuery.each(userList, function(key, value) { value.profile_image_url }) should work
[01:27:03] <hxm> ah, thank you
[01:27:08] <Cork> and if you ever only have one user you can remove the loop
[01:27:18] <Cork> userList[0].profile_image_url
[01:27:24] <hxm> aha, right
[01:39:51] <DarsVaeda> how do I disable a button and leave events intact?
[01:40:21] <systemfault> myButton.prop('disabled', true)?
[01:40:40] <Cork> depends if you mean that event should still fire
[01:41:12] <DarsVaeda> yes I want to set disabled to false on mouseleave but the event is not fired anymore if the button is disabled
[01:41:27] <Cork> you can't use disabled
[01:41:44] <Cork> you would have to style the button width css to do that
[01:42:14] <DarsVaeda> hmm that is not what I intend
[01:42:22] <DarsVaeda> can I disable the click event handler only?
[01:42:26] <Cork> no
[01:42:36] <DarsVaeda> which is what I want, I want that it can't be clicked anymore
[01:42:45] <Cork> you can set a variable and then check that variable in the click event handler
[01:43:14] <DarsVaeda> meh
[01:43:50] <krizoek> hi. how do i get the reponsetext? this doesnt seem to work: var newData = $.get('vars.php'); alert( newData.responsetext)
[01:44:19] <Cork> krizoek: you use the callback from $.get
[01:44:32] <krizoek> how do you mean?
[01:44:36] <Cork> $.get(url, function(data) { alert(data); })
[01:44:58] <krizoek> it seems when i do so, the variable is stored inside there only
[01:45:00] <Cork> or $.get(url).done(function(data) { alert(data); }) if you prefer that
[01:45:05] <Cork> ya
[01:45:10] <Cork> krizoek: ajax is async
[01:45:12] <systemfault> krizoek: Welcome to async hell :)
[01:45:15] <Cork> you can't get the data before it exists
[01:45:37] <krizoek> it seems that the responsetext exists inside the newData variable
[01:45:43] <krizoek> but how do i get it out?
[01:45:50] <Cork> no it exists after done has fired
[01:45:59] <Cork> you have to wait for the response to get back
[01:46:17] <Cork> and you have two options using the done/complete callback
[01:46:33] <Cork> or using a timer and hoping it has come back when it fires (NOT recommended)
[01:46:53] <krizoek> how do i get the variable out of that function after?
[01:47:10] <Cork> krizoek: the problem isn't getting it out
[01:47:21] <systemfault> krizoek: You need to change your mind.... you need to change the flow of your program.
[01:47:22] <Cork> it is that you think that the code after runs after the function you give to get
[01:47:46] <systemfault> krizoek: What would usually be after the $.get should be inside the callback
[01:48:20] <Cork> krizoek: alert('order1'); $.get().done(function() { alert('order3 }); alert('order2');
[01:48:29] <Cork> the output order will be 1,2,3
[01:48:31] <Cork> not 1,3,2
[01:48:47] <Cork> so the code after the get call will run BEFORE the code inside the callback
[01:49:13] <Cork> krizoek: also returning the data you get from ajax isn't possible
[01:49:14] <krizoek> this work yes. ty :)
[01:49:45] <krizoek> or, only the alert worked
[01:50:02] <krizoek> whats the point if you cant get the data?
[01:50:46] <Cork> krizoek: you do get the data
[01:51:09] <Cork> krizoek: but async means the code flow isn't stopped while you wait for the data to come over the network
[01:51:24] <Cork> krizoek: the browser calls the function you give to $.get when the data comes in
[01:51:25] <krizoek> ahh
[01:51:31] <Cork> meaning it happens out of code order
[01:51:37] <Cork> == async
[01:55:13] <Macaveli> Did anyone ever use Kalendae?
[02:02:17] <cp1025> hey can someone give me idea how i can use jquery to listen for keypress? but i want to do it for the page, not a form item
[02:03:10] <Cork> $(document).keydown(function() {})
[02:13:21] <cp1025> Cork - thanks, can i call a php file from that?
[02:13:46] <Cork> cp1025: you would have to use $.get/$.post or $.ajax
[02:16:57] <jop008> when I use this it is real slow http://192.168.1.47:8080/rental/NList/index.html when I replace it with localhost it is normal behaviour
[02:17:14] <jop008> and 1.47 is local ip address
[02:17:16] <becom33> hello . I've been a problem with this websql select query and I was hoping if any of you would be able to help me if I this code http://pastebin.com/GqDU2cz2 as "cc = foo.local_get_member_name(db,11,function(result){return result},function(){})"
[02:17:42] <systemfault> Isn't websql... like... dead?
[02:17:50] <becom33> I dont get the result :/
[02:18:02] <becom33> systemfault: its for a mobile application
[02:18:09] <systemfault> Still dead though :/
[02:18:22] <becom33> he he systemfault what do you recommend ?
[02:19:16] <cp1025> ok thanks Cork
[02:20:50] <systemfault> becom33: I don't know.. perhaps you could use local/session storage :(
[02:21:20] <becom33> systemfault: I tried it and it doesnt work for my project scope
[02:21:50] <becom33> systemfault: could you check my code and tell me why isnt this working
[02:22:17] <systemfault> I never bothered to learn it... because it's a dead tech
[02:22:19] <systemfault> :/
[02:22:22] <systemfault> Sorry...
[02:23:24] <becom33> well Im not sure if its a problem with sql . the problem is I'm not getting return value eventho I was able to console.log out the result
[02:24:24] <systemfault> Ahhhh
[02:24:50] <systemfault> Then you simply have a understanding issue with async
[02:25:15] <systemfault> As soon as you get into async callbacks, "return"s become useless
[02:25:16] <becom33> hmm I see
[02:25:31] <becom33> so what can I do here
[02:25:59] <systemfault> local_get_member_name should have a callback parameter that is called on success/failure
[02:26:17] <systemfault> and then, once it succeeds/fails, you call the proper callback
[02:26:42] <becom33> systemfault: it has .
[02:27:37] <systemfault> Then you're not using the function properly.
[02:28:16] <systemfault> http://pastebin.com/BZhYYEQ7
[02:28:22] <systemfault> That's how it should be
[02:29:26] <systemfault> Then myObject.local_get_member_name(myId, theId, function(data) { doSomethingWithData(data); }, function(error) { console.log('OMG it failed ' + error.message); })
[02:33:05] <jop008> running 1.3.2 version of jquery mobile with 1.9.1 I got this error Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'autocomplete'
[02:33:14] <jop008> is this because of the old version?
[02:35:40] <Cork> jop008: i think mobile depends on jquery ui
[02:36:22] <Cork> jop008: but yes 1.3 is very old you should try to update that
[02:40:47] <shoky> don't think mobile depends on ui
[02:49:56] <cp1025> hey all, Cork, is there much wrong with this
[02:49:57] <cp1025> http://pastebin.com/hMBEax0d

[02:50:38] <Cork> (var=

[02:50:53] <Cork> should work apart from that
[02:51:51] <cp1025> oh
[02:51:54] <cp1025> ok thanks
[02:52:23] <Bogdaniel> hello can someone help me with this code http://jsfiddle.net/Y4A6r/ i'm trying to concat data inside the fill function and i can't get it wrapped in '' when it outputs the html
[02:52:23] <Kingsy> if you render a <img> but it is display:none do you need to preload it? or will the browser load the image?
[02:53:50] <Cork> Bogdaniel: get what wrapped?
[02:54:22] <Cork> Kingsy: the image will be fetched when the image hits the dom
[02:54:57] <Cork> Bogdaniel: also please don't add event attributes
[02:55:01] <Cork> use event handlers instead
[02:55:14] <Bogdaniel> Cork: hi there, if you look over the code where i generate the li you will see the onclick part where i want to add fill('+value+')
[02:55:25] <Bogdaniel> and that's the place where i can't concat it right
[02:55:42] <Bogdaniel> Cork: what should i use ?
[02:56:45] <Cork> Bogdaniel: http://jsfiddle.net/Y4A6r/1/
[02:57:11] <Kingsy> Cork: sorry what do you mean? after you display:block the image will it be downloaded to the browser at the point? or when the html is rendered?
[02:57:38] <Cork> Kingsy: by "hit" i meant when you add the element to the document dom
[02:57:50] <Cork> visible or not it will download the image
[02:57:52] <cool_boy> Hello there! I want to show length of the text in password field. here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/AXCXR/. I am not able to display it. could someone please help me?
[02:57:56] <Cork> it won't render it though
[02:57:58] <Kingsy> ah good good, I assumed as much
[02:58:01] <Cork> so you will still get a delay there
[02:58:14] <Cork> well most modern browsers won't render it rather
[02:58:14] <cool_boy> *length of text beside password field
[02:58:17] <Kingsy> yeah, as long as displaying the image will be seemless because the user has already downloaded it
[02:58:36] <Cork> Kingsy: depends on the size of the image
[02:58:42] <Cork> and the speed of the computer
[02:58:47] <Kingsy> yeah
[02:58:49] <Cork> as decoding an image can take a little time
[02:58:50] <carousel> i want to use the jcarousel plugin, but the examples for a vertical carousel are no longer available on the main page. does anyone have a working example for a vertical jcarousel?
[02:59:11] <Kingsy> thanks
[03:03:08] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong?! http://jsfiddle.net/jq7p4/
[03:03:36] <cp1025> lol sorry Cork, http://pastebin.com/DXy5Kz6g as you of already guessed im a noob! :D
[03:03:42] <cp1025> can you see what ive done
[03:05:31] <Cork> cp1025: works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/4U9bw/
[03:06:10] <cp1025> cork how do you test it there?
[03:06:16] <cp1025> its not live?
[03:06:19] <Cork> yes
[03:06:30] <Cork> just focus the right bottom window
[03:06:33] <Cork> and test it
[03:07:20] <krambiorix> Cork , any idea?
[03:08:32] <Cork> krambiorix: 31 > 12
[03:08:44] <Cork> you don't allow the first value to be bigger then 12
[03:09:48] <cp1025> Cork, what options do i need to check on jsfiddle on the left?
[03:09:51] <cp1025> it doesnt work for me
[03:10:02] <Cork> what browser?
[03:10:06] <cp1025> chrome
[03:10:14] <Cork> and you don't need to check any options
[03:10:45] <jop008> anyone a good editor with good auto formatter? and coloumn mode?
[03:10:48] <Cork> cp1025: works fine here in chrome
[03:10:49] <cp1025> hmm
[03:10:57] <cp1025> what? u press 0 or 1
[03:10:59] <Cork> cp1025: what keys do you expect 48 and 49 to be?
[03:11:01] <Cork> yes
[03:11:10] <cp1025> lol wtf
[03:11:16] <Bogdaniel> Cork: thank you very much it works  :-)
[03:11:16] <Cork> your on mac btw?
[03:11:25] <Cork> Bogdaniel: np
[03:11:26] <cp1025> well, im on windows, but on a mc
[03:11:27] <cp1025> :P
[03:11:35] <cp1025> mac
[03:11:51] <Cork> cp1025: ok, i know mac has a messed up keyboard focus schema
[03:11:59] <Cork> so if you where on that it could explain things
[03:12:09] <cp1025> oh
[03:12:15] <cp1025> but mac on windows should be ok
[03:12:16] <cp1025> ?
[03:12:35] <Cork> ya
[03:12:40] <Cork> it isn't about hardware
[03:12:43] <cp1025> oh crap
[03:12:47] <cp1025> lol
[03:12:50] <cp1025> im an idiot :D
[03:12:56] <cp1025> differnt keycode for numlock
[03:12:57] <cp1025> :P
[03:13:03] <krambiorix> Cork ... http://jsfiddle.net/jq7p4/1/
[03:13:18] <Cork> heh
[03:13:25] <cp1025> lol thanks cork :P
[03:13:37] <Cork> cp1025: i used the number atop of the normal keyboard :)
[03:13:49] <cp1025> haaha why didnt i think of that
[03:14:12] <cp1025> they are 96 + 97 instead :D
[03:14:15] <Cork> krambiorix: now you allow 13
[03:14:36] <Cork> krambiorix: the regex allows mm/dd/yyyy not dd/mm/yyyy
[03:15:24] <cp1025> well, cork, thanks alot man, really enjoying learning this :D its powerful, in browser! but thanks for help
[03:15:33] <Cork> np
[03:16:00] <krambiorix> hmmm
[03:16:02] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/jq7p4/2/
[03:16:38] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks a lot ( i hate but need regex and i'm not good in it)
[03:16:52] <Cork> krambiorix: regex isn't that hard
[03:17:59] <krambiorix> Cork, i just don't get it
[03:18:26] <Cork> krambiorix: http://www.regular-expressions.info/
[03:18:35] <Cork> it explains quite well how regex works
[03:19:06] <krambiorix> Cork, ok thanks, i'll give it a try
[03:20:26] <Cork> krambiorix: and the regex you have is quite simple
[03:22:17] <Cork> the string has to start with(^)
[03:22:23] <Cork> 01 - 09((0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]))
[03:22:45] <Cork> or 10 - 29((0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]))
[03:23:05] <Cork> or 30 or 31 ((0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]))
[03:23:25] <Cork> followed by a / or a - (([\/-]))
[03:24:17] <Cork> (0[1-9]([\/-])|1[012]) looks a bit weird though
[03:24:24] <Cork> i don't think that one is intentional
[03:24:57] <krambiorix> so the 1[012] means minimum 1 and max 12?
[03:25:33] <BinaryKitten> no
[03:25:45] <BinaryKitten> that means 10 max 12
[03:25:54] <BinaryKitten> since it's [ ] not { }
[03:26:21] <BinaryKitten> [ ] = Character in this set
[03:26:35] <BinaryKitten> 1 followed by a 0, 1 or a 2
[03:26:52] <krambiorix> but the month should be between 1 - 12
[03:26:57] <BinaryKitten> right
[03:27:34] <BinaryKitten> so
[03:27:45] <Cork> krambiorix: it means a 1 followed by 0, 1 or 2
[03:27:54] <Cork> so 10 to 12
[03:28:08] <BinaryKitten> [1-9]|(1[0,1,2])
[03:28:18] <Cork> uh
[03:28:28] <Cork> that doesn't look right
[03:28:40] <BinaryKitten> 1-9 OR 10,11,12
[03:28:52] <Cork> you didn't write that
[03:29:05] <BinaryKitten> no?
[03:29:18] <Cork> (0[1-9]|1[012])
[03:29:35] <Cork> at least if you want to have it in a regex compound
[03:29:42] <Cork> cause you didn't wrapp the |
[03:29:45] <Cork> with ()
[03:29:55] <Cork> also no comma in []
[03:30:39] <BinaryKitten> yep the comma was for english reading syntax
[03:30:42] <BinaryKitten> not actual matching
[03:30:42] <jop008> I have this on my page http://pastebin.com/Pp23rLVa but I want to have it 3 times for each separte field like places_nearby places_to_eat
[03:30:51] <jop008> how to arrange this cleverly?
[03:31:09] <krambiorix> Well anyway thanks a lot Cork, BinaryKitten !!
[03:31:25] <Cork> jop008: more paragraphs and less br...
[03:31:40] <BinaryKitten> Cork the | doesn't match the group does it?
[03:31:57] <Cork> krambiorix: it separates alternative in the group yes
[03:34:10] <cool_boy> Is there any way to check error in jquery if code is not working ?? what is wrong in if else block here http://jsfiddle.net/AXCXR/2/??
[03:34:20] <Cork> krambiorix: /([012][1-9]|3[01])[-/](0[1-9]|1[012])[-/]2(\d{3}))/
[03:34:43] <jop008> Cork what do you mean?
[03:34:44] <Cork> krambiorix: that should validate dd/mm/2YYY
[03:35:06] <Cork> jop008: <br><br><br> normally mean you should have a <p> there instead
[03:35:11] <BinaryKitten> i so wish there was a date.fromString('format', dateValue)
[03:35:31] <Cork> BinaryKitten: ther are libs that provide that
[03:35:54] <BinaryKitten> yeah but nothing core
[03:36:00] <Cork> true
[03:36:03] <jop008> Okay that I can fix easily but what to do for 3 types of fields like that duplicate in the html?
[03:36:04] <Cork> date handling in core sucks
[03:36:07] <Cork> through and through
[03:36:16] <BinaryKitten> date.parse isn't even fully supported yet
[03:36:21] <jop008> The html is coupled to javascript
[03:36:25] <Cork> duplicate?
[03:36:42] <jop008> In js field field_id and result_count is used
[03:36:44] <Cork> you mean you append fields later or something?
[03:37:08] <krambiorix> Cork, but i don't see the difference between : /^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])([\/])(0[1-9]|1[012])\2(\d{4})$/;  and your last regex /([012][1-9]|3[01])[-/](0[1-9]|1[012])[-/]2(\d{3}))/
[03:37:38] <cool_boy> why I am being ignored? Is my english not parsable??
[03:37:49] <Cork> krambiorix: well to start of with the earlier one expects 5 digits in the year
[03:38:13] <Cork> cool_boy: just wait, someone will answer when they have time
[03:38:32] <krambiorix> Cork, \d{4}  --> ?
[03:38:40] <cool_boy> Cork: thanks
[03:38:40] <Cork> \d == digits
[03:38:50] <Cork> {4} <-- 4 digits
[03:38:57] <Cork> but you have a 2 infront of it
[03:39:08] <Cork> so 2 + \d[4] = 5 digits starting with a 2
[03:40:41] <krambiorix> ow
[03:41:11] <krambiorix> Cork, but 13/03/2014 validates with my regex
[03:41:23] <krambiorix> )\2(\d{4})$/;
[03:45:16] <Cork> cool_boy: http://jsfiddle.net/AXCXR/4/
[03:45:59] <cool_boy> Cork: thanks, could you please point out mistake?
[03:45:59] <Cork> krambiorix: i don't see how it can
[03:46:07] <Cork> cool_boy: the list was quite long
[03:46:13] <Cork> class selectors without dot
[03:46:16] <Cork> unclised $()
[03:46:28] <Cork> the css missed ;
[03:46:37] <Cork> you didn't remove the old class when you added a new one
[03:46:42] <cool_boy> Cork: ahhh :O
[03:46:53] <Cork> btw <span class="first" /> <-- isn't valid html
[03:47:07] <Cork> only br img and a few other tags is self closing
[03:47:24] <Cork> / is just pointless data that the parser ignores
[03:47:33] <cool_boy> Cork: thanks a lot
[03:47:51] <Cork> unclised == unclosed
[03:47:52] <krambiorix> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/T2wS9/1/
[03:48:57] <Cork> js> print(/^2(\d{4})$/.test('2222') ? 'valid' : 'invalid')
[03:49:07] <Cork> <_<
[03:49:15] <Cork> bah the bot is gone...
[03:50:33] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/hx6GU/
[03:51:29] <Cork> krambiorix: so ya, that regex is strange
[03:51:50] <Cork> looks like you get false positives or something
[03:52:25] <BinaryKitten> Cork 2(\d{4}) ?
[03:52:44] <BinaryKitten> 2014 = 2(\d{3})
[03:52:50] <Cork> ya
[03:52:55] <Cork> BinaryKitten: that is the argument ya
[03:53:04] <BinaryKitten> ok
[03:53:42] <Cork> ahhh
[03:53:47] <Cork> opps
[03:53:50] <Cork> wrong test :x
[03:54:00] <BinaryKitten> heh
[03:54:15] <BinaryKitten> glad to see you're as infalable as the rest of us Cork :()
[03:54:16] <Cork> no i really can't see how that regex can actually work
[03:54:42] <Cork> BinaryKitten: i'm trying to figure out how he can get correct from http://jsfiddle.net/T2wS9/1/
[03:55:24] <Cork> ah right
[03:55:27] <Cork> lol
[03:55:32] <Cork> \2 is the same thing as 2
[03:55:37] <BinaryKitten> Cork i can't remember how to get the matches out of it
[03:55:40] <Cork> that was what tripped me up
[03:55:59] <Cork> ^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])([\/])(0[1-9]|1[012])\2(\d{4})$
[03:56:04] <Cork> is the same as
[03:56:08] <Cork> ^(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])([\/])(0[1-9]|1[012])2(\d{4})$
[03:56:41] * BinaryKitten bows at the RegEx-Fu master!
[03:56:58] <Cork> but that still doesn't explain how it eats the last /...
[03:58:02] <BinaryKitten> use regex in a string?
[03:58:08] <BinaryKitten> with different delim?
[03:58:34] <Cork> O_o
[03:58:34] <BinaryKitten> \2 also should be \2
[03:58:48] <Cork> how the f can (\2) match "/" ?!?
[03:58:52] <BinaryKitten> shouldn't it be ([\/])
[03:59:04] <Cork> wait...
[03:59:13] <cannap> (___o___) :D
[03:59:14] <Cork> can you use earlier matches from the regex as matches later in it?!?
[03:59:23] <BinaryKitten> yes!
[03:59:25] <BinaryKitten> of course#
[03:59:27] <Cork> that would explain it
[03:59:33] <Cork> super weird but...
[03:59:35] <BinaryKitten> repeat match!
[03:59:47] * Cork 's head explodes
[03:59:57] <Cork> ok learned a new part of regex
[04:00:38] <BinaryKitten> saves on repeating
[04:00:55] <Cork> well it means you can ensure the first and last separator is the same char
[04:00:55] <BinaryKitten> www.www.com  (www.)\1com
[04:01:16] <Cork> the regex used [\/-] before
[04:01:25] <Cork> so it allowed / and -
[04:01:34] <Cork> so it needed \2 there
[04:01:40] <buggin_out1> Hey guys any of your guys in here have some experience getting masonry (masonry.desandro.com) working on a design like this..

[04:26:21] <ska-fan> I know about replaceWith
[05:12:36] <ankurk__> Thank God it's Friday
[05:14:08] <fabioportieri> amen

[05:31:59] <ankurk_> Will jQuery.isNumeric() check for float?
[05:32:59] <shoky> why not check the docs?
[05:33:06] <shoky> floats are numeric, yes
[05:36:13] <ankurk_> thanks shoky :)
[05:37:36] <lianzinho> guys, I'm searching for a method to substitute an .append() method with something I could be sure when the loading is complete…
[05:38:22] <lianzinho> when I append an img, I need to get this img properties to keep going, but It's unstable right now
[05:42:10] <fRAiLtY-> Shouldn't this fire the getForm request line on click? http://pastie.org/8889714
[05:43:28] <shoky> you just replaced $(this) with something new
[05:43:49] <shoky> $(this) is not in the DOM anymore
[05:44:42] <shoky> so .getForm() probably returns nothing, whatever it is
[05:45:25] <shoky> save the form reference before replacing.
[05:58:15] <buggin_out1> Hey can anyone help me understand why I cant get the same alignment here with masonry http://www.lighcorelighting.com.au/shop/html/lightcore-march/index-masonry.html

[06:02:18] <shoky> fRAiLtY-: i assume data.submit() is for the jquery file upload plugin.. and i have no idea what sendRequest is. give more details before you ask such a question...
[06:28:56] <hellothere> yo anyone has any idea how validation works in jquery?
[06:31:24] <lianzinho> guys, is it possible do monitor for value change in a specific variable throughout  all the course of the plugin ?
[06:31:30] <body> anybody can name some jquery plugin that i can add responsive video in my website? it's made on simple html
[06:38:14] <decx> body i never understood how it works exactly but there's a css hack for that http://jsfiddle.net/decx/T5gWn/
[06:39:35] <ahref> I'm sure im doing something wrong here. But how do I avoid the entire page turning black when a jquery mobile panel opens in reveal mode. I guess its where im placing it in the DOM but :S. http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/2/ anyone :)?
[06:45:19] <henn1nk> hello guys.. i am creating new dom elements via ajax call.. how can i access the new dom elements in jquery then?
[06:47:28] <ahref> henn1nk,  are they added into the dom before you try and reference them?
[06:47:45] <henn1nk> ahref: no after :/
[06:47:46] <hearing> I am seeing a strange behavior with jQuery mobile's ajax navigation, but I am unsure if I just don't understand the way it is supposed to work
[06:48:22] <decx> if you create a document fragment you can reference them like any old element
[06:48:43] <hellothere> any good boy knows about validation jquery
[06:48:53] <keNzi> hi there, does anyone know whats wrong with this code? --> http://wklej.org/id/1292403/
[06:49:18] <keNzi> my #overlay and #boxpopup doesnt show on page (its blank)
[06:49:29] <henn1nk> ahref: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9412808
[06:50:03] <henn1nk> ahref:  my problem is now, jquery doesn't fire the contact_form submit action, cause i loaded this form in the code_form ajax request
[06:50:23] <henn1nk> ahref: it is a kind of "wizard"
[06:51:07] <hearing> i am seeing my relative urls getting their last directory cut off when navigating to pages in my jquery mobile app
[06:52:44] <ahref> Whilst we have all these problems on the table heres mine http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/2/ :) why is my page black like the panel when it is open :D
[06:54:05] <hearing> @ahref ui-panel-page-container-b
[06:54:27] <ahref> yeah?
[06:54:42] <f00se> keNzi: maybe 13 line - "function()" string is missing
[06:56:08] <ahref> hearing, ahh thats the class that does it, but why does that get added when the panel opens?
[06:56:38] <hearing> the b is a reference to a theme, perhaps that is defaulted for some reason..?
[06:56:45] <hearing> change it to -a
[06:57:10] <ahref> i thought things defaulted to a
[06:58:07] <hellothere> henn1nk: on your fiddler the request looks arlight?
[06:58:07] <hearing> hmm maybe not, oops
[06:58:47] <henn1nk> hellothere: hm
[06:59:21] <hellothere> do you have fiddler or smthing like it where u can sniff the ajax requests?
[07:00:11] <hearing> ahref  line 6
[07:00:30] <ahref> swipeClose?
[07:00:34] <hearing> and line 8
[07:00:46] <hearing>         .attr("data-theme", "b")         .panel({         theme: "b",
[07:01:07] <ahref> http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/3/
[07:01:14] <ahref> removed the .attr's
[07:01:33] <ahref> i want a black panel on a white page in reveal mode :S
[07:01:38] <ahref> so i set the panel to theme B
[07:01:45] <BrutusUnix> How would I mirror an array and then empty out the orignal?  I keep getting information by ref
[07:01:50] <hearing> http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/4/
[07:02:05] <hearing> oh ha
[07:02:06] <ahref> No i want the panel to be black
[07:02:09] <ahref> and the page to be white
[07:02:24] <ahref> unless you are not seeing what i see?
[07:03:19] <BillCriswell> BrutusUnix: for( var i = 0; i < original.length; i++ ) { new.push(original.shift()); } should work.
[07:03:45] <ahref> hearing, in overlay mode it doesnt happen
[07:03:48] <BrutusUnix> ok thanks
[07:04:34] <hearing> i wouldn't use the theme class for that, unless you are hugely invested in using them
[07:05:04] <BillCriswell> BrutusUnix: Er wait haha. It's not returning what I expect.
[07:05:18] <BillCriswell> Might have to .reverse original then use pop?
[07:05:26] <decx> what's the overhead there compared to new = old.slice(0); old = []
[07:05:52] <ahref> Why not, i though the theme's just applied themselves when specified. like in http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/api/themes.html
[07:05:57] <ahref> and not to the entire page
[07:06:03] <BillCriswell> decx: That's why I should be awake right now.
[07:06:27] <BillCriswell> BrutusUnix: What decx said is probably like, 100000000x better.
[07:06:36] <BillCriswell> -probably
[07:07:31] <BillCriswell> I was really over complicating that.
[07:07:43] <decx> i'm trying to grasp push .shift
[07:07:47] <hearing> ahref I don't know enough about the themes, like why is there an a and a b.. part of how theme roller is intended to be used? i dunno
[07:08:20] <hearing> you can apply settings to your page objects just like the panel objects, maybe that would solve
[07:08:23] <BrutusUnix> ok I'll do the slice()
[07:08:43] <hearing> i am seeing my relative urls getting their last directory cut off when navigating to pages in my jquery mobile app
[07:08:56] <BillCriswell> var a = [1,2,3,4,5], b = a, a = []; also does the trick
[07:09:08] <ahref> http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/6/ everything else now has theme a
[07:09:58] <jop008> I have this <div id="place"></div> if I want to isnert html can I use $("#place").append (chtml) ?
[07:10:07] <jop008> or must I use .html?
[07:10:08] <ahref> yes
[07:10:12] <ahref> use append
[07:10:21] <jop008> okay
[07:10:31] <ahref> append adds to it
[07:10:36] <ahref> html would replace everything inside it
[07:10:44] <xqo> hello, how can I get the dimensions of an image-file read with FileReader? http://jsfiddle.net/7JyZt/
[07:13:34] <BillCriswell> decx: http://pastie.org/pastes/8889953/text is what I Was thinking originally, for some reason.
[07:14:45] <jop008> If I put my htmll on the console and paste it in the rigth place screen is rendered fine but in the code using append wrong
[07:15:35] <BillCriswell> jop008: Sounds like some ajax loaded content?
[07:15:48] <jop008> No no ajax involved
[07:16:15] <jop008> this string is inserted <div class="divinfo" id="place_field_id">&nbsp;</div><p/><span class="divinfo" id="place_results_count">&nbsp;</span><p/><div data-role="fieldcontain"><label for="place">Plaatsen in de buurt</label><input id="place" type="text"  placeholder="Kies een plaats">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<div id="place_autocompleteContainer"></div></div>
[07:16:41] <decx> ah yes that makes more sense BillCriswell
[07:16:55] <jop008> when I do this manually in a div screen is okay and looks different if I use oel.append (string)
[07:17:48] <jop008> I will make a fiddle
[07:20:44] <ahref> "The framework applies the theme that is used for the page to the content wrapper. Before opening a panel that has display mode reveal or push, the page theme will be set to the same theme that is used for the panel. This is done to mask that most mobile browsers haven't finished painting the panel background when the animation to open it has already started." UGH, that explains the problem
[07:25:20] <jop008> This is my fiddle
[07:25:34] <jop008> I miss some space after the label Places nearby
[07:28:19] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/133/ after hardcoded you can see the string which is build up in the code if I paste it like this screen is good
[07:39:52] <cool_boy> hello! I am checking required validations using jquery on text fields. It is working but it dispalys required as many times I click on submit button. I tried removeclass before checking values in field but not working. Can someone tell me the way how to do it?
[07:42:41] <lianzinho> guys, I need to use a deferred inside a foreach loop and then use stuff which where modified INSIDE the deferred outside the loop… I'm having trouble to construct this… any suggestion?

[07:46:14] <lianzinho> haahaha
[07:46:24] <lianzinho> 2 days trying to do this stuff
[07:48:08] <jop008> what can cause this oel.append (chtml); wrong screen same string in the body screen okay
[07:48:26] <jop008> so using code screen is incorrect

[08:07:41] <BillCriswell> Does seem pretty cool. Maybe one day I'll get to build a fun animation.
[08:07:42] <BillCriswell> Carty: What did you try?

[08:08:03] <wunz> decx: is that you?
[08:08:10] <decx> i wish
[08:08:15] <decx> just saw it ;)
[08:09:29] <fabioportieri> Carty: .inactive:hover {
[08:09:38] <Guest5586> Hi! Could anybody explain me please: the plugin parameters look like this: $.fn.dataTableExt.oApi.fnReloadAjax = function ( oSettings, sNewSource, fnCallback, bStandingRedraw ),  and it is called like this: oTable.fnReloadAjax(getApiUrl('/user')), but why are settings are coming as the first param if I pass '/user' as the first one?
[08:09:39] <Jattenalle> good 'ol freenode
[08:09:44] <fabioportieri> Carty: your selector is wrong
[08:10:05] <Carty> fabioportieri: is it? :/ so I have to change it to that and it should work?
[08:10:10] <decx> don't specify inactive
[08:10:14] <wunz> i need to start picking up some html5
[08:10:22] <decx> if it doesn't have active it's inactive
[08:10:22] <wunz> impressive what it can do
[08:10:24] <Carty> decx: but I only want the .inactive ones to change
[08:10:26] <Carty> not all of them
[08:10:30] <fabioportieri> Carty: yes
[08:11:03] <Carty> fabioportieri: aaah, thank you Sir / Madam!  That is great!

[08:21:07] <cannap> jop008 when you use .addClass('bla') then will render bla direct check the demos

[08:42:32] <BillCriswell> Niiice.
[08:43:04] <BillCriswell> I wish ruby sass was as fast as libsass. =(
[08:43:17] <BillCriswell> and as good lol
[08:44:36] <ankurk_> I never got a chance to use sass, may on my personal I would use it
[08:44:39] <ankurk_> *be
[08:44:43] <ankurk_> *project
[08:45:04] <BillCriswell> Hmm... just googled "100 / 6" because I'm lazy and for some reason Google pops up a facebook sidebar thing. Wonder why.
[08:45:11] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: You're missing out.
[08:45:30] <ankurk_> is it that awesome?
[08:45:50] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:46:22] <decx> it's awesome if you work in a team, alone it's cumbersome imho
[08:46:41] <BillCriswell> I meant I wish libsass was as good as ruby sass, just not as slow.*
[08:46:50] <grafi> make it so
[08:46:51] <grafi> :p
[08:46:54] <BillCriswell> decx: Why so?
[08:47:02] <ankurk_> yeah decx why?
[08:47:34] <decx> another thing between me and my css
[08:47:59] <decx> depends on the project of course
[08:49:15] <BillCriswell> What drives me most crazy about writing CSS is how repetitive things get.
[08:49:41] <BillCriswell> Sass keeps it very DRY.
[08:49:50] <decx> let's just say the windows implementation isn't exactly bulletproof ;)
[08:51:32] <ankurk_> I hate Windows.
[08:51:44] <BillCriswell> decx: I use compass on most work projects and I don't run into too many issues.
[08:54:28] <decx> yeah i used compass with a team on a project and it was nice
[08:54:29] <jop008> Who can find this http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/134/ I am willing to spend some bucks for it
[09:00:39] <Macaveli> Why does this not work in IE8 https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/eb51a4823e30cbfb1d30
[09:01:07] <duch_kazatel> what part?
[09:01:22] <Macaveli> it just doesn't show
[09:01:24] <Macaveli> up
[09:01:25] <Macaveli> in IE8
[09:01:47] <duch_kazatel> any console errors?
[09:01:55] <duch_kazatel> if not, are you able to fiddle it real quick?
[09:02:28] <Macaveli> brb toilet
[09:03:50] <BillCriswell> jop008: I think your HTML is just bad.
[09:04:00] <decx> brb would have suffficed
[09:04:01] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell isn't that always the worst?
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> and Macaveli that's disgusting.
[09:04:20] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/136/ is appending properly.
[09:04:24] <jop008> But it is rendered okay hard coded you see
[09:04:27] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It sure is.
[09:04:49] <duch_kazatel> jop008 just because something renders does not mean it's good markup.
[09:04:56] <BillCriswell> jop008: I think the browser can maybe just handle it better than jQuery? I dunno.
[09:05:29] <duch_kazatel> jop008 things like <p/> tell me a lot.
[09:05:46] <jop008> Okay I will fiddle with html
[09:06:17] <duch_kazatel> jop008 you have to explicitly close that tag.
[09:06:20] <duch_kazatel> <p></p>
[09:06:32] <jop008> Okay
[09:06:44] <duch_kazatel> but then you have an empty p tag, which is useless.
[09:06:46] <duch_kazatel> so remove it.
[09:07:04] <duch_kazatel> because p cannot be void.
[09:07:04] <jop008> No difference
[09:07:53] <duch_kazatel> so what was the specific problem?
[09:09:46] <jop008> I chopped of the p tags
[09:10:36] <jop008> stays the same http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/137/
[09:10:52] <duch_kazatel> what was your specific problem?  i was late to the party.
[09:12:29] <anli_> Why am I getting a progress indicator on this page? http://jsfiddle.net/AtraC/372/
[09:13:34] <duch_kazatel> anli_ looks like you've got a console error.  maybe that's related.
[09:14:04] <Macaveli> duch_kazatel, my jsfiddle -> in IE8 he doesn't shown the back to top http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/HX3ww/20/
[09:14:31] <Skunkwaffle> Is there a quick way to determine which of two nodes come first in the DOM?
[09:15:13] <anli_> duch_kazatel: oh
[09:15:17] <BillCriswell> Weird, computer totally locked up.
[09:15:31] <duch_kazatel> Macaveli "he doesn't shown back to the top"?
[09:16:33] <Macaveli> IE8 doesn't show the back to the top duch_kazatel now added the css -> http://jsfiddle.net/HX3ww/21/
[09:16:44] <duch_kazatel> what does "show back to the top"?
[09:16:46] <duch_kazatel> mean
[09:16:55] <duch_kazatel> you mean you want a div to fade in?
[09:17:14] <BilldaCat> I'm trying to allow elements to move between 2 lists in a sortable via keyboard to add 508 compliance.. i'm running bind keydown events on each list, but when items go from list 1 to list 2, the bind doesn't seem to remove from the list 1 element or pick up the bind from the list 2 elements.  i've tried calling refresh on the sortable, reinitializing the sortable, but still not getting the 2nd list to respond to any keyboard pre
[09:17:15] <BilldaCat> on elements that are moved there.
[09:17:31] <Macaveli> duch_kazatel, when you click it the page scroll back to the top
[09:18:55] <Macaveli> duch_kazatel, updated version ->http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/HX3ww/22/
[09:19:36] <decx> Macaveli http://jsfiddle.net/decx/HX3ww/23/
[09:27:52] <Skunkwaffle> Is there way for me to take two nodes from somewhere in the DOM and determine which one comes first without having to search for a common ancestor and then searching for them.
[09:28:39] <blue_warlock> hello guys
[09:28:51] <blue_warlock> im trying to recall a page with .load method
[09:28:59] <blue_warlock> to edit in place my articles
[09:29:16] <blue_warlock> but the ckeditor its not working who knows why ?
[09:29:56] <blue_warlock> i have setted the call to the script in the main page and also in the page that must be loaded but its stucking
[09:30:05] <decx> ckeditor and most other wysiwyg editors work in an iframe
[09:30:29] <blue_warlock> hum
[09:30:39] <blue_warlock> only iframe ?
[09:31:00] <decx> mots likely
[09:31:26] <blue_warlock> so you advice the edit inplace replacing the div with an iframe right ?
[09:32:14] <decx> i wouldnt say it's an advice, more of a hunch
[09:33:13] <blue_warlock> dam it was cool because the edit page is adapting itself to the content with .load()
[09:34:01] <blue_warlock> maybe with a trigger ?
[09:34:48] <blue_warlock> i say that because its not easy to define the iframe width and resolution that user is using
[09:40:02] <bowenac> anyone know how to open a new thickbox, from inside a thickbox. I am using a thickbox to display shortcode options for wordpress. Inside that thickbox I have a button to open the media manger which works but it opens inside the current thickbox ifrmae. I would like to open it in the default media manager thickbox window.
[09:46:33] <[o_o]> HI, can anyone help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/NrmTW/4/
[09:46:43] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ [o_o]
[09:46:46] <[o_o]> when I click "Fetch Model" button, the request failed, but the default alert never happened
[09:46:59] <duch_kazatel> awww the bot's broken.
[09:47:44] <bird_lover> ok
[09:47:57] <duch_kazatel> and the request doesn't fail B)
[09:49:15] <duch_kazatel> it initially gets redirected.
[09:49:21] <bird_lover> duch_kazatel: did u check the console tab ?
[09:49:44] <bird_lover> the req fails
[09:49:54] <duch_kazatel> the second request fails.
[09:49:57] <duch_kazatel> the first one is a redirect.
[09:50:02] <BillCriswell> It redirects then 404s. Is that technically a fail?
[09:50:08] <BillCriswell> Ah ok. =)
[09:50:30] <duch_kazatel> i don't know if that counts as a fail technically.
[09:51:58] <bird_lover> duch_kazatel: ya, I'm sorry req doesn't fail, but why doesn't the alert window pop up when click "fetch model"
[10:05:29] <duch_kazatel> jop008 - if you want help, instead of PMing people with "starters", start from the beginning talk to the room.
[10:05:41] <duch_kazatel> Don't PM people unless they say they're cool with it/.
[10:05:54] <jop008> 5 hours I tried
[10:05:57] <jop008> I gave up
[10:06:09] <duch_kazatel> you aren't even actually trying.
[10:06:39] <duch_kazatel> you're not asking for help with your problem - you're asking for us to work on things that have nothing to do with your question.
[10:07:11] <bird_lover> John, what is ur question?
[10:07:19] <bird_lover> jop008: ?
[10:07:22] <duch_kazatel> jop008 finally, http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/sgxKJ/
[10:07:41] <duch_kazatel> he wants autocomplete with multiselect, but instead of originally asking that, he was giving me "starter" questions.
[10:20:04] <igcewieling> I must be brain dead today, I cannot see why the elements are not hiding.  http://jsfiddle.net/Zs4hz/2/
[10:21:47] <igcewieling> sorry to waste you time on that, it was a browser config issue
[10:35:00] <ahref> is there a way to avoid a jquery mobile panel's theme from being applied to the page when it is opened? http://jsfiddle.net/Bsf6j/7/ shows the problem. I want a black reveal panel and im getting a black page :(
[10:47:00] <BillCriswell> ahref: Hmm... somethings fucky.
[10:47:21] <ahref> Yeah i got that
[10:47:41] <ahref> I read in the docs that it does that temporarily whilst the panel opens to account for mobile client's slowness or something
[10:57:06] <jop008> I try to render a label and an input field like pool closed http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/169/
[10:57:53] <duch_kazatel> and you want it styled like pool closed?
[10:57:55] <jop008> It looks like styles are not used
[10:58:05] <jop008> Yes like pool closed
[10:58:12] <duch_kazatel> yeah looks like you need to init the dropdown.
[10:58:26] <jop008> but how
[10:58:49] <jop008> It is a text input fie;d
[10:58:51] <jop008> ld
[10:59:54] <duch_kazatel> $("input").textinput();
[11:00:03] <duch_kazatel> that's where you'd start.
[11:00:24] <jop008> so my input is wrong?
[11:00:27] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:00:31] <jop008> googled on this
[11:00:46] <duch_kazatel> you need to initialize the one that you added.
[11:00:56] <jop008> how to?
[11:01:12] <duch_kazatel> by running .textinput(); on the related input field.
[11:01:31] <jop008> new 2 me
[11:01:47] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquerymobile.com/textinput/
[11:02:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/171/
[11:03:20] <jop008> but that is not what I want
[11:03:28] <jop008> not the same as pool closed
[11:03:39] <duch_kazatel> right - that's where you start.
[11:09:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd look at the difference in what's rendered between the hardcoded version and not hardcoded version.
[11:10:21] <jop008> what is the default class for a lable?
[11:10:43] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to read the docs.
[11:10:46] <duch_kazatel> i'd go look at them.
[11:10:56] <jop008> thanks for help
[11:13:43] <jop008> doc is so good that you can find it the default class for a label
[11:17:33] <Dhvani> Hi Any one can help for qunit
[11:18:24] <jop008> I googled deffault class for label no hits
[11:19:27] <BillCriswell> jop008: Can't you just inspect the element?
[11:19:39] <jop008> good tip
[11:22:58] <duch_kazatel> guys who wants to do my work for me?

[11:23:41] <duch_kazatel> what is the best practice for using jquery mobile to do this
[11:23:46] <duch_kazatel> thanks in advance!
[11:24:01] <duch_kazatel> <<insert pastebin link with .erb files>>
[11:25:26] <BillCriswell> I wonder if it's safe to go into ##atom now... what a terrible shit show that was when it was released.
[11:25:44] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[11:25:48] <duch_kazatel> how is it btw?
[11:25:56] <BillCriswell> PS: I learned terrific and terrible used to mean the same thing.
[11:26:11] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I don't use it yet, but I love the idea of it.
[11:26:29] <BillCriswell> When I'm feeling brave I might switch over... but it definitely has some catching up to do.
[11:26:43] <ankurk_> Sublime Text ftw
[11:27:00] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Agreed, for now.
[11:27:13] <ankurk_> Sublime would have have been more popular if it's license fees were little less
[11:27:47] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: I agree, I think if they went to like $30 they'd sell triple, but I guess enough people are buying it at the price it's at now to not have to do that.
[11:28:53] <duch_kazatel> corporate customers like mine are part of it.
[11:28:54] <ankurk_> Many devs like me are still using on evaluation period
[11:29:00] <ankurk_> *it
[11:29:12] <ankurk_> just because it's license costs $70
[11:29:20] <duch_kazatel> yup.  well work it imo.
[11:29:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Agreed.
[11:30:00] <duch_kazatel> *worth jesus i can't type.
[11:30:55] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Yeah,it is definitely pricey for some. Luckily all it costs you for now is a popup once in a while.
[11:31:14] <ankurk_> but that can be annoying
[11:31:14] <duch_kazatel> every 50 saves, in fact!
[11:31:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah it can be.
[11:31:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I noticed that it pops up if I idle for a while as well.
[11:31:36] <ankurk_> I wonder why they have a unlimited evaluation period
[11:32:04] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: People would move right along if they couldn't use it.
[11:32:29] <ankurk_> I am actually waiting for the day when I get some money from freelancing :P
[11:32:34] <BillCriswell> At least if you can keep using it you'll get more reliant on it then maybe buy it.
[11:32:36] <ankurk_> and use it on license fees :P
[11:32:54] <BillCriswell> They're like drug dealers. Give you a little, get you hooked.
[11:33:13] <BillCriswell> It's like a $70 high for the rest fo your life haha
[11:33:46] <ankurk_> lol I might be reluctant since I am a student :P
[11:34:57] <BillCriswell> I thought they had student pricing but apparently not.
[11:35:50] <ankurk_> I seriously want them to introduce some sort of student pricing
[11:36:02] <ankurk_> I hate when classmates use Dreamweaver
[11:36:19] <jop008> finally cracked it not simple making your own nodes
[11:37:27] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: As long as they're in the code side of things 98% of the time I'm ok with it.
[11:40:24] <ankurk_> well, that's fine but schools should discourage using dreamweaver
[11:40:31] <igcewieling> I' have a <div> containing some visible <div>s and some display:none <div>s.  I'm using this, but it does not seem to work.  I get two lines with the same background, for example.  $('#help_cause_code_list > :visible').filter(':nth-child(odd)').removeClass('even').addClass('odd'); $('#help_cause_code_list > :visible').filter(':nth-child(odd)').removeClass('odd').addClass('even');
[11:41:03] <igcewieling> I tried several other selectors as well, the above is my latest attempt
[11:41:34] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: The WYSIWYG side of it yes, the text editor side of it isn't making any terrible habits.
[11:42:16] <ankurk_> I do remember using dreamweaver long ago but stopped using it for some reason
[11:42:21] <ankurk_> *myself
[11:47:30] <in_deep_thought> Right now, I have  $(".messages").append("<li>string</li>");
[11:47:38] <in_deep_thought> and it literally appends "string"
[11:47:47] <duch_kazatel> is messages a ul?
[11:47:47] <in_deep_thought> but string is a variable name defined earlier
[11:47:57] <in_deep_thought> yeah
[11:48:08] <in_deep_thought> I want it to append the variablee name
[11:48:11] <duch_kazatel> aaah i hate when people do that.  either way, you want  $(".messages").append("<li>" + string + "</li>");
[11:48:24] <BillCriswell> string concatenation
[11:48:26] <in_deep_thought> ohh that makes sense
[11:48:31] <BillCriswell> or however you spell that.
[11:48:37] <in_deep_thought> why do you hate when people do that?
[11:48:44] <jop008> I have this odivsel = $('<div/>', { "id" : cid + "_field_id", "class" : "divinfo", "text" : " " } ); how to insert text ?
[11:48:50] <jop008> I tried &nbsp;
[11:48:51] <spekode> BillCriswell: spelled correctly :)
[11:49:04] <jop008> but then this is displayed as text and not hidden
[11:49:05] <BillCriswell> spekode: I should reward myself with a pretzel
[11:49:10] <duch_kazatel> not the specifc thing - the multiline explanation.  a single sentence to sum it up without hitting enter until you're actually done is helpful.
[11:49:51] <in_deep_thought> duch_kazatel: ok I will do that from now on
[11:49:57] <BillCriswell> jop008: text: "Some text"
[11:50:15] <duch_kazatel> doesn't that just add a text attr?
[11:50:19] <duch_kazatel> which isn't valid.
[11:50:53] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It appears to add text to the element.
[11:50:59] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[11:51:02] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[11:51:08] <jop008> yes but I want invisible text
[11:51:24] <duch_kazatel> "invisible text"?
[11:51:24] <jop008> making the div the same size as with text
[11:51:33] <jop008> no it is collapsed
[11:51:47] <jop008> if I put &nbsp; in it it grows
[11:51:58] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsbin.com/sahaqago/1/edit
[11:52:00] <jop008> but with a create it is not possible to do so
[11:52:04] <BillCriswell> jop008: Right. You're adding a space.
[11:52:21] <BillCriswell> jop008: Use "html":"&nbsp;" instead of "text":"&nbsp;"
[11:53:24] <duch_kazatel> i might take a crack at writing my first plugin.
[11:53:27] <duch_kazatel> :toot:
[11:53:39] <jop008> okay
[11:53:41] <BillCriswell> Did you fart?
[11:54:01] <duch_kazatel> http://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-toot.gif
[11:58:39] <nhulea> its friday we have another pool party !
[11:58:50] <nhulea> havin*
[11:59:17] <duch_kazatel> noooo
[12:00:02] <ankurk_> I have never been to a pool party
[12:03:13] <duch_kazatel> they can be fun.
[12:03:17] <duch_kazatel> especially when booze is involved.
[12:03:36] <ankurk_> ahh booze
[12:03:45] <duch_kazatel> and a grill/barbeque.
[12:03:51] <ankurk_> I can never get beyond one bottle of beer
[12:04:04] <duch_kazatel> i remember those days
[12:06:52] <ankurk_> hehehe
[12:11:47] <igcewieling> http://jsfiddle.net/Zs4hz/3/   Click on the "show all" checkbox, notice how the zebra stripes are not updated.   Does anyone have any guidance?  I'm obviously doing something wrong, but I don't know what.
[12:13:08] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling hiding and showing is not the same as adding and removing.
[12:13:09] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:13:39] <igcewieling> Hmm?  I don't understand.   I'm selecting based on :visible so I ignore the hidden elements
[12:14:39] <duch_kazatel> console.log($('#help_cause_code_list > :nth-child(odd):visible').removeClass('even').addClass('odd'));
[12:14:41] <duch_kazatel> what do you see?
[12:15:29] <cprodigy29> on the jquery site they have an example of getJSON(). When would I need to use format: jsonp instead of json?
[12:15:51] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 when you need to work around CORS and the API endpoint allows wrapping in a callback function.
[12:15:54] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: I see the "match all direct decendents of #help_cause_code_list which are visible"
[12:16:37] <igcewieling> But like I said I'm not very good with selectors, especially the :ones
[12:17:00] <igcewieling> oh, sorry, I was distracted and not reading well.
[12:17:03] <duch_kazatel> #help_cause_code_list > :nth-child(odd):visible means "get me the odd-numbered direct descendents of #help_cause_code_list that are visible.
[12:17:24] <duch_kazatel> which is redundant in your case.
[12:17:43] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: ok so in the example I'm requesting the flicker api.. why doesn't it need to use jsonp there?
[12:17:55] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 because it allows CORS probably.
[12:18:13] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: but the access control?
[12:18:16] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling you'd probably be better served by filtering on CSS properties or manually iterating.
[12:18:20] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 huh?
[12:18:38] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: like headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'
[12:18:43] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: is that why?
[12:18:44] <igcewieling> Apparently I don't know enough to understand your answer.
[12:18:46] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[12:18:53] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[12:19:02] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: oh so I have that in my app so I don't need to use jsonp then
[12:19:14] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: only if my server didn't have cors
[12:19:15] <duch_kazatel> flickr needs that on their end.
[12:19:19] <duch_kazatel> their server.
[12:19:26] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling you're saying "give me all elements that are odd numbered which are also visible"
[12:19:33] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I'm talking about my rails app in my head but not typing it lol
[12:19:33] <duch_kazatel> your logic is all ready doing that.
[12:19:44] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 ah, yeah if your server allows CORS, you're fine.
[12:19:53] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: then why isn't it working?
[12:20:10] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling you're hiding all even numbered items, right?
[12:20:30] <igcewieling> correct.  That works.  Now try unchecking the box and watch it fail to re-stripe.
[12:20:56] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling right - it "fails" because you're hiding the even numbered items.  your selector is saying "give me all visible odd numbered items"
[12:21:06] <duch_kazatel> both odd numbered items are visible.
[12:21:25] <igcewieling> Are you saying $('#help_cause_code_list > :nth-child(odd)') will NOT match hidden elements?
[12:21:32] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: thanks for the help the other day too
[12:21:40] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: much appreciated
[12:21:48] <duch_kazatel> no, I'm saying that's only matching odd elements, which are still visible.
[12:21:58] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 of course.
[12:22:27] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: I think I'm starting to understand.
[12:22:57] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I've been googling for hours though and I can't grasp the concept of how my js page knows that I'm logged in after I get back success from the server
[12:23:15] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling your selector basically doesn't make any sense given this context because odd and even have nothing to do with the visuals and everything to do with the html.
[12:23:23] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: I think I need to put something in the header so the server knows
[12:23:24] <igcewieling> I thought the code before $('#help_cause_code_list > :nth-child(odd):visible') would fix that.
[12:23:50] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: how would I accomplish what I want to do?
[12:23:54] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling you're showing and hiding things - that's just adding display: none; to the css.
[12:24:13] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling you want to loop through the elements and go from there.
[12:24:31] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 right - session management.
[12:24:39] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: or I could avoid all this sillyness and use tables.
[12:24:52] <igcewieling> there are a zillion working examples of this using tables.
[12:24:56] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling that still won't solve your problem.
[12:26:03] <igcewieling> This is my remaining question.  Will :nth-child(odd) consider only visible elements when deciding what is odd or does it also consider hidden elements when deciding what is odd?
[12:26:21] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: with every json request to the server i would send the session by putting it in the header?
[12:26:31] <duch_kazatel> i all ready explained that :) "igcewieling your selector basically doesn't make any sense given this context because odd and even have nothing to do with the visuals and everything to do with the html."
[12:27:03] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: I'll take that as a "considers both hidden and visible elements"
[12:27:23] <duch_kazatel> exactly.  "the html" means "all elements in the DOM"
[12:27:30] <duch_kazatel> css notwithstanding.
[12:28:53] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: I thought I was limiting the scope to only visible elements by using $('#help_cause_code_list > :nth-child(odd):visible') and/or $('#help_cause_code_list > :visible').filter(':nth-child(odd)').removeClass('even').addClass('odd');
[12:29:23] <duch_kazatel> read the docs for that one again.
[12:29:32] <duch_kazatel> api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/ - "Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent."
[12:30:06] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: so no matter what I do to try and limit that it will always match all elements on the dom?
[12:30:11] <duch_kazatel> yes
[12:31:43] <igcewieling> If that is the case why do I not see even and odd classes being applied all over the place outside of the #help_cause_code_list ?
[12:32:07] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:32:19] <duch_kazatel> you're not doing anything outside of that.
[12:32:31] <duch_kazatel> by "the dom" i mean "the dom starting at your given base selector"
[12:33:11] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: "dom starting at my given base selector" rather than "the matched set of elements of your selector"?
[12:33:32] <duch_kazatel> i'm avoiding talking about your selector because you're confused about what you're selecting :)
[12:33:35] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: This tripped me up before. li:nth-child(even):visible wouldn't give you every even visible element, it would give you every visible element that is visible.
[12:33:54] <BillCriswell> every visible element that is even*
[12:34:18] <igcewieling> BillCriswell: What was your solution?
[12:35:56] <duch_kazatel> igcewieling this is one of many ways to do what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/Zs4hz/4/
[12:36:11] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: $('li:visible').filter(function(i){ return i % 2 === 0 });
[12:36:11] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily the best, but that should make sense.
[12:36:34] <igcewieling> BillCriswell: Thanks.
[12:36:43] <igcewieling> duch_kazatel: thanks your your help as well.
[12:37:33] <BillCriswell> No problem. I remember that screwing with me as well.
[12:37:53] <duch_kazatel> yeah psuedoselectors are funky.
[12:38:54] <BillCriswell> I was even more confused cause I was doing li:visible:nth-child(even), I think if I tried li:nth-child(even):visible it would have clicked sooner lol
[12:40:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[12:40:14] <duch_kazatel> this is why the docs are a good thing.
[12:40:22] <duch_kazatel> they're fantastic at explaining these kinds of things.
[12:42:30] <BillCriswell> It's just I used both those things separately fine in the past so I figured joining them together wouldn't be too weird.
[12:42:44] <duch_kazatel> oh definitely.
[12:42:50] <duch_kazatel> it feels really natural.
[12:45:32] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qipej/1/edit?html,css,output I think I was trying to do this, I was expecting item 5 and item 10 to be orange.
[12:46:42] <BillCriswell> Definitely felt right at the time haha.
[12:48:21] <blue_warlock> hello
[12:48:24] <blue_warlock> guys
[12:48:58] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: ok so I've been doing a lot of reading on this.. is the best way to manage the session by creating some sort of authentication_token?
[12:49:12] <blue_warlock> i have i div i need to insert inside this div a form in some particular moment
[12:49:40] <cprodigy29> blue_warlock: ?
[12:50:01] <blue_warlock> it must be like <div><form> my fields here </form></div>
[12:50:20] <blue_warlock> i mean
[12:50:29] <BillCriswell> `You're inserting the form in the div there.
[12:50:40] <blue_warlock> immediatelly after the div is open and closure immediatelly before the div closure
[12:50:54] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: jsbin.com =)
[12:51:11] <blue_warlock> one mo i make fiddle
[12:51:14] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 http://ajaxian.com/archives/managing-sessions-in-an-ajax-enabled-application
[12:51:20] <duch_kazatel> loooots of articles on the subject.
[12:51:58] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: perfect :)
[12:54:32] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I lunch.
[13:05:43] <amites> Any ideas why my .off() command isn't working?? line 27 -- http://jsfiddle.net/amites/w9Rqs/
[13:09:41] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/VrrLP/
[13:10:03] <blue_warlock> i have to inser <form> tags after div open and before div closure
[13:10:22] <blue_warlock> it must encapsulate the text
[13:12:08] <amites> blue_warlock: rather cryptic request for help
[13:13:56] <amites> blue_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/amites/VrrLP/1/
[13:24:11] <blue_warlock> thanks amites
[13:24:26] <amites> =)
[13:24:54] <cprodigy29> I have function setHeader and inside  xhr.setRequestHeader if I add more than one  xhr.setRequestHeader it fails, any ideas why?
[13:26:44] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: Could also look into .wrap()
[13:27:26] <blue_warlock> ah
[13:27:30] <blue_warlock> infact
[13:27:41] <blue_warlock> if i want to put outside div article ?
[13:27:48] <blue_warlock> must use .wrap ?
[13:28:25] <BillCriswell> <form><div></div></form> is what you want and you just have <div>?
[13:28:32] <blue_warlock> if need the form like <form><div></div></form>
[13:28:54] <blue_warlock> hey are you reading my mind ?
[13:28:56] <blue_warlock> :O
[13:29:02] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:29:06] <blue_warlock> lol
[13:29:07] <BillCriswell> Do you just have the div?
[13:29:15] <blue_warlock> yes
[13:29:24] <blue_warlock> im making some particular function
[13:29:30] <blue_warlock> on that div
[13:30:06] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: http://jsbin.com/zebirela/1/edit?html,css,js,output like this?
[13:30:57] <blue_warlock> amazing
[13:31:00] <blue_warlock> yess
[13:31:13] <blue_warlock> its so easy that i wanna cry T_T
[13:32:20] <BillCriswell> Yeah, jQuery makes lots of shit easy.
[13:35:24] <ankurk_> One lesson learned today, do every possible validation on server side, don't just rely on client side
[13:35:27] <duch_kazatel> always
[13:35:39] <duch_kazatel> well, at least, make sure you at least do server.
[13:35:45] <ankurk_> yeah
[13:36:47] <mehrdad__> hi, anyone know how can i prevent nivo slider from messing up the images, for the lack of a better word
[13:36:57] <rodorgas> client side validation should just be used to save server, but anyone can inject arbitrary data
[13:37:21] <mehrdad__> i mean, the images are the same size , yet they load up zoomed in, and then jump to original size
[13:37:28] <mehrdad__> i don't get wth is wrong
[13:37:44] <mehrdad__> i haven't had a smooth experience with nivo anyway
[13:37:52] <duch_kazatel> rodorgas for a variety of reasons, doing some simple validation client-side is fine, but yes, you should ALWAYS validate server-side as well.
[13:37:58] <BillCriswell> mehrdad__: Set a width and height on them or hide the slider till images are loaded.
[13:38:17] <mehrdad__> thx, i'll try that
[13:39:53] <BillCriswell> Is there a library that lets you do like .... validate.json and have that configure server sie and client side validation or is there something you'd probably have to do from scratch?
[13:40:37] <duch_kazatel> oooh.
[13:40:47] <BillCriswell> Writing validation for php and javascript separately equals zero fun.
[13:40:48] <duch_kazatel> hrm.  it sounds like there should be.
[13:41:03] <duch_kazatel> i know in node that's stupid easy :P
[13:41:14] <BillCriswell> Hahaha, fair point.
[13:41:34] <BillCriswell> I should really learn Node better, I bet it could make a lot of things easier for me.
[13:41:44] <duch_kazatel> yes.  it would.
[13:42:22] <BillCriswell> I've writte little modules and shit for it and played with express. Never actually built anything though.
[13:42:59] <Bloomberg> hi Guys!!
[13:43:11] <duch_kazatel> we're running one site on it and working on another.
[13:43:21] <Bloomberg> Someone can tell me how to restrict the required value for a select input?
[13:44:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Nice.
[13:44:48] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg what do you have so far?  a fiddle would be nice.
[13:44:50] <BillCriswell> I'm a total newbie with certain things. I'd have no idea how to even like... put an express app on a webserver.
[13:45:04] <BillCriswell> Total ignorant on administrative stuff.
[13:45:08] <amites> Any ideas why my .off() command isn't working?? line 27 -- http://jsfiddle.net/amites/w9Rqs/
[13:45:09] <duch_kazatel> we did exactly that actually.
[13:47:29] <duch_kazatel> amites because you're trying to remove a delegate handler that doesn't exist.
[13:47:33] <duch_kazatel> remove the second argument.
[13:47:52] <ankurk_> well, I have a question now too. I have a very long list of options like this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/13a6d6dbf7d090d44940. When a selecting some thing from another select, I just want to hide options with value 2 & 4. What would be the most efficient way to do it?
[13:48:03] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: So is there like a command you run from some control panel that just handles those requests?
[13:48:37] <duch_kazatel> we did it via heroku, which iirc basically we tell it to pull the most recent copy of a branch and then run a file.
[13:48:42] <amites> thank you duch_kazatel
[13:48:49] <duch_kazatel> that file has everything the node app needs to start running.
[13:48:51] <duch_kazatel> or something like that.
[13:49:04] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That's so simple. So just like go to directory run "node app"
[13:49:14] <duch_kazatel> node app.js, yeah
[13:49:28] <duch_kazatel> or just app.js if you make the file executable.
[13:49:29] <BillCriswell> not sure I ever typed the .js part
[13:49:35] <duch_kazatel> you usually don't need to.
[13:49:40] <BillCriswell> Oh ok haha
[13:49:48] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ huh?
[13:50:00] <duch_kazatel> you want to hide option value="2" and option value="4"?
[13:50:10] <ankurk_> yeah
[13:50:24] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Go through each option and if option.indexOf('2') > -1 || option.indexOf('4') > -1 hide it.
[13:50:36] <BillCriswell> Ohhh.
[13:50:40] <BillCriswell> Even easier.
[13:51:08] <duch_kazatel> $('#devCode option[value="2"]').hide()
[13:51:14] <duch_kazatel> $('#devCode option[value="4"]').hide()
[13:51:28] <duch_kazatel> berb
[13:51:35] <ankurk_> My brain is fried
[13:54:53] <BillCriswell> Hm, not sure they can be hidden?
[13:55:35] <ankurk_> they can be hidden, but I am trying to find most simplest way
[13:55:41] <ankurk_> or I guess I am confused
[13:56:24] <BillCriswell> I'm having no luck hiding them.
[13:56:50] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: http://jsbin.com/haxaxigu/1/edit?html,js,output example.
[13:57:28] <BillCriswell> Disabling them just to prove that the filter is working.
[13:58:30] <ankurk_> ohh! thanks man! I think I got an idea
[13:59:56] <duch_kazatel> back.
[14:00:23] <ankurk_> fuck, I need to hide all except those two :/
[14:01:07] <ankurk_> .not() to the rescue
[14:02:27] <duch_kazatel> be careful with that.
[14:02:49] <BillCriswell> Is the only option to remove options to hide them?
[14:03:05] <duch_kazatel> actually with only 59 items that shouldn't be too bad.  you might want to copy that stuff over to a fragment, modify that, then replace the whole shebang.
[14:03:20] <motaka2> 	can any one please tell me why I cant set .recs table width in this page? http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department
[14:04:11] <ankurk_> yeah, I can hide them or just make a clone no?
[14:04:15] <BillCriswell> motaka2: The content is too wide.
[14:04:26] <duch_kazatel> do the clone, edit the clone, replace the original.
[14:04:32] <duch_kazatel> reduces overhead.
[14:04:34] <BillCriswell> That sucks.
[14:04:37] <motaka2> BillCriswell: Why? it contains nothing
[14:05:11] <BillCriswell> motaka2: I see a bunch of inputs.
[14:05:21] <BillCriswell> The big red one with all the shit inside right?
[14:05:51] <motaka2> BillCriswell: shit ? yes I am talking about the red one
[14:06:05] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Figure of speech for the ignorant!
[14:06:13] <BillCriswell> Ok. Yes, it contains all the inputs and stuff.
[14:07:03] <motaka2> BillCriswell: yes, and those inputs have no width and yet it gopes out of the page
[14:08:07] <BillCriswell> motaka2: inputs aren't fluid.
[14:08:21] <motaka2> BillCriswell: What do u mena?
[14:08:25] <motaka2> mean!
[14:08:28] <motaka2> mean*
[14:08:58] <BillCriswell> An input won't automatically adjust to its container.
[14:10:34] <motaka2> BillCriswell: So what should I do ?
[14:11:10] <BillCriswell> motaka2: You can make them fluid, or make one in particular smaller if you like the size of the rest. Many ways to approach it.
[14:11:54] <motaka2> BillCriswell: How can I make them fluid ?
[14:13:20] <BillCriswell> motaka2: Standard CSS. Try doing .recs select {
[14:13:31] <BillCriswell> width: 130px; } and you'll see the table at 500px.
[14:13:58] <motaka2> BillCriswell: I didnt know this
[14:14:01] <motaka2> lemme see
[14:15:54] <motaka2> so it sets all input width like the maximum among them ?
[14:16:21] <BillCriswell> Not sure I'm following you.
[14:16:33] <duch_kazatel> no, it sets them all to width: 130px
[14:16:42] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[14:16:55] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel is a good clearer-upper
[14:16:59] <duch_kazatel> i try :)
[14:17:11] <duch_kazatel> clarity of questions is probably 1/3 of issues we get here.
[14:17:25] <BillCriswell> motaka2: The select's width would be based on the longest option text wise I believe.
[14:17:29] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Agreed.
[14:17:29] <cprodigy29> using ajax and beforeSend I am attempting to set headers..   like xhr.setRequestHeader('passkey', 'Bar');.. if I use more than one it doesn't work properly
[14:18:29] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: BillCriswell isnt there a neater way so as I ask it to have 500px, it also akes select and inputs smaller?
[14:19:35] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 what error are you getting?
[14:20:15] <BillCriswell> motaka2: You can set input, select { width: 100%; } but I'm not sure how well that would go down.
[14:20:21] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: 404
[14:20:43] <BillCriswell> Maybe just 98% if you you're not using border-box.
[14:20:55] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 have a fiddle?
[14:21:13] <blue_warlock> BillCriswell
[14:21:19] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: jsfiddle?
[14:21:35] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.com
[14:21:49] <motaka2> BillCriswell: thx, I still look for a better way
[14:21:50] <blue_warlock> is there any trick to let ckeditor works after a jq trasformation ?
[14:21:52] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1268673/set-a-request-header-in-javascript
[14:22:10] <Heinrich> Is jquery.transit.js compatible with jquery 1.11.0?
[14:22:27] <BillCriswell> blue_warlock: No idea.
[14:22:31] <blue_warlock> i was thinking to div .replaceWith() txtarea
[14:23:00] <blue_warlock> hum let me try
[14:26:33] <BillCriswell> I flipped my one screen vertical, 45 lines of code. Bad ass.
[14:27:11] <duch_kazatel> we have a lot of devs that do that with these 24" dell ips widescreens.
[14:27:48] <BillCriswell> It's a lot better than the 26 lines I got on my macbook pro haha
[14:28:01] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[14:28:23] <BillCriswell> At absolute full screen in sublime I get 32.
[14:29:07] <duch_kazatel> i get 82
[14:29:21] <BillCriswell> Dammnnn
[14:29:33] <BillCriswell> font size?
[14:29:43] <BillCriswell> I'm at 12px... with a bit of line height cause I like space.
[14:30:05] <duch_kazatel> 1920 * 1200 with font at 8px
[14:30:19] <BillCriswell> Eak, could never do 8.
[14:30:33] <duch_kazatel> the reso makes it plenty readable.
[14:31:06] <BillCriswell> Maybe I need glasses.
[14:31:13] <BillCriswell> Ok I'm headed out. Have a good weekend!
[14:31:13] <duch_kazatel> i do, too.  my sight is terrible.
[14:31:16] <duch_kazatel> enjoy man
[14:33:58] <duch_kazatel> aaaand now boondock saints.
[14:37:25] <linagee> when using .html() to set html, is there a way to include javascript? as soon as I have a <script> tag inside, I seem to get an error.
[14:38:34] <linagee> or I guess it doesn't like my </script> tag..... hrm
[14:39:22] <duch_kazatel> why are you including javascript like that?
[14:41:23] <linagee> duch_kazatel: $("#blah").click(function() { $("#blah_new").dialog().html("things to show on the dialog"); });
[14:42:38] <linagee> things to show on dialog doesn't take <script> tags. I could .load() some file instead, but then it just becomes harder because then I can't include perl variables before outputting.
[14:42:51] <linagee> argh. this code base makes me so stressed out.
[14:43:07] <duch_kazatel> wait you're not dynamically generating scripts like that are you?
[14:43:19] <linagee> duch_kazatel: yes. :(
[14:43:39] <linagee> duch_kazatel: existing code base. I'm trying to keep a 1940s house standing and all I have inside is a hammer and some nails. :(
[14:43:47] <linagee> (or thats what it feels like.)
[14:43:49] <blue_warlock> BillCriswell gone ?
[14:44:14] <duch_kazatel> yeah he left.
[14:44:16] <blue_warlock> do you know if .wrap can have different start and different end ?
[14:44:30] <duch_kazatel> linagee just render out a big object with the data you need instead.
[14:45:26] <linagee> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to capture the input from the form before the dialog pops up and put it into the new dialog. so - it needs to be done dynamically. ack. this is some form of torture.
[14:45:35] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock huh?
[14:46:01] <linagee> duch_kazatel: the form variables of the dialog are not accessible until the dialog is created...
[14:46:06] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock i don't believe so.
[14:46:17] <duch_kazatel> linagee ah, ajaxing it?
[14:46:31] <linagee> duch_kazatel: well, I guess I'll have to. :(
[14:46:48] <duch_kazatel> linagee why don't the vars exist until after the dialog is created?
[14:46:51] <linagee> duch_kazatel: here's what really bites: I've been working on some fresh code I've done in angularjs. and going back to this is just..... horrid. :(
[14:47:22] <duch_kazatel> haha
[14:47:40] <duch_kazatel> i actually hate angular personally.  munging markup and js like that feels gross.
[14:47:54] <linagee> duch_kazatel: dialog 1 pops up. it has some number you'd enter on the form. it has a button to pop up dialog 2 with some tax rate info. using the form variables from dialog 1.
[14:48:12] <linagee> duch_kazatel: at least it forces me to keep the MVC separate.
[14:48:34] <duch_kazatel> aaah.
[14:48:48] <linagee> right now the M V and C are all munged up.
[14:49:10] <blue_warlock> Bill before told me about .wrap ("<form>")
[14:49:16] <blue_warlock> but
[14:49:18] <linagee> perl that renders HTML, does SQL queries and such, and gives me a headache. :)
[14:49:38] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock i don't think you can supply different tags, but i could be wrong.
[14:49:39] <blue_warlock> i have found on jquery site that can be used ("<form></form>")
[14:49:55] <blue_warlock> not differnt
[14:50:04] <blue_warlock> just need to add something in the end
[14:50:09] <linagee> duch_kazatel: not using any sort of well known library either. (like Catalyst/etc.)
[14:50:11] <blue_warlock> before closure of form
[14:50:32] <blue_warlock> ("<form method=post><input type=submit value=Invia /></form>")
[14:50:41] <linagee> duch_kazatel: nor any automated testing
[14:51:01] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock check out the example titled "Wraps a newly created tree of objects around the spans. Notice anything in between the spans gets left out like the <strong> (red text) in this example. Even the white space between spans is left out. Click View Source to see the original html.>"
[14:51:20] <ankurk_> I think I won't be calling it a day anytime soon
[14:52:26] <linagee> duch_kazatel: hah! I got it working. just escape it like this: <\/script>
[14:52:32] <linagee> the cruft lives for another day longer. :(
[14:52:37] <duch_kazatel> linagee that's... terrible hahaha
[14:52:43] <linagee> duch_kazatel: very
[14:56:06] <linagee> duch_kazatel: wait wait
[14:56:23] <linagee> duch_kazatel: let me spread some more terrible on it for you.... :(  its being included in perl, so I have to double escape it.
[14:56:26] <linagee> <\\/script>
[14:59:38] <blue_warlock> duch which is the function to add something immediatelly after div closure ?
[14:59:53] <blue_warlock> duch_kazatel
[15:00:06] <blue_warlock> .prepend89 ?
[15:02:34] <blue_warlock> .after()
[15:02:37] <blue_warlock> =)
[15:03:28] <Heinrich> Is jquery.transit.js compatible with jquery 1.11.0?
[15:03:39] <blue_warlock> YAYYYYYYYYY GOT ITIIITITITITITTI
[15:07:54] <krambiorix> what can be possible reasons my modal dialog overlay is not shown?
[15:08:16] <duch_kazatel> that's... a terribke question.
[15:08:19] <krambiorix> ow forget it
[15:08:21] <krambiorix> i found it :D
[15:08:26] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[15:08:29] <krambiorix> i know, but i was desparate
[15:08:43] <krambiorix> fiew
[15:15:43] <duch_kazatel> ! work beer soon!
[15:18:04] <m312> Hi
[15:18:56] <duch_kazatel> hello
[15:19:59] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: not sure if you said something earlier but in getJSON can you not have more than one header sent?
[15:20:32] <duch_kazatel> for json?  you can have multiple.
[15:20:37] <duch_kazatel> jsonp doesn't use headrs.
[15:21:09] <duch_kazatel> *headers
[15:28:10] <m312> http://jsbin.com/sipiruru/1/edit?html,output , how do I get query to throw an ajax request with knowing which radio button was checked?
[15:29:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/sipiruru/2/edit
[15:29:20] <duch_kazatel> like thgis.
[15:29:22] <duch_kazatel> *this
[15:30:37] <m312> ...how do I know if id=radio1 or id=radio2 changed?
[15:30:45] <m312> ...was clicked
[15:33:03] <m312> duch_kazatel:
[15:33:50] <duch_kazatel> you want the ID?
[15:34:09] <m312> yes
[15:34:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/sipiruru/3/edit
[15:35:52] <m312> Awesome, thank you!!!!!
[15:37:10] <m312> duch_kazatel: you are amazing!
[15:37:15] <m312> duch_kazatel: have a great night!
[15:38:50] <duch_kazatel> you too man.
[15:38:56] <duch_kazatel> i'm about to get work beer
[15:40:38] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel:  xhr.setRequestHeader
[15:41:56] <duch_kazatel> cprodigy29 what about it?
[15:42:02] <duch_kazatel> did you read the thing I sent earlier?
[15:42:17] <duch_kazatel> also: some headers are protected.
[15:43:52] <cprodigy29> duch_kazatel: yea i did.. i was trying to set X-AUTH-TOKEN
[15:44:47] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[15:44:54] <duch_kazatel> my brain is dead today.
[15:57:03] <cool_boy> I am trying to put validations of html form with the help of jquery. So I tried to download  "jquery.validate.pack.js" from but in the package there is no file with this name but there is  'package.json' are these files same? If yes I am not able to validate my form.
[15:57:09] <cool_boy> on*
[15:57:54] <blue_warlock> hell
[15:58:12] <blue_warlock> i did the edit in place with the iframe
[15:58:51] <blue_warlock> but after editing the content the website reload page in the iframe =(
[15:59:51] <nhulea> work beer
[16:02:04] <blue_warlock> is it possible theres not a way to load ckeditor in a div ?
[16:04:26] <coldhead> i think it relies on the iframe, blue_warlock
[16:05:54] <coldhead> cool_boy: did you do it like this? view-source:http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[16:07:43] <blue_warlock> uff
[16:07:45] <cool_boy> coldhead: yes I did but I am confused with "jquery.validate.js" file I cant find in package
[16:07:53] <blue_warlock> it sux really
[16:10:21] <blue_warlock> is it possible to reload the parent page with a script inside iframe page
[16:10:27] <blue_warlock> ?
[16:10:59] <blue_warlock> maybe this one
[16:11:00] <blue_warlock> window.top.location.href = "http://www.site.com";
[16:13:13] <cool_boy> coldhead: please have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/k9tRm/
[16:13:55] <rodorgas> cool_boy: what do you want me to look?
[16:14:35] <blue_warlock> yes it workssss
[16:15:50] <cool_boy> rodorgas: I said to coldhead , but if you can help me please you are welcome I want to validate html form with jquery validator here is what I am doing http://jsfiddle.net/k9tRm/. I have renamed jquery validator file to "validate.js" and it is in same folder as 'index.html'
[16:17:07] <coldhead> we can't see the files you are including, cool_boy :(
[16:18:03] <rodorgas> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:18:03] <coldhead> cool_boy: why don't you try linking to http://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-validate/
[16:18:17] <coldhead> if you can't find the file you need
[16:18:30] <rodorgas> jquery is not imported properly
[16:18:49] <|RicharD|> Hi
[16:19:01] <cool_boy> coldhead: I was searching on google and I found this as a validator plugin. google suggested at top thats why I chose it.
[16:19:05] <|RicharD|> How I can remove the status hover after I click a link ?
[16:19:30] <|RicharD|> I want remove only the status hover or report to the normal status the link
[16:19:34] <|RicharD|> not delete the css class
[16:19:42] <rodorgas> coldhead: ctrl+shift+i shows web inspector in safari/firefox/chrome. it'll help you debug javascript, errors are printed there
[16:20:10] <cool_boy> rodorgas: which one the validator or basic jquery?
[16:20:47] <rodorgas> cool_boy: both of them
[16:21:36] <cool_boy> rodorgas: basic is working I put alert() and that is working fine , cant say about validator plugin because cant see it working.
[16:22:15] <coldhead> cool_boy: we can't tell why it isn't working if we can't see your actual files
[16:22:31] <coldhead> can you upload to a real server?
[16:22:32] <rodorgas> cool_boy: alert() doesn't use jquery
[16:22:32] <cool_boy> rodorgas: about import I can assure that plugin is in same folder and is renamed with the same I have impoted
[16:23:04] <rodorgas> cool_boy: use a cdn as coldhead suggested
[16:23:21] <rodorgas> you are using a relative path
[16:23:26] <anjen> |RicharD|: if yu mean by using jquery instead of removing the css hover, then you can simply use jquery's hover(), although I think it'd be easier to tweak the css
[16:23:28] <rodorgas> but you are not in your server
[16:23:54] <|RicharD|> anjen: Now i try
[16:24:04] <|RicharD|> but I don't want hover the link
[16:24:10] <|RicharD|> I want remove the hover :)
[16:24:42] <anjen> yes, how are you causing the hover effect in the first place |RicharD| ?
[16:24:57] <|RicharD|> because the user click on the link
[16:25:10] <cool_boy> rodorgas: can you see if I host on server?
[16:25:11] <|RicharD|> that do an ajax request and then I change color of the link
[16:25:20] <|RicharD|> but the status is still hover/active
[16:25:33] <rodorgas> cool_boy: yes, but its not needed
[16:25:49] <anjen> |RicharD|: The click is :active, not :hover. You can use mouseout to accomplish
[16:25:55] <cool_boy> rodorgas: I have given a lot try but not able to debug what is wrong
[16:26:36] <anjen> |RicharD|: or simply remove the css :active effect
[16:26:47] <|RicharD|> but i don't want remove
[16:26:51] <|RicharD|> for always
[16:26:51] <rodorgas> change <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script> to location http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js
[16:27:07] <bradix14> anyone know a way to import the default jQueryMobile theme into themeroller? Is that possible?
[16:27:31] <rodorgas> cool_boy if you want this to work on jsfiddle
[16:27:37] <cool_boy> rodorgas: it is at location becaue I have copied it in same folder
[16:27:49] <cool_boy> both .js files in same folder,
[16:28:04] <anjen> Then use css active and hover to acomplish these things. Otherwise, you handle them using Jquery's hover, which requires two functions, the one that casues a mohover effect and the alternate when the mosue isn't on the item
[16:28:15] <anjen> |RicharD|:  ^^
[16:28:47] <rodorgas> cool_boy but you are aware that it doesn't apply in jsfiddle, right?
[16:28:48] <anjen> *mouseover and mouseout
[16:29:12] <|RicharD|> Ok thank you!
[16:29:33] <anjen> |RicharD|: see http://api.jquery.com/hover/  :)
[16:29:49] <|RicharD|> yes i'm on it!
[16:29:59] <anjen> sweet! good luck
[16:30:05] <|RicharD|> Thank you!
[16:31:20] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[16:38:44] <cprodigy29> I really want to finish this step.. in jQuery how would I pass my token to the server in a request to let it know that I'm authenticated?
[16:44:38] <coldhead> cprodigy29: are you using .ajax() or similar?
[16:44:52] <coldhead> you could just pass that as an extra variable in your data object
[16:45:27] <duch_work_beer> cprodigy29 https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ - "headers "
[16:47:02] <cprodigy29> coldhead: .ajax()
[16:47:46] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: ok I did that and if I try to send two differ setHeader items it fails
[16:48:31] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: for instance xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/vnd.smashcounter.v1'); and xhr.setRequestHeader('X-Auth-Token', '12345'); */
[16:48:46] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: doesn't send the Accept one
[16:49:28] <duch_work_beer> cprodigy29 what browser are you in?
[16:50:12] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: firefox
[16:50:36] <duch_work_beer> hrm.
[16:51:08] <duch_work_beer> why aren't you using headers: {}?
[16:51:34] <cprodigy29> let me show you the code if thats ok
[16:52:06] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9423361
[16:52:41] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: it's pretty much a one page javascript app that connects to the api authenticates and then returns some data
[16:55:59] <duch_work_beer> right, why not use headers: {}?
[16:56:11] <duch_work_beer> instead of calling a function to set them?
[16:56:33] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: hmmm not sure what you mean
[16:56:45] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: oh in the head area
[16:57:24] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: nm headers in the ajax request
[16:57:28] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: i looked it up lol
[16:57:42] <duch_work_beer> yeah.
[16:58:51] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: and now I understand the pre-flight request too
[16:59:25] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: everything I've seen says to use beforeSend though
[17:00:36] <duch_work_beer> cprodigy29 huh?  for what?
[17:01:16] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: to set the headers
[17:01:27] <duch_work_beer> if you're using $.ajax, use all of it imo.
[17:01:35] <duch_work_beer> why wouldn't you?
[17:02:31] <coldhead> cool_boy: we are here
[17:03:50] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: that doesn't work either
[17:04:10] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: it causes a 404 not found on url
[17:04:36] <duch_work_beer> cprodigy29 then your api is broken.
[17:04:38] <duch_work_beer> >.>
[17:06:59] <cool_boy> coldhead: okay can you ´please have a look on server? access link http://ukylegal.net78.net/  username: server10.000webhost.com, user:a1441440,  password:asdfgh123, server: server10.000webhost.com
[17:07:18] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: so the request method is options
[17:07:30] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: on my server app it says  headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'X-AUTH-TOKEN, X-API-VERSION, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Origin, Authorization'
[17:07:31] <cool_boy>  user:a1441440    password:asdfgh123  server: server10.000webhost.com *
[17:07:52] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: so if I use Authorization: "blah" that should go right?
[17:08:24] <duch_work_beer> cprodigy29 i have no idea.
[17:08:30] <coldhead> cool_boy: this loads for me okay, i can now try to figure out the problem
[17:08:46] <cool_boy> coldhead: please
[17:16:50] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: i think it treats Accept different
[17:17:40] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: i tried it with two other names, made up ones, and  they both show up in the Access-Control-Request-Header
[17:17:49] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: which does the preflight check
[17:18:01] <cprodigy29> duch_work_beer: but accept won't show up with another
[17:20:33] <coldhead> cool_boy: i think i found your problem!
[17:20:46] <cool_boy> coldhead: please let me know
[17:20:54] <coldhead> cool_boy: you misspelled required. you have "reqired", it should be "required"
[17:21:01] <coldhead> in your script.js
[17:21:07] <cool_boy> f**
[17:21:52] <cool_boy> coldhead: thanks a lottttt!!
[17:22:39] <cool_boy> coldhead: you cant imagine how I am feeling  right now. I am checking it from long time and could not find out :O
[17:22:43] <coldhead> you are welcome cool_boy!
[17:23:06] <coldhead> cool_boy: the important lesson is if you have a problem please try to give #jQuery a link to a live demo
[17:23:13] <coldhead> then we can investigate
[17:23:17] <duch_work_beer> jsfiddle is the best always.
[17:24:10] <coldhead> duch_work_beer: not if there are problems with external files
[17:24:20] <coldhead> somethings are too gomblex for jsfiddle
[17:24:25] <cool_boy> coldhead: sure I would. and is there not any way to know spell mistake in jquery? like if I misspell document . Is there any tool which can tell me ?
[17:24:44] <coldhead> cool_boy: i think the validate plugin should tell you but it doesn't
[17:24:54] <duch_work_beer> coldhead sure, but generally you should be able to distill everything down to its most basic components.
[17:24:55] <duch_work_beer> imo.
[17:24:59] <coldhead> i don't know of a tool that would fix that for you, you just have to be careful
[17:25:17] <coldhead> duch_work_beer: totally agree for pure jquery problems but plugins are another issue
[17:25:17] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: what is jsfiddle?I am not aware of . I will google for it.
[17:25:22] <coldhead> live demos are always a nice option
[17:25:35] <coldhead> duch_work_beer: you already linked us to a jsfiddle example, it didn't help :)
[17:25:36] <duch_work_beer> how are plugins another issue?
[17:25:47] <duch_work_beer> you can troubleshoot plugins on jsfiddle just fine.
[17:25:53] <coldhead> because you can't host umpteen plugins on jsfiddle
[17:25:57] <coldhead> well maybe YOU can but i can't
[17:26:02] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[17:26:05] <duch_work_beer> huh?  yes you can.
[17:26:26] <duch_work_beer> http://i.imgur.com/3fUnJMY.png
[17:26:34] <duch_work_beer> you reference them in there.
[17:26:36] <snover> coldhead: i see you found another one
[17:26:51] <coldhead> that's linking external resources, duch_work_beer
[17:26:57] <coldhead> you still need to host them somewhere
[17:27:00] <coldhead> snover: god help me
[17:27:31] <duch_work_beer> you can do that from github/.
[17:27:59] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: :jsfiddle is a pastebin, isn't it?
[17:28:24] <duch_work_beer> cool_boy it's better than that because it allows you to run the code.
[17:29:27] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: first I pasted my code here but coldhead was not able to see code . Thanks
[17:29:38] <duch_work_beer> pasting code in the channel is a bad idea.
[17:29:53] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: I did not paste code on channel
[17:30:09] <duch_work_beer> what do you mean by "i pasted my code here"?
[17:30:18] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: on jsfiddle
[17:30:21] <duch_work_beer> getting a working example in a fiddle is generally your best bet either way.
[17:30:45] <cool_boy> duch_work_beer: thanks I would prefer jsfiddle.
[17:31:41] <coldhead> good chat, guys
[17:31:47] <coldhead> let's all take a 5 minute break
[17:31:55] <duch_work_beer> i've been breaking for a WHILE :D
[17:33:35] <cool_boy> coldhead: me too I really need a break , thanks again :)
[17:54:15] <cool_boy> coldhead: are you back?? how to show error message after radio button group? it is showing on first radio button
[17:54:33] <cool_boy> coldhead: http://ukytech.web44.net/contact.html
[17:57:23] <coldhead> cool_boy: there are a few fixes but they aren't very nice: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4915751
[18:01:32] <cool_boy> coldhead: not getting how to use it.
[18:06:01] <coldhead> cool_boy: it's pretty easy if you look at the documentation or examples or try it out
[18:06:04] <coldhead> cool_boy: http://jsfiddle.net/shQB4/
[18:06:43] <cool_boy> coldhead: aah it is .javascript. I thought is jquery
[18:07:02] <cool_boy> I havn't used javascript yet
[18:07:29] <coldhead> jquery IS javascript
[18:07:54] <cool_boy> coldhead: thanks :)
[18:18:13] <cool_boy> coldhead: doesn't seems working http://jsfiddle.net/83xjk/ everything stopped
[18:21:02] <coldhead> cool_boy: you need to include jquery on jsfiddle
[18:21:06] <coldhead> and the validate library
[18:21:27] <coldhead> and then finally you need a comment between each key: {}, key2: {}, key3: {}
[18:21:29] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/83xjk/2/
[18:25:51] <cool_boy> which keys? I did not get and then finally you need a comment between each key: {}, key2: {}, key3: {}
[18:26:48] <coldhead> line 10 of the fiddle
[18:26:55] <coldhead> is added , after the close }
[18:27:15] <tw2113> how's your second day coldhead ?
[18:27:17] <cool_boy> ohhh got it thanks coldhead for the tutorial of jsfiddle too
[18:28:51] <coldhead> tw2113: i'll let you know tomorrow, i guess
[18:33:31] <riwarren> I am trying to change the ajax endpoint link in an <a> element based on which tab is currently active on the page. I wrote jquery .click(function() { .. }); in javascript, and I can see that when I click on different tabs it changes the href link (using $(selector).attr('href',newlink); ).  But when I click the link, i can see in the network tab of google web tools that it is calling the original
[18:33:31] <riwarren> link/ajax endpoint.   Anyone have any idea why this is happening?  it doesn't make any sense.
[21:03:04] <Atamido> I'm trying to create a link when another link is clicked, using something like this:
[21:03:06] <Atamido> $(document).ready(function(){$("a.choose").click(function(event){$('#remove').append(<a href='#' class='choose'>test</a>);});});
[21:03:08] <Atamido> The new link is created, but the click function isn't triggered when the new link is clicked.  I'm having trouble finding an explanation of why, or how I'm supposed to be approaching this.
[21:03:35] <Atamido> Any links or explanations for this?
[21:05:02] <Atamido> I should note that I'm new to JavaScript as of this week, so I fully expect it to be something obvious.
[21:05:10] <shoky> Atamido: you need to use event delegation
[21:05:14] <shoky> read about it here-
[21:05:15] <shoky> `api on
[21:05:15] <b-ot> shoky: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[21:05:40] <shoky> you'd wanna do something like   $('#remove').on('click', 'a.choose', function(event) { ... })
[21:05:58] <shoky> assuming #remove is a static element
[21:06:17] <shoky> and that the original a.choose are also inside it. otherwise use a more general container
[21:07:04] <Atamido> Thanks, I'll read through that and give it a whirl.
[21:09:09] <shoky> Atamido and the explanation why it didn't work for the new link is because you only attached event listeners on the original links, on page load
[21:09:57] <Atamido> I figured it was probably something along those lines.
[21:10:51] <Atamido> I was thinking there would be a way to refresh what was loaded in the "ready" state, but it looks like I'll need to restructure my JavaScript some.
[21:11:33] <shoky> event delegation lets you do it elegantly without any need to "refresh"
[21:12:02] <shoky> you attach a listener to a parent container element, listening for events bubbling up from descendant elements
[21:17:07] <Atamido> Does the <script> need to be after the relevant portion of HTML?
[21:17:20] <Atamido> It didn't seem to work until I moved it to the bottom of the page.
[21:26:41] <shoky> if it's in the top then it should work if it's in a $(document).ready handler
[21:56:59] <ericandrewlewis> if i want to select elements with a data attribute that contains a string
[21:57:28] <ericandrewlewis> e.g. <div asdfjkl="something"></div> and <div asdfqwer="something-else"></div>
[21:57:53] <ericandrewlewis> jQuery, I want elements that have an attribute that starts with "adsf"
[22:37:08] <bradix14> anyone know a way to import the default jQueryMobile theme into themeroller? Is that possible?
[22:38:28] <bradix14> I'm also wondering if there's a way to completely turn off jQuery's handling of certain <a> links
[22:41:02] <Guddu_> Can i add more values to a serialized form data manually?
[22:45:04] <Guddu_> I get this error when i try tp push a value
[22:45:05] <Guddu_> Uncaught TypeError: Object csrfmiddlewaretoken=oeM0QGn1uWPIU5GRqHhQwxuxCaieXeT3&Station-002101=on&Station-002103=on&Station-002105=on&Station-002107=on&Station-002109=on&Station-002113=on&Station-002115=on&Station-002117=on&Station-002119=on&002102...<omitted>...h'
[22:45:25] <Guddu_> This is how i tried
[22:45:27] <Guddu_> var data = $('#Work_Sation_Control_Form').serialize();
[22:45:27] <Guddu_> 			data.push({name: "code",value: code});
[22:49:57] <systemfault> So... are you even sure that data is an array?
[22:51:42] <ericandrewlewis> Guddu_: serialize spits out a string
[22:52:31] <ericandrewlewis> you can concatenate the serialized string with another string if you wanted
[22:53:20] <Guddu_> ericandrewlewis, systemfault Thanks
[22:53:27] <Guddu_> I will make the change now
[22:58:07] <Macaveli> Is it possible to get offset to work in IE8 I have the following fiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/VWOU/fL5AV/
[23:01:36] <ericandrewlewis> Macaveli: i don't see why not
[23:02:06] <Macaveli> ericandrewlewis, It's not showing because I think (this).scrollTop() not working
[23:02:12] <Macaveli> I'm verifying this right now
[23:03:16] <Macaveli> ericandrewlewis, as I thought it stays 0
[23:15:42] <Junior> hello
[23:18:11] <Junior> Hello, i am using the http://jdewit.github.io/bootstrap-timepicker/ plugin to display a timepicker on my page using: jQuery('#reservation_time').timepicker({timeFormat:'hh:mm:ss'}).val(""); All works well but the problem arises when i want to change the "minuteStep" (ex: to have a step of 30 minutes instead of 15) after making a ajax call to get the step. How can i "re-initialize" the timepicker because i cannot change the "15 minutes step". Thanks!
[23:21:23] <Whirl3d> If I have downloaded several pages of a site's shopping carts and want to build an array of items that I can extract locally to create a database, what's the best way to go about it?
[23:22:05] <Whirl3d> From console, I can log the information that I need...but do I need to copy/paste the log data into a file and parse it?
