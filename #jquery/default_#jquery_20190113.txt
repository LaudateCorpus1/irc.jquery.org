[09:41:58] <jozefk> Is there some better way of doing this instead of so much repeating? https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/KSd6SDYBk7/
[09:42:33] <jozefk> I need to have multiple input fields on the same page and to jump to different links based on user input
[09:51:13] <shoky> jozefk: use a class instead of ids. and in the handler you can use $(this).val()
[09:57:56] <jozefk> OK I got that part. I can test it. But how can I get different links for window.location.replace?
[10:08:28] <jozefk> @shoky https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9fbMJwgKcG/ I'm not sure the last line would work coz I need to jump on different link based on user inputs. Since I have mupltiple inputs I have mulitple groups of links as well.
[10:08:41] <shoky> jozefk: oh didn't notice that. one way is to use a data-xxx attr on the buttons and read it with $(this).data('xxx')
[10:09:58] <shoky> <button class="button" data-link="foo">      $(this).data('link') === "foo"
[10:10:56] <shoky> jozefk: uhm but why aren't you just using normal <a> links..?
[10:11:24] <shoky> <a href="#foo">...
[10:12:55] <jozefk> shoky: because they are many
[17:44:45] <devi8> is there a way to determine mouse events on a browser scrollbar withot implementing your own scrolling system?
[18:10:57] <tokam> Hello, is anyone familiar with this awesome tool?
[18:10:57] <tokam> https://datatables.net/manual/data/
[18:11:16] <tokam> I tested in once on a really simple table and once on my real table...
[18:11:23] <tokam> on my real table I get this error: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25377637/datatables-cannot-read-property-mdata-of-undefined
[18:11:57] <tokam> no sorry ... I will paste the error message (it seems to be even an other one, but the answer despite of it seems guiding in the right direction)
[18:12:14] <tokam> my table uses two header rows in <thead> and sometimes colspan attributes and so on
[18:12:29] <tokam> This is the error message
[18:12:30] <tokam> jquery.dataTables.min.js:90 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'mData' of undefined
[18:12:30] <tokam>     at HTMLTableCellElement.<anonymous> (jquery.dataTables.min.js:90)
[18:14:22] <tokam> maybe there is a way to configure it right?
[19:08:40] <sine0> example site has button fixed on right that when clicked, opens up a contact form. the main site behind darkens and becomes unusable during the contact form focus (it happens with ad blockers pop up as well)

[19:16:39] <UberStrike88> Hey guys, can I ask a question? I can't seem to make my Jquery code to generate a html table from a JSON data. (The data in the paste is just mock and not real) but I just get this error:http://i.imgur.com/RcWmDdW.png here is the js code: https://pastebin.com/NvCU1V3s and the html code https://pastebin.com/J73SD1xq
[19:17:08] <UberStrike88> Could someone help me explain what I am doing wrong?
[19:20:11] <shoky> UberStrike88:  about line 1027  maybe you're using a really old jquery version that doesn't have .on()..    and for the other error..  delete line 1002.  and then you want data.length  not data.id.length  and keep using data, not data.id
[19:22:12] <shoky> also don't quit irc :\
[19:30:53] <UberStrike88> sorry got disconnected any response please resend sorry :(
