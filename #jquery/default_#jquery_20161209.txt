[00:37:04] <chaitime> when people are doing ajax calls, there is an x-auth-token option, why would anyone use this when its in clear text and anyone can then see your token and start making API calls?
[01:56:53] <Cork> chaitime: uh, i hope you're doing your calls over https
[01:57:17] <Cork> cause that is how it is suppose to be protected
[01:59:16] <chaitime> Cork: huh
[01:59:25] <chaitime> if you do view page source you can still see all the shit
[01:59:41] <Cork> if you mean the server can see it, sure
[01:59:49] <Cork> but you can't ever get away from that
[02:00:13] <Cork> if you hash the password before sending it, it just means the hash is the "real" password instead of what you typed
[02:14:03] <errakeshpd> when contain a file attached - success callback is not comming inside   $("#contact_form").bind('ajax:complete', function() {   alert("success") })
[02:15:51] <errakeshpd> is there any other methode to get the success  ?

[08:01:41] <z1haze_work> anyone have much experience with jquery.validator? i am trying to make one or another field required, so i created a method and used the addMethod functionality, but for some reason, i cannot get the error message to appear on attempted submit, it only shows when i attmepted to type into the field
[08:02:03] <z1haze_work> all other 'required' fields show the error message when i attempte to submit, these fields only put the red box
[08:02:31] <z1haze_work> example can be found here: http://bit.ly/2hsXdg3 im referring to the phone number fields toward the bottom
[08:31:25] <AdamPDotty> example too messy
[08:56:35] <z1haze_work> lets say i have 2 elements on the page with a class of 'foo' and i want to have a function to check if at least one of them is filled out.. normally id do like $('.one').is(':empty') && $('.two').is(':empty') but how do i do this when they have the same classs
[09:03:41] <Birliban> Hi, can someone pls have a look at http://www.bootply.com/x07H4vtBdw (its jquery, used in bootstrap). Its about the jquery part, is this the best way to do it?
[09:20:37] <AdamPDotty> z1haze_work: like $('.foo:empty').length == number
[09:20:37] <z1haze_work> what am i doing wrong here? https://jsfiddle.net/c58qkj4s/ driving me mad
[09:20:51] <z1haze_work> O.o thats a good idea
[09:20:57] <dan_j> Any ideas why this isn't firing?
[09:20:58] <dan_j> $('#amount').on('change keyup paste',function(){
[09:21:04] <dan_j> I've checked the id and it's correct.
[09:21:10] <z1haze_work> im more concerned now with my my check isnt workign though
[09:21:15] <z1haze_work> i made a fiddle to kinda illustrate
[09:22:07] <AdamPDotty> have to go to the loo first
[09:22:07] <TotallyNotKim> use ids or at least names or assign some data fields to it
[09:22:16] <TotallyNotKim> if its going into a form you'll need a name anyway
[09:22:31] <z1haze_work> they have names but jquery validator doesnt use names it uses classes
[09:22:50] <z1haze_work> and i dont see the point to add a class to the markup, this should work, right?
[09:23:01] <shoky> z1haze: :empty is not for empty value
[09:24:08] <shoky> .val().length
[09:24:35] <TotallyNotKim> 'The :empty selector matches every element that has no children (including text nodes)'
[09:25:07] <z1haze_work> oh
[09:25:13] <TotallyNotKim> so it'll always return true on your input, because it has no childerns
[09:25:16] <z1haze_work> well that makes more sense :\
[09:25:59] <TotallyNotKim> Birliban: looks ok for me, as long as you replace .delay() with some actual logic :P
[09:26:00] <AdamPDotty> dan_j: I'd say no change
[09:26:29] <dan_j> AdamPDotty: i'm entered text into that input box so there is a change
[09:26:41] <dan_j> AdamPDotty: http://www.clever-energy.co.uk/makeapayment/
[09:26:45] <AdamPDotty> cause you are
[09:26:48] <TotallyNotKim> does the element exists before you bind to it?
[09:27:05] <AdamPDotty> hmm no
[09:27:13] <AdamPDotty> have a look at "domReady"
[09:27:57] <dan_j> Hmm. When I put a breakpoint on the .on(change line, and watch the $('#amount') object, it exists. I'll alter it to delay the binding.
[09:28:46] <shoky> dan_j: it's paymentamount, not amount
[09:29:07] <AdamPDotty> yeah, but that is right in JS
[09:29:16] <dan_j> shoky: I changed it after i posted my question, just in case 'amount' was conflicting with something. Long shot.
[09:29:32] <dan_j> Its working now that i've wrapped it in $(document).ready
[09:29:35] <dan_j> Thanks.
[09:29:44] <dan_j> Weird, I've not had to do that on a different page.
[09:29:52] <TotallyNotKim> thats what i said
[09:30:05] <shoky> depends where you include your <script>
[09:30:06] <dan_j> TotallyNotKim: yep. thank you.
[09:30:06] <TotallyNotKim> you bind the event before the dom element existed
[09:30:10] <AdamPDotty> your class names are horrible btw
[09:30:11] <dan_j> Both pages are in the header
[09:30:29] <AdamPDotty> always include it in header
[09:30:32] <shoky> then you were doing something in an event handler, not on page load
[09:30:49] <dan_j> AdamPDotty: not a pro at this as you can see :)
[09:31:12] <shoky> it's fine to include scripts at the end of <body> too
[09:31:19] <shoky> no need for $(document).ready then
[09:31:29] <AdamPDotty> nah, far from fine
[09:31:36] <AdamPDotty> body is for markup
[09:32:05] <TotallyNotKim> might increase performance 'under the fold'
[09:32:08] <TotallyNotKim> or use async
[09:33:22] <shoky> that hardly makes it far from fine ;]
[09:33:25] <rethus> how do I check if all required marked input-fields are valid, before I do an ajax-call? Currently I use click() to catch the button-press. But may the problem, that the require-check only is done by submit?
[09:34:28] <TotallyNotKim> there are librarys for that
[09:35:17] <TotallyNotKim> you also use the blur and focus events if you want to do it manually
[09:36:48] <AdamPDotty> usually you check right before submit anyway. You can also check on change.
[09:37:53] <rethus> AdamPDotty: ok, thank you. But If I use "require" on html5 he has an own kind of check and show popup. Can I trigger this?
[09:38:10] <rethus> Or have I to create an own check for each input-field?
[09:38:26] <AdamPDotty> That should only check for empty.
[09:38:44] <AdamPDotty> I would expect that to be triggerable, but do not know how.
[09:38:58] <rethus> AdamPDotty: 'input type="email' require ' check for valid mail-adress.
[09:39:30] <AdamPDotty> ah yes those types
[09:39:51] <AdamPDotty> first try would be a simple element.change()
[09:40:07] <rethus> question is. how can I let html5 do the work, and only fire ajax if all fields are valid
[09:40:08] <AdamPDotty> or element.trigger('change')
[09:40:36] <AdamPDotty> That is a problem of the browser.
[09:40:59] <AdamPDotty> You should not be able to submit as long as required fields are empty or invalid.
[09:43:35] <rethus> ah ok. see now. The wysiwyg editor kicked my required parameter.
[09:44:03] <snfgf> hey!!!!
[09:45:36] <snfgf> i have a question
[09:46:43] <snfgf> I'm passing an object to an $.ajax call, with an error: function defined as, error: function(textStatus, errorThrown) { ... }
[09:46:53] <snfgf> the prototype of 'error' is Type: Function( jqXHR jqXHR, String textStatus, String errorThrown )
[09:47:13] <snfgf> so, why isn't the first parameter of my error function a jqXHR object?
[09:52:43] <shoky> snfgf: it is..
[09:52:52] <shoky> snfgf: you just didn't name it properly :P
[09:52:59] <snfgf> that is correct
[10:07:24] <Tentacled> Whoa, this channel is actually alive!
[10:08:26] <Tentacled> So... anyone have an idea why doing $("form").submit() inside an AJAX success function doesn't work..? It's executed, my custom submit handler gets called, it returns true, and... the form is not submitted. :/
[10:09:54] <Tentacled> Specifically, the success function does  formvalid=true; $("form").submit();   and my onsubmit handler starts with  if (formvalid) return true;  - and this is followed. Except that the form isn't submitted. :/
[10:15:03] <shoky> Tentacled: cant really know without seeing a testcase/jsfiddle
[10:15:38] <shoky> in any case, you can try $("form")[0].submit()
[10:17:36] <snfgf> hmm
[10:19:07] <Tentacled> shoky: hmm, unwrapping from jQ, you mean? Let's see...
[10:19:27] <Tentacled> Nope.
[10:19:33] <z1haze_work> how can i bind a function to both the submit event and a blur event?
[10:19:42] <shoky> Tentacled: then you're doing something wrong
[10:19:57] <shoky> z1haze_work:
[10:19:59] <shoky> oops
[10:20:19] <shoky> z1haze_work: $('form').on('submit', myfunction);  $('input').on('blur', myfunction);
[10:20:31] <z1haze_work> ah ok
[10:21:08] <Tentacled> It's like .submit() only called my onsmubnit handler, and didn't even try submitting afterwards. As if my 'return true' in the handler was not honored at all.
[10:21:17] <Tentacled> I'll try to condense it to a paste/fiddle...
[10:21:49] <Tentacled> s/onsmubnit/onsubmit/
[10:21:59] <Tentacled> I cnat tpye
[10:22:08] <guardian> hello, I have a noob question. To show/hide a search box clearer (cross icon), would you use toggle()/hide() or addClass()/removeClass()? What's best practice?
[10:22:34] <snfgf> hmm
[10:23:07] <shoky> guardian: classes for styling is best practice
[10:23:45] <snfgf> I am trying to create a class, function myObject() { this.sayHello = function() { console.log('helloooo'); } }
[10:24:00] <snfgf> then I am adding methods to the prototype of this object
[10:24:26] <snfgf> myObject.prototype.sayGoodbye = function() { console.log('Goodbye!'); }
[10:24:28] <snfgf> BYT
[10:24:29] <snfgf> BUT*
[10:25:10] <snfgf> when I make an $.ajax request inside of these methods I'm adding to the prototype, I can't access the sayHello method
[10:25:24] <shoky> snfgf probably you're using the wrong `this`
[10:25:32] <shoky> `this` changes in javascript in each function call
[10:25:37] <snfgf> sorry, sayHello is actually an object, it should be called Greeter or something
[10:25:38] <shoky> an ajax callback is a function
[10:25:45] <shoky> it has a different `this` than outside it
[10:25:48] <snfgf> hmm
[10:25:58] <snfgf> isn't there only 1 this?
[10:26:00] <shoky> you can do  var self = this;  outside
[10:26:02] <shoky> no.
[10:26:21] <shoky> or you can just not use js's fake "classes" and not use "this"
[10:26:23] <shoky> and you win ;D
[10:26:46] <snfgf> i thought OO was good style
[10:26:54] <shoky> but if you do , then take the time to learn about `this` in javascript
[10:28:25] <shoky> OO is ok.  "classical" OO with classes and inheritance and shit that e.g. java has  is not too great (imo) but in any case, javascript doesn't have that.
[10:28:33] <shoky> javascript's OO is totally different
[10:28:41] <shoky> no classes in js
[10:32:46] <guardian> shoky: thanks
[10:33:13] <snfgf> hmm
[10:34:22] <snfgf> i am working with some code that makes $.ajax requests and has defintiions for succes:, and error:, and then right inside of the success function, there is, var data = $.parseJSON(data); if (isSuccessful(data)) { ...
[10:34:30] <snfgf> ^which tests a status field in the JSON object
[10:34:50] <snfgf> do you think since is necessary, since it's basically say, if (successful) { if (successful) { ...
[10:35:31] <snfgf> do you think THIS is neccessary*
[10:39:31] <projectui> morning/evening ladies and gents
[10:40:42] <projectui> and now for the obligatory opening "breaking the ice joke"... shouldn't the channel be named $jquery instead?
[10:42:26] <ilhami> hi
[10:42:38] <ilhami> is it illegal to use jquerys ajax over fetch? :)
[10:42:52] <shoky> snfgf: we have no idea what that isSuccessful function is checking.. seems like it's checking the actual response json data to see if it has a successful status or whatever - it's not checking if the ajax request was successful
[10:43:05] <shoky> ilhami: huh? in what country?
[10:43:11] <ilhami> hahaha
[10:43:17] <shoky> ;p
[10:43:28] <ilhami> well I didn't mean illegal but I heard it's better to use fetch()
[10:43:49] <snfgf> what is fetch
[10:43:58] <shoky> it's illegal to use something just because "you heard it's better"
[10:44:03] <shoky> so don't use it because you have no idea why :)
[10:44:03] <ilhami> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API
[10:44:35] <snfgf> hmm
[10:44:49] <snfgf> is this not as popular as $.ajax? do they do the same thing
[10:45:04] <shoky> fetch is built in to js (in modern browsers)
[10:45:08] <shoky> $.ajax is not
[10:45:18] <ilhami> ya. :-)
[10:45:20] <snfgf> so fetch is quite new?
[10:45:25] <ilhami> it's still experimental
[10:45:28] <shoky> ya
[10:45:58] <projectui> I'm sorry.. i read fetch.. and I think the movie "mean girls"
[10:46:24] <ilhami> whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?
[10:46:54] <projectui> "Mean girls" with Lindsay Lohan
[10:47:04] <projectui> "that's so fetch"
[10:47:14] <projectui> sorry. rambing.
[10:47:23] <shoky> sorry, nobody knows this movie ;p does not exist
[10:47:26] <projectui> rambling* omg I can't type this morning
[10:47:43] <ilhami> Lindsay Lohan is still making movies?
[10:47:50] <projectui> lol this was back in 2004
[10:47:54] <projectui> when she wasn't a stoner.
[10:48:00] <ilhami> I heard she converted to Islam.
[10:48:01] <projectui> or druggie
[10:48:53] <projectui> lol I didn't know this. she in-fact was seen with their book
[10:48:58] <ilhami> All Hollywood actors are on drugs man. :p
[10:49:09] <projectui> the good ones are...
[10:49:12] <projectui> :'(
[10:49:49] <ilhami> have you guys ever dated a developer?

[10:50:30] <projectui> I have not. I would <3 to find one, but they are few and far between
[10:51:03] <ilhami> projectui, me too man
[10:51:10] <ilhami> it's so difficult to find one.
[10:51:51] <rethus> Can anybody  help me with this "setCustomValidation-Popup" ? Whya does this.value is empty here, even if I put something in the field? http://codepen.io/suther/pen/vyaGoz?editors=1111
[10:52:58] <projectui> ilhami: southern boy with southern draw working in IT in a northern state filled with rednecks.... I just changed weather types... still a bunch of rednecks around lol
[10:53:42] <ilhami> oh man I am dreaming about a wife with red hair :p
[10:53:46] <ilhami> I like women with red hair.
[10:54:08] <projectui> my preference is dark brown or black.
[10:54:27] <rethus> does the this have to be $(this) in the snippet?
[10:54:35] <projectui> I know I just joined the channel, so I'll refrain from my joke about women with red hair
[10:55:36] <ilhami> red haired girls are beautiful and special.
[10:55:43] <ilhami> and rare.
[10:56:16] <projectui> they are. they are a genetic rarity
[10:56:22] <rethus> hey guys, look at my snippet, if you solve it, you got an hidden image of red hair girl ^^
[10:56:40] <ilhami> haha rethus I will look at it in 5 minutes.. brb
[10:56:42] <rethus> its a hidden tresure queset
[10:57:16] <projectui> I would love to help but I've only been cutting my teeth on jquery for the past few months.
[10:58:47] <MikeD_> "cutting my teeth" ?!?  that's such a disturbing expression
[10:59:53] <projectui> southern term (maybe other locations) for a baby teething and their teeth breaking through the gums to allow them to eat solid foods and grow
[10:59:55] <MikeD_> oh, it's about baby teeth... not about actually cutting them into pointy shapes
[11:00:04] <projectui> lol per-xactly
[11:00:12] <MikeD_> i had a horror/freak show about it
[11:00:49] <MikeD_> people do some weird things to themselves - i'll save you the image search results
[11:02:04] <projectui> no intentions on looking. anyway. you guys ok if I hang around a bit? my job is taking me more and more into the dark world of jquery and it helps to have a resource to pick at the minds of "professionals" such as yourselfs ;-)
[11:02:18] <projectui> yourselves* damn... fingers going to fast to catch that one
[11:02:28] <dglambert> yo
[11:02:30] <MikeD_> haha, we're all just hanging around
[11:02:40] <projectui> at least logically
[11:05:39] <rethus> solved it. Get the red head for my own ^^
[11:05:50] <projectui> what was das issues?
[11:06:16] <rethus> logical issue. I have to move the each-loop into my onsubmit-stack
[11:06:21] <ilhami> oh this is German :D
[11:06:48] <rethus> ?
[11:07:02] <projectui> you know what? i said das before I even clicked the link.... that's just random lol
[11:07:29] <ilhami> rethus, the text in your snippet was German.
[11:08:06] <rethus> lol 'what was das issue"  is even partial german ^^
[11:08:24] <ilhami> Herrn / Frau  - im folgenden „Einsteller“ genannt
[11:08:29] <ilhami> talking about this.
[11:08:31] <projectui> that's what I was meaning.
[11:08:48] <projectui> I used some german not knowing your test page was in german
[11:10:39] <projectui> so is there any other asp.net or mvc razor peeps in here
[11:10:48] <projectui> are there* damn my grammer
[11:11:31] <ilhami> Microsoft technologies are not allowed in here. :-)
[11:11:57] <snfgf> var arr = [ 4, "Pete", 8, "John" ]; var $spans = $( "span" );
[11:12:13] <snfgf> ^is it normal to use a $ in variable names when using jquery?
[11:12:16] <projectui> I'm merely here for the jquery aspect
[11:12:18] <ilhami> I was just kidding projectui. :p
[11:12:23] <shoky> snfgf: yes
[11:12:28] <snfgf> ty
[11:12:54] <projectui> i know :-D
[11:13:02] <projectui> we can't all be perfect...
[11:13:11] <projectui> too bad I never really got into OOP with php
[11:13:27] <rethus> windows using is like diving with a submarine. If you open a Window, the trouble starts ^^
[11:14:07] <ilhami> projectui, working with Laravel right now.
[11:14:15] <projectui> rethus: thats why you know the proper place to put windows, between the sky and the ocean... they work well in their own level
[11:14:40] <projectui> I had to google that
[11:14:43] <projectui> never heard o fit
[11:14:46] <projectui> of it*
[11:15:12] <adavia> does ~ in css select all elements that are preceded by the former selector?
[11:16:34] <shoky> adavia: yes, preceding siblings
[11:16:40] <adavia> Umm
[11:16:52] <adavia> Whats wrong with this then http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1728/
[11:18:32] <ilhami> there is a #css channel adavia.
[11:19:34] <adavia> I know.. but usually dead. Anyways just curious about this
[11:19:35] <shoky> adavia: are the radios even changing..?
[11:19:41] <shoky> adavia: they are hidden..
[11:20:20] <shoky> adavia: you need to use <label>s
[11:20:27] <adavia> shoky: you are right
[11:21:56] <shoky> adavia: example http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1729/
[11:22:19] <ilhami> shoky, nice job.
[11:22:54] <ilhami> but isn't this for ratings? shouldn't it highlight the ones preceding the one that you select?
[11:23:07] <ilhami> s/the ones/the stars
[11:24:23] <shoky> not like this, i guess :D  http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1730/
[11:24:40] <ilhami> hahaha
[11:25:00] <adavia> shoky: looks like its on the opposite way
[11:25:05] <ilhami> well it's a step closer :D
[11:27:22] <shoky> :S  http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1731/
[11:27:45] <shoky> adavia anyway just follow the examples you pasted here a day or two ago
[11:28:13] <ilhami> awesome.
[11:29:40] <adavia> yeah that worked great
[11:30:25] <shoky> well, it shows rating of 5 stars when nothing is checked yet
[11:32:48] <adavia> Oh yes
[11:34:11] <shoky> hah but you can reverse the order using rtl  http://jsfiddle.net/JfGVE/1732/
[11:34:45] <ilhami> lol
[11:34:49] <shoky> though that'd need reversing their names too probably
[11:44:17] <projectui> ok. so stupid question. if you have a $objectList.each(function() {blah blah});... during iteration, you need to match the first object and put it back into place on itself, but it just disappears. any htoughts?
[11:55:34] <cjohnson> projectui: you are trying to modify an array of objects?
[11:55:58] <shoky> "put it back into place on itself" ..?
[11:56:07] <cjohnson> sounds like Array#map is called for
[11:56:29] <projectui> second stupid question.... if you save the "output" of a selector, is that a list or an array?
[11:56:45] <cjohnson> $('a') is a jquery collection, which is a special object that behaves like an array
[11:56:48] <shoky> the return value of $()  is a jquery object
[11:57:07] <projectui> ok. so heres my thing.
[11:58:46] <projectui> I have a top row of divs. they click 1 through 5. if they click 1, then 2-5 are expanded down on to a second row, and so on for 3-5. so if all are expanded you have 6 "button" rows. what I need to do, is if they click the button to collapse them all, I need to take the top row, and for each of the 2-5 placeholder buttons that are "hidden" pull those expanded buttons fromt he other rows back up to the first row.
[11:59:26] <projectui> the problem is, I need to select all 6 buttons. 1-5, and when I try to move button one back to the first row where it already exists, then it just poofs from existance.
[11:59:34] <shoky> that's.. not how you get help here ;p
[12:00:00] <projectui> lol you sick person. i like you lol
[12:00:09] <cjohnson> you can move elements around the page with .append(). and I would give those buttons a common class so you can easily keep re-selecting them all no matter where they are at
[12:00:58] <projectui> I've done that. they are all called primeClone. so do I just need to append them all and remove all the ones that are not primeClone?
[12:01:40] <cjohnson> you would simply do: $('.primeClone').append($('.first-row'));
[12:01:44] <cjohnson> and then clear all the other rows
[12:02:07] <projectui> if my fingers weren't typing so much I would slap myself lol
[12:02:29] <cjohnson> sorry that should be appendTo
[12:02:39] <cjohnson> or $('.first-row').append($('.primeClone'))
[12:02:40] <projectui> right. If igured that
[12:02:40] <cjohnson> same diff
[12:03:00] <projectui> 'aight. I appreciate that. see? this new resource is already helping me out.
[12:05:03] <ilhami> https://dpaste.de/pef2 what am I doing wrong? when I put the id directly in the url string it works fine
[12:05:45] <cjohnson> what works fine?
[12:05:59] <cjohnson> what's happening and what do you expect to happen?
[12:06:37] <ilhami> lol... when the url is like this: /api/categories/1 I get the expected result.
[12:06:40] <projectui> I don't know if data is considered a parameter rather than a package
[12:06:44] <ilhami> it's calling the right endpoint
[12:07:39] <ilhami> but when it's like in the snippet I pasted it doesn't append that id in the API call
[12:10:11] <projectui> the end point seems to be using the 1 as a "query string" value versus actual data to process inside the endpoint
[12:12:26] <ilhami> I will find a solution. :P
[12:16:39] <cjohnson> ilhami: why would you assume that the code you pasted would magically transform the url like that?
[12:17:02] <cjohnson> if you need to request a specific url, then you should be constructing that specific url and requesting it
[12:24:33] <ilhami> cjohnson, :)
[13:07:58] <projectui> so.... I assume this channel is ok for all skill ranges in jquery?
[13:08:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:08:30] <projectui> cool. now I don't feel so bad asking dumba** questions :-D
[13:10:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:11:46] <nix-bpi> I've not used irc in years. so you SHOULD or should NOT accept random DCC requests from strangers? Lol
[13:11:59] <robertmaxrees> err, i wouldn't.
[13:12:39] <nix-bpi> i'm just teasing. I know better. I had it happen one time and I learned to NOT do it again after I formatted my computer that night. lol
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:14:13] <nix-bpi> any of you guys in PA?
[13:17:36] <robertmaxrees> *people, and i'm sure some folks may be.
[13:17:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:24:47] <nix-bpi> sorry... any current channel visitors operating out of PA?
[13:24:56] <MikeD_> i am
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:25:10] <nix-bpi> MikeD: you PA?
[13:25:14] <MikeD_> yes
[13:25:27] <nix-bpi> what general area?
[13:25:33] <nix-bpi> <-- harrisburg
[13:25:35] <cjohnson> the PA area
[13:25:51] <MikeD_> king of prussia, midway between harrisburg and philthydelphia
[13:26:18] <nix-bpi> oh I know it well... there's a tilted kilt there lol
[13:26:43] <nix-bpi> well... not WELL.... my friend lives there and I pass through it on the way to philly via the turnpike
[13:26:59] <MikeD_> it's good to know landmarks :P
[13:27:19] <nix-bpi> yes... especially if you are thirsty and need visual entertainment
[13:48:50] <nix-bpi> ok. so another question for anyone...
[13:49:33] <nix-bpi> if you have a $objectList and you want to pull only those that are in $headerA of $containingDiv
[13:50:31] <nix-bpi> right now I'm doing $newlist = $('.blocks.original:not(.expanded)', $containingDiv);
[13:50:59] <nix-bpi> I have 2 rows $headerA and $headerB. I only want header A's objects to go into newlist
[13:51:39] <MikeD_> there's no way I can understand that... you'll need a jsfiddle example i think
[13:51:52] <nix-bpi> ok
[13:58:11] <nix-bpi> this is the quickest "mockup" that I could come up with
[13:58:11] <nix-bpi> https://jsfiddle.net/1vj79df7/
[14:09:01] <cjohnson> I think .filter accepts another jquery collection
[14:09:03] <cjohnson> could be wrong
[14:09:53] <nix-bpi> can you use filter on a collection of data- attributes?
[14:10:32] <cjohnson> I'm talking about filtering elements themselves
[14:10:45] <nix-bpi> say filter by '[data-rowid="' + $(this).data('id') + '"]);
[14:11:21] <nix-bpi> right. I want to filter out all the divs in the first row from the multi-row collection
[14:11:31] <nix-bpi> without hopefully using nested eaches
[14:12:05] <cjohnson> what do you mean
[14:12:09] <cjohnson> can you clarify in your example
[14:12:13] <cjohnson> which elements are you trying to select
[14:13:05] <nix-bpi> were you able to open my fiddle?
[14:13:53] <cjohnson> yes
[14:14:00] <cjohnson> but it's not obvious what elements you want to select
[14:14:04] <cjohnson> can you clarify which ones
[14:14:26] <plamb> is there a json viewer that allows you to save and paste a URL
[14:15:18] <nix-bpi> right.  I'm looking for all the items in the headerA row of the object list to enter the newList
[14:15:39] <cjohnson> all the items = all the divs?
[14:15:44] <nix-bpi> yups
[14:16:10] <cjohnson> var newList = $objectList.filter('.headerA').find('div')
[14:16:38] <cjohnson> that reduces $objectList to only those items with class headerA, and then once it has headerA it finds all divs inside it
[14:17:27] <nix-bpi> would it be possible to do a $objectList.filter($headerA).find('div') if we've already got the header row in a selected jquery object?
[14:17:48] <nix-bpi> nevermind. I will take yours and make it work.
[14:19:06] <cjohnson> yes that works too
[14:19:19] <cjohnson> filter accepts either a selector to match elements, or a jquery collection of elements
[14:19:53] <cjohnson> $('a.bar').filter($('a.foo'))  will first find all <a class="bar"> and then filters down to only those that are <a class="bar foo">
[14:19:58] <nix-bpi> jquery is like playdo... you can just make that stuff do anything
[14:20:09] <cjohnson> yeah. it's good and it's bad :P
[14:20:22] <cjohnson> inconsistent API is a nightmare in many cases but I do like this use of it
[14:21:00] <nix-bpi> ok. question. if you want to select by all of the data-id's in the collection of child divs in the header...? dum dum dummmmmmmm
[14:21:29] <cjohnson> "select by all of the data-ids" meaning what
[14:22:03] <nix-bpi> if each of the boxes boxa boxb and c had data id's as attributes
[14:22:05] <cjohnson> you want an array of the data-id attributes from each of your now-filtered set of objects?
[14:22:13] <cjohnson> or you only want elements that have a data-id
[14:23:36] <nix-bpi> I only want the items that have data id's matching those in the header a
[14:23:54] <cjohnson> .filter('[data-id=" + whateverId + "]')
[14:24:00] <cjohnson> and you can use .data('id') on an element to read it
[14:24:21] <nix-bpi> right but how do you read .data('id') from a collection?
[14:24:32] <nix-bpi> read all the data.('id')'s*
[14:24:42] <cjohnson> oh you want to read them all and tehn match any of the read ones
[14:25:01] <nix-bpi> pre-xactly!
[14:25:02] <cjohnson> you would have to use map for that to get the list, and then I would use a callback filter instead of building a big selecetor
[14:25:19] * nix-bpi is officially lost lol
[14:25:33] <cjohnson> var ids = $items.map(function() { return $(this).data('id'); });
[14:25:40] <cjohnson> now you have a list of IDs, next you want to filter by that list
[14:25:52] <nix-bpi> well s**t
[14:26:20] <cjohnson> .filter(function() { return matchIds.indexOf( $(this).data('id') ) > -1; })
[14:26:50] <cjohnson> given an array of matchIds (from the map example) this will filter only elements whose data-id is found in that array
[14:43:42] <MikeD_> $.ajax( .. ).done( .. ).fail( function( xhr, err ){ /* why doesn't this run? */ } )  <-- this is syntactically correct, yeah?
[14:43:51] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:51:55] <MikeD_> is there any reason why the ajax promise .fail() would not execute even though the requested url  does not exist?
[14:52:13] <MikeD_> or is that not a fail-inducing situation?
[15:04:19] <MikeD_> anyone?
[15:05:34] <cjohnson> probablay not a fail-inducing situation
[15:05:41] <cjohnson> a 404 is still a complete request
[15:06:00] <MikeD_> it's not firing a .done() on this url either
[15:06:36] <cjohnson> Personally I find the jquery deferred + ajax API to be confusing, I just wrap it in Promise.resolve() and use Promise API
[15:06:43] <cjohnson> or better still, just use fetch(), there's no reason to use $.ajax
[15:07:04] <MikeD_> does that work properly in ie10?
[15:07:36] <cjohnson> with a polyfill it works properly everywhere
[15:15:20] <ExeciN> Clicking subjects should make topics appear but they aren't appearing. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gLjmqR?editors=1011 what am I doing wrong?
[15:17:57] <robertmaxrees> loading jq and bs in the right order first would help.
[15:23:32] <robertmaxrees> easy
[15:23:45] <robertmaxrees> selectedSubject and .data("subject-id") don't match :)
[15:24:19] <ExeciN> oh
[15:24:53] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:25:12] <robertmaxrees> also: test.each(function() {
[15:25:28] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each(somejQueryThing, function() {});
[15:25:32] <robertmaxrees> use it the other way.
[16:26:49] <nix-bpi> wb shoky
[16:29:58] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[16:36:37] <shoky> thx
[16:38:59] <nix-bpi> so is there an idle timer on this? so like if I set me to away for the night, will it kick me before I get back to my computer in the morning?
[16:39:09] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:40:17] <nix-bpi> ok keww....
[16:40:24] <robertmaxrees> why do that though?
[16:40:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:41:11] <robertmaxrees> there are full logs at irc.jquery.com
[16:41:22] <nix-bpi> I was unaware of this.
[16:41:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> not like the channel desc says at much ;)
[16:49:47] <codecutter> why is this not working? replace - or + if either exists foo.replace('-|+','')
[16:50:09] <robertmaxrees> because you're passing the literal string '-|+'
[16:50:13] <robertmaxrees> you want a regular expression.
[16:50:45] <codecutter> go on..
[16:51:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:51:26] <codecutter> regex
[16:51:40] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[16:54:02] <cjohnson> regex objects have first class support in JS, they don't have to be wrapped in strings
[16:54:36] <codecutter> foo..replace('/-|+/g','')
[16:54:48] <cjohnson> DON'T have to be wrapped in strings
[16:56:15] <codecutter> invalid replace(/-|+/g,'')
[16:56:36] <snover> you really need to read up on regular expression syntax
[16:56:44] <snover> + means something special in regular expressions
[16:56:51] <codecutter> ticker-detail-ui.js:53 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /-|+/: Nothing to repeat(…)
[16:57:17] <snover> please actually read the entire page that robertmaxrees linked you to
[16:57:38] <codecutter> ah
[16:57:50] <codecutter> + has to be escaped
[16:58:13] <cjohnson> also I'm not sure but you might need to wrap | in parens
[16:58:28] <snover> nope
[16:58:30] <cjohnson> Or better yet just use [+-]
[16:58:33] <snover> yep
[16:58:34] <cjohnson> no escape needed for that
[17:03:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:09:18] <nix-bpi> ok guys... thanks for the help. I'll converse with you after the weekend and I've purged all technical stress from my body this weekend only to load it back up for next week.
[17:09:27] <nix-bpi> thanks again.
[17:09:28] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:13:45] <roadrunneratwast> hi all.  i am rewriting some code
[17:13:45] <roadrunneratwast> the original is:  the original code was                     jQuery('#scheduled-alert-modal .modal-body > :first-child')
[17:13:56] <roadrunneratwast> now i have aliased jQuery ('#scheduled-alert-modal') to $modal_body
[17:14:06] <roadrunneratwast> so can i do $modal_body.find(' > :first-child')
[17:14:28] <robertmaxrees> are you asking permission?
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused.
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:14:34] <roadrunneratwast> haha
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> also, you're missing .modal-body
[17:14:52] <roadrunneratwast> right sorry that was in the aliasing
[17:14:59] <roadrunneratwast> i copied my code wrong
[17:15:01] <robertmaxrees> "aliasing" haha.
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> so what are you asking?
[17:15:19] <roadrunneratwast> find(' > :first-child')
[17:15:25] <roadrunneratwast> is that a valid subselector
[17:15:36] <roadrunneratwast> if i have the modal-body selector right
[17:15:36] <robertmaxrees> it's a valid selector.
[17:15:41] <roadrunneratwast> cool
[17:15:41] <robertmaxrees> are you not getting what you're looking for?
[17:15:55] <robertmaxrees> "valid" and "does what i expec" are two different ideas fwiw,.
[17:16:07] <roadrunneratwast> to be honest, this code is a goddam mess.  i am not even sure what it is supposed to do in the first place
[17:16:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:16:37] <robertmaxrees> you could test the idea.
[17:16:41] <robertmaxrees> and to an .is() to compare.
[17:16:52] <roadrunneratwast> it's that i am doing a code rewrite
[17:17:03] <roadrunneratwast> but i don't actually understand all the functionality
[17:17:15] <roadrunneratwast> and the mess the previous guy left is horrific
[17:17:26] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:17:29] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[17:17:34] <roadrunneratwast> so yeah
[17:17:43] <robertmaxrees> you can compare the two objects using .is()
[17:17:45] <roadrunneratwast> i just was wondering if the selector was valid
[17:17:45] <robertmaxrees> that's my point.
[17:17:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:17:54] <robertmaxrees> "valid" is the wrong question, but OK.
[17:51:30] <Birliban> TotallyNotKim: thank you. what do you mean with actual logic instead of delay() ? ;-)
[18:47:31] <arc_> i'm just checking, i'm pretty sure this is actual nonsense
[18:47:35] <arc_> "Google told us in May that it would eventually block Adobe Flash Player content on Chrome. And today, the company is making good on its promise. Google is slowly rolling HTML5 out to users over the next couple of months, starting with one percent of users on the current version of Chrome. Everyone should have an updated Chrome by February, when the most recent beta version goes stable."
[18:48:29] <arc_> ok, yeah. the actual chrome dev team post says they're rolling out "HTML5 By Default"
[19:10:26] <sharax> hi friends
[19:12:23] <sharax> how to get url content on jquery and filter by div element?!
