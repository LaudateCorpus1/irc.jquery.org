[01:08:23] <bsdnoob> so how I can remove state of checkbox when backbutton is pressed.
[01:08:23] <bsdnoob> ?
[01:10:32] <pavonia> Run a JS script that unchecks all?
[01:10:57] <bsdnoob> pavonia, I tried this inside ready() , $('input:checkbox').prop('checked', false);
[01:10:57] <bsdnoob> but this does not seem to work at all.
[01:11:43] <pavonia> "input:checkbox" is wrong, try "input[type='checkbox']"
[01:12:50] <bsdnoob> pavonia, I tried this
[01:12:58] <bsdnoob> $('input[type=checkbox]').prop('checked', false);
[01:13:04] <bsdnoob> but still same
[01:16:30] <pavonia> bsdnoob: Try adding $(window).unload(function () {});
[01:18:47] <bsdnoob> pavonia, okay works now. Thanks
[01:20:25] <pavonia> The reason seems to be that browsers cache the page and only use the chached version when coming back via the back button. Setting an unload action invalidates this cache
[01:50:35] <snover> bsdnoob, pavonia: bfcache does not need to be disabled by adding an unload event in order to make changes when someone navigates to a page through the back/forward button. if you want to know when a user navigates in this way so you can reset things on the page, listen for the pageshow event on window.
[10:01:38] <blastis> ok who needs some fixin' help?
[10:41:52] <Sagar> how to make a rotatable div using javascript touches events?
[11:37:53] <simbalion`> I want to set a different banner graphic on every page, and have it change based on screen width, like example_1920.jpg example_1080.jpg and so on. I know I can do this with a thousand media queries but is there a way to do it with js or jquery that'd reduce the amount of code?
[12:11:16] <simbalion`> hrm, guess I'll just use media queries, that's probably best anyway
[13:38:22] <bluj> hi there. i have no idea if this is really the channel for this, i'm not much of a web developer. i'm putting together a benchmark test suite which spits out a webpage index.html with some graphs and i also have several plain test log files attached. i'm looking for some plugin i can use to perhaps nicely display any log files i've captured?
[13:40:23] <Sayona> Hi, can anyone help me to fix subtotal and total ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/24824911/

[15:01:23] <hhee> did a lot of stackoverflow (about one day researching) but nothing
[15:22:00] <hhee> guys, where can i view doc for 2 version/
[15:22:03] <hhee> ?
[15:42:06] <shoky> hhee: show your code and what you're seeing in devtools for the request. are you trying to send json to the server or receive json from it? or both
[15:43:49] <hhee> shoky, wait a sec
[15:49:39] <hhee> shoky, https://jsfiddle.net/6403udym/  and php https://pastebin.com/fmVTHHxD
[15:49:43] <hhee> smth like that
[15:50:00] <hhee> url itself http://tenderpoisk.xyz/
[15:50:09] <hhee> try first item
[15:50:59] <shoky> hhee: is it the same origin?
[15:51:19] <shoky> oh you pasted the url
[15:52:12] <hhee> there is. i can give you ssh to server, if it need. i tried to do it long time
[15:52:21] <hhee> same origin
[15:52:40] <shoky> hhee: you're not preventing the default click action, it's just behaving as a link
[15:53:08] <hhee> how can i do it? preventdefault?
[15:53:12] <shoky> yep
[15:53:30] <shoky> .click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ... })
[15:53:58] <hhee> shoky, got it. i'll try
[15:54:02] <hhee> wait a sec
[15:56:07] <hhee> shoky, got another error - SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data - but it's no problem, you help me solve main problem! thanks a lot!
[15:56:38] <shoky> hhee: dataType: 'json'   already parses the json for you
[15:57:44] <hhee> shoky, got it thanks again. btw can you recommend good book about jquery?
[15:58:19] <shoky> no. books suck usually :) and they get outdated fast
[15:59:45] <hhee> shoky, i tried to read official docs. but seems like docs about new version of jquery. with .done .fail .always
[16:00:56] <shoky> hhee: those aren't new.. you should not be using any jquery version that doesn't have those :p
[16:01:31] <shoky> and you can mix reading official docs with official guides:  http://learn.jquery.com/
[16:01:44] <hhee> shoky, got it:) i jsut read "Deprecation Notice: The jqXHR.success(), jqXHR.error(), and jqXHR.complete() callbacks are removed as of jQuery 3.0. You can use jqXHR.done(), jqXHR.fail(), and jqXHR.always() instead."
[16:02:07] <hhee> shoky, thx! :)
[16:02:08] <shoky> hhee:  so?  use the new ones
[16:02:31] <shoky> newer*
[16:02:49] <hhee> shoky, as i know they dont support old browsers?
[16:03:26] <shoky> hhee: i mean use the new XHR methods,  not new jquery.  use the newest jquery that supports the browsers you need
[16:03:46] <hhee> and i already write smth with old version. now i have to do this task using this version, :) newer versions it's for newer task :)
[16:04:00] <hhee> shoky, got it
[16:04:06] <shoky> you don't want to be reading old documentation/guides, in any case.
[16:04:47] <hhee> .done .fail and so on actually works in 2 version of jquery/
[16:04:48] <hhee> ?
[16:04:57] <shoky> sure
[16:05:06] <hhee> shoky, oh thx again
[16:05:22] <shoky> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/  version added: 1.5
[16:05:26] <hhee> i think it doesnt't
[16:05:30] <shoky> it does.
[16:05:34] <hhee> got it
[16:06:02] <hhee> shoky, it first thing im doing using jquery :)
[16:06:19] <shoky> you're doing great, then ;]
