[07:21:09] <arash> Hello, Iâ€™m using phpstorm IDE for programming. I'm new in js and jquery but i know php, I want to practice and write some code in jquery, is there any editor to suggest me some method when coding ?
[07:38:13] <Robdgreat> arash: first Google result for "phpstorm" jquery autocomplete:
[07:38:14] <Robdgreat> You can enable jQuery code completion by adding it as a global library in Webstorm and phpStorm
[07:38:25] <Robdgreat> hope this helps
[07:46:18] <arash> Robdgreat: thank you. helped a lot. but the problem is when i press the download button in libraries it wont work...it cannot download the list...
[08:05:37] <Robdgreat> arash: you might need to download it manually. I've never had that issue
[09:43:12] <arash> I want to add a jquery library to phpstorm for auto complete feature, but it cannot download automatically, is there any way to download and import this manually ? What do I need to download in order to make it work ?
[13:07:39] <dimi1947> I know that HTML loads first and then code inside document ready runs...when the doc is ready I have set a popup in display none...I expected the popup shown momentarily(since HTML loads first) but it does not...the code inside has an immediate effect...I dont understand)
[13:08:02] <dimi1947> please someone explain it
[13:08:07] <Gh0st_Preacher> dimi1947 is there a css hide or something?
[13:08:43] <robertmaxrees> like, there could be a half dozen reasons why that would happen - document ready happens when the document is ready, which is pretty fast.

[13:09:57] <dimi1947> Gh0st_Preacher:I just use hide()
[13:10:50] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:yes this is want I describe
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 it really is that it's so fast you aren't seeing the content.
[13:12:37] <dimi1947> unbelievable...
[13:12:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> computers are fast :shrug:
[13:20:25] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 also: keep in mind there's a distinction between the DOM and CSSOM and when those run.  you can go read up on the lifecycle on the internet :)
[13:28:17] <dimi1947> ok
[14:33:15] <spid3rm0n> hello?
[14:33:44] <robertmaxrees> there are people here...
[14:44:18] <spid3rm0n> oh ok
[14:44:32] <spid3rm0n> i was just wondering if there was any different between a class and an object?
[14:45:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a great question for ##javascript :)
[14:46:24] <spid3rm0n> isnt jquery javascript?
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> it is!  but your question is unrelated to jquery :)
[14:47:29] <spid3rm0n> ok let me ask another q. how do you write a class in jquery?
[14:47:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't.  jquery is a DOM abstraction library.  it doesn't extend or change the language.
[15:11:14] <spid3rm0n> so should i use jquery or react?
[15:11:33] <spid3rm0n> i think they are doing the same thing but react is newer tech
[16:46:43] <jak2000> how to round to 5 low/minor sample:       1089.98 = 1085.00   1099.05= 1095  1071.87  =1070  any idea?
[16:52:40] <jak2000> fixed
