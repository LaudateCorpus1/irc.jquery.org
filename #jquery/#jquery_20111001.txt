[00:04:42] <solepixel> i have a click event bound to a link and I need to erase that event and create a new event, i've tried everything from unbinding, to preventDefault to stopPropagation and I cannot get rid of the previous click event. What am I doing wrong?
[00:06:10] <solepixel> does it matter if my selectors are different?
[00:08:21] <whackyMan> solepixel: when do you unbind the event?
[00:08:34] <solepixel> just before I rebind it to something else
[00:08:40] <solepixel> i'm trying a namespace route now
[00:09:31] <whackyMan> solepxel: what makes you think its not working?
[00:09:42] <solepixel> i'm getting 2 confirm boxes
[00:09:47] <solepixel> using namespaces worked! yay
[00:09:54] <solepixel> $delete_links.unbind('click.deleteaction');
[00:10:00] <solepixel> $delete_links.click(function(e){                 if(!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this?')){                     return false;                }
[00:10:11] <solepixel> that will remove the default deleteaction click event
[00:10:15] <solepixel> then add a new one :)
[00:10:21] <solepixel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209029/best-way-to-remove-an-event-handler-in-jquery
[00:10:44] <solepixel> learn something new everyday! :)
[00:10:55] <whackyMan> wheres the namespace part in that?
[00:11:05] <solepixel> well, i didn't bother with a namespace on the 2nd one
[00:11:13] <solepixel> $('input[name="delete"],.delete').bind('click.deleteaction',function(e){
[00:11:16] <solepixel> that's the first one
[00:12:02] <whackyMan> no namespace in that either...
[00:12:14] <solepixel> .bind('click.deleteaction',
[00:12:18] <solepixel> that's not a namespace?
[00:13:05] <whackyMan> nope
[00:13:32] <solepixel> well
[00:13:33] <solepixel> it works
[00:14:04] <whackyMan> yeah as long it works i suppose :)
[00:14:14] <solepixel> http://docs.jquery.com/Namespaced_Events
[00:14:17] <solepixel> it's in the docs
[00:14:23] <solepixel> $('.class').bind('click.namespace', function(){});  $('.class').trigger('click.namespace'); $('.class').unbind('click.namespace');
[00:14:52] <whackyMan> show me deleteaction
[00:15:03] <solepixel> click.namespace
[00:15:10] <solepixel> you can make up any namespace you want
[00:15:23] <solepixel> i called mine deleteaction
[00:15:31] <whackyMan> you have deleteaction as your namespace
[00:15:35] <solepixel> yep
[00:15:42] <whackyMan> show me the deleteaction code
[00:16:11] <solepixel> http://pastebin.com/09PBrLG6
[00:16:54] <solepixel> The Solution: Namespaced Events  jQuery provides a concept called namespaced events: Simply add a classname to your event when you declare it. You can then reference that namespaced event both with unbind and trigger.
[00:17:24] <solepixel> not sure what you're not getting about this: http://screencast.com/t/uO3cRARTXa
[00:17:48] <whackyMan> solepixel: so you are using a namespace for $('input[name="delete"],.delete') correct?
[00:18:00] <solepixel> yep
[00:18:26] <solepixel> then, later removing that click by namespace, and adding a new click event
[00:18:26] <whackyMan> not sure why it wouldnt work without a namespace...
[00:18:37] <solepixel> me neither
[00:18:44] <solepixel> which is why i'm in here asking questions
[00:19:01] <whackyMan> sure
[00:19:18] <whackyMan> can you put in it a jsfiddle?
[00:19:32] <whackyMan> i reckon i can get it to work without namespace.
[00:20:28] <whackyMan> solepixel: ?
[00:20:39] <solepixel> well, one minute
[00:21:07] <whackyMan> solepixel: ok
[00:23:02] <solepixel> i never used jsfiddle
[00:23:05] <solepixel> i can't get it to work
[00:23:16] <solepixel> http://jsfiddle.net/YFD84/
[00:23:29] <whackyMan> ill show you
[00:25:08] <solepixel> ah
[00:25:10] <solepixel> there we go
[00:25:13] <solepixel> i was missing a })
[00:25:22] <solepixel> http://jsfiddle.net/YFD84/3/
[00:25:40] <solepixel> so, if you comment out this line: $delete_links.unbind('click.deleteaction');
[00:25:43] <whackyMan> ok
[00:25:45] <solepixel> you get 2 confirm boxes on the 2nd delete link
[00:27:31] <whackyMan> solepixel: usually you would simple have two different classes for your problem.
[00:27:58] <solepixel> that is another way of doing it yes
[00:28:00] <solepixel> see
[00:28:05] <solepixel> my css is setup
[00:28:12] <solepixel> <a class="ico delete">
[00:28:14] <solepixel> so
[00:28:18] <solepixel> i need the delete class for css
[00:28:35] <solepixel> turns my link into a trash can
[00:28:54] <solepixel> so having 2 classes for the same style can get redundant
[00:28:59] <solepixel> i like this solution better
[00:29:23] <solepixel> because the larger the application gets, the more need i'll have to customize the delete action
[00:29:27] <solepixel> so the more classes I would need
[00:29:37] <solepixel> this solution seems the most logical
[00:35:09] <whackyMan> solepixel: http://jsfiddle.net/YFD84/9/
[00:35:31] <whackyMan> solepixel: the problem was the way you were selecting things.
[00:35:42] <solepixel> there is no global id/class surrounding all my delete links
[00:35:58] <solepixel> my delete links are in various places in my application
[00:36:06] <solepixel> but for the most part, they all do the same thing
[00:36:33] <solepixel> are you against using namespaces?
[00:36:45] <whackyMan> solepixel: do you understand what i did?
[00:36:49] <solepixel> yeah
[00:36:55] <solepixel> you wrapped my link in a class
[00:36:58] <solepixel> not going to work in my case
[00:37:50] <solepixel> i have .delete links in about 50 places in this application
[00:37:57] <solepixel> wrapping them in a common selector is unrealistic
[00:38:19] <whackyMan> solepixel: http://jsfiddle.net/YFD84/10/
[00:38:23] <whackyMan> check that out
[00:38:52] <solepixel> i have .delete links in about 50 places in this application. Adding an additional class to all of them is unrealistic
[00:39:11] <whackyMan> check out http://jsfiddle.net/YFD84/10/ <-- no wrapping
[00:39:26] <solepixel> i have .delete links in about 50 places in this application. Adding an additional class to all of them is unrealistic
[00:39:48] <whackyMan> lol
[00:40:35] <whackyMan> solepixel: i give up :)
[00:40:45] <solepixel> i don't even understand why you're trying
[00:40:49] <solepixel> i told you i had it figured out
[00:44:43] <whackyMan> solepixel: your HTML is flawed, so its not a clean way of doing it but *shrug*.
[00:45:06] <solepixel> ok
[00:46:15] <whackyMan> solepixel: but i have learnt something new today as well :)
[00:47:02] <brandonmerritt> anybody have a minute to take a look at some jsfiddle?
[00:47:19] <brandonmerritt> i'm working on a constructor that populates fields based on select options
[00:47:30] <brandonmerritt> but i can't get it to work
[00:47:57] <brandonmerritt> works great if i call a variable directly
[00:48:20] <brandonmerritt> but if i create a new variable from an attribute and call that it doesn't budge
[00:48:26] <brandonmerritt> http://jsfiddle.net/brandonmerritt/HSnwa/
[00:50:14] <nickadeemus2002> hi, did you run jslint on your code?
[00:50:21] <nickadeemus2002> it's showing an error
[00:57:23] <nickadeemus2002> i don't see how the code will work based on your use of objects
[00:58:12] <brandonmerritt> can you elaborate?
[00:58:57] <nickadeemus2002> sure
[00:59:00] <nickadeemus2002> this line here:
[00:59:01] <nickadeemus2002> var a_1_1597807 = new agent("1_1597807","nrabern@vitamintalent.com","23");
[00:59:08] <nickadeemus2002> references an object
[01:00:32] <brandonmerritt> creates a new agent object
[01:00:40] <nickadeemus2002> however, agent is a function
[01:01:11] <brandonmerritt> well it's a constructor function
[01:02:17] <brandonmerritt> so it's  taking the contents of the vars and creating a new object
[01:02:25] <brandonmerritt> works great if you only have one var
[01:02:26] <dark_echo> hi
[01:03:05] <dark_echo> im developing a chrome extension and need to show a dialog at somewhere in the loaded page and using jquery ui' s model dialog for this
[01:03:42] <brandonmerritt> but maybe i'm using a bad design pattern
[01:03:53] <dark_echo> but the dialog show different at everypage. i think the loaded pages css is affecting the model dialog' css
[01:04:19] <dark_echo> how can i prevent this and make the dialog show same at every page
[01:04:23] <dark_echo> ???
[01:04:39] <brandonmerritt> isolate the classes of your modal
[01:04:55] <brandonmerritt> .mymodal h1 {}
[01:05:08] <brandonmerritt> .mymodal p{}
[01:05:09] <brandonmerritt> etc
[01:05:10] <nickadeemus2002> right, it's a constructor
[01:06:04] <brandonmerritt> nickadeemus2002: i thought i'd be clever and try something from here http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[01:06:20] <brandonmerritt> but to be honest, with this many vars, i'm not sure what else to try
[01:06:27] <brandonmerritt> been wracking my brain for hours
[01:06:30] <nickadeemus2002> sure
[01:06:42] <nickadeemus2002> well, my general impression is that the change event
[01:07:01] <nickadeemus2002> will not invoke the object creation/conteructor
[01:07:16] <nickadeemus2002> ..unless i'm missing a } somewhere ; )
[01:07:35] <nickadeemus2002> one sec
[01:07:45] <nickadeemus2002> i'm pulling this down to run it locally
[01:12:56] <brandonmerritt> i don't think it's working much at all now... before i had it where you could at least use one of the named vars
[01:12:58] <brandonmerritt> like
[01:13:04] <brandonmerritt> a_1_1606694.update();
[01:13:08] <brandonmerritt> but even that's broke now
[01:14:24] <nickadeemus2002> yeah
[01:14:26] <nickadeemus2002> give me a sec
[01:14:36] <nickadeemus2002> i'm bringing it down now
[01:14:43] <nickadeemus2002> interesting issue
[01:18:21] <brandonmerritt> so for more fun
[01:18:27] <brandonmerritt> take it out of the change
[01:18:31] <brandonmerritt> and try
[01:18:57] <brandonmerritt> selecting something at randome (boston)
[01:19:02] <brandonmerritt> var sel = $('select option:selected').val();
[01:19:03] <brandonmerritt> sel
[01:19:05] <brandonmerritt> nothing works
[01:19:07] <brandonmerritt> but
[01:19:15] <brandonmerritt> a_1_1606694
[01:19:17] <brandonmerritt> that will
[01:19:18] <brandonmerritt> lame!
[01:19:37] <brandonmerritt> it's like it doesn't like the String
[01:33:29] <nickadeemus2002> hey
[01:33:37] <nickadeemus2002> i ran this code locally
[01:33:46] <nickadeemus2002> and firebug is confused with the "sel" object
[01:34:23] <nickadeemus2002> so this is what i was describing earlier about the use of objects
[01:34:27] <nickadeemus2002> --
[01:34:32] <brandonmerritt> heh yep it doesn't think it's a function
[01:34:58] <nickadeemus2002> yes, because you are using "update" with dot notation
[01:35:07] <nickadeemus2002> referencing an object
[01:35:11] <nickadeemus2002> however,
[01:35:21] <nickadeemus2002> your code references the String object
[01:35:28] <nickadeemus2002> and then the jquery object as well
[01:35:41] <nickadeemus2002> with this line here:
[01:35:42] <nickadeemus2002>   var sel = String($('select option:selected').attr('value'));
[01:36:00] <brandonmerritt> i thought i ripped out the string
[01:36:01] <brandonmerritt> sorry
[01:36:05] <nickadeemus2002> also, there is no reference to the "agent" object
[01:36:18] <nickadeemus2002> because when you use the jquery selector for a variable
[01:36:27] <nickadeemus2002> you are referencing jquery
[01:36:32] <nickadeemus2002> not the agent object
[01:36:59] <nickadeemus2002> so the browser can't find the "update" object method
[01:38:11] <nickadeemus2002> hmm
[01:38:16] <brandonmerritt> var sel = $('select option:selected').attr('value');
[01:38:16] <brandonmerritt> sel.update();
[01:38:28] <nickadeemus2002> right, but that still references jquery object
[01:38:31] <nickadeemus2002> not the "agent" object
[01:38:59] <brandonmerritt> hmm
[01:39:16] <brandonmerritt> i mean that's the trick
[01:39:24] <brandonmerritt> i need a way of calling named variables
[01:39:28] <nickadeemus2002> sure
[01:39:35] <brandonmerritt> cuase that seems to work
[01:39:40] <nickadeemus2002> what is your pattern here?
[01:39:48] <nickadeemus2002> are you familiar with factory pattern?
[01:40:14] <nickadeemus2002> what you could do is create a new object in the change event function
[01:40:32] <nickadeemus2002> that references the agent object
[01:40:55] <brandonmerritt> this is a basic constructor
[01:40:57] <nickadeemus2002> and take out all the "new agent" objects from inside of the change event
[01:41:01] <nickadeemus2002> sure
[01:41:17] <nickadeemus2002> but how does the code know which agent object to create?
[01:41:31] <brandonmerritt> exactly
[01:41:42] <brandonmerritt> that's what i was trying to do with the sel.update()
[01:41:51] <nickadeemus2002> let me try something
[01:42:06] <brandonmerritt> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[01:42:16] <brandonmerritt> scroll down to factory
[01:42:21] <brandonmerritt> i don't really see a huge diff
[01:45:06] <brandonmerritt> i i remember what i was thinking about the factory, based on this example, i have no idea how to create the new object
[01:47:09] <nickadeemus2002> sure, no worries
[01:47:13] <nickadeemus2002> here's my thinking..
[01:47:26] <nickadeemus2002> take the agent object out of the change event function
[01:48:01] <nickadeemus2002> then we have to find a way to eliminate the use of all the "new agent" statements
[01:48:25] <nickadeemus2002> so we are not creating all those objects with each change event
[01:49:00] <nickadeemus2002> then find an efficient way to create an object inside of the change event
[01:49:10] <nickadeemus2002> that references the agent object
[01:50:37] <brandonmerritt> so i uploaded the factory design
[01:50:58] <brandonmerritt> but i have no idea how they work
[01:55:09] <nickadeemus2002> ok
[01:55:20] <nickadeemus2002> so here's where i need your input : )
[01:55:27] <brandonmerritt> sure
[01:55:35] <nickadeemus2002> when the option value comes into the change event
[01:55:43] <nickadeemus2002> we can use it's value
[01:55:56] <nickadeemus2002> as a token to create a single agent object
[01:56:18] <nickadeemus2002> and then we could assign that object to the var "sel" inside of the change event
[01:56:20] <brandonmerritt> ok
[01:56:50] <brandonmerritt> that makes sense, i'm having trouble visualizing it
[01:56:56] <nickadeemus2002> then you can use the sel.udpate method inside of the change event after the new agent object is created
[01:57:01] <nickadeemus2002> well here's the thing
[01:57:34] <nickadeemus2002> we have to decide where your code will need to define all the object vars
[01:57:40] <nickadeemus2002> so for example
[01:57:49] <nickadeemus2002> inside of the change event
[01:57:54] <nickadeemus2002> i would have something like
[01:58:20] <nickadeemus2002>     $('select').change(function(){
[01:58:21] <nickadeemus2002>       var selected_value = $('select option:selected').attr('value');
[01:58:58] <nickadeemus2002>       var sel = new agent(selected_value);
[01:59:12] <nickadeemus2002>       sel.update();
[01:59:17] <nickadeemus2002> --
[01:59:31] <nickadeemus2002> then inside of the agent object definition
[01:59:53] <nickadeemus2002> that is where you will need to use the "selected_value" value form your form
[02:00:17] <nickadeemus2002> to build a valid agent object
[02:00:36] <nickadeemus2002> by using another method that will
[02:00:56] <nickadeemus2002> define this type of data: "1_1597807","nrabern@vitamintalent.com","23"
[02:01:10] <nickadeemus2002> make sense?
[02:01:28] <brandonmerritt> yeah
[02:01:28] <nickadeemus2002> so basically, you make a single agent object
[02:01:48] <brandonmerritt> yep
[02:01:50] <brandonmerritt> makes sense
[02:01:52] <nickadeemus2002> and then make the object operate on itself to decide how to define all the agent property vars
[02:02:14] <nickadeemus2002> this way, the "sel" object in your change event
[02:02:22] <nickadeemus2002> will reference the agent object
[02:02:25] <nickadeemus2002> and not the jquery object
[02:02:26] <brandonmerritt> yeah
[02:02:26] <nickadeemus2002> --
[02:02:49] <nickadeemus2002> you only want to create an object once
[02:02:58] <nickadeemus2002> and use it as much as possible in this case
[02:03:07] <nickadeemus2002> rather than creating multiple objects
[02:03:11] <nickadeemus2002> --
[02:03:24] <nickadeemus2002> and this explains why the code worked when you used
[02:03:27] <nickadeemus2002> a var like
[02:03:37] <nickadeemus2002>  a_1_1597807
[02:04:00] <nickadeemus2002> because you were making several objects and manually defining which one to use
[02:04:09] <nickadeemus2002> when really, we needed to create a single agent object
[02:04:33] <nickadeemus2002> that is in itself defined conditionally
[02:04:42] <nickadeemus2002> using the form option value.
[02:04:49] <brandonmerritt> yeah makes total sense
[02:05:00] <brandonmerritt> i'm going to be at the jquery conference in the morning
[02:05:05] <nickadeemus2002> then we would be able to use the udpate method on that specific instance
[02:05:09] <nickadeemus2002> ok
[02:05:11] <brandonmerritt> so i'll tear everything down an start over
[02:05:18] <nickadeemus2002> that sounds like fun
[02:05:22] <brandonmerritt> lol
[02:05:26] <nickadeemus2002> well, you won't have to start over
[02:05:34] <brandonmerritt> i wanted to be done with this project so bad
[02:05:56] <nickadeemus2002> just make an object method that will make the decisions for you
[02:06:03] <nickadeemus2002> based on the passed value
[02:06:05] <nickadeemus2002> and you are done
[02:06:06] <nickadeemus2002> --
[02:06:28] <nickadeemus2002> it should take no more than 20 minutes or so
[02:06:28] <brandonmerritt> easy peasy right
[02:06:48] <brandonmerritt> oh man that's intimidating
[02:07:09] <brandonmerritt> i'm so new to the "non-designer" side of jquery
[02:07:12] <nickadeemus2002> ha! not really
[02:07:17] <nickadeemus2002> it's easy
[02:07:28] <nickadeemus2002> you'll get the hang of it
[02:07:40] <nickadeemus2002> and there might even be an easier way of doing this
[02:07:46] <nickadeemus2002> without a design pattern
[02:07:48] <nickadeemus2002> : )
[02:08:33] <brandonmerritt> yeah, that's sort of my feeling
[02:08:34] <brandonmerritt> lol
[02:08:50] <brandonmerritt> ok i'm going to get 3 hours of sleep before the conference
[02:08:53] <brandonmerritt> thanks for your help!
[02:08:54] <nickadeemus2002> ok
[02:08:57] <nickadeemus2002> take care
[02:36:32] <amirite> is it possible to conditionally force an iframe into a new window (i.e. child window split off top window)
[02:42:08] <inpho> i know this isnt really jquery, but do any of u guys see why this function is goofying up.. i can get it to hit the alert window but it seems the return isnt stopping the function. it does the lines below still

[06:51:04] <Darsain> why does this return -1? http://pastie.org/2622042
[06:53:00] <bnado> the returned wrap set is a 0 based array
[06:55:20] <bnado> index() returns the index not the index, not the object. use find()  or get() instead
[06:59:08] <bnado> not the object i mean
[07:00:12] <Darsain> I need index, which in an example should be 1. but it returns -1, as if the selector didn't find anything. or do I have a bad understanding of how index() function works?

[07:18:38] <Elephant> ' greg
[07:19:23] <in> hi ben
[07:19:28] <in> lets ask yoru question man
[07:19:35] <in> these guys are smart
[07:21:10] <ben1> Hey guys. I am trying to dynamically generate a get request, and am expecting to get some JSON back from an API. How might I do this?
[07:21:53] <ben1> $.getJSON("http://96.43.129.45/api/index.php",
[07:21:53] <ben1>   {
[07:21:53] <ben1>     method=getCallSignDetail,
[07:21:53] <ben1>     callSign="KD0OCT"
[07:21:54] <ben1>   },
[07:21:54] <ben1> Trying this. Failing.
[07:22:35] <Elephant> what does firebug/web inspecter say?
[07:23:11] <ben1> gimme a second. I didn't look.
[07:24:59] <FinalAngel> heya guys, does anyone of you know of a js library where I can load different ressources depending on the screen size. for example I'd like to load gallery.js on desktop but gallery_mobile.js on mobile. Would like to declare that within the javascript ie: load gallery.js if screen size is larger than xxx...
[07:25:29] <nickadeemus2002> ben1: i don't think your object is correct
[07:25:36] <nickadeemus2002> it's not set up as a name:value pair
[07:25:38] <Elephant> FinalAngel: that it something I would usually handle server-side, with the user-agent detection.
[07:26:04] <nickadeemus2002> {method:getCallSignDetail, callSign:KD0OCT
[07:26:06] <nickadeemus2002> }
[07:29:48] <nickadeemus2002> ben1: this example would probably work best for the "data" value..
[07:29:49] <nickadeemus2002> $.getJSON('ajax/test.json', function(data) {   var items = [];    $.each(data, function(key, val) {     items.push('<li id="' + key + '">' + val + '</li>');   });    $('<ul/>', {     'class': 'my-new-list',     html: items.join('')   }).appendTo('body'); });
[07:30:01] <nickadeemus2002> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[07:32:30] <FinalAngel> yeah that is correct Elephant, but I have a usecase here where I need to use it clientside
[07:33:03] <ben1> Appreciate the help guys. I've seen this while googling. I can get getJSON to work locally against a .json to give me the whole string. I don't understand however, how to tell that php what I want from it. I'm gonna hack away at it.
[07:34:09] <Elephant> So, I guess my next question is why are you detecting mobile interfaces via screen size?
[07:34:43] <Elephant> I suppose this is reasonable, but I think quite a few mobile users like to view the full site.
[07:35:27] <Elephant> But you could detect the screen size on load, and make an ajax call to load the appropriet js lib.
[07:46:50] <ben1> If you jsut want to detect mobile, instead of grabbing screen size, you can use this function. I am sure this is a shit solution. But it worked for me.
[07:55:53] <Elephant> I concur with ben1, I think it would probably be better to just detect via user_agent, ensuring that mobile users have a link to the main site if they want it.
[07:56:09] <Elephant> just a little note on the top "Hey, this is the mobile version, click here for the full".
[08:57:29] <Kamakazi> If I am dynamically adding rows each with three text input boxes
[08:57:38] <Kamakazi> is there anyway to set the tab indexes correctly?
[08:57:55] <Dave_Stein> as you're adding you know the index of like 0 1 2 3 in a loop
[08:58:00] <Dave_Stein> so you can use .attr to set tabindex accordingly

[09:49:45] <adtaylor> I am having some problems with live event not behaving in Chrome. In most browsers a click event seems to be fired before a blur, but in chrome OS X, the blur is firing first.

[10:22:12] <Paul_Linney> sk8ball: Slider Kit or jQuery Cycle are flexible enough to get what you want (probably)
[10:23:13] <sk8ball> paul, out of the two which would you reccommend
[10:23:43] <sk8ball> i keep finding ones that need all kinds of css editing and retardedness that is unnecessary
[10:25:00] <Paul_Linney> sk8ball: I've been more inclined to use SliderKit lately as Cycle sets lots of inline styles that make the cycle elements absolute and fixed widths/heights
[10:25:13] <Paul_Linney> Both are good though

[10:28:31] <mdunham918_> hello i have a question about ui sortable I'm trying to make a menu with multi-level ul li sortable via javascript. For example I have a main ul li which each li is single there are no sub ul's but I want to make those when you drag them have the ability to reorder just like sortable but i want them to be allowed to move li's under other li's and have it create a new ul for that item under the new li
[10:28:37] <mdunham918_> does that make sense?
[10:31:06] <mdunham918_> here is an example:  http://jsfiddle.net/hqqDt/1/
[10:31:23] <mdunham918_> I'm wanting to make it so they can move a top level li under another li
[10:31:39] <mdunham918_> for example move test two under test one
[10:33:05] <adtaylor> sorry to ask again but it was much quieter before. Does anyone know how I can negate the need for a setTimeout on this event based problem? http://jsfiddle.net/adtaylor/xZ3Xs/
[10:40:24] <mdunham918_> adtaylor: what are you trying to accomplish
[10:41:33] <mdunham918_> adtaylor: perhaps you need a return false; somewhere other than that you need to explain what your trying to do whats the expected behavior and what its doing wrong
[10:44:31] <adtaylor> mdunham918_: I am making a autocomplete plugin for our site. When the user blurs off the input or the autocomplete widget it removes the widget. However when the user clicks on one of the links in the widget  the blur event is fired before the click is processed. I'm not actually trying to do anything with the link, the alert was just for demo purpose.
[10:45:16] <mdunham918_> adtaylor: the alert didn't fire for me
[10:45:53] <adtaylor> mdunham918_:  not on the second box?
[10:46:09] <mdunham918_> adtaylor: why are you using blur why not use a var flag like var shouldRemove = false; then after whatever functions fire that you need to fire then set it to true and do something with it
[10:47:12] <mdunham918_> adtaylor: I click on link 2 and it just updates the box and says Box 2 in the title
[10:47:22] <mdunham918_> then when i click off it the blur fires and the box disappears
[10:47:38] <mdunham918_> you got some logic issues going on here i think
[10:51:46] <adtaylor> mdunham918_:  I think my demo was badly explained too — if you click on link 2 of Box 2 then it should fire an event! Even with the var flag (which I have in the plugin) I still need an event to start that logic. Right?

[14:29:24] <automagic> the pageX and pageY are the things added by jquery
[14:29:30] <bencc> automagic:  I guess I need to use el.offset().left - pageX
[14:30:24] <automagic> it has a lot of x, y relative coordinates. look here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event

When edit icon is pressed for a span the span is converted to input box and a save button appears. When pressing save, the value is posted to the server. I would fix width and height of the div and put a scrollbar in the div box if overflowed. Does this sound like a good solution or are th

[15:21:30] <speyburn> automagic: damn, it was that easy. I actually interpreted the whole thing wrong (im pretty new in jquery) :) but thanx! this helped
[15:22:42] <automagic> Since it seems that there is more activity in the channel I'll repeat my original question.
[15:22:59] <automagic> I have spent a few hours trying to figure out how to simulate a keypress event that would actually type a letter into an input field. There are many pages on the web regarding this topic but none of them seem to have the correct solution. My question is is it possible, and if yes then why doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/Ggw8Q/3/ work?
[15:23:28] <Spadeski> How come when I load stuff from php usin ajax and no animation for it work
[15:24:05] <molavy>  i really have problem using jquery live() on IE8,i use whole body update ,so i use live for my event ,but none of them don't work, i use jquery version 1.6.4 or check it via version 1.7-b1 ,but without any success
[15:24:15] <dabear> automagic: did you try the jquery ui simulate plugin? it hooks into native ways of creating events.. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/jquery.simulate.js
[15:25:40] <automagic> dabear: Yes, I tried using that plugin, and it didn't work for me.
[15:28:28] <automagic> I'm trying to write unit tests for a cursor manipulation class and the typing simulation through events seems to be the only way to have the functionality automatically tested
[15:33:29] <theonlytruestyle> http://www.livestream.com/globalrevolution - Witness Live police arresting peaceful protestors randomly at a 15 000 people march, at the moment 19 000+ are streaming this live. Lay witness to history my friends!!!
[15:34:34] <dabear> automagic: I see what you mean. I can't get it working either
[15:35:44] <Proteus^> automagic why not just do this? http://jsfiddle.net/Ggw8Q/5/
[15:40:53] <automagic> Proteus^: Because I want the cursor to move as well and I want the text to be typed at the cursor position.
[15:42:11] <automagic> Proteus^: I know that this can be achieved by manipulating the cursor position directly, but I need it to test the very thing - manipulating the cursor.
[15:43:07] <automagic> I think I will just give up and implement it without any unit tests.
[15:43:13] <dabear> automagic: tried http://bililite.com/blog/2011/01/23/improved-sendkeys/ ?
[15:44:44] <automagic> dabear: No, I haven't.
[15:46:03] <automagic> dabear: It seems to have the exact functionality I need. Thanks.
[15:46:16] <dabear> just some creative googling :)
[15:47:19] <dabear> automagic: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1468384/simulate-keypress-with-jquery
[15:47:23] <dabear> found it there
[15:47:31] <dabear> havent looked into how it works though
[15:58:41] <cbobo> How does jQuery work. If I put some $.change() on a certain class... but then my webpage does not 'flush' that certain class until later on in the html
[15:59:12] <cbobo> will jq automatically know that that class has been flushed and now viewable by the user, thus calling the .change to be added to that class?

[18:32:42] <balr0g> hey people, i need some light file manager + file editor for a simple plain FTP account i have... i looked at http://www.ajaxplorer.info/wordpress/ and doesnt like me... on the other side, jqueryFileTree http://abeautifulsite.net/blog/2008/03/jquery-file-tree/ seems good ive already tested... but i dont find some file editor to use together with that jqueryFileTree... what file editor do you
[18:32:42] <balr0g> recommend with easy integration with jqueryFileTree?? or what kind of app do you use in these cases where you need some light file explorer&editor in plain FTP accounts??

[18:46:58] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[18:47:24] <Aquaguy> I'm trying to make all the inputs readonly but it doesn't seem to work, I've tried $('input').attr('readonly', 'readonly'); and $('input').attr('readonly', true);
[18:47:27] <Aquaguy> no success
[18:47:29] <Aquaguy> :(
[18:52:09] <balr0g> Aquaguy, did you check firebug or the console??
[18:55:50] <Aquaguy> balr0g, yeah, no errors/warnings
[18:59:11] <Aquaguy> balr0g, alright the problem is that jquery is adding just readonly
[18:59:19] <Aquaguy> instead of readonly="readonly"
[18:59:25] <Aquaguy> why is that?
[18:59:39] <coldhead> because you're using some oldschool doctype
[18:59:49] <coldhead> readonly is sufficient in modern doctypes
[19:00:24] <Aquaguy> I'm not
[19:00:37] <balr0g> Aquaguy, what are you using?
[19:00:40] <Aquaguy> jquery is, maybe the library of this client is pretty old, let me check
[19:00:55] <Aquaguy> buff nevermind, he is using 1.4.4
[19:01:02] <Aquaguy> so that's it
[19:01:41] <coldhead> case cloased
[19:01:41] <Aquaguy> If I update 1.4.4 to the current version will any of the code stop working?
[19:02:08] <coldhead> there have been some changes to the attr function
[19:02:16] <coldhead> and the AJAX internals are different
[19:02:22] <coldhead> those are the main differences
[19:02:31] <coldhead> you can probably get away with it
[19:02:33] <coldhead> try it and see :)
[19:02:43] <coldhead> you always hotlink to the google CDN
[19:03:02] <coldhead> and easily change version numbers in the URL there
[19:03:11] <coldhead> to try different versions
[19:07:04] <Aquaguy> Actually I'm getting an "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[19:08:14] <balr0g> hmm.. google the error
[19:08:46] <Aquaguy> The problem is that I dont get the line of code that causes the error, so I dont know where to look
[19:13:53] <coldhead> it should show the line number, Aquaguy
[19:14:00] <coldhead> in your debugger
[19:14:19] <coldhead> alternatively, put a live link up for someone who has a debugger
[19:26:29] <oojacoboo> how can I get slideUp and slideDown to not resize with padding
[19:26:41] <oojacoboo> it doesn't just animate the up/down

[19:39:57] <coldhead> richardr: do you want to put some pseudocode up on jsfiddle?
[19:40:16] <coldhead> an example of how you'd like it to work?
[19:40:19] <richardr> coldhead: ya
[19:40:22] <richardr> coldhead: 1 moment thanks
[19:44:36] <MikeH`> Evening
[19:44:55] <richardr> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/nNXvg/ its not valid but just putting my ideas on the page
[19:45:10] <MikeH`> I'm trying to create an animated counter, however I'm having a little bit of trouble. I think it's probably just some fresh eyes required but can anyone see whats going wrong here? http://vxr.in/share/test.html
[19:45:27] <MikeH`> On the first click of go, the number should be 15 and only the bottom number should move
[19:45:32] <MikeH`> I've no idea how the top number is changing
[19:48:19] <richardr> coldhead: hopefully that makes sense, I can try add some more commenting if not
[19:51:39] <Spadeski> How do I chdck if div is empty?
[19:51:44] <Spadeski> check
[19:53:02] <coldhead> $('div').text() === ''
[19:53:18] <coldhead> or possibly .html()
[19:53:42] <coldhead> richardr: i'm taking a look now
[19:54:10] <Spadeski> thanks holdhead
[19:54:17] <Spadeski> grr hate laptops
[19:54:42] <coldhead> this looks okay to me, richardr
[19:55:28] <coldhead> i don't see why this wouldn't work
[19:56:46] <coldhead> richardr: i would just extend the idea with a couple of methods like this http://jsfiddle.net/nNXvg/2/
[19:57:14] <Spadeski> coldhead can you help me figure out why divs loading through ajax wont work for their animations?
[19:57:52] <dabd> I'd like to obtain [[1 1] [2 2]] from [1 2] but (map #([% %]) [1 2]) does not work.  What is wrong with the anonymous function syntax? thx
[19:58:29] <dabd> oops wrong room
[20:07:59] <coldhead> got a link Spadeski ?
[20:08:13] <coldhead> incidentally, is it "spade ski" or "spad esk ee"?
[20:08:33] <Spadeski> spadeski like broski
[20:08:36] <Spadeski> lol
[20:09:40] <Spadeski> http://209.172.30.223/WWWRoot/?page=articles The articles when you hover it is meant too show text in the orange on the right
[20:11:36] <richardr> coldhead: any other technique to do that? seems a bit... pointless to have empty functions like that ?
[20:16:24] <richardr> And I need to apply this technique in a lot of other places, I'm almost like trying to create a data type ?
[20:16:27] <richardr> pf
[20:16:30] <richardr> of 'Space'.
[20:17:11] <coldhead> they're not empty, they're placeholders :)
[20:17:15] <coldhead> YOU get to make them work
[20:17:40] <Spadeski> coldhead It may load slow as before
[20:17:45] <richardr> Ah, I just feel it's a very redundent function. Is there any other approaches?
[20:18:39] <coldhead> richardr: the most JS way to do it would be to create a space prototype and use new Space()
[20:18:46] <coldhead> you might want to read up on that
[20:18:54] <richardr> coldhead: that is *exactly* what I'm looking for I think
[20:19:19] <richardr> coldhead: I've tried to read a little on it but I couldn't get it working within my container
[20:19:28] <richardr> The examples I found used slightly different syntax
[20:19:41] <richardr> That's sort of why I have the *idea* down, just not sure about implementation
[20:22:28] <coldhead> richardr: take a look at how papa crockford suggests you do prototypal objects in his seminal Javascript: The Good Parts
[20:22:34] <coldhead> that's what i'd be reviewing
[20:24:25] <richardr> coldhead: I sort of understand that, thanks - I think it is more what I was after
[20:25:06] <coldhead> Spadeski: looks like you just need to bam the z-index of download_bar up to 20
[20:25:35] <Spadeski> coldhead ill try that
[20:26:21] <Spadeski> coldhead no dice
[20:26:48] <Spadeski> its suppposed to slide to the right
[20:28:50] <coldhead> Spadeski: all i did was add border:1px solid #0f0 to the download_bar in web inspector
[20:29:07] <coldhead> then moved the z-index up until the green borders were visible
[20:29:21] <Spadeski> Did is slide?
[20:29:24] <coldhead> no
[20:29:29] <coldhead> that's a second problem
[20:29:38] <coldhead> but at least with that z-index you can SEE it not slide
[20:29:46] <coldhead> instead of just imaging that's what's happening
[20:29:47] <Spadeski> yeah i gotcha
[20:30:12] <ch3mical> Hey can someone show me an example of how to use jQuery.extend to extend a jQuery plugin?
[20:31:42] <ch3mical> I tried simply doing $.extend($.fn.newplugin, $.fn.origplugin, object literal of my additions to the plugin)
[20:32:07] <ch3mical> Which doesn't work, because then $.fn.newplugin is no longer a function
[20:32:32] <ch3mical> I guess I'm going about it the wrong way
[20:32:39] <richardr> coldhead: how would I create a function() prototype like that within my variable container in the example earlier? The syntax examples are always different to what I'm writing
[20:33:16] <ch3mical> functionName.prototype?
[20:35:15] <ch3mical> richardr: http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html
[20:35:25] <richardr> ch3mical: that's what I'm reading
[20:35:38] <ch3mical> Good
[20:35:41] <richardr> ch3mical: my syntax is a bit different:                   object literal of my additions to the plugin)
[20:35:51] <richardr> http://jsfiddle.net/nNXvg/ *
[20:37:52] <ch3mical> Right, so you don't prototype an object literal
[20:38:27] <richardr> ch3mical: what structure changes do I have to make?
[20:38:39] <ch3mical> What are you trying to _accomplish_ is the question? (Don't confuse that with "what are you trying to do" which the answer is currently "prototype something")
[20:39:16] <ch3mical> In other words, what were you trying to do that led you to think you would prototype?
[20:39:19] <richardr> ch3mical: I want Space to act as a data-type, it belongs in Container. I want to be able to push multiple Spaces into an array (just a list of them), each have unique characteristics.
[20:39:45] <ch3mical> Dig deeper
[20:40:08] <richardr> Each time I push an object into this array, 'spaces' - it needs to follow the pattern/interface I've set in Space = { layout, tag, stack... etc.
[20:40:26] <richardr> I don't want to create redundent functions like getSpace, setSpace, etc
[20:41:30] <ch3mical> ok
[20:41:38] <ch3mical> How DO you want to set/get a space?
[20:41:47] <ch3mical> If not by creating a function to do that?
[20:42:26] <richardr> It would be nice to do .push(new Space({ layout: 'simple', tag: 1, stack: [] })); and afterwards I want to be able to manipulate it like this.spaces[0].stack.push(1); or something along those lines
[20:42:48] <ch3mical> Seems like from the OL you posted you could easily use Array functions... i.e. Container.spaces.push({object: "literals"})
[20:43:20] <ch3mical> You're over complicating it, I think
[20:43:32] <ch3mical> Container.spaces is an array, just use array methods
[20:43:43] <richardr> Ah, I see
[20:44:11] <richardr> I think I'm just thinking "data type" and that's causing a bit of confusion
[20:44:18] <richardr> But thanks I do agree
[20:44:27] <ch3mical> Unless there's something I'm missing
[20:44:36] <xenland> Hey chat
[20:44:46] <ch3mical> But I doubt there's anything you'd do with that array that couldn't be done with array methods
[20:45:14] <richardr> ch3mical: what If I want to add functions in there as well? Space.destroy() for example?
[20:45:31] <ch3mical> Space.destroy = function(...) {...}
[20:45:47] <xenland> Anyone know how to make an accordion open by default on a certain tag?
[20:46:08] <ch3mical> I would just write it directly into where you instantiate that literal, though, rather than tacking it on later
[20:46:27] <ch3mical> xenland: not off the top of my head.
[20:46:49] <richardr> ch3mical: thanks for your advice.
[20:47:03] <ch3mical> richardr: if you need any more advice/help, lemme know
[20:47:15] <ch3mical> And you're welcome :)
[20:47:37] <ch3mical> Now someone help me with my problem :P
[20:48:56] <ch3mical> richardr: (by the way, your question was technically better suited for #javascript ... no worries, just keep it in mind) ;)
[20:50:01] <xenland> .active() was the answer
[20:50:18] <xenland> What is your issue ch3mical?
[20:50:47] <ch3mical> I tried simply doing $.extend($.fn.newplugin, $.fn.origplugin, object literal of my additions to the plugin)
[20:50:57] <ch3mical> Hey can someone show me an example of how to use jQuery.extend to extend a jQuery plugin?
[20:51:08] <ch3mical> Sorry, pasted them in reverse order
[20:51:58] <richardr> ch3mical: ah, there was one thing though. My stack implements a `zipper` data structure (cursor?)
[20:52:00] <ch3mical> I'm actually going to see if it can be prototyped. I think I was just going about this the wrong way
[20:52:01] <xenland> Usually when you extend a property you don't normally replace properties its more like adding on to the already set properties
[20:52:23] <richardr> ch3mical: doing this every time i add that object directly would be a bit repetitive
[20:52:30] <ch3mical> xenland: I'm not replacing, adding stuff
[20:52:49] <xenland> okay, Becuase it said, newplugin and origplugin, so it kind of seems like that at first
[20:53:17] <ch3mical> richardr: if you're using Array.push() you could prototype THAT to add whatever functionality you need to happen each time an object is added to the stack
[20:53:42] <ch3mical> xenland: yeah, that's why I'm saying I probably just approached the problem wrong
[20:53:43] <richardr> ch3mical: ah, do you have any material I could read about this?
[20:53:55] <ch3mical> xenland: I'll get back to it in a bit
[20:54:19] <ch3mical> richardr: I'd have to dig around in my bookmarks, but it might be easier just to walk you through it
[20:54:40] <ch3mical> If you want
[20:54:49] <richardr> ch3mical: I would appreciate it * a lot * . Thanks !
[20:55:12] <ch3mical> Let's move to IM, since we'll probably be spamming quite a bit

[22:02:34] <chadkouse> hey guys quick question — this is odd.. I am trying to use $.post to post some json to an ajax handler...
[22:02:41] <chadkouse> it doesn't work, but the success handler fires..
[22:02:53] <chadkouse> and if I put an alert('anything'); before the $.post call — THEN it works ?
[22:02:56] <chadkouse> wtf?
[22:03:00] <whackyMan> chadkouse: put it up on jsfiddle for us to look at?
[22:03:15] <chadkouse> sure
[22:03:20] <whackyMan> chadkouse: that sounds very odd indeed.
[22:03:58] <molavy> i really have problem using jquery live() on IE8,i use whole body update ,so i use live for my event ,but none of them don't work, i use jquery version 1.6.4 or check it via version 1.7-b1 ,but without any success
[22:03:58] <chadkouse> whackyMan: http://jsfiddle.net/PjjmU/
[22:04:14] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i'll take a look.
[22:04:44] <chadkouse> simple photo uploader — with an ajax method to allow me to add some data to mysql in the background
[22:05:03] <chadkouse> fileuploaddone fires after each file is finished
[22:05:08] <chadkouse> fileuploadstop fires after all files are done
[22:06:23] <chadkouse> whackyMan: I don't see the post to /admin/photos_admin.php in my apache access logs — but I do see the GET for /admin/photos_admin.php (with the &added=true on the end) indicating the .success handler fires
[22:06:57] <chadkouse> and like I said if I add alert('hi') before the $.post — it works as expected…
[22:07:29] <chadkouse> but that seems too hacky even for me
[22:07:39] <whackyMan> chadkouse: add te alert(...) for me to see will you.
[22:07:43] <whackyMan> *the
[22:08:01] <chadkouse> k just did.
[22:08:05] <chadkouse> http://jsfiddle.net/PjjmU/1/
[22:08:35] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i would put the full uri for post to see.
[22:08:54] <chadkouse> ok will try that
[22:11:11] <whackyMan> chadkouse:  also putting php code in the javascript won't work i believe?
[22:11:32] <whackyMan> chadkouse:  e.g., ?>&album_id=<?php echo $_REQUEST["album_id"];...
[22:11:33] <chadkouse> whackyMan: seems to work ok, it's like there's some race condition or something going on.
[22:12:26] <chadkouse> it's sorta like the success is firing first.
[22:12:42] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i assume the current path is not the same as you have in javascript so you need to put full uri...
[22:13:14] <chadkouse> but why would it work if I add an alert ?
[22:13:19] <chadkouse> if paths were wrong, for example.
[22:13:42] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i don't think it was really working with an alert...
[22:13:52] <chadkouse> no it really is
[22:13:58] <chadkouse> I can guarantee that.
[22:14:14] <molavy> any idea?
[22:14:44] <chadkouse> I can make the script work or not work based solely on adding or removing an alert.
[22:15:35] <chadkouse> oh well I guess I'll just leave a hacky alert in there for now… makes no sense to me.
[22:16:02] <whackyMan> chadkouse: logically that doesn't make sense so that tells me its probably not really working in the way it should.
[22:16:18] <whackyMan> chadkouse: didn't the full uri work?
[22:16:27] <chadkouse> whackyMan:  no
[22:16:40] <chadkouse> well yes - if I have an alert in front.
[22:16:53] <chadkouse> and yeah i know it doesn't make sense, that's why I had to come to IRC and ask the pros.
[22:17:07] <whackyMan> chadkouse: pls double check that the uri is what you want.
[22:17:20] <whackyMan> chadkouse: alert out the uri
[22:17:27] <chadkouse> i did and it is
[22:17:29] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i bet its wrong.
[22:17:38] <chadkouse> no it's fine.
[22:18:14] <chadkouse> i think I need to defer that .success handler.
[22:18:23] <chadkouse> the dom is getting confused or something
[22:18:40] <molavy> there is no idaa?
[22:18:46] <molavy> idea?
[22:19:07] <whackyMan> chadkouse: what you referring to as success handler?
[22:19:22] <chadkouse> the .success part
[22:19:29] <chadkouse> where it's doing window.location = .....
[22:19:34] <chadkouse> that is definitely firing.
[22:20:44] <whackyMan> chadkouse: i see. thats not how i do success handler for $.post()
[22:21:15] <whackyMan> chadkouse: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[22:21:50] <chadkouse> doesn't that basically say to do it how I'm doing it ?
[22:22:15] <chadkouse> $.post(url, data).sucess(..).error(..).complete(..); ?
[22:22:53] <chadkouse> i suppose I can try it like one of the other examples and make it the 3rd param of the .post function
[22:22:53] <whackyMan> jQuery.post( url, [data,] [success(data, textStatus, jqXHR),] [dataType]
[22:23:52] <whackyMan> chadkouse: give it a try. might not make any difference.
[22:23:58] <chadkouse> trying now
[22:24:06] <chadkouse> hey it worked!
[22:24:08] <chadkouse> w00t.
[22:24:09] <chadkouse> thx..
[22:24:14] <whackyMan> :D
[22:24:15] <chadkouse> no more hacky alert!
[22:24:26] <chadkouse> must be something weird there — firing the success handler before the post
[22:24:34] <whackyMan> yes
[22:25:09] <chadkouse> fyi
[22:25:09] <chadkouse> http://jsfiddle.net/PjjmU/2/
[22:25:12] <chadkouse> working code
[22:25:46] <whackyMan> chadkouse: how to check if <p></p> has no child elements or empty basically?
[22:26:39] <chadkouse> .isEmptyObject() ?
[22:26:43] <chadkouse> whackyMan: ^
[22:26:56] <whackyMan> ok i try that
[22:27:05] <chadkouse> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/
[22:44:32] <whackyMan> chadkouse: u there?
[22:49:19] <molavy> i really have problem using jquery live() on IE8, that is about submit formi use whole body update ,so i use live for my event ,but none of them don't work, i use jquery version 1.6.4 or check it via version 1.7-b1 ,but without any success
[22:50:21] <whackyMan> molavy: show problem in jsfiddle.net
[22:50:54] <chadkouse> whackyMan: yeah sorta
[22:51:34] <whackyMan> molavy: you should check success textStatus?
[23:01:30] <pouledodue>  $('input[type=file]').uploadify({  HOW CAN I REFER TO INPUT ID FROM HERE??  })
[23:03:09] <Spadeski> pouledodue this.id
[23:06:59] <pouledodue> Spadeski: undefined
[23:07:19] <Spadeski> then you have too define an id on there
[23:07:49] <chadkouse> do you have <input type="file" id="some_id" /> ?
[23:07:54] <chadkouse> id != name btw
[23:08:31] <Spadeski> chadkouse: I hate that so mushc
[23:08:33] <Spadeski> much
[23:08:40] <chadkouse> hehe. yeah..
[23:08:48] <chadkouse> redundant
[23:09:20] <Spadeski> chadkouse I need ideas ...
[23:09:46] <pouledodue> chadkouse: yes id is defined in the <input...
[23:09:48] <chadkouse> http://www.ideas.com/ ?
[23:10:00] <whackyMan> lol
[23:10:23] <Spadeski> lol
[23:10:48] <Spadeski> I need some kind of product hmmm
[23:10:52] <chadkouse> pouledodue:  do you have multiple input type="file"
[23:11:01] <pouledodue> chadkouse: yes 2
[23:13:06] <chadkouse> do you maybe want $('input[type="file"]') ?
[23:13:21] <chadkouse> or even $("input:file")
[23:13:40] <chadkouse> also I'm not sure how it would work if you're trying to get the ID of that even though there are 2.
[23:14:26] <chadkouse> (trying to find out now)
[23:16:04] <chadkouse> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6973585/jquery-multiple-selectors-this-reference
[23:16:07] <chadkouse> looks like it should work
[23:16:20] <Spadeski> chadkouse wanna get in on a little project im trying to do ?
[23:16:22] <chadkouse> do both of your type="file" have ids ?
[23:16:33] <cypha> can someone tell me why in ff the chosen file does not show up here in the text box?--> http://68.198.22.26:8000/test
[23:16:39] <chadkouse> Spadeski: depends on the project
[23:17:01] <chadkouse> cypha: (also in chrome)
[23:17:11] <Spadeski> chadkouse Just I wanna make a 5-star rating system with images and drag and drop feature to rate them on order
[23:17:24] <chadkouse> cypha: maybe because there is no <form></form> around it
[23:18:24] <chadkouse> cypha: but also I'm not sure if the "multiple" option is fully supported yet.
[23:18:33] <cypha> hmm
[23:18:36] <cypha> good point
[23:19:08] <chadkouse> cypha: although from what I'm reading safari, chrome, and FF should all work with it.
[23:19:18] <chadkouse> cypha: try throwing a <form> around it
[23:19:27] <ckknight> Is there an easy way to create a form from scratch, specify some simple text inputs for it, then submit it (with a refresh, so the browser follows it)?
[23:19:30] <cypha> chadkouse, just put form around it, still didn't work
[23:19:49] <chadkouse> cypha: I get a javascript error also
[23:19:51] <diverdude> Does empty() actually remove the element from DOM and delete it?
[23:20:04] <cypha> what's the error?
[23:20:35] <diverdude> cypha, me?
[23:20:39] <chadkouse> cypha: http://pastebin.com/hgPCaBdU
[23:21:13] <cypha> oh, i have no idea what that means
[23:21:17] <chadkouse> hehe
[23:21:19] <chadkouse> yeah me either
[23:21:40] <chadkouse> will be hard to debug using the .min files
[23:21:45] <cypha> oh
[23:22:01] <cypha> do u have any interest in this script?
[23:22:05] <cypha> maybe you wanna help me troubleshoot?
[23:22:20] <cypha> well, i guess ur already doing that :)
[23:22:25] <pouledodue> chadkouse: humm seems to be a uploadify-specific solution… http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4524712/uploadify-passing-a-forms-id-as-a-parameter-with-scriptdata
[23:22:29] <chadkouse> I'm actually just about to hit the sack… see if you get that same js error in the browsers it does work in
[23:22:43] <cypha> how do you get that error?
[23:22:54] <chadkouse> what browser does it work in, IE ?
[23:22:56] <pouledodue> chadkouse: thx for help
[23:23:01] <chadkouse> pouledodue: np
[23:23:18] <chadkouse> cypha: what browser(s) are you seeing it work properly in ?
[23:23:38] <chadkouse> I am using chrome and I can just go to view->developer->javascript console
[23:23:51] <chadkouse> but other browsers have different methods to see the js console
[23:24:11] <chadkouse> easiest way is probably to use firebug I guess ?
[23:24:22] <chadkouse> like firebug lite
[23:24:28] <chadkouse> http://getfirebug.com/firebuglite
[23:24:39] <chadkouse> i gots 'ta run — good luck.
[23:35:43] <Agamemnus> *a tumbleweed blows by*
[23:47:05] <Hyphenex> Hey everyone.  I'm trying to use jQueryUI, but the dialog looks horrible because of the page I'm using it on has things like body css styles set.  Is there a way I can get .dialog({… to overwrite all the defaults in its elements?
