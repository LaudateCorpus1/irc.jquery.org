[00:58:25] <hackeron> hey, I want to collapse a sidepanel - basically $("#sidebar-nav").hide() - on a resize event if the window becomes too small. However on the ipad, bringing up a keyboard triggers the $(window).on('resizestop') event. Is there anyway to detect if this event was caused by the virtual keyboard?
[01:57:18] <superdo> hi
[01:57:26] <superdo> how to find fb:like element with Jquery?
[02:00:38] <megalomix> hello
[02:01:03] <megalomix> could someone explain my what wrong with: $("input[name^='AdRegion']").mousedown(function(){ .... });
[02:01:22] <megalomix> i have a list of checkboxes with id=AdRegion1
[02:01:24] <megalomix> id=AdRegion2
[02:01:40] <megalomix> etc etc, how can i get the event on the click of those checkboexes ?
[02:02:22] <megalomix> with this i perfectly get the number of selected checkboxes: alert($("input[name^='AdRegion' type!='hidden']:checked").length);
[02:02:34] <megalomix> but i need to get this number only when there is an event
[02:02:54] <megalomix> click or mousedown i think
[02:06:13] <megalomix> nobody here ?
[02:09:25] <tdignan> megalomix: you have them with id="AdRegion2" but you're trying to match the name attribute?
[02:09:36] <tdignan> maybe you should use # instead to match ids.
[02:09:50] <megalomix> tdignan, my bad...i need to select all id that starts with AdRegion
[02:10:13] <tdignan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5002966/jquery-or-css-selector-select-all-ids-that-start-with
[02:10:45] <tdignan> search-fu
[02:11:00] <megalomix> yes
[02:11:07] <megalomix> my bad i wrote name instead of id
[02:11:10] <megalomix> grrrr :(
[02:11:15] <tdignan> heh
[02:12:11] <megalomix> ok now it works correctly
[02:12:12] <megalomix> but
[02:12:22] <megalomix> alert($("input[id^='AdRegion' type!='hidden']:checked").length); <----- does NOT count correctly
[02:14:27] <megalomix> tdignan, whats wrong?
[02:18:26] <megalomix> tdignan, i really do not see any errors
[02:18:36] <megalomix> i only added type != 'hidden'
[02:19:47] <air_> megalomix: maybe you should jsfiddle it?
[02:22:16] <megalomix> air_, i try
[02:24:11] <megalomix> air_, http://jsfiddle.net/eyLB4/
[02:24:25] <megalomix> as you can see if you select a region....the count is always 0
[02:26:57] <tdignan> http://jsfiddle.net/eyLB4/
[02:27:09] <tdignan> http://jsfiddle.net/tdignan/eyLB4/1/
[02:27:26] <tdignan> i'm not sure what that type part was for
[02:27:55] <megalomix> tdignan, you just removed hidden ?
[02:28:02] <tdignan> yes
[02:28:09] <tdignan> i think that was a syntax error.
[02:29:34] <air_> yes, type hidden can't be a checkbox.
[02:30:46] <megalomix> ok
[02:32:07] <air_> megalomix: if you want to specifically find checkboxes, you can always do it like:             alert($("input:checkbox[id^='AdRegion']:checked").length);
[02:33:06] <megalomix> ok
[02:33:14] <megalomix> perfect! thank you so much guys
[02:34:07] <air_> I wonder if it wouldn't (theoretically) be better to select as input:checkbox:checked[id^='AdRegion']
[02:35:07] <air_> as the regexp would likely be slower than the other selectors.
[02:36:33] <megalomix> interesting
[02:36:34] <megalomix> good
[02:36:35] <megalomix> thanks
[02:36:43] <air_> megalomix: note from http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[02:36:57] <air_> "However it will be slower than using a class selector so leverage classes, if you can, to group like elements."
[02:37:23] <megalomix> good
[02:37:28] <megalomix> i did not know
[02:37:29] <megalomix> ok
[02:38:07] <air_> well, if it requires regexp, it's likely a higher cost than a direct selection. so minimizing the scope (or completely avoiding it) will be a better solution.
[02:38:24] <air_> in the end, it probably wouldn't matter for you case. :)
[02:42:47] <megalomix> thank you
[02:42:49] <megalomix> i have to go
[02:42:51] <megalomix> have a great day
[02:42:52] <megalomix> bye
[02:53:58] <motaka2> is it so awfull to use data-* in html 4 ?
[02:55:06] <Haprog> why would you do HTML 4 instead of 5?
[02:57:24] <motaka2> Haprog: Right now I scare of javascript breaks if I change it to html5 , for example does IE7 understands HTML5? and there are thousands of view which are maybe invalid in HTML5
[02:58:21] <aMoniker> motaka2: Fuck IE7.
[02:58:42] <vinex08> i do have a menu with dropdown using css only, i want a smooth transition of bg when i hover the mouse on li's , how can i do this?
[02:59:17] <vinex08> something like fade-in dafe out of bg when i hover the mouse on li.
[02:59:31] <motaka2> Haprog: Right now , I have a table which it's rows are comming from database, I want when a user clicks on a row link called delete, the row in the table also got deleted
[03:00:18] <motaka2> but i dont know how to assign id to that link - i prefer data-id="$dbId" but It is not valid in HTML4
[03:01:28] <Haprog> I wouldn't worry so much about invalidities
[03:02:28] <Haprog> I think even many frameworks and libraries use their own invalid attributes on HTML elements
[03:02:37] <motaka2> vinex08: http://www.kriesi.at/archives/create-a-multilevel-dropdown-menu-with-css-and-improve-it-via-jquery
[03:02:58] <motaka2> Haprog: Yupe, thx, I'll do the same
[03:04:21] <Haprog> or if you really want to be valid, you could do something like add a class of "data-id-123" etc to the element and check for that class name beginning with data-id

[04:38:03] <zergion> I have some encoding issues with .ajax post's, to fix this I use contentType: 'charset=utf-8', however, when I use this contentType the data is still being sent but not recongnized in the php code. So am I using contentType wrong?
[04:38:30] <zergion> http://jsfiddle.net/PdFSY/
[04:49:54] <dersand> is the .ready event handler only avaiable for the document selector? or could it be used for e.g $("img").ready()?
[04:52:56] <snql> you do not want to help me because I'm black?
[05:01:28] <yogurt_truck> wat
[05:09:45] <zergion> This is driving me nuts, ajax post refuse to send utf-8 to my php doc and therefor I am missing chars and they are replaced with : Ã¶ and shit, what causes this?
[05:10:47] <zergion> nvm, it does send in utf-8. However the php file is unable to handle it.
[05:20:48] <zergion> sigh, was the god damn htmlentities
[05:32:08] <RishiKul> This is my JS code http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=QsySJjk6 what I'm trying to achieve is a separate "p" html tags instead of generating all values in a single generated "p" tag

[05:57:24] <mowol> Any tips for creating a div kind of select box? So a select without the dropdown

[06:14:00] <mowol> oh well i made my own: http://jsfiddle.net/pwZJS/ Anything horribly wrong with this code?

[06:40:41] <air_> Nobita_: http://jsfiddle.net/gSBTa/
[06:41:35] <air_> that's just a correction of the errors; 1. include jquery, 2. refer to flex-caption instead of some non-existing h3.
[06:42:08] <Nobita_> ok air_ , thanks but I'm trying to add "p" tag to the inner values of my .flex-caption

[09:12:28] <bradbrad> Im using superscrollorama on one part of my website, that works fine, but I want to implement a different animation further down, but it just wont work! Please have a look, NB it is still early in developement, so try not be too harsh :)

[10:00:49] <s1m0ne> jQuery('html, body').trigger('wheel', {'deltaMode': 1, 'deltaX': 3, 'deltaY': 0});   It DOES trigger the event, but it DOES NOT have the data (deltaX, deltaY, deltaMode). How can I trigger the wheel event AND passing the data?
[10:09:17] <s1m0ne> what the hell, over 800 people here in jQuery and NOTHING happens?
[10:09:52] <s1m0ne> nobody who has a clue why the event data i am passing isn't available when I catch the fired event?
[10:11:28] <ngharo> s1m0ne: the docs show that extra data should be in an array
[10:12:15] <ngharo> scratch that, "or plain object"
[10:13:02] <ngharo> s1m0ne: how are you catching the event
[10:15:00] <s1m0ne> jQuery('html').on('wheel', function (e) { console.log(e); });
[10:15:19] <s1m0ne> ngharo
[10:16:36] <ngharo> e doesn't have your data
[10:16:43] <s1m0ne> exactly
[10:16:46] <ngharo> function(e, data) { console.log(data) }
[10:17:34] <s1m0ne> hm ok, maybe. but the real problem is, I do not want to have the data for something in my code. I just want that the browser does what it is supposed to do on a wheel event.
[10:18:11] <s1m0ne> my whole intention is to catch the wheel event, check if it is vertical scrolling and then fire a horizontal scrolling wheel event.
[10:19:07] <jackw411> s1m0ne - the mousewheel plugin is your friend
[10:19:43] <s1m0ne> jackw411, i tried it, but i cannot fire an event which brings the browser to scroll too.
[10:19:45] <s1m0ne> i think

[11:16:09] <scalex000> hello, how can I prevent to user click again while is searching data ?
[11:16:28] <eziob> scalex000, are you using bootstrap?
[11:17:48] <scalex000> eziob, i have no idea :P
[11:18:04] <eziob> anyone know why $('#whitelist_command').removeClass('disabled'); isn't doing anything but returning a copy of the button without any style ... not actually affecting the button
[11:18:19] <eziob> scalex000, then set a variable to true when it starts the operation
[11:18:21] <eziob> and false after
[11:18:24] <scalex000> eziob, no
[11:18:30] <eziob> ok
[11:18:42] <eziob> oh ... sorry
[11:18:47] <scalex000> eziob, im using neatbean im developing in php
[11:18:49] <eziob> you can add the class disabled to the button
[11:19:16] <eziob> scalex000, right in the js you want to add the class disabled to the button
[11:19:25] <eziob> just before you start your server call
[11:19:39] <eziob> and in the server call's return, remove the disabled class
[11:19:40] <scalex000> okey
[11:19:49] <eziob> there's still a bit of room for race condition though
[11:21:01] <eziob> scalex000, at the top of the function you'll want if($('#mybutton').hasClass('disabled'))return;
[11:22:09] <scalex000> eziob, wait, on this jquery and javascript Im not a kerosene im a diesel
[11:23:17] <eziob> no idea what the fuck you're talking about
[11:23:31] <eziob> you should have something like this
[11:24:06] <eziob> $('#mybutton').click(function() { makeaservercall() ...
[11:24:21] <eziob> in that function ... just check if the button is disabled
[11:24:28] <eziob> and if it is, then return
[11:25:15] <eziob> scalex000, you should really try to learn bootstrap
[11:25:52] <scalex000> I will, for now I try to get jquery and another javascript library hahahaha, and php too
[11:26:28] <eziob> scalex000, what i told you should be agnostic of other js libraries/php
[11:26:51] <eziob> but jquery before bootstrap is cart before horse
[11:27:06] <scalex000> eziob, jajaja
[11:27:38] <eziob> and you've never had it as easy as you'll have it after you learn bootstrap which i could literally give you two minutes of typing to explain enough
[11:30:21] <scalex000> eziob,I need to finish something i will learn bootstrap.
[11:30:37] <scalex000> eziob, you know have a dilema with datepicker
[11:30:52] <eziob> cool by me ... just selling you on it for later
[11:31:54] <scalex000> eziob, im using dateformat, altfield, altformat
[11:32:18] <eziob> each date picker is different
[11:33:41] <scalex000> eziob, its simple show to user a format and set behind the scene another format
[11:34:11] <eziob> scalex000, i find it always helpful to keep my timestams in unix timestamp format
[11:34:26] <eziob> it's usually easy to convert from unix timestamp format to any format and back again
[11:34:48] <scalex000> really
[11:35:29] <eziob> definitely ... unix timestamp is the general standard ... you should always be able to find help documents about how to translate unix timestamp formats to whatever technology you're using
[11:36:09] <eziob> unix timestamps support utc, most databases automatically produce unix timestamps
[11:36:34] <eziob> and unix timestamps are just an integer so they're easy to store and sort
[11:36:57] <eziob> do you know what a unix timestamp is?
[11:37:45] <eziob> it's the numerical value of the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970
[11:53:16] <eziob> sara spelt without an h was getting bored
[11:53:21] <eziob> on a pevey amp in 1984

[11:53:44] <eziob> playing sara with no h's favourite song

[12:28:34] <shoky> dersand: you can use it with other stuff but it wont have a different effect, it's still an event for when the document (DOM) is ready

[14:24:26] <scalex000> eziob, but I can't find in the bootraps site how to create custom css

[15:10:36] <Sal> but now, i don't know how to define that function indide jq
[15:10:40] <Sal> oh
[15:10:43] <Sal> the how?
[15:10:49] <Sal> sorry, i'm new to jq
[15:10:51] <diverdude> bind it using jquuery
[15:11:07] <Sal> can you please show me how?
[15:11:19] <Sal> the func name is sendBack and it has 2 parameters
[15:12:27] <diverdude> $("#urbtn").click(function(e){/*doStuff()*/})
[15:12:49] <Sal> oh, that way, inside the <script>
[15:12:55] <Sal> but i have many buttons
[15:13:01] <johnkpaul> Sal: <button data-something="1" data-name="John">
[15:13:06] <Sal> they are in a grid of data, every row has its own
[15:13:10] <diverdude> inside $(function(){   })
[15:13:26] <johnkpaul> Sal: $("button").click(function(){var name = $(this).data("name") // John});
[15:13:51] <Sal> trying
[15:13:53] <diverdude> Sal, if you have many, just add a handler to the class
[15:14:05] <diverdude> Sal, and use this to identify the button
[15:14:52] <diverdude> $(function(){  $(".urbtncls").click(function(e){/*doStuff()*/}) })
[15:15:48] <Blaster> iss there a limit to the amount of text you can store in a data attribute?
[15:16:01] <diverdude> Blaster, no
[15:16:08] <Blaster> cool thanks

[15:24:04] <Sal> what am i doing wrong?
[15:24:07] <Sal> its not working
[15:25:20] <diverdude> Sal, use $(".btn")
[15:25:29] <Sal> ok, try
[15:25:52] <Sal> nop
[15:26:06] <Sal> how can i check if the damn function gets called at all?
[15:26:29] <diverdude> console.log() ?
[15:26:43] <Sal> ?
[15:26:52] <Sal> aint there any popup i can open?
[15:26:54] <diverdude> i dont even know what you want to achieve or what your error is. You need to be more clear
[15:27:17] <diverdude> why would you want a popup?
[15:27:41] <Sal> i just need a way to know if it gets into the functions or not
[15:27:46] <diverdude> and what is parent.$.colorbox.close(); ?
[15:27:52] <Sal> i never used that consol stuff
[15:27:55] <vladikoff> Sal, http://try.jquery.com/levels/4/challenges/1
[15:27:57] <Sal> what should it do?
[15:28:22] <vladikoff> Sal, or just start from the beginning
[15:28:47] <diverdude> Sal, here: http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials
[15:31:33] <Sal> http://pastebin.com/E0PTunB9
[15:31:43] <Sal> i did this now, but i don't see any alert
[15:31:50] <Sal> so i think its not calling the function
[15:32:49] <tw2113> i'd change it to $('.btn')
[15:33:37] <Sal> tw2113: same thing
[15:34:40] <didiergm> jqm 1.3.0 - Popup show and vanishes immesiately on some version of Chrome/android and ios 5x (both safari &chrome)
[15:35:00] <didiergm> any idea how I can make it 'stick' for a wee while longer ?
[15:35:51] <Sal> hey guys!!
[15:35:56] <Sal> whit live it works
[15:35:59] <Sal> $('.btn').live('click', function(e){
[15:36:06] <Sal> whats the difference?
[15:36:14] <tw2113> dunno
[15:36:21] <tw2113> if you plan to move to 1.9+ though
[15:36:26] <tw2113> i'd ditch both bind and live
[15:36:35] <tw2113> i know live is removed completely
[15:36:40] <Sal> omg
[15:36:47] <tw2113> ?on
[15:36:48] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[15:37:04] <Sal> ?live
[15:37:04] <b-ot> Sal: deprecated
[15:37:05] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:37:15] <vladikoff> Sal, http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#live-removed
[15:37:33] <tw2113> i can assure you, it was removed in 1.9
[15:38:00] <tw2113> not just deprecated
[15:38:30] <Sal> i'm using jquery/1.7.1
[15:38:58] <tw2113> you can go with it if you plan to stay with that version
[15:39:11] <tw2113> but if you ever want to upgrade to a newer version...you'll have to rewrite this code again
[15:39:15] <Sal> ok
[15:42:09] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i'm doing this var ele = $(".child-details").prev(); i need a clause that says that only get the value form the child.details form an element that is not hidden
[15:43:49] <vladikoff> sheilablackrose, http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:44:08] <sheilablackrose> tq
[15:44:09] <bartzy> Hey
[15:44:33] <bartzy> is $('.class1, .class2') exactly the same as $('.class1').add('.class2') ? Same performance ?
[15:44:48] <QbY> can someone point me to example on automatically removing spaces and dashes in a input text?
[15:45:19] <sheilablackrose> vladikoff  var ele = $(".child-details").prev(); this would get the value of th ehidden field as well right
[15:45:41] <becom33> I know this is not much of a jquery question . but I'd lyk to know why this loop won't animate and show . like replace the demo id value each time http://pastebin.com/eDWqa5XD
[15:45:50] <sheilablackrose> so i just add if .is(":visible") to the query right
[15:46:57] <vladikoff> sheilablackrose, check .prev() again, it supports a selector and stuff, so maybe you can just use that
[15:47:33] <gates> I'm using jQuery Mobile, and I have a campaign script that uses document.write() to insert a script line and run a noscript otherwise, but since I am using an AJAX load it seems to be writing over the entire document blanking out the page - http://cl.ly/image/2r2q2v223243
[15:47:35] <gates> any ideas?
[15:48:01] <sheilablackrose> ic
[15:49:07] <gates> Should I use like an append() or osmething?
[16:06:39] <lotw> yo, anyone around?
[16:08:14] <wingedsnake> $.convertto('IraqiDinar').obama(function() { alert('I quit smoking'))};
[16:08:30] <wingedsnake> This is madness :)
[16:10:21] <lotw> having a bitch of a time with a draggable when it's dropped
[16:10:31] <lotw> it's calling the function twice and I just can't figure out why
[16:10:56] <lotw> ive done googling but it always seemed like the cause was with connecting it to sortable
[16:11:01] <lotw> im not using sortable at all
[16:11:06] <lotw> yet, same thing
[16:11:09] <lotw> triggers twice
[16:11:28] <gates> _|Nix|_: any thoughts
[16:12:01] <lotw> no, i have other draggables and droppables that are almost identical that function correctly
[16:12:11] <lotw> yet this one won't
[16:12:18] <lotw> it doesnt overlap with any other droppables either
[16:16:27] <lotw> it runs normally the first time but the second time it's called it fires twice
[16:17:33] <Guddu> Dear friends...Is there a way to control the width of the JQuery modal dialog box?
[16:18:15] <gates> Any ideas on an alterative to document.write() for using in jquery mobile and ajax page loads
[16:21:16] <wingedsnake> gates XMLHttpRequest ?
[16:22:21] <gates> Its a tracking script so its trying to work on noscript but i dont think the site even works iwthout javascript so nosript odesnt matter
[16:22:47] <gates> soo I just need to do a scr src=" " but they're generating a random number in the URL so it has to be printed :|
[16:25:35] <phonebook_> is that a regex problem?
[16:27:06] <gates> let me pastebin the code, please hold
[16:27:24] * grafi queues elevator music
[16:28:38] <gates> http://pastebin.com/p8m4fD1X
[16:28:40] <gates> the code is valid
[16:28:53] <gates> its just with jQuery Mobile mobile's AJAX load it messes up
[16:31:32] <gates> so I need to rewrite to append at the bottom but ofrwhatever reason I cannot seem to write it
[16:31:59] <coldhead> ?appendTo
[16:32:00] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[16:32:35] <gates> but there is no element there
[16:32:53] <gates> and im sure how that works with the ajax page loads when loading other pages
[16:35:57] <gates> What would I append to?
[16:36:09] <gates> can I put the random var in the URL without an issue?
[16:40:34] <grafi> i dont see why not oô
[16:41:19] <coldhead> it's all very gomblicated
[16:41:38] <grafi> apparently
[16:44:15] <kristofers> Hi, any suggestions on libraries i could use to be able to have XYZ axis and zoom on an image

[16:46:13] <phonebook_> ill post it, regardless, with an example even
[16:46:59] <kristofers> Not exactly sure what i need, but if possible i would like to add some pins on specific positions

[17:12:45] <JuanFernandoz> Hi guys, Give a hand please http://forum.jquery.com/topic/success-function-problem
[17:17:20] <o-R-e-N> anyone familiar with a simple solution to transform input.text values to uppercase while keeping placeholder's text unaffected?
[17:17:22] <shoky> JuanFernandoz: make a minimal testcase in http://jsfiddle.net
[17:18:01] <o-R-e-N> i can get something working for safari, but not firefox/ie
[17:18:08] <o-R-e-N> thanks for any help :)
[17:18:26] <o-R-e-N> pain in the arse!
[17:19:26] <o-R-e-N> i just want placeholder with no transformation, but when a user starts to type in the box, it is in uppercase.
[17:21:50] <kelye> oren, what kind of text are you expecting ? not sure about encoding but you can use .toUpperCase()
[17:23:05] <kelye> you might use that with keypress() event
[17:24:26] <shoky> why would transforming the input value do anything to the placeholder text
[17:25:34] <kelye> I think he's talking about doing some css, like to upper
[17:26:05] <shoky> ah
[17:26:19] <kelye> also depends on the 'placeholder' .. if it's html5 placeholder or javascript placeholder :D
[17:28:32] <o-R-e-N> sorry
[17:28:47] <o-R-e-N> it is html5.
[17:29:06] <oksushi> o-R-e-N: You can do that pretty easily with CSS
[17:29:07] <bobdobbs`> I've got a logic problem with a bit of code. I never seem to hit the 'if else' condition in this snippet: http://pastie.org/6587361
[17:29:31] <o-R-e-N> oksushi, i've been trying over and over to do that in css, however it only seems to work in Safari.
[17:29:35] <JuanFernandoz> @shoky http://jsfiddle.net/8tEpH/
[17:29:40] <oksushi> o-R-e-N: http://dabblet.com/gist/5184261
[17:30:06] <JuanFernandoz> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/8tEpH/
[17:30:21] <bobdobbs`> The 'if else' is inside a callback in slideToggle. I'm trying to change the css an element, depending on the value of the variable 'iconstate'
[17:30:43] <o-R-e-N> Thanks, oksushi, but what is happening when the input has a placeholder, is that the css will transform that as well.
[17:30:57] <JuanFernandoz> the save button dont execute the code inside the success funcion on "guardar" ajax call
[17:31:05] <bobdobbs`> However, when I click, I always hit the 'if' condition, and never the 'if else'.
[17:31:10] <bobdobbs`> What could I be doing wrong?
[17:31:56] <oksushi> o-R-e-N: sure, it will be default, but you can override it (see my example)
[17:32:23] <o-R-e-N> K, I don't see a placeholder though.
[17:32:23] <vacho> var circle = paper.circle(Math.floor((Math.random()*500)+1), Math.floor((Math.random()*500)+1), 5).data("id", i).attr({node: i});
[17:32:30] <vacho> how come that does not set the data value?
[17:32:51] <o-R-e-N> ahh, was looking in IE, I do see the placeholder in firefox.
[17:42:43] <JuanFernandoz> give me a hand guys http://jsfiddle.net/8tEpH/
[18:25:19] <kelye> o-R-e-N: you can use keypress event and .toUpperCase()
[18:26:00] <kelye> but that might be too heavy, depends
[18:27:21] <imsky> o-R-e-N, use a transform when the field is empty
[18:47:00] <vacho> guys..
[18:47:12] <vacho> I am using raphael.js and I cannot seem to draw points... http://pastebin.com/C9LGtdr5 can someone please take a look at this?
[18:47:31] <vacho> the call to function: createRect is breaking it.
[18:55:11] <shoky> vacho:  you need to pass that paper var so its accessible from createRect
[18:55:22] <shoky> look in your javascript console..
[19:06:11] <omani_> could someone pls have a look at this? http://jsfiddle.net/zxLdv/
[19:06:34] <omani_> I try to collapse my div again, but it comes to the bottom when it appears again
[19:06:45] <omani_> and the jsfiddle is somehow wrong. the button to toggle is on the right
[19:06:51] <omani_> and the collapsable div also
[19:10:51] <Fire-Dragon-DoL> oh there is jquery chan too
[19:10:54] <Fire-Dragon-DoL> I love freenode!
[19:13:26] <omani_> ^^
[19:22:42] <PAGO> soo hello :)
[19:22:45] <b1lly> :-*
[19:25:57] <PAGO> here i got some code. i think i made no mistake but it does only work for firefox. if someone would tell how i can make it work for other brosers too would be nice. http://snipt.org/zgjhc3
[19:28:31] <PAGO> mh
[19:28:44] <b1lly> PAGO whats the problem
[19:29:06] <PAGO> http://snipt.org/zgjhc3 this code only works for firefox and i dont know why
[19:29:31] <b1lly> if you put a alert()
[19:30:00] <b1lly> in the if (stickyTop < windowTop - 1) condition
[19:30:01] <b1lly> does it fire
[19:30:03] <b1lly> in other browsers?
[19:30:26] <PAGO> fire? it works on firefox yes
[19:30:38] <b1lly> does the alert
[19:30:40] <b1lly> FIRE
[19:30:43] <b1lly> in other browsers
[19:30:50] <b1lly> sorry, i'll type on one line now
[19:30:53] <b1lly> my fingers are a little cold
[19:31:03] <PAGO> np^^
[19:31:06] <b1lly> if you put the alert in the condition, does it trigger in other browsers?
[19:31:36] <PAGO> wait have to look up abput the alert command^^
[19:31:44] <b1lly> alert('hi');
[19:31:46] <b1lly> done!
[19:32:47] <barryhjames> Is there a reason why the following string isn't working? http://jsbin.com/ezihob/1/edit
[19:32:52] <PAGO> yes alert works
[19:32:58] <PAGO> it fires up^^
[19:33:00] <b1lly> so then its a problem with your css
[19:33:07] <b1lly> set top to 0
[19:33:08] <b1lly> instead of -1
[19:33:15] <b1lly> top, and see if it works
[19:33:24] <tw2113> barryhjames, $ is not defined
[19:34:03] <PAGO> 0 makes no difference
[19:35:44] <b1lly> PAGO: use jsfiddle.com
[19:35:46] <b1lly> to show me what your doing
[19:36:01] <PAGO> ok sec
[19:36:34] <barryhjames> tw2113: Not sure I follow.
[19:37:12] <barryhjames> tw2113: http://jsbin.com/ezihob/4/edit
[19:37:40] <tw2113> the rest, i dunno
[19:37:52] <tw2113> but from the original version, $ is undefined was the error that showed up in console
[19:40:06] <b1lly> http://jsbin.com/ezihob/3/edit
[19:41:39] <PAGO> is it ok like this http://jsfiddle.net/NmtaV/ ?
[19:43:27] <b1lly> sure
[19:43:40] <barryhjames> b1lly: Awesome!  Thanks so much!
[19:45:38] <b1lly> barryhjames: try putting top
[19:45:41] <b1lly> in ''
[19:45:47] <b1lly> $('.sticky').css({ position: 'fixed', 'top': 0 });
[19:46:02] <b1lly> woops
[19:46:05] <b1lly> i mean PAGO
[19:46:11] <PAGO> hehe
[19:46:42] <coldhead> secrets
[19:47:17] <b1lly> O!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[19:47:22] <b1lly> POOPies
[19:49:40] <PAGO> doesnt work...
[19:50:06] <b1lly> rlY?!
[19:50:34] <PAGO> yes... firefox no problem but safari nothing...
[19:50:58] <b1lly> are you sure you did what I said
[19:50:58] <PAGO> may safari doesnt see the wndow top as firefox does
[19:51:07] <PAGO> yep
[19:52:39] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/NmtaV/12/
[19:52:41] <b1lly> you lie
[19:53:23] <b1lly> OHHHHhhhHHHHHHHh
[19:53:27] <b1lly> I know your problems
[19:55:29] <PAGO> ^^ tell me :)
[19:56:52] <b1lly> no idea
[19:57:02] <PAGO> haha
[19:57:06] <b1lly> you probably have a bug in your markup
[19:57:09] <b1lly> or in your js somewhere
[19:57:16] <b1lly> that firefox is ignoring
[19:57:20] <b1lly> and making things work
[19:57:47] <PAGO> mh sounds bad
[19:57:47] <b1lly> the script itself is fine
[19:57:54] <b1lly> no
[19:57:56] <b1lly> just open your debugger
[19:57:59] <b1lly> and look for errors
[20:00:16] <PAGO> it doesnt show me a sign of bug. i will leave it as it is for now. and thanks b1lly
[20:03:10] <PAGO> the problem is dafari interpretes the code in another way firefox does
[20:12:48] <scalex000> rael, what do you say?
[20:14:40] <scalex000> rael, forum can help you
[20:16:00] <rael> trying to append a list item in treeview with a button, but needs to append to the folder the button is near
[20:16:03] <rael> http://jsfiddle.net/r2c2/6KZJ5/7/
[20:29:02] <tw2113> you're very odd danheberden
[20:47:08] <tw2113> not complaining, just reminding danheberden
[21:06:41] <vacho> $('#canvas_container circle').
[21:06:47] <vacho> how can I get all elements of that and loop through them?
[21:15:10] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/9pUz3tqD
[21:15:16] <vacho> why doesn't that i work???
[21:15:22] <b1lly> because it's in paste bin, DUH
[21:15:28] <vacho> :D
[21:15:30] <vacho> no but seriously.
[21:16:00] <b1lly> k never gets defined
[21:16:12] <vacho> oh, k = i ...
[21:16:14] <vacho> i fixed that.
[21:16:29] <vacho> is is because i is outside the each function?
[21:16:32] <b1lly> what are you trying to do
[21:16:38] <rael> to get a modal form with user input , will jquery ui have what I need?
[21:16:40] <b1lly> create a list of objects?
[21:16:43] <vacho> yes.
[21:16:55] <vacho> im quering the dom, I want to make an array of all the results
[21:17:40] <b1lly> have you ever considered using .push()?
[21:17:55] <tw2113> wouldn't an object of all the dom elements be the same as an array, in the end
[21:18:26] <vacho> no, should I be using push?
[21:20:13] <b1lly> well 2 things actually
[21:20:18] <b1lly> 1 is, is "circle" an element
[21:20:19] <b1lly> or a class
[21:20:28] <b1lly> because you might have screwed up your selector
[21:20:41] <coldhead> very likely

[21:25:04] <vacho> thanks..
[21:25:06] <vacho> why is this not working

[21:25:21] <b1lly> no I have never worked with raphael
[21:25:54] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/w75DrK5R
[21:26:15] <vacho> I am trying to add another attribute..in this  case "sdgsdg"
[21:26:26] <vacho> but it's not getting appended..I also tried .attr('xxx', 'yyyyy');
[21:26:27] <vacho> but no luck
[21:27:11] <b1lly> no clue, probably because paper.rect doesn't return a dom object
[21:28:05] <coldhead> you need canvasQuery
[21:28:26] <b1lly> coldhead: feel like working on a node/canvas project?
[21:28:51] <b1lly> i'm thinking about starting a fun-side project
[21:29:22] <vacho> hmm I see
[21:29:35] <coldhead> i don't work with either of things, b1lly
[21:29:45] <coldhead> but don't let me stop you
[21:29:50] <coldhead> i am too old to learn new tricks
[21:30:02] <b1lly> me neither, I was going to do it as a learning experience
[21:30:10] <b1lly> too old? /slap
[21:30:11] <coldhead> young dog :P
[21:30:43] <b1lly> i'm not that young either
[21:30:53] <coldhead> you're 15 b1lly
[21:30:54] <grafi> poor old people you
[21:30:55] <grafi> oô

[21:31:21] <coldhead> you have your whole life ahead of you
[21:31:29] <b1lly> holy crap
[21:31:31] <coldhead> i barely have the strength to dig my own grave
[21:31:45] <b1lly> I peg you for 25
[21:31:49] <coldhead> i'm just going to try to fall into a wood chipper when my time comes
[21:32:19] <grafi> 1307674368000 seems like an exaggeration b1lly
[21:33:03] <b1lly> I just moved into manhattan
[21:33:07] <b1lly> and I have no couch
[21:33:10] <b1lly> grafi: huh?
[21:33:17] <grafi> 15!
[21:33:18] <b1lly> life without a couch sucks
[21:33:25] <b1lly> did you just timestamp me
[21:33:34] <b1lly> hah
[21:33:38] <grafi> hm that would be funny too
[21:33:53] <b1lly> i'm 25
[21:34:08] <vacho> b1lly: please go to : http://project1.setmedialab.com/ and look in the console log when you click on is connected
[21:34:10] <vacho> if u dont mind
[21:34:21] <vacho> b1lly: getting wrong number
[21:34:36] <coldhead> 25 in manhattan IS 15 elsewhere
[21:34:38] <coldhead> i was so write
[21:34:44] <grafi> b1lly: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=15! ;)
[21:34:57] <coldhead> right*
[21:36:03] <b1lly> vacho: that's because "circle" doesn't exist in the dom
[21:36:43] <vacho> it still loops and find them?
[21:36:45] <b1lly> I take that back
[21:36:46] <vacho> but too many of them.
[21:36:50] <b1lly> what number is wrong
[21:37:01] <b1lly> it seems to work fine
[21:37:05] <vacho> put in 10 nodes... when I query them I get 10 x 10
[21:37:38] <b1lly> 10 nodes? what parameters do I need to put
[21:37:43] <b1lly> # of DG's = 10
[21:37:50] <b1lly> and it dumps about 100+ nodes into my guy
[21:38:26] <b1lly> 90
[21:38:31] <grafi> Request Fullscreen for maximum LSD effect
[21:38:34] <grafi> lolz
[21:38:35] <grafi> <:
[21:39:03] <vacho> b1lly: leave the defaults.. the array does not match the number of nodes for some reason
[21:39:13] <b1lly> the array does match the number of nodes
[21:39:16] <b1lly> I don't know what your talking about
[21:40:17] <b1lly> 90 circles
[21:40:19] <vacho> http://screencast.com/t/kKDhhjvMPa
[21:40:23] <b1lly> and 20 rectangles
[21:41:20] <b1lly> what is a "node"
[21:41:30] <b1lly> in your guy
[21:41:46] <vacho> default
[21:41:46] <b1lly> is it related to the canvas container
[21:41:51] <vacho> 30
[21:41:54] <b1lly> dude
[21:42:00] <b1lly> your canvas_container
[21:42:04] <vacho> ye ssir
[21:42:04] <b1lly> has 110 "nodes"
[21:42:20] <b1lly> ideally, what is supposed to represent
[21:42:22] <b1lly> a node
[21:42:27] <b1lly> what is supposed to match 30
[21:42:34] <vacho> http://screencast.com/t/EIWwcQTeCc
[21:42:40] <vacho> check that out.
[21:42:45] <coldhead> ooh bringing out the big guns
[21:43:03] <vacho> I have 5 nodes in my canvas.. I query them using your function and then do: console.log(nodes.length);
[21:43:10] <vacho> nodes and the array length don't match, and I wonder why.
[21:43:23] <b1lly> I see
[21:43:24] <b1lly> ok one sec
[21:43:51] <b1lly> because
[21:43:54] <b1lly> whoever wrote the damn plugin
[21:43:56] <b1lly> is a retarded
[21:44:10] <vacho> :D
[21:44:29] <b1lly> so
[21:44:32] <b1lly> the red nodes
[21:44:35] <b1lly> are actaully 4 nodes int he markup
[21:44:37] <b1lly> and the white nodes
[21:44:47] <vacho> 4 real??
[21:44:52] <b1lly> are one node
[21:44:54] <b1lly> yeah
[21:45:31] <b1lly> wait
[21:45:31] <b1lly> wtf
[21:45:34] <h6sidhu> guys, I have a blob of data that I want to read as a binarystring. I was using FileReader to do this but it is causing me problems because I need to read about 30 blobs/second and I will get a dom error if the filereader is in a "LOADING" state. Does anyone have any alternative method I can use to convert a blob to binary string?
[21:45:45] <b1lly> idk what you just changed but i refreshed
[21:45:47] <b1lly> and it fixed it
[21:46:06] <b1lly> yeah
[21:46:08] <b1lly> you just fixed it
[21:47:08] <b1lly> h6sidhu: uhm? why are you appending data to the dom that isn't ready?
[21:47:19] <b1lly> h6sidhu: why not just wait until it's fully loaded, and then append it
[21:47:37] <h6sidhu> I'm not appending anything. All I want is my blob to be converted to a binarystring
[21:47:47] <h6sidhu> and stackoverflow told me to use filereader..
[21:48:25] <h6sidhu> also a littl ebit of context
[21:48:33] <h6sidhu> im creating a video streaming app
[21:48:50] <h6sidhu> so I need to call this about 30 times per second.
[21:48:57] <b1lly> just a fyi
[21:49:05] <b1lly> hosting videos is very very very expensive
[21:49:27] <h6sidhu> Ok.. a little bit of more context. I'm hosting videos that are 30 seconds in length.
[21:49:33] <h6sidhu> :)
[21:49:36] <b1lly> streaming to how many viewers
[21:49:39] <b1lly> :)
[21:49:46] <h6sidhu> Im streaming it to my server to save it
[21:49:52] <h6sidhu> and I'm converting it to h264
[21:49:57] <h6sidhu> and other html5 friendly formats
[21:50:07] <b1lly> then you are serving them to who
[21:50:16] <h6sidhu> im serving it to the lovely people on facebook :)
[21:50:22] <b1lly> yeah
[21:50:36] <b1lly> I hope your server can handle a load of viewers downloading and streaming videos
[21:50:52] <h6sidhu> I dont expect my app to go viral
[21:50:57] <h6sidhu> i'm just doing an experiment
[21:50:59] <b1lly> why not just use vimeo
[21:51:02] <b1lly> or youtube
[21:51:04] <b1lly> to host the videos
[21:51:20] <h6sidhu> they wont work
[21:51:24] <h6sidhu> for my use case
[21:51:43] <b1lly> interesting
[21:51:54] <h6sidhu> so is filereader the only way?
[21:52:16] <h6sidhu> cause if it is, ima have to stack them blobs up in a stack of some sort lol
[21:52:24] <h6sidhu> no not stack.. ima have to queue it
[21:52:28] <b1lly> why blobs
[21:52:33] <b1lly> are they coming out of data base
[21:52:49] <h6sidhu> i am taking screenshots of a canvas
[21:52:54] <h6sidhu> which houses my video
[21:53:11] <h6sidhu> I take the dataURI of it
[21:53:14] <h6sidhu> I convert that to a blob
[21:53:19] <h6sidhu> and then to blob-> binarystring
[21:54:20] <o-R-e-N> <imsky> o-R-e-N, use a transform when the field is empty
[21:54:23] <o-R-e-N> Can anyone direct me on how to do this exactly?
[21:54:27] <o-R-e-N> This was my original question:
[21:54:51] <h6sidhu> so filereader is the only way?
[21:54:59] <o-R-e-N> <o-R-e-N> i just want placeholder with no transformation, but when a user starts to type in the box, it is in uppercase.
[21:56:43] <o-R-e-N> At the moment, I can't get this all to work :/ It's simply an input box (search) with a placeholder... The placeholder is not in uppercase, but I would like what the user types to be uppercase.
[21:57:27] <o-R-e-N> At best, I can get it to work in Safari only... in Firefox/IE, the text-transformation css is ignored.
[21:58:27] <o-R-e-N> And I'm trying with the prefixes -- e.g.: .form-wrapper input:-moz-placeholder {
[21:58:29] <tw2113> o-R-e-N, http://jsbin.com/imogix/1/edit
[21:58:35] <o-R-e-N> Thanks, checking now!
[21:58:49] <tw2113> it's working in firefox aurora
[21:59:01] <tw2113> placeholder is lowercase, typed in text upper
[22:04:12] <o-R-e-N> Gotta be something else wrong with my code :(
[22:04:16] <o-R-e-N> .form-wrapper input[type="text"] {
[22:04:17] <o-R-e-N> text-transform: uppercase;
[22:04:28] <o-R-e-N> for some reason makes the placeholder uppercase too
[22:05:00] <tw2113> set the same specificity but add in the placeholder selectors
[22:05:12] <tw2113> .form-wrapper ::moz-placeholder-whatever {}
[22:05:45] <o-R-e-N> k
[22:07:46] <o-R-e-N> Thanks btw, tw2113
[22:08:03] <tw2113> don't thank me until a solution is found
[22:08:15] <o-R-e-N> And sorry for being annoying, but what is going in the "-whatever" spot again?
[22:08:23] <o-R-e-N> lol, okay
[22:08:25] <tw2113> whatever was in my jsbin
[22:08:30] <o-R-e-N> k
[22:08:30] <tw2113> for the selectors
[22:08:49] <o-R-e-N> I got .form-wrapper ::-moz-placeholder {
[22:10:46] <peterz33> how would I go about posting a javascript array using ajax post??
[22:13:59] <o-R-e-N> grrr, only working in Safari, tw2113!
[22:14:48] <o-R-e-N> I'm wondering if some other css code is overriding it or something (editing a wordpress theme)
[22:22:20] <morsik> hi, any admin from jquery.com site here?
[22:22:33] <morsik> (and others in topic)
[22:31:51] <b1lly> o-R-e-N: what only works in safari?
[22:34:44] <o-R-e-N> b1lly: I have an input box (search) with a placeholder that says "Enter your ref. ID" -- and I am trying to style the box so that when the user types the ID, it will be all uppercase
[22:35:28] <o-R-e-N> But nothing I'm trying is doing it right in Firefox/IE
[22:36:15] <o-R-e-N> Even with the vendor prefixes :(
[22:36:22] <b1lly> yeah well
[22:36:24] <b1lly> thats because css doesn
[22:36:28] <b1lly> doesn't listen for change
[22:37:05] <o-R-e-N> Hmm. That kinda makes sense...
[22:37:44] <o-R-e-N> So is there no way to do this? -- it seems a user here almost had it:
[22:37:47] <o-R-e-N> http://jsbin.com/imogix/1/edit
[22:37:52] <b1lly> yeah theres a way
[22:38:08] <b1lly> you want
[22:38:09] <o-R-e-N> But I couldn't even get the above to work with my content
[22:38:20] <b1lly> it to transform what the user input is
[22:38:22] <b1lly> or the placeholder?
[22:38:28] <o-R-e-N> user input
[22:39:21] <b1lly> what browsers did you test it in?
[22:39:21] <shoky> o-R-e-N obviously there's a way to do it, that jsbin works
[22:40:06] <o-R-e-N> yeah, shoky, i smirked at the question after i typed it, lol.
[22:40:19] <o-R-e-N> b1lly: tested in Safari, Firefox, IE
[22:40:30] <b1lly> firefox and ie doesn't work?
[22:40:32] <shoky> o-R-e-N you won't get help if you dont give more details or show exactly what you're doing
[22:40:34] <ohno`> how do I hack
[22:40:42] <shoky> because your question has been answered fully
[22:41:10] <shoky> make it not work in the jsbin like it doesnt work in your site
[22:41:20] <ohno`> HOW do I HACK!
[22:41:22] <shoky> so we can see wtf you're talking about
[22:41:39] <ohno`> i'm trying to break into this compuder, and found a few open ports and need some advice
[22:41:41] <ohno`> how do i hack?
[22:41:41] <o-R-e-N> shoky, thanks, but I'm giving more info as it's asked for. b1lly is helping now, others like you, won't bother; and that's fine.
[22:42:16] <ohno`> HOW do I HACK!

[23:00:19] <Error404NotFound> I have an <a class='something' href='url.here'><span>Link Text</span></a>.

I tried (event.target.nodeName == 'A')? event.target: event.target.parent(); but thats no use...

[23:02:01] <coldhead> it's fucking shakespeare, mate
[23:02:04] <Error404NotFound> b1lly: almost. <span> doesn't have attr() so kind of 404 on method attr()

[23:02:36] <b1lly> Error404NotFound: so your trying to bind an event listener on the a/
[23:02:39] <Error404NotFound> b1lly: my point still validates.
[23:02:46] <Error404NotFound> b1lly: true.
[23:02:48] <coldhead> eh close enough
[23:02:54] <b1lly> $('a.something').click(function() { // do stuff });

[23:03:21] <tw2113> it's now 1am
[23:03:25] <Error404NotFound> b1lly: hmmm... let me think why i didn't do it. there was something else i think.
[23:03:58] <b1lly> think about it, let me know
[23:05:22] <b1lly> where there are bees, there are boos
[23:05:30] <Error404NotFound> b1lly: even if event is bound on a.something event.target could be span. There are multiple <a> with class 'something' so i can bind it to <a>'s id.
[23:05:32] <b1lly> you can quote me on that
[23:05:44] <b1lly> Error404NotFound: I think your confusing yourself
[23:05:55] <tw2113> you can act on the context of the clicked element
[23:06:33] <Error404NotFound> hmmm
[23:06:35] <b1lly> BOOBEES, get it old timer?
[23:06:46] <Error404NotFound> tw2113: how?
[23:07:19] <tw2113> $(.something).on('click',function(){ $(this).css(); });
[23:07:23] <tw2113> for a quick example
[23:07:26] <b1lly> $('a.something').click(function() { console.log ($(this).href) });
[23:07:40] <tw2113> or what b1lly said

[23:21:53] <Error404NotFound> actually figured it out
[23:21:57] <Error404NotFound> tw2113: thanks
[23:23:28] <Error404NotFound> btw, whats the difference in $this and $(this)? $this should be the object on which handler is running on. $(this) using $this as a selector?
[23:36:17] <Cork> Error404NotFound: $this doesn't exist unless you create it
[23:36:29] <Cork> Error404NotFound: its just a normal javascript variable
[23:36:51] <Cork> (you prob have a var $this = $(this); )
[23:37:37] <Error404NotFound> hmmm
[23:41:26] <Zombie_> Hello
[23:41:41] <Zombie_> Any brains out there?
[23:43:43] <Cork> Zombie_: just ask the question
[23:44:56] <Error404NotFound> Inside an event handler whats the difference between "this" and "event.target"? "event.target" remains to what caused the event while "this" changes everytime to event.currentTarget?
[23:45:25] <tw2113> this would be in context to the element you clicked
[23:45:56] <Cork> Error404NotFound: this is the element you targeted with the event listener, event.target is what element the event initialized on
[23:46:15] <Error404NotFound> Cork: tw2113: thanks again
[23:46:20] <Error404NotFound> one more concept cleared.
[23:46:31] <Cork> ex. $(document).on('click', 'a') will have this as the a element as this
[23:46:48] <Cork> while $(document).on('click') will have document
[23:47:41] <Error404NotFound> hmmm
[23:47:42] <Error404NotFound> cool
