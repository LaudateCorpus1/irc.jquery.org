[01:09:14] <wa5ted> shoky: you around foudn your name on  a stackoverflow page :) http://stackoverflow.com/a/21104927
[01:11:58] <shoky> wa5ted: hah nice
[01:12:12] <wa5ted> how aare things
[01:13:05] <shoky> meh, can't fall asleep cause upstairs neighbour is cleaning or something :\  nasty dragging noises. waiting it out. sup :)
[01:21:13] <wa5ted> shoky: nothing much, developing a cool new project so trying to get this one finished for once unlike my once upon mind map idea you helped me with ;)
[01:26:36] <shoky> what is it?
[01:28:20] <wa5ted> shoky: it has to do with a different way of looking at a portfolio (eg. a designer) in a compact view
[01:29:49] <shoky> cool
[04:46:46] <HeavenSucks> is it right to use only one $(documen).ready() in a core javascript file
[04:51:01] <shoky> HeavenSucks: sure. if you just include your script at the end of <body> then you don't need any $(document).ready at all
[05:00:34] <HeavenSucks> shoky: so I need to just remove $(document).ready and use the functions?
[05:01:07] <shoky> use the functions?
[05:01:41] <HeavenSucks> shoky: I mean, my function
[05:01:45] <arup_r> Say, I have a form. And I want to prevent submit by user when the form fields are not filled. How to do so ?
[05:02:17] <shoky> donno what using it means. if you put your script at the end of <body>  you don't need any $(document).ready , you can just put your code in the script without it
[05:02:30] <HeavenSucks> shoky: Okey, thanks
[05:03:44] <arup_r> Currently I have a form with a file input field and a description field. But, I have no check if the form is being submitted without data or not.. Should I do it in backend or frontend. I know how to do in backend, but no idea about frontend
[05:04:50] <shoky> arup_r: you should always validate on backend, even if you also do it on frontend.  on frontend you can use a validation library or you can listen for the form's submit event and call e.preventDefault() on the event argument to prevent the submit
[05:05:55] <arup_r> shoky: yea, but how do I check the file field value is empty or not ? This is what I am not getting
[05:06:17] <shoky> check its value, e.g. with .val()
[05:07:20] <arup_r> ok.
[05:40:57] <empedokles78_> Am I doing anything wrong here, or why is the example of this timepicker not working?: https://jsfiddle.net/rnr2wgv6/5/
[05:47:40] <manners13> hey guys i have a page that creates forms for emails each with a different attachment and a seperate submit button on each form. i would like to have a send all button at the bottom that goes down the page submitting each form one by one
[05:48:01] <manners13> is this possible with jquery and can anyone point me in the right direction for me to go research
[07:44:40] <KnightsOfNi> When using jquery's load(url) to load content in a div, it only shows after everything on the page is loaded. Is there a way to display the content gradually?
[07:59:33] <jquery965> Hey guys! Anyone here got a sec?
[07:59:51] <jquery965> I am experiencing a really wierd problem right now
[08:00:18] <jquery965> http://pastebin.com/QGEESeKC
[08:00:19] <jquery965> So here
[08:00:44] <jquery965> my console log is logging the dom returned by the server, while I do have a api route there
[08:00:56] <jquery965> though I have configured my webroutes as following
[08:01:02] <jquery965> "*" render view
[09:17:07] <alturic> Hey guys, I'm looking for a way to tweak my current code (http://pastebin.com/raw/m8PHRKC0) but be able to make the dateregion var "unique" per the data var. The way it stands, regardless of the data var selected, if it contains something in the dataregion var it uses both values. So if you look at "500mb_height" as an example, in a simplistic way, I'm looking to do something to where "gfs"
[09:17:07] <alturic> has it's own 500mb_height since the "gfs" one wouldn't contain both CONUS and EUROPE. I can't figure out a way that can allow me to get that to work. :-/
[11:50:59] <empedokles78_> What's wrong with: "<script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/jquery.timepicker.min.js') }}"></script>" ?
[11:54:34] <rcyr> Ask your backend dev.
[12:51:27] <BenderRodriguez> hm
[13:19:38] <DexDeadly_2> If I have a page that dynamically generates multiple forms is there a way to submit each form

[13:45:00] <Cork> DexDeadly_2: $('form').trigger('submit')
[15:40:56] <chingyy938> Hi guys, what is the correct way to include 2 variables in this?   $("#textbox2").val(textinput) + (str);
[15:42:43] <chingyy938> fixed, np
[16:09:05] <DexDeadly> Heres a question.  I have text boxes where users can place in a money amount, however I do have a field where there is a max amount that it can be.  Can I dynamically check this
[16:09:51] <DexDeadly> so as soon as they type in a number that is over that amount it alerts them.
[16:10:05] <wa5ted> DexDeadly: you can use a input type number no?
[16:10:06] <DexDeadly> Here is the other kicker the amount is different for each form
[16:10:17] <wa5ted> and set its min and max value
[16:10:17] <DexDeadly> there are multiple forms on the page
[16:10:33] <wa5ted> it wont alert the user just prevent them from typing anything bigger
[16:10:47] <DexDeadly> the form is generated in a php for loop
[16:11:03] <DexDeadly> hmmm
[16:11:07] <chingyy938> Hi guys, i'd like to implement this builder into my site, do you know which javascript/jquery bits to include in my page? https://raventools.com/gaconfig/google-analytics-url-builder/
[16:17:27] <empedokles78_> What would you use for geocoding?
[16:25:06] <DexDeadly> wa5ted what about if there is multiple forms on the page and each form has a different value
[16:25:28] <wa5ted> the stuff im talkign about goes direclty on the input
[16:26:33] <DexDeadly> so your saying max=value
[16:27:28] <DexDeadly> example <input type="text" max=<?php echo $game_data['max_wager']; name="wager" ?>
[16:40:32] <DexDeadly> this just makes the value 0 and still submits, is there not a way to not allow the form to submit if its not within the values
[17:20:50] <xenaxon> hi
[17:20:55] <xenaxon> I'm having a problem
[17:21:21] <xenaxon> 	jQuery(".theTitle a").each(function (index) { 		console.log(jQuery(this).attr("href")); 	});
[17:21:37] <xenaxon> this should return a string oh HREF, but instead it's returning an object containing the anchors!
[17:22:00] <xenaxon> how to fix this??
[17:24:25] <xenaxon> can someone help me?
[17:26:24] <rcyr> Let's start from the beginning, what are you trying to do?
[17:27:35] <xenaxon> just looping through anchors
[17:27:42] <xenaxon> and want to get the hrefs
[17:28:05] <xenaxon> simple task, but I am expecting a string back, and I'm getting an object
[17:28:31] <Kartagis> jsfiddle
[17:28:32] <xenaxon> shouldnt attr('href') return a string?
[17:29:35] <Kartagis> it does for me
[17:29:50] <Kartagis> make a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[17:30:09] <xenaxon> https://jsfiddle.net/yqyg8fvh/3/
[17:31:10] <Kartagis> it does
[17:33:46] <xenaxon> it does what/
[17:33:46] <xenaxon> ?
[17:59:18] <Kartagis> xenaxon: it does work
[17:59:43] <Kartagis> https://jsfiddle.net/yqyg8fvh/5/
[17:59:44] <xenaxon> Kartagis: I had logging unchecked
[17:59:51] <xenaxon> Kartagis: noob mistake :)))
[18:00:19] <Kartagis> that happens
[19:21:48] <hmnrbt> Hey all!  Anybody available to help me with an issue I'm having on a shopify site?
[19:22:56] <hmnrbt> I modified the product-zoom feature to take up the entire webpage, but panning the picture up and down is limited to the size of the thumbnail.
[19:23:15] <hmnrbt> I've been trying to figure it out, I feel like it would be easy for someone who is more familiar with jquery and javascript
[19:56:05] <DexDeadly> can I cycle through submitting multiple forms on a generated page
[20:54:51] <DexDeadly>  ok, wrote a function that checks if a value of a field is higher then an allowed value.  It pops and alert stating so.  My question is cause I clear just that field not the entire form or change it red? Possibly both
