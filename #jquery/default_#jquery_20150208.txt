[00:05:31] <gtristan> can jquery animate colors by itself, or does it need jqueryui for that ?
[00:41:59] <boodllebat> Hello i made a small Ajax plugin can i show it here ?
[00:47:27] <MagePsycho> which cheatsheet you guys use for jQuery?
[01:53:27] <gtristan> Am I setting the disabled state properly with jquery here: http://jsfiddle.net/mvq7unux/ ?
[01:53:38] <gtristan> For some reason the :hover state insists on showing up
[01:59:07] <The_Phoenix> How would I do something like $('selector').attr('some attribute', selectedItem.text())? How do I refer to selected item? this doesn't seem to be working.
[02:04:14] <The_Phoenix> I guess I'll go with each.
[02:05:56] <Meir`> The_Phoenix, you probably mean $(this)
[02:14:09] <Meir`> The_Phoenix, here is an example fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3044ue8s/
[02:15:06] <Meir`> this will set a custom attribute ('data-custom') of the selected item (<p>) to the value of its inner text ('Hello')
[02:18:54] <Meir`> gtristan, what excatly are you trying to disable?
[02:19:02] <Meir`> and when...
[02:21:22] <gtristan> Meir`, the <div> which gets :focus, apparently that's not allowed... only some elements which consider themselves special, can be disabled
[02:21:31] <gtristan> you know, classic story of how horrible the DOM is
[02:24:04] <Meir`> you want it not to be editable?
[02:24:30] <Meir`> gtristan ^
[02:26:34] <The_Phoenix> I can't get a span's title. Neither .attr('title') or .prop('title') work. .text() works. So, that implies my selector is working.
[02:27:00] <gtristan> Meir`, nah, it was all about :focus
[02:27:37] <gtristan> Meir`, I have a solution now, which involves an extra 'my-enabled' css class, on which I only apply to the element when the editable label is enabled
[02:27:40] <Meir`> The_Phoenix, please provide some fiddle
[02:27:49] <gtristan> and only apply the :focus class to .my-class.my-enabled
[02:29:04] <Meir`> gtristan, sorry but i still didn't understand what you're trying to do :)
[02:29:46] <The_Phoenix> Meir`: Am not sure. The fully functional page is a bit large. Let me try.
[02:31:12] <gtristan> Meir`, I have this editable label thing right, which is in the fiddle... but you can only edit it when your UI is in "Edit Mode"
[02:31:15] <gtristan> basically
[02:31:34] <gtristan> and I was trying to avoid the :focus state and events by simply setting the <div> as 'disabled'
[02:31:57] <gtristan> but divs dont like that, so hackery ensues
[02:33:16] <The_Phoenix> Interesting. Fiddle works.
[02:35:33] <boodllebat> gtristan: Hello i wrote a minimal JS plugin can i show it here ?
[02:35:58] <gtristan> boodllebat, I dont know why you are asking me
[02:36:38] <boodllebat> gtristan: i'm asking , can posting link to my plugin will considerd as spam ?
[02:38:32] <gtristan> boodllebat, posting a link and asking for comments I would not consider spam, and I think you are safe from the spambots
[02:39:04] <gtristan> boodllebat, honestly I dont moderate this channel so your question is probably misdirected, my opinion is not the opinion of everyone
[02:39:44] <boodllebat> gtristan: here is what i wrote http://argunner.github.io/minAjax.js/
[02:47:20] <boodllebat> gtristan: what do you think ?
[02:53:34] <gtristan> boodllebat, I dont know, I am also working 12 hours a day on my own thing you know...
[02:53:57] <boodllebat> gtristan: no problem :)
[02:54:03] <gtristan> not like I have that much space for code review, got a specific question ? maybe I or someone else can answer if you ask concisely :)
[03:34:42] <MagePsycho> which jquery cheatsheet you guys use?
[03:38:18] <sacho> the jquery documentation
[03:50:53] <gtristan> How do you got the index of a child in it's parent ?
[03:51:58] <gtristan> lets say I already have a children = $(parent).children() variable (cause I need that anyway)... does it help ?
[03:52:58] <gtristan> ah, .index() seems to be it, without arguments
[03:53:40] <gtristan> will it return a nice and useful -1 for an element not in a parent yet ?
[03:53:52] <gtristan> bah, not important
[04:11:05] <nickse> Can you see anything wrong with this line?
[04:11:06] <nickse> $('.menu-items tr:last').after(templateItem).removeClass('item-row-template').addClass('item-row'‌​);
[04:16:24] <robuster> Hi, is anyone familar with the Footable addons?
[04:16:27] <robuster> Like pagination & filter?
[06:39:20] <CoffeeMarker> hey
[06:39:33] <CoffeeMarker> I want to hide all elements with a certain class besides one
[06:39:38] <CoffeeMarker> $('.particle').is(":visible").not($('.particle').is(":visible").first()).hide();
[06:39:44] <CoffeeMarker> doesnt seem to work
[06:50:07] <Meir`> CoffeeMarker, i'm not sure but try this: $(".particle:visible:not(:first)").hide();
[06:51:30] <CoffeeMarker> that works, thx
[06:54:00] <Meir`> CoffeeMarker, according to jquery notes, you better use .filter(":visible")
[06:54:11] <Meir`> (maybe that's why .is() didn't work)
[06:54:54] <CoffeeMarker> you're right that also works
[06:55:39] <Meir`> that is best pattern: $(".particle").filter(":visible").not(":first")
[06:56:32] <CoffeeMarker> that one actually doesnt seem to work
[06:56:41] <Meir`> lol
[06:56:55] <CoffeeMarker> $('.particle').filter(":visible").not($('.particle').filter(":visible").first()) works fine
[06:57:38] <Meir`> what about .not(":eq(0)")
[06:57:40] <Meir`> ?
[07:00:08] <CoffeeMarker> seems to work
[07:00:20] <CoffeeMarker> sorry my bad, seems the previous one also works
[07:00:29] <CoffeeMarker> the not(":first") one
[07:01:04] <Meir`> great :)
[07:01:39] <Meir`> sorry i suggested without testing myself
[07:01:41] <Meir`> i'm not on pc
[08:59:48] <Yatekii> guys, I have this code but it never executes done() ... what could be my mistake, or how can I debug it properly? :S
[08:59:50] <Yatekii> http://codepad.org/kLRl4Ylq
[09:21:34] <Respek> Could anyone tell me why might the $ not work, while the word jQuery does?
[09:21:49] <Respek> I'm debugging an issue, and for some reason the $ alias is not working
[09:23:22] <Respek> well, it says undefined upon entering $ into console
[10:15:01] <shoky> Respek: could be some code you have included is calling jQuery.noConflict() or is redefining the global $
[10:15:37] <Respek> thanks shoky , I'll look into that as a possibility
[10:36:28] <ThePendulum> Hey. I have two tabs that I'm using jQuery for to switch between; http://pastie.org/private/jru5syatkjomlip5wyswqg
[10:36:39] <ThePendulum> I was wondering if there's a more efficient method to switch between two tabs and change some attributes
[10:36:56] <ThePendulum> http://memody.com:3000/chat.html <-- live example, top right
[10:42:06] <ThePendulum> I'm also trying to prevent a form from submitting
[10:42:13] <ThePendulum> return false; works for one form, but not the other, strangely
[10:45:43] <ThePendulum> nvm fixed that
[12:25:18] <apb1963> I have multiple forms.  I want to submit all form data with one button.  The button is outside all of the forms.
[12:25:20] <apb1963> So, how do I access the form data, if my button is not in my form?
[12:34:41] <frabblerock> HEY
[13:08:05] <zagaza> hi.. can someone help me out here? http://jsfiddle.net/mkm0d0x8/6/  when you click the hamburger icon and click the back button, it closes.. but when you click the hamburger twice, I can't make it close
[13:09:22] <kukosk> is there any reason jQuery should append a 'pre' tag instead of an 'object' tag when using append(object) ? (svg)
[13:36:13] <Filystyn> hello
[13:36:29] <Filystyn> i was bashe dfrom html  here
[13:36:40] <Filystyn> since  jquerry has nothign to do with html
[13:36:43] <Filystyn> Q:
[13:40:26] <Filystyn> http://pastebin.com/hyXuW76m
[13:40:30] <Filystyn> what mistake im doing?
[13:44:36] <Filystyn> HELLLOOOOOO
[13:44:39] <Filystyn> ^
[13:48:30] <FilipNortic> fadeOut has a big O
[13:49:27] <FilipNortic> Filystyn: you should add a ; after the last ) also
[13:49:58] <Filystyn> ok
[13:50:55] <Filystyn> ok it doesnt work im doing it on disc not on web meaby it is the problem?
[13:51:42] <Filystyn> http://pastebin.com/nZRn1aYz
[13:52:41] <FilipNortic> Filystyn:
[13:52:57] <FilipNortic> oh you need quotes around 5000
[13:53:02] <Filystyn> !
[13:53:02] <FilipNortic> '5000'
[13:53:04] <Velveeta> seems to work for me as written: http://jsfiddle.net/gtqvnkwg/
[13:53:24] <Velveeta> the duration can be either a number or string
[13:53:38] <Velveeta> the string functionality is meant to be something like 'slow' or 'fast'
[13:54:13] <FilipNortic> Velveeta: I think that depends on jQuery version
[13:54:29] <Velveeta> the docs show it since v1.0
[13:54:42] <Filystyn> sec
[13:54:59] <Filystyn> might that be possible i dont have jquerry?
[13:55:06] <Filystyn> installed
[13:55:12] <Velveeta> are you getting console errors that say that?
[13:55:36] <Filystyn> no console errors
[13:55:42] <Filystyn> just the  div does not fade away
[13:55:49] <Velveeta> is this your own page you're working on?
[13:56:00] <Filystyn> its a page on my disc its not on the web
[13:56:07] <Filystyn> i simply made  html js and css files
[13:56:10] <Filystyn> and linke dthe,m
[13:56:14] <Velveeta> and you don't know if you have jquery in it or not?
[13:56:14] <Filystyn> linked them*
[13:56:31] <Filystyn> im trying to use jquerry first time in my life
[13:56:47] <Filystyn> never did it befor so i might be missing some realy basic thing
[13:57:49] <Velveeta> you need to first make sure you've downloaded jquery to somewhere in your site's folders
[13:58:04] <Velveeta> then add a script tag to your html file to add that resource to the page
[13:58:35] <Velveeta> or you could load it from some cdn without having to download it to disk
[13:58:48] <Velveeta> but at a minimum, you need to add a script tag to your document to have it included in the page
[13:59:05] <Filystyn> http://pastebin.com/g9qNwhTn
[13:59:42] <Velveeta> yeah, you're not loading jquery in that page, just your own js file
[13:59:49] <Velveeta> start here: http://encosia.com/3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you/
[14:00:01] <Velveeta> that'll show you how to load it from a cdn, as well as explaining why you might want to
[14:00:28] <Filystyn> ok thank you
[14:05:21] <d[^_^]b> when i load my page which is formatted using javascript i can see some of the hidden div before they are actually hidden
[14:05:46] <d[^_^]b> why does that happen?
[14:06:28] <d[^_^]b> the hidden portion is actually inline so it makes less sense
[14:06:38] <Woet> d[^_^]b: reproduce it on www.jsfiddle.net
[14:06:47] <d[^_^]b> it's very hard because it's a giant suite
[14:08:10] <Filystyn> ok guys i added line "<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>"    is that a good practic?
[14:08:36] <Filystyn> it works
[14:08:43] <Filystyn> but meaby i should not do it thsi way
[14:08:52] <Filystyn> meaby its a bad habbit?
[14:09:35] <systemfault> It's fine to load jquery off their CDN... but it's not fine to load jquery-latest
[14:09:40] <systemfault> Load a specific version
[14:10:00] <Filystyn> ok
[15:36:10] <compact> hi, every event that I try on my webpage. i get the following error in console: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'click' of null
[15:36:19] <compact> however "click" will change to "hide" etc
[15:37:48] <dismist> man that shits happening to me in my regular firefox firebug
[15:38:10] <dismist> on scripts that were previously working.  try chrome... chrome would run silent in the console for me on the same pages i was having that annoying problem
[15:38:21] <compact> i am using chrome
[15:38:24] <dismist> it scrolls FAST too right? nearly 5 a second or so right?
[15:38:42] <compact> dismist, you talking to me?
[15:38:43] <dismist> or maybe that all depends on your own looping function
[15:38:51] <dismist> but i think mine was reporting jquery as being the error
[15:40:06] <dismist> listen... im thinkin out loud tryin to solve a problem that i bet 70% of this channel couldn't.  if u care to tune your black ass into the broadcast and either marvel at the problem solvin show or contribute your helping efforts, i would be open to such an arrangement
[15:40:22] <dismist> but where do you get off feeling like you need to talk to me that way?
[16:21:25] <compact> $('.new_row').click(function()

[18:46:35] <Woet> please don't
[18:47:20] <d[^_^]b> oh, i'm sorry
[18:47:27] <d[^_^]b> does PM break your system somehow?

[19:05:47] <d[^_^]b> here's the solution i needed
[19:17:30] <d[^_^]b> it worked great, wow, that's something i've wanted to fix for a year.
[19:17:35] <d[^_^]b> :D
[20:44:39] <aro> is there a way to use defer to defer submission of  a form, so i can preserve what button was clicked to submit it?
[20:57:04] <cluelessperson> Hey guys,  I have an iframe, that when it loads    onload=""   I need the parent frame/window's  url to reflect its location/target    parent.com/files?frame=directory
[20:57:07] <cluelessperson> does anyone know how to do this?
[20:59:28] <gtristan> aro, you can probably do it a few ways, you can set <button type="button">, the 'type' will ensure that the thing does not go submitting forms all by itself
[21:00:18] <gtristan> aro, personally I think I will change my own approach to install some event handler on $(document) and preventDefault() from there, so that no rampant inputs and entries ever randomly submit forms ever again
[21:00:48] <gtristan> (not sure that works, but I have my hopes)
[21:28:15] <yellow_paper> Hows it going guys?
[21:44:37] <cluelessperson> yellowbig,   not too bad, how about for you?

[23:29:13] <Unopoo> hello? any one here still breathing?
[23:29:23] <Woet> nope
[23:29:56] <Unopoo> Woet: hey you, do you have the time to help there?
[23:30:53] <Uhkis> Unopoo: just ask, someone may or may not answer
[23:31:04] <Unopoo> Uhkis: I asked...
[23:31:13] <Unopoo> http://jsfiddle.net/n5ob4eus/
[23:31:20] <Meir`> [07:45:55] <Unopoo> http://jsfiddle.net/n5ob4eus/
[23:31:20] <Meir`> [07:46:06] <Unopoo> why the #searchForm won't submit?
[23:31:37] <Unopoo> I use .submit() to submit #searchForm, but don't know why it doesn't work
[23:31:47] <Meir`> first tell us what value did you insert in "requestMonth"
[23:31:59] <Unopoo> 2014-11
[23:32:06] <Unopoo> the regexp test is true
[23:32:13] <Unopoo> so that should be excuting
[23:33:42] <Meir`> Unopoo, it does enter into the submit part of the if
[23:34:14] <Unopoo> Meir`: yes, I see the result in console
[23:35:41] <Cork> Unopoo: you should check the values and do the preventDefault() conditionally instead of faking a submit event
[23:36:01] <Cork> browsers form features will break with this solution
[23:36:13] <Cork> or rather some browsers form features will break
[23:37:15] <Meir`> and i think it's more common to bind to the submit event
[23:37:29] <Cork> that was kinda implied ya
[23:37:29] <Meir`> $( "#searchForm" ).submit(function() { ... }
[23:38:02] <Unopoo> Cork: you mean I should firstly check the result of the regexp then dicide if to .preventDefault?
[23:38:06] <Unopoo> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/n5ob4eus/1/?
[23:38:08] <Cork> Unopoo: http://jsfiddle.net/n5ob4eus/2/
[23:39:25] <Meir`> Cork, isn't it more clear to add a "return;" command?
[23:39:36] <Meir`> in a "else" perhaps
[23:39:39] <Cork> you mean return false;?
[23:39:48] <Meir`> no, in case of valid input
[23:39:54] <Meir`> an empty "return"
[23:40:02] <Cork> not really
[23:40:04] <Meir`> (or return true)
[23:40:09] <Unopoo> Cork: thank you
[23:40:13] <Cork> you would still have to use the if statement
[23:40:15] <Unopoo> problem solved
