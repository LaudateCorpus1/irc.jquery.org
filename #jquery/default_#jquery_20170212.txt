[03:01:08] <jQuesty> Dear #jQuery. I know, ajax does not work for content on external domains/ports. However, I need a way to check if a server is offline or online. It works nicely with jQuery ajax statusCode. But the server only exposes port 8088, so how can I check if it's online/offline without running into CORS issues? Here is the working fiddle exemplary: https://jsfiddle.net/0y19nv44/
[03:14:55] <jQuesty> It seems I rather solve checking wether a server is online/offline but only exposes different port(s) using php (fsockopen). That works.
[03:15:44] <jQuesty> Hopefully adding those keywords helps some seeking gentleman in the future :-) Bye all

[14:36:48] <xenaxon> hi
[14:36:58] <xenaxon> is there any lightweight alternative to jquery accordion
[14:37:20] <xenaxon> I need to use accordion on dynamically added divs, at the same time having sortable on them
[16:11:09] <tucan> hi i'm using jquery ui simply for the autocomplete, is that stupid to do that?
[16:11:42] <tucan> can someone link me to a good solution that doesnt use jquery ui
[16:12:06] <tucan> search form/autocomplete
[16:28:01] <rhizome> tucan: i wrote one from scratch in regular jquery when I didn't know anything. create a query method/api on the backend and read up on jquery keyup() and related methods. there are also jq-without-jqui autocomplete plugins.
[16:35:23] <SpecialTech> Why won't it hide the "arrow" https://jsfiddle.net/ufx9uosr/
[17:10:38] <tucan> rhizome: can you link or paste a decent solution? i have no idea whats good
[17:18:37] <Shazer[2]> Hi all. I have an issue where I'm adding elements to the DOM dynamically so the JS/jQuery loaded on page load doesn't get applied to these elements. Apart from the obvious use of $.on(), is there any other solution?
[17:27:32] <shoky_> Shazer[2]: assuming you're talking about event handlers.. either attach them after the elements exist, or use event delegation with .on()
[17:29:49] <Shazer[2]> shoky_: yeah, the problem is I have some external libraries and stuff I'm using like datepicker and popovers etc
[17:30:25] <shoky_> Shazer[2]: then you must initialize them after the elements exist in the DOM.. no other solution
[17:31:42] <Shazer[2]> shoky_: yep thought that might be the case, just trying to think of how to do so.
[17:31:46] <Shazer[2]> shoky_: thanks :)
[17:32:19] <shoky_> np
[17:59:22] <SpecialTech> shoky_ hopefully this isn't a both, but does something like this exist? 	 $(this).parent().removeClass('[class^="open-"]'); (Trying to remove a class based on click)
[18:05:47] <SpecialTech> nvm found it
