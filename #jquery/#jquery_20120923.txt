[05:44:44] <alket> Hi, where to add -30px in here: ($(window).scrollTop() == $(document).height() - $(window).height())
[05:45:54] <hey> just learning and trying to get used to jquery can someone help with this small snippet
[05:45:57] <hey> http://jsfiddle.net/w7E7c/
[05:46:36] <hey> dunno who the link isnt shifting to the right. i used console.log() in chrome to check if the value comes out as 15px and it does so I dunno why it doesnt work
[05:47:12] <hey> wait nevermind
[05:47:24] <hey> ...just noticed a missing period after looking at this for half an hour....
[05:48:07] <hey> i always get stuck on the little mistakes >_<
[05:49:09] <Solow> Hia. I want to start using requireJS, but I'm now noticing how difficult this is to combine with let's say jquery ui....
[05:49:13] <Solow> Any suggestions?
[05:58:38] <jarr0dsz> stupid question maybe but can you have a link and tie an jquery action to it? while keeping a regular link?
[05:58:52] <jarr0dsz> so the user clicks gets linked to new page but also a custom function is triggered?
[05:59:15] <jarr0dsz> i need to redirect a user and its most important that he is indeed redirected, worry about jquery redirect might causing issues, or is that ungrounded?
[06:02:08] <victorbjelkholm> jarr0dsz, if you absolutely need to redirect, don't use Javascript
[06:02:33] <jarr0dsz> i now have a link like "#" with an onclick event so it triggers my function
[06:02:37] <jarr0dsz> just wondered if I could have both?
[06:02:44] <jarr0dsz> so like "/linkto" and then an onclick event
[06:03:46] <victorbjelkholm> so you want to leave the page for /linkto and then fire of a event?
[06:04:25] <jarr0dsz> yes thats the idea :)
[06:04:49] <jarr0dsz> i know i can do a document.location redirect in my custom function but this should definitly work across all browsers
[06:06:35] <victorbjelkholm> but if you
[06:06:40] <Lucky--> jarr0dsz: an application of sorts?
[06:06:52] <victorbjelkholm> jarr0dsz, if you're leaving the page, how could the event be fired?
[06:07:14] <Lucky--> window.location
[06:07:24] <jarr0dsz> window.location yes i just use that for now i probably think to complicated
[06:07:33] <jarr0dsz> window.location would be cross browser wouden't it
[06:07:42] <Lucky--> jarr0dsz: is this for some sort of lead gen by chance?
[06:07:57] <jarr0dsz> lead gen? no its for my rails application
[06:10:37] <Biomech> before i get in to (later) is there any common bug/reason why a jquery fadein doesn't work in IE? $('#quickContactNoticeBox').hide().fadeIn(2500);
[06:10:47] <Biomech> maybe i need to set the height of the container or something?
[06:15:46] <SomeoneWeird> maybe because its IE
[06:17:14] <Lucky--> thats the catch all answer
[06:17:19] <Lucky--> kinda like the catch all email box
[06:17:24] <Lucky--> but the catch all cause of peoples problems
[06:19:00] <Biomech> yeah lol
[06:19:43] <Biomech> the code is basically a contact form which test for errors and returns to the same page echoing the error message and using a fadein to stylish it :P So it must be something basic
[06:19:48] <Biomech> Ill have a go later and see what happens
[07:29:56] <siovene> Hello.
[07:30:25] <callumacrae> hi.
[07:30:30] <siovene> Is is possible, with jQuery, to animate so that when I insert an object into the dom, the room for is created by sliding things down?
[07:31:55] <sonnie> hi, i'm using jquery-ui's tabs. after i follow a link in some tab, i want to get back to that tab, not the default(first) one. is it possible?
[07:32:38] <callumacrae> siovene: Yup. Set the height of the object to 0px (or 1px), and then animate the height increase
[07:33:18] <siovene> callumacrae: thank you!
[07:33:26] <callumacrae> You might need to change the CSS a bit (or give it a wrapper div with overflow: none, with itself having a constant height)
[07:35:41] <siovene> I see.
[07:37:17] <siovene> callumacrae: what if I don't know what the final height will be?
[07:37:26] <siovene> I can't animate betwen 0 and auto.
[07:39:36] <callumacrae> siovene: .height()!
[07:39:45] <callumacrae> save it to a bar
[07:39:46] <callumacrae> var
[07:39:51] <siovene> right :)
[07:39:54] <siovene> thanks

[07:48:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how to temporary disable a click handler?
[07:52:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a TD with a click handler on it. Inside that TD is a SPAN with also a click handler on it. When I click the span, the TD click handler should not be executed... Is this possible?
[07:55:22] <jammsen> ecky--ptang-zoob: try z-index
[07:57:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> jammsen: I tried, no luck :(
[07:58:15] <sunbeam> jQuery('#description').prop("readonly", "false");
[07:58:19] <sunbeam> when i set this
[07:58:23] <sunbeam> it will not be possible anymore for the user to remove text
[07:58:30] <sunbeam> from the textarea
[07:58:45] <sunbeam> i am creating a text box with a count down of remaining characters
[07:58:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aah .stopPropogation() is what i need
[07:58:54] <sunbeam> when it is 0, i want to disable the user to type more text
[08:08:01] <victorbjelkholm> sunbeam, didn't you ask the same question yesterday? Or have I just dreamed about the removeProp(); answer?
[08:12:07] <drvanon> Hello, I am trying to send the server the value of a text input at the moment it is typed, I have tried key down but when I used key down I didn't get the latest information (the whole string - 1 char), and change didn't work because you have to un-focus, is there any hint you can give me?
[08:13:38] <sunbeam> victorbjelkholm: no it was the same me :)
[08:13:43] <sunbeam> victorbjelkholm: but, what sense woud that make?
[08:13:55] <sunbeam> victorbjelkholm: the user still cannot remove the text he typed too much
[08:14:14] <victorbjelkholm> sunbeam, could you make a jsFiddle?
[08:14:19] <sunbeam> yes
[08:14:36] <sunbeam> dont know how i can include thta plugin though

[09:56:40] <Gates> How can I made a navigation that scrolls to the h1 where the ID matches the h1#ID
[09:57:11] <Gates> <a href="#about">About</a> is the nav
[09:57:23] <Gates> and the <h1 id="about">About</h1> is the h1
[09:57:31] <Gates> smoothly scrolls down to it
[10:04:09] <sunbeam> shoky: do you know if it's possible to send a parameter to a .js script?>
[10:04:15] <sunbeam> (the max characters in my case)
[10:04:19] <sunbeam> I don't want to add it inline
[10:07:10] <Gates> nvm i just wrote one
[10:07:15] <Gates> its just missing some features id like =[
[10:07:39] <Gates> like when u scroll past that h1 it changes the main nav to be in the current state (adding/removing classes)
[10:07:58] <shoky> sunbeam: you can't send a parameter no. but where would you send the parameter from? that'd still be inline, just in the html, not the .js
[10:09:34] <sunbeam> nvm i guess i just better use wp_localize_script

[10:34:23] <Qalqi> what am i doing wrong?
[10:34:56] <Qalqi> should i do $("<div>" {class:"x y"})
[10:37:18] <sunbeam> shoky: here still?
[10:37:53] <mordof> Qalqi: let me see if i can find a guide on selectors for you
[10:37:59] <mordof> Qalqi: have you ever done any CSS before?
[10:38:25] <Qalqi> i am actually trying to create a div with classes x and y
[10:38:46] <sunbeam> how can I find a <th><label> that's empty its tr?
[10:38:48] <mordof> Qalqi: so why would you not do that how you would in HTML?
[10:38:55] <Qalqi> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[10:39:05] <sunbeam> i want to remove those <tr> that have <th><label> children that are empty
[10:39:18] <mordof> Qalqi: exactly, read that page
[10:39:30] <Qalqi> mordof: x and y are variables
[10:39:48] <Qalqi> so cant do it with html
[10:40:30] <mordof> $("<div class=\""+ x + " " + y + "\">div content here</div>")   o.O
[10:40:36] <mordof> of course you can do it with html
[10:41:20] <mordof> Qalqi: you build the string using your variables, and pass it to jQuery
[10:41:59] <mordof> Qalqi: now, there is the props attribute..
[10:42:48] <mordof> Qalqi: $("<div>div content here</div>", {"class": x + " " + y})  would also work
[10:44:23] <mordof> Qalqi: using an array as the "class" value doesn't work, as an array .toString() will simply concat and add a comma as a delimiter. this will break the class attribute in the actual output
[10:44:41] <Qalqi> mordof: ok
[10:44:42] <mordof> if you did a custom .concat on it and specified the delimiter as a space, that would work though
[10:44:43] <Qalqi> gotit
[10:45:51] <sunbeam> how can I find a <th><label> that's empty its tr?
[10:45:52] <sunbeam> i want to remove those <tr> that have <th><label> children that are empty
[10:46:21] <mordof> sunbeam: ah, it took re-reading what you said to understand what you wanted, heh

[10:48:11] <mordof> er..

[10:48:18] <mordof> $("tr").has("th label:empty") i think
[10:48:28] <mordof> yep, that's it
[10:48:47] <sunbeam> sec
[10:48:50] <mordof> EdwardIII: check if the element has a parent
[10:48:57] <sunbeam>  mor$("tr").has("th label:empty").remove();
[10:49:00] <sunbeam>  mordof $("tr").has("th label:empty").remove();

[10:50:00] <rio{> If I have a draggable (jquery-ui) and it has helper clone. How can I style the original element while dragging?
[10:50:22] <mordof> rio{: jquery-ui places a class on the object being dragged. simply style that class
[10:50:37] <rio{> mordof: I thought so too
[10:50:43] <rio{> but only the helper gets the class
[10:50:58] <mordof> was wondering if that's why you stipulated about the helper
[10:51:00] <mordof> sec
[10:52:22] <mordof> rio{: attaching a start and stop event should give you the ui element you've clicked on insttead of the helper. try applying your own class to that
[10:52:36] <EdwardIII> the issue is, text() seems to be returning aggregated data rather than an array? http://jsfiddle.net/dPHJ8/
[10:52:46] <EdwardIII> even though it's looping over multiple elements
[10:53:24] <EdwardIII> http://jsfiddle.net/dPHJ8/1/ # rather
[10:53:27] <rio{> mordof: Ah thanks. Will try that solution out
[10:54:08] <mordof> EdwardIII: .text() doesn't return an array, it returns a concatenated string
[10:54:09] <sunbeam> if(jQuery("#cpt_something").has("th td:empty")) {
[10:54:14] <sunbeam> this is for some reason always true
[10:54:15] <mordof> EdwardIII: CakeBiscuitsChocolate
[10:54:19] <EdwardIII> mordof: yeah
[10:54:22] <sunbeam> any idea what i do wrong here?
[10:54:26] <EdwardIII> mordof: any idea how to approach?
[10:54:42] <EdwardIII> mordof: is there something like text() but that returns the array unconcat
[10:55:11] <mordof> sunbeam: i have no idea what code you're running that on. couldn't say
[10:55:33] <mordof> EdwardIII: i would wager you'd have to do a .each() on the 'li' and check if 'Cake' == $(this).text()
[10:55:42] <sunbeam> mordof: div#cpt_something has a <table> that has a <th><td></td></th>
[10:55:42] <EdwardIII> bah humbug
[10:56:06] <mordof> sunbeam: well - that's an empty td. why would you expect it to be false?
[10:56:15] <sunbeam> because its true on every page
[10:56:23] <sunbeam> even if the #cpt_something doesnt exist
[10:56:50] <EdwardIII> thanks mordof
[10:57:02] <mordof> sunbeam: because jquery will return an empty array even if the element isn't there.  Go read the documentation on what .has does
[10:57:08] <mordof> EdwardIII: you're welcome
[10:57:38] <mordof> sunbeam: it doesn't return true. it's truthy. you also need to understand the difference between those two
[10:58:08] <mordof> EdwardIII: oh, hold on!
[10:58:11] <mordof> EdwardIII: give me a sec
[10:58:22] <sunbeam> mordof: ohh sorry
[10:58:32] <sunbeam> mordof: maybe better then to not use .has() in my case?
[10:58:50] <mordof> sunbeam: no, .has is exactly what you want. you're just not understanding how it behaves, or how if statements check data
[10:58:56] <mordof> sunbeam: you need to learn about those two
[11:01:40] <mordof> EdwardIII: instead of $("li").text() ->   $("li").map(function(){ return $(this).text(); })
[11:01:50] <mordof> EdwardIII: forgot about map, heh
[11:02:38] <mordof> EdwardIII: that should behave how you want using $.inArray, however.. you should know that it is likely slower than using a .each on the li and simply checking against it, instead of creating a new array, and then looping the array on top of it
[11:03:02] <mordof> performance and memory wise, using map and inArray are likely worse for both in comparison
[11:03:19] <EdwardIII> hrm issue is i want to break out of a func if it's true
[11:03:27] <EdwardIII> so if cake is there, end func
[11:03:40] <EdwardIII> but then if i use each, 'return' breaks out of the func. in the each, not out of the parent func if you see
[11:03:47] <EdwardIII> and it becomes mucho ' a turd '
[11:04:16] <mordof> EdwardIII: well.. you can either use the .inArray method, or you can assign a label to break to instead of just out of the first loop
[11:04:17] <mordof> up to you
[11:04:26] <EdwardIII> the real code: https://gist.github.com/3772536
[11:04:46] <EdwardIII> a label heh
[11:05:14] <EdwardIII> i appreciate being armed with the knowledge, thanks for all the tips
[11:05:20] * mordof nods
[11:05:29] <mordof> EdwardIII: any time :) the more knowledge the better
[11:05:48] <mordof> EdwardIII: feel free to either send me a message, or track me down in #javascript, if you ever want more verbosity, lol
[11:06:05] <EdwardIII> if we were in the same office i'd say "bbc micro called, they want their programming language back" but that might come across as facetious on IRC - that's what comes to mind when thinking in terms of labels heh
[11:08:59] <mordof> EdwardIII: lol
[11:09:04] <mordof> EdwardIII: yeah - labels can get messy
[11:09:17] <mordof> EdwardIII: but they can also be used cleanly too. it's all about how you utilize them
[11:11:54] <Lucky--> for complex objects in knockout, would i use ko.createChildContext(myparent); or myParent.extend({}); or somthing else?
[11:13:30] <mordof> Lucky--: no idea what knockout is
[11:13:44] <Lucky--> knockout.js, mvvm framework
[11:13:46] <Lucky--> well library
[11:16:23] <mordof> Lucky--: so how does that relate to jquery specifically?
[11:18:11] <Lucky--> because its pretty awesome, and i figure people that know jquery would know it, and this chan isnt stritcly and only about jquery, or at least every time ive been in here
[11:18:44] <Lucky--> btw mordof you can check it out here: http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/PKDdG/
[11:19:24] <mordof> Lucky--: i know absolutely nothing about it, nor do i care to research it to be conmpletely honest
[11:19:30] <mordof> Lucky--: so i can't help you
[11:25:59] <firstclassfunc> knockoutjs looked cool to me initially, but after a while I realized it does too much for my taste
[11:26:11] <EdwardIII> backbone fan?
[11:26:56] <Lucky--> i've learned backbone
[11:26:59] <Lucky--> just haven't used it
[11:27:00] <firstclassfunc> nope, I don't really have a JS framework I rely on
[11:27:01] <Lucky--> i liked what i saw
[11:27:36] <Lucky--> i do .net work, and the author of knockout works for ms so they are very friendly towards each other
[11:28:10] <Lucky--> plus upshot.js will be utilizing it http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/06/01/the-upshot-its-a-knockout.aspx
[11:28:31] <Lucky--> and upshot is siiiick. its basically full orm context accessible and passed down to the client
[11:30:02] <firstclassfunc> hmm
[11:30:30] <EdwardIII> hey, any ideas about editing this multiple select box even though it's hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/XBbsZ/
[11:30:42] <EdwardIII> if i inspect the element cake and biscuit aren't selected. if i remove display: none, they are
[12:10:00] <shoky> Lucky--: what does "for complex objects" mean
[12:12:14] <shoky> Lucky--: bindingContext.extend() doesn't create a nested context
[12:12:27] <shoky> so it depends if you want one

[14:39:47] <sunbeam> mordof: here?
[14:41:12] <mordof> sunbeam: hi
[14:42:45] <sunbeam> i still don't get how i should use .has in my case
[14:44:03] <sunbeam> jQuery("#cpt").has("th td:empty").remove();
[14:44:05] <mordof> exactly like i demonstrated. The purpose of .has is to say "ok jquery - i've told you what I want to select, but please only give me the ones that have this inside it" - and you're telling it to look for an empty label
[14:44:27] <sunbeam> oh
[14:44:54] <mordof> or an empty td, or whatever
[14:44:56] <mordof> it can be any selector
[14:45:02] <sunbeam> ok
[14:45:08] <mordof> the point is, it'll only return whatever you're selecting if that meets the conditions
[14:45:28] <sunbeam> jQuery("#cpt").has("td:empty").remove();
[14:45:30] <mordof> in terms of your if statement - if you write a jquery selector for an element that does not exist, it still returns to you an empty jquery array
[14:45:41] <sunbeam> so that cannot work this way
[14:45:47] <mordof> it can
[14:46:09] <mordof> you're telling jquery to remove #cpt from the DOM if it has an empty td inside it
[14:46:17] <sunbeam> ohhhhhh
[14:46:29] <sunbeam> i just need to remove the parent <tr>
[14:46:35] <sunbeam> that contains the empty <td>
[14:46:53] <mordof> which is why my original selector was $("tr").has("td:empty")  - not #cpt
[14:47:32] <mordof> now, please keep in mind
[14:47:43] <mordof> using something like that - if you have a large table, it could be quite slow
[14:47:49] <sunbeam> ok
[14:47:55] <mordof> it'd have to be a rather large table to get slow (or a slower computer in general)
[14:48:25] <sunbeam> like 20 rows of 10 columns is not enough
[14:48:32] <sunbeam> to make it slow?
[14:50:27] <mordof> no, that's fine
[14:50:27] <konr_trab> I'm getting a string with only the 'Content-Type' header with .getAllResponseHeaders(). Am I possibly doing anything wrong?
[14:51:01] <mordof> konr_trab: asking if you're "possibly" doing anything wrong, without providing us to a link of what you're trying to do (a gist, for instance), doesn't help anyway
[14:51:59] <mordof> konr_trab: i suppose it depends on the server setup, how you're trying to acecss the file, etc etc
[14:52:08] <mordof> konr_trab: usually, more headers than just that are sent
[15:02:33] <diverdude> if i swap an image, can jquery create some nice transition animation ?
[15:22:38] <relipse> how do i select an element with 3 classes remove, foo, and bar
[15:22:50] <relipse> i tried $('.remove .foo .bar') but it did not work
[15:22:56] <d1gital> newb here;
[15:23:47] <d1gital> ".button is not a function"  Is it?  Is this something that's changed from an older version?
[15:24:41] <Matt_P> Its a func from ui
[15:24:53] <vladikoff> relipse, see console for more info, http://jsfiddle.net/CBk8L/
[15:25:29] <Matt_P> $("button").button(); turns all <button> elements into buttons
[15:26:02] <relipse> sweet it worked thanks vladikoff
[15:28:23] <d1gital> I see.. I have included jquery-ui-1.8.9.custom.min.js ... so it should be a function then, right?  is there anything that would have undefined it?
[15:29:42] <vladikoff> d1gital, in that file, one of the first lines has a build link, can you paste that link here?
[15:31:52] <d1gital> vladikoff: thanks, but I fixed it. I found another jquery version referenced from a php include().  It works now.
[15:32:12] <vladikoff> d1gital, nice
[15:56:21] <arielserafini> relipse: $('.remove.foo.bar')
[15:57:27] <ansimation> how familiar are you guys with Jcrop? This thing works great on small images but images that have to be scaled have the crop in the wrong area.
[16:09:24] <Nomikos> brainfreeze time question.. http://jsfiddle.net/Ry2xp/ -> this doesn't work - but I thought variables were looked up in the calling scope if they could not be found in the function scope?
[16:09:50] <blindMoe> is $.src = 'foobar.png'; recommended to be used when setting the src of an image or is $.attr({ src: foobar.png }); better?
[16:13:02] <Eviltwin> Nomikos: http://jsfiddle.net/Ry2xp/1/
[16:14:30] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: ok.. that.. I could not get that to work locally
[16:16:05] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: ehr, retracting that. If the var blaat is defined inside the jQuery block, it doesn't work. Why not? Is that not the parent scope of the run_me() when it's being called?
[16:16:24] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: as in here: http://mech.cx/var/tmp/wah.php
[16:16:43] <Eviltwin> The scope is defined by where the code is written, not where it is called
[16:17:52] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: ok. I thought if a running function could not find a value for a var, it looked at its parent scope
[16:18:07] <Nomikos> but.. obviously I should re-read those chapters >.<
[16:19:33] <Eviltwin> Nomikos: The scope is defined by where the function is defined
[16:20:04] <Nomikos> I wonder how I have a managed to write working code all this time without having that done :-/
[16:20:14] <Nomikos> *down
[16:21:16] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/Cm26G/
[16:21:37] <Eviltwin> var a = "foo"; var b = "foo2"; is in the parent scope of both v and w
[16:21:54] <Eviltwin> However the w and v functions are siblings
[16:22:03] <Eviltwin> Meaning their scopes are separate
[16:22:19] <Eviltwin> You can see that the redefinition of b in w does not affect v's b
[16:23:22] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: many thanks
[16:28:51] <coldhead> WHO'S READY TO KICK SOME GOALS
[16:31:23] <Nomikos> Eviltwin: that totally fixed my code, another inch closer to the finish..
[16:40:10] <coldhead> harsh
[16:40:35] <Nomikos> What goals would you like kicked?
[16:41:01] <coldhead> today i think we should focus on quality in our core competencies
[16:41:12] <coldhead> also "values"
[16:45:36] <Eviltwin> ppaul / pppaul / ppppaul has spoken about 200 lines in here and has joined / parted / quit over 3700 times
[16:50:54] <coldhead> and yet i miss him already
[16:54:00] <coldhead> bot-t: tell pppaul i will never forget you
[16:54:01] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[16:54:06] <Nomikos> :-D
[18:17:23] <coder7of9> change is a literal text 'warn' however it is undefined when it reaches the method. the same setup works for an onclick   $('#mytext').change(function( event ) { wvalidate(this, this.form, change);});		
[18:17:58] <coder7of9> actually that last change id params.change
[18:18:11] <coder7of9> wvalidate(this, this.form, params.change)
[19:02:08] <BuGo> how to dirrectly set datapicker data inside beforeShow callback?
[19:02:44] <BuGo> i want do set year and month before picker is shown
[19:48:16] <madprops> is there a way to check when $("link[rel=stylesheet]").attr({href : "/media/css/" + data['theme'] + ".css"});  this has completed?
[19:49:02] <Shai-Tan> I have a ui dialog and wish to close it from a link inside the dialog. I cannot even make an alert work inside the dialog.. How is this done?
[19:49:15] <Shai-Tan> is it becase the dialog is not aware of the jquery code?
[19:50:14] <Shai-Tan> $('#eligible_continue').click(function() { alert( 'here we are' ); });
[20:41:25] <thomasgriffin> I've got a question about image preloading - I'm using FlexSlider and am having to deal with large galleries of 50+ large images. My solution has been to load the first image and then for the rest of the images, place a "holder" image (1x1 transparent gif) that is swapped out for the actual image when the slider gets initialized. It fires a callback function called start where I execute this code: http://pastebin.com/EBB18Y
[20:41:58] <thomasgriffin> The problem is - at least from what I know, this is synchronous, and I would like it to be asynchronous so as to not delay the loading of anything else after this
[20:42:44] <thomasgriffin> it works incredibly well - but I just want to make sure that it is asynchronous - any ideas on how to splice that in here?
[20:59:15] <thomasgriffin> as an update - I can just preload the image asynchronously before I switch attributes, which appears to work flawlessly :-)
[21:05:14] <jmar777> is there a way to create a namespaced special event?  e.g., `$.event.special['foo.bar'] = {...};` ?
[21:08:28] <coldhead> $('foo').bind('customevent.customnamepsace'); $('foo').trigger('customevent');
[21:09:57] <jmar777> coldhead: maybe i'm missing something - how does that help with a special event?
[21:10:29] <coldhead> i am demonstrating how do to a custom event
[21:10:30] <jmar777> coldhead: here's an example - http://jsfiddle.net/sKWhD/
[21:11:24] <raj> how can I test whether a argument passed to a function is an array or a string?
[21:11:25] <jmar777> coldhead: i'm specifically trying to figure out how to do that with a "special event" - my _default handler is never invoked, unless I change the special event to just 'foo' instead of 'foo.bar'
[21:11:25] <coldhead> i have never used this event.special stuff
[21:11:28] <jmar777> coldhead: ahh
[21:11:32] <raj> *an argument
[21:11:39] <coldhead> i only know custom events as i demonstrated
[21:11:46] <coldhead> not sure of the distinction
[21:11:55] <coldhead> it's basically my first day using jQuery
[21:12:12] <coldhead> ?mdc typeof @ raj
[21:12:21] <coldhead> come on bot-t
[21:12:23] <coldhead> you can do this
[21:12:25] <bot-t> raj, typeof | MDN - The typeof operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[21:12:27] <raj> coldhead, is it a bad thing to do?
[21:12:33] <raj> testing for type
[21:12:45] <coldhead> no at all
[21:12:52] <coldhead> if you care about the type then you should test for it
[21:13:00] <coldhead> its a fundamental part of javascript
[21:14:03] <raj> it's so I can pass a string or an array to the function
[21:14:21] <jmar777> coldhead: looks like you can achieve what I was going for by checking the event's namespace manually: http://jsfiddle.net/sKWhD/1/
[21:14:45] <coldhead> raj: yes
[21:15:11] <raj> actually, is there a 1 liner that could test if it's a string and put it into an array if so?
[21:16:03] <coldhead> nicely done, jmar777
[21:16:08] <jmar777> raj: `typeof theArg === 'string' && myArray.push(theArg);`
[21:16:27] <jmar777> raj: although an if check might be a little more readable :p
[21:17:14] <coldhead> theArg = (typeof theArg === 'string' ? [theArg] : theArg)
[21:17:23] <raj> if (typeof theArg === 'string') myArray.push(theArg);
[21:17:45] <raj> nice
[21:17:56] <raj> thank you
[21:17:58] <raj> both
[21:18:27] <raj> i do'nt need a `var` before theArg since it's an argument to the function, right?
[21:18:36] <coldhead> right
[21:18:43] <coldhead> it's already function scoped
[21:19:13] <raj> cool
[21:26:42] <Shai-Tan> I have a small peice of code in a dialog box with a button with a class resubmit-postcode, and I have $('.resubmit-postcode').click(function() { alert('howdy');}); but a button with that class does not 'see' the
[21:27:13] <Shai-Tan> how do I execute jquery from whithin the dialog
[21:39:00] <GoSox> isssss the php channel broken or something?
[21:39:09] <GoSox> i can't seem to get in but i can get in all the other channels no problem
[21:55:48] <coldhead> lol GoSox
[22:06:26] <arielserafini> maybe that's for the best :)
[22:17:00] <galymzhan> Is there a method in jQuery to list registered plugins ?
[22:26:19] <idiocrash> hi guys, has anyone here used Tablesorter 2.0? http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[22:26:52] <idiocrash> I keep getting "undefined is not a function"
[22:27:02] <idiocrash> but everything is setup exactly as the docs prescribe
[22:27:06] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ idiocrash
[22:27:06] <bot-t> idiocrash, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:27:13] <Eviltwin> Preferably the former
[22:27:31] <coldhead> galymzhan: not that i know of but you could inspect $.fn maybe
[22:27:53] <idiocrash> I'm sorry to say that I can't share the code I'm working on, but can I at least get some ideas on why I would get that error?
[22:28:01] <idiocrash> what causes "undefiend is not a function"
[22:28:21] <galymzhan> coldhead: is $.fn supposed to be an array?
[22:28:39] <galymzhan> Because right now $.fn gives me "[]"
[22:31:15] <coldhead> hmm, ignore me then
[22:31:33] <tw2113> i do all the time
[22:32:06] <tw2113> not really, but it sounded good in the moment
[22:32:55] <coldhead> i admire what you did there

[22:47:19] <wingy> how do i handle an attribute value with /
[22:47:34] <wingy> eg. div[data-url=/accounts/current]
[22:47:49] <wingy> that one isn't recognizable
[22:48:26] <vladikoff> wingy, sec
[22:48:51] <wingy> double \\
[22:49:57] <vladikoff> wingy, http://jsfiddle.net/cDTkc/
[22:50:25] <wingy> oh
[22:50:29] <wingy> putting it in ''
[22:51:00] <coldhead> simple and effective
[22:51:04] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:51:07] <wingy> yeah
[22:51:25] <wingy> \\ worked as well but putting it within quotes is better
[22:53:59] <wingy> vladikoff: thx btw

[23:58:28] <abjorn> |pez| had too much to drink
[23:58:53] <|pez|> On saturday, hell yes.
[23:58:58] <mazzachre> Anyway, what is the preffered way of storing global configuration objects on a site? I was considering $('body').data() but is this fine?
[23:59:27] <mazzachre> Well me too on saturday night, but not so much I had a hangover on sunday at least...
[23:59:38] <|pez|> I'm not hungover. :D
[23:59:41] <|pez|> I'm just sick.
[23:59:45] <mazzachre> :D
