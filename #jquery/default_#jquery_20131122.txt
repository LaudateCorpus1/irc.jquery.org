[00:01:26] <kpl> What about this?: http://webdesign.maratz.com/lab/fancy-checkboxes-and-radio-buttons/jquery.html
[00:31:36] <wookieHK> hi, i have a page that is loaded mainly through HTML. The pages own JS altering this and adds in more html. My JS inside tampermoney when run does not see any content manipulated by the page JS, only the raw HTML. Will jquery allow me to get round this? JS noob here
[00:53:02] <DarsVaeda> using $.getScript to async load scripts and then run code, do I use the success callback or do I use .done()?
[00:54:57] <DarsVaeda> i.e. I check if an input field is somewhere in the dom, if it is there I load a script to insert a placeholder text, if that script is loaded I want to run it on that input field
[01:00:16] <Cork> DarsVaeda: that is the same thing
[01:00:18] <Cork> so both work
[01:00:54] <DarsVaeda> just another way to write it?
[01:00:59] <DarsVaeda> okay thanks :)
[01:57:03] <mikunos1> Hi guys
[02:10:48] <Thoams> Mornin'
[02:11:38] <Rashad> hello.
[02:11:58] <Rashad> How do I do this:$('.class.sub_class')
[02:12:07] <Thoams> Calling .detach and / or .appendTo appears to break my event handlers... is there a way around that?
[02:12:09] <Thoams> http://pastebin.com/zSEj5c2B
[02:12:29] <Thoams> mouseleave isn't fired ^
[02:12:54] <Cork> Rashad: just like that
[02:13:05] <Cork> Rashad: or do you mean sub_class is a different element?
[02:13:23] <Rashad> Yes.
[02:13:42] <Rashad> It's not an element... it's a class of elements.
[02:14:09] <Cork> Rashad: could you show the html you want to match
[02:14:13] <Cork> including the structure
[02:14:24] <Cork> DON'T dump it in here though
[02:14:32] <Cork> use a pb or jsfiddle
[02:14:35] <Rashad> <div class="class"><div class="sub_class">CONTENT</div></div>
[02:14:37] <Rashad> Something like this.
[02:14:42] <Cork> Rashad: add a space
[02:14:44] <Rashad> Then I have several lines of these.
[02:14:47] <Rashad> Ok.
[02:14:51] <peepsalot> how can i get attributes of a body tag from within a responsetext?  $(responsetext) doesn't include body, only its children as i understand it
[02:14:54] <Cork> $('.class .sub_class')
[02:15:07] <Cork> Thoams: what event handler is breaking?
[02:15:14] <Rashad> Works now, thanks.
[02:15:41] <Thoams> Cork: it appears as though mouseleave is not firing, without moving my reveal around the DOM it does work as intended
[02:15:48] <Cork> peepsalot: no but dom isn't allowed to include things outside body
[02:16:18] <Cork> Thoams: the each you have there isn't needed
[02:16:32] <peepsalot> i need to read a data attribute from the body tag, how should i do this?
[02:16:33] <Thoams> d'oh
[02:16:36] <Thoams> course not
[02:16:38] <Cork> $(".hotspot").mouseenter().mouseleave()
[02:17:24] <Cork> Thoams: well mouse leave on an element you move to another element won't trigger mouseleave on the current element
[02:17:34] <Cork> cause there is no mouseout event to bubble
[02:17:57] <Thoams> so after reattaching I need to bind the leave again...
[02:19:39] <Thoams> ee..rr..
[02:20:55] <Cork> Thoams: no, but child elements won't trigger leave on the parent when they are moved
[02:22:56] <Cork> Thoams: then you can't use jquery's parser
[02:23:02] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[02:23:04] <Cork> peepsalot: ^
[02:23:18] <Cork> peepsalot: jquery uses documentfragments
[02:23:19] <Thoams> Ah.. I'm getting closer to solving, thanks Cork. Just managed to fade out the entire slideshow, but at least something faded out!
[02:23:26] <Cork> and it just doesn't keep the html or body around
[02:24:04] <peepsalot> ok i guess i'll write a regex
[02:24:46] <Cork> peepsalot: basically you should never get data in that form for ajax calls
[02:25:15] <peepsalot> i don't have control over the page, it is for a greasemonkey script
[02:25:21] <Cork> ah
[02:25:39] <Cork> peepsalot: and greasemonkey is loading a third party page?
[02:26:03] <peepsalot> its loading a page from the same domain that the script is running from
[02:26:11] <Rashad> Cork: seems like the .css method only change styles for existing elements. How do I change the actual css values for the class as defined by my css code?
[02:26:23] <Cork> peepsalot: an iframe might be a better option then
[02:26:29] <Rashad> css values as definged by... *
[02:26:36] <Rashad> without the "for the class". Sorry.
[02:26:46] <Cork> Rashad: you can't do that through jquery
[02:26:52] <Cork> cause jquery works on dom elements
[02:27:16] <Cork> you would have to work on document.styleSheets
[02:27:17] <Rashad> So I can't change the "default" css values as set by my css code?
[02:27:40] <Cork> if you want to modify the style sheets you need to actually modify them
[02:27:47] <Rashad> Aha.
[02:28:17] <Cork> there are plugins for jquery that simplifies that a bit
[02:28:52] <Rashad> Can you name any?
[02:28:55] <Cork> https://github.com/f0r4y312/jquery-stylesheet
[02:29:23] <Cork> i think there are more out there
[02:29:23] <Rashad> Thanks.
[02:29:27] <Cork> i don't use them so donno
[02:30:41] <Rashad> Do you recommend using them?
[02:31:01] <Cork> not really
[02:31:07] <Rashad> Why not?
[02:31:22] <Cork> i recommend having static stylesheets and doing things like this with classes
[02:31:42] <Cork> Rashad: cause when you modify the stylesheet the entire page needs to be invalidated
[02:31:47] <Cork> cause the rules has to be checked again
[02:31:57] <Cork> and 2. you move styling into js
[02:32:04] <Cork> where it doens't belong
[02:32:15] <Cork> and 3. there is no need for it
[02:32:25] <Rashad> Well the thing is that I can't determine the value of some backround-image: property statically.
[02:32:50] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:33:28] <Rashad> I just want to update the value of some background-image: property using js (because the value is going to be determined using js dynamically)
[02:34:35] <Rashad> I used             $('.you .pic').css("background-image", "NEWVALUE"); , but it doesn't update the rule so any new .you .pic elements are going to have the old value for background-image
[02:35:00] <Rashad> And I do need to add new .you .pic elements at runtime with javascript.
[02:38:11] <DRSK> Can I select an elements ::after ? $( '.myClass::after' ).on( 'click'.. ) ?
[02:39:33] <pluffsy> hi!
[02:40:19] <pluffsy> Is it a good idea to browser sniff for <=IE8 and serve jquery 1.9 there and jquery 2.0 in other cases?
[02:41:23] <blinkdesign> @pluffsy Conditional comments are a full proof way for older IE
[02:43:52] <pluffsy> blinkdesign: yeah thanks. but the idea of serving 1.9 for old IE and 2.0 for others is that how most people do it nowdays? I have never tried 2.0 but speedier and smaller sounds good :)
[02:44:46] <blinkdesign> There are other ways, such as the YepNope lib with Modernizr for example
[02:44:50] <blinkdesign> Depends on your site I guess
[02:52:10] <pluffsy> blinkdesign: thanks I'll check out those ways too.
[03:06:05] <zalun> hi, is JSFiddle still used for bug requests in jq
[03:06:07] <zalun> ?
[03:08:42] <SprkDev> I am trying to remove the property of css display block!important using jquery, But it doesnt work.
[03:08:50] <SprkDev> When I say remove, I don't mean none.
[03:09:09] <Cork> SprkDev: remove it?
[03:09:23] <Cork> it's !important you can't override it from style=""
[03:09:24] <SprkDev> In firebug when you select the value and cancel it, what is that? Because I am canceling the none. And it is not the same as display:block
[03:09:45] <Cork> SprkDev: you need to modify the style sheet
[03:10:04] <Cork> ?g jquery-stylesheets
[03:10:04] <b-ot> Cork: Style Properties | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/style-properties/
[03:10:09] <Cork> hmm
[03:10:12] <Cork> ?g jquery-stylesheets github
[03:10:13] <b-ot> Cork: f0r4y312/jquery-stylesheet · GitHub → https://github.com/f0r4y312/jquery-stylesheet
[03:10:13] <SprkDev> but I can't see display:none!important in the stylesheet.
[03:10:23] <Cork> SprkDev: you have a link?
[03:42:14] <flongo> Hi all - Im working on a JS widget where I'm trying to safely load jQuery in a separate namespace using noConflict() - however I'm running into issues when chain loading other jquery plugins. Can someone help ?
[03:42:59] <Cork> flongo: as long as jQuery is still the correct object it should work fine
[03:43:19] <Cork> if not, then yes plugins will be a problem
[03:43:46] <flongo> cork: var $ = jQuery.noConflict();  <- like that ?
[03:43:57] <Cork> no
[03:44:12] <Cork> var special = jQuery.noConflict(); should be safe
[03:44:15] <Cork> it should release $
[03:44:23] <Cork> and plugins should just work
[03:44:38] <Cork> if you want to run two versions of jquery you are in more of a problem though
[03:46:42] <flongo> my code at the moment checks if the site the widget is installed on already has jquery, if not - i load my own, i still want to do that as safely as possible. i had tried releasing $, which worked with my own code but not with other plugins (jquery-ui, and others)
[03:47:19] <Cork> flongo: it should work just fine
[03:47:27] <Cork> at lest with jquery ui
[03:47:51] <Cork> all well behaved plugins is wrapped in (function($) {})(jquery); and those should just work
[03:49:04] <flongo> ok, ill try again but will probably be back - thanks
[03:49:36] <Cork> flongo: might be you arn't waiting for the scripts to be loaded
[03:49:48] <Cork> flongo: if you dynamically load scripts you need to wait for them to load
[03:54:31] <flongo> cork: i am doing that through a function, but i'm starting to think that's possibly where the issue is as well. bbiab
[03:54:49] <Cork> flongo: how are you loading the lib?
[04:05:39] <flongo> cork: could send you a pastebin link via privmsg real quick if you've got time ?
[04:05:54] <Cork> i don't
[04:06:31] <flongo> ok
[04:09:01] <ribot> hey
[04:10:52] <ribot> how can i select a jQ object of a new element that i prepend? $('#mydiv').prepend('<span>test</span>').selectTeh() ?
[04:11:17] <Cork> ribot: store the element into an object
[04:11:35] <Cork> var test = $('<span>test</span>'); $('#mydiv').prepend(test)
[04:15:05] <nardev> i have some problem with .each which is in .click().. it works ok but
[04:15:12] <flongo> cork: the gist of it is this - i've got an anonymous immediate executing function where from which i check for the existence of jquery and load it with a callback function that uses noconflict() to assign to a new var, calling my main() function right after. the execution order doesnt seem to happen the way i want it to - and checking for the existence of jquery in main() now gives me an error
[04:15:55] <Cork> flongo: when you check for jquery and notice that it doesn't exist
[04:16:16] <Cork> when you load jquery you need to listen for the load event from the script so you know when the script is actually loaded
[04:16:21] <nardev> i have some problem with .each which is in .click().. it works ok but when process should go again in same class.. it reads all other DOM elements twice or more times, depending which iteration it is...
[04:16:35] <Cork> first after that event fire, can you continue executing the normal action
[04:17:02] <Cork> flongo: or you could just add jquery as a dependency and let the website owner control it :)
[04:17:27] <Cork> (personally i would MUCH prefer that if i used the plugin)
[04:17:45] <Cork> i actually filter out plugins that bundle third party libs
[04:17:51] <Cork> those tend to break things
[04:18:22] <Cork> nardev: sounds like you bind the event handler each time something happens
[04:18:46] <Cork> nardev: so you end up with n event listeners instead of just 1
[04:18:50] <nardev> Cork maybe, i'm gonna make fiddle, it's bit complex to explain
[04:19:15] <nardev> Cork, can i fix it somehow quickly to see if that is the case before i make fiddle?
[04:19:45] <flongo> cork: i am checking for ready state and only using noconflict and calling main() when i've received it. im definitely up for alternatives though - i could have jquery as a dependency, but i still need to load jquery-ui and 1-2 other plugins, how would you go about doing that then ?
[04:19:46] <Cork> nardev: you most likely want to move the event listeners out of the loop
[04:20:06] <Cork> flongo: what do you mean by ready state?
[04:20:22] <Cork> if you mean $(document).ready it doesn't work like that
[04:21:18] <flongo> i got the function out of a book - hoping it's correct. if (!rdyState || /complete|loaded/.test(script.readyState))
[04:21:55] <Cork> uh
[04:22:18] <Cork> are you loading the script with xmlhttprequest?
[04:22:32] <Cork> cause no that was not what i expected
[04:22:57] <nardev> Cork, ah, i don't have any listener there.. it's quiz engine which have some "init" method. within that method i have some button.click and inside that i have .each which checks some values. That is all.. AND WHEN user fails to pass the quiz, it should be directed to the beginning. Everything works ok but THEN in next iteration, the script counts like there is "+1 box with question" for each iteration
[04:23:18] <Cork> var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src=url; src.onload = function() { alert('loaded'); }; document.head.appendChild(script);
[04:23:19] <flongo> nope im writing out the <script> tag to the page dynamically
[04:23:22] <Cork> flongo: ^
[04:24:32] <DRSK> Cork » how can I match something like if( e.target == $( '.something' ) ) ?
[04:24:34] <flongo> cork: ill show you the function, it's just a couple of lines
[04:24:46] <Cork> DRSK: if( e.target == $( '.something' )[0] )
[04:25:03] <DRSK> ooh thanks Cork
[04:25:43] <Cork> DRSK: or if($('.something').is(e.target))
[04:26:28] <asker> heyyo gys, im trying to bind the keydown event on live generated content but it won't work and i don't know why. $('#search_search').on('keydown', function(e) {alert(1);});
[04:26:35] <asker> do you have any idea what im doing wrong?
[04:27:10] <Cork> asker: $(document).on('keydown', '#search_search', function(e) {alert(1);});
[04:27:26] <Cork> asker: the element you bind the event listener on needs to exist
[04:27:41] <Cork> asker: if it doesn't bind it on a parent, and listen for the bubbling events instead
[04:27:41] <flongo> cork: sent, thanks
[04:27:54] <Cork> sent?
[04:28:23] <asker> yeah it works, thanks. i believe to remember it worked my way too. did they changed it on some version?
[04:28:44] <Cork> asker: you are most likely thinking of .live()
[04:28:58] <Cork> and yes the live command has been removed
[04:29:05] <Cork> cause it was fundamentally broken
[04:29:09] <asker> nah they replaced live by on
[04:29:13] <Cork> no
[04:29:17] <asker> and it worked like i pasted prev
[04:29:22] <Cork> no
[04:29:29] <Cork> on has never worked like live
[04:29:36] <asker> ok
[04:29:41] <Cork> on has a syntax that works like bind
[04:29:47] <Cork> and a syntax that works like delegate
[04:30:00] <Cork> delegate is the replacement for live
[04:30:05] <Cork> but with a different syntax
[04:32:06] <asker> alright, thanks for info
[04:34:05] <Serdar> short question about modal dialog
[04:34:33] <Serdar> when I open ore than one dialog, the latest dialog is blocking the previous ones
[04:34:57] <Serdar> can remove this?
[04:35:17] <Cork> don't think so
[04:35:24] <Cork> it is just how the dialog works
[04:36:12] <Serdar> what about onclick, so I can get the min front?
[04:36:46] <Cork> you could use the moveToFront method (or similar name)
[04:37:15] <Cork> Serdar: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-moveToTop
[04:37:32] <Serdar> yes this is my question, if I opened two modal dialogs and click on the old one I wont it in front
[04:37:45] <Cork> you can't click on the old one
[04:37:55] <Cork> it would be covered by the cover screen
[04:38:13] <Cork> and if you remove that screen it wouldn't be modal
[04:38:21] <Cork> as the user would be able to click on the content behind it
[04:38:31] <Serdar> what if I put these dialogs in a array and put them to top while pressing arrow keys?
[04:38:57] <Cork> sounds like you should just not use modal
[04:39:02] <Cork> and instead add your own cover screen
[04:39:16] <Serdar> cover screen?
[04:39:22] <Cork> over the content
[04:39:47] <Serdar> but the modal dialogs look nice and work :(
[04:39:57] <Cork> ok?
[04:39:59] <Serdar> but this behaviour is making me mad
[04:40:01] <Cork> it's just see
[04:40:04] <Cork> *css
[04:40:16] <Cork> add the same for your own cover screen and it would look identical
[04:40:29] <nardev> Cork, i have sent you a jsfiddle url, if you could look at my issue :( i would explain what is the problem
[04:40:52] <Cork> nardev: "sent"?
[04:41:00] <nardev> Cork, in private
[04:41:03] <nardev> window
[04:41:07] <Cork> check your status window
[04:41:25] <nardev> ok
[04:41:31] <nardev> than, here it is
[04:41:33] <nardev> http://jsfiddle.net/nardev/DhTQw/1/
[04:41:35] <Serdar> Cork the arrow variant is not a good solution?
[04:42:23] <Cork> Serdar: well if you don't care about user discoverability, and just want to hack it to work
[04:42:37] <nardev> Cork, here is short explanation, you just need to fail once and try again to see the issue:   it's quiz engine which have some "init" method. within that method i have some button.click and inside that i have .each which checks some values. That is all.. AND WHEN user fails to pass the quiz, it should be directed to the beginning. Everything works ok but THEN in next iteration, the script counts like there is "+1 box with question" for each iteration
[04:42:57] <Cork> short...
[04:43:04] <Cork> Serdar: but you would still have to fiddle with the cover screen, as it is where you will have to grab the event
[04:43:29] <Cork> Serdar: cause the coverscreen kills events, that is what makes the dialog modal
[04:44:53] <nardev> Cork, answer first B and other two questions answer what ever you want.. it will thell you at the end to "restart" it and when you restart it, again choose B in first question and look at the feedback popup,
[04:45:31] <nardev> in every next iteration, my code think that there is that many questions
[04:45:45] <nardev> it multiplies everything by the number of iterations you fail
[04:45:52] <nardev> if you fail 3 times it
[04:46:13] <nardev> it sees that there is 1. question three times there
[04:46:29] <nardev> so when i count something it's not valid
[04:46:31] <nardev> any more
[04:49:21] <nardev> Cork, :$ would you have some time to look into my issue? http://jsfiddle.net/nardev/DhTQw/1/
[04:53:39] <flongo> cork: you were right, my code was fine - it was a compatibility issue with the jquery version and one of the plugins i was loading. you said you usually don't use widgets that load other plugins - how would you suggest writing this then ? concatenating all the plugins sources together ?
[04:54:03] <Cork> flongo: dependency list
[04:54:36] <Cork> "this plugins depends on: jquery, jquery-ui (1.2.24. if needed), ...
[04:54:56] <Cork> and then if the site owner want to do something special about it they can
[04:55:10] <flongo> cork: definitely the most transparent way to go, but not 'easy'
[04:55:11] <Cork> and when they load it nothing magical happens that might break things for them
[04:55:21] <Cork> flongo: easy for just injecting yes
[04:55:36] <Cork> but less risk of breaking cause something didn't expect something to happen
[04:56:00] <Cork> flongo: just include the snippets to add for all the dependency
[04:56:04] <Cork> and be done with it
[04:56:29] <flongo> that's probably what i will end up doing :) thanks
[04:57:04] <Cork> <link href=""><link href=""><script src="\\code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script><script src="\\jquery-ui"></script><script src="your-script"></script>
[04:57:27] <Cork> that shouldn't scare anyone away as long as you explain what it does
[04:57:43] <Cork> and those that knows what it means will be happy cause you don't take them for idiots
[04:58:54] <Cork> flongo: though i still agree, write your code so it can work without $ being jquery
[04:59:02] <Cork> that is a good practice
[04:59:30] <Serdar> okay what's with this idea: I am opening a modal dialog each time I get a request from websocket. what if I put this in a queue or a map and take the next one from queue/map after closing the dialog?
[05:01:09] <flongo> cork: good points, will do that
[05:03:47] <l4ci> anyone with a galaxy s4 here and a minute to test a little bug on my site?
[05:03:59] <l4ci> just see if it works now?
[05:04:19] <nardev> anyone: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20145593/javascript-class-sees-multiple-doms-in-each-iteration-jquery-each-getting-conf
[05:31:34] * norbi says hi to all
[05:33:49] <norbi> guys, i have a $(¨a¨).click(function(){$(¨#example¨).dialog();}); how can i destroy that dialog before opening it again? if user clicks again on the ¨a¨ before it closes the dialog, then it reinits the dialog but not with all settings... i want to be sure if it clicks again then it destroys the old one then opens a new one
[05:35:17] <norbi> i tried to figure out what even occurs when user clicks again that button and the dialog is reinitialised, but open event is not trigered, neither create, neither focus... it just simply recreates a broken dialogue not trigering any event
[06:00:49] <gnu_d> Hi, if I got for instance some mask function and unmask, is there a way to wait for those functions to update the DOM before running some other functions?
[06:02:42] <joroci> gnu_d post the code
[06:03:30] <gnu_d> joroci: $(mask_object).unmask()
[06:03:58] <joroci> does it have a callback/
[06:04:00] <joroci> ?
[06:04:22] <gnu_d> joroci: I want to wait the DOM to update and then to unlock the function, cause I'm implementing a locking mechanism.

[06:05:11] <joroci> you can edit the plugin to accept a function
[06:05:41] <joroci> and then call it
[06:05:52] <gnu_d> joroci: without that :)
[06:06:04] <joroci> why ?
[06:07:16] <joroci> why without that?
[06:07:27] <gnu_d> joroci: cause lets assume we have 10 plugins :)
[06:07:41] <gnu_d> an universal way is the best
[06:08:01] <joroci> 10 mask plugins?
[06:09:08] <gnu_d> joroci: no, what if tomorrow comes another issue, again to modify the plugin ?
[06:09:19] <joroci> you didn't understand
[06:09:28] <joroci> in the plugins options
[06:09:46] <joroci> you add.. let's call it a success a function
[06:10:07] <joroci> and if the mask was completed succesfully it will call this function
[06:10:18] <joroci> so you actually call activate the plugin like
[06:10:28] <gnu_d> joroci: I know what you're telling, I just need an external solution without modifying any code
[06:10:55] <joroci>  $(mask_object).mask('label', function() {});
[06:12:08] <joroci> well there is no dom change event
[06:12:13] <joroci> you need to create one anyway
[06:12:55] <joroci> i mean there are but the browser support isn't very good
[06:13:33] <gnu_d> joroci: I don't like to use a timer :(
[06:13:42] <gnu_d> and I can't modify the plugin
[06:13:57] <joroci> not a timer
[06:14:39] <joroci> i mean add a custom event or use this http://davidwalsh.name/dom-events-javascript
[06:19:17] <gnu_d> joroci: I like this: DOMNodeRemoved
[06:19:44] <gnu_d> joroci: when the mask node has been removed, unlock the mechanism :)
[06:20:44] <cronin> why does calling jQuery.noConflict() at the bottom of my page break scripts referenced before it?
[06:21:49] <joroci> well i'm not sure it will work on all the browsers you need but check
[06:22:01] <joroci> cronin
[06:22:16] <joroci> where in the bottom
[06:22:23] <cronin> in a script file at the very bottom
[06:22:26] <Cork> cronin: well if the scripts before it uses it in event handlers they will run after you have killed $
[06:30:42] <clh> jquery 2.0 isn't supported by the validation plugin I typically use, can someone recommend a validation plugin that is 2.0 compatible?
[06:30:47] <gnu_d> joroci: you made my day :)
[06:32:11] <cronin> Cork: on this site I'm trying to debug, a script at the very bottom calls jQuery.noConflict(); from script.js. When I keep the script it, a bunch of inline jQuery (using a mix of jQuery() and $() breaks). Does jQuery.noConflict() break code that's referenced before it?
[06:32:55] <Cork> cronin: noConflicts resets the $ variable
[06:33:15] <Cork> so all scripts that runs in time (not code) after it will break if they don't reference to jQuery
[06:33:22] <cronin> Cork: so that explains the reason the code above is breaking. Okay, that's good enough for me!
[06:38:52] <arnaldop> Hello
[06:40:44] <arnaldop> I'm trying to understand something...is this correctly stated? -> http://jsfiddle.net/44XXG/
[06:41:10] <arnaldop> the problem is..I would like to change...#netProfit to something else if the checkbox gets checked...
[06:41:19] <arnaldop> so I'm trying to change it for..."THIS"
[06:41:47] <arnaldop> I can see it...in the developers tools of chrome...but on the browser I still see the old value
[06:51:28] <arnaldop> I need this form to be a bit more Velveeta
[06:51:31] <arnaldop> err
[06:51:35] <arnaldop> versatiletech
[06:51:40] <arnaldop> wtf
[06:51:42] <arnaldop> versatile
[06:52:24] <Velveeta> there ya go
[06:53:48] <Velveeta> so this fiddle is incomplete, where's the markup to associate with it?
[06:53:59] <Velveeta> and how are you binding up thise function to your checkboxes?
[06:54:24] <arnaldop> what the hell is this nickname
[06:54:42] <arnaldop> Velveeta I'll let you know in a bit
[06:55:15] <Velveeta> ok
[07:01:33] <JenniferB2>  Hi folks ... function A() { } ... how supported is the new A().constructor property ? Does it work in IE ? Don't have it so I can't test ...
[07:07:02] <FutureTense> dumb question, I know, but I'm doing a console.log("xxx").  I **think** its writing to the console, but chrome appears to be clearing it because the button is submitting the form.  how can I look at "old"forms
[07:09:06] <astropirate> FutureTense, hmmm if you want to look at what theform submited
[07:09:09] <astropirate> look under the network tab
[07:09:15] <astropirate> it will show the params sent to the server
[07:28:52] <gnu_d> joroci: Just to share the success document.body.addEventListener('DOMNodeRemoved', function(evt){} then I chekc evt.target, if that's the node I need, I remove the event, cool a ?
[07:28:58] <caliel> Good morning (UGT). I am trying to defer image loading with jQuery. I use this code: http://bpaste.net/show/152126/. But in IE7-IE8, this doesn't work. What am I doing wrong ? Thanks.
[07:31:44] <joroci> yea but what browsers support it/
[07:31:45] <joroci> ?
[07:33:05] <gnu_d> joroci: thought on that too, chrome and Firefox
[07:33:07] <caliel> do you have any hint or suggestion please ? I am going mad.
[07:33:41] <gnu_d> joroci: opera uses webkit, so it would work too
[07:33:50] <joroci> try using the load method caliel
[07:33:59] <joroci> well the problem is usually IE
[07:34:20] <gnu_d> joroci: I don't have ie :D
[07:34:52] <caliel> joroci: how ? Oo
[07:35:51] <Cork> gnu_d: no it is deprecated in both those browsers
[07:36:01] <Cork> you want to use observers instead
[07:36:13] <Cork> ?mdn mutation observer
[07:36:13] <b-ot> Cork: MutationObserver - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[07:36:52] <gnu_d> Cork: DOMNodeRemoved ?
[07:36:59] <Cork> yes
[07:37:11] <Cork> all the dom change events are deprecated
[07:37:35] <caliel> Cork: do you know what can I do with http://bpaste.net/show/152126/ this not working in IE7-8 ?
[07:37:39] <Cork> gnu_d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Events/Mutation_events
[07:37:52] <Cork> "Deprecated: This feature has been removed from the Web. Though some browsers may still support it, it is in the process of being dropped. Do not use it in old or new projects. Pages or Web apps using it may break at any time."
[07:38:55] <gnu_d> Cork: not fair :(, I just finished the locking mechanism, ok, back to the drawing board :D
[07:39:05] <Cork> caliel: why not just $('#mainContents .menu span.booking').append('<img src="img/menu-booking.jpg">') ?
[07:39:28] <Cork> caliel: why not just $('#mainContents .menu span.booking').append($('<img>').attr('src', 'img/menu-booking.jpg)
[07:39:32] <Cork> or *
[07:39:47] <Cork> caliel: also note i would recommend NOT using relative paths
[07:40:02] <Cork> cause those are different depending on what file you run it in
[07:40:25] <Cork> gnu_d: the observers are not very different
[07:40:36] <Cork> gnu_d: it's just a separate object
[07:40:53] <raj> would a 100 additional DOM elements slow down my webpage?
[07:41:02] <caliel> Cork: I tried that too. Is not working. Do I need to add <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge" /> after conditional comments ?
[07:41:09] <Cork> (the change is just cause the bubbling events is VERY expensive and they didn't want to go down that route again)
[07:41:14] <gnu_d> Cork: so I should go with MutationObserver ?
[07:41:20] <Cork> caliel: no
[07:41:25] <Cork> gnu_d: yes
[07:41:46] <Cork> though no ie 10 support
[07:41:53] <Cork> but it works in ie11
[07:42:05] <Cork> gnu_d: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver#Browser_compatibility
[07:42:36] <Cork> caliel: i doubt that code breaks in ie
[07:42:50] <Cork> caliel: it sounds more likely that it fails somewhere else
[07:43:04] <Cork> i've used that line back in ie5.5
[07:43:13] <joroci> Cork not a jquery question but if you wanted to create a multi calendar website what serverside would you choose
[07:43:14] <joroci> ?
[07:43:38] <caliel> Cork: I have just used your method, it does work in IE9 but not in IE7-IE8.
[07:43:52] <Cork> joroci: you mean something like google calender?
[07:44:20] <Cork> caliel: i don't have ie < 10 at hand so can't really help
[07:44:27] <joroci> basically you see let's say 5 colums where you can add and make changes to appointments every colum is for another person
[07:44:43] <Cork> ok
[07:45:00] <Cork> well i would prob use something simple
[07:45:07] <Cork> php should prob be enough
[07:45:17] <Cork> and it has the upperhand of working almost everywhere
[07:45:39] <joroci> yea i got it working with php but i want to create it in a better way
[07:45:43] <caliel> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/152126/
[07:45:45] <joroci> recreate
[07:45:48] <Cork> python is another option, but it has more demands on control of the server
[07:46:07] <joroci> how about node or mvc?
[07:46:28] <Cork> i'm fundamentally against running js on the server
[07:46:34] <joroci> why?
[07:46:37] <joroci> threading?
[07:46:44] <Cork> cause it isn't constructed for it
[07:46:59] <Cork> just as much as i don't like running java in a webpage
[07:47:13] <joroci> yea i hate that too
[07:47:24] <Cork> the right tool for the right job
[07:47:40] <joroci> and no MVC?
[07:47:42] <Cork> though like i said, it is more my preferance then anything else
[07:47:51] <Cork> mvc is used in many languages
[07:48:00] <joroci> yea i mean .NET
[07:48:03] <Cork> it is a way of constructing your code
[07:48:05] <Cork> not only
[07:48:27] <Cork> you can do it in js, php, ruby (rails), python, .net and so on
[07:48:39] <caliel> Cork: I am developing the page mobile-first, so I am adding snippets. But if a single image doesn't load with append, how can I ever lazyload a whole bunch of <div>s for the gallery ? :(
[07:48:47] <joroci> yea obviously
[07:49:03] <joroci> guess i would go with php or mvc
[07:49:05] <joroci> .net
[07:49:17] <Cork> my experience is that .net doesn't scale
[07:49:27] <joroci> what do you mean?
[07:49:45] <Cork> if you ever plan to have more then just a few users
[07:49:56] <Cork> it will most likely have performance problems
[07:50:13] <astropirate> joroci, he means you need more webscale to grow the synergy in your sprint cycles of the iterative cycle for maximum growth and user retention
[07:50:23] <Cork> though that can be said for a lot of server frameworks
[07:50:39] <joroci> well it won't be for many users anyway
[07:50:39] <Cork> node, rails to name two
[07:50:43] <joroci> 10 tops
[07:50:54] <Cork> joroci: then do it in what ever language is the fastest
[07:50:57] <astropirate> node.js doesn't scale well beyond hello world applciation
[07:50:58] <astropirate> :)
[07:51:01] <Cork> to develop that is
[07:51:02] <astropirate> #truefact
[07:51:16] <Cork> joroci: for 10 users you can't really get overload problems
[07:51:22] <joroci> yea i know
[07:51:40] <Cork> unless you code REALLY poorly that is :P
[07:51:45] <gnu_d> Cork: it works, however it gives me 4 objects i.e mutations, each are style related, how do I know they're from node remove ?
[07:52:03] <joroci> so what will be faster .net or php if you are familiar with both
[07:52:16] <Cork> gnu_d: i don't know what your trying to do
[07:52:32] <Cork> i just saw your comment about DOMNodeRemove
[07:52:46] <gnu_d> Cork: I'm trying to wait the load mask to be removed, when it's removed to do something
[07:52:50] <caliel> Ok. Cork I have just added an alert("Something"); in the code. Well, it doesn't load at all in IE8 / IE7. No alert at all....
[07:52:53] <joroci> gnu_d when you create the observe you add your target
[07:53:00] <joroci> so you know it's the right target
[07:53:12] <Cork> caliel: suspected as much
[07:53:19] <Cork> caliel: so prob parsing error
[07:53:54] <gnu_d> joroci: yes but, how do I know it's removed, thinking about it I don't modify it, the next action is remove, ok, I'm good
[07:54:41] <Cork> gnu_d: check for the removedNodes from the mutationrecord
[07:55:07] <gnu_d> Cork: well, since this is the last node, there no node to remove
[07:55:45] <Cork> uh
[07:56:20] <Cork> MutationObserver(function(mutations) { mutations.removedNodes })
[07:56:51] <Cork> if it is null the mutation didn't remove anything
[07:57:05] <astropirate> var Xavier = MutationObserver
[07:57:42] <Cork> gnu_d: check the documentation on dmo it is quite good
[07:57:52] <gnu_d> Cork: undefined, but it works
[07:58:19] <Cork> ...
[07:58:25] <Cork> "Return the nodes removed, or null." oook...
[07:58:36] <Cork> :)
[07:59:54] <raj> is it worth adding 5,000 or 10,000 elements to the DOM if it'll make my code look cleaner?
[08:00:09] <Cork> uh... most likely no
[08:00:21] <Cork> the dom becomes slower the more elements you add
[08:00:33] <Cork> and 10000 is quite a bit of nodes
[08:00:49] <raj> ya, that's actually an over estimation
[08:00:51] <waflessnet> hola alguien usa datatable jquery ?
[08:00:58] <raj> but the elements have attributes ands tuff
[08:01:11] <raj> maybe 1000 elements
[08:01:30] <waflessnet> saben como se llama la funcion que permite avanzar automaticamente por las paginas ?
[08:01:39] <Cork> waflessnet: english plese
[08:01:50] <waflessnet> :c
[08:01:53] <raj> so I should build templates using jquery, and not just have them sitting in the DOM?
[08:01:58] <Cork> raj: 1000 is better, but if it is 1000 + what you already have...
[08:02:18] <Cork> raj: for that amount of data ya
[08:02:24] <Cork> or just ajax load the html
[08:02:29] <raj> ya, cuz I'm trying to modularize stuff
[08:02:43] <raj> I am ajax loading the html
[08:02:48] <raj> but once it's loaded, it stays there
[08:03:09] <Cork> might be worth thinking over that then :)
[08:03:47] <Cork> heh that reminded me of someone a few days ago that wanted to store images and videos in localStorage...
[08:04:06] <raj> it has space like that?
[08:04:14] <Cork> no :)
[08:04:22] <Cork> and if it did it would kill performance
[08:04:37] <Cork> as the browser has to actually keep the localStorage database in memory
[08:04:44] <raj> oh
[08:04:48] <raj> interesting :)
[08:04:58] <Cork> so you would have to hold the base64 encoded video in ram
[08:05:03] <Cork> yay...
[08:05:07] <joroci> what text editor do you use?
[08:05:13] <Cork> sublime
[08:05:19] <joroci> yea me too
[08:05:26] <joroci> is it the best?
[08:05:33] <raj> is base64 some video encoding standard?
[08:05:33] <Cork> one of at least
[08:05:43] <Cork> ?g wiki base64
[08:05:44] <b-ot> Cork: Base64 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64
[08:05:48] <Cork> raj: no
[08:05:55] <raj> i mean, does video exclusively use base64
[08:05:59] <raj> , not the other way around
[08:05:59] <Cork> no
[08:06:15] <Cork> raj: base64 is basically a way to store binary data as valid text
[08:06:34] <Cork> as a result it makes the data ~ 33% bigger
[08:06:36] <raj> I've base64 encoded text before
[08:07:00] <Cork> raj: localstorage is only for strings
[08:07:06] <raj> gotcha
[08:07:09] <Cork> so if you want to store binary data in there
[08:07:11] <Cork> ...
[08:07:15] <raj> understood
[08:07:25] <raj> thanks for the fun fact :)
[08:08:40] <caliel> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/152135/ <- i can't find any parse error. The code is working on FX / IE9 - Going mad. Please note that I followed your suggestion: I load the script and the css in a conditional comment.
[08:08:45] <raj> Cork, ftr, you prefer building nested DOM elements in js?
[08:10:20] <Cork> raj: no, it is quite slow
[08:10:26] <cubud> Hi all
[08:10:36] <Cork> done that been there left there :)
[08:10:43] <raj> OH!
[08:11:03] <Cork> though templating is quite speedy
[08:11:25] <Cork> but it adds complexity that is hard to defend
[08:11:35] <Cork> when just straight html pushed from the server is so fast
[08:12:05] <raj> well, I'm already using a templating engine
[08:12:19] <raj> and I already load pages using ajax
[08:12:35] <Cork> caliel: i don't see any problems there no
[08:12:51] <Cork> caliel: though i do get a tick from all the missing brackets :)
[08:12:58] <raj> so essentially, I just need to include a div that contains all the templates I could possibly need for that page
[08:13:09] <Cork> caliel: but put some debug code in and see how far ie comes
[08:13:20] <caliel> Cork: uh, missing brackets ?
[08:13:20] <cubud> I have applied .sortable() to a listview.  Rather than doing Ajax each time an item index is updated I wanted to do a single ajax call at the end.  My <form> values are still posted in the same order
[08:13:29] <cubud> Not even sure how to ask the question tbh :)
[08:13:42] <Cork> caliel:  for ( var i = 0; i < images.length; ++i) \n $()
[08:13:55] <Cork> caliel: but it is just a styling opinion :)
[08:14:08] <caliel> Cork: ah, phew.
[08:14:52] <Cork> i've seen too many bugs from not adding them to like that kind of code
[08:15:10] <Cork> (just as much as i hate implicit returns)
[08:15:43] <joroci> Cork would you use a js library for this or go with pure javascript?
[08:16:08] <raj> I have a feeling, this might change my world
[08:17:50] <caliel> Cork: ok. But I don't know what to do.
[08:18:11] <Cork> caliel: as older ie sucks to debug
[08:18:16] <Cork> just comment out the js
[08:18:21] <Cork> and see if a line of js runs
[08:18:24] <Cork> if it does
[08:18:41] <Cork> start enable a section/line at a time until it stops working
[08:18:51] <Cork> and narrow down where it breaks
[08:18:58] <bigbugjava> hi, Need help with Datatables, I mean I need to display an object into datatable. any1 here can help with how?
[08:20:23] <Cork> cubud: so you want to know if there is an event for that or what?
[08:21:29] <cubud> Ah screw it, I'll just do one update per drop :)
[08:21:51] <Cork> cubud: just use a timer, clear it on each update
[08:21:54] <caliel> Cork ok I will set some breakpoints.
[08:22:00] <Cork> and after the delay push it to the server
[08:22:12] <Cork> cubud: that should reduce the number of calls a lot
[08:22:33] <Cork> caliel: eh, i wouldn't trust the developer tools in ie
[08:22:41] <Cork> at least not ie < 10
[08:22:47] <Cork> and preferably not ie < 11
[08:25:37] <hfp> Hi, I am writing a plugin for jQuery and one of my selectors is $(this, parameters.selector). However, it doesn't work. How can I write a selector for both this and the selector contained in parameters.selector? Thanks!
[08:26:35] <Cork> hfp: $(this).find(parameters.selector) or $(parameters.selector, this)
[08:26:49] <Cork> not $(this, parameters.selector)
[08:26:58] <caliel> Cork: if it would be me to choose, I won't develop for IE at all.
[08:27:15] <Cork> caliel: i'm ok with newer ie's
[08:27:19] <hfp> Thanks Cork, let me try
[08:27:33] <Cork> but ya luckely the projects i work with normally accept ie>8 support
[08:27:39] <Cork> and ie9 is ok to get working
[08:28:47] <caliel> Cork: yes, I don't know if this is correct, but I am trying to load everything at the very end of the file, via JS. So I prepared a style loaded with <noscript> that is the minimum linear style. Everything is supposed to work with js.
[08:29:15] <Cork> caliel: ouch
[08:29:31] <cubud> Thanks!
[08:31:46] <caliel> Cork: point number one. With IE8, the script is loaded, the stylesheet (loaded via script as you can see here http://bpaste.net/show/152135/ no. Eventually, I know that alert("IE sucks!"); works, so the script is loaded. The rest of the stuff no.
[08:33:30] <caliel> I put an alert("loading Link" + url); in the loadLink function. IE8 only loads the favicon, then stops.
[08:34:07] <Cork> hmm
[08:34:26] <Cork> not sure why but i keep remembering document.head[0].appendChild
[08:34:56] <caliel> Cork: I am using document.head.appendChild without indexing. I will try using the index.
[08:35:25] <caliel> obviously it's not defined :D
[08:35:49] <jop008> if I have a long select field the background becomes dark how to avoid this?
[08:36:13] <Cork> caliel: and if you skip the icon?
[08:37:21] <caliel> Cork: if I skip the icon (done) the alert says "Loading css/style.css", but no style is applied to the document.
[08:37:42] <Cork> eeh...
[08:38:06] <Cork> caliel: though i would't move css to lazy loading
[08:38:18] <Cork> it forces the browser to redraw the entire page again
[08:38:37] <caliel> so it would be a waste of time
[08:38:44] <Cork> the icon isn't blocking so that one is a bit pointless
[08:39:09] <Cork> caliel: well moving scripts to the bottom is worth it if you hunt for speed
[08:39:17] <Cork> initial loading speed that is
[08:39:25] <caliel> Ok Cork I will avoid lazy loading of stylesheet.
[08:39:27] <hfp> Cork: I made a mistake. my selector is this, not $(this). I need to combine it with parameters.selector. $(parameters,selector, this) refers to something different than this, $(parameters.selector)
[08:39:32] <Cork> but css and icon...
[08:40:11] <caliel> Ok we'll solve this :P
[08:40:14] <Cork> hfp: uh..
[08:40:27] <Cork> hfp: ok what is "this"?
[08:42:10] <hfp> Cork: I am within the scope of the plugin, so as far as I understand, this would be $(this) if it wasn't a plugin. I call it with $('.bar').plugin({selector: ".foo"), so in that case, this withing the plugin is $('.class'). Am I understanding correctly?
[08:42:36] <hfp> Maybe I should whip up a jsFiddle?
[08:43:18] <caliel> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/152140/
[08:44:15] <caliel> Cork: maybe the solution is there, but I would like to apply that having a src, not text.
[08:44:57] <Cork> hfp: then you do this.find(parameters.selector)
[08:45:21] <hfp> Cork: Thanks, I'll try
[08:45:56] <Cork> caliel: wait what?
[08:45:59] <jop008> Can you influence the black background for long select lists? Now it becomes black
[08:46:18] <caliel> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/152140/
[08:46:33] <Cork> caliel: ya i saw that
[08:46:41] <Cork> but i don't really get what you want to do
[08:46:45] <caliel> Cork: IE8 reads the script I put at the very end of the file. But it cannot load jQuery.
[08:46:50] <Cork> you want to create an inline script tag?
[08:47:43] <Cork> caliel: not sure older ie supports getElementsByTagName
[08:47:54] <Cork> ?mdn document.getElementsByTagName
[08:47:55] <b-ot> Cork: document.getElementsByTagName - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.getElementsByTagName
[08:48:12] <caliel> Cork: that was a file you gave me yesterday (How to load script and style dynamically).
[08:48:25] <Cork> hmm
[08:48:32] <Cork> no ie supports it since 5.5
[08:48:35] <caliel> Cork: the problem is: IE8 goes inside the script. But it doesn't load jQuery.
[08:49:16] <Cork> caliel: inside what script?
[08:49:49] <aboudreault> if my jquery element is an array, can I bind all of them for the event click, with a function? will I have each individual element as argument ?
[08:50:24] <caliel> Cork: http://bpaste.net/show/152142/ <--- this. Loaded before </body>
[08:50:27] <Cork> aboudreault: you can just run it straight of
[08:50:43] <Cork> aboudreault: they will loop they on there own
[08:50:56] <aboudreault> this means yes?
[08:51:07] <Cork> aboudreault: yes, no need for an extra loop
[08:51:10] <aboudreault> ok
[08:51:12] <aboudreault> thx
[08:51:56] <Cork> caliel: do you mean the load callback never fires?
[08:52:03] <caliel> Cork: yes.
[08:52:07] <Cork> ah
[08:52:09] <caliel> Cork: sorry for my bad English.
[08:53:07] <Cork> ugg looks like older ie's has a bugged onload for script tags >_<
[08:53:33] <caliel> Cork: there is some bugfix / patch / hack ?
[08:53:40] <Cork> caliel: one min
[08:53:46] <caliel> Cork: even 10. :)
[08:54:22] <caliel> (although, this is an interesting issue)
[08:57:12] <Cork> caliel: try this one http://bpaste.net/show/oBfn9lSyHElu7n8ktBQG/
[08:57:52] <hfp> Cork: Thank, it worked. This however triggered a question... within a plugin, this and $(this) refer to different things. What about this.find(selector) and $(this.find(selector)) ? Are they equivalent?
[08:57:59] <hfp> Thanks*
[08:59:21] <Cork> hfp: inside a plugin this is jquery
[08:59:34] <Cork> if you wrap jquery with $() you get the same object
[08:59:37] <caliel> Cork: no, it doesn't work :)
[09:00:06] <hfp> Cork: so you're saying this and $(this) are equivalent in a plugin?
[09:00:24] <Cork> so $($($($('.selector')))) is the same thing as $('.selector')
[09:00:45] <Cork> hfp: well $(this) isn't one thing
[09:00:49] <grafi> except for more bling
[09:00:50] <grafi> :P
[09:00:54] <Cork> ya
[09:01:08] <Cork> $(this) is "this" passed to the function $()
[09:01:28] <grafi> thats why bling.js  always wraps $($($($($()))))
[09:01:38] <Cork> and if what was passed in wasn't already a jquery object it will wrap it
[09:03:38] <caliel> Cork: maybe the only solution is to give up and load jQuery (a minified version of jQuery-1.x + migrate plugin) and then a core.js for other stuffs.
[09:04:01] <hfp> Ok, so for consistency's sake, I might as well use $(this) and $(this.find('.lala') everywhere in my jQuery and even in the plugins, correct?
[09:04:08] <caliel> Cork: but I think there is another solution to let IE8 wait for jQuery to load before doing things.
[09:04:25] <Cork> caliel: i have loaded libs this way so not sure why it fails for you
[09:04:28] <Cork> (in ie)
[09:04:52] <scar2> whats the bst way to grab all elements with a specific attr?
[09:05:06] <scar2> $('*[foo=bar]) ?
[09:05:08] <caliel> Cork: I don't know. Maybe there's something wrong with the callback. But really I would like to have just one script that manages everything else.
[09:05:13] <Cork> hfp: well yes for simple plugins, but it will break if you do it for ex. jquery ui plugins
[09:05:43] <Cork> hfp: i would recommend to just leave this as the pointer for jquery inside the plugin (first level)
[09:06:12] <Cork> scar2: ya, basically
[09:06:22] <scar2> seems highly inefficient
[09:06:22] <Cork> there is no "good" way to do it
[09:06:23] <scar2> oh well
[09:06:26] <hfp> Cork: Understood. What about this.find('.class'), should I leave it as is or put it inside $() ?
[09:06:26] <Cork> it is
[09:06:33] <scar2> ill just set ids or classes instead lol
[09:06:42] <Cork> hfp: this.find is just fine
[09:07:13] <Cork> scar2: that said i actually usually use something like that my self
[09:07:39] <Cork> $(docuent).on('click', '[href^="http"]', function() {})
[09:07:47] <hfp> Cork: Thanks
[09:08:11] <Cork> uh
[09:08:46] <Cork> scar2: a simple way to make it more efficient is actually to just do $('a[href=""]')
[09:08:47] <scar2> Cork, i have a js/jquery intensive site, and theres no page reloads, but i create token/nonces for proper security/validation-- but these nonces expire and need to be updated frequently (there's only about 12 spots that need updating) and i was trying to figure out the best way to call a function to update them all, etc
[09:08:54] <Cork> cause then you at least only check the a tags
[09:09:01] <scar2> hrm
[09:09:16] <scar2> true, but some actions aren't all anchors unfortunately
[09:09:25] <scar2> some are forms, when the form is submitted for example
[09:09:31] <Cork> scar2: why not just store the tocken
[09:09:39] <Cork> and on click modify the url before it fires
[09:09:46] <Cork> it THINK you are allowed to do that
[09:10:06] <Cork> scar2: that would be for submit though
[09:10:06] <scar2> well, for example, an ajax call is used on every click. so when u click "Clients" in the navigation it will use that nonce stored in the foo-data-nonce="" attr
[09:10:18] <scar2> i would pass the nonce via hidden input anyway
[09:10:26] <Cork> scar2: uh...
[09:10:26] <scar2> but as time goes on... that nonce eventually will expire for "Clients"
[09:10:40] <scar2> uh what? lol
[09:10:47] <caliel> Cork: I "solved" with this workaround: I load jQuery separately, then the core.js script :(
[09:10:48] <Cork> sounds like you should have kept one value per user or page load
[09:10:52] <Cork> instead of one per link
[09:11:14] <scar2> Cork, hrm... i didnt think of that, but i was trying to be more secure in having separate nonces for separate actions
[09:11:22] <Cork> caliel: sorry that i couldn't help but i can't test as i don't have the needed ie at hand
[09:11:32] <scar2> hrmmmm i might go that route...
[09:11:45] <Cork> scar2: i don't see where you get security
[09:11:51] <Cork> just complexity :)
[09:11:55] <scar2> true
[09:12:05] <scar2> well, im thinkin across the board not just this one question
[09:12:07] <caliel> Cork: sorry for what ? You helped me. Thanks. :) - Is Bill sorry for the virus he created ? :P No.
[09:12:17] <Cork> i normally set a meta tag in the header with a tocken
[09:12:22] <scar2> i wanna make sure a nonce used to update your own profile isnt used to edit a client you dont have access to, etc
[09:12:31] <Cork> and then have a click and submit handler that just includes it
[09:12:44] <scar2> i know permissions are good for this instance, but was jus an example
[09:12:48] <scar2> hmmm
[09:12:51] <scar2> 1 nonce for all actions?
[09:13:03] <Cork> well rather for the user for one action
[09:13:10] <Cork> when one action happens it is expired
[09:13:23] <Cork> and a new one is sent pack and you store that for the next one
[09:13:40] <scar2> hm
[09:17:04] <sasmit87> Hi all
[09:17:41] <sasmit87> Can somebody tell me what is the exact difference between jquery on and delegate method
[09:19:24] <Cork> sasmit87: the order of the arguments
[09:19:47] <Cork> and that on supports both bind and delegate bindings
[09:21:35] <sasmit87> what about delegate then??
[09:22:22] <Jayflux> Whats the new warning about preventDefault?
[09:22:25] <Jayflux> all about
[09:22:41] <Velveeta> i believe it'll be gone when 1.11 is released
[09:22:49] <Velveeta> i think it's a chrome change itself
[09:23:25] <Cork> sasmit87: $().delegate('selector', 'event', func) is the EXACT same thing as $().on('event', 'selector', func)
[09:23:51] <Cork> sasmit87: $().bind('event', func) is the same thing as $().on('event', func)
[09:24:19] <sasmit87> what goes inside $()
[09:24:33] <Cork> sasmit87: the element that the function should work on
[09:24:40] <Cork> for bind it is the target
[09:24:52] <sasmit87> okay.. great
[09:24:54] <Cork> for delegate it is a parent that is always around
[09:25:10] <sasmit87> okay..and for on same also
[09:25:23] <Cork> well on it depends on what effect you want
[09:25:47] <sasmit87> example
[09:26:33] <Cork> $('a').live('click', func) === $(document).delegate('a', 'click', func) === $(document).on('click', 'a', func)
[09:26:57] <sasmit87> wahh .. great :)
[09:27:06] <sasmit87> now I am understanding
[09:27:19] <Cork> $('a').bind('click', func) === $('a').click(func) === $('a').on('click', func)
[09:28:04] <sasmit87> but in delegate 3 parameters are mandatory i guess
[09:28:08] <shoky> should put those in the topic
[09:28:18] <Cork> sasmit87: same for on if you want the delegate effect
[09:28:27] <sasmit87> okay
[09:28:46] <sasmit87> which method is better and why ??
[09:28:57] <sasmit87> I guess delegate
[09:29:10] <Cork> sasmit87: live is deperecated and remove so it isn't even an option
[09:29:17] <sasmit87> okay
[09:29:24] <Cork> delegate and bind is just tiny wrapper functions around on now days
[09:29:32] <Cork> (compatibility for older scripts)
[09:29:38] <sasmit87> ok
[09:29:40] <Cork> but there isn't really a difference
[09:29:44] <Cork> so you can use either
[09:29:59] <Cork> pick the one you find easiest to read
[09:30:12] <sasmit87> so I can use any of those 3 methods
[09:30:17] <sasmit87> right?
[09:30:22] <Cork> yes
[09:30:30] <Cork> bind, click, delegate and on
[09:30:31] <Cork> all works
[09:30:35] <Cork> live is dead
[09:30:39] <Cork> :)
[09:30:44] <Cork> no pun intended
[09:30:47] <sasmit87> it was there in 1.7
[09:30:52] <Cork> ya
[09:30:57] <Cork> it was deprecated in 1.5
[09:30:59] <Cork> and removed in 1.9
[09:31:05] <sasmit87> okay
[09:31:39] <sasmit87> but 1 advantage is there in case of delegate over bind
[09:31:57] <Cork> there is many
[09:32:11] <Cork> you can handle an infinite list of elements with one event handler
[09:32:21] <Cork> instead of adding one event listener to every element
[09:32:33] <sasmit87> that is lets say $(div).delegate('a span label','click',function)
[09:32:45] <Cork> that generates a BIT performance difference if you have many elmeents as targets
[09:32:58] <Cork> bit==big
[09:33:03] <sasmit87> You mean better formance or poor
[09:33:19] <sasmit87> if many as target
[09:33:30] <Cork> the fewer event listeners you add to the dom the faster it is
[09:33:57] <sasmit87> I am adding only one that is click
[09:34:03] <sasmit87> but 3 targetss
[09:34:08] <sasmit87> *target
[09:34:33] <Cork> then you add 3 not 1 :)
[09:34:35] <sasmit87> and in bind case I need to write 3 times
[09:34:54] <Cork> $('*').click(func) adds one event listener to every element in the page
[09:35:04] <sasmit87> okay
[09:35:16] <Cork> $(document).delegate('*', 'click',func) adds one
[09:35:27] <Cork> though the selector is a bit silly
[09:35:30] <izanagisan-afk> hi all. I thoguht I was going crazy but the content in my page is changing AFTER the jquery $(document).ready() method is executed. The result is that jquery correctly calculates DIV widths, but then those widths change.
[09:35:31] <sasmit87> for each elemnt
[09:35:53] <sasmit87> * will be very slow I guess perfomance wise
[09:35:53] <Cork> sasmit87: no delegate adds just one
[09:36:00] <Cork> ah
[09:36:01] <Cork> yes
[09:36:28] <sasmit87> how delegate adds one
[09:36:48] <sasmit87> if I click any of the element it has to listen
[09:36:49] <Cork> cause event bubble and has a context that the browser needs to keep around and update beside the dom
[09:37:15] <Cork> sasmit87: delegate works by having a parent and from one listener on it check for bubbling events
[09:37:42] <Cork> and then check if the original target of the event matches the selector you gave
[09:37:43] <sasmit87> did not understand
[09:37:50] <sasmit87> 1 min
[09:38:02] <izanagisan> I don't really know what's going on or how to avoid it. It's like some content REFUSED to load and have its final width/height before the $(document).ready() method executed. Has anyone had this problem before??. It's somewhat difficult to Google
[09:38:12] <Cork> the original target is event.target, and the event object keeps it around
[09:38:19] <coderhut> Hi,  I have three multiselect dropdowns using this jquery plugin  http://www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget How can I show/hide a certain multiselect id dropdown?
[09:39:33] <Cork> caliel: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6806584/object-onload-in-internet-explorer-6-7-and-8
[09:40:40] <caliel> Cork: thanks, again. For this work I will do like this. (The speed performance on Google PageSpeed and YSlow has improved not deferring the CSS, though, thanks!)
[09:40:52] <caliel> Cork: working mobile-first is harder than desktop-first approach.
[09:40:54] <sasmit87> Cork: one example please what you described about delegate
[09:41:06] <Cork> caliel: ya, been there
[09:41:37] <Cork> sasmit87: well the example i gave you before used document
[09:41:42] <caliel> Cork: but I think that is the correct approach. No polyfills, just fill when needed.
[09:41:45] <caliel> :D
[09:41:47] <Cork> sasmit87: that is the top most element in the document
[09:41:53] <sasmit87> ok then
[09:42:10] <Cork> caliel: the hard part with mobile is the buggy browsers
[09:42:20] <Cork> and there are A LOT of those
[09:42:37] <Cork> sasmit87: when you bind delegate you actually add the event on document
[09:42:47] <sasmit87> okay
[09:42:52] <sasmit87> then
[09:42:57] <Cork> and then the delegate function checks event.target against the selector you give it
[09:43:02] <Cork> ex 'a' in this case
[09:43:07] <izanagisan> anyone had a similar problem to mine?
[09:43:09] <Cork> if it matches it fires your callback
[09:43:37] <Cork> sasmit87: so when you click an a tag the click bubbles up from the a tag through the different parents until it reaches docuemtn
[09:43:39] <sasmit87> okay..
[09:43:45] <Cork> and it reacts on the event
[09:43:47] <izanagisan> an alert() right at the beggining of $(document).ready() reveals that some of the DOM content has not yet been loaded or has not gotten all its CSS properties. Although other CSS properties are already loaded
[09:44:27] <Cork> izanagisan: have you validated the page?
[09:44:43] <Cork> ?g w3c validate
[09:44:44] <b-ot> Cork: The W3C Markup Validation Service → http://validator.w3.org/
[09:45:09] <caliel> Cork: where can I check for those browsers ? Is there some browsershots alternative for mobiles ? or a Linux software / Firefox plugin ? Because I do everything in FX.
[09:45:25] <sasmit87> so in this case $(div).delegate('a span label','click',function)
[09:45:37] <Cork> caliel: some of them are listed and commonly known
[09:45:47] <sasmit87> any of the 3 target I click it has to bubble till the div
[09:45:58] <Cork> caliel: i used a lot of emulators and tested the different ones
[09:46:07] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'dataTable' - I do load jquery datatables..anyone knows why?
[09:46:09] <Cork> caliel: and iphone is by far the buggiest
[09:46:11] <izanagisan> Cork: no, I haven't. It's a Symfony2 page created with the Twig templating engine
[09:46:25] <izanagisan> I made sure CSS stylesheets are loaded BEFORE the jquery script
[09:46:32] <Cork> the built in android browser is a tiny bit better but still sucks
[09:46:49] <Cork> caliel: and if you go to older versions...
[09:46:55] <Cork> that is NOT fun at all...
[09:46:57] <izanagisan> but still some elements 'shrink' or change after all the $(document).ready() code has been executed
[09:47:07] <Cork> there the simplest things brake
[09:47:39] <Cork> like something like borders or margins just doesn't work as it should
[09:47:41] <caliel> Cork: where could I find the list of common issues ?
[09:47:56] <Cork> caliel: not sure there is a list
[09:48:14] <Cork> caliel: the most commonly known problem i know of is form elements and position: fixed
[09:48:41] <coderhut> Hi,  I have a multiselect dropdown using this jquery plugin  http://www.erichynds.com/blog/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget How can I show/hide this multiselect dropdown using its id?
[09:48:46] <Cork> position: fixed is REALLY broken in even quite new mobile versions
[09:49:02] <caliel> Cork: when a customer asks me : "Oh, are you really going to bill this ? You just have to copy paste contents." I would like to scream.
[09:49:05] <caliel> ahahah
[09:49:14] <jarray52> When using JQuery Reveal on IE8, the entire background becomes black as opposed to translucent. Is there a way to fix this that anyone has devised?
[09:49:18] <caliel> clients from hell. more than true.
[09:49:19] <Cork> and form elements have overlays that you actually edit in and that causes ghost events and other weird problems
[09:49:40] <caliel> Cork: what emulators could you suggest me ?
[09:49:46] <sasmit87> Cork: whats wrong here ??   http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=rAgJqblpzB
[09:49:53] <Cork> caliel: well for iphone there is just one
[09:51:05] <Cork> caliel: so if you need iphone xcode is the only option (and that means you MUCH own a mac)
[09:51:14] <Cork> caliel: the emulator is quite good though
[09:51:26] <Cork> caliel: android is simpler it has a good emualtor suite
[09:51:43] <Cork> caliel: simplest is firefox os, it is just an extension for firefox :)
[09:51:59] <Cork> but exist as a 32 and 64bit program too
[09:52:19] <Cork> http://developer.android.com/sdk/
[09:53:03] <izanagisan> Cork: I'm blaming the fonts. It's like it loaded them AFTER the $(document).ready() method. Because that's the only change I detect
[09:53:23] <Cork> izanagisan: are you using webfonts?
[09:53:29] <caliel> Cork: i will never own a Mac.
[09:53:32] <Cork> in other words are you using @font-face
[09:53:42] <Cork> caliel: same here :)
[09:53:47] <Cork> but i do have one at hand at work
[09:54:02] <caliel> Cork: where are you from ?
[09:54:06] <Cork> sweden
[09:54:19] <sasmit87> I am from India
[09:54:31] <caliel> Italy here.
[09:55:00] <caliel> Cork: I will try some emulators, of course I cannot buy all the stuff :D
[09:55:01] <sasmit87> but somebody help me here http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=rAgJqblpzB
[09:55:20] <jedimind> caliel emulators for what?
[09:55:30] <jedimind> mobile devices ?

[09:55:41] <jedimind> who needs emulators, thats my desk
[09:56:12] <caliel> jedimind: lot of stuff there :D
[09:57:13] <izanagisan> AJA! it was the fonts loaded in CSS with @font-face. Even being on the server itself, they loaded AFTER $(document).ready()
[09:57:23] <izanagisan> and made stuff change on my page
[09:57:31] <caliel> I just don't like that apple sign, it would be better a fat penguin....
[09:57:34] <caliel> ^^
[09:58:02] <Cork> jedimind: lol nice one :)
[09:58:30] <gregf_> hi, i needed to prevent a user from entering a value <= 0 using javascript or jquery(without using any plugin). would it be possible please?
[09:58:42] <gregf_> *users
[09:59:37] <Cork> caliel: well for me it is mostly there policy i can't live with
[09:59:52] <Cork> caliel: but there over prices doesn't help
[09:59:53] <HasBeenBlahBlag> парни вы русские?
[09:59:57] <HasBeenBlahBlag> вов
[09:59:59] <HasBeenBlahBlag> видимо нет
[10:00:05] <Cork> HasBeenBlahBlag: english please
[10:00:11] <caliel> Cork: sorry I did not understand... you can't live without Macs ?
[10:00:27] <HasBeenBlahBlag> Cork да ты ахуел совсем? Указывать мне еще будешь
[10:00:29] <Cork> caliel: the policies from apple
[10:00:48] <caliel> oh, ok. I don't believe in the Apple system.
[10:00:56] <sasmit87> why this is not working as expected http://jsfiddle.net/LZwuJ/
[10:01:35] <Cork> caliel: well there system isn't that bad, but 1. competitors is not allowed, 2. you don't really own your device, 3. open source isn't really allowed
[10:01:37] <Cork> and so on
[10:01:50] <caliel> the 3rd point scares me
[10:02:04] <Cork> well apache license is ok
[10:02:15] <Cork> but there is a bad or close to a ban on gpl
[10:02:44] <caliel> I will not sing the Free software song by R.S.
[10:02:50] <caliel> :D
[10:03:20] <Cork> sasmit87: http://jsfiddle.net/LZwuJ/2/
[10:03:30] <Cork> opps
[10:03:38] <Cork> *there is a ban or close to*
[10:04:21] <Cork> caliel: ever wondered why there isn't competing browsers on ios?
[10:04:25] <sasmit87> Cork: thanks I was missing cooma
[10:04:32] <Cork> +s :)
[10:04:34] <sasmit87> comma
[10:04:37] <Cork> 2 of them :D
[10:04:45] <caliel> Cork: because of point 1 of your previous statement :D
[10:04:48] <HasBeenBlahBlag> ай ам труинг джейквери энд релоад э падге нот подключимамбле
[10:04:53] <caliel> "competitors is not allowed"
[10:05:03] <HasBeenBlahBlag> +ы
[10:05:04] <HasBeenBlahBlag> +s
[10:05:16] <Cork> caliel: yup only apples js ending and rendering engine is allowed
[10:05:42] <Cork> so chrome on ios is basically safarie - jit comilation with a new theme
[10:05:46] <caliel> Cork: it's for that I will never buy an iPhone - Nexus is the way.
[10:05:48] <Cork> *safari
[10:06:11] <Cork> caliel: android isn't much better sadly
[10:06:12] <caliel> But it would be a religious flame. Mine thought is mine, not good, not right.
[10:06:33] <caliel> Cork: well I know. But as said, it could be a matter of religion.
[10:06:37] <sasmit87> Cork: each time I click on a or label or span, the event has to bubble till div#main
[10:06:40] <sasmit87> right?
[10:06:55] <Cork> caliel: well much of android today isn't open source
[10:07:05] <Cork> and the open source parts isn't maintained
[10:07:07] <caliel> Cork: because of S.Jobs.
[10:07:27] <caliel> I will try to root my device and install ubuntu for mobiles.
[10:07:35] <Cork> well no cause google has replaced the opensource components with close source replacements
[10:07:50] <Cork> talk (open) > hangout (closed)
[10:07:58] <Cork> browser (open) > chrome (closed)
[10:08:18] <caliel> This way information will never be really free.
[10:08:27] <Cork> youtube, maps and a few others has gone the same troute
[10:08:32] <Cork> *route
[10:08:42] <HasBeenBlahBlag> #russiatoday
[10:09:01] <Cork> caliel: that is why all compeditors has had to reimplement there own version of those apps in there phones
[10:09:02] <caliel> I can understand not giving the Google algorithm, but important software has to be updated and free.
[10:09:22] <Cork> like samsung and htc
[10:09:30] <caliel> Cork: of course it's a lot of work out there. But it has not to be a pure matter of money.
[10:09:48] <Cork> ya
[10:10:18] <caliel> It's too much headache for who develops.
[10:10:22] <Cork> i'm still waiting for a really open and free os for the phone
[10:10:46] <sasmit87> what phone you use
[10:10:46] <caliel> Cork: what do you think about http://www.ubuntu.com/phone
[10:11:11] <Cork> sasmit87: i'm still on an old unlocked android 2.3 :)
[10:11:22] <Cork> full root access is nice :D
[10:11:24] <sasmit87> me too
[10:11:40] <caliel> sasmit87: I have an old Samsung :D I am going to choose the next device and I am oriented on Nexus 5.
[10:11:56] <caliel> But I am still waiting, because I have no clear ideas about that.
[10:12:08] <sasmit87> mine is a samsung now
[10:12:12] <Cork> was offered an upgrade, but i lost interest when i was told that expantion memory was not supported anymore
[10:12:55] <Cork> and i have no intention of storing my stuff on googles servers
[10:13:30] <sasmit87> whats wrong with google servers
[10:13:52] <Cork> sasmit87: well i have never liked googles interest in what i like and do
[10:14:07] <Cork> so i have always been sceptical to them
[10:14:10] <caliel> or facebook.
[10:14:24] <Cork> and with the nsa taping there data...
[10:14:30] <Cork> i'm happy i was
[10:15:53] <caliel> I complain times when men where men and (no, sorry, that was not me).... I complain the ZX Spectrum vs Commodore 64 times.
[10:16:56] <Cork> :)
[10:17:17] <murph> I've got a js array of elements (wrapped individually by jQuery). Can i convert that to a .. jquery array thing? (Like the return of a selector)
[10:17:22] <sasmit87> its gonna midnight here
[10:17:58] <Cork> murph: you mean you have something like [$(),$(),$(),$()] ?
[10:18:04] <murph> yeah
[10:18:13] <Cork> eh... why?
[10:18:20] <Cork> jquery is in it self an array
[10:18:26] <Cork> just add to it
[10:18:45] <murph> I basically was reordering the results of a selector. I guess poorly.
[10:18:47] <Cork> var arr = $(); arr = arr.add($())
[10:19:01] <murph> oh ok
[10:28:35] <ButtDog> I have a jquery/ajax uploader, it's firing right away once you select a file. Can I change it to fire when a button with an id of #upload_bttn is clicked?
[10:29:06] <ButtDog> http://dpaste.de/Y4yV
[10:30:42] <jop008> If i have this <a href=\"login.php\" id='search' title='Login' rel=\"external\" data-mini=\"true\" data-role=\"button\" data-icon=\"grid\" data-theme=\"b\">Logout<\/a>";
[10:30:53] <jop008> and want to use an icon how to do that?

[10:36:26] <neoromantique> Guys, how can I do double .animate?
[10:36:43] <neoromantique> e.g hover effect on this website http://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html
[10:36:46] <raj> neoromantique, use the callback function of .animate
[10:37:33] <neoromantique> Thanks
[10:40:55] <caliel> Cork: see you soon, thanks for your help.
[10:41:03] <caliel> jedimind: bye.

[10:47:59] <AntelopeSalad> if you had to loop through the dom in reverse and find the first instance of a certain element, would you write some recursive prev() loop or just attach a data attribute instead to the thing that would have required the prev loop's value?
[10:49:17] <jop008> any example on icon usage?
[10:49:34] <jop008> I want a button with the icon ui-icon-heart
[10:50:09] <jop008> I read this http://api.jqueryui.com/button/#option-icons
[10:54:53] <ss_haze> ok jquery people free opensource modal image windows ]
[10:58:41] <BillCriswell> ss_haze: Google will be more useful for that question.

[11:06:05] <Bloomberg> So I need to get the date of selected tab
[11:06:14] <jedimind> i dont understand how you're so incapable of following simple directions. literally every single fucking day you come in here sucking people's time, without ever once providing something for us to help you with
[11:06:22] <jedimind> ive told you to setup a test case at least 10 separate days now
[11:06:29] <jedimind> i have zero interest in helping you

[11:09:04] <jedimind> im not willing to help people who are not willing to learn
[11:09:26] <jedimind> as someone asking for help, do you not think that its in your best interest to follow a few basic rules that you get told every single day ?
[11:09:32] <jedimind> its simple, you want help, setup a testcase.
[11:09:38] <jedimind> dont make people work to help you, thats just fucking rude

[11:41:52] <mikunos> any help?
[11:42:23] <grafi> Greg_ sounds more like a css issue?
[11:42:38] <grafi> lacrymology what did you have in mind?
[11:42:47] <Greg_> I've tried removing any and all "overflow:hidden" and nothing seems to work
[11:43:27] <Greg_> I can remove the overflow-x: and it appears. but nothing involving overflow-y will allow any scrolling
[11:46:16] <lacrymology> grafi: YUIDoc, JSDoc, sphinx, ReST, Markdown... SOMETHING
[11:46:41] <lacrymology> LaTeX?
[11:46:50] <lacrymology> whatever
[11:46:54] <lacrymology> not plain html
[11:47:40] <grafi> doesnt it say something about markdown?
[11:48:01] <grafi> "All of the API sites use XML for their documentation, while most of the others use a combination of HTML and Markdown. Familiarizing yourself with Markdown is a good idea in general, and it would certainly facilitate your contributions to our sites. "

[12:03:15] <neoromantique> like medium

[12:04:06] <neoromantique> Thanks, it's perfect now
[12:04:12] <itra> Is there a way, on JQM, to use images as checkboxes?
[12:04:20] <itra> Like in a grid of checkboxes
[12:04:31] <eduayala> neoromantique: or you can pass the speed as int in ms, e.g. 400
[12:04:59] <neoromantique> eduayala, yes, I know, it's just that I didn't want to bother too much :) But, thanks anyway
[12:05:32] <eduayala> neoromantique: No prob :)

[12:51:07] <Twitler> Hello
[12:52:57] <ph88> hi
[12:58:06] <neoromantique> Guys, any ideas how to do transition like this one?
[12:58:07] <neoromantique> http://www.goldmansachs.com/index.html
[12:58:11] <neoromantique> (arrows on the sides)
[13:01:53] <ph88> neoromantique: looks like a custom build
[13:03:08] <BillCriswell> Anyone know of a webapp or something that's basically like anonymous list sharing? Whoever has a url can mark items off the list for the most part?
[13:07:28] <neoromantique> ph88, I think so, but I was talking about, how to build something like this? Perhaps how to do smooth movement?
[13:07:59] <ph88> neoromantique: they use this http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ and this http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/
[13:09:13] <faddah> neoromantique - in particular, look at jQuery UI (http://jqueryui.com), lots of things in there that will do the transition you want, even with all sorts of different inertia transitions.
[13:09:33] <faddah> and what ph88 sed.  ;)
[13:11:09] <neoromantique> Thanks
[13:11:45] <neoromantique> I am a little bit worried, that I have to use position:absolute; for that, but my website is built with Foundation
[13:11:49] <neoromantique> and its grid
[13:11:49] <ph88> neoromantique: check out Projects http://v3.desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry
[13:13:05] <neoromantique> Pixelate looks nice
[13:14:32] <neoromantique> By the way, Why is Easing better than css3 transitions?
[13:15:00] <jedimind> who says it is
[13:15:06] <jedimind> also the two arent necessarily entirel yrelated
[13:20:01] <ph88> neoromantique: i prefer CSS3 and you can define your own transitions in CSS3 too
[13:21:45] <neoromantique> Thanks for help! Doing it now

[14:15:04] <thesisb> If I have multiple classes in a page, ie: 'trackLink', should I bind an onclick on them through a body delegation or directly on them?  so $('body').on('click', '.trackLink'    vs $('.trackLink').on('click'
[14:15:05] <thesisb> ?
[14:16:00] <thesisb> And then what stops us from binding all class events from body if they can appear anywhere in a page using namespaces?  Is there a performance benefit?
[14:18:02] <NoiseEee> thesisb: its up to you, "body" tends to be a little high in the DOM for my taste, but you'd really only use a delegation if more of that class were going to be added dynamically and you wanted them to behave the same way

[14:33:52] <tilleps> Is there an event that fires when $.data has changed?  (looks like changeData event was removed)

[15:03:01] <hfp> Guys, I am at my witts end... When I copy paste my code in jsFiddle, it works fine. When I open it in my browser (Chrome), it doesn't work. I copy pasted the whole .html, .js and .css files in jsFiddle. What am I missing?
[15:04:05] <shoky> hfp: "doesn't work"?
[15:04:52] <jdunbaugh> I need to to attempt a slider that loads each element of content from my hidden block of html; the current jquery is for a different slider.  http://jsbin.com/anAHIwEm/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[15:06:02] <jdunbaugh> I'll need to use .animate somewhere to slide the images left and right
[15:06:49] <hfp> shoky: Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/cXa7R/ The fading effect on the top right image works perfectly in jsFiddle but not in any of my browsers (Chrome, FF)
[15:08:19] <hfp> shoky: In my browsers, the Decoder text appears and disappears but the image's opacity doesn't change. In jsFiddle it becomes darker as it should.
[15:15:15] <shoky> hfp: donno.. happy to take a look at the problem if you got a link ;p
[15:15:51] <hfp> shoky: The jsfiddle link I pasted is a copy paste from my .html .css and .js files
[15:16:26] <hfp> shoky: it is litteraly ctrl-a ctrl--c ctrl-v from minutes ago
[15:16:49] <shoky> hfp: well it's not as i imagine your .html links to the .css and .js files, and stuff..
[15:17:28] <shoky> hfp: anyway saying that again doesn't help ;p
[15:17:43] <hfp> shoky: Ok, one sec
[15:21:32] <hfp> shoky: html file: http://bpaste.net/show/hMav3WuS8We28boRI7vW/ , css file: http://bpaste.net/show/4ToCrzafj6eJQUeeQM9S/ , js file; http://bpaste.net/show/b9loF9VYnAVdUkeyDBw0/
[15:22:00] <hfp> shoky: It's not on any live webserver, it is a local file on my computer for now
[15:24:18] <shoky> hfp: works just fine for me locally
[15:26:06] <hfp> shoky: This is driving me nuts haha when I open it in my Chrome latest version and Firefox latest version, the image is not getting darker. If I don't use complicated functions etc but just a plain $('#selector').fadeTo("slow", 1, "swing"); it works. But when I am using these files, it doesn't... What gves?
[15:29:09] <hfp> I'll try and restart the beast
[15:29:20] <hfp> shoky: Thanks for taking a look
[15:29:27] <shoky> hfp: i dunno.. try debugging with a step debugger to make sure all the right spots in the code are running
[15:29:45] <shoky> and that the opacity according to debugger is as expected
[15:30:47] <hfp> shoky: I am outputting everything to the console and at least for the jQuery part the Opacity is calculated as it should. Pardon my ignorance but what is a step debugger for Chrome or Firefox? Would Firebug be that?
[15:31:33] <shoky> hfp: firebug has one yeah. i mean setting a breakpoint and then running the code line by line while inspecting the variables/elements
[15:31:56] <shoky> hfp: and chrome has one built-in in the devools (F12, sources tab)
[15:32:27] <shoky> hfp: donno if you really need the step debugger but at least look in the elements view to see if the opacity is changing there or not.. just to figure out what's going on
[15:33:01] <shoky> ?ftjq

[15:33:17] <shoky> hfp: lots of debugging info in that link ^
[15:36:00] <HowardwLo> Hello all, are there any pitfalls in using any of these options to specify elements? https://dpaste.de/7HN2
[15:39:30] <shoky> HowardwLo: the first can be slow in some cases.. the second is usually better as just "#spanid".. the third can be slow as it's the same as *[name="spanname"] which checks the name attribute of EVERY element in the dom
[15:39:42] <PenguinMan98> I have a question for jquery tabs
[15:39:48] <hfp> shoky: Thanks
[15:40:01] <PenguinMan98> Does the link href have to match exactly one element ID?
[15:40:22] <HowardwLo> shoky: so just stick with id's?
[15:40:32] <PenguinMan98> Well I wanna know if I can do this:
[15:40:33] <PenguinMan98> <a href="#lists #negative, #lists positive">
[15:40:54] <PenguinMan98> oops: <a href="#lists #negative, #lists #positive">
[15:40:57] <shoky> HowardwLo: can't give a general answer to that question. id's are not always what you want, no
[15:41:30] <shoky> PenguinMan98: i doubt you can do that
[15:41:35] <HowardwLo> shoky: if i'm trying to do on click functions?
[15:42:08] <shoky> HowardwLo: if you have 100 spans then using an id is probably not ideal. i can't answer you without knowing MUCH more about what you're doing
[15:42:22] <PenguinMan98> @shoky: I appreciate your opinion but I'd like a more solid answer please.
[15:42:23] <b-ot> PenguinMan98: likeamoresolidanswerplease.com - ☺ AVAILABLE
[15:42:41] <shoky> PenguinMan98: then try it and see?
[15:42:48] <PenguinMan98> I did.  It threw an error
[15:42:55] <shoky> there's your solid answer then
[15:43:00] <HowardwLo> shoky: is there some docs i can read to figure out whats best for me?
[15:43:24] <PenguinMan98> I see
[15:43:24] <shoky> HowardwLo: eh.. i donno
[15:43:54] <HowardwLo> shoky: does that mean this sort of thing is not important?
[15:43:56] <PenguinMan98> Is there a way to include two different divs in one tab?
[15:44:46] <shoky> HowardwLo: no, it's important. it just means that you have to think about a specific case when trying to find the best solution
[15:45:38] <shoky> PenguinMan98: put two divs inside the tab contents..
[15:45:50] <shoky> emphasis on "inside"
[15:46:11] <PenguinMan98> Yeah.  I figured as much.  I don wanna rearrange the page that much... *sob*
[15:46:19] <PenguinMan98> ok thanks!
[15:47:22] <HowardwLo> shoky: what would you suggest i do?
[15:47:42] <shoky> HowardwLo: i can't suggest anything without knowing what you're doing and what you want happening.... you've given no info at all
[15:48:15] <shoky> HowardwLo: but, it's not very important if you're not having any performance issues
[15:48:26] <shoky> don't fix it if it ain't broke (and you're not sure how to fix it)
[15:49:04] <HowardwLo> shoky: ok sounds good :). I was trying to track clicks using mix panel, and someone brought up how using a bunch of ID's might not be a good idea
[15:49:17] <shoky> HowardwLo but generally yes, using an id instead of "[name=something]" is generally better, if you need to select this specific element
[15:49:31] <HowardwLo> shoky: ok thanks
[16:57:12] <hfp> Could anyone advise how to console.log the id or class of a selector? 'this' selectors are driving me nuts and I would like to log to the console what 'this' refers to exactly in multiple places in my code...
[17:03:01] <tripflex> so i'm working on the design of a site for someone who wanted to be cheap and now i have to hack apart an already created software...I added bootstrap to it and i'm not sure if it's default from bootstrap, or some other code in the default app, but when you click on one of the bootstrap tabs it automatically scrolls the page down.  In my efforts to try and figure this out I realized I don't know any way to "track down" what is actually causing th
[17:03:01] <tripflex> under firebug or something I may be able to look at events and find it, but can't find anything there.
[17:03:28] <tripflex> So I guess my real question is, what's the best way to find out what is causing the page to scroll whenever a tab is clicked on
[17:10:50] <shoky> tripflex: my first guess would be that it's the href of the <a> causing it maybe..
[17:13:00] <tripflex> yeah but i mean for debugging purposes
[17:13:07] <tripflex> whats the best way to track down what is actually doing it
[17:13:32] <tripflex> im sure it has to be the a link but not sure how to determine what is tied to it
[17:13:46] <shoky> i mean, that it's being done automatically by the browser
[17:14:34] <shoky> because you have something like <a href="#sometab">  and maybe the event's default action (to scroll to the sometab element) is not being prevented
[17:23:39] <hfp> Alroght. I wasted my whole day on this and I still can't understand why this is not working on my computer but when I copy paste it in jsFiddle, it works fine. This is the jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/BzxB9/ . The image to the right is supposed to go darker when moused over and fade back to lighter when mouse leaves. The text "Decoder" is supposed to fadIn when the moue enters and fadeOut when the mouse leaves. All of this is working
[17:23:39] <hfp> beautifully in the jsFiddle. However, on my computer, it isn't. the image isn't becoming darker. These are the files that you can uncompress to your hard drive and open cv.html to see for yourself: https://anonfiles.com/file/8f65f8b7cc40efafa7e0e520935cec1b . I cannot fathom what the problem is, it is driving me mad. I tried in Firefox 25.0.1 and Chrome 31.0.1650.57 for Mac. Thanks!
[17:46:45] <BillCriswell> hfp: It just doesn't seem to work with 10.2
[17:46:51] <BillCriswell> If I use 10.1 locally it's cool.
[17:50:15] <pixelpimp> hfp: fortunately this isn't a problem, as you have no need for any javascript there
[17:50:27] <pixelpimp> what you want are some simple CSS rules
[17:57:13] <shoky> hfp: i think the jquery script you are using is modified
[17:57:23] <shoky> download a fresh copy
[17:58:15] <pixelpimp> or use a CDN hosted one
[17:58:29] <shoky> your jquery is modified with some stuff regarding: fadedOpacity    for example.. whereas jquery has no reference to this
[17:59:23] <BillCriswell> hfp: http://jsbin.com/AWEtuDu/2/edit?html,css,output if you can use CSS3
[18:06:18] <hfp> shoky: Aaaaaaah I think I know what happened!!! I am using the webstorm IDE and I refactored a variable. I think the IDE even looked in the jquery library and refactored it there... This would explain why it is modified because I downloaded the library straight from jquery's website
[18:21:08] <shoky> heh sounds probable
[18:23:41] <hfp> I'm gutted I wasted all day on this... Thanks for catching it!
[18:23:53] <shoky> np
[19:21:33] <grafi> lol
[19:22:25] <jedimind> thats not funny

[19:41:54] <hfp> BillCriswell: Nice one, but I understand CSS3 support is very limited?
[19:44:32] <shoky> hfp: css transitions are supported in every modern browser, and IE10+
[19:49:24] <hfp> shoky: Good to know
[20:50:10] <fictive> question: when doing an ajax post request, I return a 200 OK and some data to the success part of the ajax post function. The data sent back will not parse because of unicode characters unless I change it to some other http status code. why is this?
[20:54:43] <hfp> Why do all the libraries CDN have no protocl in the URL they give? For example, the jQuery CDN is "//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js" and Googles is "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js" ?
