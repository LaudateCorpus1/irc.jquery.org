[00:00:09] <crocket> man
[00:18:25] <mazzachre> I've been trying to do some really simple hover functionality using mouseenter and mouseleave handlers... In all but IE this works fine and everything is done as it is supposed to, but in IE the events are fired constantly when the mouse moves... So the UI flickers and becomes slow and unresponsive...
[00:21:10] <systemfault> mazzachre: And you're using jQuery to do it?!
[00:21:39] <systemfault> Because IIRC, mouseenter/mouseleave is a MS creation..
[00:21:46] <systemfault> It should be well supported.
[00:23:01] <_genuser_> interesting situation.
[00:23:19] <_genuser_> in one .dialog(),     .text() returns values of <input type="text" fields. In another only .val() works.
[00:24:30] <Cork> systemfault: wow it is?
[00:24:38] <Cork> i've only seen it in jquery
[00:25:19] <Cork> interesting...
[00:26:03] <Cork> that was a nice addition to dom3 for sure
[00:26:42] <systemfault> IE has supported it since.... 5.5
[00:26:52] <Cork> systemfault: ya i just saw that :)
[00:26:53] <_genuser_> this is frustrating. very much.
[00:27:02] <systemfault> Perhaps even before since quirksmode doesn't list IE4
[00:27:15] <_genuser_> $( "#AddProfileDIV #addprofileform #profilename" ).val();
[00:27:22] <Cork> _genuser_: .text() should never give you content of input fields
[00:27:31] <Cork> the default for textareas; sure
[00:27:35] <Cork> but not input fields
[00:27:39] <_genuser_> how is it that .val() works in one. But on the other it says undefined.
[00:27:49] <systemfault> _genuser_: That selector doesn't make sense.
[00:27:51] <_genuser_> the second dialog is a copy/paste of the first.
[00:27:53] <Cork> ya
[00:28:02] <Cork> did you intend to have commas there?
[00:28:18] <Cork> no
[00:28:18] <_genuser_> descendents
[00:28:19] <Cork> hmm
[00:28:31] <Cork> _genuser_: id's are unique
[00:28:37] <Cork> they can't ever exist in more then one place
[00:28:41] <_genuser_> inside AddProfileDIV addprofileform (<form> element)  #profilename (<input>)
[00:28:41] <Cork> in the page
[00:28:52] <Cork> $('#profilename" ).val();
[00:28:53] <_genuser_> hmmm, that's probably the best place to start.
[00:29:12] <Cork> your html is broken if that isn't the element your looking for
[00:29:20] <_genuser_> to make sure they are unique is why I was doing hierarchy wise
[00:29:31] <Cork> _genuser_: no point to make sure
[00:29:43] <Cork> if you by page design can't guarantee it use classes
[00:30:06] <Cork> cause you actually can't target more then one of them through the browsers id hash
[00:30:20] <_genuser_> Cork: hmmm, it was a cut/paste job. so very possible the html is borked.
[00:30:39] <Cork> ya, and it sounds like that is the cause of your problem
[00:30:42] <_genuser_> Cork: so what I'm guessing is that it's preferrable to just have a uniqueid and then do $('uniqueid').val();
[00:30:54] <Cork> _genuser_: not really
[00:31:05] <_genuser_> so the traversal scheme I have in place sounds fine then?
[00:31:19] <Cork> _genuser_: if the selector you want to match is an id there is no point with an hierarchy
[00:31:36] <Cork> cause you can't ever match anything other then the first element matching the id in the page anyway
[00:31:45] <_genuser_> that's true.
[00:31:52] <_genuser_> otherwise, there'd be no point in ids.
[00:31:56] <Cork> if you want hierarchy, use and id and inside it classes
[00:32:08] <Cork> then the inner points can be other places in the page
[00:32:35] <Cork> personally is use id's quite sparsely cause of this specific reason
[00:32:42] <Cork> i normally use classes instead
[00:33:02] <Cork> basically id if the element section can ever only exist once
[00:33:06] <Cork> and classes for everything else
[00:33:14] <Cork> (except for form elements)
[00:33:20] <_genuser_> well, they're form fields. So they'll have unique names within the form. I guess I could add unique ID's within the code. Then user Form ID and item id.
[00:33:28] * Cork nods
[00:33:36] <Cork> ya form fields should have unique ids
[00:33:53] <_genuser_> right, so them the over paranoid 3 layer traversal can go.
[00:33:55] <Cork> so yes add a number at the end or something like that
[00:34:12] <Cork> though for you own sanity don't use [] or dot in the id name :)
[00:34:46] <_genuser_> nah, that would make it harder ... much harder to figure out who what where when.
[00:37:10] <_genuser_> Cork: bingo btw. </form> was missing. b0rked html.
[00:37:20] <_genuser_> thanks for offering ideas and new suggestions. :)
[00:37:25] <Cork> np
[00:51:48] <bb1988> I want to only show a certain HTML element if a certain option is selected in an HTML select option drop down menu
[00:51:52] <bb1988> how can I do this?
[00:52:15] <Cork> bb1988: bind a change event on the select element
[00:52:29] <Cork> and when that fires ex. add a class to the other element
[00:52:34] <bb1988> Cork, can you assist me with this? maybe send me some example code
[00:53:32] <Cork> $('select').on('change', function() { $('#target').toggleClass('hide', $(this).val() !== 'option'); });
[00:55:53] <bb1988> jsfiddle that Cork
[01:02:37] <bb1988> Cork,
[01:05:52] <mordof> has anyone ever seen scenarios where an ajax request takes up to 5 seconds to respond (that's ok in this scenario), and the ajax deferred actually fails to resolve as a result?
[01:05:56] <mordof> but no console errors are thrown
[01:06:33] <Cork> mordof: do you get the fail callback?
[01:07:50] <mordof> Cork: one sec
[01:08:14] <mordof> oh i do.. hmmm
[01:08:40] <Cork> mordof: check the status message
[01:08:47] <Cork> i suspect a parsing error
[01:08:54] <Cork> or a simple connection timeout
[01:09:09] <mordof> ah, yeah it's failing to parse it.. strange
[01:09:47] <Cork> mordof: and this is why you should always have a fail callback :D
[01:10:09] <mordof> Cork: mhmm. I'll keep one in and just do a console.error with it from now on
[01:10:18] <Cork> ya
[01:10:21] <mordof> this is strange ....
[01:11:06] <mordof> Cork: would parseJSON fail if there was a space between the first { and the key? do you kinow
[01:11:14] <Cork> no
[01:11:24] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[01:11:26] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. → http://jsonlint.com/
[01:11:54] <mordof> oh. key names can't be without strings
[01:11:59] <mordof> thanks, that's helpful :)
[01:12:11] <Cork> mordof: you should use the language built in tools to generate json
[01:12:23] <mordof> pretty sure i did
[01:12:30] <Cork> what language?
[01:12:38] <mordof> oh, nevermind
[01:12:42] <mordof> i've done so with every other one, heh
[01:12:44] <mordof> woops
[01:12:53] <mordof> oh i know why i didn't
[01:12:59] <mordof> i was concatenating multiple json responses
[01:13:01] <Cork> anyway keys that arn't strings is only valid in javascript objects
[01:13:03] <Cork> not in json
[01:13:05] <mordof> and my very first key was the only one i made
[01:14:22] <mordof> there, that works.
[01:14:33] <mordof> now to remove the multitudes of logs around the file xD
[01:16:45] <iaj> Hi there :)
[01:17:15] <iaj> Is jQuery 2.0 downwards compatible to 1.9 ?
[01:17:21] <Cork> yes
[01:17:31] <iaj> So it's the most recommendable version?
[01:17:37] <Cork> 2.0 has removed old ie support
[01:17:53] <Cork> and 2.0 is cause of that smaller and in some cases a bit faster
[01:18:10] <Cork> so use 1.10 if you need old ie support else go with 2.0
[01:18:20] <Cork> or is it 2.1 now
[01:18:39] <Cork> opps
[01:18:42] <Cork> 1.11 and 2.1
[01:20:13] <iaj> ahw.
[01:20:13] <iaj> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[01:20:18] <iaj> Seems like I need the msie :)
[01:20:29] <Cork> not really
[01:20:43] <Cork> write your code to feature detect instead of browser version detect
[01:20:57] <iaj> Yeah well that's a certain plugin I use
[01:21:11] <Cork> ?g jquery-migration
[01:21:13] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Core 1.9 Upgrade Guide | jQuery → http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/
[01:21:17] <Cork> ?g jquery-migrate
[01:21:19] <b-ot> Cork: jquery/jquery-migrate · GitHub → https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/
[01:21:21] <Cork> ^
[01:21:36] <Cork> it reimplements the old removed parts of jquery 1.8
[01:22:29] <iaj> Ah so I just add the migrate script to my page?
[01:28:05] <iaj> Cork: I added the migrate thing but I still get the   Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined
[01:28:35] <Cork> iaj: did you add the lib after jquery?
[01:28:47] <iaj> yeah
[01:28:54] <iaj> Actually this is a TYPO3 page.
[01:29:08] <Cork> migrate should work
[01:29:18] <iaj> You could check it out here: http://www.verkaufshypnose.eu/abendseminar_nls
[01:29:48] <iaj> Maybe I should'nt use t3jquery :D
[01:30:25] <iaj> Only 2.0.3 available to generate tho :
[01:30:26] <iaj> :/
[01:30:27] <bigbugjava>  <li><a class="modalbox" href="#FB_Loader" onclick="aFriendlistTest();"><i class="icon-envelope pull-right"></i>Send Invite</a></li>   // The code and modalbox works, but the onclick doesn't get excuted, anyreason why?
[01:31:00] <Cork> iaj: http://jsfiddle.net/AwS98/
[01:31:36] <Cork> bigbugjava: you shouldn't use onclick event attributes
[01:31:40] <Cork> use event handlers instead
[01:32:05] <bigbugjava> Cork can you point me
[01:32:10] <Cork> ?api on
[01:32:10] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:32:41] <iaj> Cork: hmmm.. Seems like t3jquery is actually able to include migrate... DOing so now.
[01:33:24] <systemfault> Damn... stupid backend frameworks should stop messing with frontend-related stuff.
[01:34:49] <Cork> ya
[01:34:59] <iaj> Cork: your fiddle is not working tho :/
[01:35:01] <Cork> i remember drupal was really horrible at that
[01:35:10] <Cork> iaj: worked fine here
[01:35:13] <Cork> did you check the console?
[01:35:50] <bigbugjava> Cork  $('FB_Loader').on('click',function() ?
[01:36:16] <Cork> #FB* but other then that; ya
[01:36:33] <Cork> $() takes css selectors
[01:37:12] <bigbugjava> my man :) thx, first issue solved
[01:37:34] <iaj> Cork: I just get those errors now :JQMIGRATE: Logging is active jquery-2.0.x-1.10.x-1.2.x.js?1393493443:8899
[01:37:37] <iaj> JQMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated
[01:37:49] <Cork> iaj: check after that
[01:38:17] <Cork> you should have "<value> <value> <value>"
[01:38:27] <Cork> * "<value> <value> <value> <value>"
[01:38:38] <iaj> hu?
[01:38:39] <Cork> value = true/undefined
[01:39:27] <Cork> "undefined undefined true" for example
[01:39:51] <Cork> the combo you get depends on the browser
[01:40:09] <Cork> but yes those other warnings is expected, as this is a migration lib
[01:40:16] <Cork> (you can turn the logging off though)
[01:41:04] <iaj> Ok I see..
[01:41:06] <Cork> jQuery.migrateMute = true; will silence those loggings
[01:41:08] <iaj> Yeah I shall turn logging off
[01:41:31] <Cork> though you should see if you can find an updated version of the plugin
[01:41:41] <Cork> that is compatible with jquery 1.9+
[01:42:24] <iaj> Im running jquery 2.x now
[01:42:26] <iaj> 2.0.4
[01:42:56] <Cork> well ya, and you can use the old lib as long as they keep updating jquery-migrate to reimplement removed features
[01:43:10] <Cork> but you should try to find plugins that is up to date
[01:43:21] <systemfault> iaj: You don't care about IE8?
[01:44:46] <systemfault> (jQuery 2.x doesn't work on IE8)
[01:47:49] <iaj> Cork: When do I specify the jQuery.migrateMute = true part? before loading the migration lib?
[01:47:54] <iaj> systemfault: oh :/ hm
[01:48:07] <Cork> iaj: after loading jquery.js
[01:48:18] <systemfault> iaj: If you care then you want jQuery 1.11.0
[01:48:24] <Cork> anywhere after that, but before anything calls to removed features should work fine
[01:48:51] <Cork> iaj: what did you think i meant with old ie?
[01:48:56] <Cork> ie 4?
[01:48:58] <iaj> yeah :D"
[01:49:01] <iaj> something like that haha
[01:49:02] <Cork> heh
[01:49:18] <Cork> old ie means none standards complient ies
[01:49:35] <Cork> so that means ~ie9 :)
[01:49:42] <Cork> but jquery takes it as ie8
[01:50:50] <Cork> uh...
[01:50:53] <Cork> WTF
[01:51:07] <Cork> ie11 has disabled attributes on anchor links...
[01:51:15] <Cork> *properties
[01:52:32] <systemfault> O_O
[01:52:44] <shoky> wat?
[01:53:18] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hF3W6/
[01:53:29] <Cork> undefined in normal browsers
[01:53:33] <Cork> false in ie11 >_>
[01:53:42] <iaj> Got rid of the t3jquery now.. and using jquery-1.11.0.min + jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min
[01:53:47] <iaj> Seems to work like a charm now
[01:54:00] <iaj> Thanks for the help :)
[01:54:47] <fosser_josh> http://jsfiddle.net/rq99e/1/ how to iterate this array?
[01:54:59] * Cork adds an tagName check for ie...
[01:55:04] <shoky> oh, i read your sentence completely wrong Cork
[01:55:19] <bigbugjava> Cork I have done that trigger  $('#FB_Loader').on('click',function() {}.... I want it to work onload and $('#FB_Loader').on('load',function() {} doesn't do the trick
[01:55:44] <fosser_josh> i tried each and its just reading 3rd element from array
[01:55:48] <Cork> bigbugjava: what is #FB_Loader ?
[01:55:56] <Cork> bigbugjava: onload only fires on a few specific elements
[01:56:20] <bigbugjava> Cork it's a div id, of modalbox.
[01:56:26] <Cork> bigbugjava: there you go
[01:56:35] <Cork> bigbugjava: you don't have load events on divs
[01:56:49] <bigbugjava> umm section?
[01:56:54] <Cork> let se script, iframe, img, object, embed
[01:57:01] <Cork> am i missing any of the elements...
[01:57:09] <Cork> oh
[01:57:12] <Cork> audio and video
[01:57:21] <Cork> basically all elements that takes a src attribute
[01:57:41] <bigbugjava> sorry mate, but I dont understand how I can make it run
[01:57:53] <Cork> bigbugjava: you can't in the way your trying to do it
[01:58:07] <Cork> you need to use a callback from the function loading things into the div
[01:58:13] <Cork> or check for an iframe
[01:58:15] <Cork> for example
[01:58:49] <bigbugjava> umm iframe, was trying to avoid that all the time
[01:59:12] <Cork> ya me too
[01:59:24] <Cork> but that leaves the first option i gave
[01:59:33] <Cork> you need callback from the function adding the content to the div
[01:59:34] <bigbugjava> lets say I use iframe, src should be like herf?
[01:59:47] <Cork> href ya
[02:00:03] <pragma-> herf derf
[02:00:03] <bigbugjava> lets give it a go,thx
[02:00:10] <Cork> bigbugjava: but note i don't recommend using iframes
[02:00:11] <bigbugjava> lol
[02:00:24] <bigbugjava> then your recommendation is?
[02:00:29] <Cork> i just mean that is the restriction if you want to use onload
[02:00:37] <Cork> you need callback from the function adding the content to the div <-- third time now
[02:00:40] <bigbugjava> I want to aboid it
[02:00:46] <bigbugjava> lol
[02:02:10] <bigbugjava> Cork, have a look please http://jsfiddle.net/67y89/
[02:02:45] <bigbugjava> leave the function ofcourse, the idea, I dont know how to turn it into a callback
[02:03:43] <Cork> bigbugjava: well the callback needs to happen from $.getJSON or the function you pass to it
[02:04:11] <Cork> bigbugjava: you could just define a function in the same scope and have like 55 call it
[02:04:24] <Cork> anything else would prob be a bit hard
[02:04:41] <bigbugjava> 55 call it?
[02:04:47] <Cork> *line
[02:05:42] <bigbugjava> urg, probably me, but cant figure this one out.
[02:05:45] <mazzachre> Uh, was distracted by other work stuff... Yes, the endless calls to mouseenter/mouseleve when mouse moves problem I have, I have implemented with jQuery...
[02:05:56] <DelicateFlower> i want to use getJSON and use the data to verify user input. should i use async or sync?
[02:06:38] <systemfault> DelicateFlower: sync is never the answer with jS
[02:06:41] <Cork> bigbugjava: http://jsfiddle.net/67y89/1/
[02:07:34] <Cork> fosser_josh: () isn't valid the way you use it
[02:07:53] <Cork> did you mean to use [[],[]] ?
[02:08:38] <Cork> DelicateFlower: ya sync will frees the webpage until the answer gets back from the server (or the connection times out)
[02:08:44] <Cork> and that includes animations and what not
[02:08:51] <Cork> so you NEVER want to use sync
[02:08:52] <fosser_josh> Cork: actually that array coming from python object
[02:09:14] <Cork> fosser_josh: then you need to get python to generate a valid js array
[02:09:22] <Cork> you would have to parse it as a string to use it in js
[02:09:34] <bigbugjava> Cork I see it, what does it change?
[02:09:35] <fosser_josh> i need to change the way json is created
[02:09:40] <DelicateFlower> how should i structure my js so that it would deal with not getting the json data then??
[02:09:48] <Cork> fosser_josh: that isn't json
[02:09:51] <bigbugjava> it tells me if content is done loading..
[02:09:59] <Cork> fosser_josh: it is just a list of characters to json
[02:10:06] <Cork> and is totally invalid json
[02:10:32] <fosser_josh> yeah i need to change python code for that
[02:10:33] <Cork> bigbugjava: i added the function at the top and the call to it at line ~59
[02:10:52] <Cork> fosser_josh: ya
[02:11:03] <Cork> my point was just that isn't json
[02:11:15] <Cork> so you can't change how you generate json; you can generate json instead :)
[02:11:26] <bigbugjava> Cork notice it
[02:12:14] <tocka> Hi guys, is it possible to do a web scrapper with jquery? Uhm.. Or should I use another library? Thing is I have to deal with dynamic content that changes when a button is clicked..
[02:13:22] <systemfault> tocka: It's impossible in a browser.
[02:13:26] <Cork> tocka: you can't really scrap with js
[02:13:32] <Cork> systemfault: not really true
[02:13:38] <Cork> trusted js can do it
[02:13:47] <systemfault> Ok.. whatever.
[02:13:54] <Cork> (user script, greasemonkey, chrome js and so on)
[02:14:09] <Cork> but ya content script can't access content from other domains
[02:14:13] <pragma-> greasemonkey makes the internet more bearable.
[02:14:19] <chandramohan> hi @whirl3d there?
[02:14:24] <tocka> Cork I was looking at phantomJS
[02:14:28] <chandramohan> ive something for u
[02:14:33] <tocka> it looks like it can do it?
[02:14:44] <chandramohan> or @jphase there?
[02:14:50] <pragma-> chandramohan: this isn't twitter.
[02:14:51] <tocka> I mean I could use it to scrap..
[02:14:56] <Cork> tocka: if you can do it in a browser content script, without help from a server; you've found a security hole in the browser
[02:15:09] <Cork> tocka: no lib is suppose to be able to work around it
[02:15:09] <tocka> Hm..
[02:15:22] <chandramohan> yes..i know..but they helped couple hours before..that y im asking them
[02:15:23] <tocka> So what would you suggest?
[02:15:29] <chandramohan> http://jsfiddle.net/chandramohan/jK4La/13/
[02:15:32] <DelicateFlower> If I want to use getJSON to verify user input, how do i make sure that the data is already fetched before the user submits??
[02:15:33] <Cork> tocka: you need to use server code
[02:15:48] <tocka> could you clarify server code?
[02:16:03] <Cork> code that runs on the server serving the page?
[02:16:11] <tocka> oh haha
[02:16:19] <chandramohan> i want to capture button click events..('propagate','cancel') button in Jquery UI dialog
[02:16:44] <chandramohan> but i can capture outside elements not that dynamically created UI dialog buttons..
[02:16:51] <chandramohan> anyone please suggest me..
[02:17:20] <Cork> chandramohan: you would stop the submit event
[02:17:23] <Cork> fire the ajax call
[02:17:32] <Cork> and if the callback succeeds fire a new submit action
[02:17:37] <DelicateFlower> help me irc
[02:18:03] <chandramohan> http://jsfiddle.net/chandramohan/jK4La/13/
[02:18:03] <chandramohan> i didnt stop anything.

[02:18:30] <Cork> meaning something like $('form').on('submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); var self = this; $.post().done(function() { self.submit(); }) })
[02:27:57] <^^cjf^^> hello there, I have a form with different checkboxes I would like to compare this way: IF ((checkbox1.checked) && (checkbox2.checked) && (checkbox3.checked)){...}
[02:28:28] <^^cjf^^> I've been trying to find out the way of use AND, OR logical operators, but I am no longer able
[02:28:38] <Snoopal> i got radio buttons. when sombody clicks on submit i read all values and save it to an arry. so my problem is when i use val = jQuery('#smh-form input[name="' + target + '_value"]').val(); i get the value of the first radio item. if i use jQuery('#smh-form input[name="' + target + '_value"]').is(':checked').val() i get the error that this object has not function val
[02:28:44] <Snoopal> any ideas how i get the correct selected value?
[02:28:58] <^^cjf^^> anyone could help me with this? thanks
[02:29:57] <Snoopal> ^^cjf^^: if(checkbox.is(':checked') && checkbox2.is(':checked') etc
[02:30:01] <xKraty> ^^cjf^^: if ( $('.checkbox').is(':checked') && $('.checkbox2').is(':checked')
[02:30:50] <^^cjf^^> I've tried in a similar way, with: ".attr('checked')){ "
[02:30:59] <fosser_josh> Cork: [ob1:['el1', 'el2', 'el3'], obj2:['el1', 'el2']]
[02:31:03] <^^cjf^^> going to try the way you told me
[02:31:06] <fosser_josh> is this right json?
[02:31:08] <^^cjf^^> thanks in advance :)
[02:32:56] <xKraty> Snoopal: try jQuery('#smh-form input[name="' + target + '_value"]:checked').val()
[02:33:17] <fosser_josh> Cork: or do i need to create this kind of object  {ob1:['el1', 'el2', 'el3'], obj2:['el1', 'el2']}
[02:33:37] <BinaryKitten> ^^cjf^^ var checkboxes = $('.checkbox'); if (checkboxes.filter(':checked').length = checboxes.length) { // all checked }
[02:33:54] <xKraty> Snoopal: not sure you can chain the .val to .is
[02:34:32] <BinaryKitten> xKraty you sure can't
[02:34:37] <BinaryKitten> .is returns boolean value
[02:34:55] <Snoopal> xKraty: that works! :)
[02:34:56] <Snoopal> thank you! :)
[02:36:18] <xKraty> BinaryKitten: i thought so!
[02:36:25] <Cork> fosser_josh: http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html
[02:36:26] <xKraty> Snoopal: np
[02:37:10] <^^cjf^^> thanks you very much Snoopal, xKraty, BinaryKitten
[02:37:16] <^^cjf^^> your tips made the trick :)
[02:37:19] <^^cjf^^> much appreciated
[02:37:28] <xKraty> :)
[02:43:27] <Macaveli> What's the alternative for dataset in IE8?
[02:44:06] <BinaryKitten> Macaveli use .attr('data-' + yourkey)
[02:44:19] <xKraty> Macaveli: uninstall IE8?
[02:44:20] <BinaryKitten> rather than element.dataset[yourkey]
[02:45:35] <Macaveli> so
[02:45:49] <Macaveli> this.attr
[02:46:00] <Cork> $(this).attr
[02:46:11] <Cork> attr is a jquery function
[02:46:39] <Cork> you could use this.getAttribute('data-' + yourkey) if you want to go native
[02:50:57] <Macaveli> Cork, BinaryKitten thanks!
[02:51:00] <Macaveli>   	console.log(this.getAttribute('data-index')); did the trick
[02:51:02] <Macaveli> damn you IE8
[02:51:49] <Cork> Macaveli: well ie8 never claimed to support the new html features
[02:52:03] <BinaryKitten> not really IE8's fault a new featuer was introduced after it was released
[02:52:13] <BinaryKitten> ^5 Corey
[02:52:17] <BinaryKitten> Cork even
[02:52:24] <Macaveli> I will correct
[02:52:27] <Cork> BinaryKitten: it was actually released before
[02:52:33] <Macaveli> damn you customers still running IE8
[02:52:33] <Macaveli> :p
[02:52:40] <Cork> but ie8 was when ms was still trying to catch up at that time
[02:52:54] <BinaryKitten> IE8 was released before ... or the data-xxx was already released?
[02:53:07] <Cork> already released
[02:53:23] <Cork> well depends on if you accepts the specs from whatwg
[02:53:45] <Cork> or if you only accept w3cs freeses of the whatwg specs
[03:11:08] <iceptic1> hey
[03:11:36] <xKraty> hello
[03:13:04] <iceptic1> xkraty do you know how to do hover and bind event with a ajax query to a php script?
[03:14:11] <xKraty> iceptic1: $('.selector').on('mouseover', function() { $.ajax({..}); });
[03:14:39] <ska-fan> How do I get this element in jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/8TBdV/
[03:15:12] <Cork> ska-fan: what element?
[03:15:25] <ska-fan> Cork: It's hard do put in words, it's in the fiddle :)
[03:15:37] <Cork> isn't really
[03:15:42] <ska-fan> Basically I want the tab header for a certain tab in a bootstrap tab nav
[03:16:12] <Cork> so again what element are you looking for
[03:16:17] <ska-fan> the correct li
[03:16:22] <BinaryKitten> marquee!!!! ---
[03:16:27] * BinaryKitten runs for the 90s
[03:16:32] <Cork> there is no element with anything to identify "correct" on them
[03:16:45] * xKraty punch the jukebox
[03:16:58] <BinaryKitten> noooo don't do that xKraty
[03:17:15] <iceptic1> xkraty could you do me a mock up in jsfiddle?
[03:17:28] * BinaryKitten hides as the jukebox starts belting out "Never gonna give you up....
[03:17:41] <ska-fan> Cork: Ok, I have the tab-pane's id, say 'messages' Now I want the li from '.nav > li a[href="#messages"]'
[03:17:47] <Cork> iceptic1: calling ajax calls on element hover is most likely going to hammer your server
[03:17:54] <Cork> iceptic1: are you sure about that idea?
[03:18:13] <iceptic1> im not sure if there is any other way to do it
[03:18:15] * BinaryKitten wiggles mouse over the element
[03:18:30] <BinaryKitten> ajax, ajax, wiggle, wiggle, ajax, wiggle, ajax
[03:18:34] <iceptic1> what im wanting to do is pull information about a users profile when hovering over there username
[03:18:44] <Cork> ska-fan: ok, why do you need the i for that?
[03:18:48] <BinaryKitten> ?hoverintent @ iceptic1
[03:18:57] <BinaryKitten> no? bot no likey
[03:19:12] <ska-fan> Cork: the problem being that I don't want to assume anything about how deep inside the .nav' the a element is.
[03:19:12] <BinaryKitten> http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html @ iceptic1
[03:19:32] <Cork> ska-fan: ok?
[03:19:41] <ska-fan> Cork: The i and marquee and span is there just to illustrate that
[03:19:41] <BinaryKitten> ska-fan .. grab the link.. then use trascend upwards
[03:19:50] <Cork> $('.nav li a[href="#messages"]') then
[03:19:56] <BinaryKitten> rather than assuming the start position
[03:20:03] <ska-fan> Cork: that gives me the a, i need the li
[03:20:07] <Cork> ah
[03:20:17] <Cork> ('a[href="#messages"]').closest('li')
[03:20:20] <Cork> * $('a[href="#messages"]').closest('li')
[03:20:23] <iceptic1> binery kitten that looks good thanks, just having a proper look at it now
[03:20:28] <BinaryKitten> $('a[href=#messages]).closest('li')
[03:20:34] <BinaryKitten> heh
[03:20:42] <Cork> BinaryKitten: quite your attr values
[03:20:44] <Cork> :)
[03:20:45] <ska-fan> Cork: Ok, other words: I need that one child of .nav that contains the a with that href
[03:20:55] <BinaryKitten> i got told not too before Corey
[03:20:55] <xKraty> iceptic1: there we go
[03:20:57] <BinaryKitten> *cork
[03:20:57] <ska-fan> I don't know what element type that is
[03:21:02] <xKraty> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f27978cd87b6296b9eb8
[03:21:04] <Cork> BinaryKitten: huh?
[03:21:11] <Cork> BinaryKitten: why not, you get bugs if you don't
[03:21:13] <oxsav> Anyone have a good url/tutorial to know how to develop jquery plugins?
[03:21:18] <Cork> and there is no problem with doing it
[03:21:33] <BinaryKitten> Cork no there isn't
[03:21:38] <ska-fan> oxsav: the learn.jquery has something
[03:21:41] <BinaryKitten> just rembember being told not to before
[03:21:50] <ska-fan> learn.jquery.com
[03:22:09] <shoky> oxsav i like this one for the basics  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[03:22:22] <Cork> BinaryKitten: $('input[name="field[]"]') try doing that without the quites
[03:22:25] <oxsav> tks _o_
[03:22:31] <Cork> *quotes
[03:22:50] <Cork> BinaryKitten: so ya, the info you got is wrong
[03:22:57] <BinaryKitten> Cork yes i agree
[03:23:11] <BinaryKitten> just when you get shouted down so many times, you start to wonder
[03:23:19] <Cork> :)
[03:23:32] <Cork> BinaryKitten: just gather examples on why you do it a specific way
[03:23:41] <Cork> and just shoot them with it when they attack you!
[03:24:08] <Cork> it usually helps a lot is quieting those
[03:24:21] <Cork> *lot in
[03:24:28] <computer2000> anyone knows how to .add elements into the beginning of the array instead of appending to the end?
[03:24:40] <Cork> ?mdn unshift
[03:24:42] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.unshift() - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift
[03:25:58] <ska-fan> Ok, in other words. I have an element A and i need the closest parent that is a child of a .nav. How do I do that?
[03:26:19] <Cork> $('a[href="#messages"]').closest('.nav > li')
[03:26:58] <Cork> ska-fan: THAT was the question you should have asked from the start
[03:27:09] <ska-fan> Cork: Of course!. That's it. thanks :)
[03:27:43] <ska-fan> Sometimes the hard part is figuring out how to put the question correctly :)
[03:27:52] <Cork> ya
[03:27:59] <computer2000> Cork: can i use unshift with $.add() ?
[03:28:24] <iceptic1> binerykitten ive tryed a demo, but im think im going wrong somewhere http://jsfiddle.net/2LsPX/ what am i doing wrong?
[03:29:08] <Cork> computer2000: haven't tried but technically you should be able to do var list = $(); list.unshift($('<html>')[0]))
[03:29:25] <computer2000> Cork: ok thx
[03:29:29] <iceptic1> ah wait i know what i done wrong
[03:29:56] <iceptic1> i forgot to load jquery lol, how would i then convert this into a ajax request to the php script?
[03:39:50] <cprodigy29> Can anyone explain to me why this isn't working?
[03:39:51] <cprodigy29> http://pastie.org/8804806
[03:39:56] <cprodigy29> http://pastie.org/8804815
[03:40:20] <cprodigy29> I want to put the JS for handlebar.js in the index.js file
[03:40:27] <xKraty> cprodigy29: because is a text file? :D
[03:40:43] <Cork> please use a running site instead of pb's
[03:40:56] <cprodigy29> if I add it to sample.html in-between script tags it works fine
[03:40:56] <Cork> jsbin.com is prob the simplest option for you
[03:42:02] <cprodigy29> Cork: it's a phone gap application
[03:42:20] <xKraty> anyway the handlebars needs to be compiled
[03:42:27] <cprodigy29> Cork: using jquery mobile and I'm trying to implement handlebar.js
[03:42:36] <cprodigy29> xKraty: are the not now?
[03:43:17] <cprodigy29> xKraty: in that single function it compiles
[03:43:30] <xKraty> cprodigy29: we can't see your js
[03:43:38] <cprodigy29> xKraty: that's index.js
[03:43:42] <cprodigy29> xKraty: http://pastie.org/8804815
[03:45:12] <xKraty> yeah templating looks fine
[03:45:19] <xKraty> but meh i dunno how it works phonegap
[03:47:02] <cprodigy29> xKraty: yea its weird if i take that out of the JS file and throw it in script tags on the html file it works fine
[03:47:34] <xKraty> cprodigy29: maybe phonegap events are rendered in another way/timing no idea
[03:51:22] <computer2000> how can i make an .each() through elements but in random order?
[03:51:48] <computer2000> like not going through el1, 2, 3,.. but 2, 3, 1,...
[03:52:17] <cprodigy29> xKraty: it has something to do with the page element from jquery mobile
[03:52:37] <slax0r> computer2000: http://staydecent.ca/bits/jquery-random-each
[03:52:40] <slax0r> here's an attempt
[03:52:46] <cprodigy29> xKraty: because if i add app.single(); within the page div it works
[03:53:01] <xKraty> cprodigy29: meh, could be anything i don't know how that environment works
[03:53:08] <cprodigy29> xKraty: lol
[03:53:14] <xKraty> you should check if there is a #phonegap
[03:54:03] <krambiorix> I'm trying to get the first div in a div that doesn't have a title class ... What am i doing wrong ? $(this).find('div:not(.title)').first()
[03:55:09] <xKraty> krambiorix: try $(this).find('div').not('.title').first()
[04:00:24] <krambiorix> xKraty, thanks but then i get the first div in the div that doesn't have a title class...  I want the first div in $(this) that doesn't have a title class
[04:04:01] <xKraty> krambiorix: try $(this).find('div:first').not('.title') ?
[04:09:33] <krambiorix> xKraty, solved, thanks!
[04:09:47] <xKraty> ^^
[04:20:42] <PatBateman> hi anyone using DataTables ?
[04:21:21] <PatBateman> using with large number of data DT renders a little bit slow, any advice how to speed it up?
[04:24:12] <Cork> PatBateman: how many elements do you have in the page when it gets slow?
[04:24:29] <Cork> the dom becomes slow if you get a high number of dom elements
[04:36:06] <glontu> hi
[04:36:43] <glontu> i have this array of object and another ( partial ) object that has only some of the properties of the objects contained in the array
[04:37:08] <glontu> how can i find an object in the array of objects that includes all the properties of the partial objects and has the same values ?
[04:37:31] <Cork> glontu: that is actually quite hard in js
[04:37:49] <Cork> you would have to loop the array and then check each value in each object and if all the values match
[04:37:55] <Cork> you have a matching object
[04:38:30] <glontu> Cork, just killed my moralle with that "quite hard in js" statement :)
[04:38:44] <PatBateman> Cork: i found a server side solution, trying that
[04:39:05] <Cork> glontu: i've always been annoyed with the fact that you can't compare objects in js
[04:39:21] <Cork> ({} == {}) == always false
[04:39:50] <glontu> that makes me a sad panda :(
[04:40:33] <Cork> glontu: only time you can compare "objects" is if you variables point to the exact same object
[04:40:44] <Cork> var a = {}; b = a; b == a
[04:41:21] <glontu> ok, thanks
[04:41:43] <Cork> but then you actually compare the object reference id and not the object
[04:42:10] <Cork> kinda like checking the memory pointer in c instead of the content at the memory position
[04:56:10] <diegoviola> hi
[04:56:34] <diegoviola> what do i need to modify in this code so that i can trigger that ajax call when the user presses enter as well: https://gist.github.com/9249508
[04:56:55] <diegoviola> right now it uses blur() and that works but i want to trigger the ajax call by pressing enter also
[04:57:31] <diegoviola> i don't need new lines
[05:03:32] <decx> well in a form you'd have submit, but with a separate contenteditable you might need to track keydown -> keyCode 13 for enter
[05:03:54] <diegoviola> i see
[05:06:23] <CalR> is the place to ask for jQuery help?
[05:06:30] <sarodj> hey guys, could someone help me out with a problem. im trying to fix the resize in: file:///home/user/Desktop/logo-nav/index.html
[05:06:35] <diegoviola> thanks
[05:06:38] <sarodj> excuse me, http://n0psled.nl/monitorix/
[05:07:26] <sarodj> i would like to resize it beyond max-width and max-height. Also the resizing is ugly because the height > actual content
[05:07:27] <Luke-T> hey i'm a pretty big jquery noob and im having some trouble getting jquery to run on a test page i made
[05:13:06] <bigOmega> what problem are you facing Luke-T
[05:14:04] <decx> what's stopping you from just changing the css sarodj ?
[05:14:32] <decx> you can overwrite bootstraps defaults
[05:15:03] <sarodj> decx: i have set width to 90% so it looks ok on mobile devices. i have set max-width to 800px so it will not fill my screen
[05:15:18] <sarodj> and max-height to i believe 270px
[05:15:26] <sarodj> but when i resize the img
[05:15:40] <sarodj> i can still resize to max height with the border so it looks ugly
[05:15:49] <sarodj> how do i keep a ratio in jquery
[05:16:48] <decx> the img has an inline style width/height 100%
[05:17:22] <sarodj> yes
[05:17:30] <sarodj> so it will resize with the dix
[05:17:32] <sarodj> div
[05:17:44] <decx> well change it to max-width/max-height then
[05:19:22] <decx> trying to make a table look right on mobile will always be a fight against windmills
[05:20:12] <sarodj> hehheh
[05:20:54] <decx> i'm actually breaking up my tables into blocks for my 'responsive' stuff
[05:21:22] <decx> when the site absolutely has to have tables, like a cart overview
[05:21:41] <decx> but you dont even need a table to present that information you have
[05:21:42] <slax0r> is there a reason why I can't set css styles in a .each() using $(this)?
[05:21:45] <slax0r> I can get the text
[05:21:47] <slax0r> set the text
[05:21:51] <slax0r> but can't set css -.-
[05:22:03] <decx> works fine slax0r
[05:22:32] <slax0r> http://pastebin.com/jcp7PL0s
[05:22:33] <slax0r> it does not
[05:23:34] <xKraty> ankurk____: you there?
[05:23:44] <decx> your color is a string
[05:23:52] <ankurk____> Hey xKraty! :D
[05:23:58] <ankurk____> what's up?
[05:24:08] <ankurk____> Just reached office few minutes back.
[05:24:11] <xKraty> nm break almost over
[05:24:17] <ankurk____> lol
[05:24:23] <ankurk____> no worries :)
[05:24:25] <xKraty> oh yeah you are at last 7 hours behind :D
[05:24:34] <ankurk____> yeah :P we are
[05:24:38] <xKraty> was wondering how was going your table lol
[05:25:16] <ankurk____> well, table's fine but still has some bugs. My boss now wants to apply multiple filters at the same time.
[05:25:26] <xKraty> ahahah told ya!
[05:25:40] <ankurk____> I do have filters using select boxes
[05:25:52] <ankurk____> but can't apply them together
[05:25:52] <xKraty> as i showed you
[05:26:08] <ankurk____> yeah, gotta work on that
[05:27:00] <slax0r> decx: yes it's a string, can it not be?
[05:27:01] <xKraty> i still wonder why your boss made you works about 2 week on a table that could have be done in an hour or so
[05:27:19] <decx> slax0r your error must be somewhere else http://jsfiddle.net/decx/jjj7A/
[05:27:55] <ankurk____> xKraty: I attribute it to my slow pace and the fact that the module table is in uses YUI.
[05:28:23] <xKraty> lol
[05:28:37] <xKraty> btw you should rename or in few days you ll become ankurk_________________________________
[05:29:17] <ankurk____> IRCCloud renames my username very often
[05:29:45] <decx> i should register ankurk just to be a cunt :>
[05:29:50] <xKraty> still that irc cloud subscription :D
[05:30:03] <xKraty> decx: that's would be very nice
[05:30:37] <ankurk____> I had ankurk as username but I forgot the password :P
[05:30:57] <xKraty> try 123456
[05:31:08] <ph88> does someone know a good library to make modal windows that support IE8 and up ?
[05:31:24] <ankurk> hello someone can help me with tables?
[05:31:50] <ankurk____> WTH
[05:31:54] <ankurk> lol
[05:32:02] <ankurk____> damn

[05:33:29] <slax0r> decx: yeah, probably...tnx anyway
[05:33:48] <bigOmega> ph88 i think bootstrap supports ie8
[05:33:57] <slax0r> but weirdest is, if I write out the color hex instead of obtaining it from the text, it works, but all have the same color
[05:34:08] <slax0r> and when I print out the color strings, it works as well
[05:34:14] <slax0r> I mean, print to console
[05:34:17] <ankurk> ph88: colorbox should be
[05:34:43] <ankurk> slax0r: what you exepct from this fiddler?
[05:34:52] <ph88> thx
[05:35:12] <slax0r> ankurk: fiddler works ok
[05:35:16] <slax0r> my code doesn't
[05:35:59] <decx> slax0r the hex has to be well formed <p>aaa</p> will work but <p> aaa</p> wont
[05:36:07] <ankurk____> damn I had this username few months ago
[05:36:29] <ankurk> slax0r: you sure the $(this) is what you expect to be?
[05:36:29] <slax0r> decx: it's well formed
[05:36:41] <slax0r> yes, because I receive the right text from it
[05:37:09] <slax0r> and it works as well if I manually write the color hex into into the function
[05:37:15] <decx> try to recreate it in a fiddle ;)
[05:37:23] <ankurk> so you get the hex text but when you set the css doesnt work
[05:37:23] <slax0r> I did
[05:37:25] <slax0r> and it works :/
[05:37:38] <decx> with the same markup?`
[05:37:49] <slax0r> yes
[05:38:28] <ankurk> slax0r: just for testing purpose, try instead of the hex code to put a classname "red" and use the same each, see if the class is applied right
[05:38:43] <slax0r> http://jsfiddle.net/7MfhQ/1/
[05:38:46] <decx> i'd say put the color in a data field instead of relying on text
[05:39:03] <ankurk> i agree with decx, was going to say taht aswell
[05:39:15] <slax0r> decx: if I could, I'd write it directly to style, but it's not an option
[05:39:34] <decx> even a break will kill text
[05:39:46] <decx> data attribute would be safer
[05:39:58] <slax0r> it works with classes
[05:40:09] <decx> yeah but it's data ;)
[05:40:57] <slax0r> decx: I know, but I have no option to change how it is printed out
[05:42:00] <decx> ugh, inflexible markup
[05:42:07] <decx> yuk
[05:42:38] <xKraty> slax0r: so read the color put it in the data-color and re-read
[05:42:42] <xKraty> might work lol
[05:43:11] <decx> $(this).text().replace(' ','') to replace spaces that smuggle themselves in there
[05:43:19] <slax0r> and if not, read it and write it to a database using ajax and retreive it back, right?
[05:43:30] <decx> that's ridiculous
[05:43:43] <xKraty> uh decx is right
[05:43:46] <xKraty> you should trim spaces
[05:44:12] <slax0r> there are no spaces
[05:44:12] <xKraty> could be that since you .text it, it get some random space
[05:44:18] <slax0r> and as expected trimming didn't do anything :/
[05:44:46] <slax0r> .html() doesn't cut it either
[05:44:59] <xKraty> if you console.log('|' + color + '|') you get the right hex withou the #?
[05:45:08] <slax0r> yes
[05:45:26] <decx> without knowing more details about the setup there's no way to debug something that works fine
[05:45:48] <slax0r> well, tell me what you need to know :)
[05:45:53] <xKraty> try background instead of background-color
[05:46:00] <xKraty> slax0r: don't you have a live demo?
[05:48:14] <slax0r> xKraty: yes, here it is: http://mltest.blanc-noir.at/de/chasuble-de-luxe2
[05:48:31] <slax0r> on the right side, there is a "Wahlen Sie eine Farbe" text, right of that is an arrow
[05:48:34] <slax0r> click on it
[05:48:47] <slax0r> it opens two boxes that contain this p element that should get the background
[05:48:50] <ankurk_> finally changed my username :P
[05:48:57] <decx> ff000
[05:49:02] <decx> that's not a valid hex
[05:49:08] <decx> neither is red
[05:49:25] <slax0r> for red I know
[05:49:26] <slax0r> but omfg
[05:49:29] <slax0r> I missed a 0
[05:49:30] <slax0r> now I see
[05:49:31] <slax0r> :/
[05:49:46] <slax0r> omg
[05:49:53] <decx> how's xtcommerce nowadays?
[05:49:53] * slax0r burries himself in shame
[05:49:57] <slax0r> crap
[05:49:59] <slax0r> as always...
[05:50:02] <decx> so is oxid
[05:50:11] <decx> damn german language markets
[05:50:12] <slax0r> I really don't have much to do with it, thank god, am on a different project
[05:50:20] <slax0r> I'm just helping out here today and tomorrow for a presentation
[05:50:21] <decx> would love to to shopify
[05:50:24] <xKraty> ahahaha
[05:50:33] <decx> do*
[05:51:01] <decx> it's always either oxid, xt or magento here
[05:51:04] <decx> all shit
[05:51:06] <decx> :D
[05:51:48] <slax0r> "smart" germans...
[05:51:58] <slax0r> I've used opencart in all my private shop projects
[05:52:09] <slax0r> haven't had 1/4 of a problem than with xtc
[05:52:30] <ankurk_> I should really start some side projects, since I will be applying to full time gigs very soon
[05:52:42] <decx> i just slap a paypal express checkout on a static page ;)
[05:53:39] <ankurk_> Those who are full time devs, how was your experience when you applied to full time jobs?
[05:54:10] <xKraty> ankurk_: i was just out from school lol
[05:54:12] <slax0r> private projects only
[05:54:25] <slax0r> no work experience
[05:54:29] <slax0r> but some refferences
[05:54:38] <ankurk_> so references matter
[05:54:44] <ankurk_> I don't have much but still
[05:54:51] <slax0r> depends...
[05:55:09] <xKraty> i've been lucky here, they took me just after school and teached me
[05:55:21] <xKraty> so after 2 years or so i've got a stable contract
[05:55:23] <slax0r> but if someone tells me they don't care what I've done in my spare time, I can only tell them that I don't care how much they need a dev
[05:55:27] <xKraty> worked my ass off
[05:55:46] <slax0r> anyway
[05:55:50] <slax0r> back to the salt mines
[05:55:57] <xKraty> lol
[05:55:59] <slax0r> this frontend stuff is getting on my nerves :/
[05:56:04] <slax0r> thanks for the help
[05:56:07] <ankurk_> I really need to brush up my skills, I am still rusty
[05:56:11] <decx> who wants to test some platformer physics?
[05:56:15] <xKraty> np
[05:56:27] <xKraty> decx: wut :O ?
[05:56:29] <decx> is jumping around fun? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/rbpsv/3/show/
[05:57:05] <xKraty> lol awesome
[05:58:53] <xKraty> decx: if i close my self into blocks i get pushed out
[05:59:31] <decx> yes collision works but there are a couple of edge cases that need ironing out ;)
[06:00:18] <xKraty> it's cool the empty level i feel like travelling into deep space :D
[06:00:40] <decx> and you can even build a space station ^^
[06:01:14] <xKraty> you rock :|
[06:01:39] <decx> hey it cant be that complicated if i did it lol
[06:02:33] <xKraty> never tried canvas
[06:03:29] <decx> start with moving an image around on screen randomly
[06:03:36] <decx> and then go from there
[06:03:48] <xKraty> i did that in flash!
[06:03:54] <decx> yeah it's not that different
[06:04:02] <xKraty> once i wanted to learn flash, and i made that square moving
[06:04:07] <xKraty> all thing i did in flash lol
[06:04:20] <decx> tween it baby !
[06:04:30] <decx> the actionscripters look at us in disgust
[06:04:38] <xKraty> yeah
[06:04:45] <xKraty> i didnt felt good with it
[06:05:02] <xKraty> i feel more comfortable in using software like after effect
[06:05:11] <xKraty> and make awesome useless video!
[06:05:18] <decx> i just started with canvas because it's a more rewarding way to get into native js from just using jquery
[06:05:46] <decx> dealing with normal dom manipulation is boring
[06:05:49] <xKraty> :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIwibIYs4jM
[06:06:19] <xKraty> yeah but you need some complex project for use canvas
[06:06:30] <decx> cool effects :>
[06:06:36] <xKraty> here we have complex things but never needed something so powerfull
[06:06:52] <xKraty> yeah i like lights effects and BOOM SBENG PEW BING
[06:07:07] <xKraty> took me over an hour for put everysingle sound xD
[06:07:55] <xKraty> it's another awesome world the video making, need a clone
[06:08:02] <xKraty> xKraty.clone()
[06:08:17] * xKraty xKraty_  is now live
[06:08:24] <xKraty> so ankurk_ is a clone too?
[06:08:41] <ankurk_> Nope :P
[06:08:43] <decx> yeah i wanted to get into video editing too, but you can only do so much at the same time
[06:09:25] <decx> we need another youtuber, there's only 300 million left !
[06:09:34] <xKraty> lol
[06:09:44] <Fr0n> wow so much action of you both
[06:10:09] <Fr0n> can i get now my intern please
[06:10:37] <xKraty> lol
[06:10:46] <ankurk_> lol interns ftw
[06:10:59] <ankurk_> wish I could stay as an intern
[06:11:00] <Fr0n> well nice day to all of you
[06:11:13] <Fr0n> or night, sleep etc haha
[06:11:17] <DarkGhost> hey everyone, curious do any of you know how to make the padding match when its done with animation so it deosn't do that jump? http://brandonmax.net/dev/
[06:12:37] <FullContactCoder> How can I listen to an <output> with JQuery and fire an event based upon the change?
[06:12:45] <xKraty> DarkGhost: why don't you make it with css3?
[06:12:59] <FullContactCoder> Actually, just the listening bit, the firing of the event I can sort :)
[06:13:10] <DarkGhost> i tried xKraty  i didn't know how because it's not an hover think
[06:13:11] <DarkGhost> its on dom
[06:13:24] <DarkGhost> you're talking about transition-
[06:13:24] <DarkGhost> right
[06:13:41] <xKraty> wait i have a link for you
[06:13:52] <xKraty> http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/
[06:14:19] <xKraty> it's not what you need but you can understand lots from it
[06:14:49] <xKraty> you should make an animation with the keyframes
[06:15:01] <xKraty> it can be executed only once
[06:15:03] <DarkGhost> hmm ok
[06:15:09] <DarkGhost> i dont understand "keyframes" lol sorry
[06:15:23] <DarkGhost> oh its a css style?
[06:15:25] <DarkGhost> webkit-frames
[06:15:25] <DarkGhost> ?
[06:15:37] <xKraty> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes
[06:15:51] <xKraty> @keyframes identifier {
[06:15:51] <xKraty>   0% { top: 0; left: 0; }
[06:15:51] <xKraty>   30% { top: 50px; }
[06:15:53] <xKraty>   68%, 72% { left: 50px; }
[06:15:55] <xKraty>   100% { top: 100px; left: 100%; }
[06:15:57] <xKraty> }
[06:16:16] <DarkGhost> crazy.
[06:16:40] <xKraty> on your .nav { transition: identifier 2s etc etc
[06:21:22] <DarkGhost> something liek this xKraty ?
[06:21:23] <DarkGhost> http://jsfiddle.net/7TfhY/
[06:23:51] <xKraty> DarkGhost: yeah, awesome
[06:24:11] <DarkGhost> xKraty how do you make it stay there
[06:24:16] <DarkGhost> it goes back to originial values
[06:25:05] <xKraty> 1 sec
[06:25:11] <decx> define the finished position in your main class
[06:25:34] <decx> that gives you better degredation anyway
[06:25:46] <decx> degra*
[06:27:32] <decx> you can still have a callback for jquery btw, element.on('webkitAnimationEnd animationend msAnimationEnd oAnimationEnd', function () {}) and element.on('webkitTransitionEnd transitionend msTransitionEnd oTransitionEnd', function () {})
[06:28:06] <Cork> decx: don't forget the other combos for the events
[06:28:17] <decx> there's a shitload yes
[06:28:29] <Cork> ya
[06:28:45] <Cork> i think webkit (might have been opera) went through a load of different names...
[06:29:11] <decx> blinkAnimationEnd? ;)
[06:29:35] <Cork> luckely blink doens't have it's own prefix
[06:29:39] <decx> mosaicModemsoundEnd
[06:30:02] <xKraty> decx: i tried those callback once but i didn't trust it much
[06:30:28] <decx> better than copying the duration from the css and having a settimeout :>
[06:30:38] <decx> i did that before i knew about those callbacks
[06:30:42] <decx> they work well for me
[06:30:59] <Cork> decx: also ms never omplemented a prefixed version
[06:31:05] <Cork> *implemented
[06:31:16] <xKraty> DarkGhost: http://jsfiddle.net/7TfhY/2/ as Cork or decx said just add it to the class
[06:31:38] <decx> hm why is it in my little paste file for stuff
[06:31:40] <DarkGhost> i seee
[06:31:41] <DarkGhost> thank you
[06:31:56] <Cork> decx: prob just a blank "all prefixes" :)
[06:32:03] <decx> probably
[06:32:18] <Cork> decx: mozilla unprefixed a long list of things at the same time as microsoft implemented it
[06:32:38] <Cork> though events was desided a longtime a go that it is a bad idea to prefix those
[06:33:03] <Cork> (and prefixes for css properties has been stopped since about two years)
[06:33:04] <decx> ah
[06:33:06] <decx> i know
[06:33:19] <decx> ie10 has had mstransitionend for like 5 minutes
[06:33:24] <decx> -has
[06:33:27] <Cork> lol
[06:33:42] <Cork> well mozilla had it for a long time
[06:33:44] <xKraty> you guys write everytime all prefixes?
[06:33:57] <decx> at least -webkit
[06:34:02] <decx> or you lose out on mobile
[06:34:19] <Cork> xKraty: i use a scss function
[06:34:23] <Cork> so no not really
[06:34:29] <xKraty> compass!
[06:34:34] <Cork> decx: and only using one prefix is really bad
[06:34:58] <Cork> @include vendor-prefix(transition-delay, "0s, 300ms"); <-- :)
[06:35:04] <Cork> quite nice to read too
[06:35:58] <xKraty> yeah
[06:36:08] <xKraty> i m trying to migrate all my collegue to compass/sass
[06:36:34] <Cork> css4 might make much of scss useless though :)
[06:36:50] <xKraty> otherwise prefixfree js aint that bad
[06:37:08] <xKraty> scss might become css4
[06:37:15] <Cork> not really
[06:37:23] <decx> that's another 20 years until w3c is settling on a final sepc for css4
[06:37:30] <Cork> but they are thinking about adding much of the nice things from it
[06:37:44] <Cork> decx: css doesn't work like that any more
[06:37:48] <Cork> they work with modules instead
[06:38:03] <Cork> and a module lands as soon as there is agreement on how it should work
[06:38:04] <decx> actually it's at the mercy of browser vendors isnt it
[06:38:19] <Cork> and css variables is close to landing as a stable spec
[06:38:29] <Cork> decx: all standards are
[06:38:43] <decx> welp, sad truth
[06:38:48] <Cork> heck the standard is made BY the browser vendors
[06:38:59] <Cork> decx: i don't see what is sad about it
[06:39:10] <decx> it's sad that i still have to use -webkit ;)
[06:39:25] <Cork> decx: blame apple
[06:39:41] <Cork> they are the ones that refuse to deprecate old -webkit prefixes
[06:39:45] <decx> oh you want a gradient? her have 50 prefixes with different syntaxes
[06:39:48] <decx> *here
[06:43:29] <decx> what i can blame apple?
[06:43:34] <decx> don't mind if i do :>
[06:44:14] <Cork> decx: the reason why they removed the prefix from the standard process was cause apple refused to remove old prefixes
[06:44:26] <Cork> and even pushed developers to ONLY use there prefix
[06:44:40] <decx> yeah didnt firefox mobile implement -webkit support?
[06:44:45] <Cork> and that cause a lot of fake browser incompatibility on the web
[06:44:57] <Cork> decx: they tested and looked hard at it
[06:45:02] <decx> because mobile is so besmirched with it
[06:45:04] <Cork> but didn't find enough gain from doing it
[06:45:10] <Cork> instead they unprefixed a long list
[06:45:11] <decx> that doesnt sound like the right word, besmirched
[06:45:16] <decx> polluted :>
[06:46:11] <Cork> cause the few sites that only used -webkit and not any other prefix or the standard name was also often broken in other ways
[06:46:25] <Cork> like coded for webkit rendering bugs and so on
[06:46:47] <Cork> but they did implement a test patch where they cloned all prefixes
[06:46:56] <Cork> and even did a convertion for -webkit-gradient()
[06:46:57] <ankurk_> So I am trying to filter using multiple selects and combine them and it's giving me an error, http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/23/edit
[06:47:25] <decx> aren't you getting mad looking at that table?
[06:47:53] <Cork> ankurk_: merging?
[06:48:14] <ankurk_> decx: you don't know how much mad I am
[06:48:30] <ankurk_> Cork: yeah, merging multiple selects and then filtering
[06:48:48] <Cork> ankurk_: where is the merging?
[06:48:55] <Cork> all i can find is sort
[06:50:30] <ankurk_> give me a moment Cork
[06:51:17] <xKraty> where are selects?
[06:51:28] <ankurk_> you're going to http://jsbin.com/nalomuje/23/edit right?
[06:51:44] <ankurk_> try this instead, http://jsbin.com/ronoconu/1/edit
[06:52:17] <xKraty> oh fck you took me 3 min to reindent your previous gist :\
[06:52:18] <Cork> ankurk_: another question
[06:52:31] <Cork> why arn't you storing the results of your sorts and filters?
[06:52:49] <ankurk_> hmm, that's one mistake I did :/
[06:53:25] <ankurk_> Initially I was doing this for individual filters, http://jsbin.com/busobumo/1/edit
[06:53:48] <Cork> ankurk_: also you arn't using anything from the $table_row in the filter loop
[06:54:18] <Cork> you just constantly looping it and using 4 variables defined before the filter
[06:54:58] <ankurk_> hmm
[06:55:02] <ankurk_> damn
[06:58:05] <ankurk_> I wish jsbin had a formatting feature, xKraty
[06:58:26] <xKraty> you can implement jsformattedbin
[06:58:40] <xec> ctrl+a -> shift+tab
[06:59:12] <ankurk_> what I did now still filters individually, may be I need to store filter results as Cork said
[06:59:13] <xKraty> lol
[06:59:23] <ankurk_> xec: thanks for the tip!
[06:59:43] <xKraty> yeah thanks xec
[06:59:47] <xKraty> btw ankurk
[07:00:20] <xKraty> you want them filter all together
[07:00:30] <xKraty> if you filter by a & b
[07:00:48] <xKraty> the table rows must have a || b or a && b ?
[07:01:11] <ankurk_> I am just trying by &&, just a sec
[07:02:36] <ankurk_> It still doesn't work
[07:03:09] <xKraty> there is some optimization you can aswell
[07:03:56] <ankurk_> I want it like this, for example, I want to see rows with high priority then I want to see high priority rows which have on air critical as yes
[07:04:12] <ankurk_> xKraty: my code needs a lot of optimization!
[07:04:26] <xKraty> hold on
[07:05:37] <xKraty> ankurk_: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/37545f5bd3a3d20b0b73 didnt resist yo optimize your sort function lol
[07:05:43] <xKraty> now i check your problem xD
[07:06:29] <ankurk_> lol
[07:09:28] <xKraty> in your gist if 1 of that is verified the row is shown
[07:09:52] <ankurk_> yeah
[07:10:05] <xKraty> but you want to filter by AND not OR
[07:10:18] <ankurk_> yep basically
[07:10:28] <ankurk_> I want combine those three if user wants too
[07:11:03] <xKraty> so if you use OR in the function you failed at begin
[07:13:57] <ankurk_> yeah
[07:14:20] <ankurk_> I tried with AND but isn't showing what I want
[07:14:26] <xKraty> i'm not getting what you did there
[07:14:37] <xKraty> someone helped you or you made it?
[07:15:12] <xKraty> basically if you make another filter like
[07:15:17] <xKraty> critical
[07:15:31] <xKraty> with yes/no option it will fck or your filtering
[07:16:22] <ankurk_> I made it :P
[07:16:31] <xKraty> it's totally wrong
[07:16:37] <xKraty> cause you look for the value in every field
[07:16:40] <ankurk_> hmm, I guessed so
[07:16:47] <xKraty> but you have to look for critical in critical etc
[07:17:56] <ankurk_> Let's have a test case, Suppose I want to see rows which have Medium & Yes. I tried that with AND and it didn't work
[07:19:13] <ankurk_> now I am thinking that I should include rows that are hidden using filtering too
[07:19:19] <xKraty> cause you look in all fields
[07:19:32] <xKraty> gimme some minute
[07:20:09] <ankurk_> sure
[07:30:54] <blue_warlock> hello
[07:31:11] <blue_warlock> why this script wont slide down the div ?
[07:31:15] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Lavvh/15/
[07:31:29] <blue_warlock> only opacity its working
[07:31:53] <blue_warlock> want to make effect slidedown + fade in
[07:32:04] <decx> it can'T slide down, it's already slid down
[07:32:21] <decx> slideDown works on elements with display: none
[07:32:35] <blue_warlock> ah
[07:32:45] <blue_warlock> so i need just to add display none in css?
[07:33:13] <blue_warlock> yes it works lol
[07:33:25] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/Lavvh/16/
[07:33:29] <blue_warlock> thanks man
[07:33:51] <jarry1250__> Hi all, I'm just getting started with JSONP, and I wondered why these two are not equivalent: http://jsfiddle.net/t6RZj/1/
[07:33:57] <xKraty> ankurk_: damn you
[07:34:16] <ankurk_> what
[07:34:20] <ankurk_> o.O
[07:34:24] <xKraty> it's struggling me again lol
[07:34:51] <decx> yeah i would have to get paid to expose myself to debugging table sorting. that can break every man ;)
[07:35:44] <xKraty> decx: i'll send him an invoice
[07:36:20] <decx> 1x psychological torment 19% vat 999€
[07:36:49] <ankurk_> lol I would send some beers instead
[07:36:59] <decx> hehe
[07:37:34] <xKraty> decx: see? i don't even drink and he wants to send me beers!
[07:38:15] <decx> what an italian that doesnt drink?
[07:38:36] <decx> my italian great grandfather is rotating in his grave so hard he's becoming a pulsar star
[07:39:57] <ankurk_> lol
[07:40:37] <xKraty> i stopped drink when i took my driving license
[07:40:56] <xKraty> i m not really lucky, i'd have loose it by drinking coca cola :\
[07:41:06] <decx> lol
[07:42:30] <ankurk_> Well, i have stopped too :P
[07:44:30] <xKraty> ankurk_: i'm missing something http://jsbin.com/ronoconu/2/edit
[07:44:54] <xKraty> ankurk_: but it's almost 17 o'clock here and i'm going in "yeah 1hour to go home!" mode
[07:45:16] <ankurk_> you will leave in one hour :P lucky you
[07:45:28] <ankurk_> I still have so much time to leave office
[07:45:36] <xKraty> ankurk_: i edited your code to get all active filters and in the .filter it cycle those filters
[07:45:52] <xKraty> but i'm not used to use .filters so fix that last step!
[07:46:10] <xKraty> and check the 1function sorting lol
[07:46:27] <ankurk_> yeah I will try to fix that
[07:46:38] <ankurk_> but I am trying something on my end too
[07:46:47] <xKraty> you understand the code?
[07:49:21] <ankurk_> little bit :P
[08:02:39] <xKraty> ankurk_: :\
[08:03:28] <ankurk_> it's little bit complicated for me :P
[08:04:18] <xKraty> nah it's not!
[08:04:31] <xKraty> you used a function that i don't know so you can do it! :D
[08:05:48] <ankurk_> I can do it, yeah :D
[08:21:32] <xKraty> ankurk_: i'm not getting it sorry :\
[08:21:59] <ankurk_> ahh I can understand xKraty, you have already helped me a lot :)
[08:22:09] <xKraty> now i have to finish some shit for tomorrow =|
[08:22:20] <xKraty> so sorry
[08:22:32] <ankurk_> no problems man!
[08:22:38] <xKraty> ttyl
[08:22:40] <ankurk_> don't want to interrupt your work!
[08:22:46] <ankurk_> ttyl! :)
[08:23:01] <EnlightenMental> anyone have a preference on lazyload image lib?  I'm having a heck of a time getting isotope and lazyload to work together
[08:30:59] <decx> isotope does positioning with translate3d and lazyload just checks the offset to be above the fold iirc
[08:31:23] <decx> technically the isotope elements are all on the same position
[08:32:30] <EnlightenMental> decx, thats part of my issue
[08:32:52] <EnlightenMental> decx: changing to jquery for the engine helps some.. but Ive seen working examples of the css3 method
[08:33:05] <decx> you'll probably have to roll your own lazyload
[08:33:11] <EnlightenMental> ultimately though.. the loading is jenky.. and not consistant
[08:33:41] <decx> but checking every elements translate3d y on every scroll might be slow as well
[08:35:02] <EnlightenMental> my end goal, was to build something with isotope/masonry + infinitescroll + lazy load
[08:35:09] <EnlightenMental> but its become a mess
[08:35:22] <EnlightenMental> http://jsfiddle.net/arthurc/ZnEhn/ <= proof of css3 lazyload
[08:39:48] <decx> why dont these external js dont load for me
[08:48:44] <pachet> decx so they *are* loading?
[08:52:09] <decx> had to switch into work mode sorry

[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> goooooooood morning folks
[09:04:43] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Mornan'
[09:11:35] <duch_kazatel> :B
[09:12:25] <d0de> morning dutch
[09:14:25] <BillCriswell> Trying out this Atom editor. I usually enjoy breaking things, but not my text editor.
[09:14:35] <duch_kazatel> how is it so far?
[09:16:04] <BillCriswell> Eh. Not different enough from Sublime to put up with the bullshit yet.
[09:16:09] <BillCriswell> I like the idea of being able to edit my editor through CSS, but it's not always easy accomplishing what I want.
[09:17:01] <BillCriswell> I like the scroll_past_end in Sublime but I'm having trouble doing that with CSS oddly enough... You would assume just some bottom padding but it's not that simple.
[09:17:23] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[09:19:14] <decx> i gave brackets a good week
[09:19:20] <decx> a week too long
[09:19:25] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[09:19:54] <decx> doesnt even pass the startup test
[09:20:08] <decx> if i cick my editor i want to be exactly where i left of in under a second
[09:20:09] <BillCriswell> decx: Thats no fun.
[09:20:18] <decx> off*
[09:20:26] <BillCriswell> I feel like Atom just needs more time, I think it'll get good.
[09:20:45] <BillCriswell> It was nice, I could change the line height with a simple .editor { line-height: 150%; }
[09:21:21] <ninev> i have a parent document with a tag <customtag1> and that has an iframe in it, then an iframe is inside that iframe with some code trying to find customtag1's name... does anyone know how i can find it properly... (if i duplicate this on the same page but have customtag2 with two iframes in it and use .find or .closest they both find customtag1)
[09:21:33] <duch_kazatel> ninev you cannot use custom tags.
[09:22:44] <petey> Can anyone help me here? I'm looking to take an JSON feed, and add new data every time I click "add new data"
[09:22:44] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zehutiju/1/edit
[09:22:52] <petey> I have something working, but what it does now is create a new array every time
[09:23:09] <petey> I want to load the data once, then I guess transfer everything to one array, then add stuff to that array as I click "load more"
[09:24:59] <BillCriswell> petey: It sounds like you want .push() but I'm having a hard time following that in your code.
[09:25:12] <petey> Yeah BillCriswell, that's what I want to do
[09:25:19] <petey> I just don't know how to push something into loaded Data
[09:25:39] <ninev> ok i changed them to divs, then i gave them both the same id, and different class names, and they both find the same class name now
[09:25:42] <petey> how do you push the next item from something you load with json?
[09:25:47] <petey> Does that make sense?
[09:26:03] <duch_kazatel> ninev are the two divs on the same page?
[09:26:14] <ninev> ya they are on the top page
[09:26:14] <duch_kazatel> ninev because IDs must be unique.
[09:26:20] <duch_kazatel> classes can be the same.
[09:26:26] <ninev> ok ill try that
[09:27:39] <BillCriswell> petey: Let's say I have like var data = {"success":true,results:[1,2,3,4,5]}; form a result and I wanted to add to results I would do data.results.push(6);
[09:28:19] <petey> how do you add stuff that's already loaded?
[09:28:37] <duch_kazatel> petey the loaded content is like any other var.
[09:28:39] <petey> so I pull a json with 10 items in it, I place 5 of those items into an array because I only want to load the first 5 items
[09:28:40] <ninev> if i want it to traverse up the dom tree from a nested iframe to the parent page and find the closest thing with class of 'testing' what would i use ?
[09:28:58] <petey> and once you click "load more" it loads the 6th, 7th, 8th, etc.
[09:29:38] <ninev> its <main page> <div id='uniqueid1' class='testing'> <iframe><iframe><code here></iframe></iframe> </div> (the iframes are separate pages its just for example)
[09:29:38] <duch_kazatel> ninev it'll be something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7758062/traverse-from-element-within-iframe-to-parent-iframe-tag
[09:29:49] <duch_kazatel> ninev btw <main page> is not a valid tag either.
[09:29:54] <BillCriswell> petey: It sounds like maybe you want break the array into chunks?
[09:30:08] <petey> BillCriswell, yes. Let's see if I can figure that out. be back in a minute
[09:30:12] <duch_kazatel> ninev why are you traversing around iframes like that?
[09:30:21] <ninev> can it find the closest div
[09:31:13] <duch_kazatel> ninev start by fixing your html.
[09:31:20] <duch_kazatel> ninev there's also this https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.frameElement
[09:31:26] <ninev> that was just an example since its on different pages
[09:31:51] <duch_kazatel> ninev why are you traversing around iframes like that?
[09:32:14] <ninev> for a video game
[09:32:21] <Jattenalle> hey guys, i have an issue with jquery ui, i have a button, with a tooltip set on it.. works fine.. but when i disable the button, using .button('disable').. the tooltip still triggers on mouseover.. but it doesnt fade when mouseout... so tooltip just remains visible forever after that
[09:32:35] <duch_kazatel> that's a bad idea.  spinning up whole new documents like that doens't make much sense.
[09:45:19] <petey> I'm stuck
[09:45:20] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zehutiju/1/edit
[09:45:55] <nhulea_nsa> howdy !
[09:47:56] <orf_> I have a table on a page, each row contains a log message. it is updated via JavaScript
[09:48:02] <orf_> *via websockets
[09:48:18] <orf_> I want to make sure there are only 1000 rows in the table
[09:48:40] <orf_> so for every row I add I delete the first child of the table
[09:48:45] <orf_> but this is very very slow
[09:48:57] <orf_> what's the most efficient way to achieve this?
[09:56:12] <_rgn> orf_: that doesn't sound like slow..
[09:56:14] <devslash> I wrote this code in a popup window to load a url in the parent window. http://pastebin.com/6TVP1VjV when I close the popup (child) window, the parent window never loads the url. does anyone know why this wouldnt work ?
[09:56:24] <BillCriswell> orf_: Hmm.
[09:57:54] <BillCriswell> _rgn: Is the removal slow or the adding?
[09:58:12] <orf_> hahaha
[09:58:19] <orf_> I was selecting on td rather than tr
[09:58:30] <BillCriswell> orf_: Ah there you go...
[09:58:43] <BillCriswell> _rgn: My bad didn't mean to alert you haha
[09:58:55] <orf_> that explains the slowdown XD
[09:59:16] <_rgn> np
[09:59:24] <devslash> is there anything in JavaScript spec that says that prevents you from modifying the parent windows' URL ?
[10:00:01] <BillCriswell> devslash: Never tried it.
[10:00:41] <devslash> in the console of the child window i can manually load the url
[10:09:04] <devslash> is anyone here ?
[10:12:49] <BillCriswell> 794 people ot be exact.
[10:13:14] <devslash> no one is chatting. doesnt matter how many people are idling in here :p
[10:14:51] <devslash> this is my code http://pastebin.com/kNYsidyc the function in the parent window is not executing
[10:23:46] <duch_kazatel> devslash try putting your code in a jsfiddle
[10:25:39] <petey> So I have a better example of what I'm trying to do
[10:25:45] <caciavar> Hi all... I'm not sure where to go for help but I have some questions about a json array
[10:25:55] <petey> I have created what I want to do, but I don't know how to do it while loading json
[10:25:56] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zewof/1/edit
[10:26:14] <petey> what I want to do I did fine with numbers, but I have no idea how to do it inside the loadData() correctly
[10:26:21] <devslash> duch_kazatel, thats not possible because i have a parent and child window
[10:26:33] <devslash> the code on pastebin is the code in the child window
[10:27:36] <duch_kazatel> devslash so you want to know if you can modify the parent window URL?
[10:27:46] <duch_kazatel> depending on how the iframe is embedded, it might matter.
[10:27:46] <petey> my question is how do i access the data from the other function?
[10:28:17] <madalin_> Hello. Can someone point me to a direction where i have two forms (one for image uploading with preview) and one for all the rest of the fields..i'd like to be able to upload images without using a form..maybe with ajax post ?
[10:28:34] <bl> hi guys, in my site, i have a number that i would like to .onclick to cycle through different toFixed() positions to change the number of decimals. i would like to cycle from an integer to up to 4 decimal positions. here is the site so far www.basic-laser.com/100b
[10:28:42] <devslash> duch_kazatel,i want to call a function in the parent window which will do that for me
[10:29:16] <jphase> petey: it looks like you need to pass your data into your pushData function.
[10:29:43] <petey> Does that mean I need to return data then, jphase?
[10:30:04] <jphase> petey: yeah either pass/return it or make data global
[10:30:28] <duch_kazatel> devslash check out window.parent -> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.parent
[10:30:36] <petey> I don't want to make it global, I do want to return it to be able to use it inside another function
[10:30:47] <niladam> How can someone post to a file without submiting the MAIN form ?
[10:31:15] <jphase> niladam: ajax
[10:31:27] <niladam> jphase: can you point me to some docs maybe ?
[10:31:30] <devslash> im using window.opener not window.parent since I tried window.parent first didnt work
[10:31:45] <duch_kazatel> devslash so it's from a popup window?
[10:31:51] <devslash> yes
[10:32:02] <jphase> niladam: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/   or   https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:32:40] <duch_kazatel> devslash check this out then: ://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[10:32:41] <duch_kazatel> [2014:02:27:10:32:12] * fikst (~fikst@2a02:1810:3813:2b00:e9d9:d11b:855e:819b) Quit (Quit
[10:32:42] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[10:32:47] <duch_kazatel> http://chiragrdarji.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/call-parent-windows-javascript-function-from-child-window-or-passing-data-from-child-window-to-parent-window-in-javascript/
[10:32:48] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[10:33:39] <duch_kazatel> window.opener is the parent window, fwiw
[10:33:41] <jphase> bl: what seems to be the problem?
[10:33:42] <devslash> thats pretty much what i am doing.
[10:34:10] <devslash> in the child window i have this code: $(window).bind("beforeunload", function() {
[10:34:10] <devslash> 	  	window.opener.refreshTable();
[10:34:11] <devslash> 	  	console.log("1");
[10:34:11] <devslash> 	  });
[10:34:26] <duch_kazatel> don't paste code into the channel, please :)
[10:34:27] <jphase> try not to paste multiline code in here devslash ;)
[10:34:35] <petey> jphase: am I making any headway here? It seems to work
[10:34:35] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/1/edit
[10:34:39] <devslash> it runs if I execute window.opener.refreshTable() manually but not in this event
[10:34:58] <petey> so I return loadData with the data, and then loadData takes it and consoles it all out
[10:35:08] <petey> is that correct?
[10:35:22] <jphase> petey: the return from done won't do much there really
[10:35:27] <duch_kazatel> try $(window).on('beforeunload'
[10:35:32] <duch_kazatel> instead of using .bind
[10:35:37] <jphase> petey: but passing data into loadData is correct yes
[10:35:44] <devslash> sorry guys I meant to paste that as a single line
[10:35:49] <petey> jphase so how else would I structure this?
[10:36:01] <petey> do I even need the .done there then? I was looking to write a promise
[10:36:07] <devslash> doesnt work either
[10:36:17] <duch_kazatel> devslash is your console tossing any errors?
[10:36:24] <devslash> on the parent or client side ?
[10:36:28] <duch_kazatel> both.
[10:36:40] <devslash> not that i can see no
[10:36:59] <davearel_> fyi, if you have an opinion regarding modular dependency management in jQuery, nows the time to contribute: https://gist.github.com/davearel/9254418
[10:36:59] <duch_kazatel> try to console.log window.opener.refreshTable();
[10:37:01] <jphase> petey: .done will work fine to execute code after the json is received. you can then just call something like loadData(data); inside there and data will be available to that function
[10:37:14] <devslash> what do you mean ?
[10:37:19] <jphase> petey: lol @ "earthporn"
[10:37:42] <petey> Haha, jphase
[10:37:43] <duch_kazatel> devslash do a console.og of window.opener.refreshTable(); - you need to see if that even references anything.
[10:37:56] <devslash> i did in the console window
[10:38:25] <devslash> in the child window i opened up console and can manually call the function refreshTable. i put a breakpoint in the parent window and can see that it is executing
[10:39:04] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you in?  because the beforeunload event is funky.
[10:39:12] <devslash> chrome
[10:39:20] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/beforeunload
[10:39:22] <jphase> petey: loadData(); right after the function doesn't do much there. I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do here. Explain what you need
[10:40:04] <devslash> duch_kazatel, I am using jQuery convention for the beforeunload event
[10:40:11] <petey> jphase: as a precursor - I'm trying to split everything up into different functions. getData() - get data from the server, loadData() - console.log out all the data that was loaded, pushData() push data into another array
[10:40:32] <petey> The big picture here is to load some data and display the first 3 results. after you press "click me" you load another result
[10:40:43] <petey> you can press "click me" until there are no more results left
[10:40:51] <duch_kazatel> devslash I think you're confused - the event itself is inconsistent.  i do not think jquery fixes this though I could be wrong.  also - .bind() was deprecated a while ago iirc.
[10:41:20] <jphase> petey: oic, I'd "daisy-chain" your functions then perhaps. in .done - loadData(data);  at the bottom of loadData - pushData(data)  etc. etc.
[10:41:53] <jphase> petey: you could alternatively just call each function from .done and pass data into each of them
[10:42:00] <petey> jphase: do you think this strategy is reasonably ok?
[10:42:21] <jphase> should be just fine, kind of hard to say for sure with console logs being the only thing in your functions, but yes
[10:42:29] <petey> .done ( loadData(data) pushData(data)) ?
[10:42:36] <petey> AH yeah sorry, I'm just trying to work this all out in my head
[10:42:40] <jphase> yeah, those should be synchronous at that point
[10:42:42] <petey> I will probably remove them
[10:42:48] <petey> I don't even need the loadData quite honestly
[10:42:57] <petey> here hold on a se
[10:43:00] <jphase> .done will be after async events fire, so your function calls will all happen in order
[10:43:21] <jphase> assuming there's no asyncies inside those functions - again hard to say with console logs
[10:44:16] <duch_kazatel> devslash also: be aware that you might be tripping up some security things unintentionally - I would look at something like this: stackoverflow.com/questions/1112340/how-to-run-function-of-parent-window-when-child-window-closes
[10:44:57] <petey> jphase: http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/1/edit
[10:45:02] <petey> that should be better
[10:46:06] <jphase> petey: that looks fine as it currently stands, sure.
[10:46:14] <petey> so now all im missing is pushData()
[10:46:21] <petey> which should push a new item to the array and display a new image
[10:46:45] <petey> so at the bottom I have clickMe which loads pushData, the thing is - what data do I push in the parameters?
[10:47:09] <jphase> petey: I'd say that the click function would fire the getJSON call
[10:47:31] <petey> but I want the page to load with 2 images first
[10:48:01] <jphase> well you don't have data until the getJSON is done
[10:48:29] <jphase> and without making something global (within the getData closure) then you won't be able to access that
[10:48:38] <Tomashe> Hey guys , i got a script with data = GetData(); data2 = GetData2(); i want it wait untill GetData return and only then continue, how dod i do it ?
[10:48:40] <petey> is this something you would normally make global?
[10:48:49] <jphase> personally, yes
[10:48:50] <petey> or would I wrap it in a larger function? I don't want to mess around with global variables
[10:49:04] <jphase> I would just say var data = false; at the top of this closure
[10:49:17] <jphase> then you can set data on the done
[10:49:50] <jphase> Tomashe: sounds like a job for promises
[10:50:03] <Tomashe> ok
[10:51:00] <jphase> petey: alternatively you can put your getJSON call inside a function, call the function from the click event, and also on load
[10:51:17] <petey> jphase: http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/1/edit
[10:51:37] <c0derg1rl> If I have a form <form class="my-form" data-action="form-submit"> and a jQuery(document).on('submit', '.my-form', my_dispatcher ); how would I get the data('action') in the my_dispatcher function?
[10:52:44] <duch_kazatel> $(this).data('action')
[10:54:49] <ankurk_> Anyone having an example of multiple select filters on a table?
[10:55:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I load certain content with the load() method from jquery. However, when I try to attach an event handler on those, it doesn't work. Any idea why not?
[10:56:02] <jphase> petey: is there any reason why you have getData in a closure? have you thought about something like: http://paste.ofcode.org/WxC2UJDdXSw4KMBiucDRBB
[10:58:06] <Tomashe> GetUserChat(id,type).promise().done(function(data) {}); will that work , sinec GetUserChat return data
[11:00:14] <petey> i was going for IIFE
[11:00:27] <petey> but i think that has to be anonymous, lol :(
[11:02:06] <petey> brb jphase
[11:02:27] <petey> but yeah the only reason I did that was because I was reading about IIFE
[11:06:01] <c0derg1rl> duch_kazatel: thank you.
[11:07:24] <duch_kazatel> word
[11:12:35] <fons1> Hello. I'm currently working on a site using the Bootstrap framework w/ Scrollspy. Scrollspy sets the active link in the nav as you scroll through the page. I currently have one of the links to set off a Modal but for some reason it automatically marks the Modal link with the class of "active". How would I go about editing the Scrollspy code so it doesn't target any links within the nav with
[11:12:35] <fons1> the attribute data-toggle="modal". Bootply code here: http://www.bootply.com/117358
[11:12:54] <duch_kazatel> fons1 don't modify the library
[11:13:05] <duch_kazatel> that's a terrible idea.
[11:13:06] <fons1> I know this is the piece of the code which marks it with an active class: d.parent(".dropdown-menu").length && (d = d.closest("li.dropdown").addClass("active")), d.trigger("activate"). How would I edit that line so it doesnt target anything with the attribute data-toggle="modal".
[11:13:14] <fons1> Well...how else would I fix it.
[11:13:50] <duch_kazatel> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#scrollspy
[11:13:53] <duch_kazatel> use it differently.
[11:14:10] <duch_kazatel> or hook into the "activate" event and go from there.
[11:14:29] <fons1> I would but....the bootstrap code I was given was minified and I dont have the production version.
[11:14:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:15:02] <duch_kazatel> why do you care about the bootstrap code?  what about the custom js on your side?
[11:15:08] <duch_kazatel> not the stuff inside of bootstrap.
[11:15:08] <fons1> I dont know what to remove in my minified version of bootstrap.js to remove scrollspy to run independetly.
[11:15:23] <fons1> scrollspy is within my bootstrap.min.js
[11:15:36] <duch_kazatel> fons1 that's exactly not the thing you want to edit.
[11:15:40] <duch_kazatel> do not edit the library.
[11:15:45] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/3xL49/
[11:15:51] <Tomashe> why this isnt alerting me "1"
[11:16:21] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe open yer console
[11:16:35] <fons1> @duch - What do I edit?...
[11:16:43] <duch_kazatel> fons1 your site's code.
[11:16:43] <Tomashe> i dont get it
[11:16:51] <duch_kazatel> your html or javascript.
[11:16:54] <duch_kazatel> not the library
[11:17:09] <Tomashe> Object 1 has no method 'promise
[11:17:16] <Tomashe> what is that means exactly?
[11:17:22] <fons1> I've tried editing the HTML and not setting it as an a href but thats not what I want.
[11:17:32] <fons1> since I would like to keep it as a link
[11:17:43] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe the object you're running that method on doesn't have that method.
[11:17:50] <duch_kazatel> fons1 can you share your code in a fiddle?
[11:18:01] <fons1> sure. give me a sec.
[11:18:02] <duch_kazatel> fons1 also what's your comfort level with javascript/jquery
[11:18:55] <Tomashe> can u show me an example how that should be fixed duch?
[11:19:07] <fons1> noob.
[11:19:56] <jphase> speaking of objects that don't have methods available... is the "right" way to check for that a try/catch ?  seems funny looking
[11:20:12] <jphase> but definitely effective :\
[11:21:03] <duch_kazatel> are you simply testing?
[11:21:16] <duch_kazatel> because if so, test against undefined.
[11:21:25] <duch_kazatel> one of the few cases i bless == over ===
[11:21:30] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:22:17] <petey> jphase: I see what you've done here, but it's just reloading the same data
[11:22:26] <petey> I would like to append the new data to the array
[11:22:39] <petey> so if I start with [0,1], I want to load [2], [3], [4], etc
[11:23:13] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/1/edit
[11:23:31] <MikeD_> how do i add text to a textarea?
[11:24:02] <ankurk_> MikeD_: $(textarea).val("text");
[11:24:05] <jphase> MikeD_: .val works for all form elements
[11:24:27] <duch_kazatel> back
[11:24:37] <MikeD_> cool, thanks
[11:24:49] <jphase> petey: hmm, I guess I'm not quite familiar with the response from the flickr api, can you just check to see if the src is already in your array before adding it?
[11:25:28] <petey> the problem is data is not defined when you try pushing it
[11:25:42] <petey> I don't know how to give pushData the actual data
[11:25:46] <petey> so it can manipulate it
[11:26:04] <petey> how would you add/remove images from this is what I'm asking I guess
[11:26:36] <jphase> petey: well you can remove data from your object with "delete"
[11:26:55] <jphase> or remove objects from the array
[11:27:04] <duch_kazatel> using slice()
[11:27:21] <jphase> ^
[11:28:24] <jphase> duch_kazatel: you were saying you prefer using == over === in the case I mentioned above?
[11:28:37] <duch_kazatel> that's one of the few times I'm cool with it, at least.
[11:28:48] <jphase> gotcha, thx m8
[11:28:52] <duch_kazatel> if (myThing != 'undefined')
[11:28:52] <petey> how would you add items?
[11:28:55] <petey> That's my problem
[11:28:57] <duch_kazatel> .push
[11:29:09] <petey> if I can figure out how to pass the data into the pushData function I will be able to edit the amount that I'm splicing
[11:29:11] <duch_kazatel> array.push() adds a new object to the array.
[11:29:11] <petey> so I just splice less
[11:29:15] <petey> or I can push as well
[11:29:28] <petey> http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/1/edit, duch_kazatel what would you do in this scenario?
[11:29:49] <petey> I am loading in data, I want 2 images to load from the start, once you click "click me" I want to push new images from the array
[11:30:05] <petey> my problem right now is that data.items.splice(0,i) returns undefined because I have no idea how to pass in the addImage data
[11:30:20] <petey> I think I need to use a better javascript pattern, or do this inside of an object?
[11:30:43] <duch_kazatel> I'd use .on('click', function(){}); because i'm idomatic as fuck.
[11:31:13] <petey> Ok I will change that
[11:31:32] <petey> what about pushing new objects from the data array?
[11:31:33] <duch_kazatel> you could do something like this: http://jsbin.com/zafukaro/5/edit
[11:31:48] <duch_kazatel> then myData points to the loaded data everywhere, but that can be a terrible idea depending.
[11:33:40] <petey> I see
[11:33:57] <fons1> @duch - for some reason i cant get it to work in jfiddle. Only bootply
[11:34:12] <duch_kazatel> fons1 link what you've got so far.
[11:37:22] <fons1> @duch - http://jsfiddle.net/u6vWL/17/
[11:37:37] <fons1> It doesn't mark the links as active via scrollspy.
[11:37:52] <fons1> but it's in the bootstrap.js...scrollspy
[11:38:04] <duch_kazatel> and again, do NOT edit the library.
[11:38:10] <duch_kazatel> that is not the solution
[11:39:03] <fons1> wait. scratch that. forgot to add the body tag with the scrollspy attribute. http://jsfiddle.net/u6vWL/21/
[11:39:09] <fons1> new link.
[11:39:33] <fons1> This guy with the same issue...but on an older version.
[11:39:34] <fons1> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/2212
[11:39:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/u6vWL/22/
[11:39:48] <duch_kazatel> I fixed some things.
[11:39:57] <ragas_> ive been pulling from a restful api server, but posting is giving me '400 bad request': $.ajax({   type: "POST",   url: "the-url",   data:formData,   dataType: "json", });  when i change data type to jsonp , i dont get the error, but im prompted for authentication, which i dont think i should need, since the url has some keys encoded in it.
[11:40:46] <duch_kazatel> fons1 right - because you shouldn't edit the plugin ;)
[11:41:44] <duch_kazatel> fons1 you might need to hook into this: $('#myScrollspy').on('activate.bs.scrollspy', function () {
[11:41:59] <duch_kazatel> and cancel the magic if it matches your criteria
[11:42:48] <fons1> Ah ha. I'll give it a shot.
[11:42:59] <fons1> do you have a link to the reference you posted?
[11:43:16] <duch_kazatel> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
[11:46:16] <fons1> So from that function would I be targeting the link with the data-toggle="modal" and removing the active class on the li?
[11:47:21] <duch_kazatel> well, no, because that still doesn't make much sense - you won't have any "active" tabs at that point.  If I were you, I've move the thing that launches to model to outside of the navigation.
[11:47:41] <BillCriswell> I keep testing on a big touch screen and coming back to my laptop and pushing the screen like an idiot.
[11:49:53] <decx> i have an easy solution for you
[11:49:58] <decx> we're gonna cut off your hands
[11:50:09] <BillCriswell> decx: I like these things though.
[11:50:25] <decx> nevermind i'm just into good news bad news at the moment
[11:50:28] <jphase> they've very "handy" for "me time"
[11:50:35] <decx> you've got the body of someone half your age
[11:50:39] <decx> growing inside your womb
[11:51:00] <fons1> But I do have an active tab on the modal link automatically on load.
[11:51:36] <fons1> But you kind of lost me with your approach on moving the launch model.
[11:52:06] <duch_kazatel> fons1 the a tag that launches the modal - does that really semantically belong in the navigation for the site?
[11:52:51] <fons1> Yes. It loads an iFrame with an external sign up page.
[11:53:22] <duch_kazatel> my solution would be to move that out of the nav markup and separate it that way.
[11:53:23] <duch_kazatel> problem solved.
[11:54:53] <fons1> Touche. I didn't want to go that route because I wanted to keep styling the same as the other nav items, except for the active styling.
[11:55:06] <duch_kazatel> it'd argue that it's not really nav styling though
[11:56:33] <fons1> Oh. The JFiddle doesnt have the styling of the site...but I'll go that route.
[11:56:41] <fons1> thanks duch for the help!
[12:01:35] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/3xL49/1/ < whats wrong here now
[12:01:37] <Tomashe> seriously
[12:08:50] <BillCriswell> Tomashe: What's your goal?
[12:11:30] <simpleuser> Hi there. I'm looking for a jquery Bash highlighter (it can also highlight other languages, I don't care). But I'd like a highlighter with word wrap... Would you know one like that?
[12:11:45] <simpleuser> Found this one http://prismjs.com/ but seems to be no word wrap
[12:13:38] <BillCriswell> simpleuser: Can you just change the CSS to allow word wrapping?
[12:13:47] <BillCriswell> Well, force it to wrap.
[12:13:51] <simpleuser> BillCriswell, don't know
[12:13:55] <simpleuser> how?
[12:13:56] <simpleuser> :D
[12:13:59] <simpleuser> (noob here)
[12:14:02] <decx> i used this one http://craig.is/making/rainbows
[12:14:36] <BillCriswell> decx: I felt like I was being assaulted by a rainbow as I scrolled through that page.
[12:14:44] <simpleuser> haha
[12:14:48] <BillCriswell> simpleuser: css white-space property.
[12:15:01] <simpleuser> thanks BillCriswell  !
[12:15:06] <decx> well craig IS making rainbows, so, that is to be expected
[12:15:25] <decx> i forgot, does irc have italics?
[12:15:33] <decx> 	test
[12:15:36] <decx> hehe
[12:15:52] <ragas_> is "{key:"value"} 'stringified?'
[12:16:10] <decx> everything in js is stringified isnt it
[12:16:42] <ankurk_> decx: Only if the object is a string no?
[12:18:12] <ragas_> the api says to send the data 'stringified' . so i want to make sure.
[12:22:30] <ragas_> text edit turns my normal quote characters into those curvy, code unfriendly 'pretty' quotes, even though its in plain text mode.  wtf, grrrr.
[12:23:26] <jphase> ew, I hate those
[12:23:34] <jphase> all microsofty
[12:24:15] <bl> is there a function like toggle that allows us to switch between to different values, instead of just on/off like toggle?
[12:25:01] <bl> pretty plox
[12:27:47] <Tomashe> hey guys , i got on("pageshow" on jqueyr mobile. is that means that everytime the page should that loads (even multiple times) or only once?
[12:28:51] <cprodigy29> for jQuery mobile is there a fix to stop the buttons from flickering a different color when you use div data-role="footer" data-id="foo1" data-position="fixed?
[12:29:46] <jphase> Tomashe: that event is deprecated btw, but it will be triggered after the "toPage" transition animation has completed
[12:30:22] <jphase> (should be using "pagecontainershow" instead)
[12:32:06] <cprodigy29> I guess I could disable the transitions
[12:32:17] <dopie> hey guys
[12:32:19] <cprodigy29> thats the only time it does it
[12:32:22] <dopie> how do i refactor ths
[12:32:23] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/9258919
[12:35:54] <duch_kazatel> dopie easy.
[12:36:14] <dopie> duch_kazatel, how?
[12:36:29] <duch_kazatel> first of all, you know you only need one doc ready, right?
[12:37:20] <duch_kazatel> second of all, are you familiar with how css selectors work?
[12:37:28] <Tomashe> duch what was your yesterday for createing new object instead of value = new Object();
[12:37:42] <duch_kazatel> value = {}
[12:37:45] <duch_kazatel> object literal.
[12:37:52] <duch_kazatel> use value = [] for arrays.,
[12:38:09] <jphase> ^ my favorite part about js btw
[12:38:27] <duch_kazatel> that you don't have to use constructors all the time?
[12:38:27] <duch_kazatel> because that's awesome.
[12:38:33] <jphase> indeed
[12:38:36] <duch_kazatel> if what you're doing looks weird, it probably is.
[12:39:00] <duch_kazatel> dopie see my questions above?
[12:39:32] <Tomashe> thanks
[12:39:49] <dopie> yes i did
[12:39:57] <dopie> didnt really understand it
[12:39:57] <dopie> :)
[12:42:18] <duch_kazatel> dopie http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/
[12:42:31] <duch_kazatel> first of all, only wrap your shit in one document ready where you can.
[12:42:52] <duch_kazatel> or be cool and do this: http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/2/
[12:42:55] <dopie> k cuz i have a bunch of document reads
[12:42:56] <dopie> :)
[12:43:03] <duch_kazatel> you only need to bind to that once.
[12:43:10] <duch_kazatel> second of all - CSS selectors.  you can group them.
[12:43:19] <duch_kazatel> like I did in the fiddle.
[12:43:23] <dopie> ahh col
[12:43:29] <dopie> ok i wasnt sure
[12:43:36] <duch_kazatel> do you use CSS?
[12:44:08] <duch_kazatel> also:  $(".main-page").removeClass(".no-fade"); - this won't work
[12:44:16] <duch_kazatel>  $(".main-page").removeClass("no-fade"); is what you want.
[12:47:24] <dopie> duch_kazatel,
[12:47:27] <dopie> ok i see
[12:47:37] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/3/
[12:47:48] <dopie> how do i consolidate all the document ready ???
[12:48:48] <duch_kazatel> easy - remove all of them and then wrap the outside of everything with one.  let me demonstrate.
[12:48:57] <duch_kazatel> I'
[12:49:04] <duch_kazatel> *also - i'll show you a few other things you can change.
[12:50:04] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/4/
[12:50:23] <duch_kazatel> so that's the single doc ready you need.
[12:50:24] <duch_kazatel> but you're doing some expensive operations in there.
[12:51:20] <duch_kazatel> you've got three scroll event handlers.
[12:51:20] <duch_kazatel> and on each of those, you're running .each()
[12:51:20] <duch_kazatel> scroll checks can be slow, as can each.
[12:52:00] <dopie> duch_kazatel, clients love it
[12:52:01] <dopie> :)
[12:52:07] <duch_kazatel> if looks like you're checking to see if something is in the viewport and, if so, fade it in?
[12:52:15] <dopie> yeah
[12:52:17] <duch_kazatel> dopie you're writing horribly inefficient code.
[12:52:49] <dopie> duch_kazatel,  i know,  am extremely new
[12:52:50] <dopie> :)
[12:53:19] <ankurk_> Can anyone help me with this? https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/94c21daf505ea556fafb
[12:53:57] <dopie> duch_kazatel, is there more effiecient code?? for what i want to do??
[12:54:14] <krambiorix> hi, using autocomplete i sometimes see that when opening the dropdown list , the list is scrolled already... How can i disable that?
[12:54:20] <duch_kazatel> dopie first of all, combine all of that -> http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/5/
[12:54:42] <decx> here's a neat little above fold selector expression: $.extend( $.expr[':'], { 'above-fold': function (el) { var $w = $(window), viewArea = $w.scrollTop() + $w.height(), $el = $(el); return viewArea >= $el.offset().top; } });
[12:54:46] <duch_kazatel> dopie for even more efficiency, cache $('.hideme, .work-text, .work-project-info') for you.
[12:54:52] <petey> http://jsbin.com/ragefore/1/edit
[12:54:56] <decx> can be used like this: $('.myclass:above-fold')
[12:54:59] <DarkGhost> hello everyone, I'm using .load("localfile.html") btu I have some code to check an onclick that is on the localfile but it isn't working, should I put the onclick code inside the localfile.html ?
[12:55:02] <petey> Why can't I return the data for getJson?
[12:55:15] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost is localfile.html on your hard drive?
[12:55:20] <DarkGhost> yes
[12:55:29] <duch_kazatel> are you running everything through a webserver?
[12:55:43] <DarkGhost> idk what you're getting at.. the localfile.html is on the same server as the site
[12:55:46] <DarkGhost> its just loading from another html file
[12:56:19] <dopie> duch_kazatel,  sweet
[12:56:21] <duch_kazatel> you cannot randomly load files off a hard drive unless you're running through a server of some kind.
[12:56:22] <dopie> wow
[12:56:34] <duch_kazatel> dopie look at what decx posted, too.
[12:57:47] <DarkGhost> duch_kazatel it's loading the file
[12:58:01] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost through a webserver or off your local hard drive?
[12:58:08] <DarkGhost> lol the loading part is working
[12:58:09] <dopie> decx, hey can u gist that
[12:58:21] <DarkGhost> its the jquery that is looking for an input box, inside the laoded file, that is not working
[12:58:33] <duch_kazatel> DarkGhost ah, i get it.  use event delegation.
[12:58:40] <DarkGhost> thank you!! jeeze
[12:58:40] <DarkGhost> lol
[12:58:44] <DarkGhost> okay, let me look hat up
[12:58:49] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function(){});
[12:59:04] <duch_kazatel> where parent is an element that exists on pageload and 'child' is the element you want to trigger of.
[12:59:08] <duch_kazatel> *on
[12:59:17] <duch_kazatel> 'event' would be the name of the event.
[12:59:57] <DarkGhost> so parent would be something that's getting loaded from loadthis, and event would be click, and what would child be? like the selector? "input"
[13:00:12] <duch_kazatel> the parent would be something that's all ready on the page.
[13:00:15] <duch_kazatel> before the load happens.
[13:00:23] <duch_kazatel> that's a parent of the container your content is in.
[13:01:14] <DarkGhost> gotcha
[13:01:22] <DarkGhost> and event woudl be click, and child would be the selector im looking for ?
[13:01:56] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[13:02:03] <duch_kazatel> without seeing code, probably.
[13:02:14] <duch_kazatel> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/9/
[13:02:21] <duch_kazatel> here's a little more optimisation.
[13:02:26] <DarkGhost> cool thank you duch_kazatel
[13:02:51] <duch_kazatel> even further - http://jsfiddle.net/wyp3w/10/
[13:05:34] <dopie> wow
[13:05:42] <dopie> im like super impressed duch_kazatel
[13:05:42] <dopie> :)
[13:06:32] <duch_kazatel> nah, don't be.  you could still make that better.  figuring out a way to NOT calculate all that stuff over and over would be a big help.
[13:06:40] <duch_kazatel> but caching is usually a good plan.
[13:06:46] <decx> dopie http://jsfiddle.net/decx/kyzr7/ here's an example use
[13:08:48] <dopie> decx,  youre using stuff i havent even seen before
[13:08:49] <dopie> :)
[13:09:11] <decx> well #jquery to the rescue then !
[13:10:03] <ankurk_> Please rescue me too :P
[13:10:11] <joevandyk> i have an input field that has a blur event handler. that event handler causes another event to happen. but if i'm focused on the input field and then click a link, it the onblur event happens, but the link doesn't get clicked. ideas why?
[13:10:13] <dopie> decx, and duch_kazatel  thank you :)
[13:10:29] <duch_kazatel> dopie fshure.
[13:10:35] <duch_kazatel> 'swhat we do here in #jquery
[13:10:39] <dopie> joevandyk, jsfiddle it
[13:10:40] <dopie> :)
[13:15:05] <joevandyk> dopie: http://jsfiddle.net/hvwXX/
[13:15:10] <joevandyk> click the input, then click the link
[13:15:19] <joevandyk> i want the link to be able to be clicked
[13:15:39] <duch_kazatel> joevandyk first off - dont use bind.
[13:15:39] <duch_kazatel> use on.
[13:15:51] <duch_kazatel> second - works for me.
[13:15:57] <joevandyk> duch_kazatel: you see 'clicked'?
[13:16:11] <duch_kazatel> aaah, that's your issue.
[13:16:52] <duch_kazatel> i don't think you can alert twice like that.
[13:17:18] <joevandyk> actual code isn't doing an alert, it's just doing something that emits an event, i'll see if i can replicate
[13:17:26] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/hvwXX/1/
[13:17:28] <Erryl> I created a custom download file for the menu widget, but know I'm kinda stuck because I don't know how to add it
[13:17:30] <duch_kazatel> works firne here.
[13:17:40] <duch_kazatel> *fine
[13:18:53] <joevandyk> duch_kazatel: console.log doesn't emit an event?
[13:19:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:19:06] <duch_kazatel> no...?
[13:19:10] <duch_kazatel> it's logs things out.
[13:19:14] <duch_kazatel> *it logs
[13:19:25] <duch_kazatel> window.alert() blocks things from executing
[13:19:30] <duch_kazatel> use console.log() instead.
[13:20:50] <Erryl> I extrected the file now, so I have a map now containing the maps: 'css', 'dev-bundle' and 'js' and a html index file
[13:22:07] <duch_kazatel> Erryl from where?
[13:22:18] <duch_kazatel> and "map"?
[13:22:32] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: The download builder from the jquiery ui site
[13:23:30] <duch_kazatel> you reference the js and css on your page.
[13:24:15] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: So I should upload them to the ftp server where my html page is on too?
[13:24:47] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Or are the references in that index file enough
[13:24:49] <duch_kazatel> i would assume.  and then edit your html file(s) to reference things as appropriate.
[13:25:15] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I see, I'll try that, thanks
[13:28:17] <tudda> just a tip... if you are going to use console.log, do if(console) console.log otherwise youll get some errors
[13:28:25] <duch_kazatel> tudda huh?
[13:28:40] <duch_kazatel> tudda you should never leave console.log() in production code, so that shouldn't be necessary.
[13:29:10] <tudda> Fair enough.  Just a habit.
[13:29:32] <duch_kazatel> also: console.log is widely supported all the way back to, what, IE7?  it only breaks when you don't have the console open.
[13:30:14] <tudda> yeah, but  I've had scenarios on a test server with people reviewing it and getting errors because of it. So now it's just a habit.
[13:30:41] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  we remove all testing code like that from stuff before pushing it up to our testing/staging boxes.
[13:31:36] <tudda> Youve never had a scenario where you weren't having an issue locally/dev but you were in a test environment on certain machines/environments, and wanted to see debug info?
[13:31:55] <duch_kazatel> that's why i use a debugger.
[13:33:14] <duch_kazatel> plus, for code to make it to any of those environments, it has to get peer reviewed at my place.  that means things like that get caught and deleted.
[13:33:23] <duch_kazatel> or rather, shipped back to the dev to be deleted.
[13:33:25] <tudda> To each their own. :)
[13:33:40] <duch_kazatel> here we have to be careful: PCI is a thing.
[13:35:05] <duch_kazatel> we also use vagrant here, so every developer is running almost the exact same configuration as our liveservers.
[13:35:19] <duch_kazatel> proc speed and ram size are the only differences as far as the machine can tell.
[13:39:40] <duch_kazatel> god i hate coldfusion.  the docs for cfscript says this: "Use curly braces to group multiple statements together into one logical statement unit. "
[13:39:47] <duch_kazatel> i mean, what?
[13:39:57] <tudda> I've spent most of my time writing straight c#/integrations/etc so I'm just getting my feet wet with all the client side stuff.
[13:40:13] <tudda> I'll give vagrant a look, sounds interesting.
[13:41:02] <duch_kazatel> it's really just a simple way to provision a VM inside your box.
[13:41:42] <duch_kazatel> what makes it great though is it makes things nice and simple.  Hired a new dev?  Get them repo access, have them download it, get vagrant installed, provision, done.
[13:42:37] <duch_kazatel> and because you can basically run your prod environment locally, you spot issues a little sooner.
[13:45:06] <kaylors> Okay, so often, when a new element is inserted, the element under it gets pushed down. How do I smoothen this? Instead of the elements moving down abruptly, I want them to slide down.
[13:46:39] <Erryl> I have this in my code, but the alert message doesn't show up. The javascript code is in the jsfeatures.js file. When I only use the alert it works though
[13:46:46] <Erryl> http://jsfiddle.net/XgLPL/
[13:46:52] <tudda> I feel like thatwould be awesome  with server side stuff, but notall that mch with client issues/jquery, but can't say i have enough experience in the area to say with any confidence
[13:49:11] <Erryl> And the code in my jquery.js is just the compressed version from the website
[13:49:37] <duch_kazatel> Erryl are you getting any console errors?
[13:49:59] <jammsen> im doing an interval post with jquery, sometimes my session runs out and i get a "NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://hostname.com", is it possible to get the status code in my $.post function?
[13:50:23] <duch_kazatel> tudda it's still awesome because now we're all on the same plaftorm
[13:50:24] <jammsen> i want to redirect the user to the login formular
[13:50:27] <duch_kazatel> *platform
[13:50:32] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: How can I see that? Because I only checked if I saw the alert on my site
[13:50:42] <duch_kazatel> Erryl what browser/os?
[13:50:52] <Erryl> Opere/ windows 7
[13:50:55] <Erryl> Opera*
[13:50:59] <krambiorix> hi, using autocomplete i sometimes see that when opening the dropdown list , the list is scrolled already... How can i disable that?
[13:51:44] <duch_kazatel> woah.  not sure how to check in opera, erryl
[13:52:02] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I have chrome too, if you know it there?
[13:52:16] <duch_kazatel> I do - f12 on the keyboard
[13:56:28] <Erryl> dutch_kazatel: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string jquery.js:2 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[13:56:32] <jangoh> FB API is not working for subdomain but works for main domain , added subdomain in 'domain' anyone have experience with this?
[13:56:41] <Erryl> dutch_kazatel: Those are the console errors
[13:57:04] <duch_kazatel> Erryl sounds like you don't have jquery included.
[13:57:32] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you included jquery UI and some other stuff, but no jquery.
[13:58:40] <offlim> Does anyone know how i can get the height of the inside of a iframe? The iframe is loading up a page on another domain
[13:59:04] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Well I included it with <script src="jquery.js"></script>
[13:59:34] <duch_kazatel> Erryl and that's jquery itself?
[13:59:45] <duch_kazatel> because that error tells me its not.
[14:00:06] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: There is http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js in it
[14:00:25] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Or is that not the correct thing
[14:00:35] <duch_kazatel> Erryl and you've got everything inside of an actual document, right?
[14:00:41] <duch_kazatel> like, a full pagE?
[14:01:13] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I just copy pasted all of the code in the link into that jquery.js file
[14:01:25] <duch_kazatel> oh and make sure you add type="text/javascrpt" to those script tags.
[14:01:41] <duch_kazatel> Erryl try linking to that file instead of your locally hosted one.
[14:02:22] <duch_kazatel> see if that makes a difference
[14:03:04] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Ok I will, btw the type must be like this, right? <script src="jquery.js"> type="text/javascrpt" </script>
[14:03:20] <duch_kazatel> ... no.
[14:03:35] <duch_kazatel>  <script type="text/javascrpt" src="jquery.js"></script>
[14:03:42] <jammsen> Question: Im doing an interval post with jquery, sometimes my session runs out and i get a "NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://hostname.com", is it possible to get the status code in my $.post function? I want to redirect the user to the login formular.
[14:03:52] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Ah wait, the '>' there was a typo
[14:05:06] <offlim> nobody knows?
[14:05:23] <duch_kazatel> offlim google it?
[14:05:28] <duch_kazatel> offlim I don't remember off the top of my head.
[14:06:19] <duch_kazatel> offlim though that's kind of shifty stuff to do - might run into problems.
[14:07:06] <offlim> i just need to grab the height of the content inside the iframe
[14:07:23] <duch_kazatel> yeah but if it's crossdomain... why are you trying to do that?
[14:08:29] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: By using the url it works, thanks again
[14:08:40] <duch_kazatel> Erryl that means your local copy is broken somehow.
[14:09:05] <Erryl> <duch_kazatel> Maybe I missed something with copy pasting, pretty sure I pressed CTRL + A though
[14:09:12] <offlim> because i have multiple domains I'm trying to show on 1 page
[14:09:14] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't do that at all.
[14:09:30] <duch_kazatel> Erryl instead you should donwload it and put it in the folder, no copy/paste
[14:09:45] <duch_kazatel> offlim that doesn't really explain much.
[14:10:02] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: I'll try that!
[14:11:21] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup, it works while having it local too now
[14:11:27] <duch_kazatel> figured.
[14:11:39] <duch_kazatel> Erryl are you new to web development?
[14:11:50] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Yup I am
[14:11:58] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Especially to JS
[14:12:07] <duch_kazatel> is it something you're playing with, or are you serious about it?
[14:12:10] <offlim> duch_kazatel: I'm remove the scroll bar. I need the iframe the same size as the page being loaded in the iframe
[14:12:18] <duch_kazatel> because if you're serious, don't use Opera.
[14:12:23] <duch_kazatel> offlim then use the iframe tag to do that.
[14:12:48] <Erryl> duch_kazatel: Ok, thanks for the tip, I figured. The f12 window is pretty cool in chrome
[14:12:53] <FrEaKmAn_> how could I see select selected by text caseinsensitive?
[14:12:56] <offlim> what tag??
[14:12:57] <FrEaKmAn_> I set*
[14:13:07] <duch_kazatel> offlim you said you're using iframes, right?
[14:13:12] <offlim> yes
[14:14:05] <kbwt> Is there a sort of "async barrier" in jQuery? i.e. I want the $.getJSON handler to run only after the JSON results are there AND the document.readyState is "complete" (i.e. "loaded" event has fired)
[14:14:38] <duch_kazatel> offlim then check out the documentation on iframes and see if that helps at all.
[14:14:44] <duch_kazatel> kbwt huh?
[14:14:47] <kbwt> I was just told .when() might do what I need
[14:14:57] <duch_kazatel> kbwt can you link to some example code.
[14:16:18] <kbwt> duch_kazatel: It's pretty much a regular $.getJSON call, but I'm measuring divs in the result handler to display the results.
[14:16:32] <duch_kazatel> kbwt that... doesn't help.
[14:16:37] <kbwt> But .width() is returning 0 when I open the page in a background tab, due to the document.readyState still being "loading"
[14:16:39] <duch_kazatel> where are you measuring the divs?  in the success callbackj?
[14:16:43] <kbwt> yep
[14:16:51] <duch_kazatel> then i need to see example code.  sorry.
[14:16:56] <duch_kazatel> otherwise i'm flying blind.
[14:17:27] <offlim> duch_kazatel: i know how to use a iframe. I'm try to set the iframe height to the same as the page be loaded with iframe... The height page being loaded will change so i can't have a set iframe height
[14:17:57] <duch_kazatel> offlim can't you set the height to a percentage of the content?  I can't remember.
[14:18:06] <offlim> no you cant
[14:18:32] <duch_kazatel> either way, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/819416/adjust-width-height-of-iframe-to-fit-with-content-in-it might help
[14:18:35] <offlim> 100% will just be the size of the browser
[14:19:09] <duch_kazatel> though i'd wonder why you're embedding multiple full pages within another page, I'm not going to worry about it.
[14:20:48] <therealklanni> BOO!
[14:43:35] <drakythe> I'm having a stupid moment and google is amplifying my stupid, I need to replace '$(document).ready($) {' with window.onload -- What is the syntax for this?
[14:44:00] <duch_kazatel> $(window).on('load', function(){}); maybe.
[14:44:10] <duch_kazatel> but don't do that unless you REALLY need to.
[14:46:27] <drakythe> duch_kazatel: My situation is this. I'm trying to do some positioning on a website with irregularly sized blocks. My issue is there is other JS on the site loading up some fonts from an outside source. My JS is firing _before_  the font JS, meaning all my calculations are way off due to the changing font size. I'm trying to finagle my to run after that stuff.
[14:47:38] <duch_kazatel> and you can't put your scripts after those?
[14:52:38] <drakythe> duch_kazatel: theoretically my script is placed after that one. I'm using Drush CMS and either it or the lag between the font js calling for its fonts and getting them is screwing me :(
[14:53:20] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[15:10:45] <Valesk> Could anyone take a look at this issue I'm having with a circular parallax effect? I have it working but it's leaving whitespace when moved too far. Here's the fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/K9Ae7/
[15:25:57] <motaka2> hello can I use data like this?                  $.data($curRec, "nrowsAdded", 2);
[15:26:08] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:26:20] <duch_kazatel> doe $curRec.data('nrowsAdded', 2)
[15:27:17] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: ?
[15:27:21] <motaka2> I dont get you
[15:27:33] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[15:28:12] <jphase> they both work
[15:28:17] <jphase> but I like duch's method better :D
[15:28:33] <motaka2> if you want to add some data to a selecyion you have to use $.data($jqDom,strVarName,{a:12,b:"string to show"})
[15:28:34] <duch_kazatel> per the docs - https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/: "
[15:28:34] <duch_kazatel> Note: This is a low-level method; a more convenient .data() is also available.
[15:28:49] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 no you don't
[15:29:13] <duch_kazatel> $jqDom.data('strVarName', {/* your object here */ })
[15:29:13] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: What don't I?
[15:29:35] <duch_kazatel> because $.data() is a low-level method that you don't need.  use my version instead.
[15:29:36] <motaka2> $.data also exists, but me too, I like your notation
[15:29:42] <duch_kazatel> they are the same, but mine reads better.
[15:29:48] <jphase> ^
[15:29:54] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: You are right
[15:30:13] <duch_kazatel> usually.
[15:30:18] <jphase> lol
[15:30:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: So the last arument doesnt need to be an object. it can be a scalar too ?
[15:30:42] <duch_kazatel> "a scalar"
[15:30:44] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:31:02] <duch_kazatel> it can be anything.  a string.  a number.  an array.  any object.
[15:31:12] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: 	$jqDom.data('strVarName',"string value"); is this right?
[15:31:30] <duch_kazatel> $yourThing.data('name', ['1', '2', 3]);
[15:31:33] <duch_kazatel> sure, you can do that,
[15:31:45] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:31:50] <decx> what are synchronized arrays called?
[15:31:52] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: ok thax. YOur notation is better I will change mine
[15:31:54] <duch_kazatel> read the docs, it tells you AND shows you.
[15:31:58] <duch_kazatel> decx whosawhats?
[15:32:03] <decx> hm mom
[15:32:05] <duch_kazatel> there are arrays and objects.
[15:32:30] <duch_kazatel> you mean an array of arrays?
[15:32:32] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9TMcR/
[15:33:17] <duch_kazatel> oh, that's just a matter of how javascript variables work.
[15:33:33] <duch_kazatel> javascript passes by reference, not value (though technically it passes by value, but the value is a reference iirc)
[15:33:34] <Shero> hey I have a var j=2; myarray = []; //then an array from python named 'array', when I do myarray.push('{{array.0.j}}');  I doesn't push it to the array, although when I do myarray.push('{{array.0.2}}'); it pushes it
[15:33:37] <decx> just thought it had a specific name
[15:34:00] <duch_kazatel> decx that i'm aware of.
[15:34:15] <decx> i wondered why my random level generator remembered the blocks i pushed into the active level array
[15:34:16] <duch_kazatel> Shero mind sharing your javascript in a jsfiddle?
[15:34:32] <jphase> nah, they just point to the same thing. if you want to "clone" an array you'd use something like var mycopy = array1.slice(0)
[15:34:35] <decx> then i remembered this but couldnt remember how it's called
[15:34:48] <decx> yeah i use that as well
[15:34:48] <duch_kazatel> decx aaaah, yeah. pass by reference
[15:35:59] <_genuser_> guys what do you think?
[15:36:18] <_genuser_> is it ok to render a <div> somewhere in teh page, and then use javascript/jquery to move it inside another div?
[15:36:40] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ why are you doing that?
[15:36:53] <_genuser_> somethign like <div>data</div>    $(jquery magic).moveThatDivInsideAnotherDIV();
[15:36:59] <duch_kazatel> why would you do that?
[15:37:10] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ it entirely depends on what you're doing.
[15:37:29] <decx> yeah you can var blah = $('mydiv'); and then append(blah)
[15:37:31] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: ok, I have "forms" I will render as part of the page. If rendered, I'll use js to then move this dom child, inside a "Ribbon" that is in the header of the page.
[15:37:35] <decx> it'll move the div
[15:37:53] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ you can just render directly to the destination.
[15:37:56] <duch_kazatel> instead of moving it.
[15:38:15] <decx> possibly the same pass by reference thing i just asked aabout and now know the name of thanks to duch_kazatel :>
[15:38:26] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[15:38:29] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: very true. however, that means that the ribbon render function will have a huge logic wheel turning to decide which page is being shown and what extras are to be shown for this page.
[15:38:47] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ without seeing your code, i have no idea what you're talking about.,
[15:38:55] <jphase> you can move it to another div if you absolutely can't modify the markup
[15:38:56] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're overcomplicating things.
[15:39:01] <jphase> _genuser_: $('div#MoveMe').appendTo($('div#targetDIV'));
[15:39:11] <_genuser_> possibly overcomplicating things.
[15:39:15] <jphase> maybe without the $() in the appendTo, can't remember
[15:39:27] <duch_kazatel> don't prepend selectors with tagnames btw.
[15:39:31] <duch_kazatel> especially ID selectors.
[15:39:41] <jphase> oh that was just for example purposes
[15:39:53] <_genuser_> example. ViewRigs page. ViewProfiles page.   both use a startdoc() which templates each page to have the same header. and a ribbon below the header. content of the ribbon depends on teh page
[15:39:58] <duch_kazatel> yeah but then people actually do that.
[15:40:28] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ then include the ribbon on each page.
[15:40:40] <jphase> _genuser_: $('thing2move').appendTo($('place2move2'));
[15:40:41] <jphase> :P
[15:40:57] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: right, so ribbon is on each page. content is page dependent.
[15:41:11] <_genuser_> jphase: right, that's what I was thinking. But I was curious if it's one of those really crazy ideas....
[15:41:14] <_genuser_> that make devs go nuts.
[15:41:32] <jphase> well that's ghetto yeah... if you have access to your markup just put it where it belongs like duch mentioned
[15:41:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah just put your shit in the right place from the beginning.
[15:42:05] <_genuser_> yeah put the $h|7 in the correct place makes sense.
[15:42:07] <jphase> I mean, if this was for like.... a tampermonkey script, then that's okay, but otherwise, no
[15:42:08] <jphase> lol
[15:42:25] <_genuser_> I figured hey jquery is fiddling crap all over the place anyway. what's one more. lol.
[15:42:31] <jphase> ick, no no
[15:42:35] <duch_kazatel> that's... terrible.
[15:42:56] <_genuser_> yeah I had a second thought while thining the original. the second saying that's probably reall dumb.
[15:44:12] <_genuser_> so ok, I'll either generate the ribbon in each page. OR decide if it's possible detect which page it is and generic crap in side the startdoc().
[15:44:49] <_genuser_> which kinda bug me to have startdoc including page view logic, but in the end might not matter much.
[15:48:22] <_genuser_> that's a lot of people leaving. I didn't think my ideas was that bad lol.
[15:48:45] <duch_kazatel> server issues
[15:49:12] <_genuser_> just thought it would sound funny. :)
[16:06:49] <Scriptonaut> could somebody explain why $("this").attr("name") doesn't work, but $("this")[0].name works?
[16:07:03] <duch_kazatel> because $("this") isn't what you want.
[16:07:06] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is.
[16:07:18] <Scriptonaut> oh I mistyped
[16:07:23] <Scriptonaut> in my program it's just $(this)
[16:07:28] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle it?
[16:07:37] <duch_kazatel> because that means $(this) is a collection.
[16:07:54] <systemfault> Because one is an attribute.. the other is a property
[16:08:32] <Scriptonaut> name is an attribute
[16:08:40] <duch_kazatel> code plox
[16:08:47] <Scriptonaut> I'm trying to figure out JSfiddle
[16:08:50] <Scriptonaut> what do I put for html
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> nothing.
[16:09:00] <duch_kazatel> just paste your js for now.
[16:09:07] <systemfault> Scriptonaut:  $("this")[0].name accesses the name property
[16:09:10] <Scriptonaut> http://jsfiddle.net/zDVma/
[16:09:17] <Scriptonaut> oh yes
[16:09:19] <systemfault> $("this").attr("name") accesses the name attribute
[16:09:25] <systemfault> Very different.
[16:09:42] <duch_kazatel> btw .bind() is a no-no.  use .on
[16:09:49] <Scriptonaut> huh?
[16:09:59] <duch_kazatel> .on('keyup'
[16:10:02] <duch_kazatel> instead of bind.
[16:10:16] <duch_kazatel> have some example html to share, too?
[16:10:26] <Scriptonaut> "object has no method 'on'
[16:10:35] <systemfault> oh god..
[16:10:42] <duch_kazatel> wat.
[16:10:42] <systemfault> What is your version of jQuery
[16:10:45] <systemfault> ?
[16:11:09] <systemfault> Probably an old crappy version..
[16:11:10] <Scriptonaut> http://jsfiddle.net/zDVma/1/
[16:11:29] <duch_kazatel> Scriptonaut what version of jquery are you using?
[16:11:32] <Scriptonaut> 1.6.1
[16:11:37] <systemfault> Yeah,that's old
[16:11:45] <systemfault> .on is 1.7 and later
[16:11:45] <Scriptonaut> damn why does jQuery have to change so fast
[16:11:55] <systemfault> We're at 1.11 now
[16:11:57] <tw2113> at least it's not 1.4.x
[16:12:04] <duch_kazatel> it doesn't change THAT fast.
[16:12:07] <systemfault> Or 1.3.2... like in some shitty WP theme
[16:12:17] <Scriptonaut> ...somebody at my work is still using 1.3.2
[16:12:25] <Scriptonaut> I see their file in one of our resource directories
[16:12:29] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[16:12:43] <duch_kazatel> you guys should have one big shared version across your project.
[16:12:49] <Scriptonaut> whoa, apparently we're using 1.3.2, 1.4.4, and 1.6.1
[16:12:59] <Scriptonaut> ya I know
[16:13:19] <Scriptonaut> dang. anyways. any ideas why attr['name'] returns nothing
[16:13:27] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you want either/...
[16:13:39] <tw2113> some of that "if it ain't broked?" mentallity, until you try to add new stuff with current code
[16:13:56] <duch_kazatel> and $(this) isn't what you think it is in that context.
[16:13:57] <Scriptonaut> I'm not sure
[16:13:59] <systemfault> Scriptonaut: What I wanted to say earlier... the equivalent of $(this)[0].name with jQuery would be $(this).prop('name')
[16:14:40] <duch_kazatel> Scriptonaut $(this) is the document in that context.  what do you want it to be?
[16:14:46] <duch_kazatel> the input?
[16:15:49] <Scriptonaut> I want $(this) to be the textarea
[16:16:00] <duch_kazatel> which one?
[16:16:11] <Scriptonaut> I want that code to be called for each one
[16:16:28] <Scriptonaut> oh, probably shoudl do .each
[16:16:38] <duch_kazatel> you're talking about your replaceWith?
[16:16:48] <duch_kazatel> just move that inside of the each you're all ready doing.
[16:17:04] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/zDVma/3/
[16:17:07] <Scriptonaut> ya that worked
[16:17:09] <Scriptonaut> thanks
[16:17:49] <Scriptonaut> I'm honestly still confused why attr['name'] doesn't work
[16:18:07] <duch_kazatel> because the square brackets are for object properties.
[16:18:18] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to get the name property of the attr object there.
[16:18:24] <duch_kazatel> attr('name') is different.
[16:18:33] <Scriptonaut> ohhh
[16:18:55] <systemfault> Scriptonaut: An attribute is what was in the HTML at the moment the document was parsed.
[16:19:04] <Scriptonaut> Ok that was a really dumb typo
[16:19:08] <systemfault> Scriptonaut: properties are actually functions/field of the DOM node
[16:19:09] <Scriptonaut> I didn't mean square brackets
[16:19:48] <duch_kazatel> attr('name') works in my example.
[16:20:01] <Scriptonaut> ya mine too
[16:20:10] <duch_kazatel> then what are you confused about?
[16:20:17] <Scriptonaut> I understand it now
[16:20:24] <Scriptonaut> I didn't mean to use square brackets
[16:20:28] <duch_kazatel> aaah
[16:20:29] <duch_kazatel> okay
[16:21:00] <_genuser_> argh web development can get really boring and monotonous sometimes.
[16:21:11] <duch_kazatel> only if you're doing it wrong :)
[16:21:17] <systemfault> _genuser_: Yes.
[16:21:27] <Scriptonaut> I'm having to do this because I need textareas that dynamically expand with their content, and IE keeps giving me compatibility troubles. Finally figured out that I can use html5 editable divs and they work the same
[16:21:34] <systemfault> Frontend is difficult.... clients are a pain... etc.
[16:21:35] <Scriptonaut> but to pass data I have to get these little hidden fields
[16:21:37] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: well the repetitive stuff. the thinking it thru and laying it out.
[16:22:03] <duch_kazatel> systemfault only if you do 3rd party :)
[16:22:06] <duch_kazatel> we're in-house for dev.
[16:22:15] <systemfault> Oh :)
[16:22:19] <_genuser_> mostly because I always take a long time to design my UI. I play with stuff until I like the spacing, the colors, the animations, etc.
[16:22:34] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ ah yeah i let my designers deal with that shit.
[16:22:39] <duch_kazatel> i just implement and javascript all day/
[16:22:41] <_genuser_> and that means chaning one line in the code refreshing, stylesheet, refresh.
[16:22:53] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: oh yeah, that would be breezy and lightweight.
[16:22:57] <duch_kazatel> please tell me you're using firebug.
[16:23:00] <duch_kazatel> or dev tools
[16:23:15] <systemfault> duch_kazatel: He uses Frontpage
[16:23:19] <systemfault> j/k
[16:23:22] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I'm my user. so I have to code so it's usable by me and useful for me.
[16:23:34] <_genuser_> frontpage? no that's only if you want to add tons of html junk.
[16:23:44] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ but are you using something like firebbug or chrome's dev tools?
[16:23:47] <_genuser_> I uses a previously unsung hero of the development world.
[16:23:50] <duch_kazatel> you know you can "live edit" shit with those.
[16:23:58] <_genuser_> I usez notepad!!!! dum dum duuuuuuuuuuuum.
[16:24:21] <duch_kazatel> firebug is apart of the browser.  same with chrome's dev tools.
[16:24:24] <duch_kazatel> use them.
[16:24:36] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: maybe I should download or look into the firebug / chrome dev tools.
[16:24:40] <tw2113> firebug is not a part of Firefox
[16:24:50] <duch_kazatel> no, but it's a plugin.
[16:24:52] <tw2113> firebug is a 3rd party addon
[16:25:03] <duch_kazatel> i know - I use it daily.
[16:25:06] <tw2113> and Firefox has their own native tools these days that do just as well imho
[16:25:13] <duch_kazatel> until they crash
[16:25:23] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: I don't do web primarily. so now and then I need to whip up something and notepad does the trick. but for something like this where it's a complete app, a tool would be nice.
[16:25:26] <duch_kazatel> _genuser_ if you have chome and are on windows, hit f12 and have your mind blown.
[16:25:41] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: hmmmm I have hit f12 and used it for debugging.
[16:25:54] <duch_kazatel> you're aware of the element inspector stuff, right?
[16:26:09] <_genuser_> yeah, I used it to debug quite a few stylesheet things, etc.
[16:26:27] <duch_kazatel> okay, good.  use those with notepad instead of editing and refreshing all the time.
[16:27:53] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: for style changes, but what about layout editting.
[16:28:02] <duch_kazatel> you can move divs and stuff.
[16:28:04] <duch_kazatel> click and drag.
[16:28:10] <duch_kazatel> you can also edit.
[16:28:14] <_genuser_> hmmm nice.
[16:28:17] <_genuser_> let me play with this more.
[16:29:48] <_genuser_> duch_kazatel: hmmm it's encapsulating some of my stuff in <a> </a> tags where I have none in the html file.
[16:29:55] <_genuser_> in the elements viewer
[16:31:09] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you've got invalid markup that the rendering engine is cleaning up.
[16:31:40] <_genuser_> time for using a validator then.
[16:31:40] <_genuser_> find the crap and delete it.
[16:31:55] <duch_kazatel> what sorts of things is it doing that with?
[16:32:27] <_genuser_> <div 1></div>  <div2></div>       and it's showing it as    <a><div2></div></a>
[16:32:49] <duch_kazatel> wait you're not actually calling it <div 1> right?
[16:32:51] <_genuser_> so two of them side by side in teh code. and one of them is encapsulated inside an <a> tag
[16:33:01] <_genuser_> no no not calling it <div 1> lol.
[16:33:08] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[16:33:18] <_genuser_> <div id=1></div>   <div id=2></div>
[16:33:23] <_genuser_> yes I'm using "" around id=.
[16:33:26] <duch_kazatel> that sounds wrong
[16:33:30] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle?
[16:33:36] <duch_kazatel> it shouldn't render out that way.
[16:34:01] <_genuser_> very possible I'm missing tags. hand rolling a page a mile wide is bound to have room for dev error.
[16:34:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah then validate
[16:35:30] <_genuser_> righty on to the validator, lol.
[16:36:37] <_genuser_> 72 ERRORS 40 WARNINGS.
[16:37:50] <_genuser_> uhoh, it's forcing me to move to html5
[16:38:26] <tw2113> good validator
[16:38:41] <duch_kazatel> do it
[16:38:48] <_genuser_> type="text/javascript"   whaaannn.
[16:39:01] <_genuser_> that will take forever to add to all <Script> tags.
[16:39:01] <_genuser_> lol
[16:39:47] <duch_kazatel> that;'s valid.
[16:45:03] <duch_kazatel> and use html5.
[16:45:03] <duch_kazatel> it's good times.
[16:45:05] <_genuser_> <!doctype html> from 72 errors down to 44.
[16:45:05] <_genuser_> woo!!
[16:45:05] <_genuser_> it was counting my <link  />   the / as an error and telling me to move to html5.
[16:45:05] <_genuser_> apparently html 4.01 strict wasn't big on self closing tags.
[16:55:09] <_genuser_> lol Stray start tag div.
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> nice
[16:55:51] <davearel_> https://gist.github.com/tbranyen/9255362
[16:57:45] <duch_kazatel> what about it, davearel_?
[16:58:00] <davearel_> duch_kazatel: jump in if you have an opinion
[16:58:06] <duch_kazatel> ah,
[16:58:13] <davearel_> It's regarding AMD in jQuery
[16:58:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah i was reading it.
[16:58:39] <davearel_> Did you read this? https://tech.bellycard.com/blog/the-future-of-jquery/
[16:59:23] <duch_kazatel> ooh, no I didn't.  let me poke it :)
[17:00:58] <duch_kazatel> i 100% agree with the dependency management direction, btw.
[17:01:25] <davearel_> duch_kazatel: awesome! good to hear
[17:02:29] <duch_kazatel> honestly the only three complaints i've ever had is 1) inclusion of things i don't need/care about, 2) a little more woo and magic than I like sometimes (though it's necessary), 3) it doesn't interface with my coffeemaker.
[17:02:48] <davearel_> haha
[17:04:12] <duch_kazatel> oooh, the lack of a global object is a novel concept.
[17:04:28] <davearel_> Yep
[17:44:42] <cprodigy29> I have this code that plays songs from a playlist to an html 5 audio player. Any idea on how i could handle the controls for pause for each song? http://pastie.org/8810694
[17:49:19] <cprodigy29> i got the pause and play working now to figure how to attach it to each track
[18:19:29] <_josh> I'm getting a weird exception whenever I try to bind to a Spine object, "Cannot call method 'push' of undefined"; anybody know what this is about?
[18:59:35] <jphase> _josh: don't really know what a spine object is, but whatever file is throwing that error is trying to add items to to something that isn't an array
[18:59:53] <_josh> yeah, I think I figured out that it's some bug with the library i'm using
[19:15:52] <drewdrewdrew> hey anyone good with regular expressions and want to chat for a sec?
[19:21:56] <zumba_addict> hey folks, how do I modify this so I don't connect to the third party link? https://github.com/dansingerman/jQuery-Browser-Language/blob/master/jquery.browserLanguage.js
[19:27:10] <scarmichael1> how would one go about stopping and starting this slideshow function http://pastebin.com/NyEHXSJ4 ?
[19:31:12] <zumba_addict> anyone please?
[19:36:09] <jphase> zumba_addict: you can do something like -  var myinterval = setInterval(function, 500);  and then later do  clearInterval(myinterval);
[19:36:26] <zumba_addict> that's not for me :)
[19:36:32] <jphase> whoops
[19:36:34] <jphase> sorry lol
[19:36:34] <zumba_addict> mine is the language detection
[19:36:38] <zumba_addict> it's ok
[19:36:45] <jphase> scarmichael1:  you can do something like -  var myinterval = setInterval(function, 500);  and then later do  clearInterval(myinterval);
[19:38:03] <scarmichael1> jphase: thanks so much
[19:38:09] <scarmichael1> i'm very new to jquery
[19:41:10] <jphase> zumba_addict: you'd have to make a server-side script that generates similar headers based on the geo location of the user
[19:41:28] <zumba_addict> yes, that's what I thought too
[19:41:45] <zumba_addict> looks like we don't have php installed on the server
[19:41:54] <zumba_addict> using php, I can pull it with _SERVER["HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE"]
[19:42:07] <zumba_addict> because I tried it on my laptop apache
[19:42:16] <jphase> yeah, any server-side language should do
[19:42:51] <zumba_addict> don't know what other languages are install on our server
[19:42:58] <zumba_addict> installed
[19:43:37] <zumba_addict> looks like plain html won't do it since it just gets downloaded by browser
[19:44:12] <jphase> are you not able to install things on your server?
[19:44:40] <zumba_addict> i don't think the boss will want it
[19:44:47] <zumba_addict> what they have there is tomcat
[19:45:01] <jphase> well if they have tomcat, then you can do that in java as well
[19:45:05] <zumba_addict> maybe I can ask the tomcat guys to make a simple service that returns that env varaible
[19:45:07] <jphase> but php is a relatively small package
[19:45:12] <zumba_addict> k
[19:45:13] <jphase> and if you have tomcat, you have apache
[19:45:21] <zumba_addict> yup, we have apache
[19:45:26] <zumba_addict> and tomcat
[19:45:49] <jphase> I mean, if you absolutely have to, you can grab the language from java as well, which could work with a tomcat interface
[19:46:43] <jphase> zumba_addict: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/util/locale_getlanguage.htm
[19:46:49] <zumba_addict> looking
[19:47:09] <jphase> of course java's version is like 10 lines vs. php's 1 line lol
[19:47:22] <zumba_addict> yup :)
[19:47:50] <jphase> also, I'd be curious if that grab locale from server or from the client too, might want to dblck
[19:48:07] <zumba_addict> that's what I noticed on the code
[19:48:52] <jphase> oh
[19:48:56] <jphase> duh, you can do this with pure js
[19:49:02] <jphase> var language = window.navigator.userLanguage || window.navigator.language;
[19:49:06] <jphase> alert(language);
[19:49:48] <jphase> works on ie/safari/chrome/ff apparently, I'd be curious to see what mobile snafus you run into though
[19:55:29] <zumba_addict> jphase, that works in chrome but not in ie9
[19:55:34] <zumba_addict> that's the code I currently have
[19:55:35] <jphase> figures
[19:55:54] <jphase> looks like a server-side option is your best bet
[19:56:07] <zumba_addict> yup, that's what I'm trying to figure out
[19:56:23] <zumba_addict> the guys at #httpd is helping me too using SetEnvIf directive in apache
[19:57:54] <jphase> hmm
[19:58:00] <jphase> ie9 passes language info though...
[19:58:24] <jphase> http://pbi18n.com/2011/04/web-browser-language-detection/
[19:58:39] <jphase> that gives examples of just how different hte language string is though, which might be the problem
[19:58:47] <jphase> you can't just do a "grab first 2 chars"
[19:58:58] <zumba_addict> ok
[19:59:27] <jphase> I mean, in theory, a server-side detection is just as accurate as a js version because the server gets what the browser sends to it
[19:59:59] <jphase> although I'd bet the server-side version formats it to be uniform or something so the en vs sp type characters are in the same spot
[20:00:04] <jphase> brb, need beer
[20:03:43] <zumba_addict> i think problem is that browser cannot sniff the request-header it is sending
[20:05:18] <zumba_addict> jphase: how should I write this in jquery? http://pastebin.com/pizU15dQ
[20:11:06] <tables> how can i send textarea 1's values to textarea 2 with that submit button?    http://jsfiddle.net/BHCdJ/28/           <-- help me fix my code
[20:11:16] <jphase> hmm, looks like you're needing the xhr object
[20:11:41] <jphase> I know you can use like var something = $.ajax(yourstuff)  and it will return the xhr object
[20:11:47] <jphase> zumba_addict ^
[20:12:02] <zumba_addict> ok
[20:12:08] <zumba_addict> i'll try it
[20:12:16] <jphase> but there's also a "beforeSend" in .ajax
[20:12:23] <zumba_addict> that will be on .success right
[20:13:38] <jphase> well I've never really done what you're doing tbh, so I don't know off the top of my head
[20:14:05] <jphase> I'd imagine you'd set var blah = $.ajax('someurl', .... pass your data and all that, and then the blah var would contain your xhr object
[20:14:30] <zumba_addict> testing it now
[20:14:31] <jphase> perhaps something is in there you need, I normally do pretty straight-forward ajax stuff myself, never need to "get" the headers, just modify them before I send them typically
[20:15:03] <zumba_addict> me too
[20:17:49] <jphase> tables: you really shouldn't ever use events inside your elements ever again when using jquery ;)
[20:17:58] <jphase> but you use .val() for textareas
[20:17:59] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/BHCdJ/29/
[20:18:23] <jphase> and your classes and ids are confusing as heck
[20:18:55] <tables> that jsfiddle is not working
[20:19:11] <jphase> it is actually, but you decided to name your first textarea "button"
[20:19:15] <tables> i'm just trying to append what ever is in that textarea to the bottom textarea
[20:19:18] <jphase> so your click event is bound to the first textarea
[20:19:22] <jphase> not the "button"
[20:19:23] <jphase> hehe
[20:22:38] <jphase> tables: I'd recommend cleaning things up to make a bit more sense, this is a start:   http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/BHCdJ/30/
[20:23:29] <jphase> whoops, forgot to clean up your textarea for you... http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/BHCdJ/31/
[20:24:13] <jphase> now the submit button is actually the thing that triggers your event, you don't have onblur and onfocus inline, and the ids make a bit more sense from a readable standpoint
[20:25:55] <andresidavia> any idea why im still getting the danger class alert after i get a response with errors http://pastebin.com/frada0ds
[20:26:55] <jphase> andresidavia: well that'd be because your resp variable is "Reserva registrada correctamente"
[20:27:15] <jphase> er... isn't rather
[20:27:16] <andresidavia> thats why im sending as a response
[20:27:27] <andresidavia> thats the response
[20:27:46] <jphase> you're sure it says "Reserva registrada correctamente"? exactly?
[20:27:49] <andresidavia> so im checking is that string to show a success alert
[20:27:51] <jphase> no spaces or anything?
[20:28:04] <andresidavia> jphase: yes
[20:28:12] <jphase> no different caPS or anything?
[20:28:14] <andresidavia> no
[20:28:18] <andresidavia> exact the same
[20:28:20] <jphase> hmm
[20:28:43] <jphase> well that can't be true, because you have a simple if else
[20:28:50] <jphase> so something in there is amking that not ==
[20:28:54] <jphase> making*
[20:29:20] <andresidavia> is weird
[20:29:36] <andresidavia> im adding a sucess class if its ok wich works
[20:29:39] <jphase> oh
[20:29:44] <jphase> Reserva 'registrada' correctamente
[20:29:50] <jphase> are you sure that's not registrado
[20:29:56] <jphase> with an O instead of an A ?
[20:30:00] <andresidavia> nop
[20:30:05] <andresidavia> its the same
[20:30:07] <jphase> hmm, I got nothin' lol
[20:30:30] <jphase> if there's no funny characters, spaces, and you 100% certain the strings are the same, then javascript itself broke lol
[20:31:26] <jphase> I mean, unless you got another response from the server after alert-danger was added, since the top part of your if doesn't remove that
[20:31:35] <andresidavia> i mean if the first response matches it will trigger the succcess alert but if it doesnt then it triggers the danger alert but then again if it matches keeps the danger alert
[20:32:17] <jphase> andresidavia: make a jsfiddle
[20:32:43] <andresidavia> ive never made a jsfiddle with ajax calls
[20:33:01] <jphase> it works just fine
[20:33:06] <jphase> especially with the way you have your code
[20:33:12] <jphase> it just grabs the action from the form
[20:38:03] <prometh> i'm having trouble figuring out the best way to find ALL elements that contain a specific CHILD element
[20:38:22] <prometh> :has() is for descendants, not children
[20:38:34] <prometh> filter will end up going really deep
[20:39:05] <prometh> i tried doing $("* > element")
[20:39:18] <prometh> that works.. but i need the parents, and only one instance of each in the nodelist
[20:39:31] <prometh> anyone?
[20:43:24] <shoky> $('element').parent()  ?
[20:44:22] <zumba_addict> i'm good now jphase :)
[20:44:26] <zumba_addict> i found a php server at work
[20:44:41] <jphase> makes things much easier
[20:44:59] <zumba_addict> yup, <?php echo $_SERVER["HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE"]; ?>
[20:45:01] <zumba_addict> :)
[20:45:15] <zumba_addict> i'll try it now on IE
[20:45:34] <prometh> shoky: that'd give me duplicates
[20:45:49] <zumba_addict> now I can use ajax to call it
[20:46:32] <shoky> prometh: how so?
[20:46:39] <zumba_addict> it worked in IE jphase :)
[20:46:46] <jphase> :D
[20:46:52] <prometh> shoky: <container> <child/> <child/> </container>
[20:46:58] <prometh> $("child").parent();
[20:47:01] <shoky> prometh: have you tried?
[20:47:11] <prometh> no, i guess i will
[20:47:16] <jphase> that'd be just the one container in that case prometh
[20:47:32] <zumba_addict> and the aweome thing is that I don't need to restart browser :)
[20:47:33] <prometh> i wouldn't end up with [container, container] ?
[20:47:34] <V10Energy> when i call $("#sign_in_user #user_password") It returns: [<input id="user_password" name="user[password]" placeholder="Password" type="password" class="valid">] but for some reason when I am calling .focus() on it, it doesn't work. any ideas why?
[20:47:47] <jphase> prometh: in the example you just gave, no
[20:48:03] <zumba_addict> how can I capture ajax if it cannot reach the server?
[20:48:11] <prometh> is $("child").parent() the same as $("child").eq(0).parent() ?
[20:48:22] <jphase> zumba_addict: you can't
[20:48:28] <zumba_addict> :(
[20:48:47] <zumba_addict> it should return like a timeout error
[20:48:56] <zumba_addict> on .error I guess
[20:49:02] <jphase> prometh: if the children share the same parent then it's basically the same
[20:49:13] <prometh> what if htey don't sahre the same parent?
[20:49:40] <jphase> prometh: then they're different, the second example in that says "grab the first child and get its parent"
[20:50:00] <prometh> cool, thanks
[20:50:14] <zumba_addict> found one, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6977870/in-a-ajax-callback-how-do-i-distinguish-an-unreachable-server-from-a-user-nav
[20:50:25] <jphase> V10Energy: $('#user_password').focus(); doesn't work?
[20:50:52] <prometh> works perfectly
[20:50:57] <prometh> thank you jphase and shoky
[20:51:10] <jphase> it was really shoky not me, but sure ;)
[20:51:12] <jphase> brbeer
[20:52:32] <V10Energy> jphase: n/m. I had to use timeout :) thanks
[21:15:42] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have <div mydiv></div><div><a me></a></div>  how do i get to mydiv form me
[21:15:43] <sheilablackrose> from
[21:16:05] <sheilablackrose> but im trying not to use parent n sibling coz the order could think
[21:16:54] <sheilablackrose> change
[21:20:49] <shoky> sheilablackrose use classes  and .closest()
[21:21:15] <shoky> .closest('.somecontainer').find('.mydiv')
[21:23:48] <sheilablackrose> so i have to go up higher one level than find for something below?
[21:24:37] <shoky> based on the limited info you gave, i'd say probably yeah. but who knows..
[21:25:20] <sheilablackrose> well something like this <div1></div><div2><span1></span></div>
[21:25:24] <shoky> why "like"
[21:25:26] <sheilablackrose> from span1 how can i get to div1
[21:25:30] <shoky> there's a perfectly good tool to show EXACTLY
[21:25:32] <shoky> jsfiddle
[21:25:35] <shoky> you've heard this 100 times
[21:25:38] <shoky> listen, for once.
[21:25:51] <sheilablackrose> ah okok
[21:26:18] <shoky> but you can also just try to do what i suggested
[21:26:22] <zumba_addict> why can't ajax call my php but my browser can call the same php? No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present   CORS crap
[21:26:22] <shoky> and come back later
[21:27:02] <shoky> zumba_addict because that's what same-origin policy is about. its about ajax requests, not requests that the user initiates himself
[21:27:21] <zumba_addict> is it possible to bypass it without setting it on the server?
[21:27:40] <shoky> only by bypassing your browser's security settings locally
[21:27:49] <shoky> for the user's browser, no there's no way
[21:28:21] <zumba_addict> it worked, was able to bypass in php, header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
[21:28:26] <shoky> that's not bypassing
[21:28:29] <shoky> that's setting it on the server :)
[21:28:42] <zumba_addict> yup
[21:28:44] <zumba_addict> :)
[21:28:49] <shoky> goodjob
[21:28:52] <zumba_addict> that's good i don't have to edit apache config
[21:28:58] <zumba_addict> thanks
[21:29:41] <zumba_addict> now I need to properly configure ajax success
[21:29:53] <sheilablackrose> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/m5uT4/1/
[21:30:06] <sheilablackrose> im trying to increment the number count by one each time its called
[21:34:27] <shoky> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/m5uT4/2/
[21:36:37] <sheilablackrose> ahh ok i have to go one up than find
[21:36:39] <sheilablackrose> thanks shoky
[21:38:46] <b0ss_> so show() does not necessarilly set the value of css property to "block", right ?
[21:40:05] <shoky> right
[21:40:13] <mdev> I just know it shows it!
[21:40:17] <mdev> :D
[21:52:11] <luvmyh0nda> Hello! In a draggable-tab situation, how can I disable dragging of a certain tab, while still being able to click said tab?
[21:58:20] <CryptoCoder> Hi, I hope someone can help me, I have a code : http://pastebin.com/VUMmNZ0x  that does work 1.10.1 but seems to be broken on 1.10.2, anyone can help me with that issue, that would be really appreciated ! :)
[21:58:51] <jphase> luvmyh0nda: try using preventDefault in the click event of the tab you're wanting to disable
[21:59:08] <bigOmega> luvmyh0nda do u want to drag the whole content of the tab or just the tab bar?
[22:00:35] <jphase> oh right misread that question, probably the mousedown event perhaps, depends on what library you're using to drag
[22:00:58] <luvmyh0nda> i'm using jquery-ui
[22:01:00] <luvmyh0nda> which means...
[22:01:05] <luvmyh0nda> i should probably be in that channel?
[22:01:14] <luvmyh0nda> or not
[22:01:14] <jphase> ui questions are fine here
[22:01:58] <jphase> luvmyh0nda: try binding to the mousedown event for that tab and using preventDefault
[22:03:14] <CryptoCoder> What I am trying to do is that when the user get on my page, they will enter a password, a key will be generated after a few seconds, then, I want the Submit button to be enabled... anyone has an easy way to do it ? It seems that my code http://pastebin.com/VUMmNZ0x does not work for that, even if I use the .change fonction, I need to go in the box, add a char and click somewhere else for the Submit button to be enabled...
[22:06:14] <mdev> crypto yeah
[22:06:35] <CryptoCoder> mdev: I'm listening ! :)
[22:06:45] <mdev> try $('input#search').keypress(function(e) {
[22:06:49] <mdev> keypress
[22:07:14] <mdev> I had someone help me wtih this exact problem, either keypress or keyup fixed it, when they typed it fired the callback
[22:07:19] <mdev> because change wasn't working
[22:07:32] <checkit> Hey guys... I have three column page of products that I need to filter based on what a visitor types into a search bar on that page... As the visitor types it should reduce the columns to only those items that contain the letters or phrase typed into the search bar. What is the best way to go about this?
[22:07:42] <CryptoCoder> mdev, in fact the code is generated but I never key press or keyup on that box...
[22:08:09] <mdev> "user get on my page, they will enter a password"
[22:08:17] <mdev> how do they enter a password then?
[22:08:29] <jphase> checkit: it'd be hard to say for sure without seeing the markup, but I'd imagine you'd loop through the children in the columns, check to see if the typed phrase is in them, and hide/show accordingly
[22:09:38] <CryptoCoder> mdev, yes in the first box, they enter a password, this password will be encrypted and give a new key in another text box, I need the button to be disable all the time when the last box is empty to make sure they dont click submit before the key has been generated
[22:09:45] <checkit> jphase: Okay. I was thinking of something along the same lines but wanted to check for a better idea before diving in. There are three bootstrap columns containing UL LI's with the product name...
[22:10:07] <zumba_addict> does ie9 know $.ajax?
[22:10:09] <mdev> CrypoCoder try this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17098681/jquery-on-change-on-textbox-not-working-using-jq-1-8-3
[22:10:12] <jphase> zumba_addict: yes
[22:10:22] <mdev> $(document).on('input', '#txtbxhost',  function() {
[22:10:26] <zumba_addict> ok, I'm wondering why my ajax isn't being called
[22:10:32] <jphase> checkit: it'd be pretty easy, you can possibly even use the :contains pseudo selector
[22:10:42] <mdev> or $(document).on('change', '#txtbxhost',  function() {
[22:10:47] <CryptoCoder> mdev: perfect, I try it right now, thanks !
[22:16:33] <CryptoCoder> mdev: Damn, I was sure that it would work, but still, I need to press a key in the second box to work..
[22:17:36] <shoky> zumba_addict:  ie9 doesn't support cors unless you use an xdr transport. include this: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[22:17:53] <zumba_addict> it's not cors issue, it's ajax
[22:18:04] <zumba_addict> i used xmlhttprequest and it's working now
[22:18:06] <shoky> it's cross-domain to a server serving cors headers, no?
[22:18:26] <zumba_addict> yes, using *
[22:18:59] <shoky> weird that it's working with xhr but the jquery way would be to include what i linked and use $.ajax
[22:19:03] <zumba_addict> but maybe, ie9 blocks it before it sees the response. However, it works with xmlhttprequest
[22:19:17] <shoky> ie9 only supports cors using xdr
[22:19:21] <zumba_addict> let me check the link, I just saw it now
[22:20:12] <zumba_addict> how do I use that?
[22:20:37] <shoky> just include it. after jquery, and before your code
[22:20:59] <shoky> (dont include that url. include that file)
[22:21:18] <zumba_addict> k
[22:21:26] <zumba_addict> btw, this is the code that works both in chrome and ie - http://pastebin.com/TDBQCJN7
[22:21:44] <zumba_addict> the only remaining issue though is i can't grab the data in ie
[22:21:50] <shoky> weird
[22:21:54] <zumba_addict> request.response is empty
[22:22:08] <shoky> oh then it doesn't work
[22:22:18] <shoky> try the xdr thing
[22:22:23] <zumba_addict> k
[22:22:58] <zumba_addict> so add xdr.js and then restore my $.ajax code?
[22:23:18] <shoky> yea
[22:23:23] <zumba_addict> ok
[22:23:51] <shoky> you weren't gettig any "access denied" errors in IE9's console, btw?
[22:23:58] <zumba_addict> actually, xhrhttprequest works because response.statusText shows the value
[22:24:06] <shoky> oh
[22:24:12] <zumba_addict> no, i don't get access denied
[22:24:21] <shoky> welp, not sure what's going on
[22:24:22] <zumba_addict> i just need the right property
[22:26:59] <zumba_addict> wow, it's on responseText
[22:27:00] <zumba_addict> lol
[22:27:03] <zumba_addict> i see it now :)
[22:27:41] <zumba_addict> the only remaining checker i need to add is what browser am I using so I can pick between responseText and response
[22:28:36] <mdev> var os = navigator.platform;
[22:28:45] <zumba_addict> cool
[22:28:48] <zumba_addict> trying it now
[22:28:50] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7044944/jquery-javascript-to-detect-os-without-a-plugin
[22:30:42] <zumba_addict> nice
[22:30:48] <zumba_addict> is systemLanguage reliable?
[22:31:49] <mdev> navigator.language and probably systemLanguage should be yeah
[22:31:53] <mdev> they take the value from the header
[22:32:00] <mdev> HTTP 'Accept-Language' header
[22:32:10] <zumba_addict> yup, i had to write a php for that
[22:32:34] <zumba_addict> because navigator.language wasn't returning the language i set in IE
[22:33:22] <mdev> IE such a pain, I always dread testing web projects in it
[22:33:36] <mdev> because I know it's probably going to break something that works fine in every other browser
[22:33:37] <mdev> :p
[22:35:06] <zumba_addict> nope, it's not reliable
[22:35:18] <zumba_addict> it's  a pain
[22:39:03] <zumba_addict> it's working great now in IE :)
[22:39:31] <zumba_addict> testing it now in chrome, lol
[22:40:10] <zumba_addict> worked great too!
[22:53:08] <zumba_addict> shoky, your xdr.js worked better
[22:53:11] <zumba_addict> :)
[22:53:32] <zumba_addict> when I transferred my code to another machine, I got access is denied. My xhrhttprequest started failing
[22:53:46] <zumba_addict> thanks for the help :)
