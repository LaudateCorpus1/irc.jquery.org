[02:26:11] <bkxd> jQuery is rejecting my JSON file when I call $.getJSON due to parse error
[02:26:16] <bkxd> can you tell me what is wrong with my JSON? https://dpaste.de/22oF
[02:27:13] <bkxd> perhaps NaN needs to be wrapped in quotes...
[02:28:43] <bkxd> yes, that was it
[10:30:47] <lilalinux> I load several js files via script tags. Each file contains $(document).ready(function() {...}); How do I synchronize their loading so that I can access variables and functions of one inside the other?
