[00:00:43] <mindis|wurk> hmm, having a symmetrical padding seems to help quite a bit
[00:02:20] <impi_busy> http://jsfiddle.net/CA592/ <--- something im missing but if i want to declare a function inside my html, how can i get it so that i can call it on an onclick?
[00:09:51] <krz> anyone used plupload before? wondering what the runtimes are used for
[00:15:22] <Symbi0nt> impi_busy : http://jsfiddle.net/CA592/2/
[00:16:37] <impi_busy> Symbi0nt: thank you dude
[00:26:47] <bestKoderEver> hiii
[00:35:15] <jaffipaffi> Hey, is it possible to make UI calendar post to three inputs (yyyy, mm and dd)?
[00:36:54] <krz> is it fine to have jquery and mootools together in an application?
[00:36:58] <krz> ooops
[00:37:00] <krz> anyone used plupload before? wondering what the runtimes are used for
[00:46:11] <bestKoderEver> anyone done a $.ajax GET call to a server?? how does one do it..??
[00:47:15] <xec> bestKoderEver: have you looked at the docs?
[00:48:35] <xec> some good examples there, but as a complete beginner you might want to look at the simpler wrappers like $.get()
[00:54:00] <bestKoderEver> hey
[00:54:13] <bestKoderEver> i try to call on a server side method..
[00:54:20] <bestKoderEver> should it just not be:
[01:15:17] <Xotix> hi, the height remains empty, why? http://pastebin.com/MDydMG7P the console.log gives me 155. both of them. Why doesn't it get attached?
[01:24:54] <Marko_> Xotix: pls copy it to js fiddle with html
[01:25:47] <Xotix> Marko_ $("#myForm").attr('action', '/frontend/upload/width/' + $(this).width() + '/height/' + $(this).height() + '/'); works, it's because of the missing / at the end, but why?
[01:27:39] <Cork> Xotix: might depend on how the server parses the url
[01:28:24] <Xotix> yeah, also thought about something like that. hmm, anyway thanks
[01:33:09] <bestKoderEver> anyone good at jquery+ .net?
[01:33:17] <bestKoderEver> i want to call on a method...
[01:44:20] <xec> bestKoderEver: you can call on methods as urls using asp.net mvc or webservice or wcf. what is your question?
[02:07:24] <krz> how the heck does one install http://www.plupload.com????
[02:09:33] <DireFog> hi all, is there a way to have a datepicker on a span that only shows when clicking the text?
[02:11:16] <Axsuul> When setting a checkbox using .prop("checked", true), this doesn't trigger the 'change" event. Does anyone know what event I can bind to to detect this property being set (there seems to be no callback either)
[02:13:20] <Axsuul> Nm, it seems .prop("checked", true).trigger("some-event")
[02:13:36] <Axsuul> I mean .trigger("change")
[02:15:04] <soc42> hi #jquery
[02:15:06] <soc42> is there somekind of built-in form validation in jquery or do i have to use additional jquery plugins?
[02:15:29] <Hooloovoork> soc42: there's nothing built in except doing it manually.
[02:19:33] <soc42> Hooloovoork: do you do validation manually or can you suggest any plugins for validation as best practice?
[02:20:41] <Hooloovoork> soc42: if it's a lot of validation it's easier to use something like http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation but if you just have one field or something it's easier doing it by hand.
[02:21:22] <soc42> Hooloovoork: thanksalot, i'll have a look on it
[02:24:49] <AdvoWork> anyone know of any jquery plugins etc for invoices etc?
[02:25:56] <soc42> Hooloovoork: well, do you know where to find the plugin.... js-file for http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation ?
[02:26:31] <iYuri> hi all
[02:26:52] <iYuri>  I have a problem of execution
[02:26:59] <iYuri> when user click on a button
[02:27:15] <iYuri> I have to execute four different php file
[02:27:26] <iYuri> 1-simple execution
[02:27:39] <iYuri> 2-execution in loop (so many times)
[02:27:42] <iYuri> 3-simple execution
[02:27:44] <iYuri> 4-execution in loop (so many times)
[02:27:56] <iYuri> how could I be sure that
[02:28:00] <soc42> the plugins site seems cvurrently under development... see http://plugins.jquery.com/
[02:28:08] <iYuri> file 2 is executed when file 1 has finished??
[02:29:01] <iYuri> and so on: file 1 finish -> file 2 start -> 2 finish -> 3 start -> 3 finish -> 4 start -> 4 finish -> alert('Ok');
[02:29:02] <iYuri> :)
[02:29:39] <Hooloovoork> soc42: just look at that page, i'm sure it's somewhere in the text.
[02:30:21] <Hooloovoork> soc42: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[02:31:24] <soc42> well, i've just been looking on pages like http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/
[02:31:42] <soc42> but didn't find it, so again thanksaloit
[02:33:10] <Hooloovoork> np
[02:42:22] <soc42> hey Hooloovoork, what do you think about http://www.jformer.com/ ? seems quite powerful...

[02:55:00] <rohit00082002> I call finalPrint() with some data. and I am not getting venueData.city in it.
[02:55:17] <rohit00082002> scope problem. don't know how to fix it.
[03:00:09] <rohit00082002> anyone please ?
[03:04:05] <asda> What does this do? (function ($) {
[03:04:14] <asda> ... }(jQuery));
[03:05:06] <mansoor> asda, it setups up a self executing function,  passing in the global variable jQuery -  which inside the function is refered to as simply $
[03:05:16] <VictorCL> what0s the best way to check if a variable is empty  ?
[03:05:18] <VictorCL> or set
[03:05:39] <mansoor> VictorCL,    var foo;   foo === undefined
[03:05:58] <mansoor> is that clear?
[03:06:16] <VictorCL> I remembersomething about  variable.val() != 0
[03:06:43] <mansoor> VictorCL, that shouldn't work unless that variable is an object with a method called val()
[03:06:56] <VictorCL> ok
[03:07:14] <mansoor> VictorCL, OHHH a jqury object..
[03:07:45] <mansoor> i thoguht you meant a normal JS variable   http://api.jquery.com/val/
[03:11:30] <VictorCL> if I have this list and inside there is a <a href=''>    how can I find the <a that has a specific href ??

[03:21:48] <VictorCL> this is not working $(".main-menu li a:contains('"+uri_string+"')");

[03:40:43] <bestKoderEver> hi
[03:40:50] <bestKoderEver> in this link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1360253/call-non-static-method-in-server-sideaspx-cs-from-client-side-use-javascript
[03:41:07] <bestKoderEver> in the first answer they use jquery..
[03:41:13] <bestKoderEver> is that ok to do??
[03:42:07] <alex88> hi guys, if i run a $.each on a set of elements, with an ajax request in the callback function, the requests are done sequentially or all in one time?
[03:48:59] <xec> bestKoderEver: you're in #jquery - asking if jquery is ok to use?
[03:49:45] <keybo> what would phpmyadmin replace special chars with if i was adding them to a password for a user?
[03:54:44] <shomon> hi
[03:55:12] <shomon> I'd like to validate a file input field: I want to make sure it's a valid filename with a pdf extension

[04:06:34] <scratcha> .animate() is being exceptionally laggy when attempting to animate multiple large images at once. any suggested solutions to this to optimise performance ?
[04:09:12] <Hooloovoork> scratcha: depends on the situation when optimizing animations. it's hard stuff to do.
[04:09:24] <scratcha> I've found this
[04:09:24] <scratcha> http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/
[04:09:28] <scratcha> going to look into it
[04:09:40] <Hooloovoork> scratcha: you could try containing the images in a div and animate the divs instead. dunno if it faster but it might.
[04:09:59] <scratcha> ^ anyone know if theres any substance in that ?
[04:11:12] <Hooloovoork> scratcha: well, looks ok. i'd never use it but it might be faster in your case =P
[04:11:56] <scratcha> i was asking if anyone knew if i stuck the images in a div, would it be quicker ?
[04:16:44] <Enverex> I'm trying to use the jquery plugin "Autocomplete" but the GET variable (term) that it sends, it sends as ?term= which isn't working in my instance as it's part of an existing URL that already has other GET variables in it. Is there an easy way around this?
[04:20:43] <kul> hello I have 1 question ! I'm using ajax to call other pages from the website using.load() function but when I call this function I would like to change the link in my address bar. hOw can i go ahead?
[04:20:52] <kul> http://www.reserved.com/en/home <-- This is my reference link ..
[04:22:31] <ph88> when using an effect http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/  do i need to specify an id in my html $( "#button" ).click(function() {}  or can i use a class also ? $( ".button" ).click(function() {}
[04:29:38] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/59/ - why does the grey field get "thrown forth and back" when you hover the orange field? Shouldn't it just slide down all naturally?
[04:29:41] * muzone is now playing: All Natural - 50 Years (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PViK8wTabhg)
[04:30:58] <bigkevmcd> Enverex: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp <- use a custom source for your autocomplete, and make the request with whatever parameters you need
[04:32:49] <Enverex> bigkevmcd: That lets me specify more options but I'm not sure it solves the issue of the first data: variable being sent as ? and not &...
[04:34:43] <techouse> hey! i'm wondering if there is any other way to append multiple documentElements than simply creating them in a for loop and appending them in that same for loop
[04:34:56] <bigkevmcd> Enverex: You can send any parameters you like
[04:35:00] <techouse> can append handle an array of these elements?
[04:35:15] <bigkevmcd> Enverex: the geonames.org site doesn't use "term" either
[04:36:32] <GyroB> hi there
[04:37:18] <Enverex> bigkevmcd: No, it sends ?callback= instead, which is just as bad. I need autocomplete to ONLY send &whatever=. I don't care what the variable is called, but it cannot use ?
[04:37:49] <bigkevmcd> Enverex: you realise that's because the type is jsonp ?
[04:38:27] <techouse> oh, i see, appending them to the document fragment first
[04:38:38] <bigkevmcd> Enverex: my advice is to use that code, but, to change the source function to just console.log(request.term) and you'll see what I mean
[04:41:59] <muzone> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WHxhx/59/ - when hovering the orange field, why does the grey field below get all jumpy and stuff?
[04:42:02] <muzone> At http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335461/jquery-slide-is-jumpy the solution seems to be setting height and width, but that doesn't seem to help much.
[04:42:05] <muzone> If you help me out I'll let you borrow my beach hut in French Polynesia for about a month or so (http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bora-bora/interesting/show).
[04:48:45] <Enverex> bigkevmcd: Haha, I'm doing it that way, but it's still passing the first variable as ?, so it's still the same issue
[04:48:59] <Enverex> I need to get it to pass ALL variables, as &, not just subsequent ones
[04:51:21] <shwaiil> hi
[04:51:57] <shwaiil> Q: can someone give me a example of a associate array  OBJECT in Js, created doing  a loop ? I would like to access it like painel[1][item] = x; and so on
[04:51:59] <shwaiil> thanks for looking!
[04:52:37] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: you want a array of objects?
[04:52:53] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: tks for looking..yeah can be
[04:52:58] <Hooloovoork> like this [{key: val}, {key: anotherval}]
[04:53:49] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: need to know exactly what it is you want before i can tell you how to do it =P
[04:54:23] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork:  I would like to have access to a multidimensional array like in php.
[04:54:23] <vl4kn0> is there a way how to select particular year in datepicker with changeYear option?
[04:54:33] <shwaiil> So, from what I've read I need objects.
[04:54:41] <shwaiil> something like u sugested, sounds fine to me. to my problem.
[04:54:54] <shwaiil> Liek the example I gave too would be just fine.
[04:55:06] <ph88> how do i prevent my div sliding in multiple times when doing mouseover on the other div ??? http://pastebin.com/KAkHvfx5
[04:55:10] <shwaiil> any kind of help is appreciated. anyway i'm doing some testing
[04:56:13] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: var array; for(var i; i<limiter; i++) { array.push({ key: "value", id: 2 }); }
[04:56:35] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: thanks i'll try that one
[04:57:24] <Hooloovoork> var array = []; instead of var array;
[04:57:28] <Hooloovoork> i think you need that =P
[04:57:31] <Hooloovoork> for push to work
[04:58:11] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork:  works just fine. thanks a lot
[05:00:33] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: I'm getting a array with many objects hmmm :T maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I'm trying to have arr[key] = list of objects here for that key
[05:01:02] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: so you want another dimension?
[05:01:09] <Hooloovoork> just add it =P
[05:01:20] <shwaiil> yeah trying to pull that one :)
[05:01:56] <shwaiil> whats the syntax for arr[key].push() ?
[05:02:08] <Hooloovoork> exatly that
[05:02:21] <Hooloovoork> arr[key].push(stuffiwannapush)
[05:02:41] <Hooloovoork> if arr[key] is an array
[05:03:17] <shwaiil> ok tks
[05:05:16] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: doing something wrong :) http://pastie.org/private/7szqc0q1qht70oxzljdvtq
[05:05:44] <shwaiil> TypeError: painels[k].push is not a function
[05:06:07] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: you have to decide how the array will look
[05:06:20] <Hooloovoork> [] means array and {} is a object or associative array
[05:06:31] <PaulIIIIIIII> http://www.hot.ee/keber/pilt.JPG
[05:06:59] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: you mean like arr = [1,2,3,4] ?
[05:07:15] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: think json
[05:07:29] <Hooloovoork> make a simple design of your array and/or object
[05:07:38] <Hooloovoork> and then i can tell you how to build it
[05:08:01] <shwaiil> ok tks
[05:08:07] <_ramo1> can i check if a id on a page exists?
[05:08:18] <Hooloovoork> _ramo1: sure
[05:08:31] <_ramo1> ah okay
[05:08:37] <Hooloovoork> _ramo1: if($("#id").length) {}
[05:08:42] <_ramo1> just if($('#ads'))
[05:09:16] <Hooloovoork> hmmm, that might work too
[05:09:17] <Hooloovoork> try
[05:11:28] <erichynds> no, it won;t
[05:11:34] <erichynds> gotta test the .length prop
[05:12:22] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: the best example I could come up is in php http://pastie.org/private/vyuskh82hnahddakcyan2g :T
[05:12:28] <shwaiil> its easier for me to explain
[05:13:11] <shwaiil> its because I want organize some data, like data[1] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; data[2] = [2323, 3434, 54545];
[05:13:28] <shwaiil> so, if accessing data[1] I know the values 1,2,3,4 and
[05:13:48] <shwaiil> if accessing data[2] I know 2323, 3434, 54545
[05:13:57] <shwaiil> I dont know if I was clear enough :)
[05:15:56] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: i think it's time asking what you are trying to do. sounds like something is wrong if you have to organise your data like that.
[05:16:06] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: so just explain what it's for.
[05:16:39] <shwaiil> I've got a number of painels or pages, and each painel or page, as given Id's, wish are unique.
[05:16:55] <shwaiil> Painel[1] = [1212,2323,4334,5445,54,65,454545]
[05:17:03] <shwaiil> Painel[23] = [1,2,34];
[05:17:04] <shwaiil> :P
[05:17:33] <shwaiil> each painel or page, can have one or more values
[05:17:37] <shwaiil> a list.
[05:17:53] <Hooloovoork> still don't understand why
[05:18:43] <hex`> How do I get the value of a JSON Object so I can use inside a tag? http://dpaste.com/693916/
[05:19:51] <Hooloovoork> hex`: json is a string, not a object
[05:19:57] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: that's how the data is saved and I want to retrieve it
[05:20:09] <Hooloovoork> hex`: can't see the data value in your example
[05:21:10] <hex`> Hooloovoork: console.log(data) == Object { limit_error=[1]}
[05:21:13] <shwaiil> I want to have access to each individual records, so I can easily retrieve the painel where a given  ID is at
[05:21:35] <Hooloovoork> hex`: data is already a object, you can't parse it as json
[05:21:56] <hex`> it is coming as json, from php json_encode
[05:21:56] <shwaiil> looping trough all painels.. to check where ID 4334, based on my example above, would return on Painel[1] ..so... I know it's in painel 1
[05:22:21] <Hooloovoork> shwaiil: just change the example i made before to push in a array instead of a object
[05:22:26] <Hooloovoork> with the values you want
[05:23:10] <hex`> Hooloovoork: console.log(data) when data is exactly what's coming from the server (no parsing this time) == {"limit_error":["Invalid number"]}
[05:23:23] <shwaiil> Hooloovoork: ok tks
[05:23:47] <manisabri> Hi. I'm receiving an HTTPError in my fail handler of $.ajax call... how can I get the body of the message from this data which is a complete html page?
[05:24:22] <Hooloovoork> hex`: so the result is a array, just extract it like one
[05:24:24] <manisabri> I tried $('#container',data)   $('#container',$(data))  and  $('#container',$(data.responseText)) all of them returning []
[05:24:34] <Hooloovoork> hex`: parsed_data.limit_error[0]
[05:25:53] <hex`> so console.log is like a var_dump, that's what was getting me confused... why was showing in the console, but not in the browser
[05:26:02] <hex`> using as an array works, thanks Hooloovoork
[05:26:48] <Hooloovoork> hex`: console.log() is your bestest buddy.
[05:27:15] <Hooloovoork> need the documentation for a object? console.log() it and you've got it!
[05:27:44] <Hooloovoork> wanna draw pretty ascii images? console.log() it!
[05:32:56] <manisabri> I have an javaScript object which has an html in its responseText how can I select an ID in it ?
[05:35:17] <_dave_h_d> hi all, I have an issue with animate function, namely i have a stage div which I fill with a few divs using ajax ajax data - async:false, I then start sliding the stage div but the problem i am finding in webkit browsers is that the first child does not move along but rather stays
[05:35:32] <_dave_h_d> the rest slides normally
[05:35:42] <_dave_h_d> anyone else come across this problem?
[05:37:13] <raj> can I select a particular element only when at a particular url?
[05:37:45] <Kototama> hi, why can I do $('rect').click(...) but not $('rect')[0].click(...) ?
[05:37:57] <raj> Kototama, maybe it's not a list
[05:38:03] <raj> or an array or whatever
[05:38:13] <moesti> dave: u know u have to use .live() if u load content with ajax and want to bind it with something?
[05:38:15] <raj> it's probably just returning one thing
[05:38:26] <raj> do you mean .rect btw?
[05:38:29] <raj> vs #rect
[05:39:18] <Kototama> i would like to iterate over all 'g' element and add a click listener
[05:39:28] <JabberwockyA19> Form validator does not validate "as you type" the first time a input-field gains focus. Once the filed is de-selected (blur) the input-field it validates. The second time the input-field gains focus validation is done "as you type" (on each key event).
[05:39:41] <Kototama> but you're right it's an object that I get, not an array, so not sure what $('g')[0] returns in this case
[05:40:17] <manisabri> can I convert an string to html with jquery?
[05:40:39] <raj> Kototama, what kinda element is g?
[05:40:47] <Kototama> i also tried $.each($('g[id]'), callback) but can't add a .click on the returned element
[05:40:54] <Kototama> it's a svg element
[05:40:58] <raj> manisabri, just append it
[05:41:31] <manisabri> raj : I want to select a part of it
[05:41:49] <raj> regex i think
[05:43:16] <manisabri> hmm
[05:43:42] <ph88> how do i prevent my div sliding in multiple times when doing mouseover on the other div ??? http://pastebin.com/KAkHvfx5
[05:45:45] <moesti> how can i break an ajaxrequestP?
[05:48:54] <Kototama> ok i guess my question is simply: how can i iterate over the element returned by a jquery selectors and still have them as jquery object?
[05:53:20] <anli_> Hm, nothing seems to show up when I use jquery-checkbox
[06:01:09] <sysadmin4hire> jsfiddle = broken yes?
[06:01:28] <JAAulde> sysadmin4hire: no
[06:01:33] <JAAulde> sysadmin4hire: working here
[06:01:39] <sysadmin4hire> doesn't load on mine...weird.
[06:02:03] <sysadmin4hire> Oops! Google Chrome could not find jsfiddle.net
[06:02:06] <sysadmin4hire> same with IE.
[06:04:10] <udp> sysadmin4hire: working fine here
[06:05:01] <sysadmin4hire> well what the crap... :(
[06:05:27] <chee> perhaps you have dns issues, sysadmin4hire
[06:05:29] <sysadmin4hire> maybe my dns is jacked up ... rebooting :D
[06:05:35] <chee> luckily you are a sysadmin
[06:05:38] <sysadmin4hire> :D
[06:05:40] <chee> so this will not be a problem
[06:05:42] <Kototama> ok the problem was that selectors.each iterates over DOM elements, not jquery elements
[06:07:38] <chee> if he reboots to fix a dns problem, i won't be hiring him any time soon
[06:09:15] <udp> chee: he probably uses windows, you're meant to reboot every few hours there anyway :p
[06:09:55] <rogeruiz> udp: You make it sound like a diff planet ;)
[06:10:11] <chee> it's more like another universe
[06:10:43] <udp> one where they decided to throw out all those silly standards like the laws of physics
[06:10:45] <rogeruiz> Ha
[06:14:15] <rogeruiz> Kototama: Don't forget to wrap up your doms if they're in a nested function.
[06:25:12] <ph88> how do i prevent my div sliding in multiple times when doing mouseover on the other div ??? http://pastebin.com/uCPqgU5c  (updated link)
[06:25:17] <anoc> hello
[06:25:42] <anoc> first time for everything! I see that the jquery plugins site is down
[06:25:56] <Kototama> rogeruiz: how do you get a jquery element from a dom element?
[06:26:11] <kborchers> anoc: it's been down for a long time
[06:26:25] <kborchers> ph88: see ?g javascript debounce
[06:26:26] <bot-t> ph88, Debouncing Javascript Methods | unscriptable.com - http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/
[06:26:57] <anoc> i'd like to know that how does the plugins work! i have jquery-plugins.js and many plugin js-files. How do i add them to the site correctly - i mean what file to modify so that the plugins are loaded ?!
[06:27:09] <kborchers> Kototama: $(element)
[06:29:17] <Kototama> ah cool! thanks all
[06:30:03] <anoc> please help, i'm confused and no help site
[06:33:02] <kborchers> anoc: i have no idea what jquery-plugins.js is. in general, you include jQuery, then include the plugin, then create an instance of the widget or use the plugin according the that specific plugin's documentation or what ever
[06:38:20] <anoc> ok so it was a non standard file. So real question is how to use jquery-insert with plugins
[06:41:59] <sysadmin4hire> lol silly DC was being a jerk... :D JSFiddle LIVES!!!
[06:42:31] <JAAulde> anoc: what *is* jquery-insert?
[06:46:24] <muzone> At https://gist.github.com/1689105 - 2.js is the ideal candidate right? (form swapping)
[06:48:07] <xec> muzone: looks like the 1.js has a document ready event nested inside a document ready event
[06:48:12] <Heshanh> anyone know a good time plugin to go with the date picker
[06:49:07] <xec> Heshanh: not that i know of, but this looks promising: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1245245/jquery-date-time-picker
[06:50:16] <alexr2_> I have a list for ranking that I need items to switch places nicely, anyone know a good plugin for this?
[06:50:19] <mytoz> question: is it possible to fire the bound ready events manually?
[06:50:58] <mytoz> I'm trying to write a behaviour test in jasmine, heh
[06:51:40] <JAAulde> muzone: 2.js def looks better, though I don't understand why any of the return sttements are in there
[06:51:42] <muzone> xec: true
[06:51:56] <muzone> hmm
[06:52:17] <ph88> thx kborchers
[06:52:21] <ph88> kborchers++
[06:52:26] <muzone> JAAulde: some checkout login form for spree
[06:52:33] <kborchers> np
[06:52:54] <JAAulde> muzone: but that doesn't explain the returning...
[06:53:03] <ph88> kborchers:  doesn't jQuery have specific debouncing stuff for that ?
[06:53:40] <JAAulde> a function passed to doc ready doesn't *need* to return anything, and if an event handler (like .change()) should have *any* return, it should be a bool...
[06:54:08] <muzone> JAAulde: well if the user selects the "yes, my password is:", sign in and proceed to regular checkout
[06:54:18] <muzone> user selects "no, i don't have a password", proceed with guest checkout
[06:54:24] <muzone> well thats the plan hehe
[06:54:34] <muzone> JAAulde: so are you telling me i can achieve the same thing here but with less code?
[06:54:42] <JAAulde> but your returns doesn't affect any of that
[06:54:45] <muzone> *warm fuzzy feeling*
[06:54:50] <JAAulde> muzone: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/gzvbcde83tczp4eumw5ivw
[06:55:06] <fitztrev> question... Is there a good mapping tool/function to convert charCode/keyCode numeric values to their corresponding character? ex: 97 = a, 13 = enter
[06:55:10] <kborchers> ph88: we use that technique in some places, specifically in UI that i am aware of but there isn't "stuff" you can use.
[06:55:44] <muzone> JAAulde: fucking AAAAAAA+
[06:55:52] <JAAulde> lol
[06:56:13] <sysadmin4hire> question: why is my remove name button not working?
[06:56:16] <sysadmin4hire> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[06:56:17] <muzone> JAAulde: what's dataprop?
[06:56:18] <racquad> hi there, i'm looking for a simple function to animate a change between two images. something different from the well known fadein/fadeout. Any tip?
[06:56:46] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: works fine for me
[06:56:55] <JAAulde> muzone: rather than rewrite the same form attr line twice with different values, I set whatever value to a var (dataprop) and use that in a single $form attr line
[06:57:07] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: if the box is supposed to fadeout after a delay at least...
[06:57:16] <racquad> i would be glad to find any animation similar to that airport's panels...
[06:57:34] <sysadmin4hire> ...? no - im supposed to be able to add and remove the elements.
[06:57:39] <sysadmin4hire> (text box)
[06:57:53] <kborchers> sysadmin4hire: did you paste the wrong link?
[06:58:00] <sysadmin4hire> probably.
[06:58:03] <kborchers> that fiddle has nothing to do with what you are describing
[06:58:17] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: how are you gonna achieve that with a fadeout function?
[06:58:23] <sysadmin4hire> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[06:58:34] <sysadmin4hire> i think its not giving you the updated one.
[06:58:49] <kborchers> so click update and then re-copy the link
[06:59:10] <sysadmin4hire> where's the update?
[06:59:13] <sysadmin4hire> dang im a noob to js.
[06:59:20] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: look for a button that says "update"
[06:59:22] <Hooloovoork> press
[06:59:28] * JAAulde giggles
[06:59:29] <Hooloovoork> copy link and paste here =P
[07:00:47] <mantas322> if I cache jquery-1.7.js locally
[07:00:48] <sysadmin4hire> oh weird.
[07:00:53] <mantas322> will i run into problems trying to use it?
[07:00:56] <sysadmin4hire> - ok plz hold. found my problem :D
[07:01:38] <JAAulde> mantas322: what d you mean, cache jQ locally?
[07:01:57] <sysadmin4hire> and now completely forget about my question. found my issue :D
[07:02:01] <mantas322> im not 100% sure
[07:02:04] <Hooloovoork> JAAulde: i always run it locally =P
[07:02:07] <Hooloovoork> no wait
[07:02:09] <Hooloovoork> mantas322:
[07:02:28] <mantas322> if I include the jquery.js file in my cache manifest
[07:02:34] <sysadmin4hire> http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/
[07:02:38] <sysadmin4hire> see it now?
[07:03:00] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: no cause you didn't press update and re-copy the url =P
[07:03:09] <JAAulde> mantas322: what's a cache manifest?  (I am no mocking, you, I am not aware of the paradigm within which you seem to be working...)
[07:03:09] <sysadmin4hire> i swear i did.
[07:03:29] <mantas322> html5 cache manifest
[07:03:29] <anoc> JAAulde: jquery-insert is this: it has no documentation :D  http://code.google.com/p/insert-script/
[07:03:37] <t4nkd> Hey jquery, what's the name of the event that triggers when you have focus on an text field input and press enter/return?
[07:03:51] <kborchers> sysadmin4hire: no, you didn't because when you do, it adds a number to the end of that URL
[07:03:56] <mantas322> I might be asking a dumb question, so mock me if you want :/
[07:04:21] <JAAulde> anoc: yikes, script loading is a bit complex to be using a piece of code which has no docs!
[07:04:46] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/11444/
[07:04:54] <JAAulde> mantas322: lol, well, if I can determine, without doubt, that it is dumb then I will be sure to mock you. ;)
[07:05:04] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: my god! are you using jsfiddle as a ide?
[07:05:09] <JAAulde> mantas322: at this point, I don't understand your terms.  but that could very well be my own lacking, not yours
[07:05:11] <Hooloovoork> 11444 revisions?
[07:05:13] <sysadmin4hire> Hooloovoork: lol...
[07:05:30] <mantas322> its cool, thansk for your interest.
[07:05:37] <JAAulde> sysadmin4hire Hooloovoork: HOLY FRIGHT!
[07:05:37] <mantas322> sometimes just thinking outloud in irc helps :>
[07:05:43] <JAAulde> mantas322: true
[07:05:51] <sysadmin4hire> dangit. no im not.
[07:05:52] <sysadmin4hire> geez
[07:05:55] <Xotix> I have a textarea. In there i got that: Some Text <span>xxx</span>.  Can i add a click event to this span so i can click on it within the textarea and then do something? Also, i don't show the span or other html in the textarea.
[07:06:32] <sysadmin4hire> is it better to toss your js into a separate file example.js and call it in?
[07:06:36] <Hooloovoork> sysadmin4hire: is this what you are looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/r7MgY/11443/
[07:07:06] <JAAulde> Xotix: that is a very confusing question/statement
[07:07:12] <sysadmin4hire> Hooloovoork: lol no - not at all...its all sorts of jacked up.
[07:07:26] <Xotix> JAAulde: okay wait i give an example.
[07:07:43] <sysadmin4hire> i've broken it.
[07:09:06] <Hooloovoork> start from scratch with a new fiddle =P
[07:14:23] <Xotix> JAAulde: http://jsbin.com/uqopas hope it makes it more clear. Is this possible somehow?
[07:15:30] <JAAulde> Xotix: it is not possible in a direct manner, but you may want ot lookinto this plugin: http://www.examplet.buss.hk/jquery/caret.php
[07:15:35] <nicholasschulz> Is this the correct way to disable a button? $(submitButton).attr("disabled", "true");
[07:15:39] <mantas322> hmmmmm
[07:16:03] <JAAulde> nicholasschulz: if you are on jQ 1.7+ you should use prop for that, not attr
[07:16:29] <nicholasschulz> jaaulde just replace attr with prop?
[07:16:45] <JAAulde> nicholasschulz: yes
[07:17:00] <nicholasschulz> Okay, :-) maybe thats why it doesn't work
[07:17:20] <Xotix> JAAulde:  hm mthanks. No, it's enoug hcomplex already, don't want another plugin. I'll just do the styling part and leave heo onclick to the "not in teaxtarea" mode. But thanks
[07:19:03] <nFFF> Homies, this is throwing infite loop error: jQuery('.lightbox').append(function(){ jQuery('.lightbox').load('http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/checkout/cart/'); });
[07:19:55] <antaranian> hi there
[07:20:24] <JAAulde> Xotix: nop roblem
[07:20:31] <JAAulde> Xotix: *no problem*
[07:21:03] <antaranian> having some trouble with html2canvas library while loading images
[07:21:05] <antaranian> so the "ready" isn't fired, how can I deal with it ?
[07:21:12] <kborchers> nFFF: you shouldn't need the append. load() will put the data in .lightbox see ?load
[07:21:12] <bot-t> nFFF, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[07:21:22] <kborchers> not that one bot-t
[07:21:24] <nFFF> kba_, thanks
[07:21:37] <kborchers> nFFF: http://api.jquery.com/load/
[07:22:16] <nFFF> same response
[07:22:16] <muzone> JAAulde: "i took the liberty of assuming you only want to change the. action of the form the changed radiobutton is actually in. JAAulde's code will change all forms"
[07:22:38] <nFFF> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
[07:23:14] <muzone> JAAulde: and he wrote this: https://gist.github.com/1689195 what you think?
[07:23:33] <JAAulde> muzone: ythe code you posted already did that, mine just continued it.  If there is more than one form on the page, your form query will grab them all.  If you have a specific form you want, adjust the selector
[07:23:43] <kborchers> nFFF: then there are now elements with the lightbox class in the dom yet. see ?ready
[07:23:44] <bot-t> nFFF, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[07:24:11] <muzone> JAAulde: there is only one form in which this swapping is done
[07:24:24] <muzone> in a life or death situation which one would you go for?
[07:24:35] <JAAulde> muzone: understood.  the code you originally posted was already selecting all forms
[07:24:40] <JAAulde> muzone: hold one...
[07:25:11] <muzone> JAAulde: i see i see..
[07:25:35] <sysadmin4hire> ok so i have a form with multiple elements ... im trying to create a "part" where if a user hits TAB on their keyboard from the first field- they will create a new dropdown box and textbox directly underneath the first one to enter similar information.
[07:26:06] <muzone> JAAulde: for what it's worth, here's the whole thing: https://gist.github.com/1645923
[07:26:09] <sysadmin4hire> in the end - i need to pull all of the information - pass it to php and drop it into mysql.
[07:26:34] <nFFF> kborchers, I'm sorry, are you saying the DOM is loading new page before it's readdy?
[07:27:10] <JAAulde> muzone: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/0jp1svmwarjxl4svpw5rna
[07:27:41] <kborchers> no, that error message is telling you that $(".lightbox") matched not elements and thus the Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
[07:27:49] <kborchers> matched no*
[07:28:18] <muzone> JAAulde: perfect!!
[07:28:48] <JAAulde> muzone: although I don't think the se;ector `radio.action-switcher` will work...
[07:28:59] <JAAulde> that implies an elmement named radio
[07:29:14] <JAAulde> seems `input:radio.action-switcher` would be more appropriate
[07:30:09] <JAAulde> muzone: but if ti's working as is, then I guess I'm wrong on that
[07:30:44] <muzone> JAAulde: i dont have any .radio classes, no
[07:30:55] <muzone> err
[07:31:03] <muzone> i have no elements named radio, no
[07:31:07] <muzone> thanks for noticing
[07:31:14] <muzone> and for coding heheh
[07:31:15] <JAAulde> muzone: right on
[07:31:24] <muzone> right on!!
[07:31:24] <chee> right on!
[07:31:26] <JAAulde> muzone: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/fv4lqkbhvntuixvvmgvq
[07:31:30] <muzone> right on right on!!
[07:31:38] <JAAulde> muzone: you're welcome
[07:32:09] <muzone> JAAulde: the use strict is important?
[07:32:38] <JAAulde> muzone: I use it pretty religiously, but you can pull it out
[07:32:39] <muzone> JAAulde: and the $(function () { inside (function ($) {?
[07:33:06] <muzone> i'll read up on it - i'm feeling religious today
[07:33:22] <JAAulde> muzone: the outer wrapper was a reproduction of what you had shown originally.  as long as you have jQ defined and not in "no conflict" mode, you can remove the outer wrapping fun too
[07:34:15] <muzone> yes sir..
[07:34:25] <JAAulde> muzone: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jo8g6q6ffwprhkjigozp1a
[07:34:27] <JAAulde> should be fine
[07:36:32] <nFFF> kborchers, I'm confused; surely to even trigger the load() function $('.lightbox') must exist as a valid selector and class
[07:37:04] <nFFF> if $('.lightbox').load(blah.html); even attempts to load, surely the selector has found class lightbox?
[07:37:21] <kborchers> nFFF: not true
[07:37:43] <kborchers> ?demo @ nFFF
[07:37:43] <bot-t> nFFF, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:39:03] <z0ned> i'm trying to preload a set of rollover images so that when you roll over them there is no delay. it works perfect and instantly in chrome/ie, but firefox/safari seem to be having issues. can anyone help? http://www.loftness.com/Corporate/logixlines.php
[07:40:57] <nFFF> kborchers, http://jsfiddle.net/WRKsU/
[07:42:22] <Symbolic> Z0ned: it locked my browser
[07:42:40] <z0ned> Symbolic, locked?
[07:43:26] <Symbolic> Yeah, it just hung. Ill try ie
[07:43:41] <z0ned> what browser?
[07:43:52] <z0ned> any errors?
[07:44:10] <Xotix> Do you think the first answers with the css height is okay? http://tinyw.in/32jD or should i go with adding columns? if possible
[07:46:12] <z0ned> Symbolic, what browser? were there any errors in the console?
[07:50:05] <JAAulde> wow, the jQ bug tracker site is slooow
[07:50:24] <JAAulde> submitting a big or comment takes like a min
[07:50:45] <JAAulde> PcJamesy: in or out, you! :P
[07:50:50] <nFFF> kborchers, any ideas?
[07:54:22] <kborchers> nFFF: in my tests, it seems to be working fine, though jsfiddle's ajax testing seems to be acting up. i would try converting .load() to .ajax() and use the success callback to drop the content in the span. it's just more flexible and may lead you to your issue
[07:54:45] <Symbolic> Z0ned: sorry got pulled away. I was using dolphin on android
[07:55:01] <mantas322> raaage >:O
[07:55:29] <nFFF> kborchers, is the problem to do with the original DOM, or the page being loaded?
[07:55:36] <nFFF> or could it be either
[07:56:50] <Xotix> If i have something which gets triggered by keypress, how can i get the key which was pressed?
[07:57:05] <mantas322> check the params
[07:57:41] <kborchers> well, that error would lead me to believe it has to do with your page, not what you are loading but i don't get that error in your fiddle so there is an issue somewhere else in that page causing it
[07:57:46] <kborchers> nFFF: ^
[07:58:34] <tash> so this seems weird to me...have a form and on submit I'm grabbing data from the server with .get() and then doing a .html to re-create a table on the page. I'm re-creating the table with the same ID's, class, etc.  But the button looks entirely different.  Without looking at code, can anyone make sense of that?
[07:59:00] <nFFF> kborchers, thanks
[07:59:01] <tash> and, a .click that should be tied to a button in the new table isn't working ... do I have to do some kind of reloading of the page or something?
[07:59:08] <nFFF> I think it could be to do with the page being loaded
[07:59:29] <nFFF> I'll try loading the html direct through the framework
[07:59:37] <nFFF> Do you know why this is breaking the javascript:
[07:59:39] <nFFF> jQuery('.lightbox').append('<?php echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock('safeguard/template')->setTemplate('cartcheckout/cart.phtml')->toHtml(); ?>');
[07:59:45] <nFFF> I can't see whats up
[07:59:49] <nFFF> something to do with the PHP
[07:59:54] <nFFF> is there an extra ' or something
[08:00:44] <z0ned> anyone know if there's a command to clear cache/refresh in Safari? (like ctrl+f5 in firefox)
[08:01:08] <tash> nFFF ... maybe put double quotes where your first and last single quote are?
[08:01:29] <Symbolic> NFFF: you too many ' in there
[08:02:01] <nFFF> tash, that shouldn't matter I don't think
[08:02:06] <nFFF> Symbolic, which one?
[08:02:11] <nFFF> I can't see it :<

[08:10:38] <PeterPan-> hey guys, I got question regarding load() and swap(); I am using sammy.js on the client side to load data and parse it into a template
[08:11:19] <rmaceissoft> something similar to dropdown box, with open,close callback to include html via AJAX
[08:11:23] <sennahoj> how do I swap multiple elements if I download them not via bulk and instead in a loop one by one
[08:12:42] <b-lew> Can I score some help ^?

[08:17:42] <SamK1975> Hi all, I need to select all descendants up to and including a certain class (but not its descendants). any ideas?
[08:17:51] <`Korvin> What is the consensus method of stepping when drawing to a canvas
[08:18:16] <`Korvin> I'm currently using settimeout(function(){}); which has some inconsistency between chrome and ff
[08:18:56] <`Korvin> SamK1975, I'd just each loop until I got to that top parent
[08:19:07] <`Korvin> rather for loop
[08:19:13] <t4nkd> Is the best way to test the enter/return keypress on an input element to create a condition for the event.which or is there any easier way to prevent the submit event on enter/return when focused on an input?
[08:19:52] <polorix> Hey guys. So, I have this Joomla site, that uses this third party search component with spiffy ajax to display results on the fly. My problem is, the CSS is loaded from a dynamically loaded cache file of style.css which I can't edit as it gets reloaded when ever you refresh. I want to be able to apply a width property to this element once the page has loaded (or css in general). How do i do...
[08:19:54] <polorix> ...this with jquery?
[08:20:00] <SamK1975> Korvin: yes I could do it with loops, thought there might be some cunning selector
[08:20:20] <`Korvin> I don't know of one, but that doesn't mean there isn't one =p
[08:29:31] <rmaceissoft> hi all again, some suggestion of jquery plugin to implement this http://i.imgur.com/Z3mDy.jpg (dropdown box with open, close callback to include into it html via ajax)
[08:30:47] <xmaddness> Is there a way to do a selector based on two items in an element? Like li[data-value$=3345] and li.selected <--?
[08:31:47] <xmaddness> nevermind, I just answered my own question I think
[08:31:59] <xmaddness>  li[data-value$=3345].selected <--?
[08:32:00] <`Korvin> li.selected[data-value$=3345]
[08:32:08] <xmaddness> or that looks better
[08:32:09] <xmaddness> thanks
[08:35:26] <SamK1975> does unbind() recurse down and unbind all descendants?
[08:35:55] <SamK1975> or just remove the handlers on the element you call it on?
[08:39:49] <gaius65> Hi!
[08:40:34] <gaius65> How can I execute a function as soon a a iframe is loaded?
[08:40:52] <gaius65> $('#iframe').ready(fn) is firing BEFORE the iframe dom is ready
[08:47:23] <`Korvin> gaius65, due to cross-site specs, you can't manage information within a frame
[08:47:45] <`Korvin> meaning javscript has no access to the contents
[08:47:46] <`Korvin> at all
[08:50:33] <jeffreylevesque> i have <div class='eventToggler'>Show</div>.... if I wanted to change the value, is this good: $('.eventToggler').text().replaceWith('Hide');
[08:51:11] <nFFF> jeffreylevesque, why not try it?? :)
[08:53:47] <hays_> Does anyone here have experience with Superfish?  I am trying to make it so I can have <li>s of <a>s and <span>s instead of just <a>s
[08:54:07] <hays_> I think there is a problem with this because superfish may be using spans somewhere to get some other stuff done...
[08:54:28] <hays_> I want the links in my menu to look like links and for the non-links to look like non-links.
[08:55:07] <jeffreylevesque> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/dwFsJ/1/
[08:57:08] <JackBauer24> hays_: can't you just set a different class for the links that should look like non-links?
[08:59:20] <hays_> JackBauer24: hmm perhaps
[08:59:56] <hays_> $('a',this); looks like something that is grabing the links.  I wonder if I can change this to $('a, span', this)
[09:00:07] <hays_> although it would be nice if it only grabbed spans with no class

[09:54:25] <pensfan> I have a select box and each option has a value which corresponds to an id.  Is there a way to store xml in the document so that I can look up from the value of the selected option?
[09:57:45] <pensfan> is there a way i can read xml from a variable and xslt translate it?
[09:57:47] <ph88> how to see if an element is already shown or is hidden ? which property indicates this ?
[10:00:18] <chee> Jayflux: can you make a jsfiddle that recreates the errur
[10:00:29] <Zzaichik> ph88:  .css() as a param in a conditional statement
[10:00:29] <chee> errer

[10:01:01] <chee> errir
[10:01:09] <`Korvin> arrar
[10:01:37] <Jayflux> chee would take a while, theres a lot involved in what comes up. Part of a slider with ajax content etc. Would probably be easier giving a link
[10:01:37] <ph88> Zzaichik: .css() with no extra .css(parameters) ?
[10:02:07] <Jayflux> chee mind if i pm you?
[10:02:08] <Zzaichik> ph88: Well, you'd have to tell it what element you want to check.
[10:02:25] <chee> Jayflux: it'd be best not to
[10:02:39] <`Korvin> ph88, he's suggesting if (element.css('display') == 'hidden')
[10:02:49] <chee> Jayflux: i'm not very likely to be able to help, and it would be best to get everybody's eyes on it
[10:02:59] <chee> it's in your own interests

[10:13:36] <andrew9183> what's the  proper way to do this?
[10:13:51] <andrew9183> i always run into this and hack away to get it working
[10:13:51] <kevrom> Is there a way to to narrow down a selection based on a data object's value?  I my example is I have a group of objects with the '.round' class.  I'd like to select only the one with data('number', 1)
[10:15:27] <kborchers> kevrom: you can pass a function to filter that would take care of that for you see ?filter
[10:15:28] <bot-t> kevrom, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:15:31] <andrew9183> ah the solution is prevAll()
[10:15:49] <kevrom> excellent, thanks kborchers!
[10:18:32] <tash> I might suck at working this question, but going to try.  If I .html() over an existing table, and that table had a button whose ID was "blah", for example.  And, I have some jq that says when I click the button with ID "blah" do *this* ... why, when I .html() over the existing table, and create the same button with the same ID, will the .click event not work?
[10:19:50] <chee> andrew9183: although you've already found your solution, i want to complement you on a very attractive and well put together jsfiddle example
[10:22:51] <aslant> With jquery.ajax, as part of the body of the request is an object containing an empty array as the value of a key/value pair. This empty array key/value pair is not getting sent. Any ideas why?
[10:23:06] <Kartagis> hi
[10:23:34] <Kartagis> what happens if different jquery versions are used on a website?
[10:26:17] <Zzaichik> tash: how about an example. I'm assuming it's because it was created after the DOM loaded, if I understand you question.
[10:26:32] <monk12> hello all, i was curious what is a better option and why... to make an ajax call to a controller to get 100 table rows, and then return the table rows and markup to jquery and just output that.... or return json array from a controller, and have jquery loop over that and create the markup and display it. which way is prob faster?
[10:27:11] <Zzaichik> Kartagis: You mean, multiple versions on a single page? If it's a different version on each page.. and your code is actually valid in that version it shouldn't be a problem.
[10:27:44] <Zzaichik> Kartagis: Even though I wouldn't recommend it.. That sounds like it's not a very smart idea
[10:27:54] <Kartagis> Zzaichik: different versions on a single page
[10:28:53] <Zzaichik> Kartagis:  You will most likely not get the desired result.
[10:31:29] <Zzaichik> Kartagis:  This might work. http://bit.ly/zQysT1
[10:31:47] <andrew9183> chee: lol very attractive?
[10:32:11] <chee> andrew9183: yes! i was moved by it. it was simple and effective
[10:32:49] <Zzaichik> andrew9183:  Sexy.  No I'd had to agree, very concise and easy to understand.
[10:38:43] <monk12> Got the server boot, not sure if any one answer my question. just curious if anyone has a preference on for an ajax call, to create html serverside or return json and create markup client-side
[10:45:01] <joshualibrarian> Okay... why does a maroon box not replace the purple box?  http://jsfiddle.net/Qxm22/29/
[10:45:14] <andrew9183> my company is driving me nuts.
[10:48:02] <Phrogz> joshualibrarian: Syntax error prevents all your code from running. Open your console.
[10:48:19] <Phrogz> joshualibrarian: All your ; should be , inside the CSS object.
[10:48:56] <Zzaichik> joshualibrarian: no semi-colon after styles in .css(). use commas.  and the background color hex code should be surrounded in quotes…
[10:50:23] <Phrogz> joshualibrarian: Also, don't use anchors for triggering JS, use a <button>
[10:50:25] <Kartagis> I'm not sure what breaks the jquery functionality I need on my page. how can I debug?
[10:51:40] <Phrogz> joshualibrarian: Also, you have JSFiddle set to use MooTools, not jQuery
[10:52:09] <monk12> Is there a way to access the original json data format in a $.ajax call ...i see you can do $.ajax(... success: function(){ this.data } ); but data is in url encoded format. any better way to get at the orig data?
[10:52:09] * joshualibrarian is thankful.
[10:53:07] <Zzaichik> Phrogz: haha - I didn't even think to look there. Today needs to go away and die.
[10:53:36] <monk12> like any quick jquery function  can make &param1=x&param2=y into a json array?
[10:54:13] <Phrogz> monk12: You can specify plaintext as the receiving type.
[10:54:20] <Phrogz> Then you'll need to decode it yourself.
[10:55:07] <Phrogz> monk12: You mean turn "?param1=x&param2=y" into { param1:"x", param2:y }   which you could turn into JSON, if you wanted?
[10:56:07] <Phrogz> monk12: I guess you want the opposite of $.param() ?
[10:56:08] <monk12> Phrogz: so this is the original data (this.data) and not the response data (data). so in the success callback, i want to get the original json params i sent up (i return response html btw but just want orig data sent in "data: {param1:'x',param2:'y'}" section
[10:56:31] <monk12> this.data returns the json data i sent up.... but in query string format unfortunately
[10:57:07] <monk12> so I could send back the original variables in the response i guess (and change the resposne to json)... but looking for a way to do it smarter.
[10:58:08] <Kartagis> I'm not sure what breaks the jquery functionality I need on my page. how can I debug?
[10:58:27] <Phrogz> monk12: Can you describe more simply what you want to do (not how you want to do it, but what you want to confirm)?
[10:58:36] <zatan> Hi can anyone recommend a plugin for automatically changing a images?
[10:58:44] <Phrogz> Why not just latch onto the data object you passed as a variable and then reference that in your handler?
[10:58:57] <Phrogz> zatan: "automatically changing a images"
[10:59:32] <zatan> Phrogz,  its like every 10seconds switching to another image sorry for my bad english
[11:00:11] <monk12> Phrogz, hmm i guess this is the most simple thing i wanna do: In the success callback, I want to get what i sent up in data, (param1 and param2)
[11:01:34] <Phrogz> monk12: But you already have it, right? Like this:
[11:02:19] <Phrogz> var orig = makeMyData(); $.getJSON( '/foo', function(data){ console.log("I sent",orig,"but got back",data); });
[11:03:22] <monk12> Phrogz... yes u right... that sets up a closure... i was just trying to figure out if could get it via the ajax object itself so i didn't have to move the options declaration outside of it;
[11:03:26] <monk12> cool i'll just do that
[11:04:12] <monk12> *(think thats how it works via a closure since ajax callback called later, so has access to variables in same scope)
[11:04:33] <Phrogz> monk12: Correct, that works because the callback is a closure.
[11:05:05] <monk12> sweet, looks like its working. thanks!... i wonder if there is a jquery plugin to do that now though. break down a query string.
[11:05:23] <Phrogz> monk12: You could always wrap it:       function handleCallback(data,oldData){ ... };   $.getJSON('/foo',orig,function(data){ handCallback(data,orig) } );
[11:08:50] <cbovard> Hello, When I am making a <A> and using the href with a #, for a jquery click event. How do I make sure the # does not go in the URL, or is there a better way to do this? thanks in advance!
[11:09:29] <monk12> Phrogz, cool while I gotcha here. another question... Is there a preference to make html markup on the server and return it... or return json data and loop through to create content client-side. making like a 100 rows on server not sure whats most efficient.
[11:09:39] <monk12> server is quick... but js could just do it quick with markup too.
[11:10:34] <Phrogz> monk12: I don't have a good answer here, except to say that (if it's fast enough) I think you should keep all your view logic in the same spot, either on the server (which I prefer) or in JS.
[11:10:36] <h0st1le_> does anyone know how i place {} inside css with messing up the markup?
[11:10:37] <Zzaichik> cbovard: Goooogle
[11:10:45] <cbovard> i did
[11:11:10] <Phrogz> Mixing the two is going to make your life harder (especially non-DRY if you are making the same markup both on the server for initial load and on the client for AJAX load.)
[11:11:20] <tash> Zzaichik: yep, it is created after the DOM is loaded.  I don't know how to re-create the DOM so to speak...i still consider myself a mega newb
[11:11:35] <Phrogz> monk12: I personally use partials on the server when building the page and AJAX requests for the HTML that uses the same partials.
[11:11:54] <Phrogz> monk12: Which is why I made http://phrogz.net/JS/AJAXFetch/
[11:11:56] <supsup> if you do a ajax request and the returned request has a javascript global function inside of it, does it get registered to the global scope or since it was added later does it not get added?
[11:13:11] <monk12> Cool, thanks Phrogz. I'll have to check your plugin out in a lil'.
[11:13:17] <Zzaichik> cbovard: What  you want to do is prevent the default action  .preventDefault() Now you can google your brains out.
[11:13:30] <cbovard> thank you.. that is all i needed.
[11:13:37] <Zzaichik> cbovard:  haha np
[11:14:15] <Phrogz> supsup: You mean you have a <script>fun foo(){...}</script> block in your returned HTML and you append it to the page?
[11:14:21] <supsup> ya
[11:14:26] <supsup> sorry i should of said response
[11:14:34] <Phrogz> supsup: That will create a global function (well, global to the window object you're in.)
[11:14:49] <supsup> cool is that considered bad practice?
[11:14:54] <supsup> or just normal
[11:15:10] <Zzaichik> cbovard didn't like the way I spoke to him apparently.
[11:15:10] <supsup> is it better to have the functions preloaded in the page pre-ajax call?
[11:15:17] <Phrogz> supsup: I'm not sure why you'd create/replace a global function like that, but it's not unheard of to run raw code in a <script> block you return.
[11:15:32] <Phrogz> supsup: Probably better to have a single JS file that can be read and cached once.
[11:16:38] <dzhus> hi thar

[11:18:06] <mheap> Evening
[11:18:29] <mheap> I'm trying to click and drag over multiple <td>'s, and have an event fire for every one I hover over while the mouse button is depressed
[11:18:42] <mheap> Is there an easy way to do it, or do I need to use a combination of mousedown and hover?
[11:19:48] <supsup> Phrogz: thanks
[11:20:33] <Phrogz> dzhus: Your browser will handle that. In the end the DOM it creates will be XHTML friendly, but it's up to the browser as to what DOM is created.
[11:20:35] <MistuhKurtz> if i want to use two variables that reference jquery objects for selectors, should i just do var1.add(var2).doSomething(); ?
[11:21:28] <Phrogz> mheap: The problem is that while you're dragging one TD, it is always under the mouse cursor, so you won't get hovers. What you need is to pop it occasionally to see what's below, using…

[11:26:07] <Murof> make it better, make it faster :) http://jsfiddle.net/KMadE/22/
[11:30:37] <mheap> Phrogz: a combo of hover+mousedown works fine
[11:31:04] <k_89> is there a js script which auutomatically prefixes your css client side
[11:31:07] <mheap> http://pastie.org/3265163
[11:31:15] <mheap> k_89: Yes, sec
[11:31:26] <k_89> ahh cool
[11:31:34] <mheap> http://leaverou.github.com/prefixfree/
[11:32:39] <k_89> he helped me and left the chan
[11:32:43] <k_89> thanks a ton
[11:36:02] <tash> http://pastie.org/3265182 <--- line 3 of this hits the server and the returned data is literally a table with table elements.  Since the DOM is loaded already, how can I re-load the dom?  If I'm using the wrong terminology, I apologize.  I need to connect to an ID from the new table though. That's my goal.
[11:48:23] <tash> n/m, figured it out using .live
[11:52:51] <queuetip> i have a stupid question, if i'm already using the jquery.ui library will i already have access to ui.draggable ?
[11:53:22] <queuetip> i see an example where someone is including ui.draggable as a separate library is the only reason i ask
[11:53:34] <queuetip> -i'm not much of a front end guy :|
[11:53:46] <xec-> queuetip: jquery ui is modular - it depends on what modules you have included
[11:54:19] <queuetip> xec-: i'm just including: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8/jquery-ui.min.js
[11:55:05] <xec-> queuetip: i would assume that includes about everything - try to make something draggable and see
[11:55:34] <linusoleander> Anyone know if there is a plugin to simulate writing ?
[11:55:46] <queuetip> xec-: heh, yeah i'm just being retarded, when i just simply view that file i see that it already does have it :) thanks for your time and answer
[11:57:58] <queuetip> another stupid question, i found an independent library for multi-div-select draggable .. i don't know how else to say that, but is there any more like official support for multi-selectable draggable divs? the one i found you just press control to select multiple divs to drag
[11:58:32] <queuetip> it looks okay, i was just hoping that ui sortable would actually have support for it but it doesn't
[11:59:20] <xec-> queuetip: well, jquery ui have both selectables and draggables, i'm guessing they can be combined
[12:00:17] <xec-> queuetip: google found me this http://www.ryancoughlin.com/2008/11/23/combining-selectables-and-draggables-using-jquery-ui/
[12:01:10] <queuetip> xec-: i'm using ui sortable right now to drag and drop, which works just fine, just would like to also make it multi-select via ctrl or some other button, i'll read that link now though, thanks
[12:02:39] <queuetip> xec-: the actual final demo doesn't work for me :|
[12:04:26] <xec-> queuetip: ha, it doesn't here either. says "$ is not defined" -- looks like he left out jquery from the demo page :P
[12:04:34] <xec-> funny
[12:05:11] <queuetip> xec-: yeah, if you want to see the example i found... it's a little quirky though: http://comp345.awardspace.com/multi/multi2.html you press shift to multi select drag
[12:05:27] <queuetip> xec-: the code is pretty simple and neat
[12:06:02] <xec-> queuetip: yeah it is a bit strange,  doesn't quite work like i would expect
[12:07:42] <brettster> hey guys
[12:07:43] <brettster> $("#containerbg").css({ opacity: 0.8 });
[12:07:49] <brettster> why is this not working AT ALL
[12:08:04] <brettster> that is the correct way to do it?
[12:09:01] <brettster> xec what do you think?
[12:09:34] <xec-> brettster: i think it should work, check out http://jsfiddle.net/FZnqN/
[12:10:48] <brettster> http://cityofoneonta.org.s109594.gridserver.com/index.php/government/
[12:10:50] <xec-> brettster: make sure your code is ran after #containerbg exists in the DOM
[12:10:51] <brettster> thats the live page
[12:10:57] <brettster> ahh
[12:11:08] <brettster> so put it in the footer?
[12:11:20] <xec-> yeah, or inside document ready event
[12:11:47] <xec-> brettster, like: $(document).ready(function(){ /* do stuff */ });
[12:12:03] <brettster> in that case
[12:12:06] <brettster> thank you
[12:12:07] <brettster> :)
[12:12:10] <xec-> yw :)
[12:12:29] <MistuhKurtz> hmm
[12:12:30] <MistuhKurtz> so
[12:12:52] <MistuhKurtz> the change event doesn't fire when you change a select with the keyboard?
[12:13:43] <MistuhKurtz> oh i guess when you change focus is when it fires
[12:13:50] <xec-> MistuhKurtz: yes
[12:14:46] <xec-> queuetip: http://jsfiddle.net/PDPZx/
[12:15:28] <xec-> queuetip: you can select multiple by dragging mouse and make a square like you would with icons in windows explorer
[12:16:21] <queuetip> xec-: woah, nuts
[12:16:36] <queuetip> xec-: holy crap that's awesom
[12:16:38] <queuetip> awesome*
[12:17:08] <dzhus> what is the "$ is not a function" I get from backbone using jquery?
[12:17:13] <xec-> queuetip: yeah, only downside is i can't select multiple by holding ctrl down
[12:17:36] <xec-> dzhus: jquery isnt included (yet) or noconflict has ran
[12:17:56] <xec-> dzhus: these are wild but probable guesses ;)
[12:17:58] <queuetip> xec-> yeah that's true, but that can be easily added i think... i'll need to add it for what i need, since there's a list of items that need to be multi-selected and they might not want to select everything sequentially
[12:18:21] <dzhus> xec-: oh god thank you
[12:18:22] <xec-> queuetip: yeah, it's a good start for sure
[12:18:31] <dzhus> xec-: should have included jquery before backbone
[12:18:34] <queuetip> xec-: definitely, and the code is clean and small. thanks
[12:19:14] <xec-> queuetip: it's copypaste from the demo that didnt work, so its well documented in that article as well
[12:21:08] <z0ned> hi
[12:24:46] <saddishwasher> afternoon all
[12:25:00] <xec-> evening
[12:25:44] <saddishwasher> I'm looking for a way to execute a click event for all elements except a button.  Preferably without having to manually type in each element type in my selector
[12:25:59] <saddishwasher> some sort of exclusion list… I don't know
[12:26:09] <xec-> ?not @ saddishwasher
[12:26:09] <bot-t> saddishwasher, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:27:04] <xec-> saddishwasher: are you using latest (1.7.*) version of jquery?
[12:27:10] <saddishwasher> xec-,yes
[12:27:30] <saddishwasher> so .not() coupled with $('*') ?
[12:27:46] <saddishwasher> I know that wont work
[12:27:59] <xec-> saddishwasher: you probable don't want to bind to *all* elements, thats a lot of handlers
[12:28:19] <xec-> saddishwasher: which will execute for each element the event bubbles to on each click
[12:28:31] <saddishwasher> eeww
[12:28:40] <z0ned> vernondotjpg, cool name!
[12:28:53] <xec-> saddishwasher: look at api.jquery.com/on/
[12:29:25] <kborchers> saddishwasher: just use on and if the target isn't a button, perform your action
[12:29:46] <xec-> saddishwasher: you can probably do something like $(document).on('click', ':not(button)', function(){})
[12:30:08] <saddishwasher> xec-, cool I'll give it a shot
[12:30:13] <xec-> saddishwasher: where that function is the handler
[12:30:42] <HUMBLEGUY> anyone wth ideal on where  i will credit card
[12:30:57] <saddishwasher> Just as an f.y.i. I'm trying to remove a class for 'button' when anything else but 'button' is clicked
[12:31:18] <xec-> saddishwasher: what is the use case? (what does the class do?)
[12:32:42] <saddishwasher> xec-, I'm creating an iPhone app (jquery-mobile is not relavent - I'm just looking for the philosophy) - I want it to emulate the slide-to-delete functionality iphone already has where you can swipe a listitem and the 'delete' button comes up, then hides when anything else is clicked
[12:34:01] <saddishwasher> kboardshorts!
[12:34:12] <tash> does jq have an issue with dashes in variable names?
[12:34:13] <kborchers> yo
[12:34:18] <xec-> saddishwasher: you could just do $(document).click(function(){ $("selectallthedeletebuttons").hide() })
[12:34:26] <tash> hmm, bad question maybe ... sigh
[12:34:42] <saddishwasher> xec-, but I don't want the delete button to hide when 'delete' is clicked
[12:34:48] <saddishwasher> which is why I need to exclude it
[12:35:06] <tash> I'm getting an error: CO677 is not defined, in firebug ... and right below it, it shows jobNumber = 11-Co677-5; ... so the variable is there and has a value
[12:35:15] <saddishwasher> tash, use underscore
[12:35:22] <xec-> saddishwasher: yea but you have a click event on that already right? just return false; to prevent bubbling
[12:35:34] <xec-> on the delete btn that is
[12:36:16] <saddishwasher> xec-, gotcha
[12:36:22] <xec-> then the other click event won't fire because its bound to a lower level dom element
[12:37:03] <saddishwasher> xec-, nice I was thinking $(document) would 'override' all other event bindings on lower level elements
[12:37:57] <xec-> saddishwasher: no, fortunately the bubbling starts the other way :) not so easy in vanilla js though, with different browsers implementing different bubbling models
[12:38:23] <tash> saddishwasher: what if I need to pass it with dashes?
[12:38:33] <saddishwasher> dont
[12:38:56] <saddishwasher> :p - I ran into this too, I just got tired of messing with it and changed things to underscores
[12:39:02] <Will987> Anyone interested in buying a website where users can sign in with social networks and show their online status on chat applications and services. Fully complete and all modifications are free. PM me for pricing. DEMO: http://myonlinestat.us/josh
[12:39:16] <tash> the table in the database records job numbers that way ... the person who wrote it, used dashes ... I need to update a table where job number = blah which has dashes in it :(
[12:39:32] <tash> I need to pass jobNumber to my server in .get()
[12:39:42] <xec-> tash: "-" in javascript means minus... do you want it in a string perhaps?
[12:39:54] <tash> I could probably rebuild the job number and add dashes server side, but idk
[12:40:08] <xec-> tash: what about jobNumber = "11-Co677-5";
[12:40:21] <tash> yeah, let me try that
[12:41:25] <xec-> your code basically said "set jobNumber to eleven minus the value of Co677 minus five" ;)
[12:42:08] <saddishwasher> next question - I've just recently started working with multiple classes for elements (I know - stone-age stuff).  What would my selector look like to reference an element like <li class='button redButton'>
[12:42:30] <xec-> saddishwasher: li.button.redButton
[12:42:36] <saddishwasher> cool thanks
[12:42:43] <tash> xec: thanks, that worked
[12:42:47] <xec-> or .redButton.button also works
[12:42:51] <tash> not sure why I didn't think of quote'ing it
[12:45:34] <paki> !list
[12:48:39] <microhxo> Guys i am having major issues trying to post using ajax.  http://paste2.org/p/1885808   I keep getting OPTIONS instead of POST. This happens when i set the ContentType.
[12:49:45] <Dave_Stein> microhxo: why are you escaping your data like crazy?also you have user var by password and visa versa
[12:49:57] <Dave_Stein> you can safely do { password : pass, userName: user }
[12:50:16] <Cork[home]> microhxo: are you doing this from www.thesitewiththevalidation.com?
[12:50:17] <microhxo> it needs to be json
[12:50:20] <microhxo> cork
[12:50:22] <microhxo> no i am not
[12:50:27] <Cork[home]> then you can't do it
[12:50:34] <microhxo> I changed the site
[12:50:37] <Cork[home]> ajax isn't allowed to other then the saim domain
[12:50:45] <Cork[home]> *same
[12:50:53] <microhxo> So if its on the same domain as me
[12:50:54] <microhxo> it wont work.
[12:51:01] <Dave_Stein> if it IS on the same domain it will work
[12:51:03] <Cork[home]> if its not, yes
[12:51:07] <Cork[home]> yes
[12:51:11] <microhxo> The site is hosted on our network
[12:51:20] <Dave_Stein> network doesn't matter, just actual domain name
[12:51:27] <microhxo> ah
[12:51:41] <Cork[home]> microhxo: some browsers allow the server to overide this
[12:51:44] <Dave_Stein> also, you should use $.toJSON rather than having poopy escaping everywhere which is very error prone
[12:51:46] <Cork[home]> but as always, no ie
[12:53:32] <Cork[home]> microhxo: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control
[12:53:42] <Cork[home]> works in firefox, chrome opera and safari
[12:54:23] <saddishwasher> xec-, so it appears that not everything in $(document) can bind to the jqTouch tap event (or touch or click)
[12:54:33] <microhxo> Cork, im not sure how i'd use that.
[12:55:06] <saddishwasher> xec-,I would excpect my action to happen when I click in the background or anywhere and it only happens when I click <a> links
[12:55:14] <Cork[home]> microhxo: the site your on needs to allow requests to the other domain
[12:55:21] <Cork[home]> microhxo: as a http header
[12:55:30] <microhxo> so that needs to be added to the server?
[12:55:35] <Cork[home]> yes
[12:55:43] <xec-> saddishwasher: could you make a quick demonstration? see ?demo
[12:55:43] <bot-t> saddishwasher, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:55:44] <Cork[home]> your apache config
[12:55:57] <Cork[home]> or nginx or what ever your using
[12:56:07] <saddishwasher> xec-, I can't unless you have iOS simulator with xCode
[12:56:38] <xec-> saddishwasher: um, what for? just make a jsfiddle and visit the site with a phone?
[12:57:07] <saddishwasher> xec-, do you have an iphone?
[12:57:11] <xec-> yes
[12:57:16] <saddishwasher> ok let me work on it
[13:00:36] <tash> ugh, stupid IE
[13:03:26] <xec-> tash: if only i had a penny for every time some developer experience grief over IE... i could buy microsoft! :P
[13:04:44] <blindMoe> anyone have a recomendation for a twitter style news scroller plugin, where the new items are added to the top and the rest are slid down
[13:04:49] <tash> xec: :) I'm pretty new to dev, so it is frustrating b/c I don't know what to look for really.
[13:05:00] <tash> And worse, it is some really old code that was handed to me.
[13:05:27] <tash> oh well, I've got a buddy local that can help me dig through it.
[13:07:35] <nitrospectide> Can anyone tell me why this would work with 1.3.1 and not 1.5.1? http://pastie.org/3265675
[13:09:44] <xec-> nitrospectide: do you get any errors in console?
[13:10:12] <Murof> silly :)
[13:10:50] <nitrospectide> xec-: "Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined"
[13:11:24] <xec-> nitrospectide: you 100% sure you included jquery lib? :)
[13:11:33] <Murof> are you executing it after jquery is being included...?
[13:11:36] <Murof> kkk same ^^
[13:11:45] <nitrospectide> doh!
[13:12:04] <nitrospectide> I didn't have the .min in the link to the .js file :(
[13:12:14] <xec-> :)
[13:12:17] <Murof> -_-
[13:12:20] <nitrospectide> thx!
[13:13:07] <b1lly> is there away to search an array for a value and return its key
[13:13:29] <xec-> ?each @ b1lly
[13:13:30] <bot-t> b1lly, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[13:13:36] <blindMoe> if I have an array of elements $('li') is there an easy method to apply css to only the last n items in the array?
[13:15:05] <blindMoe> I want something like $('li').filter(':last[10]'); but I can't seem to find it
[13:15:08] <xec-> ?slice @ blindMoe
[13:15:08] <bot-t> blindMoe, .slice(start, [end]): Reduce the set of matched elements to a subset specified by a range of indices. http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[13:15:21] <blindMoe> ahh nice thanks
[13:16:56] <xec-> b1lly: i think you would need to check each value, and return key when you find it
[13:17:28] <xec-> b1lly: this is the each method i meant: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[13:18:54] <Murof> iterating with one array as argument, never seen it
[13:18:59] <Murof> nice to know
[13:19:20] <Murof> remenber me of map()
[13:19:24] <xec-> b1lly: actually... you can use .indexOf() in modern browsers, directly on the array
[13:19:49] <xec-> IE8 will hate you though :)
[13:20:32] <xec-> b1lly: oooh... i found something! see ?inArray
[13:20:33] <bot-t> b1lly, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:20:38] <xec-> there we go
[13:21:44] <xec-> you confused  me with the "key" wording, as arrays dont have keys, they have an index :)
[13:21:45] <Anime> i'm trying to make sure the page loaded all images using $(window).load, but it only triggers sometimes despite the net tab in firebug not showing it has anything else loading. is this a reliable way to make sure everything loaded or are there alternatives?
[13:22:53] <xec-> Anime: i haven't had issues with it, can you reproduce the issue reliably?
[13:23:06] <b1lly> when i use indexOf and have the same character twice, does it return the one closest to the end?
[13:23:19] <Anime> not really, it just happens sometimes, and sometimes not
[13:23:24] <Anime> more like 50/50
[13:23:26] <xec-> b1lly: i would assume it returns the first one
[13:25:32] <b1lly> xec- anyway to return the last one instead
[13:27:02] <xec-> b1lly: do .reverse() on it first
[13:28:11] <xec-> ?eval ["a", "b", "c", "a", "d"].indexOf("a")
[13:28:12] <bot-t> xec-: 0
[13:28:21] <xec-> ?eval ["a", "b", "c", "a", "d"].reverse().indexOf("a")
[13:28:23] <bot-t> xec-: 1
[13:28:42] <xec-> hehehh
[13:28:49] <xec-> i foresee one issue
[13:29:35] <xec-> ?eval ["a", "b", "c", "a", "d"].lastIndexOf("a")
[13:29:37] <bot-t> xec-: 3
[13:29:40] <xec-> yay
[13:30:11] <xec-> b1lly: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf
[13:30:42] <xec-> b1lly: make sure you read the part under compatibility
[13:41:21] <phun-ky> i need help with an error message i get on this code: http://pastebin.ca/2106875 : "TypeError: $ is not a function"
[13:41:33] <phun-ky> the page has only jquery included
[13:42:47] <caleb_smith> I'm having an issue where my $.ajax() call works in FF, chrome, ...., but not IE7. I've tried setting cache: False, but nothing seems to help. Basically IE7 hangs for about 5 minutes, and then everything works perfectly
[13:44:55] <xec-> phun-ky: that code looks a bit funky to me, if you have multiple libs you should do noconflict and use "jQuery" rather than "$"
[13:45:39] <xec-> phun-ky: the error you get is 99 times of a 100 caused by not including jquery lib (early enough)
[13:47:03] <xec-> caleb_smith: i don't have ie7 at hand, but if you have a demo, maybe someone can take a look
[13:47:23] <xec-> ?demo @ caleb_smith
[13:47:24] <bot-t> caleb_smith, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:50:35] <caleb_smith> thanks. I'll try to reproduce it in a fiddle
[13:59:55] <caleb_smith> I can't seem to get jsfiddle working (502 error on login). Here is a code paste though: http://dpaste.com/694099/
[14:00:43] <b1lly> is there a way to sort an array by its value numerically
[14:01:35] <chee> yes
[14:01:57] <chee> [4,7,1,8,2,9,3].sort()
[14:02:05] <chee> => [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
[14:02:30] <chee> oh i see you might not mean that
[14:04:56] <Advocated> Hi there, this is a bit of a random question, but im trying to do a onhover load div (which will contain a form for auto completing) ive got it working, it shows a div, but in theory should i be showing a dialog instead or does it really not matter?
[14:07:23] <unmgmt> any backbone users here? #document cloud was empty...
[14:07:58] <queuetip> hi, how in jquery would i make a double click function for any li inside of a ul that has a specific class ? does that make sense?
[14:08:27] <Eviltwin> Depends on whether or not it should apply to things added to that list later
[14:08:40] <Murof> queuetip: .dblclick() ?
[14:08:41] <Eviltwin> And whether the class is on the li or the ul
[14:08:52] <queuetip> Eviltwin: right now that list is ui sortable so things get removed and added yes
[14:09:03] <Murof> use live()
[14:09:06] <Eviltwin> No
[14:09:07] <Eviltwin> Never use .live
[14:09:08] <Eviltwin> Ever
[14:09:12] <Eviltwin> It's deprecated
[14:09:14] <queuetip> murof: might be what i need, thanks, i'll try
[14:09:19] <Murof> Evil: by what
[14:09:21] <Eviltwin> Use .on if you're using 1.7+ or .delegate if not
[14:09:27] <queuetip> i'm using 1.8
[14:09:36] <Murof> queue: so use the correct one
[14:09:43] <Tobbi> How do I find out whether an element was "just added" ? I do have a DOMNodeInserted handler and execute a function whenever an element is present (if $(myselector).length {}). However, that even bails when child elements were added to that element.
[14:09:48] <Murof> queue: if offers the same functionalitty
[14:09:55] <red_square> Eviltwin bot-t needs to listen out for the 'live' phrase
[14:10:08] <Eviltwin> red_square: Yes, yes it should
[14:10:19] <Murof> lol
[14:10:50] <queuetip> well i'll elaborate, i have a sortable list which in the ui library makes it really easy to drag from one container to another, and the genius using the little app wants to be able to double click each item in the ui list to accomplish the same thing, so yeah i'm hoping i can piggy back .dblclick() to accomplish this
[14:11:57] <chee> b1lly: a javascript q really. but .sort takes a function as an argument that tells it how to compare things
[14:12:05] <Murof> if there will be no new li element you dont need any of the bindings we gave you
[14:12:15] <Murof> just give them a common class
[14:12:20] <chee> so if you want to sort it ascendingyou can be all like
[14:12:31] <queuetip> Murof: that's what I was thinking too. thanks
[14:12:48] <Murof> queue: I thank you
[14:12:49] <chee> b1lly: var ascend = function(lol,bro) { return(lol-bro) }
[14:13:18] <chee> b1lly: and then be like, [1,11,12,2,3,4].sort(ascend);
[14:13:36] <red_square> queuetip pretty simple, so on dblclick just move the clicked li from ul1 to ul2
[14:14:42] <chee> (which will return [1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12] )
[14:14:44] <queuetip> red_square: yeah that's probably best case
[14:15:04] <queuetip> red_square: thanks i think i'll end up doing just that actually
[14:16:36] <Advocated> Hi there, this is a bit of a random question, but im trying to do a onhover load div (which will contain a form for auto completing) ive got it working, it shows a div, but in theory should i be showing a dialog instead or does it really not matter?
[14:17:08] <savid> Is there an event I can listen to for when a given selector is added to the dom?
[14:17:28] <savid> ie,  $('#some_element').on('created', function(){...})
[14:17:54] <Phrogz> savid: Not really; yes, there are DOM Mutation events, but not supported by IE, and going away in the future (*sniff*)
[14:18:14] <savid> ah, bummer.  ok.
[14:21:08] <nino_avel> hi
[14:21:19] <nino_avel> !list
[14:31:17] <Cork[home]> this is quite a bit of topic, but it feels like its one of those times; if you live in europ time to wake up and act http://www.avaaz.org/en/eu_save_the_internet_spread/?cJucGcb
[14:31:31] <jeffreylevesque> if i have <a href='/stuff/>link</a>.. how do I put an image tag around the text 'link'
[14:32:20] <jeffreylevesque> <a href='/stuff/ class='flag'>link</a> without modifying any of the anchor tag attributes
[14:33:03] <Cork[home]> jeffreylevesque: you can't put an image tag around anything
[14:33:28] <Cork[home]> jeffreylevesque: its a tag that can't hold text
[14:33:32] <jeffreylevesque> i know
[14:33:34] <jeffreylevesque> sorry
[14:33:39] <jeffreylevesque> i mean to replace the text
[14:33:41] <Cork[home]> ah
[14:33:42] <jeffreylevesque> with an image tag
[14:33:59] <jeffreylevesque> but the anchor tag has a bunch of things fed by the cms
[14:34:07] <jeffreylevesque> so i don't want to replace anything of the <a>
[14:34:20] <Cork[home]> $('a.flag').html('<img src="">');
[14:34:58] <jeffreylevesque> oh cool, does that get rid of the text? and is that a better choice than replaceWith()?
[14:35:14] <Cork[home]> replaceWith will replace the a tag
[14:35:25] <Cork[home]> html just replaces everything thats inside it
[14:35:59] <queuetip> so i have a ul with a dynamic list of li's, i did something like this: $("#myUL li").dblclick(function(data, object) { }); my question is, how can i tell now which id (the li that got clicked) was clicked ?
[14:36:27] <queuetip> i'm looking through the properties of data and event, but nothing looks obvious
[14:36:38] <jeffreylevesque> thanks Cork[home]
[14:36:40] <jeffreylevesque> Cork[home]++
[14:40:42] <Cork[home]> jeffreylevesque: np
[14:46:07] <galexcd> if a, and b, are functions, and I have $(document).ready(a).ready(b) is there any way function a can stop the execution of b?
[14:49:14] <xec-> galexcd: it might return false; or something, but i don't see why you would chain ready events like that?
[14:50:43] <xec-> galexcd: if you need to execute two functions on dom ready i would do: $(document).ready(function(){a();b();});
[14:50:52] <chovy> i've never seen .ready().ready()
[14:50:58] <galexcd> it was an example
[14:51:13] <ajpiano> galexcd: that's a dreadful way to approach that problem
[14:51:15] <chovy> do what xec- suggests
[14:51:16] <galexcd> i've got a large number of js files in this project and most of them require document.ready
[14:51:32] <chovy> $(function(){ a(); b(); });
[14:52:00] <galexcd> yeah alright
[14:52:02] <ajpiano> or if a needs to stop b, then $(function() { if ( a() ) { b() } });
[14:52:33] <galexcd> so you suggest keeping the functions in the other files global and calling them directly
[14:52:43] <galexcd> instead of a ready statement in each file?
[14:52:56] <xec-> galexcd: i think your example was too contrived - what is your current problem?
[14:53:05] <Eviltwin> $(function() { a() && b() });
[14:53:50] <Dave_Stein> If isn't a getter you can do : if ( a() ) { b() };
[14:53:57] <galexcd> My project has about 10 js files included, I'd like to keep the files as modular as possible so each one has a $(function(){ stuff here });
[14:54:01] <Dave_Stein> and just have it return true if you want b to run
[14:54:19] <galexcd> however I've recently found out that the first one that executes has a case that needs to stop execution of the application
[14:56:12] <Dave_Stein> random question: If JS is loaded in footer of site, is there any real reason to wait for document.ready to manipulate dom? just started killing my document.ready's on my site so ad code won't hang my sites ui
[14:57:17] <xec-> Dave_Stein: slapping <script>s at end of page is better performancewise afaik
[14:57:40] <xec-> which is basically exactly what you already stated :D
[14:57:46] <Dave_Stein> yeah
[14:57:50] <Dave_Stein> i havent had a chance to make the move for years
[14:58:01] <Dave_Stein> site was too big but now we're redoing piece by piece
[14:58:54] <Dave_Stein> i tweeted i was doing it and i think jorn made fun of me for not doing it sooner haha
[14:59:01] <Dave_Stein> "@Dave_Stein next up, the document.write calls?"
[14:59:36] <xec-> hehe
[15:02:49] <ProLoser|Work> does $().wrap() break bindings on the original el?
[15:03:04] <red_square> Dave_Stein no reason to use it all, i havnt for years
[15:04:19] <Dave_Stein> red_square: thought so
[15:05:46] <jeffreylevesque> i have a rather dumb question
[15:05:48] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	i was on dual screen
[15:05:50] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	and unplugged my mac
[15:05:51] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	i try to goto my photoshop window
[15:05:53] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	and it's wayy out left field
[15:05:55] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	where the dual screen was
[15:05:56] <jeffreylevesque> 	jeffreylevesque	how do i get that on this mac window lol
[15:06:31] <Dave_Stein> please don't spam like that + that has nothing to do with jquery + I use a PC
[15:07:14] <red_square> yeah, seriously
[15:08:00] <jeffreylevesque> sorry to have troubled you
[15:08:05] <thang> jeffreylevesque: there should be a key to show all windows... if youre on lion its launchpad i believ
[15:08:35] <jeffreylevesque> yeah i got the latest macbook pro
[15:09:04] <thang> um... f3 i think.
[15:10:39] <trepidacious> I've got an autocomplete input that works well, but I want it to hide the autocomplete popup when other code clears the input (on an ajax form submission)
[15:11:38] <trepidacious> otherwise if the user types something that autocompletes, then submits the value, they can end up with the autocomplete popup stuck, with nothing in the input. Worst case, the page has had content added, and the popup is even over the text box any more
[15:18:52] <joshualibrarian> If I am in a plugin... what is the real difference between using $(this).find('selector') and referencing directly with $('selector') ?
[15:20:50] <xec-> joshualibrarian: the latter will search the entire document
[15:21:33] <xec-> joshualibrarian: but the first one will only look inside whatever jquery collection is passed to the plugin
[15:22:05] <joshualibrarian> xec: I suppose what I'm trying to understand is wether that collection object is live and will change as the page changes.
[15:25:32] <xec-> joshualibrarian: i'm not 100% sure what you mean, but i think the answer is "not live"
[15:27:11] <xec-> joshualibrarian: as in, it will select what exists at this moment
[15:28:32] <joshualibrarian> xec:  as in even if other plugins are changing the document, $(this) is acting to point to a portion of the actual page, not as a reference, copied into that object.
[15:32:00] <xec-> joshualibrarian: "this" inside a plugin is a jquery collection... lets say... $('a').myPlugin()  <-- inside myPlugin this === $('a')
[15:32:03] <xec-> does that help?
[15:32:51] <xec-> "this" will be whatever jquery collection the plugin method was called on
[15:33:30] <joshualibrarian> I think I understand.
[15:35:37] <FunnyLookinHat> Is there a way to delay following an anchor link until after I've done some .load() stuff ?  I ajax in the content depending on the window.location.hash and want to scoll to the anchor tag after it's done loading
[15:35:39] <xec-> joshualibrarian: incidentally, that also means you don't need to wrap it, writing $(this) will be the same as saying $($('a'))
[15:37:48] <xec-> in any case, it's bedtime! good night from norway ;)
[15:48:16] <oojacoboo> anyone here familiar with uploadify?
[15:52:44] <Advocated> totally random, but does anyone know the name/location of this. ages ago I saw a jquery slider, basically it was a sliding buttons moving the content/divs, but the section that slid were grey boxes and within them had little square boxes with red crosses in. Anyone know? been looking for hrs..
[15:53:28] <jedimind> *blink*
[15:53:37] <jedimind> that rings zero bells
[15:54:32] <KWhat_Work> anyone know why $("#someId").trigger("autocompleteselect"); would not be triggering a select: fucntion() event
[15:55:08] <Advocated> jedimind, same :s i saw it about a year ago, bookedmarked it, pc died, and now its like 100% want im looking for lol
[16:00:13] <joshualibrarian> As I nest three functions deep, even with switch statements, my variables are going out of scope.  :(
[16:00:31] <oojacoboo> is there any easy way to unbind all children?
[16:02:11] <oojacoboo> $("#selector").find("*").off(); ?
[16:04:02] <KWhat_Work> i dont get it
[16:04:38] <oojacoboo> KWhat_Work: no quotes
[16:04:58] <Tobbi_> Can anyone tell me why $("html.js body.html-ltr div#content div#main article.main section#question div.side-section ul.system li.ff").text(); on https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/915831#answer-303500 returns "Firefox 9.0.1Firefox9.0.1" instead of Firefox 9.0.1 once'
[16:04:58] <oojacoboo> for a function
[16:05:01] <Tobbi_> ?
[16:05:28] <Tobbi_> Eh, shorten that.
[16:05:43] <Tobbi_>  $("#question div.side-section ul.system li.ff").text();
[16:06:14] <KWhat_Work> oojacoboo: no quote?
[16:06:25] <oojacoboo> ...
[16:06:31] <oojacoboo> quoteSSSSSS
[16:06:33] <oojacoboo> yes
[16:08:15] <KWhat_Work> my function isnt quoted and autocompleteselect is an event not a function
[16:08:50] <oojacoboo> in that case, you need to make a fiddle
[16:12:44] <KWhat_Work> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/U3Myj/
[16:15:24] <KWhat_Work> Anyone http://jsfiddle.net/U3Myj/ ?
[16:15:29] <oojacoboo> KWhat_Work: http://jsfiddle.net/U3Myj/1/
[16:16:19] <KWhat_Work> his.trigger is not a function
[16:16:51] <KWhat_Work> $(this).trigger doesnt work either
[16:19:09] <KWhat_Work> haha wow what i piece .bind( "autocompleteselect" works but select: fucntion() failes
[16:19:10] <oojacoboo> yea, I thought it was working, but that was just a generic autocomplete I guess
[16:19:43] <oojacoboo> KWhat_Work: the issue as I see it is you were creating another object
[16:19:49] <oojacoboo> you needed to bind it to that same object
[16:21:06] <oojacoboo> KWhat_Work: http://jsfiddle.net/U3Myj/2/
[16:21:10] <oojacoboo> something like that maybe
[16:21:40] <KWhat_Work> doesnt work etiher
[16:22:11] <KWhat_Work> for ex: http://jsfiddle.net/U3Myj/3/
[16:22:11] <oojacoboo> yea
[16:22:18] <moesti> hi, how can i detect the mime type from an file input?
[16:22:38] <KWhat_Work> moesti: that happens on upload, i dont think there is a way to do that in js
[16:23:01] <oojacoboo> moesti: use server side detection
[16:23:12] <oojacoboo> post get the mime type, handle, then post again
[16:23:38] <moesti> i used it
[16:23:46] <moesti> but now thinks change
[16:24:07] <moesti> i use a progressbar and have to run the process in an iframe
[16:24:29] <moesti> in this time the file cant be touch
[16:24:41] <moesti> because its uploading to the server...
[16:24:49] <oojacoboo> moesti: you didn't listen
[16:24:55] <oojacoboo> well
[16:24:57] <oojacoboo> kinda
[16:25:06] <oojacoboo> how large is the file?
[16:25:24] <moesti> 8mb
[16:25:40] <oojacoboo> why can't you just detect it by the extension of the file type
[16:25:41] <aghouseh> does anyone know why an attribute of an object would be available inside the object, but not when you call it?
[16:25:45] <oojacoboo> then process it all server side
[16:25:50] <oojacoboo> and return an error if need be
[16:25:53] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: Extensions aren't 1:1 with mime types
[16:26:01] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: yes, I know that
[16:26:01] <aghouseh> ie console.log(object); console.log(object.thumb); returns this http://i.imgur.com/KgPQi.png
[16:26:11] <oojacoboo> but close enough for most cases
[16:26:17] <Eviltwin> Really depends on the case
[16:26:25] <oojacoboo> yes, hence "most"
[16:26:28] <KWhat_Work> ehhh jquery really has alot of bugs
[16:26:33] <moesti> can i only detect it at the extension?
[16:26:52] <oojacoboo> moesti: you could write a lib
[16:26:55] <moesti> i mean with jquery
[16:26:56] <oojacoboo> or look for one
[16:27:10] <moesti> there is magic mime
[16:27:21] <moesti> but i think it only works with php
[16:27:29] <Eviltwin> Well
[16:27:45] <Eviltwin> MIME magic is a concept
[16:27:50] <Eviltwin> And it's a question of what implements it
[16:28:28] <oojacoboo> moesti: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4793046/mime-type-autodetection-of-js-file-fails-for-http-upload-in-firefox
[16:28:38] <oojacoboo> FF and Chrome
[16:28:46] <moesti> thanks
[16:30:15] <moesti> but im right when i say, i can check the mimetype on the server-side only when its completly upload to the server?
[16:30:25] <moesti> uploaded
[16:30:51] <oojacoboo> moesti: yes of course
[16:30:59] <moesti> :)
[16:38:25] <nicholasschulz> how do i make a textfield in focus when clicked button?
[16:38:37] <nicholasschulz> $(field).focus()?
[16:38:55] <oojacoboo> onClick event
[16:38:56] <oojacoboo> yea
[16:40:05] <oojacoboo> $("#button").click(function(event) { event.preventDefault; $(field).focus(); });
[16:40:18] <nicholasschulz> thanks
[16:46:25] <KWhat_Work> autocompleteselect is not fucking equal to select: event
[16:46:37] <KWhat_Work> period
[16:46:49] <oojacoboo> I was going to ask about that
[16:46:55] <oojacoboo> I have no idea on that ui event
[16:47:01] <oojacoboo> but it's listed on in the api docs
[16:47:17] <KWhat_Work> yah its undefined
[16:47:21] <KWhat_Work> but its listed there
[16:47:36] <KWhat_Work> someone needs to go back and revisit this widget using a brain
[16:47:42] <oojacoboo> just means it's not getting triggered prob
[16:48:11] <KWhat_Work> if you use bind autocompleteselect you have no idea what was selected
[16:48:44] <oojacoboo> KWhat_Work: use keyUp
[16:48:58] <oojacoboo> keyup()
[16:49:47] <KWhat_Work> still not passing in the ui, i think i need to trigger with that
[16:49:48] <oojacoboo> prob won't make a different
[16:49:51] <oojacoboo> difference*
[16:49:59] <KWhat_Work> well you know what i dont even need it
[16:50:07] <KWhat_Work> keyup acctaully works better for calling close
[16:50:52] <oojacoboo> anyway, g/l bbl
[16:51:01] <KWhat_Work> thanks
[16:51:01] <KWhat_Work> later
[16:58:44] <gaius65> Is there any way to attach an event handler on an iframe href change?
[17:00:15] <pifantastic> gaius65: hmm, I'm not sure. You can try onhashchange. And you can always poll for changes
[17:06:34] <pifantastic> gaius65: this is dumb, but it's a start: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/cy8GU/
[17:06:48] <gaius65> pifantastic: hmm... polling is quite ugly
[17:07:21] <pifantastic> gaius65: the onhashchange event isn't cross browser, and polling is the standard way of polyfilling it, this is a similar case
[17:07:29] <gaius65> pifantastic: this is not working at all, I get an iframe ahs changed every second :-/
[17:07:48] <gaius65> but I can see the idea ;)
[17:09:06] <gaius65> pifantastic: sry, you purposly chage the href every second...
[17:09:23] <keybo> i'm learning making regex but abit stuck - how would i specify that either a 1 or 2 digit integer from 0-9 is acceptable
[17:09:26] <keybo> please?
[17:10:11] <pifantastic> gaius65: yes, that's to demonstrate that it works
[17:10:24] <pifantastic> keybo: 1|2
[17:10:32] <gaius65> pifantastic: Yeah ;)
[17:10:33] <gaius65> pifantastic: Is there a more elegant way for waiting for the dom then iframe.onload = fn?
[17:10:45] <keybo> thank you :)
[17:11:06] <pifantastic> ?eval /1|2/.match(2);
[17:11:07] <bot-t> pifantastic: TypeError: /1|2/.match is not a function
[17:11:10] <pifantastic> lol
[17:12:56] <hays> any ideas why .transformNode wouldn't work in JQuery on an xml object in MSIE?
[17:13:27] <hays> the docs say that .ajax returns the correct object (i think)
[17:16:31] <joshualibrarian> #('#wrap') is null?  http://jsfiddle.net/zhb3c/6/
[17:18:13] <nicholasschulz> I want to do something when body is clicked but NOT <div id='someid'>… $(body).click(function(e){ if (e !== 'someId') { // DO SOMETHING}}); Shouldn't that work?
[17:18:18] <pifantastic> joshualibrarian: whatever defines t3sting is not being loaded in that fiddle
[17:18:39] <pifantastic> nicholasschulz: instead of `e`, use $(this).attr('id')
[17:18:55] <pifantastic> actually
[17:18:57] <pifantastic> you might want
[17:19:09] <pifantastic> $(e.target).attr('id') or something similar
[17:19:09] <fabiomcosta> e.target
[17:19:18] <pifantastic> yeah
[17:19:25] <nicholasschulz> Ok, thanks
[17:20:23] <keybo> mm it didnt work, how can I specify that anything after a 1 or 2 digit integer should fall outside the pattern?
[17:20:36] <joshualibrarian> pifantastic:  can I not use that same "plugin syntax" there in the fiddle?  In my code the plugin works, but the function can't be found on the instance.
[17:21:00] <keybo> i.e. a 1 or 2 digit number is fine but anything at all after the 1 or 2 digits would cause it to fail a pattern test
[17:22:44] <gaius65> Sry, I lost connection
[17:23:23] <keybo> tried this but it doesnt seem to work >> [0-9]{1,2}
[17:24:20] <gaius65> pifantastic: did you answer me?
[17:24:39] <gaius65> ... while I had lsot connection
[17:25:34] <fabiomcosta> keybo: [12]+ << like this?
[17:26:16] <keybo> ahh its ok i think i've done it >> [0-9]{1,2}(?!.) << seems to work
[17:26:52] <fabiomcosta> coo
[17:26:53] <fabiomcosta> l
[17:27:34] <keybo> regex is pretty interesting quite enjoying playing with it
[17:28:22] <robin_sz> so, if I have a <button> and want to disable it? errm its not $('#thing').disable() is it?
[17:28:31] <oojacoboo> keybo: wow, that's a first
[17:28:42] <keybo> lol how come?
[17:28:54] <oojacoboo> I don't know anyone that likes regex
[17:30:49] <robin_sz> oh  .. 	attr("disabled", "disabled"); OK, and to enable it again?
[17:30:55] <wpsmith> I am struggling to get my jquery to work on my site. http://dev.wpsmiththemes.com/sandbox/ I have the css being called (unoslider.css & theme.css) with the jquery (unoslider.js) and initiating it around line 132 (#unoslider); however, I don't know why it's not working???
[17:31:04] <oojacoboo> robin_sz: prop()
[17:31:07] <oojacoboo> not attr
[17:31:08] <keybo> lol making safe pattern validators is like a puzzle,i like puzzles ;p
[17:31:23] <robin_sz> prop?
[17:31:27] <oojacoboo> yes
[17:31:47] <oojacoboo> keybo: except the puzzle pieces each need to be referenced 100x
[17:32:04] <oojacoboo> nothing is intuitive with it
[17:32:09] <oojacoboo> it's all cryptic as hell
[17:32:12] <robin_sz> coo ...
[17:32:35] <robin_sz> is attr deprecated or someting?
[17:32:38] <oojacoboo> no
[17:32:50] <oojacoboo> it's to be used for attributes not properties
[17:33:03] <oojacoboo> it used to be hacked by the jquery core
[17:33:07] <keybo> maybe i'm just to new and i'll learn to hate it :P
[17:33:08] <oojacoboo> but that's been changed in 1.6?
[17:33:18] <keybo> too*
[17:33:54] <robin_sz> im on 1.4.4
[17:34:09] <oojacoboo> you need to upgradez your jqueriez
[17:34:19] <robin_sz> unlikely
[17:34:40] <keybo> wpsmith: you need to wrap your array in php tags firstly I think?
[17:35:03] <robin_sz> so with 1.4.4 use attr  and removeAttr?
[17:35:16] <oojacoboo> use prop
[17:35:26] <oojacoboo> pretty sure it's supported
[17:35:31] <oojacoboo> and prop
[17:35:38] <oojacoboo> - and prop
[17:36:35] <oojacoboo> robin_sz: http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[17:36:39] <robin_sz> theres no removeProp?
[17:36:44] <oojacoboo> read
[17:37:02] <robin_sz> i was already there
[17:37:12] <oojacoboo> I guess you have all the answers then
[17:37:40] <oojacoboo> there is no remove prop
[17:37:51] <oojacoboo> you just alter the value of the property
[17:37:54] <robin_sz> ?
[17:38:01] <robin_sz> http://api.jquery.com/removeProp/
[17:38:06] <robin_sz> turns out there is
[17:38:07] <oojacoboo> ha
[17:38:14] <oojacoboo> well, just alter the value
[17:38:15] <robin_sz> ok, thats easy then
[17:38:16] <oojacoboo> I wouldn't remove
[17:39:07] <robin_sz> so prop('disabled','disabled') and prop('disabled',null); ??
[17:39:08] <oojacoboo> $("input").prop("disabled", false);
[17:39:14] <robin_sz> false
[17:39:16] <robin_sz> righty
[17:39:18] <robin_sz> tyvm
[17:39:23] <oojacoboo> mm hmm
[17:39:37] <robin_sz> have 5 free internets
[17:44:22] <detaos> i'm using the jqueryui ... is there a way to remove the contents from a tab who's contents is fetched via ajax so it doesn't flash when going back to that tab?
[17:47:29] <robin_sz> right, no prop() in 1.4.4
[17:47:51] <oojacoboo> detaos: you could use .html()
[17:49:30] <detaos> oojacoboo: ok ... um ... where?
[17:50:14] <robin_sz> should I ever upgrade to 1.6+ I'll remember prop() though :)
[17:50:27] <oojacoboo> detaos: http://api.jquery.com/html/
[17:54:15] <felipe_Brz> what are the cases where a call to .html() to set a div's content might fail? I have a running app in which when I try to set the div's content with the word 'fail' it works, but any words greater in length than that then the text goes to the bottom of the container div.... what's happening here????
[17:55:18] <oojacoboo> felipe_Brz: sounds like a css prob
[17:55:44] <keybo> detaos, you want to empty a div when the tab is changed?
[17:56:26] <oojacoboo> you can use empty() too
[17:58:02] <detaos> keybo: yes, empty the tab contents after choosing another tab.
[17:58:20] <keybo> use empty() :P
[17:59:17] <keybo> post a paste of your current js and i'll see if i can help if you like
[18:00:11] <detaos> that'd be complicated ... it's spread over a bunch of files ... i just a way to trigger the empty().
[18:00:53] <oojacoboo> detaos: attach it to the click event then?
[18:01:10] <oojacoboo> so when you click a tab, it empty() the current or all other tabs
[18:01:13] <oojacoboo> then loads
[18:02:09] <detaos> sounds plausible ... though, what element do i call the .empty() on in the case of an ajax tab?
[18:03:06] <detaos> the relevant files: http://dpaste.com/694155/  http://dpaste.com/694156/
[18:03:49] <detaos> function edit_set(uid) in the first link contains the tab declaration.  the second file contains the tab html.
[18:10:07] <phdjsep> anyone here willing to help?
[18:10:23] <detaos> phdjsep: lots of people are ... just ask your question.
[18:11:49] <phdjsep> Great. I'm trying to do something simple and get an alert to popup onfocus of a field in a form. Ultimately I want to pair this with the slide fx to open up a div. Is this possible?
[18:13:53] <detaos> phdjsep: http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[18:14:57] <phdjsep> I've been trying that, but the alert isn't working for me
[18:18:06] <detaos> phdjsep: http://jsfiddle.net/AtGcD/
[18:19:49] <phdjsep> Thanks very much detaos!
[18:20:04] <phdjsep> I think I need to figure something out with Coda
[18:20:08] <detaos> phdjsep: np :)
[18:20:12] <phdjsep> it doesn't work in there
[18:20:29] <phdjsep> gotta catch the train. All the best
[18:22:00] <Guest32128> I have a page with three videos - one is shown at the start and other displayed with show/hide based on a link click. Is there a way to pause/stop a video when it is hidden?
[18:31:35] <gaius65> Sry, lost connection again
[18:32:02] <gaius65> Is there a more elegant way to wait for the iframe dom ready then iframe.onload=fn;?
[18:33:16] <LocalPCGuy> you could have a script in the iframe that has document.load(function(){parent.fn();}
[18:33:54] <aca20031> perhaps you could also use the onload of the <body> in side the iframe, not sure
[18:35:59] <LocalPCGuy> that make sense @gaius65?
[18:40:24] <gaius65> LocalPCGuy: I can't change the iframe code..
[18:41:29] <gaius65> aca20031: how can I get that? $($('#iframe').first().window).ready(fn)?
[18:54:43] <aca20031> [21:41:35] <gaius65> aca20031: how can I get that? $($('#iframe').first().window).ready(fn)?
[18:55:06] <aca20031> more like $('#iframe').find('body').first().ready(fn)
[18:55:46] <LocalPCGuy> you probably can't do that if it is cross-site
[18:56:33] <aca20031> maybe, but the iframe tends to literally add things to the current dom
[18:56:40] <aca20031> ive never done it, but its worth a try
[18:59:40] <LocalPCGuy> fairly sure that doesn't work if it is cross-site, but gauis65 doesn't seem to be responding anyways
[19:09:12] <blast_hardcheese> Man. I'm really stumped, I'd appreciate some help
[19:09:20] <ch3mical> blast_hardcheese: hit me
[19:09:26] <blast_hardcheese> ch3mical: http://blast.hardchee.se/~/files/2012-01-27/jquery-question.txt
[19:10:03] <blast_hardcheese> The problem is that the args to $.post() are whatever the last thing in the $.each() was
[19:10:50] <blast_hardcheese> I don't really know how to explain the problem I'm having, other than Javascript doesn't seem to support local function scope during function definition
[19:11:19] <blast_hardcheese> I would expect that a reference to a parent-scoped variable would create a copy of the value in the local scope
[19:11:29] <blast_hardcheese> (at least for function definition)
[19:11:34] <ch3mical> It's because you're reusing the same variable name
[19:11:55] <blast_hardcheese> I see.
[19:12:02] <blast_hardcheese> Half a second, I'll test
[19:12:06] <ch3mical> You're overwriting the variable from the outer scope with the inner scope. JavaScript doesn't have "protected" variable declarations
[19:12:38] <blast_hardcheese> Is this something that I should be frustrated by, or am I thinking about this incorrectly?
[19:12:57] <ch3mical> You just need to adjust the way you're thinking about it
[19:13:17] <blast_hardcheese> gotcha.
[19:14:59] <keybo> how come /(?<!.)[a-zA-Z](?!.)/ wont match just letters in a line
[19:15:13] <ch3mical> Also, remove your trailing comma from the buildtable object
[19:15:26] <ch3mical> keybo: are you trying to parse HTML?
[19:15:56] <blast_hardcheese> keybo: /(?<!.)[a-zA-Z]+(?!.)/ ?
[19:17:03] <blast_hardcheese> Negative lookbehind and lookahead would cause that to only match lines with only one letter on them
[19:17:10] <blast_hardcheese> at least if I'm reading that correctly
[19:17:28] <keybo> thanks hardcheese
[19:17:33] <blast_hardcheese> No prob
[19:17:37] <keybo> you are :) that little plus sign solved it
[19:17:48] <blast_hardcheese> Plus is "one or more match"
[19:17:55] <blast_hardcheese> * would also work if you wanted zero or more.
[19:22:17] <ch3mical> blast_hardcheese: your issue resolved?
[19:24:10] <blast_hardcheese> ch3mical: I'm trying to wrap my head around it, might still have more questions
[19:24:24] <blast_hardcheese> If you need to bail, feel free, thanks for the help so far
[19:24:35] <ch3mical> Naw, I just got here
[19:28:29] <coldhead> let the good times roll
[19:30:01] <abjorn> :o
[19:30:17] <abjorn> I DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD TIMES
[19:30:53] <detaos> abjorn: :(
[19:32:42] <tw2113> $('#abjorn').append('alcohol');
[19:35:37] * detaos agrees with tw2113
[19:41:32] <blast_hardcheese> ch3mical: Alright, I'm still completely lost.
[19:41:43] <blast_hardcheese> This is very frustrating.
[19:42:24] <blast_hardcheese> Here's the whole section I'm working on: http://blast.hardchee.se/~/files/2012-01-27/jquery-question.txt
[19:45:42] <blast_hardcheese> buildAttributeListTable sets up a .click that kicks off the wrapper function
[19:50:51] <blast_hardcheese> (Question is open to anyone else interested as well)
[19:51:05] <blast_hardcheese> this is really driving me up the wall, I'd love to know why this is the case.
[19:59:27] <blast_hardcheese> oh man.
[19:59:37] <blast_hardcheese> I think I figured it out, how ridiculous
[20:05:25] <taipres> I think jquery is taking over the planet :)
[20:05:54] <taipres> the little library that could

[20:19:56] <meltz> I'm trying to get a jquery event to be triggered
[20:20:13] <meltz> it's in a javascript file that is linked to from inside an iframe

[20:20:45] <meltz> any idea on why the event is not being triggered?
[20:21:37] <auzigog> Hey all. I'm trying to get an animation to slide over properly. I have a 100% width table and I need a fixed width "panel" to side out from the right. Two problems 1) i can only get it to half-work by starting it in an already expanded mode and clicking it twice. 2) the table "pops under" the new panel until the animation is done. Can anyone help? http://jsfiddle.net/z93se/14/
[20:39:15] <samol> hello, I got some problem with mouseEnter and mouseLeave events + animations. Im making my images bigger on hover, but when I move fast mouse over they're not coming back to the normal size. It looks like the animations were stopping each other. You can see this here: www.korpus-meble.pl  - then click Galeria on the bottom, pick the album and on the next screen there's my problem.
[20:55:06] <samol> any one?
[21:02:14] <oojacoboo> when trying to set a function parameter default, what's the best way about doing this?
[21:03:06] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming it can't be done like I would in php… function foo(bar = 1, call) {}
[21:03:33] <oojacoboo> I'm assuming I need to do something like var bar = bar || 1
[21:03:41] <oojacoboo> or something like that… or is there a better way?
[21:04:19] <oojacoboo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/894860/how-do-i-make-a-default-value-for-a-parameter-to-a-javascript-function
[21:04:33] <oojacoboo> I guess that's my best bet… love just solving my own problems
[22:50:02] <ch3mical> blast_hardcheese: sorry went AFK, back now though
[22:51:23] <ch3mical> Looks like you figured it out
[23:04:25] <aro> cam you use wildcards to removeClass()
[23:28:46] <rookie84> <li>One<ul><li>some</li><li>elements</li></ul></li>
[23:28:52] <rookie84> how can i get One ?
[23:29:23] <rookie84> $('li:contains("One")').text() returns the elements as well like the <ul> etc..
[23:29:30] <rookie84> how can i get just the text "One"
[23:29:31] <rookie84> possible?
[23:43:19] <josiah> rookie84, you're going to have to use some dom, but it's possible
[23:43:39] <rookie84> some dom?
[23:47:19] <skjas> hi all, new to jquery, need some help turning this scrolling marquee into a fade in/out
[23:47:20] <skjas> http://exscale.se/__files/uploads/scrolling-twitter-feed.htm
[23:47:20] <josiah> rookie84, $('li:contains("One")').eq(0).firstChild.textContent
[23:47:37] <rookie84> thats it, thanks josiah ! :)
[23:48:23] <josiah> skjas, have a look at the various slider plugins available for jquery
[23:48:31] <josiah> they'll probably do the job for you
