[02:09:05] <futzhu> hi everyone do you ever use datatable along with x-editable? i'm having an issue with pagination https://github.com/vitalets/x-editable/issues/326 but i'm not understand how to implement the fix to my code. i found it too hard for me. what come to my mind is using php foreach array result inside Jquery callback function. is that ok?
[02:15:52] <GoSox> whats the best way to check if an item exists? For example I want to run $("#ID").each( function ); but I want to make sure #ID exists because I'm sharing this javascript file across a few different pages
[02:22:25] <pavonia> You can check the .length property for the number of query results
[02:22:47] <GoSox> hmmm
[02:23:06] <GoSox> it seems to be failling quietly so i might not need to do anything
[02:23:16] <GoSox> it "feels" wrong not to check first but meh, working is working I guess
[02:23:37] <pavonia> What fails quietly?
[02:23:48] <GoSox> performing actions on non-existant IDs
[02:24:11] <GoSox> not even a warning in the console which is weird
[02:25:43] <pavonia> If you mean the .each(), it performs this on each element in the set. For an empty set this mean nothing to do at all
[02:26:31] <GoSox> i have that, and i have some .submit() and .click() events on sometimes-existant IDs
[02:26:36] <GoSox> everything just works
[02:29:24] <Cork> GoSox: .each on an id is pointless as it can't ever be more then one match
[02:30:06] <GoSox> yes it's actually a class, i was just using ("#ID") as the shortest-character example
[02:30:30] <Cork> and also jquery was built to not crash cause a selector wasn't found
[02:30:39] <Cork> so ya, you normally don't need to check for it
[02:30:45] <GoSox> well thats great for these two pages i just merged into one
[02:35:27] <GoSox> aw found one tiny little bug, so i do have to wrap the .each in a check, otherwise it does none of the 'meat', but then tries to do the post processing cleanup when it didn't acutally do anything
[02:35:29] <GoSox> no biggie though
[02:36:21] <GoSox> so $(".class").length will always equal the numebr of items of that class on the page, including 0 if there are none?
[02:36:25] <Cork> GoSox: remember to not run the selector multiple times though
[02:36:33] <GoSox> what do you mean?
[02:37:14] <Cork> GoSox: var var targets = $('.class'); if(targets.length > 0) { targets.each(function() { }) }
[02:37:28] <Cork> as $() makes a dom query and depending on your selector can be costly
[02:37:54] <GoSox> oh, well this is a one time thing and the query is just a direct reference to a specific class, so that shouldn't matter in this case, yeah?
[02:38:14] <Cork> i would still do it that way
[02:38:21] <Cork> but you are free to do how you like
[02:38:23] <GoSox> if it matters, there will be from zero to maybe 20 items of .class on the page
[02:38:34] <Cork> that doesn't matter
[02:38:40] <GoSox> what DOES matter?
[02:38:48] <Cork> how much of the page needs to be search
[02:38:49] <GoSox> like what would cause it to run slowly?
[02:38:58] <Cork> so the size of the page and how costly the selector is
[02:39:16] <Cork> number of matches is just memory not really speed
[02:39:40] <GoSox> these pages are about 10 KB uncompressed, maybe a little more, sometimes a little less
[02:39:55] <Cork> that isn
[02:40:01] <Cork> isn't the size i talked about
[02:40:18] <GoSox> the size of the page?
[02:40:21] <Cork> you should not think about a page in the term of kb or lines or characters
[02:40:36] <Cork> but how many elements you create in it (and how many event handlers you have)
[02:40:42] <Cork> cause THAT is what matters
[02:42:28] <GoSox> hmmmm
[02:42:52] <GoSox> are you specifically talking about elements created in javascript, or ALL elements on the entire document?
[02:43:48] <Cork> all
[02:44:00] <Cork> original elements + elements created with javascript
[02:44:00] <GoSox> how does one even count something like that?
[02:44:17] <GoSox> and how would you know 'a lot' from 'not very many'?
[02:44:23] <Cork> well you could get fairly close with $('*'=).length
[02:44:39] <Cork> GoSox: you don't really
[02:44:57] <Cork> you should just think about what you do in your code so it isn't wasteful
[02:45:05] <Cork> * well you could get fairly close with $('*').length
[02:46:03] <GoSox> does using $(this) inside event handlers instead of $("#ID") have the same advantage?
[02:46:23] <Cork> yes, as it just wraps a dom element in jquery
[02:46:39] <Cork> this isn't anything other then a variable pointing to a raw dom element
[02:47:12] <Cork> (though you don't want to wrap this in jquery too many time, cause of gc)
[02:47:22] <Cork> so again store the result
[02:58:12] <GoSox> the more i think about these two files i merged, they literally have one command in common, all the rest is unique. i'm not sure why i'm so hell bent on merging them into one file
[02:59:00] <Cork> GoSox: is the difference in selectors or are they doing different things all together?
[02:59:23] <Cork> meaning can you make them share code by generalizing it
[02:59:41] <Cork> if not, then ya little point in doing it
[02:59:51] <GoSox> most of the code is just GUI stuff, disable this button, enable that button. The core funcionality is similar, but different and simple enough that it doesn't make sense to re-write in a shareable way, i'd end up with longer code than what i have now
[03:00:06] <GoSox> my main goal was organization at the filesystem level on my server
[03:00:13] <GoSox> and this does achieve that
[03:01:06] <Cork> ya, but for example
[03:01:08] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function() { $('#form-id-submit').prop('disabled', true'); });
[03:01:13] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function() { $('#form-other-submit').prop('disabled', true'); });
[03:01:18] <Cork> are unique
[03:01:23] <Cork> but if you instead do $('form
[03:01:25] <Cork> opps
[03:02:01] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function() { $(this).find('[type="submit]').prop('disabled', true); }); it isn't
[03:02:22] <Cork> so don't think just cause it is ui it can't be shared
[03:02:55] <GoSox> they're not two forms though, one is a form, one is essentially a list of DIVs
[03:03:16] <Cork> it was just an example
[03:03:21] <GoSox> i hear you
[03:03:38] <GoSox> i'm sure there are ways to share some of this and shorten it a big, but nothing huge
[03:03:49] <Cork> but ya, if they are widely different there isn't a point in merging them
[03:04:14] <Cork> it would just make the page consume more memory and be slower
[03:04:41] <GoSox> i did some fun stuff on my unit converter page and go the same small block of javascript powering like a dozen different forms on the page since all forms have the same structure and behavior
[03:12:19] <GoSox> ok i'm calling it done
[03:12:46] <GoSox> next time i revisit my javascript, i'll see if i can't clean it up some more. or maybe ill just break it down into two pages again
[05:09:54] <yeeve> hey chat, I wanted a nice/clean solution to attach my plugins to both old and new HTML (I'm adding new forms to the page via JS). I've got this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1589c4c3584e3f2ba2a1cc21184371c6 but the issue is that the plugins to activate until I click into the field. Is it possible to have it run once it "finds"/"loads" the HTML?
[05:11:18] <Cork> yeeve: use named function and run them in an each loop
[05:11:45] <Cork> it won't help for when things are appended though
[05:12:00] <Cork> there isn't a solution for that except have a function you call after adding the form
[05:12:53] <yeeve> Ok Cork that'll probably do :) is it worth having a custom event + listener? maybe one for each plugin or is that overkill for no real benefit?
[05:14:44] <yeeve> Ah it's probably overkill, I'll keep it simple. Thanks Cork
[05:21:07] <Cork> yeeve: you normally don't want event handlers if you don't need them
[05:21:21] <Cork> and if it isn't event related i would say it falls in that category :)
[05:21:59] <yeeve> I'll bare that in mind üëç cheers Cork
[05:28:06] <MarkusDBX> Hi, I'm looking for a nice multi-step form library/example for jquery, any ideas what I should google?
[05:28:32] <MarkusDBX> history.js (pushstate) for the form handler would be cool too.
[06:35:04] <BulleTime> hi
[06:35:20] <BulleTime> anyone using the GSAP animation library?
[06:35:33] <BulleTime> is there any irc channel for it, or could i ask around inhere?
[06:56:03] <Cork> BulleTime: they appear to be a forum only community https://greensock.com/forums/
[06:56:53] <BulleTime> yeah indeed
[07:43:43] <Anticom> Hi all. When writing plugins where you can specify optional jquery references in the plugin's options, would you rather: a) null-check (etc.) every time you're trying to call methods on it or b) just default it to an "empty" jquery reference of some sort (- is $() a thing??? -) ?
[07:44:42] <Cork> Anticom: i would recommend just requiring the site to load jquery and in the documentation provide examples of how to do it
[07:45:17] <Anticom> Cork: think you've missed my point :/
[07:45:24] <Cork> Anticom: libs that are too "convenient" usually are cumbersome to handle
[07:46:03] <Cork> Anticom: not really, cause with the solution i meant you wouldn't need this at all
[07:46:20] <Anticom> $('any-element').myAwesomePlugin({ /*now this is an optional jq ref*/ $errorField }) <--- if $errorField is left out, can i initialize it (using $.extend) to just `$()` ?
[07:47:31] <Cork> you could do $.extend({ /* defaults */}, options)
[07:47:43] <Cork> it would return the resulting options
[07:48:01] <Cork> (meaning var optionsWithDefaults = $.extend({ /* defaults */}, options))
[07:48:26] <Cork> $() doesn't have anything to handle objects in this manner
[07:49:18] <Anticom> Cork: the issue is, that i'm currently $.extend'ing $errorField to null and then later in the plugin call jq methods on it
[07:49:28] <Anticom> and i'd like to have some kind of NullObject pattern
[07:49:37] <Anticom> so i don't need to null-check in like 10000 places
[07:49:51] <Cork> why do you call jquery methods on an option object?
[07:50:20] <Cork> just provide defaults that won't fails if used
[07:50:25] <Anticom> Cork: it's a validation plugin. As the option name $errorField suggests it's an optional reference to where to display the error messages if any
[07:50:43] <Cork> ya, i get the optional option object
[07:50:43] <Anticom> Cork: that's why i was asking, whether $.extend'ing it to $() is okay to do
[07:50:55] <Cork> but not why you would call options.each or something like that
[07:51:15] <Anticom> i'm not doing that
[07:51:23] <Anticom> why would i iterate over the options? :O
[07:51:24] <Cork> uh... it is what you're saying...
[07:51:30] <Anticom> Cork:
[07:51:31] <Anticom> sec
[07:52:10] <Anticom> Cork: can i pm you?
[07:52:22] <Cork> why for?
[07:52:27] <Anticom> Cork: company code
[07:52:35] <Anticom> don't want to post gist in public channel
[07:52:39] <Cork> ok
[07:52:42] <Anticom> cheers
[08:47:50] <hellyeah> hey
[08:47:59] <hellyeah> i try to change the title of dialog i did that $(".dialog").dialog('option', 'title', 'New Title'
[08:47:59] <hellyeah>   
[08:47:59] <hellyeah>   );
[08:48:07] <hellyeah> but that doesnt work on browser
[08:48:11] <hellyeah> any other suggestion
[08:53:52] <Cork> hellyeah: wfm https://jsfiddle.net/6f127rpt/
[08:54:12] <hellyeah> wfm?
[08:54:20] <Cork> Works Form Me
[08:54:26] <Cork> *For*
[08:56:18] <hellyeah> guess problem is about jquery version
[08:56:25] <Cork> no
[08:56:39] <Cork> i've run the same code with jquery since pre 1.3 time
[08:57:30] <hellyeah> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[08:57:38] <hellyeah> jquery 3.1.1
[08:57:41] <Cork> you didn't call .dialog()
[08:57:53] <Cork> you can't set option on it before you have created it
[08:58:09] <hellyeah> check the console https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/r99m236o/56/
[08:59:02] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/r99m236o/57/
[08:59:12] <Cork> again, you haven't initiated it
[08:59:19] <hellyeah> it may be my fault
[08:59:21] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:59:53] <hellyeah> humm
[08:59:54] <Cork> before you can call methods on dialog (dialog('something')) you have to call dialog({})
[09:00:01] <hellyeah> i see
[09:00:03] <Cork> to create the dialog
[09:00:16] <Cork> {} isn't needed, you only need it if you want to pass options to it
[09:00:54] <Cork> like .dialog({ modal: true })
[09:01:30] <hellyeah> i used dialog before but i didnt touch for a while.
[09:01:34] <hellyeah> thanks for reminding me
[09:16:17] <hellyeah> what da
[09:16:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:17:10] <hellyeah> anyway
[09:19:41] <hellyeah> how can i cut some part of string. Is there a method for that?
[09:21:26] <hellyeah> or
[09:21:35] <hellyeah> is there a method for split string
[09:21:42] <hellyeah> that makes more sense
[09:25:46] <Cork> hellyeah: .split for splitting and substr or substring for cutting a part of it
[09:26:38] <Cork> hellyeah: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Methods_2
[09:27:20] <hellyeah> thanks Cork
[09:39:13] <hellyeah> how can i get key side of object?
[09:39:25] <hellyeah> Object.keys(obj) will give that to me?
[09:39:38] <Cork> yes
[09:39:48] <Cork> or you can use $.each(obj, function(key, value) {})
[09:39:55] <Cork> depending on what you want to do with it
[09:40:05] <hellyeah> yeah
[09:40:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:41:01] <hellyeah> i just have an object with key such as div0 and lots of buttons, id of that buttons are likt div0, div1, div2 i just want to get appropriate content when you click button
[09:43:08] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/r99m236o/59/ line 171
[09:43:50] <Cork> you mean from objExplain ?
[09:44:19] <Cork> why do you have it wrapped in an array?
[09:46:07] <hellyeah> hmm well i have more indexes
[09:46:21] <hellyeah> like 10 or something. Ten more objects
[09:46:35] <Cork> ya, but if it per button it should be { 'div0': [] } if anything
[09:47:12] <Cork> else you would have to loop all the objects hunting for objects with the key
[09:47:41] <hellyeah> Cork,  seems like that i mean else part seems more what i want to do
[09:47:51] <hellyeah> if you have another suggestion pls tell me
[09:47:58] <Cork> i just did
[09:48:22] <hellyeah> can you tell me again my english is not really good
[09:49:08] <Cork> if you want to store multiple values per button i would use the format { div0: { title: 'some title' } } for example
[09:49:27] <Cork> then you can just use objExplain[this.id].title
[09:49:39] <Cork> to access the title for that button (for example)
[09:52:49] <hellyeah> understand now
[09:53:23] <hellyeah> obj inside obj instead of obj inside array right?
[09:53:28] <Cork> yes
[09:53:44] <hellyeah> got it
[10:18:55] <evanesoteric> Is there a solution to collapse the Bootstrap navbar, each time a nav li a is clicked?  My solution causes issues on non-collapsed navbars.
[10:19:21] <Cork> prob better directed to the bootstrap channel
[10:19:45] <codecutter> jqgrid question, how do i get the value of "customer id"  and set it in the url at line 78? https://pastebin.com/egYNY4f6
[10:19:55] <Cork> evanesoteric: => ##bootstrap
[10:20:24] <codecutter> url would look like tp://localhost:8080/test?id={customer_id}"
[10:21:36] <codecutter> this answer seems related but not sure how it works - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3176157/sending-additional-parameters-to-editurl-on-jqgrid
[10:22:49] <codecutter> Cork: be a good chap and help me out, will ya!
[10:23:16] <Cork> heh, haven't used jqgrid since i found it didn't do what i needed close to 10 years ago
[10:23:21] <Cork> can't really give you much help
[10:23:51] <codecutter> oh, well...
[10:24:22] <Cork> i'm not even sure you can use a static string there to do this
[10:24:30] <Cork> but this is very jqgrid specific question
[10:24:42] <Cork> so can't use generic jquery info to help
[10:25:13] <codecutter> you can pass a 'url' option
[10:25:55] <codecutter> i just don't know how to get the id field field from the selected row
[10:26:19] <Cork> that is what i meant
[10:26:32] <codecutter> http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:form_editing
[10:26:48] <Cork> i'm not sure there is a built in solution to get info from where you are into the string automatically
[10:27:42] <Cork> and the docks doesn't provide much info about it either
[10:27:53] <codecutter> i know...
[10:28:26] <Cork> best option might be to grab an unminified version of jqgrid and search through its code for places touching the url option in question
[10:28:32] <Cork> and from there find what it does with it
[11:32:20] <kegster> if i want to create a logo maker type tool -- is there a drag/drop tool creation (text, shapes, etc) that is in place to help out with this so it doesn't need to be completely custom?
[11:32:44] <kegster> sort of like a sign maker and i want to keep track of the lettering, and allow the user to create elements but ALSO have the tool create elements for user (like borders/stroke, etc)
[11:32:55] <Cork> not really
[11:33:34] <Cork> you might want to have a look at rapha√´l
[11:33:43] <Cork> or d3.js
[11:33:52] <kegster> was that for me?
[11:34:01] <kegster> ive looked at d3 so i think so :)
[11:34:08] <Cork> its libs to make it easy to create and modify svg elements
[11:34:11] <kegster> the drag/drop creation like a logo maker tool
[11:34:12] <kegster> hmm
[11:34:30] <Cork> i don't think you will find a complete lib for what you want
[11:34:58] <Cork> there are plenty of building blocks out there though
[11:35:06] <kegster> oh yeah
[11:35:09] <kegster> i saw d3-drag as well
[11:36:05] <kegster> womp womp womp haha

[12:14:43] <evanesoteric> Hello, can anyone advise me on how to form this statement?  https://hastebin.com/akahewihow.js
[12:15:03] <evanesoteric> How to wrap that function properly in the document tags.
[12:20:40] <robertmaxrees> evanesoteric huh?
[12:20:45] <robertmaxrees> you mean run in on document ready?
[12:21:48] <evanesoteric> I want to place the function in a seperate js file. I am unsure how to tag the document. I guess document.ready wouldn't be desired.
[12:22:00] <robertmaxrees> "tag the document"?
[12:24:16] <robertmaxrees> evanesoteric could you maybe back up and try to clarify?
[12:26:20] <evanesoteric> Hi, I would like to place this javascript into its own file. How do I need to start and end the document? Or will this work standalone? https://hastebin.com/eforopobub.lisp
[12:35:13] <robertmaxrees> That would work on its own.
[12:35:40] <robertmaxrees> fwiw when you say "document" w/r/t web dev they thing you mean the html.
[12:35:43] <robertmaxrees> *think
[12:42:57] <hellyeah> hey
[12:43:00] <robertmaxrees> sup
[12:43:07] <hellyeah> not much

[12:57:28] <hellyeah> which script
[12:57:29] <hellyeah> ?
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> something is way broken there.
[12:57:39] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  it isnt windows.load?
[12:57:54] <hellyeah> i just want to show popup after page load
[12:58:08] <robertmaxrees> page load or document ready?
[12:58:12] <taplar> 3X separated the binding from load() didn't it?
[12:58:34] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[12:58:45] <taplar> load(function) used to act like on(load)
[12:58:52] <taplar> but 3x stopped that i believe
[12:59:02] <taplar> you have to use on('load') if that is your intention
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:59:34] <hellyeah> $(window).on('load', function
[12:59:36] <hellyeah> is it?
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> you want window.load
[12:59:53] <robertmaxrees> .on('load') can trigger a race iirc.
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/x3jLthqp/ this errors.
[13:00:22] <robertmaxrees> ah nvm taplar is right.
[13:00:24] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/load/  <-- the yellow block is what i'm referring to
[13:00:24] <robertmaxrees> it's a shortcut.
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/OHbV5JG.png not even a thing any more
[13:02:22] <hellyeah> is that what you meant? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/r99m236o/73/
[13:02:48] <hellyeah> it didnt open
[13:03:01] <taplar> if the load event already happened, it wouldn't
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> try it on your site.
[13:03:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of jsfiddle.
[13:04:40] * taplar listens as the crazies begin
[13:07:01] <hellyeah> what is the problem in jsfiddle?
[13:08:18] <taplar> it's a page with iframes
[13:08:37] <taplar> the window quite possibly may have already loaded before the iframes do
[13:09:29] <hellyeah> so you said it will work in your loca?
[13:09:31] <hellyeah> local
[13:09:58] <taplar> i don't know if he tried it.  he just suggested you try it
[13:12:51] <hellyeah> okay
[14:42:38] <chrisml> i'm pretty sure you can do $('.foo').eq(n).find(...) can't you, as eq() returns a jq obj
[14:42:59] <taplar> yep
[14:44:08] <chrisml> thought so
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/sc0rmpvc/ aye
[14:44:51] <chrisml> :)
[15:20:05] <aro> are there any good plugins for generating tables? i want a horizontal scrolling table, where i can add sequential columns
[15:22:00] <taplar> you could possibly accomplish that with just css
[15:22:42] <MassDebates> <3 taplar
[15:24:14] <aro> whats that
[15:24:56] <taplar> css?
[16:05:22] <alexidoia> Hi there, I can't manage to do a simple thing (a body.scrollTop(50)) on a trigger event. Can someone have a quick look and let me know ?
[16:09:02] <alexidoia> this is quite frustrating, my url is http://stephanie-cazaentre.com/category/collaborations/ when clicking on a image it display a div, when closing that div I'd like to keep the same scroll value I had before clicking on the image, my script is mains.js I collect the scroll on line 75 when I click on a image to display the div and I try to set the scroll on line 94 precisely when I close the div
[16:12:19] <robertmaxrees> alexidoia can you show us the particular code in question?
[16:13:07] <NoiseEee> alexidoia: your links are going to #;  you need to stop the event, otherwise # will scroll you to the top of the page.   once you stop the event, you won't even need/care about scroll position
[16:13:39] <robertmaxrees> $("a.displaySingle").click(function() { -> $("a.displaySingle").click(function(e) {
[16:13:49] <robertmaxrees> then e.preventDefault(); as the first line in there.
[16:13:52] <alexidoia> NoiseEee: I understand, how should I stop the event ?
[16:14:14] <gambl0re> parle vous francais?
[16:15:11] <robertmaxrees> alexidoia i just showed you how :)
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> alexidoia https://bpaste.net/show/f601044ab56e
[16:15:42] <gambl0re> hi robert, hows going?
[16:15:43] <alexidoia> robertmaxrees: ah thanks
[16:15:50] <robertmaxrees> yo
[16:15:59] <gambl0re> hows going?
[16:16:10] <robertmaxrees> it goes
[16:19:06] <alexidoia> There must be something I do wrong. With an alert I am able to check I did memorise the scroll correctly but then when I use $("html,body").scrollTop(myScroll); it does not change my scroll
[16:19:36] <alexidoia> I try to prevent the initial even # but it does not change a thing
[16:20:20] <robertmaxrees> alexidoia you're missing the preventDefault
[16:20:28] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/f601044ab56e
[16:20:43] <robertmaxrees> first line after that displaySingle should be preventDefault.
[16:20:51] <robertmaxrees> do the same change to closeSinge and nextSingle
[16:21:02] <robertmaxrees> and previous, actually.
[16:21:32] <alexidoia> Thanks a lot !!!
[17:18:45] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re if you have questions, you can just ask here duder.  no need to pm me.
[17:19:29] <gambl0re> do you know node.js or express
[17:19:59] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do.  probably have more luck in #Node.js for that.
[17:20:17] <gambl0re> but do you know?
[17:20:20] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:20:27] <robertmaxrees> i've worked with it plenty.
[17:22:51] <gambl0re> why did you join node.js...haha
[17:33:11] <robertmaxrees> was making sure i got the room name right.
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> don't like directing people to the wrong place.
[18:51:16] <taplar> How many astro physicists does it take to replace a time piece?
[18:51:59] <robertmaxrees> I dunno, how many?
[18:52:07] <taplar> It's relative
[18:54:25] * robertmaxrees rimshots
[19:20:01] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[19:20:21] <goodenough> trying to create a site footer with links
[19:20:36] <goodenough> that when you click one of the links, it takes you to a new page
[19:20:43] <goodenough> but the footer doesn't refresh
[19:20:51] <goodenough> with the page, and its sticky
[19:21:12] <goodenough> Only solution i found is pjax barba.js
[19:22:17] <goodenough> anyone had a similar problem? creating a peristent footer
[19:32:09] <robertmaxrees> goodenough so you want to ajax in the main site content?
[19:32:48] <goodenough> Well that's the only way for this to happen I guess
[19:32:57] <goodenough> other way im thinking is iframes
[19:33:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid iframes.
[19:33:07] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that?
[19:33:10] <goodenough> but its pretty buggy on iphones
[19:33:59] <goodenough> Its a little cleaner, because the script file is pretty long, and I gotta reinitiate everything on a page change
[19:34:20] <goodenough> Forget I asked, I think ajax is the only way
[19:38:29] <robertmaxrees> how long?
[19:38:58] <goodenough> 2000 lines
[19:39:00] <goodenough> its not that bad
[19:39:10] <goodenough> it just changes the site dna, you know
[19:40:01] <goodenough> everything is ajax, instead of a normal site changes on link clicks
[19:51:27] <drej> i mean its a pretty basic SPA pattern
[19:51:37] <drej> persistent nav and dynamic content
[19:51:51] <drej> whats the problem exactly? are you using a SPA framework?
[19:51:51] <drej> like react or angular or something?
[19:53:34] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe it should but isn't.
[20:46:39] <cannap> it is
