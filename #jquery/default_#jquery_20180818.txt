[00:23:01] <Lenswipee> Hi, how to get the inner $(this) as it is referring to the outer $(this): $('foo').each(function(){ $('bar').filter(function(){ $(this); }); });
[00:26:54] <pavonia> function(i, elem) { $(elem) } should work
[00:33:18] <Lenswipee> what is the `i` mean?
[00:35:50] <pavonia> index
[04:32:06] <QuantumToronto> http://jsfiddle.net/ufybkxas/1/
[04:32:10] <QuantumToronto> this makes me crazy
[04:32:22] <QuantumToronto> the second click is never called at all but i remove the class
[04:32:29] <QuantumToronto> and add clicked
[04:42:14] <pavonia> QuantumToronto: Handlers are only added for elements that match the selector at the time the command is called. So your second handler isn't ever added
[04:42:55] <pavonia> You could add a general click handler and check inside the handler if .clicked or .normal is set
[04:48:07] <QuantumToronto> ah ok thank you fpr that info. makes sense
[04:54:35] <QuantumToronto> hmm problem is inside i would set clicked and the check after wil lalways be true. my main goal is just to fade opacity to 0.3 on klick and ond second klick back to 100
[04:55:02] <QuantumToronto> mybe i am completely lokking the wrong way
[05:04:07] <pavonia> You check the class first, do the animation, and then toggle the class
[05:04:23] <pavonia> There already is .toggleClass(), btw
[05:04:38] <pavonia> Also .fadeTo() for the opacity
[05:05:25] <QuantumToronto> i have seen fadeTo yes. i thought animating the property would be better to read
[05:19:44] <Rockwood> something like isset in jquery?
[05:25:21] <pavonia> What does that do exactly?
[06:06:31] <ZeroWalker> is there some golden rule what work should be done on the server vs on the client. I was thinking to only do what had to be done more or less on the server and let the client handle all the real work.
[06:06:52] <ZeroWalker> client being javascript, and much jquery in my case
[06:27:14] <Lenswipee> hi, how to make dialog open not on top of each other? thanks
[06:48:50] <Lenswipee> position: {my: "top", at: 'top+"{$offset}"' } <-- problem with my syntax.
[10:49:27] <sine0> spaces: thats awesome lol
[10:49:45] <sine0> I saw a magazine in whsmiths for webdesign and it had some tute on using three.js i think
[10:49:53] <sine0> looked like that. would have bought it but im too tight
