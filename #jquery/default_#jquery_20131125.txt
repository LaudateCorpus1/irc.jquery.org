[00:01:21] <Cork> iaj: $(document).on('submit', 'form', function() { $(this).find('input[type="submit"], button[type="submit"]').prop('disabled', true); });
[00:02:10] <iaj> Cork: awesome thanks man
[00:06:29] <lemonsparrow> pls help me fix this string colon issue : http://pastebin.com/jPrBE1Q0
[00:08:22] <ravenzz> iaj are you submitting the form with ajax?
[00:12:27] <iaj> ravenzz: nah.. simple html
[00:16:33] <jozefk> I found a simple jquery code for hide and toggle and it works, but the problem is that the link points to "#" so if I click on link to show the content of the paragraph, content shows but the browser jumps age jumps on top of the page. anybody with suggestion what to use or to do to get this easily working?
[00:18:41] <Brianna1016> Hi :) I have a select menu with multiple selections possible. How can I use jquery to automatically select more than one item and refresh?? http://jsfiddle.net/G34jD/
[00:19:40] <Cork> jozefk: how are you calling the code?
[00:19:50] <monk3y> jozefk: http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[00:20:18] <Cork> jozefk: basically if your using a tags with href="#" your adding broken links to the page
[00:20:28] <Cork> and you should prob change it to something else
[00:20:39] <jozefk> yes it is href=
[00:20:44] <jozefk> href="#"
[00:21:05] <Cork> jozefk: yes you said that, but how is the code your using executed
[00:21:20] <Cork> can you replace the <a href="#"> element without breaking the code?
[00:21:59] <jnewt> i have a form which contains two tables where a user can dynamically add and populate rows with data.  i'd like to send those portions of the form as an array or even the whole thing as JSON would be ok.
[00:22:01] <jozefk> I don't really need those links. is it possible to make it working with h2 tags instead of <a>?
[00:22:04] <Cork> semantically correct would be <button> with styling to make it look the way you want
[00:22:19] <Cork> jozefk: depends on the code, but most likely yes
[00:22:50] <jnewt> i can't find any examples of serializing or building up data for submit that is more complex than serialize can handle.
[00:22:56] <jozefk> this is the code I found and I'm using: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15288790/show-hide-script-using-javascript
[00:23:09] <jozefk> top answer but the jquery suggestion, not the javascript
[00:23:33] <Cork> jozefk: ugg
[00:23:51] <jozefk> :)
[00:23:57] <jnewt> since it's a table, and dynamic, i don't want to name and id each row, i'd rather just get it serverside as one structure and parse it there.
[00:24:03] <Cork> jozefk: could you jsfiddle an example of what your doing?
[00:24:22] <jnewt> much less each cell :(
[00:24:25] <Cork> jozefk: and that so link is a really bad example of how you should not do it...
[00:24:59] <Cork> jnewt: so you wqant to send the content of the table or do you have form fields in there?
[00:25:18] <Cork> *you want to send
[00:25:24] <jozefk> do you want me to create a jsfiddle for jquery or to give you the link for that javascript jsfiddle which is already available?
[00:25:40] <Cork> jozefk: either works
[00:25:48] <jozefk> http://jsfiddle.net/think123/FqqhY/
[00:25:52] <Cork> as long as it has the html
[00:26:24] <jnewt> Cork: both.  pre-existing values (if it's an update) are not in <input> / <select>, but ones where they've clicked an edit button or new ones are in std form fields (althogh not named.)
[00:26:38] <jozefk> that's what I need to achieve but if <h2> tags could work instead of <a> that would be lovely :) coz the browser wouldn't jump to top
[00:29:06] <Cork> jozefk: http://jsfiddle.net/FqqhY/260/
[00:29:53] <Cork> jnewt: that doesn't really answer my question
[00:30:08] <Cork> jnewt: you need to collect the data and build an object to give you ajax
[00:30:30] <Cork> data: { value: [1,2,3,4,5], other: { key: 'value' } } will work
[00:30:51] <Cork> jnewt: so what you need to decide is how you want to identify the data
[00:31:00] <Cork> and where you are going to get it from
[00:31:11] <jozefk> Cork, thanks! but if I click on the second <h2> the first one is still open. is it possible to have it close?
[00:31:20] <Cork> sure
[00:31:53] <Cork> jozefk: http://jsfiddle.net/FqqhY/261/
[00:32:59] <jozefk> great! :) do I need jquery 2 for this to work or 1.10.2 is fine?
[00:33:30] <Cork> jozefk: works with anything >= 1.9
[00:33:40] <Cork> jozefk: but with some changes it can work with 1.5 too
[00:34:28] <jozefk> and the text which I want to show/hide must be inside the div or ul? what if I just use <p> below the <h2> would it work?
[00:37:49] <Cork> jozefk: read and try to understand the code
[00:38:02] <Cork> if you do it should answer your question :)
[00:38:41] <Cork> jozefk: you should always make sure you understand the code you add to your page, else you WILL get problem down the road when you need to modify it
[00:38:52] <EGreg> hey guys
[00:39:00] <EGreg> how can I get a source code viewer like this one: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery
[00:39:19] <jozefk> yes I just tried and it works! :) I read the code as well but for me this looks like a magic. how does jquery knows what to hide exactly? :)
[00:39:30] <EGreg> http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/under-jquerys-bonnet/
[00:40:05] <Cork> jozefk: based on the class on the element you can click on
[00:40:21] <Cork> jozefk: it starts by grabbing all elements with the class toggle
[00:40:38] <Cork> and then grabs the directly following elements and run .hide() on it
[00:40:47] <Cork> jozefk: same happens in the click listener
[00:40:56] <Cork> but it excludes the element you clicked on
[00:40:56] <jozefk> oh that's the .next() part
[00:41:04] <Cork> and runs .toggle explicitly on it
[00:41:09] <Cork> ?api next
[00:41:09] <b-ot> Cork: .next(): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[00:42:37] <jozefk> so that means if I have more then one paragraph only the first one would be hidden yeah?
[00:42:48] <jozefk> than*
[00:42:50] <Cork> yes
[00:42:59] <Cork> just wrap them in a div and it should work
[00:43:08] <Cork> (all of them)
[00:43:38] <jozefk> ok. thanks so much boss! :) I need to read a lot more to learn all these things
[00:43:42] <Clooney> hello
[01:01:41] <jozefk> Cork, what about some easing effect? should I go with jquery ui instead?
[01:02:02] <mehrdad> hello. i'm trying to create a simple html editor and i'm using draggable lib to move elements around. my problem is that the clicked element is moved rather than copied so the copy is dragged. i have a few ideas how to go about this, but i don't know my tools in jquery
[01:02:03] <Cork> jozefk: easing is supported in jquery natively
[01:02:19] <Cork> jozefk: you can use slide, fade and easing on those
[01:02:25] <Cork> ?api fadeIn
[01:02:26] <b-ot> Cork: .fadeIn(): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[01:02:30] <Cork> ?api slideDown
[01:02:31] <b-ot> Cork: .slideDown(): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[01:02:40] <mehrdad> like, when the element is clicked, a new instance must be created at the same location as the main element and this second element must be draggble
[01:03:00] <jozefk> instead of .hide and .toggle yeah?
[01:03:10] <mehrdad> that's one way to do it
[01:03:18] <mehrdad> but i don't know what api i must use
[01:03:27] <Cork> ?api showToggle
[01:03:27] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[01:03:32] <Cork> hmm
[01:03:40] <Cork> gah...
[01:03:45] <Cork> ?api slideToggle
[01:03:46] <b-ot> Cork: .slideToggle(): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[01:03:50] <Cork> ?api fadeToggle
[01:03:51] <b-ot> Cork: .fadeToggle(): Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[01:04:06] <Cork> jozefk: and Out and Up for hide
[01:04:14] <mehrdad> can some one please give a hint
[01:04:31] <Cork> jozefk: tip look on the api.jquery.com page it documents all these functions
[01:05:09] <mehrdad> creating a new exact element at original element's location shouldn't be much problem, but how do i make it draggable?
[01:05:27] <jozefk> OK thanks. I will read
[01:06:30] <mehrdad> thinking more about it, i have a more clear idea how to do it now
[01:06:40] <mehrdad> but still i am not fluent in js so ...
[01:07:25] <mehrdad> when the element is clicked, create a new instance of the element at the original location, with a higher z-index... then attach draggable to the new element
[01:07:45] <mehrdad> Cork: can you shed a glimpse of light ?
[01:08:25] <Cork> mehrdad: are you using draggable or?
[01:08:37] <Cork> or how are you handling the elements?
[01:09:07] <mehrdad> Cork:  yeah, draggable lib
[01:09:21] <mehrdad> now, the idea is right , right?
[01:10:28] <Cork> mehrdad: yes
[01:10:34] <Cork> you cant to clone the original element
[01:10:40] <Cork> it is a setting for draggable
[01:11:26] <mehrdad> pardon ?
[01:12:11] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-helper
[01:14:01] <mehrdad> that's great thanks!
[01:14:08] <mehrdad> i overlooked that option
[01:14:25] <mehrdad> now , the element doesn't drop...let's see how to solve this one
[01:14:40] <mehrdad> the clone, that is
[01:14:47] <Cork> mehrdad: you need to stop event
[01:14:59] <mehrdad> hmm, let me see...
[01:15:01] <Cork> as the helper will be removed on drop
[01:15:09] <mehrdad> ok
[01:20:05] <jozefk> .slideToggle() and .slideToggle("swing") are the same. I don't see any difference
[01:21:13] <grafi> `api slideToggle
[01:21:13] <b-ot> grafi: .slideToggle(): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[01:21:19] <grafi> ?api slideToggle
[01:21:19] <b-ot> grafi: .slideToggle(): Display or hide the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/

[01:24:18] <lemonsparrow> I have a single <h1> tag in my page.. is there a waY I could get it using JQuery without any class name and id ?
[01:24:30] <Cork> lemonsparrow: $('h1')
[01:25:32] <grafi> wizardry
[01:25:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: cool thanks :)
[01:28:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: is there a way to improve this piece of code.. shorten this http://pastebin.com/QzbjTfty ??
[01:29:29] <Cork> you could use an array and check if the value is in there and grab the strings from it
[01:29:36] <Cork> then you could remove all the if cases
[01:30:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can I have that text and attr in a single line while assigning ?
[01:31:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: could you correct my code and show me.. would understand better
[01:31:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: current code looks very naive
[01:31:18] <Cork> not as they are different elements
[01:31:19] <seutje> or you could cast it to a number, divide it by 25 and convert it to first, second, third, ...
[01:33:00] <lemonsparrow> seutje: good one.. but I dont't think need to go that far to reduce few lines :)
[01:33:11] <mehrdad> Cork: i can use the stop event now, but the problem is that i can't get the element underneath the cursor to dop the element into
[01:33:28] <mehrdad> document.elementFromPoint returns the currently dragging element
[01:34:55] <mehrdad> drop*
[01:35:03] <Cork> mehrdad: i don't remember fully haven't used the plugin for ages
[01:35:16] <Cork> but you could remove the helper before you check i guess
[01:35:17] <seutje> lemonsparrow: oh... http://pastebin.com/PWKQfuqR
[01:36:41] <lemonsparrow> seutje: var title = titles[Math.ceil(parseInt(numberOfDays, 10) / 25) -1]; this is epic but in my case I would always only have two values either 25 or 50 and two titles.. First Title and Second Title :)
[01:37:20] <seutje> guess it's a bit silly then
[01:37:29] <seutje> but u can still combine the 2 that use the same method
[01:37:38] <seutje> $('#reportType, h1').text(title);
[01:37:56] <lemonsparrow> seutje: yes
[01:40:58] <Lewix> I have a dropdown menu or rather I want to create a dropdown menu - http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/ - whenever someone click on the class 'toggle' i want it to expand and appear as it is to then make subsequent selection. The dropdown menu is in a container and I want it to ignore the container whenever it expands - as if it were stacked over the container
[01:59:31] <mehrdad> hey Cork , thanks for the help so far
[02:00:16] <mehrdad> ihave managed to get the underlying element , now a new problem is there to solve
[02:01:19] <mehrdad> in the stop event i have this var elem = document.elementFromPoint(ui.offset.left, ui.offset.top);
[02:15:32] <silverdiamond> morning all, got a quick query (hopefully). Using colorbox plugin for a gallery but I need to unbind the colorbox call on the gallery of thumbnails click initially. Whats the best way of removing then later adding it back in? (please)
[02:18:19] <bgy> Hi
[02:24:01] <javalover> figure i'll just ask in here
[02:24:20] <javalover> I have a searcher, which is searching my xml....it creates a list much like google does of what the user could be searching for
[02:24:48] <javalover> the problem i'm having is different things can be returned by this search, and I want to format it so the right thing is returned
[02:25:01] <javalover> i guess i'm just confused is all
[02:25:34] <grafi> javalover still confused
[02:25:35] <grafi> :p
[02:25:41] <bahamas> hello. if I want to populate a field with jquery, I should use attr({value: 'my value'}), right?
[02:25:47] <javalover> yeah
[02:25:53] <bahamas> an input field I mean
[02:26:15] <javalover> wait bahamas I wasn't answering you lol
[02:26:19] <javalover> I was just saying i'm confused
[02:26:40] <grafi> and you confused bahamas
[02:26:42] <grafi> xD
[02:26:48] <gregf_> bahamas: $('#input_elem_id').val(<yourval>)
[02:27:00] <bahamas> javalover: I realized
[02:27:43] <grafi> javalover i think you need to be more specific
[02:27:53] <gregf_> haha, thats was the first thing i learnt when i looked at jQuery :/
[02:27:57] <javalover> actually I just realized what's goin on
[02:28:01] <gregf_> s/thats/that/
[02:28:06] <grafi> thats cool
[02:28:06] <grafi> :P
[02:28:13] <javalover> basically, the searcher is only searching for 1 thing right now
[02:28:24] <javalover> so my results are based on 1 value from the database
[02:28:34] <javalover> and what I have to do is also search other values...
[02:28:58] <javalover> I think what's best is to create an array/hashtable that allows me to search & then determine what it found
[02:29:04] <javalover> and based on what it found display proper results
[02:30:00] <grafi> sounds interesting
[02:30:01] <grafi> ^^
[02:30:09] <javalover> it's weird cuz i'm searching xml
[02:30:16] <javalover> i've never really done this before i'm using someone elses function
[02:30:31] <grafi> xml is weird
[02:30:31] <grafi> :P
[02:37:37] <bahamas> gregf_: that is setting the 'value' property which means it doesn't update a rendered node.
[02:37:45] <bahamas> at least, I'm not seeing it show up
[02:37:58] <grafi> it should
[02:39:16] <doev> does someone know a jquery-easyui support chat?
[02:39:47] <doev> maybe someone knows ... I like to get a table/datagrid to 100% fit a div
[02:43:51] <bahamas> grafi: you are right. if I do it in the console, it works, so the problem is elsewhere
[02:54:02] <Lewix>  any idea how to hide an element BUT show an element nested in that element?
[02:54:12] <nisseni> I'm making a webshop with alternate images on the left hand side of the main image, however, sometimes the product has a lot of alt images which makes the element to high, so I want to group images four and four and scroll down to reach each "group" - is this understandable?
[02:54:19] <Cork> Lewix: you can't
[02:54:35] <Lewix> Cork: right. a way around it?
[02:54:40] <Cork> Lewix: you have to separate them so they arn't inside it
[02:54:54] <Cork> Lewix: add a wrapper around the parent and move the children out of the parent
[02:55:28] <Lewix> Cork: i cant really do that
[02:55:39] <Cork> then you can't do it
[02:56:15] <Lewix> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/ im trying to show my class 'toggle' but hide the rest
[02:56:58] <ravenzz> $('.sort-wrap').children(':not(.toggle)').hide()
[02:57:45] <Cork> Lewix: http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/1/
[02:58:14] <ravenzz> or with css yea
[02:59:05] <ravenzz> maybe .sort-wrap.show > *
[02:59:18] <Cork> good point
[03:00:35] <Lewix> hmm ravenzz Cork thanks guys let me go through it
[03:05:09] <Lewix> Cork: ravenzz
[03:05:21] <Lewix> nope, there's that extra black space that i dont want
[03:05:36] <Cork> Lewix: most likely padding or margin on the parent
[03:06:05] <Cork> or you have spaces in the source and it is inline or inline-block
[03:06:09] <Lewix> Cork: I tried to get rid of it
[03:09:13] <Cork> Lewix: what extra space are you talking about?
[03:10:28] <Cork> Lewix: http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/2/ ?
[03:10:29] <Lewix> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/8xqt4/1/ the dark background of the parent element -
[03:11:34] <Lewix> Cork: thanks!!! ill go over it - but out of curiosity where was that coming from - padding margin couldnt get rid of it
[03:14:31] <Anticom> hey guys
[03:14:42] <Anticom> could it be, that this plugin http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/ is not compatible with the current jq version?
[03:15:05] <Anticom> any experiences?
[03:16:28] <Cork> Anticom: try loading the migration plugin
[03:16:43] <iaj> Cork: I tried your approach, but it won't disable the submit buttons on my page... is there something wrong about that code?   http://pastebin.com/7SjPgT5a
[03:17:08] <iaj> Basically I got the habit of using jQuery() because I had some conflict issues back then, with prototype.
[03:17:14] <Cork> iaj: make a demo of the code on jsfiddle
[03:17:19] <Anticom> Cork maybe i'll have a look into the plugin to see where it fails. strangely debugger says that $ or jQuery is not a fn... maybe i just messed with my jq include ;)
[03:17:20] <Cork> including an example of your form
[03:17:24] <Anticom> just wanted to ask
[03:17:40] <Cork> Anticom: sounds like you arn't including jquery ya
[03:17:42] <joroci> anyone using cdn?
[03:17:52] <iaj> Cork: hmmm ok.. so I just copy over the html stuff from my page.
[03:18:05] <Cork> iaj: the relevant parts yes
[03:18:07] <Anticom> Cork but i actually am (using code.jq.com cdn for the sake of this prototype)
[03:18:24] <Cork> Anticom: fiddle it
[03:18:46] <joroci> hey Cork
[03:21:19] <iaj> Cork: does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/2uMfk/
[03:21:51] <Cork> ah image
[03:22:00] <iaj> that's not catched?
[03:22:01] <Cork> iaj: check the selector in the function
[03:22:21] <iaj> input[type="image"] add to that?
[03:22:25] <Cork> ya
[03:22:50] <Cork> also no linebreaks in strings
[03:25:18] <iaj> thanks alot... will try in a second :)
[03:25:35] <iaj> You handle it that way usually or do you also pop up an alert that it's already being submitted?
[03:26:04] <Cork> i usually don't disable things
[03:26:18] <Cork> at least not generically like this
[03:26:36] <Cork> but if you want to make it more obvious add a throbber to the form
[03:28:04] <Lewix> Cork: how would you make it play nicely with js, use the sot-wrap.show when its click, and remove it when its clicked again
[03:28:35] <Cork> Lewix: $('.sot-wrap').toggleClass('show')
[03:28:57] <Cork> Lewix: you might want to pick a more descriptive class name though
[03:30:28] <squeakytoy> possible to ask jquerymobile questions here as well?
[03:30:50] <iaj> Cork: thanks:) Hmm do you have an example of that "throbber to the form" you were referring to?
[03:32:54] <squeakytoy> I am adding content dynimically on my jquerymobile page, however, i am noticing that certain widgets/transformed aren't being updated. Anyone know how I can trigger jquerymobile to update  all widgets?

[04:05:09] <Lewix> Cork: I cant get it to work with js and the new css. everything dissapear
[04:05:27] <Lewix> Cork: everything dissapear when the button is clicked on
[04:05:54] <Cork> Lewix: then you haven't copied all of the css i added
[04:06:01] <Lewix> Cork: my class toggle contains an image instead of that white space
[04:06:09] <Lewix> Cork: copy pasted
[04:07:15] <Lewix> Cork: it prolly have something to do with the image..im investigating
[04:19:59] <ignus> hey there! I got some issues getting .resizable to work with a backbone.merionette itemview. When I initialize the view, I add this.$el.draggable(); and this.$el.resizable(); Although draggable seems to work fine, resizable doesn't :/ and I really don't know what could be wrong. Related stackoverflow post (for context) here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20192733/jquery-ui-resizable-not-working-on-marionette-itemviem
[04:21:42] <seutje> ignus: doesn't overriding the CSS asplode the resizable?
[04:22:14] <seutje> also, shouldn't you be doing those onrender instead of oninit
[04:24:06] <ignus> thanx seutje! I put the jquery-ui methods onRender and they work! :)
[04:25:27] <seutje> ignus: cheers, but do note that this is called everything the item is "refreshed", so you might wanna add a check to see if it's already resizable, or if jQuery UI thinks it's still resizable, when it isn't
[04:27:08] <ignus> seutje: so everytime i resize the item, and it get re-rendered, I'm attaching to it the .resizable and .draggable methods?
[04:28:41] <seutje> ignus: when the collection gets changed and it re-renders it, but the current item was also in the previous set, I believe it gets re-rendered, removing the added DOM elements, but not removing the data pointer resizable uses to check if it was already applied
[04:28:57] <seutje> just try it and see if it fails, might just be me being paranoid
[04:29:27] <ignus> will do! thanx for all the pointer and help
[04:32:11] <ignus> seutje: I've added the .draggable/resizable methods inside the ItemView onRender method, therefore I don't think I'm gonna have issues with the CollectionView (since applying draggable/resizable is the ItemView's responsibility) Do you think I might still have issues?
[04:32:51] <seutje> ignus: oh ok, as long as it isn't a CompositeView or CollectionView, you should be fine
[04:33:13] <ignus> :)
[04:34:53] <Serdar> Hi I got a strange question
[04:35:07] <Serdar> is it possible to get a tabbed modal dialog window?
[04:47:47] <Cork> Serdar: sure, though you will have to tinker a bit
[04:47:59] <Cork> Serdar: you can combine the dialog plugin with the tab plugin
[04:50:24] <Serdar> Cork, hmm maybe this could solve my problem with more than one modal dialog
[04:51:02] <Cork> Serdar: warning though the jquery ui theme at least was quite buggy when you added tabs inside a dialog
[04:51:09] <Cork> they might have fixed that since
[04:52:42] <Serdar> I need to try
[04:58:04] <kpl> I tested https://github.com/dciccale/custom-radio-checkbox, and to be able to use my own checkbox image. In firebug I see: <label for="customcheck"><input id="customcheck" class="rc-hidden" type="checkbox"><i class="checkbox"></i></label>. The <i>-part is inserted by the "Plugin". It looks good on screen, but on print preview, the image is not there. What should I do have the image also on...
[04:58:05] <kpl> ...printouts?
[04:59:08] <Cork> kpl: you can use styled checkboxes without the need for js
[04:59:40] <kpl> Do you have more info/link?
[05:02:34] <Cork> kpl: thrown together on the spot but http://jsfiddle.net/DYqsd/
[05:03:50] <kpl> Nice! Do you know how this works with things like IE6 etc?
[05:04:37] <Cork> you would have to change quite a few things in ie 6
[05:04:39] <Cork> it is doable
[05:04:46] <Cork> but i know that exact example doesn't work
[05:05:01] <Cork> i think + selectors doesn't work in ie6
[05:05:28] <Cork> kpl: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors#Browser_compatibility
[05:05:34] <Cork> so ya, ie7 in a min
[05:06:53] <TripTastic> Cork, your fiddle just reminded me of something I have to finish off on a form :P
[05:06:54] <kpl> I guess it's time to stop supporting IE6..
[05:07:27] <Cork> kpl: check so ie7 and 8 works ok first though
[05:07:32] <TripTastic> though I have to make custom circular radio buttons
[05:07:38] <Cork> (see the notes from mdn)
[05:07:52] <Cork> TripTastic: not much difference in complexity
[05:08:06] <TripTastic> nope I did it for the first time on my last project
[05:08:24] <Cork> i love how you can do these things without the need for even images :)
[05:08:28] <TripTastic> I need to think of ways to spice them up a little bit though
[05:08:41] <TripTastic> the last one was flat which is fine
[05:08:51] <TripTastic> but I like a little detail in radio buttons
[05:09:16] <TripTastic> I am slowly grasping UI stuff
[05:09:20] <Cork> TripTastic: so add a span inside the label and go lose with border-radious + gradien + inset :)
[05:09:32] <TripTastic> so I hope to soon be making those sliding toggle type radio buttons soon
[05:09:54] <TripTastic> I love those sliding button types

[05:10:23] <TripTastic> ^ current project
[05:10:26] <Rohan_Bhangui_> grafi: morning
[05:10:35] <TripTastic> the designer forgot to define where he wanted the newsletter button
[05:10:44] <TripTastic> any ideas on ways to make that side button better?
[05:10:56] <TripTastic> trying to think of an icon that screams newsletter
[05:11:02] <TripTastic> had thought of the envelope icon
[05:11:11] <TripTastic> but not sure if people would confuse it with email
[05:11:29] <TripTastic> the newsletter button takes up too much room on mobile
[05:12:01] <TripTastic> nice thing though is this is the first time I got image sprites to work in CSS :D
[05:13:15] <Cork> TripTastic: http://jsfiddle.net/DYqsd/1/
[05:14:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> TripTastic: if you want icons best place for inspiration is dribbble.com
[05:14:37] <TripTastic> I need to start posting stuff on dribble so I can get drafted
[05:16:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: i use -webkit-appearance: none; to hide default elements <---is that bad practice
[05:16:58] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: you can't get it to not draw something in it
[05:17:16] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: so if you want custom design of the box you can't use the input
[05:17:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[05:17:42] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: but no it isn't bad practice at all
[05:17:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause i still want to use the radio button
[05:17:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i just want to style it
[05:17:51] <Cork> (i prefer it my self actually)
[05:18:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what should i use
[05:18:01] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: ya, that just it, you can't
[05:18:14] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: if you want to style it you need to use the hack i showed you
[05:18:32] <Cork> if you want the default style or default unskinned style you can use the inputs look
[05:18:50] <Cork> (with or without -<prefix>-apperance: none
[05:18:51] <Cork> )
[05:18:59] <Cork> but be sure to use all the prefixes
[05:19:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay ill book mark your hack\
[05:19:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i am building aui kit
[05:19:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> and require custom radio buttons
[05:19:34] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: basically if you want custom looking input elements you need a hack like that or use js
[05:19:38] <slax0r> Cork: remember from before, the parent situation? well, can I call a custom function from the child tab in the parent tab?
[05:19:50] <slax0r> like, window.parent.myCustomFunction(); ?
[05:20:00] <Cork> slax0r: tecnically yes, but there is limitations
[05:20:28] <Cork> if the function references to window or document it can be really messy
[05:21:16] <slax0r> well, this function would only add a class with jquery to an existing element in the parent tab
[05:21:35] <Cork> that is accessing document :)
[05:21:39] <slax0r> but I'm getting an error in such way, object global has no method myCustomFunction
[05:21:48] <slax0r> in the child
[05:23:20] <slax0r> I'm thinking it will be easier to just set the data in php session and reload the page :/
[05:26:00] <slax0r> btw Cork, parent doesn't work, like window.parent.location.reload(), keeps reloading it self in ifinite loop, while window.opener.location.reload() works like a blast
[05:26:16] <Cork> ah right
[05:26:21] <Cork> parent is for frames
[05:26:22] <Cork> sorry
[05:26:28] <slax0r> no problem :)
[05:26:40] <Cork> was so long since i used these old technologies :)
[05:27:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: i hope old tech gets abolished fast
[05:27:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> people need to stop using ie <8
[05:27:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> * <ie9
[05:27:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> so that we can all start using jquery 2.0.3
[05:28:35] <slax0r> Cork: yeah, me too, but I think I need them in this particular situation :/
[05:29:18] <slax0r> I'm using google login, and need the page to stay at same state as is when clicked on button, but gplus login redirects to their own page, so I'm opening a new tab, handling the login there, and then simply calling a function in the parent
[05:29:26] <slax0r> well, actually it's a connect, not login
[05:32:17] <daveaway> 'lo, with jquery ui, how do i make resizable work on newly created div
[05:32:40] <Cork> daveaway: you need to run the plugin on each div as you add them
[05:33:07] <daveaway> how so?
[05:33:29] <daveaway> like put the jquery into the <div somefunction()>
[05:35:02] <Cork> var var newDiv = $('<div>'); parent.append(newDiv); newDiv.resizable();
[05:35:23] <daveaway> aye, that's how im doing it;/

[05:57:43] <Jacta> Can anyone help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/z3Pc6/1/ - Trying to get it to work :/
[05:58:01] <Jacta> Made a version that works with one change, but with two/(or more) im lost :(
[05:59:52] <Cork> Jacta: what is the question
[06:00:32] <Jacta> Cork: how to get futher? The version Ive made that allow one change in the number works, but I need to be able to correct more sections
[06:01:14] <Cork> Jacta: "further"...
[06:01:22] <Cork> well val is for form fields
[06:01:32] <Cork> you want to use text on line 7
[06:01:42] <Cork> not sure what else "further" means
[06:02:04] <Jacta> Good point, yes, didnt catch that one - but im lost if i need regex to do it? also describes problem in there
[06:02:18] <Cork> not sure what it is you want to do
[06:02:25] <Jacta> see old script in line 22
[06:03:12] <Jacta> and examples in 16-18 - i want to change number in #test with the one given.. x = space in #test
[06:03:30] <Cork> just straight out replace them?
[06:03:38] <Cork> or what should the match be based on?
[06:04:14] <doev> I have problem with a ajax request. http://localhost/ajax is working well, if I call direct in the browser, but when used in an ajax-request I get an internal server err 500.
[06:04:25] <Jacta> if my number is "10 20 30 40" and I do changeProductNO("xxx50") then the number should be "10 20 30 50"
[06:04:38] <Cork> uh
[06:04:59] <Jacta> but also changeproductno("2030x50" should work -> "20 30 30 50"
[06:05:01] <doev> x.support.cors.e.crossDomain.send jquery.min.js:6 ... x.extend.ajax jquery.min.js:6
[06:05:01] <doev> $.fn.datagrid.defaults.$.extend.loader ... jquery.easyui.min.js:9052 ... _5e0 jquery.easyui.min.js:8358 ... (anonymous function)
[06:05:05] <doev> can someone help?
[06:05:07] <Cork> O_o
[06:06:12] <Cork> doev: so something breaks server side, check the logs
[06:06:15] <Jacta> Cork: makes sense now?
[06:06:22] <Cork> Jacta: not really
[06:06:40] <Cork> i guess you want to build two arrays play around with them to get the order you want
[06:06:48] <Cork> and then join the new/modified array
[06:07:08] <Jacta> basicly yes, x should match the original groups
[06:08:04] <daveaway> http://pastebin.com/iK8yBWZv  Cork
[06:08:37] <daveaway> doesnt work, i've tried it as a function outside of document ready and also tried addClass and use resizable on that class
[06:08:45] <daveaway> the draggable() works, but not the resizable
[06:09:06] <daveaway> i've tried adding handles also, but... they appeared to work but not inside that box
[06:09:13] <Cork> daveaway: that will break as you trigger the plugin on every element every time
[06:10:42] <airdem> Cork, it just .... worked! thanks mate
[06:10:48] <doev> Cork, no nothing in the error logs, its like, the ajax-script is never called.,
[06:11:05] <Cork> doev: you said you got 500 error server side
[06:11:42] <daveaway> how you mean cork? it only get's triggered once
[06:12:00] <daveaway> (using the variable ataggetready)
[06:12:13] <Cork> daveaway: $('.atag') will match every element with that class
[06:12:18] <Cork> not just the newly added one
[06:12:19] <daveaway> there is only one element
[06:12:30] <Jacta> Cork: got a clue?
[06:12:37] <daveaway> aye, see , i was going to addClass it when i got it working
[06:12:47] <daveaway> addclass('inediting');
[06:12:55] <Cork> daveaway: just store the element in a variable before you append it
[06:13:00] <Cork> and run the command on that
[06:13:03] <Cork> and you won't have the problem
[06:13:08] <doev> Cork, yes .... strange. I made a test. If I put in the json-output to a static file test.json and use it as url, everything works.
[06:13:09] <daveaway> okay
[06:13:28] <Cork> doev: ya, the server you use errored out
[06:13:36] <Cork> doev: you said so in the initial question
[06:13:58] <Cork> "get an internal server err 500."
[06:14:10] <Cork> that means it isn't client side
[06:16:09] <doev> Cork, chromium's jconsole say: 500 Error, but firefox's: [15:14:57.634] SyntaxError: Using //@ to indicate source map URL pragmas is deprecated.
[06:16:27] <Cork> doev: the last one is just a warning
[06:16:36] <Cork> like it says "depricated"
[06:16:53] <doev> Cork, but last one has "syntaxError" in front
[06:17:05] <Cork> ya, but it is from the map link in jquery
[06:17:19] <Cork> it's nothing related
[06:17:36] <Cork> //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery.min.map <--
[06:17:56] <Cork> line 2 in your jquery.js file
[06:18:00] <ajm203> the .map files are just helpers for a browser's script debugger, you can ignore those
[06:18:09] <Cork> no
[06:18:20] <Cork> the error is cause the //@ has been replaced in newer browsers
[06:18:39] <Cork> but jquery still uses it cause not all browsers support the new syntax
[06:18:53] <ajm203> right, still ignore it :)

[06:50:12] <fonewiz> Do you have anything in the href=""?
[06:50:34] <fonewiz> If not try adding #
[06:50:35] <mrchris> fonewiz: no
[06:50:48] <mrchris> fonewiz: when I do that it scrolls to the top of the page when clicked on
[06:51:21] <mrchris> fonewiz: I need to find out from the #angularjs  guys what the solution is
[06:51:30] <fonewiz> But does the cursor turn into a hand?
[06:51:44] <mrchris> fonewiz: yes when I add a href
[06:52:09] <fonewiz> In your JS code I think you can add

[06:52:53] <fonewiz> Just don't have the syntax handy

[07:30:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> anli__: well in that case you dont specify checked in your html
[07:30:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> for radio buttons
[07:31:25] <BillCriswell> Damn, Chrome's text rendering sucks on Windows XP
[07:32:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: you can fix with : -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; and using font-weight
[07:33:27] <BillCriswell> Ah, does look a little better... I think it's just being so used to a Mac my whole life.
[07:33:45] <BillCriswell> Defintely did help. Thanks.
[07:34:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> BillCriswell: no problem, windows antialiasing sucks, except for certain fonts like times new roman and roboto
[07:34:37] <airdem> i am iteration over a set of elements and want to add some html to a variable on each iteration
[07:34:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> arial too
[07:34:52] <airdem> do i create an empty variable or object and append into it?
[07:35:38] <BillCriswell> airdem: var obj = {}; obj.foo = 'bar';
[07:35:55] <airdem> usually i would do var foo = $(<div></div>); and append into that in each step
[07:35:56] <BillCriswell> airdem: What will you be appending to it?
[07:35:57] <nmkr> Rohan_Bhangui: thanks.. i solve it via an ajax php backend check..
[07:36:08] <airdem> BillCriswell, would like to use jquery function like append , etc
[07:36:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya thats the toher way to do it
[07:36:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> .push ?
[07:37:00] <BillCriswell> airdem: If you're doing a lot of appending just doing $('<div></div').append(oneLongString) over a bunch of small strings would be quicker.( in my experience, at least ).
[07:39:17] <Bauer> guys, I have this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/xhsUG/ it works and generates a div with "Details" for some reason, and I cant see any way to actually open the Dialog box.. how am I supposed to use the Dialog popup to open a popup with additional details?
[07:40:08] <Bauer> I also tried modifying to this: http://jsfiddle.net/xhsUG/1/ on line 12
[07:42:23] <Bauer> and I found another weird thing: .dialog actually steals the original element! when the user closes the dialog, the original element is destroyer :)
[07:42:25] <Bauer> destroyed
[08:20:01] <BillCriswell> Any of you guys "design in the browser"?
[08:21:26] <BillCriswell> Instead of photoshop / illustrator / etc.
[08:28:02] <Bauer> How do I make this line: $('#'+DescID).bind("click", CreateDialogPopup(DescID, DomData) ); execute function when clicked? currently it executes on document load
[08:28:54] <NoiseEee> Bauer: anonymous functions / references; you're executing it right away
[08:29:15] <Bauer> NoiseEee: yeah, but how to do this properly?
[08:29:27] <NoiseEee> Bauer: $('#'+DescID).on('click',function() { createDialogPopup(DescID,DomData});
[08:29:50] <NoiseEee> Bauer: but i'm obligated to ask you where DescID and DomData are coming from, presumably they've been set in lines of code ahead?
[08:30:03] <Bauer> yes NoiseEee
[08:30:50] <Bauer> but I dont understand this weird way of Javascript.. I need to create a function to call the intended function?
[08:31:08] <NoiseEee> anything() is going to execute "anything" immeidately
[08:31:26] <shoky> you need an event handler (a function designed to handle an event)
[08:31:46] <shoky> nothing weird about that
[08:31:57] * Bauer shakes head :( only javascript does those things...
[08:32:05] <shoky> so not true
[08:32:29] <Bauer> I've never seen stuff like this in PHP, Java, Perl, Python etc...
[08:32:53] <shoky> in java you have to create a whole new class for it.. what are you talking  about
[08:33:44] <shoky> what's wrong with needing an event handler :\
[08:34:21] <Bauer> it looks counter intuitive; everytime I look into that line above, I cant help but feel its some kind of abomination
[08:34:52] <Bauer> a function just to call a function.. it looks bad
[08:35:18] <shoky> how would you do this in java? php? perl? python?
[08:36:26] <shoky> and btw in javascript you can also do  .on('click', createDialogPopup.bind(null, DescID, DomData))
[08:36:27] <Bauer> in those normal languages, I've never needed to do such nasty function call, but then none of them (except java) doesnt use even listeners
[08:36:36] <shoky> you haven't answered my question, but ok
[08:37:09] <shoky> none of them uses event listeners?
[08:37:16] <Bauer> because I dont think event listeners exist in those except Java (with which I didnt work a lot)
[08:37:18] <shoky> so you HAVEN'T done this in those languages?
[08:37:35] <shoky> so you have no point?
[08:37:47] <Bauer> I did event listeners in Android, and I dont recall such a nasty syntax
[08:37:57] <Bauer> to subscribe on events
[08:38:05] <shoky> show some..
[08:38:17] <shoky> how would you do the same thing in android
[08:40:09] <Bauer> hmm you are right shoky, apparently its same principle: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/ui-events.html except that in Java, all examples make this look friendly, and clear. While all Javascript (jquery, to be percise) dont show this properly
[08:40:53] <shoky> the jquery docs show it all too properly, donno what you're talking about. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[08:41:06] <shoky> $( "#target" ).click(function() {  alert( "Handler for .click() called." );  });
[08:41:14] <shoky> what's not clear
[08:41:16] <shoky> or friendly
[08:42:24] <shoky> or 1st example for .on:  $( "p" ).on( "click", function() {  alert( $( this ).text() );  });
[08:42:25] <Bauer> shoky: they all show simple, basic anonymous examples
[08:42:34] <shoky> which is exactly what you needed
[08:42:47] <shoky> a simple basic anonymous event handler, in which you do whatever you want to do
[08:42:47] <Bauer> they NEVER show something more common, with parameters
[08:42:54] <shoky> alert( "Handler for .click() called." );
[08:42:58] <shoky> there is a parameter there..
[08:43:06] <joroci> no,  i need them to type the code for me
[08:43:32] <Bauer> yes, which also promots the messy unreadable code, where the bulk of the logic code is defined inside events, isntead in proper, structured functions at the very least (not to mention classes)
[08:43:42] <shoky> o gawd
[08:43:49] <shoky> so you move to a different invalid point?
[08:44:28] <shoky> also the android link you gave is a guide, not an API reference
[08:44:44] <Bauer> shoky, that is not a parameter lol.. its part of the (anonymous) function's body
[08:44:49] <shoky> wtf?
[08:44:54] <shoky> that's a parameter just like in your example
[08:45:00] <shoky> alert( "Handler for .click() called." );
[08:45:08] <shoky> CreateDialogPopup(DescID, DomData)
[08:45:22] <shoky> you have 2 params. they have 1
[08:46:17] <Bauer> ahhh, yes if you call that a parameter.. sorry, my thinking is always trying to call a function, not declare an anon function which calls the intended function..
[08:46:45] <shoky> ;]
[08:47:05] <shoky> rant away dude
[08:50:36] <Bauer> heheh, thanks :) and to NoiseEee too :) but now I have another problem.. the .dialog is not working in my page, there are no related errors in console. even manually, doing .dialog is not doing any action I can see
[08:52:24] <Bauer> and this happens only to the certain divs I need, other divs I test on work (except that closing the jquery dialog removes the element, kind of ctrl-x)
[08:52:27] <shoky> `demo
[08:52:28] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:55:55] <Bauer> shoky: hard to cut off the code, here: https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm click VM, click Win 2008 and finally click on the middle "Details" items (text) - you will see the content spilled into a div, but even manually targetting the element: $('#VMWindows2008R2Platinum-PopUp').dialog("option", "closeOnEscape"); is not working
[08:56:18] <shoky> getting a 403
[08:57:07] <shoky> how's ccc's cloud btw?
[08:57:34] <shoky> (they're my isp :P )
[09:02:22] <Bauer> wow shoky, you know what are the chances for this? :P like, astronomical :)
[09:03:19] <Bauer> shoky: can you try again pls?
[09:03:31] <shoky> ;] you're now the 3rd person i know on ccc :P
[09:03:32] <jop008> Can I filter all items with this wildcard persondelete_?
[09:03:47] <shoky> Bauer: still 403
[09:03:48] <jop008> after the _ there is a recordID
[09:04:54] <shoky> items?
[09:04:56] <shoky> in what
[09:06:13] <shoky> ok works now Bauer
[09:07:24] <shoky> oh you work for ccc? nice
[09:07:29] <Bauer> shoky :) whom else do you know here? and about ccc's cloud - they keep me busy with that portal for the camapaign.. they have like a lot of changes every day to do :P
[09:08:13] <shoky> Bauer: heh just a friend of mine whom i recommended ccc to a while back
[09:09:25] <Bauer> pm, shoky? if you tell me who, I could say hi tomorrow :P
[09:09:48] <shoky> ohh not someone who works there :P i meant a client, like me :D
[09:10:07] <shoky> i hadn't realized yet that you worked there ;p
[09:10:16] <paulvd> hello, to target window with below 769 I am using if (jQuery(window).width() < 769) {, but what if I want to target windows below 769 but not target windows below 650?
[09:10:26] <paulvd> window width*
[09:13:02] <shoky> Bauer: you have to initialize the .dialog widget first by calling .dialog() or .dialog({..options..})  so i think you want:  .dialog({closeOnEscape: true})
[09:13:04] <Bauer> ahh, yeah shoky.. its nice place - usually relaxed, just now a little busy with this stuff (of which I am getting tired)
[09:14:04] <shoky> how long have you been working there?
[09:14:34] <Bauer> shoky: not according to the documentation: http://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default and I tried calling just $.dialog() in console - its not recognized
[09:14:49] <shoky> Bauer:  i meant:   $('#VMWindows2008R2Platinum-PopUp').dialog({closeOnEscape: true})
[09:14:51] <Bauer> 3+ years right now...
[09:15:38] <shoky> Bauer: and the docs do say it, the example does:  $( "#dialog" ).dialog();   and if you check  the API docs  http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[09:15:52] <shoky> er nevermind
[09:15:54] <Bauer> yup I just saw it! I rushed, read the wrong part :)
[09:16:34] <shoky> anyways it's that way with all the jquery-ui widgets
[09:16:44] <shoky> gotta initialize first
[09:17:33] <Bauer> yeah, I usually (most of the year) work with server side stuff, and normally (suddenly), they decide to do a campaign, and then I need to do a lot of JS work :P thats when I am rusty like now :)
[09:17:45] <shoky> heh
[09:17:58] <Bauer> thanks shoky, I got the hang of the popup now :) just gotta fix few bugs
[09:18:49] <Bauer> shoky: are you internet customer? or cloud services?
[09:18:56] <shoky> np ;] ask away if you run into issues or got any q
[09:19:06] <shoky> just internet
[09:19:37] <shoky> i love not having to talk to anyone, and everything just working almost instantly :P
[09:20:02] <Bauer> yeah shoky, the idea was mine, around 2.5 years ago or more :)
[09:20:09] <shoky> really?
[09:20:11] <Bauer> took a week for the management to agree to fully automate the services
[09:20:16] <doev> how can I pass a forms data to a ajax PUT request?
[09:20:17] <shoky> wow, i love you man
[09:20:50] <Bauer> thanks :) but the disappointing thing is, that 99.9% of the customers dont purchase internet services alone
[09:20:52] <shoky> did you get compensated?!
[09:20:53] <doev> data: $('#fm'). ??
[09:21:10] <shoky> oh
[09:22:04] <Bauer> its interesting, the distance between theory, and business reality.. people still buy over the phone
[09:22:26] <shoky> damn people always get in the way
[09:22:55] <Bauer> oh yeah, they tend to find bugs you never thought are possible :P
[09:23:10] <shoky> heh ;]
[09:23:54] <Bauer> but overall, I am quite pleased with the results - I have very very low (less than 0.5%) failure rate - the autoprovisioning service works exceptionally well
[09:24:49] <shoky> awesome job as far as i'm concerned. you're my employee of the decade
[09:26:04] <Bauer> thanks :) well, customers dont feel it, but the system's code is not the best code ever.. it needs to be redone with better practices sometimes, and its constant struggle to keep things running without problems hehe
[09:26:20] <shoky> heh but it seems that's always the case :)
[09:27:09] <Bauer> The country is the biggest problem.. did you know ISPs must offer you a free web filtering service? this forced us to make patches and changes we did not want. or another directive - to allow the customer to retain his username for 6 month (and email access)
[09:28:24] <shoky> yea they do love to constantly "reform" these stuff
[09:29:29] <Bauer> yeah, I didnt realize this when we first designed and created the system :) now its patches on patches and at some day I want to redo it, to be with best coding standards, and flexible for business requirement changes
[09:30:44] <shoky> i'm all for it :)
[09:31:25] <Bauer> what you do for work shoky?
[09:32:58] <shoky> i work for a small dying company called YCD multimedia, in shfaim. been with them for 10 years :\  currently i mostly work from home and not that much, need to start looking for a real job ;]
[09:33:57] <shoky> oh misread your question ;p  i code backend & frontend there
[09:34:26] <shoky> mostly with ancient technologies ;\
[09:34:39] <Bauer> hey shoky, actually we are looking for someone who does know his way around javascript, css etc :P but also some .NET understanding (mostly for maintaining the various company's websites)
[09:34:43] <shoky> and i do a bit of freelance webdev too
[09:35:23] <Bauer> I did twice some freelance work in PHP, doing payment modules :)
[09:35:51] <shoky> i'll move this to PM, k?
[09:36:08] <Bauer> yeah, my thoughts exactly - 900 ppl should not be our audience :)
[09:44:47] <_JamieD_> Hi, anyone know if it's possible to select an element using a data attribute (e.g. $(".paperwork-row-total[data-tax-rate='21.0']")) after that data attribute has been updated using jquery (e.g. $elm.data('tax-rate', tax_rate))? I'm unable to select elements using a data attribute with the updated attribute value
[09:45:57] <NoiseEee> _JamieD_: if you plan on using your 'data-' stuff as a selector, you need to set it via .attr('data-something',value) and not via .data
[09:46:24] <_JamieD_> NoiseEee: thanks, I'll give that a try now
[09:47:47] <_JamieD_> NoiseEee: works :) thanks
[09:48:21] <NoiseEee> np _JamieD_
[09:52:50] <paulvd> hello, to target window with below 769 I am using if (jQuery(window).width() < 769) {, but what if I want to target windows below 769 but not target windows below 650?
[09:56:57] <BillCriswell> paulvd: && width > 650
[10:04:15] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/    <-- why won't yahoo.com show up in the div?
[10:08:57] <BillCriswell> tables: Different domains.
[10:11:18] <BillCriswell> paulvd: http://jsbin.com/ayerafE/1/edit?js,output I always liked this approach for doing things in JavaScript based on certain media queries.
[10:12:13] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/1/
[10:12:16] <tables> why won't it work now?
[10:12:41] <tables> BillCriswell, ^
[10:13:14] <BillCriswell> tables: Different domains still.
[10:13:21] <BillCriswell> fiddle.jshell.net is the src domain for the result frame.
[10:13:28] <tables> ah
[10:14:10] <tables> how can i keep querying with a timeout?
[10:14:17] <tables> every 2 minutes
[10:14:42] <BillCriswell> setInterval() with 2000 milliseconds.
[10:16:27] <tables> could you show me syntax?
[10:16:34] <tables> $.getJSON('http://jsfiddle.net/HL9Hn/show/', function(data){ $('#myDivId').append(data); });
[10:16:52] <BillCriswell> tables: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setInterval
[10:17:04] <tables> i'm new to jquery that's why
[10:17:06] <tables> and javascript
[10:17:45] <BillCriswell> tables: That's cool. Just read up on the documentation and mess around with it.
[10:18:47] <tables> how can i make it work when i press a <a href=""> ?
[10:19:52] <BillCriswell> tables: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:22:10] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/2/
[10:22:13] <tables> is that correct syntax?
[10:22:20] <tables> for the interval?
[10:22:40] <tables> i need it to work onload
[10:25:58] <BillCriswell> tables: This looks fine. You can just run changeColor(); when the dom is ready.
[10:26:36] <hlve> hey guys? http://pastebin.com/JSTga4tq why isn't my on touchstart being fired the same as the click is?
[10:26:48] <hlve> for some reason it's ignoring the touchstart completely...
[10:27:18] <hlve> :[
[10:27:38] <BillCriswell> hlve: You don't want to do ||. Just doing 'click.deletews 'touchstart.deletews' is plenty.
[10:27:50] <BillCriswell> Er, 'click.deletews touchstart.deletews' *
[10:28:09] <tables> BillCriswell, the code doesn't work on my local server
[10:28:19] <hlve> thanks bill ^^
[10:28:25] <BillCriswell> hlve: Doing 'foo' || 'bar' would return 'foo' every time.
[10:28:42] <b3tamax> Is there a good IRC for help with qunit?
[10:28:54] <tables> http://localhost/foo.html has the jquery code as shown in http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/2/          and http://localhost/bar.html has my html code which is just "<b>hello</b> world"
[10:28:57] <tables> know what's wrong?
[10:29:18] <hlve> BillCriswell touche :). thank you for that.
[10:29:34] <BillCriswell> tables: Open up the dev console and click "network" and see what request is being made.
[10:29:37] <tables> http://paste.debian.net/67711/
[10:29:47] <BillCriswell> hlve: No problem.
[10:31:42] <tables> BillCriswell, no query is made
[10:31:47] <tables> it only queries jquery.min.js
[10:32:11] <tables> http://paste.debian.net/67711/    <-- is asdf.html correct syntax?
[10:33:16] <BillCriswell> tables: You need do this when the document is ready.
[10:33:29] <tables> i don't knwo what that means
[10:33:53] <BillCriswell> tables: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[10:34:13] <BillCriswell> You could also just put the script after your HTML.
[10:37:41] <tables> http://paste.debian.net/67712/   <-- BillCriswell it still won't work
[10:38:24] <BillCriswell> tables: You're still not listening to me. You have to run changeColor().
[10:38:50] <hlve> $(function() { changeColor(); });
[10:38:51] <hlve> <3
[10:40:54] <BillCriswell> tables: Also, huge thing, embarassed I didn't notice it before, but using getJSON won't work.
[10:41:01] <BillCriswell> Just do .get
[10:41:11] <tables> ah
[10:41:37] <hlve> don't be embarresed. you're amazing
[10:41:42] <hlve> *_*
[10:41:48] <BillCriswell> Haha
[10:42:12] <hlve> enjoying dominos for lunch
[10:42:18] <hlve> :]. dat italian sub.
[10:42:58] <zizzl> hey guys if I want to do some animates when a div is "scrolled to" do people use scrollTo() or just the built in scroll()
[10:44:01] <BillCriswell> zizzl: scrollTo might make some things easier, but either way can get you the result you're looking for.
[10:44:50] <tables> BillCriswell, it works like this:   http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/4/       but it doesn't work like this:    http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/5/
[10:44:58] <tables> check it out
[10:46:09] <BillCriswell> tables: It's because you're not calling changeColor()
[10:46:23] <BillCriswell> Just put changeColor() at the bottom of your script.
[10:47:56] <Whiskey> How do i select last td whit jQuery in a table?
[10:49:47] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: .last().
[10:50:03] <tables> can you gimme correct changecolor syntax?
[10:50:15] <tables> to put at the bottom of my script
[10:51:13] <BillCriswell> tables: It's really just changeColor().
[10:52:40] <Whiskey> yeh i found that :D
[10:54:15] <Whiskey> yeh i found that :D
[10:54:38] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[10:54:50] <hlve> Sweet.
[10:54:57] <hlve> (teehee.)
[10:56:24] <BillCriswell> zizzl: This is a pretty basic approach for it I think: http://jsbin.com/ifAGuYEF/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[10:58:15] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: $(id).td:last.css("width", "100%") <-- will that work
[10:59:33] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/6/        <-- how do i make it work only when i click the link?
[10:59:36] <tables> BillCriswell, ^
[11:01:02] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: No.
[11:01:12] <Whiskey> hehe how do i select it whit an ID :D
[11:01:25] <Whiskey> id is a variable in this case ofc
[11:01:44] <BillCriswell> $(id).find('td:last')
[11:02:19] <BillCriswell> tables: You'd attach an event listener to the <a> and put your code in a function.
[11:02:58] <Whiskey> did not work as i wanted
[11:03:02] <Whiskey> ok BillCriswell: last try for today
[11:03:10] <Whiskey> maxWidth <-- is a int how do i get that x2
[11:03:28] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: *
[11:03:44] <tables> BillCriswell, how do i do that?
[11:03:49] <Whiskey> would be something like $(id).find("tr:last").css("width" maxWidth*2"px")
[11:03:59] <BillCriswell> tables: Look at the jQuery documentation for .on
[11:04:21] <Whiskey> would be something like $(id).find("tr:last").css("width" "Width:"maxWidth*2"px")
[11:04:57] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Closer to the first one. .css('width', ( maxWidth * 2 ) + 'px');
[11:05:25] <BillCriswell> tables: http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/7/
[11:05:34] <Whiskey> hehe yeh i would think this "$(id).find("tr:last").css("width" maxWidth*2"px")" <-- looked alot batter
[11:07:00] <Whiskey> did not work ether Bill,guss i have to make a fiddle
[11:10:00] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/ BillCriswell <--- that one
[11:10:55] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: Don't think you mean to be putting it on tr:last ?
[11:11:21] <Whiskey> did you klick on the show button?
[11:11:56] <jedimind> i licked the show button
[11:12:07] <Whiskey> :P'
[11:12:27] <BillCriswell> No, just looked at your code and saw tr:last and something to do with width, which stood out as wrong.
[11:12:35] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: Do that and look at last TD
[11:13:49] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: You want that across both columns?
[11:13:56] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:14:01] <BillCriswell> colspan="2"
[11:14:09] <Whiskey> i hate that damn thing
[11:14:14] <Whiskey> its not anyway to set that in css
[11:14:43] <BillCriswell> It has nothing to do with styling. :-p
[11:14:55] <Zzaichik> ie NO
[11:15:10] <Whiskey> its uggly BillCriswell
[11:15:51] <BillCriswell> Why?
[11:16:02] <Whiskey> BillCriswell; it breaked that code
[11:16:28] <BillCriswell> Whiskey: http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/1/
[11:16:43] <Whiskey> yeh its breaked
[11:16:59] <BillCriswell> Not following.
[11:17:16] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/2/ <--- look at that
[11:17:21] <Whiskey> do you see how less bigger it is?
[11:17:27] <Whiskey> that first thing, its get bigger then its need
[11:17:42] <Whiskey> last thing JS stop working
[11:18:36] <Whiskey> looks like i have to think something else out
[11:19:22] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[11:20:27] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: look at this http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/3/ thats another table so know its two tables
[11:21:03] <Whiskey> the problem there is that its grows for everytime you open/close the box, it should stand at same size everytime
[11:21:22] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/ <-- like that one
[11:26:24] <Whiskey> hard nut to breka
[11:26:56] <hlve> BillCriswell, you breaked all the code? :(
[11:27:47] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/2/ <-- Like that one but not wider
[11:27:50] <Whiskey> can´t be hard to do
[11:27:59] <Whiskey> width is perfect
[11:35:08] <Whiskey> its like impossible
[11:35:36] <Whiskey> if not
[11:37:19] <BillCriswell> block block--block block--block-2 drupal classes sounding like a chicken.
[11:38:13] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: its impossible to get it in same size
[11:40:19] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/4/ BillCriswell: get that last table to fillout the box, and keep that size
[11:42:42] <BillCriswell> Whiskey I'm not sure what size and stuff you're talking about. Plus I kind of have to handle my own stuff now.
[11:42:53] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: if you open the box
[11:43:12] <Whiskey> and close it, it keep the same size, if you get last td to fill out the whole box whitout change the size, you got it correct
[11:43:28] <Whiskey> the box i mean, '
[11:44:48] <Whiskey> the tds, in first table set box size, as its need to be filled out, but box not allowed to get bigger then that, whit other words no uneedes spaces in the line
[11:44:49] <Whiskey> got it?
[11:45:35] <Whiskey> Bill
[11:45:41] <BillCriswell> No thanks.
[11:45:41] <Whiskey> We can make it even more easy
[11:45:46] <BillCriswell> Haha I'm good.
[11:45:48] <BillCriswell> That's all you.
[11:45:51] <Whiskey> Did you got what i eman?
[11:46:35] <Whiskey> hmm maybe make a div of it whitout a table
[11:47:26] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Pd6Bz/5/ <--- BillCriswell: thats really close but not correct
[11:50:42] <SuperTyp> hello I create a website for a friend and I want to use the jquery UI slide function to load new content in by clicking on the menu
[11:51:11] <SuperTyp> for better understand I created a smaller version with jsfiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/F6nvX/4/
[11:52:09] <SuperTyp> in line 12 of the JS you see that I would have to set the click function for every li
[11:52:47] <SuperTyp> this is not satisfying for me
[11:53:28] <SuperTyp> ( actually I have 5 links so its 5! possibilities to cover
[11:53:33] <SuperTyp> )
[11:53:38] <SuperTyp> is there a better way to do this?
[11:56:05] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: i maybe got something that works
[11:57:49] <Erenstnoa> hi
[11:59:18] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: I think colspan can work, but then i need to know how to skip last TD it the calculation in the javascript
[12:04:14] <BillCriswell> $tds.not(':last')
[12:05:36] <diphtherial> hey, is there a variant of .data() that takes a function where 'this' is set to the current thing to which .data() is being applied?
[12:05:42] <diphtherial> there's a version of addClass() that acts like that
[12:06:01] <NoiseEee> diphtherial: has nothing to do with a 'version', has everything to do with the context in which you use it
[12:06:48] <diphtherial> ok, i'm using it over a result set, and i think it's fair to call a particular variant of an overloaded function a 'version'
[12:07:19] <diphtherial> there are versions of addClass() that take a string, for instance, and both the version that takes a function and the version that takes a string are used with a result set
[12:08:45] <diphtherial> *there's a version of addClass()
[12:11:02] <Erenstnoa> hi
[12:11:19] <Erenstnoa> i am trying to get an infinite loop working like this: http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/7/
[12:12:01] <Erenstnoa> why does it require the onLoad option in jsfiddle to loop continously ?
[12:14:12] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: the only thing happening is that the element with class '.infinite-container' is made into a 'waypoint' when the document loads; no loop happening at all.
[12:14:39] <Erenstnoa> :s
[12:14:48] <Erenstnoa> clicked Run ?
[12:14:58] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: or, if i'm misreading your question, you can certainly initialize $('.infinite-container').waypoint('infinite'); at any point after the element is in the DOM
[12:15:22] <Erenstnoa> i think that sounds closer
[12:16:02] <Erenstnoa> tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/9/
[12:16:03] <BillCriswell> Erenstnoa: jsfiddle puts the script stuff in the <head>. If it put it before the closing </body> it woldn't be needed.
[12:16:39] <Erenstnoa> let me try moving it around
[12:17:47] <Erenstnoa> js is best at the foot or head of page?
[12:17:55] <Erenstnoa> i got into a habbit of including it at the bottom
[12:17:55] <Lewix> I would like to rotate an image and save , any good pointers on how to achieve this
[12:18:16] <Lewix> Erenstnoa: use $(document).ready . It's usually best at the foot
[12:18:28] <Ittabraga> yeah, put it in the footer.
[12:18:37] <Erenstnoa> ok this is getting a mess
[12:18:42] <Erenstnoa> from what i have offline
[12:18:56] <SuperTyp>  hello I create a website for a friend and I want to use the jquery UI slide function to load new content in by clicking on the menu for better understand I created a smaller version with jsfiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/F6nvX/4/ in line 12 of the JS you see that I would have to set the click function for every li this is not satisfying for me (actually I have 5 links so its 5! possibilities to cover)   is there a better way to do 
[12:19:28] <Erenstnoa> this is the page am working from : view-source:http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/shortcuts/infinite-scroll/
[12:19:52] <Erenstnoa> even by copying and pasting the source on localhost does not work as it does online :s
[12:20:47] <BillCriswell> Lewix: You can look into canvas.toDataUrl()
[12:21:05] <Lewix> BillCriswell: do you have a link?
[12:21:57] <Erenstnoa> http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/13/
[12:22:02] <Erenstnoa> it loads but does not loop
[12:22:13] <Erenstnoa> i have added the jquery to bottom of the html body
[12:28:22] <Erenstnoa> any help ?
[12:30:14] <diphtherial> Erenstnoa: to clarify, what you mean is that your page isn't behaving like the library you're using says it should after calling .waypoints()
[12:30:33] <diphtherial> not that your code isn't looping, which it of course won't since there's no looping construct (e.g. while, for, etc.) in your code
[12:31:12] <diphtherial> i'm unfortunately unfamiliar with the library you're using, but it'd probably help you to carefully read over the documentation for it to make sure you're doing everything that they specify
[12:31:13] <Erenstnoa> i tried to copy the example and play with code on local machine
[12:31:14] <Siergiey> hi guys
[12:31:20] <Erenstnoa> but copying the code doesnt work
[12:31:20] <Siergiey> is it possible to count the real time of watching html5 <video> tag based movie?
[12:31:23] <Siergiey> regardless what user do with movie
[12:31:30] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: but its working on the fiddle?
[12:31:34] <diphtherial> Erenstnoa: heh, if you can't even get the example to work, then i agree that you're in trouble...
[12:31:35] <Siergiey> (pause, seek, play etc. whatever)
[12:31:48] <Erenstnoa> only when i selected: onLoad  from jsfiddle options
[12:32:37] <diphtherial> strange, the fiddle you posted seems to be working fine for me even after you stuck <script> into the bottom of the page
[12:32:45] <diphtherial> (this is with onLoad disabled)
[12:32:53] <diphtherial> i.e. this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/13/
[12:33:38] <BillCriswell> The amount of over specificity in this stylesheet is ruining my day.
[12:33:45] <Siergiey> helo?
[12:34:17] <Erenstnoa> its really confusing a noob
[12:34:51] <Erenstnoa> there are 2 external resources
[12:35:03] <Erenstnoa> with http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/13
[12:35:17] <Erenstnoa> i just want to get this working offline
[12:35:18] <jedimind> OH MY GOD
[12:35:21] <jedimind> IT SCROLLS FOREVER
[12:35:25] <jedimind> MAKE IT STOP
[12:35:28] <jedimind> JESUS HELP US
[12:35:31] <Erenstnoa> ztop scrolling
[12:35:32] <Erenstnoa> stop
[12:35:52] <jedimind> oh.
[12:35:55] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: working offline?
[12:35:57] <jedimind> well, then
[12:36:02] <Erenstnoa> as in on my pc
[12:36:07] <Erenstnoa> and not in jsfiddle
[12:36:14] <jedimind> you probably need to run it through a web server
[12:36:28] <jedimind> Erenstnoa there are restrictions to what javascript will execute when just viewing it locally in the browser as file:/// something
[12:36:34] <Erenstnoa> i have a local host
[12:36:40] <Erenstnoa> so is that just as good ?
[12:36:57] <Erenstnoa> but even then i cant get the scroll to be infinite
[12:37:07] <diphtherial> it depends on how you're referencing your scripts; if your scripts are available locally and you're using relative references, it'll work
[12:37:32] <diphtherial> if your scripts are available on some other host, as jedimind mentioned your browser will block references to non-local domains when running a local script, for security reasons
[12:37:38] <Erenstnoa> am using full url
[12:37:40] <Erenstnoa> is that wrong?
[12:37:48] <Erenstnoa> arr
[12:37:55] <Erenstnoa> so i need them locals
[12:38:08] <Erenstnoa> lets try :D
[12:38:12] <diphtherial> that's one way to do it; the other, easier way is to run a local webserver and access your page through that
[12:38:13] <Whiskey> BillCriswell: How do i apply that in my code?
[12:38:40] <diphtherial> if you just pop open the html file in your browser, it won't allow you to download and run remote code (at least by default)
[12:38:45] <Erenstnoa> installed a web server to test
[12:39:00] <diphtherial> paste the url that you're using to access your page
[12:39:11] <diphtherial> (that way i can tell you if you've opened it up via the filesystem or via your local webserver)
[12:39:32] * diphtherial thinks he needs coffee :x
[12:39:51] <Erenstnoa> localhost:8888/www/
[12:40:48] <jedimind> COFFEE!
[12:40:50] <jedimind> thats what im missing!
[12:40:52] <jedimind> thanks diphtherial
[12:40:57] <jedimind> this channel is so helpful
[12:41:12] <Whiskey> $(id).eq(0).find("td"); <-- how do i not select last td in that one?
[12:41:20] <Erenstnoa> coffee ?
[12:41:48] <diphtherial> heh :3
[12:42:17] <diphtherial> erm, sorry, i meant that i need coffee...never sure how to use pronouns in a /me...
[12:42:29] <diphtherial> "diphtherial thinks that i need coffee" isn't quite right
[12:42:43] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: maybe post your code to a pastebin
[12:43:04] <diphtherial> Whiskey: $(id).eq(0).find("td").not(":last-child") will work, i think, although it's a bit convoluted
[12:43:06] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: and familiarize yourself with how to debug javascript http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:43:22] <Whiskey> yeh i just found that out :D
[12:43:25] <Whiskey> worked parfect :D
[12:43:30] <diphtherial> nifty :)
[12:43:52] <diphtherial> Erenstnoa: that url's fine, you're accessing it through your local webserver (which i assume is running on 8888)
[12:43:55] <Erenstnoa> thx
[12:44:01] <Erenstnoa> yea
[12:44:03] <Erenstnoa> the page loads
[12:44:07] <Erenstnoa> but with no infinite loop
[12:44:16] <Erenstnoa> i have the js files linked on the server too
[12:45:17] <Erenstnoa> if there is another way of creating an infinite scroll effect ill do that]
[12:45:32] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: maybe post your code to a pastebin
[12:45:35] <NoiseEee> Erenstnoa: and familiarize yourself with how to debug javascript http://fixingthesejquery.com
[12:46:29] <Erenstnoa> got the link open :p
[12:46:45] <Erenstnoa> just eating 1 min, ill try pastebin, but i have lost hope
[12:47:08] <NoiseEee> yeah well you haven't given us much hope either, good luck
[12:49:33] <arxwn> Hello
[12:49:52] <arxwn> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ there are now events in the website api documentation
[12:49:59] <arxwn> what happened to the events?
[12:51:12] <arxwn> Can anyone confirm that the events are missing from the datepicker website documentation?
[13:05:42] <Whiskey> this is not right
[13:06:53] <Whiskey> anyone around?
[13:08:29] <Erenstnoa> if you load this: http://jsfiddle.net/FF2MS/23/   the loop works
[13:08:40] <Erenstnoa> if you hit RUN the loop stops working, why is this?
[13:11:33] <Erenstnoa> here is my pastebin: http://pastebin.com/W5F6W9W1
[13:33:07] <lmao> I have a function that adds a new table row when you click on an element. it works but the function doesn't fire on newly created elements... how can I fix this? $('.add-line-item').on('click', function() {
[13:37:58] <NoiseEee> lmao: $(someParentOfTheTable).on('click','.add-line-item',function() {});
[13:38:19] <NoiseEee> even $(yourTableRefrence) would work lmao
[13:38:33] <NoiseEee> (since a <table> is the parent of all <tr>s)
[13:41:21] <lmao> NoiseEee, thx works
[13:46:42] <bob___> hello
[13:46:46] <bob___> hello
[13:46:57] <NoiseEee> hello bob___
[13:47:21] <bob___> i was wondering if someone could help me out w/ some ajax problem solving
[13:47:38] <NoiseEee> just ask your question to the channel and hopefully someone will pipe up
[13:49:36] <bob___> So I'm making a call to an API that has a limit on the number of returned documents. By default, the maximum per_page is set to 100. Thus, if there are a total of 104 documents, I have to make two calls - one that returns 100 and one that returns 4. What's the best way of going about writing a function that continually makes ajax calls until the # of documents returned is less than 100?
[13:50:55] <NoiseEee> bob___: silly question, but you say 'by default'.  is there no way of setting the limit in the API request itself?
[13:51:52] <bob___> The API does have a per_page option, but is maxed out at 100.
[13:52:14] <bob___> and so as a result I have to make request that look like this - page=0&per_page=100
[13:52:20] <bob___> page=1&per_page=100
[13:52:20] <bob___> etc
[13:54:22] <NoiseEee> well i suppose you can just make your XHR request a function (obviously) where the onComplete method a) puts the results in a variable (array?) to be accessed later  and then b) looks at the result count, if less than 100, call the function again
[13:56:36] <bob___> how would I determine when all the callbacks are executed?
[13:57:40] <clarkfischer> bob___, $.when http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ if you're using deferreds.  Otherwise count the callbacks?
[13:58:57] <NoiseEee> xhr.done(data) { returnedResults.push(data); if(data.returnedResults < 100) { doXHRFunction(); }  }
[13:59:12] <NoiseEee> xhr.done(data) { returnedResults.push(data); if(data.returnedResultCount < 100) { doXHRFunction(); }  }
[13:59:22] <NoiseEee> something like that I would say, but yes deferreds are another option
[14:01:19] <telstar> With a multipage template, how do I script a change of the active page?  I know how to do it when the user clicks a link, but I'd like to do it in response to an AJAX reply using javascript.  Tried:   $.mobile.changePage( "#gameboard", { transition: "slideup"} );  where "game board" is the DIV's ID unsuccessfully.
[14:03:55] <bob___> okay great
[14:03:57] <bob___> i'll try that out
[14:03:58] <bob___> thanks so much
[14:05:42] <NoiseEee> bob___: i think somehow you'd have to use promises in there though.. ie: how does your script know that no more XHR requests are needed, so get on with processing the results
[14:27:35] <bob___> NoiseEee
[14:27:41] <bob___> I just kept passing in callbacks
[14:27:49] <bob___> basically like
[14:28:06] <bob___> if (result < 100) callback(results.concat(data))
[14:28:07] <bob___> else
[14:28:19] <bob___> callsamefunction(page + 1, results.concat(data), cb)
[14:46:11] <shadykhan> if im parsing a feed and it is returning urls is there a way to get the favicon for each urls?

[14:47:29] <tehopeologist> can someone help me out?  it's grabbing the initial image's height instead of the loaded one =/
[15:39:26] <henn1nk> any idea how to realise the collapse menu on page http://www.teamgeek.co.za ? (clicking on the profile images) ... i build something like this, but i don't know how to set the div layer with the collapsed content to full page width :(
[16:05:31] <shoky> <div>s are full width by default ;S
[16:19:51] <thesisb> What is the object generated by something like: $('a') and how can I add to that list, for example $('a') + $('p')?
[16:20:09] <JBreit> Has anyone ever come across some code that preloads images based on the platform display size that sites are being used to view the site?  I have created a polyfill and I am trying to figure out a preloader so it only loads specific images based on the display size for each data-media query
[16:20:44] <JBreit> er picturefill****
[16:21:04] <thesisb> JBreit: im not sure but take a look at the new foundation 5's solution
[16:22:22] <JBreit> any idea what that would be under on their site?
[16:22:52] <thesisb> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/interchange.html
[16:23:16] <JBreit> I kind of wish I had started this out with Foundation from what I hear about it
[16:23:22] <thesisb> :)
[16:23:23] <liamkeily> is this channel for jquery mobile?
[16:23:28] <JBreit> I am not really enjoying Bootstrap
[16:24:47] <liamkeily> i am dynamicaly changing the inner html of a collapsible element (jquery) mobile and cant figure out how to re-render it
[16:25:24] <thesisb> liamkelly what do you mean?
[16:25:39] <liamkeily> i've read your supposed to use .trigger('create') but its not working.. when i run this on the console it returns the html
[16:25:52] <liamkeily> i mean it loses all of the styling
[16:26:25] <thesisb> oh oops, never used jqmobile
[16:26:25] <liamkeily> with listviews i fix this with .listview('refresh') but cant seem to do the same with "Collapsible" elements
[16:31:52] <kingbeowolf> how can i display a vimeo video as a certain size when in a desktop but small on a  mobile device?
[16:32:23] <thesisb> kingbeowolf: media queries
[16:33:01] <thesisb> or actually, maybe that video needs some JS, where you calculate a size based on $(window).width() and $(window).height()
[16:35:18] <rosieres> I´ve got a funny behaviour in all IE´s. I have a menu where the sub ul´s are a bit apart from the following UL´s. If I hover the first li´s the hidden ul is shown. To make the hover work even if I´m in the apart area I have set the li with an padding-bottom and a transparent background. In IE the hover does not work in the apart area as long I´ve set the background to transparent. If I put a color it works. Is that a known issue with a
[16:35:20] <rosieres>  best practice workaround ?
[16:38:59] <thesisb> If I have var a = $('a') and I then want to add all the <p> elements to var a, how can I do it?
[16:40:59] <shoky> thesisb: a = a.add('p')

[16:45:44] <Consolas> I have a little problem. I have a dialog working fine, it gets opened and has some stuff inside. From within that dialog, I have a link that it's another dialog. I'm trying to just do something like "previous_dialog".dialog("close)"; "next_dialog".dialog("open");
[16:45:58] <Consolas> the "new" dialog opens just to get instantly closed (from what I think the previous close action)
[16:46:00] <Consolas> any tips?
[16:47:09] <thesisb> you're binding the open and close twice, or to the wrong elements, or to the same elements.
[16:47:13] <thesisb> hard to say without seeing it
[16:48:47] <thesisb> same element*
[16:49:48] <Consolas> appreciate your answer. I'll just past bin a quick example
[16:50:32] <shoky> Consolas: http://jsfiddle.net/5Qd3H/
[16:51:39] <Consolas> http://pastebin.com/haSJ8Ld3
[16:51:43] <Consolas> for instance
[16:52:07] <Consolas> oh nice, yes, that is the behavior I want
[16:52:11] <Consolas> thank you for that
[16:53:29] <shoky> you shouldn't add event listeners in the "open" callback, it might get called more than once
[16:53:48] <shoky> i also see you're binding the same event handlers for the same elements in both open callbacks..
[16:54:00] <Consolas> that is what I Was checking right now, yes
[16:54:20] <Consolas> but that is bind to the overlay
[16:54:23] <Consolas> so it might be a problem
[16:54:27] <Consolas> but not this problem, no?
[16:54:47] <shoky> i don't know. make a jsfiddle if you wanna show a problem
[16:57:43] <henn1nk> any idea how to realise the collapse menu on page http://www.teamgeek.co.za ? (clicking on the profile images) ... i build something like this, but i don't know how to set the div layer with the collapsed content to full page width :(
[16:58:16] <shoky> henn1nk: divs are full width by default. you'll have to show the problem you're having if you want help (preferably a jsfiddle demo)
[16:58:38] <henn1nk> shoky: yes but they just use the parent width
[16:59:06] <shoky> the offset-parent, yes
[17:03:58] <henn1nk> shoky: i make an fiddle example, wait
[17:05:55] <henn1nk> shoky: is coffeescript ok?
[17:06:26] <shoky> it's less ok, but if you must then ok;p
[17:06:53] <shoky> thought this was a css problem :S
[17:09:10] <henn1nk> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/73hqg/1/
[17:09:26] <meowsus> Does anyone see a better way I can refactor this function? https://gist.github.com/meowsus/7651809
[17:09:27] <henn1nk> shoky: but i would like to have the green div with full width :/
[17:10:31] <meowsus> I mean, it's not live or die, but when I see that much redundancy I feel like there's a better way to do it.
[17:10:56] <Mrgoose> any of you use iscrollview?
[17:11:35] <meowsus> Mrgoose: I've used iScroll before
[17:11:51] <Mrgoose> oh ok, needed some help with the mobile version
[17:12:48] <meowsus> Mrgoose: iScroll is "the mobile version" effectually. What are you trying to do?
[17:13:07] <henn1nk> or any other idea to archieve this? :(
[17:13:26] <Mrgoose> well when i swipe on the IscrollView for some reason that gets registered as iscroll_onscrollmove
[17:13:29] <Mrgoose> and im trying to prevent that
[17:15:11] <meowsus> Mrgoose: couldn't you just listen for iscroll_onscrollmove and return false?
[17:16:06] <meowsus> document.addEventListener('iscroll_onscrollmove', function () { return false });
[17:16:14] <meowsus> Then again, I'm not sure what your endgame is.
[17:17:51] <Consolas> thanks for the input guys
[17:18:00] <Consolas> I found out the issue, it had to do with a fade
[17:18:10] <Consolas> both dialogs had a fade when closing
[17:18:26] <Consolas> and probably the fade would end AFTER the otther dialog opened, so both dialogs were actually getting closed
[17:23:46] <shoky> henn1nk: http://jsfiddle.net/73hqg/2/
[17:25:00] <henn1nk> shoky: hm is there a way to slide up in the same row?
[17:25:13] <henn1nk> shoky: in your example 1/2/3 clicking just "changes" text
[17:25:31] <shoky> henn1nk: what? it doesn't just change the text, it shows a different div
[17:25:43] <henn1nk> shoky: but not visible :)
[17:25:55] <shoky> oh
[17:26:05] <henn1nk> shoky: would be nice that the old open div is always "slided up" before changing the div
[17:26:21] <shoky> henn1nk http://jsfiddle.net/73hqg/3/
[17:27:17] <henn1nk> shoky: and there is no other way? i don't know how, but http://www.teamgeek.co.za/#who has the content in the same div
[17:28:00] <shoky> donno what you mean
[17:28:30] <shoky> they are replacing the content dynamically, instead of showing and hiding different divs
[17:28:44] <shoky> simple to do
[17:30:30] <henn1nk> shoky: on your version i am "fixed" to use for example 3 objects in a row.. but would be nice to be more dynamic
[17:32:24] <shoky> then change it to work the way you want it, or pay someone to do it for you ;p
[17:32:52] <henn1nk> shoky: :P
[17:33:11] <henn1nk> shoky: if i would know how to make it work so i would do it :P
[17:33:29] <henn1nk> shoky: but the main problem is that a div just uses the parents width :P
[17:34:47] <jarray52> With Jquery reveal, does anyone know how to fix the background opaqueness with IE8? The background is completely black. Not translucent as in the other browsers.
[17:34:47] <shoky> well i just showed that that's not really a problem if you structure it differently
[17:37:06] <jarray52> shoky: Was that comment directed at me?
[17:37:29] <henn1nk> shoky: yeah of course :)
[17:37:46] <shoky> jarray52 nope
[17:38:14] <jarray52> shoky: Thanks.
[17:41:58] <darkfrog> when I call $(...).position().left on a relative positioned element I *should* be getting back 0 but I'm getting back the absolute position instead (the same value as $(...).offset().left).  Can anyone tell me why and how to determine the relative position properly?
[17:42:08] <henn1nk> shoky: is var $this = $(this) faster?
[17:42:53] <shoky> henn1nk:  if you're gonna call $(this) a lot then yes. no need to call the jquery function again and again
[17:43:01] <henn1nk> ok
[17:50:18] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: I can't replicate that.
[17:51:11] <meowsus> BillCriswell: Hey buddy ;)
[17:51:29] <BillCriswell> Yoooooo
[17:51:41] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: http://dev.outr.com:8889/example/coordinates.html  type: $('#div1').position().left into the console
[17:52:28] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: it doesn't seem to actually be the position: relative, but rather inclusive to static as well
[17:55:15] <darkfrog> running jQuery 1.10.2
[17:56:22] <henn1nk> shoky: is there an easy way to move the more elements on a higher div level?
[17:57:54] <henn1nk> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/g7Jgb/
[17:57:55] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: Sorry got sidetracked haha. Taking a look.
[17:58:31] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: no worries, I'm patient. :)
[17:58:48] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: thus far Google and jQuery docs have not been helpful
[17:59:10] <darkfrog> ...I've found a few bugs that might be what I'm seeing but bugs.jquery.com seems to be down
[18:00:15] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: http://jsbin.com/iTEZuToz/1/edit?html,css,js,output should explain it.
[18:01:07] <BillCriswell> I think it's just the lack of position: relative on a parent that's causing that behavior?
[18:02:07] <BillCriswell> Er, not behavior.. but... wrong number? I'm not much of a word man.
[18:05:22] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: Not sure the documentation is really clear here now that I'm reading through.
[18:08:27] <BillCriswell> http://dribbble.com/shots/1323883-Discuss/attachments/186270 This is snazzy. I want to build it.
[18:10:52] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: that is to say you have no answer to my problem? :o
[18:12:17] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: I thought I answered. You need position: relative; on the parent you want to calculate it from. This demo kind of illustrates it: http://jsbin.com/iTEZuToz/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:18:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi all
[18:20:02] <BillCriswell> Ayyyy
[18:21:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> waht you up to BillCriswell
[18:22:56] <darkfrog> BillCriswell: okay, I see...that kinda sucks
[18:26:20] <henn1nk> shoky: hm i don;t get it
[18:28:28] <BillCriswell> darkfrog: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3202008/jquery-difference-between-position-and-offset first answer here seems good.
[18:31:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: bro you ther?
[18:45:17] <raj> is it faster to do `$('#container .items').addClass('hide'); $myitem.removeClass('hide')`, or `$("#container .item:not('hide')").addClass('hide'); $myitem.removeClass('hide')` ?
[18:48:24] <raj> ugh, I goofed in that example...
[18:48:39] <raj> is it faster to do `$('#container .items').addClass('hide'); $myitem.removeClass('hide')`, or `$("#container .items:not('.hide')").addClass('hide'); $myitem.removeClass('hide')` ?
[18:48:47] <raj> there we go
[18:51:05] <shoky> raj it prolly doesn't matter. i'd go with your first option, or possibly $('#container .items').not( $myitem ).addClass('hide')
[18:51:48] <shoky> or possibly $('#container .items').toggleClass('hide') ;p
[18:52:41] <raj> kk
[18:52:43] <raj> thank you shoky
[18:53:00] <shoky> heehee
[18:56:44] <raj> shoky, or mark the previous one as ".current" and then find .current and add 'hide' onto it?
[18:56:55] <raj> so I do'nt have to find the single one without 'hide'
[18:57:42] <raj> and I don' thave to add .hide to all the items, and then remove .hide from the one I care about now
[18:58:02] <shoky> can't really answer that for you, whatever's more convenient for you for how you're doing things
[18:58:22] <raj> why can't you read my mind yet, shoky
[18:58:40] <raj> help here is horrendous
[18:59:17] <shoky> i might have a chrome extension that'll let me do that
[18:59:45] <shoky> installation might be a little unpleasant for you
[18:59:58] <raj> haha
[19:00:03] <raj> whatever it takes
[19:00:37] <shoky> k initiating_
[19:11:26] <beeker1121> hey guys, does anyone know why this errors out as 'unterminated string literal'? banging my head against the wall... var obj = {"string": "</script>"};  if you use anything else, like </body>, <//script>, etc it works... here's a jsfiddle to test it out http://jsfiddle.net/jAcLn/
[19:12:33] <BillCriswell> <\/script> should do it.
[19:13:45] <beeker1121> @BillCriswell that does work, however i do not understand why.. if it was the forward slash, then why would replacing it with </body> still work? also, if i use <\/script>, is it going to output it as <\/script> or </script>? i might just have to test that
[19:14:50] <BillCriswell> beeker1121: The browser just thinks the script tag is ending.
[19:15:06] <beeker1121> oh wow
[19:15:07] <BillCriswell> beeker1121: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4417749/unterminated-string-literal-error might help
[19:15:08] <beeker1121> hahahahha
[19:15:18] <beeker1121> ok that makes sense... i feel like a noob now
[19:16:08] <beeker1121> i was reading that you can't have </script> in a string inside a script tag, however i thought the browser would be able to differentiate... guess not
[19:16:10] <beeker1121> thanks so much man
[19:16:29] <BillCriswell> beeker1121: Makes two of us. I had to look it up. I was just familiar with the problem.
[19:16:34] <BillCriswell> Have to run. Take it easy!
[19:16:40] <beeker1121> you too
[19:23:35] <hugo_m> hello i have a problem thats been bothering for 5 hours now.  i have a fancy box popup that popups up, and there is margin all around the popup so you can see the body background.  when i place my finger on the margin area and scroll, no matter what tag i use, the touch move is not fired and i can't prevent default on it
[19:23:59] <hugo_m> this is on the iPhone iOS 7
[19:25:20] <hugo_m> i tried using window, a class for the body, parent.$jq191( .class on body )
[19:25:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: how is your pop up setup
[19:26:11] <hugo_m> its an iframe
[19:26:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> first of all do you want it to scroll
[19:26:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> why are you using ifrmae for popup
[19:26:35] <hugo_m> i don't the margin area to allow scrolling of the body
[19:26:43] <hugo_m> dont want
[19:27:04] <hugo_m> if i place my fingers in the little 15px margin area, the body scrolls
[19:27:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[19:27:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> first
[19:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> what type of popup
[19:27:22] <hugo_m> i don't know why no touch move is activated
[19:27:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it like an ad
[19:27:27] <hugo_m> iframe popup
[19:27:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> as in ad from external site
[19:27:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> or just a notification
[19:27:48] <hugo_m> same site
[19:27:53] <hugo_m> just a popup of a product
[19:28:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[19:28:11] <hugo_m> the iframe is added to the body, and inside the iframe is the document etc
[19:28:20] <hugo_m> it has something to do with the parent?
[19:28:24] <hugo_m> i dont understand
[19:28:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: give me a sec im creating a fiddle
[19:28:48] <hugo_m> ok
[19:28:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> are you usign qjeury ui?
[19:28:53] <hugo_m> no
[19:28:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> or jquery mobile?
[19:28:58] <hugo_m> just query and fancybox
[19:28:59] <hugo_m> nope
[19:29:07] <hugo_m> jquery 1.9.1
[19:29:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> only jquqery 1.9.1
[19:29:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> *jquery
[19:29:23] <hugo_m> yea
[19:29:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw we are at 1.10.2
[19:29:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> right now
[19:29:37] <hugo_m> yea
[19:32:39] <hugo_m> I'm curious to find out why the body doesn't fire the touch move. if i click on an area in the popup, it activates $jq191( window ).touchmove so it has to be something with the parent and window context or whatever
[19:32:50] <hugo_m> i don't know too much about this area with frames and all
[19:33:19] <hugo_m> its driven me nuts
[19:35:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold im creating a popup
[19:35:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> so that you can simulate your issue
[19:35:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold
[19:35:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> first
[19:35:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> ifrmaes never good for popups
[19:35:24] <hugo_m> k thanks
[19:35:32] <hugo_m> how come?
[19:35:40] <hugo_m> i see that now hehe
[19:36:07] <hugo_m> oh
[19:36:11] <hugo_m> now i remember the reason
[19:36:19] <hugo_m> i use iframe,
[19:36:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> why
[19:36:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw popup fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Q675K/
[19:37:07] <hugo_m> its because I'm using magenta, and all the popups are for the product pages, and the product pages are separate html files
[19:37:11] <hugo_m> thank you!
[19:37:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Q675K/1/
[19:38:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: so why cant you just grab a single iamge
[19:38:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> as an ad and then make an image link that links to the page
[19:38:33] <hugo_m> i like the popup to show on the same page
[19:38:35] <hugo_m> about the products
[19:38:45] <hugo_m> its a product info popup
[19:39:22] <hugo_m> hmm i need it to work with an iframe
[19:39:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> well basically you do the container i did
[19:39:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then you put iframe inside of content
[19:39:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> inside #popup
[19:40:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: it should work for your iframe
[19:40:22] <hugo_m> right thats not the issue
[19:40:35] <hugo_m> the issue is the margin area doesn't fire the touchmove
[19:40:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> margin area?
[19:40:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> screenshot?
[19:40:58] <hugo_m> in your jsfiddle
[19:41:11] <hugo_m> the area beyond the popup
[19:41:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> around it
[19:41:24] <hugo_m> yea
[19:41:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> you want that scrolable or not?
[19:41:34] <hugo_m> not scrollable
[19:41:49] <hugo_m> but because its an iframe i think there is an issue with the parent
[19:41:51] <hugo_m> or something
[19:42:17] <hugo_m> if i click on the popup, the $jq191( window ).on( 'touch move') fires
[19:42:28] <hugo_m> but if i put my fingers on the area around it
[19:42:40] <hugo_m> i can't get it to fire the touch move, so i can prevent default on it
[19:42:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: i am beginning to understand whatyou mean
[19:42:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Q675K/3/
[19:43:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont think i frame is the issue
[19:43:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> to elimate that possibility
[19:43:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> try using a regular div with content
[19:43:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> but as illustrated i nthe fiddle about
[19:43:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> *above
[19:43:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> i still think the problem remains
[19:44:11] <hugo_m> the touch move won't fire on the body
[19:44:15] <hugo_m> on the iphone
[19:44:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: lol i think i figured it out
[19:44:21] <hugo_m> it might be an iPhone bug
[19:44:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/Q675K/4/
[19:44:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> check my css
[19:44:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> and see the first few lines of the css
[19:44:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> do you have a reset lie that
[19:44:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> *like
[19:45:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: verify that you have a reset like mine
[19:45:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> that may get rid of white margin
[19:45:45] <hugo_m> no thats not the issue
[19:45:49] <hugo_m> i want the margin
[19:45:59] <hugo_m> i have put the margin on purpose so i can see the background
[19:46:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> why?
[19:46:30] <hugo_m> by design
[19:46:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> so then but a white border
[19:46:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> on the popup container
[19:46:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> that way background is still not scrollable
[19:47:16] <hugo_m> you mean an overlay?
[19:47:20] <hugo_m> it already has an overlay
[19:47:24] <hugo_m> this is an iPhone issue
[19:47:31] <hugo_m> mobile
[19:47:41] <hugo_m> it works in chrome
[19:47:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[19:47:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> do you have a screenshot i could look at
[19:48:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause i think i understand your issue
[19:48:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> but then again I feel like im missing something
[19:48:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> remember mobile is very different from how chrome reacts to stuff
[19:49:08] <malibu> I have a stack of divs in my sidebar that are generated by a query in my server.  How do I keep track of which div goes to which item so that I can show details for that item when it is clicked on?
[19:49:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: considering creating a custom attribute
[19:49:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> that directs to a certain item with a certain class
[19:50:19] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: Ok thanks, I will google that
[19:50:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> its used by plugins for organizing protoflio work in a creative way
[19:50:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> see http://isotope.metafizzy.co/
[19:51:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: particularly
[19:51:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/filtering.html
[19:53:19] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: Hm.. that isn't html4 standard
[19:53:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: what you need the html4 standard for
[19:54:07] <malibu> wondering if it is supported back to ie-7
[19:55:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> custom attribtes
[19:56:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7846613/html-data-attribute-ie6-support
[19:56:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: also http://caniuse.com/#search=dataset
[19:57:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> it should work in 7
[19:57:14] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: ok perfect thanks
[19:57:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: why are you still supporting <ie8 any ways :P
[19:58:26] <malibu> ie7 is still more than 1% of the world
[19:58:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:58:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> main i hate those users
[19:58:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is why i am beginning to like mobile
[19:58:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> not as much real estate as web
[19:58:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> desktop
[19:59:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> bu hell they all adopted webkit
[19:59:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> well for the most part
[19:59:13] <randomdrake> ?
[20:00:00] <malibu> Actually my mistake, ie7 is below 1%
[20:00:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:00:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> randomdrake: ??what you confused about
[20:00:53] <malibu> They are currently waiting for ie8 to drop below 1%
[20:00:54] <randomdrake> Rohan_Bhangui: "mobile" doesn't mean much. It's really about screen size and... that isn't webkit or otherwise specific
[20:01:24] <malibu> ie8 is 10% worldwide
[20:01:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> well whne i say mobile im refering to the common features such as webkit
[20:01:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways to rephrase
[20:01:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> randomdrake: i like mobile web programming cause i can use all webkit stuff
[20:01:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats the point
[20:02:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: where you getting states
[20:02:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> *stats
[20:02:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: according to statcounter
[20:03:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> well they have somethign pretty interesting

[20:04:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: how goes the struggle
[20:04:34] <hugo_m> not good
[20:04:40] <hugo_m> do you have an iPhone?
[20:06:07] <malibu> Rohan_Bhangui: It was from ie8browsercountdown or something like that
[20:06:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[20:06:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> let the countdown begin
[20:06:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_mnot so
[20:06:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: not so but i can get emulator running
[20:07:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> hugo_m: give me the link
[20:07:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> malibu: that count down is also useful for one more thing

[20:16:19] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/6/    <-- how can i make that link send that .get request?
[20:16:30] <tables> instead of doing it onlload\
[20:16:33] <tables> onload*
[20:19:49] <monk3y> tables: $(document).on('click', '#myDivId', function() { $.get.. [etc] } );
[20:49:04] <tables> monk3y, can you show me the full syntax for that $get?
[20:51:39] <monk3y> tables: uh, the call you had *looked* fine as I skimmed it, so was just implying you should just keep what you've got in there.
[20:53:57] <monk3y> tables: your question was how to make that $.get happen on click, instead of onload, so I assumed that the get worked and you were comfortable with it - you just needed it on-click.  So I gave you the on-click wrapper
[20:55:03] <monk3y> tables: you'll also have to consider preventing the default click action of the <a> element, or preferably removing the href, or using another element to display the text and react to the link.  Using an <a> with a dummy anchor is naughty.
[21:11:06] <myndzi> anybody know of a deal to let you manage an image gallery with perhaps some basic editing capability? (crop, blur)
[21:11:21] <myndzi> upload/delete/etc
[21:20:39] <birdsnacks> i see some plugins provide additional easing equations - is there a relatively simple way for me to supply my own anonymous function to compute the easing? http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[21:27:37] <tables> monk3y, you showed me the $.get syntax with ... [etc]
[21:27:39] <tables> how do i make it work?
[21:27:42] <tables> lol
[21:27:43] <tables> i'm new to jquery and js

[21:51:46] <jquerynoob> help!
[21:54:15] <vladikoff> jquerynoob, oh no! post your question!
[21:54:58] <jquerynoob> ah...very good!
[21:55:17] <jquerynoob> Thanks vladikoff for responding.
[21:55:26] <vladikoff> cheers!
[21:56:36] <jquerynoob> OK...got a problem with an interval "queuing"
[21:57:15] <jquerynoob> ...pulling up code now.   sorry for the delay
[21:57:30] <uznar> 'lo all, is this even possible? a simple HTML page with some jquery goodness mixed with Infinite Scrolling, fetching photos from via WebDAV source.
[21:58:26] <jquerynoob> :) Got a SQL query running in a PHP which send output to a $_SESSION variable.  Then...
[21:58:48] <jquerynoob> jquery calls the php to get the results of the query....
[21:59:11] <jquerynoob> query runs for 5 minutes....browser locks up.  Doh!
[21:59:24] <bobbobbins> does the php run faster?
[21:59:49] <bobbobbins> meaning, is the javascript causing the lock up, or the php?(or the sql)
[22:00:22] <jquerynoob> PHP takes longer...can I send a PDF in IRC.   been too long!!!
[22:00:57] <bobbobbins> why would you send a pdf?
[22:01:01] <jquerynoob> Got a problem description already written up...would be easier to share

[22:04:50] <vladikoff> what have you done

[22:05:35] <bobbobbins> yeah, any of those, just don't paste into here
[22:06:02] <VectorX> jquerynoob you dont look like you are qualified to use a computer, dont think you should be writing code
[22:06:44] <jquerynoob> I was qualified I guess back in the days when I tied up my parent's phone line sharing 20K porno pictures.
[22:07:09] <jquerynoob> no offense meant.
[22:10:01] <VectorX> jquerynoob you might also want to paste the code for your php file
[22:11:25] <jquerynoob> well....since I've already violated a cardinal rule of IRC...perhaps someone could tell me how to prevent the pasted code from going rouge on me...
[22:11:41] <VectorX> do you not have any common sense ?
[22:12:24] <VectorX> go to http://pastebin.com/  then paste the code in the large box where it says New Paste , submit and give us the link
[22:12:25] <jquerynoob> *sigh*
[22:12:50] <jquerynoob> going now...
[22:13:22] <VectorX> this is another site http://jsfiddle.net/ which is used to run js in real time, if you fix your code you can post the bits in there and people here can help debug
[22:13:36] <VectorX> with jsfiddle you have to save and give us the link
[22:16:17] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/6/   <-- can someone fix this so that it'll send the GET request when i click the link?
[22:17:20] <jquerynoob> http://pastebin.com/download.php?i=4hHMrimq
[22:18:36] <jquerynoob> Here....   http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=4hHMrimq
[22:19:14] <VectorX> tables http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/8/
[22:19:55] <VectorX> jquerynoob how difficult is it to just copy the url from the browser and paste it in here ?
[22:20:32] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/8/    <-- how do i make it so that everytime i click the button, it comes before, instead of after in the div?
[22:20:37] <tables> or new divs that come up before
[22:21:00] <jquerynoob> I've provided two...pick whichever you prefer.
[22:25:10] <xqo> hey
[22:27:14] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/8/    <-- how do i make it so when i click the link, the GET response shows up before in the div, instead of after in the div?
[22:27:57] <Betal> anyone have idea how can I fix this? ( http://jsfiddle.net/7GqLg/ ) Iam trying to get a attribute from the <option> and put it in the equivalent input
[22:29:18] <Betal> tables: try .before() in place of .append()
[22:29:38] <xqo> how do you bind to "user pressed enter or otherwise submitted something"? http://jsfiddle.net/37bNU/
[22:31:47] <vladikoff> xqo, http://api.jquery.com/submit/#entry-examples
[22:32:56] <xqo> vladikoff so whats wrong with mine?
[22:33:07] <xqo> oh
[22:33:11] <xqo> you bind the form, not the input
[22:34:23] <xqo> thanks vladikoff
[22:35:17] <Bala_> I want to know basiccs
[22:35:43] <vladikoff> Bala_, http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/challenges/1
[22:36:19] <jquerynoob>  ? help ?
[22:37:31] <bobbobbins> jquerynoob: you still need help?
[22:37:51] <jquerynoob> yep.
[22:37:56] <bobbobbins> whats the question again?
[22:38:01] <jquerynoob> :)
[22:38:36] <jquerynoob> http://pastebin.com/embed_js.php?i=4hHMrimq
[22:41:28] <bobbobbins> so why can't jquery access return_session_vars.php until the query completes?
[22:42:21] <jquerynoob> The query....query.php looped in an iframe (not visible).  Script has to complete before control is passed back to index.html...apparently.
[22:42:56] <jquerynoob> The PHP script has to complete that is.
[22:43:07] <Betal> anyone have an idea how can I fix this? ( http://jsfiddle.net/7GqLg/ ) Iam trying to get a attribute from the <option> and put it in the equivalent input
[22:43:30] <bobbobbins> why is that script running at all? does it have anything to do with whats on the page?
[22:44:51] <jquerynoob> The query.php script runs a variable number of database queries.  The results of which get stored in the a $_SESSION global variable.  jquery accesses the return_session_vars.php script to get the results of each query.
[22:46:17] <jquerynoob> When the variable $_SESSION[execute_sql] get set to 0, meaning that there are no more queries, jquery should stop attempting to refresh the DIV.  The problem is...
[22:46:28] <bobbobbins> it seems like you're just going about it the wrong way all together...
[22:46:40] <jquerynoob> ....perhaps.  :)
[22:47:54] <jquerynoob> jquery...a client side script cannot, obviously, cannot access a server side variable.  Is there a better way?
[22:48:48] <bobbobbins> node.js?
[22:49:20] <jquerynoob> Is there a way to determine if "$(\'#results\').load(\blah, blah, blah"  is queued to run more than once?!?!?
[22:50:49] <bobbobbins> i dunno, i suck at that stuff
[22:53:43] <jquerynoob> I know that "queues" can be referenced for animations.  Can the same not be referenced for refreshing a DIV?
[22:54:25] <bobbobbins> so you're updating a div with data from a bunch of queries that are running in the background?
[22:54:58] <jquerynoob> you got it.
[22:55:00] <vladikoff> Betal, sec
[22:55:35] <bobbobbins> seems like you need a listener...backbone or something is good for that, when the dataset changes, it'll automatically update your view
[22:55:39] <jquerynoob> ...and I don't know how many or how long they are going to take to complete.
[22:57:22] <jquerynoob> I can reference a PHP that will tell me if the result set has changed and only pull the HTML from the PHP if it has changed.  It helps, but even the multiple (i.e, hundreds) of requests to even determine if the result set has changed created a queue of jquery requests.
[22:59:09] <jquerynoob> ...which causes an unacceptable load on the user's browser if a query takes a long time to complete.
[22:59:26] <bobbobbins> jquerynoob: use a callback so that another jquery request doesn't start until the previous one is done
[23:01:52] <vladikoff> Betal, maybe something like this http://jsfiddle.net/7GqLg/3/
[23:01:57] <xqo> im trying to create a dynamic page, but it reloads every time i submit something. How do i get around that? http://jsfiddle.net/37bNU/2/
[23:02:50] <xqo> http://jsfiddle.net/37bNU/3/
[23:03:10] <jquerynoob> bobbobbins...I think you might have pointed me in the right direction.
[23:04:01] <bobbobbins> whew
[23:04:12] <dfletcher> xqo, http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[23:04:30] <xqo> thanks dfletcher, that worked!
[23:04:42] <dfletcher> :)
[23:05:16] <xqo> i want to insert <divs>
[23:05:34] <VectorX> Betal you could try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/7GqLg/4/
[23:05:39] <xqo> but i mean it could be inserting divs for days, how many divs can you put on a page before it gets seriously slow and it becomes a problem?
[23:05:58] <VectorX> Betal although becuase of the change event if you select the first item it will not select it coz there is no change
[23:08:38] <Betal> vladikoff and VectorX: really nice, thanks :)
[23:10:17] <jquerynoob> It bobbobins: looks like updateDiv() already utilizes a callback function.   agree
[23:10:19] <jquerynoob> ??
[23:13:09] <tables> http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/8/   <-- how do i make the get queries come out before everytime, instead of after?
[23:18:21] <bobbobbins> jquerynoob: yup, looks like it
[23:19:29] <VectorX> tables http://jsfiddle.net/fea6V/10/
[23:20:53] <jquerynoob> But a single DIV .load call prior to the callback would result in the situation I'm describing.  Correct?
[23:23:32] <bobbobbins> jquerynoob: i'd remove the setInterval and just recall updateDiv in checkExecuteSql with a delay on it
[23:24:09] <bobbobbins> that way it doesn't queue up, it only executes after the callback
[23:27:18] <jquerynoob> Good call bobbobbins.
[23:29:37] <jquerynoob> Thanks for your help.  Much appreciated!
[23:31:59] <bobbobbins> yup, no problem
[23:33:29] <Bauer> guys, I have a problem here: if you go to https://cloud-dev.ccccloud.com/index.php?service=vm press VM, then say Win 2008, and then click on "Details" text to open a jQuery UI dialog, then close it, reopen and repeat few times - eventually it starts to get stuck, leaving parts of the dialog open
[23:33:34] <Bauer> why is that happening?
[23:33:53] <Bauer> sometimes it even happens on the first "Details" click
[23:42:54] <patsToms> greetings. I am appending inputs to form. When I want to use $.last() after then - last input is not the apended one, but one I had before
