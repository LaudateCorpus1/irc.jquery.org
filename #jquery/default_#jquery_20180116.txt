[00:57:16] <BigTymer37> hi can somone help me with a drop down menu
[00:58:08] <BigTymer37> i cant get a dropdown menu to work
[01:14:47] <Woet> BigTymer37: so show your code on jsfiddle
[01:18:53] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=tPJOLH3LBt
[01:20:48] <BigTymer37> uhh i cant get it
[01:21:06] <Woet> am i the only one who hates "together" fiddles
[01:22:22] <BigTymer37> can you help me
[01:22:24] <BigTymer37> with my jquery
[01:23:27] <Woet> please turn it into an actual jsfiddle (not a "together" one)
[01:23:34] <Woet> with an actual question
[01:23:39] <Woet> not just "can you help"
[01:24:42] <BigTymer37> i have never used jfiddle
[01:25:08] <Woet> just put the CSS, JS and HTML of your test case there
[01:28:21] <BigTymer37> i put html js and html
[01:28:38] <BigTymer37> the css is called in via bootstrap
[01:28:40] <BigTymer37> and bootswatch
[01:28:52] <BigTymer37> i just really need help with the jquery
[01:29:33] <Woet> thats why i said test case
[01:29:35] <Woet> not your entire website.
[01:35:32] <BigTymer37> ok i am done
[01:43:18] <Woet> so now share your jsfiddle..
[02:14:42] <Cork> BigTymer37: hit the save button in jsfiddle and paste the new url you get here
[02:15:43] <Woet> i like to think of pastebins as aptitude tests
[02:15:48] <Woet> if you can't figure it out you're not ready for coding
[02:16:43] <Cork> Woet: please tone down the aggressiveness it isn't called for
[02:16:56] <Woet> you consider that aggressive?
[02:16:59] <Woet> have you never been outside?
[02:18:24] <Cork> sitting and verbally abuse ppl constantly cause they ask for help isn't needed; and it makes the channel feel hostile for no good reason
[02:18:59] <Woet> it's not constant nor is it because they ask for help
[02:19:05] <Woet> and do you disagree?
[02:19:11] <Cork> i do
[02:19:37] <Woet> alright, maybe it's just in my world, but i've never met someone who knows how to code and not know how to use a pastebin
[02:20:21] <Cork> well open your eyes then, there are plenty of ppl, and just cause they don't natually know how to handle a site doesn't mean they don't know what they're doing
[02:20:39] <Woet> i'll agree to disagree
[02:21:03] <Cork> then stop
[02:21:13] <Cork> if you can't play nice just shut up
[02:21:39] <Woet> i help countless people, most of them seem quite happy
[02:21:51] <Cork> and you insule about two for every one you help...
[02:21:58] <Woet> thats not true
[02:22:06] <BigTymer37> i can get it to drop down the menu now
[02:22:09] <BigTymer37> but it doesnt stay
[02:22:10] <BigTymer37> with a hover
[02:22:20] <Woet> nor are they insults
[02:22:30] <Cork> BigTymer37: please provide a jsfiddle so we can see the code
[02:22:37] <BigTymer37> ok
[02:23:34] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=HKmun0SRqv
[02:23:39] <Cork> hit save
[02:23:58] <BigTymer37> k done
[02:24:02] <Cork> then the new link
[02:24:19] <Cork> if it ends with /#&togetherjs=<something> it isn't of any use to us
[02:24:40] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=HKmun0SRqv
[02:24:40] <Cork> ...
[02:24:40] <BigTymer37> did u get it
[02:24:40] <Cork> no
[02:24:44] <Cork> you need to save the fiddle
[02:25:42] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=HKmun0SRqv
[02:25:43] <BigTymer37> i did
[02:25:47] <BigTymer37> how come you are not joinging
[02:25:56] <Woet> because we don't want to join your session
[02:25:59] <Woet> we just want to see the code
[02:26:06] <Woet> https://jsfiddle.net/c5sp4fd7/1/
[02:26:07] <Woet> like that
[02:27:13] <lets_learn> Hi, I am new and would like to contribute. Can you please help me to get started ?
[02:27:18] <Cork> BigTymer37: all "live synk" features tend to just lose the content of the paste for everyone except for the one writing it
[02:27:26] <Cork> BigTymer37: that is why they are useless for asking questions
[02:27:32] <Woet> lets_learn: contribute to what?
[02:27:40] <Woet> lets_learn: if you want to learn, see https://api.jquery.com
[02:27:54] <Cork> lets_learn: http://contribute.jquery.org/
[02:28:26] <BigTymer37> <script async src="//jsfiddle.net/c5sp4fd7/1/embed/js,html/"></script>
[02:28:33] <Cork> ...
[02:28:36] <Cork> >_<'
[02:28:56] <Woet> Cork: thats quite insulting
[02:29:27] <Cork> BigTymer37: in the jsfiddle page you have a save button at the top left, hit that and the page url of the fiddle should change
[02:29:43] <Cork> BigTymer37: THAT url is it we need not the one woet posted as an example
[02:30:04] <Cork> and no another &together= url isn't going to help
[02:30:07] <BigTymer37> ok its saved
[02:30:31] <Cork> then copy the url and paste it here
[02:31:42] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/wj7xcb5p/
[02:31:48] <Cork> yay progress :)
[02:32:02] <Cork> it is empty though...
[02:32:09] <BigTymer37> ok
[02:32:12] <BigTymer37> lets try from step 1
[02:32:17] <Cork> O_o'
[02:32:59] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/nkf04vac/
[02:34:21] <BigTymer37> https://jsfiddle.net/ev6xxk31/
[02:34:24] <BigTymer37> try that one
[02:34:48] <Woet> BigTymer37: okay, now check the console and you'll see an error.
[02:35:05] <Cork> BigTymer37: your html is really broken
[02:35:17] <Cork> you have a tags inside other a tags for example
[02:35:26] <Cork> (not allowed by html spec)
[02:35:28] <BigTymer37> anything?
[02:35:45] <Cork> ah last link fixed that
[02:36:53] <Cork> BigTymer37: you have hover on the #download a link and the flyout is in a sibling
[02:37:07] <Cork> you can't really handle that with hover in a sane manner
[02:37:07] <BigTymer37> should it be nested differently
[02:37:14] <BigTymer37> how should it be handled
[02:37:17] <BigTymer37> a clic
[02:37:25] <BigTymer37> i did a click but  couldnt get menu away
[02:37:30] <Cork> i would recommend adding mouseenter and mouseleave on the parent li element
[02:37:39] <Cork> then the dom nesting would handle the rest
[02:37:42] <BigTymer37> on each one
[02:38:44] <Cork> BigTymer37: https://jsfiddle.net/ev6xxk31/1/
[02:39:29] <BigTymer37> no it doesnt work
[02:39:33] <BigTymer37> let me see if i can try to tailor
[02:40:03] <Cork> (also as the needed css isn't included seeing if it works or not isn't easy)
[02:46:57] <BigTymer37> how would an on click work
[02:46:59] <BigTymer37> how do you click
[02:47:03] <BigTymer37> and then click away again
[02:47:44] <Cork> not sure what your asking
[02:47:55] <BigTymer37> so how can i click the button and show the menu
[02:48:02] <BigTymer37> that is what i  need to do
[02:48:15] <BigTymer37> but then click the button again and the menu goes away
[02:48:23] <Cork> could you add the needed see so the menu looks somewhat like it should?
[02:48:32] <Cork> uh...
[02:48:38] <Cork> *needed css so the menu*
[03:40:32] <PB_> Hi, I am new to open source and I dont't know from where to start. I know Javascript, CSS and HTML. I want to contribute in jquery. Can you please guide me ?
[03:40:59] <Cork> RB_: http://contribute.jquery.org/
[03:59:25] <anli> Should not $("*").prop("disabled", false); disable all inputs?
[03:59:47] <Cork> no it should disable disable :)
[04:00:07] <Cork> also use $('input') or $(':input') not $('*')
[04:00:23] <Cork> no point in calling disabled = false on all divs and spans in the page
[04:00:29] <anli> Well, it should disable all inputs as well :)
[04:00:46] <Cork> no it should toggle disable off
[04:00:55] <anli> toggle?
[04:01:06] <Cork> prop('disabled', true) disables
[04:01:09] <anli> yeah
[04:01:15] <Cork> false turns it off
[04:01:26] <anli> I am so mistaken, I know that very well, just writing false :)
[04:01:33] <anli> instead of true...
[04:01:54] <anli> thx for pointing out that I am an idiot ;)
[04:02:09] <Cork> heh, np :)
[04:02:12] <anli> :)
[04:03:49] <hellyeah> what is wrong with that $('.ok').data('clicked', true)
[04:04:06] <Cork> context, don't leave out the context
[04:04:19] <hellyeah> what
[04:04:40] <Cork> hellyeah: how do i fix the error?
[04:04:49] <Cork> why do i have errors?
[04:05:07] <Cork> when you ask a question, don't leave out the context; it makes the question pointless
[04:05:19] <hellyeah> okay
[04:19:06] <hellyeah> is there a way to avoid keyboard input for dialog?
[04:19:29] <Cork> what do you mean?
[04:34:09] <anli> hm, pasting code in stack overflow will automatically create code formatting...
[04:34:16] <anli> Is that new?
[06:27:12] <hellyeah> when you click delete button i want to see the vertical row how can i do that? https://jsfiddle.net/8n65pb4u/2/
[06:29:24] <localh0st> hellyeah: what do you want?
[06:30:22] <hellyeah> want to remove the content
[06:34:29] <hellyeah> i mean you see the number, date etc.
[06:34:33] <hellyeah> i wannt remove them
[06:34:43] <hellyeah> i dont know how to do that it is vertical table
[08:49:31] <hellyeah> when i click button i would like to remove vertical row how can i do that https://jsfiddle.net/8n65pb4u/4/
[09:04:18] <Cork> hellyeah: just do .closest('tr').remove()
[09:06:24] <hellyeah> that will remove line
[09:06:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:06:28] <hellyeah> lemme try
[09:08:51] <hellyeah> Cork,  you mean this https://jsfiddle.net/8n65pb4u/6/
[09:09:08] <Cork> have you tried it?
[09:10:10] <hellyeah> yes
[09:10:12] <hellyeah> it is there
[09:11:08] <Cork> i didn't ask if you've added it; have you tried it
[09:11:41] <hellyeah> yes
[09:11:50] <hellyeah> i tried it
[09:11:55] <hellyeah> it only remove delete button
[09:12:37] <Cork> ya, and why might that be?
[09:12:56] <hellyeah> i know the reason
[09:13:09] <hellyeah> are you mocking me right now :p
[09:13:21] <Cork> if you know the reason why are you asking -_-'
[09:14:00] <hellyeah> i am just searching a way to solve the issue
[09:14:06] <Cork> hellyeah: and no i'm not mocking you; i'm trying to get you to think yourself a little
[09:14:08] <hellyeah> i cannot add div inside table
[09:14:20] <Cork> hellyeah: your rows are tables not rows that is the problem
[09:14:22] <hellyeah> actually i wrapped my head about issue
[09:14:37] <hellyeah> Cork,  this is the design choice
[09:14:40] <hellyeah> people made
[09:14:56] <Cork> so modify the selector to work with what you use (though don't call it rows)
[09:14:57] <hellyeah> i mean i am just writin gmodule for a ready software
[09:15:24] <hellyeah> is there a way to have same table appearence with different markup style?
[12:21:49] <z1haze> Hi everyone, I am trying to figure out if this is possible: I have written a es6 class wrapper around jquery-ui dialog and now I want to tie into the beforeClose event that is fired by the library that you can return false from to prevent a dialog from closing.. not sure how i can even do that with my own wrapper though
[12:27:34] <taplar> The users tell your wrapper what elements it should initialize with the jquery ui library, yes?
[12:52:30] <Bear_> help nick
[13:27:10] <Bear_> hey guys, I'm having a problem with this bit of code.. https://pastebin.com/D9tJTCN0  webdev is complaining about $ not existing.. I don't under why ($) and why (jQuery) at the end.
[13:27:50] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and type $.fn.jquery
[13:27:53] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:28:25] <Bear_> in webdev or in actual console?
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> in your dev tools in your browser.
[13:30:39] <Bear_> if from scratchpad it says "TypeError: $.fn is undefined
[13:30:47] <robertmaxrees> what about jQuery.fn.jquery
[13:31:27] <Bear_> 1.12.4
[13:31:35] <robertmaxrees> okay/
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> but this code says $ is undefined?
[13:31:48] <Bear_> yes
[13:31:58] <Bear_> TypeError: $ is not a function
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> is this code loaded before you include jQuery?
[13:32:36] <Bear_> no, its last in the list
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> at the top of that IIFE, add console.log(jQuery);
[13:34:02] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:34:16] <Bear_> https://pastebin.com/ubJUTzGM here's the full file.
[13:34:22] <Bear_> iife?
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> (function($) {})(jQuery);
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> and ah
[13:36:21] <robertmaxrees> see that $(function () { you have at the bottom?
[13:36:34] <robertmaxrees> for the allVideos stuff?
[13:36:39] <Bear_> yes
[13:36:45] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:37:02] <Bear_> I don't understand, sorry, I clearly a noob
[13:37:30] <robertmaxrees> so for some reason noConflict is setup on this page - I'm guessing wordpress?
[13:37:37] <Bear_> joomla
[13:37:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah alright.
[13:37:50] <Bear_> i can turn noconflict off but afaik its something we should have on
[13:37:51] <robertmaxrees> so $ isn't jQuery here.
[13:37:56] <Bear_> right
[13:37:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah leave that al;one.
[13:38:07] <Bear_> we have to use jQuery in place of $ everywhere right?
[13:38:08] <robertmaxrees> so when you do $(function () {, $ still isn't jquery.
[13:38:09] <irssi_> lel
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:38:23] <robertmaxrees> remember that IIFE i mentioned before?
[13:38:24] <Bear_> oh duh!
[13:38:27] <Bear_> lol
[13:38:28] <robertmaxrees> (function($) {})(jQuery);
[13:38:29] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:38:32] <Bear_> I never told it to use jquery!
[13:38:34] <robertmaxrees> can just wrap your code in that.
[13:39:18] <Bear_> ok, so, whats the purpose of the (jQuery) at the end?
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> that passes jQuery in as $
[13:39:36] <Bear_> AH!
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> for more info./
[13:40:05] <Bear_> cool.. ty!
[13:40:07] <irssi_> just find what jquery is bound to
[13:40:19] <Bear_> getting ready to take a course @ udemy but not enough time YET
[13:40:30] <robertmaxrees> Bear_ you can also just move your code into one of the other iifes you've got.
[13:41:04] <Bear_> @rrobertmaxrees I've been wondering about that
[13:41:41] <robertmaxrees> what about it
[13:41:53] <Bear_> wether it could be combined
[13:42:13] <robertmaxrees> well, there are two uses for IIFEs in this case.
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> one is to make $ == jquery
[13:42:38] <robertmaxrees> the other is to make a one-time use scope.
[13:42:49] <robertmaxrees> so if you want to share that scope, go ahead.
[13:42:53] <robertmaxrees> if not, that's cool too.
[13:43:21] <Bear_> well, this allvideo thing is SUPPOSED to make the video resizes responsively without losing ratio
[13:43:37] <robertmaxrees> taht doesn't really have any bearing on what I just said :)
[13:43:46] <Bear_> :( sorry
[13:43:49] <Bear_> trying
[13:43:51] <robertmaxrees> nah it's cool lol
[13:43:59] <robertmaxrees> just something to think about ;)
[13:44:17] <Bear_> I bet if I told my friend Michael what you just said he'd gib smack me lol
[13:44:26] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that?
[13:44:43] <Bear_> cause he breathes this stuff like a baby eats candy
[13:44:55] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:45:12] <robertmaxrees> so hardly at all?
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:45:21] <Bear_> Michael Babker look him up sometime
[13:45:57] * taplar prepares to stalk Michael Babker
[13:46:03] <Bear_> he TRIED yesterday to explain url versioning to me yesterday
[13:46:40] <Bear_> lol taplar
[13:47:00] <Bear_> if it wasn't for him I seriously doubt Joomla would be as good as it is.
[13:48:26] <Bear_> so, if I'm understanding this right, $( goes with )(jQuery); ?
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:48:58] <Bear_> rats
[13:49:16] <robertmaxrees> (function($) {})(jQuery)
[13:49:23] <robertmaxrees> $() will still break.
[13:49:30] <robertmaxrees> because $ isn't what you think it is.
[13:51:53] <Bear_> Robert, clearly the function above the allvideo and the allvideo are written in 2 different styles.
[13:52:29] <Bear_> the $ inside the () acts like a var in php function($foo) right?
[13:52:39] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[13:52:56] <taplar> it's just a function argument
[13:53:02] <taplar> you could call it 'bob'
[13:53:40] <robertmaxrees> fwiw (function () {})(); is the exact same thing as (function($) {})(jQuery), with the exception that you're not passing jQuery into the function as $
[13:54:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, they're written pretty much the same way.
[13:54:15] <Bear_> what I'm trying to FIRMLY understand is why they are coded differently so that I can better understand how to combine them efficiently.
[13:54:37] <robertmaxrees> the one that doesn't pass in jQuery simply doesnm'
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't use jQeury.
[13:54:47] <irssi_> what
[13:54:52] <robertmaxrees> you could put it in that previous IIFE and there should be no effect.
[13:55:03] <irssi_> i thot we like jquery
[13:55:11] <robertmaxrees> irssi_ i'm just talking about his paste duder.
[13:55:28] <robertmaxrees> Bear_ i'm referring specifically to (function () {})();
[13:55:39] <Bear_> gotcha
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> the one with the useragent lookup.
[13:55:44] <irssi_> dood Bear_
[13:55:52] <irssi_> y r u not understanding
[13:56:03] <Bear_> me?
[13:56:07] <robertmaxrees> irssi_ he just doesn't have experience with it.
[13:56:07] <irssi_> get it together man
[13:56:09] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal.
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:56:17] <taplar> not helpful irssi_
[13:56:30] <taplar> not everyone learns the same stuff at the same time
[13:56:47] <Bear_> I could teach irssi how to poke & peek :P
[13:57:21] <taplar> no wonder you told us to stalk that guy
[13:57:32] <Bear_> lol
[13:57:35] <Bear_> <~~ dinosaur
[13:57:48] <robertmaxrees> a bear that is also a dinosaur.
[13:58:03] <Bear_> hehehehe
[13:58:32] <taplar> come on, get up, get on the floor.  everybody rock the dinosaur
[13:58:40] <Bear_> crocodile rock :P
[13:59:28] <Bear_> I'll go read up on functions and that article you shared.. ty guys
[13:59:35] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:00:09] <Bear_> as for irssi, I've probably forgotten more then you'll ever know.. you'll find out when you get to be my age.
[14:00:28] <Bear_> anyone needs a 8" floppy aligned i'm your man
[14:00:37] <taplar> giggidy
[14:02:22] <irssi_> poor bear
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:03:01] <irssi_> these older guys just dont get it
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:03:29] <irssi_> kids will always be smarter
[14:03:50] <robertmaxrees> alright alright - move on.
[14:03:54] <irssi_> the species would have never survived if it was any other way lol
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> not asking again duder.
[14:04:32] <irssi_> ok fine
[14:06:47] * taplar is doing the "boom boom, shakka lakka lakka boom!"
[14:07:42] <irssi_> why cant i talk
[14:07:53] <irssi_> look taplar is doing it
[14:08:03] <taplar> cause it's an awesome song
[14:09:51] <robertmaxrees> irssi_ you can talk, just can't speak ill of other people ;)
[14:10:02] <irssi_> i didnt
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:10:20] <robertmaxrees> if you have any questions, you're more than welcome to PM me :)
[14:38:14] <robertmaxrees> oof.
[14:38:41] <taplar> mmm?
[14:40:00] <robertmaxrees> got a random BSOD.
[14:40:10] <taplar> ouch
[14:40:25] <taplar> got stuff backed up jic?
[15:18:43] <Bear_> @robertmaxrees sorry to bother you again.
[15:19:04] <Bear_> I fixed the issue we talked about but now in console it says "function n"
[15:19:11] <Bear_> idky it should display anything at all
[15:19:32] <irssi_> hello mister
[15:19:38] <Bear_> hi irssi
[15:21:23] <Bear_> maybe he walked away for a bit :(
[15:26:25] <Bear_> @irssi do you have any experience with fitvids?
[15:29:23] <taplar> Bear_: do you have a paste of the logic your having an issue with now?
[15:30:17] <Bear_> taplar: yeah, one sec.  I don't know wether the allvideo method or fitvids is best.. I just want to make sure the video maintains proportions and resizes appropriately.
[15:31:04] <Bear_> @taplar https://pastebin.com/ak5fPGYy
[15:31:09] <Bear_> last function
[15:32:14] <taplar> you said something was printing out "function n" ?
[15:32:28] <Bear_> yeah, one sec, I might have found the reason.
[15:32:54] <Bear_> heheh found it, max had me put console log in and I forgot to remove it.
[15:33:06] * Bear_ top line of pastebin
[15:33:13] <taplar> k
[15:33:23] <Bear_> sorry to have bothered y'all
[15:33:40] <irssi_> gash man
[15:33:40] <taplar> np at all
[15:33:51] <Bear_> have nice afternoon all
[15:33:54] * Bear_ *poof*
[15:34:03] <irssi_> omg
[16:17:40] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:50:44] <poboy> wtf.  this guy has the exact same id on numerous buttons.  https://kopy.io/XfrU1
[16:51:33] <robertmaxrees> probably doesn't know.
[16:51:55] <irssi_> who cares
[16:52:05] <irssi_> buttons shmuttons
[16:52:16] <robertmaxrees> chill out duder
[16:52:17] <irssi_> no
[16:52:26] <irssi_> y cant we make jokes
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> other people aren't seeing them as jokes heh.
[16:52:55] <taplar> not every joke has to put someone else down
[16:52:57] <irssi_> wow
[16:54:01] <irssi_> take ur admin clothes off robertmaxrees
[16:54:10] * robertmaxrees sighs
[16:55:21] <poboy> lol
[16:58:23] <irssi_> i need my own office
[16:58:37] <irssi_> since u guys cant understand me
[16:59:20] <taplar> it's #jquery, not #understandingirssi
[16:59:59] <WillPittenger> Does JQuery have a way to detect an image failed to load and attempt to reload it?
[17:00:36] <taplar> i'm not aware of an event that is thrown on image failure
[17:00:52] <taplar> though you might could execute a quick head request to see if you get a 200 back
[17:01:31] <WillPittenger> Even if the image is inside a page?  My script is running through GreaseMonkey.
[17:01:43] <taplar> sure
[17:01:58] <taplar> so long as you know the url, you can make an ajax request to it
[17:02:19] <robertmaxrees> WillPittenger what sort of browser support do you need?
[17:02:32] <WillPittenger> Pale Moon is what I use.
[17:02:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:03:09] <robertmaxrees> is this for a personal project or do you plan on the general public to be able to use it?
[17:03:17] <WillPittenger> Just for me.
[17:03:39] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if it supports service works.
[17:03:43] <robertmaxrees> *workers
[17:04:13] <WillPittenger> It's based on the final version of Gecko.
[17:05:25] <WillPittenger> Basically, the author of PM doesn't like the directions that Mozilla going.
[17:15:36] <robertmaxrees> they may not support it then.
[17:15:38] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[17:15:53] <robertmaxrees> taplar's advice is probably the best bet.
[17:16:39] <grapheti> Do your classnames need to be different in order to make these buttons disabled? - https://jsfiddle.net/9r627xg8/3/
[17:16:47] <grapheti> gah, I feelin' so dumb
[17:17:20] <grapheti> I just want to click that red box and have all three buttons toggle disable/enable
[17:17:39] <robertmaxrees> grapheti you're doing this via plain ol' JS.
[17:17:41] <taplar> I doubt the .disabled does an implicit each
[17:17:48] <robertmaxrees> var toggle = document.querySelector(".btnToggle"); only gets the first one.
[17:18:35] <grapheti> ye, tryin' document.querySelector(".btnToggle")[1] but prolly don't work like that
[17:18:51] <grapheti> anyway, I know it's off-topic
[17:18:59] <grapheti> I'll figure it out lol
[17:18:59] <robertmaxrees> you'd need querySelectorAll to get all of them using raw js.
[17:19:14] <grapheti> yeah, they don't have disabled method tho
[17:19:16] <robertmaxrees> and then manually enumerate
[17:19:21] <grapheti> ahhh
[17:24:32] <gambl0re> hello?
[17:24:38] <taplar> bonjour
[17:24:50] <gambl0re> i want to clear all the input fields once the form is closed
[17:24:53] <gambl0re> how would i do that
[17:25:18] <gambl0re> the form has input text, radio, select, checkbox, email
[17:25:46] <taplar> well, since you have radio and select in there, its not really a one step thing
[17:26:05] <taplar> you can select the non-radio non-select and set the val('')
[17:26:20] <taplar> sorry, not select, checkbox
[17:26:31] <taplar> radio and checkbox, you'd select them and set prop('checked', false)
[17:26:55] <gambl0re> i have to target each one individually?
[17:26:55] <z1haze> can you create delegated event listeners from document?
[17:27:16] <z1haze> wondering if that's the cause of a problem im having, where totally is ignoring my js
[17:27:18] <taplar> gambl0re: there is the ':input' pseudoselector that jquery has that should get them all
[17:27:49] <taplar> and then you can optionally filter on '[type=checkbox],[type=radio]'
[17:28:08] <taplar> z1haze: yeah you can put a delegate on document
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/reset
[17:28:16] <robertmaxrees> there's also this.
[17:28:19] <z1haze> ok
[17:28:28] <robertmaxrees> which might help.
[17:28:32] <taplar> true
[17:29:06] <taplar> z1haze: what event are you delegate binding for?
[17:29:54] <grapheti> stupid DOM tree elements @#$%@#$@$# - https://jsfiddle.net/9r627xg8/4/
[17:30:15] <z1haze> a click event
[17:30:21] <z1haze> on some async loaded content
[17:30:33] <taplar> k
[17:30:40] <z1haze> its just totally ignoring it
[17:31:00] <taplar> are there any other click handlers on the element?
[17:31:16] <z1haze> maybe
[17:31:23] <taplar> because if there are and any of the stop the propagation of the event, your delegate will not happen
[17:31:28] <z1haze> right
[17:31:34] <z1haze> but its not preventing default at all
[17:31:44] <z1haze> so wouldnt that mean its not being handled
[17:31:50] <taplar> prevent default != stop propagation
[17:31:59] <z1haze> yeah im 100% sure we're not stopping proppagation anywhere
[17:33:23] <gambl0re> taplar, thanks
[17:38:36] <irssi_> how do i fire promises when socket io event happents
[17:38:52] <taplar> 'fire'?
[17:39:06] <irssi_> promize.resolve()
[17:39:32] <taplar> you can reject/resolve a promise at that time, sure.  but you can only do it once per promise
[17:39:36] <irssi_> but it will only fire once
[17:39:51] <irssi_> should i make new promises everytime?
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> and you do it from within the promise.
[17:39:57] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:40:09] <irssi_> thats kinda stupid huh
[17:40:16] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[17:40:20] <robertmaxrees> that's part of why they're awesome.
[17:40:40] <irssi_> socket.on{ promise.resolve()
[17:40:47] <robertmaxrees> that's not an event.
[17:40:51] <taplar> afaik, socket io already has promise like logic related to it's receiving massages.  i'm not sure why you're creating extra ones
[17:41:10] <irssi_> orly
[17:41:13] <gambl0re> taplar, it isnt working
[17:41:44] <taplar> gambl0re: share what you got?
[17:43:11] <gambl0re> im doing $('#gender').find('option').prop('checked', false)
[17:43:31] <taplar> you don't uncheck selects
[17:43:36] <taplar> just set their val('')
[17:43:52] <gambl0re> im doing $('#gender').val() ?
[17:44:00] <taplar> which is the getter
[17:44:00] <gambl0re> gender is radio buttons
[17:44:15] <taplar> ok, so why are you trying to find('option')?
[17:44:18] <gambl0re> male, female etc..
[17:44:37] <taplar> i mean you can't repeat that id on all the fields anyway, so that's hokey
[17:44:43] <gambl0re> isnt it like that?
[17:44:58] <taplar> what's the name of the radio?
[17:45:03] <taplar> *radios
[17:45:22] <irssi_> can som1 show me example
[17:45:27] <gambl0re> id is #male, female
[17:45:34] <taplar> what's the name?
[17:45:55] <irssi_> socket io mesage handler promize
[17:46:21] <taplar> irssi_: you're listening for messages with something like socket.on('thing', function) no?
[17:46:28] <gambl0re> male and female
[17:46:38] <taplar> gambl0re: the name is different?
[17:46:59] <gambl0re> those are the names
[17:47:10] <irssi_> yes
[17:47:24] <taplar> then i'm confused.  radio buttons that function as an "or" have to have the same name to enforce the exclusion
[17:47:36] <preilly> what's the best way to check a value once someone is done entering it? e.g., .keyup(function() {... fires on each keystroke
[17:47:57] <taplar> irssi_: that construct behaves just like an event handler.  related in that it is asynchronous.  you can perform whatever you want inside
[17:48:08] <irssi_> i am
[17:48:40] <taplar> so why do you need a promise?
[17:48:47] <irssi_> but i need to reload data inside
[17:48:52] <gambl0re> taplar, any ideas
[17:48:54] <irssi_> but i dont have a ref to it
[17:48:54] <gambl0re> ?
[17:49:10] <taplar> gambl0re: did you see my question about why the names are different for the radio buttons?
[17:49:39] <taplar> irssi_: why can't you initiate the data reload inside the message receival?
[17:50:05] <irssi_> because its in its own module
[17:50:38] <taplar> so the message receival doesn't know how/have access to start the reload?
[17:50:44] <irssi_> i have consructed a prety elaborate web
[17:50:53] <irssi_> yes
[17:51:11] <taplar> then personally i'd recommend one of a couple things
[17:51:18] <taplar> the first being preferred.
[17:51:35] <taplar> make it so that the message receival can do that
[17:51:51] <taplar> cause that just makes sense from the asynchronous perspective
[17:52:18] <taplar> otherwise, another option would be to have the message receival logic trigger a custom event on some element on the page
[17:52:25] <taplar> that your other logic would listen to
[17:52:36] <taplar> that is less preferred because you are funneling logic through the dom
[17:52:39] <taplar> but can work
[17:53:01] <irssi_> im using events now
[17:53:29] <irssi_> but i wanted to just solve this with a .then
[17:53:52] <taplar> this doesn't really fit a promise situation, because you are not returning for every message
[17:53:56] <taplar> it's asynchronous already
[17:54:10] <irssi_> yeah
[17:54:19] <irssi_> perhaps i can just pass the function ref
[17:54:37] <taplar> that does the reload?
[17:54:47] <irssi_> its becaose my messaging is in a service
[17:54:59] <irssi_> and my data is in the controller
[17:55:25] <taplar> if you can pass in the function that should be executed when a message is received, that's a win.  callbacks are awesome, :)
[17:55:28] <irssi_> i need to pass controller.find() to service
[17:56:01] <irssi_> service.on.recieve { controller.find() }
[17:56:10] <irssi_> thats what i need
[17:56:54] <irssi_> but rightnow im just doing $broadcast('reload-data')
[17:57:23] <taplar> from the server or client?
[17:57:45] <irssi_> ?
[17:58:00] <taplar> are you broadcasting that from the backend or frontend?
[17:58:08] <taplar> i'm assuming backend
[17:58:08] <irssi_> client
[17:58:37] <taplar> so your frontend is broadcasting a message for the frontend?
[17:59:29] <irssi_> ya
[17:59:49] <taplar> is this so the different pieces are decoupled?
[17:59:57] <irssi_> yes
[18:00:03] <irssi_> angular events
[18:00:56] <taplar> ok, so one piece is sendind out a 'reload-data' message and another part is listening for that message and needs to execute the method to rebuild.
[18:01:19] <irssi_> ya that part is already done
[18:01:44] <taplar> k
[18:08:22] <irssi_> isnt it more efficient to not use events
[18:08:51] <taplar> compared to calling logic directly, events are less efficient
[18:17:24] <irssi_> genius
[20:53:31] <irssi_> who is aria?
[20:53:45] <irssi_> i keep seeing her name in the html
