[11:46:16] <snake-venom>  hi i have anchor which i want copy to clipboard ; https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334183/
[11:46:17] <snake-venom> <snake-venom> but seems anchor not working with select()
[11:50:25] <ryan_ford> "When an HTML document has been switched to designMode, its document object exposes an execCommand method to run commands that manipulate the current editable region, such as form inputs or contentEditable elements."
[11:50:31] <ryan_ford> https://devdocs.io/dom/document/execcommand
[11:50:55] <ryan_ford> looks like execCommand is not exposed by default
[11:54:57] <snake-venom> ryan_ford, it will not work means .. right... i need to remove contenteditable ?
[11:56:17] <snake-venom> oh but i dont have contenteditable..
[11:58:16] <ryan_ford> you need to set designMode to true, and you should preventDefault on your event listener to keep the page from reloading
[11:58:32] <ryan_ford> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334323/
[11:59:06] <ryan_ford> assuming you've highlighted a selection, it appears to work
[12:02:24] <ryan_ford> ohh you're tring to get the select to work, not the copy ðŸ™ˆ
[12:02:49] <snake-venom> both select and copy
[12:05:49] <snake-venom> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334345/ ryan_ford  it seems not working
[12:17:43] <ryan_ford> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334362/
[12:18:33] <ryan_ford> so you need contenteditable, you're correct, but you also need to give the element focus first as well, and the command to highlight is also exposed by designMode as document.execCommand('selectAll')
[12:19:25] <ryan_ford> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334365/
[12:23:32] <ryan_ford> you could probably set contenteditable and remove it in your function as well
[12:25:13] <snake-venom>  document.execCommand('selectAll') this helped me .. :) thanks man
[12:25:27] <snake-venom> and also focus()
[12:29:25] <ryan_ford> no prob, my first time messing with it, so a learning experience for me too
[12:31:19] <snake-venom> i also want to learn it in deep.. and dont know when i can i am expert iin this :) ;)
[12:55:15] <snake-venom> ryan_ford,
[12:55:44] <snake-venom> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334365/ it seems our approach selecting whole document.. not the specfic anchor tag
[12:57:00] <ryan_ford> https://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/334365/
[12:57:31] <ryan_ford> move contenteditable to the anchor
[12:58:00] <ryan_ford> since that's what you're giving focus to, it should only highlight the link
[13:00:03] <snake-venom> "The execCommand method works differently in different browsers, the commands are only executable for editable elements in Firefox,  " i was also reading this when you gave the ans :0
