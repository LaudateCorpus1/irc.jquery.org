[00:00:59] <tw2113> regex isn't the easiest thing ever
[00:01:20] <tw2113> i'd be surprised if you got it right off the bat
[00:01:43] <ryanseddon> yeah they just kinda make sense one day
[00:01:58] <ryanseddon> hi tw2113 i missed you hello
[00:02:09] <tw2113> ;) no worries, it's an active room
[00:02:36] <ryanseddon> rather i Missed "your" not missed you ;)
[00:02:48] <tw2113> :O you missed me
[00:02:55] <tw2113> aim better :P
[00:03:31] <Back2Basics> lerner there are websites devoted to generating these things.
[00:03:53] <tw2113> there are websites dedicated to everything
[00:18:16] <andr0id1> good morning everyone :D
[00:20:59] <andr0id1> i have a question: in a form, i am using jquery validator, i have two submit buttons. when i click on the first one, it takes me on another form and i do some stuff there.the submit(second one), in my script, gets skipped. any ideas why?
[00:23:18] <vlad27aug> could you make a fiddle?
[00:23:23] <Back2Basics> don't knowâ€¦ does it look like this? http://bpaste.net/show/6b1kGYwKR0f6hjOzcylk/
[00:23:52] <andr0id1> yes it does
[00:24:02] <andr0id1> lett me paste the code
[00:24:27] <parco> andr0id1, you use android?
[00:24:35] <andr0id1> yes
[00:24:49] <andr0id1> as a computer os, i use win
[00:24:52] <Back2Basics> well I wouldn't suggest doing it this way because it posts but not with JSON.
[00:25:05] <parco> andr0id1, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.demarco.jarvis
[00:25:11] <parco> stay safe out there ;)
[00:25:35] <andr0id1> the script is huge, let me explain it here better
[00:26:01] <andr0id1> i have the script in this order:
[00:26:37] <andr0id1> jquery validator, form, fields, submit field1 that takes me to do something else, two more fields, and the second submit button
[00:27:32] <andr0id1> in the script that does db entries, i first verify : if isset($_POST['submit']) first, but that one gets skipped
[00:27:40] <andr0id1> and i get empty page
[00:28:12] <andr0id1> why?
[00:30:15] <andr0id1> anyone any ideas?
[00:33:08] <andr0id1> please help?
[00:36:47] <Back2Basics> if you get an empty page that doesn't sound like it's the post value at all it sounds like the handler on the server side.
[00:37:42] <andr0id1> before i started using the jquery validator, i had two buttons only using php, and it worked fine, but now, only one of them works
[00:37:44] <Back2Basics> what is the handler using?
[00:38:12] <andr0id1> 	submitHandler: function() { formReference.submit(); }
[00:38:24] <Back2Basics> ok I don't know php.  is there some kind of echo function that gives you just post results back/
[00:38:25] <Back2Basics> ?
[00:38:54] <andr0id1> yes, but the whole veriffication of the submit button gets skipped
[00:39:24] <Back2Basics> I'm having the same issue  ( I think.  I can't figure out how to do a line by line debug)
[00:40:28] <andr0id1> the first submit button is :<input type="submit" name="add" value="Add"> and the second one is <input type"submit" name="submit: value="submit">
[00:44:19] <Back2Basics> does the validate work for both buttons?
[00:44:27] <andr0id1> not for the seccond one
[00:44:34] <andr0id1> only for the first one
[00:44:40] <Back2Basics> is the validate supposed to work for both?
[00:44:50] <andr0id1> yes
[00:45:06] <Back2Basics> can you post the function?
[00:45:10] <Back2Basics> and the form
[00:45:55] <andr0id1> the form is too big
[00:46:20] <slayerx_x> andr0id1 you shoud have2 forms
[00:46:46] <slayerx_x> separate
[00:47:16] <slayerx_x> ?
[00:47:18] <Back2Basics> how about the validate function?
[00:47:46] <slayerx_x> second set of validation
[00:47:49] <Back2Basics> we can take guesses all night.
[00:48:01] <slayerx_x> yup
[00:48:22] <andr0id1> do you want me to paste the whole form?
[00:48:26] <slayerx_x> all day in my case
[00:48:27] <andr0id1> in a pastebin?
[00:49:24] <Back2Basics> SHOW ME THE CODE!
[00:50:01] <andr0id1> http://pastebin.com/HKpLeDbc
[00:50:45] <Mohsen_Hassani> What's the jquery print command?
[00:51:41] <tga> hello
[00:52:06] <tga> deferreds question: I am making ajax() calls in a loop, how can I resolve a promise only after they all complete?
[00:52:13] <f0rkn1ght> Mohsen_Hassani, .text() ?
[00:52:40] <tga> oh, wait, when() should work
[00:52:58] <Back2Basics> tga: a callback?
[00:54:17] <Back2Basics> andr0id1: you have 2 forms with the same id.
[00:54:48] <andr0id1> yes, one is if i get something from a temp table, if i dont, it goes to the empty one
[00:55:41] <Back2Basics> an id field is a unique identifier
[00:56:02] <andr0id1> yes
[00:56:44] <Back2Basics> $("#signupForm") might only reference the first instance (since it's supposed to be UNIQUE)
[00:56:52] <Back2Basics> I'm guessing.
[00:57:27] <andr0id1> here is what i do: i have two submit buttons, if you click the first one, put all the data in a temp table, go to the other site, enter something, submit there, go back, get the id, and fill out the form with the previous values
[00:57:33] <Back2Basics> make signupForm a class and use $(".signupForm")
[00:58:42] <Back2Basics> or just cmxform
[00:59:23] <andr0id1> let me try
[01:05:48] <andr0id1> Back2Basics, fixed it another way :D
[01:06:15] <andr0id1> i just had to add: class='submit' to the first button
[01:06:16] <Back2Basics> what changed?
[01:06:27] <andr0id1> i just had to add: class='submit' to the first button
[01:07:07] <andr0id1> different classes, i suppose if the first button doesnt have class, the validator assumes that the second one doesnt have one either
[01:07:10] <slayerx_x> man you got a lot of cleanup to do :)
[01:07:29] <Back2Basics> I'm glad it worked for you
[01:08:01] <andr0id1> yeap :D there is supose to be a knowledge base of some kind...that we can share the experience
[01:08:12] <andr0id1> eg .resolved problem
[01:10:08] <Back2Basics> andr0id1: What's the diff between putting your "messages" into javascript and having the browser do the work rather than the server side script finish it off?
[01:17:59] <andr0id1> Back2Basics: i dont need messages, i need db entries thats all
[01:18:43] <Back2Basics> then what's this :   messages: {
[01:18:44] <Back2Basics>                         denumire: "Introduceti denumire produs",
[01:18:59] <andr0id1> those are the error messages that if the field is empty
[01:19:04] <Back2Basics> etc.. etc.. etc...
[01:19:26] <andr0id1> if i dont get any of those messages, the form submits
[01:19:35] <Back2Basics> these are the translations which you call "messages"
[01:20:06] <andr0id1> if you see there, denumire: "required",
[01:20:29] <andr0id1> if it was "optional", it wont give me an error
[01:20:52] <andr0id1> thus no need for it to put it in: messages: {
[01:24:42] <tga> unless I'm reading this  wrong, I have a .when() resolving _before_ its deferreds are all done
[01:27:15] <nVee> hey guys, does anyone know how to reset a jquery sortable element?
[01:27:32] * tga doesn't
[01:27:34] <nVee> I need to reset the entire sortable container to a blank state when a user clicks on a button
[01:30:35] <andr0id1> another question: in another form, i have 7 fields. bellow them i have a checkbox, and another 7 fields. how to do if i check the checkbox, the values from the upper 7 fields to be coppied in the lower 7 fields?
[01:30:36] <tga> $.each() is async, right?
[01:34:00] <andr0id1> anyone?
[01:35:08] <parco> andr0id1, just gonna take some code
[01:35:32] <parco> create an onclick handler and Handle it
[01:40:39] <chrislabeard> I have an animation on some divs on page load how can I stagger the animation so it loads them 1 by 1?
[01:43:26] <tga> alright, this is definitely weird
[01:44:27] <tga> $.when([ 20 deferreds, all pending ]).done(function() { <check deferreds, all 20 are still pending> })
[01:44:31] <tga> how could that be?
[01:54:28] <Nece228> http://paste.opensuse.org/55908873
[01:54:41] <Nece228> im basically checking if the form fields arent empty
[01:55:08] <Nece228> but no matter if i type something or not it still gives me error that fields are empty
[01:55:12] <krz> anyone used http://jqvmap.com/ before?
[02:01:50] <tga> deferreds question: why does when() resolve when all its parameters are still pending?
[02:01:52] <tga> http://jsfiddle.net/8KQSu/
[02:15:49] <krz> anyone used http://jqvmap.com/ before?
[02:17:12] <MoTiOnXml> krz: looks awesome!
[02:17:33] <krz> I'm wondering if there is a way to add dots on a country
[02:17:39] <krz> dots/markers/or whatever
[02:18:38] <MoTiOnXml> it's vector, so yes
[02:19:24] <krz> how so?
[02:19:36] <krz> I'm trying to dynamically add dots
[02:19:39] <Back2Basics> tga: do you know how to do a line by line debug of your code?  (I don't)
[02:19:52] <krz> to represent how many people are in a site
[02:21:41] <MoTiOnXml> krz: just use the API to draw on top of the countries
[02:21:43] <Back2Basics> krz: random dispersion in a geographical boundary?
[02:22:48] <krz> MoTiOnXml: which method? https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap
[02:26:17] <MoTiOnXml> krz: i suggest you spend a little more time figuring it out
[02:26:23] <MoTiOnXml> krz: you're a programmer, right?
[02:26:51] <krz> MoTiOnXml: I've looked at it. cannot see any indication in the api
[02:26:56] <MoTiOnXml> what do you want?
[02:27:05] <MoTiOnXml> you want to draw some circles with numbers in?
[02:27:06] <krz> what you suggested
[02:27:16] <krz> no just some cirlces
[02:27:20] <terryleigh> I don't know what I'm doing wrong.. but I'm trying to get the value of a textarea using: $("input#contact_comments").val() but I keep getting undefined.
[02:27:22] <MoTiOnXml> the lines are just connected coordinates
[02:27:28] <terryleigh> without .val() I get some object.
[02:27:50] <krz> MoTiOnXml: what lines are you referring to?
[02:28:24] <terryleigh> nevermind... *rolls eyes*
[02:28:32] <krz> MoTiOnXml: what made you indicate that you can use the api to drop on top of the countries?
[02:33:36] <MoTiOnXml> krz: since you can draw e.g countries using arbitrary vector coordinates, i assume you also can draw on top of said countries
[02:33:43] <MoTiOnXml> krz: call it a hunch
[02:35:30] <shwaiil> hi
[02:37:51] <shwaiil> Q: I have 4 columns, that display 80% of a nested image. When you mouseover each column, it should expand, revealing the rest of the image. I'm wondering what's the best way of doing this ? I'm right now setting a jsfiddle to show a good example
[02:37:54] <shwaiil> Thanks for looking
[02:39:40] <Chibby_> Could anyone please help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/Chib/y72YG/ I'm tring to get the text from the divs into an array of strings, at the moment it joins them together into I guess just a single string?
[02:41:56] <Dr-Bombay> where does it join them into a single string?
[02:42:52] <Dr-Bombay> I see 9 separate p elements
[02:43:48] <Chibby_> well I'm looping through thx variable x by index and printing them into p elements
[02:44:15] <ravenzz> ?map @ Chibby_
[02:44:15] <caniuse> Chibby_: .map(): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[02:44:15] <Chibby_> i would've thought there'd be only 2 values in x
[02:44:45] <Dr-Bombay> it's doing exactly what the documentation for text() says. caniuse has the right idea
[02:45:08] <Dr-Bombay> $('div').map(function() { return $(this).text(); });
[02:45:21] <ravenzz> caniuse would fool you sometimes, he is a bad guy
[02:46:38] <Dr-Bombay> not as bad as me
[02:46:40] <shwaiil> Q: UPDATED > I have 4 columns, that display 80% of a nested image. When you mouseover each column, it should expand, revealing the rest of the image. I'm wondering what's the best way of doing this ? (JSFIDDLE: http://jsfiddle.net/heldrida/urvwy/ )
[02:47:04] <ravenzz> shwaiil CSS?
[02:47:08] <shwaiil> I'm thinking about detaching the element, and then z-index above the other elements and expand
[02:47:18] <shwaiil> ravenzz: hi, css ? what do you mean ?
[02:47:58] <ravenzz> do that in css? :p
[02:48:19] <ravenzz> + css3 transitions for the cool browsers
[02:48:46] <shwaiil> ravenzz: could you check my example ?  I need to have this working for legacy browsers..so I'd rather stick with JS
[02:49:15] <ravenzz> IE<10 won't see the animation, but on hover they will still see the image in full size
[02:49:48] <ravenzz> you can polyfill it in js if you really care of the old ie versions
[02:50:31] <shwaiil> ravenzz: I understand the css point, but I need to expand to right | >>, and make the sibbiling elements go underneath the previous one
[02:50:43] <ravenzz> np?
[02:50:45] <Chibby_> ravenzz: thanks, got what I needed with that!
[02:50:46] <shwaiil> but anyway, I'll try just with css just to see what happens
[02:50:52] <ravenzz> position absolute?
[02:51:24] <ravenzz> Chibby_ you're welcome
[02:51:42] <shwaiil> yeah I'll try =)
[02:52:02] <shwaiil> maybe you're seeing something that I'm not right now, I'm just thinkg about js
[02:53:14] <Nz17> Hello, simple question: I'm trying to make a statement like '$(this > "ol").slideToggle("slow");' but I can't figure out the syntax.  How can I say, "slideToggle any ol elements contained in this."?
[02:53:23] <ravenzz> imho the best approach is get rid of js as much as possible
[02:56:45] <Dr-Bombay> nz17: $(this).find('ol')
[02:56:47] <walidvb> hi guys, how can I use a function declared in a script within another script? (say I have scripts.js for the whole site, and a page has a specific spec.js file, i want to use a fct from scripts.js in spec.js)
[02:57:02] <Nz17> Thank you, Dr. Bombay.
[02:57:03] <Dr-Bombay> wait not find
[02:57:04] <Dr-Bombay> child
[02:57:10] <Nz17> Thanks again. :-)
[02:57:21] <walidvb> i do load scripts.js BEFORE spec.js in my header
[02:58:54] <ravenzz> shwaiil this is the basic idea http://jsfiddle.net/E2sgL/
[02:59:09] <ravenzz> you need to add the transitions
[02:59:47] <Dr-Bombay> walid: if a script attaches an object to the window object, it will be visible to scripts loaded later on. jquery itself does this. A script usually does not need to attach more than one object to the window
[03:00:20] <ravenzz> shwaiil like this http://jsfiddle.net/E2sgL/1/
[03:00:53] <Nz17> Dr. Bombay: Just discovered that it is _not_ child, but children.  Otherwise, it works flawlessly. :-D
[03:01:06] <shwaiil> ravenzz: interesting
[03:01:11] <walidvb> Dr-Bombay: could you elaborate?
[03:01:23] <DaveJ|UK> When I create an accordion, it seems to be missing some of its styles. Font, background and border are applied, but it doesn't have any padding and the icons are missing. If I specify the icons manually it has no effect. Any suggestions?
[03:01:45] <DaveJ|UK> i tried changing the theme tooo
[03:02:18] <ravenzz> shwaiil oh sorry there is a z-index issue http://jsfiddle.net/E2sgL/2/
[03:02:51] <ravenzz> the 1st one has the higher value
[03:03:23] <shwaiil> really good ravenzz I'm studying your example and then I'll apply what I've learned in mine
[03:03:34] <shwaiil> for older browsers what should I do then ?
[03:04:47] <ravenzz> you can use Modernizr that will let you the ability to detect if the browser supports or not css transitions
[03:07:10] <Jax> hello
[03:07:14] <sonja> am i using $.post correctly? http://pastie.org/3924765
[03:07:23] <sonja> hi jax
[03:08:29] <Jax> i just started using twitter's bootstrap stuff yesterday. Is there a way to get tables to collapse, or maybe a more elegant way to do this? Say i have a table of orders, and a client needs to open the order to see the details but doesn't want to change page because he/she might want to compare the contents of the orders or perform operations on the contents directly
[03:09:10] <Jax> so say you have 3 orders in a table, and when you click one, the items should open below the order (and ideally, the items are collapsable as well)
[03:09:19] <ravenzz> sonja $.post('edit_user.php', { action: 'edit', id : $(this).attr('id') });
[03:09:32] <shwaiil> ravenzz: I'm really impressed with your example
[03:09:42] <sonja> thanks raven, i'll try that
[03:11:43] <ravenzz> Jax ok what is the question? :p
[03:11:56] <Jax> i'm looking for a way to do this
[03:12:12] <Jax> 1) should i be using <table> 2) what js lib should i use if one exists?
[03:12:12] <ravenzz> are you going to get the details in ajax right?
[03:12:21] <Jax> would be very nice, but could also be loaded all in one shot
[03:12:23] <sonja> ravenzz: clicking on it should load up the new page, right?
[03:13:10] <ravenzz> it should post those data to edit_user.php
[03:14:01] <sonja> for some reason it just reloads the current page i'm on
[03:14:09] <sonja> e.g. the url bar doesn't change to edit_user.php
[03:14:11] <sonja> http://pastie.org/3924783
[03:14:11] <ravenzz> is .edit a link?
[03:14:31] <sonja>   <a href="" class="edit"   id="d<?php echo $u['user_id']; ?>">edit</a>
[03:14:33] <sonja> yes
[03:14:53] <ravenzz> ?preventDefault @ sonja
[03:15:30] <ravenzz> yo
[03:15:35] <ravenzz> sonja  http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:15:41] <sonja> thanks! o wise one
[03:18:12] <sonja> ravenzz:  like this? http://pastie.org/3924796
[03:19:01] <Sieben> Hello everybody
[03:19:12] <T1N647> Hello Sieben.
[03:19:37] <Sieben> I'm working on a webpage located there http://cerebro.sieben.fr
[03:19:45] <Sieben> I want to check the state of a button
[03:19:54] <Sieben> I use this jquery command :
[03:19:54] <Sieben> $("#global_lab").attr('checked')
[03:20:05] <Sieben> But I get an undefined every time
[03:20:17] <T1N647> I'll just take a look.
[03:20:19] <Sieben> Even when I clicked on a good button
[03:20:26] <Sieben> thank you T1N647 :)
[03:20:39] <T1N647> you're more than welcome.
[03:20:40] <Sieben> I'm a js/jquery beginner
[03:21:47] <ravenzz> Jax what do you think about using nested tables?
[03:22:33] <ravenzz> sonja yes
[03:22:33] <T1N647> @Sieben you could use the ".one()" event to fire a function on the first click.
[03:22:49] <ravenzz> sonja you don't need to slice
[03:22:49] <Jax> ravenzz: if that leads to an acceptable solution i'm open
[03:22:55] <T1N647> It depends what you're trying to acheieve. "Checked" will operate on a checkbox.
[03:23:00] <iLogic> Sieben: don't you mean val() instead of attr()?
[03:23:10] <sonja> i want to remove the first character
[03:23:43] <sonja> the css id is "d443" but the string i want to pass is "443"
[03:23:53] <Sieben> iLogic, yes precisely
[03:23:56] <lijzz> hi
[03:24:41] <Sieben> T1N647, I would rather don't get involved with function on this scope
[03:25:01] <lijzz> one of my animate popup is not working in ie8
[03:25:06] <Sieben> Is it possible to use only a simple command rather than event+function
[03:25:47] <ravenzz> Jax like this http://jsfiddle.net/J8wzT/
[03:25:56] <ravenzz> sonja ok
[03:25:58] <T1N647> Certainly within the "$("#global_lab").one()" call
[03:26:31] <T1N647> $("#global_lab").one("clicked", COMMAND HERE);
[03:26:32] <ravenzz> Jax but use tables only if you have tabular data to display
[03:26:38] <ravenzz> not for layouts
[03:26:41] <lijzz> ravenzz cus u please check the website http://test2.stocktrends.net/main.php# in ie8
[03:26:56] <Jax> well orders are tabular i guess: order_id, customer, order_date, price
[03:27:04] <Jax> and the items: item_nr, amount, price, etc
[03:27:05] <ravenzz> yep
[03:27:07] <lijzz> one popup is not working in ie8
[03:27:08] <Jax> that is tabular, isn't it
[03:27:09] <iLogic> sonja: var id = d443; var numberid = id.substring(1);
[03:27:23] <ravenzz> Jax of course they are ;)
[03:27:24] <lijzz> ravenzz, in chrome the animate popup is working
[03:27:24] <sonja> or slice(1)
[03:27:37] <Jax> ravenzz: i guess this would work for unlimited depths?
[03:27:40] <lijzz> ravenzz, but in ie8 it is not
[03:28:06] <iLogic> sonja: i believe slice is for arrays
[03:28:18] <Jax> thanks for that ravenzz
[03:28:20] <ravenzz> Jax yes, it could be a bit painful when you see the huge markup, but it should work
[03:28:24] <sonja> is there a way to refresh the php page? $.post is correctly posting the info (deleting the user), but the page doesn't reload
[03:28:39] <ravenzz> the current page?
[03:28:44] <lijzz> yaa
[03:29:07] <lijzz> but @ bottom
[03:29:10] <ravenzz> lijzz where the popups are?
[03:29:16] <lijzz> @ bottom
[03:29:20] <iLogic> sonja: you can echo a meta tag
[03:29:22] <sonja> i.e. the post is correctly sending the data to users.php to delete the user, which is being done. but i want users.php to also reload , so i can visually see the user gone
[03:29:29] <ravenzz> stock trends and whatever?
[03:29:35] <lijzz> if you open the same in chrome u can see the pop up opening after some 5 seconds
[03:29:39] <iLogic> with url=page.html
[03:29:47] <sonja> ok iLogic
[03:29:58] <krz> anyone used http://jqvmap.com/ before?
[03:30:06] <krz> I'm wondering if there is a way to add dots on a country
[03:30:09] <ravenzz> sonja you can have a callback for your post request
[03:30:28] <ravenzz> so you can manipulate the DOM on success
[03:30:39] <iLogic> yeah, that's much more responsive
[03:30:41] <ravenzz> (eg. deleting the user container)
[03:30:56] <ravenzz> otherwise it wouldn't make sense to use ajax
[03:30:56] <lijzz> ravenzz To me?
[03:30:57] <ravenzz> :P
[03:31:09] <ravenzz> lijzz one sec
[03:31:13] <lijzz> ok
[03:31:18] <ravenzz> lijzz anyway that is a css question
[03:31:19] <sonja> right now i'm using ajax as a simpler way to post without having a full form
[03:31:26] <sonja> i.e. post from a link
[03:31:29] <ravenzz> that's wrong
[03:31:30] <lijzz> no its a jquery animate
[03:31:47] <ravenzz> sonja it should work even if js is disabled
[03:31:52] <ravenzz> or your script is broken
[03:32:13] <iLogic> progressive enhancement ftw
[03:32:56] <sonja> are you saying i shouldnt be using ajax for that post command?
[03:33:03] <ravenzz> no
[03:33:10] <ravenzz> you should have a regular form
[03:33:35] <ravenzz> so an user will be able to delete
[03:33:44] <sonja> and i can use a link instead of a button
[03:33:53] <ravenzz> no matter if js is enabled or disabled
[03:34:09] <ravenzz> ..

[03:36:22] <ccapndave> Hey there - how can I fire a click on a checkbox?  i.e. I have the checkbox jQuery element in a variable and I want to call something on it so it performs the same operations (including firing events) as if a user had clicked it.
[03:36:35] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[03:36:54] <Mosselmaniac> why is this not working? $("#my_element\\[14\\]").val("test");
[03:37:58] <species> ccapndave: I always recommend you instead do it by firing the thing the click is bound to
[03:38:10] <ravenzz> sonja http://jsfiddle.net/9jV3E/
[03:38:25] <species> ccapndave: for example, if your onclick is "doStuff" then you should instead call doStuff.
[03:38:29] <ccapndave> species: And manually toggle the checkbox state first?
[03:38:44] <species> ccapndave: yes.
[03:38:50] <ccapndave> species: Ok cool, thanks
[03:38:52] <species> ccapndave: also its not manual if code is doing it xD
[03:39:06] <NodeX> Drinking alcohol free lager is like going down on your sister it tastes the same but it just ain't right!
[03:39:19] <ccapndave> species: Manual as in me instead of the library :)
[03:39:42] <species> NodeX: O_O
[03:39:52] <Mosselmaniac> NodeX: wtf #lol
[03:40:00] <species> NodeX: also, most lager is essentially alcohol free
[03:40:17] <sonja> hidden! :D
[03:40:23] <sonja> ravenzz:  you are a great teacher
[03:40:34] <NodeX> yeh lol
[03:41:39] <ravenzz> sonja and in your php script. you should redirect to user.php on success if it is a regular request
[03:42:26] <lijzz> ra-one
[03:42:46] <ravenzz> i need to reply to an email bbl
[03:42:55] <NodeX> Mosselmaniac : [] is not valid as an ID
[03:42:58] <NodeX> or in an ID
[03:43:29] <sanjayb> species: why not just trigger the .click() event ? it tends to keep the code a bit cleaner, no? are there any specific disadvantages to triggering events?
[03:43:36] <tga> sorry, I was away, same question again
[03:43:53] <tga> I have a bunch of deferreds that are pending and I do a $.where(myActions)
[03:44:04] <tga> and the .done() executes right away, even though they're all pending
[03:44:07] <tga> what I am doing wrong?
[03:44:38] <species> sanjayb: mainly because it doesnt work the same way.
[03:44:47] <species> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4624670/using-jquery-to-trigger-html-onclick-event
[03:44:58] <sanjayb> species: thanks for the link.
[03:45:04] <krz> anyone?
[03:45:31] <tga> http://jsfiddle.net/8KQSu/
[03:45:53] <sanjayb> species: but that's just to do whether the event handler was bound by jquery or not .. in this case, if it is bound by jquery, i dont see why not just trigger the event.
[03:46:22] <species> sanjayb: firing the event wont cause the chkbox to change its value
[03:46:28] <lijzz> species, cud u plz check the site http://test2.stocktrends.net/main.php# in ie8

[03:59:50] <huglester> I'm probably doing smth wrong.. but can't figure out what
[04:06:58] <duellsy> huglester: what if you tried self.data[index]['images'].push instead?
[04:07:20] <duellsy> actually ignore that...
[04:08:38] <duellsy> perhaps it's only working on the last one... try [index-1] ?
[04:09:07] <huglester> duellsy: I tried inserting [0] - just to try - but no luck :/
[04:09:45] <species> are you sure that inserting into the collection while you're iterating it is allowed?
[04:11:26] <ryorky1> I'm using this.val in a function, when I alert it, it alerts an empty box(which is fine).  How can I reference that empty val in an if statement?  for example:  if (this.value == ''){whatever here} doesn't seem to work

[06:52:52] <yannickoo> Hey guys, I've two objects: from and to. Both contain day, month and year keys with values. How can I send them dynamically via ajax? I putted cal_data into data but I don't like this way here:
[06:52:53] <yannickoo> var cal_data = 'from_day=' + from.day + '&from_month' + from.month + '&from_year' + from.year + '&to_day' + to.day + '&to_month' + to.month + '&to_year' + to.year;
[06:53:12] <velcrobots> walidvb: i tried that - but the issue is that some lists are very long - much longer than the viewport is tall
[06:53:16] <velcrobots> what then?
[06:54:07] <znow> Ive implemented Roundabout jquery carousel plugin for some images. Im trying to get the clickToFocusCallback to work with AJAX json - the thing is, everytime I click a image, the id of that image should be shown in the console.log output, but it only shows the id of 1, even if clicked on other images - https://gist.github.com/2719061 how should I do this?
[06:54:08] <walidvb> velcrobots: well then you obviously can't really do that
[06:54:32] <walidvb> velcrobots: or actually, you can put the list into a div of size window.height, and have that div scrollable
[06:55:27] <velcrobots> walidvb: yeah, i had something similar to that - it was a bit wonky with the two different scrollbars
[06:55:59] <walidvb> ?jScrollPane @ velcrobots
[06:56:07] <walidvb> if you want to theme the scrollbars
[06:56:09] <yannickoo> What's wrong here? http://pastebin.com/vy5JZfSf

[06:58:18] <velcrobots> overflow-y:scroll
[06:58:41] <walidvb> either that, or look at the doc of jScrollPane if you want to theme your scrollbars
[06:58:41] <velcrobots> then use waypoints to set to position:fixed once scrolled past a certain point
[06:58:49] <walidvb> velcrobots: but yeah
[06:59:15] <walidvb> and bind the resize event to window to resize the height of #col2

[07:06:54] <hlveheart> Hey awesome people
[07:06:57] <dabear> and use .append() / .appendTo

[07:08:24] <hlveheart> Is it possible?

[07:09:03] <dabear> to body

[07:09:26] <dabear> you didn't know how to create elements using jquery? 0o
[07:09:49] <dabear> so how DID you create elements then? plain doc.createElement?
[07:09:58] <walidvb> alright
[07:10:19] <walidvb> no, i did var newDiv = '<div></div>'
[07:10:32] <walidvb> not that i use this so often, but still
[07:11:32] <velcrobots> walidvb: having trouble writing the line to set the height of #col2 - can you help?
[07:11:50] <walidvb> velcrobots: quick, sure
[07:12:53] <walidvb> $('#col2').outerHeight($(window).height()*0.95);
[07:12:56] <walidvb> or smth
[07:13:37] <velcrobots> ok that part i got - but about the binding to window resize?

[07:15:01] <walidvb> @ velcrobots
[07:15:07] <velcrobots> ok thx!
[07:16:25] <petersendidit> znow: looks like data is an object (data.name), what in data do you want to add to the document?  $('.employees_info').html(data.name);
[07:17:11] <DashCC> hm, it looks like jquery.animate does not call the "on animation end" callback right when the animation has ended
[07:17:13] <DashCC> this sucks :/
[07:17:20] <znow> petersendidit: ah yeah okay, but the div doesnt appear though, thats my issue
[07:17:26] <DashCC> any way to make it?
[07:19:01] <sanjayb> DashCC: what do you mean? :) of course it does .. the callback is called when the animation ends? or is that not what you mean?
[07:20:03] <DashCC> I have the feeling that it is called a little before the animation actually ends

[07:27:25] <hlveheart>  How come you can't do something like: xmlhttp.open("GET", "C:\ASP\maintenancescroll.htm", true);
[07:28:16] <hlveheart> Say you have a file that's located in C:\ASP\, outside of the main website directory
[07:28:27] <hlveheart> Is there truly no way you can ajax to access it?
[07:28:31] <chilversc_> hlveheart: because browsers block file:// requests for security
[07:29:17] <chilversc_> hlveheart: and now it sounds like you're asking about fetching a page on a server via ajax that isn't part of the website, which would be a hell of a security issue
[07:29:29] <hlveheart> I can do something like <!--#include file="C:\ASP\maintenancescroll.htm"--> just fine
[07:29:36] <hlveheart> No errors, or anything
[07:29:38] <aaronmcadam> that's completely different
[07:29:52] <aaronmcadam> you're missing the point
[07:29:57] <chilversc_> hlveheart: yes, because that is running at the server side, but the ajax request is running at the client's browser
[07:30:16] <hlveheart> Ah, figured there was security reasoning behind that
[07:30:26] <chilversc_> hlveheart: its just a normal request, no different to if they wrote the address in the browser's address bar
[07:30:41] <hlveheart> I need to figure out an alternative to this though, basically taht maintscroll is a newsticker that scrolls through the latest headlines
[07:31:14] <hlveheart> Hmph
[07:31:49] <hlveheart> Hard to explain, but basically I fear that if it's static like that on every page, (as it curently is, as it's sitting in my master.master) it's going to ultimately ruin my SEO
[07:32:46] <NoiseEee> right, because people googling news headlines should go to your site?
[07:33:10] <hlveheart> I think you misunderstood?
[07:33:12] <vlad27aug> qom2: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/HZ8TB/11/
[07:33:29] <hlveheart> yeah, pretty sure you misunderstood
[07:34:01] <chilversc_> hlveheart: so make it available as a page on the site, and then use ajax to fetch it?
[07:34:10] <qom2> amazing vlad27aug, thank you so much :)
[07:34:21] <chilversc_> well, page fragment, since it wouldn't be a full html page
[07:35:38] <vlad27aug> qom2: no problem
[07:36:05] <qom2> vlad27aug: quick question, when selecting the different inputs, there's some blank spaces behind each text, why's that?
[07:36:44] <orangey1> hello all
[07:36:55] <orangey1> how best to populate a set of options with jquery using some json info?
[07:37:06] <orangey1> I can't even get my json file called!
[07:37:09] <vlad27aug> qom2: because the .text() method extracts all the text from the selected element...and in each 'p' there are some white spaces...they get added too
[07:37:10] <orangey1> despite trying several tutorials
[07:37:19] <qom2> right
[07:37:23] <hlveheart> Hm
[07:37:45] <vlad27aug> you can fix that by replacing the first function line with var str = $.trim($(this).text());
[07:38:24] <qom2> you rock, thanks!
[07:38:35] <vlad27aug> or even nicer: var str = $(this).text().trim();
[07:45:32] <orangey1> gah. I have just about the easiest scrpt in the world, but i tstill won't hit my server for the json!
[07:45:52] <orangey1> $(document).ready(function(){ $.getJSON('/kitab/trades/add.json', function(data) {  $('#getresults').html (JSON.stringify(data));  }); });
[07:46:18] <quicksilver> if you visit /kitab/trades/add.json directly on your browser does it look right?
[07:46:49] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jqueryui: jQuery UI 1.9m8 is out, featuring Position API redesign and accessibility improvements for Autocomplete and Tooltip http://t.co/a8sMEk4o â˜… http://bit.ly/KvYKPc
[07:47:57] <orangey1> quicksilver: it does t ome.
[07:48:08] <ebright> Did something replace .sub() when it got deprecated? What's best practice to override jQuery functionality? I quite like the idea of calling my custom jQuery function through $$(selector).doCustom().
[07:48:35] <quicksilver> orangey1: put an alert () in that callback and see if it gets called at all.
[07:48:54] <orangey1> quicksilver: just alert('test'); ?
[07:48:57] <quicksilver> yup
[07:50:08] <shwaiil> Q: How to unbind a .mousemove event from one element ? I'm trying to do a draggable button in a horizontal bar http://jsfiddle.net/heldrida/pzC7T/1/ thanks for looking
[07:50:30] <quicksilver> ebright: the jquery ui widget factory is the best way. If you you just a single doCustom there is no harm in just writing $.fn.doCustom = function () { ... }
[07:51:12] <orangey1> quicksilver: http://jsfiddle.net/Mbqrb/
[07:51:15] <sanjayb> shwaiil: maybe if you bind it with .bind("mousemove") instead of .mousemove(..) , but im also guessing a bit ..
[07:51:15] <orangey1> that gives me no alert
[07:51:32] <shwaiil> sanjayb: tks for looking, i'll try that
[07:51:55] <orangey1> is there some kind of publicly accessible json file somewhere that I can tap?
[07:52:21] <shwaiil> sanjayb: hmm doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/heldrida/pzC7T/2/
[07:52:31] <shwaiil> it works but... sometimes it doesn unbind
[07:52:33] <ebright> I want to override $.fn.val but only for certain elements
[07:52:36] <DashCC> can I use normal jquery methods on documentFragments ?
[07:52:58] <ebright> I prefer to call $$(selector).val() for those specific elements
[07:53:05] <sanjayb> shwaiil: hmm .. it seems to work for me ..
[07:53:16] <vlad27aug> DashCC: sure
[07:53:21] <quicksilver> orangey1: well you're missing the closing ' on test
[07:53:36] <DashCC> vlad27aug: thanks :-)
[07:53:37] <shwaiil> sanjayb: do some more, like click stop dragging, click again...
[07:53:47] <sanjayb> shwaiil: you're right, sometimes it seems to act naughty
[07:53:48] <walidvb> if i bind 2 functions to the same event, will it do both?
[07:53:52] <orangey1> quicksilver: hehe ; ) Not in my original code. regardless, it still appears not to trigger an alert
[07:53:55] <shwaiil> sanjayb: yeah :X
[07:54:01] <sanjayb> shwaiil: im pretty sure i've run into this before and it nearly destroyed my mind
[07:54:06] <NoiseEee> walidvb: tias  (yes, but thats something you should try before asking)
[07:54:11] <shwaiil> sanjayb:  lol
[07:54:12] <sanjayb> shwaiil: is behaviour the same across browsers?
[07:54:22] <shwaiil> I'm going to test in chrome right now
[07:54:44] <walidvb> NoiseEee: you're right.. :/
[07:54:49] <diamonds> can I find what's bound to ready?
[07:54:58] <sanjayb> shwaiil: so .. i think the problem may be .. when the mouseup doesn't actually occur on .line
[07:54:59] <orangey1> quicksilver: this one does:
[07:55:07] <diamonds> most things are $(document).data('events').resize etc.
[07:55:21] <shwaiil> sanjayb: works in chrome. I see your point, maybe I'll add the same for the nested element
[07:55:30] <sanjayb> shwaiil: what if you do something like $(window).mouseup(function() $('.line').unbind("mousemove"); });
[07:55:31] <shwaiil> or just document or html
[07:55:36] <shwaiil> sanjayb: ok
[07:55:52] <diamonds> but $(document).data("events").ready is undefined
[07:55:56] <sanjayb> shwaiil: try that .. that would seem to make logical sense .. since you can drag and then mouseup when you're not actually on the element
[07:56:18] <shwaiil> sanjayb: yeah, you're right, didn't worked though http://jsfiddle.net/heldrida/pzC7T/3/
[07:56:25] <shwaiil> but makes more sense
[07:56:59] <quicksilver> orangey1: your ajax call must not be working.
[07:57:12] <quicksilver> orangey1: check in firebug/inspector to see what's happening.
[07:57:13] <sanjayb> shwaiil: seems to be a lot better for me now.
[07:57:26] <orangey1> quicksilver: ok
[07:58:59] <orangey1> quicksilver: i'm not getting any errors I can see in firebug
[07:59:18] <orangey1> Even so, check out that jsfiddle.. shouldn't that work? http://jsfiddle.net/Mbqrb/3/
[07:59:23] <DashCC> vlad27aug: do you know what happens internally if I use $('div') ?
[07:59:27] <orangey1> does 'test2' appear for you?
[08:00:07] <quicksilver> orangey1: no
[08:00:14] <quicksilver> orangey1: that's cross-domain ajax which is not permitted.
[08:00:26] <orangey1> quicksilver: oh.
[08:00:43] <orangey1> quicksilver: well, how can you do jsfiddle with any json stuff, then?
[08:01:10] <quicksilver> orangey1: see the documentation in the left panel
[08:01:17] <thomasmyrman> Hello, is there any way to perform a task after $('element').html(data) has been run?
[08:01:19] <orangey1> right. just saw that
[08:01:21] <orangey1> http://jsfiddle.net/Mbqrb/4/
[08:01:22] <orangey1> that works now
[08:01:33] <thomasmyrman> Or do I just check for html in that element?
[08:01:33] <quicksilver> yup
[08:01:48] <quicksilver> thomasmyrman: just perform the task in the next line of code.
[08:02:04] <thomasmyrman> It doesn't work as expected though
[08:02:05] <quicksilver> $('element').html(data); now do something else;
[08:02:34] <sanjayb> thomasmyrman: what doesn't work, exactly? example?
[08:02:43] <thomasmyrman> I'm filling an element with data using .get, and then displaying the element, but it stutters
[08:02:56] <thomasmyrman> I mean, it hasn't loaded fully when I show the element
[08:03:15] <quicksilver> "hasn't loaded fully"?
[08:03:20] <quicksilver> images it contains, for example
[08:03:27] <quicksilver> will come down later, is that what you mean?
[08:03:42] <diamonds> I'm trying to test that something was triggered on ready
[08:03:48] <thomasmyrman> quicksilver: correct
[08:04:02] <diamonds> is there any way to a) see what was bound to doc.ready or b) trigger doc.ready manually?
[08:04:02] <thomasmyrman> I'd like to show the element when everything in it has loaded
[08:05:24] <quicksilver> thomasmyrman: you can use the .load event on the images
[08:05:32] <quicksilver> I'm not sure if there is a clever way to wait for all of them.
[08:06:38] <quicksilver> thomasmyrman: https://github.com/alexanderdickson/waitForImages/blob/master/README.md maybe
[08:06:41] <quicksilver> (untested)
[08:06:57] <thomasmyrman> Thank you :)
[08:08:03] <aJacom> I want to make a dashed input for a form, like this: Hi, my name is _ _ _ and I... (etc). The user would be able to write in the  _ _ _'s
[08:08:07] <aJacom> Tips?
[08:08:24] <FJ1> mask plugin.
[08:09:11] <FJ1> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[08:09:13] <aJacom> this one? -> http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[08:09:16] <aJacom> yep :)
[08:10:05] <aJacom> Hmm not really. The length is not important. I want the user to be able to type in any number of characters in the input
[08:10:20] <aJacom> Validation is not the issue, the issue is presenting the input with that shape
[08:10:20] <eamonnw> i cant overide a submit button default actoin
[08:10:22] <eamonnw> http://pastebin.com/L1TbM1zj
[08:10:28] <aJacom> maybe this is just a CSS question ?
[08:11:13] <eamonnw> when i click the submit button it still does the normal default GET
[08:11:45] <eamonnw> and the console.log message doesn't appear
[08:11:50] <eamonnw> halp
[08:12:00] <eamonnw> what am i doin wrong
[08:12:43] <FJ1> replace event.preventDefault(); with return false;
[08:15:17] <eamonnw> FJ1: still behaves teh same way
[08:16:50] <eamonnw> i think i've ruled out a problem with teh html
[08:16:53] <Gsingh> Can I iterate through all form elements by doing something like this http://pastebin.com/CxPxSxYt
[08:17:21] <Gsingh> Or will that iterate over all elements regardless?
[08:17:45] <species> Gsingh: im guessing, all elements regardless, since you dont specify which list of elements
[08:17:45] <hlveheart> How would I use ajax to display the contents of /LoginAjax.htm ?
[08:18:07] <species> Gsingh: there is no connection between the scope and the specific form other than semantics, which the inner .each cannot determine
[08:18:33] <species> Gsingh: unless there is some global state going on which would be a terrible, terrible idea
[08:19:02] <wunz> hlveheart: try using .load onto a div
[08:20:12] <Gsingh> species: thanks, what about doing #form.formElement for the selector would that work?
[08:21:06] <Gsingh> sorry I meant form.Element or something like that
[08:21:38] <hlveheart> $('#resultajax').load('LoginAjax.htm');
[08:21:41] <hlveheart> Something like this?
[08:21:55] <wunz> yes
[08:22:19] <hlveheart> Question though
[08:22:30] <hlveheart> can I not use server side include on loginajax.htm?
[08:22:54] <hlveheart> I'm basically using the load loginajax as a middle man, to serve out <!--#include file="C:\ASP\maintenancescroll.htm"-->
[08:23:06] <hlveheart> Can I not do something like that?
[08:23:34] <wunz> that would put that maintenancescroll code onto your loginajax page
[08:24:05] <wunz> i thought you wanted to display contents on loginajax onto your current page
[08:24:10] <hlveheart> right, but it isn't working when I try to serve it out using .load
[08:24:25] <wunz> what does it say?
[08:24:39] <hlveheart> No error, I even added an alert to try and get it to verify it's loading
[08:24:53] <hlveheart> It's just not placing the contents of maintenancescroll.htm
[08:24:55] <diverdude> Anybody ever tried to use open street maps for their web pages in here?
[08:25:51] <wunz> i blv what the .load does is takes the html of loginAjax and loads it into the div to display; therefore, that include wouldn't render
[08:26:10] <wunz> in order for it to render, you'd need to have it placed in your current page rather than the loginAjax
[08:26:25] <wunz> if you want it to render within the loginAjax page, then i suggest you use iframes
[08:26:34] <hlveheart> that's what i was afraid of

[08:44:23] <gho5t> Brodingo_: do you mean the context by using .call?
[08:44:48] <Brodingo_> rohanrhu its probably a better use of your time to read up on canvas and such then asking people to clarify specific lines of code
[08:45:20] <Brodingo_> gho5t el.find('a').click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); self.DoWidgetMethod('Param'); });

[08:49:05] <Brodingo_> rohanrhu i could but none of what your asking is jquery, you should try to find the appropriate channel
[08:51:36] <aaronmcadam> i don't agree on query only questions, what he needs to do is follow your advice and actually do some reading

[09:39:50] <orangey> woo!!!
[09:39:55] <orangey> This is wonderful
[09:41:01] * hlveheart slaps orangey around a bit with a large trout
[09:41:06] <hlveheart> you are wonderful
[09:41:15] <orangey> hlveheart: heheh ; ) Thank you
[09:42:05] <orangey> hlveheart: i'm just elated and feel empowered and loved. Having had to set aside this program for ~ 6 months, I'm back at it full steam..
[09:42:36] <orangey> and now that I've cracked AJAX, I feel like the whole world lays before me.
[09:47:58] <jormo> can someone explain this unintuitive behavior... i'm doing console.log($(this), $('.foo:last'), $(this).is('.foo:last'), $(this)[0] === $('.foo:last')[0]) and it prints:  <form class="foo"> <form class="foo"> false true
[09:48:09] <jormo> why is the ".is()" returning false
[09:48:18] <jormo> when the two wrapped elements are clearly identical
[09:48:52] <jormo> using jquery 1.7.2, btw
[09:50:24] <NoiseEee> jormo:
[09:50:26] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/EdKFJ/
[09:50:29] <NoiseEee> sorry laggy paste
[09:50:51] <NoiseEee> jormo: if you want to compare elements, compare elements.  you were comparing jquery objects.
[09:51:56] <jormo> yes i know... but that's what i thought the .is() function did
[09:52:17] <jormo> the documentation even seems to suggest it with their examples
[09:52:28] <jormo> otherwise what's the purpose of .is() ?
[09:52:39] <NoiseEee> to find out what type of tag the element is
[09:52:53] <jormo> the example is showing more than just tag selectors
[09:53:11] <jormo> it says selector (any selector)
[09:53:13] <jormo> not just tag
[09:55:29] <jormo> if it's only supposed to work with tag selectors then it should explicitly state that
[09:55:50] <NoiseEee> no it would work with any selector
[09:55:53] <jormo> the documentation just says it checks if the contents of the jquery object are anywhere in the list
[09:56:37] <jormo> well i just showed you an instance where .is() and === don't return the same thing
[09:56:46] <multiHYP> hi all
[09:57:07] <multiHYP> $(document).ready(function() {â€¦}); how can I disable/unbind this?
[09:57:12] <jormo> $(this).is('.foo:last') returned false, but $(this)[0] === $('.foo:last')[0] returned true
[09:57:23] <jormo> in the same log call
[09:57:44] <orangey> ok, off. see you all later!
[10:00:05] <BrixSat> Hello

[10:00:50] <BrixSat> multiHYP hi
[10:01:13] <BrixSat> im using jquery ui map and i cant move a marker in the map :S  marker.setPosition(new google.maps.LatLng(auxmarker.latitude, auxmarker.longitude)); im using this
[10:02:59] <NoiseEee> jormo: maybe the jquery faux-properties don't work there... http://jsfiddle.net/EdKFJ/1/
[10:04:19] <jormo> noiseee, but they're used in the .is() examples
[10:04:26] <jormo> they specificially use :last
[10:09:31] <jormo> looks like :last-child works
[10:09:41] <jormo> but that's not exactly the same thing
[10:09:44] <jormo> as :last
[10:10:14] <jormo> oh well, i'll just stop using .is() and compare the dom nodes instead
[10:12:59] <NoiseEee> jormo: sorry, wish i knew more about it.  only way i could get it was by querying another selector and looking.  http://jsfiddle.net/EdKFJ/2/
[10:16:36] <ailaG> in jquery mobile i need a div to stay constant through page changes and animation, any idea? i tried playing with $.mobile.pageContainer but i can't get it to work

[10:20:21] <sanova> i have a question. i have an accordion. how can i count items in collpased section after doing a filter ? using ":visible" option doesn't work because of it returns always 0 for collapsed section. how can i identify them?
[10:21:47] <Emn1ty> sanova: you could take the number of items - the number of visible objects.
[10:24:10] <ngharo> won't it always be total - 1
[10:25:11] <Emn1ty> I guess that's true
[10:25:39] <Emn1ty> unless you have multiple collapsed and visible elements
[10:25:47] <Emn1ty> rather than just one visible element
[10:26:33] <sanova> Emn1ty: i'm doing that now.. items not found are hidden by filter in all sections of accordion, so when i count section by section using ":visible" it returns always 0 for items found in collapsed section and it works only for expanded section
[10:27:11] <shoky> why are you using :visible
[10:27:23] <sanova> shoky: what can i use ?
[10:27:33] <shoky> maybe i didn't understand what you're after
[10:27:35] <sanova> hidden ?
[10:27:43] <shoky> what do you want to count
[10:27:53] <Emn1ty> hidden items inside an accordian
[10:27:58] <shoky> what does that mean
[10:28:04] <shoky> what items?
[10:28:49] <sanova> i mean: filter hides items not found in each section.
[10:29:18] <shoky> what items are you talking about :\
[10:29:43] <shoky> and what filter
[10:29:51] <Emn1ty> sanova: I think it would help if you provided your code/an example
[10:29:53] <sanova> i would like to count items found (and so visible) even if sections in that time is collapsed
[10:30:07] <shoky> found != visible
[10:30:24] <shoky> what items? what does 'found' mean?
[10:30:39] <shoky> why does found mean they are visible?
[10:30:42] <sanova> yes, but filter hides items not found
[10:30:47] <shoky> what filter?
[10:30:52] <shoky> why would a filter hide items
[10:32:03] <Emn1ty> sanova: http://jsfiddle.net/ - give us something to look at
[10:32:04] <sanova> example: 2 items in first section: red, black; 1 items in second collapsed section: green
[10:32:20] <shoky> then why would you use  :visible?
[10:32:27] <shoky> you want to count only visible items?
[10:33:02] <sanova> filter works in this way: when i digit "r" it hides second item of first section: black because not contains "r"
[10:33:40] <shoky> wat.
[10:34:16] <Emn1ty> sanova: your naming conventions aren't apparent to us, so you need to show us what you're doing in context. Everything your telling us is out of context.
[10:34:45] <sanova> code

[10:36:06] <shoky> ungh
[10:36:06] <Emn1ty> probably spelled it wrong
[10:36:17] <shoky> yep
[10:36:32] <Emn1ty> been too long since I looked at how it was spelled.
[10:37:33] <Emn1ty> missing a few things, reverse a few things, meh

[10:42:04] <NielsMob> hello i have a little issue with the UI dialog box; it does not want to be centered anymore.
[10:42:55] <vladyn> anyone used UI tabs with jquery address ?
[10:43:08] <smykes> anyone had an issue with bootstrap popover making ajax calls twice?
[10:43:37] <NielsMob> have a look here: can some one play with the new POS https://theme.fusionticket.nl/pos/ testme testme and let me know of the dialog boxes are shown centered on the screen?
[10:43:37] <NielsMob> and press the seating chart button
[10:46:11] <shoky> no its not centered
[10:46:38] <shoky> also when resizing it it gets problematic
[10:52:38] <smykes> Anyone Twitter Bootstrap making ajax calls twice?
[10:53:43] <sanova> i solved adding a class "hide" or "visible" during filtering
[10:53:58] <smykes> is there a maximum json length for ajax returns?
[10:54:46] <smykes> or size
[10:55:01] <easytiger> is there a prefered way of getting an opaque page overlay loading another page in the middle?
[10:55:06] <sanova> http://pastebin.com/pXjcFt15  code
[11:01:14] <rabbi1> I would like to use "input" as a .selector in validate.js..... can i use it? if i use #login form in place of selector it works....
[11:01:27] <rabbi1> any suggestion pls ^^
[11:02:09] <rossdm> after appending html to an element, is there a way to detect the ready event to know that it's safe to query the document for the added elements?
[11:03:49] <hariom> I have an input box where I have a string as default value. If the user clicks the text box, that string disappears but If he doesn't write anything in it and takes the focus away from the text box, that string should appear again. How to set that feature in <input ...> tag itself. I have written something like:  <input value='User Name' onclick=" ''; "  onblur="if (!this.value) 'User Name';"> but it doesn't seem to work
[11:04:00] <splig> hi there! i try to use parent and then select an element inside it but not success
[11:04:41] <splig> if i have an img and input in the same td and i do, when the img is clicked: $(this).parent("input") shoulnt it work???
[11:04:51] <hariom> splig: try something like: $('parent > child')
[11:04:56] <herokudev> rossdm: if there is, it's highly browser-specific. if you can find another strategy you'll be better off.
[11:05:48] <herokudev> rossdm: one way is to put javascript in the html you're appending, and have that js send an event.
[11:06:21] <splig> hariom, i dont understand. as string?? what parent and child mens here?
[11:06:31] <rossdm> @herokudev sure...I hate to have to do that but might be no other way
[11:07:17] <herokudev> rossdm: at least it would be robust.
[11:07:39] <hariom> splig: For example, if you have parent as a div and inside that if you have input tag then to select input you can do something like: $('div > input'). Another simple way is to assign 'id' to that element and access it directly: $('input#someid')
[11:07:41] <rossdm> better than Not Working. Thanks ;)
[11:07:50] <brettster> anyone in here have ie9?
[11:08:33] <anjen> Hi all, I have a quick question. When I use the logical form of  (something) ? this:that , how do I excapsulated multiple commands for "this" and "that"? I tried using brackets {}, but the javascript parser failed.
[11:08:49] <splig> if i have <td><input><img></td>. i want to access input from img with onclick event. parent('>input')??
[11:09:26] <anjen> or assing aqn id or class to the img, and acces viua #id, .class , or img#id img.class
[11:09:53] <gaius65> Hi!
[11:10:11] <anjen> ie, $('#img_id').someCommandFunction();
[11:10:34] <gaius65> Does anyone know of an simple example where jQuery-code fails because the programmer didn't understood closure?
[11:12:02] <caaakeeey> possibly slightly bias here, but any thoughts on qunit vs vows vs jasmine
[11:12:02] <Less_Seen> splig: $('img').click(function(){$(this).closest('td').find('input').val('something like along these lines?');});
[11:12:13] <hariom> splig: Try something like: <td><input id='some-id'/><img id='some-src-id'/></td>  then $("img#some-src-id").click(function() { $("input#some-id").val() });
[11:12:25] <anjen> ^^
[11:13:14] <brettster> hariom can you help me with something not jquery related
[11:13:43] <splig> Less_Seen, that's iiiiiit!!!!!!
[11:13:53] <splig> closest is going up in DOM and find going down??
[11:13:59] <thinkt4nk> yes
[11:14:00] <splig> or something like this???
[11:14:05] <splig> hariom, thanks a lot
[11:14:16] <splig> great great great. thanks a lot
[11:14:23] <hariom> splig: welcome
[11:14:31] <splig> i was more than one hour trying it... damm
[11:14:52] <Less_Seen> anjen: use an if/else in that case, instead of a ternary operation
[11:15:27] <Less_Seen> good thing splig
[11:15:52] <hariom> brettster: what is that you are holding? If jquery is not the right forum for your question pls ask it in appropriate forum
[11:25:24] <Ox41> ok, I think jquery is probably the easiest way for me to do this.
[11:25:40] <Ox41> I have a page that I need to turn parts into thumbnails.
[11:26:04] <Ox41> ie. ABCDEF needs to turn into <img src="foo.bar/ABCDEFG.jpg" />
[11:30:59] <shoky> o_O
[11:32:07] <Ox41> O_o
[11:32:24] <shoky> need any halp?
[11:33:00] <Ox41> me?
[11:33:04] <shoky> yes
[11:33:07] <Ox41> yeah thats why I asked :P
[11:33:12] <shoky> you didn't ask
[11:33:20] <Ox41> I guess I did just say what I was doing... :(
[11:33:21] <Less_Seen> ,_,
[11:33:26] <Ox41> lol good catch
[11:33:28] <shoky> and what you said i'm not sure i understood
[11:33:37] <WhiteWizzard> hi all
[11:33:50] <Less_Seen> hai
[11:33:54] <WhiteWizzard> I have a question with jQuery UI accordion
[11:34:04] <shoky> hot topic of the day
[11:34:10] <Ox41> I have a page, not generated by me. Im making a bookmarklet that turns piecees of it that match a criteria (basically ALL caps, A-Z 0-9, 5 or 6 digits) into img tags
[11:34:31] <WhiteWizzard> I am getting an extra space when I have the slide down animation that clears when the animation is done
[11:34:41] <lotus> hey, I have a bookmarklet which loads jquery and then executes getScript('my.js');  --  I want to make sure that a function in my.js only executes once because it adds a dom element to the page.  I have tried arguments.callee._executed and I've tried setting variables in the global scope of my.js -- both are reset to undefined after I press the bookmarklet a second time.  Any help is appreciated.  http://jsfiddle.net/ncSdY/ this is the code
[11:35:25] <WhiteWizzard> its like for the animation  has a newline until the animation is done, has anyone come accross this before?
[11:35:31] <WhiteWizzard> *across
[11:35:41] <shoky> lotus why not add some data to the DOM as your flag, and check if its set each time
[11:35:46] <lotus> WhiteWizzard: could you post a working example of the problem?
[11:35:56] <lotus> shoky: Ah!  That's a great idea.
[11:36:09] <shoky> groovy
[11:36:41] <shoky> if you got jquery loaded then .data(...) on some element (like body) is the best way to go
[11:37:01] <shoky> hmm actually maybe not, im not sure
[11:37:06] <lotus> shoky: I was gonna do a if (!$('#myElement')) { load my element }
[11:37:10] <Goopyo> hey is putting jquery in the body frequently a bad idea?
[11:37:34] <lotus> Goopyo: I've had trouble loading jquery in my footers
[11:37:57] <lotus> Goopyo: if you're worried about loading speeds, use google's CDN for Caching and to take advantage of their global network
[11:37:58] <Goopyo> interesting
[11:38:00] <shoky> lotus:  that works but it's not a boolean so try:   if ( ! $('#myElement').length )
[11:38:13] <lotus> Goopyo: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CGcQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fencosia.com%2F3-reasons-why-you-should-let-google-host-jquery-for-you%2F&ei=i0W1T9OPMYnGgAf5roEL&usg=AFQjCNFoTA7iC2eJnFdUgtaer1aVNWMOTA
[11:38:55] <lotus> shoky: Greatness.
[11:39:00] <Goopyo> lotus: I am using google's jquery, I was curious about putting functions/scripts in the body
[11:39:00] <Ox41> so I guess my question is, using the $().replace() function, how can I take the matched criteria and turn it into a variable to use in the replaced part?
[11:39:44] <shoky> there isn't any $().replace()
[11:40:14] <Ox41> <_<
[11:40:19] <Ox41> sorry
[11:40:22] <Ox41> string.replace()
[11:40:31] <WhiteWizzard> http://jsfiddle.net/6YqMe/
[11:40:51] <shoky> 0x41 you might wanna do that with regex
[11:40:53] <WhiteWizzard> That should be it, I don't believe it matters, but I am using rails 2
[11:41:02] <WhiteWizzard> *rails 3 to generate this
[11:41:03] <smykes> ajpiano you arround?
[11:41:22] <Ox41> shoky: yeah, it uses a regex
[11:41:47] <shoky> ok so if you put parens around whatever you wanna replace
[11:42:03] <lotus> Goopyo: oh, that shouldn't be an issue
[11:42:20] <shoky> then you can use $1 $2 etc
[11:42:33] <lotus> Goopyo: If you've already got jquery loaded, just put your code in $(document).ready(function(){ code here });
[11:42:46] <lotus> Hi A! :)
[11:42:49] <lotus> wait,
[11:42:53] <lotus> 41, yeah that's A
[11:42:54] <lotus> :)
[11:43:14] <shoky> except he's an Ox not an 0x
[11:43:26] <lotus> darn.  ;P
[11:43:30] <shoky> ;p
[11:43:38] <Ox41> im technically an 0x
[11:43:45] <Ox41> But you can't start a nickname with a 0 ;)
[11:44:09] <shoky> your testicles are large either way
[11:44:37] <lotus> Zer0-Ex ftw
[11:45:07] <WhiteWizzard> lotus?
[11:45:20] <tw2113> do they hang low shoky ?
[11:45:23] <splig> another question. i have an for every table row. when i add via jquery some row this event does not apply to it. why??
[11:45:29] <shoky> in my mind
[11:45:35] <smykes> How do people deal with popups in a table where a user has the potential to mouse over a bunch of cells in  a row that all trigger an ajax call?
[11:46:04] <termite> we hide under our desks
[11:46:05] <Back2Basics> a popup blocker.
[11:46:17] <Back2Basics> they stop visiting the site.
[11:46:35] <Back2Basics> they complain in the forums
[11:46:37] <smykes> popobver
[11:46:46] <smykes> like more information about the table cell
[11:46:57] <NoiseEee> mousing over something starts an xhr call?
[11:47:07] <Back2Basics> how about an onclick event instead
[11:47:21] <smykes> well it cals a popover which makes an ajax call
[11:47:34] <Goopyo> lotus: a thanks, and can I put multiple functions in document.read or just call document.ready multiple times?
[11:47:44] <splig> oh found. i should use live instead of on
[11:47:46] <splig> thanks
[11:47:48] <NoiseEee> smykes: "How do people deal with" what does that mean?
[11:47:52] <NoiseEee> splig: nope
[11:47:53] <shoky> splig no you shouldn't
[11:47:54] <Back2Basics> smykes: find "hover" and delete
[11:48:06] <smykes> NoiseEee what is the prefered method of doing this?
[11:48:06] <splig> no? uups, so it does what i wanted to
[11:48:10] <splig> so? what is the point?
[11:48:40] <Ox41> string.replace(/([^0-9A-Z]){5,6}/g, '<b>' + $1 + '</b>')
[11:48:43] <NoiseEee> smykes: keep track of the 'popup' and make sure the xhr loaded stuff goes to that one only?  im just not sure what the issue is
[11:48:46] <Ox41> is that right looking?
[11:49:08] <shoky> Ox41:  '<b>$1</b>'
[11:49:14] <termite> smykes, is the issue that you are making a ton of requests
[11:49:32] <smykes> NoiseEee the problem is the possibility of like 25 ajax calls if someone just mouses over the table
[11:49:34] <shoky> Ox41: but no i think you need more parens
[11:49:46] <splig> NoiseEee, shoky why not??? it looks like i wanted... where is the problem? what i should use?
[11:50:20] <NoiseEee> smykes: if you're loading some basic info, or something that can really be defined/stored at initial page load,  i'd put that info into an object on the page and query that instead of making an xhr call
[11:50:31] <NoiseEee> smykes: not sure if thats feasible for you, but sounds like it might be
[11:50:35] <termite> smokes, do a timer that starts when they mouse over if they start in the cell a certain amount of time then the call is made
[11:50:37] <shoky> splig: you should use .on ,  something like:  $('#myTable').on('click', 'tr.someClass', function () { ..... } )
[11:50:48] <lotus> Goopyo: you can call document.ready() multiple times, sure.  But you could also make the functions out side of document ready and call the functions in the document.ready() callback function.  i.e. $(document).ready(function() {f1(p1,p2,p3); f2(); ...});
[11:50:51] <shoky> splig: read the docs about .on(), especially the part about event delegation
[11:50:56] <aclockworkpeter> what is the full path for jQuery
[11:51:03] <smykes> termite yeah i though of that
[11:51:13] <splig> shoky, ok thanks
[11:51:15] <macmartine> Why the heck would "$(".wc-scrollable-grid").height(20)" give this error in IE 8 "Object does not support this property or method" ?
[11:51:16] <smykes> im trying to do it with this twitter bootstrap plugin so its tricky
[11:51:20] <Goopyo> lotus: thanks so much
[11:51:25] <lotus> Goopyo: glhf!
[11:51:33] <aclockworkpeter> what is the full path for jquery if I don't want to include it in the project
[11:51:43] <termite> smykes, I have built interative maps and they only make a call when some sits over an element of 500 ms
[11:52:05] <jstout24> I have a jquery ui dialog that is loading content via ajaxâ€¦ using .dialog(â€¦).load(â€¦) with the remote content being javascript works, but using .dialog(â€¦) then doing a $.get inside the dialog's open callback, it's not producing the same resultsâ€¦ any reason why?
[11:52:07] <smykes> termite it makes sense, I'm just having issues making it work with this bootstrap plugin
[11:53:13] <termite> smokes, got a jsfiddle I can play with
[11:53:18] <parco> is setInterval pretty stable amongst browsers?
[11:53:28] <smykes> termite im going to try and do one in two seconds
[11:53:30] <shoky> parco: best to use setTimeout repeatedly
[11:53:51] <parco> shoky, is that javascript native?
[11:54:35] <shoky> its in the DOM specification i believe
[11:55:00] <shoky> all browsers support it
[11:55:13] <termite> parco,  yeah I have used it forever
[11:55:29] <parco> eh not doing much with it, ill leave it for now
[11:55:48] <shoky> it's stable amongst browsers, yes
[11:57:47] <thinkt4nk> why do folks often say that using recursive setTimeout is better than setInterval?
[11:58:07] <ebright> Is there such a thing as find next "focusable" element?
[11:59:35] <parco> thinkt4nk, setTimeout() ensures the looped code executed completely before starting again?
[11:59:36] <shoky> thinkt4nk: because with setInterval, your function is going to be called every X ms, even if something in the function is lagging/delayed
[11:59:53] <parco> yea, that ^
[11:59:56] <shoky> with setTimeout you have full control
[12:00:13] <Whirl3d> Good afternoon all. Is there a way to address the items registered to a deferred's resolve? In other words, inside of animation call, I would like to publish the "step" action to update subscribers and thought maybe I could leverage a deferred like I do with the complete action/callback.
[12:00:37] <shoky> g'eve
[12:00:39] <thinkt4nk> I see
[12:01:02] <thinkt4nk> but then it wouldn't necessarily be a constant interval
[12:01:02] <ebright> I have a bunch of buttons some nested in spans and such and some can be hidden which is why .next() isn't really a solution. 'Tab'ing works great though - that's what I want to achieve through the use of the cursor keys aswell!
[12:01:12] <shoky> that'd be up to you
[12:01:14] <thinkt4nk> in fact, it would necessarily _not_ be a constant interval
[12:01:27] <shoky> you dont have to give the same interval each time to setTimeout
[12:02:00] <thinkt4nk> correct, but what are you going to do, subtract the execution time from the constant interval to determine the timeout for the next call?
[12:02:06] <thinkt4nk> that seems a bit kludgey
[12:02:08] <shoky> exactly
[12:02:13] <thinkt4nk> hmm
[12:02:21] <thinkt4nk> ok, well, thanks for the explanation
[12:02:23] <shoky> its more kludgey than using setInterval, yes
[12:02:35] <thinkt4nk> but yeah, like you said, you have more control
[12:02:37] <shoky> but for time-critical stuff it's more stable usually
[12:02:39] <Whirl3d> ebright, can you check for "tabIndex" attribute? var nextTab=$("*["tabIndex"]).next()....?
[12:04:10] <ebright> oh nevermind! By using :focusable =)
[12:04:36] <Whirl3d> :focusable? Wow, they thought of everything.
[12:06:06] <shoky> Whirl3d: i didnt really undferstand your q
[12:06:58] <smykes> termite this is what I'm going to try http://jsfiddle.net/KLCzs/10/
[12:07:48] <Ox41> any idea why I would get "uncaught exception: ReferenceError: window is not defined"
[12:07:49] <termite> smykes, let me taek a look
[12:08:01] <Ox41> I mean, 'window' should be a valid var,no?
[12:08:15] <shoky> what code is causing that
[12:08:44] <Ox41> its a bookmarklet jquery wrapper...
[12:08:57] <amaroks> Hello, I have .get(function() {} ) , I want somehting like die() how can I do so in jquery?
[12:09:29] <amaroks> I want to stop excuting any code after that using a function like die
[12:09:33] <Less_Seen> return
[12:09:36] <Whirl3d> Shoky, thanks for the reply. I use deferred's like a single-state pub/sub system. So, I create a startDefer object and a CompleteDefer object that I return during an initial animation sequence setup allowing me to use the syntax: $(elem).anim(props, actions).then(doSomething)....but also lets other elements access the deferred's promise like $(elem).data("animComplete").then(doSomething) to
[12:09:36] <Whirl3d> subscribe to that event.

[12:10:25] <Whirl3d> I have it setup for start and complete, but I would like to offer the same subscriber benefits to the step action in $.animate
[12:12:35] <Whirl3d> reading http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/   now
[12:13:25] <shoky> maybe you can leverage the deferred's progress callbacks for that?
[12:13:56] <PilotBob> Can anyone postulate when my datepicker divs are not positioned correctly? http://screencast.com/t/LFTsjI8yn0a
[12:14:08] <PilotBob> why not when... ;)
[12:14:37] <Whirl3d> shoky, I need to look into that more. I never quite understood how a single state object could have a progress, but I just need to dig deeper I suppose.
[12:14:59] <termite> smoke, try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/U2WQa/
[12:15:00] <Aquilas> Hey guys if someone could tell me why this simple, tiny script won't work I would heavily appreciate it. It works for hover but I want it for clicking
[12:15:02] <Aquilas> http://pastebin.com/M0X37APD
[12:17:25] <termite> smyke, the problems with cells is that they can contain elements that will trigger on on mouse out events inside the cell
[12:17:26] <amaroks> whats the function like php isset() in jquery?
[12:18:06] <mac9416> Okay, y'all, I'm trying to have multiple Cycles in one page. The HTML in this paste should do it, but only one Cycle shows up: http://slexy.org/view/s2Ccl2Qoyp
[12:18:13] <termite> !== undefined
[12:19:01] <mac9416> You should be able to save that as an HTML page and everything work. The images are online, not local.
[12:19:56] <smykes> termite im using the whole cell
[12:19:57] <mac9416> FYI, the elements' IDs are based on the user-defined name. That's to keep the cycles separate.
[12:20:19] <termite> smokes so you don't have anything in the cell but text
[12:20:20] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys, how do I select a text box, trim it, then replace the contents of that text box with the trimmed value?
[12:20:26] <aclockworkpeter> please help, this is driving me crazy
[12:20:59] <termite> smykes, so you only have text in the cell
[12:21:13] <Ox41> So, I cant figure out why javascript:alert(document.location); keeps throwing a 'document not defined' error in firefox :(
[12:21:18] <Ox41> from the address bar
[12:21:27] <Less_Seen> aclockworkpeter make a jsfiddle
[12:22:12] <termite> smokes, I just updated that fiddle
[12:22:27] <ezio> how do i create an element with text and add an event to it beore i append it?
[12:23:14] <termite> smykes, sorry make keep wanting to call you smokes.  that fiddle is updated
[12:24:01] <jjb123> Hey everyone quick question. So I'm fetching a bunch of image urls via AJAX and displaying them on the page, but sometimes they're too big and overflow their container. How can I resize them after I insert them into the page using jquery?
[12:24:46] <Ox41> jjb123: add a css class to the img? maybe/
[12:24:47] <termite> just build the node and do a src=""
[12:25:04] <walidvb_> guys, i still don't manage to call a fct declared in file1.js from file2.js... is there any special way to decare/call the function? could someone give me an example?
[12:25:08] <termite> once it's loaded event fires resize it then attach it
[12:27:36] <jjb123> Ox41: I don't think that will work, the CSS wouldn't take effect because it's being inserted after the page loads
[12:28:28] <termite> create the images element then bind to the loaded event then set the src to the url
[12:28:57] <termite> when the loaded fires resize the image and attach it to the DOM
[12:29:28] <marco> Hello people, gotta little problem and found the solution but can't implement it... Dunno why I can't put 2 different jquery versions at the same time. The whole site is running on 1.5.1 but I also need 1.3.1 Any help? Thanks in advance
[12:29:40] <jjb123> termiite: Hum, I'll try that
[12:30:09] <smykes> termite link?
[12:30:10] <smykes> sorry
[12:30:29] <termite> smykes, http://jsfiddle.net/U2WQa/3/
[12:31:27] <termite> marco, why do you need 1.3.1
[12:32:05] <marco> trying to put this: http://sandbox.sebnitu.com/jquery/quovolver/
[12:32:52] <marco> i know there's the no.Conflict(), but not working
[12:33:25] <termite> haha that was my first thought
[12:33:37] <termite> and it will work in 1.3.1 but not 1.5?
[12:33:44] <Whirl3d> isn't $.queue basically just $.Callbacks applied to the jquery animation queue?
[12:33:57] <marco> yeah pretty weird
[12:35:17] <ezio> omg this weekend is going to be amazing
[12:35:21] <ezio> long weekend
[12:35:24] <ezio> my birthday
[12:35:29] <ezio> tomorrow going to see big wreck
[12:35:32] <termite> marco, if you can dive into their code and see if you can fix it it's allot better then having two versions of jquery
[12:35:39] <ezio> and when i get home my gf will be back
[12:36:11] <ezio> termite, allot means to designate a resource to or for something
[12:36:20] <ezio> a lot
[12:36:23] <ezio> is what you want
[12:37:54] <marco> I'm not sure, will see what I can do. I might just use another plugin.
[12:38:08] <ezio> oh shit this is the jquery room
[12:38:24] <termite> haha yeah I guess
[12:39:28] <marco> that's the disadvantage when someone dunno javascript. currently learning and can't wait to work with it and create my own plugins if possible in the future
[12:41:05] <marco> I could do it with css3
[12:43:16] <velcrobots> anyone have any idea why this page works just fine in Firefox and Safari, but not Chrome or IE? http://www.bjtonline.com/lists
[12:44:09] <NoiseEee> "works just fine"?  what does that mean?  what isn't working in IE or Chrome? velcrobots
[12:47:12] <velcrobots> sorry - well i have the lower half of the collage in a DIV called "lower" that i hide and then show with jquery.  that seems to be showing by default in chrome and IE
[12:47:30] <velcrobots> if you look at it in firefox, then in chrome, it'll be pretty apparent
[12:48:42] <NoiseEee> velcrobots: seems to be working for me equally in ff/chrome
[12:49:22] <velcrobots> really.  on a mac or pc?
[12:49:36] <NoiseEee> linux
[12:49:44] <velcrobots> lol ok
[12:49:53] <ezio> how do you declare static variables in a plugin?
[12:49:54] <rroelofs> linux +1 :-)
[12:50:09] <NoiseEee> anyways, i can see the css is set to display:none so all browsers should be respecting that velcrobots
[12:50:37] <velcrobots> weird.
[12:50:56] <rroelofs> velcrobots: have you done a power refresh recently
[12:51:01] <rroelofs> ?
[12:51:08] <velcrobots> whats that
[12:51:54] <rroelofs> hold down a modifier key (platform dependent) while you click refresh.  it forces the browser to throw away all the old copies and refetch new ones
[12:53:39] <wkmanire> power refresh
[12:53:42] <wkmanire> he he he
[12:53:58] * Less_Seen holds the power button for 30 seconds

I'm using prepend and append to add the tag and the closing tag (lines 27 & 28). now I need to figure out how to get the file name added to the a tag. I suppose i need to use a var of some sort, but not sure how to do it.  here is my code: http://pa

[13:14:13] <ezio> how can i create a static variable in my plugin?
[13:14:39] <mappum> there are no true static variables in JS
[13:14:41] <thomasmyrman> kappaluppa: your link was cut off

[13:22:28] <andr0id1> how to pass a php var to the class: label and send it to the form?
[13:22:36] <wunz> sure
[13:23:45] <Whirl3d> does .next() work in the context of the jquery collection or just in the dom? $(elements).eq(0).next()   would that give $(elements).eq(1) or would that give the next sibling of the first element?
[13:23:59] <andr0id1> how to get the values from the elements and just pass them to a php script?
[13:24:00] <wunz> woulda been nice to color syntax ;p
[13:24:09] <andr0id1> sorry
[13:24:15] <wunz> its ok
[13:24:18] <wunz> pasting to notepad++ now
[13:24:20] <sanjayb> Whirl3d: I *think* next sibling of the first element, but best way to find out ......
[13:24:39] <andr0id1> do you want me to give you a page with working demo?
[13:24:46] <wunz> nah
[13:24:50] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: if only you could test that somehow!!!
[13:25:25] <andr0id1> ok, cause in my script, i get some fields from the db and list them over there, so i want the label to correspond with one of the php vars
[13:25:28] <andr0id1> so i can send it
[13:25:43] <Whirl3d> NoiseEee, thanks for the smart ass comment. I was working on a fiddle. If you were as helpful as your are catty, I wouldn't have to.
[13:26:02] <wunz> which element do you want to send to the php?
[13:26:11] <andr0id1> label, quantity
[13:26:30] <andr0id1> i want to associate the label with something i get from db,
[13:26:40] <andr0id1> i mean a php variable
[13:26:49] <andr0id1> eg: $row['name'];
[13:28:03] <Whirl3d> and another thing, NoiseEee, there's a real benefit to asking somehting like that in this room. Often, I find that more than the answer to a question, I am looking or a discussion. Perhaps there's a better way to get the next element in a jquery collection? Maybe a plugin exists? Is it too much to ask?
[13:28:31] <wunz> well you have all the elements already, all you have to do is do a post to your php script
[13:28:57] <wunz> once you do a post, in your php script, you can get the values from $_POST
[13:29:25] <NoiseEee> Whirl3d: no, i can appreciate that, but the actual question you asked is something that can be immediately tested, by you... and personally i find questions like those contribute to the noise of the channel
[13:29:25] <andr0id1> well how to post them? i just need the quantity and label, and also associate label with name from the db, and quantity with quantity
[13:29:44] <slayerx_x> man! pick a book!
[13:30:03] <amaroks> any better function than change() ? something that works after finishing typing instead of running on each letter typed in input?
[13:30:25] <Famic> amaroks: try blur()
[13:30:34] <andr0id1> wunz?
[13:30:39] <wunz> andr0id1: what you want to do is create some hidden input
[13:30:52] <wunz> set the valye of those hidden inputs to the element values
[13:31:03] <slayerx_x> and pickup a book!~
[13:31:03] <wunz> wrap the hidden input around a <form>
[13:31:31] <wunz> and of course the action="yourphpscript.php" mothod="post"
[13:31:47] <wunz> so then in yourphpscript.php - you can read those variables
[13:32:01] <wunz> understand?
[13:32:03] <andr0id1> yes
[13:32:17] <bartmax_> is there a 'safe' way to use responseText of an xhr as a json return object ? eval just does not feel right
[13:32:31] <wunz> do you know how to get thso vars from within the phpscript?
[13:32:33] <Dodfr> hi
[13:33:03] <wunz> its as simple as $_POST["label"] $_[
[13:33:11] <sandwiches> I need to call a function when all the "side-effects" of another function are completed.  Is deferred objects the best way to approach this?
[13:33:21] <wunz> its as simple as $_POST["label"] $_POST["quantity"]
[13:33:33] <sandwiches> the side-effects are animations.  Basically I want to call three functions in a row, but each function involves queueing animations.
[13:33:41] <wunz> if you need further help, i'm around for another 15 mins or so, then im leaving this office
[13:33:44] <wunz> ;p
[13:33:58] <andr0id1> i know that, the php is not a problem, but passing the label and quantity to php vars is the part i dont understand
[13:34:04] <Dodfr> $_REQUEST if also good as it contains $_GET and $_POST
[13:34:04] <ravenzz> andr0id1 remember to validate/sanitize that values
[13:34:39] <wunz> you still don't understand after i explained it to you?
[13:34:49] <andr0id1> wait
[13:34:56] <ravenzz> ?submit @ andr0id1
[13:34:56] <bot-t> andr0id1, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[13:35:04] <ravenzz> ?post @ andr0id1
[13:35:04] <bot-t> andr0id1, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[13:35:06] <ravenzz> that's it
[13:35:16] <PilotBob> Can anyone postulate why my datepicker divs are not positioned correctly? http://screencast.com/t/LFTsjI8yn0a
[13:35:22] <andr0id1> now its much clearer :D
[13:35:52] <Dodfr> I have a jquery / ajax .js load script problem, whenever I do a non cached .ajax load of a .js (the one that add timestamp to url to make it unique and so non cachable), the loaded .js is still the same.
[13:36:42] <ravenzz> Dodfr how do you ask the server for non-cached content?
[13:37:20] <ravenzz> I mean do you append the timestamp to the request query string?
[13:37:55] <Dodfr> "cache: false" and I also tcpdump and saw that jquery correctly added a "?_=12334455565" timestamp at the end of called URL
[13:38:33] <bartmax_> is there a 'safe' way to use responseText of an xhr as a json return object ? eval just does not feel right
[13:38:34] <ravenzz> oh damn I was expecting a Yes :p
[13:39:36] <Dodfr> but I checked the response content (chrome developer's tool mode) and the .js loaded is the last one up-to-date
[13:39:53] <Dodfr> that is the weird part
[13:40:09] <ravenzz> Dodfr is the dataType setted to "script" ?
[13:40:23] <Dodfr> yes and also tried html just in case of
[13:40:38] <Dodfr> I also tried .getSCript (in fact was the first one I tried)
[13:40:42] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: most browsers should provide a JSON.parse() function, or see http://www.json.org/js.html
[13:41:08] <ravenzz> uhm weird
[13:41:18] <innociv> There is nothing wrong with {'foo':foo, 'bar':bar} versus {foo:foo, bar:bar} is there?
[13:41:28] <bartmax_> ty NoiseEee
[13:41:29] <Dodfr> this is weird, I don't understand why the correct .js content is loaded but is it the old one that is used, also tried with IE and FF in case of
[13:41:53] <bartmax_> NoiseEee jquery doesn't have a $.jsonparse ?
[13:42:10] <krz> Anyone used http://jqvmap.com/ before?  Is there way to dynamically add dots (or some kind of marker) to the map?
[13:42:12] <bartmax_> 	yea found it. thanks
[13:42:21] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: you can just tell the xhr call you're expecting JSON
[13:42:57] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: even better, send back proper headers on the response and it should automagically treat the response as JSON
[13:43:04] <easytiger> how can i print out in the alert() here which form caused the event? http://jsfiddle.net/CVK8n/2/
[13:43:16] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: i see, what are the request header i should send ?
[13:43:23] <bartmax_> response sorry
[13:44:06] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: something with Content-type: application/json should work
[13:44:15] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: ty
[13:44:24] <bartmax_> it's actually returning that already
[13:44:48] <NoiseEee> and you're finding you need to eval the response to use it, bartmax_??
[13:44:53] <ravenzz> Dodfr if you have the new one, you could probably have an instance of the old one and your script doesn't handle such situation
[13:45:18] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: try $.ajax({dataType:'json', etc}); then
[13:45:27] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: aparently... im using ajax form + multipart, the return is from MVC doing Json(object) which returns a json object with proper header.
[13:45:41] <Dodfr> @ravenzz that is what I also think but how to free previous instance ?
[13:45:41] <ravenzz> but mine could be just a silly assumption, I don't know what your code does actually
[13:45:57] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: .. mmm weird, responseText is still a string
[13:46:10] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: json is a string!
[13:46:21] <ravenzz> Dodfr try to create a new instance?
[13:46:28] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: but i need to use it as a JS Object
[13:46:34] <bartmax_> or something, it should be an array
[13:46:45] <ravenzz> I don't know since I haven't seen the code
[13:46:50] <Dodfr> ravenzz : how ?
[13:46:56] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: pastebin your XHR call
[13:46:59] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: response = "["634728735640771484.jpg","634728735641845703.jpg"]"
[13:47:02] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: ok
[13:47:25] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/x9qPxqee
[13:47:53] <Dodfr> I also tried do load script as DIV sub element and add a .clear before the load but same result
[13:48:48] <NoReGreT> is there a way to remove all css styling from an element ?
[13:48:51] <ravenzz> dunno I have to go and I haven't see your code yet :p
[13:49:06] <easytiger> how do you use option:selected to print out both the form name and the selected item here: http://jsfiddle.net/CVK8n/2/
[13:49:15] <ravenzz> if you can paste it someone will able to help you maybe
[13:50:46] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: don't .responseText the xhr... try logging xhr and see what it is
[13:50:54] <Dodfr> will try to fiddle as sample that can reproduce the problem
[13:50:58] <bartmax_> it's a xhr object... NoiseEee
[13:51:17] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: doing it in line:                     console.log('upload done', xhr);
[13:51:47] <bartmax_> and responseText is a string.
[13:53:56] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: parseJSON works... but I would love to get it automaggically converted...
[13:54:14] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: then i would think something funky is going on with your ajaxForm() method
[13:55:00] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: do u know ajax form plugin?
[13:55:03] <NoiseEee> a natural $.ajax() call with {dataType:'json'} will do it
[13:55:05] <NoiseEee> bartmax_: nope
[13:55:18] <bartmax_> NoiseEee: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#file-upload should support this very nativelly
[13:55:42] <NoiseEee> i cant speak for plugins, sorry :)
[13:55:47] <ajpiano> bartmax_: you can use dataType:"json" as NoiseEee said
[13:55:56] <bartmax_> ajpiano: im using it...
[13:56:01] <ajpiano> but that won't actually change it so xhr.responseText is ever itself already an object
[13:56:02] <bartmax_> ajpiano: still response is string :S
[13:56:06] <ajpiano> and it wouldn't make sense to
[13:56:18] <ajpiano> it makes it so whatever it hands back in success is parsed as json and an object
[13:56:26] <ajpiano> but it doesn't change the property on the xhr itself
[13:56:30] <ajpiano> wouldn't reall ymake sense to do that
[13:56:34] <ajpiano> holy god why i am still on irc
[13:56:45] <tw2113> because you love us
[13:56:46] <bartmax_> ajpiano: because you care about us (?) :D
[13:57:02] <ajpiano> haha perhaps
[13:57:09] <ajpiano> i have to shower and get on a train  though omz
[13:57:17] <bartmax_> ajpiano: ok, so xhr isn't changed... how do i access to the object response thing tho ?
[13:57:28] <ajpiano> bartmax_: the argument in succeess should be json
[13:57:33] <ajpiano> sorry mate gotta go now though
[13:57:41] <bartmax_> ajpiano: ok, go! i will try success handler
[13:57:42] <bartmax_> thanks!
[13:58:57] <bartmax_> ajpiano: IS the man...
[13:59:08] <bartmax_> on success handler is actually a json
[13:59:11] <hlveheart> He's my favorite jquery wizard
[13:59:17] * hlveheart slaps ajpiano around a bit with a large trout
[13:59:32] <oojacoboo> mmm trout
[14:00:02] <easytiger> how do you use option:selected to print out both the form name and selected value? http://jsfiddle.net/CVK8n/2/
[14:00:12] <ryanneufeld> ?ajpiano
[14:00:12] <bot-t> IS the man...
[14:00:17] <hlveheart> lol
[14:03:10] <bartmax_> he doesn't call himself Adam j.sontag in vain... that's for sure
[14:03:39] <bartmax_> what chances are you called j.sontag and be a fucking javascript expert ? :)
[14:03:59] <ajpiano> lol
[14:04:05] <ajpiano> <json></json>
[14:04:10] <bartmax_> exactly!
[14:04:23] * bartmax_ watches clock thinking : train is leaving ...
[14:07:27] <easytiger> can you get the form and value for each selected item in a .change : http://jsfiddle.net/CVK8n/2/

[14:16:51] <norkakn> Hi.  I have a structure/style question.  I'm creating a jquery-ui plugin to display trees.  I have things like nodes and edges to keep track of, that have their own complex object information.  Is there a good example of how to cleanly represent what would be classes within a module in python?  Should I declare an internal namespace kind of like how crockford does it for YUI stuff?
[14:17:12] <easytiger> Ox41: thats good, but what about the form it came from?
[14:21:58] <sanjayb> norkakn: i recently wrote some code that required something like this, if you want to see, not sure if its best practice or anything: http://code.camputer.org/jquery.pandoravideo.js/annotate/head%3A/jquery.pandoravideo.js
[14:22:18] <norkakn> sanjayb, thanks, I'll check it out
[14:22:34] <sanjayb> norkakn: im always a bit confused when it comes to writing a class in JS, but some-how go with what comes naturally and its generally okay .. there's just so many subtle different ways to do it
[14:22:45] <sanjayb> norkakn: look for the PandoraVideo "class" in there
[14:24:28] <norkakn> sanjayb, why did you put it outside of the closure of the widget?
[14:25:24] <sanjayb> norkakn: good question - its wrapped inside of the outer (function() so namespaced internally .. hmmm .. maybe it is better inside the widget closure ;) - just thought it cleaner / neater outside of it.
[14:26:00] <sanjayb> norkakn: and you'll see at the bottom i define a couple more $.fn. things ..
[14:26:02] <norkakn> sanjayb, Okay, I was just wondering, as that is one of the things that I was debating.  I think I'll copy a lot of your style though.  Thanks!
[14:26:26] <sanjayb> norkakn: (code is a bit hackish / in progress, but yea, thought it turned out kindof okay)
[14:27:17] <sanjayb> norkakn: there's a couple things im doing definitely wrong like not doing the return this.each stuff for jquery plugins - was a bit rusty :/
[14:27:48] <oojacoboo> anyone using jquery and coffeescript?
[14:28:24] <norkakn> sanjayb, It's still pretty solid code, especially compared to most of the legacy stuff that i have to replace
[14:28:38] <oojacoboo> I find coffeescript interesting, but don't see a ton of value really
[14:28:52] <Klevre> I can't seem to hook the change() event on to selectors with wildcards
[14:29:08] <sanjayb> norkakn: heh - this was some-how an inspired night a couple weeks ago. i need a night like that again soon :/
[14:29:14] <oojacoboo> Klevre, that sounds like a bad idea anyway
[14:29:21] <Klevre> the wildcard selector matches the wanted elements on testing via console
[14:29:35] <Klevre> oojacoboo, well it's the only way I can think of achieving what I need
[14:29:50] <oojacoboo> Klevre, you have a sample of the DOM?
[14:30:18] <Klevre> would take a while to strip away all the rest of the code, but I have a live version of the site if you're willing to see that
[14:30:27] <oojacoboo> sure
[14:31:42] <bzitzow> Hi. How can I add a custom event to the JQuery DatePicker?  http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker
[14:39:20] <ScrotusMaximus90> Hey all, how's my jquery friends doin
[14:41:31] <derrida> If I have an accordion list, is the entire accordion loaded (and then parts hidden from view) or is the loading of each section happening when i expand it?
[14:41:45] <derrida> accordion from jqueryui that is, sorry.
[14:42:29] <ScrotusMaximus90> Who do you guys use for web hosting?
[14:42:55] <gehsekky> derrida: unless you're using the changestart handler to dynamically load content, it's all loaded first with parts hidden
[14:43:31] <derrida> ScrotusMaximus90: i use linode and love them
[14:43:42] <gehsekky> i've heard really good things about linode
[14:43:44] <derrida> gehsekky: hmm, cool, i'll read about that. thank you.
[14:44:12] <gehsekky> i might go over to linode when i give up hostgator
[14:44:49] <ScrotusMaximus90> hostgator? shudder
[14:44:55] <ScrotusMaximus90> FMFL I have had so many problems with them
[14:48:29] <derrida> gehsekky: they're a fantastic vps, i've used them for about 4 years now and it just gets beter and better. not something i find myself saying about many products! :P
[14:48:40] <derrida> linode, that is.

[14:50:03] <rudiX> is there any function that can display error
[14:50:25] <rudiX> because .ondone outputs nothing

[14:51:51] <rudiX> andr0id1: bacause we didnt have one :)
[14:52:01] <shoky> umm i dono,  $.getJSON('url').done(...).fail(...)
[14:52:51] <andr0id1> exactly. wake up, brush your teeth, see yourself in the mirror, you see bearded and hairy creature that every next day is kinda stranger

[14:54:00] * shoky eats ice cream
[14:54:24] <andr0id1> yeah, and spots on your shirt from eating pizza or whatever you found in the fridge, and now its all gone
[14:54:26] <rudiX> andr0id1: no regrets man ... its "bitch syndrome"
[14:54:35] <Madrid1980> hi can anyone please help. I've got jcarousel installed and I just want a very simple way to show a tooltip on each item when hovered over... I thought there would be a plugin or something but after searching around it seems to be a nightmare, lots of posts about it not working and no tutorials to set it up... does anyone know how i can please do this? thanks for any help at all.
[14:54:59] <andr0id1> bitch-syndrome?
[14:54:59] <rudiX> like girls are always - I dont wanna miss that ... but the thing she could miss is not interesting at all
[14:55:17] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: hm. do you have a code sample somewhere .. ?
[14:55:28] <andr0id1> yeah, and it pisses you off for no reason
[14:55:29] <tw2113> shoky you're in here pretty much all day right? :)
[14:55:32] <andr0id1> girls are strange
[14:55:34] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: /me thinks .. maybe an interesting problem.
[14:55:40] <rajkosto> hey
[14:55:43] <shoky> tw2113 if you say so ;P
[14:55:54] <tw2113> permission to PM quick
[14:55:59] <rajkosto> i have some "text" and i want to treat that text like DOM, and remove the outermost wrapper
[14:56:02] <shoky> i think i slept 14 hours
[14:56:07] <shoky> me? shure
[14:56:20] <Madrid1980> hi thanks guys, my site is here: http://www.eborselfpublishing.co.uk/
[14:56:57] <Madrid1980> it's such a simple little carousel, only a couple of items and i just want a float over tooltip to pop up at the side or a box i can put a description and a link in
[14:57:09] <rudiX> andr0id1: are you devving mobile *hits :)
[14:58:03] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: it would be simple if you had another static div somewhere on the page that just got the description text or so
[14:58:12] <sanjayb> oh - and if you want a link in that, it can't be a "tooltip"
[14:58:24] <sanjayb> since then if you hover out, it disappears. and you can't click on the link - AAAAAAAA
[14:59:40] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: ah, I just thought I'd be able to add a title to the li i already have and paste a plugin in there somewhere, but there doesn't seem to be anything that works already... yeah even without the link would be fine
[15:00:52] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: well, yea, patching together plugins may not work in this case
[15:00:56] <rudiX> shoky: thanks for the .fail function
[15:01:08] <rudiX> still cannot understand whats wrong
[15:01:13] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: I'd add a title to the <li> or the <a>, yes .. or just a data- attribute
[15:01:30] <sanjayb> rudiX: cross-domain can be weird - what do you see in the Network Requests in firebug?
[15:01:51] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: if I add a title to the li, what can i then use to show the tooltip?
[15:02:08] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: er, some code :)
[15:02:09] <rudiX> sanjayb: no request at all
[15:03:17] <rudiX> thats why I needed way to display error
[15:03:33] <rudiX> now .fail outputs big Json i cannot understand :)
[15:04:09] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: sorry, so where do i add the jquery code, to my carousel.js file?
[15:04:24] <rajkosto> how do i know if a selector returns an element ?
[15:04:33] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: erm - I wrote some simple pseudo-code that's the basic idea of what you want: http://dpaste.com/749563/
[15:05:12] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: but i'd really suggest trying to understand it / read up a bit, etc.
[15:05:53] <sanjayb> rajkosto: if ($('.foo').length > 1)
[15:06:22] <sanjayb> rajkosto: er, if ($('.foo').length > 0) i.e.
[15:10:00] <tommyent_> How can I trigger this from an on click inside an iFrame? http://pastebin.com/xwrLrrNN
[15:12:42] <andr0id1> i am craving for pizza
[15:12:44] <sanjayb> tommyent_: if you're trying to trigger an event on the parent page from a click inside the iframe, the general answer is "you can't"
[15:13:17] <sanjayb> tommyent_: sorry i can't view that paste because goddamnit pastebin.com is blocked by my isp and i'm too lazy to use a proxy right now.
[15:14:01] <CAPITANO> Ciao amici di #jquery !!
[15:14:09] <sanjayb> tommyent_: do you control the page inside the iframe / is it on the same domain?
[15:14:14] <tommyent_> sanjayb: Yes
[15:14:43] <sanjayb> tommyent_: ah, okay, then there is ways - uh, can you paste to dpaste.com or so (sorry, this is silly) ?
[15:14:53] <tommyent_> sanova: I can paste somewhere else if that helps. I can close color box with onclick="parent.$.colorbox.close()"
[15:14:56] <tommyent_> Yeah
[15:15:33] <tommyent_> sanjayb: http://dpaste.com/749567/
[15:17:01] <sanjayb> tommyent_: uh, i dont see that in the paste?
[15:17:35] <tommyent_> sanjayb: colorbox ?
[15:17:43] <andr0id1> i am craving for pizza, anyone wants some?
[15:18:16] <sanjayb> tommyent_: yea, on http://dpaste.com/749567/ ? the code just seems to be fading out page and redirecting when clicking on some links?
[15:18:54] <brianfreud> $.get('pizza')
[15:19:43] <tommyent_> sanjayb: Yeah the color box was for another part and I did get that to work from the iframe but I can't for the life of me get the page to fadeout and redirect from inside the iframe
[15:21:19] <sanjayb> tommyent_: oh, this code is being run inside the iframe ... ? and you want the parent page to fade out and change window.location ? or the page that the iframe is in?
[15:21:28] <sanjayb> err, i mean, the page that is in the iframe
[15:21:47] <Madrid1980> hi can anyone please help. I've tried to combine Cluetip (tooltips) with jcarousel on the same page. They seem to conflict and one breaks the other, does anyone know how I can get them working together please? here's the page: http://www.eborselfpublishing.co.uk/
[15:22:30] <Madrid1980> the tooltips are on the text links under "We can" and the vertical jacarousel should be in the right column but it just shows bullet points since adding the tooltips/cluetips...
[15:23:12] <tommyent_> sanjayb  parent page. It's an form inside the iframe and when submitted I would like color box to close and the page to redirect. The page in the parent window.
[15:23:18] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: hi again, I've added what i could be am stuck again... I don't get why one is stopping the other?
[15:24:13] <sanjayb> tommyent_: ah, i see what you mean .. window.parent.location = linkLocation does not work ?
[15:25:32] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: well, right now on the page I get an error saying no method .jcarousel() .. which does not look good :/
[15:26:04] <tommyent_> sanjayb: no but I will try it again.
[15:26:24] <ohman> hi
[15:26:32] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: but the jcarousel works fine if i remove the tooltips code from my head content and also the page. then it's working great and scrolling...
[15:26:50] <z0ned> what's the php channel?
[15:26:55] <ohman> when i load a div using $.post() data my jquery validators dont show the red text
[15:27:02] <ohman> on a validation failure
[15:27:06] <ohman> but still blocks and validate
[15:27:09] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: uh - you're including jquery twice on the page
[15:27:11] <ohman> does anyone know why?
[15:27:25] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: make sure you include jquery just once and try
[15:28:39] <andr0id1> i have a headache
[15:28:49] <Madrid1980> sanjayb: i tried removing jquery.js and then the jcarousel works but the tooltips don't, then i put that back and remove the jquery-1.2.3.pack.js and the tooltips work and not the carousel...
[15:29:51] <sanjayb> tommyent_: aah! refer http://www.av5.com/docs/changing-parent-window-s-url-from-iframe-content.html
[15:31:14] <jstout24> if i'm using $.load()â€¦ what's the right way to execute javascript in remotely loaded html
[15:31:37] <burrito_> is the last part of jquery-1.7.2.min.js supposed to be commented out?
[15:31:42] <sanjayb> Madrid1980: try with just jquery.js and see what errors you get in the console
[15:31:55] <tommyent_> sanjayb: sweet going to try this thanks
[15:32:34] <sanjayb> jstout24: not sure about "right", but i just stick it in a <script></script> tag at the bottom of that html
[15:33:14] <sanjayb> jstout24: works in all browsers i tried
[15:35:44] <jstout24> sanjayb, which method are you using?
[15:35:52] <jstout24> for some reason, doing $.load() works, but doing $.get() doesn't
[15:36:25] <sanjayb> jstout24: uh? I do a get(), i get my html, including the <script></script> at the bottom, insert it on the page, and the scripts execute.
[15:36:38] <jstout24> hmm
[15:36:46] <jstout24> i can get an alert() to work using both methods
[15:36:49] <sanjayb> jstout24: sorry, don't see how this has to do with how one gets the html (via ajax or any other method)
[15:37:06] <sanjayb> jstout24: don't put the code inside $(document).ready() or anything as that never fires
[15:37:13] <jstout24> but trying to initialize something like uploadify or an html5 upload, it doesn't rebind it when refreshing the element
[15:37:37] <sanjayb> jstout24: and if you want the code to reference html elements that are on that page, stick the js at the bottom so its run after those elements exist in the DOM
[15:38:02] <sanjayb> jstout24: hm. have an example up somewhere / errors in console ?
[15:38:11] <jstout24> it's so hard, lol
[15:38:12] <jstout24> let me see
[15:40:52] <jstout24> https://gist.github.com/05742d5674f3bcfdd5db
[15:42:58] <jstout24> oh and sanjayb, on my Dialog.refresh method, if I do `$dialog.find('div.ui-dialog-content div.dialog-content').load($dialog.attr('data-content-url')); return;` before my ajax call, it works
[15:45:26] <jstout24> oh and no errors
[15:46:24] <sanjayb> jstout24, console.log(responseText) shows you what you'd expect ?
[15:46:55] <jstout24> sanjayb, i think i'm narrowing it down
[15:47:00] <sanjayb> jstout24: Inspect Element on $dialogContent after shows the content properly inserted?
[15:47:13] <jstout24> if i don't create a temp div and inject the responseText directly
[15:47:13] <jstout24> it works
[15:47:25] <sanjayb> jstout24: ah, i see
[15:47:39] <jstout24> but i need to be able to select an element if it exists in responseText, otherwise, inject the whole response
[15:48:14] <sanjayb> but that element, does it also contain the JS to be executed ?
[15:48:25] <jstout24> i better hope so
[15:49:23] <sanjayb> jstout24: lol. ok. try doing something like - $temp.find('div.dialog-content').html() <-- insert the .html() instead of the actual DOM element
[15:49:50] <jstout24> houston i found my problem
[15:49:57] <jstout24> yeah the script tag isn't there on the selectâ€¦ weirrrd
[15:50:10] <jstout24> probably a magical closing tag somewhere
[15:50:24] <jstout24> sanjayb, i took what i have directly from jquery's load function :P
[15:50:36] <jstout24> i was doing .html(), but .load() doesn't for some reason
[15:50:40] <jstout24> so i thought, OMG IM WRONG
[15:51:09] <sanjayb> jstout24: :)
[15:53:31] <jstout24> sanjayb, i wonder if jquery removes script tags after embedding it in an element then selecting that element?
[15:54:56] <sanjayb> jstout24: seems like some nonsense like that .. if you convert the html to a jquery object, it will convert it to a dom node .. not sure what happens then .. just injecting the html string into the document with innerHTML or .html has worked for me fine.
[15:57:07] <TC_> Small issue but ... confusing as heck. http://pastebin.com/uA6UEKfG I'm receiving this in my console when I make an ajax call.
[15:57:13] <TC_> it doesn't happen all the time, but 99% of the time it does.
[15:57:41] <TC_> Any idea how I can further debug this? I'm not sure if it's the JS or the PHP causing it.. I mean the PHP script has no parse errors unless I have something groovey going on
[16:07:06] <jstout24> sanjayb, http://jsfiddle.net/HWXdB/
[16:13:19] <Whirl3d> could someone please look at this really simple code and tell my why I am getting an error? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dUXGy/1/
[16:14:08] <Whirl3d> wow. nvm   c=c-- didn't work
[16:14:08] <bakers> How do I create a js regpex object with a variable in it? var re = /my_var/i;
[16:14:18] <bakers> where my_var is some thing I supplied earlier
[16:14:29] <eliseumds> using RegExp object constructor
[16:14:48] <shoky> lol @ c = c--
[16:14:51] <bakers> eliseumds: var re = new RegExp(my_var,'i')
[16:14:52] <bakers> ?
[16:15:06] <eliseumds> yep
[16:15:22] <TC_> I've got a strong problem. I make an ajax call and I've echo'd out all parts of the string and I now believe the issue lays inside the ajax call POST data.
[16:15:50] <bluesmoon> this line looks like a problem:  c = c--;
[16:15:52] <sunbeam> whats in jquery the mouseover called again?
[16:15:57] <TC_> Whenever ?? is entered into the post data using the format as data: "string=??" it will turn out like this: jQuery172015566541254520416_1337296267704
[16:16:02] <TC_> any idea why this is happening?
[16:16:58] <shoky> sunbeam: hover?
[16:17:19] <sunbeam> shoky: yes
[16:17:33] <sunbeam> shoky: also need to test when mouse is outside
[16:17:36] <jstout24> ping sanjayb
[16:17:49] <shoky> sunbeam: yes, hover
[16:19:18] <Whirl3d> anbody familiar with the Galleria plugin or know of a good gallery that accepts JSON data ? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/dUXGy/3/
[16:19:45] <Whirl3d> I'm just really sick of writing my own...it's taking too long and too much of a pain in the arse to get it to do what I want.
[16:20:14] <sunbeam> shoky: its for drop down menu
[16:20:33] <shoky> sunbeam: kk
[16:21:06] <TC_> Is what I mentioned a possible bug?
[16:21:45] <shoky> TC_: i didnt understand your issue
[16:22:08] <sanjayb> jstout24: pong
[16:22:18] <sanjayb> jstout24: try using .html() instead of .append() .. does that work?
[16:22:38] <jstout24> tried that :(
[16:23:10] <sunbeam> shoky: can i send small pm with 1 link? i implemented this in a site but i dont know how come it dont work well
[16:23:38] <shoky> a jsfiddle would be better
[16:23:51] <sanjayb> jstout24: uh-oh ..
[16:24:02] <jstout24> haha what
[16:24:22] <jstout24> sanjayb, http://jsfiddle.net/HWXdB/3/ this works but not sure how well
[16:25:14] <sanjayb> jstout24: ah, wait, of course
[16:25:31] <jstout24> ?
[16:26:21] <sanjayb> jstout24: it does execute the JS tho
[16:26:52] <sanjayb> jstout24: just doesn't keep it around in the DOM .. because it wouldn't be a valid dom or so
[16:28:20] <jstout24> sanjayb, innerHTML doesn't seem to execute it
[16:28:24] <sanjayb> jstout24: not sure why you need the <script> in the DOM .. ?
[16:28:25] <jstout24> append() or html() does
[16:28:43] <sanjayb> jstout24: hm, i maybe wrong about innerHTML
[16:28:56] <jstout24> sanjayb, i'm attempting to make something somewhat "BC".. normally i'd have this bit somewhere else
[16:29:32] <sanjayb> jstout24: yea - i was going to say ;) .. so its a bit hackish one way or the other ..
[16:31:18] <TC_> shoky, I don't understand it either. Biascally I have a textarea and when you press enter it'll send the entered message to a text file (through ajax). Works for the most part, however if the user entered ?? (2 question marks), it ends up turning into jQuery172015566541254520416_1337296267705 which looks to me like the final bit is a timestamp. Googling something simmilar came up with no results. I've alerted the message entered in the tex
[16:31:26] <TC_> Am I making myself clear?
[16:31:57] <TC_> If not, then I'll see what I can do to further look into it.
[16:32:07] <sanjayb> TC_, are you sending the data via GET or POST ?
[16:32:30] <TC_> POST
[16:32:34] <TC_> @sanjayb
[16:33:37] <sanjayb> TC_,: try running something like escape() on the string you're sending anyway?
[16:35:01] <TC_> does that encode ?'s
[16:35:11] <TC_> Not sure if that qualifies as a special character.
[16:35:28] <TC_> either way, trying it now.
[16:35:51] <sanjayb> TC_: this seems to give a decent overview of escape options: http://www.javascripter.net/faq/escape.htm
[16:36:07] <Costin> hey, we need help testing a phone number: 213-416-1560, access code is 492-302-232# -- can you guys call in?  it's for testing a conference calling platform.
[16:36:11] <sanjayb> TC_, it does escape ?
[16:36:24] <TC_> sanjayb that worked ... I don't get the issue anymore.
[16:36:32] <sanjayb> TC_: cool.
[16:37:51] <TC_> I do think it's a possible bug, I mean... I don't think ?? should be producing stuff like what I shown before. Strange thing is, it only occurs on the first lot of ?? if you had.. ?? ?? ?? or even ?????? ... it only takes the first 2, replaces it with jQuerynonsense and the rest work as normal... do you have any idea why it may be doing that?
[16:38:51] <sanjayb> TC_: that is totally weird - but until you have a test-case up somewhere, its hard to tell.
[16:41:10] <huglester> guys, do you know of any good howto.. on how to use setInterval()? I want it to finish thep rocess, but I'd like also to add the delay after it finishesh befoce next cycle ...
[16:41:19] <huglester> I somehow can't get threw this
[16:42:02] <sanjayb> huglester: maybe setTimeout is better for your case? do you have code of what you're trying to do?
[16:43:38] <huglester> sanjayb: what I want is ... loop for all images. I want to preaload i image, and after load, I want to wait 2 seconds before fadeIn() new image.. the load next.. wait, fadeIn() again
[16:44:04] <huglester> sanjayb: you think setTimeout() is better here?
[16:44:20] <shoky> it's almost always better
[16:44:29] <huglester> sanjayb: I can try putting the code on jsfiddle to show what I got
[16:44:37] <huglester> hm.. okay:))
[16:45:56] <sunbeam> does anyone know how come that when i use slideUp with a submenu in IE when I move away from the top level link the slide dissapears again?
[16:46:34] <sanjayb> huglester: some pseudo code - lemme know if it makes sense: http://dpaste.com/749595/
[16:47:17] <huglester> sanjayb: not sure yet... I'll try to play with it now :)
[16:47:24] <huglester> sanjayb: thanks a lot
[16:47:55] <huglester> I'm fightingthose setinterval, settimeout all the day.. my head gonna explode :)) I'll soon return with results
[16:48:05] <sanjayb> huglester: lol, best, np.
[16:53:33] <_BigWings_> does anyone know if there is an event handler for when the user drops a link into a textarea?
[16:57:00] <thomasmyrman> I think you'll have to create one
[16:57:03] <TC_> sanjayb managed to duplicate it.. but with an added bonus. A parse error. Let me tell you somemore.
[16:57:36] <sanjayb> TC_: hm
[16:57:38] <TC_> sanjayb it only happens when it's json, and on the spot jquery creates a function such as jQuery17029nonsense to call.
[16:58:04] <TC_> sanjayb it appears the question marks are messing up with the data? or something causing a parse error that doesn't terminate the execution of javascript like they usually do.
[16:58:10] <huglester> sanjayb: I think it works.... http://dpaste.com/749599/ does it look good to you? maybe I have done some mistakes?
[16:58:25] <TC_> sanjayb I checked for errors with the ajax call and this is in my console: message: "jQuery17209301481919828802_1337298978684 was not called"
[16:58:28] <TC_> says enough.
[16:58:37] <TC_> it gets created on the fly for each request, sanjayb
[16:58:56] <sanjayb> TC_: sounds fun, but until you paste some code, its really hard to tell ..
[16:59:32] <sanjayb> huglester: uh, you probably want the setTimeout inside the onload function
[17:00:02] <andr0id1> jquery is awesome!
[17:00:07] <huglester> sanjayb: but I want the script to start preloading image before timeout...?
[17:00:38] <sanjayb> huglester: kindof like this: http://dpaste.com/749600/
[17:00:44] <huglester> sanjayb: what I want is that new image, would be avaialble before fadeIn(), because if image won't be yet loaded.. it will look terrible while fading
[17:01:01] <sanjayb> huglester: but you want it to load one image, THEN wait two seconds, THEN start preloading the next one, right ?
[17:01:40] <huglester> sanjayb: yeah, sounds exacly how I want, let me test your code
[17:02:03] <chovy> is there a way to convert a jquery html object back to an html string?
[17:02:27] <huglester> sanjayb: ah, understood now what you are trying to tell me, thanks a lot!
[17:02:42] <huglester> sanjayb: I got your point. yes your sollution is what I need:)
[17:03:01] <_BigWings_> thomasmyrman: how would I do that?
[17:03:24] <sanjayb> chovy: not sure if you're looking for something like this: http://jquery-howto.blogspot.in/2009/02/how-to-get-full-html-string-including.html
[17:03:31] <thomasmyrman> Check for input, match against http://
[17:04:47] <_BigWings_> huh?
[17:04:51] <TC_> sanjayb: http://pastebin.com/1XvxUGaJ index.html and http://pastebin.com/cq0vAHAw bug.php - only works with json being the datatype. creates a random function on the fly for the request... and something goes on with ?? ... apparent'y it searches for something and replaces it with the function name. however, in my pastes... putting in ? will error but on my chat script I'm working on.. putting in ? is fine .. jsut not ?? which is extremely 
[17:05:12] <_BigWings_>  .bind('paste', function(e)
[17:05:24] <_BigWings_> works if the user presses ctrl-v to paste stuff
[17:05:36] <_BigWings_> but it doesn't work if the user drags an image into a text area
[17:05:54] <_BigWings_> even though the textarea receives the image url
[17:06:18] <sanjayb> _BigWings_: binding to these things is sometimes a pain - does it at least fire .change() ?
[17:07:05] <sanjayb> TC_: that maybe a bug .. goddamn problem is i need to proxy to see pastebin.com :(
[17:07:13] <_BigWings_> no it only fires that when the textarea loses focus
[17:07:18] <sanjayb> TC_: and its 5:30 in the morning and i really should sleep
[17:07:35] <sanjayb> _BigWings_: yea, and this is consistent across browsers ?
[17:07:46] <_BigWings_> don't know
[17:07:51] <_BigWings_> only tested in firefox so far
[17:08:31] <sanjayb> _BigWings_: i'd file a browser bug - if they allow dragging in and modifying a textarea, but fire no event, that's not nice :/
[17:08:59] <TC_> alright sanjayb I'll work on it a bit more then throw up a bug report or something like that. Either way, with what I was using, I do need to escape the characters otherwise it'll see &bleh=something as a new parameter.
[17:09:24] <sanjayb> TC_: right, escaping sounds like a good idea anyway
[17:09:40] <TC_> apparently sanjayb, jquery uses this regex /(\=)\?(&|$)|\?\?/i and replaces it with the function name.
[17:10:06] <sanjayb> TC_: woh
[17:11:01] <sanjayb> _BigWings_: if you find an event that is fired, or a work-around, please do let know.
[17:14:55] <martisj> Is there a way to animate and hide a list item completely?
[17:18:10] <martisj> i was targeting the wrong element
[17:35:10] <sunbeam> anyone can help me, see why my drop down doesn't properly work in IE8/9?
[17:36:33] <dabear> sunbeam: can you help me? my car doesn't work properly on the highways?
[17:37:21] <sunbeam> put your car in jsfiddle pls :)
[17:38:10] <sunbeam> dabear: http://bit.ly/LbWbg9
[17:38:57] <sunbeam> dabear: roll over miss humanity in the menu
[17:39:04] <dabear> nice
[17:39:08] <dabear> fap material
[17:40:30] <sunbeam> i cannot find why IE8/9 do interpret anchors like this
[17:41:55] <dabear> thanks for not minifying the source
[17:41:56] <dabear> ..
[17:42:07] <dabear> sarcasm
[17:43:24] <sunbeam> k
[17:43:34] <dabear> using mouseenter/mouseleave instead of mouseover/mouseout usually solves those kinda problems
[17:43:52] <sunbeam> lets check
[17:44:04] <sunbeam> the issue is more i think that in I8/9 you cannot define height, width for <a>
[17:44:37] <tw2113> is it set to display; block /
[17:44:40] <tw2113> ?
[17:45:34] <sunbeam> sure
[17:46:06] <dabear> mouseenter should work though
[17:46:49] <dabear> oh
[17:46:51] <dabear> and $('#main_navigation li')
[17:47:13] <dabear> matches both the first and second levels of li
[17:47:26] <dabear> probably should be $('#main_navigation>li')
[17:48:01] <sunbeam> that's not the issue already tried that
[17:48:04] <sunbeam> but you're right
[17:48:40] <shoky> ;p
[17:48:42] <dabear> try fixing the selector and use mouseenter/mouseleave
[17:48:51] <dabear> and issue should be solved? :p
[17:49:13] <sunbeam> its solved now :)
[17:49:18] <sunbeam> but it sucks that i couldn't come up with this myself
[17:49:43] <sunbeam> i code/slice this template in 30 mins , but i need 2 hours to fix a simple mouseover issue
[17:49:59] <shoky> changing to mouseenter/mouseleave is what fixed it??
[17:50:25] <sunbeam> no i used a timeout function
[17:50:29] <shoky> ah
[17:50:38] <shoky> cause .hover just uses mouseenter/mouseleave ;p
[17:51:03] <sunbeam> yea that makes sense
[17:58:14] <cordoval> how to store state? or like
[17:58:42] <cordoval>     $(document).on("change", "select.a", function() {
[17:58:44] <cordoval>         var flag = true;
[17:58:46] <cordoval>         if ($(this).attr("value") != "" && flag == true) {
[17:58:48] <cordoval>             flag = false;
[17:59:05] <cordoval> i am having problems with that construct because i want the flag = true to be set once in a lifetime
[17:59:12] <cordoval> so that is why i want to store state, how to?
[18:00:48] <ner0x> What are some popular jquery mouseover textbox plugins?
[18:01:42] <shoky> cordoval: you can store stuff per DOM element with $(this).data(...)
[18:02:24] <droope> Hi guys, I have a problem with some elements that aren't being passed by reference, can you help me? Heres the code, the situation is in //coments
[18:02:27] <droope> http://pastie.org/3928298
[18:03:24] <droope> I really can't get it! ;(
[18:03:36] <droope> it's simple, tshould be working fine
[18:14:06] <droope> anyone? :D
[18:18:12] <anusx4> Need help with deferred.  http://jsfiddle.net/TZAUP/
[18:18:24] <anusx4> I am trying to get those divs to fadeIn in the correct order.
[18:19:25] <anusx4> This stuff is just an abstraction of my real problem, but this will solve my real problem.  I need to call 3 functions in sequence, but each function has animations of varying durations.
[18:19:49] <anusx4> in my jsfiddle there, "two_stepper"  is an example of such a function
[18:20:45] <kappaluppa> I need to replace the image file name (MAIN_1.png) in this function with a file name supplied by a variable http://pastebin.com/Z9ku7Qnt
[18:21:03] <kappaluppa> I think the variable would be src (???)
[18:21:28] <cordoval> shoky: var flag = $(this).attr('class'); // we get all the classes
[18:21:36] <kappaluppa> from line 2. how would I insert that into the html that is being returned?
[18:21:36] <cordoval> how to get only the class that i am interested
[18:21:40] <cordoval> or to check if it exists
[18:21:43] <cordoval> ?
[18:21:46] <anusx4> cordoval: hasClass
[18:22:17] <rajkosto> $("#formId").submit( function(event) { formAjaxPost(event, $( this )); }); is correct, right ?
[18:23:33] <rajkosto> the selector returns 1 element
[18:23:42] <rajkosto> but when i click submit, the normal thing happens instead of mine
[18:25:45] <rajkosto> i changed it to just an alert, still bombs
[18:27:31] <orangey> hello all
[18:28:13] <orangey> I'm trying to find the 'jquery way' of making a variable out of an input's value. Would it be: var x =$('#TradeShiftFromUserId').val() ?
[18:28:18] <orangey> for example?
[18:30:41] <orangey> I guess the question in essence is: what's the jquery equivalent of document.getElementById('TradeShiftFromUserId').value ?
[18:31:58] <droope> orangey: $('#TradeShiftFromUserId').val()
[18:32:11] <devinceartas> $("#TradeShiftFromUsetId").val()
[18:32:34] <orangey> hmm.
[18:32:39] <orangey> not having luck with it for some reason.
[18:32:41] <droope> you can select any CSS selector with jquery $("li.red li:eq(3)")
[18:33:02] <droope> orangey: how many divs with that ID you have on the page? that's a question worth asking with html that's not pretty
[18:33:39] <orangey> I don't have any divs. it's an ID in an input
[18:33:45] <orangey> and I want to pull the value out of the input field
[18:34:03] <orangey> i've also tried input#TradeShiftFromUserId
[18:34:09] <aphid> selector.val()?
[18:34:27] <aphid> oh, scrollback just kicked my ass
[18:34:56] <aphid> where scrollback didn't even involve scrolling :D
[18:35:02] <droope> orangey: try tiping this in your console
[18:35:25] <droope> console.log($("*[id=TradeShiftFromUserId]").length)
[18:35:47] <droope> what does $('#TradeShiftFromUserId').val() return?
[18:35:54] <droope> and $('#TradeShiftFromUserId') ?
[18:37:10] <droope> My bug fixed itself
[18:37:11] <droope> u.u
[18:37:13] <rajkosto> how do i check if selector is form ?
[18:37:39] <droope> $(selector).is('form') :)
[18:37:51] <orangey> aha! working now.
[18:37:58] <orangey> not sure what I changed there
[18:38:06] <orangey> but it appears to work perfectly now. thank you droope
[18:39:50] <rajkosto> droope, how do i get an element's id ?
[18:40:14] <droope> rajkosto: perhaps google it! i don't think i remember :(
[18:40:35] <rajkosto> .attr('id');
[18:40:44] <droope> yeap, that's right
[18:49:28] <martisj> I want to add an <li> to the end of a <ul> before the last <li> element how would i do that?
[18:49:45] <martisj> this is what i have so far: 						$('#CommentPosted-'+getpID).append($(response).fadeIn('fast'));
[18:49:52] <cheesypoof20> you could append to the :last-child
[18:50:26] <martisj> so $('#CommentPosted-'+getpID+':last-child').PREPEND($(response).fadeIn('fast'));
[18:50:27] <martisj> ?
[18:51:24] <cheesypoof20> i meant prepend*
[18:51:38] <shoky> no, .before()
[18:52:13] <cheesypoof20> correct you are
[18:52:13] <shoky> (instead of .prepend)
[18:52:42] <cheesypoof20> i meant like 'ul li:last-child' i dont think it would work with an id because they are unique
[18:54:30] <shoky> $('#CommentPosted-'+getpID).children('li').last().before( $(response).fadeIn('fast') )
[18:54:31] <shoky> i suppose
[18:54:45] <martisj> shoky: thanks
[18:54:46] <martisj> :D
[18:54:56] <Krinkle> Hi, I've been working on an application for a while and a sub module. While doing so I stumble on something rather odd. And I'm hoping someone can explain it to me.
[18:55:09] <Krinkle> Hm... brb
[18:57:16] <tomasp> Hi all. If have a set of div's and i want to move the first 2 to a different element. how is the best way to extra the first two?
[18:58:34] <shoky> you have a jq collection of the set of divs?
[18:59:25] <tomasp> like $("div.myclass").slice(0,2)
[18:59:41] <cordoval> if i have a text field and then a checkbox
[18:59:59] <cordoval> on a row and i have a first text field before the text field
[19:00:06] <cordoval> and i have this as the checkbox
[19:00:23] <cordoval> how to get to the first text field? $(this).prev().prev() ?
[19:00:45] <shoky> tomasp: you can do that with slice
[19:01:32] <tomasp> o ok thanks
[19:01:46] <shoky> ;P
[19:01:48] <defaultro> hey folks, I need to change the resizable value dynamically from false to true of dialog box. Currently, the value of resizable is false. I need to set it to true once I click click on a button. div id is #window_0. What would be the code for it?
[19:02:20] <defaultro> just need the value code only. The clicking of button code is done
[19:02:24] <Klevre> What's a good jquery plugin for single file uploads? specifically images?
[19:02:32] <cheesypoof20> cordoval i'm not sure I understand the mockup ordering, if you could provide a jsfiddle example i'm sure people could help you further
[19:02:43] <cheesypoof20> markup*
[19:03:12] <defaultro> is it $('#window_0').resizable = true;
[19:03:36] <shoky> defaultro: no, its  $('#window_0').dialog('option', 'resizable', true)
[19:03:53] <defaultro> cool, trying it now sir
[19:03:54] <shoky> all jquery ui widget options are set like that
[19:03:59] <defaultro> ah :)
[19:04:04] <shoky> read the docs ;p
[19:04:06] <rajkosto> i need to remove the first parent element in a text var
[19:04:31] <rajkosto> like if it has '<div><p></p></div>' i want just '<p></p>'
[19:05:47] <defaultro> need to find out why width resizing isn't working
[19:06:20] <droope> rajkosto: like this: $(string_variable).html()
[19:07:53] <cheesypoof20> I have a 'product quantity' text input. Would .keyup be the best way to trigger a form submission on a quantity change? Is there any way I could wait for a 1 second lull in typing then submit?
[19:08:11] <defaultro> what is the the second value used for in the code .animate({height:'450px'},700}? I noticed it still works even when I removed 700
[19:08:40] <shoky> defaultro: duration in ms
[19:08:40] <droope> cheesypoof20: no, The best way would be .change()
[19:08:45] <droope> cheesypoof20: imho
[19:08:52] <defaultro> oh ok
[19:08:57] <droope> defaultro: it's delay
[19:08:58] <defaultro> which api should I read about that?
[19:09:06] <defaultro> ok
[19:09:09] <shoky> how about animate() ?
[19:09:14] <defaultro> ok
[19:09:18] <droope> just google jquery animate
[19:09:20] <shoky> o_O
[19:09:23] <droope> you'll be fine :P
[19:09:29] <defaultro> cool
[19:09:31] <droope> See ya guys!
[19:09:42] <cheesypoof20> but the input has to lose focus first before the change registers, that might confuse someone
[19:09:44] <krz> some of my  <a> elements have the text "foobar". how can i update only the first <a> element with the text "foobar" to "foo"?
[19:09:53] <krz> I've gotten this far: $('#top_referers ul li a')
[19:09:55] <krz> lol
[19:09:58] <defaultro> i changed it to 10. I like it better, it;s quick! :)
[19:11:50] <cordoval> cheesypoof20: hi thanks for answering
[19:13:18] <cheesypoof20> you can thank me if i actually help you solve your problem :P
[19:13:52] <shoky> krz: var a = $('#top_referers ul li a:contains(foobar)')[0]; a.innerText = a.innerText.replace('foobar','foo');
[19:15:02] <krz> ah contains
[19:15:19] <cheesypoof20> what's the [0] represent?
[19:15:27] <shoky> to get the first one
[19:15:52] <krz> a:eq(0) or a:first works too :-)
[19:16:05] <shoky> i would've used .first()  but this is faster and i want to manipulate the DOM element directly anyway
[19:16:34] <iateadonut> i've got a problem with chrome - i've got a function within $(function () { - it loads up in firefox, but doesn't work in chrome.
[19:16:46] <iateadonut> if i click the button that is bound to the function after the page loads, it runs, though.
[19:17:31] <shoky> ?demo @ iateadonut
[19:17:31] <bot-t> iateadonut, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:18:34] <aaairc> if i do .find() and nothing is found... is what is returned "null"?
[19:18:45] <shoky> no
[19:19:20] <shoky> an empty jq collection is returned
[19:19:46] <aaairc> what would be the best method if i just want to check wether a jquery object contains an element with class ".highlight" for example?
[19:20:23] <shoky> jqObj.find('.highlight').length
[19:20:38] <shoky> if ( jqObj.find('.highlight').length ) {  ...  }
[19:21:15] <aaairc> shoky: k cool. thanks for the tip.
[19:21:20] <species> is creating a canvas in code the same as creating other nodes, or is there something extra I need to do?
[19:21:55] <shoky> it's the same afaik
[19:29:04] <iateadonut> don't know - i'm using a graphics library called flot: http://jsfiddle.net/4M2dS/1/ - doesn't seem to be working on this.
[19:29:36] <iateadonut> working on jsfiddle.
[19:30:12] <shoky> you have html tags in your javascript
[19:30:20] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4M2dS/2/
[19:31:09] <shoky> now without jsfiddle wrapping it in an onLoad handler for us:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/4M2dS/3/
[19:31:42] <iateadonut> oh
[19:34:48] <philsalesses_> Hey what's a good mac IRC client?
[19:35:00] <shoky> colloquy is fine
[19:35:55] <iateadonut> ok.  got it working now.  thanks guys.
[19:38:06] <cordoval> i figured it out
[19:38:10] <cordoval> nvm
[19:38:12] <cordoval> thanks
[19:38:14] <cordoval> you rock
[19:40:08] <Xtrivity> Hey guys, can any of you tell me why this does not work: 	width = $(window).width();wrapperWidth = width * 6;alert(wrapperWidth);
[19:40:22] <philsalesses_> What does it say?
[19:40:26] <shoky> what doesn't work about it..
[19:40:54] <iateadonut> shoky, thanks for your help
[19:41:09] <Xtrivity> shoky i get the error
[19:41:11] <shoky> np iateadonut
[19:41:23] <Xtrivity> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token *
[19:42:08] <shoky> that sounds odd.. let's see a live jsfiddle ;p
[19:43:03] <EotS> Any ideas on how I can find a  jquery mentor to help me solve problems?  I'm in way over my head...
[19:43:20] <shoky> either ask here
[19:43:24] <shoky> or flash some cash ;P
[19:44:09] <EotS> It's just that there's a whole page of code, so I can't see how I could effectively ask questions here...I can't even figure out a way to frame it properly for stackoverflow
[19:44:18] <rodd> I guess this isn't the right way to remove a node from an element before adding it to the document, what am I missing here? http://pastebin.com/iJ0jbYYH
[19:44:34] <shoky> EotS: then you need to break it down
[19:44:59] <rodd> latestGroup selector's content is present when inserting it at .after
[19:45:03] <EotS> is pastebin the way to share code here and ask questions?
[19:45:19] <rodd> EotS does it matter?
[19:45:30] <rodd> better than flooding the channel
[19:45:39] <EotS> I'm just asking, noob here...
[19:45:58] <rodd> You can use whatever paste tool you prefer
[19:45:58] <cheesypoof20> jsfiddle.net
[19:48:50] <shoky> rodd: els is html?
[19:49:07] <rodd> shoky yes
[19:50:10] <shoky> maybe try smth like this: http://pastebin.com/Ybq3x0pG
[19:51:02] <rodd> shoky hm a reference, let me see
[19:51:12] <shoky> cause the way you had it first, nothing was modifying that html string
[19:51:22] <shoky> not a reference, a jq object
[19:51:28] <rodd> touche
[19:51:30] <shoky> instead of an html string
[19:54:39] <rodd> shoky that did it, great! thanks!
[19:55:18] <shoky> ;)
[20:54:14] <Whirl3d> dang, nearly 1 hour with no chatter? You'd think people were out celebrating the weekend or something?
[20:56:18] <anusx4> Need help with deferred.  http://jsfiddle.net/TZAUP/
[20:56:29] <anusx4> I am trying to get those divs to fadeIn in the correct order.
[20:57:16] <anusx4> The catch is that the first two fades have to be wrapped in a function (e.g. two_stepper)
[20:58:04] <Whirl3d> so you want the irst two to fade at same time, then the third?
[20:58:21] <anusx4> no all in sequence
[20:59:01] <Whirl3d> I have never seen a deferred constucted the way you did there, (not saying it's wrong, I don't know). But here is how I would do it: usse the built in callback on animate
[20:59:10] <anusx4> i know the current state of that fiddle has some silliness i was just trying everything
[20:59:49] <anusx4> Whirl3d: yeah, i have several functions to call in sequence, so i wish not to have a large tree of callbacks upon callbacks, know what i mean?
[21:01:14] <anusx4> I'm forking the fiddle to make something a little more explanatory
[21:03:14] <eliseumds> I'm needing some advanced JS prototyping readings. Does anyone have a recommendation?
[21:03:30] <orangey1> I'm a bit confused about .getJSON
[21:03:58] <orangey1> I want the json *output* to go to the variable 'shiftDays'. I've tried:  $.getJSON('/kitab/trades/add.json', {id: $('#TradeFromUserId').val()}, shiftDays);     and also shiftDays =
[21:04:12] <orangey1> when I do the latter, I get back an object that appears to me to be impenetrable
[21:04:20] <anusx4> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/ZYSjM/1/
[21:04:21] <orangey1> I guess I just want the response text, not everything else?
[21:04:24] <eliseumds> getJSON is a normal Ajax request where the returned content is parsed as a JSON object.
[21:04:55] <orangey1> eliseumds: that's waht I thought, but it doesn't seem to come back as json
[21:05:22] <anusx4> orangey1: you'll want to write a callback just as usual, with the form function(your_json_response) { // do something with it }
[21:05:27] <eliseumds> Check out the request in the Resources panel (Chrome).
[21:05:39] <eliseumds> Ops... Network panel.
[21:05:53] <orangey1> anusx4: I just want it out as a variable.. nothing else done for now
[21:06:17] <orangey1> so that this actually gives me something other than 'undefined':   shiftDays = $.getJSON('/kitab/trades/add.json', {id: $('#TradeFromUserId').val()});	console.log(shiftDays.length);
[21:06:18] <eliseumds> A sample callback: function(json) { console.log(json.myAttr); }
[21:07:03] <eliseumds> No, no...
[21:07:04] <anusx4> orangey1: the callback needs to be an anonymous FUNCTION, and the third argument to .getJSON
[21:07:15] <eliseumds> This way you are doing will return the Ajax object.
[21:07:22] <eliseumds> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[21:07:27] <orangey1> eliseumds: yeah, i'm getting back the object.
[21:07:36] <orangey1> eliseumds: I've been going through the docs for about 30 mins
[21:07:40] <orangey1> will go read a bit more
[21:07:48] <psyolus> Anyone ever messed with input type serach?
[21:07:51] <psyolus> *search
[21:08:26] <orangey1> that page is short, and I can't correctly understand it, obviously
[21:08:31] <eliseumds> $.getJSON(URL, DATA, function(json) { // do whatever you want })
[21:08:36] <anusx4> orangey1: http://pastie.org/3928786
[21:09:06] <orangey1> eliseumds: I understand that. but what I actually want is all that data out as a variable.. so would that just be shiftDays = json; within that function?
[21:09:16] <eliseumds> Yep.
[21:09:27] <orangey1> aha. OK, thank you.
[21:09:31] <orangey1> apologies for being an idiot
[21:09:31] <eliseumds> var shiftDays; // inside the callback... shiftDays = json;
[21:09:39] <eliseumds> welcome man
[21:22:18] <shoky> anusx4: here's what i came up with: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TZAUP/1/    donno if it suits your needs
[21:22:48] <shoky> the way you did it, you lose reference to that new piped promise
[21:23:38] <anusx4> shoky: this is where I am now, it's a little clear about my needs http://jsfiddle.net/ZYSjM/5/
[21:23:46] <anusx4> I will look over yours here now
[21:27:58] <shoky> anusx4: your last fiddle updated : http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZYSjM/28/
[21:28:23] <shoky> all i did was return the piped promise instead of the original deferred
[21:28:46] <anusx4> ah yeah, I was just working on taking your same logic to the new fiddle.  you're faster
[21:29:20] <anusx4> I can see how it works, it's not firm in my head yet but it will be. THANK YOU.
[21:29:29] <shoky> since you moved the .resolve() inside the functions, there's no need to return the origDfd anymore
[21:29:35] <shoky> np
[21:29:38] <anusx4> this solves a much larger problem for me, which I had abstracted into the a/b/c stuff
[21:29:57] <anusx4> day 1: $.Deferred.  whew
[21:30:06] <shoky> ;)
[21:30:39] <Whirl3d> wait, isn't that an awful lot of code for a simple sequential animation?
[21:30:56] <Whirl3d> I am obviously missing something
[21:31:48] <shoky> well as he said, it's a much larger problem
[21:31:51] <anusx4> the fadeIns are just standins for the real code, which is much more complex and would just have distracted from solving the prob
[21:32:36] <Whirl3d> np. I can be happy with just not understanding this one
[21:33:47] <shoky> yea it's tricky code, it's the first time i see that usage of $.Deferred constructor too
[21:33:49] <Whirl3d> Just seems to me that $.Callbacks() would sequentially handle the entire thing in one loop.
[21:34:47] <shoky> hmm sequentially yes, but it'd just call of them in an instant, no?
[21:35:31] <shoky> without waiting for any result from each 'stage'
[21:35:47] <shoky> which is where deferreds obviously come in
[21:40:57] <anusx4> man im so happy about getting that solved, shoky.  too tipsy to log into any work servers to implement it, but i'll be ready to go in the morning for usre
[21:42:16] <shoky> ;]
[21:47:44] <shoky> anusx4: btw that whole $.Deferred( .. ).resolve() part in the end could be turned into just a().pipe(b).pipe(c)
[21:47:56] <shoky> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZYSjM/45/
[21:49:27] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TZAUP/11/   (slow, for effect)
[21:49:36] <martisj> how can i fadein a change to .val text?
[21:50:19] <martisj> i want to fade this text in $("#post_question").val(watermark_text);
[21:50:22] <martisj> is it possible?
[21:52:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/TZAUP/14/
[21:52:39] <Whirl3d> ^ has a master deferred that keeps track of when all the elements are faded in
[21:53:09] <anusx4> nice, I can learn from these for sure
[21:53:20] <anusx4> thanks Whirl3d
[21:53:46] <Whirl3d> np.
[21:54:37] <shoky> Whirl3d: regarding your first fiddle, isn't this much cleaner: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TZAUP/15/
[21:54:38] <jamarcuss> hello. i'm devloping a plugin with the widget factory. where's the best place to put utility / static methods?
[21:54:46] <jamarcuss> $.myplugin = ...?
[21:55:05] <shoky> Whirl3d: why mess with context and resolveWith and .apply
[21:55:28] <Whirl3d> I had tried that at first and had problems.
[21:55:39] <Whirl3d> But you got it to work just fine, thanks.
[21:55:56] <shoky> ah
[21:56:36] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZYSjM/32/    might lock up browser, beware
[21:57:39] <shoky> lots of errors
[21:58:02] <Whirl3d> yeah, so I tried the new apporach and the context was a side effect
[21:58:03] <Whirl3d> lol
[21:59:19] <shoky> maybe you meant this? :)  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ZYSjM/46/
[22:02:33] <anusx4> im a little bit blown away by jsfiddle, never quite looked at it closely before.  amazing tool
[22:02:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/ZYSjM/48/
[22:03:06] <Whirl3d> shoky, this is what I thought I was trying to do...
[22:03:11] <anusx4> as usually happens, my abstraction was a bit leaky.  there are not necessarily three functions a/b/c, and they certainly don't do simple fadeIns
[22:07:54] <shoky> and do you have 4 anuses?
[22:10:06] <anusx4> just 1 :(
[22:11:09] <shoky> :(
[22:13:17] <Whirl3d> Ohhh, I thought it was anus-sex for....
[22:17:10] <Back2Basics> I think there might be a problem with this because it looks like the code in "submitHandler: function (form) {" is getting bypassed.  anyone know why?  http://jsfiddle.net/qEBk7/
[22:17:32] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: there are script kiddies in here.  shhhh
[22:17:35] <Lurzino> hello everyone!!!!!!!! :))))))))
[22:20:22] <Lurzino> if anyone used jqWidgets, someone knows how I can settle back jqxSwitchButton's state without executing bind()'s function? Like I press the switchbutton and ask if really wants to, if not just set back to false but without executing again the bind()
[22:22:26] <Whirl3d> ? fiddle @ Lurzino
[22:22:28] <bot-t1> Lurzino, #10785 (jQuery .html().replace breaks in IE7-8 only. Example fiddle ... - Opened 4 weeks ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10785
[22:22:32] <Whirl3d> nvm
[22:22:34] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:22:45] <Whirl3d> Lurzino, setup a fiddle so we have something to look at, please
[22:24:40] <angelazou> hi it's my first time trying to use jquery and ajax for file uploads
[22:24:48] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, here are a couple of things with your fiddle: First, there's no need for the <script> tags, it implies them automatically for you...so that eliminates your first errors
[22:24:53] <angelazou> I've got a few questions about how I can proceed
[22:25:04] <Lurzino> then I'll paste later because I have the function in a usb pen I forgot at office hehe
[22:25:21] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, then you need to click "Add Resources" to the left and include a link to your validation plugin
[22:25:27] <angelazou> I have a feed sharing, so there is a textbox and file upload to create the feed
[22:25:32] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, then we can talk.
[22:25:34] <batmanian> how can I get the initial offset of a dragged element?
[22:26:02] <Whirl3d> batmanian, using ?
[22:26:10] <batmanian> jquery ui
[22:26:19] <batmanian> so I have made an element draggable
[22:26:23] <Whirl3d> isn't there a dragStart event callback or something
[22:26:38] <batmanian> no
[22:26:47] <detain> Can you use jquerymobile to make widgets for the android/iphone ?
[22:27:16] <Whirl3d> batmanian, there sure is.
[22:27:53] <batmanian> Whirl3d in the drop callback of the droppable handler I am dropping into, I can access the dragged element using ui.draggable
[22:28:03] <batmanian> I was wondering if I could also access its initial offset?
[22:28:07] <Whirl3d> batmanian, $("element").draggable({start:function () {var myOffset=$(this).offset(); $(this).data("orig",myOffset)}})
[22:28:45] <batmanian> thanks Whirl3d
[22:29:27] <Whirl3d> I may have the wrong number of }) cuz I suck at all that, but you get the idea: store the info in the elements data object on drag start...then you can access it again on drag end
[22:30:05] <Whirl3d> detain, I don't see why not.
[22:30:23] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: Ty for looking at it
[22:30:43] <detain> Odd i havent really found any, I mean compaired to the alternatives of writing them in java/c.. you'd think there would be tons of jquerymobile widgets
[22:30:46] <Whirl3d> np. Did you fix those two things? Cause then we can check it out.
[22:31:08] <Whirl3d> Oh, you are asking for native widgets
[22:31:12] <Whirl3d> Like with bootstrap
[22:31:18] <Whirl3d> I dunno about all that.
[22:31:54] <jamarcuss> hello. i'm devloping a plugin with the widget factory. where's the best place to put utility / static methods?
[22:32:29] <Whirl3d> jamarcuss, it depends on your code?
[22:33:23] <ajpiano> jamarcuss: do they need to be publicly available?
[22:33:43] <Whirl3d> ajpiano! Did you make your train?
[22:33:51] <ajpiano> fortunately yes
[22:33:53] <ajpiano> the train was running late
[22:33:58] <ajpiano> ...later than me
[22:33:59] <ajpiano> :p
[22:34:00] <Whirl3d> pfew
[22:34:29] <jamarcuss> ajpiano: yes
[22:35:04] <ajpiano> jamarcuss: sticking them $.your.widget.whatever = function() { };
[22:35:09] <ajpiano> would seem to be the operative move
[22:35:18] <jamarcuss> $.plugin.method? $.namespace.method? $.namespace.plugin.method?
[22:35:41] <ajpiano> $.namespace.plugin.method if it's a static method that's still related to a particular widget
[22:35:44] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/qEBk7/2/
[22:36:18] <jamarcuss> i'm still awfully confused by the namespace part. what's the point if it gets attached to $.plugin by $.bridge()?
[22:36:26] <oojacoboo> anyone use uploadify?
[22:36:34] <Whirl3d> okay, so what's the problem then, Back2Basics?
[22:36:34] <oojacoboo> the damn thing is doing some strange stuff
[22:36:44] <ajpiano> it doesn't get attahed to $.plugin, it gets attached to $.fn.plugin
[22:36:49] <Lurzino> see ya later
[22:37:09] <Whirl3d> cya Lurzino.
[22:37:51] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: I'm getting post values instead of the json object.  I think it's skipping "submitHandler: function (form) {"
[22:38:05] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: it's validating though.
[22:38:07] <ajpiano> the thing on $.fn is a wrapper around instantiating the prototype stored at $.namespace.widgetname jamarcuss
[22:39:19] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, you have to manually call the submit handler if you preventDefault
[22:40:01] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: it's sending anyway
[22:40:02] <jamarcuss> ajpiano: ah okay that makes sense thanks
[22:40:26] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: I don't think it's getting to the form.preventDefault
[22:40:39] <Whirl3d> I was just looking at your code some more...You are preventing default on the form, not the submit
[22:40:53] <Whirl3d> which doesn't make sense, I would guess....
[22:41:40] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: I wouldn't have caught that.
[22:42:19] <Whirl3d> I am not sure how your validate plugin works, but usually you would bind the submit event to a submitHandler
[22:42:52] <Whirl3d> the submitHandler would preventDefault on the submit event and then validate, manually submit
[22:44:34] <jaha> any reason in jquery 1.7* i cant get the value of a select option with $('select').val(); after its been changed ??
[22:46:24] <oojacoboo> anyone use uploadify?
[22:47:25] <sente> oojacoboo: i use a fork of an old version
[22:47:37] <oojacoboo> I'm thinking about doing that
[22:47:45] <sente> which is more simpler / more stable
[22:47:58] <oojacoboo> this damn thing is ajax reloading the page and sending params to my page
[22:48:02] <sente> which was necessary for dealing with huge uploads (500MB+) from people with shitty connections
[22:48:22] <oojacoboo> yea
[22:49:33] <sente> actually this might be from before it was called 'uploadify'
[22:50:12] <sente> in any event, http://sentedrop.com/upload/ is simple
[22:50:41] <oojacoboo> sente, uploadfily supports all that :P
[22:50:47] <oojacoboo> uploadify*
[22:50:55] <oojacoboo> param 'multi' for one ;)
[22:50:58] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, without the unminified validate.js source, it's not really easy to determine what you are supposed to send the validate plugin or what you can expect back.
[22:51:43] <sente> yeah i'm aware
[22:51:45] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: validating isn't the problem  that part works
[22:53:19] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: if the field contains class ="required" then it doesn't submit, it marks the form fields in red, and gives a message under each field telling them this is required.
[22:53:29] <angelazou> i have an ajax call that returns some html that I would like to insert as the first child of an element, how do I do that?
[22:53:44] <oojacoboo> http://www.uploadify.com/forum/#/discussion/8241/posting-additional-data-on-version-3-1
[22:53:47] <oojacoboo> bingo!
[22:54:13] <oojacoboo> mehâ€¦ nm that's a noob error ><
[22:54:27] <Whirl3d> but what is the validation plugin expecting that you send it an object with two paramters: rules and submitHandler?
[22:55:03] <Whirl3d> usually, you pass the form and the rules and the validation plugin can figure out the rest.
[22:55:37] <Whirl3d> often, a validation plugin (on instantiation) will override the forms default submit handler to insert itself )
[22:55:57] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[22:56:14] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: I just found it myself.
[22:57:46] <Whirl3d> under too much recursion?
[22:58:37] <Back2Basics> you read fast
[22:59:59] <Whirl3d> I don't see where, in all that documentation that it states you can send an object with the paramter (submitHandler) and it will validate...
[23:00:48] <krz> I've got 3 span.total elements that contain numbers. how do i sum all these up with: $('#top_countries ul li span.total')
[23:01:23] <krz> do i have to go through an each loop? or is there a better way?
[23:08:52] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: so If I make a function for the button.submit()  which one takes precident?  the form validation or the button.submit()?
[23:09:38] <Back2Basics> or can I do another $("#form_create_concept") function.
[23:09:57] <angelazou> how do I find an element's sibling with a particular class?
[23:12:28] <angelazou> is this the way to do it? $(this).siblings("feed-user").text == $("#username").text
[23:13:59] <anli_> text is a function
[23:14:09] <anli_> so .text($('#username').text())
[23:15:35] <angelazou> oh, so maybe I should use .val instead?
[23:15:43] <angelazou>  I want to compare the value between them
[23:16:47] <d[^_^]b> angelazou, give it a go then see how it goes ^_^
[23:21:32] <RoboCop>  can anyone please help me decoding this: http://pastebin.com/KKCzkktR
[23:21:43] <RoboCop> i am absolutely new to javascript. i tried RegExp cheet sheet but got very confused. please help.
[23:23:24] <Back2Basics> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/qEBk7/5/  still submits and still no ajax'y json goodness  but I split up the functions.
[23:26:10] <Back2Basics> robocop: saw this line before this morning "".*[a-z]{2}[ ].*[d-i](?=.*)");"    how many people in the class?
[23:26:31] <krz> anyone used https://github.com/manifestinteractive/jqvmap before? I'm trying to set a color for a country dynamically through a var called country_name. doesn't seem to work: $('#map').vectorMap('set', 'colors', { country_name: 'green' });
[23:26:45] <krz> works with $('#map').vectorMap('set', 'colors', { us: 'green' });
[23:26:50] <krz> anyone know why?
[23:27:17] <krz> country_name = 'us'
[23:27:46] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: hello sir. it was me this morning as well. its not a school project, but a JavaScript challenge. can you please help?
[23:30:50] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: RegExp Cheet Sheet just made me too confused. Maybe because I'm absolutely new to JavaScript. But I wish to learn, and therefore require someone's precious guidance.
[23:30:59] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: you can object.  if you have to use a regex it's generally bad code.  if they have to use 14  WOW they suck.
[23:31:51] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: Well I guess thats the challenge.
[23:32:27] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: and knowing when something is not worth fighting for is half the battle.
[23:33:18] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: so, can I espect some help?
[23:34:01] <Whirl3d> robocop, not good to expect anything But I might be able to help
[23:34:25] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: http://gskinner.com/RegExr/
[23:34:49] <Whirl3d> I use regexbuddy and it rocks
[23:34:55] <RoboCop> Whirl3d: thanks for caring sir.
[23:35:07] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: thanks for the link sir.
[23:36:49] <RoboCop> Whirl3d: shall i get RegExBuddy for this one?
[23:38:28] <Whirl3d> I'm still not sure what it will give you. I looked it up, but it looks like "ab stuff d
[23:39:14] <Whirl3d> regexbuddy is great. I would heartily suggest that you get it if you are planning on doing regex regularly
[23:39:19] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: you will have to piece all these together
[23:39:28] * woozly nice
[23:39:55] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: I would start with the regex specifying the begining and end of the string.
[23:40:12] <RoboCop> <Back2Basics> Please sir.
[23:42:11] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: I have a life.  and a paypal account.  and for $50 I'll help
[23:42:55] <Back2Basics> You have the tools that I would use.  you have the time.  GO FOR IT with GUSTO
[23:43:22] <anusx4> with caps like that you're a fool to refuse
[23:44:17] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: I respect your thinking sir. But for a student of age 17, that wont be possible to afford a bank account. Hope you won't mind. Thanks anyways.
[23:44:45] <Back2Basics> anusx4: I told him already that he was foolish for trying.  but if he doesn't listen to the truth then I start making stuff up.
[23:45:05] <anusx4> and then he decides to listen to the truth
[23:45:11] <anusx4> after much foolishness
[23:45:19] <anusx4> but all that's left is madeupness
[23:45:30] <anusx4> give that some thought!
[23:49:42] <Back2Basics> RoboCop: Pythonchallenge.com is actually quite good.
[23:50:26] <RoboCop> Back2Basics: thanks again for the link sir.
[23:56:38] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, you still have the same problem: form.preventDefault() does nothing.
[23:57:26] <Whirl3d> Back2Basics, $(form).on("submit", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $(this).validate();});
[23:57:47] <Whirl3d> the preventDefault method is a method of the event, not the target of the event.
