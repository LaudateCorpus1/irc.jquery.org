[00:07:49] <pavonia> .post is a special case of .ajax, it's also asynchronous
[00:12:23] <Uhkis> i wonder what the first a in ajax stands for... automatic? :D
[00:39:40] <kiwi_79> is there a way to get the ajax response url somehow?
[00:39:48] <kiwi_79> so i know which server returned the data?
[01:42:25] <Cork> kiwi_79: the server can set an extra header with the url, or you can include it in the data response
[01:42:27] <Cork> else, no
[01:43:06] <Cork> it is one of the annoying limitations of the old xhr method (in javascript not a jquery limitation)
[02:39:29] <thykka> Uhkis, AJAX <-- Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
[02:41:09] <Cork> thykka: you get that the question was retorical right?
[02:41:31] <thykka> no question on the internet is rethorical, unless explicitly stated
[02:44:18] <thykka> (see: Poe's law)
[03:39:17] <Uhkis> thykka: come on, that smiley was almost literally from poe's law
[03:43:11] <thykka> well, I had not had my coffee at that point yet
[03:45:10] <Uhkis> :)
[06:18:18] <crs> Hi guys, I haver asked that alrady and solution was to use another animting library, which is problematic for me as I barely know js… I have this problem where showing element works fine, but hiding it causes that element to increase in size initially. I have no clue why. This is the code: https://codepen.io/djll/pen/pozrPVQ - please click on magnifying glass icon to show search input and then
[06:18:24] <crs> again to hide and see how it resizes first…
[06:49:49] <Cork> crs: when the element is animated the libraries add overflow hidden to them to keep the elements inside it
[06:50:01] <Cork> this changes how margin is calculated
[06:50:31] <Cork> (noramly it escapes the parent element unless it has a few specific properties set
[06:50:33] <Cork> )
[07:08:53] <crs> Cork: Is it something I an fix by adding some bootstrap classes to parent elements?
[07:09:24] <Cork> crs: you can fix it by modifying the css for the elements
[07:09:34] <Cork> it isn't as simple as just adding classes though
[07:10:24] <crs> Cork: OK, thank you very much for that. I am not sure what's broken so fixing it is way beyond my abilities. I guess if I managed to use another library I would still have similar problem?
[07:10:57] <Cork> as long as you do similar things ya
[07:12:16] <crs> Cork: Boo, then I am out of luck I guess. :( I also have similar problems elsewhere, where animations do the same thing, so I would like to get it fixed properly. Is is something you would have time and will to help me with?
[07:12:58] <Cork> i could if you reproduced the problem (not all of them but an example) in a jsfiddle
[07:24:16] <crs> Cork: So not in codepen?
[07:24:27] <crs> Because this is almost my live code there.
[07:24:45] <Cork> it makes it harder to work with, but ya, it works there too
[07:25:08] <Cork> will prob have problem to look at it as it right now though
[07:25:10] <crs> Thanks, I dont have an account on jsfiddle, but can get one I guess if I hae to
[07:25:45] <crs> Cork: No rush, it's been like this for a while so little bit longer wont make any difference. :)
[07:34:14] <crs> Cork: BTW, I am dreaming of that select2 widget to go like fullscreen, but coulddn't find any examples of it, so resorted to what I have in that codepen.
[07:34:54] <thykka> you don't need an account to make a jsfiddle
[08:06:02] <crs> Ah yeah, that's true thykka. I can move it over if there is a need for it…
[10:58:01] <githree_> Hi, I am looking for pointers on how to debug a button on buttonset (jQueryUI)
[10:58:22] <thykka> 0x00c2, 0x00f1
[10:58:49] <thykka> console.log is debugging 101, but your browser also ships with a step-debugger. have you tried either?
[10:58:52] <githree_> the button should work as a toggle (checkbox?) but on click nothing happens
[10:59:32] <githree_> I tried global mouse click event but it went through 1000 lines of code and I am not sure what I am looking for
[11:00:28] <thykka> put a breakpoint within your event handler?
[11:04:35] <githree_> that's what I am looking for - I don't know where the event handler is created in jQueryUI
[14:03:53] <RoseBus> hello, i'm using .clone() on a div to clone an entire form.
[14:04:25] <RoseBus> I passed true paramater to .clone() so that user input data is also copied to the new fomr
[14:04:37] <RoseBus> but the dropdowns aren't copying their current selection over
[14:05:19] <RoseBus> all of my dropdowns are "sel" css class
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> (classes aren't just for css btw)
[14:05:41] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20190918.log.html#t14:32:38
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> we talked about this yesterday.,
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[14:07:58] <robertmaxrees> RoseBus
[14:11:19] <RoseBus> i'm having trouble integrating your solution with my page
[14:11:24] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:11:56] <robertmaxrees> basically, you need to enumerate over each of the selects in the source form and apply those to the corresponding select in the new one.
[14:12:40] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could build an array of objects with "name" and "value" properties, and then forEach over that to do basically the same thing.
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> RoseBus make sense?
[14:22:09] <robertmaxrees> RoseBus i can help you through either of those scenarios :) i even have a working example already.
[14:23:41] <RoseBus> this is what i have so far... i created const $toCopy
[14:23:43] <RoseBus> https://bpaste.net/show/dc-e
[14:24:42] <RoseBus> whops disregard this line:     $(row).find('[id$="sel"]');
[14:25:18] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:25:28] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:25:36] <RoseBus> lol
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> where's the relevand code?
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> *relevant
[14:26:08] <RoseBus> the html portion?
[14:26:15] <robertmaxrees> for the selects.
[14:26:40] <robertmaxrees> is $(row).find('[id$="sel"]'); all you've got?
[14:27:35] <RoseBus> no disregard that line
[14:27:41] <RoseBus> the class is 'sel'
[14:27:44] <RoseBus> not the id
[14:27:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:28:01] <robertmaxrees> lol so do you have any js for trying to copy the selects over?
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> and syncing their values?
[14:28:34] <RoseBus> working on it
[14:28:41] <RoseBus> i'm putting together a jsfiddle page
[14:28:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/p6jmugv9/
[14:28:45] <RoseBus> with my html & js
[14:28:48] <robertmaxrees> here's a freebie.
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> really not that difficult.
[14:30:09] <RoseBus> it is for me :|
[14:30:23] <robertmaxrees> i mean conceptually :)
[14:32:13] <RoseBus> i get the concept
[14:32:17] <RoseBus> it's js syntax
[14:32:30] <RoseBus> and jquery
[14:32:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:33:55] <RoseBus> what is the properties 'name'?
[14:34:00] <RoseBus> i mean the element's name
[14:34:06] <RoseBus> do i need to name it in my html form?
[14:34:12] <robertmaxrees> <select name="bar">
[14:34:30] <RoseBus> ahh okay
[14:37:53] <taplar> <select name="bar"><option selected>high</option></select>
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:38:19] <taplar> html yokes
[14:38:33] <robertmaxrees> eggxactly
[15:09:33] <RoseBus> is there a difference between `row` and `$(row)` if row is set to $(someqeury).get()
[15:12:24] <taplar> RoseBus can you elaborate on that?
[15:12:37] <taplar> ${row} is a pattern used in template literals
[15:19:34] <RoseBus> i just have a variable robertmaxrees i tried to implement your freebie solution but for some reason it's not updating the cloned dropdowns
[15:19:36] <RoseBus> https://bpaste.net/show/cYTh
[15:19:52] <RoseBus> (minus) `i just have a variable`
[15:20:30] * taplar was ignored...
[15:20:42] <RoseBus> sry taplar, it doesn't have to do with template literals
[15:21:02] <RoseBus> but if u look at that link, u see my var row = ....
[15:21:15] <taplar> Then I'm confused on why you mentioned ${row}
[15:21:16] <RoseBus> then row is referenced like this: $(row)
[15:21:24] <RoseBus> i never used curly braces
[15:21:31] <taplar> ah, my bad
[15:21:51] <taplar> row is set from get(0).  get() returns the raw Element
[15:22:04] <taplar> $(row) turns it into a jQuery object containing the Element in it's result set
[15:22:15] <RoseBus> ahh okay
[15:22:19] <taplar> You could change get(0) to eq(0) and you wouldn't have to do that
[15:23:02] <taplar> same way on line four $(firstform) is unnecessary
[15:23:06] <taplar> first() returns a jquery object
[15:23:35] <RoseBus> cool
[15:24:58] <taplar> line 13 also needs a `var` in front of the variable to scope it down to the mehtod, unless that is intentional
[15:29:03] <RoseBus> ty, would `let` work
[15:30:03] <taplar> absolutely, provided you do not need IE support
[15:31:10] <RoseBus> lame
[15:31:13] <RoseBus> def need IE suport
[15:32:07] <taplar> let is supported by Edge, but not IE
[15:33:16] <RoseBus> okay and in the foreach loop, i used console.log to show that it has the right value for each pair, which it does, but for some reason the new forms are not getting the new value selected
[15:34:07] <RoseBus> o wait, i think i might no why
[15:45:23] <RoseBus> we did it robertmaxrees
[15:45:30] <RoseBus> my dropdowns are duplicating
[15:46:09] <RoseBus> the names in the cloned form are actually not the same as the names in the previous form so i had to use some regex
[17:48:36] <Stoot> does anyone what the replacement library is for tagedit.webwork-albrecht.de ?
[18:09:17] <crs> Cork: I am free now if you have time and will. :)
[18:14:32] * Stoot takes crs... sorry Cork not free anymore :D
[18:22:42] <crs> Will wait for my turn. :)
[18:37:38] <Stoot> robertmaxrees you are smart weren't you ?
[18:40:18] <taplar> not any more.  he ate a snickers and everything got fked up
[18:40:44] <taplar> friggen peanut allergies
[18:40:47] * taplar does cross sign
[18:50:50] <Stoot> taplar ouch, ok!
[18:51:14] <Stoot> damn I need some replacement for tagedit.webwork-albrecht.de which seem to have died
[18:53:20] <Stoot> taplar next time don't feed the monkey OK ?
[18:53:32] <taplar> hmm?
[18:53:40] <Stoot> snickers...
[18:53:48] <taplar> lol.  monkey?
[18:53:58] <Stoot> We know you want to be the best but please don't cheat :P
[18:54:10] <taplar> lmao.  gotcha
[18:54:28] <Stoot> yeah we could call him a hippo if you like :D
[20:35:12] <optics> can anyone help me with a select2.js dropdown autoselection on ready using jquery?
[20:35:30] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need?
[20:35:30] <optics> $("#myselectname").val('mummaschicken').change();
[20:35:59] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[20:36:02] <optics> used to work but after updating select2 it does not do anything, no errors just select nothing
[20:36:11] <robertmaxrees> test case?
[20:36:33] <optics> oh i will chuck one together
[20:44:25] <optics> https://jsfiddle.net/qvs5xeod/
[20:44:36] <optics> that works but it's not using select2.js yet
[20:45:24] <robertmaxrees> ok?
[20:45:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:51:43] <kiwi_79> hi, i have this snipped... for some reason the url doesnt change to x2 when iterating
[20:51:52] <kiwi_79> i send a post request
[20:51:54] <kiwi_79> https://jsfiddle.net/0ewavq91/
[20:52:22] <kiwi_79> i shows the right value
[20:52:46] <kiwi_79> but currUrl shows the url with -x1 and not -x2 in the second interation
[20:52:48] <kiwi_79> not sure why
[20:56:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:56:29] <robertmaxrees> how do you know the URL isn't changing?
[20:58:43] <kiwi_79> do you see the console.log?
[20:58:48] <kiwi_79> var currUrl = url.replace("{counter}", i);                        console.log("send request to:", currUrl, i);
[20:58:49] <robertmaxrees> can you whittle the problem down a bit?
[20:58:51] <robertmaxrees> lot of extra code.
[20:59:46] <kiwi_79> you see the loop right?
[20:59:50] <kiwi_79> it increments i
[20:59:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:59:51] <robertmaxrees> yes
[21:00:47] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to figure out why that replace isn't working?
[21:00:55] <kiwi_79> i send a actual post request
[21:01:01] <kiwi_79> maybe it has something to do with that
[21:01:05] <robertmaxrees> ...
[21:01:07] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to figure out why that replace isn't working?
[21:01:34] <kiwi_79> i run the code in my browser
[21:01:42] <kiwi_79> but i cannot reproduce with jsfiddle
[21:01:54] <kiwi_79> the only extra code i have is the post requet
[21:01:57] <kiwi_79> request
[21:04:21] <kiwi_79> ok here now: https://jsfiddle.net/0ewavq91/1/
[21:04:46] <kiwi_79> there are 2 requests send to: http://ewr-byoa-x1:6060/requestSnifferInternal
[21:04:53] <robertmaxrees> what's not how you use $.post
[21:05:04] <kiwi_79> but i expect: http://ewr-byoa-x1:6060/requestSnifferInternal and http://ewr-byoa-x2:6060/requestSnifferInternal
[21:05:31] <kiwi_79> ok that could be the issue
[21:06:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/nszw8b34/
[21:06:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass it an object.
[21:07:32] <kiwi_79> where?
[21:07:36] <robertmaxrees> #.post
[21:07:42] <robertmaxrees> * $.post
[21:08:06] <kiwi_79> oh
[21:08:25] <kiwi_79> is there a way to pass i to the success function too?
[21:08:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:09:02] <kiwi_79> you see what i do with: var index = getServerId(currUrl); ?
[21:09:05] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/n7grLmo1/ it's already available there.
[21:09:36] <kiwi_79> that var index = getServerId(currUrl); gives me the id ... basically i of the request the callback was called with
[21:09:46] <kiwi_79> to disable button display things etc
[21:09:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:10:03] <kiwi_79> do you see var index = getServerId(currUrl);  in the code?
[21:10:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah?
[21:11:26] <kiwi_79> http://ewr-byoa-x1:6060/requestSnifferInternal  -> gives 1 .... http://ewr-byoa-x1:6060/requestSnifferInternal -> gives 2 ... the i bascially...but i can directly use i?
[21:11:38] <kiwi_79> http://ewr-byoa-x2:6060/requestSnifferInternal -> gives 2
[21:11:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[21:12:04] <robertmaxrees> you're not making sense...
[21:12:05] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:12:14] <kiwi_79> like this? https://jsfiddle.net/1tb57gr6/
[21:13:08] <robertmaxrees> super lost
[21:13:59] <kiwi_79> why?
[21:14:47] <kiwi_79> e.g. after the last request was success fully i want to run: $("#submitBtn").prop('disabled', false);
[21:14:52] <kiwi_79> to enable the button again
[21:15:27] <kiwi_79> and the first request only should print: "==============Sniff Completed=================="
[21:18:30] <kiwi_79> im just wondering how that part of code can be improved in the $.post
[21:18:47] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[21:18:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[21:20:14] <kiwi_79> here is the latest code: https://jsfiddle.net/1tb57gr6/2/
[21:20:23] <robertmaxrees> busy.  will be back.
[21:20:44] <pavonia> i is never 0 in that code, is it?
[21:20:55] <kiwi_79> no it start with 1
[21:20:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:21:11] <kiwi_79> oh lol
[21:21:24] <robertmaxrees> there's a much better way to do this.
[21:21:32] <kiwi_79> https://jsfiddle.net/1tb57gr6/3/
[21:21:37] <kiwi_79> here the i fix :)
[21:21:39] <pavonia> kiwi_79: Have you looked into .when as suggested yesterday?
[21:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ use when
[21:21:55] <kiwi_79> it was late yesterday... can you resend me the link?
[21:22:02] <kiwi_79> i think i got disconnected

[21:22:27] <pavonia> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[21:23:03] <kiwi_79> robertmaxrees i might also need fail case for the post
[21:23:08] <kiwi_79> to handle error
[21:23:37] <robertmaxrees> .catch()
[21:28:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:28:45] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeee
[21:31:51] <kiwi_79> pavonia need to see how i can use when with post
[23:06:40] <optics> so i discovered the problem with mummascakes
[23:07:17] <optics> the select option value now has underscores for spaced words
[23:07:42] <optics> but my session variable i return for the option value has spaces
[23:08:11] <optics> so now i have come up with this filth which i know is wrong
[23:08:19] <optics> $("#myselect").val('<?php echo str_replace(' ', '_', strtolower(echo $_SESSION['mummascakes'])); ?>').change();
[23:08:50] <optics> mummascakes might return ding dong
[23:08:58] <optics> i need to make it ding_dong
[23:10:38] <optics> any ideas how i can make ding dong return ding_dong from $_SESSION['mummascakes']
[23:11:18] <optics> maybe i should take this to #php lol
[23:33:12] <optics> ahh got it nice
[23:34:38] <optics> $("#myselect").val('<?php echo(str_replace(' ', '_', ($_SESSION['mummascakes']))); ?>').change();
[23:34:45] <optics> thanks for the help dudes
