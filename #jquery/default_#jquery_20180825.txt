[00:29:29] <SlimmyJimmy> I'm at a breakpoint in a function in Chrome. When I type 'this;' in the console it say it's 't.fn.init'. But when I type just 't', or 't.fn.' or 't.fn.init' it says 'undefined'. How is this?
[09:09:15] <jquery514> can someone tell me why .click doesnt work please?
[09:09:16] <jquery514> http://jsfiddle.net/exyp6d3L/
[09:56:14] <shoky> jquery514: because you're calling .click on a raw dom element, not on a jquery object
[09:56:57] <jquery514> shoky: how can i make this work please?
[09:57:09] <shoky> jquery514:  $(element).click(...)
[09:57:33] <jquery514> shoky: thank you very much :)
[09:58:21] <jquery514> shoky: also is line 29 - 33 right?
[09:58:53] <jquery514> it works but may have done it wrong...if this dialog doenst exists create new...if exists return current one
[10:01:36] <shoky> jquery514: no,  passing $.dialog to $.data doesn't seem right,  the data key needs to be a string.   if (!$.data(this, 'mydialog') { $.data(this, 'mydialog', new $.dialog(...)); }
[10:02:26] <jquery514> shoky: thank you....but what happens if $.data(this, 'mydialog')
[10:02:36] <shoky> jquery514:  nothing
[10:02:50] <jquery514> should it load $.data(this, 'mydialog') and not create new?
[10:03:23] <shoky> jquery514: "load" it?  what is there to load?  the dialog has already been created - there is nothing to do
[10:03:38] <jquery514> shoky: ok thank you :)
[10:03:41] <shoky> ;]
[11:08:30] <jquery514> shoky: line 59 it says confirm isnt a function can tell me why please http://jsfiddle.net/exyp6d3L/3/
[11:08:43] <jquery514> ive tried to return this
[11:26:02] <jquery514> ive updates after more reading but still says  $(...).dialog(...).confirm    http://jsfiddle.net/exyp6d3L/4/
[11:39:34] <shoky> jquery514: you don't have a $.fn.confirm  so you can't call it on jquery objects
[11:43:07] <jquery514> shoky: but im trying to access the public function this.confirm
[11:44:54] <shoky> jquery514:  you can access it now with:  .data('dialog').confirm(...)  because you stored the dialog object with $.data
[11:45:36] <shoky> jquery514:  you can expose it also with an API like  .dialog('confirm', ...)   but you need to set up your $.fn.dialog function to do that
[11:45:55] <shoky> that's what e.g. jquery-ui does
[11:46:22] <jquery514> umm whats my best option?
[11:46:31] <jquery514> change the way dialog is stored?
[11:47:20] <shoky> you can also make  the $.fn.dialog  return the actual 'new' API object you created
[11:47:24] <shoky> and then just call methods on it
[11:47:40] <shoky> that would probably be easiest.
[11:48:27] <shoky> jquery514:  i like this old doc about plugin authoring  http://web.archive.org/web/20130502100718/http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[11:48:39] <shoky> very old but still good
[11:48:52] <jquery514> so i should just return new Dialog
[11:49:12] <shoky> return the new dialog you created, yes
[11:52:52] <jquery514> return this.each(function () {              new $.dialog(this, options, $('#dialog'));         });     still comes with error about .confirm
[11:53:09] <shoky> that's still returning  this.each()
[11:53:16] <shoky> which returns the jquery object
[11:53:25] <shoky> but uh
[11:53:50] <shoky> you're using .each  so that you can run it on multiple elements at once i guess?
[11:54:05] <shoky> doesn't make sense to return the dialog object in that case.. can't return multiple
[11:54:34] <shoky> just do it like in the doc i linked
[11:54:47] <jquery514> shoky: ok thank you
[12:47:22] <jquery514> shoky: done it!!!!!!...your thought please http://jsfiddle.net/exyp6d3L/7/
[13:20:04] <jquery514> how can i determine if agrument is a selector please?
[13:28:01] <sonu_nk> hi there. https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker anyone experience with this lib ?
[13:30:19] <sonu_nk> when i am showing default date using php then its behaving wired.. like i have 10 inputs and each input having its on date value which is coming form database. and i am adding date like "  value="<?php echo $dataVar;?>" .'
[13:31:33] <sonu_nk> its in loop and each input having diff diff value for date.. but when page completely loading then all the datetimepicker input are giving same date which is for 1st input..
[13:44:40] <sonu_nk> i https://imgur.com/a/pLhE4tr
[15:23:08] <jquery046> var test = {"csrf":{"name":"d87be96a430d6b27d6fcd2e0f2e105ea","token":"537f592183e4ae96380c8d39ffb1ee02"}}      now    test.csrf.name should return a value but it doesn't...even test['csrf'] doesnt work
[16:25:00] <aro> if you click on a <p> tag in a form, and draw 'focus' to it, is there a way to select that element based on that?
[16:25:28] <aro> I basically want to detect if someone clicks in the area inside a form i have, whether it is an input element or not
[16:58:58] <pavonia> aro: Can't you just install aclick handler for that <p>?
[17:39:03] <aro> its not just the p
[17:39:07] <aro> its every element in the form
[17:39:14] <aro> i just need to detect if one of them is :active
[17:39:21] <aro> or rather
[17:39:22] <aro> has focus
[18:22:57] <pavonia> aro: Yes, doesn't the p element receive the click due to event propagation?
[18:24:07] <pavonia> Or perhaps something like $("form").on("click", "input", ...) also works
