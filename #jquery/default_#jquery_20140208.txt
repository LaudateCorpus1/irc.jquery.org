[00:01:43] <superphly_> hey guys, I'm back again.
[00:01:53] <superphly_> I'm really close to having a breakthrough moment
[00:02:10] <superphly_> This asynchronous stuff is really hard for me to wrap my head around
[00:02:52] <superphly_> I'm not used to two commands (chains in this case) being executed at the same time
[00:05:28] <superphly_> i'm having a hard time figuring out how to execute some things in order. chaining events I get, but what if I want to execute a function i created before and after a chained sequence?
[00:06:10] <superphly_> I have a "$.each(events, function(i, event) {.......}" that i want to bookend with a timer destroy, timer create
[00:06:24] <superphly_> but $.each doesn't have a callback
[00:45:22] <superphly_> anyone around?
[01:03:33] <brcweggs> Can anyone recommend a solid browser detection plugin?
[01:06:27] <brcweggs> I know it's better to use feature detection instead of browser detection, but I need a way to warn poeple about bugs in certain versions of certain browsers, so feature detection doesn't help much.
[01:28:02] <Whiskey> i try to echo out some text like this $("#Text").append("<span>" + lines[i] + "</span>\n") but it wonÂ´t read the \n
[02:01:09] <greg5green> Whiskey, \n doesn't work as a new line in HTML. try using a <br />
[02:10:54] <ph88> maybe he wants to format the source ^^
[04:02:45] <fattest> does anyone know any jquery animation timelines like this http://3.s3.envato.com/files/79545325/index.html ? I love its animation effects but it only works with twitter API which i dont need for.
[04:20:21] <andrew> hi - if I do $("something").append('<div>....</div>') can I get an object for the appended div
[06:46:41] <Vivekananda> hey everyone why does this seach submit box look very good. when I create it it looks plain and simple http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/LYVQy/3/
[06:47:40] <decx> jquery mobile has a separate css that you have to include
[06:48:09] <decx> afaik, i never used jq mobile much
[06:48:11] <decx> or at all
[06:51:29] <Vivekananda> decx: you mean that css is being included in this code somewhere ?
[06:51:37] <Vivekananda> is it the display:none ?
[06:52:56] <decx> it loads your inline style (... display: none), normalize.css and jquery.mobile-1.2.0.css
[06:53:30] <decx> inline as in, in a <style> not real inline
[06:53:39] <decx> maybe that is real inline
[06:53:41] <decx> i dont know anymore
[07:05:38] <Vivekananda> ok
[08:07:45] <Nephro> How do I make these input fields, that have a shaded label of the field inside the element, but when clicked it disappears
[08:09:31] <cronin> Given this code, http://jsfiddle.net/tjMg4/1/, how can I avoid hiding button 3 when button 1 is clicked. Note, button 1 could have a .btn-hide within the div but in this case it doesn't so it continues to find .btn-hide within the "inner" div, which I don't want.
[08:16:19] <nhqe> use .next()?
[08:20:37] <cronin> next doesn't seem to work. i guess the pseudo code would be: "find .btn-hide unless traversing into another div"
[08:21:03] <blue_warlock> HELLLLOOOOO PEEPSSSSSSSS

[08:29:00] <blue_warlock> use the UI function to validate forms !
[08:29:19] <amarsaini> http://pastebin.com/fEij46J2
[08:29:46] <blue_warlock> use the DOM !
[08:30:03] <amarsaini> instead of this ?
[08:30:04] <blue_warlock> do you want to validate input fields ?
[08:30:08] <amarsaini> no
[08:32:01] <blue_warlock> what do you want to obtain
[08:32:57] <amarsaini> i have 1 input box and 10 checkbox
[08:33:05] <amarsaini> i want to send data via get
[08:33:08] <blue_warlock> the input has data
[08:33:38] <amarsaini> i want to send values for each of 1 input and 10 checkbox such as q=val1+val2_val3 ...
[08:34:00] <blue_warlock> dateaaaaaaaaa
[08:34:18] <blue_warlock> you need to reialize query
[08:34:25] <blue_warlock> serialize
[08:34:51] <amarsaini> but serialize will be i think q1=val1&q2=val2&q3=val3
[08:35:55] <amarsaini> i want all values to a single name
[08:36:53] <blue_warlock> check this post
[08:36:55] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/xrkdA/
[08:37:13] <blue_warlock> it send the values of checkbox to a string
[08:37:27] <blue_warlock> i did it :P
[08:37:57] <blue_warlock> you have to use .map() function
[08:40:34] <amarsaini> ill try map
[08:40:42] <amarsaini> it tried but was not able to do
[08:40:46] <amarsaini> :(
[08:41:12] <blue_warlock> lol
[08:43:57] <blue_warlock> make a fiddle man with HTML
[08:44:04] <blue_warlock> i must see the form structure
[08:44:11] <decx> 'this' in $('parent').on('event','child',fn) is 'child', is there a better way to address 'parent' directly inside the function aside from caching the it into a var beforehand?
[08:55:54] <amarsaini> http://jsfiddle.net/WVp5G/1/
[08:56:02] <amarsaini> blue_warlock
[08:57:33] <blue_warlock> man
[08:57:52] <jedimind> yes
[08:58:40] <blue_warlock> the fields for search must have something to share like the class
[08:59:07] <blue_warlock> then you change values inside check fields
[08:59:08] <amarsaini> share  ?
[08:59:20] <blue_warlock> the must have all the same class
[08:59:29] <blue_warlock> you said they are checkfields ?
[08:59:48] <amarsaini> i have multiple check fields
[09:00:04] <amarsaini> search box is only one
[09:00:13] <amarsaini> i dnt putt in fiddle
[09:00:18] <blue_warlock> post the form structure man
[09:00:46] <blue_warlock> i cant image it
[09:01:08] <blue_warlock> put the html
[09:01:16] <blue_warlock> of form in pastebin
[09:01:31] <jedimind> you're not psychic on saturdays?
[09:01:50] <blue_warlock> wtf im not also in the rest of week :P
[09:04:35] <pragma-> not even on tuesdays?
[09:04:40] <blue_warlock> ah but this is wrong
[09:05:38] <amarsaini> http://jsfiddle.net/WVp5G/3/
[09:05:42] <amarsaini> bkue_warlock
[09:06:05] <decx> ok i found it myself, in $('parent').on('event','childofchildofchild',function(e){ }) you can get the parent with e.delegateTarget
[09:18:22] <_pingu> I search for a reliable way to open a link in a new tab and a new browser window. Tried window.open(url) for new tab and window.open(url,_blank, some options) for new window. That works well in firefox, but not in chrome or ie. in chrome both open new tabs, in ie too, after i change a setting. is there an alternative, maybe a jquery plugin or something, which is reliable and setting independent?
[09:20:09] <blue_warlock> amarsaini the way u use the value its wrong
[09:20:23] <blue_warlock> you must use value to set queries
[09:20:41] <amarsaini> means
[09:21:10] <amarsaini> values to set queries ?how
[09:21:12] <_pingu> right click on a link in these browsers offers open in new tab/window, and it works.
[09:24:20] <blue_warlock> here amarsaini http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/WVp5G/13/
[09:25:00] <blue_warlock> you must work on the values of checkfields
[09:25:07] <blue_warlock> to have the right query
[09:25:54] <blue_warlock> which are your values for queryes ?
[09:26:20] <amarsaini> ithink it should work
[09:26:41] <blue_warlock> tell me which is a query exemple ?
[09:27:23] <amarsaini> fiddle you provided is what i want
[09:27:31] <blue_warlock> but
[09:27:34] <amarsaini> i am trying to intergrate
[09:27:42] <blue_warlock> you should have diferent parameters on query
[09:27:52] <blue_warlock> like
[09:28:16] <blue_warlock> +chk_entertainment=buy+
[09:28:24] <_pingu> no one?
[09:32:58] <amarsaini> no i dont want it that way i only want to pass chk_entertaining to q
[09:33:26] <blue_warlock> infact
[09:34:08] <blue_warlock> if you need to get the id value in the map
[09:34:12] <blue_warlock> $(this).attr('id')
[09:35:11] <blue_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/WVp5G/20/
[09:35:23] <blue_warlock> look this amarsaini
[09:36:58] <amarsaini> i think we can make a hidden input filed with name q
[09:37:11] <amarsaini> and pass all the values to it instead of mainsearch
[09:37:22] <amarsaini> so that is not shown input box
[09:41:01] <x-finite> i want to stop processing jquery code if a certain condition is met, do i have an alternative to return false; as preventdefault and stopropagation doesn't seems to be getting the job done
[09:48:42] <lyscer> is it appropriate to ask a datatables question in here...?
[09:49:18] <vmz> x-finite: If you want to exit currently running function you could just write ```return```
[09:50:19] <Velveeta> x-finite you can also use stopImmediatePropagation() and a return
[09:50:54] <vmz> x-finite: ```preventdefault``` and ```stoppropagation``` are serving their own different purpose which you could see in the documentation
[10:05:54] <mdev> $('a[href"#opened"]').parent('li').addClass('active');
[10:06:08] <mdev> unrecognized expression, trying to set jquery tabs active on page visit
[10:06:27] <Velveeta> you need an equal sign after href
[10:06:27] <mdev> how can the above be fixed? so that myurl.com/test.php#opened
[10:06:32] <mdev> thanks
[10:06:44] <Velveeta> and actually, you should probably make it a *=
[10:07:01] <Velveeta> so it checks partial string match, unless the whole href attribute is just #opened
[10:12:59] <mdev> thanks that fixed my issue but still not getting desired result it loads the page to the tab i want but doesn't show the content of the new tab, shows content of default tab :/
[10:13:15] <mdev> am trying this http://stackoverflow.com/a/11889486
[10:13:48] <Velveeta> i'm not sure how to help past that, as i don't typically use the ui tabs
[10:14:38] <mdev> np i'll figure it, thanks for the help
[10:27:59] <mdev> 'a[href="' + hash +'"]'.tab('show'); works :) using bootstrap so has that nice function in there

[12:51:52] <amarsaini> anybody alive
[12:53:31] <tw2113> what if zombies coded with jQuery, would that discount them?
[12:54:15] <amarsaini> they might not be able to help me out
[12:54:23] <amarsaini> :D
[12:55:32] <amarsaini> tw2113
[12:55:48] <amarsaini> i am not able to modify the action before form submit
[12:55:55] <tw2113> i have faith that zombies could still offer support
[12:57:45] <amarsaini> i am afraid not
[13:12:33] <decx> i have a solution, don't modify the action
[13:13:09] <perldork> interested to hear what your use case is that you'd want to modify the action before submitting â¦
[13:16:10] <perldork> might be an easier pattern to use depending on the scenario you want to implement
[13:18:27] <Tomashe> Hey guys im keeping getting that error on console : body.scrollTop is deprecated in strict mode. Please use 'documentElement.scrollTop' if in strict mode and 'body.scrollTop' only if in quirks mode.
[13:20:01] <Tomashe> im not using any scrict mode or quirks mode
[13:20:25] <mordof> Tomashe: what it's telling you is that you're supposed to target document for scrolling details, not the body element
[13:20:55] <Tomashe> im not targeting body
[13:21:05] <Tomashe> $('html').on("scroll",function(){
[13:21:14] <mordof> Tomashe: so target the document
[13:21:30] <Tomashe> but this isnt even react , i got inside the function { console.log('1') , and nothing comes out
[13:21:43] <Tomashe> im targeting the documenr as i do $("html")
[13:21:51] <mordof> $(document).on("scroll"
[13:22:06] <decx> i always use $(window) for scrolling
[13:22:20] <Tomashe> hmm
[13:22:30] <mordof> decx: yeah, come to think of it i do as well
[13:22:40] <Tomashe> ohh i see
[13:22:40] <mordof> all i'm understanding from tyhat error is that you're targetting something it doesn't like
[13:23:28] <Tomashe> ok and how can i get document . top position since $(document).top isnt really working
[13:23:51] <Tomashe> scrollTop
[13:24:19] <mordof> try window instead
[13:24:28] <Tomashe> ok
[13:24:28] <mordof> as decx pointed out
[13:24:41] <Tomashe> worked like a charm
[13:24:43] <Tomashe> great guys
[13:24:52] <Velveeta> yeah, the html node doesn't have a scroll, and scroll doesn't bubble
[13:25:46] <mordof> question: making a plugin that is communicating to another function via a callback... but i want the plugin to still be chainable. is there a way to make the plugin call delay the chain until the callback returns?
[13:26:57] <Velveeta> nope, you can return a promise for them to chain off of, and resolveWith the same scope, but it won't be the same kind of chaining
[13:27:14] <Velveeta> well, actually
[13:27:33] <Velveeta> provided the callback will execute synchronously, you can execute the callback from within the plugin and then just return this;
[13:27:40] <Velveeta> for chaining purposes
[13:28:08] <mordof> it ultimately isn't synchronous because of an async ajax call.. and i'm hesitant to make it a synchronous ajax call for this purpose..
[13:28:12] <mordof> but i might end up needing to :/
[13:28:39] <Velveeta> what version of jquery are you running?
[13:28:43] <mordof> latest
[13:28:51] <Velveeta> because they did away w/ the async flag several versions back
[13:29:05] <mordof> Velveeta: what do you mean?
[13:29:17] <Velveeta> i mean you can't do async: false anymore on an ajax call
[13:29:22] <mordof> yes you can..
[13:29:23] <Velveeta> they expect you to use the promise interface
[13:29:31] <mordof> sec
[13:29:51] <mordof> oh there it is
[13:29:57] <Velveeta> ahhh i see, it's "deprecated" but not obsoleted yet
[13:30:00] <Velveeta> as of 1.8
[13:30:35] <mordof> it says the use of async false WITH the use of $.Deferred is deprecated
[13:30:58] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[13:30:59] <mordof> it still says i can use the complete/success/error callbacks
[13:31:19] <mordof> so the async false,  $.ajax().done() is deprecated i think it's saying
[13:31:47] <mordof> it's kinda confusing...
[13:31:53] <Velveeta> right
[13:32:04] <Velveeta> but you can still use async: false with success: callback
[13:32:32] <mordof> Velveeta: anyway, async false is a built-in option to XHR... i'd be incredibly shocked if jquery actually took out support for it, when the underlying object has it built into it's core
[13:33:10] <mordof> since xhr ultimately isn't something specific to jquery, but vanilla js - and $.ajax is just a wrapper
[13:33:16] <Velveeta> right
[13:33:32] <Velveeta> i'm currently migrating all of our ui widgets over to a non-chainable architecture
[13:33:42] <Velveeta> all functions will be returning promises instead of chainable scope
[13:33:54] <mordof> what caused that decision?
[13:34:15] <Velveeta> migrating to a more in-depth usage of requestAnimationFrame
[13:34:24] <mordof> h
[13:34:26] <mordof> ah*
[13:34:36] <Velveeta> since you can't be guaranteed that UI updates will be done synchronously anymore, it will resolve it's promise at the end of each animation frame
[13:34:50] <Velveeta> so that you can continue working on any code that's dependent on UI changes being in place
[13:35:10] <mordof> interesting
[13:35:27] <Velveeta> and some functions don't require UI updates, but since i don't want the consumers to have to guess at which ones do and don't, i'm making all public functions have that interface
[13:35:35] <mordof> i'm making a plugin for my classmates... and they haven't been taught the concept of promises, so i'm a bit torn on my current task, heh
[13:35:45] <mordof> Velveeta: that's a good call
[13:35:47] <Velveeta> it'll foster better development practices anyway, embracing the async nature of js
[13:36:21] <Velveeta> yeah i only got acquainted w/ promises a year or 2 ago, and as soon as my brain clicked with them, i started using them all over the place
[13:36:40] <Velveeta> definitely helps mitigate callback hell and organize the code a bit better
[13:36:43] <SpaceSeal> o/
[13:37:06] <Velveeta> and the functions that don't require any async operations will just resolve their deferred objects immediately, but everybody will have to write their code in an async fashion
[13:37:07] <mordof> Velveeta: for sure. i've been using them for a while, and i enjoy it. it's just the target scope of the project... not sure it'd work
[13:37:10] <mordof> asdf
[13:37:11] <hugo_moss> hey velveeta
[13:37:13] <Velveeta> right
[13:37:20] <Velveeta> hey hugo_moss

[13:42:07] <SpaceSeal> but also kno wat to add but too lazy to add it
[13:44:45] <SpaceSeal> ok

[13:45:15] <SpaceSeal> not just value
[13:48:53] <tucan> hi
[13:49:33] <tucan> can someone teach me basic to advanced usage of json?
[13:50:16] <tucan> or maybe code me a demo with like a search box and querying a json data structure or something heh
[13:50:59] <tucan> ive been googling for something similar
[13:51:10] <tucan> not been successful
[13:51:47] <perldork> the jQuery getJSON() API call has a good example in my opinion
[13:51:47] <perldork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[13:53:25] <mordof> tucan: how well do you know javascript in general?
[13:53:42] <tucan> only the very basics
[13:54:00] <mordof> tucan: you should read up on Objects.  json is literally just a javascript object in string form
[13:54:26] <mordof> hence the name: javascript object notation
[13:54:47] <mordof> tucan: it's all just key: value pairs in a container
[13:55:00] <tucan> i kinda know json but not good at searching and manipulating the structure
[13:55:32] <mordof> tucan: json is meant for transferring data - you don't manipulate it (generally) as it is
[13:55:37] <mordof> you convert it to an actual object
[13:56:50] <tucan> my friend was pushing me to use phonegap and it uses jquery and he said to forget about using a database, to just use a gigantic json data structure
[13:57:07] <tucan> im not sure if thats the right way tho
[13:57:10] <mordof> tucan: that HIGHLY depends on the task at hand
[13:57:17] <mordof> security is a large issue in that case
[13:57:49] <tucan> they're just words and translations with a bunch of dictionary attributes
[13:57:51] <mordof> tucan: and the larger the string/data in a json object, the slower your tasks will become unless indexed well
[13:58:25] <perldork> tucan: JSON is just a way to pass data from client to server, it's not a database .. the server has to store the data somewhere, your friend was saying just store the JSON as a file with a big string in it on the server?
[13:59:08] <tucan> well i want offline usage of the app so the data will be downloaded anyway
[13:59:11] <perldork> tucan: mordof is right - that is a path to much pain, there are many databases you can use that are easy to set up that will make everything much easier
[14:00:00] <perldork> You can cache JSON on the client using local storage with HTML 5 for offline use when the client is not connected
[14:00:21] <tucan> hmm
[14:00:51] <tucan> maybe that was why he was suggesting it
[14:01:11] <perldork> a quick google found this as the first hit
[14:01:12] <perldork> https://github.com/kpuputti/JSONCache
[14:01:13] <tucan> i was gonna try sqlite but json should be fine for my project
[14:01:22] <tucan> he said
[14:01:33] <seba4seba> i have a question i am using qtip but i cant find code to disable overlay
[14:03:26] <tucan> im still pretty confused
[14:05:20] <mordof> tucan: how much data are you trying to hold in an object?
[14:05:23] <tucan> whats a good place to learn basic querying of json
[14:05:35] <mordof> tucan: again, you don't query json. it's not a database
[14:05:45] <mordof> tucan: stop thinking about it like that.
[14:06:00] <mordof> tucan: json is a method of transferring data, not storing data
[14:06:03] <Velveeta> you just dereference object paths
[14:06:12] <Velveeta> like path.to.my.property
[14:06:33] <tucan> oh ok
[14:07:14] <Velveeta> example: { name: 'foo', data: [ { id: 1, description: 'bar' }, { id: 2, description: 'baz' } ] }
[14:07:36] <Velveeta> if that were assigned to a 'blah' variable, you could reference blah.name === 'foo'
[14:07:44] <Velveeta> blah.data[0].id === 1
[14:07:46] <Velveeta> etc
[14:08:11] <tucan> yea i want to be good at that type of thing
[14:08:22] <mordof> Velveeta: the problem with tucan's use case isn't so much understanding working with objects, but whether his approach is appropriate for the task at hand.
[14:08:31] <mordof> tucan: just how much data are you trying to store and work with?
[14:08:54] <mordof> Velveeta: he's been told that json is the proper alternative to a database
[14:09:02] <mordof> or a decent alternative.. in his case
[14:09:06] <tucan> well my mysql dump file is about 7,000 Kb which isn't a lot
[14:09:24] <Velveeta> 7 megs?
[14:09:36] <mordof> that certainly is a lot to just be loading on a connecting page
[14:09:41] <tucan> less than 100,000 rows
[14:09:42] <Velveeta> definitely
[14:09:50] <mordof> Velveeta: that being the problem, heh
[14:09:55] <tucan> lol
[14:10:01] <Velveeta> that's not much to deal with in the context of an actual db
[14:10:09] <Velveeta> but when you have to push that to the client, that's a crap-ton
[14:10:18] * mordof nods
[14:12:29] <tucan> he says he still wants me to make a demo of search box and show him that i understand the basic usage of json data structures
[14:12:36] <tucan> where do i learn this though?
[14:12:50] <Velveeta> well that's what i was just going over, traversing a json structure
[14:13:04] <Velveeta> there are really only 2 rules, how to dereference object properties and how to dereference array indexes
[14:13:52] <mordof> tucan: and please be aware - that when you're learning about traversing a "json" structure, it's actually a javascript object, and is no longer json itself
[14:14:23] <mordof> tucan: in order to work with json, it needs to be converted over to an actual javascript object, and then you can access data and work with it
[14:14:46] <Velveeta> right, json is just the string representation of a js object
[14:15:29] <tucan> he literally wants me to have   var j = {"abdominal" : "ë³µë¶ì" };   and have a search box and after clicking search button, just display  the translation
[14:15:32] <mordof> http://blog.pluralsight.com/understanding-javascript-objects-2
[14:15:35] <tucan> but i dont know how
[14:15:46] <mordof> tucan: right - that code you puti s a javascript object, no longer json
[14:15:50] <mordof> read up on that link
[14:15:51] <tucan> oh
[14:16:15] <mordof> tucan: json itself is "let's describe how a javascript object would look, in a way we can send it to someone else"
[14:16:17] <mordof> that's all
[14:16:56] <amh345> i've got a question.  is there a reason why this $( "<div id='test'>"+name+"</div>" ).insertBefore(".group[data-parent-id='" + id +"']").closest(".main"); ignores the closest method but this one works?  $(".group[data-parent-id='" + id +"']").closest(".main").before("<div id='test'>"+name+"</div>");  ?
[14:17:41] <mordof> amh345: order of operations.
[14:17:45] <Velveeta> amh345: because you're telling it to insertBefore that .group selector, that's the selector it's operating on
[14:17:49] <mordof> chaining happens one at a time, not with everything in consideration
[14:18:14] <amh345> ah. so it totally ignore the closest method. because it's "done" before it hits it.
[14:18:19] <mordof> amh345: jquery will look at each command, and run it - regardless of what comes after.
[14:18:21] <mordof> yep
[14:18:29] <amh345> ok. thank you.
[14:18:33] <mordof> so if you want to set something up - it's gotta happen before :)
[14:19:00] <Velveeta> or you have to nest it in extra parens, like you would w/ mathematical order of operations
[14:19:21] <Velveeta> like $('<markup>').insertBefore($('.groupSelector').closest('.main'))
[14:19:36] <mordof> oh, was just going to ask how you'd do that in this case
[14:19:54] <mordof> i don't do that.. i don't like it
[14:19:57] <mordof> it's not entirely clear
[14:20:00] <Velveeta> i don't do that either
[14:20:04] <Velveeta> but that's how it can be done :D
[14:20:04] <mordof> defeats the purpose of chaining in a way
[14:20:06] <mordof> yep
[14:20:09] <mordof> worth noting i suppose
[14:20:58] <mordof> Velveeta: decided there's enough value in keeping everything synchronous that i'm switching it all over
[14:21:02] <mordof> as much as i don't like it... lol
[14:22:20] <Velveeta> well, you can at least use this as a learning experience for your students
[14:22:47] <Velveeta> show them this method, which allows chaining, but the downside is that you have to wait for the request to complete, and your browser is blocked from executing anything else until that happens
[14:23:13] <Velveeta> then you can teach them about deferred and promises, and refactor it to return the promise and show how now you lose chainability, but you gain async task processing
[14:27:20] <mordof> heh, my students - i'm actually in the same classes - but i'm there for the diploma. i'm helping create a project base with my teacher because he was struggling with the programming
[14:27:24] <mordof> he's an html / css guy
[14:27:37] <Velveeta> ahhhh gotcha
[14:27:47] <mordof> uynfortunately i have no say in what gets taught after, and i don't think he fully grasps promises himself to teach it :/
[14:27:49] <Velveeta> well then use it as an opportunity to teach your teacher ;)
[14:27:54] <mordof> hehe, yep
[14:27:57] <mordof> i'm workin on that
[14:28:32] <mordof> won't happen for this class, but it'll help later on i think - and he's interested in learning / doesn't seem like he has trouble being taught by a student
[14:28:34] <mordof> so that's awesome
[14:29:09] <mordof> my project 1 for the semester got replaced with this prep project
[14:29:31] <mordof> special approval for a modification to the course outline for this :D fun stuff
[14:29:35] <Velveeta> well that's good that he's still open to learning himself
[14:29:40] * mordof nods
[14:29:54] <Velveeta> this industry is too explosive in emerging technologies for any of us to feel like we're good enough
[14:30:02] <mordof> oh i know
[14:31:37] <SpaceSeal> mordof,
[14:31:40] <SpaceSeal> come to my site
[14:31:41] <SpaceSeal> :D
[14:31:54] <mordof> SpaceSeal: link?
[14:32:03] <SpaceSeal> upldz.com
[14:32:48] <SpaceSeal> register w a cool foto
[14:33:13] <mordof> huh?
[14:33:23] <mordof> i'm busy and don't want to put in much effort
[14:33:35] <SpaceSeal> omg it asks for 2 things
[14:33:43] <mordof> SpaceSeal: and?
[14:34:00] <SpaceSeal> i need users
[14:34:41] <mordof> SpaceSeal: we're not here to accomodate your user base
[14:35:03] <SpaceSeal> umm?
[15:21:29] <ckj> can anyone recommend a library for skinning a checkbox like an ios style slide toggle?
[15:22:56] <ckj> preferably something css3-based rather than image based
[15:32:51] <sharpy35> Hey i am getting this json as respond: {"success":true} as text!!! but i want to parse it with JSON.parse to a valid json object. IE9 throws me an error: invalid character. anybody know why?
[15:35:32] <sharpy35> anybody ideas?
[15:36:17] <Sam345> Can I query which elements are in the hover state?  I want a keystroke shortcut to take effect based on what the mouse is pointing at.
[15:37:08] <Velveeta> sharpy35: you can try setting your dataType to 'json' to let jquery parse it for you
[15:37:28] <Velveeta> or, i've seen issues before with parsing a json object, where the workaround is to wrap it in a set of square brackets, parse that, and take index 0
[15:37:45] <Velveeta> so JSON.parse('[{"success":true}]')[0]
[15:38:48] <sharpy35> so then my the json text is in a var called answer then it would be
[15:39:08] <sharpy35> JSON.parse('[answer]')[0]?
[15:39:37] <Velveeta> it would be something like this: answer = '[' + answer + ']'; JSON.parse(answer)[0];
[15:40:09] <Velveeta> sam345: you can try something like this: var hoveredEls = $(':hover'), hoverEl = hoverEls[hoverEls.length-1];
[15:40:27] <sharpy35> Velveeta: thx i will try that :)
[15:40:32] <Velveeta> $(':hover') will give you a collection of the lowest level hovered item, up through the html node
[15:40:37] <Velveeta> sharp35: no problemo :)
[15:40:37] <Sam345> Velveeta: thanks, I'll give it a whirl.  I haven't been able to find anything via google
[15:40:52] <Velveeta> sam345: yeah i just went to the jquery site and tried it in my console
[15:41:08] <Velveeta> it'll be ordered from html (index 0) through the lowest level dom node (index N)
[15:41:43] <sharpy35> Velveeta: both didnt work :( still invalid char
[15:41:47] <Velveeta> you can also try just $(':hover').last()
[15:42:11] <Velveeta> sharpy35: damn, are you calling it via $.ajax, or one of the other ajax methods like $.get/post/getJSON/ ?
[15:42:32] <sharpy35> Velveeta: using the Jquery Form Plugin ;)
[15:43:03] <Velveeta> i'm not familiar w/ that plugin, but i'm guessing it handles the ajax request itself internally, so you can't just add the dataType option to it
[15:43:17] <Velveeta> what if you try $.parseJSON instead of JSON.parse() ?
[15:43:34] <sharpy35> i am working together with the Zend Framework 2 and there in a controller action i am returning json. Forn  The reason Ie 9 wants to download the JSON as a file i had to overwrite the response content type and set it to text/plain
[15:43:52] <sharpy35> Velveeta parseJson gives errors in IE
[15:44:07] <sharpy35> therefore they recommended to use JSON.parse();
[15:44:11] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:44:27] <Velveeta> well if it's coming through as text/plain, maybe try trimming it first w/ $.trim
[15:44:39] <Velveeta> i believe if there's any additional whitespace, that'll hose the parser for some stupid reason
[15:44:53] <Velveeta> including \n, \r, \t, or \s
[15:45:44] <sharpy35> i hate ie
[15:46:01] <sharpy35> :( but i am developing for a customer who wants it to be usable with ie7
[15:46:03] <sharpy35> -.-
[15:46:21] <Velveeta> yeah, i still have to support 7 myself
[15:46:43] <sharpy35> thanks for tip Velveeta. i mean 7 is used by 1 % of the mankind... why still supporting it? xD
[15:46:48] <sharpy35> its just a pile of trash
[15:46:55] <Velveeta> it depends on your target audience
[15:47:03] <sharpy35> yeah thats true
[15:47:10] <Velveeta> our company deals with a log of healthcare personnel on legacy machines
[15:47:18] <Velveeta> legal industry tends to be the same way
[15:47:31] <sharpy35> Velveeta but i am thinking of the trimming thing, thats not the best way but a good idea. so thanks for that :)
[15:47:35] <Sam345> Velveeta: $(':hover') seems to work in firefox, but not chromium...
[15:47:49] <Velveeta> now we're still only hovering around 5-10% on IE7 ourselves, even in that legacy user base, but it's enough to maintain support for them for now
[15:48:06] <Velveeta> sam345: hmmm, i'm not sure about chromium, but i ran it in chrome with no problems
[15:48:16] <Velveeta> sharpy35: if it works, it works ;)
[15:48:19] <Sam345> hmm.  From console, with the mouse pointer hovering over the page?
[15:48:29] <Velveeta> yep
[15:48:56] <sharpy35> yeah. i am currently developing a project but i am saying just support the 2 latest IE versions. Even the 9th is just useless. i mean no FileReader API no XHR2 no FormData
[15:49:03] <Sam345> I just keep getting an empty array, even when it's over elements with a :hover background color that highlights
[15:49:19] <Velveeta> interesting
[15:51:06] <Velveeta> yeah i don't have any other ideas outside of the :hover query
[15:51:42] <Velveeta> sharpy35: yeah, my product team is based entirely around jquery ui widgets, but i'd love to be able to use polymer insteadâ¦ can't do that though, until we can, at a minimum, ensure IE9+ for our customers
[15:52:27] <Velveeta> and IE10+ would be even better
[15:52:29] <sharpy35> HA! xD damn old versions ;) The best way would be just to throw away IE xD
[15:52:55] <sharpy35> IE10 is usable its okay IE11 is the best till now. has FILEAPI xh2 formdata and yeah
[15:52:58] <sharpy35> drag n drop
[15:53:03] <sharpy35> and stuff like that
[15:53:13] <Velveeta> yeah, i can understand that a lot of companies have a lot of legacy bs apps internally, and that they'll break with newer versions, that's fine, i get why you don't want your own internal users to upgrade past IE7 or whatever
[15:53:26] <Velveeta> but why, for the love of science, would you not allow them to install a modern browser alongside it
[15:53:47] <Velveeta> they can easily drop in chrome or FF alongside IE7, and have one browser for your legacy apps, and one for the rest of the world
[15:54:34] <sharpy35> Velveeta: imagine a big company with like 10.000 of employees. all using IE7 and Windows XP.
[15:54:51] <sharpy35> you have to update them all at once and this process will take a lot of timne
[15:55:19] <Velveeta> but i'm not advocating a forced update of their systems
[15:55:27] <Velveeta> i only advocate letting them install an additional browser
[15:55:55] <sharpy35> sometimes not possible cuz of security risks :)
[15:56:03] <Velveeta> our customers in some cases have IT depts that won't even allow for extra browsers
[15:56:12] <sharpy35> thats what i meen
[15:56:15] <sharpy35> *mean
[15:56:19] <sharpy35> its totally dumb
[15:56:23] <Velveeta> right
[15:57:20] <sharpy35> but what i cant do right is the relead without cache
[15:57:30] <sharpy35> its totally buggy. sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
[15:58:05] <sharpy35> i mean i bet every webdeveloper is like "we totally love what we do, if there wouldnt be the IE" :D
[15:58:27] <Velveeta> IE makes my job worth more ;)
[15:58:42] <Velveeta> thanks, microsoft and your formerly horrible sentiments about web standards!
[15:58:55] <Velveeta> they at least seem to be playing nice with the world these days
[15:59:31] <Sam345> Webdevelopers! Webdevelopers! Webdevelopers! Webdevelopers!
[16:00:02] <Sam345> I miss Ballmer already :(
[16:00:24] <sharpy35> haha :D i amn stoked what comes next from IE. but it isnt that difficult to read W3C CSS and HTML and JS standards and implement a interpreter like that
[16:00:31] <Sam345> and by that I mean purely for entertainment value, not in terms of company direction ;)
[16:00:33] <sharpy35> i mean all the other browsers getting it
[16:01:49] <Velveeta> yeah, their problem was that they wanted to drive web standards through de jure standards, and the rest of the world didn't buy into a lot of their extensions
[16:02:36] <Velveeta> and the ones that did buy into those vendor-specific implementations they made are now the ones holding back the rest of the internet by requiring legacy browsers
[16:02:40] <sharpy35> But thats what W3c is therefore :D elsewise it wouldnt make any sense
[16:02:58] <Velveeta> oh *i* understand the need for standards :D
[16:03:21] <sharpy35> then please tell the IE CEO :D
[16:03:25] <Velveeta> they were just like <pirate accent> "w3c standards are more whatcha call 'guidelines'"
[16:03:34] <Sam345> yeah, the whole "embrace and extend" does way more harm than good
[16:03:55] <sharpy35> point him with a gun and be like "USE W3C Standards or you will DIEEE" xD
[16:04:52] <SpaceSeal> just try to use standards kay
[16:04:54] <SpaceSeal> thx
[16:04:58] <SpaceSeal> bai
[16:05:17] <decx> eh, we're running into the same problem again as more and more browser get consolidated into webkit/blink, now you've got a mobile -webkit prefix monoculture
[16:05:36] <SpaceSeal> omfg whos this assman
[16:05:45] <SpaceSeal> y u kik me?
[16:06:10] <ryanneufeld> you said bai and didn't leave
[16:06:13] <ryanneufeld> I thought I was helping
[16:06:22] <SpaceSeal> u lil basterd
[16:06:29] <ryanneufeld> watch it
[16:06:43] <ryanneufeld> I didn't ban, you, and it was kinda funny
[16:06:44] <SpaceSeal> were am i looking?
[16:13:24] <sharpy35> ok i am going to bed its 1 am in the morning here :P thanks for the help Velveeta
[16:14:54] <Velveeta> no problem, adios
[16:41:34] <Judge--_> Hello guys. I'm following a KnockoutJS
[16:42:03] <Judge--_> tutorial and the author uses the following syntax to execute his javascript: $( function() { ... }; );
[16:42:18] <Judge--_> Can you please tell me what the $(); means?
[16:44:32] <Sam345> Velveeta: After doing some more googling, it seems :hover is not a valid/documented selector
[16:44:42] <Velveeta> aw boooo
[16:44:47] <Sam345> ie, not listed here http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ but might be supported by the browser itself
[16:45:00] <Velveeta> yeah i never knew if it was cross-browser, i just assumed it was when it worked for me ;)
[16:45:40] <Sam345> is there maybe another way of saying "get me the elements under the mouse cursor" besides hover?
[16:46:46] <Velveeta> you could use mouseenter to constantly track what the currently-active item isâ¦ i think that bubbles also, so you could probably do it with a single listener on the document
[16:46:51] <SpaceSeal> oh Velveeta so ur not a jenius?
[16:46:58] <SpaceSeal> i thot u were jenius
[16:47:18] <Velveeta> var currentEl; $(document).on('mouseenter', '*', function (e) { currentEl = this; });
[16:47:35] <Velveeta> spaceseal: as a matter of fact, i am a genius, but that doesn't mean i know everything
[16:48:00] <SpaceSeal> oh i thot u knew it all
[16:48:11] <SpaceSeal> since u have that billion dolar company
[16:48:35] <Velveeta> just because i work for a billion dollar company, and know more than you do, doesn't mean i know it all.. i know it's a difficult concept for you to grasp, but there it is
[16:49:21] <SpaceSeal> well u didtn know that but i did
[16:49:27] <SpaceSeal> what hapens now?
[16:49:36] <Velveeta> i guess you receive 1 slowclap
[16:49:44] * Velveeta slow claps.
[16:49:48] <Velveeta> don't spend it all in one place
[16:51:58] <chaterz> hi
[16:52:13] <SpaceSeal> pwnt
[16:52:26] <watsup> I want to to make a calender view for a day. An event takes up the entire width of calender, unless theres other events in the same time period then it shares it. I've been stuck for a couple of hours, anyone have an idea of where to look on how to do this?
[16:52:42] <watsup> So like an event is a rectangle.
[16:54:32] <Velveeta> spaceseal: does that seriously constitute a victory of some kind in your head? because if so, you're even more pathetic than i already thoughtâ¦ it's easy to claim you knew something without ever having said anything to begin with, so i'll just continue sitting here assuming you're a moron that's overcompensating for a lack of knowledge in any given topic of relevance
[16:56:06] <Velveeta> watsup: you can try doing it with display table-cell.. outside of that, you're gonna have to use js to count the siblings and manually set the width of each one, if you want them to be equal widths
[16:57:26] <watsup> Hmm, yeah. One of the issues is like if an event lasts 4hours I need the height to be larger than one that is 1hour.
[16:57:40] <watsup> I don't know how I could do that with a table.
[16:57:45] <buddyq> hi guys, I have a site with JUI sliders that are behaving weirdly....
[16:57:56] <Velveeta> ok, so are you saying that the width is split up equally, or do these things tile vertically with varying heights based on length of the event?
[16:58:30] <perldork> hey we've been using datetimepicker which is an extension to jQuery's timepicker - it's been pretty challenging to get it to use the ISO 8601 string format that we get dates back in from our MySQL server .. date translation in general with the time pickers has been a pain, anyone have suggestions for date and time picker plugins they've used that they've found made life easy?  Our servers are in GMT but we display the time/date picker time to the user in t
[16:58:39] <buddyq> Its a range slider. When you move the handles, the entire element slides up and disappears. I am trying to figure out what is firing in Chrom through the dev tools but I don't know how to do that.
[16:58:40] <perldork> sorry jQuery's datepicker
[16:58:56] <watsup> If events overlap in timeframe then they split width equally.
[16:59:21] <Velveeta> perldork: you can try using something like momentjs to do the date parsing for you, and then feed a result from it to your datetimepicker in whatever format it's expecting
[16:59:33] <watsup> so breakfast might be 8am-10am and there might be a phone call at 9am-10am so they'd split width since they overlap at some point.
[16:59:46] <Velveeta> buddyq: i'd have to see a demo of something like that before i could figure out what's going on with it
[16:59:50] <perldork> Velveeta: thanks, will check out momentjs, hadn't heard of that library before
[17:00:07] <Velveeta> perldork: it makes working with dates and times super easy
[17:00:22] <buddyq> Velveeta: I can give you a link in PM if that is okay.
[17:00:29] <buddyq> Its up so you can see it.
[17:00:36] <perldork> Velveeta: checking the project page out now - looks great thank you
[17:00:43] <Velveeta> watsup: you could still do the width splitting via something like display: table-cell, and then calculate your heights independently
[17:00:46] <Velveeta> perldork: no problemo
[17:00:48] <Velveeta> buddyq: go for it
[17:01:10] <watsup> hmm i haven't heard of display: table-cell I'll look into that more, thanks!
[17:01:34] <Judge--_> guys, please
[17:01:42] <Velveeta> if you take a look at bootstrap's components page, you can look for the justified buttons they use
[17:01:47] <Velveeta> which uses that in a similar fashion
[19:37:05] <SpaceSeal> wow
[19:37:16] <SpaceSeal> y computers so strange
[19:38:53] <SpaceSeal> im jus not understand
[19:38:56] <SpaceSeal> very frustrate
[19:39:17] <SpaceSeal> /o\
[19:42:24] <Botango> Hi. How would you animate an element (fontsize and color) for 100 ms, and then reset the style back to it's original value?
[19:42:51] <Botango> As far as I understand you cannot animate classes without using jquery-effects or some extra library
[19:43:25] <Botango> Would you clone the object before changing the style and then grab the original styles from the clone when resetting? Seems a bit expensive
[19:44:32] <Velveeta> you can try using css transitions, and just adding a classing + binding to transitionend to reset the class name
[19:44:47] <Velveeta> classname, not classing
[19:46:27] <Botango> Velveeta: Great idea! Forgot about css transitions..
[19:47:24] <Velveeta> you can set the new font-size + color in a separate class name, set a transition on those, add the class name, bind to transitionend, and then remove the class name
[19:47:52] <Velveeta> it'll cause a transition back, as opposed to an abrupt reset of styles, but so long as your browser support matrix allows for css transitions, it should work
[19:48:04] <Velveeta> i'm not positive that transitions will support font-size and color, but it's worth a shot at least
[19:50:15] <var> Hi... I'm a noob trying to make a slider. Every slider I make loads successfully, but only one can be used. All of them then stop working. What might be the reason?
[19:51:08] <Velveeta> var: i'd have to see a demo of your code to be able to help debug it
[19:52:52] <var> okay thank you, brb
[20:11:54] <var> Velveeta hey if you're still there, what would be the best way to show the code?
[20:12:56] <Velveeta> if you can make a jsfiddle demo or jsbin or something, that would help, otherwise, if there's a live url that i can see it in action, that would help
[22:31:33] <mdev> I use jquery to make ajax posts a lot, when a users session timeouts I have the time redirect thing happen with php, problem is while this works for normal pages with jquery if it's posting data then saving results to a divs html for instance
[22:31:42] <mdev> it just saves the login pages contents there!
[22:32:00] <mdev> any simple way to overcome this?
[22:48:32] <Whiskey> if i have a table, and will select an td in the table i can use eq(x)
[22:48:48] <Whiskey> can i delete every td after td(x) well hide them or anything
[22:59:40] <Whiskey> aha gt(x) awsome =)
[23:01:57] <lonejack> hi to all. I've some prob tu use the replaceWith function. It seems that the document don't change the content after the replaceWith. It seems are necessary a few msec. My problem is that I would like to select the "new" document content at the end of my replaceWith. Any ideas?
[23:04:30] <Velveeta> lonejack: in most modern browsers, you can reference the new content immediately after injection, the only time i've had issues with timing like what you're describing, is in older browsers like IE7
[23:05:11] <VectorX> what is this functionality called where stuff moved around ? http://demo.silocreativo.com/livia/portfolio-list-page/
[23:05:21] <Velveeta> and in those cases, i had to do a visible check on the node in question, because IE doesn't consider (e.g. a table) visible until it's finished injecting and laying itself out
[23:06:41] <Velveeta> vectorx: i have no idea what you're talking about
[23:06:57] <lonejack> Velveeta, it seems I doing a mistake in my code. I re-check  my code.
[23:07:20] <VectorX> like when you click on Dress or Fashion you can see the images rearranging themselves
[23:07:37] <VectorX> is there a particular name for that functionality
[23:07:59] <Velveeta> vectorx: look up 'masonry' or 'isotope'
[23:08:32] <VectorX> there we go
[23:08:36] <Velveeta> :)
[23:12:16] <Velveeta> and now i'm out for the night
[23:13:06] <VectorX> nooooooooooooooooo
