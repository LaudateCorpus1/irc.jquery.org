[04:25:58] <Bluerate>  hi, how to remove required (asterick sign) and error message on field? any advice
[04:39:24] <Cork> Bluerate: are you allowed to modify how the asterick are added to the fields too?
[04:40:11] <Cork> cause if yes, then i would add the astericks as a :before css rule
[04:40:36] <Cork> and use either attribute required or class .required to add it
[04:40:51] <Cork> then you can just remove the attribute required or the class
[06:23:46] <znf> Given a case like this: https://jsfiddle.net/m5496pLy/ - can I somehow tell that my loop is on the first element, without using a counter variable?
[06:23:52] <znf> (does jquery have something internally for that?)
[06:37:54] <Bluerate> Cork: I see but asterick sign makes a field mandatory in database
[07:03:46] <Cork> Bluerate: not by having an asterick no
[07:03:54] <Cork> something else does that
[07:05:17] <Cork> znf: first argument to the callback function
[07:05:23] <Cork> if it is 0 your at the first one
[07:05:28] <Cork> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[07:06:08] <Cork> that is if your looping an array, objects doesn't have a first so there it is no
[07:06:46] <Cork> znf: also you can just do $('p').each no point in going over $.each for dom elements
[07:07:15] <znf> it's an array that contains elements, which I'm building up earlier in the code
[07:07:47] <Cork> ya, i just answered in a generic form
[07:07:56] <znf> indeed, I just took a simpler form to exemplify
[07:08:13] <Cork> simplest is to just do $('p').each(function(i) {})
[07:08:31] <Cork> and the i value will be the position in the array
[07:08:40] <znf> yup, got it, thanks
[13:22:47] <Jasein> Any help with generating a dynamic svg with jquery?
[13:23:05] <robertmaxrees> you'll want a plugin to help with that.
[13:23:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise just use native JS
[13:25:22] <Jasein> do you have a suggestion for such a plugin? I am just trying to draw a simple rectangle with one curvy side.
[13:25:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to search google.
[13:25:52] <Jasein> no problem, thanks for your help.
[13:26:09] <Jasein> I was hoping you were familiar with which ones would work best, but I'll figure it out.
[13:26:34] <robertmaxrees> i personally wouldn't use jquery for this at all.
[13:29:27] <Jasein> Yeah. I wrote my script in plain js, but just used Jquery to attach it to the dom. Was hoping jquery would make accessing the internal parts of an svg easier.
[13:30:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, jquery doesn't really "do" svg
[13:30:47] <Jasein> svg seems like it's got a long ways to go
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> why do you say that??
[13:31:58] <Jasein> disllike the syntax for path being dependent on spaces and commas-seems a little rigid to me. plus there's a lot of repetition, it seems. I am just starting, but it seems bulky.
[13:32:45] <Jasein> it reminds me a lot of turtle
[13:32:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it'
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> *it's XML-based, so of course it's going to be pretty rigid
[13:33:59] <Jasein> maybe that's a better way to say what I dislike about it...it's xml-based.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[13:34:19] <Jasein> bettter than nothing I suppose.
[13:34:24] <robertmaxrees> it's one option.
[13:34:36] <robertmaxrees> there's also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
[14:01:09] <Jasein> This channel used to be so busy all the time. Lots of questions, lots of great conversation. I miss those days.
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we go hit pretty hard by the trolls a while back.  never really recovered.
[14:02:48] <Jasein> Must've missed that. I left for about a year and came back to silence...sucks really.
[14:02:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:03:03] <Jasein> No better way to learn anything than to listen to good solutions to other's problems.
[14:03:08] <robertmaxrees> freenode was under attack for a while.  lots of channels had to lock things down.
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> that and jquery's waning popularity for new projects were a 1-2 punch
[14:04:12] <Jasein> Well, I for one, appreciate having you hear. I try not to take you for granted, but I have learned a shit ton from you and I sincerely appreciate it.
[14:04:19] <Jasein> here.
[14:04:20] <Jasein> sorry.
[14:08:23] <robertmaxrees> :) glad to hear I was helpful!
[15:03:12] <bobloblaw96> when a user clicks the login button in my login form, am i supposed to mock the function that calls the api to authenticate the user?
[15:03:53] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?  you mean for unit tests?  or something else bobloblaw96
[15:04:10] <bobloblaw96> what do you mean
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "am i supposed to mock the function"?
[15:04:30] <robertmaxrees> why would you mock the function?
[15:04:53] <bobloblaw96> i dont know. thats what im asking
[15:05:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't mock functions unless you're doing unit testing.
[15:05:35] <robertmaxrees> unless i'm confused about what you mean by "mock" in this case - could you clarify what you're trying to accomplish?
[15:06:21] <bobloblaw96> when a user clicks login button, do i need to mock the function that handles the form submission to the backend
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> that question still doesn't make sense because the word "mock" is out of place there.
[15:07:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you think "mock" means?
[15:07:05] <bobloblaw96> ok thanks.
[15:07:29] <robertmaxrees> ??
[15:10:12] <robertmaxrees> welp
