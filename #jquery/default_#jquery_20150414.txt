[00:03:54] <jqueryius> [14:54] == JackBauer24 [~JackBauer@89-71-84-205.dynamic.chello.pl] has quit [Client Quit]
[00:03:56] <jqueryius> :(
[00:04:00] <jqueryius> Bauer is on the run
[00:04:02] <jqueryius> yet again
[00:05:03] <jqueryius> $(".answer:visible").each(function(index, element) {
[00:05:20] <jqueryius> console.log($(element).attr('data-suffix'));
[00:05:25] <jqueryius> how come that returns undefined?
[00:05:32] <jqueryius> Am I calling it wrong?
[00:05:42] <Cork> jqueryius: use this not element
[00:06:01] <Uhkis> also, .data('suffix')
[00:06:09] <Cork> $(".answer:visible").each(function() { console.log($(this).dta('suffix')) });
[00:06:25] <Cork> ...
[00:06:30] <Cork> $(".answer:visible").each(function() { console.log($(this).data('suffix')) });
[00:09:30] <vivekananda> Uhkis, when I reach that stage I will have to figure out a way to filter before allowing the user to search
[00:09:54] <vivekananda> right now it is not that big. Could you go back to the earlier suggestion and also anything relevant to the problem I described ?
[00:11:40] <jqueryius> no luck with that cork
[00:12:05] <Cork> jqueryius: console.log($(".answer:visible").length)
[00:12:20] <Cork> i suspect that will be 0
[00:12:35] <jqueryius> I'll try that Cork and see. my html is: <input name="fs1" type="text" class="form-control input-lg fs-task-input" id="stopwatch-seconds" data-suffix="seconds" />
[00:12:41] <jqueryius> oh
[00:12:48] <jqueryius> no its definitely looping
[00:12:48] <luaboy> what does this do ? $("#divmessage").html(tt);
[00:12:55] <jqueryius> because if I do .val() I can see the input value
[00:13:01] <jqueryius> it's just the suffix part that is undefined
[00:13:03] <Cork> luaboy: set the html to the element
[00:13:11] <jqueryius>                     console.log($(this).attr('suffix'));                     console.log($(this).val());                     console.log($(this));
[00:13:17] <jqueryius> only the first one is undefined
[00:13:21] <Cork> jqueryius: data not attr
[00:13:26] <luaboy> Cork:to which element ?
[00:13:35] <Cork> luaboy: divmessage
[00:13:51] <Uhkis> jqueryius: that doesn't even have the answer class
[00:14:02] <Cork> heh ya :)
[00:14:04] <jqueryius> ah damn
[00:34:05] <vivekananda> anyone ?
[00:34:22] <jqueryius> Cork/Uhkis: thanks, that fixed it
[00:35:13] <codedecay-laptop> vivekananda sorry missed your question
[00:35:15] <codedecay-laptop> what was it?
[00:37:09] <ohaibbq> vivekananda: you should show the values when the server responds, rather than on key up
[00:37:56] <vivekananda> codedecay-laptop,  ohaibbq okay , makes sense. so you mean i should move the functionality inside keyup to inside .done() ? for ajax ?
[00:38:41] <vivekananda> codedecay-laptop, the question was -- I have an interesting problem. I have a running autocomplete widget. In it onKeyup I show values. These values are coming from an ajax call to the database. Now what is happening is on typing a little quickly the items in keyup execute but the values haven't been returned yet. so the key expressions think tht there is no such value but it refreshes in a bit. I can workaround this by
[00:38:41] <vivekananda> doing async=false but I want to
[00:38:41] <vivekananda> understand a better way
[00:38:58] <vivekananda> shoot I pasted 3 lines
[00:39:20] <ohaibbq> sounds right vivekananda
[00:39:54] <codedecay-laptop> so you should rate limit your requests, and not use keyup
[00:41:55] <vivekananda> codedecay-laptop, hmmm so I do away with keyp completely then  ? Ny usecase is an autocomplete box. the user is provided possible matches against typed letters.
[00:42:53] <ohaibbq> keyup is fine for initiating the request, but it doesnt make sense to show the results until you have the data from the server
[00:45:34] <luaboy> how do I insert the responsed data into html body to show ?
[00:48:06] <codedecay-laptop> ^ what ohaibbq said, but I wouldn't start the request until 3 chars
[00:48:30] <codedecay-laptop> then you can cache results for the rest of chars
[00:49:12] <codedecay-laptop> invalidate the cache on backspace or delete
[00:49:55] <ohaibbq> cache.. sounds tuff
[00:50:18] <codedecay-laptop> no just assigning the results to a variable and you filter that vs requesting from server
[00:50:28] <codedecay-laptop> until the user changes the request
[00:53:27] <igyiguygyu> Cork: Sorry to bug you again about those cheesy disco lights but… It doesnt really work that well on 135 items :D
[00:54:11] <igyiguygyu> It's like one full column lights up (full <ul>) and some in other column, then again, the first column is the dominant one
[00:54:48] <Cork> igyiguygyu: ya, that is sadly the effect of .random
[00:54:53] <Cork> it isn't really random
[00:55:03] <Cork> computers are quite bad at random stuff :)
[00:55:18] <laloune> hello all, does somebody have a sample of tinymcepopup please
[00:55:51] <igyiguygyu> Cork: but even if I leave var count = Math.round(Math.random() * 1) + 1; it just doesnt get past 6th li element in the first <ul>
[00:56:17] <Cork> igyiguygyu: that count is for how many elements it will mark for each loop
[00:56:30] <Cork> igyiguygyu: you want to modify the position random
[00:56:38] <Cork> (to match the number of elements you have)
[00:57:26] <igyiguygyu> Oh, that seemed to work, sort of!
[00:57:31] <igyiguygyu> Thanks :)
[01:05:01] <Omar-> how to override anonymous function in widget factory?
[01:05:10] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/cb53f4n6/
[01:05:21] <Omar-> _destory is the anon function
[01:05:31] <Omar-> i'm unable to override it
[01:07:39] <igyiguygyu> and what if I would want to do fadeIn on the append and fadeOut when it disappears, is that possible? Tried to add .fadeIn (.append(<div>).fadeIn(1500); and nothing really changed

[01:17:10] <marcusdei> hi guys
[01:17:12] <marcusdei> this page
[01:17:15] <marcusdei> http://easywebsite.nl/voorbeeld/fortune/weather/
[01:17:27] <marcusdei> the element on the right
[01:17:31] <marcusdei> you can enter your own city
[01:17:44] <marcusdei> and it will open the weather of that city in a new page
[01:17:54] <marcusdei> but I want some overlay text in that box
[01:18:05] <marcusdei> something like, "enter your city"
[01:26:23] <Cork> marcusdei: use placeholder=""
[01:26:51] <marcusdei> yes, but with jQuery ?
[01:28:17] <marcusdei> nm, think i found it
[01:30:43] <marcusdei> ok, I've used this $(".wu-autocomplete.ui-autocomplete-input").attr("placeholder", "Type here to search");
[01:30:49] <marcusdei> but it doesn't add the placeholder
[01:30:52] <marcusdei> any tips for me?
[01:30:57] <marcusdei> append an id??
[01:34:07] <Arcarc> How do I add both $('a').smoothScroll(); and $('#datepicker').datepicker(); to $(function() { ... });?
[01:34:14] <Arcarc> Only the first one will work
[01:35:11] <Cork> Arcarc: should work just find
[01:35:22] <Cork> just add them on separate lines in the function
[01:36:24] <Arcarc> That's what I thought too, but I'm no expert
[01:36:33] <Arcarc> This is the code: http://hastebin.com/osusexafiv.coffee
[01:36:58] <Arcarc> Only smoothscroll work, unless I change their order, where only datepicker works
[01:37:00] <Cork> ya, that's just fine
[01:37:15] <Cork> .coffee might be the cause though
[01:37:36] <Arcarc> Possibly the lack of coffee by my desk
[01:37:39] <Cork> check the generated js to make sure it doesn't add some annoying crap
[01:38:30] <marcusdei> ok, so this worked for me
[01:38:31] <marcusdei> $(".wu-autocomplete").attr("placeholder", "Type here to search");
[01:38:55] <Cork> marcusdei: just set it in the element
[01:38:59] <Cork> no need to do it in code
[01:39:08] <Cork> * in the html
[01:39:18] <Schabo> I have a $.ajax query that triggers the .fail function instead of .done even though the request completes correctly. I can't figure out why it does that. Can anyone help me out with this?
[01:39:59] <Cork> Schabo: check the arguments i think the third is the reason
[01:40:11] <Cork> it most likely is a code or parser error
[01:40:27] <Schabo> The third argument of what?
[01:40:39] <Cork> .fail
[01:41:46] <Schabo> Only argument for .fail is the returned data
[01:41:57] <Cork> no
[01:42:09] <Cork> none of the .fail arguments are the returned data
[01:42:33] <nafur> Hi! I have some draggable elements and some other library that reacts whenever the user drags such an element. Now I have changed the positions of these elements manually (via elem.css()) and want to simulate this dragging...
[01:43:07] <Cork> Schabo: fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {})
[01:43:23] <nafur> However, I can't figure out what I have to do to make this work. as of now, I'm trying elem.trigger("mousedown"); elem.trigger("click"); but this doesn't seem to do the trick...
[01:43:30] <Schabo> I have this .fail( function(data) ) {
[01:43:51] <Cork> well data is the xhr object
[01:44:01] <Schabo> yes
[01:44:01] <Cork> and you just haven't named the two other values
[01:44:27] <Schabo> Right, I'll check what they have to say. Thanks
[01:45:07] <alphazulu> is there any good address/location autocomplete that doesn't use google maps api?
[01:45:34] <Cork> i think nokia have one
[01:46:33] <Cork> ah... its... shutdown by microsoft...
[01:46:51] <alphazulu> yeah just saw that :-(
[01:47:21] <Cork> open maps might have something
[01:48:04] <Cork> http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Api
[01:49:20] <alphazulu> actually now am checking http://sphinxsearch.com/wiki/doku.php?id=php_api_docs
[01:50:09] <Schabo> Cork, It's giving me an parse error, so the request goes correct but it can't parse the reply. Thanks for the help! Now I know where to look further.
[01:51:05] <KAT> hi, I need advice. How to solve that problem: I need some kind of fallback for images which doesn`t exists. If image under URL-A doesn`t exists than load that image from URL-B.
[01:51:12] <KAT> How I can solve that good?
[01:51:38] <KAT> I know I can use jQuery and onError event on img tags, but I am not sure it is a good way to solve it
[01:51:45] <Cork> KAT: you would have to find the error event on the image
[01:52:08] <KAT> is that solution browser compatible? I need it on mobile devices too
[01:52:11] <Cork> and if the image fails to load replace it with an img tag for urlb
[01:52:27] <Cork> yes, you have to replace the img tag for it to work in webkit though
[01:52:35] <Cork> if you just change the url the error handler doesn't fire again
[01:53:11] <KAT> ok, thx
[01:54:41] <Arcarc> I need more input on this odd issue: http://pastebin.com/LaUE38GN
[01:54:56] <Arcarc> $(function()) only reads the first line or something
[01:55:00] <KAT> http://www.paulund.co.uk/handle-image-loading-errors-with-jquery looks promising
[01:55:19] <nafur> Can anyone help me with my draggable problem?
[02:06:59] <kfpJQ> Hi guys, I am using the validation plugin for a small form, however when validating a select box. one of the values is 'Title' to help fill the form out but obviously with the 'required' rule it counts this as a value. How do I overcome this
[02:06:59] <kfpJQ> ?
[02:07:40] <Cork> kfpJQ: i told you this yesterday set the make the value value="" instead of value="default"
[02:08:40] <nafur> Hi, I want to kind of simulate dragging an element
[02:08:46] <kfpJQ> Sorry Cork I must of missed that. Apologies
[02:09:02] <nafur> Can anyone tell me which exact events jquery uses to implement draggable?
[02:09:33] <Cork> nafur: it uses the mousedown and mousemove events
[02:10:03] <nafur> Can I just simulate this by elem.trigger("mousedown"); elem.trigger("mousemove"); ?
[02:10:09] <Cork> no
[02:10:34] <Cork> not sure you can actually get the draggable to work with simulating events
[02:11:22] <nafur> Ok, so the setting is this: I have draggable elements and at some point I want to reposition the manually (think of a graph layouting). However, another library takes care of rendering the actual graph (-> jsPlumb).
[02:12:18] <nafur> Now, after the repositioning, this other library still has some offsets stored internally. While I can't make it to properly recompute these offsets, dragging an element will fix this. So I'd like to emit a "fake dragging event" for each element...
[02:12:37] <nafur> Do you have any idea how to do this?
[02:27:16] <clu3> i'm using jquery-ui and yet i only use jquery datepicker. I see some themes they come with all the CSS for all jqueryui plugins. Is there away to download the CSS for datepicker only?
[02:28:29] <Cork> clu3: ui reuses the same styles for all widgets
[02:28:45] <Cork> so there isn't really that much that is datepicker specific
[02:28:52] <clu3> i see
[02:29:01] <Cork> so you would prob have to edit the css file you're self
[02:29:12] <Cork> (you don't have to use the themes at all if you don't want to)
[02:29:35] <clu3> default theme (base) does not work with datepicker plugin ,if i do not use any theme
[02:29:57] <clu3> so i think i HAVE to, otherwise i'll end up customizing my own theme
[02:30:02] <Uhkis> you're actually better off theming it yourself, jquery ui looks really outdated
[02:31:41] <clu3> @Uhkis, i wish i could
[02:31:44] <clu3> i'm not a CSS gu
[02:31:46] <clu3> i'm not a CSS guy
[02:33:52] <marahin> Hey guise! I'm a JS & jquery newbie. I have an issue, where I declared two functions and I call them from $( document ).ready(). However, only one of the functions execute, and the other one (containing only an .append() call) doesn't execute, and neither passes an error. If I copy the code into one function, everything executes except the .append code, which is in the 2nd function. Code: https://gist.github.com/Marahin/d6063e170cd2d4
[02:33:53] <marahin> c6aac0
[02:33:56] <marahin> woops
[02:34:14] <marahin>  https://gist.github.com/Marahin/d6063e170cd2d4c6aac0
[02:34:25] <marahin> Any help will be appreciated, not sure what's wrong :(
[02:38:30] <Uhkis> my guess is: servers is not defined
[02:39:24] <marahin> Uhkis: wouldn't it throw an error then?
[02:39:33] <marahin> unless servers is empty, huh
[02:40:07] <marahin> well, Servers is filled as soon as parse_servers() runs. Doesn't add_servers() wait for it to finish?
[02:45:16] <Uhkis> i'm gonna go ahead and say no, since you're not using .done
[02:46:30] <Cork> marcusdei: ya, you most likely want to use deferred and $.when
[02:46:42] <Cork> (instead of the servers array you use now)
[02:49:20] <marahin> Cork: tab mistake :)
[02:49:42] <Cork> ouch
[02:50:26] <Cork> marahin: http://jsfiddle.net/ypun189d/
[02:50:29] <Cork> something like that should work
[02:51:13] <marahin> whoah! I didn't know that there's such thing as .when() method
[02:51:20] <marahin> Cork: where should I put it?
[02:51:39] <marahin> inside the $( document ).ready() directive?
[02:51:41] <Cork> marahin: where the code calls parse_servers today
[02:51:46] <marahin> okay
[02:51:52] <Cork> and it should also replace the add_servers
[02:52:02] <Cork> as that is done with the .done call
[02:52:32] <Cork> marahin: parse_servers returns an array of deferred objects now
[02:52:47] <Cork> and .when will wait for all of them to return value
[02:52:53] <Cork> and then call the function .done points to
[02:53:25] <Cork> and (here is where i'm not 100% sure) the first argument to that function is an array of all the return values
[02:53:38] <Cork> also notice the parse_servers use .then
[02:53:43] <marahin> I see. However, is the >data< argument function add_servers requires passed automagically by .done()?
[02:53:48] <Cork> that is to convert the data to a new Server
[02:54:01] <Cork> marahin: yes
[02:54:20] <Cork> marahin: that is the main point of using $.when
[02:54:26] <marahin> I see :D
[02:54:31] <marahin> Dang I am amazed by all of this
[02:54:41] <marahin> Cork: thank you very much, I'm gonna check it out now
[02:54:54] <Cork> marahin: expect it not to work, it is untested >_>
[02:54:59] <Cork> but the concept is correct
[02:59:39] <marahin> Cork: works out of the box. Thank you very much! :D
[02:59:48] <Cork> heh
[02:59:49] <Cork> np
[03:00:02] <Cork> man i always get scared when things like that happens...
[03:00:26] <Uhkis> where is that .call() from?

[03:00:45] <Cork> ugg, thx
[03:00:55] <Cork> marahin: that line is wrong
[03:01:07] <Uhkis> oh it's plain js
[03:01:13] <Cork> marahin: it should have been $.where.apply(null, parse_servers())
[03:01:48] <marahin> so   $.where(null, parse_servers()).done(add_servers);
[03:01:50] <marahin> Cork: ^

[03:14:23] <chargen> Hi. How can I access a function that's on the parent iframe from the child if they are in different domains? I'm looking for a JSONP example but I can't find one.
[03:14:38] <marahin> Cork: haha no worries, trying it out now
[03:15:19] <Cork> too much sql i guess >_>
[03:15:30] <Cork> chargen: you can't
[03:15:56] <Cork> chargen: or let me rephrase that; it would be a security bug if you managed to do it
[03:17:06] <chargen> Cork: for what is jsonp used then?
[03:17:25] <Cork> chargen: to load json data from a third party
[03:17:36] <Cork> but it will still run in your site, not there
[03:17:55] <Cork> you could load there js file with a <script> tag
[03:18:02] <Cork> but you still won't be able to do xss with it
[03:18:13] <Cork> (execute the function in there site)
[03:19:35] <chargen> There's any workaround or is simply impossible?
[03:19:54] <Cork> by design impossible
[03:20:12] <Cork> like i said it would be a security hole (called xss) if you ever found a way around it
[03:20:50] <chargen> ok, thanks for the explanation :)
[03:21:19] <Cork> chargen: there are some iframe services that provides explicit api to do this
[03:21:33] <Cork> chargen: but then it is handled through sendMessage
[03:21:42] <Cork> and the server side have to explicitly implement this support
[03:21:52] <Cork> sorry not server side, the "iframe site"
[03:22:14] <chargen> I have access to both sites

[03:22:36] <Cork> have a look at that then
[03:22:45] <chargen> ok thanks!
[03:22:58] <Cork> chargen: make sure to implement the proper safe guards though
[03:23:22] <Cork> as any site can post you a message through that interface (as long as it is loaded in the users browser)

[03:26:08] <_2_goody> hi
[03:29:22] <vivekananda> anyone here got a little time. I dont have a jquery question but I hope someone can help
[03:29:29] <Cork> ?ask
[03:29:29] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:31:33] <vivekananda> Cork, I would but it is not jquery and this channel is anyways. I am trying to get google login to work. on step 8 of this link ---https://developers.google.com/+/web/signin/server-side-flow  . I cannot understand where they are getting those variables from eg $request. It is not the global and the morons didn't document anytihng to help
[03:31:41] <vivekananda> didn't comment I mean
[03:32:24] <Cork> vivekananda: ya, for google questions you should ask in there channel (though i think it is normally quite dead)
[03:32:32] <Cork> it is offtopic for this channel
[03:41:25] <vivekananda> Cork, lol. I guessed as much that is why I asked before my question
[03:58:14] <Meir`> vivekananda, i'll answer you shortly because it's off-topic. the examples in google documentation are incomplete  code snippets
[03:58:49] <Meir`> "$request" and other variables are part of Symfony, which is used in those examples
[04:00:12] <Meir`> if you work without any php frameworks, have a look here: https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/php

[04:55:14] <Guest58994> anybody have experience with dataTables? i wanted to put inputs in my table, but i see that when i submit them they are erased (they disappear from POST, and GET appears twice - first time okay and second blank: eg. index.php?ataTables_Table_0_length=10&string=cheese&string=&s=submit. is it possible to seperate my form values from dataTable's functionality?
[05:54:23] <kk_drop> I would like to run function in interval, but for the first time I would like to have small value, and then a lot bigger value. just would like to user will not be waiting for first function call
[05:55:07] <Cork> kk_drop: use setTimeout and adjust the "number" as your function get called
[05:56:03] <kk_drop> ah right, tx!

[06:30:33] <MajorTennis> Hey I'm having trouble formatting a datepicker
[06:30:39] <MajorTennis> http://paste.ee/p/hFpg8
[06:31:17] <MajorTennis> can anyone see where I should put the dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' bit?
[06:34:51] <Cork> MajorTennis: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[06:35:19] <MajorTennis> I have spent some time there
[06:35:40] <MajorTennis> I think my issue may have been trying to use a semi colon
[06:35:44] <MajorTennis> when I needed a comma
[06:36:14] <MajorTennis> because beforeShow is in there too
[06:38:09] <Dr-007> what does "use strict" do?
[06:38:11] <MajorTennis> no longer breaks the rest of the file with the comma but I'm not getting the desired format hmmm
[06:40:37] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode @ Dr-007
[06:41:02] <Dr-007> thanks
[06:51:39] <printForever> can anyone tell me where is this slider from? http://i.imgur.com/9drczzn.png I've seen it before, but I can't remember where. tnx!
[06:53:06] <islalobo> I'm trying to get a div to toggle based on the value of radio button if checked :http://jsfiddle.net/rspb8z0p/
[06:53:51] <Cork> islalobo: why not just use css?
[06:54:34] <islalobo> Cork and the radio buttons?
[06:56:23] <Cork> islalobo: http://jsfiddle.net/rspb8z0p/2/
[06:57:08] <islalobo> Thanks Cork!
[06:57:10] <islalobo> Cork++
[06:59:24] <islalobo> Hrm, but that doesn't work when I add it to my css
[06:59:35] <Cork> islalobo: the dom structure matters a lot
[06:59:59] <Cork> so you might not be able to do it is the div isn't a sibling or a child of a sibling
[07:00:12] <Cork> uh, you won't; not might :)
[07:01:04] <islalobo> A child of the radio buttons?
[07:01:25] <Cork> no a sibling or a child to a sibling
[07:01:38] <Cork> (the selector will differ between those two)
[07:02:45] <VanReyes> Hi everyone, for keyup event. how to trigger after inputting many digits. Because it always trigger every after keyup. I want to trigger write after inputing words
[07:03:08] <VanReyes> right after*
[07:05:05] <Cork> islalobo: if the structure prevents the css solution you can use: http://jsfiddle.net/rspb8z0p/3/
[07:05:34] <gauravmak> Hi, I want to check if any element with data-rel exists in DOM. How do I do that?
[07:05:36] <Cork> VanReyes: use input instead of keyup
[07:06:01] <arthurvr> gauravmak: write the selector as usual and check for its length
[07:06:01] <Cork> gauravmak: that is quite expensive but $('[data-rel]')
[07:06:03] <islalobo> Cork, the structure is more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/on61mwy3/1/ (sorry for all the divs and long selectors, we use drupal)
[07:06:21] <gauravmak> data-rel attribute I mean
[07:06:23] <Cork> islalobo: ya, i know drupal love divs
[07:06:33] <Cork> gauravmak: what i gave you is an attribute selector
[07:06:53] <Cork> islalobo: ok, so you have to use the second solution
[07:07:05] <Cork> cause css can't do that selection
[07:07:14] <Cork> islalobo: http://jsfiddle.net/rspb8z0p/3/
[07:08:19] <gauravmak> Cork, is this proper? - $('[data-rel="chosen"],[rel="chosen"]').chosen();
[07:08:36] <Cork> gauravmak: yes
[07:08:48] <gauravmak> Actually, error is occuring if there is no element with [data-rel="chosen"] in DOM :(
[07:08:52] <Cork> except for .chosen
[07:08:54] <islalobo> Cork Sweet!
[07:09:02] <Cork> that isn't a default method of jquery
[07:09:26] <Cork> gauravmak: sounds like .chosen isn't written correctly then
[07:09:28] <gauravmak> Yeah, thats a plugin. So, what can I do to avoid the error in that case?
[07:09:50] <Cork> the plugin should have used this.each(function() {}); around its inner code
[07:09:56] <marcusdei> hi guys
[07:09:56] <Cork> if it had this wouldn't have caused an error
[07:10:01] <marcusdei> can someone help me with this form here
[07:10:05] <marcusdei> http://easywebsite.nl/vergelijk/thuiszorg/
[07:10:12] <gauravmak> I see. Thanks, Cork. I will check that.
[07:10:14] <marcusdei> when I click the 'verder'button
[07:10:16] <printForever>  can anyone tell me where is this slider from? http://i.imgur.com/9drczzn.png I've seen it before, but I can't remember where. tnx!
[07:10:27] <marcusdei> the form jumps higher
[07:10:36] <marcusdei> scrolls itself to top
[07:10:42] <marcusdei> how to turn this off?
[07:11:23] <islalobo> Cork++
[07:11:27] <islalobo> That works great
[07:11:41] <Cork> sweet
[07:26:12] <mdoge> hi, every time I do $(obj).attr('src', 'images.png'), it actually fetches a new image. Can I make it use the cache instead?
[07:26:30] <mdoge> same goes for $(obj).css('background-image', 'images.png');
[07:26:45] <mdoge> do I need to preload the images?
[07:26:48] <mdoge> does that help?
[07:30:36] <blinky_> Hi all, got an odd one if someone could help.  I am trying to get the id of an option from a datalist, I am using this code and it works on fiddle without issue - http://jsfiddle.net/1ev23y88/ - however, when I transfer the code over to my site and mix it with a little php I get issues.  If there is only a first name and a single phone number it will fail to pull the id on my site, here is the code - http://pastie.org/10091914
[07:30:59] <blinky_> Any ideas why I can not pull the id if the details are not complete?
[07:37:48] <Meir`> blinky_, i didn't understand why you defined the var "clientGet" the way you did
[07:41:01] <blinky_> Meir`: To be completly honest with you I found the script online, I am trying to get it to work for my project.  I do not have a very good understanding of JS yet but am trying to learn.
[07:41:43] <blinky_> Meir`: All I require is to be able to pull the ID that is set for each option within the datalist
[07:41:45] <Meir`> just figured out you can't use :selected on datalist
[07:42:25] <blinky_> Meir`: Datalist are causing me a few problems at the moment trying to get the ID's
[07:43:01] <Meir`> blinky_, can you pastebin the source code of the page after it loaded?
[07:43:50] <blinky_> Meir`: Here you go - http://pastie.org/10091929
[07:45:11] <Meir`> blinky_, can you add "\n" in the php loop?
[07:45:15] <Meir`> it all got in one line
[07:46:59] <blinky_> Meir`: Here you go - http://pastie.org/10091933
[07:49:10] <Meir`> blinky_
[07:49:16] <Meir`> looks like this is the issue: var g=$('input[type="text"]').val();
[07:49:21] <blinky_> Meir`: Yes mate
[07:49:36] <blinky_> Meir`: ok
[07:49:40] <Meir`> you better to select a specific input
[07:49:49] <Meir`> by id perhaps
[07:49:59] <blinky_> Meir`: Any ideas how?
[07:50:09] <Meir`> (unless you'll tell me the console.log was correct)
[07:51:28] <Meir`> simply add id inside this tag: <input type='text' list='clients' placeholder='Client Search' /><br />
[07:51:38] <blinky_> Meir`: If I use id 44 for instance then I will get a console log of 44 for the clientGet, if however, I use ID 56 I get undefined for clientGet
[07:52:41] <Meir`> blinky_, i mean the first console.log, which should output the text search value
[07:53:10] <Meir`> anyway, add something like: id='clientSearch'
[07:53:10] <blinky_> Meir`: Sorry yes the console log for g output the contents of the option
[07:53:16] <Meir`> inside that tag
[07:53:31] <Meir`> and then replace: var g=$('input[type="text"]').val();
[07:53:45] <Meir`> with: var g=$('input#clientSearch').val();
[07:54:16] <Meir`> that's a very basic thing, even if it has nothing to do with your issue
[07:54:20] <NoiseEee> if there's really an ID you can skip the 'input'
[07:54:57] <Meir`> NoiseEee, that's right. I usually keep it only for clearance
[07:55:32] <blinky_> Meir`: I have done as you suggest but still the same
[07:55:50] <Meir`> ok, another possible thing can be the trim
[07:55:57] <Meir`> if you compare two strings
[07:56:09] <Meir`> you better trim they both, or none of them
[07:56:33] <Meir`> so you can replace: return $.trim( $(this).text() ) === g;
[07:56:41] <Meir`> with: return $.trim( $(this).text() ) === $.trim(g);
[07:57:43] <Meir`> i'm pretty sure it will solve it
[07:57:56] <Meir`> because i saw several items in the data list that end with space
[07:58:02] <Meir`> and trim removes this space
[07:58:21] <blinky_> Meir`: Still the same, outputs the contents of the option but shows undefined for the clientGet.  Is there not a way of just collecting the id from the datalist->option?
[07:58:47] <Meir`> like this one: <option id=33>Arla - Mikolaj Pietrzyk - 0158963215 - </option>
[07:59:30] <blinky_> Meir`: yeah this will happen I am afraid, we are trying to train the staff to get both landline and mobile numbers but some client don't give both.
[08:00:05] <blinky_> Meir`: See id 33 will work fine, it will collect the id and send it to the ajax without issue
[08:00:25] <blinky_> Meir`: But id 56 will show as undefined
[08:02:24] <Meir`> blinky_, it's something with the spaces for sure
[08:03:01] <Meir`> in the html of id 56, there are two spaces between "Damian" and the dash
[08:03:23] <Meir`> but when you select it, in the input text it turns to one space
[08:03:44] <Meir`> are you forced to use datalist?
[08:04:52] <blinky_> Meir`: I don't know any other way of being able to populate a list from teh database and search it.  I have updated the jsfiddle to show the problem, select teh second item on the list and click the button - http://jsfiddle.net/1ev23y88/1/
[08:05:00] <Meir`> i, personally, hate this element
[08:05:10] <blinky_> Meir`: I am beginning to understand why
[08:05:22] <Meir`> well, there's jquery autocomplete
[08:05:42] <Meir`> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[08:06:00] <Meir`> and there's another option
[08:06:09] <Meir`> if you don't want extra scripts
[08:06:23] <Meir`> to insert the option id into some global variable
[08:06:48] <Meir`> and then, when click the #button, to use that variable
[08:07:05] <Meir`> i'll update your fiddle
[08:07:14] <blinky_> Meir`: your a star
[08:14:14] <Meir`> blinky_, never mind, i got it to work
[08:14:26] <Meir`> you used this.text instead of this.value
[08:14:40] <Meir`> and that manipulate spaces differently
[08:14:42] <Meir`> http://jsfiddle.net/1ev23y88/2/
[08:14:57] <Meir`> have a look, i used your original list items from the pastebin
[08:16:37] <blinky_> Meir`: Mate thank you very much, really thanks, I have had people looking at this problem for a while now, thank you very much.
[08:17:18] <Meir`> blinky_, actually perhaps it's because i changed the selector for the filter
[08:17:32] <Meir`> because i see it works also with this.text
[08:17:34] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, that's using the implicit value for each option.
[08:17:45] <robertmaxrees> you should really give each option a value.
[08:18:09] <Meir`> +1 to robertmaxrees
[08:18:49] <Meir`> <option id=56 value="Allied Bakeries - Damian  - 01234523665 - ">
[08:18:50] <blinky_> So would the option->value be the same as the id then?
[08:18:56] <blinky_> oh
[08:18:56] <Meir`> will output same result as yours
[08:19:27] <Meir`> no need for closing tag </option>
[08:19:43] <blinky_> Will give that a try now
[08:19:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd still include the closing tag, but thats just me,.
[08:20:03] <Meir`> <option />
[08:20:09] <Meir`> maybe this way looks better
[08:20:28] <robertmaxrees> it can't be self-closing since it has a textnode.
[08:22:00] <Meir`> well, iirc, i have read once that one can feel free to ignore html5 standards for certain purposes
[08:22:14] <Meir`> i even think it was written somewhere in  jquery docs
[08:22:15] <robertmaxrees> i would never ignore the standard for any purpose.
[08:22:32] <robertmaxrees> especially when it comes to self-closing tags.  that's inviting cross-browser pain.
[08:22:35] <Meir`> maybe jquery mobile
[08:22:55] <robertmaxrees> doing <option /> optiontext would be the same as <option></option> optiontext
[08:22:59] <Meir`> something about nesting a tag inside another tag
[08:23:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd never let browsers try and figure out what i meant.
[08:23:31] <robertmaxrees> be explicit and save yourself the headaches :)
[08:23:34] <Meir`> yeah, you probably right
[08:24:50] <blinky_> so place the </option> on the end yeah?
[08:24:57] <Meir`> yeah
[08:25:11] <ericP> if i have some node set like [ <e a="1">, <e a="2">, <e a="3"> ], how do i restrict it to [ <e a="2"> ] ?
[08:25:27] <blinky_> Thanks to both, works a treat.
[08:25:30] <robertmaxrees> ericP are you working with XML or HTML?
[08:25:33] <ericP> i'm looking for the opposite of not("a=2")
[08:25:51] <Meir`> np blinky_
[08:26:21] <ericP> robertmaxrees, xhtml
[08:26:22] <robertmaxrees> ericP there's .filter()
[08:26:47] <ericP> filter takes a function instead of a "a=2" thingy, right?
[08:26:56] <Meir`> yeah
[08:26:57] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[08:27:07] <robertmaxrees> it takes a selector, a function, DOM elements...
[08:27:15] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of stuff.
[08:27:38] <robertmaxrees> the "a=2" thingy is called a selector, ericP
[08:27:39] <ericP> ahh, tx
[08:27:48] <robertmaxrees> though that's not how you normally use them.
[08:27:56] <ericP> robertmaxrees, what's the result of a selector, a selection?
[08:28:13] <robertmaxrees> depends on the method/function :)
[08:28:20] <ericP> (yeah, i should have written "[a=2]"
[08:28:23] <ericP> )
[08:28:53] <robertmaxrees> $('#someID'); returns a jQuery object.
[08:29:04] <robertmaxrees> others return raw DOM nodes.
[08:29:05] <ericP> that's what i meant -- tx!
[08:29:17] <ericP> (the jquery obj)
[08:44:46] <PCatinean> what is the minimal library for a datepicker?
[08:44:53] <PCatinean> trying to reduce bloatware as much as possible
[08:45:19] <robertmaxrees> you mean the jquery ui datepicker?
[08:46:00] <PCatinean> whatever datepicker as long as it's small robertmaxrees
[08:46:08] <PCatinean> and takes as little code/resources as possible
[08:47:33] <robertmaxrees> check ut something like http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2010/07/27/creating-cross-browser-html5-forms-now-using-modernizr-webforms2-and-html5widgets-2/
[08:47:44] <robertmaxrees> look into polyfills for the HTML5 datepicker, basically.
[08:48:11] <PCatinean> html5? it's not supported by older browser
[08:48:15] <MajorTennis> formatted dates to dd-mm-yy and its not sorting correctly presumably because its assuming its american format. has anyone encountered this
[08:48:21] <MajorTennis> anyone british :D ?
[08:48:22] <robertmaxrees> hence the polyfill, PCatinean
[08:48:59] <robertmaxrees> MajorTennis sorting correctly where?
[08:49:49] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean http://tests-anciens.ljouhet.net/webshims/ is another option for a polyfill.
[08:51:59] <MajorTennis> robertmaxrees, in my table
[08:52:21] <robertmaxrees> MajorTennis huh?  are you using datatables or something?
[08:52:25] <MajorTennis> yeah
[08:52:29] <MajorTennis> class="sort"
[08:53:10] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  https://datatables.net/blog/2014-12-18 looks like you might need this?
[08:53:56] <MajorTennis> cheers its like its assuming american format and considering the days months
[08:54:01] <MajorTennis> in some bits
[08:54:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not ncessarily assuming american format.
[08:54:25] <robertmaxrees> it has to do with the underlying date object in javascript.
[08:54:38] <robertmaxrees> and how it expects input, which IS "american format"
[08:54:43] <MajorTennis> I like how in office space how his entire job is just amking the year fields in databases 4 characters
[08:55:04] <MajorTennis> good movie
[09:06:35] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having some trouble getting a modal to work from nav menu. The modal toggle is working but the grey transparent overlay isn't dissapearing. http://jsfiddle.net/wkc5md23/19/
[09:06:46] <checkit> I tried following this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26697851/bootstrap-modal-not-working-in-dropdown-menu
[09:09:42] <cjohnson> and?
[09:10:06] <cjohnson> what was the result of your attempt?
[09:12:57] <checkit> cjohnson: Me?
[09:26:41] <Meir`> checkit, actually your fiddle preview looks empty for me in Chrome, but works well in IE
[09:27:06] <Meir`> without leaving any grey transparent overlay
[09:30:40] <Meir`> checkit, i removed the "collapse" class from the navbar div, and now it's displayed also in Chrome, and again, the fiddle works well
[09:31:36] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having some trouble getting a modal to work from nav menu. The modal toggle is working but the grey transparent overlay isn't dissapearing. http://jsfiddle.net/wkc5md23/19/

[09:51:19] <hrusti> http://jsfiddle.net/ebRXw/263/
[09:51:55] <ImACow2> (IT php dev) because I do slow API backend calls, I serve the page to the user and I will load the extra stuff with ajax. now I read that I should not wait for ready but just go ahead and load the ajax data while the page is "loading" right ? this does prevent me from putting jquery.js at the bottom of the page right ?
[09:52:19] <hrusti> why event handler doesnt work if I minimize window to collapse buttons ?
[09:52:42] <robertmaxrees> hrusti try using event delegation instead?
[09:53:17] <robertmaxrees> ImACow2 you'll need to put jquery.js in the head and then your code after.
[09:53:41] <robertmaxrees> hrusti also, you have jquery included twice in that fiddlel.
[09:57:01] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: ok I will. I didnt set up fiddle I just alter it :)
[09:58:20] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: I have to iterate with each() function. Is this possible with  delegation?
[10:00:30] <robertmaxrees> hrusti why do you need to enumerate?
[10:01:37] <hrusti> robertmaxrees long story :)
[10:01:45] <robertmaxrees> it's relevant.
[10:01:49] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to.
[10:01:58] <robertmaxrees> you just need one delegated listener.
[10:01:59] <robertmaxrees> not many.
[10:03:52] <cjohnson> checkit: of course you. you said "I tried following this" and then never explained the result of your attmempt to try following it
[10:04:09] <cjohnson> how did you follow it? do you have a jsfiddle where you implemented that solution? what were the results? error? confusing behavior? etc
[10:04:14] <robertmaxrees> hrusti http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ebRXw/266/
[10:04:25] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: I have to iterate through all buttons in table and call another (magnificPopup) plugin like $(this).magnificPopup(options). If I do this in delegated listener I nothing happens
[10:04:42] <hrusti> -I
[10:05:02] <robertmaxrees> hrusti don't bind your listener at the same time you're initializing magnific, then.
[10:05:19] <robertmaxrees> but if magnific just needs a class, you probably don't need .each() through all of them.
[10:07:17] <hrusti> robertmaxrees I have data in html data attribute so I have to iterate through buttons, read data and pass it to magnificPopup plugin. So each button has custom data, thats what I have to .each through
[10:07:36] <hrusti> dont I? do you have better solution?
[10:07:48] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then don't bind the listener at the same time.
[10:08:48] <hrusti> robertmaxrees: I dont know what you mean by that

[10:17:36] <hrusti> robertmaxrees ok I saw that. If I initialize plugin in click function nothing happend because I forgot to call show function after initialization. thakns
[10:19:29] <hrusti> robertmaxrees but why dont they call clone(true) when they clone element in plugin so that data and events also get cloned?
[10:19:47] <hrusti> is this bad practice? why?
[10:19:55] <robertmaxrees> memory overhead i'm guessing.
[10:20:11] <robertmaxrees> they're popups - they should be relatively simple bits of markup.
[10:20:57] <decx> more like poopups amirite
[10:21:05] <decx> sorry
[10:21:05] <robertmaxrees> #yolo
[10:25:24] <jayd3e> with pjax, are there any reasons why it is important to bind to the $(document)?  Or can I bind to the parent that contains the links that will result in a reload?
[10:28:55] <robertmaxrees> doens't pjax replace the entire body?
[10:29:04] <robertmaxrees> or just the contents of a particular container?
[10:31:09] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having some trouble getting a modal to work from nav menu. The modal toggle is working but the grey transparent overlay isn't dissapearing. http://jsfiddle.net/wkc5md23/19/
[10:31:13] <checkit> I tried following this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26697851/bootstrap-modal-not-working-in-dropdown-menu
[10:31:38] <robertmaxrees> checkit you've asked that question three times and ignored multiple responses to it.
[10:32:10] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Not intentionally.. I'm getting kicked... Something's up w/ our office internet today. Sorry guys...
[10:32:27] <checkit> So I haven't seen any of the repsonses.
[10:32:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?  i'm not seeing any part messages from you.
[10:33:24] <checkit> I know... I'm not sure what's going on... Internet will hang and hang and hang and then pick up right where I left it. But I'm missing all feed activity.
[10:33:37] <robertmaxrees> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20150414.log.html#t10:29:37 logs are here.
[10:34:07] <checkit> Awesome... Ty robertmaxrees
[10:35:07] <decx> colons in ids work?
[10:35:41] <robertmaxrees> decx in html5 they do
[10:35:50] <decx> well everything works there
[10:35:58] <decx> so that IS a new thing
[11:17:59] <blinky_> Could someone have a look at this and tell me why the div named "content2" does not reload please - http://pastie.org/10092371
[11:19:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:19:28] <robertmaxrees> .reload()?
[11:20:25] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ what do you expect that to do?
[11:20:26] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: I am trying .reload() and .load()
[11:20:32] <robertmaxrees> reload() isn't a thing.
[11:20:55] <tasaif> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_loc_reload.asp
[11:21:10] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: I would like just the content2 div to reload, I am collecting data from the database and storing it into a session, I then need to reload teh div to display the data without reloading the page
[11:21:15] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1. don't use w3schools.
[11:21:28] <robertmaxrees> 2. that's location.reload(), not a jquery method.
[11:21:38] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ you need to use .load() to do thta.
[11:21:41] <tasaif> 3. it's a thing
[11:21:44] <blinky_> tasaif: location.reload() reloads the entire screen, I need to only reload a div not the entire screen
[11:21:51] <robertmaxrees> tasaif you know what i mean.
[11:22:00] <tasaif> blinky_: robertmaxrees is helping you
[11:22:14] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ $("#content2").load("../../includes/proceduresDisplay.php #content2"); something like this is what you want.
[11:28:40] <dhelm> Anyone know how to set and unset a pin (fixed position) on an element with ScrollMagic on window resize? It’s a responsive site and it’s leaving a gap where the pinned navigation was when I resize the window to the mobile view.
[11:30:05] <robertmaxrees> is it fine on pageload?
[11:30:10] <dhelm> yes
[11:30:55] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't put much thught into it personally, then - most users won't resize their window down that small.  otherwise, link to docs?
[11:32:40] <dhelm> it’s really more for demo purposes. http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/docs/   thanks @robertmaxrees
[11:32:59] <dhelm> any help would be much appreciated!
[11:37:24] <robertmaxrees> http://janpaepke.github.io/ScrollMagic/docs/ScrollMagic.Scene.html#removePin
[11:38:20] <dhelm> thanks, but I already tried that and couldn’t get it working. I’m pretty new at Javascript, so it’s very possible that I coded it wrong.
[11:39:02] <robertmaxrees> what part wouldn't work
[11:40:08] <dhelm> the pin no longer worked, but it’s maybe just the resize part I’m having troulble with. How would you set it up?
[11:40:14] <dhelm> Can we chat in another window?
[11:40:24] <robertmaxrees> !paste @dhelm
[11:40:27] <b-ot> dhelm: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:40:31] <robertmaxrees> no need to chat elsewhere.
[11:40:33] <robertmaxrees> just show some code.
[11:41:26] <dhelm> ok, I’ll try to put something together really quick. thanks!
[11:45:37] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=oAm5KCJADx
[11:46:37] <robertmaxrees> where's the resize code?
[11:46:43] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: Cheers got that part working now, thanks a lot
[11:47:16] <dhelm> it’s using the debounce function for performance. EventListener on resize
[11:47:55] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[11:48:24] <robertmaxrees> so part of your problem is you're re-running the scrollmagic stuff over and over and over, even if you don't need to.
[11:48:43] <dhelm> yeah… I realize that’s part of the problem
[11:49:11] <dhelm> like I said, I’m new at js
[11:49:38] <dhelm> I can pay you for help though. Just trying to learn.
[11:49:46] <robertmaxrees> we don't do that here :)
[11:50:23] <tocka> hi guys, just wanted to ask has anyone had a problem with jquery validate only validating dynamically added fields
[11:50:31] <tocka> only 2 fields are being validated basically..
[11:50:42] <robertmaxrees> dhelm so it looks like you always want the scene to get initialized, right?
[11:50:44] <tocka> if I add any more they are just being ignored.. any ideas why?
[11:50:45] <tocka> :o
[11:51:00] <robertmaxrees> tocka because you need to init the validator after you add all fields.
[11:51:07] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: actually, I only need it for the desktop layout
[11:51:11] <robertmaxrees> there might be a way to add fiels after initialization, i can't remember.
[11:51:24] <tocka> robertmaxrees good point... but the fields are being added by the user :o
[11:51:38] <tocka> so when the button "add field" is being clicked I should reenable validation?
[11:51:41] <robertmaxrees> tocka okay?  what does that change... ;)
[11:51:45] <tocka> hehe
[11:51:45] <tocka> :D
[11:51:51] <tocka> thanks <3
[11:51:55] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the docs to see how you can add new fields.
[11:53:12] <robertmaxrees> dhelm you could try something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/qvi2ylm/#url=3apxw15
[11:55:26] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: thank you, but it has the same issue with the gap
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> i'm just pointing you in a direction.
[11:55:48] <robertmaxrees> did you see what i changed?
[11:56:44] <Latorre> http://jsfiddle.net/gtjvok9g/
[11:56:47] <dhelm> yes, would a link to the site help?
[11:57:00] <robertmaxrees> a minimal test case would be best.
[11:57:12] <Latorre> why of commented lines works perfect, but if I try to do it dinamic with each function show me gauge is undefined
[11:57:13] <robertmaxrees> i also don't know the plugin, so thta doesn't help.
[11:57:16] <Latorre> ?
[11:57:53] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: ok, thanks. I’ll work on a test case.
[11:57:59] <robertmaxrees> Latorre where does it tell you gauge is undefined?
[11:58:09] <robertmaxrees> dhelm you should read http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[11:58:56] <Latorre> console log
[11:59:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:59:20] <robertmaxrees> what line does the stack trace tell you?
[11:59:24] <Latorre> is doing the same of both ways?
[11:59:35] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: cool, I’m looking over it now. thanks!
[11:59:40] <robertmaxrees> Latorre not necessarily, no.
[12:00:23] <Latorre> what do you suggest me for fix it ?
[12:00:41] <robertmaxrees> Latorre i don't understand what line is broken so i don't know what to suggest.
[12:00:52] <robertmaxrees> what line does the console tell you is broken?
[12:03:03] <Latorre> TypeError: this.variable is undefined
[12:03:10] <Latorre> 	  var gauge = new RGraph.Gauge('mod'+value['id']+'', 0, this.variable.muestra.mues...
[12:03:29] <robertmaxrees> Latorre oh, that's because 'this' changes.
[12:04:26] <Latorre> so, what IK must to do?
[12:04:44] <robertmaxrees> something like http://fixee.org/paste/7u64uga/
[12:05:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you setting that to this.variable though?
[12:06:31] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: did you ever set initialized to true? I can’t see it anywhere
[12:06:47] <Latorre> robertmaxrees ; now show me this ;;; TypeError: this.canvas is null
[12:06:55] <Latorre> 	  this.context           = this.canvas.getContext ? this.canvas.getContext("2d") :...
[12:07:26] <robertmaxrees> dhelm probably not.  you might need to fix that.
[12:07:35] <robertmaxrees> Latorre...
[12:07:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:07:49] <robertmaxrees> context is important.
[12:07:56] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you need to do the same thing.
[12:09:10] <Latorre> robertmaxrees ; that's inside the plugin library?
[12:09:18] <robertmaxrees> Latorre what plugin?
[12:09:28] <Latorre> rgraph
[12:09:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you're asking me.
[12:10:23] <Latorre> robertmaxrees ; http://www.rgraph.net/docs/starting-with-rgraph.html#structure
[12:10:36] <dhelm> robertmaxrees: you defintely pointed me in the right direction and for that I’m very grateful. I have it unsetting the pin now when I resize the window, so now it’s just a matter of getting it to unset at the right breakpoint. Thank you so much!
[12:10:39] <robertmaxrees> Latorre this doesn't tell me anything about your code.
[12:10:46] <robertmaxrees> dhelm++ glad to hear!
[12:10:58] <Latorre> I'm working with this plugin and I need to set dinamically the graphs
[12:11:27] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Latorre
[12:11:27] <b-ot> Latorre: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:11:51] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:12:03] <Latorre> http://fixee.org/paste/wg42nwv/
[12:12:09] <Latorre> this is my script
[12:13:23] <Latorre> If I leave it fixed works perfect, but I need to clone that structure for to do it dinamically with the response of post function
[12:14:31] <randomguy1> is 'presentation' supossed to be mispelled?
[12:14:41] <randomguy1> just bugging me...
[12:14:42] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:15:17] <randomguy1> 'presentacion/AdministracionPresentacion.php'
[12:15:35] <robertmaxrees> different language probably
[12:15:45] <randomguy1> k
[12:16:17] <robertmaxrees> "administracion" would be a good clue.sae with "muestra", "nomre" etc ;)
[12:16:23] <robertmaxrees> Latorre okay - your stafck trace should tell you where your error is coming from with your code.
[12:38:30] <ehlovader> anyone around that could help me with datatables? I am having a hard time finding settings and extensions that aren't for pre 1.10.
[12:38:40] <ehlovader> I want bootstrap styled pagination but also want the first and last buttons
[12:38:47] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:38:57] <ehlovader> when I do full_numbers style pagination it goes to default styles,
[12:39:32] <ehlovader> can't tell if it is an issue with https://github.com/Jowin/Datatables-Bootstrap3 or if it is an issue with datatables ,or with my config.
[12:40:05] <printForever> ok, I'm getting really frustrated with this
[12:40:23] <printForever> I'm getting too much recursion
[12:40:36] <printForever> when including jQuery plugin Calx
[12:40:40] <printForever> https://github.com/xsanisty/jquery-calx
[12:40:57] <printForever> i tried loading regular and minified versions
[12:41:05] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[12:41:11] <printForever> both locally and remotely but every time there is an error
[12:41:18] <printForever> robertmaxrees, fiddle what?
[12:41:22] <printForever> its a plugin...
[12:41:31] <printForever> I haven't changed anything
[12:41:33] <robertmaxrees> you can load plugins into fiddles.
[12:41:41] <robertmaxrees> can you show us a polace it's broken?
[12:41:45] <robertmaxrees> *place
[12:43:02] <printForever> https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4259829/7144871/9a1221a8-e2e8-11e4-9bf0-07443fc23c6e.jpg
[12:43:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[12:43:22] <printForever> you can imagine how I feel when I get that message
[12:43:37] <robertmaxrees> a screenshot != a place for me to see the error in action.
[12:43:54] <printForever> how can I show you the error in action?
[12:44:00] <printForever> I need to fiddle entire website?
[12:44:12] <robertmaxrees> are you able to create a minimal html page that shows the error happening?
[12:44:16] <robertmaxrees> cna you share the website?
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> anything.
[12:44:24] <printForever> ...
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tLhrdc1q/ is fine.  no errors.
[12:47:47] <mdoge> how do I add '.append('”')' ?
[12:47:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:47:57] <mdoge> (im trying to add quotes)
[12:48:00] <mdoge> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark
[12:48:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to append quotes to a string?
[12:48:17] <mdoge> starting and ending quotation marks
[12:48:19] <mdoge> yes
[12:48:37] <printForever> robertmaxrees, could it be because there are other plugins being loaded on the page as well?
[12:48:52] <robertmaxrees> printForever yep.  things can conflict.
[12:49:02] <mdoge> robertmaxrees: this comes up in the result: Â€Œ
[12:49:11] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ mdoge
[12:49:11] <b-ot> mdoge: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:49:13] <mdoge> some utf8 garbage
[12:49:18] <mdoge> ok
[12:49:28] <robertmaxrees> ooooh.
[12:49:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to escape the character
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> do you need the "smart" ones, or the plain onese?
[12:50:56] <mdoge> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/t2ctw03m/
[12:51:09] <randomguy1> http://jsfiddle.net/u49x8cvq/
[12:51:10] <mdoge> robertmaxrees: actually that does work there -_-
[12:51:33] <robertmaxrees> randomguy1 the issue is encoding, not the basic task :)
[12:51:45] <robertmaxrees> mdoge make sure the page encoding isn't something weird.
[12:51:50] <randomguy1> oh, is the " a special "?
[12:52:04] <robertmaxrees> looks like he's using the special typographic ones, etc.
[12:52:06] <robertmaxrees> *yeah
[12:52:29] <mdoge> robertmaxrees: Content-Type: text/html
[12:52:34] <mdoge> do I need some kind of
[12:52:38] <mdoge> encoding server header
[12:53:04] <randomguy1> i think robert is talking about the charset
[12:53:05] <ehlovader> in the datatables issue I mentioned when I set sPaginationType to full_numbers it appears as this https://i.imgur.com/xdUPwsm.png
[12:53:15] <ehlovader> by default it works and show up like https://i.imgur.com/9pkQTZj.png
[12:53:29] <robertmaxrees> that's content type, not encoding - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encodings_in_HTML for more.
[12:53:43] <ehlovader> if I set bs_full it shows up in some horrible hybrid https://i.imgur.com/1YG2SXA.png
[12:53:47] <ehlovader> with no numbers
[12:53:49] <robertmaxrees> ehlovader you might have more luck in the datatables forums.
[12:53:56] <mdoge> robertmaxrees: ah damn it, I just went into vim on the server and pasted the quotes there, it works now. Looks like my IDE just uploads it wrong ;/
[12:54:06] <ehlovader> I was hoping not to mess with those, but thanks robertmaxrees
[12:54:12] <mdoge> thanks robertmaxrees
[12:54:14] <robertmaxrees> ehlovader mess with what?
[12:54:19] <ehlovader> the forums
[12:54:20] <ehlovader> they seem a mess
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> ehlovader they should be ok.  what you're asking is pretty specific to Datatables so you're more likely to get help there probably.
[12:54:58] <ehlovader> perhaps I am jaded, I have found forums lately to be poorly organized and full of repeats, old unrelevant data and mangled code snippets. datatables forum is no different
[12:55:21] <ehlovader> yeah, thanks, tried #datatables here and #datatables.net which I saw mentioned but nothing ...
[12:55:26] <ehlovader> I will give the forum a try.
[12:55:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i asked them to make a channel long ago and they refused to.
[12:55:50] <ehlovader> yup, saw that post
[12:55:51] <ehlovader> lol
[12:56:06] <robertmaxrees> kind of strange imo, but whatevs.
[12:56:12] <ehlovader> was hoping... but half their code snippets were mangled by a string replace
[12:56:22] <ehlovader> injecting anchor tag links into them
[12:56:35] <ehlovader> others were just mangled into oblivion https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/4122/what-and-where-iam-doing-wrong-with-server-side-pagination#
[12:56:35] <robertmaxrees> ouch
[12:57:13] <ehlovader> here is the one with an injected link to the legacy docs https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/9279/bootstrap-pagination-first-and-last-buttons
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> woah - code formatter is busted.
[12:57:17] <ehlovader> causing javascript errors
[12:57:44] <ehlovader> in the code not on the site...
[12:57:47] <randomguy1> l8r all, clock says i'm almost free, :D
[12:58:04] <ehlovader> anyway, it reminds me of xda forums or wordpress plugin forums... two places I hate having to turn to for help;
[12:58:10] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:58:41] <ehlovader> long long threads, lots of old data, denvercoder9 situations and such https://m.xkcd.com/979/
[12:59:05] <ehlovader> thanks though robertmaxrees for the help.
[12:59:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah - sorry i couldn't do/say more.
[12:59:22] <ehlovader> you don't by chance have a recommended table system that is better than datatables do you?
[12:59:46] <ehlovader> it seems clunky but works so well, and seems to be what we have for providing really good tables
[12:59:47] <robertmaxrees> nope.  then again i think needing a solution like that in a web page is a little much in the first place ;)
[13:00:26] <ehlovader> well just an internal system. I wanted to provide record table pages, which offered more than just a straight listing
[13:00:35] <printForever> robertmaxrees
[13:00:41] <printForever> is there a way I can isolate plugins
[13:00:53] <robertmaxrees> ehlovader i'd probably just hand roll at that point, but i'm crazy.
[13:01:03] <robertmaxrees> printForever not sure i follow.  they should isolate on their own.
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> did you figure out what's causing your headaches?
[13:01:31] <ehlovader> actually using a laravel datatable package, along with many bootstrap and feature datatables bower packages.
[13:02:58] <ehlovader> this is the use case for my table... so you would roll your own sorting paging, export, render, rowlink etc.? https://i.imgur.com/WjHEeLp.png
[13:03:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> that's actually not too complex imo.
[13:03:44] <ehlovader> not really, it is integrated, but I wanted it to be more user friendly...
[13:03:57] <tocka> hi guys
[13:04:01] <tocka> could someone help me with http://jsfiddle.net/fontnk8r/4/
[13:04:02] <ehlovader> all the save state stuff, and ajaxy I guess
[13:04:11] <tocka> $(this) is being returned as undefined
[13:04:11] <tocka> :(
[13:04:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:04:39] <Zeranoe> Are there any examples of hiding and displaying different content in a page based on a currently selected item in a drop down <select>?
[13:04:54] <robertmaxrees> tocka no, $(this).attr('name') is.
[13:05:10] <robertmaxrees> actually, console.log($(this).attr("nane"));
[13:05:14] <dan_j> Is anyone aware of a mobile friendly select box plugin? Similar to Chosen
[13:05:58] <tocka> robertmaxrees thanks :D
[13:06:03] <tocka> silly me :|
[13:06:08] <ehlovader> tocka you may have better luck with properties than attributes on checkboxes ... https://jsfiddle.net/fontnk8r/6/
[13:06:29] <robertmaxrees> you should generally use .prop() instead of .attr(), yes.
[13:06:37] <tocka> ehlovader thanks! was about to change that
[13:06:37] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I'm removing one by one
[13:06:46] <ehlovader> dan_j

[13:06:59] <tocka> robertmaxrees is there a particular reason to use prop instead of attr?
[13:07:09] <ehlovader> it triggers native selects on mobile
[13:07:19] <Zeranoe> Are there any examples of hiding and displaying different content in a page based on a currently selected item in a drop down <select>?
[13:07:48] <printForever> robertmaxrees, nope... the error is still there, I disabled everything else
[13:07:59] <ehlovader> tocka http://stackoverflow.com/a/5876747/704765
[13:08:15] <robertmaxrees> printForever i setup a basic HTML page that included jquery and your plugin and everything seemed fine.
[13:08:16] <robertmaxrees> no errors.
[13:08:23] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe no, but that's pretty trivial.
[13:08:41] <tocka> ehlovader thanks
[13:08:41] <tocka> :)
[13:10:16] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Should I use the onchange in <select> or just jquery the whole thing
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> never use inline js
[13:10:44] <dan_j> ehlovader: Thanks. I saw that and will probably have to use that. I was wondering if there is one which includes filtering.as you type, like chosen.
[13:10:53] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: So staight jquery .change(), sweet thanks
[13:11:17] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe or .on('change', function() {});
[13:11:19] <robertmaxrees> either/or
[13:11:23] <ehlovader> dan_j the problem with filter as you type in mobile is that the keyboard takes up some of the screen.
[13:11:38] <ehlovader> I haven't seen any that work well with the screen being eaten up by an unknown sized keybaord
[13:11:52] <ehlovader> that is why often it is just best to rely on native selects imho
[13:11:55] <dan_j> True. Just trying to work out what to do. Its a big list.
[13:12:35] <ehlovader> on screen selects will sometimes be hidden or unusable on mobile becuase of the nature of touch, scroll , and that damn keyboard.
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> just do a plain search.
[13:13:09] <ehlovader> you might look into what jquery mobile does with its lists... that is probably the closest to a good solution
[13:13:23] <ehlovader> but that comes with a lot of cruft just for that feature
[13:15:09] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:15:48] <robertmaxrees> hello
[13:16:00] <Azrael_-> i'm adding an object with .append to the dom and i want to make it invisible based on a int. can i do this in a nice way within the append?
[13:16:17] <robertmaxrees> based on a number, you mean?
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd create the node first and conditionally set styles based on that, THEN append it.
[13:17:18] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Any idea how i can do .show() .hide() different content based on the selected option?
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe ...yes?  it's pretty simple.  not sure what you're lost on.
[13:18:51] <Zeranoe> How to get the current selected option
[13:19:10] <robertmaxrees> $(this).val();
[13:19:45] <tasaif> Zeranoe: http://jsfiddle.net/hg90gmf5/
[13:19:53] <Azrael_-> hmmm, ok
[13:21:09] <Azrael_-> robertmaxrees: can i use hide() on nodes which aren't in the dom yet, or how did you mean to set styles to hide it?
[13:21:19] <robertmaxrees> set styles to hide it.
[13:21:24] <robertmaxrees> like, add a class.
[13:21:26] <robertmaxrees> or use .css()
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4m1agjud/ i'd do something like this.
[13:22:22] <dan_j> ehlovader: Ok, thanks. I'll scrap the idea.
[13:22:32] <ehlovader> don't scrap it
[13:22:35] <ehlovader> make it happen
[13:22:38] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Super clean, thank you. I like that
[13:22:42] <ehlovader> it is actually a common problem I think
[13:22:44] <ehlovader> I have run into it
[13:23:22] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Though, why didn't you choose to use .show() .hide() ?
[13:23:22] <ehlovader> it would be neat if you could put in a search string and then it opens native select with filtered options
[13:24:37] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe that way i can specify classes myself and customize things more.
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> really depends on how your site is laid out and what all you need.
[13:25:51] <vivekananda> hi everyone
[13:30:00] <ehlovader> oh yeah, I was reminded why the forums like that are horrible when I filled in the ask a question thing robertmaxrees
[13:30:02] <Zeranoe> Is there any way to activate a tab if a certain key is pressed? If the user hits '+', I would like to initiate a tab so the next field is selected.
[13:30:06] <ehlovader> there is one massive category for free users
[13:30:25] <robertmaxrees> "activate a tab" meaning...
[13:30:35] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe like the keypress?
[13:30:37] <ehlovader> its like constantly tossing fresh fruit into a compost bin...
[13:31:03] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: Yes, if the user is imputing + into a field, it causes a tab
[13:31:32] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe sure.  check out e.preventDefault() and .focus()
[13:38:21] <tasaif> Zeranoe: http://jsfiddle.net/q4Lk2s5j/
[13:47:54] <Zeranoe> tasaif: What is that supposed to do?
[13:48:33] <tasaif> it focuses on the next input element when you press +
[13:48:35] <printForever> the plugin is constnatly throwing errors
[13:48:43] <printForever> even if I remove all plugins
[13:48:46] <printForever> and he is the only one
[13:49:02] <printForever> I still get "too much recursion"
[13:49:47] <Zeranoe> tasaif: Hm, that doesn't seem to work for me?
[13:50:10] <tasaif> + in the numpad
[13:50:15] <Zeranoe> tasaif: Ah, on the number pad it works... What about the overhead numbers? Where did you find the code?
[13:50:55] <fas3r> Hello
[13:50:57] <printForever> tasaif, are you familiar with this error?
[13:53:36] <tasaif> Zeranoe: http://jsfiddle.net/q4Lk2s5j/1/
[13:53:41] <tasaif> next to my crippling self doubt
[13:54:11] <tasaif> printForever: what plugin?
[13:54:18] <printForever> Calx
[13:54:57] <printForever>  i tried loading regular and minified versions both locally and remotely but every time there is an error
[13:56:47] <tasaif> printForever: they don't use a cdn do they?
[13:56:58] <printForever> nope
[14:00:40] <fas3r> I have 2 div,  A and B. I'm using detach and appendto to move the content of div A to div B and the other way around by 2 function. But when I try to move back the content of div A ( which is in div B ), it doesnot do anything. Do I have to do something to keep/update the event of the content ?   here is the code http://pastebin.com/LvtdQeTa  if you have any clue that would be welcome :):
[14:01:08] <fas3r> thanks by advance.
[14:03:00] <tasaif> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/bbfttugf/
[14:03:14] <tasaif> I'm not getting anything just by including it, what did you do next to make it give you an error?
[14:05:09] <tasaif> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/bbfttugf/1/
[14:05:11] <tasaif> that's their sample
[14:05:18] <tasaif> I'm not sure what it's supposed to do, but I'm not getting errors
[14:07:20] <printForever> tasif... what could I try to debug it?
[14:07:48] <tasaif> fas3r: http://jsfiddle.net/pcakayra/
[14:08:03] <tasaif> that doesn't look like it works at all
[14:08:59] <tasaif> but you should probably bind to the parent container instead of the elements that you're moving around. I think they lose their listeners when you move them.
[14:09:21] <tasaif> printForever: what's the error?
[14:09:52] <tasaif> tasaif*
[14:09:54] <printForever> too much recursion

[14:12:38] <rubyronin> and I can parse using postman
[14:12:38] <tasaif> could it be a browser issue?

[14:26:26] <tasaif> 1) you were appending to the container that you were removing from 2) bind to the container instead of the child
[14:26:45] <tasaif> printForever: what's it supposed to do?
[14:27:14] <printForever> just calculate few fields
[14:27:15] <printForever> add them up
[14:27:46] <fas3r> tasaif: thanks :) it seems that I add to change .on() to ").on('click', 'p', null,      what is the null if you know ? If not I will check the doc.
[14:28:19] <tasaif> it's also bound to a different element
[14:28:28] <tasaif> null is data you can pass into the callback

[14:54:32] <FL1SK> Hi
[14:54:48] <FL1SK> I am trying to use google sites for my jquery and its not behaving correctly
[14:55:01] <FL1SK> is there anyone here that can give me some pointers
[14:55:35] <ImACow2> I don't know if this exists, but is there like an "ajax templating engine" where I can say what content to put where ? or does that have to be done manually ?
[14:56:21] <ImACow2> Im using twig to generate a template, but the content comes from json data, so it would be handy if I can use some form of "pointer" on where to push the json data into
[15:02:40] <fas3r> is it possible to use wildcard ( * ) in the selector ? like all element starting with elem*    ?
[15:02:58] <tasaif> FL1SK: new void*
[15:03:09] <tasaif> what are you trying to do?
[15:03:09] <fas3r> found :)
[15:03:15] <fas3r> $("[id^=jander]")
[15:03:17] <fas3r> sorry
[15:03:22] <tasaif> np
[15:03:40] <tasaif> ImACow2: roll your own
[15:03:40] <FL1SK> Hi tasaif: I am trying to create a slideshow in HTML Box on google sites
[15:03:56] <ImACow2> tasaif ty sir
[15:05:11] <tasaif> FL1SK: why not use a slideshow library?
[15:05:59] <FL1SK> ok
[15:06:22] <FL1SK> do they have one in google sites tasaif.. do you know of how i would approach doing that with google sites
[15:06:32] <FL1SK> there seems to be a lot of restrictions in google sites
[15:11:03] <FL1SK> tasaif: I found this http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/simplest-jquery-slideshow
[15:11:14] <FL1SK> not sure it works in google sites
[15:11:36] <tasaif> one second
[15:14:06] <tasaif> FL1SK: your first step is figuring out how to include a javascript library to google sites
[15:14:28] <FL1SK> tasaif: thats easy
[15:14:38] <FL1SK> supposedly you just call it from this script line
[15:14:57] <FL1SK> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js">
[15:15:03] <tasaif> I tried that
[15:15:06] <FL1SK> me too
[15:15:09] <FL1SK> still does not work
[15:18:38] <tasaif> FL1SK: it looks like it's very involved
[15:18:44] <tasaif> you need to make something called a module
[15:18:48] <tasaif> for google sites
[15:18:57] <FL1SK> really
[15:19:00] <FL1SK> where are you reading this
[15:19:23] <tasaif> apparently there was a solution using something called the safe html bypass gadget

[15:45:01] <Tomashe> hey guys i was prepering a question regarding , fast and resouces taken with jquery, http://jsfiddle.net/8qLfs20y/1/ can i get an advise?
[15:47:07] <tasaif> Tomashe: it's better to search the dom I think
[15:47:13] <tasaif> but you do not search for children that way
[15:47:22] <tasaif> you want $('.con .page1')
[15:47:37] <Tomashe> realy
[15:47:57] <Tomashe> i was sure element.children(".page1").children(... is the most efficient way
[15:48:09] <Tomashe> less resouces in searching
[15:49:13] <tasaif> i could be wrong
[15:50:50] <tasaif> oh I see
[15:51:58] <tasaif> Tomashe: $('.con > .page1') I think is the equivalent
[15:52:43] <printForever> tasif, I had one small thing
[15:52:49] <Tomashe> but that does not answet the question
[15:52:51] <tasaif> tasaif*
[15:53:00] <printForever> tasaif, sorry :)
[15:53:03] <tasaif> no worries
[15:53:17] <tasaif> Tomashe: I think for performance global variables are faster
[15:53:26] <printForever> I'm changing one of the input fields with jQuery range plugin
[15:53:38] <printForever> and that field is then used in Calx
[15:53:45] <tasaif> But generally jquery is fast enough for most purposes
[15:53:47] <printForever> however, Calx is only updated "on blur"
[15:54:06] <tasaif> you can fire the blur manually
[15:54:09] <printForever> and the problem is, its not picking up on the range slider
[15:54:14] <printForever> ok, how?
[15:54:29] <tasaif> the range slider probably has an event that it's firing like onStop or something
[15:54:45] <tasaif> in there you can $(the field).trigger('blur') or something like that
[15:54:50] <printForever> right
[15:54:51] <printForever> ok
[15:55:06] <printForever> http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/
[15:55:29] <printForever> slider:changed
[15:55:42] <tasaif> that's the one
[15:56:12] <printForever> $("#my-input").bind("slider:ready", function (event, data) { ... })
[15:56:27] <printForever> whats with the function (event, data) I dont need that
[15:56:42] <tasaif> you're instantiating an anonymous function
[15:56:53] <robertBusy> you don't have to pass them if you don't need to use them
[15:57:00] <printForever> just $('input[type="range"]').bind('slider:changed');
[15:57:14] <printForever> am I right?
[15:57:27] <tasaif> the function(){} is you telling it what to do when that event is fired
[15:58:03] <printForever> run Calx?
[15:58:09] <printForever> because...
[15:58:10] <printForever> hm...
[15:58:35] <tasaif> $("input[type='range']").on('slider:changed', function(){$(this).trigger('blur')});
[15:59:23] <rhizome> are plugin questions OK? i'm having trouble getting ajaxText to appear in jqModal. As in, it isn't appearing.
[15:59:24] <printForever> ok, I will first try $('#rangeslider').bind('slider:changed');
[15:59:32] <robertmaxrees> you have to pass the function.
[15:59:47] <robertmaxrees> doing just $('#rangeslider').bind('slider:changed'); will result in nothing happening.
[15:59:53] <printForever> nope, tasaif is right
[16:01:05] <printForever> and still nothing
[16:01:14] <tasaif> (shrug)
[16:01:21] <printForever> yeah...
[16:01:25] <jim_j> hi
[16:01:28] <printForever> I'm having gremlins tonight
[16:01:52] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[16:02:10] <jim_j> what's the difference between:  &amp; and &#38; on a web page if it's in a link/url and are they interpreted as a '&' by all clients?
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> $('#rangeslider').bind('slider:changed', function() {$('input[type="range"]').trigger('blur'); });
[16:02:58] <robertmaxrees> they reference the exact same code point.
[16:03:06] <robertmaxrees> iirc &amp; is a sort of "shortcut", jim_j
[16:03:25] <jim_j> a shortcut?
[16:03:38] <printForever> I'll try robertmaxrees
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> or more link an easier to remember version.
[16:03:53] <robertmaxrees> *link=like
[16:04:11] <robertmaxrees> printForever you wouldn't happen to have a fiddle set up would you?
[16:04:13] <jim_j> and is it as iso compliant for all browsers?

[16:04:55] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I'm gonna... if this fails
[16:05:11] <robertmaxrees> jim_j they're both character refs that point to the same thing.
[16:12:34] <jim_j> thanks robertmaxrees, I'm trying to make sure they are browser compliant for all browsers.  is there a reference guide for them?
[16:13:01] <robertmaxrees> the link i shared points you to  1.1.1)
[16:13:01] <robertmaxrees> [2015:04:14:16:13:03] <jim_j> thanks robertmaxrees, I'm trying to make sure they are brow
[16:13:02] <robertmaxrees> woops
[16:13:06] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.3
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> this.
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> you can go from there.
[16:13:28] <jim_j> thanks!
[16:13:38] <decx> that select paste is still going strong eh
[16:13:46] <robertmaxrees> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html - there should be a similar list for html5, too.
[16:13:53] <robertmaxrees> decx yes - it's super frustrating.
[16:14:13] <decx> my new client doesnt do it and i still wonder why it didnt copy after selecting
[16:14:56] <Es0teric> how do i check if an element exists
[16:14:59] <Es0teric> to get its ID
[16:15:11] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric huh?
[16:15:16] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i want to get an elements ID
[16:15:23] <Es0teric> but i want to check if it exists first before assigning it
[16:15:56] <robertmaxrees> what do you have right now to select it?
[16:16:09] <robertmaxrees> because normally you'd do $('#someId').length
[16:16:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well i am using chartjs
[16:16:33] <Es0teric> so it uses document.getElementById
[16:16:47] <decx> .length will do it there too
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:17:36] <printForever> $('#rangeslider').bind('slider:changed', function(){ $('#rangeslider-slider').trigger('blur'); });   --- failed
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> probably because  $('#rangeslider-slider').trigger('blur'); } isn't the element that you want to trigger on.
[16:18:07] <printForever> oh crap
[16:18:25] <printForever> and still the same thing
[16:18:49] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[16:18:56] <printForever> sec
[16:23:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees the thing is that i get stuff like this job_chart = document.getElementById("job_chart").getContext("2d");
[16:23:43] <Es0teric> all over the place
[16:23:46] <Es0teric> which is null
[16:23:55] <Es0teric> i dont want it to assign the variable if its null
[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> then use conditionals or ternaries.
[16:24:20] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees obviously
[16:24:32] <Es0teric> but am i checking document.getElementById length?
[16:25:41] <tasaif> aren't you checking if the value is null?
[16:26:04] <tasaif> why check the length if you have the value already?
[16:26:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/87m4yobt/
[16:26:11] <tasaif> tmp = document.getElementById("job_chart").getContext("2d")
[16:26:13] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/r1mtq2vh/
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you check to see if it's == null
[16:26:45] <_BigWings_> https://jsfiddle.net/7uh5L7y7/
[16:27:07] <_BigWings_> how can I inspect and see the event handler on the obj object?
[16:27:25] <_BigWings_> specifically before obj has been added to the DOM
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[16:27:56] <_BigWings_> hmmm.. that sucks
[16:27:59] <tasaif> printForever: you have a ton of errors in your console
[16:27:59] <printForever> tasaif, robertmaxrees as you can see... there it is
[16:28:10] <printForever> lol I see none
[16:28:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any, either.
[16:28:28] <_BigWings_> im losing my event handler somewhere.. and its a bit hard debugging if I cant inspect the object and see what event handlers it has
[16:28:31] <printForever> just 2, missing PNG files
[16:28:51] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ i wonder if the append is cloning the element nstead.
[16:29:11] <tasaif> printForever: http://imgur.com/mIPmev1
[16:29:32] <robertmaxrees> oh, printForever you should use rawgit for github hosted filed.
[16:29:35] <robertmaxrees> *files
[16:29:45] <printForever> Firefox FTW
[16:29:46] <robertmaxrees> firefox will work fine, chrome won't
[16:30:04] <_BigWings_> so where are object event handlers stored then if you can't access them with a dev console
[16:30:05] <robertmaxrees> still something to keep in mind when trying to get help.
[16:30:08] <printForever> robertmaxrees, it was handy, for now
[16:30:31] <robertmaxrees> _BigWings_ internally to jquery. you should use a delegated listener for that kind of stuff anyway
[16:30:35] <printForever> and these two dont have CDN's
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's what rawgit does for yolu.
[16:30:49] <robertmaxrees> *you
[16:30:56] <printForever> yeah...
[16:31:04] <tasaif> unless you're on chrome?
[16:31:11] <tasaif> isn't there a way to change the mime type?
[16:31:18] <robertmaxrees> not from github, no.
[16:31:38] <printForever> I dont know where else to pull these files
[16:31:48] <robertmaxrees> rawgit
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> 4:16:31:33] <tasaif> unless you're on chrome?
[16:31:55] <robertmaxrees> [2015:04:14:16:31:40] <tasaif> isn't there a way to change the mime type?
[16:31:55] <robertmaxrees> [2015:04:14
[16:31:55] <tasaif> orionhub.org I found an hour ago
[16:32:00] <robertmaxrees> woops - https://rawgit.com
[16:32:04] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees i have this if( document.getElementById("pv_chart") !== null ) pv_chart = document.getElementById("pv_chart").getContext("2d"); and then i get this: ReferenceError: pv_chart is not defined
[16:32:13] <printForever> awesome!
[16:32:23] <tasaif> oh… well that's a thing
[16:32:30] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees that referenceerror is happening when i do if( pv_chart )
[16:32:39] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric make a fiddle.
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm playing guessing games.
[16:33:01] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/r1mtq2vh/1/
[16:33:31] <printForever> tasaif, is it working now?
[16:33:36] <tasaif> seems to be
[16:33:53] <printForever> anyway... that slider:changed
[16:34:02] <printForever> does not blur for Calx
[16:34:08] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees guessing games with what?
[16:34:12] <robertmaxrees> right, because $('#rangeslider').trigger('blur'); isn't what you want, printForever
[16:34:29] <printForever> then what am I bluring then? :( robertmaxrees
[16:34:40] <printForever> #rangeslider is the input field....
[16:34:44] <Es0teric> see this is why i dont like js.. when it comes to logical stuff you need a fiddle like 80% of hte time
[16:34:45] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric pv_chart = document.getElementById("pv_chart").getContext("2d"); could be undefined because .getContext('2d') isn't returning what you want.
[16:34:54] <Es0teric> not just you but everyone in general
[16:35:24] <printForever> Es0teric, you have to be accomodating to people here trying to help you, no way around it
[16:35:33] <Es0teric> right but logically i am checking if the element by ID exists regardless
[16:35:38] <Es0teric> so why would that if even pass
[16:35:40] <Es0teric> when the id doesnt exist?
[16:35:50] <Es0teric> the ID naturally would == null
[16:35:59] <Es0teric> therefore it should skip
[16:36:00] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric ... the ID does exist, but the getContext() call could still fail.
[16:36:19] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting what the issue it.
[16:36:59] <robertmaxrees> *is
[16:37:00] <printForever> robertmaxrees, can you point me to the right direction?
[16:37:10] <printForever> I'm not seeing whats wrong withthe trigger
[16:37:32] <robertmaxrees> printForever i'm lost - #rangeslider doesn't look like it holds the value after you init.
[16:37:49] <printForever> :/
[16:37:51] <robertmaxrees> something here isn't adding up.
[16:38:20] <printForever> however the example shown here
[16:38:20] <printForever> http://loopj.com/jquery-simple-slider/
[16:38:24] <tasaif> it uses the 'change' event
[16:38:25] <printForever> "Getting Slider Values"
[16:38:29] <printForever> works correctly
[16:38:36] <robertmaxrees> printForever right, that's not the issue though.
[16:38:43] <robertmaxrees> calx is looking for the input to be updated.
[16:38:47] <tasaif> you can also call .calx('update') as well apparently
[16:38:58] <printForever> hm...
[16:38:59] <robertmaxrees> but will that properly read the input?
[16:39:02] <printForever> inside the function?
[16:39:18] <printForever> input value is changed correctly, as i see it
[16:39:35] <robertmaxrees> which input?
[16:40:04] <printForever> one with #rangeslider ID
[16:40:17] <printForever> if you inspect it, in Firebug, and check DOM value
[16:40:20] <printForever> its set correctly
[16:40:37] <robertmaxrees> hrmm.
[16:41:01] <printForever> tasaif, can I call it after the value changed?
[16:41:35] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like that works.
[16:42:11] <tasaif> http://www.xsanisty.com/project/calx/configure/
[16:43:13] <printForever> tasaif, I've read that
[16:43:16] <printForever> there is nothing there
[16:43:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that the slider code is doing something with that form input that it shouldn't.
[16:43:36] <printForever> also, its old Clax
[16:43:39] <printForever> this is new http://www.xsanisty.com/project/calx2/configuration/
[16:43:41] <tasaif> I think what I would do in this scenario is make a hidden input
[16:43:47] <tasaif> and tie the slider value to the hidden one
[16:43:57] <robertmaxrees> tasaif there already is a hidden input.
[16:44:11] <printForever> check the link I posted
[16:44:37] <printForever> the Slider is hiding default input field and replacing it with new slider
[16:44:50] <printForever> once slider moves, it updates the value of the hidden input field
[16:44:58] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if the default input field is getting more than just "hidden" though.
[16:44:59] <printForever> problem is, that Clax is not reacting to the change in value
[16:46:09] <tasaif> I think I found the issue
[16:46:20] <printForever> oh, really?
[16:46:22] <tasaif> the hidden field and the replacement div both have the same id
[16:46:26] <tasaif> ids should be unique
[16:46:35] <printForever> o.0
[16:46:39] <printForever> but they are different
[16:46:40] <tasaif> i'm  a liar
[16:46:48] <tasaif> it's what I do
[16:46:55] <tasaif> I get at the podium and I lie
[16:47:35] <printForever> this is the ID of the slider #rangeslider-slider
[16:47:46] <printForever> this is the ID of the hidden input field #rangeslider
[16:47:46] <robertmaxrees> printForever they already admitted their mistake ;)
[16:47:53] <printForever> how they are the same?
[16:48:46] <igyiguygyu> Anyone has worked with ScrollMagic?
[16:49:01] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ igyiguygyu
[16:49:01] <b-ot> igyiguygyu: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:49:20] <igyiguygyu> It creates a pinspacer that just pushes all my content down :/
[16:50:07] <printForever> uhg... I have no idea how to break this down
[16:50:08] <robertmaxrees> printForever i'm pretty convinced that the simple slider plugin is doing something it shouldn't to that input.
[16:51:01] <tasaif> i second the motion
[16:51:10] <tasaif> use a different slider plugin
[16:51:27] <printForever> its working correctly
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:51:37] <printForever> can you just help me to get this input field to blur
[16:51:49] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's not your problem.
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> you've gotten it to blur which does nothing.
[16:52:12] <printForever> problem is that Clax is only firing on BLUR
[16:52:18] <robertmaxrees> *sigh
[16:52:20] <printForever> it does not blur
[16:52:59] <tasaif> I'm going to try a couple more things before I give in
[16:53:17] <robertmaxrees> printForever http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r1mtq2vh/4/
[16:53:54] <printForever> robertmaxrees, nothing is happening
[16:53:58] <misutowolf> Got a question, folks.  I'm working on a little JS thing for a class and trying to use $.get() to fetch data from a remote API.  I'm getting an error talking about CORS (Cross-Origin), and I don't really know how to fix it.  Relevant Code here:  http://pastebin.com/5Nma8v9b
[16:54:00] <robertmaxrees> open your console, printForever
[16:54:15] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf you can't fix CORS from your sie.
[16:54:26] <robertmaxrees> the remote API has to allow it.
[16:54:43] <misutowolf> I see.
[16:55:03] <printForever> robertmaxrees, these are two different things
[16:55:11] <printForever> you crated .on blur
[16:55:14] * misutowolf hmms
[16:55:27] <robertmaxrees> printForever ...
[16:55:32] <robertmaxrees> right, i bound to the blur event.
[16:55:35] <printForever> but the problem is that .bind slider:changed is not triggering blur
[16:55:37] <robertmaxrees> and then triggered it.
[16:55:42] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:55:43] <robertmaxrees> it IS.
[16:55:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm proving it in thta fiddle.
[16:55:56] <printForever> .on and .bind are not the same
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> they are, actually.
[16:56:16] * misutowolf is sort of confused, as he can call stuff from his REST client in Firefox, but it's not having it from this code.
[16:56:30] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf you can't call it from within a page.
[16:56:35] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it server-side
[16:56:49] <robertmaxrees> printForever and that part is irrelevant.
[16:56:51] <misutowolf> That's pretty annoying.
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf it's also safe.
[16:57:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'd be able to scrape your email as you.
[16:57:10] <misutowolf> That makes sense, I guess.
[16:57:16] <robertmaxrees> printForever the blur event is firing on that element.
[16:57:23] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with how it's bound.
[16:57:37] <misutowolf> It's just frustrating, that's all.  This also means that the thing I was going to do for my JS homework is probably impossible.
[16:57:54] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf not impossible, you just need a server to proxy through.
[16:58:18] <tasaif> you know what I find strange… you can't update the value using the methods mentioned
[16:58:23] <tasaif> .calx('calculate')
[16:58:27] <tasaif> or .calx('update')
[16:58:29] <tasaif> or whatever
[16:58:40] <printForever> ok
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase the input for the slider is no longer recognized by calx.
[16:58:44] <robertmaxrees> for whatever reason.
[16:58:56] <tasaif> no, I made a new slider
[16:58:57] <tasaif> sorry
[16:58:59] <tasaif> new input*
[16:59:23] <tasaif> and I set the value with .val(blegh) then .calx('calculate')
[16:59:54] <tasaif> maybe calx doesn't respect .val
[17:00:11] <tasaif> maybe something very stupid is happening
[17:00:15] <robertmaxrees> what element are you running .calx() against?
[17:00:33] <printForever> here are some samples for Calx
[17:00:34] <printForever> http://prototype.xsanisty.com/calx2/
[17:00:41] <robertmaxrees> already there, printForever
[17:00:45] <printForever> sorry
[17:01:12] <tasaif> got it
[17:01:33] * misutowolf thinks some.
[17:01:33] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:01:39] <printForever> please, do tell
[17:01:40] <tasaif> $('#sheet').calx('setValue', 'A1', '100');
[17:01:53] <tasaif> it has some sort of internal table that it keeps track of
[17:02:38] <printForever> ok and?
[17:03:15] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/5y18oj91/2/
[17:03:20] <tasaif> there's half your solution
[17:03:27] <robertmaxrees> http://www.xsanisty.com/project/calx2/cell-api/ ah
[17:03:36] <robertmaxrees> printForever small question - why are you using calx?
[17:03:37] <tasaif> except instead of a1
[17:03:39] <tasaif> you set it to something
[17:03:49] <printForever> I wanted to do a simple caluclation
[17:03:52] <printForever> with the slider
[17:04:00] <robertmaxrees> why bring in an entire library to do that?
[17:04:01] <printForever> 1 + 10 + 20 * %
[17:04:08] <tasaif> lol
[17:04:12] <printForever> well... I dont know any better :(
[17:04:16] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: duh
[17:04:22] <tasaif> it's so we can chase the gooses
[17:04:40] <robertmaxrees> calx looks like it has some strange excel-like internal representation of data.
[17:04:47] <printForever> it does
[17:04:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just just hardcode the calculations you want and call it a day?
[17:05:01] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/5y18oj91/4/
[17:05:02] <tasaif> done
[17:05:07] <printForever> I thought this was easier :(
[17:05:11] <printForever> I'm really sorry
[17:05:14] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[17:05:18] <printForever> I thought it was past and done
[17:05:19] <printForever> but...
[17:05:25] <printForever> I lost 7 hours on this
[17:05:26] <robertmaxrees> plugins aren't always the answer.
[17:05:36] <robertmaxrees> hand-rolling things is legitimate.
[17:05:55] <printForever> tasaif, thank you man!
[17:05:56] <misutowolf> Well, shit.  I forget the login information for my account on my school webserver.
[17:06:01] * misutowolf bleghs.
[17:06:10] <tasaif> np
[17:06:38] <tasaif> you could make it more robust by reading .data('cell') instead of hardcoding A4
[17:06:55] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf you could try to hit that API using jsonp, but that might not work either.
[17:06:58] <tasaif> then you can do multiple sliders a lot easier
[17:07:06] <printForever> if I'm ever to do this again I will hardcode the hell out of it
[17:07:07] <tasaif> (should you want to)
[17:07:08] <misutowolf> Yeah, that's what I'm going to try to do.
[17:07:32] <printForever> .data('cell')?
[17:09:13] <tasaif> hold on
[17:10:03] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/5y18oj91/7/
[17:10:19] <printForever> aaa
[17:10:20] <printForever> right
[17:10:24] <printForever> I understand
[17:10:48] <printForever> btw. funny thing is
[17:10:56] <printForever> I'm left with the calculate button
[17:11:05] <printForever> that doesen't do $hit now :D
[17:11:13] <tasaif> so remove the button
[17:11:26] <printForever> have to check with the guys in managment
[17:11:31] <printForever> :(
[17:11:48] <misutowolf> I mean, this is the correct way to attempt JSONP, right?   http://pastebin.com/BqPmBJGB
[17:11:49] <printForever> they love Call-To-Action buttons
[17:12:10] <robertmaxrees> "calculate" isn't a cta.
[17:12:30] <printForever> robertmaxrees, in all honesty... no, but they call it like that
[17:12:35] <robertmaxrees> yep, misutowolf
[17:12:58] <robertmaxrees> misutowolf also, use anything other than pastebin.
[17:13:04] <misutowolf> Haha, sorry.
[17:13:16] <misutowolf> It's just what I've become used to.  I apologze.
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[17:13:39] * misutowolf ponders.
[17:13:52] <tasaif> bengals suck
[17:13:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, if jsonp fails, you're basically SOL.
[17:16:25] <misutowolf> http://jsfiddle.net/ptktqub7/ <-- Current state of what I'm working on.
[17:16:56] <robertmaxrees> var cardArray =  new Array(); :(
[17:16:58] <robertmaxrees> just use []
[17:17:33] * misutowolf nods, doesn't know why he did it that way, really.
[17:17:36] <robertmaxrees> also, you're running into variable scoping problems.
[17:20:09] <misutowolf> :(
[17:21:14] <tasaif> misutowolf: excessive comments can be negated by naming your variables appropriately
[17:21:30] <robertmaxrees> or by being more experienced ;_)
[17:21:38] <ehlovader> robertmaxrees I updated my post with examples of what I was seeing from the bootstrap buttons and pagination... https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/27241/how-do-i-get-first-and-last-buttons-styled-with-bootstrap
[17:21:47] <misutowolf> I suppose, I just did it so if people in my class looked at my code they might know what was going on.
[17:21:51] <ehlovader> if it is helpful or maybe stands out but thanks for your help earlier
[17:21:55] <misutowolf> Either way, it's not working the way it sohuld, or....something.
[17:22:05] <robertmaxrees> MissionCritical strive for code that doesn't require comments to explain itself.
[17:22:29] <robertmaxrees> err, misutowolf
[17:22:33] <tasaif> why not call the cardArray a deck?
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ptktqub7/1/
[17:22:52] <misutowolf> I'll do that.
[17:23:20] <robertmaxrees> also, i'd avoid using a for loop, and i'd especially avoid using it when running ajax.
[17:29:55] <tasaif> misutowolf: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/7xu3oo4r/2/
[17:30:35] <robertmaxrees> cardarray is undefined now, and you're missing a semicolon ;)
[17:31:18] <tasaif> pssh
[17:31:20] <misutowolf> Ah.  I'm pretty new to a lot of this stuff.
[17:31:23] <tasaif> ain't nobody got time for semicolons
[17:31:40] <robertmaxrees> also you should generally avoid using capitals for objects unless they're constructors.
[17:33:36] <tasaif> also, I didn't update the other cardArray down there
[17:36:04] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/7xu3oo4r/3/
[17:36:08] <misutowolf> I almost just want to kind of rewrite this.  Though given this CORS issue, I feel like I can't even test it properly without having to apparently proxy it through something, which I don't actually know how to do.
[17:37:51] <robertmaxrees> there's a gotcha in that code, tasaif
[17:38:20] <tasaif> qwe?
[17:38:36] <tasaif> misutowolf: you could disable cors for your browser if you really wanted to
[17:38:38] <robertmaxrees> for loops don't create scope, so all those var statements in there are actually hoisted.
[17:39:06] <misutowolf> >.<
[17:39:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7xu3oo4r/4/ this is closer.
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> though the ajax calls still present a problem.
[17:40:46] <tasaif> yea… the api is designed for curling
[17:40:56] * misutowolf nods
[17:41:02] <robertmaxrees> "curling"?
[17:41:07] <tasaif> curl-ing
[17:41:09] <tasaif> wget-ing
[17:41:16] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.  server-side.
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> no client-side
[17:41:36] <misutowolf> :(
[17:41:37] <tasaif> just contact the owner and politely ask them to turn allow CORS
[17:41:49] <tasaif> s/turn//
[17:42:01] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason for them not to except to keep bandwidth costs down.
[17:42:55] <misutowolf> Okay, I'll give it a shot at least.
[17:43:13] <tasaif> if that doesn't work, just find his family and then...
[17:43:24] <misutowolf> :D
[17:43:25] <tasaif> take them out to dinner
[17:43:35] <misutowolf> And then make them an offer they can't refuse?
[17:43:45] <tasaif> exactly
[17:43:51] <misutowolf> :D :D
[17:44:04] <tasaif> what I would do is set up a server maybe on heroku or something
[17:44:14] <tasaif> and make my own end point that piggybacks off theirs
[17:44:18] <robertmaxrees> a free instance, yeah.
[17:45:19] <misutowolf> That sounds doable.  I don't actually know how to do that sorta stuff (I've used Heroku before), but not dealing with APIs/endpoints.
[17:46:08] <tasaif> this might also be a thing to look into https://jsonp.afeld.me/
[17:47:00] <misutowolf> Ooh, that might be quite useful.
[17:47:12] <robertmaxrees> that'd be simple on heroku.
[17:47:18] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/afeld/jsonp very simple API.
[17:47:38] <tasaif> that's pretty great
[17:48:05] <misutowolf> That's pretty amazing.
[17:49:57] <misutowolf> I just need to remember the login information for my webserver.
[17:50:12] <robertmaxrees> can you install node on it?
[17:50:40] <misutowolf> Yeah, I have root access.
[17:50:41] <misutowolf> It's a VPS>
[17:50:46] <robertmaxrees> rad
[17:50:50] <misutowolf> I was using it mostly for Meteor development.
[17:51:00] <misutowolf> Well, fiddling with Meteor and running game servers for a couple friends.
[17:56:17] <tasaif> misutowolf:
[17:56:17] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/7xu3oo4r/11/
[17:57:05] <tasaif> results may vary
[17:57:17] <misutowolf> Kickass.
[18:07:27] <misutowolf> I wish I had my desktop here in my apartment.
[18:07:40] <misutowolf> The keyboard is comfortable for sure, but it's hard to want to develop on a 16" laptop.
[18:07:59] <misutowolf> WHen my desktop has two 1080p monitors :(
[18:08:16] <ehlovader> misutowolf feel you.
[18:08:26] <misutowolf> It's rough for sure.
[18:08:55] <ehlovader> right now I am in a struggle between dev at home where I am least distracted but have just laptop screen
[18:09:06] <misutowolf> Yeah, like
[18:09:12] <ehlovader> or work where I am most distracted. And my desk isn't quit the most productive setup too
[18:09:17] <ehlovader> working on that
[18:09:32] <misutowolf> At least I'm not really distracted right here, but holy crap...it's not exactly the best environment ever to work with.
[18:09:43] <misutowolf> The only upside is that I'm in Linux and don't have a bunch of games to distract me.
[18:09:44] <ehlovader> I use livereload and gulp, I was trying out using chromecast on my tv as a second monitor
[18:10:01] <ehlovader> I could cast a tab, which sites in the background, but usually I still needed to interact with the page some to really test what I was working on
[18:10:08] <ehlovader> it wasn't super effective
[18:12:24] <misutowolf> I am apparently also a terrible college student, because it seems my apartment contains no writing utensils
[18:12:26] <misutowolf> :/
[18:12:36] <ehlovader> along the same thought of the chromecasting though, I would like to develop a device lab like wall similar to this. https://twitter.com/lukew/status/482223951876067328
[18:12:36] <b-ot> ehlovader: @lukew: Now that's a device lab! http://t.co/f549wTEsyY
[18:12:49] <ehlovader> lol
[18:12:50] <ehlovader> not one?
[18:14:57] <misutowolf> Whoa.
[18:24:31] <gemclip> can i use jquery for form handling? I would like to have a user upload a file to the server and change the filename based on a text box. Is this possible using jquery or should I be looking at php?
[18:35:32] <monk12> hey all, just curious in my old dropbox app there used to be a 'Copy Public Link' when you right clicked on a file, which got u a link i believe you could put on jsfiddle. I think now there is a 'Share link' which gives users direct link to view the file (in text/html) but not the actual raw file.
[18:35:53] <monk12> trying to setup a JSFiddle now and need to get this JS file on a public server. Dropbox i think is what i used be4.
[18:37:23] <ehlovader> monk12 is that file in your public folder?
[18:37:40] <ehlovader> I think that matters whether dropbox says you can share it with a viewer or get a direct link
[18:37:50] <ehlovader> even if shared you should be able to get a link though
[18:40:01] <misutowolf> yea
[18:40:10] <ehlovader> ah, they did move it around a bit... try using the context menu on the image in the viewer ... https://i.imgur.com/BAiyFgm.png
[18:40:17] <ehlovader> there is a view original link
[18:40:30] <ehlovader> should take you to https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Public/
[18:40:43] <ehlovader> with a bunch of other stuff that is important like your uid
[18:45:03] <monk12> ehlovader:  in the Viewer, u mean on the online website?
[18:45:52] <ehlovader> oh, perhaps
[18:45:58] <ehlovader> hmm, that won't work will it, you are in the app
[18:46:27] <ehlovader> technically you can follow the link without being logged in I think
[18:46:29] <monk12> in Windows 7, i am in teh folder.... or online in the website. either way, i dont see that View Orig link
[18:46:46] <ehlovader> try just cliking, not right clicking on the website
[18:47:00] <ehlovader> maybe it isn't viewable for public.. that would be a shame
[18:47:58] <monk12> i dont get those options. it goes straight to the file when i click on it in the website, and has Share and Download buttons on the right. no raw orig. how did you get that popup?
[18:48:12] <monk12> i cant find it via the app(right clicking folder) or the website
[18:48:24] <monk12> and I am in the public folder that ive used be4
[18:49:36] <ehlovader> click on the image itself
[18:49:39] <ehlovader> in the middle
[18:49:41] <ehlovader> or right click
[18:50:05] <monk12> by image do you mean, the image of the .js file on the website?
[18:50:21] <ehlovader> yeah it is right click
[18:50:27] <ehlovader> uh er
[18:50:31] <ehlovader> what does it do in the viewer?
[18:50:48] <ehlovader> I was looking at non text content
[18:51:17] <ehlovader> or try changing that ?dl=0 to dl=1
[18:51:23] <ehlovader> well ?dl=1
[18:51:29] <monk12> hehe. tried all thta dl=1 means download
[18:51:38] <ehlovader> so
[18:51:38] <monk12> i dont want jsfiddle to dl the file, right?
[18:51:43] <ehlovader> that is what you want
[18:51:51] <ehlovader> it is the content you want basically
[18:51:53] <monk12> as long as I can view the GET request in my browser as a raw file.
[18:52:00] <monk12> then jsfiddle should be able to see it.
[18:52:09] <ehlovader> that is what the dl does, just has a couple extra headers to trick the browser to not render it
[18:52:10] <monk12> but I cant see it that way no matter what I try
[18:52:14] <ehlovader> but you don't need a browser to render it
[18:52:27] <monk12> K, ill try that the dl=1 in jsfiddle to see if dls it.
[18:53:47] <monk12> eh looks like maybe failed to get the file (http://jsfiddle.net/armyofda12mnkeys/Leym2zaz/1/)  the angular injector error is separate.
[18:54:11] <monk12> the file itself doesnt show up in my Network panel. so think may have not worked :( (unless Network panel is lying)
[18:55:38] <monk12> or maybe it did, Firebug and Chrome dev tools say 302 OK instead of the usual 200 OK, but dont display the content (so not sure if really got it).
[18:55:55] <ehlovader> they may block it
[18:56:09] <ehlovader> why not just use gist and rawgit
[18:56:30] <ehlovader> https://rawgit.com/
[18:57:53] <monk12> K ill look into that. sometimes I jsut want to get up a file quick and Dropbox and/or FTP seemed like quickest options.
[18:57:59] <monk12> thanks ehlovader.
[18:58:28] <ehlovader> np, just seems like you could spend more time trying to figure that out than it would be worth
[18:59:00] <ehlovader> sounds like it isn't for a permanent site/solution, gist is often my go to for those situations
[18:59:21] <ehlovader> rawgit is required though since github stopped sending correct mime types with the raw content
[19:00:05] <monk12> its just sometimes I may want to drag a whole jquery plugin folder and then just pick the plugin and its 'child plugin' files i want via a fiddle. and not sure if gist would be appropriate for quick and dirty job like that.
[19:10:33] <ehlovader> ah, gotcha... I was just thinking earlier it would be neat to have a jsfiddle but one that accepted a bower.json file for dependencies.
[19:12:00] <Kamuela> can chrome's console be used to trigger clicks on certain site elements? just got a twitter tool and i'm going through large lists and clicking the same button over and over
[19:37:52] <monk12> Kamuela, i beleive ive used Firebug for something liek that. so Chrome should do the same.
[19:38:16] <monk12> I used or injected jquery into the browser and just found a selector i wanted, and triggered a click on it.
[19:46:44] <Kamuela> monk12, i got this css path: #spammers > ul > li:nth-child(1) > small > a.block, but i'm kinda noob to figure out what to trigger clicks on. even somethig that just had a setInterval would work
[19:50:53] <igyiguygyu> Anyone knows how to set a scene in scroll magic with no end point? The whole sequence should be triggered as you reach trigger and thats it?
[19:54:26] <igyiguygyu> nvm, stupid me, just had to remove duration ._  .
[19:55:33] <monk12> Kamuela: i think its $('.selectorUwant').trigger('click')
[19:55:46] <monk12> just run that in Firebug or Chrome console
[19:56:26] <Kamuela> I'm trying to find the right selector for anchor tags where href is #block
[19:56:42] <Kamuela> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8683116/jquery-selector-for-links-with-in-href-attribute
[19:56:43] <Kamuela> hm
[19:57:42] <Kamuela> monk12, <3 that worked :D
[19:57:47] <monk12> sweet.
[19:59:01] <Kamuela> hmm well it sort of worked, the quirk is that i think it does it so fast it clicks it again sometimes
[19:59:15] <Kamuela> and that seems to trigger a reversal, it ends up netting what I want but hmm
[20:01:57] <Kamuela> this works $("a[href*=#block]").first().trigger('click'); and now i'm gonna wrap it in a setinterval
[20:01:58] <Kamuela> :D
[20:05:04] <Kamuela> beautiful. setInterval(function () {$("a[href*=#block]").first().trigger('click');}, 500); works
[20:13:52] <TeddyMurray> hi, how do you display an .webm file after its been dynamically loaded with ajax?
[20:57:15] <igyiguygyu> Hey, i'm having trouble with Greensock Tween staggerFromTo. I can't seem to start the staggering of the li elements at the same time. http://codepen.io/kokozaurz/pen/GgVOyj
[20:57:41] <igyiguygyu> right now all the li elements for each container load at the same time
[20:58:42] <igyiguygyu> I need the delay on each li element and they should start at the same time
[20:59:05] <igyiguygyu> Where's my problem?
[21:00:41] <igyiguygyu> IF I use staggerFromTo("li"... it loads makes the whole list elements in array and loads them sequentially
[21:28:12] <Uhkis> off-topic for this channel
[21:51:02] <IceTrAiN> igyiguygyu: change the stagger to 0?
[21:51:11] <IceTrAiN> the last parameter
[21:52:49] <igyiguygyu> you mean by creating var = objects [".box1 > li, ".box2 > li"..
[21:52:51] <igyiguygyu> ?
[21:53:10] <IceTrAiN> TweenMax.staggerFromTo("li", 1 , {opacity:0} , {opacity:1} , 0)
[21:54:10] <IceTrAiN> the last parameter is the delay between each animation
[21:54:20] <IceTrAiN> if you want them all to start at the same time, set it to 0
[21:54:35] <igyiguygyu> Yeah, what happens is that the whole container loads up
[21:54:40] <igyiguygyu> instead of each li
[21:55:08] <igyiguygyu> it should be just like TweenMax.staggerFromTo("li", 1 , {opacity:0} , {opacity:1} , 1)
[21:56:11] <IceTrAiN> you want the 3 rows to load 1 after the other?
[21:56:22] <igyiguygyu> I want all the 3 rows start at the same time
[21:56:43] <igyiguygyu> I hope that makes sense
[21:56:52] <IceTrAiN> so basically one column at a time?
[21:57:27] <igyiguygyu> yeah
[21:59:47] <igyiguygyu> I was looking over their docs, couldn't see anything that would indicate on how to do that
[22:00:17] <IceTrAiN> like this? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwMOxm
[22:01:17] <IceTrAiN> you could probably do it in one call if you wanted to get cheeky with a multi-dimensional array but ain't nobody got time fo' dat.
[22:02:29] <igyiguygyu> Yeah! thanks, I was looking in a different direction as I was trying to figure out how to get it into single call
[22:03:18] <IceTrAiN> np
[22:10:31] <IceTrAiN> igyiguygyu: you could do it this way too if you really wanted to, http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwMOxm but personally i think the first way is cleaner, and easier to maintain if you add new items
[22:11:31] <igyiguygyu> This one is actually better because as I'm playing around with the animation, editing stuff in a single field is better! Thanks! :)
[22:11:38] <IceTrAiN> :)
[22:11:44] <igyiguygyu> or no actually
[22:11:59] <igyiguygyu> I have about 50 li elements under each ul
[22:12:20] <igyiguygyu> and they don't have individual classes so actually first one is better then
[22:13:03] <IceTrAiN> hmm
[22:18:15] <IceTrAiN> igyiguygyu: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PwMOxm
[22:18:23] <IceTrAiN> best of both
[22:22:01] <IceTrAiN> technically you don't need the index or array parameters in that function, so you can take them out of you want
[22:22:17] <igyiguygyu> yeah it worked but it broke the scroll magic I'm using for it to initiate
[22:26:24] <igyiguygyu> Not sure why
[22:29:22] <igyiguygyu> this is what follows after
[22:29:24] <igyiguygyu> http://codepen.io/kokozaurz/pen/pvMdBx
[22:41:34] <IceTrAiN> igyiguygyu: if you click the little red exclaimation mark it tells you what the error is
[22:42:10] <IceTrAiN> basically, you don't need line 20
[22:43:02] <igyiguygyu> Yea I know, but I need that because that closes off the scrollMagic
[22:43:04] <igyiguygyu> scene
[22:43:31] <igyiguygyu> If I remove that, it doesnt work either.. sorry, I'm a lama.
[22:43:39] <IceTrAiN> no, the scene is closed off on line 14
[22:44:26] <IceTrAiN> count how many opening brackets you have and then count how many closing ones you have.  easy way to tell if you're over/under on brackets :P
[22:45:26] <igyiguygyu> I mean the stuff after line 14
[22:46:51] <IceTrAiN> there's an opening/closing pair after 14, yes
[22:46:57] <IceTrAiN> 16 and 18.
[22:52:16] <igyiguygyu> Oh I found the problem, because higher up it's already in a function
[22:52:51] <IceTrAiN> :)
[22:52:53] <igyiguygyu> this is how it looks
[22:52:54] <igyiguygyu> https://jsfiddle.net/q1uw9fk9/
[22:53:45] <IceTrAiN> ah ok, yes, in that context it's needed
[22:55:44] <igyiguygyu> Sorry, yeah lesson learned I should always provide full context :/
[22:56:49] <igyiguygyu> What am I missing?
[23:07:58] <photoius> I have a div id... $('#s-discharge-yes')..... how do I then get the first instance of div class "item" within that?
