[00:01:31] <clouder`grr> what happen to thecodeplayer? down for maintenance or down for ever?
[00:21:10] <Sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/dqhUM/1/ Why does that toggle make the button immediately close and disapear?
[00:21:27] <okdamn> hi there , i would like to know if jquery mobile supports Android 2.3
[00:21:30] <okdamn> any idea if?
[00:24:19] <Mohsen_Hassani> Hello guys. What's the difference between $("#something").click(function()) and $("#something").on('click', function())?
[00:25:00] <sacho> Mohsen_Hassani, .click is a proxy for .on('click')
[00:25:31] <sacho> with more limited capability
[00:25:50] <Mohsen_Hassani> sacho, hmmm.... I don't understand 'proxy', does it mean no differences?
[00:27:24] <sacho> Mohsen_Hassani, .click simply calls .on.
[00:28:03] <Sadtaco> Why can i bind .click() but not toggle()?
[00:29:02] <okdamn> can i use both jquery mobile and jquery in same page?
[00:32:50] <sacho> Sadtaco, your question doesn't make sense.
[00:33:04] <Sadtaco> jquery ui must use .toggle()
[00:33:13] <Sadtaco> http://jsfiddle.net/dqhUM/1/ sacho
[00:33:35] <sacho> the toggle handler doesn't exist in 1.9
[00:33:43] <sacho> you'd know that if you read its documentation :)
[00:33:49] <Sadtaco> In jquery or ui?
[00:33:54] <sacho> in jquery.
[00:34:00] <Sadtaco> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ oh
[00:34:01] <Sadtaco> yeah
[00:34:03] <Sadtaco> it does say that
[00:34:09] <Sadtaco> I didn't even know where to look for that until now
[00:38:15] <okdamn> if i have a js file with all my jquery functions, will they run on jquery mobile?
[00:38:23] <okdamn> or i need to include jquery.min.js
[00:38:24] <okdamn> ?
[00:38:56] <okdamn> also do you know if jquery mobile supports Android 2.3.3 y scrolling on overflow-y:auto?
[00:39:09] <okdamn> i would like to make a top navbar and a bottom navbar
[02:11:34] <whatever_42> hey. i am using ajax to update my page. now i added <form> and submit buttons so once you finished the last input you can just use enter to fire your request. however firefox keep refreshing the page. i already added return false; and preventDefault.
[02:14:13] <Abbas|> guys, why does my submenu fades out when i hover over it, it should only fadebout on mouseout. Please see the 1st and 4th top-menu items > http://jsfiddle.net/DgNJK/1/
[02:15:54] <Abbas|> sorry this is the proper jquery code > http://jsfiddle.net/DgNJK/2/
[02:17:07] <AbbasX2> there's no code telling the submenu to fadebout when hovering OVER it
[02:17:14] <AbbasX2> can't figure it out
[02:31:12] <ryorky1> is there a way in firefox or chrome to determine what scripts are running say for a click event?
[02:36:50] <ravenzz> ryorky1 in Chrome you should inspect the element and expand the Event Listeners item from the right side accordion
[02:37:25] <ravenzz> here is a list of event listeners attached to the node
[02:38:09] <ravenzz> expand one of them and the click the script name link (it is on the right)
[02:38:48] <ravenzz> hopefully the script in question is not minified
[03:00:50] <rabbi1> how to select an element with is 'not' of that particular id ?
[03:01:24] <rabbi1> sorry not() ‚Ä¶. :)
[03:01:27] <rabbi1> got it
[03:02:07] <rabbi1> is this correct ? $('a:not[href="#local"]') ?
[03:08:59] <MiracleBlue> Hey all :)
[03:16:13] <MiracleBlue> Had a question about css3 transition performance if anyone can help.  I've got two elements animating on the x axis using translate3d (and tried translate normal earlier), independently of each other (but simultaneously), and I noticed it's really quite jittery.  Especially in firefox.
[03:21:38] <Lucaszz> Hi
[03:22:47] <MiracleBlue> heya
[03:32:12] <Lucaszz> Im using jquery 1.8 whih may be the cause of ".on" method dont working
[03:32:15] <Lucaszz> ?
[03:35:30] <basiclaser> hey guys are there any APIs that allow text in an html document to be edited as though it was in a textarea box, even though it visually just looks like a <p> ?
[03:38:47] <fikst> basiclaser, http://jsfiddle.net/4mLGy/
[03:40:35] <ctienrsg> How can I select a random element with a specific class/div?
[03:42:00] <basiclaser> fikst: beautiful, thanks!
[03:42:10] <Cork> ctienrsg:  var items = $('.class'); item.eq(Math.rand() * items.length);
[03:42:42] <ctienrsg> thank you Cork !
[03:42:52] <Cork> ctienrsg: opps sorry its Math.random()
[03:43:03] <ctienrsg> np :)
[03:43:06] <Cork> and you need floor too
[03:43:19] <Cork> Math.floor(Math.random() * item.length))
[03:43:51] <ctienrsg> This is useful to know. Looks easy. Thanks for your help
[03:43:59] <Cork> np
[03:44:30] <Cork> oh, and you might actually have to do .length -1 as length is 1 based while eq is 0 based
[03:44:39] <Cork> but not sure there
[03:45:08] <ctienrsg> you know, I can google if some little problems remain :)
[03:45:15] <Cork> :P
[03:58:45] <DaVinciIT> hi all. in http://try.jquery.com/ there is the sidebar button on the top left corner. where is the 'onclick' client script ? I would like see the javascript funciont that hide/show men√π. thank you.
[04:03:22] <ctienrsg> DaVinciIT: had a look with firebug
[04:03:32] <ctienrsg> the sidebar seems to be in an aside-element
[04:05:04] <DaVinciIT> ctienrsg:  thank you
[04:05:13] <ctienrsg> does that help you??
[04:06:14] <ctienrsg> I can give u all js commands on that side, but you'd have to figure out yourself which actually fits to the the sidebar you need
[04:09:06] <ctienrsg> DaVinciIT: I think I have found it
[04:09:21] <ctienrsg> they simply use add a class to achieve this effect
[04:11:09] <DaVinciIT> yes.. somethinkg like 'accordion'. thank you very much for your time.
[04:12:29] <DaVinciIT> when write an html page, I would include the "css links" and "javascript links" in a separate html file, and include it in the <HEAD> section is it possible? thank you.
[04:13:40] <ctienrsg> idk why you need jscript for this
[04:14:25] <ctienrsg> and idk what the problem is. If you use the <script>-tag you can give any source of the file you want
[04:15:16] <DaVinciIT> I think about future. If I change the scriptlink in a 1 page (thinking about new jquery version), I'll need to change in every html pages.
[04:16:30] <ctienrsg> A solution might be to define a header that is the same for every page
[04:16:43] <ctienrsg> So you just use the same header for every page
[04:18:32] <ctienrsg> Maybe what you want can be achieved with use of PHP. With php you can include a html code snippet anywhere you like with a simple php line
[04:19:00] <DaVinciIT>  ok perfect thank you.
[04:19:12] <Abbas5> guys, why does my submenu fades out when i hover over it, it should only fadebout on mouseout. Please see the 1st and 4th top-menu items > http://jsfiddle.net/DgNJK/2/
[04:24:14] <ctienrsg> DaVinciIT: if you will ever want to use such snippets google PHP include() and you will learn that in 30 seconds
[04:24:16] <veganista> Anyone know if its possible to have resizable contain the elements width and not its height?
[04:24:24] <queztone> Why is this simple toggleclass not working? :/
[04:24:25] <queztone> http://jsfiddle.net/jdzjX/
[04:24:28] <Cork> Abbas5: you prob want mouse leave not mouseout
[04:24:50] <Cork> Abbas5: mouseout triggers when you hover another element, it doesn't matter if it's a child or not
[04:25:55] <ctienrsg> queztone: i am confused
[04:26:09] <ctienrsg> ur hidden class can not work when it is not in your html
[04:26:51] <ctienrsg> you have to put it in your html, then your css can hide it and you can make it appear again with jquery
[04:27:06] <queztone> hmm
[04:27:09] <queztone> ahh
[04:27:14] <queztone> otherwise i'd have to use addclass
[04:27:15] <queztone> ?
[04:27:22] <veganista> queztone: you dont have jquery loaded in the fiddle
[04:27:23] <Cork> queztone: you need jquery loaded http://jsfiddle.net/jdzjX/1/
[04:27:51] <veganista> http://jsfiddle.net/jdzjX/2/
[04:27:55] <veganista> ha
[04:27:58] <Cork> :P
[04:28:07] <veganista> beat me to it!
[04:28:28] <queztone> heh
[04:28:33] <queztone> ok, so i can use toggleclass after all
[04:28:49] <queztone> hmm i thought i had jquery loaded in my html
[04:29:10] <queztone> i added: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
[04:29:26] <Cork> queztone: though toggle is quite pointless in that situation as you're hiding the target for the click
[04:29:30] <Cork> so you can never show it again
[04:29:38] <queztone> yeah
[04:29:42] <queztone> i also have another div tho
[04:29:45] <queztone> that shows when this hides
[04:29:46] <Cork> (so addCLass could work just as well)
[04:29:51] <queztone> (and visa versa)
[04:29:51] * Cork nods
[04:30:09] <Abbas|> 16:24 Cork ï Abbas5: you prob want mouse leave not mouseout -- oh, thank you
[04:30:20] <veganista> queztone: are you waiting for the document to be ready before adding the event handler?
[04:30:30] <Cork> ?mouseleave @ AbbasX2
[04:30:31] <bot-t1> AbbasX2, .mouseleave(handler): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[04:30:34] <Cork> *Abbas|:
[04:31:50] <queztone> veganista, nope
[04:32:18] <Cork> that would explain it
[04:32:30] <Cork> the selector runs before the element exist
[04:32:48] <queztone> hah
[04:32:51] <queztone> cool
[04:32:53] <queztone> now it works
[04:32:59] <queztone> added the doc ready ;d
[04:33:03] <queztone> thanks you guys =]
[04:33:11] <veganista> wrap all your in it
[04:33:18] <veganista> all your code*
[04:33:29] <Cork> that kinda depends
[04:33:33] <Cork> actually
[04:34:24] <veganista> its not the worst practice, mostof the time you want to wait for the dom to be ready
[04:34:30] <veganista> queztone: http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_script#jQuery_noConflict_Wrappers
[04:34:41] <Cork> ya but in some situations it will actually break it in some browsers
[04:34:47] <queztone> so if users try to click it before the document is fully loaded; the click event wont work, right?
[04:35:12] <Cork> queztone: dom ready runs when the dom is parsed
[04:35:19] <Cork> but before the document is rendered
[04:35:29] <Cork> the user CAN'T click it before it triggers
[04:35:31] <queztone> oki
[04:35:37] <queztone> sounds good
[04:36:14] <veganista> i wasn't aware of that Cork, in what situations can it break it?
[04:36:34] <Cork> veganista: if you put your script in the body of the page
[04:36:44] <Cork> it might end up in a race condition in ie browsers
[04:37:17] <Cork> (and yes before i helped ppl with that problem in here i preached the same thing you just did :D )
[04:37:54] <Cork> now days i say use ready if you don't put the code in the body (as src or inlne)
[04:39:06] <veganista> cheers cork
[04:39:12] <ctienrsg> queztone: if you want to learn the basics of jquery in a nutshell use http://try.jquery.com. After I did this, I understood far more of those things and they explain things as AddClass quite well
[04:39:32] <queztone> hehe thanks :)

[04:57:36] <jop008> are there functions within jquery handlng cookies?
[04:59:06] <rohitkav> Hi, Is it possible to have separate div files and call it on a single html file using navigation bar with the css for header and footer being fixed to those div's just like in the example "http://zurb.com/jobs/" site we can see Listings, Design Hiring Tips, About having separate div's called on same page with common header and footer??
[05:00:42] <pfFredd> When I use an ajax function to fetch data from a php script and  print the result to a div like this:$("#countsList").html(response);    the fetched data doesn't have any styling at all even though I echo all the properties for the <ul> at the beginning of the php file like <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true"
[05:01:05] <pfFredd> what am I missing to get the styling properly?
[05:01:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> hi guys so I was trying to center elements in the center of the screen using css3 translations but for some reason it isnt working.
[05:02:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> The formula im using subtracts the offset and then sets the items to the center coordiantes of the screen
[05:02:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/djyXw/
[05:03:12] <ctienrsg> Rohan_Bhangui: stupid question, but isn't this possible without any jscript?
[05:03:14] <jop008> are there functions for sqllite DB?
[05:03:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> how so?
[05:03:56] <ctienrsg> I am quite sure it is
[05:04:13] <ctienrsg> Ask the guys in the #css channel, I am sure they can help you
[05:17:34] <DarkArtist69> how do add a button that will remove float: left from a class and another button that will return it?
[05:19:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> use .css to change the float value
[05:19:16] <Cork> DarkArtist69: add an extra class to your css rules and use that instead
[05:19:31] <Cork> it's normally the cleanest way to solve those problems
[05:19:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> value will be float: none
[05:19:36] <DarkArtist69> right.. thanks :)
[05:19:42] <DarkArtist69> right*
[05:20:04] <Cork> css belongs in the css files not in js, as far as possible
[05:21:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya but than how to do translations?
[05:21:24] <Cork> ?g mdn transision ?
[05:21:24] <b-ot> Cork: transition - CSS | MDN ‚Üí https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/transition
[05:21:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> shit my  bod wrong room
[05:22:00] <Cork> and jquery ui has functions that let you animate classes
[05:22:40] <Cork> but ya, transisions and dynamically changed values is two exceptions
[05:24:18] <jmmy> you guys know how to use ajax with ie 8 & 9.  i mean preventDefault can't be used and the ajax success block doesnt run
[05:25:25] <Cork> jmmy: uh, yes both of those two works fine in ie 6,7,8,9 and 10
[05:26:22] <Cork> jmmy: have you verified that you don't have a script or parser error in the page?
[05:26:28] <Cork> like trailing commas

[06:34:15] <jop008> I have this var db = openDatabase("localaltena", "1.0", "local altena", 200000); now I want to check what is in the database
[06:34:20] <jop008> How to this?
[06:40:01] <Cork> jop008: you're working with indexdb?
[06:40:09] <Cork> or what is openDatabase
[06:40:25] <jop008> using sqllite
[06:40:51] <jop008> so where to find the databasefile?
[06:41:09] <Cork> sqlite?
[06:41:22] <Cork> js don't have a pure sqlite implementation
[06:41:48] <Cork> there is an old proprietary implementation in webkit
[06:41:53] <Cork> but it's been depricated
[06:41:57] <Cork> deprecated even
[06:43:01] <jop008> yep sqllite 3
[06:43:29] <Cork> it won't ever be cross browser, so i would recommend using a modern interface instead
[06:46:36] <jop008> sqllite is x browser
[06:47:00] <jop008> part of HTML5
[06:48:08] <Cork> no sqlite isn't part of the spec
[06:48:24] <Cork> domstorage is, and imagedb is, but not the old sqlite interface
[06:48:31] <Cork> sorry indexdb
[06:49:40] <Cork> the old sqlite interface created a dependency on sqlite3 as the spec didn't specify, so it would give the effect that if a browser moved from sqlite to something else, they would have to emulate even bugs from sqlite3
[06:49:50] <Cork> even ex. mysql wouldn't work
[06:50:10] <Cork> so it was shopped way early in the spec
[06:50:27] <Cork> and domstorage and indexdb was introduced in it's place
[07:25:43] <jop008> what is a good solution for offline db storage preferring sql
[07:26:19] <jop008> we have indexeddb IE and websql for other browsers
[07:27:01] <Cork> uh, no you have indexdb for firefox (they where the ones coming up with the standard), ie10 and chrome
[07:27:14] <Cork> and you would have to have a fallback for opera and safari (in dom storage)
[07:27:31] <Cork> there is libs out there that does this for you
[07:28:29] <Cork> and well opera is a past tense, so everything left to care about is safari

[07:32:27] <UltraMC> How to get element's text in here http://jsfiddle.net/c42Mx/ ?
[07:34:03] <Cork> UltraMC: $('.function_list_sellers_MIEJSCE') ?
[07:34:26] <Cork> or isn't the class uniq (looks like it from the jamble on the end)
[07:34:30] <UltraMC> Cork but I have multiple classes like that
[07:34:39] <Cork> uh, ok
[07:34:55] <Cork> UltraMC: $(this).closest('td').preAll('.function_list_sellers_MIEJSCE')
[07:34:58] <UltraMC> Cork, better example: http://jsfiddle.net/c42Mx/2
[07:36:17] <UltraMC> Cork, `Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'preAll' `
[07:36:40] <UltraMC> Cork @ http://pastebin.com/021q9prd
[07:37:13] <Cork> ... prevAll >_<
[07:37:20] <Cork> missed a v
[07:41:09] <UltraMC> Cork, returns empty string: element.closest('td').prevAll('.function_list_sellers_MIEJSCE').text()
[07:41:25] <boytoy_> back, dunno what happened there
[07:41:36] <boytoy_> Cork: would you recommend I install the jQuery Migrate plugin to restore the toggle() functionality?
[07:42:34] <boytoy_> (from a UX perspective im sure some users will get frustrated since they cant close the menu the same way they opened it and have to click elsewhere on the page)
[07:42:48] <Cork> boytoy_: better is to just replace it with an if case
[07:43:11] <boytoy_> ooh
[07:43:13] <boytoy_> kewl lemme try that..
[07:43:20] <jop008> what is the price for https://www.sequelsphere.com/?
[07:43:25] <jop008> I can't find it
[07:43:43] <Cork> boytoy_: hmm, btw your using it for toggling the element; that should still work
[07:45:10] <boytoy_> really?
[07:45:56] <UltraMC> Cork, the answer was element.find('.function_list_sellers_MIEJSCE').text()
[07:48:10] <Cork> boytoy_: what is it that isn't working?
[07:48:17] <Cork> Boydy: works quite well here
[07:48:37] <Cork> *boytoy_:
[07:49:12] <boytoy_> Cork: well in addition to closing when clicking outside the dropdown menu, it should also close when clicking on the link that opened it
[07:49:14] <Croves> Do I need a <form> tag to upload a file, even when I'm using a jQuery Plugin?
[07:51:13] <boytoy_> Boydy :)
[07:51:30] <boytoy_> Boydy: i hope you're doing fine
[07:52:35] <Cork> boytoy_: it's the bubbling that causes the effect for you
[07:52:55] <Cork> first replace return false; with ev.preventDefault()
[07:53:09] <Cork> and then run ev.stopPropagation when you're showing the element
[07:53:36] <Cork> (and avoid adding the extra event listener if it isn't)
[07:53:41] <jop008> sequel sphere lacks phonegap support
[07:53:42] <Cork> and after that it should work
[07:55:50] <Cork> boytoy_: hmm, no that doesn't work either
[07:56:12] <Cork> boytoy_: actually can't really say why that isn't working
[07:56:28] <Cork> wait a min...
[07:56:30] <Cork> LOL'
[07:56:37] <Cork> you're statically running hide first :D
[07:57:55] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/5/
[08:06:10] <boytoy_> Cork: sorry keyboard jammed again
[08:06:28] <boytoy_> *nice*
[08:06:39] <boytoy_> this is great man, thank you so much
[08:06:39] <Cork> boytoy_: might be time to buy a new keyboard then...
[08:06:51] <Cork> np
[08:07:33] <boytoy_> yeah maybe i should
[08:11:53] <RNT> hi, may i have same help with this pls?
[08:12:03] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/SuCWjSPF
[08:13:20] <Balousen> hey guys, I have some problems with jquery slider widget, I have made it veritical and have 3 sliders, and I need to have them side by side, but I havent manage to. Any advise ? Or would u like to see the code or ? Thank you very much !
[08:16:47] <RNT> Balousen, you may want to see this page: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/jquery-volumn-slider/
[08:17:31] <Balousen> RNT thx I will investigate imediatly :)
[08:18:00] <RNT> see the css part
[08:18:20] <ryorky1> is it possible to render a layout and format,html and format.json in a respond_to?
[08:22:10] <sacho> ..what
[08:24:34] <sal002> On the tablesorter plugin - I have an issue with large numbers not sorting right - see www.coinchoose.com
[08:28:08] <Cork> ryorky1: that sounds like it was meant for another channel
[08:28:24] <ryorky1> cork: nope
[08:28:41] <Cork> jquery doens't have a respond_to function
[08:29:12] <Balousen> RNT can I contact you in private chat ?
[08:29:30] <RNT> safe
[08:29:57] <Balousen> safe ? :-)
[08:30:07] <RNT> sure you can :)
[08:30:20] <ryorky1> Cork:  I'm trying to use jquery file upload and jquery treetable, but the format.json and the render layout(or the js for the treetable seem to confilct.  can't figure out why though)
[08:32:34] <Cork> ryorky1: what format.json are you talking about?
[08:32:51] <Cork> sounds like your mixing in server code in the subject
[08:33:38] <sal002> anyone here use tablesorter?
[08:33:43] <RNT> i need a little help with this code: http://pastebin.com/SuCWjSPF
[08:33:46] <PREFIX|> is there any downside of doing something like domobject.on('click', { param: data }, function( event ) { MyFunc( event ) } ) ?
[08:34:44] <Cork> PREFIX|: not really, if that is all you're doing it is not needed though
[08:34:48] <nixee> is there a reason why this menu is not dropping down? I thought my code was correct: http://jsfiddle.net/4pRE8/2/
[08:35:13] <Cork> PREFIX|: domobject.on('click', { param: data }, MyFunc }) would do the same thing
[08:35:19] <Cork> opps
[08:35:29] <Cork> PREFIX|: * domobject.on('click', { param: data }, MyFunc)
[08:36:12] <PREFIX|> ah cool didn't know
[08:36:19] <PREFIX|> but Im guessing there is no downside to it? I just find it cleaner
[08:36:48] <Cork> it will create an extra scope, and that costs a little, but no normally it doesn't matter
[08:37:15] <Cork> as your creating an anonymous function to then from it call a function
[08:37:21] <Cork> instead of just calling the target function
[08:37:49] <PREFIX|> ah I meant as in there is no downside to use a target function over an anonymous function
[08:38:07] <PREFIX|> I just don't like nesting functions like that if you get what I mean
[08:38:10] <Cork> an, no none
[08:38:35] <Cork> though you're taking the penalty of anonymous function with your code
[08:38:43] <Cork> so you're better of just removing that part
[08:39:12] <PREFIX|> ye i did
[08:39:19] <Cork> function clickHandler(event) {}   ... $().on('click, clickHandler);
[08:39:41] <PREFIX|> actually ended with: streams[len - 1].hoverFrame.on('mouseenter', { streamFrame: StreamFrame, displayFrame: DisplayFrame }, showStream);
[08:39:46] <PREFIX|> not the prettiest code but it works as intended =D
[08:49:21] <wilkinsmc> man, that code is detestible
[08:49:33] <wilkinsmc> i wouldn't use that code if it would save the would from super mutants
[08:49:44] <wilkinsmc> world
[08:50:39] <Stephen> See....
[08:50:45] <Stephen> Now I have to ask for a link
[08:51:02] <Stephen> wilkinsmc: Can you do the honors?
[08:51:26] <Stephen> Your intro would make an excellent blog teaser
[08:52:02] <PREFIX|> haha wilkinsmc, my code?
[08:52:09] <wilkinsmc> ya
[08:52:14] <wilkinsmc> scroll up like 20
[08:52:23] <wilkinsmc> <PREFIX|> actually ended with: streams[len - 1].hoverFrame.on('mouseenter', { streamFrame: StreamFrame, displayFrame: DisplayFrame }, showStream);
[08:52:24] <wilkinsmc> <PREFIX|> not the prettiest code but it works as intended =D
[08:52:33] <PREFIX|> what about it
[08:52:39] <PREFIX|> the streams[len -1] part I guess
[08:53:30] <Stephen> I'm still suprised that Array doesn't implement a .First() or a .Last() function
[08:53:53] <Stephen> You could always use a library, but that's just syntactic sugar
[08:54:04] <PREFIX|> for all intents and purposes
[08:54:13] <PREFIX|> I could set the ".on" part on hoverFrame before adding it to array
[08:55:04] <PREFIX|> but I'm interested in what parts wilkinsmc finds detestible
[09:01:27] <Randomage> hey everyone
[09:03:56] <Randomage> quick question, I have an url structure like example.com/xx/foo/bar/, I'd like to have a select to change the page language (the xx is the 2 letters code for the language), any guide to do that?
[09:09:33] <Inspiral> can somebody help me out with this really simple fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Ppj8P/ - I am trying to stop mouseout triggering if the mouseout is triggered on child elements (i am using an old jquery library so am stuck with this method for the time being)
[09:11:46] <Stephen> Randomage: Look into Google Translate's API
[09:12:08] <Randomage> I don't need help in translating the page
[09:12:12] <Randomage> I'm able to do that
[09:12:49] <Randomage> if example.com/en/ is requested I serve it in english, if example.com/fr/, in french.
[09:13:02] <Randomage> I just need an elegant way to swap between those.
[09:13:16] <Stephen> Inspiral: On the child elements add .on("mouseout",function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); });
[09:14:25] <rue> Randomage: What are you trying to solve, the URL change, or the effect of the URL?
[09:14:25] <Stephen> Inspiral: better: .on("mouseout",function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); return false; });
[09:15:37] <Inspiral> i believe .on doesnt exist i am using 1.3.2
[09:15:56] <Randomage> pretty much everything, I'm still in the concept phase.
[09:16:24] <Randomage> I'm not even sure it's the most elegant solution, but the language switcher in the skype.com homepage seemed to do well
[09:18:53] <Randomage> or maybe I should use a formatted list of links and do the hiding/showing via js.
[09:22:27] <Inspiral> also Stephen,:"Since the .live() method handles events once they have propagated to the top of the document, it is not possible to stop propagation of live events."
[09:23:32] <Stephen> Inspiral: upgrade, 1.3.2 is waay to old
[09:23:42] <Inspiral> i cant as it will break other things :(
[09:23:52] <Stephen> But, it doesn't matter
[09:25:20] <Stephen> $(elements).each(function() { this.onmouseout=function(event) { event.stopPropagation(); return false; }; );
[09:25:46] <Stephen> But, yes, live is a problem
[09:25:51] <Stephen> So, a second option
[09:26:09] <Inspiral> could i apply a newer jquery with the noconflict option?
[09:26:33] <Stephen> In the .live handler, wrap the code in a conditional that checks for a class only the children have
[09:26:51] <Inspiral> like i did in the fiddle ?
[09:27:53] <boytoy_> Cork: about http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/5/ how do i make it open only one dropdown at a time like the old one at http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/3/ ?
[09:28:36] <Stephen> Inspiral: http://jsfiddle.net/Ppj8P/2/
[09:28:40] <Stephen> Check the first one
[09:28:48] <Stephen> That's the proper way
[09:30:39] <Inspiral> Stephen: thanks, I made the additional changes but that doesnt seem to trigger at all
[09:30:40] <Inspiral> http://jsfiddle.net/Ppj8P/3/
[09:34:48] <boytoy_> At http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/5/ -- anybody know how to make it only open one dropdown menu at a time?
[09:34:55] <Stephen> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/7/
[09:35:06] <boytoy_> damn
[09:35:19] <boytoy_> that was fast
[09:36:11] <boytoy_> Stephen: unfortunately with that one, the dropdown won't close again when you click the link
[09:38:00] <mehwork> i notice with javascript people tend to put their code in individual functions, but with jquery they just do  $('#foo').bar(..);   $('#bla').blah()
[09:38:48] <mehwork> is it considered overkill to put both of those inside their own javascript functions?
[09:45:39] <RNT> i need a little help with this code: http://pastebin.com/SuCWjSPF
[09:47:30] <Balousen> hey guys, I need some help with css, I have those 3 sliders below each others, but I need them side by side, any one who have a minute ? You can see my issue here: http://rntplayer.com/Test/t/New.html
[09:50:02] <Z3R0> float right; float left; ?
[09:50:51] <Balousen> Z3R0 was it me u replied to ?
[09:50:58] <RNT> yes
[09:51:27] <Z3R0> put the sliders into their own div and float right or left each one
[09:52:06] <Balousen> Z3R0 we have already tried float right etc in the css
[09:53:23] <RNT> he used "insert after" i'm not sure if is still possible to separe the slider div from the box
[09:53:35] <Balousen> we need 3 vertical sliders side by side, but it does not seems possible because of the div it uses
[09:54:05] <PREFIX|> of course its possible
[09:54:06] <Stephen> Inspiral: Note that borders collapse
[09:54:36] <Stephen> You can't separate the event of an element moving out of the main element from the children in this setup
[09:55:13] <Z3R0> if you could put it into a fiddle I could do it
[09:57:06] <Balousen> http://jsfiddle.net/vxG3t/
[09:57:10] <Balousen> there u go :)
[09:57:38] <PREFIX|> how exactly do you want it to look
[09:57:42] <PREFIX|> i already got the 3 bars next to eachother
[09:58:03] <Inspiral> ok Stephen i have given up on that method and gone with 1.9.1 using noConflict() to run this piece of code however, on() is not applying to dynamic content loaded afterwards
[09:59:48] <Balousen> PREFIX| that was **** fast :-) We need the 3 bars next to each others, and then I need the dropdowns to go away and just have a label text like: Tale: and then it shows the count for that bar... u follow me ?
[09:59:58] <Balousen> and need to be vertical
[10:00:32] <PREFIX|> just add float:left or float:right to the div with the sliders and they'll float together
[10:01:11] <PREFIX|> http://jsfiddle.net/hjvyB/ that of course isn't controlled, but it shows you how they end up together
[10:01:23] <PREFIX|> you could just put all 3 sliders inside a div, too
[10:01:26] <Z3R0> fiddle didn't load sliders
[10:01:35] <darkmutt> question when i have a thumbnail picture and upon clicking it it becomes big and centered on the screen but still i stay on the sme page
[10:01:39] <darkmutt> how do i call that?XD
[10:01:43] <Z3R0> well looks like prefix is already on it ;)
[10:01:54] <PREFIX|> i dont get why you add each slider to a DOM object like that though
[10:01:57] <boytoy_> darkmutt: lightbox
[10:02:49] <darkmutt> thank you boytoy_ i didn't even have an idea s to what should i look for before
[10:02:49] <boytoy_> darkmutt: check the "Photo lightbox" at http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/popup/
[10:02:50] <Balousen> PREFIX| thx a million I will go and get it to work ! it¬¥s my first time with jquery
[10:03:02] <PREFIX|> honestly it's not really jquery, it's css =)
[10:03:14] <boytoy_> darkmutt: r u mixed race by any chance?
[10:03:25] <Balousen> but quite hard to have the overview how to get it all to work first time
[10:03:25] <PREFIX|> nonetheless, if you want to group all sliders, the easiest is to add all 3 sliders to the same div and just control the size/position of that div
[10:03:30] <PREFIX|> indeed
[10:03:33] <darkmutt> no i'm from poland, although why the question is making me wonder??
[10:03:54] <boytoy_> darkmutt: ah well
[10:04:00] <boytoy_> darkmutt: a "mutt" means a mixed race dog
[10:04:08] <boytoy_> darkmutt: obama refers to himself as a mutt
[10:04:13] <jop008> what is a good text  container for jQM
[10:04:24] <jop008> a text block with information
[10:04:33] <darkmutt> xD i like dogs i dislike authorities and i don't believe in any race whether human or not being more or less important
[10:04:46] <boytoy_> yeah :)
[10:04:51] <boytoy_> each race has its own niche
[10:05:13] <boytoy_> i believe they're different and stereotypically good at their own thing -- but none are better than the other
[10:05:45] <PREFIX|> but there are individuals within a species that are superior
[10:05:48] <boytoy_> (somehow nature managed to even out the scores)
[10:05:48] <darkmutt> exactly the thing even the most hated things 'say mosquitos/druggies' have their own reason to live
[10:06:14] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: well i think those individuals just have a superior way of thinking
[10:06:16] <darkmutt> how are they superior PREFIX| ??
[10:06:31] <darkmutt> physically? who says the others aren't better in different things?
[10:06:37] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: and over the years their brain's "neuroplasticity" (quite the new field of science) helps make them even better
[10:08:48] <PREFIX|> some individuals are simply better
[10:08:52] <Stephen> Inspiral: AH, found it
[10:09:00] <PREFIX|> No genetic diseases for example
[10:09:01] <Stephen> Inspiral: e.toElement
[10:09:09] <PREFIX|> stronger genes, intellect, and so forth
[10:09:15] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: it fluctuates, they can be top dogs one sec and beggars the next
[10:09:19] <PREFIX|> not really no
[10:09:22] <delvinj> or, ability to make delicious waffles
[10:09:24] <Inspiral> you have it working ?
[10:09:38] <darkmutt> i have to disagree PREFIX| with the idea of simply better and i do not believe in that while i do believe that genetic disease doesn't make a person better or worse simply flawed in such and such aspects
[10:10:02] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: genetic research also shows that genes change over time, stronger qualities can emerge out of nowhere but they can also fade away
[10:10:26] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics
[10:10:33] <PREFIX|> and that happens in one generation?
[10:10:35] <PREFIX|> no it doesn't
[10:10:40] <jop008> A good tip for a good css style editor on oSx?
[10:10:43] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: it can happen in a month
[10:10:52] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: i got a masters in this shit bruv
[10:11:16] <PREFIX|> so you're saying in a month a genetic disparaty that is superior will suddenly be reviled as the top in the current human population?
[10:11:23] <darkmutt> and i've got a masters in being sick xD well not really but judging from how long and often i was some even said i should be dead now ;p
[10:11:41] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: it's been known to happen in certain individuals yes
[10:11:49] <boytoy_> and we also have ways of stimulating it artificially now
[10:12:02] <darkmutt> PREFIX|, think autistic ppl they are known to be unable to function in the society but they can also be absolute geniuses in the given fields they love
[10:12:30] <Stephen> Inspiral: http://jsfiddle.net/Ppj8P/23/
[10:13:31] <PREFIX|> boytoy_ really? Show me an example of how someone suddenly in a month genetically mutated from a beta/omega to an alpha in todays society
[10:13:49] <PREFIX|> darkmutt: And? That doesn't make them genetically desirable
[10:14:04] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: alpha and beta are psychological traits
[10:14:26] <PREFIX|> and?
[10:14:29] <boytoy_> PREFIX|: those u can change in 1 second
[10:14:33] <PREFIX|> no you can not
[10:14:42] <PREFIX|> and sociopathy/psychopathy?
[10:14:47] <PREFIX|> genetics vs environment
[10:14:56] <boytoy_> im talking about genetic qualities not psychological qualities
[10:15:08] <boytoy_> well whether or not u can better urself in 1 second or 1 year depends entirely on your own motivation i guess
[10:15:20] <boytoy_> pick up a selfhelp book or some shit
[10:15:26] <PREFIX|> not to mention, a fit 190cm tall male vs a 160tall man with gastric issues? likelyhood of alpha traits for a female?
[10:15:28] <boytoy_> u apparently wanna become alpha and i cant help u with that
[10:15:58] <PREFIX|> I'm not refering to myself
[10:16:09] <boytoy_> ooooooooooooh
[10:16:10] <PREFIX|> so why you're talking about me is not understandable
[10:16:12] <boytoy_> u r so busted :P
[10:16:35] <PREFIX|> You shouldn't make assumptions
[10:16:40] <PREFIX|> as you're obviously out on deep water atm
[10:16:55] <boytoy_> take a chill pill man, wtf u on about deep waters =)
[10:17:26] <PREFIX|> Again you're making assumptions =)
[10:17:28] <jop008> Advice on a free OSx css editor?
[10:17:46] <boytoy_> im what now?
[10:19:00] <darkmutt> boytoy_, i would be interested in talking with you more often, a person with an open mind, logical facts, knowledge and will to gain more is always interesting to talk to :D
[10:19:36] <PREFIX|> lol
[10:20:38] <boytoy_> darkmutt: i appreciate that my brother
[10:43:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> jop008: what do you mean css editor√â you mean a text editor in general or√â
[10:44:58] <jop008> css with example of how it will look like like .info { font-size:0.8em; }
[10:45:09] <jop008> now it is trying and error
[10:45:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> ??
[10:52:08] <PREFIX|> he wants a WYSIWYG editor for css kinda
[10:52:17] <PREFIX|> he wants to edit things in CSS and see them in realtime in a "view" pane
[10:52:18] <PREFIX|> im guessing
[10:53:08] <PREFIX|> jop008: why not use one of the many online versions? like http://cssizer.com/
[10:53:22] <PREFIX|> or http://scratchpad.io/
[11:05:09] <Pinkamena_D> can anyone tell why this code does not work with the latest jquery? :http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/fit-iframe-to-content/
[11:09:21] <Cork> Pinkamena_D: $.browser has been removed
[11:09:31] <Cork> it's been deprecated for a few versions now
[11:12:55] <boytoy_> yo Cork, mind if I hit u with this real quick
[11:13:09] <boytoy_> how to make http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/5/ only open one dropdown menu at a time?
[11:13:09] <boytoy_> I guess I could add $('.foo ul').hide(); before "var bar", but each menu wouldn't close as the other one opens
[11:14:11] <PREFIX|> tell all to close before opening 1? or save who last opened, tell it to close before opening new
[11:22:12] <Cork> boytoy_: got something i got to take care of, but can look after that
[11:23:36] <Inspiral> Stephen: thanks for helping earlier, i abandoned the whole thing and added the latest jquery with jquery.noconflict() - Everything works now as intended!
[11:23:43] <boytoy_> Cork: much appreciated
[11:23:57] <Inspiral> hey Cork ya didnt tell me about noconflict hehehe
[11:33:23] <Cork> Inspiral: uh?
[11:33:39] <Cork> Inspiral: not sure about what context you're talking about there
[11:34:00] <Cork> noconflict helps for third party library, but it is a bad fit for different versions of jquery
[11:34:06] <Cork> not sure witch one was you
[11:34:15] <Cork> boytoy_: so, can look now
[11:36:50] <boytoy_> Cork: cool
[11:37:35] <Cork> boytoy_: so what was the problem?
[11:37:52] <Cork> ah, you linked it up there
[11:38:05] <boytoy_> yep its right up there
[11:39:44] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/16/
[11:40:04] <boytoy_> 16?!?
[11:40:15] <boytoy_> ooh thanks dude
[11:40:23] <Cork> though honestly the toggle makes it a bit pointless at this stage
[11:40:27] <Cork> one sec
[11:40:40] <boytoy_> freakin' marvellous
[11:42:34] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/18/
[11:42:41] <Cork> i like that one a bit better
[11:43:14] <Cork> opps missed a part
[11:43:22] <boytoy_> Cork: hehe yeah it doesnt close
[11:43:26] <boytoy_> i mean if u click on say More
[11:43:32] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/19/
[11:43:39] <Cork> ya, i missed to remove the not part :)
[11:44:45] <boytoy_> elegant and relevant
[11:44:52] <Cork> uh... sorry my head is in a mess
[11:44:58] <boytoy_> heaven-sent eloquence
[11:44:58] <Cork> that's totally wrong >_<
[11:45:04] <Stephen> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/21/
[11:45:34] <Stephen> damn
[11:45:38] <Stephen> Did someone beat me?
[11:45:45] <Cork> you missed the click outside part
[11:46:17] <boytoy_> coolest thing on earth for me right now thanks a lot guys
[11:46:31] <Cork> boytoy_: http://jsfiddle.net/ndqKj/22/
[11:46:37] <Cork> there that one FINALLY works...
[11:46:45] <Inspiral> <Cork> Inspiral: not sure about what context you're talking about there << yesterday you were trying to help me with some v1.3.2 stuff :)
[11:46:48] <Cork> i blame this messed up day :/
[11:47:09] <boytoy_> wait ok i see what u did
[11:47:20] <boytoy_> not bad
[11:47:45] <Cork> Inspiral: ah, ya and the reason i didn't mention the noconflict is cause as  both are jquery, they will both write to the jQuery object
[11:47:57] <Cork> Inspiral: so it has a tendency to be messed up
[11:48:26] <Cork> Inspiral: noconflict works well for running jquery on the same page as another framework
[11:48:29] <Inspiral> oh..i got it working ok 'apparently' i assigned a var instead of $
[11:48:39] <Inspiral> so instead of $() i do jq() :)
[11:48:41] <Cork> but it; to my experience works quite bad with copies of jquery
[11:48:55] <Inspiral> i am not going to complain in this instance :)
[11:49:01] <Cork> Inspiral: sure, but that part isn't the probem
[11:49:23] <Cork> it's that plugins expect jQuery to be "safe"
[11:49:37] <Cork> and in you're case you don't know if its 1.3 or 1.x
[11:49:46] <Inspiral> ah - well, my situation is so far so good
[11:49:55] <Cork> finger crossed :)
[11:49:56] <Inspiral> all features appear to work
[11:49:58] <Inspiral> ya :)
[11:50:18] <Cork> anyway that is why i didn't mention it
[11:50:30] <Inspiral> although mouseleave() is a bit iffy when i move the mouse too fast but i am sure i can work that out
[11:50:56] <boytoy_> one day imma buy Cork a yacht
[11:51:03] <boytoy_> he can have one of my private islands as well
[11:51:10] <Cork> lol
[11:54:30] <wilkinsmc> internet explorer's being a bitch
[11:54:39] <wilkinsmc> active x blocking my jquery
[11:54:40] <wilkinsmc> wtf
[11:54:41] <wilkinsmc> oh well
[11:54:48] <wilkinsmc> i spent all this time making my website interactive and cool looking
[11:54:59] <wilkinsmc> and internet explorer has to fuck it up, even with all the options i had to turn on for it
[11:55:01] <wilkinsmc> runs slow
[11:55:51] <morfin> hello
[11:57:10] <wilkinsmc> f u morfin
[11:57:20] <morfin> you too
[11:57:45] <Cork> wilkinsmc: everything is activex in ie, even javascript
[11:57:48] <Cork> and... xml
[11:57:58] <Cork> (well special characters in xml at least)
[11:58:00] <morfin> because IE sucks
[11:58:20] <Cork> depends actually, newer ones are ok
[11:58:43] <morfin> i think only 10+ works "properly"
[11:58:44] <Cork> (not that i would run it as my normal browser to save my life)
[11:58:58] <Cork> ya
[11:59:15] <morfin> i have a problem: i have a  table which have 3 columns, i am binding click for cells in last column using on(this event replaces text in that cell with select which have value as cell had)
[11:59:29] <Cork> ie9 is the first one that you can get functioning ok
[11:59:36] <Cork> and 10 is the one where it mostly works
[12:00:32] <morfin> and i want to remove select when you click everywhere but not to that select but i've got a problem: if i bind event removing select to * when i click to that select it removes
[12:00:57] <morfin> because event handler for td is being called
[12:01:20] <morfin> if i do not bind event handler to td tr event handler will run
[12:01:22] <Cork> morfin: use event.stopPropagation() to the td's event handler
[12:01:29] <Cork> s/to/in/
[12:01:32] <morfin> i did
[12:01:54] <morfin> i think they broke jQuery 2
[12:02:29] <morfin> because logics which worked before now do not work
[12:02:36] <wilkinsmc> my arrows wont rotate in firefox, my menu won't work in ie
[12:02:51] <wilkinsmc> at least my animations mostly work in everything
[12:02:52] <tw2113> jQuery 2 was a massive update
[12:03:18] <tw2113> due to the removal of IE8 and down support
[12:03:25] <morfin> i think it was massive fail: "let's break over 9000 applications"
[12:03:43] <tw2113> citation needed
[12:04:10] <magixx32> I am trying to get the width of items inside hidden tabs of jquery-ui, my example is here http://jsbin.com/anesif/1, i tried adding .ui-tabs .ui-tabs-hide{position: absolute; left: -10000px;} to my css like it says at the end of http://ui-dev.jquery.com/demos/tabs/ but that does nothing
[12:04:26] <tw2113> from what i've seen, they did a lot to help with migration to 2.0
[12:04:35] <Cork> morfin: WFM http://jsfiddle.net/PK28Y/
[12:04:38] <tw2113> and they knew not everyone would be able to move to it
[12:05:02] <Cork> tw2113: no, that's not totally correct
[12:05:08] <Cork> 1.9 was a quite massive update
[12:05:12] <magixx32> what do i need to do to get the proper width and not just 0 because the display: none is in effect for hidden tabs
[12:05:19] <Cork> 2.0 is 100% compatible with it
[12:05:24] <tw2113> correct me, master :D
[12:05:26] <Cork> with all old ie sruff removed
[12:05:39] <Cork> 1.9 is the one the migration libs help with
[12:05:59] <Cork> 2.0 is 1.9 - ie8 and below
[12:06:00] <tw2113> ah
[12:06:10] <tw2113> i'm off a step
[12:06:18] <Cork> and 1.9 and 2.0 has the same support range
[12:06:31] <Cork> so 2.0 doesn't make 1.9 obsolete
[12:06:43] <tw2113> so....2.0 was an enema
[12:06:45] <morfin> anyway probably i'll move to ExtJS later(i like their visual stuff which i need to users)
[12:07:18] <morfin> i think i'll use jquery anyway but not like i now do
[12:07:20] <Cork> tw2113: http://blog.jquery.com/2013/03/01/jquery-2-0-beta-2-released/
[12:07:40] <Cork> tw2113: the two libs is built to run side by side
[12:07:44] <tw2113> i'm still trying to get 2.0 into WordPress core
[12:07:55] <tw2113> not sure that will happen
[12:07:58] <Cork> tw2113: that sounds a bit early if you ask me
[12:08:11] <tw2113> i proposed putting it in as well as 1.9
[12:08:12] <Cork> wait another ~10 months and it should be easy
[12:08:24] <tw2113> allow frontend people to use it if they don't need IE
[12:09:40] <morfin> hehe they removed IE8 support
[12:09:46] <morfin> just noticed that
[12:09:49] <Cork> heh that reminds me a bug i saw a live.com user post on mozillas bug tracker :)
[12:11:21] <morfin> btw stupid companies are using Windows XP and i think IE 8
[12:11:49] <tw2113> i wonder how many employees inside MS still use XP
[12:11:51] <wilkinsmc> well, i'm trying to get a computer repair site up, and most of my customers are going to be using old browsers
[12:11:54] <tw2113> or if they force everyone to the latest
[12:12:07] <morfin> and we can't change that because they do not trust anything
[12:12:12] <morfin> they can't even update IE
[12:13:44] <morfin> Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0)
[12:14:08] <morfin> that's what i see in access.log =(
[12:14:29] <morfin> can you tell me what extactly they removed?
[12:14:47] <morfin> *exactly
[12:14:57] <wilkinsmc> i have a feeling most of my problems are due to preloading
[12:15:12] <Cork> morfin: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=857737
[12:15:14] <wilkinsmc> my border images aren't being moved by jquery in browsers outside of chrome
[12:15:48] <Cork> morfin: just cool it out winxp will die in a few months
[12:16:12] * geekbuntu a shame xp is the only thing they ever built that worked
[12:16:16] <tw2113> unless they extend support again
[12:16:25] <tw2113> and even then, support EOL doesn't mean people move away
[12:16:33] <Cork> geekbuntu: win2k was better if you ask me
[12:16:48] <geekbuntu> Cork: for the common user - xp rocked
[12:16:52] <geekbuntu> still does
[12:16:55] <morfin> i was win2k
[12:17:04] <geekbuntu> which is why they discontinued it i'm sure
[12:17:07] <morfin> it was a revolution i think :D
[12:17:07] <Cork> tw2113: EOL date + 2h and a huge list of exploits gets published
[12:17:07] <geekbuntu> (j/k)
[12:17:14] <morfin> long time ago
[12:17:35] <Cork> tw2113: historically thats been true and most likely will for xp too
[12:17:37] <tw2113> cause you know, end users see those posts
[12:18:09] <tw2113> i'm confrontational today or something, wtf is up with me
[12:18:16] <Cork> end users; no but it means companies looks on an os that's hit EOL like it's plage
[12:18:17] <morfin> hmmm
[12:18:22] <Cork> and thats where it matters
[12:18:33] <Cork> cause those are the ones that doesn't update there browsers
[12:18:36] <geekbuntu> Cork: truth is - if they let ie6/7/8 hang on for that long - xp could be extended
[12:18:45] <morfin> as i said
[12:18:46] <geekbuntu> but then again - i think the world should switch to ubuntu
[12:18:46] <Cork> geekbuntu: could be?
[12:18:52] <geekbuntu> meh - who knows
[12:18:56] <tw2113> meh, ubuntu
[12:18:58] <Cork> xp has been extended for 8 years i think
[12:18:59] <morfin> i know some companies which use IE8
[12:19:04] * tw2113 is a fedora person when not on osx
[12:19:19] <Stephen> Umm, what?
[12:19:23] <Cork> it has been extended more times then any other os
[12:19:26] <geekbuntu> i use osx, but have parallels ubuntu as an interface
[12:19:42] <morfin> Windows XP should end
[12:19:45] <Cork> and it has the longest support time of all ms softwars
[12:19:46] <Stephen> Cork: Are you speaking "overall", or did it get extended again?
[12:19:56] <Cork> morfin: april 8 2014
[12:20:02] <RNT> CAN somebody take a look at:http://pastebin.com/jDpvPH8H
[12:20:08] <Stephen> AS400 folks
[12:20:12] <morfin> hmm
[12:20:15] <Stephen> Still upgrades to this day ;-)
[12:20:17] <Cork> Stephen: released 2001 eol 2014
[12:20:29] <Cork> that's a looooong support time
[12:20:58] <geekbuntu> RNT:  try $(oDropdown).close();

[12:21:30] <geekbuntu> Cork:  lol
[12:21:32] <morfin> shit
[12:21:36] <morfin> 331 days
[12:21:46] <RNT> I'll try, just a sec, thx guys
[12:21:52] <geekbuntu> hope it works
[12:22:08] <Cork> geekbuntu: it will, ms has more or less already stopped supporting it
[12:22:19] <Cork> it WILL die 2014
[12:22:55] <geekbuntu> i do not know, but i suspect if it had SP3 - support may go on longer‚Ä¶. but if they support it service packs 1 & 2 have to be supported
[12:23:07] <geekbuntu> *if SP3 was the original release
[12:23:11] <geekbuntu> huge RPC issues
[12:23:38] <Cork> geekbuntu: sp2 has already hit eol if i remember correctly
[12:23:48] <geekbuntu> Cork: you're prolly right
[12:23:56] <geekbuntu> i'm 49 - memory is going
[12:23:56] <RNT> geekbuntu, '$ ODropdown' is undefined
[12:24:00] <RNT> (
[12:24:05] * geekbuntu along with other things
[12:24:32] <geekbuntu> RNT: can you put-up link again?
[12:24:34] <geekbuntu> pastebin
[12:24:36] <morfin> oh shi*
[12:24:43] <Cork> geekbuntu: July 13, 2010
[12:24:46] <morfin> extjs costs so much :O
[12:24:47] <geekbuntu> nvm - had in memory
[12:24:54] <Cork> do sp2 has been unsupported for 3 years
[12:25:43] <RNT> geekbuntu, http://pastebin.com/jDpvPH8H
[12:25:46] <geekbuntu> RNT: it's a guess - but it looks like a scope issue - try setting it above the try e.g. var oDropdown...
[12:25:57] <geekbuntu> use the word 'var'
[12:26:00] <geekbuntu> to set it
[12:26:59] <magixx32> I am trying to get the width of items inside hidden tabs of jquery-ui, my example is here http://jsbin.com/anesif/2/edit, i tried setting visibility to none and unhiding but that does nothing, what do i need to do to get the proper width and not just 0 because the display: none is in effect for hidden tabs
[12:28:17] <RNT> no, the oDropdown is reconized, an alert(oDropdown); it will give me object object,
[12:29:05] <RNT> it's property "close" is not reconized
[12:29:35] <geekbuntu> RNT: let me see if i can paste it/try it
[12:29:51] <Stephen> magixx32: As long as display:none is there, the width will be 0
[12:30:02] <Stephen> visibility:hidden
[12:30:19] <RNT> ok
[12:30:42] <magixx32> i did set visibility to hidden
[12:30:53] <magixx32> and called .hide() on the tab
[12:31:32] <Stephen> magixx32: You could instead make it visible, but give the real tab a higher z-index
[12:31:52] <Stephen> .hide() puts display:none back
[12:32:36] <Stephen> magixx32: Can you explain more why you are trying to get the width of a hidden element? Maybe there is another approach
[12:33:07] <magixx32> ok... so hide does not have the same functionality as toggle
[12:33:16] <magixx32> adding show at the start is needed
[12:33:18] <magixx32> and worked
[12:33:32] <Stephen> :-)
[12:35:15] <magixx32> but basically i am clicking something in a tab, images load in another, and i need them centered and side by side which currently requires the total width of the images in order to achieve that
[12:36:55] <PREFIX|> why not just enforce a static width/height
[12:38:41] <Stephen> my guess is because magixx32 is loading the images from a 3rd party :-)
[12:39:15] <Stephen> Centering algorithms like that can get hairly, and it never looks as nice as static sizing
[12:39:19] <Stephen> However
[12:39:53] <Stephen> The proper way to handle it is to get the size from the actual image object
[12:40:10] <magixx32> images are dynamically loaded and their width is determined by a height-max
[12:40:14] <Stephen> If you are scaling them s
[12:40:24] <nFFF> Im looking to achieve animations like on : http://www.loropiana.com/flash.html#/lang:en/home/Bugatti is it possible without flash?
[12:41:18] <Stephen> magixx32: Images dynamically loaded is ok
[12:42:24] <Stephen> height-max is okay too, but is their container 100% or something?
[12:43:55] <Stephen> but, to make them centered+sidebyside:
[12:44:18] <magixx32> the divs are tabs-5>imageDisplay>leftImage+right Image
[12:44:42] <magixx32> imageDisplay img has the maxheight
[12:44:53] <magixx32> right and left image float left
[12:44:57] <Stephen> yup
[12:45:27] <Stephen> is there any way to determine what maxHeight is ?
[12:45:28] <magixx32> then image display has an auto overflow, left&right margins
[12:45:39] <Stephen> I'm assuming it's pdeserializeUser
[12:45:42] <Stephen> Sorry
[12:45:44] <magixx32> i set max-height to 800 or whatever
[12:45:57] <magixx32> in css
[12:46:48] <Stephen> So you actually scale them all the way to 800 height then, and let it horizontal scroll?
[12:47:10] <Stephen> Or you're scaling until 1 of the 2 meets an edge?
[12:47:14] <Stephen> h/w
[12:47:30] <RNT> this one guys, still unsolved:
[12:47:44] <RNT> http://pastebin.com/jDpvPH8H
[12:50:12] <morfin> i forgot
[12:50:23] <morfin> MIT forces me to publish my sources?
[12:50:47] <morfin> i think no but not sure already
[12:51:09] <morfin> all that licenses messed up in my head :(
[12:51:34] <magixx32> im scailing them to 800 height, then i set the imageDisplay width to the total width of the two images combined, so that no scrolling is necessary, and if the user resizes the window the images will still be side-by-side
[12:52:27] <TheWebNomad> morfin: http://www.tldrlegal.com/
[12:52:39] <Stephen> RNT: msDropDown() doesn't return anything
[12:53:07] <RNT> Stephen, why?
[12:53:16] <morfin> all that MIT LGPL GPL Apache licences are hell :D
[12:53:31] <Stephen> Because that's what the source says
[12:53:42] <Stephen> There is no "return" at the end of that function
[12:53:52] <morfin> ow cool resource)
[12:53:54] <Stephen> just means you need to grab the reference yourself
[12:56:30] <Stephen> RNT: $('#list .selector').dd().close()
[12:56:34] <Stephen> Try that instead
[12:56:43] <RNT> ok
[12:56:54] <Stephen> If you want that reference to stick around
[12:57:36] <Stephen> $('#list .selector').msDropDown(); oDropdown = $('#list .selector').dd()
[12:57:53] <Stephen> Then you might be able to do oDropdown.close()
[12:57:56] <morfin> so
[13:00:13] <magixx32> what would happen if I use a multiple selector for load like, $(#a, #b).load(function ...), will the function get run once both a&b have loaded once or will it it get called twice as each a&b load?
[13:03:24] <Stephen> multiple selectors scope
[13:03:38] <Stephen> it's like saying $("#b #a")
[13:04:20] <Stephen> You'd need $([$('#a'),$('#b')]).load()
[13:06:58] <morfin> hmmm
[13:07:22] <morfin> looks like i need to develop everything to use in commercial software :D
[13:07:34] <morfin> using jQuery
[13:12:46] <russinkung> peol: test test
[13:12:55] <peol> woopwoop
[13:15:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> is it possible to get offset of a particular element relative to a sibling?
[13:16:00] <peol> Rohan_Bhangui, just do .offset() on both and remove the values from the first one
[13:16:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[13:16:41] <fikst> Rohan_Bhangui, or use position()
[13:17:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> but thats^ relative to the offset parent
[13:17:14] <peol> fikst, that's not relative to a sibling
[13:17:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya^
[13:17:37] <fikst> jup, missed the sibling part there...
[13:17:43] <peol> ^^

[13:18:36] <iaj> Hey there, for all divs with class .absource I want to make <div class="absource">...</div> ‚ûî <div class="main-border"><div class="absource">...</div><div class="upper-right"></div><div class="left-side"></div>   some easy way to do that?
[13:20:00] <peol> RNT, just running .msDropdown() will still return the jQuery object, you need to fetch the data after instantiation. From the top of their docs page: var oDropdown = $("#element").msDropdown().data("dd");
[13:20:59] <RNT> peol, but what is data.("dd") ?
[13:21:17] <peol> .api wrap @ iaj
[13:21:17] <b-ot> iaj: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[13:22:01] <peol> RNT, .data() is a data store for the element, which the plugin you use stores their own API object, so you need to get that object to work with it
[13:23:16] <RNT> so, i have to use oDropdown = $("#element").msDropdown().data("dd"); instead oDropdown = $("#element").msDropdown(); in my page?
[13:23:27] <peol> exactly
[13:23:33] <RNT> i'll try
[13:23:46] <peol> and you shouldn't need to wrap it in try/catch
[13:26:08] <RNT> peol, won't work, now is not able to get the msDropdown object
[13:26:39] <peol> are you sure your selector is right? it looks odd. Is there an element with the class .selector?
[13:27:01] <RNT> here is the page:
[13:27:02] <RNT> http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[13:28:41] <peol> please use jsfiddle.net to show your problem, i won't debug your full webpage for you
[13:29:07] <RNT> i don't know how to use that jsfiddle
[13:29:40] <RNT> in fact, it ask me to put my whole page o it, but i have a extra work to split it in css, js, html, etc
[13:31:11] <peol> no, you just need to add the <select> element, the jquery plugin and choose "jquery" as library on jsfiddle ;)
[13:36:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/djyXw/2/  <--- i need to center items using jquery via css3 translations
[13:36:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> the items (cube1, cube2, etc) are going all over the place an i dont know why
[13:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> any ideas?
[13:40:50] <RNT> peol, i used what you said and now is working, but only for the first element from "selector" class
[13:41:28] <RNT> "listElement" i mean, not "selector"
[13:41:42] <peol> RNT, yes, .data() is for a specific element. You need to wrap that in .each(function() { var data = $(this).data("dd"); ‚Ä¶. });
[13:42:14] <peol> Or rather, var data = $.data(this, "dd")
[13:46:04] <RNT> peol, like this:
[13:46:06] <RNT> $('#list .selector').msDropDown().each(function() { var data = $.data(this, "dd"); });
[13:46:38] <peol> RNT, yea'
[13:46:48] <RNT> and put this code where?
[13:48:00] <RNT> after dropDown was initialized?
[13:48:08] <peol> where your current code is
[13:52:32] <RNT> either i placed it in a wrong position, either i made another mistake, because does not produce the effect
[13:54:49] <RNT> peol, can you check please?
[14:11:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> is anyone there to help me?

[14:34:44] <wer0ckz> Hi Guys. Help please.  How to go back to the first dialog? Please see my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/j7vrZ/1/ - i'm using apprise plugin: http://thrivingkings.com/read/Apprise-The-attractive-alert-alternative-for-jQuery
[14:36:14] <TheCowboy> wer0ckz, I'm not certain on what you want to do exactly?
[14:36:31] <wer0ckz> Hi Cowboy.
[14:36:59] <wer0ckz> If you'll click "click me" it will pop-up the 1st dialog box. then click ok for 2nd dialog box. how to insert a "back" link or button to go back to 1st dialog?
[14:39:00] <TheCowboy> why do you want that behavior exactly?
[14:40:48] <wer0ckz> it should be a troubleshooting steps dialog box. if a user wants to go back to the previous box.
[14:40:54] <wer0ckz> can u help?
[14:45:23] <TheCowboy> I probably wouldn't use this plugin for that purpose
[14:45:36] <shoky> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/j7vrZ/2/
[14:45:41] <TheCowboy> might have to dig into the plugin code more to figure it out, and that's not always fun
[14:46:07] <wer0ckz> TheCowboy: i cant find any plugin. any recommendation?
[14:46:08] <TheCowboy> nice
[14:46:34] <wer0ckz> thank you shoky
[14:47:19] <wer0ckz> so it's using  showDialogs();
[14:47:32] <wer0ckz> going back to the main function
[14:47:45] <shoky> loop de loop
[14:48:36] <wer0ckz> what if you got 3 dialog box
[14:48:45] <wer0ckz> you want from 3rd dialog going back to 2nd
[14:48:51] <shoky> you'll figure it out
[14:49:06] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/j7vrZ/3 // eh, shoky's is better but mine works as well lol
[14:49:14] <TheCowboy> wer0ckz, not sure as far as plugins, I'd just code it from scratch myself but I'd probably take a different approach
[14:49:22] <wer0ckz> how? if i'll use showsDialogs(); it will go back to the first dialog
[14:49:49] <shoky> if you stop asking and go try to do it and think about it, you'll figure it out
[14:51:28] <wer0ckz> im trying for days now
[14:51:51] <wer0ckz> what if those 2 buttons are in used. example button 1 "YES - button 2 "NO" - where can i put the back button?
[14:52:11] <wer0ckz> others advice to use a different plugin.
[14:52:11] <Z3R0> you can create ANY button you want...
[14:52:57] <wer0ckz> Z3R0: i can only see two buttons avaialable for the plugin. im sorry im still really new to jquery
[14:53:06] <wer0ckz> is it possible to add another one?
[14:53:17] <Z3R0> yea, nvm, apparently that's way that plugin works
[14:53:50] <Z3R0> although jquery ui dialog lets you use more ;)
[14:54:21] <wer0ckz> yeah i'll change plugin then
[14:54:24] <wer0ckz> thanks for your help
[15:09:17] <wer0ckz> Help please about UI Dialog. $( "#dialog" ).dialog(); <-- can i insert a specific content? not a selector? - example $( "THIS IS MY CONTENT" ).dialog();
[15:11:33] <Z3R0> $("<div>This is my content</div>").dialog() should work
[15:13:34] <wer0ckz> thank you
[15:17:15] <sunbeam> input:checked:is('visible')
[15:17:19] <sunbeam> any idea what is wrong with this?
[15:17:52] <wer0ckz> http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/j7vrZ/6/ -  can i replace the "x" to a back button?
[15:23:21] <shoky> wer0ckz: you can style it using CSS and change what it does using the 'close' event
[15:24:30] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/j7vrZ/7/ // remove it :)
[15:24:58] <Z3R0> actually shoky I tried the 'close' event, and that didn't trigger :(
[15:24:58] <shoky> dat too
[15:25:12] <sunbeam> input:checked:is('visible') - any idea whats wrong with this selector?
[15:25:28] <Z3R0> nvm I did that on buttons: not outside of buttons lol
[15:25:35] <shoky> ;p
[15:25:50] <shoky> sunbeam:  don't you mean :visible  ?
[15:26:19] <sunbeam> shoky: using it as a selector in jq
[15:26:25] <shoky> sunbeam: yes
[15:26:42] <shoky> `api :visible
[15:26:43] <b-ot> shoky: :visible Selector: Selects all elements that are visible. http://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[15:26:46] <sunbeam> input:checked:visible
[15:26:47] <sunbeam> like this?
[15:26:57] <shoky> better than what you had before..
[15:27:03] <shoky> `api :is
[15:27:03] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[15:27:14] <Z3R0> `api is
[15:27:15] <b-ot> Z3R0: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[15:27:29] <shoky> .is('visible') would be just as bad :P
[15:27:36] <sunbeam> thanks
[15:28:10] <RNT> can somebody help me with
[15:28:11] <RNT> http://jsfiddle.net/QLyZK/
[15:28:49] <Z3R0> can't really see muh rnt since all the images are gone
[15:29:08] <RNT> i know :(
[15:29:30] <RNT> see on the original how it looks like: http://rntplayer.com/test3.php
[15:30:20] <shoky> RNT: .data(...) returns data only for the first matched element
[15:30:34] <RNT> yes, i want to return for all
[15:31:15] <RNT> somebody told me to use something like $('#list .selector').msDropDown().each(function() { var data = $.data(this, "dd"); });
[15:31:39] <RNT> but i don't know if is really correct and where to put it
[15:32:31] <shoky> RNT: http://jsfiddle.net/QLyZK/2/
[15:33:57] <RNT> wow! shoky! thank you!
[15:33:59] <shoky> or if you might have more than one .selector per .listElement you can do:  $(this).find('.selector').each(function() { $(this).data('dd').close(); });
[15:34:03] <shoky> np
[15:43:00] <Balousen> Guys I need some help I have been fighting with this issue for several hours. My sliders are loading fine when I run the html file locally but as soon I upload it to a webserver it does not load the sliders... All references are linked to external sources on the web and as said it¬¥s working locally. Anyone who have a idea ? Thanks in advance
[15:44:36] <shoky> Balousen: got a link?
[15:47:27] <Balousen> shoky vikinktattoo.com/mobil/
[15:49:30] <shoky> Balousen: did you see the error?
[15:50:23] <Balousen> I dont get any system error but under the drop downs under tale data etc. it should show a slider
[15:51:05] <shoky> do you know know how to get to your browsers devtools js console?
[15:51:17] <shoky> you should always look there..
[15:52:13] <Balousen> shoky no I use google chrome any shortcut ?
[15:52:47] <shoky> ctrl-shift-j for the console.  f12 in for the devtools in general
[15:52:55] <shoky> `ftj @ Balousen
[15:53:07] <Balousen> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'slider'
[15:53:21] <shoky> Balousen: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:53:43] <shoky> Balousen: yeah, you're not including the slider plugin or smth
[15:54:30] <Balousen> I really dont understand because I dont use anything from local at all
[15:54:38] <Balousen> and thx for the link ! :)
[15:54:46] <shoky> you're not including it
[15:54:50] <shoky> at all
[15:55:19] <shoky> oh sorry
[15:55:30] <shoky> it's jquery ui slider?
[15:57:03] <Balousen> it¬¥s a jquery slider where u can change values on the slider like 1-2-3
[15:57:16] <Balousen> sorry for being a noob it¬¥s my first project with jquery
[15:59:06] <shoky> Balousen: you're including jquery twice
[15:59:24] <Balousen> I have tried removed 1 version etc. but still does not work
[15:59:37] <Balousen> and if I remove one of the versions it does not work local either
[15:59:50] <shoky> then you have to resolve that problem
[15:59:57] <shoky> it's a seperate issue
[16:00:50] <Balousen> shoky can u point me in the right direction ? http://jsfiddle.net/Pm59B/
[16:01:11] <shoky> remove the 2.0.0 include for now
[16:01:55] <shoky> or just.. remove it
[16:04:00] <Balousen> It works now !!! u are a f**** genious ! Thanks for taking time to answer my noob questions !
[16:04:14] <shoky> ;]
[16:04:50] * sportman waves, anyone here using flexslider?
[16:38:41] <Balousen> shoky now the noob is back ;) U have any advise how I can remove the dropdowns ? I have tried disable the options but it disables the sliders too
[16:49:08] <`e> hi, i've got a problem with jstree and json_data
[16:50:24] <`e> is there a way to get the "data" and "children" content of the array passed as result of the db query, using them as, for example, href element of each <li> ?
[17:02:51] <shoky> Balousen: i don't understand
[17:18:21] <`e> hi, i've got a problem with jstree and json_data
[17:18:24] <`e> is there a way to get the "data" and "children" content of the array passed as result of the db query, using them as, for example, href element of each <li> ?
[17:19:19] <Balousen> shoky I need to find a way so I dont have dropdown boxes over the slider www.mobilregning.dk PREFIX| spoke about I should use div instead of select but when I do that it disable the slider
[17:41:56] <`e> is there a way to set link to each <li> element create dinamically with json_data with jstree?
[17:53:13] <shoky> Balousen: if you dont want the dropdown there, don't put it there..
[19:33:29] <nesoi> if I want to put in some element for the sole purpose of containing some data, what's the lightest weight element to use? <div>?
[19:34:48] <Gazpacho> put it in from javascript code?
[19:35:18] <Gazpacho> no elements are specified to be "lightweight"
[19:35:51] <nesoi> I mean which has the least impact on jquery or the dom?
[19:36:21] <Gazpacho> you didn't answer the first question
[19:36:49] <nesoi> yes, from javascript
[19:37:21] <Gazpacho> I think if you don't want your data to affect the dom or jquery the way to do that would be to keep it in a variable, not in an element
[19:39:18] <nesoi> Gazpacho:  so what I'm trying to do is to use a jquery mobile plugin called simpledialog2, in which you define a function to be executed on button tap. I need to assign a value to a variable elsewhere when that happens, but I don't think I would have access to the value at that time, so I was thinking of storing it in the button's html and querying it that way
[19:41:10] <Gazpacho> i can't help you with that
[19:42:16] <boytoy_> Gazpacho: yes you can
[19:42:19] <boytoy_> you can do it
[19:42:29] <boytoy_> repeat after me "i'm a big boy"
[19:42:29] <nesoi> do you know if a callback like that would have access to globals in the rest of the code?
[19:42:35] <nesoi> I can test it easily enough I guess...
[19:42:53] <Gazpacho> nesoi: globals are always accessible by definition
[20:10:20] <nesoi> so I have an event . the target is an html element. how do I address stuff within that? I have e.target‚Ä¶ then if I want data-my-thing.value how do I get it?
[20:11:51] <nesoi> to be clearer, an event is executing a callback with the event as a parameter. I can see that event.target is probably the html I want. How do I get anything out of that?
[20:12:50] <Andrew_R> nesoi: you should use this or $(this)
[20:13:00] <Andrew_R> this will be the element that triggered the event
[20:13:46] <nesoi> ok so if I use $(this), then how would I access it?
[20:14:07] <nesoi> it's defined as function(e) so e should work too, no?
[20:14:38] <nesoi> elsewhere I have e.target.id and that works, but I need to access something else here
[20:15:24] <Andrew_R> what do you need to get?
[20:16:01] <nesoi> the target is a button with <div id=somevalue data-my-data="what I care about">
[20:16:10] <nesoi> that div is inside the button
[20:17:01] <Andrew_R> $(this).data('my-data')
[20:17:38] <nesoi> ok, thanks. when would you use $(this) and when e.?
[20:18:46] <Andrew_R> personally, I don't really use event.target at all, I am pretty sure that event.target == this
[20:19:25] <Andrew_R> there are other things that event is useful for though, like event.preventDefault() or event.stopPropagation()
[20:21:11] <nesoi> it didn't like that‚Ä¶ returns undefined
[20:21:56] <Andrew_R> nesoi: the target is a button with <div id=somevalue data-my-data="what I care about">
[20:21:56] <Andrew_R> nesoi: that div is inside the button
[20:22:02] <nesoi> how can I print out the entire html pointed to by $(this)?
[20:22:17] <Andrew_R> is the element you are trying to get the data from inside the "event" element?
[20:22:19] <nesoi> maybe it doesn't contain what I think it does
[20:22:28] <nesoi> it's inside the target
[20:22:33] <nesoi> event.target
[20:22:35] <nesoi> or should be
[20:23:11] <Andrew_R> so it may be $(this).find('#somevalue).data('my-data') then?
[20:23:42] <Andrew_R> this just points to an element in the DOM, so you would access any child elements the same way you would if it wasn't in an event handler
[20:25:25] <nesoi> I don't know the ID of the element though, and I can't know it. If I knew it, I wouldn't have to do this!
[20:25:54] <nesoi> so I need to get the data-my-data value that's in whatever div is in that target element
[20:26:22] <Andrew_R> $(this).find('div').data('my-data')
[20:27:00] <Andrew_R> read up on selectors and dom traversal in the documentation
[20:28:06] <nesoi> ah ok
[20:28:14] <nesoi> thanks
[20:29:27] <Andrew_R> :) np
[20:38:47] <nesoi> hm still not working‚Ä¶ returns null or undefined depending on how I do it
[20:39:38] <Andrew_R> nesoi: could you make a fiddle with just the parts you are working with?
[20:40:19] <nesoi> how can I display the entire contents of $(5his)?
[20:40:25] <nesoi> I can't. It's a phonegap app
[20:40:31] <nesoi> it doesn't work outside of a cell phone
[20:40:40] <Andrew_R> $(this).html()
[20:42:40] <nesoi> ah. $(this) is just a bunch of javascript code. no actual html of the target element which was tapped.
[20:43:34] <Andrew_R> I have never used phonegap, so I'm not sure if there are any differences
[20:43:47] <nesoi> shouldn't be
[20:44:23] <nesoi> so how do I access the html of the button that was tapped actually?
[20:44:32] <nesoi> since $(this).html doesn't have it
[20:46:06] <afrance> Try using attr and get the attribute.
[20:46:49] <nesoi> .attr of what?
[20:47:01] <Andrew_R> how do you create your button?
[20:47:33] <nesoi> it's created by this plugin simpledialog2, so I don't actually know how it's created unfortunately
[20:48:07] <afrance> what do you mean by the html of a button? The caption on it?
[20:48:15] <nesoi> yes
[20:48:23] <afrance> its caption is an attribute, use attr
[20:48:48] <nesoi> but I put a div in too which contains the data I want, although I could extract it from the button captoin
[20:49:22] <afrance> iirc: $(this).attr("value") will give you the caption...
[20:49:41] <Andrew_R> you will need to figure out the HTML it generates, a normal <button> can't have a div inside it
[20:49:44] <afrance> where this is the button
[20:49:59] <Andrew_R> here's an example of what we are talking about with plain html: http://jsfiddle.net/GDLa8/
[20:50:05] <nesoi> it's in a popup
[20:50:19] <afrance> or that if its not an input element...
[20:51:02] <nesoi> I don't see what to query in the attr() doc
[20:52:03] <afrance> the attribute with the caption, in a normal button the caption is defined by value, so you want to get the value attribute...
[20:52:07] <robert_> is there a responsive tab control that converts to an accordion that looks even remotely professional?
[20:52:24] <PREFIX|> Parker is one of the better/best jason statham movies ive seen
[20:52:26] <PREFIX|> very enjoyable
[20:53:00] <nesoi> so $(this).attr(value) ?
[20:53:41] <afrance> <afrance> iirc: $(this).attr("value") will give you the caption...
[20:55:43] <nesoi> undefined
[20:56:13] <TeddyMurray> hi im trying to create a chat script for my website but i do not want to have to use a timer because it seems inefficient
[20:56:15] <afrance> Then you need to figure out how your buttons are being made
[20:56:18] <TeddyMurray> is there some way to create a socket?
[20:56:26] <TeddyMurray> in the browser
[20:57:49] <Andrew_R> nesoi: we're kind just guessing here what your HTML structure looks like, there must be a way to figure it out even though it's a phonegap app
[20:58:21] <nesoi> yeah, how? :)
[20:58:51] <nesoi> the problem I'm trying to solve is that I create a callback function for each button, and I need to know which button was pressed.
[20:59:01] <nesoi> should be easy, but somehow I'm not getting it to work
[20:59:42] <nesoi> is there a way to put some static value in each function that says what button it is? I don't think so‚Ä¶ the buttons/functions are created in a loop
[21:01:27] <Gazpacho> teddymurray: no
[21:01:37] <TeddyMurray> yes there is
[21:02:33] <Gazpacho> why the fuck did you ask the question then
[21:02:39] <Gazpacho> smarty guy
[21:02:46] <TeddyMurray> i asked and then researched and then you answered me incorrectly
[21:03:20] <Gazpacho> and what did you find
[21:03:37] <Andrew_R> nesoi: is this what you are using? http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-SimpleDialog/demos2/
[21:04:05] <nesoi> yes‚Ä¶ I'm just looking at it and it seems to have settable values that could be queried
[21:04:16] <TeddyMurray> nodejs
[21:04:34] <Gazpacho> teddymurray: ha
[21:04:40] <TeddyMurray> http://html5demos.com/web-socket#view-source and htis
[21:04:44] <TeddyMurray> this*
[21:05:00] <nesoi> hmm
[21:05:12] <Gazpacho> websockets are not real sockets
[21:05:23] <Gazpacho> if you have to make a TCP socket connection, they won't do it
[21:05:53] <nesoi> or maybe not
[21:09:19] <Andrew_R> nesoi: I think you're on the right track to try to use the stuff that is built into your plugin, but without seeing more of your code, I'm not sure exactly what it should be
[21:12:21] <nesoi> it says thisInput contains the value of the buttonInput field, but this.thisInput is undefined and so is $(this).thisinput
[21:12:26] <nesoi> any idea how I would access it?
[21:15:12] <wilkinsmc> I hope i can figure out why my website doesn't work properly in firefox and IE, only chrome
[21:15:19] <wilkinsmc> the rotate plugin simply won't work in firefox
[21:16:46] <wilkinsmc> i heard you can get around activex authorization tho
[21:16:52] <wilkinsmc> so maybe there's hope for IE
[21:18:06] <crankharder> does the currently dragged LI in a sortable list get a new class added to it - how can i figure out what that is?
[21:19:10] <Gazpacho> look at it in the debugger as you're dragging it
[21:20:16] <nesoi> oh well‚Ä¶ I'll look at it more later...
[21:20:22] <nesoi> thanks for the help!
[21:35:25] <wilkinsmc> internet explorer has promoted much lost free time :P
[21:41:44] <wilkinsmc> for some reason you can't flip an image horizontally in IE and have it maintain opacity
[21:41:53] <wilkinsmc> even if it was opaque to begin with
[21:42:06] <wilkinsmc> i mean set in the image
[22:01:31] <madprops> I have an interesting situation. I have a div that has resizable and draggable and it acts jittery/buggy until I resize it
[22:01:43] <madprops> when I resize it to any size it continues to work just fine
[22:02:00] <madprops> so i'm trying to see what is causing it to fix it manually from the start
[22:02:14] <madprops> i tried trigger('resize') and changing the css for width and height but it didn't work
[22:38:33] <aaas> anyone see mobile web implementions of a treeview similar to this: http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.8/dojox/mobile/TreeView.html
[22:39:02] <aaas> wondering what the best starting palce would be or if it's been done befroe

[22:51:56] <wer0ckz> Hi. help please. my 2nd title for my 2nd dialog box is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/FrDhV/
[22:54:01] <runvnc> wer0ckz, why dont you just do the 2nd title the same way you did the first
[22:54:35] <runvnc> by changing the title attribute
[22:59:45] <wer0ckz> runvnc: i did. var title = "This is my title 2st"; // THIS IS NOT WORKING
[22:59:51] <wer0ckz> but it's not changing
[23:00:18] <runvnc> $('#dialog').attr('title', title)
[23:01:25] <wer0ckz> i tried that. same thing. please see http://jsfiddle.net/jmcausing/FrDhV/1/
[23:01:28] <wer0ckz> thank you for helping
[23:07:30] <Gazpacho> wer0ckz: http://jsfiddle.net/BPXW7/1/
[23:08:08] <Gazpacho> I'm thinking that the first time your dialog is shown, the title attribute is copied to the dialog's internal data. From then on the internal data determines the title and the attribute does not. this is a guess
[23:08:44] <Gazpacho> let me clean that up
[23:09:22] <Gazpacho> aw I gav eyou the wrong link, hold on

[23:17:28] <wilkinsmc> anyone ever try to rotate something in firefox and have it fug up?
[23:17:32] <wilkinsmc> with the jquery rotate plugin
[23:18:31] <wer0ckz> thank you so much Gazpacho
[23:33:21] <alizadeh> hi
[23:33:34] <wer0ckz> Gazpacho: is it possible to go back to previous dialog with out calling the function?
[23:33:38] <alizadeh> how to set jqueryui datepicker on live elements?
[23:34:33] <Gazpacho> wer0ckz: you only using one dialog. there's no other dialog to go back to
[23:34:41] <wer0ckz> yes
[23:34:50] <wer0ckz> i am planning to create like 50 dialog
[23:35:00] <wer0ckz> its like a troubleshooting steps YES NO BACK
[23:35:04] <wer0ckz> something like a guide or a flow
[23:35:08] <wer0ckz> is that possible?
[23:35:09] <Gazpacho> then you probably want more than one dialog element
[23:35:17] <wer0ckz> oh
