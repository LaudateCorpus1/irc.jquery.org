[01:38:58] <shoky_> yolan: el1.add(el2).on('change'
[01:39:11] <shoky_> assuming those are jquery objects
[01:39:21] <yolan> shoky_, thanks, I figured it out in the end :p
[01:39:42] <yolan> and I used exactly this :)

[09:10:59] <forgotmynick> how do i get the response of another form that's submitted through ajax?
[09:14:03] <Forever80> Bonjour tout le monde / Hello everybody
[09:17:22] <Forever80> I have a component (signaturePad) which is instantiated by $('.classname').signaturePad ... I try to join it to another place of the script via its id (by one each) $('#' + $(item).prop("id")).fromData but I have an error the SignaturePad component does not seem to be reachable this way, would someone have an experience to share? please
[09:28:34] <thykka> forgotmynick, what exactly do you mean by 'another' form?
[09:29:22] <thykka> Forever80, .fromData, or .formData?
[09:29:49] <Forever80> .fromData
[09:30:28] <thykka> Forever80, jQuery doesn't have that
[09:30:29] <Forever80> Ref gitHub is https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad
[09:30:54] <Forever80> hmm.. oh... yes
[09:31:39] <Forever80> Is there a possibility to reach the created object?
[09:31:57] <Forever80> Created by : $('.sigPad').signaturePad()
[09:32:40] <Forever80> and .sigPad this <div class="sigPad" id="id_sigpad_1">
[09:33:39] <thykka> you could assign it to a variable
[09:34:04] <thykka> const mySignaturePad = $('.sigPad').signaturePad()
[09:34:25] <Forever80> Thanks

[09:37:27] <forgotmynick> thykka: there is a mailchimp form which submits by ajax and returns a result. i would like to create a function that also retrieves the results so i can perform other actions. does that make sense?
[09:37:48] <thykka> forgotmynick, yes, that would be the ajax callback function
[09:38:13] <forgotmynick> thykka: that would require modifying the mailchimp form script right?
[09:38:45] <thykka> i guess? it depends on how the form was implemented
[09:39:08] <thykka> or whether mailchimp provides hooks for this
[09:42:38] <forgotmynick> there are no hooks and i can't really do callbacks since the script is loaded from their domain. i can of course self host the script but that's not what i'm looking for. i really just want to know if it's possible to hook into the existing hooks and somehow get the data. i suppose i can use ajaxsetup
[09:46:17] <thykka> seems like they provide a lot of things https://developer.mailchimp.com/documentation/mailchimp/guides/get-started-with-mailchimp-api-3/
[09:46:26] <thykka> but of course I know nothing about your setup, so
[09:46:28] <thykka> Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[09:54:20] <Forever80> thykka: is "const myvar = new SignaturePad(document.getElementById('my-id-pad'))" identical to const myvar = $('#my-id-pad').signaturePad()" ?
[09:57:09] <thykka> TIAS?
[16:31:30] <winircuser-831> with .droppable I am creating a new droppable when the clone is dropped. I am trying to set the css for it. It works fine with .css ({}) structure.  I just can't figure out how to set elements such h2 display: 'none',
