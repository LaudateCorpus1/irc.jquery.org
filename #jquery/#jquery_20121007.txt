[00:07:42] <buu> Anyone mind recommending a good chart library for jquery that does line, bar and pie charts?
[00:12:19] <angelazou> buu: jqplot
[00:13:51] <buu> angelazou: Thanks
[01:21:49] <angelazou> I need a little help writing a particular part of the snippet
[01:22:04] <angelazou> I have the entire script available here http://jsbin.com/ixihej/1/edit
[01:22:57] <angelazou> basically I have a paragraph containing a placeholder that I wish to be replaced with a text block
[01:23:09] <angelazou> I also posted this on stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12767193/replace-placeholder-in-paragraph-with-text-block-jquery
[01:23:37] <angelazou> in the thread, you can see what exactly I would like to achieve
[01:24:11] <angelazou> I'm having problem writing it because I'm not sure how can I break the paragraph into 2
[01:24:18] <angelazou> and insert the text block
[01:24:27] <angelazou> at the same time, maintain the styling consistent
[01:49:39] <chovy> does jquery not have any cookie functions?
[02:19:04] <derPepo> @chovy there are some plugins
[03:10:54] <ralf_> how can i enforce that a GET request is closed? i tried to set the connection:close header with not result
[03:13:45] <Iszak> ralf_ set a timeout?
[03:20:39] <ralf_> Iszak: hmhm, if i set timeout to 1 then the request gets no response, iam firing a new request after the previous one is done, depending on the client connection i cant know how long this may take.
[03:21:05] <Iszak> ralf_ so basically you're saying the server is holding on the connection and not closing it?
[03:21:07] <Iszak> is that your problem?
[03:21:53] <ralf_> Iszak: yes, its "keep-alive".. and i want the connection to be closed after its done.
[03:22:27] <Iszak> hm not sure how you (the client) will know unless you've got a on-data event
[03:25:56] <ralf_> Iszak: "on-data" event? i set some handler, success/complete and so on
[03:26:13] <ralf_> Iszak: but i cant find a function like "close()" or so
[03:26:26] <Iszak> ralf_ yes I don't think it exists, there's progress event (XHRv2) but success and complete won't end if the server is holding onto the request, surely?
[03:26:32] <Iszak> unless I'm misunderstanding things.
[03:27:45] <ralf_> Iszak: yes. and as i tried to add the "connection:close" header its getting ignored..
[03:28:12] <ralf_> (adding headers in gerneral works for me as i add other headers)
[03:29:35] <Iszak> ralf_ I'm not sure you can do it. connection close appears to be something the server should reply with, not be part of the request.
[03:30:04] <ralf_> Iszak: if the client sends "close" the server will close the connection
[03:30:22] <ralf_> Iszak: i can disable "keepalive" on server side but its a general setting and thats bad :(
[03:30:39] <Iszak> ralf_ hang on, are you saying, on the server side you're sending connection close?
[03:30:47] <Iszak> or on the client side, you're making a request with connection close?
[03:30:54] <ralf_> second one
[03:31:09] <Iszak> that won't work, the connection close is something on the server side afaik, at least from what I looked at.
[03:31:13] <ralf_> client->"close" .. but ajax or something ignorres/removes the header
[03:31:21] <Iszak> http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html 14.10 Connection, HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example,
[03:31:35] <Iszak> see specifically the term "sender" which is the web server
[03:31:50] <Iszak> oh nvm should have read more.
[03:32:01] <Iszak> maybe it's your web server or application layer that's ignoring it?
[03:32:28] <ralf_> $ echo -ne "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\nHost: dont.know\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n" | nc localhost 80
[03:32:35] <ralf_> vs.
[03:32:35] <ralf_> $ echo -ne "HEAD / HTTP/1.1\nHost: dont.know\nConnection: close\n\n" | nc localhost 80
[03:32:57] <Iszak> what, this is not jquery!
[03:33:00] <ralf_> i tried the last one with ajax (adding the connection close header -> ajax did not send that header)
[03:33:17] <Iszak> ralf_ OH so you're trying to set it, but your code is not setting the header, what's your code?
[03:33:21] <ralf_> Iszak: no, its a test what keepalive and close do from client side ;)
[03:34:01] <ralf_> pasting 4 lines ok?
[03:34:05] <Iszak> no :P
[03:34:09] <Iszak> ?pastebin
[03:34:10] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:34:52] <ralf_> Iszak: http://cxg.de/_f1bcec.htm
[03:35:01] <ralf_> Iszak: the byte range header is added
[03:35:21] <Iszak> ?source
[03:35:22] <bot-t> jQuery 1.5 - http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5/jquery.js
[03:35:36] <Iszak> ralf_ what version?
[03:35:41] <Iszak> (this is for me)
[03:36:12] <ralf_> 1.8.1
[03:37:24] <Iszak> ralf_ hmm nothing that should override it.
[03:37:37] <pangelovski> hi guys, i have a field set containing radio buttons, and the theming is good in a regular browser, but when i browse the page in iOS simulator, the radio button theme is not applied
[03:37:47] <ralf_> Iszak: maybe its the browser
[03:37:48] <pangelovski> anyone else experienced the same thing?
[03:38:06] <Iszak> pangelovski this is standard.
[03:38:19] <pangelovski> so there is not way around this?
[03:38:21] <Iszak> It's also not a jQuery question, more of a CSS question.
[03:38:35] <Iszak> The only way around it is to create a "faux" or "fake" radio button, which requires javascript.
[03:39:01] <Iszak> ralf_ perhaps, I mean are you testing it in GC?
[03:40:30] <pangelovski> Iszak: so how is it that the css is not applied to radio buttons and drop down menus in iOS?
[03:41:00] <Iszak> pangelovski hang on, just so i'm clear, this is just raw html elements, right?
[03:41:12] <ralf_> Iszak: what is "GC"? garbage collector? ;)
[03:41:21] <Iszak> google chrome :P
[03:41:26] <ralf_> Iszak: (iam new to that jquery stuff ;))
[03:41:32] <ralf_> Iszak: firefox
[03:41:49] <pangelovski> i have a local php website with html content. i do an ajax get and load the content into a div.
[03:41:51] <Iszak> try it in another browsers, see if you can reproduce, but it sounds to be honest, that it's not sending the header.
[03:42:01] <pangelovski> Iszak: http://pangelovski.mine.nu/phonegap/fastigheter/www/apartment_new.html
[03:42:17] <ralf_> Iszak: ok, thanks so far
[03:42:41] <Iszak> pangelovski ah I see what you mean, I have no idea, you'd need to use a debug software. This is jQuery Mobile? Try #jquerymobile.
[03:42:53] <Iszak> debug software = weirne/debug.phonegap.com (no phonegap required)
[04:00:10] <radiantstatic> Is there a reasonable way to use the class/id value of 'this' to manipulate a class with a similar name? For example, if 'this' class = social and I want to manipulate the 'social-action' class, is there a way I could do something like 'this-action' and have it produce the same results. Sorry this is a very poorly phrased question.
[04:01:24] <radiantstatic> I have an example - http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/Apmq4/2/
[04:01:49] <radiantstatic> Currently the social media names fade in and raise above the designated li.
[04:03:16] <jotham> can you 'toggle' the hover state of something at all? or should i just listen to the over/out event and make the hover style another class?
[04:03:23] <jotham> (sometimes i want things to stay hovered)
[04:07:52] <derPepo> radiantstatic: $( $(this).attr("id") + "-action" ) will works
[04:09:09] <radiantstatic> derPepo: Thank you very much. Exactly what I needed :-)
[04:09:18] <derPepo> \o/
[04:09:38] <dabear> lol
[04:09:53] <dabear> constructing a new object, just to get it's id attribute
[04:10:15] <derPepo> tell us the better solution
[04:10:16] <dabear> this.id would be shorter, faster, better
[04:10:56] <derPepo> radiantstatic: please us $( this.id + "-action")
[04:11:05] <derPepo> thank you @dabear
[04:11:24] <radiantstatic> dabear: Thanks.
[04:11:29] <radiantstatic> derPepo: Thank you again.
[04:25:00] <Pinchiukas> How can I get the mouse position relative to a div?
[04:25:12] <Pinchiukas> I mean, the mouse position in the div, not in the document.
[04:26:19] <derPepo> @Pinchiukas you get the position of the div with the offset function
[04:26:55] <Pinchiukas> derPepo: the div position in the document and then subtract that from the mouse position?
[04:27:10] <qvarkk> what am I doing wrong with the carousel on http://www3.testwebb.nu? I'm following the touchcarousel, http://www3.testwebb.nu/touchcarousel-1
[04:27:59] <derPepo> Pinchuk: maybe that is the right way. I don't understand your problem fully.
[05:29:32] <HardFu_> hey, is there a plugin that turns input of comma separated values into tag bubbles?
[05:32:28] <HardFu_> nvm, found it
[05:37:49] <pangelovski> hi guys, it might be a stupid question, but how can i add js variables as part of html. example i want to add something like this <div id="test_<js var>" class="example">
[05:42:51] <HardFu_> pangelovski: put it in a rel="" attribute
[05:43:17] <pangelovski> HardFu_: what do you mean?
[05:43:18] <Rudeboy> Is there a way to have to speeds of .toggle?
[05:43:33] <HardFu_> pangelovski: why do you need the var as part of id
[05:45:05] <pangelovski> HardFu: Im loading a html file based on a button click. the html file consist a div segment containing some content. Since the user can create multiple segments, i need to add a number to the id so i can identify which segment was clicked in a later stage
[05:45:29] <Rudeboy> Is there a way to have to speeds of .toggle?
[05:45:44] <Rudeboy> Like one speed to show, one speed to hide an element
[05:46:19] <geekbuntu> Rudeboy, try inserting the milisecond speed in each toggle()
[05:46:43] * geekbuntu Rudeboy: .toggle(400)
[05:49:05] <sonotos> pangelovski: i normaly use json strings in var tags to embed variables in markup
[05:49:19] <Rudeboy> geekbuntu: I've got a fadeToggle, with only place for one speed
[05:49:28] <pangelovski> sonotos: any example you can show?
[05:49:43] <sonotos> second
[05:49:47] <Rudeboy> geekbuntu: so like 400 in-out. How can I get 400 in, 800 out?
[05:50:24] <geekbuntu> Rudeboy, you would probably have to control each event show(400) - hide(800)
[05:51:36] <Rudeboy> geekbuntu: This is what the snippet looks like: http://pastebin.com/uv4i8ErY
[05:54:04] <sonotos> pangelovski: http://pastebin.com/LwfJeyq4 like that
[05:54:26] <geekbuntu> Rudeboy, i'm on my android - so, can't test it, but maybe extending the base function would work
[05:55:01] <sonotos> pangelovski: reading looks like http://pastebin.com/QT3D48U9
[05:55:04] <Rudeboy> geekbuntu: ok no worries, I'll just play around with it and see what I can come up with. Thanks though :)
[05:55:15] <geekbuntu> Rudeboy, function() { DOM.toggle().toggleFadeIn(400).toggleFadeOut(800)
[05:55:25] <geekbuntu> Rudeboy, damn that's hard to type on a xoom
[05:55:36] <Logikos> can someone please tell me in this case why $().trigger('click') does ont apear to be working please? http://jsfiddle.net/qhkYT/
[05:55:41] * geekbuntu but i can't test it for you
[05:56:52] <sonotos> pangelovski: you need to hide var via css display:none normaly var tags are shown, think it sould also be possible to pack the content in script tags
[05:57:22] <geekbuntu> Logikos, um, it works for me
[05:57:29] <geekbuntu> in chrome anyways
[05:57:40] <Logikos> strange... i'm in firefox, i'll try chrome
[05:57:46] <sonotos> many libraries also just define custom attributes for single variables
[05:57:55] <Logikos> i also tried $().click() .. and it shows in the log but it does nothing
[05:57:58] <Rudeboy> geekbuntu: Thanks so much:)
[05:58:02] <pangelovski> sonotos: http://pastebin.com/BgR3jJ2B this is the file I'm loading
[05:58:41] <sonotos> are "-" alowed in attribute names?
[05:58:45] <pangelovski> sonotos: at line 10, i ant to add the var numAartments
[05:59:05] <pangelovski> *want*
[05:59:08] <geekbuntu> sonotos, don't be afraid to try it ;-)
[05:59:16] <geekbuntu> pretty sure browser will not blow up
[05:59:26] * geekbuntu no guarantee tho
[05:59:27] <Logikos> geekbuntu: i've tryed in firefox now, and chrome also, it shows click and close in console as it should, but nothing happens
[05:59:56] <Logikos> obviously the lightbox wont work in jsfiddle as its not loaded, but it should click the link and take you there in the test?
[06:00:25] <Logikos> it makes no sence that it work work for you and not for me...
[06:00:39] <sonotos> geekbuntu: there's a little diffrence between standard and working anyhow
[06:00:47] <geekbuntu> Logikos, my chrome was personally blessed by pope irish tho
[06:01:12] <Logikos> oh ... well then :P
[06:01:13] <sonotos> i personally don't really care about html to much as long i'ts valid xml
[06:02:21] <geekbuntu> Logikos going to setup to edge/try firebug
[06:03:37] <geekbuntu> Logikos, are you 'sure' this is correct?: Shadowbox.close();
[06:04:27] <iNerd> Ahoy.
[06:04:48] <geekbuntu> Logikos, before you go nuts - you called it correctly
[06:04:52] <geekbuntu> someone else had the problem
[06:04:53] <geekbuntu> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7448800/close-shadowbox-from-inside-iframe-using-2-methods
[06:04:55] <Logikos> geekbuntu: rith this second, no, but that part doesnt mater if i cant get the click to work, that is just code to close the shadowbox after it is opened
[06:05:00] <geekbuntu> has to be closed with a different bind
[06:05:20] <Logikos> i cant troubleshoot the close, if i cant get it to open
[06:05:21] <Logikos> lol
[06:05:29] * geekbuntu kudos to google
[06:05:49] <Logikos> .trigger('click'); for me apears to do nothing
[06:06:00] <geekbuntu> can't bind event from event
[06:06:07] <Logikos> i'll remove the shadowbox close
[06:06:20] <geekbuntu> dom.on('event','what-to-bind-',function() do something
[06:06:32] <iNerd> question. I'm trying to just add the property 'resize' to a tag. not sure quite what to use to do it.
[06:07:03] <Logikos> geekbuntu: are you still refering to the shadowbox close? or the click?
[06:07:14] <geekbuntu> Logikos, just to your last typed line
[06:07:26] <geekbuntu> .trigger('click
[06:07:29] <iNerd> .setAttribute() wants two arguments
[06:07:30] <geekbuntu> is not correct
[06:09:14] <Logikos> geekbuntu: ty, out of time now, i've saved the link and will read up on it
[06:09:23] <geekbuntu> Logikos, cool/& gl
[06:24:20] <pangelovski> hi guys, i have a id="example_somthing_var" is it possible to replace the "something" part with another value?
[06:29:23] <ukukuk> yes of course
[06:33:24] <pangelovski> hi guys, i have a id="example_somthing_var" is it possible to replace the "something" part with another value?
[06:33:41] <derPepo> there is a replace method in javascript, very easy
[06:33:52] <derPepo> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp
[06:34:15] <derPepo> do you understand it?
[06:34:16] <pangelovski> ah, thanks derpepo
[06:39:47] <pangelovski> derPepo: did not work
[06:41:15] <chrisbuchholz> Say i have this markup: <div><h1>something></h1><div id="content">fkjksldfjdfkjskldfjj</div></div> and #content is display:none. Then i want to animate the size change of the outer div when i set the h1 to display:none and the inner-div to display:block. How would i do that?
[06:41:40] <chrisbuchholz> And the outer div doesnt have a size set. It just fills what it must.
[06:42:02] <ukukuk> chrisbuchholz width: 100%
[06:42:19] <chrisbuchholz> ukukuk: can you elaborate?
[06:42:50] <ukukuk> chrisbuchholz if you want that the outer div fills out the screen you have to set "width: 100%"
[06:43:26] <chrisbuchholz> ukukuk: Thats not what i want though. I want it to fill whatever its content takes up of space, and i want to animate the size change
[06:43:42] <chrisbuchholz> ..if i hide the h1 and display the content
[06:44:08] <chrisbuchholz> then the outer div will expand, and i want the expansion to animate
[06:44:43] <ukukuk> chrisbuchholz oh okay.. yes you can use the animate() function of jquery.
[06:45:11] <ukukuk> chrisbuchholz you only have to read out the width() of the inner div and set the new width of the outer div with the animate() function to the width of the inner div
[06:45:33] <chrisbuchholz> ukukuk: but how? If i do something like $('h1').hide() and $('#content').show('scale', {}, 1000); #content will animate but the outer div will just "pop"
[06:46:13] <ukukuk> okay. you should fixing the outer div's width and set overflow: hidden;
[06:46:22] <chrisbuchholz> ukukuk: will try
[06:46:39] <ukukuk> chrisbuchholz afterwards the outer div should not POP
[07:03:34] <anno1879> hello everybody, someone here who could help me with a small problem on using flexslide ?
[07:07:47] <anno1879> the problem is that the right navigation is showed at the false place and the caption is too big: http://s14.directupload.net/images/121007/7xfd8wow.jpg
[07:09:15] <anno1879> I'm using dreamweaver cs6 and added the flexslider via adobe widget manager, afterwoods i've changed the pictures in dreamweaver. All that worked perfectly, but the caption has still the size of the sample images
[07:09:34] <anno1879> where can i change the size of it? I've already searched in the code, but I didn't found it
[07:11:49] <CodesStuff> anno1879: .css()
[07:12:09] <CodesStuff> On a serious note, NEVER use Dreamweaver.
[07:12:33] <CodesStuff> Those Code-For-You applications are crutches and turn you into a bad developer.
[07:12:58] <scar> CodesStuff: i use DW code editor only. lol
[07:13:09] <scar> customized it to have everything else removed haha.
[07:13:22] <scar> not sure about its jquery syntax checker tho
[07:13:27] <CodesStuff> Still too many resources are being used for just an editor :P
[07:13:35] <CodesStuff> Sublime/Notepad++/gVim > DQW
[07:13:37] <CodesStuff> DW*
[07:14:37] <anno1879> codeStuff bla bla bla
[07:15:00] <anno1879> dw is great for doing the simple and basic stuff
[07:18:49] <CodesStuff> anno1879: Eh, fine. Don't take solid advice.
[07:19:33] <anno1879> I did not asked for an advice, I've asked for help where to change the size that's all....
[07:27:30] <anno1879> finally I've found it

[09:49:44] <walidvb> Hi guys! I need  to optimize the following site: www.vbbros.net/dietz/works/project , would anyone have any suggestion? I have 6*10 full window's size images to load at once, and i'm not sure what the best way to make it seem fast is...
[09:50:31] <walidvb> i'm using nested malson's cycle2, and i'mthinking of implementing this: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/progressive.php
[09:50:53] <walidvb> but it's quite complicated on drupal, so I wanted to have your opinion first?
[10:00:18] <aextetic> Yes; those girls by their teasing antics had left setient facing the challenge of a cockhead that was at least half an inch longer and a whole hell of a lot bulkier than it would have been ten minutes ago, when he was just ready to push in. But setient still wanted to proceed. Crazy girl, but who was he to dissuade her? At last Junior scented his long-denied prey and his whole length quivered and shook in his impatience. ...
[10:00:24] <aextetic> ... But how to do it? No more messing about; slow and steady and unrelenting would be best.
[10:00:27] <aextetic> He told both of the others to help make up for their teasing by holding his cock steady, and helping to prise her lips apart to receive him. Then he pressed the button as gently as possible, and maintained a steady pressure. The great pillar rose up until its tip was once again strenuously parting her lips. He kept going, ignoring setient's sharp intake of breath as the steadily increasing girth forced her ever wider. ...
[10:00:33] <aextetic> ... Eventually he was back at the point where Junior's conquest had been so rudely interrupted, and only the grossly distended coronal ridge remained outside. At that point he knew it was far better not to hesitate but to get the pain over with as soon as possible, and he carefully pressed a little harder. Junior shot upwards another inch very suddenly, and openfly cried out at the impossibly tight strangling squeeze on ...
[10:00:39] <aextetic> ... his flesh. Fuck that was a squeeze, like a tourniquet was tied round him and pulled suddenly shut. His startled cry was drowned by the scream that erupted from setient. But like any other over endowed man openfly had to steel himself against that, and soon another push on the button pushed Junior safely through the constriction.
[10:00:44] <aextetic> He was in! Boy, she was tight. But as her cries of shock gradually died away Junior was on fire with joy. He might still feel almost choked to death, but he'd soon be exercising his strength and making himself enough room. Boy he loved that moment of first getting his head in; that feeling of yet another tight cunt to loosen, to widen, to deepen, to mould to himself, to leave his unique mark on for life! To stretch her out ...
[10:00:50] <aextetic> ... like no other cock ever could! To go places in her body that no one else could ever reach! openfly cemented Junior's victory by sending him in another inch or two. Junior fired a second hefty fusillade just for the joy of it.
[10:00:52] <ryanneufeld> gah some one get OP
[10:00:54] <aextetic> But it wasn't until openfly could feel setient just beginning to relax a little around him, and until his sheer stretching size had forced a series of convulsive cums from setient, and until he'd matched her last one with a third mighty one of his own, that openfly was ready to lower himself very slowly and steadily out of her. He urged her to brace her legs firmly on the floor to stop Junior's flange pulling her down. ...
[10:00:58] <ryanneufeld> and ban this guy
[10:00:59] <jedimind> holy fuck
[10:01:00] <aextetic> ... Junior pulled free with a loud wet fart, and the cum poured out of her abused cunt behind him.
[10:01:03] <aextetic> She limped away, and looked ready for a rest or at least a soak in the tub. But openfly had other ideas. 'Stay there, setient. Please.'
[10:01:06] <aextetic> He spoke to jake, putting on a much sterner voice that his mood actually merited. It was amazing how much better a man felt once he'd come a few times. But she's played with him, now he would play with her.
[10:01:10] <aextetic> 'OK, jake, your turn now. Come and put your feet in these stirrups.' She meekly obeyed. 'Now setient, here are the controls. Take them. Punish her! Any way you want.'
[10:01:13] <aextetic> Junior reared up more menacing than ever, impatiently awaiting his revenge.
[10:01:15] <aextetic> wsargent seemed to be so mesmerised by the potential dangers of the fuck that was about to begin that she was forgetting the basics. openfly had to remind her that Junior needed lubing up again, and that he was very thirsty; so she quickly fetched new supplies from the cupboard and from the fridge, put the cans of drink beside him, and got to work. When she'd smothered his angry head in it, she liberally covered Junior's ...
[10:01:21] <aextetic> ... upper shaft in lube right down to jake's green line six inches lower down, and then another couple of inches lower down for a safety margin. The cans of his mineral drink began to have their effect; all three girls could hear the noises from openfly's groin which confirmed that his massive system was working at full power. But when openfly saw that wsargent had stopped lubing just two or three inches below the green ...
[10:01:27] <aextetic> ... marker he ground his ass angrily into the seat: 'Why stop there? I thought you girls were serious size queens. Maybe I was wrong. Junior underlined his rebuke by throbbing in frustration, and the great churning balls were shaking with anger.
[10:01:32] <aextetic> As wsargent obediently lathered up another tranche of the great pillar, and openfly looked on complacently as she worked, and while he drank, setient looked on. Her body was still numb from the brutal invasion she had endured. But she gazed at the cause of it, fascinated. She found this display of arrogance from openfly all the more enthralling because it came from a man who was normally so modest, reticent and cautious. ...
[10:01:37] <aextetic> ... Now at last he was asserting the power of his magnificent genitals. As she surveyed his enormous balls which were sagging way over the front of the seat, and which were forcing openfly to part his hefty thighs as wide as he could, and then let her eye travel slowly up the length of the collossal penis as wsargent continued to work on just a small section of it, setient was overwhelmed all over again. A man equipped ...
[10:01:43] <aextetic> ... like that needed to be arrogant, had every right to demand respect and willing obedience.
[10:01:47] <aextetic> But now all this power had been put at her disposal. How to use it? How to punish jake for the frustration and discomfort she had caused openfly and setient herself, but more especially for the disrespect she had shown Junior? openfly had left it entirely up to her. Supposing she teased jake, and kept feeding her short lengths of the mighty beast, pulling him out after three or four inches each time so that she didn't even ...
[10:01:52] <aextetic> ... get his whole head inside her? That would drive her wild and she'd be screaming out her frustration in minutes. Twenty minutes of that would be torture for any woman who longed for deep satisfaction. The trouble was, it would inflict equal punishment on Junior, and that was no part of her purpose. He'd had enough of that already. Or supposing she pushed the right hand button hard enough and long enough to shove the ...
[10:02:01] <aextetic> ... great head in very quickly: enough to make her squeal; but then immediately pushed the other one and pulled him right out again? That would inflict a huge shock to any girl's pussy and jake would be pleading for mercy; it would almost certainly make Junior swell up and inflict the maximum penalty. But it would cause him pain, no doubt about that, even if in the end he simply pulled jake down with him.
[10:02:06] <aextetic> Or what about going for gold, or, as she looked at Junior's many coloured markings, at least amber, or even red? Supposing she pressed that button hard and kept it pressed, and sent sixteen inches of Junior crashing up into her defenceless cunt? Or even more? That would indeed be 'punishment'. But of course this was fantasy and she knew that physical damage was no part of openfly's plan - nor was it of hers. She wasn't in ...
[10:02:11] <aextetic> ... reality at all angry with jake for playing a game with her and openfly, but she did think that she needed to be taught a lesson for disrespecting Junior. So no reason to let jake know that there was no real danger. She should be made to sweat a bit.
[10:02:15] <aextetic> At last wsargent put down the lube and, as openfly emptied a final can, she carefully grasped Junior by the neck and held him in place. setient put her finger on the button and smiled.
[10:02:24] <ryanneufeld> Thanks gnarf
[10:03:17] <amaroks> Hello Guys, I'm using .focus(function(){  do things })
[10:03:35] <amaroks> but that is triggered only when you use mouse cursor and when suing tab to get to field it doesnt work
[10:03:37] <amaroks> any solution?
[10:04:03] <gnarf> amaroks: shouldn't be the case... focus should definitely catch a tab - and it does
[10:04:07] <ryanneufeld> amaroks: focus is typically used for focusing on form elements
[10:04:09] <walidvb> Hi guys! I need  to optimize the following site: www.vbbros.net/dietz/works/project , would anyone have any suggestion? I have 6*10 full window's size images to load at once, and i'm not sure what the best way to make it seem fast is...
[10:04:13] <walidvb> i'm using nested malson's cycle2, and i'mthinking of implementing this: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/progressive.php
[10:04:18] <ryanneufeld> oh, I missread
[10:04:26] <walidvb> i need to implement that from within a views template, as in, write the first image in plain, and the following imgs within <script/>. they need to be properly JSON formed, but my problem is i need to encode full nodes, so i don't know how to handle the double-quotes and so on
[10:04:52] <gnarf> amaroks: any time the field gains focus, that - should - run
[10:04:56] <walidvb> any clue? :)
[10:05:01] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: this isn't really the place for that sort of question. Are you having trouble with jquery at all?
[10:05:21] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: sry wrong channel for the last question :)
[10:05:22] <amaroks> gnarf: on latest Firefox, it doesnt run when getting to that field with Tab
[10:05:54] <gnarf> amaroks: http://jsfiddle.net/XNzTL/
[10:06:05] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: it was more an optimisation question, i don't know what's the best way to do that
[10:06:21] <gnarf> also, amaroks latest? 15, 16b?
[10:07:05] <gnarf> amaroks: that fiddle works in FF 15 & 16
[10:07:20] <amaroks> gnarf: then why this isnt working :( https://gist.github.com/451d8dd815395d72357a
[10:07:56] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: so you're loading all the images at one time?
[10:08:16] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: did you have a look?
[10:08:20] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: yes
[10:08:33] <walidvb> atm, i load each first images, and when you navigate up/down, load the rest of that row
[10:09:05] <gnarf> amaroks: something else must be causing the issue
[10:09:07] <walidvb> but cycle2 has that now integrated. as said, it's not so straight-forward to implement, so I wonder if it's worth it?
[10:09:30] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: also, i generally want to speed the website up
[10:09:50] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: looking at your source code... I can see a lot of stuff in your head that can be optimized
[10:10:00] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: cheers
[10:10:49] <walidvb> i'm no expert, and have only my brain to learn from ;)
[10:11:05] <walidvb> but I would be very grateful to have insight and hints :)
[10:11:21] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: you can watch this: http://jeffsebring.com/2011/paul-irish-video-on-html5-css3-dom-optimization/
[10:11:51] <amaroks> gnarf: whats the function that checks when user type something? so I use it instead of .focus()
[10:11:58] <walidvb> pressed play :)
[10:12:33] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: http://css-tricks.com/ Chris has some really amazing stuff as well
[10:12:50] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/114-lets-do-simple-stuff-to-make-our-websites-faster/ that one in particular is great
[10:13:08] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/
[10:13:15] <walidvb> well that's the thing, i read tricks and so, but i'm not sure i'm so clean in coding, yet, you know?
[10:13:29] <walidvb> but i would love comments on my code
[10:13:31] <walidvb> :)
[10:13:48] <amaroks> gnarf: my mistake I was editing the wrong version of my app
[10:13:52] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: read anything by steve souders http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596522315.do
[10:14:24] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596529309?tag=stevsoud-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0596529309&adid=00GNM1ZWW77KSD0RERXN&
[10:16:12] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: not sure what you're using for an editor either, but every single paragraph has the same style tag.  The cleanliness of your code is less of a problem, that I can see right now, than the way your styles and JS are applied
[10:16:37] <walidvb> hm? what paragraph
[10:16:45] <walidvb> i use Coda 2
[10:17:08] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: I'm not sure what coda 2 is doing to your html, but it seems every element has inline styles
[10:17:30] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: that can cause some slow downs
[10:18:10] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: here is googles page speed test https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights
[10:18:36] <walidvb> well most inline code is from cycle2
[10:18:46] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights#url=http_3A_2F_2Fwww.vbbros.net_2Fdietz_2Fworks_2Fproject_23Same-Here&mobile=false
[10:19:26] <walidvb> reading
[10:20:07] <walidvb> most important is images.. :(
[10:20:17] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: https://gist.github.com/3848988 thats the css from your <head> all those files can be combined into one or two files
[10:20:53] <walidvb> true, but i will aggregate css when in prod
[10:21:01] <ryanneufeld> oic
[10:21:09] <walidvb> my main issue is when and how to load the images
[10:21:12] <walidvb> i think
[10:22:08] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: are you familiar with this view in the chrome tools: http://cl.ly/image/0b092D3a2w3q
[10:22:20] <shaneod> I'm trying to troubleshoot a problem I'm having. In jquery, is it possible to do an ajax request to a nonexistant file which has a htaccess 404 redirection, leading to a file which existsand prints (php) a file_get_contents response?
[10:22:26] <walidvb> yes
[10:22:34] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: cool
[10:22:48] <walidvb> and drupal aggregates .js and .css
[10:22:58] <walidvb> so that will defo be done in production
[10:23:04] <ryanneufeld> you can use some form of lazy loading then for your images, but I'm not sure how that would work for the plugins you're using
[10:23:11] <ajacom> How can I check when a certain set of images is loaded?
[10:23:27] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[10:23:27] <Guest3103> imagesLoaded() A small jQuery plugin that triggers a callback after all the selected/child images have been loaded. Because you can't do .load() on cached images. - https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[10:23:37] <walidvb> well cycle2 has this: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/progressive.php
[10:24:14] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: then, enable it
[10:24:18] <ryanneufeld> see what it does
[10:27:08] <walidvb> brb sorry
[10:27:13] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: I like the navigation idea you have, it seems that when I go up/down in a gallery all the images for that gallery are loaded. Which isn't too bad as it's only 4/5
[10:27:30] <shaneod> Does anyone know the answer to my question?
[10:28:12] <amaroks> Hello, is there a function that works like onChange() in js ?
[10:28:21] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: yep but when you go up 5 projects at once, then it loads the one you stop on last
[10:28:22] <ryanneufeld> shaneod: 404 redirection?
[10:28:32] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: that's not too bad
[10:28:44] <Kambfhase> ?change @ amaroks
[10:28:44] <Guest3103> amaroks, .change(handler): Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/change/
[10:28:55] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: well useless. i load 3 projects before the one i'm interested in.
[10:28:59] <shaneod> yeah, "ErrorDocument 404 /direct.php"
[10:29:10] <ryanneufeld> shaneod: if you are returning a 404 header, then it may not follow the redirect
[10:29:35] <ryanneufeld> shaneod: why not a 30x header instead
[10:30:08] <ryanneufeld> shaneod: like return a 301 with the correct url. And if you're simply doing an echo of file_get_contents, why not just link to the file
[10:32:05] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: but you reckon i have something good already?
[10:32:54] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: I think you could enable the progressive settings
[10:33:01] <walidvb> argh.
[10:33:19] <ryanneufeld> and have something very nice, but it depends on the size of your images
[10:33:30] <walidvb> so if I have a big DOM element to use as slide, i need to json_encode it and it will do fine
[10:33:34] <ryanneufeld> honestly, I didn't find taht it loaded very slow, but I have fast computer and fast internet
[10:33:36] <walidvb> ?
[10:34:49] <walidvb> hm so you don't need to wait too long when loading a new project? that is good news
[10:35:10] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: that said, I have a 100MB internet
[10:35:17] <ryanneufeld> so, speed isn't usually an issue for me
[10:35:51] <walidvb> hm okay
[10:36:03] <ryanneufeld> having said that, loading 4 images isn't really a big deal
[10:36:17] <ryanneufeld> and your site loads faster than the one I work on a daily basis
[10:36:37] <walidvb> could someone try and tell me??
[10:38:52] <jedimind> ryanneufeld, what site do you work on on a daily basis ?
[10:39:04] <jedimind> walidvb, a good tool to help you understand how fast/slow your site will load and why is yslow
[10:39:09] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: not sure I wanna say... LOL
[10:39:17] <jedimind> ryanneufeld, is it huggies.com ?
[10:39:49] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: LOL
[10:39:50] <ryanneufeld> no
[10:40:01] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/
[10:40:02] <jedimind> is it more embarassing than that one ?
[10:40:08] <jedimind> because i did huggies.com :)
[10:40:13] <ryanneufeld> you can see me on the /team.html page
[10:40:22] <ryanneufeld> hey man, everybody poops
[10:40:30] <ryanneufeld> my fallback career was to be a plumber
[10:40:52] <jedimind> senior code ninja, eh?
[10:40:59] <jedimind> you have the body type of a plumber!
[10:41:00] <jedimind> oh snap
[10:41:34] <ryanneufeld> dude....
[10:41:43] <walidvb> jedimind: well, in this specific case i'm still pretty convinced the site will be slow, there will be loading times, but there must be a way to do this as smart as possible
[10:41:47] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: if I had feelings, that would have hurt them all
[10:42:16] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: also most plumbers are in better shape than me :P  they actually have to work physically
[10:42:25] <jedimind> hahahah
[10:42:27] <jedimind> you know i love you
[10:42:42] <ryanneufeld> jedimind: yeah yeah
[10:42:47] <ryanneufeld> :P
[10:52:36] <sandyd> I am currently having some trouble with a jquery script I am using to scroll through divs. Each time it scrolls, it scrolls through several divs a time. I have already added a boolean so that the scroll listener will not fire at the jquery animation. The code I am using is http://pastebin.com/FQdnPLF2, and I have a test website set up already.
[10:56:50] <Xgc> sandyd: It's possible you attached the handler to multiple elements, some of which are containers of the element you intended.  So for any one click, you might fire the handler several times.
[10:57:15] <sandyd> there is no handler - it is a scrollistener
[10:59:46] <Xgc> sandyd: Same idea.  But in this case, you may just be getting more events than you expected.
[11:00:14] <sandyd> Xgc, I have throttling on.
[11:00:37] <Xgc> sandyd: Count the events in some observable way.
[11:00:37] <danmichel> I have a div that's 748px. I want the image in that div to shrink or expand depending on browser height, but at a maximum with of 748px and a maximum height of the browser window. I've tried it, but the image is stretching. NSFW: http://test.varmag.com/chebo-by-neave-bozorgi/img_9530/ Can I accomplish this with a query script?
[11:00:59] <sandyd> Xgc, I have. If I disable the scrolling animation, it works fine.
[11:01:07] <sandyd> I initially started without it.
[11:01:31] <Xgc> sandyd: So you're actually seeing multiple events, correct?
[11:01:45] <sandyd> Only with the animation on.
[11:01:53] <Xgc> sandyd: Correct.  That causes the events.
[11:02:21] <sandyd> Yes, and I added a boolean to ensure that it doesn't happen during the events - that is the part I cannot figure out.
[11:02:23] <Xgc> or, that's my guess.
[11:03:06] <Xgc> sandyd: The events are queued.
[11:03:32] <sandyd> Xgc, the event fires, but if the flag is on, it never runs anything.
[11:03:42] <sandyd> or it is *supposed* to not run anything.
[11:04:23] <Xgc> sandyd: You don't see the queued events until you're done with the first scroll event... most likely.
[11:05:15] <sandyd> the events are not queued - if the scroll sends events while the animation is unfinished, they are simply returned.
[11:05:55] <sandyd> i.e. if (threadrunning) return;
[11:06:31] <star_prone> Hi
[11:06:46] <star_prone> how can I get the value of the class attribute
[11:07:24] <sandyd> star_prone, of a div?
[11:07:44] <star_prone> yes
[11:08:00] <sandyd> .attr('class')
[11:08:10] <sandyd> .attr('id') if you want an id
[11:15:26] <Jeroene> hello :)
[11:15:46] <dabear> hola
[11:16:16] <Jeroene> I need a variable that counts up (timer++) and when it reaches a number (for example 100) it show a text.
[11:16:25] <Jeroene> but I can't get it working.. :-/
[11:16:35] <Jeroene> $(document).ready(function () { 		  var counter = 0; 		  counter++; 		  if (counter == 10) { $("p.la").text("The DOM is now loaded and can be manipulated."); } 		});
[11:16:58] <ravenzz> ..
[11:17:13] <dabear> if you set counter to 0
[11:17:16] <ravenzz> ok the sample text is pretty silly
[11:17:19] <dabear> and then increase counter by 1
[11:17:24] <dabear> the counter will not be ten
[11:17:31] <Jeroene> I know
[11:17:41] <dabear> ?mdc settimeout @ Jeroene
[11:17:42] <Guest3103> Jeroene, window.setTimeout - Mozilla Developer Network - Calls a function or executes a code snippet after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.setTimeout
[11:18:04] <Jeroene> I want to keep adding 1 to the counter
[11:18:05] <Jeroene> but how?
[11:18:39] <dabear> Jeroene: https://www.google.no/search?q=javascript+how+to+create+a+timer&oq=javascript+how+to+create+a+timer&sugexp=chrome,mod=16&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
[11:18:51] <Jeroene> a while?
[11:20:20] <ravenzz> Jeroene what are you trying to do?
[11:20:43] <Jeroene> I want to add a text to the <p class="la"></p> after 10 and 20 seconds.
[11:21:04] <Jeroene> and I know 10 != 10 seconds..
[11:21:07] <Jeroene> but just tried
[11:21:10] <Jeroene> if that should work :p
[11:21:11] <ravenzz> ah ok
[11:21:14] <ravenzz> so setTimeout
[11:21:20] <ravenzz> is the way to go
[11:21:48] <ravenzz> setTimeout(yourFunction, 10000);
[11:24:18] <sandyd> Can someone check over my jQuery code (http://pastebin.com/FQdnPLF2), and tell me why the events are still firing even though I have added a boolen to stop firing during the scroll animation?
[11:24:25] <sandyd> *listener
[11:24:38] <Jeroene> doesn't work :(
[11:26:16] <Jeroene> Sandyd
[11:26:18] <Jeroene> what's wrong? :s
[11:26:19] <Jeroene> 		<script type="text/javascript"> 		$(document).ready(function () { 		 var counter = 0; 		 setTimeout(processing, 10000); 		 function processing(){ 		    counter++; 		  } 		  if (counter == 10) { $("p.la").text("Test 1"); } 		});         </script>
[11:26:39] <ravenzz> uh?
[11:27:43] <ravenzz> $(document).ready(function () { function processing() { $("p.la").text("test"); } setTimeout(processing, 10000); });
[11:27:45] <ravenzz> that's all
[11:32:29] <Jeroene> Thanks :D

[11:37:24] <ryanneufeld> that shouldn't be that
[11:37:36] <ryanneufeld> star_prone: https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&sqi=2&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FJavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FString%2Fsplit&ei=6ctxUPbXAeXDigKYw4CQAg&usg=AFQjCNGkwSHZ6ZUgUnlUkP4Ml_kfZIoU2w
[11:37:41] <Kambfhase> wtf?
[11:38:07] <ryanneufeld> link fail https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
[11:38:29] <Mr_Grim> is there anything in jQuery to do wildcard searches for an array of strings?
[11:38:46] <Kambfhase> there are regexp
[11:39:23] <Kambfhase> (they only work on strings, thouhg. not arrays of strings)
[11:39:46] <Mr_Grim> so i can just loop through the array
[11:39:46] <Mr_Grim> okay
[11:40:36] <star_prone> Kambfhase: thank you
[11:40:43] <Kambfhase> np
[11:41:12] <Kambfhase> this.soulsSaved++;
[11:46:36] <zygote> http://jsfiddle.net/zYaE5/ can someone please help me figure out why this "test" alert won't trigger?
[11:47:24] <Kambfhase> alert ist not a debugger
[11:47:34] <Kambfhase> Mootools?
[11:47:36] <zygote> what do you suggest?
[11:47:41] <ryanneufeld> console.log
[11:47:44] <zygote> nope jquery
[11:48:09] <ryanneufeld> well, you're loading mootools on your fiddle
[11:48:11] <Kambfhase> YOu have to select jQ from the dropdown on the left
[11:48:14] <zygote> okay but the alert should still trigger, no?
[11:48:24] <ryanneufeld> why are you using tostring?
[11:48:34] <zygote> i switched it to jquery, perhaps the link doesn't reflect that
[11:48:45] <ryanneufeld> you have to click update
[11:48:46] <ryanneufeld> to save it
[11:48:49] <zygote> i was just testing if it was a type error, even though i wasn't comparing for tip. just a test
[11:49:02] <ryanneufeld> alert works for me
[11:49:16] <ryanneufeld> when I select jquery instead of mootools
[11:49:57] <zygote> i've definitely got jquery selected and still doesn't work for me. weird
[11:50:18] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/zYaE5/3/
[11:51:19] <zygote> the original link wasn't updated. i wanted to test the alert inside of the if statement
[11:51:25] <zygote> that is the difficulty im having
[11:51:50] <ryanneufeld> zygote: that link I gave you is the original with the alert working=\
[11:52:13] <Kambfhase> zygote: why not make smthn like this: $(this).is(".sub-price-box-off")
[11:52:26] <Kambfhase> ryanneufeld: he's talking bout the second alert ;)
[11:52:31] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:52:43] <zygote> http://jsfiddle.net/zYaE5/7/
[11:53:05] <Kambfhase> again, instead of comparing plain strings, use selectors
[11:53:26] <zygote> ya thats a smart way of doing this
[11:54:05] <Kambfhase> plus, it doesn't break that easily.
[11:54:08] <ryanneufeld> zygote: http://jsfiddle.net/zYaE5/8/
[11:54:13] <Kambfhase> classes can be rearranged.
[11:54:30] <ryanneufeld> zygote: slightly better: http://jsfiddle.net/zYaE5/9/
[11:54:45] <Kambfhase> oh, yeah. .hasClass()
[11:55:23] <ryanneufeld> :)
[11:55:24] <zygote> oh haha. forgot about hasclass. I really need to re-familiarize myself with jquery methods. Thanks guys.
[11:55:27] <ryanneufeld> ?hasclass
[11:55:27] <Guest3103> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[11:55:28] <ryanneufeld> ?is
[11:55:28] <Guest3103> .is(selector): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[11:55:38] <ryanneufeld> either one of those will work for you
[11:56:21] <zygote> all this said. i still dont get why the string comparison didn't work
[11:56:31] <ryanneufeld> it was working for me
[11:56:35] <ryanneufeld> never wasn't
[11:56:43] <zygote> inside the if statement?
[11:56:46] <ryanneufeld> yes
[11:56:56] <zygote> oh then something must be messed on my end
[11:57:00] <zygote> very frustrating
[11:57:07] <ryanneufeld> sometimes with jsfiddle I found I've had to update
[11:57:12] <ryanneufeld> and then refresh the browser
[11:57:27] <ryanneufeld> syntax errors can get 'stuck' in the browser session
[11:57:28] <zygote> ya. probably just need to restart my browser in general
[11:57:32] <ryanneufeld> usually a refresh fixes it
[11:58:44] <jorn> hey, searching for this for quite a while now and guess it's pretty easy… i want the max-height of a couple of children of some div: this doesn't seem to work: Math.max($('#papa').children().each(function(){ return $(this).height(); });
[11:59:25] <ryanneufeld> jorn: each doesn't work that way
[11:59:27] <malinens> Hi! I have html code in variable html_contents = '<div><p id="test"></p></div>'; how can I use selector on this string. for example html_contents.find('p').attr('id') ?
[11:59:59] <Kambfhase> $(html_contents).find()...
[11:59:59] <ryanneufeld> jorn: since you're only returning the height of the last item.
[12:00:28] <jorn> ryanneufeld: i noticed ;) but isn't there some map which actually lets you return values?
[12:00:57] <jorn> Kambfhase: i can't see how that works, can you elaborate?
[12:01:10] <ryanneufeld> jorn: he was answeering malinens
[12:01:21] <Kambfhase> jorn: a) that wasn't to you b) try .map()
[12:01:32] <ryanneufeld> jorn: see ?map
[12:01:33] <Guest3103> jorn, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[12:01:53] <jorn> lol, sorry that was dumb
[12:02:26] <ryanneufeld> jorn: we get dumb questions all the time. Yours wasn't that dumb
[12:02:35] <ryanneufeld> you had the right idea, but the wrong method
[12:02:41] <jorn> there's some saying like this in german: "couldn't see the forest cause of all the trees"...
[12:02:47] <ryanneufeld> map should do what you want
[12:02:50] <Kambfhase> Dont worry, thats what i get paid for. answering dumb questions on #jquery
[12:03:07] <ryanneufeld> jorn: we have that in enlgish as well
[12:03:20] <ryanneufeld> though I'm sure it sounds less terrifying in engligh
[12:03:34] <jorn> always thought .each is jquery's map ;)
[12:03:49] <ryanneufeld> jorn: (I work with someone from Munic, she shouts things at me in german all the time)
[12:04:01] <jorn> hehe
[12:04:30] <jorn> aww, maybe i should just stop coding for today… thanks for the help
[12:04:53] <ryanneufeld> They say you should tell the people you love that you love them every day, because life is short. But you should also shout it at them in German as life is confusing and terrifying as well
[12:07:06] <Kambfhase> Hey Ryan -- What? -- Ryan! -- What? -- ICH LIEBE DICH! ICH WILL EIN KIND VON DIR! -- Waaaahhhh!

[12:08:10] <sonotos> Kambfhase: go to my ex and take one of them...
[12:08:12] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: you may not have a child from me

[12:10:26] <Celene> Can someone check over my jQuery code (http://pastebin.com/FQdnPLF2), and tell me why the events are still firing even though I have added a boolen to stop firing during the scroll animation?
[12:11:18] <Kambfhase> Celene: this is jshint.com use it wisely
[12:12:26] <Frantic> guys, can someone please point me to a site which is what the docs.jquery.com is to jquery, but for CSS? somethign that tells you the options to the position property, etc. Sorry, I realize this is the jQuery channel, but I have no idea where to ask specifically
[12:13:57] <Kambfhase> Frantic: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference
[12:14:29] <Frantic> Kambfhase: that looks great, thank you!
[12:14:42] * Kambfhase this.soulsSaved++
[12:18:01] <AndreKR> Oh, now there's some people here. :)
[12:18:20] <malinens> Kambfhase: thanks!
[12:18:25] <Kambfhase> np
[12:18:27] <AndreKR> I still wonder where I can find the plugin that is described on http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins:Forms.
[12:18:48] <Kambfhase> "There is currently no text in this page. You can search for this page title in other pages, or search the related logs, but you do not have permission to create this page. " ?
[12:20:19] <AndreKR> Don't copy the dot, sorry. :)
[12:20:40] <shoky> AndreKR: this? http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/
[12:20:46] <AndreKR> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins:Forms
[12:22:32] <AndreKR> shoky: Is it? I found that one but I couldn't find any connection between the pages. But ok then, thanks.
[12:22:48] <shoky> no connection?
[12:23:16] <shoky> same API
[12:24:30] <AndreKR> Yes, I didn't check thoroughly, I found a lot of plugins dealing with forms... quite confusing.
[12:25:20] <AndreKR> And I've seen enough open source software to know that "similar API" != "same thing". ;)
[12:26:02] <Kambfhase> yeah, Linux and OSX both are posix compliant.
[12:26:03] <TiffanyAmber> hi guys! question about Jquery, I'm noob. Can I have two $(document).ready(function() {    ???
[12:26:08] <Kambfhase> yes
[12:26:18] <ryanneufeld> TiffanyAmber: yes, you may
[12:26:23] <ryanneufeld> Tell them I said you're allowed
[12:26:38] <TiffanyAmber> ;-) thanks guys!
[12:26:38] <Kambfhase> i can has $.ready plz?
[12:26:43] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: They are mostly POSIX
[12:26:53] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: no! you've had your share
[12:26:56] <TiffanyAmber> I'm trying to have a bootstrap modal box popup automatically
[12:26:58] <Kambfhase> :(
[12:27:03] <Kambfhase> *sniff*
[12:28:28] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: FINE! you may also have one
[12:28:30] <ryanneufeld> JUST ONE!
[12:28:34] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:28:43] <Kambfhase> yay! \o/
[12:28:56] <sonotos> hm jshint.com  is complaining about the syntax with + in http://pastebin.com/LKLfD8bQ
[12:29:33] <shoky> anybody would complain about that snippet
[12:29:44] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's pretty fugly
[12:30:15] <sonotos>  + '' in a new line?
[12:30:27] <ryanneufeld> oh, html in js
[12:30:39] <ryanneufeld> * -oh +no
[12:30:51] <Kambfhase> ryanneufeld: "PHP Developer by Day." Life's a bitch, eh?
[12:31:08] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: haha
[12:31:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I can make PHP do pretty much anything I want
[12:31:26] <ryanneufeld> so it's not that bad
[12:31:36] <ryanneufeld> and trust me, I've seen some shite PHP code
[12:31:55] <sonotos> ryanneufeld: well i'm aware of seperating markup an logic, but the the question was about the syntax with the + seperated string
[12:32:06] <ryanneufeld> what was the error?
[12:32:39] <sonotos> it says: Bad line breaking before '+'.
[12:32:49] <ryanneufeld> so, what does that mean?
[12:32:51] <ryanneufeld> http://cl.ly/image/410F2A2v0G24
[12:34:52] <sonotos> it seams to work in all browsers but as i understood the syntax is "wrong"
[12:35:11] <Kambfhase> its not 'wrong'
[12:35:18] <Kambfhase> its just 'bad stile'
[12:35:23] <ryanneufeld> Kambfhase: style
[12:35:24] <Kambfhase> -i+y
[12:35:36] <ryanneufeld> sonotos: do you know about automatic semicolon insertion?
[12:35:41] <sonotos> yes
[12:36:05] <ryanneufeld> so, can you see why not having a control character like a semi colon, or in  this case the + on the end of a line
[12:36:25] <ryanneufeld> can be dangerous
[12:37:00] <ryanneufeld> if you missed the last semi colon on that concatenation, it could lead to asi and cause unexpected results
[12:37:10] <sonotos> hm yes i see
[12:37:49] <goddard> anyone know how i can trigger a tab change
[12:37:50] <sonotos> thx
[12:37:53] <goddard> im using the jquery ui
[12:38:26] <ryanneufeld> sonotos: np
[12:38:37] <ryanneufeld> goddard: see ?trigger
[12:38:37] <Guest3103> goddard, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:39:21] <goddard> ryanneufeld: appreciate that but im not that advanced
[12:39:23] <sonotos> what would be a good way in javascript to get the markup out of rendering logic for items?
[12:39:37] <ryanneufeld> goddard: that's not that advanced dude
[12:39:49] <sonotos> jquery.template seams not yet to be stable if i remember correct
[12:40:00] <ryanneufeld> $(selector for the target tab).trigger('click')
[12:40:04] <goddard> well i dont even knoww all that stuff you typed
[12:40:24] <ryanneufeld> goddard: then you'd better start reading the manual :)
[12:40:26] <goddard> ahh ok
[12:40:30] <goddard> that makes sense
[12:40:31] <ryanneufeld> goddard: jsfiddle.net
[12:40:35] <ryanneufeld> is a good playground
[12:40:44] <ryanneufeld> you can test concepts in an isolated way
[12:41:02] <goddard> alright thanks bro
[12:41:08] <ryanneufeld> sonotos: there are many many templating libs, handlebars, moustache
[12:41:12] <ryanneufeld> sonotos: angluar
[12:43:13] <sonotos> ryanneufeld: hm ok, that was to obvious. thx
[12:56:31] <imsky> inside
[12:57:22] <ryanneufeld> outside
[12:57:35] <imsky> no you're not don't lie
[12:57:45] <ryanneufeld> I could be
[12:57:51] <ryanneufeld> you don't knwo
[12:58:01] <imsky> why dont you tweet the view
[12:58:01] <walidvb> does anyone know why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/DvaeX/
[12:58:20] <Kambfhase> "isn't working" ist not a valid problem description.
[12:58:21] <ryanneufeld> walidvb: yesh
[12:58:23] <ryanneufeld> I do
[12:58:25] <walidvb> it seems somehow the replace is run before the log
[12:58:30] <ryanneufeld> your links are all to localhost
[12:58:39] <ryanneufeld> so we won't be able to see them
[12:58:50] <walidvb> if i remove the erplaceWith, the console logs the element
[12:59:05] <walidvb> ryanneufeld: hm well that's one thing, but check what the console logs
[12:59:23] <walidvb> Kambfhase: haha hey give me a minute to explain ;P
[12:59:51] <imsky> nah you're doing the replaceWith all wrong
[12:59:54] <Kambfhase> change to "onLoad" and this start working!
[12:59:57] <imsky> ryan doesn't know what he's talking about
[13:00:42] <ryanneufeld> wait, wut
[13:01:29] <ryanneufeld> it's logging the jquery collection of imhs
[13:01:52] <jif> hi #jquery
[13:02:04] <walidvb> imsky: how so?
[13:02:09] <jif> I have a question about scripting with forms
[13:02:10] <imsky> hang on
[13:02:17] <walidvb> i used the exact same code elsewhere, it works just fine
[13:02:28] <walidvb> (ok, not exact, but still ;) )
[13:02:32] <imsky> did you
[13:02:43] <jif> www.ipetitions.com/petition/removefluorideil -- lines 223 and 231
[13:03:01] <walidvb> well i use to call it from a DOM level higher, but the replaceWith hasn't changed
[13:03:06] <jif> I am told the only way to take one input for one form and use it in another form is with server side scripting
[13:03:06] <fourcolors> hello, I have a div item called map that has two data attributes data-lat and data-lng . I'm trying to bind to those data attributes an event when either the lat or lng changes. Basically, if those attrubutes change, I'm going to center the map to those lat/lng coords
[13:03:29] <fourcolors> The problem is, .data('lat') returns an objecdt, not a jquery objects
[13:03:45] <imsky> walidvb: http://jsfiddle.net/DvaeX/1/
[13:03:54] <walidvb> and I selected in that way: $('a.link-to-img', incoming)
[13:03:54] <imsky> remove the other console.log and you're set
[13:03:58] <fourcolors> which means doing $(#map).data('lat').on('change', function(event){blah}) doesn't work
[13:04:31] <fourcolors> how can I check that that data attrubte changed
[13:04:56] <walidvb> imsky: well that's what changed, actually. it used to work with img.each(), but i need to run the code on one elemnt only (i use it within a cycle, so i want to load the image when i go to that slide.)
[13:05:06] <walidvb> oh.
[13:05:09] <imsky> lol
[13:05:22] <imsky> brother i'm available for freelance if you're having jquery problems
[13:05:25] <imsky> let me know if i can help
[13:05:43] <walidvb> imsky: so more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/DvaeX/2/
[13:05:48] <walidvb> imsky: talking to me?
[13:05:51] <imsky> yeah
[13:05:56] <walidvb> lol
[13:05:58] <imsky> that'll work too
[13:06:10] <imsky> you don't really need the img variable at that point
[13:06:13] <walidvb> well console log is empty
[13:07:35] <imsky> console log isn't empty
[13:08:02] <walidvb> imsky: and replaceWith(<img/>, {src: ...}) is correct, too.
[13:08:15] <walidvb> hm i get nothing in my log, except the text, but not the url
[13:11:00] <shoky> walidvb: the replaceWith is not correct
[13:12:12] <shoky> walidvb: http://jsfiddle.net/DvaeX/4/
[13:12:21] <shoky> oh imsky said that already.
[13:12:22] <walidvb> shoky: ...maybe it's because i call it on the wrong type of element, but it IS possible to use it that way, too. I must be missing some detail, but it does work
[13:12:48] <walidvb> shoky: yay
[13:12:50] <shoky> walidvb: it's possible to do it that way but your problem is your usage of 'this'
[13:12:56] <walidvb> exactly
[13:13:04] <shoky> putting it inside an object literal doesn't change the value of 'this'
[13:13:09] <shoky> you need the function
[13:13:33] <imsky> shoky++
[13:13:39] <imsky> you helpful robot
[13:13:45] <shoky> ehe ehe
[13:21:51] <walidvb> thx guys
[13:21:53] <walidvb> need a minute
[13:24:22] <fission6> anyone got a recommendation for a wysiwyg editor
[13:24:44] <ryanneufeld> in what sense?
[13:25:18] <fission6> i want to use one on my site
[13:25:38] <ryanneufeld> ?g jquery wysiwyg editor @ fission6
[13:25:38] <tw2113> jquery doesn't really work well with wysiwyg
[13:25:39] <Guest3103> fission6, Redactor WYSIWYG editor on jQuery - http://redactorjs.com/
[13:25:47] <tw2113> in terms of writing it
[13:25:53] <tw2113> dunno about any powered by jquery
[13:26:51] <fission6> i like this, let me review, thanks
[13:28:08] <walidvb> i agree
[13:29:05] <walidvb> shoky: but i don't understand why 'this' is different in your code
[13:29:11] <fission6> thanks
[13:29:39] <ryanneufeld> fission6: FYI, that was the first google result :P
[13:31:43] <shoky> walidvb: in my code, i am passing a callback to .replaceWith.  replaceWith calls that callback , changing the context ('this') to the current element
[13:31:55] <shoky> walidvb: in your code, nothing is changing the context ('this')
[13:32:32] <fourcolors> how can I bind an event to check to see if a data attribute changes on a dom element?
[13:32:55] <walidvb> and performance-wise, does it make a difference to: replace $('.link') everytime i go to a slide(.link will exist only once, replace will do nothing on next calls), or || replace if($('.link').data('has-been-replaced')) only?
[13:33:10] <walidvb> shoky: so what is 'this' in my code?
[13:33:26] <shoky> walidvb: whatever it was before the call to .replaceWith.  probably the global window object
[13:33:38] <walidvb> oh.
[13:34:20] <znowi> is $.map not working with a jquery set?
[13:34:46] <shoky> znowi: it does
[13:35:23] <fourcolors> anyone know how I can do that?
[13:36:49] <fourcolors> anyone?
[13:36:50] <znowi> shoky: hmm, i do $.map(set, function(el, i){el.id;}), but it yields an empty object
[13:37:04] <shoky> fourcolors: you can't really, not in a cross-browser way at least. you are much better off recognizing where the changes to the attribute are being made, maybe triggering some event there
[13:37:46] <shoky> znowi: you forgot return ?
[13:37:48] <fourcolors> well thats a shame :(
[13:38:39] <znowi> shoky: oh, crap! i blame ruby :)
[13:38:44] <znowi> thanks
[13:38:47] <shoky> ;p

[13:46:56] <walidvb> so not the element on which replaceWith is called
[13:46:57] <walidvb> (sry toooooo many ppl talking to me here ;) )
[13:47:10] <walidvb> thanks for your help
[13:48:08] <colegatron> I want to use jquerymobile as a base framework for frontend in desktop and mobile sites, but it lacks (for the non-mobile sites) of some useful widgets. I thought to use jquery ui, but seems they are incompatible.
[13:48:32] <colegatron> does some one uses other library/framework together with jquerymobile?
[13:50:52] <colegatron> any advice?

[14:05:13] <jvm_> hi. i searched for hours, and tried to find the bug, regarding a problem with two jquery ui sliders on one page, and only one of them working. sometimes both worked, but i couldn't reproduce. i tried different jquery versions & combinations and couldn't track it down. eventually, i compared ui slider git history and couldn't find the problem. after using uncompressed code, i found the problem in closestHandle being undefined. the uncommented c
[14:05:13] <jvm_> ode setting that variable i don't really understand, but a solution that probably would break sliders with multiple handles, that simply sets closestHandle to whatever handle we find (instead of using some code to find the right one) fixed the problem -- both sliders worked afterwards. is anyone aware of a bug  like that with jquery 1.8.1 & ui 1.8.23 as well as with jquery 1.8.2 & ui 1,8.24?
[14:13:08] <Kambfhase> jvm_: you might want to open a ticket
[14:13:37] <jvm_> Kambfhase, the problem is -- i am not sure what the problem is. hehe.
[14:13:45] <Kambfhase> :)
[14:14:33] <jvm_> Kambfhase, i only know that the code that selects closestHandle seems to be not fail proof.
[14:17:08] <Logikos> can someone please tell me why .trgger() apears to do nothing here... http://jsfiddle.net/hGNhG/
[14:17:46] <Kambfhase> afaik you cannot trigger a hyperlink
[14:18:16] <Kambfhase> it triggers the click event, but the new page does not get loaded
[14:19:38] <Logikos> then what good is .trigger() ? ... i'm useing a lightbox called shadowbox .. and i want to trigger the click event on that link, so that shadowbox will do what it does if you had clicked it
[14:19:57] <Logikos> obviously this jsfiddle test has nothign ot do with shadowbox, i was just trying to get that to work
[14:20:08] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: you can use trigger to do that
[14:20:22] <ianawilson> Hi all, I'm getting this error: property 'jQuery' of object [object Window] is not a function, even though my jquery <script> tag is before my script that is causing this error
[14:20:40] <Logikos> ryanneufeld: am i doing it wrong? because its not working?
[14:21:07] <Kambfhase> ?demo @ ianawilson
[14:21:07] <Guest3103> ianawilson, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:21:49] <derPepo> ianawilson: is your document ready? :)
[14:22:09] <ianawilson> derPepo: the line that is causing the error is jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[14:22:30] <derPepo> the path to jquery is right?
[14:22:52] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: I'm looking
[14:23:08] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: setInterval?
[14:23:25] <ianawilson> derPepo: jQuery is loaded and ready to use in the console
[14:23:54] <derPepo> sorry now i need the example too :-(
[14:24:38] <Logikos> ryanneufeld: a client wants an anouncments page which displays on a screen with no interaction by anyone, to auto play a video in a lightbox once every 10 mins or so
[14:24:59] <ryanneufeld> talk them out of it? :p
[14:25:48] <Logikos> ryanseddon: i tried.. lol but regardless of the fact that its a stupid idea... it seems that it should be possible to do .. do you know the $().trigger('click') apears to do nothing in this case?
[14:26:19] <Logikos> and i do realize i have the interval time set to 10 seconds not 10 mins... its just for testing purposes right now
[14:26:21] <garbagecollectio> if i call a function again with different data when it is not done processing
[14:26:25] <garbagecollectio> what happens
[14:26:59] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: Yeah, I'm thinking that what's happening here is that there is no jquery event bound to the click handler on the the link
[14:27:04] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: so nothing is happening
[14:27:34] <ryanneufeld> Logikos: what you'd likely have to do is window.location.href = $(a).attr('href');
[14:27:45] <ryanneufeld> to simulate what you're trying to do here
[14:28:35] <goddard> can anyone look at this http://pastebin.com/xYYcvLYa
[14:28:40] <Logikos> shadowbox is not useing jquery to listen for the click event ... its just useing raw javascript
[14:28:40] <goddard> why am i getting this error
[14:28:48] <Logikos> but i didnt think it should matter...
[14:29:24] <goddard> http://pastebin.com/qHt7p65Y
[14:29:28] <goddard> that one is better
[14:29:34] <Logikos> i supose i should just lookup how to use the shadowbox.open() to do this...
[14:29:45] <ryanneufeld> maybe
[14:30:10] <ryanneufeld> goddard: that error is meaningless without the code that caused
[14:30:18] <ryanneufeld> goddard: can you paste that as well?
[14:30:52] <jvm_> Kambfhase, https://gist.github.com/3745667 is 19 days old, describes the same problem and has the same solution as i. don't know if it is a good one, and don't know why the problem suddenly came up, for i can not see the difference from current to 1 yyear old ui-slider code. now that i have code that would work, how do i minify it?
[14:31:56] <ryanneufeld> jvm_: if you think it's a bug, you should report it. Be sure to have a jsfiddle example of how to reproduce the problem
[14:31:56] <Kambfhase> jvm_: take that snipper, plug it into jQ code and minify here: http://alexsexton.com/uglifui/
[14:32:42] <jvm_> ryanneufeld, i linked the ticket. someone else already reported it and gave a solution.
[14:33:04] <jvm_> thanks Kambfhase.
[14:33:07] <ryanneufeld> ah, sorry, was afk, must have missed that
[14:34:15] <star_prone> how can I check if a variable is empty?
[14:34:29] <ryanneufeld> empty or undefined?
[14:34:41] <star_prone> empty
[14:34:42] <goddard> ryanneufeld: im using redactor text editor
[14:34:55] <star_prone> except for varName == ""
[14:35:16] <ryanneufeld> star_prone: that looks like it would work
[14:35:20] <goddard> ryanneufeld: i get that error when using their file upload example
[14:35:40] <ryanneufeld> goddard: typically when I've seen that error
[14:35:44] <goddard> ryanneufeld: http://redactorjs.com/docs/files/
[14:35:58] <ryanneufeld> it's been because I was using an ajax end point that was return html
[14:36:14] <star_prone> it does
[14:36:22] <star_prone> I wanted to know if there is an alternative
[14:36:29] <star_prone> what about udefined?
[14:36:43] <goddard> yeah i read that those errors are similar to what others have gotten some said it was mime type related but i checked and i have a applicat/json in my mime types in cpanel

[14:38:28] <jh67> another quick question
[14:38:33] <Kambfhase> ah, Yoda-Statements, them i like
[14:38:37] <jh67> I am trying to send a POST request
[14:38:48] <jh67> I cant seem to be able to send it
[14:38:55] <Kambfhase> ?p @ jh67
[14:38:55] <Guest3103> jh67, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:40:49] <jh67> I will paste it on pastebin
[14:41:17] <jvm_> Kambfhase, ryanneufeld actually i am a bit confused. https://gist.github.com/3745667 documents the bug, but is not in the jquer ticket database.
[14:41:34] <jvm_> at least i couldnt find it.
[14:41:40] <Kambfhase> dunno
[14:41:45] <jh67> http://pastebin.com/6y7JWDFe
[14:41:53] <jh67> it seems alrite to me
[14:42:01] <jh67> but I must be making a mistake somewhere
[14:43:41] <jh67> I think the problem
[14:43:45] <jh67> might be the postData
[14:43:47] <jh67> part
[14:44:05] <jh67> as I couldn't find some example with more than a variable to send in post
[14:44:19] <jh67> the rest is more or less as it was before, when I didn't use the server-side page
[15:00:20] <star_prone> is there a javascript way to set cursor: pointer without using css

[15:03:03] <star_prone> let me try pls
[15:04:08] <houman> Hi, Is anyone using jquery-raty by any chance? https://github.com/wbotelhos/raty  I don't understand how to create a click event handler on a star? Does anyone know?
[15:04:37] <star_prone> ain't working for me
[15:04:56] <star_prone> it's because i have multiple layers
[15:05:03] <star_prone> orderd with z-index
[15:05:29] <star_prone> and on mouse over the element with the biggest z-index
[15:06:05] <star_prone> the browser will not see my action on the element I'm trying to set the pointer...

[15:07:55] <Guest3103> star_prone, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:08:17] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:08:38] <arielserafini> mornin'
[15:10:10] <star_prone> just a sec
[15:16:19] <jh67> morning ppl
[15:16:25] <jh67> I dont get this
[15:16:32] <jh67> in the console on chrome
[15:16:34] <jh67> the code works
[15:16:40] <jh67> on the page it doesn't
[15:20:53] <BinaryKitten> jh67 do you have the code loaded in the <head></head> section?
[15:21:16] <jh67> in the <script> section
[15:21:26] <jh67> I dont have any head for the moment
[15:21:27] <BinaryKitten> ok and where does that sit?
[15:21:43] <BinaryKitten> before or after the elements that it's affecting?
[15:21:49] <jh67> before
[15:21:52] <BinaryKitten> ok
[15:21:57] <jh67>  have <html>
[15:22:00] <jh67> imports
[15:22:03] <jh67> <script>
[15:22:08] <jh67> <form>
[15:22:09] <BinaryKitten> that's the issue. The elements have not loaded yet when the script runs
[15:22:24] <BinaryKitten> so the system can't find them
[15:22:27] <jh67> but it was working before
[15:22:35] <BinaryKitten> in console you said
[15:22:35] <jh67> now I just changed the back end
[15:22:39] <jh67> yeah
[15:22:42] <jh67> but that part
[15:22:46] <BinaryKitten> in console everything is loaded
[15:22:47] <jh67> is about an autocomplete
[15:22:57] <jh67> so
[15:23:03] <jh67> should I move that afte the form?
[15:23:06] <jh67> anyway, the error
[15:23:10] <jh67> is about an array
[15:23:10] <BinaryKitten> place the linking code after the elements being used.. best place is before the </body>
[15:23:12] <jh67> which is correct
[15:23:46] <jh67> same error
[15:23:53] <jh67> Cannot read property 'hits' of undefined
[15:24:10] <BinaryKitten> ok please pastebin your code (preferably using jsfiddle.ne
[15:24:16] <BinaryKitten> *jsfiddle.net)
[15:25:28] <jh67> http://jsfiddle.net/2Cwzr/
[15:25:31] <jh67> here it is
[15:25:42] <jh67> Im gonna paste there
[15:25:50] <jh67> actually
[15:25:54] <jh67> what do u prefer
[15:26:07] <jh67> there or pastebin for the json response I am trying to get the info from
[15:26:07] <jh67> ?
[15:26:51] <BinaryKitten> jh67 lets see what is what at least
[15:26:59] <shoky> jh67: what does the ajax response look like?
[15:27:05] <shoky> yea pastebin the json
[15:27:08] <jh67> ok
[15:27:41] <shoky> oh, wait
[15:27:46] <shoky> dataType: 'html'
[15:27:53] <BinaryKitten> shoky yep
[15:27:55] <shoky> jh67: but your response is not html
[15:28:09] <shoky> jh67: prolly need to change that to dataType: 'json'
[15:28:11] <jh67> http://pastebin.com/wgYthEk0
[15:28:20] <jh67> ah ok
[15:28:30] <jh67> but isn't that the type of request?
[15:28:41] <shoky> no it's the data type of the response
[15:28:42] <shoky> read the docs
[15:28:51] <jh67> it worked
[15:28:55] <jh67> .-
[15:28:59] <shoky> kul
[15:29:01] <jh67> thank you shoky! :D
[15:29:04] <jh67> so easy
[15:29:15] <jh67> and BinaryKitten of course
[15:29:22] <jh67> anyway, just another one
[15:29:23] <shoky> ;]
[15:29:28] <jh67> I want to catch any erorr
[15:29:30] <jh67> error}
[15:29:38] <BinaryKitten> any?
[15:29:42] <jh67> 1 sec
[15:29:53] <jh67> just to not have errors popping up in the console
[15:30:12] <jh67> actually
[15:30:13] <jh67> no need
[15:30:16] <jh67> :D
[15:33:24] <lampe2> hey i got a slider vertical and a resizeable object. now i when i press on the slider button i wanne not only make it go down and up but when i drag the mouse left and right it should resize it to. her is my gist: https://gist.github.com/3849812
[15:33:31] <lampe2> can someone help maybe?
[15:53:02] <rgenito> ok so this isn't exactly a jquery question....but more of an "implementation" question in general :D for the GODS of jquery! (you guys)
[15:53:29] <rgenito> i'm trying to make a loading mask over a div...and my first thought is just to have a div hover "over" the div i want to cover-up (and disable)
[15:53:47] <rgenito> is that pretty much how people do it? of course, i cannot find an example of this when i want one =|
[15:54:05] <rgenito> so i'm trying to figure out how to make a div that hovers over another div using jquery
[15:55:20] <astropirate> rgenito, might be easier to just cover the hole page... but if it requires it yah just cover that div. find out its height, width, location and you are good to go
[15:55:24] <astropirate> if its location isnt static
[15:55:34] <astropirate> then make sure to adjust its location on page resizes
[15:56:06] <rgenito> ahh
[15:57:42] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i recently rearranged some jquery code and now get an TypeError: $.fbmodal is not a function is not function error on almost every jquery function or method im calling
[15:58:27] <jarr0dsz> have checked all js includes but unable to figure out why this happens, anyone ideas on how you can fix this? whats normally the cause, jquery 1.7 seems to be included fine
[15:59:38] <BillCriswell> jarr0dsz: Are you calling it before you've included the plugin?
[16:00:05] <jarr0dsz> BillCriswell: i have a jquery.*.js and a loader.js in each directory i make sure the loader.js is called after including the library
[16:00:20] <jarr0dsz> i organized js library's in subfolders of /js/
[16:02:58] <jarr0dsz> setting a facebok modal with http://pastie.org/4929822 for example (loader.js)
[16:03:09] <jarr0dsz> should i place a .ready method around that perhaps
[16:04:00] <BillCriswell> jarr0dsz: Did you move the code to the <head>?
[16:04:38] <jarr0dsz> BillCriswell: yes i have before it was autoincluded part of a application now i include them manually and this error pops up everywhere
[16:04:56] <jarr0dsz> seems like the facemodal plugin is not loaded at all
[16:05:19] <BrandonC> hey all.. this function works, but when i change height to line-height, the px is missing.. http://pastebin.com/4yMAG6bV
[16:05:26] <lampe2> hey how can i make a resizeable object not resize from the bottom but from the top ?
[16:05:36] <BrandonC> how can i have height and line-height based of width?
[16:05:52] <jarr0dsz> the facebox modal plugin is loaded with (function($) { ... })(jQuery);
[16:06:00] <jarr0dsz> could that somehoe cause issues? ... is the plugin code
[16:06:17] <rgenito> astropirate, thanks for the input :) i'm looking up how to find out its position now :D
[16:07:07] <BillCriswell> jarr0dsz: It just sounds like you're calling it before it's defined.
[16:07:24] <lampe2> okay i hot it :)
[16:07:35] <jarr0dsz> BillCriswell: yes somehow indeed strange, the loader.js is really included after the library is included i shall check my html sources to be sure
[16:07:37] <rgenito> ah i see, i want to use .offset() to get the coordinates relative to the document... hehe
[16:07:42] <jarr0dsz> already did but can;t hurt
[16:09:11] <BrandonC> http://jsfiddle.net/mr8gj/51/
[16:09:14] <BillCriswell> jarr0dsz: Yeah, just hard to tell without looking at the code.
[16:09:15] <BrandonC> line height is missing px
[16:09:37] <jarr0dsz> the .js that assigns the function to certain divs is really *after the library itself
[16:09:56] <BillCriswell> BrandonC: Do width + 'px'
[16:10:49] <BillCriswell> BrandonC: http://jsfiddle.net/mr8gj/52/
[16:10:51] <BrandonC> thanks
[16:11:54] <BillCriswell> BrandonC: Welcoem.
[16:12:42] <jarr0dsz> hmmz seems that including jquery 2x in 2 different .js files that import other js is causing this
[16:18:52] <vectorized> Hey. right now I'm failing at figuring out why this code isnt working
[16:18:55] <vectorized> anyone around?
[16:18:57] <vectorized> interested?
[16:19:34] <BillCriswell> vectorized: Just ask. It's A O K.
[16:19:54] <vectorized> Cant get removeClass w/ addClass to work
[16:19:56] <vectorized> page:
[16:20:06] <vectorized> http://zdev.tumblr.com/
[16:20:32] <BillCriswell> vectorized: You didn't include jQuery it looks like.
[16:20:42] <vectorized> its shortly above it
[16:20:44] <vectorized> i beleive
[16:20:47] <vectorized> i thought i checked that one
[16:21:08] <BillCriswell> vectorized: Hmm.
[16:21:22] <tw2113>  <script href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>
[16:21:40] <vectorized> yuyp
[16:21:47] <vectorized> Line 410
[16:21:53] <BillCriswell> vectorized: Yeah, that's what's confusing me.
[16:21:56] <tw2113> i found that on line 845
[16:22:00] <vectorized> oh yeah
[16:22:06] <vectorized> generated dynamic code
[16:22:07] <vectorized> my bad
[16:22:13] <BillCriswell> The error is: Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[16:22:13] <vectorized> 410 before
[16:22:18] <vectorized> hmm
[16:22:34] <BillCriswell> No idea how that would happen with jQuery included.
[16:22:50] <BillCriswell> It says jQuery is not defined.
[16:23:05] <vectorized> i'm not good w/ JS, but that's odd
[16:23:19] <BillCriswell> vectorized: Duh.
[16:23:23] <BillCriswell> Took me a while to see it.
[16:23:31] <BillCriswell> You want src="..." not href="..."
[16:23:44] <vectorized> one sec
[16:24:19] <BillCriswell> In your script tags.
[16:24:40] <vectorized> possible
[16:24:48] <vectorized> hmm
[16:24:56] <BillCriswell> vectorized: It definitely is.
[16:25:08] <tw2113> return true
[16:25:10] <BillCriswell> <script src="..."></script> works
[16:25:21] <BillCriswell> <script href="..."></script> doesn.t
[16:25:28] <vectorized> apparently
[16:25:29] <clondike> darn html inconsistencies
[16:25:37] <tw2113> no apparently, definitely
[16:26:00] <vectorized> hell yes
[16:26:04] <vectorized> refresh. fixed
[16:26:05] <vectorized> thanks
[16:26:10] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[16:26:46] <vectorized> making tumblr better, one line of code at a time
[16:29:39] <lampe2> how can a resize something from bottom to top ?
[16:33:20] <clondike> lampe2: you probably have to use animate() with custom params
[16:33:33] <clondike> and i guess reduce the height while you increase the margin-top
[16:34:50] <lampe2> clondike, i got it :) with position relative in the parent div and position: absolute in the child div !
[16:36:38] <clondike> tres bien
[16:37:35] <Cabrera_2> Hi guys
[16:37:54] <Cabrera_2> someone know how to open a bootstrap model window? I'm trying $('#video').modal('show');  but doesn't shows
[16:37:54] <lampe2> this is strange....
[16:39:59] <lampe2> http://jsfiddle.net/zafc5/ so the things at first runs as it should! when i do the left slider it goes up and down but then when i drag it once on the east side of the white element the slider is broken !
[16:42:28] <lampe2> okay i know why cause jquery ui adds a top css tag ... how can i say jquery ui to not do this ?
[17:01:04] <shoky> lampe2: donno but you can just set top to 'auto' as well, in your slide callback
[17:02:35] <lampe2> shoky, $("#resizable").css("top",''); does the trick :)
[17:03:22] <shoky> you could combine it:  $('#resizable').css({top:'', height: ui.value})
[17:11:00] <lampe2> how can i make the space bigger to click on a resizeable object?
[17:12:18] <clondike> add padding to the element?
[17:13:38] <lampe2> clondike, padding dosent work :(
[17:16:34] <clondike> damn
[17:48:19] <shoky> lampe2: you can change the width/height of .ui-resizable-X
[17:48:28] <shoky> where X=e in your fiddle
[17:50:39] <DonCabrera> hi guys!
[17:50:52] <DonCabrera> I'm trying to load a bootstrap modal box at startup
[17:50:55] <DonCabrera> but it doens't loads
[17:50:59] <DonCabrera> $(document).ready(function() {  				$('#video').modal('show');  				 			});
[17:51:02] <DonCabrera> someone?
[17:51:03] <DonCabrera> please?
[17:51:40] <rgenito> :: reading ::
[17:52:08] <rgenito> i've never used modals. first place i would go to check is http://api.jquery.com/modal
[17:52:15] <rgenito> (or search modal on jquery.com if that link is not valid)
[17:52:24] <shoky> DonCabrera: i think you need to initialize the modal first
[17:52:32] <DonCabrera> ?
[17:52:36] <shoky> with .modal( options )
[17:53:03] <rgenito> is there a way with jquery to disable all link actions and form actions (button clicking, toggling, etc) inside of a certain div or on the document itself? :D
[17:54:20] <shoky> DonCabrera: maybe just $('#video').modal()
[17:56:10] <sinusss> how do I display [object HTMLImageElement] from the console?
[17:56:45] <shoky> what?
[17:57:31] <sinusss> right now when I console.log(var) i just get [object HTMLImageElement]  - how do I display the data inside the [object HTMLImageElement]? (sort of like a var_dump($array) for PHP)
[17:57:45] <DonCabrera> mmm
[17:57:45] <shoky> what browser are you using
[17:57:46] <DonCabrera> thanks guys
[17:57:53] <sinusss> chomr
[17:57:56] <sinusss> *chrome
[17:58:52] <shoky> sinusss you could try console.dir
[17:59:10] <sinusss> trying it out now..
[18:00:33] <sinusss> shoky I get [object HTMLImageElement] then a dropdown that says "No Properties"
[18:00:57] <shoky> what chrome ver?  and what exactly is in your variable?
[18:02:03] <shoky> sinusss: console.log(typeof var)  what does that give you
[18:02:18] <shoky> i'm guessing a string.
[18:02:54] <sinusss> shoky thanks https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/HTMLImageElement
[18:02:59] <shoky> ?
[18:03:11] <sinusss> I can get the src, etc.
[18:14:41] <goddard> im getting some strange error and i need some help debugging http://pastebin.com/wSiMsMUG
[18:15:50] <goddard> this is what im trying to get working http://redactorjs.com/docs/files/
[18:20:57] <shoky> goddard: what about some code
[18:26:20] <goddard> nvm i figured it out thanks though shoky
[18:26:25] <shoky> looks like maybe an error in your php , not outputting correct json
[18:26:28] <shoky> ah
[18:27:15] <Celene> I am currently having trouble with one of my jQuery scripts (http://pastebin.com/xRnrcqbR). Though I have added booleans to prevent the scroll listener from doing anything while the animation is occuring, yet it still fires at the scroll animation. I have already checked this over with jshint.
[18:28:17] <shoky> Celene: make a jsfiddle
[18:34:50] <rgenito> herro everyone :)
[18:34:58] <rgenito> i'm working on my first 'loading mask' ... any tips?
[18:34:58] <rgenito> http://jsfiddle.net/C9VFK/
[18:35:15] <Celene> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/K88AW/1/
[18:36:36] <Celene> If it doesn't work, I already have a dev site running the code.
[19:07:49] <decci> Hi Guys
[19:07:58] <decci> I need suggestion for designging stand-alone web page that will run off localhost web server. The page will talk to a backend script written in python that will drive the linux network manager over ibus (see http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/ ) The page will list available networks and allow the user to connect to one. The front end will use jquery-ui.
[19:21:23] <ibodi> i have a form to upload a.txt, onsubmit, i would like the txt into <div>..</div> -- what's best method  to keep page not move?
[19:46:39] <scrandaddy> is there a good reason not to develop a library with jquery as a dependency?
[19:48:10] <tw2113> you mean just straight javascript?
[19:48:39] <scrandaddy> yeah, "vanilla"
[19:48:55] <tw2113> the lack of depending on jquery would be a good reason
[19:49:27] <scrandaddy> well that's what i'm asking. how bad is that really? i like the idea but do other developers really care?
[19:50:02] <tw2113> it may be bad if someone only knows jquery and not javascript directly
[19:50:18] <tw2113> but if they know straight javascript, then there shouldn't be much issue
[19:51:18] <tw2113> imho
[19:51:46] <tw2113> the plugin would work everywhere, regardless of if the page loads jquery or not
[19:51:53] <tw2113> as long as javascript is enabled in the user's browser
[20:05:30] <scar> if i create a contact form using jquery-- how do i handle devices w/js disabled?
[20:05:42] <scar> old fashioned <noscript> ? lol
[20:07:24] <tw2113> you're using jquery to make the inputs?
[20:07:42] <scar> no to process the form, excuse me. tw2113 heh
[20:08:08] <scar> i mean the fact is very little have js disabled but it is a contact form-- haha
[20:08:34] <scar> i tried setting an action="" to the form but then the form posts to that url instead of the ajax (or maybe it refreshes b4 ajax finishes)
[20:08:51] <tw2113> list the email address as well and if they're that dedicated to email you, the 4 users with js disabled can use that
[20:09:02] <tw2113> or you could use noscript to state that js is required to process the form
[20:13:52] <scar> tw2113: is there a way to use jquery to prevent the form from being processed normally?
[20:14:02] <scar> ie, maybe just on page load remove the action="" via js? prob good
[20:14:16] <tw2113> why would you need to?
[20:15:23] <scar> bc when i hit submit if action is set, the form submits via post rather than jquery/ajax
[20:15:41] <tw2113> so it works even without jquery/ajax?
[20:15:44] <clondike> ?preventDefault
[20:15:45] <Guest3103> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[20:15:57] <clondike> hello Guest3103
[20:15:57] <Guest3103> clondike, :)
[20:16:50] <scar> tw2113: well, if i create a normal basic html form that submits without jquery-- then i create jquery to submit it (the action is there for non-js), well the normal form overrides-- maybe clondike's solution is viable (or mabe .attr('action', false) ??) -- perhaps i asked the wrong question heh
[20:17:32] <tw2113> i'm trying to get your workflow figured out
[20:17:54] <scar> okay, well, think about a BASIC html form that submits name, email, comments
[20:17:59] <clondike> scar: this is probably the kind of thing you are after http://dannybaggs.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/progressive-enhancement-via-ajax/
[20:18:03] <tw2113> yeah, it works without js
[20:18:03] <scar> BASIC <form action="/mail.php" method="post">
[20:18:05] <pranavrc> Hi. On clicking the submit button to a form, I run a function that sends 8 ajax requests sequentially. I'm doing this because the server takes some time to process the form data, so I'm having it send the data back in chunks, and every time the response is received, I'm appending it to a div. Again, this happens when the user fills out the input box and clicks on submit. I want to be able to do the same thing just by typing out the url in the br
[20:18:06] <pranavrc> owser and sending a GET request, such as ?input=foo. That is, on sending the get request with the form data, I want the page to be retrieved, AND the sequential ajax function to be run, so that I get the same result as manually filling out the form. Is this possible?
[20:18:40] <scar> tw2113: well, even if i add Jquery to the submit button-- the form still submits AS IF NO JQUERY EXISTED--- i see my jquery start to go, but once i hit submit, the form submits AS IF NO JQUERY _AND_ the jquery begins lol
[20:19:07] <tw2113> so jquery/js is not needed at all technically
[20:19:08] <scar> tw2113: so basically my jquery is useless unless i remove action="" -- so possibly use jquery to remove the action="" _OR_ use preventDefault() ?
[20:19:35] <scar> tw2113: technically, but i want the form to process w/o refresh and to have a nice fade in and out "form submitted" or hwatever-- or whatever fancy thing i want to do lol
[20:19:36] <scar> whatever*
[20:19:37] <clondike> preventDefault!
[20:20:12] <scar> clondike: curious why $('#myform').preventDefault() vs $('#myform').attr('action', false) -- just curious?
[20:20:18] <tw2113> sounds like you could do it in a click event handl
[20:20:19] <tw2113> e
[20:20:36] <scar> tw2113: i mean,  is it common to NOT use action="" on a jquery form?
[20:20:36] <scar> lol
[20:20:56] <tw2113> $('submit').on('click',function(e) { e.preventDefault(); //handle ajax at this point }
[20:21:04] <clondike> scar: preventDefault is more idiomatic
[20:21:11] <scar> clondike: ahh, such as tw2113's example
[20:21:16] <clondike> if i read that i would be like "oh he is preventing the form submission"
[20:21:25] <scar> heh
[20:21:27] <clondike> if i saw the code was messing with the action attr i would have to work out why
[20:21:33] <scar> ahhh
[20:21:34] <scar> i get ya
[20:21:45] <scar> sort of like a wrapper func for catch-all, rather than a specific
[20:21:59] <tw2113> i'd probably be more specific with the submit selector
[20:22:02] <scar> so preventDefault() on ALL $('a') would make ALL LINKS _unclickable_ ?
[20:22:04] <tw2113> tie it to a specific ID
[20:22:22] <tw2113> yeah, that'd ruin your clicking
[20:22:33] <scar> just understanding the concept :)
[20:22:48] <scar> the lightbulb finally went off with jquery for me this past week, and im just in heaven haha.
[20:23:03] <clondike> aw
[20:23:04] <scar> bc i always got hung up on the ajax for some reason now i wonder why the heck i didnt get it
[20:23:05] <scar> hahaha
[20:23:16] <scar> well, i never had to use jquery much except nivo and plugins
[20:23:25] <scar> i used for basic stuff sparingly
[20:23:39] <scar> now that i see how inheritantly easy it is, it just opens the doors hah
[20:23:41] <tw2113> now you can start looking at jquery plugin code
[20:23:45] <scar> yeah
[20:23:46] <tw2113> and start analyzing
[20:23:47] <scar> exactly :)
[20:24:02] <scar> here's my first jquery/ajax :
[20:24:17] <scar> http://ulg.alomedia.net/product/sinatra/
[20:24:19] <scar> its a product page
[20:24:29] <scar> add the item to your cart, itll add dynamically and update your cart total @ top right w/ fade in fade out
[20:24:50] <scar> hah i was pretty stoked and realized how pathetic it was to learn how easy it is to do what i did at the url above... lol
[20:24:57] <scar> i felt pretty dubm
[20:25:22] <tw2113> meh, not dumb, just not yet educated
[20:25:48] <scar> true, i know that. im just jokin around lol
[20:25:59] <scar> its bc i never _needed_ to know it i suppose.
[20:26:57] <clondike> i never needed to know the early history of monasticism
[20:27:03] <clondike> but that isn't stopping me
[20:27:09] <tw2113> and now your a doctor on it clondike ?
[20:27:18] <clondike> we'll see
[20:27:23] <tw2113> ah, just phd
[20:27:26] <tw2113> loser
[20:27:27] <tw2113> :D
[20:27:37] <tw2113> wait, that's the same
[20:27:38] <tw2113> shit
[20:28:08] <scar> hm
[20:28:57] <scar> with auto scroll-loaders, where you scroll the page and it loads more content as you scroll-- is there some native jquery way to handle scrolling or is it done by pixels in height?
[20:29:10] <scar> or too complicated for that specific description?
[20:29:16] <clondike> ?scroll
[20:29:16] <Guest3103> .scroll(handler): Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/scroll/
[20:29:39] <tw2113> i think scar means masonry and infinite scroll
[20:30:09] <scar> OH you know what?! i always have played with the standard jquery plugins w/ UI, and never figurd out how to use the dang progress bar.
[20:30:16] <scar> every example i see doesnt actually show it binded to an event lol
[20:30:21] <scar> anyone know of a good url or example?
[20:31:34] <scar> function(event, ui)
[20:31:44] <scar> can i just type event, ui ? or are those vars i create?
[20:32:42] <scar> i imagine event i can, bc i see function(e) all the tiem
[20:33:20] <scar> i've used it to set specific values like steps in a form
[20:33:23] <scar> oh well ill play :)
[20:36:30] <TiffanyAmber> hi people
[20:36:40] <TiffanyAmber> someone knows how to fade a background with js
[20:38:43] <scar> TiffanyAmber: fade the color or image?
[20:39:25] <clondike> TiffanyAmber: http://www.mightymeta.co.uk/animating-opacity-of-background-image-in-jquery-without-affecting-child-elements/
[20:41:50] <TiffanyAmber> image image
[20:43:30] <TiffanyAmber> mmm I want it over time
[20:43:35] <TiffanyAmber> like 4 secs
[20:43:36] <TiffanyAmber> and cycle
[20:43:59] <b0x> animate?
[20:46:53] <clondike> fiat
[20:47:26] <TiffanyAmber> mmm
[20:47:29] <TiffanyAmber> no css3
[20:47:33] <TiffanyAmber> has to work with ie too
[20:48:51] <TiffanyAmber> and it is the body image
[22:18:04] <Jagan> $('input[type="text"]:visible:first').focus(),  is not focusing the first field.   what is the Issue can anyone help me?
[22:19:20] <clondike> Jagan: test the selector first by running it at the console of your debugger. does it match the right element?
[22:21:58] <Jagan> Its matching the element but its not focusing
[22:22:45] <clondike> it might be that focus() only calls the focus event handler
[22:22:57] <clondike> rather than actually focus anything
[22:23:08] <clondike> try $('input[type="text"]:visible:first')[0].focus()
[22:23:59] <Jagan> No. this is also not working
[22:24:28] <clondike> hmm
[22:24:37] <Jagan> Is there any method other than foucs()
[22:25:13] <clondike> it works for me here http://jsfiddle.net/fWW5p/
[22:28:22] <Jagan> ya .. but its not working for me.. I will check
[22:35:51] <clondike> Jagan: you sure there isn't something else stealing the focus?
[22:40:59] <clondike> tabindex?
[22:42:20] <danheberden> does focus work if you call the native method?
[22:42:32] <danheberden> $yourjQueryObject[0].focus()
[23:03:46] <chovy> what does .ajax({ error: function(??) } args are passed?
[23:04:08] <chovy> i have a data object being sent along with error, but not sure how to get it.
[23:08:49] <chovy> complete: function(d){ d.foo works } but error: function(d) { d.foo does not }
[23:10:27] <clondike> chovy: error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[23:10:51] <clondike> via http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[23:12:16] <chovy> yeah
[23:12:23] <chovy> how do i pass a message from the backend then.
[23:12:31] <chovy> I thought i could output a json object
[23:12:38] <chovy> but seems I cannot get at it this way
[23:12:48] <chovy> should i just return 200 and status of error?
[23:12:58] <clondike> yes that's what i'd do
[23:13:02] <clondike> it's not an ajax error
[23:13:08] <clondike> the ajax is successful
[23:13:10] <clondike> but it returns the error
[23:13:12] <chovy> res.json(200, { status: 'error', message: "You don't have permission"});
[23:13:16] <clondike> for jQuery to do something with
[23:13:24] <clondike> right
[23:13:30] <clondike> looks good to me
[23:13:38] <chord> down with apple, android will win
[23:13:42] <chovy> i was doing res.json(401, { status: 'error', message: "You don't have permission"});
[23:13:52] <chovy> maybe that's a misuse of 401
[23:14:34] <clondike> yes, the error refers to something going wrong on the network, usually
[23:14:37] <clondike> this is an internal error
[23:14:44] <clondike> which you want to return successfully 200 OK
[23:15:54] <chovy> ok
[23:15:56] <chovy> cool
[23:28:04] <anli> I have lost the link to the webpage that describes how to implmenent onchange on input[type=file] for internet explorer
[23:28:25] <anli> Ah, got it now
[23:32:11] <zsoc> hm... so i can user .hover().click() to control element->hover->click relationships? that's really cool if that's how that works.
[23:43:04] <buu> Does anyone know if jqplot line graphs can be convinced to show the axis labels on the right side instead of the left?
[23:45:22] <Milos> How can I select all elements of type X *AFTER* a certain element in the code, systematically?
[23:46:39] <Milos> :gt()?
[23:53:21] <chord> so you all apple fanboys with your iphone 5
[23:54:43] <tw2113> 4s and no fanboy
[23:55:07] <tw2113> i have no reason to go to the 5 when i just got this thing in April
