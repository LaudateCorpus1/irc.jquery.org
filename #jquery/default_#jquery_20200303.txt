[17:04:34] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:44:39] <Cork> robertmaxrees: did you see the weird global notice?'sent about 13 hours ago?
[23:45:19] <Gudddu> What is wrong with this jquery selector?\
[23:45:20] <Gudddu> $('.ui copy icon button')
[23:45:50] <robertmaxrees> what are 'copy' and 'icon' supposed to be?
[23:46:03] <Gudddu> <button id = "copy_json" class="ui copy icon button"><i class="copy icon"></i></button>
[23:46:19] <robertmaxrees> well, 2 things: 1 - just use the ID.
[23:46:29] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, I definitely have a button with this class in my source as seen using view source.
[23:47:11] <robertmaxrees> actually, 1 thing - just select using the ID :)
[23:47:21] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, The thing is that I need a script to copy the data into clipboard. So i wrote a code like this http://dpaste.com/1DP6Z5G
[23:47:41] <robertmaxrees> sure - but why not select on the ID?
[23:47:41] <Gudddu> I fi use code, I will need to copy that code N times over and N is indeterminate at the moment.
[23:48:06] <robertmaxrees> so that button will be on the page multiple times
[23:48:07] <Gudddu> I am putting in a button on every row of a table to select data from that particular row of the table.
[23:48:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[23:48:12] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, Yes.
[23:48:15] <robertmaxrees> then you need to remove the ID, for starters.
[23:48:23] <robertmaxrees> you cannot repeat an ID on a page.
[23:48:36] <Gudddu> I can assign a unique code to each buttton but I am not sure how to attach the copy to clickboard code to each.
[23:48:54] <robertmaxrees> okay - just make sure you fix that part first since repeating an ID is invalid.
[23:49:03] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, I will remove the id. That is quick,
[23:49:13] <robertmaxrees> for selecting the button, you actually want '.ui.copy.icon'
[23:49:29] <robertmaxrees> if you absolutely need to use the button tag as part of that selector, then you want 'button.ui.copy.icon'
[23:49:58] <robertmaxrees> but the best choice here instead is to come with with a descriptive, semantic class, like copy_button and select using that instead.
[23:50:40] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, is 'button.ui.copy.icon' same as 'ui.copy.icon.button' ?
[23:50:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[23:51:12] <robertmaxrees> the tag has to be the first one if you want to select like that.
[23:51:27] <robertmaxrees> ui.copy.icon.button is a <ui> element with the classes copy, icon, and button./
[23:51:41] <Gudddu> I always thought that For <button class="ui copy icon button"><i class="copy icon"></i></button> it should be 'ui.copy.icon.button
[23:51:43] <robertmaxrees> any time a part of a selector starts with a '.', it's a class.
[23:51:47] <Gudddu> Thanks for clearing this for me robertmaxrees
[23:52:07] <robertmaxrees> if you have a tagname, it can't start with . or #, so it has to be the start of the selector
[23:52:18] <robertmaxrees> but avoid tag selectors like that when possible.
[23:53:13] <Gudddu> For <button class="ui copy icon button"><i class="copy icon"></i></button> both 'button.ui.copy.icon' and 'button.ui.copy.icon.button' are good right?
[23:53:28] <Gudddu> Although the second one is redundant in its selection.
[23:53:32] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[23:53:44] <robertmaxrees> the second one is using button for both a classname and a tagname, which doesn't make any sense
[23:53:52] <robertmaxrees> that's like doing <div class="div>
[23:54:03] <robertmaxrees> err, <div class="div">
[23:54:06] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :)
[23:54:12] <robertmaxrees> use proper classnames instead.
[23:54:25] <robertmaxrees> <button class="copy_text">
[23:54:33] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, I got it from https://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html
[23:55:11] <robertmaxrees> nobody said you can't include semantic classnames to describe behavior.
[23:55:15] <robertmaxrees> and, indeed, you should.
[23:55:36] <robertmaxrees> decouples your css and js.
[23:55:40] <robertmaxrees> which is always a good idea.
[23:57:48] <Gudddu> $('.ui.copy.icon')
[23:57:54] <robertmaxrees> :(
[23:58:22] <Gudddu> This one works.
[23:58:32] <robertmaxrees> it's not a good idea but okie.
[23:59:29] <Gudddu> robertmaxrees, Can i put any class name xyz even if it is not a class for easy identifying?
[23:59:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
