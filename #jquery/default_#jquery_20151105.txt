[01:21:31] <xybrek> Anyone knows a jquery plugin to stack panels? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33537877/jquery-plugin-for-stacking-panels
[02:11:08] <anli> Is the developer tools "elements" tab accessible via script?
[02:11:15] <anli> If I want to select a certain node for instance
[02:29:49] <Cork> anli: you would have to ask that in a support channel for the browser your using
[02:31:05] <anli> Oh, one of those
[02:32:39] <anli> Do you have any special one in mind?
[02:32:49] <anli> :)
[02:33:19] <Cork> my point is your question depends on the browser, also it is off topic of this channel
[02:38:33] <hellyeah> yo
[03:19:38] <anli> It is off-topic in any channel, but the point is taken
[03:51:17] <sanct> Hi, I'd like to bind an chage listener to the "window.getSelection().isCollapsed".  Is there a way to do this with jquery?
[03:51:50] <Cork> sanct: that is a method not a dom element
[03:51:57] <Cork> so no there are no events to bind to
[03:52:56] <sanct> no way to trigger a function whenever that property is changed?
[03:53:05] <Cork> no
[03:53:25] <Cork> you can overload the function if it has a prototype
[03:53:33] <Cork> and call things from the replacement function
[03:53:41] <Cork> but i don't think getSelection has a prototype
[03:54:06] <Cork> actually
[03:54:09] <Cork> that wouldn't work anyway
[03:54:15] <Cork> cause the value isn't changed by javascript
[03:54:36] <sanct> ahh ok.  thanks
[04:59:13] <longman> Hey
[05:05:42] <theRealAlexz> How can I wrap a .one-method around this function? http://pastebin.com/ChypPK4N
[05:06:17] <Cork> around what function?
[05:06:32] <Cork> the anonymous function you pass to setTimeout?
[05:08:58] <theRealAlexz> yes Cork
[05:09:05] <theRealAlexz> or maybe more specifically dataLayer.push({"event": "logged-in"});
[05:09:36] <Cork> .one is an event handler that when it fires removes it self
[05:09:42] <Cork> you can't use it for any of those
[05:10:47] <theRealAlexz> aww
[05:55:35] <Tennis> Hey I'm trying to get a div inside a div inside a td

[05:57:12] <Tennis> $(".icon-upload").closest('tr').children('td.hrns').html();
[05:57:26] <Tennis> the closest i seem to be able to get is the entire td's html contents
[05:58:16] <Tennis> its a bit ropey as is at the moment i get the entire td and trim off all the divs and stuff i dont need
[05:59:24] <Tennis> could anyone tell me if i could ammend my selector to achieve this
[05:59:52] <Tennis> or can .children() only take one selector or
[06:08:53] <Tennis> thanks for the rubber duck debugging
[06:09:00] <Tennis> solved it :) , ignore me!
[06:09:15] <Tennis> .find() was my friend

[06:42:02] <minhthai> Hi every body, I have a problem about Retry-After when server response 503. How can setup web for retry send ajax to server after time
[06:42:56] <minhthai> and we can retry send ajax to server with Retry-After on header or not ?
[06:43:06] <minhthai> please help me
[06:43:09] <minhthai> thank all
[08:12:30] <xinming> In jquery, Is it possible to do a closest search within the specified root?
[08:12:55] <taplar> sure
[08:13:32] <xinming> For example, dom1 contains x[x1,x2,x3] y[y1, y2, y3] z[z1,z2,z3],   and x1 and y1 may both have the same attribute.
[08:14:21] <xinming> But I want to use closest in x1 to search "up", something above dom1 may have same attributes. So, How can we achieve this?
[08:15:04] <taplar> your syntax is strange.  you mean <x><x1></x1><x2></x2>...</x> ?
[08:15:27] <xinming> yes, something like that. Why I don't use html is it's a bit tedious and not channel friendly to read.
[08:16:04] <taplar> you can do closest() off of x1 trying to find it's parent
[08:16:31] <taplar> if your wanting to find the closest with a matching attribute, you might have to give it a custom function to do the match logic
[08:16:32] <xinming> so, I need 2 steps.
[08:16:57] <xinming> Ok, it can be done in a single step.
[08:17:06] <xinming> I thought it can be done in a single step.
[08:19:54] <Cork> xinming: are you searching in dom or in an array?
[08:20:04] <Cork> your example sounds more like an array search then dom
[08:22:07] <xinming> Cork: Nope, not array.
[08:22:13] <xinming> sorry for my poor example.
[08:24:38] <xinming> <div> <x> <x1/> <x1/> <x1/> </x>  <y> <y1/> <y1/> <y1/> </y </div>     <-- In this case, I am in x1 (or maybe it's children), and I want to get the closest element which has specific attribute. But within the top-level div. Because y may have the same attribute.
[08:25:09] <Cork> xinming: make a jsfiddle
[08:25:18] <xinming> Ok. bbl
[08:25:25] <Cork> html isn't funny to read in irc :)
[08:25:42] <xinming> Yes, that's why I use strange html example.
[08:25:56] <taplar> and you put things in array syntax, we're going to think in terms of arrays, :)
[08:26:36] <Cork> the reason for my original question is i've actually had to solve close to what you asked
[08:26:40] <Cork> for numbers in an array
[08:26:50] <Cork> "find the number closest to x in the array"
[08:28:10] <rthtsjsry> Hi all, I'm trying to make a google maps-esque draggable item (an SVG element that is around twice as large as the containing div) I was to be able to drag the div around within div, without allowing any of the background of the div to show. If I use .draggable({containment: 'parent'}), the SVG snaps to the edge of the div, presumably because it do
[08:28:11] <rthtsjsry> esn't like that the SVG overflows. Any ideas how I can get round this?
[08:28:15] <xinming> But it's not array, That's why I found it's confusing.
[08:28:20] <xinming> http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/   <--
[08:28:21] <xinming> Here
[08:28:48] <Cork> and you want to find the data-test?
[08:29:14] <taplar> i thought you said 'that have a matching attribute'?
[08:29:22] <xinming> I've mark where I am, And I want to search up to the closest element wether there is elements contains data-text="xyz"
[08:29:27] <xinming> But in my example html, It doesn't
[08:29:46] <xinming> So, If I search down in #root
[08:29:47] <Cork> xinming: that you have multi levels makes that a lot harder
[08:30:09] <xinming> I may found data-text="xyz", But the node is not what I want.
[08:30:12] <Cork> cause there isn't really an easy way to find "closest" in that makrup
[08:30:14] <taplar> how are you defining 'up to closest element' ?
[08:30:28] <xinming> taplar: The root is #root
[08:30:32] <Cork> (better make the example more complete)
[08:30:38] <xinming> hmm, Ok.
[08:30:49] <Cork> have the duplicate entires
[08:30:58] <Cork> so we can see what needs to be avoided
[08:31:20] <rthtsjsry> Example of above: http://jsfiddle.net/jflw/03z8m0ax/
[08:31:22] <Cork> also i would make the root a class
[08:31:26] <Cork> else it can't be repeated
[08:37:43] <xinming> http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/
[08:38:08] <xinming> http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/1/
[08:38:15] <xinming> I need to click update, sorry
[08:39:39] <taplar> so your looking for siblings with the same attribute
[08:39:53] <Cork> not siblings
[08:40:38] <hellyeah> yo
[08:40:40] <taplar> well in his comment it says root2 wouldn't find anything, but the first would.  the difference looks like root2 doesn't have a matching sibling
[08:40:50] <taplar> root1 does
[08:41:18] <xinming> yes.
[08:41:26] <hellyeah> i have a div when you click the button i will enlarge it and click it again i will narrow it
[08:41:40] <hellyeah> changew width of div when you click the button seems logical?
[08:41:46] <xinming> But all searches are limited to the top level div.
[08:42:22] <taplar> so i'm confused.  you don't want an element in root2 to find a 'closest' in root1?
[08:42:36] <Cork> xinming: i'm not really following what in this isn't what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/2/
[08:42:38] <xinming> I can have the top level div, and try to do something like  $('#top-level').find('[data-text=xyz]');  <-- But this would found the node in root2
[08:43:04] <taplar> xinming: you can do a .not() to filter out your starting element
[08:43:48] <taplar> hellyeah: changing element dimensions on an event is fine
[08:43:57] <xinming> Cork: Nope.
[08:44:03] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[08:44:07] <Cork> xinming: that was a question :)
[08:44:13] <Cork> "what in it isn't what you want"
[08:44:17] <hellyeah> but when you click it again i need to make it as it is used to be
[08:44:22] <Cork> cause your text point at this as the solution
[08:44:24] <taplar> hellyeah: use a class
[08:44:25] <hellyeah> two click events respectively
[08:44:28] <taplar> add and remove the class
[08:44:34] <hellyeah> ah
[08:44:37] <hellyeah> toggleClass
[08:44:55] <hellyeah> i can do it with toggleClass right
[08:45:00] <taplar> sure
[08:45:02] <hellyeah> lemme fiddle
[08:45:28] <Cork> xinming: this is an alternative http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/3/
[08:45:43] <Cork> but again, the problem isn't explained too well
[08:45:55] <xinming> Yes, I'll check again.
[08:48:48] <rthtsjsry> Any ideas on ^^, peeps?
[08:49:23] <hellyeah> i suppose wrap method must show button inside the territoy https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/5/ am i wrong?
[08:50:08] <xinming> I hope this time, my question can now be clear.
[08:50:11] <xinming> http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/5/
[08:51:07] <Cork> uh...
[08:51:17] <Cork> xinming: that is what the code i gave you before does
[08:51:48] <Cork> xinming: http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/6/
[08:52:02] <Cork> check the console
[08:52:37] <Cork> opps
[08:52:41] <Cork> except there is error in it
[08:53:48] <xinming> Did you see that I removed the data-text in the root of #start2?
[08:53:59] <Cork> that wasn't what i was talking about
[08:54:07] <Cork> i had an error in my second selector
[08:54:10] <Cork> give me a min
[08:55:43] <Cork> there we go
[08:55:45] <Cork> xinming: http://jsfiddle.net/vkyn5s57/8/
[08:56:06] <hellyeah> click event not working :/
[08:56:55] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/10/
[08:57:08] <hellyeah> ops
[08:57:27] <taplar> missing your '.'s
[08:57:31] <hellyeah> yeah
[08:57:34] <hellyeah> realized that
[08:57:40] <hellyeah> but not wortking again? https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/11/
[08:57:54] <Xatenev> hellyeah: because ur still missing a .
[08:57:59] <Xatenev> before buttonClass ._.
[08:58:00] <hellyeah> damn
[08:58:09] <hellyeah> sorry
[08:58:11] <hellyeah> puhahaha
[08:58:18] <hellyeah> why js didnt tell me about this
[08:58:24] <taplar> not an error
[08:58:30] <Xatenev> it searches for an element called buttonClass like that
[08:58:31] <taplar> your selector just didn't match anything
[08:58:33] <Xatenev> which could exist
[08:58:48] <hellyeah> okey
[08:58:54] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[08:59:08] <hellyeah> i dont know how i can miss this, small thingy
[08:59:24] <hellyeah> here it is
[08:59:25] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/13/
[08:59:50] <hellyeah> i just need to put this button left hand side and buttom of the div
[09:00:00] <taplar> uh, what's with the wrap?
[09:00:28] <zlude> Hello! I want to random two strings "dog and cat" sometimes appears "dog" sometimes "cat" what is the best way to do that?
[09:00:46] <hellyeah> i read wrap is for containing html element inside a div
[09:01:03] <hellyeah> actually i watched the vid
[09:01:05] <taplar> right, but in this case your wrapping it with an existing element
[09:01:13] <taplar> why not have your html start out like that already
[09:01:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:01:51] <hellyeah> i just wonder wrap
[09:01:57] <hellyeah> seems interesting to me
[09:02:01] <taplar> don't make js do everything
[09:02:22] <hellyeah> dont make js do everything? why?
[09:02:32] <taplar> because that's not its responsibility
[09:02:38] <hellyeah> any spesific reason?
[09:02:42] <hellyeah> ic
[09:02:49] <taplar> it's the markups responsibility to start out in an expected manner
[09:02:49] <hellyeah> why wrap exist then?
[09:02:56] <taplar> for dynamic cases
[09:03:02] <hellyeah> ic
[09:03:09] <taplar> if something is always going to be a certain way, make it default that way
[09:03:27] <taplar> same goes for css
[09:03:36] <hellyeah> i wont use wrap then
[09:04:19] <hellyeah> using wrap make div bigger then it must be
[09:04:24] <Cork> zlude: (['cat', 'dog'])[Math.random() * 2]
[09:04:42] <taplar> your using the class to do that against the div
[09:04:50] <Cork> opps forgot floor
[09:05:07] <hellyeah> okey position:fixed do the same thing here https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/15/
[09:05:17] <taplar> wouldn't it be % 2 + 1?
[09:05:27] <taplar> err, no
[09:05:31] <hellyeah> 1 tequile two tequile three tequile hit the floor
[09:05:32] <taplar> just % 2
[09:05:46] <Cork> zlude: (['cat', 'dog'])[Math.round(Math.random() * 2)]
[09:05:59] <hellyeah> i guess i need to calculate page width
[09:06:11] <zlude> Cork: thank you!
[09:06:15] <hellyeah> and have to set territory width according to page width
[09:06:19] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[09:06:29] <Cork> zlude: you most likely want to store the array in a variable though :()
[09:06:37] <hellyeah> :o
[09:06:37] <Cork> and not create it every time ^^
[09:06:37] <taplar> hellyeah: you can set the width to 100%
[09:07:57] <hellyeah> hmm actually i said wrongly
[09:08:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2kck87/20/
[09:08:05] <hellyeah> i need to calculate height
[09:08:11] <hellyeah> according to page's height
[09:08:32] <Cork> zlude: actually you want to use Math.floor not Math.round, or you will get a third option match from time to time
[09:08:52] <hellyeah> height:100% not working

[10:36:06] <NoiseEee> krfa: whatever selector you like
[10:36:18] <NoiseEee> $('div.someClassThatIdentifiesWhatYouNeed')
[10:36:22] <NoiseEee> or similar
[10:37:10] <krfa> Thx but the problem it's that all my element are initialize with the same way. Based on the ID
[10:56:56] <NoiseEee> krfa: but uh wasn't your question "how to initialize without knowign the id"
[10:56:56] <skullcrasher> how can I select multiple inputs of different type
[10:57:37] <skullcrasher> like $('#asdf input[type=number || type=text || type=search]')
[10:57:45] <krfa> Yep, sorry, it wasn't clear
[10:58:15] <NoiseEee> krfa: so you can choose to initialize without knowing the ID
[10:58:30] <NoiseEee> krfa: if your question is "how can I initialize by ID without knowing the ID", well, uh, you can't
[10:58:41] <NoiseEee> "how do I eat this waffle without eating this waffle"
[10:59:15] <oddvar> easy: eat it and vom it back up again
[11:01:34] <krfa> Ok. I clarify my question. I've a page with multiple dynamically id which are initialize for bootstrap-table, for exemple. What I'd to do, is to set a property to these objects, whithout knowning there ID, but for exemple, by getting all the object having the method bootstrapTable

[11:06:45] <lemondom> hi
[11:07:21] <lemondom> is there a jquery plugin that just adds "scrolled" class to html element when the user scrolled down (even just 1px )?
[11:07:46] <lemondom> I could write one by myself, but as this is required for styling position:f ixed; conditionally on scrolling (I don't mean position: sticky; this is not the case here), I guess there is already such a thing?
[11:07:56] <lemondom> anyway,I looked out for it, but I guess I use the wrong search keywords?

[12:31:12] <taplar_food> change2 is undefined
[12:31:49] <rindolf> chingyy938: you need $("#change2").
[12:31:58] <rindolf> chingyy938: and you're not using jQuery.

[12:51:58] <royalty> for sure
[12:52:10] <Forbidd3n> what about not visible
[12:52:14] <Forbidd3n> the opposite

[13:23:12] <bojanlazic> Isn't that the fastest way to see what's actually going on?
[13:23:20] <robertmaxrees> a minimal test case is.
[13:23:22] <robertmaxrees> not the entire site.
[13:23:52] <NoiseEee> "A minimal test case should contain precisely the HTML and JavaScript necessary to demonstrate the problem, no more and no less. If the JavaScript is more than 42 lines, it is probably not a minimal test case."

[15:42:39] <NoiseEee> for one, .bind() is super-outdated
[15:43:20] <NoiseEee> chingyy938: but using "DOMSubtreeModified" at all is.... uncomon

[15:44:12] <chingyy938> 	$(".stock-block2").toggleClass("your-animation");
[15:44:16] <chingyy938> i changed it to toggle and it works
[15:44:38] <chingyy938> I don't know how to code, only copy paste and poking around :(
[16:01:31] <phelix> Would someone please take a look at this. http://pastie.org/10532823 I am using a mouseenter event to add a class but it seems that the function I am using to remove the class by clicking doesn't seem to see this class that has been added.
[16:01:56] <robertmaxrees> right.
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> event bindings only run against whatever exists at the time of binding.
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> they don't magically update
[16:02:31] <robertmaxrees> though this looks like angular, so i'd ask in a channel about that.
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> #angularjs would be where to go.
[16:07:21] <Azrael_-> i hate writing tons of lines just for connecting a bunch of input boxes together and react onto every change :)
[16:08:28] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't require much work.
[16:08:32] <robertmaxrees> maybe one event listener?
[16:08:57] <phelix> hmm ok
[16:09:22] <Azrael_-> or was this meant for me? :)
[16:09:32] <robertmaxrees> the second batch of messages.
[16:09:55] <robertmaxrees> phelix head to ##angularjs - you want a delgated listener for the class you're adding/removing.
[16:09:57] * Azrael_- admits being confused
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- you shouldn't need to write "tons of lines" - your setup should take like one event listenewr.
[16:10:33] <phelix> robertmaxrees: ok I'll try asking in there. Thanks, not quite sure how I would go about doing that.
[16:10:51] <Azrael_-> ah, ok. unfortunately i need a different behaviour depending on what box triggered the change
[16:10:52] <robertmaxrees> phelix hence why i'm suggesting you go there ;) not sure how angular wires all of that up.
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> Azrael_- why?
[16:11:34] <Azrael_-> because i have e.g. 3 boxes connected like this: box1 * box2 = box3  if the users changes one value i have to update one of the others
[16:11:47] <robertmaxrees> right, why does it matter where the event emitted from?
[16:12:28] <Azrael_-> because if the user can also change box3 and then i have to calculate and update box2 to show the correct value
[16:12:45] <Azrael_-> -if
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> but they're all updating.
[16:12:56] <robertmaxrees> still one listener.
[16:13:34] <Azrael_-> but i'd still need a switch to see what box triggered the change
[16:13:50] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:14:04] <robertmaxrees> if one updates the other two need to update, right?
[16:14:20] <Azrael_-> change box1 -> update box3, change box2 -> update box3, change box3 -> update box2
[16:14:31] <Azrael_-> no, only one needs to update
[16:14:34] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you could do one binding for this :)
[16:15:23] <Azrael_-> i could do it with one binding, but then i'd still need to check the event-source
[16:15:33] <robertmaxrees> something tells me you don't, but okay :D
[16:15:49] <Azrael_-> currently i don't see it :)
[17:11:55] <libracious> has any1 here taken eudyptula challendge?

[17:54:57] <fortiffied> $("#channel").ask("How are people?");
[17:55:26] <robertmaxrees> fortiffied TypeError
[17:55:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:55:50] <fortiffied> how?
[17:56:02] <robertmaxrees> "ask is not a function"
[17:56:06] <robertmaxrees> D:
[17:56:10] <fortiffied> It is now.
[18:15:49] <bobloblaw2> is there an easy way to get a url paramater ( http://www.site.com/page.html?value ) using jquery?
[18:15:54] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:16:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't touch the url.
[18:16:42] <ashgotti> Evening everyone. Dump question but how can I make a .each() re-usable function? I tried var foo = bar.each(function(){}); and then I call foo; but it doesn't seem to fire.
[18:16:54] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:17:01] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you're trying to do with it.
[18:17:24] <robertmaxrees> generally you make the function passed to the .each() reusable.
[18:17:38] <ashgotti> ah that makes sense
[18:17:54] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can make a function that calls foo.each();
[18:17:59] <robertmaxrees> but it really depends.
[18:18:31] <ashgotti> oh is that how I call it? I just call it using foo;
[18:18:39] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[18:18:43] <robertmaxrees> *show me the actual code.
[18:19:12] <ashgotti> http://jsfiddle.net/a1d0y1nx/
[18:19:56] <robertmaxrees> right, so cloneAddress there is being set to the return of addresses.each();
[18:19:57] <ashgotti> it's ugly, I'm working with Drupal and ajax
[18:20:05] <robertmaxrees> which is addresses
[18:20:20] <bobloblaw2> https://www.change.org/p/freenode-staff-stop-rampant-op-abuse-in-magento
[18:20:30] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees: So it should work how I want then
[18:20:38] <robertmaxrees> bobloblaw2 uh, what?
[18:20:41] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti no.
[18:20:44] <ashgotti> oh
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> because it's just like doing var cloneAddress = addresses;
[18:21:20] <ashgotti> ah, it doesn't include the .each and its function?
[18:21:43] <robertmaxrees> ashgotti it "includes" them inasmuch as the return value for .each() is the collection passed to it.
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> but it doesn't store the function anywhere.
[18:22:16] <robertmaxrees> though this code is... fragile.
[18:22:24] <robertmaxrees> it's not doing what you think it is.
[18:22:35] <ashgotti> ya seems like it
[18:22:53] <robertmaxrees> if (addressCount > addressCount2) { only takes into account the last thing the .each() ran over.
[18:23:55] <robertmaxrees> bobloblaw2 you can get the document.location.search
[18:24:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can use something like http://stevenbenner.com/2010/03/javascript-regex-trick-parse-a-query-string-into-an-object/
[18:24:25] <bobloblaw2> hmm will do
[18:24:34] <robertmaxrees> also: did you mean to drop that link in here?
[18:24:40] <robertmaxrees> or are you just spamming channels?
[18:25:11] <ashgotti> robertmaxrees++
[18:25:16] <ashgotti> Thanks for the help tonight
[18:25:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.
