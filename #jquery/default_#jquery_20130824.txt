[00:38:09] <doug65536> does anyone know why this matrix3d is jumpy in firefox and completely smooth in chrome, and why backface-hidden isn't working in chrome http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/108/
[01:59:29] <clarkk> looking at the last approach of these three  http://www.paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/  could someone tell me how it can work, when passing an id (rather than a set of elements)?
[01:59:59] <clarkk> he passes div#bodyContent a
[02:00:26] <clarkk> a, I see - it's all the anchors below the id
[02:01:12] <clarkk> ok forget I asked :)
[02:12:36] <doug65536> clarkk: I fail to see why so many js developers have this obsession with contorting their code so minifiers can make it smaller. seriously, parsing js is not the bottleneck!
[02:13:23] <clarkk> doug65536: I think it's a pretty elegant solution
[02:13:45] <doug65536> the "chosen" one? it's about as ugly and hacky as you can get imho
[02:14:27] <doug65536> slice has awful perforance, it uses short circuit evaluation as main flow control, and it recursively calls itself
[02:15:35] <doug65536> then the whole thing is wrapped in a minification trick, with the selector at the end in a parenthesis/brace soup
[02:16:24] <doug65536> and there's a missing semicolon :D
[02:16:37] <daslicht> anyone know a jquery plugin to show resize handles on images ?
[02:16:56] <daslicht> the only I found was jqueryUI resizable
[02:17:09] <daslicht> the others I found lets you just crop
[02:17:10] <clarkk> doug65536: heh, well done for spotting the syntax err :)
[02:17:26] <doug65536> I wish js crashed when semicolons were missing
[02:18:04] <doug65536> it's not that hard to put them in the right places. do you realize that the parser "tries" putting semicolons in when it hits an error. I wouldn't like to be the guy writing that parser - probably a mess
[02:18:27] <Hopsy> I am trying to make an ishikawa diagram creator with jquery, can someone help me with the lines
[02:19:57] <doug65536> clarkk: I got my 3d slider almost finished http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/118/
[02:21:04] <clarkk> doug65536: that doesn't do anything for me, I'm afraid
[02:21:15] <clarkk> the rotate button does not work
[02:21:28] <doug65536> clarkk: what browser?
[02:21:34] <clarkk> FF
[02:22:21] <doug65536> clarkk: can you test this one for me please? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/120/
[02:22:28] <clarkk> doug65536: it works in chrome. Very nice effect!
[02:22:40] <doug65536> I was experimenting with directly accessing the dom element - bypassing jquery
[02:22:47] <clarkk> doug65536: no, that doesn't work in FF either
[02:23:22] <doug65536> clarkk: weird... it works in FF 23.0
[02:23:45] <doug65536> for me anyway, in linux
[02:23:48] <clarkk> that's what I am using doug65536
[02:23:58] <clarkk> doug65536: I'm using ubuntu
[02:24:02] <clarkk> 12.04
[02:24:19] <doug65536> I'm using mint 14 (basically a fork of ubuntu 12.10)
[02:25:01] <clarkk> doug65536:  ok, it does work - noscript was blocking a necessary script
[02:25:04] <clarkk> not sure which one
[02:25:28] <boytoy> I think most cats in here use OpenBSD
[02:25:37] <doug65536> clarkk: is it all jumpy in FF for you?
[02:25:50] <Hopsy> doug65536: http://puu.sh/49AO4/9c297b3cff.png :O its animating outside of my browser window
[02:26:09] <doug65536> Hopsy: lol, wow
[02:26:52] <clarkk> doug65536: yes, it is jumpy. The corner separates as the box turns
[02:27:26] <doug65536> clarkk: I profiled it and over 90% of time is idle time... I had someone in #firefox try it and they said it is smooth in windows
[02:27:39] <doug65536> it says about 60 fps at the top?
[02:29:25] <doug65536> ah, this one looks "more 3d", the perspective is more obvious http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/121/
[02:30:09] <clarkk> doug65536: if mozillalabs.com is blocked, then towtruck.js cannot run and then your animation does not work. Not sure what towtruck is tho
[02:30:12] <doug65536> I know there are a few glitches, like momentarily showing the new image at start of slide... right now I'm concerned about poor ff performance
[02:30:26] <doug65536> towtruck is some jsfiddle thing
[02:30:54] <clarkk> interesting https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/
[02:30:56] <doug65536> this link eliminates all the jsfiddle stuff http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/aTsyS/121/show/
[02:31:01] <clarkk> not sure why that would have an effect
[02:31:21] <doug65536> yeah, jsfiddle uses it so multiple people can edit the same fiddle in realtime
[02:31:38] <doug65536> jsfiddle says it is "very beta" though
[02:32:41] <doug65536> I'll be adding a thing to "fly" around in 3d soon. that should be interesting
[02:33:15] <clarkk> doug65536: oops, I'm sorry, it's blocking jshell.net that causes the problem
[02:33:33] <doug65536> clarkk: you have some hardcore security utilities or something? :D
[02:34:35] <clarkk> I like to know what scripts are running on my machine. Everyone ought to be more aware imo
[02:34:59] <clarkk> the fps is 39.0
[02:35:03] <doug65536> my script barely even uses jquery
[02:35:26] <clarkk> not yours - the sites that I may visit
[02:35:32] <doug65536> ah ok
[02:35:38] <clarkk> the animation does not look good in ff I'm afraid
[02:36:07] <doug65536> yeah, the performance sucks in FF for some reason... which makes no sense, FF has amazing js performance, about 3x faster for the matrix math part of my script
[02:36:11] <clarkk> oh that time it was 49.1fps, but it didn't look very good
[02:36:37] <doug65536> it has to be a bug. in chrome it doesn't miss a single interval
[02:36:44] <doug65536> and it's over 90% idle
[02:37:51] <doug65536> I need to optimize it to update all animations in the same setInterval callback - it currently uses two separate ones
[02:38:05] <doug65536> well, a separate one per running animation
[02:38:54] <doug65536> it is actually capable of animating the position and rotation angle and axis of an arbitrary number of objects
[02:39:29] <clarkk> I don't suppose it's calling the images from http://placehold.it/ multiple times?
[02:39:51] <clarkk> good idea to use that for this example, btw
[02:39:55] <doug65536> there are 12 images
[02:43:11] <doug65536> clarkk, Hopsy thanks for testing it. maybe I should optimize it to share the same setInterval callback and see if that helps jumpy behavior on FF
[02:46:20] <Hopsy> [11:30:52] <clarkk> interesting https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/
[02:46:22] <Hopsy> niceee
[02:46:38] <Hopsy> clarkk: when is that project launched?
[02:54:52] <daslicht> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18417246/execcommand-inserthtml-outer-div-not-inserted-why
[02:57:32] <doug65536> daslicht: execCommand?
[02:57:39] <daslicht> yeah
[02:57:46] <daslicht> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Rich-Text_Editing_in_Mozilla#Executing_Commands
[02:58:01] <daslicht> its the browser built in Rich Text Editing feature
[02:58:33] <doug65536> daslicht: it is really poor practice to leave out all the semicolons http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gU2jP/3/
[02:58:46] <doug65536> also, the fiddle you posted to SE doesn't have jquery enabled
[02:59:16] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gU2jP/4/
[02:59:20] <daslicht> but that did not answer my question ?
[02:59:43] <doug65536> you insist on leaving a bunch of errors in your code?
[02:59:53] <daslicht> oklet me fix tghis
[03:00:38] <doug65536> the image inserts in the fiddle I posted
[03:00:41] <doug65536> what is wrong
[03:01:06] <daslicht> btw you dont need the ;
[03:01:10] <daslicht> one moment
[03:01:14] <doug65536> btw you do need the ;
[03:01:27] <doug65536> just because it tolerates invalid code doesn't make it ok
[03:01:39] <doug65536> when it encounters a parse error it "tries" adding a ;
[03:01:52] <daslicht> the ; added automatically as far as i know
[03:01:58] <daslicht> i add them
[03:02:49] <Hopsy> clarkk: Its not working for me :S
[03:03:43] <doug65536> daslicht: my fiddle works for you right?
[03:03:51] <daslicht> nope
[03:03:57] <doug65536> daslicht: then what is not right?
[03:04:12] <daslicht> one sec i create a better example
[03:04:21] <daslicht> wich even contains ; :)
[03:04:49] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/gU2jP/#base
[03:05:10] <daslicht> click in the content editable area
[03:05:16] <doug65536> trust me, I know stackoverflow people. they will see 10 missing semicolons and won't even post an answer
[03:05:18] <daslicht> and than press the insertImage button, please
[03:05:26] <daslicht> aye
[03:05:28] <daslicht> i fix that
[03:06:52] <doug65536> the image inserts. what am I supposed to expect?
[03:07:11] <daslicht> i have <div><img/...
[03:07:12] <doug65536> the div isn't there?
[03:07:17] <daslicht> but only the img is inserted
[03:07:18] <doug65536> ok, I'll make it more obvious
[03:07:37] <daslicht> i missed the div in teh first fiddle
[03:07:48] <daslicht> or it got lost somehow , i missed saving:)
[03:08:15] <doug65536> daslicht: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gU2jP/11/
[03:08:34] <doug65536> I made the div extremely obvious
[03:09:00] <daslicht> funny , its NOT working in Safari
[03:09:04] <daslicht> but in Chrome!
[03:09:04] <doug65536> the browser was probably being "smart" and threw away the useless div
[03:09:47] <doug65536> does execCommand even run in safari?
[03:09:57] <daslicht> yeah
[03:10:16] <daslicht> let me explain what I am trying to do
[03:10:29] <daslicht> I just like to make a inserted image resizable
[03:11:15] <daslicht> when i just set the img to resizeable using jqueryui it gets surrounded by an automatically generated div with the class ui-wrapper
[03:11:48] <daslicht> if I add a div manually i can add an id more easy
[03:11:58] <daslicht> eg to make it float left /right
[03:12:19] <daslicht> do you know a better way to make images resizable without jqueryUI ?
[03:12:49] <daslicht> would be nice to make it resizable without that surrounding div
[03:15:03] <doug65536> I can resize the inserted image in my fiddle
[03:15:28] <daslicht> yeh me too
[03:15:38] <doug65536> ok, then I don't know what's wrong
[03:16:08] <doug65536> first the div wasn't inserted. now that works. then it is image resizing. that works too. I don't know what is wrong now
[03:16:57] <daslicht> yeah that question is solved, it was due to safari
[03:16:57] <doug65536> why not use jquery-ui?
[03:17:23] <daslicht> I just wonder if there is a way to resize an image without that extra div's around it
[03:18:35] <doug65536> probably. I might be able to write up a resizer quickly
[03:19:04] <daslicht> do you have any suggestions wherer I could start to write my own ?
[03:19:29] <daslicht> how is that called ? moveable,  drag ?
[03:19:46] <daslicht> I dont know the correct search terms or even how to approach this :)
[03:20:54] <doug65536> make a function that attaches mousemove, mouseover and mouseleave, when cursor is near bottom right corner, set the cursor appropriately. if mousedown occurs around there, call element.setCapture, and get a snapshot of the current width and height. as they move the mouse, proportionally resize the image using css.
[03:21:26] <daslicht> ok cool , i try that !
[03:24:06] <daslicht> regarding using jqueryUI, if you set an image to resizable, jqueryUI will surround it by a div, If I want to enable float:left on it i have to select it somehow, If I just want this item to float left, i woudl have to give it an id, but how do i approach this when its generated automatically ?
[03:24:48] <doug65536> daslicht: simple, you have the id of the image right?
[03:24:54] <daslicht> yeah
[03:25:06] <doug65536> $('#the_image_id).parent().css({float:'left'});
[03:25:19] <daslicht> let me try :)
[03:25:24] <doug65536> oops missing '
[03:26:29] <doug65536> you might need quotes around float
[03:26:40] <doug65536> $('#the_image_id').parent().css({'float':'left'});
[03:26:45] <doug65536> daslicht: ^
[03:26:51] <daslicht> :)
[03:26:53] <daslicht> one moment
[03:27:00] <daslicht> thank you :)
[03:28:39] <daslicht> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/6cGbQ/
[03:28:40] <daslicht> cool

[03:28:58] <doug65536> yw
[03:29:43] <doug65536> daslicht: as shown, you'll end up with duplicate ids
[03:29:49] <doug65536> daslicht: that will cause problems
[03:30:06] <daslicht> yeh i will dynamically generate those
[03:30:15] <doug65536> ok
[03:30:22] <daslicht> first upload , than set id ...
[03:40:49] <daslicht> so lovely

[04:13:58] <blade> Hey, I'm trying to make my fade in/fade out animation reset if its been clicked during its animation, heres what I have http://pastebin.com/vgbQqiAA
[04:14:10] <blade> I fade it out quickly, but I need somethign to restart the rest.
[04:14:16] <blade> I tried timeouts and cleartimeout, no use.
[04:14:37] <blade> What happens is, instead of restarting the animation, it fades out then fades back in, but the delay doesn't reset.
[04:21:51] <doug65536> blade: put .stop() before the first fadeOut
[04:22:41] <doug65536> blade: and if that doesn't "look good", try .stop(true, false)
[04:23:08] <blade> testing
[04:23:32] <lolmaus> O
[04:24:40] <lolmaus> I'm using jQuery UI in my project. A textarea has become resizable though i didn't ask for it. Is this normal? Where is it documented?
[04:25:17] <blade> yeah still doesn't reset the delay()
[04:25:26] <blade> it continues in its first que of 8 seconds
[04:25:52] <blade> thanks for the try though doug65536
[04:25:59] <lolmaus> jQuery UI documentation suggests applying `.resizable()` to a textarea. But mine is resizable on its own.
[04:26:30] <doug65536> blade: hmmm. upon further looking, it appears to be an issue
[04:26:42] <blade> I think its delay thats the issue
[04:27:03] <blade> I tried converting to timeout but was unsuccessful or just didn't work
[04:27:09] <doug65536> blade: try replacing .delay(8000) with .animate({opacity:1}, 8000)
[04:27:30] <doug65536> blade: that will make .stop work
[04:29:26] <blade> doug65536, thanks it works, I have stop(true, false) should I switch to stop() for less coding or does it not matter?
[04:29:45] <blade> $("#password_complete").stop(true,false).fadeOut('fast').fadeIn('slow').animate({opacity:1}, 8000).fadeOut('slow');
[04:29:47] <doug65536> blade: true, false means, clear the queue, and don't jump to the end
[04:29:50] <blade> thats what I got now, is that correct?
[04:29:55] <doug65536> blade: so I would suggest keeping true, false
[04:30:08] <doug65536> blade: yes, that's right
[04:30:13] <blade> thanks man
[04:30:15] <blade> appreciate it
[04:30:18] <doug65536> yw
[04:30:31] <blade> just wondering though, what does the animate part do?
[04:30:47] <doug65536> it's a dummy animation that has no effect except taking 8000 ms to finish
[04:30:52] <blade> oh nice
[04:30:55] <blade> lol thanks man

[04:49:11] <cuqa__> hey, I googled but did not find aything. Is there a possibility to store a returned array (or list) directly to different variables?
[04:49:49] <cuqa__> e.g. [firstVar, secondVar] = this_function_returns_2_vars();
[04:50:34] <cuqa__> return line is: return [cmd, parameters];
[04:54:28] <screamingbanshee> not sure I understand your question cuqa__ but you are probably looking for $.each
[05:08:59] <clarkk> is it better to use "this" in an event or evt.currentTarget, when referring to the target element?
[05:09:14] <clarkk> or...in other words, what is the difference?

[09:28:12] <guest_____> hi can anyone tell me how to use a variable to set a variable's value? ex.  keyup sets tempID = <id of textbox> then tempID2 is set to <tempID+"_dis"> (the value at this point is "input1_dis") i have a variable called input1_dis and i want to use tempID2 to set the value of input1_dis(goes on to input10_dis)
[09:30:01] <Fuzai> How do you get a page to re-render after you've added data from ajax calls?
[09:30:48] <guest_____> right now i have tempID2 = $(this).val(); but that sets tempID2 to the value of the textbox
[10:14:50] <kegster> any idea why using $('.foo').on('click', 'button', function(e) { FB.login(); }); yields FB.login() called before FB.init() ??
[11:31:51] <Jemt> Hi. I have an interesting challange.. I need to be able to run multiple instances of jQuery (noConflict(true)), but that turns out to be a bit complicated when it comes to handling plugins. Plugins depend on the global jQuery object, and poorly designed plugins rely on $. So both must be available. But my plugins are loaded async, meaning it's probably a bad idea to set window.jQuery and window.$ to a specific version of jQuery, even temporarily. Any suggestions ?
[11:32:10] <Jemt> multiple instances of jQuery = multiple VERSIONS of jQuery
[11:38:35] <mitzev_> thar she blows
[11:52:50] <stephanedeuvae-1> http://jsfiddle.net/WszVQ/ $().load is causing a weird issue where the dom isn't loading fast enough for my next statement.
[12:05:41] <sunbeam> what would be the best responsive grid system to use? Bootstrap?
[12:07:17] <yogurt_truck> sunbeam: there's no single best (some people even dislike grid systems at all). opinions differ widely. your mileage may vary.
[12:07:46] <yogurt_truck> I use bootstrap in some projects and http://purecss.io in others
[12:08:48] <stephanedeuvae-1> yogurt_truck: I see you're here, too. Can you give me a more specific push than searching for asynchronous?
[12:08:48] <sunbeam> yogurt_truck: thanks
[12:11:10] <Jemt> Can I load a script and block the JS engine until loaded?
[12:11:33] <yogurt_truck> stephanedeuvae-1: have you read this http://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:12:06] <stephanedeuvae-1> yogurt_truck: yes, I did. Did you look at my fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/WszVQ/2/ What section do you think I'm not reading very well?
[12:12:09] <Kambfhase> scripts load synchronously by default and hence block JS execution
[12:14:15] <stephanedeuvae-1> yogurt_truck: I think the main issue isn't with the load, but with the html(). I don't know how to set a callback on that.
[12:20:07] <yogurt_truck> stephanedeuvae-1: how do you know "//This rowCount is correct" ?
[12:20:22] <stephanedeuvae-1> yogurt_truck: I'm alerting it
[12:20:27] <yogurt_truck> the code you're showing is small but somehow convoluted to me
[12:20:31] <stephanedeuvae-1> but that's a good point. I'm going to check again
[12:20:40] <yogurt_truck> comment out the call to //loadItems for a second
[12:20:55] <yogurt_truck> and console.log everything the function would use from there
[12:21:11] <yogurt_truck> so that you know that everything is there when you're supposed to call it
[12:22:06] <stephanedeuvae-1> great idea. I've been alerting instead and they've been correct, but console is less annoying.. old habits
[12:24:31] <TheTimeTraveller> hello

[12:44:01] <__elek> when does an $.ajax promise fire the error callback?  when it receives anything that isnt of status code 200 and/or the response content type doesn't match?
[12:44:19] <_guest> hi can someone tell me how to add text to a variable to make a new variable? ex. var end;     nd = test;        e+nd = nd;
[12:45:08] <_guest> this would make "end" and "nd" both = "test"
[12:47:10] <Kambfhase> var end, e; e="e"; end = e + "nd";
[12:47:38] <_guest> ok thanks
[12:48:27] <Kambfhase> Not sure if that is what you want though.
[12:48:47] <_guest> i think this is more what i need
[12:52:54] <_guest> what about this: var box1; <keyup sets tempC = textbox number(custom attr), and sets tempVal = $(this).val> then i want it to <box+tempC = tempVal>  this is to set the value of box<#> to the value of the texbox
[12:54:40] <_guest> then only problem i have with this (i think) is using the text and existing variable to make a new variable
[12:55:07] <_guest> (already declared)
[12:55:13] <Kambfhase> var num = $('.textbox').attr('customthing'), oldVal= $(this).val(); $('box'+num).val( oldVal );
[12:55:47] <_guest> ok thanks i will give this a try
[12:56:33] <Kambfhase> Btw, you cannot create a variable with some new identifier on the fly.
[12:56:45] <Axel> Hello people
[12:57:42] <OxDevs> Hi
[12:58:21] <Axel> is IRC still popular ?
[12:58:49] <Kambfhase> No, IRC is pretty much dead.
[12:59:52] <Snerf> its still pretty active in the dev and gaming communities
[13:00:13] <Snerf> but not at all like it used to be
[13:00:52] <Kambfhase> Yeah, also Usenet is not like it used to be.
[13:01:36] <Axel> What's the purpose of usenet, other than piracy ?
[13:02:55] <Axel> Anyway, I've got a problem with jQuery.
[13:03:00] <Kambfhase> ASCII Porn I guess. Back then, they didnt have real porn.
[13:03:22] <Axel> Thank god they do know
[13:03:29] <Axel> http://jsfiddle.net/UUNmM/
[13:07:33] <Kambfhase> Axel: you are doing it wrong.
[13:07:59] <Axel> Yea obviously
[13:10:04] <Axel> (but what am I doing wrong)
[13:12:15] <Kambfhase> Axel: How do you like this: http://jsfiddle.net/UUNmM/1/
[13:12:56] <_guest> Kambfhase what you gave me did not work
[13:12:58] <Axel> well, I made them all elements so I could use them later (for .click and .on)
[13:13:21] <Kambfhase> mkay
[13:13:26] <Kambfhase> (to both)
[13:14:12] <Axel> what does work is tr_activate.after, but I am wondering why my way does not work
[13:15:15] <Kambfhase> Axel: look closely, you append a <tr> to a <td> It should be the other way round
[13:15:29] <Axel> am I ?
[13:15:36] <DebianTUX> hey all.  i need to use jquery under a different namespace (formely: grp.jQuery) . i need to use printElement plugin, but it doesn't seems to register under the correct namespace for jquery. how do i fix this?
[13:15:43] <Kambfhase> _guest: "did not work" is not a proper problem description
[13:16:11] <_guest> sorry i am working on a jsfiddle right now
[13:17:32] <Kambfhase> Axel: or may be i was wrong there :Z/
[13:18:26] <Axel> I am applying after on an append on a tr, so a tr should come after a tr
[13:18:44] <_guest> kambfase can you go to this to see what i mean
[13:18:49] <_guest> http://jsfiddle.net/6yBM8/1/
[13:19:37] <Kambfhase> Axel: I just added an extra <td>: http://jsfiddle.net/UUNmM/2/
[13:20:09] <Axel> of course (facepalm)
[13:20:23] <Axel> thanks kambf
[13:20:24] <Kambfhase> _guest: What do you want to do? In general?
[13:20:26] <Kambfhase> np
[13:20:32] <Axel> yea_
[13:20:32] <_guest> i want to beable to use text1_dis later in another method so thats why i have it declared at the begining
[13:21:11] <_guest> it should take input from 10 text boxes and set the value to box<#>
[13:21:57] <Axel> Wait, Kambf, what's the difference between after and add ?
[13:22:07] <Kambfhase> _guest: have you tryed using an array?
[13:22:25] <_guest> no i am farly new to jquery and js
[13:22:42] <_guest> are you able to edit the fiddle
[13:23:29] <Kambfhase> Axel: x.after(y) inserts y after x into the DOM, whereas x.add(y) adds y to the jQuery Collection x. kinda like a push
[13:24:28] <Axel> Oh, thanks, wouldn't have found that out from the documentation
[13:24:38] <_guest> how does an array work
[13:24:47] <Jemt> Can I have $.getScript(..) block the JS thread until the data is received?
[13:27:01] <Kambfhase> _guest: http://jsfiddle.net/6yBM8/2/
[13:28:23] <_guest> where you put Number(tempDis) what does this do?
[13:28:23] <Kambfhase> Jemt: $.getScript() is just a shorthand method. If you use $.ajax() you can call it sync. see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[13:28:42] <Jemt> Kambfhase: Perfect, thanks
[13:28:51] <Kambfhase> Number( tempDis) turns tempDis into a number.
[13:29:59] <_guest> i am not sure we are understanding each other but thanks for your help and i will look into arrays a bit more but for now i must go
[13:30:10] <Kambfhase> _guest: read this: http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[13:30:25] <_guest> ok thanks
[13:30:31] <Kambfhase> fare well
[13:44:18] <artur99> hi
[14:01:29] <anew> anyone got a fast jq autocomplete plugin
[14:01:34] <anew> not sure if i like the default one from jq.com
[14:52:50] <sunbeam> html5 doesn't work anymore on vimeo? anyone?
[14:54:02] <T13|needsCoffee> What's the test to see if jQuery is running again? $('$'); ??
[14:55:22] <Kambfhase> put `jQuery` in your console.
[14:55:30] <Kambfhase> if thats a function, you should be fine
[14:56:47] <T13|needsCoffee> Okay.  How do I change the class of an element.
[14:57:13] <T13|needsCoffee> I have an element that is only identify by its innerHTML
[14:57:32] <T13|needsCoffee> and I want to change class from foo to foo bar
[14:57:50] <Kambfhase> $(element).addClass('bar')
[14:58:27] <T13|needsCoffee> Just a sec...  I'll paste you the element..
[14:59:18] <T13> <th title="Sort ascending" role="columnheader button" tabindex="0" class="headerSort">Blocked</th><th title="Sort ascending" role="columnheader button" tabindex="0" class="headerSort">Edit count</th>
[14:59:32] <T13> I can only tell it apart from the other 3 th elements by the innerHTML of "Edit count"
[15:00:35] <Kambfhase> $('th:contains("Edit count")').addClass('bar')
[15:01:10] <T13> $(th.headerSort).html("Edit count").addClass("headerSortDown");
[15:01:14] <T13> would that work?
[15:01:30] <T13> oh there.
[15:01:43] <T13> $('th:contains("Edit count")').addClass('headerSortDown')
[15:01:48] <Kambfhase> nope, yours wont work. :)
[15:01:50] <T13> trying it in console.. :)
[15:08:17] <T13|needsCoffee> I'm not sure if it is working or not
[15:08:18] <T13|needsCoffee> ..
[15:09:14] <T13|needsCoffee> Well... It changes the arrow but doesn't sort the table like I had hoped..
[15:50:26] <Keavon> I'm trying to use this line of code to scale and fade out a div to disappear:
[15:50:27] <Keavon> $("#trackboxWindow").animate({ opacity: "0" }, { queue: false, duration: 1000 }).hide("scale", { percent: 50 }, 1000);
[15:50:51] <Keavon> But it acts really strangely by jumping the div to the left and animating towards the center http://www.keavon.com/trackbox/
[15:51:44] <Keavon> (click the X button in the top right)
[16:28:21] <bonhoeffer> i'm doing an ajax read that gets an array, called votes, i really want a hash. for example, votes[2]

[16:28:51] <bonhoeffer> i want to do foo['CO05'] returns 3
[16:30:15] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: what's the array look like? ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item1', 'item4', 'item1', ...]?
[16:31:03] <bonhoeffer> https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/6330975#file-result-txt
[16:31:17] <bonhoeffer> the original json is : https://gist.github.com/tbbooher/6330975#file-response-json
[16:32:03] <sunbeam> just wondering, anyone who uses the HTML5 boilerplate, not getting tired of changing padding/margin etc all the time for ul's ?
[16:32:06] <sunbeam> I mean, *{margin: 0; padding: 0;} just looks so easier
[16:34:10] <bonhoeffer> my json looks like [{"VA08":4},{"CA12":1},{"CO05":3},
[16:34:29] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: are those all unique, or do objects with the same key reappear?
[16:34:32] <bonhoeffer> and i want to read this so i can do votes['VA08'] => 4
[16:34:36] <bonhoeffer> the keys are unique
[16:35:12] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: can you use es5 feature? like Object.keys()?
[16:35:28] <bonhoeffer> not sure what es5 is . . . but i can google
[16:37:34] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: nevermind, here's a version that will work in even ancient browsers: http://jsfiddle.net/TsC8P/
[16:38:38] <bonhoeffer> oh, simple enough!
[16:38:39] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: this will go from `[{ "VA08": 4 }, {  "CA12": 1 }, ...]` to `{ "VA08": 4, "CA12": 1", ...}`
[16:39:31] <jmar777> bonhoeffer: there's more elegant ways to do that with more "modern" browsers, but the one I linked to should work all the way back to like IE5.5 lol
[16:39:41] <bonhoeffer> yeah
[16:40:47] <bonhoeffer> but i wonder -- i think i can get this out as native json
[16:40:55] <bonhoeffer> i just need it in the right format

[18:15:41] <Es0teric> i want to execute a hover as long as a element with the class .bookmark does not contain the class .activeFav... how would i do that? i tried if( !$('i.bookmark').hasClass('activeFav') ) { //execute hover }
[18:19:59] <digibattery> hi
[18:20:38] <Whirl3d> $(".bookmark").not(".active-av").hover(.....
[18:22:04] <Whirl3d> sry, my "irc" monitor is going out on me. $(".bookmark").not("".activeFav").hover (a,b) will work.
[18:22:16] <digibattery> I am new to Javascript can someone tell what is happening here .. (function ($) {…} (JQuery)) .. I know it is an anonymous function but why are we writing Jquery at the end and giving the $ as the parameter … Thanks .. :)
[18:22:21] <hExDJ> are u guys familiar with Bootstrap?
[18:22:26] <digibattery> yes
[18:22:38] <hExDJ> is it possible to disable tabs for mobile only?
[18:22:45] <hExDJ> so that the user can just scroll
[18:22:58] <digibattery> use responsive design
[18:22:58] <Whirl3d> digibattery, it allows you to use $ inside the function to reference jquery in case $ is defined some other way
[18:23:10] <hExDJ> digibattery: that's the idea
[18:23:23] <Es0teric> Whirl3d what about after click?
[18:23:40] <Es0teric> Whirl3d becuase i also have a click targeting that
[18:23:42] <Es0teric> *because
[18:24:21] <Whirl3d> Es0teric, are you familiar with Jquery as a concept?
[18:24:33] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yes i am
[18:24:52] <Es0teric> Whirl3d nevermind
[18:24:53] <Whirl3d> then, yes it will work for click or whatever you want. Maybe I don't understand your question?
[18:25:34] <Es0teric> Whirl3d no you do not, i am saying i have two seperate functions... a hover and a click
[18:25:41] <Whirl3d> Hey, don't get your feelings hurt when someone tries to assess your level uf understanding. I just needed to know how I should approach the answer
[18:25:47] <digibattery> Whirl3d .. ok .. so can I do it this way -- (function($){…}(myownfunction)) .. so now can I call methods in my own function?
[18:26:04] <Es0teric> Whirl3d basically they are conflicting right now... wait i have some code i am going to show
[18:26:17] <Whirl3d> Once you select the elements using the selector I indicated, you can do whatever you want with it.
[18:27:31] <Whirl3d> $(".bookmark").not(".activeFav").hover(a,b).click(c);
[18:27:57] <Whirl3d> where a is the mouseover evvent handler   b is the mouseleave event handler and c is the click handler
[18:28:51] <digibattery> I know we typically use '$' for working with JQuery .. but where is this assigned in the JQuery.js? Do you have any idea?
[18:28:59] <Whirl3d> or $(".bookmark").not(".activeFav").on({mouseenter: a, mouseleave:b, click:c}); I believe is the preferred way, but i am not sure
[18:29:22] <Whirl3d> digibattery, that's why you pass it the jquery library at the end
[18:30:09] <digibattery> I got that .. but I the programs I wrote before I just included the script file in the head and then directly used the $ with out any assignment
[18:30:11] <Whirl3d> your function is saying given some parameter called "$", do these things. THat parameter fvalue is jquery
[18:30:41] <Whirl3d> right. This is just a more robust way of doing it to ensure no conflict
[18:30:43] <Es0teric> Whirl3d -> http://pastebin.com/5AxmPyYe
[18:30:55] <Whirl3d> $(function () { stuff}); is another way
[18:30:55] <Es0teric> also i am aware that line 30 is not exactly... valid
[18:31:27] <Whirl3d> first of all, Bookmark is an ID, not a class?
[18:31:35] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yes
[18:31:39] <Es0teric> but its also a class
[18:31:49] <Es0teric> only on that page though
[18:31:50] <Whirl3d> If that's the case, there can only be one bookmark. So the .not method is not the best
[18:32:11] <Es0teric> Whirl3d ok
[18:32:23] <Whirl3d> inside your handlers, add  var bm=$(this); if (bm.is(".activeFav") return;
[18:32:45] <Whirl3d> missed a closing ) before return, but you get the idea
[18:33:20] <Es0teric> Whirl3d ok just to make sure, handlers would be click and hover?
[18:33:56] <Whirl3d> you can't use if($("#bookmark").not("activeFave")) because it will always return true.
[18:34:17] <Es0teric> Whirl3d right... i have been seeing htat
[18:34:18] <Es0teric> *that
[18:34:20] <Whirl3d> even if jquery can't find a match for your selector it returns a 0 length jquery object
[18:34:58] <Whirl3d> if you want, you can check the length of the jquery object to see if it got the element selected. if ($(selector).length>0) {do stuff
[18:35:24] <Es0teric> Whirl3d but i want to specifically check #bookmark or .bookmark for .activeFav
[18:35:36] <Es0teric> its not in #mark-fav a
[18:36:20] <Whirl3d> are you familiar with jsbin? Try pasting the html and js in jsbin and it'll be a lot easier to help.
[18:36:39] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yeah sec...
[18:39:41] <Whirl3d> also, it looks like you are handling the click event on the parent element of an anchor (which is correct, I think), but $(this) refers not to the anchor, but the mark_fav element that holds the anchor...so no href there
[18:41:25] <Es0teric> Whirl3d right...but the anchor is what has the ID that i want... thats why i put it with $(this)
[18:41:50] <Whirl3d> okay, but then the click has to be managed on the anchor not it's parent
[18:42:16] <Whirl3d> $("#mark-fav") is the anchor's parent. ( i assume from the line above $("#mark-fav a")....
[18:42:34] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i thought the click was being managed on the anchor which is why i did #mark-fav a or was it supposed to be a#mark-fav ?
[18:43:03] <Whirl3d> my bad. You named the variable for the anchor the same as it's holder.
[18:43:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[18:44:01] <Whirl3d> using the pseudo :hover class in CSS you can skip a large portion of that
[18:44:33] <Whirl3d> set the background image to the main class and the :hover set the "hover icon" class. No JS, works like a charm.
[18:47:21] <Es0teric> Whirl3d wait what?
[18:49:11] <Whirl3d> I'm making a jsbin for you
[18:53:55] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i have the js bin of what i created but for some reason its not rendering in the jsbin
[18:54:16] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/ubuquqOG/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[18:54:39] <Whirl3d> did you add the library?
[18:55:26] <Whirl3d> in the css, use a backgorund image for the span element instead.

[18:57:10] <Whirl3d> are you sure that $=jquery and not node.js
[18:57:31] <lenswipe> Whirl3d, I'm not at all sure - but I have it working in other parts of my app so I would assume so
[18:57:37] <lenswipe> and I'm not getting any errors in the console
[18:57:45] <lenswipe> Whirl3d, plus - it's in the client side of the app
[18:57:49] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yes
[18:57:59] <Es0teric> nvm lol
[18:58:10] <Es0teric> but thats what i have for the click and hover, Whirl3d
[18:58:10] <lenswipe> it's like the event isn't registering
[18:58:12] <lenswipe> O_o
[18:59:25] <lenswipe> Whirl3d, http://pastebin.com/0vwHTEUw
[18:59:43] <lenswipe> note that line 3 (and all lines that refer to it's assigned variable) work perfectly
[18:59:44] <Whirl3d> lenswipe, gimme just a minute to finish with Es0teric
[18:59:47] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i made changes
[18:59:50] <lenswipe> sure - no probs
[19:00:41] <Es0teric> Whirl3d so how do i make the changes visible?
[19:01:31] <visua> i am bored
[19:01:34] <visua> and drunk
[19:02:04] <danielheth> strong combination when programming… i get my best work done in that condition visua
[19:02:19] <visua> :) I'm a designer, but sure.
[19:02:23] <lenswipe> danielheth, me too! let's be friends! o/
[19:02:27] <visua> I guess i'm a little better at programming drunk
[19:02:46] <lenswipe> visua, everyone is better at programming drunk, but watch out for the ballmer peak
[19:02:49] <visua> My programming skills are such shit
[19:03:01] <lenswipe> visua, danielheth relevant: http://xkcd.com/323/
[19:03:02] <visua> Been in a art director role for the past two years, and rarely write code these days
[19:03:09] <danielheth> my design skills are shit… LOL.
[19:03:22] <visua> haha xkdc is always on point, and relevant
[19:03:31] <lenswipe> danielheth, I like to dabble in both: http://jsondecode.co.uk <---I designed that
[19:03:32] <visua> I'm dicking around on webflow
[19:03:43] <visua> It's pretty neat, i'm worried the markup it produces will blow, but whatever.
[19:04:10] <danielheth> i designed http://bigfix.me, but spent way more time on the functionality of it.
[19:04:12] <Whirl3d> Es0teric I am not sure that your classes are set right for the "empty" version.
[19:04:15] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/OyEMAbe/2/edit?html,css,js,output
[19:04:43] <visua> I'm working on a new page for myself
[19:04:44] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/update.jpg
[19:04:56] <visua> needs a bunch of work
[19:05:25] <lenswipe> visua, :O
[19:05:30] <danielheth> i like it.
[19:05:48] <visua> I want to make the gradient fill color on the background relational to the x mouse position
[19:06:04] <visua> so absolute left would be that odd teal color, and the as you move across it updates to be more of a orangish color.
[19:06:05] <visua> er
[19:06:06] <visua> purple
[19:06:11] <visua> orange is one of my subs
[19:06:14] <lenswipe> visua, you seem to design deep artistic things with nice rich graphics
[19:06:17] <visua> But, im still laying it out
[19:06:24] <visua> lenswipe I try.
[19:06:29] <lenswipe> it looks really goo
[19:06:30] <lenswipe> good*
[19:06:32] <lenswipe> I like to design clean, simple things
[19:06:34] <visua> Thanks.
[19:06:38] <lenswipe> I suck at doing the kind of stuff that you do
[19:06:41] <Whirl3d> visua, you can either redraw the gradient and worry about banding
[19:06:49] <lenswipe> So I do clean simple blocky things instead
[19:07:02] <visua> lenswipe simple is good :)
[19:07:05] <Whirl3d> or your can place a transparent png gradient over the other and fade it out relative to mouse positiong
[19:07:08] <Whirl3d> position
[19:07:20] <lenswipe> visua, depends on the situation, for web apps(the stuff I normally do) it is - for portfolio sites  - less so
[19:07:20] <visua> Depends on my project, really. I work at an ad agency so i'm primarily working on art+copy rich stuff, but I love doing simple apps.
[19:07:39] <lenswipe> yeah ^ that
[19:07:46] <Es0teric> Whirl3d how do i push my changes though?
[19:07:52] <Es0teric> so you can see
[19:07:56] <visua> Whirl3d the two thoughts I had were either hotswapping pngs with background-cover, or doing a css3 gradient and adjusting that value relative to the mouse
[19:08:01] <visua> Not sure really.
[19:08:37] <Whirl3d> select share menu and lock changes to get a new url..
[19:09:08] <Whirl3d> visua, just what I said, really. LOL
[19:09:13] <visua> ;)
[19:09:13] <lenswipe> visua, this is the post comment thing that I did for the jsondecode site: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18851651/Screenshot%20from%202013-08-25%2003%3A08%3A37.png
[19:09:18] <visua> Did i mention i'm drunk, Whirl3d ?
[19:09:34] <visua> lenswipe nice. Very boostrap-esque
[19:09:39] <lenswipe> oh, really?
[19:09:44] <visua> But square :D
[19:09:45] <lenswipe> visua, it accepts markdown, and displays the parsed markdown in the comment box above
[19:09:59] <tw2113> drunk on a saturday, you don't say
[19:10:01] <visua> Nice.
[19:10:02] <tw2113> :P
[19:10:12] <tw2113> though i think you're past your ballmer's peak
[19:10:23] <visua> Time to enhance the booze with some fine greenery I think.
[19:10:28] <Es0teric> sup tw2113
[19:10:51] <lenswipe> visua, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18851651/markdown.png
[19:10:52] <Whirl3d> skip the greenery go for the powder...
[19:11:02] <visua> Hahaha, no way!
[19:11:21] <visua> lenswipe nice. Is that droid sans, or maybe open sans?
[19:11:32] <lenswipe> visua, open sans
[19:11:32] <Es0teric> Whirl3d since i dont know how to push my changes..... http://jsbin.com/OyEMAbe/1/
[19:11:42] <Es0teric> Whirl3d now you can see the actual icon
[19:11:46] <lenswipe> visua, if you defocus the box when it's empty - it collapses like...lemme grab a screenie
[19:12:13] <visua> How do you guys feel about Macaw?
[19:12:21] <Whirl3d> got it. Gimme a second to show you how css makes this easier
[19:12:29] <lenswipe> visua, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18851651/markdown.png
[19:12:36] <lenswipe> ewps
[19:12:39] <obert> css? what is it?
[19:12:40] <lenswipe> visua, https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18851651/collapse.png
[19:12:41] <visua> 404
[19:12:43] <lenswipe> that's what i meant
[19:12:51] <obert> 405, i win
[19:12:53] <visua> Ah
[19:12:56] <Es0teric> Whirl3d for the record, i am trying to make it so that when a user clicks it, it shows the filled in icon, and if the user clicks it again, it will show the empty icon
[19:13:03] <visua> lenswipe it's nice and simple, very functional.
[19:13:06] <Es0teric> but when its filled in, want the hover to be canceled
[19:13:06] <lenswipe> thanks :)
[19:13:15] <Es0teric> the on hover event
[19:13:32] <lenswipe> Es0teric, are you talking to me?
[19:13:56] <lenswipe> visua, feel free to have a poke at it:
[19:13:58] <Es0teric> lenswipe no, Whirl3d
[19:14:04] <lenswipe> Es0teric, oh, i see
[19:14:31] <visua> lenswipe no danger of that. I review my teams work all week, tonight is just about having fun designing :)
[19:14:51] <lenswipe> I didn't mean criticise - I just meant have a look around if you wish :P
[19:14:52] <lenswipe> http://www.jsondecode.co.uk/#!/
[19:15:17] <visua> K
[19:15:24] <visua> I need to put a movie on for some background noise :|
[19:15:39] <lenswipe> visua, do you watch stargate?
[19:16:28] <visua> Yeah I've watched it before.
[19:16:42] <lenswipe> you should watch that
[19:17:03] <visua> k, it's either stargate or frasier then
[19:17:11] <visua> go netflix
[19:17:43] <lenswipe> my girlfriend got me into watching "Crossing Lines" recently too - that's woth a look
[19:17:47] <lenswipe> worth* excuse me
[19:18:02] <visua> nice
[19:18:19] <visua> I really want to reorganize my battlestation, but I need some new furniture
[19:20:28] <lenswipe> visua, check this bad boy out: http://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/comments/17j4we/more_deathstar_than_battlestation/
[19:20:51] <visua> shit, is that yours?
[19:21:20] <lenswipe> hell no lol
[19:21:21] <lenswipe> i wish
[19:21:25] <visua> Haha
[19:21:28] <visua> Here's mine
[19:21:32] <visua> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/25010219/2013-08-22%2017.55.09.jpg
[19:21:38] <visua> my shitty little desk in the corner
[19:21:55] <lenswipe> visua, here's mine: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18851651/IMG_6621.JPG
[19:22:27] <visua> nice
[19:22:36] <lenswipe> it's changed a bit sine then but meh
[19:22:44] <visua> I see you do a bit of audio
[19:22:50] <lenswipe> yeah
[19:22:54] <lenswipe> just a touch
[19:23:22] <Whirl3d> Es0teric, http://jsbin.com/OyEMAbe/3/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[19:23:38] <visua> I'm on my work laptop, as usual, I'm thinking about buying a new imac
[19:23:51] <Whirl3d> using the :hover pseudo element to hide/show the spans is a lot faster than jquery
[19:23:52] <visua> this 22" acer screen blows. I'm really spoiled by the thunderbolt I have at work.
[19:24:03] <lenswipe> you have a thunderbolt monitor?
[19:24:05] <lenswipe> I hate you now
[19:24:10] <visua> I have two of them at work haha
[19:24:17] <visua> 27"
[19:24:17] <lenswipe> >: {
[19:24:26] <Es0teric> Whirl3d but i just want to target the a inside of #mark-fav
[19:24:30] <lenswipe> yeah, I don't know if we can be friends anymore
[19:24:35] <visua> I was thinking about my new desktop build as a mac mini + thunderbolt.
[19:24:35] <Es0teric> so would it just be #mark-fav a:hover ?
[19:24:42] <visua> But I'm just thinking I should go wtih a imac
[19:24:44] <lenswipe> visua, actually - i tell you what
[19:24:59] <lenswipe> that panel on the far right on my setup is a Dell monitor
[19:25:01] <visua> I don't really work when I'm not at my desk, and my nexus 7 is like my main 'surfing' device these days
[19:25:02] <lenswipe> I love it
[19:25:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/OyEMAbe/4/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[19:25:18] <lenswipe> 23" dell ultrasharp
[19:25:29] <visua> Nice, i've never worked on a dell monitor
[19:25:34] <lenswipe> I've always been sceptical of smell computers
[19:25:40] <lenswipe> but actually that panel is damn nice
[19:25:48] <visua> I've heard they are good.
[19:25:49] <Es0teric> Whirl3d no i am talking about in the css
[19:25:50] <Whirl3d> look at the classes in CSS, I also aded a line to js (commented out the hover stuff) and let you turn off the fav
[19:26:01] <Whirl3d> look at the css
[19:26:12] <visua> A big problem I have, is designing on the Thunderbolt, then I go to our testing stations with more popular consumer grade hardware
[19:26:14] <Whirl3d> :hover is your pseudo class for hover stats
[19:26:15] <visua> and it all looks way off.
[19:26:16] <lenswipe> visua, the build quality is a lot better than the optiplex's
[19:26:24] <lenswipe> the build quality inside those would make you cry blood
[19:26:34] <visua> haha
[19:26:36] <Es0teric> Whirl3d also i want it to be full on click but when hovered
[19:26:42] <lenswipe> ribbon cables folded like paper - the horror
[19:26:44] <lenswipe> *sob*
[19:26:49] <Es0teric> oh
[19:26:50] <Es0teric> i see
[19:26:51] <visua> O_O
[19:27:04] <lenswipe> lemme find a pic on the net
[19:27:08] <Whirl3d> I just made it red for fun
[19:27:46] <Whirl3d> notice that I have both the hover and unhovered states in the css for the marked fav state to the same thing. CLick again to uncheck the "fav" state
[19:27:50] <lenswipe> visua, http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/iBix6lgetZQ/maxresdefault.jpg, http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/rie7MuDQX8Q/hqdefault.jpg
[19:27:54] <lenswipe> look at the ribbon cables
[19:27:58] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yeah but... its not rendering the icon for some strange reason
[19:28:12] <Es0teric> i think it has something to do with adding .activeFav on the anchor
[19:28:19] <lenswipe> visua, but wait, there's more!
[19:28:25] <lenswipe> http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/9Q0lX4Xsh1o/maxresdefault.jpg
[19:28:31] <visua> is that good or bad? I don't know a great deal about hardware
[19:28:37] <visua> oh, well those look bad
[19:28:42] <lenswipe> those cables really shouldn't be folded like that
[19:28:49] <lenswipe> but you have to to be able to shut the damn case
[19:28:52] <visua> Yeah that I can imagine :O
[19:28:59] <Es0teric> Whirl3d also, when the icon is clicked, it disappears (on the jsbin)
[19:29:06] <Es0teric> it doesnt stay full
[19:29:15] <lenswipe> ...if you think about what that does to the little copper wires inside...
[19:29:19] <Whirl3d> on mine it turns red
[19:29:25] <lenswipe> do that enough times - eventually they're gonna break
[19:29:36] <lenswipe> because metal fatigue
[19:29:44] <Whirl3d> http://jsbin.com/OyEMAbe/4/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[19:29:53] <Whirl3d> now it turns red, but fades on hover
[19:30:01] <Whirl3d> (once clicked)
[19:30:32] <visua> That icon get full blue for me on rollover, and turns red on click
[19:30:44] <Es0teric> Whirl3d thats cool... but it doesnt render the icon for me
[19:30:52] <Es0teric> Whirl3d also, it disappears on click for me
[19:31:02] <Es0teric> on hover it turns red, but on click it disappears
[19:31:11] <Whirl3d> Turns red on hover?
[19:31:14] <visua> Behaviour all over the map!
[19:31:28] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i mean it turns red on click and disappears
[19:31:48] <Whirl3d> how can it turn red AND disappear?
[19:31:54] <Whirl3d> hmmm?
[19:32:04] <Es0teric> Whirl3d thats what happens for me
[19:32:17] <Whirl3d> if it's disappeared, how is it red?
[19:32:28] <Es0teric> Whirl3d it turns red first then disappears
[19:32:56] <Es0teric> and again, the icon does not render
[19:33:00] <Whirl3d> did you change the code?
[19:33:10] <Es0teric> Whirl3d nope
[19:33:23] <visua> Whirl3d works for me in Chrome and on Safari on osx.
[19:33:33] <visua> Wich is probably not news.
[19:33:40] <lenswipe> btw guys - I suddenly realised what my $.click() issue was and fixed it
[19:33:41] <lenswipe> :)
[19:33:43] <Whirl3d> Must be someone messing with your browser. I just checked it on 3 browsers all same bevhavior. Thanks visua..
[19:33:58] <visua> np
[19:34:06] <Es0teric> Whirl3d it works on chrome but not firefox...
[19:34:07] <Es0teric> thats strange
[19:34:09] <lenswipe> it was the usual dynamic data click listener malarkey
[19:34:11] <lenswipe> $('.catalogue .playlist-inner').on('click', '.song',function(){ fixed it
[19:34:36] <visua> Are you using a web font for the icon?
[19:34:41] <visua> I didn't look at the code.
[19:34:54] <Es0teric> Whirl3d why doesnt it work on firefox?
[19:35:11] <visua> But I've noticed that causes issue, especially if you have some sort of type manager running. FontExplorere wrecks some sites for me.
[19:35:30] <Es0teric> Whirl3d -> http://puu.sh/4aayM.png thats what my firefox sees...
[19:35:42] <Whirl3d> no support for that icon feature
[19:35:55] <Whirl3d> look in firebug
[19:36:20] <visua> Hmm..i wonder if its too late to make bacon
[19:36:22] <Es0teric> Whirl3d where in firebug do i look?
[19:36:32] <Whirl3d> console.
[19:36:37] <Whirl3d> it'll list a bunch of errors
[19:36:39] <{{Guy|sleeps}}> visua: are you ill?
[19:36:49] <Es0teric> Whirl3d theres no error for it
[19:36:52] <visua> Yeah i'm pretty ill with it, yo.
[19:37:16] <{{Guy|sleeps}}> It's NEVER too late for bacon.
[19:37:30] <Whirl3d> I click run with js and get 3 pages of errors
[19:37:31] <visua> :]
[19:37:53] <Whirl3d> it's not getting the font awesome font to download correctly
[19:38:01] <{{Guy|sleeps}}> Unless you prefer broccoli...
[19:38:23] <Whirl3d> prolly need something like modernizer or another shim
[19:38:56] <Es0teric> Whirl3d yeah most likely
[19:41:16] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i will try this stuff now.. thanks, i appreciate it
[19:42:17] <visua> So…I layed this out in webflow in like an hour
[19:42:20] <visua> http://novia.webflow.com/
[19:42:28] <Whirl3d> no problem. Look at using sprites even. Then you have one image (that works in all browsers) and you shift it over or down to get the different states
[19:42:39] <visua> It works a lot better than I had expected..it's still not as good as just writing the markup and shit
[19:42:51] <visua> but its a big productivity booster I suppose.
[19:43:22] <Es0teric> Whirl3d i just saw a fix for it... i mean it shows on my local dev so i guess i'll switch over the .htaccess into my live server once i get this up and running
[19:44:29] <visua> Cleaner markup than a lot of the alternatives, lol.
[19:44:41] <Whirl3d> visua, on my 37" Dell Ultrasharp it is HUGE. looks good though
[19:44:55] <visua> Whirl3d huge is good.
[19:45:12] <visua> But, yeah there is no max-width, its just assuming a fluid grid.
[19:45:18] <visua> I think a 37" is a bit of an outlier anyway :)
[19:45:53] <Whirl3d> is it supposed to be on two vertical pages?
[19:46:10] <visua> Not sure what you mean
[19:46:53] <Whirl3d> I wondered if the content was supposed to fit on one screen or two. But now that I shrunk the window, it's 3
[19:47:16] <visua> Yeah there are just a few vertical sections
[19:47:30] <visua> I have a few more in my comp that I haven't added in yet.
[19:47:46] <visua> But, i'm actually pleasantly suprised with webflow.
[19:48:04] <visua> As I assume most of us, are skeptical of design tools that spit out markup and css :X
[19:48:17] <Whirl3d> also, you might want to center your clientelle artwork in thier containers'
[19:48:25] <Whirl3d> It looks good when resized
[19:48:29] <visua> Yeah, i'm fighting that.
[19:48:53] <visua> I centered it in webflow, didn't seem to work. I think i'll still have a bunch of work to do after I lay it out intitally
[19:49:23] <visua> cleaning up a lot of the stuff, and then doing js.
[19:49:35] <Whirl3d> Well, make the screen xtremely vertical.. They go to one column. Then go back to normal and they are still in one column
[19:49:38] <visua> It also crunches the images to a fairly low quality, wich I don't like.
[19:49:59] <visua> Whirl3d, hmm. What browser/os?
[19:50:13] <Es0teric> Whirl3d thats why its not displaying the stuff on jsbin... because you are supposed to put the icons inside <i> not <span>
[19:50:18] <visua> I haven't touched any of the media queries yet, just doing the desktop view atm. But that would be bad.
[19:50:24] <Es0teric> so firefox wont pick up on that
[19:50:26] <Whirl3d> Actually I am using a chrome hack called Cool Nuovo
[19:50:31] <Es0teric> unless its in an <i>
[19:50:48] <Whirl3d> inside <i>
[19:50:56] <Whirl3d> I forgot that was even valid
[19:52:26] <Es0teric> well its still not displaying on jsbin but i'll see if it works for chrome
[19:53:01] <visua> man that bacon smells good
[19:53:13] <Es0teric> yep it works for chrome
[19:55:06] <Whirl3d> visua, I just had pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon. How'd you know?
[19:55:33] <visua> Hehe.
[19:55:42] <visua> I was talking about the bacon I have on the pan atm.
[19:55:53] <visua> But damn..bacon wrapped tenderloin sounds good.
[19:58:38] <visua> So, I have a question about some js. I really like flash style preloaders, but don't really know much about building them for html.
[19:58:47] <visua> I used prettyloaded in the past, but that seems outdated?

[19:59:15] <visua> I like this, having just a gif or something.
[19:59:56] <visua> Damn booze. I meant QueryLoader, not prettyloaded.
[20:00:14] <Es0teric> Whirl3d how do i increase the anchor spot to hover over?
[20:00:30] <Es0teric> for some reason, when i hover over its not really letting me click... i think its because the hotspot for the anchor is small
[20:03:21] <Whirl3d> set display:block on the anchor
[20:04:28] <Es0teric> hmm it doesnt seem to be the anchor..
[20:05:13] <Whirl3d> that's something screwy with the way you are loading your icons., I guess
[20:07:23] <Es0teric> Whirl3d another thing that just happened, when click, .activeFav is added but the hover doesnt stay
[20:07:41] <Es0teric> meaning when its clicked, it goes back to empty BUT when i hover, it turns red
[20:07:55] <Es0teric> this is not on the jsbin, this is on my actual project
[20:10:32] <Whirl3d> right. that's what I was saying. Click it again and  it will go back to the hover effect
[20:11:01] <Es0teric> Whirl3d no... when i clicked it once it went back to the hover effect
[20:12:50] <Es0teric> Whirl3d nvm, i converted the css into LESS so i did it wrong
[20:12:55] <Es0teric> i just did it the right way
[20:13:02] <Whirl3d> wow
[20:13:15] <Whirl3d> I gotta run. Good luck with all that. I'll check back in a while.
[20:15:26] <Es0teric> no doubt, Whirl3d.. thanks again for the help, man
[20:39:18] <visua> hmm
[21:40:23] <jarray52> I have a dateinput (jquery-ui) handler bound to an input html tag. The calendar widget works find until the form is submitted. After the form submission, the handler becomes unbound from the input tag and no longer works. How does one go about fixing this?

[21:43:15] <hExDJ> does anyone know how to disable Bootstrap tabs, only when viewing a page on a Mobile (small screen)
[23:09:28] <Tingle> hi, I seem to have this issue where none of my js code works... http://hastebin.com/fiqehoreto.coffee this is inside my scripts.js, and when I click on on of the buttons/links, nothing happens, they don't hide and the click still works.
[23:13:58] <Tingle> any ideas :/?
[23:14:30] <infugia> and the click still works?
[23:14:49] <Tingle> yea
[23:15:04] <infugia> what d o u mean
[23:15:04] <Tingle> not even $('document').hide(); works
[23:30:21] <Tingle> is there a way one can disable that a link target shows up when you mouse over it?
[23:30:53] <jarray52> I have a jquery-ui calendar embedded inside a jquery reveal form. The calendar works fine until the form is submitted. After submission, the calendar no longer works. What could be causing this problem? I checked the debugger, and the focus handler that makes the calenar display on the screen is no longer there.
[23:46:04] <lentan> hi, i'm trying to use $.ajax to screen scrape from a website that needs username and password authentication. How do I go about doing that?
[23:54:20] <doug65536> lentan: you mean HTTP authentication?
[23:55:33] <doug65536> lentan: it's not likely to work, unless you do some server side programming, and have your server fetch the page on your behalf
[23:55:58] <doug65536> lentan: do you have complete control over the server serving that page?
[23:56:30] <doug65536> lentan: why it probably won't work: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[23:56:49] <doug65536> lentan: you can easily sidestep that problem by having your webserver get it on your behalf
