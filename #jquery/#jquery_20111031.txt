[00:26:31] <{-_-\\\> hi
[00:27:06] <{-_-\\\> how can i scale font sizes depending on container height?
[00:27:56] <IWT> if the container has a px height and not % you can use some math logic to update the css definition for the font size
[00:28:22] <{-_-\\\> um, container has 'auto' height
[00:28:46] <{-_-\\\> http://www.trolls.lv/%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F/6
[00:28:49] <{-_-\\\> see here
[00:28:53] <{-_-\\\> website is completely scaleable
[00:29:04] <Cork> {-_-\\\: $container.css('fond-size', $container.height() + 'px')
[00:29:16] <{-_-\\\> i need text inside container to always occupy 100% of its height
[00:29:19] <Cork> bind that to resize and you should be farly close
[00:29:23] <{-_-\\\> so no scrollbars appear if window is small
[00:29:29] <{-_-\\\> and no empty space if windows is large
[00:29:40] <{-_-\\\> Cork: um, text is multi-line
[00:29:45] <{-_-\\\> and there is html markup too
[00:30:01] <Cork> then your farly scruwed
[00:30:04] <{-_-\\\> i need to scale everything to be 100% height and calculate width with aspect keeping
[00:30:09] <IWT> Doing it off an auto sizing box is bad news anyway
[00:30:10] <{-_-\\\> Cork: how about cufon?
[00:30:12] <Cork> cause there isn't really any way to detect overflows
[00:30:23] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to scale it with cufon somehow?
[00:30:29] <Cork> unless adding html elements and grabin there positions
[00:31:00] <{-_-\\\> i'm just exploring different solutions now
[00:31:04] <Cork> {-_-\\\: the dom doesn't provide you with the information needed to do it cleanly
[00:31:20] <{-_-\\\> Cork: how about specifying style for each cufon canvas in % ?
[00:31:32] <Cork> you would have to add loads of ex. spans and grab there position and from that calculate if the word has overflown or not
[00:31:40] <{-_-\\\> then if i will have 10 lines of text - they can be defined as 10% height
[00:31:48] <Gorkyman> hm, I want to select one random li out of ul... any recommendations?
[00:31:48] <IWT> Now if you were using javascript to define the box sizes in px you would be in a bit better shape
[00:31:57] <Cork> {-_-\\\: thats more or less what i just told you, but you would have to ex. add a span for each word
[00:32:06] <{-_-\\\> IWT: well my website also works without js
[00:32:08] <{-_-\\\> that's the point
[00:32:15] <{-_-\\\> i don't want to remove this feature
[00:32:20] <IWT> Then you are screwed anyway if you want it to work without js
[00:32:27] <Cork> ya
[00:32:27] <{-_-\\\> Cork: isn't it what cufon does?
[00:32:38] <{-_-\\\> IWT: i am fine if there will be scrollbars without js
[00:32:44] <Cork> no it uses canvas
[00:32:49] <{-_-\\\> but with js i want everything fancy
[00:32:53] <{-_-\\\> Cork: can't canvas be scaled?
[00:33:01] <IWT> Gorkyman: use an auto incrementing id field for each li element
[00:33:12] <IWT> then use a random function to randomly pick an id #
[00:33:22] <Cork> {-_-\\\: the difference between drawing in canvas and rendering with dom is you get no help positioning things
[00:33:33] <Cork> {-_-\\\: you would have to calcuate it your self
[00:33:36] <Gorkyman> IWT: I cant add auto incr. id to li el...
[00:33:52] <IWT> umm yes you can unless you give a good reason
[00:34:25] <Gorkyman> those elements are user created
[00:34:33] <IWT> You can use js to step thru the li dom and add the id in
[00:35:12] <Cork> if you step through the li elements most of the time you don't need to add id's
[00:35:29] <IWT> Well when he wants to grab a random one depending on the setup he may need to
[00:35:37] <Cork> nope
[00:35:44] <Cork> just grab them in a selector
[00:35:48] <Cork> and do a random
[00:36:07] <IWT> if he has more than one ul the id helps simplify things
[00:36:17] <Gorkyman> only one ul
[00:36:27] <Cork> var source = $('ul li'); source.eq(Math.Math.random() * source.length)
[00:36:31] <Cork> opps
[00:36:37] <Cork> var source = $('ul li'); source.eq(Math.random() * source.length)
[00:36:51] <IWT> oh yea forgot about that :D
[00:37:26] <Cork> youl prob want to ad a Math.floor too
[00:37:34] <Cork> *add
[00:37:44] <Gorkyman> where?
[00:37:54] <Cork> Math.floor(Math.random() * source.length)
[00:38:07] <Cork> else you get index 5.22524 and things like that
[00:41:21] <Gorkyman> ok, that works nicely
[00:41:22] <Gorkyman> thanks to both
[00:41:41] <IWT> I need to finish learning all these functions :-/
[00:42:13] <FloLeBlanc> is there anything I need to do to "activate" jquery except from including the libraries? no matter what function or what id I use I always get "the object is  null or undefined" (an alert with document.getElementById works though)
[00:42:33] <IWT> including the libraries enables the jquery functions
[00:42:52] <Cork> ?p @ FloLeBlanc
[00:42:52] <bot-t> FloLeBlanc, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:43:48] <IWT> *bashes head into table*
[00:44:22] <FloLeBlanc> The code: http://jsfiddle.net/KssZV/
[00:44:46] <Tobsn> FloLeBlanc, make sure script src="jquery src"><(omg
[00:44:56] <Tobsn> omg
[00:45:38] <Tobsn> typo3 war ne schelchte entscheidung
[00:46:13] <Tobsn> youre first including jquery
[00:46:18] <Tobsn> then prototype
[00:46:57] <Tobsn> http://www.billardcafe.at/typo3conf/ext/mm_forum/res/scripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js?1298626845
[00:47:00] <Tobsn> and youre using jquery 1.3.2
[00:47:06] <Tobsn> thats literally 2 years old
[00:48:04] * IWT wonders if a visual studio or c++ irc channel actually exists on any network...
[00:48:05] <FloLeBlanc> Tobsn: comes from an extension that can enable http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/ and this page is for testing purposes only atm, I had a direct link to the most current js and switched to that one due to the noconflict to keep the code I type myself as short as possible (reducing errors)
[00:48:29] <Tobsn> either way youre having a huge mess there
[00:48:30] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: something is overwriting jquery
[00:48:42] <Tobsn> its probably prototype
[00:48:51] <Tobsn> the version is probably as old as the jquery
[00:50:23] <Cork> Tobsn: yup, exactly
[00:50:44] <Cork> you can use jQuery() though
[00:51:05] <Tobsn> ah
[00:51:15] <Tobsn> FloLeBlanc, i wrote a little jail for jquery testing a while ago
[00:51:17] <Tobsn> its not perfect
[00:51:22] <Tobsn> but you can probably use it
[00:51:57] <Cork> or you can scope your code and fix it that way (function($){})(jQuery)
[00:52:23] <Tobsn> https://gist.github.com/736705
[00:52:28] <Tobsn> yeah that would work too i guess
[00:52:33] <FloLeBlanc> thank you cork and tobsn
[00:53:10] <FloLeBlanc> It's a bit hard to keep the code "clean" with extensions - I can't just "hack" them because of possible security updates - perhaps I should just be pickier with my selection
[00:53:43] <Tobsn> you should move them off typo3
[00:53:50] <Tobsn> since 10 years i tell people its a terrible cms
[00:53:54] <Cork> FloLeBlanc: if you mean jquery extensions, they should already be scoped like that unless they don't follow best bractis
[00:54:09] <Tobsn> if a script language basic cms has a download > 20mb
[00:54:11] <Tobsn> thats a bad sign
[00:54:13] <FloLeBlanc> Tobsn: that depends on your point of view. I like it
[00:54:33] <Tobsn> not really
[00:54:37] <Tobsn> cork, he means typo3
[00:54:49] <Tobsn> hes gonna load jquery 1.3.2, prototype and a new version of jquery
[00:54:50] <Tobsn> hehe
[00:55:11] <Cork> well loadng both prototype and jquery isn't a problem most of the time
[00:55:17] <Cork> loading two versions of jquery is though
[00:55:29] <Tobsn> loading 3 javascript libraries is a bit overkill
[00:55:37] <Tobsn> but so is typo3 so i guess it fits :P
[00:55:45] <jrockjiggz> just use noConflict(); it works fine
[00:55:56] <jrockjiggz> I run 2 versions of jQuery and prototype with no probs
[00:56:15] <jrockjiggz> *have run
[00:56:16] <Cork> jrockjiggz: they should overide eachother jQuery object though
[00:56:33] <Cork> so you would have to call code inbetween the loads
[00:56:38] <jrockjiggz> load jquery, define noConflict variable.  load new jquery, again define noConflict var
[00:56:49] <jrockjiggz> yea
[00:56:53] <jrockjiggz> sorry i didnt see that
[00:57:12] <Tobsn> im injecting jquery with greasemonkey... i just copied the jquery code and replaced jquery with jqri and $ at the end of the code to ___
[00:57:21] <Cork> and to top it of, most of the time there isn't really a need to load multible versions of jquery
[00:57:25] <Tobsn> so there will never be a conflict
[00:57:46] <Tobsn> nice, i just installed siri on my iphone 4 and now its stuck in booting
[00:58:59] <jrockjiggz> ?G reboot iPhone 4
[00:59:01] <bot-t> jrockjiggz, How to reboot the iPhone 4 - YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbx_UMosemU
[00:59:10] <Tobsn> i know how to do that
[00:59:17] <Tobsn> its still stuck in the white apple boot screen
[00:59:21] <Tobsn> very neat...
[00:59:38] <jrockjiggz> well if the power goes out.. you have a flashlight
[00:59:45] <FloLeBlanc> lol
[00:59:49] <Tobsn> a very dim one
[01:00:18] <Tobsn> i just jailbreaked it to reinstall grooveshark after i updated to iOS5... and now this
[01:00:18] <jrockjiggz> Tobsn: might have to wait until its dead
[01:00:19] <Tobsn> maaaan...
[01:00:23] <Tobsn> dead?
[01:00:27] <Tobsn> well it will reboot
[01:00:31] <Tobsn> basically turn off
[01:00:34] <Tobsn> and i can turn it on again
[01:00:41] <Tobsn> but i only get the apple
[01:01:47] <Tobsn> ?G iOS5 stuck in boot loop
[01:01:48] <bot-t> Tobsn, iOS 5 Semi Tethered Jailbreak Released, Here's Your Full Guide! - http://cydiahelp.com/ios-5-semi-tethered-jailbreak-released-heres-your-full-guide/
[01:01:52] <Tobsn> hehe
[01:02:08] <jrockjiggz> Tobsn: press and hold the yop button and home button till the screen gose black (let go befor the apple logo comes up) then plug your iphone into your pc ect but hold down the home button. you will have to restore the phone but thats the only way i know.
[01:02:21] <jrockjiggz> from google..
[01:02:28] <Tobsn> yeah i know
[01:02:31] <Tobsn> thats how i keep rebooting
[01:02:44] <jrockjiggz> anyways.. this shouldn't be discussed here
[01:02:58] <Tobsn> semitether is a dumb idea... it tether boots your iOS5 but you cant use mail, safari and something else
[01:03:00] <Tobsn> lol.
[01:03:01] <Tobsn> yeah
[01:04:24] <FloLeBlanc> sorry I'm rather new to jquery, would the correct link for the newest library then be: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4.js" type="text/javascript"></script> ?
[01:05:27] <{-_-\\\> are there any php / js solutions for detecting non-graphical browsers and displaying images in ascii-art for them?
[01:06:01] <blackspotwiggins> {-_-\\\, would non-graphical browsers have js?
[01:06:05] <Tobsn> hehe
[01:06:09] <Tobsn> i think links has
[01:06:17] <blackspotwiggins> the graphics version has
[01:06:23] <Tobsn> sure?
[01:06:29] <Tobsn> i think the text version does something with JS too
[01:06:31] <{-_-\\\> blackspotwiggins: no
[01:06:31] <blackspotwiggins> well, the ascii one does not for sure
[01:06:35] <jrockjiggz> you can detect browser with PHP
[01:06:36] <Tobsn> hmm
[01:06:38] <Cork> Tobsn: just do a quick google for php image to ascii you'll get a lot of hits
[01:06:44] <Tobsn> ?
[01:06:53] <{-_-\\\> <img ... > stuff can be detected in php and substitutes with ascii art i think
[01:06:55] <Tobsn> im not crazy
[01:06:58] <Tobsn> {-_-\\\ is
[01:07:01] <{-_-\\\> substituted *
[01:07:05] <Cork> ah heh
[01:07:14] <Tobsn> {-_-\\\ you can only build a ascii only version of that page
[01:07:24] <Tobsn> like a mobile version etc.
[01:07:38] <{-_-\\\> Tobsn: why? can't i use some php lib to just parse template and replace all <img ... > to corresponding inline ascii arts?
[01:07:51] <Tobsn> well
[01:07:58] <Tobsn> i dont really see the use of it in the first place
[01:07:58] <blackspotwiggins> write the lib firs then
[01:08:04] <blackspotwiggins> it's one in a billion use case
[01:08:09] <blackspotwiggins> noone else needs it
[01:08:17] <Tobsn> all those image to ascii converters dont give you actual images
[01:08:23] <Tobsn> they convert it into text but A LOT of text
[01:08:28] <juha_> hello peeps
[01:08:37] <Tobsn> imagine each pixel = 1 character
[01:08:51] <{-_-\\\> Tobsn: still, website will look much better than simple text
[01:08:55] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: latest from googleapi is https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js
[01:09:03] <Tobsn> if youre talking about displaying that in a console... you would only see 70-90 pixels ;)
[01:09:05] <FloLeBlanc> jrockjiggz: thank you
[01:09:10] <{-_-\\\> Tobsn: which is fine
[01:09:16] <{-_-\\\> i can use gd to resample image first if i need
[01:09:17] <Tobsn> you can just do what links already does
[01:09:20] <{-_-\\\> don't see a problem there
[01:09:24] <Tobsn> display the title of the img tag
[01:09:26] <{-_-\\\> Tobsn: well i need it not only for links
[01:09:30] <{-_-\\\> but also for lynx, telnet, etc
[01:09:34] <Tobsn> [This is an image with an apple]
[01:09:39] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: find 'jquery' and look at 'path' http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#versioning
[01:09:39] <{-_-\\\> um, lkol
[01:09:42] <{-_-\\\> no
[01:09:50] <{-_-\\\> image title won't do
[01:09:59] <Tobsn> yeah youre up to waste a lot of time for a very little return
[01:10:05] <jrockjiggz> i know theres a short way to have the latest..
[01:10:40] <blackspotwiggins> {-_-\\\, yeah i guess TONS of people use telnet to browse the web
[01:10:52] <blackspotwiggins> because they natively speak http
[01:10:54] <blackspotwiggins> and parse html
[01:10:58] <blackspotwiggins> in their head
[01:11:06] <Tobsn> i wonder how many people actually use lynx
[01:11:17] <Tobsn> as their main browser
[01:11:32] <Tobsn> maybe some old military stations somewhere in northern russia
[01:11:35] <Tobsn> :)
[01:12:04] <{-_-\\\> blackspotwiggins: still somebody can do it
[01:12:10] <{-_-\\\> or fetch website's data for wget
[01:12:20] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: latest version always up to date: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js
[01:12:20] <{-_-\\\> for ascii images parsing
[01:12:54] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: shortest filename: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js
[01:13:05] <Tobsn> {-_-\\\ you really want to waste your time on that?
[01:13:21] <{-_-\\\> if there are ready solutions - i won't waste much ofit
[01:13:28] <Tobsn> no there arent
[01:13:51] <Tobsn> esp not in JS
[01:13:55] <Tobsn> cause that wouldnt make sense
[01:13:55] <blackspotwiggins> why do you ask this in #jquery anyway
[01:14:00] <Tobsn> maybe you want to ask in #python
[01:14:04] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: and last but not least, google api 1.x.x http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
[01:14:05] <blackspotwiggins> get to googling if you really care
[01:14:12] <Tobsn> that language is old enough that someone maybe have done that 15 years ago
[01:14:34] <{-_-\\\> um, i can't have it in js anyway
[01:14:39] <Tobsn> FloLeBlanc, jrockjiggz, which you shouldnt do because most big sites link to the full version number
[01:14:43] <{-_-\\\> because most text browsers doesn't support js
[01:14:47] <Tobsn> cause you want the caching to hit
[01:15:48] <FloLeBlanc> full version number being the link with 1.6.4? (so you'll want to update the link each time a new version arrives?)
[01:17:31] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: when you use ...jquery/1/jquery.min.js  it is the latest 1.x possible version.   if you use ...jquery/1.6/jquery.min.js  it is the latest 1.6.x version
[01:17:56] <jrockjiggz> so that last link is good up until they release jQuery 2
[01:18:11] <Tobsn> which wont happen until 2015
[01:18:51] <FloLeBlanc> yeah but what I meant is how do I "hit the caching" as tobsn meant. It's not as I would know when the other people upgrade from 1.6 to 1.7) (heck some companies even still use IE6 :))
[01:19:25] <jrockjiggz> sorry i don't know what you mean
[01:19:27] <Tobsn> use full version numbers
[01:19:29] <Tobsn> 1.6.4
[01:20:06] <FloLeBlanc> yep, but when 1.6.5 arrives, the "caching advantage" will only work if many other people also update their link wouldn't it?
[01:20:21] <{-_-\\\> is Connection: keep-alive better for ajax than Connection: close ?
[01:20:22] <Tobsn> most big sites will stick with that version for a long time
[01:20:34] <Tobsn> lets say the top 20 sites who use jquery
[01:20:36] <{-_-\\\> assuming server is behind varnish
[01:20:39] <Tobsn> hosted at google
[01:20:44] <Tobsn> they probably are still all on 1.6.2
[01:21:08] <FloLeBlanc> wouldn't I have to link to 1.6.2 to take advantage of the caching then?
[01:21:19] <Tobsn> just put in 1.6.4
[01:21:23] <Tobsn> and dont think too much about that
[01:21:32] <Tobsn> rather fix your typo3 stuff ;)
[01:22:10] <FloLeBlanc> Tobsn: I removed the duplicate jquery inclusion, linked to the most current version and try using noconflict. this results in the same error as before tough - still working on it :(
[01:26:48] <jrockjiggz> FloLeBlanc: if this helps..  var $$$ = jQuery.noConflict(true);   then use $$$( function($){  $('body').html('hello'); });
[01:26:50] <FloLeBlanc> oh nice - I managed to hide the box now. the only error left is "the object doesn't support this property or method when using datepicker()
[01:27:24] <FloLeBlanc> jQuery("#datamints_feuser_1320_date_of_birth").datepicker(); won't work - jQuery("#datamints_feuser_1320_date_of_birth").hide(); does though
[01:28:35] <sgronblo> Shouldn't I get some sort of error/warning message in the chrome console if I violate the same site policy?
[01:34:16] <jrockjiggz> sgronblo: im pretty sure you get the warning if you violate it off the site
[01:34:27] <jrockjiggz> ie if you violate it in another frame
[01:35:11] <{-_-\\\> is anybody familiar with .animate here?
[01:36:52] <omid> Hi guys, i have a problem with keyboard events and i want to know how can i handle initKeyEvent which is deprecated in firefox > 5 ?
[01:37:14] <omid> has jQuery any API to use keyboard events ?
[01:38:26] <thinkclay> {-_-\\\: yes, what do you need help with re: animate()?
[01:38:59] <{-_-\\\> thinkclay: i need to animate 1 class of body to another class
[01:39:25] <{-_-\\\> i.e. $('body').animate({class:'sexystylebody'},300);
[01:39:32] <Cork> omid: api?, for what
[01:39:32] <{-_-\\\> which will change all elements inside
[01:39:50] <Cork> omid: you mean like shortcuts or what=
[01:39:52] <Cork> *?
[01:40:22] <thinkclay> {-_-\\\: well you cant animate classes per se, but you can animate specific properties while add/remove class names simultaneously
[01:40:35] <{-_-\\\> aren't there any plugins for class animate?
[01:40:47] <{-_-\\\> it can just get css from source class and dest class and animate them
[01:40:49] <{-_-\\\> sounds simple
[01:41:01] <Cork> its part of jquery-ui
[01:41:06] <{-_-\\\> i just want styles on my website to be changeable via ajax and js
[01:41:14] <{-_-\\\> even without ajax
[01:41:20] <{-_-\\\> Cork: oh? how can i use it?
[01:41:46] <thinkclay> http://jqueryui.com/demos/addClass/
[01:41:52] <Cork> you can animate through addClass/removeClass
[01:41:57] <Cork> among other
[01:42:44] <omid> Cork : i want to replace characters while user is typing into a textfield
[01:43:08] <{-_-\\\> Cork: this won't be smooth
[01:43:13] <{-_-\\\> i need smooth animation
[01:43:19] <{-_-\\\> i know i can just change classes
[01:43:33] <Cork> won't be smooth?
[01:43:54] <Cork> it will be as smooth as the browsers gc allow
[01:44:57] <{-_-\\\> Cork: by smooth i mean gradiently changing everything
[01:45:01] <{-_-\\\> not instantly
[01:45:32] <{-_-\\\> if i change body class, then i want to see it changes color gradiently, font sizes, elements moving to different positions, etc
[01:45:39] <{-_-\\\> not instantly
[01:45:40] <omid> i was wondering if jQuery has a solution for this bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=622245 ?
[01:45:55] <Cork> {-_-\\\: that is what jquery-ui adds
[01:46:03] <Cork> it should gradually change things
[01:46:11] <Cork> with a few exceptions
[01:46:23] <{-_-\\\> so how can i gradiently change class of body?
[01:46:36] <xec> lol
[01:46:52] <thinkclay> {-_-\\\: Did you even look at the demo on that link?
[01:47:06] <{-_-\\\> not yet
[01:47:17] <{-_-\\\> i don't have time at the moment, i will look later
[01:47:32] <thinkclay> take a look, i'm pretty sure it's what you want and will solve your problem
[01:47:41] <{-_-\\\> later
[01:48:22] <thinkclay> Anyone in here work with the GMAP3 plugin at all?
[02:11:27] <sorush20_> this is a general permissions question. What should the permissions be for the pdf files on this page for it not to give me an error like forbidden?
[02:12:57] <sorush20_> dont' worry I sorted it
[02:15:40] <LightMonk> hey =) (new to jquery) Have a problem with the datepicker altFormat, it doesen't seem working for me...
[02:15:48] <LightMonk> Java: $(document).ready(function () {     $(function () {         $('#datepicker').datepicker({ altFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });     }); });
[02:15:54] <molavy> how can i detect when user manually resize textarea
[02:16:31] <LightMonk> he sill Outputs dd/mm/yy
[02:16:33] <molavy> i created textarea on fly and use live
[02:20:22] <xec> LightMonk: i haven't used the datepicker before.. but you seem to have two sets of document ready handlers nested inside eachother, $(function(){...}) is the same as $(document).ready(function(){...})
[02:21:04] <sgronblo> When was jsonp support added to jquery?
[02:21:17] <xec> LightMonk: also, Java is something quite different from JavaScript ;)
[02:21:56] <molavy> any idea?
[02:22:27] <xec> molavy: i dont think the native resize event will trigger, maybe try something like: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/
[02:22:29] <LightMonk> hm...removed it, but still just Outputting mm/dd/yy and not yy-mm-dd (yeah...i mean JavaScript^^ )
[02:23:59] <xec> LightMonk: try dateFormat rather than altFormat
[02:26:06] <LightMonk> THX! but for what is altFormat good for? O.o RTFM doesn't seems to be working here^^
[02:26:49] <molavy> can i use simulate it using  mouse up and mousedown key
[02:27:13] <xec> altFormat appears to be for formatting the display of the date while still keeping the original format sent off
[02:27:17] <molavy> ?
[02:29:48] <LightMonk> you mean the date value looks like 'mm/dd/yy' but will be displayed as in dateformat setted: "dd-mm-yy" ?
[02:30:52] <xec> i mean dateFormat is for setting dateformat (both sent and displayed) while you can override *display only* with altFormat -- if i understand the manual correctly
[02:31:19] <xec> but like i said, i have never used it ;)
[02:34:08] <DRSK> jsfiddle down?
[02:34:16] <DRSK> nvm, just slow for me atm.
[02:35:44] <xec> lol what is bot-t up to
[02:41:07] <LightMonk> Another Question, but to ajax^^ : I have changed the version of the jquery-js from v1.4.2 to v1.6.2 and suddenly i didn't got my JSON back from my webservices (they work just fine with the older version) read about that it works if i upload it on a webserver, but was there some changes to it? (sry for bad english)
[02:41:11] <NodeX> has anyone or does anyone know of a port of livequery that listens for new elements and fires a function when inserted into the DOM which will save me writing one
[02:41:27] <NodeX> ?demo @ LightMonk
[02:41:28] <bot-t> LightMonk, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[02:56:22] <flu1> hey all! im new to jquery im sure this is a simple question ;) —> how can i write smthn like this (with selectors) without children() / parent() — > $(':parent>ul>li>a.current',this)
[02:56:59] <SaadIbrahim> hey guys
[02:57:06] <SaadIbrahim> i am looking for a certain kind of slider
[02:57:11] <SaadIbrahim> can anyone help me
[02:57:40] <Cork> flu1: you can't
[02:57:49] <Cork> css doens't provide a way to do parent selection
[02:58:21] <superos> Is it possible to listen to class changes for an element? I got an element that gets a new class after an ajax request is finished processing. How can I listen for that class change? I want to listen for that class change in order to add another class to another element on the page.
[02:58:21] <Cork> ?ask @ SaadIbrahim
[02:58:22] <bot-t> SaadIbrahim, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:58:49] <SaadIbrahim> can anyone help me: page loads.. a sider starts playing... assume it has four slides.. when it reaches the fourth slide.. it starts from the first slide for the next slider... there are four different sliders... and there are buttons to change slider at bottom too + next previous buttons
[02:58:49] <Cork> superos: you can listen for domchange, but its not implemented in all browsers
[02:59:20] <sorush20_> can anyone see any pdf file here http://www.sadafnazari.com/www.rsp2000.com/cosmophobia_pdf.php
[02:59:49] <SaadIbrahim> screenshot: http://snpr.cm/ViHpNc.jpg
[02:59:57] <SaadIbrahim> so its like group of slides
[02:59:59] <superos> Cork: Any pointers to that?
[03:00:43] <ravenzz> SaadIbrahim can't you use tabs ?
[03:01:06] <SaadIbrahim> no because when one slider is finished other has to load automatically
[03:01:16] <Cork> ?mdc DOMSubtreeModified @ superos
[03:01:20] <SaadIbrahim> it has to shift to other tab
[03:01:22] <ravenzz> if (lastslide) > switch tab
[03:01:30] <Cork> <_<
[03:01:36] <superos> Cork: Thanks
[03:01:50] <Cork> superos: looks like there isn't a page for it :D
[03:01:57] <ukim> Hi. Can someone give me advices please? I wrote a small fragment of code: http://pastie.org/2787040 It works fine. But i want to know, what my logic and stylistic errors? Is there any better approach to do the same thing? What is the best practices?
[03:02:12] <Cork> but thats the only event there is, but its still a draft so not well supported
[03:02:21] <superos> Cork: I am looking into this thread http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2712124/jquery-listen-to-changes-within-a-div-and-act-accordingly
[03:03:01] <blackspotwiggins> superos, the idea is, you are changing the class yourself. you dont need to make a custom event and trigger it manually, just call whatever you need
[03:03:26] <ravenzz> SaadIbrahim http://flex.madebymufffin.com/ you have end: (Fires when the slider reaches the last slide (asynchronous))
[03:03:49] <LightMonk> hm...does anyone have VB 2010 to test my ajax problem? Don't think i can post .aspx and VB on http://jsfiddle.net/ . Would try to Upload it anywere
[03:04:52] <LightMonk> or VB 2008? =)
[03:09:41] <LightMonk> Here: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=F2FA3RFW Can anyone look  why i dont get back my JSON or rather why it dosn't want to write the String into the div
[03:11:15] <LightMonk> in FF it says that it posted a JSON and got the JSON back
[03:12:10] <ravenzz> LightMonk fixingthesejquery.com
[03:14:49] <LightMonk> well... it works with jquery 1.4.2 why not in 1.6.2????????
[03:15:32] <LightMonk> and i use FireBug, and it says that he got the JSON back
[03:15:42] <NodeX> ?closest

[03:17:06] <Guest96632> any idea to implement set-timeout in a for loop ?
[03:17:56] <padolsey> Guest96632: What have you tried?
[03:18:46] <Guest96632> padolsey: var status = setTimeout(function (){},30000)
[03:18:51] <LightMonk> Don't see how closest can help me here...
[03:19:21] <xec> Guest96632: what did it do, and what did you expect it to do?
[03:19:21] <Aldus> a customer of mine needs a website to have a field (or similar) to input hand-made signatures through ipad / iphones (handwritten with a stylus). Is this possible yet with jQuery ?
[03:19:41] <padolsey> Guest96632: ok, it should work in a for-loop, but dependent on what variables you want `function(){}` to use, u may have to use a closure
[03:20:36] <padolsey> Aldus: It is possible with SVG or CANVAS, but I would be worried about what functionality would fallback to when a user has an older browser of JS disabled...
[03:21:03] <Aldus> padolsey, this will only be used with an iPad, is a software specific for it
[03:21:09] <Guest96632> padolsey:Thanks, if possible pls brief it little more.
[03:21:28] <mathi> hi
[03:21:31] <padolsey> Aldus: Research canvas or svg then.
[03:21:36] <Aldus> padolsey, ok thanks
[03:22:03] <mathi> How do I take the parent div of "this" ? (parent div which has a class "expose")
[03:22:57] <Cork> $(this).closest('div.expose')
[03:23:18] <padolsey> mathi: so, not a parent, an ancestor.
[03:24:10] <mathi> right :) thanks
[03:24:40] <sgronblo> Does jquery try to guess any datatypes based on urls and extensions?
[03:24:59] <mathi> and then in this ancestor div I need to find a div which has the class expose-full. is this a good way to do it? (this).closest('div.expose').find('div.expose-full')
[03:25:20] <sgronblo> Like if you were to make a request for an xml doc to a different site would jquery understand the datatype has to be jsonp xml for it to work?
[03:25:21] <Cork> sgronblo: no, no need for that, its mandatory for the server to send a content-type
[03:25:38] <padolsey> mathi: Yup, that should work, although `(this)` whould probs be `$(this)`
[03:25:56] <Guest96632> padolsey: I have to upload around 10000 files of each 30 mb in a batch. while listing this files, getting js irresponsive error so i though to put delay after some records so all files get listted.
[03:26:21] <padolsey> sgronblo: You would have to specify dataType JSONP, along with a `callback=?` param which tells jQuery to take care of the JSONP callback  (AFAIK)
[03:26:22] <Cork> sgronblo: and jqonp can't be used for xml, only json as its basically a script tag loading a js file
[03:26:26] <mathi> padolsey, actually this div (expose-full) is on the sale level as $(this). maybe I don't need to go to ancestor then get the child
[03:26:32] <mathi> *same level
[03:26:48] <gavimobile> I would like to apply auto resize for my modal/dialog when page is resized. could someone fix this for me please? http://pastebin.com/SBNRDg6Z
[03:27:19] <padolsey> mathi: Ahh, it's a sibling :D ... It's really up to you, - I would propably do `$(this).parent().find('.expose-full`)`
[03:28:10] <mathi> padolsey, yea, but I was thinking that $(this).closest('div.expose').find('div.expose-full') is more "flexible" and extensible actually. cause if I add some divs it won't hurt
[03:28:18] <padolsey> Guest96632: What exactly are you usign JavaScript for?
[03:28:34] <SaadIbrahim> hey ravenzz.. thanks man.. really appreciate it... but i need two functionalities.. change tab when last slider... and start palying when that tab shows
[03:28:43] <padolsey> mathi: Good point -- I guess it's less likely to break if anything changes.
[03:28:53] <LightMonk> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=F2FA3RFW v1.6.2 doesn't work, v1.4.2 does! Why? Is my datafilter: incorrect?
[03:29:08] <LightMonk> is aspx/vb programming
[03:29:46] <Guest96632> padolsey: I am using "jQuery-File-Upload" "https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload"
[03:33:21] <padolsey> Guest96632: I don't think uploading 10000x30mb files is the right job for HTTP and a web interface. Why don't u use FTP/SFTP?
[03:38:30] <Guest96632> padolsey: ok, but can we upload concurrent file in ftp/sftp?
[03:39:03] <gavimobile> sorry for the repost, I really need a hand here. I am trying to apply an auto resize for my modal/dialog when page is resized with zoom in/zoom out. could someone fix my code so it can work properly ? here's my pastebin, its very clean http://pastebin.com/SBNRDg6Z
[03:45:24] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[03:45:55] <Double_Rainbow> anyone can tell me what this ^ is? (0,963 x P^0,48x(T/100)^0,5xA^-0,13)*1000/4,18
[03:46:08] <PERECil> power
[03:53:50] <sgronblo> Where exactly are you supposed to find the data for an ajax call with datatype jsonp?
[03:54:03] <m1d4s> why doesn`t a simple console.log($('#foo_id').val) where foo_id is a id from select return a value ? am i doing sth wrong ?
[03:54:23] <m1d4s> i`m playing around with acebug *
[03:54:44] <Cork> sgronblo: jquery creates a script tag can calls the server the function given is called and its return value is passed from $.ajax
[03:55:05] <Cork> so it should behave just like a normal async call
[03:55:32] <anvandare> m1d4s: val is a function, use $('#foo_id').val()
[03:57:14] <Xotix> Hi, i need help on this: http://tinyw.in/Zzcb How can i wrap my drag target with html.
[03:58:41] <sgronblo> Cork: I didn't really get your point
[03:59:44] <Cork> sgronblo: when you to a jsonp call what happens is that jquery converts your data into params and makes a url_to_target.js?params&callback=function_name
[03:59:59] <Cork> sgronblo: it then puts this in a script tag in the header and waits for the file to loads
[04:00:25] <Cork> sgronblo: when the file is loaded it calls the function assigned (function_name)
[04:00:39] <Cork> and returns the data function_name returns to the success(data) callback
[04:00:58] <Cork> sgronblo: the js file loaded from the server has to define that function name or it won't work
[04:08:45] <LightMonk> Pls can anyone take a look on my little test programm. I get the JSON back and the html-string get writes down into a div wit jquery v1.4.2. It still seems to get the JSON back but doesn't write it down with jquery v1.6.2. alert(response) says null, and calling the error event fails too somehow... -> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UFP99WT0
[04:10:09] <skua> hello   $("#test").load("index.html"); only loads index.html itself and does not load any other local files

[04:13:30] <{-_-\\\> hi
[04:13:39] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to play shoutcast stream with jquery?
[04:13:58] <{-_-\\\> i.e. to fetch with ajax, play with html5 or flash as fallback
[04:14:03] <{-_-\\\> are there any good plugins that do that?
[04:14:47] <skua> test.php ------------------------->

[04:15:37] <skua> apache server
[04:15:47] <skua> but .load doesnt work ...
[04:16:24] <ravenzz> {-_-\\\ take a look at the jw flv player
[04:17:02] <ravenzz> skua next time don't paste your code here
[04:17:08] <ravenzz> ?paste @ skua
[04:17:08] <bot-t> skua, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[04:17:16] <skua> okey
[04:17:19] <skua> sorry
[04:17:35] <skua> any1 got ideas of what could be wrong ?
[04:17:56] <ravenzz> the current version of jquery is 1.6.4
[04:18:01] <{-_-\\\> ravenzz: i need it to be invisible
[04:18:12] <filipiz> skua: try $(document).ready(function(){ $("irc://chat.freenode.net/#test").load("test2.php"); } );
[04:18:15] <{-_-\\\> so user can't find the source of music even with firebug
[04:18:44] <{-_-\\\> filipiz +1
[04:18:50] <ravenzz> {-_-\\\ it is impossible
[04:18:54] <{-_-\\\> ravenzz: why?
[04:20:18] <ravenzz> because when you listen at a station your client enstablish a connection with the shoutcast server
[04:20:59] <filipiz> your way the dom tree was not loaded when the script executed... so it wouldnt find the <div id="test'> and then didnt make any request
[04:21:12] <{-_-\\\> ravenzz: yes, via ajax
[04:21:16] <padolsey> filipiz: what is that supposed to do?
[04:21:56] <{-_-\\\> ravenzz: it can be made to look as regular notification-checking request
[04:22:10] <{-_-\\\> i.e. POST /checkmessages
[04:22:24] <{-_-\\\> in return shoutcast stream will come and be played
[04:22:26] <{-_-\\\> is it possible?
[04:23:36] <filipiz> padolsey: I pasted a line of code that had a hash... my irc client changed it to a URL... but it was suposed to be just (hash)test ... did it answered?
[04:24:46] <ravenzz> {-_-\\\ you want to proxy that?
[04:24:53] <{-_-\\\> maybe
[04:24:54] <skua> 	 $(document).ready(function(){ $("#test").load("test2.php"); } );
[04:25:01] <skua> does nothing
[04:25:17] <ravenzz> you need bandwidth in order to do that
[04:26:02] <filipiz> skua: any javascript errors?
[04:26:07] <{-_-\\\> skylamer`: try $(document).ready(function(){$(this).ready()}).ready();
[04:26:13] <{-_-\\\> skua:
[04:26:45] <ravenzz> anyway the user could use the proxy address to spread the streaming as well
[04:27:14] <skua> no js errors, is there any debugger ?
[04:27:21] <JesperA> lol
[04:27:58] <{-_-\\\> skua: yes, its included in ie6
[04:28:05] <ravenzz> ..
[04:28:07] <LightMonk> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 ? =)
[04:31:03] <filipiz> skua: 1) what browser are u using? 2) if you access test2.php in the browser (normal way) does it print 'test' ?
[04:31:50] <LightMonk> I don't  want to be a Helper Vampire but i really have no clue anymore on my Problem and how i can debug it -.-' I really go mad here:
[04:31:51] <LightMonk> [12:08] <LightMonk> Pls can anyone take a look on my little test programm. I get the JSON back and the html-string get writes down into a div wit jquery v1.4.2. It still seems to get the JSON back but doesn't write it down with jquery v1.6.2. alert(response) says null, and calling the error event fails too somehow... -> http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UFP99WT0
[04:35:03] <{-_-\\\> LightMonk: maybe you are doing something wrong
[04:35:22] <skua> filipiz yes i can access them both $URL/test.php, but simply jquery does not work
[04:35:27] <skua> and the code is correct
[04:35:39] <LightMonk> i updated the jquery script?! O.o
[04:36:07] <filipiz> skua: what browser are u using?
[04:36:16] <Xotix> If i specify a helper for start event for draggable and drop it into a sortable. Is this just what i see when i drag it around but not the thing which gets added at drop?
[04:36:40] <skua> i use ff, opera and chrome
[04:36:46] <skua> same results on all of them
[04:36:55] <filipiz> instead of test2.php try to add the entire url...
[04:37:08] <ravenzz> skua can you provide a live demo?
[04:42:28] <dangerousdave>  hi, any idea why $(this).find("div p.child_name").toggle(); finds the element, but $(this).find("li div p.child_name").toggle(); does not? and yes, the div is within an li, the latter rule is how it is being styled with css.
[04:43:20] <padolsey> dangerousdave: What does `$(this)` refer to? The LI element?
[04:44:35] <skua> ravenzz

[04:44:46] <skua> http://www.myewood.com/test2.php
[04:44:57] <dangerousdave> padolsey: yes, thanks, i see the problem now :-)
[04:45:26] <skua> $(document).ready(function(){ $("#test").load("test2.php"); } ); does not work as well
[04:51:16] <LightMonk> I don't get it... -.-' My datafilter is doing it right by both jqueryversions...
[04:52:01] <LightMonk> it parses it to d=[1] { d[0] = <h1>Hello World</h1> }
[04:52:25] <LightMonk> but by v1.6.2 the response gives null back
[04:54:23] <LightMonk> --> js : http://jsfiddle.net/TEXJj/
[04:56:31] <dddbmt> If I want to change the source of an iframe (embedded youtube). Is it enough to do $('#iframe').attr('src', 'new-url'); ? Will that refresh properly?
[04:56:45] <ravenzz> yeo

[04:56:57] <dddbmt> Thank you ravenzz! :)
[04:58:14] <NodeX> anyone know if it's possible to call $(this) in the context of it's current document .. for example if I was in an iframe the context would be different to outside it
[05:06:30] <skua> hey, somebody please check my demo http://www.myewood.com/test.php
[05:06:38] <skua> code seems to be correct
[05:06:41] <skua> but it doesnt work
[05:08:48] <xec> skua: indeed, running the code manually through console works
[05:08:58] <bonhoffer> i've got a function that is available on every page but only runs on one page -- my js is throwing an error because this function references a variable that is defined on this one page - ideas?
[05:09:46] <bonhoffer> for example foo.html has <script> var d = 1 </script> the code has the line alert d in a function that doesn't run on any other page
[05:10:10] <bonhoffer> even though that function isn't called, the browser still throws an error
[05:12:13] <skua> so whats the reason for in not working then
[05:14:21] <bonhoffer> skua: the code works fine when d_data is defined, but on other pages js is expecting that value to be there
[05:14:44] <bonhoffer> even though the code has a if $('#some_div') before it -- so the code shouldn't be running
[05:15:30] <bonhoffer> so here is the ugly thing -- i have a <script javascript> var d_data = 'foo' </> on the page that is defining the variable, and the function is just pulling it in
[05:16:22] <bonhoffer> so i'm using a global variable -- i know this is non-standard, but my page needs to load specific values while my big js function is available to all pages
[05:16:44] <bonhoffer> sorry, this is really a js question not jquery . . .
[05:21:58] <molavy> how can i select part of string at textarea
[05:22:15] <LightMonk> does anyone get a clue where my problem/failure is? JS:http://jsfiddle.net/TEXJj/     full test programm: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UFP99WT0 Filter is parsing in $.ajaxsetup but in v1.6.2 the response gets null....
[05:22:17] <molavy> i want highlight part of text at textarea
[05:23:07] <molavy> what happend? what happend for logs
[05:25:47] <ssadsd> hie
[05:25:58] <ssadsd> <html> <head> <script typr="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js"></script>  <script type="text/javascript">  $(document).ready(function(){ function showUser(str) {     $.get("getplayer1.php",{Name:str},          function(output) {               $["#statistics"].html(output).show(); }         );  }  }); </script>     </head> <body> <center> <h1>Player Stats  </h1> </center></br> <form 
[05:26:21] <ssadsd> can anybody find any error in that code
[05:26:26] <ssadsd> its not wrking
[05:26:34] <xec> ssadsd: use jsfiddle.net for pasting code please
[05:27:18] <xec> also "its not working" isnt very helpful ;) what is your code supposed to do, and what happens instead?
[05:28:15] <LightMonk> http://jsfiddle.net/TEXJj/ my code gives a null in response if I'm using jquery1.6.2 instead of jquery 1.4.2 -.-'
[05:28:16] <ssadsd> it should load a row from database
[05:28:25] <xec> also, you might want $("#statistics") rather than $["#statistics"] ...
[05:28:34] <ssadsd> but instead nthing is happening

[05:29:02] <Ch4rAzZz> hi, I have application with multiple windows, which can be open, close etc. My problem is that everything you in my app is just ajax-call, there's no refresh between and when I use some jQuery plugin it doesn't work with multiple windows. I tried to use livequery plugin, but it doesn't help. How to achieve multiple ajax-calls?
[05:29:59] <xec> ssadsd: ignore the .live() reference ;)
[05:30:06] <NodeX> Your question doesn't make sense Ch4rAzZz
[05:32:05] <ssadsd> http://jsfiddle.net/kalyaniitkgp/B2Txm/1/
[05:32:17] <ssadsd> xec:
[05:32:32] <LightMonk> http://jsfiddle.net/TEXJj/ Why gives my return msg.d that should return 	Object { d=[1]} 	 d 	["<h1>Hello World!</h1>"] 	 0 	"<h1>Hello World!</h1>"    but i get an "null" by response ?
[05:33:09] <ssadsd> i uploaded the php code in html and jquery code in javascript
[05:33:14] <xec> ssadsd: can you tidy it up a bit? now you have html in the javascript field and php(??) in the html field
[05:33:28] <ssadsd> where can i keep php script
[05:33:33] <ssadsd> no option there
[05:34:00] <xec> ssadsd: you don't. did you try what i suggested?
[05:34:09] <xec> ssadsd:  you might want $("#statistics") rather than $["#statistics"] ...
[05:35:08] <Ch4rAzZz> NodeX, in my app there are just ajax call - every link you click render some partial mostly via $.get. And when I have than multiple instances of for example msDropDown select(it's just simple jQuery plugin), than the second one doesn't work. And same problem is nearly with every new jQuery plugin...
[05:35:11] <Deele> LightMonk, are you sure, you want to use Mootools, not jQuery?
[05:35:25] <ssadsd> xec: nope itdoesnt  wrked
[05:36:05] <ssadsd> xec: u mean instead of calling the function,using event handler like button.click?
[05:36:22] <LightMonk> I'm using jquery sure...but i just dumped  the JavaScript ther cause the rest is an aspx and a webservice.... here full test programm: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UFP99WT0
[05:36:48] <LightMonk> test it once with v1.4.2 (works) and 1.6.2 (doesn't work)
[05:36:51] <xec> ssadsd: did you notice parenthesis instead of square brackets?
[05:37:04] <ssadsd> yeah
[05:37:13] <Deele> LightMonk, I mean, on jsfiddle, additionally, you should supply valid url not webserviceajaxtest
[05:37:38] <xec> ssadsd: and yes, onchange="" in html is considered bad practice, all your javascript should ideally be in seperate javascript files
[05:37:38] <ssadsd> xec:
[05:38:20] <xec> you could do something like $("select").change(function(){...}) instead
[05:38:44] <ssadsd> xec: let me try
[05:38:55] <LightMonk> I well..i have no possibilitys to give a Webservice URL for you guys, thats why i uploaded the full project: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=UFP99WT0
[05:39:34] <LightMonk> the test proect ;-)
[05:39:41] <LightMonk> *project
[05:40:00] <xec> ssadsd: also, you now have showUser function defined inside of document ready function, which means it will be out of scope
[05:40:05] <Deele> LightMonk, better search someone with free time working on your projects :)
[05:40:28] <LightMonk> the problem is, no one here has a clue why it doesn't work xD
[05:41:05] <Deele> I have a clue for you, noone wants to set up specific environment, do 10+ steps, before being able to reproduce your problem
[05:41:18] <LightMonk> i mean...it works with jquery 1.4.2 the parsing is correct but i get a damn null by using 1.6.2 ?!
[05:41:33] <Deele> this is not project helpers channel, this is jquery channel
[05:42:24] <xec> ssadsd: http://jsfiddle.net/KJc5W/
[05:42:46] <ssadsd> http://jsfiddle.net/kalyaniitkgp/B2Txm/3/
[05:44:07] <xec> ssadsd: what is "fom.users.value" ?
[05:44:42] <ssadsd> srry spelling mistake
[05:44:53] <ssadsd> form.users.value
[05:45:47] <ssadsd> http://jsfiddle.net/kalyaniitkgp/B2Txm/4/
[05:46:06] <ssadsd> i updated it but still not getting any output
[05:46:21] <ssadsd> xec:
[05:46:43] <xec> where is form defined? anyway, did you see my example? you can use $(this).val() or this.value inside the change event.
[05:46:52] <xec> also; $("select[name="users"]") ??
[05:49:21] <bonhoffer> i tried to write up my question here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7953923/pass-javascript-data-from-view-into-coffeescript-function
[05:49:36] <bonhoffer> on how to get data into a js file
[05:49:40] <LightMonk> now no one can say you have 10+ steps with this: http://www.megaupload.com/?d=4JWR0UZL click, download, unzip, open with VS, run!
[05:50:16] <ssadsd> xec:  http://jsfiddle.net/kalyaniitkgp/B2Txm/5/
[05:50:26] <ssadsd> i updated still no output
[05:50:40] <ssadsd> xec: please look into my php file once
[05:50:54] <ssadsd> i checked the database its working
[05:51:17] <ssadsd> so there must be problem with the .get method
[05:51:21] <Deele> ssadsd, dont use <html> format for jsfiddle
[05:51:23] <xec> ssadsd: I can't help you with php, but you didnt fix the double quotes
[05:51:45] <Peeter> Is there something equivalent of PHPs array_values for Javascript Obejcts?
[05:51:45] <xec> ssadsd: try $('select[name="users"]') instead of $("select[name="users"]")
[05:51:54] <Deele> there is a field for <body> contents, there is a field for <script> contents, and field for <style> contents, there is onLoad jQuery on left side of screen
[05:52:11] <Deele> ssadsd ^
[05:52:33] <ssadsd> deele no space for php
[05:52:45] <Deele> ssadsd, ofcourse
[05:52:57] <ssadsd> but my code is in php
[05:52:57] <Deele> you need to make your code work, without PHP
[05:53:02] <Peeter> Is there something equivalent of PHPs array_values for Javascript Obejcts? http://pastebin.com/9Cn1ApXh
[05:53:19] <Deele> ssadsd, you make a .php file on your server, and give a link inside jsfiddle to it
[05:53:21] <ssadsd> can it connect to database
[05:53:31] <xec> ssadsd: no
[05:56:21] <Deele> why do theese people even try lifting PHP&jQuery, without basic knowlage of HTML
[05:56:30] <xec> ssadsd: fixed up whitespace, removed the onchange="" html : http://jsfiddle.net/B2Txm/6/
[05:57:20] <xec> ssadsd: now it tries to get "getplayer1.php?Name=Virender+Sehwag" for instance, is this what you wanted?
[05:57:38] <ssadsd> yes
[05:57:59] <xec> ssadsd: if you have firebug, fire up the console
[05:58:14] <ssadsd> wheres the whitespace
[05:58:34] <ssadsd> fre up the console?
[05:58:39] <ssadsd> *fire
[05:58:41] <xec> whitespace is spaces, newlines and tabs - your code was messy
[05:58:51] <xec> do you have firebug?
[05:58:56] <ssadsd> nope
[05:59:04] <xec> what browser are you using
[05:59:12] <ssadsd> chrome
[05:59:19] <Deele> F12
[06:00:05] <xec> like Deele says, open the chrome inspector and click on console
[06:00:26] <Deele> xec, note: it wont work on jsfiddle
[06:00:38] <Deele> as it is iframe based
[06:00:49] <xec> sure it will
[06:00:55] <xec> it will display ajax gets
[06:01:04] <Deele> all jsfiddle objects and errors are inside that iframe
[06:01:14] <xec> whenever you select another player
[06:01:32] <xec> you will see what url it tries to get and the error you get back
[06:01:40] <Deele> you should use jQuery (edge) and check "Firebug Lite" checkbox :)
[06:02:24] <alex88> is possible to animate css3 rotation without using plugins?
[06:02:25] <xec> that works too
[06:02:58] <gnarf> alex88: no
[06:03:14] <gnarf> alex88: you need a cssHook / animation step function
[06:03:36] <alex88> gnarf: ok thank you... something like this http://plugins.jquery.com/files/rotate.js__0.txt ?
[06:04:34] <gnarf> https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks @alex88 i think thats the lib i used for the transform hooks
[06:04:36] <xec> you could just use css3 animations?
[06:04:55] <xec> alas, not backwards compatible with older browsers
[06:05:13] <gnarf> ahh wait
[06:05:14] <gnarf> here it is
[06:05:14] <gnarf> https://github.com/louisremi/jquery.transform.js
[06:05:31] <gnarf> but yeah, i mean, anything that supports it prolly supports animations
[06:05:45] <alex88> gnarf: uh great, thank you :D
[06:06:18] <gnarf> alex88: so css3 animation is probably your "best" bet
[06:07:02] <alex88> yeh, that's the easiest way
[06:08:59] <Xotix> Can someone explain me technically how draggble with sortabel works. Like, when i drop it, it takes the stuff from event.target and puts it there, the visible stuff i drag is the helper. They are not connected etc. Is that correct?
[06:09:05] <e6nian> I can't bind any more event's on the page using jquery with bind/live/delegate.. Even on the chrome console.
[06:09:29] <e6nian> what would be the problem?
[06:09:58] <xec> e6nian: do you have a live url?
[06:10:15] <e6nian> xec: what's a live url?
[06:10:24] <xec> an url to a live demo of your issue
[06:10:33] <xec> hard to guess what might be causing it
[06:10:38] <e6nian> xec: showoff.relife.me
[06:12:52] <xec> thats quite a few javascript files o.O
[06:13:11] <e6nian> xec: yep, totally a mess there
[06:14:46] <xec> a bit too much for me to wrap my head around i'm afraid ;)
[06:15:32] <e6nian> xec: me too.
[06:16:23] <nicolaes> anyone uses MediaPlugin? I feel there's a trick with Attachment's beforeSave() method, because the files are not checked for errors anymore
[06:16:57] <nicolaes> whops.. sry wrong channel :)
[06:21:14] <skua> any ideas why this not working? http://www.myewood.com/test.php
[06:24:39] <hazamonzo__> Hey folks. This should find each td within a div called c1 with the css class called myClass right? $("#c1").find("tbody tr td.myClass").each(function(){
[06:26:23] <RandalSchwartz> don't need the find
[06:26:33] <RandalSchwartz> $("#c1 tbody tr td.myClass")
[06:26:52] <RandalSchwartz> I'd leave out the tbody and tr though
[06:26:59] <RandalSchwartz> simpler :)
[06:27:08] <hazamonzo__> RandalSchwartz: Worth a shot :)
[06:29:48] <alex88> gna, i'm  using that plugin, i've the following js http://pastebin.com/aMwq9x6c the object starts 45deg clockwise, but after fadein, rotate, fadeout it doesn't go back to 45deg... still at -90 as the animate function does
[06:30:05] <alex88> gnarf: last msg was for you, tab didn't autocomplete :D
[06:30:51] <aaronmcadam> anyone using the jasmine gem?
[06:32:38] <alex88> maybe you can't apply css to a non visible object?
[06:32:52] <alex88> seems wrong to me
[06:34:06] <james13433> This isnt a jquery question but, mabey someone can help, the javascript channel just ignored me. I have element and I need to go inside that and find a radio button inside it and disable it, How would I do thaat?
[06:35:58] <juha_> james13433: in jQuery, $("element").find("input[type='radio']").attr("disabled", "disabled");
[06:36:18] <james13433> Needs to be jusst javascript juha_
[06:36:54] <Xotix> How can i wrap an element when start dragging? I need to wrap it with an tr and a td but i don't get it
[06:37:06] <ravenzz> juha_ at least you should provide your markup

[06:47:20] <bonhoffer> ravenzz: so my getJSON function is returning an Object, but i can't get any data out of it (it has abort: always: complete: done: error:)
[06:48:18] <ravenzz> ?ftj @ bonhoffer
[06:48:18] <bot-t> bonhoffer, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[06:48:19] <bonhoffer> i just want to put the json into an Object, do i need to define the data function?
[06:48:53] <Xotix> Can someone help me here pleaseè i really stuck on that since ages. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7930747/wrap-my-dragged-target
[06:48:57] <RandalSchwartz> bonhoffer - yes, you have to get the data async
[06:49:04] <RandalSchwartz> so you have to define a callback for when the data has returned
[06:49:14] <RandalSchwartz> that function will continue whatever processing you want
[06:49:14] <bonhoffer> ravenzz: well, thanks for the links -- i guess my question doesn't make sense, but i'd be up for an example where someone pulls in a json file via ajax
[06:49:38] <alex88> if i want to do a loop of animations, and let user select how many times do it, including unlimited, i used a do{}while but if i set to unlimited it keeps loading like it's looping... which is the right way to queue animations only after one finished?
[06:49:41] <bonhoffer> RandalSchwartz: odd, so that is an optional parameter, wonder when it wouldn't be used
[06:49:45] <xec> bonhoffer: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:50:21] <xec> bonhoffer: the data returned will only be available in the success handler
[06:50:22] <bonhoffer> xec:  on that page now, but they use the data for alert functions, they do not load it in . . . i'll keep hunting at it
[06:50:49] <xec> bonhoffer: the alert is inside the success handler function
[06:50:50] <bonhoffer> xec: so what is that default Object that gets loaded?
[06:50:55] <ravenzz> bonhoffer place a console.debug(data) instead of the allert
[06:51:04] <ravenzz> and take a look at your browser's console
[06:51:07] <xec> bonhoffer: http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jqXHR
[06:51:21] <molavy> how can i highlight part of text in textarea
[06:51:27] <kborchers> bonhoffer: if you say something like var x = $.getJSON(... x will be the jqxhr
[06:51:32] <kborchers> read further down on that page
[06:51:45] <bonhoffer> d_data = $.getJSON('http://www.mysite.us/district_data/happy.json'); <- ah, so this is a jqXHR type, got it
[06:52:34] <xec> bonhoffer: yes, and then you can do d_data.done(function(data){ /* got dataz here */ })
[06:52:48] <kborchers> bonhoffer: right ... you can use the jqxhr to then get at your data, otherwise you can define your success callback as a parameter and handle the data there
[06:54:39] <bonhoffer> very helpful, so now i just need to figure out how to get that data into one variable -- this worked so well when i just rendered the file var data = <%= render :file => "myfile.json" %>, then data had exactly what i wanted, ajax is less clear
[06:55:01] <bonhoffer> i'll keep reading the docs and get how to use the function to do that
[06:55:45] <bonhoffer> i guess i just do one function(data) { var the_data = data } and i might be good to go
[06:57:18] <kborchers> bonhoffer: why would you just do something like  var json_data; $.getJSON(url, function(data, textStatus, jqXHR){ json_data = data;});
[06:57:24] <bonhoffer> so i really shouldn't be assigning d_data = $.getJSON( . . .) seems the wrong way to thing about this
[06:57:44] <bonhoffer> kborchers: that is my plan
[06:58:13] <bonhoffer> kborchers: but why do i need function(data, textStatus, jqXHR)? not just function(data)
[06:58:38] <kborchers> bonhoffer: function(data) will work ... that's just the full signature
[06:58:55] <bonhoffer> got it
[06:58:57] <kborchers> bonhoffer: you just have to keep in mind that getJSON is async so json_data will most likely be empty immediately after the getJSON call
[06:59:13] <kborchers> so it may be better to do what you plan to do with that data inside the success callback
[06:59:42] <bonhoffer> ok, so put the whole script in there?
[07:00:09] <kborchers> depends on how your script is written and when you need the data see ?ajax101
[07:00:09] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[07:01:10] <bonhoffer> kborchers: thanks so much -- trying now
[07:02:41] <bonhoffer> new wrinkle -- OPTIONS http://www.polco.us/district_data/VA08.json 401 (Unauthorized)
[07:02:50] <nFFF> Any pluging/open source version of this sort of pdf reader:  http://issuu.com/tomcreedon/docs/user-guide
[07:03:00] <bonhoffer> so i have this site behind http security, but i've logged in
[07:03:32] <bonhoffer> is it that i am developing locally: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.polco.us/district_data/VA08.json. Origin http://localhost:3000 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[07:03:51] <bonhoffer> if i click on that link -- the json downloads no problem
[07:04:25] <kborchers> ?sop @ bonhoffer
[07:04:26] <bot-t> bonhoffer, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[07:04:54] <bonhoffer> hmm. . . so this should work in production, but not in development
[07:05:17] <kborchers> so, yes ... you need to pull a copy of the json to your local environment while developing to conform to sop
[07:07:15] <bonhoffer> kborchers: thanks!
[07:07:20] <kborchers> np
[07:07:52] <meancandy> o/ i got a question to an ajax call with post
[07:08:10] <nFFF> anyone?
[07:08:49] <meancandy> fiddle -> http://jsfiddle.net/aLDNH/ i get the result in the console but its not parsed to the callback function...
[07:09:36] <bonhoffer> works, well, is there a way for the jquery to find the hostname so i can write my script to test for environment
[07:09:42] <bonhoffer> or put the hostname in the url?
[07:11:05] <bonhoffer> pathArray = window.location.pathname.split( '/' ); host = pathArray[2];
[07:13:04] <spersaud> whats the simplest jquery drop down menu ?
[07:13:14] <spersaud> !drop down menu
[07:15:14] <meancandy> http://jsfiddle.net/aLDNH/1/ -> basically all i need is the json_encoded response in the vars so i can work with
[07:15:14] <{-_-\\\> spersaud: $('menudiv').click(function(){$('div.sub',this).toggle();});
[07:17:24] <kborchers> meancandy: most likely, your server is not sending back application/json as the data type, you should use $.ajax instead of post. there you can specify the dataType option as json and it should work
[07:17:46] <kborchers> you may also try making sure your server is sending back application/json as the data type
[07:17:50] <meancandy> 			echo json_encode(array("rootIDs"=>$changeroots,"shipIDS"=>$changeships));
[07:17:56] <meancandy> is what gets parsed
[07:18:03] <{-_-\\\> is it possible to write virtual machine in jquery?
[07:18:14] <{-_-\\\> how complicated is it?
[07:18:22] <spersaud>  {-_-\\\ I like that ... very simple .. let me try it
[07:18:38] <kborchers> meancandy: right, but if your server doesn't tell your app that it is sending json, it will probably be parsed as text
[07:19:02] <meancandy> ah okay
[07:19:11] <meancandy> my console shows this: {"rootIDs":[3,2,1],"shipIDS":[13,14,15,16,17,18]}
[07:22:33] <meancandy> and in the header it says Content-Type	application/json
[07:24:57] <bLUEE> hi there
[07:25:36] <bLUEE> i am trying to select all the div's with the class blogPost from the response, but this only seems to select the first one: $(".blogPost", response).html()
[07:26:31] <dethkrieg> If I have a javascript Object, the key is a pointer to an object, correct? So myObject.name = myOldObject.name is a pointer. How do I instead, copy the value from myOldObject.name so that if it changes, the new one doesn't change as well?
[07:27:08] <javaNovice> someone know java here? http://pastebin.com/2xUd6pLV
[07:27:28] <javaNovice> i want the menu to appear when i run the program
[07:27:45] <meancandy> @kborchers: is this syntax correct then? http://jsfiddle.net/aLDNH/2/
[07:28:37] <dethkrieg> javaNovice, run menu() at the top of your main
[07:29:09] <anvandare> and return the choice
[07:29:17] <dethkrieg> oh yeah, return the choice
[07:29:30] <NaBro> @bLUEE wouldn't you want to use .each() or .map() depending on what you want to do with each div?
[07:29:48] <kborchers> meancandy: looks ok, except that you don't have dataType: 'json' but that shouldn't be necessary if the server is passing back application/json
[07:30:01] <bLUEE> NaBro, i just wanted to select them all and append to some other div :/
[07:30:36] <kborchers> meancandy: if you still have issues, you could always try parseJSON on data and see if that works see ?parseJSON

[07:31:10] <meancandy> kborhcers: ok thanks. 1 more question: do i need the intIndex in the click function at the very top ?
[07:32:27] <meancandy> bot-t: okay thanks but i didnt even get the response at all to work

[07:32:40] <bot-t> meancandy, -5 geek points for not noticing I am a bot.
[07:32:43] <NaBro> bLUEE: try using .each() and append $(this) to the element you want?
[07:32:50] <meancandy> lol
[07:33:00] <kborchers> meancandy: no, that intIndex would be the event object anyway, not an index
[07:33:02] <meancandy> been a while for me in irc
[07:33:38] <skua> <skua> after i deleted gallery.js $.load started working
[07:33:38] <skua> <skua> how can .js files conflict with each other?

[07:34:51] <javaNovice> i have changed,
[07:35:10] <meancandy> parseJSON -> var IDs = jQuery.parseJSON(data); ?
[07:36:08] <kborchers> meancandy: right
[07:36:28] <meancandy> cheers man i'll try that out than =)
[07:39:51] <meancandy> hm its still not returning the response. when i go through the skript line by line i get the echo only after i'm already past the success: line :-/
[07:44:50] <spersaud> {-_-\\\: so div.sub toggle would that be another listing under the main ul ?
[07:45:08] <{-_-\\\> yep
[07:45:34] <spersaud> sub being the id ?
[07:45:45] <{-_-\\\> class
[07:45:56] <{-_-\\\> there can be multiple subs
[07:45:59] <{-_-\\\> no difference really
[07:46:49] <spersaud> {-_-\\\: yeah, I am creating a separate one for each section, less confusing,
[07:48:34] <spersaud> so "div.sub" will be for example, "home-submenu" with <ul id="home"><li>Home</li><ul id="home-submenue"></ul></ul> ??
[07:49:59] <spersaud> {-_-\\\:  ??
[07:50:04] <spersaud> {-_-\\\:  ^^^
[07:50:44] <{-_-\\\> spersaud: yep
[07:52:16] <Topcat_> (function($) { //... yatayatayata }) (jQuery); what does the (jQuery); do outside of the function like that?
[07:52:30] <bLUEE> when I do something like this: $('.blogPost').last().append($(".blogPost", response).html()); I am expecting to add all of the divs from the response, but it only adds the first one?!
[07:53:56] <Topcat_> bLUEE: if response is an array don't you have to loop over it for each index?
[07:54:37] <bLUEE> Topcat_, the response is just a bunch of html i receieved from $.get
[07:55:24] <impi> hey guys, if i have this path in firebug, how will i get the value assigned to this? jQuery150534633972318333.events.handle.elem.jQuery.mobile.activePage
[07:55:50] <impi> i get the above by doing this: $(this).data()
[07:56:23] <NaBro> bLUEE: is this something like you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/6LKG9/
[07:56:45] <NaBro> wow, i need more coffee, sorry for the butchered english :)
[07:56:54] <bLUEE> NaBro let me try it
[07:57:14] <bLUEE> or let me try and show you my code
[07:59:48] <xckpd7> question: I have a very simple style question: is there a better way to write this? http://pastie.org/2788365
[07:59:56] <xckpd7> just 2 simple, very similar lines of code
[08:00:10] <xckpd7> there HAS to be a more simple way of writing that
[08:02:43] <aksnowman> xckpd7: I can't think of any way to make it more efficient
[08:03:23] <xckpd7> aksnowman: I just feel like it's inefficient... and I'm going to be adding extra cases to it right now
[08:04:13] <xckpd7> aksnowman: I was thinking of renaming the classes to "something-6" and then just stripping the something part to just leave the number
[08:04:22] <aksnowman> without having more context/code...
[08:04:33] <xec> both those if's would match if $parents has both classes too
[08:04:47] <aksnowman> xec: yeah, I was thinking that, too
[08:05:02] <aksnowman> xckpd7: you after the highest number w/i a range that exists in the set?
[08:05:11] <aksnowman> is there gonna be a definite upper bounds?
[08:05:12] <meancandy> kborchers: i found my mistake! the callback function had a syntax error and thus jquery skipped executing it - damn....
[08:05:30] <meancandy> kborchers: cheers for your help thou. much appreciated
[08:05:53] <aksnowman> xckpd7: 'cause if so, you could probably do like you said "something-X" and do a for loop to itterate through and find the highest one that exists
[08:06:07] <xckpd7> context: this is for a slideshow... the slideshow jquery plugin supports a displayqty variable, and I have different slideshows on the page which have different default slides set... the classes are to pass to the plugin letting it know how many to display by default... simple
[08:06:51] <xckpd7> I can change the classes or how this is done in whatever way I want probably
[08:07:48] <xckpd7> so they'll never have both classes... that should really be an else statement I guess
[08:07:55] <Aamir> xckpd7:  put the number of slides in a className like  someClass_6_sliders and than use split?
[08:08:22] <xckpd7> Aamir: yeah that would work
[08:09:59] <stimpie> does someone know a method to switch between 'pages' or 'screens'?
[08:11:05] <stimpie> I have my own implementation for pages but it seems so general there should be something like that already?
[08:14:00] <rgr> whats the selector for all img element that are not animating= Cant seem to get my head around not with :animated
[08:14:35] <devc> Happy Hallowe'en! Good morning and welcome back to the Monday hustle ;)
[08:14:38] <timing> $('img').not(':animated'); ?
[08:14:45] <timing> rgr: ^
[08:14:51] <aksnowman> darn, 2 seconds too late, haha
[08:14:57] <rgr> thanks
[08:15:50] <bLUEE> how can you find/filter a div but include the DIV in output i.e. .html() ?
[08:15:57] <aksnowman> stimpie: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/pagination ?
[08:16:07] <impi> hey guys if i have a big jquery object that i get like this: $j(this).data() how can i get specific data from it? like my datebox date?
[08:16:39] <impi> basically how do i pluck values by key from an object?
[08:17:24] <erichynds> $(this).data().keyName
[08:17:40] <aksnowman> impi: as in myObject.someVar or myObject.someKey.someSubVariable etc?
[08:19:27] <xckpd7> question: how expensive is regex in jQuery? I'm thinking of reformatting my class to be a little more thoughtout
[08:21:20] <Eviltwin> xckpd7: Can you give an example of where you intend to use the regex?
[08:21:34] <Eviltwin> Are you talking about a regex in a selector instead of looking up by class?
[08:21:43] <impi> aksnowman, as in : i just selected a date by using jquery mobile datebox. i can see the date as the value of my input. but i dont want to do: $('element').val() i want to do: $j(this).data().getKey().getDate()
[08:21:58] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: e.g. div class="something-4" to var = 4
[08:22:00] <mattmitchell> Could anyone recommend an approach to running JS tests on the server? I'm attempting to get Selenium + HtmlUnit to work (Java) and not having a ton of luck. I'd love to hear about what others are doing.
[08:22:10] <stimpie> aksnowman, thats pagination for a list I mean an application with a set of pages/screens which can be navigated.
[08:22:31] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: I want to take a class name and turn it into a number (since classes can't technically just be numbers in CSS2 I believe)
[08:22:58] <Eviltwin> That's actually JavaScript and it's not terribly slow
[08:24:31] <xckpd7> Eviltwin: thanks
[08:24:54] <oojacoboo> xckpd7: why would you want to change the class to a number?!
[08:25:01] <oojacoboo> that sounds like a terrible idea
[08:25:20] <aksnowman> oojacoboo: he's trying to store numbers with elements
[08:25:39] <oojacoboo> aksnowman: why not use another property then?
[08:25:41] <aksnowman> so he can manually set the number of visible slides in each slideshow
[08:25:44] <oojacoboo> why does it need to be a class??
[08:25:48] <aksnowman> no idea
[08:25:52] <oojacoboo> exactly
[08:25:56] <Eviltwin> What do you suggest instead?
[08:26:06] <xckpd7> oojacoboo: doesn't need to be, that's just how it's done now
[08:26:07] * aksnowman doesn't know off-hand what else to use, but then again doesn't have a ton of exp w/ this stuff, haha
[08:26:08] <oojacoboo> my-number-thingy="1"
[08:26:13] <oojacoboo> or whatever floats your boat
[08:26:20] <oojacoboo> but not the class
[08:26:52] <xckpd7> can an attribute be just a number like that?
[08:27:00] <oojacoboo> uh… yes
[08:27:02] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[08:27:15] <xckpd7> um.. dunno :D
[08:27:27] <xckpd7> figured it was invalid to start off an attribute with a number
[08:27:29] <aksnowman> numSlides=4 $(this).attr('numSlides')
[08:27:48] <aksnowman> xckpd7: to start the name, maybe, but not the value
[08:27:51] <oojacoboo> xckpd7: only classes and maybe id
[08:27:55] <bLUEE> thanks !
[08:28:07] <xckpd7> well that's extremely helpful
[08:28:14] <xckpd7> I knew I asked here for a reason... thanks
[08:32:30] <Nicklas`> Hi everybody
[08:32:49] <Nicklas`> I come here, because I think there is an issue in datepicker plugin
[08:33:32] <Nicklas`> some developpers find bugs "inst is undefined" ; but this bug is always classified in invalid.
[08:33:40] <Nicklas`> But I think there is really a bug
[08:34:00] <timing> Nicklas`: I've been looking at this screen for 2 minutes now, and I still see no bug
[08:34:06] <amh345> what is the term for when you have an animation/text displaying while you wait for something to load in jquery?  and how would it be applied to a replaceWith ?
[08:34:13] <Nicklas`> In my use cas, I create a template div that contains <input type="text" id="datepicker">
[08:34:36] <oojacoboo> amh345: loading.gif is a common name
[08:34:43] <oojacoboo> ajax loader maybe
[08:34:47] <Nicklas`> After an event, I clone my div to create a tab (with jqueryui-tab)
[08:35:02] <Nicklas`> so I have two objects "datepicker"
[08:35:25] <Nicklas`> In javascript, I do : $('#mynewdiv #datepicker').datepicker();
[08:36:08] <Nicklas`> and it's rather ok... my new field "datepicker" is well a datepicker (whereas in my template, it's only a classic input field)
[08:36:29] <Nicklas`> Now, if I click in my datepicker field. The calendar is shown.
[08:36:33] <Nicklas`> All is OK
[08:36:37] <Nicklas`> But...
[08:36:40] <Nicklas`> :(
[08:36:54] <kettle> If I have three th's and I click one, is there anyway to tell if I clicked the first, second or third?
[08:37:06] <Nicklas`> the HTML links in the calendar point on my first datepicker (in my template)
[08:37:33] <Nicklas`> and so no on the datepicker field has the the datepicker feature.
[08:38:05] <ajpiano> Nicklas`: so you have multiple elements with the id="datepicker"
[08:38:08] <ajpiano> in the DOM at the same time?
[08:38:12] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: yes
[08:38:17] <ajpiano> ok so that's what we call invalid
[08:38:22] <ajpiano> and you can't have that
[08:38:35] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: ok
[08:38:37] <ajpiano> so fix that and see if your bug goes away
[08:38:46] <ngharo_> ?index @ kettle
[08:38:46] <bot-t> kettle, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[08:38:53] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: but I use a class to identify the field, it's the same think
[08:38:56] <Nicklas`> thing
[08:39:06] <ajpiano> Nicklas`: it's still really bad to have multiple elements with the sam ID
[08:39:10] <ajpiano> so just don't do it
[08:39:20] <_dave_h_d> hi all,does anyone know of a good example of js implementation of command pattern in relation to "undo" command
[08:39:38] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: for ID, I agree... but if I use the same class, I have the same issue (class="datepicker")
[08:39:54] <ajpiano> yeah but they all ALSO still have the same ID which is problematic
[08:40:11] <amh345> oojacoboo: i see that the loading.gif image is a call just before a load.  it looks very simple.   does it work the same way with replaceWith instead of load?
[08:40:24] <oojacoboo> amh345: what?!
[08:40:40] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: and if I don't set the id value
[08:40:43] <oojacoboo> just put it as an image within a container and replace all the html within that container on success and load
[08:40:48] <ajpiano> it still breaks?
[08:40:53] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: <input type="text" class="datepicker">
[08:41:11] <oojacoboo> <input /> PLEASE
[08:41:12] <amh345> oojacoboo: all the info im finding on it looks like this http://www.electrictoolbox.com/load-content-jquery-ajax-loading-image/
[08:41:24] <impi> ajpiano, i think i have the same problem, but if i may ask. if i have a input that calls a jquery mobile calendar and i choose a date, how do i get that date? doing something like $('element').val() will always return the first date?
[08:41:32] <amh345>   $('#example-placeholder').html('<p><img src="/images/ajax-loader.gif" width="220" height="19" /></p>');  //  $('#example-placeholder').load("/examples/ajax-loaded.html");
[08:41:43] <oojacoboo> amh345: it's just an image, this is custom, you don't need some TOOL
[08:41:47] <amh345> i dont see anything regarding success
[08:41:47] <ajpiano> impi: select *only* the element whose value you want
[08:41:54] <ajpiano> .val() returns the value of the first element in the collection
[08:41:58] <ajpiano> so... don't select multiple elements
[08:42:03] <oojacoboo> amh345: you're loading in ajax content, no?
[08:42:16] <impi> ajpiano, how will i select only the elemnt i want :( i think this is waht i dont know
[08:42:22] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: you're right
[08:42:25] <ajpiano> using selectors and traversing
[08:42:34] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: if I don't use id attribut it's ok
[08:42:39] <amh345> oojacoboo: yes. im loading an include of sorts with replaceWith.   the include is heavy on the db.
[08:42:39] <ajpiano> Nicklas`: high-five
[08:42:50] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: or, I have to change my code to have an unique id
[08:43:02] <oojacoboo> amh345: yea, so, when it loads, it will replace the image
[08:43:03] <Nicklas`> ajpiano: sorry
[08:43:22] <oojacoboo> just put the image into your HTML DOM then load over it with your ajax
[08:43:25] <Patabugen> Hey All. I'm using jQuery UI Tabs with content via Ajax. Is there some way I can make it remove the contents when another tab is selected?
[08:43:36] <amh345> oojacoboo: that simple?    is there a way to simulate load times?
[08:43:46] <oojacoboo> huh
[08:43:47] <oojacoboo> ?
[08:44:04] <oojacoboo> you mean with a progress indicator?
[08:44:10] <amh345> well, it's pretty fast on my local machine so i dont get a good idea of how it looks.  i'd like to load it after 10 seconds or something
[08:44:28] <oojacoboo> load what?
[08:44:58] <Patabugen> amh345 You'd do that in your back end code, i.e in PHP you could use sleep()
[08:44:58] <amh345> i'd like to fake the amount of time it takes to load the include. so i can get an idea on it flows.
[08:45:03] <amh345> oh ok
[08:45:09] <Patabugen> That's how I do it, at least
[08:45:15] <Patabugen> I've not seen any of the rest of your problem :)
[08:46:11] <etcha^> does anyone use jquery lightbox plugin? i need to know if i can use it to break out of an iframe?
[08:46:47] <jedimind> etcha^, you mean intiialize it from inside an iframe and then have it go into the parent document and overlay there?
[08:46:53] <etcha^> yeah
[08:46:59] <Cade> I have this simply popout menu method http://pastebin.com/V6AjFWaX The problem is that if the cursor is moved to the popout menu before it is fully extended, the show() method keeps repeating until the cursor is moved off of the active area.
[08:47:04] <amh345> Patabugen: im just trying to figure out how a 'loading' image works in respect to waiting on a replaceWith to populate
[08:47:08] <Cade> simply=simple
[08:47:25] <jedimind> etcha^, the only way you can od it, is to initialize it on the parent document, then when you trigger it in the child document, you have to call back to the parent with a custom function
[08:47:47] <jedimind> but if you have no control over the parent, then there's nothing you can do, and if your iframe and parent are on different domains, you will have even more issues
[08:48:01] <etcha^> ok, i have no idea how to do that, but ill sort it out, thanks jedimind :)
[08:48:26] <jedimind> be prepared to pull some hair out if you dont know what you're doing :)
[08:48:48] <etcha^> heh, ok

[08:59:00] <albertosh> anyone knows how to make .fadeIn Out effects that work on iOS???
[08:59:12] <kettle> Thanks ryanneufeld
[08:59:31] <Oldskool> albertosh: it should work in any browser that support js?

[09:00:07] <bot-t> Cade, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:01:33] <albertosh> no it doesn work Oldskool, i mean, the animation is not visible on ios
[09:01:55] <albertosh> just the beginning and end points
[09:02:42] <Oldskool> albertosh: that's weird .. all .fade does is deplete the opacity from 1.00 to 0.00 in the specified amount of time .. should be totally OS unrelated
[09:02:49] <aksnowman> albertosh: got a link I could view it on?
[09:03:19] <Oldskool> sounds to me like it's more of a safari problem or something ... different browser maybe?

[09:09:05] <Joe`Black> Hi Everybody
[09:09:06] <cafaro> Is there a difference between using [value=''] in the selectors itself vs .filter("[value='']")..? Because only the latter seems to work for me

[09:11:32] <Joe`Black> Thanks I'll check out your link... Forgot to say, I'm a complete newbie
[09:11:38] <Patabugen> Just a generic one, so I can store a function somewhere

[09:12:18] <Patabugen> Nah, nothing specific to jQuery

[09:23:26] <Cade> Hello?
[09:24:15] <saba> Does anyone know of a (preferable good) plugin that does datepicking and timepicking, with multidates?
[09:24:16] <sean`> Cade, Is it me you're looking for?
[09:24:30] <PrgmrBill> haha
[09:24:34] <snover> sean`: Are you the one I’ve been waiting for?
[09:24:37] <Cade> Anyone who can help with this thing
[09:24:39] <saba> There are many datepicker plugins and many timepicking plugins and some datetimepicking plugins. However not with multidate.
[09:25:07] <saba> and the datepicker jquery UI plugin is seriously horribly written. Try to interact with that plugin, it's not recommended.
[09:25:11] <devc> Cade: I think you should justn eed to add .stop(). before your .hide() and .show() methods.
[09:25:12] <saba> :-)
[09:25:29] <sean`> :-P
[09:26:11] <saba> also I need 24h support ;-P
[09:26:26] <ignaciogiri> Hello guys, I need some ideas about how doing a fixed footer resizable: http://www.ignaciogiri.com/clients/roombounce/bouncecast.html
[09:26:43] <saba> it's interesting that there's a lot of plugins for this, but none that does everything.
[09:26:48] <Aamir> saba:  http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[09:27:22] <Cade> devc, doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/39fdA/3/
[09:27:47] <saba> Aamir: that's without multidates, and for timepicking I like this one better http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/
[09:28:02] <devc> Cade: works for me. Explain.
[09:28:17] <devc> I would recommend chaining them, but aside from that, it works.
[09:28:27] <Aamir> saba:  i used http://manfersite.co.cc/dateplustimepicker/demo/demo.html# but its down atm
[09:28:41] <Cade> What browser are you using? I'm using firefox.
[09:28:46] <devc> Chrome.
[09:29:07] <saba> Aamir: interesting, I don't believe I've seen that one. Does it support multidate along with a timepicker?
[09:29:11] <Aamir> saba:  something like http://gyazo.com/9eaf7a7c5b63d959393036f1ab9c5955
[09:29:17] <Aamir> ?
[09:29:21] <Cade> Ok, it doesn't do it in chrome. It does in firefox, though.
[09:30:00] <saba> Aamir: is it time range only or can you pick like 14th november, 16th november and the 3rd of december? (and a time for each)
[09:30:03] <Cade> And, disgustingly enough, it also works fine in IE
[09:30:20] <Aamir> saba:  one date only and time
[09:30:44] <saba> Aamir: then it's unfortunately not enough, but thanks for trying
[09:31:13] <saba> I'm really starting to believe that there isn't a jquery plugin for this, although there are 50+ timepicker and datepickers out there.
[09:31:31] <Aamir> saba:  humm you want to select many dates and one time ?
[09:31:47] <saba> Aamir: no, many separately dates and one time for each date
[09:31:57] <saba> and support for 24h clock :-)
[09:32:06] <Aamir> saba:  not sure you will find anything like this :P
[09:32:15] <Cade> devc, can you look at it in FF?
[09:32:33] <saba> Aamir: I'm about writing my own, maybe that could be an contribution in the future.
[09:32:47] <spersaud> can someone give me a short example of how to make a toggle style navigation menu ?
[09:32:51] <biodegabriel> Hi everybody, I'm not sure to pass two values to my .animate call (one of them is calculated). Can someone help me with the syntax? I've tried 4 or 5 different ways of writing this, but nothing works. I just need "{calculated-value}px 50px" as the parameters... http://pastie.org/2788823
[09:33:16] <spersaud> {-_-\\\:  suggested this
[09:33:18] <spersaud> $("#navigation").click(function(){$'search', this).toggle();});
[09:33:28] <spersaud> but its not working for me, can someone show the html ?
[09:33:36] <spersaud> paste would be nice
[09:33:39] <Aamir> saba:  you can use any date time ui plugin and hack the onSelect method and keep adding selected dates to a hidden input or div and at the end get all date and times separated by comma or something ?
[09:33:43] <biodegabriel> *how to pass....
[09:34:51] <saba> Aamir: no, unfortunately, the onSelect method is an absolutely insane and extensive example of how to *not* write a plugin.
[09:35:31] <Aamir> saba:  :| its based on jQuery UI widget factory
[09:36:14] <saba> Aamir: yes, but it's impossible to interact with. you can save them to a hidden div, but you can't keep them selected + being able to unselect them.
[09:36:49] <saba> it's been two weeks since I tried it so I can't remember all the details but it was one of my worst experiences with jquery UI. some of their works are really good, some are really not.
[09:36:50] <Aamir> saba:  humm so you need each date as toggle button
[09:37:41] <saba> Aamir: yes, because the user must start from the beginning. In my case they will select around 30 dates over a 2 month period, thus you need the flexibility to select / unselect freely.
[09:38:50] <Aamir> saba: i will try to sort something if I get time :) in the mean while  you can file a feature request to the ui time
[09:38:55] <Aamir> team*
[09:39:06] <biodegabriel> i found a solution :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5171080/jquery-animate-background-position
[09:40:20] <saba> Aamir: that's nice of you. I believe the multidate feature is already in the discussions. There are many hacks to "fix" it but I think a partly rewrite is required in order to support it with current datepicker.
[09:41:11] <Aamir> saba:  true.  http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-datepicker-pick-multiple-dates
[09:43:19] <trose> is there a jquery plugin that will allow me to display and manage files similar to an email manager? instead of emails I want users to be able to manipulate files they have uploaded to the server.
[09:43:54] <Aamir> saba:  what about this: http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/ ? :)
[09:45:24] <saba> Aamir: wow! that looks solid. I will look into it, many thanks! :-)
[09:45:50] <Cade> devc, putting .stop() before the show and hide functions just screwed up the positioning of the popout menus
[09:45:55] <Aamir> saba:  now with this you can add time picker and save it for each onSelect
[09:46:09] <saba> yepp, that will be integrated
[09:48:47] <devc> Cade: Sorry man, I have my own issues I'm hustling on right now. If I catch myself up I'll see if I can help.
[09:48:53] <Cade> ok
[09:49:12] <devc> if you don't stop animations, you will not fix your problem because you have a delayed action on an instant event.
[09:49:53] <devc> so I'd start looking at other parts before I take those stop()'s out. They're a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. But it's your script, do what you like, I'm just telling you what I know from experience.
[09:51:13] <biodegabriel> Hi all, I need to assign the background position values to 'backgroundPosition' instead of 'background-position-x' and 'background-position-y'. I've tried several times and failed. How do I re-write this for 'backgroundPosition'? http://pastie.org/2788928
[09:52:57] <biodegabriel> It's a real head scratcher!
[09:53:32] <evil-twin> backgroundPosition: "x y"
[09:53:47] <evil-twin> = i mean
[09:53:49] <evil-twin> :P
[09:54:17] <biodegabriel> evil-twin: one of the values is calculated and the other is hard coded. i've tried your approach and it doesn't work. i'll try it again though, one last time. :)
[09:55:19] <devc> biodegabriel: You need to remove the apostrophe's when you change the value's to a javascript style camelCase.
[09:55:36] <devc> so instead of 'background-position-x' you just want backgroundPosition
[09:55:44] <biodegabriel> devc: gotcha. thx
[09:55:51] <biodegabriel> (still doesn't work though)
[09:56:06] <devc> biodegabriel: also, you need to add +'px' to your values, regular CSS rules apply.
[09:56:36] <biodegabriel> devc:  you can see what i'm trying at the bottom of this pastie. http://pastie.org/2788928
[09:56:39] <devc> and that won't work in IE<8, you need to use backgorundposition.
[09:57:37] <devc> biodegabriel:  oops, the above meant that in <IE8 you need ot use background-position-x and background-position-y
[09:57:39] <biodegabriel> devc:  i'm using backgroundPosition, but I can't seem to pass two values to it. I can either just pass it an integer, or a string, but I can't mix an integer and a string
[09:58:05] <devc> biodegabriel: put together a jsfiddle isolated code bit and we'll be able to fix it, me thinks.
[09:58:06] <biodegabriel> devc: background-position-x and background-position-y dont' work in opera or firefox. http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/background-position-x-y
[09:58:21] <devc> biodegabriel:  I didn't say they do.
[09:58:41] <devc> I said that in less than <IE8 you cannot animate backgroundPosition. You must use background-position-x
[09:58:49] <Cade> Will events trigger on an element while it's in the middle of an animation?
[09:58:57] <devc> Cade:  Yes.
[09:59:06] <devc> That's what .stop() is for.
[09:59:07] <biodegabriel> devc:  ah ok. so i guess i won't have any animation for <IE8. it's not essential
[10:00:26] <Cade> When I put stop() in front of show/hide it just screws up the positioning.
[10:02:14] <devc> Cade: You need to rethink how you're thinking about it. It doesn't 'just' screw up positioning.
[10:02:25] <devc> It fixes your issue, and your CSS is broken.
[10:02:53] <devc> So either look for another way to fix your hover issue (in my opinion not possible) or fix your CSS.
[10:03:17] <Cade> It confuses the starting slide position for the ending slide position and moves it back even further to slide the menu out
[10:03:58] <Cade> It DOESN'T fix my issue. I still get the repeating slideout even when I have .stop() in the code.
[10:04:18] <devc> You're not even listening now. This convo is over. Good luck.
[10:05:42] <Cade> What you told me to do did not fix my problem, and added another problem on top of it.
[10:06:16] <devc> biodegabriel: If you throw together a jsfiddle we'll be able to see where the issue is, without it I can't check to see what objects and values you're working with.
[10:06:18] <NaBro> Cade: devc is saying that you have an underlying issue with your CSS and if you get that working, with .stop(), you'll solve your problem
[10:06:36] <biodegabriel> devc: almost done the jsfiddle setup. :) thx
[10:06:50] <fatguylaughing> How do I affect all divs with the blah class?
[10:06:59] <fatguylaughing> So far it's just hitting the first one and that's it.
[10:07:03] <devc> fatguylaughing: $('.class').
[10:07:27] <NaBro> fatguylaughing: try using .each() to loop through each element
[10:07:32] * NaBro hides
[10:07:42] <devc> biodegabriel:  Cool sorry, I wasn't sure if you'd seen the request so I was coming back to make sure I was being thorough ;)
[10:08:05] <devc> NaBro: Thanks for clarifying. I'd given up. haha
[10:08:23] <biodegabriel> devc: Here it is. (make your browser window wide, if the html output is being crushed. :) http://jsfiddle.net/CCVzG/2/
[10:08:33] <Cade> I'm setting the menu to position:absolute and giving it a specific left value, which the menu is not being set to.

[10:09:39] <biodegabriel> devc: the background is supposed to move slightly, creating a parallax effect. right now, it just rolls with the div. i can get it to work with background-position-x and background-position-y but not to backgroundPosition
[10:10:32] <joe`black> Hi Again ! Tried without luck resolving what i believe is a jquery conflict, can someone please take a look at the source of my site please and tell me what's wrong ?
[10:10:40] <fatguylaughing> devc: Thanks ;)
[10:12:51] <fatguylaughing> devc: So I feel dumb because I told you the wrong thing. I have a .click event on a tag. Looks like this $("a#electric-click").click(function(){}); However it only takes affect on this one and there is another a tag that has the same id.
[10:13:08] <Brodingo> ELECTRIC CLICKKKKKKKKKK
[10:13:14] <fatguylaughing> lmao
[10:13:21] <Brodingo> ZAP
[10:13:25] <devc> fatguylaughing: There's your problem. HTML pages can only have one id of each name
[10:13:28] <fatguylaughing> I know it's dumb but for now it's just proof of concept :D
[10:13:35] <Brodingo> its not dumb
[10:13:36] <Brodingo> its
[10:13:38] <devc> fatguylaughing: And what I mean is, id's must be unique on the page
[10:13:40] <fatguylaughing> facepalm
[10:13:42] <Brodingo> AWESOME
[10:13:43] <evil-twin> it's a trick.. don't click it or you'll get pranked!
[10:13:48] <sk8ball> can anyone take a look and tell/show me what i'm doing wrong please? (its a simple function for returning the value of a querystring parameter from the url...) i'm structuring it wrong thugh so that i can call it like:   var foo = $.urlParam("param1")
[10:13:52] <Brodingo> BZZZT
[10:14:06] <fatguylaughing> devc: Ugh, thanks I should of known better. I was so focused on the JS I forgot basic rules with html/css
[10:14:07] <devc> fatguylaughing: Instead, you want to have multiple classes named 'electric-click'
[10:14:12] <fatguylaughing> <-- jackass
[10:14:19] <devc> fatguylaughing: No worries dude, that's what we're here for

[10:15:12] <fatguylaughing> devc: Ugh, cross brewer/ cross platform = Insanity.
[10:15:17] <fatguylaughing> Pretty sure it's the definition.

[10:25:22] <Phrogz> sk8ball: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=jquery%20plugins&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CEgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.jquery.com%2FPlugins%2FAuthoring&ei=5NmuTuTkDKSNigKB7bHuCg&usg=AFQjCNGxuzcea3HmV0Glq39_3AaUFpJDUA
[10:25:26] <Phrogz> Phah.
[10:25:32] <Phrogz> sk8ball: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[10:25:52] <Phrogz> !attr() @ daslicht
[10:25:58] <Phrogz> ?attr() @ daslicht
[10:25:58] <bot-t> daslicht, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[10:26:05] <Phrogz> Damnit, what's the bot trigger?
[10:26:17] <devc> `attr @ daslicht
[10:26:17] <NaBro> common sense?
[10:26:31] <daslicht> i trued it with attr( attributeName , value  )  but that wont work ?!
[10:26:35] <pmcgovern> daslicht: http://neutroncreations.com/blog/building-a-custom-html5-audio-player-with-jquery/
[10:26:48] <daslicht> maybe since it need another nested  <source >  element ?
[10:26:58] <daslicht> ahh that looks promising
[10:26:59] <daslicht> thanks
[10:27:00] <Phrogz> daslicht: Make a test case and show it to us. Saying "It doesn't work?!" doesn't help.
[10:27:15] <daslicht> $("myplayer").attr('src','audio/thePadSong.mp3');
[10:27:33] <NaBro> what element is myplayer?
[10:27:48] <daslicht> ist an <audio>
[10:27:53] <devc> is it an id?
[10:28:00] <daslicht> <audio id='myplayer' controls></audio>
[10:28:04] <devc> should it be $('#myplayer')
[10:28:08] <NaBro> ^
[10:28:18] <daslicht> arg
[10:28:22] <daslicht> i try
[10:28:49] <frewsxcv> is there a way to emulate $(document).ready without jQuery?
[10:29:00] <Phrogz> daslicht: In the future, you might want to learn how to debug. Try      console.log( $('myplayer') )  or  console.log( $('myplayer').length ) to validate that you're actually finding your element.
[10:29:02] <Cade> Is there any known problem with the Jquery UI slide effect when one element is sliding in and another element is sliding out at the same time, when the event handler is assigned to a group of elements at once?
[10:29:03] <pmcgovern> frewsxcv: onLoad
[10:29:09] <sk8ball> puppenn, take a look at this... http://www.pastie.org/2789128  .. that should work right? for me to be able to call it like so, $.urlParam('param') yes?
[10:29:20] <frewsxcv> pmcgovern: that's different, that loads after/during images are loaded
[10:29:35] <sk8ball> phrogz, im definitely bookmarking the docs and reading them
[10:29:44] <sk8ball> by i just need to bang this out real quick
[10:29:47] <daslicht> yeh, that sounds great , as i stated i just strated learning javascript stuff
[10:29:51] <trewd> hi everyone, is there a way to sort the oCatSet list based on a td cell value? oCatSet = $("#msgproducts TR");
[10:29:52] <NaBro> frewsxcv: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/799981/document-ready-equivalent-without-jquery
[10:30:05] <devc> frewsxcv: There are definitely ways but because IE hates the World there are differences between browsers. jQuery encapsulates that.
[10:31:59] <daslicht> looks like i have to read something on how to debug , i dont even find the console
[10:32:19] <NaBro> daslicht: right click and inspect element (chrome/safari)
[10:32:41] <NaBro> same in firefox if you've installed firebug
[10:33:07] <Cade> I have a set of popout menus where, if you mouse over the popout before it finishes extending, the popout effect keeps repeating (this only happens in FF). I was told to put a .stop() function in front of the show/hide functions. This did not stop the repeating effect and caused the script to confuse the starting and ending slide positions of the menu when more than one of them are open at...
[10:33:08] <Cade> ...the same time.
[10:33:10] <devc> daslicht: NaBro's offering great advice. Read up on how to use Break points and console.log and you'll love JavaScript 400x more. HAHA
[10:33:16] <daslicht> ahh i see , now i can see if the source was set correct , but what does  console.log( $('myplayer') )  do ?
[10:33:36] <NaBro> daslicht: that specific statement would fail
[10:33:44] <NaBro> which would show you your selector isn't correct
[10:33:56] <devc> daslicht: In this case, nothing because it doesn't exist. but with console.log($('#myplayer')); it would ;)
[10:35:07] <daslicht> when i do console.log( $('#myplayer') ); nothing is shown at that rightclick inspect view console view :)
[10:35:22] <daslicht> ok i see I google for how to debug javascript
[10:35:22] <tommyent> Can anyone point me in the right direction. I am using slidedown but it pushed the page down my client would like to keep the slide down at eye level and push the rest of the page up. I have failed in every attempt to tdo this any help would be greatly appreciated
[10:35:38] <daslicht> any specific reading suggestions ?

[10:36:36] <daslicht> thanks!
[10:36:59] <pmcgovern> I'm using a query plugin that is supposed to load a star rating system. There are no console errors and the code is generated in the HTML, but nothing shows. Is there something blazingly wrong here? http://pastie.org/2789172
[10:37:09] <daslicht> ok bbl :) 8`) ner mode activated
[10:37:15] <daslicht> nerd
[10:39:36] <Cade> In this script http://jsfiddle.net/39fdA/4/ if you mouse over two of the boxes quickly, so that one submenu opens before the other closes fully, then scroll over the first one again, the submenu is pushed far to the left.
[10:40:26] <daslicht> nice page :)
[10:40:27] <Cade> In firefox
[10:42:45] <pmcgovern> jslint says all my code is valid
[10:44:03] <ravenzz> Cade did you read the stop() documentation?
[10:46:49] <Cade> I'm looking at it.
[10:46:57] <ravenzz> Cade http://jsfiddle.net/dJ4MZ/
[10:48:31] <NaBro> pmcgovern: your example is using jQ 1.3.2, the plugin page uses 1.6.4 in it's example. i'd start by updating your version of jQ
[10:48:52] <NaBro> pmcgovern: i'd then take their working example page from gitHub and modify it as needed for testing purposes
[10:49:23] <Cade> ravenzz, thank you. I originally put the .stop() in to solve another problem that still isn't fixed.
[10:50:17] <Cade> In Firefox, if you hover over the popout before it finishes extending, the popout effect keeps repeating.
[10:51:20] <pmcgovern> NaBro: no change with js 1.6.4
[10:52:16] <pmcgovern> but thank you for pointing that out
[10:52:16] <jschoolcraft> I'm trying to add a fairly complex bit of form to a page.  Trying to clone a hidden div, then replace a bunch of data based on a drop down list selection.  Is there a better way?
[10:52:31] <NaBro> pmcgovern: start with their index.html page from github, take the plugin specific code and work from there
[10:52:35] <oodavid> Is it possible to pass complex (deep) data objects to {{tmpl}}? My tests keep failing me without an error... http://jsfiddle.net/pK8ye/175/
[10:54:27] <avent> I do not understand why this is not working: http://jsfiddle.net/j9E2M/             It's basically an initial setup for form validation
[10:54:39] <avent> Any pointers as to where the error might be?
[10:57:48] <oodavid> avent: you're mixing up name and email
[10:58:11] <oodavid> email.removeClass() etc
[10:58:54] <avent> Oh God... So bloody obvious. Thanks so much :)
[10:59:03] <oodavid> avent: no probs ;-)
[10:59:24] <oodavid> avent: also, you can chain your method calls if you want, like so: email.removeClass('input').addClass('error');
[11:00:13] <avent> Will do and it works! :D
[11:00:51] <frewsxcv> does javascript load images or window.onload first?
[11:07:19] <smplstk> frewsxcv: images are last.
[11:07:56] <smplstk> domready and load will fire before all the images on the page have loaded.
[11:12:33] <avent> Could someone also point me to some information on how to decode things like the following when validating emails: var valid = /^([\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/;    Or maybe explain this to me: '/^([\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/'?
[11:12:37] <Cade> Wonderful. Now the popout effect doesn't repeat, it just closes again and stays closed.
[11:13:50] <daslicht> how to set multiple sources for a <audio> element ? with jquery ?
[11:13:51] <frewsxcv> smplstk: so is there any difference between window.onload and $(document).read() ?
[11:13:52] <frewsxcv> *ready
[11:14:06] <luite> avent: that one doesn't properly validate email addresses, use this instead: http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html
[11:14:18] <daslicht> this wount work : $("#myplayer").attr('src','audio/thePadSong.mp3');
[11:14:18] <daslicht> 	$("#myplayer").attr('src','audio/ansolas-nice_arps.ogg');
[11:14:29] <avent> luite: thanks! i'll look into it :)
[11:14:46] <datlap> I m using slider.js and when i step through the debugger this func animationStart: function(current){ never gets called .any idea?
[11:15:26] <avent> luite:could you explain in a few words what this does exactly?
[11:15:58] <frewsxcv> smplstk: so i guess onload loads after images have loaded
[11:16:02] <luite> avent: actually I meant that more as a demonstration for how impractical regular expressions are for validating email (see the note below, you still need to preprocess the string for that one to work!)
[11:16:47] <avent> luite: what would you recommend for validating email adresses then?
[11:16:50] <luite> avent: you should look up regular expressions tutorials
[11:17:13] <luite> avent: to learn the syntax of these things
[11:17:24] <yan_nick> hey guys, how can i fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/KG2qM/
[11:17:29] <avent> luite: will do. thanks
[11:18:27] <luite> avent: hmm, I don't know what exists in javascript that properly validates email according to the RFC, but if there is one, then it probably uses a hand-written (or generated) parser, not a regular expression
[11:18:31] <SkyFlyer> anyone know of anything where i can specify the timezone and it returns the offset?    say getOffset('America/Los Angeles');  returns -8:00   ??
[11:18:49] <Cade> firebug needs a fake mouse cursor that you can drag onto the browser that it will obey instead of the real mouse, so you can look at different values.
[11:18:52] <SkyFlyer> or an api I can send the call to ?
[11:20:20] <barraponto> i am looking for a plugin that turns <select> into <ul>, keeping the form functionality... is there any?
[11:23:03] <oodavid> Solved my problem with {{tmpl}} tags and complex data objects: http://jsfiddle.net/pK8ye/176/
[11:23:31] <NaBro> barraponto: does it need to be a ul element specifically?
[11:23:37] <devc> barraponto: Do you mean reads a <select> and outputs html of a <ul> or that see's a <select> and displays it like a <ul>?
[11:24:17] <daslicht> ok i solved it by appending source elements :)
[11:25:04] <Cade> I'm trying to keep the popout rollover from repeating when you mouse over the submenu before it's finished extending, but now it just closes again and stays closed. http://jsfiddle.net/39fdA/8/ this problem only happens in Firefox.
[11:26:12] <ScottO_> should i be using a filter to make it beep on alarm? or a perl script?
[11:31:04] <daslicht> I have the following: http://pastebin.com/NWfX2f5q
[11:31:24] <daslicht> this plays back in chrome, firefox and safari but not in IE9 ?!
[11:32:10] <daslicht> it also plays in opera
[11:32:16] <daslicht> why not in IE9?
[11:32:43] <daslicht> idea?
[11:32:44] <biodegabriel> devc: I found a solution here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5518834/jquery-animate-background-position-firefox
[11:33:01] <biodegabriel> Kinda ridiculous that this doesn't work by itself though.... :|
[11:33:15] <biodegabriel> I shouldn't complain though.
[11:34:32] <smplstk> frewsxcv: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/6SEwH/
[11:35:00] <smplstk> it would appear window.onload comes last.
[11:35:19] <z3yo> Is it possible two swap two sortable elements from a list to another ? I tried with connectWith option but that doesnt work
[11:35:22] <smplstk> (nobody uses window.onload)
[11:35:48] <daslicht> huh even this did not work in IE9 : <audio id='myplayer' controls>
[11:35:49] <daslicht> <source src='audio/thePadSong.mp3'></source>
[11:35:49] <daslicht> </audio>
[11:36:01] <daslicht> idea why ?
[11:36:09] <NaBro> the image would load before .onload because .onload is being called after .ready...
[11:36:19] <NaBro> and the img element is already parsed
[11:36:47] <smplstk> ya, I just realized
[11:39:02] <daslicht> i have inspected teh console :) in ie9 and it says : SCRIPT65535: Unexpected call to method or property access.
[11:39:02] <daslicht> jquery-1.6.4.min.js, line 3 character 29586
[11:39:14] <Cade> WHY THE FUCK WON'T THIS WORK!
[11:39:38] <Eviltwin> 'Cause
[11:39:40] <NaBro> easy Cade
[11:39:59] <Cade> The damn submenus won't close at all now
[11:40:12] <Cade> http://jsfiddle.net/39fdA/11/
[11:40:30] <ajpiano> Cade: it helps if you call .data on a jQuery object
[11:40:39] <ajpiano> it also helps if you don't vent your frustrations into an IRC channel
[11:40:45] <ajpiano> $(this).data("isHovering", 1);
[11:41:14] <ajpiano> anyhow, carry on
[11:41:16] <ravenzz> maybe you don't need that
[11:41:19] <ravenzz> at all
[11:41:33] <mythril> I'm using jqueryui and wondering if there is a straight forward way to create toggles dynamically
[11:41:42] <ravenzz> I can't remember the name of that hover plugin mmh help me ajpiano
[11:41:44] <daslicht> noone ?
[11:41:48] <ajpiano> ?g hoverIntent
[11:41:50] <NaBro> the ole this vs $(this) ...
[11:41:50] <bot-t> ajpiano, hoverIntent jQuery Plug-in - http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html
[11:42:01] <ravenzz> yep
[11:42:13] <bot-t> The hover events (mouseenter and mouseleave) are fired whenever the user hovers the element, however quickly. You probably need to make sure the user wants to hover. hoverIntent (http://bit.ly/QJz5) and $.event.special.hover (http://bit.ly/1VBJW) will automatically normalize the hover event, or you can debounce manually using throttle/debounce (http://bit.ly/e8d9TB). Animating? How .stop() works (http://bit.ly/5kq9xo)
[11:42:38] <z3yo> Is it possible to swap two sortable elements from a list to another ? I tried with connectWith option but that doesnt work
[11:43:09] <smplstk> I'm still mad confused by this: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/6SEwH/
[11:43:22] <smplstk> totally thought img load would come AFTER window.onload
[11:43:24] <Cade> ajpiano, I got more of a response by screaming than I did by asking politely over the past two hours.
[11:43:51] <ajpiano> Cade: let's just say that past performance will not be indicative of future results
[11:44:01] <ajpiano> with respect to using that strategy
[11:53:47] <NaBro> smplstk: in firefox (at least) domready fires before el.onload/window.onload
[11:54:06] <NaBro> didn't realize dom was ready before window was ...
[11:54:16] <daslicht> how to make the <audio> tag work under IE9 ?
[11:54:35] <NaBro> daslicht: did you test it in IE9 without using JavaScript/
[11:54:35] <NaBro> ?
[11:54:45] <NaBro> to ensure it's working in general?
[11:55:21] <daslicht> bah , the css compatible mode was the fault
[11:55:29] <daslicht> evil thing
[11:55:32] <daslicht> now its working
[11:56:20] <smplstk> NaBro: the dom is always first, that much I knew
[11:57:08] <NewtonianB> Why does my page scroll when I click on a radio button with jquery, its populating data on a page but the automtaic scroll is really annoying
[11:58:06] <smplstk> NewtonianB: do you have some code to share? Is it scrolling to the top?
[11:59:53] <NaBro> smplstk: guess i should have asked what your question was about what wasn't working...
[11:59:55] <NaBro> =D
[12:02:23] <NewtonianB> smplstk: http://pastebin.com/XMSCG6rD  this code the page scrolls when i click on the radip buttons
[12:02:47] <NewtonianB> smplstk: Since data is getting added to the html naturally the scroll bar changes size but it seems to be jumping now i just wan tto disable
[12:03:55] <smplstk> NewtonianB: add e.preventDefault() in your click function, see if that fixes it?
[12:04:00] <smplstk> other than that, i don't know.
[12:12:04] <ShaunR> anybody help me out with this.  http://jsfiddle.net/Pa6fd/
[12:18:33] <sean`> ShaunR, that's not the way to do it
[12:18:54] <ShaunR> sean`: http://jsfiddle.net/Pa6fd/2/ this is what i got going so far.
[12:19:06] <ShaunR> for some reason if i remove that 'test' + it doesnt work though.
[12:19:14] <sean`> http://jsfiddle.net/Pa6fd/3/
[12:20:04] <ShaunR> ahh, thanks, now i just need to format it so that the date/time is cleaner looking
[12:20:05] <danzik171> ShaunR: that's because it's implicitly converting the Date to a string.  you can get the same effect by doing new Date() + ""
[12:21:27] <ShaunR> wow, to format the clock their is quiet a bit more code, i would have though it would be simpler.
[12:21:33] <trose> is it possible to make drag an drop object within an accordion that has mouseover enabled?
[12:24:04] <trose> oh nvm i see. I have to make the accordion sections droppable and then react when the object is dropped in

[12:26:41] <RedOrigin> I'm using wordpress to make a loop that puts the contents of posts into an array and then json_encode() the whole array so I can turn it into a jQuery array. But I'm messing up somehow because the json string isn't valid so it isn't parsed by jQuery.parseJSON(). Would someone mind taking a look at my code to see why it's isn't working http://pastebin.com/2H1gJM2W
[12:27:58] <skamikaze> RedOrigin: what's the output of json_encode?
[12:28:10] <skamikaze> RedOrigin: fired up firebug yet?

[12:35:09] <james13433> anybody know a decent alkternative to console.log?
[12:35:49] <devc> james13433: alert(); haha
[12:36:02] <james13433> devc :(
[12:36:12] <devc> james13433: what's wrong with console.log()?
[12:36:41] <james13433> devc, its not working inside a prototype function for some unkown reason.
[12:37:46] <devc> james13433: Have you just used breakpoints instead?
[12:37:53] <devc> or tried that? That's what I would do.
[12:47:47] <magcius> What would be the easiest way to sort elements by some comparison function without losing events on them?
[12:48:19] <magcius> https://github.com/magcius/sweettooth/blob/master/sweettooth/static/js/messages.js is what I want to do -- unfortunately, we lose events
[12:50:24] <oodavid> magcius: could using .live() be a solution for you? Thus any events would be re-registered after a sort
[12:51:33] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yesh
[12:51:39] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: I'm here
[12:52:09] <anvandare> Great. :) I'm still struggling with the interaction between the draggable and the sortable. Could you give me the link again you gave yesterday?
[12:53:12] <anvandare> So far the closest I could get to making it work without too many side-effects is adding an "unset" class to the draggables before they're copied to the sortable. However, if I try to remove the class once they're appended to the sortable, they get copied whenever I try to move them to another sortable...
[12:53:21] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: sure, http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[12:53:32] <anvandare> Thanks. My buffer was too short to retain it.
[12:54:38] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: np, book mark that isht
[12:55:19] <anvandare> Yup, it gives me the same error I struggled with yesterday
[12:55:20] <anvandare> "d(this).data("draggable") is undefined"
[12:55:27] <anvandare> however, everything still _works_ :/
[12:55:46] <ryanneufeld> well, there is no data('draggable')
[12:55:53] <magcius> oodavid, I'd really like to not do that if possible.
[12:55:58] <ryanneufeld> it's ui.item.draggable
[12:56:25] <devc> Whirl3d: Are you around? Or not until after work?
[12:56:35] <anvandare> indeed, which makes me suspect it's a jquery bug, more than my own failings.
[12:56:48] <imsky> nonsense, jquery has no bugs
[12:57:29] <ProLoser|Work> sup shladies
[12:57:35] <ProLoser|Work> need more djs on turntable: http://turntable.fm/freenode
[12:58:01] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: I think you're doing it wrong
[12:58:24] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: unless you set the data('draggable'), it won't be there
[12:59:16] <anvandare> No, it works now... the trick was indeed to register the dragged item with beforeStop before switching it and the original with receive
[12:59:42] <anvandare> now the originals are copied (with id and data) and they move around the sortables flawlessly
[12:59:51] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: yeah, that's the trick I found
[12:59:59] <anvandare> Thanks for it. :)
[13:00:08] <ryanneufeld> anvandare: np
[13:03:00] <barraponto> is there a plugin that turns <select> into <ul> but keeps the form functionality?
[13:05:03] <atrigent> hey guys
[13:05:15] <atrigent> I'm getting an issue where $.support.cors is false in ie8
[13:05:25] <trose> best way to have draggable elements in an accordion and be able to drag between panels? right now the element no longer follows my cursor when i move between panes. Maybe it's a depth issue?
[13:05:26] <atrigent> but setting $.support.cors = true causes cors to start working
[13:08:02] <atrigent> so it seems that jquery can use XDomainRequest in ie8, but it doesn't count that as cors support?
[13:08:05] <atrigent> kind of strange
[13:08:09] <kborchers> trose: this should be what you want or at least get you started http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs
[13:09:25] <trose> kborchers, that looks about right. Thank you
[13:09:52] <kborchers> trose: yeah, it's tabs not accordion but should get you on the right track
[13:10:21] <trose> kborchers, well i should be able to make the accordion headers droppable instead of the tabs
[13:10:39] <kborchers> yep
[13:11:29] <EdwardIII> hey
[13:11:32] <EdwardIII> must be doing something stupi dhere
[13:12:10] <trose> kborchers, ideally i'd be able to drag an item over, have the tab open on hover and drop it where i want right away
[13:13:13] <kborchers> i would think that should be possible trose
[13:13:34] <trose> kborchers, yep. just gotta put two and two together now
[13:13:39] <trose> kborchers, thanks for the link
[13:14:20] <kborchers> trose: no problem. probably a combo of my first link and this one http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#mouseover
[13:14:21] <EdwardIII> line 20 returns a number, but line 26 returns  https://gist.github.com/1328750
[13:15:30] <trose> :D
[13:15:37] <EdwardIII> returns 'undefined'
[13:15:39] <EdwardIII> i'm totally bamboozled
[13:18:35] <EdwardIII> flippin' stupid, typoed on the function's name
[13:18:40] <ShaunR> is this seriously how i have to do this... http://jsfiddle.net/Pa6fd/6/
[13:19:03] <anvandare> My sortable seems to be 'jittery': it goes on and off very fast... but not when I drag into it from another place. Any idea what might be causing this?
[13:19:28] <EdwardIII> ah wait doesn't matter, it was consistently mispelt
[13:21:08] <trose> kborchers, lol I may just switch to a tab interface
[13:21:30] <kborchers> that would be easier since it's already written ;)
[13:21:52] <jondot> hi guys. i'm looking for a wysiwyg editor, but not for test -- for the page layout itself (add boxes, resize, position)
[13:22:00] <jondot> any one knows such a thing?
[13:22:00] <trose> kborchers, I could mod the tab example to support hovering
[13:24:07] <impi> if i hhave this function getEventOptions() { // do stuff function getOption { //do more stuff } } - how do i call getOption?
[13:24:36] <impi> or do i have the cat by the ear?
[13:25:22] <anvandare> Figures, it's my code that's doing it.
[13:25:26] * anvandare sighs and rubs his temples.
[13:26:39] <impi> anvandare, grab a coffee and jam this.. http://soundcloud.com/schitz-popinov/schitz-popinov-presents-sunday
[13:26:42] <impi> good luck dude
[13:27:29] <anvandare> Thanks, but not really my style. :P
[13:27:46] * anvandare prefers loud music to vent his frustrations.
[13:27:52] <impi> heh :P
[13:28:04] <anvandare> e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW1Uc-grcMs
[13:37:29] <molavy> why i can get value from input i can't set focus on it, when i set focus on it nothing happen
[13:39:27] <JKarsrud> whut?
[13:40:16] <ColKurtz> does jquery support the 'toggle' event for delegate?
[13:41:49] <molavy> i check my selector with console.log((this).val()) and it return it's value but when i set focus with .focus() nothing happen , don't set focus on input
[13:41:57] <Jon47> ColKurtz - i wasn't aware that "toggle" was an event?
[13:42:03] <andrew9183> am i supposed to not be able to do an $('iframe').contents() ?
[13:42:03] <ColKurtz> it is.
[13:42:13] <Jon47> what elements does it get triggered from?
[13:42:15] <ColKurtz> it's a click event that toggles which function it uses
[13:42:30] <ColKurtz> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[13:43:14] <Jon47> I think that's a convenience method, not an actual event in the browser
[13:43:33] <ColKurtz> well yes. it's a jquery event
[13:43:46] <ColKurtz> so is "click" isn't it
[13:43:47] <ColKurtz> ?
[13:44:39] <ColKurtz> er nevermind
[13:44:41] <ColKurtz> lol
[13:47:24] <anvandare> Well, that was... Surprisingly sollutative.
[13:47:38] <anvandare> Just don't make the tasks draggable.
[14:03:10] <maena> Hi, is there some API (jQuery or just JS) that allows me to easily add a parameter to a frame?
[14:03:18] <maena> like, addParameter or something
[14:06:43] <context> like change the location ?
[14:07:17] <savage-> hi
[14:07:29] <savage-> what are people using for a jquery browser/OS detection plugin these days?
[14:08:07] <jedimind> modernizr
[14:08:19] <jedimind> its not browser/os detection, but more feature detection
[14:08:21] <jedimind> which is the way you should be going
[14:09:26] <andrew9183> anyone know why something like this won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/7r9gq/
[14:10:42] <luite> andrew9183: not allowed by browsers
[14:11:51] <andrew9183> is there a proper way to do it ?
[14:12:03] <luite> download the page to your own server first
[14:12:52] <andrew9183> so if i did it on a page on the same domain, it would work, right ?
[14:13:17] <luite> yeah I think it would
[14:15:28] <andrew9183> hmmm, i tried it but didnt work
[14:22:47] <luite> andrew9183: works here http://jsfiddle.net/7r9gq/1/
[14:30:20] <smplstk> luite: it works there, because it's the same domain
[14:32:00] <luite> smplstk: yes, I just told andrew9183 that it only works from the same domain
[14:32:21] <luite> he said that he tried it but that it didn't work
[14:32:24] <andrew9183> hmm i must be doing something funky
[14:32:28] <andrew9183> alert($("iframe").contents().find("h1").text());
[14:32:36] <andrew9183> that's not working for me.  is that syntactically ok ?
[14:34:24] <luite> hmm, looks ok, I think :)
[14:36:17] <andrew9183> could it be that i need to wait for the iframe to load?
[14:36:17] <andrew9183> or does it do it asynchronously ?
[14:36:52] <smplstk> andrew9183: yes, you need to have it load.
[14:38:14] <andrew9183> hmm
[14:41:13] <smplstk> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/7r9gq/4/
[14:48:49] <mapper99> Is it possible to retrieve the results of an asynchronous call using jquery?  I need to get the results of a callback function and can't seem to do it using return - http://pastebin.com/JeHEcf6W
[14:50:34] <ShaunR> how can I turn getMonth from date into the month spelling?
[14:51:08] <anvandare> return ["january","february",...][date.getMonth];
[14:51:56] <anvandare> mapper99: asynchronous functions are exactly that, asynchronous... so unless you pass it along a place to store its data, there's no getting a reply.
[14:54:21] <Silowyi> huh, today I found out about protocol relative urls
[14:55:16] <andrew9183> ok i got a brainteaser for you guys
[14:55:21] <andrew9183> it is supposed to work, right ?
[14:55:36] <andrew9183> if i do an alert(this) before the actual call to get the title, it works.  seen here: http://andrew.itracmediav5.com/editor.html
[14:55:50] <andrew9183> but if i omit the alert(this), it will display an empty text box as seen here: http://andrew.itracmediav5.com/editor1.html
[14:55:53] <andrew9183> can anyone explain why ?
[14:56:26] <andrew9183> weird, only firefox grabs the title..  chrome fails on both pages
[14:57:19] <mapper99> ah, that makes sense...so, I could store the results in a hidden location on my page?
[14:57:47] <Silowyi> andrew9183: you seem to have a misconception about when $("#iframe").ready is firing
[14:58:24] <andrew9183> yeah i see what you mean
[14:58:58] <andrew9183> am i understanding correctly that the iframe page must be loaded until i can pull data from it?
[14:59:15] <andrew9183> ie, if i make a call to the title, it won't wait for it to retrieve it ?
[14:59:22] <Silowyi> Well iframe.ready fires when the iframe is ready, not when the document inside has finished loading
[14:59:55] <Silowyi> what you probably want is to use the load event
[15:00:11] <Silowyi> there is an iframe document ready plugin though
[15:01:20] <andrew9183> oh
[15:01:20] <andrew9183> hmmm
[15:01:23] <andrew9183> that would explain it
[15:01:29] <andrew9183> thanks for explanation Silo
[15:01:42] <Silowyi> or you could just register a callback on loading the content in the iframe
[15:02:04] <andrew9183> what's the plugin called ?
[15:03:31] <Silowyi> like you could do $("#iframe").load(url,function (){ do stuff });
[15:06:14] <Silowyi> can't find the plugin anymore, it was called iFrame Document Ready
[15:08:42] <andrew9183> k thanks Silo
[15:08:43] <andrew9183> it works :0
[15:08:44] <andrew9183> :)
[15:16:34] <sethuhdiah> whats the best/quickest fix for IE to recognize calling the click event
[15:17:00] <skamikaze> ??
[15:17:05] <skamikaze> ?click @ sethuhdiah
[15:17:06] <bot-t> sethuhdiah, .click(handler): Bind an event handler to the "click" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:17:41] <skamikaze> sethuhdiah: or fiddle around with attachEvent
[15:18:50] <ProLoser|Work> how can i have an iframe communicate with a container?
[15:43:55] <cogman> $.post is calling the promise "failed()" when it gets a 302 return code, how can I tell it to follow the redirection and that everything is going to be alright.
[15:43:56] <cogman> ?
[15:45:02] <cogman> err. the promise is fail(), not failed().. Sorry bout that.
[15:45:47] <anvandare> match up with .error(),
[15:46:15] <cogman> anvandare: error is supposed to be deprecated in 1.8
[15:46:27] <anvandare> hmm, sure?
[15:46:36] <bjoern_> i have an object with standard key value. How can I use a dynamic key name? http://jsfiddle.net/5VxvK/
[15:47:23] <anvandare> ok then, the note says to use jqXHR.fail() instead
[15:47:23] <Jon47> bjoern_
[15:47:24] <cogman> anvandare: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ Follow down to the "Deprecation Notice"
[15:47:28] <Jon47> use array notation
[15:47:38] <Jon47> error[obj1.param]
[15:48:22] <Jon47> actually I think i misunderstood the question..
[15:49:01] <cogman> anvandare: The problem is, fail is called when the server returns 302. I want treat it like a success.
[15:49:09] <Jon47> obj2.errors[obj1.param] = error.message
[15:49:15] <Jon47> kind of messy but i believe it will work
[15:49:53] <anvandare> then have the fail redirect the code if equal to 302 to the success function?
[15:51:14] <cogman> anvandare: How do I check that status code in javascript and what do I need to do to follow the redirection? Is the done automatically by the browser or is there some special voodoo javascript magic that I need?
[15:53:58] <skamikaze> ?Deferred @ cogman
[15:53:59] <bot-t> cogman, http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[15:54:08] <skamikaze> the magic there ;)
[15:54:23] <anvandare> cogman: i'm guessing the 'status' part of the jqXHR object will contain the error code
[15:54:55] <skamikaze> cogman: fail gets that parameters: event, jqXHR, thrownError
[15:55:08] <anvandare> or that
[15:55:10] <skamikaze> ?ajaxError @ cogman
[15:55:11] <bot-t> cogman, .ajaxError(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete with an error. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[15:56:15] <cogman> skamikaze & anvandare: Thanks, this looks to be what I'm looking for.  Does the jqXHR object also contain the redirection page/data?
[15:56:46] <anvandare> yes, as responseText/XML
[15:57:33] <cogman> anvandare: Ok, thanks, I'll go play with that.. Thanks again everyone.
[15:57:47] <skamikaze> cogman: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide4
[16:09:29] <devc> Whirl3d: Are you around?
[16:14:47] <thebignoise> question. i have a bunch of fucntion in my $(document).ready but when i make an ajax call those function are no longer in affective. so i recall them after the ajax has finished. but that seems to put alot of strain on my jquery animations. is there a better way to do it?
[16:15:03] <skamikaze> ?delegate @ thebignoise
[16:15:04] <bot-t> thebignoise, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:15:09] <skamikaze> ?live @ thebignoise
[16:15:09] <bot-t> thebignoise, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[16:15:29] <thebignoise> oh wow ok ill give those a look thank you skamikaze
[16:15:52] <skamikaze> yvw
[16:19:26] <thebignoise> skamikaze: im not sure thats what i am looking for, but that probably because i didnt explain my situation very well eh?
[16:21:10] <thebignoise> skamikaze: OH!!! nvm that's perfect thank you
[16:21:16] <skamikaze> :P
[16:22:07] <tokam> can elements which are in a noscript tag be found by jquery by their id?
[16:23:46] <skamikaze> tokam: what does a noscript tag do? :P
[16:24:02] <tokam> -.- :D
[16:24:09] <tokam> so I will have to work arround I seee....
[16:27:56] <tokam> wrapper.append( noscript.html() );
[16:28:04] <JasonWoof> the draggable() from jquery-ui has an option ("stack") which makes the dragged item come to the front (highest z-index). I need to be able to also bring one of those items to the front when it is not dragged, and be able to create new ones that are in front. How should I do this?
[16:28:04] <tokam> I am having the issue that the html does not get rendered here.
[16:28:17] <tokam> what can I do to be able to append the html what is inside?
[16:29:00] <ryanneufeld> jebus, everyone's working draggables
[16:29:09] <anvandare> is there an event that triggers whenever the css properties of an element change?
[16:29:23] <JasonWoof> tokam: try just wrapper.append(noscript)
[16:30:00] <tokam> it does not work, because of course no script is not shown if javascript is running
[16:30:03] <JasonWoof> tokam: ie: $('#wrapper').append($('noscript'))
[16:30:31] <JasonWoof> oh, maybe get the children?
[16:30:37] <tokam> does not show anything
[16:30:41] <JasonWoof> tokam: $('#wrapper').append($('noscript').children())
[16:30:55] <tokam> the issue is, that the noscript does not have dom elements as children
[16:31:00] <tokam> they are not validated as such :(
[16:31:14] <JasonWoof> so probably a dom issue, and not jquery?
[16:31:31] <tokam> I wanna solve this with jquery
[16:31:49] <JasonWoof> tokam: but you get something with $('noscript')?
[16:31:52] <tokam> the reason i used noscript was, that it should be shown for noscript users on default but it should be shown for javascirpt users by event
[16:32:16] <tokam> append( noscript.html() ) displayed the html code which is inside noscript
[16:32:25] <thebignoise> $("a").delegate("tag","click", function(){
[16:32:25] <thebignoise> 	alert("clicked");
[16:32:25] <thebignoise> });
[16:32:34] <thebignoise> is there something wrong with that
[16:32:45] <aksnowman> tokam: so $('#wrapper').append( $('noscript').html() ); ?
[16:32:55] <thebignoise> b/c the alert is not working. ("tag") is class selector
[16:33:05] <tokam> what is $('noscript') for?
[16:33:14] <tokam> i have it in a variable named noscript
[16:33:30] <tokam> 	wrapper.append( noscript.html() );
[16:33:31] <tokam> 	noscript.replaceWith( wrapper );
[16:33:33] <tokam> it shows the html code
[16:34:03] <gnarf> .children()
[16:34:10] <tokam> alert( noscript.html() ); shows the html code escaped with special chars
[16:34:13] <gnarf> ?children
[16:34:13] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[16:34:16] <tokam> &lt;div class="field"&gt;&lt;label for="p-companyname" class="optional"&gt;Firma&lt;/label&gt;
[16:34:23] <gnarf> tokam: oh
[16:34:29] <tokam> because it is noscript
[16:34:40] <gnarf> i think noscript is a text element
[16:34:43] <gnarf> not sure
[16:34:57] <thursday> tokam: if you can get the the contents of noscript into a variable.. you should be able to copy that elsewhere (outside of noscript tags). so you can show a duplicate of that content to javascript users.
[16:35:02] <tokam> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/620896/access-contents-of-noscript-with-javascript
[16:35:03] <gnarf> ?contents
[16:35:04] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[16:35:17] <thursday> or just create duplicate content in the first place and be done with it.
[16:35:40] <gnarf> or instead of noscript
[16:35:42] <gnarf> rely on css
[16:35:58] <gnarf> <div class="something"></div>
[16:36:13] <JasonWoof> tokam: how about: $('#wrapper').append($('<div/>').html($('noscript').html()))
[16:36:31] <gnarf> css: .something { display: block; } body.has-js .something { display: hidden; }
[16:36:51] <gnarf> JasonWoof: thats just getting ugly
[16:36:56] <gnarf> there are less ugly workarounds
[16:37:07] <JasonWoof> he didn't ask for pretty
[16:37:09] <thursday> gnarf has a point. instead of noscript, set the content in a div with display: none.. and use jquery to display it.. then if they have js turned off, it wont display.
[16:37:12] <JasonWoof> >;-)
[16:37:26] <gnarf> actually my point it
[16:37:27] <gnarf> is
[16:37:38] <JasonWoof> thursday: other way around, but besically, yeah
[16:37:38] <gnarf> give it a class in the raw html, which is displayed
[16:37:43] <gnarf> then HIDE it via js
[16:37:48] <gnarf> by changing the class
[16:37:49] <aksnowman> thursday: he was saying he wants it to display if a user has no javascript, but not display until the javascript says to if javascript *is* enabled, I believe?
[16:37:52] <gnarf> to something hidden
[16:38:09] <gnarf> anyway - gotta run
[16:38:13] <gnarf> css is the best solution here
[16:38:16] <aksnowman> gnarf: for that, it'd just need to be $('#noscriptContainer').hide() no?
[16:38:18] <thursday> ok. i am upside down! yay.
[16:38:33] <JasonWoof> trouble with this technique, is you may get a flash of the noscript thing before javascript kicks in (as the page is loading)
[16:38:34] <aksnowman> thursday: lol
[16:38:37] <gnarf> aksnowman: that works too yeah
[16:39:15] <gnarf> JasonWoof: not if you <script>$("body").addClass("has-js");</script> right after you open the <body> tag
[16:39:17] <aksnowman> JasonWoof: well, w/ any other javascript method, it would show before the javascript kicked in too, no?
[16:39:34] <JasonWoof> gnarf: ooh, clever
[16:39:38] <aksnowman> oh, didn't think of out of $(document).ready() XD
[16:39:51] <gnarf> anyway yeah - gotta run ;)
[16:39:56] <aksnowman> later
[16:40:05] <JasonWoof> toodles
[16:42:11] <christopherbull> hey guys, variable scope question,  i've declared (within a closure) a variable which contains a function, i use this within a standard jq.val() call and it works as expected (returns its return value, however when I call this function/variable within another function/variable, it instead returns itself.  This is obviously me not understanding JS variable scope, but can anyone help explain this behaviour? (both function/variables
[16:42:11] <christopherbull> were declared with var)
[16:44:14] <thursday> christopherbull: even if it does return itself, can you run it through eval() ?
[16:45:06] <christopherbull> thursday: nope, returns NaN
[16:45:42] <christopherbull> http://pastie.org/2790843
[16:45:45] <christopherbull> there's the code
[16:46:32] <benji1231> Hi, anyone knows a good jquery plugin to create custom select box?
[16:47:55] <thursday> christopherbull: is it computer_totals you are trying to access elsewhere?.. I find globals can get tricky so a dirty work around is to append globals as properties of the global window object... like so:
[16:48:10] <thursday> window.computer_totals = function(){       };
[16:48:27] <christopherbull> thursday: no totals calculation is the problem
[16:48:33] <christopherbull> in averages_calculation
[16:48:54] <tokam> why does element.show() show all elements inside the element?
[16:48:55] <christopherbull> it works when I sub totals_calculation for an int
[16:52:06] <thursday> christopherbull: as I understand it you are basically working inside an object, so why not use 'this'?
[16:52:19] <christopherbull> oh, ofcourse
[16:52:31] <christopherbull> like this.totals_calculation?
[16:53:59] <thursday> yeah, but since averages_calculation is itself an object.. i'm getting lost in the scoping myself ;)
[16:54:26] <message144> Hi, Is there a way to get a list of previously defined event handlers for a jquery object or element?
[17:03:36] <acidjazz> whats the best fix for when u have divs in divs and the most inner div margin is making the outer divs inherit that margin?
[17:04:24] <erichynds> that's how CSS works
[17:04:39] <acidjazz> well i want the outer divs to not inherit the margin ive given the inner one
[17:05:14] <erichynds> by inherit you mean collapsing margins?
[17:05:56] <acidjazz> yea .. i know if i change it to padding thatll fix it
[17:06:05] <acidjazz> but just wondering if theres a more appropiate way
[17:06:08] <erichynds> set a larger margin on the inner div
[17:06:23] <erichynds> #css would know better..
[17:13:12] <tokam> does jquery have something equal than here?
[17:44:24] <asdf`> Hi. If I have an array with some dom elements names (say ['a','b']) and i want to $.each over these elements, I am supposed to select '#'+x? String concatenation feels weird here.
[17:44:31] <gnarf> christopherbull: http://pastie.org/2790843 was you right?
[17:44:43] <gnarf> christopherbull: eval( totals_calculation ) is a bad idea
[17:44:48] <christopherbull> yep
[17:44:48] <gnarf> you should avoid eval at all costs
[17:44:55] <christopherbull> i know, that was just a test
[17:44:58] <gnarf> if you want to execute the function - totals_calculation() works fine :)
[17:45:07] <christopherbull> gah
[17:45:09] <christopherbull> ofc
[17:45:11] <gnarf> what was the issue ?
[17:45:14] <christopherbull> yep!
[17:45:27] <christopherbull> js' variables holding functions always gets me
[17:45:35] <thursday> lol
[17:45:41] <gnarf> christopherbull: functions ARE objects...
[17:45:56] <gnarf> even function named() { }; is a "variable"
[17:46:01] <christopherbull> yeah, is function_name and function_name() equiv?
[17:46:30] <gnarf> christopherbull: no, "function_name" is the function itself, function_name() calls the function
[17:46:41] <christopherbull> that explains it
[17:46:56] <christopherbull> curious then why it works in my val calls?
[17:47:01] <gnarf> christopherbull: for .val() you can actually pass a function :)
[17:47:13] <christopherbull> ahh ofc
[17:47:15] <gnarf> .val( function( index, element ) { return something; } );
[17:47:15] <christopherbull> closures
[17:47:28] <christopherbull> so i'm basically echoing the fn into that!
[17:47:35] <christopherbull> (crudely put)
[17:47:38] <gnarf> christopherbull: echo is a horrible word
[17:47:45] <gnarf> you are passing the function to .val()
[17:48:03] <gnarf> and .val() will call the function for each matched element, passing the index in the selection and the element as arguments
[17:48:15] <gnarf> functions ARE variables
[17:48:16] <gnarf> always
[17:48:28] * thursday pats his pet dolphin lovingly.. It's ok echo, I don't think you're horrible
[17:48:33] <mattp_> do you guys know of any sexy javascript sliders like JqueryUI?
[17:48:40] <mattp_> except not jqui, since its kind of ugly? :)
[17:48:50] <gnarf> although there is probably some jackass in ES5-discuss who would argue that
[17:48:57] <gnarf> mattp_: you can style the slider in UI
[17:49:16] <gnarf> mattp_: also, it's jQuery - not Jquery ;)
[17:49:38] <christopherbull> thanks so much, just got a good lesson in JS!
[17:49:53] <gnarf> christopherbull: honestly, don't take this the wrong way - but see ?101
[17:49:53] <bot-t> christopherbull, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[17:50:02] <gnarf> christopherbull: there are SO MANY great tips in there
[17:50:57] <christopherbull> hah yeah need to give it another go.  I've spent a lot of time reading about js, (read MDC twice!) but it's always in implementation that you really learn
[17:51:29] * gnarf nods
[17:52:52] <mattp_> gnarf: faiir, thanks :)
[18:17:04] <tw2113> anyone know if append() or appendTo() would work on the <style> tag?
[18:17:11] <gnarf> tw2113: doubtful
[18:17:24] <tw2113> due to it being before the dom?
[18:17:43] <gnarf> tw2113: no - due to it being a style tag and not behaving like a normal tag
[18:17:49] <tw2113> ah
[18:17:52] <tw2113> fair enough
[18:18:17] <gnarf> tw2113: http://kentbrewster.com/creating-dynamic-stylesheets/
[18:18:24] <gnarf> i mean, that is raw JS
[18:18:32] <gnarf> but look at some of the inconsistency
[18:18:37] <gnarf> thats why
[18:19:09] <tw2113> just trying to think of an effective way to do dynamic color hovering for a link, while pulling color hex values from colourlovers.com
[18:19:16] <tw2113> and learn some js/jquery in the whole process
[18:22:21] <gnarf> tw2113: well messing with stylesheets is not an easy task in JS :)
[18:22:56] <tw2113> i was hoping for embedded, but i can understand looking too high as well :D
[18:23:11] <tw2113> one of my nights where I get an idea and run with it as far as i can go
[18:24:34] <gnarf> tw2113: why do you need to do this again?
[18:25:54] <tw2113> i don't
[18:26:40] <sgfk> I'm trying to make a little paint thing. http://jsfiddle.net/d7avm/1/ each time I draw a line, the page updates slower and slower until eventually the browser crashes. Am I doing something wrong, or is this not a feasible thing to do in jquery
[18:27:06] <Kage> I wanna learn JQuery!
[18:27:11] <sgfk> (this is my first jquery programming thing, so I still don't know what I am doing)
[18:27:58] <gnarf> sgfk: umm thats a REALLY bad way to draw shit
[18:28:02] <gnarf> you might want to look at canvas
[18:28:11] <sgfk> ok, thanks
[18:28:13] <gnarf> you're basically creating too many divs
[18:41:10] <chrizbot_> hey everyone, looking for some help with the jQuery UI datepicker: is there a way to make all past days styled differently? I checked the CSS and it doesn't look like it is differentiated right now...
[18:49:37] <gnarf> chrizbot_: there is...
[18:49:47] <gnarf> chrizbot_: one of the events is called for each day as it shows
[18:50:04] <gnarf> and it gives you an opportunity to style each day with whatever style you want
[18:50:41] <jjorpo> i'm developing a jquery plugin that uses ui.widget.js and one more javascript file. what's the conventional way to include these? make the user include everything manually or try to load everything myself?
[18:51:19] <gnarf> chrizbot_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#event-beforeShowDay
[18:51:30] <gnarf> The function takes a date as a parameter and must return an array with [0] equal to true/false indicating whether or not this date is selectable, [1] equal to a CSS class name(s) or '' for the default presentation, and [2] an optional popup tooltip for this date. It is called for each day in the datepicker before it is displayed.
[18:53:24] <chrizbot_> gnarf: ok, i'll do that, thanks!
[18:53:28] <e6nian> what would stop bind events to dom? I can't bind any events to the dom, even in the chrome console.
[18:53:45] <e6nian> by the way, there's backbone.js(0.3.3) in the project.
[18:55:28] <gnarf> e6nian: nothing
[18:56:36] <e6nian> gnarf: and how to get the events that bind to the dom? would $('#xxx').data('events') be ok?
[18:56:46] <gnarf> e6nian: what version of jQuery?
[18:57:12] <gnarf> e6nian: for debugging purposes only, that works... .data( "events" )
[18:57:27] <gnarf> however there is a bug in the 1.7 pre releases
[18:57:27] <e6nian> gnarf: 1.6.4
[18:57:35] <gnarf> it should work in 1.6.4
[18:58:10] <e6nian> gnarf: so I can't bind any events to the dom,that's wried
[18:58:53] <e6nian> gnarf: http://showoff.relife.me/ here is the demo page.
[19:02:27] <gnarf> e6nian: honestly - it seems there is a bug in .data( "events" ) there
[19:03:19] <gnarf> or hrm
[19:03:51] <gnarf> there is something very odd happening with your events there
[19:04:16] <e6nian> gnarf: yep, backbone.js(0.3.3), and has a jaml template there.
[19:04:24] <gnarf> like $( "<div>" ).data() shows a bunch of events
[19:06:59] <Chibby_> can anyone tell me the name of this jquery plugin where you can create little bordered boxes inside textareas that have an x on them to delete them?
[19:07:55] <_zoggy_> plugin? thats just some css
[19:08:32] <_zoggy_> have img, move it ontop of the text input, bind click of image to clear text
[19:11:13] <e6nian> gnarf: yep, I can see this. and find the       11: Object data: null guid: 17 handler: function (){debugger;console.log('test')} namespace: "" type: "click"
[19:11:18] <e6nian>       11: Object data: null guid: 17 handler: function (){debugger;console.log('test')} namespace: "" type: "click"
[19:12:20] <gnarf> $( "<div>" ) shouldn't have ANY events bound to it
[19:12:27] <gnarf> it should be a brand new element
[19:13:56] <e6nian> gnarf: I can see a lot of events there, which bind in the backbone app.
[19:14:01] <YammYgirlcoding> hello all o/
[19:14:07] <YammYgirlcoding> I have this page: http://solveigfloerke.com/2011/pt/teste.html
[19:14:19] <YammYgirlcoding> I want the video div to be hidden
[19:14:28] <YammYgirlcoding> and show only when i click the miniature
[19:14:43] <YammYgirlcoding> (the link calls fancybox to show video)
[19:15:06] <gnarf> e6nian: there is so much code on that site that i can't figure out what the issue might be
[19:15:16] <gnarf> i would suggest trying to create a minimal test case
[19:15:19] <YammYgirlcoding> I can set the div display:hidden, but how i put it back when i click the fancybox link ?
[19:15:29] <gnarf> plug portions of the code in until you find what is causing the actual issue
[19:16:18] <gnarf> e6nian: and i don't know much about how backbone is supposed to work either
[19:16:24] <gnarf> so maybe it makes sense in their context
[19:16:39] <gnarf> or maybe you're doing something wrong inside your backbone code
[19:17:12] <sgronblo> Is it possible to access the string returned by a script in a jsonp success callback?
[19:17:37] <_zoggy_> Chibby_, http://jsbin.com/elinu4/21/edit#javascript,html,live
[19:19:35] <e6nian> gnarf: thank you
[19:23:35] <Chibby_> _zoggy_: not like that, hmm, if you go to google image search then drag an image into the search box you can see what i mean
[19:23:59] <Chibby_> i've seen a plugin that lets you do that and have many of those little boxes inline
[19:25:58] <Chibby_> the hotmail compose email "to" field is probably a better example as you can put many of them in there
[19:34:53] <razamatan> is it acceptable to have multiple document ready blocks?
[19:38:13] <gnarf> razamatan: yes
[19:38:49] <gnarf> razamatan: usually if you are doing a component per js file you might need more than one doc ready
[19:39:03] <gnarf> there are other reasons too
[19:39:08] <razamatan> right
[19:39:10] <gnarf> but it works
[19:39:36] <razamatan> that's exactly why i ask b/c i'm factoring out the many lines of js...
[19:39:39] <razamatan> thanks
[19:49:26] <iateadonut> what do you use if you want something like an accordian but only for a single div with header?
[19:56:34] <falieson> I would like some advise.... is this double highlight flash annoying or good? http://facebookhire.me/
[19:56:45] <falieson> i'm having trouble bringing attention to the important parts of the website
[19:56:53] <falieson> aka... the like and message me area
[20:05:28] <puppen> iateadonut: knocked this together.. http://jsfiddle.net/puppen/uTkAQ/1/
[20:07:59] <puppen> falieson: imho it's comparable to the <blink> tag, which i think was deprecated for some annoying reason..
[20:08:27] <CannedCorn> hey guys
[20:08:37] <CannedCorn> when you scroll in firefox it moves the mouse
[20:08:43] <CannedCorn> but when you do it in chrome+sarfari
[20:08:45] <CannedCorn> the mouse is fixed
[20:09:08] <CannedCorn> i have this effect where posts in my blog are highlighted and whatnot when the mouse hovers over them
[20:09:16] <CannedCorn> so the effect works in firefox but not in the other browsers
[20:09:26] <CannedCorn> is that something you guys have ran into
[20:14:16] <ryanneuf_> CannedCorn: you mean the cursor moves?
[20:14:24] <CannedCorn> well
[20:14:34] <CannedCorn> it acts as thought the cursor was moving
[20:15:07] <ryanneuf_> okay
[20:15:32] <CannedCorn> you know what I'm saying
[20:15:35] <CannedCorn> you can see it on twitter
[20:15:41] <CannedCorn> open it in chrome and ff
[20:15:49] <CannedCorn> and when you scroll over tweets
[20:15:57] <CannedCorn> firefox highlights them as you scrol
[20:15:59] <ryanneuf_> that's a FF thing then
[20:16:00] <CannedCorn> scroll
[20:16:09] <gnarf> CannedCorn: its just how scroll/mouse events work
[20:16:11] <CannedCorn> chrome+safari highlight them one by one
[20:16:21] <CannedCorn> can i mimic the ff way in the other browsers
[20:16:27] <CannedCorn> or is there a better way to do that
[20:16:38] <gnarf> CannedCorn: kind of
[20:17:17] <CannedCorn> hah
[20:17:17] <ryanneuf_> CannedCorn: that's browser behaviour
[20:17:21] <CannedCorn> right
[20:17:41] <gnarf> CannedCorn: you can recalculate your mouse positions on the scroll event
[20:17:43] <CannedCorn> but jquery usually has a way of making that irrelevant with other aspects of the browser
[20:17:47] <gnarf> but like - it wont trigger mouseout etc
[20:17:53] <CannedCorn> right
[20:18:04] <CannedCorn> interesting that it isn't consistent no?
[20:18:10] <huntedmitch> Hey guys. I am tracking mouseenter and mouseleave states to display a tooltip. Unfortunately the tooltip and the item being hovered overlap slight so when the mouse goes over the tooltip it flickers. Is there a trick to get around this without using hover?
[20:18:18] <fatmandown> hi. i'm just finishing an advanced javascript course and I've got a pretty good handle on it as a whole. I want to learn about jquery, can someone point me to a good resource?
[20:18:30] <fatmandown> i'm not opposed to spending money on a book.
[20:18:45] <gnarf> CannedCorn: its an unspecified region of the spec
[20:19:00] <ryanneuf_> ?g tiptip @huntedmitch
[20:19:01] <bot-t> huntedmitch, TipTip jQuery Plugin - Code | Drew Wilson.com - http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/tiptip-jquery-plugin
[20:19:23] <ryanneuf_> ?docs @ fatmandown
[20:19:26] <gnarf> fatmandown: api.jquery.com
[20:19:27] <bot-t> fatmandown, Main Page - There are a number of alternative resources for browsing the API. http://docs.jquery.com/
[20:19:41] <ryanneuf_> ?hi5 @ gnarf
[20:19:42] <bot-t> gnarf, ⁵
[20:19:56] <gnarf> fatmandown: jQuery is it's API :) -- there is a new site coming soon http://learning.jquery.com
[20:19:59] <gnarf> but its not up yet ;)
[20:20:38] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com
[20:20:42] <gnarf> thats the github repo
[20:20:52] <gnarf> there is a good amount of content in there
[20:21:21] <fatmandown> gnarf, ryanneuf_: ty. from what i've understood, jquery is awesome for implementing different design features?
[20:21:25] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/web-learn-jquery-com/blob/master/content/code-organization/concepts.md for example fatmandown
[20:21:38] <gnarf> fatmandown: jQuery makes heavy use of method chaining
[20:21:58] <gnarf> and hass pretty expressive functional programming potential
[20:22:09] <ryanneuf_> fatmandown: jquery simplifies a lot of things, and lowers the barrier of entry to the JS world
[20:22:25] <fatmandown> excellent.
[20:22:31] <falieson> puppen: heh... so is that positive or negative?
[20:22:37] <huntedmitch> ryanneuf_: Appreciate the link, but not really relevant.
[20:22:45] <fatmandown> i've just finished advanced courses on php, sql and javascript.
[20:22:55] <fatmandown> got a bit of time off from school, figure i might as well pick up something relevant.
[20:24:13] <gnarf> fatmandown: I learned most of my jQuery from sitting in this channel and watching people ask/answer questions about it ;)
[20:24:35] <gnarf> fatmandown: that and reading the source
[20:25:17] <ryanneufeld> fatmandown: I learned it from implementing it live, reading blogs, and from guys like gnarf, ajpiano and the like helping me out in this channel
[20:25:29] <ryanneufeld> fatmandown: I recommend jsfiddle as a playground
[20:25:30] <danzik17> gnarf: is the new user site going to be user contributable?
[20:25:43] <gnarf> danzik17: learning ?
[20:25:45] <gnarf> its a git repo
[20:25:49] <gnarf> pull requests yo
[20:25:50] <gnarf> ;)
[20:25:56] <ryanneufeld> <3 git
[20:26:17] <danzik17> ah that's the ticket eh.   didn't know if it was going to be wiki style eventually or how contributions were done
[20:40:32] <CannedCorn> gnarf so there isn't really anything i can do about that eh
[20:40:37] <ryanneufeld> no
[20:40:51] <gnarf> CannedCorn: nothing we (jQuery) can do about it either
[20:41:00] <CannedCorn> ok thanks
[20:41:44] <ryanneufeld> CannedCorn: is this just to make it the same all browsers? Cause that's not a thing people do anymore :p
[20:41:49] <fatmandown> ryanneufeld, I used JSfiddle for my javascript but I didn't know it'd execute jquery too
[20:41:58] <ryanneufeld> yeah, check out the left panel
[20:42:13] <CannedCorn> ryanneufeld hah yeah
[20:43:20] <ryanneufeld> CannedCorn: don't worry about it then, cause most users, only use one browser
[20:43:39] <fatmandown> except other web designers =D
[20:43:56] <CannedCorn> i could care less… it's my boss that wants it that way
[20:44:15] <ryanneufeld> show him this: http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[20:47:35] <fatmandown> are there any US web designers in here?
[20:48:15] <domino14> where does listing 5 have the DOM element reference the javascript obj? http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-memleak/
[20:49:50] <danzik17> domino14: the event handler is referencing the dom element causing the leak in IE from what i understand
[20:51:01] <fatmandown> i'm finishing up my AS degree in web design from a community college and i'm not sure I want to go for my full BS in computer science.
[20:51:58] <amh345> anyone here use jQuery SWFObject?   im having problems playing from a specific frame in a function.
[20:52:01] <danzik17> fatmandown: get an internship if you don't want to get a full BS.  i will say if you want to pursue a career in this, you might regret not finishing out though.
[20:53:22] <iateadonut> how much do you make an hour if you have a BS?
[20:53:49] <CannedCorn> is this syntax correct? $(".place a").animate({ color: "#FFFFFF" }, 650);
[20:55:17] <fatmandown> danzik17: i'm in a bit of an odd position. i mucked up my first two years at a real uni, ended up at the community college i'm at now.
[20:56:08] <fatmandown> I figure that I should finish out and get the BS because it's worth it but there's got to be another route- I can't keep on going to school and making minimum wage
[20:57:48] <danzik17> fatmandown: get an internship somewhere.  but i will say that i changed my focus from comp sci to network engineering, but now i half regret it since i dont have the understanding of algorithms and whatnot that i might have - you might find yourself in a similar position.
[21:00:22] <CannedCorn> for some reason it isn't animating my color
[21:18:04] <gnarf> e6nian: you still here?
[21:57:06] <amh345> anyone here use jQuery SWFObject?  im having problems playing from a specific frame in a function.
[22:00:01] <molavy> how can i catch all error globally, i want know which error are popular for users so , i want when any error happen send info to special url
[22:00:37] <CannedCorn> are any of you guys familiar with geolocation stuff?
[22:00:57] <Cork> molavy: $(window).bind('error')
[22:01:23] <Cork> youll get all errors that isn't catched by try that is
[22:13:36] <MaximusColourum> Hmm. can anyone explain why I can change a form input value with $j('#target').val('new text'); but cannot focus on it with $j('#target').focus();  ?
[22:16:17] <Cork> cause focus is a dom function
[22:16:24] <Cork> $j('#target')[0].focus();
[22:16:55] <MaximusColourum> Ah, a dom function. I see.
[22:18:41] <MaximusColourum> Is there any way to set focus and then fake a key entry?
[22:19:22] <MaximusColourum> I've got this listener that is bound to an input field and when the field text is changed, it passed the field var to a flash object.
[22:19:25] <Cork> MaximusColourum: never tried, by my instinc instantly tell me no
[22:19:35] <Cork> browsers normally block faking of user actions
[22:19:40] <Cork> -of
[22:19:41] <MaximusColourum> hmmm.
[22:19:56] <Cork> but you could try it with .keypress()
[22:20:00] <Cork> donno if it works though
[22:22:11] <MaximusColourum> yea, that is a no go.
[22:22:29] <MaximusColourum> If I could only figure out what event listeners is attached to the input field.
[22:22:48] <MaximusColourum> these are loaded off site by a third party js code
[22:27:27] <Cork> MaximusColourum: but why do you have to send a key event?
[22:27:35] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[22:27:41] <MaximusColourum> you wanna see?
[22:28:02] <Cork> not really, but most of the time you don't need the event, thats why i asked :)
[22:29:47] <rabbi1> any theme suggestion, which takes less screen space
[22:29:49] <rabbi1>  ?
[22:30:20] <rabbi1> Please IGNORE :)
[22:30:28] <MaximusColourum> it would be hard to explain really, but the gist is that there is a third party image flash object with an eternal form that loads on this page and lets you enter personalization text and displays it over the image. I record the personalization text in the form, stick it in a hidden text area inside html. I go to the cart, go to edit the product to change personalization text, but when the object loads the text on the
[22:30:28] <MaximusColourum> image does not change, even though I can populate the input field with the right text.
[22:31:24] <MaximusColourum> so, even though the text is inside the input field, the image object won't update till I click the input filed and type something else.
[22:31:46] <Cork> MaximusColourum: might be you need to trigger a keydown or keyup event
[22:32:02] <MaximusColourum> I tried keypress...
[22:32:22] <Cork> ya, but many developers doesn't bind keypress for some idiotic reason
[22:32:34] <MaximusColourum> great point
[22:32:56] <jblue> Howdy all. Has anyone noticed odd behavior in iOS 5 wrt using .live('click') events? The events I'm attaching are just not firing.
[22:33:00] <Cork> commonly keyup is binded instead, though it catches much less
[22:33:09] <e6nian> gnarf: yeah, I'm here
[22:33:42] <e6nian> gnarf: :) any progress?
[22:36:35] <MaximusColourum> COrk, you got it for me. swf.SetVariable is not a function
[22:36:55] <Cork> heh
[22:36:58] <MaximusColourum> which I am guessing being thrown since a keyup is happening prior to the object being completly loaded
[22:37:31] <Cork> try calling if from .load() ?
[22:39:09] <MaximusColourum> what from load?
[22:39:18] <MaximusColourum> This is all in a fancy box modal btw
[22:39:20] <MaximusColourum> hehe
[22:41:10] <Cork> MaximusColourum: either from the document load event (instead of dom ready) of or if the flash obejct submits one from it
[22:41:51] <MaximusColourum> Yea, I'm looking for the flash submitted one, but I think I'm gonna do doc read
[22:43:17] <amh345> ok. i give up on jquery swf object.  can anyone recommend a flash/swf plugin for jquery?
[22:43:48] <amh345> i just need to embed a swf and pass/send some js
[22:44:16] <Cork> amh345: why do you need a plugin at all?
[22:45:18] <amh345> well i started with jquery swf object because it did all sorts of stuff.  so i guess i needed it just because it was there.  im quit terrible and frustrated with flash at the moment so i just wanted the quickest solution possible.
[22:45:44] <Cork> amh345: i normally write it my self, but many use http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/
[22:45:52] <amh345> i mean, it's done pretty much everything i need. except for ONE lousy thing.
[22:46:04] <Cork> i don't really see a need for a jquery plugin to wrap that another time
[22:46:40] <amh345> mind if i ask you a question not related to jquery?  im striking out everywhere and rather desperate.
[22:47:13] <Cork> amh345: sure, but if its js related #javascript is a better place
[22:47:23] <e6nian> gnarf: any suggestion about that?
[22:47:37] <amh345> i dont know what it's realted to.  im lost. it's either jquery/ js or actionscript.
[22:47:50] <amh345> but the AS rooms are deader than dead
[22:47:54] <Cork> heh, ecmascript related then :)
[22:48:11] <amh345> what's ecmascript?
[22:48:26] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ amh345
[22:48:27] <bot-t> amh345, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:48:28] <Cork> amh345: javascript is the mozilla implementation of ecmascript
[22:48:38] <ryanneufeld> Cork: you're kinda wrong
[22:48:40] <Cork> ecmascript is the name of the standard
[22:49:03] <Cork> ryanneufeld: nowdays its a bit bigger then that, yes but originaly it was
[22:49:07] <ryanneufeld> Cork: java script was what it was called before it was ecma
[22:49:23] <Cork> yes, but its still just a name on an implementation
[22:49:34] <Cork> and that was my point
[22:49:57] <amh345> ryanneufeld: ok, ill ask (i did ask earlier).   jquery swf object.   this.Play()   i cant seem to target a frame or frame label in an swf.  and im unsure of where the problem lies.
[22:50:14] <ryanneufeld> amh345: you have to enable the JS connection in AS
[22:50:48] <KeyLimePi> Hello
[22:51:45] <amh345> see, that's the thing that's got me confused. because im not enabling anything.  but it seems to send  almost randomly too the swf.  like, it'll play the next frame... or sometimes it plays from the beginning of the swf.  i cant figure the rhythm or reason to it.   i figured if something wasnt enabled in AS- i would get no interaction what-so-ever. but that's not the case.
[22:51:49] <amh345> ryanneufeld: ^
[22:52:25] <amh345> and im sending the instructions to the swf via jquery .click functions.
[22:53:44] <ryanneufeld> amh345: this might help you http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flash/articles/external_interface.html
[22:53:58] <amh345> hah.  i JUST loaded the page via googlefu.
[22:54:02] <ryanneufeld> you need some flags on the object/embed
[22:54:12] <ryanneufeld> and you need to have the right libs loaded in your AS
[22:54:54] <amh345> i see lots of info on sending to JS (which works in my app). but i cant find the receiving JS stuff.
[22:56:36] <ryanneufeld> amh345: The ExternalInterface.addCallback() method registers custom ActionScript methods so that they can be called from JavaScript. Previously, you could call only a limited number of built-in Flash Player functions, but now by using ExternalInterface.addCallback(), you can directly call custom functions that are defined in your SWF. In addition, you can pass any number of parameters of any supported data type.
[22:56:39] <ryanneufeld> from that page
[22:56:41] <ryanneufeld> scroll down
[22:57:08] <KeyLimePi> anyone know how to get qtip2 to work with a dynamic array?
[22:57:29] <ryanneufeld> any how
[22:57:33] <ryanneufeld> I'm off for the night
[22:57:38] <ryanneufeld> good luck amh345
[22:57:59] <amh345> thanks dude. i appreciate the guidance
[23:00:36] <tregeagle> Hi folks. I'm having problems with a page jumping when I am using the click function. I've tried using event.preventDefault(); and return false; but they don't fix it what am I missing?
[23:01:02] <tregeagle> The code looks sort of like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tregeagle/ejQES/22/
[23:01:37] <tregeagle> although that does not seem to work in jsfiddle
[23:07:51] <Onions> What's the difference between $(this).id and this.id? THey return different things occasionally o.0
[23:08:12] <context> onions: this is the this element. $(this) is a jquery object
[23:08:48] <Onions> righht
[23:09:16] <context> .id im assuming is the object id, which is probably useless the majority of the time (at least to you) and is most likely always different
[23:14:02] <impi> anyone here using jquery mobile and datebox?
[23:37:11] <encompass> Not sure if this a place to ask this, but I am sure you could at least get me in the right direction.  I have a page that I need to lead in an iframe, is there a way to check if the page loads without a 404 error before displaying it?
[23:43:18] <devaholic> what loads the page?
