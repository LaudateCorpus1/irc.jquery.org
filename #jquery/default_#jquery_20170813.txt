[06:19:17] <seven-eleven> why is res != res2 ? http://dpaste.com/294112N
[09:50:05] <shoky_> seven-eleven: because they are not equal :p one is the resolved value of dec, the other is a promise (.then returns a promise)
[12:05:18] <seven-eleven> shoky_, so it's not possible to return a variable inside then to the outer scope, but instead i have to wrap code that relies on variables inside .then() into the then() parenthesis too?
[12:29:17] <shoky_> seven-eleven: yep. you can pass the promise around though and call .then wherever you want.  e.g.  var promise = x.then(function() { ... return 'foo'; });    ...  promise.then(function(res) {  res === 'foo' })
[12:29:59] <shoky_> whatever you return inside .then()  becomes the new resolve value for the newly created promise that .then returns
[12:31:11] <seven-eleven> shoky_, thanks for clarifying!
[16:47:29] <wadadli> Hey there, I am looking at some docs for a slider, which is initialized like this $(document).ready(function(){ $('.slider').slider(); });
[16:48:11] <wadadli> In the docs they mention that there are some jQuery Plugin Options such as indicators (Default: true)
[16:48:43] <wadadli> How would I format that code to include the jQuery plugin option, indicators (to disable indicators on the slider)
[16:54:40] <kof> wadadli like this $(document).ready(function(){ $('.slider').slider(Default: true, AutoPlay: off); });
[16:58:22] <wadadli> kof so $('.slider').slider(indicators: false);
[17:12:06] <funkeesapien> hey guys
[17:12:52] <funkeesapien> any idea how this jquery code is able to return the slider value: $('.slider').slider("option", "value")
[17:14:01] <funkeesapien> i'd like to do something similar in my code so i could just query the value instead of having to pass variables all over the place
[17:14:36] <funkeesapien> is there a term for how jquery accomplishes it?
