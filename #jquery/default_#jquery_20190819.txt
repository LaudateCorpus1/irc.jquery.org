[10:18:19] <btorch> I'm new to jquery and trying to setup a page with datatables, I created a Rest API service with Falcon which returns the data in json and the data is displayed fine within the datatable. The problem I'm having is that if I click another button to show different data within the datatables I can't seem to figure out how to update a header that needs to be sent to the rest api endpoint in order to get the new
[10:18:25] <btorch> data and reload it onto the table.
[10:19:46] <btorch> I know how to use the url().load to load new data if it was coming from a different url which I could register a new endpoint in falcon to return the data through that url but I would rather use http headers to tell the service what to give me back
[10:20:35] <btorch> doing datatable.ajax({"headers": {X-blah:blah}}) doesn't seem to work
[17:01:16] <engaged> I am loading a jquery modal dialog and in that modal I want some action to happen like in the modal I have a link… when I click the link the .click() won’t work or on click… for example I ajax load some html <a id=“linkMe”>Link Click</a> and I have in the original html it’s loaded from $(“#linkMe”).on(“click”,function() { alert(“clicked”); });
[17:01:35] <robertmaxrees> you need a delegated handler.
[17:01:36] <engaged> how come that doesn’t work.. i thought with the on click it would be recognized… i loaded the html ajax but nothing happens now...
[17:01:43] <engaged> what’s that mean - example?

[17:28:18] <engaged> robertmaxrees: I did .on(“click”… and it still doesn’t work though?
[17:28:29] <robertmaxrees> you didn't read the docs :)
[17:28:39] <robertmaxrees> you just skipped to the first example you saw.
[17:28:44] <robertmaxrees> which is what not to do.
[17:29:19] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/Xs5ppbb.png look at the second example.
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> .on() doesn't magically delegate for you - gotta use the second version.
[17:31:54] <robertmaxrees> engaged ^
[17:51:45] <engaged> robertmaxrees: thanks bud, got it
[17:52:29] <robertmaxrees> :) see the difference now?
[18:04:53] <engaged> yep
[18:32:27] <untitled> Hi folks. I have a big (wide) table of data on the page and I'm trying to hide some of the data into some kind of "info popup"
[18:32:38] <untitled> but I'm not sure what to use for that
[18:32:51] <robertmaxrees> you mean a tooltip?
[18:33:02] <robertmaxrees> or a modal?
[18:33:17] <untitled> more like a tooltip
[18:33:29] <untitled> which shows on a click
[18:33:51] <robertmaxrees> using any libraries or frameworks already?
[18:33:57] <robertmaxrees> other than just jquery i mean.
[18:34:10] <untitled> spring mvc on the back, thymeleaf on the front
[18:34:34] <untitled> no front-end frameworks
[18:34:37] <robertmaxrees> tymeleaf is backend ;)
[18:34:44] <untitled> ok :)
[18:35:20] <robertmaxrees> https://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/ is one option
[18:36:24] <robertmaxrees> powertip is another option.
[18:39:56] <untitled> robertmaxrees: thanks
[18:40:16] <robertmaxrees> sure.
