[01:07:46] <Junior> i want to help a friend achive something. in order to do that i want to use the jquery columnise plugin. i am havbing problems with it because the html content is added afterwards (after a ajax call). What i have managed to achive is to add a $(window).resize(function(){ and to re-initialise the plugin. The issue is that i don't know how to call the re-initialisation of the plugin after data has been added to the html -> http://pastebin.com/gEtamUpw
[01:16:15] <Junior> don't know why but the has included several version of jquery. if i remove any of them i break things...
[02:35:11] <doug64k> google gives no results on the first page for "grunt sucks" (no quotes). impressive!
[02:38:33] <doug64k> probably because ftp uploading sucks, and minifying, and linting, and compiling all suck, and grunt tries to help
[03:59:23] <michelem> hello folks. I'm sending a nested dictionary as "data" of a .ajax() query. The nested field gets "flattened". What am I getting wrong?
[06:16:21] <ilhami> hey
[06:27:58] <ohcibi_> do browsers js engines have a $ by default nowadays?
[06:29:18] <sacho_> no
[06:31:53] <ohcibi_> then why is it that i open an html page which just an html, a body and a text "hello" and the devtools frome chrome and safari show function $(selector, [startNode]) { [Command Line API] } for $?
[06:45:52] <BinaryKitten> ohcibi_ could be that it's providing something
[06:55:22] <Cork> sacho_: that isn't true actually
[06:55:32] <Cork> most browsers define $ in the dev tools by default now days
[06:55:59] <Cork> where $ == document.getElementById
[06:56:12] <Cork> and $$ (not always defined) is document.querySelector
[07:42:15] <Rogerz> @dutch_kazatel hey
[08:35:30] <rajlaksh> is it possible to access .load() jquery veriable to main page where it reply content?
[08:35:43] <rajlaksh> replace*
[10:59:10] <basiclaser_> hey guys, can i chain selectors in jquery somehow ? I'd like to write something analogous to $('body.div.div.p')
[10:59:24] <systemfault> basiclaser_: What would that do?
[10:59:51] <systemfault> How would you do it in CSS?
[11:00:58] <BillCriswell> <body class="div p"> ?
[11:01:51] <basiclaser_> systemfault: im trying to keep track of certain elements across different websites. so if it's a paragraph tag inside two divs, for example that would be body.div.div.p in the DOM right? so i'd like to be able to select elements based on that DOM path
[11:02:05] <basiclaser_> is there a way to walk down a path in jquery?
[11:02:32] <systemfault> There's always a way... but it can be ugly
[11:02:47] <BillCriswell> basiclaser_: body div div p is what you'd want.
[11:03:56] <systemfault> Ah, thought he wanted something ugly like: "body > div:nth-child(2) > div:nth-child(5) > p"
[11:04:28] <basiclaser_> BillCriswell: thanks bill, but how would implement it? I simply do not know how to write such a thing, if it is at all possible in css/ jquery
[11:04:34] <BillCriswell> Oh.. something xpathish
[11:05:15] <basiclaser_> right yeh, i saw sizzleJS http://sizzlejs.com/ what you recon?
[11:05:33] <basiclaser_> systemfault: thanks. is that actual selector syntax?
[11:05:43] <basiclaser_> i cant rely on classes or ids :(
[11:05:47] <BillCriswell> sizzle is what jquery uses to select elements.
[11:06:06] <systemfault> basiclaser_: It's css, yes.
[11:07:06] <basiclaser_> ah interesting , ill try it out then:)
[11:07:41] <basiclaser_> BillCriswell: oh ok , so it would give me any particular advantage then

[13:08:56] <jlmitch5dev> Hey y'all, I'm having a problem with setting up an event-binding on click.  This does not wait for a click...it just goes ahead and runs the function when uncommented http://pastebin.com/ymjVq2nn
[13:09:33] <jlmitch5dev> I've never set up a binding on an anchor element before, do they have weird rules?
[13:15:07] <jlmitch5dev> ah, you gotta wrap a function call in an anon-function, makes sense when I thought about it more.
[13:17:39] <doug64k> jlmitch5dev: you call it right there
[13:18:03] <doug64k> you call removeEmployee and pass the return value to .on
[13:18:33] <doug64k> what will SeatingPlanEditor.removeEmployee(index) do?
[13:18:33] <jlmitch5dev> Yep doug64k figured it out I wrapped that call in `function() {}`
[13:18:35] <doug64k> it will call it
[13:18:47] <doug64k> k
[13:19:02] <doug64k> you don't gotta though
[13:19:17] <doug64k> but it is the typical way
[13:20:22] <jlmitch5dev> Yeah, I think somehow binding it directly computed the function, and wrapping it didn't
[13:23:14] <doug64k> you don't bind anything, you call it
[13:23:30] <doug64k> if (index) weren't there then sort of
[13:23:45] <doug64k> where does index come from?
[13:24:19] <doug64k> the other way is SeatingPlanEditor.removeEmployee.bind(SeatingPlanEditor, index)

[14:57:21] <frank_o> Anyone know how to copy the HTML generated once clicking on this Selectize dropdown? (http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/)
[14:57:57] <frank_o> Once I move into the console the dropdown will close and its HTML will be reset. I tried forcing element states in Chrome dev tools but that doesn't seem to work.
[15:54:09] <ServerSage> If I have <div class='myDiv'> and I want to do the equivalent of a css .myDiv:before { background: url(test.jpg); } how would I do that in jQuery?
[17:02:25] <zorbsone> Can anyone recommend any good beginner books for learning jQuery?
[17:20:02] <doug64k> ServerSage: $('head').append($('<style/>').text('.myDiv:before { background: url(test.jpg); }'));
[17:20:33] <doug64k> you can .remove it easily if you store the style fragment
[17:21:02] <ServerSage> doug64k: Huh, I was just reading and discovered that pseudo elements are not accessible because they aren't part of the DOM.
[17:21:06] <doug64k> ServerSage: I would be amazed if content selectors can be done in style
[17:21:22] <doug64k> ServerSage: my suggestion works
[17:21:29] <doug64k> I have used it
[17:21:42] <ServerSage> doug64k: Oh, I am giving it a shot.  Just voicing my surprise.
[17:21:54] <doug64k> it makes sense, it isn't really part of the element
[17:22:23] <doug64k> how can you change an element to affect something that isn't part of the element
[17:22:45] <ServerSage> doug64k: Aaah, so if I wanted to have 500 divs with 500 different backgrounds I would have to create a class for each, and append a style for each?
[17:24:13] <doug64k> you got a better way?
[17:24:25] <doug64k> to have 500 different backgrounds
[17:24:40] <ServerSage> No no, just making sure I understand.  :)  Sorry man, not trying to be a dick.  lol
[17:25:09] <doug64k> what you could do, is redefine it into something that doesn't use content selectors
[17:25:33] <doug64k> then you can style each one
[17:25:40] <ServerSage> doug64k: I'm trying to get opacity on the background image.
[17:26:42] <doug64k> ServerSage: that isn't the only way to get opacity. I'm not sure I follow though
[17:27:58] <ServerSage> doug64k: So I want a parent div with a background that has an opacity of .4, and all it's children to have opacity of 1.  Everything I hvae tried so far has given the children the same opacity
[17:30:26] <doug64k> I can fix that I think
[17:30:30] <doug64k> sec
[17:31:38] <ServerSage> You'd be my personal hero!  :P
[17:34:20] <jeffreylevesque> how do i get the MIME type from a temporary url?
[17:35:01] <s00pcan> url of what?  it should match your accepts header
[17:35:06] <doug64k> ServerSage: wow it doesnt work
[17:35:30] <doug64k> ServerSage: do you actually need tons of bg's?
[17:35:42] <doug64k> or was that hypothetical?
[17:35:54] <jeffreylevesque> file upload
[17:36:08] <ServerSage> doug64k: Yeah, it's banner images that need text overlay, and the images need the opacity.
[17:36:27] <ServerSage> doug64k: It's not 500, but it's a lot of them.
[17:38:58] <doug64k> I have a new idea
[17:39:05] <ServerSage> I'm all ears.
[17:39:14] <ServerSage> Or eyes as the case may be.
[17:41:09] <doug64k> ServerSage: http://www.jstraight.com/1165/1
[17:42:33] <doug64k> even if that 2nd piece wasn't inside a div it would be ok
[17:43:00] <ServerSage> Hmmmmm, me likey.
[17:43:03] <doug64k> proof -> http://www.jstraight.com/1165/2
[17:43:38] <doug64k> something later in the dom implicitly is on top of something earlier
[17:43:50] <doug64k> position: absolute elements don't take up space
[17:44:37] <ServerSage> *palm to forehead*  That is brilliant!
[17:44:38] <doug64k> .transbg will prevent problems -> http://www.jstraight.com/1165/3
[17:45:34] <ServerSage> doug64k: Thank you very, VERY much.
[17:45:45] <doug64k> np
[17:47:52] <ServerSage> Seriously, you are my hero, that works PERFECTLY.
[17:47:58] <doug64k> :)
[18:26:17] <Utils> I'm trying to make some sort of ... slider type of thing... where if you click << or >> then it will change the scroll position of a ul element. http://jsfiddle.net/e34abnkd/2/ it change the scrollLeft property of the ul. I've always struggled with scrollLeft but from what I know I'm using it properly...
[18:27:49] <Utils> it doesn't change*
[18:34:13] <Utils> Oh was scrolling left on the wrong element.
[18:38:25] <Utils> http://jsfiddle.net/e34abnkd/3/ there we go. got it with a solution found on stackoverflow to make it more dynamic instead of two separate events.
[19:25:17] <tejas-manohar> why does the insertAfter() work when <button> is within <form></form> but not outside as it is now? https://github.com/tejas-manohar/yominder/blob/master/yominder.html && https://github.com/tejas-manohar/yominder/blob/master/yominder.js
[19:30:22] <shoky> `demo @ tejas-manohar
[19:30:22] <b-ot> tejas-manohar: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[19:32:45] <tejas-manohar> shoky: http://yominder.meteor.com/ how about that? it reflects the code here too btw github.com/tejas-manohar/yominder
[19:34:34] <tejas-manohar> nevermind
[19:34:34] <tejas-manohar> works
[19:34:38] <shoky> tejas-manohar: you're using "button" as the selector, you have another button in the DOM
[19:35:01] <shoky> don't use "button"

[21:19:25] <Unopoo> what's the best book to learn jquery? I'm thinking about learning jquery and jquery in action, but can't decide which to buy
[21:27:06] <zorbsone> so many people and no one talks ;p
[21:31:18] <Unopoo> zorbsone: maybe they are sleeping, so  I heard about
[21:38:25] <toothe> When I update a form element or value, is there a way to view the results in HTML?
[21:41:55] <Kocho> ugh, this is so frustrating.. im trying to install http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/ and it’s basically having no effect on my page: http://adv1wheels.com/registration-submission.php - hover over the “Order Number” field
[21:42:14] <Kocho> it just appears unstyled and i cant work out why it’s not working >:(
[21:47:18] <Kocho> nvm worked it out
[22:39:23] <Unopoo> I have a json array like this:
[22:39:23] <Unopoo> [{"id":"1","title":"title1","content":"content1"},...]
[22:39:23] <Unopoo> now, how can I replace one specific item, like which id=1?
[22:51:53] <hactor> What's the jQueryeze for "remove the style attribute for property and revert back to whatever the .CSS file says"
[22:55:24] <Kartagis> http://www.akbank.com/tr-tr/Sayfalar/default.aspx <--- is the effect when you hover the pictures a result of jquery or css3?
[23:02:10] <hactor> Kartagis, this looks like CSS3 transform even before I look at the code
[23:02:28] <vikky__> hi
[23:02:39] <vikky__> guys i am facing problem in ie 11
[23:02:46] <vikky__> in attr value
[23:03:17] <hactor> vikky__, face it without fear in your heart.
[23:03:51] <vikky__> var btn1 = jQuery(document.activeElement); var btn = btn1.getElementsByName("name");
[23:04:03] <vikky__> alert(btn) returns undefined
[23:04:25] <vikky__> hector: i ie is such a pain
[23:04:46] <vikky__> i am facing this in ie only
[23:05:23] <hactor> vikky__, is <name> a valid element name even?
[23:05:43] <vikky__> yes name ia attribute
[23:05:52] <hactor> vikky__, you're not selecting an attribute
[23:05:58] <hactor> You're selecting tags names <name>
[23:06:07] <vikky__> <input type="submit" value="Save & Continue later" name="save">
[23:06:19] <hactor> vikky__, and I very much doubt this is only in IE11
[23:06:25] <hactor> Your code is bad
[23:06:34] <hactor> Furthermore
[23:06:46] <vikky__> working in firefox and chrome
[23:06:47] <hactor> You create a jQuery object then try to apply DOM method on it.
[23:06:50] <hactor> That's also wrong.
[23:06:59] <hactor> Yeah if it works you have a haunted computer
[23:07:17] <vikky__> what do i need to change
[23:07:22] <vikky__> please suggest
[23:07:45] <hactor> I suggest you actually start thinking about what you're writing. Can you even describe what that code does?
[23:07:58] <hactor> Does jQuery have a method getElementsByName()?
[23:08:39] <vikky__> this cde returns the name of the button that i click , buttons are save, submit
[23:08:41] <hactor> Well let me help you there. It doesn't
[23:08:54] <hactor> How?
[23:09:10] <hactor>  foo = jQuery(something);   foo.methodThatDoesNotExistOnjQuery()
[23:09:12] <hactor> This is your code
[23:10:37] <vikky__> yes u are correct
[23:11:24] <techkudu> you can use an attribute selector like $('button[name="example"]')
[23:11:51] <hactor> techkudu, I have a related question to that btw. How does one escape values for that syntax.
[23:12:02] <hactor> techkudu, I mean, I know how, but do we have a method for it
[23:12:20] <vikky> hi
[23:12:26] <vikky> hector
[23:12:33] <vikky> sorry i was disconnected
[23:12:48] <hactor> vikky__, you got an answer: <techkudu> you can use an attribute selector like $('button[name="example"]')
[23:13:33] <vikky> i need to check which button was clicked
[23:13:42] <vikky> there are two suubmit buttons on the form
[23:14:00] <hactor> vikky, e.currentElement.name
[23:14:12] <hactor> vikky, or $(this).prop('name')
[23:14:18] <hactor> vikky, or $(this).attr('name')
[23:15:01] <vikky> $(this).prop('name') and $(this).attr('name')  doesnt seems to work in IE
[23:15:08] <hactor> bullshit
[23:15:15] <hactor> I feel like you just slap code together without knowing or feeling what it does, and that's not good. You need to know exactly what you're doing when you code
[23:15:46] <vikky> stop telling me that shit
[23:16:03] <sacho_> that shit.
[23:16:10] <hactor> It's the truth. If you don't like it, too bad.
[23:16:54] <sacho_> hactor, it's odd that you'd need to escape input to a selector
[23:17:05] <sacho_> so jquery doesn't have a tool to help you with it
[23:17:17] <hactor> sacho_ values for attribute selectors should be. I have values with quotes for example
[23:17:47] <sacho_> yes, values with quotes are odd. :)
[23:18:13] <Uhkis> ..and invalid html afaik
[23:18:21] <hactor> sacho_ :P it's not that odd. Especially when I take in a value as a variable, ok, maybe usually it won't have quotes in it, but it might
[23:18:37] <hactor> Uhkis, there's nothing invalid in it:    data-foo="hi&quot;there"
[23:18:49] <hactor> Uhkis, this is hi\"there  in CSS-ese
[23:18:59] <hactor> And hi"there as a JS value when read
[23:19:37] <sacho_> it's not odd to have data with quotes. But it's odd to use selectors for it..
[23:19:44] <Uhkis> ugh, awful :-D
[23:20:01] <hactor> sacho_, a bit odd yes, but hey, I didn't invent selectors :P
[23:20:24] <hactor> sacho_, let's say you have a function  getInputValue(name) {}
[23:20:30] <sacho_> hactor, http://jsfiddle.net/kjyd06pm/2/
[23:20:31] <hactor> sacho_, how'd you select that.
[23:20:37] <hactor> sacho_, contrived example, but still
[23:20:54] <sacho_> I wouldn't
[23:21:33] <hactor> sacho_, I'm actually selecting data-* attributes with metadata in a table, but I just don't want to go in detail.
[23:21:44] <hactor> sacho_, I need to select, say, a column that has a given fieldname
[23:21:46] <sacho_> yes, I wouldn't do that at all
[23:22:01] <hactor> sacho_, what would you do.
[23:22:16] <hactor> I mean, it doesn't escape the mind what I could do that's cleaner, but then I wouldn't need jQuery would I :P
[23:22:20] <Gilgameshkun> Question.
[23:22:26] <sacho_> well, I would have collected the metadata into my own objects and used that for search/filtering
[23:22:26] <hactor> I could just JSON encode all the metadata straight in a JS variable
[23:22:27] <Gilgameshkun> $(aJQueryObject, anotherJQueryObject, etcJQueryObject) // does that return a new jQuery object that groups them?
[23:22:35] <hactor> sacho_, right :
[23:22:51] <hactor> sacho_, but again then jQuery would sit lonely and cry all day and who wants that
[23:22:56] <Gilgameshkun> jQuery's API documentation seems a bit ambiguous.
[23:22:59] <Gilgameshkun> On that point.
[23:23:04] <sacho_> hactor, exactly. e.g. dom element with data-attr="attr" becomes { element: dom element, attr: "attr" } and then you can search for "attr" and get the dom elements
[23:23:35] <sacho_> hactor, failing that, I still wouldn't use such specific selectors, I'd use something like $(all_elements).filter(function that checks each one's data)
[23:23:52] <sacho_> the selection engine is nice, but the dom isn't
[23:24:12] <hactor> sacho_, you have a point I'm not gonna lie to myself, and I know this, but *still* it's important to have a way to build selectors programmatically in a safe way I think
[23:24:26] <hactor> sacho_, I like code which is safe as a unit, not just relying on "proper names" and what not
[23:24:44] <hactor> sacho_, say I'm not 100% sure if escaping only quotes there is enough
[23:24:46] <sacho_> hactor, but selectors are already unsafe to build programatically - they're just strings
[23:24:48] <hactor> CSS has a bunch of special chars
[23:24:54] <hactor> sacho_, so is SQL :P
[23:25:02] <sacho_> hactor, what you're looking for is a linq-like solution, which would be awesome but just isn't part of jquery
[23:25:17] <hactor> sacho_, maybe I shall build one :/
[23:25:18] <hactor> Heh
[23:25:19] <sacho_> hactor, that's why noone sane builds sql queries by concatenating strings
[23:25:39] <hactor> sacho_, but yeah thanks for your input, practically you have the right idea, and I don't, when it comes to real implementations
[23:25:49] <Gilgameshkun> I ask my question becaue the documentation seems a bit ambiguous on what's acceptable function input.
[23:26:14] <Gilgameshkun> BTW, I was just spammed in /msg by a user in this channel.
[23:26:20] * hactor adds "escapeCSS" to his library anyway

[23:26:33] <sacho_> hactor, what you're doing makes sense without context. But in the context of the dom being awful and selection engines being tacked on top of it as an (admittedly, very good) bandaid..
[23:26:42] <Gilgameshkun> Thought powers-at-be should know.
[23:26:51] <d3m0n> Does anyone know the technical name for a menu like this I can google for a tutorial? http://tympanus.net/Development/ResponsiveMultiLevelMenu/
[23:27:00] <sacho_> Gilgameshkun, you could try reporting them on #freenode
[23:27:06] <Gilgameshkun> Okay, thanks.
[23:27:26] <bobbobbins> hey, is there any way to detect when a form has stopped loading?
[23:27:31] <Gilgameshkun> #freenode's topic says "Don't comment on spam/trolls."
[23:27:50] <sacho_> hactor, that said, if you have a string with a selector, you could try JSON.stringifying it
[23:28:12] <sacho_> e.g. if you have the string blah"foo"bar, JSON.stringify-ing would escape the quotes
[23:28:29] <hactor> sacho_, I could, but that's like using shell escape in PHP for SQL input :P it's "90% right" and so I'll get surprises 10% of the time
[23:28:42] <sacho_> yup
[23:28:56] <hactor> sacho_, that's why I feel like jQuery should have this, because getting it 100% to spec is not always trivial
[23:29:03] <hactor> So a standard solution would be best
[23:29:16] <sacho_> jquery just assumes you'd select all your dom objects and filter them with filter functions (:
[23:29:26] <hactor> Aight, fair nuff
[23:29:42] <sacho_> I agree, it would be cool to have, otherwise.
[23:29:52] <sacho_> It's just not something people use often, so, it's not made.
[23:31:51] <Gilgameshkun> My question was finally answered, in ##javascript .
[23:34:31] <sacho_> g2k
