[00:00:08] <jphase> well here, it's small, let me just pastebin the entire document to you
[00:00:12] <jphase> oh well
[00:00:16] <jphase> yeah git is better, sec
[00:00:37] <__machine> dblosevn: done... but for both of those (no header or *) the preflight must be failing so browser doesnt submit the actual request
[00:02:02] <mkoks> morning, I am looking for frontend (html and js) for email sender on my site, any suggestions?
[00:02:31] <beancurd> email sender?
[00:02:39] <mkoks> I need something which could validate fields, including email
[00:02:50] <mkoks> and preferably look good out of box
[00:02:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i got something for you after
[00:02:59] <jphase> k
[00:03:08] <beancurd> type="email"
[00:03:19] <beancurd> and patter="<<pattern goes here>>
[00:03:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have this html5/html4 uploader i wrote
[00:03:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> dunno if it still works
[00:03:48] <beancurd> pattern=""
[00:03:59] <mkoks> beancurd isnt that html5?
[00:04:15] <mkoks> I dont want this to be dependant on html5
[00:05:29] <mkoks> but anyway - I thought there is already a template for doing this kind of things
[00:06:00] <mkoks> dont want to write all the html and validations myself
[00:08:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> looks cool
[00:09:38] <Ububegin> Am looking for drop down list and listbox in jquery... Any nice samples.. Have looked around at jqueryUI so far
[00:10:07] <__machine> dblosevn: any other suggestions?
[00:10:53] <jphase> meh, it's kinda basic atm but it's mostly there
[00:11:05] <jphase> does all the extending and strict jQuery plugin writing
[00:11:39] <dblosevn> __machine: i made a working soltuion
[00:11:51] <dblosevn> ignore google telling you its a phising site lol
[00:12:00] <dblosevn> http://isvn.net/
[00:12:21] <dblosevn> i left a scrape result on the landing page of it for too long i guess
[00:12:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: throw this into xampp or what ever you use to run php
[00:12:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://github.com/rohanbhangui/uploaderScript
[00:12:57] <jphase> __machine: if you want another example I had to do this for a client earlier today on a SalesForce page too: https://signaturehospice.secure.force.com/careers
[00:13:06] <Ububegin> I want to be able to select an item from the drop down list (ajax call here) will populate the listbox and select mutliple items from it
[00:13:10] <jphase> don't mind the insecure content, not finished
[00:13:23] <dblosevn> __machine: http://isvn.net posts to 123.isvn.net which redirects to 123.isvn.net/index.php
[00:13:43] <__machine> dblosevn: that is not a preflighted request... it has no extra headers to trigger the preflight request... there is no options request being made...
[00:13:59] <dblosevn> the browser will preflight automatically
[00:14:18] <dblosevn> if I didnt send the headers the request would fail
[00:14:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: just updated my repo
[00:15:08] <__machine> dblosevn: theres no need for preflight for POST request with x-www-form-urlencoded content type... you need to trigger a preflight request by including additional headers or sending a different content type... then the redirect will fail...
[00:15:21] <dblosevn> ok
[00:15:32] <jphase> "rohanbhangui:master and jphase:master are identical."
[00:16:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[00:18:22] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: was just saying I'm all up to date with that repo
[00:18:27] <jphase> must've pulled after you updated
[00:19:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[00:19:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold up
[00:19:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay downlaod now
[00:20:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> there were some useless files i had to get rid off
[00:20:28] <Ububegin> I want to be able to select an item from the drop down list (ajax call here) will populate the listbox and select mutliple items from it
[00:22:50] <__machine> dblosevn: i changed the example to send contentType: "text/css" instead of the default to trigger the preflight... so no extra headers are being sent but the redirect still doesnt get followed
[00:23:09] <dblosevn> im playing with it
[00:24:05] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I can't seem to update my fork :\
[00:24:37] <rabbi1> jphase: this is the max i could get…. kindly help http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/10/
[00:24:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[00:25:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: dunno whats going on
[00:25:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: dowlaoded zip of git a okay
[00:25:55] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: you on windows or mac atm?
[00:26:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> win
[00:26:40] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: sorry, any limelight ?
[00:27:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: jhpase and i are just exchanging soem scripts
[00:27:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: let me take a look
[00:27:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> your ids are the same as values
[00:28:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: whats the issue
[00:28:43] <rabbi1> k
[00:28:45] <jphase> I refuse to proceed without figuring out why my fork isn't seeing any changes...
[00:29:06] <jphase> I can show you what's going on, it's weird
[00:29:14] <jphase> like just says no changes, annoying
[00:29:20] <jphase> I want git in my terminal :`[
[00:29:44] <Ububegin> I want to be able to select an item from the drop down list (ajax call here) will populate the listbox and select mutliple items from it
[00:30:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: dont know whats going on could it be the git eprmissions?
[00:30:12] <Ububegin> btw, can pple see me ... Not sure, whether the NickServ registered me properly
[00:30:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> *permissions
[00:30:22] <jphase> you wanna see?
[00:30:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> Ububegin: read you loud and clear
[00:30:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[00:30:33] <jphase> you might know github better than me, I use a private gitlab server
[00:30:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> how you gonna show me
[00:30:57] <dblosevn> __machine: http://isvn.net
[00:31:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: get the id value from the parent
[00:31:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: wtf?
[00:31:36] <Ububegin> Rohan_Bhangui: roger that..
[00:31:38] <jphase> see what I mean?
[00:31:49] <jphase> idfk, I'll just download it
[00:31:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[00:32:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: try doc and pdf files
[00:32:11] <jphase> I mean, are the files updated??
[00:32:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes they are
[00:32:20] <dblosevn> __machine: never mind :-(
[00:32:41] <jphase> oooo cute icon!
[00:32:43] <jphase> hehe
[00:32:43] <__machine> dblosevn: that is still not a preflighted request... no OPTIONS request shows up in the network tab... no extra headers or unsafe content type is given to trigger preflight :)
[00:32:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks designed my self
[00:32:53] <jphase> ohhh, I see
[00:32:59] <jphase> only specified extensions
[00:33:01] <jphase> in an array or something
[00:33:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> ye
[00:33:24] <jphase> cool
[00:33:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> those are mime tpyes
[00:33:29] <jphase> we should put this in a function wrapper
[00:33:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[00:33:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would love to see how the master does it
[00:33:48] <jphase> hah, I'm no master
[00:33:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> good enough for me
[00:34:00] <Ububegin> I want to be able to select an item from the drop down list (ajax call here) will populate the listbox and select mutliple items from it..
[00:34:02] <jphase> but I'll show you if you wanna private message it
[00:34:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[00:34:05] <jphase> don't wanna annoy peeps
[00:34:20] <Ububegin> Is this the right channel to ask this qn ? pls redirect me if otherwise.. thnaks
[00:34:30] <Ububegin> I want to be able to select an item from the drop down list (ajax call here) will populate the listbox and select mutliple items from it..
[00:34:56] <Ububegin> Looking for jquery samples..
[00:40:15] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: kindly let me know once you are done with jphase
[00:40:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay i can spare a few
[00:41:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase:
[00:41:20] <jphase> sup?
[00:41:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> he needs to take the parent name
[00:41:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> of select clicked
[00:41:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> like add id to parent
[00:41:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> the <select>
[00:41:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> and when option selected
[00:41:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> get the parents id
[00:41:52] <jphase> hmm, don't get that last part
[00:42:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> well right now error is that the id and the value are the same
[00:42:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> play with the fiddle
[00:42:26] <jphase> like, the option clicked gets the parent id except when it's selected or visa versa?
[00:42:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> check the fiddle
[00:42:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> play with it
[00:42:45] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: jphase http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/15/
[00:42:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> try the preview -_-
[00:43:01] <rabbi1> just display the selected items….
[00:43:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: wait what
[00:43:20] <rabbi1> with the id …
[00:43:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> arent your ids the same as values?
[00:43:34] <rabbi1> yeah, it has to be. ..
[00:43:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> eg : id:2--2 id:13--13
[00:44:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: see the o.value
[00:44:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> there are duplicates
[00:44:22] <jphase> yeah
[00:44:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> what im saying
[00:44:29] <jphase> it needs to be the id of what?
[00:44:36] <jphase> the parent select?
[00:44:43] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: yeap, it is …. display the selected items, and with the same id for the element… if an item is unselected, remove only that item and not others,  also storing those selected items in an array ...
[00:44:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay give the <select> ids
[00:44:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> numbered
[00:44:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 to n
[00:45:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then when the push button is pressed
[00:45:18] <rabbi1> no, what the use of id in select ?
[00:45:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> retrieve the options parent's id
[00:45:42] * jphase is confused what the goal is
[00:45:49] <jphase> so you want to push selected values onto an array?
[00:45:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/15/#&togetherjs=xFPftsyAP2
[00:45:57] <jphase> and pop them off when done?
[00:46:06] <jphase> done meaning unselected?
[00:46:12] <rabbi1> jphase: duplicates ?
[00:48:47] <__machine> dblosevn: still going? i dont see how we could make this ajax request any simpler and it should work... so it seems like both chrome and firefox are buggy, or maybe they interpreted the spec as to now allow redirects for preflighted cors requests?
[00:50:11] <dblosevn> __machine: yep still going
[01:04:43] <jphase> rabbi1: Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/10/#&togetherjs=GzfjQ60tHH
[01:07:08] <Ububegin> what's the difference between jquery.js and jquery.min.js ...
[01:07:19] <Cork> min is minified
[01:07:26] <dblosevn> __machine: well i tried, think its bedtime lol
[01:08:03] <dblosevn> sup cork long time :-)
[01:08:05] <__machine> dblosevn: so im not doing anything wrong, its a browser or spec issue? :)
[01:08:23] <Cork> dblosevn: lots to do, except for that just fine
[01:08:44] <dblosevn> __machine: appears right i am kinda tired though
[01:09:36] <__machine> Cork: did you look into preflighted cors requests following redirects? i have a simple code example to demonstrate... http://test.office.3030.com.au:1704/test/ ... the preflighted request wont follow redirect but the simple request will... you mentioned yesterday that this does or should work?
[01:10:01] <dblosevn> Cork might know, hes having problems preflighting CORS requests, looking at his headers looks like he did everything right the browsers just seem to not have caught up with the spec yet
[01:10:02] <Cork> __machine: sadly no, it got stuck with other things i had to take care of...
[01:10:11] <Ububegin> Cork: minified as in for mobile phones
[01:10:20] <Cork> dblosevn: i know we have talked about it before
[01:10:32] <Cork> ?g minifying javascript
[01:10:32] <b-ot> Cork: Minify Javascript Online / Online JavaScript Packer → http://jscompress.com/
[01:11:01] <Cork> Ububegin: no as in reduced library size
[01:11:16] <jop008> I have this code but it is coming twice
[01:11:19] <jop008> <body> <script> if ($.mobile.gradeA() ) {   alert ("grade A");
[01:11:32] <jop008> so 2 alerts in stead of 1
[01:11:53] <Ububegin> Cork: but functionality is the same.. only white and comments are removed
[01:11:55] <Cork> jop008: that wouldn't be possible unless you load it through ajax or something
[01:12:25] <Cork> Ububegin: white space removed, comments, linebreaks, variable names shortened, function names shortened yes
[01:13:07] <Ububegin> Cork: roger that bro
[01:14:49] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[01:15:29] <jop008> Even onthe console it is getting twice Cork
[01:15:50] <Cork> jop008: too little context
[01:16:06] <Cork> jop008: basically try reproduce it in jsfiddle.net
[01:17:03] <jop008> this is the complete code http://pastebin.com/kFimbQTJ
[01:26:21] <Cork> ah, jqm
[01:26:46] <Cork> jop008: well unless a script is fiddling with the content in body that can't run twice
[01:29:33] <jop008> Someone a good browser detection example?
[01:29:55] <Cork> jop008: most of the time if you need browser detection your doing it wrong
[01:30:05] <Cork> you SHOULD use feature detection instead
[01:30:17] <jop008> no I need it to see if date is treated nice on jqM
[01:30:29] <Cork> exactly
[01:30:46] <jop008> safari end FF don't show a date pcker
[01:30:54] <Cork> so test that instead of the browser ua
[01:30:56] <jop008> ont hte desktop
[01:31:43] <jop008> dude of course I was trying to do this but beyond my reach so => browser detection
[01:31:54] <jop008> How can I test for date handling?
[01:32:28] <dblosevn> oh Cork, finally got around to making thoughs 360s with canvas, now there beautimus and responsive http://assets.catkiosk.com/global/360/html5/ipad_AP1000E_en.html
[01:33:15] <Cork> jop008: $.support.inputTypeDate = (function() { var elm = document.createElement('input'); elm.type = 'date'; return elm.type === 'date'; })()
[01:34:44] <Cork> dblosevn: nice
[01:35:00] <dblosevn> even made it a plugin lol
[01:36:38] <jop008> Thanks works great FF and Safari desktop show falls
[01:37:42] <jop008> Now I want if false insert widget code otherwise a normal <input best way to do this?
[01:37:49] <Cork> jop008: so as you see feature detection isn't hard, as long as you drop the ua sniffing line of thought
[01:37:56] <Cork> jop008: yes
[01:38:58] <jop008> as long as you know this line return elm.type === 'date';
[01:39:03] <jop008> then it is simple
[01:40:22] <Cork> jop008: well date is the native input type for the date picker
[01:40:32] <Cork> and if the browser doesn't support the date picker
[01:40:36] <Cork> they convert '
[01:40:43] <rabbi1> how can i push/ pop only the selected items http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/15/
[01:40:44] <Cork> 'date' to 'text'
[01:40:59] <rabbi1> Cork: ^ any help is appreciated ...
[01:41:10] <jop008> I was thinking of this solution <div class=date class=:id_:></div> and then a function that creates the html for the input field
[01:41:17] <Cork> ?api jquery.grep
[01:41:17] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.grep(): Finds the elements of an array which satisfy a filter function. The original array is not affected. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.grep/
[01:42:23] <rabbi1> no, it should be removed ….
[01:42:45] <rabbi1> i just want to keep the selected in array and append an element with unique ids
[01:43:39] <Cork> and the id's is the value?
[01:43:58] <rabbi1> yeah
[01:44:22] <Cork> $.map($('option:selected'), function(elm) { return elm.value; });
[01:44:52] <Cork> that would give you an array of the id's
[01:45:18] <rabbi1> also i need the text….
[01:45:26] <rabbi1> elm.text
[01:45:32] <Cork> where?
[01:45:40] <Cork> two dimentional array?
[01:46:02] <rabbi1> i need to display the list of selected options and a unique id added to each element
[01:46:03] <Cork> $.map($('option:selected'), function(elm) { return [elm.value, $(elm).text()]; });
[01:46:19] <Cork> rabbi1: i don't follow where the problem is so...
[01:46:26] <rabbi1> o thanks Cork: will give it a try
[01:54:24] <rabbi1> Cork: its confusing, i guess if you could have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/15/ once
[01:55:58] <jop008> if I have this <div data-type="date" data-id="birth_date"></div> how can I loop over divs with date-type= date?
[01:56:15] <Cork> rabbi1: 1. the map you call there isn't needed, it won't make any changes to what you get anyway
[01:56:30] <Cork> rabbi1: what what is the problem?
[01:56:49] <Cork> jop008: best is to give it a class
[01:57:11] <Cork> alternatively you can do $('[data-type="date"]')
[01:57:29] <Cork> though that forces the browser to actually traverse the dom tree
[01:57:40] <jop008> and then Ican use each constuct?
[01:57:41] <rabbi1> Cork: i need to append the value of each selected item
[01:57:58] <Asmoooh> guys! what happened to the blue and yellow theme in the latest jqm?
[01:58:04] <Asmoooh> i only have white and black
[01:58:24] <poacher2k> hey! I've run into a small hitch with .data() that for me does not make any sense at all
[01:58:25] <poacher2k> http://jsfiddle.net/xRenq/
[01:58:32] <dyu> is there a good plugin where i can move an image underneath a circle? going to use it to realign profile pics. sort of like the opposite of this: http://odyniec.net/projects/imgareaselect/ the circle is stationary, but the image moves underneath it while i drag it(the image) around
[01:59:19] <poacher2k> does anyone know why the .data() doesn't set a data-attribute, while .attr() does?
[01:59:20] <odyniec> oh, my plugin got mentioned
[01:59:36] <rabbi1> Cork: its just append and display the list of options selected , that's the ultimate goal ( but it also includes removing unselected items and listing with out removing the existing list except the unselected ones' )
[02:02:41] <dyu> odyniec: good job
[02:02:53] <Cork> rabbi1: so basically http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/17/ ?
[02:03:06] <odyniec> dyu: thanks!
[02:03:13] <Cork> actually let me rewrite that
[02:03:31] <Cork> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/18/
[02:03:40] <Cork> ...
[02:03:44] <Cork> missed one part >_<
[02:03:48] <rabbi1> Cork: checking
[02:03:50] <rabbi1> … o ok
[02:04:05] <Cork> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/19/
[02:04:17] <Cork> there THAT should do what it looks like your trying to do
[02:04:35] <rabbi1> nothing is being added at all
[02:05:21] <odyniec> dyu: As for your question, I don't know if there's an existing plugin, but I think it should be fairly straightforward to build, I would try using a semi-transparent PNG file as a mask
[02:05:32] <rabbi1> Cork: nothings working ….
[02:05:41] <Cork> rabbi1: ya, there is a variable missing
[02:05:47] <Cork> and... can't find it right now XD
[02:05:54] <Cork> ah, there
[02:06:10] <Cork> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/20/
[02:07:40] <rabbi1> Cork: great !! how did you do it ??
[02:08:03] <Cork> rabbi1: you overcomplicated the problem quite a bit
[02:08:06] <rabbi1> Cork: o you removing the <li>
[02:08:07] <rabbi1> ?
[02:08:16] <Cork> yes
[02:08:22] <rabbi1> sorry, i don want to be repopulated ...
[02:08:25] <rabbi1> o o
[02:08:26] <Cork> and then i just did a map on the list of elements
[02:08:38] <Cork> rabbi1: why not?
[02:08:49] <rabbi1> this was the reason i had an array and was comparing with inArray()
[02:09:02] <Cork> rabbi1: but why?
[02:09:19] <Cork> it is more costly to do it that way then just adding it from scratch
[02:09:30] <rabbi1> the element appended is not just <li> It's a jquery slider, and i need to retain the value of the slider
[02:09:37] <Cork> of you really care about the performance build a string instead of appending inline
[02:09:53] <Cork> so check if the id exist
[02:10:11] <Cork> and if it doesn't remove it
[02:10:22] <rabbi1> o yeah, id is always unique …
[02:10:30] <Cork> yes
[02:10:35] <rabbi1> o missed that part after horifiying sessions
[02:10:37] <Cork> or rather the dom can only reference one id
[02:11:46] <rabbi1> Cork: thanks
[02:11:54] <rabbi1> hope all will be okay now :)
[02:12:18] <poacher2k> is there any performance or compatability differences in using .data() and .attr('data', '...') ?
[02:12:50] <poacher2k> as .attr('data', '...') seems to be working more reliably
[02:13:01] <Cork> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/22/
[02:13:03] <poacher2k> then again, .data() is made for exactaly that
[02:13:33] <poacher2k> exactly*
[02:13:47] <Cork> poacher2k: data doesn't touch the dom element so it doesn't waydown the dom
[02:13:54] <Cork> poacher2k: also it isn't limitated to strings
[02:14:06] <Cork> attr is just working with the attribute directly
[02:14:07] <dyu> odyniec: what concepts should i know? masking? (i'm new at this. please don't eat me.)
[02:14:31] <poacher2k> I see, that's pretty handy, but how about reliability ?
[02:14:39] <Cork> poacher2k: so basically, if you need to use dom selectors based on the data value use attr, else use data
[02:14:39] <poacher2k> check this out, for example: http://jsfiddle.net/xRenq/
[02:15:06] <Cork> poacher2k: .data is if anything more reliable, cause you can store references to dom elements, objects, functions and so on
[02:15:18] <odyniec> dyu: by "masking" I simply mean putting a semi-transparent PNG image (with a circle-shaped "hole" in the middle) over the actual image that is supposed to be dragged, that's all
[02:15:37] <Cork> the only thing you lose with attr is the possibility to use selectors on the value
[02:15:50] <Cork> (and that it is lost if you serialize the dom to html)
[02:16:27] <Cork> poacher2k: $(document.createElement('a')) can just be written $('<a>')
[02:16:39] <Cork> same with the li
[02:16:50] <poacher2k> ooh.
[02:17:05] <poacher2k> so var a = $('<a>') ?
[02:17:37] <Cork> poacher2k: http://jsfiddle.net/xRenq/1/
[02:17:51] <poacher2k> cool.
[02:18:14] <Cork> btw you're generating invalid structure
[02:18:24] <Cork> li's has to be a child of an ul or ol
[02:18:42] <poacher2k> true
[02:18:44] <poacher2k> oh
[02:18:46] <poacher2k> hm
[02:18:55] <poacher2k> I see
[02:19:14] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/xRenq/2/
[02:20:32] <anew> any way to asynchronously load jq from google cdn ?
[02:21:15] <Cork> anew: sure, as long as you don't depend on .ready
[02:21:38] <Cork> just add jquery at the end of the body document
[02:21:42] <anew> i cant figure out how, i use <script src="" async></script>
[02:21:45] <anew> but apparantly that doesnt work
[02:21:49] <anew> (it works for my local scripts)
[02:23:22] <Cork> anew: if you load it from a cdn branded server or not doesn't matter
[02:23:48] <anew> hmm weird, when i use the async attribute, it cannot find jquery
[02:23:54] <anew> if i remove it, everything works properly
[02:24:06] <diverdude> Hi, Would it be possible to use html5 file controller to build a filestructure on the client machine? Regardless if its windows, mac or linux ?
[02:24:12] <Cork> well when are you trying to access it?
[02:24:21] <anew> above my local script
[02:24:28] <Cork> well there you go
[02:24:33] <anew> ?
[02:24:38] <Cork> as it is async you script will run before it
[02:24:43] <anew> hmmm
[02:24:55] <anew> but if my script is below the jq cdn...
[02:25:07] <Cork> try adding document.addEventListener('onload', function() {}); around your code
[02:25:15] <Cork> anew: async
[02:25:18] <Cork> remember? :D
[02:25:27] <Cork> below doesn't matter in async
[02:25:35] <anew> hmm yeah is there anything i can do ... to have them load async and one wait for the other ?
[02:25:42] <anew> will try that onload
[02:26:16] <Cork> anew: you might have to use an event trigger on the script tag
[02:26:22] <Cork> to catch when the content has been loaded
[02:26:36] <Cork> but i think onload for the document should work
[02:26:54] <anew> let me try...so i remove document.ready() and replace with what u wrote ?
[02:27:00] <Cork> ya
[02:27:13] <Cork> you can't use ready unless you know jquery has been loaded
[02:27:21] <Asmoooh> why does jquery remove things from newer versions so they fuckup my website
[02:27:21] <Cork> and it has to have been loaded in head for that to work
[02:27:37] <Cork> Asmoooh: well they removed a few broken apis
[02:27:49] <Cork> Asmoooh: but the apis has been depricated for ages
[02:27:54] <Asmoooh> whats wrong with erxample: .live?
[02:27:58] <anew> it's not $(document).addEventListener('onload', function(){});
[02:28:13] <Cork> anew: you don't have jquery so no $()
[02:28:21] <Cork> and addEventListener
[02:28:28] <Cork> + isn't a function on jquery
[02:28:45] <Cork> Asmoooh: $() in the live syntax searches the dom for the matching element
[02:29:04] <Cork> Asmoooh: then .live throws away the list of matched elements and uses jquerys .selector string
[02:29:10] <Cork> that is a waist of resources
[02:29:12] <Asmoooh> hm
[02:29:29] <Cork> Asmoooh: additionally .live doesn't work with the chaining you do in jquery
[02:29:36] <Cork> so you have a broken expectation too
[02:29:41] <Asmoooh> $(".ui-dialog button").live("click", function() {  ?
[02:29:49] <Cork> for example ya
[02:29:52] <Asmoooh> how should i replace that one than
[02:30:01] <anew> no didnt work
[02:30:03] <anew> still cant find jq
[02:30:07] <Cork> $(document).on("click", ".ui-dialog button", function() {
[02:30:11] <Asmoooh> hm
[02:30:13] <Cork> that does the EXACT same thing as live
[02:30:18] <Cork> except with a sain syntax
[02:30:40] <Asmoooh> let me try if it really works
[02:30:48] <anew> i guess i could ... include the minified jq in my script
[02:30:49] <anew> meh
[02:30:55] <Cork> anew: so onload fires before the script has been loaded
[02:30:57] <anew> so then it will definitely load it first
[02:31:04] <Cork> anew: no
[02:31:12] <Asmoooh> doesnt seem to give an error (yet)
[02:31:13] <anew> no?
[02:31:13] <Asmoooh> :P
[02:31:15] <Cork> anew: why do you need to load jquery async?
[02:31:27] <anew> because google complains
[02:31:32] <anew> about me not loading it async
[02:31:39] <anew> and ther eis no way to do it pretty much
[02:31:41] <Cork> anew: you should not bundle jquery
[02:31:49] <Cork> O_o
[02:31:55] <anew> google is so fkn stupid
[02:31:59] <Cork> ya
[02:32:03] <Asmoooh> Cork, i noticed when i upgrade my jq and jqm my site doesnt work as it should, themes are gone now, my left slide menu doesnt work anymore
[02:32:15] <anew> what was that inline idea you had?
[02:32:26] <Cork> Asmoooh: so you need to update what needs to be updated
[02:32:45] <anew> can i inline if (jq is loaded){ load my script};
[02:32:48] <Asmoooh> the problem is, i dont use anything myself.. its only jqm that does that
[02:32:59] <Asmoooh> or isnt 1.4 jqm compatible with 2.x jq?
[02:33:35] <Cork> anew: var jq = document.createElement('script'); jq.src = 'url-to-jquery'; jq.onload = function() { /*your code */ }; document.head.appendChild(jq);
[02:33:48] <Asmoooh> but themes gone i cant do anything about.. when i use old jqm css file it does strange things :)
[02:33:50] <anew> yeah
[02:33:50] <Cork> anew: though this IS silly and i would not do it my self
[02:33:53] <anew> let me try that
[02:33:55] <anew> well
[02:33:58] <anew> it's very silly
[02:34:02] <anew> i think it's absolutely retarded
[02:34:08] <anew> but i need to get this score higher
[02:34:10] <Cork> Asmoooh: read the requirements on the site
[02:34:35] <Cork> anew: well what you should do is have jquery (only jquery) in the head
[02:34:41] <Cork> and everything else at the end of body
[02:34:42] <Asmoooh> oohh there
[02:34:48] <Asmoooh> i see i tought it was an example
[02:34:49] <Asmoooh> :)
[02:34:51] <anew> i have issues with that as well
[02:34:55] <anew> lol
[02:34:58] <anew> i have issues with everything
[02:35:00] <anew> let me try ur code
[02:35:24] <Cork> (me cries a bit from the through of anyone actually doing something like that...)
[02:35:36] <Cork> though is is basically what bootstrap does...
[02:35:59] <anew> oh i'm crying
[02:36:04] <anew> believe me i'm crying
[02:37:04] <anew> fml
[02:39:27] <Asmoooh> Cork, oh i see that jqm does work, only thing is that the yellow and blue theme are gone and i needed them
[02:59:58] <dwarder> is there a way i can substitute .parent().parent().parent().parent()   ?
[03:00:07] <dwarder> to something shorter
[03:01:18] <xec> dwarder: if your great great grandparent is a unique element, you can do .closest("selector")
[03:02:05] <xec> or, you can make a .greatGreatGrandparent() plugin!
[03:02:44] <Cork> <_<'
[03:02:55] <dwarder> xec: or stay with my 'parent()'s
[03:02:58] <dwarder> :)
[03:03:03] <Cork> xec: cute
[03:03:43] <xec> my vote is for the .greatGreatGrandparent() plugin of course. simple. succinct.
[03:04:00] <Cork> >_<'
[03:05:19] <xec> $.fn.greatGreatGrandparent = function() { return this.map(function(){ return $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent(); }); };
[03:05:24] <xec> something like that
[03:05:36] <Cork> <_<'
[03:05:39] <Cork> map??
[03:06:01] * Cork starts to feel like he's reading a horror story... >_>
[03:06:06] <xec> yes? shouldn't that work?
[03:06:12] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[03:06:23] <dwarder> xec: with closest when i found my selector and i want to go deeper that tree what other thing should i use/
[03:06:25] <Cork> don't see why you would need it at all
[03:06:26] <dwarder> ?
[03:06:42] <Cork> dwarder: deeper is .find
[03:06:50] <dwarder> childrem?
[03:06:50] <Cork> upwards is .closest
[03:06:54] <Cork> .find
[03:06:56] <dwarder> children*
[03:06:57] <dwarder> ok
[03:06:58] <Cork> .find
[03:06:59] <Cork> >_<
[03:07:06] <dwarder> <_>'
[03:07:15] <dwarder> ;)
[03:07:18] <xec> Cork: well, .parent() does "Get the parent of each element" so i'd want greatGreatGrandparent() to behave similarly
[03:08:11] <Cork> xec: $.fn.greatGreatGrandparent = function() { return this.parent().parent().parent().parent(); };
[03:08:16] <Cork> xec: the map isn't needed
[03:08:38] <xec> you're right of course
[03:09:04] <xec> still a horrible idea though :D
[03:09:09] <Cork> ya!
[03:09:30] <dwarder> you can pass a param to your greatGreatGrandparent
[03:09:35] <Cork> xec: why not make a .getRelatives function instead?
[03:09:38] <dwarder> which is a number
[03:09:41] <xec> lol
[03:09:50] <dwarder> or parents
[03:09:52] <dwarder> haha
[03:10:00] <Cork> xec: and you give it a string like 'grand parent second sibling' :)
[03:10:01] <xec> dwarder: that already exists
[03:10:15] <dwarder> xec: how is it called?
[03:10:25] <xec> dwarder. uh.. .parents()
[03:10:28] <Cork> dwarder: parents is similar to closest
[03:10:32] <dwarder> ohh
[03:10:35] <Cork> except it gives all matching parents
[03:10:41] <Cork> not just the closest matching one
[03:12:50] <jop008> is it possible to replace a parent node?
[03:13:12] <Cork> jop008: replace a parent or change parent of the current element?
[03:13:33] <Cork> (both is possible, what you do differ quite a bit though)
[03:13:52] <jop008> change the parent node it self it must become <div><label/>etc.
[03:14:16] <xec> you could .wrap() something?
[03:14:25] <jop008> elem.parent.html( chtml) like this?
[03:14:25] <Cork> jop008: you need to insert a new dom element close to the current element
[03:14:41] <Cork> then do newparent.html(oldparent.children())
[03:14:44] <Cork> and oldparent.remove()
[03:15:12] <Cork> though that only works if you don't have textnodes in the old parent element
[03:15:24] <jop008> and how is newparent defined?
[03:15:53] <Cork> var newparent = $('<div>'); $(oldparent).after(newparent);
[03:17:08] <jop008> okay thx
[03:17:35] <Cork> jop008: note though that this will lose event listeners on the old parent if there was any
[03:17:58] <jop008> that is obvious but there are no events
[03:18:07] <jop008> attached
[03:21:31] <anew> cork http://pastebin.com/0CNWPbmq
[03:21:54] <anew> instead of waiting for the window to load to load the <script>
[03:22:06] <anew> how can i start loading it after the above cdn has finished loading ?
[03:24:17] <jop008> So I have this <div date place holder> if i put my html here it is rendered a bit fifferent </div> So I want to inert my html on the <div date place holder level
[03:24:47] <jop008> the div itself has no formatting but it is different in rendering
[03:27:27] <doug65536> jop008:  to change the parent, and preserve event handlers (that are directly on that element), you can use .detach and insert that somewhere else
[03:32:35] <jop008> why there is no space available between label and the input field?
[03:32:47] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/Fceq7/3/
[03:35:43] <anew> is it terrible to load jq from our own server instead of a cdn ?
[03:37:38] <doug65536> anew: not at all
[03:37:51] <anew> how bad is it
[03:37:57] <anew> just be honest with me
[03:37:59] <anew> dont sugar coat it
[03:38:25] <doug65536> anew: maybe 1/10th of a second slower page load, only the first time they visit your site. then instant from there on
[03:38:36] <anew> 100ms
[03:38:38] <anew> hmmm
[03:38:45] <anew> and from google cdn what kind of page load are we getting
[03:38:48] <doug65536> you would need to test it for your host
[03:38:53] <doug65536> google isn't faster
[03:39:03] <doug65536> they use the cdn bs to snoop on what sites you visit
[03:39:04] <anew> it's just that they will have it cached
[03:39:11] <anew> o rly
[03:39:13] <anew> snoop?
[03:39:19] <doug65536> they don't host it out of the goodness of their heart
[03:39:55] <doug65536> yes, when a users browser gets it, your browser tells them what site it is. they also know your address. so they can snoop on what kind of sites you visit
[03:40:01] <anew> heh
[03:40:12] <doug65536> they don't enable good caching or anything
[03:40:15] <anew> nothing is private
[03:40:19] <doug65536> they WANT your browser to check every time
[03:40:43] <anew> if i ever see sergey brin i'm kicking him in the nuts
[03:40:58] <doug65536> it could even be slower. on your own site, the browser can reuse the connection. if using a cdn, it has to open a new connection to google server
[03:41:57] <anew> yeah true, at least i save a connection right
[03:42:11] <doug65536> if their purpose was honorable, they would enable an expiry date in the response and it would definitely be faster. but since google's intent is actually more malicious than anything, it isn't much faster, if at all, and could be slower
[03:42:51] <anew> damn, just tried it... definitely slower loading it from my site than theirs
[03:43:01] <anew> not sure why, it just makes my js file hue
[03:43:02] <anew> huge
[03:44:35] <doug65536> anew: you should put it in a subdirectory, and add an htaccess that enables very aggressive caching
[03:44:47] <doug65536> on my site, jquery is 0ms - it doesn't even check with the server
[03:45:47] <anew> wtf
[03:45:47] <doug65536> anew: I don't believe you. you must be testing using refresh. don't refresh, it kills caching completely
[03:45:48] <anew> 0ms
[03:45:56] <anew> how else am i supposed to test?
[03:45:59] <anew> i need to test new users
[03:46:05] <anew> not usres that have been here before
[03:46:15] <doug65536> yeah right...
[03:46:29] <anew> yeah right?
[03:46:29] <doug65536> "I'm leaving this site, it took 0.6 seconds for it to load"
[03:46:47] <anew> why would i test page speeds for returning users that have the entire site cached images, js etc
[03:46:52] <anew> that makes no sense
[03:47:58] <doug65536> anew: you can have a 1-time improvement that is so small that you can't even tell... or, if you host your own and really cache it, you can have a permanent infinite improvement
[03:48:40] <doug65536> who cares about a split second for 1-time visitors
[03:48:43] <anew> every 'small' thing adds up to one  big thing
[03:48:51] <anew> so shaving time off every little thing can add up to 400ms
[03:49:10] <doug65536> whatever. you are already convinced. use your cdn. I hope your users appreciate that you are helping google track them
[03:49:25] <anew> trust me i dont want to use it
[03:49:30] <anew> i hate google
[03:49:52] <anew> i wasnt even using their analytics until the other one i was using couldnt track the amount of visitors i was getting
[03:49:53] <T13|needsCoffee> Anen
[03:50:40] <doug65536> and what value does the analytics provide you anyway? a warm feeling inside that people are viewing it?
[03:50:59] <anew> wat lol no... do you have 500k visits a month lol
[03:51:02] <anew> u kind of need analytics
[03:51:12] <anew> u must only make money programming
[03:51:12] <doug65536> for what
[03:51:26] <anew> oh i dont know how about to earn a living lol
[03:51:28] <dwarder> i have $(this) in my event, what is the right way to pass it to a function so that i could use int like $(this).parent() in the function?
[03:51:38] <dwarder> int = it
[03:51:46] <doug65536> anew: keep drinking that google kool aid
[03:51:56] <Cork> dwarder: just pass it as a variable to the function
[03:52:00] <Cork> func($(this))
[03:52:09] <anew> lmao
[03:52:18] <anew> doug65536, talk to me when u earn an income online that's not from programming
[03:52:23] <dwarder> Cork: and i could use it as $(this) from within the func right?
[03:52:24] <usc911> Hey guys, just wondering how I go about targeting the '$('.alive_input').val($('.alive_input').val()+'|');' and giving it a class? as I want to get the pipe blinking, any help would be appreciated https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/6776733
[03:52:26] <anew> until then ur out of ur territory
[03:52:41] <Cork> dwarder: yes, just use the other variable name for it
[03:52:58] <Cork> like function func(elm) { elm.parent() }
[03:53:08] <dwarder> ohh i see cool
[03:53:10] <dwarder> thanks
[03:53:23] <Cork> dwarder: $() is just a function call
[03:53:38] <fat_> I got a simple javascript that does a php function:  alert("<?PHP $var + 1 ?>");        However, how do i do the php function without the user knowing, eg the user will know that the script has executed a function because it alerts them.
[03:53:39] <anew> is there any way to test if jq is already cached on a users browser ?
[03:53:41] <Cork> dwarder: and this in the event handler is a variable pointing to the element the event happened on
[03:54:08] <Cork> fat_: you can't run php client side
[03:54:29] <Cork> fat_: you can run php server side, and save the output in a javascript variable or similar
[03:54:45] <Cork> fat_: though that would only happen when the page loads
[03:54:53] <Cork> not when the function in js runs
[03:54:56] <fat_> Cork: http://psoug.org/snippet/Call-a-PHP-function-when-clicking-on-an-HTML-button_914.htm im using this tutorial
[03:55:15] <Cork> fat_: no, that doesn't work
[03:55:22] <fat_> Cork: it is working
[03:55:44] <Cork> fat_: well yes, cause "<?PHP hello(); ?>" runs when php renders the page
[03:56:09] <Cork> and saves "something from global $a" in a string in js
[03:56:12] <fat_> Cork: yes. However, it alerts the user when it runs the php function. How do i make it run in the background
[03:56:21] <Cork> when js runs it outputs the statis string from js
[03:56:37] <Cork> fat_: no it outputs the static result from the function
[03:56:49] <Cork> what js has is the statis output from the php function, not the function
[03:57:13] <Cork> fat_: if you want prof, do $num++ in the function
[03:57:19] <Cork> fat_: and run the function twice
[03:57:29] <Cork> (echoHello that is)
[03:57:54] <Cork> fat_: the reason for this is that php runs server side, not client side
[03:58:01] <Cork> fat_: so you can't call it from js
[03:59:26] <fat_> Cork: i understand. but i know it outputs the static result from js, but i want to replace alert() with something that the user won't know happens
[03:59:35] <fat_> Cork: document.write is making the page load endlessly
[03:59:44] <Cork> fat_: so don't echo anything to js
[04:00:02] <fat_> Cork: then it'll give an alert message with nothing in it anyway\
[04:00:13] <Cork> remote the js part and just do <?php run_secred_command(); ?>
[04:00:23] <Cork> fat_: i meant remove ALL the js
[04:00:41] <Cork> echoHello isn't needed at all
[04:00:59] <fat_> Cork: but then my link won't work to run the php function
[04:01:08] <Cork> fat_: why?
[04:01:10] <Cork> it's just a string
[04:01:20] <Cork> js can't run php
[04:01:23] <fat_> Cork: can you please put it in an example
[04:01:40] <Cork> or do you mean you want to generate js from php?
[04:02:25] <fat_> Cork: i want a script that if u click on a button, it'll do a php function. thats all
[04:04:08] <Cork> you can't
[04:04:16] <Cork> you need to do an ajax call for that to work
[04:04:24] <Cork> js has to contact the server for the php to run
[04:33:46] <Richhh> (how) can i capture key presses in an input and switch focus to another input box if they are not any of ['0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','.']? (i want to automatically change to the correct input box if a user tries to type letters into a number field)
[04:41:15] <xec> Richhh: you can listen to the "input" event and check the e.keyCode iirc
[04:50:11] <fat_> Cork: other than alert or document.write, are there any more ways of displaying data
[04:50:39] <Cork> fat_: none of those should be used in the first case
[04:50:48] <Cork> yes you can you can append it to an element in the page
[04:50:49] <fat_> Cork: why not
[04:51:06] <Cork> fat_: cause it is legacy calls used in the early 90's
[04:51:27] <Cork> there standards has build better ways to manage the page, like the dom :)
[04:51:38] <fat_> Cork: document.querySelector('div.x').id = 'y';    ?
[04:51:47] <fat_> Cork: append it like that?
[04:52:07] <Cork> fat_: well you are in the jquery channel so $('.x').text('y')
[04:52:29] <Cork> ?g learn jquery
[04:52:30] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/
[04:52:32] <Cork> fat_: ^
[04:52:43] <jop008> I have this  $( "#" + cid ).val ( cvalue ); but the date field is not updated with the new cvalue
[04:52:53] <jop008> must I do a refresh?
[04:57:01] <fat_> Cork: this is my code http://pastebin.com/5ewz54kh i dont understand why it doesn't work
[04:57:19] <Richhh> fat_ all you need to do is select an HTML element to have it html content replaced
[04:57:38] <Cork> fat_: what is "results" ?
[04:58:07] <Cork> fat_: looks like you need to learn the basics
[04:58:49] <fat_> Cork: well, if i do alert(results) it shows "Hey, what did you type text for?" where "text" is what you typed in the search box
[04:59:12] <Richhh> why is there 'for?' at the end?
[04:59:35] <Cork> fat_: so you want to add that text to the element with id y?
[04:59:44] <fat_> Cork: here, this pastebin shows all of my html http://pastebin.com/r5rPuNvr
[04:59:49] <fat_> cork: yes
[04:59:55] <Cork> $('#y').text(results)
[05:00:30] <Richhh> ^
[05:00:32] <fat_> cork: oh...i did $(results).text('y');
[05:00:40] <fat_> thank you so much
[05:00:57] <Cork> fat_: the first part is the selector and the second is what should be in the matched element
[05:01:18] <Richhh> $elect
[05:19:03] <fat_> Cork: if i add another button with the same code, only the first one works.
[05:19:16] <fat_> Cork: do you know how to make it work for all the buttons
[05:21:57] <Cork> fat_: again learn the basics
[05:26:27] <slartsa> fat_: it's a good idea to dig into jQuery literature and create something of your own, something that excites you. That way your knowledge base will build itself
[06:10:49] <daveluke> hi
[06:11:13] <daveluke> since when do variable names correspond dom element ids?
[06:11:55] <Cork> daveluke: since mid 90's
[06:12:31] <daveluke> well, i guess i learned something
[06:12:36] <Cork> and yes it is a frighteningly weird structure
[06:13:28] <daveluke> i started getting js errors only recently
[06:13:46] <daveluke> like checking if a variable was undefined
[06:13:55] <daveluke> i thought my chrome upgraded and this was a new thing
[06:15:06] <Dirkos> Why doesnt this work: $('[data-dismiss="*"]').click(function(){
[06:15:35] <Cork> Dirkos: remove ="*"
[06:17:59] <Dirkos> Cork: thnx
[06:26:52] <martenbrosch> hey there
[06:27:33] <martenbrosch> is it possible to compare an id of a div with an data-attribut of an other element?
[06:27:52] <Cork> martenbrosch: "yes"?
[06:27:56] <martenbrosch> like: if data-attribut of this element is the same like the id of this element, please show the other element
[06:28:02] <martenbrosch> ok thats good
[06:28:16] <martenbrosch> which kind of "campare"-function should i use?
[06:29:42] <Cork> martenbrosch: in what situation do you want to do it?
[06:30:05] <Cork> you could do something like $('#' + $(this).data('attribute')).show()
[06:30:33] <martenbrosch> i ve got a normal list with some links and some hidden divs (maybe it is a little like an accordion) and i want to show() the hidden div via the data-attribut of the link
[06:31:06] <martenbrosch> oh, or could use the same data-attribut for the link and the hidden div
[06:31:25] <Cork> martenbrosch: the id on the target would make it simpler
[06:31:43] <martenbrosch> ok, but the links do not have a "href"
[06:31:55] <Cork> then it shouldn't be a link
[06:32:03] <martenbrosch> not true
[06:32:06] <Cork> yes
[06:32:07] <martenbrosch> it is valid
[06:32:13] <Cork> links are for links, not actions
[06:32:17] <martenbrosch> :D
[06:32:23] <martenbrosch> yeah buttons are for action
[06:32:36] <martenbrosch> but the cms don't allows buttons in the templatefiles, totally sucks
[06:32:45] <Cork> ugg
[06:32:54] <martenbrosch> jepp
[06:32:54] <Cork> so they prefer to do broken links instead...
[06:33:17] <martenbrosch> it isn't broken, it is a "placeholder" :D
[06:33:19] <Cork> anyway that doesn't really matter
[06:33:25] <martenbrosch> true
[06:33:29] <Cork> martenbrosch: a link that you can't load is a broken link
[06:33:41] <martenbrosch> very strict man!
[06:33:47] <Cork> yes
[06:33:56] <martenbrosch> +1 for this
[06:34:00] <Cork> links should work without js, else they should not be links
[06:34:20] <Cork> martenbrosch: js can enhance them, that is totally fine
[06:34:31] <Cork> martenbrosch: anyway that doesn't really matter in the subject
[06:34:33] <martenbrosch> ok ok, i understood ^^
[06:34:41] <martenbrosch> yes
[06:35:04] <martenbrosch> so should i compare if a data-attribut is the same on both elements?
[06:35:10] <Cork> $(parent).on('click', 'a', function() { $('#' + $(this).data('attribute')).toggle(); });
[06:35:27] <Cork> that should get you a toggle solution for the links
[06:35:39] <Cork> a better filter then 'a' would be good though
[06:35:43] <Cork> like a class for example
[06:35:58] <Cork> and i would prob call attribute 'target' instead
[06:36:36] <Cork> and parent is the closest common parent for the (broken)links
[06:36:39] <martenbrosch> uh thats a small solution! much better than my thing ^^
[06:37:36] <martenbrosch> thanks, i'll give it try and know how i should do it
[06:37:38] <martenbrosch> thank you!
[06:37:44] <Cork> np
[06:38:55] <jop008> To day I lost all my images turning my site into this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-10-01_at_3.37.22_PM-5MHcXISr.png
[06:39:02] <jop008> where to look for?
[06:39:22] <jop008> The + on the collapsible item is also gone
[06:39:33] <jop008> maybe wrong loading css?
[06:40:12] <jop008> Yes I shuffled with css 2 day on those pages
[06:46:04] <FernandoBasso> if I set $('#field').origVal = $('#field').val(), should I be able to retrieve origVal later inside an objet's method?
[06:46:22] <FernandoBasso> I do that with pur js, but it seems it is not the case with jQuery.
[06:46:58] <FernandoBasso> I think with pure js tag.origVal is attached in the real live dom node. Is that the case with jQuery as well?

[07:12:09] <CrysAk> Question : i'm trying to setup a fadeout / in to swap out content.. it fades out on but pops in.. any ideas where i'm going wrong? http://paste.ofcode.org/vVXMdJ4X5Z2HxVjAhDkx4k
[07:22:48] <sahbeewah> CrysAk, you're calling fadeIn on the jqxhr returned by post, rather than the element
[07:23:48] <CrysAk> ahh, thanks
[07:25:02] <CrysAk> sahbeewah, got it fading in and out but it won't swapt eh content now, do i need to speficy a unique function? http://paste.ofcode.org/PWy4azxKRNmp7dauhu9jua
[07:27:17] <CrysAk> ok.. slowly getting there, got it fading in with enw content but the new content appears at the end of the fade :((
[07:29:12] <sahbeewah> http://paste.ofcode.org/x9ivisbEySjqhzAhEKiM7C
[07:35:02] <CrysAk> sahbeewah, the new content is still "popping" due to the 2nd use of #image .. how would i go about changing that for a $(this)
[07:37:16] <sahbeewah> don't know what you're talking about
[07:37:47] <sahbeewah> but whatever dom elements get generated from data should have a display: none style to get the effect that you want
[07:38:47] <CrysAk> ahhhh thanks, i'l try adding that
[07:38:59] <ParanoidGal> Anyone know of a way to import a div from one site into another. I need to grab content from the client's main site and embed it on their mobile sub domain
[07:40:19] <ParanoidGal> I was using this when both files were on the same domain but that no longer works http://pastebin.com/Xia1h1KP
[07:41:46] <sahbeewah> ParanoidGal, you may find this useful: http://www.tomhoppe.com/index.php/2008/03/cross-sub-domain-javascript-ajax-iframe-etc/
[07:42:02] <ParanoidGal> You're a star sahbeewah thanks!
[07:44:23] <berndthebrot> hello. i want to fadeIn my submit button if the textfield is not empty. and if the textfield is empty i want to fadeOut. Tried this: http://nopaste.info/bd3c0d2078.html but it doesnt work. any help?
[07:46:45] <sahbeewah> berndthebrot, $("#text").length - finds the number of elements in the dom with the id of text
[07:47:07] <sahbeewah> you're probably after $('#text').val().length
[07:47:29] <davesleeeep> 'lo
[07:48:07] <davesleeeep> can i use fade on .hide() and .show() ?
[07:48:58] <sahbeewah> davesleeeep, say in a different way
[07:50:42] <davesleeeep> like $('.myclass').show().fadeIn(100);
[07:51:42] <sahbeewah> why not just .fadeIn without the show
[07:52:44] <davesleeeep> oh man im an idiot
[07:52:45] <davesleeeep> cheers
[07:53:25] <Radditz> hello
[07:53:34] <Radditz> I just looked at the beforeShow event for binding
[07:53:42] <Radditz> is it compatible with older browsers?
[07:56:51] <sahbeewah> Radditz, it should be compatible with whatever jquery ui promises to be compatible with
[07:57:14] <Radditz> sahbeewah: I googled but I can't find official jquery documentation on the beforeShow
[07:58:30] <sahbeewah> datetimepicker?
[07:58:35] <Radditz> it only works on that?
[07:58:37] <sahbeewah> datepicker, rather
[07:58:41] <Radditz> I need a beforeShow event on a div
[07:58:44] <Radditz> and I saw a jsfiddle on a div
[07:59:18] <sahbeewah> nope, probably doing some custom stuff
[08:00:41] <sahbeewah> you can't have a beforeShow event on a div, unless you have control over the showing method
[08:01:05] <Radditz> hm
[08:01:23] <Radditz>  I have a big page, with a lot of divs, I want to call a method on a div only when the users scrolls down on it
[08:01:31] <Radditz> because it clogs the cpu and takes a long time to load otherwise
[08:03:32] <sahbeewah> i'd probably latch onto the scroll event, and keep a sorted (by vertical offset) list of divs to search through
[08:04:11] <sahbeewah> and you can check the "visibility" of the div via some simple math with screen size and scroll position
[08:04:40] <Radditz> sahbeewah: the problem is that the div may change in size, I pass it to a plot function as a container, and the plot function draws it
[08:05:46] <sahbeewah> don't see why that would be an issue
[08:06:10] <Radditz> how can I know which div to pass depending on the scrolling position?
[08:06:46] <sahbeewah> because you know the vertical offsets of the divs
[08:07:11] <Radditz> so I need to change them everytime they change the size?
[08:07:33] <Radditz> what if position of te div is not absolute?
[08:09:20] <sahbeewah> no you don't need to change anything when they change size because you're storing a reference to the elements itself, and the value of its offset will adjust accordingly as any elements change
[08:09:34] <sahbeewah> offsets are relative to the document and so it doesn't matter
[08:10:17] <Radditz> ok if I understand correctly, you mean to find all the divs that are in the scrolling area? and keep a map to know if I they were "showed" or not?
[08:10:38] <Radditz> I understood at first that based on the scroll position find the div
[08:10:54] <dwarder> is there .doesnHaveClass()
[08:10:58] <dwarder> ?
[08:11:54] <NoiseEee> dwarder: hmmm, try to work logic into hasClass maybe?
[08:12:10] <sahbeewah> Radditz, well you can keep it in a map, i don't know any information about your elements, e.g. whether a container can move above/below others
[08:12:35] <sahbeewah> if it can't you can probably store it in an array and do some intelligent optimizations if it's that intensive
[08:12:53] <Radditz> sahbeewah: I am looking at the jquery scroll documentation and I have no idea what information you get from the scroll event
[08:14:30] <sahbeewah> on scroll, you know the scrollTop has changed, so use that information
[08:16:24] <Radditz> ok sahbeewah thank you, I will take a look into it and try to do it
[08:16:31] <jr3> will: #modal > input:checkbox target all checkboxes in #modal?
[08:16:36] <Radditz> one quick question, how can I have an associative map in javasccript?
[08:16:47] <Radditz> or I should use an array of booleans and use index tricks? as you suggested
[08:17:50] <sahbeewah> Radditz, an associative map in javascript is called a javascript object
[08:18:13] <sahbeewah> var myObject = { 'key': 'value', 'key2': 'value2' };
[08:19:33] <sahbeewah> experiment and see, i would personally use an array of jquery elements
[08:19:52] <Radditz> I think I am going to do simpler
[08:19:59] <sahbeewah> jr3, it will target all checkboxes that are direct descendants of #modal
[08:20:04] <Radditz> I am going to have an int for last div that has been ploted, and for max div
[08:20:12] <jr3> ahh ok
[08:20:22] <Radditz> and I when I scroll a certain number of points below, I will simply plot a few divs
[08:20:23] <jr3> I need #modal input:checked
[08:20:28] <Radditz> I can generate my divs dynamically
[08:20:38] <Radditz> thank you for your help sahbeewah
[08:20:56] <sahbeewah> np
[08:20:59] <sahbeewah> jr3, yes
[08:30:18] <zizzl> Hey guys wondering if there's a popular contact form that uses validation, secure, etc...
[08:41:50] <dwarder> is there a way to check if certain part of dom has finished updating?
[08:42:42] <duch_kazatel> dwarder you can bind to the subtreemodified event.  you can also bind jquery .ready() to almost any element iirc.
[08:51:19] <dwarder> is there a way to check if the click was .trigger()'ed
[08:51:23] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: thank you
[08:51:35] <duch_kazatel> dwarder ... wat?
[08:51:44] <duch_kazatel> "if the click was triggered()?
[08:51:59] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: is there a difference if i click with a mouse or i programmaticaly click it
[08:52:07] <dwarder> with .trigger('click')
[08:52:53] <duch_kazatel> that does basically the same thing.  i'd suggest using .click() though.  looks prettier imo
[08:53:32] <duch_kazatel> and .click() is the same as .trigger('click')
[09:00:09] <ParanoidGal> Total jQuery newbie. Can anyone see why this http://pastebin.com/Tx36zc61 isn't pulling in the banner image from the main page?
[09:00:25] <ParanoidGal> I'm trying to get it to appear on the mobile subdomain at m.lovetefl.com
[09:00:50] <t432> How does the url look for a a Get request with in an ajax call? Does look similar to this? http://localhost/{submited-data}?
[09:03:08] <dwarder> duch_kazatel: so if i need to do something when part of my dom is ready am i need to put ready call in timer?
[09:08:38] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[09:08:57] <Bloomberg> How can I change the background-color of subelement in menu jquery ?
[09:25:38] <FTCHU> I am searching for a javascript developer to work with just in freetime. Please PM me if you are interested. We will make big projects that will have income money like a cloud os etc..
[09:26:48] <EGreg> hey guys
[09:26:52] <EGreg> why does jQuery have scrollTop?
[09:27:49] <jphase> EGreg: To calculate where the element's vertical scroll position is
[09:30:40] <duch_kazatel> you can also use it to scroll the user back up.
[09:33:17] <EGreg> does .animate() work on the whole jquery selection or just the first element?
[09:33:35] <EGreg> also I thought scrollTop was already in every browser as element.scrollTop that's why I was wondering :)
[09:34:16] <duch_kazatel> scrollTop isn't standard last I checked.
[09:34:29] <duch_kazatel> the native method I mean.
[09:35:54] <duch_kazatel> and I'm not sure if animate only works against the first matched object it might.
[09:36:37] <duch_kazatel> actually it looks like it animates anything it matched.
[09:36:39] <jphase> it probably will only match the last one since if it matches more than 1 it's just looping through each
[09:36:50] <jphase> oh .animate
[09:36:59] <duch_kazatel> $('.box').animate({left: 100, top: 100}, 'slow'); looks to work the way you'd want it to.
[10:05:58] <fission6> multi file upload, any recs on plugins
[10:33:00] <zizzl> is there something I can type in the console of dev tools to stop jquery running
[10:33:03] <zizzl> like a slider?
[10:37:20] <rabbi1> how can i return only the content of second level of array object?   var it = $.each(obj, function(i, opts) {
[10:37:20] <rabbi1>     $.each(opts.content, function(i, op) { return op; });  });
[10:37:28] <jphase> zizzl: if there's an event to stop the slider (in the slider's API) then yes
[10:52:21] <fission6> how do i make a input type=file, have  a multiple attirbute
[10:52:50] <jphase> fission6: multiple="multiple" and the filename needs to have [] after it
[10:53:00] <jphase> er name attribute rather than "filename"
[10:53:08] <fission6> interesting thanks, maybe ill just explicitly do that with html vs jquery
[10:53:16] <rabbi1> how can i return only the content of second level of array object?   var it = $.each(obj, function(i, opts) {
[10:53:16] <rabbi1>     $.each(opts.content, function(i, op) { return op; });  });
[10:55:28] <fission6> jphase: why does the name attribute need []
[10:55:44] <jphase> fission6: so it can be an array of filenames on the server side
[10:56:07] <fission6> but how does [] decide that
[10:56:15] <fission6> the browser just uploaded them with the same name no?
[11:00:27] <jphase> fission6: if you have something like:   <input type="file" name="images[]">
[11:00:37] <jphase> AND your form tag has multipart form data enctype
[11:00:55] <jphase> then on the server side you'll get something like (in PHP for example):  $_FILES['images'] and it will be an array
[11:01:21] <fission6> right ok
[11:01:26] <fission6> i don't think the [] is needed
[11:01:31] <fission6> maybe thats a php thing
[11:01:46] <jphase> perhaps not, maybe I'm thinking multidimensional file array
[11:02:45] <jphase> oh yeah, my above example is for having several file inputs
[11:02:47] <jphase> that's why
[11:02:58] <jphase> you can have one input with name="images" and multiple="multiple"
[11:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: what up
[11:18:18] <jphase> hi
[11:21:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> might we continue from yesterday if your up for it
[11:22:19] <jphase> sure, after I'm off work we can
[11:22:26] <jphase> that's basically finished so won't take much time
[11:23:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:23:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw who is in chare of offthewallmedia
[11:23:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> site
[11:23:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> you said it wasnt you but never specified who
[11:23:57] <jphase> my boss decides when he want to afford us working on it, we're in the process of a completely new design
[11:25:38] <jphase> but he's cheap and has horrible design taste and it's like fighting a bengal tiger
[11:26:06] <jphase> 100% of the current site is all him and he loves it, and it makes me want to vomit when I see it
[11:27:00] <jphase> I'm like "Parallax and Flat Responsive Design FTW" and he's like "Drop shadows and rounded corners and Photoshop 4.0 techniques FTL!"
[11:27:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> well....what if i could say i could bring te best of bth worlds
[11:27:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> *both
[11:27:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> or atleast assist
[11:27:49] <jphase> oh?
[11:27:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> (motivation to help: xp.)
[11:28:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i can definitely work with drop shadows and rounded corners
[11:28:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> gradients a bit harder to work wtih
[11:28:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> but could include them
[11:28:56] <jphase> NO! If you were interested in doing a new site design I'd just say do it how you like
[11:29:07] <jphase> your design concepts are mostly parallel with mine
[11:29:59] <jphase> link me to your dribble again
[11:30:06] <jphase> nvm
[11:30:07] <jphase> found it
[11:30:41] <jphase> where's the actual responsive part of your "Jon Sutherland" design
[11:31:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> responsive
[11:31:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> it was never designed for responsive
[11:31:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> atleast most epople dont know that it is
[11:31:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> *people
[11:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i actually am starting to make it responsive
[11:32:10] <jphase> oh gotcha
[11:32:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: should i repo you the files
[11:33:13] <jphase> for sure man
[11:33:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:33:21] <jphase> if you want xp I can help you out for sure
[11:33:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> you really like that design
[11:33:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> bro
[11:33:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay wanna see something freaky
[11:33:44] <jphase> sure
[11:34:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so you know gethighered.ca
[11:34:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> i redesigned for them right
[11:34:42] <jphase> yeah, that's a nice one
[11:34:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you should see where they came from
[11:35:03] <jphase> very similar to the direction we want to go with full screen fixed bg and such
[11:36:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[11:36:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> thing is gethighered.ca isnt responsive
[11:36:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> the project is kinda nuked/abandoned
[11:39:52] <jphase> well if you're serious about this then we should have a conversation a bit later
[11:39:56] <jphase> how is your WordPress knowledge?
[11:39:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: this is before
[11:40:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.gethighered.ca/old%20site/
[11:40:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> WordPress.......uuhhhh not so good
[11:40:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> im ntoa wordpress person
[11:40:19] <jphase> ew
[11:40:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> *not
[11:40:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> whcih i guess is neccessary
[11:40:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> and yes i know
[11:40:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> the design sucked
[11:40:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> so many bugs
[11:40:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the after
[11:40:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> gethighered.ca
[11:40:52] <jphase> all good, our team knows it pretty well, so you don't need to know it if you wanted to work with us
[11:41:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:41:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> i will gladly learn
[11:41:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> no problem
[11:41:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i think i have more to offer along the non-wordpress avenue
[11:42:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: you should check out the rest of the site
[11:42:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> got some nifty ui stuff
[11:42:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: it took me 4 weeks of fighting before they agreed to change to blue
[11:44:26] <jphase> I like the blue, kinda reminds me of a ski resort site or something
[11:44:28] <jphase> with the mtn
[11:44:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:44:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> that was the idea :D
[11:44:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> higher
[11:44:42] <jphase> makes sense
[11:44:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a play on the word hired
[11:45:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: https://github.com/rohanbhangui/greenbracketsprotfoliodesign
[11:45:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> i am currently adjusting the responsiveness of the image gallery
[11:46:37] <mvpgraff> Is there a jquery code for MOD10 Algorithm for ABA Validation? Or will this have to be purely JS?
[11:46:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: your github name is jphase right?
[11:46:55] <drakythe> Pretty basic question, is it possibly to run a .removeClass() on the class you're keying off of? e.g. $('.my-class').removeClass('my-class'); ?
[11:47:19] <jphase> yeah
[11:47:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: lol i finally get your irc name
[11:47:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> very clever
[11:47:38] <jphase> haha
[11:47:46] <jphase> phonetic for my first/last name :D
[11:48:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was pronoucing it
[11:48:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> j-phase
[11:50:31] <jphase> yup
[11:50:41] <jphase> most people don't get it though
[11:50:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[11:51:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways....i have uplaoded my code for jon sutherland tempalte
[11:51:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> listed you as collaborator
[11:51:27] <jphase> k
[11:58:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: we should definitely talk later about giving offthewallmedia a facelift
[11:59:15] <nhulea> hey if I calc the value of an input is there any way to send that value to several places or basically have it global ?
[11:59:32] <jphase> for sure man
[11:59:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> nhulea: in one line no
[11:59:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> but what do oyu mean multiple places
[11:59:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> like as in setting the value of multiple divs
[11:59:56] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: for sure man, let's chat tonight
[12:00:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: cause i gota alot of criticism (including the logo) that if fixed might aid in offthewallmedia looking more presentable
[12:01:46] <nhulea> like I have a function that has function myvar() {  if (var >= 600) {code here}  ) and then I have another one kidna just like it so I wanted to pass that input .val() into there
[12:02:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> wel lthen creat a global var
[12:02:20] <jphase> yeah, we had a logo redone but I don't even like the new one
[12:02:22] <nhulea> hmm I thought I did that let me show you something
[12:02:25] <jphase> it's better, but still ghetto imo
[12:02:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> well let me take a look
[12:03:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> i might be able to see some stuf on dribbble and logo ponder
[12:03:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> may come up with something else
[12:04:11] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/ueJkf/ Rohan_Bhangui  check that
[12:04:53] <nhulea> I am trying to pass that into there var value_all_students
[12:05:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> please define that and there
[12:06:04] <nhulea> but I have several functions like checkdts() that I would need var value_all_students value
[12:06:22] <nhulea> I was trying to not calc it everytime I needed it
[12:07:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> first you have no document .ready
[12:07:51] <nhulea> do I need to do something like function checkdts(value_all_students) {code here }
[12:08:12] <nhulea> yeah I know
[12:08:35] <nhulea> I was just wondering about the global calc of the input
[12:08:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> also all each functions require index
[12:09:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> the global var seems fine
[12:11:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i dont think function() is being called
[12:11:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> checkdts()
[12:12:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> nhulea: i suggest you let the code run free
[12:12:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> meaning get rid of the function
[12:12:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> and just run inside docuemnt.ready
[12:34:26] <berndthebread> how to submit a form with jquery? its an upload form and i want to fire the submit when its uploaded. http://nopaste.info/a5a206def8.html
[12:34:46] <jphase> berndthebread: .trigger('submit')
[12:35:25] <berndthebread> thanks
[12:35:31] <jphase> np
[12:37:33] <berndthebread> the .trigger('submit') on the form?
[12:37:38] <jphase> yeah
[12:39:55] <HenryCH> What would be the best way to keep a connection open and receive data from a database only when the database itself changes? I've been doing it with ajax continuous polling but I'd like to try to implement a more efficient solution..
[12:41:28] <HenryCH> I mean, for example, I want to make a real time user counter, and I've been doing it by sending continuous requests that count query the database, but I guess it would be more efficient to just receive data when a new user actually registers, is there any way to do this?
[12:43:13] <berndthebread> mhh doesnt work jphase
[12:43:28] <berndthebread> what about $('form').submit() ?
[12:44:08] <jphase> breck7: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[12:44:13] <jphase> "A string containing a JavaScript event type, such as click or submit."
[12:44:24] <jphase> it should work just fine, perhaps your selector isn't working?
[12:44:40] <breck7> jphase: i think you meant berndthebread?
[12:44:46] <jphase> woops
[12:44:49] <jphase> yeah sorry
[12:44:59] <freebirD2>  you guys, I need 10 links like this one, but i don't think it's right to create 10 functions, I imagine there's a way to do it faster, how can I create many links with only 1 function calling alertify, help please: http://pastebin.com/VM2ucZn1
[12:46:00] <jphase> freebirD2: write a function that takes a parameter of how many links you want to create and do a for loop to create them
[12:47:01] <berndthebread> jphase. i already have an event which is called, i just want to trigger the submit, without a click or submit?!
[12:47:10] <freebirD2> jphase, I could do that in php as well, but isn't it possible to send a parameter to $("order".param)  ??? would be easyer
[12:47:15] <freebirD2> is it possible ?
[12:47:58] <jphase> berndthebread: $('form').trigger('submit'); will submit first form it finds on the page
[12:49:05] <berndthebread> i used $('#myForm').trigger('submit'); which doesnt submit myForm
[12:49:32] <freebirD2> jphase, what do you think ?
[12:50:04] <jphase> berndthebread: can you console.log('test'); right before your trigger event and see it in the console?
[12:51:31] <jphase> freebirD2: you want to create x amount of links dynamically?
[12:51:48] <nhulea> Rohan_Bhangui: alright I will try that
[12:54:33] <berndthebread> jphase works...shows me test :)
[12:55:17] <boytoy> I'm trying to columnize this list of links: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/27/embedded/result/ -- but I'm not sure what my next move should be. Can someone give me some ideas?
[12:55:17] <jphase> hmm, well .trigger('submit') definitely works, do you have an action and method on your form?
[12:55:21] <freebirD2> jphase, i get it, nevermind man, tks a lot
[12:55:24] <berndthebread> and the other event (fadeIn) is working as well
[12:55:34] <jphase> np
[12:55:41] <berndthebread> an action yes a method (post) as well
[12:55:59] <jphase> hmm, odd
[12:56:59] <jphase> something funny is going on, let me fiddle this for you
[12:59:15] <jphase> berndthebread: are you trying to submit the form to an external domain?
[13:00:15] <berndthebread> external domain? its locally running
[13:00:19] <jphase> berndthebread: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/sDcfx/1/
[13:00:23] <jphase> works like a charm
[13:00:38] <jphase> something isn't firing properly or there's an error, do you have a clean console?
[13:01:18] <ppppp> anyone have advice for a tool to use to make an infinite-scrolling page? Like a grid of thumbnails that loads more when you scroll to the bottom?
[13:01:39] <patchie> how would you do this? http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/1/
[13:01:46] <patchie> the first js line doesnt work :P hehe
[13:02:04] <patchie> ' " hint hint..heh
[13:02:09] <duch_kazatel> ppppp ajax.
[13:02:17] <jphase> ppppp: jQuery masonry's ajax methods will do that all super dope responsive, you can also do it manually with ajax and scrollTop
[13:02:24] <jphase> ^ what duch_kazatel said
[13:03:53] <jphase> patchie: looks like there's an error in your console
[13:04:43] <ppppp> jphase: that looks neat
[13:04:46] <jphase> you just want to select the text in the box?
[13:04:59] <ppppp> Link for anyone else who is curious: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[13:05:35] <boytoy> jphase: no way masonry has built-in infinite scrolling?!
[13:05:46] <jphase> well, "built-in" not necessarily
[13:05:54] <jphase> but easy to bind their ajax loading into a scrollTop check
[13:05:55] <jphase> ;)
[13:06:02] <boytoy> nice :)
[13:06:39] <boytoy> ppppp: also see packery
[13:06:51] <boytoy> aka. masonry v2
[13:07:04] <ppppp> thanks boytoy. And again, link for anyone else curious: http://packery.metafizzy.co/
[13:08:17] <jphase> ooo, didn't know about packery, thx boytoy ;)
[13:08:28] <jphase> love the draggable methods!
[13:08:39] <boytoy> :D
[13:08:46] <ppppp> these are very cool
[13:09:08] <jphase> and they beefed up their documentation too, alrighty then
[13:09:34] <boytoy> ppppp: nice nick btw, i love ppp
[13:10:23] <boytoy> ppp - riding high, classic.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6VfCqN1gOA
[13:12:11] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[13:13:20] <Bloomberg> For example I have three list items, which have the same class but the last have an id , And when I wanna to select them lees of the id, how can I do it?
[13:13:56] <Bloomberg> less*
[13:15:19] <ppppp> alright boytoy jphase and duch_kazatel, I have a bunch of fun stuff to play with now
[13:15:20] <ppppp> :)
[13:15:29] <jphase> Bloomberg: $('.yourclass:not(#yourid)');
[13:15:40] <jphase> hehe, yeah those are quite fun ppppp
[13:15:40] <ppppp> well ajax was a no brainer, but packery and mason are new to me
[13:16:01] <jphase> yeah, just a neat responsive approach to doing what you're doing
[13:16:15] <Bloomberg> jphase : I'm going to test it, but thank you so much
[13:16:39] <jphase> Bloomberg: np, hopefully I understood what you were looking to do
[13:16:43] <ppppp> yeah, in some ways it's overkill because my thumbnails are all already the same size, but I could make them different sizes to make the UI more interesting
[13:17:01] <jphase> Bloomberg: that will select every element with class="yourclass" that doesn't have id="yourid"
[13:17:56] <berndthebread> got my problem. had two open forms (in a tab) and the submit button under it
[13:18:12] <berndthebread> but thanks for your help jphase :)
[13:18:42] <Bloomberg> jphase : works perfect my friend
[13:18:46] <jphase> ahh, gotcha
[13:18:52] <jphase> sweet :D
[13:20:01] <jphase> berndthebread: yeah I knew there had to be something funny in there, glad u got it workin'
[13:20:07] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with jtable plugin?
[13:20:46] <jphase> Bloomberg: no but I've worked with worse implementations of CRUD tables before (i.e. Flexigrid)
[13:20:55] <jphase> doubt that helps hehe
[13:21:06] <Bloomberg> jphase: can show you my script
[13:21:07] <Bloomberg> ?
[13:21:28] <jphase> Bloomberg: hmm, I'm at work and debugging CRUD tables may not be something I have time for atm, what's the issue?
[13:21:57] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/oWIpuCi/1/
[13:22:00] <Bloomberg> this is what I have
[13:22:27] <Bloomberg> My problem is that I need to filter the records in the table with a menu list
[13:22:36] <Bloomberg> but doens't works the filtering!
[13:22:57] <jphase> Bloomberg: if you make a fiddle for it I might be able to help you take a look-see
[13:23:31] <Bloomberg> Yes, I that the info is from the db and the html is larger
[13:23:42] <jphase> hmm
[13:23:43] <Bloomberg> but understand the  script?
[13:24:22] <jphase> it's really tough to troubleshoot data-driven content like this without being able to see the network tab and such. You have a web server?
[13:24:26] <soahccc> Just discovered that data()'s order behaves differently in Firefox and Chrome. What would be the easiest way to sort the result of data() ?
[13:24:40] <Bloomberg> yes
[13:24:51] <Bloomberg> you want see it online?
[13:24:56] <jphase> yes pls
[13:25:28] <Bloomberg> can I talk you PM?
[13:25:43] <jphase> sure
[13:25:47] <jphase> I don't have much time though FYI
[13:25:56] * jphase is on lunch break
[13:28:14] <patchie> jphase: error in my console? what do you mean?
[13:29:18] <duch_kazatel> patchie the console?
[13:29:24] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[13:29:34] <patchie> i was trying IE and chrome
[13:29:40] <patchie> the button doesnt work
[13:29:47] <patchie> http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/1/
[13:29:51] <duch_kazatel> Chrome has a built-in set of developer tools
[13:30:22] <patchie> i think the problem is all the " in line 1
[13:30:28] <patchie> on the javascript side
[13:30:56] <duch_kazatel> patchie do you know what the console is?  it'll tell you exactly where the error is.
[13:32:40] <patchie> chrome -> f12 -> console ?
[13:32:56] <duch_kazatel> yes
[13:33:08] <duch_kazatel> now try to use your code.
[13:33:39] <zizzl> Anyone using Gravity Forms, how can I get the field validation error messages in a pop up window?
[13:33:46] <patchie> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[13:34:48] <patchie> duch_kazatel: thats the error message that comes in the console
[13:34:58] <duch_kazatel> now that do you thing gauced that?
[13:35:04] <duch_kazatel> *caused
[13:35:33] <patchie> forgot this after the function? ;
[13:36:12] <duch_kazatel> pathie you're binding this in your onclick: alert("myFunction()")
[13:36:16] <duch_kazatel> does that look wrong to you at all?
[13:36:27] <patchie> ahh..lol
[13:36:39] <patchie> sorry :P
[13:37:09] <duch_kazatel> inserting HTML like that is generally a bad idea.  are you familiar with jquery's .on() at all?
[13:37:18] <ingof> patchie: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b231dd5d5cf62196bdf2
[13:37:37] <patchie> duch_kazatel: nope
[13:37:40] <ingof> patchie: your variable definintion is also wrong
[13:37:52] <ingof> use a ,
[13:38:41] <patchie> ingof: ohh..thanks!
[13:39:17] <rgoytacaz> Hello there, I got an jquery Ajax call thats changing the html of a form on an event. But weird enough its scrolling to the top of the form, which is a page and a half upwards. Is there a way to prevent it? its using input.change(handler());
[13:39:20] <duch_kazatel> patchie check out jquery's .on() and learn about event delegation.  it's a much better technique.
[13:39:37] <patchie> duch_kazatel: i will check that out! thanks
[13:39:49] <patchie> your so kind in this channel! thanks alot
[13:39:51] <rgoytacaz> it does the scrolling when the code updates the html.
[13:40:03] <duch_kazatel> rgoytacaz have a fiddle for us to play with?
[13:40:33] <jcrawford> can anyone lend a hand with this?  I cannot seem to get the menu on the right side to remain at the top of the screen when scrolling

[13:41:14] <jcrawford> I have it working just fine here: http://home.josephcrawford.com/articles/php/piecrust/mtp-creating-a-default-layout/
[13:41:16] <jcrawford> however it wont work in this new case for some reason.
[13:41:20] <rgoytacaz> duch_kazatel: its on a magento website, so fiddle won't do it justice. =/
[13:41:38] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford you need to set "position: fixed;" somewhere for your menu.
[13:41:40] <Ximerian> I'm dynamicaly created datepicker objects using .append(), but only the original datepicker object works, any that were created through JS with .append don't function as datepickers, can anyone offer some advice
[13:41:45] <rgoytacaz> I searched for it on google, there seems to be tons of problems related to this, but I couldn't find a solution for it.
[13:41:52] <jcrawford> humm
[13:42:15] <duch_kazatel> Ximerian go check out event delegation.
[13:42:23] <ingof> jcrawford: you set the class fixed
[13:42:33] <jcrawford> duch_kazatel: if you looked at my code you would see that was applied when the scroll it past a certain point
[13:42:47] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford I did look at your code ;)
[13:42:48] <ingof> jcrawford: do you also set the css rule : position: fixed for this class ?
[13:42:55] <jcrawford> line 10 in the javascript code
[13:43:18] <Ximerian> duch_kazatel: Ok, thanks!
[13:43:24] <jcrawford> #navigation-wrapper.fixed {
[13:43:24] <jcrawford>     position: fixed;
[13:43:24] <jcrawford>     top: 10px;
[13:43:24] <jcrawford> }
[13:43:39] <jcrawford> yup i set the css
[13:43:58] <jcrawford> updated to include the css: http://jsfiddle.net/qtWsj/1/
[13:44:16] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford it won't work on just jsfiddle?
[13:44:33] <jcrawford> i noticed a lot of times with console.log that top-10 converts to NaN
[13:44:47] <jcrawford> but that never happens on my working version
[13:44:54] <jcrawford> http://home.josephcrawford.com/articles/php/piecrust/mtp-creating-a-default-layout/
[13:45:11] <jcrawford> that works just fine, just cant determine why when they are using similar code
[13:45:12] <duch_kazatel> where is your css?
[13:45:23] <jcrawford> duch_kazatel: i added it to the fiddle see the updated url above
[13:45:28] <patchie> duch_kazatel: ok, i can use .on ...but how do i make the <button> in jquery then?
[13:46:22] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford you need to set position: fixed; on the sidebar div.
[13:46:27] <ingof> jcrawford: try this
[13:46:28] <ingof> http://jsfiddle.net/qtWsj/2/
[13:46:44] <ingof> you have an error in the css selector
[13:46:47] <duch_kazatel> and patchie what do you mean?
[13:47:01] <jcrawford> ingof: what did you do differently?
[13:47:28] <duch_kazatel> patchie you should just create the HTML for the button and then attach the event to the parent container using .on()
[13:47:28] <ingof> jcrawford: your css selector had one space between id and class #navigation-wrapper.fixed
[13:47:37] <ingof> you have to remove it
[13:47:51] <patchie> duch_kazatel: my js line 1 creates a button + makes it clickable... .on fixes only the clickable thing...how do i make this line better? $('#textid').before('<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>');
[13:48:01] <patchie> ahh..ok
[13:48:02] <jcrawford> odd i had tried without the space first and it didn't work so i removed the space and it still wouldn't work
[13:48:08] <jcrawford> thanks ingof
[13:48:13] <ingof> yw
[13:48:39] <duch_kazatel> patchie why are you creating html like that anyway?  why not just put it in the actual html for the page?
[13:49:29] <patchie> this is for a greasemonkey script
[13:49:34] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[13:49:51] <duch_kazatel> you want to just inject the markup without the onclick= stuff.
[13:49:53] <patchie> the ticketsystem we are using at work is so useless :P so i have to fix these things myself ..hehe
[13:50:15] <patchie> aha, ok :) will try
[13:55:56] <patchie> something like this? $('#textid').before('<button>Click Me!</button>').on("click", myFunction());
[13:57:56] <Ximerian> duch_kazatel: I'm having trouble figuring out which event to pass with .on() to get it to fire right, I tried 'change' and 'append'
[13:58:05] <djQuery> patchie, that is not going to return the button so your click is going to be on the #textid isnt it
[14:00:54] <nmsss> hi guys, have a simple prob, copying this code for a resizable iframe: http://jsfiddle.net/B9KgE/. it auto adjusts to browser resizing but if u resize the frame with mouse then it no longer auto adjusts to browser resizing, looking for a solution
[14:01:36] <ingof> nmsss: set the iframe resizeable to false ?
[14:01:40] <patchie> djQuery: this is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/2/
[14:01:44] <ingof> nmsss: is this a option ?
[14:02:05] <patchie> djQuery: it looks like it clicks the button when i load the page
[14:02:58] <nmsss> ingof: i want to be able to resize the iframe with mouse, but i want it to put priority on browser resizing (if user resizes the browser window)
[14:04:13] <djQuery> patchie, thats because you have .on("click", myFunction()) instead of .on("click", myFunction)
[14:04:34] <djQuery> .on("click", myFunction()) immediately runs myFunciton
[14:04:44] <patchie> ahh
[14:05:28] <patchie> djQuery: but this still doesnt work.. http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/3/
[14:05:45] <patchie> i want that function to be run when i press the button
[14:06:07] <ingof> ok
[14:06:11] <ingof> i try
[14:06:47] <djQuery> patchie, I still dont think it is attaching the on to the button as I am not sure what the before is returning
[14:07:03] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/31/embedded/result/ -- is the stuff under "My plan" the best way to go about columnizing my links? I just wanna be sure I'm on the right track before I start coding this thing.
[14:09:20] <patchie> djQuery: easier like this? http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/5/
[14:09:32] <patchie> but still doesnt work...line 1 works...but not line 2
[14:09:33] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/6/
[14:10:18] <patchie> djQuery: well..that does the same as my previous code :)
[14:10:33] <patchie> you just flip it around
[14:12:12] <patchie> but still doesnt work :P
[14:13:46] <djQuery> damn browser
[14:13:59] <djQuery> patchie haveing some browser issues gimme a sec
[14:14:06] <patchie> hehe, ok :)
[14:15:53] <djQuery> patchie, http://jsfiddle.net/hNfZm/8/
[14:16:11] <djQuery> probably have on wrong I always put them in wrong order
[14:17:12] <patchie> doesnt work?
[14:17:22] <patchie> does it work for you?
[14:20:15] <djQuery> patchie, no I thought it was all the loading errors my browser is getting though
[14:20:41] <patchie> hehe
[14:21:26] <djQuery> patchie, the easiest thing to do would be to break the .on out into a seperate selector like I was trying to do there
[14:22:07] <patchie> ok..i will try to troubleshoot more tomorrow..thanks for your help :)
[14:23:06] <ingof> nmsss: the only solution i have would be to make a debounced $(document).resize() listener and delete the style attr from #resizable
[14:24:56] <nmsss> ingof: hmmm ok
[14:24:59] <nmsss> ingof: thank you
[14:25:09] <nmsss> ingof: i will look into that
[14:25:23] <nmsss> thanks very much :)))))))))))))
[14:25:46] <ingof> nmsss: sorry couldn't create a running demo
[14:27:21] <nmsss> ingof: no worries lol, thanks for the advice i will read into it
[14:27:52] <t4nk305> Hi
[14:27:53] <MariusIT> guys, a silly question but for a submit button with a landing page that expects a get request, what should i use .post or .get ?
[14:29:27] <MariusIT> nvm
[14:30:21] <t4nk305> Question: I am sending jquery ajax GET request (datatype:jsonp since cross domain) . Problem: Both my sucess and error functions get executed . First success function (The request is successful because i get status code 200) but i error saying "Syntax Error". The url i am trying to access has "<?xml version="1.0"?><!--" on its page . what to do ?
[14:31:11] <djQuery> patchie, http://jsbin.com/OLUwewA/1/edit
[14:32:26] <djQuery> ?tell
[14:32:45] <djQuery> are there no bots on today?
[14:34:32] <t4nk305> Here is my code - http://jsbin.com/ocaqACi/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[14:38:06] <t4nk305> Help ?
[14:39:52] <ingof> thinking :p
[14:43:49] <ingof> can you give me the exact error msg ?
[14:46:04] <t4nk305> @inof me ?
[14:47:01] <ingof> t4nk305: yep - but i already have read that jsonp can only return js, no xml
[14:47:36] <ingof> t4nk305: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3435454/using-jsonp-when-returning-xml maybe this helps you along
[14:49:06] <t4nk305> @ingof thanks .. One more question : Is there a better way of requesting cross domian request instead of using jsonp ? ( I know we can do with native java ) but is there a way using jsor jquery?
[14:49:57] <jphase> jsonp is the jQuery appraoch to CORS normally
[14:50:01] <jphase> approach*
[14:50:32] <jphase> but if you need HTML/XML/XHTML you can use .load
[14:50:50] <ingof> yep
[14:52:35] <t4nk305> using .load can extract specific stuff from the response
[14:53:31] <jphase> yeah
[14:53:47] <ingof> t4nk305: if you need xml maybe this helps you out: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/quick-tip-cross-domain-ajax-request-with-yql-and-jquery/
[14:54:52] <t4nk305> Thank you
[14:55:07] <ingof> yw
[14:59:53] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/34/embedded/result/ -- is this how one should split links into columns if needed, or is there an easier way?
[15:06:03] <jphase> boytoy: can you not just create a table around your anchor tags?
[15:21:36] <boytoy> jphase: Hey, yeah that's a brilliant idea!
[15:22:46] <boytoy> jphase: So that replaces steps 2-7 or the whole shazaaaam?
[15:23:04] <djQuery> jphase, boytoy, yuck tables why not just use an <ul> with the correct css applied to it
[15:23:20] <djQuery> it could be single or multi collumn
[15:23:54] <boytoy> djQuery: Well when W3C first made ul's they were only be intended to be used for typographical lists. Why everyone's now using them to represent any collection of items is beyond me
[15:23:58] <djQuery> just set it to be horizontal if you want multple collumns
[15:24:13] <boytoy> djQuery: Whether ul or div though, I don't think this can be achieved using pure CSS
[15:24:34] <djQuery> boytoy, yes but tables render so frigin slow
[15:25:10] <boytoy> hmm..
[15:25:33] <obert> if they arent tabular data makes no sense to mark not-tabular data with a tag used to mark tabular data
[15:25:47] <jphase> hmm, I think when you need to display things as a table, it's much easier to just use tables
[15:26:07] <boytoy> obert: yeah good point
[15:26:09] <jphase> if you want to have the headache of display: table and table-cell and table-row, you'll still need to modify your markup anyhow since you'll need a row element
[15:26:57] <jphase> it would be quite easy to change the markup to a table on the fly since you're actually needing to display things as a table
[15:27:13] <boytoy> jphase: yup
[15:27:15] <jphase> this would be a good job for .each + .wrap  :D
[15:27:31] <boytoy> jphase: but i still need to calculate the max height of the thing right?
[15:27:37] <boytoy> .each + .wrap sounds good =)
[15:28:41] <boytoy> hmm something smells burned
[15:28:45] <boytoy> oh fuck my chicken
[15:28:45] <boytoy> brb
[15:30:42] <djQuery> boytoy, http://jsbin.com/uyipEsi/1/edit
[15:41:07] <boytoy> djQuery: i appreciate that but unfortunately each column needs a different width
[15:51:05] <t4nk305> @jphase
[15:54:39] <t4nk305> @jphase I have used YQL to avoid cross -domain and now my success method is executing . But in response the content type is text/javascript but i want application/xml
[15:54:42] <b-ot> t4nk305: andnowmysuccessmethodisexecutingbutinresponsethe.co - ☺ AVAILABLE
[15:54:55] <t4nk305> http://jsbin.com/onUsani/1/
[15:55:25] <t4nk305> Hi b-ot
[15:55:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> !api i love this  guy
[15:56:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> damn not a command
[16:04:25] <jphase> t4nk305: you have some issues here, $ is not defined for me on this page
[16:08:51] <jphase> nvm, my page must've been cached?
[16:12:26] <t4nk305> @iphase yaa
[16:16:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i dunno if im gonna get to sit down with you regarding the offthewallmedia stuff
[16:16:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> abit swamped in work at my end
[16:17:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> t4nk305: if you want to get jphase attention use his name followed by colon
[16:18:14] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: okay, all good... you're in school man
[16:18:37] <t4nk305> Thanks Rohan_Bhangui;
[16:18:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ill try to get done....its not so much school work i just put it off
[16:18:44] <t4nk305> Thanks Rohan_Bhangui:
[16:18:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> t4nk305: np
[16:19:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> well you want to try something like what  i did t4nk305
[16:19:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^^
[16:19:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: me lazy like that  :)
[16:19:36] <jphase> t4nk305: is your format supposed to be "xml'"   with the ' in it?
[16:19:58] <jphase> t4nk305: cause that's what you're sending off to YUI
[16:21:54] <boytoy> jphase: i think i just got the blessing from #css to use tables for this thing too so.. off we go =)
[16:22:36] <jphase> hehe
[16:22:46] <jphase> there are reasons for using tables... this is one of them boytoy
[16:22:47] <t4nk305> jphase: Yes , For example https://hub.jazz.net/jts/rootservices , Can i access the data from that url ? using my script
[16:23:23] <boytoy> yep :D
[16:23:42] <t4nk305> jphase: For example jd:discovery rdf:resource="https://hub.jazz.net/jts/discovery from  https://hub.jazz.net/jts/rootservices
[16:25:39] <jphase> t4nk305: http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/io/ you read this yet?
[16:27:40] <CorySimmons> Any idea why this isn't applying an attribute to all the links? http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/yAzon
[16:29:43] <jphase> CorySimmons: some weird stuff going on there
[16:29:55] <adoming> Hey guys, I have a button that I am using for AJAX POST and on success am replacing the pause button with a start button.  I am able to click once on the button and get desired result.  But upon clicking the same button can not change back to it's original state.  Any help much appreciated http://pastebin.com/FutvyyEJ.
[16:29:56] <jphase> CorySimmons: the top two lines of jQuery aren't valid
[16:33:45] <jphase> CorySimmons: Are you trying to add target="_blank" to all your <a> tags that don't have a hash in them?
[16:33:46] <ngharo> adoming: first use $(this) instead of $("#"+campaign_id)
[16:34:01] <jphase> CorySimmons: if so, try something like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/kSKBZ/
[16:35:14] <ngharo> adoming: then change your click handler to $('#some-parent-container').on('click, '.start', function() { ... });
[16:36:33] <ngharo> adoming: for why, see http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:36:41] <ngharo> note the bold sentence
[16:39:01] <CorySimmons> jphase: I'm trying to get # links to NOT open in a new tab of the parent viewport, and I'm trying to get links w/o # to open in a new tab http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/yAzon
[16:39:03] <adoming> ngharo: thank you.  I should have noted that there can be multiple attr ids.  Since I cannot guarantee unique parent container can I swap that out for the var campaign_id?
[16:39:26] <CorySimmons> jphase: right now codepen has the problem of anytime someone puts a link in their pen, it opens in the iframe X_X
[16:39:32] <adoming> ngharo: I am working through your solution
[16:39:48] <ngharo> $(this) will always refer to the element that was clicked
[16:40:10] <adoming> ngharo: ah I see
[16:40:17] <ngharo> so it doesn't make sense to grab the ID of `this` (which is unique) and requery for it
[16:40:25] <CorySimmons> I've updated my demo. It looks right in the iframe's code, but it's not behaving as expected.. :(
[16:40:52] <jphase> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vlIAj
[16:41:01] <jphase> all a links have target _blank now
[16:41:06] <jphase> that what you're trying to do?
[16:41:14] <adoming> ngharo: makes sense - I'm making changes. one moment.
[16:41:29] <jphase> or do you need something else?
[16:41:51] <ngharo> adoming: also your .each() will never be more than one element, so get rid of it :)
[16:42:18] <ngharo> maybe you want $('.pause').each( ... ), etc
[16:44:04] <CorySimmons> jphase: in your pen, look at your last link, click on it
[16:44:17] <CorySimmons> ….yyyyyeeeaaaaaahhhh see now? :D
[16:45:10] <lehl0r> hey guys i got a problem when creating a click event for dynamic generated buttons maybe someone can help me:
[16:45:11] <lehl0r> http://pastebin.com/tGAQ0Sxr
[16:45:16] <lehl0r> here is my function
[16:45:20] <jphase> CorySimmons: Are you trying to open a new tab from an iframe??
[16:45:32] <jphase> like, specifically with code pen that is?
[16:45:35] <lehl0r> which is taking some xml elements and making a button click event
[16:45:49] <CorySimmons> jphase: Yeah, a new tab for the parent window (the original window)
[16:46:00] <CorySimmons> gotta run out and get my son some food, brb thanks for your interest in this though
[16:46:06] <adoming> ngharo: thank you, the solution worked
[16:46:09] <jphase> CorySimmons: you can change the location of the parent window, but not a tab
[16:46:14] <lehl0r> however the click event
[16:46:15] <adoming> ngharo: sincere thanks
[16:46:57] <lehl0r> does not work
[16:47:11] <lehl0r> or it does add the id of the last element to all buttons
[16:47:21] <lehl0r> so every button has the last element
[16:47:30] <lehl0r> i dunno why
[16:48:29] <lehl0r> so every button has a different id attribute
[16:48:53] <lehl0r> but the value for the datasetID is always the one from the last element added
[16:55:16] <ngharo> lehl0r: try doing .data('dataset-id', blah.blah.nodeValue).on('click', function() { var datasetID = $(this).data('dataset-id'); });
[16:55:23] <ngharo> instead of your current click handler
[16:57:11] <lehl0r> ty i will try that
[16:58:28] <lehl0r> but i dont understand the first .data , because it seems like the actual click works for every element ?
[16:58:36] <ngharo> whats happening is once your click fires, you've already iterated through the array and Dataset is referencing the last one
[16:59:34] <ngharo> putting that your value in a data attribute tacks it right onto the element (and should be pointing to the correct data)
[16:59:57] <lehl0r> what does the .data('dataset-id' line at the beginning do ?
[17:00:16] <lehl0r> because i need the event on every button with the id #bt + name blablabla
[17:00:23] <ngharo> its a way of storing arbitrary data on elements
[17:05:20] <ngharo> lehl0r: http://paste.debian.net/48124/
[17:05:59] <ngharo> tagged elements with a class so you have one click handler in document ready
[17:07:34] <user_student> Algum brasileiro?
[17:08:39] <lehl0r> ok ty i try that out
[17:09:07] <user_student> I need more information about jquery for my paper.
[17:10:59] <user_student> my paper = scientific work
[17:12:02] <user_student> scientific work
[17:12:11] <user_student> Someone can help-me?
[17:12:26] <mvpgraff> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery
[17:12:47] <jphase> mvpgraff++;
[17:13:52] <user_student> haha, the official page of jquery have little information about what is and what good that library
[17:14:12] <mvpgraff> you must not be researching enough then :l
[17:14:39] <lehl0r> google has other results on jquery probably
[17:16:06] <djQuery> jquery comaprision
[17:16:48] <user_student> Yeah, but i don't need examples of implementations or how include jquery in html files. I want informations about which the purpose of the library, which its main function, etc.
[17:16:55] <ngharo> lehl0r: im trying to jqueryify some of the yucky: http://paste.debian.net/48131/
[17:17:00] <suyase> Hey, I'm starting development of a web application for mobile devices. I decided to use jquery. I've never developed a web application before. I have a good understanding of programming and protocols operating at lower levels than HTTP, but in this case I know very little. I do not know whether scripts exist within pages or as separate objects that are loaded as resources, or how any of that is handled. What is a good tutorial for me?
[17:17:20] <user_student> Scientific information and not techniques
[17:17:50] <lehl0r> well ty :-)
[17:17:55] <ngharo> perhaps you should state a scientific question :)
[17:17:58] <suyase> e.g. I can write a half adder in C, but I have no idea how to start putting this thing together
[17:18:16] <CorySimmons> jphase: How can I change the parent window location?
[17:18:30] <CorySimmons> watching daily show with kiddo XD
[17:18:33] <jphase> window.parent.href = 'http://google.com';
[17:18:35] <CorySimmons> <3 this kid
[17:18:40] <CorySimmons> Ah, thanks jphase
[17:18:49] <ngharo> CorySimmons: you just answered it yourself lol. parent.window.location
[17:20:12] <LindsayMac> I'm habing issues with a simple show/hide based on select form value http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/TKZGz/3/
[17:20:40] <LindsayMac> i dunno why, but its "kinda" working on my live site but not on this fiddel. I can't even get the two to show the SAME issues. derp
[17:20:40] <user_student> Why jquery is a library? Before she was said to be a framework.
[17:21:03] <LindsayMac> AH
[17:21:07] <LindsayMac> OOPS
[17:21:13] <LindsayMac> http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/TKZGz/4/
[17:21:14] <LindsayMac> ok
[17:21:47] <ngharo> LindsayMac: what's the problem?
[17:21:57] <ngharo> dat whitespace
[17:22:10] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  strangely.. On my LIVE site, when I switch back to the "photo" select box, the #photo div does not show
[17:22:12] <BrianPeacock> .show and .hide simply hide and show using css display none no sliding as your comments say
[17:22:27] <LindsayMac> BrianPeacock:  i know this. I wrote it.. but there's simething strange
[17:22:38] <LindsayMac> I was hoping to be able to replicate on jsfiddle.. but seems I can not
[17:22:47] <ngharo> link to live site?
[17:23:02] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  gimme one min
[17:23:07] <LindsayMac> then I can link to live
[17:23:27] <user_student> Jquery is indicated for responsive design? Why?
[17:23:39] <LindsayMac> Oh wow. I fixed it!
[17:23:52] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  thanks for the offer to help. Sometimes you just need to ASK for help, and somehow your brain fixes it. lol
[17:24:08] <lehl0r> @userstudent because u can easily manipulate elements
[17:24:15] <lehl0r> before media queries
[17:24:35] <lehl0r> came
[17:24:40] <mvpgraff> LindsayMac, I was about to say
[17:24:43] <mvpgraff> It works for me
[17:24:44] <mvpgraff> lol
[17:24:56] <djQuery> LindsayMac, how about this? http://jsfiddle.net/TKZGz/5/
[17:25:15] <user_student> Why not use pure javascript? Jquery loses performance when loading the page, no?
[17:25:28] <LindsayMac> mvpgraff:  yea it worked on fiddle.. not on live site.. then I found my typo
[17:25:45] <mvpgraff> : P
[17:25:50] <LindsayMac> user_student:  jquery is a library of cool javascript things that make it easier for you to write for
[17:25:54] <mvpgraff> well good luck on your form!
[17:25:56] <LindsayMac> So you aren't reinventing the wheel
[17:25:59] <LindsayMac> mvpgraff:  thanks  ha
[17:26:05] <LindsayMac> damn form s
[17:26:12] <djQuery> user_student, because of the difference in syntax between different browsers. this becoming less of an issue as more correctly impliment the standards
[17:26:15] <mvpgraff> I currently use that same hide/show for certain questions
[17:26:16] <djQuery> and ie dies
[17:26:16] <mvpgraff> on my forms
[17:26:24] <mvpgraff> =p
[17:26:31] <LindsayMac> mvpgraff:  yea. I need to rework my validation now because of it though
[17:26:40] <mvpgraff> hmmm
[17:26:42] <LindsayMac> originally was simply validating via php form submission
[17:26:48] <LindsayMac> now i need to validate on the fly
[17:26:53] <djQuery> LindsayMac, did you see my version?
[17:27:08] <LindsayMac> jphase:  yea.
[17:27:10] <LindsayMac> thanks
[17:27:27] <LindsayMac> djQuery: that isn't going to work with multiple values
[17:27:37] <LindsayMac> this is just a pared down text scenario .
[17:27:44] <LindsayMac> but i like the simplified nature.
[17:27:49] <mvpgraff> well, if it's hiding it won't require the validation, so you can easily do the normal required: true for that input.
[17:28:09] <LindsayMac> mvpgraff:  you should still validate even if a form element is hidden just in case bots / hackers
[17:28:22] <LindsayMac> right?
[17:28:25] <mvpgraff> i do validate, but only if it's showing
[17:28:35] <mvpgraff> once it's in hide
[17:28:39] <LindsayMac> but don't you worry about bots injecting via hidden forms?
[17:28:47] <LindsayMac> erm fields
[17:29:09] <jphase> sup LindsayMac?
[17:29:14] <LindsayMac> hi
[17:29:15] <mvpgraff> nah, i just write that if it's empty it's null
[17:29:35] <mvpgraff> i'll explain soon :D heading out
[17:29:39] <mvpgraff> will log in from home
[17:29:42] <LindsayMac> NBut what I'm saying is a malicious coder could put stuff inside of fields that are hidden via display:none
[17:29:51] <LindsayMac> thus, they are no longer NULL if there's stuff in them
[17:29:54] <LindsayMac> k
[17:33:06] <user_student> Some people say that mootools is better suited than jquery. What is the main difference between them?
[17:33:16] <boytoy> LindsayMac: i could be wrong but isnt that why people recommend server-side validation in addition to client-side?
[17:33:37] <LindsayMac> boytoy:  there's some good client side validation as well as server side
[17:33:41] <boytoy> to make sure stuff like that doesnt pass through
[17:33:51] <suyase> How do I start building applications using jquery?
[17:34:15] <boytoy> yup definitely.. so far ive been server-side only but i thought id do it client-side as well to make it a bit more enjoyable for my users
[17:34:40] <LindsayMac> boytoy:  yea.. i had preliminary validation in my server side code as well... so all I was saying was that I needed to switch to doing basic validation via client side
[17:34:52] <LindsayMac> then I can do some last chance validation server side
[17:35:43] <boytoy> yeah that sounds like a solid game plan.
[17:36:24] <boytoy> so i heard malicious coders can easily bypass client-side validations.. but if one has server-side as well the malicious coder is fucked so theres no need to worry there.. thats correct right?
[17:37:11] <pixelpimp> pretty accurate, yes.  best to have both.  always have server-side.  but nothing is 100%.
[17:37:28] <user_student> You indicate the jquery for all occasions?
[17:37:32] <pixelpimp> client-side is super nice for a great loking form
[17:37:56] <pixelpimp> i.e. is my username already taken?  oops, you've submitted your form and lost half the data somehow
[17:38:23] <boytoy> hehe
[17:38:30] <boytoy> cool thanks for the confirmation
[17:38:45] <djQuery> LindsayMac, had to do it this way once http://jsfiddle.net/TKZGz/7/
[17:39:12] <LindsayMac> pixelpimp:  OMG SO ANNOYING.. I HATE THAT
[17:39:27] <LindsayMac> djQuery:  that is pretty. thanks!
[17:39:56] <djQuery> LindsayMac, I had an option with a lot of values
[17:40:16] <LindsayMac> yea so that is nice and clean way to do it
[17:40:17] <LindsayMac> tanks
[17:40:19] <LindsayMac> thanks*
[17:40:21] <user_student> Only I think for the development of responsive applications jquery can not be indicated?
[17:40:30] <boytoy> jphase: still there? curious what you think about my new master plan: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/41/embedded/result/
[17:40:55] <boytoy> (now using tables since LindsayMac, pixelpimp and the other cats in #css gave me their blessings)
[17:40:56] <LindsayMac> user_student:  you make VERY little sense
[17:41:03] <jphase> hehe
[17:41:08] <LindsayMac> uh oh.. flaming wars begin!
[17:41:17] <jphase> boytoy: sounds like a plan, it's a good use for tables
[17:41:35] <LindsayMac> YAY`
[17:41:35] <boytoy> jphase: cool.. and my steps 1-6 make sense too?
[17:41:37] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:42:00] <boytoy> LindsayMac: yeah he was actually the first one to recommend tables
[17:42:14] <LindsayMac> lol
[17:42:44] <hugo-m> hi lindsaymac
[17:42:44] <user_student> :'(
[17:45:44] <boytoy> * http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/43/embedded/result/ (grammar)
[17:46:24] <boytoy> user_student: theres a brazilian chick that usually hangs around here, you should wait for her
[17:46:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> boytoy: ????
[17:47:03] <boytoy> user_student: YammYcoding, remember the name
[17:47:33] <boytoy> Rohan_Bhangui: hey bro, what?
[17:47:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey?
[17:47:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats this abouta brazilian chick?
[17:47:53] <boytoy> lol
[17:48:10] <LindsayMac> Oh yea. I know yammy
[17:49:58] <suyase> How do I start using jquery mobile?
[17:50:49] <pixelpimp> probably pretty easy to find a tutorial
[17:51:00] <lehl0r> ngharo: ty works like a charm
[17:51:06] <suyase> I have tried looking over the W3C schools guide for Jquery and AJAX, but unfortunately I do not have a conceptual basis in website design, so I am not sure how the jquery is delivered to a client
[17:51:28] <pixelpimp> http://jquerymobile.com/resources/
[17:51:34] <suyase> pixelpimp: There are many tutorials, yes, but they assume I already understand how jquery should be used (as in, they assume I am a web developer)
[17:51:52] <pixelpimp> you'll probably need to learn some web development stuff, then
[17:51:55] <duch_kazatel> suyase err, then learn jquery?
[17:52:07] <duch_kazatel> you want to do ajax but don't want to learn how.
[17:52:15] <pixelpimp> you'll certainly need to be familiar with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript (though most of that will be very jQuery-specific)
[17:52:49] <suyase> duch_kazatel: The issue is not that I do not want to learn. I am unsure of how to begin, as the 'beginning' materials I have see so far require understanding of web architecture that I do not have
[17:52:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: trial and error
[17:52:57] <suyase> pixelpimp: Ah, thank you, so jquery is used in HTML forms?
[17:53:07] <pixelpimp> if you want it to be, sure
[17:53:10] <suyase> Rohan_Bhangui: Where, precisely, would I conduct trial and error experimentation?
[17:53:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> well think of a simple app
[17:53:25] <duch_kazatel> suyase on your computer
[17:53:28] <pixelpimp> jquery can do a whole hell of a lot of stuff
[17:53:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^^
[17:53:35] <suyase> Rohan_Bhangui: To me, a simple app is an adder
[17:53:41] <duch_kazatel> you can create a file called athing.html and then put code in there.
[17:53:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> well here is what i mean
[17:53:51] <duch_kazatel> and then open it in a web browser.
[17:53:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: let me upload an old project
[17:53:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can check out code
[17:54:02] <suyase> duch_kazatel: Ah, thank you
[17:54:17] <suyase> duch_kazatel: So the content is loaded dynamically from files hosted on the server?
[17:54:22] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:54:44] <suyase> duch_kazatel: The jquery application logic is loaded from files hosted on a server when clients request them?
[17:54:56] <duch_kazatel> sort of?
[17:54:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: http://ge.tt/2jMptXt/v/0?c
[17:55:00] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a library.
[17:55:01] <suyase> duch_kazatel: or the server executes the logic?
[17:55:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> its nothing great
[17:55:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> its just a start
[17:55:08] <duch_kazatel> oh, the client does.
[17:55:16] <suyase> Oh, it's a library? what language is it for?
[17:55:20] <duch_kazatel> javascript.
[17:55:21] <suyase> I thought it was a language o_O
[17:55:22] <suyase> OH
[17:55:23] <duch_kazatel> jquery is not a language.
[17:55:27] <suyase> everything makes a lot more sense
[17:55:28] <duch_kazatel> jquery is javascript.
[17:55:30] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:55:40] <duch_kazatel> what sort of background do you come from?
[17:55:44] <suyase> I'm a software engineer
[17:55:54] <suyase> I work in C#, Python, C . . .
[17:55:56] <suyase> ASM
[17:56:06] <duch_kazatel> aaaah
[17:56:09] <suyase> I mostly do algorithm design
[17:56:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah, jquery is just javascript.
[17:56:13] <suyase> and build back end architecture
[17:56:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: you have strong base
[17:56:25] <suyase> so the front end stuff is like...completely unknown to me..it's a big mystery =P
[17:56:33] <suyase> Rohan_Bhangui: Thanks, I've been working on it for years =P
[17:56:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: i would start at plain jquery in that case
[17:56:41] <user_student> library or framework? o.O
[17:56:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: I myself come from java
[17:56:47] <duch_kazatel> i'd suggest javascript to him rightnow.
[17:56:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> duch_kazatel: agreeed
[17:57:04] <duch_kazatel> user_student it's a library not a framework.
[17:57:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i personally learnt the other way around jquery first than javscirpt
[17:57:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> *javascript
[17:57:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: but yes start with javascript
[17:58:01] <suyase> I'll look into javascript to make sure I know how javascript is implemented (like, written, compiled/interpreted, run, etc.) - I don't even know WHERE javascript runs - I guess maybe client side? but I have no idea how you would like...not...just...give the client access to  all of your resources but deliver the resources via application logic they run locally....
[17:58:05] <suyase> thanks =D
[17:58:12] <suyase> you guys have been extremely helpful, I appreciate it
[17:58:22] <duch_kazatel> javascript runs in the browser on a javascript engine.
[17:58:26] <pixelpimp> are you familiar with MVC?
[17:58:26] <duch_kazatel> like V8 or SpiderMonkey
[17:58:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: javascript is front end
[17:58:51] <duch_kazatel> think of it kind of like jit compilation.
[17:58:55] <suyase> Ahhh
[17:58:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> ??
[17:59:05] <duch_kazatel> almost like python.
[17:59:14] <suyase> So there's an interpreter VM loop in the browser that interprets and executes javascript
[17:59:16] <duch_kazatel> no compilation step that you / the end user needs to worry about.
[17:59:32] <duch_kazatel> it's not necessarily a vm.
[17:59:33] <suyase> not familiar wth MVC
[17:59:35] <suyase> *with
[18:00:03] <duch_kazatel> suyase the thing about js is anything you want the client side to execute has to be delivered to them.
[18:00:11] <suyase> duch_kazatel: right
[18:00:14] <suyase> hmm
[18:00:33] <duch_kazatel> so you do most of your "heavy lifting" server side, crafting JSON or markup fragments, and then use JavaScript to append/delete/modify/etc.
[18:00:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> suyase: best place to start if you dont wnat toventure yourself
[18:00:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.codecademy.com/
[18:00:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.codecademy.com/learn
[18:01:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> they have jquery and javascript tuts
[18:01:06] <pixelpimp> lol.. quickly reading that, I read "torment yourself"
[18:01:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> with on the spot try it yourselfs
[18:01:18] <suyase> awesome
[18:01:22] <duch_kazatel> the idea behind ajax is making http requests to a server which then returns data.
[18:01:29] <duch_kazatel> and then doing stuff with the data.
[18:01:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: lol my fucking typing is off today
[18:01:32] <suyase> so, javascript->jquery->AJAX
[18:01:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> im running on fumes
[18:01:40] <duch_kazatel> ajax can be done without jquery.
[18:01:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> more like
[18:01:49] <duch_kazatel> ajax is a technique.
[18:01:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> javascript/jquery -> AJAX
[18:02:05] <duch_kazatel> it's short for "asynchronous javascript and XML"
[18:02:13] <suyase> duch_kazatel: Yea, wikipedia said asynchronous javascript and XML or something, and the first and last words of that make perfect sense to me
[18:02:15] <duch_kazatel> though you don't have to use XML.
[18:02:33] <suyase> XML is heinous, but convenient in a pinch
[18:02:39] <duch_kazatel> XML is great.
[18:02:42] <duch_kazatel> if you need markup.
[18:02:45] <suyase> well, sorry
[18:02:50] <suyase> on backend architecture
[18:02:52] <duch_kazatel> you can use JSON these days.
[18:02:54] <user_student> but XML is necessary? And JSON?
[18:02:55] <duch_kazatel> for frontent.
[18:03:00] <duch_kazatel> *frontend.
[18:03:01] <suyase> we usually see XML in bad places
[18:03:09] <suyase> like places where nobody will ever read it and it needs to be fast
[18:03:15] <suyase> like places where ASN.1 should have been used
[18:03:30] <duch_kazatel> lol XSLT is great for parsing XML.
[18:03:36] <suyase> yes
[18:03:39] <suyase> it's also slow =P
[18:03:41] <duch_kazatel> and it can be plenty fast.
[18:03:46] <duch_kazatel> depends entirely on what you're doing.
[18:04:01] <suyase> I should've said 'wasteful' instead of implying it was slow I suppose
[18:04:33] * jphase prefers if API transactions aren't delivered and received with XML
[18:04:34] <duch_kazatel> DOM-based parsing is actually pretty neat.
[18:04:45] <duch_kazatel> and can be VERY efficient depending on your needs.
[18:04:53] <suyase> hmm
[18:04:56] <suyase> I'll keep it in mind
[18:05:02] <duch_kazatel> as opposed to, say, SAX.  but it's all about what your need.
[18:05:04] <duch_kazatel> *you need
[18:05:13] <suyase> this is all related to a competition by the way
[18:05:29] <duch_kazatel> hrm?>
[18:05:32] <suyase> my office is having a 'throw stuff together using tools you never have and never would use' competition
[18:05:40] <suyase> best 'thingy' wins
[18:05:45] <ankurk> Can any help me with this issue? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19128412/saving-checked-box-value-as-0-or-1-in-the-database-from-ajax-post
[18:05:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> ????
[18:06:33] <suyase> Like, I'm building a web app right?
[18:06:37] <duch_kazatel> suyase aaaah.  yeah jquery is great for stuff where you want results quickly, but you'll need to build a foundation on HTML and CSS to understand./
[18:06:42] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I'm headed to the bar, I'll chat with you in 10 mins or so
[18:06:48] <suyase> duch_kazatel: that's part of the fun =P
[18:06:58] <duch_kazatel> aye.
[18:07:27] <duch_kazatel> some things to note: javascript might look object oriented at first glance, but it isn't.
[18:07:34] <duch_kazatel> that will save you some headaches.
[18:07:44] <suyase> duch_kazatel: thanks
[18:08:06] <duch_kazatel> it's got a prototypal inheritance model that will throw you for a loop initially, but it's actually kind of neat.
[18:08:15] <suyase> duch_kazatel: okay
[18:08:31] <suyase> duch_kazatel: If I wanted to load a crapload of images
[18:08:43] <suyase> duch_kazatel: I mean, I see how it would be done
[18:09:29] <duch_kazatel> you wouldn't use ajax for that.  you'd just make an img tag and set the src attribute to wherever the file is.
[18:10:32] <suyase> duch_kazatel: I was just considering doing something with pictures, and was considering load times, and I realized that I have to scale the images server side and sew them together in some relevant way before I send them, otherwise the bandwidth for loading like 100+ images will be insane - I should've stated this outright, but I meant like 100 full sized images as little tiny like square tiles for a background
[18:10:55] <user_student> Does the future jquery will still be necessary? :)
[18:11:05] <duch_kazatel> user_student what?
[18:11:11] <suyase> duch_kazatel: I was going to strip photos from coworkers facebooks and basically just display them as a collage in the shape of a coworker's silhouette
[18:11:44] <suyase> but I realize the photos need to be processed server side or the loading times will be insane
[18:11:47] <user_student> in the*
[18:11:59] <duch_kazatel> user_student huh?
[18:12:15] <duch_kazatel> suyase that's going to require server-side image processing for the silhouette, but pulling the images from facebook should be OK depending on size.
[18:12:19] <duch_kazatel> they shouldn't be too huge.
[18:13:07] <mvpgraff> LinsdayMac: I just realized you were using a upload thing
[18:13:13] <CorySimmons> Anyone know why this iframe href event isn't working? The yellow link should take you to codepen.io in the main viewport (not the iframe): http://codepen.io/corysimmons/pen/yAzon
[18:13:14] <mvpgraff> nvm, yes please validate
[18:13:15] <mvpgraff> :D
[18:13:45] <user_student> well, the html5 not necessarily need the jquery
[18:14:01] <duch_kazatel> user_student why not?
[18:14:14] <suyase> duch_kazatel: Cool
[18:14:17] <suyase> duch_kazatel: Thanks =D
[18:14:22] <duch_kazatel> suyase my pleasure.
[18:14:29] <suyase> duch_kazatel: I'm going to get out of IRC and focus - thanks for all the help =D
[18:14:31] <duch_kazatel> user_student HTML5 is all about HTML, not about javascript, though it does bring about some APIs that you can use in javascript.
[18:14:52] <duch_kazatel> jquery's going to have a place for a long time because of stuff like it's selector engine and easy animations.
[18:14:55] <duch_kazatel> simple ajax.
[18:14:55] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[18:15:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> duch_kazatel: dont forget backwards compatibility
[18:15:40] <user_student> easy animations = css3
[18:15:43] <duch_kazatel> that's another good point.
[18:15:50] <duch_kazatel> and user_student not as easy as jquery.
[18:15:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> user_student: css3 not avaible on older browsers
[18:16:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *available
[18:17:32] <user_student> Yeah, but I said "in the future" jquery " may not be necessary
[18:17:45] <duch_kazatel> in the future jquery will still have a place.
[18:18:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> its got so much to offer as duch_kazatel mentioned before
[18:18:13] <user_student> in the future ie8- die
[18:18:27] <duch_kazatel> $('#wrap').on('click', 'a.pagination', function(){ /* magic here */})
[18:18:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> duch_kazatel: i think user_student is looking from the point of view that more and more browsers will become modern and alot more features that were once done in jquery will now be done in css
[18:19:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> duch_kazatel: im pretty sure css4 can handle events now
[18:19:06] <duch_kazatel> sure - that snippet i just posted is a great example of why jquery will still be around.
[18:19:12] <user_student> yeha
[18:19:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> thought its primitive
[18:19:14] <user_student> yeah
[18:19:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> user_student: ie8 will take a bit of time to die....remember there are still users using win XP
[18:20:18] <duch_kazatel> and that's irrelevant - jquery provides syntactic sugar that enable quick and dirty handling of event delegation.
[18:20:24] <duch_kazatel> *enables
[18:20:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[18:20:33] <duch_kazatel> it also normalizes accross browsers
[18:20:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> have you seen css4 though?
[18:20:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/general/css4-is-coming-what-you-need-to-know/
[18:20:59] <duch_kazatel> ... you do see what date that was published on, right?
[18:21:28] <duch_kazatel> Rohan_Bhangui that was a joke - april fools
[18:21:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[18:21:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[18:21:39] <pixelpimp> we should really be getting away from these css3/css4 terms anyway
[18:21:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> didnt see that until now
[18:22:15] <duch_kazatel> either way, I need to head home.  enjoy yourselves.
[18:22:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:23:01] <pixelpimp> lol @ font-style: wordart
[18:23:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: same concept as usb
[18:25:04] <terinjokes> pixelpimp: i actually just rololed at that
[18:28:27] <funhouse> Hi there, question about the jquery ui spinner, Im just wondering why it is when I step up, it uses the increment of the 'step' option, but when in step down, it uses the value of the 'min' option. Shouldn't it just be using the 'step' option regardless of up or down?
[18:28:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:00:02] <funhouse> Hi there, question about the jquery ui spinner, Im just wondering why it is when I step up, it uses the increment of the 'step' option, but when in step down, it uses the value of the 'min' option. Shouldn't it just be using the 'step' option regardless of up or down?
[19:00:39] <funhouse> I am getting value as null sometimes when I clearly set it wit a valid number.
[19:02:30] <resting> is there any difference between using $.post().success() vs $.post().done() ?
[19:03:16] <resting> hm..well..just googled for my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8840257/jquery-ajax-handling-continue-responses-success-vs-done
[19:03:25] <sayakb> hi guys, is there a way to see if a text within an element is selected (as in highlighted)
[19:07:43] <i8igmac> Rohan_Bhangui: hi
[19:08:17] <Gowie> Somebody mind helping me out with a CORS issue? It seems my request is fine when its not wrapped in a closure, but blows up with CORS errors when inside...  https://gist.github.com/Gowiem/6788056
[19:08:38] <i8igmac> my scrolle back history wont show my last message
[19:14:13] <Fenikkusu> I'm paging through an array. This is easy enough. I wondering if anyone has suggestions on how I might track selected items in this array? Using the index?
[19:15:51] <funhouse> Oh I see -->http://iwl.com/forum/582-possible-flaw-in-jquery-ui-spinner-widget-version-1-10-3
[19:16:00] <funhouse> jqueryui devs too lazy to add info.
[19:19:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: hey wut?
[19:28:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: whats the issue
[19:34:27] <i8igmac> im trying to load several hundred trailers on one page and i would like to lighten up the load time
[19:34:42] <i8igmac> src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax......js
[19:35:01] <i8igmac> if that line repeats it self will that delay laod time?
[19:36:11] <i8igmac> Oh never mind... exactly my problem
[19:39:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[19:39:16] <Gowie> Somebody mind helping me out with a CORS issue? It seems my request is fine when its not wrapped in a closure, but blows up with CORS errors when inside...  https://gist.github.com/Gowiem/6788056
[19:39:40] <suyase> Okay, I'm officially en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect there on jquery
[19:39:49] <suyase> which is progress from knowing nothing.
[19:40:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: did you answer your own question or still need assistnce
[19:40:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> what i would do
[19:40:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> isload three iamges
[19:40:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> set to display none
[19:40:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then fade in
[19:40:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> when all three in the same row are ready
[19:47:51] <funhouse> does anyone have experience with jqueryui spinner?
[20:06:16] <knat> Can anyone suggest a good tutorial for writing ujs with jquery?
[20:07:03] <Hrumph> hi
[20:07:16] <Hrumph> $( "#accordion" ).accordion();
[20:07:18] <Hrumph>        $("#accordion").accordion("option","heightStyle","content");
[20:07:22] <Hrumph> is the second line of code correct?
[20:07:42] <Hrumph> i want to set an option for the widget i made. it has an "id" of accordion
[20:09:33] <Hrumph> i'm not getting the heightstyle to behave the way i think it should
[21:17:00] <jned> I have $("#fileSelect").click(function(e){ in my script, but the #fileSelect element isn't in the dom on page load, instead it is added later using append and so the .click event isn't working, and tried changing it to .on or .live but it didn't work, what am I doing wrong"?
[21:29:07] <mfrias> jned As far as I know the on method is for delegation, that said, you shoudl assign the on method to a parent element, listening for the #fileSelect
[21:29:35] <jned> mfrias, oh I see, thanks
[21:46:01] <suyase> Someone quick please save me!
[21:46:58] <suyase> I just finished all of the codeschool CSS, Jquery, javascript, and HTML course materials, and I need to know:  What IDE can I use that will provide highlighting and side-by-side viewing of CSS, jquery, HTML, and the rendered page?
[21:52:21] <mfrias> suyase, I would recomend Sublime Text
[21:52:35] <mfrias> suyase, http://www.sublimetext.com/
[21:52:37] <suyase> mfrias: I use it for python, but I feel it is inappropriate here
[21:53:10] <suyase> mfrias: I'm looking at google developer tools
[21:53:17] <mfrias> suyase, For HTML, CSS & Javascript I think it is the best
[21:53:29] <suyase> mfrias: but, does it render pages?
[21:53:39] <mfrias> suyase, Yep, you can also use WebDeveloper Tools
[21:54:49] <mfrias> suyase, So you are looking into two different things. 1.- CodeEditor like sublime, but maybe you're a looking for an IDE or WYSIWYG code editor like the old Dreamweaver
[21:55:17] <suyase> mfrias: er
[21:55:32] <suyase> mfrias: I'm sure a single IDE can provide every feature I need
[21:56:38] <mfrias> suyase, the only IDE with the capabilities you require that I know it is Dreamweaver
[21:57:06] <mfrias> suyase, But you can use Chrome developer tools. I think there is a code school screencast from Paul Irish
[21:57:43] <suyase> mfrias: I found like seven of them already
[21:58:07] <suyase> mfrias: all of them support building
[21:58:16] <suyase> mfrias: there's even an eclipse plugin for it
[21:58:48] <suyase> mfrias: I just thought there might be one that is more preferred - I mean, these are all awesome, but I'd imagine one rises to the top
[21:59:05] <mfrias> I don't have to much experience with IDE's just with netbeans, dreamweaver and visual studio
[22:00:32] <suyase> mfrias: I've really only used sublime, eclipse, visual studio, and some other cheesy ones
[22:01:13] <suyase> anyway, thanks for the help!
[22:01:16] <suyase> I have to get back to work
[22:37:45] <thom_> i have a quesiton... i am submitting a  form
[22:38:03] <thom_> with jquery and then that happens in a loop but it seems though my loop is working
[22:38:18] <thom_> does submit take to long
[22:38:33] <thom_> because  my loop iterates 3 times
[22:38:36] <thom_>  i know thats working fine
[22:38:41] <thom_> and submit always gives me the last one
[22:38:44] <thom_>  thats it
[22:39:04] <fat_> Cork: im trying to generate individual ID's with php for my jquery, but the button action is not triggering. Do you know why ? http://pastebin.com/w6pPH83G
[22:39:42] <jphase> thom_: what do you mean submit? like submitting forms multiple times?
[22:39:49] <jphase> thom_: or ajax submit?
[22:40:12] <thom_> $form[0].submit()
[22:40:26] <thom_> or form.get(0).submit()
[22:40:33] <thom_> in a loop
[22:40:42] <jphase> thom_: submitting a form should take you off of the page though, yeah?
[22:40:54] <thom_> hmmmm... thats a good point
[22:40:58] <thom_> thats simple logic
[22:41:12] <jphase> you could change that to ajax and wouldn't have to worry about that though
[22:42:01] <thom_> no and that s simple... the problem is im building a drupal module.. but im either goign to rewrite the way i do this... or write my site from scratch with my own cms
[22:42:45] <thom_> actually maybe i can avoid all that
[22:42:49] <thom_> let me think
[22:42:54] <jphase> what's the task at hand?
[22:43:00] <thom_> do you know drupal
[22:43:02] <jphase> yes
[22:43:10] <thom_> im writing a commerce multivendor stripe module
[22:43:28] <thom_> eveentually for contrib but right now im just trying to get my store off the ground
[22:43:39] <thom_> and im basically just using 2 apis that may not like eachother
[22:43:43] <thom_> everything is working fine
[22:43:51] <thom_> and my logic is sound i had it confirmed with stripe employees
[22:43:56] <thom_> on my solution to incorporate connect
[22:44:08] <thom_> which is what stripe built for multivendor
[22:44:16] <jphase> do you know their API conflicts or are you anticipating forwards-compatibility?
[22:44:39] <thom_> no i didn't know their api conflicts i did read that some webhooks delay
[22:44:46] <thom_> but i am not building customers anymore
[22:44:49] <thom_> which is a web hook
[22:45:04] <thom_> iam just creating a new access_token on each line item
[22:45:09] <thom_> and then posting that to the form
[22:45:44] <jphase> okay, and what's the jQuery problem again?
[22:45:50] <thom_> but what i did was not think because $form.get(0).submit was the code  suggestion from somewhere else i read in research and i didnt' think about whats actually happeneing
[22:46:14] <jphase> well that just grabs the first form and submits it
[22:46:21] <jphase> assuming $form is selected correctly
[22:46:28] <thom_> your right
[22:46:30] <thom_> it does
[22:46:42] <thom_> because it works but only onc
[22:46:48] <thom_> 'of course
[22:46:49] <thom_> '
[22:47:07] <jphase> you could ajaxify your forms and submit them in succession with deferred events
[22:47:31] <thom_> let me try this with a ajax... and see if the post hits the ajax form that way
[22:47:36] <jphase> but traditionally I'm only accustomed to being able to submit forms the old fashioned way once
[22:47:46] <jphase> k
[22:47:55] <thom_> its been a while since ihave really dug into code cuz i am a sales manager at  astore
[22:48:03] <thom_> but im trying to work for my self
[22:48:17] <jphase> if you want a simple method for that to save you time...  I made an AJAXify method for this o_o
[22:48:19] <jphase> https://gist.github.com/jphase/6771193
[22:48:40] <jphase> takes regular form and makes it AJAX, just in case you were too lazy to change hehe
[22:49:01] <thom_> no i havent done this in a while but i have done it multiple times over
[22:49:15] <jphase> k
[22:49:20] <thom_> thanks though
[22:55:18] <fourlincoln10> I need to retrieve some data from a click event when a user clicks a bar in a bar chart then post the data to my server and navigate to the url I post to. Is the best way to do that to dynamically create a form element and submit the form?
[22:56:59] <jphase> fourlincoln10: I'd say ajax would be the best way personally
[22:57:52] <fourlincoln10> How would you do that using ajax? My hang up is posting and navigating to the same url
[22:59:14] <jphase> fourlincoln10: Anything that can be done with regular forms can be done with ajax if done correctly, shy of some odd redirect issues that __machine has with CORS haha (sorry bro, had to)
[22:59:41] <jphase> fourlincoln10: based on what your server responds with, you can do any operation that's possible in JS
[23:00:33] <jphase> oh, navigating to another URL on form submit would be a good use for regular forms too though I suppose
[23:00:59] <jphase> you can just set the action to that URL if you actually just need to forward to the URL you're posting to at the same time
[23:01:20] <fourlincoln10> Kinda what I thought...thanks.
[23:02:11] <sayd> any reason i couldnt do a $.get in a click handler?
[23:02:47] <sayd> i see the request happening and im getting a response from the server but my success function (3rd arg to get) never fires
[23:03:49] <jphase> sayd: result is probably not in the data type you specified
[23:03:58] <jphase> try adding a .error function on there to see the error
[23:04:07] <jphase> or .fail rather
[23:04:09] <jphase> that's the new one
[23:04:38] <thom_> okay solution that doesn't require me to write this site from scratch...
[23:04:49] <thom_> instead of ajaxing theform one iteration at  atime
[23:05:18] <sayd> ah nice
[23:05:23] <sayd> Invalid XML: true
[23:05:28] <sayd> thanks jphase
[23:05:32] <jphase> np
[23:05:34] <sayd> i will use getJSON insttead
[23:05:49] <jphase> thom_: I guess I just don't understand how you can submit 3 forms the old fashioned way back to back unless you did a weird work around like javascript submits on page load based on GET vars or something hackish
[23:06:39] <jphase> won't it just send you to the location of your form action, and thus reloading the DOM to that new page?
[23:07:49] <thom_> im not going to submit it 3 times
[23:08:34] <thom_> im goign to submit it once and each value will be attached to a name_indexNumber
[23:08:44] <jphase> oh okay
[23:08:58] * jphase misunderstood
[23:09:07] <thom_> im exhausted andhave to get up soon to run a store but i will do this tommroow i really should go to sleep
[23:09:08] <jphase> so it's only attaching the last value?
[23:09:14] <thom_> ?
[23:09:16] <jphase> k
[23:09:18] <jphase> ciao
[23:10:14] <Cork> jphase: heh, that made me flinch... :)
[23:10:42] <Cork> jphase: "ciao" is a common first word for irc downloaders...
[23:10:47] <Cork> followed by !list >_>
[23:10:54] <jphase> oh, hah
[23:10:58] <Cork> i've been fiddleing with those too much >_<
[23:11:41] * Cork /b was half typed when i saw it XD
[23:12:00] <Cork> guess that is what they call conditioned response...
[23:12:45] <jphase> oh snap, didn't know I was that close
[23:12:58] <Cork> lol, no i don't have op here :)
[23:13:00] <jphase> is that like for dcc downloaders?
[23:13:01] <jphase> oh haha
[23:13:03] <jphase> right
[23:13:07] <Cork> and that makes it even funnier :)
[23:13:13] <Cork> ya
[23:13:24] <__machine> jphase: i tried using a proxy on the frontend server for my cors requests... i get the 302 back but there are still problems with the redirect because the location header points to a different domain... either it wont allow, or it returns a response telling me to reload the page to view the content... i might have to just give up the redirect thing :)
[23:13:45] <Cork> those downloaders has an ui for the servers, so they don't see the channel, so you can't talk with them...
[23:14:09] <Ububegin> i receive data from getJson.success(function(data)) method.. how do I store this data variable.. so that it remains available for all other jquery method calls.. OR how to store this as global
[23:14:09] <jphase> __machine: that's a hard thing to try to form a sentence for Google too... each time I try to help you all the links I'm clicking on have already been visited or are irrelevant
[23:14:46] <jphase> Ububegin: you can declare a global variable and then set it on your response
[23:15:38] <jphase> just put the var outside of any function scope
[23:16:10] <__machine> jphase: unless i got my proxy to alter the location header so that it is also proxied... :D
[23:16:24] <jphase> __machine: hmm, doesn't YUI do that stuff for you?
[23:17:23] <Ububegin> jphase: thanks.. followed this example.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6180077/jquery-save-local-variable-for-use-later-on-in-the-code
[23:17:56] <jphase> exactly Ububegin :)
[23:19:55] <__machine> jphase:  i dont think the YUI php proxy example does anything tricky... i wonder if i can rewrite the location header in responses to proxy requests with mod_rewrite
[23:23:29] <MrS1lentcz> hello, is anyone using datepicker plugin? is it stable plugin seriously? i was set "onChange" option and it does not work, any hints, please?
[23:24:06] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: datepicker works great typically, do you have a sample of your code?
[23:25:08] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: http://pastebin.com/5PHPDVa7
[23:26:14] <Hrumph> i put a definition list in a two column div
[23:26:35] <Hrumph> i don't want any definitions to be split accross the columns
[23:26:42] <Hrumph> is there anyway to make sure that can't happen
[23:26:49] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: I think you're looking for onSelect not onChange
[23:26:57] <jphase> oh nvm
[23:27:00] <jphase> that's in your code
[23:27:14] <boytoy> At this planned dropdown menu: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/45/embedded/result/ -- would you guys have done steps 1-6 any differently?
[23:27:16] <jphase> is your console not saying "here" ?
[23:27:17] <boytoy> Gonna start coding this when I wake up, just curious if I should make any last minute change of plans.
[23:28:26] <boytoy> :D
[23:28:30] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: sorry, i have repaired now, but it still does not work
[23:28:43] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: do you see your message in your console?
[23:28:57] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: yeah, allways, no message i have
[23:29:31] <jphase> boytoy: sounds good. Out of curiosity, did you already look into masonry and packery for creating columns based on vertical height?
[23:30:41] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: any errors in your console?
[23:30:48] <boytoy> jphase: Excellent!
[23:30:57] <boytoy> jphase: masonry or packery for this menu thing?!
[23:31:13] <jphase> boytoy: perhaps, depends on what they have to create columns based on height
[23:31:13] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: only uncaught exception of prettyPhoto plugin...
[23:31:19] <boytoy> wow.. that is one *crazY* idea =)
[23:32:40] <boytoy> yeah im using packery for photos and videos on my site.. never in my wildest dreams thought of using it for this menu though
[23:33:02] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: i have rendered calendar in html block pernamently, is that problem ?
[23:33:37] <boytoy> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dK5Us/17/ :p
[23:33:57] <jphase> boytoy: doesn't look like masonry does much based on the height in their options
[23:34:01] <jphase> :\
[23:34:13] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: your code looks fine for the most part, try resolving your prettyPhoto error
[23:34:42] <jphase> or disable that plugin for a second to see if that's not the case (assuming you're using WP prettyPhoto)
[23:35:24] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: i have interest error. in plugin prettyPhoto it reports prettyPhoto object has no method prettyPhoto :)
[23:36:11] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: are you including jQuery twice by chance?
[23:37:03] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: yeah, i have the same as in html template by coder..
[23:37:37] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: and there is not any error :/
[23:37:54] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: usually 'has no method prettyPhoto' will mean you included jQuery manually on top of WordPress' version of jQuery
[23:38:11] <jphase> thus making every extension of jQuery break
[23:38:41] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: view your source and see if you have 2 jQuery libraries included
[23:38:54] <glosoli> Anyone had problems with jQuery getting only file name from the input file field /
[23:38:55] <glosoli> ?
[23:39:01] <jphase> ohhhh
[23:39:04] <jphase> you're also in wordpress
[23:39:06] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: http://sportonline.fixart.cz/
[23:39:46] <jphase> MrS1lentcz: you using that code of yours inside a noConflict wrapper?    jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[23:40:08] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: yeah
[23:40:13] <Cork> jphase: that isn't a noconflict wrapper
[23:40:34] <martenbrosch> good morning!
[23:40:37] <jphase> whoops, noConflict-friendly
[23:40:48] <jphase> conflict wrapper
[23:41:17] <jphase> I always call that wrapper noConflict because the wrapper itself doesn't cause conflicts with anything it's used in, always mix that up
[23:41:39] <Cork> jphase: well it isn't enough if you load two versions of jquery
[23:41:58] <Cork> it is not a big change needed though
[23:42:02] <jphase> I know that part, but the page he linked to has no errors like that
[23:42:19] <jphase> his prettyPhoto errors aren't on this page :\
[23:42:26] <jphase> no errors in console actually
[23:43:08] <MrS1lentcz> jphase: i know
[23:43:13] <jphase> there is an error on his popup though :\   MrS1lentcz where is this datepicker suppose to be? in the calendar?
[23:43:58] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: what triggers the error?
[23:45:33] <jphase> I see an error on when you click on a calendar date trying to get innerHTML of null in popup.js line 202, not sure if that's related
[23:45:39] <ripthejacker> how can I swap two columns in a table its entirety using jquery?
[23:46:22] <ripthejacker> how can I swap two columns in a table in its entirety using jquery?*
[23:46:53] <Cork> ripthejacker: so you want to move two td elements on each tr in a table?
[23:46:54] <jphase> don't know of a native way to swap elements in jQuery
[23:47:05] <Cork> well... you would have to do just that
[23:47:50] <jphase> oh you could just grab one and move insertBefore the other if it's tds yeah?
[23:47:52] <ripthejacker> Cork: td, th with all the ids and classes and stuff.
[23:47:58] <jphase> -move
[23:48:03] <jphase> oh, th
[23:48:12] <Cork> $('table tr').each(function() { var cols = $(this).find('td'); cols.eq(4).before(cols.eq(5)); });
[23:48:33] <Cork> ripthejacker: you could use the class instead of the eq()
[23:49:04] <Cork> $('table tr').each(function() { var cols = $(this).find('td'); cols.filter('.class1').before(cols.filter('.class2')); });
[23:49:16] <Cork> oh, th
[23:49:18] <jphase> yeah
[23:49:20] <Cork> $('table tr').each(function() { var cols = $(this).find('td, th'); cols.filter('.class1').before(cols.filter('.class2')); });
[23:49:21] <jphase> need index too ?
[23:49:28] <Cork> no
[23:49:29] <ripthejacker> Cork: is there any way using insert after or something?
[23:49:39] <Cork> ripthejacker: it does
[23:49:42] <Cork> before <--
[23:49:57] <Cork> but ya after would work too
[23:50:13] <Cork> would have to switch the classes in the filters though
[23:50:35] <jphase> I guess I was thinking th columns from the thead area
[23:50:51] <Cork> jphase: this one handles the entire table
[23:50:56] <jphase> oh right, with classnames
[23:50:59] <Cork> thead, tbody and tfoot
[23:51:20] <Cork> jphase: the first example builds it on the column position
[23:51:39] <ripthejacker> Cork: I don't have to hide any colums?
[23:51:44] <Cork> no
[23:51:59] <Cork> ripthejacker: a dom element can only exist in one place
[23:52:05] <ripthejacker> Cork: thanks friend
[23:52:15] <Cork> so when you insert it on a new position, it is moved there
[23:52:29] <ripthejacker> yeah gotit :)
