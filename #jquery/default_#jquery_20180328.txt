[08:31:54] <fas3r> Hello
[08:35:19] <fas3r> if I define variables in a function/plugin which is accessible like : this.myVar from inside the plugin/function. Can I prevent the user to access variables for example starting with a _ ( like this._myVar)  in the same way that I could check if the user is calling a method starting with a _ ?
[08:37:03] <MikeD_> fas3r: no, the underscore is a convention but not enforced
[08:38:30] <fas3r> MikeD_: is there a way to achieve some enforcement on variable level ? ( if I can say it like that)
[08:39:44] <MikeD_> first i would ask what it is you are trying to prevent the user from accessing
[08:41:23] <fas3r> MikeD_: nothing in particular, just curious.
[08:41:51] <MikeD_> if you publish a decent set of methods, nobody is going to use your "private" properties.  If you are trying to prevent a hostile actor from wrecking your single-page app, i'm confident 1) nobody cares 2) anyone who cares probably knows enough to inspect your object no matter how you build it - the whole source is public
[08:42:26] <MikeD_> there are ways to declare local variables and create the functions as closures over the scope of those variables, but imo it's annoying for too little actual value
[08:43:32] <MikeD_> it is also possible to define the property as non-enumerable, so realistically nobody sees them upon casual inspection ... but your app can continue to reference the property
[08:43:48] <pavonia> And you can't use them in prototype functions, which is the most annoying part, IMHO
[08:46:09] <fas3r> ok I see that you mean
[08:46:37] <fas3r> thanks for the explanation.
[09:33:12] <TitaniumLeg> If anyone has a moment, please take a look at my question here:https://stackoverflow.com/q/48755763/7668467
[09:33:58] <TitaniumLeg> Has to do with select2 in a modal on Firefox. Known issue, but none of the know solutions are working for me. May be because my modal also requires scroll.

[10:36:07] <mrclue> How to check these with add toLowerCase() ; ---> https://jsfiddle.net/r8mjvgoa/55/
[10:41:19] <fas3r> mrclue: just assign a class
[10:41:48] <fas3r> and use css directly. no need to use jquery for that.
[10:45:56] <mrclue> fas3r: how do you mean?
[10:46:15] <mrclue> I need to check if text contain same text before adding something
[11:51:28] <preference> hello. i have a table with two columns. the first column doesn't matter, however various rows in the second column have important information. i have given a unique id to each cell in the table which has the important information. however, i can't show the table. i must instead pull the important text in the cells with IDs and place it inside a <div>.
[11:51:36] <preference> how can this be done?
[11:52:45] <preference> if this needs to be made simpler: how can i put text from somewhere else between <div></div>? i'm not very good with jquery but i have to use it.
[11:55:17] <taplar> 'some where else between divs'?
[11:55:36] <preference> from somewhere else, between <div></div>
[11:55:55] <taplar> the 'some where else' is throwing me off.  specifically, where are you trying to get the data from
[11:56:16] <taplar> <div>this stuff</div> ?
[11:56:28] <preference> so i have <td id="foobar">hello world!</td>, and i want to put the "hello world!" into a <div></div>
[11:56:39] <taplar> so that's the text() or html() of that element
[11:56:52] <taplar> $('#foobar').text()
[11:57:32] <preference> so simply document load -> div id.text = foobar.text? something like that?
[11:57:37] <preference> (roughly)
[11:58:13] <taplar> $(selectorForDiv).text($(selectorForTd).text())
[11:58:36] <taplar> text() is a getter.  text(value) is a setter
[11:58:39] <preference> i don't really understand selectors =/
[11:58:51] <taplar> are you familiar with css selectors?
[11:59:04] <preference> no, i've looked at the doc and i don't really understand them
[11:59:19] <taplar> i would highly suggest you become familiar with them
[11:59:28] <taplar> but just a short list
[11:59:32] <preference> is it just a generic term for using an id or something?
[11:59:39] <taplar> 'thing' <- searches for a tag name
[11:59:47] <taplar> '#thing' <- searches for an id
[11:59:54] <taplar> '.thing' <- searches for a class
[11:59:57] <preference> yeah
[12:00:00] <preference> i've done little things like that
[12:00:06] <taplar> those are selectors
[12:00:13] <preference> so is selectorForDiv just a placeholder for the name or class or something?
[12:00:19] <taplar> yup
[12:00:25] <preference> that explains a lot
[12:00:51] <taplar> since i don't know what specifically you name stuff, but I wan't to convey the concept, :)
[12:00:53] <preference> so when you say $(selectorForTd) you would mean "#foobar" if that's the id?
[12:00:58] <taplar> yes
[12:01:09] <preference> thank you so much, very very helpful
[12:01:33] <preference> and one last question, back to my original question: in jquery you don't use = to change a value, you just use ()?
[12:01:46] <taplar> correct
[12:01:55] <preference> <3
[12:02:02] <taplar> since elements are wrapped in a jQuery object, properties on them are not directly exposed
[12:02:08] <taplar> so you have to use their methods to change things
[12:02:26] <preference> great
[12:02:30] <preference> i'll try that now, thanks again :)
[12:02:47] <taplar> however, if you -want- to, you could always use the = if you broke out of the jQuery object
[12:03:03] <preference> no point breaking convention for no reason
[12:03:08] <taplar> :)
[12:05:01] <preference> ok, so i've tested it, and this will only replace the id of the specific thing that i've created. so if i have <td id="foo">, <div id="bar">, then this will replace it fine
[12:05:40] <preference> but what if i just named each <td> and <div> the same id? or should that be a class, because you should only ever use a unique ID for 1 element on the page?
[12:06:01] <taplar> right, you'd want to use a class, or a data element or something.  you wouldn't duplicate ids
[12:06:17] <taplar> personally i'd probably use a data element to identify where it should go
[12:06:32] <preference> i don't know what a data element in this context would be
[12:06:57] <preference> bear in mind this code will only need to be used in one page and one place, so it doesn't need to be super abstracted
[12:07:08] <taplar> <td class="moveToDiv" data-target="myFirstDiv">Stuff 1</td>  <div class="myFirstDiv"></div>
[12:07:26] <preference> but i have a whole array of things i need to move
[12:08:01] <preference> it's something like this: <td class=foo1><td class=foo2>... <div class=foo1><div class=foo2>
[12:08:12] <preference> (not actually an array, just a table heh)
[12:08:16] <taplar> $('.moveToDiv').each(function(){ var $td = $(this);  $('.'+ $td.data('target')).text(this.innerHTML); });
[12:08:50] <taplar> ^ that would find all the elements with a class of 'moveToDiv', and for each of them, find the element that has a class matching their data-target, and set their text and the td's inner html
[12:08:55] <preference> that looks great
[12:09:23] <taplar> so all the code knows is there are elements with a class and a target, that references other classes.
[12:09:26] <preference> so to clarify: give each <td> a class="foo", and then the target would be the class of the <div> i'm moving it to? and that would be
[12:09:29] <taplar> it's up to you put out them on the right elements, :)
[12:09:38] <preference> - and that would be
[12:09:54] <preference> does data-target work only on classes or does it work on id?
[12:10:02] <taplar> it can be anything that you want it to be
[12:10:23] <taplar> if you made it an id, you'd change that each() logic to use '#' rather than '.'
[12:10:51] <preference> will try it, thanks :)
[12:13:48] <preference> is data-target native HTML?
[12:14:40] <taplar> it is a native html way of providing data to elements as non-standard attributes
[12:15:00] <taplar> data-* can be anything you need
[12:15:14] <taplar> so say you had a table of contact information or something
[12:15:19] <preference> ah, so it's this
[12:15:20] <preference> https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp
[12:15:38] <taplar> rather than having hidden fields to store data, you could do like <tr data-firstName="me" data-lastName="you">
[12:16:05] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*
[12:16:33] <preference> thanks :)
[12:23:44] <preference> that doesn't seem to have worked @taplar, but i'll for sure have a more indepth look at it tomorrow and sort it out. thanks again! :)
[12:23:58] <taplar> can you share what you tried?
[12:24:40] <preference> <td style="width: 69.0797%;" class="moveToDiv" data-target="foobar1">foobar1text</td>
[12:24:53] <preference> <div style="max-height: 200px;" class="foobar1"></div>
[12:25:06] <preference> $( document ).ready();   $('.moveToDiv').each(function(){ var $td = $(this);        $('.'+ $td.data('target')).text(this.innerHTML);         }); });
[12:26:25] <preference> the weird width on the table is because this isn't for me to handle, i'm having to make a table in a GUI so that the final user will be able to easily edit the important text
[12:26:28] <preference> it's a bit of a nightmare :)
[12:26:52] <taplar> is your table built dynamically?  because your document ready there isn't doing anything
[12:26:57] <taplar> your stuff is outside of the ready
[12:27:14] <preference> i don't know what you mean by that, but i can for sure take it out
[12:27:20] <preference> owl-carousel seems to work without it, so will give it a shot
[12:27:45] <preference> oh shit, that did it
[12:27:50] <preference> thanks!!!!
[12:27:56] <preference> why did it make a difference, though?
[12:28:13] <taplar> when you do a $(selector) is looks for matches in the DOM
[12:28:41] <taplar> if the elements do not exist yet in the DOM, such as they are defined further down in the page, they will not exist in the DOM yet
[12:29:13] <taplar> $(document).ready() delays the execution of the logic you give it until the document has been parsed into the DOM entirely
[12:30:07] <preference> i don't think i understand the DOM very well at all :P
[12:30:26] <taplar> are you familiar with tree structures?
[12:30:28] <preference> i thought that was just the browser's interpretation of the page's code
[12:30:33] <taplar> yes
[12:30:49] <taplar> it is also where javascript looks for elements
[12:30:57] <taplar> and is how it manipulates existing elements
[12:31:29] <preference> but wouldn't code executed after the DOM is "ready" apply to everything in the DOM, including the table?
[12:31:46] <preference> i mean, the elements would exist in the DOM after the DOM says it's ready, right?
[12:31:49] <taplar> yes
[12:32:24] <preference> so then $(document).ready() would surely ensure that the table has actually been created, right? i don't see why it changes anything
[12:32:40] <taplar> $(document).ready() is not a blocking method
[12:32:49] <taplar> meaning code after it will not wait to execute.
[12:33:03] <taplar> which is why you have to do $(document).ready(function(){ ...stuff... });
[12:33:17] <taplar> the function you give it you are saying, hey, once it's ready, run this
[12:33:55] <preference> but why don't i want the script to run once the document says it's ready?
[12:34:15] <taplar> you -do- want it to run once it's ready, which is why you have to document ready
[12:34:19] <preference> no
[12:34:25] <preference> i took out the document ready entirely
[12:34:26] <taplar> ?
[12:34:27] <preference> and that's when it worked
[12:34:30] <taplar> oh
[12:34:40] <taplar> no clue then, :)  unless it was a parse error
[12:34:46] <preference> now it's just
[12:34:47] <preference>   $('.moveToDiv').each(function(){ var $td = $(this);        $('.'+ $td.data('target')).text(this.innerHTML);         });
[12:34:49] <taplar> because $(document).ready() technically isn't valid
[12:35:03] <preference> does it need ready(function()( or something?
[12:35:14] <taplar> if you do a ready(), yes, it needs a function
[12:35:20] <preference> gotcha :)
[12:35:40] <robertmaxrees> or $(function() { /* your code here */ }); - shorthand version :)
[12:35:47] <taplar> yes
[12:35:50] <taplar> ah crap, lol
[12:35:55] <preference> that's all i needed help with for now. thank you again so much, you saved me a good week or so of time
[12:36:26] <preference> cheers robertmaxrees, i'll use that in the future :)
[12:36:29] <preference> see ya around ^^
[12:40:31] <taplar> robert!  i got my fk setup done, :D

[12:41:29] <taplar> builds with webpack, vue, makes the service work, all the shabang.  even has a dummy server for testing
[12:42:22] <taplar> still needs some tweaks like an npm script for watching for changes, or that may be a webpack setting too, but i really like it, :)

[13:50:03] <zoopla> Hi all, any ideas why this doesn't work in IE? https://i.imgur.com/zN0hjmc.png
[13:50:17] <zoopla> The click isn't getting registered at all
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically adding the elements for those handlers?
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> *that those handlers bind to
[13:51:29] <zoopla> No
[13:52:05] <robertmaxrees> is that code in a document ready?
[13:52:43] <zoopla> Yes
[13:52:45] <robertmaxrees> hard to know what the issue is wtih the screenshot.
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[13:52:59] <zoopla> It worked in the fiddle...
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> any errors in your console on your site?
[13:53:14] <robertmaxrees> even if they seem unrelated.
[13:53:29] <zoopla> Yes, but they are unrelated
[13:53:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:53:47] <zoopla> Here is the fiddle that works... https://jsfiddle.net/yq6z15zk/3/
[13:53:56] <robertmaxrees> they might be causing the rest of the JS to break.
[13:54:32] <robertmaxrees> i might fix those up and see what happens.
[13:56:56] <zoopla> ugh i hate my job hahahah
[13:57:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> was that the issue?
[13:58:11] <zoopla> The error is in a script that is being pulled in
[13:58:15] <zoopla> there is nothing i can do about it
[13:58:21] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[13:58:34] <zoopla> SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'includes'
[13:58:54] <robertmaxrees> try commenting that inclue out.
[13:58:56] <robertmaxrees> *include
[13:59:51] <zoopla> I cannot
[13:59:59] <zoopla> It is a linked script
[14:00:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:01:45] <zoopla> I can't even unlink it for now because this CMS sucks
[14:02:09] <robertmaxrees> do you only get that error in IE?
[14:02:19] <zoopla> Yeah
[14:02:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a pretty good candidate for your error.
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> *problem, w/e
[14:02:41] <zoopla> Of course all the directors are using IE and refuse to upgrade so they are convinced the website doesn't work at all
[14:02:50] <robertmaxrees> which version of IE?
[14:03:09] <zoopla> i'm not sure but the onclick doesn't work in 11 so i assume it doesn't work in any
[14:38:24] <zoopla> I still need help guys
