[15:23:57] <biffco> guys how can i check if a table row has a .visibility css attr?
[15:24:11] <robertmaxrees> .hasClass('.visibility') ?
[15:24:26] <biffco> so its defined in tr tag as style="visibility: collapse;"
[15:24:37] <biffco> robertmaxres it gives false
[15:24:44] <robertmaxrees> lol.
[15:24:50] <biffco> ye...im saying the same
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> .visibility implies you want a css class.
[15:25:09] <biffco> anyway i want to check this attr
[15:25:13] <biffco> if its exists
[15:25:31] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:25:38] <robertmaxrees> you can only get back the current value.
[15:25:43] <robertmaxrees> not "whether or not its set"
[15:25:52] <biffco> i did something like this, console.log ($("#"+id+'View').has("visibility"));
[15:26:04] <biffco> jsut for check
[15:26:04] <robertmaxrees> and??
[15:26:07] <biffco> if its true or false
[15:26:12] <biffco> and gives false
[15:26:15] <biffco> sorry hasClass
[15:26:15] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to know if it's set?
[15:26:17] <robertmaxrees> first off.
[15:26:24] <biffco> bcos.......................
[15:26:28] <biffco> i have datatable
[15:26:30] <biffco> and.....
[15:26:39] <robertmaxrees> this is why using classes to set this sort of stuff is a much better option :)
[15:26:53] <biffco> i want to collapse a row, and using display its not good for this
[15:26:58] <biffco> using visibility can be good
[15:27:15] <biffco> but i want to check in which row i used visibility set
[15:27:25] <biffco> if there is, i collapse
[15:27:29] <robertmaxrees> use classes instead, set css that way :)
[15:27:30] <robertmaxrees> gg.
[15:27:45] <biffco> or visible
[15:28:07] <biffco> but...
[15:28:12] <biffco> :)
[15:28:15] <biffco> its no good
[15:28:23] <biffco> just simple collapsing i want
[15:28:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:28:27] <biffco> why i should use css for that..
[15:28:33] <robertmaxrees> you already ARE using css.
[15:28:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle 'cause it sounds like something is getting lost in translation :)
[15:28:48] <biffco> for datatables its difficult to manage
[15:29:31] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: dunno what to tell ya.
[15:29:46] <biffco> what i asked
[15:29:46] <biffco> :)
[15:29:48] <biffco> thats all
[15:29:54] <robertmaxrees> see my earlier response then.
[15:29:55] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:30:07] <biffco> checking ith jquery if visibility i used for a tr (for example)
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> again.
[15:30:22] <robertmaxrees> you can only get back the current value.
[15:30:31] <biffco> ok
[15:30:33] <biffco> so i cannot check
[15:30:37] <biffco> with jquery
[15:30:40] <robertmaxrees> not reliably.
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> not jquery or javascript.
[15:31:02] <biffco> aham
[15:32:18] <biffco> or then...how can i collapse using datatables, jsut because any tuts arent working or complicated, i thought its a simple issue
[15:32:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with whatever the tutorials/docs suggest.
[15:33:36] <biffco> ok but the table style goes wrong
[15:33:42] <biffco> cells slipping and so on
[15:35:12] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: 2 things: 1 - without having it in front of me, how can I help?  I can't see the issue sooo... and 2 - I might hit up the datatables forums for help.
[15:36:05] <biffco> ok im trying to recover that version
[15:36:17] <biffco> forums gives answers womse how not working
[15:36:20] <biffco> i tried every
[15:36:25] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[15:36:33] <robertmaxrees> so how can we help? :)
[15:36:47] <biffco> if i can remake that version im showing
[15:37:15] <robertmaxrees> why not just create an isolated test case?
[15:37:19] <robertmaxrees> keep it minimal and simple?
[15:40:23] <biffco> eg.  t.row("tr_tariff1Edit").child.hide();
[15:40:37] <robertmaxrees> no idea what that means out of context.
[15:41:30] <biffco> wait wrong..
[15:42:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:42:15] <biffco> :)
[15:45:11] <biffco> t=$('#tblTariffs').DataTable();	t.row("#tr_tariff1Edit").child.hide();	t.row("#tr_tariff1View").child.show();
[15:45:15] <robertmaxrees> no idea what that means out of context.
[15:45:25] <biffco> what context should i provide?
[15:45:29] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle :)
[15:45:39] <biffco> but i have to remake all the things...
[15:45:43] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:45:44] <biffco> datas and so on
[15:45:53] <robertmaxrees> you can stub out most of it.
[15:46:04] <robertmaxrees> i don't need an entire recreation of your version.
[15:46:11] <robertmaxrees> just enough to replicate what you're tyring to do.
[15:46:17] <biffco> aham
[15:46:26] <biffco> then...im copypaste my html endresult
[15:46:36] <biffco> from browser
[15:46:38] <robertmaxrees> that's literally the opposite of what i just said :)
[15:48:06] <robertmaxrees> here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ah9q1t30/
[15:48:10] <robertmaxrees> this has jquery and datatables included.
[15:48:16] <robertmaxrees> should be simply from there.
[15:48:21] <robertmaxrees> *simple
[15:48:30] <biffco> aham thx
[15:48:36] <robertmaxrees> "aham"?
[15:50:30] <biffco> "aha"
[15:50:33] <biffco> :)
[15:50:36] <biffco> =understand
[15:50:37] <robertmaxrees> ah alright.
