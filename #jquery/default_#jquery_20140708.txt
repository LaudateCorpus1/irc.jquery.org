[00:10:13] <loostro> what happens, when I have <div id="1"> and apply $('#1').someCoolJqueryWidget()  then later on I change $('#1').attr('id', 2) ?
[00:10:29] <loostro> will the "someCoolJqueryWidget" break ? or will it continue working?
[00:10:48] <loostro> or "that depends"?
[00:13:33] <loostro> also.. what if I do $('#myDiv').html ( $('#myDiv').html().replace(/my_div_id/g, "my_new_id") ); ? i replaced the html.. so if there were any Jquery plugins attached to contents of myDiv.. they would break down, right?
[00:14:37] <Cork> loostro: yes
[00:14:44] <Cork> loostro: also you shouldn't use number only ids
[00:14:49] <Cork> css doesn't support it
[00:14:57] <Cork> add a letter infront of it
[00:15:06] <loostro> OK, how do I solve this problem then:
[00:15:13] <loostro> I have a "collection" form
[00:15:20] <loostro> with "add" and "remove" buttons
[00:15:35] <loostro> elements have ids like "my_form_0", "my_form_1" etc
[00:16:04] <loostro> what if I remove the my_form_0... should I overwrite /replace Ids of all elements?
[00:16:33] <loostro> note that each item, can contain an input field with some jquery plugin enabled.. I'd like to not break these down
[00:17:25] <loostro> or should i simply make sure that when I click "add" i just create a unique ID (and don't care if I have my_form_0, my_form_3, my_form_99)?
[00:37:44] <Cork> loostro: looks like you might want to use classes instead
[00:37:59] <Cork> then you don't need to replace so many ids
[01:00:00] <codecodecode123_> why does the last line of http://pastie.org/9366909 not work?
[01:00:10] <codecodecode123_> i have installed jquery
[01:03:02] <sacho> codecodecode123_, .width() returns the width of an element - you can't assign to a value.
[01:03:09] <sacho> perhaps you meant to do .width(ndl)
[01:03:23] <codecodecode123_> oh
[01:03:42] <codecodecode123_> wait
[01:03:55] <codecodecode123_> doesn't work
[01:06:24] <sacho> "doesn't work" is not a program error
[01:06:51] <codecodecode123_> yes
[01:15:26] <yehetju> hello
[01:19:48] <codecodecode123_> sacho: http://pastie.org/9366955 doesn't work either
[01:19:58] <codecodecode123_> any ideas?
[01:20:03] <sacho> "doesn't work" is not a program error
[01:20:07] <codecodecode123_> im out of them
[01:20:18] <codecodecode123_> yes it isn't
[01:20:18] <sacho> describe what you expect to happen, what you see happening instead, any errors you get, and so on.
[01:20:26] <codecodecode123_> no errors
[01:20:31] <Cork> and make a jsfiddle.net demo of the problem
[01:20:43] <codecodecode123_> i expect #secondary-body to be centered
[01:20:50] <codecodecode123_> css doesn't work
[01:20:59] <codecodecode123_> either
[01:21:14] <codecodecode123_> Cork: ok
[01:21:44] <sacho> appending "px" is redundant when using .width(), by the way.
[01:21:55] <codecodecode123_> oh
[01:22:00] <Cork> i don't think it is valid
[01:22:06] <sacho>  .width(50) is the same as .width("50px")
[01:22:06] <Cork> so not just redundant :)
[01:22:17] <codecodecode123_> Cork: jsfiddle doesn't suppor bootstrap
[01:22:51] <codecodecode123_> sacho: removed .concat
[01:22:53] <sacho> see "external resources"
[01:26:26] <codecodecode123_> sacho: im not very expirienced
[01:26:41] <codecodecode123_> sacho: i don't know what that means
[01:26:54] <sacho> on jsfiddle
[01:27:01] <sacho> you can include scripts and styles via "external resources"
[01:27:12] <sacho> alternatively, use jsbin
[01:27:17] <codecodecode123_> ok
[01:32:54] <codecodecode123_> sacho: http://jsbin.com/lejojodu/1
[01:33:35] <sacho> setting the width of a span doesn't really do anything
[01:34:12] <sacho> if you look in your debugger tools, you'll notice that the width is set just fine
[01:34:58] * nodedfree when doing > $('body').on('click', '#wrapper', doSomeThing);
[01:35:13] * nodedfree so $(this) return me the 'body' and i need the '#wrapper'
[01:35:44] <Cork> codebrainz: so you basically just want content to be centered on the page?
[01:36:02] <Cork> opps
[01:36:04] <Cork> *codecodecode123_:
[01:36:19] <codecodecode123_> yes Cork
[01:36:46] <codecodecode123_> sacho: making the span a div didn't work on my side
[01:36:49] <Cork> codecodecode123_: thought about just using css?
[01:36:54] <codecodecode123_> yes
[01:36:59] <Cork> span or div doesn't matter
[01:37:04] <Cork> as the element is position: fixed
[01:37:18] <Cork> that implies display: block;
[01:37:42] <codecodecode123_> so position fixed display inline
[01:37:49] <Cork> no
[01:38:06] <gjvc> 'position: fixed' implies 'display: block', right ?
[01:38:15] <Cork> like i just said yes
[01:38:49] <Cork> codecodecode123_: but why should changing width of #positioner move content?
[01:39:01] <nodedfree> Cork, any clue for me?
[01:39:08] <codecodecode123_> it's inline
[01:39:22] <Cork> nodedfree: you need to ask a question first
[01:40:18] <nodedfree> Cork, when doing > $('body').on('click', '#wrapper', doSomeThing); | so $(this) return me the 'body' BUT i need the '#wrapper', HOW CAN I GET THE CLICKED $('#wrapper')?
[01:40:53] <Cork> codecodecode123_: so this is basically what you want? http://jsbin.com/lejojodu/2/edit
[01:41:00] <Cork> except code should move down too?
[01:41:04] <Cork> *content
[01:41:36] <Cork> nodedfree: this shouldn't be body in that line
[01:41:54] <Cork> you would have to make an example for anyone to help you, as something else is wrong
[01:42:24] <nodedfree> Cork, the #wrapper is an element that creates by ajax call, only with body it can work out
[01:42:39] <sacho> nodedfree, http://jsfiddle.net/H4rkc/1/
[01:42:56] <sacho> nodedfree, you're confused.
[01:44:32] <nodedfree> sacho, why is that
[01:44:37] <sacho>  technically, you could use event.currentTarget, but in your case, it's equal to `this`.
[01:45:23] <sacho> nodedfree, `this` in a delegated event handler is the element specified by the delegate selector.
[01:45:26] <sacho> in your case, #wrapper.
[01:45:51] <nodedfree> but 'this' returns me the body :S
[01:46:57] <codecodecode123_> sacho: sorry
[01:47:11] <codecodecode123_> my irc client broke itself
[01:47:13] <nodedfree> sacho, for example i did $(this).hide(); everything disappeard
[01:47:16] <Cork> codecodecode123_: http://jsbin.com/lejojodu/2/edit
[01:47:25] <sacho> nodedfree, make a test case.
[01:47:26] <Cork> is that what you're looking for?
[01:47:45] <codecodecode123_> YES EXACTLY
[01:47:52] <Cork> so no js needed
[01:47:57] <codecodecode123_> cork: thanks
[01:48:00] <Cork> np
[01:48:19] <nodedfree> sacho, the actual action is 'drop', any known issues with it?
[01:48:44] <sacho> 'the actual action'?
[01:48:59] <Cork> i still quince when i see <span><p></p></span>...
[01:49:07] <Cork> old habits die hard i guess...
[01:49:21] <sacho> why would you ever have a habit to put paragraphs in spans
[01:49:28] <nodedfree> it's drop instead of click, the click was to simplify the question
[01:49:42] <Cork> sacho: it was explicitly not valid for a while
[01:49:42] <sacho> nodedfree, the event is irrelevant.
[01:49:57] <Cork> inline elements could not hold block elements
[01:50:17] <codecodecode123_> cork: hold on a minute
[01:50:18] <Cork> (pre inline-block days)
[01:50:35] <codecodecode123_> cork: all text is now centered!
[01:50:58] <Cork> codecodecode123_: set text-align: left; on the secondary-body element
[01:51:06] <codecodecode123_> ok
[01:51:26] <codecodecode123_> it woked
[01:51:29] <codecodecode123_> thanks
[01:51:35] <Cork> yw :)
[01:51:41] <nodedfree> sacho, solved
[01:51:55] <nodedfree> added function(e),
[01:52:07] <nodedfree> then $(e.target) did the job
[01:52:21] <sacho> uh huh.
[01:52:26] <nodedfree> ;]
[02:13:16] <HowardwLo> anyone use wookmark jquery plugin?
[02:13:20] <HowardwLo> with the filtering option
[02:16:20] <HowardwLo> similar to how filtering works here http://razorjack.net/quicksand/
[02:16:42] <HowardwLo> it works fine when the count is low, but when i have hundreds of img and filters, it gets really choppy
[02:33:49] <fattest> How can I make my vertical scrolling work, where if i scroll down passed a certain element, the element in my navigation bar (left) will have an active class? http://jsbin.com/towew/1/edit
[02:35:40] <fattest> any help would be much appreciated
[02:36:09] <FarLight> I will check it
[02:36:16] <fattest> thank you so much
[02:39:05] <FarLight> $('#.sidebar-nav li')
[02:39:21] <FarLight> you didnt mean to have that # there did you?
[02:39:35] <fattest> probably not
[02:43:23] <Voyage> for people who have used both angular and ember, I have a question. For what type of projects is each most suited? Whats the theme behind both?
[02:47:59] <fattest> farlight: what should i do to get it to work?
[02:49:37] <FarLight> fattest there are a lot of small errors here
[02:50:20] <FarLight> first, when I open the menu
[02:50:38] <FarLight> Uncaught ReferenceError: $target is not defined
[02:51:17] <FarLight> oops
[02:51:25] <FarLight> I mean this error:
[02:51:25] <fattest> ooh
[02:51:25] <FarLight> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined
[02:51:32] <FarLight> You're asking for a hash
[02:51:35] <FarLight> inside the target
[02:51:43] <fattest> i do see
[02:51:44] <FarLight> but there is just this href="#"
[02:51:53] <FarLight> thats one error
[02:51:58] <fattest> yes
[02:52:25] <FarLight> Another is that you are cycling over all the list elements in .sidebar-nav
[02:52:26] <FarLight> $('.sidebar-nav li').each(function () {
[02:53:21] <FarLight> Then you are trying to get a reference to an element from the anchor tag in that element
[02:53:32] <FarLight> this line:
[02:53:38] <FarLight> var refElement = $(currLink.attr("href"));
[02:55:45] <FarLight> but the first one you come across is sidebar-brand
[02:56:02] <FarLight> which has a href value of top
[02:56:13] <FarLight> so you are trying to use top as a css selector
[02:56:24] <FarLight> and you're selecting nothing
[02:56:52] <FarLight> then you're trying to get the top attribute of the result of the position function on an element that isn't even defined
[02:57:03] <FarLight> so its getting angry at you
[02:58:43] <FarLight> and top4 is missing a href value
[02:59:12] <FarLight> or at least it is inconsistent with the rest
[03:03:44] <fattest> FarLight: can you please put one of the link to work as an example?
[03:04:09] <FarLight> Just so I understand what you actually want,
[03:04:33] <FarLight> you want the link in the expandable side panel to gain a class when the user scrolls past its top value on the page
[03:04:43] <FarLight> even though the link itself remains in place
[03:05:01] <FarLight> is that right?
[03:06:02] <fattest> yes
[03:06:06] <fattest> ill show you an example
[03:07:03] <FarLight> okay
[03:07:12] <Voyage> for people who have used both angular and ember, I have a question. For "what type of projects" is each most suited? Whats the theme behind both?
[03:08:22] <fattest> FarLight: look at http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/ do you see the navigation on the right, where it changes the text color when you scroll down past a certain element?
[03:08:37] <fattest> Farlight: I'm trying to achieve something like that
[03:09:23] <FarLight> haha I see
[03:09:29] <fattest> indeed!
[03:10:04] <fattest> FarLight: and when you click on the navigation link on the right, it should scroll down to that that element, as shown in the bootstrap site.
[03:10:28] <FarLight> okay let me check it again
[03:10:43] <fattest> FarLight: thank you so much
[03:23:30] <fattest> FarLight: any luck with it?
[03:23:59] <FarLight> yeah but when I pull the menu out it stops working
[03:25:02] <FarLight> If I send you the lin
[03:25:05] <FarLight> link will
[03:25:11] <fattest> Farlight: bootstrap has scrollspy built in
[03:25:20] <fattest> FarLight: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy but I can't seem to get it to work
[03:25:33] <FarLight> http://jsbin.com/wapewuza/1/edit
[03:26:04] <FarLight> I made top2 and top3 way bigger so you could see the effect
[03:26:21] <FarLight> they were the only 2 it seemed you had in ther
[03:26:43] <fattest> how about scrollspy?
[03:27:11] <FarLight> never used it, maybe you should have looked into that first lol
[03:27:23] <fattest> FarLight: thats where i came from lol!
[03:27:40] <fattest> I'll try it nw
[03:27:49] <FarLight> ok I'm gonna go eat, good luck
[03:28:11] <fattest> thanks so much for your help
[03:28:27] <lintguy> Hallo
[03:29:13] <fattest> hi
[03:29:19] <lintguy> Wzap?
[03:29:47] <fattest> fiddling with bootstrap scroolspy
[03:31:08] <lintguy> scrollspy? What's that?
[03:31:58] <fattest> lintguy: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
[03:32:16] <fattest> you good with jquery
[03:32:41] <lintguy> Above average i'd say
[03:34:59] <lintguy> You stuck?
[03:35:58] <lintguy1> Sorry, got disconnected
[03:57:43] <berpcor> I have .on('scroll', function(){...}). I want actions in anonymous functions be started only after 2 sec delay after scrolling is stopped. How to do that?
[03:58:42] <berpcor> Or I want to show autocomplete only after user stopped typing. Not after he typed any letter.
[03:58:55] <berpcor> Principles should be the same.
[03:59:00] <StephenS> Yews
[03:59:48] <berpcor> And how can I do that?
[04:02:24] <sacho> berpcor, check out the debounce plugin.
[04:03:50] <berpcor> sacho: Thank you.
[04:06:49] <berpcor> sacho: Exactly what I need. Thank you again )
[04:13:17] <nFFF> I am wanting to change an image opacity from 0 to 1 - which is fine - but is there anyway to do it by randomly making parts of the image appear at different times?
[04:17:38] <Cork> nFFF: not without duplicating the image
[04:18:01] <Cork> nFFF: or through svg
[04:19:40] <nFFF> Cork, Im wanting to achieve this native in the browser: http://www.loropiana.com/flash.html#/lang:en
[04:19:47] <nFFF> is it possible, or should I leave it?
[04:20:15] <interop_madness> am i the only one having problems with firebug 2.0.1? breakpoints are completely broken in every way (placing them, stopping on them,not stopping if no breakpoint etc.)
[04:21:41] <Cork> nFFF: that only gives me a white page
[04:22:03] <Cork> interop_madness: works fine here
[04:22:53] <Cork> interop_madness: your on ff30+?
[04:23:25] <interop_madness> Cork, yes, ff30
[04:23:55] <Cork> hmm oh, i'm still on b1
[04:23:59] * Cork updates
[04:24:30] <interop_madness> once i place a breakpoint somewhere, execution stops on arbitrary self-executing anonymous function, jquery plugin definitions, to be precise
[04:24:52] <interop_madness> the breakpoint  itself is never hit, even though execution is known to pass it
[04:24:58] <Cork> yup still works fine
[04:25:13] <interop_madness> i had the *exact* same problems with chrome which is why i switched to FF
[04:25:18] <sacho> are you using a poorly defined sourcemap?
[04:25:18] <Cork> interop_madness: try in a clean profile
[04:25:28] <Cork> might be some interop problem with some other extension?
[04:25:30] <interop_madness> did FF exchange their JS engine to V8?
[04:25:34] <sacho> no
[04:25:35] <Cork> no
[04:25:47] <sacho> chrome doesn't have this problem, either
[04:25:48] <Cork> interop_madness: but the fbug2 uses the new debugger
[04:25:49] <interop_madness> no, no sourcemaps at all
[04:25:49] <sacho> (generally)
[04:26:09] <Cork> that firefox added back in ~ff2
[04:26:33] <Cork> and it's the same debugger the built in tools use
[04:28:16] <interop_madness> this seems to be a widespread problem: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebug/UU9mh7WUaBk
[04:29:47] <sacho> 3 people raging and one who had his issue solved
[04:29:51] <sacho> wouldn't call that widespread
[04:35:13] <jop008> I have this          $('input', $('#textcontainer')).each(function() {       console.log($(this)); //log every element found to console output
[04:35:14] <jop008>           });
[04:35:43] <jop008> When I do $('input', $('#textcontainer')). I see an array with one element
[04:35:59] <interop_madness> well since there is no elaboration on how to solve that problem and i am affected, it seems i have to revert to ff29 and block the update url
[04:36:05] <jop008> however console.log is not there
[04:39:42] <nFFF> Cork, does the homepage work for you http://www.loropiana.com/
[04:39:52] <nFFF> then just click English, should have a little animation
[04:40:01] <nFFF> Im not sure if this is possible without flash
[04:40:33] <Cork> nFFF: nope, looks like you depend on a too new flash version
[04:41:14] <Cork> linux has the lovingly modern flash version 11.2
[04:41:21] <nFFF> Basically, it's an image, and the flash animation is like the image being 'drawn' last about 4 seconds
[04:41:35] <nFFF> but parts of the image appear at different times so it looks like its being drawn evry fast
[04:41:43] <nFFF> how would one achieve this type of animation
[04:41:56] <Cork> let me boot up my window vm
[04:43:50] <nFFF> If it can be done in flash, it must be able to eb achieved in js? :|
[04:43:55] <jop008> solved
[04:46:54] <Cork> nFFF: it is
[04:47:03] <Cork> at worst you can do it with <canvas>
[04:47:17] <Cork> it might be possible to do without, but can't say before i see it
[04:47:46] <Cork> nFFF: but yes, there isn't anything you can do in flash that you can't do in normal web now days
[04:47:52] <Cork> even drm is supported now
[04:48:30] <nFFF> If you manage to load up the site, let me know, as need some specific help with how to implement the drawing animations
[04:48:47] <nFFF> There seems to be multiple elements -> main characters - outlines - block colours
[04:49:03] <nFFF> and these are drawn on the screen simulteanusly to look like a painter is doingh
[04:49:23] <Cork> hmm interesting
[04:49:30] <Cork> i still get a white page on windows
[04:49:34] <flam_> hi, how can i set the data-* values to be json arrays (like data-groups='["group1","group2"]') so that they can be parsed as array and i can do $.inArray with them? when i'm generating them for the first time using server side code $.inArray works fine but after an ajax call i'm setting up updated attributes with .data() but then the updated attributes are parsed as strings
[04:49:40] * Cork hates flash sooo much
[04:49:57] <Cork> nFFF: so ya, good luck with that
[04:50:07] <flam_> i can probably do some stupid typeof conditionals in the function that uses those attributes but i would like to solve this without that
[04:50:10] <nFFF> Let me see if i can screenshot it
[04:50:21] <Cork> flam_: just entity encode it
[04:50:53] <Cork> data-groups="[&#x22;group1&#x22;,&#x22;group2&#x22;]"
[04:51:36] <nFFF> Cork, is there any tools that auto screenshot + save?
[04:51:55] <Cork> nFFF: built into firefox, and i think chrome
[04:57:16] <raj> Cork, have you ever created a flash site?
[04:57:47] <Cork> i've been asked :)
[04:57:57] <Cork> but i refuse to do a full flash site
[04:58:38] <Cork> raj: and i have converted flash parts to none flash
[05:03:18] <nFFF> Ok cant make a video of this thing its like 1gb :|
[05:04:13] <raj> Cork, taking the internet off its flash addiction, one customer at at ime
[05:04:22] <Cork> raj: for sure
[05:04:35] <Cork> i usually don't have flash installed at all anymore
[05:04:41] <raj> no way
[05:04:46] <Cork> the little flash i need is from shumway
[05:04:47] <raj> how do you watch illegal tv shows?
[05:05:01] <Cork> raj: illeagal?
[05:05:15] <Cork> what shows would that be?
[05:05:30] <Cork> though i'm not a big tv guy
[05:05:36] <raj> then get a little tv
[05:05:38] <Cork> so that might be the answer
[05:05:45] <Cork> heh
[05:05:45] * raj badumchik
[05:06:17] <raj> i mean, there is a lot of good television these days
[05:06:29] <raj> not sure about your neck of the woods, but certainly in the US
[05:07:42] <raj> am I right to assume people in other countries watch more of their local TV than US television?
[05:08:43] <Cork> raj: i scroll through the tv tableau when i'm at my fokes from time to time
[05:09:07] <Cork> and no there is like one or two things a month that i could possibly think of watching
[05:09:19] <Cork> the rest is just junk
[05:11:11] <raj> 99% is junk, but that 1% is gold
[05:11:46] <raj> homeland, house of cards, orange is the new black, game of thrones, g-string divas
[05:12:19] <raj> I feel like I haven't been in here in ages
[05:12:23] <raj> where are all the customers?
[05:12:35] <raj> you solved everyone's problems apparently
[05:12:37] <raj> queue 0
[05:17:01] <interop_madness> is homeland really that good? i find it hard starting new series
[05:17:23] <raj> interop_madness, one of the best
[05:17:26] <raj> and I don't say that lightly
[05:17:31] <interop_madness> compared to HoC?
[05:17:36] <raj> it's up there with the Wire
[05:17:42] <interop_madness> because that's the last series i truly enjoyed
[05:17:46] <raj> it is arguably better than HoC
[05:18:07] <nFFF> Cork, on principle of creating a drawing animation, how would you achieve this?
[05:18:21] <interop_madness> ok i'll force myself through 2-3 episodes. usually i get hooked after 2
[05:18:50] <Cork> nFFF: like draw the colors of the picture you mean?
[05:19:29] <raj> Cork, am I understanding this incorrectly, does Shumway "convert" flash into html5 on the fly?
[05:19:36] <nFFF> Yes, say you hae an outline of some buildings
[05:19:38] <Cork> raj: no
[05:19:43] <nFFF> and you want to randomly draw the lines
[05:19:49] <nFFF> rather than just 'show' them
[05:19:55] <Cork> raj: shumway is a flash play implemented in js + canvas
[05:20:02] <Cork> it doesn't convert anything
[05:20:09] <Cork> it actually runs the flv file
[05:21:08] <Cork> *flash player
[05:21:19] <nFFF> Cork, I guess what I need to do is draw sections randomly
[05:21:39] <nFFF> So I need to split the image up into random sections area between x && y
[05:21:43] <nFFF> and tehn randomly draw them
[05:22:24] <Cork> nFFF: if you have the original project you could try compiling it with a new version of adobe air
[05:22:36] <Cork> it lets you generate web based versions
[05:28:43] <rootytooty> sup people, how come i cant target this selector? http://jsfiddle.net/94v2f/
[05:29:20] <Cork> rootytooty: $this('.subnav-inner') => $this.find('.subnav-inner')
[05:30:03] <nFFF> Cork, you mean the source of the flash code?
[05:30:13] <Cork> nFFF: yes the source project
[05:30:14] <rootytooty> Cork - tried that doesn't want to work? http://jsfiddle.net/94v2f/1/
[05:31:20] <nFFF> Cork, it's propietary code, loro piana are a billion dollar fashion brand
[05:31:25] <Cork> rootytooty: http://jsfiddle.net/94v2f/2/
[05:31:42] <Cork> nFFF: ah, you want to reproduce it
[05:31:56] <Cork> nFFF: well all i can say is that it is possible
[05:33:32] <rootytooty> thanks Cork I need to work on my selectors, would you advise any learning / termonology to search for to improve that?
[05:33:37] <nFFF> Cork, I need to create an algorithm that draws sections of an image simultaneously. So would need to 'draw' different sections of the image, in different directions
[05:33:54] <Cork> rootytooty: to start with i would recommend stop abusing the <a> tag
[05:33:59] <Cork> it is for links not actions
[05:34:40] <Cork> rootytooty: opera has a nice web standard tutorial
[05:34:46] <Cork> rootytooty: and mdn isn't bad either
[05:35:48] <raj> Cork, that's sort of what I eant
[05:35:49] <raj> *meant
[05:35:54] <raj> so I don't need to install adobe flash
[05:36:13] <raj> and I can just have that and it'll play all flash video players using canvas/js
[05:36:21] <Cork> raj: sure, though note shumway is in pre alpha right now
[05:36:33] <raj> and only for ff
[05:36:36] <Cork> no
[05:36:46] <Cork> it works in any fairly modern browser
[05:37:26] <Cork> raj: http://mozilla.github.io/shumway/examples/racing/
[05:37:36] <Cork> should work in both chrome firefox and ie11
[05:37:41] <Cork> without flash
[05:37:47] <raj> chrome accepts an xpi file type?
[05:38:07] <Cork> raj: that is the extension version
[05:38:16] <Cork> you don't have to run shumway as an extension
[05:38:20] <Cork> you can embed it in the page too
[05:40:05] <Evil_Work> http://jsfiddle.net/2ZMzb/ <- this is being seriously stupid in IE9
[05:40:16] <raj> I was considering using it as a consumer, not as a developer on my own page
[05:40:42] <Evil_Work> I get a prompt to download something instead of what I expect, which is for the values to get logged to the console
[05:41:51] <darkfrog> is there an easy way to determine if an element has a specific ancestor?
[05:42:14] <Cork> Evil_Work: well it is pre ie10 dev tools; what do you expect?
[05:42:29] <Evil_Work> I expect console.log() to work :P
[05:42:41] <Cork> darkfrog: $(this).parent().is(elm)
[05:42:48] <Cork> or
[05:43:00] <Cork> darkfrog: $(this).paremnts(elm).length > 0
[05:43:10] <darkfrog> Cork: ah, that's better. :)
[05:43:21] <Cork> if you want to check with a selector
[05:43:29] <Cork> to actually use the found parent
[05:43:34] <Cork> you should use .closest()
[05:43:52] <Cork> darkfrog: $(this).closet('.container').addClass()
[05:45:36] <JustMozzy> since the #googlemaps channel is dead I'm going to ask here. is it possible to use non image based markers in google maps?
[05:48:43] <rootytooty> cork what would you recommend instead of an anchor for an action? I know various front end frameworks such as bootstrap, foundation use data actions for this kind of thing
[05:49:00] <Cork> rootytooty: <button>
[05:49:11] <Cork> and then style it to look like what you want
[05:49:42] <Cork> rootytooty: <a href=""> should only be used
[05:49:49] <Cork> if you give the href="" a meaning full url
[05:50:01] <Cork> # and javascript:void(0) is not examples of that
[05:50:15] <Cork> href="" is another one i've seen more and more
[05:50:27] <Cork> ro <a> without href at all
[05:50:32] <Cork> *or
[05:50:47] <rootytooty> roger that, cheers!
[05:51:08] <Cork> rootytooty: the reason many still use <a> for click actions
[05:51:21] <Cork> is cause back in ie5.5 and earlier, it was the only elements you could bind a click event to
[05:51:28] <Cork> but that is a time LONG past
[05:51:49] <Cork> so ppl should stop abusing poor old <a>, and instead use proper tags
[05:53:43] <rootytooty> :) thanks
[05:56:02] <md1985> Can anyone tell me how to solve a problem of a $post issue with google maps?
[05:56:10] <sacho> carefully
[05:56:27] <Cork> :D
[05:57:13] <md1985> Has anyone got experince using google maps api v3?
[05:57:58] <Cork> sacho: reminds me of a local joke here; "how do hedgehogs mate?" -- "carefully"
[05:58:48] <md1985> I am basically trying to put markers on a map but only on one map instance
[05:59:16] <sacho> that's nice
[05:59:43] <Cork> md1985: i've used it, but not frequent enough to keep the caveats in memory
[06:00:12] <Cork> its a constant reschooling of the problems every time ^^'
[06:00:45] <md1985> Cork: heres my code I am trying to get the actions above in one $post function http://jsbin.com/lajumazu/1/
[06:01:20] <Cork> uh...
[06:01:28] <Cork> var mapContent = $('').html(); <-- WTF??
[06:01:41] <md1985> Cork: sorry jeez saved wrong
[06:01:43] <Cork> why not just mapContent = '';
[06:01:44] <Cork> ?
[06:02:04] <md1985> Cork: ignore mapContent
[06:02:35] <sacho> that's a lot of code and very little relevance.
[06:02:41] <Cork> sure, though that line still scares me
[06:02:58] <md1985> so $.post(ajaxurl, dataEvent, function(response) {} $.post(ajaxurl, data, function(response) {} are 2 functions that need to just be one if you know what I mean
[06:03:31] <sacho> ...
[06:03:54] <sacho> function doStuff() { $.post(...) } and use doStuff in both places.
[06:03:55] <Cork> so you want to merge the dataEvent and data varialbes?
[06:04:06] <md1985> Cork: yes
[06:04:29] <Cork> md1985: you can't really do that
[06:04:38] <Cork> it would overwrite each other
[06:04:43] <Cork> as both as an action
[06:04:48] <md1985> okay
[06:05:03] <md1985> The issue is that it lodas 2 map instances when I uust want 1
[06:06:35] <Cork> md1985: how is the server backend suppose to separate those two actions?
[06:07:01] <md1985> Cork: there are 2 functions that create the json in wordpress
[06:07:11] <Cork> ok?
[06:07:16] <md1985> Cork: sorry the array and then it is decoded
[06:07:50] <Cork> so you want to have the two objects as { action: ['action1', 'action2'] }?
[06:08:03] <md1985> Cork: yes
[06:08:10] <Cork> meaning you get ?action[]=action1&action[]=action2
[06:08:28] <md1985> and then pass that into the $post data
[06:09:27] <Cork> md1985: btw be careful with those tailing commas
[06:09:32] <Cork> ie doens't like those
[06:09:50] <md1985> Cork: which one specifically
[06:10:00] <md1985> The code does need refactoring
[06:10:03] <Cork> after the action:
[06:11:42] <md1985> Cork: so to get the objects to work in an array its impossible or does it need to be a different approach?
[06:13:30] <Cork> md1985: could do something like this http://jsbin.com/lajumazu/2/edit
[06:14:16] <Cork> md1985: well not impossible, just not very practical
[06:15:53] <JustMozzy> oh how I hate when a major component has no docs -.-
[06:15:58] <JustMozzy> fuck you google maps
[06:16:37] <JustMozzy> or rather jquery ui gmaps
[06:17:51] <md1985> Cork: so to get that right it would need to be $.post(ajaxurl, merged, function(response) for one execution of the function?
[06:18:05] <Cork> md1985: yes
[06:18:27] <Cork> md1985: if what you've asked for is actually what you're looking for that is :)
[06:20:09] <md1985> Cork: the only issue is it does not execute the action itself inside the $post function.
[06:20:32] <Cork> md1985: most likely cause the server doesn't support that format
[06:20:42] <Cork> so it returns a 4xx error
[06:20:45] <Cork> (or 5xx)
[06:20:55] <md1985> yeah probably
[06:21:08] <md1985> oh well it was worth trying I suppose
[06:38:15] <Evil_Work> Does anyone have a clue why .serialize() would work if the <form> isn't inside <p> tags, but removing the <p> tags makes it work correctly?
[06:38:20] <Evil_Work> IE9
[06:38:59] <BillCriswell> Evil_Work: You run into some funky shit lol
[06:39:13] <Evil_Work> King of the Edge Case, that's me
[06:39:17] <BillCriswell> Evil_Work: You you reproduce it in a fiddle?
[06:39:19] <Cork> Evil_Work: it might depend on the old block inline thingy
[06:39:32] <Evil_Work> BillCriswell: Sec
[06:39:36] <Cork> where you arn't allowed to put a lot of elements into other elements
[06:39:46] <Cork> old ie and old firefox loved to do that
[06:40:07] <BillCriswell> I always kind of hopes a form only gave a shit about the input elements.
[06:40:13] <BillCriswell> hoped*
[06:40:16] <Evil_Work> no, I can't reproduce it in a fiddle :P
[06:40:39] <Evil_Work> Adding the <p> to what I had in the fiddle doesn't break it
[06:40:51] <BillCriswell> Evil_Work: Bummer.
[06:41:11] <Cork> time for a new hypothesis then :)
[06:41:40] <Evil_Work> Well removing the <p> definitely fixes what I was seeing, so I'm not inclined to investigate much further
[06:41:40] <BillCriswell> I don't understand how I'm comfortable writing PHP but I don't like writing it.
[06:41:58] <Es0teric> does anyone know the room name for grunt?
[06:42:42] <BillCriswell> It's literally grunt.
[06:43:07] <BillCriswell> Well, #grunt
[06:56:01] <Fishbowne> hey anyone know of a Click-up or click timeout event for Jquery ?
[06:56:14] <Fishbowne> for restoring a button to its previous state ?
[06:58:04] <Marheu> hello
[06:58:11] <Marheu> http://sciactive.github.io/pnotify/
[06:58:24] <Marheu> I'm working in this plugin and I use the tooltip hover function
[06:59:09] <Marheu> I would like that invisible div that appears still showing while the cursor is over the div
[06:59:11] <Marheu> how can I get it
[07:08:30] <BillCriswell> The majority of people don't even seem to try on stackoverflow.
[07:08:48] <BillCriswell> Fishbowne: setTimeout() can work.
[07:09:32] <BillCriswell> Marheu: Looks like you just want to toggle opacity of a fixed position div?
[07:17:43] <Marheu> BillCriswell : instantly when I mouse out the  hover hide automatically
[07:17:52] <Marheu> I need to show when the mouse is over the div
[07:25:01] <Forbidd3n> What would cause this error - TypeError: e.nodeName.toLowerCase is not a function?
[07:26:08] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Are you sure e.nodeName is retuning a string?
[07:27:26] <BillCriswell> Marheu: http://jsbin.com/hewiwefo/1/edit?html,css,output like this?
[07:27:48] <BillCriswell> I made the tip opacity: .2 so you actually know where it is, but if you change it to 0 it'll still work.
[07:34:59] <Getterac7> So I'm trying to send some data including a Blob to a php script as POST data... the blob doesn't make it over the wire, but the other data does. Any suggestions? Here's what i've got.. https://gist.github.com/Getterac7/0efbc9e37273b68bfeb6
[07:37:33] <Getterac7> PS - I'm using jQuery 2.1.0
[07:44:38] <BillCriswell> I really hate the way support people speak to me.
[07:44:55] <BillCriswell> "It's going to be so great to help you with this problem!"
[07:49:15] <sacho> I'm so excited to answer your question
[07:49:55] <BillCriswell> Just be my friend till I get pissed then you can turn on the professionalism.
[07:51:30] <BillCriswell> Chances are I won't get pissed so let's just make it quick haha
[07:56:25] <BillCriswell> "Thank you for cooperating"
[08:05:58] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, some ISPs i've had have been absolute shitheads when it comes to support.. "Hi, we've got no connection here at the server hall, is there an issue on your network?" -"Hello sir, [without pausing, or checking] there are no issues on our HOME INTERNET NETWORK, did you try turning your modem off and on again?" -"Modem? What? No, this is a business connection, this is a server hall..." -"Right, do you see the little black box
[08:10:06] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: I've stop doing business with someone that bad ahah
[08:10:18] <Jattenalle> that's what i did as well :P
[08:10:38] <Jattenalle> final straw with that particular ISP, was when they sent out a letter
[08:10:44] <Jattenalle> asking me to use "less bandwidth"
[08:11:11] <Jattenalle> i mean, just because i paid for 100mbit unmetered bandwidth doesnt mean i can actually USE it, right
[08:12:06] <kelewe> hello
[08:12:47] <DeliriumTremens> Anyone familiar with jQplot -- I'm trying to use the DateAxisRenderer, but when I do it stops displaying the data on the chart (the tick labels are working though)
[08:14:11] <DeliriumTremens> I can provide the code i'm using...http://pastebin.com/icXnUafK
[08:14:35] <DeliriumTremens> CategoryAxisRenderer works fine
[08:16:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If you have a DIVA inside DIVB and both have click handlers, how do you avoid that a click on DIVA triggers the handler of DIVB?
[08:17:27] <m1su> ecky--ptang-zoob http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[08:18:43] <jaspertheghost_> does anyone know an alternative to List.js shitty JS library ?
[08:18:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[08:19:35] <jaspertheghost_> nvm
[08:20:34] <pcfreak30> would this work as a css selector?
[08:20:36] <pcfreak30> .item .quantity:visible + .product_id
[08:24:39] <joephilly> if I have $().ready(function() { var something = ... }); then I have function abc() { something.whatever; }, will 'something' be out of scope?
[08:26:29] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[08:27:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> gotcha
[08:27:38] <BillCriswell> joephilly: Depends where function abc() is.
[08:27:57] <joephilly> BillCriswell, its basically like how I wrote it
[08:28:12] <joephilly> same file
[08:28:44] <BillCriswell> If you want something available inside both of them you'd need to do like var something; $().read(function(){ something = .... }); function abc(){ something.whatever }
[08:29:08] <BillCriswell> Could wrap that up in an IIFE to avoid a global something.
[08:39:55] <DeltaHeavy> How do I use event delegation with .bind()? I'm using jQuery 1.4.x and want what would happen if you replaced bind() with on() in this paste - https://www.refheap.com/87979
[08:41:17] <duch_kazatel> .bind() doesn't do delegated listeners.
[08:41:54] <duch_kazatel> if you're using at least version 1.4.2, you use .delegate()
[08:41:55] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:42:15] <DeltaHeavy> Awesome, thanks
[08:42:23] <duch_kazatel> why such an old versoipm ntw
[08:42:26] <duch_kazatel> *btw
[08:42:31] <duch_kazatel> *version
[08:42:35] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Cause it's an older e-commerce site.
[08:43:07] <duch_kazatel> if you ever get the chance, update that shiz.
[08:43:10] <duch_kazatel> totally worth it.
[08:43:22] <DeltaHeavy> Naw, would take WAY too long to test. Not worth the investment.
[08:43:48] <duch_kazatel> we recently did it for one of our stores and are about to do it on another.  it's actually not too difficult, but okay.
[08:44:08] <DeltaHeavy> All depends on the shop. This one is huge. the ROI makes it not worth it.
[08:44:26] <duch_kazatel> ours is pretty huge, too ;) that's why we decided the ROI was worth it :).
[08:44:51] <DeltaHeavy> The site is really going to preform the same as far as the user is concerned :p
[08:44:59] <DeltaHeavy> Also this one was molested by oversea devs
[08:45:36] <duch_kazatel> we actually saw a minor performance increase in our case, and it made our developer's lives WAY easier.  painful in the beginning, but it wound up being totally worth it.  different strokes though.
[08:46:28] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, with this site there's a huge risk of shit breaking just because of the amount of hacks and shitty code.
[08:46:53] <duch_kazatel> yep - we had a lot of stuff like people using constuctors just for the side-effects.
[08:47:30] <duch_kazatel> and code that was relying on bugs in how jquery handles things like .append() on things you can't technically append to.
[08:47:42] <duch_kazatel> was worth it in our case.
[08:57:32] <bongjovi> I have my jquery script just before the closing tag, but I'm using a module that requires jquery and also requires that it be in the head of the document
[08:57:59] <duch_kazatel> why does it have to be in the head?
[08:58:18] <bongjovi> No idea, google maps api
[08:58:29] <bongjovi> I just get an alert if it's not in the head
[08:59:28] <bongjovi> Is it really bad practice to have jquery in the head of the document?
[08:59:47] <duch_kazatel> i almost always put it in the head.
[09:00:28] <duch_kazatel> are you getting errors with putting the maps script on the head but leaving jquery before the closing body tag?
[09:00:55] <joephilly> BillCriswell, i just made it global. Globals are awesome right?
[09:01:04] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know why my delegate event isn't working? - https://www.refheap.com/db4804cef8eb6c9f0a5b8761e
[09:01:19] <DeltaHeavy> 'change' won't work on the select box as it's janky garbage.
[09:01:55] <bongjovi> duch_kazatel, yeah
[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> can you add a class and bind to that instead, DeltaHeavy?
[09:01:59] <bongjovi> that $ is undefined
[09:02:20] <DeltaHeavy> bongjobi: How? I can make calls to jQ easy inside there.
[09:02:47] <bongjovi> I guess because it's loading that script before jQuery..?
[09:03:02] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: A lot of this content is generated after the initial page load, and will continue to be based on the users interaction.
[09:03:09] <DeltaHeavy> bongjovi: I do'nt know what you're talking about. jQ is defined in there.
[09:03:20] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy he wasn't talking to you broseph.
[09:03:29] <DeltaHeavy> Derp
[09:03:31] <bongjovi> heh
[09:03:45] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy the thing you're bidning to - can you add a class to that instead?
[09:04:06] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: A lot of this content is generated after the initial page load, and will continue to be based on the users interaction.
[09:04:11] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[09:04:17] <duch_kazatel> that has nothing to do with my question.
[09:04:23] <Fishbowne> is there a click up function ?
[09:04:36] <duch_kazatel> the target you're binding on must exist.
[09:04:37] <Fishbowne> for amking a button restore its state.
[09:04:52] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: It does though no?
[09:05:04] <BillCriswell> joephilly: Haha.
[09:05:10] <decx> mouseup?
[09:05:16] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy that answer has nothing to do with my question, no.
[09:05:25] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy can you use classes and target those instead?
[09:05:27] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Then I'm clueless as to what yuo're asking right now.
[09:05:44] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Sure, I'll update the template
[09:05:47] <rhinoboss> I have a jquery button with an image applied to it in css. When the image is applied, the 3d "look" of the button disappears and all I see it the image (which has transparency). Is this a common problem?
[09:06:13] <duch_kazatel> $('.canThisBeAClassAlsoItHasToExistOnPageload').delegate( '.makeThisAClassToo', eventType, handler )
[09:06:22] <nFFF>  Guys in canvas I have a white rectangle, I want to change a delete a pixel (turn to transparent), how do?
[09:07:06] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy there's also .live(), which might be easier for you do use in this case..
[09:07:49] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Going to be a bit. It populates it via JS -_-
[09:08:12] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy no clue what you mean - have you tried using .live() instead?
[09:08:17] <codekK> Hello, i have a little problems with sidebar, im using Bootstrap and jQuery, i have a sidebar at left and i want when i click a one item expand this item and hide the others, it works fine but my problem is about change the class to my "<span>" for get other class in all "<span>" that arent expanded to change the Arrow its showed. Here the example: http://jsfiddle.net/jF7m7/
[09:08:28] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Nope, should I drop doing this and look at live()?
[09:08:36] <DeltaHeavy> I really just want to recreate delgation like .on()
[09:08:57] <DeltaHeavy> God damn Interspire is a pile of garbage
[09:09:20] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy .delegate() is the closest to that, but you're using some funky selectors to accomplish that. does this element exist on pageload? -> $('tr.GridRow[id^="tr"]')
[09:09:32] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Nope
[09:10:03] <duch_kazatel> the thing you're running .delegate() on needs to exist on pageload.
[09:10:13] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: I moved it on to 'body' a little while ago
[09:10:13] <duch_kazatel> or whenever you bind to it.
[09:10:14] <DeltaHeavy> No dice
[09:10:26] <duch_kazatel> try .live() instead.  if that doesn't work, then you have other problems.
[09:10:57] <rhinoboss> I have a jquery button with an image applied to it in css. When the image is applied, the 3d "look" of the button disappears and all I see it the image (which has transparency). Is this a common problem?

[09:12:12] <Fishbowne> is there a click up function ?
[09:12:21] <Fishbowne> for restoring a button state ?
[09:12:21] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: mouseup
[09:12:27] <Fishbowne> can't seem to get that to work
[09:12:43] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: Is this for applying CSS and stuff like that? You'd be best off using ':active'
[09:12:43] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne what button state?
[09:12:43] <decx> what's a button state
[09:12:50] <rhinoboss> duch_kazatel:  i have no fiddle, just asking if its a known/common issue that people have, or if Ive missed something common
[09:13:15] <duch_kazatel> rhinoboss there's no such thing as "a jquery button", so I'm trying to understand what you're talking about,.
[09:13:33] <rhinoboss> a button element with the jquery ui class on it
[09:13:45] <Fishbowne> hmmm
[09:13:47] <rhinoboss> input type button
[09:13:54] <DeliriumTremens> crud
[09:14:00] <duch_kazatel> this is why a fiddle would be helpful, rhinoboss - sounds like you've got something strange happening.
[09:14:07] <rhinoboss> ok ill try to work one up
[09:14:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a text field inside a container, the container launches an event when clicked on. But when I type inside the textbox, and type a space, the event from the container gets triggered. How to avoid this?
[09:14:18] <Fishbowne> hmmm it calling mouseup, its just not exectuing my css changes.
[09:14:23] <Fishbowne> (but works on mobile)
[09:14:36] <jaspertheghost_> $(list).find("#city:not(:Contains(" + filter + "))").parent().slideUp();   is this correct for a div with id=city   ?
[09:14:40] <decx> prevent propagation on the input ecky--ptang-zoob
[09:14:48] <jaspertheghost_> is this the correct way of speicfying city in this seciton of code
[09:14:57] <Fishbowne> (but works on mobile)
[09:15:48] <mephx> hey guys. when body's overflow-y is set to scroll, and some other element's overflow-y is set to scroll, when scrolling inside the element is there a way to prevent scrolling the body when start/end scroll of overflown element has been reached? thanks!
[09:16:03] <Fishbowne> hmmm... any idea why right mouse button would allow mouseup to call its function but left doesn't ?
[09:16:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's not working decx (
[09:16:24] <Fishbowne> center button works too... just not left.
[09:16:28] <decx> jaspertheghost looks like you have several containers with the #city id that'S invalid
[09:16:52] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: Why are you using JS like that? Just do it all in CSS.
[09:16:58] <DeltaHeavy> It's easier, and better.
[09:16:58] <decx> ecky--ptang-zoob fiddle up
[09:17:24] <Fishbowne> Hmmm well fair enough Delta, but lets say I WANT To do it Jquery becaue I can
[09:17:30] <DeltaHeavy> Then you're bad
[09:17:35] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne that's terrible reasoning :)
[09:17:45] <duch_kazatel> separations of concern and all that.
[09:17:48] <Fishbowne> Great Im a terrible person.
[09:17:52] <Fishbowne> I can live with that.
[09:18:10] <Fishbowne> but can seomeone explain why the middle and rigt mouse buttons trigger fine, as does mobile, but left buttons dont
[09:18:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx: doesn't eventpropagation only work on events?
[09:18:15] <DeltaHeavy> If you have no willingness to improve and insist on doing things in a way you know are bad, I'm not going to waste your time on you :p
[09:18:21] <decx> everything looks like a nail :(
[09:18:38] <Fishbowne> So im bad but Jquery LETS you do these things.
[09:18:39] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:18:50] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne that doesn't mean it's the right tool for the job.
[09:18:59] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: Yeah, you can do almost anything in JS including writing the entire HTML document.
[09:19:07] <DeltaHeavy> But if you did that you'd have to be an idiot.
[09:19:08] <duch_kazatel> you're munging separations of concern.  if what you're trying to do seems really odd/awkward, there's probably a good reason.
[09:19:15] <DeltaHeavy> Can !== Should
[09:19:42] <Fishbowne> Still doesn't explain why left mouse button doesn't let the mouseup css commands execute.
[09:19:50] <Fishbowne> while middle button, right button all do
[09:19:55] <Fishbowne> even touch screens works fine
[09:19:57] <DeltaHeavy> Just because you can get around by laying on your stomach and dragging yourself along with your hands, doesn't mean that's the way you should be getting around. Programming languages don't babysit you.
[09:21:59] <Fishbowne> but apparently #jquery on IRC Does.
[09:22:21] <duch_kazatel> we're trying to help you develop good habits mano.
[09:22:31] <Fishbowne> ltes jst pretend that Im coding the right way... any idea why the left button doesnt work the same as the middle and right ?
[09:22:35] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, if you can't be bothered to help yourself I can't be bothered to help you.
[09:23:05] <Fishbowne> well basically you are telling me how to code instead of offering a real suggestion as to why its not working consistently.
[09:23:23] <duch_kazatel> we're telling you that the way you're trying to solve the problem is wrong ;)
[09:23:47] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: How can I get 'this' to become the value of what was actually clicked on, instead of 'body' in my event?
[09:23:52] <Fishbowne> how is it wrong when it allows for it.
[09:23:59] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: Switch careers
[09:24:12] <Fishbowne> Wow now career advice.
[09:24:13] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne you're munging separations of concern: http://jsfiddle.net/v6CuK/
[09:24:25] <duch_kazatel> this works just fine - mouseup handler on all three buttons.
[09:24:31] <duch_kazatel> so there is an issue with something you're doing.
[09:24:49] <Fishbowne> everything except an answer.
[09:24:56] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne i just showed you that it works.
[09:25:06] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code it's impossible to help you at this point.
[09:25:24] <duch_kazatel> you're being combative and refusing to take advice.
[09:26:39] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy check out the e.target object within the handler and use that instead of `this`
[09:26:41] <Fishbowne> Right okay I will post code then on jsfiddle.
[09:27:46] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: It worked, thanks!
[09:27:51] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy sure.
[09:27:57] <Fishbowne> http://jsfiddle.net/heckman13/h55w8/
[09:28:09] <Fishbowne> works with everythign EXCEPT left mouse clicks for me
[09:28:13] <duch_kazatel> Fishy use .on()
[09:28:16] <duch_kazatel> err, Fishbowne
[09:28:41] <Fishbowne> you mean .on("Mouseup" etc
[09:28:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/n7A5d/ - Unfortunately it doens't happen here when I type a space :-/
[09:28:47] <duch_kazatel> $('#button1').on('mousedown', function() {});, $('#button1').on('mouseup', function() {});
[09:29:00] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: Even if you were to apply CSS via jQuery, it's best to add/remove CSS classes rather than use .css(). Honsetly css() should almost never be used.
[09:30:05] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne yeah in this particular case you should really consider adding/removing classes instead of setting specific css.
[09:30:24] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using, btw?
[09:30:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in my situation the container click event gets triggered
[09:31:07] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob you probably need to e.stopImmediatePropagation()
[09:31:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> on what event?
[09:31:34] <Fishbowne> .on does the same thing... its as if the left button is acting like click instead of mousedown
[09:31:43] <Fishbowne> when I use .click the middle and right button act like the left
[09:31:44] <DeltaHeavy> Fishbowne: So much easier to do the CSS - http://jsfiddle.net/h55w8/1/
[09:31:46] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne you're confused about events.
[09:32:02] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_mouse.html - read up here
[09:32:23] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob whichever one is triggerin the click on the parent that you don't want.
[09:32:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> keypress then?
[09:32:48] <duch_kazatel> keypress shouldn't be triggering a click event handler.
[09:32:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $("#edit-gimmick").on("keypress", function(e) {
[09:32:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob>         e.stopImmediatePropagation();
[09:32:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob>     });
[09:33:03] <intellix> how can I……. $(‘::after’, this); sort of thing?
[09:33:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it triggers the container click event when I type a space in the input
[09:33:43] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob that's not happening for me.
[09:34:12] <duch_kazatel> intellilogic you want the element after $(this)?
[09:34:13] <BillCriswell> intellix: You can't.
[09:34:22] <intellix> ok so, go to the parent, then go back lookign for it
[09:34:22] <duch_kazatel> woops, intellix
[09:34:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I assumed the pseudo element.
[09:34:37] <duch_kazatel> intellix what are you trying to select?
[09:34:41] <intellix> like say:
[09:34:47] <intellix> .blah::after
[09:34:51] <BillCriswell> Boom.
[09:34:53] <intellix> I want the ::after, using the .blah
[09:34:54] <duch_kazatel> you want the psuedo element?
[09:34:57] <intellix> yep
[09:35:01] <decx> pseudo elements arent part of the dom
[09:35:08] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: event.target is ALWAYS selecting the <select> rather than the option. Any idea as to why? - $('body').live('click', 'select[id^="order_action_"] option', function (event) {
[09:35:15] <intellix> ah, and I can’t even get it anyway then, to apply stlyes etc?
[09:35:21] <intellix> feel like a noob for even asking then :P
[09:35:26] <duch_kazatel> intellix you can only access it via css iirc.
[09:35:31] <decx> you can inject into document stylesheet
[09:35:48] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy no clue, but using "id starts with" attribute selectors is always a painful thing.
[09:35:50] <BillCriswell> Would propbably be easier to just change the class on the element.
[09:35:52] <intellix> does jQuery already handle that?
[09:35:58] <intellix> ah yes, I suppose so
[09:36:07] <intellix> but I need a fine-tuned width applying
[09:36:20] <intellix> so I suppose ::after is not good, need some extra DOM to achieve this
[09:36:40] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Doesn't look like .live() takes a second parameter selector like that.
[09:37:10] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:37:11] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah, DeltaHeavy you want $('select[id^="order_action_"] option').live('click', function (event) {
[09:37:16] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: How should it look? I'm already on that page
[09:37:26] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy just showed you.
[09:37:30] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: The 'select' doesn't exist on initial page load.
[09:37:39] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Saw that only a second before I hit enter :p
[09:37:41] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy right - .live binds the listener to the body for you.
[09:37:45] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: It doesn't matter.
[09:37:47] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, I see.
[09:37:50] <DeltaHeavy> Lemme try it. Tanks!
[09:37:51] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks*
[09:37:53] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy .live() is different than .delegate()
[09:38:40] <DeltaHeavy> Now it's not working at all.
[09:38:42] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: I'd also be extra sure option elements get the click events.
[09:39:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> duch_kazatel: I noticed it's a bootstrap dropdown button, the parent container... so it's the dropdown that gets triggered
[09:39:07] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I already have an if statement in there checking the value.
[09:39:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> any way to disable this?
[09:39:27] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy you should be binding to the change event on the select, not the click of the option.
[09:40:10] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: $('select[id^="order_action_"] option').live('change', function (event) {
[09:40:10] <DeltaHeavy>         ?
[09:40:16] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob not sure - you could try stopImmediatePropagation(); on the keypress event.
[09:40:19] <BillCriswell> Select, not the option.
[09:40:22] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy oin the select, not the option.
[09:40:34] <Fishbowne> okay I recognize I need to use CSS, but still not sure why the mouseup mousedown thing is so convoluted or why its 'in there' if theres no use for it
[09:40:48] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne there are tons of uses for it.
[09:40:54] <Fishbowne> just not for the one I need.
[09:41:10] <duch_kazatel> it's broken on yours for some reason - can you create a fiddle that replicates the problem?
[09:41:23] <Fishbowne> well duch I did. its here.
[09:41:32] <Fishbowne> http://jsfiddle.net/h55w8/1/
[09:41:33] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne no, you did not.  you shared some code.
[09:41:51] <duch_kazatel> this is not a functioning fiddle.
[09:41:53] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Doesn't work. I originally had that but I think this drop down menu has some janky JS attached to it.
[09:41:57] <Fishbowne> I see.
[09:42:11] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy hrm?
[09:42:18] <Fishbowne> wow not sure how complicated that will be there some AJAX calls etc... using an HTML boilerplate template etc.
[09:42:24] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: The value of the <select> doesn't ever change.
[09:42:37] <Fishbowne> how about I just send you the link of where the page is ?
[09:42:43] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne ... http://jsfiddle.net/h55w8/2/
[09:42:48] <jaspertheghost_> : i have  <header><row><row><row>  given need to grab the header which has a class of header with a before selector in jquery how can i do so ... so that when im in say the last <row> i can grtab the header column directly before it
[09:42:53] <jaspertheghost_> : or in this case several elements up from the last row
[09:42:56] <Fishbowne> http://www.hatboxgames.com/tv/indexmob.html
[09:43:03] <duch_kazatel> i give up with you dude.  you're being a wiseass Fishbowne.  i'm not going to your site.
[09:43:14] <duch_kazatel> Fishbowne do you have something stopping propagation.
[09:43:15] <Fishbowne> how am I a wise ass here ?
[09:43:23] <Fishbowne> duch no. not that I know of.
[09:43:28] <Fishbowne> nothing other than mouseup
[09:43:41] <jaspertheghost_> will .prev do that?
[09:43:45] <Fishbowne> is that what i need to do, stop the click event from firgin ?
[09:43:52] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: Get's the element before.
[09:44:42] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: $('li').eq(1).prev() would give you the first `<li>`.
[09:44:56] <decx> wat
[09:45:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Seemed like a logical example for prev() haha.
[09:45:20] <decx> this is even better than $(this)[0]
[09:45:36] <BillCriswell> decx: Say what?
[09:45:37] <Fishbowne> tha fixed it thanks
[09:45:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you ever get your comcast issues figured out btw?
[09:46:00] <str8uplinux> I'm trying to figure out a way to iterate through each table COLUMN under each table header select list to make sure at least one field below it has a value. Any help is appreciated.... http://jsfiddle.net/twmQn/2/
[09:46:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ha, nope, going to try again tonight. I just think something is up with my router.
[09:46:24] <decx> southpark_nipple.gif
[09:46:33] <jaspertheghost_> thanks, one more stupid qurstion    given with ternary operator line ->  (text.indexOf(valThis) > -1) ? $(this).show() : $(this).hide();       it says $($this).show i would like to run one more "command along withit" whats the proper way to do that there ...
[09:46:55] <TheEternalAbyss> ok why the heck did my client highlight that
[09:47:16] <decx> you chain it jaspertheghost
[09:47:24] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i've only had one issue in recent memory and they just swapped the modem.  got me a free package upgrade since they'd rolled out docsis 3
[09:48:13] <BillCriswell> Haha nice.
[09:48:29] <BillCriswell> I only have internet with comcast. I refuse to pay for cable.
[09:48:49] <duch_kazatel> we only bundle because it winds up being $5 a month more for us to have basic cable.
[09:49:35] <BillCriswell> I was in the same boat. It still felt good to just get rid of it.
[09:49:42] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet.,
[09:50:00] <duch_kazatel> i need to setup a mediabox and/or just get a chromecast.
[09:50:06] <BillCriswell> There's like... 1,000s of channels, at any time there might be 1 thing on worth watching.
[09:50:32] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell we have super basic cable, so we get less than 100.  people think we're weird.
[09:50:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I have two Apple TVs, plus Netflix, Hulu and HBOGO.
[09:50:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah we do netflix.
[09:50:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha it's a start!
[09:50:57] <decx> 1000 channels and one thing wort h watching? sounds like haggard internet
[09:51:10] <jaspertheghost_> decx .. could you give me an example of chaining this way?
[09:51:18] <decx> no
[09:51:29] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost $(this).show().text('a butt');
[09:51:32] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[09:51:34] <decx> $('selector').yes().maybe().no()
[09:52:27] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost also, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[09:52:46] <duch_kazatel> this shows you how to break things up so you can do multiple operations.
[09:52:58] <BillCriswell> yes().no().maybe().iDontKNow().repeat() ?
[09:53:22] <jaspertheghost_> i want to use another selector
[09:53:32] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost then read the link I just paste.
[09:53:34] <duch_kazatel> *pasted.
[09:53:45] <decx> parathesis this
[09:53:45] <duch_kazatel> or use an if statement instead.
[09:53:50] <decx> paranthesis
[09:53:58] <decx> yes
[09:54:16] <jaspertheghost_> i can use a comma looks like
[09:54:37] <decx> or short circuit

[09:54:49] <duch_kazatel> use whitespace.
[09:54:59] <duch_kazatel> newlines are an okay thing.
[09:55:27] <BillCriswell> No reason to keep that on one line.
[09:55:42] <jaspertheghost_> yea .. i just keep it one line so that i dont spam the room
[09:56:00] <duch_kazatel> that's why we encourage using things like fixee ;)
[09:56:27] <jaspertheghost_> link?
[09:56:37] <duch_kazatel> why use a ternary here at all though?  instead of a plain ol' if/else?
[09:56:52] <duch_kazatel> http://fixee.org/
[09:57:18] <jaspertheghost_> was curious
[09:58:24] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to give up redbull... again.
[09:58:27] <BillCriswell> It is not going well.
[09:59:05] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell good luck.  i give myself energy drinks and booze as my final vices these days.
[09:59:27] <IgorHerson> someone can help me?
[09:59:33] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ IgorHerson
[09:59:34] <b-ot> IgorHerson: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:59:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I've limited myself to drinking once a week.
[10:00:01] <decx> i had one sip of redbull in 1995, it was the first and last time i ever drank an energy drink
[10:00:26] <BillCriswell> decx: I don't even know if I like the taste. I just... want the taste.
[10:00:39] <decx> good old addiction
[10:00:48] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell yeah it's the way the caffeine works in your brain.  it's addictive stuff.
[10:01:16] <duch_kazatel> keep pressing that adrenal gland, then you stop all of the sudden.  there's a reason you feel like butt.
[10:01:22] <decx> i only drink water and the occasional hard liquor
[10:01:31] <decx> and milk of course
[10:01:34] <BillCriswell> I bought a case of sprite and I'm trying to ease myself off of redbull with it.
[10:01:42] <BillCriswell> decx: I used to drink so much milk.
[10:02:03] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you can also do plain old club soda.  i found that helped me stop drinking so much damn soda all the time.
[10:02:10] <BillCriswell> I grew up on whole milk drinking multiple glasses a day, 2% nowadays.. only in cereal, though.
[10:02:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure I ever tried plain club soda.
[10:02:34] <duch_kazatel> the carbonation does a helluva lot.
[10:02:59] <duch_kazatel> i usually have it on hand for mojitos or whisky and soda.
[10:03:14] <cereal> BillCriswell, cereal is the shit
[10:03:21] <BillCriswell> cereal: Hahaha
[10:03:23] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[10:03:38] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I can't do the hard liquor.
[10:03:45] <IgorHerson> I have an event to an object "a" within the function for this event, I want to redeem a given object within this "a" as an "img", but do not know how to do that, like a "this + 'img'", but I believe this does not work
[10:03:52] <duch_kazatel> oh man i love bourbon and scotch.
[10:04:01] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ IgorHerson
[10:04:01] <b-ot> IgorHerson: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:04:08] <BillCriswell> I read it's a total myth that different types of alcohol get you to behave in different ways but I don't like myself drinking liquor.
[10:04:15] <decx> $(this).find('img')
[10:04:44] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell it is a myth imo.  i'm as much of a jackass with vodka as i am with whisky.
[10:04:58] <duch_kazatel> i just had to learn moderation.
[10:06:04] <BillCriswell> When I'm in drinking mode it's hard for me to pause. Luckily I don't get like that often.
[10:06:37] <IgorHerson> decx: nice, works =D thanks
[10:11:26] <LoneStar99> would I be able to use jquery to search json resultset for say "chinese food" and only display those results?
[10:11:40] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 why not use javascript?
[10:11:51] <LoneStar99> or javascript,
[10:12:02] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: you have a good link for that?
[10:12:15] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.  that's easy.  dpeends on what you mean by "search json resultset".  do you have a sample?
[10:12:40] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: $.grep() would be a cross browser function to look into.
[10:13:10] <BillCriswell> Well... it's jQuery, but it's safer than using .filter() probably.
[10:13:27] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: not yet perhaps by tonight, accessing data from 3rd party api, and need to display only results which are relevant to keywords etc...
[10:13:33] <BillCriswell> Ah, filter is ie9+
[10:13:44] <jaspertheghost_> <header 1><row><row><header 2><row><row B><header 3><row><row X> from row X i would like to return header 3 from from B i would like to return heafer 2  ? how would i do this in jquery?
[10:13:57] <jaspertheghost_> jquery /css selector *
[10:14:13] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost what is "header 2"?
[10:14:26] <jaspertheghost_> class = header
[10:14:35] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: .prevAll('.header').eq(0) maybe?
[10:14:37] <jaspertheghost_> otherwise there all <li> elements
[10:14:52] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: A demo with some HTML would be useful here.
[10:16:21] <jaspertheghost_> http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:16:28] <BillCriswell> Need to click "Share"

[10:17:17] <SyBr> Hey, since the last update of jQuery (2.1.1) I'm getting an awful lot of warnings in the firebug console.
[10:17:26] <LoneStar99> thanks guys, will be on later tonight with some working code
[10:17:38] <SyBr> For one: SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
[10:17:38] <SyBr>  
[10:17:38] <SyBr> ...length;b++)if(d=a[b])/@import|[{}]/.test(d)?e.push("<style>"+d+"</style>"):e.pu
[10:18:03] <SyBr> Anybody with the same problem?
[10:18:54] <LoneStar99> have a great day!
[10:19:40] <duch_kazatel> SyBr sounds like your code was doing thigns in ways it shouldn't.
[10:19:42] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: http://jsfiddle.net/ScT2w/1/
[10:19:55] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: Is what I was thinking.
[10:20:24] <BillCriswell> jaspertheghost_: Though this feels funny. There's probably a better way to structure your HTML.
[10:20:26] <jaspertheghost_> yes thanks
[10:20:38] <SyBr> Yes but the problem is that it's pointing to jquery.js itself!
[10:20:59] <SyBr> So... I think it's not my code... :/
[10:21:11] <duch_kazatel> SyBr that usually means you're calling things wrong.
[10:21:57] <SyBr> Ok and what about another random... warning...
[10:22:16] <duch_kazatel> audit your code - how big of a version jump did you make?
[10:22:27] <SyBr> ReferenceError: reference to undefined property f.valHooks[this]
[10:22:35] <SyBr> ... for instance.
[10:23:07] <BillCriswell> SyBr: do $.fn.jquery and be sure $ is still jQuery.
[10:24:04] <BillCriswell> That should return a number.
[10:24:08] <SyBr> I was using 1.10 and upgraded to 1.11 and then to 2.1.1 (which are equivalent)
[10:24:57] <SyBr> $.fn.jquery
[10:24:57] <SyBr> "2.1.1"
[10:26:46] <BillCriswell> IS it the same across browsers?
[10:28:04] <SyBr> Well, at least my code seems to be working so... hmph the pain is bearable...
[10:30:27] <SyBr> I'm using ckeditor and the console in Chrome outputs just this:
[10:30:33] <SyBr> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'getEditor' of undefined ckeditor.js:313

[10:30:36] <SyBr> completed
[10:31:44] <SyBr> And I think that might be what's causing all the troubles.
[10:34:09] <duch_kazatel> sounds like ckeditor is part of the problem.
[10:34:50] <SyBr> It's working fine though.
[10:35:05] <duch_kazatel> i like to have a clean console personally.
[10:35:16] <duch_kazatel> that way i know of new errors when they arise.
[10:35:24] <duch_kazatel> and i know things are working as they mostly should.
[10:35:25] <SyBr> Oh man me too!
[10:35:44] <duch_kazatel> we have extensive javascript error reporting, so we'd resolve that.
[10:35:58] <SyBr> And this is darn annoying.
[10:36:52] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19089623/ckeditor-geteditor-error
[10:36:55] <duch_kazatel> might help you out.

[10:39:03] <SyBr> (...and spy ¬¬)
[10:39:24] <duch_kazatel> then use DuckDuckGo or another search engine of your choice.

[10:40:52] <SyBr> https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere
[10:41:07] <duch_kazatel> meh
[10:41:14] <duch_kazatel> i simply stay aware of what i'm doing where.
[11:11:11] <duch_kazatel> oh man it's almost lunchtime
[11:21:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What are you getting?
[11:21:36] <duch_kazatel> not sure yet.
[11:24:14] <thebope> I recommend food
[11:24:19] <thebope> but who am I to say
[11:24:42] <drej> food is overrated
[11:24:54] <drej> soylent  > food
[11:25:50] <drej> http://www.soylent.me/
[11:27:52] <PantsOfChoco> you guys so crazy, and yea its almost lunch WEST COOOOAST
[11:28:38] <Getterac7> drej: I was in the Soylent Kickstarter and still haven't got anything yet... did you get yours?
[11:29:10] <drej> i didnt kickstart it
[11:29:15] <drej> but you can order it on their site
[11:29:18] <NoiseEee> i got a new protein breakfast cereal that tastes like i imagine soylent does
[11:29:35] <NoiseEee> its filling and functional but unpleasant
[11:29:51] <NoiseEee> eating soylent to me is like choosing to listen to elevator music
[11:30:15] <Getterac7> I bought a week of Soylent... we'll see how it goes (if I ever get my order).
[11:31:17] <drej> Getterac7 im contemplating the same
[11:33:12] <PantsOfChoco> but like just to try right? cause that sounds like an awful plan to me. food is delicious
[11:35:45] <Getterac7> i have a really poor sense of taste, so I don't really enjoy eating... i just do it because I have to.
[11:36:01] <Getterac7> So Soylent would be perfect for me, as long as the texture is decent.
[11:36:13] <PantsOfChoco> they describe it as watery pancake batter
[11:36:18] <PantsOfChoco> that sounds miserable.
[11:39:28] <Snacks> Soylent Green is coming true! p_submit_ref
[11:39:36] <Snacks> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVpN312hYgU
[11:43:47] <drej> PantsOfChoco well i feel like if i can get 2 meals/day taken care of with soylent
[11:43:53] <drej> and then have a nice dinner every day or something, i would be okay with that
[11:44:07] <drej> breakfast/lunch i dont care much about, im always just eating garbage anyway that i can buy near work
[11:45:19] <andrew9183> drej is in the house
[11:49:27] <andrew9183> interesting about soylent
[11:50:08] <NoiseEee> why not just drink those terrible meal milkshakes right now?
[11:51:29] <andrew9183> drej, wanna split an order
[11:51:46] <andrew9183> NoiseEee: good point
[11:52:19] <PantsOfChoco> yea make a protein shake, or that thing for old people. uhhh ENSURE thats it.
[11:57:48] <drej> andrew9183 i'll get my own thanks :)
[11:57:54] <andrew9183> bastard
[11:57:55] <andrew9183> :D
[11:58:07] <drej> NoiseEee because its not the same, the soylent stuff is engineered to be a meal replacement
[11:58:11] <drej> the shakes are usually suppliments

[12:01:21] <sweet2k4> guys, i have a varibale declared in a php file like this . var url = <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> . '/images/2-packvit.png'; how do i accses it from an external js script  in a external js file?
[12:03:01] <drej> andrew9183 WELL THAT LOOKS DELIVIOUS
[12:03:02] <drej> C
[12:03:42] <andrew9183> sweet2k4 have it declared to the window in your html and use your js to get it ?
[12:03:43] <drej> i mean its got 3 grams of Choline Bitartrate
[12:03:47] <drej> so it cant be bad
[12:04:04] <andrew9183> drej: we're gonna get flooded
[12:04:05] <andrew9183> again.
[12:04:16] <drej> i know :( its fucking pouring out
[12:04:20] <drej> so glad i drove the 1km to work
[12:06:08] <sweet2k4> andrew9183: im not quite sure how to do that, im quite new to this
[12:06:16] <sweet2k4> andrew9183: window.varname?
[12:08:06] <sweet2k4> andrew9183: something like this? window.url = <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> . '/images/2-packvit.png'; or how would i declare it?
[12:08:30] <ezio> how can i extend a structure into a new variable without affecting the source?
[12:09:47] <andrew9183> something like that, look it up
[12:10:12] <andrew9183> what do you mean extend a structure into a new variable
[12:10:19] <andrew9183> if its a new variable, just declare it with the structure ?
[12:17:30] <Njuih> http://jsfiddle.net/Hms9J/42/
[12:17:37] <Njuih> why doesn't works
[12:21:12] <sweet2k4> is there something wrong with this cant figure out why it doesnt work...: window.url = <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> + '/images/2-packvit.png';
[12:21:59] <sweet2k4> <script type="text/javascript"> window.url = <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> + '/images/2-packvit.png'; </script>
[12:22:46] <duch_lunch> sweet2k4 what does <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> output?
[12:23:27] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: it iputs a url
[12:23:36] <sweet2k4> outputs
[12:25:34] <duch_kazatel> okay - what do you expect that code to do?
[12:26:34] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: i need to accses that variable from an external js file
[12:27:09] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: since i cant parse php in the js file
[12:29:24] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: maybe the problem is where i accses it: $2pack.attr('src', window.url).fadeIn("slow");
[12:29:33] <duch_kazatel> don't use .attr()
[12:29:35] <duch_kazatel> use .prop()
[12:30:12] <sweet2k4> hmm ok, how is the full syntax? just switch .attr to .prop?
[12:30:16] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:30:22] <sweet2k4> okey, il try
[12:30:39] <duch_kazatel> use .prop() insted of .attr() all the time, regardless.
[12:30:40] <sweet2k4> whats the diffirenace?
[12:30:59] <duch_kazatel> one accesses markup, the other accesses the actual DOM.
[12:31:37] <sweet2k4> ok
[12:33:29] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: still doesnt work, i can accses window.url in jquery even if i use this syntaxs when i declare it right? <script type="text/javascript">window.url = <?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?> + '/images/2-packvit.png'; </script>
[12:34:10] <duch_kazatel> you mean in javascript.  right before that .prop(), do console.log(window.url); - what do you get?
[12:34:37] <sweet2k4> and the concantenate for js is the + sign right?
[12:34:50] <duch_kazatel> correct, concat in JS is +
[12:34:55] <duch_kazatel> do the console log.
[12:35:08] <sweet2k4> one sec
[12:35:29] <decx> why have the directory dynamic when you just hardcode one image
[12:35:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm thinking the same thing.
[12:36:25] <sweet2k4> decx: its wordpress that needs it
[12:36:30] <duch_kazatel> why?
[12:36:41] <duch_kazatel> just needs a relative URL, right?
[12:37:08] <decx> it's always going to be /wp-content/themes/mytheme/ anyway
[12:37:35] <sweet2k4> so i just change the url to the full url?
[12:37:56] <sweet2k4> soo what folder would be the root?
[12:38:02] <decx> if you know your themename you don't need the dynamic var
[12:38:19] <sweet2k4> that would make life so much esier
[12:38:30] <sweet2k4> well i do know my themename
[12:38:31] <decx> leading / in a url means it's relative to the root of the domain
[12:38:56] <decx> so href="/blah" always leads to http://mydomain.com/blah
[12:39:47] <sweet2k4> okey so /wp-content/themes/fixclip/images
[12:39:56] <sweet2k4> would be the correct url?
[12:40:04] <duch_kazatel> Did You Try?(tm)
[12:40:24] <sweet2k4> need to rewrite some code, one sec.
[12:40:46] <duch_kazatel> you could always directly access the url instead.
[12:42:15] <sweet2k4> omg it worked! i thought wordpress had some silly things going on that it wouldnt work
[12:42:41] <sweet2k4> decx: thx a lot, you saved me a couple of hours
[12:42:48] <duch_kazatel> to paraphrase freud, "a url is just a url"
[12:42:58] <sweet2k4> hehe
[12:43:42] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: anyways i kind of new to this but where would i red the consol.log you suggested before, i think its good to know for the future
[12:43:51] <sweet2k4> read
[12:44:18] <duch_kazatel> the console.
[12:44:23] <duch_kazatel> what browser are you using?
[12:44:29] <sweet2k4> firefox
[12:44:41] <duch_kazatel> hit f12
[12:45:07] <duch_kazatel> see that new window that opened?
[12:45:20] <duch_kazatel> you can get all kinds of info from there - console.log() outputs to there.
[12:45:50] <sweet2k4> okey nice, under the js tab?
[12:47:11] <duch_kazatel> under the "console" tab.  there are buttons to toggle what it shows.  you want "Logging" enabled, at least.
[12:48:00] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/3W2dYqJ.png I usually leave just "JS" and "Logging" on.  the rest can be helpful, too.
[12:48:24] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: thx
[12:48:51] <sweet2k4> the output before was "undefined"
[12:49:16] <duch_kazatel> that means you were trying to use the var before you declared it.
[12:50:37] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: ahh makes sens, i imported the external js before declaring this var. how stupid :)
[12:51:43] <duch_kazatel> did your external stuff wait for document ready?
[12:52:11] <sweet2k4> nope
[12:52:20] <duch_kazatel> that'd do it.
[12:53:30] <sudormf> Is there any good plugin which will fire a callback when a particular dom element is in the view port?
[12:53:38] <sweet2k4> alright, so i put this in a document ready function <script src="<?php bloginfo( 'stylesheet_directory'  ); ?>/js/index.js"></script>
[12:54:11] <duch_kazatel> sweet2k4 wat
[12:54:44] <duch_kazatel> sudormf no need for a plugin - search google - tons of tutorials.
[12:54:52] <duch_kazatel> sweet2k4 that's html, not js
[12:55:04] <sudormf> duch_kazatel: i don't have time to follow a tutorial
[12:55:07] <sudormf> on deadline
[12:55:13] <duch_kazatel> oh okay.  enjoy then.
[12:55:29] <sudormf> Anyone else know of any plugin which will fire a callback when a particular dom element is in the view port?
[12:55:59] <sweet2k4> duch_kazatel: nvm, im a bit to tierd to think straight. my problem solved so i have to move on, il deal with this an other time. thank you for you help tho. allways nice with peope like you :)

[12:58:33] <duch_kazatel> i guess i really am blessed at my job - I can take the time to do things right and learn new stuff when I need to.
[12:59:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Definitely a luxury.
[12:59:10] <BillCriswell> I'm pretty lucky here with that, but it wasn't always the case.
[12:59:18] <BillCriswell> You learn a lot in both situations though.
[12:59:22] <decx> the football is starting up again
[12:59:25] <decx> it
[12:59:27] <duch_kazatel> like, we've had crunch times here, but they know you can't rush things sometimes.
[12:59:44] <duch_kazatel> my last place was pretty bad about expectation management.
[12:59:45] <BillCriswell> Oh yeah world cup.
[12:59:52] <duch_kazatel> germany vs. brazil.
[12:59:55] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha, hear that.
[12:59:55] <sudormf> can there be multiple methods set for window.onscroll? i already have a window.onscroll event handler set. Can I add a new one without clearing the older one?
[13:00:14] <duch_kazatel> sudormf jquery events exist in a different world to javascript events.
[13:00:19] <duch_kazatel> so yes.
[13:00:27] <duch_kazatel> i've got a brazilian coworker who's stoked about today's game.
[13:00:33] <NoiseEee> obv
[13:00:42] <sudormf> duch_kazatel:  isn't jquery calling window.onscroll behind the scenes
[13:00:43] <duch_kazatel> though they're down their top 2 players.
[13:00:48] <duch_kazatel> sudormf nope.
[13:00:57] <duch_kazatel> sudormf well, not really :)
[13:00:59] <sudormf> then how does it know when page scrolls?
[13:01:11] <duch_kazatel> i thought you didn't have time for this!?
[13:01:24] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[13:03:12] <duch_kazatel> relevant code here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L766
[13:04:08] <duch_kazatel> either way, no you will not overwrite your inline handler.
[13:15:58] <duch_kazatel> i love days when I can get some solid, uninterrupted coding in.
[13:18:35] <drej> duch_kazatel ditto
[13:18:48] <drej> i mean, id like to not do any more coding ever in my life, but since i have to, i like productive days :)
[13:18:59] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[13:24:55] <ezio> omg
[13:25:03] <ezio> is anyone watching the brazil/germany match?
[13:25:47] <Rubas_> Hi I wish to use JQuery / Ajax to add items to my cart without refreshing page, does anyone have any examples to this?
[13:26:10] <BillCriswell> decx: Are you shitting your pants right now?
[13:27:03] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[13:27:17] <BillCriswell> germany is destroying brazil
[13:27:45] <duch_kazatel> holy fuck 4-nil?!
[13:27:53] <Rubas_> WTF
[13:27:57] <NoiseEee> like 3 goals in 2 minutes of play
[13:27:58] <BillCriswell> Last I checked.
[13:28:02] <NoiseEee> ridiculous
[13:28:09] <Rubas_> 22 min only? O.o
[13:28:17] <duch_kazatel> 28'
[13:28:19] <Rubas_> 27*
[13:28:22] <Rubas_> 29*
[13:28:23] <Rubas_> 28**
[13:28:23] <duch_kazatel> this will not be a repeat of '62 it looks like.
[13:30:29] <BillCriswell> The only reason I knew sports were even going on is because of twitter.
[13:30:34] <BillCriswell> Ouch, 5.
[13:30:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:30:41] <duch_kazatel> i have obsessed coworkers.
[13:32:12] <BillCriswell> "did america win the world cup yet"
[13:32:15] <BillCriswell> I love beep.
[13:34:32] <duch_kazatel> hahaha that's awesome.
[13:35:25] <BillCriswell> I'm not making it to 5. Good afternoon, all!
[13:35:25] <duch_kazatel> <insert joke here about america intervening because germany blah blah blah>
[13:35:34] <duch_kazatel> enjoy cap'n
[13:43:03] <EminenceHC> I am dynamically creating values. The id of these follow a pattern of: daily_time_card_tasks_attributes_0_spent, daily_time_card_tasks_attributes_1_spent, etc. How would I go about summing up all these values into one variable?
[13:43:28] <duch_kazatel> why not use data attributes to store that data?
[13:45:23] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Not familiar with data attributes, Ill go look into it. Thanks
[13:45:33] <NoiseEee> EminenceHC: that seems pretty clunky in general
[13:46:07] <NoiseEee> daily_time_cards = {0:someValue,1:someOtherValue}
[13:46:26] <NoiseEee> or into an array, but wordy variables are confusing/not ideal
[13:46:42] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC do .data('timeCardTasksSpent', 0);
[13:47:25] <duch_kazatel> or store data elsewhere.
[13:55:34] <Rubas_> Is it best to send jquery/ajax POST or GET request?
[13:56:01] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Would I have to do .data('timeCardTasksSpent', 0); .data('timeCardTasksSpent', 1); etc?
[13:56:46] <Snacks> Rubas_: GET is basically used for just getting (retrieving) some data from the server. Note: The GET method may return cached data. POST can also be used to get some data from the server. However, the POST method NEVER caches data, and is often used to send data along with the request.
[13:57:08] <Rubas_> Snacks: Thanks for letting me know that! :)
[13:57:30] <Snacks> np
[13:57:37] <DeliriumTremens> i've got a click event that seems to be firing without ever clicking the element... $('#projectedEarnings').click(uploadImage(imgData.substr(22)));
[13:58:03] <DeliriumTremens> the uploadImage function is being called without clicking the div
[13:58:07] <rhizome> i'm using a plugin (qtip2) that seems (seems!) to only want to process a specified selector from the first container on a page. is something like $(document).filter('a.word') a decent way of forcing a list of everything to be passed as an argument?
[13:58:46] <duch_kazatel> DeliriumTremens because you just put the function name in there.
[13:58:48] <rhizome> DeliriumTremens: .on('click', 'selector', function...)
[13:58:53] <duch_kazatel> $('#projectedEarnings').click(uploadImage));
[13:59:10] <duch_kazatel> err $('#projectedEarnings').click(uploadImage); - the () is automatically inserted for you.
[13:59:36] <DeliriumTremens> d'oh
[13:59:53] <duch_kazatel> because of how jquery does its binding magic, what you're doing is running the function and binding the returned object.
[14:00:17] <DeliriumTremens> gotcha, only a couple days into js/jquery, it's a lot to wrap my head around
[14:00:19] <DeliriumTremens> thanks guys
[14:00:45] <duch_kazatel> if you need to pass in extra data, you can do $('#projectedEarnings').on('click', {imgData.substr(22)}, uploadimage);
[14:00:50] <duch_kazatel> check out the docs for .on()
[14:02:55] <rhizome> hmm, filter nor find is working. drawing board.
[14:03:20] <duch_kazatel> rhizome what now?
[14:04:53] <decx> duch_kazatel your coworker from brazil will need support in these trying times
[14:05:05] <duch_kazatel> she looks pretty upset actuall.
[14:05:25] <decx> well germany shot 5 goals in 18 minutes
[14:05:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah i saw that.
[14:06:25] <duch_kazatel> pretty batty stuff.
[14:16:44] <DeliriumTremens> that worked perfectly duch_kazatel, much thanks
[14:17:02] <duch_kazatel> .on() is good stuff.
[14:22:58] <rhizome> i'm using .on('action', 'selector', thingToDo(event))...what is event and how does it relate to a 'this' for my function purposes?
[14:23:14] <rhizome> big hole in my jq understanding here
[14:24:00] <duch_kazatel> rhizome event would be the first arg.
[14:24:06] <duch_kazatel> that's the event that was triggerent.
[14:24:16] <duch_kazatel> oh the event object.
[14:25:40] <rhizome> i'm moving from thingToDo($(selector)) where the function did a selector.each and gave me a $(this) to use
[14:26:01] <duch_kazatel> jquery actually binds 'this' to either the element you're bound to (the selector you run .on() against) or if you're using a delegated listener 'this' is the element that the event came from.
[14:26:24] <rhizome> i don't think i'm using a delegated listener, at least not intentionally
[14:26:34] <duch_kazatel> you're using  .on('action', 'selector', thingToDo(event)) ?
[14:26:39] <rhizome> yes
[14:26:44] <duch_kazatel> that's a delegated listener :)
[14:26:48] <rhizome> $(document).on(...)
[14:26:54] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('action', 'selector', thingToDo(event)) ?
[14:26:58] <duch_kazatel> that's a delegated listener.
[14:26:58] <rhizome> yes
[14:27:01] <rhizome> ok :)
[14:27:16] <duch_kazatel> if you pass a second arg to .on() that's a selector, you're using a delegated listener.
[14:27:30] <duch_kazatel> btw your binding should just be $(document).on('action', 'selector', thingToDo);
[14:27:42] <duch_kazatel> the event object is passed automatically.
[14:27:43] <rhizome> oh, so i don't need to worry about event?
[14:27:50] <duch_kazatel> it's all ready passed for you.
[14:27:52] <rhizome> and i'll have an implicit this?
[14:27:57] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[14:28:00] <rhizome> swank. thanks!
[14:28:41] <duch_kazatel> in that case, $(this) is the element that "action" came from.  so if you did $(document).on('change', 'select', thingToDo), $(this) would be the select that the change came from.
[14:29:26] <rhizome> and if it's an a href, it will be that element?
[14:29:40] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:30:16] <duch_kazatel> that would be $(document).on(click', 'a, thingToDo) - in that case, yes.  $(this) would be the clicked anchor.
[14:30:25] <rhizome> just thinking out loud. ah, thanks.
[14:30:44] <rhizome> probably a common question, but what's the difference between $(this) and this?
[14:31:05] <duch_kazatel> '$(this)' is the jquery-fied version of 'this'
[14:31:12] <duch_kazatel> so you can run jquery methods against that element.
[14:32:50] <rhizome> i see. 'this' will never exist already jquerified?
[14:32:56] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[14:33:01] <rhizome> great, thanks
[14:38:43] <duch_kazatel> this game...
[14:38:56] <duch_kazatel> not even watchingit myself, just seeing the results on google.
[14:40:40] <rhizome> hmm, it seems that adding an event argument to the function, which appears to be required for the plugin to operate properly, changes 'this'
[14:40:57] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:41:02] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing your code on jsfiddle?
[14:41:23] <rhizome> i can try. it's coffeescript generally
[14:41:30] <duch_kazatel> D:
[14:41:39] <duch_kazatel> let me show you.
[14:42:46] <rhizome> when i change it to thingToDo(event), $(this) is logged as: [Object, jquery: "1.11.0", constructor: function, selector: "", toArray: function, get: function…]
[14:42:57] <rhizome>  before, it was the element itself
[14:43:06] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/F9FR8/
[14:43:22] <duch_kazatel> this is what you nee.d
[14:44:53] <duch_kazatel> make sense?
[14:46:50] <rhizome> yeah, it's just that when i do it that way the plugin doesn't fire until the second event
[14:47:12] <duch_kazatel> what's the plugin?
[14:47:16] <rhizome> qtip2
[14:48:00] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[14:48:03] <rhizome> and believe me, i'm a bit mortified coming from rails and knowing what it's like when people ask "derp can't get plugin to work"
[14:49:17] <rhizome> germane qtip2 docs: http://qtip2.com/guides#events.delegation
[14:49:24] <rhizome> afaict
[14:49:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah you're munging concepts.
[14:49:44] <duch_kazatel> that uses an inline handler.
[14:50:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/F9FR8/2/
[14:50:48] <duch_kazatel> err, not inline, but you know what I mean.
[14:51:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/F9FR8/3/
[14:51:23] <duch_kazatel> see this
[14:54:36] <rhizome> i'm not sure why the inline function gets event and a named one doesn't, or how to get the event.type as a function argument
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> the inline declaration needs you to name it.
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/F9FR8/4/
[14:55:00] <rhizome> i'm guessing $(this).type isn't going to be a valid substitution
[14:55:03] <duch_kazatel> with the named function expression.
[14:55:07] <duch_kazatel> you want event.type?
[14:55:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/F9FR8/5/
[14:55:34] <rhizome> yeah, see the qtip config, event: event.type
[14:55:52] <rhizome> i have a sinking feeling this is going to be a global scope thing that i didn't consider
[14:55:54] <duch_kazatel> right - which is the same as the one I'm console logging.
[14:55:56] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:56:02] <duch_kazatel> this is all scoped to the function,
[14:56:11] <duch_kazatel> step away from the coffeescript and learn the javascript part first.
[14:56:13] <rhizome> but event gets passed implicitly as well?
[14:56:17] <rhizome> yeah, i'm getting there :/
[14:56:53] <duch_kazatel> $('#theParent').on('click', 'a', myHandler); - this is all you need in the binding if you're going to declare your handler separately.
[14:57:28] <duch_kazatel> function myHandler(event) {/* your code here */} - you still need to define that argument in your function.
[14:58:09] <rhizome> event needs to be defined in the function?
[14:58:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah - javascript wouldn't know what the name of the event object would be otherwise.
[14:58:54] <duch_kazatel> did you see the fiddle?
[14:59:32] <rhizome> oh, the }, event)
[14:59:51] <duch_kazatel> have you ever written a javascript function before?
[14:59:56] <duch_kazatel> i feel like you're missing something...
[15:00:19] <rhizome> not much longhand, no
[15:00:39] <duch_kazatel> you should do that before learning coffeescript imo.
[15:00:59] <MDesigner> hey guys, I'm having a strange issue I'm hoping a jQuery guru can take a quick peek at. I think $.trigger('click') is not behaving properly on iOS
[15:01:20] <duch_kazatel> MDesigner you mean $('selector').trigger('click')?
[15:01:29] <MDesigner> yep
[15:01:57] <MDesigner> on desktop, it triggers a click on a track which then plays (mp3/ogg file). on mobile, I can see it SORT of carries out part of the click but.. not quite. yet when I tap on items, it works fine.
[15:02:18] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10577906/how-to-make-my-click-function-work-with-ios
[15:04:47] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: sadly that does not work
[15:05:29] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: in jQuery 2.x, does $.on() work the same way as $.live() used to? adding handlers onto events that aren't generated yet?
[15:05:38] <duch_kazatel> MDesigner no.
[15:05:47] <duch_kazatel> and it's $.fn.on() and $.fn.live9) btw.
[15:05:57] <duch_kazatel> .on() has a delegated syntax though.
[15:06:04] <MDesigner> yeah, $.live() was removed in 1.9
[15:06:09] <duch_kazatel> $.fn.live() was, yeah.
[15:06:26] <duch_kazatel> $(parent).on('event', 'selector', function() {}); can be used in its place.
[15:06:51] <duch_kazatel> where parent exists at pageload and 'selector' is what you had as the target of .live()
[15:07:05] <MDesigner> lemme try, maybe on mobile the data is loading slower. plus i'm using Angular to generate clickable LI elements
[15:07:11] <MDesigner> so that might have something to do with it. though on desktop it's flawless
[15:07:14] <duch_kazatel> that'd do it.
[15:07:20] <duch_kazatel> race conditions.
[15:11:47] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: nope, didn't work. damn
[15:13:41] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ MDesigner
[15:13:41] <b-ot> MDesigner: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:13:56] <duch_kazatel> i don't have time ATM to dump through your whole page, otherwise i'd just ask for a link.
[15:14:10] <MDesigner> no way it would work on jsfiddle.
[15:14:16] <iceptic1> hey guys anyone know much about php?
[15:14:16] <duch_kazatel> why not?
[15:14:40] <MDesigner> too many dependencies. audio files are referenced, it's also a whole crap-ton of HTML. plus, Angular stuff
[15:15:07] <duch_kazatel> MDesigner 'kay - not asking for you to replicate the app. just wanted a use case that demonstrates, but OK.
[15:15:37] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: yeah, but if I just straight pasted the HTML and JS into there, it wouldn't even work.. so it would be impossible to debug. thanks though
[15:15:49] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i'm saying, but OK.
[15:15:54] <MDesigner> what are you asking then?
[15:16:08] <duch_kazatel> and you're sure the selector you're running .on() against exists at pageload, right?
[15:16:13] <duch_kazatel> did you try using document there?
[15:17:22] <MDesigner> duch_kazatel: yeah it exists. on desktop it works perfectly. $playlist.find('ul').on('click', 'li', function(e) { …..
[15:17:32] <MDesigner> here's what's going on
[15:17:44] <MDesigner> if a user hits my site with a hash, like http://blah/#thishash ...
[15:17:50] <duch_kazatel> btw relying on "click" on mobile is kind of funky.
[15:18:06] <MDesigner> the code looks for that hash. if it matches a track name, it finds the <LI> that has a data tag that matches that hash, and "clicks" it
[15:18:09] <MDesigner> hence playing the music track
[15:18:22] <MDesigner> in other words, with a single URL, the user is taken to my site and a music track starts to auto play
[15:18:37] <duch_kazatel> how are you setting the data attributes?
[15:18:40] <duch_kazatel> using .data()?
[15:18:46] <MDesigner> Angular
[15:18:56] <duch_kazatel> how are you setting them in angular?
[15:19:24] <MDesigner> <li ng-repeat="track in tracks" data-file="{{track.file}}" data-poster="{{track.poster}}" data-project="{{track.project}}" data-stores="{{track.stores}}"><span>{{track.title}}</span><div class="show-for-medium-up" style="float: right">{{track.length}}</li>
[15:19:38] <MDesigner> so then once rendered out, it might say: <li data-file="FjIeu273Jgei" …. >
[15:19:42] <duch_kazatel> mmk - fyi selecting on data attributes is funky business.  you should select on IDs or classes instead.
[15:19:55] <duch_kazatel> we recently got bit by devs trying to do stuff like that.
[15:19:59] <MDesigner> really? hmm
[15:20:10] <duch_kazatel> data attributes are meant for storing data, not getting selected on.
[15:20:17] <MDesigner> var $track = $('.playlist').find('li[data-file="' + trackGUID + '"]'); $track.trigger('click');
[15:20:30] <MDesigner> is this potentially problematic on iOS?
[15:20:39] <MDesigner> again, works perfectly on desktop. Mac, Windows, all browsers.
[15:20:49] <duch_kazatel> selecting on data attributes is potentially problematic, period.
[15:20:55] <duch_kazatel> it may or may not be causing your problem.
[15:21:20] <MDesigner> can't use class though, my GUIDs have symbols in them
[15:21:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:21:41] <MDesigner> <li class="YmeF231==">whatever</li>
[15:21:43] <MDesigner> is that valid?
[15:21:59] <duch_kazatel> is the doctype html5?
[15:22:01] <MDesigner> yep
[15:22:06] <duch_kazatel> then that's valid.
[15:22:32] <MDesigner> interesting. lemme give this a shot
[15:23:01] <duch_kazatel> www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#classes
[15:23:17] <MDesigner> how the hell do you cram all this stuff into your brain? ;)
[15:23:32] <duch_kazatel> i've been developing for a few years. it's apart of the job.
[15:23:47] <MDesigner> does your brain shove out basic life stuff, like putting on shoes? ;)
[15:23:51] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:23:59] <MDesigner> I kid. I was a developer for 13+ yrs
[15:24:09] <MDesigner> I think my brain is just too old to keep all this stuff in. plus I no longer do it for a living.
[15:24:42] <duch_kazatel> repetition helps.
[15:24:44] <duch_kazatel> and code review.
[15:25:08] <MDesigner> yeah for sure
[15:25:48] <MDesigner> damn, that didn't work
[15:25:53] <MDesigner> (using class for lookup)
[15:26:25] <duch_kazatel> try to do a console.log() of your selector before your event bidnign.
[15:26:31] <duch_kazatel> *binding.  make sure it actually exists
[15:28:52] <MDesigner> well, even then, I'm now using delegated event binding. plus I dunno how to view console.log() stuff on iOS Safari
[15:29:08] <MDesigner> I think I'm gonna call this one a defeat
[15:29:26] <MDesigner> could be an iOS Webkit bug for all I know
[15:29:36] <duch_kazatel> the thing you're running .on() against must exist is my point.
[15:29:46] <MDesigner> oh. yeah, that's static HTML. definitely exists
[15:29:52] <MDesigner> $('.playlist ul')
[15:30:03] <MDesigner> that's not programatically generated
[15:30:08] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[15:30:31] <MDesigner> I'm gonna build a quick test page to test a theory out.. brb
[15:48:07] <rhizome> duch_kazatel: turns out the kicker was the "ready: true" directive, and that event is indeed passed implicitly. pulling out the crockford now. :)
[15:49:20] <duch_kazatel> the event object is passed to the function implicitly from jquery to the handler, yes.
[16:47:20] <emx> how do i get the current value in a text input on event keypress?
[17:39:41] <Velveeta> emx: $(this).val()
[19:46:04] <Jadenn> hay hay hay, i'm trying to convert this css bit into a jquery animation http://jsfiddle.net/KKeLL/ - not sure where to start
[20:32:38] <LoneStar99> anyone here used the yodlee api?
[20:41:01] <tw2113> never heard of it
[21:00:59] <AnTi_MTtr> can you get the width of a css class definition ?
[21:01:02] <AnTi_MTtr> wiht jquery
[21:01:17] <AnTi_MTtr> its not nessicarily the property of any element
[21:08:12] <bung> anyone here used the ternary ?: before? Is there some way to make it work with an array, like: function( $args ){ $arg1 = $args['arg1'] ?: null; ... } ? In this case PHP still dies if the key isn't there. It would be nice to not use isset, I'm so lazy :)
[21:09:02] <bung> I guess ?: was added in 5.3, but doesn't handle that kind of usage. Docs are pretty thin on it
[21:11:26] <bung> shit wrong channel
[21:11:27] <bung> ugh
[21:14:33] <AnTi_MTtr> i think i figured it out
[21:14:38] <AnTi_MTtr> i guess jquery doesnt have a way of doing this
[21:14:45] <AnTi_MTtr> so ill just store the data i need in the javascript
[21:14:49] <AnTi_MTtr> as opposed to in the css file
[21:15:03] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[21:15:42] <AnTi_MTtr> i needed to get a height value that was assigned to an unused(but loaded) css class
[21:15:45] <bung> ugh php is invite only atm
[21:16:03] <bung> AnTi_MTtr: JS only has access to the dom
[21:16:07] <systemfault> bung: Channels are never invite. Just authenticate your nick.
[21:16:09] <AnTi_MTtr> yah
[21:16:14] <bung> browsers read the css and apply it to the dom
[21:16:19] <systemfault> bung: Or register it if it’s not done..
[21:16:28] <AnTi_MTtr> so ill just put the values in my js and use the script to assign the css properties
[21:16:44] <bung> check 1-2
[21:17:12] <bung> systemfault: didnt realize i wasn't signed in
[21:17:15] <bung> weeee
[21:17:16] <bung> :)
[21:18:15] <systemfault> :)
[21:18:31] <LoneStar99> I need help parsing the following using jquery ->  http://pastebin.com/6498mZJf  need to retreive the "description"
[21:19:00] <bung> lol LoneStar99
[21:19:06] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 no need to use jquery...
[21:19:06] <bung> running a fake nigerian banking site or what
[21:19:54] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: why not?
[21:20:04] <LoneStar99> bung:  lol, no
[21:20:05] <bung> LoneStar99: maybe it would help to use a json browser, like http://json.parser.online.fr/
[21:20:38] <AnTi_MTtr> are there any good sites to input json data?
[21:22:07] <LoneStar99> bung: yeah using it, but still can figure it out --> have the following code -> http://jsfiddle.net/ZHJY4/1/
[21:22:09] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 because it's JSON.  doesn't require jquery at all.
[21:22:48] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like Body[1].itemData.accounts[0].cardTransactions[0].description
[21:23:20] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: the thing is already using jquery already....
[21:23:36] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 that doesn't make any difference.
[21:23:41] <duch_kazatel> you just need the path to the content.
[21:23:49] <duch_kazatel> what do you think jquery will get you in this case?
[21:24:01] <bung> so what he's saying is use a native "for" loop
[21:24:29] <bung> foreach( $jsonData as $Body ){...} or whatever it is in JS i dont recall
[21:24:37] <bung> then loop on accounts, and card transactions
[21:24:41] <LoneStar99> bung: hmmm k, let me look into that
[21:24:47] <duch_kazatel> the path will be something like this -> Body[1].itemData.accounts[0].cardTransactions[0].description.  YOu need to enumerate through body, accounts, and cardTransactions/
[21:24:55] <bung> "enumerate"
[21:24:58] <bung> thats the key
[21:25:00] <duch_kazatel> for (var i = 0; i < Body.length; i++) {}
[21:25:10] <duch_kazatel> actually, iterate in this case.
[21:25:31] <bung> jQuery does have the .each(), and you can use it if you feel like it, as long as you're getting paid lol
[21:25:49] <duch_kazatel> you could use Body.forEach(), too, but I'd avoid jQuery's each in this case.
[21:26:23] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: so a for loop would be recommended?
[21:26:34] <duch_kazatel> yes, the one I just showed you.
[21:26:49] <LoneStar99> bung: ok will do brb thanks
[21:27:05] <duch_kazatel> but you'll have to do a lot of tests to get the data you want.  do you mind explaining why you're looking for that data?
[21:27:31] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: need to present a sample app on friday
[21:27:41] <duch_kazatel> then build out the iterators.
[21:27:54] <duch_kazatel> use that for loop or use the forEach() method on the arrays.
[21:28:18] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: ok thank you, will begin researching that
[21:28:31] <duch_kazatel> but don't use query to iterate through a simple array.
[21:28:54] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[21:29:38] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: k, yeah it seems to be a pain using jquery for this json ....
[21:29:55] <duch_kazatel> it's not necessarily a pain, just entirely unnecessary.
[21:41:52] <LoneStar99> have the following code, but unclear how to work it correctly -> http://jsfiddle.net/ZHJY4/2/
[21:41:52] <LoneStar99> 			
[21:50:02] <robert0> is data a string?
[21:50:33] <duch_kazatel> also - you're assuming description exists.
[21:51:09] <duch_kazatel> also also: you wat orgs.Body[i]
[21:52:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ZHJY4/3/
[21:54:22] <uskerine> how could I get value -status checked or not- from <input type="radio"> turning into 'Y' or 'N' depending on status
[21:54:23] <uskerine> ?
[21:54:40] <duch_kazatel> uskerine you want .prop('checked
[21:54:52] <duch_kazatel> *.prop('checked')
[21:55:45] <uskerine> I definitively want that
[21:55:59] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: ok let me try that
[21:56:00] <LoneStar99> thanks
[21:56:26] <uskerine> thanks
[21:56:33] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 you have more work to do there.
[21:56:37] <uskerine> one more question, how would I turn this: "validQuote": $('#validQuote').prop('checked'),
[21:56:40] <duch_kazatel> go learn about how to iterate through arrays.
[21:56:52] <uskerine> into "validQuote": 'Y' or 'N' depending on .prop result
[21:56:57] <duch_kazatel> uskerine check out the conditional operator.
[21:57:06] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn conditional
[21:57:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Conditional (ternary) Operator - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[21:57:42] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: yeah
[21:57:50] <uskerine> brilliant, I know that conditional bitch from C
[21:57:52] <uskerine> thanks
[22:02:41] <Alina-malina> how to post an input data to server, without <form></form> tags?
[22:03:13] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina with ajax
[22:03:44] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, i can do post but i dont want to use  <form> tags
[22:03:53] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina why not?
[22:04:23] <Alina-malina> because when i remove those tags, my .post stops working
[22:04:44] <duch_kazatel> that't because your code relies on the form tags to exist...
[22:05:03] <duch_kazatel> why are you removing the form tags?
[22:05:06] <Alina-malina> there is hidden input and a button, but there are many of those
[22:05:13] <Alina-malina> submit button*
[22:05:34] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[22:05:51] <duch_kazatel> the form tag is important for forms.
[22:06:22] <Alina-malina> yes but it is in foreach loop and only the first button works when i submit biutton:(
[22:06:32] <duch_kazatel> still not making sense.
[22:06:36] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Alina-malina
[22:06:36] <b-ot> Alina-malina: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:07:27] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, http://fixee.org/paste/o36v9c5/
[22:07:50] <duch_kazatel> :(
[22:07:56] <duch_kazatel> the html and js please.
[22:08:09] <Alina-malina> erm
[22:09:13] <duch_kazatel> none of this is javascript code.
[22:09:24] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, http://fixee.org/paste/zfa85ex/
[22:09:42] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: so i still need to add another for loop right?
[22:09:49] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 probably.
[22:10:34] <duch_kazatel> Alina-malina your code is (properly) bound to the submit event of the form.
[22:10:40] <duch_kazatel> that's the right way to do it.
[22:10:59] <Alina-malina> yes but when i submit it it just submit all inputs
[22:11:01] <duch_kazatel> you said that it doesn't work after the first click though?
[22:11:07] <Alina-malina> i need that each button submit separate input
[22:11:29] <duch_kazatel> then you need to make each button/input combo a separate form.
[22:11:41] <Alina-malina> yes i do it, but it still submit both inputs :-/
[22:11:54] <duch_kazatel> you have to change your code...
[22:12:10] <Alina-malina> there are like many <input><button>........<input>< button>........
[22:12:16] <duch_kazatel> ...
[22:12:17] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, change to what?
[22:12:26] <duch_kazatel> make each combination of an input and a button inside a form.
[22:12:35] <duch_kazatel> then target a class that you give all those forms.
[22:12:45] <duch_kazatel> then change line 5 to reference $(this).serialize()
[22:12:57] <Alina-malina> hmm ok just a moment please
[22:13:11] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something weird like that.
[22:13:20] <Alina-malina> lol ok
[22:13:24] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you'll need to spend a lot of time writing a bunch of custom bindings.
[22:14:22] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, nah this doesnt work:-/
[22:14:27] <Alina-malina> i think i need some prototyping stuff
[22:14:46] <duch_kazatel> then you're doing it wrong.
[22:14:58] <duch_kazatel> lol you don't need prototypes.
[22:15:05] <duch_kazatel> show me your most recent code.
[22:15:59] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, http://fixee.org/paste/5hmqmhm/
[22:16:33] <duch_kazatel> you can only use an ID once per page.
[22:16:39] <duch_kazatel> that's why you need to use a class instead.
[22:16:47] <Alina-malina> oh
[22:16:49] <duch_kazatel> <form class="ticket-form">
[22:16:58] <duch_kazatel> $(".ticket-form").submit(function(e){
[22:17:41] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, yes it works hahaha
[22:17:45] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, thank you so much my friend!!
[22:18:20] <duch_kazatel> do you see what your original problem was?
[22:18:42] <Alina-malina> :) well i did not know that i can use ID only once hehe
[22:18:55] <Alina-malina> so many small important details:)
[22:19:00] <Alina-malina> i never heared of it
[22:19:08] <duch_kazatel> how long have you been doing web development.
[22:19:30] <Alina-malina> enough time, but i always avoid stuff like this
[22:19:50] <duch_kazatel> that's really basic knowledge.
[22:19:56] <duch_kazatel> every web developer should know that.
[22:20:16] <duch_kazatel> if you've been writing HTML for any amount of time, you should know these kinds of things.
[22:20:20] <Alina-malina> is it in javascript general, or jquery?
[22:20:28] <Alina-malina> well i did not know that
[22:20:46] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, anyways thanks alot!:)
[22:20:47] <duch_kazatel> the ID only once thing?
[22:20:58] <duch_kazatel> that's an HTML basic - not a JS thing.
[22:21:46] <Alina-malina> duch_kazatel, hmmm strange, i think i forgot that, i try to avoid using id, it always causes me rpoblems, now thats why i guess, classes way more better to use then ids, so strange why i even use ids this tim
[22:21:48] <Alina-malina> time
[22:22:23] <duch_kazatel> Ids are for when you want a unique identifier - Classes for when you're grouping things together.
[22:22:59] <Alina-malina> yes now i feel that
[22:24:38] <uskerine> you can also name things
[22:24:41] <uskerine> name="..."
[22:24:44] <uskerine> and that can be duplicated
[22:24:51] <duch_kazatel> names are not good for selection, however
[22:25:15] <uskerine> I use to assign events for buttons in tables -for example DELETE- where ID's can't be easily be different
[22:25:19] <uskerine> them*
[22:25:45] <duch_kazatel> uskerine okay.  what are you having difficulty with there?
[22:26:44] <uskerine> I use name="delete" to dynamically draw a delete button in datatables rows
[22:26:51] <uskerine> then assign the event to that name item
[22:27:01] <uskerine> maybe there is a cleaner/better way to do it
[22:27:13] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: still stuck =(
[22:27:15] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't use the name attribute for that.
[22:27:23] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 please go read a javascript tutorial.
[22:27:37] <duch_kazatel> array iteration and object traversal are pretty fundamental concepts.
[22:28:43] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: yeah have traversed simpler json feeds, just stuck with this nested one...
[22:29:01] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 show me what you have.
[22:30:42] <LoneStar99> pretty much what you provided,  just not sure now many loops until i get to "cardTransactions: ->  plainTextDescription"
[22:31:02] <duch_kazatel> one loop for each array.
[22:31:08] <duch_kazatel> arrays are denoted with []
[22:31:36] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to do some extra munging to test that a property exists, otherwise you'll get errors.
[22:32:26] <LoneStar99> http://jsfiddle.net/ZHJY4/4/
[22:32:49] <duch_kazatel> link to the data again.
[22:33:00] <LoneStar99> http://pastebin.com/6498mZJf
[22:33:05] <duch_kazatel> because this does not do what I told you to do.
[22:33:36] <LoneStar99> i pasted in http://json.parser.online.fr but that service does not provide link
[22:34:19] <duch_kazatel> dunno what that has to do with anything.
[22:35:01] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: it parses data in a more human readable fashion
[22:35:17] <duch_kazatel> still dunno what that has to do with what you need to do here.
[22:35:22] <duch_kazatel> i gave you the path earlier.
[22:37:37] <LoneStar99> yeah, perhaps I am tired, but just need to get at least plainTextDescription to display, then will go to bed...
[22:37:53] <duch_kazatel> that's not what you said earlier.
[22:38:00] <duch_kazatel> go read about array iteration and object traversal.
[22:38:08] <LoneStar99> lol
[22:42:06] <LoneStar99> had been using "$(orgs.Body).each(function(i,el) { ... });  and works on simpler parsing, but for this feed was not working, so you provided me with a new solution which is a bit foreign to me, that is all
[22:42:34] <duch_kazatel> this "new solution" is the native way to do it and almost functionally identical.
[22:42:36] <duch_kazatel> but faster.
[22:43:02] <duch_kazatel> you could also search google for things like "recursively find property name in JSON with JavaScript"
[22:44:17] <LoneStar99> k will do it tomorrow, after work
[22:44:33] <LoneStar99> thank you for all your help!
[22:45:07] <Limarson> Hi@all, I need to make a dynamic set of ajax-calls, wait for them to finish and then do something with the data which is returned by the calls... is it somehow possible to do the example on http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/ with a dynamic set of promises and get the return code in myfunc?
[22:46:56] <duch_kazatel> Limarson sure - read up on deferreds.
[22:47:11] <duch_kazatel> the promises implementation in jquery is funky, but exactly what you wat.
[22:47:13] <duch_kazatel> *want
[22:48:09] <duch_kazatel> all right folks.  have fun.
[22:50:40] <uberjar> Hi.  I want to use a jquery selector to return a bunch of elements but I want to iterate over those elements in random order
[22:50:48] <uberjar> is this possible using $.each ?
[22:51:22] <Limarson> I found several examples but I don't really get it...maybe I prepare some fiddle to show you hopefully what I want to do
[22:51:38] <systemfault> uberjar: Nothing built-in, you’ll have to write your own function.
[22:53:48] <uberjar> systemfault: how would it be theoretically possible ?
[22:53:58] <uberjar> systemfault: I would have to convert the selctor results to an array
[22:54:04] <uberjar> and then randomize the array
[22:54:07] <uberjar> ?
[22:54:11] <systemfault> uberjar: Exactly
[22:55:02] <uberjar> I suppose I could interate sequentially but use a setTimeout() with a random seed value so that effectively the code inside the setTimeout gets executed in random order
[22:55:28] <uberjar> in my case that would achieve the same effect
[22:55:31] <uberjar> hmmm thanks for your help
[22:55:32] <systemfault> uberjar: Cool
[23:25:28] <Limarson> http://jsfiddle.net/NPZh7/2/ has anyone an idea on how to achieve that the data which is usually given to the success-function of the ajax call as parameter will be passed to configs as an array?
[23:26:18] <Cork> Limarson: don't use document.write
[23:26:55] <Limarson> Cork it's just for debug purposes, or does it disturb the process?
[23:27:02] <sacho> Limarson, it seems like you're missing the point of promises.
[23:27:09] <Cork> Limarson: it might, use console.log for debugging
[23:27:23] <Cork> document.write is worse then alert
[23:27:51] <Cork> and ya dfd.done(promises) doesn't really make sense
[23:27:57] <Limarson> What I want to do is, to create an array of ajax calls, execute them, and after all are executed do something with the data
[23:28:18] <Limarson> I tried to understand it by the example from http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[23:28:33] <Cork> Limarson: $.when.apply(null, promises).done()
[23:28:45] <Cork> your trying to use an array as a function in .done
[23:29:40] <Limarson>   .done( [ fn1, fn2 ], fn3, [ fn2, fn1 ] )
[23:30:07] <Cork> no
[23:30:09] <Limarson> I thought that was how it supposed to work... I'm gonna try apply now thank you
[23:30:17] <Cork> Limarson: that is for the functions
[23:30:25] <Cork> not the promise
[23:30:35] <Limarson> ah k
[23:34:20] <sacho> Limarson, http://jsfiddle.net/NPZh7/10/
[23:40:46] <harty83_> anyone in here experienced in jquery ui draggable and iframe droppables?
[23:41:14] <Cork> harty83_: you mean drag elements from the current page into an iframe?
[23:41:54] <harty83_> Cork, yes; all works well except for when the iframe scrolls.  Then the droppable doesn't take into account the scrolled distance.
[23:42:18] <Cork> harty83_: i'm surprised you get it to work at all
[23:42:38] <harty83_> ha! well that's encouraging :-)
[23:42:48] <Cork> it is two separate documents so the communication becomes quite hard
[23:43:24] <harty83_> yea; it works with jquery ui's iframeFix option but just fails to account for scrollable iframes.
[23:43:29] <Cork> wouldn't cross my mind to try to be honest
[23:44:45] <harty83_> Cork, yea.  My scenario is that I'm building a "page builder" where I don't want the builder's CSS to manipulate the document (thus the use of an iframe) but have tokens that I want to drag and drop into contenteditable divs (converted to ckeditor instances)
[23:45:41] <harty83_> guess I'm going to have to find a way to add it all to the iframe document rather than spliting between parent and iframe
[23:46:32] <Cork> harty83_: there is a way in newer html to scope style tags
[23:46:44] <Cork> sadly it isn't supported cross browsers yet
[23:46:48] <Cork> (only chrome and firefox)
[23:47:01] <Cork> would have let you go without the iframe
[23:47:26] <harty83_> yea, that's usually the case isn't it?  ;-) Gets a little aggravating.
[23:47:46] <Cork> harty83_: well it is still very new so it isn't that bad
[23:48:25] <Cork> harty83_: for reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style#A_scoped_stylesheet
[23:48:36] <Cork> but ya, good luck; i think you're going to need it ^^'
[23:48:58] <harty83_> ha! thanks!
[23:52:40] <Limarson> Cork: This one does work much better, but configs does only contain the last answer object: http://jsfiddle.net/Cus22/1/ How can I access the resultset from the second ajax call?
[23:53:11] <Cork> Limarson: configs is config
[23:53:19] <Cork> you get one argument for each ajax call
[23:53:28] <Cork> you could use arguments if you like
[23:53:37] <Cork> $.each(arguments, function(config) {});
[23:53:57] <Limarson> i tried to add second parameter but this one was undefined
[23:53:58] <Cork> wait... $.when($.apply(null, promises)) ??
[23:54:02] <Limarson> So it should work like that?
[23:54:18] <Cork> that should be $.when.apply(null, promises)
[23:54:27] <Limarson> Ah damn
[23:55:25] <Limarson> Cork <3 you are my hero
[23:55:51] <Limarson> I was on this for 2 days+ now
