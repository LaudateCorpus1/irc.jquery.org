[06:49:33] <sine0> probably best asked here. my wordpress theme uses jQuery 1.12.4 or something, and I have created a script using 3.1.0 which i load on page using script tags. however my themes mobile menu does not work when this is loaded (conflicting jquery?)
[06:50:03] <sine0> Uncaught TypeError: url.indexOf is not a function
[06:50:03] <sine0>     at jQuery.fn.init.jQuery.fn.load (jquery-3.1.0.js:9649)

[12:32:50] <jak2000> hi all
[12:55:29] <poboy> hi
[13:34:56] <Joey__> hi all, I'm trying to validate hidden fields, I have set validator.settings.ignore and it seems to somewhat work initialy because the error is triggered but when I change the value of the hidden through code it isn't detected, I tried calling element.closest("form").validate() after changing the hidden field but that doesn't seem to work either. Anyone experience with validating hidden fields?
[13:34:56] <Joey__> Am I missing something?
[17:45:00] <carpii> hi all, does anyone know if any versions of jQuery provide a polyfill for String.includes?  Or does this not belong in jQuery?
[17:45:17] <carpii> its unsupported on IE11 and all previous versions, but included in ECMA 5
[17:45:35] <carpii> EMCAScript 2015 sorry
[18:46:19] <shoky> carpii: it does not belong in jQuery
[18:47:23] <carpii> yeah im inclined to agree now I think about it, since its a prototype of String and not something jQuery abstracts
[18:48:05] <shoky> jquery is DOM + ajax :p
[18:49:32] <carpii> yup :)
[18:49:36] <carpii> i had a brainfart i guess :D
[19:17:49] <skinux> Out of curiosity, is this page describing how to do the same thing ReactJS does, with fewer lines of code? Or is it just talking about similar to what React does? http://hackflow.com/blog/2015/03/08/boiling-react-down-to-few-lines-in-jquery/
[19:40:01] <shoky> skinux: i don't really know, and it's probably a better question for a react channel, but it's possible it's doing some of what react is doing, sure. i doubt it's as near as efficient though. and also, they don't include the VDOM, or diffing, or DOM patching stuff
[20:26:09] <herbalpert> is anyone willing to give me some advice on how to make a small addition to an existing function?
[20:29:52] <herbalpert> background.cycle.js cycles the background-image, and I want it to also change the html content of a specific div. I think I'm close, but can't quite piece together the right approach.

[22:38:50] <beshoo> is there any getBoundingClientRect for JQ
[23:53:41] <juria_roberts> If I use async:true in an ajax request I see this in the browser console: Deprecation] Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience.
[23:54:24] <juria_roberts> How do I make an ajax request with async:false effectively a synchronous request by some sort of a hack?
