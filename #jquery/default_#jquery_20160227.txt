[07:52:25] <xadom> Hi do you have an idea why my sentence doesn't match ? https://jsfiddle.net/8asprmdp/25/
[09:55:00] <deko96> hello guys
[09:55:51] <deko96> is there any way to check if popup window is fully loaded if window is opening remote url?
[14:01:27] <glowdemon1> http://www.hastebin.com/otumemekaj.html - Hey, is anyone able to see what's wrong with this? It doesn't throw any error
[14:01:44] <glowdemon1> jQuery validation used to work before on a different project, but here it doesn't seem to work :(
[14:02:05] <taplar> your selector looks incorrect
[14:02:23] <taplar> your trying to validate an element with an id 'form' that is a child of a form tag
[14:02:35] <glowdemon1> If I use $('#form') it'll throw me this error:
[14:03:04] <glowdemon1> 'Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined'
[14:04:19] <hiljusti> are you including jquery?
[14:04:40] <hiljusti> (and not just jquery form validator)
[14:05:01] <glowdemon1> Yes
[14:05:30] <glowdemon1> http://www.hastebin.com/esixovorac.django should be correct AFAIK
[14:07:50] <hiljusti> it looks like that's not the way to call jquery validator
[14:07:51] <hiljusti> http://www.formvalidator.net/#configuration
[14:08:42] <hiljusti> or at least i'm not seeing anywhere in the getting started docs that it adds .validate() to all jquery promises
[14:08:52] <hiljusti> i think it just adds it only to $.validate()
[14:09:00] <glowdemon1> Mh
[14:09:17] <glowdemon1> An old project uses the syntax I had just used
[14:09:30] <hiljusti> oh nvm
[14:09:31] <hiljusti> http://www.formvalidator.net/#advanced
[14:09:34] <taplar> ah
[14:10:03] <glowdemon1> Mh
[14:10:12] <hiljusti> you'd still need to call a function handler instead of just an obj literal
[14:10:22] <glowdemon1> When I try to select the form with $('form') it gives me 'Cannot read property 'nodeType' of undefined', this is what I found really odd
[14:10:43] <taplar> it looks like maybe your trying to use the plugin like jsvalidate, but this is a different plugin?
[14:11:01] <glowdemon1> I didn't check that actualy, one sec
[14:11:03] <taplar> http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/
[14:11:06] <taplar> different plugin
[14:12:13] <hiljusti> so the no-error scenario because there was no element found (#form as child of form)
[14:12:20] <taplar> seems right
[14:12:25] <taplar> no
[14:12:42] <taplar> i think it's cause as you pointed out in their docs, that plugin takes the target as a property
[14:12:44] <hiljusti> error scenario is because .validate() isn't getting the input it expects?
[14:12:58] <taplar> not as the object acted on
[14:13:05] <taplar> atleast when given a setup object
[14:13:08] <hiljusti> yeah
[14:13:17] <glowdemon1> Thanks
[14:13:23] <glowdemon1> I tried a different link
[14:13:28] <hiljusti> yay teamwork
[14:13:30] <taplar> :)
[14:13:44] <glowdemon1> Maybe people should stop naming their validation plugins 'jQuery validation' o,O
[14:13:59] <hiljusti> too many competing standards
[14:13:59] <taplar> everyone wants to be the one true *insert*
[14:14:22] <hiljusti> let's make "valid-javascript" to rule them all
[14:14:31] <taplar> lol
[14:17:22] <Uhkis> why is FF so ** flow with .animate() (even with velocity)
[14:17:30] <Uhkis> slow*
[14:19:35] <Uhkis> http://uhkis.net/ made this out of boredom and it showed IE11 and Edge are A LOT faster than ff or chrome
[14:19:59] <Uhkis> can hardly call it animation in firefox because it's so slooow
[14:20:24] <taplar> moving pretty well for me, but yeah, there is some jitter
[14:21:27] <Uhkis> it's smooth as butter on IE11 and Edge
[14:21:27] <taplar> i don't see any jitter in chromium
[14:22:14] <taplar> i'm even in a vm right now, :P
[14:22:35] <Uhkis> clearly a faster computer than this laptop of mine
[14:25:52] <arc_> still some jitter in edge
[14:26:17] <arc_> and ie
[14:26:26] <arc_> but not as bad as chrome or firefox
[14:26:46] <arc_> i7 4770k and gtx 970
[14:29:02] <Uhkis> gotta try to optimize it
[14:55:04] <Uhkis> huge performance boost by throwing away jquery :p
[18:39:40] <HowardwLo> why does this: var delayed_delay = setTimeout(console.log("test"), 8000);  log test immediately?
[18:39:53] <HowardwLo> shouldnâ€™t it wait 8 seconds?
[18:41:21] <HowardwLo> oh sorry, should be in JS :D
[19:46:43] <f0urtyfive> hola... Dynamically creating new set of divs, call .draggable().resizable(); on them, and for some reason, drag works fine but resizable doesn't work
[19:47:01] <f0urtyfive> have no issues calling it, and I get the resize cursors, but when you try to resize nothing happens
[19:47:09] <f0urtyfive> anyone have any advice on how to troubleshoot?
[19:52:43] <shoky_> f0urtyfive try reproducing it in a jsfiddle
[19:57:45] <f0urtyfive> shoky_: figured it out, apparently I forgot to remove some old code that was calling resizable() on startup... and that was somehow breaking things, even though those div's didnt exist yet, they were somehow getting the ui-resizable class and not working
[19:57:55] <f0urtyfive> I removed that code and now I can add resizable() b y hand and it works
[19:58:47] <f0urtyfive> but ty.
[20:53:46] <futini> Hello, it possibly prevent close the options when i click in a option in select/option?
[20:54:39] <futini> The default behavior is close the options when i clicked one. But i need prevent this, its can??
[22:27:14] <redlizard> Greetings.
[22:27:16] <redlizard> I have inherited a piece of code that uses jquery to create a DOM tree containing a self-contained form, and adds it somewhere to the main document nested inside some other form.
[22:27:18] <redlizard> Now, as far as I know this is illegal, as form tags may not be nested. Nonetheless, the piece of code seems to work as expected on all major browsers.
[22:27:21] <redlizard> Does jquery contain some specific workaround to make this possible on most browsers, limitations be damned? Or should this code NOT work and is it a mystery?
[22:27:24] <redlizard> Or am I misunderstanding the limitation? That's another possibility, of course.
