[07:57:31] <Naruto> Hello everyone. Having an issue using jQuery's "position" thing. https://pastebin.com/raw/dgavvuQ2
[12:26:26] <zampa> Anyone having issues that jquery $(this).offset().top/left not returning proper values on some devices?
[12:27:10] <zampa> I am trying to create a small custommade popup appearing just where the user clicked a link. It works fine on all browsers i have tested. And on my own samsung galaxy s6, but some android/iphone users have reported that its misplaced.
[12:27:16] <zampa> So im not sure whats causing that to happen.
[17:04:00] <SideFX> If <li> is this, how can I access the value of the next input?  So <li>something</li><input type=hidden value="another">  I am trying this.closest( "input" ).val();
[17:04:05] <SideFX> But nothing is coming back
[17:06:11] <SideFX> Actually just figured out problem, was using this instead of $(this)
[18:33:31] <leptone> I am attempting use jquery within webpack
[18:33:47] <leptone> my browser console gives `Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined`
[18:34:05] <leptone> I followed these docs https://webpack.js.org/plugins/provide-plugin/#usage-jquery
[18:34:41] <leptone> https://gist.github.com/caseysiebel/8e497011423e36f76ea8f1e3323e4f28
[18:34:59] <leptone> but i'm still seeing that error
[18:35:07] <leptone> i npm installed jquery
[18:35:14] <leptone> to i need to add it another way?
