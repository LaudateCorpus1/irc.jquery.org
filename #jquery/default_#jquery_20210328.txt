[16:05:21] <forgotmynick> i have an iframe with no src which has dynamic content written into through .append (it loads several things like images). id like the parent window to resize the iframe based on the iframe documents height but i can't figure out how to do this. tried body onload and on load listener within the iframe with no avail. ive tried on load on the parent, creating events before and after the content is appended with no
[16:05:21] <forgotmynick> avail. is there anything else i can try?
[16:52:37] <robertmaxrees> forgotmynick you said the iframe has no src, right?
[16:53:25] <forgotmynick> robertmaxrees: no src url, content is appended through jquery
[16:53:35] <robertmaxrees> then there's no load event.
[16:53:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:53:49] <robertmaxrees> though i gotta ask: why use an iframe here?
[16:57:02] <robertmaxrees> If you went with a normal div or something, you could handle all of this via css.
[23:24:01] <jak2020> Not luck:  https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/dk8w91ty/16/
[23:24:35] <robertmaxrees> what does "not luck" mean?
[23:24:50] <robertmaxrees> also: what even is that object?
[23:24:59] <jak2020> not sorted... i need sort by value
[23:25:21] <robertmaxrees> you don't sort objects.
[23:25:34] <robertmaxrees> arrays, sure.
[23:25:36] <robertmaxrees> but not objects.
[23:26:05] <jak2020> any advice?
[23:26:18] <robertmaxrees> why is that an object and not an arrayuu?
[23:26:34] <robertmaxrees> *array
[23:27:06] <robertmaxrees> oh nvm.
[23:27:23] <robertmaxrees> you shotgunned the question out to multiple places - looks like somebody in ##javascript is helping you.  good luck! :)
[23:27:57] <jak2020> yes
