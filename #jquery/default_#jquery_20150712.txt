[00:13:22] <anom> https://jsfiddle.net/rwm2r44p/ - // how would I check each li.key to see if the first character is a T?
[00:35:14] <javalover> curious about something, i'm currently using browsers history in order to manipulate user screens. I.E. if a user opens a window i'm pushing the browser state forward...is this the proper way to do it, so that user can push forward/back button to navigate?
[00:48:28] <anom> https://jsbin.com/yexijawuve/edit?html,js,output any idea how to  sort these numerically and then alphabetically?
[03:36:10] <bwen> is there a specific channel for jQuery Mobile?
[03:43:40] <Vladimirski> Trying to understand when creating a new <li> element like this: $('<li>'), will this create one li element in each and every ul element or just the first one it finds?
[03:43:42] <Vladimirski> I don't get it
[03:43:55] <mdev> how can I match a li that has a href link in it
[03:44:01] <mdev> I want to match based on part of the link
[03:44:11] <mdev> match as in find/get a ptr too
[03:49:12] <mdev> too hard for you guys? don't worry about it, i'll figure it out
[03:49:20] <ertl> hello guys, I'm trying to do this: I have a form with select elements, the user should find them empty, then he'll write something, press enter and the select should populate with the results found looking for the inserted string on a mysql db; right now I have this code: http://pastebin.com/TamzpStH .. I disabled the "post form on pressing enter", I'm able to save the inserted string on a variable but the ajax call does not work... any 
[03:50:24] <mdev> I know jquery can be tricky
[03:50:28] <mdev> even for pros
[03:58:02] <Oka> Why does your li element have an href in the first place?
[03:58:53] <Oka> Or are your saying there is an anchor element inside the li?
[03:59:30] <Oka> s/your/you
[04:02:15] <Vladimirski> What does the dot mean in $('.btn') ?
[04:02:26] <Uhkis> lol, nice try to taunt for faster help
[04:02:28] <Vladimirski> sometimes I see dots and sometimes there is no dots
[04:02:44] <Uhkis> Vladimirski: its a class selector
[04:02:47] <mdev> Oka just does, I didn't write it
[04:02:47] <Vladimirski> ok
[04:02:53] <mdev> but I need to get ptr to modify it
[04:03:14] <mdev> looks like <li><a href="http://site/mail.php">Mail:0</a></li>
[04:03:24] <Vladimirski> Uhkis: so I select a class from HTML text?
[04:03:56] <Uhkis> Vladimirski: that would select all elements with the class btn
[04:04:15] <Vladimirski> oh I see
[04:04:32] <Vladimirski> so $() is a selector?
[04:04:39] <Uhkis> ?g jquery selectors
[04:04:39] <b-ot> Uhkis: jQuery Selectors - W3Schools â†’ http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp
[04:04:44] <Uhkis> ugh
[04:04:45] <Vladimirski> I mean if I only type $('btn') for example?
[04:05:03] <Uhkis> dont use w3schools
[04:05:36] <Uhkis> that would select all tags of btn (which dont exist in html)
[04:05:46] <Vladimirski> all tags?

[04:08:54] <mdev> awesome Oka, you rock brother, thanks a lot

[04:09:54] <Vladimirski> Uhkis: Oh, thank you alot mister!
[04:10:23] <Vladimirski> Uhkis: So it doesn't matter if I use single or double quotes ?
[04:11:00] <Uhkis> Vladimirski: user preference, i use singles
[04:47:21] <Abhijit> :-D
[04:47:54] <Abhijit> came to ask question I am struggling with last 1 hour. while typing here in irc prompt realized the spelling mistake in div name!
[04:57:25] <Uhkis> :)
[05:32:18] <Abhijit> when jquery is executing a while loop or a recursive function does it wait for it or just go ahead with next line irrespective of current loop finished or not?
[05:32:25] <Abhijit> jq or javascript in general
[05:44:12] <vinorcola> Hi all, how can I make AJAX send JSON data in a body of a GET HTTP request ? It seams to work for POST and PUT, but not for GET.... strange
[05:54:13] <morfin> there is also toggleClass
[05:54:17] <morfin> oops
[05:57:45] <ashgotti> Morning everyone. I'm going a bit crazy because I can't figure out how to apply input masking to fields that are added via ajax. It works for fields already in the DOM. // Format currency fields
[05:57:45] <ashgotti>     var money = [
[05:57:45] <ashgotti>      '.field-name-field-residence-rent input',
[05:57:45] <ashgotti>      '.field-name-field-gross-revenue input',
[05:57:45] <ashgotti>      '.field-name-field-income-amount input',
[05:58:05] <ashgotti> Oops, meant to paste this http://pastebin.com/2huaMkg5
[05:59:19] <ashgotti> I thought I was using delegation properly
[06:00:55] <ashgotti> or wait sorry, not using delegation at all. I'd like to know how to use delegation with a loop
[06:08:01] <ashgotti> Or maybe a better question, how to use an each function with ajax content
[06:13:13] <ashgotti> *facepalm* it was a selector issue
[06:50:58] <myth_> sup jqueries
[07:03:46] <ertl> hello guys, I'm trying to do this: I have a form with select elements, the user should find them empty, then he'll write something, press enter and the select should populate with the results found looking for the inserted string on a mysql db; right now I have this code: http://pastebin.com/TamzpStH .. I disabled the "post form on pressing enter", I'm able to save the inserted string on a variable but the ajax call does not work... any 
[07:12:45] <Abhijit> from jq i am rendering onclick="myfunction($(this),var) function on a div. when i click on this div the function works except that it dont recognize the variable. any idea why?
[07:14:43] <bwen> dont do inline javascript
[07:16:55] <Abhijit> bwen, ok. i replaced them with global variables to all function.
[07:17:15] <bwen> dont put "onlick" in the markup... its evil
[07:18:18] <Abhijit> :-o
[07:18:30] <Abhijit> bwen, logically i want this functionality. how can I do this then?
[07:19:06] <bwen> put everything in a javascript.js file or within a <script type="text/javascript"></script>
[07:19:12] <bwen> then actualy USE jquery :p
[07:20:02] <Abhijit> bwen, basically I have a html5 video element. i want its onclick event. but the inbuilt onplay event needs me to know the specific video div id which I cant be sure since there will be more than one video at a given point and user can click any one of them. there number varries.
[07:20:23] <Abhijit> bwen, what are you talking about? i already have a js in seperate file. i need to triggre one function on video click
[07:20:24] <bwen> give your DIV an id="potatoe" then do: $('#potatoe').on('click', function () { alert('hi'); });
[07:21:19] <Abhijit> bwen, i have <video id="v1"> <video id="v2">................................<video id="vn">
[07:22:28] <bwen> abhijit: $('#v1').on('click', function() { alert('Look mah! I am learning jQuery!'); });
[07:24:27] <Abhijit> bwen, the "total" number of videos will be generated on the fly. hence number not known in advance.
[07:24:27] <Abhijit> hence cant use id
[07:24:27] <Abhijit> i tried to use its class but class on click function wont work
[07:24:27] <Abhijit> sorry my video do not have class. its parent div has though
[07:24:33] <bwen> abhijit: better yet... $('video').on('click', function() { alert('View id = '+ $(this).attr('id') +'!'); });
[07:25:02] <Abhijit> bwen, so I should write 10 $('#v1').on('click', function() { alert('Look mah! I am learning jQuery!'); }); statementsl/
[07:25:02] <Abhijit> ?
[07:25:04] <Abhijit> or 20?
[07:25:06] <Abhijit> or 30?
[07:25:08] <Abhijit> how many?
[07:25:17] <bwen> abhijit: $('video').on('click', function() { alert('View id = '+ $(this).attr('id') +'!'); });
[07:25:17] <Abhijit>  $('#v1'). will work on that single video
[07:36:52] <ashgotti> Good morning. I'm having issues traversing the DOM when using event delegation: http://pastebin.com/n0DYb6tv I can't seem to go up the dom using 'closest'. It works if I don't use delegation. Am I missing something?
[07:39:13] <shoky> ashgotti: looks fine. try reproducing the issue in a jsfiddle
[07:39:22] <ashgotti> shoky: good idea
[07:40:56] <ashgotti> shoky: of course it was someting simple. I went to copy my markup to jsfiddle and noticed that the selector I was using for closest doesn't actually exist..duh
[07:41:17] <shoky> next time go straight for jsfiddle ;p
[07:41:18] <ashgotti> shoky++
[07:41:36] <ashgotti> shoky: the more I learn the more I forget to check the basics and assume it's something complicated
[07:41:53] <ashgotti> "what's jsfiddle going to show me? It must be some complicated jquery rule I don't know yet"
[07:42:50] <shoky> heh ;p
[07:50:58] <ashgotti> Another question. For code like this that runs on DOM ready, http://pastebin.com/ybTqR7tY, when there is an AJAX event, I'd like the code to be run again. Do I have to duplicate the code and put it in $(document).ajaxComplete()? I'm hoping there is a way of avoiding duplicate code
[07:51:59] <shoky> put it in a function and call the function whenever you want it to run?
[07:52:38] <ashgotti> shoky: that's what I figured, create the function, call it on DOM ready and then place it in ajaxComplete as well.
[07:53:58] <ashgotti> shoky: I just thought maybe there is a way to watch the DOM like delegation so that I don't have to remember to put the function in two places: ready and ajaxComplete()
[07:57:03] <shoky> nah there isn't a good way to do that, best to be explicit
[08:48:14] <jrockjiggz> hey guys, i'm passing an object ResponsiveBootstrapToolkit into jquery function, but it says function doesn't exist.. i really don't understand http://dpaste.com/2ZZX2N5
[09:11:37] <peterson_> inside a success of a getJSON, i'm trying to set some values using data from the json. the data is received well, but i don't seem able to 'find' the inputs that i want - is there something inherently wrong with this: $(this).parents('td').find('.store_product_name').val(data.name);
[09:13:42] <shoky> peterson_: nope. first guess would be that "this" is not what you think it is there
[09:14:24] <peterson_> shoky: ahhhhh
[09:14:47] <peterson_> actually, you're probably right, this inside the success function would probablyt not refer to original el
[09:15:29] <peterson_> shoky: that did the trick - thanks!

[15:05:44] <guzzlefry> Is there any way to specify a callback for failures with jQuery.post()?
[15:07:17] <tw2113> aren't the callback fields the same as jQuery.ajax()
[15:07:32] <guzzlefry> ah yeah, just found it out.
[15:07:45] <guzzlefry> I can do jQuery.ajax().fail(function() {})
[15:51:25] <arc_> are there any examples of sites that have databases that aren't changed very often, where they generate static pages only when the database is changed
[15:51:37] <arc_> if so, what would you use to do that
[15:57:38] <guzzlefry> arc_: Something like this? http://jekyllrb.com/
[16:06:09] <BillCriswell> arc_: It sounds like you want a static site generator.
[16:06:48] <BillCriswell> How is the "database" being changed?
[16:20:58] <arc_> could be guzzlefry
[16:21:09] <arc_> i was thinking of how it would be done from scratch
[16:21:31] <arc_> BillCriswell manually
[16:21:40] <arc_> via some web interface
[16:24:11] <BillCriswell> Is this something that's already built and you're looking to add it or you're thinking about an approach from the start?
[16:26:00] <arc_> the latter
[16:26:58] <jak2000> exist a tutorial for make a beutiful input text's buttons radios, selects? thanks
[16:27:02] <arc_> i mean, it seems like sites would be a lot more responsive without all the dynamic content
[16:27:26] <arc_> maybe it's a waste of time to even think about it, idk
[16:27:51] <BillCriswell> I've played around with http://www.webhook.com/ and really enjoyed it. It's a CMS that generates static files. The form builder thing is awesome and the templating is really intuitive.
[16:28:16] <arc_> supergiant games :D
[16:28:37] <BillCriswell> I suggest just paying the $9 a month, but you can set it up yourself... but I'm way too lazy for that.
[16:29:04] <arc_> hm, this seems pretty good
[16:29:05] <arc_> thanks
[16:29:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah it's awesome.
[16:29:52] <BillCriswell> you get 14 days to see if it's good for you, if you already have a good idea should be plenty of time to see if it's right for you.
[16:30:35] <arc_> i'd probably install it myself, since i already pay for unlimited web hosting
[16:31:14] <BillCriswell> haha well, have fun with that
[16:31:17] <arc_> :p
[16:31:40] <guzzlefry> Are the jqXHR.done() and .fail() callbacks only for indicating if the request went through? i.e. .fail() won't fire for a 5xx response code, only network timeouts.
[16:31:45] <synapt> I like that people still think unlimited really means unlimited
[16:31:56] <arc_> rolleyes
[16:32:13] <arc_> maybe i just didn't think anyone would care about the nuance of my web hosting plan
[16:32:27] <synapt> Though I really dislike that companies still put a twist on the phrase unmetered to be fancy
[16:32:37] <synapt> Then again AT&T just got in huge crap for it so maybe that will change soon
[16:34:03] <BillCriswell> @guzzlefry There's an `always` that runs no matter what.
[16:34:48] <guzzlefry> BillCriswell: Right, but will .fail() fire if I get a 500 HTTP response code, or only if the request fails to get a response?
[16:39:21] <guzzlefry> nevermind, I went the tias route
[16:40:51] <BillCriswell> What was the verdict? I have a feeling it wouldn't since the ajax request worked, just didn't get what it expected.
[16:41:31] <guzzlefry> BillCriswell: It seems to trigger fail when I return a 500 status. Let me see if the opposite is true.
[16:41:59] <guzzlefry> yep
[17:12:49] <guzzlefry> I have an Ajax call that's fired when a button is clicked. Is there any way to make that button's element avaiable in the jqXHR callbacks?
[17:19:52] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: $('button').on('click', function (event) { var button = this; $.get('/whatever').done(function (response) { console.log(button); }); }); should do the trick.
[17:21:00] <guzzlefry> 0.o
[17:21:22] <guzzlefry> That looks like magic to me. :P Still much to learn.
[17:21:24] <guzzlefry> Thanks
[17:31:32] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[17:34:47] <cryptopsy> how can i add keybinds to traverse this tree structure? http://www.jqueryrain.com/?pl_6d8jV
[17:54:20] <jgravois>  I have a table with an anchor tag with a class of btnUpRow in each row. If I use the following, the anchor tag's href is followed, so the preventDefault() isn't being respected. -- $('#table').on('click', '.btnUpRow', function(evt){ evt.preventDefault(); });  -- It is prevented if I place the click directly on the .btnUpRow but I would rather not.

[18:03:34] <jgravois> k
[18:05:48] <jgravois> gnarf: hmm, it's a codeigniter app and the table itself is in a repeat ... I don't think jsBin accepts codeigniter.
[18:06:17] <jgravois> gnarf: I'll just copy the code source ... it'll be "close"
[18:08:53] <gnarf> jgravois: http://jsbin.com/golobojaza/edit?html,js,output simple reduced case seems to work
[18:09:23] <gnarf> jgravois: are you sure there isn't an event listening on those links that forces the navigation not using the "browser default" ?
[18:13:24] <jgravois> gnarf: Is this good enough -- http://jsbin.com/betetivusu/edit?html,js,output
[18:14:22] <jgravois> ultimately the tables rows will move up and down (using this -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/617274/swapping-rows-in-jquery -- answer #2

[21:44:52] <Abhijit> how can I check if video source exists or not in jquery?
[22:09:49] <javlens> how do I execute code 10 seconds after loading a page, but only if a user doesn't click on a div or other specific element?
[22:13:01] <rcyr> $(function() { var timer = setTimeout(function() { alert('OMG'); }, 10000);  $('body').once('click', function() { if (timer) { clearTimeout(timer); timer = null; } }); }); Something a bit like that
[22:13:08] <rcyr> Not tested
[22:16:39] <rcyr> javlens: This should work: http://jsfiddle.net/1ajrfswu/
[22:25:47] <javlens> rcyr: thanks a bunch, that helped

[23:43:10] <hellyeah> hey
[23:43:26] <hellyeah> how can i check my script works on browsers is there a tool for checking this?
[23:48:37] <tw2113> open the website in every browser you want to test?
[23:50:48] <hellyeah> tw2113:
[23:51:17] <hellyeah> it gave me a problem on google chrome but it didnt give me any problem on chromium why is it happened?
[23:52:30] <tw2113> because they're different browsers with different levels of js support
[23:53:38] <tw2113> i'd worry more about stable chrome than i would chromium, if you're trying to code for current users
[23:54:01] <tw2113> if your'e aiming to future proof things and anticipating future ECMA stuff, chromium would be more the place to go
[23:55:04] <hellyeah> okey but how can i find solution
[23:55:05] <hellyeah> ?
[23:56:22] <tw2113> my first suggestion would always be to search google/duckduckgo/whatever for others experiencing the same issue
[23:56:44] <tw2113> there may already be answers out there that explain how/why/etc
[23:56:54] <tw2113> if you've tried that and came here in frustration
[23:57:07] <tw2113> actually posting the error/code used/etc for others to see would be the first step
[23:59:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[23:59:43] <hellyeah> i just opened other jsfiddle and copy and paste the code everything seems working
