[00:09:27] <murosai_> i wonder how i should debug a non-responding script?
[00:09:47] <fps> murosai_: use some console.log output to see what it's doing
[00:09:57] <fps> [simplest form of debugging]
[00:10:07] <murosai_> and it seems to be stuck on some jquery function so i can't really put a breakpoint there either
[00:10:26] <murosai_> hm
[00:10:37] <fps> murosai_: ah, so you already know where it's stuck
[00:10:42] <fps> murosai_: what function is it
[00:10:42] <fps> ?
[00:10:48] <murosai_> well that's what firefox tells me
[00:11:08] <murosai_> Sizzle.uniqueSort = function( results ) {
[00:11:13] <murosai_> this one..
[00:11:36] <fps> hmm, that line just assigns a function object to a variable...
[00:11:54] <fps> erm, strike the "object". i'm still in a different language mindset ;D
[00:12:26] <murosai_> yeah, well it's stuck executing that function, so the line below that
[00:13:37] <fps> hmm, and those two lines are from the jquery lib?
[00:15:22] <murosai_> yup
[00:15:53] <fps> hmm, maybe in the end the input size to the sorting algorithm is too large, so it takes a long time
[00:15:59] <fps> is it maybe called over and over?
[00:16:17] <fps> sprinkle some logging into your part of the code to see if it maybe calls it over and over, etc..
[00:16:18] <murosai_> very likely
[00:16:23] <fps> brb (reboot)
[00:22:36] <fps> re
[00:59:36] <Prasanth88> Hello all
[01:00:57] <donmatthew> hi
[01:01:10] <Prasanth88> How are you don?
[01:02:36] <Prasanth88> I'm trying to use this functionality but i want multiple selection without holding down the control key ie just by clicking different boxes, it must select those boxes without unselecting the previously selected one.
[01:02:46] <Prasanth88> https://jqueryui.com/selectable/#serialize
[01:10:01] <widoz> wops
[01:10:02] <widoz> hello
[01:11:38] <Prasanth88> hai
[01:15:35] <Prasanth88> Can i know how to achieve multi selection on this https://jqueryui.com/selectable/#serialize ?
[01:21:40] <xKraty> Prasanth88: just press CMD/CTRL to multi select
[01:25:46] <Prasanth88> yeah
[01:26:00] <Prasanth88> i know it, but, i want multi select without holding ctrl key
[01:26:17] <xKraty> oh ok, let me see
[01:26:28] <Prasanth88> you click a box, it gets selected, select another, it will also be selected, without unselecting previous one
[01:26:58] <Prasanth88> and with default unselect toggle function
[01:28:56] <xKraty> http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/CkRxj/
[01:29:01] <xKraty> like that?
[01:29:38] <Prasanth88> yep. thanks alot :)
[01:30:23] <xKraty> np
[01:31:58] <Prasanth88> and one more thing. we are seeing the values selected on top. how can i capture those selected index values
[01:32:00] <Prasanth88> ?
[01:32:29] <Macaveli> I have a big list of articles how do I start pagination? Anyone have a good tutorial?
[01:55:46] <xKraty> Prasanth88: might a bit late sorry http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/CkRxj/1/
[01:58:04] <Guest5497> Is it normal it takes half a second to a second to put .draggable on some 700 elements?
[01:58:42] <Cork> Guest54664: that is a lot of elements and a lot of dom restructuring
[01:58:58] <Cork> so wouldn't surprise me
[01:59:20] <Cork> but i haven't tested so i don't have any numbers
[01:59:25] <Guest5497> It doesn't restructure the dom. It adds classes and events under the hood to be used later, I can't see a different in the dom itself
[02:00:29] <Guest5497> Adding "ui-draggable" on every element I've called it on (the 700-ish elements)
[02:01:01] <Guest5497> This is just the initialization, I'm talking about
[02:01:04] <xec> class names are part of the dom, strictly speaking
[02:01:24] <Cork> Guest54664: it does more then just adding class names
[02:01:57] <Cork> but like i said, i can't say what speed to expect, as i've never used it on more then ~ 100 something elements
[02:02:08] <Guest5497> True, but it's not close to as intensive to put class names on elements, as it is to remove, add and change elements
[02:02:30] <Cork> Guest54664: make a simple testcase on a fiddle and test
[02:02:49] <Guest5497> I guess it's not the place I should look to improve my performance, in that case.
[02:04:40] <Prasanth88> oh. me too sorry xKraty :| had lunch just now. thanks for the update
[02:04:43] <Guest5497> Cork: There is too much stuff in it to simply do that, sadly. It's all the stuff around generating the elements for .draggable, too. I'm simply looking for the best place to optimize and saw that it was 750-ish ms to put the events on the draggable elements
[02:04:59] <Cork> Guest54664: the point is exactly that
[02:05:06] <xKraty> Prasanth88: :)
[02:05:12] <Cork> Guest54664: make a very simple testcase with 700 elements
[02:05:23] <Cork> Guest54664: if running draggable on it takes time
[02:05:50] <Cork> Guest54664: you know the reason, if it doesn't then you prob have something else in your code causing it
[02:07:01] <Prasanth88> :)
[02:08:08] <Guest5497> Cork: Thanks for the help
[02:31:32] <anli> Is there still mouse released outside events?
[02:32:36] <BinaryKi1ten> wouldn't that be a dropevent?
[02:34:19] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/ghQB9/
[02:34:34] <anli> the mouseup event will not trigger if the mouse is released outside the square
[02:36:06] <seutje> that's by design afaik
[02:36:37] <anli> Guess then what my question is :)
[02:37:10] <anli> How do I detect mouseup outside
[02:37:13] <seutje> u'll have to do ur delegating manually I think
[02:37:22] <anli> I wish jquery could do it for me
[02:37:34] <seutje> bind the shebang to the document and match target on mousedown, set a flag, on mouseup, check that flag
[02:37:46] <anli> How is that not ugly :)
[02:37:49] <seutje> u expect jQuery to break the spec by default?
[02:37:59] <anli> Why ont
[02:38:00] <anli> not
[02:38:07] <seutje> there's plenty of libraries for that already :P
[02:38:11] <anli> When you ask the question in that way, then maybe
[02:39:22] <anli> Ah, I confused this with flash and onMouseReleaseOutside
[02:40:46] <anli> I will maybe need to accept to use a combination of mouseup and mouseout
[02:41:10] <PrasanthG88> xKraty: The output is desired but i had selection boxes which are random and some boxes are empty. How to get the ids of such boxes?
[02:41:40] <xKraty> hold on
[02:44:21] <xKraty> PrasanthG88: http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/CkRxj/2/ ?
[02:44:58] <xKraty> oh wait i misunderstood i guess
[02:44:58] <PrasanthG88> damn. you are fast :)
[02:45:07] <xKraty> is that what you wanted?
[02:45:10] <PrasanthG88> yeah
[02:45:15] <xKraty> oh cool! :D
[02:45:36] <seutje> anli: http://jsfiddle.net/ghQB9/1/ could prolly make it a bit cleaner though
[02:45:50] <PrasanthG88> i can give empty blocks with no ids and no selection. i want to know how to declare ids and you showed it. now i can with that :)
[02:46:06] <PrasanthG88> can dead* with
[02:46:14] <PrasanthG88> can deal* with :)
[02:46:45] <anli> $target instead of target
[02:46:46] <anli> works
[02:46:47] <PrasanthG88> Sorry for bothering xKraty :)
[02:46:47] <anli> http://jsfiddle.net/ghQB9/2/
[02:46:50] <xKraty> :) happy to be helpfull
[02:47:17] <xKraty> now i get back with that stupid facebook login
[02:47:22] <anli> Clean and clean :)
[02:47:36] <anli> Maybe it would make sense to create a .mouseupoutside handler
[02:47:59] <anli> But then we need to know that the mousedown handler occured in the element and not in another
[02:48:48] <seutje> anli: actually, think ben alman made a plugin for this
[02:48:51] <PrasanthG88> What happened with fb login?
[02:48:56] <anli> yeah
[02:49:00] <seutje> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-outside-events/docs/files/jquery-ba-outside-events-js.html#Defaultoutsideevents
[02:49:17] <anli> I have also been there, seems useful
[02:49:20] <seutje> but yeah, thing is, u wanna make sure the mousedown was withing the element
[02:49:23] <anli> While we were talking
[02:49:29] <anli> yeah
[02:49:31] <seutje> his code might be worth looking into though
[02:49:38] <anli> probably
[02:49:48] <anli> I am fine with removing pressed in mouseout however
[02:49:50] <seutje> my example even works with selecting text though
[02:49:54] <anli> cool
[02:49:55] <seutje> not sure if that's desired: http://jsfiddle.net/ghQB9/3/
[02:54:25] <Macaveli> Is it possible to paginate articles? I've never used a paginator.
[02:54:31] <Macaveli> Any good tutorials?
[02:57:16] <anli> seutje: thx for the input btw
[03:04:12] <effortDee> hi everybody, im using $.now()/1000 to get a date
[03:04:44] <effortDee> and i want to put this date in to a hidden input field value so that the date is saved as someone registers, how would i go about doing this?
[03:06:29] <Cork> effortDee: $('#hidden-input').val($.now()/1000)
[03:06:47] <Cork> where you replace hidden-input with your id for the field
[03:06:56] <effortDee> my id is registrationdate
[03:07:44] <effortDee> as i managed to get the value to save with the extra field when a user registers
[03:08:08] <effortDee> so that will now fill it with the date?
[03:08:08] <basiclaser> soo.... toFixed() likes to round numbers up. What do? )
[03:08:14] <Cork> effortDee: also you should prob do this server side
[03:08:23] <effortDee> can't be Cork
[03:08:32] <Cork> effortDee: at least if you want it to be trust worthy
[03:08:35] <effortDee> the 'cms' im adding this too is VERY restrictive
[03:08:46] <Cork> effortDee: as users can prevent this from getting set
[03:08:57] <effortDee> aye indeed cork, been through this, the cms can't save a registration date
[03:09:04] <effortDee> we dont run the cms/server
[03:09:09] <Cork> ...
[03:09:11] <effortDee> and we're restricted to just a few things
[03:09:45] <effortDee> its one of the biggest ecommerce platforms on the internet, costs Â£6000 a month to run and is the worst thing i've ever used
[03:09:50] <effortDee> :(
[03:10:02] <effortDee> drupal, magento, wordpress im in lvoe with haha
[03:10:07] <effortDee> this cms makes me cry
[03:10:18] <effortDee> but thankyou Cork for your help
[03:10:22] <Cork> effortDee: then talk with the hoster
[03:10:38] <effortDee> Cork, to get a cache clear it takes 24hours and you ahve to book it
[03:10:40] <Cork> adding a created_at/updated_at column doesn't sound like something they would oppose
[03:11:03] <effortDee> oh believe me Cork, i know you probably think this is just stupid but this is how the cms is
[03:11:09] <basiclaser> meow
[03:11:11] <effortDee> meow
[03:11:12] <basiclaser> soo.... toFixed() likes to round numbers up. What do? )
[03:11:15] <Cork> effortDee: well sorting this web client side is close to pointless
[03:11:30] <effortDee> its the only way to do it
[03:11:34] <Cork> basiclaser: to the number of decimals you define
[03:11:43] <Cork> effortDee: then you really don't have a way at all
[03:11:45] <effortDee> we've had the client, my manager, project manager, two developers and myself talking about it for a few days
[03:12:13] <Cork> effortDee: something as simple as disabling js would break it for you
[03:12:18] <effortDee> i know
[03:12:20] <effortDee> and cache clears
[03:12:24] <effortDee> and changing a computer
[03:12:26] <Cork> meaning it is useless
[03:12:26] <seutje> sounds more like Convulsion Management Software :D
[03:12:29] <effortDee> i know
[03:12:37] <effortDee> seutje
[03:12:44] <effortDee> i want to cry so bad
[03:12:49] <Cork> so why are you puting time into it, if it is a waste of time?
[03:13:01] <effortDee> because we're getting paid for it and the client knows it isn't perfect
[03:13:09] <Cork> ...
[03:13:24] <effortDee> :)
[03:13:31] <basiclaser> CMS is my initials too :D
[03:13:32] <Cork> this feels like the question i saw a few months back
[03:13:40] <effortDee> ?
[03:13:40] <Cork> where a developer wanted to fix html errors in js
[03:13:45] <effortDee> thats not me :D
[03:13:47] <Cork> cause he didn't have access to the server code...
[03:14:01] <effortDee> Cork
[03:14:01] <Cork> all he could touch was the js file
[03:14:04] <Cork> one of them >_<
[03:14:11] <effortDee> i pray you never ever see this CMS in your life
[03:14:24] <Cork> effortDee: i might have
[03:14:34] <effortDee> Venda
[03:14:37] <effortDee> heard of it?
[03:14:41] <basiclaser> but yeh srsly Cork i have simulataenously a growing number that has two decimals, and another with three decimals. It looks silly when the 2 decimal number jumps ahead of the 3 decimals.
[03:14:43] <Cork> effortDee: but the good part is that i normally can help steer the projects
[03:14:48] <Cork> effortDee: possibly
[03:14:51] <Cork> not sure
[03:15:03] <effortDee> you haven't if you're saying not sure, but thanks again for your direction :)
[03:15:08] <effortDee> been helpful!
[03:15:20] <Cork> effortDee: i'm not doing that line of work now days
[03:15:33] <Cork> effortDee: i did quite a bit of it ~3 years back though
[03:15:50] <effortDee> change for the better?
[03:15:54] <Cork> effortDee: ya
[03:16:00] <effortDee> Cork, good on ya! :)
[03:16:09] <Cork> basiclaser: it follows the normal rounding rules
[03:16:31] <Cork> basiclaser: (0.44).toFixed(2) => 0.4
[03:16:42] <Cork> basiclaser: (0.45).toFixed(2) => 0.5
[03:16:47] <Cork> opps *toFixed(1)
[03:17:12] <Cork> basiclaser: you might want to use Math.floor()
[03:17:23] <Cork> but then you need to fiddle with the base
[03:17:49] <Cork> js> print(Math.floor(0.45 * 10) / 10)
[03:17:55] <b-ot> Cork: 0.4
[03:18:37] <Cork> effortDee: now days i write the site from the ground up, no cms at all :)
[03:18:58] <effortDee> sweet
[03:19:01] <basiclaser> Cork: thanks, ill try that
[03:19:07] <effortDee> only done that at uni
[03:19:22] <sunbeam> how can I detect a click in an iframe?
[03:19:31] <effortDee> at work i use this platform, magento, wordpress
[03:19:31] <Cork> sunbeam: you can't
[03:19:34] <effortDee> at home i use drupa;lp
[03:19:37] <effortDee> drupal*
[03:19:37] <ghostlines> morning, say I want to access the content in this span class how can I target it? <p class="total">Totalprice <span class="float-right">â¬299</span></p>
[03:20:03] <Cork> sunbeam: in some browser you can put an element ontop and through that grab the click
[03:20:15] <Cork> sunbeam: but then the iframe doesn't get it at all
[03:20:16] <sunbeam> Cork: how come? an iframe is an element of which the width and height are known
[03:20:37] <sunbeam> Cork: I mean, I want the main page to alert something if the user clicks in the iframe on MY page
[03:20:42] <Cork> sunbeam: it can be/have been used  to steal user information
[03:20:50] <sunbeam> ahh
[03:20:52] <sunbeam> hmm
[03:21:03] <Cork> sunbeam: it is possible to do if the iframe content is from the same domain
[03:21:07] <sunbeam> Cork: it is
[03:21:21] <Cork> then you need to inject an event handler into the other page
[03:21:40] <Cork> $('iframe').contents().on('click', function() {})
[03:21:45] <sunbeam> Cork: that page is generated by javascript after the page is loaded
[03:22:13] <Cork> sunbeam: events don't bubble from iframes cause it is a different document
[03:22:27] <Cork> so you need to bind the event to that document
[03:22:45] <sunbeam> Cork: to the iframe document?
[03:22:49] <Cork> yes
[03:22:56] <Cork> like the code i just gave you
[03:23:16] <sunbeam> Cork: I add that code in the main page that is loading the iframe
[03:25:33] <sunbeam> right?
[03:25:46] <sunbeam> nvm got it working sorry
[03:26:18] <Cork> if that was a question ya (you missed the ?)
[03:26:57] <sunbeam> yep
[03:50:35] <PrasanthG> xKraty: are you available?
[03:50:50] <xKraty> PrasanthG: im swearing but tell me
[03:51:00] <PrasanthG> i'm lost implementing it in table with tds
[03:51:08] <PrasanthG> oops. sorry again :)
[03:51:29] <xKraty> uh? i don't get it
[03:52:31] <PrasanthG> the demo code is having lists inside unordered list
[03:52:59] <PrasanthG> but i'm trying it on a table with trs and tds, which is not allowing me to select the tds
[03:53:49] <xKraty> you want to select tds X_x
[03:53:56] <PrasanthG> yes
[03:54:11] <xKraty> let me see
[03:54:39] <xKraty> meanwhile if you know why the facebook php sdk doesn't always return the email lol
[03:54:53] <xKraty> so every td has his own ID?
[03:55:05] <PrasanthG> yeah
[03:56:58] <PrasanthG> are you aware that if the user sets his profile information as private, you can't get them?
[03:57:17] <PrasanthG> you can't get those emails from facebook.
[03:57:54] <PrasanthG> try taking a backup of your facebook profile and you will see most of your friends emails aren't retrieved.
[04:00:26] <basiclaser> hey Cork i have been working on the same problem still, here is the point i have gotten to > http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/tWfqL/1/
[04:01:43] <basiclaser> so i am trying to make 3 decimal and a 2 decimal representation of the same float, and i don't want the 2 decimals to round up, as people can see from the 3 decimal that the time isn't yet what is stated by the 2 decimal
[04:09:07] <xKraty> PrasanthG: http://jsfiddle.net/xKraty/CkRxj/3/
[04:09:53] <xKraty> btw yes but when you use sdk you require permission to get email and you should get mail back, and i do get mail for some account ( like mine that is fully blinded! ) and not some otehr -.
[04:09:56] <xKraty> -.-
[04:18:14] <Cork> basiclaser: if you want two decimals you need to do (Math.floor(basic * 100) / 100)
[04:18:39] <Cork> basiclaser: basically you need to enlarge the value by the number of decimals you want to keep
[04:26:29] <murosai_> how can i drag multiple elements with jquery-ui draggable?
[04:27:52] <lombrozo> Anyone know how I can replace all my fadein/fadeout calls with a simple css('overlay') call if performance on users machine is rubbish?
[04:28:03] <lombrozo> *opacity
[04:28:15] <Cork> lombrozo: use css3
[04:29:36] <lombrozo> Cork: does css3 cater for rubbish machine performance then?
[04:30:04] <Cork> lombrozo: firstly the animation is gpu accelerated
[04:30:12] <Cork> so you will get better performance out of that
[04:30:20] <ankurk_> I hate coming in office early
[04:30:28] <ankurk_> anyways Good Morning folks
[04:30:30] <Cork> machines that doesn't have gpu normally use older browsers so they don't support css3
[04:31:01] <obihann_> ankurk_: I kind of like it... nobody here, get lots done before any meetings start... get to rummage through desks
[04:31:12] <obihann_> I mean... nobody would do that
[04:31:21] <Cork> lombrozo: also you can just disable the transision for users you think are too slow
[04:31:25] <lemonsparrow> how to get js date object from string  "2/01/14" for February 1, 2014 ?
[04:31:34] <Cork> lombrozo: as css3 makes it declarative it is easy to do
[04:31:37] <ankurk_> obihann: that's true though but I would rather work from home in peace :P
[04:32:06] <paulvd> hello, i have a jquery menu here which functions on click, but the third level menu doesn't act the way i want it to http://jsfiddle.net/3y8m9/
[04:32:23] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to parse the string and generate a date object from it
[04:32:25] <obihann_> ankurk_: good point... I actually came in early today because it was get a ride and show up early or take the bus
[04:32:28] <lombrozo> Cork: so I can substitute my element.fadeIn code with a CSS alternative?
[04:32:31] <PrasanthG> oh. you must try that on other's account which is secured. it may also us as it is our own account
[04:32:36] <obihann_> and if I took teh bus I would have had to leave at the exact same time lol
[04:32:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how to do it? is there an easy way around ?
[04:32:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: assuming 14 will always be 2014
[04:32:56] <Cork> lombrozo: opacity transision
[04:33:10] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no 19** date will be passed
[04:33:12] <Cork> lemonsparrow: by parse i mean ex. regex match in the string
[04:33:19] <ankurk_> obihann_: I will have an excuse to leave early today though :P
[04:33:28] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can you show the code ?
[04:33:28] <Cork> and no the format you have isn't natively supported
[04:34:00] <PrasanthG> great, tds are working but if i insert empty without any id and class, it is also being selected...
[04:34:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: something like /(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})/
[04:34:11] <lombrozo> Cork: can I get a callback when opacity reaches the desired amount like I can in jQuery?
[04:34:33] <Cork> lombrozo: you can get an event when it reaches the new value
[04:34:36] <PrasanthG> http://jsfiddle.net/CkRxj/6/
[04:34:51] <Cork> lombrozo: transisionEnd (with all the mess of prefixes and case formats that are out there)
[04:34:55] <lemonsparrow> Cork: didnt get that..
[04:35:00] <Cork> lombrozo: but you should normally not need that
[04:35:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that regex will give you an array with the different values
[04:35:24] <Cork> from that you need to construct a date object
[04:35:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok..
[04:36:42] <lombrozo> Cork: thanks for all your help
[04:36:49] <lemonsparrow> st = $('#startDateDisplay').val() "2/01/14" >>> var dt = new Date(st.replace(/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})\/(\d{1,2})/)); returns Date {Invalid Date}
[04:36:54] <Cork> lemonsparrow: another alternative is something simple like .split('/')
[04:37:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't just replace in the string...
[04:37:30] <Cork> ?mdn date
[04:37:31] <b-ot> Cork: Date - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[04:37:39] <Cork> check what arguments it take
[04:37:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: can u tell me some simple logic ? I don't want to use any parsers for this..
[04:38:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ?
[04:38:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't just throw the data into date
[04:38:55] <Cork> lemonsparrow: the format you have isn't supported
[04:39:00] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[04:39:02] <Cork> so you need to convert it
[04:39:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: how.. is what I need to know... pls show the correct code
[04:40:53] <xKraty> hey ankurk_
[04:41:01] <ankurk_> hey xKraty sup?
[04:41:11] <xKraty> i'm getting mad
[04:41:12] <Uhkis> this xKraty ankurk_ love connection :-D
[04:41:27] <Cork> lemonsparrow: writing a full date parser is not just a few lines of code
[04:41:28] <ankurk_> Uhkis: What no :P
[04:41:34] <PrasanthG> lol
[04:41:44] <ankurk_> and Mad xKraty? Why?
[04:41:44] <PrasanthG> dont we have facebook irc? :D
[04:41:45] <Jattenalle> look at him blush
[04:41:49] <Cork> lemonsparrow: date has a argument alternative where you give it the different values separately (not as a string)
[04:41:57] <xKraty> php facebook login
[04:41:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: yeah.. that's why I asked for a simple solution..
[04:42:03] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to first grab those values, adjust them to be correct
[04:42:09] <Cork> and then create a date object with them
[04:42:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: there isn't one
[04:42:23] <xKraty> i'm not getting why it doesn't retrieve email from some account that are set right
[04:42:33] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you could look for a helper lib that helps parse dates
[04:42:44] <ankurk_> any errors on console?
[04:42:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: var startDate1 = new Date($('#startDateDisplay').val()); undefined >>> startDate1 Date {Sun Feb 01 1914 00:00:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)}
[04:42:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: the problem here is year is 1914
[04:42:55] <xKraty> no it's php :D
[04:43:01] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I want it to be 2014
[04:43:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ya, cause the format isn't supported
[04:43:16] <ankurk_> then do var_dump :P
[04:43:24] <PrasanthG> xKraty: ./join ##php
[04:43:25] <xKraty> i do <.<
[04:43:47] <xKraty> oh i did look for #facebook didnt though about that thanks
[04:44:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: something like startDate1.setFullYear((startDate1.getFullyear+100)) returns NaN
[04:44:21] <Cork> lemonsparrow: startDate1.getFullyear is a function
[04:44:30] <ankurk_> yeah ask there, you never know :D
[04:44:33] <Cork> lemonsparrow: and again the format isn't working, so you shouldn't do it like that
[04:44:40] <Cork> as it likely will break later
[04:45:17] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok cork..will try for some alternatives..
[04:45:17] <paulvd> hello, i have a jquery menu here which functions on click, but the third level menu doesn't act the way i want it to http://jsfiddle.net/3y8m9/
[04:46:11] <slax0r> paulvd: all your levels have same class names
[04:46:41] <slax0r> deeper levels should be identified somehow with another class, and then operate on those different class names
[04:47:56] <fattest>  Is it possible to make a more simplified version of this javascript? I only need the animate effect http://jsfiddle.net/nijk/sVu7h/
[04:49:11] <inad922> hello
[04:49:22] <inad922> How can I check if a given element already has a change listener?
[04:50:50] <Cork> inad922: dom doens't provide a way to do that
[04:51:03] <Cork> inad922: and you can hack around to do it in jquery
[04:51:21] <Cork> but that is not supported, and it only knows about handlers registered with jquery
[04:51:29] <inad922> Cork: Ah ok I guess I just do an unbind aagain that event and rebind it
[04:51:47] <Cork> inad922: or just not bind it in this way?
[04:52:02] <Cork> inad922: delegated event listeners is normally the answer your looking for
[04:52:19] <inad922> Cork: I'm not following. Could you give me a link?
[04:52:19] <paulvd> slax0r: isnt there something which is done so that it doesnt repeat
[04:52:24] <paulvd> like preventdefault ?
[04:52:28] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:52:28] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:52:39] <Cork> inad922: you can use on too, but it has a special syntax
[04:52:43] <Cork> so start by reading delegate
[04:54:34] <Guest49646> Hi. My $.ajax call always calls the .error() handle, even though the HTTP returns 200. I've tried 'html', 'text' and default dataType. Logging the xhr object doesn't reveal anything. textStatus is simply "error"
[04:54:50] <tompaw> What would be the next step in debugging this?
[04:57:33] <Cork> Guest49646: is the resource from the same domain?
[04:57:50] <Cork> oh, tompaw^
[04:58:09] <tompaw> Cork: nope, I just stumbled across the jsonp trail.
[04:58:45] <Cork> tompaw: if you use jsonp then you can only use dataType: 'jsonp'
[04:59:00] <Cork> and the server can only send .js back
[04:59:38] <tompaw> Cork: So there is no way to pull an arbitrary website on the client side, like with curl?
[04:59:45] <Cork> no
[04:59:57] <Cork> that is the point of cross domain protection
[05:00:11] <Cork> tompaw: if the site exposes it, and allows it, you can
[05:00:21] <Cork> but no to arbitrary sites
[05:00:30] <tompaw> *sigh*
[05:00:31] <Cork> as that would be a security problem
[05:00:32] <tompaw> OK, thanks.
[05:01:02] <Cork> ex. a random site grabbing/changing your facebook account password
[05:01:06] <murosai_> hm i wonder why when i type $(".myclass") in firebug console i get a return value of null even though i know there is an element with that class
[05:01:08] <Cork> or grabbing your address/phone from it
[05:01:12] <Cork> or...
[05:01:28] <Cork> murosai_: firebug defined $
[05:01:34] <Cork> $=jQuery
[05:01:40] <Cork> and it should work like you are use to
[05:02:34] <murosai_> so i should use jQuery(".myclass")?
[05:02:46] <Cork> that is another option
[05:02:55] <murosai_> ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[05:03:04] <Cork> hmm try $=window.jQuery
[05:03:07] <murosai_> but for example $("body") does work..
[05:03:22] <Cork> murosai_: ya, like i said firebug defines $
[05:03:38] <Cork> and it is a shorthand for getElementByTagName if i remember correctly
[05:03:56] <murosai_> $=window.jQuery doesn't work either
[05:04:31] <tompaw> Cork: a random site can have a server side proxy in the same domain...
[05:04:37] <Cork> murosai_: hmm, that should work
[05:04:41] <tompaw> Anyway, that's what I gotta do, thanks (:
[05:04:55] <Cork> tompaw: sure, but then you don't get the clients cookie
[05:05:06] <Cork> or you get the cookie for your domain
[05:05:09] <Cork> not the target domain
[05:05:48] <tompaw> Cork: I was under the impression I can't get client's cookie for .facebook.com anyway, unless the request goes to *.facebook.com
[05:05:57] <tompaw> Ah
[05:05:58] <tompaw> I see
[05:06:00] <Cork> tompaw: exactly :)
[05:06:14] <tompaw> I could intercept the JS object and pull the data from it.
[05:06:25] <tompaw> All right, curl it is then!
[05:17:27] <Cork> aaah, walk down nostalgia lane... http://zachholman.com/posts/only-90s-developers/
[05:17:36] <fattest> does anyone know simple show hide content (with class not id) jsfiddle?
[05:17:58] <asdzxc> Afternoon.
[05:18:02] <Uhkis> Cork: i'm pretty sure any web surfer from 90s remember those :)
[05:18:04] <Cork> fattest: what?
[05:18:37] <Cork> Uhkis: i made an emulator for blink when firefox removed it
[05:18:43] <Cork> many users requested it O_o
[05:18:45] <ankurk_> Cork: I remember when the whole page layout used to be in the tables :P
[05:18:59] <Cork> ankurk_: ya, part of the list on that page
[05:19:09] <Uhkis> Cork: that site is totally missing the spinning "email me" gifs
[05:19:15] <Cork> my personal fav is spacer.gif
[05:19:33] <Cork> Uhkis: heh geosities!
[05:20:23] <Uhkis> and these <FONT SIZE=42>
[05:20:28] <Uhkis> hahahaha
[05:21:12] <Cork> "you haven't lived until your mouse had a trail of twelve fireballs behind it"
[05:21:30] <Cork> anyone remember the images that used to trail the mouse on plenty of pages?
[05:21:39] <Cork> or the animated gif backgrounds
[05:22:15] <asdzxc> Got a question. I have got two lists, and I am trying to append item from 2nd list to the beginning of 1st list using onclick and before(). I am currently doing it like that: 2nd list li.click -> find 1st element of 1st list; append clicked element $(this) using before() to the 1st list. And it works fine, but when i append that item it is not clickable, because i have to return false at the end of function so my page doesnt reload. 
[05:22:38] <Uhkis> Cork: or snowflakes
[05:22:53] <Cork> Uhkis: ya
[05:23:02] <Cork> those used to kill performance though
[05:23:13] <Cork> and was a bit after 90's
[05:23:40] <Uhkis> i recall coffee cup html editor having that snowflake effect ~1998
[05:23:52] <Cork> asdzxc: use delegate event listener
[05:24:23] <asdzxc> Cork: gonna read docs :)
[05:24:30] <Cork> asdzxc: $('#ul2').on('click', 'li', function() { $('ul1').prepend(this); })
[05:24:35] <Cork> opps
[05:24:39] <Cork> asdzxc: $('#ul2').on('click', 'li', function() { $('#ul1').prepend(this); })
[05:25:13] <Cork> asdzxc: and prepend is what you want, not before
[05:25:37] <asdzxc> http://paste.ofcode.org/cKQVZBY5jwpCkY8iMy8di5 done it like that, hope it is readable, lol
[05:26:09] <Cork> asdzxc: that will break if the first ul is empty
[05:26:26] <asdzxc> it can't be
[05:26:58] <asdzxc> It works on navbar, if there are too many elements on navbar (checking width), list of half of them is appearing
[05:27:13] <Cork> and you are making the code more complex to have that short coming :)
[05:29:36] <asdzxc> Basically what i was trying to do is to check if elements in #replacement list width is higher than 40% of browser width if it is, take few items from that list and append dropdown menu, after that if user clicks on any element in dropdown menu it should appear   as 1st element of #replacement list
[05:31:25] <asdzxc> And it works k, the only thing i am struggling with is that appending.
[05:31:35] <asdzxc> I just have to make it work atm, will try to refactor later.
[05:53:40] <jop008> how to center an image in a td cell?
[05:54:18] <jop008> I tried this #spec {   text-align: center;   vertical-align: middle; }
[05:54:49] <Cork> by image you mean <img>?
[05:58:23] <jop008> tried this <td id='spec' align='center' class='my-class'><img src="images/time.png" alt="..." ></td>
[05:58:33] <Cork> man use css
[05:58:36] <jop008> image is right  aligned instead of center
[05:58:37] <Cork> not the old attributes
[05:58:45] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/M8HFc/
[05:58:49] <jop008> I tried with css also focourse
[05:59:29] <jop008> td.my-class { text-align: center; }
[05:59:36] <jop008> but no success
[05:59:46] <Cork> jop008: like you see on the link it works just fine
[05:59:50] <Cork> so, example is needed
[06:03:06] <jop008> the fiddle is fine http://jsfiddle.net/M8HFc/1/
[06:03:17] <jop008> so one of my css is blocking
[06:22:04] <ankurk_> TIL about Module patterns in jQuery
[06:25:16] <ramin> hello, what am I doing wrong when the ajax call results in the error:   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[06:25:42] <ramin> I tried already several contentTypes: application/json or just json
[06:26:32] <xKraty> ramin: you have forgot a , { } or there is one more
[06:27:09] <ramin> in the resulting json? mh no in the ajax call
[06:27:14] <ramin> mmh letme check
[06:27:58] <Cork> ramin: the content you get from the server isn't valid json it sounds like
[06:28:11] <Cork> ?g jsonlint
[06:28:18] <b-ot> Cork: JSONLint - The JSON Validator. â http://jsonlint.com/
[06:28:42] <ramin> mh but I can call the address in the browser and the resulting json is valid
[06:28:49] <jop008> I use this .imgenter {    text-align:center; }   no centering when I change it to #imgcenter it is rednered as expected
[06:29:27] <Cork> jop008: you might have a more specific css rule specifying something other then center
[06:29:54] <jop008> that is the pain with css
[06:30:01] <jop008> you loaase track
[06:30:07] <ramin> thats the url I'm calling
[06:30:08] <ramin> http://backend.trxp.eu/productList.php
[06:31:25] <ramin> do I have to pass a datatype that matches the json in the data parameter?
[06:32:50] <jop008> this worked text-align:center !important;
[06:33:03] <Cork> jop008: you don't want to use !important
[06:33:12] <Cork> jop008: write the rule to be more specific instead
[06:33:19] <Cork> look in what other rules apply on the element
[06:34:02] <YokoBR> hi guys, i'm getting a date format like Wed Mar 19 2014 14:00:00 GMT-0300 (BRT), and i would like to get a simple dd/MM/YYYY HH:mm, how can i do that?
[06:34:06] <YokoBR> this is the code : $("#eventstart").html(start);  start is my start time var
[06:34:53] <Cork> YokoBR: you could try new Date(string)
[06:35:04] <Cork> i think that date format is supported natively
[06:35:20] <YokoBR> oh, found this :) http://momentjs.com/
[06:37:11] <jop008> there was an important one that overrules all others so that's why
[06:38:12] <ramin> thats my call : http://pastebin.com/g7KCG7a7
[06:52:11] <YokoBR> what is wrong with this code? $("#eventstart").html(moment(start, "D MMMM  YYYY, h:mm"));
[06:55:49] <Macaveli> I have an input box is it possible to detect when a value is changed? The on Change event is not working because the value is changed with query
[06:55:57] <BillCriswell> YokoBR: What is start?
[06:56:21] <YokoBR> my start time, but i think i've solved it, thanks BillCriswell :)
[06:56:28] <YokoBR> it's a var, btw
[06:56:37] <BillCriswell> Probably just need a .format().
[06:56:42] <BillCriswell> YokoBR: I knew that lol
[06:57:01] <BillCriswell> but it could have been something that isn't cooperating with moment.
[06:57:37] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: What do you mean with query?
[06:58:02] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, it's changed with .val() it's a hidden field
[06:58:17] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: Ah, well when you do the .val() add on .trigger('change')
[06:58:28] <BillCriswell> That'll fire the change event.
[06:58:39] <BillCriswell> $input.val('new val!').trigger('change')
[06:58:40] <Macaveli> It's a min.'s sigh
[06:59:11] <BillCriswell> Macaveli: What?
[06:59:24] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, Not my code that does the change
[06:59:33] <Macaveli> Using JQuery plugin
[07:00:49] <BillCriswell> IS it changing the value often or just on page load?
[07:01:15] <Macaveli> BillCriswell, fixed it
[07:01:20] <Macaveli> Added tehe trigger
[07:02:17] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[07:04:06] <Fenikkusu> Is it better to use .click() or .on('click'')?
[07:05:34] <BillCriswell> Fenikkusu: .click is just a shortcut for .on('click') I believe, so you might as well save a step.
[07:06:56] <Fenikkusu> BillCriswell, Thank you. That is what I thought.
[07:14:44] <joesmith> hey all, can anyone tell me why my cloned table rows can't be removed? http://jsfiddle.net/Ch87v/
[07:15:51] <joesmith> delete only works for the non-added rows
[07:16:06] <BillCriswell> joesmith: The click events aren't attached to newly added rows.
[07:16:35] <BillCriswell> joesmith: Luckily, it's easily fixable with event delegation: http://jsfiddle.net/Ch87v/1/
[07:17:23] <joesmith> BillCriswell: thanks so much! documentation seemed to say the same thing, but i couldn't find as elegant/simple of a solution
[07:17:53] <BillCriswell> Yeah, documentation can be a pain in the butt.
[07:19:05] <BillCriswell> joesmith: It's at the bottom of the "Direct and delegated events" section at https://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:19:57] <joesmith> BillCriswell: thanks a lot, i will study up
[07:21:18] <BillCriswell> Think of it as a click event on a parent that only runs if a certain type of child triggered it.
[07:22:20] <joesmith> cool, got it
[07:24:42] <jop008> I want to search my page I used <ul><li> for that
[07:24:58] <jop008> the <li>holds on every row a table
[07:25:41] <jop008> This makes the page complicated and running slow. How can I do this make my own search and scroll into view?
[07:26:32] <jop008> I now use this filter option http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/docs/lists/lists-search.html
[07:27:12] <jop008> The list items hold a table with 3 columns in it on every li item
[07:29:45] <jop008> Is there a good way to search the page based on user input?
[07:31:28] <seutje> jop008: might wanna prevent the LI content from rendering until it has to
[07:32:02] <seutje> or wait, does it lag prior to filtering>
[07:32:03] <seutje> ?
[07:32:15] <jop008> But is this teh right way? <ul<li><table></li></ul>
[07:32:48] <seutje> well no, ur <ul> is malformed and the table is empty
[07:33:07] <jop008> Shorthand of course the table is filled
[07:33:19] <jop008> I am not allowed to paste code here
[07:33:53] <jop008> ul<li><table></table></li><li><table></table></li><li><table></table></li></ul>
[07:33:56] <jop008> like this
[07:34:28] <BillCriswell> It seems like you should just have a table with multiple rows.
[07:34:43] <jop008> That is true Bill
[07:34:53] <jop008> but how to create it searchable
[07:35:00] <murosai_> what am i messing out here: var folders = elems.filter(function(index) {return this.children(".folderIcon").size() > 0;});
[07:35:01] <jop008> How to find things in the table
[07:35:15] <murosai_> children is apparently not a function
[07:35:17] <jop008> Use my own search script?
[07:35:46] <jop008> The list item search is a beautiful one
[07:36:03] <jop008> Is there a search way likte that on a table?
[07:36:05] <seutje> `g datatables
[07:36:07] <b-ot> seutje: DataTables (table plug-in for jQuery) â https://datatables.net/
[07:36:32] <phelix> fiveofoh: You around by chance?
[07:37:13] <BillCriswell> murosai_: You probably want .length?
[07:38:17] <BillCriswell> murosai_: I never knew there was a .size(), but I looked it up and it's deprecated.
[07:40:34] <murosai_> nah the problem was $(this) instead of this
[07:41:56] <BillCriswell> Oh, missed that somehow haha... well .size() is still deprecated haha
[07:51:28] <jop008> unsupported pseudo: contains-ci
[07:51:45] <jop008> I want to check the contents of a td cell
[07:52:10] <BillCriswell> To contain what?
[07:52:13] <jop008> what is the proper way to test if a text is in a td cell?
[07:52:28] <jop008> text by user entered
[07:52:55] <BillCriswell> :contains('some text') for the pseudo
[07:53:38] <BillCriswell> $('td').filter(function(){ return $(this).text().indexOf('needle') > -1; }); for filter.
[07:55:49] <didge> How do I declare a global function from within the ready event ?  Is it $.varname = function() ?  I don't recall.
[07:56:49] <Cork> didge: window.name = function() {};
[07:57:25] <didge> Cork: oh wow!  wouldn't have guessed.
[07:57:33] <effortDee> :)
[07:57:37] <didge> Cork: then it's called with window.name ?
[07:57:46] <Cork> or just name()
[07:58:29] <didge> oh good.  I have a function named maticulate() because it reminds me of the old sim city initialization routine where the woman used to say "maticulating spline".  I remember that I always wanted to maticulate() something.
[07:58:31] <didge> ok.  thanks.
[08:01:08] <gavroche> hi
[08:01:45] <tekky> Howdy, having an odd issue with jQuery UI Sliders.... if the drag handle is resized (say its 20% of the slider width) the mouse tracking is always off by a little bit.. IE: it always locks to the left edge of the slider or.... farther left
[08:02:30] <gavrochel> is it possible to call a function on a click on a button that is created using append ?
[08:02:37] <evangeline> hi
[08:02:42] <jop008> I have emulated the search but no search on the fly is done
[08:03:19] <Cork> gavrochel: use delegated event listener
[08:03:43] <Cork> ?api delegate
[08:03:44] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[08:03:44] <mehrdad> hello, anyone know how can i set colmodel options via method call in jqgrid ?
[08:03:48] <evangeline> I'm adding a button to a table like this: $(".search-table").append('<tr><td>'+value+'</td><td><button class="run">Add</button></td></tr>');   ... and then I've have a $('.run').click(function() { }  function that is called when a button is clicked on ... but this doesn't happen in my case: would it be because I'm adding the button dynamically to the table ?
[08:04:18] <mehrdad> or maybe it's just useless, must be done another way.
[08:04:19] <Cork> evangeline: yes, add a delegated event listener to the table
[08:05:28] <BillCriswell> evangeline: $('.search-table').on('click', '.run', doSomething);
[08:05:44] <ruukasu> I have <script src="jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script> at the beginning of my <head>, but when I enter $ in the javascript console I get `function o()` and nothing from jquery works
[08:05:46] <BillCriswell> in doSomething `this` will be the button you clicked.
[08:05:58] <ruukasu> I know for sure the file is in the right place
[08:06:05] <Cork> ruukasu: most likely the console redefines $
[08:06:09] <Cork> ruukasu: try jQuery()
[08:06:22] <ruukasu> jQuery
[08:06:22] <ruukasu> function o()
[08:06:28] <Cork> O_o
[08:06:44] <Cork> link?
[08:06:53] <ruukasu> it's local
[08:07:50] <ruukasu> but if I `ls jquery-2.1.0.min.js` in the directory of my index.html it shows up
[08:07:59] <ruukasu> it's the right filename for sure
[08:08:15] <gavrochel> like always Cork you are the best ! Thank you!
[08:08:35] <evangeline> Cork, BillCriswell  works thank you: but how can I now detect which run button (on which row) was clicked, so I can pull out the name of the first column ?
[08:08:57] <Cork> ruukasu: check in the network tab in the browser and make sure it is actually loaded
[08:09:01] <Cork> and is the correct file
[08:09:22] <BillCriswell> evangeline: $(this) = button you clicked.
[08:09:51] <BillCriswell> Same as doing $('.search-table .run')
[08:09:51] <ruukasu> Cork, http://a.pomf.se/ldnlns.png
[08:09:53] <ruukasu> even after reload
[08:10:46] <Cork> ruukasu: can't really help you without any info
[08:11:22] <ruukasu> Cork, I don't suppose you use cjdns?
[08:11:29] <ruukasu> don't have a server or access to port forwarding
[08:11:40] <Cork> don't even know what it is
[08:11:50] <ruukasu> ;_;
[08:12:17] <evangeline> BillCriswell, this works yes: $('.search-table .run').html("Added"); ... but the name of all Run buttons in every row is changed ... how to change only the name of the button of the clicked upon button ?
[08:12:49] <Cork> ruukasu: but it looks like something isn't working as it should
[08:13:11] <Cork> ruukasu: also testing without a webserver isn't really supported in browsers today
[08:13:24] <Cork> ruukasu: you should set up a normal server (and use absolute paths for the files)
[08:13:50] <ruukasu> it's just html, css, and js, why would it require a server?
[08:13:59] <effortDee> hi Cork i know you've been busy today but i have another question: I have the date set up in a user extended field for a new registered person so I know when they registered.  I now want to set up a loop which will go through these fields and find the date of registration and check whether that date is within the last 30 days
[08:14:30] <Cork> in js?!?
[08:14:36] <tekky> ruukasu: google browser local file security... plenty of information explaining why....
[08:14:53] <effortDee> i have it set up in jqery
[08:14:55] <effortDee> jquery*
[08:15:04] <BillCriswell> evangeline: You modify it.
[08:15:06] <Cork> effortDee: security doesn't belong in js
[08:15:24] <Cork> effortDee: cause security implemented in js is pointless
[08:15:24] <effortDee> mmm
[08:15:35] <evangeline> BillCriswell, so I must add an id="1", id="2", .. to each row in a table ?
[08:15:37] <effortDee> security*? sorry am i missing something
[08:15:37] <Cork> you NEED to have that server side
[08:15:38] <ruukasu> effortDee, that would be extremely easy for the user to get around
[08:15:45] <effortDee> ruukasu
[08:15:47] <effortDee> i know
[08:15:59] <Cork> effortDee: you want to limit registration to 30 days
[08:15:59] <BillCriswell> evangeline: No. Just do $(this).text('Some new button text');
[08:16:07] <effortDee> i've been talking to other developers where i work, project managers and its the only way we can go about it
[08:16:08] <Cork> effortDee: that need to be done server side
[08:16:37] <effortDee> i cant do it server side because the CMS we are using doesn't collect user registration date or anything like that
[08:16:39] <Cork> effortDee: you are painting shit and calling it hotdog...
[08:16:46] <NoiseEee> effortDee: otherwise i just open my browser, change some stuff and hey, i can do what i want
[08:16:51] <Cork> it isn't even fake security
[08:16:54] <effortDee> Cork, we aren't calling it hotdog we know what it is :)
[08:17:04] <effortDee> fake security>
[08:17:05] <effortDee> ?
[08:17:16] <BillCriswell> evangeline: http://jsbin.com/nexuxepo/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:17:21] <Cork> effortDee: you want to do integrity control client side
[08:17:26] <Cork> and that is REALLY bad
[08:17:35] <ruukasu> Cork, http://a.pomf.se/exqmzk.png
[08:17:46] <effortDee> i know :( please dont spite me
[08:17:54] <effortDee> our fingers are tied
[08:17:57] <effortDee> as i said before
[08:18:01] <Cork> ruukasu: ya, looks like its loading
[08:18:04] <effortDee> we cant even cache clear the cms unless we book it
[08:18:14] <effortDee> and that takes 24hours and it can only ever be done at 9am mon-thu
[08:18:14] <Cork> ruukasu: can't say much more then that
[08:18:19] <effortDee> np guys :)
[08:18:23] <ruukasu> weird, I'll try redownloading it
[08:19:05] <tekky> having an odd issue with jQuery UI Sliders.... if the drag handle is resized (say its 20% of the slider width) the mouse tracking is always off... IE: it always locks to the left edge of the slider or.... ahead of the slide handle never where you actually click... any ideas on how to fix this?
[08:19:07] <Cork> ruukasu: sounds like you should proxy the request over a server where you can implement this correctly
[08:19:24] <Cork> ruukasu: cause what your doing is ugg...
[08:19:25] <BillCriswell> evangeline: Am I following you right?
[08:19:26] <tekky> effortDee: wow, sounds that sounds like pretty crappy service :/
[08:19:33] <Cork> opps wrong nick
[08:19:34] <evangeline> BillCriswell, thank you that works ... while I was using $('.search-table').click(function() { ... }, which didn't work
[08:19:38] <ruukasu> Cork, what's wrong with having the jquery.js local?
[08:19:43] <Cork> ruukasu: sorry wrong nick
[08:19:45] <effortDee> tekky this is one of the biggest CMS in the world, charge Â£6000 a month to their clients for using it
[08:19:50] <ruukasu> ah
[08:19:51] <Cork> effortDee: sounds like you should proxy the request over a server where you can implement this correctly
[08:20:03] <Cork> effortDee: cause what your doing is ugg...
[08:20:16] <effortDee> can't because we don't own the servers, the CMS do and you have to have white listed IP to do anything
[08:20:36] <effortDee> once our internet went down and we changed our IP here and it took days for them to whitelist our new IPs
[08:20:38] <NoiseEee> congratulate your 'superiors' on their choice of CMS
[08:20:43] <Cork> effortDee: so put another server infront of it where you can do sane integrity checking
[08:20:43] <NoiseEee> thumbs up
[08:20:44] <effortDee> NoiseEee
[08:20:49] <effortDee> we use magento/wordpress/modx
[08:20:52] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee++
[08:20:59] <effortDee> but this other CMS, clients come to us
[08:21:09] <effortDee> asking for us to amend their already hosted site
[08:21:14] <effortDee> NoiseEee++
[08:21:25] <effortDee> we make good money from it, its just VERY VERY secure
[08:21:38] <effortDee> i hope you never have to deal with it
[08:21:39] <effortDee> anyways
[08:21:40] <effortDee> thanks
[08:21:42] <NoiseEee> well maybe redirect to a different app in the meantime or something; i mean, you're SOL. you can't expect to do that stuff clientside with any integrity
[08:21:53] <effortDee> we know
[08:21:58] <effortDee> we told the client we cant do this
[08:22:03] <Cork> then why are you trying to sell that to the customer...
[08:22:08] <effortDee> we aren't
[08:22:15] <effortDee> we told the client we didnt' want to do it, cant do it etc
[08:22:28] <Nallown> hey guys whats going on?
[08:22:33] <effortDee> they said could you do it if it was hacky
[08:22:38] <NoiseEee> effortDee: so you'll find your answer with natural JS, the Date object
[08:22:46] <effortDee> yer am looking at that now
[08:22:52] <NoiseEee> effortDee: moment.js might have some shortcuts/conveniences
[08:22:53] <effortDee> used jquery .now for the date
[08:22:55] <effortDee> working from that
[08:23:08] <evangeline> BillCriswell, why doesn't the  $('.search-table').click(function() {}); work ?
[08:23:10] <effortDee> i appreciate your words but there is nothing i can do about this cms
[08:23:15] <effortDee> :))
[08:23:19] <effortDee> have a nice day everyone!
[08:23:22] <effortDee> and thanks again
[08:23:42] <Cork> evangeline: $('.search-table') will collect all element that the selector matches in an array
[08:23:58] <Cork> evangeline: .click will then loop that array and add an event listener
[08:24:17] <Cork> evangeline: meaning if the element didn't exist when $('.search-table') ran, it won't have an event listener
[08:24:41] <Cork> evangeline: the solution like BillCriswell pointed out, is to bind the event listener to a parent
[08:24:56] <Cork> and tell it to look for event that comes from a child matching a selector
[08:25:02] <BillCriswell> I just pretend shoveled for like 10 seconds
[08:25:08] <BillCriswell> Why was I doing that.
[08:25:31] <evangeline> Cork, ah I understand, thank you very much, that clears everything
[08:25:37] <evangeline> BillCriswell, thank you
[08:25:45] <BillCriswell> evangeline: No problem!
[08:27:50] <ankurk_> It's snowing like hell today :/
[08:28:26] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: ... interesting wording.
[08:28:38] <tekky> now if only snow could answer questions about Sliders... :P
[08:28:39] <BillCriswell> Hell finally froze over.
[08:29:05] <tucan> hmm, I see some code that uses Modernizr.js and looked up what it is, seems to be a lib that detects what html5/css3 features the browser supports, but is this jquery based?
[08:29:15] <ankurk_> what's so interesting about the wording? o.O
[08:29:29] <BillCriswell> snow in hell
[08:29:46] <BillCriswell> tucan: Nope.
[08:30:18] <tucan> do people still Modernizr?
[08:30:25] <tucan> it seems to be dating from 2012
[08:30:32] <tekky> people that support IE probably...
[08:31:15] <BillCriswell> tucan: We use it, usually very trimmed down though.
[08:31:28] <BillCriswell> It really depends on the project.
[08:32:31] <evangeline> BillCriswell, one more thing: how would I get the value of the first column in the same line as where the button was clicked: if I print $(this).parent(), it prints: td, prevObject: o.fn.init[1], context: button, jquery: "2.1.0", constructor: function, selector: ""â¦]  ... so I cannot get a parent tr row with it?
[08:32:55] <evangeline> http://jsbin.com/nexuxepo/2/edit
[08:33:12] <BillCriswell> evangeline: You'd want to go two parents up, but you can use .closest instead. so like... $(this).closest('tr').find('td').eq(0)
[08:37:56] <Nallown> guys i need help
[08:38:08] <Nallown> http://5.175.138.115/tst/
[08:38:12] <jwmann> Can someone help me troubleshoot why this weird visual bug happens when this animates? It only happens in Chrome - http://jsfiddle.net/tJYSw/1/
[08:38:17] <Nallown> try dragging around a note
[08:38:27] <ruukasu> Nallown, need a password
[08:38:33] <Nallown> o soz gimme a sec
[08:38:48] <Nallown> try now
[08:39:05] <evangeline> BillCriswell, thank you, works perfectly
[08:39:22] <Nallown> so basically in background it has a loop going which gets data in ajax
[08:39:37] <Nallown> and i created a method which stops the loop
[08:39:50] <Nallown> but the issue is that wherever i try calling that method it just won't correctly
[08:39:52] <BillCriswell> evangeline: No problem.
[08:40:21] <Nallown> so on sortable start stop timer
[08:40:27] <Nallown> but that won't work
[08:40:37] <Nallown> http://5.175.138.115/tst/js/scripts.js
[08:40:46] <Nallown> line 29
[08:40:58] <Nallown> is that correct?
[08:43:07] <Nallown> how could i solve that issue?
[08:43:11] <NoiseEee> Nallown: wait, let me just manually count those lines.
[08:43:20] <NoiseEee> ie: use a real pastebin or a JS fiddle
[08:43:30] <Nallown> alright gimme a sec xD
[08:43:42] <seutje> there's a chrome extension that'll pretty print it :P
[08:43:49] <Nallown> http://pastebin.com/bQuE6PAv
[08:44:10] <seutje> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/prettyprint/nipdlgebaanapcphbcidpmmmkcecpkhg?hl=en
[08:44:14] <mehrdad> how do you subscribe to triggered events in jqgrid?
[08:44:28] <seutje> lol, 29 is empty
[08:44:38] <Nallown> 0.0
[08:44:41] <Nallown> wut?
[08:44:48] <Nallown> line 29 has start
[08:44:55] <Nallown> start function ....
[08:46:38] <seutje> Nallown: is this suppose to cancel the timer whilst ur sorting, re-init it when done??
[08:46:49] <Nallown> yerp
[08:48:03] <Nallown> so it'll loop through a ajax get request and while moving card around it'll pause the loop and when done moving it'll continue
[08:48:55] <seutje> continue, or re-initialize?
[08:49:12] <Nallown> continue
[08:50:08] <Nallown> seutje: so pause mycode() while dragging, continue on finish
[08:50:21] <seutje> pausing setTimeout is a bit annoying
[08:50:40] <Nallown> seutje: what's a better way of doing this?
[08:50:57] <seutje> you'd actually need to create a timer class or something that know how long the previous timeout has been running when u pause it
[08:51:21] <seutje> Nallown: well, frankly, ur not even waiting for the ajax call to return before initializing a new one
[08:51:25] <gx> anyone know what could cause jqui tooltips to ONLY display on the top? i've tried position: 'right' and a multitude of other things, but nothing's working
[08:51:34] <seutje> so on a really slow connection, you'd be ranking up more and more requests
[08:52:04] <Nallown> seutje: so should i init the timer on ajax success?
[08:52:22] <seutje> probably
[08:52:46] <Nallown> seutje: ok that's a good point but the timer still would be running while dragging
[08:53:07] <Nallown> seutje: the main issue that im having right now is that it won't stop the loop while dragging
[08:54:13] <Nallown> I tried sortable - on sort, start > stop
[08:54:31] <Nallown> but that won't stop the timer
[08:56:09] <Nallown> seutje: any idea how I could do that?
[09:01:00] <tekky> can anyone explain why http://jsfiddle.net/jmQ8n/1/ -- the slider jumps when you start dragging it by roughly 50% of the width of the handle?
[09:01:41] <duch_kazatel> woah.  positioning is all fuinky.
[09:01:42] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[09:02:17] <Nallown> the slider itself isn't centered
[09:02:24] <tekky> duch_kazatel: yeah I found an old issue that seemed to address it but I checked and that fix is definitely in our version
[09:02:43] <seutje> Nallown: hmz, not entire sure what's going wrong here, try putting a debugger statement in the abortTimer function to see if it gets called at all
[09:03:49] <Nallown> added a console log on abort
[09:04:40] <duch_kazatel> removing the width change fixes it.  hrm...
[09:04:52] <Jared_> Hey Ben,
[09:05:04] <Jared_> Here are my notes from class today on 'this'
[09:05:04] <tekky> Nallown: in other words, jquery-ui slider doesn't support custom width drag handles?
[09:05:10] <seutje> tekky: removing the width off the slider handle works for me
[09:05:16] <Guest93760> THIS  how to determine this  - bind: function.prototype.bind -- returns fx with 'this' value (when invoked) - call: function.prototype.call -- invokes fx with a 'this' value - apply: function.prototype.apply __/ - obj.method(); -- this === obj in method -> invoke and dereference in SAME expression - function(); -- this === window technically undefined but forces to global window     \_ if strictmode: 'use strict'; this===undefined  
[09:05:37] <tekky> seutje: I wouldn't have added the width if it wasn't important to the test...
[09:05:54] <Nallown> tekky: well yes it sort of does but you'd need to position it -halfWidth
[09:06:33] <seutje> tekky: if ur gonna fuck with the width, also fuck with the negative left margin
[09:07:01] <seutje> and since u moved away from the usual EMs used, good luck determining the negative margin on a 20% wide element!
[09:07:25] <Nallown> tekky: just do margin-left: -HalfWidth
[09:07:38] <seutje> -10%?
[09:07:49] <Nallown> if width is 20% then yes
[09:08:26] <seutje> yeah, seems to work
[09:08:48] <seutje> tekky: thing is, it tries to put the center of the slider on the position that would represent the chosen value
[09:09:18] <seutje> so when u make it too wide, u get weird shit: http://jsfiddle.net/jmQ8n/2/
[09:09:30] <seutje> move it all the way to the left, let it go and move ur mouse back to the right
[09:09:46] <seutje> is that desired?
[09:10:01] <shakeofabiomen> can i use jquery to set the background image as data-url for a div
[09:10:05] <Nallown> you could add padding left-right 10% on the bar you scroll the scollbar on
[09:10:36] <seutje> hehe, if u grab the left side of it and drag it to the left, u can't get to the 0 value
[09:10:44] <seutje> same with grabbing the right side and dragging to the right
[09:10:53] <Nallown> yea
[09:10:58] <tekky> seutje: we already take into account the overflow of the handle -- just couldn't track down the odd mouse positioning (was looking more at a JS fix than a CSS fix)
[09:11:04] <Nallown> thats why you should add padding to left and right
[09:11:33] <duch_kazatel> tekky it's a css issue.
[09:11:47] <duch_kazatel> so js is not the appropriate fix.
[09:11:48] <seutje> tekky: well, like I said, if ur gonna mess with the default styles, make sure u know what else is influenced by that
[09:11:59] <Nallown> tekky: Soz i meant margin
[09:12:01] <Nallown> see this sample
[09:12:08] <Nallown> http://jsfiddle.net/jmQ8n/3/
[09:13:06] <tekky> seutje: this is more representative of how ours is, http://jsfiddle.net/jmQ8n/4/ (you can still drag full range due to not being at a screen/frame break)
[09:13:49] <Nallown> tekky: instead of hardcoding the width just add margin to left and right of 10%
[09:14:10] <Nallown> http://jsfiddle.net/jmQ8n/3/
[09:14:15] <Nallown> like so^ tekky
[09:14:32] <seutje> I'ma assume that was to illustrate, cause setting a fixed width kinda defeats the whole purpose of making it a %
[09:14:59] <thoraxe> hmm... i have an old library jquery.form-defaults.js and it doesn't have any comments in it about where it came from.  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9510257 -- DefaultValue does not appear to be part of anything, so I'm wondering if in the latest jquery there's a good/proper way to set the default values for a form field
[09:15:17] <tekky> seutje:  exactly :P
[09:15:29] <Nallown> tekky: thats why you should add margin of 10% instead
[09:16:03] <tekky> Nallown / seutje thanks for the help, definitely got me back on track -- approached this from the wrong angle and way overcomplicated it. Ya'll got me back on track :)
[09:16:18] <seutje> my pleasure
[09:16:21] <Nallown> alright no probs
[09:16:22] <thoraxe> it doesn't apepar to work with jquery-1.11.0 either
[09:16:26] <seutje> I should rly get going though
[09:16:39] <Nallown> seutje: what about my issue though lol?
[09:16:57] <Morl0ck> damn, thats dirty
[09:18:45] <Nallown> well guys cya then
[09:18:52] <duch_kazatel> Nallown what was your issue?
[09:19:00] <Nallown> http://5.175.138.115/tst/
[09:19:12] <redskydown1> hi. how to I bind class method to an element?
[09:19:22] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 huh?
[09:19:23] <Nallown> basically theres a loop which updates loads from the db
[09:19:42] <Nallown> but since it may load while dragging you get a error
[09:19:48] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[09:19:59] <duch_kazatel> why are you continually updating like that?
[09:20:10] <BillCriswell> guys
[09:20:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hahahahahahahaha
[09:20:30] <Nallown> because that's the simplest way I could find of doing it
[09:20:35] <duch_kazatel> doing what?
[09:20:43] <Nallown> realtime updates
[09:20:57] <duch_kazatel> yopu're only going to have issues if doing it that way.
[09:21:03] <BillCriswell> response from ajax not setting to var
[09:21:05] <BillCriswell> help
[09:21:23] <redskydown1> duch_kazatel: I have my plugin $.fn.mapify = function(){â¦} and I want to execute method in it like #('#mymap').mapify(); #('#mymap').resetMarker()
[09:21:43] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 you you want to write a plugin?
[09:22:16] <Nallown> what's another way of having it update in realtime efficiently?
[09:22:17] <redskydown1> yeah I did but the method inside are not available to the element
[09:22:17] <duch_kazatel> Nallown you should either look into sockets or not do "realtime".
[09:22:28] <Nallown> That's what im trying to avoid
[09:22:31] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 okay - share your code.
[09:22:42] <Nallown> I use sockets in java all the time and are fine in there
[09:22:56] <duch_kazatel> Nallown what you've got now is going to become slower and slower as time goes on.
[09:23:06] <duch_kazatel> timeouts are generally indicative of a a design problem.
[09:23:27] <Nallown> duch_kazatel: yea i noticed that i wasn't happy using timeouts aswell
[09:23:43] <duch_kazatel> so either use an alternative mechanism, or don't do "realtime"
[09:24:44] <Nallown> I don't see jquery having any socket support though
[09:25:15] <Nallown> unless i use a secondary library for that
[09:25:18] <duch_kazatel> right... that's not what jquery does.
[09:26:52] <redskydown1> duch_kazatel: http://paste2.org/OXYII568
[09:27:36] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 sorry, i should have clarified - can you setup something like a fiddle and demonstrate the actaul problem?
[09:27:56] <Nallown> I can see someone dragging the notes around lol
[09:28:07] <Morl0ck> Nallown: ME!
[09:28:12] <Nallown> lol
[09:28:31] <Nallown> even though it's not efficient it's quiet exciting
[09:29:10] <duch_kazatel> Nallown you should really rethink your approach.
[09:29:34] <Nallown> duch_kazatel: Yea don't worry I wasn't really planning on using a timeout system in the final product anyway
[09:29:43] <Nallown> this is more of a prototype
[09:30:17] <Nallown> that's why the js is all messy
[09:30:38] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* "hey guys i'm having this problem how do i solve it?" "well, you should not do what you're doing." "well, of course, this is just a prototype."
[09:31:01] <Morl0ck> Nallown: omg my reminders are gone!
[09:31:13] <Morl0ck> Nallown: nvm they're back
[09:31:13] <Nallown> lol
[09:31:56] <Nallown> also if you manage to change the value of days before it reloads then it would update aswell
[09:32:59] <Morl0ck> Nallown: whats this for? seems pretty cool
[09:33:16] <Nallown> just some project i'm working on
[09:33:29] <Nallown> using my works server ssshttt don't tell anyone
[09:34:03] <Morl0ck> Nallown i changed all the days
[09:34:10] <Nallown> yerp see it
[09:35:24] <Morl0ck> oh man, the <ul><li>s are flickering every 500ms
[09:35:35] <Nallown> yerp
[09:35:46] <Nallown> that's how it works right now for the realtime update
[09:36:17] <Nallown> duch_kazatel: I'm reading about js sockets right now but i'm wondering where would i send the information from?
[09:37:15] <duch_kazatel> Nallown the server.
[09:37:25] <Nallown> duch_kazatel: I mean in java you'd have a server sending the information but how would it work in js?
[09:37:38] <redskydown1> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/A8QYF/
[09:37:42] <Nallown> duch_kazatel: yea i know but would this mean that i'd have to host a js server?
[09:37:59] <Nallown> because isn't the point of js to be client side?
[09:38:02] <duch_kazatel> no...
[09:39:04] <Nallown> redskydown1: I don't use canvas but to me it seems like you havn't defined canvasMap
[09:39:39] <duch_kazatel> deleteMarkets isn't defined.
[09:40:06] <redskydown1> my probleme is if I do  $('#map-canvas').mapify().deleteMarkers(); method is run but plugin is reinitialised each time
[09:41:01] <duch_kazatel> right - instead of cluttering up your namespace like that, pass an object to the function instead that has various options in it and parse those out to determine what you want instead.
[09:41:37] <redskydown1> eee
[09:42:36] <duch_kazatel> there's a reason you don't often see people setting up methods that way.
[09:46:36] <Nallown> so duch_kazatel, do html5 web sockets send data client to client?
[09:47:01] <Nallown> so e.g. the client send "whatever" then client himself would collect "whatever"
[09:47:13] <duch_kazatel> Nallown no.  you still need a server for that.
[09:47:18] <duch_kazatel> last i checked.
[09:48:29] <jop008> Can you change data-mode="columntoggle"  on the fly?
[09:48:44] <jop008> not on mobile I don't want it visible
[09:49:44] <Nallown> aah so a websocket works with both php and js
[09:49:53] <duch_kazatel> websocket is just a standard.
[09:50:19] <duch_kazatel> as long as you conform to the standard, you can use any server, really.
[09:50:37] <jop008> with this you can .ui-table-columntoggle-btn {
[09:50:38] <jop008>     display: none !important;
[09:50:38] <jop008> }
[09:50:50] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ jop008
[09:50:50] <b-ot> jop008: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:51:08] <jop008> 2 lines?
[09:51:29] <duch_kazatel> that was three, and it makes things hard to read depending on how your IRC client is configured.
[09:51:31] <redskydown1> is there any exemple I can read that do something like I want?
[09:51:57] <redskydown1> I found lot of easy plugin tutorial but none show me how to properly extend an element
[09:52:26] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 to do what you want, you need to effectively create two plugins.
[09:58:27] <zumba_addict> in .promise, can I have two values in the when parameter? example $.when( effect1(), effect2()).done(function() {});
[09:58:40] <redskydown1> can I have an exemple duch_kazatel?
[09:59:03] <duch_kazatel> redskydown1 of what?
[09:59:16] <clime> Hey, If I add "defer" to each of my <script scr> tags, will loading order of the scripts be kept? it seems to be kept when I look at requests how the go one after another. However I have been getting javascripts error about undefined function (probably $) since I added defer: https://dpaste.de/YY19
[09:59:52] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict yep - https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ "In the case where multiple Deferred objects are passed to jQuery.when, the method returns the Promise from a new "master" Deferred object that tracks the aggregate state of all the Deferreds it has been passed."
[10:00:03] <zumba_addict> thanks
[10:04:02] <tirengarfio> im using     $('article').each(function(){      $(this).text($(this).html());    }); to convert text to html, but, for example, <p> is being converted to &lt;p&gt;. Any help?
[10:07:36] <NoiseEee> to convert text to html?
[10:08:30] <Cork> tirengarfio: <p> is meant to be converted to &lt;p&gt;
[10:08:50] <Cork> tirengarfio: or do you mean it get double converted?
[10:09:36] <Cork> meaning <p> => &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
[10:11:05] <RedSkyDown1> oups sorry lost my connection
[10:15:07] <jop008> how to select <div class=ui-body and the the first <a href tag?
[10:15:32] <Cork> first a tag?
[10:15:38] <Cork> first child of the div?
[10:17:25] <BillCriswell> $('.ui-body,a:eq(0)') ? Seems weird ot need both of them with one selector
[10:18:12] <NoiseEee> jop008: how do you think you *might* do that
[10:18:24] <NoiseEee> jop008: what, 6 weeks now and still asking the most rudimentary, basic "selector" questions
[10:18:33] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee++
[10:18:38] <NoiseEee> in one ear, out the other
[10:18:55] <duch_kazatel> dude also PMs you without asking first.  event after you've told him to not PM you without asking.
[10:18:56] <jop008> filter each such like that but the syntax is not that EZ
[10:19:10] <duch_kazatel> the syntax is way easy dude.
[10:19:38] <duch_kazatel> jop008 learn to use the docs.
[10:20:07] <jop008> but the exact syntax I will never learn to many variant
[10:20:17] <NoiseEee> its always the same, like css
[10:20:59] <duch_kazatel> jop008 learn the syntax and how to use the docs.
[10:21:24] <duch_kazatel> and then you don't need to use chat.
[10:22:15] <NoiseEee> jop008: do you even understand any of the answers given to you over the last two months?  or you just take 'em and see what works?
[10:22:23] <duch_kazatel> he's coding by google.
[10:22:32] <NoiseEee> this channel needs a 'help vampire' list
[10:22:45] <duch_kazatel> agreeds.
[10:22:47] <duch_kazatel> *agreed
[10:24:28] <duch_kazatel> and the "guys" list
[10:24:41] <RedSkyDown1> duch_kazatel: I didnt see if you have answered me. lost my connection.
[10:24:45] <jop008> I can use this $("div").filter(".ui-body");
[10:24:51] <tirengarfio> Cork, I have solved with       $(this).html($(this).text());, at the beginning I had $(this).html($(this).text()); :)
[10:24:55] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown1 which question?
[10:25:00] <duch_kazatel> jop008 did you try?
[10:25:11] <tirengarfio> sorry, $(this).text($(this).html());
[10:25:12] <duch_kazatel> jop008 are you asking us for info and then trying, or are you actually trying first?
[10:25:26] <Cork> tirengarfio: i don't really see the difference...
[10:25:33] <RedSkyDown1> if you have an exemple for 2 plugins use for extend an element
[10:25:52] <duch_kazatel> RedSkyDown1 you did the first one.  you'd create the second plugin the same way...
[10:25:54] <Cork> tirengarfio: ya, saw that, and that makes some sense
[10:25:58] <duch_kazatel> but again, that's a bad idea.
[10:26:13] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:26:21] <zumba_addict> anyone here uses slack.com? I think I like it. What are your thoughts? I like the integration with git
[10:26:53] <BillCriswell> Just learned you can drag and drop elements in the element inspector.
[10:27:00] <BillCriswell> What the hell is wrong with my brain.
[10:27:21] <RedSkyDown1> ok but how other plugin work than? I want to have an instance of my plugin by element
[10:27:37] <jop008> both
[10:27:49] <RedSkyDown1> and I dont want it to reinitialize it each time.
[10:28:36] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: they generate data per element and store it in data() most of the time
[10:29:13] <Cork> this.each(function() { var data = $(this).data('my-plugin'); })
[10:30:33] <RedSkyDown1> ok
[10:37:54] <decx> help vampire, i like it
[10:39:16] <RedSkyDown1> thank Cork. I think it will do it for what I need.
[10:39:50] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: it can handle it how ever complex you needs are
[10:40:11] <Cork> even if it needs to go as far as $(this).data('my-plugin', new PluginModule(options));
[10:40:14] <Cork> :)
[10:40:57] <RedSkyDown1> its exactly what I have in mind
[10:42:40] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: and with a small wrapper you can do something like $(this).data('my-plugin')[function_name].apply(null, arguments)
[10:43:16] <Cork> (you will have to crop the arguments array from the first variable to not send the function name to the function)
[10:43:23] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: i often do this in plugins
[10:43:29] <Cork> gives you a nice interface for it
[10:43:59] <RedSkyDown1> Cork do you have git plugin I can check for as exemple?
[10:44:08] <iateadonut> i'm trying to find out what the nth is of the selected option
[10:44:08] <iateadonut> $(this).children("option:selected").giveEq() - something like that.
[10:44:24] <BinaryKi1ten> nth?
[10:44:29] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: i don't think i have that line in git no
[10:44:39] <BinaryKi1ten> oh
[10:44:41] <BinaryKi1ten> the index
[10:44:50] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: but it is quite simple
[10:45:14] <jop008> I did this oel = $("a:nth-child(2)");
[10:47:12] <BinaryKi1ten> iateadonut var items = $(this).children('option'), selectedItem = items.filter(':selected'), index = items.index(selectedItem);
[10:48:46] <iateadonut> perfect, thanks.
[10:48:48] <iateadonut> doing $(this).children("option:selected").index()
[10:49:15] <BinaryKi1ten> ah yes
[10:49:22] <BinaryKi1ten> "If no argument is passed to the .index() method, the return value is an integer indicating the position of the first element within the jQuery object relative to its sibling elements"
[10:50:39] <duch_kazatel> ooh, we really need a "commonly asked questions" bot command.  stuff like !delegation and !version
[10:50:40] <duch_kazatel> etc.
[10:53:32] <Qiller> hi all, can i use easing events using mousewhell plugin?
[10:53:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: ajpiano's http://fixingthesejquery.com/ handles lots of the stuff we help people with
[10:53:48] <duch_kazatel> fair enough.
[10:54:14] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/dL6En/
[10:54:25] <Cork> RedSkyDown1: though i modify it depending on my needs a bit
[10:54:40] <Cork> (if i need to be able to return different values from it and so on)
[10:54:47] <Cork> but this is the simplest form i use
[10:55:37] <decx> what's up with the {} in the first line?
[10:55:53] <Cork> ... jsfiddle
[10:55:54] <mehrdad_> wtf is up with nivo slider?
[10:55:57] <Cork> auto closing { >_<
[10:56:16] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dL6En/1/
[10:56:20] <mehrdad_> always have to tinker with its css to not mess up the images
[10:56:26] <Cork> editing in jsfiddle is a mess sometimes
[10:56:32] <mehrdad_> first zoomed in, and then jumps to original image size
[10:56:45] <mehrdad_> and i have the correct w & h in the css style
[10:56:54] <mehrdad_> fixed to the image sizes
[10:57:21] <phelix> Could someone help me try to get this info. http://jsfiddle.net/ELPxC/1/
[10:57:33] <phelix> trying to display the id of the child element
[10:58:00] <RedSkyDown1> Cork: ok thank. its more clear now.
[10:58:12] <Cork> phelix: container isn't a form element
[10:58:15] <BillCriswell> phelix: What's the change for?
[10:58:17] <Cork> phelix: so change won't ever fire
[10:58:28] <duch_kazatel> phelix change only fires from forms.
[10:58:39] <phelix> well in full there is actually a slider on that div
[10:58:44] <Cork> duch_kazatel: form elements not forms :)
[10:58:54] <phelix> so when i move on that it slides the slider over.
[10:58:54] <Cork> ah
[10:59:08] <duch_kazatel> then supply a complete example ;)
[10:59:27] <Cork> phelix: jquery ui slider?
[10:59:30] <Qiller> hi all, can i use easing events using mousewhell plugin?
[10:59:44] <Cork> phelix: or are you talking about a slideshow?
[10:59:54] <duch_kazatel> Qiller care to clarify?  do you mean you want to use easing when the user is scrolling?
[11:00:12] <duch_kazatel> are you easing the scrolling itself?
[11:00:18] <Qiller> yes duch_kazatel
[11:00:29] * Cork wants to kill the developer that named there slideshow plugin "slider"...
[11:00:34] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/7/
[11:00:35] <mehrdad_> such a quirky slider
[11:00:39] <Qiller> using mousewheel plugin to scroll
[11:00:43] <mehrdad_> >.<
[11:00:49] <phelix> Cork: its nouislider
[11:01:11] <Cork> phelix: and is that a slider or a slideshow?
[11:01:16] <phelix> its a slider
[11:01:36] <duch_kazatel> nouislider is a slider plugin - gives you a way to have a range slider dealio.
[11:01:45] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: i need use "easeInOutSine" easing event when i scroll with mousewheel plugin.
[11:01:54] <phelix> I am really only trying to get the ID value of the first child of .slider-container
[11:02:15] <phelix> but inside this function
[11:02:34] <phelix> so here. http://jsfiddle.net/ELPxC/1/
[11:02:50] <phelix> inside my change function I am trying to set the ID of the child element to a variable
[11:04:17] <phelix> not sure if it can be done inside that function or if I need to do this inside of it a different way.
[11:04:20] <Cork> phelix: change isn't triggered for me there
[11:04:53] <phelix> I know it won't. But from looking at this can you see how I could grab the ID of the child element?
[11:05:02] <phelix> im trying to get this. "sample-change-keypress-464"
[11:05:08] <decx> first-child in this context doesnt apply to the first child inside slider-container
[11:05:15] <decx> just if .slider-container is the first child
[11:05:16] <phelix> ohh
[11:05:44] <phelix> do you know how to correct what I am trying to do here?
[11:05:55] <Cork> phelix: you can $().children().first().attr('id')
[11:06:02] <phelix> ahh ok
[11:06:05] <Cork> the problem is getting to know when you should search for it
[11:07:26] <decx> it's actually firing change like in a form element. the slider code must hook into there somewhere
[11:07:37] <decx> not liking that one bit tbh
[11:07:43] <jwmann> Can someone help me troubleshoot why this weird visual bug happens when this animates? It only happens in Chrome - http://jsfiddle.net/tJYSw/1/
[11:07:57] <duch_kazatel> this is nouislider, right?
[11:08:05] <phelix> ya
[11:08:10] <duch_kazatel> because it uses shadow dom for some of its voodoo magic.
[11:08:13] <jwmann> duch_kazatel: ^ This was what I was talking about a couple days back, you left just before I finished making the jsFiddle xP
[11:08:22] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I used fiveofoh's example from last night and was able to clean all this up
[11:08:36] <phelix> just trying to fine tune some of the options now. but that worked good for me last night
[11:08:36] <decx> ah, so it creates an hidden input in the shadows
[11:08:40] <decx> a*
[11:08:42] <phelix> ya
[11:08:55] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah it hides the inputs away, so to speak./
[11:09:03] <duch_kazatel> threw me for a loop the first time i saw it.
[11:10:50] <decx> jwmann do you mean the tearing on the text?
[11:11:27] <jwmann> decx: No, the semi-opaque rgba background goes super dark (Although, not completely black for some reason) when it animates
[11:11:48] <decx> can't confirm on chrome win
[11:12:07] <jwmann> Only happens in my Chrome on OSX 10.8.5
[11:12:15] <jwmann> AFAIK so far
[11:12:34] <jwmann> My Firefox works fine.
[11:12:52] <decx> i never actually used transition() what does it do?
[11:13:50] <jwmann> It's a method provided by jQuery Transit
[11:14:08] <jwmann> It allows you to have a callback function after the completion of a CSS3 transition
[11:14:25] <decx> ah
[11:14:32] <decx> i use the events for that
[11:14:35] <jwmann> It also gives you the option to fallback onto a jQuery animation should CSS3 not be supported
[11:14:47] <decx> animationEnd
[11:15:04] <decx> hm that is kinda nice
[11:15:06] <v0id3d> guys i was reading on w3 schools that you can create a jquery function file is this recommended?
[11:15:15] <Cork> jwmann: so you mean it isn't even happening in chrome, just chrome on osx?
[11:15:22] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d huh?
[11:15:27] <Cork> v0id3d: there is the first error
[11:15:31] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d avoid w3schools
[11:15:34] <duch_kazatel> that site is baaaad.
[11:15:35] <Cork> don't read w3cschools
[11:15:37] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/ELPxC/2/
[11:15:37] <v0id3d> hahaha
[11:15:42] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[11:15:44] <v0id3d> roger that

[11:15:48] <duch_kazatel> !g w3fools
[11:15:52] <duch_kazatel> hah, there we go.
[11:15:53] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: W3Fools â A W3Schools Intervention â http://www.w3fools.com/
[11:15:55] <jwmann> Cork: I'm assuming this is mac specific since decx says it doesn't happen in Chrome for windows
[11:16:05] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d so what is your actual question?
[11:16:12] <phelix> ok I found an easier way. Since I am trying to get the id all the items have the class of noUi-target so using this I was able to set the ID to myvar
[11:16:13] <Cork> jwmann: ya, it doesn't happen on linux either; that is why i asked
[11:16:25] <v0id3d> hahah i would rather read first
[11:16:26] <v0id3d> lol
[11:16:27] <decx> a separate file for functions just keeps your stuff a bit cleaner, it's all personal preference
[11:16:30] <phelix> but how can I combine that myvar to work with the next function?
[11:16:40] <decx> unless you have a style guide it doesnt matter
[11:16:45] <v0id3d> i want to keep it clean
[11:16:58] <jwmann> The error doesn't happen in Firefox or Opera
[11:16:58] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d huh?  if your question is "should I put my code in a js file and not in my html?", then the answer is "yesssss"
[11:17:00] <duch_kazatel> generally.
[11:17:11] <v0id3d> thanks
[11:17:14] <jwmann> Oddly enough, it doesn't happen on Safari either...
[11:17:17] <v0id3d> that is the question
[11:17:23] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d there you go, then.
[11:17:25] <jwmann> Which I find odd because Safari uses webkit as well
[11:17:28] <v0id3d> is there a good place to go read on this
[11:17:35] <v0id3d> how to do it properly and what not
[11:17:41] <duch_kazatel> chrome isn't on webkit any more technically.
[11:17:51] <Cork> v0id3d: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/ and http://learn.jquery.com/
[11:17:56] <jwmann> hmm ok
[11:17:57] <v0id3d> thanks
[11:18:02] <Cork> of you want good material :)
[11:19:20] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:19:34] <v0id3d> haha wish i woulda known bout w3 earlier
[11:20:56] <v0id3d> my god there is a chrome extentino to weed out w3 thats to much
[11:21:10] <Cork> v0id3d: ya, sadly they've been around since the 90's
[11:21:25] <Cork> and that gives them a lot of google juice
[11:21:31] <v0id3d> well off to reading thanks for the help haha
[11:21:33] <BillCriswell> Anyone here from Boston?
[11:22:12] <thang> sup
[11:22:13] <decx> their site hasnt been updated since the 90s as well
[11:22:36] <jwmann> Hmm, not sure what to do from here.. Contact Chrome forums? :S
[11:22:49] <Cork> decx: sure, but you can still find users that learn from that site by the confused questions
[11:23:10] <Cork> decx: it teaches to do things in the wrong way
[11:23:36] <Cork> decx: ex. they still push for using event attributes and not separating html and js
[11:23:47] <decx> duh, i'm just shooting banter over here
[11:24:48] <decx> people use it because it has clickable examples, as much as i love mdn, it's a bit technical
[11:25:11] <Cork> decx: there are other sites with examples
[11:25:40] <decx> i know that, you know that, but the millions driving up w3s traffic don't
[11:25:44] <Cork> and no, ppl use w3cschools cause it's more or less always the fist google result
[11:26:05] <duch_kazatel> learning to use MDN is a valuable skill.
[11:26:13] <duch_kazatel> learning documentation is a fantastic thing to do.
[11:26:22] <duch_kazatel> all people use w3schools for is copy/paste examples.
[11:26:42] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well ppl to learn from w3cschools
[11:26:47] <Cork> to==do
[11:26:53] <duch_kazatel> i have yet to see it personally.
[11:27:01] <Cork> the sad part is that they learn bad practices
[11:27:29] <Cork> but yes, the focus is a lot on copy and paste
[11:30:33] <ankurk_> W3Schools is terrible, that's what people don't understand
[11:32:21] <Cork> ya
[11:32:33] <Cork> ankurk_: but honestly, how would they?
[11:32:42] <duch_kazatel> and therein lies the problem.
[11:32:47] <Cork> google gives it as the first response on google searches
[11:32:50] <decx> do you part, link relevant stuff to mdn or a userfriendly alternative
[11:32:57] <decx> your*
[11:32:59] <v0id3d> Well i mean I have programming experience and i stay away from copy and paste would rather read so i have seen a few mistakes given in it personally it has helped with the very basics of getting my feet wet
[11:33:06] <Cork> when "experts" gives links in forums it is often to w3cschools
[11:33:13] <ankurk_> Newbies should be discouraged to use W3School in Universities or Colleges or Schools itself'
[11:33:51] <BillCriswell> I like that w3 schools mostly just get right to the point.
[11:33:56] <Cork> v0id3d: ya, this is not about you; i've actually been insulted for directing users away from w3cshools
[11:34:07] <BillCriswell> Even if it's not the sharpest point.
[11:34:40] <v0id3d> haha any learning material i can get i will ready plain and simple
[11:34:54] <v0id3d> Just off the link you sent me i realized that i am going about this in the wrong order
[11:34:59] <v0id3d> well what i am trying to do
[11:35:00] <v0id3d> so thanks
[11:35:07] <decx> agreed BillCriswell same reason that people come in here and ask for stuff that is right under the jquery ui example they just copied. the actual api documentation gets ignored
[11:35:23] <decx> they should make the link bigger
[11:35:23] <Cork> ya
[11:35:42] <Cork> though examples is good for getting users interested
[11:36:07] <Cork> they need to focus more about the info after the first interest shot has been delivered
[11:36:09] <decx> no doubt, but the "api documentation" doesn't look as important as it is
[11:36:14] <BillCriswell> Someone pointed this out to me yesterday, thought it was a good point. He was looking for localStorage examples: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage vs http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp
[11:36:15] <decx> *link
[11:36:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah, I feel like MDN needs a simplfied version made available.
[11:36:46] <Cork> decx: i've had ppl not seeing how the examples in jquery ui helps them
[11:36:55] <Cork> cause the example doesn't fit exactly to what they want to do
[11:37:06] <Cork> it's mainly lazyness i thing
[11:37:09] <decx> true
[11:37:09] <Cork> *think
[11:37:21] <duch_kazatel> it's more than they want results they can see.
[11:37:21] <ankurk_> So is it the problem with OSS or People themselves?
[11:37:24] <decx> and yes, mdn needs a simple. version akin to wikipedia
[11:37:42] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly where i was headed with that, decx :)
[11:37:48] <Cork> ankurk_: to a large degree it is they want it handed to them
[11:38:06] <Cork> prob cause of time pressure (i hope)
[11:38:31] <duch_kazatel> eh, i think it's more often that they want the quantifiable result of "there is a thing on my screen that is what I want" as quickly as possible.
[11:38:39] <duch_kazatel> without consideration for everything else that goes behind that
[11:39:07] <duch_kazatel> you do get the occasional "guys.  this thing doesn't do exactly what i want.  i need it now - here's my crazy, convoluted, bizarro fix."
[11:45:21] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i remember one guy asking how he could show a custom column in autocomplete (or add custom style, don't remember the specifics)
[11:45:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:45:40] <Cork> i pointed him to the custom rendering example for autocomplete
[11:45:45] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[11:46:02] <Cork> and he got mad cause it didn't help him cause  it didn't use the column/add the style he needed -_-'
[11:46:13] <Cork> that really made me lose fate in humanity for a while...
[11:46:17] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:52:27] <zumba_addict> off topic question guys :D what would be some nice 3 personal goals of a programmer? Need to enter mine by end of friday
[11:52:40] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you mostly do.
[11:53:20] <obert> zumba_addict: no payment, great skills in any topics, available during weekends
[11:53:32] <zumba_addict> hahaha :D
[11:53:38] <duch_kazatel> lol
[11:53:45] <csdc> how can i have multiline text in qtip2?
[11:53:55] <csdc> when i have more than one line of text, it breaks
[11:55:38] <obert> what is a decent jquery slideshow plugin? i forgot what i was using before
[11:55:49] <obert> i need to slide photo and text too
[11:56:14] <obert> responsive slideshow.
[11:57:58] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict depending on your skill level and what kind of stuff you're doing, you could always shoot to understand the jquery api better, learn the DOM APIs better, and learn how to write a constructor function or plugin or something.
[11:58:17] <zumba_addict> That's great
[11:58:35] <duch_kazatel> but again, it really depends.
[11:58:39] <zumba_addict> yup
[11:58:50] <zumba_addict> I was also thinking, learn new framework and use them
[11:58:55] <duch_kazatel> there's also "pick up some better design skills" or "learn about graceful degredation and progressive enhancement"
[11:59:03] <duch_kazatel> implement a new framework/library is a good one.
[11:59:07] <duch_kazatel> like backbone or riot or something
[11:59:08] <zumba_addict> wow, that sounds cool
[11:59:18] <zumba_addict> never heard of riot. We are using Backbone
[11:59:33] <duch_kazatel> riot's a very minimalistic MV*
[11:59:36] <duch_kazatel> brb tacos
[11:59:44] <BillCriswell> haha, "magin"
[11:59:57] <BillCriswell> Instead of margin... that would explain why that wasn't working
[12:00:01] <zumba_addict> it's only 1k
[12:00:27] <zumba_addict> have you used riot duch_kazatel?
[12:07:04] <obert> no hints for me?
[12:07:35] <Cork> obert: you asked for a decent one :)
[12:07:43] <Cork> obert: those are a rarity
[12:07:47] <obert> Cork: and?
[12:07:58] <Cork> slideshows is notoriously bad written
[12:08:08] <obert> Cork: gimme a direction. there are too many out there, tried 4 today and none is good
[12:08:24] <obert> gee
[12:08:32] <Cork> obert: i write the animation in css3 if i need ot
[12:08:34] <Cork> *it
[12:08:36] <obert> Cork: decent=that it works:p
[12:08:39] <Cork> i don't use those plugins
[12:09:19] <Cork> obert: some curiosa slideshow plugins is the reason jquery doesn't support requestAnimationFrame for animations
[12:09:21] <obert> i doubt i need it in this project. i would just implement quickly one of those slideshow responsive plugin and stop
[12:10:39] <obert> it is job, not a personal project. i just need to do the things fast and that they're working
[12:10:55] <obert> a very bad job too
[12:11:01] <Cork> ya, can't help you
[12:11:07] <obert> bah
[12:11:11] <obert> thanks the same
[12:11:15] <Cork> i stay away from then so can't recommend any
[12:11:19] <obert> i will idle in chan if someone is awake
[12:11:20] <Cork> *them
[12:11:50] <Cork> obert: best options is prob to just plow through the plugins and test them
[12:12:06] <obert> you can gimme your css3 thingy just out of curiosity
[12:12:26] <obert> Cork: yeah, but it require times. irc should be helpfull in that way
[12:12:48] <Cork> obert: one example of it http://www.creativejuiz.fr/trytotry/juizy-slideshow-full-css3-html5/
[12:13:05] <Cork> i hand write it for the project i need, so i don't have anything to link
[12:13:09] <obert> cool
[12:14:13] <Cork> hmm heh that link looks quite good actually :)
[12:14:38] <obert> browser support?
[12:14:51] <obert> firefox 4?:p
[12:15:00] <Cork> css3 so firefox, chrome, opera
[12:15:08] <Cork> ie is prob ie9 or 10
[12:15:16] <BillCriswell> obert: The browser requirements are right there
[12:15:17] <Cork> might even be 11
[12:15:30] <obert> BillCriswell: help me :P
[12:15:33] <Cork> heh
[12:15:42] <Cork> obert: you want a screenshot? :D
[12:16:07] <obert> if you only see the current design i had to redo, you wouldnt let me spend all this time around perfection
[12:16:37] <obert> Cork: if you want
[12:16:53] <obert> i hate some site design. deeply
[12:17:22] <Cork> ya, legacy sucks
[12:17:50] <Cork> especially if the one holding hte project before didn't care about code managing
[12:18:21] <Cork> spaghetti code ftw!
[12:18:36] <obert> 'it is too much minimalist and clear, people don't like it. people want Crazyness, things that are running in the screen, info hard to be found, that's the modern design'
[12:18:58] <Cork> ya
[12:19:13] <Cork> light gray text on white background
[12:19:14] <obert> 'use a big amount of position: absolute, so make it responsive will be a nightmare for you'
[12:19:33] <obert> 'didn't finish it yet?!! you suck!'
[12:19:54] <obert> what a life
[12:20:11] <Cork> "they did it so it must be simple"
[12:20:16] <Cork> ever heard that one?
[12:20:30] <obert> probably
[12:20:36] <obert> i am just tired on the 90s
[12:20:58] <Cork> that one isn't from the 90's though
[12:21:04] <obert> sorry for the words people
[12:21:29] <obert> the design i were working on is from 90s.
[12:21:47] <Cork> obert: so tables and spacer images? :D
[12:21:47] <obert> 'i like it! make it responsive for me!'
[12:21:55] <Cork> cause that is basically what existed in the 90's
[12:21:59] <obert> just an image with text inside it
[12:22:11] <obert> a big image with text, curves, such.
[12:22:16] <Cork> (i actually coded pages in the mid 90's)
[12:22:37] <obert> it is like make a raster web page and publish it
[12:22:49] <obert> :(
[12:23:12] <Cork> one milion pixels?
[12:23:15] <Cork> :D
[12:23:24] <Cork> ?g one million pixels
[12:23:24] <obert> sigh
[12:23:25] <b-ot> Cork: The Million Dollar Homepage - Own a piece of internet history! â http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/
[12:23:39] <obert> dunno
[12:23:55] <Cork> that page actually existed in the 90's ^
[12:23:59] <obert> yeah
[12:24:11] <obert> my design costs $80 though
[12:24:18] <obert> not $1b
[12:24:41] <obert> tsk better find something to eat if i get it
[12:42:33] <BillCriswell> Not sure how a designer can't tell if something is going to look gross or not before I code it out.
[12:47:27] <gingitsune> Can some please help me figure out how to target an element that is appended by another script.
[12:48:18] <gingitsune> I'm trying to apply a monkie patch to openERP
[12:48:51] <__joshua__> script from same domain?
[12:48:57] <gingitsune> .load() doesn't work as i'm waiting on a <tr>
[12:49:23] <gingitsune> Yes, the engine gathers all the js and mushes it up into one.
[12:59:49] <phelix> Say I want to get all the classess of an element by knowing a single class on page load. would I do this inside like document.ready ??
[13:00:07] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:00:15] <duch_kazatel> you should be doing most of your stuff in a doc ready.
[13:00:23] <phelix> it is in doc ready.
[13:00:42] <phelix> but.. without doing something say like on change or on hover or something. I just want it to do it when the page loads
[13:01:11] <duch_kazatel> as long as your script fires after the document is ready, sure.
[13:01:19] <phelix> how do I get info about a class? like I can do it on change with something like $('.slider-container .Conceptual-Thinking').on('change', function() {
[13:01:38] <phelix> but not sure if I just want to get this info when the page loads how do I go about it that way?
[13:01:44] <phelix> i don't want to get it on a specific event.
[13:01:44] <duch_kazatel> $('.class') <- there it is.
[13:02:06] <duch_kazatel> right - if it's inside document ready, you're in an event.
[13:02:10] * __joshua__ $('.myclass').attr('class');
[13:02:11] <phelix> well if I try like $('#someid') for example I get an error about the # sign
[13:02:19] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:02:20] <phelix> hmm
[13:02:36] <phelix> nvm, let me just try that. This is what I thought but was getting an error. Let me try again
[13:02:56] <duch_kazatel> the element needs to exist and jquery needs to be on the page.
[13:03:01] <duch_kazatel> that's about all you need.
[13:03:42] <white_magic> anyone know why something like "for (var v in ['alpha', 'beta', 'charlie']) { alert(v); }" displays 0, 1, & 2 instead of the text entries?
[13:04:04] <duch_kazatel> because you're displaying the property names, not their contents.
[13:04:06] <paulvd> when i click on 2nd level menu item, it closes ?
[13:04:08] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/3y8m9/
[13:04:47] <white_magic> i also tried "for (var v in ['alpha', 'beta', 'charlie']) { alert($(this)); }"
[13:04:56] <white_magic> also tried "for (var v in ['alpha', 'beta', 'charlie']) { alert($(this).text); }"
[13:05:06] <duch_kazatel> do you want the text?
[13:05:15] <white_magic> yea
[13:05:19] <phelix> can I make a function with that? like $('.slider-container .noUi-target') { myclass = $(this).attr('class'); } ?
[13:05:44] <duch_kazatel> y

[13:05:48] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/c52um/
[13:06:03] <duch_kazatel> white_magic but traditionally you want to use an iterator instead of a for...in...
[13:06:07] <duch_kazatel> phelix huh?
[13:06:22] <duch_kazatel> phelix you'd do  $('.slider-container .noUi-target').attr('class');
[13:06:31] <phelix> ahh ok
[13:06:34] <white_magic> duch_kazatel: i get your code example - i just wanted to see if i can have an anonymous array in that loop
[13:06:38] <phelix> im used to doing everything inside a function
[13:06:41] <duch_kazatel> var myClass = $('.slider-container .noUi-target').attr('class');
[13:07:13] <white_magic> is that not possible? i'm thinking in a more Pythonic way probably
[13:07:25] <duch_kazatel> white_magic without some kind of reference back to the array, no.
[13:07:31] <white_magic> rats!
[13:07:40] <duch_kazatel> what's the use case you're working on?
[13:08:05] <white_magic> just something to save me time while doing validation
[13:09:01] <duch_kazatel> you could do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/c52um/1/
[13:11:22] <duch_kazatel> white_magic but if you're dealing with a pure array, you should use an iterator instead.
[13:12:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/c52um/2/
[13:24:39] <mehrdad_> so how do i get nivo to transition images smoothly and not zoom in on the images?
[13:24:55] <mehrdad_> the dimensions are all correct in the css too
[13:25:49] <mehrdad_> take a look www.nard.biz
[13:29:07] <duch_kazatel> where's the documentation for it?
[13:29:30] <phelix> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/ELPxC/2/
[13:30:00] <duch_kazatel> what about it?
[13:30:05] <phelix> do you know why when I run this the variable specificclass gets assigned by thte first item. But it never updates and changes to the next?
[13:30:33] <duch_kazatel> where's the variable defined?
[13:30:35] <phelix> why is it not grabbing the next item and then the next etc?
[13:30:41] <phelix> specificclass = classes[4];
[13:31:00] <duch_kazatel> your fiddle doesn not have that in it
[13:31:07] <phelix> yah it does
[13:31:14] <phelix> line 9 on the jquery part
[13:31:27] <duch_kazatel> there is nothing after line 8 for me.

[13:31:39] <phelix> try that
[13:31:49] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[13:32:40] <phelix> do I have to put it inside something like. $('.slider-container .noUi-target').each(function(idx, elm) {
[13:32:40] <duch_kazatel> you're setting specificclass to the exact same value however many times that loop runs.
[13:32:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:32:48] <duch_kazatel> brb
[13:32:50] <duch_kazatel> i'll show you.
[13:32:54] <phelix> but as its running that class changes
[13:33:04] <phelix> why does it take the properties from the first run through but not on the next etc.
[13:33:07] <duch_kazatel> but specificclass = classes[4]; does the exact same inside and outside of that loop.
[13:33:17] <duch_kazatel> anyway, brb
[13:33:38] <phelix> but as it goes through the html specificclass should be grabbing the classes of the other items etc.
[13:33:40] <phelix> k
[13:40:17] <duch_kazatel> back.
[13:40:23] <phelix> k
[13:40:35] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're very confused about what this code does - step through it.
[13:41:11] <phelix> Well it works perfectly when its inside $('.slider-container .noUi-target').on('change', function() {
[13:41:22] <phelix> why does it not work when not inside this function?
[13:41:38] <duch_kazatel> this exact same code?  or a version that uses $(this) instead?
[13:41:48] <phelix> yah there is a this on it
[13:41:56] <phelix> I think I need to figure out how to add a this to that piece of code somehow
[13:41:57] <duch_kazatel> instead of $('.slider-container .noUi-target') ?
[13:42:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah, what you really want is $('.slider-container .noUi-target').each(function(){}); probably.
[13:42:30] <phelix> ahh ok
[13:42:32] <phelix> that makes more sense
[13:43:22] <duch_kazatel> also: jsfiddle.net/ELPxC/3/
[13:43:25] <duch_kazatel> lines 4 and 5.
[13:43:34] <duch_kazatel> and you're missing a declaration for specificclass.
[13:43:51] <phelix> yah I think I can get it to work now that I have it in a function
[13:43:52] <duch_kazatel> also: use camelcase to make things a little more readable - specificClass
[13:43:53] <phelix> let me play with it for a second
[13:44:04] <phelix> k
[13:47:17] <Horacsio> I have a checkbox and I want that checkbox to fadein a div. and if the user checkbox again fadeout.
[13:47:31] <duch_kazatel> Horacsio what do you have so far?
[13:48:14] <Horacsio> just the checkbox class:cmpif-present
[13:48:35] <Horacsio> if you could point me an example where this happens...
[13:48:43] <duch_kazatel> so you haven't actually tried anything yet?  take a look at .on() and the change event.
[13:48:59] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:49:10] <duch_kazatel> and then animations.
[13:50:01] <Horacsio> yeah ;) I think this is ti :)
[13:52:09] <WigglesMcMuffin> Is anyone here familiar with ajax, that could give me a hand? I am making a cross domain ajax call, and I've set the access-control-allow-origin, the access-control-expose-headers, and access-control-allow-headers, yet the ajax call vehemently denies that they exist. Any suggestions?
[13:52:28] <duch_kazatel> WigglesMcMuffin you've got them set where?  on the server?
[13:53:08] <fusionjunky> does the request return those headers?
[13:54:05] <WigglesMcMuffin> duch_katatel: They're written by the script that responds to the call. Is it an apache response as well that is required?
[13:54:20] <duch_kazatel> WigglesMcMuffin it's only in the response those are required.
[13:54:24] <duch_kazatel> the server has to allow cross-domain.
[13:54:43] <phelix> WigglesMcMuffin lol, love the name hah.
[13:55:07] <WigglesMcMuffin> duch_kazatel: What exactly does that mean? Is that a config setting? I'm just stumped on what I'm missing
[13:55:15] <WigglesMcMuffin> phelix: Thanks!
[13:55:30] <duch_kazatel> WigglesMcMuffin it means that you need to config apache's reponse headers.
[13:55:41] <duch_kazatel> i'm not familiar with how apache handles it thougj.
[13:55:43] <duch_kazatel> *though
[13:55:53] <WigglesMcMuffin> duch_kazatel: Great! That at least points me in the correct direction

[13:57:15] <gordian> if i use $.html() to add an image directly into a DIV is there a way to make sure that my next function only runs after that image is loaded?
[13:57:53] <duch_kazatel> gordian look at the load event.
[14:03:49] <fiveofoh> phelix: Copy/pasting code around isn't gonna end well if you don't know what it does
[14:03:56] <duch_kazatel> word.
[14:04:27] <gordian> duch_kazatel: so instead of using $.html() i should use $.load() eh?
[14:04:32] <duch_kazatel> gordian no.
[14:04:38] <duch_kazatel> the load event.  not method.
[14:04:59] <duch_kazatel> $('div').on('load', 'img', function(){});
[14:05:05] <duch_kazatel> where div is your parent container.
[14:05:08] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[14:05:10] <gordian> gotcha
[14:05:16] <gordian> thanks
[14:05:19] <gordian> i'll give it a try
[14:08:27] <v0id3d> By the way guys thanks for the links I got exactly what i was looking for life savers
[14:08:36] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d sure.
[14:08:52] <duch_kazatel> that's what we're here for.  the goal is to never see you ask another question :)
[14:09:02] <v0id3d> hahaha
[14:09:56] <v0id3d> fair enough i read that i was asking my question far to wrong i needed to ask about jquery and ajax
[14:10:20] <duch_kazatel> what's up?
[14:10:36] <v0id3d> no i got it now
[14:10:47] <v0id3d> i am trying to pull from a DB to populate a combo box
[14:10:52] <duch_kazatel> ah
[14:11:12] <v0id3d> I already made the php but had no clue how to tie it in
[14:11:21] <v0id3d> .ajax for the win
[14:11:26] <duch_kazatel> surprisingly easy, isn't it?
[14:11:31] <v0id3d> yes
[14:11:47] <fiveofoh> phelix: First of all, include jQuery (and jQuery UI) in your fiddle, otherwise none of the jQuery will work.  Second: jsFiddle by default puts your JS code inside the $(document).ready(function(){}), which is the function you're used to doing things in (and is generally good)
[14:11:49] <v0id3d> now trying to figure out how to make it a function and pull it out of html
[14:11:58] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh it was just a code example.
[14:12:26] <fiveofoh> duch_kazatel: Mkay, I was skimming scrollback.
[14:12:41] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh they were just using it to share a piece of code, not to get it to function in this case :)
[14:13:08] <v0id3d> any good js websites so i can read up on it instead of the w3schools?
[14:13:09] <fiveofoh> Heh, overkill, but fine :P
[14:13:16] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d mdn
[14:13:23] <fiveofoh> Yep, MDN is my go-to reference
[14:13:30] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d learning to use MDN is a fantastic thing
[14:13:53] <fiveofoh> And has some good tutorials and narrative content on other stuff too (e.g. Canvas)
[14:14:24] <v0id3d> thank you thank you
[14:14:41] <v0id3d> hopefully soon I can help others as well haha
[14:14:51] <duch_kazatel> for jquery, the api docs are stellar, as well.
[14:15:15] <fiveofoh> v0id3d: That's how many of us are here :) And yes, for specific libs (jQuery, etc), check their site's docs
[14:15:38] <fiveofoh> Also, note that jQuery UI is a separate project, so for widgets, etc, use the jquery UI site
[14:15:52] <v0id3d> i have not even touched jquery ui
[14:15:54] <fiveofoh> Sometimes I get confused when there are no search results for dialog() at the jquery docs :P
[14:15:55] <v0id3d> i am not that far yet
[14:16:02] <duch_kazatel> i pdersonally don't use jqueryui personally.
[14:16:07] <duch_kazatel> wow whuddup repetition.
[14:16:42] <fiveofoh> Heh
[14:18:25] <v0id3d> Thank God i didnt drop program logic and design
[14:21:43] <clime> how can I force google chrome to repaint canvas? My changes to dom are not being displayed (until I e.g. open developer tools). I have tried $('<style></style>').appendTo($(document.body)).remove(); but that doesn't work reliably
[14:30:36] <v0id3d> is it ok to post one line of code just so i can make sure that i am on the right path
[14:31:25] <clime> I have tried putting emptyStyle.remove() into setTimeout with 10ms. Hopefully it will work now. (It works on my comp always but not on computers of some other ppl. Looks like it depends on performance - if removing is too fast, no repainting again)
[14:36:49] <duch_kazatel> v0id3d one-liners can be okay, sure.
[14:37:00] <v0id3d> i actually just ran it so it worked
[14:37:50] <v0id3d> i just had a few mistakes but now i know i can run $(document).read(myFunction());
[14:37:58] <v0id3d> is there any good rule of thumb with that
[14:37:59] <duch_kazatel> .read()?
[14:38:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: No unread messages.
[14:38:10] <duch_kazatel> oh ready
[14:38:20] <v0id3d> .ready
[14:38:20] <b-ot> v0id3d: called as soon as the DOM tree is parsed.
[14:38:21] <v0id3d> \lol
[14:38:37] <v0id3d> yes i just wondering if a rule of thumb with not using it in certain points
[14:38:39] <v0id3d> using it at others
[14:38:50] <duch_kazatel> use it whenever your script relies on DOM content.
[14:39:17] <duch_kazatel> basically, if you're accessing the DOM, you need it.  and use the shorthand syntax instead.
[14:39:25] <duch_kazatel> $(function(){ /* your code here */ });
[14:40:21] <v0id3d> yea i am really liking jquery hahah
[14:40:26] <v0id3d> makes life real simple
[14:41:38] <v0id3d> $("h1").click(myFunction()); will run my function anytime someone clicks an h1 rite
[14:42:03] <shoky> nope
[14:42:06] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:42:13] <v0id3d> ok
[14:42:21] <duch_kazatel> $('h1').on('click', myFunction);
[14:42:26] <v0id3d> gotcha
[14:42:40] <duch_kazatel> or $('h1').on('click', function(){ /* your code here */ });
[14:42:53] <duch_kazatel> I'd suggest .on() instead of the convenience methods.
[14:42:59] <duch_kazatel> but that's personal taste.
[14:43:16] <shoky> $("h1").click(myFunction());   is the same as:   var returnvalue = myFunction();  $("h1").click( returnvalue );
[14:43:18] <v0id3d> i see a lot of the function(){ } is that a good practice?
[14:43:27] <v0id3d> ok got you
[14:44:13] <duch_kazatel> function(){} is how you run an anonymous function within your callback - if you don't want to define it beforehand.
[14:44:33] <v0id3d> I am trying to define as much as i can for the practice
[14:44:41] <duch_kazatel> that's smart.
[14:45:39] <v0id3d> much easier to debug
[14:45:45] <duch_kazatel> depending.
[14:45:58] <v0id3d> i am not in complicated code as of yet
[14:46:51] <v0id3d> $('h1').on('click', fillComboFromDB()); seems like it is doing the same as the .click
[14:46:57] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[14:47:03] <duch_kazatel> .click() is actially .on('click'
[14:47:07] <v0id3d> ok
[14:47:11] <v0id3d> like an alias
[14:47:13] <duch_kazatel> just a convenience method.
[14:47:17] <v0id3d> got you
[14:47:49] <v0id3d> so how would i make it work only when item is clicked?
[14:47:57] <duch_kazatel> "item" being...?
[14:48:00] <v0id3d> h1
[14:48:17] <duch_kazatel> that's what your code is doing.
[14:48:22] <v0id3d> its not tho
[14:48:25] <duch_kazatel> click on the h1, stuff happens.
[14:48:37] <duch_kazatel> mind sharing your code in a fiddle, then?
[14:48:48] <v0id3d> sure
[14:50:21] <v0id3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Sddu3/
[14:50:44] <duch_kazatel> what about the HTML?
[14:50:44] <rOOb> Hello all. I'm trying to send a form via ajax but for some reason its only sending the last part http://pastebin.com/SrurCNr1
[14:50:59] <v0id3d> it loads before i click
[14:51:16] <duch_kazatel> i mean i need to see the html.
[14:52:17] <v0id3d> I think ill send it when i get to the house i am currently about to leave the job
[14:52:24] <shoky> v0id3d: stop passing the return value of the callback instead of the callback itself.  $('h1').on('click', fillComboFromDB());    is wrong.   fillComboFromDB() calls it right away
[14:52:59] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah, v0id3d it's $('h1').on('click', fillComboFromDB);
[14:53:07] <v0id3d> oh haha
[14:53:09] <duch_kazatel> drop the parens.
[14:53:10] <v0id3d> gotcha -=)
[14:53:18] <duch_kazatel> was having a hard time understanding your problem.
[14:53:35] <v0id3d> I could tell you the problem if it was cpp hahah
[14:53:49] <v0id3d> but then i prolly wouldnt even run into that
[14:53:51] <v0id3d> but thanks guys
[14:53:52] <v0id3d> again
[14:53:55] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[14:54:53] <v0id3d> ill be back on later
[14:54:56] <v0id3d> take it easy guys
[14:55:00] <duch_kazatel> all right.  enjoy.
[14:55:38] <shoky> rOOb: your other inputs don't have a "name" attribute
[14:56:03] <shoky> rOOb: form inputs are only sent/serialized if they have names
[14:56:03] <rOOb> omg
[14:57:51] <rOOb> shoky, Wow. I feel dumb. Thanks alot... I've been tinkering with this for a while
[15:09:10] <duch_kazatel> i do juuuust enough work with URLs at this point that i'm just going to write my own parsing lib.
[15:12:06] <fons1> Hello. I'm having an issue with a validation script for my contact form I am running. I have two valdiation scripts running, one client side and one server side. Both validation scripts run on submit. If an error is found and I make my correction and hit submit again, my server side script runs twice and two emails are sent out. It seems the submit isn't cleared for some reason. Link to the
[15:12:06] <fons1> server side validation script: http://jsfiddle.net/chPY7/.
[15:13:54] <fons1> My client side validation script and form: http://jsfiddle.net/E9nF4/
[15:14:48] <fons1> Any idea on how to clear/reset on every submit so it doesn't send twice?
[15:15:26] <duch_kazatel> looks like you're binding on click.
[15:15:51] <fons1> Yes.
[15:16:43] <duch_kazatel> don't bind on events, bind to them.  that make sense?'
[15:16:46] <T13|sleeps> I have been trying to understand synchronous v. asynchronous for three months now.  .promise() callbacks...  I can't seem to get it.  Can anyone point me to a real good tutorial to teach me what I seem to ne missing.
[15:16:48] <fons1> wait. I thought it was binding on submit.
[15:16:54] <duch_kazatel> or submit.
[15:16:56] <duch_kazatel> either way.
[15:17:05] <duch_kazatel> T13|sleeps what aren't you understanding?
[15:17:21] <fons1> where do you see it binding on click?
[15:17:33] <duch_kazatel> fons1 i'm seeing it on submit - that was before i read the fiddle ;)
[15:18:15] <T13|sleeps> I have some ajax queries, and I can't seem to get them to work in a linear fashion.
[15:18:37] <duch_kazatel> T13|sleeps you would need to chain them via callbacks.
[15:19:28] <T13|sleeps> Yes... I have managed to get a single callback to work, but I have multiple requests.
[15:19:42] <fons1> @duch - Here is the form in action: http://a2ads.com/test/. See advertisers section.
[15:19:45] <duch_kazatel> T13|sleeps right - you have you put each one in the callback of the one that come before it.
[15:20:34] <T13|sleeps> Yeah, I understand what I have to do, but not so much how to do it.
[15:20:42] <duch_kazatel> have a same.,
[15:20:43] <fons1> Hit submit, shows you the errors. correct errors and submit and my server side validation sends an email out twice.
[15:20:47] <duch_kazatel> *sample, T13|sleeps?
[15:21:10] <T13|sleeps> I know it is a foundational lack of understanding of how callbacks work.
[15:21:10] <duch_kazatel> fons1 make sure you're binding all your stuff to the event and not binding it within the event.
[15:21:34] <fons1> Not exactly sure what you mean.
[15:22:31] <T13|sleeps> https://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/ACCHelp.js
[15:22:33] <fons1> nm. reading about bind
[15:22:36] <T13|sleeps> Foo.
[15:22:37] <fons1> I'll give it a shot
[15:22:40] <duch_kazatel> actually, read about .on()
[15:22:46] <T13|sleeps> That link won't work..
[15:22:49] <duch_kazatel> but make sure your event bindings aren't munged.
[15:22:53] <T13|sleeps> http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/SandBox/ACCHelp.js
[15:22:57] <T13|sleeps> Will..
[15:22:57] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:24:45] <T13|sleeps> http://enwp.org/User:Technical_13/Scripts/ACCHelp/CentralAuth.js calls userLinks (hundreds of times)
[15:27:43] <fons1> @duch - Switched "$('#advertiserform').submit(function(){" to "$( "#advertiserform" ).on( "submit", function( event ) {". Still no go. Form submits twice
[15:29:36] <duch_kazatel> back
[15:29:53] <duch_kazatel> fons1 mind linking the updated code?
[15:30:06] <duch_kazatel> fons1 i think you're confused about what i'm saying.  let me try to cook up an example.
[15:30:34] <fons1> Sure. Let me get it up on JFiddle. Give me a second.
[15:32:49] <motaka2> if I use data to add some sata to a jquery DOM , how can I get that data somewhere elese out of that file?
[15:33:46] <duch_kazatel> fons1 http://jsfiddle.net/7f5zk/
[15:33:55] <duch_kazatel> to a "jquery DOM"
[15:34:00] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 clarify your question.
[15:34:28] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I dont know how to do that
[15:34:31] <fons1> duch - Here's the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5Uh2X/
[15:34:55] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 jquery DOM isn't a thing.  what are you trying to do?
[15:35:13] <duch_kazatel> fons1 where are you binding the event that runs the validator?
[15:36:08] <fons1> whoops. let me fix it
[15:36:11] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[15:36:16] <duch_kazatel> thanks don :)
[15:37:01] <motaka2> look i have several tables in  a view. and I can add or delete rows to them. I keep the number of row in $table.data("nrows"); I have written all this code in a plugin. now somewhere out of that plugin I need to know $("#tableX") has how many rows
[15:37:02] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7f5zk/1/ my example, now with comments.
[15:37:38] <duch_kazatel> $('#tableX').data("nrows") will get the value for you, motaka2
[15:37:56] <fons1> duch - http://jsfiddle.net/5Uh2X/1/
[15:37:58] <motaka2> no it doesnt. it return NaN
[15:38:32] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 then you're incporrectly writing to it.
[15:38:44] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: maybe I should add that data using data-nrows attr
[15:38:53] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 no.
[15:38:57] <fons1> Thanks for the help duch. Appreciate it. You helped me out with an issue a week ago as well.
[15:38:59] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you'll have the exact same issue.
[15:39:12] <motaka2> lemme upload
[15:40:46] <fons1> I'm aware that both validation scripts run on submit (client and server)...
[15:41:01] <duch_kazatel> right, and then it runs twice on second submit
[15:41:06] <duch_kazatel> then three times on third, I'll bet.
[15:41:11] <fons1> Yes.
[15:41:17] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: http://fa.noondreams.com/hotels/form/departments/web_department/
[15:41:30] <duch_kazatel> which means that you're bidning to an event within another event binding
[15:41:46] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 link to the JS file instead, please.
[15:42:11] <motaka2> I want to know the number  of added rows when I click on "Ø«Ø¨Øª"
[15:42:45] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you said you're storing info using .data(), right?
[15:43:04] <duch_kazatel> because if accessing using .data returns NaN, that means you're storing the value wrong.
[15:43:06] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: thanks for your care. I hope we can discuss it another time. It's time to go to bed. thx
[15:43:12] <duch_kazatel> welp.
[15:43:36] <fons1> Lost me. So when I hit submit they're both binding to the "on submit"?
[15:43:49] <duch_kazatel> fons1 nonono.
[15:44:02] <duch_kazatel> you've bound to the submit event - that.s the .submit() portion.
[15:44:02] <fons1> How do I get the server side script (advertiser-validation) to reset after each submit?
[15:44:13] <crazyjawa> http://jsfiddle.net/E6MDe/ , can anyone help me with doing an onclick event that will hide/show slide the following menu items with some sort of loop for each section? Currently, the code will hide/show all of the sections. Each section is unique though and I have a large number of them and would like for jquery to just hide/show the section that is clicked on
[15:44:44] <duch_kazatel> fons1 so that first part is right.
[15:44:47] <crazyjawa> i know i could do this if i added a class and did an onclick event for each and every one but was hoping there was a clever function that could be written for this purpose to consolidate code
[15:45:04] <fons1> Okay. I get that. How would you approach the fix since I want to run both scripts on submit.
[15:45:37] <fons1> ....and get the submit to reset I guess.
[15:45:40] <duch_kazatel> fons1 the issue is that within your submit handler, you're likely binding a second handler.
[15:46:50] <fons1> How do I not bind to a second handler?
[15:46:58] <fons1> or clear it each time...
[15:47:04] <duch_kazatel> fons1 stop thinking of "clearing" it.
[15:47:11] <duch_kazatel> that's the sort of thing you don't want to do.
[15:47:33] <duch_kazatel> fons1 let me read through your handler again.
[15:47:48] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa can you structure your code so the menu items are nested together?
[15:48:05] <fons1> Cool thanks. http://jsfiddle.net/7f5zk/1/
[15:48:23] <fons1> wait.
[15:48:24] <duch_kazatel> fons1 do you see that i'm illustrating there?
[15:48:26] <fons1> that was your example
[15:48:27] <fons1> http://jsfiddle.net/5Uh2X/1/
[15:48:33] <duch_kazatel> i all ready have your example :)
[15:49:01] <fons1> So both scripts are running in the same function is what you're saying?
[15:49:10] <fons1> the function of on submit?
[15:49:14] <duch_kazatel> no.  something is binding twice.
[15:49:23] <duch_kazatel> something is binding once for every time submit is rtun.
[15:49:25] <duch_kazatel> *run
[15:49:47] <fons1> Okay. How do I..not clear the bind...but fix it.
[15:49:48] <fons1> haha
[15:50:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm trying to find whjere the second binding is getting added.
[15:50:06] <duch_kazatel> *where
[15:50:16] <crazyjawa> duch_kazatel do you mean nest them under each section?
[15:51:02] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa sure, or somehow logically tie them together through data attributes or a class or something?  because otherwise it's very difficult to write something sensible.
[15:51:28] <fons1> @duch. This is the bootstrap validator I am using: https://github.com/nghuuphuoc/bootstrapvalidator. They have a custom submit handler which I've played with but still have the same issue.
[15:51:36] <fons1> or I'm doing it wrong.
[15:51:58] <crazyjawa> duch_kazatel gotcha. yes i'm working on that now...makes sense. still going to require repeating an onclick event for each section though, right?
[15:52:10] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa not at all.
[15:52:23] <duch_kazatel> fons1 wait the validator has its own submit handler?
[15:52:28] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[15:52:38] <fons1> no. It has the ability to have one
[15:52:47] <fons1> is what I'm saying
[15:52:52] <duch_kazatel> okay\
[15:52:57] <crazyjawa> duch_kazatel what would a function look like for that? trying to wrap my head around it
[15:53:16] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa close to what you have there, but you'd use $(this) to know which title was clicked and go from there.
[15:54:08] <duch_kazatel> fons1 submitHandler - you need to use this feature.
[15:54:21] <duch_kazatel> instead of binding to the submit event.
[15:54:40] <duch_kazatel> define the function and then pass its name to that option.
[15:54:58] <crazyjawa> hmm but the problem is the click event is on the title and i want the title div always visible because thats whats clickable. so i select the title div and click that then it hides/shows the section attached to it. so $(this) would apply to what was clicked and would hide the entire thing
[15:55:08] <fons1> ..and that's for the client side validation which I bind it to correct...the bootstrap validator?
[15:55:11] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa (sigh) one sec.
[15:55:40] <duch_kazatel> fons1 the bootstrap one is likely the one with the issue.
[15:55:48] <duch_kazatel> are you using node or something, fons1?
[15:56:06] <duch_kazatel> you keep saying "client side" vs "server side" and then linking to two basic javascript files.
[15:57:06] <fons1> On submit the form runs through a PHP file and spits it back a validation error message to the site.
[15:57:36] <fons1> Let me show you that. It might be the issue as well.
[15:57:49] <duch_kazatel> fons1 i know nothing about php.
[15:58:29] <duch_kazatel> crazyjawa http://jsfiddle.net/E6MDe/1/
[15:58:34] <fons1> Okay. Let me play around with the submit handler.
[15:58:36] <fons1> thanks
[15:58:41] <duch_kazatel> this is why i asked you to nest your stuff together logically.
[15:58:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/E6MDe/2/ - better formatted.
[15:59:27] <duch_kazatel> fons1 sorry man, but i'm not able to dump super deep into your stuff.  i'd start console logging stuff and seeing what's getting called where and explain to myself exactly what's happening like i'm 5.
[15:59:30] <duch_kazatel> I actually do that.
[15:59:54] <crazyjawa> duch_kazatel awesome! makes sense
[15:59:58] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel, +1 for super dumbed down self-explanation, it works
[16:00:03] <crazyjawa> duch_kazatel thanks very much
[16:01:06] <duch_kazatel> Jattenalle i have a little r2-d2 figure at my desk below my monitor that i explain things to when i'm having a hard time understanding something.
[16:01:15] <Jattenalle> haha, nice :D
[16:02:17] <Guest-Pirc> Can anybody help me understand the difference between jQuery and jQuery Mobile?
[16:02:27] <Guest-Pirc> /user iaef
[16:03:20] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a general library for general dom abstraction and other convenience methods.  jquery mobile adds stuff for mobile-specific stuff.
[16:05:14] <duch_kazatel> Guest-Pirc that answer your question?
[16:05:50] <decx> i don't like jqm, it's so overbearing
[16:05:56] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[16:06:33] <duch_kazatel> kinda like jqueryui
[16:07:10] <decx> yeah, they are good bases for general purpose. but like all mass produced things lack flexibility
[16:07:29] <duch_kazatel> yeah as long as you stay in the designated fun zone, you're fine.
[16:07:31] <duch_kazatel> like bootstrap.
[16:09:34] <duch_kazatel> or disneyland.
[16:09:36] <duch_kazatel> :D
[16:11:02] <decx> behind the set of cinderellas castle is a vietnamese sweatshop
[16:11:18] <duch_kazatel> that got dark.
[16:11:26] <duch_kazatel> i've been behind set before.
[16:18:23] <gthoma2> Well my employer has a problem with the speed at which a certain page loads via $.mobile.navigate("#pageID2")
[16:18:32] <gthoma2> I am developing a PhoneGap application which should take the user to one of two beginning pages, the first page should pop up if they are opening the applicaiton as normal
[16:18:49] <gthoma2> Either from resuming from background or opening app from the tray
[16:18:55] <gthoma2> and the second page should load instead of the first if the user clicks on a notification which is fired from the applicaiton
[16:19:01] <gthoma2> The problem is that opening the second page, right now, first opens the first page briefly and then opens the second page... in that time to switch to the second page, a user will be able to log in to the app via the first page
[16:19:08] <gthoma2> I need a quicker way of navigating to the second page upon a user tapping a notification, so that they won't see the first page load at all.
[16:19:27] <duch_kazatel> that's because jquery mobile needs that first page to initializew.
[16:19:31] <duch_kazatel> *initialize.
[16:19:50] <duch_kazatel> you might need to do some sort of hiding/loading thing.,
[16:19:53] <gthoma2> Here is the onclick() event listener from a localNotification plugin that I am using to navigate to the second page...
[16:19:59] <gthoma2>  window.plugin.notification.local.onclick = function(id, state, json){                  $.mobile.navigate('#delay'); ... }
[16:20:11] <gthoma2> How would I do that?
[16:20:51] <duch_kazatel> create a div that takes up the whole viewport and put in an ajax spinner or something and then have that display over the whole page.
[16:20:58] <duch_kazatel> then when the page is done doing its thing, hide it.
[16:23:17] <gthoma2> Okay...
[16:24:34] <uGoMobi> gthoma2: is using a multi-page template for those two start pages an option?
[16:25:29] <gthoma2> I don't have a strong Web dev background but I think what I am hearing is that the initial page in the body of my html should just be a fullscreen ajax spinner, and then navigate to either #PageID1 or #PageID2 depending on whether the user opens the app via notification or otherwise?
[16:25:42] <duch_kazatel> not the initial page, just a div.
[16:26:01] <uGoMobi> right
[16:26:02] <gthoma2> I have made a stackOverflow thread of my problem, where I explain things in depth
[16:26:06] <gthoma2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22338631/need-a-faster-method-of-dynamically-loading-start-pages-with-jquery-mobile
[16:29:41] <gthoma2> I don't know what a multi-page template is... but I am open to ideas
[16:29:57] <duch_kazatel> i just gave you one.  but okay.
[16:31:54] <gthoma2> Just read up on multiple page template, yes this is what I amusing
[16:32:03] <uGoMobi> gthoma2: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/pages/
[16:32:40] <gthoma2> as in... multiple <div data-role="page"> content...</div> within the <body> of an html file
[16:33:09] <gthoma2> okay, duch, I'd like to use your solution I just want to make sure I know what you mean exactly
[16:34:00] <duch_kazatel> setup a default, fixed position div with styling that overlays it over the entire viewport.  when the init finishes, hide it.
[16:34:32] <gthoma2> Okay, should this div be a parent of the content div?
[16:34:41] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:34:45] <duch_kazatel> it'd be apart of the "page"
[16:34:47] <duch_kazatel> i guess.
[16:35:06] <duch_kazatel> placement isn't actually important
[16:35:07] <gthoma2> alright I'll try this. thank you
[16:35:16] <duch_kazatel> fixed positioning takes it out of the document flow.
[16:38:18] <gthoma2> So I guess I should actually put this viewport wide <div> ajax spinner </div> within the #pageID1 page-- The page that I don't want to pop up before the second page loads, correct?
[16:38:35] <duch_kazatel> you could technically put it anywhere, but sure.
[16:39:08] <gthoma2> sounds good, I'll try this out. thanks!
[16:46:16] <krambiorix> hi, i have some tables with below each table a button. When clicking on the button i want to add a row in the table on top of the button. How can i get the (closest) table on top of the button?
[16:47:32] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it.
[16:48:29] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix because without any context, it's hard to know what you mean by, say "closest"

[16:54:34] <duch_kazatel> for more specificity: http://jsfiddle.net/W23U8/2/
[16:55:56] <aidan> Can anyone posit why the trigger() is not working here? http://dpaste.com/1721135/
[16:56:22] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, thanks!
[16:56:28] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix of course.
[16:56:38] <aidan> I have a $('.documents-tab').on('shown.bs.tab', function () { console.log ... which is not firing. If I click off the tab and come back to it, the event fires
[16:57:09] <soahccc> just wondering if $("â¦").get(0) is exactly the same as $("â¦")[0]
[16:57:10] <duch_kazatel> aidan sounds like you might be binding within another event.
[16:57:44] <duch_kazatel> soahccc it's similar, but not the same.
[16:58:20] <soahccc> duch_kazatel: do you know what the difference is or where it is explained?
[16:59:05] <duch_kazatel> it's explained in the api docs.  one big difference is that you can use negative indexes in .get(), but not with []
[16:59:18] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/get/
[17:02:56] <aidan>   // First page load make sure hash is triggered
[17:02:57] <aidan>   if (window.location.hash == '#documents') {
[17:02:57] <aidan>     $('.documents-tab').trigger('shown.bs.tab');
[17:03:04] <aidan> That's the workaround :/
[17:03:10] <aidan> I don't understand
[17:03:25] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you're binding within another event.  does that make sense?
[17:07:04] <aidan> duch_kazatel: okay, let me check the order everything is happening in
[17:10:22] <aidan> ah, yes .. something screwy is happening
[17:10:24] <aidan> thanks du	
[17:10:36] <aidan> If I put a   $('.documents-tab').on('shown.bs.tab', function() {
[17:10:36] <aidan>     console.log('shown.bs.tab');
[17:10:54] <aidan> at the very top, the event is triggered properly
[17:11:16] <aidan> I think it's triggered before my bind takes place
[17:11:40] <aidan> Yep, that was it.
[17:11:50] <aidan> It gets kind of screwy with async plugins running all over the place :/
[17:12:26] <duch_kazatel> there you go :)
[18:06:29] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/7082339/ - I have Gmail account FREe and Paid. But i have lot of emails such as 10K to 20K and those email-address is not in my Gmail contacts. As a result via my Smartphone or Tablet i do not get those email contacts.  How can i get the email's in the spreed sheet of Google Excel?
[18:10:28] <fiveofoh> IamTrying: This seems to not use jQuery at all, and seems to use some sort of Google API that isn't specified, so we're unlikely to help much
[18:11:33] <IamTrying> OK - no problem thank you. Seems to be working to Hack all the Emails in Spreedsheet but i wanted to do it with JQuery
[18:12:50] <fiveofoh> jQuery would help you if you were scraping the page, but since you're using APIs, it's not really going to do you much good
[18:13:02] <fiveofoh> And scraping the page is going to be a highly impractical way to do it for that volume of emails
[18:13:38] <fiveofoh> You might have better luck inquiring where the code came from: http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/9813/get-e-mail-addresses-from-gmail-messages-received
[18:20:33] <IamTrying> fiveofoh, OK - the code works just fine. 1) it copy all the emails from Gmail (like all the labels and place them in a Sheet), takes a while still its doing those exports  2) it works , without API it wont work
[18:20:37] <IamTrying> thanks
[18:24:15] <fiveofoh> Yeah, it'll just take a while with that many emails, but trying to do anything with jQuery is going to be very much slower still
[18:26:20] <clime> Hey, I have got this piece of code: https://dpaste.de/DXs9 The problem is that sometimes the overlay is not displayed in chrome. It doesn't throw an error or anything, it just doesn't display. But strangely enough it displays as soon as I open developer tools. It seems that it is some kind of repaint problem. It does happen only chrome, not in other browser. I really don't know how to solve it. I have tried to reproduce it in jsfiddle, bu
[18:27:22] <IamTrying> OK - thank you fiveofoh
[18:27:34] <clime> I have also tried to place     $('<style></style>').appendTo($(document.body)).remove(); to the end of the function. That helped on my computer but not on computer of my friend.
[18:28:00] <clime> (he has also chrome but windows version)
[18:29:18] <clime> Anyone knows how to fix this?
[18:39:05] <fiveofoh> clime: I don't quite understand how the code is called, also your first comment got cut off after "jsfiddle"
[18:39:42] <clime> ...I have tried to reproduce it in jsfiddle, but it is not reproducible there
[18:39:57] <fiveofoh> clime: And are you on what, OS X?
[18:40:16] <fiveofoh> Where does this Overlay object you're extending come from?
[18:42:18] <fiveofoh> clime: There's code involved here that's not in your paste or standard jQuery, which makes it difficult to help debug
[18:42:53] <clime> fivefoh: here is complete example: http://jsfiddle.net/MRuHk/
[18:44:09] <clime> I am on linux, my friend is on windows. We both use google-chrome.
[18:48:17] <fiveofoh> clime: Huh, it works fine (in its own page, not in jsfiddle) on my Linux Chromium.  You see this on two instances of chromium though, eh?
[18:49:24] <fiveofoh> clime: Does this still have the issue? http://cincodenada.com/stuff/jqtest.html

[19:54:49] <elijah_> hello all
[19:55:59] <elijah_> all asleep?
[20:08:07] <v0id3d> quick question when i run $('#test').on('click', myfunction); does it have to be nested in $(document).ready ??
[20:09:53] <jphase> v0id3d: It needs to be in some sort of jQuery wrapper. Most use doc ready yes
[20:10:21] <jphase> $(function() {   // also works like this   });
[20:10:45] <jphase> in most situations (not wordpress ;)
[20:10:51] <b1lly1> no
[20:10:53] <b1lly1> thats not true
[20:11:02] <jphase> well didn't used to anyway
[20:11:04] <b1lly1> it doesn't have to be in $(document).ready()
[20:11:44] <jphase> didn't say it needed to be in doc ready, just that most use that
[20:11:45] <b1lly1> but! it does need to be included AFTER the HTML/DOM elements that its effecting is loaded
[20:12:09] <v0id3d> so this is why people use .ready
[20:12:32] <jphase> it allows you to place your js anywhere on the page (although you should place it before </body> always)
[20:12:33] <b1lly1> e.g.       <div class="foo"></div> <script>$('.foo').click(â¦)</script> is fine
[20:12:50] <b1lly1> but yeah
[20:12:51] <v0id3d> i am writing all code in a .js
[20:13:01] <v0id3d> so i can put it in the head
[20:13:10] <b1lly1> it's not good practice to put it in the head
[20:13:19] <v0id3d> where should it be placed?

[20:13:20] <weNeedHelp> A million thanks for your HELP and Have a Nice Day! :)
[20:13:31] <jphase> v0id3d: before </body> as I mentioned ^
[20:13:33] <b1lly1> before closing </body>
[20:13:47] <b1lly1> scripts are considered "blocking" and so, the rest of your page cant be loaded until the js is loaded (if you put it in the head)
[20:13:51] <v0id3d> ok
[20:14:02] <v0id3d> ahhhh
[20:14:05] <v0id3d> makes sense
[20:14:11] <b1lly1> its better to let the HTML/CSS render and include the JS at the end so that the user can actually see the page faster
[20:15:02] <v0id3d> good to know
[20:15:14] <v0id3d> this whole web programming has a lot more hang ups then simple cpp
[20:15:31] <b1lly1> hang ups?
[20:16:26] <v0id3d> like things to remember
[20:16:31] <v0id3d> the whole inline thing
[20:16:47] <b1lly1> i mean
[20:16:55] <b1lly1> it makes sense, if you think about it right?
[20:17:22] <b1lly1> you cant attach events to elements if they dont exist, and the browser interprets the page from top to bottom
[20:19:08] <v0id3d> no it does make sense i just have not played with liniar coding for a while
[20:19:14] <v0id3d> sorry for the mispelling hahaha
[20:25:33] <v0id3d> ok and in my .js should i have multiple $(document).ready()s or just one?
[20:31:04] <jphase> v0id3d: if you use one, one will suffice
[20:32:11] <v0id3d> i am getting a warning that says it is expecting only 1 argument
[20:32:43] <v0id3d> $(document).ready(
[20:32:43] <v0id3d>     $(fillComboFromDB()),
[20:32:43] <v0id3d>     $('#test').on('change', fillComboFromDB)
[20:32:43] <v0id3d> );
[20:32:56] <v0id3d> it works but that warning
[20:33:03] <v0id3d> is it something to be concerned about?
[20:38:47] <checkit> Can anyone in here help me with a validate issue? I need to only require a field to have a value if it exists in the DOM.. We're creating and destroying objects depending certain selections.
[20:41:39] <jphase> v0id3d: $(document).ready(function(){ $('#test').on('change', fillComboFromDB()); });
[20:43:01] <v0id3d> why  place it in function()??
[20:43:58] <jphase> you are attaching a function to the document ready event. in that function you are doing your bidding
[20:44:07] <v0id3d> got you
[20:45:30] <jphase> checkit: is your validation returning false on an input that you removed, and are you using the jQuery validation plugin or something else?
[20:47:08] <checkit> jphase: jquery validation. And no, I think it's just not validating this field which is only available if a certain option in a different select is selected... 'page[template]' : { depends : $('#new_page_template').length, required : true }
[20:48:53] <jphase> checkit: it sounds like you need to add your rules to the elements you're dynamically creating before you insert them into the DOM
[20:49:15] <checkit> jphase: How?
[20:50:38] <jphase> $('<input>').attr({type: 'text', name: 'myinput'}).rules('add', { // some rules here }).appendTo($('#someplace'));
[20:50:40] <jphase> something like that
[20:50:57] <jphase> the .rules part before you insert/append is the important part of that
[20:54:55] <checkit> Okay. I'll give that a go. thanks bud.
[20:55:03] <jphase> np
[20:59:32] <checkit> jphase: Suppose it's a select field... How does that change the example you gave me?
[21:00:23] <jphase> checkit: it doesn't really, just build the select how you normally would and just be sure to add .rules('add', { required: true })  before you append/insert
[21:00:31] <jphase> (or whatever other rules you want to add)
[21:00:49] <checkit> Oh gotcha... okay
[21:13:41] <jcool> I was working on an image drag and drop. for that I have been using markers. Markers can be rectangle, circle or polygon. Can I got the location of any markers that user place on image automatically?
[21:14:17] <jcool> well I looked some functions like offset and position. except that?
[21:23:58] <elijah_> i'm trying to create an onclick and onblur event for a mobile menu icon
[21:24:12] <elijah_> does anyone have any experience doing this?
[21:24:57] <jphase> elijah_: what's your question?
[21:26:11] <elijah_> i have a div with a class and i'd basically like to listen for if someone clicks on it to remove a class
[21:27:46] <elijah_> is there a particular way to do such a thing in jquery?
[21:28:22] <jphase> elijah_: $('.myclass').click(function(){ $(this).removeClass('theclasstoremove'); });
[21:30:55] <elijah_> thanks jphase. that's what i'm currently trying to work with. i was able to hack together from a stackoverflow page that code.
[21:31:30] <elijah_> but it only seems to work when inside of a $(window).load(function() { $function() { code
[21:31:50] <jphase> ?
[21:32:02] <jphase> elijah_: paste your code on hastebin.com or something
[21:32:09] <jphase> or make a jsfiddle
[21:36:27] <araujo> hello, an easy question, latest jquery version (2.x) should work just fine with latest stable jquery-ui?
[21:37:05] <araujo> just asking since I see that jquery-ui brings its own jquery version in the download
[21:37:57] <elijah_> @jphase http://jsfiddle.net/LrEwT/
[21:38:02] <checkit> jphase: Any additional thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/4hbn9/2/
[21:40:04] <jphase> elijah_: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/LrEwT/1/
[21:40:24] <leotr> hi! I'm using jquery form plugin (http://malsup.com/jquery/form/). Is it possible to access data that was sent in ajax request from success() callback function?
[21:41:28] <elijah_> wow that code is so much more clean
[21:41:30] <elijah_> thanks jphase!
[21:41:36] <jphase> np
[21:41:46] <jphase> checkit: so the problem is that it's submitting when it shouldn't be?
[21:41:55] <elijah_> the other thing i'm trying to figure out is if someone clicks on the main body area i want the menu to slide back
[21:42:29] <elijah_> anywhere inside of the .content-container div
[21:42:37] <elijah_> except the menu icon
[21:42:58] <checkit> jphase: If you run this one (w/ out the append().rule()) the validate works on the first drop down.. With rule("add") it doesn't. http://jsfiddle.net/4hbn9/2/
[21:43:10] <checkit> I put the rule at the end of the append... So the drop down toggle still works.
[21:44:58] <jphase> elijah_: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/LrEwT/4/
[21:45:43] <elijah_> thank you so much jphase!
[21:46:54] <jphase> checkit: the rules need to be added to the element you're appending. right now you're binding rules to a #new_parent_fam before you append the element
[21:47:43] <jphase> you could modify your function below to have something like... return combo.rules('add', { required: true });
[21:48:14] <checkit> jphase: AHHHHH
[21:49:26] <checkit> jphase: Damn, that busted the toggle http://jsfiddle.net/4hbn9/4/
[21:49:33] <jphase> doh
[21:55:03] <checkit> Arrrgg!
[21:55:13] <jphase> odd, it seems to bark as soon as you bind .rules
[21:55:19] <jphase> no matter where you do it
[21:55:21] <checkit> Yeah....
[21:55:25] <checkit> I've tried a couple places
[21:55:31] <checkit> This thing is ruining my life!
[21:58:30] <jphase> I mean, it shows you're supposed to use .rules('add'  in the docs, but it looks like just calling validate() on the form works fine
[22:02:07] <jphase> checkit: feel free to change this, http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/4hbn9/5/
[22:04:53] <checkit> jphase: Still not able to get it validate that dynamically generated drop down?
[22:05:37] <jphase> oic, the nada has no value
[22:05:39] <jphase> gotcha
[22:09:12] <elijah_> thanks again jphase:
[22:09:57] <jphase> np
[22:13:08] <checkit> Grrr.. Everytime I try to use the .rules it cries about property of nodeName null
[22:14:52] <jphase> going to just do this very simply to see if it's something else...
[22:17:11] <checkit> That's kinda of what I tied to do as well. The actual form and other validation elements is much larger.
[22:17:26] <checkit> I tried to isolate this down to the essentials to figure out what is going wrong.
[22:21:54] <Hyperking> quick question..is it possible to read and write data to sql database using javascript?
[22:23:46] <checkit> Hyperking: You need a server side language to do that. You can use javascript to interact with the server....
[22:24:01] <dni> https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
[22:24:07] <dni> hypperking: https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql
[22:24:28] <Hyperking> checkit: server side language meaning node or php?
[22:24:50] <checkit> Yup
[22:25:03] <dni> check node.mysql
[22:25:38] <Hyperking> dni: looking to use sqlite. not node mysql or mongodb
[22:25:59] <Hyperking> sqlite is used in phone apps, why not web apps?
[22:26:28] <dni> hm
[22:39:42] <Uhkis> Hyperking: because it's slooooooooooooooooooow
[22:40:18] <Hyperking> eh??
[22:40:27] <jphase> checkit: eureka!
[22:41:16] <Uhkis> Hyperking: that's a reason not to use sqlite in webapps
[22:44:31] <jphase> checkit: it works if I remake this:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/CHG2m/1/
[22:45:08] <jphase> checkit: that nodeName and nodeType error appears to come from when the rules are added to an element that's not in a form container, so you have to apply the rules to the specific element after you append it.
[22:45:50] <checkit> jphase: I think you may be onto it there... I began looking at the dynamic <options> being generated... there is no value
[22:45:58] <jphase> saw that
[22:46:20] <jphase> you need values either way in order for required to fail or succeed
[22:46:32] <jphase> so .val('') will suffice as it will generate value=""
[22:47:12] <checkit> jphase: Holy shiznit man. That was it!~
[22:47:27] <checkit> jphase: I just added a blank val to test: http://jsfiddle.net/4hbn9/7/
[22:48:14] <jphase> :D
[22:52:10] <checkit> Shoot... It is hitting when I add the value but now it's not going regardless of what the value is.
[22:58:53] <Macaveli> Morning
[23:24:26] <add1> h
[23:33:02] <d3m0n> Sup guys, can someone take a look at this code and tell my why I am not getting a console lof visible and why it continues to add the click event when it's not hidden anymore - http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/hCFdo
[23:33:09] <d3m0n> console log*
[23:34:05] <jon_x2> can a <span> start and terminate anywhere or would it make bad html in some uses?
[23:34:10] <d3m0n> I had just else {} without the condition in there too but to no avail
[23:49:31] <nail_> d3m0n: this "if is hidden" test block is executed only once when document's ready, not on every click
[23:50:34] <d3m0n> nail_: ah! Why didn't I think of that
[23:50:36] <d3m0n> Ty
[23:51:35] <nail_> np
