[00:55:36] <soee> can i serialize array with jquery same as in php ?
[00:56:19] <Cork> JSON.serialize if that is what you mean
[00:56:30] <xec> JSON.stringify() ?
[00:56:46] <xec> soee: serialize to *what* though?
[00:56:51] <Cork> opps
[00:57:02] <Cork> sorry though of another language >_<
[00:57:17] <soee> xec, Columcille to store configuration array in cookie
[00:57:33] <soee> Cork, ^^
[00:59:21] <xec> soee: ok in that case, JSON should be fine. use JSON.stringify() to serialize and JSON.parse() to well.. parse
[01:00:03] <soee> ok will try, thank you xec
[01:00:14] <xec> soee: cookies are sent back and forth with every request though, so I wouldn't recommend saving a big array in a cookie
[01:00:46] <xec> soee: you could google "javascript local storage" instead for instance
[01:00:58] <xec> also eliminates the need to serialize
[01:01:16] <Cork> or even better use indexDB
[01:01:21] <Cork> *indexedDB
[01:01:35] <Cork> as localstorage is syncronical, so it affects loading time of every page
[01:11:58] <soee> ill take a look at this localstorage
[01:12:49] <Cork> ?mdn localstorage
[01:12:50] <b-ot> Cork: DOM Storage guide - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage

[01:16:04] <Stephen> Evening
[01:30:47] <vhsjon> hi guys, when an invalid number has been entered into a input type=number, how can I fetch the actual value that is written? It gets set to "", but I want to differentiate between if a user has written an invalid number, or if they havent written anything at all. When I use jquery to check with .val(), that value is "" both when something wrong is
[01:30:48] <vhsjon> written and when nothing is written.
[01:34:24] <soee> Cork, as i dont need huge amount of data to be stored its better to use localStorage than indexedDB?
[01:34:46] <Cork> soee: localStorage has better cross browser support
[01:35:00] <soee> Cork, ok thank you
[01:35:03] <Cork> but as the browser has to block page loading while it loads the data from disk
[01:35:21] <Stephen> vhsjon: Try using .text()
[01:35:22] <Cork> it will give you a penalty on page load
[01:35:31] <Cork> even if you arn't using localStorage on that page
[01:35:49] <Cork> steinart1: .text() don't work on input fields
[01:35:58] <Stephen> vhsjon: basically, you'll want to go after the text inside the <input> element
[01:36:01] <Cork> cause the value isn't content of it
[01:36:18] <Cork> it's an attribute
[01:36:29] <Stephen> Do type=number fields even allow for non-numeric characters?
[01:36:39] <Cork> no, that is the point
[01:37:14] <ashnur> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/0d68b7877f761264bfe4950e4df156b854925a6b/src/ajax.js#L616
[01:37:17] <Stephen> vhsjon: Your question is moot, browsers supporting that element wont allow other characters in the input
[01:37:49] <ashnur> great stuff. that code calls anything added on Object.prototype
[01:38:12] <vhsjon> Stephen: in chrome, if I write an "a", it shows in the html element
[01:38:16] <ashnur> using hasOwnProperty would be hard for jquery devs i guess
[01:42:50] <Cork> vhsjon: just checked through the dom element
[01:43:03] <Cork> vhsjon: and the browser doesn't expose the value at all if it is invalid
[01:43:21] <vhsjon> Cork: yes
[01:43:28] <Cork> vhsjon: so only two options you have is 1. use keydown and track what has been entered in the field
[01:43:45] <Cork> or 2. don't use type="number" if you want to be able to handle none numeric values
[01:44:05] <Cork> jquery isn't the limiting factor, it can't do anything
[01:44:25] <seutje> fuck that, draw it to a canvas and OCR it!
[01:44:30] <vhsjon> Cork: ok, that was my conclusion as well, just wanted to check if I missed something by not being able to fetch the raw value
[01:44:59] <Cork> vhsjon: i suspect this is a limit in how chrome has choosen to implement it
[01:45:13] <vhsjon> Cork: yeah
[01:46:03] <vhsjon> Cork: In my opinion the browser should refuse any non-numeric chars. So that it is possible to differentiate between invalid number and nothing
[01:46:20] <vhsjon> I guess I have to implement that myself :)
[01:46:28] <Cork> hmm i think you can actually
[01:46:38] <Cork> you can check the validity state of the field
[01:49:37] <Cork> vhsjon: http://jsfiddle.net/9T9Ej/
[01:52:44] <vhsjon> Cork: as I see it, that only tells if the element is valid or not, only bool properties, no actual values..
[01:52:53] <vhsjon> but correct me if im wrong
[01:53:16] <Cork> vhsjon: badInput != valueMissing
[01:53:26] <Cork> i think it says everything needed
[01:54:29] <Stephen> vhsjon: Note than any value that isn't valid would be stored in the Shadow DOM of that input element.
[01:54:40] <Stephen> Thus, it will be completely unaccessible
[01:55:21] <Stephen> The only way to keep the value accessible is to keep it valid, so you'll need to filter invalid incoming keypresses
[01:56:57] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[02:01:52] <greengriminal> I have following JsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U5JtP/16/ which takes in some input and renders it out in an output box.
[02:02:54] <greengriminal> My problem is that I want to use ace-editor to replicate this. You'll notice I cannot get ace-editor to render any output. Can anyone point me in the right direction thank you
[02:12:45] <soee> what would be the best wat if element has data-foo argument set and its  not empty ?
[02:12:50] <soee> *way
[02:13:04] <soee> to check ..
[02:16:23] <Cork> soee: .data('foo') === undefined
[02:17:02] <Cork> if you want empty too just do if(.data('foo'))
[02:26:36] <soee> Cork, how can i use .data to check data-* attribute on specific element ?
[02:26:45] <Cork> uh
[02:26:52] <Cork> that is what it is by default
[02:27:01] <Cork> $(elm).data('key')
[02:27:20] <Cork> there isn't any generic calls for it
[02:29:26] <soee> Cork, can you take a look: http://pastebin.com/drsbPDNU
[02:29:44] <soee> this will log twice 'y'
[02:29:59] <Cork> soee: you don't add the data- part in the call
[02:30:37] <xec> also, i think it translates to camelCase, so .data("tabsIdentifier")
[02:30:59] <Cork> no
[02:31:07] <Cork> it doesn't even support uppercase
[02:31:23] <soee> Cork, ok works now, thanks again
[02:31:50] <xec> <div data-tabs-identifier="">  can be read with .data("tabsIdentifier")
[02:32:40] <Cork> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/9MKKa/
[02:32:45] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[02:33:20] <xec> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/9MKKa/1/
[02:33:30] <Cork> ah
[02:33:35] <xec> so, both with dashes and camelcase will work, apparently
[02:34:01] <Cork> ya, i've used dashes plenty of time
[02:34:21] <Cork> though i tend to use json instead
[02:45:23] <soee> hard day today .. any idea why this wont add active lass to first list element: http://pastebin.com/yx9Snps5 ?
[02:46:50] <xec> soee: make a demo?
[02:52:10] <soee> xec, sorry it works i had data attribute defined thats why it couldnt add class
[02:59:08] <Cryp71c> Is there a version of .serializeArray() which - when building the object to be returned - puts uses the names of checked checkboxes as the key, rather than using a numerically-indexed array and having the name and value values as a sub-array?
[03:01:32] <soee> if i want to update local storage each time user change tab etc. is it good idea to do getItem() - this will return JSON.stringify(array) so i have to do now JSON.parse(value), update some key, again JSON.stringify and update localStorage ?
[03:02:25] <xec> soee: no need to stringify or parse, just store/read the array directly?
[03:03:00] <soee> xec, oh i thought can store plain arrays, will check
[03:03:06] <soee> *cant
[03:26:49] <fabioportieri> morning
[03:36:10] <bigbugjava> Hi, Question, if you guys need to upload atleast 10 photos per user, you dont have resources for private server, would you use external server(with API) or use your own db?, if so and use external, is there any recommenedtions?
[03:42:20] <Clex> bigbugjava: how do you host your website?
[03:47:16] <bigbugjava> Clex, now it's still on my computer, planning on loading it to amazon's (it's completly Javascript on Node.js)
[03:49:18] <fabioportieri> what should i learn, angularjs or nodejs ?
[03:49:54] <bigbugjava> fabio I love Node.js, doing the work with alot of easy NPM installs
[03:50:33] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri : what angularjs is it something similler to node.js server side tool ?!!
[03:53:31] <ali4ever4> ?
[03:54:46] <fabioportieri> ali4ever4: ?
[03:56:19] <fabioportieri> i didn't understand your question
[03:56:39] <fabioportieri> i was trying to figure out what's better between the two
[03:56:48] <fabioportieri> or what's different
[03:57:09] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: you use javaee as backend i presume?
[03:58:50] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri backend ? server-side?
[03:58:54] <bigbugjava> what do you mean?
[03:59:13] <fabioportieri> yes server side
[04:00:06] <bigbugjava> Node.js is server side tool
[04:00:40] <bigbugjava> javaee or lol
[04:00:44] <bigbugjava> javascript I use
[04:01:18] <machty> anyone here know how the jQuery object is constructed in JavaScript to be "array-like"? $('div') has a length, it shows up as an array in Chrome, etc
[04:01:28] <machty> but it doesn't seem to be an array "subclass"
[04:03:03] <Clex> machty: it is an array. An array of matching elements.
[04:03:25] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri: well i am really noob in node.js and know only the name of angulerjs but i thought node.js is serverside tool while angulerjs is front end databinding tool mainly , but that can be compeletly wrong
[04:03:25] <machty> Clex: but how does it get all of its jQuery methods, e.g. append, text, etc
[04:04:10] <Clex> jQuery kind of overloads the array object.
[04:04:32] <xec> Clex: do you even know what you're talking about?
[04:04:46] <xec> i mean, bro, do you even lift?
[04:05:18] <ali4ever4> machty: in JS arrays and objects are really very much mixed and inter-related array is just a special kind of objects
[04:05:43] <machty> $() instanceof Array
[04:05:47] <machty> $() instanceof Array => false
[04:05:58] <machty> [] instanceof Array => true
[04:06:04] <machty> assume i'm pretty good at JavaScript
[04:06:24] <fabioportieri> ali4ever4: i think you are right
[04:07:11] <machty> ahh relevant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7261670/what-makes-a-jquery-object-show-up-as-an-array-in-chromes-developer-tools
[04:07:32] <Serdar> hi all
[04:07:40] <soee> how can i create multidimentional array with some dynamic keys ?
[04:07:56] <Serdar> would you prefer a modal dialog for a login menu or something different?
[04:08:53] <machty> console.log({'0': 'asd','1': 'asd', length: 2, splice: function () {}}) => "["asd", "asd", splice: function]"
[04:09:29] <Clex> xec: s/overloads/imitate/ sorry.
[04:09:47] <ali4ever4> machty : thanks for sharing the link it is really nice information
[04:10:03] <xec> isn't it sort of odd that it logs the splice as part of the array (but not length)?
[04:13:24] <fabioportieri> ali4ever4: so one could do a full fledged webapp with just nodejs and angular?
[04:14:20] <ali4ever4> fabioportieri :  i  really don't know enough to answer
[04:14:33] <fabioportieri> i'll have to read some, thanks
[04:19:44] <ali4ever4> machty : more info on array like objects , thanks for telling me about such then  https://www.inkling.com/read/javascript-definitive-guide-david-flanagan-6th/chapter-7/array-like-objects
[04:20:32] <machty> xec: ali4ever4: a = { splice: [].splice, length: 0, push: [].push }; a.push(123); a => '[123]'
[04:20:52] <machty> ali4ever4: checking that out
[04:24:45] <ali4ever4> s
[04:38:25] <soee> why i can t assign this way value to object http://pastebin.com/46F5K180 ?
[04:38:55] <Cork> should work fine
[04:38:58] <Cork> oh wait
[04:38:59] <Cork> no
[04:39:12] <Cork> you can't addign identifier to 'tabs' cause tabs doesn't exist
[04:39:25] <Cork> so settings['tabs'] will be undefined
[04:40:26] <Cork> soee: http://pastebin.com/gQVYRas7
[04:54:11] <redfox75> hi to all, how I can decet if a bowser is ie (even 11) or other? .click not work with ie ...
[05:00:49] <seutje> redfox75: got example coads?
[05:01:11] <Cork> uh...
[05:01:19] <Cork> the bugtracker looks a bit busted...
[05:01:28] <redfox75> I haven't specific example ...
[05:01:47] <Cork> "OperationalError: (2006, 'MySQL server has gone away')" think i see the problem XD
[05:02:04] <redfox75> all that I try give me Mozilla
[05:03:53] <Cork> redfox75: you can parse the ua string, though that is quite easy to do wrong
[05:04:09] <Cork> its normally better to do feature test for the broken feature you have
[05:04:19] <Cork> if at all possible
[05:04:21] <seutje> especially if Mike Taylor finds out
[05:04:36] <Cork> seutje: go fix! http://bugs.jquery.com/
[05:04:37] <Cork> ;P
[05:04:45] <seutje> I don't have infrastructure rights
[05:05:07] <Cork> excuses excuses ^^
[05:05:16] <seutje> oh fuck no, this is python
[05:05:57] <seutje> most things still work though o.O
[05:06:05] <seutje> just not viewing the tickets
[05:06:32] <Cork> i think everything under bugs.jquery.com is down
[05:06:45] <seutje> it'll show up every now and then
[05:07:01] <seutje> mysql comes back ever 10 seconds or so
[05:14:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey guys
[05:19:54] <gary_b> if i write js/jquery primarily testing on 2 recent browsers, im i lickly to have the same amount of bother moving to other browsers as css?
[05:20:13] <gary_b> being a noob and all
[05:20:21] <trizz> Depens on the browsers you´ve used to test
[05:20:30] <gary_b> ie11 and latest chrome
[05:20:40] <gary_b> both workly without issue btw
[05:20:46] <Cork> well older ie's is a pain
[05:20:50] <gary_b> s/workly/work
[05:21:10] <Cork> chrome and firefox should be easy as long as you don't go too far back
[05:21:17] <Cork> opera; doesn't exist anymore
[05:21:26] <gary_b> cork: do i avoid most of the pain if i only support ie8+
[05:21:30] <trizz> I should also try IE9 and IE10
[05:21:37] <Cork> mobile is... a challenge to express it nicely
[05:21:53] <Cork> gary_b: well no
[05:22:01] <Cork> ie7 and 8 isn't much difference
[05:22:06] <gary_b> :(
[05:22:07] <Cork> but 10 should be safe
[05:22:32] <Cork> 9 is ok, but has some annoying short commings
[05:22:39] <gary_b> im using a lot of front end jquery on this one http://script.apphb.com/
[05:22:46] <Cork> 7 and 8 is better then 6 but still bad
[05:23:41] <SocialEvil> guys if a div is inside a html comment block, would jquery still be able to do something with it, or it ignores it ?
[05:24:10] <Cork> SocialEvil: if it is a comment it doesn't exist
[05:24:16] <Cork> then it's just text
[05:24:22] <Cork> in a comment element
[05:26:33] <SocialEvil> Cork, thanks
[05:36:10] <SocialEvil> i am writing google chrome simple extension for hiding the from the right side of the page, and the apps feed on the left side. here is my code for hidint the divs, http://pastebin.com/yRngdeeU the problem is.. when i refresh the page - it works. but when i view a profile or do something on the site, when i click the Facebook home button (upper left corner) the ads are hidden, but the apps feed are no
[05:36:10] <SocialEvil> te. i ttakes a refresh for the div to hide. any idea what may i be missing ?
[05:37:06] <SocialEvil> damn my keyboard sucks. sorry
[05:38:57] <jeremib> If I have an array of elements (span elements), how can I insert them all into another div?  $('#div').before()/after() seems close, but I want them to be inside the div.
[05:39:33] <Cork> ?api append @ jeremib
[05:39:34] <b-ot> jeremib: .append(): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[05:39:52] <jeremib> @Cork ahh, perfect.  thanks
[05:48:25] <jop008> I have this <div data-role="valuta" class="divinfo" id="cushion">&nbsp;</div> how to filter on valuta?
[05:48:54] <Cork> $('div[data-role="valuta"]')
[05:49:01] <Cork> or even better
[05:49:03] <jop008> Merci!!!
[05:49:07] <Cork> $('.cushion[data-role="valuta"]')
[05:49:11] <Cork> opps
[05:49:14] <Cork> $('[data-role="valuta"].cushion')
[05:49:33] <jop008> There are multiple valtua fields on the page
[05:49:40] <jop008> so I take the first one
[05:49:53] <Cork> both will return all of them
[05:49:58] <Cork> oh sorry
[05:50:00] <Cork> lol
[05:50:08] <Cork> took the id instead of the class name :x
[05:52:48] <greengriminal> I have the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/U5JtP/16/ which works to an extent. However I am trying to make it so that instead of the html being typed into a textarea and outputting in the iframe below. It uses Ace editor. I have two screenshots that may help of what i have now: http://i.imgur.com/Iu9aLrb.png and what i am trying to do: http://i.imgur.com/EVDScY4.png
[05:53:16] <greengriminal> So in other words what I am trying to do is get the contents from the ace editor rather than the textarea.
[05:56:15] <seutje> greengriminal: editor.getSession().getValue()
[05:59:52] <seutje> greengriminal: http://jsfiddle.net/U5JtP/17/
[06:03:30] <greengriminal> seutje: (y) That's what i was after :)
[06:12:57] <vjacob> hello everyone! If I wanted to open the contents starting with a certain <div> "content" block, what are my options normally?
[06:13:44] <vjacob> i.e. how do I simply access the content of said div block and display and/or link to links within this div block? XPath? XML? Scraping?
[06:14:26] <redfox75> any idea to how to solve ie11 problem?
[06:14:56] <Aquaword> hi
[06:18:31] <Cork> vjacob: dom is a tree, you don't really start at a point
[06:18:42] <Cork> vjacob: you normally show the content of a parent
[06:19:06] <Cork> you could grab all the siblings starting at a specific element if that is what your looking for
[06:19:26] <vjacob> Cork: so is there any way I could (similar to only showing a certain Frame or IFrame) select and show only the output of a <div block> ?
[06:20:09] <Cork> vjacob: sure, not sure what exactly your are trying to do
[06:21:14] <vjacob> Cork: just want to show some simple recipes/recipe links
[06:21:21] <vjacob> Cork: instead of showing the entire normal desktop webpage
[06:21:41] <Cork> vjacob: just make a partial server side
[06:21:42] <vjacob> Cork: so just focusing on a certain child elements from a certain <div> block and "then inward"
[06:21:47] <Cork> and send that instead of the full page
[06:22:18] <vjacob> not sure what a partial server side is * googling *
[06:22:29] <vjacob> most of the results talk about javascript and mvc
[06:22:44] <Cork> vjacob: i can only give generic tips as i have no context
[06:22:47] <mg983> Hi guys. Is it me or does jquery ui's .show() not accept a method for start (but jQuery has since 1.8 ..??)
[06:22:59] <Cork> but all language has a way to host partial content
[06:23:13] <vjacob> Cork: ok, fair enough, but can you give an example of such partial server side?
[06:23:24] <Cork> what language are you using?
[06:24:34] <Cork> vjacob: but basically a partial is that you split out parts of a page into its own file
[06:24:50] <Cork> and expose it as it's own url so if you want just that part you can request it instead of the full page
[06:25:05] <Cork> and then you include that partial in the full page to not duplicate the data
[06:29:09] <vjacob> Cork: Jquery Mobile
[06:29:13] <vjacob> sorry jQuery
[06:29:19] <vjacob> so JS
[06:29:23] <Cork> thats client side
[06:29:30] <Cork> i talk about server side
[06:29:37] <vjacob> ok
[06:29:53] <vjacob> so it is not doable on client side or is it a bad idea from some technical perspective?
[06:30:51] <Cork> you can
[06:31:03] <Cork> but that means pull the full data from the server
[06:31:06] <Cork> cross the wire
[06:31:11] <Cork> client side parse the full document
[06:31:31] <Cork> and pick out the div you want add it to the page and throw away all the other stuff
[06:31:42] <Cork> instead of just server side not sending what you don't need
[06:32:22] <Cork> so you can hack around it client side, but only server side can act on what shouldn't be there
[06:32:41] <Cork> (cause it has the data at hand)
[06:34:59] <mg983> Can someone help me out here -- I am animating padded text on a slider using show with jQuery UI -- but I want the show method to use inline block instead of block (I am firing on complete a method to make the text inline-block) you can see the issue here http://hypeworks.com/ any help is greatly appreciated!
[06:36:03] <redfox75> what's wrong with this and ie?   $.("#rank_1"  option[value=" + valore  + "]").hide(); (on firefox is ok
[06:36:35] <mg983> redfox75: try adding a single quote before opening the double quote and after closing it.
[06:36:48] <redfox75> ???
[06:36:54] <Cork> redfox75: the quotes doesn't look right
[06:37:06] <vjacob> Cork: wonderful. I salute thee.
[06:37:24] <vjacob> I appreciate it
[06:37:28] <vjacob> I think I will try to go server side.
[06:37:31] <vjacob> cheers!
[06:37:41] <mg983> Cork: Think you can take a look @ my issue? :)
[06:37:42] <Cork> redfox75: try $('#rank_1 option[value="' + valore  + '"]').hide();
[06:37:48] <redfox75> the second " after rank_! is an error when i put here
[06:37:52] <seutje> mg983: setting it to inline-block before doing the animation should fix that
[06:37:55] <redfox75> i'll try with '
[06:38:07] <Cork> mg983: i don't have time to dissect a page right now
[06:38:20] <mg983> seutje: how would I exactly do that? let me see
[06:38:40] <Cork> redfox75: don't forget the extra quites for the value
[06:39:33] <mg983> seutje: doing that undoes my animation
[06:40:15] <seutje> mg983: well yeah, then it's shown already
[06:40:48] <mg983> seutje: so that doesn't help :\
[06:41:21] <seutje> either animate opacity or try using a stepper
[06:43:02] <seutje> animating the dimensions instead of the opacity is already causing you to be forced to set a fixed height on the container
[06:43:07] <Forbidd3n> Not sure what channel to ask this in, but is anyone familiar or work with elfinder access control at all?
[06:44:56] <_rgn> somewhat on topic: is there a better way to check if array A contains all elements of array B? intersection(A, B) === B.length?
[06:46:22] <_rgn> .length missing
[06:47:12] <Cork> _rgn: only way i know to do it safely is to loop the first and check if it exists in the second one
[07:04:48] <javalover> hey guys i have a file tree here is my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/S5v4c/57/
[07:05:09] <javalover> my questino is, the files are not uniquely indexed, they simply have an id of say 2-1  which means Folder:2  File:1
[07:05:38] <javalover> but my code is designed so you can copy a file over to another folder.  What I want is that if the file exist, it doesn't copy but idk how to check for that
[07:06:34] <javalover> currently it checks for the id, but the id as you can see is 2-1   so inside folder 1,   it would just go "yeah 2-1 we totally have room for it as all we have is 1-1
[07:10:26] <javalover> oh nevermind i was hugely mistaken
[07:11:40] <javalover> i thought the id had to be based on the parent folder id. Turns out the id is completely manipulatable. So I just unique index the id, I can even use sql to manage it
[07:11:50] <javalover> thx for your time guys gonna fix code now
[07:13:01] <javalover> yeah works now see http://jsfiddle.net/S5v4c/59/
[07:13:25] <javalover> i might also change parent id anyways SUCCESS!!
[07:18:17] <dman777_alter> If I wanted to do foo = new Image(); foo.src = "/static/images/load_wheel.gif";....How could I place this in  $.blockUI({ message: $(foo.src).load(), overlayCSS: {...},.... })?
[08:10:42] <jimi_> Does anyone know of a similar framework to this? http://jquerypagewalkthrough.github.io/example/example.html
[08:10:54] <jimi_> I want to do a tutorial/walkthrough when you visit a page
[08:12:04] <Jon47> jimi_: there's one called tourist.js i think
[08:12:09] <Jon47> maybe it will meet your needs
[08:12:12] <Jon47> might not look exactly like that one
[08:12:58] <jimi_> Jon47: that looks perfect

[08:37:39] <zizzl> Hey guys, not looking for a responsive type plugin but I have an area that takes the <H1> and has to maintain a certain height so I can't have the text wrap, is there a plugin or couple lines that would say if the text is too large for one line then it decreases text size until it fits?
[08:37:47] <Jon47> I think the best copy to clipboard solution is to make it easy for the user to select the thing you want them to copy, and just let them do it using the myriad tools that come with the OS
[08:39:21] <airdem> Jon47, you are totally right but my boss wants that feature. anyways ive finally found a solution. thanks though
[08:40:27] <Jon47> airdem: alright, good luck man. it may be futile but it should be easy to convince a reasonable boss reinventing the wheel for a well-established standard feature is a wste of time
[08:41:04] <airdem> Jon47, reinventing the wheel seems to be the new black
[08:41:08] <airdem> at least for my boss
[08:41:36] <Jon47> that's a boss just begging to be displaced
[08:42:24] <airdem> :)

[09:10:42] <ThoMe> hihio
[09:11:12] <ThoMe> I need a confirmBox with no/yes. i have try this: $(this).confirmOn({ classPrepend: 'confirmon' }, 'click', function(e, confirmed) { });
[09:11:30] <ThoMe> but i would like run this when i load this document, not when i click
[09:11:32] <ThoMe> is it posible?
[09:14:02] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/ready/ @ ThoMe
[09:14:45] <ThoMe> NoiseEee: yes. i have $(document).ready(function() { }
[09:14:59] <ThoMe> but i need only confirmOn(... ?
[09:15:04] <ThoMe> or on click on load on ...?
[09:15:27] <NoiseEee> i'm not sure what confirmOn is, you'd have to look at the documentation of that plugin i guess
[09:16:04] <ThoMe> NoiseEee: the example is only $('#myButton').confirmOn('click', function(e, confirmed){
[09:16:12] <ThoMe> only when click do a div or or or ...
[09:16:24] <ThoMe> but i will not click or mouseover..
[09:16:35] <NoiseEee> i mean, regularly with a 'real' confirm, you'd just have    if(confirm('some question')) { //do stuff }   in there
[09:17:03] <NoiseEee> ThoMe: google around for documentation, we don't really support plugins here
[09:17:32] <ThoMe> NoiseEee: ok. thx.
[09:17:47] <valtido> hi guys
[09:17:52] <valtido> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:18:02] <valtido> Note: Only "successful controls" are serialized to the string.
[09:18:35] <NoiseEee> ok valtido, noted.
[09:18:46] <valtido> <button name="abc" value="123" >Test</button>
[09:18:53] <valtido> this does not serialize
[09:19:08] <valtido> http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2
[09:19:23] <wasim> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20526684/jquery-plugin-load-external-function-with-live
[09:19:25] <valtido> there is no mention of disqualifying the button[type=button]
[09:19:47] <NoiseEee> valtido: except you know what was pressed, so add that key/value pair to what you're sending
[09:20:31] <valtido> I wanted to know if this is a bug from jQuery or not first
[09:20:34] <NoiseEee> valtido: the .serialize() happens after you click the button, how would it know what to serialize?
[09:20:38] <NoiseEee> valtido: no its not a bug
[09:20:40] <snover> valtido: no. it is not a bug. read the second bullet in the list of bullets.
[09:20:48] <snover> “If a form contains more than one http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#buttons, only the activated submit button is successful.”
[09:21:01] <snover> serializing a form from JS activates no submit button
[09:21:06] <snover> so it is not valid
[09:21:08] <snover> so it is not included
[09:21:22] <valtido> button[type=button] and button[type=submit] are two different things
[09:21:39] <valtido> and should be treated as separate not one of the same thing.
[09:22:01] <snover> push buttons aren’t part of a form
[09:22:15] <NoiseEee> valtido: so you're saying you'd expect all buttons to be serialized then?
[09:22:56] <valtido> I was hoping to debate whether type=button should be treated as part of the form or not...
[09:24:17] <snover> http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#constructing-the-form-data-set
[09:24:20] <snover> it is even clearer in html5
[09:24:33] <snover> “The field element is a button but it is not submitter.”
[09:24:41] <snover> skipped
[09:24:41] <ThoMe> is this porible $("#button_3").confirmOn({  ... and then $("#button_3").click();
[09:24:42] <snover> the end
[09:24:49] <ThoMe> without the button/element with id #button_3 ?

[09:59:15] <shoky> opalepatrick: you didn;'t choose a build that include the 'inline' type
[09:59:30] <shoky> you chose:  build=image+gallery+imagezoom+fastclick

[10:05:58] <opalepatrick> thanks shoky - completely forgot I only did a partial build.
[10:07:18] <synth_> halp! i have a php page which generates div tags which need to have click, and hover events assigned to them. these elements are created after the page is technically "ready" so I cannot simply use $("#id_of_div") when referencing it. I've got this code so far, but it doesn't seem to work. any ideas? http://pastebin.com/ckeHchVz
[10:09:27] <JackBauer24> synth_: Use live method (http://api.jquery.com/live/) or assign events after creating the divs
[10:09:52] <synth_> i thought live was deprecated and replaced with "on" ?
[10:10:58] <shoky> don't use live
[10:11:26] <JackBauer24> right, my bad
[10:11:35] <NoiseEee> synth_: "this" in your examples will always be "document" because that's what the handler is on
[10:11:48] <shoky> NoiseEee: no, he's got a selector at the end
[10:11:53] <shoky> it seems ok to me
[10:12:05] <synth_> unfortunately it does not work with the selector :(
[10:12:25] <NoiseEee> synth_: where is "info_border_over" coming from?   mark up a fiddle too, its clearer.
[10:12:56] <synth_> my divs have the class echo "<div class='img_info_new' data-clip_url='".$$url."'>";
[10:13:19] <synth_> @NoiseEee those are constants set at the top of the document.
[10:13:24] <edoop> ei . any1  know  a good online free editor to use  jquery advanced
[10:13:37] <edoop> free o share
[10:13:50] <synth_> edoop http://jsfiddle.net/  ?
[10:14:02] <edoop> thank you . i know this
[10:14:06] <NoiseEee> synth_: pretty sure jquery (or js, for that matter) takes things like "data-Monkey_town" on elements to "data-monkeytown"
[10:14:22] <NoiseEee> synth_: so use "data-monkeytown" in markdown.
[10:14:23] <edoop> i mean  like IDE+SDK
[10:14:41] <shoky> he's got the attributes/data fine i think
[10:14:51] <shoky> underscores are preserved
[10:15:00] <synth_> @edoop i use komodo edit, it has autocomplete for jquery
[10:15:11] <NoiseEee> uppercase/lowercase isnt though, im almost 100% on that, but lets get a fiddle going synth_
[10:15:18] <Guest22161> Hi, I've a select named rank_3, i wanto to set not disabled the value "oldValue" ... what is wrong here?   $('#rank_3  option[value=' + oldValueRank_1  + ']').prop( 'disabled', false );
[10:15:19] <edoop> Komodo is IDE?
[10:15:23] <wasim> can some one help please...http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20526684/jquery-plugin-load-external-function-with-live
[10:15:43] <shoky> well uppercase/lowercase would change only if there were dashes ;p
[10:15:44] <synth_> @NoiseEee the syntax works when i have the elements static on the page rather than generating them
[10:16:20] <edoop> synth_ what's your best editor?
[10:16:42] <Guest22161> any suggestion? I can set prop("disabled", true) ....
[10:16:44] <synth_> @edoop so far on windows i use komodo edit, or i putty to a linux machine and use vim
[10:17:22] <synth_> http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit
[10:17:23] <NoiseEee> synth_: there is nothing obviously wrong with your script, create a jsfiddle showing it not working.
[10:17:39] <shoky> synth_: http://jsfiddle.net/3fnvB/
[10:17:42] <edoop> Do you like sw of adobe?
[10:17:49] <edoop> what do you think about adobe suite?
[10:17:57] <synth_> @NoiseEee not sure how i'd get the php embedded in there to generate the elements though
[10:17:59] <b-ot> synth_: getthephpembeddedintheretogeneratetheelementsthough.com - ☺ AVAILABLE
[10:18:09] <synth_> wtf
[10:18:11] <NoiseEee> synth_: "view source"?  maybe the issue is with php?  what is your console saying?
[10:18:13] <shoky> lol
[10:19:08] <synth_> there aren't any php errors
[10:19:11] <synth_> the php is fine.
[10:19:47] <edoop> synth,  can you suggest  me  a project to work simultaneus  with friend or developer
[10:19:48] <NoiseEee> synth_: im saying perhaps what javascript is *expecting* from php isn't quite right
[10:19:57] <edoop> to improve source
[10:20:10] <NoiseEee> synth_: anyways, nobody here has ESP or a crystal ball, but good luck.  maybe peek at http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[10:21:17] <dopie> how do i make the div fade in when it gets visible??
[10:21:21] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/ZbzNa/
[10:21:53] <edoop> nice project fixingthesejquery.com
[10:22:24] <shoky> dopie: .fadeIn()  ?
[10:22:41] <Guest22161> any suggest why prop('disabled', false) not work?
[10:23:00] <shoky> Guest22161: it works. make a jsfiddle
[10:23:56] <dopie> shoky,  can you edit my fiddle to see how would i do that?
[10:24:14] <shoky> dopie:  fadeIn()  instead of show()
[10:24:19] <dopie> ha!
[10:27:35] <yash069> so my problem is the html form does get method as its default and jQuery ajax i wrote does post, both of them are done together.. i dont wont get and post both.

[10:28:19] <Guest22161> http://jsfiddle.net/xqHy6/
[10:28:41] <Guest22161> The idea will libe to hide and show instead to disable
[10:29:48] <airdem> why is it that some elements height attribute is "real" and some other elements height attribute is the sum of hieight + padding + border ?
[10:31:09] <Guest22161> i'm going mad ... on disabled problem .... seems so simple ...
[10:31:34] <fabioportieri> and even today almost 12 work hours
[10:32:25] <shoky> Guest22161: so.. what's not working?
[10:32:41] <shoky> airdem: it depends on the box-sizing css property. and mm maybe other things
[10:33:13] <airdem> shoky, box-sizing is everywhere the same unless i change it explicitly, right?
[10:33:28] <Velveeta> not necessarily
[10:33:34] <Guest22161> eg select a from the first, on all a will be disable. after select b from a, on all a should be no more disabled and b disabled
[10:34:23] <Guest22161> shoky: but eg in select box 2 the a is no more active ...
[10:34:54] <shoky> Guest22161: it does what you said, a is no longer disabled after i choose b
[10:36:06] <Guest22161> shoky: on second select box?
[10:36:33] <shoky> Guest22161: on all of them
[10:37:45] <shoky> Guest22161: ah tried now on firefox, i see the problem
[10:38:15] <Guest22161> ok
[10:39:01] <synth_> i don't think this on() is working properly at all.
[10:39:04] <Guest22161> shoky: my goal will be to set show and hide instead disabled. I made and with firefox was working, but no with ie
[10:40:08] <shoky> synth_ as you can see in my fiddle, it works just fine
[10:40:55] <synth_> @shoky, in mine i decided to use the selector "div" so that it would select all div elements to see if it would at least capture the divs i'm generating with php. it does not.
[10:41:15] <synth_> all divs respond to mouseenter and mouseleave except for the ones i generated.

[10:41:55] <retsie> is there any function that does that?
[10:42:08] <shoky> Guest22161: the problem is that you are depending on the "focus" event
[10:42:28] <manus> Hey folks, I got a quick probable-bug-or-inconsistency / maybe-undocumented-design-decision in jQuery UI, fiddle here : http://jsfiddle.net/gj5nZ/
[10:42:34] <synth_> @shoky all code: http://pastebin.com/M81Xva9c (this is a .php file that is loaded into another php file so that's why it's lacking all other necessary html elements)
[10:42:37] <Guest22161> there's another way to catch the old value?
[10:42:50] <synth_> (the code is still very rough(
[10:42:50] <synth_> )
[10:42:58] <manus> Basically traced it to a "bad" regex: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/47db52b9c98a5c593eb86e5b75309568d11b3bef/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L417
[10:43:15] <manus> should probably be something more like:  /^([\w-]+)\s*(.*)$/  or, even better(?), something like:  /^([^\s.]+)\s*(.*)$/  ??
[10:44:36] <manus> didn't want to nor have time to register for the forum, so reported it here.. need to run away now, but I'll come back to check the logs later

[11:08:47] <JackBauer24> sparr: since that code isn't extendable, you have to overwrite the whole behaviour
[11:09:28] <sparr> JackBauer24: I'm really hoping that's not true. This is just a narrowed down test case, but the actual code bases in question are tens of thousands of lines of code
[11:11:37] <JackBauer24> sparr: well, in Javascript you can't just burst into the middle of the method execution and do what you please. You can't do this without modifing the script, unless it has some mechanisms implemented allowing for extending the code
[11:22:57] <alexkinnee> Anyone here attending jQuery San Diego?
[11:24:32] <arschmitz> alexkinnee: im speaking at it

[11:24:52] <alexkinnee> I will be there by myself.

[11:32:16] <alexkinnee> arschmitz: ^^ followed you
[11:32:39] <arschmitz> cool
[12:25:03] <wassup> hi
[12:25:19] <wassup> how can I return the value of an input placeholder on focus?
[12:30:37] <rupl> does jQuery emit an event when it has loaded? I am attempting to support someone who has a jQuery-dependent script inside Modernizr.load() -- but jQuery is loaded syncronously after Modernizr.load() — and it's causing a race condition.
[12:58:22] <Dirkos> If i have a node and i only want the inside text? How should i do it? For example: I got the element H2 with the content "here is some text <span>and some subdata</span>"
[13:00:10] <NoiseEee> Dirkos: text()
[13:01:18] <Dirkos> NoiseEee: no you are wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/nFPD3/
[13:01:22] <Dirkos> i dont need the subtext
[13:01:36] <NoiseEee> Dirkos: your question wasn't clear.
[13:01:46] <Dirkos> ah well sorry in that case
[13:01:47] <Ansikt> Hi - I have two radio buttons.  When I click on one radio button, the other one becomes unselected.  I bound a 'change' event to each radio, but only the one which is becoming **checked** is firing, but not the one which is becoming **unchecked**
[13:01:55] <Ansikt> is there an alternative event I can use for this?
[13:01:55] <Dirkos> i want the text but not the result in the span
[13:02:14] <Dirkos> NoiseEee: so in my example i just need the "Some text"
[13:04:38] <NoiseEee> Dirkos: something like this would work, but it seems heavy-ish http://jsfiddle.net/nFPD3/1/
[13:06:52] <Dirkos> NoiseEee: seems not very "easy" indeed... anyone else with some thoughts?
[13:07:00] <NoiseEee> well its sure easy
[13:07:13] <NoiseEee> it really depends on what your use cases are like
[13:08:01] <Velveeta> yeah, noiseeee's probably got the simplest solution, the other would be to iterate over .contents() and typecheck for text nodes and concat them
[13:08:21] <Velveeta> but children() grabs all non-text nodes, so just removing them and then grabbing the text() of what's left over is probably the easiest way
[13:08:59] <Dirkos> k thnx
[13:09:04] <grafi> grabbing textnodes
[13:09:06] <grafi> :O
[13:54:28] <wassup> http://pastebin.com/eFLi1JFi - I've created something like this, but apparently there is a lot of code duplication. How would you advise to get rid of it?
[13:55:16] <alexkinnee> it looks fine to me
[13:55:37] <alexkinnee> whoever is saying it's duplicated must not realize that "field.attr('id')" is dynamic
[13:55:53] <wassup> alexkinnee: I say so, yet I come from the dry background :)
[13:56:07] <grafi> deserts are dry
[13:56:16] <alexkinnee> there really isn't duplication in there though
[13:56:28] <wassup> alexkinnee: thanks for your opinion, I will keep it as is, thus
[13:56:35] <alexkinnee> np
[13:57:01] <grafi> you could probably write a function to reduce code though
[13:57:26] <grafi> although its probably not worth it in this example
[13:57:30] <alexkinnee> I think, with the current number of lines, adding a function would actually add more code.
[13:57:32] <alexkinnee> exactly.
[13:58:01] <wassup> grafi: perhaps not, I thought I could chain or whatsoever, so on :blur the state would rollback
[13:58:22] <alexkinnee> I'm not aware of the ability to do that.
[13:58:48] <Velveeta> well, you could chain the focus/blur event bindings
[13:58:50] <Velveeta> but that's about it
[13:58:58] <Velveeta> so you'd save a 2nd parse through the dom for 'input'
[13:59:23] <alexkinnee> that's true
[13:59:31] <wassup> Velveeta: by simply followin with .blur()?
[13:59:46] <alexkinnee> so at your first }); take off the ; and chain your .blur there
[13:59:55] <Velveeta> $('input').focus(function).blur(function2);
[13:59:59] <Velveeta> yepyep
[14:00:03] <alexkinnee> eliminating the second input selector
[14:00:13] <Velveeta> but that's about as much as you can easily crunch that code
[14:00:29] <wassup> Velveeta: thanks :)
[14:00:37] <Velveeta> no problem
[14:00:55] * Velveeta hands 1/3 of the thanks to each of alexkinnee and grafi.
[14:00:55] <wassup> fair enough, seems nice
[14:01:04] <wassup> thanks alexkinnee & grafi as wel
[14:01:05] <wassup> *well
[14:01:06] <Velveeta> :D
[14:01:45] <alexkinnee> You are welcome. :)
[14:01:56] <grafi> wassup http://jsfiddle.net/8g3DV/
[14:01:57] <grafi> :P
[14:02:30] <wassup> grafi: :D
[14:02:37] <grafi> but you see, its really not that helpful
[14:03:05] <Velveeta> now remove all the whitespace and gzip it!
[14:03:06] <wassup> yeah, but I at least recalled about the handlers
[14:03:30] <grafi> thats something different than chaining though
[14:03:41] <wassup> yes, indeed
[14:03:56] <wassup> I've just read jquery tutorial ~2-3 months ago and have not touched it since
[14:04:07] <wassup> thus, a lot is gone in terms of what I have learnt
[14:04:11] <grafi> sure way to forget everything ^^
[14:04:14] <alexkinnee> grafi: That functionality is not the same as his
[14:04:23] <alexkinnee> You're doing the same thing for both focus and blur
[14:04:41] <grafi> but it's toggle instead of show/hide
[14:04:47] <grafi> so starting with hidden inputs
[14:04:50] <alexkinnee> Yes, it's not the same.
[14:04:53] <grafi> it should be the same
[14:05:29] <alexkinnee> his is saying WHEN blur THEN hide, WHEN focus THEN show
[14:06:00] <grafi> so?
[14:06:02] <Velveeta> it would essentially behave the same, unless they got out of sync somehow
[14:06:03] <alexkinnee> yours is saying WHEN blur or focus THEN if visible hide else show
[14:06:22] <wassup> yeah, the point is, if out-of-sync, the actions could get reversed
[14:06:27] <alexkinnee> yup
[14:06:29] <wassup> thus, being explicit is safer
[14:06:33] <alexkinnee> yep
[14:06:55] <grafi> try to get it out of sync
[14:06:56] <grafi> :P
[14:07:05] <wassup> try your users not to d-:
[14:07:27] <alexkinnee> You can't assume what the current state of things is.

[14:07:44] <webtroll> Any ideas ?
[14:08:09] <webtroll> I've seen that select options  do not receive the click event (from what I gather)

[14:44:06] <mvp_graff> I'm having an issue where I have a loading screen after a form submit happens, it works on all browsers except Safari.
[14:45:02] <mvp_graff> It's like Safari ignores it https://gist.github.com/anonymous/543ad950c3c02eb65d61, that's the submit function of it.
[14:45:25] <mvp_graff> ffffff it didnt post lol
[14:47:06] <mvp_graff> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7936934
[14:47:21] <mvp_graff> I layered it the way it's suppose to work.
[14:49:03] <NoiseEee> mvp_graff: why an iframe?
[14:49:30] <NoiseEee> mvp_graff: and what's the deal with <iframe src='something'> <p>WTF is this doing here</p>  </iframe>
[14:49:56] <NoiseEee> why wouldn't "loadingmsg" be something like just a graphic/modal ?
[14:50:12] <mvp_graff> cause it has a timerbar in it
[14:50:29] <mvp_graff> so I just load an iframe to load the timerbar
[14:50:35] <snover> just in case you need to support netscape 4
[14:50:40] <NoiseEee> i don't really know what a 'timerbar' is
[14:50:53] <NoiseEee> but i can't see any reason to have an iframe involved
[14:51:33] <mvp_graff> sorry
[14:51:36] <mvp_graff> its a progress bar
[14:51:52] <NoiseEee> progress of a form submission?
[14:55:27] <mvp_graff> yea
[14:55:42] <mvp_graff> cause it routes to a different server then back to me
[14:56:22] <NoiseEee> and how were you planning then on tracking/calculating such progress?
[14:56:33] <NoiseEee> a: mostly just an illusion
[14:56:39] <mvp_graff> ^
[14:56:54] <mvp_graff> it takes like a few seconds, its just for UX
[14:56:56] <NoiseEee> a: so use a <div> with a graphic in it that says "NOW CALCULATING YOUR AWESOME SUBMISSION" etc
[14:57:06] <NoiseEee> again, cant see any purpose whatsoever for an iframe.
[14:57:45] <jwmann> How would I take this and make it output a JSON object like this (based on what's checked) { "Category A" : [ { "1" : "A" } , { "2" : "B" } , { "5" : "E" } ] } - http://jsfiddle.net/Ubb8R/3/
[14:57:53] <mvp_graff> Hmm, so you think that safari is just ignoring the iframe then
[14:58:02] <mvp_graff> alrighty then
[15:03:46] <terry1988> hi guys, I'm using royal slider, I want to apply smoothzoom to an image within it. how do I select it as it's generated after the dom is loaded?
[15:21:55] <terry1988> Hi boys, I'm using this: $(document).on('click','.rsImg', function(){ .. but how do I get it to run the function automatically? I've tried, 'load', 'hover'...
[15:24:08] <NoiseEee> according to that, the function would automatically run if you clicked something with the class '.rsImg'
[15:24:12] <NoiseEee> i don't get your Q
[15:26:08] <terry1988> NoiseEee: sorry.. I want it to load smooth zoom after the royalslider has loaded...
[15:26:32] <terry1988> so basically I want the function to run once .rsImg is available.
[15:31:08] <NoiseEee> then use DOM ready http://api.jquery.com/ready/   $(function() { $('img.rsImg').on('load',function() { //this will fire when all the images with that class have loaded });
[15:32:06] <NoiseEee> good day all
[15:37:55] <terry1988> NoiseEee_: even if they've been loaded with ajax?
[15:54:54] <KevQSweet> hello im new to jquery, how do i include iit in my document first of all?

[17:46:49] <raj> if I load an html page using ajax, how do i run the script tag contained within?
[17:48:10] <shoky> it's best not to do that ;S
[17:48:49] <raj> well, I want to set a window variable in the script tag
[17:49:15] <raj> I use my template renderer to put some JSON to the variable
[17:51:03] <shoky> why are you loading json using an .html page?
[17:54:03] <raj> <script>window.mysite.file_info = {'some':'object', 'notactualjson':'mybad'}; renderFileInfo(window.mysite.file_info)</script>
[17:54:11] <raj> shoky, so I can do that ^^
[17:54:41] <grafi> just because you can ...
[17:54:43] <grafi> :P
[17:55:19] <raj> that way the page is loaded ready and i don't have to send ajax request to the server after the page is ready
[17:55:24] <raj> it removes that delay
[17:57:22] <raj> but it works on a hard load, not on an ajax load of the page
[18:00:03] <raj> what's a better paradigm?
[18:04:50] <shoky> i donno, something cleaner ;p  hard for me to think of a good answer without knowing much more bout what you're doing
[18:10:04] <shoky> anyways the script should be run when you append the html to the dom
[18:21:16] <raj> so essentially I need to put that associative array object in a data-* attribute on an element instead of within a script tag that sets a window variable
[18:22:36] <raj> cuz no other choice?
[18:23:49] <shoky> dunno what you need
[18:24:02] <shoky> i need pizza
[18:28:30] <grafi> i want a unicorn
[18:51:01] <zulcc> using the jquery.form plugin, submitting a form to write.php, what would i place inside of write.php to "return success" so that ajaxForm continues with the actions bound to the success return?
[18:52:00] <Velveeta> you don't have to put anything inside the response really, it just has to be a successful request/response transaction, as in no error thrown from the server
[18:52:14] <Velveeta> all the browser has to receive is a 200 header, even with an empty response
[18:52:15] <grafi> Velveeta :P
[18:52:22] <Velveeta> grafi: :p
[18:52:24] <synth_> if you really wanted you could reply with some json data
[18:52:32] <Velveeta> i typically do
[18:52:42] <zulcc> Velveeta, synth_: ahh. thanks
[18:52:43] <Velveeta> at a minimum, something like { success: true }
[18:52:49] <synth_> ^
[18:52:58] <grafi> It's alright it's ok
[18:53:12] <synth_> would a crashing php page still report 200?
[18:53:21] <Velveeta> probably not
[18:53:32] <Velveeta> i would think it'd give a 500 or something else
[18:53:37] <synth_> ah
[18:53:41] <Velveeta> although depending on the nature of error handing n the server
[18:53:45] <grafi> depends on the error, doesnt it
[18:53:45] <grafi> :P
[18:53:46] <synth_> i still think it's good to return some sort of json data though
[18:54:03] <Velveeta> it could serve up a redirected error catch-all page, which would have a 200 response, with friendly error text in it
[18:54:27] <grafi> Velveeta is a unicorn

[19:09:51] <grafi> why what how
[19:12:02] <zulcc> in the quick start guide on http://malsup.com/jquery/form/ , the $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() { alert("success"); }); is placed in $(document).ready(function() { }); . can i place the .ready(function) in the middle of the body within <script> tags?

[19:18:26] <zulcc> disregard my question
[19:19:04] <grafi> zulcc no problem ;)
[19:32:24] <zulcc> i must be misunderstanding something, when i $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function() { alert("success") }); as simple as that, it is not supposed to actually load the action="write.php", is it? or would that be something like $('#myForm').ajaxForm(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); what i'm looking for?
[19:34:04] <zulcc> i want to stay on the same page that contains the <form>, but it's actually loading the .php given in the <form action="thisone.php">, as if it was a plain old html form
[19:34:51] <zulcc> or is that just an indicator that my binding of .ajaxForm has failed for some reason?
[19:35:56] <shoky> zulcc: it's supposed to load whatever you put in the action attribute, yes
[19:36:08] <shoky> via ajax
[19:37:51] <shoky> but it doesn't change the page you're on
[19:38:43] <zulcc> ah! then my binding fails somehow. not getting any script errors, but it is changing the page to thisone.php
[19:40:37] <shoky> ya you got some other problem
[19:43:10] <zulcc> $('#content-wrapper').load('display.php', function() {   $('#myFormOnDisplay').ajaxForm(function() { alert("success"); }); });    just throwing in some random snippets, yell when you see something horribly wrong ;p
[19:44:15] <shoky> my first guess is you have duplicate ids
[19:44:34] <shoky> duplicate/wrong
[19:52:39] <zulcc> shoky: bingo! duplicate id. i hate my spaghetti code. thanks
