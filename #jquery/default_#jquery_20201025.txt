[13:59:19] <Sal> how can i listen to an event of an anchor inside an appended code?
[13:59:46] <Sal> i'm trying to query the anchor id + event class
[14:00:21] <Sal> but i'm afraid that when I start the listener, the code is not yet in the DOM
[14:01:27] <Sal> can I listen to an event on the toppest level?
