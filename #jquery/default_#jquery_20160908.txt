[03:59:28] <tomasm-> anyone know of some sort of pre-built library that works with bootstrap modals as well as implements ajax links and forms via data- attributes as well as process json responses? i was just hoping something was pre-built for minimal coding
[03:59:37] <tomasm-> ie especially not needing to use script tags directly
[04:54:37] <xdevnull> anyone around?
[05:00:48] <Cork> xdevnull: if you have a question just ask it, ppl will answer if they know the answer and have the time
[05:20:31] <xdevnull> https://jsfiddle.net/85z6oL6e/ In this example, I'm switching between two td's one is draggable and one is droppable
[05:21:08] <xdevnull> My question, how do i make them droppable/draggable over again? that would be duplicaiton of code, is there any other ways
[05:21:35] <xdevnull> I'm not sure if you can understand me, but if u see example will be better to understand
[06:16:28] <Tennis> xdevnull thats cool
[06:18:34] <Tennis> I wonder if im looking at an updated working vers
[06:49:56] <hellyeah> yo
[06:50:00] <hellyeah> Cork:  yesterday yo told me "treewalker"
[06:50:09] <hellyeah> i am reading article, nodeiterator was meantioned
[06:50:14] <hellyeah> these are similar
[06:56:37] <hellyeah> ?
[08:09:45] <jac0bz1> Hello! :) Don't know how to explain this.. But, If I want to add/remove a class on hover to every element with the class "abc". But not to the parent class. so say i have <div class="abc"><p class="abc">test</p></div> and mouse enters the paragrap, then that one will get the hover-class, but not the parent div.. makes sense?
[08:12:21] <Cork> jac0bz1: you want to only add it to the element hovered?
[08:13:16] <jac0bz1> yes
[08:25:14] <bongjovi> Would anyone know why something like $('.myClass').css({"height":"auto","max-height":100}); might not be applying the max-height property inline on IE11?
[08:54:43] <shoky_> bongjovi: working fine for me
[09:06:56] <bongjovi> shoky_: thanks, it turned out to be a flexbox bug
[09:06:59] <bongjovi> but found a workaround
[09:10:02] <bongjovi> the max-height property was only being set under a certain condition, and the condition wasn't met because flexbox was rendering differently on IE
[09:47:16] <RilaX> hi !
[11:14:13] * taplar crickets
[11:27:18] <pavlealeksic> Hi there, could someone help me figure out how to center this orange element to the center of the checkbox no matter the height of the td? https://jsfiddle.net/tc5s84ns/41/
[11:33:23] <pavlealeksic> It should be a pretty simple task but for me it's not, I'm trying to solve it for 2 days.
[11:34:02] <stevenm> is there anything built into jquery (e.g. something where I can just source ajax.google..) which can sort html tables?
[11:34:31] <pavlealeksic> I'm not approaching it well I think tried to get it back with transform: translateY() with the same amount I give to position: top but then it's stuck
[11:43:37] <taplar> stevenm: not that i'm aware of
[11:43:57] <taplar> pavlealeksic: i don't see an orange element in that fiddle
[11:44:18] <pavlealeksic> Oh sorry forgot to mention that you need to click on 2 checkbox
[11:44:25] <pavlealeksic> that's when jQUery activate it
[11:47:08] <decx> stevenm: jquery collections have the same sort() as arrays
[11:47:43] <decx> so you can sort rows by a specific childs property
[12:36:35] <VectorX> hi, how can i make the guitar chords in this example bold, say adding a <span> around the chords or something https://jsfiddle.net/xy86qd5j/1/
[12:37:04] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[12:37:10] <robertmaxrees> using jquery?
[12:37:15] <VectorX> yes
[12:37:20] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be really difficult.
[12:37:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to tokenize them somehow.
[12:37:33] <VectorX> there are other chords ofcourse
[12:37:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to account for modifiers like Aug, Dim, slash chords, etc.
[12:38:31] <VectorX> yeah
[12:39:16] <robertmaxrees> hrml.
[12:39:26] <robertmaxrees> this for personal use?
[12:39:33] <VectorX> yeah
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> do what i've been doing then: don't even try lol
[12:39:56] <robertmaxrees> copy into a google doc and just bold there.
[12:40:17] <VectorX> well its for personal use, then i have to put to on a site
[12:40:19] <VectorX> ;)
[12:40:30] <VectorX> where other people submit chords
[12:40:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd use markdown or something else.
[12:41:08] <VectorX> they would be just copying and pasting from like notepad or atom or what ever, so similar to what you see in the html view
[12:41:34] <robertmaxrees> heh, i've been playing guitar for over 15 years - i'm aware of what this is ;)
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> you're going to be SOL unless you don't require some manual formatting.
[12:42:20] <VectorX> im thinking community based
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> right - like almost every other tab site in existence :D
[12:42:42] <VectorX> hehe
[12:45:44] <cwek> Hi, I have one problem and need some suggestions. Well I'm gettin Ads from DFP (Doubleclick For Publishers). Sometimes I get blank ads. .collapseEmptyDivs() is not working. Div, let call him ad-placeholder has some content in it (iframe..) but it's blank. How can I check if there's no content, if it's blank and then .hide() it?
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> cwek i'd fix your dfp setup instead if possible.
[12:47:40] <robertmaxrees> since the race conditions are going to be way jank.\
[12:47:47] <cwek> robertmaxress: hm.. Do you maybe think the problem is in code because I'm adding div id's dynamically? $().attr(...) and then I'm calling defineSlot and display. The first ad always gets some content, but the second only few times
[12:48:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe a race on your end to me.
[12:48:08] <robertmaxrees> what if you statically have the ads in content?
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> err, the placeholders.
[12:48:50] <cwek> It's not possible since I'm receive html code from api
[12:48:55] <cwek> receiving*
[12:49:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[12:50:30] <cwek> I can share URL with you if it would help
[12:50:35] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[12:50:44] <robertmaxrees> can't really sit here debugging another site's dfp setup ;)
[12:50:57] <cwek> :)
[12:52:20] <cwek> Also the second Ad is hidden (it's inside the read-more content)
[12:52:42] <robertmaxrees> wonder if that's part of why?
[12:53:13] <cwek> Don't rly know, I'm doing first time with dfp
[12:53:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd dive through their docs and solve those issues instead.
[12:55:05] <cwek> I've tried.. Well the most interesting part is that ad is not always blank.. sometimes it get's content
[12:55:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> don't band-aid that issue with jquery is what i'm saying :)
[12:55:36] <cwek> I'm defining slot when page loads, but displaying it when the readMore event is triggered..
[12:55:50] <cwek> Hm..
[12:56:29] <cwek> Since I don't have the access to DFP , and they still claim that it's our job not to display blank ads it's kinda hard..

[13:19:43] <VectorX> decx hope you are playing it atleast
[13:32:42] <momomo> is it a good idea to get scripts, text, html, and css over websockets rather than using multiple requests to do it ? i am thinking especially on mobile devices where a connection can get dropped..
[13:32:51] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[13:32:58] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use websockets personally.
[13:33:05] <robertmaxrees> package your assets down and compress instead.
[13:34:23] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i do that already .. but i was thinking of optimizing further .. but I do think a dropped connection would require a reconnection and unsure what happens with requests in between in such circumstances
[13:34:46] <decx> that's why you want to have a build prozess where you can genarate minimal assets depending on the situation to satisfy for example google page speeds incessant whining by creating landingpage specific above-the-fold styles
[13:35:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i wouldn't use sockets there.  not really going to solve that problem.
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> plus dns caching is a real thing. and your browser can download multiple assets at a time.
[13:37:53] <momomo> decx, it is really difficult to determine the appropiate amount of bundling ... another issue that arises is that when a bundle changes, then all has to be reloaded .. ideally, i am against bundling for that reason .. if a resource changes, only that part should have to be reloaded
[13:38:21] <decx> well that's the beauty of bundlers, you set it up once
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> momomo we regularly bust cache on our frontend assets and it's not as big of a problem as you'd think.
[13:38:42] <momomo> but I do think the non default cashing is a problem with websockets
[13:39:00] <xdevnull> https://jsfiddle.net/85z6oL6e/  anyone know how to swap between draggable and droppable in this example?
[13:39:11] <xdevnull> Like i need to swap behavior too
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> you can also break things apart so you have a base "lib" type file that handles all the generally static, unchanging stuff and then have a separate file that regularly changes.  best of both worlds.
[13:39:33] <momomo> robertmaxrees, the problem is that you build a bundle too big and you have to keep break it for any change
[13:39:43] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[13:39:44] <momomo> there is no real knowing of what a good size bundle should be
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> it's really not that bad.
[13:40:07] <momomo> robertmaxrees, it depends on how often your application is updated
[13:40:09] <robertmaxrees> you're not, like, bundling every page's js together into one big file right?
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> we update ours multiple times a week.
[13:40:51] <momomo> and you break it every time .. we are talking about optimizing the page load ..
[13:40:59] <momomo> even when change occurs
[13:41:00] <robertmaxrees> premature optimization is a killer.
[13:41:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry, should've lead with that.
[13:41:15] <robertmaxrees> don't solve problems you're not having.
[13:43:11] <momomo> it's not about solving any problems .. it's about choosing a path that is optimal .. there is no real difference in cost other than some intial development cost.. but we are way past that .. and it's an easy change ... i am just theorizing at this moment
[13:43:35] <momomo> but if one wants to handle cache for websockets .. would one have to do that using localStorage you think?
[13:43:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:16] <momomo> did I say something funny?
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> feel free to ignore me ;)
[13:45:17] <bomb> Yours is my favorite nickname. Few mo's are missing, though.
[13:46:32] <robertmaxrees> for what it's worth, yeah you'd have to handle all caching yourself.  you're already going to have to create some http requests though, and there'll be an additional latency because you'll have to create the websocket connection.
[13:46:37] <robertmaxrees> latency is a big problem for mobile.
[13:48:00] <momomo> bomb, you like it?
[13:48:00] <robertmaxrees> also: you won't get the benefits of pipelined requests unless you open multiple sockets at a time.
[13:48:14] <momomo> mm thats true
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> then you have to worry about processing each request as it returns, which becomes a serial, manual process.
[13:48:55] <robertmaxrees> and sockets don't support automatic unzipping, so you'd have to unszip in your js.
[13:48:55] <momomo> although I am unsure of wether the actual websocket requests are syncronous or the actual processing of the result taht is
[13:49:02] <robertmaxrees> the processing is
[13:49:07] <momomo> i don't think the websockets lock up waiting for an answer
[13:49:24] <momomo> robertmaxrees, no gzipping?
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> websockets don't current ungzip.
[13:49:38] <robertmaxrees> so your js would have to do it.
[13:49:41] <robertmaxrees> which is more latency.
[13:49:56] <decx> more payload for the runtime too ^^
[13:50:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> all of this is basically trying to solve problems browser vendors have already solved.
[13:50:36] <robertmaxrees> or are working really hard on.
[13:51:31] <momomo> mm .. i guess ... i just had this discussion with this guy on a party last time, where he said they did everything over websockets and i had deliberated it before, and i guess I am deliberating it now again
[13:51:35] <momomo> although i do hate bundling
[13:51:59] <robertmaxrees> don't get me wrong, i'd LOVE to see a POC with that concept, but there's a reason bundling is so ubiquitous.
[13:52:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not to say popularity == better, but it's a solid approach.
[13:52:40] <momomo> robertmaxrees, if anything bundling highlights the issues with multiple http requests  ...
[13:52:54] <momomo> although you also get increased gzipping performance
[13:52:56] <robertmaxrees> my company actually found the breaking point with bundling.
[13:52:59] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:53:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm speaking from experience here.
[13:53:11] <momomo> breaking point?
[13:53:25] <momomo> too much/too little ?
[13:53:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:53:35] <momomo> is that a number
[13:53:36] <momomo> 42?
[13:53:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't have the specifics in front of me.
[13:53:56] <momomo> you are actually serious?
[13:54:00] <momomo> there is a formula? :P
[13:54:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> not a formula, but we saw a definite breaking point with our customer base.
[13:54:31] <momomo> i mean, core libs should probably be one bundle ..
[13:54:40] <robertmaxrees> right. i just suggested that.
[13:54:41] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:54:49] <robertmaxrees> core libs in one and then your stuff that changes in another.
[13:56:44] <momomo> what kind of breaking point you talking about? like how often they would have to break their cache per week ? how would one keep track of that?
[13:57:07] <robertmaxrees> the size of the bundled assets relative to the number of assets themselves.
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> you realize that browsers break cache all the time, yeah?
[13:57:39] <robertmaxrees> and if you really care about the perf of asset loading, you'd also have a cdn.
[13:57:43] <robertmaxrees> since mobile is all about latency.
[13:58:21] <momomo> what would a cdn provide that my server could not? a cached dns request ?
[13:58:30] <momomo> or you thinking of jquery lib loading?
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> physical proximity.
[13:58:36] <momomo> ha
[13:58:37] <momomo> aha
[13:58:39] <robertmaxrees> no i mean a cdn for your static assets.
[13:58:46] <robertmaxrees> you laugh, but it's a relevant issu8e.
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> *issue
[13:59:04] <momomo> what are the best cdns out there?
[13:59:12] <momomo> are there good ones for free?
[13:59:19] <momomo> easy to upload api's?
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> tons of reading material on google for that one :)
[14:00:22] <robertmaxrees> hell we have an entire service dedicated to just images.
[14:00:26] <decx> btw robertmaxrees, do you do recommendations third party or with some inhouse machine learning mumbo jumbo solution
[14:00:39] <robertmaxrees> decx depends on which recs ;)
[14:00:50] <decx> let's say on a product page
[14:00:52] <decx> that's easiest ^^
[14:01:06] <robertmaxrees> the "people who bought this product also bought" type stuff is all third party.
[14:01:23] <decx> oh?
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> si.
[14:01:50] <robertmaxrees> lots of companies in that space.
[14:01:58] <decx> i wouldnth think there's an information gap with orders
[14:02:47] <robertmaxrees> we ship all the stats to them.
[14:03:00] <decx> grab couple of orders where this product was in and spit out a random sample
[14:03:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah basically.
[14:03:26] <robertmaxrees> they can also track users across sites so they can build profiles that we can't.
[14:03:32] <dysoco> I have the following table, and I'd like to get all the green buttons in there (the ones which name starts with 'carga'); I don't know a lot about jQuery but more or less I came up with something like this, tough it's not working: http://puu.sh/r4kTF/e43a6add45.PNG
[14:03:35] <decx> true
[14:03:48] <dysoco> can anyone point me to the correct way to select those buttons based on the name? or maybe based on the row since they're all in the same row?
[14:03:54] <decx> i'd think that was more for a landingpage style recomm. akin to targeted ads
[14:03:56] <dysoco> s/row/column
[14:03:56] <b-ot> Correction, <dysoco> can anyone point me to the correct way to select those buttons based on the name? or maybe based on the column since they're all in the same column?
[14:04:17] <robertmaxrees> dysoco i can't see your html - mind making a basic fiddle?
[14:04:42] <robertmaxrees> decx you can do that, too.
[14:04:59] <robertmaxrees> decx our provide supports all kinds of crazy stuff.  they can effectively power your site's search if you want them to.
[14:05:16] <dysoco> robertmaxrees, yeah that's the table http://hastebin.com/orekorufow.html
[14:05:20] <robertmaxrees> user-based autocomplete.
[14:05:27] <decx> yeah few of my clients in ecommerce have that as well
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> dysoco sorry, could you show rendered html instead?
[14:05:53] <dysoco> yeah right that makes sense
[14:06:00] <robertmaxrees> dysoco :) and acutally setup a jsfiddle :D
[14:06:32] <robertmaxrees> ah wait.
[14:06:35] <robertmaxrees> .find().find()
[14:06:51] <robertmaxrees> are you looking for the button whose name contains carga?
[14:07:17] <dysoco> yeah, all the buttons
[14:07:22] <robertmaxrees> .find('button[name*="carga"]')
[14:07:29] <robertmaxrees> .find() looks for all descendents.
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> you were looking for all children of button who have that in there.
[14:07:52] <dysoco> so
[14:08:01] <dysoco> var button = $(this).find("td").find('button[name*="carga"]') ?
[14:08:07] <robertmaxrees> something like that, yeah.
[14:08:09] <dysoco> or var button = $(this).find('button[name*="carga"]') ?
[14:08:39] <dysoco> oh there we go, I think the first one does it
[14:08:46] <robertmaxrees> either could work.  depends on if you want it to only be in the 'td'
[14:09:01] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - use a class for that instead of the name.
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> much easier to work with.
[14:09:18] <dysoco> oh it's the same really
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> similar.
[14:10:02] <dysoco> yeah this is all a dirty hack really... once I get done with the prototype I'll end up making everything nicer
[14:10:13] <dysoco> and uh... hopefully not using PHP either
[15:33:58] * taplar dances
[15:34:04] <robertmaxrees> same
[15:41:36] <Gnut> is there any difference between `$('#deploy_table input')` and `$('input', '#deploy_table')`
[15:42:10] <robertmaxrees> one uses jquery's .find() while the other relies strictly on sizzle, which will probably delegate down to the browser's methods
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> same result though.
[15:42:42] <Gnut> So i should probably stick with option 2
[15:42:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd use option 1.
[15:43:22] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, var $deployTable = $('#deploy_table'), $deployTableInput = $deployTable.find('input');
[15:44:55] <Gnut> robertmaxrees: cool, thanks!
[16:42:17] <flashpoint9> Im trying to check the value of an input text field but I suck at js
[16:42:17] <flashpoint9> http://paste.ofcode.org/32qxrM7mcCCMDy2AetQNntS
[16:42:30] <robertmaxrees> .val() returns a string.
[16:42:42] <flashpoint9> hmmm ok
[16:42:43] <flashpoint9> thanks
[16:42:45] <robertmaxrees> var quantity = parseInt($('#edit-quantity').val(), 10);
[16:42:49] <robertmaxrees> that's how you get your number.
[16:44:21] <flashpoint9> ah ok, I wrote it in a much less efficient way
[16:44:26] <flashpoint9> will refactor thanks1
[16:44:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:44:45] <robertmaxrees> how'd you write yours?
[16:54:26] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees:
[16:54:26] <flashpoint9> http://paste.ofcode.org/3aNTc4pqjQwmwxRap9Lyi8m
[16:54:53] <robertmaxrees> that's not more or less efficient.
[16:55:05] <flashpoint9> oh, it was more lines of code
[16:55:19] <robertmaxrees> # of lines != good or bad fwiw.
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/59065cdbdd46 this might be a little better for readability's sake.
[16:57:03] <flashpoint9> ah, so that code won't fire when a user types a number in that text field?
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> not magically...
[16:57:22] <robertmaxrees> gotta bind an event listener.
[16:57:34] <flashpoint9> ok, ill google it thanks

[20:12:44] <elter> i thought I could just do [{a:"b"},{c:"d"}] right?
[20:14:01] <taplar> yep
[20:14:22] <elter> how would I initliaze an emtpy array for objects?
[20:14:42] <taplar> I've seen some people do Array(#).fill()
[20:15:15] <taplar> but you really don't have to do that
[20:15:21] <taplar> you can push() to the array as you create them
[20:16:40] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/cfomLvuc/
[20:25:45] <Zeranoe> Is it possible to run .removeClass() and .css() on the same selector at the same time?
[20:26:22] <taplar> chained?  or literally at the same time?
[20:27:02] <Zeranoe> taplar: chained was the keyword, working now. Thanks for that little bit lol
[20:27:15] <taplar> :)
[22:48:11] <xdevnull> 24 hrs no one helped me :(
[22:54:10] <systemfault> Perhaps you don't pay enough... or your problem is difficult
[22:54:26] <systemfault> Or because the people who could help aren't online
[23:38:22] <xdevnull> systemfault, seems so, it's draggable droppable,switching from draggable to droppable and vice versa during execution
[23:38:23] <xdevnull> :P
[23:38:39] <xdevnull> enable/disable stuff .. kinda hard a bit
