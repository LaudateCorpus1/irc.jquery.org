[05:16:05] <Lebbe> yes it does
[05:16:20] <Lebbe> you can use .first()
[05:16:29] <FernandoBasso> I need to iterate over that list, and when it finishes, I need to go over and over again.
[05:16:38] <Lebbe> why
[05:16:43] <Lebbe> what are you doing with the list
[05:17:23] <Lebbe> list.each(function() { var $this = $(this); /* Do what you want with your elements here, they are in variable $this. */ });
[05:17:33] <FernandoBasso> I used that at first.

[05:21:01] <Lebbe> rowsSites[cont].find('dominio a') < wont work
[05:21:25] <Lebbe> a simple way is just wrap jquery around

[05:21:47] <Lebbe> $(rowsSites[cont]).find('dominio a') < work
[05:22:20] <Lebbe> but why are you trying to find a tag with name dominio? I sure haven't heard of that tag before
[05:22:51] <FernandoBasso> It was a mistake. It is .find('.dominio a');
[05:24:20] <FernandoBasso> Doesn't wrapping jQuery around rowsSites[cont] make it too heavy? (just asking)
[05:25:16] <Lebbe> not in this case it seems
[05:25:41] <FernandoBasso> Lebbe: All right. Thanks for all the help and time. It is most appreciated!

[06:47:59] <davlefou> hi,
[06:49:29] <davlefou> hi, i would like create an empty spuare who moving with my mouse. What i use for square?
[06:49:52] <xxx1337> Hey I have some jquery that isn't working as intended: On line 50 I try to get #country's value to store in a variable later
[06:49:57] <xxx1337> but it's coming up undefined: http://pastebin.com/updmdUqb
[06:51:25] <xxx1337> I want var countrythis to be filled with the value attribute of #country
[06:51:47] <xxx1337> so for example it could be a string "United States"
[06:51:55] <xxx1337> but it's instead undefined
[06:51:57] <xxx1337> not sure for what reason
[06:52:05] <xxx1337> my syntax looks right..
[06:55:10] <BillCriswell> davlefou: A div?
[06:58:14] <davlefou> BillCriswell, i made that : http://pastebin.com/8kcTYT0e
[06:58:25] <davlefou> but i not all good,
[07:01:04] <BillCriswell> davlefou: What's your goal? To move around a div?
[07:02:53] <davlefou> BillCriswell, my goal is to have en mobile block drag&drop like that http://demo.webform.com/form/13210
[07:03:58] <ciqsteve> Q: I'm trying to select on a class & data field.. like this:  $(".container [data-course-id='1234']")
[07:04:12] <ciqsteve> that returns empty list, but each individually does not
[07:04:20] <ciqsteve> and there is a container with that id
[07:04:27] <ciqsteve> is my syntax wrong?
[07:04:30] <BillCriswell> davlefou: I think this would be more what you're looking for: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[07:04:39] <ciqsteve>  $(".container [data-course-id='1234']")
[07:04:45] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: no space.
[07:04:50] <ciqsteve> BC tyvm
[07:05:07] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: . selects classes, # selects ids.
[07:05:31] <ciqsteve> right.. know that
[07:05:47] <BillCriswell> Are you looking for a <div class="container" data-course-id="1234"> ? or anything with a data-cource-id attribute in a .container?
[07:05:58] <ciqsteve> A)
[07:06:03] <ciqsteve> <div...
[07:06:30] <BillCriswell> ok then just no space.
[07:07:22] <ciqsteve> my (incorrect) assumption was that the [...] part was just a selector, along the lines of . and #
[07:07:45] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: It is. It's an attribute selector.
[07:08:06] <Fogest> I am making a input box bigger when a user clicks on it by changing the size attribute. Is it possible to animate this expansion?
[07:08:09] <ciqsteve> so why no space?  seems it would be consistent  as  .foo .bar works
[07:08:57] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: .foo .bar would only get bars inside .foo.
[07:09:22] <BillCriswell> .foo.bar would get class="foo bar" or class="bar foo" or even class="foo bar baz boo"
[07:09:34] <ciqsteve> ahh I see, and the attr isnt inside but inline
[07:09:45] <BillCriswell> Right.
[07:10:04] <ciqsteve> got it. thanks (and thanks for hanging here answering Q's.. you've helped me before.. appreciate it)
[07:10:11] <BillCriswell> Fogest: I think you'd need to animate the width? I'd have to try it out though.
[07:10:17] <BillCriswell> ciqsteve: No problem!
[07:11:48] <davlefou> BillCriswell, yes, how i do that?
[07:12:07] <BillCriswell> davlefou: jQuery UI. The docs and example and everything are in the link I sent.
[07:12:22] <BillCriswell> Fogest: http://jsbin.com/fuwifira/1/edit
[07:12:22] <decx> are you helping 3 people simultanously?
[07:13:32] <Fogest> BillCriswell: oh... so I don't even need jquery then...?
[07:13:45] <Fogest> BillCriswell: this is just CSS3 isn't it?
[07:14:03] <BillCriswell> Fogest: Yeah, depending on the browsers you need to support just the CSS hsould do the trick.
[07:14:15] <BillCriswell> Just make sure you add the right -vendor- crap for what you need to support.
[07:14:44] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/fuwifira/2/edit?js adjusting the size property didn't work as I suspected.
[07:14:50] <Fogest> BillCriswell: this is used internally only by a few people who use modern versions of either IE, Firefox, or Chrome, so I should be fine with CSS3. Thank you!
[07:15:02] <BillCriswell> Fogest: No problem.
[07:19:45] <svenvonarx> hey guys, i have a problem with jquery.width()
[07:19:55] <svenvonarx> the value changes within browser
[07:20:01] <svenvonarx> is there a possibility to fix this?
[07:20:45] <decx> what does that even mean
[07:21:26] <svenvonarx> the width value of an element changes between firefox and chrome
[07:21:31] <svenvonarx> it's not the same
[07:21:47] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: You you provide a demo?
[07:22:20] <svenvonarx> yeah here http://praxis.sven.cubelab.ch/
[07:22:24] <svenvonarx> i want a flexible navigation
[07:22:35] <svenvonarx> i want to calc the padding which is needed to fill out the nav space
[07:25:08] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: What about width: 16.6%; text-align: center; ?
[07:25:27] <svenvonarx> this is not sexy for the design ;)
[07:25:34] <svenvonarx> flexible padding is the sexiest way
[07:25:45] <svenvonarx> we can make it static without problem
[07:26:01] <svenvonarx> but if the client will change the nav structure, we have to change the css
[07:26:11] <dglambert> hey hey
[07:26:32] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: display: table-cell
[07:27:30] <svenvonarx> damn i did not think at this, i will try thx
[07:27:52] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[07:28:25] <BillCriswell> Android's Emulator is unbearable.
[07:28:28] <BillCriswell> I need a drink.
[07:33:57] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: http://jsbin.com/tuxihugo/1/edit here is what I came up with.
[07:34:17] <BillCriswell> because anything is better than trying to use this thing right now.
[07:35:23] <decx> emulating android seems pointless with the kind of differences there are not only between browsers, but android versions and even distributors
[07:36:00] <BillCriswell> decx: The emulation accounts for all that stuff as far as I can tell.
[07:36:14] <BillCriswell> It basically like installs an OS for you to test in.
[07:36:29] <decx> the developer chuckled to himself quietly when he wrote that in the docs
[07:36:47] <BillCriswell> and emulates the hardware setup, it's not just a simulator.
[07:36:51] <BillCriswell> decx: haha probably.
[07:36:57] <decx> i used it
[07:37:04] <BillCriswell> I'm not too familiar with that side of things. If it's not happening in a browser I'm clueless.
[07:37:24] <decx> but even between samsung and htc there are browserdifferences on the same version
[07:37:25] <svenvonarx> thx @BillCriswell
[07:38:07] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: No problem.
[07:38:37] <BillCriswell> decx: I can't find the bit slide thing that explained the differences between all the little android browser differences.
[07:38:49] <BillCriswell> decx: Pretty nightmare situation for front-end guys.
[07:39:09] <decx> you mean http://slides.com/html5test/the-android-browser
[07:39:50] <BillCriswell> That's the one.
[07:42:09] <BillCriswell> After reading that again I'm depressed.
[07:43:14] <decx> maybe this cheers you up. this morning somebody asked an obviously css question so i made this: http://i.imgur.com/wfpzHdV.gif
[07:44:25] <svenvonarx> Bill i tried it, but i does not work correctly, did i forgot something?
[07:44:26] <svenvonarx> http://praxis.sven.cubelab.ch/
[07:44:44] <BillCriswell> Did you recite Ezekiel 25:17/
[07:45:09] <decx> i got so lost in the lipsyncing the guy was gone when i had it uploaded
[07:45:37] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: The ul with table-row maybe?
[07:45:48] <BillCriswell> No tha wasn't it.
[07:45:50] <BillCriswell> Hmmm.
[07:45:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha
[07:46:10] <BillCriswell> decx: It's pretty damn good.
[07:46:43] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: You have width: 100% on the table cell.
[07:46:46] <svenvonarx> on the nav container -> table, ul -> table-row, li->table scell
[07:46:48] <svenvonarx> cell*
[07:47:10] <BillCriswell> on the li, which is styled to behave like a table-cell*
[07:47:36] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: Those <li>s should not be floating either.
[07:48:18] <Es0teric> what is the difference between .live() and .on()?
[07:48:36] <svenvonarx> i removed the float on the li
[07:48:40] <decx> live is like disco and on is like dubstep
[07:49:04] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm switching to live().
[07:49:12] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: Also the width.
[07:49:19] <BillCriswell> You have width 100% on them.
[07:49:22] <decx> ha ha ha ha , staying at live() staying at live()
[07:49:27] <svenvonarx> should i set it to auto?
[07:49:38] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: Yes. I think that would fix it.
[07:49:43] <svenvonarx> nope :S
[07:49:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Nailed it.
[07:50:21] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: I refreshed it and it appears to be working like a table now.
[07:51:04] <svenvonarx> yeah but not the fullwidth
[07:52:50] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: There's not enough space for all those items.
[07:53:27] <svenvonarx> Oo why?
[07:55:30] <BillCriswell> svenvonarx: http://jsbin.com/tuxihugo/2/edit
[07:56:11] <BillCriswell> No spaces or larger text like that. Not sure where else you'd like the text to go haha
[07:57:32] <svenvonarx> hmm
[07:57:51] <svenvonarx> it's strange
[07:57:52] <svenvonarx> :D
[07:58:24] <svenvonarx> because it worked also with item 1, item 2 and so on
[08:01:05] <Es0teric> decx: thanks for that analogy lol because this works now
[08:02:45] <svenvonarx> daaaaaamn
[08:02:48] <svenvonarx> i solved it
[08:02:56] <svenvonarx> there was another float on table row
[08:03:02] <BillCriswell> sweet
[08:03:29] <svenvonarx> thanks for your help ;)
[08:07:35] <phoenixsun> if one jQuery versions is loaded does the browser resist later calls to load another version within the same page
[08:08:01] <phoenixsun> I am basically considering conditional jQuery loading to deal with IE
[08:14:51] <dglambert> is it possible to use not in jquery selectors?
[08:16:22] <drej> yup
[08:19:46] <BillCriswell> dglambert: :not in an actual selector, or you can filter them out using $('.foo').not('.bar')
[08:20:03] <dglambert> oh ok
[08:20:13] <dglambert> my current selector
[08:20:14] <dglambert> $('.modal-body a').on('click',
[08:20:35] <dglambert> But I want to filter out a with href that contains mailto
[08:21:13] <nagrat> cpi;dm
[08:21:23] <NoiseEee> dglambert: so just sniff it out in the callback and return appropriately
[08:21:37] <NoiseEee> dglambert: the event and the element it happened on are readily available
[08:21:39] <BillCriswell> a:not([href^=mailto])
[08:22:44] <BillCriswell> in the callback you can do if (this.protocol !== 'mailto:') {}, your call.
[08:23:11] <BillCriswell> I spelled protocol right, whoa.
[08:23:20] <jphase> lol
[08:23:47] <jphase> that can be a tough one before noon
[08:24:06] <BillCriswell> That and propagation.
[08:24:25] <BillCriswell> Always want to type propogation for some reason.
[08:24:51] <xxx1337> Is it possible to change a html tag to become a different html tag with jquery?
[08:25:47] <jphase> xxx1337, I assume you don't literally mean the <html> tag, but a tag in general?
[08:25:55] <xxx1337> yea a tag in general
[08:26:25] <xxx1337> jphase:
[08:26:46] <jphase> you'd probably want to store the DOM object into a variable, modify the containing tag, and insert it back into the DOM while removing the other
[08:26:54] <jphase> sounds kinda ghetto though heh
[08:27:14] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I can't imagine a case where I'd need to do that.
[08:31:57] <dglambert> sorry zoned out to another problem
[08:33:02] <BillCriswell> Damn, just came across a random mention of css ::outside selector. I think I'd like that.
[08:33:38] <BillCriswell> Well, psuedo element, not selector.
[08:36:31] <systemfault> BillCriswell: What is that? Like ::before/::after but outside of its container? (It wraps it?)
[08:36:39] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Yes.
[08:36:52] <BillCriswell> It was mentioned in like 03 haha
[08:36:53] <systemfault> I can see that being useful
[08:38:04] <BillCriswell> I agree.
[08:38:21] <BillCriswell> @media (max-width: 500px){ table::outside { overflow: auto; } }
[08:38:49] <BillCriswell> Er, overflow-scroll: auto;
[08:38:51] <BillCriswell> I think?
[08:39:07] <BillCriswell> Basically when the table it too wide make it scrollable horizontally without JS.
[08:43:54] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[08:45:30] <BillCriswell> arthurvr: ayyy
[08:51:15] <hlvwrk> heyyy billleh!
[08:51:29] <hlvwrk> can you halp me simplify this code?
[08:51:44] <arthurvr> what code?
[08:51:46] <hlvwrk> it works as expected, but dirty.
[08:51:47] <hlvwrk> http://jsfiddle.net/75gRR/3/
[08:54:24] <arthurvr> This one uses regular expression for string manipulation instead of arrays : http://jsfiddle.net/75gRR/4/
[08:54:53] <hlvwrk> ah, that's actually better.
[08:55:39] <arthurvr> Caching selectors is a best practice too :  http://jsfiddle.net/75gRR/5/
[08:56:01] <arthurvr> oops double variable name
[08:56:23] <arthurvr> this one is better : http://jsfiddle.net/75gRR/6/
[08:56:53] <hlvwrk> Thank you!
[08:56:56] <hlvwrk> that works great.
[09:06:33] <phoenixsun> is browserstack any good? I am trying it out and a page loads within it on IE9 but in on real life IE9 system it doesnt load
[09:07:19] <robertmaxrees> i just use local VMs these days
[09:07:42] <arthurvr> I use browserstack all the time, no problems with it
[09:07:45] <BillCriswell> systemfault: You know what even be more useful than out ::outside? an ::inside
[09:07:57] <arthurvr> It are technically vm’s, but just streamed over the internet
[09:08:51] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  didn't know that.
[09:10:35] <phoenixsun> ok well I will do more testing and see. But atm the results seems inconsistent with an actual on VM IE
[09:10:43] <phoenixsun> on = non
[09:10:58] <edrahn> I have a div that is show after you click a link, how do I hide() it if you click anywere but the div?
[09:12:54] <BillCriswell> edrahn: You can put an event listener on the document then when it bubbles up check to see if the element it originated from is the element you're talking about or the child of it.
[09:13:20] <arthurvr> $(document).not(”div”) ??
[09:13:51] <robertmaxrees> the event.target is what he wants.
[09:14:15] <BillCriswell> I think... $(document).on('click', function(e){ if( $(e.target).closest('#modal').length === 0 ) { /* They didn't click anything inside of it */  } });
[09:14:21] <systemfault> BillCriswell: That’s what ::before and ::after are, no?
[09:15:15] <BillCriswell> systemfault: I was thinking like .foo::outer > <::outer><div class="foo"></div></::outer> and .foo::inside > <div class="foo"><::inside>...</::inside></div>
[09:15:50] <systemfault> Ahhh
[09:15:50] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Like .wrap() and .wrapInner() basically.
[09:16:03] <systemfault> BillCriswell: Yeah, ::inside would wrap the actual content
[09:16:14] <BillCriswell> Wonder why that never took off.
[09:16:41] <BillCriswell> I'd like to not use .container elements to put paddings on things freely with content-box
[09:17:08] <BillCriswell> It would be nice to not have to create .container's in general.
[09:37:58] <jeremyabel> hey folks. I'm getting a TypeError when I attempt to trigger an event with .trigger, "type.indexOf is not a function", on line 4527 of jquery.js v2.0.3
[09:38:06] <jeremyabel> in firefox
[09:38:14] <jeremyabel> version 31.0
[09:38:22] <robertmaxrees> can you show your code?
[09:38:26] <jeremyabel> yeah one sec
[09:38:50] <jeremyabel> http://paste.pm/igk.js
[09:38:54] <jeremyabel> the trigger is on line 33
[09:39:40] <jeremyabel> according to the firefox debugger, after that call it trundles through normal jquery event triggering stuff and dies when it gets to "if ( type.indexOf(".") >= 0 ) {" in the .trigger function def
[09:40:26] <robertmaxrees> and you tried to console.log(this.$html) right before that and get what you expected, yeah?
[09:40:35] <jeremyabel> nope lemme try that
[09:41:06] <jeremyabel> yeah, I got what I expected
[09:41:16] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[09:41:53] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Creating CSS in JS... think that's evil?
[09:41:54] <jeremyabel> only in firefox though. The thing that happens immediately before this is that I have a video tag with two sources, one mp4 and one ogv
[09:42:17] <jeremyabel> it fails trying to load the mp4 of course, then throws that error
[09:42:18] <robertmaxrees> jeremyabel http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15653917/jquery-1-9-1-event-handle-apply-alternative ?
[09:42:21] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[09:42:30] <jeremyabel> but the code is unrelated, the HTMLPreloader thing doesn't preload videos
[09:42:34] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell eeehhhh... generally i'd say "nooooooo"
[09:43:07] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern.  but you always have neat use cases - got something special?
[09:43:19] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I wrote a little plugin, and I'm feeling like it's my best option... but I can't tell. It's either that of inline styles.
[09:43:32] <BillCriswell> that or inline styles*
[09:43:42] <robertmaxrees> what about just requiring a stylesheet?
[09:43:50] <BillCriswell> The css changes a lot.
[09:43:56] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[09:44:29] <BillCriswell> I've dubbed it poor man's masonry.
[09:47:34] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://crswll.com/widget/
[09:50:39] <jeremyabel> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13595 does this page load for anybody?
[09:51:08] <Jattenalle> i'm streaming today again, not sure if anyone tuned in yesterday, but if you're curious about my bad code you can see it happen live here http://www.hitbox.tv/apistudios
[09:51:15] <robertmaxrees> jeremyabel the bugtracker has been really terrible lately.
[09:51:20] <jeremyabel> guhhhhhh
[09:51:20] <arthurvr> jeremyabel: it does for me
[09:51:47] <jeremyabel> arthurvr: could you pastebin it for me?
[09:51:57] <jeremyabel> oh there it goes
[09:51:58] <jeremyabel> nvm
[09:52:07] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/10/ it is driving me crazy css positioning
[09:52:31] <arthurvr> The bugtracker is terrible last time
[09:52:43] <robertmaxrees> it needs an update badly.
[09:53:44] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: There indeed need to be an update.
[09:54:04] <jeremyabel> goddammit... "The error is being thrown from within the dataTables plugin. Please contact them."
[09:54:06] <robertmaxrees> they're looking for somebody to do it.
[09:54:18] <jeremyabel> thanks bug, for being sorta but totally unrelated to my case...
[09:54:28] <arthurvr> I would be cool if they just use github issues.
[09:54:38] <robertmaxrees> they don't want to make the migration quite yet.
[09:54:42] <jeremyabel> are they using some custom thinger?
[09:55:07] <robertmaxrees> nope, trac
[09:56:18] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: What's going on here?
[09:56:33] <jeremyabel> god wtf is up with this error though. all my parameters are valid, it works in chrome...
[09:56:53] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, working on my game, the UI is html/jquery which is what i'm doing right now
[09:57:05] <jop008> This works fine but not when you resize the window
[09:57:14] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, it's the same stuff you went over a month or three ago, when you told me about .val() ;)
[09:57:18] <jop008> I have a book on CSS and read it
[09:57:43] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: Nice. So this just kind of streams you coding.
[09:57:52] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, yup
[09:58:12] <BillCriswell> Never heard of hitbox.
[09:58:16] <robertmaxrees> jop008 you'll probably have better luck in #css
[09:58:42] <jop008> thanks but css and jqmobile is not that different
[09:58:59] <jop008> there they will send me back to this channel
[09:59:02] <robertmaxrees> your question is css specific - you'll have more luck in the channel dedicated to css.
[09:59:07] <robertmaxrees> nah, they're pretty cool over there.
[09:59:57] <robertmaxrees> they can take a little bit of time to respond, but it doesn't hurt to ask the experts :)
[10:01:32] <Jattenalle> BillCriswell, never used 'em before.. but given twitch.tv's late silliness now's a good a time as any
[10:03:55] <xxx1337> Can someone get this working (read the only comment)? http://jsfiddle.net/hph1tftc/
[10:04:30] <xxx1337> i lied there are more than 1 comments but not anymore http://jsfiddle.net/hph1tftc/1/
[10:08:04] <jop008> no help there
[10:08:31] <BillCriswell> jop008: You're not giving enough information.
[10:08:43] <jop008> see my http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/11/
[10:08:52] <jop008> how to get it in one row
[10:09:02] <jop008> and postion to the right
[10:09:09] <jop008> what info do you need?
[10:09:17] <NoiseEee> xxx1337: http://jsfiddle.net/hph1tftc/2/ ?
[10:09:41] <robertmaxrees> jop008 btw // isn't a valid comment in CSS.
[10:09:43] <NoiseEee> xxx1337: ie: why were you creating a second listener/function?
[10:10:53] <BillCriswell> jop008: Look at the styles applied to the element before and after you hit that width and adjust from there. There's a media query in there.
[10:10:55] <jop008> but it won't do harm
[10:11:09] <robertmaxrees> jop008 actually, it can.  invalid code is never a good thing.
[10:11:13] <jop008> I have done that do with inspect element
[10:12:28] <jop008> but what to use float:right?
[10:13:00] <jop008> changed no difference of course
[10:13:31] <robertmaxrees> jop008 you want the toggle on the same line as the label?
[10:13:53] <jop008>     float:right;    margin:0;    padding:0;    width:20em;
[10:14:03] <jop008> why the width must be so large?
[10:14:15] <jop008> yes on the same line and to the right
[10:14:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/12/
[10:15:36] <robertmaxrees> if you don't want to next the selct under the label, set the select and label to display: inline; and/or use floats.
[10:15:48] <robertmaxrees> *nested under the label in the markup, I mean.
[10:17:47] <jop008> not on one line
[10:17:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:18:11] <jop008> I have label and on the other line the flip switch
[10:18:33] <jop008> looking at fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/12/
[10:18:46] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/sobcuab.png is what i see.
[10:19:03] <robertmaxrees> if the page is wide enough it looks like that breaks.
[10:19:12] <jop008> what browser?
[10:19:18] <jop008> I looked with seamonkey
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> all of them.
[10:19:32] <robertmaxrees> if you're using jqmobile, use browser emulation.
[10:19:39] <jop008> on chrome also on 2 rows
[10:20:00] <jop008> I develop always with chrome and works fine
[10:20:15] <robertmaxrees> i see it one one line in chrome if i'm at the correct width.
[10:20:20] <jop008> my sceen is wid 23 inch
[10:21:04] <robertmaxrees> you're using jqmobile - i assume this is for a mobile device.  is that correct?
[10:21:17] <jop008> multipe
[10:21:22] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:21:24] <jop008> also usage ondesktop
[10:21:35] <robertmaxrees> don't use jqmobile for desktop.
[10:21:42] <jeremyabel> robertmaxrees: welp, problem solved by passing in a callback function, rather than triggering an event :P
[10:21:44] <jop008> write once run on multiple that's my motto
[10:22:17] <robertmaxrees> jeremyabel interesting.
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> wonder why.
[10:22:37] <robertmaxrees> jop008 try putting that code in context of your page and test there.
[10:22:55] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: jqmobile is like full on responsive nowadays: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/
[10:23:20] <robertmaxrees> eh, i'm still personally not a fan of using it for desktop, but that's me.
[10:23:26] <jop008> I tested for an hour of 6
[10:23:27] <robertmaxrees> i know the branding.
[10:23:35] <jeremyabel> robertmaxrees: yeah, I saw what it was doing though. In chrome it was passing the name of the event into that type variable, as a string, which obviously works for .indexOf
[10:23:40] <robertmaxrees> jop008 you tested what I gave you for an hour?
[10:23:44] <jop008> I am running 1.4.3
[10:23:45] <robertmaxrees> jeremyabel aaaaaah.
[10:23:47] <jeremyabel> but in firefox, it was passing the ENTIRE event object
[10:23:52] <jeremyabel> which obviously you can't run .indexOf on
[10:23:53] <jop008> an hour?
[10:24:15] <jop008> this link http://jsfiddle.net/Lqy86dc6/12/
[10:24:45] * jeremyabel closes like 50 browser tabs
[10:24:57] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yeah. It seems like a lot of work to get some controls aligned to the right. There must be something in the API for that.
[10:25:19] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell i got it to work if I sized my browser to roughly that of a mobile device.
[10:25:30] <drej> people are still using jquery mobile?
[10:25:48] <robertmaxrees> but if we're talking full-on responsive, i'd need more context than what we've got.
[10:25:58] <robertmaxrees> jqm is a popular option these days.
[10:26:19] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I was thinking he just wanted to align all the way to the right no matter what.
[10:26:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.  with more code context it'd be easier imo.
[10:26:58] <kpap> but should try hexchat and see if that work
[10:27:54] <BillCriswell> I love the documentation for it. Little code popups.
[10:28:53] <BillCriswell> jop008: http://jsfiddle.net/tw16/ry799/1/ found this on SO. Might be useful in your adventure!
[10:29:20] <BillCriswell> Maybe.
[10:30:45] <rajlaksh> my this code does not work of Jquery tooltip
[10:30:47] <rajlaksh> $('.series_preview').tooltip({showURL:false,track:true,fade:250,delay:0,extraClass:"preview",bodyHandler:function(){
[10:32:30] <jop008> Igoogled for hours I found that example too
[10:32:33] <jop008> but no way
[10:33:38] <robertmaxrees> jop008 is it possible for you to show us more of what you're working with?  sounds like there may be an issue with the page.
[10:33:43] <in_deep_thought> I get Uncaught Reference Error: $ is not defined. On this line: $(function() {  . This sounds like jquery isn’t importing correctly right?
[10:33:53] <robertmaxrees> in_deep_thought yep - is jquery included before your code?
[10:34:01] <jop008> The rest of the page is fine
[10:34:03] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh can you setip a fiddle showing us?
[10:34:14] <rajlaksh> okay i try to
[10:34:22] <jop008> pastebin of the code
[10:34:25] <dmsuperman> in_deep_thought: your code is being called before you included jquery. it needs to be after
[10:34:39] <dmsuperman> in_deep_thought: generally I include jquery in the <head>, then all other JS goes at the bottom of <body>
[10:34:42] <dmsuperman> just above </body>
[10:34:57] <robertmaxrees> jop008 a fiddle or bin would be nicer imo.
[10:35:05] <rajlaksh> But its sending ajax request
[10:35:06] <jop008> http://pastebin.com/GUvNfjEe
[10:35:08] <jop008> code
[10:35:17] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh can you show us without the ajax part?

[10:37:36] <in_deep_thought> if I have angular and jquery script tags, which one should go first? It shouldn’t matter right? because neither one uses the other?

[10:38:36] <walidvb_> hi guys, i'm trying to see if smth that replicates the navigation between Safari 'shared links' view
[10:39:05] <walidvb_> where the scrolling/dragging has some resistance, as in you need to insist so as to scroll further down
[10:39:19] <walidvb_> exists* :D
[10:43:18] <dmsuperman> in_deep_thought: right, doesn't matter. all you want to do is ensure the code that you have that _relies_ on either of them comes after
[10:48:39] <robertmaxrees> jop my guess is you want something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/m6m2bdty/1/
[10:48:44] <robertmaxrees> not perfect, but the idea is about right.
[10:50:02] <robertmaxrees> jop008 rather
[10:50:25] <Jon30> is there a decent month picker plugin? I could find a full date picker and timepicker, but all month  pickers i found were crappy. KendoUI's looks very nice but it costs $$.
[10:50:55] <robertmaxrees> jqui has a builtin one if you have that included already
[10:50:57] <BillCriswell> Jon30: Just  a month picker? How about a select?
[10:50:59] <jop008> rather?
[10:51:10] <robertmaxrees> jop008 did you see the link I pasted?
[10:51:20] <Jon30> BillCriswell - I mean..  Month / Year.. no Day
[10:51:59] <BillCriswell> Jon30: What would that look like?
[10:52:31] <Jon30> BillCriswell: http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/datepicker/index
[10:52:34] <Jon30> click on the 2nd date
[10:53:17] <BillCriswell> Sheesh that's intense.
[10:53:28] <in_deep_thought> I am getting Uncaught Type Error: undefined is not a function on this line: $('.ob-button').button(); does this mean that .button() is undefined? Is .button() a built in jquery method, or is something wrong with my code in particular? Or maybe Im still not importing jquery correctly. though now it has no problem with $’s
[10:53:52] <robertmaxrees> .button() is not a jquery method.  looks like you want jquery ui maybe?
[10:54:19] <rajlaksh> JsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Branden/mzn86s01/
[10:54:25] <in_deep_thought> robertmaxrees: is that another library similar to jquery?
[10:54:58] <robertmaxrees> in_deep_thought it's made by the same group - it complements jquery.  you'd need both.
[10:55:42] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh you can reference external plugins in jsfiddle btw.
[10:55:59] <robertmaxrees> which plugin is this?
[10:56:29] <BillCriswell> Jon30: This is the first year/month only date picker I've seen.
[10:56:44] <Jon30> BillCriswell: i've seen others but they don't work
[10:57:15] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh also you have invalid code going on.
[10:57:24] <rajlaksh> Jquery Tooltip
[10:57:44] <robertmaxrees> which one?  there are tons.  can you link me to the repo?
[10:59:02] <rajlaksh> There was 1 } was left added http://jsfiddle.net/Branden/mzn86s01/1/
[11:00:41] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh also you want onDomReady, not in head for that dropdown/
[11:01:59] <rajlaksh> This is working http://jsfiddle.net/mzn86s01/3/
[11:02:39] <jftf> What's the hip thing to pull in 'partials' of js code so i can modularize my code?
[11:02:57] <jop008> wrong fiddle not for me

[11:03:59] <jop008> but wrong positioning on that page too
[11:04:22] <robertmaxrees> jop008 wat.  that's the description you gave - on one line and on the right.
[11:04:42] <jop008> algined to the right
[11:04:53] <jop008> and not somewhere to the right
[11:05:09] <jop008> it is not on one row either
[11:05:14] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/sh0GTu4.png so where should it be.
[11:05:32] <jop008> tot the right on one row
[11:05:41] <jop008> and label readable
[11:05:57] <robertmaxrees> jop008 that screenshot is exactly that.  clarify please.
[11:05:59] <jop008> autocomplete must be there and right to it the mini slder
[11:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry, i can't figure out what you want.  good luck!
[11:06:54] <jop008> see here http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-08_at_20.06.05-me3itzmw.png
[11:07:09] <jop008> not ot the right and not on one row
[11:07:14] <ezio> i have a Object {alnumStringEmpty: "The input is an empty string", stringLengthTooShort: "The input is less than 6 characters long"} ... i keep trying to $(data.messages).each(function() { //this = the same object
[11:07:20] <ezio> anyone know why that would be
[11:07:34] <ezio> oh
[11:07:36] <ezio> i think i know
[11:07:51] <BillCriswell> ezio: THink you want $.each(data.messages, function() {...});
[11:08:00] <robertmaxrees> or a normal for in loop./
[11:08:01] <BillCriswell> Even better if you just used a loop.
[11:08:03] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[11:08:21] <robertmaxrees> jop008 okay - did you look at the css changes I made?  those should help you figure out what to do next.
[11:09:02] <masu> anyone here who have used jquery-ui for effects, know how to overcome a problem where the elements have a reset float:initial set on them
[11:09:04] <jop008> I will take them over
[11:09:12] <masu> they dont shake
[11:09:30] <jop008> but why it is not looking as expected at my site?
[11:09:38] <robertmaxrees> jop008 because the css needs more tweaking.
[11:09:47] <robertmaxrees> open up your dev tools and get to playing around.
[11:09:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:09:57] <jop008> more very time consuming css
[11:10:12] <jop008> I had that kind of results already myself
[11:10:18] <jop008> but not 100%
[11:10:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what you're expecting from us at this point.
[11:11:26] <jop008> that css I had alerady before
[11:11:39] <rajlaksh> but its not working in localhost
[11:12:01] <rajlaksh> somehow its started to work in jsfiddle
[11:12:19] <jop008> a disadvantage taht you must put css stuff good but what about database content stuff
[11:12:22] <ezio> thanks that helped
[11:12:35] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh make sure you've got your js in a document ready.
[11:12:40] <jop008> like a translateion of the word autocomplete in germen will this fit also?
[11:12:52] <robertmaxrees> jop008 huh?
[11:13:00] <jop008> english
[11:13:03] <rajlaksh> Its loading correctly
[11:13:12] <rajlaksh> in console
[11:13:21] <rajlaksh> JS files
[11:13:35] <jop008> i18n stuf with lavels and label width in css
[11:15:50] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/m6m2bdty/3/ this is the right one
[11:16:00] <rajlaksh> Yeah
[11:16:01] <jop008> but I don't understand the label width
[11:16:10] <jop008> why must it be so large?
[11:16:19] <rajlaksh> maybe Jquery version is the problem
[11:16:34] <rajlaksh> in my case
[11:16:38] <jop008> and what about other strings like i18n strings translated by DB code
[11:16:52] <robertmaxrees> jop008 sounds like you need to setup internationalization and research how to do that.
[11:16:53] <jop008> will it be not readable if string gets longer?
[11:17:00] <jop008> I did already
[11:17:08] <rajlaksh> i grabbed source JS of JSfiddle its worked
[11:17:14] <jop008> databse driven
[11:17:19] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh what are you trying to do?
[11:17:23] <jop008> database will translate
[11:17:38] <rajlaksh> Its Working with Jquery 1.6.4
[11:17:47] <jop008> making a good application with strong depending on DB settings strings and code
[11:17:59] <jop008> but can you explain the width?
[11:18:15] <jop008> of the label
[11:18:46] <robertmaxrees> the width that was applied before was your issue.  you could text-align right that content and hack in a solution that way.
[11:18:49] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be too bad.
[11:18:54] <jop008> A short string with a wdith of 55%
[11:19:13] <robertmaxrees> jop008 i didn't say it was a perfect solution - was trying to give you a starting point.,
[11:19:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to it all for you.
[11:19:33] <robertmaxrees> *to do it all for you, i mean.
[11:19:34] <jop008> but I like to understand what I see
[11:19:42] <jop008> what is the width about?
[11:19:46] <robertmaxrees> i just told you.
[11:19:59] <jop008> SOmetimes people dont understand some things
[11:20:18] <jop008> so why must it be 55%
[11:20:20] <robertmaxrees> the width of that element was too narrow when you floated that other element into place.  that's all.
[11:20:28] <jop008> afor such a smalll label
[11:20:42] <robertmaxrees> because 55% happened to accomodate the size of the text.  it's not a perfect solution,  play around and find one that works for you :)
[11:20:43] <jop008> but 55% of my screen?
[11:20:52] <robertmaxrees> it's not 55% of your screen.
[11:21:02] <jop008> css is like gambling to me
[11:21:17] <jop008> hard to figure out why
[11:21:22] <jop008> magic
[11:21:23] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it - you should go read some tutorials and head over to #css to learn about it.
[11:21:33] <jop008> I read books on css
[11:21:39] <jop008> and lot of docu
[11:21:47] <jop008> but still the same feeling
[11:21:52] <robertmaxrees> it's an ongoing process.
[11:21:57] <robertmaxrees> you learn through doing stuff.
[11:22:03] <jop008> for more than 10 years?
[11:22:12] <jop008> so long working with css
[11:22:34] <robertmaxrees> i've been working with it for less time and don't seem to be having as many issues.  i don't know what you want from us.
[11:22:43] <jop008> so text-align is better
[11:22:45] <rajlaksh> This is code http://jsfiddle.net/Branden/mzn86s01/6/
[11:22:52] <rajlaksh> that is working
[11:23:15] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[11:23:19] <jop008> some help to get further and try to understand what I am doing not being a monkey and gambling
[11:23:32] <robertmaxrees> jop008 then head over to #css and learn :)
[11:23:53] <jop008> nothing there but silence
[11:23:57] <jop008> not very helpful
[11:24:00] <jop008> nice evening
[11:24:19] <robertmaxrees> they respond when they can as quickly as they can.
[11:26:59] <rajlaksh> Thanks
[11:27:45] <rajlaksh> after just adding //<![CDATA[ and //]]>  started working :)
[11:28:14] <robertmaxrees> rajlaksh i have no idea what's going on at this point hahaha
[11:28:43] <rajlaksh> But after adding that Its started working Hahahaa
[11:28:52] <rajlaksh> hahaahha
[11:28:57] <robertmaxrees> also - that's an awfully old version of jquery
[11:29:09] <rajlaksh> Nope
[11:29:16] <robertmaxrees> 1.6.4?!  yeah
[11:29:28] <rajlaksh> Its full code of How Tooltip works
[11:29:31] <rajlaksh> Yes
[11:30:30] <robertmaxrees> 1.6.4 is a very old version of jquery.  we're on 1.11.1 now.
[11:30:42] <rajlaksh> I'm using 1.1.10
[11:30:49] <robertmaxrees> 1.1.10 is SUPER old.
[11:30:59] <rajlaksh> nope
[11:31:02] <robertmaxrees> yes
[11:31:19] <BillCriswell> lol
[11:31:20] <rajlaksh> let me check
[11:31:37] <robertmaxrees> apparently a mod doesn't know anything about jquery versions ;)
[11:31:57] <robertmaxrees> http://blog.jquery.com/2007/01/14/jquery-birthday-11-new-site-new-docs/ -> "Posted on January 14, 2007 by John Resig"
[11:32:37] <BillCriswell> Man, he's been doing awesome stuff since before I was brave enough to go inside a <script> tag.
[11:32:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah he has been.
[11:33:11] <rajlaksh> is latest version support $.browser
[11:33:20] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.jquery
[11:33:31] <robertmaxrees> that'll tell you the version number.
[11:33:38] <robertmaxrees> 1.9 dropped $.browser support
[11:33:54] <rajlaksh> latest version does?
[11:34:01] <robertmaxrees> it does not have $.browser
[11:34:07] <rajlaksh> :(
[11:34:12] <robertmaxrees> browser detection is a bad idea.
[11:34:23] <robertmaxrees> iirc the migrate plugin puts it back in.
[11:36:54] <rajlaksh> okay thanks
[11:41:25] <Swappticon> Is the only main difference between jquery 1.0 and 2.0 that 2.0 doesn's support early IE browsers?
[11:41:39] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:41:54] <robertmaxrees> the 2.x series doesn't support IE 6, 7, and 8
[11:42:06] <robertmaxrees> detailed here: http://jquery.com/download/
[11:42:25] <Swappticon> Ok, cool. That was the only difference I could find and wanted to make sure. Thanks!
[11:42:45] <BillCriswell> Also a slight file size difference... which is nice.
[11:42:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:43:11] <BillCriswell> Full web 2.0 support
[11:45:25] <robertmaxrees> 95.821 kb vs 84.28 kb
[11:45:45] <BillCriswell> I lost about that much weight this past month.
[11:45:47] <robertmaxrees> wonder how much smaller if they got rid of all the patches for webkit.
[11:46:41] <BillCriswell> Wonder how much smaller I could get if I removed all the pizza.
[11:46:48] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[11:48:42] <BillCriswell> A browserstack for email clients... could you imagine the carnage?
[11:48:50] <robertmaxrees> NO.  DON'T SAY THAT.
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> now that you've said it, somebody will make it happen/
[11:50:56] <BillCriswell> I hope html email gets better one day.
[11:51:30] <robertmaxrees> it slowly is.
[11:57:10] <BillCriswell> I haven't been to warped tour since I was like 17 and they're sending me emails today for some reason.
[11:57:32] <robertmaxrees> every year I hear they're doing it again I think "that's still going on?"
[11:57:55] <BillCriswell> I knew maybe 3 bands, and all of them were probably there when I was 17 haha
[11:58:50] <BillCriswell> Saves The Day is the only one coming to mind now, though.
[12:00:18] <BillCriswell> The world would suck without wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Warped_Tour_lineups_by_year
[12:05:10] <METEMEDO> mother of god
[12:05:35] <BillCriswell> Hell of a table.
[12:07:16] <METEMEDO> http://pastebin.com/GqWBTys8 <- how can this be???
[12:08:13] <BillCriswell> METEMEDO: Your selector didn't find anything.
[12:08:25] <METEMEDO> it did
[12:08:29] <robertmaxrees> that should return a jquery object still.
[12:08:37] <robertmaxrees> can you share more code?
[12:08:49] <METEMEDO> if i type in console -> templates
[12:08:54] <METEMEDO> it prints the object
[12:09:22] <BillCriswell> Sounds like it might be running later than you think.
[12:09:52] <robertmaxrees> or it's a scoping issue.
[12:10:48] <METEMEDO> im calling the function right after its declaration\
[12:11:01] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[12:11:33] <snover> METEMEDO: since your code paste doesn’t even show where or how you are invoking that function, it is impossible for anyone to tell you what you are doing wrong
[12:11:44] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/xatukuwo/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:12:25] <BillCriswell> With the exact code you posted it works. There's more to it.
[12:12:36] <BillCriswell> Unless $ isn't what you think it is.
[12:13:35] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/xatukuwo/3/ here is your exact usage.
[12:15:27] <Jon30> is there a decent month picker plugin? I could find a full date picker and timepicker, but all month  pickers i found were crappy. KendoUI's looks very nice but it costs $$.
[12:16:15] <snover> Jon30: did you look at dojo?
[12:17:54] <Jon30> snover: just checked.. no month picker
[12:21:31] <snover> Jon30: http://archive.dojotoolkit.org/nightly/dojotoolkit/dojox/widget/tests/test_Calendar.html at the top-right.
[12:22:00] <Jon30> nice.. too bad it's dojo.. cause my project is already using jquery D:
[12:22:27] <snover> jquery is a dom library, dojo is an application toolkit, they are not mutually exclusive
[12:23:29] <snover> http://archive.dojotoolkit.org/nightly/dojotoolkit/dojox/widget/tests/test_CalendarViews.html another month-only one here
[12:23:34] <robertmaxrees> importing all of dojo for just the monthpicker seems like a little much imo.
[12:23:45] <robertmaxrees> Jon30 why not build your own?
[12:24:05] <Jon30> robertmaxrees: why waste time on something that already exists?
[12:24:19] <robertmaxrees> because apparently it doesn't ;)
[12:24:33] <BillCriswell> Why not two <selects>?
[12:24:43] <BillCriswell> or a select and an input?
[12:26:53] <METEMEDO> BillCriswell robertmaxrees snover thanks for the interest guys, but i sorted it out... it was just a pubic hair breaking my code
[12:27:00] <robertmaxrees> wat
[12:27:02] <robertmaxrees> kay
[12:27:27] <BillCriswell> all right.
[12:27:31] <snover> robertmaxrees: sure, writing an app, it’s a better idea to start with dojo, but if you didn’t, you can still start somewhere and fix it over time :)
[12:27:40] <METEMEDO> btw, how do i make a fiddle with jquery? console tells me that $ is not defined, although i loaded jQuery 2.0.2 framework
[12:27:45] <kirua> how to solve this ? http://jsfiddle.net/kirua_sama/wwr2zv8c/1/
[12:27:51] <robertmaxrees> snover huh?
[12:27:57] <kirua> i want the confirmation box to pop up below the button and not the <a>
[12:28:00] <robertmaxrees> dojo isn't the end all be all, but okay.
[12:28:41] <BillCriswell> METEMEDO: It might have just been there from before you loaded jQuery.
[12:29:47] <METEMEDO> but i'm loading all js at the end of the body taf
[12:29:48] <METEMEDO> tag
[12:30:01] <METEMEDO> how do i reproduce that on jsfiddle?
[12:30:12] <METEMEDO> unless i do $.ready
[12:30:29] <METEMEDO> but then it doesn't replicate my code
[12:30:38] <BillCriswell> METEMEDO: Think you want "no wrap in body"
[12:31:20] <BillCriswell> Then whatever you put in <script> will be right before the </body>
[12:31:55] <METEMEDO> ah that's right
[12:31:56] <METEMEDO> :D
[12:31:58] <METEMEDO> thanks
[12:32:29] <BillCriswell> Jon30: http://jsbin.com/berasuma/1/edit?html,output here's my picker.
[12:32:36] <snover> robertmaxrees: i didn’t say that it was the perfect thing for all things, but if someone is looking for a complete set of FOSS user interface controls and utility libraries for writing well-architected, modular code, there still isn’t anything that matches its depth or breadth
[12:33:03] <Jon30> BillCriswell:  I need something fancier
[12:33:16] <Jon30> like the Query Datepicker or Kendo DatePicker
[12:33:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree, but that's fine.
[12:35:15] <akkufomk> is there anyway I can get the height offset from .slideToggle()
[12:35:40] <akkufomk> like after it toggles it returns -height and when it toggles +height
[12:35:46] <akkufomk> I guess I can code it in
[12:35:47] <akkufomk> nvm
[12:36:28] <BillCriswell> Jon30: How about throing some spinner buttons next to the input or something to auto increment the number?
[12:36:44] <snover> robertmaxrees: ok, what are you thinking of that does? because i’m not aware of any.
[12:38:07] <snover> and it would probably be helpful to jon30 to know the answer too so he can look at it
[13:02:45] <hugo_moss> whats the right way to do this
[13:02:53] <hugo_moss> ive created a form
[13:03:05] <hugo_moss> im trying to minimize code duplication
[13:03:31] <hugo_moss> the form has several inputs
[13:04:05] <hugo_moss> when a user loses focus (onblur), the inputbox has a red outline of 1 px, green if its good, red if its invalid
[13:04:43] <hugo_moss> but when i submit, i want it also to outline the boxes that weren't focused in the first place (so blur is never called)
[13:12:23] <dmsuperman> hugo_moss: I would use jquery validator plugin for that
[13:12:29] <dmsuperman> hugo_moss: what you want is easily accomplishable and more
[13:12:56] <dmsuperman> and it has lots of little niceties built in that you would have to find and fix yourself over time with your own solution
[13:14:58] <krambiorix> hi, i try to set the width on a table cell like : $(headrow).find('td').eq($(this).index()).css('width',w+'px').width(w);  -> the width should be applied but i see in firebug (computed) another width then i see in firebug (source) , which is the correct one....
[13:17:02] <dmsuperman> krambiorix: why are you trying to specify the width twice?
[13:17:06] <dmsuperman> I would remove the .width()
[13:17:23] <dmsuperman> I'm not sure which one takes priority but it makes no sense to do both
[13:18:25] <krambiorix> dmsuperman, thanks, solved it, the total table width was too small
[13:30:14] <ezio> how can i load recaptcha into a div through json
[13:51:39] <meatchicken> How do I get the element I just appended with append()?
[13:52:04] <meatchicken> I tried var elem = $(this).append("<div>hello</div>");
[14:00:40] <jmej> I think I might be misunderstanding how the callback part of $.getJSON works. Is there something wrong with this line? $.getJSON('http://api.foo.com?callback=?', function(data){console.log(data);});
[14:01:05] <jmej> I get a 404 error.. but on a link that works if I click on it
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> no need for the callback=? part
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> .
[14:03:28] <jmej> robertmaxrees: well I want to deal with the returned data in a function (console.log is just my example/test).. but maybe i should structure it differently if that callback functionality isn't correct?
[14:04:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to treat it as JSONP?
[14:05:13] <robertmaxrees> because that's when you're want to include the callback=?.  I'd try  $.getJSON('http://api.foo.com?callback=?').done(function(data) { console.log(data) });
[14:05:43] <robertmaxrees> that relies on the new deferred syntax.  if that still gets a 404 make sure you're url is still correct.
[14:07:11] <jmej> ahh ok
[14:07:20] <jmej> that makes sense
[14:07:22] <jmej> thanks!
[14:11:22] <jmej> robertmaxrees: the resource I'm trying to access returns a  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' w/out a callback
[14:11:40] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah so you want jsonp.
[14:11:48] <jmej> yeah - so i'll try this promises approach
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> wait what happens when you hit the URL with the callback=?
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> directly in your browser, i mean.
[14:12:24] <dmsuperman> sounds like he gets a 404?
[14:12:32] <jmej> i get the data if i put it directly in the browser
[14:12:36] <jmej> but from within my script it's a 404
[14:12:46] <robertmaxrees> sounded like he got a 404 when looking at it from the script ^
[14:12:50] <jmej> right
[14:12:51] <dmsuperman> check the network tab and see what request it's actually making
[14:12:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[14:12:58] <dmsuperman> see if it's requesting the same URL you think it is
[14:13:36] <jmej> it's making a get request to a url that isn't exactly what i expect.. but that works when i click it directly
[14:13:49] <jmej> even clicked from the 404 error message
[14:14:20] <dmsuperman> probably the header is making your server respond differently... I think it sends an extra header
[14:14:27] <robertmaxrees> do the request/response headers say anything in particular?
[14:14:55] <dmsuperman> if you're on a system with curl and you're using chrome you can right click the network request, "get CURL....", and run that to give you a 1:1 request
[14:15:04] <robertmaxrees> same with firefox now, too.
[14:15:08] <dmsuperman> cool
[14:16:40] <jmej> dmsuperman: the curl request returns a 404
[14:16:56] <dmsuperman> there you go. paste the curl command if it's not sensitive?
[14:18:44] <jmej> not sensative: http://pastebin.com/XqsjVaMg
[14:19:17] <jmej> and the simplified URL that the network console shows a 404 on is this: http://api.discogs.com/users/jmejia/wants?page=1?callback=jQuery21108000013974960893_1407532510845&_=1407532510846
[14:19:21] <jmej> which works
[14:20:14] <jmej> i'm gonna do a quick refactor with the promises interface robertmaxrees suggested
[14:20:16] <robertmaxrees> wonder if it 's the refferer?
[14:20:34] <robertmaxrees> if it fails in curl promises won't fix it.
[14:20:39] <jmej> ah
[14:21:28] <dmsuperman> you're right robertmaxrees
[14:21:34] <dmsuperman> removing referer from the curl makes it work
[14:21:38] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[14:21:42] <jmej> how do i address that?
[14:21:49] <jmej> where does the referrer header come from?
[14:21:51] <robertmaxrees> that API doesn't like you running off of localhost.
[14:21:53] <dmsuperman> my guess is it's the fact that you're making a cross domain request?
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> the current URL.
[14:22:12] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman he's doing JSONP which should work in this case.
[14:22:16] <jmej> shouldn't it be coming from the browser? not from my server?
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> what URL is in the browser window?
[14:22:35] <dmsuperman> it is, it's saying the request you're making it from is it http://localhost:3000/
[14:22:47] <jmej> robertmaxrees: oh ok right - the browser window is pointed at my express server - yeah
[14:22:50] <robertmaxrees> also, your URL is poorly formatted.
[14:23:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.discogs.com/users/jmejia/wants?page=1&callback=?
[14:23:22] <robertmaxrees> the quertystring starts with ? and every parameter is separated by & after that.
[14:23:27] <jmej> oh woops - yeah :)
[14:23:29] <jmej> thanks
[14:24:07] <jmej> i'm surprised it was still working
[14:24:16] <dmsuperman> web stacks are pretty forgiving to mistakes
[14:24:21] <robertmaxrees> aye
[14:24:27] <dmsuperman> but it makes for confusing results sometimes
[14:24:37] <jmej> hmm. so the solution is to use a qualified domain name?
[14:24:52] <robertmaxrees> worth a shot.
[14:25:01] <dmsuperman> not sure exactly, it sounds like your server just doesn't like the referer. could just be the fact that it's localhost
[14:25:31] <dmsuperman> yeah, using something other than localhost makes it work
[14:25:40] <dmsuperman> even http://derp:3000/ works
[14:25:42] <jmej> can i set a referer property instead of moving this all to a host or something?
[14:25:48] <jmej> just for development
[14:25:49] <dmsuperman> edit your hosts file
[14:25:58] <dmsuperman> map something to point to 127.0.0.1
[14:26:14] <dmsuperman> or you could try using your hostname
[14:26:33] <jmej> aha - yeah 127.0.0.1 is getting me further :)
[14:26:38] <jmej> (of course theres another bug)
[14:26:42] <jmej> but no more 404
[14:26:57] <dmsuperman> I don't think you can change the referer in the javascript
[14:27:01] <dmsuperman> cool
[14:30:45] <jmej> thanks a lot guys - this get request as curl thing is a powerful debugging tool!
[14:40:08] <jmej> so jsonp is also brand new to me - but the callback interface should give me just the data right?
[14:40:25] <jmej> I don't have to traverse the beginning which in this case would look like jQuery21106080462696057864_1407533174640({"meta": {"status": 200}, "data": {
[14:40:31] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:40:44] <robertmaxrees> because "the beginning" is the function you're passing it to.
[14:40:48] <jmej> right
[14:41:07] <robertmaxrees> do you'd have data.meta; for your first bit there.
[14:41:26] <dmsuperman> that structure isn't part of JSONP is it? just the callback format?
[14:41:28] <jmej> oh so i need to do data.data
[14:41:31] <dmsuperman> I've never seen status included
[14:41:35] <jmej> to get back to the structure i care about?
[14:42:07] <dmsuperman> jmej: it's calling that javascript exactly how you see it so you would get exactly the data you see there, so yeah data.data. Unless I'm missing something about the JSONP api
[14:42:09] <robertmaxrees> jmej yep.
[14:42:16] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other object.
[14:42:56] <robertmaxrees> JSONP is "JSON with padding" - the server is returning the data in a function call, just like you'd do yourself if you did myFunctionName({prop: 1, val: 1});
[14:43:54] <jmej> robertmaxrees: my traverse wasn't working because I assumed that the callback would give me just the stuff after "data":
[14:44:04] <jmej> but i had to do data.data.stufficareabout
[14:44:31] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah, it's like any other object - the name you give it when you define the function is the root.
[14:44:31] <jmej> so in your example callbackreturneddata.data.prop
[14:44:33] <jmej> gets you 1
[14:44:41] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:49:31] <robertmaxrees> i get kind of scared whenever i'm able to write coldfusion and feel comfortable in what i'm doing.
[15:56:12] <valentinmu> hello) simple question: how can i access to element in a set of elements using its index in set?
[15:56:44] <valentinmu> by access i mean, that i need to append some data to it :)
[15:57:26] <valentinmu> set of elements looks like $('.classname')
[15:58:13] <valentinmu> i want to do smth like this: $('.classname')[0].append('some data');
[15:58:48] <systemfault> valentinmu: use .eq(index)
[15:58:59] <systemfault> valentinmu: Using the array notation unwraps the DOM Node
[15:59:29] <valentinmu> systemfault: instead of [0] ?
[15:59:36] <systemfault> Yup
[16:00:23] <valentinmu> systemfault: thanks a lot )
[16:01:22] <motaka2> how can i make an array like myarr[12]["someName"] = "someValue"; where 12 changes to some other numbers?
[16:46:26] <hugo_moss> im doing client side form validation, and id like to know if there is a better way of validating 10 form textfields, that each have different requirements, like zipcode length == 5, state, length == 2, is there a better way than just making a huge if/switch statement
[16:46:42] <hugo_moss> i was wondering if polymorphism conditionals will help with this
[16:48:53] <dmsuperman> hugo_moss: jquery validator plugin is wonderful for this
[16:49:01] <dmsuperman> you can apply the rules as HTML attributes and it will do the rest
[16:49:06] <dmsuperman> or you can write the rules in javascript
[16:51:28] <hugo_moss> http://jqueryvalidation.org/?
[16:51:43] <dmsuperman> yep
[16:52:06] <dmsuperman> check out the demos and inspect some of those form elements
[16:52:25] <hugo_moss> found this one too: http://bootstrapvalidator.com/
[16:52:59] <dmsuperman> I believe that's just jqueryvalidator packaged with bootstrap friendly CSS, that would prob work too
[16:53:03] <dmsuperman> if you use bootstrap of course
[16:55:10] <dmsuperman> Nevermind I'm thinking of another library
[16:55:28] <dmsuperman> Personally I prefer jquery validation or something based on it just because it's lightweight, very flexible, and very well honed
[16:55:44] <dmsuperman> but yeah I wouldn't reinvent the wheel no matter which way you go
[16:56:11] <hugo_moss> ya im gonna go with jquery validation
[16:56:45] <hugo_moss> my friend also recommended it
[17:46:46] <joobie> hey guys
[17:46:58] <joobie> anyone able to lend a hand with a jquery effect issue?
[18:10:06] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[18:14:07] <joobie> guys how can i achieve this effect (see the nav menu on the left when you scroll down the page). I want to make the border move each various points of the page, not sure how to do this.. ive got the nav and the border there, but not sure how to make it change at certain positions of the page http://www.getbriefcase.net/site/page?view=implement
[18:15:01] <robertmaxrees> that's probably bootstrap.
[18:15:44] <robertmaxrees> yep.  looked at the source.  you'd have to hook into the window scroll and see with section your on and change classes on the different items.
[18:44:26] <jrockjiggz> anyone use featherlight? cannot seem to get ajax to work.
[19:37:44] <crocket> How do I get the attribute "xlink:href" in http://pastebin.com/QJEr6T5A when the xml namespace "xlink" could change to an arbitrary name?
[19:37:58] <crocket> I just want to get the attribute by the local name.
[19:38:06] <crocket> Can I do it with jquery?
[20:13:55] <frank_o> Hello! Hello! Why does it take so long before this SVG animation begins rendering? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/hcbscj8k/
