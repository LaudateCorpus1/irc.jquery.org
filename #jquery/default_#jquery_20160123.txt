[01:38:28] <Lonesoldier728> Hey so trying to use javascript to build chrome extension but getting this jquery undefined error http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34960441/jquery-is-undefined-in-chrome-extension
[04:06:28] <Kevv> I have a table with a bunch of cells which have a timestamp in them. I have a function to format the date to local from UTC, but how do I call it for each table cell?
[04:22:18] <DexDeadly> I think I have an issue with java but not sure how to fix it.  Here is the page that generates http://pastebin.com/gfhH6PvV however after it loads I can't select my radio buttons.
[04:22:22] <DexDeadly> anyone run into this
[04:27:10] <Vark> What if you just cut the radio button code out of all that and test it, does it work then?
[04:27:40] <DexDeadly> cut it out of where
[04:28:54] <Vark> Without seeing it all working, you should be able to reduce it to just showing the radio buttons, then work backwards putting more things in until it breaks
[04:29:07] <DexDeadly> ok
[04:29:20] <Vark> There is a lot being loaded at the end, is that disabling your buttons for example? (the base HTML works on jsfiddle)
[04:29:46] <DexDeadly> so what I've noticed is while the page is loading if i start clicking the radio buttons select
[04:30:59] <Vark> Then I would suggest something loading or running after document.ready is blocking you
[04:31:09] <Vark> Takes things out, add them back one by one, until you find it
[04:31:19] <Vark> s/takes/take/;
[04:31:19] <b-ot> Correction, <Vark> take things out, add them back one by one, until you find it
[04:31:37] <Vark> Oh, a bot that corrects me :)
[04:32:20] <DexDeadly> removing this <script src="js/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script> worked
[04:32:33] <DexDeadly> first try
[05:21:01] <BoomBox1> Hi, I wanted to understand what's wrong here please? https://jsfiddle.net/ouyqk46u/ It works fine with two classes but the elseif won't work ; Changing the bg of page

[06:36:36] <DuckHuntDog> Hi. Why does jquery break when you try to do .css() on certain elments? Like if you try to do if on a word inside a <code> tag of stackoverflow? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/759631/jquery-how-to-check-if-the-element-has-certain-css-class-style
[06:36:52] <DuckHuntDog> it will result in Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined(â€¦)
[06:37:47] <DuckHuntDog> the element does exist and it does have a .css function. So the problem is internal to the .css function as far as I can tell
[07:35:09] <pihpah> After an AJAX POST request has been made the response header containts a new location to be redirected to. How can I get that value?
[07:36:03] <Woet> pihpah: what have you googled for so far?
[07:38:00] <pihpah> Not much so far. Firebug highlights that sort of requests (302 status code) with red.
[07:39:31] <Woet> pihpah: well, googling "ajax jquery response header" might be useful?
[07:39:41] <pihpah> When I submit my form by click submit buttonh it redirects my to a new page but when I try to do the same thing programatically ($.post('/someurl', $form.serialize())) nothing happens.
[07:39:43] <Woet> pihpah: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1557602/jquery-and-ajax-response-header
[07:44:57] <pihpah> Woet: I found this 'The underlying XMLHttpRequest object used by jQuery will always silently follow redirects rather than return a 302 status code. '
[07:45:14] <pihpah> So why does it not follow redirects in my case?

[08:51:10] <BinBasher> Hi
[08:51:25] <BinBasher> How do I apply http://pastebin.com/6HEBdw4r to http://pastebin.com/LN4845MS ? :s really stuck on it
[08:51:35] <BinBasher> I simply want to hide the block which lets the sound play and do exactly what http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6169666/how-to-resize-an-image-to-fit-in-the-browser-window described to the image
[09:01:39] <Devrim> Anyone knows why this works when I remove the on click part but stops working when I add the onclick part again? https://jsfiddle.net/kgeqonwh/

[09:02:04] <Devrim> but when I throw them together it just doesn't
[09:05:52] <juslintek> Does delegate allow function to be active even after html content is replaced with updated content?
[09:25:19] <Devrim> eh, my problem seems to occur due to an iframe, I click a button in an iframe and it needs to change something outside the iframe
[09:25:22] <Devrim> any fix for that?
[09:31:01] <CarlosEduardo> does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?   https://jsfiddle.net/j2831243/8wd5j8d1/2/  the height is larger than the screen size in 1366x768 screen

[10:40:06] <NehezvoltRegelni> Hi!
[10:40:29] <NehezvoltRegelni> How can i override selectmenu in a way that it renders using my custom method when in idle?
[10:40:30] <NehezvoltRegelni> https://jqueryui.com/selectmenu/#custom_render
[10:40:51] <NehezvoltRegelni> Here is an example, if you select any of the items, then the icon is not visible when the widget is idle
[10:43:11] <jak2000> hi all, howw to detect a selected tab when user press the button "check"  here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/5vp11fp3/1/
[10:46:11] <NehezvoltRegelni> jak2000: <li class="active">
[10:46:42] <NehezvoltRegelni> $('yourul > li.active')
[10:46:45] <NehezvoltRegelni> or something like that
[10:52:46] * NehezvoltRegelni found out the answer, thanks anyhow
[11:20:37] <zotherstupidguy> Woet like when you access an api endpoint from your browser and find that they got a favicon in the browser
[11:20:45] <zotherstupidguy> how they do that??
[11:20:54] <Woet> because browsers automatically load /favicon.ico?
[11:21:31] <zotherstupidguy> i dont know!
[11:21:39] <zotherstupidguy> but it doesnt seem to that!
[11:21:46] <Woet> yes they do!
[11:21:52] <zotherstupidguy> see https://api.github.com/repos/rails/dfdf they got the favicon
[11:22:12] <zotherstupidguy> so favicon.ico is in the root folder?
[11:22:25] <zotherstupidguy> coz i check the source of the file and it is just json ofcourse!
[11:22:30] <Woet> yes? https://api.github.com/favicon.ico
[11:22:42] <Woet> not sure why you ask me instead of just checking
[11:22:52] <zotherstupidguy> Woet awesome!
[11:23:04] <zotherstupidguy> Woet thank youuu :)

[11:27:09] <navi_> I want to show/hide the images in the code based on accordion tab.
[11:27:53] <navi_> mean if personal tab is selected then image1 should be shown if business tab is selected then image2 should be shown and image1 should be hide

[11:29:04] <arc_> where's the jquery code
[11:30:49] <navi_> I am using bootstrap 3 framework
[11:31:52] <navi_> and if anyone can help me using custom jquery. then I have no issue with that. mean I am not restricted to use bootstrap
[11:33:51] <navi_> arc_
[11:34:07] <Uhkis> navi_: start coding it, when you run in to a problem, ask again with the code
[11:34:40] <navi_> actually I don't know jquery and how to code jquery.
[11:34:59] <Uhkis> then you should probably hire a coder
[11:35:09] <navi_> thats why I have asked question here
[11:35:32] <Uhkis> we're not a free coding service lol
[11:35:43] <navi_> can anyone share with me some links to check that. I actually don't get idea that what to search on google regarding it
[11:35:55] <Uhkis> http://learn.jquery.com/
[11:36:22] <navi_> mean specific to the problem which I am facing
[11:37:15] <arc_> you will want to bind a click event listener to each of your accordion tab elements. when those are clicked, you can show() and hide() the specific images as you want. you will need to add a way to specifically select each image, such as a class or ID
[11:37:40] <navi_> can I have some link?
