[11:00:40] <jak2000> hi all
[11:00:42] <jak2000> good morning
[12:46:27] <ppw> hi. I'm trying to dynamically load content into a table with a vertical header.
[12:49:13] <ppw> so I looked here https://css-tricks.com/dynamic-dropdowns/ and realized the first option is out of the question because of CORS policy.
[12:50:14] <ppw> dataTables doesn't support vertical header tables and bootstrap-table doesn't have any documentation on dealing with vertical header tables.
[12:50:54] <ppw> ideally I'd use a JSON file and load its contents into the table on a 'select' option click
[12:51:27] <ppw> can anyone point me into the right direction on how to do that with jQuery?
[14:23:59] <puchacz> hi, with $.post, I can send data as plain object
[14:24:24] <puchacz> but what can I do if I want many http parameters with the same name? I cannot create a plain object like this
[14:24:38] <puchacz> because plain object can only have ONE property with a given name
[14:26:07] <puchacz> ah, ok: $.post( "test.php", { 'choices[]': [ "Jon", "Susan" ] } );
[14:26:17] <puchacz> is [] in the name optional?
[15:13:33] <puchacz> heh. jquery automatically appends [] to name if I pass array
[15:15:13] <puchacz> I don't like it
