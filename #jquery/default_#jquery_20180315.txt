[02:01:31] <HelpPls> Hello
[02:01:44] <HelpPls> Geez, I'm really desperate and stuck in the weeds.
[02:01:58] <HelpPls> I have no idea why this thing won't implement properly, and I don't know enough about JQuery to fix it
[02:02:22] <HelpPls> I'm just trying to call JCrop but it's all screwy and isn't showing up right
[02:02:38] <HelpPls> I know it has something to do with the way I'm calling it
[02:03:41] <HelpPls> Feeling pretty hopeless rn, but I can't give up
[02:03:49] <HelpPls> So I'm going to try my best
[02:04:25] <Cork> HelpPls: make a jsfiddle
[02:05:04] <HelpPls> It's wordpress, but I'll give it a shot
[02:07:33] <HelpPls> Do you know how I can link required files? I need to call the Jcrop.js file
[02:08:08] <HelpPls> (reading)
[02:08:36] <HelpPls> got it
[02:09:08] <Cork> HelpPls: "Resources" on the left
[02:09:21] <HelpPls> ya, looking for a jcrop to link to
[02:11:29] <Cork> HelpPls: https://rawgit.com/tapmodo/Jcrop/master/js/jquery.Jcrop.js
[02:15:57] <HelpPls> https://jsfiddle.net/5oa9aob4/7/
[02:17:55] <Cork> and what isn't working?
[02:23:56] <HelpPls> jcrop isn't initiating for me
[02:24:02] <HelpPls> but that isn't the problem
[02:24:08] <HelpPls> may I pm you a link?
[02:24:36] <HelpPls> just to take a look at, if it's not something you can tell by just looking I'll keep working and see what I can do
[02:26:08] <Cork> HelpPls: try to reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle, it will help you understand the problem, and no i don't have time for pm's
[02:26:19] <HelpPls> yes, I understand I will do my best
[06:32:11] <hola> Hola
[06:32:20] <hola> First time using IRC
[06:34:28] <yumei> Welcome to IRC then :)
[06:34:55] <hola> Thanks
[06:37:48] <dimi1947> can someone tell me why that code does not work:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5wgLubta/  I am frustrated
[06:38:11] <Cork> you don't have an element <btypehide>
[06:38:54] <yumei> $('.wrapper_servp.btypehide').remove();
[06:39:06] <yumei> btypehide isn't a child
[06:40:25] <dimi1947> many thanks..sometimes I make childish mistakes
[06:40:50] <yumei> Happens everyday =Â°)
[07:50:16] <thykka> your children must be pretty smart
[07:50:50] <mark721> hi guys
[07:50:55] <mark721> quick question say if i have a div
[07:51:00] <mark721> thats already attached to the dom
[07:51:05] <mark721> how would i wrap that in an a tag
[07:51:23] <thykka> with .wrap() ? :3
[07:51:29] <mark721> is that a thing?
[07:51:29] <thykka> https://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[07:51:32] <mark721> <3
[08:12:34] <mark721> can you do something like
[08:12:52] <mark721> $('div').getInnerHtml().wrap
[08:12:52] <mark721> ?
[08:13:05] <mark721> or would that be
[08:13:11] <mark721> $('div').text().wrap()
[08:16:47] <thykka> no, .wrap needs an argument
[08:17:10] <mark721> $('div').text().wrap('div')
[08:17:17] <thykka> don't guess; read the docs
[08:17:36] <mark721> well i have found that wrapInner exists.
[08:17:43] <mark721> u cant wrap a string.
[09:04:45] <hellyeah> yo
[09:05:28] <mark721> sup
[09:05:42] <hellyeah> not much how about you?
[09:08:43] <mark721> tryna figure out how to do some css styling :/
[09:09:15] <hellyeah> this is jquery channel what i,s your problem?
[10:48:57] <jordansz> hello everyone
[10:49:21] <jordansz> i have a quick question regarding selecting a specific element inside a loop https://gist.github.com/voordev/699ea5ed6a21a4d7ff02b82d2bb879ee
[10:49:31] <jordansz> any experts know how i can assign the click event on the 'this' element?
[10:49:42] <jordansz> do i need a this.function(){ instead ? a bit confused
[10:56:47] <yumei> Not very clear ?!
[10:56:59] <yumei> Are you trying to do something like this ? $("table click-cell.bs.table").on("click", function(){ alert("ok"); }
[11:03:14] <mark721> hi guys
[11:03:16] <mark721> i have a question
[11:03:57] <mark721> I have a <span class="tag">Clothes<span class="close">x</span></span>
[11:04:06] <mark721> $('#itemtagpool .tag').first().text()
[11:04:13] <mark721> returns ClothesX
[11:04:19] <mark721> i want it to only return Clothes.
[11:04:46] <taplar> then either put it in a span and select that, or get the contents() and get the first one
[11:05:32] <mark721> <3
[12:48:35] <mark721> hi
[12:48:48] <taplar> hey again, :)
[12:48:50] <mark721> taplar, just wanna say u literally saved me lol i had a bugfix and i was like whats wrong
[12:49:08] <taplar> cool
[12:49:10] <mark721> and then i printed and for some particular scenario it was printing both the the element i wanted and its inner element
[12:49:32] <mark721> .contents().first() came in handy again!
[12:49:36] <mark721> ty so much :)
[12:49:47] <taplar> np
[12:49:49] <mark721> the thing is it was a totally different scenario so i was not expecting that to be the fix
[12:51:38] <taplar> the developer in me though would want to suggest you put a span around them and select the specific span
[12:52:03] <taplar> which would allow you to get away from the positional logic that is inherently brittle
[12:53:50] <mark721> meh the issue is the code is too much of a mess already lol
[12:54:06] <mark721> but i do 100% agree with u :)
[12:54:41] <mark721> im not an experienced js/jquery dev so i try not to refactor expecially this close to the deadline
[12:54:48] <mark721> just for the sake that i dont wanna break stuff
[12:54:55] <taplar> understandable
[13:24:22] <mark721> i think we discussed this before but remind me pls
[13:24:30] <mark721> taplar, there is no point having a function in doc ready right]
[13:24:42] <taplar> you can have functions in a document ready
[13:24:53] <mark721> but no point since ur calling it on demand.
[13:24:55] <mark721> ?
[13:24:57] <taplar> doing so scopes them down and prevents possible colisions
[13:25:13] <taplar> it also makes them "private"
[13:27:18] <taplar> i would say it's not an uncommon practice to use a function as a namespace, so in that sense, having functions inside another function makes lots of sense
[13:30:25] <catbadger> narf
[13:30:42] <grapheti> tarf
[13:32:51] <catbadger> so we have this in jq1... $.when.apply($, pending_promises).then( onComplete, onError );
[13:32:55] <catbadger> I'm going to jq3...
[13:33:18] <catbadger> so this no linger works and breaks a lot of our async code
[13:33:27] <catbadger> any ideas?
[13:33:37] <taplar> i'm not seeing why that wouldn't work in 3X
[13:34:19] <taplar> apply is a Function.prototype method, and then was just made A+ compliant
[13:38:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ts25uccz/3/
[13:39:04] <dimi1947> suppose I have a name attribute which has a value....what is the best action to follow for changing it's value
[13:39:17] <catbadger> taplar.. tahnks!
[13:39:19] <catbadger> thanks
[13:39:28] <catbadger> back later
[13:39:41] <taplar> dimi1947: you can use attr() for that
[13:39:52] <taplar> or prop()
[13:40:19] <dimi1947> taplar:ok let us not forget that it allready has a value and I want to alter it
[13:40:44] <taplar> right, attr('newValue')
[13:40:50] <taplar> right, attr('name', 'newValue')
[13:40:54] <dimi1947> I am not saying you are wrong...ok thanks
[13:41:27] <taplar> both prop() and attr() work as a getter and setter, depending on the number of parameters you give it
[13:41:39] <taplar> sorta like how val() is a getter and val('wee') is a setter
[13:42:06] <dimi1947> ok...give me some minutes to test it
[13:47:17] <dimi1947> taplar:yes that did it thanks
[13:47:23] <taplar> yup yup
[13:48:12] <robertmaxrees> taplar++
[14:50:45] <arosen> I'm wondering if anyone knows off hand if having an = sign in an id like : id='asdfadsf=' will cause a problem? It seem's like it is.
[14:51:27] <robertmaxrees> it can, yeah.
[14:52:24] <arosen> robertmaxrees: thanks
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> arosen so the big question is: why do you have IDs with meta-characters in them?
[14:52:50] <robertmaxrees> if you can, remove them.
[15:21:30] <taplar> awesome background; https://www.ihdimages.com/wp-content/uploadsktz/2014/10/wallpaper_nature_spring_hd_background.jpg
[15:43:00] <jak2000> hi
[15:43:31] <taplar> bonjour
[15:45:49] <jak2000> worked with: https://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/   ?
[15:45:54] <jak2000> or any similar?
[15:46:32] <taplar> i've used jquery ui's auto complete
[15:46:50] <jak2000> give me a link please
[15:46:58] <jak2000> is a plugin?
[15:47:03] <taplar> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[15:47:09] <taplar> jquery ui is a plugin to jquery, yes
[15:47:45] <jak2000> ok
[15:47:47] <jak2000> dude
[15:48:02] <jak2000> i want query the elements form a Database with ajax....
[15:48:16] <jak2000> the table have 1000 records... is huge?
[15:48:23] <taplar> pretty large
[15:48:26] <jak2000> ok
[15:48:43] <jak2000> then when user type the first 3 letters, then start try query
[15:48:46] <jak2000> how to do this?
[15:49:23] <taplar> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[15:49:33] <taplar> take a look at the source there.  it has a minLength option
[15:50:00] <taplar> so if you give it a minLength of 3 it will not do anything if less than that
[15:50:38] <jak2000> ok
[15:50:49] <jak2000> source: "search.php",  <---- this result Json object? wich formaat?
[15:51:05] <taplar> most likely json
[15:51:44] <taplar> "The datasource is a server-side script which returns JSON data, specified via a simple URL for the source-option. In addition, the minLength-option is set to 2 to avoid queries that would return too many results and the select-event is used to display some feedback."
[15:51:52] <taplar> right there in the documentation
[15:52:11] <jak2000> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp   <---
[15:52:40] <taplar> sure
[15:54:09] <jak2000> the json woud result is similar to: https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#default ?
[15:54:16] <jak2000> availableTags   ?
[15:54:38] <taplar> yeah, for the default
[15:54:52] <taplar> but there are ways of manipulating it if you need custom rendering
[15:55:20] <taplar> such as with the custom data demo
[15:56:29] <jak2000> i need Code/Description...
[15:56:30] <jak2000> interesting
[16:47:26] <theology> can anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49308902/how-can-i-use-jquery-ui-to-create-image-tooltips-on-top-of-select-options
[16:49:34] <taplar> look at the custom content version: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-content
[16:52:16] <taplar> though you are asking about the hover over for the options
[16:52:35] <taplar> you wouldn't be able to do this for a normal select
[16:52:53] <taplar> you'd have to use some other plugin to have a custom selector before you could tooltip on those options
[16:54:02] <taplar> like possibly combining a selectmenu with tooltip

[18:05:15] <kunal> helloo can some one help me out qith a juery question
[18:05:21] <kunal> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49309798/extract-ckeditor-text-to-a-new-div
[18:05:26] <kunal> thats the quuestion
[18:05:30] <kunal> cant seem to figure this out
[18:06:22] <taplar> which version are you using, however i don't believe ckeditor is a jquery plugin
[18:07:54] <kunal> hmmm
[18:08:05] <kunal> m using the latest one i think
[18:09:08] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4826036/get-ckeditor-content-jquery#4830810
[18:21:38] <Sveta> for `var a = [{a: 1, b: 2}, {a: 2, b: 34}]`, how do i get an array of the `a` values which is [1, 2] programmatically?
[18:22:15] <taplar> you cause the reduce method for that
[18:22:40] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
[18:23:17] <taplar> the initial value would be [], and the reduction method would just push the a value to it
[18:24:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/omtv15s5/  or just map it
[18:24:59] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Map
[18:25:06] <Sveta> thanks. :)
