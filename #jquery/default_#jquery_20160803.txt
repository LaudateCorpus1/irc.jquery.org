[00:19:34] <Fritx> can anyone tell me how I can add another function that does some processing
[00:22:01] <Fritx> something like this
[00:22:03] <Fritx> http://jsfiddle.net/AjwaV/138/
[00:22:27] <Fritx> where the alert wait until getCustomer() is finished
[00:25:31] <Fritx> any tips guys, please
[01:59:11] <sagerdearia> Does anyone have any experience with http://datatables.net/ jQuery library and using filter() function of single column() of results to be applied to a specific child node of each <td></td> instead of the whole contents inside of "<td></td>?"
[02:00:15] <sagerdearia> I previously had table output with <td>value</td> and my javascript code worked, but I changed a single column of data to show an input field with the value inside that text input instead, but also I added <span style="display:none;">value</span> for all rows in the column, that could be used to search for the value instead of the entire contents of td element.
[02:00:46] <sagerdearia> but I'm not sure how to use the datatables api to filter based on child nodes of column results.
[02:01:58] <sagerdearia> For example, I previously used http://pastebin.ca/3672378 to filter table column results when the html of the table was <td>value only</td> and it worked perfectly
[02:02:35] <sagerdearia> but now that html table shows <td><span>value</span><input type=text value=value></td> it doesn't work so well
[02:03:44] <sonu_nk> hi with this " new Date(year, month, 0).getDate(); " method i need to get left days in month suppose today aug 2nd, and left days 29 . but i am geting full days with this
[02:07:17] <sagerdearia> sonu_nk, new Date(2016, 8, 0).getDate() - new Date(2016, 8, 2).getDate()

[02:08:05] <sonu_nk> sagerdearia: ok thank you can you please explain what you did ? i will follow same in my logic
[02:08:14] <sagerdearia> sonu_nk, easy: 31 - 3 == 28
[02:08:30] <sagerdearia> 31 is total number days in month of august, 3 is current date
[02:08:50] <sonu_nk> ok..

[02:42:55] <geeyo> Hello
[02:42:57] <geeyo> I am trying to get the latitude and longitude of my site user. How can I do this?
[02:43:31] <sagerdearia> geeyo, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation
[02:46:37] <geeyo> sagerdearia: I use that, but when I move my device, it doesn't change the location
[02:48:46] <sagerdearia> https://datatables.net/reference/option/columns.data "This property can be used to read and write data to and from any data source property, including deeply nested objects / properties."
[02:49:19] <sagerdearia> It is a property, and not a function, so I'm not sure if this is applicable in terms of referencing children contents of results returned from column() function in the api
[02:49:49] <sagerdearia> but I am trying to figure out how to filter based on data from contents within children of td cells, and not the full value of contents of td cells
[02:50:15] <sagerdearia> table.column('.ptn_num').data().filter(function(value, index, self) { return self.indexOf(value) === index })
[02:50:29] <sagerdearia> that filters based on full contents of td cells for the column .ptn_num
[02:50:47] <sagerdearia> but I want to get the value of ".ptn_num span"
[03:09:12] <jop008> hi using jquery mobile I want to place a <filterable ul inside a field container but how?

[03:17:39] <jop008> the label is not exactly in the center of the input I can't find example with filterable list view in combination with a field container
[03:17:47] <jop008> who can do the rescue?

[03:26:16] <jop008> thanks it must be possible with plain vanilla jqm also dont youthink?
[03:27:14] <Fritx> I really can't tell, but that plugin (chosen) is really straight forward and easy to get it up an working
[03:27:25] <Fritx> I am here to get help myself :)
[04:01:47] <tapia> Hi! I'm trying to get jquery-ui from npm, but, unlike jquery, it doesn't include a complete .js, you must build it manually
[04:02:20] <tapia> do you know if I can get somewhere in NPM a pre-built file?
[04:02:37] <tapia> it must be in npm, I can't get it from a CDN
[04:06:07] <PCatinean> Hey guys, I have a jquery script that fires a ajax request when a select field has a changed value and updates the options
[04:06:20] <PCatinean> I want to simulate the select change via another jquery script but it does not seem to fire for some reason
[04:06:29] <PCatinean> even though I do select.val(option).change()
[04:10:46] <istanbul> hello.. How can I update is this code, for infinite news(I mean, first article come to the view in mvc project by action, then the other news are coming by scrolling down by ajax request, so this code is not working on other news..) how can I update this code, like using on or live or something else? https://codeshare.io/c7LP4
[04:17:32] <midori-rus> is search element by id faster that by data-attr?
[04:17:37] <midori-rus> than*
[04:17:52] <AdamPDotty> yep
[04:18:16] <AdamPDotty> istanbul: How would we know your classes?
[04:19:25] <AdamPDotty> You probably want something like $('#container_around_articles').on('click', 'a', ChangeClass);
[04:21:23] <AdamPDotty> PCatinean: try select.trigger('change'); or select.change();
[04:21:37] <PCatinean> AdamPDotty, tried both, it's strange
[04:29:46] <istanbul> thanks AdamPDotty, I'm working on http://www.atv.com.tr/haberler/2016/08/01/atv-10-aydir-zirvede  , I wanted to try your suggest, but I could use it on my code.. There is buttons for making the content bigger or smaller, "AA" on right top side of the content.. for first news its working, but for the others, its not..
[04:30:07] <istanbul> *couldnt, sorry
[04:32:56] <istanbul> now, I've added the ChangeClass function my codeshare link.. https://codeshare.io/c7LP4
[04:33:22] <AdamPDotty> do not use links, if you want a button
[04:33:55] <AdamPDotty> ah, so the buttons are not iside the articles
[04:33:58] <AdamPDotty> n
[04:34:14] <AdamPDotty> oh, should look further
[04:35:52] <istanbul> I've just add the .on on my local machine, but it didnt work, maybe I've added on wrong place.. or something more is needed
[04:36:52] <AdamPDotty> all arcticles are inside that <section> ?
[04:37:05] <AdamPDotty> -c
[04:40:37] <AdamPDotty> $('.haberDetay'),find('section').on('click', 'button', ChangeClass);
[04:40:42] <AdamPDotty> then in ChangeClass
[04:41:18] <AdamPDotty> if (($this).is(':first-child')) ...
[04:42:05] <istanbul> yes all articles are inside that section, after first news, others comes inside, by ajax request..
[04:42:34] <AdamPDotty> you have to change it to button first
[04:43:06] <AdamPDotty> but you do not need an explicit parameter
[04:46:29] <AdamPDotty> if you use section for the event handler you only need to apply it once, and it will also work for added elements
[04:47:17] <AdamPDotty> in what you wrote now you search for a inside a
[05:34:32] <PythDasch> hey everybody
[05:34:57] <PythDasch> I would like to select all attributes beginning by data-name-* do you know how to do this ?
[05:35:11] <PythDasch> I saw only a filter for the value
[05:35:57] <sonu_nk> how to get months initals like august is Aug >?
[05:37:51] <decx> PythDasch: get data() without a key and then reduce that object with its keys
[05:38:37] <PythDasch> decx, what do you mean ?
[05:38:39] <decx> sonu_nk: you might have to map it
[05:38:53] <PythDasch> because I need to catch all attributes from a page beginning by ****
[05:39:01] <PythDasch> in order to treat their values
[05:39:35] <sonu_nk> decx: can you help me or can give me link from wher ei can read
[05:39:35] <sonu_nk> ?
[05:40:04] <PythDasch> sonu_nk, don't think it's jquery
[05:40:04] <decx> just have an array ['jan','feb'....]
[05:40:14] <decx> then you can array[.getMonth]
[05:41:04] <PythDasch> decx, I think you answered me if I was selecting an element
[05:41:21] <PythDasch> but I would  like to catch all elements that have attributes beginning with name *
[05:41:35] <decx> dont select elements by attribute
[05:41:43] <decx> add class and water
[05:42:12] <PythDasch> ok
[05:42:15] <PythDasch> thanks
[05:42:22] <decx> you can still filter it
[05:42:32] <PythDasch> think so
[05:42:34] <PythDasch> I'll try
[05:42:35] <PythDasch> thx
[05:47:45] <sonu_nk> decx: ok got it and did same.. i was thinking it could be done by Javascript or jquery
[05:48:14] <sonu_nk> decx: also if i want to get year 2016 to 26 or 2017 to 1 then i need to parse  it ?
[05:48:37] <decx> wat
[05:49:34] <sonu_nk> means i need to get year in 16,17 format. means last 2 chars , but js giving me 2016
[05:49:41] <sonu_nk> decx: ^
[05:50:12] <decx> substring?
[05:50:35] <sonu_nk> yes decx i think i need to get sub str it .. right or javascript can do it ?
[05:50:36] <decx> btw i just remembered that we now have toLocaleString so you dont even need the array anymore
[05:51:35] <decx> (if you only target new browers that is)
[05:52:05] <PythDasch> decx, I need to have the attribute name and value in order to create an object like {name: value) do you know if it's possible ?
[05:52:27] <decx> data() is an object
[05:52:33] <PythDasch> ha ok
[05:52:34] <PythDasch> nice
[06:58:09] <alluringme> Hi, this code worked perfectly for 5 entries. http://laravel.io/bin/De53W Now it complains of "XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/ABCD-w/formResponse. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access."
[06:58:21] <alluringme> any way to solve this?
[07:06:00] <dzmien> alluringme: try searching google for no 'access-control-allow-origin' header is present. I am not familiar enough with AJAX to help you myself, but it looks like there are some good stack exchange questions that might help you.
[07:06:30] <dzmien> unless you've already done that, then my apologies :P
[07:07:43] <alluringme> dzmien, hi. Np, thanks for the response. That's the exact issue :-( its preventing me from accessing the sheet. I will try searching for that and see where it goes.
[07:08:06] <dzmien> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20433655/no-access-control-allow-origin-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resource-or
[07:08:26] <dzmien> that might give you some clues.
[07:08:33] <alluringme> otherwise I must implement a proxy for that: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20364662/access-control-allow-origin-error-on-google-drive-web-site
[07:08:42] <alluringme> Thanks, I am checking that.
[07:09:08] <Uhkis> alluringme: were the other entries non 404 responses from google?
[07:09:46] <alluringme> Uhkis, it worked upright. No 404s. I think Google is forcing users to use API.
[07:10:00] <alluringme> They made the entries in Google form in question.
[07:10:05] <Uhkis> well obviously
[07:10:33] <dzmien> You might have to get an API key or something
[07:10:38] <alluringme> Haha, small task + Google API = ONE BIG MESS.
[07:11:17] <Uhkis> depends on the api
[07:12:47] <alluringme> Well, i've never consumed their api for sheets or forms. Do you have a example which shows me how to send form data using API? Maybe javascript, jquery or php. ty.
[07:13:24] <dzmien> https://developers.google.com/sheets/
[07:13:27] <dzmien> ?
[07:14:40] <alluringme> dzmien, not that. :) I already checked that. Wanted an example. I will search for it a little later.
[07:15:24] <dzmien> But that is the API you are trying to use?
[07:16:26] <Uhkis> i think there's #google or something channel for google api talk
[07:17:38] <alluringme> dzmien. That's correct. I must be using that. Uhkis, I will try that chan.
[08:09:50] <Preuk> hi, foudn quite a few things online about angularJS / jqueryui integration
[08:10:10] <Preuk> but i'm looking for tips about jquery mobile + angular2 integration, any clue?
[10:12:23] <Vady> Hello, is there a way to hide a jquery code?
[10:12:31] <taplar> not really
[10:12:45] <decx> hide?
[10:13:16] <taplar> you can uglify it to make it harder to read or put it on a request to make it harder to find for those that don't know where to look
[10:13:24] <taplar> but it doesn't really serve a purpose
[10:13:28] <taplar> hiding that is
[10:13:42] <Vady> oh so it's the same as js
[10:13:49] <taplar> jquery is js
[10:51:19] <rails45> Let's say there's a text box, clicking upon which a list of items pops up. Now you press your keyboard down arrow and start cycling through the list (the text input is still in focus because you initially clicked on it). Now how do you target the specific list item that is "focused" using the arrow key?
[10:55:00] <shoky> the same way you targeted it in order to "focus" it..?   asking a vague question about a hypothetical text box won't get you far
[10:55:38] <shoky> make a jsfiddle/testcase showing the problem and we can find out exactly how to target whatever you want
[11:02:03] <lilwiz> Is it possible to link and toggle a specific data-filter through an URL? If you have 2 categories using data-filter on page B, and from page A you want to link to page B, but you want a specific active filter to show, is this possible to alter through a link?
[11:02:29] <rails45> @shoky Here you go -- https://jsfiddle.net/skelly/9R4cV/
[11:03:41] <rails45> Type "a" in the text field and you'll see a bunch of suggestions coming up. Use your keyboard arrows to scroll through the list. Now how would I target the currently highlighted list item?
[11:04:07] <PythDasch>  hey everyone, I've a simple class http://pastebin.com/jmstrxUA but when I'm in the vote() methods I can't access to the this of the class. Does someone knows why ?
[11:04:16] <rails45> Using $(':focus') doesn't work, because the text field is already focused
[11:05:18] <shoky> rails45: what do you want to do with it?
[11:07:06] <rails45> @shoky I'm trying to change the text in the search field to reflect the text of the highlighted item. I know, that's exactly what it does in the fiddle. But I'm using the rails gem for jquery autocomplete and it doesn't do this by default. So I thought of manually replicating it
[11:09:02] <shoky> rails45: i'd try to understand why it's not doing it, or how to change the options to enable it..
[11:11:03] <shoky> rails45: but anyways one answer to your question is $('#ui-active-menuitem')
[11:13:39] <shoky> rails45: at least that works in the jquery-ui version you chose in that fiddle
[11:13:53] <shoky> if you're using a different version.. might be different
[11:18:55] <shoky> for later versions it could be $('.ui-autocomplete .ui-menu-item .ui-state-focus')  or   $('.ui-autocomplete .ui-menu-item .ui-state-active')
[11:19:48] <rails45> @shoky Ahh I'm gonna try those out. Thanks!
[11:20:03] <shoky> rails45: er but you can just use the focus event's arguments to get it
[11:20:12] <shoky> rails45: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-focus
[11:24:04] <rails45> @shoky yeah i visited that link but didn't know how to do it with the arguments. i'm a noob in jquery, really. but i just tried '.ui-state-focus' as you suggested and it works like a charm! thanks a lot!
[11:24:12] <Vady> Hey, I'm trying to make a jquery chat, and I followed a tutorial, which does a separate post echoing, this seems useless, can I do a dynamic refresh instead and it would show me the newly posted message ?
[11:24:36] <shoky> rails45: https://jsfiddle.net/9R4cV/665/
[11:32:09] <taplar> Vady: your wanting the page to refresh when someone talks?
[11:32:30] <Vady> no, want it to update the messages instead
[11:32:44] <taplar> ?
[11:33:19] <Vady> uhmm
[11:33:23] <Vady> how would you make a chat script?
[11:33:48] <taplar> if i was going to make it appear to be real time i'd use some form of polling, if i wanted real time i'd use websockets
[11:34:23] <Vady> appear real time?
[11:34:51] <taplar> polling isn't technically real time.  there is the delay between the poll requests
[11:35:28] <Vady> uhmm no idea which one i'm doing
[11:35:29] <Vady> http://dpaste.com/0M7C9V4
[11:35:58] <taplar> your not doing either.  your getting the messages when someone does something
[11:36:26] <Vady> is that a bad way to do it?
[11:36:41] <taplar> no, it's just not going to update without user interaction
[11:37:05] <Vady> hmm
[11:37:09] <Vady> I think I need to do websockets
[11:37:16] <Vady> Imma research what those are
[11:47:51] <Vady> Ok, this seems pretty fast
[11:47:58] <Vady> but it also seems hard to integrate with a database
[11:50:15] <Xatenev> Heya
[11:50:22] <Xatenev> I try $('#test').insertAfter(".class");
[11:50:32] <Xatenev> aswell i tried $('#test').html().insertAfter(".class");
[11:50:40] <Xatenev> I get weird errors like insertAfter is not a function, failed to exec queryselector
[11:50:48] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.jquery
[11:50:50] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[11:55:11] <taplar> Vady: what is?
[11:57:12] <Vady> taplar, a chat using websockets
[11:57:37] <taplar> it'll take a little bit to get acclimated to the pub sub model, :)

[12:14:07] <mad_moses> hi, can i change the current url with jquery? (I want to modify a get value in my url)
[12:14:25] <taplar> window.location.href = 'whatever'
[12:14:43] <taplar> don't need jquery for that
[12:15:04] <mad_moses> taplar: is there some logic within jquery to update get values in my url?
[12:15:14] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[12:15:22] <taplar> jquery is for accessing the dom
[12:16:13] <mad_moses> taplar: do you know a good solution to fulfil my requeirments to update get values in my url?
[12:16:32] <taplar> "update get values".  what are you trying to do?
[12:18:01] <mad_moses> taplar: www.example.com?---...alotofgetvalues---...&guests=12 change the guests get values to 10 for example
[12:19:50] <taplar> oh, you can google "javascript change url parameters" for various examples
[12:19:56] <taplar> or hit up ##javascript to inquire
[12:20:59] <mad_moses> thank you

[12:42:45] <Duikb00t-home> You mean to use it on the li instead of on the a
[12:42:45] <Duikb00t-home> $( '#admin-menu li a' ).hover(
[12:42:46] <taplar_lunch> from what i can understand your wanting to change the h3's to be h4, h5, h6, ...
[12:42:53] <taplar_lunch> Duikb00t-home: yep
[12:43:00] <Duikb00t-home> that's doing weird stuff then :D
[12:43:01] <taplar_lunch> your nested logic will have to change, but yes
[12:43:11] <Duikb00t-home> idd
[12:43:13] <Duikb00t-home> indeed8
[12:43:26] <mok> okie i got your point
[12:43:33] <mok> so what's the good way to do so
[12:43:41] <taplar_lunch> 4, 5, 6
[12:43:46] <taplar_lunch> your index is 0, 1, 2
[12:43:48] <taplar_lunch> so...
[12:44:53] <mok> so to change the looping without using .each()
[12:45:06] <taplar_lunch> no
[12:45:21] <taplar_lunch> what's the difference between the index and the value you want to use?  mathematically?
[12:46:29] <mok> you mean the mathematically way of the looping ?
[12:46:40] <taplar_lunch> the index is
[12:46:42] <taplar_lunch> 0, 1, 2
[12:46:45] <taplar_lunch> your wanting
[12:46:48] <taplar_lunch> 4, 5, 6
[12:46:52] <taplar_lunch> what's the difference?
[12:47:24] <mok> the i[0]=4 and i[2]=5 and i[6]=6
[12:47:26] <Duikb00t-home> Almost there :) https://jsfiddle.net/dpmw51df/1/
[12:47:33] <mok> sorry
[12:47:47] <taplar_lunch> think simple math mok
[12:47:49] <mok> i[1]=5 and i[2] =6
[12:48:39] <mok> i[index] = value
[12:48:45] <taplar_lunch> math
[12:48:52] <taplar_lunch> have 0, want 4
[12:48:55] <taplar_lunch> have 1, want 5
[12:49:33] <Duikb00t-home> got it !
[12:49:47] <Duikb00t-home> +4
[12:49:47] <taplar_lunch> cool
[12:49:53] <taplar_lunch> *shsssss*
[12:49:55] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:49:57] <Duikb00t-home> :D haha
[12:50:36] <taplar_lunch> i feel confused sometimes.  like i feel like i'm spelling it out, but it's not clicking
[12:50:50] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/dpmw51df/2/  -- taplar_lunch
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> taplar_lunch hahaha i hear that.
[12:50:58] <Duikb00t-home> Have you an idea why that stupid indentation is there?
[12:51:17] <mok> i did not get your point
[12:51:34] <taplar_lunch> Duikb00t-home: what indention are you talking about?
[12:51:42] <Duikb00t-home> when you hover
[12:51:45] <taplar_lunch> mok: index +4 will get you the number your after
[12:51:49] <Duikb00t-home> the text is like 20px to the right
[12:51:49] <taplar_lunch> right?
[12:51:54] <Duikb00t-home> yes to the right
[12:52:01] <Duikb00t-home> :P
[12:52:30] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home that's apart of the native UL styles.
[12:52:31] <robertmaxrees> padding.
[12:52:39] <Duikb00t-home> oh
[12:52:40] <robertmaxrees> what's mok's question?
[12:52:46] <Duikb00t-home> btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS1bRVkc7J4   about right

[12:52:58] <taplar_lunch> he's trying to logically change h3's to h4, h5, h6... for some reason
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> via JS?  that's strange.  but OK.
[12:53:23] <taplar_lunch> i'm ignoring the big question, but just working the logic anyway
[12:53:32] <robertmaxrees> hah
[12:53:38] <taplar_lunch> ;)
[12:54:21] <mok> so if i have more than h3 in one block, and i want to change them by h3 to h4 and the other to h5 and the other to h6
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> mso then
[12:54:47] <robertmaxrees> woops - so then where are you stuck?
[12:54:54] <Duikb00t-home> mso.. ? Melbourne Symphony Orchestra
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> mistype.
[12:55:02] <Duikb00t-home> Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra
[12:55:05] <Duikb00t-home> oh
[12:55:19] <robertmaxrees> hence my "woops" ;)
[12:55:39] <Duikb00t-home> >>> Being to long working on my application today time to quit
[12:57:02] <mok> i am stuck in understanding how to do so
[12:57:16] <robertmaxrees> have you tried to make a fiddle to play with?
[12:57:19] <mok> that's my code https://jsfiddle.net/2o9q973r/5/ it's wrong but i need to understand the way to do so
[12:57:40] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/2o9q973r/6/ was your code, :P
[12:58:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm really confused aby why you'd have headings in a footer element.
[12:58:12] <mok> :D yea afte /6/
[12:58:57] <mok> yea of course in the footer looks messy and out of sense
[12:59:04] <mok> but consider it in any div
[12:59:22] <robertmaxrees> just to ask the obvious question: why not do this in your backend?
[12:59:22] <taplar_lunch> so as i told you, you can get your number your after by index + 4, no?
[13:00:17] <mok> yea, of course i can do it, but this idea got my mind stuck and i want to solve this issue
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> then use taplar's suggestion.  Problem solved.
[13:01:04] <mok> the problem is i did not get the point of teplar's
[13:01:08] <mok> :D
[13:01:23] <taplar_lunch> do you get it now?
[13:01:24] <robertmaxrees> where in their suggestion are you getting lost?
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> you take the index, then add 4.
[13:01:46] <mok> can u fiddle it ?
[13:01:53] <mok> to understand more
[13:01:57] <robertmaxrees> that's not the idea ;)
[13:02:04] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you figure it out.
[13:02:25] <mok> yes of course i did not mean that
[13:02:48] <taplar_lunch> assume your going to have a variable in your each, maybe "hNumber"
[13:02:53] <mok> but i meant i might get it more by code
[13:02:56] <taplar_lunch> if you were going to set it to the value you wanted, how would you do that?
[13:03:01] <taplar_lunch> with what we've suggested?
[13:04:43] <mok> i am confused
[13:04:49] <taplar_lunch> about?
[13:05:48] <Duikb00t-home> in html creating an other attribute
[13:05:54] <Duikb00t-home> like.. a price in an input field
[13:06:10] <Duikb00t-home> data-price="10" ? is that the way it should be generated?
[13:06:12] <mok> the index and element theory i understand it
[13:06:15] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home yep.
[13:06:17] <Duikb00t-home> thx
[13:06:23] <robertmaxrees> use data attributes for stuff like that.
[13:06:38] <Duikb00t-home> awesome
[13:06:50] <robertmaxrees> and then use .data() to read/write those.
[13:07:19] <mok> that .each() will go through every index with it's element
[13:07:19] <Duikb00t-home> 1 small other logic thing :)
[13:07:39] <Duikb00t-home> when I have an application and I have somewhere a form where specific logic should be
[13:07:44] <taplar_lunch> mok: it will go though every element, providing their index
[13:07:55] <Duikb00t-home> do you first check if the element is available before executing the jquery?
[13:07:59] <Duikb00t-home> Or is that not needed?
[13:08:06] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home depends on what you're doing.
[13:08:39] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home generally you don't run the logic for a page if you're not on that page.
[13:08:41] <Duikb00t-home> creating a calculation for a from :)
[13:08:51] <Duikb00t-home> ok :)
[13:09:16] <mok> yes
[13:09:24] <mok> but
[13:10:26] <mok> so it's logically can be done
[13:10:32] <mok> right ?
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> mok... yes.
[13:10:37] <taplar_lunch> we've been telling you how
[13:10:47] <taplar_lunch> i even asked you how to do part of it, which you didn't reply to
[13:10:51] <robertmaxrees> very easily.  you've been given instructions multiple times on how to do it.
[13:11:14] <mok> yes cuz i did not get the point :)
[13:11:22] <mok> and i told u that
[13:11:31] <robertmaxrees> mok so where are you getting confused?
[13:11:34] <robertmaxrees> specifically.
[13:11:43] <taplar_lunch> to which i asked what you were confused about.  and then you explained that you understood the each(), :|
[13:12:16] <mok> I understand the .each()
[13:12:22] <taplar_lunch> which wasn't my question, lol
[13:12:32] <mok> yea :D
[13:13:02] <robertmaxrees> mok soooo then answer the question?
[13:14:46] <mok> i am confused on how to make it auto increment the h+i to replace it with each(h3)
[13:15:01] <robertmaxrees> within the each, you replace the tag with a new one.
[13:15:02] <taplar_lunch> remember, index + 4 ?
[13:15:07] <robertmaxrees> the new one is the index + 4
[13:15:14] <robertmaxrees> are you confused about how to replace the tag?
[13:16:34] <mok> yes i am confused about that
[13:16:41] * taplar_lunch cheers
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend :)
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3435871/jquery-how-to-change-tag-name here's one way.
[13:17:41] <taplar_lunch> which is kinda close to what is in the commented parts
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:18:01] <mok> :)
[13:18:14] <taplar_lunch> you don't really have to wrap it to get the html() though
[13:18:19] <taplar_lunch> but, that's for later
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> :) yeah, worry about that later.
[13:19:22] <mok> to understand the .replacewith
[13:19:27] <mok> is not my problem :)
[13:19:34] <taplar_lunch> but... you just said
[13:19:40] <robertmaxrees> then what IS your problem?
[13:21:16] <mok> now i have two h3 tags inside a div okie. so i want to change each one with h4 to h5
[13:21:25] <robertmaxrees> hence repalceWith.
[13:21:28] <robertmaxrees> *replaceWith
[13:22:04] <alluringme> Hey robertmaxrees. A small doubt. This used to work before: http://laravel.io/bin/52KaY. I am sending data to Google sheet. I mean it worked for me today while sending data for a couple of tuples. Now it complains about, XMLHttpRequest cannot load: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access. Any easy fix please?
[13:22:11] <mok> the replacewith function will replace the tag
[13:22:14] <mok> yes of course
[13:22:42] <robertmaxrees> alluringme why are you pinging me specifically?
[13:22:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:22:57] <taplar_lunch> he knows how to spot excellence
[13:22:57] <alluringme> Heh, I know I'll get an answer. :D
[13:23:26] <alluringme> taplar_lunch, heh, he is always the first to answer. Thus tried me luck. :D
[13:23:26] <robertmaxrees> that's kind of messed up fwiw.
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> plenty of other folks that could help you :)
[13:23:52] <alluringme> It worth a try. :P
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:24:05] <mok> I have to go right now :)
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> either way, try google.
[13:24:12] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd do in this case.
[13:24:31] <mok> thank's anyway :D
[13:24:46] <alluringme> Well, I'll do that. :-( The only other option is to learn how to work with Google API lol
[13:24:54] <taplar_lunch> terrible idea
[13:25:17] <alluringme> Just to get 3 feilds learn and consume a API. XD
[13:25:29] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be too hard.
[13:25:32] <robertmaxrees> but meh
[13:26:18] <alluringme> I didn't want to learn because this client isn't paying much. But, anyways, I got to learn it anyways.
[13:26:33] <taplar_lunch> then update your resume
[13:26:38] <robertmaxrees> boom
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> extra money in the future.
[13:26:53] <alluringme> How are things shaping up for you rob. Better now??
[13:27:05] <alluringme> taplar_lunch : That's true. I should learn it.
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> eh, still pretty crappy.  we'll see what happens.  the next few weeks are going to be challenging.
[13:27:48] <alluringme> Same same same. I got to get payments.
[13:28:19] <alluringme> That's the very reason I took this small yet slaveLabor. XD
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> heh, mine has all been pretty big family drama.
[13:28:59] <alluringme> awww, it'll be better. :D
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> eh, we'll see.
[13:30:16] <alluringme> I'll run me eyes on those docs then. You have fun and thanks for your time.
[13:30:17] <alluringme> :D
[14:09:21] <Duikb00t-home> o/ taplar_lunch
[14:09:52] <Duikb00t-home> Have you a second to help me out a bit? :) Im struggling a bit with " how to achieve this"
[14:10:02] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home you can just ask the channel :)
[14:10:07] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[14:12:59] <Duikb00t-home> https://jsfiddle.net/v975k8hx/1/
[14:13:13] <Duikb00t-home> I have all my input fields all those fields are being rendered by a dynamic back-end
[14:13:26] <Duikb00t-home> and every input field has a data-price="13"...
[14:13:44] <Duikb00t-home> now I would like to detect when a user enters 3 for a field that the total price will be shown
[14:13:50] <Duikb00t-home> At the bottom
[14:14:02] <Duikb00t-home> What's the best way to do this for 'all rendered' fields
[14:14:02] <robertmaxrees> so you want a change event handler.
[14:14:15] <robertmaxrees> and then you could .map().get() for the data you want.
[14:14:54] <robertmaxrees> though I'm confused about what you're using data attributes for.
[14:15:04] <Duikb00t-home> the price :)
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> why not store that in the value?
[14:15:19] <Duikb00t-home> the value of the field?
[14:15:21] <robertmaxrees> or is that the price per unit?
[14:15:25] <Duikb00t-home> exactly
[14:15:29] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> so then yeah, .map() that.
[14:15:49] <Duikb00t-home> that's new to me cool learning something new! ;)
[14:15:53] <robertmaxrees> you know how to bind an event listener?
[14:16:33] <Duikb00t-home> On('change' ?
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:05] <Duikb00t-home> can I just select then all input fields?
[14:17:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so the idea is you grab all the relevant inputs, then use jquery's .map().get() to get an array of all the final values for each field.
[14:18:00] <robertmaxrees> also: var dishes = $('#add-reservation-form').find('#dishes');
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - don't do that.
[14:18:13] <robertmaxrees> var $dishes = $('#dishes')
[14:19:11] <Duikb00t-home> I fixed that
[14:19:34] <Duikb00t-home> console.log(dishes.find(':input')); https://www.pastery.net/xwhgek/
[14:19:49] <robertmaxrees> you can just do .find('input')
[14:20:08] <Duikb00t-home> dishes.find('input'); you mean
[14:20:20] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:24:11] <arc_> i wonder how google does that prefetching of the first result. like okay, i get that it could just have that whole url as a prefetched resource but how does it make the browser use that data when you actually click on it and go to a completely different url from the one you're on
[14:25:14] <robertmaxrees> arc_ what prefetching?
[14:25:33] <arc_> google automatically starts loading the first search result when you submit a search
[14:25:40] <arc_> because the majority of the time that's what you're going to click on anyway
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> they do?
[14:25:48] <arc_> yep
[14:25:50] <robertmaxrees> proof?
[14:26:16] <arc_> umm idk if i'll be able to find anywhere that they talk about it, but if you search for something and then wait a bit, then click on the first result, it will load instantly
[14:26:53] <arc_> i guess you could also look at the network tab
[14:28:45] <arc_> that might be kind of hard to interpret
[14:29:35] <robertmaxrees> that sounds... dubious to me.
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> because that would violate CORS.
[14:30:37] <arc_> i suppose it's possible that i'm wrong, but i don't think i dreamed this up myself, and a lot of times when i search for something and click the first result, the page appears in the same instant that i clicked on the link, which shouldn't even be possible without doing that
[14:30:48] <Duikb00t-home> Currently here: https://jsfiddle.net/v975k8hx/3/
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> arc_ right, no real way to do that.
[14:31:07] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm confused.
[14:31:29] <arc_> i guess maybe it only works on domains that google controls...?
[14:31:30] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home nah, no need to do it that way.
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> arc_ that would make more sense.
[14:31:44] <Duikb00t-home> :'(
[14:32:09] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home one sec.
[14:33:14] <robertmaxrees> Duikb00t-home
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v975k8hx/5/
[14:33:29] <robertmaxrees> that's why i suggested using .map().get() - then you get a nice reduce, too.
[14:33:32] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.
[14:33:34] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeee
[14:35:03] <Duikb00t-home> uhmm
[14:35:08] <Duikb00t-home> how fast can you type? :D
[14:35:10] <Duikb00t-home> Thanks a lot
[14:35:19] <Duikb00t-home> :D
[14:35:23] <Duikb00t-home> le mee analyze that
[14:41:42] <Duikb00t-home> thx!
[15:03:06] <wa5ted> afternoon boys
[15:59:32] <kegster> i need to set the background of a canvas to a certain image url, but I need to also get the width/height of said image at the same time so I can properly scale the canvas. is this possible?
[16:01:05] <kegster> woops
[16:01:10] <kegster> meant to put that in js not jquery
[16:01:10] <kegster> :D
[16:26:10] <arc_> robertmaxrees i remembered what it was
[16:26:18] <arc_> it's a feature of chrome + google called instant pages
[16:26:23] <arc_> so it's not google.com doing it, it's chrome
[16:26:52] <arc_> kinda weird for a browser to have a website-specific feature, but i guess that's what happens when a web service company makes a web browser
[16:27:12] <robertmaxrees> heh, all about getting you to and and from where you want to be asap.
[16:27:20] <robertmaxrees> they want you looking at ads.
[16:35:09] <wa5ted> hi robertmaxrees
[16:35:13] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:40:08] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees haven spoken in ages

[16:56:05] <robertmaxrees> istanbul fwiw there's a dude who got busted doing that and it didn't end well for him.
[16:56:16] <istanbul> what can I do?
[16:56:33] <robertmaxrees> not lie to your superiors.
[16:56:38] <robertmaxrees> tell them you're struggling.
[16:56:53] <istanbul> so they fire me?
[16:56:59] <istanbul> I need job now.
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:57:05] <robertmaxrees> what
[16:57:12] <robertmaxrees> do you really think they'd fire you?
[16:57:27] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees it is possible we dont know his circumstances
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> anybody who admits they're struggling shouldn't be fired - your company should want to help you.
[16:57:41] <wa5ted> istanbul if you are relaly interested in keeping your job learn from the basics and work our way up
[16:58:03] <robertmaxrees> istanbul are you in the us or somewhere else in the world?
[16:59:36] <robertmaxrees> I ask because most employers in the US should be able to help you out.  It sounds like maybe you got yourself in a bit over your head and are striggling.
[17:00:29] <robertmaxrees> but lying and asking to have somebody else do your work is a really bad idea - there was a dude at verizon who got busted doing that and it cost him his job.
[17:02:18] <robertmaxrees> welp
[17:14:04] <taplar> mmm, if we got fired for struggling, crap man
[17:14:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:14:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't think i've ever seen an employee get fired over admitting they're struggling.
[17:15:04] <taplar> i might have, but then again, that was back around '08
[17:15:15] <taplar> and it was an on going thing
[17:17:15] <taplar> heh, those that don't struggle, imho, usually end up looking for another job anyway
[17:30:31] <taplar> i want a pikachu car... https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimages2.fanpop.com%2Fimage%2Fphotos%2F10900000%2Fpikachu-car-two-pikachu-10908829-1280-960.jpg&f=1
[17:31:10] <taplar> and it better be fully electric
[17:31:33] <taplar> ohhhh, and the horn.  lmao
[17:31:40] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:31:42] <robertmaxrees> that'd be terrifying.
[17:33:45] <taplar> wonder what model it is.  how you'd classify it on your insurance
[18:20:29] <Gasher> hello, I have no idea what I'm doing wrong, but even this little code snippet doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/Y0kvxKNY
[18:20:44] <Gasher> the alert fires when I open the page, and not when I'm pressing the button
[18:20:51] <robertmaxrees> because $("#mybut").click(alert("Hello!")); is wrong :)
[18:20:59] <robertmaxrees> click() takes a function object.
[18:21:00] <Gasher> how should it be?
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> but you're giving it the return of the alert()
[18:21:23] <robertmaxrees> .click(function() { alert('hello'); });
[18:21:36] <Gasher> ohhh, so you need to do 2 functions?
[18:21:46] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[18:21:59] <robertmaxrees> you could use .bind with alert
[18:22:37] <Gasher> well, that's weird
[18:22:39] <Gasher> thanks a lot
[18:22:47] <robertmaxrees> not really weird :) just the way the language works.
[18:22:47] <Gasher> I've been struggling with that for like past hour XD
[18:22:56] <robertmaxrees> keeps lots of other bits much simpler.
[18:23:07] <Gasher> I'm back to JS since today, and I already hate it ^^
[18:23:24] <robertmaxrees> nothing to hate :) what languages do you have experience with?
[18:24:05] <Gasher> Ruby Ruby Ruby
[18:24:09] <Gasher> and bit of everything
[18:24:10] <Gasher> and JS
[18:24:24] <robertmaxrees> ah, so you're grappling with callbacks.
[18:24:52] <Gasher> I used to do some JQuery magic
[18:25:06] <Gasher> but I got out of out practice
[18:25:20] <robertmaxrees> sure - just pointing out the keyword with where you're struggling in this case :)
[18:26:16] <Gasher> alright
[18:26:23] <Gasher> why is it that you need 2 functions?
[18:26:29] <Gasher> and is there a shorter way to do it?
[18:26:31] <robertmaxrees> >.> you don't.
[18:26:39] <robertmaxrees> you need to give it the function object.
[18:27:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/LL3k0v8p/
[18:27:47] <robertmaxrees> this is the other way to do it.
[18:27:59] <robertmaxrees> notice how you just pass foo without the parens?
[18:28:03] <robertmaxrees> that means you're handing it the object.
[18:28:09] <Gasher> well, I gave it an anonymous function, which then ran another function
[18:28:25] <robertmaxrees> sure, that's another way to do that - the anonymous function isn't being run immediately.
[18:28:35] <robertmaxrees> anonymous functions are like any other function object.
[18:28:49] <robertmaxrees> if you look at the fiddle i just shared, you'll get the idea.
[18:29:05] <Gasher> yeah, I tried to do it with an anonymous function before
[18:29:15] <Gasher> using these is what I remembered
[18:29:25] <robertmaxrees> .on('click', function() {}); is a pretty common pattern/
[18:29:29] <Gasher> but I tried to find a bug, found it, but I changed it to a normal function meanwhile
[18:29:42] <robertmaxrees> you changed it to a function call.
[18:29:45] <robertmaxrees> not a "normal function"
[18:29:56] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating a function object with a function call.
[18:30:24] <Gasher> okay
[18:30:27] <Gasher> well, it works now :D
[18:30:34] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:30:45] <taplar> understanding it is the important part though
[18:30:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[18:30:56] <robertmaxrees> helps you expand your understanding
[18:31:03] <robertmaxrees> and fwiw, JS and Ruby are pretty dissimilar.
[18:31:34] <Gasher> they are indeed robertmaxrees
[18:31:45] <Gasher> so what if I wanted to pass parameters to an anonymous function?
[18:31:53] <robertmaxrees> traditionally, you don't.
[18:32:18] <Gasher> gr8 ;_;
[18:32:26] <robertmaxrees> with things like handlers, you avoid passing parameters.  you might read from data attributes, or you might read properties off of your view or w/e
[18:32:37] <robertmaxrees> why would you need to pass params?
[18:32:51] <Gasher> no idea, just "what if"
[18:32:55] <Gasher> okay, well, I'll worry about it when I get to it
[18:33:09] <taplar> anonymous functions with provided arguments are more like closures
[18:33:15] <robertmaxrees> basically, you'd never really need to do that.  if you find yourself doing it, you've coded yourself into an awkward corner.
