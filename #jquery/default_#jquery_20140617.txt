[00:00:00] <Amnesia> hm ok, ty
[00:12:09] <DRSK> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/master/dist/jquery.boilerplate.js <-- how do I reference window? Says window and document are passed through as local variables rather than global, but I'm not sure how to access it or am I missing something?
[00:13:02] <systemfault> DRSK: You understand the concept of “variable shadowing” ?
[00:13:21] <DRSK> systemfault » not by name so I'm guessing I don't.
[00:14:14] <systemfault> DRSK: Within that IIFE,  if you use “window” variable, it will use local one instead of the global
[00:14:15] <DRSK> oh right so how do I shadow it?
[00:14:40] <Cork> DRSK: you don't they already did it for you
[00:15:00] <Cork> just access the variables normally
[00:15:02] <DRSK> well simply using "window" as is turns undefined
[00:15:22] <systemfault> unless you use node.js… window is ALWAYS defined.
[00:15:40] <Cork> DRSK: are you doing the last line in the file correctly?
[00:15:40] <DRSK> window.trigger('scroll'); <-- tried that in the init part of the boilerplate and it throws me the undefined thingy
[00:15:46] <DRSK> let me double check
[00:15:53] <systemfault> Normal… window isn’t a jQuery object.
[00:15:57] <Cork> ya
[00:16:11] <DRSK> })( jQuery, window, document );
[00:16:25] <systemfault> So it doesn’t have the jQuery stuff on it, use $(window) instead of window.
[00:16:50] <DRSK> Okay, so there's something I do not understand. Wouldn't $(window) 'grab' it again? i.e. using $(window) everywhere would 'retarget' it?
[00:17:05] <Cork> uh
[00:17:11] <DRSK> sure defining it somewhere as this.window or whatnot might help but I think I'm getting something backwards
[00:17:23] <Cork> DRSK: $() is a function that wraps the dom object you give it in a jquery object
[00:17:27] <Cork> it does't retarget anything
[00:18:15] <DRSK> So I'm mistaken in that defining it as perhaps this.window = $(window); would be preferable over writing $(window) for every occurrence I'd like to use this.window?
[00:18:38] <Cork> DRSK: it's an option yes
[00:19:56] <DRSK> Ok so I'm confused as sometimes I've found myself having to do $('.someClass') to get it 'updated' from the DOM if it has been altered after the first declaration
[00:20:22] <Cork> DRSK: that is a selector, not a dom element
[00:20:39] <DRSK> but thank you =) going to have to experiment a bit, I was afraid using $(window) would be overkill if it 'was already there'
[00:20:53] <DRSK> all right, confusion somewhat eased
[00:21:21] <Cork> DRSK: $() is an overloaded function
[00:21:36] <Cork> $(string) searches the document for elements matching it
[00:21:53] <Cork> $(domElement) wrapps the given object in jquery so you can use jquery functions on it
[00:22:09] <DRSK> ahh that clears it up
[00:22:26] <DRSK> If I had a hat I'd tip it, thanks again!
[00:22:31] <Cork> the reason you need to "refresh" the selector
[00:22:38] <Cork> is cause what dom elements match change
[00:23:00] <Cork> so the dom elements in the resulting jquery object isn't correct anymore
[00:23:56] <DRSK> right, when you put it like that it makes a lot of sense. It's like a small piece of puzzle just fell into place! I guess that's what you get when you learn by doing and not reading the terminology and theory behind it!
[00:24:42] <Cork> DRSK: i haven't read any books about jquery either :)
[00:25:04] <Cork> though reading the api.jquery.com is enough
[00:29:38] <DRSK> I'll make some time to go through the api, refresh and learn. I don't do JS or jQ enough to have had the time before but I kind of feel like I just need a few more pieces to the puzzle to see the bigger picture to "suffice" with what I know :p
[00:31:19] <DRSK> So yeah, as always Cork, the help is much appreciated. Thanks!

[01:41:31] <Somatt_wrk> hi
[01:42:58] <Somatt_wrk> anybody would know how to get a hold of the containing iframe in there parent context without a specific id? i.e. the same as iframeInParent = $('body', window.parent.document).find('#iframeId'); but without having an id
[01:44:15] <Somatt_wrk> anybody would know how to get a hold of the containing iframe in thee parent context without a specific id? i.e. the same as iframeInParent = $('body', window.parent.document).find('#iframeId'); but without having an id
[01:46:30] <Cork> Somatt_wrk: you might be able to do something horrible like window.parent.frames (loop) .document == document
[01:48:18] <chinoto> devil_: I thought I got disconnected after tomaw mentioned the split.
[01:48:51] <devil_> I figured that's why I ponged
[01:49:03] <chinoto> :)
[01:49:51] <chinoto> Anyway, I got two hours until I have to get ready for work, I'm going to bed (fortunately I had a 5 hour nap after work).

[03:32:13] <jop007> anyone using osx? How to do a file search and see the content of the search. Finder won't let you search the file
[04:12:21] <dki> how do you add header using $.post?  i know i can add headers: in $.ajax
[04:12:32] <dki> i do this for $.post(url, data) ....
[04:13:06] <Cork> dki: $.post and $.gat is shorthand functions
[04:13:14] <Cork> you can only do the most common things that way
[04:13:16] <Axman6> just use $.ajax
[04:13:27] <dki> ah so no way to add header via shorthand functions
[04:13:29] <Cork> so you need to use $.ajax if you want to set headers
[04:13:49] <Cork> dki: honestly i don't see much point in $.post and $.get
[04:13:52] <dki> do you think it's reasonable to actually make them avaiaible to shorthand?
[04:13:58] <dki> Cork:  well just fewer typing
[04:14:13] <Cork> $.post(url).done() vs $.ajax(url, { type: "post" }).done()
[04:14:16] <Cork> not much difference
[04:15:19] <dki> Cork:  thats fair :)
[04:15:21] <dki> thanks though!
[05:00:57] <Amnesia> question, I've bound a handler to the change event on a datepicker instance, but when I use "onSelect" the change event doesn't seem to be triggered anymore. What's causing this behaviour?
[05:04:47] <jemendja> hi
[05:06:18] <jemendja> hello
[05:32:21] <ruby_on_tails> currently i have a code on line #1 http://pastebin.com/iJFYZPyG is it possible to shorten it to something like line #2 ?
[06:01:34] <DRSK> Cork » I'm comparing an offset().top of an image towards the $(window).scrollTop(). The closer I get to the image being to the top the smaller the value (closed to 0) I get. Can I in some way reverse this so instead of going from say 100 to 0, have it go from 0 to 100?
[06:02:15] <seutje> DRSK: sure, but then I suppose you'd need to define a fixed value
[06:02:26] <DRSK> I've Math.min and Math.maxed it to be between 100 and 0, but the value goes from 100 to 0 instad of the other way around
[06:02:36] <DRSK> seutje » do tell :) what do you mean?
[06:03:06] <seutje> well yeah, if u wanna go from somewhere to 0, you need to know where somewhere is
[06:03:14] <seutje> but I guess it's a fixed 100px in this case?
[06:03:37] <DRSK> seutje » in theory, it is. It'd be 100px before the top of the image hits the top of the window. That's where I'd like it to be 0
[06:03:49] <seutje> so basically, just calculate the value as before, and subtract it from 100?
[06:04:01] <DRSK> when the image hits the window top, that's when I want it to be 100. Or actually 0 and 1 but yeah.
[06:04:06] <seutje> so zhere it used to be 20 -> 100 - 20
[06:04:07] <DRSK> hm
[06:04:09] <seutje> where
[06:04:36] <seutje> do you actually want offset().top to return that? cause that seems rather nasty and prone to break other things
[06:05:23] <DRSK> How could I not see this, hang on..
[06:05:36] <DRSK> yes you're right, I've missed it completely. Thank you seutje lol
[06:06:12] <seutje> problem is that u'll have an implied fixed value
[06:06:22] <seutje> unless that's not a problem ofc :D
[06:13:24] <DRSK> seutje » it's not, I was just having a really hard time wrapping my head around something I felt to be so easy but I couldn't figure it out.. it has been nagging me for quite some time. And you simply just say -100 and save my day.
[06:13:53] <uskerine> hi, if you are passing some arguments in a GET method, and one of the arguments has an '&', how can you pass it without breaking any stuff?
[06:14:53] <conner> think you need to urlencode the parameters u pass as arguments
[06:15:21] <conner> that would be replacing & with %26
[06:15:39] <uskerine> understood. this might be a bit offtopic but, is there any command line tool that you can use to urlencode characters?
[06:15:45] <uskerine> -in linux-
[06:15:58] <uskerine> I am doing some server stuff with wget
[06:17:30] <conner> guess it varies based on linux distro and programs install, try: man urlencode
[06:18:39] <silverdust> what the difference between declaring a variable as var variable = 'foo'; and variable = 'foo';
[06:19:46] <chinoto> silverdust: scope
[06:20:23] <silverdust> but both works fine
[06:20:32] <chinoto> potentially.
[06:20:37] <conner> if in a function using var will make it local variable
[06:21:02] <chinoto> silverdust: If you are using var inside a function, the variable will only exist within the function and any descendant function, if you set a variable outside a function, regardless of var, it will be global.
[06:21:07] <silverdust> i.e it doesn't come out of that function
[06:21:35] <chinoto> Though there are potentially discrepancies between browsers.
[06:21:46] <silverdust> ok thanks chinoto
[06:21:54] <chinoto> silverdust: It's best to use var unless you have a reason to make something global.
[06:22:26] <chinoto> And generally if you need something global, I would say you're not wrapping enough of the code inside a function.
[06:24:12] <gingitsune> Can someone please help me figure out how to change jQuery ui autcomplete results classes. The website I'm working has a customezed autocomplete and allraedy has a styled dropdown. I'd like to change the classes to match to that of the established styles
[06:24:21] <conner> hi, i've made a jquery UI widget that i instanciate dynamically (using ajax) and insert into a jquery.jscrollpane. When scrollpane is instanciated it set its height to 0 based on innerHeight. I want to reinitialize/resize the scrollpane after inserting my widgets, anyone know how to call the reinitialise on jscrollpane?
[06:26:41] <chinoto> uskerine: You could use some programming language and do it like this: echo http://example.com/?`php -r 'echo http_build_query(["a"=>"Hello&good morning","b"=>"Mr. Moto"]);'` > http://example.com/?a=Hello%26good+morning&b=Mr.+Moto
[06:26:47] <chinoto> hmm
[06:27:25] <chinoto> Kinda sucks that http_build_query uses the older encoding :/
[06:36:35] <conner> to previous question: i have tried something like this, is this bad jquery code? $('.scrollbox').JScrollPane("reinitialise", $.fn.jScrollPane.defaults);
[06:39:16] <chinoto> ew
[06:40:01] <chinoto> The plugin should be doing something like $.extend({},$.fn.jScrollPane.defaults,user_input)
[06:40:08] <chinoto> conner: ^
[06:41:57] <conner> ye, it has this code: settings = $.extend({}, $.fn.jScrollPane.defaults, settings); but when this is initialized first time there are no elements in the scrollbox, they are loaded afterwards so i need to reinitialize it
[06:42:50] <conner> it has a function:   $.extend(jsp, {reinitialise: function(s) {  ......   but not sure how to call it
[06:45:37] <chinoto> Oh, sorry, in that case I have no idea, I thought you passing the defaults as the sole argument.
[06:46:37] <chinoto> Actually, have you tried just "$('.scrollbox').JScrollPane('reinitialise',{});"?
[06:47:07] <chinoto> Seems like the most obvious way to go.
[06:47:13] <conner> ye, getting undefined is not a function
[06:47:23] <chinoto> O_o
[06:48:24] <chinoto> Is there anything that they require you to pass when doing the initialization? $('.scrollbox').JScrollPane({?:?})
[06:48:37] <conner> nah
[06:48:49] <chinoto> huh, well that's weird
[06:49:11] <chinoto> I'd say dive in the code, fix it, and submit a patch to them.
[06:49:28] <chinoto> It seems like the problem is simple, then again, maybe not.
[06:49:46] <conner> hehe, i'll try but only been using jquery for 3 days, a bit hard to read
[06:50:32] <chinoto> Well it's not like you have to look at the whole thing, just scrollpane.
[06:58:04] <conner> ya, got it to work: $('.scrollbox').data('jsp').reinitialise($.fn.jScrollPane.defaults);
[07:05:35] <jessica583> how can i make this scroll to about 20px higher than where it currently goes to ? http://hastebin.com/udevivorob.coffee
[07:06:16] <BillCriswell> jessica583: subtract 20 from $target.offset().top
[07:08:23] <jessica583> (($target.offset().top)-20) BillCriswell  ?
[07:11:07] <abishek> does setting the source of an image using $(image).attr('src','url_to_image'); call the onload event of the image?
[07:11:14] <BillCriswell> jessica583:That could work, but just $target.offset().top - 20 could also work.
[07:11:59] <Cork> abishek: it does in some browsers
[07:12:06] <Cork> abishek: but specifically not in webkit
[07:12:22] <abishek> ok, what should be an ideal way to fix this?
[07:12:38] <Cork> abishek: create a new img element and replaceWith
[07:13:13] <Cork> abishek: webkit only fires the onload event once for img elements for some reason.
[07:13:37] <abishek> Cork, what do you mean by replaceWith
[07:13:43] <Cork> ?replaceWith
[07:13:56] * Cork pokes b-ot 
[07:14:07] <Cork> ?g api.jquery.com replaceWith
[07:14:08] <b-ot> Cork: .replaceWith() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[07:15:32] <jessica583> BillCriswell: that doesn't seem to change anything
[07:15:39] <abishek> Cork, oh ok
[07:19:51] <kk_drop> wich event would be best to catch all form input foucus - input text, select, checkbox - so I could stop action (preventDefault) if I need to?
[07:24:15] <tw2113> submit ?
[07:24:21] <kk_drop> and I would like to prevent changing field
[07:25:08] <kk_drop> no, I would like to call some custom function when focus on element and prevent other actions (like changing, insterting text into text elemnt, changing selcets, checking checkboxes etc)
[07:25:45] <jamiesinclair> Hi all, this is an indirectly jQuery related question. I'm using phpMyAdmin, but on the login page, jquery is failing to load properly. I know a decent amount about JavaScript...but I can't figure this out. Would someone be able to look at this with me? I can post a link.
[07:31:00] <jamiesinclair> @kk_drop do you have a jsfiddle up? (I just joined a few minutes ago).
[07:36:36] <obert> my script stopped working right now! :(
[07:37:01] <drej> obert that bastard!
[07:37:22] <obert> :)
[07:38:16] <chinoto> What was the name of the guy who changed his name to dach_lunch yesterday?
[07:38:41] <obert> it is really weird, I left it locally untouched per months and now that I launched it, it doesn't works
[07:41:29] <decx> chinoto you mean duch_kazatel who will arrive in approximately 1,5 hours at work
[07:42:12] <chinoto> Odd, I though the second part was 4 characters.
[07:42:24] <chinoto> thought*
[07:42:33] <decx> memory is a fickle thing
[07:42:45] <chinoto> Especially mine.
[07:43:47] <bigwax_> I have a div img where I fade it out, change the src, then fade it back in. It works on desktop but not on mobile (it will just fade out and then back in as the same image)
[07:43:54] <bigwax_> is this a known problem?
[07:44:45] <chinoto> bigwax_: Try using replaceWith, someone mentioned it worked better for another use case.
[07:45:02] <bigwax_> i'll look into it, thanks
[07:45:07] <bigwax_> any idea why it's happening though?
[07:45:14] * chinoto shrugs
[07:45:19] <decx> change prop('src') instead of attr('src')
[07:45:22] <chinoto> crappy implementation?
[07:45:41] <chinoto> decx: That would make sense.
[07:45:46] <Amnesia> question, is there some way to execute stuff that's defined in "onSelect" on jquery's datepicker to be executed when the datepicker get's initialized?
[07:45:55] <Xal_> I'm using the UI slider widget, and for some reason it isn't animating. The click and mousemove triggers are returning the proper values, but the indicator elements aren't moving to where the mouse is. They are just staying on the left edge of the slider bar.
[07:46:06] <chinoto> I would normally do that, I wonder if that's what the other guy's problem was.
[07:46:10] <Amnesia> the reason I'm asking, is because I'm trying to get the datepicker to highlight an entire week, and the select the first day of that week
[07:46:29] <chinoto> Amnesia: trigger()?
[07:47:37] <Amnesia> chinoto: https://privatepaste.com/60408ee384
[07:47:48] <chinoto> I just realized that's rather useless.
[07:48:09] <Amnesia> I'm reading into trigger()'s description as we speak..
[07:48:32] <chinoto> Datepicker doesn't have any normal events :/ http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[07:48:33] <Amnesia> hm nope, don't think this is what I'm looking for
[07:48:46] <chinoto> I wonder if it's possible at all.
[07:49:03] <Amnesia> well, the posted code does work when I manually select a date
[07:49:32] <Xal_> For the record, this is in the timepicker extension for the datepicker widget.
[07:49:43] <Amnesia> let me have a look..
[07:50:24] <Xal_> http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[07:51:22] <Xal_> Both Firefox and Chrome
[07:53:11] <chinoto> Back to no channel blinker.
[07:53:48] <Amnesia> Xal_: where were you able to find anything regarding selecting a week?
[07:54:50] <Xal_> No. I wasn't really looking for that.
[07:55:32] <Amnesia> from what I can see it doesn't support such a thing
[07:55:46] <Amnesia> It might be my blindness though:)
[07:56:08] <Xal_> Shouldn't be difficult to implement.
[07:56:34] <Xal_> It would just return an int, right? The week number of the year?
[07:57:15] <BillCriswell> jessica583: It should. Do you have a demo?
[07:57:18] <Amnesia> well, I've already implemented it with the vanilla datepicker
[07:57:28] <antlong> good morning, how can i get this filter to work properly? http://jsfiddle.net/U8T8p/180/
[07:57:36] <Amnesia> but that's only possible using the onSelect event
[07:57:55] <Xal_> Can someone help me to get these sliders working properly?
[07:57:56] <Amnesia> which means I've got to select it manually, and I need it to select the first day of the week at initialization
[07:58:30] <quarier> hello, i'm not sure about how functions in jquery works, when i'm clicking on a link on my webpage, i have a redirection to another page of this website. I want to use jquery on this new page when the link is clicked on the previous one. is something like this supposed to work ?  http://puu.sh/9xAbV/41b88a47ac.png
[07:59:27] <Xal_> No JS errors, either.
[08:01:46] <BillCriswell> jessica583: http://jsbin.com/ziseworu/7/edit?html,css,js,output here is a demo i did for someone a little white ago. Might help.
[08:03:34] <BillCriswell> quarier: You can't run a script from the last page you were on.
[08:03:59] <decx> bro do you even quick return pattern, fixed nav is so 2012
[08:04:19] <BillCriswell> Haha... think I did that too somewhere?
[08:04:52] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/xilekeqo/6/edit mwhaahah
[08:05:23] <quarier> BillCriswell: so there is no way i can modify something in a page when clicking to a link to trigger the js / redirection in another one ?
[08:06:22] <decx> hehe
[08:06:32] <decx> well good morning at any rate ;)
[08:06:40] <BillCriswell> Yes, yes, good
[08:06:45] <BillCriswell> morning to you too
[08:07:00] <decx> "morning"
[08:07:14] <decx> i'm cooking dinner atm
[08:07:21] <BillCriswell> quarier: I just want to clarify. You want to have a script on page A, then when you click a link to page B you want the script from A to run on B?
[08:07:35] <BillCriswell> Dinner sounds good.
[08:07:40] <BillCriswell> decx: What are you having
[08:07:52] <jenia> hello
[08:08:06] <jenia> i have a ul data-role="listview"
[08:08:40] <decx> jagdwurst with bellpeppers in arrabatia sauce with pasta
[08:08:51] <jenia> when i call $(mylist).listview(), the function kind of rerenders the list, put some lines in it and thats it
[08:09:01] <quarier> BillCriswell: ahm ... when i click on a link on a page A , i want it to change a property on an element in the page B
[08:09:33] <BillCriswell> Did page A spawn this window and it is the same domain?
[08:09:39] <jenia> it doesnt make the inputs to be the whole length of the list and it doesnt but the little triangles on the side of the list
[08:09:50] <jenia> any idea how can i do it a little better?
[08:10:04] <Xal_> Firebug is showing that the "left" attribute of the slider handle is changing, but it appears to stay in the same place.
[08:10:21] <quarier> when I click on the element that triggers on a page A (link) it goes to the page B instead of the page A (no new window). and yeah same domain i assume.
[08:10:28] <Cork> Xal_: your most likely missing the jquery ui css for the slider
[08:10:30] <decx> why is mine so much longer BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7Hv2X/
[08:11:08] <Cork> Xal_: the effect you see is quite common if position: relative; (or was it absolute) is missing in the handle
[08:11:17] <BillCriswell> decx: Does this work?
[08:11:26] <antlong> Can someone help me make my filter work please :) http://jsfiddle.net/U8T8p/184/
[08:12:01] <decx> i never tested it thoroughly or in production but it does work
[08:12:20] <quarier> BillCriswell > sorry to repost not sure you've seen x: when I click on the element that triggers on a page A (link) it goes to the page B instead of the page A (no new window). and yeah same domain i assume.
[08:13:05] <decx> it's doing the same thing too, just the $.fn. overhead
[08:13:11] <decx> good ^^
[08:13:49] <BillCriswell> decx: I dunno haha
[08:14:37] <Xal_> Yeah, that'd be it, then
[08:15:12] <BillCriswell> quarier: You probably want to pass something in the URL since it's in the same domain. Javascript won't load scripts from previous pages, thank god.
[08:15:29] <antlong> return regex.test($('span', this).text());  - what do you put (where span is), to denote text? It's the equivalent of . or text()
[08:15:51] <Cork> BillCriswell: well it is actively blocked, but it was possible back in the 90's :)
[08:16:47] <bberry> antlong: http://jsfiddle.net/U8T8p/185/
[08:17:20] <bberry> never used indexOf that way before haha
[08:17:52] <BillCriswell> That's weird haha.
[08:17:56] <BillCriswell> Cork: Haha good!
[08:18:02] <antlong> bberry you're the man! how do I make it case-insensitive?
[08:18:06] <decx> hey i did that just the other day bberry http://jsfiddle.net/decx/ku6yN/
[08:18:13] <BillCriswell> I abuse CSS when I want to filter.
[08:18:21] <bberry> antlong sec
[08:18:22] <decx> antlong mine is sort of
[08:18:48] <antlong> decx thats really cool
[08:19:01] <bberry> antlong: http://jsfiddle.net/U8T8p/186/
[08:19:30] <bberry> decx: no i meant adding 1 to the indexOf
[08:19:37] <antlong> thanks a lot bberry
[08:19:39] <bberry> np np
[08:20:14] <bberry> decx: just because indexOf can return 0 as an index (the first letter in the string), but return -1 as a 'not found'
[08:20:22] <bberry> so if you add 1, you can make it truthy/falsy
[08:21:04] <bberry> i guess you could also just do > = or !== -1 like you did haha
[08:21:26] <bberry> antlong: probably better and less confusing to do it that way actually ^^^
[08:21:40] <decx> doesnt really matter which way oyu go you need the invert of the filter anyway to either hide or show
[08:21:52] <decx> good old .not
[08:22:00] <bberry> yeah
[08:22:32] <bberry> sometimes i think i should learn regex
[08:22:39] <bberry> then i find other ways to get around it haha
[08:22:55] <BillCriswell> bberry: That's good.
[08:22:57] <bberry> luckily i havent had to do any complex string parsing.... yet.
[08:24:58] <BillCriswell> It's fun the first few times.
[08:26:16] <BillCriswell> It goes downhill quickly.
[08:29:02] <BillCriswell> What the hell am I doing wrong. Wanted to set up a filter demo and it's failing on me haha
[08:29:45] <thebope> rtfm BillCriswell
[08:29:50] <thebope> ;-)
[08:30:00] <BillCriswell> I tried. ='(
[08:30:09] <decx> good old morning brain deficiency
[08:30:12] <thebope> I jest, thats my only response because I feel like you're tremendously better at jquery
[08:30:56] <thebope> Why's it failing?
[08:30:58] <thebope> I'd look
[08:31:32] <BillCriswell> I only seem like I know what I'm talking about in here.
[08:31:40] <thebope> haha, I guess that's me too
[08:31:51] <BillCriswell> Think my CSS selector is bad.
[08:31:52] <thebope> I've been meaning to read the whole of Jquery documentation
[08:32:08] <decx> that's why i just lurk when there's a real problem discussed in the channel
[08:32:19] <decx> people would be like: you're out of your element decxy
[08:32:29] <thebope> I always try to beat duch to the .length answers
[08:32:29] <BillCriswell> li[data-text*=foo] should match any li with data-attr="whateverfoowhatever"
[08:32:55] <BillCriswell> "Look at your console for an error." is my go to.
[08:32:58] <bberry> decx, thebope: lol, im glad im not alone in this
[08:32:59] <BillCriswell> That and filter() vs find()
[08:33:08] <thebope> hahaha bberry
[08:33:31] <BillCriswell> Ok, I am definitely messing up this selector.
[08:34:08] <sacho> the selector being?
[08:34:10] <thebope> data-text*="foo" would be attribute contains
[08:34:13] <BillCriswell> Can you use attribute selectors in CSS with data attributes? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.
[08:34:26] <decx> sure you cam
[08:34:31] <thebope> yea I think so
[08:34:43] <thebope> I think it's like anything inline, no?
[08:34:48] <thebope> and by inline
[08:34:54] <thebope> I just mean, in the line, with the tag
[08:34:55] <decx> i prefer a filter with data though
[08:35:26] <sacho> BillCriswell, are you sure you have a data attribute on that element?
[08:35:52] <BillCriswell> sacho: Yes. Setting it with .attr('data-attr') and I see it in the DOM.
[08:36:13] <sacho> a test case, perhaps?
[08:36:15] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/fatos/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:36:39] <BillCriswell> I know it's going to be something dumb.
[08:36:56] <BillCriswell> quotes.
[08:36:58] <BillCriswell> Fucker.
[08:37:03] <thebope> haha
[08:37:07] <thebope> I used quotes up top
[08:37:25] <thebope> I had the idea that you could do things like that, but that's awesome
[08:37:32] <thebope> I'm definitely going to use selectors in my CSS more often
[08:38:06] <BillCriswell> It's finally OK to do.
[08:38:17] <BillCriswell> I wanted to do it for years, but IE was so slow to catch up.
[08:38:28] <BillCriswell> I forget I Can use inline-block reliably now.
[08:40:41] <BillCriswell> decx: http://jsbin.com/fatos/2/edit?output that feels quick.
[08:41:34] <decx> seems ridiculous
[08:42:05] <BillCriswell> Agreed... but it feels quick haha
[08:42:41] <decx> it's certainly inventive
[08:43:17] <decx> probably much faster than going through a long list of items
[08:48:34] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed.
[08:48:35] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/fatos/3/edit haha
[08:49:00] <decx> i hope you generated that ^^
[08:49:17] <BillCriswell> Haha say what.
[08:50:40] <decx> the football is starting again in 10 minutes get hyped
[08:50:54] <thebope> thats the goal these days
[08:50:58] <decx> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF_uOgyBK1c
[08:51:12] <thebope> I dunno what it is about football, I just can't put a finger on it
[08:51:53] <thebope> ugh, too bad I'll be over here at work working on my header
[08:51:58] <Hyperking> when using .html() how do i specify a particular element and not just the immediate child element?
[08:52:00] <BillCriswell> thebope: Are you American?
[08:52:04] <thebope> BillCriswell, haha, yea
[08:52:16] <BillCriswell> Well, you can put your finger on football in that case haha.
[08:52:22] <thebope> hahahaha
[08:52:28] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking by targeting that element first?  mind clarifying your question?
[08:52:59] <BillCriswell> Hyperking: You don't target elements with .html. I think you're looking for .find()?
[08:53:11] <fullhdpixel> Can someone check what is wrong with this Jquery code? http://pastebin.com/e1h90bV1
[08:53:28] <decx> html just outputs the html of the first item in a collection, just as text, attr and some others
[08:53:40] <BillCriswell> fullhdpixel: You're not preventDefault()ing the event.
[08:54:01] <fullhdpixel> im totally new to that concept, BillCriswell
[08:54:04] <Hyperking> BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/HQhzr/82/ I think your right. i will try
[08:54:13] <BillCriswell> fullhdpixel: Also, the onclick in there is not needed.
[08:54:29] <fullhdpixel> well, it works now
[08:54:33] <fullhdpixel> thanks XD
[08:54:35] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/HQhzr/82/
[08:54:45] <BillCriswell> fullhdpixel: Think you would like $('.nav a').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); $('.nav a').removeClass('active'); $(this).addClass('active'); });
[08:54:47] <Hyperking> line 255
[08:55:06] <BillCriswell> Thnk you want like*
[08:55:24] <fullhdpixel> BillCriswell, yes works great
[08:55:39] <fullhdpixel> Thanks a lot
[08:55:46] <BillCriswell> fullhdpixel: No problem.
[08:56:08] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking that doesn't make any sense.  .html() gets the html() of a node - you're getting a specific attribute and then trying to run .html() on it. are you trying to get the html of something brough in via that ajax call?
[08:57:09] <duch_kazatel> Hyperking i'm guessing this is closer to what you want: http://jsfiddle.net/HQhzr/83/
[08:57:22] <Psybur> Is it possible to implement something like a servletfilter for incoming rest responses?
[08:57:25] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: i want to ajax a page, but not the entire html
[08:57:44] <BillCriswell> .load() will take a selector after the url.
[08:57:56] <duch_kazatel> $( "#result" ).load( "ajax/test.html #container" ); like this
[08:58:33] <Hyperking> duch_kazatel: aha! thats it, thank you and BillCriswell
[08:59:15] <minato> someone help me i have designed jquery mobile site, when i convert it into app for android using phonegap the images gets elongated i.e stretched like this http://tinypic.com/r/2easyo4/8    and this is the code i have used to implement that part   http://pastebin.com/de7LAeXC
[09:12:46] <decx> who is going to get anything from that?
[09:13:04] <decx> my guess is you have some position absolute nonsense for you no-pad class going on
[09:13:13] <duch_kazatel> "hey guys here's my question it has nothing to do with jquery or javascript really it's phonegap here's some html thx"
[09:13:59] <decx> somebody was looking for you earlier duch_kazatel
[09:14:06] <duch_kazatel> oh really?
[09:14:10] <decx> chinpokemon?
[09:14:13] <decx> chinoto
[09:14:18] <duch_kazatel> oh that dude?
[09:14:39] <chinoto> Oh hi
[09:14:49] <duch_kazatel> whuddup duder
[09:15:18] <chinoto> I was just wondering for when/if I find information on event handlers, I've been working on other stuff.
[09:15:41] <duch_kazatel> you got mad at me yesterday, so i'm not sure why you'd want my help today ;)
[09:16:06] <chinoto> Heh? You said you wanted to know about any info I found :/
[09:16:24] <duch_kazatel> kay
[09:16:36] <duch_kazatel> i was wondering if you'd made any progress is all.
[09:16:56] <chinoto> As I said, been working on other stuff.
[09:17:06] <chinoto> Right now, it's dealing with tab order.
[09:17:23] <duch_kazatel> let me clarify - i was trying to help you again yesterday.  that's all.  but good times either way.
[09:17:48] <chinoto> You already said that, no need to worry.
[09:17:51] <thebope> Does anyone here work for jquery? I know its moderated by them?
[09:17:55] <thebope> I'm worried
[09:17:57] <thebope> I'm a bit worried
[09:18:14] <BillCriswell> thebope: About what? lol
[09:18:16] <duch_kazatel> thebope there are some mods around - did you need to talk about this room?  or about jquery proper?
[09:18:39] <thebope> whats jquery proper?
[09:18:43] <chinoto> Coworker decided to do float:right, I'll probably turn it into a display:table(-cell).
[09:18:45] <duch_kazatel> the library itself.
[09:18:55] <thebope> No I was just curious. I heard the mods are here. But I haven't like, known if any of them talk?
[09:19:08] <chinoto> thebope: What is your question?
[09:19:22] <thebope> Erm, I don't have any, just wanted to say thanks for jquery
[09:19:27] <chinoto> oh...
[09:19:27] <thebope> I feel like I've summoned a god
[09:19:34] <thebope> And now I have no wish
[09:19:44] <Jattenalle> aaw :)
[09:19:55] <thebope> Thats really cool
[09:20:00] <thebope> It's a great library. I use it a lot
[09:20:02] <Jattenalle> also morning folk
[09:20:05] <BillCriswell> thebope: https://jquery.org/team/
[09:20:30] <duch_kazatel> hahahah - you can also run /msg chanserv access list #jquery for a list of mods.  #jquery-dev is where the actual developers hang out.
[09:20:34] * decx is humming the golden girls theme
[09:20:35] <chinoto> thebope: I thought you had a question that you thought only a dev could answer.
[09:20:55] <BillCriswell> There's a few of them always aroudn haah. Don't want to mention their names for no reason in case they're busy, though.
[09:21:03] <thebope> No, I'm not at the level yet chinoto
[09:21:07] <thebope> It's cool you guys are here
[09:21:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is good people.
[09:21:17] <thebope> yea he is
[09:21:23] <Jattenalle> duch_kazatel is bad people.
[09:21:24] <Jattenalle> ?
[09:21:25] <Jattenalle> ;)
[09:21:25] <thebope> I feel like most of the regulars here
[09:21:29] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[09:21:31] <thebope> are
[09:21:36] <BillCriswell> Just don't want them being like "WTF DO YOU WANT BILL"
[09:21:43] <chinoto> ajpian0, scott_gonzales, vladikof
[09:21:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm the resident cranky wiseass.
[09:21:58] <thebope> I'm turning into the resident amateur
[09:22:09] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell is the dude who always says "Oh I just did something like that here's the jsbin for it"
[09:22:11] <thebope> still trying to beat you to a .length question duch_kazatel
[09:22:28] <duch_kazatel> shoky and decx are the ones that make me feel like a raging newb generally.
[09:23:12] <thebope> Well everyone on jquery team, it's cool to... e-meet you. It's probably a blast working on jquery.
[09:23:37] <decx> i just touched myself while reading that
[09:23:45] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:23:45] <thebope> hahahaha
[09:24:11] * chinoto has been touching himself the whole time...
[09:24:38] <bberry> cannot unread...
[09:24:55] <thebope> cannot stand up...
[09:24:56] <chinoto> No amount of babbling can repeal what I have said :D
[09:25:08] <chinoto> Err.
[09:25:20] <chinoto> What has been said cannot be unsaid.
[09:25:52] <thebope> There will be my life before this conversation... and my life after
[09:25:59] <duch_kazatel> it has been logged for all posterity.
[09:26:15] <thebope> posteriority
[09:26:32] <duch_kazatel> posterior
[09:31:09] <ul71m0> hi im having issue in centering tooltip on this slider http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/128/ to be in middle of handles
[09:31:25] * chinoto rubs le posterior
[09:33:25] <thebope> ul71m0, wouldn't your values need to be equidistant from either side?
[09:34:02] <thebope> if you change the values from 150 to 200, and 300 to 400, it's centered
[09:34:28] <thebope> I think tooltip is a particular plugin no? I don't see it on here anywhere
[09:34:44] <ul71m0> well yes that is what im trying to do, just dunno how
[09:35:03] <AusME> I am attempting to add elements from an array of elements into a drop down list. Please see code here http://pastebin.com/FC1X2HS1
[09:35:30] <AusME> I've verified that the array does have data.
[09:36:09] <thebope> ahh I thought you meant the slider itself initially
[09:36:23] <thebope> maybe add a tooltip and then put another demo for us?
[09:37:07] <ul71m0> thebope: im trying to recreate example #2 from this page http://seiyria.github.io/bootstrap-slider/
[09:37:22] <ul71m0> thebope: there you can see tooltip is in the middle of the slected area
[09:38:03] <thebope> ul71m0, I don't see you importing that library anywhere?
[09:39:28] <ul71m0> im not, that one have bug, so im trying to create same with jquery ui, if you open that example #2 in safari and move your mouse up/down while pressed on handle it highlights are and client reported that as a bug
[09:39:35] <ul71m0> thebope: ^^
[09:40:33] <thebope> ul71m0, did you look at the source?
[09:40:39] <thebope> Sorry I'm at work
[09:42:09] <ul71m0> thebope: its too much for me, not in knowledge to debug that one, so i figured out its maybe easier to just create new one.
[09:43:56] <jenia> hello
[09:44:08] <ul71m0> thebope: i raised issue here https://github.com/seiyria/bootstrap-slider/issues/151
[09:45:07] <silverdust> I have a json object being sent from a backend like so {"message":"it worked"}
[09:45:09] <duch_kazatel> isn't there a bootstrap channel?
[09:45:16] <silverdust> as a response from a ajax form submission
[09:45:26] <silverdust> how do I log this
[09:45:34] <silverdust> It just displays object object
[09:45:43] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ silverdust
[09:45:43] <b-ot> silverdust: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:47:17] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: here http://jsbin.com/huhocuvu/1/edit
[09:47:21] <chinoto> How do I get better debugging with jquery? All I'm getting is stuff like this: 11:41:09.663 Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/ jquery.min.js:4
[09:47:37] <silverdust> response gives object in the console log
[09:47:47] <chinoto> Btw, does anyone know how to deal with that error, I searched my codebase, we're not using async anywhere.
[09:48:18] <duch_kazatel> silverdust just console.log(response) - you're trying to concat a complex object to a string.
[09:48:40] <silverdust> ok
[09:48:40] <duch_kazatel> silverdust also, if you're using a reasonably recent version of jquery, use .done() and .fail() instead of success and error.
[09:49:09] <chinoto> I even tried searching for 'sync', but that doesn't turn up anything that would affect the page.
[09:49:25] <silverdust> yea I use 2.1.1 I think that's recent enough?
[09:49:38] <duch_kazatel> silverdust yep.
[09:50:12] <duch_kazatel> chinoto using ajax anywhere?
[09:50:33] <chinoto> Plenty, but doesn't jquery default to async?
[09:51:11] <islalobo> If I have a toggled list, can I add an animation or image with javascript? Or is that done by css? What I did was add toggleClass and was going to add css accordingly. Is there another way to do that?
[09:51:15] <duch_kazatel> it should, chinoto
[09:51:24] <chinoto> :/
[09:51:48] <duch_kazatel> islalobo whosawhatnow?
[09:53:19] <thebope> ul71m0, sorry was in a quick meeting
[09:53:33] <chinoto> I guess I could just put random returns in my script to see when Firefox starts complaining.
[09:53:45] <duch_kazatel> chinoto you could also use the step debugger.
[09:54:00] <antlong> if i append a form input, and i see its below all of the other content even though i appended it first, what can i do to move it to the first element?
[09:54:19] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: It isn't throwing an exception though :/
[09:54:37] <duch_kazatel> chinoto doesn't need to - step through until you see the error hit.
[09:54:50] <chinoto> hm
[09:54:51] <duch_kazatel> antlong you mean you want to .prepend() it instead?
[09:55:05] <ul71m0> thebope: np, so i just need to center this tooltip in middle of selected area http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/136/
[09:55:12] <antlong> duch_kazatel  is applying the wrong style and class and such
[09:55:17] <antlong> duch_kazatel would before() be suitable?
[09:55:28] <duch_kazatel> antlong huh?
[09:55:36] <duch_kazatel> antlong your initial question seems off to me.
[09:55:44] <antlong> duch_kazatel when i prepend it, the form takes on the style of the accordian its supposed to be above
[09:56:26] <duch_kazatel> .prepend() shouldn't change your css.  sounds like you're targeting something funky...
[09:56:56] <antlong> i think it's written in such a way that there is only one element, and that is the accordian element
[09:57:14] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: should it be like this with done() and fail() http://jsbin.com/huhocuvu/1/edit
[09:57:20] <duch_kazatel> I'd need to see your code to understand what's going on, antlong
[09:57:44] <duch_kazatel> silverdust http://jsbin.com/huhocuvu/2/edit
[09:57:46] <duch_kazatel> like this.
[09:58:03] <duch_kazatel> woops small error in there.
[09:58:05] <antlong> duch_kazatel sorry its gross.  https://dpaste.de/QPOE
[09:58:20] <thebope> i wish I could like inspect that element ul71m0
[09:58:38] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Odd, it's apparently only happening on one page, I guess we could be using async after all.
[09:58:39] <duch_kazatel> silverdust http://jsbin.com/huhocuvu/3/edit there we go.
[09:58:49] <chinoto> I mean sync
[09:58:56] <chinoto> or async:false...
[09:59:00] <chinoto> gah
[09:59:08] <silverdust> so it's outside the ajax function
[09:59:34] <duch_kazatel> silverdust they're chained on to it, yeah.
[09:59:38] <antlong> duch_kazatel, whatever i modified before i pasted seemed to have put it above the accordion
[09:59:42] <silverdust> ok thanks
[09:59:42] <antlong> so no worries i guess
[09:59:53] <duch_kazatel> brb meeting.
[10:00:27] <thebope> ul71m0, did you look at this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3342222/jquery-trying-to-center-tooltip-over-hovered-element
[10:00:36] <thebope> I gotta eat, be back in a bit
[10:00:57] <buddyq> duch_kazatel:  Thanks for yesterday! It worked.
[10:01:51] <ul71m0> thebope: i`ll take a look
[10:06:58] <ADuquet> I am a newbie to both jquery and IRC. Can someone please let me know if you see this question?
[10:07:37] <duch_kazatel> ADuquet i can see it.
[10:07:43] <ADuquet> awesome, thanks!
[10:12:01] <silverdust> duch_kazatel: in this var template = $('#' + $(this).data('section'));
[10:12:08] <silverdust> what does data() do?
[10:14:15] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery data
[10:14:16] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jQuery.data() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[10:14:18] <duch_kazatel> :)\
[10:14:50] <silverdust> tnx
[10:15:19] <duch_kazatel> silverdust it reads data attributes/other data attached to nodes.
[10:15:25] * silverdust thinks he is beginning to DDOS duch_kazatel with Thanks?
[10:15:31] <silverdust> :)
[10:15:32] <duch_kazatel> not yet ;)
[10:16:12] <ADuquet> Duch, doesnt data need 3 inputs (element, key, value)? What happens when only one input is supplied here?
[10:16:22] <duch_kazatel> $(element).data()
[10:16:28] <duch_kazatel> you're thinking of $.data()
[10:16:44] <duch_kazatel> the former takes one if you want to read that value, or two if you want to set that one.
[10:17:18] <ADuquet> oh, thanks! hey, my very first q&a. I'm on my way... ;-) (i hope)
[10:18:18] <duch_kazatel> $(element).data('myThing') reads the data-myThing attribute or the cached jquery data property 'myThing' on element.  $(element).data('myThing' 'a value') will set the cached data property.
[10:18:19] <minato> can we use jquery plugins in jquery mobile ?
[10:18:41] <minato> and then convert jquery mobile to app using phonegap without having any issues?
[10:19:49] <duch_kazatel> minato probably depends on the plugin.
[10:35:05] <silverdust> If I do a .attr("title") = "Foobar" does it append the former title if the element already had a title or it replaces it?
[10:35:13] <duch_kazatel> replaces it.
[10:35:47] <silverdust> ok cool
[10:44:21] <Cork> silverdust: you can't do attr() = <value>
[10:44:30] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah good catch.
[10:44:49] <duch_kazatel> .attr("title", "Foobar")
[10:44:50] <Cork> its attr('key', <value>)
[10:45:18] <Cork> and most of the time you want prop not attr
[10:45:31] <duch_kazatel> generally.
[10:48:03] <chinoto> Or if you're setting many properties/attributes, you can just pass an object to them. {checked:true,disabled:false} (what would you set the attributes for after element creation?)
[10:49:10] <Cork> chinoto: for after element creation??
[10:49:11] <jenia> hello. i need to change the listview in jquery mobile
[10:49:16] <jenia> like so:
[10:49:18] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/21/
[10:49:23] <zorak8> Hi, i want to implement Datepicker to a rails app but i dont know how
[10:49:37] <zorak8> now any guide or tutorial for this?
[10:49:37] <jenia> however, when the new item is added, its not rendered exactly as all the other items
[10:49:54] <jenia> does anyone know how to solve this?
[10:50:04] <Cork> zorak8: just add a normal input field and run the js function from an asset
[10:50:28] <zorak8> I download a couple of files from the webpage
[10:50:43] <zorak8> jus put those files into my rails app and then call it?
[10:50:46] <duch_kazatel> zorak8 the frontend doesn't care about the backend - it being rails doesn't matter.
[10:50:48] <duch_kazatel> :)
[10:50:51] <duch_kazatel> if you
[10:51:13] <duch_kazatel> *if you're trying to figure out how to include plugins and libs, there's an asset pipeline rails uses iirc.
[10:51:29] <zorak8> im very noob in rails and in programming in general, this is my first no-tutorial app
[10:51:50] <zorak8> and im tring to implement a datepicker and i lie the jquery one
[10:51:55] <zorak8> like*
[10:52:01] <duch_kazatel> zorak8 if you need info on how to include libs and stuff, i'd ask in a channel about rails.
[10:52:14] <zorak8> yes, im asking there too
[10:52:19] <Cork> ya #rubyonrails is prob what you need
[10:52:48] <chinoto> Cork: Once an element is created, what use is there for modifying it's attributes? I just thought of one: selectors.
[10:53:51] <Cork> chinoto: there is basically no need to set value with attr instead of prop
[10:53:52] <chinoto> Seeing as modifying attributes generally isn't supposed to effect the element after creation.
[10:54:04] <Cork> chinoto: the only real use of attr is for reading values
[10:54:08] <chinoto> affect*
[10:54:14] <duch_kazatel> *reading original values.
[10:54:17] <Cork> ya
[10:54:54] <duch_kazatel> i had to grill coworkers about that distinction recently.
[10:55:06] <duch_kazatel> same with using .data() instead of .attr('data-*').  kills me.
[10:55:28] <Cork> duch_kazatel: what direction? :D
[10:55:32] <chinoto> I actually use attr for that :3
[10:55:37] <duch_kazatel> chinoto :(
[10:55:52] <chinoto> Not sure why, I did have a reason though.
[10:56:03] <Cork> well if you need to use selectors you want attr('data-')
[10:56:08] <duch_kazatel> Cork they were using .attr('data-*') in a lot of places, and .attr() in cases where they should use .prop() - it bit one of them recently.
[10:56:11] <Cork> but well you shouldn't select on those anyway
[10:56:16] <duch_kazatel> work.
[10:56:17] <duch_kazatel> *word
[10:56:48] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ya, i'm reviewing checkins so i kinda veto those ^^
[10:57:11] <duch_kazatel> cork i do the same.
[10:57:29] <duch_kazatel> we have one guy in particular that fancies himself as being this huge mega-genius.
[10:57:38] <duch_kazatel> i catch him on those things pretty regularly.
[10:58:16] <Cork> what irks me the most (and i see it a lot in this channel)
[10:58:17] <chinoto> I used to review the commits, but after awhile, it's just not worthwhile, I pretty much always have something to work on.
[10:58:37] <Cork> is when ppl do $('[id^="somehting"]')
[10:58:43] <duch_kazatel> chinoto we have mandatory code review for PCI compliance, so we can't NOT review them.
[10:58:43] <chinoto> oh dear
[10:58:48] <duch_kazatel> cork O.O
[10:58:53] <duch_kazatel> that's terrible.
[10:59:02] <Cork> duch_kazatel: it is really common
[10:59:14] <Cork> ppl really need to learn to use classes
[10:59:17] <duch_kazatel> word.
[10:59:18] <chinoto> That should be a class, then you have a data- attribute.
[10:59:21] <duch_kazatel> classes are not a bad thing.
[10:59:47] <duch_kazatel> classes and objects.
[11:01:26] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: I wish we were a bit more tight on the security, but there's always something to work on, so we never do any official reviews. It's mostly me finding some common quirk and going around fixing it.
[11:01:35] <ul71m0> im trying to add class to element with jquery, but it doesnt work, not sure why http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/142/
[11:01:55] <chinoto> Like forgetting to escape something.
[11:01:59] <duch_kazatel> chinoto start processing credit cards and that changes :)
[11:02:15] <jaspertheghost> hello it seems that using a manifest file that even ajax requests try to use the cached versions of files is this true?
[11:02:48] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost ajax is like any other request - the browser will cache them.
[11:02:54] <duch_kazatel> well, the GETs at least.
[11:03:00] <Cork> ul71m0: you're not adding classes, you're adding a child element
[11:03:01] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: We have some other company doing that (coworker was against it, but management...).
[11:03:26] <duch_kazatel> chinoto we also do code review because it makes things like upgrading jquery easier.
[11:03:51] <zorak8> ok, thanks for your help, find another in bootstrap build it for rails that is easier to implement
[11:03:53] <zorak8> cya!
[11:04:22] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Hm, we haven't had problems so far, we just upgrade it willy nilly whenever we think it's causing a problem.
[11:04:42] <duch_kazatel> chinoto our application is much larger and has more legacy stuff in it than others
[11:05:12] <chinoto> Ours has only been around for a couple years, so that makes sense.
[11:05:28] <duch_kazatel> we had to remove out all the deprecated methods and whatnot.  hell, we're killing mootools in one area.
[11:05:34] <jaspertheghost> how can i stop the browser from caching my .getJSON(".....php?blah " stuff?
[11:05:37] <duch_kazatel> and some of this code is around 10 years old.
[11:05:41] <Velveeta> mootools?
[11:05:46] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:05:47] <Velveeta> jebus
[11:05:55] <chinoto> jaspertheghost: $.ajax()
[11:05:56] <duch_kazatel> jaspertheghost check out using http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ instead.
[11:06:03] <Cork> jaspertheghost: use $.ajax and set cache: false
[11:06:32] <chinoto> jaspertheghost: All the options in https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/ apply to $.ajax()
[11:06:35] <duch_kazatel> there's also http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajaxsetup/, but I would avoid using it if possible.
[11:06:50] <Cork> heh
[11:07:00] <jaspertheghost> thank you
[11:07:02] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: All of them apply, so you can do one time options.
[11:07:13] <Velveeta> you can also just append some random string as a parameter to the end of your url.. that's all the cache flag does anyway
[11:07:27] <duch_kazatel> chinoto sure, and then later on you want caching and can't figure out why it doesn't work ;)
[11:07:29] <Velveeta> like '?r=' + Math.random()
[11:07:32] <ul71m0> Cork: : im sorry, i see now that  i wrote " tryint to add class " what im trying to do is to add css :)
[11:07:45] <Cork> css??
[11:07:46] <ul71m0> Cork: in line #21 of javascript i tried to add background
[11:07:51] <Cork> ah
[11:07:51] <ul71m0> to element
[11:08:14] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: You're not understanding. $.ajax(url,{cache:false});
[11:08:14] <Cork> ul71m0: you add the style before the element exist
[11:08:16] <duch_kazatel> chinoto i have a page that has 3 or 4 different ajax calls on it - we disable caching on one of them specifically.  people asked why we don't just change all of them.
[11:08:44] <Cork> ul71m0: you need to add the css when you add it (so technically you can add it inline in the string you already have)
[11:09:01] <duch_kazatel> chinoto i thought you were saying to use $.ajaxSetup() instead - I usually suggest people don't do that.
[11:09:24] <ul71m0> Cork:  im lost... :/
[11:09:57] <Cork> ul71m0: the function on line 21 searches for all element with the slider-tip class
[11:10:23] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: Oh that's odd, I always thought the options for $.ajax()'s settings were listed in $.ajaxSetup()...
[11:10:25] <ul71m0> but i dont have that element?
[11:10:31] <Cork> and adds style="background-color: yellow;" to those elements
[11:10:43] <Cork> ul71m0: in your case the selector results in no matches
[11:10:45] <ul71m0> Cork: i figured that
[11:10:48] <Cork> so nothing gets added
[11:11:00] <duch_kazatel> chinoto it's the other way around :) $.ajaxSetup() points you to $.ajax() for a list of settings.
[11:11:06] <ul71m0> Cork: but why i dont have element?
[11:11:10] <chinoto> duch_kazatel: If I knew they weren't, I wouldn't have brought it up.
[11:11:14] <Cork> ul71m0: so you either need to move it into the mousemove event
[11:11:23] <Cork> ul71m0: cause you add it in the mouse events
[11:11:35] <ul71m0> let me try that Cork
[11:12:00] <duch_kazatel> i totally wish you could upgrade your shipping option after an item has shipped.
[11:12:43] <Cork> duch_kazatel: btw i got his link in an implementation bug about es6 http://jsfiddle.net/4T6yz/
[11:12:56] <Cork> funny enough "b" is apparently meant to return 10 not 20 :)
[11:13:09] <duch_kazatel> fat arrows :(
[11:13:14] <duch_kazatel> get that ruby outta my js
[11:13:14] <Cork> and default values
[11:13:26] <jenia> hello again everyone
[11:13:35] <jenia> i have a listview that i need to populate at runtime
[11:13:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: ruby doesn't have fat arrows
[11:13:49] <jenia> when i do that, the elements inside it are not rendered correctly:
[11:14:02] <duch_kazatel> Cork yes it dow.
[11:14:09] <Cork> duch_kazatel: not for functions
[11:14:09] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/21/
[11:14:15] <duch_kazatel> oh derp you're right.
[11:14:18] <Cork> duch_kazatel: => is used for hashes in ruby
[11:14:22] <jenia> maybe someone knows how to do it
[11:14:22] <duch_kazatel> i am not a fan of ruby tbh.
[11:14:36] <Cork> i have mixed feelings, but i'm ok with it
[11:15:04] <duch_kazatel> jenia why such an old version of jquery?
[11:15:46] <jenia> i couldnt make any other version work. i found this example from someone and forked it
[11:15:48] <duch_kazatel> also: you have to trigger the 'create' event or something on the page.
[11:15:53] <jenia> some other example acutally
[11:16:02] <jenia> i'm glad to use the latest version
[11:16:12] <duch_kazatel> 1.6 is way old.
[11:16:41] <Velveeta> jenia: you need to tell jqm to restyle its stuff w/ a create trigger, apparently: http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/22/
[11:17:12] <jenia> nice
[11:17:25] <jenia> nice. thanks so much
[11:17:38] <duch_kazatel> jqm adds classes and other stuff.
[11:17:55] <Velveeta> also, if you do this: http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/24/
[11:18:02] <Velveeta> it'll insert it into the proper (expected) place
[11:18:02] <duch_kazatel> which is why you have to trigger the create event manually. surprised there isn't an api to do that magically for you.
[11:18:10] <jenia> hehe
[11:18:29] <Velveeta> duch: yeah, you'd think someone would have implemented dirty-checking or something for it, though i suppose that could eat up a phone battery
[11:18:46] <ul71m0> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/144/ so im trying to add margin-left to that element in line 17 and i have variable margin created in line 8 just not sure how to pass it
[11:18:48] <jenia> thanks very very much duch_kazatel and Velveeta
[11:18:55] <Velveeta> no problemo
[11:19:01] <Velveeta> i've done my good dead for this quarter
[11:19:16] <jenia> hehe
[11:19:47] <Cork> ul71m0: you add the element on line 19
[11:20:00] <Cork> so ya adding it on line 17 won't work
[11:21:56] <Cork> ul71m0: http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/146/
[11:23:26] <ul71m0> Cork: thanks man, i see now that i have bug in my formula for variable, i jsut want the damn tooltip to be on middle of selected area
[11:24:55] <inv3nt0r> Hey everyone... Trying to solve a little puzzle here. Basically my goal is to make a number of select dropdowns change if any of them are changed. I have created the following code: http://jsfiddle.net/ejnYq/
[11:25:46] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r console.log(this).val()
[11:25:49] <duch_kazatel> see the issue?
[11:25:49] <inv3nt0r> I can't seem to read the value of the select dropdown...
[11:25:54] <inv3nt0r> Yes I see that
[11:26:11] <duch_kazatel> also what are you setting value to?
[11:26:32] <inv3nt0r> The value should just be mirrored on all select elements
[11:26:42] <inv3nt0r> ie. if I change the value on one, it will change on the others
[11:26:49] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[11:26:50] <KevinCollmer> hi guys.
[11:27:10] <duch_kazatel> first off don't put your event binding inside the .each()
[11:27:13] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel :) That's what I was hoping for, until I ran into the .val problem
[11:27:25] <ul71m0> Cork: i see that i treat this as pixels and that wont work :) I need to somehow find middle of selected are and place tooltip there
[11:27:26] <duch_kazatel> second: use event delevation.
[11:27:36] <KevinCollmer> Im currently getting some problems with window.load combined with mouseovers on these loaded elements. If someone could just look over my code it would be pretty awesome
[11:27:57] <KevinCollmer> it was all working before but since im using load() it isnt working anymore
[11:28:08] <Cork> ul71m0: percent maybe?
[11:28:43] <ul71m0> Cork: but percent of what ? :) maybe .position will work let me check that
[11:29:27] <Cork> ul71m0: the handles are positioned by percent
[11:29:27] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r third, your $(this) isn't carrying through the way you assume it does.
[11:29:30] <MagePsycho> Hi Guys
[11:29:59] <Cork> ul71m0: so left handle + (right handle - left handle) / 2
[11:30:07] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:30:19] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Sounds good... I'll keep poking away at this
[11:30:31] <duch_kazatel> btw http://jsfiddle.net/ejnYq/2/
[11:30:32] <ul71m0> aha let me try that as my variable formula
[11:31:02] <jaspertheghost> when outputing javascript code via php do i need to send a javascript file type header?
[11:31:08] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Getting closer, I'm managing to read the value now properly
[11:32:14] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/ejnYq/5/
[11:32:23] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: It appears to work now
[11:33:01] <ul71m0> Cork: hmm that wont work :) or im doing something wrong http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/147/
[11:36:17] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r did you look at the link I shared?
[11:36:37] <inv3nt0r> Sorry I didn't see that... let me scroll back up
[11:36:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ejnYq/2/
[11:37:06] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: Thank you
[11:37:23] <inv3nt0r> duch_kazatel: That is definitely a more elegant method. Mine seems to fire the event 9 times :)
[11:37:40] <duch_kazatel> inv3nt0r right because you're binding a bunch of times.
[11:37:42] <duch_kazatel> bind once.
[11:37:43] <duch_kazatel> done.
[11:45:56] <Cork> ul71m0: how about http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/148/ ?
[11:46:43] <ul71m0> Cork: that is it!!!! :)
[11:46:58] <Cork> ul71m0: note you don't need the margin values at all :)
[11:47:00] <ul71m0> Cork: thanks man, will need to learn more on this logic
[11:47:23] <Cork> also note that backwards compatible for calc is a bit... short
[11:47:30] <Cork> ?g mdn css clac
[11:47:31] <b-ot> Cork: calc - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc
[11:47:36] <Cork> lol
[11:48:25] <Cork> ul71m0: it is basically just css magic :9
[11:48:30] <antlong> how can i make it so that hitting enter doesn't refresh the page, or such? https://dpaste.de/axTH
[11:48:43] <chinoto> jaspertheghost: Even if it isn't, it's a good idea.
[11:48:56] <duch_kazatel> antlong pass the event object and preventDefault() on it.
[11:49:06] <chinoto> jaspertheghost: header('Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8')
[11:49:13] <Cork> duch_kazatel: he does return false at the end
[11:49:26] <Cork> but he most likely doesn't attach a submit event on the form
[11:49:33] <antlong> there shouldn't be a submit even
[11:49:34] <duch_kazatel> returning false is a bad idea.
[11:49:37] <antlong> its just a text filter
[11:49:38] <Cork> it is
[11:49:51] <ul71m0> Cork: you are magician i fixed it so it always have normal width
[11:49:55] <ul71m0> http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/149/
[11:49:58] <duch_kazatel> antlong you want .on('submit', function(e){e.preventDefault()});
[11:50:03] <chinoto> jaspertheghost: I do that on everything. In some cases, you might see failures if it isn't the right content-type, I think I had that with $.post() and json.
[11:50:27] <antlong> duch_kazatel thank you sir
[11:50:41] <Cork> ul71m0: you could make the css static then
[11:51:28] <MagePsycho> hi guys
[11:51:42] <MagePsycho> can anyone take a look at this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/nH5QF/6/
[11:51:48] <MagePsycho> might be some simple thing missing
[11:52:04] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do?
[11:52:36] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[11:52:38] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:52:44] <duch_kazatel> MagePsycho ^^ read that page.
[11:52:51] <decx> wrong attribute selector, pointless text
[11:53:12] <duch_kazatel> don't event need an attribute selector in there.
[11:53:14] <Cork> ul71m0: http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/150/
[11:53:19] <ul71m0> Cork: now just to see why is this error popin
[11:54:03] <Cork> ul71m0: you're using ui.values in the mouseenter event
[11:54:27] <ul71m0> Cork: so this all could have been don jsut with css, omg :)
[11:54:40] <Cork> ul71m0: very modern css yes
[11:55:07] <Cork> ul71m0: calc() doesn't work pre ie9
[11:55:12] <ul71m0> Cork: i guess its supported by all modern browser latest version + one before ;)
[11:55:17] <ul71m0> ie9 is fine
[11:55:34] <antlong> duch_kazatel sorry, but does that work like, x.on('input', func, 'submit
[11:55:39] <antlong> duch_kazatel sorry, but does that work like, x.on('input', func, 'submit', func)?
[11:56:11] <ul71m0> Cork: what is the best way to get rid of this error?
[11:56:49] <Cork> ul71m0: i would make the div you put inside it static meaning add it once when the slider is created
[11:57:04] <Cork> and set the content with .text() instead
[11:57:09] <Cork> and instead of html('')
[11:57:13] <Cork> use .hide()
[11:57:23] <Cork> and then you can do .show() in mouseenter
[11:58:47] <niko> hi
[12:00:29] <ul71m0> Cork: if you can fiddle it one more last time that would be very helpfoul this is my first serious touch of .js and im still lost ;)
[12:10:02] <Cork> ul71m0: how about http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/152/ ?
[12:10:35] <duch_kazatel> antlong you mean delegation?
[12:10:42] <duch_kazatel> antlong it's $(parent).on(
[12:11:05] <antlong> duch_kazatel do i get rid of the 'input' portion I have?
[12:11:09] <duch_kazatel> err $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});, where parent exists at the time of binding.
[12:11:24] <duch_kazatel> what was that binding for, antlong?
[12:11:33] <antlong> duch_kazatel to make nothing happen when you hit enter
[12:11:38] <ul71m0> Cork: it disappear if you are out of handle and holding click
[12:11:57] <ul71m0> Cork:  and im sure it will be reported as bug :/
[12:12:00] <duch_kazatel> $('form').on('submit', function(e){e.preventDefault();});
[12:12:02] <duch_kazatel> try that instead.
[12:12:07] <Cork> ul71m0: hmm
[12:12:12] <duch_kazatel> where "form" is the input you're trying to kill.
[12:12:48] <duch_kazatel> err, the form you're trying to kill.
[12:13:10] <Cork> ul71m0: when exactly do you want to show the tooltip?
[12:13:16] <ul71m0> Cork: is it easy fix to have it on always while you holding click, no matter where is is mouse
[12:13:32] <chinoto> MagePsycho: This is at least closer to what you want I think: http://jsfiddle.net/nH5QF/7/
[12:13:55] <ul71m0> Cork: in last fiddle if you drag it and accedently move your mouse below or above the handle it will dissapear
[12:14:07] <Cork> ul71m0: as in 1. hovering the slider (anywhere), 2. hovering the handles, 3. hovering the handles or the range area
[12:15:36] <chinoto> MagePsycho: I think the only change needed is adding 995 to it.
[12:17:27] <ul71m0> Cork: it should be on all the time when mouse pressed handle no matter where to cursor is. if you know what i mean...
[12:18:00] <duch_kazatel> ul71m0 that's a really strange request.
[12:18:19] <ul71m0> like on this example #2 http://seiyria.github.io/bootstrap-slider/
[12:18:22] <Cork> ul71m0: i didn't ask about press i asked about hover
[12:18:48] <chinoto> It sucks when people don't answer...
[12:18:53] <Cork> duch_kazatel: not really
[12:19:11] <Cork> duch_kazatel: he wants the mouse event to be trapped on the handle
[12:19:28] <duch_kazatel> i guess i just don't see that being an issue personally.
[12:19:37] <duch_kazatel> but meh.
[12:20:20] <drej> any of you guys css wizards?
[12:20:30] <ul71m0> or tell me guys am i going crazy here...
[12:20:31] <chinoto> drej: Ask the question.
[12:20:36] <Cork> drej: joinds like you want #css
[12:20:40] <Cork> *sounds
[12:20:51] <drej> #css doesnt help me
[12:20:58] <chinoto> drej: Ask the question.
[12:20:59] <duch_kazatel> drej i know enough to be dangerous sometimes.
[12:21:02] <drej> i have a super niche problem so im branching out :)
[12:21:03] <drej> http://jsfiddle.net/6Exkj/6/
[12:21:15] <drej> looks like translateX is confining a fixed position element thats a child
[12:21:22] <drej> so if you toggle translateX on the section element
[12:21:31] <drej> the .modal window gets clipped / goes full screen depending on whether is toggled or not
[12:21:35] <il> in Datatables 1.10.0, oTable.fnFilter("") is returning "undefined is not a function." Why is that? Is fnFilter outdated?
[12:22:26] <duch_kazatel> il according to http://www.datatables.net/upgrade/1.10, it should still be there.
[12:23:54] <duch_kazatel> il those kinds of errors mean either the plugin isn't loaded, or the object isn't initialized the way you think it is.
[12:24:15] <Cork> ul71m0: anyway http://jsfiddle.net/BKQ4X/153/
[12:24:39] <Cork> ul71m0: if you want to do something different for the hover you will have to do it your self as you didn't answer the question
[12:25:59] <drej> so does anyone want to venture a guess
[12:26:10] <gordian> 12?
[12:26:20] <duch_kazatel> 13
[12:26:51] <gordian> drej: what's the question?
[12:26:53] <drej> 13 it is!
[12:27:00] <drej> gordian it was a css question
[12:27:03] <BillCriswell> 97
[12:27:06] <drej> translateX seems to be clipping a fixed position element
[12:27:13] <gordian> oh, isn't this #jquery?
[12:27:22] <gordian> ;-)
[12:27:40] <drej> that's the problem with #css
[12:27:44] <drej> im the smartest person in there
[12:27:52] <gordian> oic
[12:28:08] <gordian> and smarter than everyone on stackoverflow?
[12:28:27] <gordian> …combined?!?
[12:28:39] <drej> probably
[12:28:43] <Cork> css has some smart ppl, the culture in there is very harsh and bad though
[12:28:56] <drej> Cork we've been changing that, its been better over the last year
[12:29:09] <drej> here's a basic example: http://jsfiddle.net/aQ8mC/
[12:29:16] <drej> toggle the translateX(0); on section
[12:29:37] <jphaser> bah, I just blinked for the first time in like 20 minutes and now I'm crying at work...
[12:29:39] <gordian> considering that most non-regulars join and ask questions like "how can i fix my problem?" i think it's appropriately harsh
[12:29:52] <BillCriswell> I wish there was an interval for CSS animations.
[12:30:05] <Cork> drej: ... at least set the default css name and not just -webkit....
[12:30:34] <ul71m0> Cork:  that is it! :) thanks man you helped me a lot!
[12:30:36] <ul71m0> Cork++
[12:30:46] <drej> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/aQ8mC/1/
[12:31:45] <drej> or uhm how do i "undo" translateX
[12:31:48] <drej> lol
[12:31:48] <Cork> drej: heh i litteraly meant -webkit and unprefixed, all other browsers has unprefixed those values
[12:32:11] <drej> Cork ive made like 230598 testcases before i even found out it was translateX
[12:32:15] <drej> sorry
[12:32:38] <Cork> drej: na, i just hate when ppl go webkit only
[12:33:33] <chinoto> I've been complaining about vendor extensions for awhile myself...
[12:34:16] <Cork> drej: and to answer the question transform: none;?
[12:34:38] <Cork> chinoto: vendor prefixes isn't used anymore
[12:34:48] <Cork> basically only webkit use them
[12:34:58] <chinoto> What about gradients?
[12:35:03] <Cork> except for a few css values still on the standardisation track
[12:35:16] <Cork> those has been unprefixed for a long time
[12:35:33] <circ-user-B4PJg> I want to load the fields in a form in ajax, except that I can not retrieve values in POST
[12:35:41] <silverdust> Cork: what?
[12:35:44] <Cork> even chrome has it unprexied for ~ a year
[12:35:55] <silverdust> vendor prefixes don't exist anymore?
[12:35:59] <Cork> yes
[12:36:02] <chinoto> I guess I haven't been paying too much attention...
[12:36:11] <silverdust> Am I behind the world or you are way ahead the world
[12:36:13] <Cork> silverdust: they use browser preferences instead
[12:36:38] <Cork> silverdust: ok let me clarify a little bit
[12:36:43] <silverdust> There are a lotta properties I know that still require vendor prefixes from caniuse.com
[12:36:47] <Cork> there are still some prefixes out there
[12:36:52] <Cork> but no new ones are added
[12:37:04] <silverdust> ok
[12:37:04] <chinoto> The way I always thought would be nice is if all the browsers would accept vendorless properties, but then you could override any property using a vendor prefix.
[12:37:05] <Cork> and the old one is slowly getting standardized
[12:37:14] <Cork> and removed from every engine except webkit
[12:37:48] <Cork> chinoto: the new solution is you can't use pre standard features at all
[12:37:59] <chinoto> Cork: Well that sucks.
[12:38:01] <Cork> you have to flip a switch in the browser
[12:38:06] <Cork> in firefox it is in about:config
[12:38:11] <Cork> in chrome it is a command line option
[12:38:22] <Cork> chinoto: well blame apple
[12:38:23] <chinoto> Oh, I guess that helps.
[12:39:03] <Cork> chinoto: apple stated the won't ever face out old prefixes
[12:39:13] <chinoto> phase?
[12:39:18] <Cork> and they even pushed developers to use prexies for everything
[12:39:21] <Cork> ya sorry
[12:39:44] <Cork> so they basically made all mobile sites webkit only cause of -webkit-
[12:39:56] <Cork> so they moved to the pref solution instead
[12:40:03] <chinoto> But aside from some really old things, css isn't dangerous, so I think my solution would be the better way to go.
[12:40:17] <Cork> chinoto: no it wouldn't
[12:40:34] <Cork> chinoto: if you let browser use prefix less properties before standardisation
[12:40:38] <chinoto> Then when stuff is standardized, you would just get rid of the overrides for people that were doing stuff differently.
[12:40:40] <Cork> you get default standards
[12:40:45] <Cork> not developed standards
[12:40:58] <chinoto> Cork: Ok, you got a point there.
[12:41:03] <Cork> and we would have had background-image: grandients(linear...); hell from webkit
[12:41:42] <Cork> or a lot of the other pre standard messes that has existed over the years
[12:42:19] <duch_kazatel> one of the biggest lie any dev tells themself: "i'll just remove these prefixes when they become standard"
[12:42:24] <duch_kazatel> *lies
[12:42:24] <Cork> opps default == defacto
[12:42:48] <Cork> duch_kazatel: i actually do
[12:42:55] <Cork> i add them in separate css files
[12:42:56] <duch_kazatel> impressive.
[12:43:03] <chinoto> I guess linear-gradient could have turned out slightly better.
[12:43:05] <Cork> stamped with the version of the browser that needs it
[12:43:21] <Cork> chinoto: linear-gradient was the standard result
[12:43:58] <Cork> webkit had -webkit-gradient(linerar, option, option, option)
[12:44:21] <chinoto> We had several different variations, it doesn't seem like they really developed that, more like settled on what most browsers happened to be doing.
[12:44:22] <ciqsteve> jqueryUI question--
[12:44:36] <Cork> chinoto: no thy didn't
[12:44:47] <ciqsteve> I have multiple lists... say 20.. so I need to apply .sortable() to each.  I get the ids with
[12:44:52] <Cork> chinoto: it was a LOT of back and forth before they landed linear-gradient
[12:44:54] <ciqsteve> var ids = $('[id*="sortable-"]');
[12:45:03] <chinoto> ciqsteve: terrible
[12:45:08] <duch_kazatel> ew.
[12:45:16] <duch_kazatel> apply a class to them instead and select on that.,
[12:45:17] <Cork> duch_kazatel: see what i mean?
[12:45:20] <chinoto> ciqsteve: Use a class and a data-
[12:45:24] <duch_kazatel> you weren't wrong
[12:45:43] <duch_kazatel> i don't think i've ever seen that at any place i've worked.
[12:45:43] <ciqsteve> but doesn't jqueryUI .sortable() behind the scenes require an ID?
[12:45:46] <duch_kazatel> must be blessed.
[12:46:00] <duch_kazatel> ciqsteve don't get the IDs that way.
[12:46:03] <chinoto> ciqsteve: for the items, not the sortable.
[12:46:07] <duch_kazatel> the issue is your selector.
[12:46:41] <ciqsteve> duch.. how is a better way to do the selector?
[12:46:41] <chinoto> ciqsteve: Oh, sortable doesn't care at all about the container having an id at all.
[12:46:56] <trent1> is there away i can make a jquery deferred immediately resolve?
[12:47:01] <Cork> ciqsteve: [id*="sortable-"] is an attribute selector
[12:47:15] <chinoto> ciqsteve: If you have multiple sortables, just give them all a class, then do $('.class').sortable()
[12:47:25] <Cork> ciqsteve: it will select all elements in the page, loop then and check for an attribute with the name id
[12:47:34] <Cork> and then check if the value include sortable-
[12:47:35] <duch_kazatel> which is painfully slow.
[12:47:39] <BillCriswell> This feels overcomplicated... what am I overcomplicating? http://jsbin.com/duyora/3/edit
[12:47:53] <Cork> ciqsteve: it means you work around basically every optimization there is in the browser
[12:48:11] <Cork> ciqsteve: instead add a class like class="selectable"
[12:48:16] <ciqsteve> :) I try to make things easy on myself
[12:48:18] <Cork> to each one of them
[12:48:22] <ciqsteve> [[thanks much for the help]]
[12:48:24] <Cork> and then do $('.selectable')
[12:48:46] <ciqsteve> what I have is 20 sortable lists.. each with 5 elements.. each list is a container..   I need to be able to move an
[12:48:51] <MagePsycho> chinoto: You missed to add the default price
[12:48:54] <ciqsteve> element from any one container to any other container
[12:48:54] <chinoto> BillCriswell: Worrying too much I think.
[12:49:05] <chinoto> chinoto: As I said, probably need to add 995
[12:49:09] <Cork> ciqsteve: you can connect the different elements
[12:49:13] <chinoto> MagePsycho: ^
[12:49:30] <ciqsteve> can I do  $(".sortable").sortable({connectWith: ".connectedSortable"})
[12:49:30] <BillCriswell> chinoto: Yeah probably.
[12:49:48] <ciqsteve> it ends up being the cartesian product
[12:50:06] <Cork> ciqsteve: if i remember correctly; yes
[12:50:14] <Cork> though i haven't used sortable for a while
[12:50:20] <ciqsteve> cork--  interesting will try that now
[12:50:21] <chinoto> ciqsteve: If there are groups of sortables, use a class for each group.
[12:50:34] <ciqsteve> there are 20 sortable 'groups'
[12:50:35] <chinoto> ciqsteve: for connectWith.
[12:50:55] <ciqsteve> items in group need to move from any groupX to groupY
[12:51:11] <chinoto> I'm confused.
[12:51:37] <shoky> $(".sortable").sortable({connectWith: ".sortable"})
[12:52:06] <ciqsteve> real world-  Im working with scanned paper applications that are 5 pages.   sometimes (frequently) the person doing the scanning screws up the page order
[12:52:20] <ciqsteve> so I'm making an app to fix it..     need to be able to move pages within an app
[12:52:28] <chinoto> ciqsteve: I thought you meant sets of sortables that can share with each other but not outside their set.
[12:52:30] <ciqsteve> application   and move pages between applications
[12:52:34] <jaspertheghost> damnit jquery mobile works on my phone  and android 2.2 but this stupid 2.3 device fucks it all up
[12:53:06] <ciqsteve> application1[ P1, P2, P3]  application2[ P1, P2, P3]
[12:53:21] <ciqsteve> I need to move the Ps around.. and there are 20 applications
[12:53:35] <shoky> ciqsteve:  $(".sortable").sortable({connectWith: ".sortable"})
[12:53:36] <chinoto> ciqsteve: So application1 is a sortable and P1 is an item of the sortable?
[12:53:44] <ciqsteve> chinoto = y es
[12:54:05] <chinoto> And items can be moved to any sortable?
[12:54:17] <ciqsteve> yes
[12:54:35] <chinoto> ciqsteve: then listen to what we've been saying (latest: shoky).
[12:55:07] <ciqsteve> y trying that... was just clearing up b/c thought my case wasnt clear.. thx much.. (back in a sec)
[12:56:34] <ciqsteve> kickass
[12:56:50] <ciqsteve> thanks for help..
[12:57:02] <ciqsteve> chinoto - shoky - thanks!
[13:03:09] <ciqsteve> ok here's an odd problem
[13:03:34] <ciqsteve> I'm working off the jqueryUI examples... they include simple inline styling:
[13:03:44] <ciqsteve>   #sortable { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 575px; }
[13:03:44] <ciqsteve>   #sortable li { margin: 3px 3px 3px 0; padding: 1px; float: left; width: 170px; height: 250px; font-size: 4em; text-align: center; }
[13:04:03] <ciqsteve> I changed everything to a class, so the stlying isnt applied.. works fine
[13:04:18] <ciqsteve> if I change the stlying to .sortable..    it doesnt work anymore..
[13:04:19] <ciqsteve> ??
[13:04:37] <jenia> hello again.
[13:04:48] <jenia> can i have a "select multiple" in  a listview?
[13:04:54] <jenia> like this:http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/25/
[13:04:59] <jenia> it never finished loading though
[13:05:13] <jenia> if you remove the "multiple" it will run fine.
[13:06:28] <chinoto> ciqsteve: Is this public?
[13:06:56] <chinoto> ciqsteve: If not, make an example in jsfiddle or jsbin.
[13:07:08] <ciqsteve> will do
[13:08:47] <chinoto> jenia: Something is fundamentally broken, look at console.
[13:09:14] <Daghdha> Anyone here know how i can prevent allowing multiple files with blueimp for drag/drop of files. I removed the multiple and it's using  <input id="fileupload" type="file" name="file"> wich is fine for the file select dialog. But when i drag 2 files on it it sill uploads both
[13:11:17] <jenia> chinoto. yea. i dont know what it is.
[13:11:32] <jenia> but in any case, I dont think jquery mobile support "multiple" selection
[13:12:03] <chinoto> jenia: It almost works when I upgrade the jquery version: http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/26/
[13:12:32] <Daghdha> jenia: It's windows :)
[13:12:39] <chinoto> Woops, commented out a line to test before changing jquery version.
[13:13:04] <jenia> chinoto, Daghdha like this:
[13:13:05] <jenia> http://jsfiddle.net/73pSv/27/
[13:13:23] <jenia> but as you can see, it doesnt show the multiple elements
[13:13:27] <Daghdha> oh i thought you replied to my multiple question
[13:13:42] <chinoto> Where'd the code go?
[13:14:35] <chinoto> Ugh, I need to get some work done >.<
[13:14:53] <onethfour> has anyone tried jHtmlArea ?
[13:15:15] <onethfour> I need to get an onblur into it but I don't know how to do that
[13:15:19] <ciqsteve> ok..
[13:15:19] <ciqsteve> http://jsfiddle.net/S5DLL/1/
[13:15:29] <ciqsteve> works w css #
[13:15:31] <ciqsteve> not with .
[13:15:39] <Daghdha> Put it in a span
[13:15:46] <drej> Cork http://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#issues-index
[13:15:48] <drej> in case you were curious
[13:15:51] <drej> its issue #1 there
[13:17:08] <Cork> drej: ah, ya i should have caught that one
[13:19:44] <Cork> weeee
[13:23:02] <sudormf> Anyone here know how to prevent Jquery Mobile from processing the url token?
[13:27:00] <ciqsteve> chance to check the fiddle?
[13:27:17] <sudormf> Anyone here know how to prevent Jquery Mobile from processing the url token?
[13:29:44] <ciqsteve> figured it out
[13:29:51] <ciqsteve> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/4551
[13:30:09] <ciqsteve> obscure - 5 years ago.. need to float the containers also not just the items
[13:43:19] <styol> Hey there. I can't recall what the DOM context switching argument that can be provided is. Anyone know? IE: $('#selector', DOM)
[13:43:31] <styol> er, can't recall what the name of it is
[13:43:49] <duch_kazatel> styol that's like using .find()
[13:43:53] <jaspertheghost> anyone wanna venture a guess as to why jquery would work on an android 2.3 deivce one minute and not the next?
[13:44:21] <Cork> styol: the term is context
[13:44:25] <__joshua___> styol: its called context
[13:44:26] <__joshua___> heh
[13:44:38] <styol> ah, well that makes sense ;)
[13:45:09] <Cork> jaspertheghost: cause the android browser is a peas of shit?
[13:45:52] <Cork> the only browser on the planet that is worse is ios browser
[13:46:15] <jaspertheghost> well this is a serious proble now i didnt change a thing and it wasnt working just a minute ago
[13:46:27] <styol> is there any way to proxy an element / selector to a different context? I've basically got a scenario where the original code calls $('#selector') and I need it to call $('#selector', DOM). Right now the only solution I've been able to come up with is AST parsing and replacing all references, which is proving pretty fun with esprima
[13:47:01] <Cork> styol: no there isn't
[13:47:10] <Cork> styol: have the caller send a string to you instead
[13:47:19] <sudormf> anyone here know how to prevent jquery mobile from trying to process url hashes?
[13:47:43] <Cork> styol: the problem is cause $() gives you an array of results
[13:47:47] <Cork> you don't have a selector
[13:47:55] <sudormf> god fucking damn it, someone help me
[13:47:55] <styol> Cork: darn. I would simply make the appropriate modifications, but essentially I've been given code that is being adapted to a different platform where the original code essentially needs to be modified to make it's selections from a different DOM
[13:48:10] <sudormf> jquery mobile is the worst piece of shit ever
[13:48:16] <styol> well, modified at build time instead of creating a fork / divergence
[13:48:30] <Cork> styol: if you have an old version of jquery (pre 1.9)
[13:48:49] <Cork> you can do jqobject.selector
[13:48:49] <styol> sudormf: listen to the event and prevent default or return false, maybe
[13:48:58] <Cork> it was added to support .live
[13:49:07] <Cork> and was removed when they removed .live
[13:49:08] <sudormf> styol which event is it?
[13:49:12] <styol> Cork: hmmm will check what version
[13:49:24] <styol> sudormf: hashchange http://api.jquerymobile.com/category/events/
[13:49:41] <Cork> styol: but you get your self into a upgrade nightmare if you do that
[13:49:48] <Cork> so you should prob stay away from it
[13:51:02] <styol> Cork: good point
[13:51:37] <Cork> styol: but your best option is prob to just have the caller send you the selector instead of the object
[13:52:09] <styol> Cork: I guess another way to put the goal is I've been given code I can't modify, unless I AST parse it and create my own version  while making builds
[13:52:53] <Cork> styol: and that code sends you a jquery array?
[13:53:12] <styol> Cork: the code expects various elements to be on the page when they're essentially being rendered to a different DOM
[13:53:38] <Cork> styol: ouch
[13:53:50] <styol> yeah its a fun one ;)
[13:53:56] <Cork> styol: if they run the selector then there isn't much you can do
[13:54:30] <styol> only thing I can come up with is finding all variances of $('#selector') $('#selector otherElem') and what not and changing them to provide the new DOM context
[13:54:41] <styol> as part of a build routine
[13:55:27] <Cork> styol: it this callbacks or something?
[13:55:49] <Cork> meaning are you setting the context of there environment?
[13:55:53] <styol> its all kinds of stuff, nested in puremvc
[13:56:26] <Daghdha> limitMultiFileUploads hurray
[13:56:26] <styol> hmm not sure i understand what you mean regarding setting the context
[13:57:04] <Cork> styol: are you triggering the code that gives you the response
[13:57:09] <Cork> or are they triggering you
[13:57:19] <Cork> that is basically the core of the question
[13:57:39] <Daghdha> ow :( It's not for that
[13:58:18] <styol> Cork: oh I'm basically not adding any code, just adapating existing code to a platform where certain display areas like a div are essentially being converted into what somewhat equates to an iframe
[13:59:19] <Cork> styol: that is about the dom structure
[13:59:22] <Cork> not the code flow
[13:59:49] <Cork> styol: or are you saying the code you use is a complete app?
[14:06:39] <styol> Cork: complete app, yuppers
[14:07:00] <Daghdha> am i correct that to limit number of files allowed to be upload in drag and drop with blueimp i need to handle it myself in the .add event?
[14:07:03] <Cork> styol: ah, that explains a lot
[14:07:26] <styol> Cork: it is done in the puremvc framework which is also blowing my mind a little bit
[14:08:09] <zorak8> hi, im using this jquery widget http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker
[14:08:21] <zorak8> and im trying to add to the input the hour and the minute
[14:09:02] <zorak8> but cant find anything in the API
[14:10:28] <chinoto> Coworker seems to want to turn this project into an unmaintainable mess...
[14:10:49] <__joshua___> welcome to the workforce.
[14:11:24] <chinoto> Hardcoding the exact same thing multiple times into an onclick >.<
[14:11:39] <__joshua___> inline?
[14:11:41] <chinoto> Meet event delegation!
[14:11:47] <chinoto> aye :(
[14:11:51] <__joshua___> ew gross
[14:11:52] <chinoto> attribute.
[14:13:21] <chinoto> I've used onclick before, but I've quickly learned things that make it feel unnecessarily difficult to use, even for a quick job.
[14:14:12] <chinoto> There's other shit, but that's the current gripe.
[14:18:22] <zorak8> how can i implement this to a rails app?? http://puna.net.nz/timepicker.htm#
[14:20:07] <Hyperking> where is the chat log?
[14:20:09] <antlong> has anyone implemented jquery-ui-contextmenu?
[14:20:23] <Cork> Hyperking: check the title
[14:24:27] <wa5ted> any one here attached to ##design
[14:24:34] <wa5ted> can you ask flame why im banned from the channel
[14:25:16] <antlong> "because he sucks"
[14:26:46] <Cork> wa5ted: why don't you just msg him yourself?
[14:27:02] <wa5ted> tried

[14:31:41] <buddyq> can someone help me with a colorpicker? I have it all setup and it works but on blur of the colorpicker element, it completely disappears from the page. Some bug I cant figure out.
[14:31:46] <rogi> is there a shortcut for $('body').on('click', '.myClass', handler); ?
[14:32:15] <systemfault> rogi: Why would there be? It’s not short enough?
[14:32:16] <Cork> rogi: no, though when you go for $('body') you can just as well go for $(document)
[14:32:34] <Cork> and skip the dom selector
[14:32:45] <rogi> good tip, thanks
[14:32:52] <buddyq> The colorpicker is used for settings site params so its not public. I would like to hire someone to fix this litlte annoying bug. PM me if interested.
[14:32:57] <rogi> systemfault: I can't know what I don't know, can I?
[14:39:16] <buddyq> Anyone for hire in here?
[14:40:20] <wa5ted> buddyq: what do you need
[14:40:31] <buddyq> posted above…
[14:40:37] <wa5ted> cant see it
[14:40:40] <wa5ted> i just joined
[14:40:50] <buddyq> colorpicker bug. Colorpicker disappears when you click off of it.
[14:40:56] <wa5ted> hmmm
[14:41:01] <wa5ted> any code i can look at
[14:41:03] <buddyq> it works and holds its settings. But nasty that it disappears.
[14:41:06] <wa5ted> live example
[14:41:18] <buddyq> yea, but lets go pm. Takes user/pass
[14:41:18] <wa5ted> or is it the html5 color picker
[14:41:26] <rogi> is .detach() redundant when moving elements with insertAfter?
[14:42:01] <damiano> hello
[14:42:35] <damiano> i have to fadeout and scroll from top to bottom...i mean open the div rising its height
[14:42:37] <damiano> is this possible?
[14:43:59] <__joshua___> not quite sure what you are asking, but yes, you can animate fade, scroll, height
[14:44:50] <damiano> __joshua___, pardon...yes i mean...i would like to "open" a div rising its height
[14:45:32] <__joshua___> $('div').hide().slideDown();  try that
[14:45:59] <__joshua___> there are plenty of premade animations in jquery ui, else using animate() is pretty straight forward
[14:46:18] <damiano> qhat is the differences between $('div').hide().slideDown() and .animate() ?
[14:46:21] <damiano> i try the first..
[14:47:08] <damiano> yeah!! slideDown() is what i meant!
[14:47:14] <damiano> now i have to slow down the motion
[14:47:15] <__joshua___> hide() sets display to none,  slideDown sets display to block, height to zero, then animate({height: auto}, 300);  (im totally guessing this btw)
[14:47:28] <__joshua___> http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/   //takes a duration argument
[14:48:07] <damiano> perfect!!!
[14:48:23] <damiano> __joshua___, can i also add fadein with scrolldown ?
[14:48:50] <__joshua___> you bet.  try adding .fadeIn(); might work
[14:49:10] <Blinky_> Hi guys, is this all I need to load a file into a div with an id of content? - $( "#content" ).load( "includes/home.php" );
[14:49:10] <__joshua___> do it before slideDown, maybe
[14:49:23] <__joshua___>  $('div').hide().fadeIn().slideDown()
[14:50:24] <damiano> __joshua___, i see the fadein but not the scroll
[14:50:53] <__joshua___> oh sorry, didn't see you wanted scroll down.  what do you mean by that?
[14:51:12] <damiano> __joshua___, pardon ...i meant slideDown()
[14:51:19] <damiano> if i also use fadeIn() i do not see slideDown()
[14:51:33] <__joshua___> kk.  lemme actually try it
[14:51:37] <damiano> i see the div opened
[14:51:38] <damiano> ok
[14:57:53] <Blinky_> Any ideas what I am doing wrong?  I have the link to the jquery.min.js in the header file and this in the index - http://pastebin.com/Rpejpehy
[14:58:15] <duch_kazatel> #content doesn't exist yet.
[14:58:20] <duch_kazatel> you want the document ready.
[14:58:38] <Blinky_> How do I get the document ready?
[14:58:47] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery document ready
[14:58:48] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: $( document ).ready() | jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[14:58:52] <duch_kazatel> ^^ read that.
[14:59:46] <duch_kazatel> $(document).ready(function() { /* your code here */ }); is the basic gist of it.
[15:00:38] <chinoto> Also $(function() {...})
[15:00:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah that does the same thing.
[15:00:54] <chinoto> back to lurking :P
[15:01:00] <Blinky_> cheers guys, I shall go have a read
[15:02:57] <__joshua___> sorry damiano: got distracted.   http://jsfiddle.net/k3rD6/1/
[15:03:26] <damiano> __joshua___, ok perfect!
[15:03:27] <damiano> thank you!
[15:06:06] <randomDude000> Hey people, when I do $(document).on('keyup','input',function(event){console.log(event)}); I never see any enter keys or backspace being fired up. (I didn't try other control keys).
[15:06:40] <erming> randomDude000: try $("document").on("keyup input", function() { ... }); instead
[15:06:41] <randomDude000> But when I do $('input').keyup(function(event){console.log(event)}); - that works just fine
[15:06:52] <duch_kazatel> also check keypress
[15:07:00] <randomDude000> duch_kazatel: I checked keypress
[15:07:08] <randomDude000> erming: I'll try that
[15:07:20] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/150/ <--- All i am trying to do here is remove <p> from within .description and then i will want to replace <p> with a new <div class="">
[15:07:27] <bigLanky> any ideas what im missing here?
[15:07:53] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky you want to replace the P with a new div?
[15:08:06] <bigLanky> yes
[15:08:22] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/replacewith/
[15:08:54] <duch_kazatel> also see if you can't use a more recent version of jquery.
[15:09:00] <bigLanky> how do i change the selector to include 2 elements
[15:09:06] <bigLanky> i need to select .description p
[15:09:16] <bigLanky> will it work if i put both in there?
[15:09:16] <duch_kazatel> the same way you wuld with CSS...
[15:09:23] <bigLanky> ok let me try this
[15:09:50] <bigLanky> perfect
[15:09:55] <bigLanky> replaceWith worked great
[15:09:57] <bigLanky> thanks duch_kazatel
[15:10:01] <duch_kazatel> yep
[15:10:50] <bigLanky> what would be the best way to grab the text from within <p> so i can reinsert it in replacewith
[15:10:54] <bigLanky> because i still need the content
[15:10:54] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/152/
[15:10:57] <erming> bigLanky
[15:11:01] <erming> one way to do it
[15:11:07] <bigLanky> nice
[15:11:07] <duch_kazatel> .text()
[15:11:07] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: usually nicer
[15:11:24] <randomDude000> erming: It didn't work.. Why doesn't it capture the enter key??
[15:11:44] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet this is a bubbling issue.
[15:11:51] <erming> not sure that you can capture enter on $(document)
[15:12:34] <randomDude000> I'll try using a different element
[15:13:31] <erming> randomDude000
[15:13:31] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/2qRQ8/
[15:13:33] <erming> this worked for me
[15:13:50] <erming> click on "Hello" once, so the iframe gets focused
[15:14:17] <randomDude000> erming: Yeahh
[15:14:22] <randomDude000> It was document
[15:14:27] <randomDude000> It doesn't work on document
[15:14:30] <randomDude000> Thanks =]
[15:14:42] <erming> ah ok.. nice that you got it working :>
[15:17:01] <randomDude000> erming: It doesn't work on body either
[15:17:11] <bigLanky> erming, i plugged this in and here are my results... original HTML: http://screencast.com/t/TlVD3MN3976 and the new HTML: http://screencast.com/t/GWPNczbFx3
[15:17:20] <bigLanky> for some reason it is concat on the content
[15:19:24] <erming> randomDude000 how does the rest of the code look like
[15:19:39] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/153/ <--- this example has my HTML
[15:19:40] <erming> because this might cause an issue: "keyup" returns e.which, "input" does not
[15:20:03] <erming> randomDude000, try to create two .on("", fn);
[15:20:07] <erming> one for keyup and one for input
[15:20:46] <erming> bigLanky: nice
[15:20:49] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/154/
[15:20:52] <bigLanky> thats the one
[15:20:53] <erming> bigLanky it works as you want it to?
[15:21:48] <erming> ah, didnt see your message about concatenation
[15:21:57] <bigLanky> well, the text that reads "Please set a quantity. Please describe what you are looking for" is actually a combination of the quanaity and description fields
[15:22:28] <erming> you need a better selector than .description
[15:22:34] <bigLanky> ok
[15:22:47] <erming> just $(".description") gets all of them
[15:22:58] <erming> you will have to create some kind of scope, just fetching them one by one
[15:23:13] <bigLanky> yeah thats what i need to do is loop through somehow
[15:24:11] <erming> bigLanky
[15:24:12] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/156/
[15:24:41] <bigLanky> ah grea tthanks
[15:24:42] <bigLanky> let me try that
[15:25:21] <bigLanky> that worked!
[15:25:23] <bigLanky> thanks erming!
[15:25:49] <erming> np! :)
[15:33:10] <bigLanky> erming: can you take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/157/
[15:33:37] <bigLanky> i am trying to get the output to have <div class='tiptext'>?<div class='desc'>text</div></div>
[15:34:02] <bigLanky> with this code, my output is <div class="tiptext">description text</div>
[15:36:26] <erming> bigLanky: http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/158/
[15:36:36] <erming> try that one
[15:37:23] <bigLanky> this one only has <div class="description">text</div>
[15:59:07] <mg983> I have the attached JS using jQuery. How can I attach a callback when the $.each is complete?
[15:59:09] <mg983> http://pastebin.com/GV6Mq0FJ
[15:59:33] <duch_kazatel> is each async?
[16:01:16] <mg983> its nonblocking
[16:03:16] <duch_kazatel> you sure about that?
[16:03:20] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/HnW4f/
[16:04:09] <mg983> weird
[16:04:12] <mg983> it's running asynch for me
[16:04:19] <mg983> not your example, my example
[16:04:45] <duch_kazatel> mind showing?
[16:06:15] <mg983> its tied to my local machine in a wordpress install
[16:06:38] <mg983> could the posts be nonblocking
[16:06:41] <mg983> and it runs through it quickly?
[16:07:06] <duch_kazatel> $.post() is async, yes
[16:07:17] <duch_kazatel> $.post() uses $.ajax() under the hoo
[16:07:31] <duch_kazatel> *hood - so if you put code after that call, that explains it.
[16:07:47] <mg983> should i add a callback and a counter
[16:07:48] <duch_kazatel> anything that relies on content from the $.post() needs to be in its .done() callback.
[16:08:03] <mg983> and check in the promise to the post if the count === array.length
[16:08:03] <mg983> ?
[16:08:08] <mg983> i wonder if that'll work
[16:08:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/HnW4f/1/
[16:08:37] <duch_kazatel> not even that complicated.
[16:12:11] <mg983> let's see
[16:12:20] <mg983> that code is identical to the code i posted
[16:12:52] <duch_kazatel> look at the comment in there.
[16:13:31] <mg983> yeah i saw it
[16:13:34] <mg983> i tried that originally
[16:13:38] <mg983> that runs before the loop ends
[16:13:46] <duch_kazatel> and you're inside the post?
[16:14:04] <duch_kazatel> is processUser() async?
[16:14:31] <mg983> yes
[16:14:47] <duch_kazatel> there's your issue.
[16:17:10] <jenia> how do you get the next 3 siblings lets say?
[16:17:34] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/nextuntil/
[16:17:56] <duch_kazatel> you can also call .next() three times, but that's a little hacky.
[16:18:19] <jenia> nextuntil. thanks duch_kazatel
[16:18:19] <bigLanky> content: .val(text)  <--- what is the proper syntax for this?
[16:18:31] <bigLanky> the script i found simply had      content: 'some string of text'
[16:18:37] <bigLanky> but i want to replace that string with a var i have set above
[16:18:41] <bigLanky> var text
[16:18:48] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky are you editing the text?
[16:18:57] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky or the value of an input?
[16:19:08] <bigLanky> var text = desc.find("p").text();
[16:19:15] <bigLanky> i am just grabbing the content within <p>
[16:19:34] <duch_kazatel> what are you running the .val() call against?
[16:20:52] <duch_kazatel> setting the value of something is as easy at $('input').val(someValue);
[16:24:06] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/165/ is my code
[16:24:10] <bigLanky> check line 10
[16:24:14] <bigLanky> im trying to set that as a variable
[16:24:46] <bigLanky> maybe im going about this the wrong way
[16:24:53] <bigLanky> im just trying to do a simple qtip on hover popup
[16:26:37] <duch_kazatel> line 10 of what?
[16:26:42] <duch_kazatel> your js?

[16:34:35] <duch_kazatel> you mean propagate?
[16:35:03] <regedit> yes

[16:40:23] <duch_kazatel> if not - how do i replicate the bug?
[16:40:33] <regedit> put some items in your cart, then reload the page and try clicking on the cart icon in top-right corner
[16:40:52] <regedit> ctrl+R complete refresh
[16:41:26] <duch_kazatel> $('#rf-cart').on('click','#shop-bag',function(evt){ - this only binds a listener to the parent.
[16:41:30] <duch_kazatel> not the child.
[16:41:56] <regedit> fair enough, but why is it not handling it?
[16:42:04] <duch_kazatel> the entire site doesn't work for me.
[16:42:15] <regedit> #shop-bag is inside the #rf-cart element
[16:42:24] <Daghdha> me neither, i tried it with chrome
[16:42:27] <regedit> at least structurally
[16:42:32] <duch_kazatel> the entire site doesn't do anything for me, regedit
[16:42:36] <duch_kazatel> i can't click any products.
[16:43:13] <duch_kazatel> don't use return false; on line 68
[16:43:21] <regedit> hm you're right something is fundamentally messed up...
[16:43:31] <regedit> oh whoopsie
[16:43:56] <regedit> ok fixed that
[16:44:52] <regedit> the listener on <body> line 64 is supposed to collapse the mini cart when user clicks away
[16:45:08] <duch_kazatel> the shop-bag is not a child of rf-cart
[16:45:20] <regedit> if you are correct, please shoot me
[16:45:41] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/M3p73p8.png
[16:45:45] <duch_kazatel> that's how it's currently rendered.
[16:47:16] <regedit> ok so now it's directly on #shop-bag
[16:47:37] <regedit> i think that whole if statement isn't running when it should...
[16:47:52] <regedit> gtr I shall investigate further,t hanks muchly duch_kazatel
[16:48:25] <duch_kazatel> looks like you're convoluting your logic.  i'd avoid doing a doc ready then a secondary listener like you are.
[16:49:05] <regedit> there are these events 'wc_fragments_loaded wc_fragments_refreshed added_to_cart' which can happen at random times
[16:49:14] <regedit> they completely replace a chunk of elements
[16:49:28] <regedit> so i need to re-bind listeners when that happens
[16:49:36] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[16:49:41] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're asking for a world of hurt.
[16:49:45] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/c9fQj/2/ <---- can anyone see where how this is different from http://jsfiddle.net/craga89/G2sqU/ (working example)
[16:49:52] <bigLanky> on the first link, hovering over the ? mark just removes the text
[16:50:11] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky really?
[16:50:15] <regedit> duch_kazatel: "delegates" means .on('event', 'selector' ...) ?
[16:50:31] <bigLanky> ?
[16:50:32] <duch_kazatel> regedit right, but if you need to re-bind those, you're doing something wrong.
[16:50:36] <duch_kazatel> bigkevmcd the document ready...
[16:50:42] <duch_kazatel> woops i mean bigLanky
[16:51:02] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/c9fQj/3/
[16:51:06] <bigLanky> doesnt make a difference
[16:51:10] <regedit> duch_kazatel: right but with .on(...) i shouldnt need to rebind, right?
[16:51:20] <regedit> duch_kazatel: or is there something else im doing wrong
[16:52:30] <bigLanky> ah there it was.. was just flaoting off the page
[16:52:34] <duch_kazatel> regedit text tells me you want the text..
[16:52:55] <regedit> duch_kazatel: huh?
[16:53:03] <duch_kazatel> err, bigLanky
[16:53:04] <duch_kazatel> sorry.
[16:53:07] <duch_kazatel> out of it today
[16:53:22] * regedit slaps a trout around a bit with a large duch_kazatel
[16:53:40] * duch_kazatel slaps regedit around a bit with a large trout
[16:54:17] <regedit> congrats! you are the first to have written that out in full since anyone did it last in 1999
[16:54:26] <duch_kazatel> i didn't write it ;)
[16:54:30] <regedit> :P
[16:54:36] <duch_kazatel> mIRC has is as context menu option.
[16:54:36] <regedit> oh? auto trout feature?
[16:54:41] <regedit> hah mIRC
[16:54:46] <regedit> i remember that one
[16:54:49] <regedit> very quaint
[16:55:02] <duch_kazatel> the only not-awful windows IRC client.
[16:57:41] <Daghdha> I have this in my page and am not sure where it's set or if it's configurable <div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="0" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100" style="width: 0%;"><span class="sr-only">0% complete</span></div>
[16:58:01] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha huh?
[16:58:08] <duch_kazatel> oh you're nopt sure where it's coming from?
[16:58:10] <Daghdha> It is used by fileupload, and the progress bar seems to be.. tweened, dampenend. Not instant. If you know what i mean
[16:58:35] <Daghdha> Well, i put it there :) It came with the blueimp example
[16:59:06] <duch_kazatel> "not instant"?
[16:59:12] <duch_kazatel> you mean "has a delay"?
[16:59:55] <Daghdha> no as in it 'slides' . Say it's 10 and you set it to 80 it'snot 80 instantly. It grows there. Very rapipdly. But it'snot instant
[17:00:23] <duch_kazatel> ah, want to turn that off?
[17:00:29] <Daghdha> yes.
[17:00:38] <Daghdha> I think it's sometimes referred to as ease-in
[17:00:56] <duch_kazatel> link to docs?
[17:01:15] <Daghdha> But i think it may be bootsrap default behaviour
[17:01:24] <Daghdha> I think it is bootstrap
[17:01:46] <duch_kazatel> did you try asking in the bootstrap room?
[17:02:13] <Daghdha> I was not aware of such a room. I shall look trough i 1st now i know it'sbootstrap
[17:02:35] <duch_kazatel> there should be one, at least.
[17:04:48] <mg983> duch_kazatel: i can just tell $.ajax to async: false
[17:04:49] <mg983> btw
[17:05:10] <duch_kazatel> i would avoid that if at all possible.
[17:07:45] <duch_kazatel> i'm aware of that option, but it's usually not the answer
[17:08:00] <Daghdha> i broke it :/
[17:08:08] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha hrm?
[17:09:39] <Daghdha> Oh some error somewhere, i will find it
[17:31:24] <Daghdha> oops
[17:31:45] <Daghdha> I moved a piece of code to a javascript file. But i use asp.net to fill a var there :/
[17:32:02] <duch_kazatel> have the asp page output the value then.
[17:32:05] <duch_kazatel> and then read it.
[17:33:24] <Daghdha> i am passing it as a parameter now, just took me a while to find it. It's valid syntax
[17:35:06] <kedgen> Can anyone recommend an elegant way to write page-specific code? Right now I'm using if($('element').length > 0) but it feels really messy to me :\
[17:35:18] <kedgen> *page-specific jquery
[17:35:28] <duch_kazatel> kedgen not following - you mean only run stuff if an element exists?
[17:35:52] <duch_kazatel> because you don't need to check the length first.  otherwise, split your stuff into files.
[17:36:04] <duch_kazatel> and only include files on the pages they'll be used.
[17:36:05] <kedgen> duch_kazatel: yes. I'm actually specifically using wordpress, and I have code that only runs on certain pages, but the js file is on every page.
[17:36:16] <kedgen> duch_kazatel: that is a great idea. So simple! thank you
[17:41:24] <chinoto> kedgen: Or you could continue having a single file, but wrap certain code chunks in functions that will then be called by each page. I'd only recommend that if it's small stuff to save on requests and being able to cache a single file.
[17:41:51] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/167/ <--- on hover i am trying to show the .description field, but it is triggering for all .description divs
[17:41:56] <bigLanky> how can i set this to just do it one at a time
[17:42:42] <chinoto> I need to get home, seeya
[17:42:49] <kedgen> chinoto: How would you suggest calling the page specific functions?
[17:43:04] <kedgen> just trying to clean up my code a bit
[17:43:10] <duch_kazatel> bigLanky check out .siblings()
[17:44:34] <chinoto> kedgen: You just make the functions global, then on pages that need something special, you stick in <script>page1_func();</script> after the script tag that fetches the big js file.
[17:45:05] <chinoto> or whatever the function is that you made.
[17:45:15] <kedgen> chinoto: I like that idea. I'm trying to improve performance in this case so this is probably the better options here
[17:45:26] <chinoto> :)
[17:45:35] <__joshua___> making things global isn't usually a good idea.
[17:45:35] <kedgen> thanks :)
[17:45:37] <duch_kazatel> multiple file requests aren't a bad thing btw - it's all about tradeoffs.
[17:46:07] <lj1102> hello, is there an option i can toggle on jquery ajax function that allows to ignore result status codes ? I my callback to be always called even when the server returns 500 or 404.
[17:46:28] <chinoto> __joshua___: That's more of a rule of thumb, but it isn't the be all end all.
[17:46:28] <__joshua___> browsers generally can do 6-10 concurrent requests to the same domain.  so after 6 files, consider building.
[17:46:30] <kedgen> duch_kazatel: I guess I just don't like the look and "feel" of the way I'm doing it now. There are body classes but something about using if($('body').hasClass('page') {} feels messy
[17:46:45] <bigLanky> duch_kazatel where would i throw .siblings() in?
[17:46:48] <__joshua___> chinoto: thus the 'usually'.
[17:46:50] <duch_kazatel> lj1102 look at .always();
[17:47:02] <chinoto> __joshua___: k
[17:47:13] <lj1102> duch_kazatel: i did but it also does not get called on a 500 :/
[17:47:16] <duch_kazatel> kedgen aye - that's why we have shared "global" files, and then page specific ones.
[17:47:45] <duch_kazatel> lj1102 that sounds wrong to me.
[17:48:05] <__joshua___> chinoto: perhaps a better idea is 'make your functions have as few global side effects as possible'.  aim for zero.
[17:48:19] <chinoto> kedgen: Speaking of which, I need to rip the 10KiB worth of javascript out of our index file...
[17:49:12] <kedgen> chinoto does that mean you have to go? haha
[17:49:33] <chinoto> I think it was actually 12KiB. The whole thing is 25KiB on a blank page.
[17:49:50] <kedgen> chinoto: oh wow, what for?
[17:50:35] <lj1102> duch_kazatel: you're right, i've just retried it, weird... thanks
[17:50:43] <duch_kazatel> fsho
[17:53:03] * Daghdha declares his progressbar behaviour a feature. done :P
[17:55:53] <lj1102> ah forgot to rebuild my sources, mystery solved...
[17:56:33] <Daghdha> Anyone here use draggable? Can i get a link for a site you use it in?
[17:57:03] <duch_kazatel> Daghdha what are you looking for specifically?
[17:57:28] <Daghdha> I can drag a draggable real vast down, and it will become positioned outside the viewport
[17:57:39] <Daghdha> I wonder if it's soething i do or if default draggable has it
[17:58:00] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui draggables?
[17:58:04] <Daghdha> yes
[17:58:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jqueryui.com/draggable/
[18:00:01] <chinoto> kedgen: All that's on the index file visually, is a navigation bar on top. The bulk of the html is just the <header/>. As for the javascript, it handles resizing the header with window resizing, initializes a modal dialog and a convenience function for it, puts a stub function in for flowplayer so it can be pulled in as needed, sets up autocomplete for contact searching, initializes tooltipster for many of the navigation icons, starts up some
[18:00:01] <chinoto>  recursing timeouts to update some stats and check for reminders, and whole litany of other tiny things.
[18:00:59] <Daghdha> It gives a scrollbar if i try to replicate. WIch is good. I guess i need similar setting on parent div
[18:01:56] <chinoto> Anyway, I've stayed longer than I intended, seeya
[18:12:52] <oldboyFX> I'm new to IRC. Can anyone see this? :P
[18:13:09] <htmlius> hello
[18:13:35] <oldboyFX> ^_^ hi
[18:15:25] <oldboyFX> I'm having a hard time trying to figure something out
[18:16:07] <oldboyFX> Im working on an infinite scroll page, and I want to add class to all elements that arent in viewport
[18:16:29] <oldboyFX> and remove that class from elements that are in viewport, while scrolling
[18:18:15] <oldboyFX> There can be like 5000 elements on the page so I can't do retarded stuff like looping through them and taking measurements on each throttled scroll event
[18:19:21] <Daghdha> Don't you just load them when needed from server? Or is it normal for these lists toe be prepopulated? I always thought they would just do another server hit for more with JSON or something
[18:20:00] <oldboyFX> Ofcourse the new items are loaded with ajax when youre near the bottom of the page
[18:20:24] <oldboyFX> But once 200+ items (images) are loaded, the scrolling performance suffers
[18:20:36] <oldboyFX> it becomes more choppy as more images are loaded
[18:21:14] <oldboyFX> If you add visibility hidden to elements that arent in viewport, the scrolling is super smooth
[18:21:17] <oldboyFX> ^_^
[18:22:00] <oldboyFX> i tried this http://airbnb.github.io/infinity/
[18:22:18] <oldboyFX> but it doesnt work well
[18:22:22] <oldboyFX> tbh
[18:22:34] <oldboyFX> and its abandoned as far as I can see
[18:24:27] <Daghdha> infinite scroll has last update 2 years ago i think
[18:28:54] <BillCriswell> Damn it's hot.
[18:29:28] <Daghdha> 10C here..
[18:29:54] <bigLanky> can anyone provide guidance on how I can get http://jsfiddle.net/vm57t/168/ to not hide/unhide all instances of .description?
[18:30:13] <bigLanky> duch suggested .siblings() but i was unable to find a way to work that in
[18:30:23] <bigLanky> when you hover over the yellow ? it should reveal the text for that line only
[18:30:45] <BillCriswell> I'd kill for 10C
[18:30:54] <Daghdha> this GUI development is like crack cocain. Youc an always get it better and nicer and smoother and keep going. It never ends.
[18:31:18] <BillCriswell> It's about 28C here... at 9:30 at night.
[18:31:31] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Yeah, good times.
[18:33:29] <oldboyFX> Yep, I can already see it.
[18:33:35] <oldboyFX> I'll loose 30 hours on this.
[18:33:39] <oldboyFX> well then :d
[18:45:02] <htmlius> If I have $(this).closest("tr").find("select")
[18:45:09] <htmlius> How do I select the first item in the dropdown?
[18:47:03] <BillCriswell> htmlius: If you have that saved to a var you can do like $select.find('option').eq(0);
[18:47:53] <htmlius> Thanks. Is it $(select) or $select?
[18:48:11] <BillCriswell> htmlius: It wuold b whatever that select element is.
[18:48:23] <BillCriswell> htmlius: $(this).closest("tr").find("select").find('option').eq(0)
[18:48:33] <BillCriswell> or even $(this).closest("tr").find("select option").eq(0)
[18:48:43] <BillCriswell> but I wasn't sure if you hve the select for a specific reason.
[18:48:45] <htmlius> sorry I didn't explain. Yes I had it saved to a var
[18:48:55] <htmlius> var mySelect = $(this).closest("tr").find("select");
[18:49:05] <htmlius> to use it is it $(mySelect) or $mySelect - syntax wise
[18:49:21] <BillCriswell> htmlius: That would be just mySelect.find('option').eq(0)
[18:49:37] <htmlius> okay, thanks
[18:49:37] <BillCriswell> Since mySelect is already a jQuery object.
[18:49:46] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:01:39] <Daghdha> Why is there no .replaceClass  ?
[19:03:58] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Would be easy enough to write your own.
[19:04:44] <Daghdha> hence my puzzlement why it is not a default item.
[19:05:26] <BillCriswell> I'm personally pissed because there isn't a plusThree function.
[19:05:27] <Daghdha> I will just use $("#item").attr('class', ''); insteadthat should work right?
[19:05:58] <jphase> nah
[19:06:03] <jphase> that'll wipe out the whole class attribute
[19:06:08] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: Oh you want to replace the whole class attribute?
[19:06:28] <jphase> $.fn.replaceClass = function(oldclass, newclass) { $(this).removeClass(oldclass).addClass(newclass); }
[19:06:37] <jphase> if you HAVE to have replaceClass lol :P
[19:07:15] <BillCriswell> (function($){ $.fn.replaceClass = function(oldclass, newclass) { $(this).removeClass(oldclass).addClass(newclass); } })(jQuery); just to be safe.
[19:07:21] <jayar> after i .animate() from left to right, how do i set it back to the left, without having it "animate" back?
[19:08:02] <BillCriswell> jayar: Do it in the complete callback? $(this).css('left', 0); you mean?
[19:09:03] <jayar> $(".shine").animate(left:"4500",1750)
[19:09:39] <Daghdha> I will just use $("#item").attr('class', 'SuperBestClass');
[19:09:44] <Daghdha> well i try it now
[19:09:58] <Daghdha> Seems to work
[19:10:07] <Daghdha> SO that's probably why replace is non existing :P
[19:10:29] <jphase> Daghdha: that's not replacing though since if you have more than one class it will destroy the entire class attribute
[19:10:32] <BillCriswell> Daghdha: You're removing all the existing classes when do do that.
[19:11:03] <jphase> I think they don't have replace because it's so darned easy to just do $('.test').removeClass('test').addClass('newclass');
[19:11:07] <jphase> :\
[19:11:10] <BillCriswell> jayar: Put that in the callback... but it should be $('.shine').animate({left: '4500px'}, 1750);
[19:11:21] <BillCriswell> jphase: Exactly haha
[19:11:23] <Daghdha> it's for 3 buttons i am toggelinn class for, they behave like radio buttons.
[19:11:37] <jayar> k
[19:14:14] <BillCriswell> I just ate the best apple ever.
[19:22:41] <jphase> nothing like an epic apple or orange
[19:23:13] <CloudyOne> yes there is, apple pears are just like it
[19:23:20] <CloudyOne> or rather epic pears*
[19:23:41] <Daghdha> Epic pairs are pretty nice too
[19:23:43] <jphase> I do love me a pear
[19:24:25] <CloudyOne> epic apple and epic orange make an epic pair
[19:24:30] <CloudyOne> fruit sex
[19:28:21] <BillCriswell> jphase: Agreed.
[19:32:22] * Daghdha checks it in and call sit a nightmorning
[19:32:30] <Daghdha> Thanks for helps, nn.
[19:34:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.

[21:02:58] <jaccob> who runs the javascript channel, they put me on a permanent ban. I wanna break in and take over, lol.
[21:13:10] <Zak> what sort of ban was it?
[21:18:00] <Zak> fyi, you automatically get banned if you're using a "guest" username ircc
[21:18:12] <Zak> i have to quit the channel, rename then rejoin
[21:18:54] <wa5ted> ???
[21:19:48] <Zak> its related to nickserv. if for some reason, your connection no longer is identified, you'll get renamed to a guest username. e.g. guest23451
[21:20:05] <Zak> usually happens if you d/c
[21:20:23] <Zak> you'll remain in the channel, but you won't be able to talk because you're "banned"
[22:19:42] <PrivateMethod> Good day folks!
[22:20:34] <PrivateMethod> Is anyone awake in these parts?
[22:22:51] <antlong_> anyone know of a good plugin for giving visitors badges (images)?
[22:49:08] <jphase> antlong_: hm?
[22:49:48] <antlong_> jphase badges, as in, "You Rule" or such, usually text on an image like this: http://vector4free.com/vector/7-web-20-badges-vector/
[22:50:19] <jphase> oh, hmmm no
[22:50:31] <jphase> would be pretty easy with css + an array of text though :)
[22:53:16] <antlong_> hmn
[23:05:27] <jotterbot1234> does anyone here use javascript templates ? https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-Templates
[23:07:47] <jphase> not that one :\
[23:45:50] <da30> 헐 챈섭이 여기도 있네;
[23:49:32] <Oreolek> hi. i'm not used to jq much.. how does one pass an $ object as parameter and modify DOM?
[23:51:08] <jphase> Oreolek: depends on how you want to modify the DOM really. you'll have to be a bit more specific
[23:52:31] <Oreolek> ok, it's something like this http://jsfiddle.net/p22N2/
[23:52:45] <Oreolek> i need append() to work
[23:54:40] <jphase> Oreolek: $(this) doesn't refer to anything inside populateBanner() in that case. what are you trying to pass in?
[23:55:00] <jphase> basically the way it works is you can pass in any jQuery DOM object - so it could be like $('.banner') for example
[23:55:16] <jphase> then banner would have all the jQuery DOM functions attached
[23:55:25] <Oreolek> $(this) that is passed is a $('.banner'), fadeout function works like each i suppose
[23:55:55] <Oreolek> i found that it calls fadeout for each .banner node
[23:56:03] <jphase> oic, missed that part actually
[23:56:06] <jphase> but yeah
[23:56:46] <Oreolek> so, no way to pass a jquery object with DOM functions?
[23:57:12] <jphase> well sure there is, you can pass in a DOM object  or just $ by itself
[23:57:56] <jphase> but $ is available everywhere in this scope so no need to do that
[23:58:32] <jphase> but if you had a function foo(bar) {  bar.fadeOut();  }    then you could do a  foo($('.something'));
[23:59:06] <Oreolek> i just wanted to speed it up
[23:59:18] <Oreolek> because fadeOut function is called for every .banner div
[23:59:33] <Oreolek> and i have a loop on each banner div in it
[23:59:53] <Oreolek> so it's twice the work for js
