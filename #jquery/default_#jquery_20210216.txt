[00:47:56] <twg> Anyone on right now?
[00:48:03] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[00:49:10] <twg> Sweet.  So I have this code (https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/2ncuhjv0/17/) and I'm trying to get my sub section filtering working as well as upcoming dates.  When I click on any of my sub sections they don't show the correct items based on the data-category attribute.
[00:50:18] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so if i click "Sub Section 1", what should happen?
[00:50:41] <twg> I want my list to only show items that have a data-category of sub-section-1
[00:51:11] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/BTBLUlA.png seems to be doing that just fine here.
[00:51:56] <twg> each button has 2 items associated to it.  Click on one of the others and see what it does for you.
[00:52:16] <robertmaxrees> gotcha, so start by clicking, say, sub section 3, then click another sub section.
[00:52:39] <twg> Yes.  I may be making this a lot more complicated that it needs to be.
[00:53:10] <robertmaxrees> so i see two major issues: first up: you're using filter as an each.
[00:53:11] <twg> I'm just trying to filter a list based on the category selected and then I added a reset to remove all "hidden" classes if they exist.
[00:53:28] <robertmaxrees> secondly, you're using toggleClass in that filter.
[00:54:08] <twg> Okay, so should I check and return the class and chain the toggle class to the filter?
[00:54:19] <twg> return true/false
[00:54:43] <robertmaxrees> that'll give you the same issue.  swap to an each, use addClass in that existing if, and then add an else that does a removeClass
[00:57:33] <robertmaxrees> you could actually simplify this much further.
[00:57:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/0hszpew1/2/ - you don't need to check if the elements have the class before removing it.
[00:58:59] <robertmaxrees> even further: https://jsfiddle.net/0hszpew1/3/
[00:59:41] <twg> Wow thanks robertmaxrees
[00:59:54] <twg> That was a big refactor.
[01:00:24] <robertmaxrees> depending on how complex the document is, there are some other things you could do to simplify, but this is a good start.
[01:01:19] <twg> This will be about this simple.  I might add another 10 items but that's it.
[01:01:53] <robertmaxrees> then you'll want something like this.  fwiw you don't need a preventDefault for cases like this.
[01:04:00] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[01:31:29] <twg> robertmaxrees Can I ask a question about sorting dates?
[01:31:33] <robertmaxrees> sure
[01:31:47] <robertmaxrees> (don't ask to ask btw - just ask ;) )
[01:32:20] <twg> so I have a <time datetime="mm-dd-yyy">mm dd</time>.  I'm sorting in ASC order but it's not actually sorting.
[01:32:28] <twg> I wasn't sure if you were still online or not.
[01:32:43] <robertmaxrees> just ask the channel :)  no need to ask me specifically lol.
[01:32:54] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what you're trying to do?
[01:35:52] <twg> Yes.  Updating the fiddle now
[01:38:53] <twg> https://jsfiddle.net/ThatWebGuy_/0Ljorw8t/7/
[01:40:25] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so a few issues.
[01:40:43] <twg> Okay.
[01:42:01] <robertmaxrees> so first up - check out what a.time is in that sort.
[01:42:35] <twg> It's a unix timestamp
[01:42:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jgq1Ly7k/
[01:42:43] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[01:43:23] <robertmaxrees> getting NaN there.
[01:44:38] <twg> Ahh
[01:45:08] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess that new Date() call isn't doing what you'd like.
[01:46:02] <twg> do i need to even convert it to a Date() to sort it?
[01:46:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[01:46:45] <robertmaxrees> also your code's confusing.  https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jgq1Ly7k/1/
[01:46:55] <robertmaxrees> the way you were nesting that new if was unusual.
[01:47:39] <robertmaxrees> though really you should be using classes to bind these handlers to so you don't need this conditional logic based on data attributes, but i digress.
[01:49:16] <robertmaxrees> also avoid placeholder vars: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jgq1Ly7k/3/ :)
[01:51:57] <twg> What do you mean by the last one?
[01:52:24] <robertmaxrees> instead of var obj = {}; then later assigning props, just return the object itself.
[01:52:49] <twg> Oh, okay.  Sorry
[01:53:01] <robertmaxrees> don't be sorry - just pointing it out :)
[01:53:21] <twg> Don't know if you can tell or not but jQuery isn't my strong point.
[01:54:11] <robertmaxrees> :) nah - jquery isn't the issue here fwiw.  everybody gets tripped up on date in JS.
[01:58:12] <twg> I changed my date format to Month dd, yyyy
[01:59:29] <robertmaxrees> did that fix it?
[02:01:24] <robertmaxrees> iirc new Date() wants a particular ISO format.
[02:01:27] <twg> No but now I see it's sorting by the day abbreviation added when converting it to a date.
[02:02:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i would do one of two things.  1: read the docs and make sure you're passing the right format in the first place (check the MDN docs for the date constructor), or 2: just use date-fns to make your life easier.
[02:08:32] <twg> Okay.
[10:18:41] <ThatWebGuy> Morning everyone.  I have a sort that is using a data-date attribute to sort my list.  If I want to reset it back to normal, what would be the best way?  Should I set some sort of attribute for original order?
