[00:01:53] <spoonUltra> O_O
[00:15:01] <Croug> hola spoonUltra
[00:15:13] <spoonUltra> Croug Hey there
[00:15:39] <Croug> spoonUltra, well you came in and didn't immediately start asking questions so I assume that means you know a thing or two about jq?
[00:16:54] <spoonUltra> Croug Not necessarily. I just didn't have anything to say at the moment.
[00:17:12] <Croug> spoonUltra, ah
[00:19:01] <Croug> spoonUltra, well do you at least know how to get a value from a dynamically created input box?
[00:19:19] <Croug> spoonUltra, because this just yields "undefined:undefined" alert($('ans1').va() + ":" + $('val1').val());
[00:19:28] <spoonUltra> Croug Do you have a codepen?
[00:19:42] <Croug> codepen?
[00:20:15] <spoonUltra> Croug It's easier to help when there's a version of it somewhere that I can look at. Codepen.io is pretty useful for that reason.
[00:20:53] <spoonUltra> Croug are you validating a form?
[00:21:13] <Croug> no I'm updating a database through javascript
[00:21:58] <Croug> spoonUltra, http://hastebin.com/etepolovaq.js
[00:22:08] <Croug> there's the code in it's entirety
[00:22:43] <JackFruh> I have what I hope is an easy question.
[00:22:45] <JackFruh> https://gist.github.com/jackfruh/c192f80119dc46729e57
[00:23:14] <JackFruh> in line 30 of the above gist, I'm trying to copy the HTML of a dragged object into a table cell
[00:23:49] <JackFruh> For example, I would drag a box on the screen that correlates to lines 55-62 of the gist above.
[00:24:11] <JackFruh> The problem I am having is that the wrapping div isn't getting copied
[00:24:21] <JackFruh> it's like it's grabbing innerhtml only
[00:24:33] <Croug> it is innerhtml only
[00:24:54] <JackFruh> ie line 56-61 copy, but not 55 and 62
[00:25:12] <JackFruh> Croug any way to grab those outer lines?
[00:25:46] <JackFruh> or should I wrap everything I want to copy in a placeholder div that has the draggable class?
[00:26:15] <JackFruh> (which would copy my formatting, but would then make it non-draggable once it gets dropped)
[00:26:46] <Croug> what I would recommend doing is just putting a div inside of the table cell and then populating the div with the html
[00:27:01] <Croug> but I'll google a bit see if there's a better way
[00:28:37] <JackFruh> Thanks Croug!
[00:29:47] <JackFruh> I just tried wrapping the source div with another div and making that one the draggable, that worked in terms of preserving formatting upon drop, I might be able to hard code in a <div class=draggable> + the html of the source + </div>
[00:30:50] <Croug> alright I figured out what you're gonna want to do
[00:31:28] <Croug> this answer explains how to copy all of the attributes from one element to another
[00:31:40] <Croug> so after you transfer the html like you are already doing
[00:31:46] <Croug> transfer the attribtues to the wrapper div
[00:31:47] <Croug> http://stackoverflow.com/a/6753486/2730161
[00:38:19] <Croug> JackFruh, did you get that?
[00:38:28] <JackFruh> Just reading the SO article now.
[00:38:30] <JackFruh> Thanks!
[00:38:35] <Croug> yup np
[00:58:07] <errakeshpd>  Have one doubt about one implementation, auto complete prediction showing in textbox (like place holder) instead of showing ul> li lists. How to implement this ?
[00:58:22] <errakeshpd> placeholder will help ?
[00:58:30] <errakeshpd> or data attribute ?
[00:58:46] <errakeshpd> not getting a solution for doing this..
[01:31:14] <iateadonut> j is an input.  if i do: j.val('something'); the value i see on the screen changes to 'something'.  if i do: j.val(); it then retrieves the value 'something'
[01:31:32] <iateadonut> however, if i change the value by typing in the input through the GUI, and then do j.val(), it retrieves the old value...
[01:31:44] <iateadonut> i would expect it to retrieve the value that is actually in the <input>
[01:43:14] <errakeshpd> <<iateadonut> $("#yourinput").val("errakeshpd") then $("#message-input").val() type something in textbox then $("#message-input").val() what you got ?
[01:43:41] <errakeshpd> message-input = yourinput_id

[05:57:12] <kazak1377> Hi, guys. I need some jQuery guru help. I have such dom '<span class='h'></span><div id='kaDiv'></div>'     How can i get the span object from div? Talking other words - i need to get the object, placed right above current object in dom.
[06:01:22] <Uhkis> kazak1377: prev()
[06:01:50] <kazak1377> Uhkis, Thank you. This is what i was looking.
[06:13:20] <AL13N_work> hi, can i like delegate an each event?
[06:13:25] <AL13N_work> or should i use something else?
[06:14:01] <Uhkis> there's no such event
[06:52:24] <anotheryou> hi, how do I compare an event targed to a jquery object? I want to do this:  $(".parent").click(function(event) {  if(event.target === $(".specialChild")){ //do stuff} });
[06:54:40] <anotheryou> ah, google helped, sorry to bother.. if ($(e.target).hasClass("selector"))
[07:01:39] <oftl> i just realised that maxHeight (and the resulting scrollbars) does not work <span>. only if a <div> is made a dialog that works as expected.
[07:01:43] <oftl> why is those things ?
[07:02:18] <Kristjanxx> hello. i get this error on AJAX: NetworkError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttpRequest': Failed to load
[07:02:18] <oftl> i mean: jQueryUI-dialog
[07:07:13] <Kristjanxx> hello. i get this error on AJAX: NetworkError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttpRequest': Failed to load http:myurl
[07:20:23] <anotheryou> how do i detect if a link is openened? Especially: external links + middle mouse button or right-click: open in new tab. Can I only detect mouse buttons, but not the opening?
[07:57:15] <jomofcw> Hello !
[07:58:35] <jomofcw> In the "complete" of a AJAX jQuery thing, how can I get the final called URL please ? e.g. I use the ajaxSubmit of jQuery Form, the form is on GET method, in the "complete" callback of the AJAX I wan't to get the URL called by the form with the GET parameters.
[08:07:53] <arc_> does anybody happen to know how i can get an <audio> element to actually update its src
[08:08:15] <arc_> just doing .prop('src', url); doesn't seem to actually change the sound
[08:10:34] <shoky> arc_ prolly .load() on the dom element
[08:16:47] <jbc8> is it possible to write a selector based on the .html() value of an element?
[08:17:17] <jbc8> for instance $('span[html=hello]')
[08:17:26] <jbc8> <span>hello</span>
[08:18:39] <shoky> jbc8 the closest thing jquery has is :contains() selector.. e.g. $('span:contains(hello)').   otherwise you can use .filter(function..)
[08:19:05] <arc_> shoky hmm so that won't work if it's cross domain
[08:19:49] <shoky> arc_ umm the .load() ?  if what's cross domain
[08:20:17] <arc_> if i'm trying to load an audio file from another domain
[08:20:35] <arc_> basically i'm trying to customize a notification sound via userscript
[08:21:30] <arc_> i've never used xmlhttprequest to load something like an mp3
[08:22:59] <shoky> if the server responds with cors headers it should work i think, xhr or not
[08:27:51] <M4urice> greetings! got a prob. very easy and general question: I want to change the text of a certain div-element, but somehow I can't call .text() on it (text is not a function).
[08:28:13] <M4urice> it only doesn't work within a certain function call. from console it works fine :/
[08:30:18] <M4urice> oh wow. never mind. I just found my stupid error (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻ |
[08:36:08] <greg_f> I convert unix timestamp to Date object but it returns my local Date: d = new Date(1458777600*1000); Thu Mar 24 2016 03:00:00 GMT+0300 (MSK). How to get Date object in UTC?
[08:41:16] <anotheryou> greg_f, i use moment.jn it's nice
[08:41:25] <anotheryou> moment.js
[08:41:58] <anotheryou> because timezones are madness :)
[08:42:01] <greg_f> anotheryou: thank you
[09:02:33] <jomofcw> In the "complete" of a AJAX jQuery thing, how can I get the final called URL please ? e.g. I use the ajaxSubmit of jQuery Form, the form is on GET method, in the "complete" callback of the AJAX I wan't to get the URL called by the form with the GET parameters.
[09:04:26] <taplar> could probably just get action off of the form
[09:05:32] <Velveeta> you'd probably want to just use something jQuery.param to construct the url variables and manually tack them on to what you passed in the url property
[09:06:09] <Velveeta> although if you're going w/ a jQuery Form plugin, you'll probably need the action fo the form like taplar suggested, and then manually construct the params to tack on
[09:06:40] <taplar> yeah, and from the api it looks like the form object is the 4th argument passed to success
[09:06:40] <rtd1123> Something like this: $('#someID').on("submit", function(event) { var url = $(this).attr('action'); }
[09:07:08] <taplar> http://jquery.malsup.com/form/#options-object search "success"
[09:08:03] <taplar> well you said complete callback...
[09:08:11] <taplar> herpa derp
[09:08:37] <Duikb00t> Hi taplar I have a question im doing research for creating a '1' page website with sections. But when you scroll the 'whole' section scrolls down.
[09:08:42] <Duikb00t> Which gives the user an other feeling of browsing.
[09:08:52] <Duikb00t> Any ideas how this is called?  its not parallax.
[09:09:14] <taplar> a one page website is called a SPA(Single Page Application)
[09:09:45] <taplar> are you saying you don't want them to scroll down?  not sure what your asking
[09:09:52] <Duikb00t> This is the effect http://onlinedepartment.nl/#clients
[09:10:05] <Duikb00t> Not sure this is the great/good plugin for it. http://alvarotrigo.com/blog/fullpage-jquery-plugin-for-fullscreen-scrolling-websites/
[09:10:18] <taplar> ah
[09:10:38] <taplar> not sure what the name of that is.
[09:10:58] <Duikb00t> Ok. :)
[09:11:08] <shoky> but the "other feeling of browsing" has a name - bad
[09:11:22] <taplar> not a fan of the jumpyness?
[09:11:40] <shoky> not a fan of sites taking over my scrolling
[09:11:46] <decx> i call it "snap to full views" bullshit
[09:11:50] <shoky> nor the jumpyness, yea
[09:11:52] <taplar> lol
[09:12:40] <decx> most websites aren't supposed to be fancy powerpoint presentations but are built as such
[09:13:02] <taplar> it most likely involves js, but you might ask ##css about it Duikb00t  they might know it's name
[09:13:21] <decx> get mwheel delta, transition to next offset
[09:13:27] <Duikb00t> Ok thanks
[09:13:27] <decx> it's not that involved
[09:13:36] <taplar> yeah
[09:14:41] <taplar> hah!  i broke it
[09:14:54] <taplar> hit "End" and then try to arrow up
[09:15:22] <taplar> hmm, maybe not
[09:15:43] <taplar> oh yeah
[09:15:48] <taplar> it doesn't account for home or end
[09:16:11] <Duikb00t> hahaha :D
[09:16:24] <taplar> s'what you get for being fancy, :)
[09:16:45] <Duikb00t> Hahaha, yes sometimes people ask really for creating that effect.
[09:18:30] <taplar> you don't work for those people do you?
[09:20:34] <Duikb00t> Talking to them helps a lot
[09:20:36] <Duikb00t> ;)
[09:21:09] <taplar> tell them about their issue then, :P  doesn't look good to have that kinda ui defect on a "user experience design" site, ;)
[09:21:35] * taplar runs to get a drink
[09:21:58] <jomofcw> taplar hello =) ! OK, but how can I get the data string as it has been sent, please ?
[09:23:22] <taplar> jomofcw: if your wanting the form data you could serialize the array
[09:23:47] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:24:03] <taplar> array = form
[09:24:58] <taplar> other than that, you might look at beforeSend
[09:25:12] <taplar> iirc the data that will be sent are passed into that
[09:25:15] <taplar> you could save it off for later
[09:25:23] <jomofcw> taplar hm OK... I'm looking for something more... universal... perhaps there is something in the jqXHR obejct that I can use.
[09:25:54] <jomofcw> Because I want to be sure to get the data that has effectively be sent to the request.
[09:26:00] <jomofcw> *in the request
[09:26:00] <decx> why do you want stuff that you sent yourself?
[09:26:30] <jomofcw> decx as it's depending of the form.
[09:26:45] <decx> so?
[09:28:21] <jomofcw> decx that's the jQuery from that construct the data. So not really me. So I just want to be sure to have exactly the right one that has been sent.
[09:30:24] <taplar> i'd probably try beforeSend
[09:31:45] <taplar> or beforeSubmit
[09:31:52] <taplar> that looks like an option with the jquery Form
[09:33:23] <jomofcw> OK, so I'll use the formSerialize in the formSubmit provided by  the jQuery form plugin. Thanks !
[09:51:07] <Duikb00t> Small other question : taplar you maybe know this one:
[09:51:20] <Duikb00t> imagina you have a one pager  ' SPA'
[09:51:39] <Duikb00t> You have a fluid container
[09:51:47] <Duikb00t> and in it 2 divs width: 50% or something...
[09:52:03] <Duikb00t> But when I scroll I want to slide in a image from the top of the left div and some text from the bottom on the right div .
[09:52:06] <Duikb00t> 'a scrolling effect'
[09:52:31] <Duikb00t> Has that a name?  Or is that just parallax wit a jquer inview combination?
[09:52:47] <taplar> that doesn't seem like parallax
[09:52:48] <Duikb00t> Or even a CSS animation which shows up as the div is 'inview' but then the scroll feeling is gone?
[09:53:51] <taplar> without context, that seems strange
[09:54:18] <decx> you'll have to keep state of elements separately
[09:54:25] <decx> and then extrapolate your animation
[09:54:28] <geri> hi, i would like to create a parameter dialog and before i going to render some stuff on canvas... how to achieve that? i guess there are multiple ways...
[09:54:36] <jomofcw> I'm using a History plugin, I call History.pushState({donnees:donnees,'$film_liste':$film_liste},adresse_complete,adresse_complete); where $film_liste is a jQuery object. When I perform a "console.dir($film_liste); it's not a full jQuery object anymore... why ?
[09:54:50] <decx> scrollY = 50 -> animation start, scrollY = 100 animation end, in between extrapolate
[09:55:38] <Duikb00t> http://www.web2feel.com/freeby/scroll-effects/index3.html
[09:55:51] <Duikb00t> Something alike that is what im looking for I think
[09:56:06] <taplar> geri: your wanting to create a dialog with content, and then afterwards put stuff on a canvas?
[09:56:20] <decx> that's just adding a class if you hit the element comes into view
[09:56:31] <Duikb00t> yes and shows the
[09:56:37] <decx> it's easy
[09:56:46] <geri> taplar: the user enters the number of objects and other things ... the number of objects are than drawed on the canvas
[09:56:55] <decx> element.offsetTop <= scrollY addclass
[09:57:21] <taplar> right, but conceptually.  show dialog, user does something with dialog, hide dialog, change canvas
[09:57:39] <decx> has nothing to do with dialog
[09:57:46] <taplar> k
[09:57:47] <decx> just have a method to update your canvas
[09:57:59] <decx> you can hook that into anything
[09:58:19] <geri> taplar: the dialog should only be visible at the beginning the user openes the page
[09:58:26] <geri> some sort of login...
[09:58:54] <geri> i created a simulation and need to set some parameters before it starts
[09:59:11] <decx> still has nothing to do with dialog
[09:59:23] <decx> just start the loop on dialog submit
[09:59:28] <decx> what's so complicated about that
[10:00:10] <geri> decx: i thought later on i will have a login which than opens the simulation.html
[10:10:06] <decx> so?
[10:10:23] <decx> create an options object from whatever you put in your dialog and call your init with that
[10:10:35] <geri> decx: does it make sense to make a index.html for the parameter dialog and simulation.html ?
[10:10:54] <decx> doesnt matter
[10:11:07] <decx> you either send your options object directly or as post
[10:11:10] <Gnjurac> hi
[10:11:11] <decx> doesnt change a thing
[10:11:25] <taplar> aloha
[10:12:21] <Gnjurac> hi i have a div that i on click  fadeOut , how can i read state   i want tomthing like if (#div1.fadedOut) { doSomthing}
[10:12:48] <taplar> iirc you can just check if it's visible
[10:13:08] <taplar> $(selector).is(':visible')
[10:13:36] <decx> keep track of the state of your app then you dont have to query the dom for this stuff
[10:13:37] <Gnjurac> ok ty
[10:13:39] <Gnjurac> will try
[10:14:39] <Gnjurac> taplar:  do i need to add that in if ( or i dont need js at all
[10:15:00] <taplar> that would be in your if
[10:15:23] <Gnjurac> so if ( $(selector).is(':visible') ) { do whatewer}
[10:15:28] <taplar> and instead of a selector, if you can use a cached variable of the object, it would be benificial
[10:15:31] <taplar> yep
[10:16:20] <Gnjurac> ok ty, about chacked you mean to add it to var? anywey its just 2 buttons so i think no perfomace loss
[10:16:39] <taplar> always good to reduce dom lookups
[10:17:25] <Gnjurac> so to make then var blabla = #div1
[10:18:13] <taplar> var $whatever = $(divSelector);  $whatever.fadeOut();  if ($whatever.is(':visible')) {}
[10:18:42] <Gnjurac> ok ty wery muhc
[10:21:36] <hellyeah> jquery ui datepicker has a capacity for defining holidays
[10:22:00] <hellyeah> for example range of dates şn a month is a spesific holidat
[10:22:00] <jomofcw> If I load twice the same AJAX request, is there a way to not perform it the second time and just retrieve the result of the previous request ? Kinda a cache thing ("cache:true" in AJAX option load it twice anyway).
[10:22:01] <hellyeah> y
[10:22:06] <decx> like you would disable any date
[10:22:22] <Gnjurac> just to chek $(divSelector);  is  $("#div1") or  $(#div1)?
[10:22:33] <Gnjurac> i guess its whit "
[10:22:38] <hellyeah> when user are in this month a pop up box will report user this date or this range of ddate is that holiday
[10:23:11] <hellyeah> var $divSelector = $('#div');
[10:23:20] <Gnjurac> ty
[10:23:27] <Gnjurac> i writed that just wanted to be sure
[10:23:41] <hellyeah> you can cache your selector with that way
[10:23:51] <hellyeah> and you can use it whereever you want
[10:24:09] <hellyeah> in $divSelector $ is for stating jquery variable
[10:24:14] <Gnjurac> ok ty i cahed some more stuff
[10:24:34] <hellyeah> donr re wrap jquery variable with $ like $($divSelector) this was the my mistake :)
[10:25:09] <Gnjurac> i did it like this
[10:25:10] <Gnjurac> var $cn = $("#cenovnik")
[10:25:17] <hellyeah> good
[10:25:23] <hellyeah> try to use jsfiddle
[10:25:28] <hellyeah> do you know it?
[10:25:30] <Gnjurac> ye
[10:25:40] <jomofcw> Sorry, was disconnected. I ask again so.
[10:25:43] <hellyeah> okey see what you have in jsfiddle
[10:25:43] <jomofcw> If I load twice the same AJAX request, is there a way to not perform it the second time and just retrieve the result of the previous request ? Kinda a cache thing ("cache:true" in AJAX option load it twice anyway).
[10:25:47] <Gnjurac> just waz thinking cuz small code to test my indexpage
[10:26:07] <hellyeah> decx:  do you have any suggestion about my problem
[10:26:09] <hellyeah> ?
[10:27:48] <Gnjurac> if ( $kf.is(':visible') || $cn.is(':visible') )
[10:28:01] <geri> decx: when i split into index.html (which includes the parameter dialog) and simulation.html i need to redirect to simulation using window.location.href = "" ? how can i prevent the user from directly access to simulation.html?
[10:28:06] <hellyeah> Gnjurac:
[10:28:12] <hellyeah> write those thing in jsfiddle
[10:28:13] <Gnjurac> so now in inf i just call it like var $kf no need to do $(kf)
[10:28:19] <hellyeah> poeope can help you better
[10:28:40] <Gnjurac> i know but its just 1 line
[10:28:58] <hellyeah> $kf = $('#smt');
[10:29:10] <hellyeah> you dont need to wrap variable again
[10:29:22] <hellyeah> it is practically jquery variable
[10:29:27] <Gnjurac> ye thinked that just wanted to confirm
[10:29:33] <hellyeah> you dont need to make it jquery variable again
[10:35:34] <Gnjurac> is || in js  OR?
[10:36:20] <hellyeah> || is OR
[10:41:30] <Gnjurac> then why
[10:41:31] <Gnjurac> https://jsfiddle.net/gpw25qj8/
[10:41:35] <Gnjurac> it wont coperate
[10:41:51] <hellyeah> let me check but not expert here
[10:41:54] <Gnjurac> it needs to show line if one of those 2 divs is showing
[10:42:12] <Gnjurac> its simple if with OR
[10:43:02] <hellyeah> what is problem?
[10:43:06] <arc_> they aren't showing on document ready
[10:43:13] <arc_> you have to click a button first
[10:43:46] <Gnjurac> ye i know
[10:43:53] <arc_> this code is running on document ready, so it only checks once
[10:43:55] <Gnjurac> but problem is  $pl dosent show
[10:44:02] <hellyeah> seems work
[10:44:02] <Gnjurac> oh
[10:44:13] <hellyeah> when you click it show click again it hides
[10:44:23] <Gnjurac> so i need to add $pl not in document ready
[10:44:28] <arc_> you need this if statement inside the click event listener binding
[10:44:42] <Gnjurac> i thinked  documenty redy is a bool
[10:44:59] <hellyeah> rhought*
[10:45:02] <hellyeah> thought*
[10:45:18] <Gnjurac> it is not?
[10:45:38] <Gnjurac> oh i got waht you talking about i think
[10:46:08] <Gnjurac> or not ahahhaha
[10:47:08] <hellyeah> what about this idea
[10:47:09] <Gnjurac> lol its white line i didet saw it ahhaha
[10:47:09] <hellyeah> defiine json with holidays [16:38] <hellyeah> and check the calendar if there is march in active div [16:38] <hellyeah> show dialog box and appen spesific part of json
[10:47:24] <hellyeah> append*
[10:48:17] <geri> when i split into index.html (which includes the parameter dialog) and simulation.html i need to redirect to simulation using window.location.href = "" ? how can i prevent the user from directly access to simulation.html?
[10:48:31] <geri> decx:
[10:49:02] <geri> decx: i need some additional logic like session..?
[10:49:04] <Gnjurac> nah still dosent work
[10:49:18] <geri> decx: or ajax?
[10:50:09] <Gnjurac> https://jsfiddle.net/gpw25qj8/1/
[10:50:21] <hellyeah> i guess i solved the thing
[10:50:40] <hellyeah> it is great idea i should implement it
[10:50:48] <Gnjurac> i need black line to not show if  $kf or $cn is not visible
[10:52:37] <Gnjurac> oh i know
[10:52:40] <Gnjurac> whats the isue
[10:53:20] <Gnjurac> its cuz on buton click fade out isent instant so it reads that $kf is still visible
[10:53:32] <Gnjurac> tested it with just togle to confirm
[11:30:17] <randyr> Hey all on jquery. Trying to append some html to a <div> with $('#noteList').append("<stuffhere>"); for some reason it doesnt append anything though.
[11:31:36] <randyr> anyone?
[11:42:35] <decx> it should
[11:48:00] <randyr> The div is: <div class="list-group" id="noteList"> </div>
[11:48:12] <randyr> html = "<a href=\""+index+"\" class=\"list-group-item\"><h4 class=\"list-group-item-heading\">" + value.noteTitle + "</h4><p class=\"list-group-item-text\">" + value.content + "</p></a>"
[11:48:24] <randyr> lastly, $('#noteList').append(html);
[11:51:24] <decx> jsfiddle and reproduce
[11:53:06] <robertmaxrees> is that like "netflix and chill" but for web dev?
[11:53:34] <decx> just without the sex
[11:54:36] <decx> unless you actually come in with a ready and done testcase fiddle, then you'll be mounted
[11:56:50] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[11:57:26] <hellyeah> i have a question but i dont have time
[11:57:27] <hellyeah> xD
[11:59:25] <randyr> This is pretty much the situation summed up: https://jsfiddle.net/a8c3hy33/
[11:59:47] <randyr> the actual code uses localstorage, but thats not a problem cause console.log does properly log it.
[12:00:06] <robertmaxrees> btw - if (noteList.length > 0) { can just be if (noteList.length) {
[12:03:38] <MikeD_> is there anything obviously wrong with: dateneededctrl.datepicker("setDate", (new Date()) );  ?
[12:05:05] <robertmaxrees> randyr i was late to the party, what was the question?
[12:05:37] <randyr> the $('#noteList').append(html); doesnt append anything
[12:06:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/a8c3hy33/2/
[12:06:28] <robertmaxrees> sure it does, just need to run the function.
[12:06:47] <randyr> yea thats done elsewhere
[12:06:49] <robertmaxrees> and include jquery
[12:07:14] <randyr> in the actual code that does work. Also added console.log for both value.noteTitle and html, and both also work and give correct values
[12:07:37] <robertmaxrees> errr.  you said it doesn't work, but now you're saying it does >.>
[12:07:56] <randyr> Im saying the code does run, and also reaches the .append, but it doesnt actually append anything
[12:08:15] <robertmaxrees> console log your selector and make sure it's getting the data.
[12:08:25] <robertmaxrees> also - localstorage stores things as strings iirc, so you have to parse that out.
[12:08:42] <randyr> Yea thats all done with JSON.parse
[12:08:49] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno without seeing it.
[12:09:51] <randyr> im creating it in Brackets.
[12:09:56] <randyr> Dunno if that changes anything
[12:10:10] <robertmaxrees> brackets is an editor, so that shouldn't change anythin.
[12:10:16] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it break, it's kind of hard to help you.
[12:10:34] <robertmaxrees> console log that selector and make sure you're not, like replacing it or something somewhere.
[12:11:18] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, crack open your debugger.
[12:13:38] <randyr> if i console.log($('#noteList')); i get a n.fn.init
[12:13:43] <randyr> Is that expected?
[12:14:02] <robertmaxrees> slap a .length on there.
[12:14:29] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('#noteList').length);
[12:14:43] <randyr> = 0;
[12:14:48] <robertmaxrees> there's your problem.
[12:14:53] <robertmaxrees> that element doesn't exist when that code runs.
[12:14:59] <randyr> thats odd.
[12:15:15] <randyr> wait.
[12:15:31] <randyr> im loading the script like this:
[12:15:32] <randyr>  <script src="js/custom.js"></script>         <script type="text/javascript">window.onload = loadNotes();</script>
[12:15:43] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[12:15:46] <decx> no
[12:15:47] <robertmaxrees> use a document ready instead.
[12:15:54] <randyr> kek
[12:16:01] <decx> you're also not doing a reference to the function
[12:16:03] <robertmaxrees> window.onload more like window.ON NO amirite
[12:16:06] <decx> but just execute it
[12:16:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ that too
[12:17:35] <decx> also makes more sense to have target and source as arguments so you can actually reuse functions ^^
[12:17:50] <randyr> alright. Changed to: <script src="js/custom.js"></script> and $(document).ready(function() {
[12:18:46] <randyr> yup finally worked.
[12:20:11] <randyr> It's basically for an assignment from school. details: mobile-development.org
[12:21:01] <decx> great now i have that song stuck in my head
[12:21:15] <robertmaxrees> lol they get the casing wrong for jQuery wrong twice in two different ways
[12:21:43] <robertmaxrees> "In this assignment we are going to make a mobile app using HTML5 and jQuery Mobile" wat
[12:21:59] <decx> oooooooohh mama can this really be the end
[12:22:05] <decx> to be stuck inside of mobile
[12:22:16] <randyr> Beautiful website right?
[12:22:40] <robertmaxrees> D:
[12:26:58] <MikeD_> i just spent almost an hour looking for .find( classnametofind )  should have been .find( '.' + classnametofind )   FML
[12:27:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:28:17] <MikeD_> if .findClass() was a thing, i'd be using that instead.
[12:28:23] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[12:28:28] <robertmaxrees> .find() does everything you need.
[12:28:46] <MikeD_> except tell me when I'm being forgetful
[12:28:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:57] <robertmaxrees> $() would behave the same way ;)
[12:29:12] <decx> huh
[12:29:20] <decx> forEach has a second argument
[12:29:25] <MikeD_> of course it would... but when i use .addClass or .removeClass or .hasClass i don't have to remember to put the dot.
[12:29:39] <MikeD_> i know, that dot is crucially important
[12:29:46] <MikeD_> but still
[12:29:50] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ because that's implied in the name of the method.  the DOM traversal methods tend to be relatively generic.
[12:30:02] <robertmaxrees> and accept pretty much any selector.
[12:30:06] <decx> it's just queryselector
[12:30:07] <MikeD_> yeah, so i was proposing .findClass()
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not idiomatic with the rest of the API though.
[12:30:23] <MikeD_> for the same reason .click() and .change() exist
[12:30:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:30:33] <robertmaxrees> that's inconsistent.
[12:30:38] <MikeD_> instead of .on()
[12:30:42] <robertmaxrees> then you want $() and $$() for IDs vs Classes.
[12:30:51] <decx> write a wrapper getElementsByClassName if you want it so badly ^^
[12:30:56] <decx> for*
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> heh, try not to recreate mootools here.
[12:31:33] <decx> we need to add more prototypes to basic things
[12:31:36] <robertmaxrees> NOES
[12:31:37] <MikeD_> what's a moot ool?
[12:31:42] <robertmaxrees> mootools
[12:32:00] <MikeD_> heh, i know
[12:32:31] <BillCriswell> jQuery.fn.findClass = function (className) { return this.find('.' + className) } ?
[12:32:40] <robertmaxrees> yuck yuck yuck.
[12:32:43] <MikeD_> yeah, that's the one
[12:32:47] <BillCriswell> lol
[12:32:59] <MikeD_> but i would rather complain than just go slightly off the rails
[12:33:23] <MikeD_> i assumed the "FML" was signal enough of that fact
[12:33:27] <robertmaxrees> heh not saying you can't complain, just pointing out there's a reason there's not a findClass :)
[12:34:27] <decx> hm now i wonder, if i getelementsbyclassname on a nodelist does it actually search all of them
[12:35:03] <MikeD_> it might be nice to have a debug mode switch that when it couldn't find a tag that isn't even a valid html tag, that you'd get a helpful "fix your broken code" error message.  silent fail is frustrating... but i know, don't make mistakes and you'll be less likely to have that problem.
[12:35:08] <robertmaxrees> it'll search thopse elements + all children iic.
[12:35:31] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ that's what i use .length for 99% of the time.
[12:35:52] <MikeD_> yeah, i'll get better at finding that mistake i'm sure.
[12:36:00] <robertmaxrees> all about learning.
[12:36:17] <BillCriswell> I miss `.` all time.
[12:36:53] <decx> these nodelists dont even have getElementsByClassName attached to them ^^
[12:37:30] <decx> find is such a bae
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> find is bae <3
[13:03:38] <randyr> javascript such a pain
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> nah.  JS isn't too bad.
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> the DOM APIs are pretty frustrating though.
[13:05:06] <randyr> $('#noteTitle').text(note.noteTitle);     $('#content').text(note.content);
[13:05:19] <randyr> title doesnt work, content does. Both are the correct ID's
[13:05:28] <randyr> console.log also properly displays title + content.
[13:06:12] <robertmaxrees> what does your data look like?
[13:06:35] <randyr> simple strings.
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful.
[13:06:42] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[13:06:43] <randyr> <div class="input-group">                 <span class="input-group-addon" id="basic-addon1">Title:</span>                 <input type="text" class="form-control" id="noteTitle" aria-describedby="basic-addon1">             </div>
[13:06:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:06:56] <randyr> ill jsfiddle in the meantime
[13:06:58] <robertmaxrees> fiddle, yo :)
[13:08:34] <taplar> nodeTitle is an input
[13:08:39] <taplar> val() not text()
[13:10:06] <randyr> val() indeed solved it.
[13:10:16] <randyr> Was working on fiddle, but this is quicker xd
[13:10:29] <robertmaxrees> i had no idea what you were havign an issue with heh
[13:10:45] <robertmaxrees> btw learn.jquery.com is a great resource if you haven't gone through it yet :)
[13:12:17] <randyr> thanks.
[13:18:14] <Sllollaryee> Is it possible to make a docking navbar without jquery?
[13:18:30] <taplar> sure
[13:18:32] <Sllollaryee> is it possible with just css3, because I just made one with jquery but I dont want to include jquery if it isnt needed
[13:18:40] <robertmaxrees> anything you can do with jquery you can do without jquery.
[13:18:44] <robertmaxrees> since it's just javascript.
[13:18:52] <Sllollaryee> I suppose
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:19:00] <Sllollaryee> but could it be done with css3?
[13:19:10] <robertmaxrees> what is a "docking navbar"?
[13:19:19] <Sllollaryee> http://94.212.78.239/1234/
[13:19:30] <Sllollaryee> if you scroll it clips
[13:19:41] <decx> not possible without js
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> need JS at least for that.
[13:19:51] <robertmaxrees> to set the fixed positioning.
[13:19:56] <decx> then again
[13:20:01] <decx> i've seen it done on subreddits
[13:20:07] <robertmaxrees> without JS?
[13:20:07] <decx> doing a weird double menu hack
[13:20:10] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah.
[13:20:15] <decx> right the fixed nav is under the actual header
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> do-ish able, but i wouldn't do it that way personally.
[13:20:37] <Sllollaryee> I dont like to do hacky things
[13:20:44] <robertmaxrees> then use JS for it :)
[13:20:46] <Sllollaryee> personally I dont like using anything I dont understand
[13:20:54] <decx> that's about as hacky aas you can get without writing actual code ^^
[13:21:20] <Sllollaryee> I was just wondering, when should a person use jquery and when to stick to regular js
[13:21:34] <Sllollaryee> could I justify including jquery just for this navbar?
[13:21:38] <IceTrAiN> just print the page.  that ensures static position.  :)
[13:21:41] <taplar> depends on what you need to do, browser support, etc
[13:22:38] <decx> you'd spend 20 minutes instead of 5 it takes with jq
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> and get more consistent cross-browser support.
[13:23:12] <decx> right scrollY is a mess
[13:23:16] <decx> xbrowser
[13:23:21] <robertmaxrees> the DOM APIs are a mess.
[13:24:45] <decx> just write es6 and rely on an ecosystem as fragile as climate to build shit !
[13:26:33] <robertmaxrees> srs
[13:27:25] <decx> oh your browser doesnt do that, here let me include 6mb of polyfills
[13:28:47] <decx> jquery free website ©
[13:29:09] <taplar> which 99% of people don't care about
[13:29:18] <IceTrAiN> is that the equivalent of a vegan/gluten-free website? :)
[13:29:25] <decx> which 99% already have in their cache too
[13:29:31] <taplar> heh
[13:29:48] <decx> you have been banned from ##javascript ^^
[13:29:55] <Sllollaryee> what
[13:30:11] <Sllollaryee> so I guess its okay to use jquery just for this?
[13:30:21] <Sllollaryee> since caching and cross-browser support
[13:30:45] <decx> it's ok, it's not great for one function
[13:30:53] <taplar> use a reliable cdn and be done with it
[13:31:18] <Sllollaryee> I use a cdn
[13:31:29] <IceTrAiN> if you use a popular cdn(like google), pretty much everyone is going to have jquery cached already
[13:31:36] <Sllollaryee> and I might use it for some other stuff as well
[13:32:04] <Sllollaryee> although the page I made was mainly for building the navbar itself to see how it works n stuff
[13:37:00] <robertmaxrees> tbh jquery is small enough that you don't need to worry too much.
[13:50:55] * taplar groves to the new intellij install
[14:13:35] <Sllollaryee> I do like jquery
[14:13:42] <robertmaxrees> lots of us do.
[14:13:51] <Sllollaryee> but should I go for css3 or for jquery when given the choice?
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[14:14:25] <Sllollaryee> alright
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> generally, favor css3 when you can unless browser support is a concern.
[14:21:12] <decx> progressive enhancement!
[14:21:29] <decx> just say, yeah ie you basic bitch
[14:21:37] <decx> and give it the most basic version
[14:21:38] <decx> ^^
[14:23:29] <decx> and safari too for that matter, good lord
[14:27:05] <arc_> lol shoky i thought you meant jquery load() -_-
[14:27:32] <arc_> so yes... running load() on the audio element fixed my problem, thanks
[15:29:06] <shoky> ;p
[15:38:14] <BillCriswell> Any of you come across a plugin that stores information on an element and recaches based on certain events? Seems like something common...
[15:38:45] <BillCriswell> Basically don't want to calculate the offset top and height of an element on every scroll, so if I cache all that when the document is loaded and after the document is resized that should help a lot...
[15:39:36] <BillCriswell> Thinking something like $('.chapter').cache(['outerHeight()', 'offset().top']); then get it with $('.chapter').cache('outerHeight').
[15:39:49] <BillCriswell> I could write it, but feels like a common thing.
[15:40:59] <shoky> where's the event and recaching in that?
[15:41:26] <BillCriswell> by event I just mean like a resize event of some sort.
[15:41:50] <shoky> there's nothing in that .cache call that tells it about any event..
[15:42:34] <BillCriswell> I would provide that in one way or another haha.
[15:42:43] <shoky> it's supposed to guess? ;p  anyways just store an object in .data() and change it on the event,
[15:43:07] <BillCriswell> That's how I planned to approach it, but was wondering if anyone has seen something similar.
[15:43:12] <shoky> a plugin that does this for you would hardly save you any work, if it was to remain generic
[15:43:25] <shoky> nah ;p
[15:43:45] <BillCriswell> Haha ok. Guess I'll write it.
[15:44:47] <shoky> hope you don't really intend to mess with evaluating strings ;p
[15:44:51] <shoky> like 'offset().top'
[15:45:20] <BillCriswell> Haha I do not.
[15:45:40] <shoky> i'll relax then :D
[15:46:50] <BillCriswell> How would you approach that? A list of functions I guess?
[15:46:58] <BillCriswell> array of functions*
[15:47:57] <BillCriswell> I'm overthinking that, just oign to write a one off thing.
[16:10:58] <BillCriswell> @shoky https://jsfiddle.net/crswll/wsqdtkr1/ any tips on improving that?
[16:13:16] <BillCriswell> Basides a throttle on resize.
[16:14:00] <BillCriswell> bEsides.
[16:28:09] <hexdj> is there a way to check if a radio button value hasn't been set?
[16:28:34] <robertmaxrees> check .val()
[16:28:45] <Jagst3r15> any idea why this isn't working? I am putting the id's I find into an array and trying to tie them to an onlick even for google maps
[16:28:46] <Jagst3r15> http://pastebin.com/tZhawARs
[16:28:55] <Jagst3r15> the console.log(locationIDs); works
[16:29:12] <hexdj> robertmaxrees I have 3 possible values, do I have to check if any of them are set?
[16:29:23] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 jQuery(locationIDs)[0]
[16:29:28] <robertmaxrees> why not just pass locationIDs ?
[16:29:45] <hexdj> is there a way to check if it hasn't been set?
[16:30:15] <Jagst3r15> locationIDs returns ["location-542", "location-541"]
[16:30:20] <Jagst3r15> it wont work for an onclick
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 and it wants the elements themselves, not selectors.
[16:32:15] <robertmaxrees> hexdj you'd need to see if any of them are checked.
[16:32:36] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees what do you mean?
[16:32:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/j6sL2nya/1/
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> that
[16:33:17] <hexdj> hmm ok that seems like a long ass of checking if a radio button isn't checked
[16:33:26] <robertmaxrees> "long ass of checking"?
[16:33:39] <Jagst3r15> robertmaxrees well I know the locationIDs works
[16:33:49] <Jagst3r15> but the click will expect a #
[16:33:51] <robertmaxrees> Jagst3r15 the docs make it seem like they want a DOM node.
[16:33:52] <Jagst3r15> in front
[16:33:54] <hexdj> >way<
[16:37:41] <robertmaxrees> hexdj you could use a .filter(), too.  but okay :)
[16:37:55] <robertmaxrees> err, the function version. a few different ways.
[16:38:35] <hexdj> not sure what I am looking at in your example
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> that filters all inputs that are "Checked"
[16:39:57] <hexdj> nothing in the console
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting 0 in the console.
[16:40:25] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not filtering things out.
[16:40:45] <hexdj> I am just viewing your example
[16:40:49] <hexdj> w/Firebug
[16:40:53] <robertmaxrees> it works for me duder.
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[16:42:09] <robertmaxrees> make sure you have firebug open and then hit "run".  if that doesn't work, try the ff native dev tools maybe?
[16:42:20] <robertmaxrees> either way, that returns 0.
[16:42:53] <hexdj> ah yes, I had to run the fiddle
[16:44:09] <robertmaxrees> should run on pageload fwiw.
[18:49:53] <pepeevich> Hi guys, I write plugin to customize html5 audio player. What is the best approach to affect from one player to others? For example, I want mute all players when one of them starts playing.
[18:53:13] <arc_> pepeevich can't you just assign a class to all of the players and then do $('.playerclass').pause(); $(this).play();
[18:54:19] <robertmaxrees> or save a reference to all of them somewhere.
[18:55:45] <pepeevich> arc_ This solution isn't the best, because has a problem - I can init players like $('#player1').player();, $('#player2').player();, etc. And it will be a problem to pause them all.
[18:56:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you want to initialize them fwiw.
[18:56:26] <robertmaxrees> that kind of API would imply they're effectively sandboxed from one another.
[18:56:28] <pepeevich> robertmaxrees, Good aproach, but what is good solution to save reference?
[18:56:54] <robertmaxrees> you need to change your API design so it's clearer that changes to one will effect others.
