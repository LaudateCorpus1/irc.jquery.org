[01:02:57] <BytesAndCoffee> is there any way i could improve line #74? http://pastebin.com/z9mU4QmY
[01:52:14] <vark> Hi all - my first visit here - is this the best place to ask a question about Jquery-UI (datepicker specifically)
[01:52:40] <Uhkis> probably
[01:53:58] <vark> I'll take that probably :) Is there a way (options etc) for the datepicker month/year selectors to appear on the same month layout as the "showCurrentAtPos" location?
[01:54:33] <vark> Background - I've a 3 month range in the picker, the active month is in the middle, and having the selector at the left (default) is non-intuitive when the month selected then appears in the middle of the selector
[01:55:39] <Uhkis> make a jsfiddle
[01:57:08] <vark> Not done one before but trying to do it now
[01:58:34] <vark> https://jsfiddle.net/kbu0Lsmf/
[02:00:40] <vark> Hopefully that made the example shareable. If so, note when clicking on the input that the selectors are on the left, but the current month is in the middle. When you change the selectors you are choosing the month that will appear in the middle, but the selectors then contain the month before - which is why is appears non-intuitive
[02:03:49] <Uhkis> that's probably because when switching the month, it changes the first of them
[02:04:10] <Uhkis> and the date on it is actually the left one
[02:07:06] <vark> Yup, I get that, but when you select (for example) October - it then appears in the middle as October (as per the showCurrentAtPos setting), the selector has September (because it's the month in that box) - what I'm trying to do is have the selector on the middle box (the one set by showCurrentAtPos - actually, in theory it could be the last box in some implementations) so the month you select and where it appears is consistent
[02:07:21] <vark> 10K users of this particular functionality on the site, and they find it non-intuitive :(
[02:07:59] <vark> (the habit they have is to look on the selector section month for what they want, so regularly choose the wrong month date looking at the logs)
[02:08:23] <vark> I'm thinking I'll be digging in the datepicker code :/
[02:10:53] <Uhkis> chances are it's not possible through the options
[03:20:11] <deepy> I have a RESTful service I'm going to access in a large amount (but not all) of my pages and I want it to be easy to access it. Is there anything in jQuery that's kinda like angular's services?
[03:25:57] <vark> Uhkis: Thanks for comments earlier, I've now amended the jQuery datepicker to support showSelectorAtPos functionality, just working out how to post the change back to the devs for possible inclusion
[03:26:44] <Mark__> whatâ€™s the waypoint? $('.kso-tsUp').waypoint(function() {
[03:27:13] <DexDeadly> I'd like to know if this is possible with javascript.  I have a form with multiple fields on it.  I'd actually would like to make another field and depending on the value placed in one, it would update the value in the other field.  Also I'd need to pull a value as part of the calculation.  Possible or no?
[03:27:35] <DirtyFinn> deepy, I doubt it. Since Angular is MV* framework and jQuery as-is is not. You can create a "model" though and use it as a "shortcut"
[03:29:58] <deepy> Well a service isn't strictly tied to MV* frameworks, a crude way of doing it could be an object with functions for retrieving/sending data
[03:30:14] <deepy> Which was my initial thought, but I'm wondering if there's a more jQuery way
[03:32:57] <DirtyFinn> jQuery doesn't have services but it does have .get() .post() and .getJSON() which you can use instead of regular Ajax
[03:36:27] <vark> DexDeadly : Attach an onchange event to #field1, you can get the field value with $('#field1').val(), do your calculation on it, then $('#field2').val(result);
[03:38:13] <vark> (assuming <input id='field1' onchange='docalc();'/> <input id='field2'/> - make field2 read-only if you don't want anyone putting values in directly)
[03:39:04] <vark> (or $('#field1').on('change',docalc()); or $('#field1').on('change',function () { // Do something }); in your document ready handler)
[03:41:28] <DexDeadly> so i can do it on both
[03:43:07] <DexDeadly> so on change of one field call one function and on the other field call the other but then use the output to the other id
[03:43:38] <DexDeadly> now can field1 be dynamic since there is multiple fields
[03:48:13] <vark> As long as you don't end up building a loop (so changeing 1 changes 2 that changes 1 that changes 2 ...) yes you can
[03:48:42] <vark> $('#field'+magicnumber).val() works just as well :)
[03:50:27] <vark> @Dex - noticed that you asked if this is possible with Javascript .. the comments above are using jQuery, not native Javascript .. although you can still do it in plain Javascript, natch
[03:55:21] <clevodearia> https://jsfiddle.net/5a0tsh1u/ - Alright, forgot who it was who pinged me earlier, but here is a jsfiddle recreation of what I am trying to do from yesterday
[03:55:57] <clevodearia> When I hover over one of the links, I want the content that appears in the background to be triggered to appear similarly (transform: scale(3);)
[03:56:05] <clevodearia> currently it does not
[03:58:11] <DexDeadly> vark thank you now to figure that out :)
[03:58:28] <DexDeadly> I was worried about the loop as well
[03:58:43] <clevodearia> ah, this is no longer a jquery question as I converted from using jquery to standard javascript :(
[03:58:57] <clevodearia> but otherwise my core code base is using jquery
[03:59:00] <vark> @Dex: Hang on, I'll run up a quick fiddle for you to see it in action
[04:01:43] <vark> @Dex; https://jsfiddle.net/4v7p0tns/
[04:08:17] <DexDeadly> oh beautiful
[04:08:26] <DexDeadly> I think I can see how I can implement this
[04:08:44] <DexDeadly> you wouldn't know how to get a page to go back and automatically refresh would you :) lol
[04:09:55] <vark> My stuff is all set to non-cached (apart from truely static stuff), resets fields on page load, and is often dynamic from the server side, so it just works for me when people use back :)
[04:10:30] <DexDeadly> got ya
[04:10:46] <DexDeadly> yea i was looking for the best way to do it I'm just not sure how I'll have to play more
[04:18:40] <qerwqer23> Hi there, has anybody here ever used "Bootstrap Switch" ?
[04:25:51] <Mark__> what is that?
[04:27:28] <qerwqer23> Well, it's this "checkbox" slide plugin
[04:27:42] <qerwqer23> For some reason, it's not accepting objects as a parameter
[04:27:54] <qerwqer23> Which should be possible in v3..+
[04:28:02] <qerwqer23> http://www.bootstrap-switch.org/
[04:29:39] <DirtyFinn> qerwqer23 , can you show us yuor code?
[04:29:56] <qerwqer23> Sure, oeno momento
[04:30:53] <Bilel_mk> Hello! everyone can someone help me with my script ajax i want to count the time spent by  visitor on my website  http://pastebin.com/HBZjaRJW
[04:32:16] <qerwqer23> Dirtyfinn, jsbin isbeing a little twat, this is exactly what i mean ; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24024846/bootstrap-switch-options-dont-take-effect
[04:32:47] <Mark__> hmm
[04:32:55] <Mark__> i use my own toggle switch button.
[04:33:37] <qerwqer23> Current project i'm working on uses the switch library, can't use anything native because that's "too much"
[04:33:57] <DirtyFinn> qerwqer23, can't help without your code :)
[04:35:53] <qerwqer23> Understandable, I'll just look at the shitty ass documentation lol
[04:35:55] <qerwqer23> Have a good one ;)
[04:39:01] <lemonsparrow> hi is there a way to shorten this ? myString = myString.endsWith('.srip.net') ? myString : myString + '.srip.net';
[04:41:03] <DirtyFinn> seems as short as it gets
[04:41:14] <lemonsparrow> DirtyFinn, ok
[04:54:02] <Uhkis> better question would be "how to make this more readable" ;)
[05:58:58] <clevodearia> I did it! I love jQuery!  http://nullvoid.org/jason.khanlar/  background effect now shows properly displayed hover effects too!
[06:05:01] <clevodearia> albeit, it is a bit slow :(
[06:13:33] <clevodearia> faster now
[06:21:10] <PhonicUK> this is odd, if you do $("#sel1, #sel2").is(":checked")
[06:21:21] <PhonicUK> it behaves like an OR, returning true if any of them are checked
[06:22:09] <iaj_> Hi there. Is is possible not to use jQuery('select').val = "something"  but to invoke the "true" selection of a select field?
[06:22:44] <iaj_> Eg. to have the call to jQuery('select').change invoked?
[06:28:38] <clevodearia> PhonicUK, http://api.jquery.com/is/ "and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments."
[06:29:57] <iaj_> ok got it .trigger('change') in the end does the job
[06:32:57] <PhonicUK> clevodearia, aye its correct as per the documentation, just slightly counter-intuitive
[06:33:20] <PhonicUK> instead I did $("#sel1:checked, #sel2:checked").length == 2
[06:33:25] <PhonicUK> to check for 'all'
[06:51:52] <clevodearia> re: http://nullvoid.org/jason.khanlar/ - When mousemove over page, background changes accordingly. However, leaving the cursor still, and using arrow keys to navigate the site, the background does not change (no keydown event yet), but is it possible that I could capture or calculate the updated e.pageX and e.pageY values? Perhaps I can store them in variables and for each keypress, I can detect how many pixels the page is shifted and
[06:51:52] <clevodearia> work with that?
[06:53:07] <clevodearia> How can I detect how many pixels up/down or left/right are shifted for arrow keypresses?
[06:56:33] <clevodearia> I see firefox has config value for toolkit.scrollbox.verticalScrollDistance and for horizontal also
[07:21:52] <zagaza-> hi guys, anyone had success with vimeo's froogaloop API? my videos are autoplaying when the page loads and I can't stop them for the world. I am using a piece of code to add a unique ID to each video and try to stop it but I get Uncaught TypeError: this.element.getAttribute is not a function. Here is my code http://pastebin.com/55EW2Xhb
[07:28:16] <DirtyFinn> have you tried to add pause(); to .addEvent('ready' ?
[07:28:55] <DirtyFinn> before the unload()
[07:30:59] <zagaza-> will try
[07:31:22] <zagaza-> yep still getting Uncaught TypeError: this.element.getAttribute is not a function
[07:33:04] <zagaza-> ok now I changed the code to this http://pastebin.com/FQFGp7pR and I am getting  Uncaught TypeError: player.prop is not a function
[07:33:30] <DirtyFinn> .prop can only be boolean
[07:33:47] <DirtyFinn> try .attr('id', id)
[07:33:50] <DirtyFinn> instead
[07:33:57] <zagaza-> Uncaught TypeError: player.attr is not a function
[07:35:58] <DirtyFinn> you are looping each .vid ($('.vid').each) but player is always the first one (var player = $('.vid')[0]) ?
[07:36:45] <zagaza-> I have only 1 video per class though
[07:36:49] <DirtyFinn> did you mean $('.vid').first() ?
[07:38:00] <DirtyFinn>  $('.vid')[0] gives you the very first element whose class is 'vid'?
[07:41:03] <zagaza-> hmm
[07:41:06] <zagaza-> I changed it to .first
[07:41:10] <zagaza-> now I get no console errors: http://pastebin.com/Vqp3KtAs
[07:41:21] <zagaza-> but the videos still aren't getting paused on page load, so weird
[07:43:01] <zagaza-> that .first thing doesn't seem to be targetting the videos
[07:44:00] <DirtyFinn> how about changing the froogaloop.api('pause'); to froogaloop.pause(); etc?
[07:44:08] <DirtyFinn> I'm just guessing here :)
[07:45:05] <DirtyFinn> ... http://codepen.io/bdougherty/pen/JgDfm
[07:46:45] <zagaza-> that is just for one video DirtyFinn
[07:47:07] <DirtyFinn> i know
[07:50:30] <zagaza-> so try this
[07:50:31] <zagaza-> http://codepen.io/bdougherty/pen/JgDfm
[07:50:36] <zagaza-> the video is autoplaying on page load
[07:50:43] <zagaza-> sry sec
[07:50:48] <DirtyFinn> this is what i meant http://pastebin.com/n9V1AWrH
[07:51:17] <DirtyFinn> read the comments and uncomment the one you want
[07:51:21] <DirtyFinn> or something
[07:51:28] <zagaza-> http://codepen.io/danneniko/pen/XXVEOY
[07:51:51] <zagaza-> check that out, the first video is autoplaying because I have background=0 attribute
[07:51:55] <zagaza-> that's the one I want to stop on page load
[07:54:01] <DirtyFinn> As I have tried to point out: Your problem is within the .each() function and selecting the video at hand. See, you always have set your actions to only one of the videos on a page
[07:57:45] <zagaza-> I see mate, I tried changing those
[07:57:58] <zagaza-> did you see that codepen? are you able to get the first video to not play on page loda?
[07:58:01] <zagaza-> load*
[07:58:39] <DirtyFinn> no... didn't try... needs looping... too lazy :)
[07:59:20] <lijz> hi i am getting conflicts while using both easy ui and jquery.ui
[07:59:28] <lijz> easy ui is having same method names being used in their plugin
[07:59:39] <zagaza-> needs looping?
[08:00:17] <DirtyFinn> .each() to go through each video and applying methods and stuff to each one at a time
[08:01:23] <lijz> ["draggable","droppable","resizable","pagination","tooltip","linkbutton","menu","menubutton","splitbutton","switchbutton","progressbar","tree","textbox","filebox","combo","combobox","combotree","combogrid","numberbox","validatebox","searchbox","spinner","numberspinner","timespinner","datetimespinner","calendar","datebox","datetimebox","slider","layout","panel","datagrid","propertygrid","treegrid","datalist","tabs","accordion","window",
[08:01:38] <lijz> i just need to use the combogrid
[08:01:59] <zagaza-> nvm looping, I'll just remove one video. It's still hard to get it to pause on page load http://codepen.io/danneniko/pen/XXVEOY?editors=101
[08:06:53] <DirtyFinn> lijz, would it help if you called the method using the library name ( [library_name].[method] ) like jQueryUi.combogrid?
[08:09:23] <lijz> <finn> combogrid is from easyui
[08:10:13] <DirtyFinn> easyui.combogrid then :)
[08:10:30] <DirtyFinn> haven't tried easy ui myself
[08:12:34] <jomofcw> Hello !
[08:12:48] <jomofcw> There is not translation coming with jQuery UI ?
[08:18:49] <jomofcw> On this example it call some language files : http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#localization
[08:18:54] <lijz> <finn> have you tried calling any functions from jquery.UI using the library name?
[08:19:11] <jomofcw> I can't find those files in the jQuery UI download (latest stable version - full)..
[08:20:26] <DirtyFinn> lijz, no but I make sure not to use conflicting libraries ;) I have called methods with library name in other occasions
[08:21:07] <lijz> <finn> i really dont understand why they used the same names :)
[08:21:54] <lijz> <finn> do you have any suggestions for a combogrid  other than easyui?
[08:22:45] <DirtyFinn> nope
[08:23:39] <DirtyFinn> libraries use the names they want. no one is going to keep track of names used in every library ever made. that would lead into method names like 35fg5n1fgn3xfgn31g()
[08:23:40] <jomofcw> Shall I use those which are on the branch master (official ?) on GitHub ? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n
[08:24:43] <zagaza-> ok I'll try again with some updated code. Can someone help me out? http://codepen.io/danneniko/pen/XXVEOY?editors=101   with this code only my first video gets paused and I don't know why. Can someone help me out to pause all videos?
[08:26:27] <DirtyFinn> var iframe = $('.player1')[0]; See that [0] there? That means "take the FIRST AND ONLY THE FIRST element with a class 'player1'"
[08:26:55] <lijz> yes zagaza need to remove that [0]
[08:29:03] <user44> given is a parent div with child a and b. If somechild of a contains class x and somechild of b contains class y, the background-color of b should change. how can I define shuch a selector?
[08:29:31] <DirtyFinn> is that even supposed to work with iframe? It'd have to give the methods and stuff to the page where the videos are, not to the page where iframe is
[08:29:32] <user44> #css
[08:36:30] <zagaza-> hmm
[08:36:36] <zagaza-> ok so I made the videos pause, but it's acting all weird. I am just trying to pause the videos 5 seconds after the player is ready, but they are getting instantly paused. http://codepen.io/danneniko/pen/XXVEOY?editors=101
[08:36:50] <sochi> How would this be translated into jquery? this.firstElementChild().firstChild().firstChild().nextSibling().nextSibling().nextSibling()
[08:37:57] <DirtyFinn> this.find([selector])
[08:41:23] <sochi> $(this).context.firstElementChild.firstChild.firstChild.nextSibling.nextSibling.nextSibling . How bad is it to use this?
[08:43:10] <lijz> <sochi> use nth-child(2).siblings(2)
[08:43:11] <DirtyFinn> sochi, does the element you're trying to access have id or class name?
[08:44:52] <sochi> It does, but there are multiple instances of the element i'm trying to access.
[08:45:02] <sochi> I'm trying to grab the current element,which is in a TR on click
[08:45:23] <DirtyFinn> ok
[08:45:30] <sochi> There are dynamically generated elements on top of the item, which for some reason, find()/closest() can't get trough
[08:45:48] <lijz> <sochi> put ur html in a fiddle
[09:00:16] <raskel> what's wrong with this line: jQuery(".SalesEventProduct[data-idx="+idx+"] :selected").text() ?
[09:00:28] <raskel> it returns empty, i do pass the right idx
[09:01:38] <arc_> idk, do you want text() or val()
[09:32:07] <lijz> <raskel> use jQuery('.SalesEventProduct[data-idx="+idx+"] :selected).text()
[09:32:37] <lijz> jQuery('.SalesEventProduct[data-idx="+idx+"] :selected').text()
[09:33:11] <shoky_> that's definitely not right
[09:56:37] <deosama> !help I'm really stuck on how to make a tree out of the data I have been given. Anyone want to take a crack at it? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EPoReZ
[10:20:32] <hellyeah> hey may be it is simple question can you check line 163-165 why it didnt work https://jsfiddle.net/2f8w74u2/78/
[10:21:28] <Talltree> i suppose this is a good place to ask, i am currently using jqueryui to hide and move my nav to stick after the site is scrolled past a certain point, and my solution is somewhat lagging and not mobile friendly, do you guys have an idea how to improve it? http://pastebin.com/GTQCPF1g
[10:41:51] <azbshiri> is it better to use callback's argument instead of this inside the block?
[10:43:14] <azbshiri> for example, $('body').delegate('#parse-csv', 'click', function(self) { self.target ... do something }
[10:43:49] <decx> self wouldnt be this here
[10:44:18] <decx> this is #parse-csv and self would be the event object
[10:44:46] <azbshiri> so then how about event target?
[10:44:55] <decx> what about it
[10:45:03] <decx> it's a property of the event objects
[10:45:04] <decx> -s
[10:45:23] <decx> the target isnt necessarily this either
[10:45:44] <azbshiri> so how can I omit this call inside the block?
[10:45:57] <decx> what?
[10:46:29] <azbshiri> how can I omit use of "this" inside the block?
[10:46:48] <decx> why?
[10:47:51] <azbshiri> it's just not clear
[10:50:51] <decx> i think jquery adds it somewhere in the event
[10:50:59] <decx> somethingTarget
[10:51:09] <decx> currentTarget
[11:18:38] <diverdude> Hi, i populate my select box like this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/14590910/   When the each loop is done i want to make another $.post which will then determine what entry should be selected initially. How do i do that ?
[11:23:03] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to use jquery to filter a content from a selection in a dropdown list: https://jsfiddle.net/o5gv3e6n/
[11:23:13] <StyXman> I'm trying to develop a simple RESTful API and have a web app use it. so far I have all the verbs ok, but I fail to connect the web app properly. I can call one of the verbs with this:
[11:23:17] <StyXman> curl http://192.168.0.42:5000/trips/default -d 'trip={ "name": "default", "points": [ [ 43.55277819471542, 6.934947967529298 ], [ 43.581136968065685, 6.1 ] ] }' -X POST
[11:23:28] <StyXman> but I can't reproduce the call from the web app
[11:25:47] <StyXman> in fact I'm not sure what should I pass $.ajax() to do exactly the same
[11:26:45] <StyXman> more in particular, I think that if I manage to convert a dict/map/object to json, I'm done, but I can't find a function in jQuery for this, which is frankly quite surprising
[11:34:05] <islalobo> Does :contains only check text? How can I check the contents of markup? In my case, we have a selector "availability"
[11:35:21] <decx> your availabiltiy selector isnt allowed
[11:35:31] <NoiseEee> islalobo: i dont follow
[11:36:36] <islalobo> decx: sorry,attribute
[11:36:49] <decx> attribute right
[11:38:44] <decx> islalobo: this should lead you in the right direction https://jsfiddle.net/o5gv3e6n/1/
[11:39:14] <islalobo> decx++
[12:28:28] <Nanor> Does anyone know why my ajax request is throwing TypeError: Illegal invocation - https://dpaste.de/niZF ?
[12:28:50] <duch_kazatel> what's the data coming back?
[12:29:19] <Nanor> It's not doing anything with anything that's returned
[12:29:41] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question:)
[12:30:03] <Nanor> ha, fair enough
[12:30:13] <Nanor> Well at the minute I'm just returning None from my django backend
[12:30:59] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[12:31:13] <Nanor> It's not hitting the backend
[12:31:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, probably a syntax error.
[12:32:23] <Nanor> *shakes fist*
[12:32:32] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[12:32:36] <duch_kazatel> "failure"
[12:32:39] <duch_kazatel> it's "fail"
[12:32:43] <duch_kazatel> err, "error", sorry.
[12:32:48] <Nanor> oh
[12:32:49] <DexDeadly> Hey Vark are you around? I ment to ask you last night you provided jsfiddle  https://jsfiddle.net/4v7p0tns/ but mentioned I can do $('#field'+magicnumber).val() heres my fiddle that I'm trying to do but I'm getting told num is not defined.  https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/ or anyone else
[12:32:54] <duch_kazatel> try changing that.  if it doesn't work, then it's probably somewhere else in your code.
[12:33:26] <Nanor> no dice, thanks though
[12:33:29] <duch_kazatel> also Nanor $('div#save') just do #save - div#save makes jquery find all divs and then filter them to get the one that matches.  #save goes straight to that ID.
[12:33:43] <taplar> DexDeadly: where is num defined?
[12:38:44] <DexDeadly> i guess thats the thing where would I define that
[12:38:54] <DexDeadly> i'm not sure of the corrolation
[12:39:13] <taplar> question.  do you need a number?  they're grouped together, no?
[12:40:06] <DexDeadly> yes, the generated HTML has these fields used over and over for different games
[12:43:56] <gambl0re> i have e.preventDefault() on a form submit so that when i press enter on a form it doesnt automaticlly try to submit the form but its not working
[12:44:38] <duch_kazatel> you mean the form is still submitting gambl0re?
[12:44:43] <taplar> DexDeadly: https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/1/
[12:44:50] <duch_kazatel> show us your code.
[12:45:06] <gambl0re> yea
[13:01:31] <taplar> and it died
[13:14:39] <DexDeadly> taplar I took a look at that and it works if I fill out one field, it fills the other but it isn't doing it the opposite way
[13:15:01] <taplar> watcha mean?
[13:15:21] <DexDeadly> sorry nm lol
[13:15:24] <DexDeadly> that worked
[13:15:26] <taplar> :)
[13:15:30] <DexDeadly> you the man
[13:19:22] <DexDeadly> actually maybe I should of mentioned this.  Should it be 2 different because heres the thing, when you place a value in win its a different calculation then what is done when you place in risk
[13:19:41] <taplar> so what are the differences?
[13:19:53] <taplar> is the min the max / 2?
[13:21:21] <DexDeadly> its just a different way to calculate the value. so in a general sense if I put in a value in risk multiply it and apply to win and if you fill in win divide it and fill in risk
[13:21:38] <DexDeadly> its a larger formula i need to put in but in a general sense that
[13:21:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/2/
[13:22:04] <taplar> or if it's a big formula
[13:23:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/3/
[13:24:13] <taplar> then you can have your formulas in their different functions
[13:26:53] <DexDeadly> basically I need to take the risk amount and another value and divide by /100 and then multiple lol
[13:27:43] <taplar> well, you got a starting point, :)
[13:30:00] <DexDeadly> thanks
[13:33:04] <Moeh> Hey, I do an AJAX request using jquery. The response that I get has status: 200. Still, jquery is executing the code of the "error" function, not the success. Can someone explain why?
[13:33:15] <Moeh> I thought that status: 200 would render success.
[13:34:13] <DexDeadly> question can I pull in a value to the calculation that I have set in another field
[13:34:57] <taplar> sure
[13:35:23] <taplar> Moeh: what's the request doing?
[13:35:57] <Moeh> Signing a user up
[13:35:57] <DexDeadly> part of the calculation is another field in my loop thats the moneyline, not sure if you know bets.  DO I do a var away_ml = $('#away_ml').val()
[13:35:59] <taplar> some times that can happen if you've told ajax that the response is going to be json and it's not, in which case it gets a parsing error and will do the error callback, rather than the success, even though the request was a 200
[13:36:10] <Moeh> It sends firstname, lastname, email, password to a rails backend
[13:36:30] <duch_kazatel> Moeh the response itself might be in a format jquery isn't expecting/understanding.
[13:36:33] <taplar> DexDeadly: yeah, you can do that
[13:38:42] <Moeh> duch_kazatel: Yes, you are right. Somehow my backend responded in a way that jquery doesn't like..
[13:38:49] <Moeh> Thanks for your help!
[13:39:26] <DexDeadly> this number also has that same id attached to it how would I adjust to make sure it pulls the one with the same id
[13:40:14] <taplar> you can't have multiple elements with the same id
[13:40:27] <taplar> ids must be unique to the page
[13:40:37] <taplar> it's invalid markup
[13:42:04] <DexDeadly> sorry think i phrased that wrong here is the field i need to pull within this same calculation id="away_ml<?php echo $game_data['id'];?>" so my id is different but matches the risk/win fields in terms of that game_data['id'] field
[13:42:27] <taplar> i would suggest using a data element then
[13:42:40] <DexDeadly> ahhh
[13:42:56] <taplar> so put classes on them that define the groups
[13:43:12] <taplar> and then a data element like data-record="4"
[13:43:22] <taplar> and then you can select by the class and filter on the record
[13:43:36] <DexDeadly> so data-away_ml="<?php echo $game_data['away_moneyline_line']
[13:43:43] <taplar> data-away-ml
[13:43:50] <DexDeadly> no _ got ya
[13:44:02] <taplar> might be valid, you can try
[13:44:09] <taplar> i'm just used to dashes as part of attributes
[13:44:46] <taplar> brb
[13:47:44] <taplar> yay
[13:49:35] <DexDeadly> so I used <input type="text" data-awayml="<?php echo $game_data['away_moneyline_line']; ?>" id="risk<?php echo $game_data['id'];?>" class="bet_input maxbet formSum" data-max="<?php echo $game_data['max_wager']; ?>" name="aml[]"> Risk and then in the function I used  var away_ml = $(this).data('awayml');
[13:49:35] <DexDeadly>         console.log(away_ml); but the console is saying undefined
[13:53:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/4/
[13:53:25] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/5/
[13:53:50] <taplar> 'this' isn't applicable in that function
[13:54:15] <taplar> you have to do it while the context is the changed element
[13:54:34] <DexDeadly> ahhh i see because the function doesn't kno w
[13:54:44] <DexDeadly> so then I can pass that value though to it correct
[13:54:59] <taplar> yep
[13:56:17] <DexDeadly> actually it still says undefined
[13:57:02] <taplar> look at /4
[13:57:59] <DexDeadly> i did
[13:58:38] <DexDeadly> nm
[13:58:47] <DexDeadly> you did awaymi and i was looking for awayml
[14:03:18] <DexDeadly> ok so the console log shows my correct value, now I just send to the function and use it in my calculations right
[15:04:37] <DexDeadly> Hey Taplar, if you don't mind.  https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/6/ heres updated function.  when I type in the risk field the formulas are working perfect for me, however typing in the win field, its not updating the risk field.  I even tried to just set a value but its not working.  It doesn't seem like the away_ml is sending to that function
[15:07:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/7/  you were looking up ml but it mi in the html so i changed that
[15:07:51] <taplar> other than that one of your functions is checking that the ml is < 0, but in the html in the fiddle it is zero
[15:11:38] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/8/
[15:13:51] <DexDeadly> that away_ml is a changing number
[15:17:54] <taplar> that wasn't the original purpose of that, when i brought it up
[15:18:03] <taplar> it was going to be used to relate the different elements
[15:18:09] <taplar> but ok, :)
[15:18:59] <DexDeadly> sorry my fault
[15:20:22] <DexDeadly> so what do I change
[15:21:59] <taplar> i'm not sure
[15:22:08] <taplar> so you have a risk and win field pair
[15:22:11] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[15:22:57] <DexDeadly> yes
[15:23:15] <taplar> and there was a third field, no?
[15:23:16] <DexDeadly> if I type in win i calculate the risk if I put in risk I calculate the win amount.
[15:23:37] <duch_kazatel> mind updating the fiddle to use pure html and not use any php?
[15:23:38] <DexDeadly> the third variable is the data element awayml that is needed to calculate the values.
[15:23:53] <taplar> ah!
[15:24:32] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/9/
[15:25:27] <DexDeadly> basically i need to reverse the calculation that happens
[15:25:27] <duch_kazatel> so editing one should modify the other?
[15:25:31] <DexDeadly> yes
[15:25:50] <duch_kazatel> why not use two listeners?
[15:26:08] <DexDeadly> so any key up take the value from one field run the calculation and then apply that to the other
[15:26:32] <taplar> i had combined the two listeners before it turned into two more complex calculations
[15:26:53] <DexDeadly> it was originaly until taplar suggested the combined function
[15:26:59] <duch_kazatel> why combine it?
[15:27:03] <duch_kazatel> i'm really lost haha
[15:27:06] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/1/ shows
[15:27:08] <taplar> was was only doing *2, / 2 originall, :)
[15:27:10] <DexDeadly> original 2
[15:27:25] <DexDeadly> I didn't know that it would matter :)
[15:27:26] <DexDeadly> i'm sorry
[15:27:39] <duch_kazatel> just trying to understand rationale here, that's all.
[15:29:59] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/so7ombvh/10/
[15:30:00] <duch_kazatel> so like this?
[15:32:25] <DexDeadly> shouldn't anything typed in the 2nd box always return 2000 thouhg with how the function is written?  I noticed when typing in the second box it just copies the number over
[15:32:39] <duch_kazatel> if (away_ml < 0) {
[15:33:08] <duch_kazatel> the "Second box" being reward?
[15:33:28] <DexDeadly> second box is reward box
[15:34:05] <duch_kazatel> right, soooo.....
[15:34:17] <duch_kazatel> if (away_ml < 0) {
[15:34:22] <duch_kazatel> your value is not less than 0.
[15:35:34] <duch_kazatel> unless there's something you're alluding do that i'm not seeing.
[15:35:51] <duch_kazatel> s/do/to
[15:35:51] <b-ot> Correction, <duch_kazatel> unless there's something you're alluding to that i'm not seeing.
[15:36:50] <Uhkis> silly b-ot, it was incomplete regex
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[15:37:25] <Uhkis> missing the last / :P
[15:38:03] <duch_kazatel> that's a common chat thing these days.
[15:38:37] <Uhkis> yeah, that's why i'm here to try and fix that!
[15:39:58] <duch_kazatel> wut
[15:40:04] <duch_kazatel> i mean without the last /
[15:41:38] <_TWG_> Anyone here familiar with angular?  No one is awake in the angular room.
[15:42:00] <duch_kazatel> doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[15:42:31] <_TWG_> I'm aware of that but figured someone might know something about angular.
[15:42:35] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:42:58] <_TWG_> What's so funny?
[15:43:53] <duch_kazatel> was just trying to tell you that this really isn't the right place (shrug)
[15:44:54] <_TWG_> wow, i had no clue that jquery wasn't the right place for angular.  Like I said.  Was just hoping someone that was in this channel might know angular and could answer a question.
[15:45:43] <Uhkis> well that escalated quickly
[15:46:37] <duch_kazatel> http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/14/jquery-3-0-beta-released/ i'm excited for this.
[15:46:44] <duch_kazatel> though a little bummed about compat mode.
[15:48:36] <Uhkis> lol "kebab-case" :D
[15:51:37] <duch_kazatel> right? i giggled at that one, too.
[15:53:17] <Uhkis> animation thing sounds great
[15:53:36] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  and the speedups for custom selectors are fantastic.
[16:01:15] <DexDeadly> brain fart I see
[16:05:48] <jquery327> Hi. whats wrong here :S https://jsfiddle.net/3fhr0fmd/
[16:06:27] <jquery327> when click button it get class active and so should the box get
[16:06:38] <duch_kazatel> you can't duplicate IDs.
[16:06:52] <duch_kazatel> so you can only have one #test1 and one #test2 etc.
[16:07:13] <jquery327> ok, can I duplicate class?
[16:07:18] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[16:08:48] <jquery327> hmm.. same thing? --> $(document).ready(function () {    $('.btn').click(function() {     $(this).toggleClass('active');     var class = $(this).attr('class');     console.log(id);      $("#"+class).addClass('active');   });  });
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> update the fiddle.
[16:08:59] <jquery327> oh srry.. https://jsfiddle.net/3fhr0fmd/
[16:09:23] <duch_kazatel> you see why that won't work, right?
[16:09:27] <taplar> heh
[16:09:37] <duch_kazatel> you need to find another way to tie the two together.
[16:09:49] <duch_kazatel> also, need to hit "update" on the fiddle ;)
[16:09:52] <duch_kazatel> and share out the new link.
[16:10:57] <jquery327> when I click on btn it should find all ID = test1 and add Class to them
[16:11:17] <taplar> -all id-
[16:11:20] <taplar> there can only be 1
[16:11:21] <duch_kazatel> again.
[16:11:23] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:11:31] <taplar> it's a unique identifier
[16:11:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to find another way to relate the two.
[16:12:37] <duch_kazatel> give the ids to each .box and then put that ID in the buttons.
[16:12:38] <jquery327> oh... find all Classes who has class 'test1' and add Class 'active' to them
[16:13:11] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3fhr0fmd/1/
[16:13:16] <duch_kazatel> just do this.
[16:14:03] <jquery327> oh,, thats what Im looking for =)
[16:14:07] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:14:56] <jquery327> Now I see my problem.. I had $("#"+id) .. and It should be like u did it $(id) ..without hastag
[16:14:57] <jquery327> =)
[16:15:02] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:15:06] <duch_kazatel> i changed more than that.
[16:15:37] <duch_kazatel> your issue is you were trying to use the current class to select another element, which wouldn't work because the selector didn't make sense.
[16:15:59] <jquery327> attr to data?
[16:16:06] <duch_kazatel> look at the html.
[16:16:37] <jquery327> yep it was attr to data too =)
[16:16:40] <jquery327> thx =)
[16:16:47] <duch_kazatel> right, to use the data attribute to relate them.,
[16:17:33] <jquery327> yes, I appreciate that help =)
[16:48:38] <django_> hey all
[16:48:41] <django_> why doesnt this work: https://jsfiddle.net/a9rp2qbg/
[16:50:15] <taplar> typically you serialize forms
[16:52:08] <taplar> hmm
[16:52:23] <taplar> well your input doesn't have a name
[16:53:19] <taplar> give it a name bub
[16:55:09] <DexDeadly> So I see what I did it was a brain fart.  Working good now. Though I was wondering on something.  Theres a max value that can be placed in the risk box.  When I am assigning to the maxbet box how do I run my function to check to make sure it triggers. I had the function set for keyup and change but that doesn't seem to do it
[16:57:21] <taplar> fiddle?
[17:04:16] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/14/
[17:05:20] <taplar> so i take it the issue is with line 8?
[17:07:30] <django_> sorry got d/c. for this: https://jsfiddle.net/a9rp2qbg/ how come it doesnt capture the submit text
[17:07:41] <taplar> django_: your field doesn't have a name
[17:07:42] <DexDeadly> so if I actually do type a number in there higher then the max it fires and works on my page.  The issue I'm running into is if I fill out the win box and that risk box exceeds the max its not triggering the aler
[17:07:54] <django_> taplar, which field?
[17:08:01] <taplar> your text input
[17:08:58] <django_> taplar, ok why does it need a name?
[17:09:13] <taplar> how else is it supossed to know the key that goes with the value?
[17:10:02] <django_> weird bc in this example they dont use name in the JS: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12252378/capturing-a-form-submit-with-jquery-and-submit
[17:10:30] <taplar> sure they do
[17:10:34] <taplar> both the html tags have a name
[17:10:50] <taplar> username, password, and even submit has a name
[17:10:56] <django_> taplar, how does the JS use them?
[17:11:32] <taplar> i don't know the specifics, but when it creates the object it's going to look for the name and value and do something like resultObject[name] = value
[17:12:14] <taplar> it's the default behavior of forms.  submitting a form without javascript will put the name=value pairs on the parameters
[17:13:26] <django_> gotcha
[17:30:17] <taplar> DexDeadly: something like this maybe if I understand you https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/15/
[17:31:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/so7ombvh/16/ changed it to just keyup on the last binding so the alert doesn't fire thrice

[19:03:34] <joetidee> Am I using this IRC right?
[19:05:05] <joetidee> I have an issue with this bug: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14902
[19:08:40] <joetidee> Is anyone around?
[19:13:08] <Imaginativeone> I'm here...
[19:13:12] <joetidee> anyone here!!??
[19:13:17] <joetidee> ah, hello
[19:13:47] <joetidee> First time here, so not sure hwo to look for advice - can u help?
[19:15:10] <shoky_> joetidee: just ask your question. if someone can help they will
[19:15:26] <joetidee> ok, thanks...
[19:16:10] <joetidee> Right, I discovered a very strange bug, specific to something I am working on. Details of the bug are here: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14902
[19:20:12] <joetidee> Anyone have specific aexperience using Jquery UI Sortable and trying to get nested lists to interconnect?
[19:24:46] <joetidee> 200 users here and no-one wants to help?
[19:27:25] <shoky_> joetidee: i am looking at the issue, be patient, as i said, if someone can help they will.
[19:27:46] <joetidee> okay, thanks
[19:35:57] <shoky_> joetidee: i can't say what the problem/bug is exactly, but my first thought was that it might have to do with you initializing a .sortable on a hidden element. so tried working around it by initializing .sortable only when it's visible, and it seems to maybe have fixed the issue
[19:36:15] <shoky_> joetidee: https://jsfiddle.net/353fa42p/5/
[19:37:46] <joetidee> ok, will have a look now...
[19:41:27] <shoky_> oops, you can ignore line 10 :)
[19:41:35] <joetidee> Is there an IRC command for me to direct a messahe to a specific user here?
[19:41:53] <joetidee> *message
[19:41:55] <shoky_> just write their username and it will highlight them in most clients
[19:42:06] <shoky_> and in most clients you can complete usernames by pressing tabs
[19:42:10] <shoky_> tab
[19:42:23] <shoky_> or did you mean a private message
[19:42:49] <joetidee> PM i think (?)
[19:43:08] <shoky_> /msg user message
[19:44:07] <joetidee> Any recomendation of a decent IRC client (Windows)?
[19:44:42] <shoky_> mIRC is ok
[19:45:10] <shoky_> been using it for ages
[19:45:26] <joetidee> ok, will have a look

[21:30:36] <baako> pmercado,
[21:31:50] <baako> basicallly only 1 deal tap should be active at a time. so if you go on the site deal 2 and 3 should be hidden by default
[21:32:24] <baako> when you when click on deal deal 2. it will show it and hide deal 1 and 3 samething with deal 3 which will hide deal 1 and 2.
[21:34:37] <baako> pmercado, i hope that explaning was helpful
