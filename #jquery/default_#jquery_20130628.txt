[00:00:04] <Cork> Eviltwin: ya, that one is old
[00:00:30] <Cork> Eviltwin: same with var a = [1,2,3,4,5]; a.length = 0; a === []
[00:00:40] <Eviltwin> Well that's actually more logical
[00:00:57] <Cork> Eviltwin: well so is {} + [] actually
[00:01:09] <Eviltwin> {} + [] is misleading
[00:01:28] <Eviltwin> Because {} looks like an object but is actually a block
[00:02:02] <Cork> ya
[00:02:12] <Cork> ?eval ([] + {}).length
[00:02:12] <bot-t> Cork: 15
[00:02:21] <Cork> is the same, but for a totally different reason ;)
[00:02:27] <Eviltwin> Ha ha, yeah
[00:02:50] <Eviltwin> Well
[00:02:52] <Eviltwin> ?eval [] + {}
[00:02:53] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "[object Object]"
[00:03:13] <Eviltwin> The {} + [] vs ({} + []).length really gets people though
[00:03:21] <Eviltwin> Because they assume that {} + [] and ({} + []) are the same thing
[00:03:31] <Cork> heh
[00:04:35] <Eviltwin> At one point I was playing around with dirty things you could do in JavaScript
[00:04:44] <Eviltwin> And I came up with this Array.prototype[0] = ...;
[00:05:01] <Eviltwin> ?eval Array.prototype[0] = true; [][0]
[00:05:02] <bot-t> Eviltwin: true
[00:05:34] <Eviltwin> I was tempted to drop that in a codebase somewhere to see how screwed over people get
[00:05:43] <Eviltwin> When they use the while (arr[i]) { ... } sort of loop
[00:06:49] <k_sze[work]> Sanity check: does event bubbling mean that event handlers bound closer to the triggering element will be fired first?
[00:07:04] <Cork> yes
[00:07:22] <lakridserne> I'd appreciate if someone who know jQuery and WordPress would help me check if what I'm doing is completely wrong
[00:07:55] <Cork> the event bubbles up the tree until it hits the document and then it fires the default action unless preventDefault() has been run
[00:07:58] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: If by closer you mean further down the DOM triggers first and the document element triggers last then yes
[00:08:11] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: Event capturing happens in the opposite order and before bubbling happens
[00:08:14] <Eviltwin> But it not supported by jQuery
[00:08:58] <Cork> Eviltwin: cause it's not supported in all browsers jquery need to support
[00:09:09] <k_sze[work]> Event capturing starts with the document, yes?
[00:09:28] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: Yes and is not supported by all browsers
[00:09:56] <k_sze[work]> I see. Now I just need to figure out how Backbone.js' view events are bound.
[00:10:03] <Eviltwin> For <html><body><div><span>x</span></div></body></html>
[00:10:19] <Eviltwin> It would capture html, then body, then div, then span, then bubble span then div then body then html
[00:10:27] <Eviltwin> In W3C-compliant browsers
[00:10:39] <k_sze[work]> I need to have some guarantee about the order of event handlers when I mix jQuery and Backbone.js. :/
[00:10:44] <lakridserne> I'm trying to implement http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text into http://www.dicud.com/photo/what-songs-are-you-listening-to-this-summer/
[00:11:03] <lakridserne> I've added the following to my functions.php in my theme: http://pastebin.com/BT4gK10A
[00:11:16] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: I'd be surprised if Backbone used capturing
[00:11:24] <lakridserne> And this just before </body> http://pastebin.com/HSKcHm1q
[00:11:44] <lakridserne> And modified my single.php to have this: http://pastebin.com/KeT4VC6t
[00:12:10] <lakridserne> Are there anything obvious that does it does not collapse and make it expandable
[00:12:27] <k_sze[work]> Eviltwin: I doubt it, too. But I want to make sure that my $(document).on(...) handlers are fired last, after the Backbone ones.
[00:12:29] <Eviltwin> lakridserne: Did you include "The jQuery"?
[00:12:51] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: Well if the Backbone ones are bound first and are actually bound to the elements, you're fine
[00:13:06] <Eviltwin> k_sze[work]: jQuery's will only happen bubble side
[00:13:50] <lakridserne> Eviltwin: In functions.php I added that action because WordPress Codex says that it will add the jQuery and if I add it manually I'm possibly making a double jQuery or something so it wouldn't work
[00:14:28] <Eviltwin> lakridserne: No, I mean there's a section here called "The jQuery": http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text
[00:14:34] <Eviltwin> lakridserne: And all of that code needs to make it in the page.
[00:15:09] <lakridserne> Ah yes, that's here: http://pastebin.com/HSKcHm1q
[00:15:36] <k_sze[work]> Eviltwin: if I read the Backbone source code correctly, the events are bound on the $el of each view, so I guess they are guaranteed to be fired before my $(document).on(...).
[00:15:44] <lakridserne> I modified it slightly (changed $ to jQuery) because WordPress Codex said that the $ shortcut isn't available
[00:17:42] <k_sze[work]> Eviltwin: hold on. What about the Backbone ones being "bound first"?
[00:17:51] <k_sze[work]> Why would that matter?
[00:18:29] <k_sze[work]> That's only *if* Backbone also binds on the document instead of more specific elements, right?
[00:22:22] <lakridserne> "The jQuery" was added just above </body> if that makes any difference
[00:31:34] <mazzachre> I have tried this if($('.myClass input').val()) {} to run something based on a value being present in the input elements under myClass, which works fine for text input elements, but not for radio or checkbox input elements, how do I best check if there is a value set in any input element or a checked value in a radio or checkbox?
[00:32:55] <sammichToo> checkboxes are .prop('checked')
[00:32:58] <sammichToo> mazzachre:
[00:33:08] <mazzachre> If I do if($('input', '.myClass').val()) {} Then it will always run for radio and checkbox elements, wether something have been checked or not...
[00:33:51] <mazzachre> sammichToo: Ya, but then I miss out on input type text elements with values...
[00:34:42] <lakridserne> Eviltwin: If you'd take a look once you get back I'd appreciate it
[00:37:47] <sammichToo> well yeah, that's the thing
[00:38:01] <sammichToo> is it wrapped in <form></form>?
[00:38:07] <mazzachre> It is in a form ya
[00:38:13] <sammichToo> then you can just call serialiseArray on it
[00:38:32] <sammichToo> I think, though ti's not something I've used with checkboxes/radio
[00:39:04] <mazzachre> Well, not really, because I want only some of the elements, based on what class is put on the <li> elements they are contained in...
[00:39:33] <sammichToo> well, you're gonna have to probably do a more complex check
[00:40:22] <sammichToo> $(selector input).each(function() { switch($(this).attr('type')) { cases } });
[00:42:03] <mazzachre> sammichToo: Ya, but that just seems excessive, all I want to do it check is some value present in any of these, then do something... Looping through everything to find out, seems... obsesive somehow :(
[00:45:56] <lakridserne> If somebody want a probably easy job, I'm willing to pay someone for helping me getting this to work http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text on http://www.dicud.com/photo/what-songs-are-you-listening-to-this-summer/
[00:51:47] <sammichToo> mazzachre: okay, first of all, that line doesn't even work on multiple elements
[00:52:08] <sammichToo> .val() on multiple elements only gives you the first element's value
[00:52:16] <sammichToo> so you're SOL already ;)
[00:52:24] <sammichToo> in using that particular line
[00:53:16] <sammichToo> use serializeArray(), make sure your forms are sectioned how you need them, make sure all your inputs have values so that they show up as something if they're selected
[00:53:26] <sammichToo> that's probably as close to what you want as I can think of
[01:15:53] <mazzachre> Hmmm... Can this be done more elegantly? if($('input[type="radio"]:checked,input[type="checkbox"]:checked', this).val() || $(':input', this).not('[type="checkbox"],[type="radio"]').val()) {}

[01:43:29] <titii> I have a poup menu that is absolute positioned to its parent (li - is relative) with right:0 position, and i would make it respoble, so when i resize window to some minimum, the menu will be clipped in left side, how to solve it?
[01:44:26] <Cork> titii: bind $(window).resize()
[01:45:13] <titii> Cork: yes, with window resize event
[01:45:52] <Cork> what i meant is you would have to do the actions to the li's you want when the resize event triggers and the window sizes change
[01:46:12] <Cork> titii: alternatively you could try using @media queries
[01:46:50] <titii> Cork: yes, i know it, but maybe i would like to see some example or something
[01:47:15] <Cork> hard to give example for a generic question like that
[01:48:15] <titii> Cork: i was playing with it already, offset.left... but i was fail, so i would like to see some tips
[01:49:04] <Cork> create a working example of your problem

[01:57:35] <gavrochel> hello. I want to show a message on a form submit event. I can't get it to work. Help please
[01:57:49] <gavrochel> http://jsfiddle.net/gavroche/V6uZf/4/

[02:03:38] <lakridserne> http://www.dicud.com/photo/what-songs-are-you-listening-to-this-summer/ - anyone who know why the text isn't collapsed as it should? - I have tried implementing http://shakenandstirredweb.com/240/jquery-moreless-text
[02:05:44] <Cork> lakridserne: your page is broken just so you know it
[02:06:07] <Cork> you have a question mark before your doctype and that's not allowed for a standard complient page
[02:07:11] <Cork> also... 4.01 why such an old doctype?
[02:07:21] <lakridserne> Cork: thanks
[02:07:30] <lakridserne> Cork: Should be fixed now
[02:07:32] <k_sze[work]> What does jQuery 1.8.x do about events that cannot be delegated?
[02:07:36] <lakridserne> Cork: Not me who made the theme
[02:08:00] <k_sze[work]> e.g. $(document).on('change', 'select', function() {...}) //!!!
[02:08:24] <Cork> k_sze[work]: those can be delegated
[02:08:42] <k_sze[work]> Cork: apparently not in IE?
[02:08:52] <Cork> lakridserne: change it to <!doctype html>
[02:09:21] <k_sze[work]> Cork: or 'focus' and 'blur',
[02:09:23] <Cork> lakridserne: also where is the script for collapsing?
[02:09:41] <lakridserne> just after <body>
[02:09:51] <Cork> k_sze[work]: jquery has shim code to use focusin/focusout for the browsers that support it
[02:10:02] <Cork> and special code for browsers that doesn't
[02:10:51] <Cork> lakridserne: after?
[02:11:16] <Cork> ah...
[02:11:20] <Cork> a plugin
[02:11:26] <Cork> minimized...
[02:11:28] <lakridserne> Cork: Should it be in head?
[02:11:28] <k_sze[work]> I see. So I can safely assume that something like $(document).on('focus', 'a', ...) will just work, right?
[02:12:06] <k_sze[work]> maybe not 'focus', 'a', but 'focus', 'input[type="text"]'
[02:12:13] <lakridserne> It's this code BTW: http://pastebin.com/HSKcHm1q
[02:12:24] <Cork> k_sze[work]: yes
[02:13:02] <k_sze[work]> Cork: even for elements that are only inserted dynamically after this handler is bound?
[02:13:41] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L534
[02:13:42] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L704
[02:13:46] <Cork> k_sze[work]: yes
[02:14:13] <Cork> k_sze[work]: as long as the element is inserted through jquery
[02:14:36] <k_sze[work]> ah, I knew there would be a catch. :P
[02:15:07] <Cork> lakridserne: you have javascript errors in the page
[02:15:10] <k_sze[work]> But thanks for the clarification. :D
[02:15:16] <Cork> lakridserne: and it prevents it from executing
[02:15:32] <lakridserne> Cork: How can I debug those?
[02:15:46] <Cork> k_sze[work]: well it will just work for browsers that supports focusin, but for the other ones jquery needs to emulate
[02:16:03] <Cork> lakridserne: check your error console
[02:16:13] <Eviltwin> lakridserne: http://fixingthesejquery.com
[02:16:40] <Cork> lakridserne: also run the page through w3c validator when you're at it
[02:16:55] <lakridserne> Thanks
[02:17:52] <Cork> man that max-height: auto; doesn't work for transision is so freaking frustrating...
[02:20:47] <lakridserne> Cork: Thanks a ton - It seems I've got further now

[02:33:28] <mazzachre> I have a form that is submitted by someone pressing enter in a field, then obviously the first submit or button is activated, but that is a cancel action and the users want to be asked if it is OK to cancel or not... How can I check what kind of button name/value will be sent over?
[02:42:28] <Cork> mazzachre: make the cancel button not a submit button and it should just work
[02:42:56] <Cork> <button type="button">Cancel</button>
[03:15:51] <otiuk> what is the best way to validate certain form elements .. i was going to give each element that needs to be required the "required" class but then i am not sure how that would work with radio buttons.. what is the best way?
[03:18:44] <hazamonzo> hey folks. I need to develop a DnD ui generator (similar to layoutit, jetstrap or divshot). Im familiar with the basics of the jquery drag and drop functions but im looking to avoid writing this from scratch. Does anybody know of a good starting point / framework for developing a DnD layout editor? Open Source
[03:20:54] <initself> i have a select box selector for change
[03:22:01] <initself> it opens on the page with a default value
[03:22:15] <initself> is it possible to create a selector that works when you click on the default value rather than changing it?
[03:30:05] <icjs> hi, so i'm working with a a checkbox group that i cannot change the source to. one of the checkboxes is "ALL". i want to use jquery (fixed to v1.4.2) to ensure that "ALL" is checked if none of the others are checked.
[03:30:37] <icjs> and to uncheck if any of the others are checked
[03:30:54] <icjs> i have a jsfiddle set-up which i'm poking
[03:40:08] <Konda> If i want to program my own slideshow without plugins, is jquery the language to use?
[03:41:03] <Cork> Konda: it depends more on where you want to use it then in what language to write it
[03:41:14] <Cork> +in
[03:41:49] <Konda> well Id like to use it in the body sextion on my webpage, to show different items
[03:42:02] <Konda> section*
[03:43:14] <ashitvora> jQuery is not a language. And yes, it will make your task alot easier.
[03:43:48] <Cork> Konda: most of it can be written in css, with jquery for fallback
[03:45:53] <Konda> I'd like to have a "next" button that imports a new picture when clicked, is there a java or jquery script for that?
[03:46:12] <Cork> Konda: either
[03:46:27] <Cork> Konda: jquery is a framework to help you write javascript
[03:46:37] <Cork> Konda: it can't do anything you can't do in javascript
[03:47:09] <Konda> ah okey, but the easiest way is to use jquery and not only javascript?
[03:47:18] <Cork> normally yes
[03:47:44] <Konda> alright, im gonna read up on it abit ;) thanks
[03:48:55] <initself> how can i get this to work so that if i click on the already selected value, it alerts? http://jsfiddle.net/55cjz/2/
[03:51:18] <Cork> initself: you could bind keyup and click
[03:51:32] <Cork> though those will be a bit spammy, so you need to handle that
[03:53:10] <initself> binding click to that exact selector pops right when you touch the select box at all
[03:53:22] <initself> is that what you mean by spammy?
[03:53:35] <Cork> it will trigger on each click on the select element yes
[03:53:59] <initself> i might need to add an option for the user like:
[03:54:15] <initself> Use current user: <click here>
[03:54:15] <initself> OR
[03:54:25] <initself> Select a user from the menu: <select>
[03:54:36] <Cork> why do you need to know if they don't change the value?
[03:55:11] <initself> I thought, if the select matches the current user id, default to that.
[03:55:23] <initself> Then, if they want to use that selected value, they can just click it.
[03:55:33] <initself> If they change the value, it'll pop some other user that they don't intend to pop.
[03:55:49] <initself> When what they really want is to pop the already selected user.
[03:56:05] <initself> so maybe i need two UI items instead of the one select box
[03:56:26] <Cork> or just have the correct use in the pop
[03:56:31] <Cork> *user
[03:56:40] <Cork> and only change it when the change event triggers
[03:56:51] <initself> the correct user is the one currently selected
[03:57:00] <initself> it doesn't pop just because it is selected
[03:57:09] <initself> the user has to say: i want to click that
[03:57:21] <Cork> i don't really follow
[03:57:35] <initself> in the fiddle, it defaults to Anthony Sinopoli
[03:57:38] <initself> he is the current user
[03:57:59] <initself> to trigger the alert, i have to change to another user and then change back to him
[03:58:24] <initself> i need some way for the user to click him straightaway
[03:58:27] <initself> so what i'm saying is
[03:58:39] <Cork> why do you need to use an alert to start with?
[03:58:40] <initself> combining all that into a select box is probably ugly
[03:58:48] <initself> Cork: the alert is just a test mechanism
[03:58:56] <initself> in reality, it pops a new window based on the url
[03:59:18] <initself> i can just creat the two part UI as explained above
[03:59:27] <initself> it's probably the only way just because of the way select boxes work
[03:59:30] <Cork> so have the selectbox do a <option value="">Please select ...</option>
[03:59:41] <initself> right, but then it's not selecting that current user
[03:59:48] <initself> most always, they want to use the current user
[03:59:52] <Cork> show the current user as the fist in the list
[04:00:02] <initself> you mean to say...
[04:00:12] <initself> use Pleass select, but add the current user to the top of the list?
[04:00:20] <Cork> but yes, what you want is a menu not a select box
[04:00:26] <initself> oh
[04:00:29] <initself> what's a menu?  ahhaha
[04:00:38] <Cork> ?g jquery ui menu

[04:00:41] <bot-t> Cork, Menu | jQuery UI - http://jqueryui.com/menu/
[04:01:27] <initself> but this list has in practice like 80 items
[04:01:36] <initself> i only used 4 in my fiddle
[04:01:43] <gry> Cork: how do I make this one alert me after user filled in the 3 fields? http://jsfiddle.net/gryllida/TTsHk/
[04:01:44] <Cork> so?
[04:01:52] <initself> so you need the slider of the select box, right?
[04:02:00] <initself> maybe i should read the API for a menu
[04:02:00] <Cork> the menu can handle that just as well as a select dropdown can
[04:02:17] <initself> let me just give it a shot

[04:10:59] <Cork> reloadz: append it to the end of the parent
[04:11:27] <reloadz> yea... but how can I "copy" it?
[04:12:20] <reloadz> more likely -> CUT first -> PASTE as last.....
[04:12:58] <Croves> Hello guys! I'm having some troubles here with bootstrap. I'm using Togglable tabs to create a menu, but I need to call a AJAX function when the user click in one tab. My problem is I can't trigger the event 'click' in the tabs.
[04:13:07] <Croves> This is how my HTML looks: http://pastebin.com/YRmJwMRY

[04:17:17] <Cork> reloadz: var cache = $().detach(); ................... $(list).append(cache);
[04:17:57] <initself> Cork: i've got my menu now, but i am not seeing a resize thing in the API
[04:18:14] <Cork> initself: just set a max-height in the css
[04:18:37] <Cork> and if that breaks set a overflow:auto
[04:20:42] <seutje_> Croves: bootstrap has show and shown events it emits on the tabs
[04:21:55] <initself> Cork: neat man, this is coming along
[04:21:57] <initself> Cork++
[04:26:24] <initself> Cork: where are these CSS options for menu documented?
[04:26:33] <initself> ie. how the hell did you know you could do that?
[04:26:37] <Cork> initself: csswg?
[04:26:50] <Cork> initself: it's just plain dom elements
[04:26:54] <initself> oh god, i'm sorry
[04:26:58] <initself> idiot!
[04:27:08] <initself> it's just a list!
[04:27:12] <Cork> :)
[04:27:18] <initself> hahah
[04:27:29] <initself> it's 4:27 AM, i'm on the upside of that
[04:28:38] <initself> i'm gonna throw another question into channel, but i've asked this question many many times
[04:28:44] <initself> and no one ever bites
[04:29:06] <initself> I am using jQueryUI tabs, so to get the tabs going, it has anchors like this:
[04:29:17] <initself> http://reports.candelacorp.com/dd/contact_stats/?cust_num=001800&cont_num=002#tracking
[04:30:01] <initself> how can i get those tabs, when clicked, to trigger a change to the url bar?
[04:30:18] <initself> it would do so only cosmetically, you know what i mean?
[04:30:20] <Cork> ?g mdn modify history
[04:30:20] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[04:30:21] <seutje_> don't they do that by default?
[04:30:23] <bot-t1> Cork, Manipulating the browser history - Web developer guide | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[04:30:31] <initself> seutje_: you would think!
[04:30:48] <seutje_> guess it preventDefaults
[04:30:52] <initself> is there a way to get them to do it by default?  maybe that's something that needs to be created in jQueryUI
[04:31:07] <Cork> ya, the tabs plugin runs preventDefault
[04:31:15] <Cork> cause else the page would scroll by default
[04:31:31] <Cork> a bit sad that it doesn't have an option to turn that off
[04:31:45] <initself> right, the page would scroll
[04:31:54] <Croves> seutje_ The problem is, when I try to use these events, nothing happen
[04:31:58] <initself> so my recourse is to alter the .history?
[04:32:01] <Cork> the user the pushState from that link
[04:32:12] <initself> push to the url stack of the history?
[04:32:16] <Cork> initself: yes
[04:32:19] <Cork> read the link
[04:32:23] <Croves> I'm trying this: $('#myTab a[data-toggle="#tab"]').on('show', function() { alert('a'); });
[04:32:27] <initself> i see the pushState() method now
[04:32:40] <initself> In a sense, calling pushState() is similar to setting window.location = "#foo", in that both will also create and activate another history entry associated with the current document. But pushState() has a few advantages:
[04:32:44] <initself> exactly!
[04:32:49] <initself> hells ya, let me implement this
[04:33:09] <initself> (but first i have to get my menu working in 30 minutes in production before start of business
[04:33:12] <initself> )
[04:33:55] <initself> dammit
[04:34:10] <initself> Cork: isn't thsi menu thing supposed to trigger the href when i click it?
[04:34:17] <initself> or do i need to implement a click selector?
[04:35:01] <initself> hovering over the list, i get urls
[04:35:12] <initself> but clicking them does a nothin a mario!
[04:35:37] <Cork> you would have to have click handlers yes
[04:35:46] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/menu/#event-select
[04:36:53] <initself> got it
[04:37:28] <Cork> window.location = ui.item.context.href; should work
[04:45:44] <initself> this appears to be working in the fiddle
[04:45:45] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/55cjz/6/
[04:45:49] <initself> but not on my server
[04:45:58] <initself> Firebug doesn't report any errors
[04:47:40] <initself> i must need this: ui.item.context.href
[04:48:47] <initself> i'm not getting anythign in console.log
[04:49:01] <initself> seems like the selector is working!
[04:49:12] <initself> as the menu is getting created!
[04:50:46] <seutje_> Cronoh: does $('#myTab a[data-toggle="#tab"]') exist when it's being evaluated?
[04:55:22] <initself> thank god for StackOverflow, I would have been stuck on that for a while
[04:55:32] <initself> i am on an older jquery, so selected: function( event, ui ) {
[04:57:57] <initself> Cork++ # thanks yo!
[04:58:21] <cusco> hey folks
[04:58:32] <cusco> I'm having erratic behaviour in ui .tabs()
[04:58:41] <cusco> I am not being able to figure why
[04:58:55] <cusco> tried pasting on jsfiddle but din't workout... here is the page http://ovh.tretas.eu/~cusco/test/test/x.htm
[04:59:43] <Saaether> cusco whats the problem?
[05:00:53] <cusco> Saaether: click on agent 1 /2 and move tabs between first and second/third
[05:01:08] <cusco> the div showing will be weird and not show the tab1 div...
[05:01:10] <cusco> bellow
[05:02:05] <gry> Cork: with http://jsfiddle.net/TTsHk/2/ - thanks, that's excellent, is there a way to also have that function fire when user started typing first symbol in the last input field? otherwise he stops when he entered the data, but the alert doesn't fire before he removes focus from the last input field :)
[05:05:17] <initself> hrm, why doesn't tabs have a trigger on click of the tab?
[05:05:19] <initself> can't find it
[05:05:29] <initself> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/
[05:05:50] <initself> activate, maybe
[05:06:02] <initself> ya, that's gotta be it
[05:09:38] <initself> select, old api again!
[05:12:43] <cusco> initself: active
[05:12:58] <initself> cusco: well, select is working?
[05:13:23] <cusco> sorry I mean 'activate'
[05:13:27] <cusco> is the event you're looking for
[05:13:40] <initself> ya, but activate doesn't work with older jQueries
[05:13:42] <cusco> also: beforeActivate, beforeLoad
[05:13:45] <cusco> ah
[05:13:57] <cusco> wich one are you using..?
[05:13:59] <initself> ya, i just learned about how different the APIs are twice tonight
[05:14:02] <initself> ithink i'm on 1.8
[05:14:09] <cusco> can't you check?
[05:14:11] <initself> there's something keeping us from upgrading, not entirely sure what
[05:14:38] <initself> wow 1.7.1 and 1.8.11
[05:14:44] <initself> old school

[06:10:52] <hans_henrik> is jQuery 1.x still supported? maintained?
[06:11:52] <hans_henrik> and i guess, "we dropped IE 6/7/8 compat for performance, and ease of further development"?
[06:11:53] <sammich> 1.9 has support for IE8 and below
[06:12:03] <hans_henrik> in 2.0
[06:18:31] <daum> has anyone used the jquery dataTables plugin with nested tables?
[06:22:45] <audiotek> hey guys, how can I find the DOM ID of a jquery object
[06:23:25] <hans_henrik> audiotek, i guess [0].id or [0].getAttribute("id")
[06:23:46] <hans_henrik> i don't really know though
[06:24:24] <audiotek> i have a selector which select the first part of an id and puts it in a var
[06:24:32] <audiotek> I want do a switch case afterward
[06:25:52] <hans_henrik> switch($var.val){case "what": break; case "ever": break; default: "error?";break;}
[06:27:17] <sammich> $el.attr('id')
[06:27:39] <audiotek> yeah attr id
[06:27:41] <audiotek> should do it
[06:27:41] <sammich> for the first part, you'll have to do a split or
[06:27:42] <audiotek> thanks
[06:32:50] <audiotek> no need to split it
[06:32:58] <audiotek> if($ajaxResponse.attr('id') === 'UpdateResponseQA')
[06:32:59] <audiotek> 			$('input:text:visible:first').focus();
[06:33:14] <audiotek> works
[06:33:15] <audiotek> :-)
[06:33:35] <sammich> that's alright then, you did say 'first part of id' though ;)
[06:35:17] <audiotek> 	$ajaxResponse = $('span[id^="UpdateResponse"]');
[06:35:17] <audiotek> this
[06:35:24] <audiotek> selects the first part
[06:42:48] <darkfrog> is there no way to insert at index with jQuery?
[06:45:02] <marvelous> what?
[06:45:04] <sammich> I wonder if you can do it with .find(':nth-child').after()
[07:03:45] <chrisan> where would be a good place to ask about jasmine-jquery?
[07:04:17] <hans_henrik> i guess this place
[07:04:26] <hans_henrik> just ask! :p
[07:05:18] <anli> How do I get the current tab in a .select handler? (jquery tabs)
[07:05:22] <anli> the index
[07:06:10] <anli> Ah, putting debugger; there gave me ui.index
[07:08:10] <darkfrog> I'm attempting to create an undo / redo feature to delete an element from the page, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to insert the item back at the same index it was deleted from.
[07:08:14] <chrisan> so I'm trying to test if an element exists on a view with toExist() and it claims it doesnt: https://gist.github.com/chrisan/bddc374fff535c8c6f73
[07:09:02] <darkfrog> if I could just use index it would be fairly trivial, but it becomes more complicated having to see if there is a sibling before based on index....is there a simple way to accomplish this?
[07:14:32] <sammich> history.push({el.html(), index})
[07:17:01] <Bloomberg> Hello guys!!
[07:17:57] <Bloomberg> guys how can I get the click of an alert?
[07:18:08] <sammich> you don't
[07:18:21] <Bloomberg> for  example when I click the accept button of alert reload the page
[07:18:43] <sammich> var response = confirm('this is a question')
[07:23:00] <amaroks> Hey Guys, is this a true json?http://bpaste.net/show/XO2qqjOWzvITsDKpZ5qY/
[07:23:20] <sammich> no
[07:23:32] <sammich> throw it in jsonlint
[07:24:11] <sammich> it's valid JS struct, but not JSON
[07:24:29] <sammich> JSON needs string:value pairs
[07:24:35] <sammich> as i understand it
[07:24:47] <Kae> hi guys, anybody knows if it's possible to use JSONP ajax calls and make the content SEO friendly?
[07:32:02] <BillCriswell> Kae: If you're putting the content on the page from the request there's no reason a crawler now-a-days should have a problem reading it.
[07:35:13] <Croves> Any idea why my return is going to error(), and not to success()? http://pastebin.com/hmG1Nipw
[07:35:25] <Kae> BillCriswell: then why so much troubles about ajax and seo? I found resources about hashbang and pushtate to make ajax request SEO friendly... I'm confused :S
[07:36:04] <Croves> Firebug return this: POST http://localhost/atendimento-online/index.php/atendimentos/buscar_chat 200 OK 41ms
[07:36:15] <Croves> I mean, 200 OK. It should go to success(), right?!
[07:37:15] <BillCriswell> Kae: I could be wrong.
[07:38:10] <BillCriswell> Trying to research anything SEO related just makes me want to punch babies. So I won't.
[07:38:37] <Kae> BillCriswell: lol I don't ike it either but I have to ...
[07:40:54] <BillCriswell> Kae: The idea of making a website as good for a machine as possible seems against the whole goal of the internet for me.
[07:42:50] <Kae> BillCriswell: yes, but the purpose is to take advantage of search indexing by following those SEO optimizations
[07:43:52] <mikecmpbll> If google was compiled by librarians browsing the internet all day then I'd agree with you BillCriswell, but it aint ;).
[07:44:11] <BillCriswell> Oh I'm aware. Using Google to search for ways to beat Google..
[07:45:27] <BillCriswell> Kae, mikecmpbll: It may just be the old ways I'm against: terrible urls, meta keywords, stuffed <h1>s, stuffed bread crumb navigation... The shady stuff.
[07:45:39] <Kae> mikecmpbll: BillCriswell: if you can't find it on google it doesn't exist :)
[07:45:57] <mikecmpbll> ah, well no one can argue with you on that.
[07:46:22] <BillCriswell> I still like the idea of just making a site as good for a human as possible. I think the rest will fall into place if you do a good enough job with that.
[07:46:45] <mikecmpbll> it should absolutely never negatively impact the human-readability of the page
[07:47:24] <mikecmpbll> and good computer-readability usually means concise and self-documenting code, so better for devs too.
[07:47:25] <Kae> BillCriswell: mikecmpbll: those seo optimizations never impact the end user is just for the google spiders
[07:48:19] <BillCriswell> Kae: A stuffed <h1> tag will make me assume the rest of the content is bullshit, and it usually is.
[07:49:49] <BillCriswell> I hate to think of all the wasted man hours on pages of text that not a single person will ever read.
[07:50:20] <Kae> BillCriswell: yes but the end user won't care about that unless it takes hours to load your page
[07:50:37] <mikecmpbll> those techniques are redundant in modern seo anyway.
[07:51:02] <BillCriswell> Kae: I firmly believe all that pollution really makes it hard to focus on what's important  on a page.
[07:51:37] <mikecmpbll> Kae: regarding your original point, google can't trawl single-page apps like vanilla backbone.js apps IIRC.
[07:51:49] <mikecmpbll> but i'm no expert.
[07:53:18] <BillCriswell> If something is short, people are more likely to read it. If it's clear and to the point it's perfect. Brevity is a beautiful thing.
[07:53:22] <Kae> BillCriswell: I believe SEO is ok in some degree, but people focus too hard on that, positioning is like rating on the tv
[07:54:12] <Kae> mikecmpbll: yes that's true, there are some frameworks not supporting SEO, however if you have read about pushstate that sounds promising
[07:54:18] <Kae> and easy to implement
[07:54:55] <Kae> but in my case we will use JSONP ajax calls not just ajax calls which in my opinion doesn't work with pushstate, not sure tough
[07:57:51] <fppp> How can I contruct a position object manually? I'm trying to use autocomplete, but jQuery can't figure out the position because I'm using web components and it looks like jquery position doesn't work with shadow dom, but I can still find the position with getBoundingClientRect(), so I would like to get that position into autocomplete somehow..
[08:40:00] <Fischkopf> how do i decide if i should use jQuery UI or jQuery Mobile? My application might need mobile support in future, but its not quasi safe, that this will be the case. So is there an adavntage in using jQueryUI?
[08:43:18] <mbrzuzy> Hi guys, I'm writing a jQuery plugin and I'm having issues with binding to the window scroll event inside the plugin
[08:43:28] <mbrzuzy> what is the technique to call a function on scroll within a plugin?
[08:50:14] <shoky> mbrzuzy: same technique as outside a plugin. $(window).scroll(function() { ... })
[08:51:30] <mbrzuzy> shoky, yea that I know, what I'm trying to do is call a function from my plugin on scroll
[08:51:56] <mbrzuzy> I have a prototype setup for a function, and i'm trying to call this.doUpdate();
[08:52:31] <shoky> mbrzuzy: you can cache "this" outside of the event handler. e.g. var self = this;
[08:53:08] <shoky> mbrzuzy: if you need more help, we'd need to see your plugin code and what you're trying to do
[08:55:19] <mbrzuzy> shoky, good idea.  Here is the code, http://pastebin.com/NPnKMzF9
[08:56:07] <Skullclown> anyone around that has used Intel's App Framework?
[08:56:34] <shoky> mbrzuzy: so either what i said with var self = this;  or you can  $(window).bind('scroll', function() { ... }.bind(this) );
[08:58:39] <mbrzuzy> shoky, worked perfectly! Thank you so much for the help :)
[08:58:44] <shoky> mbrzuzy: another option might be:  $(window).bind('scroll',  this.doUpdate )
[08:59:05] <shoky> actually scratch that
[08:59:27] <shoky> you'd need this.doUpdate.bind(this)  prolly instead
[09:06:27] <j_wolf> I need to bounce an idea off of someone. I am mimicking a lightbox right now. When the absolutely positioned div appears, an overlay goes over the page. Inside of the div are jquery ui tabs. About us, contact us, faqs, so on and so forth. On the page, there are corresponding links. What I want to do is if someone clicks on About Us on the page, it brings up the tabs box to the about us tab. If someone clicks on the faqs, it 
[09:06:52] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a bootstrap dropdown. What i want to do is, when the user selected a value from the dropdown, show it as selected
[09:06:55] <Krambiorix> how can i do that?
[09:07:48] <j_wolf> Krambiorix: on click, I'd addClass, and have a css class premade for how you want it to show
[09:08:28] <Krambiorix> j_wolf, i don't quite understand
[09:08:54] <Skullclown> Krambiorix: .click(function() { $(this).addClass(...); });
[09:08:55] <j_wolf> well when they select the value, does the dropdown remain dropped down?
[09:09:03] <j_wolf> ^that
[09:09:56] <Skullclown> but your question is vague - "when a user selected a value, show it as selected", this is default behaviour for any dropdown
[09:10:28] <Krambiorix> Skullclown, like a normal select dropdown, when the value is clicked, show it as selected
[09:10:47] <Skullclown> Krambiorix: any dropdown will show the selected value
[09:10:52] <Skullclown> that's the point of a dropdown.
[09:10:58] <Krambiorix> Skullclown, j_wolf it's a dropdown <div><ul><li></li>....
[09:10:58] <Enverex> I can see a million ways of checking if an image has loaded, but is there any way of knowing if the "background-image" for a DIV loaded successfully?
[09:11:37] <Skullclown> Krambiorix: ah, ok.
[09:12:37] <Skullclown> Krambiorix: aren't those supposed to be dropdown menus? Not select dropdowns?
[09:12:54] <j_wolf> Krambiorix: so .click(function(){$('yourUpperDiv').html($(this).attr('id'));}  ? something to that effect...double check the syntax
[09:13:27] <j_wolf> you'd have to have each value in your li to have a certain attribute, for this I use id as an example
[09:13:49] <Skullclown> is your "dropdown" anything like these examples? http://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-dropdown/#2
[09:14:10] <Skullclown> if so, that's meant to be used as a regular navigation menu and I'm sure there are simpler ways to implement a regular select dropdown.
[09:15:23] <Krambiorix> Skullclown, something like http://www.w3resource.com/twitter-bootstrap/pills-based-dropdown.png
[09:15:43] <Skullclown> that's a navigation menu.
[09:16:25] <Saaether> Krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/EtNxW/ is this what you want to do?
[09:17:29] <Krambiorix> Saaether, "Action" would be replaced by the value of the selected one
[09:18:24] <Skullclown> Krambiorix: use a select dropdown & style it like your navigation menu.
[09:22:22] <Saaether> Krambiorix http://jsfiddle.net/EtNxW/1/ like this?
[09:22:53] <Enverex> Anyone?
[09:23:01] <shoky> Enverex: don't think so. you'd need to load the same image as an <img> or Image()
[09:23:30] <Krambiorix> Saaether, thanks! that's it
[09:24:30] <Enverex> shoky: That seems a bit wasteful
[09:25:18] <shoky> Enverex: wasteful in code maybe.. but it's not like the browser will have to download the image twice. unless it's dumb
[09:25:39] <Enverex> shoky: Ah, I see what you mean
[09:41:32] <EGreg> hey guys
[09:41:39] <EGreg> do I have to escape the $url in a selector when I do this:
[09:41:50] <EGreg> $('.something[data-action=$url]')
[09:42:53] <Skullclown> EGreg: what is $url?
[09:46:37] <EGreg> it's a standin for any url
[09:46:41] <EGreg> it could be http://yahoo.com?2h4jk34lh5234
[09:51:43] <shoky> EGreg: i think you'll be fine if you quote it:   $('.something[data-action="http://url"]')
[09:52:28] <shoky> EGreg: though safest bet is: $('.something').filter(function() { return $(this).data('action') === "http://url" })
[09:52:54] <EGreg>  yeah I guess that's the safest thanks
[09:56:03] <Koln> Hello
[09:56:10] <Koln> are there any irc channels for jquery mobile?
[09:56:17] <Saaether> you're in it
[09:56:20] <arschmitz> koln this is it
[09:56:38] <Koln> alright
[09:58:18] <Koln> I am trying to handle case where clicking a link will return page with 403 status, that causes jqm to trigger 'pageloadfailed'-event. From that event, I am trying to navigate user to 'login'-page, but with no success
[09:59:03] <Koln> Did I understood right from API-manual, that what I want is to be done with data.deferred.resolve function
[09:59:34] <Koln> but before that I need to load the login page, with mobile.loadPage function?
[10:20:17] <donp> Good Morning/Afternoon bros, anyone know if there is a limit to the number of terms you can have in the 'typeahead' source array? I am trying to use a ton and it seems to cut off at like #1369
[10:22:23] <mentoc> Anyone familiar with firebug?
[10:33:01] <BillCriswell> donp: That's a random number to cut off at.
[10:34:00] <donp> yeah i agree, so i thought maybe it was server memory or something but that looks fine as far as I can tell
[10:34:25] <donp> its a list of every city in the US, so its likes 30,000 cities
[10:34:40] <donp> stops at some city in Alabama and nothing after that shows up
[10:35:44] <donp> pretty much my first experience with javascript too, so I was thinking maybe the java var only holds so many array elements?
[10:36:07] <donp> been on a google hunt for awhile now, will keep searching though

[11:16:50] <lamarus> building a jquery library.   in my init function I have `this.$el.on('click', this.titleBarClick(this.$el));` why does the function this.titleBarClick() get called on init    and not on click
[11:17:02] <lamarus> *plugin not library
[11:17:58] <Krambiorix> Saaether, still there?
[11:18:11] <Saaether> some what
[11:20:18] <Dorf> what is the best way to go about making a horizontal scrolling site?
[11:20:35] <Skullclown> anyone familiar with Intel's App Framework?
[11:21:03] <Krambiorix> Saaether, you gave me http://jsfiddle.net/EtNxW/1/     -> is it possible that this doesn't work in a dialog?
[11:21:10] <Koln> lamarus, because u should pass callback to 'on' function
[11:21:35] <Koln> not its using result of titlebarclick as callback
[11:21:39] <Koln> now*
[11:22:02] <lamarus> Koln… Example?
[11:22:36] <Koln> if you just read the manual, it tells you what parameters .on wants
[11:23:21] <Koln> .on( events [, selector ] [, data ], handler(eventObject) )
[11:23:22] <Krambiorix> Saaether, the html is created when pushing a button...
[11:23:38] <Koln> handler: A function to execute when the event is triggered.
[11:23:41] <Koln> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:23:51] <Koln> you have not pass the handler parameter
[11:23:59] <Saaether> if its being dynamically created you would need to use .on() instead of click()
[11:24:05] <lamarus> Thanks
[11:28:00] <lamarus> Koln… Saaether    doing it this way… I will not have access to using this. in the titleBarClick function… correct?
[11:29:38] <Koln> this.$el.on('click', function() {this.titleBarClick(this.$el) } ));
[11:30:05] <Koln> notice that code will propably fail because you intend to use "this" from different scope
[11:30:15] <lamarus> Koln… right.. that is what I have… but I am now getting … ya different scope on this
[11:30:42] <Koln> are you trying to lauach titlebarclick everytime some element is clicked?
[11:30:43] <lamarus> I want this to reference the global scope this…
[11:30:48] <lamarus> I am
[11:30:59] <Koln> then use window.titleBarClick
[11:31:15] <lamarus> ok
[11:31:29] <Skullclown> lamarus: this means whatever it means depending on scope, you can't make it mean something else it that's what you're trying to do.
[11:31:38] <Skullclown> if *
[11:31:43] <Koln> $('title').on('click', titleBarClick)
[11:31:59] <Koln> You dont need to pass element to function, as in function element is "this"
[11:32:20] <lamarus> I didnt know if I could do something on the titleBarClick function and end it with (this) and make it reference this as the global
[11:32:58] <Koln> everything that is global can be used as method or property of "window" object
[11:33:29] <Koln> if you want to change "this" in function, u should use call
[11:33:36] <Skullclown> lamarus: jsfiddle/demo of what you're actually trying to do
[11:33:43] <lamarus> Ill do that
[11:34:01] <Koln> titleBarClick.call(window) <- this will execute titleBarClick function as "window" as this
[11:34:08] <Sirisian|Work> So I want to put a button into an accordion floated to the right. Would this be a proper way to do it: http://jsfiddle.net/zpK6k/2/ ?
[11:34:22] <Koln> but that is so useless, because window object can be use inside function anyway
[11:34:59] <Skullclown> Koln: wait till he posts a demo
[11:38:07] <lamarus> Skullclown Koln http://jsfiddle.net/bretterer/7TLLS/
[11:38:49] <lamarus> This is a very basic right now… just to show the parts that are having the issues
[11:39:23] <lamarus> And i understand that this.titlebarClick() on line 14 is not going to call titleBarClick because of scope on this
[11:39:28] <Bloomberg> Someone know if I insert succesfully a new record in table with jTable set the message of success?
[11:39:30] <lamarus> my question is how to get this working
[11:40:27] <Bloomberg> Now Insert the record succesfully but show me a n error message!
[11:47:11] <lamarus> Skullclown Koln does that make sense?
[11:56:39] <lamarus> Got it
[12:09:45] <Pal> Hi i have a html page response by using ajax.....in that i wanna to read values based on class name or id ....Is this possible
[12:18:29] <Sirisian|Work> Is jquery ui stuff just inflexible? I'm trying to float a button to the right in an accordion without messing anything up and having it work on all browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/zpK6k/3/ so I thought that would work but it's like the text doesn't know how to stay in the center like everything else.
[12:21:19] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: you are mixing jqueryui with jquerymobile?
[12:21:22] <eddiemonge> why?
[12:21:28] <Sirisian|Work> they don't work together?
[12:21:58] <eddiemonge> ui is more for desktop whereas mobile is more for, you know, mobile
[12:22:06] <eddiemonge> jquerymobile has its own accordion
[12:22:10] <Sirisian|Work> ah
[12:22:20] <Sirisian|Work> so I don't need jquery ui at all?
[12:22:22] <eddiemonge> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/widgets/accordions/
[12:22:25] <eddiemonge> no
[12:22:32] <robert_> so I'm trying to follow a tutorial on how to write basic plug-ins, but it isn't exactly working the way I'd hoped. :/
[12:23:42] <lucenut> So I have jquery 1.7.2 and jquery.validate 1.5.5
[12:23:42] * jedimind hugs robert_ 
[12:23:45] <jedimind> it'll be okay buddy
[12:23:45] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, kind of lacks the animations. :\
[12:23:57] <robert_> jedimind: thanks. :p
[12:23:58] <jedimind> Sirisian|Work youre better off not doing animations for uneccessary things on mobile
[12:24:01] <Sirisian|Work> I think I'll just use jquery ui. I'm working on a large tablet device.
[12:24:05] <lucenut> My radio buttons are enforced "required" just by putting class="required"
[12:24:23] <lucenut> But they don't get highlighted like every other required formfield.
[12:24:25] <robert_> so I'm trying to get something like $.help_context() going, but I'm not sure how, lol
[12:24:28] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: its also weird having a button in a "button" ie the header
[12:24:33] <Sirisian|Work> this is a powerful i5 type hardware on a large touch device. figured the mobile version would come in handy
[12:24:39] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: it has transitions
[12:25:14] <eddiemonge> robert_: $.help_context = function() { your code })
[12:25:31] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, is that in the documentation? I'd like to use jquery mobile since this is a touch device but I need clean animations.
[12:25:35] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: surface?
[12:25:41] <robert_> eddiemonge: and that would work inside callbacks and the like?
[12:25:44] <lucenut> http://pastebin.com/nmZFt1Sf
[12:26:00] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, kind of.
[12:26:03] <eddiemonge> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/widgets/transitions/
[12:26:05] <Sirisian|Work> just single touch though
[12:26:13] <eddiemonge> robert_: what are you trying to do?
[12:26:31] <jedimind> oh you guys wanna see some sexy transtiions ?
[12:26:42] <jedimind> http://tympanus.net/Development/ModalWindowEffects/
[12:26:48] <lucenut> Anyone know if there's a bug in the validate for radio buttons?
[12:26:59] <eddiemonge> lucenut: have one be selected by default
[12:27:15] <robert_> eddiemonge: well, I have a tab callback that I'd like to use $.help_context() inside; it's a sort of online help system using html5 data attributes.
[12:27:31] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, more talking about accordion animations.
[12:28:08] <eddiemonge> robert_: you need to be more descriptive
[12:28:24] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: look at the source. it also probabyl wouldnt be too hard to write your own in
[12:30:02] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, yeah I can't use their accordion. It's missing a lot of features I need. The UI one should be fine.
[12:30:23] <Sirisian|Work> Thanks though for showing me that the APIs are separate. That clears things up a lot
[12:37:03] <zeromodulus> What are some good photo gallery plugins?
[12:48:47] <Bloomberg> clear
[12:48:51] <Bloomberg> someone here?
[12:49:55] <Skullclown> Bloomberg
[12:50:19] <Bloomberg> Skullclown: Thank you man..
[12:50:25] <Bloomberg> can do you help me?
[12:50:49] <Skullclown> Bloomberg: I don't have your question in my chat log :)
[12:51:10] <Bloomberg> do you have worked with jTale?
[12:51:19] <Skullclown> no
[12:51:38] <Skullclown> sorry :)
[12:51:39] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/PpukP/
[12:51:44] <Bloomberg> see that plz
[12:52:26] <Skullclown> Bloomberg: ok, what's the issue?
[12:52:38] <Bloomberg> Really I have two issues
[12:52:56] <Bloomberg> The first : I need to change the success message when I add a new record
[12:53:19] <Skullclown> why do you have "function loadTotTableContact(){" with $(document).ready in it? o.o
[12:53:51] <Bloomberg> Because I add a new record and doesn't show me nothing, but when I delete a file works perfect but show me an error log
[12:54:11] <Bloomberg> is wrong it?
[12:54:22] <Skullclown> Bloomberg: I meant you don't need the function definition if you want to call it on document ready :)
[12:54:40] <Bloomberg> Ok
[12:55:54] <Bloomberg> And the success message
[12:56:38] <Bloomberg> What do you suggest me?
[12:56:40] <Skullclown> Bloomberg: can you show me contactos/insertDataContact ?
[12:57:51] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/zPCZssMY
[12:58:42] <Skullclown> Bloomberg: so that PHP page is returning nothing at all?
[12:59:24] <Skullclown> the jtable examples return an array with 2 entries: Result and Record
[13:00:27] <BillCriswell> http://devdocs.io/ Daaammmmnnnnn
[13:00:55] <Bloomberg> But if I need when the record is created succesfully, how can I set a new message like ::  "Record created succesfully"
[13:01:08] <Skullclown> BillCriswell: fancy
[13:01:10] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, http://jsfiddle.net/zpK6k/4/ hmm yeah header is still offset. Any ideas about a simple fix?
[13:01:20] <BillCriswell> Skullclown: Nice and fast too.
[13:01:35] <BillCriswell> This may be my future homepage.
[13:02:19] <Skullclown> BillCriswell: bookmarked
[13:02:27] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: what is that search supposed to do?
[13:03:24] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, each tab has two views. You click search and it brings up a search interface for that content. It also changes to a close search button when you do that.
[13:03:38] <Sirisian|Work> /s/tab/accordion content
[13:04:23] <eddiemonge> Sirisian|Work: why cant that go inside the tab?
[13:05:10] <Sirisian|Work> eddiemonge, So that on a quick look a person can sees they can click search right there.
[13:05:18] <Sirisian|Work> see*
[13:05:31] <eddiemonge> but if that tab is contracted, it still shows
[13:07:22] <Sirisian|Work> Say that section is called "Shows" and there are tons of other groups of data. If the person wants to search for shows they can just click the search button. I guess if this is going to be hard I can move it down into the content group.
[13:08:44] <eddiemonge> id say that a better ui choice
[13:40:55] <lucenut> So the jquery validator script enforces "required" for radio buttons, but it doesn't highlight them like all other formfields.
[13:41:02] <lucenut> I have googled with no luck.
[13:42:16] <lucenut> I rolled my own native js function that highlights a div I put around them, then doesn't return false letting the jquery do it's thing. Kinda sketchy but it's working.
[13:42:28] <lucenut> What's a more elegant way to "fix" this?
[13:43:39] <mary_23> Anybody used highcharts before?
[13:49:39] <cbergmann> hi there. Is it correct that jQuery("#some-id","<form id='#some-id'>...</form>")  does not match or is there something wrong with my code?
[13:54:45] <vinky_> cbergmann, you usually dont put # in the id
[13:55:06] <cbergmann> sorry typ in my post. There is no # in the ID.
[13:55:10] <cbergmann> typo
[13:55:21] <eddiemonge> then there is something wrong with your code
[13:55:32] <eddiemonge> are you calling the script after that element has loaded?
[13:55:45] <miCSu> I've been thinking.. me and a pal from work have been worked with a huge amount of jquery at work but why is it that sometimes something like $("ol.class1 li.class2").something() works just for few of the elements and $("ol.class1").find("li.class2") for all? is there some specific cases that ignore the first style?
[13:56:29] <jedimind> they're different thing
[13:56:36] <jedimind> err
[13:56:41] <jedimind> sorry im slow
[13:56:45] <jedimind> ignore me
[13:57:08] <cbergmann> After reading a little more about find I found out that it only trys to match the children. So the context itself could not match. Is there a way to call find so that it could also match the whole context?
[13:57:20] <eddiemonge> miCSu: nope
[13:57:47] <eddiemonge> cbergmann: im confused now
[13:58:14] <vinky_> me too
[13:58:53] <cbergmann> The selector would match the whole context (the <form> element). But since find starts by checking the children of the given context it is not testing the selector against the whole context and therefore can not match.
[14:00:06] <eddiemonge> cbergmann: how about you paste some code because im confused by what you are saying. i understand it but i dont
[14:03:28] <cbergmann> context = $('<form id="some-id"><div id="some-other-id">...</div></form>'); context.find("#some-other-id") would select the inner div but context.find("#some-id") would match nothing.
[14:04:43] <shoky> cbergmann: .find only looks for descendants
[14:05:12] <shoky> .filter would find the root
[14:05:25] <cbergmann> and descendants?
[14:05:34] <shoky> wat?
[14:06:07] <cbergmann> would .filter("#some-other-div") also find the inner div or do I have to use two cases?
[14:07:29] <shoky> it wouldn't. you can do:  $('<div>').append('<form> ...... </form>').find(...)  to have it all in one case
[14:08:17] <bil> So I'm using $().map().get() and I'm getting back a nested array. How do I just get back the inner array? http://jsfiddle.net/RQFQu/
[14:08:49] <jasonmerino> Hey, would anyone here be able to help out with a problem I'm having getting jQuery unit tests to all pass on the most recent version of master? I'm trying to work on fixing a bug and I have failed tests right off the bat. Wondering if my setup is messed up.
[14:08:56] <shoky> bil: that's not a nested array. it's an array of objects
[14:09:18] <bil> i just want the array of objects, but its return an array with the array of nested objects inside
[14:09:32] <shoky> oh
[14:09:53] <shoky> bil: that doesn't sound right
[14:10:49] <bil> nm.. its my dumb console.log() wrapper thats sticking the output inside an array
[14:11:02] <bil> im dumb
[14:14:40] <Birliban> Hi, i want to increase the integer value of an input element with 1. So how do do it the most effective way? $("#pretime").val(this+1); doesn't work....
[14:15:10] <miCSu> eddiemonge: shouldn't them be exactly the same? has happened more than once after hitting head to wall for a few hours
[14:15:22] <shoky> Birliban: pass a function to .val()
[14:17:01] <jasonmerino> Hi, I'm having trouble getting all of the unit tests to run from the current master branch. Is this where I could find help with that?
[14:17:25] <shoky> jasonmerino: i can try to help
[14:17:31] <eddiemonge> miCSu: they should be yes
[14:17:44] <eddiemonge> you substituted them in the same exact location?
[14:18:07] <Birliban> shoky, ok, whats inside the function? return this + 1; doesnt work either... result is: [object HTMLInputElement]1
[14:18:11] <shoky> jasonmerino: are you running it on a webserver with PHP support e.g. apache?
[14:18:26] <shoky> Birliban: did you check the docs for .val() ?
[14:18:30] <jasonmerino> shoky: cool! I've pulled down the latest copy of the master branch, built it and when I run the tests I get an error in the console that says:
[14:18:32] <jasonmerino> Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that 'style-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
[14:18:37] <eddiemonge> cbergmann: why dont you console.log that string and see what is returned
[14:18:48] <Birliban> shoky, will do so ;-) brb
[14:19:31] <shoky> jasonmerino, got a phone call, bbs
[14:19:41] <cbergmann> thanks. I will most likely use two calls one with find and one with filter.
[14:20:00] <jasonmerino> shoky: cool. :)
[14:20:32] <miCSu> eddiemonge: yup, actually today was trying with :last operator but does it make a difference? I thought it shouldn't when using something like $("ol.class li:last")
[14:21:52] <eddiemonge> cbergmann: http://jsfiddle.net/bcBpU/
[14:22:14] <eddiemonge> miCSu: huh?
[14:23:30] <shoky> jasonmerino: how are you running the tests?
[14:23:42] <jasonmerino> shoky: Chrome
[14:24:02] <jasonmerino> shoky: 27.0.1453.116
[14:24:17] <shoky> jasonmerino: and what webserver?
[14:24:32] <jasonmerino> localhost/test
[14:24:45] <shoky> apache?
[14:25:01] <jasonmerino> Yeah, MAMP.
[14:26:39] <shoky> and what does chrome show? not in the console
[14:27:04] <jasonmerino> Shows the tests, the first test that fails is #39
[14:27:31] <jasonmerino> Correction, the only test that fails.
[14:28:38] <shoky> jasonmerino: and if you click Rerun on that test it still fails?
[14:29:08] <shoky> which test is that?
[14:29:17] <jasonmerino> Yeah.
[14:29:25] <jasonmerino> core: jQuery.each(Object,Function)
[14:29:42] <shoky> what's it failing on?
[14:29:54] <limpc> hi guys.
[14:29:54] <jasonmerino> Iteration over document.styleSheets
[14:30:06] <jasonmerino> Expected 2, result 3
[14:30:54] <limpc> i have a client that wants to use custom buttons for the jqueryui confirmation dialog.  im having trouble finding info on how to do this - the only thing I've found is how to specify buttons via buttons: function() { } but that doesnt seem to allow me to customize its design
[14:31:08] <limpc> like for example they want a red 'cancel' button using their own background graphic
[14:31:25] <limpc> and the cancel button floating left, and the other button floating right on opposite ends
[14:32:15] <limpc> any suggestions or can someone point me to the api documentation on doing something like this?
[14:32:22] <eddiemonge> limpc: css
[14:32:50] <limpc> eddiemonge: of course. but you cant specify css attributes with the button: { } stuff, as far as I can tell?
[14:33:19] <eddiemonge> no but you can add a custom class
[14:33:26] <eddiemonge> jasonmerino: ask in #jquery-dev
[14:33:49] <limpc> eddiemonge: yeah but you cant specify unique css attributes for each button. they arent distinguishable
[14:34:11] <limpc> they use generic jqueryui css classes
[14:34:21] <jasonmerino> eddiemonge: I was thinking that might be a better venue. Thanks!
[14:34:27] <DarkSector_> Hi! How do I make the datepicker disappear the moment I click on a date? Here's my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/LtTr5/
[14:35:56] <shoky> jasonmerino: seems related to  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=189184
[14:36:13] <shoky> i see jquery devs commented there too
[14:36:50] <shoky> jasonmerino: but generally unless you're fixing a bug that's directly related to that failing test, you shouldn't worry about it TOO much
[14:37:30] <jasonmerino> shoky: Alright, thanks. That helps if it's a problem others are having that's good to know. :)
[14:40:09] <shoky> jasonmerino: ah and that test is specifically mentioned here http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13507
[14:40:15] <eddiemonge> DarkSector_: effin eh. thats not datepicker. thats bootstrap datepicker
[14:40:21] <limpc> so, no suggestions on how to solve this problem?
[14:40:29] <limpc> ive been looking around for a couple hours now
[14:40:39] <DarkSector_> eddiemonge: shit. Sorry, I should've provided the link :| My bad
[14:40:49] <DarkSector_> http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
[14:40:52] <jasonmerino> shoky: Cool. Thanks man!
[14:41:01] <eddiemonge> DarkSector_: no wonder logical things werent working
[14:41:22] <DarkSector_> eddiemonge: I know, I should've said something. I am so scattered today. My bad
[14:41:35] <shoky> jasonmerino: np
[14:42:34] <eddiemonge> limpc: one minute
[14:43:24] <eddiemonge> DarkSector_: look at the events section of that page. on changeDate datepicker("hide")
[14:44:04] <DarkSector_> Yes, I saw that, I have tried to use it, but I haven't been able to get it to work. Let me update my JSFiddle to actually show what I've done
[14:44:08] <DarkSector_> s/done/tried
[14:45:47] <mary_23> is it bad to place the js code in the html page?
[14:48:11] <eddiemonge> limpc: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6702279/jquery-ui-dialog-buttons-how-to-add-class
[14:48:25] <miCSu> eddiemonge: so the $("ol.class li:last").show() returned less than ("ol.class").find("li:last").show(), bit confusing for me
[14:48:36] <eddiemonge> mary_23: depends on how much code there is and if it should be cached
[14:48:58] <eddiemonge> example?
[14:48:58] <limpc> eddiemonge: yeah i thought of that. but its kind of hackish. i dont want to have to apply js to every page on the site
[14:49:09] <mary_23> eddiemonge:  what do you mean by cached
[14:49:14] <limpc> there should be a way to do it with the native .dialog({}) somehow?
[14:49:35] <eddiemonge> limpc: are the buttons going to be the same on every dialog? if so then just overwrite the jquery-ui theme in your css
[14:49:37] <limpc> well i mean obviously this is in the dialog routine. but what i mean is in the button: { } part
[14:49:46] <eddiemonge> mary_23: browser saved
[14:50:07] <limpc> eddiemonge: the 'cancel' will. but theres no specific theme class just for the cancel button
[14:50:18] <eddiemonge> limpc: it creates and calls .button() but that doesn't let you add custom classes either, which is odd
[15:18:33] <rabidsnail> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L151 is throwing 'TypeError: "".match is not a function' for some reason?
[15:18:45] <rabidsnail> it's happening in firefox and in safari
[15:20:14] <rabidsnail> which is bizarre, because String.prototype.match is a function...
[15:46:18] <shoky> rabidsnail: what're you doing exactly?
[15:47:32] <rabidsnail> shoky: I'm calling unbind() to unbind a click handler
[15:47:55] <shoky> rabidsnail: can you reproduce the issue on a jsfiddle?

[16:37:58] <abjorn> :o
[16:39:00] <jduan1981> question about sending POST reuests via $.post and $.ajax. When the service isn't very responsive and I send multiple POST requests in a row quickly to the same URL, it seems $.post and $.ajax have different caching behavior. Does anyone have experience with these 2 methods?
[16:39:58] <jduan1981> it seems $.ajax doesn't cache requests so it sends multiple requests out but $.post only sends one POST request even when you send multiple requests
[16:41:59] <Koln> post is just a shortcut for ajax
[16:42:02] <Koln> see the source code
[16:42:30] <jduan1981> why do they have different behaviors then?
[16:42:46] <Koln> return jQuery.ajax({url: url,	type: method,dataType: type,data: data,success: callback});
[16:43:00] <Koln> that is jquery source for post
[16:43:04] <NaN> I have an ajaxSuccess attached to document, I have a click that does $.ajax but before make the call I assign some vars, is there a way to work with that vars in ajaxSuccess? (if the ajax is ok)
[16:45:11] <Skullclown> NaN: better code structure will fix that issue
[16:45:56] <NaN> Skullclown: example?
[17:10:34] <delinquentme> $(function () {   /* The jquery im used to seeing */    })
[17:11:02] <delinquentme> ^ when a js document opens like this ... this is defining an anon function to have everything execute inside?
[17:11:04] <delinquentme> why?
[17:16:18] <Eviltwin> delinquentme: The $(function () { ... }) is a shortcut for $(document).ready(function () { ... })
[17:16:33] <Eviltwin> delinquentme: It means all the code inside will run once the DOM has finished downloading and parsing (i.e. all elements in the HTML are available)
[17:16:37] <delinquentme> oh!
[17:23:37] <delinquentme> so without throwing up a js fiddle ...
[17:24:03] <delinquentme> if i've got functions loaded on DOM load ... I should then have access to those functions from basically anywhere
[17:24:04] <delinquentme> RIGHT?
[17:24:15] <delinquentme> what might make this untrue?
[17:29:03] <grafi> hard to tell without any kind of code ^^
[17:29:04] <Eviltwin> I don't understand what you mean by functions loaded on DOM load
[17:29:18] <Eviltwin> If you mean you're loading in new JavaScript after DOM load then no
[17:29:48] <Eviltwin> If you mean they're functions defined inside $(function () { ... }) then also no
[17:29:52] <Eviltwin> Because JavaScript has function scope
[17:30:17] <Eviltwin> Meaning that everything defined inside a function () { ... } can be accessed inside but not outside those brackets
[17:57:01] <oojacoboo> anyone have any idea why when I used an event for blur, it only fires on first blur, but not on any subsequent ones… it also actually fires on focus :/
[17:57:07] <oojacoboo> it's for an input
[18:15:43] <Ansikt> oojacoboo: There's somethin' wierd goin on.  Can you provide us with some code?
[18:15:58] <oojacoboo> Ansikt: I think I found it, there was another event being registered
[18:16:11] <Ansikt> Cool beans.
[18:19:38] <aghouseh> anyone had insight on trying to create a js object from form elements that utilize arrays? e.g. <input name="akID[47][atSelectOptionID][]" value="2"/> <input name="akID[47][atSelectOptionID][]" value="5"/>, etc
[18:22:26] <Ansikt> aghouseh:  Regexp capturing groups?
[18:22:58] <Ansikt> There's also eval, but as they say, eval is evil.
[18:23:28] <aghouseh> Ansikt: yeah, that's gonna have to be it, but yeah, eval is brutal and json.parse() wont work that way apparently
[18:23:35] <aghouseh> JSON.parse() that is
[18:24:05] <Ansikt> That being said, that's a wierdass thing to do.  Is there a plugin doing this or something?
[18:24:35] <aghouseh> heh well, working within the constraints of a cms
[18:24:58] <aghouseh> trying to hook into their default attribute rendering for a filtering situation.. its complex i guess.
[18:26:58] <aghouseh> oy i have a simple regex that i found, but this sucker is gonna need recursion
[18:48:00] <ggdevelop> hey, i having 2 ajax 'get' calls, the secend call is in the callback function of the firs. but its not execute
[18:49:42] <Ansikt> ggdevelop: the callback is shorthand for 'success.'  Methinks your first ajax call isn't succeeding.
[18:49:58] <Ansikt> Have you tried filling every other line with console.log like a boss?
[18:54:10] <ggdevelop> in the first ajax call,in the call back function: i add a <div> and link <a> to my html,  and then with another  ajax call (inner ahax call) in the callback function i ahava alert. and the alert not show up when i run the code
[18:55:10] <Ansikt> ggdevelop, okay, so you know the first get is succeeding...what if you append a .fail(alert('failing')); to the end of the $.get()?
[18:55:44] <ggdevelop> ill try
[18:58:57] <ggdevelop> how can i do so? if im using the syntax $get("somthing.php",{data:mydata},function(){ alert ("seccsess"); })
[19:00:18] <Ansikt> $get("somthing.php",{data:mydata},function(){ alert ("seccsess"); }).fail(function(){alert(failing)});
[19:00:29] <Ansikt> My bad:  screwed up the syntax for both get and fail!
[19:02:02] <ggdevelop> Ansikt: yes it failing in the second ajax call
[19:04:41] <ggdevelop> Ansikt: but what can be the cause that the second one is failing?
[19:06:51] <Ansikt> Is the url correct?  If nothing else, use ajaxSetup to get error messaging
[19:10:43] <ggdevelop> is there a way to debag jquery ajax call?
[19:11:09] <Ansikt> Heh.  Debag
[19:11:29] <Ansikt> And yes!  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/
[19:12:22] <Ansikt> I use old jQuery at work.  Forgive me, that's deprecated.  Here: http://api.jquery.com/ajaxError/
[19:13:26] <Ansikt> Basically: bind this event to the document, alert() the exception out and you should see your problem.
[19:22:57] <ggdevelop> Ansikt: i didnt understend how to use this div.log
[19:23:37] <ggdevelop> Ansikt: i think i dont write it correct
[19:24:08] <Ansikt> That's a css selector being used by jQuery's default selector engine.  I feel that you should read up more on the basics of how jQuery works before attempting to do the more complex stuff like Ajax.

[22:46:56] <aro>  how do you convert a JSON object to a javascript array?
[22:47:06] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[22:47:11] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ aro
[22:47:11] <b-ot> aro: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:47:12] <bot-t> aro, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[22:47:18] <Eviltwin> Not sure what you mean by that
[22:47:51] <aro> i have this json object returned via ajax: {"Offbeatr":"Offbeatr"}
[22:47:56] <aro> i want to convert it to an array
[22:48:07] <Eviltwin> An array that looks like..?
[22:48:26] <aro> erm.. an array?
[22:48:42] <Eviltwin> An array has indices (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...)
[22:48:52] <Eviltwin> So what's index 0 for {"Offbeatr":"Offbeatr"} ?
[22:48:59] <aro> basically, if i do console.log(parsedArray); i get: ["test1", "test2", "test3"] or something thereof
[22:49:11] <aro> instead of: Object {Offbeatr: "Offbeatr"}
[22:49:23] <aro> obviously test1,test2 would be different
[22:49:29] <Eviltwin> ....
[22:49:43] <Eviltwin> I think you've become confused
[22:49:49] <aro> i dont know how this isnt making sense
[22:49:56] <aro> ones an object ones an array
[22:50:00] <Eviltwin> It's because you're probably using the wrong words
[22:50:02] <aro> i dont want an object, i want an array
[22:50:10] <Eviltwin> AN ARRAY THAT CONTAINS WHAT?
[22:50:15] <aro> i dont care about indicies, just values
[22:50:20] <Eviltwin> Let's say I have this object: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
[22:50:24] <Eviltwin> What array do you want from that?
[22:50:32] <aro> [1,2,3]
[22:50:43] <Eviltwin> Okay, necessarily in that order?
[22:50:48] <Eviltwin> Objects don't have an implied order
[22:51:02] <aro> it doesnt matter
[22:51:08] <Eviltwin> And for the record what you are asking for is referred to the values of the object
[22:51:20] <Eviltwin> Whereas the array ["a", "b", "c"] would be called the keys of the object
[22:51:28] <Eviltwin> Neither of which are referred to as the "array" of the object
[22:52:01] <aro> i did specify values
[22:52:02] <aro> earlier
[22:52:12] <aro> <aro> i dont care about indicies, just values
[22:52:57] <Eviltwin> So in jQuery the easiest way to do this is to use $.map: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[22:53:25] <Eviltwin> And do $.map(object, function (value) { return value; })
[22:53:34] <aro> ok hang on
[22:54:46] <Eviltwin> And the "fastest" way is this: http://pastebin.com/vSRtgmwR
[22:55:01] <aro> thats faster?
[22:55:52] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:56:14] <aro> ok cool
[22:56:25] <aro> im trying to use the jquery autocomplete and its not working very well
[22:57:16] <aro> Uncaught TypeError: Object function (e,t){return new b.fn.init(e,t,r)} has no method 'curCSS'
[22:57:38] <Eviltwin> Do you have a stack trace for that?
[22:57:42] <Eviltwin> Or a demo
[22:57:45] <Eviltwin> on jsFiddle
[22:58:28] <aro> heres a stack trace http://pastebin.com/YzsuwqKs
[23:00:06] <Eviltwin> Looks like you probably have a mismatch between your jQuery UI version and jQuery version
[23:01:00] <aro> i am using jquery 1.9.1 and jqueryui 1.8.18
[23:01:15] <aro> thats old
[23:01:16] <aro> isnt it
[23:42:37] <aro> eviltwin you here
