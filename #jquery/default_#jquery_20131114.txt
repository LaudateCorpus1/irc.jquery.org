[00:08:31] <doev> can I change the target for a jquerui-menu from <ul> to <div>?
[00:10:16] <Cork> well the entries is built up of li's so that would make the structure invalid
[00:11:05] <tab1293> does anyone know why after a long ajax some of my selectors dont work in the success function?
[00:11:25] <donta> I have been trying to get a autocomplete search feature working, but I just can't figure it out... would anyone be able to point me in the right direction to hire somebody?
[00:11:26] <tab1293> when I stop the script on the selector line the selected element is faded in firebug instead of bold
[00:11:57] <Cork> tab1293: check so the selectors actually doesn't match anything
[00:12:04] <Cork> $(selector).length
[00:12:15] <Cork> tab1293: might be you are getting duplicate id's
[00:12:19] <Cork> (for example)
[00:12:35] <tab1293> Cork, Ill check but I don't think thats the case
[00:13:04] <Cork> are you using dom references or selectors?
[00:13:21] <Cork> actually; show the code
[00:14:28] <ravenzz> Cork hi, have you ever implemented ajax file uploading?
[00:14:36] <Cork> ya
[00:14:41] <tab1293> Cork, http://www.pastebin.ca/2476011
[00:15:07] <tab1293> the weird thing is that sometimes it will successfully hide the popover but if the ajax request takes really long (like 30 seconds) it won't hide it
[00:15:07] <Cork> O_o
[00:15:12] <Cork> a white page?
[00:15:27] <Cork> tab1293: jsfiddle.net please or jsbin.com
[00:15:36] <ravenzz> Cork I am doing a bit of researching before to start with the implementation, is xhr2 (FormData) the way to go? (fallback to iframe upload for legacy browsers)
[00:15:53] <Cork> ravenzz: yup
[00:16:02] <tab1293> Cork, that link should work
[00:16:05] <Cork> at least if you want to send more then just the file data
[00:16:46] <ravenzz> what do you mean with "more then just the file data"
[00:17:16] <Cork> tab1293: then the problem is that you don't have any code http://imagebin.org/276958
[00:17:40] <Cork> ravenzz: there is filereaders you can use instead
[00:18:04] <Cork> but it is more for use in the page then uploads
[00:18:10] <ravenzz> yeah
[00:18:48] <ravenzz> but I guess it could be useful to look into that if I also want to implement drag and drop upload
[00:45:03] <hurdos> Hello
[00:47:05] <hurdos> Why can not I pass the variable 'this' inside my inner function to jquery function like $.each?
[00:47:22] <Cork> hurdos: this is defined when a function is called
[00:47:31] <Cork> so it is ALWAYS local to a function
[00:47:40] <Cork> do something like var self = this;
[00:47:46] <Cork> and then use self in the second function
[00:48:04] <hurdos> so, I need use something like this 'var self = this;'?
[00:48:05] <Cork> hurdos: this isn't jquery specific, it's just how javascript works
[00:48:10] <Cork> yes
[00:48:16] <Cork> outside the second function
[00:48:17] <hurdos> thanks
[00:54:36] <jaroslaw> Hello! I use JQuery UI autocomplete plugin. How I select some element in input by code?
[00:54:51] <Kneta> Can anyone recommend a good jquery-library for google-maps? Seems to be a zillion out there, not sure which one to use.
[00:54:59] <jaroslaw> *will select
[00:55:26] <Cork> jaroslaw: what do you mean?
[00:55:33] <jaroslaw> Kneta: http://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/
[00:58:30] <jaroslaw> Cork: User can ckick on input, write some symbols, get some elements in searchbox and select some element. So, it cause event - autocompleteselect. But, how I make this not by user, just by code? Something like this - $('#search_country').autocomplete("select", "New-York");
[00:59:00] <Cork> ah you want to trigger a search?
[00:59:04] <xec> jaroslaw: $('#search_country').val("New-York") ?
[00:59:33] <xec> i think he just wants to write a value to the input?
[01:01:42] <jaroslaw> xec: $('#search_country').val("New-York") - Do it happen autocompleteselect event?
[01:02:00] <Cork> jaroslaw: no
[01:02:00] <jaroslaw> xec: for some handlers
[01:02:15] <Cork> that just sets the value on the input
[01:02:16] <jaroslaw> Cork: but I need)
[01:02:49] <xec> well, you can .trigger() it
[01:03:03] <jomofcw> Hello ! Is there some official guide about "how to migrate from jQuery 1.x to jQuery 2.x please ?
[01:03:10] <Cork> i don't think trigger fires all the callbacks on jquery ui
[01:03:32] <Cork> specifically the ones passed to the widget on creation
[01:03:54] <Cork> or the internal code if there is any
[01:04:35] <Cork> the closest i know of is search
[01:04:42] <Cork> but it won't select a value
[01:04:47] <Cork> just show the dropdown
[01:06:17] <jaroslaw> Cork: strange... so, thank you! perhaps, I use val() and option "source" (+ handler) to simulate select event
[01:06:27] <jaroslaw> *will use
[01:06:52] <jaroslaw> xec: thank you
[01:08:35] <jaroslaw> hmmm... what about execute select: function () {...} in options of autocomplete?
[01:09:59] <xec> that's what cork was talking about, you might not be able to trigger it
[01:10:30] <jonkristian_wrk> What is doing the dynamic highlighting on the bootstrap page in the sidebar while scrolling? http://getbootstrap.com/css/
[01:10:56] <jonkristian_wrk> I am looking for something similar, however i just want to switch between dynamic pieces of text
[01:13:40] <TheGallery> jonkristian_wrk, bootstrap includes that feature -> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#affix
[01:14:11] <jonkristian_wrk> TheGallery, Is that the affix? I though the affix was the thing that made the sidebar fixed while scrolling?
[01:15:22] <TheGallery> no it's the highlight while scrolling

[01:17:49] <jonkristian_wrk> TheGallery, I want to do something similar, but instead of having a list of items in the sidebar i want to highlight and fade in the title for that position in a certain place, do you know of any examples like that somewhere?
[01:18:06] <xec> jaroslaw: yes, that's what I'm saying...
[01:18:24] <xec> jaroslaw: if you want to .trigger() it, use .on()
[01:18:31] <jaroslaw> xec: so, it impossible?
[01:19:07] <TheGallery> Unfortunately no jonkristian_wrk :-/ BS Affix is the closest to that feature that I know of.
[01:19:30] <xec> jaroslaw: probably not, but i don't see any simple option from the docs and not about to decipher the source ;)

[01:59:54] <adammcarth> Hey guys. Anyone down for a challenge?
[02:00:32] <adammcarth> I'm not so sure the guy who answered this has used clean code, anyone got any ideas? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19973442/vertically-center-a-content-area-until-it-reaches-a-certain-height/19974130?noredirect=1#comment29733863_19974130

[02:13:27] <netAction> Hi! What is the JavaScript equivalent to jQUery element.height()? element.get(0).style.height does not work.
[02:14:02] <Cork> window.getComputedStyle(elm).height
[02:14:37] <Cork> remember that older ie uses a different function though
[02:14:45] <netAction> hmmm
[02:15:15] <netAction> The problem is, that element.height() has effect on simultaneusly running animate().
[02:15:20] <Cork> ie uses currentStyle.height on the element
[02:15:37] <Cork> uh
[02:15:45] <Cork> well if something updates the dom, it updates the dom
[02:15:59] <Cork> if you want what it was you would have to store the value
[02:16:27] <netAction> I know. I do not change the elements height.
[02:17:29] <netAction> The animation fails. It does not run smooth but steps back and forth.
[02:18:14] <DRSK> I'm animating every 4 seconds, and to show the duration until next animation I'm animating a bar from 0 to 100% width. This is done within a setTimeout-function with the same duration as the animation (no, I can't put it in .animate()) now, how do I pause and continue from where I left off pausing?
[02:18:55] <Cork> DRSK: you would have to clear the timer
[02:19:02] <DRSK> I'm guessing somehow I can calculate the time spent from start to pause and subtract that from the total time, but I don't know how to "track" the time
[02:19:04] <Cork> and create a new one when you want to continue
[02:19:13] <Cork> or set a variable and check it in the callback
[02:19:25] <Cork> DRSK: also you might want to check on requestAnimationFrame
[02:19:35] <netAction> DRSK: Save the current timestamp.
[02:19:44] <Cork> it is much nicer to the user then setTimeout if you can use it
[02:19:46] <DRSK> I'd rather not use date()
[02:20:05] <DRSK> Cork Â» understood, going to look into requestAnimationFrame
[02:20:06] <Cork> DRSK: it is the only way to really know how far you have got through the animation
[02:20:23] <Cork> cause the callback might vary cause of other things in the browsers
[02:20:37] <Cork> so you need to base it of a time id
[02:20:52] <Cork> (requestAnimationFrame does this too)
[02:21:02] <DRSK> Yeah, I feel that could be the case as well. Doesn't feel right to have a separate setTimeout in conjunction with the animation ;p
[02:22:01] <dwarder> is it possible to add an array element to the begining of the array
[02:22:02] <dwarder> ?

[02:30:34] <xec> adammcarth: is this what you wanted? http://jsfiddle.net/gLECE/3/
[02:38:39] <adammcarth> xec: My apologies, I was away
[02:38:54] <adammcarth> xec: Agreed! I couldn't work out why in his example it was further up?
[02:39:02] <adammcarth> xec: I'll check out your fiddle now.
[02:40:27] <adammcarth> xec: Looks perfect
[02:40:56] <xec> adammcarth: i think i found i flaw in my attempt, looking at your graphic again, maybe you wanted it centered in the viewport, not centered between the top 100px and the bottom
[02:40:58] <adammcarth> xec: Any ideas why the container moves down as number 2 increases though?
[02:41:48] <adammcarth> xec: Oh. Yeah I needs to be centered in the screen, then when it reaches 100px from the top of the screen all the extra content will extend down
[02:43:36] <xec> adammcarth: http://jsfiddle.net/gLECE/4/ xD
[02:45:43] <xec> adammcarth: i'm not sure at all what that other answer is about, it doesnt seem to save space at the top either
[02:46:11] <adammcarth> xec: Yeah I thought I was going crazy - glad I got a second opinion on it!
[02:46:18] <adammcarth> xec: Checking out your fiddle now, thanks for the help.
[02:47:17] <xec> adammcarth: that last one was sort of a joke, although it fits the requirements, it only does so because the requirements say nothing about having a weird empty space at the bottom you can always scroll past
[02:47:53] <adammcarth> xec: The last one fails
[02:47:56] <adammcarth> xec: AH.
[02:51:46] <adammcarth> xec: Wtf is going on with the very last answer I downvoted
[02:52:13] <adammcarth> xec: Looks nice, I'm going to have a shot at implementing it in my project now - and I think we might have a winner.
[02:52:30] <adammcarth> is using display-table bad practise?
[02:53:05] <xec> adammcarth: absolutely not
[02:53:42] <xec> ie7 is dead
[02:54:21] <xec> using <table> for layout is bad, but display: table; in css is golden
[02:55:06] <adammcarth> xec: You know how you've actually specified a height on your container, obviously it's just a demo of someone's viewport. How would I actually set the height of that? would the best way be to identify the height with jQuery and set it that way?
[02:55:10] <xec> adammcarth: lol @ <center> in html5
[02:55:21] <adammcarth> haha yeah
[02:55:25] <adammcarth> that guy's baked.
[02:55:56] <xec> adammcarth: http://jsfiddle.net/gLECE/6/
[02:56:32] <xec> adammcarth: but instead of just doing it on page load, you might want to recalibrate on resize
[02:56:46] <adammcarth> xec: window.resize or whatever?
[02:56:58] <adammcarth> yeah. figured as much
[02:56:59] <xec> right, just make sure to throttle it
[02:57:21] <adammcarth> throttle it? sorry, new to javascript haha ^
[02:57:22] <xec> adammcarth: with those pesky tablets and smartphones with landscape/portrait mode resizes happen
[02:57:46] <xec> adammcarth: resize event fires *a lot* when someone drags the edge of a browser window http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[02:57:49] <adammcarth> Oh, yeah - and even people resizing their browsers
[02:58:09] <adammcarth> Oh cool, thanks I'll give it a read
[02:58:14] <xec> yeah but 99% of users doesn't resize the window so it's sort of a non issue
[02:58:41] <adammcarth> I do! ;0
[02:59:08] <adammcarth> xec: So throttle only fires at the end of a resize, where as the window.resize fires each like millisecond of resiszing?
[02:59:57] <xec> adammcarth: yeah you can configure it to fire every N ms or so too
[03:00:09] <xec> with throttle, that is
[03:00:17] <xec> debounce is what you're talking about
[03:00:49] <adammcarth> right.
[03:01:50] <adammcarth> but would a simple `$("div").height()` realllllly lead to performance issues if I didn't throttle it?
[03:05:23] <xec> adammcarth: maybe, but if you cache the selector and do $div.height() it's probably fine
[03:09:21] <Cork> well except height will trigger reflow if here is anything to update
[03:11:10] <xec> adammcarth: new answer looks promising
[03:14:58] <adammcarth> xec: Very nice!
[03:15:05] <adammcarth> xec: Are you going to be angry if I accept his and not yours hahaha?
[03:15:22] <adammcarth> I do kind of feel bad since you've been helping me from that start ;)
[03:15:22] <jaroslaw> xec: Hi again! Do you remember http://jsfiddle.net/t9QfR/1/ ? In my code (on site) alert - $("#ac").val("four").data("autocomplete") return undefined. But alert - $("#ac").val() work correct.
[03:25:44] <webchao> good day, once again i have understanding problems with jquery promises... i have an array of function calls returning promises, e.g. var promises = [model1.save(), model2.save(),..], and each .save() call returning a promise.
[03:26:25] <webchao> now when i do this in a function saveAllModels, and this function will: return $.when.apply($, promises);  the function will return a single promise after all promises have been resolved, correct?
[03:26:44] <webchao> so i could do saveAllModels().then(callback); ..?
[03:26:50] <dwarder> this is a broad general question applied to any programming language: if you have a list of persons and each one has an id, and i manipulate them by id, now i need to add a virtual person wich is dynamic and doesn't have an id, should i create a virtual textual id for it?
[03:29:51] <webchao> dwarder: are you using the Backbone model for that? it has a 'cid' to give a unique Id before the model has been created
[03:30:02] <amaroks> Quick way to convert a number like 765 to 760 (round or ceill) last digit ?
[03:30:33] <webchao> amaroks: divide through 10, then round, then multiply with 10
[03:30:58] <webchao> >> (756 / 10).round() * 10
[03:31:13] <webchao> eh
[03:31:38] <Cork> js>  print((756 / 10).round() * 10)
[03:31:43] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[03:31:50] <webchao> uh?
[03:32:13] <gvo> Math.round(756/10)*10
[03:32:13] <Cork> js>  print(Math.round(756 / 10) * 10)
[03:32:18] <b-ot> Cork: 760
[03:32:25] <webchao> ah, here we are
[03:36:44] <webchao> any help with my promises understanding problem..?
[03:40:23] <webchao> ah well, i will do some more reading/TIAS'ing
[03:43:16] <xec> adammcarth: sry was afk, i don't mind ;) i would accept it too
[03:44:08] <xec> jaroslaw: alert whatnow?
[03:47:38] <jaroslaw> xec: No problem) There is problem with version of JQ. In 1.10 version I must use data('uiAutocomplete') instead data('autocomplete')
[03:48:37] <xec> oh. i didn't know that

[04:36:26] <hurdos> Does anyone know how to check chain of ajax calls? I have some code with several ajax calls and I need check that all of them succ and then call last final callback
[04:37:16] <Cork> hurdos: use $.when()
[04:37:34] <Cork> give it the xhr handlers for the ajax calls
[04:37:40] <Cork> and then use .done() from it
[04:42:50] <hurdos> I use some unifying function 'create()' where is calling several .ajax() request. If I would used one ajax req, then I could make something like that 'create(){return .ajax()}; create().done(callback);'
[04:43:43] <hurdos> Cork: but I do not understand how to make for chain of ajax reqs :(
[04:44:30] <Cork> do you need to wait for the responses from the earlier call before making the next one?
[04:44:36] <hurdos> Cork: something like 'create(){return .when(.ajax(), .ajax(), .ajax()) }; create().done(callback);' ?!
[04:44:41] <Cork> no
[04:44:56] <Cork> do you need to wait for the responses from the earlier call before making the next one? <..
[04:45:17] <Cork> also is the ajax calls number unknown?
[04:45:34] <Cork> meaning is the number of calls you need to make dynamic?
[04:46:18] <hurdos> Cork: I need wait all data from all ajax reqs that to rendering html block and then show it
[04:46:39] <Cork> hurdos: that doesn't answer the question
[04:47:03] <Cork> is it ok if the order is request: 3, 5, 2, 4, 1?
[04:47:10] <Cork> or does it have to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[04:47:29] <hurdos> Cork: it does not matter
[04:47:42] <Cork> and the question about dynamic number of calls?
[04:48:36] <hurdos> Cork: it's important to get all of them to render html block. There is 3 calls
[04:48:46] <Cork> ok so the number is static
[04:48:50] <hurdos> yep
[04:49:25] <Cork> function a() { return $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax(), $.ajax()); } a().done(function() {});
[04:49:30] <Cork> would work then
[04:50:06] <Cork> hurdos: so just add the $ in your original suggestion and it would work
[04:50:23] <Cork> ugg, sorry i added 4 not 3 :/
[04:50:52] <hurdos> Cork: thanks, I will try
[04:50:59] <Cork> good luck
[04:53:07] <hurdos> Cork: Is it possible to add ajax reqs inconsistent?
[04:56:42] <hurdos> Cork: Something like that:
[04:56:42] <hurdos> function a() { return $.when(b(), c())  } a().done(function() {});
[04:56:42] <hurdos> function b() {return $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax());}
[04:56:42] <hurdos> function c() {return $.when($.ajax(), $.ajax());}
[04:56:53] <Justin_ZW> Hallo. So I have a question: When selecting elements (I.E: $("#id > .class") or whatever, can wildcards be used? Like $("#source.*") ?

[05:10:48] <cff> I'm trying to include jQuery in my project with <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js"></script> but what happens when I don't have internet connection? jQuery won't be loaded... How can I load a local jQuery when the one from CDN fails to load for whatever reason?
[05:10:51] <R1ck> hi. I have an order form that i'd like to be able to include on whatever website, sort of like the google maps you see on some websites. What would be the best way to achieve this? Right now I'm thinking of exposing a function with a single parameter "targetElement" and then do something like $(targetElement).append("<div>myorderformcontent</div>") but it this the way to go?
[05:12:20] <Cork> cff: there isn't really a good way to handle that
[05:12:35] <cff> Cork: :(
[05:12:41] <Cork> cff: you can check if jQuery is defined and if it isn't inject a script that loads it
[05:12:49] <Cork> but that would load it async
[05:12:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> cff: you could run soem java script after using the CDN to test if jquery has laoded
[05:13:01] <Cork> so .ready would fail if your unlucky
[05:14:40] <Justin_ZW> Can wildcards be used when selecting elements?
[05:14:45] <Cork> <script>if(!jQuery) { var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src="local-jquery.js" }</script>
[05:14:47] <Cork> opps
[05:15:15] <hippiestick> a bit dirty, but i use something like this:
[05:15:15] <hippiestick> <script>!window.jQuery && document.write(unescape('%3Cscript type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/jquery.min.js"%3E%3C/script%3E'))</script>
[05:15:24] <Cork> cff: this would load a fallback jquery async <script>if(!jQuery) { var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src='local-jquery.js'; document.head.appendChild(script); }</script>
[05:15:39] <Cork> but like i said before scripts that depends on jquery on load would fail
[05:16:29] <Cork> hippiestick: don't use .write
[05:16:47] <Cork> it is risky and can make the browser throw away what is in it
[05:16:55] <Cork> (in the page)
[05:17:51] <hippiestick> Cork, yeap, i've read about it, but i've tried this method on two browsers, with annd w/o HTTPS and worked fine.
[05:18:04] <Justin_ZW> Look, this is a simple yes or no question. Can you or can you not use regular expression style wildcards when searching for elements?
[05:18:39] <Cork> hippiestick: and so would document.createElement, but without that risk
[05:18:51] <Cork> Justin_ZW: you can't
[05:19:15] <Justin_ZW> Thank you.
[05:19:16] <Cork> Justin_ZW: selectors in jquery depends on querySelector
[05:19:24] <Cork> and it follows the rules of css
[05:19:42] <hippiestick> Cork, thanks for the suggestion, i'll try using yours
[05:20:19] <hippiestick> but we're thinking of throwing out CDN loaded scripts alltogether, since the finished app will use only HTTPS.
[05:20:48] <Cork> hippiestick: cross domain https is allowed
[05:21:47] <hippiestick> Cork, while it did work on firefox/iceweasel/tenfourfox, i did not work on Chrome and afaik IE10 too.
[05:21:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: you suck balls
[05:22:21] <hippiestick> Cork, Chrome straight up blocked Google's own CDN and loaded the fallback immediately
[05:22:50] <Cork> hippiestick: and your sure you load from https ?
[05:23:03] <Cork> cause it works fine for me
[05:23:29] <Cork> up until just a few versions ago firefox loaded http in https without really complaining
[05:23:57] <sasmit87> I have one input element like <input name="myName[]" type="text" />,   what will be the jquery selector for this element ??
[05:24:14] <hippiestick> actually, yeah, i have to check if i haven't left it at http
[05:24:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> sasmit87: you want to selct the name
[05:24:55] <Cork> hippiestick: a simple way around that problem is to load from // instead of <protocol>://
[05:24:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> so something like
[05:25:02] <sasmit87> select by name
[05:25:07] <Cork> then it will always be the same protocol as the rest of the apge
[05:25:15] <Cork> *page
[05:25:43] <hippiestick> Cork, thanks, i'll try that today
[05:25:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("input[name='myName']")
[05:26:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> unless you give it an id sasmit87
[05:26:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: hey
[05:26:18] <sasmit87> myName has  square bracket []
[05:26:33] <sasmit87> so you cant do  $("input[name='myName']")
[05:26:47] <Cork> sasmit87: $('[name="myName[]"]')
[05:26:57] <sasmit87> not working
[05:27:00] <Cork> try
[05:27:39] <sasmit87> It gives syntax error
[05:27:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4KeY9/
[05:28:00] <sasmit87> Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [name=course[]]
[05:28:12] <Cork> you removed parts of the code i gave you
[05:28:45] <Cork> sasmit87: always quote attribute values in the selectors
[05:28:59] <sasmit87> ohhh...got it
[05:29:10] <sasmit87> missing double quotes
[05:29:27] <Anes> dears problem in fancy box

[05:41:19] <Dunstkreis> Does anybody know if there is a jquery plugin for eclipse?
[05:41:46] <Cork> Dunstkreis: there is support for it in modern browsers (though css)
[05:42:32] <Dunstkreis> Browser? Cork ? Eclipse is an IDE, :) i need autocompletion and stuff ...
[05:42:38] <Cork> ah
[05:42:55] <Cork> sorry though you meant the ... for overflowed text :)
[05:43:48] <Dunstkreis> ah, nope, but ty :) i am starting to code for a new project at university and try to teach jQuery to some beginners and autocompletion would be totaly awesome
[05:43:58] <Cork> http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/jsdt-jquery ?
[05:44:23] <Dunstkreis> yeah, already found it, but its jQuery 1.6.0 ......
[05:44:25] <Dunstkreis> :D
[05:44:34] <Cork> haven't used eclipse for ages
[05:44:53] <Cork> well except for android apps that is
[05:45:05] <Dunstkreis> for ages? :) what are u using?
[05:45:18] <Cork> nowdays i use sublime
[05:45:29] <Cork> ?g sublime text
[05:45:30] <b-ot> Cork: Sublime Text: The text editor you'll fall in love with â http://www.sublimetext.com/
[05:45:35] <Dunstkreis> well i am not into eclipse, but at work we use this IBM stuff so they use RSA and so i am familliar with eclipse...
[05:47:50] <Dunstkreis> ty cork looks good, ill give it a try
[05:48:10] <Cork> Dunstkreis: careful ;)
[05:48:16] <Cork> it is easy to get hooked ^^

[05:48:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: stop playing video games in class
[05:48:50] <Cork> o/
[05:49:07] <edudx> what is the regex to replace semi-colon and space "; "  to just semi-colon ";"  ?
[05:49:20] <edudx> I used     replace(new RegExp('[ ;]','gi'), ';');
[05:50:18] <Cork> edudx: why regex?
[05:50:18] <Cork> just do replace(': ', ';')
[05:51:04] <Cork> edudx: or do you mean to replace semicolon or space with semicolon?
[05:53:44] <edudx> Cork  semi-colon + space    like this   'some word; other word'  =  'some word;other word'
[05:54:13] <Cork> js> print('some word; other word'.replace('; ', ';')
[05:54:16] <Cork> js> print('some word; other word'.replace('; ', ';'))
[05:54:19] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:54:24] <b-ot> Cork: some word;other word

[06:02:54] <And1> Maybe anyone of you could help me with this javascript problem... Thanks! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19971634/load-native-htmlimport-when-clicking-a-link-a-onclick-and-output-to-index
[06:05:26] <R1ck> And1: that doesn't seem to involve jquery
[06:06:08] <And1> R1ck: That's right. Though I'm sure many of you know javascript. : x
[06:08:45] <Cork> And1: ##javascript
[06:09:52] <And1> Cork: Thanks.
[06:12:45] <Forbidd3n> anyway to do a find( href =?
[06:13:05] <Cork> .find('[href=""]')
[06:14:04] <Cork> if you are going to find by dynamic data i would recommend using filter
[06:14:26] <Cork> .find('[href]').filter(function() { return this.href == value_to_check; })
[06:14:39] <Cork> that way you don't have to care about escaping strings and things like that
[06:15:21] <VictorCL> so I am building an app with phonegap and jquery mobile , should I use xml or json to load the contents ??
[06:15:21] <VictorCL> which one would you recommend?
[06:15:54] <Cork> if the data you need can be mapped in json then use that
[06:16:00] <Cork> xml is normally over complicated
[06:16:13] <Cork> and you rarely need the extra complexity
[06:19:30] <VictorCL> cork if it is for jquery mobile and I have 30 items on this json file .. and the file weights 500k for example , can that affect the performance of my app?
[06:20:24] <Cork> that depends more on the device then anything else
[06:20:33] <Cork> especially how much ram it has
[06:20:55] <Cork> doesn't sounds too bad
[06:21:00] <VictorCL> ok
[06:21:04] <Cork> but you might want to watch out for it
[06:21:19] <Cork> and xml would be worse then json in the effect on the system
[06:21:25] <VictorCL> ok thanks
[06:21:30] <Cork> cause it is so much more complex to parse
[06:21:35] <Cork> (and walk)
[06:22:28] <doug65536> I'm using long polling to wait for an event on the server. My long poll is supposed to be 2 minutes. in chrome debugger, the timeline says that it was "waiting" for 2 minutes as expected. does anyone know why the "time" column always says 6 minutes?
[06:23:33] <doug65536> sending and receiving time are both zero in the timeline
[06:27:28] <Forbidd3n> Cork: why would this return 3 items when there is only one -- .filter(function() { return this.href.toLowerCase().indexOf('/customer') >= 0; })
[06:28:05] <Cork> Forbidd3n: did you have the find before it?
[06:28:13] <Forbidd3n> yeah
[06:28:18] <Forbidd3n> sorry forgot to paste that here
[06:28:27] <Forbidd3n> it finds it, just finds 2 other elements not related
[06:28:54] <Cork> filter just filters the current selection set
[06:28:58] <Cork> it doesn't find elements
[06:29:14] <Forbidd3n> how would I find the element that contains /customer
[06:29:23] <Forbidd3n> that is my end result I am trying to get
[06:29:25] <Cork> in the href?
[06:29:28] <Forbidd3n> yeah
[06:29:47] <Cork> .find('[href^="/customer"]')
[06:29:52] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[06:30:03] <Cork> if it starts with /customer that is
[06:30:09] <Cork> *= if it is anywhere in it
[06:30:09] <doug65536> cork you mean *= I think
[06:30:14] <Cork> doug65536: no
[06:30:27] <doug65536> Cork: does his filter say == 0? no, it doesn't
[06:30:42] <krambiorix> hi, i get an error "Too much recursion" on the first line.... http://pastebin.com/rgLTbbJK
[06:30:51] <Forbidd3n> doug65536: your correct
[06:30:53] <krambiorix> sorry, the third line
[06:30:57] <Forbidd3n> *= wordks
[06:30:59] <Forbidd3n> works
[06:31:28] <doug65536> cork was probably assuming that you are using relative paths, which is probably a good idea
[06:31:42] <Cork> krambiorix: that line can't really cause recursion
[06:32:03] <Cork> doug65536: it's absolute actually :)
[06:32:09] <Cork> relative doesn't start with /
[06:32:15] <doug65536> yeah, I meant, relative to the domain
[06:32:25] <Cork> that is absolute
[06:32:47] <Cork> full, absolute and relative
[06:34:10] <krambiorix> Cork, this line causes the recursion (firebug telle me) $(document).on('click', '.select', function() {
[06:34:32] <Cork> krambiorix: that just bind an event listener
[06:34:53] <Cork> krambiorix: if you get recursion there it is cause of some plugin or similar
[06:37:06] <Forbidd3n> Cork, doug65536: thanks
[06:41:09] <krambiorix> Cork, maybe because the script is in a separate file?
[06:41:16] <Cork> no
[06:41:23] <Cork> that has nothing to do with it
[06:41:45] <krambiorix> Cork, when i remove the listener, no error...
[06:41:59] <Cork> krambiorix: if the event from $(document).on('click', '.select', is fired multiple times it is cause something is triggering click on the element from that event listener
[06:43:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: is that some sort of nickname....its an interesting choice
[06:43:58] <krambiorix> Cork, i found it...apparently i can't use the function name 'init' ...
[06:44:09] <krambiorix> lol
[06:44:22] <Cork> krambiorix: ha, ya some helper widgets use that
[06:44:38] <xinming> Anyone here knows what is the best way to exclude some fields under a root?
[06:44:39] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks anywaysç
[06:44:41] <krambiorix> !
[06:45:01] <Cork> xinming: "fields"?
[06:45:05] <Cork> krambiorix: yw
[06:45:33] <xinming> <section> <div><a blaba>...</a></div> <div><textarea>...</textarea></div>  <div><a blabal>...</a></div   </section>    <-- In this case, How do we select all 'a' elemeents under <section> but exclude the fields under textarea element?
[06:45:57] <krambiorix> Cork, another question, i use that listener so i don't have to rebind it to the .select elements... But when my table has been rebuild, the listener isn't executed
[06:46:22] <xinming> It's used to exclude some nodes from the selector
[06:46:32] <Cork> krambiorix: again, shouldn't happen :)
[06:46:48] <Cork> krambiorix: the event listener is on the document, so as long as the class exist on the element, it should work
[06:47:09] <Cork> krambiorix: also you might want to add the listener on the outer most element of your widget instead of on document
[06:47:20] <Cork> makes it easier to not conflict with other scripts
[06:47:58] <Cork> xinming: under do you mean siblings after it?
[06:48:13] <doug65536> what's a good way to do what .text(str) does, but make the spaces &nbsp; -- maybe I'm solving it in the wrong place and it should .text a span that has css white-space: nowrap ?
[06:48:46] <xinming> Cork: Not sibling.
[06:48:48] <Cork> doug65536: or pre-wrap
[06:49:00] <Cork> xinming: textarea doens't have elements inside it
[06:49:04] <Cork> that is just text
[06:49:26] <xinming> I just want to prevent selection from certain nodes from some root element
[06:49:27] <doug65536> Cork: you mean, <pre> ?
[06:49:39] <Cork> doug65536: white-space: pre-wrap;
[06:49:47] <Cork> ?mdn white-space @ doug65536
[06:49:47] <b-ot> doug65536: Sorry, no results for âdeveloper.mozilla.org white-space @ doug65536â.
[06:49:52] <Cork> gah...
[06:49:54] <Cork> ?mdn white-space

[06:50:23] <doug65536> Cork: thanks
[06:50:27] <Cork> np
[06:53:17] <ph88> how can i make ... if el = button then el         or else search parent tree until button then parent  ?
[06:54:59] <Cork> then parent?
[06:55:21] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[06:58:39] <krambiorix> Cork, what i see is that when i click the checkbox, the listener on the checkbox is performed 2 times
[06:59:16] <Cork> krambiorix: do you use the widget more then once on the page?
[07:02:39] <krambiorix> Cork, yes :s
[07:03:03] <Cork> krambiorix: so do $(outer_most_widget_element).on('click', ... instead
[07:03:06] <Cork> and it should fix it
[07:04:15] <krambiorix> Cork, yes it did
[07:04:19] <krambiorix> thanks again!

[07:05:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got a question
[07:05:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> why is irc so awesome
[07:06:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: hey
[07:06:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> got the button fully working
[07:06:14] <Velveeta> yassir
[07:06:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont know if i showed you
[07:06:27] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: cause it has almost been around for as long as the net has :)
[07:06:38] <Velveeta> you showed me some pretty good progress last night, all i mentioned was that you needed a mouse/touchleave listener, and a mouse/touchmove listener
[07:07:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: its just so amazing, yet people forget what it is and has done. Honestly its the best way to get support for stuff
[07:07:04] <Velveeta> irc is awesome because it's full of geeksâ¦ and that's my peoplez
[07:07:16] <Cork> Rohan_Bhangui: i agree
[07:07:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i noticed that on ios7
[07:07:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> they have something similar for touch
[07:07:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: agreed
[07:07:42] <Velveeta> something similar to what?
[07:07:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[07:07:55] <Velveeta> it's also full of pervs btw
[07:07:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> the touch equivilent of mouseleave
[07:07:59] <Velveeta> but that's also kinda my peoplez
[07:08:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> applies
[07:08:05] <Velveeta> ahhh gotcha
[07:08:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[07:08:37] <Velveeta> i think the overwhelming population of irc can be summed up as technology and sex
[07:08:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: like my gen pretty much has no idea what irc is, i have to explain to them thats its pretty much the precursor to msn and everyhting else chat
[07:08:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: lol
[07:08:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the occasion image war
[07:09:14] <Velveeta> irc's slogan should be "here there be neckbeards"
[07:10:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[07:11:15] <Serdar> hello
[07:11:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i have to figure out how to do touch leave
[07:11:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Serdar: hello
[07:12:17] <Velveeta> actually, now that i think about it
[07:12:32] <Serdar> I tried using jquery to add some tr/td to the dom, but it looks overkill to me, can anybody tell me, if there is a better way?
[07:12:35] <Serdar> http://pastebin.com/XvD7NyEq
[07:12:35] <Velveeta> touchleave may not be implemented simply because when you touch-drag, it typically scrolls the page
[07:12:40] <Velveeta> your element with it
[07:12:53] <Velveeta> as opposed to your finger sliding freely across elements like a mouse can
[07:13:17] <Velveeta> serdar: thats definitely overkill :)
[07:13:34] <Velveeta> a lot of that can be simplified by just removing your document.createElement wrappers
[07:13:42] <Velveeta> .append('tr') is perfectly valid
[07:14:10] <Serdar> I use it because of this here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/268490/jquery-document-createelement-equivalent
[07:14:12] <Velveeta> additionally, if you know you have a certain set of markup you're wanting to inject, you don't have to create it all piecemeal
[07:14:23] <Serdar> createElement is four times faster
[07:15:02] <Velveeta> but you're nitpicking on performance where most browsers will blow those numbers away
[07:15:11] <Serdar> I want use this to add to append it to tablesort (jquery plugin) table
[07:15:26] <Velveeta> chrome is already into the 30's for version, and jquery is up to 1.11 i think, and 2.1 or something
[07:15:53] <Serdar> hmm
[07:15:54] <Velveeta> performance has definitely improved since those days, and if you're going to use document.createElement, you might as well also use .appendChild instead of jquery's .append method
[07:16:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> guys is there a touch equivilent to mouseleave and mouse enter
[07:16:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> i tried using blue but it didnt work
[07:16:37] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: read what i just said a page or 2 above about touchleave
[07:16:58] <Velveeta> serdar: code like that is micro-optimizing for generally no noticable performance increase
[07:17:18] <Velveeta> and what you may gain in performance you lose in readability/maintainability
[07:17:28] <Velveeta> because when someone comes back to that code a year from now, they're gonna be like :O
[07:17:32] <Serdar> yeah that's true
[07:18:23] <Velveeta> for complex insertions like that, you can just create 1 chain of html markup and inject it all at once, like: '<tr><td>' + someProperty + '</td></tr><tr><td>some other stuff</td></tr>' etc
[07:18:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: no luck
[07:18:33] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: no luck what?
[07:18:48] <Serdar> before my change it was like this: http://pastebin.com/RqRWVVD1
[07:19:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> preventing toggle when i lave the toggle switch area
[07:19:38] <Serdar> this is more readable, but I couldn't add it to tablesort
[07:19:43] <odium> I know I asked my question poorly, but I can't seem to properly define or call a function. http://pastebin.com/QCrRqVNf
[07:19:56] <Mic123> Hi guys, if i want to append many input elements. Is $('<input>') a DOM Operation? Cause it seems to work a little bit slow. Is it faster to create the input elements as strings?
[07:20:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> Mic123: why not use $("input")   ?
[07:20:24] <Velveeta> serdar: you should also look into some client-side templating libraries like handlebarsâ¦ it allows you to have nice, clean, readable markup, stored as a js template, and you just feed it your data to crunch out html for insertion, it's nice and snappy, as well as aiding in readability
[07:21:12] <Velveeta> odium: try wrapping body in quotes, it's a tag, not a variable reference like window
[07:21:27] <Velveeta> your function itself looks like it's defined properly
[07:21:38] <Serdar> Velveeta, my problem is simplier, I am looking for a way to add/remove some rows in a table which is sorted (so I don't need to sort)
[07:22:14] <Serdar> what I found is tablesort2 which looks fine but what I do is also overkill, I rebuild the complete table if a new row is inserted
[07:22:36] <Velveeta> mic123: $('<input>') is technically a dom operation, as it creates an element out of that markupâ¦ i'm not sure what you mean in the 2nd half of that question
[07:22:55] <odium> ktnx, velveeta
[07:23:01] <Velveeta> odium: no problem
[07:23:34] <Velveeta> serdar: i'm not familiar w/ either tablesort or tablesort2, but nevertheless, a templating language would still help clean up your markup compilation and make it easy to inject new content
[07:23:49] <Velveeta> it also allows you to split out your templates as various reusable ui components more easily
[07:24:36] <Serdar> give me some keywords, I don't understand, what you mean with templates in combination with js
[07:24:36] <Mic123> I want to append many input elements in a loop with name, value and type attribute. I used $('<input>') to create it and attr(...) to set this attributes. This seems to be a DOM Operation and slow.
[07:25:20] <Serdar> oh I see, wiki does know it
[07:27:20] <Velveeta> serdar: check out handlebars or mustache
[07:27:49] <Serdar> I found this http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/
[07:27:57] <Serdar> these two are listed there
[07:28:30] <Velveeta> mic123: so, you can either create it as one big html string and run it through the jquery constructor at the end to get all of the elements create, or you can do it like you're currently doing, but typically, best practice states you shouldn't be doing dom operations inside of a loop
[07:28:49] <Velveeta> whenever possible, you should be creating a string in your loop and doing the dom operations all at once outside of the loop
[07:29:20] <Mic123> Okay thanks i will give it a try.
[07:30:02] <Velveeta> serdar: nice, i haven't seen that site before
[07:30:23] <odium> velv... I tried your suggestion http://pastebin.com/T0Gx5NAE but it still doesn't work.
[07:30:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta:
[07:30:46] <Guest79126> hey guys, do you know a solution for this issue in jquerymobile 1.3.2? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9725196/jquery-mobile-and-textarea-rows
[07:31:07] <Guest79126> css only isn't working anymore.
[07:31:20] <Serdar> Velveeta, if I understand them correctly, then they are only working, if the structure does not change?
[07:31:20] <odium> Velveeta: http://pastebin.com/V0RgaK1w works though. I don't understand.
[07:31:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: its still not working trying to get the touch equivalent of mouselevae
[07:32:10] <Velveeta> odium: for one thing, you're referencing this.style.css within your plugin function, and referencing the jquery css function in the working example
[07:32:23] <Velveeta> have you checked your js console to see if any errors are being thrown?
[07:32:37] <odium> I'll do that now, sorry.
[07:35:42] <revolve> can someone tell me why the register link here is disappearing? http://psybernetics.org.uk:8080/#
[07:36:13] <Velveeta> what register link?
[07:36:17] <Velveeta> i keed, i keed!
[07:36:36] <revolve> yeah exactly though
[07:36:50] <revolve> the script that's doing it is in the page src
[07:36:52] <Velveeta> because this is the first line of your document.ready function? $(".register").hide();
[07:37:16] <revolve> right but that ought to be only hiding the div, right?
[07:37:28] <revolve> amirite
[07:37:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i think igot it
[07:37:31] <Velveeta> oh yeah good call
[07:37:37] <Velveeta> i didn't pay attention to the selector
[07:37:40] <Velveeta> rohan: nice :)
[07:37:57] <revolve> if it helps, what's going on is completely lifted from http://jsfiddle.net/Xafpf/
[07:38:11] <revolve> and it's bugging me that something so simple..doesn't work
[07:38:36] <Velveeta> oh, it's probably your toggle function call
[07:38:54] <revolve> ok what's wrong?
[07:39:34] <Velveeta> let me take a look at that fiddle's source for a minute
[07:39:54] <revolve> thank you
[07:40:11] <Velveeta> i'm not familiar w/ that that toggle format you're trying to call, w/ 2 function handlers, so let me see if the fiddle itself has a different version of toggle than you're running, since they also have jquery mobile and ui loaded in that page
[07:41:03] <ddssc> how do I hide an input field inside jq ui dialog? for some reason .hide() doesn't work
[07:41:05] <odium> velveeta, thank you that worked perfectly. see, http://odium.mooo.com:81/pup
[07:41:08] <Velveeta> hm, looks like it's using the speed/easing/callback version
[07:41:24] <krambiorix> i have anchors with classes "deleteItem disabled"   and only "deleteItem" .... I want to select all anchors with deleteItem and NOT disabled... How can i do that?   $(".deleteItem:not(.disabled)") doesn't do it...
[07:41:34] <Velveeta> odium: cuteness overload
[07:41:50] <revolve> Velveeta: can i do this with just the latest jquery?
[07:41:57] <Velveeta> ddssc: hide should work fine, but make sure your selector is matching properly
[07:42:02] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You sure?
[07:42:20] <joland9> anyone who knows how to do a open and close with .toggle using several <li> tags?
[07:42:27] <Velveeta> krambiorix: yeah that should work right
[07:42:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta:
[07:42:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> check with chrome touc emulator
[07:42:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> or on device
[07:42:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://themeforest.net16.net/
[07:43:04] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/egohUgOT/1/edit?html,js,output That works.
[07:43:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> its still a bit buggy but check on phoen if you dont mind
[07:43:39] <revolve> Velveeta: how can i do this with just the latest jquery?
[07:44:05] <revolve> a series of specifi hide/show, instead of toggle?
[07:44:06] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, Velveeta hmm weird
[07:44:08] <Velveeta> revolve: it looks like the method they're using is just the standard jquery version of the method vs an overridden one
[07:44:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what you think
[07:44:16] <Serdar> Velveeta, if I understood you correctly, than this is more jquery than before, right? http://pastebin.com/xynvJ7Rk
[07:44:28] <Velveeta> revolve: plus, i'm not exactly sure what you're trying to do, so i can't answer that without details
[07:45:13] <revolve> Velveeta: I'm trying to have the register div hidden on page load, and displayed once the "Register" anchor is clicked
[07:45:19] <Velveeta> serdar: yes, but i gave you the wrong syntax, those tags should be wrapped in angle brackets
[07:45:26] <revolve> and ideally, toggled into hiding if the register anchor is pressed again
[07:45:48] <Velveeta> serdar: and you can combine a lot of that into a single line or a handful of lines, they don't all need to be separated out like that
[07:46:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: its super buggy
[07:46:10] <Velveeta> revolve: if you can put your example into a jsfiddle, i can try to show you how to do that
[07:46:19] <revolve> cheers
[07:46:41] <Velveeta> rohan: i'm about to get crackalackin on my workday, so i can't look into that too much right now
[07:47:18] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Same result if you do $('.deleteItem').not('.disabled') ?
[07:47:25] <ph88> Cork: i have a button with an image ... when i click around the image i get the button as element, but when i click the image i get the image as element ... but i always want to grab the button
[07:47:38] <Serdar> Velveeta, do you mean somethign like this .append($('tr td')...
[07:48:04] <Velveeta> serdar: like this.. $('<tr><td>sldkfj</td></tr>')
[07:48:12] <Velveeta> you need angle brackets on that markup to have jquery create it
[07:48:28] <Velveeta> otherwise you're making it a selector vs a create
[07:49:13] <Serdar> than I don't need a append?
[07:49:13] <revolve> Velveeta: I'm using 1.10.2 on the site; http://jsfiddle.net/8H7Fh/
[07:49:38] <Velveeta> serdar: well you do need append, yes, but the create syntax is what i was pointing out
[07:50:40] <revolve> Velveeta: ideally i'd just like a register link to be displayed on page load without the register div, and have the link toggle the div in and out
[07:50:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i just needyou to quickly test for any bugginess
[07:50:55] <Velveeta> gotcha
[07:51:03] <Serdar> Velveeta, isn't this what you mean? http://pastebin.com/rVwDb0Ev
[07:51:22] <Velveeta> serdar: yes, that would work fine
[07:51:51] <Serdar> Velveeta, and what I get is a dom object which I can append somewhere in the table right?
[07:52:09] <Velveeta> yepyep
[07:52:31] <Serdar> I see, hell JS is difficult sometimes
[07:52:37] <Guest79126> is it possible to set a textarea to one row in jquerymobile 1.3.2? by default, the textarea will grow up automaticly to 2 rows.
[07:53:41] <revolve> Velveeta: have you found a solution for this? I'd be pretty grateful
[07:54:00] <revolve> really just wanna get back to work on the backend
[07:56:15] <Velveeta> revolve: ok, i found yer problem <wiping grease off his face>
[07:56:21] <revolve> :O !!
[07:56:30] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/8H7Fh/2/
[07:56:54] * revolve paypals Velveeta a brazillian dollars
[07:56:56] <revolve> thank you sir
[07:56:59] <Velveeta> when you show that element, and then call toggle with those 2 functions, you're basically saying "if this is shown, hide it with this function, if this is hidden, show it with this function"
[07:57:04] <revolve> i will tell my grandchildren of your kindness
[07:57:14] <Velveeta> so since you already have it shown, when it hits that toggle call, it hides it with the supplied function
[07:57:30] <Velveeta> make sure to tell them how i drove my enemies before me, and heard the lamentations of their women
[07:57:41] <revolve> sound
[07:57:46] <revolve> and thank you
[07:57:49] <Velveeta> ok rohan, i'll take a quick look at this, and then i gots ta get to work :)
[07:57:52] <Velveeta> revolve: you're welcome :)
[07:58:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i think it has a few bugs but i am limited by touch library
[07:58:26] <Velveeta> is this your own project or something for your job?
[07:59:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> elts leave as own project for now
[07:59:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> but to give you whole picture
[07:59:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> it is apart of something bigger
[07:59:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i could have used someone elses code
[07:59:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i wnt to get to as close to native as possible
[07:59:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> (just to iterate the touch library is not mine)
[07:59:59] <revolve> Velveeta: the register link doesnt work
[08:00:00] <Velveeta> gotcha
[08:00:05] <TheEternalAbyss> greetings... I had a quick question.. well hopefully it is indeed quick. Essentially I'm trying to make a page load more quickly by removing redudant includes/linking to library files such as jquery ui tabs. Now I have and index file that loads all the libraries I need, then and several php files that are loaded through the index, via ajax calls. The wall I've run into is as follows: everything seems to just stop mid load. N
[08:00:18] <Velveeta> revolve: well yeah, that's a different problem :D i was just telling you how to get it showing ;)
[08:00:27] <TheEternalAbyss> so my tabs don't...tab :\
[08:00:30] <Velveeta> you don't have anything bound up to it as a click listener
[08:01:03] <Velveeta> rohan: i only see 1 bug, and that's when i click and mouse down and away off the button and release, then mouse back over, then off and on again, it goes into active mode
[08:01:08] <revolve> man, can you get this working a min before you go?
[08:01:15] <Velveeta> not the first time i mouse back onto it, but the 2nd and everytime thereafter
[08:01:16] <revolve> http://jsfiddle.net/8H7Fh/2/ please
[08:01:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: test with touch enabled
[08:01:26] <Velveeta> rohan: that is with touch enabled
[08:01:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya i cant fix it
[08:01:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> the closest i can get to actaul thing
[08:01:41] <revolve> just this once then i'll learn js from the ground up
[08:01:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> is just as long as you hold it and when you release it activates
[08:02:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> im so close
[08:02:02] <Velveeta> but that shouldn't be an issue, like i said half an hour ago, because when you touch and mouse down on a mobile device, that's typically a scroll operation
[08:02:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> damn
[08:02:18] <joland9> hi all! Does anyone who knows how to do a open and close with .toggle using several <li> tags?
[08:02:32] <TheEternalAbyss> I guess my question is, is this something you all have heard of before?
[08:02:37] <Velveeta> the only thing i can think of to force it would be to make the button aware of its exact location w/ x/y and height/width, and then add a touchdrag listener that checks its x/y coordinates against that rectangle
[08:02:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i fucking got it
[08:03:19] <Velveeta> yeah?
[08:03:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay try the link
[08:03:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> thhttp://themeforest.net16.net/
[08:03:39] <revolve> Velveeta: how do i add onclick handlers? what ones should i be adding?
[08:03:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://themeforest.net16.net/
[08:03:41] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss: not anything i've heard of before, sounds like there's a js error being thrown somewhere that's killing the rest of your ajax loads to process
[08:04:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> revolve: $(selector).on("click"......
[08:04:04] <Velveeta> revolve: you need a click handler on your link that fires what you currently have as a toggle function i think
[08:04:11] <TheEternalAbyss> Velveeta: yea but no error message is given to me
[08:04:13] <revolve> cheers :)
[08:04:20] <Serdar> can anybody help me with tablesorter2 plugin?
[08:04:30] <Velveeta> rohan: that's more broken on my end
[08:04:45] <Velveeta> now the active class stays stuck when i drag down and away
[08:04:48] <TheEternalAbyss> Rohan_Bhangui: not even loading for me
[08:04:55] <joland9> hi all! Does anyone who knows how to do a open and close with .toggle using several <li> tags?
[08:04:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait a bit
[08:05:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: wait a bit it takes some time
[08:05:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> tops 5d
[08:05:13] <TheEternalAbyss> ah ok
[08:05:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> *5sec
[08:05:31] <TheEternalAbyss> need a loading or prgress bar dude
[08:05:35] <TheEternalAbyss> XD
[08:06:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> refresh
[08:06:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: its  a subdomain and it inserts its own stat counter script
[08:06:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> which is cumbersome
[08:06:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> try now
[08:06:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> finally i got it!!!
[08:07:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> its perfect im gonna cry ;)
[08:07:07] <TheEternalAbyss> is there any tool out there that can let me run a page line by line?
[08:07:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> :,)
[08:07:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> run a page line by line?
[08:07:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you mean
[08:07:28] <TheEternalAbyss> you've never used a compiler?
[08:07:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have
[08:07:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh i c what you mean
[08:07:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[08:07:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> you could
[08:07:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> load the file using a reader
[08:07:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then red line by line
[08:08:01] <Velveeta> revolve: try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8H7Fh/4/
[08:08:04] <TheEternalAbyss> a reader..?
[08:08:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dunno about jquery
[08:08:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> but in php
[08:08:16] <TheEternalAbyss> your page timeoout by the way
[08:08:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can read a page line by line
[08:08:21] <TheEternalAbyss> timed out*

[08:09:13] <revolve> Velveeta: that's perfect

[08:09:23] <Velveeta> no problem
[08:09:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> revolve: end your inputs with a \
[08:10:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: how my thing look (i knwo your gonna be busy soon)
[08:10:23] <TheEternalAbyss> still no load
[08:11:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[08:11:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> in your console a stat counter should load
[08:11:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> after that try
[08:11:23] <Velveeta> rohan: it's more broken for me
[08:11:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry
[08:11:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[08:11:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> chrome touc hemulated right?
[08:11:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> *touch emulated
[08:11:39] <Velveeta> yes
[08:11:41] <TheEternalAbyss> console says console.api has been disabled
[08:11:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[08:12:05] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm on ff anyways
[08:12:08] <TheEternalAbyss> this a chrome specific thing?
[08:12:13] <Velveeta> when i mousedown and hold and drag down off the element, the active class stays stuck, and when i go back to it the first time and click on it, nothing happens the first time, it takes a 2nd click to make it slide over
[08:12:48] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm done in here for a while, i have stuff i have to get to, been at my desk for over and hour and have yet to write a line of code for myself, or finish merging branches around that i started last night :D
[08:12:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: well yeah
[08:13:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: https://secure.join.me/988-969-072
[08:13:25] <TheEternalAbyss> oh i don't use chrome... only have it for dev purposes
[08:13:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya well this thing is bound for mobile so
[08:13:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me show you how it works on my screen
[08:13:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> joi nthat link
[08:14:09] <TheEternalAbyss> and you do realize many mobile devices don't use chrome/webkit, right?
[08:14:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> like?
[08:14:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> well this is targeted for android and ios platforms
[08:14:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> its bound for a hybrid app
[08:14:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[08:14:53] <TheEternalAbyss> that's an odd way of going about it
[08:14:56] <TheEternalAbyss> imho
[08:15:14] <TheEternalAbyss> I'd rather html5 an app, making it truly crossplatform
[08:15:16] <Velveeta> well, to deploy it as a legitimate app without going the native route, that's a perfectly normal way of doing it
[08:15:32] <Velveeta> if he wants to make it available through an app store
[08:15:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[08:15:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> im using phonegap and steroidsjs
[08:16:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> html wrapped in native wrapper
[08:16:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> with access to device apis
[08:16:13] <TheEternalAbyss> he still could make it available on app stores as long as the guidelines are followed
[08:16:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> well yes
[08:16:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have read articles on this srot of stuff
[08:16:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> about not being "app" enough
[08:17:31] <TheEternalAbyss> plus android dev is broken by  nature as there is no way to predict how an app will behave on EVERY device out there since there's so much saturation in droid versions and custom flavors of phone makers (samsung is particularly guilty of this)
[08:17:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> well
[08:17:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> here is my target
[08:17:54] <TheEternalAbyss> chrome says it can't connect
[08:18:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> android version 4.X
[08:18:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> and ios
[08:18:31] <TheEternalAbyss> by the way, thanks for the invite to see what you're doing, but i'm at work, I can't join up
[08:18:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh np
[08:18:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> it works fine on mine

[08:25:35] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: I got the transition working
[08:25:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: nice
[08:26:00] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: For some reason it doesn't work with the display, it works if I use visibility
[08:26:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: this is Pingu my good friend and a web devloper in the making
[08:26:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: interesting
[08:26:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: try with opactiy
[08:26:33] <Velveeta> hello pingu his good friend and a web devloper in the making

[08:26:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> :)
[08:26:42] <TheEternalAbyss> around what time?
[08:26:50] <Pingu> I did it with opacity and visibility
[08:26:54] <Pingu> Works great
[08:27:05] <Velveeta> theeternalabyss: probably arouuuuuund 8-9pm central time?
[08:27:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> find my name

[08:32:41] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: I would but I have food already lol
[08:32:44] <TheEternalAbyss> i would, but I'm kind of done with idling/hanging out regularly in irc chat rooms
[08:32:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: damn
[08:33:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: im hungry lol
[08:33:17] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: Maybe another time dude
[08:33:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: i dont idle either i have stuff to work on, its just good to get an occasional laugh
[08:33:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: sure
[08:33:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: well why dont you join me in food court anyways
[08:33:47] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: What kind of transition is used in the original page dude? it looks nice but I can't seem to find it ;o
[08:34:01] <Pingu> Rohan_Bhangui: the dropdown effect
[08:34:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Pingu: ill give you a hint - it moves and fades in
[08:34:14] <TheEternalAbyss> Rohan_Bhangui: well I did the hanging out and even being an Op for a chan and it ended in disaster
[08:34:30] <TheEternalAbyss> Pingu can tell you about it, he knows
[08:34:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> TheEternalAbyss: not asking you to dedicate yourself to #jquery, just hangout with us thats all
[08:34:52] <TheEternalAbyss> when I'm here I'll hang
[08:34:57] <TheEternalAbyss> bu I have to go to lunch

[08:38:55] <Pingu> And let you know
[08:39:28] <totophe> Hi all
[08:40:01] <totophe> Does someone knows if it is possible to reload jqueryui on a same page?
[08:40:14] <totophe> I know it seems weird
[08:45:06] <sifu> hey guys was wondering why this error would happen http://d.pr/i/jcWm (possibly misplacing the jquery order??)
[08:50:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> sifu: you sure your loading jquery before the script
[08:50:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> and second use jsfiddle to post code
[08:51:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and 3rd try $ instead of 'jQuery'
[08:52:18] <sifu> loading jQuery before the script? isn't that what I am supposed to do as it uses jQuery as well? Will try to create a fiddle. Have to use jQuery because if i use $ it conflicts with mootools
[08:53:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay
[08:53:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> createing aifddle makes it easier for other to fix as well
[08:54:11] <sifu> Rohan_Bhangui yep i get ya...just finding it hard as to what to fiddle here as i still have not figures out what is triggering it
[08:54:44] <zim> Hi all. I am building an inline edit. And have a few questions please have a look here. http://jsfiddle.net/VcbM3/
[08:54:58] <doug65536> is there any risk of a problem if you update an object's values in a $.each?
[08:55:41] <doug65536> as in: var x = { a: null, b: null }; $.each(x, function(k,v) { x[k] = $('div[data-foo=' + k'); })
[08:57:00] <zim> doug65536: Wow thats over my head please edit the paste with an example.
[08:58:17] <doug65536> zim: what are the .data calls for? you don't appear to use it
[08:58:38] <zim> doug65536: will do I know how to do that
[08:59:20] <zim> doug65536: they will be posted back with the value to the back end
[09:00:03] <doug65536> zim: fixed possible problems with escapes http://jsfiddle.net/VcbM3/3/
[09:00:12] <doug65536> and focused it when editing starts
[09:01:22] <Venko> Does anyone know of a JQuery library that adds placeholder support for IE?
[09:01:32] <doug65536> zim: for example, if there is an & in the text, your code would screw up, my fiddle won't
[09:02:03] <zim> doug65536: TY
[09:02:05] <Venko> Someone gave me one :)
[09:02:53] <doug65536> Venko: yes, the solution to all IE problems is, don't use IE :D
[09:03:03] <num_youknow> Given that .html() or .text() don't work for xml documents, how do I replace xml content from the browser console?
[09:03:25] <Venko> doug65536: On my end, sure. Not on the end of clients stuck on locked-down enterprise machines.
[09:03:43] <doug65536> Venko: yeah, enterprises are bad for that aren't they
[09:04:02] <Venko> Indeed. My SME uses Firefox+Chrome but some of our customers use IE
[09:04:07] <tylerbre> quick question: I have array of two elements but each with unique classnames. How do I grab one by its classname from the array
[09:04:51] <doug65536> num_youknow: using blocks of raw html or xml in your case is not advisable anyway. use document fragments
[09:04:58] <tylerbre> [<div class="foo bar"></div>, <div class="foo baz"></div>]
[09:05:10] <tylerbre> how do I grab div.bar?
[09:05:39] <zim> doug65536: and in your example how would you shift the data-* to the new element?
[09:05:42] <tylerbre> probably a really simple answer that I over looked
[09:06:06] <doug65536> num_youknow: var y = $('<customer/>').attr('id', 123).append('<address/>').text('123 x street'); someParent.append(y);
[09:06:32] <doug65536> num_youknow: oops, typo. you get the idea though right?
[09:06:43] <NoiseEee> tylerbre: assuming your 'array' is really a jquery object of elements, http://jsfiddle.net/vU3fk/
[09:06:51] <tylerbre> NoiseEee: it is
[09:07:03] <num_youknow> doug65536 Ah, I think I do. Will try it out and get back :)
[09:07:27] <tylerbre> NoiseEee: ah, yep :)
[09:07:38] <doug65536> zim: magically copy over all of the data? I don't know a way to reliably do that. do you know what attributes you need to bring over?
[09:07:40] <tylerbre> it was something simeple
[09:07:42] <tylerbre> thanks
[09:07:45] <NoiseEee> np tylerbre
[09:08:05] <zim> doug65536: no
[09:08:40] <doug65536> zim: jquery documentation doesn't define what happens if you don't pass a parameter to .data right?
[09:09:15] <doug65536> zim: ah, nevermind... it does
[09:09:25] <doug65536> zim: 1 sec
[09:09:40] <zim> doug65536: I will hazard a guess in fiddle and you can see what I am after
[09:11:17] <doug65536> zim this should do it http://jsfiddle.net/VcbM3/5/
[09:12:28] <zim> doug65536: TY now tring to work out how it works :-)
[09:13:25] <doug65536> zim: $.each will go through all of the properties in the object in the first parameter, and call the function passed in the second parameter for each property, passing it the name and value of that property
[09:13:40] <zim> TY
[09:14:29] <doug65536> zim: that is a bit scary, it could have unintended effects for plugins. if you are reasonably sure that you won't have any problems with that, it's probably ok
[09:14:51] <doug65536> zim: plugins often stick stuff in .data
[09:15:05] <zim> doug65536:
[09:15:31] <zim> doug65536: hum yes.
[09:17:04] <doug65536> zim: ah, did you want to actually transfer the data- attributes, or the data. they aren't really the same thing
[09:18:05] <zim> I just need to be able to access the key pair values in the second function
[09:18:17] <doug65536> zim: .data('foo') will read the data-foo attribute value, but setting .data('bar', 'baz') won't create a data-bar attribute
[09:18:49] <doug65536> zim: and setting .data('foo', 123) won't change the attribute, it will change the data cached for that element
[09:18:56] <bnason_> Is there a way to pass arbitrary data to a $.then ?
[09:18:59] <zim> doug65536: hold on will add some stuff
[09:19:13] <doug65536> bnason_: a closure
[09:19:39] <bnason_> doug65536, im not sure how to use that here
[09:20:05] <doug65536> bnason_: make a function that has parameters for the arbitrary data, and make that return the then callback function. the callback will "see" the parameters
[09:20:24] <bnason_> hrm k lemmy try
[09:20:59] <bnason_> so in this function if I call another deferred, i just return that deferred in order to chain it more?
[09:21:04] <doug65536> bnason_: the 'then' callback might already have access to that arbitrary data
[09:22:12] <doug65536> bnason_: it depends, I am making large assumptions about the context of that code where it calls .then
[09:22:56] <bnason_> ok I got it it, essentially .then(function(jsondata) { return mycall(mypasseddata, jsondata); }).done(...);
[09:22:57] <bnason_> thanks!
[09:25:03] <frank_o> How'd one make this deferred.done() work for all the links and not just the first? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/U29X5/4/
[09:25:26] <frank_o> * and not just the first one clicked
[09:27:14] <doug65536> frank_o: not the most efficient way to attach the click handlers, but this does what you seem to want http://jsfiddle.net/U29X5/5/
[09:28:11] <frank_o> doug65536: hehe yeah that's true. click was probably not the best way to illustrate the problem. thanks a lot!
[09:28:58] <h4k1m> hi everybody
[09:29:14] <frank_o> doug65536: Seems I have to click the links some 5-10 times before the alert appears though
[09:29:15] <h4k1m> anyone knows a good physics engine written in js?
[09:31:32] <doug65536> frank_o: what? you understand how .when works right?
[09:31:45] <doug65536> it fires once you've clicked each link once
[09:31:56] <doug65536> you could click one like infinite times and it won't fire
[09:32:02] <doug65536> one link*
[09:32:40] <frank_o> Nice, but right now nothing happens when I click each link once. I have to click like 5-10 times on each for them to fire.
[09:33:07] <doug65536> frank_o: it works perfectly for me
[09:33:52] <frank_o> hmm thats odd
[09:34:10] <doug65536> frank_o: I tried in both chrome and FF
[09:34:34] <frank_o> me too just now
[09:35:47] <doug65536> frank_o: it's weird to pass undefined to .apply like that. in a real call to when, it would be $
[09:36:06] <frank_o> Can somebody else see if the alert appears once every first time you click each link at http://jsfiddle.net/U29X5/5/ ?
[09:36:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: ehy im back
[09:36:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi
[09:36:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey
[09:36:32] <doug65536> frank_o: try this one http://jsfiddle.net/U29X5/7/
[09:36:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: yes
[09:37:00] <frank_o> doug65536: nope
[09:37:08] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: really :S
[09:37:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> not every 3
[09:37:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> but forthe first 3
[09:37:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> what are you trying to accomplish
[09:37:28] <frank_o> yep
[09:37:33] <doug65536> frank_o: what you said is nonsense
[09:37:41] <frank_o> Rohan_Bhangui: well they won't fire for me
[09:37:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[09:37:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> what browser?
[09:37:57] <doug65536> Rohan_Bhangui: he's asking you to try that fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/U29X5/7/ and it should popup the alert once you have clicked each link AT LEAST ONCE
[09:38:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> im on chrome 32 beta
[09:38:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya it works
[09:38:40] <doug65536> meaning, click link 1 <nothing happens>, click link 3 <nothing happens>, click link 3 <nothing happens>, click link 2 <alert shows>
[09:38:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got popup only after clicking all the links
[09:38:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[09:38:51] <doug65536> thanks
[09:38:54] <frank_o> wait wait
[09:39:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: try console.log instead of alert
[09:39:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> and see what you get
[09:39:29] <frank_o> I think there's been a huge misunderstanding!
[09:39:48] <frank_o> doug65536: What you said there is exactly what happens. Was that the intention?
[09:40:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> frank_o: you tell us, its your issue
[09:40:24] <doug65536> frank_o: you must have the wrong idea about what deferred and when do
[09:40:37] <doug65536> frank_o: yes, what behavior do you want
[09:41:25] <frank_o> Basically that of a click handler. Click link 1 <alert shows>, click link 1 again <nothing happens>, click link 2 <alert shows, click link 3 <alert shows>
[09:41:44] <doug65536> frank_o: $.when means, make a deferred that is 'done' when all of the passed in deferred's are done
[09:42:22] <doug65536> frank_o: use .one
[09:42:47] <frank_o> Ooh all of them, I see
[09:42:57] <doug65536> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/CpE5H/1/
[09:45:57] <frank_o> doug65536: Is there a way to use deferred to achieve the same thing? My real case here is much more complex and I wouldn't want to bother you all with it.
[09:47:11] <zim> doug65536: Have updated so it works bur would love if you could see if you could make it better http://jsfiddle.net/VcbM3/6/
[09:50:18] <zim> doug65536: Thinking about your last Q I could always use a data-known='' like this http://jsfiddle.net/VcbM3/7/
[09:55:59] <doug65536> frank_o: it's hard to give a good answer if you are asking an XY question
[09:56:17] <doug65536> frank_o: use a deferred for each separate link?
[09:57:04] <doug65536> zim: that looks ok
[09:57:21] <doug65536> zim: update the server immediately after each edit? does it work?
[09:58:08] <zim> It fires all the necessaries Server site is my friend.
[09:58:26] <zim> doug65536: TY again

[10:02:51] <doug65536> frank_o: this is my guess for what you want http://jsfiddle.net/CpE5H/5/
[10:03:43] <doug65536> frank_o: or maybe this http://jsfiddle.net/CpE5H/6/
[10:04:40] <frank_o> doug65536: wow thats pretty nice :)
[10:06:12] <frank_o> was about to ask if maybe i needed to use variables which i incremented for each link to give unique names to new deferred objects
[10:06:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> doug65536: i dont get it
[10:06:44] <frank_o> but this.. wow thanks a lot man
[10:07:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> and once again #jquery getting it done
[10:07:18] <doug65536> Rohan_Bhangui: don't get what
[10:07:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> what was trying to be accomplished
[10:07:59] <doug65536> neither do I really so I just showed ways you could use deferred for clicks
[10:08:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> deferred meaning?
[10:08:37] <doug65536> $.Deferred
[10:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> but what does that ean
[10:08:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> to defer
[10:09:27] <doug65536> Rohan_Bhangui: it's an advanced part of jquery for implementing continuation style algorithms
[10:09:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> in english
[10:09:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry nto familiar with this branch
[10:09:46] <frank_o> to postpone basically, right?
[10:09:53] <doug65536> the best use of it is when you have a scenario where you want to wait for multiple async things to be finished, then do something
[10:09:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh until a condition is met
[10:10:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[10:10:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> but cant you quene
[10:10:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then push the last thing (whcih is the thing you want to do when finished) to the end of array of asyncs
[10:11:25] <doug65536> say you had an ajax request to get customer information and order information and user information, but for some reason you need to have all of the results in one place. you can do that easily and efficiently with deferred
[10:11:50] <doug65536> without deferred you might need to get one thing at a time, in each completion callback. with deferred you can do them all at once and handle it when they are all done
[10:13:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> kinda like threads, and how they can parallel process right?
[10:17:37] <doug65536> if you know win32, then an analogy would be $.Deferred is like a CreateEvent object, and $.when is like WaitForMultipleObjects
[10:20:12] <shoky> with deferreds you separate the place where the action is requested (e.g. where you call $.post(...) )  from the place where the response is processed (e.g. the "success" callback or .done().. )
[10:20:40] <shoky> without deferreds/promises you'd have to do those 2 things in the same place
[10:21:01] <shoky> place in code, i mean
[10:24:59] <frank_o> doug65536: here http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ctQyL/2/ basically I need to issue pckry.layout() for each on click function at line 67.. im not sure if that fiddle we worked out can fit into this
[10:25:11] <frank_o> you worked out rather
[10:26:01] <frank_o> doug65536: as you can see pckry.layout() only works for the first item clicked
[10:26:42] <frank_o> I tried to put pckry.layout() inside the on click itself so i wouldnt have to use deferred at all but that didnt seem to work so..
[10:36:10] <frank_o> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/jyc72/ simplified somewhat.. so curious if i should still use $.when.apply($, onClick) there?
[10:42:36] <donta> Is anyone familar with jqueryui's autocomplete function, and want a paid job? msg me if you're interested
[10:45:08] <astropirate_> Anyone know where I can find Bootstrap 3 themes? I don't need web page templates.. just themes for BS3
[10:45:11] <frank_o> doug65536: aaah my bad ofcourse, you were way ahead of me, cheers mate =)
[10:48:30] <frank_o> Anybody know why this won't work? function helloWorld(container) { container.text('Hello world'); } and then later helloWorld('#some_container');

[10:53:49] <EminenceHC> Can anyone see why this javascript is not working in my rails app? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/7472270
[10:57:24] <NoiseEee> EminenceHC: 'ready page:load' is not valid syntax
[10:57:50] <NoiseEee> $(function() { //etc });  <-- do that
[10:58:22] <shoky> EminenceHC: also, .prop('checked', <-- you should only put true/false here. not "true" or "false"
[11:01:03] <RandomCouch> Hey guys, I'm having a very weird problem. I'm making an app with phonegap, and I'm using php for server side code, and ajax to call that code. I haven't had any problems with that so far, but now I made this php file for sending emails, and when I call it with ajax it gives me a 404 error, however when I go on it in my browser it works just fine, what's going on here? It's the same exact link
[11:01:59] <shoky> RandomCouch: check on your server why it's outputting a 404
[11:02:34] <RandomCouch> Well I just fixed it... I just changed the php file's name, and changed it on the ajax call too... It's weird though it was the same exact name
[11:02:42] <shoky> are you sure it's the same type of request? same params? etc
[11:02:49] <RandomCouch> Yup it was all the same
[11:03:08] <shoky> hokay
[11:03:12] <RandomCouch> The application I'm making has over 40 ajax calls so I'm not new to that :P It's just a weird bug
[11:03:23] <RandomCouch> Thanks for help though
[11:07:38] <EminenceHC> NoiseEee: I have changed the syntax to 'ready' instead of  'ready page:load'. $(function() { //etc }); seems to break other query code I have running.
[11:08:12] <EminenceHC> shoky: Where would I put true/false?
[11:08:52] <shoky> EminenceHC: .prop('checked', true)  or .prop('checked', false)
[11:09:06] <shoky> EminenceHC: you put "true" there instead of true
[11:09:10] <EminenceHC> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) {
[11:09:10] <EminenceHC> 		// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced'
[11:09:10] <EminenceHC> 		return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context, rootjQuery );
[11:09:11] <EminenceHC> 	} has no method 'cookie'
[11:09:21] <shoky> whatcha gonna do about it?
[11:09:43] <EminenceHC> shoky: I see, thanks
[11:09:45] <shoky> spam it here and hope someone can think for you..?
[11:10:36] <EminenceHC> shoky: yes
[11:11:28] <filipiz> `api replace
[11:11:29] <b-ot> filipiz: No matches.
[11:12:10] <EminenceHC> shoky: More like, hoping that someone that knows what the hell that means will offer advice.
[11:12:33] <shoky> you can try to figure it out..
[11:12:48] <shoky> something doesn't have a method "cookie"
[11:13:31] <shoky> $.cookie ain't there
[11:14:15] <EminenceHC> shoky: I don't understand, this code works perfectly fine in the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/R73vy/
[11:14:36] <shoky> EminenceHC: the fiddle is including jquery.cookie.js properly
[11:15:27] <EminenceHC> shoky: Ahh so I am missing a library? I thought it was missing something in the code.
[11:15:27] <EminenceHC> shoky: Thank you
[11:21:12] <raj> I have a `beforeRemoveTab` function that I allow someone to pass my plugin. Within my plugin I have a `removeTab` function. I also have a `$container.on('click', '.removeButton', function(){removeTab.call($container, $tab)}` .... should I have the `beforeRemoveTab` call sit in this unnamed function, or should I have the call within the `removeTab` function itself?
[11:25:58] <shoky> raj: generally i wouldn't say it matters much, do whatever makes most sense to your code. for example if you might call removeTab from other places, then if beforeRemoveTab is in that anon function you'll have to copy that call too
[11:26:27] <raj> ahh, I see
[11:26:42] <raj> such foresight, you have
[11:27:41] <raj> so I would be stuck having to call beforeRemoveTab always
[11:27:50] <raj> that's less flexible
[11:27:55] <raj> guess I'll leave it in the anon function then
[11:28:02] <raj> thank you
[11:32:44] <Acrack> hello can comeone tell me why when i log my array, the first value is always "undifined" ? http://jsfiddle.net/MRKNs/
[11:34:31] <raj> shoky, so I'm calling `options.beforeRemoveTab(ev)`, but if it wasn't passed in, it errors. Is there a usual way to do this besides an `if (options.beforeRemoveTab) options.beforeRemoveTab(ev)`?
[11:34:46] <jwmann> I'm looking for method that would insert html into a container div but at the bottom
[11:34:46] <raj> or is that the usual way?
[11:34:59] <raj> jwmann, append()
[11:35:26] <jwmann> raj: Even if there's only 1 container div?
[11:36:02] <raj> jwmann, or take the `var currentstuff = $('#thing').html()` and then add on whatever you want to current_stuff and then set it back equal with $('#thing').html(current_stuff)
[11:36:39] <jwmann> Is there a preferred method?
[11:36:42] <shoky> raj: i'd say that's the usual way ;p  or possibly more robust:   if ($.isFunction( options["beforeRemoveTab"] )) { options.beforeRemoveTab..}
[11:36:43] <raj> jwmann, yes, it just appends to the container
[11:36:50] <raj> ...meaning within the container
[11:36:56] <raj> and as opposed to `prepend`
[11:37:09] <jwmann> Okay thanks!
[11:37:27] <raj> np
[11:37:30] <raj> thanks shoky

[11:57:25] <Bloomberg> Hi Guys!!
[11:59:42] <cfedde> can a selector be three items levels deep? $( '#results_table tbody tr' ).click( do_cool_stuff );
[12:03:35] <Bloomberg> Guys!!, I have a problem with fancybox plugin
[12:05:42] <JackBauer24> cfedde: yes, no problem
[12:06:18] <JackBauer24> cfedde: altough in given example "tbody" doesn't make much sense, since I bet you got all tr-s inside of "tbody"
[12:06:50] <Bloomberg> The second time that I try open it, show me in the console $.fancybox is not a function and for fix it I need to reload the page
[12:07:35] <JackBauer24> Bloomberg: provide a link for a demo page which has this issue
[12:07:55] <cfedde> JackBauer24: thanks.
[12:07:56] <Bloomberg> Ok
[12:11:17] <cfedde> For some other reason then I can't assign a click action to a row inside a table. The table is managed by DataTable if that makes a difference.
[12:11:49] <KeyboardNotFound> I need to create real time updating web app,  which library i need to use ?
[12:13:31] <cfedde> $( 'tr' ).click( do_cool_stuff ); is not "working" for me.
[12:16:29] <cfedde> this works: $( '#results_table tbody tr' ).live('click', do_cool_stuff );
[12:16:34] <cfedde> go figure.
[12:19:48] <NoiseEee> they're totally different cfedde, there's nothing to figure
[12:19:57] <NoiseEee> also you're using the way outdated ".live" instead of ".on"
[12:20:05] <stringoO> is there any reason an ajax 'head' request wouldn't work in ie9? It's working fine on chrome and ie10
[12:20:13] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/etUwoLO/1/
[12:20:17] <Bloomberg> Here is my script
[12:21:35] <JackBauer24> cfedde: .click() even won't be attached to dynamically created DOM elements, unless you initiate click() after creating them
[12:21:39] <JackBauer24> event*
[12:22:04] <cfedde> JackBauer24: It's clear I have a lot to learn.

[12:24:40] <shoky> frank_o: you're passing the selector string to your function. you're not calling $ anywhere
[12:27:29] <frank_o> shoky: oh cool!

[14:09:21] <NoiseEee> Sal: what's "onPageClick" ?
[14:09:31] <Sal> a simple alert
[14:09:37] <Sal> but i put a break point at it
[14:09:43] <Sal> it doesn't get called at all
[14:09:57] <doug65536> Sal: put a breakpoint at the $('.pages li... line
[14:10:01] <Sal> anyway, i'm creating a working sample
[14:10:51] <doug65536> RabSimpson: it is an infinite loop
[14:11:04] <doug65536> RabSimpson: you probably means i < optionArray.length
[14:11:21] <doug65536> meant*
[14:11:23] <RabSimpson> ahhh!
[14:11:31] <RabSimpson> thanks doug65536 :)

[14:12:48] <Sal> never mind, i founf the error
[14:12:50] <Sal> thanks anyway
[14:13:01] <shoky> why "anyway"
[14:13:11] <Sal> always then
[14:13:13] <Sal> :)
[14:13:15] <shoky> you didn't magically find it ;p
[14:13:27] <doug65536> lol
[14:14:31] <doug65536> RabSimpson: lol @ the arrays
[14:15:26] <doug65536> RabSimpson: also, use a switch statement, don't pount on selector lookups and val over and over
[14:15:30] <doug65536> pound*
[14:15:49] <lacrymology> doug65536: no, not to submit. I run a local function using the data, filter some client-side stuff. The server never knows about it
[14:16:20] <doug65536> lacrymology: serializeArray is the most convenient way to get form values for further processing in the script
[14:16:39] <lacrymology> doug65536: yeah, I'm looking at it
[14:16:45] <RabSimpson> thanks doug65536, that was in the back of my mind when adding the if/else statements. i usually work with php so js syntax is still a little new each time i go back to it :P
[14:19:17] <lacrymology> doug65536: I'm not getting the text input's value =/
[14:19:33] <doug65536> lacrymology: is it disabled? disabled things are ignored
[14:20:13] <lacrymology> doug65536: nope, not disabled
[14:27:31] <lacrymology> doug65536: yup, still not working... weird
[14:29:47] <doug65536> lacrymology: if you don't have any duplicate names, this fiddle has a helper function that will make an object with input names for property names http://jsfiddle.net/mtn2G/3/
[14:30:28] <doug65536> it doesn't try to duplicate serializeArray at all. serializeArray is built to handle duplicates but it is more annoying to use. my function makes an object
[14:31:13] <doug65536> lacrymology: oops, bugfix http://jsfiddle.net/mtn2G/4/
[14:31:34] <lacrymology> doug65536: ah, no. I was missing the name attribute =)
[14:32:38] <doug65536> lacrymology: still, serialize array's name isn't kidding. it returns an array. you would have to search for the entry with the right name. the helper I provided makes an object where you can use dot notation to get a certain named element. up to you
[14:34:58] <doug65536> lacrymology: better example http://jsfiddle.net/mtn2G/5/
[14:42:04] <RabSimpson> doug65536: are you still around?
[14:42:11] <doug65536> RabSimpson: yes
[14:43:25] <RabSimpson> :) i was wondering if you might be able to take a quick look at this again. functionally everything is perfect, but the word 'undefined' is appearing on the page within #li--5 for some reason: http://pastebin.com/xiWwB6Fw
[14:43:49] <RabSimpson> the contents of that li are reloaded near the bottom
[14:44:46] <RabSimpson> also no errors in the console :/
[14:45:25] <RabSimpson> the appearance of 'undefined' is in addition to the things that it's actually meant to be putting in there, which it is successfully
[14:50:00] <lacrymology> is there a selector that means "find me an item whose children have these properties"?
[14:50:44] <lacrymology> I mean that it actually returns the (non-direct) parent object
[14:50:45] <lacrymology> ancestor
[14:50:49] <doug65536> no, but you can use .filter to do that
[14:50:53] <doug65536> what properties do you mean
[14:51:13] <lacrymology> doug65536: no good, I'm dealing with a plugin, and it accepts a selector
[14:51:47] <doug65536> lacrymology: ok, then use what you have
[14:52:04] <doug65536> set a data attribute on the element and pass a selector that selects for that
[14:52:49] <doug65536> what properties
[14:53:16] <doug65536> the answer is "no", unless you can be more specific about what it is about the parent that you want to select for
[14:53:28] <lacrymology> doug65536: I'm typing
[14:53:30] <[Nord]> Hi! How can I sort the results of a selector by their order in the document? The problem is with the elements inserted later, they appear on the end of the list, instead of their place in the document. I have to use jQuery 1.6.4, if that matters.
[14:53:41] <RabSimpson> doug65536: i take it nothing is glaring in that paste?
[14:54:18] <doug65536> RabSimpson: you should initialize liContent to ''
[14:54:30] <RabSimpson> ok, just a sec
[14:55:06] <RabSimpson> perfect :D
[14:55:18] <RabSimpson> doug65536: you're a star mate, thanks again :)
[14:55:33] <lacrymology> doug65536: I have a <div.persona> with a bunch of data in it: name, description, that kind of thing. Those things are in their own divs, <p>s, whatever. I've populated data-content attributes in each of the elements that describe the value, and a class that reflects the attribute. so <p class="persona-name" data-content="foo"> and when I search for foo, I create the following selector: ".persona-name[data-content*="<value of the search text>"]". But
[14:55:42] <lacrymology> the .persona div

[14:59:18] <clime> hey, I use select2 jquery plugin together with magnific popup. If I click on the select in an open popup, searchbox with some results appears. The problem is that it is impossible to type anything into the searchbox - cursor just does not appear. Here is jsfiddle that demonstrates the problem http://jsfiddle.net/clime/qweWa/14/. Anyone cares to help?
[15:01:34] <doug65536> lacrymology: http://jsfiddle.net/Q78tn/
[15:02:39] <lacrymology> doug65536: it works either way. I found a workaround, instead of returning that filter, I use it, then call .parents('.persona').addClass('paint') and then I return filter: ".paint"
[15:02:51] <lacrymology> doug65536: no, you don't understand the issue, let me show you

[15:04:50] <quup> Hi, I'm injecting code into everything that matches $('.example') They are created dynamically by another script (that I don't control) so I use a MutationObserver that reacts on new '.example' elements. Is this the right way to do it or can on() be used for this purpose?
[15:06:02] <clime> I have already done some basic research and there seems to be some focus/blur loop in select2.js. It even does make chrome chuckle if you inspect the input in developer tools.

A function I created to do this can be seen here: http://pastebin.com/yD7anQf1 I am trying to allow the scenario where if this function is called again before the animation series from the last call ends, then the current animation will completely stop, and make way for the new message.

[15:13:42] <doug65536> lacrymology: depending on how the plugin is implemented, it might accept the value of 'sel' from this http://jsfiddle.net/Q78tn/2/
[15:14:22] <cfedde> All the examples in DataTables.net show using $( 'sel' ).live(...) to hook behaviors to elements in the dynamic table.  But .live is not in 1.9. Is anyone aware of a workaround? or is it time for me to start using a different data grid viewer?

[15:19:21] <mysterty> hello, i have stupid question, i would handle input change event, i tried many things, like $(".locality_input").on("change keyup", updateCoords());, but they only work on page loaded, not after on the fly :s
[15:19:32] <mysterty> someone could help me please ?
[15:19:37] <doug65536> cfedde: did you see if there is an updated version of the plugin?
[15:20:03] <doug65536> cfedde: there is a compatibility plugin though...
[15:20:13] <lacrymology> mysterty: what kind of input do you want to handle?
[15:20:30] <doug65536> cfedde: try the jquery migrate plugin
[15:20:42] <zakj> mysterty: if you want to call updateCoords on change/keyup (rather than calling a function returned by updateCoords), change "updateCoords()" to "updateCoords"
[15:20:43] <mysterty> both input text and combo box
[15:20:46] <lacrymology> mysterty: your code should be something like ....on("change keyup", updateCoords) (without the call `()`)
[15:21:19] <lacrymology> mysterty: ok, try removing the () and change 'keyup' for 'input' (so "change input")
[15:21:28] <cfedde> doug65536: thanks!
[15:21:43] <synth_> hello, i'm curious if i'm able to load a html document via ajax that also contains javascript and have that javascript code render on load?
[15:22:11] <mysterty> What a noob's mistake... Thx lacrymology, thex doug65536 ^^'
[15:23:01] <scipy53> Ok I see, it seems I cannot stop a delay() .. ?
[15:23:10] <scipy53> Is there any way to do so?
[15:25:24] <doug65536> synth_: you can create a document fragment from the response and append a script tag to the head with the text from the response script tag
[15:26:20] <doug65536> synth_: that's about as specific as I can be with what you've provided
[15:26:52] <doug65536> synth_: you could also just slap the response into the document somewhere and it should run the script tags
[15:27:03] <synth_> hm
[15:27:15] <doug65536> depends
[15:27:59] <synth_> so if i were to do that, would said appended script tag have access to functions that have already been rendered on the parent document?
[15:29:15] <doug65536> $.get('blahblah', function(response) { var df = $(response); $('script', df).each(function() { var s = $('<script/>').text($(this).text()); $('head').append(s); }); });
[15:29:28] <doug65536> I *think* that will "run" all the scripts in the ajax response
[15:29:47] <synth_> what i'm doing is loading my pages via ajax, each page is actually a cgi-bin python file, however, one page in particular, i want to load immediately and have part of the document that loads slower run the same ajax function from the parent to grab the data needed
[15:30:24] <synth_> (if that makes sense... it makes sense in my head, haha)
[15:33:20] <synth_> so now i'm curious what the head actually is, are all items stored there considered global for the site to utilize, or are <script> tags executed on page load and then loaded into memory as runnable code?
[15:33:24] <jhoffmcd> I have 10 radio buttons on a form, how can I fire off a function if one of them is clicked? Is it the same as doing it for one?
[15:37:23] <benth> how can i tell when an element's dimensions change?
[15:37:48] <efco> jhoffmcd couldn't you just use focus() ?
[15:37:50] <doug65536> you can't
[15:38:14] <doug65536> you can tell when the window dimensions change though, that is usually enough
[15:38:48] <jhoffmcd> I think I can use .click() but im wondering if the best method to do this changes when you have an array of radio buttions as a variable
[15:39:55] <synth_> jhoffmcd i'd assign id's to the radio buttons then use a .click() and capture the elements attr("id") to know which you've clicked
[15:40:06] <synth_> but i'm a noob so maybe there's a better way
[15:43:49] <efco> jhoffmcd synth_ http://jsfiddle.net/Ut9wD/
[15:44:03] <efco> that seems to work well
[15:44:57] <synth_> is that the same as calling the "id" attr?
[15:45:31] <synth_> is data-option an actual attribute for inputs, or is that just something you came up with?
[15:46:06] <synth_> (i'm honestly very curious as i'm knee deep in code like this right now too)
[15:46:30] <efco> i keep getting disconnected, did my jsfiddle link go through?
[15:46:40] <synth_> yep, i asked a few questions though
[15:46:44] <efco> ah
[15:47:04] <synth_> is that the same as calling the "id" attr?; is data-option an actual attribute for inputs, or is that just something you came up with? ; (i'm honestly very curious as i'm knee deep in code like this right now too)
[15:47:26] <efco> data-* is just a way to store arbitrary data in the element
[15:48:11] <synth_> interesting. i'm doing something similar with my current project where i store <a href="page" root="cgi-bin/content">anchor</a>
[15:48:27] <jhoffmcd> efco: thats cool, I'm gonna try that out!
[15:48:34] <jhoffmcd> super clean
[15:48:37] <synth_> root was just a random attribute i came up with, so i'm curious if i could use data-option instead
[15:48:43] <efco> you could
[15:49:02] <efco> by storing it in data-option it allows you to do the $(this).data() inside the function
[15:49:34] <synth_> awesome, i think i'm going to have to change that around then
[15:49:37] <synth_> thanks for the tip
[15:49:54] <ech0s7> hi
[15:49:56] <efco> youre welcome
[15:50:28] <ech0s7> http://jsfiddle.net/zn7gb/2/ i would put logo_fb at bottom of left menu panel, i have setted bottom:0 but it doesn't works
[15:51:07] <doug65536> synth_: all attributes that begin with data- are reserved for developers. you can make data-pancakes and data-cylinderheads if you want
[15:51:23] <synth_> oh really
[15:51:27] <synth_> awesome :D
[15:51:39] <synth_> so wait
[15:52:00] <synth_> oh nevermind, i understand now. i forgot data() took arguments
[15:52:01] <systemfault> I don't want to wait!
[15:52:12] <efco> synth_ say you used data-foo. you'd grab it with $(el).data('foo')
[15:52:40] <synth_> yeah, i see that now in your jsfiddle example
[15:52:42] <synth_> :)
[15:53:07] <efco> ech0s7 that sounds like a css question
[15:53:15] <efco> maybe try ##css ?
[15:53:33] <efco> ech0s7 #css * not ##css
[15:54:26] <malibu> So many IRC channels are ID based and not class based
[15:54:36] <malibu> #css and not .css
[15:55:01] <synth_> lol
[15:55:07] <synth_> *rimshot*
[15:55:19] <malibu> buudda bah psssssh
[16:22:02] <zanberdo> I am having difficulty using jquery validate with a jquery ui dialog.  Specifically jquery validate does not appear to validate the form at submit. valid() always returns true.  I've also noticed that if I define a submitHandler the submit is never performed.   I've searched and search but haven't found a satisfactory answer. Question: can one use jquery validate with a jquery ui dialog?  if not, what should one use?
[16:30:42] <zanberdo> to add a little detail, the individual validations work as expected while filling out the form: required fields are flagged if left empty, equalTo qualifiers are checked as expected, etc.  It's just at submit that things break down.
[17:23:26] <synth_> so i've got a python script that takes a few seconds to run which i'm loading via .ajax(), however, the script executes and returns empty data to jquery, but in the shell it returns the data as expected. python script is executable and my ajax timeout has been set to a high enough number that it wouldn't actually time out...any ideas?
[17:25:59] <synth_> ah, figured it out. Error: UnauthorizedAccessException: Access is denied to directory '/mnt/deadline_repository'

[19:32:18] <Eagle5> are there any good places you guys know about to learn jQuery?
[19:36:01] <grafi> depends probably
[19:50:27] <daftspunk> will .closest() return itself if there is a match?
[19:51:38] <grafi> itself?
[19:52:03] <daftspunk> well technically the closest thing to $('<a />').closest('a'); is $('<a />')
[19:52:55] <gnarf> yes
[19:53:05] <Nomikos> I thought closest would always start searching upwards?
[19:53:11] <gnarf> daftspunk: closest starts at self
[19:53:15] <gnarf> it is used for delegation checks
[19:53:17] <daftspunk> gnarf! awesome
[19:53:29] <daftspunk> Nomikos: would have to be .parent().closest() for that
[19:53:46] <Nomikos> I must keep that in mind then
[19:54:18] <daftspunk> yes i was about to write a something = element.is('a') ? element : element.closest('a'); but wanted to make sure
[19:56:49] <daftspunk> does .first() work on regular JS objects?
[19:57:24] <daftspunk> var obj = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 } $(obj).first()
[19:57:36] * daftspunk has to ask here because docs are down for him
[20:05:41] <pixelpimp> daftspunk: very likely not
[20:06:30] <daftspunk> thanks!
[20:06:44] <pixelpimp> function first(obj) { for (var first in obj) return first; }
[20:06:56] <daftspunk> ^
[20:07:06] <daftspunk> ty :)
[20:07:14] <pixelpimp> a little hacky but should work
[20:08:04] <daftspunk> is it possible to find instances of <input name="x" /> and <input name="array[x]" /> in the same selector, something like
[20:08:05] <daftspunk> form.find('[name="'+fieldName+'"], [name="*['+fieldName+']"]').focus()
[20:10:21] <daftspunk> i think maybe i have my star around the wrong way

[23:00:00] <Cache_Money> I want an element to be both clickable and double-clickable, should I use a delay on the click event http://jsfiddle.net/KpCwN/431/  Or would you recommend using the dblclick() event handler?
[23:21:51] <Cache_Money> How would I recreate this in jquery 1.10?  http://jsfiddle.net/KpCwN/431/
[23:22:02] <doug65536> Cache_Money: why wouldn't you use dblclick?
[23:22:30] <Cache_Money> doub65536: because I'm also using the click() event handler on the same element
[23:23:00] <Cache_Money> I couldn't get it to work and found this example, which works but with 1.6 but I'm running 1.10
[23:24:56] <doug65536> Cache_Money: the .live function is deprecated and removed
[23:25:03] <doug65536> Cache_Money: use .on instead
[23:25:21] <Cache_Money> ahh, cool thanks
[23:27:12] <Cache_Money> doug65536: Why is it still not working?  http://jsfiddle.net/ruUND/
[23:28:34] <doug65536> Cache_Money: the id is double_click, not double-click
[23:28:49] <Cache_Money> doh!
[23:29:04] <doug65536> Cache_Money: also, the clicks variable is not defined
[23:29:51] <Cache_Money> doug65536: I had those variables defined on my machine, forgot to copy them over

[23:33:43] <d3m0n> Hey guys, would someone mind checking out a pretty straight forward click event where I am trying to get the first ul of $(this) click event to show http://jsfiddle.net/U5aKT/
[23:35:07] <d3m0n> I also tried $('> ul',this)
[23:37:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> `api children @ d3m0n
[23:37:52] <b-ot> d3m0n: .children(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[23:38:03] <Cork> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/U5aKT/2/
[23:38:19] <Cork> d3m0n: ul isn't a child of a so you need to use sibling there
[23:38:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry Cork is right sibling
[23:38:34] <d3m0n> I used find?
[23:38:35] <Cork> this is pointless as it points to the document, so you can just use $('ul')
[23:39:00] <Cork> d3m0n: find searches in decedents
[23:39:10] <d3m0n> Ok didnt know that
[23:39:14] <d3m0n> Ty
[23:39:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> d3m0n: creating dropdown menus are we ?
[23:40:00] <d3m0n> Yeah no need for bloated js to crowd my code
[23:40:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[23:40:17] <d3m0n> Cork, and if there are more than one ULs in that list?
[23:40:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> actually if your doing dropdowns
[23:40:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> most of it can be actually done in css
[23:40:36] <Cork> d3m0n: then you need to figure out how to isolate them
[23:40:53] <d3m0n> Thats why I was trying to go with "> ul"
[23:41:01] <Cork> d3m0n: $(this).find() is the EXACT same thing as $()
[23:41:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> d3m0n: again this functionality can be done in css alone
[23:41:06] <Cork> in this event handler
[23:41:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> using animation and transition
[23:41:38] <Cork> d3m0n: ul isn't a direct child of document
[23:41:45] <Cork> only head and body is that
[23:41:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait why is he using document .click
[23:42:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the first place
[23:42:07] <Cork> cause he wants all clicks on the page
[23:42:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> wouldnt it be better to target the a
[23:42:14] <Cork> no
[23:42:21] <d3m0n> IF you click outside of the menu
[23:42:22] <Cork> cause then the second case wouldn't be handled
[23:42:23] <d3m0n> it shoud disappear
[23:42:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh i see
[23:42:38] <d3m0n> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[23:42:40] <Cork> d3m0n: though i would invert that if case
[23:42:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> a "deselection"
[23:42:51] <Cork> cause it makes it easy to misread it
[23:43:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> i actually wnated to know how to do that for the lngest time
[23:43:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks for teaching me something
[23:43:16] <Cork> d3m0n: http://jsfiddle.net/U5aKT/3/
[23:43:48] <d3m0n> Haha okay thnx
[23:43:57] <Cork> there is problems with this method though
[23:44:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> Cork: so for this case you cant run the hide/show stuff using css right?
[23:44:19] <Cork> cause the event is bubbling means all elements in the page that you actually click will act on that click
[23:44:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> ?
[23:44:54] <Cork> ex. if you click an ajax button outside the menu
[23:45:04] <Cork> that button will first act and then the event will bubble up
[23:45:10] <Cork> and finnaly trigger the close of the menu
[23:45:26] <Cork> normally you want it the other way around
[23:45:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh okay
[23:45:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> get it
[23:45:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks
[23:45:41] <Cork> or rather normally you want it to not act on the page click
[23:45:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> okays
[23:46:04] <Cork> there is fairly easy ways around that though
[23:46:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[23:46:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[23:46:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> tie to hit the hay
[23:47:04] <raj> shoky, wanted to discuss some conceptual stuff whenever you get a chance
[23:47:22] <d3m0n> The first answer to that stackexhange suggests stopPropagation but would disable any other actions inside that element
[23:48:25] <d3m0n> The thirst answer seems to wrap the click function with the element first then call the whole page click
[23:48:28] <d3m0n> third
[23:49:04] <d3m0n> Is that what you mean by not bubbeling up
[23:51:21] <Cork> d3m0n: the way events work in a page is that (skipping a bit) the event starts on the element you actually clicked
[23:51:42] <Cork> and then it bubbles up to the parents until it reaches window
[23:52:02] <Cork> the event listeners are fired on each parent as it bubbles
[23:52:24] <Cork> that means events bound closer to the clicked element fires before the event listener higher up in the tree
[23:53:03] <Cork> d3m0n: also meaning that the event listener on document can't prevent the event from firing on ex. the a tag
[23:53:13] <Cork> simply cause it has already fired when it gets there
[23:53:33] <d3m0n> Hrmm okay thats makes sense
[23:53:53] <Cork> an option is to set a class on body or similar when the menu is visible
[23:54:15] <Cork> and have the other event listeners check for that class before they do anything
[23:54:23] <Cork> or you could use a global variable if you prefer that
