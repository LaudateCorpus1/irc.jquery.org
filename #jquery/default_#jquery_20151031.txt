[00:16:49] <hexdj> can variables be defined twice in jquery?
[00:17:01] <hexdj> like this? https://monosnap.com/file/ubAvZnSZhoVvHzJjxA2pZgHyiq4Hxc
[00:17:42] <rcyr> Yup but it's sloppy code
[00:17:55] <hexdj> how so rcyr ?
[00:18:09] <rcyr> You only need to declare a variable once.
[00:18:19] <rcyr> You can reuse it as many times as you want after.
[00:18:39] <hexdj> yeah but the problem is that it never does what it's supposed to do in the first def.
[00:18:42] <hexdj> right?
[00:18:59] <rcyr> You overwrite the first value with the second one
[00:19:07] <hexdj> ok that's what I thought
[00:19:17] <hexdj> it's not my code, it's a fork I am trying to get to work
[00:19:23] <rcyr> I see
[00:22:42] <hexdj> ugh, now to figure out which part is supposed to load when
[00:23:35] <hexdj> woot, I think I got it, firs strike
[00:23:36] <hexdj> lol
[00:30:13] <muks_> Hi friends.. why this checkbox not getting unchecked..
[00:30:15] <muks_> http://jsfiddle.net/1f1yasnf/
[00:31:53] <robhol> muks_: um, when should it get unchecked?
[00:34:00] <muks_> if any radio is selected then clicking checkbox should uncheck it.. but clicking again checkbox should uncheck checkbox
[00:34:20] <muks_> so checkbox should have normal behaviour
[00:34:37] <muks_> only its clicking will uncheck radio button if checked
[00:35:02] <robhol> then remove the "true" on l5
[00:35:28] <robhol> that will set the property instead of getting it :)
[00:49:26] <hexdj> %B4465420396011173^MARTINEZ/EDUARDO^1806201100001040000000345000000?;4465420396011173=1806201104003345?
[00:53:08] <hexdj> wtf
[00:54:55] <muks_> robhol: how will I check if it is checked so I can make radio unchecked
[00:56:14] <robhol> muks_: that's what line 5 will do once you remove the "true"
[00:56:24] <muks_> http://jsfiddle.net/1f1yasnf/
[00:56:29] <robhol> x.prop("x", 3") - set x to 3
[00:56:36] <robhol> x.prop("x") get x
[00:56:44] <robhol> this is how most things work in jquery
[00:57:21] <robhol> function(name) to get things (function can be attr, prop, data, val, etc), function(name, value) to set them
[00:57:44] <muks_> Wow thanks robhol:
[00:58:33] <robhol> x as the object was a terrible example, but you get the idea :D
[01:13:26] <muks_> :D
[03:29:36] <Guest12296> hello everyone, i need some help regarding to drag and drop image, when i drag image my browser page can't scroll up to bottom.
[03:30:53] <Guest12296> which event i used to scroll page when i drag image?
[06:32:59] <jop008> I have a piece of Html where I want to insert some fields. My approach say parse the collapsible sets and get the new string during parsing
[06:33:19] <jop008> I start with this $("div[data-role=collapsibleset]").each(function (event) {
[06:33:47] <jop008> this is fine but what's next childs of collapsible set is <div id = 'company_risk' data-role = 'collapsible'>
[07:16:30] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/65je <--- can I get help with this? I get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'drawImage' of undefined
[08:08:43] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/l5sk <--- can you help? nothing is drawn
[10:17:29] <StephenS> I need to send certain ajax call when mouse is inside element #x, however if I do mouseover, it will send multiple ajax calls (since event is triggered as long as mouse is inside x element), how to avoid this?
[10:19:23] <adb123> maybe set a global variable or scoped boolean variable after the ajax has been called. Check if that variable is true/false. Then on success or failure callback reset that variable
[10:20:32] <StephenS> I tried that, but since flag is in scope for mouseover, it wont do much
[10:20:48] <StephenS> I have multiple objects of the same type, so doing only one flag won't make any good
[10:21:27] <adb123> sorry i meant before the ajax call.
[10:21:58] <adb123> or it would need to be above the mouseover event
[10:26:42] <adb123> https://jsfiddle.net/Lgh5df4u/
[10:26:50] <adb123> Something like that?
[10:29:49] <StephenS> adb123, that would work but I have multiple objects
[10:30:23] <StephenS> something like $x.on("mouseover", ".someEl", function(e) { });
[10:30:38] <lemonsparrow> https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/f29c2e4d055fbbca0778 I'm facing this lint issue... how can I resolve it ?
[10:30:49] <adb123> got it. multiple objects of .someEl on the page, correct?
[10:31:59] <StephenS> yes
[10:33:26] <adb123> there are no differences between all those?
[10:33:55] <adb123> are these generated elements or hardcoded?
[10:36:08] <StephenS> adb123, depends
[10:36:20] <StephenS> some elements are pulled from resource and appended to #X
[10:37:57] <StephenS> oh well I know whats the issue
[10:38:22] <StephenS> now just to resolve it :P
[10:39:14] <adb123> yup. good luck :)
[10:42:21] <StephenS> ok solved
[10:42:35] <adb123> nice
[10:42:41] <StephenS> I end up debugging it in console log, just to see what element is pulled, but long story short, its resolved.
[10:43:10] <adb123> cool. rubber duck programming
[10:43:38] <Benek> Hi guys - I have a question..do you think that IT Studies (University/College) are necessary to become a programmer? Programmer with a job of course.
[10:44:09] <StephenS> Benek, thats not jQuery related question
[10:44:41] <StephenS> Benek, #chat might answer you that.
[10:44:54] <Benek> Oh okay - I am sorry than. I did not know that could be a problem.
[10:47:37] <adb123> Benek no its not but you will struggle to find a good job at first if you are not a top dev. Your first job also sets in motion the pay you will get
[11:20:54] <enerel> Hello anyone know a good radio button plugin?
[11:26:50] <enerel> anyone know a decent jquery plugin that scrambles div?
[11:28:07] <enerel> anyone home?

[11:29:31] <enerel> jquery decent plugin for shuffling DIV's?
[11:30:02] <enerel> i wanted to say shuffle adb123

[11:39:33] <enerel> can i use isotope on my website not commercial?
[11:41:36] <adb123> I don't know what that is. Read their license.
[11:45:55] <bojanlazic> Why this isn't acting like click on li:hover https://jsfiddle.net/0dcpmd68/ ?
[11:49:30] <enerel> anyone here from iSotope shiffler?

[13:17:52] <tuskkk___> can someone please help me figure out what is wrong with the script here? http://www.whitesquaremedia.tumblr.com/
[13:20:52] <enerel> anyone familiar with isotope?
[13:25:11] <robhol> tuskkk___: you generally stand a better chance if you post a jsfiddle link and more info (what you expect, what happens, etc)
[13:26:37] <tuskkk___> robhol: I am not sure what to post as a fiddle right now. Its a video which loads some tags based on the JSON its getting from the backend. But on loading it seems to hang up the browser saying unresponsive script.
[13:26:49] <tuskkk___> Tell me what to share and I will show you the code.

[15:06:04] <ubuntuisloved> Iâ€™m trying to get a custom attribute from an element when clicked. But I keep getting undefined. https://jsfiddle.net/gfhmkL0p/
[16:01:21] <rodigan> I am displaying data at various intervals from the internet. i need to display the data individually. if new data arrives how can i save that data without overwriting it as a result of popping the currently displayed data off an array and then saving the state of the array?
[17:11:44] <Blaster> Is it possible to prevent "changing" a numeric input to a number greater than x? I am listening to on('change') and returning false, but it doesn't prevent the value of the input from being changed.
[18:23:58] <tomasm-> hi, is there a way to make sortable items snap to the placeholders? As of right now, when I drag items  around, it floats  freely and  it would be nice to not budge until my cursor is already past the threshold, and then go all the way to the new spot.
[18:44:04] <bobsaccamano> Hi..I'm facing an issue with a jquery plugin that adds a fullscreen image slider to homepages (supersized): the images don't show up on certain devices/browsers. I've hosted the images in a S3 bucket on AWS. Any idea how to go ahead debugging the problem?
[18:44:53] <jonez> bobsaccamano, use dev tools in browser and look at the "net" tab (or similar)
[18:45:09] <jonez> bobsaccamano, also look at error_log of server for clues.
[18:49:38] <bobsaccamano> jonez: thanks. It seems that the images are downloaded but aren't rendering. Also, it seems like the issue is only seen on certain screen resolutions (mobile, ipad etc..)
[18:49:55] <jonez> hmmm
[20:08:32] <mdev> any control that I can load 1mb+ worth of text in quickly and scroll through easy, as textarea is slow
[20:08:37] <mdev> and freezes the pages after awhile
[20:22:39] <mdev> for anyone wondering
[20:22:43] <mdev> the answer is this
[20:23:31] <mdev> textarea apparently has limit of 64k, so a much faster alternative appears to be simply filling a regular div with the text as their is no limit
[20:23:44] <mdev> you can add scroll bar and even make it editable
[20:24:04] <mdev> googling found me parts of code i'm slapping together to make this work
[20:30:09] <mdev> using <pre> also makes it super fast
[20:30:16] <mdev> as don't have to replace lines with <br>
[20:30:46] <mdev> having trouble making the div respect the data height using pre though
[20:30:59] <mdev> using bootstrap and before it'd auto push down the page however far
[20:31:01] <mdev> now doesn't
[22:56:32] <theskillwithin> happy halloween
