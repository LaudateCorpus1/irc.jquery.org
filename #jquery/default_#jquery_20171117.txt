[00:28:07] <loubloom> Can someone help me find and get a piece of data? I'm trying to use one unique data-attr to retrieve another data-attr from the same element. I can I get the element, I just keep getting 'undefined' when I try to log it to console
[00:28:36] <loubloom> *I can get the element..
[01:00:34] <loubloom> Here is a pastebin of what I'm talking about: https://pastebin.com/raw/y9VLUR4V
[01:01:06] <loubloom> That script returns 'undefined'. I'm using .attr() instead of .data() because it's an older version of jQuery
[07:32:32] <molexus> hi, what would be the best way to defer execution of any class methods until after the class constructor finishes execution (it runs an ajax in order to pull some initial config data from the server)
[07:49:52] <Cork> molexus: $.Callback is one option
[07:52:30] <molexus> Cork: thank you. i appreciate the pointer. could you help me with some implementation principles, please? i'm kinda new to jquery and .Callbacks are yet unknown to me.
[07:53:06] <Cork> molexus: $.Callback is just a way to allow a function caller to bind a chain of callbacks
[07:53:15] <Cork> and they will then be called in order
[07:56:45] <pokmo> i'm getting an expected error: TypeError: ab.venue2.desktop.map.OverlayMap is not a constructor but OverlayMap should be a constructor
[07:56:51] <pokmo> here's the code https://dpaste.de/8mW1
[07:56:58] <pokmo> line 3 causes the error
[07:57:01] <pokmo> am I missing something?
[07:57:15] <Cork> molexus: psudo code, but something like this https://jsfiddle.net/rfq5bwdt/
[07:57:41] <pokmo> here's the code https://dpaste.de/tN42
[07:57:56] <Cork> pokmo: you haven't included what creates that reference
[07:58:20] <Cork> or it isn't called before you run that code
[07:58:26] <Cork> or you've created it in another scope
[07:58:33] <Cork> impossible to tell from the pb
[07:58:48] <pokmo> Cork, what do you mean by 'what creates that reference'?
[07:59:17] <Cork> pokmo: the error means when the parser tries to execute that line it can't find ab.venue2.desktop.map.OverlayMap
[07:59:24] <Cork> cause it isn't created
[07:59:30] <Cork> why i can't say with so little info
[07:59:48] <pokmo> is there a way to see if it's created in the call stack?
[08:00:04] <Cork> the call stack says it isn't
[08:00:11] <Cork> so nothing to look for
[08:01:44] <pokmo> hmm
[08:02:03] <pokmo> Cork, i can't quite see why it isn't created though. the js is included before the function is called
[08:02:26] <Cork> i can't help you with the info you've provided
[08:04:53] <pokmo> they're actually in the same file
[08:04:59] <pokmo> the declaration and the call
[08:05:08] <Cork> pokmo: if you want help provide the code
[08:05:49] <pokmo> i'll try to make it shorter
[08:13:40] <molexus> Cork: it took my a while but i understand your example now. there's one usage issue i'm having with it: the subsequent "method calls" are actually outside of the Connect class. If possible i would like to have everything inside it and be able to use it as: new Connect().publicMethodCall1().publicMethodCall2() ... etc
[08:13:49] <molexus> all of which would be defined inside Connect(){}
[08:14:08] <Cork> molexus: provide a jsfiddle showing your problem
[08:14:21] <molexus> ok, one sec
[08:19:50] <molexus> Cork: pseudo-code: https://jsfiddle.net/tusmydLe/
[08:20:27] <Hollusion> everytime i mount a partitioni via thunar it wants my password. how do i disable this? was hoping the "disk" group would fix this
[08:20:55] <Cork> molexus: did you really intend to store the result of the function in Foo?
[08:21:08] <molexus> yes
[08:21:16] <Cork> ah, ya missed a part
[08:21:50] <molexus> flag is supposed to be a "private" property :P
[08:22:13] <Cork> ya, i get it
[08:22:29] <Hollusion> seems liek i need xfce-polkit-git? is this correct?
[08:22:50] <Cork> i would prob provide a function in the class that is ex. initialized(function() {})
[08:23:10] <Cork> and have that function execute the code if it is else it just appends it to the ajax call object
[08:24:20] <molexus> i would have to code this initialized() function into every method of Foo(), right? there's no "magic" i can do to hook myself into every method call from that class?
[08:25:08] <Cork> molexus: https://jsfiddle.net/tusmydLe/1/
[08:25:34] <Cork> Hollusion: your prob in the wrong channel
[08:26:01] <Hollusion> damn ... i am
[08:26:04] <Hollusion> sorry about that
[08:37:31] <molexus> Cork: thank you. this should be enough to get me going
[08:37:37] <molexus> super appreciate your help
[09:18:31] <zmf> I've got "aa<br>bb", how can I get the 'bb' part of it? $("br").nextAll().text() returns the empty string: https://jsfiddle.net/vxmudfbr/
[09:19:42] <Cork> zmf: best option is to add a span around the text you want to work with
[09:20:02] <Cork> else you will have to grab the content of the parent element and remove the html you don't want (note html, not dom)
[09:20:27] <Cork> cause there isn't a clean way to work with text wrapping elements in the dom
[09:20:56] <zmf> I can't modify the HTML, it's for scraping purposes.
[09:21:21] <Cork> then you will have to do something like parent.html().split('<br>')[1]
[09:21:24] <zmf> Text elements are also nodes within the DOM, I think.
[09:21:28] <Cork> no
[09:21:30] <Cork> they aren't
[09:21:36] <Cork> there are text nodes
[09:21:39] <Cork> but then you can't use the dom
[09:21:49] <zmf> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Node/nodeType
[09:21:52] <zmf> yeah nextNodes
[09:21:56] <Cork> (you would have to go one step up into the nod tree not the dom)
[09:22:06] <Cork> and then you would have to handle that harry mess
[09:22:19] <Cork> as you have text fragments not text
[09:22:27] <zmf> hm
[09:22:46] <zmf> then I will go with the html().split() procedure
[12:19:26] <freezo> Hi, I got this json array ---> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/
[12:19:43] <freezo> how to get html look like it do in that jsfiddle?
[12:19:48] <taplar> not an array
[12:20:05] <taplar> that's all objects
[12:20:09] <freezo> taplar: that is what I got from the server
[12:20:23] <taplar> i'm just correcting your verbage
[12:20:27] <taplar> you should know that's not an array
[12:20:30] <freezo> is it possible to get it to html of what I have?
[12:20:46] <taplar> sure
[12:20:53] <taplar> so the number is the count of elements?
[12:21:09] <freezo> yes, i want to count them instead
[12:21:32] <taplar> ok, so for starters you can use Object.keys(variable) to get an array of the keys on the object
[12:21:50] <taplar> that will get you your date strings
[12:22:13] <taplar> then you can forEach over that array, find the element in the object by the keys, and do whatever you want with their values
[12:25:49] <freezo> taplar, something like this gave me nothing --> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/1/
[12:26:18] <taplar> so think about what you are doing
[12:26:25] <taplar> why are you trying to each over the ul
[12:26:30] <taplar> given my previous statements
[12:27:01] <freezo> even if I console.log I got nothing here -> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/2/
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> freezo you realize that "variable" isn't set to anything, right?
[12:27:30] <taplar> also "variable" was a placeholder for whatever your real variable is
[12:27:49] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:28:09] <freezo> I use firebase and this is what I get
[12:28:16] <taplar> which as of right now, you're json isn't assigned to any variable
[12:28:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/3/
[12:29:52] <freezo> https://i.imgur.com/lS95yda.png
[12:30:05] <taplar> just update the fiddle dude
[12:30:12] <robertmaxrees> freezo how are you getting that data from firebase?
[12:31:04] <freezo> by using firebase function call snap
[12:32:07] <robertmaxrees> freezo can you paste what that call looks like into the fiddle>?
[12:34:10] <freezo> robertmaxrees --> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/4/
[12:34:52] <robertmaxrees> so your data is inside that snap?
[12:35:16] <freezo> yes
[12:36:07] <robertmaxrees> so then you do all the stuff you're doing with the object in the fiddle, but refer to "snap" instead of "data" or "variable" or w/e
[12:39:23] <freezo> you mean I can change snap to data or variable?
[12:41:34] <robertmaxrees> or you can refer to that name
[12:41:37] <robertmaxrees> either/or
[12:59:27] <taplar_lunch> mmm tuna
[12:59:33] <taplar_lunch> convo died, eh?
[13:18:37] <GJ> Hello everyone... here is my code... https://pastebin.com/40XLVsPP --- I want to replace the &source="year" with "year" refering to the class id that called it...
[13:19:16] <GJ> So if I run it from #make, it should be source="make"
[13:20:03] <taplar_lunch> i think window.location.hash would be that #make
[13:21:18] <taplar_lunch> wait wait
[13:21:33] <taplar_lunch> are you talking about the id of the element you bound on?
[13:24:21] <GJ> yes teplar... Im going to do... $("#year, #make, #model").autocomplete({
[13:24:54] <GJ> So I want what field Im on in my receiving function
[13:24:57] <taplar> inside your source method, console.log(this.id)
[13:27:11] <GJ> taplar: undefined
[13:27:27] <taplar> where exactly did you put the console log?
[13:27:36] <taplar> on line 5?
[13:27:41] <GJ> data: $('#form_standard').serialize()+'&source="'+console.log(this.id)+'"',
[13:27:53] <taplar> lol, no dude
[13:28:01] <taplar> put the console log on line 5, before the ajax
[13:28:24] <taplar> console log writes to your browser console so you can see what something is
[13:28:36] <GJ> I need to send it to the ajax...
[13:28:36] <taplar> you're familiar, yes?
[13:28:48] <taplar> we're debugging and learning man
[13:29:27] <GJ> I just need to pass the text to the ajax
[13:29:38] <taplar> i know what you said you need
[13:29:52] <taplar> i'm trying to get you to console log the value so you can see if that is what you need
[13:30:21] <taplar> it's a teaching room.  not a solutions room
[13:31:44] <GJ> nothing is returned....
[13:31:52] <GJ> again, undefined
[13:31:58] <taplar> in the console it's undefined?
[13:32:43] <GJ> it doesn't show in console
[13:33:13] <taplar> if you put it before the ajax then it would execute that before the ajax is made
[13:34:20] <taplar> which it is undefined, interesting
[13:34:21] <GJ> the code you gave me does not cause the log to show
[13:34:50] <GJ> (granted... the code had no "," or ";"
[13:35:46] <GJ> nope, definately returning undefined
[13:36:15] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b1x6yzL3/
[13:36:27] <taplar> so you have to go down through some structure to get to the element
[13:37:12] <GJ> still undefined
[13:37:16] <taplar> no it's not
[13:37:27] <taplar> if you crack open your console and type something in the input, the id shows up
[13:37:30] <GJ> well, javascript disagreees with you
[13:37:38] <taplar> my browser disagrees with you
[13:37:52] <GJ> thats fine, but when its in the autocomplete source it returns undefined
[13:38:03] <taplar> not in that fiddle
[13:39:42] <taplar> https://i.imgur.com/2kDXCOD.png
[13:40:11] <GJ> https://imgur.com/a/ewD9z
[13:40:32] <taplar> gl then man
[13:40:42] <GJ> also, the undefined counts as I type
[13:41:40] <freezo> how to print out data if data is like this ? --> https://jsfiddle.net/g7m2tevv/5/
[13:41:50] <freezo> no --> =
[13:41:56] <freezo> just --> :
[13:42:00] <taplar> that's not valid
[13:42:04] <taplar> you have to use =
[13:42:10] <taplar> for variable assignment like that
[13:49:16] <GJ> taplar: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28656478/pass-input-id-to-url-in-jquery-ui-autocomplete
[13:49:19] <GJ> solution
[13:49:23] <GJ> thanks though :)
[13:50:21] <taplar> how's that going to work?
[13:50:40] <taplar> you said your autocomplete was $('selector1, selector2, selector3').autocomplete()
[13:51:44] <taplar> oh, the answer is initializing them one at a time
[13:52:00] <taplar> -_-, given my fiddle that's a less than optimal solution.
[13:52:26] <taplar> anyone else in the room alive to look at my fiddle and confirm that i'm not crazy that it's printing the id?
[13:53:55] <MikeD_> i am aline
[13:53:57] <MikeD_> alive
[13:54:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/b1x6yzL3/ type something in the input, you see the id print in the console?
[13:55:06] <MikeD_> yes
[13:55:14] <taplar> ty
[13:55:26] <GJ> taplar, the code in the post gives the wrong ID
[13:55:27] <GJ> lol
[13:55:33] <GJ> The post I sent
[13:56:33] <GJ> your code works
[13:57:06] <taplar> so you can use that logic to get the id for the url
[13:58:09] <GJ> taplar: thanks... that was it!
[13:58:22] <taplar> good deal
[13:58:39] <GJ> much easier solution then the one I gave you
[14:54:27] <robertmaxrees> https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/13160/5137035/2cEwP5W8uK0kpoW/Screenshot_20171117-000552.png
[14:55:14] <taplar> lol, i'm not sure why the pictures are going towards enlightment
[14:55:25] <robertmaxrees> (that's the joke)
[14:55:32] <robertmaxrees> it's totally backwards.
[14:55:36] <taplar> heh, k
[14:55:56] <robertmaxrees> just reminded me of all the times we get, like, screenshots of the console and stuff.
[14:56:09] <taplar> totally
[14:56:55] <taplar> i'm currently in a "discussion" with this guy  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47357681/calculate-corner-positions-of-rectangle-positions-with-javascript
[14:57:28] <taplar> "it works for what I want..... but what about this other thing?"  *angry face*
[15:00:03] <robertmaxrees> yikes.  what's with people doing shit like that?
[15:00:18] <taplar> idk
[15:00:48] <taplar> depending on how he comes back i may just delete the answer and vote for too broad
[15:01:11] <taplar> he's like a business user asking for things, :D
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[15:07:10] <taplar> yep
[15:35:53] <Tesagk> Looking for some help to figure this out. I'm trying to make my website more responsive. So, I've taken tesagk.com/index2.html and figured out the best way to display its format on a smaller screen. In the CSS, I'm using the @media queries. However, I really wanted a Hamburger Menu, which would involve some JQuery in order to properly show and hide elements.
[15:36:19] <Tesagk> I sort of brought it over in bulk, and I'm not sure why it's refusing to work, but I'm sure I screwed something up. Here's the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/bk8wb8g0/
[15:36:43] <taplar> when you say responsive, you're not referring to performant, right?
[15:38:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bk8wb8g0/1/  included jQuery
[15:38:48] <taplar> so what's not working?
[15:40:42] <Tesagk> Both the hamburger and cross icons appear at the same time
[15:40:53] <Tesagk> Making it impossible to click on a specific one.
[15:41:11] <taplar> also as a side note, if you are using media queries, you don't -have- to use jquery to show/hide things
[15:41:20] <taplar> that's part of the draw of media queries
[15:41:33] <taplar> you can makes rules that only take effect for certain situations
[15:41:38] <Tesagk> And now, for some reason, it does appear, though not like it's supposed to.
[15:41:47] <Tesagk> But I think that's in the css for me to edit.
[15:42:01] <Tesagk> Well, I needed JQuery for the hamburger menu
[15:42:06] <taplar> why?
[15:42:26] <taplar> media query for if the page width is less than X, have a rule to show it
[15:42:31] <Tesagk> Because it can show and hide elements and css can't?
[15:42:32] <taplar> otherwise have a rule to hide it
[15:42:37] <taplar> no...
[15:42:51] <Tesagk> I have the media query for showing the nav menu or not
[15:42:54] <taplar> again, heh, that's the point of media queries, conditional rules
[15:42:58] <Tesagk> The hamburger menu is in addition to that.
[15:43:16] <Tesagk> The code pen I checked out used JQuery. I dunno why.
[15:43:31] <taplar> people often use what is familiar to them
[15:44:32] <Tesagk> Oddly, the hamburger and cross buttons are set to 0,0 absolute, but they're on the right side of the screen, in between the menu and the header.
[15:44:42] <taplar> i would probably give #css a chance to talk you into how to use media queries to do as much of this show/hide work for you as you can
[15:47:27] <buzzluigiyear> I'm trying to get the values in the elements: option (1), div name (NAME) and div price (Free) but it's not working: https://jsfiddle.net/4jez0bka/
[15:47:30] <buzzluigiyear> it's showing like the objects
[15:48:08] <Tesagk> So you think I should do it in CSS, not JQuery?
[15:48:18] <Tesagk> I mean, I'm trying to learn JQuery to begin with, so...
[15:48:25] <taplar> as much as possible, in regards to what shows depending on browser width, yes
[15:48:34] <taplar> buzzluigiyear: that's not how you use find
[15:49:06] <taplar> buzzluigiyear: just give find the class selector, and then off of that get the .val()
[15:49:24] <taplar> well, actually those are not inputs...
[15:50:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4jez0bka/1/
[16:24:00] <buzzluigiyear> taplar, thank you!!!
[16:24:12] <taplar> np
[17:11:37] <neptude> Can anyone help me think of a reason why jQuery can select one element by ID but not another? It's a unique ID, my script is running I've tested with an .on('click') method on an adjacent element and was able to log a message but for some reason this element just won't select
[17:11:58] <taplar> hit us
[17:12:22] <neptude> I'd paste it but it's a super convoluted Wordpress thing on a friends site
[17:12:31] <taplar> can't really help much then
[17:12:33] <neptude> I'll just paste it
[17:12:36] <neptude> One sec
[17:12:38] <taplar> we just need a condensed version
[17:12:48] <taplar> and for clarity, you are saying that the id is not repeated on elements, yes?
[17:13:04] <neptude> I did a ctrl + F and returned only one result
[17:13:11] <neptude> in inspector
[17:13:21] <otahak> so... does JSfiddle not allow alert() anymore?
[17:13:55] <taplar> otahak: does for me
[17:14:06] <otahak> well, maybe you can help me figure out why such a simple script (https://jsfiddle.net/pns7xwc1/) wont fire
[17:14:48] <taplar> you're not including jQuery
[17:15:01] <otahak> ohh. I thought I simply put it in the sidebar on the left.
[17:15:15] <taplar> no, click the javascript <cog> part in the bottom left window
[17:15:51] <taplar> frameworks and extensions, jsfiddle has some readily available for quick includes
[17:16:57] <otahak> second question, then. https://jsfiddle.net/pns7xwc1/4/ - why arent I getting the val() of #type?
[17:17:18] <robertmaxrees> otahak you are
[17:17:23] <robertmaxrees> you're getting the value from pageload.
[17:17:27] <robertmaxrees> and then saving that
[17:17:30] <taplar> ^
[17:17:52] <otahak> but. why?
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> $('#type').val(); returns a string.
[17:18:06] <robertmaxrees> not a function call.
[17:18:12] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever the value is when the code runs.
[17:18:17] <otahak> thats what I thought
[17:18:23] <otahak> so type something into the input field. it still returns blank
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:18:30] <taplar> lol
[17:18:31] <otahak> ..why?
[17:18:32] <robertmaxrees> welkl, no.
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> again.
[17:18:40] * taplar is dieing
[17:18:43] <robertmaxrees> .va() returns a string.
[17:18:48] <robertmaxrees> follow so far?
[17:19:03] <robertmaxrees> so on pageload, the .val() of the input is '' (an empty string)
[17:19:16] <otahak> but Im not asking for pageload val() - Im asking for on.click() val.
[17:19:17] <robertmaxrees> that variable doesn't magically update when you type into that field.
[17:19:23] <robertmaxrees> nop
[17:19:37] <robertmaxrees> var req = $('#type').val(); means "give me the current value of #type right now"
[17:19:45] <robertmaxrees> you're referencing it in the click handler.
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> but you're grabbing the value on pageload.
[17:19:55] <otahak> OH
[17:20:02] * otahak facepalms
[17:20:04] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:20:05] <otahak> right.
[17:20:06] <taplar> :D
[17:20:10] <otahak> because its defined upfront, not in the click
[17:20:12] <otahak> cos im a dumbass.
[17:20:14] <otahak> lol thanks.
[17:20:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:20:26] <taplar> i think it's been a long day for most of us
[17:20:31] <robertmaxrees> and nah, you're not a dumbass ;)
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^ what taplar said.
[17:20:52] <otahak> lol I just havent JS'ed in a while
[17:21:00] <otahak> thanks again folks.
[17:21:01] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)
[17:21:46] <neptude> Here's my paste. This code won't log anything but if I use the same method with any nearby div, it will. I can store the value of an input and log it (with var getInput = $('[name="nf-field-7"]');) so I have no idea whats going on.
[17:21:54] <neptude> Here's the paste
[17:21:55] <neptude> https://pastebin.com/raw/0EMQLX8c
[17:22:28] <robertmaxrees> neptude your elements don't exist by the time your js runs.
[17:22:43] <robertmaxrees> either need to move that script tag after your markup, or use a doc realy.
[17:22:59] <taplar> realy
[17:23:04] <robertmaxrees> lel
[17:23:07] <robertmaxrees> *ready
[17:23:10] <otahak> lulz
[17:23:37] <robertmaxrees> neptude make sense?
[17:23:47] <neptude> Yeah that does
[17:24:07] <neptude> I guess I don't understand why I can log the element without a doc ready
[17:24:26] <taplar> your browser processes the page top down
[17:24:35] <taplar> when it hit some script, it runs
[17:24:37] <robertmaxrees> neptude could you clarify?
[17:24:52] <taplar> if that script looks for something created further down the page, it won't exist yet
[17:24:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by "log the element"?
[17:25:18] <taplar> oh i thought he said 'cant'
[17:26:09] <neptude> if I store it in a variable like this `var ninjaForm = $('[name="nf-field-7"]');` and add `console.log(ninjaform);`, it prints my element
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> try console.log(ninjaform.length)
[17:26:28] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[17:26:37] <neptude> one sec
[17:28:11] <neptude> https://imgur.com/a/kJXsF
[17:28:15] <neptude> That
[17:28:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[17:28:31] <robertmaxrees> that's not the element.
[17:28:36] <neptude> Whaaaaa
[17:28:40] <taplar> length: 0
[17:28:53] <robertmaxrees> ^&
[17:28:55] <taplar> $() always returns a jQuery object, even on nothing found
[17:29:02] <neptude> well dang
[17:29:05] <robertmaxrees> it's an empty jquery object.
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> make sense? :)
[17:29:39] <neptude> Now it does
[17:30:01] <neptude> I guess I was expecting undefined or some error
[17:30:15] <taplar> It's less error checking if it silently ignores not founds
[17:30:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:30:24] <robertmaxrees> protects you from yourself.
[17:30:46] <neptude> Gotcha
[17:31:15] <neptude> so doc ready is where I go next
[17:31:24] <robertmaxrees> well, maybe
[17:31:41] <robertmaxrees> what's with the custom tags?
[17:32:04] <neptude> It's a friends parent's site. Some hacked together Wordpress plugin nightmare
[17:32:18] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> so long as those aren't getting transformed by some frontend lib, then yeah, try a doc ready.
[17:53:19] <robertmaxrees> sleeeeepy.
[17:54:06] <taplar> wurd
[17:57:36] <taplar> i thought of a pretty good lewis black joke the other day
[17:58:08] <taplar> idk if they play in cali, but have you heard the radio commercial with the teacher, and she's calling role, and all the kids are sick or whatnot?
[17:58:26] <taplar> and at the end she's like "oh boy, it's going to be a day"
[17:59:04] <robertmaxrees> I don't listen to much radio these days heh.
[17:59:21] <taplar> well she says it in this sorta jovial, oh well, type of voice
[17:59:44] <taplar> and I just imagined lewis keying off of it and being like
[17:59:54] <taplar> Of course it's going to be a day ........... What else would it be?
[18:00:06] <taplar> If it's not a day .............. then you'd bE DEAD!!!
[18:00:20] <neptude> I read that in his voice
[18:00:24] <taplar> yep, :D
[18:00:36] <taplar> the end of course you have to do with violent shaking and a finger point
[18:01:28] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahahaha
[18:06:25] <neptude> And he does that nixonian angry jowl shake
[18:17:58] <neptude> Ok now doc ready failed and event delegation isn't working either
[18:18:20] <Tesagk> Currently, at tesagk.com if a content section is active, the corresponding button doesn't appear different. I'm still figuring out JQuery, but here's the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/q0nv0Lfo/
[18:18:24] <robertmaxrees> mind showing your code neptude?
[18:18:40] <Tesagk> I don't understand why "this" doesn't refer to the navTab or navLink that called it.
[18:19:00] <neptude> np one sec
[18:19:12] <Tesagk> I know if I can add a class to the corresponding button that I can then use CSS to show it as active.
[18:19:12] <robertmaxrees> Tesagk erm, your handler seems... odd.
[18:19:40] <Tesagk> What's odd about it?
[18:20:04] <robertmaxrees>  $('.navTab, .navLinks').on('click', '.navTab, .tabLink', function() {
[18:20:17] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any .navTab elements that are children.
[18:20:55] <Tesagk>         <button class="tabLink" data-attr="Home">             Home         </button>
[18:21:05] <Tesagk> Those are all in navTab
[18:21:12] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[18:21:18] <robertmaxrees> what do you think that delegated handler is doing?
[18:21:41] <Tesagk> Right now, it's allowing me to switch between which div I want to show on the page.
[18:21:50] <robertmaxrees> not the callback
[18:21:53] <robertmaxrees> the binding itself.
[18:22:14] <Tesagk> Identifying the button that was clicked
[18:22:26] <robertmaxrees> there are no child .navTab elements though.
[18:22:37] <robertmaxrees> at least, they're not children of .navTab or .navLinks
[18:22:58] <Tesagk> The buttons aren't children of navTab?
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:23:09] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[18:23:23] <Tesagk> Because I can inherit from them
[18:23:43] <robertmaxrees> you realize it's $(parent).on('event', 'child', right?
[18:23:59] <Tesagk> -Ish, I'm still figuring JQuery out
[18:24:12] <neptude> Here's my code: https://pastebin.com/raw/44WW34uJ
[18:24:26] <taplar> lol
[18:24:32] <taplar> sameish problem
[18:24:41] <neptude> me?
[18:24:45] <Tesagk> So I could probably get rid of the second navTab
[18:24:45] <taplar> yep
[18:24:47] <neptude> lol
[18:25:00] <taplar> $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, eventHandler)
[18:25:08] <neptude> eff
[18:25:12] <taplar> you're using the same selector for the parent and child
[18:25:17] <neptude> I use jQuery just enough to forget how to use it
[18:25:38] <taplar> you're also repeating the same ids for the binding ...
[18:25:41] <Tesagk> What element does "this" reference? Parent or child?
[18:25:49] <Tesagk> I am
[18:25:55] <taplar> neptude:  is
[18:25:57] <neptude> me
[18:26:06] <Tesagk> The ID of the button matches the ID of the content.
[18:26:33] <taplar> Tesagk: i'm looking at neptude 's code.  robert's gotcha, ;)
[18:26:58] <Tesagk> I think Robert went to the bathroom or something :P
[18:26:58] <robertmaxrees> Tesagk the child element.
[18:27:06] <robertmaxrees> i was talking with a coworker.
[18:27:13] * Tesagk grins.
[18:27:16] <Tesagk> Or that.
[18:27:26] <robertmaxrees> but $(this) refers to the element that emitted the event.,
[18:27:34] <Tesagk> So this is = to .tabLink
[18:27:37] <Tesagk> Oh
[18:27:50] <robertmaxrees> yeah. .tablink in your case.
[18:27:53] <Tesagk> To its ID you mean?
[18:28:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?  id?  it's just the child element you specify in that second param.
[18:29:41] <Tesagk> You said that $(this) references the element that emitted the event.
[18:29:51] <robertmaxrees> sorry, that was a bad definition.
[18:30:12] <Tesagk> Because, however this works: $('#' + $(this).data('attr')).addClass('active');
[18:30:23] <Tesagk> It's adding "active" to the appropriate content div.
[18:30:34] <robertmaxrees> $(this) would be the .tabLink that was clicked.
[18:30:39] <Tesagk> All of the button IDs have corresponding content divs with the same IDs.
[18:31:17] <robertmaxrees> what IDs are you talking about?
[18:31:25] <Tesagk> So, what I want to do is just add "active" to the button that's clicked. So that it can have a different style
[18:31:37] <Tesagk> Oh, er
[18:31:42] <Tesagk> The data-attr matches the ID
[18:31:45] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[18:32:04] <robertmaxrees> and you can just do $(this).addClass('someclasshere') to add it to the clicked button
[18:32:51] <Tesagk> And I would just do $('.tabLink').removeClass()
[18:32:58] <Tesagk> At the beginning
[18:33:00] <Tesagk> to clear it?
[18:33:10] <robertmaxrees> erm, .removeClass() won't do anything on its own.
[18:33:12] <robertmaxrees> but I'
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> *i'd just do $('.thatClassName').removeClass('thatClassName')
[18:33:38] <robertmaxrees> though that can be heavy-handed depending on what exactly the name is.
[18:37:10] <Tesagk> Thanks for the patience, Robert.
[18:37:16] <robertmaxrees> Absolutely :)
[18:37:20] <robertmaxrees> s'what we're here for.
[18:37:42] <Tesagk> Now I just have to figure out how I broke my responsive design, but that's a css issue I think.
[18:37:56] <robertmaxrees> you're doing some strange things on load with jquery fwiw.
[18:47:00] <neptude> Alright, I've tested this in codepen and it works just fine but won't on my local. Trying a less convoluted element in the same form for my own readability. I am really missing something
[18:47:04] <neptude> https://pastebin.com/raw/wTb5g8kR
[18:47:09] <oojacoboo> How would I go about inserting a DOM with `after`, and then targeting it?
[18:47:18] <oojacoboo> DOM node*
[18:47:33] <taplar> what do you mean targeting it oojacoboo?
[18:47:43] <oojacoboo> taplar selecting it, finding it, etc.
[18:47:47] <robertmaxrees> neptude you're not using a doc ready there.
[18:47:52] <taplar> why do that?  you already have it
[18:47:54] <robertmaxrees> neptude add one and you're good to go.
[18:48:03] <oojacoboo> taplar I need to `remove` it
[18:48:13] <taplar> immediately, or do you mean later?
[18:48:25] <oojacoboo> within a conditional statement, but later, yea
[18:48:36] <taplar> then you just need to know the selector to get it
[18:48:47] <taplar> it'll be in the DOM available to be found like any other element
[18:48:50] <oojacoboo> well, that's not working :/
[18:48:56] <taplar> fiddle then
[18:49:07] <oojacoboo> I'll play more I guess
[18:49:09] <robertmaxrees> neptude you see what I said?
[18:49:13] <oojacoboo> that was the first thing I tried...
[18:49:36] <neptude> Yeah, just tried it. Nothing
[18:49:42] <robertmaxrees> neptude erm.
[18:49:48] <robertmaxrees> mind showing what you're trying?
[18:49:51] <neptude> Sure
[18:49:54] <robertmaxrees> with the doc ready.
[18:50:18] <taplar> oojacoboo: one question. so you're doing $(something).after(newGuy) right?
[18:50:37] <oojacoboo> taplar yes, within a select.on('change') event
[18:50:46] <taplar> so then later how are you trying to find him?
[18:50:48] <oojacoboo> with a nested condition
[18:51:12] <oojacoboo> I tried creating the DOM node with $() and targeting the var, and I also tried a standard jq selector
[18:51:27] <taplar> i mean, are you expecting newGuy to be a child of something?
[18:51:44] <oojacoboo> no
[18:51:52] <taplar> k, double checking
[18:51:59] <oojacoboo> I just have a conditional statement with the select to add an alert or remove it based on the value
[18:52:03] <oojacoboo> pretty simple really
[18:52:38] <oojacoboo> I thought the selector would work, then thought maybe it wouldn't be it was being injected into the DOM
[18:52:47] <neptude> https://pastebin.com/raw/C2U388fY
[18:52:48] <oojacoboo> my jq skills are a little rusty :(
[18:52:52] <taplar> doesn't matter.  selectors find anything in the dom
[18:52:57] <taplar> doesn't matter how they got there
[18:53:04] <oojacoboo> taplar okay, must have been a typo - will dig, thanks
[18:53:32] <robertmaxrees> neptude any console errors on your site?
[18:53:55] <oojacoboo> taplar https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ce906a6948f101addcab37b1d7b6f3c8
[18:54:28] <oojacoboo> that does not work
[18:54:33] <taplar> oh snap
[18:54:35] <neptude> Nothing when clicking no, here's a screenshot
[18:54:36] <neptude> https://imgur.com/a/DHDeY
[18:54:41] <taplar> no dude, you're removeing your select from your page
[18:54:59] <taplar> $(this).after($businessRequiredAlert); <--
[18:54:59] <oojacoboo> huh?
[18:55:01] <robertmaxrees> neptude wait - what versiopn of jquery are you using?
[18:55:08] <oojacoboo> taplar that adds the span
[18:55:10] <neptude> 1.12.4
[18:55:10] <oojacoboo> after it
[18:55:17] <taplar> that says take the 'this' and put it after the businessRequiredAlert, but that business Required Alert is not on your page
[18:55:21] <robertmaxrees> neptude because https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/20cs4usj/1/
[18:55:30] <oojacoboo> taplar that part works fine taplar
[18:55:38] <taplar> i don't see how
[18:55:48] <taplar> i don't see where you are putting the businessRequiredAlert on the page
[18:55:56] <oojacoboo> after the select
[18:55:57] <robertmaxrees> neptude https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/20cs4usj/3/ try doing this.
[18:56:03] <robertmaxrees> specifically, that console log.
[18:56:08] <taplar> ???
[18:56:48] <oojacoboo> taplar maybe I'm misunderstanding the docs, but it says `after` will insert a DOM node after the jq object's DOM node
[18:56:56] <oojacoboo> which it does properly
[18:57:05] <taplar> right, but the element you are inserting after is not on the page
[18:57:09] <neptude> trying
[18:57:16] <taplar> $('html') doesn't automatically attach something to the page
[18:57:23] <taplar> you have to later append that to the page
[18:57:50] <taplar> if I do: var x = $('<div>');
[18:57:52] <oojacoboo> which `after` is doing
[18:58:01] <taplar> that x contains a jQuery element that contains the div
[18:58:04] <taplar> but it's not on the page
[18:58:05] <neptude> Logs 0
[18:58:09] <oojacoboo> right taplar
[18:58:13] <robertmaxrees> neptude heh.
[18:58:16] <neptude> Right?
[18:58:17] <robertmaxrees> then the element doesn't exist yet.
[18:58:18] <taplar> later if I insert something after x, it will be after x, but not on the page as well
[18:58:26] <robertmaxrees> neptude that means something else is creating the element.
[18:58:31] <neptude> I hate this site
[18:58:36] <oojacoboo> taplar what do you mean by "not on the page"?
[18:58:44] <taplar> not in the DOM
[18:58:50] <taplar> it only exists in that variable
[18:58:53] <neptude> Is event delegation my last option?
[18:58:57] <oojacoboo> well, I see it working taplar
[18:59:05] <oojacoboo> that's certainly not the issue I'm having
[18:59:19] <taplar> then can you update the gist to show where the element is being appended to the page?
[18:59:36] <oojacoboo> taplar see `$(this).after($businessRequiredAlert);`
[18:59:46] <taplar> that's the part that is concerning me
[18:59:51] <oojacoboo> that adds it after the select
[18:59:53] <oojacoboo> which works
[19:00:00] <taplar> robertmaxrees: am i being dumb here?
[19:00:12] <neptude> This may have something to do with it
[19:00:13] <neptude> https://stackoverflow.com/a/45461147/1973400
[19:00:41] <taplar> unless i got after() and insertAfter() mixed up.
[19:00:44] * taplar runs to the docs
[19:00:49] <oojacoboo> taplar aliases
[19:01:25] <taplar> yeah i got them mixed up, nvm
[19:01:40] <taplar> it's putting the second variable after the first, so my bad
[19:01:40] <neptude> VICTORY
[19:02:02] <robertmaxrees> neptude heh, that's why i was asking about those forms earlier.
[19:02:06] <neptude> Thanks for all the hand holding
[19:02:08] <oojacoboo> taplar the issue is in the else statement for the condition, it's not selecting that span
[19:02:22] <taplar> that you created on line 2?
[19:02:54] <neptude> I should pay more attention to help :D
[19:03:21] <taplar> Just so I'm clear.  You're opening the page, then choosing option "Natural Person", see the thing appear
[19:03:25] <oojacoboo> taplar seems the issue is somewhere else.  It's working for some of the values in the select, but not the one I was testing
[19:03:28] <taplar> you then change it from that value and it doesn't disappear?
[19:03:44] <oojacoboo> I suspect the triple equal could be an issue
[19:03:54] <taplar> values are strings
[19:04:08] <oojacoboo> sure, and triple equal is a good practice
[19:04:20] <taplar> ya so that shouldn't be the issue
[19:04:25] <oojacoboo> it's not
[19:04:28] <taplar> is my previous statement about the flow true?
[19:05:05] <oojacoboo> taplar yes, it's not working for one of the other options in the same optgroup
[19:05:15] <oojacoboo> but it's working for all others in another optgroup
[19:06:08] <taplar> can you console log the 'this.value' before the if else and see what it is on the second select change?
[19:06:27] <oojacoboo> yea, I'll check that out
[19:07:43] <oojacoboo> syntax error :/
[19:07:56] <taplar> what did you put in there?
[19:08:07] <robertmaxrees> sorry, last day pre merge-freeze.  getting kinda battyu.
[19:08:19] <oojacoboo> ugh, it's popping in another field where the label selector is wrong
[19:08:20] <robertmaxrees> still need me to looka t something?
[19:08:25] <taplar> nah
[19:08:28] <oojacoboo> thanks taplar for talking through it
[19:08:31] <robertmaxrees> rad
[19:08:32] <taplar> i had after and insertAfter backwards
[19:08:38] <robertmaxrees> y'all are smarter than I am, anyway
[19:08:45] <taplar> phss
[19:09:06] <taplar> oojacoboo: you find something?
[19:09:09] <oojacoboo> taplar $form.find("label[for=le-birth-date").text("Birth Date");
[19:09:12] <oojacoboo> that'll do it
[19:09:16] <oojacoboo> note the missing `]`
[19:09:21] <taplar> yup
[19:09:47] <taplar> so was is some other code was causing an error that just shutdown your js?
[19:09:58] <oojacoboo> some other code, yep
[19:10:02] <taplar> hah
[19:10:03] <oojacoboo> from another file
[19:10:10] <oojacoboo> it happens :)
[19:10:19] <taplar> with that, my azz is going home
[19:10:26] <oojacoboo> cheers!
[19:10:38] <taplar> happy holidays all
[19:19:51] <neptude> cheers
[20:42:06] <buzzluigiyear> In an iFrame, how do I get an event when the window resizes?
[21:46:19] <deitarion> I have an AJAX-loaded slideDown() and I'm trying to use iframe srcdoc to provide an extra layer of sandboxing on a rich text field within the loaded data but slideDown() and my "expand the iframe to fit its content" script are tripping over each other. What order of operations should I perform to make sure both are working from the right calculated heights?
[21:47:40] <deitarion> (The iframe stuff works perfectly if the page is loaded at the top level, but there's a race condition that leaves my current efforts with an iframe height of 0 most of the time.)
[21:49:08] <deitarion> Basically, what I need to know is how to wire things together so that my code calculates a correct iframe height before the expander slides open, then have slideDown() determine the desired target height after that.
[21:59:29] <deitarion> I know it's a race condition because I sometimes also get a height of 8.
[22:16:30] <aro> if i have an iframe that takes up 100% of the visible window, and i am scrolled to the bottom of that page, how do i make it scroll to the top? this iframe also has an overlay with a loaded modal in it
[22:23:56] <aro> i got it :) had to use $('html,body').contents().animate({});
[23:35:02] <deitarion> Never mind. I'll defer that change until I have proper time to pick it apart and figure out why I'm getting a `null` body from a .ready() iframe.
