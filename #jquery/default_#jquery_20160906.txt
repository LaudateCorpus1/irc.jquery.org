[02:42:12] <Ryneveld> http://pastebin.com/3ppfNYfL  Meant to show when a div is hovered over, and dissapear after the user removes the hover. It works, but it's awfully glitchy and sometimes the div just loops back and forth going up and down. What can I do to fix this
[04:38:00] <newer_> I am using the browser inspector to copy the "Unique selector"
[04:45:41] <Cork> newer_: ok, you have a question to go with that?
[04:49:32] <slax0r> Cork: nah, just braggin'
[05:02:00] <newer_> Cork: yes, sorry
[05:02:19] <newer_> I am doing jQuery(id).css({background-image: url("paper.gif")})
[05:02:27] <newer_> and I am getting: SyntaxError: missing : after property id
[05:02:35] <newer_> any help? Sorry if its too basic
[05:03:08] <Cork> newer_: ({ 'background-image': 'url("paper.gif")' })
[05:03:20] <Cork> newer_: or ({ backgroundImage: 'url("paper.gif")' })
[05:03:35] <Cork> background-image isn't a valid js object key
[05:04:18] <Cork> newer_: that said, i would recommend moving the css into the css file and use a class here instead
[05:04:23] <Cork> like .addClass('paper')
[05:04:55] <Cork> and .paper { background-image: url(paper.gif"); }
[05:05:00] <Cork> opps
[05:05:03] <Cork> * and .paper { background-image: url(paper.gif); }
[05:34:41] <newer_> @Cork: many thanks
[05:34:58] <newer_> one more question
[05:35:28] <newer_> I have got a jQuery Object already created, and one of its childs is this one: <span data-original-title="" class="label-text" title="">Functional Element</span>
[05:35:32] <newer_> how can I get it?
[05:35:48] <newer_> I have tried object.child('label-text')
[05:36:00] <newer_> but havent been able to
[05:36:17] <Cork> you weant the content of title?
[05:36:17] <newer_> I have tried object.child('.label-text')
[05:36:22] <newer_> ok found, sorry for the noise
[05:36:33] <Cork> that would be .prop('title')
[06:29:09] <jacko876__> hello

[06:57:51] <Cork> jacobroufa: that's php not jquery...
[07:13:59] <hellyeah> hey
[07:14:07] <hellyeah> i want to get full dom of another web site
[07:14:13] <hellyeah> is that possible?
[07:14:53] <Cork> hellyeah: through two ways
[07:15:02] <hellyeah> hmm?
[07:15:09] <Cork> 1. if they allow it through a cors http header
[07:15:24] <Cork> or 2. by proxying the request to be called from your server
[07:16:05] <Cork> if none of those is possible, then no you can't
[07:16:16] <hellyeah> proxying the request
[07:16:23] <hellyeah> how can i do that?
[07:16:30] <hellyeah> is it dosable fromjquery?
[07:17:11] <hellyeah> how can i check "allow it through a core http header"?
[07:17:21] <Cork> hellyeah: $.ajax('/proxy.php=target-url')
[07:17:32] <Cork> and proxy.php makes a get_file_contents and returns the response
[07:17:48] <hellyeah> so this is not jquery thing?
[07:18:00] <Cork> hellyeah: if you make a request to the server it has to have a cross site origin header
[07:18:04] <Cork> allowing you or anyone
[07:18:12] <Cork> hellyeah: only if you run a javascript server
[07:18:17] <Cork> you can't do it from client
[07:18:23] <hellyeah> node.js
[07:18:28] <Cork> hense the "must be done from your server"
[07:19:21] <hellyeah> i wish it can be done simple with a jquery method
[07:19:34] <Cork> hellyeah: it could back in the late 90's
[07:19:43] <Cork> then they found you could do xss cause of it
[07:19:46] <Cork> and it got blocked
[07:19:51] <hellyeah> ic
[07:19:55] <Cork> if you from script can make calls to third party servers
[07:20:19] <Cork> it means you can get user info (password, address and the like) from any service you are logged into
[07:20:53] <hellyeah> got it
[07:21:30] <hellyeah> do you know about phantomjs btw?
[07:24:16] <hellyeah> anyway thanks
[07:28:20] <Cork> hellyeah: ya?
[07:28:35] <Cork> not that this is the channel for it though
[08:27:28] <obert> a way to show a tip under a menu?
[08:29:30] <obert> .tooltip() ?
[08:33:29] <hellyeah> obert:  do you use jquery ui tooltip
[08:33:40] <hellyeah> or what?
[08:33:51] <obert> nothing just jquery
[08:40:11] <obert> ...
[08:48:42] <hellyeah> obert:  jquery has jquery ui tab
[08:49:02] <hellyeah> do you have jsfiddle to show your code?
[08:50:37] <obert> I don't have code atm
[08:50:50] <obert> I need a sort of pop up to show a tip message under a menu
[08:51:10] <obert> tab seems to be not good for my case
[08:52:15] <obert> I would to show a tip to use left and right arrow under next and prev here http://obert.hostfree.pw/gallery.php
[08:58:33] <hellyeah> not tab sorry
[08:58:38] <hellyeah> jquery ui tooltip
[08:58:55] <hellyeah> check jquery ui tooltio example
[09:01:43] <obert> yeah perhaps it's ok but i need to include another library in my small site
[09:02:04] <obert> I hope there's something ready in pure jquery
[09:02:22] <obert> thanks for now
[09:04:02] <hellyeah> i dont think there is something in jquery
[09:04:11] <hellyeah> but i can give you some idea if you want
[09:04:21] <obert> like?
[09:04:29] <hellyeah> let me write it down
[09:05:51] <hellyeah> you can do a div and state the position when you hover over the main div you can add "css class" like display:block when you mouse not hovering the element you can remove the class so in that way you can show some div as tooltip.
[09:06:05] <hellyeah> you could write it from scratch
[09:06:22] <hellyeah> sec
[09:06:38] <obert> the css way?
[09:06:58] <obert> I made a sort of tooltip in css but it was not very fancy
[09:09:28] <obert> with display: none and block
[09:12:51] <Deusdeorum> i have used this to hide a cell in a table $('tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(2)').hide();
[09:13:15] <Deusdeorum> but that removes borders, obviously, how can I add borders to a hidden cell again?
[09:13:43] <hellyeah> obert:  you can think with this logic https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/4a2qcsg2/
[09:14:00] <hellyeah> css way is your friend
[09:14:36] <hellyeah> obert:  using toggleClass can be wiser in that situtation https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/4a2qcsg2/1/
[09:14:56] <hellyeah> i am sure you can do  some improvements with that idea
[09:15:18] <hellyeah> Deacyde: do you have jsfiddle
[09:15:23] <hellyeah> ?
[09:15:36] <Deusdeorum> was ^ for me? :p
[09:16:05] <hellyeah> Demonen:  i think you did wrong you jsut hide td
[09:16:18] <hellyeah> you have to find a way to reach the text and hide it
[09:17:04] <Deusdeorum> yes, that is what i wanted, but there's so many tags of that radio button in that cell so i couldn't figure it out
[09:17:08] <hellyeah> Deusdeorum:  people in this channel ask for jsfiddle probably
[09:17:09] <Deusdeorum> guess that is what i want to do
[09:17:34] <hellyeah> td-child(2).text() or something will work?
[09:17:45] <hellyeah> btw
[09:17:48] <obert> I will try something thanks helllen
[09:17:52] <obert> hellyeah:
[09:18:35] <Deusdeorum> i'd more like to hide contents inside a tr and td
[09:19:59] <RilaX> hello
[09:20:28] <RilaX> i need some help whith a jquery plugin
[09:20:42] <RilaX> is there anyone who could help me ?
[09:41:05] <shoky_> not with that description
[09:42:05] <RilaX> I guess
[09:42:35] <RilaX> i can explain my problem
[09:42:51] <RilaX> english is not my natural language
[09:43:31] <RilaX> so i'm developpingg a tool for my work using php, sql and a bit of jquery
[09:44:14] <RilaX> My php code get the data from a sql table, and create a html table
[09:44:43] <RilaX> I use dynatable to rendre this table and use its function
[09:44:55] <shoky_> a jsfiddle showing your jquery problem is usually the best
[09:45:01] <RilaX> but i encounter some difficulties to mak a subtotal
[09:45:48] <hellyeah> hey
[09:45:48] <RilaX> jsfiddle here I come (for the first time)
[09:47:24] <hellyeah> hm
[09:48:44] <RilaX> how do i link to external plugin in jsfiddle ?
[09:49:07] <RilaX> I think I've found
[09:49:20] <hellyeah> external resource
[09:55:35] <RilaX> that's not as easy as I thought
[09:59:22] <RilaX> Ok
[09:59:27] <RilaX> here ti is : https://jsfiddle.net/ue1vkudw/
[09:59:32] <RilaX> it*
[10:00:39] <RilaX> I'd just like to sum the montantDevis column
[10:00:54] <hellyeah> what is the problem?
[10:01:40] <RilaX> I'm working from this thread : https://github.com/alfajango/jquery-dynatable/issues/76
[10:02:02] <RilaX> and the problem is that records is undefined
[10:02:21] <RilaX> I don't get the structure of the object
[10:02:43] <hellyeah> you didnt include jquery file
[10:03:19] <hellyeah> (index):59 Uncaught TypeError: $myTable.bind(...).dynatable is not a function(anonymous function) @ (index):59dispatch @ jquery-2.1.3.js:4430elemData.handle @ jquery-2.1.3.js:4116
[10:03:35] <RilaX> I didn't find the link to past in jsfiddle, i did assume it was embeded
[10:03:51] <hellyeah> you see javascript in javascript panel
[10:03:54] <hellyeah> it is dropdown
[10:04:02] <hellyeah> you can select jquery 2.1.3 there
[10:05:11] <RilaX> thanks
[10:05:18] <RilaX> I had the jquery
[10:05:34] <RilaX> the plugin is functionning properly
[10:05:40] <RilaX> but not my script
[10:06:27] <RilaX> I am not able to initialize well my records variable
[10:10:30] <hellyeah> RilaX:  i guess you need to fix the problem first
[10:10:37] <hellyeah> (index):59 Uncaught TypeError: $myTable.bind(...).dynatable is not a function(anonymous function) @ (index):59dispatch @ jquery-2.1.3.js:4430elemData.handle @ jquery-2.1.3.js:4116
[10:10:39] <hellyeah> ops
[10:11:56] <RilaX> I don't understand how to fix it
[10:12:07] <RilaX> is telling me .bind() is not a function ?
[10:12:28] <RilaX> no, .dynatable is not a function
[10:12:42] <hellyeah> use .on()
[10:13:23] <hellyeah> that does look like event "dynatable:afterProcess"
[10:13:31] <hellyeah> what is that?
[10:13:38] <RilaX> I'm sorry, I don't get it
[10:13:42] <hellyeah> do you want to use delegate?
[10:13:54] <RilaX> what is delegate ?
[10:13:56] <hellyeah> something.on('event', function()
[10:14:11] <RilaX> as i said, i work from this thread : https://github.com/alfajango/jquery-dynatable/issues/76
[10:14:31] <hellyeah> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[10:14:52] <Cork> hellyeah: afterProcess is a scope
[10:15:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:15:02] <Cork> and dynatable is a custom event
[10:15:07] <hellyeah> ic
[10:17:07] <hellyeah> taplar:  will give all answers RilaX
[10:17:10] <taplar> RilaX: how you're trying to access 'records' is different from the github suggestion
[10:17:13] <hellyeah> ask him :D
[10:17:15] <taplar> :P
[10:17:24] <RilaX> yes I did tons of tests
[10:17:26] <taplar> i can't help much.  still busy, :)
[10:17:29] <RilaX> and it never worked
[10:17:37] <RilaX> I think i miss something
[10:18:00] <Cork> updated version https://jsfiddle.net/ue1vkudw/1/
[10:18:42] <hellyeah> length is undefined
[10:18:49] <Cork> i know
[10:18:52] <Cork> looking into it
[10:19:21] <Cork> that's weird...
[10:19:31] <Cork> they never set dynatable in the github issue...
[10:20:01] <Cork> RilaX: you know where that variable is suppose to come from?
[10:20:09] <Cork> cause it can't be from $myTable
[10:20:13] <ychaouche> hello #jquery. Can the $ function find elements that weren't there until I clicked somewhere ?
[10:20:14] <RilaX> sorry but no
[10:20:22] <RilaX> i think it's from the plugin
[10:20:37] <Cork> ychaouche: it finds elements that exists when the function runs
[10:20:47] <ychaouche> then I must have a problem
[10:20:49] <Cork> it doesn't modify the result later
[10:20:57] <ychaouche> the element is definitely there but it can't seem to find it
[10:21:29] <RilaX> I don't understand the point of declaring this dynatable variable and no assigning anything
[10:22:24] <Cork> RilaX: view-source:https//www.dynatable.com/
[10:22:30] <Cork> $('#text-transform-example').data('dynatable');
[10:23:18] <ychaouche> Cork: http://i.imgur.com/5nzyeRR.png
[10:23:38] <taplar> that's an id
[10:23:44] <taplar> id selectors start with #
[10:24:06] <ychaouche> taplar: first line
[10:24:34] <RilaX> I did an update, but still not working : https://jsfiddle.net/ue1vkudw/2/
[10:24:36] <ychaouche> also the GET line in the middle isn't a click, it's just a timer reload or something.
[10:24:56] <ychaouche> I already clicked to make the element appear before typing all the lines.
[10:25:53] <RilaX> is there a way to see the structure of the $myTable object ?
[10:26:16] <Cork> ychaouche: that's an id not a class
[10:26:31] <ychaouche> Cork: I searched by id in the first line
[10:26:37] <ychaouche> if you look closely
[10:27:02] <Cork> ychaouche: you need to provide a link or a reproducable example in jsfiddle.net
[10:27:05] <Cork> i can't debug images
[10:27:21] <Cork> RilaX: $myTable is just a jquery selection
[10:27:26] <Cork> it isn't what you want i think
[10:27:55] <RilaX> doesn't it have attributes or something ?
[10:28:07] <Cork> it does but what you want to access isn't attributes
[10:28:15] <RilaX> arg
[10:28:17] <Cork> it is related to the plugin that is referencing the table
[10:28:26] <RilaX> yes
[10:29:00] <Cork> RilaX: you never initiate the plugin btw
[10:29:18] <Cork> ugg sorry
[10:29:20] <Cork> yes you are
[10:29:26] <RilaX> I do whith the .dynatabel({ ...
[10:29:32] <Cork> ya
[10:29:36] <Cork> i just missed it
[10:30:04] <RilaX> I tried to initiate it earlier, seperatly it never change anything
[10:31:20] <RilaX> What I understand is that the plugin parse my table and create an object (?) which I should be able to work on
[10:31:48] <RilaX> but I must be wrong somewhere
[10:32:06] <Cork> RilaX: https://jsfiddle.net/ue1vkudw/4/ should work according to there site
[10:32:10] <Cork> not sure why it isn't
[10:32:33] <Cork> RilaX: yes and it should exist on $().data('dynatable') but there is nothing there
[10:32:35] <Cork> not sure why
[10:33:24] <RilaX> Maybe I should look for another plugin
[10:33:30] <RilaX> ?
[10:33:52] <RilaX> this one seems a litlle bit messy/buggy
[10:34:23] <Cork> the biggest problem seams to be documentation
[10:34:42] <Cork> if you take your time and read the documentation it might be just fine
[10:34:52] <Cork> (i haven't read the plugin so i can't say if it is good or not)
[10:35:05] <RilaX> I did read the whole documentation
[10:35:16] <RilaX> there's not much
[10:35:37] <RilaX> not more than the github post from 2013
[10:35:49] <Cork> aha
[10:36:02] <Cork> RilaX: afterProcess is too early to access records
[10:36:08] <Cork> it doesn't exist yet there
[10:36:45] <RilaX> isn't it why the author suggested to use .bind( ?
[10:36:47] <Cork> RilaX: https://jsfiddle.net/ue1vkudw/5/
[10:36:56] <Cork> no
[10:37:04] <Cork> that just means you bind the dynatable event
[10:37:16] <Cork> what i said is that event triggers too early
[10:37:30] <RilaX> okay
[10:37:58] <RilaX> I have to go to take my children from school
[10:38:13] <RilaX> I'll work on it again on thursday.
[10:38:22] <RilaX> thx a lot for the clue you gave me
[10:38:35] <RilaX> I have some investigations to do
[10:57:15] <ychaouche> Cork: the problem was : the element was in another frame
[10:57:37] <ychaouche> that was invisible to the bare eye (until right-click saw a "this frame" submenu)
[12:29:12] <catbadger> hey. has andyone had to get drag events from a transformable svg?
[12:29:15] <arosen12> Hi, I'm wondering why if I do:   $(".comment-input")[0].firstChild  I get: "@" but if I do: $(".comment-input")[0].children(); I get   [ "<span>foo</span>"]; why doesn't children() include the firstChild?
[12:29:45] <catbadger> wow
[12:29:49] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 could you show us a fiddle?
[12:30:05] <robertmaxrees> because something there seems really...strange.
[12:30:06] <taplar> do native Elements have a children() method?
[12:30:26] <robertmaxrees> they have a prop.
[12:30:28] <robertmaxrees> no method though.
[12:30:58] <taplar> [0] is going to break out of the jQuery object arosen12
[12:32:25] <arosen12> http://picpaste.com/pics/Screenshot_from_2016-09-06_09_31_58-ctgZzgle.1473179534.png
[12:32:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:32:52] <taplar> children != children()
[12:33:01] <robertmaxrees> also: text exists in nodes.
[12:33:15] <robertmaxrees> so the firstChild node is a textNode with the contents "@"
[12:33:33] <arosen12> why don't i see the text nodes? If i do $( $(".comment-input")[0]).children() i see the same thing as $(".comment-input)[0].children
[12:33:40] <taplar> contents() i believe
[12:33:49] <taplar> will get you all children, including text nodes
[12:33:51] <robertmaxrees> becuase jquery doesn't treat text nodes like other nodes.
[12:34:01] <robertmaxrees> this is why a fiddle would be nice :)
[12:34:23] <arosen12> ah okay let me try this with contents() and see if that does the trick for me. Thanks guys!
[12:34:31] <robertmaxrees> also: no need to do $( $(".comment-input")[0]) - you can just do $(".comment-input").eq(0)
[12:40:52] <catbadger> So I've got a transformable svg. When the path changes, I need an event. Anyone done this before? There seem to be no events for this/
[12:41:19] <robertmaxrees> catbadger you have code changing that path, right?
[12:44:36] <arosen12> I'm hitting this error: "Uncaught IndexSizeError: Failed to execute 'setStart' on 'Range': There is no child at offset 10." I'm trying to set the cursor position in a contenteditable after I insert a node into it.   I'm basically passing:  range.setStart( $($(el).contains())[1], setCursorPos);  Any ideas?
[12:45:42] <arosen12> the childnode I'm inserting has a length of 10 and gets inserted into the contenteditable before this code is run as well.
[12:45:55] <arosen12> i've also tried with smaller numbers than 10 just to double check
[12:46:17] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see a fiddle at this point.
[12:48:52] <catbadger> robertmaxrees yes
[12:49:10] <robertmaxrees> catbadger so then just call your code after you change the path.
[12:49:36] <catbadger> i need more coffee today :P
[12:49:55] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: okay I'll try and create one.
[12:50:10] <Ryneveld> http://pastebin.com/3ppfNYfL basic mousehover script, however it's a little glitchy if I quickly move my mouse over and off the div, is there a cleaner way to do this?
[12:50:39] <robertmaxrees> Ryneveld you need to .stop() the animations.
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/stop/
[12:52:00] <robertmaxrees> catbadger you're welcome :)
[12:52:53] <Ryneveld> ahh that made it work much better, thanks
[12:53:07] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[12:55:53] <hellyeah> taplar_:  hey are you busy again?
[12:56:02] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jva5jk75/
[12:56:10] <taplar_> lunch
[12:56:28] <hellyeah> launch :D
[12:56:33] <taplar_> and to be busy 'again' implies you stopped being busy at some point, ;)
[12:56:36] <hellyeah> or lunch :XD
[12:56:52] <hellyeah> you busy with lunch now
[12:57:05] <taplar_> and watching my pair keep coding
[12:57:14] <hellyeah> when you become busy with code, you are not busy with lunch
[12:57:15] <hellyeah> :D:D:D
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> that was weird.
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> any of you get a spam message from antipsychiatry?
[12:57:49] <taplar_> nope
[12:57:58] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[12:58:01] <hellyeah> who is that?
[12:58:06] <taplar_> are you hanging out in some other chatroom?
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> this channel.
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> dude joined, asked if i could share some link out to people, wouldn't tell me what the link is, then left.
[12:58:43] <hellyeah> why is anti?
[12:58:46] <taplar_> i was just wondering if they were reading the users list of another room you might have been in
[12:58:53] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> was a real dude, just unsolicited contacs.
[12:59:28] <mekhami> anyone super familiar with jquery DataTables that can help me understand how to create a filter for the table? I want my users to be able to filter the table based on a checkbox that affects one column in the table.
[13:00:03] <taplar_> the googs has some pages for "datatables, custom filters" i'm sure
[13:00:09] <taplar_> i know we've googled that before
[13:00:16] <mekhami> i've been googlign for a bit and i can't seem to find what i'm looking for...
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> and i stiiiiil haven't fooound what i'm looking fooooor.
[13:01:32] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: I left a comment describing the problem i'm hitting in the javascript section of that jsfiddle
[13:01:46] <robertmaxrees> ohter folks can help, to :)
[13:03:07] <hellyeah> i would like to get dom of a page
[13:03:19] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 looking now though.
[13:03:24] <hellyeah> like www.livescores.com i want to get dom elements
[13:03:30] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah wat
[13:03:31] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: awesome thanks :)
[13:03:55] <hellyeah> i want to get the dom
[13:04:01] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:06:43] <hellyeah> web scrapping
[13:06:56] <robertmaxrees> then you're not using jquery
[13:07:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you using?
[13:07:49] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 you realize that the range stuff isn't based off the raw text but on the nodes, right?
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> and it's all 0-indexed?
[13:08:02] <hellyeah> phantomJS
[13:08:15] <hellyeah> you can use js/jquery in the page.evaluate
[13:09:22] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* you also realize that scrapers are kind of a pain for the people running the sites you're targeting, right?  otherwise, check out ##javascript.,
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jva5jk75/2/
[13:12:33] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  ah okay i think that is where i was going wrong it was doing it based off the raw text. thanks.
[13:12:41] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 deffo.
[13:13:33] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  hrm though why can't it be: range.setEnd($("#test").contents().get(1), 2);    the 2 is out of range? I have foo == length 3?
[13:14:27] <robertmaxrees> $("#test").contents().get(1) is one element.
[13:14:39] <arosen12> hrm okay, so it seems like 0 is at the start of foo and 1 is at the end of foo. What if i want in the middle of foo?
[13:14:48] <arosen12> to set the cursor
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> then you need to get the contents of foo itself.
[13:14:52] <arosen12> fo|o
[13:15:31] <arosen12> would you mind showing me what that looks like :/ I'm not quite sure I follow.
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> have you read the jquery tutorial at all?
[13:16:46] <arosen12> I've read some of it. I guess I'm not understanding this concept though.
[13:16:55] <robertmaxrees> so right now you're selecting the span itself.
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> you need to get the contents of the span.
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> much like you're getting the contents of #test.
[13:17:13] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jva5jk75/3/
[13:18:49] <arosen12> Ah okay I see thanks robertmaxrees. That makes sense.
[13:18:56] <robertmaxrees> get the idea now?
[13:19:13] <arosen12> yup :)
[13:52:35] <hellyeah> when ajax call is done readyStateChange will be changed?
[13:53:45] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[13:53:49] <robertmaxrees> not sure though.
[14:00:27] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/readyState
[14:01:02] <robertmaxrees> that's the readystate of that call.
[14:01:40] <taplar_> if your in a success, error, always, then(), done(), whatever, why do you need to know the ready state?
[14:01:57] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah also: are you using jquery here?
[14:02:00] <hellyeah> readystate is changed in each step 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> the document readystate orrr...?
[14:02:15] <hellyeah> i am not sure is there jquery equivalence of that?
[14:02:21] <hellyeah> i will check that
[14:02:54] <taplar_> what are you trying to use the ready state for?
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> he's building a web scraper.
[14:03:11] <robertmaxrees> one of the biggest thorns in my side these days.
[14:03:30] <taplar_> banks use web scrapers?
[14:03:37] <hellyeah> what does torns mean?
[14:03:38] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  i got another question about the cursor thing you helped me with. I was wondering if it's possible to set the cursor in a position in a contenteditable without having to deal with the child elements? For example If I wanted to put the cursor at position 4 here: https://jsfiddle.net/jva5jk75/4/
[14:03:43] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah thorns.
[14:03:50] <hellyeah> sorry for tyypo
[14:04:00] <hellyeah> taplar_:  i try to access ajax call of the page
[14:04:53] <taplar_> oh
[14:05:04] <arosen12> robertmaxrees:  otherwise it seems to do that I need to use: window.getSelection().focusNode and then do a bunch of stuff to calculate out which node I'm in and keep track of all the offsets.
[14:05:08] <taplar_> your trying to hook in to an ajax call that is not the page, from your own logic?
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 you can ask thge channel in general fwiw.
[14:05:11] <hellyeah> taplar_:  does it make sense?
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:05:22] <taplar_> not = on
[14:05:36] <arosen12> sorry i won't target you next time.
[14:05:38] <hellyeah> think about livescores webite
[14:05:51] <hellyeah> when a team make a score page will be updated with ajax call right
[14:06:07] <hellyeah> when it happened, i want to reach ajax call and get the dom
[14:06:24] <taplar_> the ajax call wouldn't return a 'dom'
[14:06:30] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 but i'm lost about your question.
[14:06:46] <hellyeah> taplar_:  yes
[14:07:00] <hellyeah> taplar_:  i am hoping to get this information with jquery
[14:07:18] <taplar_> if your wanting to hook into existing website logic from ajax calls there are global methods you can use like the beforeSend() stuff
[14:07:27] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range/setStart#Syntax
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> startNode is supposed to be a node.
[14:08:01] <robertmaxrees> i'd read up on the DOM API docs and how those work for more info.
[14:08:02] <taplar_> http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[14:08:23] <robertmaxrees> ^ this assumes the page is using jquery.
[14:08:29] <taplar_> sure
[14:08:29] <arosen12> I want to know the cursor position inside of something like this:  "<div id='test' contenteditable><b>hello</b> yes <b>22</b></div>
[14:08:40] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 set or get?
[14:08:50] <hellyeah> ajaxComplete is like readystatchange
[14:08:57] <arosen12> The only way i know how to figure that out is to use window.getSelection().focusNode and calculate it out.
[14:08:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 sure.
[14:09:04] <arosen12> I'm wonding if there is an easier way to do that.
[14:09:30] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 so you're just looking to get the current cursor position?
[14:09:35] <hellyeah> taplar_:  btw readystatechange seems like an event
[14:09:36] <arosen12> correct
[14:09:40] <arosen12> within a contenteditable.
[14:09:46] <arosen12> not within the node inside a contenteditable.
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> afaik that's how you do it.
[14:12:08] <taplar_> readystatechange is an event on a basic ajax request iirc
[14:12:24] <taplar_> never really did low level ajax calls myself
[14:13:24] <taplar_> not sure how you'd hook into low level ones though, without a debugger
[14:29:30] <ravenzz> hello
[14:29:49] <hellyeah> hey
[14:30:02] <antraxis> I'm looking for system for creating markdown documentations but with ability to include html partials to build entire layout, mixing html and markdown code as a result.
[14:30:21] <zumba_addict> afternoon folks, maybe you can shed some light
[14:30:29] <ravenzz> if I am reading a few attributes and selecting a couple of elements from a 20-30elements, does it make sense to clone each of them ?
[14:30:49] <ravenzz> basically do the reading operation and selection on the cloned object
[14:30:59] <robertmaxrees> ravenzz why are you cloning them?
[14:31:48] <robertmaxrees> confused about the benefits that would provide.
[14:31:57] <ravenzz> robertmaxrees: I assume that var baz = foo.clone(); baz.find('.bar'); baz.attr('something')
[14:32:10] <ravenzz> is done in memory ?
[14:32:16] <robertmaxrees> they're both done in memory.
[14:32:20] <ravenzz> k
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> there should be no speed difference either way.
[14:32:32] <ravenzz> gotcha
[14:32:46] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't prematurely optimize :)
[14:32:54] <zumba_addict> currently, we are using window.open to bring up our help link but it's being called via an event. So what I'm trying now(not sure if it will work) is I added a div with an id, then have that id's event click be called. However, it's not going inside the click function
[14:32:55] <ravenzz> how about inserting later... does it make sense to use requestAnimationFrame ?
[14:32:58] <zumba_addict> here is the code - http://pastebin.com/ycphFep9
[14:34:38] <robertmaxrees> ravenzz wut
[14:34:51] <ebbflowgo> hi! I'm looking to run the on('submit') when there is a required attribute on my input element, is this possible? http://codepen.io/anon/pen/PGwvdO?editors=1111
[14:35:41] <ravenzz> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/wilsonpage/fastdom
[14:35:51] <robertmaxrees> ravenzz are you having performance problems?
[14:36:04] <taplar_> ebbflowgo: what is your issue?
[14:36:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with the optimization trick.
[14:36:35] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict the element never gets added to the page.
[14:36:35] <ebbflowgo> taplar_: I would like the submit function to fire
[14:36:40] <ravenzz> tbh I haven't done any benchmark
[14:36:48] <zumba_addict> oh
[14:36:56] <robertmaxrees> ravenzz so i'd stop solving problems you're not having yet.
[14:37:02] <ebbflowgo> taplar_: if there is a required on the input then it blocks it from running
[14:37:05] <taplar_> ebbflowgo: if your required elements are not filled out, and your using a modern browser, the submit will not happen
[14:37:07] <taplar_> right
[14:37:17] <taplar_> why should it submit?  it's required and not filled out
[14:37:33] <ebbflowgo> taplar_: I'd like to handling the required myself
[14:37:39] <taplar_> so take the required tag off
[14:38:09] <zumba_addict> robertmaxrees, but the other issue i can't figure out is how do I add that div to the new window that hasn't even popped up yet. We are encountering pop-up issues right now. We can't tell different customers to edit their browsers settings to disable pop up blocker
[14:38:12] <ebbflowgo> taplar_: no way to keep the required on and prevent the default required action from happening?
[14:38:31] <ebbflowgo> ideally i keep required as it's more expressive to the reader
[14:38:32] <taplar_> the point of required="required" is to stop it
[14:38:35] <robertmaxrees> zumba_addict you realize that autoopening new windows looks REAL funky to popup blockers, right?
[14:39:08] <zumba_addict> i should have said, the basic disable popup blockers on browsers not like Adblock
[14:39:18] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:39:23] <zumba_addict> k
[14:39:27] <robertmaxrees> you're adding an element to the page, autoclicking it, and expecting to work with it.
[14:39:30] <ebbflowgo> taplar_: fair enough
[14:39:31] <robertmaxrees> see how that might look fishy?
[14:39:43] <zumba_addict> ok, what is the ideal solution
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> so what's the basic problem you're trying to solve?
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> like, getting away from popups.
[14:40:32] <zumba_addict> ok, right now, our window.open is inside a function that gets called via events
[14:40:57] <zumba_addict> however, like in safari, it didn't pop up until i found out that it was being blocked
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to automatically pop this up?
[14:41:17] <zumba_addict> in chrome to, i saw the popup blocked message on the location bar
[14:41:19] <robertmaxrees> because generally the browser wants to see user input handle that.
[14:41:20] <zumba_addict> no
[14:41:35] <zumba_addict> that's why i'm trying to mimic with $("#someid").click
[14:41:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not user-initiated.
[14:41:46] <robertmaxrees> brb
[14:41:49] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[14:43:15] <ravenzz> zumba_addict: $('#chatid').click(fn).trigger('click') ?
[14:43:27] <zumba_addict> oh cool, let me try
[14:43:29] <zumba_addict> thanks ravenzz
[14:44:56] <ravenzz> zumba_addict click(fn) is .on('click', fn) while click() alone is synonyms of .trigger('click')
[14:45:19] <zumba_addict> gotcha
[14:45:41] <zumba_addict> but now am worried with what robertmaxrees said earlier about adding an id to the dom, like the way I'm doing it
[14:46:26] <zumba_addict> is there other way of triggering clicks without specifying #id?
[14:46:47] <ravenzz> the id is not a problem
[14:47:02] <hellyeah> taplar_:  so $get will be executed when ajax call are being made right?
[14:47:12] <zumba_addict> adding to the dom which I don't want too
[14:47:24] <taplar_> hellyeah: depends on if the site is using jquery or not
[14:47:26] <ravenzz> the problem is that you are making a popup and opening automatically
[14:47:31] <ravenzz> browsers may block that
[14:47:38] <hellyeah> let say the site use jquery
[14:47:50] <zumba_addict> yup, and i'd like to prevent that so browsers won't block it
[14:48:14] <taplar_> then they have the option of using $.ajax, $.get, or $.post
[14:48:15] <ravenzz> oh well there is no way to do so
[14:48:37] <zumba_addict> what about the trigger and on which calls window.open?
[14:48:51] <arosen12> Is it possible to append an element after the focusNode doing something like this? window.getSelection().focusNode.after("<span> blah </span>") ?
[14:49:22] <taplar_> arosen12: more of a ##javascript question
[14:49:42] <ravenzz> zumba_addict: I think that browsers have a problem with popups in general, not with you firing a click event
[14:49:55] <zumba_addict> got it
[14:50:03] <ravenzz> i.e. throw a window.open() in your page
[14:50:12] <ravenzz> and see if the browser blocks it anyway
[14:50:19] <zumba_addict> i'll try, one sec
[14:50:30] <hellyeah> btw phantomjs questions are welcomed here
[14:50:35] <hellyeah> channel is silent
[14:52:04] <taplar_> are you saying it is dead?
[14:52:10] <taplar_> like a phantom
[14:52:25] <hellyeah> for now :D
[14:52:31] <hellyeah> i am waiting to see resurrection
[14:53:57] <antraxis> isn't it amazing that after jquery was said to be replaced by reactive libraries it still is living it's own life
[14:54:16] <taplar_> *shrug*
[14:54:19] <zumba_addict> ravenzz, sorry took me a while. I want to make sure my test was right. It still blocked it
[14:54:31] <hellyeah> could be back to life
[14:54:32] <ravenzz> there you go
[14:54:56] <zumba_addict> so no workaround?
[14:55:00] <hellyeah> i think method i need to understand is $get
[14:55:10] <taplar_> hellyeah: $.get?
[14:55:20] <hellyeah> $.get
[14:55:33] <taplar_> it's just a wrapper for $.ajax
[14:55:50] <hellyeah> what about $.post?
[14:55:56] <hellyeah> it is also wrapper?
[14:55:57] <taplar_> same
[14:56:02] <zumba_addict> i'm reading this now - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9514698/bypass-popup-blocker-on-window-open-when-jquery-event-preventdefault-is-set
[14:56:07] <taplar_> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.get
[14:56:27] <hellyeah> can i do ajax call and get some information from a website?
[14:56:48] <taplar_> if you're not blocked by cors, sure
[14:57:13] <hellyeah> i read about cross site restriction
[14:57:43] <hellyeah> is that what you meant?
[14:57:47] <taplar_> yep
[14:58:08] <hellyeah> it is suggested --web-security=false or something like that
[14:58:17] <hellyeah> is it possible to use that in jquery
[14:58:23] <hellyeah> i guess it is for phantomJS,
[14:58:27] <taplar_> js can't bypass cors
[14:58:37] <taplar_> would be meaningless if you could
[14:58:38] <hellyeah> phantomJS can do i guess
[14:58:49] <hellyeah> because it is client side?
[14:59:06] <taplar_> if your user can disable your security, how is it security?
[15:00:29] <robertmaxrees> back.
[15:00:43] <hellyeah> wb
[15:01:37] <hellyeah> google.com allows cors?
[15:01:45] <robertmaxrees> probably not.
[15:01:51] <taplar_> on their cdn, sure
[15:02:36] <hellyeah> how can i use "cdn"?
[15:02:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:02:51] <robertmaxrees> so what problem is hellyeah trying to solve here?
[15:02:58] <robertmaxrees> because i'm lazy.
[15:03:04] <taplar_> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/
[15:03:10] <taplar_> you can use all those hosted files
[15:03:10] <hellyeah> i will use $.ajax
[15:05:41] <robertmaxrees> of course we get a ton of wildfires right before summer is over.
[15:05:48] <robertmaxrees> well, ok, 2 major ones near me at least.
[15:05:53] <taplar_> :(
[15:06:28] <taplar_> i'm surprised a snake oil salesman hasn't popped up in california trying to sell motes
[15:07:32] <robertmaxrees> http://www.fire.ca.gov/current_incidents/incidentdetails/Index/1427 this one's pumping out tons of smoke today.
[15:07:58] <robertmaxrees> they're evacuating parts of a neighboring town because of it.
[15:08:34] <robertmaxrees> 840 acres last i heard.
[15:08:40] <taplar_> *brb* has there ever been any sort of study as to how many of these are started by fire bugs?
[15:09:36] <hellyeah> i am sorry it is simple question but what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/t3tacd1t/
[15:09:56] <robertmaxrees> the request didn't succeed.
[15:10:35] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/t3tacd1t/1/
[15:12:21] <taplar_> knock off the http: and you'll see the cors message
[15:12:51] <hellyeah> this is what you meant with cors? XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://www.google.com/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'https://fiddle.jshell.net' is therefore not allowed access
[15:12:56] <robertmaxrees> yes.,
[15:13:05] <hellyeah> i understand now
[15:16:29] <taplar_> i didn't see a response to it earlier, but are you doing this for work?  what does a bank use a scraper for?
[15:17:45] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah also: scrapers are kind of a grey area.
[15:18:16] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  what do you mean?
[15:18:29] <hellyeah> taplar_:  i am doing for myself with a friend
[15:18:36] <hellyeah> it is personel project
[15:18:37] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're using the scraper for can be a little iffy
[15:18:41] <taplar_> cool
[15:18:58] <hellyeah> i have some projects idea
[15:19:06] <hellyeah> let see what i can do
[15:21:14] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i am new on this topic can you be more clear?
[15:21:39] <robertmaxrees> sure: people like to come to our site, scrape our product data, then put this data up on their own site for various purposes.
[15:21:45] <taplar_> if your taking someone elses content and presenting it as your won, there is a rick there.
[15:21:49] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[15:21:50] <taplar_> *own
[15:21:54] <taplar_> risk
[15:21:55] <taplar_> crap
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> sometimes going so far as to link to use our images, as well.
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> that's a big no-no.  they also like to spin up multiple nodes that crawl through our pages and, if they're poorly written, cause our javascript error reporting and other metrics to go apeshit.
[15:23:36] <hellyeah> is it legal or illegal or gray?
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> depending on what you're doing with that data, illegal.
[15:24:05] <hellyeah> data mining
[15:24:34] <robertmaxrees> what are you using that data for?
[15:24:57] <robertmaxrees> also: lots of sites will automatically block you if you do enough :)
[15:25:01] <hellyeah> i dont know all details yer
[15:25:10] <hellyeah> but i will tell this concerns to my friend
[15:25:58] <hellyeah> btw
[15:26:03] <hellyeah> the error i got Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL about:blank from frame with URL file://example1.js. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[15:26:10] <robertmaxrees> more CORS
[15:26:23] <hellyeah> is it cors? hmm
[15:31:20] <taplar_> i used to have a scrapper, but it ran nightly and pretty sure i put a disclosure of the information origin on the page
[15:31:37] <taplar_> the dude was cool with it too
[15:31:44] <hellyeah> disclosure?
[15:31:58] <taplar_> "I got this stuff from XXXXX.  It is not mine"
[15:32:04] <hellyeah> like apology?
[15:32:14] <hellyeah> hmm i understand
[15:32:19] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:32:19] <ngharo> information wants to be free. scrape scrape scrape!
[15:32:22] <robertmaxrees> not an apology lol.
[15:33:47] <taplar_> you might can think of disclosures as resource sitings in like a research paper
[15:34:14] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  just clarifies that you don't own the data.
[15:35:37] <hellyeah> i dont wanna own data
[15:35:44] <hellyeah> why i want to have that
[15:35:53] <hellyeah> i just want to use for analyzing
[15:36:04] <robertmaxrees> what kind of analysis are you doing?
[15:36:32] <hellyeah> for example this site http://www.livescore.com/
[15:36:37] <hellyeah> there is some scores
[15:37:00] <hellyeah> i will get those scores and analyze the html.
[15:37:13] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/17769971
[15:37:19] <hellyeah> i dont know all details when i know i will explain more
[15:37:25] <taplar_> "Cookies are necessary to deliver our services. By using our services, you agree to our use of cookies."  lol, i love it
[15:37:42] <hellyeah> what is that? taplar_
[15:37:59] <taplar_> i have cookies restricted in most of my browsers.  sites don't like it, :)
[15:38:30] <taplar_> most don't phrase it like that though
[15:38:44] <taplar_> usually it's like, "we use cookies to improve your experience. blah blah blah"
[15:39:09] <arc_> sounds like an annoying way to use the internet D:
[15:39:18] <taplar_> which way?
[15:39:27] <arc_> restricted cookies
[15:39:50] <taplar_> not really.  not everyone complains, and the majority of the time it doesn't impact usability
[15:40:03] <decx> use self destructing cookies instead
[15:40:23] <arc_> as long as you allow the ones that save your session on stuff that you use all the time
[15:40:47] <taplar_> never save stuff. always kill cookes on browser close
[15:40:54] <taplar_> i don't need to stay logged into gmail
[15:41:06] <robertmaxrees> hah.  you're our nightmare user.
[15:41:10] <taplar_> :)
[15:41:23] <arc_> i really really really do not want to have to log in every time i use anything
[15:45:49] <hellyeah> this is "seperation of concern" i guess
[15:45:58] <hellyeah> it can be defined with that phrase?
[15:47:14] <robertLunch> can what be?
[15:49:10] <hellyeah> arc_ prefer something and taplar_ prefer another thing :D
[15:49:51] <robertLunch> that's not separations of concern.
[15:49:59] <robertLunch> that's just different preferences.
[15:50:27] <hellyeah> :D
[15:50:30] <hellyeah> okey
[16:07:00] <Onionnion> Is there a built-in way to guarantee that only one section of an accordion is open at a time?
[16:07:11] <robertLunch> depends on which accordion you're using.
[16:07:43] <Onionnion> oh wait I'm derping
[16:07:48] <Onionnion> that's the default behavior lol
[16:07:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:08:04] <arosen12> is it possible to use after() but append a text node?
[16:09:01] <robertmaxrees> after doesn't append.
[16:09:28] <Onionnion> I'm playing with this right now, trying to get a behavior such that, when it's clicked, they'll each go below the whole row of items
[16:09:30] <Onionnion> http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/ORPYPW
[16:09:41] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/q3pmqLts/
[16:09:49] <Onionnion> might just need some fixed styling
[16:10:11] <robertmaxrees> Onionnion then you don't want an accordion.
[16:10:16] <robertmaxrees> those are tabs.
[16:10:51] <flobin> hi everyone, I'm trying to use tinymce and this thing called pjax from here (https://github.com/MoOx/pjax) and it appears that the tinymce editor doesn't get reloaded when the content loads via pjax... do any of you know why that might happen? the relevant code bit is here: https://gist.github.com/Flobin/e61d54692a1d21c152eaeeb062d937d8
[16:11:05] <Onionnion> ohh neat
[16:11:08] <Onionnion> thanks, I'll try that
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> flobin document.addEventListener("pjax:success", DOMContentLoaded('pjax')); isn't doing what you think it is.
[16:11:54] <robertmaxrees> flobin i'm going to guess that console log only happens once, right?
[16:12:14] <flobin> robertmaxrees it actually happens twice, but why isn't it doing what I think it's doing?
[16:12:41] <flobin> if it helps: https://www.dropbox.com/s/g8k0jnxieuo1bum/Screenshot%202016-09-06%2022.12.33.png?dl=0
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> are you getting one that says "document" and one that says "pjax"?
[16:12:50] <robertmaxrees> and then never any others?
[16:13:18] <flobin> yes, that's correct
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> lol once for document and once for pjax.
[16:13:37] <robertmaxrees> document.addEventListener("pjax:success", DOMContentLoaded('pjax'));  - that's not how you register callbacks.
[16:13:58] <robertmaxrees> DOMContentLoaded('pjax') runs that function on bind and then assigns the return to be the callback.
[16:14:04] <robertmaxrees> you want to pass the function object.
[16:14:11] <robertmaxrees> document.addEventListener("pjax:success", DOMContentLoaded);
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> traditionally, you wouldn't pass arguments on these - you'd abstract this out so that each handler has its own function to call.
[16:14:35] <flobin> ah, that's what I had before, I added the ('pjax') bit to try and debug things
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[16:16:45] <arosen12> robertmaxrees: hrm if i do that it doesn't actually create a text node. I think it needs to be $("div").after("&nbsp"); is there a way to tell it to use that as a text node?
[16:16:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:16:58] <robertmaxrees> if it's in text, it's a text node.
[16:17:03] <robertmaxrees> all text is contained in a textnode.
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> arosen12 could you clarify why you're confused?
[16:23:34] <flobin> robertmaxrees so I replaced my code with this: https://gist.github.com/Flobin/e61d54692a1d21c152eaeeb062d937d8
[16:23:44] <flobin> and on first page load the tinymce editor gets applied
[16:23:50] <flobin> but when clicking around a bit, it doesn't
[16:24:01] <robertmaxrees> any console errors
[16:24:26] <flobin> https://www.dropbox.com/s/ozmtkivn05sk0g7/Screenshot%202016-09-06%2022.22.26.png?dl=0 this is the console, no errors
[16:24:46] <flobin> do you have any idea how I can debug that tinymce.init() function?
[16:25:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing that  console.log(tinymceConf); ever gets called.
[16:25:50] <robertmaxrees> so if ($e.length != 0) { is likely failing.
[16:26:16] <flobin> console.log(tinymceConf); outputs though
[16:26:29] <flobin> so $e.length != 0 is not failing
[16:26:40] <robertmaxrees> ah i see now..
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry screenshots of cose are funky.
[16:27:05] <flobin> yeah I know, not sure what the best way of showing the console is
[16:27:22] <robertmaxrees> generally we ask for a fiddle.
[16:27:28] <robertmaxrees> though that'd be funky in this case.
[16:27:56] <Onionnion> Is this the correct way to say "close all tabs when the mouse has left the element"? http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/ORPYPW
[16:28:00] <robertmaxrees> also: var tinymceConf = $.parseJSON($e.attr('data-mce-conf')) - should be var tinymceConf = $.parseJSON($e.data('mce-conf'));  just as an fyi.
[16:28:11] <flobin> oh, thanks
[16:28:12] <Onionnion> not the navtabs.on()
[16:28:14] <Onionnion> note*
[16:28:53] <Onionnion> It works but I'm unsure if it's the 'right' way
[16:28:56] <flobin> robertmaxrees that gets me VM749:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1 though
[16:29:19] <robertmaxrees> flobin heh, ditch the parseJSON
[16:29:43] <flobin> so just $e.data('mce-conf');?
[16:29:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:29:57] <flobin> yep that works
[16:32:37] <flobin> robertmaxrees but in any case, do you know of any techniques that might help with debugging?
[16:32:52] <robertmaxrees> flobin fixingthesejquery.com is the best i can offer.
[16:33:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to verify that your config is in the correct format.
[16:33:19] <flobin> well, it should be, because it works on first page load
[16:33:24] <flobin> just not when you click around the website
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean on those subsequent pjax calls.
[16:34:19] <robertmaxrees> since i don't have the page in front of me it's really hard to know what the issue might be.
[16:34:49] <flobin> yeah
[16:37:27] <flobin> in any case thanks so much
[16:39:54] <dviola> hi
[16:40:24] <dviola> can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong here please: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/2c5d1d3ecc56e7f5801efb41d50a216c
[16:40:35] <dviola> I'm trying to upload some gpx data to the openstreetmap server
[16:43:04] <robertmaxrees> are you getting an error or something?
[16:43:09] <dviola> no
[16:43:47] <dviola> and the api is also not very well documented, so this is why I'm stuck
[16:44:18] <robertmaxrees> link to the api docs?
[16:44:37] <dviola> https://github.com/osmlab/osm-auth
[16:44:59] <dviola> http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6#Uploading_traces
[16:45:41] <dviola> .xhr(options, callback)
[16:45:45] <robertmaxrees> slow down
[16:45:47] <dviola> so I don't know how I'm supposed to pass the data in there
[16:45:51] <dviola> ok
[16:45:52] <robertmaxrees> url: "/api/objects/track/" + track_id + ".gpx"
[16:45:56] <robertmaxrees> you realize that's a relative url, right./
[16:46:12] <dviola> yes
[16:46:33] <robertmaxrees> so is that actually hitting the correct url?
[16:46:45] <dviola> yes, that's not my problem
[16:46:54] <dviola> my problem is how to send the data
[16:47:04] <dviola> auth.xhr({ method: 'POST', path: '/api/0.6/gpx/create' }, data);
[16:48:07] <dviola> :/
[16:48:18] <robertmaxrees> so you have two different libraries you're using together.
[16:48:51] <dviola> yes
[16:50:32] <robertmaxrees> http://osmlab.github.io/osm-auth/
[16:50:35] <robertmaxrees> check the page source.
[16:51:21] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Rob! ^.^
[16:51:23] <Darmani> What's up man?
[16:51:31] <robertmaxrees> Darmani life.  yourself?
[16:51:45] <hellyeah> darmani life
[16:51:50] <Darmani> I'm good brehh. I haven't been here for a while. I missed ya xP
[16:52:03] <hellyeah> i supposed it means smt
[16:52:05] <hellyeah> darmani life
[16:52:12] <hellyeah> it should be something so catchy
[16:52:17] * hellyeah Darmani life
[16:52:19] <dviola> robertmaxrees: should I add a done function and make another ajax request in there?
[16:52:24] <Darmani> wat o.o
[16:52:26] <robertmaxrees> dviola that's what it looks like.
[16:52:30] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah huh?
[16:52:32] <dviola> robertmaxrees: thanks
[16:52:35] * hellyeah laughing
[16:52:51] <hellyeah> nevermind
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> uh, kay.
[16:53:17] <hellyeah> Darmani life it sounds as happy life
[16:53:30] <taplar_> it's a delicious cerial
[16:53:34] <Darmani> hellyeah: ...o.O?
[16:53:37] * taplar_ gives up
[16:53:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:53:50] <hellyeah> man scraping is illegal
[16:53:56] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah it can be.
[16:53:56] <hellyeah> site wont allow it
[16:53:59] <flobin> robertmaxrees I fixed it, for what it's worth
[16:54:04] <robertmaxrees> flobin what was it?
[16:54:05] <flobin> all it took was a tinymce.remove();
[16:54:08] <robertmaxrees> flobin hah!
[16:54:13] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  if site does not allow it you wont do that
[16:54:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's storing a global reference.
[16:54:19] <flobin> basically if it's loaded by ajax tinymce thinks it's still there, I guess
[16:54:23] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah they can only stop CORS.
[16:54:26] <flobin> yeah
[16:54:28] <hellyeah> you will use api to get data for it in case site supply that
[16:54:50] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you realize you shouldn't be using in-browser tools for this, right?
[16:54:52] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  you mean header right
[16:55:09] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you really want to use a server-side setup.
[16:55:15] <robertmaxrees> a scraper is trivial in python.,
[16:55:36] <hellyeah> phantomjs also work in server-side?
[16:55:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:55:47] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh bro. I've been fixing up my resume and applying for jobs recently, would you mind taking a look at it?
[16:55:55] <hellyeah> so i could do that with phantomjs right
[16:56:00] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah sure.
[16:56:10] <hellyeah> i mean it is like writing jquery in nodej
[16:56:11] <hellyeah> s
[16:56:17] <flobin> what robertmaxrees is right, scraping is really easy in python
[16:56:25] <flobin> you've got scrapy, selenium
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah... huh?
[16:56:34] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I guess not? o.o
[16:56:46] <hellyeah> you could write js/jquery in phantomjs
[16:56:51] <robertmaxrees> Darmani chill, yo.
[16:56:56] <hellyeah> and phantomjs is executed in nodejs
[16:56:56] <robertmaxrees> i have a dayjob ;)
[16:56:59] <hellyeah> am i wrong?
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> and if i have time, sure?
[16:57:07] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I didn't mean right now D:
[16:57:12] <Darmani> I meant when you have time -.-
[16:57:17] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah sure, but you don't use jquery in phantom to pull data.
[16:57:24] <robertmaxrees> but really, use python.
[16:57:30] <hellyeah> okey
[16:57:49] <hellyeah> something else what would that be?
[16:57:53] <robertmaxrees> jquery.
[16:57:56] <robertmaxrees> err, python.
[16:57:57] <robertmaxrees> haha
[16:58:00] <hellyeah> :D
[16:58:25] <robertmaxrees> i wrote a basic scraper once that nabbed metadata from pages in like 70 someodd lines or something.
[16:58:43] <robertmaxrees> granted it's slow as hell and isn't async, but it worked for my purposes.
[16:58:48] <hellyeah> do you have the script?
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> i can't share it sadly.
[16:59:00] <hellyeah> sure no problem
[16:59:05] <taplar_> awesome group
[16:59:15] <hellyeah> thank you
[16:59:29] <hellyeah> need to sleep now
[16:59:33] <hellyeah> good night
[17:04:04] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[17:05:31] <taplar_> i feel like i was misunderstood
[17:05:41] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[17:05:44] <taplar_> lol
[17:55:10] <spamor> is there a maximum size for the page that can be parsed when doing $("#item").load() to replace part of a page with part of a GET request?
[17:56:04] <spamor> the page I'm loading is about 20k in size and by adding an alert into a sample $.post() it only outputs the first half of the page.
[17:56:36] <taplar_> i wouldn't think so, unless your request is timing out or something
[17:57:48] <spamor> definitely not timing out.
[17:58:06] <taplar_> by 20k you mean 20kb?
[17:58:09] <spamor> it always truncates in the same place.. halfway through an html5 video tag.
[17:58:22] <spamor> 20,000 bytes (approx)
[17:58:38] <taplar_> yeah, that's not too big
[17:59:03] <taplar_> heh, i mean some pages can be mb large
[17:59:13] <spamor> it's for a wordpress shortcode plugin you see, they tend to post forms back to the same page and when it reloads, the shortcode outputs 'thanks for submitting' instead of the form itself.
[17:59:29] <spamor> i'm trying to make it output the 'thanks' message without actually reloading the page.
[18:02:15] <Darmani> So, the links on my page don't go anywhere. Does anyone know why that would be?
[18:02:15] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ecf6cb845407b3c2a63e9bacc7eeafef#file-index-html-erb-L18
[18:09:00] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual HTML?
[18:09:20] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: The rendered html? It should be included in the Gist o.o
[18:10:23] <spamor> it's there I think..
[18:10:25] <spamor> 	<a href="/users/1?sort=created_at+asc">Latest</a>
[18:10:54] <Darmani> spamor: The link?
[18:11:01] <spamor> Yeah.. https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ecf6cb845407b3c2a63e9bacc7eeafef#file-source-html-L60
[18:11:18] <spamor> that's the rendered html isn't it?
[18:11:28] <Darmani> spamor: yeah.
[18:13:03] <spamor> looks ok to me, although I don't see where jQuery is used.
[18:13:49] <robertmaxrees> 5bux says you have an event handler stopping you.
[18:13:56] <Darmani> spamor: It isn't being used. I just thought someone might be able to point out an obvious mistake or something.
[18:14:29] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Lol that's pure css but I am using an event handler of sorts.
[18:14:56] <robertmaxrees> you have javascript files included (shrug)
[18:15:00] <robertmaxrees> i can't see them sooo
[18:15:30] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I can include them hold on.
[18:15:54] <spamor> my "page truncated" issue - I've put the js file at https://gist.github.com/simonamor/54c37b928c4f1b0fde1a1d955870ada4 - unfortunately there's no public test page I can link to.
[18:16:09] <robertmaxrees> spamor woah.
[18:16:15] <robertmaxrees> spamor try using console.log() instead.
[18:16:17] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/ecf6cb845407b3c2a63e9bacc7eeafef
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> or some other way to verify.
[18:16:49] <spamor> I tried console.log instead of alert and it dumped out the whole page.
[18:16:50] <robertmaxrees> Darmani no idea then.  maybe make a fiddle.
[18:17:02] <spamor> but it doesn't find the form still.
[18:17:02] <robertmaxrees> spamor so console log worked, right?
[18:17:28] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: Well that's the thing, I made a fiddle and did the exact same thing but the links worked on fiddle =/
[18:17:38] <robertmaxrees> Darmani dunno then (shrug)
[18:17:45] <Darmani> D:
[18:18:33] <robertmaxrees> spamor you already have an element with that id on the page.
[18:18:35] <spamor> robertmaxrees - yes, console.log worked, but even using attempt 2 and not storing anything in a temporary variable or alerting etc, it didn't work.
[18:18:38] <jose3_> Is this a valid filter? I ma trying to filter something with two criteria. one that it matches a number and withing that number it matches a string: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5c0037f3fe81b2ab31bd5ba79c62810b
[18:19:35] <spamor> robertmaxrees will it not replace the <form id=..> with the <span id=...>? Does it insert inside the <form> tag instead and thus create duplicate ids?
[18:20:19] <spamor> oh, found an issue..
[18:20:26] <spamor> it's trying to GET not POST.
[18:20:39] <robertmaxrees> also: "This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID of result, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded."
[18:20:47] <robertmaxrees> not a replacement.
[18:21:07] <spamor> ah, ok.
[18:28:12] <Onionnion> Any ideas on how I can make the tab animation smoother? http://codepen.io/ryanbreaker/pen/ORPYPW
[18:29:29] <spamor> robertmaxrees - it seems to remove the form tag actually.
[18:29:39] <spamor> I got it to work :)
[19:26:05] <ZoderUck> formdata.serialize i have duplicate key value pairs because i have  input text fields with the same name, how do i remove the duplicates ?\
[19:27:36] <taplar> change the form to not have duplicate names?
[19:48:38] <ZoderUck> taplar, uh that is not possible
[19:48:53] <ZoderUck> how do i loop trough each item and delete items ?
[19:49:38] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck you use .filter()
[19:49:54] <taplar> why is it not possible to change the form?
[19:50:11] <taplar> just curious
[19:50:56] <robertmaxrees> also: you say to dedupe, but how do you know which key/value to take?
