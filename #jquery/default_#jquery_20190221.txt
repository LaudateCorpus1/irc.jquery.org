[03:00:48] <hellangel7> hello guys i have this problem ... https://pastebin.com/pCXbaqjB
[03:01:04] <hellangel7> please tell me how to substitute in ajax data variables
[03:03:52] <hellangel7> https://pastebin.com/6D11z5kj
[03:03:56] <hellangel7> full code
[03:04:03] <hellangel7> if i was not specific
[03:37:58] <hellangel7> i fixed thank you seems a variable was not even on the get list
[03:48:32] <Cork> hellangel7: to answer the question: { first_name: first_name },
[04:11:50] <hellangel7> is there a way to see all the variables and what they are assigned
[04:12:01] <hellangel7> i used alert to get to this problem
[04:12:05] <hellangel7> and its tedious
[04:12:09] <Cork> hellangel7: variables in what?
[04:12:18] <Cork> in the browser?
[04:12:18] <hellangel7> javascript\
[04:12:21] <Cork> no
[04:12:23] <Cork> not generically
[04:12:59] <hellangel7> what you mean ..
[04:13:04] <hellangel7> generically
[04:13:19] <Cork> you can check properties in an object, or global variables (properties in window)
[04:13:28] <Cork> but you can't list all defined variables
[04:13:41] <hellangel7> yes i see
[04:14:12] <hellangel7> tq @Cork
[04:23:20] <hellangel7> guys! i was asked to test the performace of javascript ...given ajax push all the data to server then ( it does verification ) then presents back the data...other senario is i push data individually for text boxes to check to see if it was okay
[04:24:16] <Cork> hellangel7: javascript won't care about the difference between those
[04:24:32] <Cork> depending on how many fields there is
[04:24:38] <Cork> the network most likely will though
[04:24:53] <Cork> cause browsers limit the number of connections per domain
[04:25:00] <Cork> so you quite likely will hit that
[04:26:14] <Cork> hellangel7: simplest way to get all the values from the form is just to do $('the-form').serialize() or $('the-form').serializeArray()
[04:26:33] <Cork> then you can send those through ajax or loop them and make a separate call per row
[04:26:48] <Cork> the former can't be looped though (as it is a string)
[04:37:57] <hellangel7> okay
[05:24:07] <hellangel7> join #CodeIgniter
[05:24:24] <hellangel7> #codeIgniter
[05:24:35] <hellangel7> sorry guys :d
[18:01:32] <Plorka> Im trying to use filter() but i get the Object.keys returned while i want to return the object in it what im doing wrong . https://jsfiddle.net/d3by9f6x/
[18:01:40] <robertmaxrees> Plorka you're filtering the array returned by Object.keys
[18:01:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:01:51] <Plorka> lol xd
[18:02:15] <robertmaxrees> you can't use 'filter' on an object.
[18:02:42] <robertmaxrees> so your entire setup is... weird.
[18:03:27] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: what is the correct way to return the object in it
[18:03:31] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: because in this case i need the Object.keys to run a loop if im not wrong
[18:03:32] <Plorka> lol
[18:03:38] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do?
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to run filter on an object?
[18:03:51] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: i want to get the extrainfo object of every holder
[18:04:06] <robertmaxrees> okay?  are you trying to get them in an array?
[18:04:40] <robertmaxrees> like, what's the resulting data-structure you're looking for?
[18:08:26] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: i made a mistake in my example https://jsfiddle.net/d3by9f6x/1/ so i want to get back the arrays in every main Object
[18:09:06] <robertmaxrees> Plorka in an array or...?
[18:09:17] <gr0undh0g> why no worky?: https://pastebin.com/SBP03kZ1
[18:09:41] <robertmaxrees> gr0undh0g is .Node-renderedContent a parent element of that div?
[18:09:46] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: in a array because i want to loop also in that array to check some values
[18:10:02] <robertmaxrees> Plorka then you want map and then filter
[18:10:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lum71v2b/1/
[18:10:51] <robertmaxrees> filter just... filters.  it doesn't return objects or w/e
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> gr0undh0g also: node-line and needsclick are both on the same element - so you need to remove the space between them.,
[18:16:10] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:16:21] <gr0undh0g> Yes
[18:16:44] <robertmaxrees> also: if that element is dynamically created, you'll need to use a delegated handler instead.
[18:16:58] <gr0undh0g> um .. delegated handler?
[18:17:07] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:17:15] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:17:20] <gr0undh0g> it probably is dynamic
[18:17:30] <robertmaxrees> then you probably need the delegated handler.
[18:17:33] <gr0undh0g> thanks
[18:17:44] <robertmaxrees> protip: it's not just using .on() - make sure to read through the docs on them first.
[18:17:51] <robertmaxrees> and don't just skip to the first example ;)
[18:18:15] <gr0undh0g> okie dokie
[18:19:52] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: let filter = map.filter(function(a){ 	console.log(a) }) give me empty
[18:20:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:20:05] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[18:20:27] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle i mean.
[18:21:22] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/r62f9m5L/
[18:21:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:21:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:21:50] <robertmaxrees> why are you logging out of filter??
[18:22:02] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4wtageod/
[18:22:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting results here.
[18:22:35] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: sorry wrong one i mean like this https://jsfiddle.net/r62f9m5L/1/
[18:22:53] <robertmaxrees> right so
[18:23:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sxcy6p7b/
[18:23:38] <robertmaxrees> notice how that .forEach just loads out undefined?
[18:23:54] <robertmaxrees> *logs out
[18:24:33] <robertmaxrees> Plorka
[18:25:46] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: yes
[18:26:11] <robertmaxrees> Plorka it's because you have an array of arrays.
[18:26:19] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want to flatten your array first.
[18:26:29] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: yes i need to get the test[index]
[18:26:34] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:26:38] <robertmaxrees> there's no index off test.
[18:26:48] <robertmaxrees> do you control the format of the data you're readinmg?
[18:27:16] <robertmaxrees> brb
[18:27:35] <Plorka> robertparkerx: why i do get the array if I use it this way https://jsfiddle.net/Lpef2jqd/
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> back but in meetings.
[18:55:18] <taplar> Plorka: what's the question?
[18:55:27] <Plorka> Im trying to use filter() but i get the Object.keys returned while i want to return the object in it what im doing wrong . https://jsfiddle.net/d3by9f6x/
[18:55:32] <robertmaxrees> lol 2 steps forward 1 step back.
[18:56:03] <Plorka> I also tried to map it but i dont get the right objects
[18:56:20] <robertmaxrees> object.keys returns an array of property names.
[18:56:30] <robertmaxrees> your filter is then trying to filter those names down.
[18:56:35] <robertmaxrees> neither of those
[18:56:53] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: also couldnt do it with the map option
[18:56:57] <robertmaxrees> *neither of those are doing what you want (shrug) i showed you how to get the array and then mentioned you need to flatten it.
[18:57:16] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you're throwing all that out ;)
[18:57:27] <taplar> Object.values() will get you the array of values to filter
[18:58:15] <robertmaxrees> they want a a single array that's a concatenation of all the extrainfo arrays (shrug)
[18:58:21] <taplar> ah
[18:58:39] <taplar> which would be a reduce()
[18:58:50] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: also in this example https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4wtageod/ i get in my filter returned in indexes
[18:58:54] <robertmaxrees> a reduce, or a map with a flatten.
[18:59:01] <robertmaxrees> you don't want filter, though.
[18:59:09] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you keep coming back to filter.
[18:59:34] <Plorka> i mean forEach*
[18:59:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:00:06] <robertmaxrees> you just need to flatten the array at that point.
[19:00:29] <Plorka> robertmaxrees: i try but i get it back indexed look in your own example https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4wtageod/ you use forEach
[19:00:47] <robertmaxrees> i was using that to demonstrate a point.
[19:00:50] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[19:00:55] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[19:01:13] <Plorka> Anyone else who can help me ?
[19:03:33] <taplar> Plorka: you can use a reduce to put all the elements into a single array. https://jsfiddle.net/463qbLet/
[19:04:09] <taplar> there may be an add all or push all option i'm not aware of right now, but that's an example solution
[19:04:25] <Plorka> taplar: and how do i do results.info1 === "info1"
[19:04:39] <taplar> what do you mean?
[19:04:54] <taplar> both objects have an info1 key
[19:05:16] <Plorka> taplar:  yes but for example if i want the info1 object to be returned
[19:05:30] <taplar> there's no such thing as "a" info1 object in your json
[19:06:00] <Plorka> taplar: 0: {info1: "info1", info2: "info2"} 1: {info1: "info1", info2: "info2"
[19:06:15] <taplar> yep, if you want the first one, then results[0].info1 === "info1"
[19:06:22] <taplar> or results[1].info1 === "info1"
[19:06:27] <taplar> normal array notation applies
[19:06:56] <Plorka> taplar: yes i want this to be automated thats why i want to use a loop, because i have a lot of record
[19:07:21] <taplar> so in the real world example will the values of info1 be unique between all of them?
[19:07:54] <Plorka> taplar: info1 will be true or false
[19:08:13] <Plorka> taplar: so i need to be able to check info1 wheter is true or false
[19:08:14] <taplar> are there more than two objects?  Can multiple of them have info1 of true?
[19:08:22] <robertmaxrees> can you share an actaul example of the data and show us the end result you want?
[19:11:43] <Plorka> robertparkerx: and taplar this is the "real" object https://jsfiddle.net/vdnwhzg2/ i need to be able to check inboxsound is 1 OR 0
[19:12:05] <CoderGuy> okay so i'm using someone elses code & i'm running into an error I think it has to do with visual display
[19:12:23] <robertparkerx> Plorka, what?
[19:12:27] <CoderGuy> so the error i'm running into is when I call .offset() it's umm undefined
[19:12:41] <CoderGuy> would something be undefined if it wasn't visible?
[19:12:46] <taplar> Plorka: so are you wanting to get the objects that contain an inboxsound of 1?
[19:13:07] <Plorka> taplar: yeps
[19:13:10] <CoderGuy> actually hold on I can just change that in the html lol
[19:13:14] <taplar> all of them, correct?
[19:13:41] <Plorka> taplar: it could also be if there is one === true return true so i can play the sound()
[19:15:11] <taplar> so if you take note of my last fiddle with the reduce, that pattern can be used to get an array of all the objects with the inboxsound in them.  at that point, you just need a filter on those that have an inboxsound === 1
[19:15:26] <taplar> or the reduce could be changed to not push those that do not match that criteria
[19:16:03] <taplar> depending upon the attack pattern you want to go after.  buy any who, gotta run.  l8r peeps
[19:16:40] <Plorka> Lol thats just the problem i dont get it worked after that LOL!
[20:41:14] <gr0undh0g> guess I need a pastebin account.  wife is home, gotta cook, bbl  https://pastebin.com/t7jRCNyd
[22:26:40] <Starship8015> hi, i am trying to add a background to :before only if the element does not have a child
[22:26:59] <Starship8015> .col-md-6:before:not(:empty) { background: #000; } // does not work, any ideas?
[22:27:36] <Starship8015> the intention is to have the col-md-6 show a "placeholder" background color
[22:31:45] <Starship8015> https://jsfiddle.net/fdqswr3h/ if someone has an idea^
[22:33:01] <Starship8015> oh got it ^
[22:33:05] <Starship8015> .col-md-6:empty:after { } works
