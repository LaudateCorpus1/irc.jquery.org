[00:04:47] <Cork> slax0r: no it isn't
[00:10:20] <slax0r> Cork: how come?
[00:10:37] <Cork> slax0r: the first one is delegated, the second isn't
[00:12:27] <slax0r> Cork: I think I've chosen the wrong words, again. Don't they both provide the same effect? Attach to a scroll event of a selector?
[00:12:50] <Cork> slax0r: your merking it a bit
[00:12:58] <Cork> yes they do, but not in the same way
[00:13:23] <Cork> slax0r: and btw, the first one doesn't work (just realized that)
[00:13:26] <slax0r> I understand that they don't function both in the same way
[00:13:30] <Cork> scroll doesn't bubble so you can't delegate it
[00:13:38] <slax0r> yes, that's the real deal, it doesn't work
[00:13:48] <Cork> slax0r: ya cause the first one is delegated
[00:13:50] <slax0r> oh, so it's normall that you can't attach the scroll event with on?
[00:13:57] <Cork> you can
[00:14:09] <Cork> slax0r: it isn't about .on vs .scroll
[00:14:22] <Cork> it is about bind and delegate
[00:14:34] <Cork> delegate only works for events that bubble
[00:14:39] <slax0r> so, .bind would work?
[00:14:48] <Cork> yes and so will .on
[00:14:53] <Cork> if you don't use the delegate syntax
[00:15:07] <slax0r> so, selector.on(scroll)?
[00:15:13] <Cork> (document).on("scroll", "selector", function() {}) vs ("selector").on("scroll", function() {})
[00:15:32] <slax0r> ah! now I understand :)
[00:15:52] <slax0r> I need a jquery for dummies book and a few of work days :)
[00:16:01] <slax0r> thank you, once again!
[00:31:57] <Jonno_FTW> hi
[00:32:06] <Jonno_FTW> how can I select on multiple attributes?
[00:33:09] <Cork> $('div[data-v1][data-v2="t"][data-v3="other]')
[00:33:27] <Cork> if you mean they should all be present
[00:40:34] <Jonno_FTW> Cork: thanks
[00:41:02] <intent> I'm trying to make a login form that appears as a splash-screen (the same kind of fade in effect as lightbox has, I dont know what to call it) when a div is clicked, but also with a noscript option to redirect to a login page. Can somebody point me to either where to begin or a code example please?
[00:44:19] <axscode> hi in jquery is there like===>   statement ? value : value2;
[00:48:15] <Rodael> axscode: yes, but it actually exists in javascript.
[00:48:35] <axscode> same syntax?
[00:48:56] <Rodael> axscode: condition ? expr1 : expr2;
[00:49:10] <axscode> perfect thanks Rod
[00:49:27] <Rodael> You're welcome :)
[01:01:20] <sflw> If I use a return statement inside an if loop does that exit the function as well as the loop or just the loop?
[01:01:40] <Cork> sflw: depends on how you loop
[01:01:55] <sflw> Cork: Hang on I'll update this fiddle for you so you can so.
[01:01:56] <sflw> see*
[01:01:58] <Cork> but if you by "if loop" mean something like for() { if() { return; } }
[01:02:07] <Cork> then yes it will exit the function the loop is in
[01:02:32] <sflw> it's function() { if ( if ( return; ) ) }
[01:02:47] <Cork> that isn't a loop
[01:02:52] <sflw> it's a statement.
[01:02:54] <sflw> I mispoke.
[01:03:12] <Cork> and yes return inside the block of an if statement exists the function the if statement is in
[01:03:28] <sflw> Good to know.
[01:03:59] <sflw> Follow-up question: I'm working with a global variable here. Do I need to return it so the value of the variable is updated globally or does it happen automatically?
[01:04:18] <Cork> uh
[01:04:36] <sflw> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/gXb4d/2/
[01:04:37] <Cork> sflw: these are extremely basic questions
[01:04:43] <sflw> Cork: I'm an extremely basic newb.
[01:05:05] <Cork> if you modify the value of a global variable, you modify the value of the global variable
[01:05:11] <Cork> that is what makes it global :)
[01:05:23] <sflw> Imagine that. :P
[01:06:18] <sflw> All right one more question and then I'll disappear back into my newb cave.
[01:06:56] <sflw> If you look at the code above, I'm trying to increment the count variable and then use the value of count to modify the innerHTML of a span with id #count. It's not working like I have it currently.
[01:07:14] <sflw> Am I barking up the wrong tree here or have I just implemented it incorrectly?
[01:07:41] <Cork> var counter = $("#count").text("" + count + ""); <-- this won't work
[01:07:54] <Cork> your executing that code before the page is loaded
[01:08:01] <sflw> Oh.
[01:08:04] * sflw facepalm.
[01:08:10] <Cork> actually
[01:08:15] <Cork> none of those global variables will work
[01:09:00] <sflw> Right.
[01:13:40] <Cork> sflw: http://jsfiddle.net/gXb4d/5/
[01:13:47] <Cork> not sure why you have the count == 0 though
[01:13:54] <anli__> Should not firebug automatically update its html view (the one showing nodes) when I for instance check a checkbox?
[01:13:57] <Cork> so you would have to check that yourself
[01:14:13] <Cork> anli__: it should
[01:14:23] <anli__> So it is broken for me
[01:14:28] <Cork> anli__: though the old 1.x firebug is a bit buggy about that
[01:14:36] <Cork> it sometimes misses those
[01:14:47] <anli__> I use 29.0.1 :)
[01:14:52] <anli__> oh
[01:14:56] <anli__> haha, firebug you said
[01:14:58] <sflw> Oh.
[01:15:15] <sflw> Cork: I was going to explain why I needed that but in formulating my answer I realized I didn't need it.
[01:15:22] <Cork> (firebug 1.x uses the old deprecated debugger in firefox)
[01:15:23] <Cork> anli__: you just said you used firebug...
[01:15:25] <anli__> 1.12.8
[01:15:43] <anli__> I said firebug, but I gave you my firefox version
[01:15:50] <anli__> 1.12.8 is what I use
[01:15:56] <Cork> anli__: so you use the 1.x ya
[01:15:56] <Cork> and ya the debugger it depends on is buggy
[01:16:08] <anli__> So I just have to update it then?
[01:16:18] <anli__> I dont even see an update option under add-ons
[01:16:19] <Cork> anli: 2.x is in alpha :)
[01:16:28] <anli__> But it works?
[01:16:45] <Cork> i think it for some other reason then the debugger depends on ff30+
[01:17:01] <Cork> https://getfirebug.com/downloads
[01:17:07] <Cork> Compatible with: Firefox 30+ <--
[01:17:20] <Cork> oh
[01:17:24] <anli__> So I need to get a firefox as well then
[01:17:24] <Cork> 2.0 is in beta now
[01:17:31] <Cork> ff beta ya
[01:17:49] <Cork> anli: or you could just use the built in debugger for the few weeks until ff30
[01:18:24] <anli__> What about chrome, should it update its "Elements" view when I check a checkbox?
[01:18:48] <Cork> anli: i just realized something
[01:18:53] <Cork> by "element view"
[01:18:54] <anli__> Cool
[01:19:07] <Cork> are you talking about "checked" on the checkbox?
[01:19:11] <anli__> Yes
[01:19:14] <Cork> AH
[01:19:27] <anli__> The only attribute that can have a checkbox appear checked :)
[01:19:30] <Cork> anli: then no, no inspector is meant to show that in the view
[01:19:43] <Cork> as what they show is attributes
[01:19:46] <Cork> not properties
[01:20:13] <Cork> so they don't show the state of form elements
[01:20:15] <anli__> I have seen checked without a value there
[01:20:31] <Cork> if it was entered in the html ya
[01:20:56] <anli__> If just use checked in the html, firebug shows it like checked=""
[01:20:56] <ir7466> Hello, I have this as the value of a dropdown option:
[01:20:58] <ir7466> {&quot;locations&quot;:&quot;Loc1,Loc2,Loc3,Loc1,Loc2,Test Item&quot;,&quot;frequency&quot;:20,&quot;type&quot;:1}
[01:21:10] <Cork> anli: sure
[01:21:13] <ir7466> When a button is clicked, how can I convert that into proper json in jquery?
[01:21:13] <anli__> So firebug does not really distinguish attributes from properties then
[01:21:49] <Cork> ir7466: it should be normal json when you get it from the dom
[01:21:57] <anli__> If I have a text input instead, should not firebug reflect changes of value?
[01:22:06] <Cork> anli__: uh, no the complete oposite
[01:22:07] <ir7466> Cork: but it's got the escaped quot's?
[01:22:16] <Cork> anli__: no
[01:22:25] <sflw> Cork: Thanks for the assistance btw, very helpful.
[01:22:29] <Cork> ir7466: it shouldn't
[01:22:40] <ir7466> it automatically changes it?
[01:22:40] <Cork> ir7466: can you make a small jsfiddle of this problem?
[01:22:45] <anli__> So all remembrance of firebug being able to do that is false?
[01:22:47] <Cork> the html parser does yes
[01:23:00] <Cork> anli: this isn't about firebug
[01:23:07] <ir7466> Cork: I'll need a few minutes. I haven't got any jquery for it yet, just the html side
[01:23:18] <anli__> To me it is about firebug :)
[01:23:25] <Cork> anli: no inspector in ANY browser or extension shows the state of form elements
[01:24:03] <anli__> And has never done that?
[01:24:14] <Cork> anli: nope
[01:24:15] <Cork> never
[01:24:18] <anli__> Crazy
[01:24:25] <Cork> anli: no it isn't
[01:24:37] <anli__> The crazy thing is that I think they have done it
[01:24:49] <Cork> it would mean the inspector would have to update on every keypress and that would be very expensive
[01:25:05] <anli__> How would it be expensive?
[01:26:20] <Cork> anli__: they would have to listen for every event that comes from any form elements
[01:26:32] <anli__> Yes?
[01:26:35] <Cork> and modify the elements value on every user keypress mouse click and so on
[01:26:43] <Cork> that is by definition expensive
[01:26:53] <ir7466> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Wa3R2/
[01:26:55] <codecowboy> Can anyone offer any insight on this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23741994/how-can-i-filter-remote-results-without-multiple-ajax-requests-with-select2
[01:27:17] <anli__> Nothing is per definition expensive, but ok
[01:27:25] <anli__> Lets not talk about that then
[01:28:09] <Cork> ir7466: http://jsfiddle.net/Wa3R2/1/
[01:28:32] <Cork> ir7466: if you check your console you have json
[01:29:02] <Cork> ir7466: if you want that as a js object you need to parse it though
[01:29:06] <anli__> If I inspect an element in the DOM panel, I can right click and update to get an updated view of the attributes, maybe thats all I need to solve my problem
[01:29:11] <Cork> but if all you want is json you have it already
[01:29:17] <ir7466> Cork: oh ok, awesome
[01:29:17] <anli__> Although I am limited to only showing one element
[01:29:26] <ir7466> how do I do that?
[01:29:32] <Cork> anli: you have an updated view of the attribute
[01:29:38] <Cork> anli: that is what the view shows
[01:29:50] <Cork> anli: property != attribute
[01:29:59] <Cork> ir7466: do what?
[01:30:01] <Cork> parse?
[01:30:27] <ir7466> Yeah, I vaguely recall being able to do something like: test.frequency
[01:30:34] <ir7466> if you had var test = $('#test').val();
[01:30:42] <Cork> ir7466: http://jsfiddle.net/Wa3R2/2/
[01:30:44] <ir7466> or does a json function need to be applied to test?
[01:30:51] <Cork> you prob want to store the parsed object in a variable though
[01:31:01] <ir7466> ah
[01:31:03] <ir7466> yes
[01:31:06] <ir7466> thanks
[01:33:14] <ir7466> thank you Cork
[01:33:19] <ir7466> exactly what I needed
[01:33:20] <Cork> np
[01:53:49] <ir7466> Cork?
[01:53:58] <ir7466> ifyou're still around, I tried it and got: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data
[01:54:20] <Cork> ir7466: make sure your json is valid then
[01:54:31] <Cork> ir7466: start by console.log(json)
[01:54:36] <ir7466> sorry, ignore me
[01:54:38] <Cork> and if that looks ok
[01:54:39] <ir7466> I just realised
[01:54:43] <ir7466> typo in the id :\
[01:55:16] <ir7466> all good now :)
[01:55:18] <ir7466> cheers
[02:00:05] <aro> i have 4 divs, and in each of those divs are 4 more divs, so its essentially a 4x4 block of 16 divs. When one is hovered, it expands down a bit. Is there a plugin that will scoot the ones below it down, without affecting the other ones in the row below?
[02:02:06] <rindolf> Hi all.
[02:02:10] <aro> haoi
[02:02:20] <skullcrasher> hi
[02:02:38] <aro> i wonder if masonry would do it
[02:03:14] <rindolf> aro: skullcrasher : hello, what's new?
[02:03:33] <aro> not a lot. trying to find something to deal with these pesky columns
[02:03:56] <rindolf> aro: table columns?
[02:04:02] <aro> not tables
[02:04:06] <rindolf> aro: ah.
[02:04:13] <aro> suppose i have a 4 divs (rows)
[02:04:17] <aro> in each i have 4 divs
[02:04:22] <aro> so a 4x4 square of elements
[02:04:40] <rindolf> aro: ah.
[02:04:57] <aro> if a user hovers a div, it resizes the height by about 40 px down, i want it to shuffle the elements below it down, without affecting the others in the corresponding rows
[02:29:29] <Mazi> Hi jQuery experts, a short question: There is a submit button at my HTML form which submits the page if a users enters text at a text input field and then hits enter. If I now hide the button using JS, will clicking enter still submit the form?
[02:30:04] <Cork> Mazi: depends on how you hide it
[02:30:19] <Cork> Mazi: ie demands that the button is NOT display: none;
[02:30:37] <Mazi> display: none would be the easy way.
[02:30:39] <Cork> you can make it transparent though
[02:30:51] <Cork> Mazi: and that one isn't supported in ie
[02:30:54] <Mazi> Cork, how should I hide it so that it will NOT submit the form anymore?
[02:31:03] <Cork> ah
[02:31:33] <JustMozzy> hey guys. I have a weird behaviour for the jqeury ui tooltip on on apple touch devices. the tooltips never close. anyone has an idea?
[02:31:34] <beancurd> Mazi: disabled
[02:31:37] <Cork> Mazi: $('button').prop('disabled', true).hide()
[02:31:45] <Mazi> thanks everyone, have a great day!
[02:32:20] <beancurd> JustMozzy: aren't tooltips on touch devices generally a bad idea?
[02:32:36] <JustMozzy> beancurd: I'd say yes but unfortunately not my call
[02:48:29] <JustMozzy> this is really weird. I have another tooltip on the page and it closes properly. no difference in the initialization or markup
[03:01:21] <krz> given the following string: https://www.foo.com?foo=foo&bar=bar, how can i change bar's value to baz?
[03:04:52] <kraftman> regex?
[03:05:12] <Cork> ya
[03:05:45] <Cork> replace(/bar=[^=&]/, 'bar=baz')
[03:20:47] <brunoais> Cork, would it be: replace(/bar=[^=&$]+/, 'bar=baz')
[03:21:12] <Cork> brunoais: uh no
[03:21:20] <Cork> when would you have $ in the params?
[03:21:21] <brunoais> otherwise it would only change the value such that it would end with "az"
[03:21:45] <brunoais> Hum... I have to confirm that, but I beleive that the "$" inside "[]" still means the end of the string
[03:21:46] <Cork> well ya i missed the +
[03:21:51] <Cork> but the $ isn't correct
[03:22:00] <Cork> brunoais: nope
[03:22:08] <brunoais> it is literal?
[03:22:12] <Cork> ya
[03:22:14] <brunoais> ok
[03:22:35] <Cork> the only none literal character inside [] is ], ^ and -
[03:23:07] <brunoais> the "^" is only if it is the 1st character inside, right?
[03:23:18] <brunoais> otherwise it is literal
[03:26:16] <brunoais> Cork, ^
[03:26:48] <Cork> brunoais: not completely sure, but i think yes
[03:27:04] <brunoais> regexbuddy says yes...
[03:27:06] <Cork> can't i use it much in range selectors
[03:27:26] <brunoais> for the "-" it is special if not the last in the list
[03:27:32] <brunoais> :)
[03:27:42] <brunoais> but yeah, you were right about "$"
[03:27:43] <Cork> ...
[03:27:54] <Cork> if you noticed i wasn't that specific with the comments
[03:28:02] <brunoais> yes I did
[03:28:10] <brunoais> that's why I was a bit confused :)
[03:28:30] <Cork> brunoais: and again please try to not be so time consuming all the time...
[03:28:39] <brunoais> sorry :(
[03:28:48] <brunoais> I'm quite eager to learn that I forget that
[03:28:49] <Cork> or your going to force me to stop helping in this channel
[03:28:59] <Cork> i can't spend 30 mins on every subject
[03:30:34] <slax0r> don't do that :/
[03:30:38] <slax0r> who am I going to bug in the morning? :)
[03:30:46] <brunoais> slax0r, me
[03:47:41] <krambiorix> hi, when i drop a draggable element with a helper, i want to hide the original element... How can i do that?
[04:02:24] <Tomashe> any JS coder want some freelance work? please contact me
[04:04:22] <Cork> Tomashe: please take that to a propriety channel
[04:05:50] <Tomashe> Ok
[04:10:56] <oemp> hi guys, If I'm corect it's not possible to close a general webpage using window.close() and window.close() only works when the window is opened by javascript. Does this mean that I can add a "close" button on the -opened- window?
[04:11:59] <Cork> oemp: yes, if the window/tab is opened by window.open you can close it with window.close() inside it
[04:12:09] <Cork> or ref.close() from the parent
[04:13:36] <oemp> cork thanks. does window.open() open a new "popup" window, or does it normally opens in a new tab? (I guess this is browser specific)
[04:14:01] <Cork> oemp: that depends on heuristics in the browser
[04:14:08] <oemp> ok, thanks
[04:14:20] <Cork> but if i remember correctly if you set a width and height of the window.open you get a popup
[04:14:33] <Cork> if you don't you get what is configured in the browser
[04:45:00] <bberry> is there a way to get a copy (instead of a reference) to an array of objects?
[04:45:09] <bberry> the objects are only 1 level deep
[04:45:44] <slax0r> var arr = arr1.slice(0);
[04:45:56] <slax0r> slice will clone arr1 and return a ref to it
[04:46:11] <bberry> oh nice
[04:46:14] <slax0r> err, ref to the clone
[04:46:18] <bberry> lol yeah
[04:46:23] <bberry> didnt know slice gavea  copy
[04:46:44] <bberry> lol for some things i've been doing JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
[04:52:40] <brunoais> bberry, maybe the one you are confusing with is splice()
[04:55:15] <Cork> brunoais: no slice is correct
[04:55:23] <brunoais> I know
[04:55:48] <brunoais> I was refering to: "didnt know slice gavea  copy"
[05:06:15] <jammanbo> I don't find the docs clear … do username and password in $.ajax options correspond to basic auth username and password?
[05:07:20] <Cork> jammanbo: yes
[05:07:30] <jammanbo> Hmm
[05:08:21] <jammanbo> Cork: When I specify username/password no Authorization header gets sent. When I manually add the Authorization header, it does. Any ideas? This is cross domain.
[05:08:27] <Cork> jammanbo: it mappes to the username and password here https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#open%28%29
[05:09:09] <Cork> jammanbo: if i remember correctly the xhr username and password doesn't encode the fields or something like that
[05:09:21] <Cork> jammanbo: so you usually want to do it manually
[05:09:46] <jammanbo> you mean manually add the header, as opposed to manually encode the two felds?
[05:10:26] <Cork> yes
[05:10:57] <jammanbo> That's a shame. It's not a big deal, but it seems a little unnecessarily ugly.
[05:11:09] <Guest95033> my firend told me that in new release of jquery many old api will be depreciated?
[05:11:15] <Cork> jammanbo: well basic auth doesn't really work in browsers so...
[05:11:42] <Cork> Guest47838: uh if you by "new" mean jquery 1.9 then ya quite a few was removed back then
[05:11:46] <jammanbo> alright, thanks Cork
[05:11:57] <Guest95033> new means version after 2.x
[05:12:11] <Guest95033> any idea?
[05:12:16] <Cork> 2.x is a one to one map to 1.x
[05:12:21] <zylophone> this looks interesting - http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/examples/path.html
[05:12:27] <Cork> only difference is that they dropped old ie support
[05:13:14] <Guest95033> yeah that is in 2.x and 1.x
[05:13:39] <Cork> Guest95033: and to this point i haven't heard of any plans for a 3.x
[05:14:20] <OnkelTem> Hi
[05:14:25] <OnkelTem> Any Isotope users here?
[05:14:42] <Guest95033> http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/jquery-2-0-javascript-framework-to-drop-support-for-ie-6-7-and-8/
[05:14:58] <Cork> ya, that was 2.x
[05:15:09] <Cork> and all it dropped was compatibility code for old ie
[05:15:24] <Cork> apart from that it is the same as 1.x
[05:15:35] <Cork> (like i said like the second comment to your question)
[05:15:55] <OnkelTem> I broke my head trying to figure out how to add gaps between columns for fitRows layout: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/layout-modes.html. Any ideas?
[05:16:12] <zylophone> so, i'm trying to work with holder.js, but don't seem to be able to resize dynamically, am i doing something wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/bDT3v/
[05:18:42] <zylophone> ahh got it! http://jsfiddle.net/bDT3v/1/
[05:19:33] <brunoais> WTF? framework?
[05:19:37] <brunoais> jQuery is not a framework
[05:21:40] <zylophone> get over it
[05:21:51] <zylophone> ...newb ;)
[05:22:25] <marl> hey i'm trying to edit the visibily of a child div it seems that id^=topImgDiv won't work properly, some has any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/BhGR3/
[05:25:59] <decx> this doesnt make sense
[05:26:14] <decx> you're wildcarding the id which is bad already
[05:26:22] <decx> to get the saem class which is ridiculous
[05:26:39] <decx> also, visible isn't in quotes and as such thinks it's the variable visible
[05:27:09] <marl> i have to admit, that i really don't know how to do it, i have 20+id to handle
[05:27:52] <decx> i don't get what you're doing, there are no hidden elements to be made visible
[05:28:10] <marl> all topImgDivSec_* divs are hidden
[05:28:11] <decx> oh those divs
[05:28:26] <marl> i want to make them visible on mouse over
[05:28:38] <marl> 1 by 1 depending or where the mouse is
[05:28:45] <marl> -or+on
[05:30:08] <decx> that's just css http://jsfiddle.net/decx/BhGR3/1/
[05:33:02] <marl> Wow
[05:33:06] <marl> i'm feeling so stupid right now.
[05:33:29] <decx> and be careful with the attribute selectors in css and jquery
[05:33:43] <marl> I was about to build a nuclear central to make this thing work, it was just css.
[05:33:45] <marl> why ?
[05:33:49] <decx> instead of *[id^='topImgDivSec_'] { just have one class
[05:33:59] <decx> because it's slow
[05:34:03] <decx> and too specific
[05:34:33] <decx> you're selecting ALL items in the dom with *, and then you check all items if they contain the attributevalue
[05:34:43] <marl> which is terrible
[05:34:48] <zylophone> ouch
[05:35:01] * Cork nods
[05:35:11] <Cork> +
[05:35:13] <Cork> opps
[05:35:16] <zylophone> depends - does he work for ms?
[05:35:20] <marl> HAHA
[05:35:21] <zylophone> boom boom!
[05:35:27] <decx> #rekt
[05:35:41] <Cork> zylophone: what does ms have to do with this??
[05:35:52] <marl> havent slepts since 2days, i was looking for shortcuts and i made my life even more complicated
[05:35:56] <marl> thanks a lot decx :)
[05:36:12] <decx> also your images have the same id
[05:36:15] <decx> that's illegal
[05:36:27] <decx> the id police will be at your door at once
[05:36:30] <marl> hahahaha
[05:36:37] <Cork> heh
[05:36:46] <marl> ye i will fix this, i was lazy
[05:36:56] <Cork> ya, the world is often way to fixated with ids
[05:37:05] <Cork> they should much more often use classes instead
[05:37:27] <decx> that's what that sheriff in arizona said
[05:37:38] <Cork> heh
[05:38:02] <decx> "if he's brown, id doesn't matter he's guilty"
[05:38:13] <decx> .brown*
[05:38:15] <Cork> ...
[05:38:24] <zylophone> that's what it was like in teh 90s
[05:38:30] <bberry> slax0r you around?
[05:38:38] <zylophone> oh he's black... he's guilty... of something
[05:38:41] <bberry> turns out slice doesnt give a copy, gives a reference... http://jsfiddle.net/rLLTb/
[05:39:19] <Cork> bberry: it does give you a copy
[05:39:28] <zylophone> is it valid to store a function in an object? like {foo:function(){bleh...}}
[05:39:28] <Cork> bberry: a copy of the reference to the object
[05:39:39] <bberry> lol
[05:39:49] <Cork> bberry: i'm serious
[05:39:52] <rindolf> zylophone: yes, it is.
[05:39:57] <bberry> i know. but i need an actual copy
[05:40:16] <Cork> bberry: then you need to copy the objects
[05:40:17] <rindolf> zylophone: a function reference is a first-order object.
[05:40:18] <zylophone> rindolf: so is there a reasonable way of doing that?
[05:40:18] <bberry> one that does not give me a pointer to the same array, but creates a new array at a separate memory location with the same contents
[05:40:28] <rindolf> zylophone: doing what?
[05:40:31] <Cork> bberry: you need to do a recursive clone of the array
[05:40:36] <decx> that's object literal zylophone
[05:40:41] <bberry> Cork: and i assume theres not a function to do that?
[05:40:54] <Cork> bberry: var copy = $.extend(true, [], arr);
[05:41:02] <Cork> there is :)
[05:41:13] <zylophone> mhh, i'm putting together a list of data, and i want to specify an optional function to be fired on a specific event
[05:41:30] <bberry> ah yeah thatd work
[05:41:32] <zylophone> the data being a list of objects
[05:41:45] <bberry> ive been doing JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr)), which works too
[05:42:10] <Cork> bberry: that only works as long as you only have pure json data in the object
[05:42:12] <bberry> but i worry tha ti lose data that way
[05:42:15] <bberry> yeah
[05:42:21] <bberry> like prototype data
[05:42:37] <Cork> bberry: well i would worry more about the code crashing on the stringify
[05:42:48] <bberry> gotcha
[05:43:29] <zylophone> rindolf: i just want some way of defining a custom function for each object
[05:43:37] <bberry> Cork: whats the difference of doing var newArr = arr, and var newArr = arr.slice(0)
[05:43:45] <bberry> because, they appear to be the same thing.
[05:43:54] <rindolf> zylophone: then put it inside an object attribute
[05:43:56] <bberry> s/,//
[05:44:10] <Cork> bberry: var a = [1,2,3], b = a; b[1] = 5; a === [1,5,3]
[05:44:19] <Cork> bberry: var a = [1,2,3], b = a.slice(); b[1] = 5; a === [1,2,3]
[05:44:37] <zylophone> rindolf: object attribute?
[05:44:53] <rindolf> zylophone: a slot/field/member-var/key/whatever.
[05:44:54] <Cork> bberry: slice() clones the array
[05:45:00] <zylophone> ahh ok
[05:45:10] <rindolf> zylophone: I don't know how it's called in JavaScript.
[05:45:12] <Cork> bberry: but it doesn't clone objects/arrays in the array
[05:45:25] <Cork> aka. it doesn't deep clone
[05:45:27] <rindolf> But there's a proliferation of such terms for what is essentially the same thing.
[05:45:48] <bberry> Cork: ah, those are the words i wanted to hear
[05:48:22] <zylophone> mhh, a local jsfiddle clone would be really handy right now
[05:49:57] <decx> there's live preview plugins for most editors
[05:51:15] <zylophone> yeah something to just install locally to have a screw around rather than have to manually program the same structure each time
[05:58:33] <zylophone> wow - not one jsfiddle clone can i find! guess i'm going to have to get busy
[05:59:48] <decx> check out my jsfiddle clone
[05:59:54] <decx> it's a flatfile structure
[05:59:57] <decx> <!doctype html><html><head></head><body></body></html>
[06:02:26] <zylophone> decx: wow, that's awesome!
[06:02:43] <zylophone> now, add a ui, external libraries and you're away
[06:03:27] <decx> it's modular and widget ready, offline first, ima post it to hackernews
[06:03:46] <zylophone> go decx!!!1
[06:03:50] <decx> actually i'm going to catch some vitamin d in the park it's like 25°c
[06:03:54] <decx> later
[06:03:59] <zylophone> you'll catch cancer
[06:04:18] <zylophone> you're in uk?
[06:04:18] <decx> when don't i
[06:04:24] <decx> germany
[06:04:37] <zylophone> ahh, must feel a lot hotter in .de. no strong winds?
[06:05:15] <drej> decx whats the url to the jsfiddle clone?
[06:05:34] <drej> i missed that part
[06:06:31] <zylophone> /usr/bin/vim
[06:12:33] <OnkelTem> Is there a jquery plugin for replacing FORM's SELECT with nice drop-down menu?
[06:31:06] <paulvd> hello, i am trying to sort a list with links numerically, but the output is stripping off the links http://jsfiddle.net/Vuw5F/
[06:40:05] <Cork> paulvd: http://jsfiddle.net/Vuw5F/1/
[06:43:06] <paulvd> thanks Cork !
[07:04:33] <sflw> Hi everyone. I'm writing a "hot or cold" guessing game and I'm trying to implement a "warmer" or "cooler" feedback for the user based on the user's last guess and it's proximity to the secret number (closer/further) but I can't seem to conceive of a good way to do it. Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/gXb4d/6/
[07:04:46] <sflw> If someone here can help nudge me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.
[07:05:13] <sflw> My original scheme was adding 100 to the guess number and then subtracting the secret number and seeing if the result was bigger/smaller than the previous guess.
[07:05:23] <sflw> I'm not sure if that will work or if that's the best way to go about it.
[07:06:16] <Cork> sflw: why add 100?
[07:07:19] <Cork> just do Math.abs(guess-secret)
[07:07:36] <Cork> and if the resulting value is larger then the old result value
[07:07:40] <Cork> its colder
[07:07:45] <Cork> and if it is smaller its hotter
[07:08:35] <dwarder> does this only works if ajax async is true?
[07:08:35] <dwarder>   $(document).ajaxStart(function() {
[07:08:35] <dwarder>         $("#spinner").show();
[07:08:36] <dwarder>     });
[07:08:56] <dwarder> when ajax async == false it doesn't fire up
[07:08:58] <dwarder> right?
[07:09:20] <Cork> dwarder: it can't fire
[07:09:26] <Cork> as nothing is executing in sync
[07:09:51] <dwarder> Cork: so, right?
[07:10:03] <dwarder> Cork: just to make sure
[07:10:23] <Cork> dwarder: yes, the event doesn't fire as the page doesn't execute at all
[07:10:54] <dwarder> got it
[07:10:56] <dwarder> thank you
[07:10:57] <Cork> dwarder: to be extra clear, not even gif animations happens while sync ajax happen
[07:18:11] <sflw> Did I miss anything?
[07:26:21] <sflw> Honestly what's a man gotta do to get some decent net around here?
[07:26:33] <sflw> Cork: I kept DCing and missed anything you might have said.
[07:26:52] <Cork> sflw: http://irc.jquery.com
[07:28:24] <Cork> sflw: check that link, it loggs the channel
[07:28:25] <Hale> Test.
[07:29:19] <sflw2> Cork: I'll have a look, thanks.
[07:29:57] <sflw2> Ah, saw you comment about Math.abs.
[07:30:01] <sflw2> I'll give that a try!
[07:57:32] <leachim6> so I guess john doesn't hang out in here anymore now that he's webfamous lol
[07:59:57] <BillCriswell> leachim6: Yeah, it's been a long time since I seen him in here.
[08:00:23] <leachim6> He used to be in here all the time, nice guy.
[08:00:52] <BillCriswell> Yeah, from what I can recall for certain.
[08:03:13] <drej> now you guys are just stuck with me instead
[08:03:22] <drej> cue the collapse of freenode
[08:03:44] <BillCriswell> I was ready for a giant net split.
[08:05:48] <endikos> Hey folks.  Got a bit of wierdness I’d like to ask about. I’m trying to grab the text inside a span, and no matter if I use the .html or .text methods on the span’s selector, I’m getting chunks of javascript.  It appears that jQuery is returning its own function for .html and .text instead of executing it.  screenshot of the relevant code and execution here:  http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=71589
[08:06:01] <endikos> Any ideas what I’ve screwed up?
[08:06:26] <BillCriswell> drej: It pains me to think that he was where I am now with programming like.... 25 years ago. He's 30.
[08:06:54] <BillCriswell> endikos: .html() or .text()
[08:07:00] <BillCriswell> not .html or .text
[08:07:04] <endikos> geez
[08:07:10] <endikos> Thanks.
[08:07:14] <drej> BillCriswell i was one of those early bloomers as well
[08:07:14] * endikos is a giant doofus
[08:07:20] <drej> although i didnt get the same level of notoriety of course
[08:07:38] <drej> it just pains me that im still here doing this shit 20 years later
[08:07:39] <drej> lol
[08:07:39] <BillCriswell> drej: I didn't have a computer till I was like 16.
[08:07:52] <drej> i quit highschool and owned my own company with 5 employees by the time i was 16
[08:07:54] <BillCriswell> I remember actually being afraid I was going to make my first computer explode.
[08:08:04] <BillCriswell> drej: That's awesome.
[08:08:15] <BillCriswell> endikos: It happens haha.
[08:08:32] <drej> it had its ups and downs of course, 16 is way too young to run anything, i was naive
[08:08:40] <drej> but live and learn :)
[08:09:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I'm sure you learned a lot from that.
[08:09:06] <endikos> BillCriswell: Yeah.  This is an indicator that I have too much blood in my caffeine stream.  Thanks again!
[08:09:18] <drej> yeah, mainly learned "SAVE YOUR FUCKING MONEY"
[08:09:19] <drej> lol
[08:09:34] <drej> we made a TON of money early in the game, but then the dotcom crash happened, and we were left starving 2 years later
[08:09:36] <BillCriswell> drej: Yeah.. still learning that one. I love to spend as does my girlfriend haha.
[08:09:38] <drej> in 2000
[08:09:40] <BillCriswell> endikos: No problem!
[08:10:01] <drej> i remember working on the first ever car configurator on the internet for Honda in 1997
[08:10:05] <drej> those guys were paying us like 30k/week
[08:10:18] <BillCriswell> Damn.
[08:10:20] <drej> to build this stupidly complex flat database of shit
[08:10:32] <drej> good times
[08:10:33] <BillCriswell> Haha. It was a lot harder back then I imagine.
[08:10:38] <BillCriswell> Well, no I imagine.
[08:10:43] <BillCriswell> It was a lot fucking harder.
[08:10:56] <drej> yeah, it was a lot harder, and a lot more ... tedious than anything
[08:11:04] <drej> i remember having to create something like 35,000 different image assets
[08:11:14] <drej> with different permutations of colours/equipment/etc
[08:11:39] <drej> (not create them manually, but spend several weeks just slicing up shapes, then running relatively complex photoshop macros)
[08:11:54] <BillCriswell> drej: Brutal.
[08:12:12] <drej> we earned our keep lol
[08:13:36] <BillCriswell> I remember my first photoshop macro.
[08:13:40] <BillCriswell> That was a beautiful day.
[08:14:18] <BillCriswell> black and white to color mouseovers. Those were the days.
[08:14:19] <drej> haha yeah
[08:14:33] <drej> slicing up menu item images with text in them
[08:14:34] <BillCriswell> The website was 800px wide. That's it.
[08:14:35] <drej> so you can get hover states on them
[08:15:00] <drej> yeah i think i aimed for 640 resolution at that point
[08:15:00] <BillCriswell> Haha ugh I hated when a client wanted images for text.
[08:15:53] <BillCriswell> I always seemed to be missing the fonts I originally used when I created the menu and the new ones never quite looked the same.
[08:16:16] <drej> haha yeah, i remember when whatthefont came out and i was soo grateful
[08:16:27] <drej> would feed it perfectly isolated cut up images with text in them and get the font
[08:16:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that still comes in handy for me.
[08:16:56] <BillCriswell> Great tool.
[08:17:13] <drej> absolutely
[08:17:55] <drej> yesterday i spent an entire day with no technology, at home
[08:18:10] <drej> my laptop wasnt available, and i have no TV right now, and my GF left for a month, so i was all alone, and had nothing to do
[08:18:14] <drej> then i ... read .... a book
[08:18:15] <drej> that was weird
[08:18:19] <drej> papers and ink and such
[08:18:40] <BillCriswell> The last time I did that I got a terrible headache. People complain about getting headaches from looking at screens and I think for me it's the complete opposite.
[08:19:08] <BillCriswell> drej: I'd have to go outside and go to a park or something and read haha. I couldn't imagine just sitting on my couch and reading.
[08:19:13] <drej> i felt great this morning, rested and refreshed, i generally like not doing technology things, but usually im not stuck at home
[08:19:19] <drej> yeah, that was the only challenge
[08:19:30] <drej> i mean i love going camping for a few days and not touching technology, or doing nature things
[08:19:39] <drej> but being stuck at home, on that same couch i normally watch TV on, and not being able to have access to technology
[08:19:44] <sflw2> Sheesh, there's nothing I love more than curling up on a comfy couch with a book I can't put down.
[08:19:45] <drej> i mean... i had my phone and tablets and such
[08:19:58] <sflw2> Be it ebook or otherwise.
[08:20:04] <drej> sflw2 im definitely revisiting it, missed reading too much
[08:20:24] <drej> im on my 4th novel this year so far, which is a huge improvement over the last few years
[08:20:30] <sflw2> Since I've become an "adult" (I use the term loosely) I've definitely seen how easy it is to stop reading.
[08:20:50] <BillCriswell> I read on the trolly and el and that's about it.
[08:20:52] <drej> ive been an "adult" for a while, but its so hard to find a chunk of time to be able to do that in
[08:21:06] <sflw2> Fortunately I have a well-stocked Amazon wish list so if I'm ever not sure what to read I just go there and buy something.
[08:21:08] <BillCriswell> I'm not comfortable enough to have my computer out usually on those.
[08:21:36] <drej> i normally just listen to music when im taking public transportation
[08:21:39] <drej> and observe people
[08:21:41] <drej> i love watching people
[08:21:51] <drej> but i havent taken public transportation in ages
[08:21:53] <drej> i normally bike everywhere
[08:21:59] <drej> except some dick stole my bike a few weeks ago
[08:22:01] <sflw2> Music or podcasts for me, though generally the former.
[08:22:01] * drej shakes a fist
[08:22:04] <sflw2> Oof.
[08:22:05] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I have my headphones in usually as well ( when I'm reading I just listen to instrumental stuff ).
[08:23:50] <BillCriswell> sflw2: If I'm not REALLY interested in what someone is talking about I'm zoned out in like 10 seconds. My attention span is terrible.
[08:24:57] <sflw2> I know what you mean. My problem is usually I start trying to apply what the person is saying to my life immediately and then I lose 5-10 minutes to thinking about that and not listening.
[08:26:53] <BillCriswell> sflw2: It's tough haha
[08:32:54] <jayesh92> Hi, could any 1 suggest is it a good a idea to make a JS based applctn using jQuery moblie and then port it to android, using phonegap
[08:33:14] <jayesh92> I want to make a native android app
[08:59:28] <Manaus> hi, I load some dom <a class="link"> elements with ajax, but a $('.link').on("click", function() { console.log('xx')} does not render result
[08:59:40] <raskel> hello, i have a app which shares notes. i have to find out an way to be able to refresh/update the notes list of one user when the other add/delete a note. one way is to make a ajax call on every second to my back-end server, but i find it too rich. any other ideas?
[09:00:42] <JustMozzy> hola muchachos
[09:00:52] <BillCriswell> Manaus: Do $(document).on('click', '.link', function () { console.log(this); });
[09:00:53] <Cork> Manaus: you most likely run the event handler before you add the elements
[09:01:17] <JustMozzy> got a weird chrome and opera behaviour on fadeIn. sometimes it fades in and sometimes it doesn't do anything. what to do?
[09:01:25] <BillCriswell> Manaus: Ideally document should be a closer, static parent to .link.
[09:01:31] <BillCriswell> But document will work just as well.
[09:01:38] <Manaus> thanks Cork and BillCriswell
[09:02:36] <Cork> raskel: only other option is to have the collision managed on submit
[09:02:41] <Manaus> how do I trigger the even handler function when the dom is available?
[09:03:02] <Manaus> declare the fn on success etc?
[09:03:06] <Cork> raskel: ex. by sending in the old time stamp and refusing to update unless it is the same
[09:03:19] <raskel> Cork, thanks. any tutorial about it?
[09:03:35] <Cork> Manaus: do what BillCriswell gave you, it creates a delegated event listener
[09:03:36] <raskel> i cant figure out only by words how should i do implement it.
[09:03:41] <Cork> Manaus: and that will solve it
[09:04:07] <Cork> raskel: when you send the old notes out, send the current "updated" column from the database
[09:04:18] <Cork> raskel: when you send it back, just send in the same value
[09:04:35] <Cork> raskel: then just have the server check that the two values match before it allow updates
[09:05:15] <raskel> cork, so there il be an request on every second though the answer will be conditionated by that?
[09:05:29] <Cork> raskel: no
[09:05:45] <Cork> raskel: the request happens when the user loads the page
[09:05:54] <Cork> and the check happens when they send in the data
[09:06:21] <Cork> raskel: it means that the user has to reload the notes to save though
[09:06:30] <BillCriswell> Manaus: However you're loading that content you would need to trigger the event in the call back. $('.el').load('/foo', function(){ $('.el').find('.link').trigger('click'); });
[09:06:51] <Cork> as only through reloading can they get the new "update" value so they are allowed to update
[09:07:15] <raskel> Cork, i do understand better now. thanks.
[09:07:37] <Cork> raskel: after having that check added, you can start miticating the effects on the user
[09:07:44] <Manaus> I need to attach a fancybox open, but can't work if attached to $(document)
[09:07:52] <Cork> by adding "old/new" displays for example
[09:08:33] <Manaus> tried $.fancybod() within the $(document).on(click...  but no result
[09:09:05] <BillCriswell> Manaus: You'd have to set up a fiddle so we can understand your goal a little better.
[09:09:07] <duch_kazatel> "fancybod"  sounds like a weird plastic surgery thing
[09:09:14] <axscode> $(this).parent('div').append("<div class='mybox'></div>"); <-- hi guys how can i append this with animation like sliding down.
[09:09:23] <Manaus> lol
[09:09:55] <duch_kazatel> axscode you append it with css that sets it to display: none; then animate the new element like any other.
[09:12:57] <axscode> thanks duch, works well :p
[09:13:08] <duch_kazatel> word
[09:13:29] <axscode> word?
[09:13:52] <duch_kazatel> you know - like street youths would say.  i'm gangster, you see.
[09:14:13] <axscode> hehe... :p thanks brotha
[09:19:17] <Mateo_> Hi everyone !
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> hello
[09:20:50] <Mateo_> I’m working on a phonegap app, but have a question with jQuery mobile. I’d like to attach an event to a button placed on a page. The page is not the first displayed. Do I have to do something special to bind that event ?
[09:21:09] <Mateo_> Let’s say it’s for the #record button, on the #recordPage page
[09:21:16] <duch_kazatel> yes - either use event delegation, or bind it when that page loads.
[09:21:21] <duch_kazatel> (do the former)
[09:21:36] <duch_kazatel> wait do those pages actually load separately?  or are they just hidden?
[09:22:02] <Mateo_> Non non, I use the classic markup. All the pages are in the index.html
[09:22:07] <Mateo_> sorry “no no” :)
[09:22:21] <duch_kazatel> then you can just bind normally and it should just work.
[09:22:45] <Mateo_> Oh ok.
[09:22:55] <Mateo_> And duch_kazatel , by any chance, do you use Phonegap ?
[09:22:59] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:23:49] <Mateo_> Ok ! So thanks anyway.
[09:38:56] <BinaryKitten> what's the best way to say "If the body has a class that has _ajax_ in it?"
[09:39:23] <BinaryKitten> i've tried bodyTag.is('[class|=_ajax_')
[09:39:28] <BinaryKitten> but that seems to not work
[09:39:47] <Cork> BinaryKitten: you don't
[09:39:59] <BinaryKitten> Cork darn
[09:40:02] <duch_kazatel> you could grab the body's class and parse it.
[09:40:03] <Cork> you split the class name up into several classes
[09:40:13] <duch_kazatel> *classes
[09:41:06] <Cork> BinaryKitten: so ex class="process_ajax_request" becomes class="process ajax request"
[09:41:20] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: bodyTag.attr('class').indexOf('_ajax_') > -1 wouldn't work?
[09:41:26] <Cork> BinaryKitten: you can do selection with all of them $('.process.ajax.request')
[09:41:29] <Cork> and everything else
[09:41:58] <BinaryKitten> Cork unfortunately that's not applicable
[09:42:01] <BillCriswell> bodyTag.is('[class*=_ajax_]') as well?
[09:42:36] <BinaryKitten> there are 3 (atm) ajax requests. This is to prevent navigation away during the ajax requests
[09:42:48] <BinaryKitten> (in html navigation rather than browser based)
[09:43:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah BillCriswell's suggestions should work.
[09:44:18] <duch_kazatel> or create a var somewhere that you use to track if there are active requests.
[09:44:19] <BinaryKitten> yep i misread the | version
[09:44:29] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel i wish i could do that
[09:44:47] <BinaryKitten> since there are 6 different things all working independently
[09:44:56] <BinaryKitten> and they're not allowed to cross pollunate
[09:45:36] <duch_kazatel> ah
[09:46:12] <BillCriswell> Ugh, why do people want to create CSS with javascript.
[09:46:24] <duch_kazatel> because they have no common sense.
[09:46:31] <BillCriswell> I should just stay away from reading articles.
[09:47:24] <BinaryKitten> create css with javascript?
[09:47:24] <BillCriswell> { ".foo .bar": { "color":"red" } } Haaa
[09:47:50] <BinaryKitten> i don't mind sass-js
[09:47:57] <BinaryKitten> but that makes me cry bigkevmcd
[09:48:00] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell even
[09:48:12] <BillCriswell> I was reading this BinaryKitten: http://davidwalsh.name/write-css-javascript
[09:48:35] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Not familiar with sass-js.
[09:48:51] <BinaryKitten> its JS compiler for Sass
[09:49:02] <duch_kazatel> oh kind of like less-js
[09:49:07] <BinaryKitten> yeah
[09:49:22] <BinaryKitten> mostly used in node
[09:50:15] <BillCriswell> Oh, I use libsass whenever I possibly can.
[09:56:35] <bberry> Why is regular js unable to get height from the element but jquery can? http://jsfiddle.net/3wqz7/
[09:57:01] <duch_kazatel> bberry because the style property doesn't have a height.
[09:57:20] <bberry> well it does. but its just empty string
[09:58:31] <duch_kazatel> right, because the style property on that object doesn't have a declared height.  you want the computed style.
[09:58:40] <bberry> like, is there a method to use in basic js to fill out the style object?
[09:59:02] <duch_kazatel> you want window.getComputedStyle()
[09:59:45] <bberry> k. do i run it on my element, or just on window?
[10:00:26] <BillCriswell> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.getComputedStyle
[10:00:26] <duch_kazatel> window is the global object, so you could just do getComputedStyle(element)
[10:00:46] <bberry> ah, takes an input
[10:00:48] <bberry> thx
[10:01:38] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/3wqz7/2/
[10:02:58] <bberry> cool
[10:10:03] <BillCriswell> Recently I've felt uncomfortable with head phones in at work. Not sure how that started to happen.
[10:11:23] <thebope> BillCriswell, Really? I wish I had a quieter office
[10:11:28] <thebope> but I use headphones a lot
[10:12:57] <duch_kazatel> uncomfortable how?
[10:13:15] <BillCriswell> thebope: Mine is really quiet but I feel like I shouldn't have them in for one reason or another.
[10:13:20] <BillCriswell> Can't quite figure it out haha.
[10:13:37] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to fight it now haha
[10:13:42] <thebope> hmm I like working without music more generally
[10:13:49] <thebope> But I can't do the overear for a long time
[10:14:00] <duch_kazatel> i know a few folks who've gone through that before. i use headphones for getting into "the zone".
[10:14:03] <thebope> so I use the little buds Apple gives with the new iPhones now. They're not bad
[10:14:16] <BillCriswell> thebope: Yeah that's what I use.
[10:14:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm not sure it helps me get in the zone haha.
[10:14:30] <BillCriswell> I change my music way too often.
[10:14:32] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  some folks are like that.
[10:14:53] <thebope> I put the same playlist on every day
[10:15:00] <BillCriswell> I also rarely finish an entire song without switching to something else. Drives my friends nuts.
[10:15:09] <BillCriswell> thebope: I too listen to the same thing a lot.
[10:15:09] <thebope> so its so normal I can zone in even though I find music I don't listen to often distracting
[10:15:25] <thebope> because I actually want to listen to it when I don't know it so well haha
[10:15:36] <thebope> I keep adding to the playlist though
[10:15:45] <thebope> BillCriswell, yea I think it helps
[10:16:55] <duch_kazatel> i have a few different playlists I use.  really depends on what's going on.
[10:18:16] <Mateo_> Anyone using Phonegap and jQuery please ? I have some questions (probably easy :) )
[10:18:49] <Mateo_> I’d like to know where is the best place to add my event binding in the default main.js
[10:19:56] <duch_kazatel> Mateo_ Wherever you'd like to?
[10:21:44] <thebope> That is the best place. Then it's right where you'd like it. Not one line too high. Not one line too low.
[10:21:52] <thebope> And they say this isn't an art
[10:21:59] <duch_kazatel> a happy little binding.
[10:22:03] <duch_kazatel> devops bob ross ++
[10:22:11] <thebope> hahaha
[10:22:16] <thebope> Now type after me
[10:22:24] <duch_kazatel> that's a real thing btw: https://twitter.com/DevOps_BobRoss
[10:22:36] <Manaus> hi, can't google "$." (too short?), any suggestion?
[10:22:42] <duch_kazatel> jQuery
[10:22:52] <duch_kazatel> or ask us your specific question.
[10:23:15] <Manaus> thanks, whats the difference between $( and $.
[10:23:21] <duch_kazatel> Manaus huh?
[10:23:31] <duch_kazatel> you mean $() and $?
[10:23:39] <Manaus> yes sort of
[10:23:47] <duch_kazatel> clarify, because that's a loaded question.
[10:23:49] <Manaus> I see a plugin attached to $.theplugin
[10:23:58] <duch_kazatel> ah, $ is the jquery object.
[10:24:07] <duch_kazatel> $() is calling that object as a function.
[10:24:20] <thebope> followed
[10:24:38] <duch_kazatel> functions are objects in javascript, so they have properties like any other object.
[10:24:57] <Manaus> so it's the same thing used in two different ways
[10:25:38] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:25:41] <duch_kazatel> well, sort of.
[10:25:49] <duch_kazatel> $ is the object, $() is calling the function.
[10:26:36] <Manaus> is it the top level function, with all the subfuncs (on, fade etc) attached
[10:26:54] <duch_kazatel> $ is the top level object.  the methods are all under $.fn iirc
[10:27:38] <duch_kazatel> $.fn is where things are put that you want to run as methods against selected stuff.
[10:27:52] <Manaus> why am I calling a method with $() and not $.fn()
[10:28:04] <duch_kazatel> because $() is a constructor.
[10:28:10] <duch_kazatel> and it'd be $.fn.on()
[10:28:30] <Manaus> very interesting
[10:29:07] <duch_kazatel> when you run $(), you're creating a new object.  so when you do $('#myThing').on('click', function() { console.log('butts') });, you're running a constructor that creates a new object, then attaching an event listener.
[10:29:08] <Manaus> so a $.createWorld() is a plugin attaching a method to the top level object
[10:29:16] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[10:29:34] <Manaus> like $.ajax
[10:29:42] <duch_kazatel> eeeexactly.
[10:29:57] <Manaus> they don't need a dom element to run
[10:29:59] <duch_kazatel> i highly suggest reading up on your javascript - you'll have that "a-ha" moment with this stuff
[10:30:44] <Manaus> yes so many things to study, and often I miss the gaps between the steps
[10:30:56] <duch_kazatel> go back and read up on your JS :)
[10:31:08] <Manaus> thanks duch_kazatel
[10:31:15] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[10:33:07] <duch_kazatel> i love that my company has decided that (cornholio) should be an emoticon.
[10:34:05] <Manaus> lol
[10:36:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Does that mean anything outside of Beavis and Butthead?
[10:37:02] <duch_kazatel> nope.  it's exactly what you think it is.
[10:37:07] <BillCriswell> Nice.
[10:37:12] <duch_kazatel> you do (cornholio), you get the image of beavis as corholio
[10:37:21] <BillCriswell> Perfect.
[10:37:42] <BillCriswell> Are you threatening me?
[10:37:50] <duch_kazatel> heh heheheheheh FIRE heehehehehehe
[10:38:08] <BillCriswell> I really love Mike Judge.
[10:38:25] <duch_kazatel> offtopic: anybody have any suggestions for a blogging site thinger for github pages that doesn't use markdown?
[10:39:44] <duch_kazatel> or is it pretty trivial to swap that part out?
[10:40:39] <heihei> How can I get a list of all required form elements not yet filled out?
[10:40:39] <thebope> Have you guys seen his new show? Silicon Valley?
[10:40:45] <thebope> i heard it was pretty good
[10:41:08] <BillCriswell> thebope: It is getting a lot better as it progresses. I was not interested at first but I stuck it out.
[10:41:24] <duch_kazatel> heihei no way to know unless you tell us what you're using for validation.
[10:41:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I think you have options. It essentially runs jekyll underneath from what I gather?
[10:41:30] <BinaryKitten> ok i have a text field. I know it's there because i console.log it out prior to the error start. in the input i call .trigger('change') and end up with Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function jquery.js:4641
[10:41:59] <BinaryKitten> i've followed the stack and not sure where it gets lost
[10:42:14] <duch_kazatel> you runn jekyll to generate shit that you push up.  octopress is the same way.  any static site generater should work though on second though.
[10:42:19] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Can you show us the trigger line?
[10:43:58] <BinaryKitten> var txt = div.find('input:text'); txt.trigger('change');
[10:44:27] <heihei> duch_kazatel:just using "required" attribute.
[10:44:43] <BinaryKitten> between the var and trigger i have a console.log which is correctly outputting the input field
[10:45:19] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten console.log(txt) - make sure it exists?
[10:45:28] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel --- read ^
[10:45:38] <BinaryKitten> lol
[10:45:49] <BinaryKitten> this is why this is driving me bonkers
[10:45:53] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[10:46:02] <duch_kazatel> can you show us more code?
[10:46:39] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: That should work.
[10:46:48] <BinaryKitten> duch_kazatel yes, but without html context i'm afraid
[10:47:00] <duch_kazatel> BinaryKitten better than nothing.
[10:47:23] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: http://jsbin.com/filazeso/1/edit?html,js,output
[10:47:32] <BinaryKitten> http://jsbin.com/jutumela/1/edit
[10:47:43] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell yeah, i know it should work.
[10:48:07] <BinaryKitten> this is why i've been bashing my head against the keyboard for the last hour :p
[10:49:49] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: div.slideDown('slow').find('input:text') What should this be doing exactly?
[10:50:20] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell nothing
[10:50:38] <BinaryKitten> the find should be removed
[10:50:49] <BillCriswell> Ok, just making sure!
[10:50:53] <BinaryKitten> :D
[10:51:18] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: What if you do console.log(txt.val());
[10:51:38] <BinaryKitten> it outputs an empty string
[10:52:15] <duch_kazatel> heihei all the required attribute does is verify the input was filled, right?
[10:52:20] <BillCriswell> Before you empty it?
[10:53:27] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell unless i type something into the text field prior yes
[10:56:24] <heihei> actually...this.validity.valid combined with html5 form elements should do it
[10:57:35] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7G7P7/1/ there you go.
[10:57:36] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[10:58:05] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: I have no idea.
[10:58:06] <duch_kazatel> oh derpingtons i was looking at the jquery object not the DOM object.
[10:58:13] <diamonds> loading jquery via require.js...
[10:58:25] <diamonds> jasmine-jquery module relies explicitly on window.jQuery
[10:58:41] <diamonds> how can I force jquery to attach to `window` in require.js?
[10:59:16] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell not sure myself
[10:59:38] <heihei> duch_kazatel: exactly...even works on specific input types. input type="email
[10:59:38] <BinaryKitten> hoping it's a declaration order issue in a.n.other script
[10:59:44] <duch_kazatel> yep
[10:59:46] <heihei> thanks
[11:00:52] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Yeah, has so be something outside of it.
[11:00:58] <BillCriswell> outside of jQuery.
[11:01:48] <BinaryKitten> yeah
[11:01:50] <BinaryKitten> it was
[11:02:09] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Nice.
[11:02:12] <BillCriswell> Kind of.
[11:02:15] <BinaryKitten> another script was .on('change', blahFunction);
[11:02:45] <BinaryKitten> blahFunction was a function declaration, but that got changed to a var blahFunction = function() { }
[11:02:58] <ajf-> How do I list all functions bound to 'beforeunload' through $(window).on('beforeunload', ... ) ; ?
[11:03:07] <BinaryKitten> since the .on was prior to the var it was binding undefined to the handler
[11:03:56] <BillCriswell> Yuck.
[11:04:22] <duch_kazatel> ajf- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/446892/how-to-find-event-listeners-on-a-dom-node
[11:04:51] <ajf-> Thanks
[11:04:54] <duch_kazatel> ajf- for jquery events, jQuery._data( elem, "events" );
[11:05:41] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell thanks for listening and helping elliminate the obvious
[11:05:42] <BinaryKitten> :D
[11:06:20] <BillCriswell> Eliminating the obvious is what I'm best at... cause that's what it normally is haha
[11:06:33] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell yeah i know.
[11:06:36] <BillCriswell> In my experience anyway.
[11:06:54] <BinaryKitten> i even had the chrome debugger and stepping through it
[11:06:58] <BinaryKitten> was like wtf?
[11:08:24] <BillCriswell> I rarely have to go that far luckily.
[11:08:32] <BillCriswell> I also don't work on anything too crazy though.
[11:09:22] <BinaryKitten> heh
[11:09:33] <BinaryKitten> you should seen some of the js stuff i've done..
[11:09:53] <BinaryKitten> at one point to save performance i ended up doing object.length = 0
[11:10:07] <BinaryKitten> (or arrayVar.length = 0)
[11:15:39] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Sounds scary.
[11:16:11] <BinaryKitten> BillCriswell it was for dynamically loading pages
[11:16:39] <BinaryKitten> meant i could clear the page without triggering garbage collection on every switch
[11:19:53] <BillCriswell> BinaryKitten: Sounds like a good trick haha

[11:56:55] <crash1hd> Uhkis, what do you mean?
[12:00:22] <Uhkis> crash1hd: it's non-empty object which evaluates to true
[12:00:53] <crash1hd> ahhh I see
[12:29:42] <BillCriswell> Ugh, WYSIWGs
[12:29:59] <BillCriswell> WYSIWYG's *
[12:30:19] <duch_kazatel> :(
[12:33:41] <thebope> i heard someone pronounce that like WissEWig a few days ago
[12:33:48] <thebope> *PEW* Mind blown
[12:35:00] <BillCriswell> thebope: Haha I do that.. but it was only after I heard someone say it.
[12:35:12] <BillCriswell> Wiz-W-Wig
[12:35:16] <BillCriswell> sounds like a terrible rapper.
[12:35:19] <thebope> I wonder who said it first
[12:35:20] <BillCriswell> Wiz-E-Wig*
[12:35:27] <thebope> For him, what he saw, was what others got
[12:35:39] <jeffreylevesque> is it possible to move the mouse / cursor with jquery ?
[12:35:51] <thebope> Ive never seen anything do that
[12:36:06] <thebope> You cna trigger things though
[12:36:10] <jeffreylevesque> do you think php or server code could?
[12:36:21] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: No, but you can trigger events that can fake it.
[12:36:21] <jeffreylevesque> i have a flash dialog box popping up
[12:36:24] <jeffreylevesque> it's not in the DOM
[12:36:29] <BillCriswell> That just gave me a fun idea.
[12:36:47] <jeffreylevesque> so i'm going to try to click the cursor for the width of the Flash container
[12:37:06] <jeffreylevesque> repetitively until it clicks the flash button
[12:40:27] <BillCriswell> jeffreylevesque: You can't move the actual mouse according to my 5 seconds of googlin.
[12:54:13] <uskerine> can anyone recommend a good example on how to load a table using DataTables plugin?
[12:55:56] <BillCriswell> uskerine: There must be an example of that on the site, right?
[12:56:17] <uskerine> yeah and I am trying to get it running -without success-
[12:56:46] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Is there any errors in the developers tools?
[12:57:37] <BillCriswell> uskerine: http://www.datatables.net/examples/basic_init/zero_configuration.html this seems straight forward.
[12:57:38] <uskerine> BillCriswell, I have this in a loaded .hs: http://pastebin.com/kfbL3dMc
[12:57:44] <uskerine> .js*
[12:57:56] <uskerine> but no alert is presented, may I assume that it is not even reaching this point
[12:57:58] <uskerine> I am new to jquery
[12:58:50] <BillCriswell> Yes, you should definitely get an alert.
[12:59:36] <BillCriswell> The documentation for this thing is pretty good ( for the basic stuff at least ).
[13:00:53] <uskerine> I think that I am not dealing with datatables *yet*
[13:01:01] <uskerine> any idea on why I won't be getting that alert?
[13:01:05] <uskerine> the .js is included
[13:01:14] <uskerine> and it has just the pastebin i used
[13:01:35] <uskerine> jquery is, of course, previously loaded
[13:01:37] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You need to include jquery and the datatables plugin as well.
[13:01:43] <uskerine> both done
[13:01:44] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Did you check the console for errors?
[13:01:54] <BillCriswell> The very first thing, always, is that.
[13:02:06] <uskerine> mmm
[13:02:13] <uskerine> there is an error because i remove one item fromthe DOM
[13:02:17] <uskerine> which i guess stop the execution
[13:02:18] <uskerine> right?
[13:02:48] <BillCriswell> Sounds likely.
[13:03:53] <uskerine> yeah, that was the issue
[13:03:58] <uskerine> thanks i will try to deal with the documentation now
[13:04:30] <BillCriswell> Nice. Need anything else let us know!
[13:22:25] <martinrame> Hi, is there a way to POST a form without using ajax. I need to get an application/octet-stream and download to the client.
[13:24:52] <duch_kazatel> martinrame sure - use a normal form.
[13:25:04] <duch_kazatel> if you need to avoid having the entire page refresh, use an iframe for the form.
[13:29:31] <uskerine> I have the current datatables definition: http://jsfiddle.net/L2SHS/
[13:29:47] <uskerine> and I would like to load it with the following data -just an example-:
[13:29:54] <uskerine> http://jsonblob.com/537bbaeae4b087d6a46c3fa9
[13:30:21] <uskerine> any tip on where to start would be helpful
[13:31:48] <__joshua___> here is an example, uskerine: http://datatables.net/examples/data_sources/js_array.html
[13:32:11] <__joshua___> just give the 'data' options to the datatables constructor
[13:34:23] <uskerine> my data comes from a server
[13:35:18] <uskerine> so I would need to have the datatable making an AJAX request to a server
[13:36:25] <uskerine> just to avoid troubleshooting two things at the same time I was thinking in using first jsonblob.com before programming the service on the server side
[13:43:26] <Velveeta> uskerine: so is your problem that the json you're handing to it isn't working, or is it that it's coming from a different domain and your browser is choking on it?
[13:46:01] <uskerine> :-o
[13:46:05] <uskerine> didn't think about that
[13:46:14] <__joshua___> you should see error in your console
[13:46:22] <__joshua___> if its a cross domain issue
[13:46:30] <uskerine> but I am actually more into having datatables loading the data, i am new to JSON, Jquery and datatables
[13:46:57] <uskerine> so i was just trying to put the example online to make easier to understand
[13:47:33] <__joshua___> if you pass 'ajax' option with url to fetch it should work.
[13:47:48] <__joshua___> Unless.... you have domain issues
[13:48:31] <martinrame> Usin $.ajax I can send json in the "data" field using "JSON.stringify(mydata)". Is there a way to send Json POST data without ajax?.
[13:49:37] <__joshua___> you mean submit a form with a json value in one of the fields?
[13:50:16] <__joshua___> you want to post data, but you don't want to use ajax?  that will require a page submit
[13:51:03] <martinrame> __joshua___: In fact I would like to know what the "data" field of the $.ajax function does, I need to do exactly that, but without using ajax.
[13:51:32] <martinrame> __joshua___: I've tried setting a hidden value with the JSON.stringigy..., but the data is different.
[13:52:14] <uskerine> __joshua___ so if i do: "ajax": "/myAjaxService", and myAjaxService returns this: http://jsonblob.com/537bbaeae4b087d6a46c3fa9
[13:52:16] <__joshua___> hmm ok.  IF a 'get', the data field becomes appended to the URL as a query string
[13:52:18] <uskerine> would I be on the right track?
[13:52:29] <__joshua___> is a POST, then it becomes the POST params
[13:52:59] <__joshua___> uskerine: i believe so
[13:53:05] <uskerine> thanks, i will try
[13:54:55] <__joshua___> martinrame: i can't recommend this, but....
[13:54:58] <__joshua___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/E1UjxYKY
[13:55:51] <__joshua___> will create a form pointing to your url, append your data as field, then POST submit that form
[13:56:23] <martinrame> __joshua___: thanks, I'll take a look at it.
[13:58:04] <il> hello
[13:59:02] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[14:01:42] <Velveeta> martinrame: what __joshua___ told you is pretty spot on with that snippet... in order to pass an object of some kind, to be shipped via post transmission without using ajax, you'd have to parameterize that object first, and then create hidden inputs out of those key/value pairs to post with the form
[14:14:00] <uskerine> i tried this in datatables: "ajax": "/getCustomerList"
[14:14:16] <uskerine> where /getCustomerList returns http://jsonblob.com/537bbaeae4b087d6a46c3fa9
[14:14:24] <uskerine> but nothing happens, no erros in console
[14:14:27] <uskerine> errors*
[14:14:58] <uskerine> anyone  with experience with datatables and ajax who could give any tip?
[14:16:20] <uskerine>  current jquery for that datatable is: http://pastebin.com/YMKEGxRV
[14:18:00] <__joshua___> perhaps its "sAjaxSource": data_url,
[14:18:58] <duch_kazatel> docs say i't's 'ajax'
[14:18:59] <uskerine> It is improving, now datatable is "loading"
[14:18:59] <uskerine> :)
[14:19:28] <hugg> Hey, does anyone use Progression.js?
[14:19:51] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ hugg
[14:19:54] <b-ot> hugg: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:20:32] <uskerine> i see, that jQuery -or datatables- are appending this as parameter to the request:  _1400624969014
[14:20:44] <duch_kazatel> uskerine that's for cachebusting.
[14:21:15] <hugg> duch_kazatel: My actual question is whether anyone really uses progression.js. But thanks for the great tip.
[14:21:41] <uskerine> i think i found it, i forgot to include the context name
[14:22:00] <uskerine> it is client side, so it does not know anything about app
[14:22:03] <uskerine> i was getting 404
[14:22:03] <duch_kazatel> hugg fair enough.
[14:22:46] <hugg> duch_kazatel: ^_^
[14:25:47] <uskerine> so server is answering with the right data, and datatable displays "loading"
[14:25:53] <uskerine> but nothing else happens
[14:25:59] <uskerine> I guess that i am not using the right format to pass the data
[14:26:39] <uskerine> For this datatable, does anyone know what data should retrieve the Ajax service? http://jsfiddle.net/L2SHS/
[14:27:10] <uskerine> my service is returning now this: http://jsonblob.com/537bbaeae4b087d6a46c3fa9
[14:27:22] <uskerine> i have also tried to retrieve 5 columsn instead of 3
[14:27:23] <duch_kazatel> -> http://jsfiddle.net/L2SHS/1/ with better js formatting
[14:28:31] <uskerine> in my test server that definition has at the end: "sAjaxSource": "/myApp/getCustomerList"
[14:34:50] <naeluh_cork> yo!
[14:34:57] <duch_kazatel> heyo
[14:39:49] <naeluh_cork> whats the good wurd !!
[14:39:59] <naeluh_cork> tues has gotta be my favorite day !
[14:42:18] <duch_kazatel> hahaha oh?
[14:42:20] <duch_kazatel> why tuesday?
[14:54:24] <duch_kazatel> so excited he disappeared!
[14:57:10] <CrowX-> it's tuesday after all
[14:57:22] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[14:57:34] <duch_kazatel> to be fair, today was incredible for me.
[14:58:10] <CrowX-> how
[14:58:32] <duch_kazatel> got my first paycheck with my raise on it AND I got my quartely bonus.
[14:58:44] <duch_kazatel> the raise was pretty substantial, too.
[14:59:35] <CrowX-> nice :)
[15:00:03] <duch_kazatel> very.  30% - they hired me low so they wanted to make up for that plus the raise for the promotion.
[15:01:16] <CrowX-> you must be good at your work then
[15:01:23] <CrowX-> what's your job position, what do you do?
[15:02:01] <duch_kazatel> job title change pending right now while they figure out what the new titles are going to be accross the department.
[15:02:15] <duch_kazatel> I'm basically a Sr. Software Developer.
[15:02:57] <CrowX-> javascript?
[15:03:04] <duch_kazatel> mostly.
[15:03:07] <duch_kazatel> HTML/CSS/JS.
[15:03:15] <duch_kazatel> plus coldfusion.
[15:05:22] <uskerine> in case someone is interested, the JSON object should be returned under "aaData" instead of "data"
[15:05:43] <uskerine> now it works, thanks a lot for your help, it put me on the right track
[15:20:08] <mrblinko> Hi, does anyone know any good resources for datatables.net library, possible better examples/ tutorials?
[15:20:40] <mrblinko> I am trying to integrate it into symfony2 but I am having alot of trouble understanding how to connect the two, i think if i had more references for datatables then i will be better off.
[15:21:11] <uskerine> mrblinko i just did my first example with java (java returning JSON object)
[15:21:15] <uskerine> -in case it helps
[15:22:16] <mrblinko> not sure, i dont have any experience with java but may not be of help since symfony2 is a framework in php, thanks though I appreciate attempt
[15:22:17] <uskerine> i think that if you return JSON you don't care what you have on the server side
[15:22:25] <mrblinko> realy
[15:22:31] <duch_kazatel> mrblinko yeah just return json.
[15:22:34] <duch_kazatel> the server-side doesn't matter.
[15:22:44] <duch_kazatel> that's why we have normalized languages for transmission.
[15:22:44] <mrblinko> so aslong as the json object is appropriately formatted, the datatables library will do the rest like magic?
[15:22:52] <duch_kazatel> it basically should.
[15:22:55] <uskerine> right mrblinko, it does
[15:23:24] <duch_kazatel> it's like HTML - the browser doesn't care what server you're running.
[15:23:27] <uskerine> but as you say, the examples are not so good (they are not bad either but at least in my case it was not straightforward)
[15:23:34] <mrblinko> hmm, then perhaps i am doing something horribly wroung, i force the example json object they have at datatables.net and it wont update the table
[15:23:43] <uskerine> mrblinko
[15:23:48] <duch_kazatel> mrblinko are you SURE you're outputting that data?
[15:23:49] <uskerine> show me your JSON object
[15:23:57] <uskerine> with firebug
[15:24:02] <uskerine> you can see all the "NET" events
[15:24:11] <duch_kazatel> chrome's dev tools can do that, too.
[15:24:18] <duch_kazatel> same with FF's built-in tools.
[15:24:18] <uskerine> and you will see the AJAX request and response from your server (with the JSON object)
[15:24:45] <mrblinko> i am using chrome, under network tab and select the post page sent back from the ajax, hold up let me get it for you in pastebin or gist
[15:24:52] <duch_kazatel> gist/.
[15:24:54] <duch_kazatel> not pastebin.
[15:26:13] <mrblinko> sorry its not formatted well, https://gist.github.com/JaronAPM/7b7a2067e59fd2d4641d
[15:26:44] <duch_kazatel> supply a valid example duder.
[15:27:08] <mrblinko> alrighty hold on, i will give better context
[15:27:10] <mrblinko> :P
[15:27:11] <duch_kazatel> fixed.
[15:27:13] <duch_kazatel> nevermind.
[15:27:15] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4D63h/
[15:27:21] <duch_kazatel> you were missing a closing curly.
[15:27:59] <uskerine> mrblinko
[15:28:03] <uskerine> with my version of datatables
[15:28:09] <uskerine> data must be replaced with aaData
[15:28:22] <uskerine> i got stuck with "loading data..." after the AJAX request
[15:28:51] <mrblinko> hmm
[15:29:09] <mrblinko> ok let me see about this missing curly, i have the object being build from an array
[15:31:07] <mrblinko> I dont understand the missing curly?
[15:31:17] <mrblinko> i will look into aaData though
[15:35:08] <mrblinko> I added the html and js for the data table, http://jsfiddle.net/4D63h/
[15:35:22] <mrblinko> n/m
[15:36:09] <mrblinko> http://jsfiddle.net/k6MHC/
[15:36:39] <mrblinko> I am not using the datatables api to generate the table on click but the table should be generating properly on load regardless?
[15:37:11] <uskerine> mrblinko, just in case it helps. A working html/jquery example is here: http://pastebin.com/d9eeLnAe
[15:37:27] <uskerine> and the JSON object returned by the AJAX service is here: http://jsonblob.com/537bbaeae4b087d6a46c3fa9
[15:37:56] <uskerine> the table should be populated automatically
[15:38:02] <uskerine> you do not need to do anything else
[15:38:08] <slu9freek> I've been looking around, and everything I've read suggests .remove() clears all styles (e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17907392/how-do-i-remove-all-styles-from-an-element-using-jquery); however, this is not my experience in practice. I am creating a number of elements, deleting them, and readding them, but the get recreated with their old style. How do I avoid this?
[15:38:16] <mrblinko> ok cool, this should be helpful then, thanks a bunch!
[15:38:52] <uskerine> I am not sure if aoColumns is actually needed, this is my first datatables example
[15:39:34] <mrblinko> its something different to try so it would be worth it
[15:39:48] <duch_kazatel> slu9freek huh?  what does removing something have to do with adding something else?
[15:40:03] <duch_kazatel> slu9freek are you styling things using js?
[15:40:53] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: no, I'm adding an element with a class that is styled in my css. then I'm animating it with jQuery before removing it.
[15:41:08] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: let me give you more context
[15:41:20] <duch_kazatel> could you paste up some code to show what you're doing?
[15:43:17] <mrblinko> <uskerine> I tried the solutions you guys have suggested, things look like they should be working but still do not :(
[15:43:25] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: I'm creating cell images with the class 'cell' and an id like 'cancerCell4' where 4 increments with each new cell. I select the cell by id, then animate it. I then remove all the cells by decrementing my cancerCell counter. and calling remove(). If I add a new cell with the same id later, it starts where it was removed, not where it originally started. I'll paste some code, one sec./
[15:43:33] <mrblinko> thanks for the help anyways though, will look continue looking for answers
[15:43:55] <uskerine> :( sorry to hear mrblinko, check your JSON object with the browser
[15:44:17] <uskerine> in my case it worked  just with what I pasted to you
[15:44:38] <mrblinko> it is for sure generating properly, the type is seen as application/json and the object itself when view in chrome/network looks right
[15:44:44] <mrblinko> thanks though!
[15:45:10] <mrblinko> oh, for the table pre data, does it need empty data <tr>
[15:45:10] <mrblinko> ?
[15:45:15] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: http://people.ucsc.edu/~dmtucker/art/cancer/script.js
[15:45:36] <uskerine> i used empty tbody, but headers where included
[15:45:37] <duch_kazatel> :(
[15:45:40] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: check out makeTumor and removeCancer
[15:46:14] <duch_kazatel> that's a lot of code - can you pair down your question at all?
[15:46:37] <mrblinko> hmm, added empty <tbody></tbody> but still no cigar, thanks though :)
[15:46:43] <mrblinko> i am getting close i can feel it
[15:46:47] <uskerine> sorry to hear
[15:46:50] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: Yes, how do I clear styling on an ID (.remove() doesn't do it)?
[15:47:11] <uskerine> keep on it mrblinko, it is wonderful when you see the data populate
[15:47:21] <mrblinko> lol, thanks
[15:47:23] <uskerine> and it saves lots of time, you know all the pagination and filtering and stuff
[15:47:44] <duch_kazatel> slu9freek $('#theId').removeAttr('style');
[15:47:48] <duch_kazatel> that might do it.
[15:48:04] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: nice, ok i'll give that a try, thanks
[15:51:21] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: no go...
[15:52:19] <duch_kazatel> slu9freek can you setup a functining fiddle then?
[15:52:31] <duch_kazatel> i'd really rather not read through all of your code.
[15:53:50] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: ya, I'm trying overwriting the style before removing, then I'll fiddle
[15:57:05] <sledgeDJ> i have a php page i created. now some ppl want to be able to include it on their pages as like a widget what is the best way to give them some javascript code to put on their pages to make this happen? can it be done?
[15:57:27] <duch_kazatel> whaaaaa
[15:57:40] <duch_kazatel> you can give them code that writes out an iframe or ajxes content in i guess/
[15:57:55] <sledgeDJ> which do you think is better?
[15:58:00] <duch_kazatel> neither.
[15:58:04] <sledgeDJ> lol
[15:58:10] <duch_kazatel> without knowing what the widget does.
[15:58:14] <duch_kazatel> it being PHP is irrelevant
[15:58:38] <sledgeDJ> here is an example
[15:58:44] <sledgeDJ> still work in progress
[15:58:45] <sledgeDJ> http://bitcoinchaser.com/widget/
[15:58:46] <duch_kazatel> dunno why it needs to involve javascript.
[15:58:57] <sledgeDJ> ok so without JS what is best way?
[15:59:00] <duch_kazatel> iframe it.
[15:59:45] <sledgeDJ> ok simple might be best
[15:59:46] <sledgeDJ> thanks
[16:02:03] <duch_kazatel> otherwise you're going to be in for a world of pain trying to deal with writing a stable injection deal.  really not worth it imo.
[16:05:29] <mrblinko> I have this jsfiddle that should demonstrate a very simple datatable on document data populate but it is not going through, am I setting it up improperly?  http://jsfiddle.net/A9T5a/
[16:06:17] <duch_kazatel> look at your console, mrblinko
[16:06:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/A9T5a/1/
[16:07:32] <mrblinko> eeeh, double tbody
[16:09:19] <duch_kazatel> and javascript errors ;)
[16:11:53] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/HEj7k/    line 16 is where things are messed up
[16:14:48] <duch_kazatel> first off, don't use setTimeout.
[16:15:03] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[16:15:05] <duch_kazatel> use this.
[16:15:34] <duch_kazatel> I'll bet this is the first part of the problem.
[16:15:42] <duch_kazatel> refactor time :)
[16:16:30] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel:
[16:16:33] <slu9freek> lol...
[16:16:37] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:16:40] <mrblinko> shazbot i got it, to many rows, http://jsfiddle.net/A9T5a/3/
[16:17:13] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: (hit enter too soon, sry) I'm not using setTimeout in the actual code... but doesnt delay only work for jQuery shtuff?
[16:18:17] <duch_kazatel> sure... are you using .animate() in your code?
[16:18:55] <duch_kazatel> brb
[16:19:11] <slu9freek> duch_kazatel: yes, I usually do $(...).delay(...).animate(...);
[16:23:02] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: switched computers...
[16:27:57] <duch_kazatel> back
[16:28:19] <duch_kazatel> ish
[16:44:24] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: the only idea i have atm is to add an inline style to the after call, but I'm not even sure that would work.
[16:45:17] <thoraxe> http://jsfiddle.net/8Y9L5/ I feel like this should work, but it doesn't... the ID is available in the DOM before the javascript, so shouldn't this alert once the page loads?
[16:46:29] <thoraxe> basically once the page loads I want to do something to the content of that form field
[16:49:04] <__joshua___> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[16:49:13] <__joshua___> you need a closing bracket
[16:52:40] <thoraxe> __joshua___: was that for me?
[17:14:35] <sammych> I have an awkward situation where I built a jQM tool that is embedded in a content page, that loads inside a company portal
[17:14:48] <sammych> that results in an iFrame inside an iFrame
[17:15:09] <sammych> this is not a bad situation on desktop, not a problem at all
[17:15:24] <sammych> it totally stuffs up scrolling though
[17:15:27] <sammych> on mobile
[17:16:21] <sammych> there's a solution, but I have to give up the jQM footer in my tools
[17:16:43] <sammych> by using overflow on the div holding the iFrame
[17:17:57] <piercedwater> 19
[17:19:24] <mrblinko> anyone know where i can find documentation on datatables 1.8, my current project is running it and the current api on datatables.net dont work properly due to being 1.10
[17:21:37] <duch_kazatel> http://legacy.datatables.net/
[17:21:52] <mrblinko> whoa daddy, thanks!
[17:22:19] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/Nwh2gPl.png
[17:23:12] <mrblinko> ah pooh, http://legacy.datatables.net/blog/DataTables_1.8
[17:26:31] <thoraxe> so if i have the contents of a file available in a variable, how can I make the browser download it?
[17:29:52] <__joshua___> a few choices:  the filesystem api,  using <a href="data:" +encodeURI(obj)'>Click</a>, or bounce it from a server
[17:30:04] <thoraxe> well, it never exists on the server, and that's kind of the point
[17:30:15] <__joshua___> thus bounce
[17:30:26] <thoraxe> basically the file contents end up loaded in the browser and i just want to allow the user to click to download it (or have it automatically start downloading)
[17:30:33] <thoraxe> no, i don't ever want the file contents
[17:30:54] <__joshua___> weird
[17:31:18] <__joshua___> then why does the browser get it?
[17:31:26] <hugo_moss> can anyone recommend a jquery image zoom plugin that works on all devices?
[17:31:31] <thoraxe> long story.
[17:31:45] <__joshua___> you upload a file you never read?  for fun?
[17:32:04] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___++
[17:32:13] <thoraxe> "In April 2014, it was announced on public-webapps that the Filesystem API spec should be considered dead. Other browsers have showed little interest in implementing it."
[17:32:19] <thoraxe> so that looks like it's a no-go
[17:33:21] <__joshua___> right, then you either: use flash (uch).  use the a href hack i just showed you, or bounce
[17:35:01] <thoraxe> looks like i need to do some kind of href hack then
[17:36:28] <sammych> this is HTML5 apparently, http://jsfiddle.net/49BJ4/
[17:36:28] <__joshua___> just fwi, Im pretty sure bouncing is the only reliable way to do it, but href or window.location probably works a heap of hte time
[17:36:38] <sammych> for the download via pure JS
[17:36:59] <sammych> I use it to generate CSV from tables
[17:36:59] <__joshua___> right, thats the href hack
[17:37:27] <sammych> is it really a hack?
[17:39:06] <__joshua___> actually, doing the blob means you avoid the usual encoding issues
[17:41:45] <sammych> I got it all from MDN, but it's all HTML5 so if you need support, you'll have to do other things
[17:42:12] <dm7freek> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/HEj7k/1/     works but      http://jsfiddle.net/HEj7k/    doesn't, why?
[17:42:30] <sammych> are cookies still the best way to store temporary data?
[17:42:57] <__joshua___> not really.  if doing modern stuff, you want to localstorage, probably
[17:43:11] <__joshua___> cookies have to be passed on every request to that domain
[17:43:35] <sammych> okay good, ie9 is supported
[17:44:54] <__joshua___> or use a shim that falls back
[17:46:05] <thoraxe> well the problem is i'm using CryptoJS (spare me the javascript encryption is insecure stuff). So, the browser decrypts the stuff, and then the user needs to "download" it out of the browser
[17:46:21] <thoraxe> generating the file on my end kind of defeats the purpose of them using javascript encryption in the first place
[17:47:11] <__joshua___> make sense.  if you can require html5, sammych's solution looks good
[17:47:40] <thoraxe> yeah requiring html5 is kind of the ticket here
[17:47:44] <thoraxe> until we write a real java version
[17:47:47] <thoraxe> and/or mobile app
[17:47:49] <thoraxe> blahblah
[17:48:05] <sammych> I guess, FYI, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[17:52:38] <sammych> i was just about to complain about localstorage, strings, dates and timezones
[17:52:52] <sammych> then I realised, your timezone doesn't matter...because 'local'
[17:58:38] <visualshock> I can do alert("hello"), but not console.log("hello"). What is wrong?
[17:59:38] <thoraxe> sammych: hey your new Blob thing doesn't seem to work for me: 	
[17:59:45] <thoraxe> var blob = new Blob(content, {type : 'text/html'}); -> TypeError: The method parameter is missing or invalid.
[18:00:02] <thoraxe> "content" holds the file contents
[18:00:05] <thoraxe> or so i think
[18:02:38] <sammych> ah, sorry thoraxe, lemme update the fiddle
[18:04:06] <sammych> thoraxe: http://jsfiddle.net/49BJ4/1/
[18:04:25] <sammych> I can confirm that actually works for me :D
[18:04:50] <thoraxe> sammych: i'm not sure how that changes anything on my end
[18:04:56] <thoraxe> content already contains the content of the file
[18:05:20] <sammych> blob needs to take in an array
[18:05:22] <sammych> for some reason
[18:05:26] <thoraxe> derp
[18:05:39] <thoraxe> so i could do [content]
[18:05:45] <sammych> yup
[18:09:18] <thoraxe> hmm, sortof worked so far
[18:14:38] <sammych> is there an easy to find out the total network data used to load a page?
[18:15:17] <sammych> so all real data, so not the data transfer for cached files
[18:15:25] <sammych> etc etc
[18:16:07] <thoraxe> sammych: so your stuff works. the part that's not working is cryptojs. need to figure that out
[18:16:17] <sammych> glad I could help
[18:16:18] <thoraxe> sammych: seems to work fine for text files, but for non-text files it does something odd
[18:16:30] <thoraxe> i am guessing it's some kind of character encoding issue or something
[18:16:34] <sammych> likely
[18:17:24] <sammych> did you pick the right mime type?
[18:17:30] <__joshua___> thoraxe: are you doing the ahref download?  did you change the mime type/
[18:17:33] <sammych> or does that really not change the handling of the data
[18:17:52] <sammych> in the Blob contructor
[18:18:00] <thoraxe> __joshua___: i don't think that's actually the issue. does chagning the mime type change the actual content that gets downloaded?
[18:18:21] <sammych> it might affect the way the app reading it though
[18:19:41] <__joshua___> it probably effects the way  window.URL.createObjectURL (just guessing)
[18:19:45] <thoraxe> well i'm downloading the file to disk
[18:19:48] <thoraxe> then opening it with an app
[18:19:56] <sammych> just give it a go
[18:20:06] <thoraxe> i am guessing the issue is I need to figure out a "sane" encoding before POSTing the encrypted data
[18:20:19] <thoraxe> basically the user visits a form, picks a file, I js encrypt it, and then send it into my app, which stores it
[18:20:21] <__joshua___> using "application/octet-stream"?
[18:20:30] <thoraxe> __joshua___: for the post??
[18:20:38] <thoraxe> actually I think it's a "put"
[18:20:46] <__joshua___> post?  for hte mime type on the blob
[18:20:59] <Jattenalle> thoraxe, if it's a put... encode64?
[18:21:08] <__joshua___> put?  i ididn't think you were using a server
[18:21:46] <thoraxe> __joshua___: i was trying to simplify the part i'm workign on now, the server is somewhat irrelevant for that part (once data gets into the browser).  but yes, the server holds the "encrypted" data
[18:22:03] <sammych> it comes from the server encrypted, but he's letting the user download some part of it?
[18:22:34] <sammych> I wish there was some way for an iFrame to break out of it's parent and just 'become' the parent document without a page reload
[18:22:39] <__joshua___> and your problem is the download the binary data is not working right?
[18:23:01] <thoraxe> it "works" just fine for a plain text file
[18:23:09] <thoraxe> it "almost" works for a non-plain text file (ex: gif)
[18:23:14] <sammych> window.top = window...eh eh eh
[18:23:15] <thoraxe> the data looks almost identical, but it's not
[18:23:18] <thoraxe> so something is getting munged
[18:23:42] <sammych> looks like an encoding issue then
[18:24:19] <thoraxe> yes, I need to figure out what to do with the encrypted data before posting it
[18:24:27] <thoraxe> clearly it needs to get converted to some kind of format that is url-happy
[18:24:38] <__joshua___> thoraxe: what is your mime type?
[18:24:42] <__joshua___> on the blob
[18:24:57] <__joshua___> humor me.
[18:25:13] <thoraxe> __joshua___: right now text/html
[18:25:17] <__joshua___> application/octet-stream
[18:25:18] <thoraxe> i could temporarily set it to something else
[18:25:53] <thoraxe> sure lemme try that
[18:26:47] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/7c2e4237d1ba2e24f7e6
[18:28:12] <Jattenalle> sammych, couldnt you, kind of, do that by just replacing the entire parent content with the iframe content?
[18:28:43] <Jattenalle> oh wait, all the URLs would be broken
[18:28:44] <Jattenalle> derp
[18:28:48] <thoraxe> the filesizes are not identical
[18:28:54] <__joshua___> oh sammych, you are just trying to get a text file?
[18:29:21] <__joshua___> decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Latin1)?
[18:30:28] <thoraxe> well, i don't know what the file will actually be
[18:30:31] <thoraxe> might be text, might not
[18:30:44] <thoraxe> lemme add the encryption side
[18:30:58] <__joshua___> well you are decoding as text, right?
[18:31:23] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/7c2e4237d1ba2e24f7e6
[18:31:30] <thoraxe> there's the enc and the dec
[18:31:46] <thoraxe> something is either wrong with what i'm POSTing (encoding, charset, etc) or with how I'm decrypting
[18:32:26] <__joshua___> well you should base64 before you send, and unbase64 on backend (this is easiest route, IMO)
[18:33:28] <thoraxe>  $("#file_contents").val(encrypted.base64()); ??
[18:35:24] <thoraxe> oh looks like i need a jquery base64 plugin?
[18:36:51] <__joshua___> CryptoJS doesn't?
[18:37:12] <__joshua___> CryptoJS.enc.Base64
[18:38:35] <__joshua___> ah, not by default
[18:38:39] <__joshua___> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/1vrovtrr
[18:38:46] <__joshua___> thats the cryptojs plugin
[18:40:46] <thoraxe> i just used a jquery plugin
[18:40:52] <thoraxe> still having issues though
[18:40:54] <thoraxe> well
[18:40:55] <thoraxe> maybe
[18:41:54] <thoraxe> yeah, still not working
[18:42:57] <thoraxe> https://gist.github.com/thoraxe/c79b3911a536b867c8a7 now with base64
[18:54:10] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/CPG8K/  How can I make it so when you click on the form it doesn't slideToggle()
[19:02:17] <__joshua___> http://jsfiddle.net/CPG8K/1/
[19:05:11] <__joshua___> if you are still suck GoGoGarrett: check that link
[19:05:17] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks.
[19:05:28] <__joshua___> or, better yet, put the listener on li a
[19:05:37] <__joshua___> and get rid the second one
[19:06:17] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/CPG8K/2/
[19:06:20] <GoGoGarrett> Thanks for the help :]
[19:08:43] <xniz> Hey all. I have a website where all of my pages are combined into one index. I  use css/jquery to show/hide each div block for the selected page. I am designing the gallery page which uses a mysql db to store image references. How would i go about using.js and jquery to draw the gallery pages."on the fly". . Where would i begin? I dont want to load any gallery.images.until the gallery div is set to visible
[19:09:27] <Jattenalle> xniz, add the <img's dynamically when the gallery is opened
[19:09:32] <Jattenalle> since they dont exist on page-load, they wont load
[19:09:37] <Jattenalle> once you add them, they'll load
[19:09:47] <Jattenalle> simplest solution afaik
[19:10:11] <xniz> Alright. And i should be able to use javascript to access the mysql db?
[19:10:18] <Jattenalle> uhm, no
[19:10:32] <Jattenalle> you'd need to use ajax and talk to a server that hands you the data
[19:10:37] <__joshua___> er depends what you mean
[19:10:37] <xniz> I usually use php but im not sure how to combine php with jquery
[19:10:57] <Jattenalle> just make a serve.php file that does the database stuff and returns a nice list/json of what you need
[19:11:02] <Jattenalle> then just use ajax to grab it
[19:11:09] <__joshua___> yup
[19:11:17] <xniz> Ahh ok. That sounds easy.enough
[19:11:26] <Jattenalle> it's pretty straight forward if you've used php before :)
[19:11:32] <Jattenalle> and jquery makes the ajax bit a piece of cake
[19:11:33] <__joshua___> either get a json response, or, render the response in php and a fragment and append to the dom
[19:11:39] <xniz> Ive never used ajax but ill figure it out
[19:12:33] <xniz> I could easily create the page with just php but i need to have full control
[19:13:11] <Jattenalle> yeah so the php thing only spits out the raw minimum you need, (json is recommended!) but you could just as easily spit out
[19:13:25] <Jattenalle> say.. a | delimited list of image names or whatever it is you need
[19:13:43] <Jattenalle> then you parse it with your JS and do whatever on the client side, full control
[19:15:26] <xniz> Ok. Then when i transition to page 2 of the gallery i can use jquery to "destroy" the img elements from the first set of images?
[19:15:54] <Jattenalle> yup, or just replace them with the new src data
[19:16:12] <Jattenalle> ie, instead of destroying the img and then making a new img
[19:16:17] <Jattenalle> you'd just img.src="new source"
[19:17:49] <xniz> Ahh ok. Cool. Ive used this technique in a game i had created. Okay thank you. I will look into all that asap
[19:36:58] <ledestin> if I want to return error object to $.ajax() call from the server, is it even possible?
[19:37:27] <ledestin> or `error’ callback is only for http errors?
[19:41:46] <__joshua___> $.get().done(func1).fail(func1)
[19:41:51] <__joshua___> or $.ajax
[19:42:57] <ledestin> __joshua___: I asked what do I do on server to get error callback called
[19:43:16] <__joshua___> what server are you using?
[19:43:26] <ledestin> Rails
[19:43:47] <__joshua___> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9130191/how-to-return-correct-http-error-codes-from-ruby-on-rails-application
[19:44:05] <ledestin> __joshua___: haha, thanks
[19:44:29] <__joshua___> any 4xx or 5xx code
[20:06:16] <xp_prg> hi all I am trying to use jquery 1.7.1 in ie 8
[20:06:27] <xp_prg> it says $ is undefined
[20:06:43] <xp_prg> it works fine in chrome etc...
[20:06:51] <xp_prg> any ideas what to do to troubleshoot it?
[20:07:05] <jsharpminor> why aren't you using version 1.11?
[20:07:25] <xp_prg> legacy code etc...
[20:07:41] <xp_prg> any idea what it would say $ is undefined though?
[20:08:09] <jsharpminor> is that what you're getting in the console?
[20:08:17] <xp_prg> ya
[20:09:26] <jsharpminor> have you tried just plugging in the 1.9.2 legacy version and going with that, seeing if that improves or breaks things?
[20:09:40] <xp_prg> no, let me try that
[20:10:11] <jsharpminor> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#jquery-migrate-plugin
[20:12:37] <brm> whats going on people
[20:12:46] <brm> anyone ever styled validation forms?
[20:14:11] <brm> can someone walk me through the process on how to style my jquery validation form
[20:14:19] <brm> im completely new to jquery and ive been trying for 3 days
[20:15:54] <brm> imma pop someone in the mouth if they don't help me right fucking now! im not fucking playing!
[20:16:23] <thoraxe> __joshua___: i think the issue is the buffer i'm using to read in the data, actually
[20:17:59] <brm> need help plox
[20:20:30] <xp_prg> ok, got a weird question, I am in a child frame in ie 8, is it possible to get the jquery from that frame?
[20:23:52] <jsharpminor> xp_prg - I have no idea. Frames themselves are deprecated and being replaced with AJAX and other methods to display changing content.
[21:05:21] <ophi491> -
[21:05:28] <beancurd> yep.
[21:05:58] <ophi491> how do people make global variables without making them global variables
[21:06:50] <systemfault> ophi491: var foo = 10; // local variable
[21:07:22] <systemfault> ophi491: If you want to create a proper global variable, you attach it to the global object, “window"
[21:08:05] <ophi491> Is that bad code design?
[21:08:35] <ophi491> Im trying to not have to use local storage but i dont know how to get values of variables that are out of scope
[21:12:12] <systemfault> ophi491: Depends on the architecture of your application… most apps have at least one global variable where to keep the state.
[21:13:04] <ophi491> I am making a chrome extension. forgive me I am extremely new to JS/Jquery
[21:13:20] <systemfault> Don’t worry, your questions are fine.
[21:13:44] <systemfault> Also, I’m clueless about chrome extensions, I only do “normal” browser JS and Node.js
[21:15:03] <ophi491> well my problem is pretty general I am just not sure the ways to store a persistent variable that you can access in each function
[21:15:08] <ophi491> without using localstorage
[21:15:33] <ophi491> I want to wrap all of my functions in one main function but I am not sure if that is good design
[21:16:13] <systemfault> ophi491: Depends really… you might want to use the “module” pattern.
[21:16:35] <systemfault> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript
[21:17:03] <ophi491> Is that the YUI module pattern thing, I just saw it
[21:17:33] <ophi491> ohh i see
[21:17:42] <systemfault> ophi491: Not exactly, it’s more like a general pattern.
[21:21:47] <ophi491> Thanks
[22:08:24] <sammych> web apps that are 'saved/added to homescreen'
[22:08:42] <sammych> I'll need an android and iOS answer
[22:09:11] <sammych> is the saved app instance totally shutdown when you switch away from it?
[22:09:48] <sammych> simplest example: if you had a input text field page as a saved web app
[22:10:16] <sammych> if you type stuff into it and switch away/back to it, is the entry still there?

[23:41:26] <maxvi> hi everyone! how can I use another jquery version in plugin using jQuery.noConflict()?
[23:45:54] <Cork> maxvi: you can to some degree
[23:46:12] <Cork> maxvi: but if your thinking about embeding jquery inside a plugin; you shouldn't
[23:46:40] <Cork> it is a good way to make using the plugin harder
[23:47:26] <maxvi> Cork: I have some error with jQuery and I have to use jQuery.noConflict and my script works but I get error in a plugin.
[23:47:51] <Cork> maxvi: plugins will bind to the last jquery loaded
[23:47:57] <Cork> or rather
[23:48:05] <Cork> to the jquery loaded latest before they load

[23:49:17] <Cork> maxvi: embedding multiple jquery versions in the same page is harder
