[01:22:45] <subhojit777> Hello, I am using $(selector).resizable() on a div. It is working on browser but not working when I am viewing it on mobile device. I am viewing it on my android device using dolphin browser. Any idea how can to use resizable in mobile devices
[01:24:40] <jphase> subhojit777: try this http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[01:30:19] <subhojit777> jphase, thanks I saw that site on my phone and its resizable demo is working. will try it
[01:30:29] <subhojit777> jphase++

[02:22:55] <krenner> Hello, anyone had similar problem? http://s23.postimg.org/v1wmus7cr/Selection_011.png | chrome, jquery-ui
[02:27:38] <ph88> lol
[02:27:43] <ph88> what's that ? a treasure map ?
[02:30:48] <krenner> ph88: You don't know what's going on?
[02:32:42] <ph88> krenner: is that even valid html to put html elements in button tags ?
[02:34:33] <krenner> ph88: maybe that's point. i have put  <button> <sub></sub>  </button>
[02:34:52] <ph88> ye i know you have
[02:35:04] <ph88> should check if that's valid in html
[02:35:18] <ph88> i guess it is, but better be sure
[02:35:51] <krenner> but you know, the problem is that when i click on the text in button it gaves me this text in event.target
[02:36:36] <krenner> and when i click no on this <sub>2</sub> but on normal text it gaves me <span class="ui-button-text"></span>
[02:37:56] <krenner> those are children objects of my lovely button so maybe i can use some selector to get value from <button> even if event.target points to <sub> or <span> ?
[02:38:03] <ph88> you can try $(event.target).parent('button')
[02:39:59] <mr_c15> hello:)
[02:40:34] <krenner> ph88: okay, it's working on chrome now, but it stopped to work on firefox and ie where event.target always points to <button>
[02:41:37] <mr_c15> Is there function which changes xml tags names to lowercase?
[02:42:24] <krenner> mr_c15: you have string with xml inside and you want to lowercase tag names only?
[02:42:41] <mr_c15> krenner: yes
[02:43:14] <relix> hey guys, promises noob here
[02:43:24] <mr_c15> should I do this by RegEx?
[02:43:28] <relix> is there a way more, erm, best practices way to do this:
[02:43:47] <relix> @retrievePermissions().done -> { @getPublishPermissionDefer.resolve() }
[02:46:13] <ph88> krenner: you can check if the current event.target is a button , if not then try with parent() ... maybe there is a nicer solution, but i dont know it
[03:09:31] <Acrack> hello can somebody tell me what is the proper way to remove an object from an array please ? i trying to do it here : http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/3/
[03:10:58] <shoky> Acrack: users.splice(1, 1)
[03:11:28] <Acrack> but what if i have 89 users
[03:11:34] <Acrack> knowing that i have the id to delete
[03:11:53] <shoky> then you'll need to look for that id
[03:12:16] <Acrack> this is what im trying to find out
[03:12:16] <Acrack> ^^
[03:12:26] <ph88> Acrack:  Array.indexOf
[03:13:30] <ph88> actually i would prefere a map() function for that myself ^^
[03:13:38] <Acrack> what map does ?
[03:13:47] <Acrack> stupid exemples http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_indexof.asp
[03:13:48] <ph88> read doc http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map/
[03:14:59] <ph88> eh sorry filter()
[03:16:16] <shoky> you could just build a hashmap out of that users array with ids as keys, will probably be useful for other stuff
[03:16:53] <shoky> var usersMap = {}; $.each(users, function(i, user) { usersMap[user.id] = user })
[03:18:12] <ph88> confused with underscore :|
[03:18:27] <Acrack> im a little bit confused :D
[03:18:39] <Acrack> im trying to use that indexOf thingy first
[03:22:55] <ph88> Acrack: http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/4/
[03:23:51] <Acrack> i must use normal javascript ph88
[03:24:13] <ph88> Acrack: this is normal javascript  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[03:24:53] <ph88> here without jQuery still runs http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/5/
[03:25:09] <ph88> and by the way ... ##javascript ...
[03:25:13] <Acrack> but you aren't deleting here you are filtering no ?
[03:25:25] <ph88> look at the console.log
[03:25:26] <Acrack> i don't know but i can't write on that channel
[03:25:28] <ph88> they are not the same
[03:25:33] <ph88> one is for users other for user
[03:25:49] <Acrack> but i want the array users
[03:25:57] <ph88> Acrack: you must register yourself with freenode, go to #freenode for help
[03:26:19] <Acrack> thanks i ll
[03:26:37] <ph88> Acrack: ..... easy http://jsfiddle.net/mKVLW/6/
[03:26:41] <Acrack> your filter function is giving me an array of selected ids right ?
[03:26:58] <ph88> just overwrite users instead of putting it in a new variable
[03:27:28] <ph88> Acrack: why not run the console, check your console and see what it gives ?
[03:27:51] <Acrack> i did ph88 but its my fault i made a mistake when asking the question
[03:27:58] <Acrack> i meant how to delete id = 1
[03:28:35] <ph88> change     === 5    to    !== 1
[03:28:50] <ph88> this is basic programming logic ...
[03:28:56] <ph88> maybe you need some more practise ?!
[03:29:11] <Acrack> thanks mate :D
[03:29:14] <ph88> np
[03:29:34] <Acrack> yea i need some more practice ^^
[03:30:13] <Acrack> just to know is filter good for the performances ?
[03:30:26] <Acrack> when you have a big array
[03:30:32] <ph88> i don't know
[03:31:00] <Acrack> okey
[03:31:04] <Acrack> thanks a lot mate

[05:43:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hey, i got a jquery object containing a "select" - and a string containing the options
[05:43:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how to put the options inside the select in 1 wrap command?
[06:03:25] <aleray> hi, I'm looking for a simalar plugin as http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/ working without bootstrap
[06:03:43] <aleray> i'm interested by the "multiple"

[07:07:07] <fairuz> Hi guys. I use jQuery's autocomplete. I've put 0 to minLength option but I still need to enter at least one character before the search is done. Is this normal? I expect that it will search as soon as it has focus.
[07:08:07] <Velveeta> you could try adding a focus handler to it that triggers keypress maybe ?
[07:08:44] <morris4> hi. can anybody give me insight on this one? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19236382/jquery-custom-event-via-object-not-triggered
[07:09:47] <fairuz> Velveeta: WIll try that . ty
[07:15:21] <Velveeta> morris4: i'm digging into this to see why it's doing that, btw
[07:15:29] <Velveeta> it'll take at least a few minutes though
[07:15:43] <morris4> of course, no problem, thank you!
[07:41:39] <kpl> With jQ 1.9 I should replace $.ajax({success:   with   $.ajax({done:   ?
[07:42:16] <Velveeta> kpl: you would keep the success parameter in place, done is used if you're chaining off the returned promise object, like $.ajax({options}).done(function(){});
[07:42:28] <Velveeta> morris4: i'm still digging through your issue
[07:51:42] <kpl> Velveeta: Will .done(fn) replace the setting success: fn  ?
[07:51:50] <Velveeta> kpl: yepyep
[07:55:12] <kpl> I read something about the success and error settings being deprecated, but I can still use them (for how long?) So the promise methods  .done() and  .fail()  can now be used instead of settings success and error?
[07:56:07] <kpl> Ah, it was jqXHR.success() and so on which are deprecated. Not the settings with the same names?
[07:57:05] <Velveeta> yeah that sounds right (on both counts)
[07:57:57] <Erneston> hello
[08:03:04] <Velveeta> oh god i'm stupid, i just spent the last 20 minutes chasing this thing for no reason :D
[08:03:08] <Velveeta> morris4: you still here?
[08:03:58] <Erneston> anyone here experienced with parallex scrolling?>
[08:04:34] <Velveeta> i'm familiar w/ the concept, enver done it myself
[08:05:17] <Erneston> what am trying to do is
[08:05:26] <Erneston> play a image animation when the user scrolls
[08:05:37] <Erneston> i have realised a .gif is not a good solution
[08:23:11] <kama> hi all:)
[08:23:17] <kama> kama is comming:)
[08:23:23] <kama> plz welcome
[08:23:34] <Velveeta> kama chameleon?
[08:24:02] * kama double in size and swallow Velveeta :(
[08:24:29] <Velveeta> i'm completely lost here
[08:25:10] <kama> Velveeta: how long have you been using jquery?
[08:25:24] <Velveeta> at least a couple weeks now
[08:26:23] <kama> Velveeta: newbie
[08:26:35] <Velveeta> thanks?
[08:27:10] <ph88> lol
[08:27:37] <kama> how to become a good jquery programmer:)
[08:28:40] <Velveeta> is that your question? do you have a question?
[08:29:45] <kama> Velveeta: dude, i have use extjs about 5 years ago, and haven't been using it for nearly 5 years
[08:29:59] <kama> Velveeta: forget all about ext staff now:(
[08:30:23] <Velveeta> ok, well, this is the wrong channel to be asking about ext anywayâ€¦ do you have a jquery question?
[08:30:49] <kama> Velveeta: now i am about to pick up with jquery
[08:30:56] <kama> Velveeta: dude , how old are you?
[08:31:09] <Velveeta> does it matter how old i am?
[08:31:31] <Velveeta> if you want to become a good jquery developer, start by reading through the API documentation and taking on some smallish projects to put it to use
[08:31:39] <Velveeta> same as i would advise for any given library/framework
[08:32:50] <kama> Velveeta: what is the relationg betwee js and css?
[08:33:07] <Velveeta> kama: are you asking that question in general, or with regards to jquery?
[08:33:19] <kama> Velveeta: seems Js can handle CSS and HTML in the calculated way
[08:34:10] <kama> Velveeta: this general question will soon converge to Jquery:)
[08:35:10] <Velveeta> css is to style your document, js is to add behavior to itâ€¦ yes, you can augment page styles using javascript, but whenever possible, it should always be done via css rulesâ€¦ you can use javascript to add/remove classes to better target predefined css rules with specificity, but you should avoid applying styles directly with javascript
[08:35:28] <ph88> how can you have been doing extJS and not know this ...
[08:37:06] <Velveeta> i was wondering the same thing
[08:37:18] <Velveeta> it's not like css is some new revelation, it's been around for over a decade now...
[08:37:34] <Velveeta> about 2 of them really
[08:38:00] <kama> ph88: since when you are using extjs, you don't need to know the existence of css, all the css related issue is encapsulated by extjs, you just setup some properties to extjs objects, in fact, this properties which is assigned to extjs objects are used to generate dynamic css by that JS framework
[08:38:50] <kama> Velveeta: in fact lots of the details are hided by the JS Frameworks
[08:39:46] <Velveeta> kama: right, that's the purpose of libraries and frameworks, to abstract away some functionalityâ€¦ but it's still advised to do your presentation strictly in css, and use js to target it with specificity rather than directly modifying styles at the element level
[08:40:23] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure extjs doesn't "generate dynamic css" but rather modify the element styles directly
[08:40:47] <Erneston> is jquery required in order to make css animation change sprite background-position on scroll?
[08:41:03] <kama> Velveeta: yep, but it's better to know such details , though we don't need to use such kind of knowledge in ordinary js development
[08:41:40] <kama> Velveeta: if you know the details you may feel like that everything is under control:)
[08:41:45] <Velveeta> kama: most js developers have at least a rudimentary knowledge of standard web details like html and cssâ€¦ i don't think i've ever met *strictly* a js developer
[08:41:59] <kama> Velveeta: in fact you can even write your own JS Framework
[08:42:35] <Velveeta> kama: i'm having a hard time following your englishâ€¦ is there a specific question you're here to ask?
[08:42:51] <kama> Velveeta: yes, they know some, but not enough to be an expert
[08:43:29] <Velveeta> erneston: i wouldn't say it's required, have you done your own research on typical parallax implementations?
[08:43:34] <kama> Velveeta: oops, how long have you been using english
[08:43:49] <Velveeta> kama: my entire lifeâ€¦â€¦ how long have you been using it?
[08:43:56] <Erneston> ive been searching parallex yes
[08:44:14] <Erneston> i am a little overwhelmed with the variations of plugin use and jquery versions
[08:44:19] <kama> Velveeta: oops, 10+ years
[08:44:43] <Erneston> which plugin to you recommend for parallex scrolling?
[08:46:00] <Velveeta> i don't have a plugin recommendation for parallax scrolling, i don't use it
[08:46:42] <kama> Velveeta: have you read the source of JQuery?
[08:46:49] <Velveeta> several times, yes
[08:47:00] <kama> Velveeta: or you just use it, without knowing its underlying mechanism?
[08:50:11] <kama> Velveeta: wow, how can you finish this in weeks?
[08:50:22] <Erneston> anyone?
[08:50:28] <Velveeta> i didn't say i had only been using jquery for weeks.. i said *at least* a couple of weeks
[08:50:28] <kama> Velveeta: you said you just start to use jquery in couple of weeks:(
[08:50:51] <Velveeta> i've been using this for years
[08:51:21] <kama> Velveeta: then you are liar:( you should say that you have been using it for years:)
[08:51:37] <Velveeta> i'm not a liar at all, you failed to understand my english ;)
[08:51:50] <anthonym> âœ“
[08:51:50] <anthonym> Velveeta :
[08:53:13] <Velveeta> kama: so you still haven't gotten to your actual question yet
[08:55:19] <kama> Velveeta: lol, i could say i have been use xx for 365/24=15.2 days:)
[08:55:35] <kama> Velveeta: in fact i have been using xx for one year, one hour per day:(
[08:56:06] <kama> Velveeta: you are still somewhat a liar:)
[08:56:09] <Velveeta> Syntax Error: Please rephrase your statement in the form of a question.
[08:58:52] <kama> Velveeta: so you are focused on front end development, right?
[08:59:24] <Velveeta> yes
[09:00:33] <kama> Velveeta: staying focused is nice, my interests is so wide that i know lots of technologies, but not good at one:(
[09:00:48] <Velveeta> we call that a jack of all trades, master of none
[09:00:50] <kpl> In jQuery.ajax( url [, settings ] ), what is the difference between the url parameter and the "url" setting? Isn't the url parameter mandatory?
[09:01:38] <kama> Velveeta: this could be my weak point:(
[09:02:07] <kama> Velveeta: but if i can be expert on a couple of them, then that will be my strength:)
[09:02:08] <Velveeta> kpl: $.ajax will accept multiple formats at runtime, you can pass the url as a string for the first parameter, with your settings object as the 2nd, or you can pass just a settings object which includes a url property w/ the url stringâ€¦ either is valid
[09:02:29] <kpl> I see, thanks.
[09:04:40] <kama> Velveeta: which editor do you use when programming jquery?
[09:05:42] <Velveeta> primarily, i use sublime, but it depends on what project i'm working on at work, some of our projects have .NET running on the back end, so i use visual studio as an IDEâ€¦ the ones that don't use .NET, i use sublime
[09:06:41] <kama> Velveeta: lol, i have switched to sublime this week:) seem this is a right choice
[09:06:52] <Velveeta> yeah, it's a pretty great editor
[09:07:22] <kama> Velveeta: which version of sublime do you use now? mine is 2.0.2
[09:07:39] <Velveeta> same
[09:08:26] <kama> Velveeta: https://github.com/jquery is this jquery's official code repository?
[09:10:03] <kpl> jQuery.get  and  jQuery.post:   the latter needs to be used when the combination of url and data params contain a lot of information? No difference in the way, or capacity of, data returned?
[09:10:28] <Velveeta> kama: i'm not sure if that's the "official" one, but i would guess yes
[09:11:35] <Velveeta> kpl: in general, post is considered more secure than get, because it doesn't *easily* allow for editing of the data being passed to the serverâ€¦ additionally, yes, it supports larger data payloads, because in some browsers, your get parameters will be limited by the max allowable url length
[09:13:51] <kpl> So the diffs are only with regard to the transfer to the server, not the response?
[09:14:26] <Velveeta> right, the server can respond identically to either a get or post request
[09:14:28] <kilian123> kpl: yes
[09:14:44] <Velveeta> that's its own end of the transaction, which is separate from how you're requesting your data
[09:15:27] <jop008> how to share code among pages which is part of document.ready part?
[09:16:30] <jop008> I don't want to duplicate the same code aross multiple pages
[09:16:53] <kilian123> "which is part of document.ready part"?
[09:17:10] <kilian123> include an extern file using jquery?
[09:17:10] <jop008> yes functions that is within document.ready
[09:17:13] <Velveeta> jop008: you'll have to, if they're truly separate pagesâ€¦ if they're just dynamically injected content, like with a single-page app, you can probably get away with manually firing that function after each request completes
[09:17:44] <Velveeta> jop008: yeah, what killian says, unless you're counting that as duplicating your code
[09:18:12] <jop008> yes maintenance is not that handy
[09:18:21] <kama> Velveeta: dude, which branch of jquery do you use now? http://img.itc.cn/photo/oYiIit3Lgif
[09:18:43] <jop008> I have some json calls of some data elements which is part of separate pages
[09:20:02] <Velveeta> kama: if you're looking to download it, you should go through jquery.comâ€¦ we're on 1.9.2 i believe
[09:20:23] <kilian123> you want to use external json data that is included in another page? jop008
[09:20:27] <Velveeta> ok, i'm out for a few hours, time to go run errands, good luck everyone
[09:20:30] <kama> Velveeta: so you don't download jquery from github:(
[09:20:41] <Velveeta> kama: i don't, no.. i download it from jquery.com
[09:21:03] <kama> veebers: wow, finish your mission, then come back:)
[09:21:17] <jop008> yes 3 fields with a select
[09:21:27] <jop008> the select items comes from the DB
[09:21:32] <jop008> =database
[09:22:05] <jop008> I want the json stuff shared if possible
[09:22:16] <kilian123> fetch the whole code and extract it...?
[09:22:18] <kilian123> jop008:
[09:22:34] <kama> jop008: have you read the source of jquery
[09:22:45] <jop008> No
[09:23:02] <kilian123> sorry, i didnt get it yet... jop008
[09:23:04] <kama> jop008: then you should set veebers as your model:)
[09:23:55] <sahilsk> Hi, i'm trying to pass my array to  jquery animate callback function. But inside this callback function i get its value "undefined". I know it's all closure trick but anyone has any idea how to acess my array without declaring it global?
[09:24:14] <sahilsk> and yes, inside animate callback function.
[09:24:14] <sahilsk> ??
[09:24:52] <kilian123> animate...(function(a) {})? sahilsk
[09:25:35] <kama> jop008: do you want to study the source of jquery:)
[09:25:46] <jop008> no time for that
[09:25:58] <sahilsk> kilian123: yaa but "a" is come out to be "undefined"
[09:26:01] <jop008> but I noticed the code is slightly different
[09:26:05] <kama> jop008: are you a full time front end developer?
[09:29:12] <Netbulae> on *:LOAD:{
[09:29:12] <Netbulae>   set %RainbowTextOn 0
[09:29:13] <Netbulae>   set %RainTxtStatus Enable
[09:29:13] <Netbulae>   set %RainTxtColK Background
[09:29:13] <Netbulae>   set %RainTxtColH 0
[09:29:38] <jop008> yes full time now
[09:30:30] <sahilsk> anyone?? passing data inside animate callback function?
[09:30:52] <kilian123> sahilsk: du you use "animate()" or a similar function?
[09:32:05] <sahilsk> kilian123: i used .animate method. there is callback inside and i know it. Thing is how to access my outer variables inside this callback funtion. ?
[09:32:25] <kama> oops, seems github supports subversion now
[09:32:29] <kama> what a pity
[09:33:04] <jphase> sahilsk: define them before your .animate call
[09:37:37] <kilian123> how can i select a data- attribute?
[09:38:01] <jphase> kilian123: .data
[09:39:31] <sahilsk> kilian123: found it. I used data.
[09:40:05] <sahilsk> jphase: i used data function and stored my outer variables in key/value
[09:40:49] <kama> how to build jquery from source?
[09:40:52] <jphase> sure, you can do that as well
[09:43:05] <jphase> kama: you don't really "build" jQuery from source like c app, it's just not minified
[09:43:32] <jphase> kama: use the file that doesn't have .min.js in it
[09:49:07] <ryentzer> I'm having trouble using a variable within a selector and could use some help.
[09:49:29] <ryentzer> I've setup a simple test at jsbin. Here is the link. http://jsbin.com/ofEjavO/2/edit
[09:50:03] <ryentzer> I'm trying to select a child of an element assigned to a variable.
[09:50:14] <kilian123> i have a responsive layout and want some divs do be hidden on small screens. but it shoukd work without javascript too
[09:50:23] <kilian123> so the boxes have to be visible on start
[09:50:53] <kilian123> and only if the screen is small AND those boxes have a data-attribute "data-hidden-small" it should be hidden
[09:51:13] <kilian123> but how do i select those data attributes the save way?
[09:51:16] <jphase> ryentzer: you need to use t as a string not an object
[09:52:03] <ryentzer> jphase like so? $('t h2')
[09:52:13] <jphase> ryentzer: console.log($(t + ' h2'));
[09:52:21] <jphase> ryentzer: where var t = '.test';
[09:52:24] <jphase> without the $()
[09:52:50] <jphase> alternatively you could use .children or .find with the method you're using but I find this way easier
[09:53:30] <ryentzer> ahhhh, now I see
[09:54:08] <ryentzer> Thank you
[09:54:11] <jphase> np
[09:55:01] <kama> jphase: in fact you should build jquery, using two damed tools named grunt-cli and bower:(
[09:56:58] <Velveeta> kama: in fact you don't have to build jquery, what jphase said was correctâ€¦ there should be both a minified and a non-minified version provided
[09:57:16] <Velveeta> typically, you use the non-minified version during development, and the minified version in production environments
[09:57:49] <kama> Velveeta: lol, so you have finised your mission and come back:)
[09:58:05] <Velveeta> nope, i was in the shower, tying my shoes now, and about to head out the door
[09:59:43] <kama> Velveeta: oops, do you use gtalk, hope i can add you there:)
[10:00:59] <Velveeta> i do, but i don't give it out to strangers online, my daddy told me they'd want to touch me in my special place if i did
[10:01:25] <Velveeta> but i'm in this channel fairly regularly
[10:01:29] <jphase> lulz
[10:01:32] <kama> Velveeta: i am not F xxB...I :(
[10:01:36] <kama> Velveeta: easy:)
[10:01:49] <Velveeta> and you can always follow me on twitter at this same name
[10:02:06] <jphase> Velveeta: does give out (her? his?) cheesiness to just anyone
[10:02:14] <Velveeta> his
[10:02:17] <kama> Velveeta: seems seldom disscuss technology on twitter:(
[10:02:26] <jphase> I try not to assume :x
[10:02:38] <Velveeta> well i respond when other people want to discuss it
[10:02:47] <Velveeta> jphase: good on ya ;)
[10:03:49] <Velveeta> kama: i have a blog you can follow as well, if you likeâ€¦ my only commenters so far have been coworkers, so i'd welcome the traffic ;)
[10:03:59] <Velveeta> conqueringtheclient.com
[10:04:04] <kama> Velveeta: lol, nice:)
[10:04:16] <kama> Velveeta: in fact i have about 200 + blogs:)
[10:04:52] <kama> but it's used for log issues:(
[10:05:25] <kama> better i can start a blog to write blogs not logs:)
[10:05:44] <Velveeta> good luck w/ that :) in the meantime, i'm about to head out the door now
[10:06:13] <jphase> Velveeta: haha some funny stuff on here
[10:06:34] <kama> Velveeta: wow, hope you can finish your mission and come back happily:)
[10:17:26] <Erneston> is parallex.js the recommended plugin ?
[10:20:56] <jphase> Erneston: parallax.js is widely used, there are several out there though.
[10:25:21] <kama> jphase: do you use twitter?
[10:25:43] <jphase> I use their API, but that's it
[10:25:58] <kama> jphase: do you have a twitter account?
[10:26:16] <jphase> probably?
[10:26:18] <jphase> idk
[10:27:12] <kama> jphase: idk? your nick on twitter?
[10:27:39] <jphase> kama: no idk = i don't know. I literally don't use twitter besides integrating with their API for clients
[10:27:42] <kama> jphase: seems i have find Velveeta, his twitter page is likely https://twitter.com/Velveeta
[10:28:16] <jphase> kama: you're creepy
[10:28:17] <jphase> :P
[10:31:22] <dev11> is this working on all browsers? $('input:focus')
[10:33:17] <Erneston> jphase whats my issue
[10:33:21] <Erneston> am trying to decide which one to use
[10:33:27] <Erneston> what is recommended?
[10:33:47] <jphase> Erneston: just use parallax.js
[10:36:55] <Erneston> thx
[10:41:06] <kama> it's 1:41 am here
[10:41:08] <kama> tired
[10:41:40] <dev11> how to sue $('input:focus') to check if element has focus
[10:42:40] <jphase> dev11: if($('input:focus').length > 0)
[10:50:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to make a select box width fixed even if there are text option longer than the specified width of the select?
[10:51:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: specify the width?
[10:52:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i'm asking you, not myself
[10:52:48] <dev11> how to check if input element has focus?
[10:53:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: im telling you not asking you the question mark is for ......nvm......specify the width in css
[10:53:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/selectwidth.htm
[10:54:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok tx
[10:58:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> ecky--ptang-zoob: np...sry the question mark was like a "thats obvious" sort of thing
[10:58:15] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I know ;)
[10:58:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:58:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx, it works
[10:58:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[10:58:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> you might want to use attribute for older browsers
[10:58:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I thought it would cut the texts short
[10:58:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope
[10:58:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> but as i was say
[10:58:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> *saying
[10:58:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> attr for older browsers
[10:59:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> but most support width since all have css1 except for the likes of netscape and all
[10:59:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> width='' ?
[11:10:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[11:10:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> as an attribute in the <select> html
[11:10:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> but use css
[11:10:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> its better and faster
[11:30:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What's wrong with this? $("<option />").attr("value", area["id"]).prop("selected", true).text("test"); - what's wrong with this? It won't select the option
[11:31:08] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: .attr('selected', 'selected')
[11:31:57] <ecky--ptang-zoob> problem is I must set the attribute
[11:32:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's a loop
[11:32:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so what do I set the attr for in case not selected?
[11:32:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> attr("selected", ???)
[11:32:37] <jphase> .attr({value: area['id']});
[11:32:48] <jphase> .attr({value: area['id'], selected: 'selected'});    for selected
[11:33:15] <atpa8a> hello folkes
[11:33:17] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: if you need to remove an already selected attribute, use .removeAttr('selected');
[11:33:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why can't I do it with prop?
[11:34:06] <atpa8a> what can i use to have my page go to an #anchor when i click a button?
[11:34:13] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: you can, but .attr is meant for strings
[11:34:30] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: should work fine with prop
[11:34:55] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: .prop('selected', 'selected')   not   .prop('selected', true)
[11:35:13] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no I think prop works with a boolean
[11:35:26] <jphase> okay, then I see nothing wrong with your code hten
[11:35:28] <jphase> then*
[11:35:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> me neither
[11:35:54] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: how about try without the boolean, if that works, then that must be the problem
[11:36:37] * jphase doesn't really know why he uses .attr('selected', 'selected') for that but maybe it's from a similar problem?
[11:36:46] <jphase> I hate how over time you forget why you do what you do :[
[11:36:55] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hehe
[11:36:56] <grafi> comments!
[11:37:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well jquery has so many backup syntaxes for the same command
[11:37:50] <jphase> grafi: I meant more in terms of why I use a certain syntax. But yeah, I comment everything for sure ;)
[11:38:27] <grafi> then you dont forget :P
[11:39:28] <jphase> hmm, I don't really have the liberty of being like "hmm.. what was the first project I used this method on?" and then greping to look at my comment to figure out why I use a particular method
[11:39:51] <jphase> but I suppose if it was really bothering me to find out, I would, or I'd probably just try both options in fiddle :\
[11:59:37] <Ricaz> If I have a .click() event on a <tr>, and a .click() event on a button inside that <tr>, can I somehow prevent the <tr>'s .click() and only do the button's .click()?
[12:03:44] <shoshy> hey, quick question , sorry for not having a jsfiddle. But i'll try my luck anyway: I'm using jquery ui , with draggble & droppable. The draggable uses a helper function which clones the element (it's a LI element) and adds it to the UL, and returns it. The dropppable has a drop event, that should add some css 3 class (animation) when its dropped. If i DON'T use a helper (if by helper:
[12:03:44] <shoshy> function(){...} or helper: 'clone' that is), it works, else it doesn't. after digging in it , if i debug and step line-by-line i can see the animation kicks in (the animation should take 5s). But without debugging, it doesnt. Any clues?
[12:10:20] <JLT> I have a simple little jquery script that's supposed to fade a background into the next and it basically works through an array of colors. http://jsfiddle.net/9W9C5/ for some reason, despite the function being called over and over again, the background isn't changing color?!
[12:10:26] <JLT> Has to be a simple typo but I see nothign
[12:12:26] <JLT> putting console.log(colors[i]); will show that the colors are alternating and that the process is working.. it just won't change the color of .loader
[12:15:34] <Richhh> how can i convert !"£$%^&*() inputs in an input box into 1234567890 (basically ignore shift)
[12:15:40] <Richhh> so that users can quickly shift tab between inputs and put numbers in
[12:16:30] <Richhh> i have this but what do to with it ---- intercept = { '!':1, '"':2, '£':3, '$':4, '%':5, '^':6, '&':7, '*':8, '(':9, ')':0 };
[12:16:38] <dev11> how to check if input element has focus?
[12:17:00] <JLT> .has(":focus") perhaps?
[12:17:03] <shoshy> found the solution to my problem..
[12:18:29] <unnu> damn #php is invite only  :(
[12:18:47] <Richhh> JLT whats the difference between has and is
[12:18:51] <Richhh> in jQuery
[12:20:40] <JLT> Erm.. I'm not too sure. When selecting elements, I think .has refers to children... but not sure about selectors.
[12:21:06] <Kaylors> http://jsfiddle.net/eqY2z/2/
[12:21:18] <Kaylors> I don't understand why the focusout isn't working...
[12:22:00] <dev11> if ( $('#id').is(':focus' ))
[12:22:05] <dev11> this will work?
[12:23:06] <Kaylors> http://jsfiddle.net/eqY2z/2/
[12:23:07] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone a good idea to make a select box flash for 200ms, to draw attention to it?
[12:23:08] <Kaylors> I don't understand why the focusout isn't working...
[12:24:28] <Thoams_> ecky--ptang-zoob: css animations
[12:24:34] <Thoams_> also, make your nick easier to type
[12:24:35] <Thoams_> :@
[12:25:13] <Kaylors> No one? :\
[12:25:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> focusout = blur
[12:25:34] <unnu> Kaylors im working on it
[12:25:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $("#id").on("blur", function() {} );
[12:25:47] <Kaylors> unnu: Thanks :) -waits-
[12:26:30] <Kaylors> ecky--ptang-zoob: Just tried it...doesn't make a difference :(
[12:26:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can I see the code?
[12:27:14] <Kaylors> http://jsfiddle.net/eqY2z/2/
[12:28:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what do you want to achieve?
[12:28:18] <JLT> Kaylors your problem is that divs by default cannot be focused. I added the attribute tabindex which means you can now focus on the div. By default, I've given it focus when it's shown. http://jsfiddle.net/eqY2z/5/
[12:28:48] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/eqY2z/6/ is this what you want it to do kaylors?
[12:29:17] <unnu> lol, im confused at what your trying to achieve
[12:29:38] <Kaylors> unnu: Yup. In fact, currently I'm using that exact solution, but dont want my users losing the thing coz of accidental mouse movement.
[12:29:50] <JLT> Kaylors look at my solution please. :)
[12:30:03] <Kaylors> JLT: Thanks, I see now :) So I guess if I had used an image tag it would have worked?
[12:30:29] <JLT> Kaylors maybe not sure.. I don't know what elements by default can have focus.. I know form fields can certainly.
[12:31:01] <Kaylors> JLT: Thanks anyway. You helped clear that confusion and gave me a solution. Have a good day ^.^
[12:31:10] <Kaylors> unnu: You, too, have a good day.

[13:02:11] <Playied> Hey
[13:02:46] <Playied> How do I connect to #PHP?
[13:02:55] <Playied> It's not allowing me to /j #php since it's invite only. :/
[13:03:01] <nafta> You need to register
[13:06:08] <nafta> Hello, I have the following issue: I need to create a complex form that grabs data from a mysql db to populate some selects and to perform some calculations in order to fill other fields of the form because other selects depend on this values. What is the best way to approach this? Thanks a lot.
[13:07:13] <kilian123> prepare with php and mysql and update via ajax
[13:07:15] <nafta> I am looking for a way on doing this without refreshing the site (the old refresh sort of form)
[13:07:28] <Thoams_> ajax it up the yingyang
[13:08:05] <nafta> but what should I doâ€¦.everytime a user fills one of the fieldsâ€¦I have to send that field to the PHP script..right?
[13:08:31] <kilian123> no. on change = check value. if value = ??? -> then request new data
[13:08:37] <nafta> or should I make the calculations on the file that has the form?
[13:08:43] <kilian123> but you should check the data on server side
[13:08:52] <kilian123> yes, client side
[13:09:22] <kilian123> you could also load all the form fields and just make those visible that you need
[13:09:34] <kilian123> and change visibility depending on the selected fields
[13:09:46] <nafta> do you guys know a good place where I could find a developer to do this?
[13:09:55] <kilian123> <-- :)
[13:12:32] <kilian123> nafta: you will need an API on server side
[13:13:22] <kilian123> if you want to update the fields "on the fly"
[13:13:28] <kilian123> using mysql data
[13:14:06] <kilian123> anybody want to give me some layout feedback for a page?
[13:16:28] <kilian123> does anybody want to test a responsive layout?
[13:18:21] <nafta> yes
[13:18:23] <nafta> shoot
[13:18:39] <nafta> kilian123: what do you mean by an API?
[13:18:44] <kilian123> http://www.vegpool.de/wegweiser/index.html?style=responsive
[13:18:45] <nafta> I mean..what API?
[13:18:49] <kilian123> its responsive
[13:18:53] <nafta> one made by myself?
[13:19:00] <kilian123> your jquery will need an API to fetch the new data
[13:19:51] <nafta> it is working nice
[13:20:03] <kilian123> what device?
[13:20:15] <nafta> but I would add a little bit more space between some divs
[13:20:19] <nafta> to give it some air
[13:20:30] <adamsilver> http://bpaste.net/show/uy7eM00tLN55CAJEr8EW/ :: why ".removeClass('hidden')" is only working when the page is first loaded. If I navigate to another page and hit the back button the 'hidden' class of my div (<div id="authentication" class="hidden">) is applied from the css side but not removed using the js code
[13:21:17] <kilian123> adamsilver: some browsers cache the content
[13:21:31] <kilian123> nafta: which divs need more space?
[13:21:37] <adamsilver> kilian123: what would be the solution?
[13:21:46] <kilian123> and what kind of device do you use? which screen size?
[13:21:55] <kilian123> hmm. not sure, adamsilver
[13:21:56] <nafta> iphone 5
[13:22:06] <nafta> and macbook pro
[13:22:37] <nafta> looks great as well on a galaxy note 1 a 2 and a 3
[13:22:42] <Whoomper_> I'm a newb when it comes to services and ajax calls.

[13:23:02] <kilian123> nafta: wow cool ;)
[13:23:07] <kilian123> which divs need more space?
[13:23:11] <Thoams_> since the apple mac, apple have remained resolute that their users want closed box experiences
[13:23:24] <kilian123> and which page-size?
[13:23:45] <Thoams_> everything is sold as-is, you can't change it... it felt wrong
[13:23:50] <Thoams_> so did objective c
[13:23:59] <Thoams_> our platform, our language

[13:25:16] <kilian123> Whoomper_: .getJSON
[13:26:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What is wrong with this? $(this + " option:selected").text()
[13:27:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it says unrecognized expressions
[13:27:15] <nafta> kilian123: which API you recommend?
[13:27:19] <kilian123> $(this).find("option")
[13:27:35] <kilian123> nafta: Ã¤hm... you probobly need to create some
[13:27:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> aah
[13:27:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tx
[13:28:28] <Kruptein> kilian123, hm ok so I know how to get the clicked div but on second thought I want to know if its the third or fourth div within the section, is that possible?
[13:29:14] <kilian123> Kruptein: give it some data-number="1"-attribute
[13:29:30] <kilian123> then $(this).data() or similar
[13:29:49] <Whoomper_> kilian123: excellent. Thanks. (working now: http://jsfiddle.net/DPCmw/3/)
[13:29:51] <kilian123> there is the number that you gave the divs before (should be unique)
[13:31:14] <nafta> kilian123: jesusâ€¦.isn't there a nicer way to do this?
[13:31:16] <nafta> hehe
[13:31:21] <Kruptein> ok thanks I think I can manage it now
[13:31:42] <kilian123> nafta: it depends on how many fields you need
[13:32:13] <nafta> seems very easy to do with the old refresh page wayâ€¦but I don't want the user to see the page refreshing every time a field gets filled
[13:32:34] <kilian123> no nafta, no whole page refresh
[13:32:51] <kilian123> just a request to the server...
[13:33:03] <kilian123> the server gives you a json that you use for new fields
[13:33:14] <kilian123> but you have to create that funcionality on server side
[13:34:23] <nafta> I have to make a script that returns the json based on what I throw at it
[13:34:32] <kilian123> jep
[13:34:55] <nafta> and then use that json data to make calculations and make other request
[13:34:58] <kilian123> like <?php if($_GET['field'] = "name") echo "surname";?>
[13:35:17] <nafta> yeah
[13:35:21] <kilian123> then add a new field to the form, depending on the server data
[13:35:54] <nafta> I understandâ€¦so php,json and ajax is the way to go
[13:36:07] <kilian123> probably
[13:36:25] <kilian123> but think of people with no javascript
[13:36:43] <kilian123> you could also use xml and Java :)
[13:37:04] <kilian123> JPS
[13:37:06] <kilian123> JSP
[13:37:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> WTF? http://jsfiddle.net/jDvxP/
[13:37:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why does it not output "string" only??
[13:39:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> makes no sense, jsfiddle
[13:39:41] <jphase> ecky--ptang-zoob: it does, add jQuery library on top left of fiddle
[13:39:48] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/jDvxP/2/
[13:40:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it still logs crap string
[13:40:31] <jphase> hmm, not for me
[13:40:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/jDvxP/2/
[13:40:41] <jphase> you click my link?
[13:40:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> shows "crap string" in the result
[13:41:10] <jphase> that's not the console though
[13:41:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so how do I display something in that thing?
[13:41:25] <jphase> crap string is the markup result
[13:41:45] <jphase> ctrl + shift + j    or something on windows?   cmd + shift + j on mac
[13:41:52] <jphase> that's the console, which says "string" like you expected
[13:42:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[13:42:02] <jphase> the window on the right is your rendered markup
[13:42:09] <jphase> just looks like console with only text ;)
[13:42:34] <kilian123> hehe
[13:46:37] <jphase> ugh... someone shoot me now, last words before delving into MODx export script :`[
[13:53:37] <Kruptein> ok kilian123 sorry if Im botering you, Im doing something wrong http://dpaste.com/1414487/
[13:53:42] <Kruptein> *bothering
[14:06:25] <jphase> Kruptein: you could use $(this).data('number')     or if if you just need the index you could try $(this).index()
[14:08:37] <Kruptein> jphase, well I managed to get it, problem was that wherever I clicked I got a child of the parent div which I assigned the data-number to
[14:09:28] <Kruptein> jphase, Im now using this http://dpaste.com/1414489/
[14:09:31] <Kruptein> is that overkill?
[14:11:38] <jphase> Kruptein: nah, not if it works to do what you need
[14:11:52] <Kruptein> jphase, ok nice thanks for your time
[14:15:22] <unnu> SUP JPHASE
[14:16:04] <jphase> hey unnu, how goes it?
[14:16:40] <unnu> it goes well
[14:16:56] <unnu> i was kinda sick there for a while
[14:17:33] <unnu> damn seasons and alergies and such
[14:17:35] <unnu> lol
[14:24:45] <jphase> yeah, I hear ya
[14:25:06] <crankharder> does .animate() leverage css3 transitions when available?
[14:25:26] <crankharder> specifically, I'm only animating the left/right attributes of an absolute positioned element
[14:25:47] <crankharder> ...it's a bit choppy on some mobile devices,s o wondering what css3 options are available, and if they work better
[14:30:36] <Rinthe> how do i check if there's no scrolling?
[14:33:57] <jphase> Rinthe: http://hastebin.com/bifahesuja.lisp
[14:35:05] <Rinthe> jphase: thx
[14:36:21] <jphase> crankharder: if there are transitions on the element then any css property that you change will transition (whether that's via jQuery or css3 hovers or w/e)
[14:42:47] <Rinthe> jphase: .scrolltop() works too
[14:50:46] <Rinthe> I'm using this code to load infinite scroll again onload incase the browser window is too long. Sometimes the browser window is so long that it needs to load more than once to get scroll bar. anyone know how i can do this? http://hastebin.com/yabawocare.rb
[14:57:26] <Rinthe> anyone
[14:59:49] <SDr> Rinthe, $(document).height()  gets you the total height of the rendered page; $(window).height() gets you the viewport's height
[15:00:17] <Rinthe> SDr: I'm using this code to load infinite scroll again onload incase the browser window is too long. Sometimes the browser window is so long that it needs to load more than once to get scroll bar. anyone know how i can do this? http://hastebin.com/yabawocare.rb
[15:00:35] <SDr> Rinthe, so eg. i = 0; while ($(document).height() < $(window).height()) {  loadArticle(i); i += 1; }
[15:02:37] <Rinthe> SDr: how about scrolltop()? all i need to check for is if there's a scrollbar right?
[15:04:24] <SDr> Rinthe,  $(document).scrollTop()   will return the position of the viewport relative to the document. at page init, this will be 0 regardless of page's height
[15:04:51] <Rinthe> SDr: it returns 0 when there's no scrollbar tho
[15:04:56] <SDr> Rinthe, viewport = what your browser is rendering currently
[15:05:18] <SDr> Rinthe, it will also return 0 when the document is larger than the viewport
[15:05:28] <SDr> Rinthe, since it's the scrollbar's position.
[15:05:38] <Rinthe> okay
[15:05:55] <Rinthe> ur code isnt working tho
[15:06:06] <Rinthe> SDr: it's not loading at all
[15:06:23] <Rinthe> SDr: http://hastebin.com/vanapocori.rb
[15:06:23] <SDr> Rinthe, what's the error message?
[15:06:39] <Rinthe> no error message
[15:06:52] <Rinthe> it loads the initial, but if the browser is too long it doesn't load again
[15:07:33] <SDr> Rinthe, erm, you haven't increased the count variable, and I suspect loadArticle requires the no# of the articles to load
[15:08:22] <Rinthe> SDr: loadArticle: has count++
[15:08:35] <Rinthe> loadarticle has count++ *
[15:09:16] <Rinthe> SDr: even if count isnt increased, it should return the same page. but it is increased
[15:09:37] <SDr> Rinthe, can you link to the site in question, please?
[15:09:52] <Rinthe> SDr: pmed
[15:10:42] <Rinthe> SDr: oh shouldnt it be > instead of <
[15:33:17] <Rinthe> SDr: I'm using this code to load infinite scroll again onload incase the browser window is too long. Sometimes the browser window is so long that it needs to load more than once to get scroll bar. anyone know how i can do this? http://hastebin.com/yabawocare.rb
[15:33:40] <Rinthe> ops sry
[15:33:52] <Rinthe> I tried using while() but that just makes the page not load at all

[15:49:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i cant see it
[15:56:27] <dwarder> can i distinguish between clicking and trigger('click') ?
[15:56:42] <dwarder> withing event handler
[15:57:06] <Kruptein> hi, I have a bunch of <aside data-number="x"> and I want to match a certain <aside> but for some reason $("aside[data-number='1']") for example doesnt work
[16:02:35] <Velveeta> kruptein: can you put it up on a jsfiddle?
[16:02:40] <Velveeta> an example of it i mean?
[16:03:05] <Velveeta> dwarder: you might be able to check event.which in the event handler
[16:03:41] <Velveeta> it should be a valid value in the case of an actual click, but in the event of a trigger click, it may be undefined
[16:09:29] <Velveeta> dwarder: http://jsfiddle.net/FKcSk/1/
[16:10:58] <dwarder> Velveeta: there is also e.isTrigger, thank you
[16:11:03] <systemfault> HI LOL!
[16:12:25] <Velveeta> dwarder: nice, i learned something new, i love when that happens :D
[16:14:40] <dwarder> Velveeta: :)
[16:15:17] <Cyclohexane> How come $('#id').val('1').change(); seems to work but the actual <select> dropdown in the form doesn't change (it works if i run it from console but not from the script)?
[16:16:06] <Cyclohexane> i know it's working because the change() event is triggered
[16:17:04] <Velveeta> cyclohexane: can you put an example up on jsfiddle?
[16:17:51] <Velveeta> the call to .val should be enough to change the value itself, but not trigger the change event, since it doesn't trigger from programmatic changes, which is why you have to explicitly call it to trigger that eventâ€¦ but it shouldn't be necessary for the purpose of strictly changing the value
[16:28:00] <jned> anyone can help me use setInterval please: http://jsfiddle.net/xkRdC/
[16:31:13] <jphase> tp43_: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/xkRdC/1/
[16:31:18] <jphase> gotta call your function again
[16:32:04] <tp43_> jphase, I can't see the code, it set to every sec it seems
[16:32:13] <jphase> woops
[16:32:21] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/xkRdC/2/
[16:32:41] <jphase> hmm, sec
[16:33:07] <Velveeta> jned: you need to pass that function to your setInterval by name, not executing it, e.g. don't pass refresh(), just pass refresh
[16:38:07] <tp43_> Velveeta, thx, I see what you mean.  I don't really understand that part of javascript. I have no idea about the difference.
[16:38:53] <Velveeta> tp43_: when you pass it with parentheses, you're invoking the function, meaning you're actually passing the return of that function into setInterval, vs the function itself
[16:39:11] <Velveeta> so if that function returned a function itself, that would be valid, but it doesn't return anything, so it actually returns undefined
[16:39:13] <tp43_> Velveeta, oooh, thx so much
[16:39:18] <Velveeta> no problem
[16:39:37] <Velveeta> when you pass it as just a name, you're passing that named function reference to setInterval, and it executes that reference each time its interval expires
[16:40:00] <tp43_> I see
[16:40:28] <tp43_> Velveeta, thx again, yeah, I needed to learn that
[16:40:54] <Velveeta> not a problem, i'm here to teach :)
[16:52:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: what up?
[16:53:12] <Velveeta> Nada, working on a blog post right now, one I'd meant to start on like 2 weeks ago :)
[17:03:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[17:14:10] <cusco> hi folks
[17:14:23] <cusco> I have a function(parm) that calls on .ajax
[17:14:53] <cusco> and on success: function(msg){ here I want to set a return var to msg.prop}
[17:15:03] <cusco> but seems that the var is not available
[17:15:09] <cusco> what am I doing wrong?
[17:16:11] <sahbeewah> cusco, the function returns before it waits for the ajax call to do its business
[17:16:27] <cusco> ahh right its async
[17:16:32] <cusco> well
[17:16:49] <cusco> I cant set a global var and have ajax set its value, right?
[17:17:33] <sahbeewah> you could. that doesn't solve any underlying problem that you'd be having though
[17:18:01] <cusco> nah its just a workarround, instead of returning it I'll just set a var for later use
[17:18:49] <Velveeta> you'd be better off tying the functionality that requires that var to a deferred object that you can resolve with the ajax request
[17:19:08] <cusco> can you rpovide a example?
[17:19:28] <Velveeta> kind ofâ€¦ i can whip up a jsfiddle to demonstrate it, but i don't know if it'll let me make an actual request from it
[17:20:09] <cusco> nvm the request, just so I understand what you mean on a deferred object
[17:25:02] <Velveeta> here's a rough example, all commented out to prevent errors in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n5rKf/
[17:25:49] <Velveeta> so that's an example case where you would declare a variable, fire off an ajax request, set the myVar variable to your msg.prop value in the success handler, and then after the request, you try to console.log it, which would fire immediately and show undefined because of the async nature of the request
[17:26:31] <Velveeta> alternatively, you could create a deferred object, wrap your code in an anonymous function passed to the deferred's "done" callback chain, and resolve it in your success function, so that it console.logs your value after it's been set
[17:26:50] <Velveeta> now, ajax itself returns a deferred object, so you could technically just move the code from that anonymous function into your success handler itself
[17:27:08] <cusco> ok; I understood the deferred() example
[17:27:16] <Velveeta> or you could assign the return of the $.ajax to your deferred variable, and it will autoresolve itself when the request completes
[17:27:25] <cusco> thanks
[17:27:29] <Velveeta> no problem
[17:32:02] <nafta_> is $('#markup').click(function () { $('markupPrice').toggle(this.checked); }); and setting <div style="display:none" id="markupPrice"></div> the best way to hide or show something depending on if a checkbox has been checked?
[17:42:23] <sticky_> hi all! i set up colorbox for my site, but i donÂ´t know how to make appear in the colorbox the html title="My text". How to say colorbox to show title? i put title property to true, but what i get is the word true in all teh pictures, and not the title i write in html. Can someone help?
[17:58:51] <Velveeta> have you tried setting the title property to "My text" ?
[18:08:09] <sticky_> Velveeta: i find why was not recognized. i write title tag in the thumbnail, not in the image :D fixed
[18:08:46] <nafta_> Velveeta: how can I make the value of a input field to show a result of other fields?
[18:10:34] <nafta_> right now I'm trying this       $(function(){ $('input[name="quantity"]').on('change keyup', function(){ $('input[name="clientInvestment"]').val($(this).val() * $('input[name="clientPrice"]').val()); $(this).trigger('change');}); }); but the problem I'm facing isâ€¦everything works fine when I change the value at quantityâ€¦.but when I change the value of clientPrice I have to go back to change the quantity in order to make the final value to update...
[18:10:46] <nafta_> hope that I made myself understandable
[18:10:47] <nafta_> hehe
[18:14:19] <nafta_> anyone? :(
[18:30:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta_: first create a jsfiddle dont paste code
[18:31:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> then you dont have to worry about understandability
[18:34:41] <nafta_> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/6KNdN/
[18:34:49] <nafta_> I don't know how to set it up
[18:34:57] <nafta_> but there's pretty much it
[18:35:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry can you explain issue again
[18:35:29] <nafta_> I want to be able to multiply a form to other form
[18:35:33] <nafta_> simple math
[18:35:36] <nafta_> but I don't know how
[18:35:45] <nafta_> and then show the result on another input
[18:36:31] <nafta_> in the fiddle it won't work at al
[18:36:32] <nafta_> l
[18:36:41] <nafta_> but I have it workingâ€¦.partially at localhost
[18:36:45] <nafta_> *shrug*
[18:37:34] <nafta_> the problem isâ€¦that it is working great only if I change the values at "quantity" but if then I change the value at clientPriceâ€¦it won't update the clientInvestment
[18:39:05] <nafta_> Rohan_Bhangui: is it understandable?
[18:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya makes sense (despite the language is in spanish)
[18:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> do you have a onchange listener attacehd to clientPrice?
[18:40:23] <nafta_> no, how can I do that?
[18:40:24] <nafta_> haha
[18:40:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> well like your doing
[18:40:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("#foo").on("change", function()....
[18:41:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> change will not only detect keyboard input
[18:41:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> but also pasted content
[18:41:41] <Velveeta> yeah, i would make your calculation function a separate, named function: function calculateTotal() or something
[18:41:59] <Velveeta> and then add a change event to both of the relevant intput fields and make the callback your calculateTotal function
[18:42:15] <Velveeta> sorry, was stuffing my face for a few minutes :)
[18:42:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[18:42:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta_: there you go
[18:42:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> although I would have avoided the function....but its a good idea
[18:43:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: nafta_  only needs a change listener right
[18:43:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> doesnt need both a keyup and change
[18:44:34] <Velveeta> well, i would do *either* a keyup or a change, but yeah, both aren't really necessary
[18:44:48] <Velveeta> unless something is programmatically changing the value and triggering a change event or something, outside of user interaction
[18:45:20] <Velveeta> a keyup listener will give the user instant gratification on their input, the change event would lighten the overhead, but wouldn't fire until blur
[18:45:35] <Velveeta> also, make sure you add in some error handling for NaN conditions
[18:46:43] <nafta_> hrmm
[18:46:46] <nafta_> I'm having another proble
[18:46:47] <nafta_> m
[18:47:12] * Velveeta swirls his arms in the air, Matrix-style, and motions with one hand to "bring it".
[18:47:19] <nafta_> haha
[18:47:25] <nafta_> I'm getting a weird number
[18:47:40] <Velveeta> you may need to run it through a number constructor, or parseFloat
[18:47:47] <Velveeta> because technically it's operating on string data
[18:48:02] <Velveeta> it *should* explicitly convert it to number when it sees the * operator, but who knows, js is quirky like that
[18:49:36] <nafta_> I'm not doing a total function..since I wouldn't know where to start
[18:50:02] <nafta_> I'm working with what I have right now..and I tried to duplicate the function to make a on('change') for the clientPrice
[18:50:23] <nafta_> and now I'm getting a "made by satan" number that I don't know where it comes from
[18:50:26] <Velveeta> that's the thing, you've already written the total function
[18:50:26] <nafta_> lol
[18:50:42] <Velveeta> you wrote it for one of your change handlers
[18:50:56] <Velveeta> rather than duplicating it into the other change handler, just break it out into a named function, and pass the name to each of those handlers
[18:51:11] <nafta_> ok hold on a sex
[18:51:13] <nafta_> err
[18:51:14] <nafta_> sec
[18:51:18] <Velveeta> rawr
[18:51:59] <nafta_> dumb question..how can I name a function in jquery?
[18:52:00] <nafta_> hehe
[18:52:07] <nafta_> function total ()?
[18:52:16] <Velveeta> you don't need to name it in jquery, just standard js, and yes, that's the correct syntax
[18:54:49] <nafta_>       $('input[name="quantity"]').on('change', function total());
[18:54:56] <nafta_> is that crazy?
[18:55:30] <Velveeta> not like that, after you've created your function and put your logic in it, you'll pass it as your handler like this:
[18:55:38] <Velveeta> $('input[name="quantity"]').on('change', total);
[18:55:49] <febley> Hello there, im building a little slideshow for my page. It works fine but, i have one little issue. I've set the slideshow container overflow hidden,  now if i animate the image-containers position (e.g. left -220px) the images pop in and out. Any idea how to fix
[19:02:55] <PhaseCode> Evening guys!
[19:04:45] <nimbiotics> Is there an open source jquery carousel that looks like yahoo's home page carousel?
[19:17:38] <nafta_> Velveeta: now I do need some serious help
[19:17:40] <nafta_> lol
[19:17:47] <Velveeta> fer serious?
[19:18:40] <nafta_> yeah
[19:18:45] <nafta_> I got it working
[19:19:09] <nafta_> here it isâ€¦http://jsfiddle.net/6KNdN/1/ it doesn't work on the fiddleâ€¦but it is working here
[19:19:10] <nafta_> lol
[19:19:19] <Velveeta> so then you do or don't need serious help now?
[19:19:51] <nafta_> nowâ€¦I want to sumâ€¦or subtractâ€¦the value of clientInvestment and RefInvestmentâ€¦depending on if it is a sale or a buy
[19:20:21] <nafta_> which is given by the first select with id="transactionType"
[19:21:11] <nafta_> waitâ€¦I always want to substract but always getting a regular number
[19:21:22] <nafta_> not a negative oneâ€¦and that depends if I'm buying or selling
[19:21:53] <nafta_> Velveeta: do you know anyone that would do this for me and accept money thru paypal? :D
[19:22:00] <Velveeta> well, right off the bat, i can spot what looks like a set of infinite loops
[19:22:04] <nafta_> I also need to populate some fields thru mysql
[19:22:29] <Velveeta> nafta_: off the top of my head, i don'tâ€¦ you might try some of the freelance sites like rentacoder.com or guru.com though
[19:23:09] <Velveeta> i can point out up front though, that your event listeners for your change events, are themselves triggering change on the element in question, which would probably cause an infinite loop
[19:23:56] <nafta_> but right now it seems to be working fine
[19:23:58] <Velveeta> there's no reason to explicitly call $(this).trigger('change') from within a change event, because it's already processing the current change event, so it's already been fired
[19:24:00] <nafta_> it gives me the right number
[19:25:13] <nafta_> I removed that
[19:25:18] <nafta_> thanks
[19:25:41] <Velveeta> no problem
[19:26:39] <Velveeta> outside of that, i don't have enough blood in my alcohol system currently to try to wade through the logic of that stuff and point out what you might want to do, and i my day job and other stuff keep me too busy to do any freelance work these days, so the business logic you're trying to hammer up is gonna be in your court for now :)
[19:27:10] <nafta_> alright
[19:27:13] <nafta_> thanks a lot anyways
[19:27:15] <nafta_> ;)
[19:27:46] <Erneston> hi

[19:28:22] <Erneston> lol
[19:28:28] <Erneston> yeah sorted that one
[19:28:38] <Erneston> that was nothing major
[19:28:43] <Velveeta> weren't you asking earlier how to control your sprite animation?
[19:29:05] <Erneston> erm not sure
[19:29:15] <Erneston> ive managed to get a css sprite to play on load
[19:29:22] <Erneston> but not on hover of element
[19:29:53] <Erneston> i originally wanted it so as the user scrolls the css animation moves the background-position to the next part
[19:30:03] <Erneston> so the scroll controls the frame
[19:30:38] <Velveeta> right, that's the question i remember
[19:30:57] <Velveeta> as far as doing it on hover, have you looked into css keyframes?
[19:31:10] <Erneston> let me open doc again
[19:31:19] <Ricaz> Is there a way to get an event when the page gets 'focus' again? If I use setInterval() and go to another tab, the interval will be paused in the meantime
[19:31:27] <Erneston> yeah i used keyframes to play animation
[19:31:41] <Erneston> going to trigger it on hover
[19:31:49] <Erneston> but i also want it to reverse on mouseoff
[19:32:10] <Velveeta> ricaz: this is entirely a guess, but maybe $('body').on('focus') and 'blur' ?
[19:32:57] <Velveeta> erneston: no clue, you're getting way more complicated than what i've played with in css :)
[19:33:08] <Erneston> ill keep it simple
[19:33:25] <Erneston> hover to active the animation is my next test case
[19:33:37] <Erneston> then scroll to animate
[19:34:07] <Velveeta> well, i mean in general, this use case is more complicated than anything i've had need for, scroll to animate through css background-positions on a sprited image, then another background-position animation for hover, and a reversal of that on mouseleave
[19:34:35] <Erneston> in theory sounds ok
[19:34:55] <Velveeta> my gut would say to try to find a way to do it with a transition that would automatically handle that on mouseenter and mouseleave, but i don't know if you can use keyframes with a transition, and if so, the support is probably minimal
[19:35:15] <Velveeta> well, in theory, the mouseleave portion of it sounds like it's going to require js intervention vs a pure css method
[19:35:26] <Velveeta> but i guess your scroll method may have required that already
[19:36:17] <Erneston> am not sure how i will get the scroll effect working
[19:36:37] <Erneston> i was hoping to use .scroll()  to change bg position, but the background image will be moving up at the same time
[19:36:51] <Erneston> so the height of 100% may need to be 110% ?
[19:36:53] <Velveeta> so you haven't gotten that solved yet? i thought you said a little while ago that you fixed that earlier problem and it wasn't anything too big
[19:37:13] <Erneston> i fixed a jsfiddle issue which i asked for help on :p
[19:37:23] <Velveeta> well, the background-position would be completely separate from its location in the page
[19:37:45] <Velveeta> you should be able to animate its background-position without worrying about your scrollTop if that's what you're talking about
[19:37:48] <Erneston> imagine a fixed image in the centre of a window,
[19:38:16] <Erneston> once you scroll to this area, the next scroll action will change the frame, to make it look like an animation
[19:38:37] <Erneston> without the background scrolling, but when the animation is finished the scroll can then continue down the page
[19:38:42] <Erneston> changing the background
[19:39:35] <Erneston> using waypoint.js :)
[19:39:39] <Erneston> so i know which part am at
[19:39:40] <Velveeta> gotcha
[19:39:51] <Velveeta> i haven't used waypoint myself, but am familiar w/ it
[19:39:57] <Erneston> but within that the background must pause
[19:40:03] <Velveeta> right
[19:40:14] <Erneston> parallex scrolling
[19:40:43] <Erneston> maybe its best using hover
[19:40:51] <Erneston> to start animation
[19:44:02] <Erneston> i give up for 2nite
[19:57:17] <Erneston> nite all
[19:57:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> nite
[20:15:22] <nafta_> I want to sum two input form fields and show the result in another input fieldâ€¦.but I never get to touch the field where the result should appearâ€¦how can I do this?
[20:15:27] <nafta_> this is driving me crazy
[20:15:27] <nafta_> lol
[20:15:46] <Velveeta> what do you mean you never get to touch the field where it'll appear?
[20:15:53] <Velveeta> you mean, as a user, or even via js?
[20:15:59] <nafta_> no, as a user
[20:16:11] <nafta_> I can't do on('change')
[20:16:16] <nafta_> because I never change it
[20:16:18] <Velveeta> do you need to touch that field as a user in order to sum it from other fields?
[20:16:31] <nafta_> noâ€¦I just need to sum those fields
[20:16:38] <nafta_> and show the result on another input field
[20:17:11] <Velveeta> and the field that displays the result is the one you're asking about?
[20:17:19] <nafta_> yes
[20:17:30] <Velveeta> why do you need to worry about that field at all if you're just displaying the result there?
[20:18:11] <nafta_> then how can I tell query to sum those fields without action?
[20:18:25] <nafta_> there's something I'm not getting about all this
[20:18:27] <nafta_> hehe
[20:18:35] <Velveeta> so, let's call these fields 1, 2, and 3
[20:18:42] <nafta_> ok
[20:18:46] <Velveeta> fields 1 and 2 hold the values you're summing, and 3 just displays the result, right?
[20:18:51] <nafta_> yes
[20:19:01] <Velveeta> and 1 and 2 are both editable by the user right? and 3 isn't..
[20:19:16] <nafta_> no, I get values 1 and 2 from the functions we already worked on
[20:19:29] <nafta_> none of the values are editable by the user
[20:19:50] <Velveeta> ok, so fields 1 and 2 are autopopulated by some *other* javascript that's calculated based on some other user-editable fields?
[20:19:59] <nafta_> yes
[20:20:38] <Velveeta> ok, so then create a function that sums those 2 fields, and anytime you programmatically change their values based on the user-editable fields, call that function to auto-sum those 2 fields and store the result in input 3
[20:21:00] <Velveeta> so your change events on the user-editable fields are currently storing their calculations in fields 1 and 2
[20:21:22] <Velveeta> and at the time those change functions trigger to store the results of their own calculations in fields 1 and 2, fire the function that updates input 3 from inputs 1 and 2
[20:26:32] <nafta_> Velveeta: if I do this $(function markupProfit(){ var markupProfitTotal = $('input[name="refInvestment"]').val() + $('input[name="clientInvestment"').val(); }); I should be getting the result on that variable without issuesâ€¦right?
[20:27:27] <Velveeta> not exactly, because those val() functions are gonna return the string representation of the numbers in those inputs, and if you do string + string in javascript, it will concatenate them as opposed to doing a mathematical operation
[20:27:57] <nafta_> oh..I have to parseInt
[20:28:12] <Velveeta> right, or pass them through a Number() constructor, or parseFloat
[20:28:25] <Velveeta> if you use parseInt, make sure you pass a radix value of 10 for the 2nd parameter
[20:28:51] <nafta_> nowâ€¦after I have that variable how can I make it show in the other input field?
[20:29:18] <Velveeta> also, javascript does its typecasting based on the first operand of the expression i'm pretty sure, meaning you could probably also prefix those .val() calls with like: 0 +
[20:29:20] <Velveeta> and it would probably work
[20:29:43] <Velveeta> you would want to write a separate function to sum fields 1 and 2, and store the result in field 3
[20:30:00] <Velveeta> and after that change function sets the value of field 1 or 2, whichever one it applies to, call your function that sums for field 3
[20:30:09] <Velveeta> i'll whip up a quick jsfiddle
[20:34:23] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/YTmZv/
[20:34:31] <nafta_> this is what I'm trying to do
[20:34:54] <Velveeta> i'm not gonna wade through all of that right now, i'll show you a jsfiddle of my own to demonstrate what i'm talking about
[20:35:06] <nafta_> alright
[20:35:13] <nafta_> thanks a lot
[20:37:38] <fairuz> Hi guys. Is it possible to add additional parameters to the request argument of source in jQuery's autocomplete?
[20:41:01] <Velveeta> nafta_: http://jsfiddle.net/gz76G/3/
[20:42:44] <nafta_> Velveeta: thanks a lot
[20:42:47] <nafta_> gonna read on
[20:43:45] <Velveeta> no problem, you'll see that instead of manually firing the function to update field 7, i'm binding it to a change event on updateField5/6, and triggering change in each of those fields' calculation functions
[20:44:14] <Velveeta> so the point is that when the user changes a field that they *are* allowed to change, and they update a given field, that field in turn fires its own change event, which forces the "total" field to update itself
[20:44:30] <Velveeta> and i added some sanity checks for NaN conditions, to default to 0
[20:47:49] <nafta_> Velveeta: I love you
[20:47:54] <nafta_> what does View does?
[20:48:15] <Velveeta> that's just a place i'm caching those DOM lookups so i don't have to parse for them every time i hit one of those change events
[20:48:37] <Velveeta> cache the references once at document load time, and then just reference those properties like View.field1 instead of $('#field1')
[20:48:50] <nafta_> awesome
[20:49:04] <nafta_> I understand it better like this
[20:49:09] <nafta_> thanks a ton
[20:49:18] <Velveeta> good, i tried to make it in a fairly generic fashion so you could see what i was talking about
[20:49:32] <Velveeta> from there, you should be able to abstract it out for your own code's purposes :)
[20:49:47] <nafta_> yesâ€¦I am right now
[20:55:59] <crankharder> is there a good reason why .on('keyup'.. would only bind to the first element in the collection?
[20:56:27] <Velveeta> crankharder: not any good reason that i can think of...
[21:23:17] <nafta_> Velveeta: I tried to use the same code you made
[21:23:23] <nafta_> but something is not working right
[21:23:32] <nafta_> perhaps you could take a tiny look
[21:23:33] <nafta_> :D
[21:23:34] <yellowfish> developers, in your humble opinion, whats the easiest and most versatile JS framework?
[21:25:36] <Velveeta> yellowfish: that depends entirely on the needs of your applicationâ€¦ "easiest and most versatile" is a relative description that's gonna depend on what you're trying to accomplish in the end
[21:25:44] <Velveeta> nafta_: jsfiddle link?
[21:26:06] <nafta_> I'm building itâ€¦so it is easier for you to take a look at
[21:26:18] <Velveeta> ok
[21:27:13] <yellowfish> I'm making a simple webapp where it you read different links, and you track points
[21:27:26] <yellowfish> so a very simple and popular MVC
[21:27:33] <yellowfish> needs to be fast, but also intuitive to use
[21:28:08] <Velveeta> do you require 2-way data binding? reusable web components? or just something simple for scaffolding?
[21:28:23] <Velveeta> i might recommend angular for one of the first 2, or backbone for the last one
[21:30:38] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/
[21:30:40] <nafta_> there it is
[21:30:43] <nafta_> thanks again
[21:31:38] <Velveeta> have you checked your javascript console yet?
[21:32:05] <nafta_> yes, I try
[21:32:22] <nafta_> no errors
[21:32:25] <Velveeta> because i got an error right off the bat (after adding jquery to the fiddle)
[21:32:35] <Velveeta> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'val' of null
[21:33:12] <nafta_> wtf
[21:33:54] <Velveeta> your View.cientInvestment reference is undefined
[21:34:18] <Velveeta> your View.refInvestment one is undefined also
[21:34:30] <nafta_> I always get If <script> tags have a 'type' attribute, it should equal 'text/javascript' or 'application/javascript'. Also scripts must be parsable (syntactically correct).
[21:34:38] <Velveeta> and View.markupPrice.. you're only defining the first 2, View.quantity and View.clientPrice
[21:35:51] <nafta_> well, I just wanted to test if I could get the first two values
[21:35:53] <nafta_> to keep going
[21:36:29] <Velveeta> ok, well the example won't work fully for me to find the actual issue until you finish defining things that aren't gonna throw reference errors like that
[21:37:50] <nafta_> ok
[21:57:25] <nafta_> Velveeta: I found the problem I'm havingâ€¦on your fiddleâ€¦I use field3 and field1â€¦.but in my scriptâ€¦I only have one of those to make the math
[21:57:52] <nafta_> I meanâ€¦field2 and field4 both use the same multiplier
[21:58:02] <Velveeta> gotcha
[21:58:03] <nafta_> which in this case would be field1
[21:59:20] <PhaseCode> .
[22:03:53] <nafta_> I can't seem to be able to use the same quantity
[22:04:19] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what to tell you without a fiddle link to look at
[22:04:29] <nafta_> lol
[22:04:32] <nafta_> sorry
[22:04:33] <nafta_> hold on
[22:06:35] <nafta_> wait
[22:06:36] <nafta_> WTF
[22:06:45] <nafta_> it is working on fiddle but not in my laptop
[22:06:47] <nafta_> O_o
[22:07:20] <nafta_> how is this possible?
[22:07:48] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/3/
[22:07:50] <nafta_> take a look
[22:07:57] <nafta_> butâ€¦it is actually working there
[22:08:08] <nafta_> but it is not working locally
[22:08:09] <nafta_> wtf
[22:08:23] <nafta_> maybe I have to move the script to the head?
[22:08:26] <Velveeta> is your console showing any errors?
[22:08:39] <Velveeta> you shouldn't need to move the script to the head, since it's binding everything up in document.ready
[22:11:56] <nafta_> Velveeta: I found the problemâ€¦in my file locallyâ€¦I have those fields hiddenâ€¦and they show if I click certain check
[22:12:05] <nafta_> I removed the hiddenâ€¦and now it is working
[22:12:18] <shcked> Needing a little help
[22:12:24] <nafta_> the problem isâ€¦.I need to hide themâ€¦and make it work if someone checks the check
[22:12:25] <Velveeta> weird, it wasn't processing the change events while they were hidden or what?
[22:12:33] <nafta_> apparently
[22:12:35] <shcked> Anyone know why my effect isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/shcked/gLvdB/
[22:12:52] <nafta_> Velveeta: I'm going to show you in the fiddle the whole form as I had it
[22:13:02] <Velveeta> nafta_: well, you don't have to bind a change event to handle that math on the hidden elements, just fire the function manually that their change event would be triggering
[22:14:49] <Velveeta> shcked: the object you're passing with the fx property is meant to be passed as its own standalone parameter to the tabs function, because it's an actual option on the widget
[22:15:14] <Velveeta> at least that's what i got out of reading up on it
[22:15:22] <Velveeta> check this SO post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1350666/jquery-ui-tabs-available-fx-options
[22:15:48] <shcked> Velveeta: Ah
[22:17:31] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/4/
[22:19:03] <Velveeta> nafta_: so remove the trigger change from updateField5 and 6, and manually invoke the updateField7 function there
[22:20:17] <nafta_> from there? from where?
[22:20:19] <nafta_> :P
[22:20:36] <Velveeta> from your updateField5 and 6 functions
[22:20:47] <Velveeta> get your head in the game :D
[22:34:08] <nafta_> I'm not even getting updateField6 to work when it is hidden
[22:34:17] <nafta_> I'm not even getting to the sum part
[22:36:35] <Velveeta> my console shows an error about the jCombo plugin you're referencing in the jsfiddle link, so i can't check any of the functionality after that line
[22:39:48] <nafta_> Velveeta: this one is working fine
[22:39:51] <nafta_> http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/5/
[22:39:54] <nafta_> no jcombo thingy
[22:40:06] <nafta_> you can see that Client Investment shows nice
[22:40:10] <nafta_> but not the hidden ones
[22:42:11] <Velveeta> you're still not calling updateField7 manually from either of those functions
[22:42:55] <nafta_> oh that's old
[22:45:17] <nafta_> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/7/
[22:45:20] <nafta_> that's the new one
[22:45:53] <Velveeta> how long have you been working with javascript?
[22:46:38] <nafta_> Velveeta: 2 hours
[22:46:39] <nafta_> haha
[22:46:46] <Velveeta> no wonder
[22:46:49] <nafta_> :(
[22:47:06] <Velveeta> you're invoking that function completely wrong, you had it written properly originally, and just needed to call it from each of those functions
[22:47:14] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/6HTUR/8/
[22:47:59] <Velveeta> you really need to spend some time learning the language itself, or else anybody you ask for help in here is going to have to end up writing your code for you rather than actually helping
[22:48:58] <nafta_> Velveeta: I'm sorry, I understand..I'll keep reading and see how I can get to understand it..you are right
[22:49:13] <Velveeta> do you see the changes i made in that latest jsfiddle?
[22:49:49] <nafta_> yes, I see them..but it still works only for the client Priceâ€¦and not the hidden ones
[22:50:27] <Velveeta> what is it supposed to be doing for the hidden ones?
[22:50:57] <nafta_> I should be getting Ref Investment from the Markup Price * Quantity
[22:51:10] <nafta_> MarkUp Price shows up when I check Got Markup
[22:51:11] <nafta_> ?
[22:52:02] <nafta_> if I remove the hidden property from those divsâ€¦it works propertly
[22:52:13] <fairuz> Hi guys. Let say I accidently initialize jQuery's autocomplete on an element twice. Can I safely assume the first one will be discarded?
[22:52:24] <nafta_> that's what I don't getâ€¦wellâ€¦beside other obvious things as calling a function inside other function hehe
[22:54:36] <Velveeta> you're using refInvestment as an id on more than one element
[22:54:43] <Velveeta> ^^ nafta_
[22:55:14] <Velveeta> fairuz: you mean if you do something like this? $(myEl).autocomplete(); $(myEl).autocomplete();
[22:55:37] <fairuz> Velveeta: Yes exactly
[22:56:33] <Velveeta> fairuz: you don't actually instantiate it twice, it's only instantiated onceâ€¦ the _init function will fire for the 2nd time you call that, but in a lot of widgets, _init isn't really used, so nothing will actually happen.. i'm not sure about autocomplete's _init function
[22:57:27] <nafta_> Velveeta: for the love of god
[22:57:46] <nafta_> no comments..
[22:58:08] <nafta_> thanks again Velveeta
[22:58:21] <Velveeta> fairuz: i just read into its source, it doesn't use _init internally either, so that 2nd call wouldn't do anything
[22:58:39] <Velveeta> nafta_: no problem
[23:00:30] <fairuz> Velveeta: ah ok
[23:01:25] <fairuz> So is there any way to "destroy" the first instance?
[23:02:13] <Velveeta> yepyep, $(myEl).autocomplete('destroy')
[23:03:05] <Velveeta> you'll want to wrap it in a check to make sure it's an actual autocomplete, because as of jquery ui 1.9 i believe, they won't allow you to fire widget functions on non-widgets, so you can't fire destroy on it if it's already been destroyed
[23:03:31] <Velveeta> so you'd want to do something like: if ($(myEl).is(':ui-autocomplete')) { $(myEl).autocomplete('destroy'); }
[23:04:11] <fairuz> Velveeta: ah ok, That's great. Thanks
[23:04:58] <Velveeta> :)
[23:06:18] <nafta_> Velveeta: I promise I won't bother you again..but I would like to learn one more thing. My first field of the form is a selectâ€¦which throws a value 1 or 2 depending on what you select. I would like my function updateField7 that sums upâ€¦to depend on that value selectedâ€¦ something like if(#select value==1) { do this } else { do that } what would the correct syntax be? I want to have this if inside the functions updateField5 and updateField6â€¦I just want 
[23:06:19] <nafta_> know the right syntax to achieve this..thanks.
[23:06:34] <fairuz> Velveeta: I have doubts now. Destroying and re-initialize seems a bit overkill for what I want to do actually. :) I use a framework where the autocomplete code is embedded deep inside the framework and I want to avoid to change that.
[23:06:59] <fairuz> Actually what I just want to do is to inject additional data to the data attribute of the autocomplete's source.
[23:07:30] <fairuz> I don't see any API for that, thus my idea to destroy and re-initialize the autocomplete
[23:07:37] <Velveeta> nafta_: it's not a bother, it's what i'm here for, i'm just saying that going forward, some of the items you've had trouble with here are basic javascript constructs, like just invoking a function, and you need to at least learn the basics of the language if you're gonna be asking for help.. it'd be like me walking into a hospital and saying "can you help me perform surgery on my wife? here, show me how"
[23:08:15] <Betal> whats wrong here? $( "#mydiv" ).load( "script.php", { f: $("#myinput").val() }, function() { alert( "It works" ); }); // the alert happens, but the parameter isn't passed to the server, but using "script.php?f=" + $("#myinput").val() it is passed
[23:08:21] <Velveeta> fairuz: when you say data attribute, do you mean just adding a data-something="" attribute to the element that's getting an autocompleter initialized?
[23:08:27] <nafta_> yes, I understand
[23:08:34] <nafta_> thanks again
[23:09:25] <Velveeta> nafta_: as to your question, you'll want to check something like: if ($('#yourSelect').val() == 1) { do this } else { do that }
[23:09:41] <Velveeta> you pretty much have that syntax down in your own example, you just need to use your actual select element reference
[23:10:50] <fairuz> Velveeta: No. For example: $(elem).autocomplete({source: function(request, response) {  //ajax thing here }});
[23:11:17] <fairuz> Right now the text filled in by user is available in request.term
[23:11:20] <Velveeta> fairuz: does it support a source parameter that takes a function w/ that signature?
[23:12:02] <Velveeta> betal: the documentation says if you provide an object for that 2nd parameter, it sends the request as a POST vs GET
[23:12:17] <fairuz> Velveeta: Yes. It is what I see they use in the said framework
[23:12:26] <Velveeta> are you checking POST vars on the back end, or just GET vars? your 2nd example: ?f=whatever is in the format of a GET request
[23:12:33] <fairuz> I wonder if how I can add something to the request object
[23:13:11] <fairuz> I check post
[23:13:23] <Velveeta> fairuz: if you want to modify the request object (i'm assuming without modifying *all* requests from any source), it'll be a lot more effort than you're thinking, i believe
[23:13:33] <Velveeta> fairuz: that GET vs POST comment was for betal, not you :)
[23:13:41] <fairuz> Velveeta: oh sorry
[23:14:19] <fairuz> Velveeta: So that's why I'm thinking to just destroy the instance made by the framework and create my own
[23:14:23] <fairuz> Is that sane?
[23:15:03] <Betal> Velveeta: oh!, true, thanks :D
[23:16:33] <Betal> Velveeta: is possible use GET?
[23:16:55] <Velveeta> betal: if you pass that 2nd parameter as a string instead of an object
[23:17:20] <Velveeta> 'f=' + $('#myInput').val()
[23:17:36] <Velveeta> fairuz: if you can make it work by destroying and reinstantiating it, then i'd say go that route
[23:17:59] <fairuz> Velveeta: Thanks for being very helpful. :)
[23:18:56] <Velveeta> fairus: no problem, good luck :)
[23:22:11] <nafta_> Velveeta: I DID IT!
[23:22:26] * nafta_ dances
[23:22:43] <nafta_> thanks a lot
[23:22:47] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[23:23:04] <nafta_> nowâ€¦I'll try to populate a select from mysql
[23:23:06] <nafta_> lol
[23:23:14] * nafta_ sees Velveeta run away
[23:24:26] <Betal> Velveeta: do you mean something like: $('#mydiv').load( 's.php', { 'f=' + $('#myinput').val() }); ??
[23:24:34] <Velveeta> nafta_: have fun w/ that :D
[23:24:50] <Velveeta> betal: without the object wrapper, pass it as a string literal
[23:26:09] <Betal> Velveeta: yeah, thanks again
[23:26:51] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[23:32:17] <Betal> Velveeta: if you can helpme again, why $(document).on('change', '#myInput', function() {...}) works, but $('#myInput').change( function() { ... }) don't ?
[23:33:11] <Velveeta> i don't know, i'd have to see a jsfiddle of what you're trying to do in those functions
[23:33:20] <Velveeta> and how you're actually invoking them
[23:33:52] <Betal> Velveeta: the ... is the thing you helped me before
[23:35:57] <Velveeta> it's still helpful to see an actual example of the code as it stands
[23:38:40] <sahbeewah> Betal, the first works because it's completely different to the second
[23:52:46] <Betal> Velveeta: idk how, but in jsfiddle it works ... http://jsfiddle.net/BdBZu/1/
[23:52:59] <Velveeta> i hear that often..
