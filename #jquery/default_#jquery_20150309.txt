[00:01:20] <Guest90588> scribblemaniac any code for this how can i change that
[00:35:52] <PCatinean> hey guys
[00:36:05] <PCatinean> Does anyone know a library that handles multiple select boxes and dependencies between them?
[00:37:08] <Bauer> hey guys, I am trying to use .each function here to iterate over each element and modify its string with some replacement strings, but I dont know how to save it back into element's value in line 12:
[00:37:09] <Bauer> http://jsfiddle.net/wtjm8ymh/
[00:47:57] <Cork> Bauer: elem.value.setData(newString); => elem.value = newString;
[00:48:06] <Cork> not sure where you got setData from
[00:48:28] <Cork> alternatively you can use $(elem).val(newString);
[00:48:46] <Cork> Bauer: also note you don't need i and elem in the loop
[00:48:51] <Bauer> Cork: autocomplete in Brackets :)
[00:48:55] <Cork> this will be the same as elem
[00:49:36] <Cork> Bauer: i very strongly doubt they've extended the string object
[00:49:44] <Cork> with setData
[00:51:27] <Bauer> yeah its not working with setData. BTW removing the i from parameters make elem take the i values and not the object.. so cant really remove the i
[00:51:50] <Cork> Bauer: you missed the point
[00:52:17] <Cork> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/wtjm8ymh/1/
[00:53:07] <Bauer> ahh, you meant remove them all together :) thanks Cork! as always hehe
[00:53:52] <wemini> im trying to create snippet previews for sites when users type them into posts, etc on my site. im using an OpenGraph library i found to help with sites that have specified OpenGraph meta data, but some sites don't have that.. yet - for these sites - facebook, etc are still able to generate a snippet preview. Does anyone know how that happens and whether I can do the same?
[01:04:59] <spliffy> does someone know a tool to display overlayed arrowd tooltips in multiple steps with the possibility for the user to advance to the next step? i want to create a simple help function for new users
[01:10:50] <Cork> spliffy: you most likely have to use two widgets for that (one for the tooltip and one for the "steps"
[01:20:34] <Omar-> good morning
[01:50:15] <PCatinean> Can someone help with jquery validator (which I've just discovered) how do I make a rule that all selects must have an option if the only option available is not empty ?
[02:07:18] <IamTrying> http://paste.ubuntu.com/10567222/  - How can i tell this Ajax query to do next crawl when the first one is done. Do not crawl like spam which is right now doing.
[02:08:12] <Cork> IamTrying: do the next one in the success callback
[02:08:28] <Cork> (move it inside the callback you already have)
[02:09:19] <IamTrying> Cork: you mean line 11 should go in 'success': function() { crawl();  } , .. ?
[02:09:20] <Cork> IamTrying: though you most likely want to use .always instead
[02:09:35] <Cork> so it doesn't break if the server returns a none 2xx/3xx response
[02:09:48] <IamTrying> OK
[02:09:53] <IamTrying> Thank you Cork
[02:16:00] <PCatinean> How does one attach a event to a field and read the value it send then act on it?
[02:16:17] <PCatinean> My task is to disable a select item once a input type text has been filled
[02:16:28] <PCatinean> and re-enable it once the input has at least a char in it
[02:16:41] <IamTrying> Guru Cork, can i do it like this http://paste.ubuntu.com/10567274/ ?
[02:16:44] <Cork> PCatinean: bind an input event on the field
[02:16:55] <PCatinean> I did use keypress and keydown
[02:16:57] <Cork> IamTrying: sure
[02:17:07] <PCatinean> I have to type in two letters for it to work
[02:17:07] <Cork> i would prob move the success callback to .done
[02:17:09] <Cork> for consistency
[02:17:23] <PCatinean> and the console.log displays no value on the event
[02:17:27] <Cork> PCatinean: keydown should work
[02:17:33] <IamTrying> OK - Excellent Cork
[02:17:34] <Cork> keypress isn't cross browser
[02:17:51] <PCatinean> ah yes I have to consider those as well
[02:18:04] <Cork> IamTrying: btw you can shorten the always line if you like
[02:18:09] <PCatinean> http://hastebin.com/qeyiyucaho.coffee
[02:18:11] <Cork> IamTrying: s1.always(crawl);
[02:18:15] <PCatinean> still displays none
[02:18:22] <PCatinean> when typing in a random char
[02:18:26] <IamTrying> OK - sure Cork
[02:18:37] <Cork> PCatinean: prop not attr
[02:18:47] <Cork> PCatinean: you almost never want to use .attr
[02:18:56] <PCatinean> :O
[02:19:00] <PCatinean> how come?
[02:19:04] <PCatinean> Saw this on stackoverflow idk
[02:19:28] <Cork> PCatinean: don't trust so
[02:19:31] <PCatinean> The problem is not prop or attr thought it's the fact that the console.log gives an empty value on the first keypress
[02:19:39] <PCatinean> Cork, I beleive you and I've changed it
[02:19:40] <Cork> it is almost as bad as w3schools.com
[02:19:49] <PCatinean> believe*
[02:20:06] <Cork> PCatinean: .attr checked both .getAttribute and the propertiy on the element
[02:20:17] <Cork> PCatinean: this changed in jquery 1.5
[02:20:25] <Cork> and so still haven't caught up to that
[02:20:48] <Cork> (so is about 3/4 wrong answers)
[02:20:50] <PCatinean> ok so I switched to prop and I trust it's the best option, still the problem remains that if I enter a char in the input it does not read the value in the event
[02:24:27] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jsfiddle.net/z44xxn0s/
[02:24:37] * PCatinean checks
[02:25:07] <PCatinean> wow how the hell did you make it so short?
[02:25:16] <Cork> :)
[02:25:17] <PCatinean> And also using some event which seems to be more stable
[02:25:22] <PCatinean> than keypress and checking values etc
[02:25:38] <PCatinean> damn man, it's like less than half of the lines
[02:26:15] <PCatinean> !! means null also as datatype and ignores 0 and empty strings?
[02:26:29] <Cork> !! means double not
[02:26:36] <PCatinean> which means true?
[02:26:42] <Cork> its a way to force the type to a boolean
[02:26:57] <Cork> ?eval "works?"
[02:26:57] <PCatinean> ah really? otherwise empty strings would have counted as value?
[02:27:02] <Cork> js> "works?"
[02:27:06] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:27:09] <Cork> ah
[02:27:14] <Cork> js> !!0
[02:27:25] <Cork> <_<
[02:27:27] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:27:35] <Cork> js> JSON.stringify(!!0)
[02:27:40] <Cork> js> JSON.stringify(!!1)
[02:27:46] <Cork> js> JSON.stringify(!!"")
[02:27:48] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:27:49] <PCatinean> wow that short liner is so cool
[02:27:53] <Cork> sigh
[02:27:53] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:27:56] * Cork kicks the bot
[02:27:58] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[02:28:13] <Cork> js> print(!!0)
[02:28:21] <b-ot> Cork: false
[02:28:25] <Cork> there we go
[02:28:28] <esko> Hi (again) :) I need to iterate over this response ( response = {"results": [{"links": [{"title": "some", "url": "thing"}]}, {}]}and push each title: url: to a new array
[02:28:44] <Cork> ?paste @ esko
[02:28:44] <b-ot> esko: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:28:54] <esko> my bad Cork
[02:29:08] <Cork> also make sure if the response you have is a string or an object
[02:29:11] <PCatinean> haha :))
[02:29:18] <esko> bad paste
[02:30:23] <PCatinean> Cork, another question, if I want to have a form validated in this manner: All select fields should have an option unless they are disabled/just one options with value "" and also if input fields are shown they should have a value before processing the form
[02:30:29] <PCatinean> What would be the best way to go about this
[02:30:30] <PCatinean> ?
[02:30:44] <PCatinean> I am asking because I see there are a lot more considerations than I thought
[02:31:08] <Cork> PCatinean: the best way is prob to use the jquery.validator
[02:31:22] <Cork> something i don't use much my self
[02:31:34] <Cork> with jquery selectors it is easy enough to do though
[02:32:21] <Cork> $('#form :input:not(:disabled)').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == ''; )
[02:33:02] <PCatinean> and that's a validating function?
[02:33:09] <Cork> it's a selector
[02:33:12] <PCatinean> validating/validator
[02:33:23] <Cork> the elements after the filter is invalid/error fields
[02:33:53] <Cork> you can do it with jquery.validator
[02:34:01] <Cork> but i don't use it enough to say how
[02:34:06] <PCatinean> never used it before in my life but here goes
[02:35:11] <Cork> PCatinean: i would guess at just setting the fields as required
[02:35:39] <PCatinean> that would be easiest to be honest since I have events all over the place
[02:35:56] <Cork> i meant for jquery.validator :)
[02:36:10] <Cork> but sure the native form validator can do it too
[02:37:01] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jqueryvalidation.org/required-method
[02:37:13] <PCatinean> ah so it's a non-standard library
[02:40:17] <esko> pehaps this will clarify things: http://jsfiddle.net/eskobaba/1utptynp/
[02:40:18] <esko> =)
[02:41:31] <Cork> heh except you forgot to include the response data :)
[02:41:41] <Cork> ah, wait sorry
[02:41:43] <Cork> didn't read
[02:43:18] <Cork> esko: why is links in an array?
[02:43:35] <Cork> or rather can there be more then results[0].links?
[02:44:26] <esko> Nope, i dunno why i get this, its a flask/mongo backend, i dont know why it returns links as an array, this is whats complicating my noob iterations =)
[02:52:38] <Cork> been having problems with echo in jsfiddle for a while
[02:52:41] <Cork> but this should work http://jsfiddle.net/1utptynp/5/
[02:53:01] <Cork> esko: your original code was broken cause it used data locally instead of from the echo service
[02:55:43] <Cork> ah, there we go
[02:55:48] <Cork> esko: http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:55:50] <Cork> bah
[02:55:57] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wnowu44x/
[02:56:51] <esko> excellent thank you Cork
[02:57:11] <Cork> ah now i see
[02:57:29] <esko> the future?
[02:57:57] <Cork> why there was problem with the first fiddle
[02:59:29] <paul_true> hi :) is there an event which i can trigger when i set manually a value? something like on('set') ?
[03:01:00] <Cork> paul_true: you can fire any "event" you want
[03:01:20] <Cork> if you want to trigger the normal event name you can too with .trigger()
[03:02:01] <PCatinean> Cork, would you suggest I use that third-party library for validation or try to do the code myself?
[03:03:56] <paul_true> yeah in now. but i need an event which i can call, but not the change-method from jquery
[03:05:03] <Cork> PCatinean: the validator plugin is commonly used (very commonly) so use it if you want
[03:05:18] <Cork> personally i find validation code so simple that i don't see why i would want the overhead
[03:05:19] <PCatinean> So it's pretty cross-browser compatible I guess then
[03:05:26] <Cork> yes
[03:06:03] <PCatinean> My validation would be done per data-type in input fields and value on selects
[03:06:09] <PCatinean> that's kinda it
[03:06:21] <Cork> PCatinean: have a look at the plugin if you like it
[03:06:28] <Cork> <_<
[03:06:30] <Cork> heh
[03:06:36] <Cork> PCatinean: have a look at the plugin if you like it
[03:06:50] <Cork> if you do use it, if you don't write it you're self
[03:06:54] <Cork> both should be simple enough
[03:30:18] <d3m0n> Is it possible to write a script where a user edits input fields that then changes the DOM of a loaded page on an iframe, then stores the whole page and it's entirety in a variable to send off?
[03:31:00] <Cork> d3m0n: why not just send the data with ajax?
[03:31:40] <Cork> sure sure, that is basically what wysiwyg editors are
[03:31:43] <Cork> *but sure
[03:32:26] <d3m0n> And when I say store the page I mean the every line from doctype to </html>
[03:32:31] <d3m0n> Possible, right?
[03:32:42] <Cork> not really
[03:33:19] <Cork> you could put the data in an iframe ans serialize it to a string
[03:33:31] <Cork> but it won't be exactly what you expect
[03:33:38] <PCatinean> Cork, should I look through all the select boxes on each change of any select and check the number of options and using that set them as required or not?
[03:33:38] <Cork> (for example the doctype will be missing)
[03:34:10] <Cork> PCatinean: no it is better if you can reduce it to only the one that matters
[03:34:49] <Cork> PCatinean: he code needs to be efficient as this run on every keypress
[03:34:58] <Cork> so be as restrictive to what you do as you can
[03:35:28] <PCatinean> hmm
[03:36:29] <PCatinean> So for the example of the custom input field when a certain option is picked I need to make the input field required.For this I would need to build a hash from this event and then pass it to the validator I gues
[03:36:32] <PCatinean> guess
[03:37:12] <d3m0n> Ok thanks Cork
[03:37:33] <Cork> PCatinean: simplest would prob be to just set .prop('required', true/false) on the element
[03:37:42] <Cork> PCatinean: i think validator catches those
[03:37:57] <PCatinean> ahhh really? that sounds nice!
[03:38:28] <Cork> PCatinean: required is part of the html form spec, and i think validator updated to look for them when the spec landed
[03:38:51] <Cork> at least it looks like it from the documentation
[03:41:58] <paul_true> hey. does anyone got some experience with jquerys "optionTree"?
[03:44:47] <PCatinean> hmm, doesn't work for some reason
[03:46:56] <PCatinean> no errors nothing
[03:49:31] <Cork> PCatinean: ya, looked again, and it doesn't look like it supports that (pitty)
[03:49:39] <PCatinean> ahh ok
[03:49:45] <PCatinean> Was testing now with required
[03:49:58] <PCatinean> Then I guess building the hash is the only way? or...
[03:50:27] <Cork> prob
[03:50:40] <Cork> but like i said, haven't used jquery.validator much so i might be wrong
[03:53:56] <Cork> ah
[03:53:58] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addClassRules/
[03:56:47] <cuppy> Why would flowtype.js resize once with correct settings, and then another time with the previous settings? https://jsfiddle.net/ecyhsaLL/1/ https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS/blob/master/flowtype.js
[03:57:47] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jsfiddle.net/fbwqbnk2/
[03:57:59] * PCatinean checks
[03:58:06] <Cork> opps
[03:58:12] <Cork> extra junk in there http://jsfiddle.net/fbwqbnk2/1/
[03:59:38] <PCatinean> hmm the thing is I already have a subset of classes I would need to add remove just this one
[04:02:32] <PCatinean> should I usee addClass and removeClass?
[04:04:05] <Cork> yes
[04:04:19] <Cork> or toggleClass('required', true/false)
[04:05:56] <PCatinean> ahh that's way better
[04:07:35] <PCatinean> does it need to be there to begin with
[04:09:23] <Cork> no
[04:09:58] <PCatinean> Is it better if I want to do two operations on a element to select it twice, store it in a var and apply to the var, or chain the operations?
[04:10:36] <PCatinean> I guess it's more readable with the var
[04:11:01] <Cork> PCatinean: store it or chain it
[04:11:09] <Cork> that is basically the same thing
[04:11:13] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/fbwqbnk2/2/
[04:11:31] * PCatinean looks
[04:12:37] <PCatinean> Yay I think it worked!
[04:15:57] <cuppy> Why would flowtype.js resize once with correct settings, and then another time with the previous settings? https://jsfiddle.net/ecyhsaLL/1/ https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS/blob/master/flowtype.js
[04:17:05] <Cork> cuppy: you would have to make a working example (you can link to external libraries under external resources
[04:17:07] <Cork> )
[04:17:45] <PCatinean> Not sure how to copy the css required for the example in jsfiddle
[04:17:53] <PCatinean> there's a whole lotta stuff in there and they are minified too
[04:19:14] <Cork> PCatinean: might not be needed
[04:19:24] <Cork> unless the styling is part of the question
[04:20:09] <PCatinean> Does not seem to work but...
[04:20:10] <PCatinean> http://jsfiddle.net/8a5ezL6r/
[04:20:14] <PCatinean> The js code is more important
[04:20:24] <PCatinean> Just wanted to make a checkup see if it's somewhat neat
[04:21:32] <Cork> PCatinean: select_elements.change <-- i would recommend to delegate this instead
[04:21:54] <PCatinean> what does that mean?
[04:22:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8a5ezL6r/1/
[04:22:44] <PCatinean> ah i thought that was it (from my jquery years way back) but what is the difference essentially?
[04:23:06] <Cork> PCatinean: it bind one event handler instead of one per select element
[04:23:12] <Cork> anyway gtg
[04:23:48] <PCatinean> thanks for everything Cork ;)
[04:30:03] <cuppy> Cork, I can't get a working example going because it's saying Refused to execute script from 'https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS/blob/master/flowtype.js' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
[04:30:07] <cuppy> https://jsfiddle.net/ecyhsaLL/4/
[04:40:09] <Cork> cuppy: use https://rawgit.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS/master/flowtype.js
[04:40:40] <Cork> the reason for the error is cause you load the github style html page instead of the raw file
[05:14:55] <cuppy> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/ecyhsaLL/5/
[05:17:52] <Cork> cuppy: i don't get any double resizing here
[05:17:58] <Cork> works just fine as far as i can see
[05:18:26] <Cork> though i would prob have done that with @media queries instead
[05:20:14] <cuppy> Cork, it's actually not running the flowtype file. See console
[05:21:02] <cuppy> Cork, or it is, but something is amiss
[06:39:19] <Omar-> any css expert here?
[06:39:31] <Omar-> #css is not helpful
[06:39:40] <Cork> ?ask
[06:39:40] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:39:45] <Omar-> haha
[06:39:47] <Omar-> ok Cork ;)
[06:39:50] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/s3s03yw0/
[06:40:00] <Omar-> how can make first two button (prev/next) side by side, 50% each.
[06:40:01] <Cork> you should know the rule by now >_>
[06:40:25] <Omar-> I wanted to wake the bot up, thats all ;)
[06:40:37] <Omar-> i'm using flexbox in the demo
[06:40:45] <PCatinean> :))
[06:40:47] * PCatinean giggles
[06:40:57] <Cork> Omar-: display: inline-block; width: 49%;
[06:41:10] <Omar-> Cork I tried it, didn't like it
[06:41:19] <Omar-> not giving expected results
[06:41:25] <Omar-> i want to keep it flexbox
[06:41:27] <Cork> that is about the best you can do without display: flex
[06:41:45] <Cork> oh, wait you're using flex
[06:41:50] <Omar-> the 3 checkboxes are working as expected
[06:42:00] <Omar-> yes, Cork, i'm already using flexbox
[06:46:14] <Cork> ugg haven't played enough with flexbox
[06:46:30] <Cork> Omar-: well to start with you need to change the 100% to 50% for navigation
[06:46:47] <Cork> next problem is with how to force where the linebreak should be
[06:46:56] <Cork> and that is where i don't know the answer
[06:47:12] <Cork> currently it aligns from the bottom up
[06:47:12] <randomguy> i'd say wrap the previous and next buttons in a flexible block, with a direction of column.  then that block surrounded in another for the others with a direction of row
[06:52:58] <Cork> ah, there we go
[06:53:56] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/s3s03yw0/1/
[06:54:05] <Cork> if you set 100% there is no way for it to fit
[06:54:17] <Cork> if you set 50% you leave no room for borders
[06:54:48] <Cork> so set a high enough number to force the 33% block to a new row but small enough to never cause border problems
[06:54:55] <Cork> and grow will do the rest
[07:04:02] <Dirkos> Im looking for a slideup keyboard
[07:04:13] <Dirkos> same as your phone is doing but just on a regular computer
[07:04:30] <Dirkos> Im using a simple html5 app on a touchscreen computer but i need a keyboard on it
[07:04:34] <Cork> and... now is this related to jquery?
[07:05:00] <Cork> you want to code it in a webpage with jquery?
[07:05:05] <Dirkos> yeah
[07:05:26] <Dirkos> I have some jquery plugins but the only good one i can find is not showing from the bottom
[07:05:54] <Cork> i'm suppriced you've found a complete plugin for onscreen keyboard at all
[07:06:01] <Cork> anyway so modify it to do what you want
[07:06:09] <Dirkos> http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/jQuery-Virtual-Keyboard-Plugin-Keyboard.html
[07:06:30] <Dirkos> but its not really working as i want it to do :) i found one but its not compatible anymore
[07:06:34] <Dirkos> but i will have a look
[07:50:48] <HumbugButler> Hey uhm guys I got a undef is not a function while I'm pretty sure it's defined. Would anyone mind taking a quick look ? http://dyls.be/cms/en/home/
[07:54:07] <randomguy> if it's on the $ then that would suggest jquery is not being included before you are trying to execute your code
[07:54:31] <Mosselmaniac> hi guys. I'm a bit lost. I'm using $.post(....) to post to an external URL. However, i get that common known error, Same Origin Policy. Normally you would fix that with PHP, setting header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); but I'm executing this post from javascript now. Is it possible and how could I do that?
[07:55:27] <sacho_> umm
[07:55:28] <HumbugButler> Which is interesting seeing as it's on the last file on the page and my other scripts are executing :/
[07:55:39] <sacho_> the same way - access-control-allow-origin is a header that the server sends in *response* to a request
[07:57:04] <Mosselmaniac> sacho_ i'm a bit lost now
[07:57:19] <sacho_> well then, consider reading about cors
[07:57:30] <Mosselmaniac> I did all day
[07:57:40] <Mosselmaniac> let me explain the setup, cause it's weird now.
[07:59:09] <Mosselmaniac> the current setup is: "Load HTML on domain A, with an iFrame to domain B". The iFrame loads a page, that page has a request to domain A again. Domain A parses the request and send the response. And somewhere there i have that CORS comming up.
[08:01:25] <neredsenvy> I have multiple checkboxes in the my HTML table defined like so: <input type="checkbox" value="something|something2|soemthing3" /> when I call $('#tbody_id input:checked').each(..); and put console.log($(this).val() or .attr('value')) I get 1 instead of something|...
[08:01:57] <mbrzuzy> do you only have one checkbox that is checked?
[08:02:08] <mbrzuzy> <input type="checkbox" checked />
[08:02:10] <neredsenvy> But when I put just console.log($(this)); I get the checkbox input object when I click on it in firebug and look at the properties of $(this) I see value as "something|..."
[08:02:24] <neredsenvy> No I checked more than one and that's not the problem
[08:02:41] <neredsenvy> The problem is that it finds all checked checkboxes but returns 1 instead of their value. : /
[08:03:43] <randomguy> can you put it into a fiddle?
[08:04:19] <neredsenvy> http://imgur.com/6wVXfkP
[08:04:43] <neredsenvy> ignore array [].. the first line "1" instead of "7.4.1-..."
[08:04:45] <sacho_> neredsenvy, if you want to get the attribute, use .attr()
[08:04:54] <sacho_> although that's really a misuse of the input element
[08:05:20] <neredsenvy> sacho_, -.- I know what to use to get value property of the element but the thing is it's converting value of my element to 1
[08:06:57] <DRSK> function setMode( mode ) { var modes = [ 'mode', 'mode2', 'mode3' ]; if( jQuery.inArray( mode, modes ) ) mode = modes[mode]; } <-- how could I combine that with an add/remove Class to only add the *mode* as active class and clear the rest? Basically if mode == mode, removeClass( 'mode2 mode3' ).addClass( 'mode' ) `
[08:07:38] <sacho_> neredsenvy, what jquery version are you using?
[08:07:39] <mbrzuzy> neredsenvy, the value of a checkbox is only ever 1 or 0
[08:07:41] <sacho_> neredsenvy, http://jsfiddle.net/3mk57h4k/1/
[08:08:06] <DRSK> $( '.thing' ).addClass( modes[mode] ).removeClass( modes.filter(mode) ); would something like that work?
[08:08:07] <mbrzuzy> checked, value = 1, not checked, value = 0
[08:08:50] <sacho_> checking a checkbox doesn't change its value property(the value property just isn't used on a checkbox). It does change the return value from .val()
[08:08:51] <mbrzuzy> Typically you would use the name to represent the 'value' in how you're thinking.  <input type="checkbox" name="sign_up_for_newsletter" />.
[08:09:02] <mbrzuzy> Then sign_up_for_newsletter would either be 1 or 0
[08:10:24] <neredsenvy> Hm odd it happens when I check the checkbox
[08:10:36] <neredsenvy> it turns it's value from "something|..." to "1"
[08:10:42] <neredsenvy> not a jquery issue
[08:10:59] <neredsenvy> blash
[08:11:03] <neredsenvy> found the problem
[08:28:57] <anli> Is there some way to get a list of css rules that will affect a certain element?
[08:29:52] <Cork> anli: open the element inspector in the browser
[08:29:57] <anli> Using script
[08:29:59] <Cork> and look at the rules list on the right
[08:30:01] <Cork> no
[08:30:14] <Cork> not in page script at least
[08:32:39] <Cork> anli: once uppon a time there was getMatchedCSSRules but it has been removed long sense
[08:32:56] <anli> Written in js?
[08:33:02] <Cork> a dom api
[08:33:50] <anli> Is it removed from all browsers?
[08:34:03] <Cork> it wasn't ever implemented in all browsers
[08:34:08] <anli> ok
[08:34:15] <Cork> and the one that has it has marked it for removal
[08:34:41] <Cork> https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/fd-QLCiLESQ/_mfowSsRR8oJ
[08:35:31] <Cork> so only option is to loop document.styleSheets
[08:36:14] <Cork> anli: but why would you need it?
[08:36:48] <anli> I seem to have the need of implementing a live css editor
[08:36:57] <Cork> O_o'
[08:36:59] <Cork> ouch
[08:37:02] <anli> ?
[08:40:24] <MalMen> hi
[08:40:44] <MalMen> https://jsfiddle.net/o9tej14o/ on this why the slider dont atatch to dialog ?
[08:41:29] <Cork> why would it?
[08:41:39] <Cork> the slider is outside it
[08:42:18] <MalMen> fuuuuuuuuck
[08:42:29] <MalMen> i messed up with the divs and dont notice it
[08:43:01] <Cork> MalMen: jsfiddle has the "tidyup" button at the top
[08:43:15] <Cork> i recommend using that if you aren't sure
[08:43:18] <Goldkiller> you have 2 buttons with the id "j_minimum"
[08:43:18] <Cork> it is quite good
[08:43:29] <Cork> ya, that too
[08:46:20] <meadhikari> Guys, I have file path as string like "file:///path" is it possible to upload the file to the server using ajax?
[08:46:35] <Cork> no
[08:46:48] <Cork> a page can't access local files
[08:47:04] <Cork> (with some exceptions if the files is a local file)
[08:47:46] <meadhikari> Cork, I think I am in the some exception zone, it is a phonegap application with the file path coming from the camera plugin
[08:47:49] <Cork> meadhikari: you can display the file picker and access the file that way
[08:48:12] <meadhikari> Cork, the file path is returned from the cordova phone plugin
[08:48:32] <Cork> meadhikari: you would have to get the data first
[08:48:43] <Cork> you could try an ajax call for the file://
[08:48:56] <Cork> as a blob call
[08:49:05] <Cork> i wouldn't bet on getting anything though
[08:49:54] <meadhikari> Cork, I am assigning the file path as src attribute to the image in the page and it is displaying properly
[08:50:01] <meadhikari> is there any way I can use that?
[08:50:06] <Cork> no
[08:50:57] <Cork> you could open the path in a canvas
[08:51:04] <Cork> and then generate a blob from that
[08:51:20] <Cork> ?mdn toBlob
[08:51:21] <b-ot> Cork: HTMLCanvasElement.toBlob() - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toBlob
[08:51:40] <Cork> but it might prevent you (just a heads up)
[08:52:10] <meadhikari> Cork, I have used base64 in the past but it did not work because of memory issue would using blob be similar?
[08:52:29] <Cork> meadhikari: blob is a data reference
[08:52:36] <Cork> it isn't a memory reference
[08:52:47] <Cork> (that is the difference between blob and bytearray)
[08:52:56] <meadhikari> okay thanks, will try that thanks a lot
[08:53:07] <Carlitta87> hey. anyone has any suggestions for a slider i can use as a popup that has html content like divs and text with images?
[08:53:13] <Cork> also base64 takes a lot more memory cause of the encoding
[08:53:41] <Cork> Carlitta87: from the context i guess you mean a slideshow and not a slider
[08:54:49] <Carlitta87> Cork : yes but i also need to have content. The idea is that this item should be a pop up with html content and still be slide to show other content
[08:55:21] <Cork> Carlitta87: ya, my point was slider is something like http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[08:55:32] <Cork> a big number of slideshows overload the word
[08:55:43] <Cork> and makes a mess out of everything
[08:56:18] <Carlitta87> Cork :  your right, i meant a slideshow not a slider
[08:57:03] <Cork> Carlitta87: ya, there are a ton of slideshows out there, most of them are junk :/
[09:00:14] <Jckf> jQuery Mobile question: I'm trying to create a control group with one text input followed by an icon button, but somehow only mess things up. Anyone have an example of this laying around?
[09:01:36] <Omar-> Jckf
[09:01:55] <Omar-> Jckf data-type="horizontal" and some css is involved
[09:02:44] <Jckf> I have data-type="horizontal" and "some CSS"
[09:03:09] <Omar-> http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/controlgroup/#Textinputs
[09:03:20] <Jckf> It looks okay when the control group is allowed to take up the entire width of the screen, but once they go inside a wrapper with padding, there is a line break before the button
[09:03:39] <Omar-> to be honest, I dont like the control group widget
[09:03:44] <Omar-> I prefer flexbox
[09:04:12] <Omar-> but the only issue about flexbox is, it's not supported by IE < 10
[09:04:25] <Omar-> http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox
[09:05:19] <Jckf> I'm doing this in a WebView on Android, so IE compatibility is not an issue
[09:07:57] <Omar-> then use flexbox
[09:08:08] <Omar-> show me your markup
[09:08:45] <Omar-> Jckf
[09:09:02] <Jckf> Omar-: http://pastie.org/10012368
[09:10:28] <IzaacJ> hey guys. any idea why the click event never fires on this code? clicking the span w/ class removeimage should trigger it AFAIK. http://pastebin.com/8AMVUMDH
[09:11:49] <IzaacJ> Just noticed a typo in the pastebin code, should say $(this).next(); on line 11
[09:21:00] <anli> How can alert($("html").parent().length); alert 1?
[09:21:33] <anli> Oh, its window
[09:21:43] <IzaacJ> Here is a cleaner code for my issue with triggering click on a span: http://pastebin.com/PZaRMFjX
[09:21:43] <anli> eh, document
[09:25:52] <Omar-> anli parent() is always one
[09:28:32] <anli> Not $("html").parent().parent().parent();
[09:28:42] <anli> I think thats outside "window"
[09:29:38] <Bloomberg> \/join #codeigniter
[09:30:10] <doug16k> IzaacJ, avoid .next
[09:30:41] <IzaacJ> doug16k then, what should I use? And that doesn't solve that the click never triggers
[09:34:54] <doug16k> IzaacJ, http://jsfiddle.net/2cg8bfqo/
[09:34:59] <meadhikari> Cork, any idea on how would i convert an image to canvas?
[09:35:19] <Cork> meadhikari: like i said, you can't
[09:35:24] <Cork> you can open it with open
[09:35:47] <meadhikari> what you mean by "open it with open"
[09:35:53] <doug16k> IzaacJ, that handler will work for newly created elements created after the handler is installed
[09:35:56] <Cork> ?mdn canvasElement.open
[09:35:57] <b-ot> Cork: Canvas API - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API
[09:36:23] <doug16k> IzaacJ, it handles lots of instances of things that can be deleted like that
[09:36:57] <IzaacJ> doug16k, okey, so the issue was that the containers were added after the document was ready?
[09:37:17] <doug16k> no, I totally changed how it traversed
[09:38:06] <Omar-> Jckf http://jsfiddle.net/fdz8ccyj/1/
[09:38:22] <Aoi> hm does "closest" always go "forward"? And always on the same hierarchy level only?
[09:38:30] <IzaacJ> doug16k: that was not the issue I had, and your code didn't solve my issue either. the click never fires on the .removeimage span element
[09:40:23] <doug16k> IzaacJ, fiddle works though
[09:40:25] <Aoi> oh I now see ... .next().next() is not beautiful especially if you have more elements at some point (or the order changes)
[09:40:25] <doug16k> I tested it
[09:40:36] <Carlitta87> Cork:  can i ask you how would i go about fixing so,ething if i sent you a link?
[09:40:38] <doug16k> yes .next and .prev are the worst way to traverse
[09:40:45] <doug16k> you touch the html at all, js falls apart
[09:40:46] <Aoi> sorry to barge in.. tested it, too @doug16k - works
[09:41:26] <meadhikari> Cork, I could not find the open() API method in the canvas element :( what am I missing please help
[09:41:27] <doug16k> .closest means, starting the test at the current element, go through the parents and find the first one that matches selector
[09:41:44] <doug16k> .find looks in descendents
[09:42:04] <doug16k> IzaacJ, ideally, that 'img' selector should be a class name selector and a class name should be on that image
[09:43:22] <doug16k> all that js "knows" is, the "whole thing" is in an element with class .image_preview, and you want to grab some src from an img there. wherever that click comes from, it will traverse through "that one"
[09:44:28] <doug16k> when you want to find a certain parent/ancestor, you probably want .closest
[09:46:10] <doug16k> as in: http://jsfiddle.net/2cg8bfqo/1/
[09:48:39] <IzaacJ> doug16k: I've added a classname to the img tag, and changed find('img') to find('image'), but it still won't fire for me.
[09:48:54] <doug16k> IzaacJ, needs . like: find('.image')
[09:48:57] <doug16k> it is a selector
[09:49:33] <doug16k> assuming <img class="image"
[09:51:13] <jomofcw> Hello !
[09:51:18] <arthurvr> Hey jomofcw!
[09:51:51] <IzaacJ> doug16k, sorry, forgot the . when I typed it out here. yeah, that's exactly as it it now. but the click never fires. ever. the image_preview is added through jquery as well and could exists multiple times. is that a part of the problem?
[09:52:12] <doug16k> the delete buttons have class name removeimage right?
[09:52:23] <IzaacJ> doug16k: yeah
[09:52:25] <jomofcw> Is there an easy way to get the correct "window.width" on a mobile ? $(window).width() gimme 330 on my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it seems to be more like 200 (because the element of "330" is out of the screen :/.
[09:52:41] <doug16k> IzaacJ, check f12 console
[09:53:08] <IzaacJ> doug16k: no errors, but no console log from that event handler either
[09:53:10] <doug16k> any error means it stopped execution there. don't expect anything to work at all if any errors happen
[09:54:16] <IzaacJ> doug16k: the only thing that I have in my jQuery that could cause issues is already wrapped in try..catch clauses
[09:55:54] <doug16k> dont try catch - just causes debugging grief and hides bug symptoms
[09:56:03] <Omar-> randomguy / Cork gor it fixed http://jsfiddle.net/s3s03yw0/4/
[09:56:29] <doug16k> actual legitimate uses of try catch are few and far between
[09:56:56] <IzaacJ> doug16k: there shouldn't be any issues in that code. has worked flawlessly for 2+ months. damn client required new functions a few days ago, which is why I have to add this shit
[09:57:00] <doug16k> you prevent errors by implementing correctly, not by "handling" everything
[09:57:04] <Cork> Omar-: uh, i gave you a fix about 2h ago...
[09:58:16] <doug16k> IzaacJ, the fiddle I gave should work no matter what. it handles ALL removeimage buttons in the whole document, period. are you using stopPropagation or returning false in other event handlers?
[09:58:35] <Aoi> guys so how come I did not find any jquery plugin, that would "draw" a dropdown box, that you could fill with any widget(s) you like? I currently am writing such a widget for jquery ui, but it felt weird doing this, because I cannot be the first one to want that o.o;
[09:58:54] <tasaif> IzaacJ: or are you using any libraries that might intercept the event
[09:58:58] <doug16k> IzaacJ, existing click handler might be causing a problem - it might be firing more click handlers than you think
[10:00:47] <randomguy> Aoi: you mean like a replacement for <select> for styling sake?  or something like a text area with auto complete as you type?
[10:00:51] <Omar-> Cork Yea, thanks! I saw it, it was breaking on small screen
[10:01:08] <doug16k> IzaacJ, are there any other click handlers? are they attached directly to things? do they return false or stopPropagation?
[10:01:10] <Omar-> i had to wrap buttons with another flexbox to make them act separately
[10:01:26] <Cork> should be possible without
[10:01:54] <Aoi> randomguy - I'd think something like a select element/widget, but instead of containing option elements, it could contain sliders, spinners, input boxes etc.
[10:03:06] <IzaacJ> doug16k: nope. here's the whole code: http://pastebin.com/jmeknWc9 only libraries that I've added is typeahead.addresspicker (which requires Google maps api library), and my code shouldn't conflict with any other code loaded by WordPress
[10:03:10] <tasaif> Aoi: are you familiar with bootstrap?
[10:03:28] <Aoi> hm I am afraid I am not (yet)
[10:04:09] <Aoi> http://divstar.no-ip.org/index.htm : this dropdown-like "box" is what I meant.. though I am sure I did not implement it in the smartest way possible..
[10:04:16] <Omar-> Cork i spoke too soon. It works in Chrome desktop but not Safari mobile
[10:04:19] <PCatinean> How does one write a jqueryvalidator method that checks the value of a input field if it's between 50 and 100?
[10:04:23] <IzaacJ> doug16k: the issue starts at line 150
[10:04:29] <tasaif> Aoi: I think what you want is already done in bootstrap
[10:04:51] <randomguy> 50 to 100 characters or the numerical values?
[10:05:35] <tasaif> Aoi: http://getbootstrap.com/
[10:05:50] <Cork> PCatinean: http://jqueryvalidation.org/number-method/
[10:06:13] <Cork> opps sorry wrong link
[10:06:23] <Cork> http://jqueryvalidation.org/range-method/
[10:07:57] <Aoi> hm bootstrap looks like a fully fledged framework .. I am not sure I need it all ... hm but thanks - I am taking a look at it!
[10:08:09] <tasaif> no worries
[10:08:19] <tasaif> you can include it and just use the things you want
[10:08:25] <tasaif> it's not intrusive
[10:09:23] <Omar-> Cork now it's perfect http://jsfiddle.net/62f25bwy/
[10:10:25] <tasaif> Aoi: this in particular http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns
[10:12:05] <Aoi> ah I see - and I could just fill-in widgets or something into the listitem-element? without having to worry on the container losing focus and possibly closing itself?
[10:13:30] <doug16k> IzaacJ, you dont need to try catch and console log error. that happens by itself
[10:13:33] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ maybe, but it's worth a shot before reinventing the wheel
[10:14:00] <doug16k> IzaacJ, do you really want it to continue after those catches?
[10:14:05] <Aoi> that's true :) thanks. on another note - is there some information on how and why use aria-* or data-* attributes?
[10:14:28] <doug16k> IzaacJ, imgage ?
[10:14:39] <IzaacJ> doug16k: yes, cause it's not a requirement that those textfields is there.
[10:14:43] <Aoi> I only remember aria-tags being used with JAWS software, but other than that ... :x no idea
[10:15:03] <doug16k> IzaacJ, then use an if statement. dont be cute with exceptions
[10:15:18] <doug16k> it causes debugging grief
[10:15:30] <doug16k> debugging/testing
[10:15:32] <tasaif> I've never used aria-* attributes
[10:15:43] <tasaif> I always stick relevant metadata in data-*
[10:16:10] <tasaif> s/relevant//
[10:16:15] <doug16k> how many of those console logs print from exceptions?
[10:16:17] <Aoi> hm it might sound like a stupid question D: but what does usually go into data?
[10:16:25] <tasaif> whatever you need
[10:17:03] <Aoi> ah so if I e.g. want to include a certain reference for a control inside a html-attribute, I'd go with data-somereference="value"?
[10:17:20] <tasaif> yes
[10:17:46] <Aoi> okay. thanks.
[10:17:47] <tasaif> if you wanted the reference to exist in the dom
[10:18:14] <Aoi> I'd do $('...').attr('data-*', 'value') :)
[10:18:33] <tasaif> $('…').data('*', 'value')
[10:18:44] <Aoi> ahh... haha nice!
[10:18:46] <IzaacJ> doug16k: I changed the try..catch to ifs. and corrected the typo, but still no luck :(
[10:19:01] <tasaif> then when you want to get the value, you can $('…').data('*')
[10:19:10] <Aoi> so this is how I add data there! I used select2 and could not think of a proper way to pre-fill it with data ..
[10:19:22] <dmsuperman> IzaacJ: "still no luck" meaning what?
[10:19:36] <dmsuperman> be specific when your'e debugging, "doesn't work" is meaningless
[10:19:43] <Aoi> anyway - many thanks tasaif!
[10:20:02] <tasaif> np
[10:21:41] <jomofcw> if there is two function bind on a click event, is there a way to avoid the second one from being executed, please ?
[10:21:51] <doug16k> IzaacJ, the js looks right. a sample of the html would help
[10:22:12] <doug16k> oh!
[10:22:18] <doug16k> I see line 139
[10:22:23] <ohcibi> is it possible to run a function after and before *all* tests for a qunit test module? as far as I can see in the docs there are only hookes for before- and afterEach
[10:22:55] <randomguy> jomofcw: if you want to avoid the situation you can use .unbind('click') before binding the second function
[10:24:41] <jomofcw> randomguy hello ! thanks for your answer. Yup, I was thinking about it... but :/... the one I want to avoid is the second one declared in the default JS of the webapp i'm using. The first one is the one in my custom template... and I search solution without editing the default file of the webapp :/.
[10:25:26] <doug16k> IzaacJ, don't put css in js. put that style crap on line 139 in the css in .image_preview or something :)
[10:25:27] <Carlitta87> Initally, when this page is loaded the slider loads to the wrong position. The problem is, i have no idea why or how to fix it. can anyone give some advice? http://dev.newmediastudios.net/asjames_web/frontend/
[10:25:49] <doug16k> IzaacJ, that whole thing should be using document fragment cloning
[10:25:53] <dmsuperman> jomofcw: check out http://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/
[10:25:59] <dmsuperman> don't unbind the other click handler
[10:26:01] <doug16k> and the html for it belongs in the html, .detach()'d out
[10:26:03] <dmsuperman> that's poor
[10:26:28] <dmsuperman> oh sorry I meant http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/
[10:26:47] <Zzaichik> How can I utilize $(this) in a conditional statement?
[10:26:48] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/7tnxkg6q/1/
[10:27:16] <doug16k> IzaacJ, I'll show example
[10:28:25] <jomofcw> thanks dmsuperman =)
[10:29:00] <randomguy> Zzaichik: http://jsfiddle.net/7tnxkg6q/3/
[10:30:43] <Zzaichik> randomguy:  thank you! I had tried each() but apparently didn't do it the correct way. :)
[10:30:55] <jomofcw> dmsuperman it work well, thanks !
[10:31:13] <randomguy> Zzaichik: your selector was incorrect.  it was missing the . for the class and wasn't finding any elements
[10:31:51] <randomguy> Zzaichik: so you may have had the each() right, but iterating over an empty result list
[10:34:04] <dmsuperman> jomofcw: perfect!
[10:34:09] <doug16k> IzaacJ, http://jsfiddle.net/2cg8bfqo/3/
[10:34:15] <IzaacJ> doug16k: thanks. JS ain't my thing, but it's similar enough to php and c# xD haha
[10:35:20] <doug16k> http://jsfiddle.net/2cg8bfqo/4/
[10:35:32] <doug16k> just fixed test case
[10:37:09] <doug16k> IzaacJ, there is only ever one image_preview in the html - it grabs it out of there at startup. then code conjures them up using a src in makeImage
[10:37:28] <doug16k> by cloning off the template
[10:37:44] <doug16k> then the html and css are in the html and css, and your js doesnt really care what it looks like
[10:38:22] <IzaacJ> doug16k: that's nice. any prefered location of where I should put it?
[10:39:12] <MalMen> https://jsfiddle.net/8w24bxpc/
[10:39:18] <MalMen> any good soul out there ? :)
[10:40:11] <dmsuperman> you spelled maximum wrong
[10:40:13] <dmsuperman> on line 15
[10:40:15] <dmsuperman> ;P
[10:40:25] <randomguy> boom
[10:40:28] <dmsuperman> also minimum
[10:40:30] <doug16k> IzaacJ, as long as line 2 of my fiddle runs before you call makeImage then it shouldnt matter much
[10:40:53] <doug16k> and use makeImage to generate an element and append those somewhere appropriate
[10:41:37] <MalMen> dmsuperman not even with it well speled
[10:41:44] <doug16k> IzaacJ, ideally, you want to pull that element out asap - or make it a child of a hidden div, so you never see it - it is purely for the js to grab
[10:41:56] <MalMen> NaN the same :7
[10:42:03] <doug16k> the image_preview html I mean
[10:42:06] <dmsuperman> debug the individual variables MalMen
[10:42:14] <MalMen> how?
[10:42:16] <dmsuperman> console.log them or use the debugger with a breakpoint
[10:42:22] <dmsuperman> in your dev tools
[10:42:29] <notchris> I need a workaround for selecting a selector via ID that has “example.asp” as the ID
[10:42:32] <notchris> I cannot change the ID
[10:42:41] <MalMen> the variables are setted
[10:42:44] <MalMen> i already checked that
[10:42:49] <randomguy> notchris: escape the . with \\
[10:42:51] <notchris> $(‘#example.asp’).hide(); does not work
[10:42:55] <dmsuperman> MalMen: well clearly not
[10:42:58] <notchris> randomguy: Really? hmmm
[10:43:10] <doug16k> notchris, $('#example\\.asp').hide()
[10:43:11] <dmsuperman> because 25 + 1 definitely doesn't return NaN
[10:43:25] <notchris> randomguy++ doug16k++
[10:43:37] <randomguy> i feel iterated, :o
[10:44:03] <doug16k> humans are so mutable
[10:44:22] <notchris> how so
[10:45:14] <doug16k> it's funny but you did change me - my path through time will change because you asked about troublesome css selector :D
[10:45:44] <doug16k> #jquery is messing with the timeline
[10:46:22] <dmsuperman> MalMen: http://jsfiddle.net/wdprrz73/
[10:46:44] <IzaacJ> doug16k: haha weird stuff :P anyhow, it's always nice to learn new things :D you just learned me of deattached html for use in jquery :D
[10:47:58] <IzaacJ> doug16k: AND VOILA ! It finally works ! Big thanks :D I'm really grateful.
[10:48:09] <doug16k> IzaacJ, np
[10:49:55] <IzaacJ> doug16k: now I'll just have to pass this knowledge onto a collegue of mine :P even thou he probably won't grasp any of it yet. I'm trying to learn him some basic html and php and slightly above basic css :P
[10:51:04] <IzaacJ> doug16k: thanks again ! now I'm off. been 2 hours since I was supposed to end my day :P haha
[10:54:08] <notchris> How can I remove all <table>’s from a page without removing the content inside
[10:54:31] <tasaif> http://wat.jpg.to
[10:55:54] <doug16k> notchris, convert every th,td's content into a div and throw away all the other elements and replace it with the document fragment
[10:56:02] <doug16k> notchris, I'll make example
[10:56:28] <notchris> doug16k: Thank you, I’m working with an antiquated ticketing system where I can only use js/jquery to change the pages
[10:56:58] <notchris> doug16k: By default, all content is stuck within tables, I’d like to break all of the content out of tables
[10:57:32] <dmsuperman> and put into what?
[10:58:07] <notchris> dmsuperman: I can deal with the content after it’s been removed from the tables
[10:58:55] <notchris> dmsuperman: But eventually into BS panels
[10:59:40] <dmsuperman> "remove" isn't the right word
[10:59:49] <dmsuperman> because if that's what you want, .remove() the table
[11:00:03] <tasaif> notchris: what about $('table').children().unwrap()
[11:00:05] <dmsuperman> it sounds like you want to *move*, not remove, and for that we would need to know what you want to do with it
[11:00:37] <notchris> I would like to strip table tags from all html content
[11:00:56] <hashpuppy> if you subscribe to the input event, is it necessary to subscribe to the change event?
[11:00:58] <notchris> tasaif: I’m trying this method now
[11:01:18] <dmsuperman> notchris: and *do what with them*?
[11:01:29] <dmsuperman> the contnets of those tags
[11:01:39] <notchris> dmsuperman: Leave them as is after tables have been stripped
[11:01:56] <dmsuperman> so you just want a dump of a ton of nodes one after another?
[11:02:07] <notchris> dmsuperman: Yes, exactly
[11:02:22] <notchris> tasaif: This almost worked, the content is still wrapped in TR and TBODY tags
[11:02:49] <notchris> dmsuperman: Even if I were to try to move the content, it would be near impossible considering the terrible setup of these pages
[11:03:02] <notchris> dmsuperman: However, I understand what you are saying
[11:03:56] <dmsuperman> so if you have <td>a</td><td>b</td> your expected output is "ab" ?
[11:04:01] <dmsuperman> how would that be helpful?
[11:05:52] <notchris> dmsuperman: Generally it would not, but the content being wrapped is aditionally wrapped by div’s with ID's
[11:06:20] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/ajLyfnL4/
[11:07:33] <notchris> dmsuperman: AHH
[11:08:20] <dmsuperman> you'd be better off just building your desired output during the extraction though
[11:08:25] <dmsuperman> instead of dump-and-then-format
[11:09:42] <doug16k> notchris, http://jsfiddle.net/x7aquxL9/3/
[11:10:14] <doug16k> notchris, look at the dom structure in the result
[11:10:15] <dmsuperman> doug your memory keeps shrinking!
[11:10:28] <notchris> Hmmm
[11:10:48] <arup_r> How can I write this code much better way ? It is a working code.,, but I want to refactor it -- https://jsfiddle.net/chzxx2nz/
[11:11:13] <doug16k> notchris, my implementation uses the actual dom elements and doesnt work with strings of html that clobber everything
[11:11:42] <notchris> Interesting, I’m checking both outputs
[11:11:51] <dmsuperman> and is also not what he wanted doug16k :P
[11:11:53] <notchris> Like I said, this system is terrible antiquated and the table structures vary
[11:11:56] <dmsuperman> arup_r: what's wrong with it? looks fine
[11:12:04] <doug16k> dmsuperman, what did he want?
[11:12:10] <doug16k> flat output?
[11:12:10] <dmsuperman> arup_r: don't aim for "clever" code. readable and maintainable is preferred
[11:12:23] <dmsuperman> literally to just dump the td's innards onto the page in order
[11:12:28] <notchris> doug16k: The content appears to duplicate infinitely
[11:12:30] <dmsuperman> no "faux" table
[11:13:00] <doug16k> notchris, you want flat list of elements? that's easy too...
[11:13:07] <dmsuperman> check my paste doug16k
[11:13:14] <notchris> I’m sorry, I was not as specific
[11:13:16] <dmsuperman> before you go writing another thing :P
[11:13:29] <notchris> I think dmsuperman corrected what I wanted
[11:13:34] <dmsuperman> you could get around the string by reading the nodes and text nodes
[11:13:41] <dmsuperman> but seems unnecessary
[11:13:54] <notchris> My first solution was to wipe all html
[11:14:01] <notchris> And then .load a new html file into the body
[11:14:07] <arup_r> dmsuperman: Ok.. I thought we could write it better way ..
[11:14:08] <notchris> But then I loose the generated links
[11:14:09] <arup_r> :)
[11:14:15] <notchris> And the functionallity
[11:14:24] <dmsuperman> arup_r: nope looks fine. it's fairly obvious what it's doing (which is good)
[11:14:31] <dmsuperman> you could prob shorten it up by it would be less readable
[11:15:00] <arup_r> dmsuperman: actually I am in JS pretty new.. I'm a Ruby programmer... so got the habbit :)
[11:15:37] <dmsuperman> we prefer good to clever over here in JS ;P
[11:17:00] <arup_r> ok ok :p
[11:17:22] <tasaif> so why not unwrap the rest?
[11:17:23] <arup_r> as per you the code I saw is acceptable.. :)
[11:17:28] <tasaif> notchris:
[11:17:35] <notchris> hey
[11:17:48] <tasaif> $('tbody').children().unwrap()
[11:17:56] <tasaif> $('tr').children().unwrap()
[11:18:39] <dmsuperman> that doesn't do what he wanted and it very finnicky
[11:18:52] <tasaif> ok
[11:19:07] <notchris> dmsuperman: Your solution almost worked!
[11:19:22] <notchris> I think I need to convert the tables to divs, and remove tbody, trs and tds
[11:19:50] <dmsuperman> my solution already dumps it into a div
[11:20:04] <dmsuperman> you could break it down to run only once per table so tehy each get their own div tho
[11:20:14] <dmsuperman> wrap the whole thing in $('table').each
[11:20:29] <notchris> Hmmm
[11:23:55] <notchris> dmsuperman: Hmm no luck with each
[11:24:24] <doug16k> notchris, http://jsfiddle.net/x7aquxL9/7/
[11:24:42] <doug16k> totally flattens table so it is as though everything related to the table vanished
[11:24:47] <notchris> Ahhh
[11:24:49] <doug16k> using the original dom elements again, no html
[11:25:55] <dmsuperman> so much code
[11:26:05] <doug16k> explodeTable isn't used
[11:26:48] <dmsuperman> oh ok I see. yeah that's pretty much what I was getting at with the each notchris
[11:26:49] <doug16k> explodeTable recreates table dom structure with divs
[11:26:51] <dmsuperman> in flattenTable
[11:27:22] <dmsuperman> though I think that needs a little more reworking doug16k
[11:27:26] <dmsuperman> try it with multiple tables
[11:27:31] <doug16k> nested?
[11:27:38] <dmsuperman> oh I dind't even think of that
[11:27:45] <doug16k> sure it isnt strict enough for nested
[11:27:54] <dmsuperman> honestly notchris I think you should give some examples of what you're aiming for
[11:27:57] <dmsuperman> this really sounds messy
[11:28:11] <doug16k> dmsuperman, yes it needs small changes to work on multiple tables at once
[11:28:17] <notchris> dmsuperman: This is what I’m dealing with: http://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/default.asp?interface=16
[11:28:20] <tasaif> notchris: something like this?
[11:28:20] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/85u1ct09/1/
[11:28:31] <doug16k> dmsuperman, I didnt mean it to be a jquery extension though
[11:28:36] <notchris> dmsuperman: This is a separate mockup I want to get it looking like eventually: http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/peo
[11:29:03] <doug16k> notchris, does it need to go do it on a bunch of tables at once?
[11:29:36] <notchris> If you look at the source code of the first link I posted, youll see that it does not abide by normal table structure
[11:30:13] <notchris> tasaif: That’s getting closer I think
[11:30:39] <dmsuperman> notchris: ok, yeah, you don't want to do the table dumping thing. you want to iterate over each of these cells and then build the new grid layout you envisioned that way
[11:30:42] <tasaif> what else is left?
[11:30:42] <tasaif> lol
[11:30:50] <notchris> dmsuperman: Hmmm
[11:31:04] <doug16k> notchris, that is what explodeTable does
[11:31:09] <dmsuperman> be explicit
[11:31:13] <doug16k> just style divtable divrow divcell
[11:31:36] <dmsuperman> nah not exactly doug16k
[11:31:40] <dmsuperman> he's trying to get a bootstrap layout
[11:31:42] <dmsuperman> there's no table
[11:32:01] <dmsuperman> or faux table even
[11:32:40] <doug16k> ah, so exactly what he asked for totally isn't what he wanted. ok
[11:32:48] <notchris> Yes, I’m sorry
[11:32:58] <notchris> I’m trying myself to understand how I want to approach this
[11:33:05] <doug16k> I guess I missed that part of chat. np
[11:33:15] <dmsuperman> it never came up I just inferred it by looking at his mockup
[11:33:15] <dmsuperman> hah
[11:33:28] <dmsuperman> notchris: why are you doing this in js? let's start there
[11:34:12] <surge> Hi everybody!
[11:34:12] <notchris> Because the system is so antiquated, the only workaround for customization is by using a hack to add JS
[11:34:29] <notchris> It does not support custom CSS or editing template html
[11:34:30] <notchris> Lol
[11:34:38] <dmsuperman> you could write a PHP script that fetches the remote page and then transforms it inline into what you expect
[11:34:51] <dmsuperman> using JS is oing to be messy and you'll have a weird flash on page load
[11:34:54] <dmsuperman> while it gets restyled
[11:34:56] <notchris> What I’m wondering is this
[11:35:04] <notchris> I was able to remove all html content
[11:35:06] <Guest55045> I'm interested in contributing to the jquery foundation with gsoc. Can one get me started?
[11:35:10] <notchris> and load that test page I made into the body
[11:35:23] <notchris> Which made the page look great, but I would have to reapply the functionallity
[11:35:41] <dmsuperman> right, you *can* do it in JS
[11:35:51] <tasaif> Guest55045: I think you're looking for the other channel
[11:35:52] <dmsuperman> but there will be an ugly flash while it shows the original layout and then buidls the new one
[11:35:55] <tasaif> jquery-dev or something
[11:36:05] <doug16k> notchris, it is probably less work to fix it right than force a fix into js. why can't you change the html?
[11:36:18] <LiENUS> so google hosts this jquiery-ui-i18n js file thats essentially a merged version of all of the datepicker i18n files, is this something google did themselves or is it available on jqueryui.com somewhere?
[11:36:29] <notchris> doug16k: Because I do not have access to the server hosting the system
[11:36:31] <arthurvr> Guest55045: Hey! I’m a team member, and I would love to get you started! Can we head over to #jquery-dev?
[11:36:35] <notchris> It is through a ticket company we are contracted with
[11:36:42] <dmsuperman> LiENUS: https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery-ui-i18n&oq=jquery-ui-i18n&aqs=chrome..69i57.3481j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8
[11:36:48] <dmsuperman> first result is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/tree/master/ui/i18n
[11:36:53] <dmsuperman> does that answer your question?
[11:36:55] <notchris> I was considering stripping styles and basically having an iframe on our main website
[11:37:03] <notchris> To make it appear like it was integrated
[11:37:12] <notchris> Which is a super terrible method
[11:37:23] <dmsuperman> notchris: ah, well let's stop right there. you can't modify the page in their iframe from your own site
[11:37:28] <LiENUS> dmsuperman, thats the separated ones the google one is merged, but its not just concatenated
[11:37:33] <notchris> dmsuperman: I realize that
[11:37:40] <dmsuperman> so how are you doing to do it
[11:37:43] <zejackal> if i want to select/specify an element that is nested within others, can I simply specify its local class?
[11:37:54] <notchris> I can inject javascript into the control panel of the ticket website
[11:37:55] <zejackal> like $('a.nav-subtitle')
[11:37:58] <notchris> And have it work on the pages
[11:37:59] <doug16k> notchris, you can proxy through your backend to get around iframe limitations
[11:38:10] <dmsuperman> I think you want to proxy and just do the transformation there
[11:38:16] <dmsuperman> in your backend language instead of JS
[11:38:21] <notchris> OK let me re-explain
[11:38:25] <tasaif> zejackal: that would select all anchor tags with the class nav-subtitle
[11:38:27] <notchris> We own example.com
[11:38:31] <notchris> And I manage the server
[11:38:43] <notchris> Our ticket site, which is not on our server, is tickets.example.com
[11:38:47] <notchris> IT runs on ASP
[11:39:16] <notchris> I can load scripts on the ticket site, that’s about it
[11:39:27] <notchris> Which has allowed me to change the styles
[11:39:27] <dmsuperman> right. so on example.com you would fetch the tickets.example.com page, transform it on your server
[11:39:31] <zejackal> tasaif: thanks. so if i want to grab a specific element when there are multiples of the same name, do i have to specify the complete path? or just a unique outer element?
[11:39:32] <dmsuperman> and then serve it up to your users
[11:39:36] <doug16k> notchris, so you have to scrape the ASP page?
[11:39:39] <notchris> dmsuperman: But will it maintain the functionallity
[11:39:58] <notchris> Like what if a user tries to buy a ticket
[11:40:10] <dmsuperman> oh, I see. No, it wouldn't
[11:40:26] <notchris> So which is why the iframe idea seemed decent
[11:40:33] <notchris> I could make it look like part of our site
[11:40:42] <tasaif> zejackal: unique outer element would work, but if the element has a unique attribute, you can use that as well
[11:40:46] <dmsuperman> it will flash the old style though every page
[11:40:49] <dmsuperman> which is an absolute mess
[11:40:59] <dmsuperman> I'd say you're better off just embedding their iframe and leaving it as is
[11:41:03] <doug16k> notchris, and they dont have a proper api to properly get data from it? badly designed asp
[11:41:13] <the8thbit|work> Is there a way to pass the value of a variable to a source function for jquery autocomplete?
[11:41:23] <notchris> I’m not sure, it has an API area, but I’m not sure if it is the same kind
[11:41:35] <notchris> Let me take a photo
[11:41:59] <doug16k> notchris, if there is an api way, that is what you want. you dont want to shim in some iframe replaement hack
[11:42:00] <the8thbit|work> ^Er, pass it at time of binding, not time of call
[11:42:56] <notchris> doug16k: There is an “API Integration” section on the control panel
[11:43:02] <notchris> But I’m not sure if it’s the same kind of thing
[11:43:09] <tasaif> zejackal: for example
[11:43:09] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/9no3b7xd/
[11:43:11] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, just call the callback with your variable
[11:43:32] <zejackal> cool, thanks tasaif
[11:44:00] <tasaif> np
[11:44:28] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, you have a custom autocomplete callback set up in your code?
[11:44:43] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: yes
[11:44:44] <doug16k> i.e. the "source" is a function, your callback function?
[11:45:05] <doug16k> ok, it has a parameter in that callback to call back into autocomplete with result, right?
[11:45:38] <the8thbit|work> $("#id").autocomplete({source: function(request, response) { /*ajax call*/ }}); is essentially what I have
[11:45:58] <doug16k> yes, so call response and pass the "variable"
[11:46:34] <doug16k> var xyz = ['a', 'b', 'c']; $("#id").autocomplete({source: function(request, response) { response(xyz); }});
[11:47:20] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: Ok, now how do I access it?
[11:47:26] <doug16k> access what
[11:47:33] <the8thbit|work> the value
[11:47:36] <doug16k> where
[11:48:01] <doug16k> what value, where?
[11:48:10] <zejackal> so if i'm trying to grab the text in the nested nav-subtitle here: http://jsfiddle.net/9no3b7xd/1/
[11:48:11] <doug16k> you mean, how do you tell what they picked?
[11:48:12] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: Er, I think you misunderstand. I am not trying to use this value as the response
[11:48:23] <zejackal> is that $('a.nav-subtitle')
[11:48:25] <zejackal> ?
[11:48:26] <the8thbit|work> I need to use this value as part of my ajax call
[11:48:36] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, use what value
[11:48:46] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: an ID value
[11:48:55] <doug16k> it is asking you for a list of autocomplete things
[11:49:04] <doug16k> oh!
[11:49:13] <doug16k> you mean, how do you put something like a product id on it?
[11:49:18] <the8thbit|work> Yes.
[11:49:27] <doug16k> ok, depends on the plugin
[11:49:33] <doug16k> exactly which one?
[11:49:47] <the8thbit|work> the normal autocomplete plugin that comes with ui
[11:50:35] <doug16k> you want an array of object, each with a "label" and "value" property
[11:50:42] <dmsuperman> zejackal: .second-level-cat a.nav-subtitle yeah
[11:50:46] <dmsuperman> if you want the nested one(s)
[11:51:00] <dmsuperman> hard to say, your example is confusing
[11:51:26] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, basically, one .map call
[11:51:38] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: http://pastebin.com/GTC5Up82
[11:51:48] <tasaif> zejackal: $(".second-level-cat a.nav-subtitle").data('name') ?
[11:52:26] <zejackal> what if i wanted to grab the href?
[11:53:05] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/9no3b7xd/2/
[11:53:29] <NoiseEee> http://api.jquery.com/attr/ @ zejackal
[11:53:48] <dmsuperman> zejackal: you would do it the same way you grab the href of any other element, with .prop
[11:54:15] <zejackal> nice, yeah i got this working. i definitely will read more jquery docs
[11:54:23] <zejackal> thanks guys
[11:54:39] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: remove that response(item_id) up there. That was me trying what you were telling me before I realized what you were trying to make me do
[11:55:40] <tasaif> dmsuperman: never use attr?
[11:56:04] <dmsuperman> use attr when you expect an attribute. attributes don't update as code changes DOM nodes though
[11:56:22] <dmsuperman> <a href="#foo"> href is an attribute here. document.createElement('a'); .href is a property
[11:56:27] <dmsuperman> the latter can change
[11:56:53] <tasaif> what's the difference between an attribute and a property?
[11:57:24] <dmsuperman> I just explained it :P
[11:57:34] <dmsuperman> jquery docs go more in depth if you prefer
[11:58:48] <tasaif> googling it's gashmoigan
[12:01:52] <tasaif> s/it's/its/
[12:14:50] <testerbit> How can I have the success return the data(PDF) in an iframe window as per the link at the bottom of pastbin?: http://pastebin.com/51SdGq25
[12:16:17] <dmsuperman> if you get the PDF in a data url (base64) you can set the iframe's src to that, I think
[12:17:30] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/eady3889/1/
[12:17:39] <dmsuperman> otherwise you'd need the URL to the pdf
[12:20:59] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, line 18 should be more like return { label: obj.SomethingLikeDescription, value: obj.ItemNumber };
[12:21:45] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, ah, I think I see...
[12:21:56] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: if I want a label and value, sure... but it works fine like this too
[12:22:09] <doug16k> yes I know what your problem is on line 18
[12:22:29] <doug16k> 'this' isn't the element?
[12:22:46] <doug16k> line 8 I mean
[12:22:59] <the8thbit|work> I tried $(this) and it didn't work
[12:23:04] <the8thbit|work> haven't tried just this
[12:23:16] <doug16k> ok, then you can fix it with .each...
[12:28:08] <testerbit> Also, data-id, is coming back undefined, would I need to wrap the function in a document.ready or is this causing the issue? http://pastebin.com/51SdGq25
[12:28:30] <prolificgnosis> I've a jsonP call that only executes the error function even though the status is 200 and the responseText is the expected json
[12:29:04] <prolificgnosis> this is probably a common mistake, but i can't find a solution via google explaining why this is happening
[12:30:23] <doug16k> prolificgnosis, jsonp response isn't json, it's js
[12:30:53] <prolificgnosis> doug16k: the contentType is applicatin/javascript
[12:31:06] <doug16k> prolificgnosis, jsonp = please send me a piece of js that calls a callback and pass the json as an argument
[12:31:24] <prolificgnosis> okay, just a sec
[12:32:25] <prolificgnosis> http://pastebin.com/bs4a0hUz
[12:33:32] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, can't edit code properly with that crap textarea but this should give you an idea http://pastebin.com/NVxrVBjB
[12:34:58] <doug16k> prolificgnosis, get rid of ?callback=jsonCallback in your url
[12:35:10] <doug16k> you are probably interfering with $.ajax's jsonp
[12:35:59] <doug16k> don't bother with jsonpCallback: 'jsonCallback',
[12:36:09] <doug16k> why bother? the $.ajax resolves like usual otherwise
[12:36:36] <doug16k> where's jsonCallback? nowhere right?
[12:37:21] <doug16k> textarea again? come on, use a code editor paste site, not a gigantic textarea POS
[12:38:20] <prolificgnosis> thanks doug16k, that works
[12:39:16] <prolificgnosis> how can I ensure that what I'm getting back is a jsonp response?
[12:39:30] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: that throws the error: TypeError: item.autocomplete is not a function
[12:40:29] <Es0teric> anyone here familiar with the wordpress media libary api in js?
[12:41:55] <prolificgnosis> nvm, removed dataType and it bombed out so it should be okay
[12:45:32] <dmsuperman> testerbit: don't use .attr('data-id') use .data('id')
[12:45:59] <testerbit> so: $(this).data('id') ?
[12:46:05] <dmsuperman> sure
[12:46:33] <testerbit> thanks
[12:47:22] <the8thbit|work> doug16k: Got it! I needed to add $() around all the thises
[12:47:25] <the8thbit|work> and items
[12:47:42] <kevireilly> testerbit: worth noting that they shouldn't be mixed either as `attr` wont update the `data` cache so you might set something with attr and wont see the change later with data
[12:47:55] <CorySimmons> how can i trigger the endCarousel event on this plugin? http://basilio.github.io/responsiveCarousel/#options
[12:47:57] * kevireilly found that out
[12:48:00] <testerbit> thanks
[12:49:01] <CorySimmons> I'm trying this http://pastie.org/10012785
[12:52:03] <doug16k> the8thbit|work, nice
[12:52:37] <doug16k> yeah I didnt think their plugin forgot to say which element :D
[12:52:52] <testerbit> Why does this not load the PDF into an iframe? It loads when I enter the url directly into the browser: http://pastebin.com/jYHKsYh0
[12:53:55] <NoiseEee> testerbit: thats not how you load documents in an iframe?
[12:54:06] <NoiseEee> you set an iframe's "src" property
[12:54:40] <TheSin> I'm sure this has been asked more then once I have been trying to google for it, but I am trying to output to a container like console.log, but it waits till the end to putput everything, is there no way to make it append in real time?
[12:55:13] <NoiseEee> TheSin: it depends on your code i guess?
[12:55:35] <testerbit> NoiseEee: replace this with iframe and then set src property?
[12:55:38] <NoiseEee> but yeah you can update anything at any time, providing an operation isn't blocking it / something is currently happening
[12:56:12] <NoiseEee> testerbit: put a "src" on the iframe, set the "src" to the document/pdf
[12:56:41] <CorySimmons> bump
[12:56:49] <TheSin> well that's the thing I want to see it happen, so as teh function runs I want the debug to be live, I have a function I call to append to the container, but I can't find a way to tell it to flush it out after
[12:57:08] <NoiseEee> TheSin: pastebin some code maybe
[12:57:19] <testerbit> NoiseEee: <iframe src=response></iframe>?
[12:57:25] <TheSin> NoiseEee, http://jsfiddle.net/xg8wx8e7/1/
[12:57:42] <NoiseEee> testerbit: i give up is the response the path to the pdf?
[12:57:47] <TheSin> it's a sample item of what I"m trying ot do
[12:58:24] <testerbit> NoiseEee: yes, I think the response would be the data received back.
[12:58:57] <NoiseEee> testerbit: well  if its something like "http://some.org/path/to/sample.pdf" it should work
[13:01:09] <NoiseEee> TheSin: the timeout/loop isn't doing a good job "faking".  see http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/.
[13:02:20] <TheSin> so my 2second timeout isn't working?
[13:02:36] <NoiseEee> TheSin: well its working, but its not like anything else is going to happen during that 2 second timeout
[13:02:47] <TheSin> right that is what I want
[13:02:59] <NoiseEee> you're just delaying the execution of y0our script by addToQueue.length * 2
[13:03:01] <TheSin> so my container shoudl up date every 2 seconds
[13:03:04] <NoiseEee> TheSin: no
[13:03:12] <NoiseEee> TheSin: read that article / about even timers
[13:03:14] <TheSin> but it doesn't it waits 12 seconds and updates everything
[13:03:17] <TheSin> k
[13:07:21] <TheSin> NoiseEee, doesnt' really help I can't use setTimeout or interval (I could in this demo, but when it's in practical use I can not) I'm trying ot simulate that env, where I can not have to processes running over each other, I need order, so if I use setInterval for 2s but the process takes 3 I can't have the next one start yet
[13:07:37] <TheSin> that is why I make a loop that was the same as calling an other funcion that was doing stuff
[13:08:02] <TheSin> that stupid loop is temp just to simulate other functions running
[13:08:03] <NoiseEee> use promises
[13:08:08] <NoiseEee> thats the quick answer
[13:08:18] <NoiseEee> when one thing is finished, start the other
[13:10:11] <TheSin> looking at it, thanks NoiseEee
[13:11:23] <CorySimmons> sweet useless irc
[13:14:05] <kingfisher64> could someone tell me how to make a iframe responsive with jquery http://www.benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/ is a css fix (although comments suggest it doesn't work easily).
[13:14:20] <kingfisher64> i'm looking for a autoheight feature
[13:15:00] <kingfisher64> it's going to be pulling in data from sites I don't have access to
[13:15:55] <testerbit> I created an iframe, wondering why its not loading image into the iframe? How can this be debugged?: http://pastebin.com/ZrNXMVvM
[13:16:52] <randomguy> testerbit: as said before, to place data in an iframe, you set the src and let it retrieve the page, not retrieve the data and place it in the iframe
[13:18:35] <dmsuperman> testerbit: is "resopnse" a valid data url like I said?
[13:19:32] <dmsuperman> oh, it's resopnding with a literal pdf. do what randomguy said
[13:19:50] <dmsuperman> I never understood the "ask question, receive answer, ignore it, repeat question" mentality
[13:21:00] <NoiseEee> testerbit: what is "response" ?
[13:21:05] <NoiseEee> testerbit: is it a URL?
[13:21:09] <testerbit> dmsuperman: It should be the actual pdf, not a url
[13:21:58] <NoiseEee> testerbit: thats not how things work
[13:22:18] <NoiseEee> its not like an image
[13:23:39] <testerbit> when I paste the url into a new browser window, it loads, how would you suggest I change this so it loads into a new iframe?
[13:24:02] <NoiseEee> use... the... url.... of... the.... pdf
[13:24:10] <NoiseEee> set... that... as... the.... iframe.... src
[13:24:17] <dmsuperman> testerbit: then why would you set it as the "src" ?
[13:26:33] <microhaxo> Is it possible for me to do something like this? $(rawHtml).each($('.idf-page')
[13:26:44] <microhaxo> seems to blow up when i do that.
[13:27:02] <randomguy> $(rawHtml).find('.idf-page').each(...)
[13:27:08] <testerbit> NoiseEee: like $('iframe').prop('src',url+data) ?
[13:27:46] <NoiseEee> testerbit: no, the URL man, you use the URL.  you cannot make a web browser display a PDF wihtou setting the URL/addressbar to a PDF.
[13:28:34] <randomguy> testerbit: an iframe is for all intensive purposes a browser window.  a separate browser window.  placing the url into a browser to see the pdf, is exactly what you do when putting that same url into the src property
[13:29:04] <dmsuperman> testerbit: to clear this up: stop using ajax
[13:29:09] <dmsuperman> it has nothing to do with what you want
[13:29:15] <dmsuperman> just set the src to the URL you want to display
[13:29:26] <dmsuperman> the one that works when you go directly to it
[13:29:36] <testerbit> dmsuperman: that does clear it up, I just don't want the pdf's to load until the user requests it via hover
[13:29:37] <microhaxo> Anyone? I have a chunk of html and i want to .each off of that raw html and find divs.
[13:29:47] <dmsuperman> testerbit: that's fine -- you can set the src on hover
[13:29:50] <dmsuperman> but still don't use ajax
[13:29:53] <randomguy> microhaxo: i responded to you micro
[13:29:59] <microhaxo> $(rawHtml).each($('.idf-page'), function (index, value) {... isn't working
[13:30:09] <microhaxo> oh thanks randomguy
[13:30:53] <_DB> if I want to past examples of a Object structure that I need to create where would I do it?
[13:31:22] <_DB> Id use jsfiddle but I need something with more room since its just to show the data object I need to create and the one I have currently
[13:31:34] <_DB> paste**
[13:32:02] <dmsuperman> more room? you realize if you keep pasting it will have a scrollbar right?
[13:33:35] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/Lshb665L/
[13:34:08] <_DB> my manager told me something about using .map
[13:34:22] <_DB> im pretty sure I could do it with a .each as well
[13:34:45] <dmsuperman> just return the correct data from yoru backend
[13:34:51] <dmsuperman> instead of some confusing transformation
[13:36:18] <_DB> not sure what you mean
[13:36:50] <dmsuperman> you want to transform the bottom response into the top right
[13:37:04] <dmsuperman> turn "11" into "a"
[13:37:09] <_DB> no
[13:37:20] <_DB> the top is Javascript
[13:37:21] <dmsuperman> please clarify what you want then
[13:37:25] <_DB> the bottom is a JSON return
[13:37:30] <dmsuperman> the bottom is not JSON
[13:38:27] <dmsuperman> anyway, ajax response on the bottom. got it. what's the question?
[13:38:57] <linux_daemon> hi guys, i have a question: i have multiple links that have the id : edit and and dinamically assigned classname. how can i, when i click the edit, the click function to alert the class of that link?
[13:39:07] <_DB>                 return Response::json(['dates'=>$dates]);  ??
[13:39:14] <dmsuperman> that isn't a question
[13:39:16] <_DB> thats how im sending that data back to my request
[13:39:25] <dmsuperman> we don't care what your backend looks like
[13:39:27] <dmsuperman> only the output
[13:39:35] <_DB> the output that i posted
[13:39:39] <_DB> on the jsfiddle
[13:39:41] <dmsuperman> ok. so again. what is the question?
[13:40:06] <randomguy> linux_daemon: they have the same id?
[13:40:08] <_DB> what functions can I use to create a structure liek the top one
[13:40:15] <_DB> with the values from my Json response
[13:40:22] <dmsuperman> how does the bottom map to the top?
[13:40:24] <linux_daemon> yes...
[13:40:29] <linux_daemon> but different class name
[13:40:31] <randomguy> linux_daemon: and to reference the classes you can do $(selector).attr('class')
[13:40:37] <dmsuperman> you need to explain it, we can't tell you
[13:41:05] <randomguy> linux_daemon: or prop instead of attr would probably be better
[13:41:22] <randomguy> linux_daemon: $(selector).prop('class')
[13:41:49] <_DB> im pretty sure I could just use a .each on my return to remove the number in the front and just get index's and values
[13:42:26] <linux_daemon> tried like that...didnt allert
[13:42:39] <randomguy> linux_daemon: how are you binding your action?
[13:42:51] <dmsuperman> _DB: I have no idea, because you haven't explained what you're trying to do
[13:42:51] <randomguy> linux_daemon: do you have a jsfiddle example?
[13:43:01] <dmsuperman> and each time I ask you to you respond with a non-answer
[13:43:22] <linux_daemon> just a secx
[13:43:25] <linux_daemon> sec*
[13:43:29] <_DB> im trying to create a Javascript object like the top one witht he data from the bottom one
[13:43:39] <_DB> if you look it has the same data inside of the {}
[13:43:50] <_DB> the same data form that is not values
[13:43:53] <dmsuperman> no it doesn't
[13:43:56] <dmsuperman> one has a and b
[13:43:58] <dmsuperman> the other has numbers
[13:43:59] <dmsuperman> so again
[13:44:02] <dmsuperman> how does one map to the other
[13:44:10] <_DB> the numbers dont matter
[13:44:17] <dmsuperman> sure they do
[13:44:20] <dmsuperman> they aren't the same
[13:44:26] <_DB> it says a is 11 and b is 12 that im using ids in this case
[13:44:33] <linux_daemon> http://jsbin.com/vixiburaxi/1/
[13:44:37] * dmsuperman shrugs
[13:44:47] <dmsuperman> _DB: you need to explain how one maps to the other if you want help
[13:44:58] <_DB> what do you mean by map?
[13:45:42] <dmsuperman> If I say "I have x and y, I want to get Z" that would make no sense right. I would have ato explain *how* z is calculated from x and y
[13:45:51] <dmsuperman> is it multiplication? subtraction? what
[13:46:11] <dmsuperman> so you have your input at the bottom, and your output at the top, and you want the code that transforms the bottom to the top
[13:46:14] <randomguy> linux_daemon: it's getting an undefined for jquery when i visit that page
[13:46:15] <dmsuperman> but you havn't explained how
[13:46:45] <linux_daemon> http://jsbin.com/vixiburaxi/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:46:52] <linux_daemon> there it is again
[13:46:57] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/Lshb665L/1/
[13:46:59] <_DB> better?
[13:47:54] <dmsuperman> ok, so there's no data transformation. why exactly is your ajax service returning data that isn't valid JSON?
[13:48:07] <dmsuperman> your response is invalid
[13:48:20] <dmsuperman> so I return to my original suggestion to just fix the output from your ajax service
[13:48:22] <linux_daemon> randomguy: try this one: http://jsfiddle.net/c64scunt/
[13:48:23] <dmsuperman> to output valid json
[13:48:35] <_DB> -_- its returning a object?
[13:48:54] <dmsuperman> _DB: http://jsfiddle.net/ceadbp6k/
[13:49:00] <dmsuperman> Notice how there's a syntax error in the console
[13:49:02] <dmsuperman> this is invalid JSON
[13:49:15] <dmsuperman> where is the 0: bit coming from?
[13:49:26] <dmsuperman> why are you listing a bunch of JSON objects?
[13:49:30] <dmsuperman> one on each line
[13:49:53] <testerbit> Why is the data-id coming back undefined? http://pastebin.com/HL0L3htn
[13:49:54] <_DB> uhh nvm ill figure it out
[13:49:58] <randomguy> linux_daemon: your inner selector, change it to $(this) instead of the id selector
[13:50:31] <dmsuperman> _DB: sure, I'd love it if you just did it yourself. You do realize your questions are always incredibly vague and poorly worded right?
[13:50:34] <dmsuperman> and you never supply enough details
[13:50:42] <dmsuperman> it's like trying to pull teeth with you
[13:50:55] <linux_daemon> nope, still the same...
[13:51:04] <_DB> aww you must be having a bad day
[13:51:11] <dmsuperman> I'm having a great day actually
[13:51:12] <_DB> do you want a lollipop?
[13:51:16] <dmsuperman> but this happens every time you ask questions
[13:51:19] <_DB> i bet.
[13:51:34] <_DB> not really
[13:51:34] <dmsuperman> your inability to ask a specific question has nothing to do with me or my day
[13:51:38] <dmsuperman> lol
[13:51:38] <dmsuperman> ok
[13:51:46] <_DB> perhaps you read to into is because robert manages to answer my questions in one go
[13:51:53] <randomguy> linux_daemon: http://jsfiddle.net/c64scunt/1/
[13:51:54] <dmsuperman> the simple ones, sure
[13:52:01] <_DB> nope
[13:52:03] <dmsuperman> ok
[13:52:05] <dmsuperman> go troll elsewhere
[13:52:11] <_DB> ive never not had a single question not ansered
[13:52:14] <randomguy> linux_daemon: your going to need to alter your html.  from a dom perspective only one element can have an id
[13:52:15] <dmsuperman> lol
[13:52:17] <dmsuperman> ok
[13:52:19] <dmsuperman> go away now
[13:52:25] <_DB> :P
[13:52:34] <linux_daemon> oh...well, that one works too :D
[13:52:37] <_DB> dmsuperman didnt get any last night huh?
[13:52:38] <randomguy> linux_daemon: to bind properly your either going to have to change all the ids to be unique, or give all of the elements you want to bind to a class
[13:52:47] <linux_daemon> i need to pass the 1 tor 2 to a post
[13:52:59] <dmsuperman> projection is cute _DB
[13:53:03] <randomguy> linux_daemon: or blanket bid to 'a' elements, which is most likely a bad idea
[13:53:05] <dmsuperman> but I'm done playing your childish game
[13:53:11] <randomguy> linux_daemon: bid = bind
[13:53:16] <_DB> ok
[13:53:19] <_DB> anything else?
[13:53:30] <linux_daemon> ok, thank you randomguy
[13:53:32] <linux_daemon> :)
[13:57:21] <testerbit> Why is the data-id coming back undefined? http://pastebin.com/HL0L3htn
[13:58:00] <dmsuperman> because data-id is empty
[13:58:08] <dmsuperman> on the element in question
[13:58:22] <dmsuperman> (or some code elsehwere overwrote it)
[13:58:24] <testerbit> I don't believe that is the case
[13:58:48] <testerbit> data-id="17583"
[13:58:55] <dmsuperman> well, it is ;) paste a fiddle please
[13:59:32] <ThePendulum> is this the channel about the fast, small feature-rich JavaScript library, which makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, eventhandling, animation and Ajax much simpler?
[13:59:32] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/b3prvjdg/
[13:59:59] <_DB> testerbit could be because youre doing it by class and its picking up the data-id from every class?
[14:00:11] <_DB> just a guess considering you say the data-id is set and what not
[14:00:34] <dmsuperman> "this" is specific to one element only in an event handler -- the element that the event was triggered on
[14:01:03] <_DB> you should post the html
[14:01:20] <_DB> yeah I know what this does
[14:01:59] <_DB> is it the only iframe on your page?
[14:02:12] <_DB> or the only iframe in that .file class?
[14:03:27] <the8thbit|work> ThePendulum: No, you're thinking of #mootools
[14:23:27] <_DB> woot woot got that mapping script working :D :D
[14:32:49] <microhaxo> Guys, when i wrap RAW html text in $(rawHTML) it strips away a ton of content
[14:32:53] <microhaxo> i lose like 20 divs
[14:34:48] <dmsuperman> microhaxo: fiddle? that doesn't sound right
[14:34:55] <microhaxo> before wrapping in $ http://paste2.org/WfbK3k4U  and After wrapping in $ http://paste2.org/FU9nWYZM
[14:34:58] <microhaxo> whats happening?
[14:35:21] <dmsuperman> I don't see any code here
[14:35:35] <microhaxo>  self.prepareAdditionalContent = function (rawHtml) {         var realHtml = $.parseHTML(rawHtml); }
[14:35:59] <randomguy> try just $(rawHtml)
[14:36:03] <dmsuperman> ok you didn't mention anything about parseHTML
[14:36:08] <microhaxo> rawhtml gets truncated majorly when i parseHTML or if i wrap it in any jquery selector, such as $(rawHtml)
[14:37:40] <microhaxo>  $(rawHtml).html()   ----> http://paste2.org/GIHXDC9L
[14:38:05] <dmsuperman> my first guess is that you have invalid HTML
[14:38:11] <dmsuperman> second guess would be logic error
[14:38:23] <randomguy> doesn't .html() get the inner html?  so you'd lose the outer container?
[14:38:36] <dmsuperman> that's also true
[14:38:55] <randomguy> do $(newOwnerSelector).append($(rawHtml));
[14:38:56] <microhaxo> $(realHtml).find('.idf-page')  returns 0 every time
[14:39:04] <randomguy> or $(rawHtml).appendTo(...)
[14:39:11] <microhaxo> and if you look at the rawhtml value, it contains it just fine
[14:40:28] <dmsuperman> microhaxo: please make a fiddle
[14:40:43] <dmsuperman> or at least use a paste service that doesn't suck :) pastie.org is nice
[14:45:31] <microhaxo> var realHtml = $('<div></div>').append($(rawHtml)); worked
[14:45:34] <microhaxo> thanks for the idea
[14:45:36] <microhaxo> weird behavior..
[14:45:51] <dmsuperman> definitely logic error then
[14:46:07] <dmsuperman> because $(rawHtml).find() will work whether its been appended to a div or not
[14:47:53] <microhaxo> dmsuperman, it returned zero every single time
[14:48:04] <dmsuperman> well right that's why I'm saying logic error
[14:48:09] <dmsuperman> you misunderstood something about your code
[14:48:13] <dmsuperman> or didn't paste what you were actually runnign
[14:48:15] <dmsuperman> something like that
[14:49:09] <randomguy> the html that your returning, is it all within a single element?  i ask because i'm curious what the result of .html() would be off of an object like "<div></div><div></div>".  i wonder if it would return only the inner html of the first child...
[14:49:31] <dmsuperman> yeah good point there too
[14:49:57] <dmsuperman> hard to tell with the poor formatting from the paste or the ability to select all the code and tidy it up
[14:51:23] <randomguy> well cats, almost 5 here.  going to run, :)  later
[14:51:48] <testerbit> Even this test does not load, how can I debug to see why this is not being triggered?: http://pastebin.com/2vKWHea3
[14:52:46] <dmsuperman> you have an element whose class is td ?
[14:53:10] <dmsuperman> with a data-id ?
[14:53:12] <dmsuperman> what's the HTML?
[14:53:25] <dmsuperman> also -- you're binding the events *after* the element is added to the page right?
[14:54:02] <testerbit> dmsuperman: no, that is probably my error, its just a <TD>
[14:54:15] <dmsuperman> $('.foo') is for finding elements with a class of foo
[14:54:22] <dmsuperman> $('bar') is for finding elements with a tag name of bar
[14:54:38] <dmsuperman> $('bar.foo') finds <bar class="foo">
[14:54:39] <dmsuperman> etc
[14:56:06] <testerbit> dmsuperman: I fixed it so its $('td'), but still nothing
[14:56:15] <testerbit> any ideas?
[14:56:16] <dmsuperman> and the second question I asked?
[14:57:44] <testerbit> the html is: <td style="color: green;' data-id="17583" data-name="...........>
[15:07:32] <dmsuperman> I meant theq uestion about the timing of your binding
[15:07:35] <dmsuperman> testerbit: ^
[15:07:56] <testerbit> I wrapped it in a document.ready, still nothing
[15:08:00] <dmsuperman> as I demonstrated, the code works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/b3prvjdg/
[15:08:03] <dmsuperman> so there's something else
[15:08:06] <dmsuperman> please make a fiddle of your problem
[15:08:42] <testerbit> ok
[15:09:02] <dmsuperman> oh, wait
[15:09:08] <dmsuperman> look at your HTML, it's invalid ;)
[15:09:16] <dmsuperman> you open style with a double and close it with a single
[15:09:51] <testerbit> I trunked it for the paste
[15:09:56] <testerbit> it closes with </td>
[15:10:08] <dmsuperman> the style attribute
[15:10:11] <dmsuperman> look at it
[15:10:46] <testerbit> its double in the actual HTML, just checked
[15:11:11] <dmsuperman> alright. fiddle please :)
[15:11:58] <testerbit> my html is a mako file,
[15:12:09] <dmsuperman> right, view source and use the generated html

[15:26:44] <Zzaichik> Oh. My. God. What's going on in here?
[15:36:49] <tasaif> top kek
[15:38:58] <tasaif> So single pages of information with scrollTos are just a fad right?
[15:39:06] <tasaif> along with infinite scrolling?
[15:42:15] <dmsuperman> life is just a fad
[15:50:37] <Omar-> hi
[15:56:01] <LindsayMac> Does anyone here have experience with pjax? I'm basically trying to reverse engineer some code and write some documentation for it and im a bit stuck on a few of the basics of pjax
[16:02:40] <dmsuperman> what's pjax LindsayMac
[16:03:43] <grodt> hi
[16:03:52] <LindsayMac> dmsuperman:  its basically a jquery plugin that combines ajax and pushState
[16:04:14] <LindsayMac> dmsuperman: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[16:04:46] <grodt> say I have a datepicker, and I have dates 9-15 selectable, and rest are disabled, is there a way to determine elements that are before or after elements, eg. the selectable ones? I need a message to pop up when you hover the disabled dates before the selectable ones, and a differ message on future disabled dates
[16:07:19] <LindsayMac> grodt:  i think you can get one element before a specific selector and then just get that one until there are no more
[16:08:08] <LindsayMac> grodt:  all you need to know about traversing the DOM http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[16:08:46] <LindsayMac> so you would get the .first() of the "active" dates and then from that you would get .prev() and get .last() of the active and get .next()
[16:08:59] <LindsayMac> I am just guessing.. i haven't ACTUALLY done it, but logically that is where I would start
[16:09:02] <LindsayMac> grodt: ^
[16:09:41] <grodt> LindsayMac, thanks macncheese
[16:09:52] <LindsayMac> :)
[16:11:20] <grodt> lol at israeli people even stealing indian peoples names
[16:11:49] <grodt> wrong channel
[16:15:19] <LindsayMac> derp
[16:18:25] <grodt> LindsayMac, does first only apply to selecting versus finding out wha the first element of that type is>?
[16:21:13] <LindsayMac> Does each element have a unique ID? Because i THINK that is what it could return..
[16:21:35] <LindsayMac> test it out.. do a console.log(.first(.active))
[16:21:37] <grodt> they have a "disabled" class
[16:22:13] <LindsayMac> If you're talking about dates I might set a data-attribute or an ID with the numerical date as well so that you can differentiate the blocks from each other as well..
[16:24:54] <Omar-> hmmmm
[16:35:15] <Omar-> nighty!
[16:36:07] <skift> can anyone recommend some good in-depth tutorials on jquery deferred?
[16:37:21] <tasaif> skift: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[16:40:13] <skift> thanks
[16:42:24] <doug16k> LindsayMac, use data attribute - don't put information in the id
[16:45:05] <LindsayMac> doug16k: thats kind of why I suggested both. I don't know anything about what his markup was or what flexibility he has
[16:45:59] <doug16k> oh you were answering someone else, sorry
[16:46:03] <LindsayMac> doug16k:  yea.
[16:46:22] <LindsayMac> doug16k: my question was regarding pjax and if anyone is familiar with it...if you're interested in trying to help someone out ;)
[17:13:13] <grodt> LindsayMac, im scared
[17:13:37] <LindsayMac> wut?
[17:25:23] <lambdumb> what's the proper way to use a jquery ajax call to load data from a json-encoded php array into spans on a page? as in, load them, then refresh them at an interval or if statement
[17:32:50] <grodt> LindsayMac, I get scared when I cant get it working you know
[17:33:34] <LindsayMac> No. I dont know
[17:33:54] <grodt> the thought of my client f'ing me
[17:36:11] <wontoner> lam dumb: do you have any code working yet?
[17:39:44] <LindsayMac> grodt:  matybe you should hire someone if you're in over your head
[17:39:59] <grodt> LindsayMac, ill hire you
[17:40:07] <LindsayMac> I'm booked.
[18:04:16] <testerbit> If I have a nested tag, should it selected using a transversal or can I select it directly?
[18:06:10] <tasaif> select it directly
[18:08:45] <tasaif> testerbit: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/mt475nsb/
[18:11:01] <tasaif> or this http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/mt475nsb/1/
[18:13:49] <testerbit> I'm trying to select a TD, so when hovered it adds a src to an iframe, but this TD gets refreshed every 3 seconds, is it likely its interfering with the selector?
[18:15:14] <tasaif> oh I see… you're the same guy who posted an html document into the chat
[18:15:43] <testerbit> unfortunately that is me, sorry about that
[18:16:57] <grodt> tasaif, calm down nikka
[18:17:01] <m_zr0> rofl doesn’t it suck when that happens?
[18:17:18] <tasaif> http://thats.racist.jpg.to
[18:18:03] <grodt> tasaif, haram zada
[18:18:03] <m_zr0> you’re all “hi, i have this one line of code” and next thing you know is a ton of scroll, got kicked, and everyone acts like it was your masterful plan
[18:18:32] <tasaif> testerbit: if you retrieve all of the information you need from the td in a single block, then you will have the data before the dom object is trashed
[18:20:39] <testerbit> tasaif: I'm trying to, now calling the class unique to those td's, but still does work, put a test console.log in there, but no response
[18:21:36] <testerbit> http://pastebin.com/iLxwzeww
[18:22:06] <tasaif> analyzed is the name of the td?
[18:22:11] <testerbit> even if the data('id') is invalid, one would think the console.log would work
[18:22:15] <testerbit> yes
[18:22:23] <tasaif> maybe bind to the parent instead
[18:22:25] <testerbit> analyzed is the class
[18:22:32] <tasaif> let me show you something
[18:25:06] <testerbit> Why would binding to parent work? In general how should one go about debugging Jquery?
[18:25:36] <tasaif> if you're binding to the td, then replacing that td with a different td, then you're losing your binding probably
[18:25:58] <tasaif> if you bind to the parent and filter by class, then you will affect all tds now and in the future
[18:26:04] <tasaif> or forever hold your piece
[18:26:11] <tasaif> peace
[18:26:13] <tasaif> peice
[18:28:47] <tasaif> testerbit: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/ntnpsvcz/
[18:32:23] <tasaif> in general you debug jquery with the debugger
[18:32:57] <tasaif> and the console
[18:33:13] <testerbit> so the parent is a tr which I tried binding to as per your example, but with no luck
[18:33:33] <tasaif> did you try changing "hover" to "mouseover"?
[18:35:27] <testerbit> tasaif: yes
[18:37:00] <tasaif> put your problem in a fiddle
[18:37:03] <tasaif> jsfiddle.net
[18:40:24] <testerbit> the strange thing is it seems to work in jsfiddle
[18:42:44] <testerbit> https://jsfiddle.net/bgvianyc/utvv3nck/
[18:43:09] <tasaif> yikes
[18:43:13] <tasaif> thats too much for me
[18:43:33] <testerbit> line 501 is the portion I'm trying to add
[18:43:44] <tasaif> in the future, please put as little code as necessary to demonstrate the problem
[18:44:03] <testerbit> weird thing is it works in jsfiddle,
[18:44:21] <tasaif> maybe something is intercepting the event
[18:44:30] <tasaif> and calling stopPropagation or returning false
[18:46:37] <testerbit> how can I find what is doing that?
[18:47:03] <tasaif> I'm not sure
[18:47:35] <tasaif> if possible, I would disable all other javascript libraries on the page
[18:50:40] <ismarkup> hello guys, I’m using this -> $.post( "workers/userRegister.php", $( ".createUserForm" ).serialize(),function(data){ } to pass some variables to a user register script…but I don’t understand why I’m getting all the data in the URL if I’m not using $.getJSON
[18:50:41] <ismarkup> *shrug
[18:50:46] <ismarkup> *
[18:50:54] <testerbit> do you think creating a button and selecting it instead is a viable workaround?
[18:51:26] <tasaif> only you can gauge that
[18:51:41] <tasaif> will it cause you problems in the future?
[18:51:52] <testerbit> problems in what sense?
[18:51:57] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[18:52:28] <tasaif> it's up to you to evaluate the solution
[18:52:53] <testerbit> Could trying to select using JS directly, work when Jquery fails?
[18:53:39] <tasaif> Are you sure the select is the problem?
[18:54:08] <tasaif> type $('tr') in the console and see what the return value is
[18:54:25] <tasaif> type $('tr .analyzed') in the console and see what the return value is
[18:55:07] <ismarkup> I mean..should I be getting the variables sent with serialize on php with $_GET instead of $_POST even if they are being sent thru $.post?
[18:56:14] <testerbit> tasaif: it returned the 5 <TD> lines with their respective data-name and data-id
[18:56:27] <tasaif> it sounds like the select is fine then
[18:57:57] <tasaif> ismarkup: i don't understand
[18:58:06] <testerbit> any chance wrapping in a (document)ready at the bottom of the file is causing problems?
[18:58:44] <tasaif> I donno, try it out
[19:38:26] <FFForever> Hey hey, I have an old jquery mobile 1.0.1 site. How can I disable the ajax posting on a form? I tried data-ajax="false" per the acient documentation, but that's not working.

[21:54:02] <jak2000> hi
[21:54:03] <dopie> hey guys
[21:54:05] <jak2000> dopie
[21:54:08] <jak2000> how are you?
[21:54:11] <dopie> for some reason my loop isnt working
[21:54:16] <dopie> jak2000, im a bit stressed
[21:54:17] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/twxfp2yy/
[21:54:24] <dopie> what am i doing wrong?
[21:54:32] <jak2000> i am not expert
[21:54:39] <dopie> im trying to loop over an array of text
[21:58:05] <scribblemaniac> your first issue is the === 4 which will always be false because y starts off at 0. You probably want y <= 4. Your second issue is with the fadein and fadeout functions, you must use the callback parameter to assure that the fade out finishes before changing the text and same with the fadein.
[21:58:21] <scribblemaniac> also you just crashed my browser :P
[22:14:05] <ifndefx> hi I'm using Fontawesome icons, and looking to stack the icons according to the documents but I can only find the fa-stack-1x class and nothing smaller. When I tried to alter the sizes I wasn't able to get it to be the right size. Has anyone tried anything that will make the stacked icons smaller ?
[22:34:26] <ifndefx> ok got it its working off the font size.
