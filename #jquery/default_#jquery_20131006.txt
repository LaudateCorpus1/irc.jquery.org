[00:07:19] <Hodds_> hey guys, I'm trying to work out why this submits more then once after its been run 3+ times... eg 1st submits once, 2nd submits once, 3rd submits twice, 4th submits 4 times and so on... http://pastebin.com/1Qzffd6S

[00:17:16] <adposition75> 1
[00:17:18] <mdev> jow can i specify which column

[00:17:42] <hyshai> Hodds_: the callback of the post is binding to the submit also
[00:17:51] <adposition75> 1
[00:17:52] <adposition75> 1
[00:17:59] <hyshai> Hodds_: and the original handler is still bound

[00:19:05] * hyshai is using irssi for the first time
[00:19:12] * adposition75 1
[00:20:17] <hyshai> Hodds_: so every post callback is adding an additional eventhandler
[00:20:24] <adposition75> 1
[00:20:39] <hyshai> Hodds_: you gotta unbind the unneeded handlers

[01:12:19] <adposition75> jphase: 1
[01:12:46] * jphase 's adposition75--; clearly didn't work or that'd say 0 ^
[01:12:54] * adposition75 1
[01:13:34] <dokma> jphase, I wanted to get an array with all data-uid values like $('inputs').data('uid') to return [2,3,4,5] instead of just the first one...
[01:13:41] <adposition75> 1
[01:14:10] <jphase> dokma: combine my selector with what Search112 said ^
[01:14:17] <adposition75> 1
[01:14:26] <jphase> except needs to add to a var
[01:14:33] <adposition75> 1
[01:15:00] <dokma> won't your selector select only inputs with a certain value?
[01:15:08] <adposition75> 1
[01:15:21] <jphase> dokma:   var uids = [];  $('[data-uid="value"]).each(function(){ uids.push($(this).data('uid')); });
[01:15:21] <dokma> jphase, ?
[01:15:24] <jphase> oh yeah
[01:15:30] <jphase> I misunderstood what you're trying to select
[01:15:41] <jphase> use whatever selector you want to grab the elements you need
[01:15:43] <dokma> yes, other than that that is what I did

[01:16:22] <dokma> it's just not logical to me that $('inputs').data('uid'); would not return an array with all of the data...
[01:16:40] <jphase> yeah teh map is prolly the way to go

[03:26:34] <adposition75> 1
[03:26:50] <ak5> hey everyone, if I get json and want to map that to html on the client, is there some goto lib for that functionality? I haven't done any client side templating so far
[03:26:57] <adposition75> 1
[03:27:03] <user101010> first accordion within first jquery tab works ok, but second accordion within second jquery tab not
[03:27:11] <adposition75> 1
[03:27:28] <user101010> It only works if no razor code within accordion
[03:27:36] <adposition75> 1
[03:27:38] <user101010> but if razor code within accordion then it does not work
[03:27:45] <adposition75> 1
[03:28:25] <user101010> the problem is that accordion is showing vertical scroll bar and does not adjust to its content height
[03:28:33] <adposition75> 1
[03:28:48] <user101010> below an example that works but without razor code inside. The same example with razor code is not woriking

[03:36:10] <thomas001> hello, is it garanteed, that you will also get mouseenter/mouseleave events on touch devies? (as there is no real moving pointer)
[03:36:17] <adposition75> 1
[03:36:47] <sammich> no
[03:36:54] <adposition75> 1
[03:37:00] <sammich> there's absolutely no guarantee
[03:37:07] <adposition75> 1
[03:37:14] <user101010> i have seen that height for accordion content when jquery tab is active is 0, so how to set the height to be different from zero from the jquery?
[03:37:17] <sammich> in fact, the only thing that really works is 'click' with a 300ms delay
[03:37:27] <adposition75> 1
[03:37:28] <adposition75> 1
[03:37:40] <thomas001> sammich, and the tap* events on recent mobile browsers?
[03:37:48] <adposition75> 1
[03:40:10] <sammich> thomas001: not sure what you were asking. Are you looking for the touch events or if the events of the same name get the same behaviour on touch devices?
[03:40:17] <adposition75> 1
[03:40:44] <ph88> which CSS should i load for jQuery UI + tabs ?
[03:40:52] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:06] <sammich> probably jquery-ui.css
[03:41:13] <ph88> right now i have //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/css/base/jquery-ui.css and //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/css/base/jquery.ui.all.min.css  maybe too much ??
[03:41:13] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:16] <thomas001> sammich, i want to know if my hover menu, would continue to work on touch devices ;)
[03:41:24] <sammich> thomas001: no
[03:41:32] <thomas001> sammich, why not?
[03:41:33] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:41] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:42] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:42] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:42] <sammich> what exactly is hover on a mobile device?
[03:41:50] <adposition75> 1
[03:41:56] <thomas001> mouseenter/mouseleave which seems to fire on tap
[03:42:01] <thomas001> at least on chrome/android
[03:42:10] <adposition75> 1
[03:42:11] <adposition75> 1
[03:42:49] <thomas001> i want to know if this behaviour is standard or just chrome spezific
[03:42:57] <adposition75> 1
[03:43:13] <sammich> just checking up on this
[03:43:20] <thomas001> thanks :)

[03:46:28] <sammich> have
[03:46:31] <sammich> a
[03:46:32] <sammich> theory
[03:46:35] <thomas001> hmm but css hover is not jquery .hover(), is it?

[03:47:10] <sammich> well, depends on how you look at it
[03:47:17] <sammich> but it's not the same thing, obviously

[03:48:32] <sammich> dam, my theory wasn't proven
[03:48:45] <gheraint> sammich, please don't copycat
[03:48:49] <Tingle> Could someone check out these 3 versions of a function I made and tell me which way is the best way to go about it. http://hastebin.com/seyaberuba.coffee, http://hastebin.com/potuwuliso.coffee, http://hastebin.com/xigabevuke.coffee
[03:49:06] <sammich> gheraint: Just seeing what it was doing
[03:50:27] <Tingle> basicly there are 2 questions in those functions, first - should I cache $(window) or just access it directly everytime I need it, and should I cache the body-section element globaly or inside the resize function?
[03:50:59] <thomas001> sammich, reading your link, thanks :)
[03:51:06] <LLckfan> I am trying to print a document made in Micsoft Office Word on the 3X5 index card. I have used tried both orientation. And caannot get it to print on a 3X5 index card. Could I have some advice on what I may be doing wrong?
[03:51:38] <sammich> LLckfan: first, you're in the wrong channel.
[03:51:47] <LLckfan> there is no right one
[03:51:54] <sammich> fine.
[03:52:01] <sammich> Is there a template for that size?
[03:52:18] <LLckfan> yes
[03:52:33] <sammich> and are you printing onto A4/whatever you use?
[03:52:43] <sammich> or does your printer take 3x5?
[03:53:41] <LLckfan> I am printing on the index card itself
[03:54:00] <sammich> does your printer take a 3x5 card?
[03:56:34] <gheraint> LLckfan, the answer to all your questions is to not post it all over the network, listen to people that do respond and get yourself unbanned from the channels that are most useful to you
[03:57:54] <gheraint> LLckfan, those bans were set in place because you have trouble listening and no trouble pasting the same message again and again
[04:00:33] <patchie> how do i check if i have selected a textbox? ...not click..but allready selected
[04:10:26] <t432> Following line displays [ object object], how do i get the value? this.search = function(item) {alert(item); };
[04:11:26] <t432> talk to me.
[04:14:44] <sammich> thanks for asking nicely
[04:15:47] <patchie> found out :)
[04:17:05] <Tingle> what is the difference inbetween var $window = $(window); and var window = $(window); ? why does the first statement have a $
[04:17:49] <sammich> Tingle: it's just a convention. You prefix jquery variables with the $
[04:18:01] <t432> Following line displays [ object object], how do i get the value? this.search = function(item) {alert(item); };
[04:18:07] <Tingle> oh ok
[04:18:16] <Tingle> didnt know $ is a valid varaible character
[04:18:28] <Tingle> variable*
[04:18:33] <sammich> how do you think $ works ;)
[04:18:47] <sammich> $(selector).find() etc
[04:19:13] <_rgn> but... it's jquery magic!!!
[04:19:25] <t432> anyone?
[04:20:57] <Tingle> I was wondering, would it be good practice to wrap every section of code, like where you want scoped variables into a function or $(window).load() for example...? for example I have this: http://hastebin.com/kobakigabo.javascript
[04:20:58] <_rgn> t432: the question is vague as hell
[04:21:19] <sammich> t432: you converted an object into a string, didn't you?
[04:21:30] <Tingle> considering I only need $bodySectionElement and $windowElement for that resize stuff.
[04:21:56] <_rgn> sammich: alert does that
[04:22:04] <t432> _rgn: I am trying to get a value through a  e.g. parameter function(event) <- how would i get a reference to this value?
[04:22:08] <sammich> yeah, alert converts it to a string
[04:22:19] <sammich> since it can only display strings
[04:22:32] <t432> alter(event) just prints out [object object]
[04:22:37] <sammich> t432: console.log(whatevervariable)
[04:22:52] <Tingle> someone?
[04:22:53] <sammich> and then check your console.
[04:23:38] <t432> samich: would that be event.whatevervariable give function(event)..
[04:23:46] <t432> given*
[04:24:11] <sammich> console.log will print out objects and present it all
[04:24:25] <sammich> so if you're not sure about the members of an object, just print out what you do know exists
[04:24:31] <sammich> so go console.log(event)
[04:25:24] <sammich> Tingle: you're pretty much asking if you should put things in closures
[04:25:49] <Tingle> yes, is that bad?
[04:25:57] <t432> sammich: following line just prints out [object object], what does that mean? this.search = function(event) {console.log(event);};
[04:26:10] <sammich> depends on what you're aiming for, but I personally don't do it unless it necessary
[04:26:22] <Tingle> due to GC?
[04:26:33] <sammich> closures are pretty fun structures though
[04:26:35] <T13|needsCoffee> console.info('varName contains: %o', varName); is what I use...
[04:26:59] <sammich> or you can just go console.log(varName)
[04:27:19] <sammich> or console.log(arguments)
[04:27:27] <sammich> or hell, just go debugger;
[04:28:06] <T13|needsCoffee> Yes sammich, I use a lot of logging at first, so I make it an info and prefix it to be sure it's the one I want.
[04:29:22] <sammich> yeah, I'm a little lazy. in any case, I clean up my console pretty soon after I finish debugging so I'm only left with the consoles for the current section of code at any given time
[04:30:27] <sammich> otherwise, I just click on the line number to see where it comes from. Don't get me wrong, I'll tag my console output when I have to, but generally when it's multiples lines at once
[04:30:34] <T13|needsCoffee> Yeah, I don't remove my consoles until I'm ready to call it stable for others to use.

[04:34:00] <Tingle> tx
[04:34:01] <Tingle> thx
[04:54:30] <t432> I'm getting undefined on line 48 - http://pastebin.com/FzuDDmY7
[04:56:44] <t432> anyone?
[04:59:48] <T13|needsCoffee> t432: get rid of the .query and see what you get.
[05:01:45] <t432> what line?
[05:01:45] <t432> oh
[05:02:43] <harvey203> http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/05/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/
[05:03:00] <t432> T13|needsCoffee: i get [object object]
[05:04:57] <T13|needsCoffee> Okay. Now put '%o', in front of your variable.
[05:05:35] <T13|needsCoffee> This will make your [Object object] clickable to see what is in it.
[05:08:20] <t432> T13|needsCoffee: i get [object object]
[05:08:34] <t432> sorry got disconnected
[05:09:13] <Tingle> sammich: so this is what I have now, I think its the most performant way to do something like this? http://hastebin.com/vujogaqiwu.coffee
[05:10:15] <geoffw8_> Hey all. I have a problem with bootstrap, every time i click my select dropdown inside of their nav dropdown, the nav dropdown closes
[05:10:31] <geoffw8_> I keep reading things on preventing propagation, but when I do the select tag just doesn't work : /
[05:10:54] <geoffw8_> I'm sure this is probably JS 101, but I can't get my head round it
[05:11:11] <geoffw8_> can anyone offer any wisdom?
[05:11:25] <T13|needsCoffee> t432: you should be able to click on that.
[05:11:36] <Tingle> sammich: basicly its to allow content to wrap inside the #body-section which has a max width of 1024 and min width of 558 for when you squish the window small/big and scale/zoom. So far I think js is the only way to handle such a behavior? Or can normal html/css do the same?. sorta like on wikipedia...
[05:12:12] <T13|needsCoffee> Css Tingle
[05:12:18] <Tingle> how?
[05:12:30] <t432> T13|needsCoffee: what i'm i looking for?
[05:13:13] <T13|needsCoffee> When you click t432 what do you see inside the object?
[05:14:01] <T13|needsCoffee> Tingle if you want it like Wikipedia does it... look at how they do it.
[05:14:39] <t432> i'll paste it
[05:14:42] <t432> 1 sec
[05:14:46] <T13|needsCoffee> Kk t432
[05:15:41] <Tingle> not exactly sure if what im doing is the exactly behavior. when you zoom in or squish the screen smaller than the element, I dont think it snaps the elements width to the window width? is that even possible with normal css?
[05:18:43] <t432> T13|needsCoffee: No option to paste but I see a list of menus and sub menus. First Menu label is currentTaget [object HTMLDocument]
[05:18:43] <t432> ...
[05:18:53] <t432> second label: data: undefined
[05:19:11] <T13|needsCoffee> Open those up and see what's inside
[05:20:02] <t432> hang on let me try another browser, see if one of them will allow me to copy
[05:20:23] <T13|needsCoffee> Now, how does that compare to what you "think" should be inside?
[05:21:49] <T13|needsCoffee> !api types
[05:21:49] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: No matches.
[05:21:57] <T13|needsCoffee> !api type
[05:21:57] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: No matches.
[05:22:29] <T13|needsCoffee> !api console
[05:22:30] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: No matches.
[05:31:53] <t432> T13|needsCoffee: not sure what you mean?
[05:38:22] <t432> T13|needsCoffee:: there?
[05:47:14] <T13|needsCoffee> t432: what is the variable suppose to be?
[05:47:54] <T13|needsCoffee> Is it suppose to be a number, string, array, object?
[05:48:59] <T13|needsCoffee> t432: what is the variable suppose to be?
[05:49:02] <T13|needsCoffee> Is it suppose to be a number, string, array, object?
[05:49:17] <t432> T13|needsCoffee:: string
[05:49:56] <T13|needsCoffee> Okay, then you need to see why it is an array or object at your console.
[05:50:58] <T13|needsCoffee> Add more consoles at every place the variable is changed up to that point and try to find it.
[05:51:00] <t432> T13|needsCoffee:: http://pastebin.com/LQkXrCgR
[05:52:55] <sammich> T13|needsCoffee: instead of serveral consoles, a debugger is also a good tool
[05:53:42] <T13|needsCoffee> It's hard for me to read your paste t432 on my little android screen.
[05:53:51] <t432> i see
[05:54:04] <T13|needsCoffee> sammich: can probably help you find it quicker.
[05:56:39] <t432> sammich: there?

[06:08:06] <sunbeam> the server its on is pretty ok in speed
[06:08:10] <sunbeam> any ways I can debug this?
[06:34:11] <t432> anyone awake?
[06:46:35] <patchie> i wanna change the width of a <td>, with greasemonkey on a site completly without id="" and class=""... a rather old site... i try to change the width of "vendros ref. no" from 100px to 150px: http://jsfiddle.net/L7wmG/
[07:24:23] <pulpfiction> besides checkboxes, what's the best user interface to let the user choose values based on a list of values?
[07:24:43] <T13|needsCoffee> Select?
[07:25:00] <mikunos> Hi guys I have 5 inputboxes with product quantity as value and product id within the class attribute. I need to send them to the php as array. How have I to do it?
[07:25:07] <T13|needsCoffee> select multiple?
[07:25:57] <pulpfiction> well, yeah, but on a huge list it can get not too easy to see the chosen values
[07:26:14] <pulpfiction> i was thinking on presenting 2 multiple selects, one with all the values and the other one with the selected ones... and letting the user double click the values to move them between the multiple selects
[07:26:40] <pulpfiction> i could also place 2 buttons with arrows between the selects so the user could use them too instead of the double click
[07:27:18] <pulpfiction> i'm wondering if this scheme has any defined name to google it around
[07:29:20] <pulpfiction> mikunos, use field[] as the field name
[07:30:07] <mikunos> ok pulpfiction name="field[]"
[07:30:46] <pulpfiction> mikunos, yes, $_POST['field'] will be an array
[07:31:18] <mikunos> good but how have I to get all the field from the page?
[07:32:51] <mikunos> $("input[name='field']") << ? pulpfiction
[07:33:35] <mikunos> $("input[name='field[]']")
[07:34:37] <pulpfiction> yes
[07:34:46] <pulpfiction> that's correct
[07:35:17] <mikunos> http://snipet.co.uk/Rb
[07:35:26] <mikunos> is it correct?
[07:35:36] <mikunos> I have tested but I get an error
[07:36:00] <mikunos> TypeError: 'stepUp' called on an object that does not implement interface HTMLInputElement.
[07:36:59] <pulpfiction> i don't see any stepUp on that code
[07:37:36] <pulpfiction> aren't you suppose to use data.val() on your qtd?
[07:38:47] <mikunos> data.val() returns only ine item
[07:38:51] <mikunos> one
[07:38:58] <mikunos> not all the items
[07:40:19] <pulpfiction> data is an array if you have more than one input named field[]
[07:41:07] <pulpfiction> you want to pass the size of array on qty? use data.length
[07:41:41] <mikunos> I would like to pass the id and value to my php file server
[07:42:14] <mikunos> array(array('id' => 123, 'value' => 2))
[07:44:11] <patchie> i wanna change the width of a <td>, with greasemonkey on a site completly without id="" and class=""... a rather old site... i try to change the width of "vendros ref. no" from 100px to 150px: http://jsfiddle.net/L7wmG/
[07:46:07] <mikunos> this is my script http://snipet.co.uk/5R
[07:46:34] <mikunos> any help?
[07:51:25] <krambiorix> hi, how can i make this work ? $("input").width($(this).parent().width());
[07:52:38] <mikunos> maybe I have solved the problem
[07:52:39] <mikunos> http://snipet.co.uk/6L
[07:52:59] <mikunos> but how to merge all the items and create only one post request?
[07:54:36] <krambiorix> anyone?
[07:57:17] <hxm> i have a keyup event which sends a POST trought ajax, it works nice but I want to set a delay for detect when the user ended typing
[08:00:24] <mikunos> solved in this way: http://snipet.co.uk/PJ
[08:00:39] <mikunos> if you have any suggestion to improve it ...
[08:02:22] <dabear_> hxm: do it in two steps. 1) on each keyup, register a timeout function with setTimeout() and cancel any other setTimeout calls. 2) Inside the settimeout function, use $(element).trigger("userEndedTyping")
[08:03:08] <dabear_> hxm: then you can just listen for the "userEndedTyping" event on the input element, and do the ajax there
[08:03:54] <dabear_> the setTimeout call should have a timeout of your choice, for example 500 milliseconds
[08:07:08] <dabear_> mikunos: you don't have to do $(data).each...
[08:07:29] <dabear_> mikunos: as data already is a jquery element, data.each... is fine
[08:07:35] <mikunos> solved in this way: http://snipet.co.uk/PJ
[08:08:08] <dabear_> mikunos: var input = []; //shorter
[08:08:31] <mikunos> ok
[08:08:35] <mikunos> done
[08:08:57] <dabear_> mikunos: you can also try to use data.map( function(){ return {"id": this.id, "value":this.value} }).get()
[08:09:17] <dabear_> not quite sure that will give you the correct format
[08:12:05] <mikunos> http://snipet.co.uk/Xp dabear_
[08:12:10] <mikunos> Works Thanks

[09:16:39] <RonWhoCares> I am trying to setup $( ".note_history_content" ).accordion(); as a class --- I am trying to use this within the context of a <table> where the accordion is one cell per row.  When the web page loads *all* the accordion's are open.  Is there a way to specify by default they are all closed?

[09:41:53] <RonWhoCares> I think it is with a new line in the js

[09:42:15] <RonWhoCares>  $( "#notes_container" ).accordion();

[10:10:04] <chrostophler> Hello #jquery. Ive made a group of sliders with jquery.ui.slider. It appears that when I remove the div.slider() element from the DOM, all the slider definition disappears, and the div reverts to being an empty div. Is that possible? normal? or should I look somewhere else for the solution?
[10:17:32] <chrostophler> Yeah, I have changed the code to hide the sliders, rather than detach them from the DOm, and they are fine... Seems odd... as the object refernences themselves dont change
[10:19:06] <serrano> hello, i have  a toggleClass script on a li-element, but its ignored because of another script that is using the li's parent UL.. is there a way to force the first script through?
[10:22:14] <chrostophler> ok, and event listeners are removed when an object is removed from the DOM too.. ok makes sense I suppose
[10:33:50] <xdjuj__> Hi :) Is there someone active here ?
[10:34:28] <xdjuj__> I'd like to know if there a way to do something like parent()*5 instead of an uggly thing like that parent().parent().parent().parent().parent()
[10:34:32] <xdjuj__> Thanx :)
[10:35:10] <xdjuj__> Got damned ! parentsUntil() is my answer :) Thx !
[10:43:03] <shoky> xdjuj_: see .closest() too
[10:49:20] <xdjuj__> shoky thanks
[10:49:24] <ooppa> How can I mod this http://pastebin.com/Sry3dv3a to reload the div after it has scrolled through content (line 543)?
[10:49:50] <xdjuj__> That's better than parentsUntil :)
[10:49:53] <xdjuj__> Thank you
[10:58:11] <xdjuj__> shoky, strangely, closest seemed not to work in Chrome/Safari
[10:58:19] <xdjuj__> Working fine in FF
[11:00:23] <plaster> hi
[11:01:40] <plaster> why i cannot get length for elements with the same id ?
[11:03:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is the data attribute supported in old html versions?
[11:03:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I keep reading it's an HTML5 attribute
[11:03:54] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but I need it in a XHTML 1 project
[11:05:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> or even if not supported, it will be ignored right? As long as jquery can read it?
[11:05:19] <xdjuj__> Guest62977 maybe because you can not have the same ID for 2 elements
[11:05:24] <Guest62977> why <div id="xx"></div><div id="xx"></div><div id="xx"></div><div id="xx"></div> jquery length return 1 if we write $("#xx").length;?
[11:05:34] <xdjuj__> Only one id, if you need many, you need to use classes
[11:05:50] <xdjuj__> You can't use ID
[11:05:54] <xdjuj__> Use classes
[11:06:11] <xdjuj__> <div class="xx"></div><div class="xx"></div><div class="xx">
[11:06:50] <An_Ony_Moose> I'm having problems with elements changing size after $(document).ready fires, in Safari and Chrome but not in Firefox. Could my use of a custom font face be causing this? If yes, how can I prevent it? If not, what else could it be?
[11:07:04] <An_Ony_Moose> (the elements' contents aren't changing)
[11:07:04] <Guest62977> xdjuj, i know this but i'm trying to clone li but i want to clone it for once
[11:07:18] <Guest62977> nad remove any repeated ids
[11:07:21] <Guest62977> ?
[11:09:36] <Guest62977> xdjuj__ i just want to make sure the coloning happens for once.
[11:10:42] <Guest62977> xdjuj__ you still there ?
[11:18:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If I have a string like this: some_separated_string_xxx_yyy - is it possible to change the word "separate" with "test" in 1 line of code?
[11:19:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I mean replace the x-th word
[11:21:46] <shoky> xdjuj_: i've never had closest not working.. it must be something else causing it
[11:21:55] <steeex> anyone know of a good jquery tutorial that really explains how to piece together javascript/ajax?
[11:22:34] <An_Ony_Moose> steeex: well what are you using server-side?
[11:24:35] <shoky> Guest62977: you can do .clone().removeAttr('id')
[11:25:19] <shoky> Guest62977: and if for some (bad & wrong) reason you want to really count the number of id="xx" elements, you can use $("[id=xx]").length
[11:26:44] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob: sure
[11:27:00] <jrajav> I have several sortables connected
[11:27:37] <jrajav> I'd like to intercept the correct event to intercept dragging an item from one sortable over another, check some logic, and then possibly cancel the "over" action
[11:27:51] <jrajav> So that a placeholder element will not appear
[11:28:17] <jrajav> Is 'over' the correct event to hook? Or 'change'? Or 'update'? And how do you cancel that placeholder appearing?
[11:28:31] <jrajav> (I already know how to stop the actual drop/receive from occurring)
[11:39:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what happens if you compare a string "null" with an actual null ?
[11:39:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> will it be true?
[11:39:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> "null" == null ?
[11:40:16] <jrajav> ecky--ptang-zoob: No
[11:40:20] <jrajav> Only the empty string is falsy
[11:40:37] <jrajav> Any other string is truthy so will not be == to null
[11:41:01] <jrajav> Actually, I don't think "" will be == either
[11:41:55] <jrajav> Null doesn't compare directly to other falsy values (though most falsy values will)
[11:42:10] <jrajav> http://zero.milosz.ca/
[11:55:31] <shesek> ecky--ptang-zoob, the only thing that null is == to is undefined
[11:55:38] <shesek> (and itself, obviously)
[12:15:53] <ggdevelop> hi, how can i print table header in every page in chrome, im using window.print and the table header shown only on the first page
[12:21:18] <hxm> how to wait 1000ms before than execute a keyup event?
[12:24:59] <uli1> hello. im trying to autoclick news page after document is ready. http://jsfiddle.net/76r3J/
[12:25:16] <uli1> the thing is that page keeps refreshing all the time
[12:25:20] <uli1> what im doing wrong?
[12:26:37] <uli1> heres how button looks which im trying to click: <a title="News" onclick="return checkSubmit(10);" href="javascript:clickMenu('news');">News</a>
[12:32:19] <uli1> anyone?
[12:33:37] <dabear_> uli1: you should never have javascript in the href attribute, and please don't use the onclick attribute in your html either.
[12:33:46] <dabear_> use jquery and .click() handler
[12:34:01] <uli1> i know. but i can't modify the page which has tas code.
[12:34:24] <uli1> that*
[12:34:28] <dabear_> javascript:clickmenu in your code is incorrect though
[12:34:35] <dabear_> remove the "javascript:"
[12:34:47] <dabear_> so this is a greasemonkey/userscript
[12:34:47] <uli1> i removed. same. page keeps refreshing
[12:34:55] <uli1> im looking for othet way how can i click that menu
[12:35:23] <dabear_> ?demo @ uli1
[12:35:23] <b-ot> uli1: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:35:24] <uli1> when i do live click seems ok. how can i do it with jquery
[12:35:39] <dabear_> $("#foo").click()
[12:35:50] <uli1> menu has no id either
[12:36:19] <dabear_> $("someKindaSelectorThatSelectsYourElementThen").click()
[12:36:20] <uli1> var btn0 = jQuery('a:contains("News")');
[12:36:20] <uli1> jQuery(btn0).click();
[12:36:25] <uli1> tried this but no luck
[12:37:29] <dabear_> does there exist an a element with a news text when the document is ready? e.g. are there any ajax calls that might have added that eleemtn some (very) short time after doc ready?
[12:38:06] <dabear_> and does alert(clickmenu) show something else than null ?
[12:38:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i do something like $("div").children()
[12:39:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> what type is returned
[12:39:27] <uli1> dabear_ shows null
[12:39:40] <dabear_> uli1: then that won't work at all
[12:40:04] <dabear_> you can't call a function that does not exist in the caller scope (eg. function is "null")
[12:40:12] <uli1> http://pastebin.com/ehx1HbaL
[12:40:18] <uli1> thats the function
[12:40:48] <dabear_> Rohan_Bhangui: a new jquery element with the children of the current div element(s).
[12:41:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhh
[12:41:10] <dabear_> uli1: you are waisting my time
[12:41:17] <uli1> sorry
[12:41:28] <dabear_> uli1: there is no wat for me to help you  with the limited information you have given
[12:41:28] <uli1> im just trying to solve the problem
[12:41:34] <dabear_> way
[12:42:13] <dabear_> show me a page and/or greasemonkeyscript/userscript that fails
[12:42:30] <dabear_> and point me to what you mean should happen

[14:05:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> antoher question
[14:05:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> say i wanted to select all children of a container div (not just direct) that contained content
[14:05:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> e
[14:05:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> eg
[14:05:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold let me make fiddle
[14:08:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> ryanneufeld: http://jsfiddle.net/vkuhf/
[14:08:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to be able to grab a divs content
[14:08:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> well the html
[14:08:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> such that if there is a div that is nested in the case of the nest ol
[14:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> the nested divs for ol
[14:09:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> i should be able to pick out the div which has direct children with <ol>
[14:09:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> and divs with text in them
[14:09:31] <ryanneufeld> Rohan_Bhangui: I don't follow
[14:09:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[14:09:41] <Rohan_Bhangui>  hold
[14:09:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/vkuhf/1/
[14:09:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wnat to select the divs with ids 'this'
[14:10:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> using the #container
[14:10:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> as a reference point without using #this to select those divs
[14:10:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> im building a sort of CMS
[14:10:37] <ryanneufeld> other than the fact that you can't use the same id more than once
[14:10:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i know that
[14:10:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> the 'this'
[14:10:55] <ryanneufeld> I'd suggest just adding classes to teh things you want to select
[14:10:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> was to make it easier for you to understand
[14:10:59] <ryanneufeld> and then selecting those
[14:11:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> well thats not relaly an option
[14:11:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> cuase my data is always changing
[14:11:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> *cause
[14:11:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> i want the jquery to handle all the selecting stuff
[14:11:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> the idea is
[14:11:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> that
[14:11:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> if i dblclick some text
[14:12:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> i should be able to edit jsut that text and nothing else
[14:12:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> that might make a bit more sense
[14:13:30] <ryanneufeld> adding a class will make that so much easier
[14:14:00] <ryanneufeld> at some point you're going to be generating the html, it's trivial to add the class you need then
[14:15:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats what im saying
[14:15:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> so is there any way to just make the cotent i dblclick on
[14:15:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> editable
[14:15:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> without classes
[14:15:41] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[14:15:54] <LoneSoldier728> for some reason :contains("texxt")
[14:16:11] <LoneSoldier728> does not work for me, keeps giving me a code 12 error invalid or illegal string specified
[14:16:15] <LoneSoldier728> anyone got a clue why?
[14:18:23] <YQw_> hi
[14:18:59] <YQw_> I need to crate a http request using javascript and I need to set certain cookie along with other headers. Can I do that with jquery ?
[14:22:48] <LindsayMac> I am in the home stretch of a hackathon for charity type thing. i need to take the data from an html input form and send it as JSON
[14:23:52] <LindsayMac> any help is MASSIVELY appreciated
[14:24:02] <LoneSoldier728> Do it as a POST?
[14:24:14] <LoneSoldier728> and send it over as JSON?
[14:24:18] <sammich> get the form, and iterate over it
[14:24:27] <sammich> stick name as the key, and value as value
[14:25:08] <LoneSoldier728> anything wrong with this statement
[14:25:09] <LoneSoldier728> $("center table tbody tr td:contains('51')").text())
[14:25:20] <LoneSoldier728> ignore the extra parenthesis
[14:25:43] <sammich> yes
[14:25:43] <ryanneufeld> Rohan_Bhangui: you can use content editable
[14:25:47] <sammich> it's expensive
[14:25:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know
[14:26:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> ryanneufeld: i need to be able to activate it only on dlbclick of the text
[14:26:29] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: you want to serialize the form, and then use JSON.stringify()
[14:26:59] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: then use that as your data value in (what I'm assuming you're using) ajax call
[14:27:00] <T13|needsCoffee> LoneSoldier728: why is your table inside a center?
[14:27:16] <ryanneufeld> Rohan_Bhangui: then you'd add the content editable attribute when it's double clicked on
[14:27:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[14:27:27] <sammich> a little center tag
[14:27:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i want tedit sepcfic parts
[14:27:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> particularly where a div contains text
[14:27:47] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  basically i need to take form data and  ultimately output it as JSON so that the node.js dev can work on a query
[14:27:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> directly text
[14:27:56] <LindsayMac> but yea., basically
[14:28:19] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: then what I suggested could work
[14:28:31] <LindsayMac> I know. I'm literally asking someone to donate some time to work on it
[14:28:47] <LindsayMac> i know thats not a NORMAL way of asking for help, but we are in the last hour of the hackathon and just need man power
[14:28:49] <LoneSoldier728> ok, can someone tell me how to select the first row on this page that has the channel 51
[14:28:54] <LoneSoldier728> http://www.dogstarradio.com/search_playlist.php?artist=&title=&channel=51&month=&date=&shour=&sampm=&stz=&ehour=&eampm=
[14:29:02] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: it's a few commands
[14:29:34] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i dont know how else I can say there's no time so we are literally looking for help
[14:29:47] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: formSerialzed=$(form).serialize(); formJSON=JSON.stringify(formSerialized);
[14:29:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> ryanneufeld: its complex ill figure it out
[14:29:58] <ryanneufeld> LindsayMac: oh, sorry
[14:30:14] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  i pretty much know how to do it, but i can't actually make time to
[14:30:28] <T13|needsCoffee> LoneSoldier728: why not $('td').contains('51'); ?
[14:31:04] <ryanneufeld> Ah, I'd help, but I'm busy making a light turn off an on through a website served by an arduino
[14:31:55] <T13|needsCoffee> LoneSoldier728: that isn't foolproof though if there is a time with 51.
[14:31:58] <LoneSoldier728> ok but it gives me back
[14:32:08] <LoneSoldier728> everything that has it
[14:32:38] <T13|needsCoffee> LoneSoldier728: why not $('td').contains('51').not(':'); ?
[14:33:05] <T13|needsCoffee> !api first
[14:33:05] <b-ot> T13|needsCoffee: .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[14:33:17] <T13|needsCoffee> Maybe LoneSoldier728
[14:33:34] <LindsayMac> ryanneufeld:  yea.. well.. ok . i saw a tutorial on that yesterday
[14:34:18] <LoneSoldier728> ya .not
[14:35:16] <LoneSoldier728> hm
[14:35:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> ryanneufeld: in a plugin when referncing the item to which the plugin is initialized to
[14:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> how do you select
[14:35:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> like
[14:35:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> if this refers to $("#container")
[14:35:59] <LoneSoldier728> T13 can u see if using the console
[14:36:07] <LoneSoldier728> you can select just that first row
[14:36:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> how do you select all the children (including grandchildren
[14:36:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> with id #foo
[14:36:25] <LoneSoldier728> because I keep getting an error trying to do it in a console
[14:36:38] <LoneSoldier728> and I am running a script thru node.js but it is returning all the elements
[14:39:51] <T13|needsCoffee> LoneSoldier728: I'm not on a computer, sorry.
[14:39:59] <LoneSoldier728> hm kk
[14:40:02] <LoneSoldier728> how do i select the 5th
[14:40:07] <LoneSoldier728> td then
[14:40:55] <T13|needsCoffee> Use .each() and pick the fifth one.
[14:41:26] <T13|needsCoffee> You'll have to create a global counter for it an make sure to increment as you go.
[14:49:41] <LoneSoldier728> how do i call it in the function tho
[14:53:04] <LoneSoldier728> damn
[14:56:50] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19214449/how-do-i-select-the-first-row-on-this-site-with-jquery
[14:56:59] <LoneSoldier728> if anyone can grab the first row
[14:57:58] <sammich> table tr:nth-child(4)
[14:58:39] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/Maq8g/2/ -- how does one copy the contents of the input and paste it into the textarea?
[15:04:35] <[1]LoneSoldier72> hm
[15:04:49] <[1]LoneSoldier72> that doesnt work
[15:07:17] <rigel> i'm using vertical tabs, sometimes >30, and i'd like to be able to go to the next tab without scrolling down. ideally i'd like the tab and the content panes to be separate, but i dont want to use icky frames
[15:08:00] <rigel> by scrolling i mean when i press the arrow key to go to the next tab it jumps down to that level to keep the tab in-screen, which sometimes means my content pane is no longer visible
[15:15:32] <boytoy> rigel: you mean like https://github.com/guidobouman/jquery-panelsnap ?
[15:15:42] <boytoy> heard some dudes mention it in #css the other day
[15:23:17] <rigel> boytoy: i'm not sure i want it to take time to snap
[15:49:01] <affine> hi everyone!
[17:55:16] <aphid> dontcha just hate it when you put a preceeding "." in the class in addClass() and you're like Y U NO WORK :/
[17:57:03] <jphase> hehe
[18:22:51] <tieTYT> why isn't this adding table rows and cells like I'd expect? http://jsfiddle.net/U9qPJ/
[18:28:28] <codepython777> anyone has a decent rating widget that will work with jquery/bootstrap?
[18:37:01] <ngharo> tieTYT: you have typos
[18:37:09] <ngharo> "</table"
[18:37:37] <tieTYT> you're right
[18:37:52] <tieTYT> ok check this update: http://jsfiddle.net/U9qPJ/2/
[18:38:13] <tieTYT> it seems to me that "var table" is actually "#foo"
[18:38:34] <tieTYT> which is not what I want.  How should I go about chaining append calls to the elements I've appended to?
[18:39:25] <ngharo> tieTYT: http://jsfiddle.net/U9qPJ/3/
[18:40:43] <tieTYT> works for me, thanks
[19:06:54] <Erneston> hello?
[19:13:11] <jphase> hi
[19:18:34] <Agamemnus> funny thing about $.css.
[19:18:54] <Agamemnus> and getComputedStyle.
[19:19:10] <Agamemnus> i guess it is because things like !important exist
[19:19:40] <Agamemnus> but getting a div's url when the element actually doesn't exist causes the browser (like FF) to try to search for it.
[19:19:50] <Agamemnus> (the image element)
[19:22:20] <aro> need some jquery magics
[19:22:45] <aro> im trying to loop over a javascript object, and create a ul element , but only the last list item is getting populated with data
[19:22:52] <aro> creating fiddle
[19:26:04] <aro> wtf is wrong with jsfiiddle
[19:27:41] <aro> nvm its choking on comments
[19:27:50] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/zJPvv/1/
[19:28:00] <aro> notice how it creates the list items, but only populates the last one with content
[19:29:28] <Agamemnus> (function () {}) () -> void function () {}, or function () {} ()... just btw
[19:29:46] <shoky> aro: because you keep re-using the same elements for $p and $span  in the loop
[19:30:07] <aro> so what do i need to do?
[19:30:09] <aro> redeclare it as var
[19:30:10] <aro> ?
[19:30:15] <shoky> aro: you're not creating new <p> and <span> in the loop, like you do for the <li>
[19:30:19] <shoky> no
[19:30:30] <shoky> you need to create a new element, with $('<p>')
[19:30:45] <aro> where? i am completely and hopelessly lost on this
[19:30:54] <aro> oh
[19:30:55] <shoky> just like you're doing for the $li
[19:30:55] <aro> i get it
[19:30:58] <aro> :)
[19:31:16] <aro> /facepalm
[19:31:17] <b-ot> aro: http://i1352.photobucket.com/albums/q641/Wolfkindcx/DoubleFacepalm2_zps6e8e47eb.jpg
[19:31:36] <aro> :)
[19:36:03] <Pinkamena_D> how can you use a descendent selector after other methods are used?
[19:36:37] <shoky> .find() ?
[19:36:58] <Pinkamena_D> oh ok...thanks.
[19:36:59] <shoky> donno what you mean
[19:37:04] <Pinkamena_D> yeah thats what i mean
[19:37:06] <Pinkamena_D> =P
[19:37:10] <shoky> k ;p
[19:50:51] <mdev> one of my favorite gifs :) http://i.imgur.com/6IPgZrz.gif
[19:51:05] <mdev> anyway jquery rocks, hopefully they have exciting stuff coming in new version
[19:51:12] <mdev> and they stop dropping support for older versions :P
[19:51:24] <mdev> does jquery have any issues on mobile that you guys know of?
[20:11:32] <aro> is there an easy way to 'select' a list item by using the arrow keys? i have already bound a listener for keypress and capturing the keycodes for it, i was just wondering how to jump to the next item
[20:11:57] <Erneston> can anyone tell me why my parallex scrolling works with jquery 1.7 but not 1.10
[20:17:04] <aro> ne1 know
[20:23:10] <jphase> aro: try something like $('select#yourselect option:selected').next().attr('selected', 'selected');   (for the next one)
[20:24:11] <aro> does it matter that there are nested elements in the list iteM?
[20:24:35] <aro> like: <li><p>Description<span class="stuff">102</span></p></li>
[20:24:53] <aro> its not a select element, its a list item
[20:29:57] <jphase> oh it's a list item, sorry
[20:30:02] <aro> yeah
[20:30:16] <jphase> well if that's the case, you'll probably want to add some sort of toggle class like "selected" or something
[20:30:53] <jphase> in which case you could then do something like $('ul#yourul li.selected').toggleClass('selected').next().addClass('selected');
[20:31:00] <jphase> something along those lines anyhow
[20:31:21] <jphase> and no, it doesn't matter, .selected in that selector will grab any class="selected" within the entire ul
[20:32:26] <aro> ok
[20:32:26] <aro> cool
[20:33:54] <raptorsystems> just checking, jquery hasn't implemented filereader yet?
[20:42:02] <jeremy-> Hello, there are some resize / crop features that would be useful in this already made jquery resize & crop API (https://github.com/trepmag/jrac), however, I've identified that some of the jquery ui components like the 'slider' no longer work. Its built on jquery 1.6.1 and jquery UI 1.8.13. Any ideas why this feature stopped working but doesnt pipe an error
[21:05:37] <jphase> jeremy-: not sure exactly, but a lot has changed since 1.6.1. Are there other solutions you can use? If not, are there any errors in your console?
[21:07:29] <jeremy-> Ahh thanks for looking into it, I ended up finding the issue after a while
[21:07:51] <jeremy-> 2 things, he removed the resize component  ( a feature), for some reason, and I was also missing some stylesheets
[21:08:05] <jeremy-> I reverted to a previous version and I've fixed most of what i need
[21:14:23] <jphase> oh nice
[21:53:46] <kennymeyers> Hi! My jquery ui buttons keep adding nesting more span.ui-button-text on subsequent calls even though the container context is different. Has anyone run into this issue?
[21:55:23] <shaya> kennymeyers: is it bound to an event on a parent (of container) element?
[21:56:04] <kennymeyers> shaya: The button call is when a tooltips content is rendered
[21:56:08] <kennymeyers> *buttonset()
[21:56:33] <kennymeyers> It works correctly in the new tooltip (rendered via ajax) but doubles up on the already rendered tooltips
[21:57:09] <kennymeyers> and it's only the span.ui-button-text elements nesting
[21:57:50] <shaya> kennymeyers: hard to tell w/o code, but it sounds like the event handler is getting called again (bubbling?)
[21:58:44] <shaya> kennymeyers: try adding  event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropogation()
[22:02:43] <FarrukhShoaib> i got a messed-up code developed by multiple developers, some parts are using jQuery and some parts are using the $ sign. If i use noConflict some parts work while some stop, and if I remove if some other parts start working. so any suggestions how I can use both the $ alias and jQuery
[22:04:00] <shaya> FarrukhShoaib: jQuery.noConflict() allows you to use both $ and jQuery
[22:04:45] <shaya> FarrukhShoaib: you have to be sure jQuery.noConflict is called after all instnaces of jQuery.js
[22:05:09] <shaya> FarrukhShoaib: AND prior to all scripts that are using jQuery
[22:06:11] <shaya> FarrukhShoaib: you only have to call it once, but it must be after jQuery is instantiated prior to use of jQuery
[22:06:31] <FarrukhShoaib> ok
[22:07:02] <Libin> I have got a quick question. How can i stop a get request that happens on a page load
[22:07:40] <Libin> its getting the model from the server and validating the fields on page load
[22:08:33] <Libin> helo
[22:09:33] <Libin> anyone in here
[22:09:34] <shaya> Libin: i dont understand your q
[22:09:52] <shaya> Libin: please expound a bit more
[22:10:29] <Libin> I have got a form in a page, which consists on few text fields, email field and a date picker
[22:11:02] <Libin> The problem i have is that the form is get validated right on the page load
[22:11:16] <shaya> Libin: ok, why are stopping the get?
[22:11:52] <Libin> the text fields are ok, but the email field shows an error becuase , it has a placeholder called "email" and obiviously its not an valid email address
[22:12:07] <Libin> so i want to stop that intial validation
[22:12:12] <shaya> Libin: first of all, you shouldn;t be using GET to validate a form (semantically, at the very least)
[22:12:25] <Libin> the validation should happen only on the "post" of the form
[22:12:35] <shaya> Libin: but that's besides the point
[22:12:46] <Libin> i dont have a get request
[22:13:08] <Libin> even at the server i only have a post method
[22:13:45] <shaya> Libin: your question was "how do i stop a get method", wut?
[22:52:45] <thom_> hello>
[22:52:47] <thom_> http://jsfiddle.net/fPkL8/1/
[22:53:48] <thom_> if anyone is here why is my tokenClassIndex not iterating past 1
[22:53:53] <thom_> if i have 3 line items
[22:53:57] <thom_> it goes 0, 1, 1
[22:54:07] <thom_> it goes into the loop and prints the test 0ne two two
[22:54:16] <thom_> so it goes into the  loop but it doesn't ++
[22:56:41] <Woet> thom_: can you please bother to make your code actually work?
[22:56:54] <Woet> for example, start by removing all unrelated code and pick the library on the left
[22:57:14] <thom_> wow i forget how people get in these rooms...
[22:57:32] <thom_> its not going to work no matter what because thers no html to accompany it
[22:57:38] <thom_> im just looking at the loop at the end
[22:57:40] <Woet> okay, add the HTML then
[22:58:00] <Woet> (only the relevant HTML)
[22:58:32] <Woet> this is essential because A) 90% of the time the problem is elsewhere and having a minimal example will make this clear
[22:59:01] <Woet> and B) we're here to help you, so make it as easy as possible for us to spot the problem or else a lot of people won't bother looking into it
[23:08:05] <thom_> that would have been a bit complex ifigured it out myself
[23:08:10] <thom_> thank you
[23:08:11] <thom_> though
[23:53:23] <Ububegin> Hi, currently I have added a <a href/> tag before the table using $('#table1').before('<a href...') .. how do I insert this tag inside the caption tag of the table1... let's say even if I give the caption an id.. is it possible to insert at that tag rather than before or after...
[23:59:10] <Clorith> Ububegin: .text() or .html() I think are your only options (someone feel free to correct me)
