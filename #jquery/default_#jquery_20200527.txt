[05:26:57] <mrjson> Hi, how to put my json correct so I only get "message" to each company once -- > https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/1/
[05:27:35] <Cork> that isn't json
[05:27:45] <Cork> your building an array of objects
[05:27:49] <Cork> json is string
[05:28:22] <mrjson> srry, yes I meant that :)
[05:28:38] <mrjson> heres correct version but still failed: https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/2/
[05:29:34] <mrjson> when I console.log out I just want message to happen once to each company
[05:30:11] <Cork> mrjson: loop over div[customer] instead of input
[05:30:27] <Cork> then you can pick the fields relevant to that customer instead of all of htem
[05:30:32] <Cork> *them
[05:30:44] <Cork> then it is just $(this).find('textarea')
[05:30:50] <Cork> *then it is just $(this).find('textarea').val()
[05:30:59] <mrjson> I think I wanna change the push()
[05:31:19] <Cork> you can't really do that
[05:31:32] <mrjson> So I only get each company once and then all values inside
[05:31:42] <Cork> you can change the array to an object and do result[customer].<key> = value
[05:31:53] <Cork> ya, so again loop over div not inputs
[05:34:05] <mrjson> okey, that gives me only 4 like I want. but its not containing all values
[05:34:20] <mrjson> all cities
[05:34:35] <Cork> ya, cause you have to find the input/textarea fields in the div
[05:34:56] <Cork> for example $(this).find(':input') and loop that
[05:35:06] <Cork> or if you prefer to find each input separately
[05:36:27] <mrjson> Cork: done this here, but only get one city: https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/4/
[05:36:44] <mrjson> want all cities with values for each company
[05:38:04] <Cork> uh, well for one you have multiple matches so you can't use .attr it will only pick the first one
[05:38:21] <Cork> and when we're at it, don't use customer attributes without prefixing them with data-
[05:38:37] <Cork> s/customer/custom/
[05:38:55] <Cork> it risk breaking with future spec changes
[05:39:07] <mrjson> ok, will change that.
[05:39:19] <Cork> (data- is a standard prefix and is reserved for custom attributes)
[05:40:15] <Cork> anyway you will have to do $.map($(this).find('input'), function(elm) { return this.getAtribute('city'); }); for example
[05:41:36] <mrjson> now I have changed to data- > https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/5/
[05:44:45] <mrjson> Cork: tried here with map --> https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/6/
[05:44:54] <mrjson> think Im doing something wrong
[05:45:17] <mrjson> they contains no data when console.log
[05:57:35] <mrjson> Cork: got it to work now. https://jsfiddle.net/oq8w2rev/7/
[05:58:53] <Cork> looks correct to me
[06:01:27] <codecutter> i'm using moment js to format date but i'm getting 'invalid date' on line 5 and 18 here https://pastebin.com/H41yYnzQ
[06:09:48] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[06:10:48] <Cork> codecutter: ya, that isn
[06:11:00] <Cork> *'t a strandard format so you have to give it a format string
[06:11:38] <Cork> (or make sure that what ever generates it goves a two digit hour)
[06:11:45] <Cork> *gives*
[06:13:25] <codecutter> Cork: can I see the formated version?
[06:13:43] <codecutter> 2020-05-27T9:53:04
[06:13:53] <Cork> you mean the correct version?
[06:13:58] <codecutter> yes :)
[06:14:03] <Cork> s/T/T0/
[06:14:31] <Cork> a day have more then 9 ours so one digt can't reprecent it
[06:15:13] <codecutter> '09:53:04'?
[06:15:22] <Cork> yup
[06:15:52] <Cork> and by format string i meant a format for the parser to use to understand the format
[06:16:02] <Cork> what we talk about now is the date string
[06:20:33] <codecutter> gotcha
[09:15:05] <banshi> hello all
[09:15:37] <banshi> how do I debug in Firefox this page? : example.com/index.php?route=checkout/checkout
[09:16:03] <Cork> uh, what?
[09:20:41] <banshi> if I try to inspect just example.com/index.php - then I get one source. But example.com/index.php?route=checkout/checkout has another source and I don't know how I could reach it with Firefox debugger
[09:20:50] <banshi> is it more clear now?
[09:22:00] <Cork> sure, but you're in the wrong channel for browser support
[09:22:48] <Cork> personally i would prob just point curl at it
[09:23:39] <banshi> I have to change source directly in browser (interactive mode)
[09:24:01] <Cork> ya, then you would have to contact the support channel for the browser your using
[09:37:35] <Inazad> how I can get the updated content of an iframe ? it contains html code, I want to grab it all even the input values
[09:38:01] <Cork> you have to serialize the dom
[09:38:11] <Cork> the original html isn't updated
[09:39:00] <Inazad> If I have an input text in the iframe. I type "123" in it, how I can get all the html code with the values of the input ?
[09:39:23] <Inazad> Cork, what do u mean by "serialize the dom" ?
[09:40:41] <Cork> you can try document.documentElement.innerHTML
[09:42:09] <Inazad> its an iframe
[09:42:23] <Cork> so get the document of the iframe
[09:42:33] <Cork> note you can only do this if it is from the same domain
[09:42:36] <Inazad> so document.getElementById('myIframe').innerHTML ?
[09:42:38] <Cork> else the browser will block you
[09:42:44] <Inazad> Cork, its the same domain
[09:42:53] <Inazad> its an iframe created dynamically
[09:43:01] <Cork> Inazad: ok, why are you in jquery?
[09:43:14] <Cork> none of these questions is about jqeury
[09:43:19] <Inazad> I want to access the HTML in the iframe
[09:43:27] <Inazad> that after I pass to an ajax query to save it
[09:43:48] <Inazad> I was using " $('#templateFrame').contents().find("html").html() " but it do not returns the iframe updated html
[09:47:20] <Cork> it should
[09:47:35] <Cork> its the same innerHTML as the other one
[09:47:44] <Cork> might be you have multiple ids in the page
[09:47:57] <Cork> (multiple ids with the same value)
[09:51:07] <Inazad> it doesn't work
[09:51:36] <Cork> can't really help you with the info you've provided
[09:51:50] <Inazad> Cork, I want to get the updated HTML code in the iframe
[09:52:06] <Cork> well and the command you've tried should have given you that
[09:52:14] <Cork> so the problem is somewhere else
[09:52:15] <Inazad> Cork, it gives me the original HTML
[09:55:49] <Inazad> Cork, If I type "123" in an input text in the iframe, I don't get the "<input type="text" value="123">"    I stays at empty value
[09:56:16] <Cork> you won't ever get that
[09:56:23] <Cork> that is dom state it isn't stored in html
[09:57:17] <Inazad> Cork how I can so ?
[09:58:53] <Cork> Inazad: you would have to bind an event handler on the input and convert the state to attribute
[09:59:17] <Cork> note though that this is a security risk if password or emails or simiar is ever entered there
[09:59:39] <Inazad> Cork, I cannot bind an event, its dynamic form that user can type their html
[09:59:48] <Cork> ok, then you can't do it
[09:59:53] <Inazad> Cork this is why I want to save the whole html
[10:00:23] <Cork> i guess you could loop over all the input fields and set the attribute
[10:00:35] <Cork> but depending on how many fields there is that might be slow
[10:01:15] <Inazad> Cork so there is no way that I can get the whole HTML source ?
[10:01:27] <Cork> sure, and that is what you are getting
[10:01:43] <Cork> input value state is not the same as value attribute
[10:01:53] <Cork> the value attribute is the initial value for the input field
[10:02:05] <Cork> it is used for form reset for example
[10:02:36] <Hoppelhase> How does .val() work then?
[10:02:46] <Cork> elm.value
[10:02:53] <Cork> it gets the property of the dom element
[10:03:05] <Cork> while html is elm.getAttribute()
[10:03:07] <Cork> kinda
[10:03:18] <Cork> and property and attribute are two different things
[10:03:32] <Cork> hense why jquery has .prop() and .attr() now days
[10:03:43] <Hoppelhase> And which version does .serialize() use?
[10:04:07] <Cork> none of jquerys methods except for :contains() uses html
[10:04:14] <Cork> they all work with the dom
[10:05:24] <Hoppelhase> I think it was Inazad who asked that yesterday, and .serialize didn't work either, IIRC
[10:05:58] <Cork> well can't say why as i have litteraly nothing to go on
[10:39:55] <Inazad> Cork so there is no way that I can get the iframe html source
[10:40:07] <Inazad> * the updated one * with the input value in it
[10:40:54] <Plazma> so i've got an event handler working on some dynamically created input fields. All of those input fields have unique ID's and my event handler uses ('body').on('event', 'ID-1', ...). I need to essentially add this handler to all unique ID fields i have
[10:42:08] <Inazad> Hoppelhase, yeah I'm stuck
[10:42:22] <Inazad> Hoppelhase, I need a way to get the HTML updated with all the states / values
[10:42:48] <Inazad> Hoppelhase, otherwise, how I can use html form and text without an iframe ?
[10:43:55] <Plazma> i tried putting my event handler code within a loop for(var i =0, i < len; i++) { ('body').on('event', 'ID-' + i, ...) but that didn't work .. which i expected it probably wouldn't
[10:45:18] <Plazma> not sure how to phrase this problem properly enough to get good results on the internet, either
[10:46:27] <taplar> Inazad acces to iframe contents is going to depend upon if the contents of the iframe reside within the same domain.  otherwise it will be restricted by the browser.
[10:46:40] <Inazad> taplar, same domain yes
[10:47:01] <Inazad> taplar, I don't load from a source, I create an iframe and the append the iframe from an ajax dource
[10:47:02] <Inazad> source*
[10:47:18] <taplar> Then yes you should be able to access the iframes contents
[10:47:26] <Inazad> taplar, so this is why if I modify the iframe content, I want the updated content
[10:47:42] <Inazad> taplar, so how I can do this
[10:47:55] <taplar> do you have an example of the issue?
[10:48:44] <Hoppelhase> Plazma: Can't you add a class on all those input fields?
[10:49:29] <Plazma> yea goodb idea
[10:50:09] <Inazad> taplar, yes
[10:52:05] <Inazad> taplar, I gonna do a jsfiddle
[10:52:11] <taplar> awesome
[10:56:28] <Inazad> taplar, check this https://jsfiddle.net/s4dg3oL0/
[10:56:44] <Inazad> taplar, click on "Put html"... enter 123 in the input text and click on "Read iFrame content"
[10:56:48] <Inazad> taplar, check the console
[10:57:19] <taplar> ok, both of those buttons worked for me in ff
[10:58:00] <Inazad> taplar, yeah
[10:58:22] <Inazad> taplar, if you type 123 in the input text and then click the read iframe content, do you got the input text value "123"?
[10:59:04] <taplar> oh, that's probably because it's reading the html
[10:59:09] <taplar> lets see...
[10:59:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3vgyu9rh/
[11:01:01] <taplar> At some level with the browser, there is a distinction between the html that is used to generate the DOM, and the values later updated in the DOM.  The DOM is not always reflected in the html.
[11:01:49] <taplar> *html source
[11:03:45] <Inazad> taplar, so how I can get the " <input type="text" value="123"> " from the iframe ?
[11:04:27] <Inazad> taplar, I need the whole html in the iframe with the <input type="text" value="123">
[11:05:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/3vgyu9rh/1/  one approach would be to force the reflection of the value into the element attribute
[11:05:25] <Inazad> taplar, I want to click on "Read iframe..."   should return " <input type="text"> ".  I type 123 in the input, reclick on read iframe and I wanna get " <input type="text" value="123"> "
[11:05:52] <Inazad> taplar, wow I think you got it
[11:08:17] <Inazad> taplar, if I have checkbox, can I set the checkbox checked in the same way ?
[11:09:21] <taplar> it would be slightly different, as with a checkbox the state is determined by the existance of the `checked` attribute.  So rather than using setAttribute, you would either be adding it or removing it.
[11:09:39] <taplar> so it might be a pairing of setAttribute and removeAttribute
[11:10:12] <Inazad> taplar, so I will check if the element is checked, I set attribute checked
[11:10:22] <taplar> e.target.checked ? e.target.addAttribute('checked', '') : e.target.removeAttribute('checked')
[11:10:26] <taplar> possibly ^
[11:12:59] <Inazad> taplar, what is the e => e ?
[11:13:53] <Inazad> taplar, Uncaught TypeError: e.target.addAttribute is not a function
[11:13:56] <taplar> it's an ES6 arrow function.  It is a reduced form of a function declaration that doesn't provide all the default properties a normal function does, but in certain cases can still work, and makes for shorter code.
[11:14:02] <taplar> mmm, let me see...
[11:14:10] <Inazad> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/p8em241d/
[11:14:29] <taplar> sorry, not addAttribute.  `setAttribute`
[11:14:33] <Inazad> OK
[11:15:04] <Inazad> taplar, I got " <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"on\" checked=\"\"> "
[11:15:06] <Inazad> it is OK ?
[11:15:14] <taplar> yeah that's fine
[11:15:20] <Inazad> even if checked is empty ?
[11:15:45] <Inazad> its OK
[11:15:46] <taplar> `checked` is a boolean attribute by web standards.  The value is ignored, regardless of what it is
[11:16:01] <taplar> It's mear existance defines if it is checked or not
[11:16:10] <Inazad> so we do not use checked="checked" ?
[11:16:35] <taplar> you can, but it is unnecessary.  unless perhaps you are using some very old browser that maybe relied on that
[11:17:11] <taplar> https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute  if you want to read up on it
[11:17:22] <Uhkis> for the fun of it, you can do checked="false" and it's still checked
[11:19:12] <Inazad> taplar, thank you very much
[11:23:34] <Inazad> taplar, when I use it in my code, it doesn't work
[11:23:44] <taplar> which part?
[11:23:58] <Inazad> it do not replace the value in the input
[11:24:08] <Inazad> do I need to include a special library ?
[11:24:30] <taplar> you just need jQuery for what you were attempting in the fiddle
[11:24:44] <Inazad> OK
[11:24:53] <Inazad> cause when I call my function, its said undefined
[11:25:04] <taplar> which function?
[11:25:44] <Inazad> templateFrame.find('input').on('input', e => e.target.setAttribute('value', e.target.value));
[11:26:27] <taplar> which part specifically said undefined?
[11:27:06] <Inazad> it works finally
[11:29:17] <Plazma> Hoppelhase: thanks! I got that part working, now how would i go abouttaking the input from that field and placing it in yet another dynamically created element?
[11:30:56] <banshi> who is good at opencart?
[11:30:58] <taplar> Plazma an element being dynamic shouldn't be an issue when putting data into it, as you can only put a value into something that exists.
[11:31:56] <Plazma> taplar: hm, so i have a class on it and was trying to do ('.class').text(myInput);
[11:32:13] <taplar> What kind of element is it?
[11:32:28] <Plazma> teh destination element? just a text input
[11:32:41] <Plazma> that is disabled
[11:32:46] <taplar> ok, so you want to use `val(<newValue>)` if you are trying to change the value
[11:32:54] <Plazma> ohhh
[11:33:00] <Plazma> that makes sense..
[11:33:03] <taplar> `text()` is for changing <tag>this part</tag>
[11:33:09] <Plazma> ahh right right, ok lets try that
[11:35:27] <Plazma> taplar: ok that definitely works, but i have several elements with unique id's and since i have a class bound to them all, it's updating all of them
[11:35:36] <Plazma> so i need to somehow differentiate that
[11:35:52] <taplar> typically that would involve some form of contextual lookup
[11:36:14] <Plazma> i do have a unique ID number that is associated with them, since they match the source input ID numbers
[11:36:24] <taplar> do you have an example of what your markup looks like?
[11:36:46] <Plazma> not readily available since it's a work thing :/
[11:36:53] <taplar> i typically shy away from using ids.  lots of people over use them and avoid learning contextual lookups
[11:36:58] <taplar> ok, one sec.
[11:37:16] <Plazma> i'm open to a better way of doing things , though.. kinda got thrown on to this project and now i'm the lead somehow
[11:37:27] <Plazma> and telling others what to do that know less than me about it, heh
[11:37:58] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/a/59888053/1586174  Give this answer a once over.  I provided an example of a use case for some contextual lookups
[11:39:46] <Plazma> will do, thanks
[11:39:53] <taplar> yup, np
[11:40:34] <taplar> it seems like it's becoming my programmer goal in life to make people aware of contextual lookups, >:)
[11:42:45] <Plazma> is that a good thing or ba thing
[11:43:28] <taplar> heh, dunno.  i think understanding them is a very good thing.  i'm just always perplexed why they are not used more.
[11:43:49] <taplar> not sure if the schools are not teaching it, or if it's just something people who learn on their own don't readily pick up, or what
[11:54:04] <Plazma> taplar: well i'm definitely not a web guy.. officially so, kinda learning as i go
[11:54:16] <taplar> nothing wrong with that
[11:55:21] <Plazma> taplar: so your post makes sense, but it's not quite working for me, the console is returning undefined. doing $(e.target).closest('input').find('.myclass').val()
[11:56:07] <taplar> Ok, so keep in mind that `closest()` is used to find a parent element, that the element you are acting upon belongs to
[11:56:22] <taplar> So ask yourself, can an input be a parent of anything?
[11:56:44] <Plazma> i don't think so.. but a div could be.. if i recall
[11:59:15] <taplar> Within the scope of that answer, notice how it identified the rows of the table, as being the context by which things were grouped.  Each context contained all the associated elements.  So going up to the context allowed then finding the nested related elements to change/reference
[11:59:42] <taplar> So take a look at your markup first, and try to identify what context(s) exist that group your related elements, separately
[12:00:09] <Plazma> hmm alright, that makes sense
[12:16:10] <kittonian> hi all. I am working with a multi-level accordion and have it all working except that for some reason I cannot get it to add the active class to the sub accordion. I created a codepen at https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/qBOGQBz
[12:19:40] <Inazad> taplar, I don't understand why isn't working
[12:19:49] <Inazad> taplar, I run the 3 lines in Chrome console
[12:20:42] <taplar> k, brb as i get lunch.  let me know if you are seeing errors or what's happening.
[12:20:59] <Inazad> OK
[12:21:07] <Inazad> taplar, what do you do for work man ?
[12:23:57] <kittonian> never mind. i fixed it
[12:34:25] <taplar> Inazad i'm a tech guy for a retail company
[12:35:52] <Inazad> taplar, cool
[12:36:57] <Inazad> taplar, I have jquery 3.1.1  I think its the problem
[12:37:10] <Inazad> cause I do it in fiddle, everything works
[12:37:53] <Inazad> but it doesn't work on my code
[12:37:57] <taplar> I don't have the fiddle pulled up right now, but iirc, the methods you were using shouldn't be different between those versions
[12:38:13] <taplar> let me find that fiddle again
[12:38:20] <Inazad> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/p8em241d/
[12:38:30] <taplar> gracias
[12:38:41] <Inazad> taplar, this one
[12:38:41] <Inazad> https://jsfiddle.net/p8em241d/1/
[12:39:27] <Inazad> I call those lines (find...on..) when I submit my form
[12:39:41] <Inazad> the code is in a form submit handler, does it matter ?
[12:40:04] <taplar> do you prevent the form submit when you perform that logic?
[12:40:42] <taplar> because a normal form submit is going to perform a page transfer
[12:40:43] <Inazad> yes
[12:40:47] <Inazad> preventDefault()
[12:40:50] <taplar> k
[12:41:09] <Inazad> its like that he do not replace the HTML in the iframe
[12:41:17] <Inazad> it do not update it
[12:41:33] <taplar> can you show me what you are doing for your form submit?
[12:41:46] <taplar> or can you make that fiddle behave in the same manner?
[12:42:37] <Inazad> too many code
[12:43:01] <taplar> should be able to make just a dummy form that you do your submit handler on that does whatever the logic is
[12:43:24] <Inazad> how I can know if the lines works ?
[12:44:02] <taplar> if you want to debug your logic yourself, you can always use the browser debugger in a couple ways.  what browser are you using?
[12:44:19] <Inazad> Chrome
[12:44:23] <taplar> k, one sec
[12:45:11] <taplar> ok, so hit F12.  this should bring up the developer tools of chrome.  are you familiar with them?
[12:45:39] <Inazad> yes
[12:45:41] <taplar> i guess so since you said you were looking at the console
[12:46:03] <taplar> so if you swap over to the "Sources" tab, this is the tab that will let you debug your code
[12:46:33] <Inazad> OK then ?
[12:46:37] <Plazma> taplar: ok so i did some digging/toying and it looks like my event handler that i have my contextual lookkup in, isn't finding my class because it's BELOW it.. as in .class1 comes first, .class2 comes second, and it's .class2 i'm trying to do the lookup on and update the input field
[12:47:17] <taplar> So on that https://jsfiddle.net/p8em241d/1/ fiddle, if you swap over to the Sources tab, on the left hand side you should see a file system listing, or if not there should be a little []>] box looking icon to expand out to see the file listing
[12:47:54] <Inazad> taplar, it do not replace the value
[12:48:01] <Inazad> like the find function is not working
[12:48:18] <taplar> right, i'm trying to show you a way where you can debug this yourself to see what your code is doing
[12:48:18] <Inazad> taplar, maybe we should do it in the old method ? other than ES6 ?
[12:48:29] <Inazad> taplar, yep I see, its very cool
[12:48:58] <taplar> So once you have that open, if you expand the `js` folder and click the `choices.js` file, it will show you the contents of it
[12:49:08] <Inazad> yes I'm in
[12:49:21] <taplar> Once you are inside that file, see all the line number on the left hand side?  Try clicking one of them.
[12:49:32] <Inazad> yes
[12:49:35] <Inazad> I put a breakpoint
[12:49:39] <taplar> Yep
[12:50:02] <Inazad> taplar, how to know if this line works ? templateFrame.find('input').on('input', e => e.target.setAttribute('value', e.target.value));
[12:50:44] <taplar> so, you can put a breakpoint in your script on/before that line, and once your browser has haulted on that line, you can swap over to your developer console tab and copy and paste it in there
[12:51:02] <taplar> wait wait wait
[12:51:10] <taplar> you're doing this on submit?
[12:52:08] <Inazad> taplar, yes
[12:52:22] <Inazad> taplar, is not good ?
[12:52:27] <taplar> and you are expecting the values to be updated once the submit finishes?
[12:52:40] <Inazad> hmm yes
[12:52:45] <taplar> ok, that's the problem
[12:52:55] <Inazad> taplar, I don't understand
[12:53:30] <taplar> templateFrame.find('input').on('input'   <= this guy.  That is creating an event binding.  The contents of that event handler will not execute until that event happens.
[12:54:42] <Inazad> taplar, Ohhhh
[12:54:48] <Inazad> taplar, so how to fix it then ?
[12:55:03] <Inazad> $( "#patientSuiviFrm" ).submit(function( event ) {
[12:55:03] <Inazad>     event.preventDefault();
[12:55:10] <Inazad> .....  those lines before sending the ajax data
[12:55:14] <taplar> If you want to make the submit do the logic, then you do not need the event binding
[12:55:49] <Inazad> taplar, ok then I need to replace thoses lines by what ?
[12:56:23] <taplar> templateFrame.find('input').each(input => input.setAttribute('value', input.value));
[13:01:10] <Inazad> taplar, I gonna try
[13:05:23] <Inazad> taplar, for the checkboxe, I do templateFrame.find('input').each(input => input.setAttribute('checked', input.checked));
[13:05:37] <Inazad> taplar, it is right ?
[13:05:57] <taplar> since they are both inputs you can combine those two things
[13:08:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/uhap7tsm/  something like that
[13:08:55] <taplar> Plazma do you have an example of your markup that I could see?
[13:10:08] <Inazad> taplar, this is for the checkbox only ?
[13:10:19] <taplar> that's for both
[13:10:21] <Inazad> taplar, its OK I just see the if
[13:10:30] <taplar> notice how it checks the input type to know what to do
[13:10:51] <Inazad> I love this syntax
[13:10:53] <Inazad> its ES6 ?
[13:11:04] <Inazad> whats the difference between ES6 and JQuery / JS ?
[13:11:05] <taplar> the => part is the only ES6 part
[13:11:32] <taplar> jQuery is a library built using javascript.  ES5/ES6 are implementation version of javascript
[13:11:48] <taplar> ES# is short for ECMAScript
[13:12:22] <taplar> And actually that may be inaccurate.
[13:12:52] <taplar> IIRC, ECMAScript is a generalized standard.  Javascript implements the standard, but it could be potentially implemented in different languages.
[13:13:41] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript  to the wiki!
[13:16:32] <Inazad> taplar, input.setAttribute
[13:16:51] <taplar> So, focusing on what jQuery actually is.  jQuery is just a javascript library that has a bunch of boilerplate code prewritten for you so that you do not have to write it yourself.  Historically, different browsers and different versions of the same browser, have different ways of implementing javascript logic.  Some may do it differently, others
[13:16:51] <taplar> may not do it at all.  The original purpose of jQuery was to smooth that consideration out, by allowing you to use the library methods, and jQuery takes care of figuring out how to make it work in the browser you are in.
[13:16:52] <Inazad> taplar, is not a function
[13:17:17] <taplar> oh, right, cause of the stupid index.
[13:17:37] <Inazad> taplar, Uncaught TypeError: input.setAttribute is not a function
[13:17:38] <taplar> change `.each(input =>` to `.each((index, input) =>`
[13:17:56] <Inazad> taplar, wow I would never find it haha
[13:18:40] <taplar> native javascript passes the element in as the first argument for its native `forEach` method, but jQuery passes the index first.  something that sometimes bites me when swapping back and forth
[13:19:07] <Inazad> taplar, yeah
[13:23:42] <taplar> Something I forgot to mention earlier when I was showing you the debugging stuff.  In addition to setting the breakpoints with the browser, you can also set breakpoint in the code itself.  So if it is hard to find in the browser where the code is, you can put a `debugger;` statement in the actual code and it will behave the same way
[13:24:48] <Inazad> debugger; ?
[13:24:53] <Inazad> wow so cool
[13:24:55] <taplar> yep
[13:26:57] <taplar> so any time you're trying to figure out what a method is actually doing, putting a breakpoint in there so you can examine the variables and test out the logic they are going to call, is -really- helpful
[13:28:48] <Inazad> taplar, thx for the info, I wish I knew it a long time ago :-)
[13:28:57] <taplar> heh
[13:31:26] <Plazma> taplar: i figured it out! thanks for all your help
[13:31:37] <Plazma> i had to re-think the up the dom tree stuff,
[13:32:23] <taplar> Plazma awesome! :)
[13:33:05] <Plazma> taplar: it's nice to be able to add some dynamic things fairly easiyl to our application without having to rew-rite the whole thing in React or Vue or whatever is out there
[13:33:36] <taplar> yep, rewrites suck (though I am a fan of Vue)
[13:33:39] <Plazma> which was my rabbit hole i spent 2 hours in learning yesterday, thinking they might be the better solution
[13:33:59] <Plazma> our backend is currently python and nginix/uwsgi so
[13:34:11] <Plazma> lot of work already went into the python parts, and the flask/bottle stuff
[13:34:41] <Plazma> taplar: took me like all day to figure this stuff out though, i feel like a complete moron
[13:37:34] <taplar> don't worry about it.  different people have different histories with stuff.  it is a lot easier once you have a history with issues of a subject matter.  you can't be expected to know everything
[13:45:27] <Plazma> taplar: yea i know :/ i push myself to though , it's a paradox
[13:46:16] <taplar> definitely understand that.  but just wanted to say it, cause you also have to be realistic at a point.
[13:47:01] <Plazma> yea, i started doing thsi more about 8 months ago, started with CSS by hand, then was told that's pretty old school, so started making things with foundation, did a tiny bit with javascript to add to it.. was passing data to a separate python cli application, then we merged it all
[13:47:06] <Plazma> got it running on nginix
[13:47:15] <Plazma> merged it all into one repository too
[13:47:42] <Plazma> learned a lot doing things, and now this is another facet/new peice of it, so i can kinda make it  abit better from the get go
[13:47:59] <taplar> for my knowledge, what is foundation?
[13:48:15] <Plazma> it's just a CSS framework , boostrap? is the other one i found out about
[13:48:21] <Plazma> i think it can do a lot more too
[13:48:21] <taplar> ah, gotcha
[13:48:39] <Plazma> but it makes it look ilke i know what i'm doing, so i'm ok with that
[13:48:44] <taplar> heh
[13:48:51] <Plazma> jquery is also helping me there too
[16:30:11] <z1haze> does anyone know if scripts loaded via $.getScript would be cached in the browser the same was normal <script src are?
[16:32:45] <jak2000> hi all https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/2hpry0t6/6/   when user edit 1 row... and change QTy, how to multupli Qty * price and store in total?
[16:34:49] <Hoppelhase> z1haze: Did you see the documentation for getScript()?
[16:35:31] <z1haze> i guess not enough
[16:36:24] <z1haze> egh
[16:36:38] <z1haze> no clean way to do it. fun
[16:37:02] <z1haze> ajax it is
[16:37:57] <Hoppelhase> Yeah, they could have just added an option for it
[17:43:51] <jak2020> hi all https://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/2hpry0t6/6/   when user edit 1 row... and change QTy, how to multupli Qty * price and store in total?
[18:11:33] <forgotmynick> hello. with .each is it possible to sleep/wait before it does the next iteration?
[18:21:32] <Hoppelhase> What do you want to do with the elements?
[19:21:57] <Hoppelhase> What CSS attribute do you have to set for an element such that .fadeIn() undoes it?
[19:27:30] <Hoppelhase> displaY: none works for normal text, but for <li> elements the label is faded in
[20:58:47] <Plazma> oh taplar must be in bed
