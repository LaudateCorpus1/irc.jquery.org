[08:46:59] <byteframe> I use val to set the contents of a text area, but it loses alot of characters (they turn into '?') this includes the colon ':' and russian and asian characters.
[08:47:03] <byteframe> what do I do?
[09:15:56] <Rilex> hello? i need help
[12:23:10] <arunkumar413> What is the simplest way to set up a web server
[12:25:56] <shoky_> if you got python, `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`..  if you got node, `node i -g http-server` then `http-server`.. otherwise, download one of those, or an http server, and run it :P
[12:34:21] <halftroll>  /wc
[12:34:26] <halftroll> :\
[12:36:14] <_sillymarketing> hola, can anyone help me with animating this column transition, when you click the Menu button: http://bearideas.fr/who-we-are/
[12:36:35] <_sillymarketing> Using that as inspiration, trying to figure out how to mimic it inside 4 `col-xs-3` bootstrap columns
[12:43:49] <z1haze> does $.ajax return a promise?
[12:49:08] <Duikb00t-home> Someone here ever used MixItUp ( jquery ) ? :)
[13:25:35] <shoky_> z1haze: a jquery promise, yes. (standard promise in jq 3)
[13:26:01] <z1haze> so if i want to return a standard promise i have to wrap it i guess?
[13:26:32] <shoky_> if using jq < 3, ya, i guess
[13:26:59] <z1haze> oh right
[13:27:04] <z1haze> im actually using jq3
[13:27:17] <z1haze> so do I not need to do something like this then? http://dpaste.com/323Y3DT
[13:27:59] <shoky_> nop
[13:28:04] <z1haze> well then
[13:28:17] <z1haze> guess i wasted my time
[13:35:09] <Elles> hello. anyone working with latest materialize 0.98 having problems with textarea expanding?
[13:49:42] <uskerine> hi, can someone help me to understand why alert is not working here? https://snag.gy/p4iYdb.jpg  |  https://bpaste.net/show/ccdb3192d620
[13:50:04] <uskerine> how could I debug this?
[13:50:22] <uskerine> request comes to server and it is expected to return a 200 Ok
[13:51:10] <uskerine> https://snag.gy/UnhqYm.jpg here it can be seen the 200 Ok
[14:05:22] <pavonia> uskerine: "Content-Length: 0"
[14:09:52] <uskerine> pavonia, I am not returning anything, just 200 Ok
[14:10:04] <uskerine> I have noticed that if I test for statusCode 200 then it works
[14:10:05] <uskerine> any tip?
[14:11:04] <pavonia> What's the problem exactly?
[14:11:07] <Duikb00t-home> o.
[14:11:15] <Duikb00t-home> o/
[14:12:17] <uskerine> I am wondering why success/error do not work
[14:13:05] <uskerine> just trying understand the mechanics behind AJAX calls
[14:13:30] <pavonia> It should call error. Doesn't it call any of the handlers for you?
[14:13:54] <uskerine> on 200 Ok success does not work
[14:14:06] <uskerine> I will try to return other code and see what happesn
[14:14:09] <pavonia> Ah, you called it "failure"
[14:14:56] <uskerine> shall I call it error?
[14:15:31] <uskerine> with error it works when I return say a 444
[14:15:41] <uskerine> why success does not work with 200 Ok?
[14:15:55] <pavonia> Because you don't return any data
[14:16:13] <uskerine> so you have to return something
[14:17:02] <pavonia> You request a JSON object, so you have to return a JSON object
[14:17:34] <uskerine> Can I just send a JSON object and request nothing?
[14:17:45] <uskerine> and where exactly do I request a JSON object?
[14:18:02] <uskerine> I definitively submit a JSON object
[14:18:06] <Duikb00t-home> :( dammit
[14:19:22] <pavonia> uskerine: You can return {} or null or something like that. Usually, you want to return an object that indicates that the call succeeded
[14:20:12] <Duikb00t-home> Has someone an idea what might be wrong? I ahve at the bottom 2instances of the jquery mixitup plugins: https://goo.gl/OshJnU
[14:20:20] <Duikb00t-home> but they are not working  seperately :(
[14:20:37] <Duikb00t-home> This is an example where they work as seperate instances:: http://jsfiddle.net/00s7fgny/
[14:20:46] <Duikb00t-home> Why can't it work at my side, where am I going wrong :s
[14:22:25] <uskerine> pavonia, is it possible to request nothing and just submit the JSON object and check return code (200 Ok=?
[14:22:36] <uskerine> I return a {} and it works fine
[14:22:52] <uskerine> but if my Ok/Nook is handled with  the 200 Ok I see no point in returning an empty JSON
[14:23:31] <pavonia> Yes, check https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ for "statusCode"
[14:23:56] <uskerine> I understand how to use statusCode
[14:24:05] <uskerine> but, if I return 200Ok and no content, it raises error too
[14:24:26] <uskerine> you said I am requesting a JSON object, and I am wondering where exactly in the code I request that
[14:24:50] <pavonia> dataType: "json"
[14:25:15] <pavonia> Maybe dataType: "text" works
[14:28:26] <uskerine> I removed dataType and it works
[14:29:25] <uskerine> thanks pavonia, now I understand better how this works
[14:29:42] <Duikb00t-home> great
[14:52:48] <uskerine> I want to show a bootstrap modal, once the user clicks on "Ok" and modal is closed, I would like to redirect to another page
[14:52:53] <uskerine> $('#user_created').modal('show');
[14:52:55] <uskerine> what do I do here?
[15:11:19] <patrickk> how can I get the updated value of data attribute, set by Ajax
[15:27:40] <Caspan_> is there an easy way to select a TR that has a data-id="1231" and then get a different tag value data-type and get its value
[15:28:12] <Caspan_> the data-type is in the same TR tag
[15:30:17] <Caspan_> $("tr[data-id='1231']") i can use that to select the TR
[15:32:22] <Caspan_> $("tr[data-id='ID']").data("type")  i am assuming that but its returning nothing
[15:34:13] <Caspan_> seems like my variabe ID is not being parsed to its value
[15:37:15] <Caspan_> Got it now
[21:20:05] <acidjazz> anyone here good with illustrator?
[23:53:36] <alhof> when POSTing, does jquery send a checkboxes field of only one checked item as a string?
