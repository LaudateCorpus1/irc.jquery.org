[00:04:26] <akurilin> Quick question for you guys: do I have to .off() a jQuery UI tooltip mouseover event created with .tooltip() when I delete the element it was applied to? It's my understanding that with standard DOM events you usually don't have to, but jQuery keeps track of its own events in a separate list and so you need to manually remove them. Correct?
[00:06:23] <shoky> akurilin: you don't need to .off() anything
[00:06:33] <shoky> akurilin: if you remove the element with .remove(), that is
[00:08:47] <akurilin> shoky: awesome! Does .remove() take care of events/data for children of the removed element as well? Can't quite tell from the documentation.
[00:09:44] <shoky> akurilin: yeah it should take care of it
[00:10:54] <akurilin> shoky: Great, thank you!
[00:11:19] <hip2p> Anyone know how to fix this? ctrl-click will get you a circle. clicking on the circle will get you another one. clicking on the 2nd one should trigger an alert. The problem is that the 2nd circle has two classes: 'n' and 'd', and the .on is looking for circle[class='n']. How can I alert the .on() so that I can still use multiple classes? http://jsfiddle.net/TyVtW/15/
[00:17:10] <hip2p> I seem to have stumped both stackoverflow and freenode.
[00:21:31] <shoky> hip2p: you can use  [class~="n"]
[00:24:21] <shoky> and if you're doing attribute filtering anyway, you can just use multiple attributes
[00:27:40] <hip2p> shoky wins! Thank you.

[04:15:06] <ben-_> Hi, I'm a total newbie to jQuery (sorry in advanced), and would like to know if something is possible, if it is possible, I'd like to please get directions or reference to how it should be done. *Long introduction over* What I'm looking to do is have a user insert a URL (link to external web, by external I mean, not located on my server), then have the user see the page from the link rendered
[04:15:06] <ben-_> to him (either in a new window or internal window), then have the user mark some text in the opened page, and extract (from the parent page) the text the user chose.. Sorry if this is a bit unclear, but I'm here to clearify anything not understood, thanks in advanced for the help...
[04:15:26] <ben-_> *Pif* that was long, again, thanks for the help, I greatly appreciate it.
[04:16:03] <spobat> answer: $('#channels-list li:last').before(entry);
[04:17:11] <ben-_> spobat: sorry, was that aimed at me?
[04:17:23] <spobat> no
[04:17:26] <spobat> :S
[04:17:31] <spobat> was the answer to my  own question
[04:17:49] <ben-_> ok.

[05:18:54] <spobat> shouldnt the right hand side be in " ?
[05:30:54] <fast1kz> codacoder it doesnt work
[05:30:58] <fast1kz> i dont know why
[05:31:18] <fast1kz> only works: $(this).attr('rel') = ?spell=28672
[05:31:23] <fast1kz> fail

[05:31:42] <fast1kz> seems all ajax request didnt work
[05:34:20] <SomeoneSomeone> Is there any jQuery object method that returns the clasess of the element the selector is wrapped around? Like so: classesOfTheElement = $(elementHere).functionIAmLookingFor();;
[05:34:28] <SomeoneSomeone> This is probably a stupid question, sorry.
[05:35:10] <SomeoneSomeone> I can't find anything in the API if I search for "returns classes"
[05:35:18] <SomeoneSomeone> *return classes
[05:37:42] <sacho> SomeoneSomeone, you could fetch the class attribute. There's also functions to check for specific classes, e.g. http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/class-attribute/
[05:39:23] <xec> SomeoneSomeone: native dom has https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.classList
[05:40:26] <SomeoneSomeone> All right, thanks xec. You mean like $(element).class, sacho?
[05:40:37] <SomeoneSomeone> Because that's returning undefined for what I am trying to do.
[05:40:40] <sacho> not exactly.
[05:42:22] <sacho> you could use .attr
[05:42:27] <fast1kz> i need help with http://pastebin.com/2KTjuuny i cant understand why dont work
[05:42:33] <fast1kz> only works: $(this).attr('data-tip','Loading...');
[05:42:37] <fast1kz> seems all ajax request didnt work
[05:42:41] <SomeoneSomeone> Sorry, right. I am quite new to this and I keep forgetting simple things like thta.
[05:43:57] <SomeoneSomeone> That worked, sacho.
[05:44:21] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, I've got some weird moootools vs jQuery issue. My app gets included as JS so I have to ensur they play nice with each other. Anyway, I am only ever referencing jQuery and not $. Now, the problem is that sometimes a variable that is passed to a callback is not the "original" variable anymore which I passed, but suddenlty it's a mootools-function. E.g., i pass {user:{name:'asdf'}} but...
[05:44:22] <JD-Robbs> ...the function receives some weird mootols-stuff. How is that possible, and how can I stop that? Surely it cannot be caused by variable names etc? Anyway, any pointers are highly appreciated! :-)
[05:44:50] <sacho> code example
[05:48:01] <fast1kz> i need help with http://pastebin.com/2KTjuuny i cant understand why dont work

[06:06:03] <KrizOne> nvm guys i realise i need maths.pow thanks :D
[06:06:49] <KrizOne> fast1kz, are you running an ajax call for each .spelltooltip on your page?
[06:07:03] <KrizOne> that might be your problem, how many are there? from that chunk of code it looks like they are all running at once
[06:07:06] <KrizOne> maybe try just 1?

[06:21:42] <iksik> what is a new way of handling with onclick events on content loaded with $.post which contains html markup and some buttons?
[06:21:55] <iksik> i was using live() in previous version, now it's gone
[06:21:56] <iksik> hm
[06:22:00] <KrizOne> .on("click", function(event) {
[06:22:09] <iksik> it doesn't fire :(
[06:22:26] <KrizOne> i think i had a problem with this recently too
[06:22:33] <KrizOne> so .on isnt picking up future elemnts?
[06:22:40] <iksik> nope ;/
[06:22:49] <KrizOne> oh
[06:22:51] <KrizOne> i rmemeber now
[06:22:53] <xec> iksik: $(".parent").on("click", ".futureElement", function() {...})
[06:22:53] <KrizOne> do it like this
[06:22:56] <iksik> i'm using v1.9.1
[06:22:56] <KrizOne> yeah
[06:22:57] <KrizOne> that
[06:23:01] <KrizOne> i do it like this
[06:23:04] <iksik> oh
[06:23:06] <iksik> ok, testing
[06:23:12] <KrizOne> $(document).on("click", "#element", function() {
[06:23:16] <xec> where .parent is the closest ancestor that is always there

[06:54:21] <JD-Robbs> Can it be that mootools suddenly kind of overrides one of my methods and injects some odd callbacks instead of the variables that I pass myself? (mootools vs jQuery issue) Cheers for any pointers! :-)
[06:56:24] <lessless> is it possible to find out jquery version via browser console?
[06:58:05] <xec> lessless: $.fn.jquery
[07:00:08] <JD-Robbs> Just seems a bit odd to me. Because I am passing myobject.myFunction({blah:true},'blah') ... And in myFunction() I get this originating from mootools-core.js --> function (){return v;} ... How is that even possible? :(
[07:00:49] <JD-Robbs> I mean, I get that anonymous function instead of my {blah: true}
[07:01:07] <leonardshelby84> any of you guys had any success with passing back L4 validation "messagebags" to a jquery ajax request?
[07:01:17] <anew> so i'm trying to copy how on google when you press 'next' on searches the screen blurs for a second before your results are shown
[07:01:20] <anew> how can i do thi /
[07:01:21] <anew> this?
[07:02:27] <lessless> xec, anything similar for jquery-ui
[07:02:45] <xec> anew: could be a white transparent overlay, or maybe opacity on body?
[07:02:53] <xec> anew: btw, its not blurred, its faded :)
[07:03:13] <anew> ya however they call it
[07:03:19] <anew> so it's a blurred transparent overlay ?
[07:03:28] <anew> would this be a better question for #css ?
[07:03:32] <xec> no, its not blurred, the page is still just as sharp
[07:03:58] <anew> i mean faded
[07:04:02] <anew> should i ask css
[07:04:16] <xec> anew: try this in your css, body { opacity: .5 }
[07:04:30] <anew> k
[07:05:11] <anew> nothing
[07:05:51] <xec> works in ff and chrome
[07:05:55] <anew> weird
[07:06:06] <anew> ah
[07:06:07] <anew> yeah
[07:06:09] <anew> forgot the decimal
[07:06:21] <anew> ok and then how would you make it so everything is unclickable ?
[07:06:38] <xec> then an overlay would be better
[07:07:15] <anew> overlay .6 ?

[07:33:47] <Xal_> I have a page that displays a calendar. The calendar has buttons that let the use view previous or future months ( the html for which it pulls from the server because of events that are displayed in the month). The problem is that when I call the html() function in the parent element to change the calendar, for a split second it doesn't have anything in it, so its height is reduced to zero,...
[07:33:48] <Xal_> ...shortening the page, and shifting the view back up to the top of the page. Is there a way to have the parent element not redraw until after the html is added to it?
[07:34:34] <Xal_> Or some other way to fix it?

[07:40:00] <xinming> Hi, just curoius on questions for jquery lib in GPL license.
[07:40:27] <xinming> I saw some lib uses GPL v2 license, Does that mean, If I use the lib, I should open source the server side app?
[07:42:51] <goose1> xinming: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12235533/if-i-use-a-gpl-javascript-library-in-my-web-app-does-my-code-need-to-be-gpl-too
[07:43:48] <xinming> goose1: yes, thanks, that's exactly what I am looking for, googled, But didn't find this page
[07:44:41] <goose1> xinming: no definitive answer though
[07:48:12] <goose1> xinming: probably best to keep the client side fully separated from the server (even a different repo if you can). eg that way if you serve gpl js by nginx you cant force nginx to be gpl.
[07:50:28] <xinming> goose1: http://stuck-in-windows.blogspot.jp/2009/02/fud-over-javascript-and-gpl.html
[07:50:34] <xinming> goose1: This is what I found too.
[07:52:50] <Xal_> Is there a way to figure out what the height of the new HTML will be at a particular width before it gets added to the container?
[07:52:51] <aro> is it possible to select items based on attributes?
[07:53:08] <aro> like $(this).find('element[required="required"]')
[07:53:11] <xinming> aro:    [attr="value"] blabla
[07:53:25] <xinming> aro: Your version should work
[07:53:31] <aro> hmm it doesnt though
[07:53:37] <sunbeam> how can I get the HTML of <div class="class"> including the <div class="class"> tag ?
[07:54:01] <aro> check this out
[07:54:18] <goose1> Xal_: just use two containers and swap them once loaded
[07:54:18] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/TZWp3/24
[07:55:47] <aro> its jumping into that if block even when it is a select
[07:59:07] <aro> any idea why?

[08:03:25] <aro> ??
[08:03:29] <masentinel900> Anyone know why is this?
[08:03:30] <aro> use .css('zIndex'
[08:03:48] <aro> $('.selector').css('z-index', value);
[08:03:53] <goose1> aro: what is the problem?
[08:04:03] <aro> goose1: it doesnt select the items
[08:04:43] <aro> specifically, the one that has a value of 'hello'
[08:05:03] <masentinel900> I'm calling the function basically like :: $("#datePicker").datepicker();
[08:05:38] <aro> masentinel900: do you have the right jquery/jqueryui libraries loaded?
[08:05:38] <masentinel900> And, When I going to onclick the input date show me that error log
[08:05:49] <aro> got a link?
[08:06:28] <goose1> yeah sec
[08:06:42] <masentinel900> I have this file appart jquery links,  "jquery.ui.datepicker.js"
[08:06:53] <masentinel900> I need some else?
[08:06:55] <aro> yes
[08:07:00] <aro> you need the core and widget stuff
[08:07:23] <aro> did you read the instructions?

[08:10:50] <goose1> aro: .find().each(function(){})
[08:11:28] <goose1> use chrome and open console in the "run" window so you can see compile errors
[08:11:34] <aro> codacoder: which link are you looking at
[08:12:35] <happyface> anyone know why &#8203; is randomly in my document? I think it has to do with .append or something
[08:12:57] <JD-Robbs> Anyone on how it's possible that mootools can change parameters that are passed into my functions? No idea how that's even technically possible :-/
[08:13:19] <codacoder> aro: apols... I musta been seeing things - my bad

[08:14:04] <aro> codacoder/goose1: http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/TZWp3/24/
[08:14:06] <aro> look at that
[08:14:13] <aro> see how it selects all the 'select' elements too?
[08:14:40] <fast1k> hi
[08:14:40] <fast1k> anyone can help me with http://pastebin.com/2KTjuuny i cant understand why it doesnt work
[08:14:51] <masentinel900> Someone could help me
[08:15:08] <aro> fast1k: there are so many thigns wrong with that
[08:15:09] <goose1> aro: first, you dont need to $(message) just message.length
[08:15:13] <masentinel900> I'm getting this error   ::   insActive is not defined
[08:15:23] <fast1k>  which are them? aro
[08:16:07] <aro> what 'doesn't' happen when you run it?
[08:16:12] <fast1k> it return error
[08:16:15] <aro> what error?
[08:16:19] <fast1k> if i add error function
[08:16:20] <aro> that would help diagnose it
[08:16:24] <aro> whats the error
[08:16:27] <fast1k> what i do then?
[08:16:40] <fast1k> $(this).attr("rel") = ?spell=1
[08:16:40] <aro> tell me the error before i choke you
[08:16:41] <fast1k> for example
[08:16:48] <fast1k> sec
[08:17:11] <fast1k> error: function(xhr, textStatus, errorThrown) {
[08:17:13] <fast1k> this is right?
[08:17:25] <Xal_> goose, found a better way. append the new calendar , then delete all calendars in the containder except for the last. For some reason I was getting two calendars when the page first loads, but this way takes care of that, too.
[08:17:50] <fast1k> error: function(xhr, textStatus, errorThrown) {  alert(xhr + ' ' + textStatus + ' ' + errorThrown); }
[08:17:52] <aro> masentinel900: is it inactive or insactive
[08:18:04] <sunbeam> how can i check if no $('.something') is displayed?
[08:18:11] <sunbeam> (so it can be hidden)
[08:18:29] <fast1k> it print [object Object] error
[08:18:30] <aro> sunbeam: if ( $('.something').is(':visible') )
[08:18:32] <fast1k> no more
[08:19:22] <averyquery> sunbeam: selector.is(':visible')
[08:19:43] <sunbeam> thanks
[08:19:46] <codacoder> @aro: what was your issue again?
[08:20:02] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/barrychapman/TZWp3/24/
[08:20:08] <aro> it selects the 'select' elements too
[08:21:10] <fast1k> aro: actual code http://pastebin.com/11t48mGk
[08:21:43] <fast1k> $(this).attr('data-tip', 'Loading... beforetest'); didnt work too :S
[08:21:52] <aro> oh
[08:21:54] <aro> fast1k
[08:22:00] <aro> you are missing a { after the .each(function())
[08:22:02] <JD-Robbs> Okay, I found the problem. I have this: for (k in result.messages) ... Now, using jQuery only, this will not be iterated if messages.length === 0... However, if mootools is included too, then it STILL iterates if it is an empty array... Anyone know how this is possible? Thank you! :)
[08:22:07] <aro> never mind
[08:22:08] <aro> you arent
[08:22:18] <aro> missed it
[08:22:33] <sunbeam> If people always load their javascript files at the bottom of a HTML file, what happens if you need to use jquery before ? (within the HTML) in <script> // some code </script> ?
[08:22:46] <aro> do you work at blizzard or something
[08:22:52] <fast1k> nope xD
[08:22:56] <fast1k> i have a wow server
[08:23:11] <aro> cool
[08:23:13] <aro> i used to play wow
[08:23:23] <aro> havent played the new pack tho
[08:23:34] <codacoder> @aro: so, $(v).find('input[required="required"]') is doing $(v).find('input[required="required"], select') in effect?
[08:23:36] <aro> wotlk was the one that opened northrend right?
[08:23:41] <fast1k> i have wotlk :)
[08:23:42] <aro> codacoder: yes
[08:23:44] <fast1k> yep
[08:24:06] <codacoder> sheesh
[08:24:13] <kelye> any ideas on how to change the offset.top of a draggable element ?
[08:24:31] <kelye> .offset( {top: ..}) is not working
[08:24:32] <JD-Robbs> WTF! I do for(blah in blahhhh) and mootools changes blah to "$family".... HEADACHE :(
[08:25:10] <kelye> and  $(this).data('draggable').offset.top (inside start: function() ) not working either
[08:25:29] <sunbeam> If people always load their javascript files at the bottom of a HTML file, what happens if you need to use jquery before ? (within the HTML) in <script> // some code </script> ?
[08:25:58] <kelye> it throws an exception
[08:25:58] <aro> then you are snookered
[08:26:02] <anew> anyone using bootstrap carosel to load images?  how can i preload like 10 images in the carosel ?
[08:26:05] <kelye> or such
[08:26:06] <goose1> aro: why do you think it selects select objcets?
[08:26:24] <codacoder> yeah, what goose1 said ;)
[08:26:26] <goose1> aro: you do console.log(v) when v = the previous div
[08:26:37] <aro> goose1: my guess would be that they are input elements
[08:27:04] <goose1> aro: v is still pointing to div
[08:27:14] <aro> goose1: you are missing the point, its doing the console.log EVEN IF the find(input[...]) evaluated to be true
[08:27:33] <codacoder> it aint true
[08:27:41] <codacoder> it "exists" as a jQ object
[08:27:51] <aro> no
[08:27:57] <codacoder> yes
[08:28:06] <aro> $(v).find('input[required="required"]')
[08:28:24] <codacoder> I'm listening...
[08:28:36] <aro> that is evaluating to be true
[08:28:47] <codacoder> truthy, yes
[08:28:48] <goose1> aro: it still points to the the OLD v refernece.
[08:29:04] <codacoder> but not true as in "do you exist"
[08:29:13] <aro> okay, so what should i be doing
[08:29:41] <codacoder> that jQ obj will be built regardless of whether it found anything
[08:29:51] <codacoder> you may want to add .length to it
[08:29:58] <aro> oh.
[08:30:01] <aro> hang on
[08:30:06] <codacoder> to see if it actually contains any element(s)
[08:30:16] <aro> shit
[08:30:18] <aro> i thought i had that
[08:30:47] <aro> now it works :)
[08:31:04] <relipse> i have a fax number with 3 input boxes, how do I automatically have it go to the next box when done entering the first 2
[08:31:09] <codacoder> :) :) :)
[08:32:08] <codacoder> @relipse: document flow order should do that for you
[08:32:26] <relipse> ?
[08:32:41] <relipse> i think the client wants it to automatically jump to next box when done inputing
[08:32:45] <codacoder> you (normally) shouldn't need to write code to specifically do that
[08:33:05] <codacoder> define "done inputing"
[08:33:17] <relipse> 555 <jump=to-next-box>
[08:33:20] <relipse> 1212
[08:33:58] <codacoder> if you have three input type="text" tab should take you to each successively
[08:35:19] <goose1> aro: your whole syntax is weird i am surprised it works. check: http://jsfiddle.net/kRWnH/1/
[08:35:47] <gnarf> relipse: so, its just genrally bad UX to have that in 3 input boxes
[08:35:59] <gnarf> people put in all sorts of stuff for phone numbers
[08:36:05] <gnarf> also, think about non-US #'s
[08:36:10] <gnarf> etc
[08:36:10] <codacoder> goose1/aro: agreed. it's a bit "wordy"
[08:36:30] <gnarf> relipse: also, almost every time one of those forms exists, it annoys me as a user
[08:36:47] <codacoder> gnarf: agreed
[08:36:57] <aro> goose1: come again?
[08:37:04] <aro> i just alerted that crap to see if it was working
[08:37:13] <aro> it is much more elegant on the site :)
[08:37:39] <codacoder> aro: oh, ok... what we're seeing is a bit... you know... klunky looking ;)
[08:37:43] <aro> it is
[08:37:45] <aro> trust me
[08:37:45] <aro> :)
[08:37:54] <aro> thats just my down and dirty test case
[08:38:00] <codacoder> sure
[08:38:19] <aro> the actual site is https://www.quizzle.com/create-account
[08:38:20] <goose1> also btw selecters are read from right to left
[08:39:16] <goose1> so going extra specific is not needed
[08:46:11] <macabre> i'm having a brain fart moment and i need help with a basic question. i have a modal pop up with json data requested from the server. i would like to email the data thats already been loaded inside my div - how would i accomplish this?
[08:48:00] <Assimilater> REALLY SIMPLE question, almost feel silly for asking it. Can someone refresh my memory on dynamic list creation syntax? I can't remember...http://pastebin.com/f2ukkekV
[08:50:28] <codacoder> As*: does that parse?
[08:51:01] <codacoder> ?
[08:52:01] <relipse> I understand all your concerns but this is a client request, he wants it so when you finish typing it jumps to the next box wtihout having to press "tab"
[08:52:03] <Assimilater> codacoder: oh that was at me? no it didn't like var sData = {};
[08:52:08] <relipse> like social security number
[08:52:23] <relipse> does anyone know how to do this?
[08:52:25] <Assimilater> let me pull up the exact error again (commented out so i can keep working)
[08:52:29] <relipse> i'm guessin i can use maxlength property
[08:52:29] <sunbeam> with a .click() event I am adding a new datepicker input field. However, datepicker popup does not work then, any idea how I can fix this?
[08:52:35] <codacoder> yeah, i'm lazy
[08:52:38] <heedly> Why does thise work in fiddle but not my browser: http://jsfiddle.net/YkDbD/
[08:52:57] <Assimilater> codacoder: sytnax error: invalid object initializer
[08:53:11] <zfly9> hey guys, can someone give me some pointers on where to start with something like the black bar at the top of this website (with the red box)
[08:53:13] <zfly9> https://mahifx.com/
[08:54:00] <Assimilater> codacoder: oh wait, i'm an idiot, that error's on line 4 not 1
[08:54:30] <codacoder> relipse: convince him he's wrong.  The "world" understands how a web form works... changing it is NOT good practice
[08:54:47] <codacoder> 2nd thing... the code you DONT write is the code that doesn't break
[08:55:03] <codacoder> and doesn't need to be maintained
[08:56:12] <codacoder> As*: yeah, that's not a proper object definition
[08:56:39] <Assimilater> codacoder: yes, that's my question, what is the proper way to increase the element
[08:57:08] <codacoder> As*: by "increase" you mean add one? to what?
[08:57:57] <Assimilater> codacoder: well the attempt is to generate a list of search parameters to be passed through $.ajax using the post method
[08:58:20] <Assimilater> codacoder: so this sData is meant to gather all those values (dynamic number of search parameters)
[08:58:24] <codacoder> you're building an oject - it's purpose is immaterial
[08:58:42] <codacoder> I just need to understand what you're trying to build there
[08:58:48] <Assimilater> codacoder: well, adding an element to the object
[08:59:07] <codacoder> ah
[08:59:22] <lejocelyn_> I'm not sure of the syntax
[08:59:29] <codacoder> sDate = { property : value }
[08:59:30] <lejocelyn_> is $(".delWebsites").click(delWebsite()); ok ?
[08:59:46] <lejocelyn_> I mean, delWebsite() is a function I define before
[08:59:47] <Assimilater> codacoder: but that will erase perviously added elements, will it not?
[08:59:56] <codacoder> sData.property2 = otherValue;
[09:00:12] <rocky> is it possible to trigger custom events on custom objects? (ie non-dom elements)
[09:00:25] <codacoder> sData.property3 = somethingelse;
[09:00:39] <Assimilater> codacoder: i see, /me tests
[09:02:09] <Assimilater> codacoder: ah, I see, thanks
[09:04:14] <xckpd7_> question: let's say I'm looking at a button on a page, and when I click on it, something happens on the page. is there anything I could do in a modern browser to track down where that came from?
[09:04:39] <Assimilater> codacoder: oh, forgot to mention, these property names also need to be dynamic
[09:05:02] <codacoder> As*: not a problem
[09:05:28] <Assimilater> codacoder: sData.name doesn't grab the variable name's value
[09:05:30] <codacoder> sData["dynamicthing"] = value;
[09:06:03] <Assimilater> codacoder: ok, hopefully i'm done emberassing myself now :)
[09:06:09] <codacoder> it *looks* as though you're talking to an array... but it aint
[09:07:13] <codacoder> As*: do you use dev tools... like firebug perhaps?
[09:07:23] <Assimilater> codacoder: I use firebug heavily
[09:07:30] <codacoder> right...
[09:08:12] <codacoder> mess around with predefined objects (window, for example)... type window["alert"] in the watch pane
[09:08:55] <codacoder> you know window is an object, yet its properties can be addressed just as though they were "array like"
[09:09:04] <codacoder> same is true for your stuff too
[09:09:14] <codacoder> you'll learn a lot that way
[09:09:58] <Assimilater> codacoder: good point-out, thanks
[09:10:04] <codacoder> np
[09:13:15] <codacoder> xck*: where what came from? the click?
[09:13:19] <spobat> #
[09:13:28] <spobat> why doesn't this do it immediately?
[09:13:29] <spobat> img.fadeOut(0, function () {
[09:13:35] <spobat> it still fades in like 400 ms
[09:13:39] <spobat> or, maybe 100ms
[09:13:57] <xckpd7> codacoder: yeah so like a click handler is bound to an element. I just want a way to track things down
[09:14:19] <codacoder> google visual event 2
[09:15:08] <codacoder> not sure it will help, but maybe
[09:17:06] <lejocelyn_> In this context, how can I reach the <ul> ? http://jsfiddle.net/Srnq8/3/
[09:17:24] <lejocelyn_> prev(".add") doesn't work
[09:17:31] <lejocelyn_> closest neither :(
[09:18:40] <codacoder> lej*: what context exactly?
[09:19:44] <lejocelyn_> codacoder: there are siblings
[09:19:55] <lejocelyn_> I mean, same level
[09:20:06] <lejocelyn_> I can't get to reach them with closest or prev
[09:20:08] <Andrew_R> jqueryui autocomplete doesn't reposition itself if it goes off page (the form goes all the way to the bottom)
[09:20:33] <Andrew_R> is there a way to make it popup above the input box?
[09:20:40] <codacoder> lej*: cant advise over what I can't see...
[09:21:04] <codacoder> if you have the outer div, then just $("ul") would work
[09:21:37] <lejocelyn_> I'd like to reach them with the button actually codacoder
[09:21:46] <codacoder> if you have the input, then .parent().parent()
[09:21:58] <lejocelyn_> when I click, add a li or remove one
[09:22:07] <lejocelyn_> depending on the button
[09:22:21] <codacoder> .parent().find("ul") ?
[09:22:32] <yedi> how come this doesn't work as expected?: https://gist.github.com/yedi/5285934
[09:22:35] <yedi> highest's value isn't persisting
[09:23:36] <masentinel900> Guys!! definitely I continue getting this error when use datepicker ui  ::  insActive is undefined
[09:24:17] <lejocelyn_> codacoder: ah, yes
[09:24:19] <lejocelyn_> thanks
[09:24:20] <masentinel900> Someone know why happens this?
[09:25:59] <codacoder> lej*: np.  I'd try not to use find though.  Perhaps give the ul an id?
[09:30:19] <lejocelyn_> codacoder: I can't as I have a lot of them
[09:30:49] <codacoder> sure
[09:31:07] <lejocelyn_> but then, if I do that $(this).parent().find('.add').first("li").clone();
[09:31:29] <lejocelyn_> why would it clone the ul class=add ?
[09:31:36] <lejocelyn_> I just want to clone the li
[09:31:37] <lejocelyn_> :(
[09:32:00] <codacoder> I'd just do an append
[09:32:07] <codacoder> and write it long hand
[09:33:02] <lejocelyn_> I must clone it as this button works for different inputs
[09:33:23] <lejocelyn_> so I have to copy the current li which contains the input
[09:34:13] <lejocelyn_> I do append the clone
[09:34:49] <codacoder> $(".add").append("<li><input type="text" name="websites" /></li>")
[09:35:15] <codacoder> I sense I'm missing your point but that looks ok to me
[09:35:40] <codacoder> (fix the quotes though!)
[09:37:03] <lejocelyn_> codacoder: it's a class...
[09:37:14] <lejocelyn_> It would append to a lot of different input
[09:37:21] <lejocelyn_> different lists
[09:37:34] <lejocelyn_> I'd like just to the current (this) one
[09:37:35] <codacoder> $($(".add")[0]) ...
[09:37:50] <systemfault> Don't do that :/
[09:37:57] <codacoder> well, you'd have it in a var right? use that...
[09:37:59] <systemfault> $(".add").eq(0)
[09:38:18] <lejocelyn_> eq ? I look for that in the api
[09:39:01] <systemfault> [0], like .get(0) give an DOM Node and not a jQuery object.
[09:39:25] <lejocelyn_> hum, sounds good
[09:39:32] <codacoder> it's wrapped in $()
[09:40:01] <codacoder> but still, if you have the element from the find in a var, use that
[09:40:20] <codacoder> that is a jQ object
[09:42:22] <xckpd7> codacoder: visual event 2 did help, thanks. I would be interested if there were any other ways though too.... I'll google em
[09:42:26] <xckpd7> codacoder: thanks though
[09:42:48] <xckpd7> codacoder: It did show me the exact file that was binding the click event
[09:42:54] <codacoder> it did or did NOT help?
[09:43:16] <defaultro> hey folks, any great tutorials links regarding jquery mobile?
[09:44:12] <codacoder> xck*: ah.... cool
[09:45:22] <rocky> anyone have a suggestion on a good jquery-compatible workflow and/or state-machine js library?
[09:51:37] <monk12> hello all, just curious if there is a way to re-write this function that uses windows.onload to be jquery document.ready: http:/pastebin.com/F5CvanPr
[09:52:58] <monk12> Its a library for cross-site forgery attacks that automatically injects a csrf token into the form on the page ... but i have a feeling with the windows.onload, its not workign correctly ... like If i press the form button fast enough before the token is loaded into the form, then its viewed as an attack...
[09:53:32] <lejocelyn_> when I create a function $(".mybutton").click(function(){}, when is it applied to the document?
[09:53:40] <lejocelyn_> at the end of the page loading?
[09:53:50] <monk12> i thought windows.load() would occur after all DOM anddd images loaded but not yet displayed on the user's browser?
[09:54:56] <lejocelyn_> I've got an ajax function that populates a list. After populating that list, I create a jquery click event that can delete an element of that list
[09:55:05] <lejocelyn_> the $(".mybutton").click(function(){}
[09:55:07] <monk12> lejocelyn_: you might want to put that in a document.ready $(function(){  ...your code to happen when DOM loads... });
[09:55:15] <lejocelyn_> ok
[09:55:21] <lejocelyn_> example ?
[09:55:37] <systemfault> monk12: load is pretty much the last thing happening.. it's triggered after all the images are loaded
[09:56:27] <monk12> systemfault: Could the windows.load event still be happening while page/imges presented to the user in their browser?
[09:56:44] <lejocelyn_> monk12: it's not really when the document is ready, it's after a specific function has been executed
[09:57:13] <systemfault> monk12: It happens when EVERYTHING is loaded.
[09:57:34] <systemfault> That includes images.
[09:57:43] <monk12> systemfault: so by loaded, its in their browser at that point?...
[09:57:50] <systemfault> Yeah..
[09:58:06] <systemfault> That event happens too late for most applications..
[09:58:15] <monk12> i guess that would explain issue then... the page is loaded and then onload runs... the csrf token is not appllied yet to the form, and user quickly presses Next on form.
[09:58:22] <monk12> one sec lejocelyn_ ...
[09:58:46] <monk12> and fails the csrf check :(
[09:58:53] <systemfault> So a "DOMContentLoaded" event was created… With jQuery, you need to do $(function() { code here  }); or $(document).ready(function(){ code here});
[09:59:48] <monk12> lejocelyn_: is the button always there that triggers the event... or is it returned dynamically with the ajax request (like a Delete button for each row in returned html)
[10:00:52] <lejocelyn_> monk12: returned dynamically
[10:00:59] <hugo_moss> can anybody recommend a jquery ajax pagination plugin?
[10:01:20] <lejocelyn_> actually, I just thought of add this function to the success part of the ajax
[10:02:14] <monk12> lejocelyn_: there a few ways to do it then... the problem with doing the usal way via $(function(){ $('somebutton').click(function(){ ... }); }) is it only applies to things currently on the page... if you want to have it dynamically attach to new things coming into the page in the future... u can  do something like this...
[10:03:33] <monk12> $('#table_container').on('click','.somebutton', function(e) { ... }); There's a few ways to do it in older jqueries as well. research the on( function
[10:04:18] <monk12> also live(
[10:04:42] <lejocelyn_> what about doing it at the success time of the ajax ?
[10:05:08] <lejocelyn_> I mean, the success option of $.ajax()
[10:05:54] <monk12> Try it out... I guess you could re-run the same rule. but i like just having it separate and covering all cases, current and future.
[10:07:09] <lejocelyn_> ajax inside ajax :(
[10:07:16] <lejocelyn_> doesn't look like working
[10:07:49] <dersand> If the data of the post() method for jquery is { name: "John", time: "2pm" }. Does that mean that name and time is $_POST['name'] and $_POST['time']?
[10:07:56] <dersand> in php
[10:08:45] <Andrew_R> dersand: yes that is correct
[10:10:02] <monk12> try looking on on( function ... live( is depreciated but probably easier to use.
[10:10:15] <monk12> lejocelyn_: ^
[10:10:44] <dersand> Why was the toggle  function depreciated?
[10:12:24] <Andrew_R> .toggle() is not depreciated
[10:13:03] <Woet> how can I use .abort() in combination with .load?
[10:13:55] <pachet> dersand, Andrew_R: .toggle(fn1, fn2) is deprecated as a signature
[10:14:02] <pachet> dersand: to your question, see
[10:14:05] <milovan> hi, can jquery ui 1.7.x work with jquery 1.5.2?
[10:14:08] <pachet> ?g this hover cruft is full of ills

[10:14:39] <dersand> what the actual quack pachet
[10:15:18] <lejocelyn_> monk12: what is the e in function(e) ? $('#table_container').on('click','.somebutton', function(e) { ... });
[10:15:30] <pachet> lejocelyn_: it's the standardized event object
[10:15:46] <pachet> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[10:15:50] <lejocelyn_> thank you
[10:16:38] <monk12> yah... I just have it there in case need access to it. i usually keep my things prefilled with everything available in return functions just in case need to use it later.
[10:17:10] <Andrew_R> pachet: correct, toggle() is not depreciated ? see toggle
[10:17:19] <Andrew_R> but "toggle-event" is ? see toggle-event
[10:17:22] <Andrew_R> hmm
[10:17:26] <pachet> what
[10:17:35] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:17:42] <Andrew_R> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[10:18:11] <monk12> lejocelyn_: (the e, event object in the code i sent^)
[10:18:36] <Andrew_R> (I don't know, that's just the way they have the documentation formatted)
[10:18:40] <pachet> oh, yeah
[10:19:05] <lejocelyn_> ok
[10:19:22] <lejocelyn_> sometime, Firebug makes javascript buggy
[10:19:25] <zapsoda> On this site http://bm2dev.com/natchez.org/membership/test-page/ before the slider is done loading how would i hide the images? I tried setting display none and then triggerin the jquery .show() method but that doesnt work, Any ideas
[10:19:35] <milovan> Can jquery ui 1.7.x work with jquery 1.5.2 or only withh jquery 1.3.2?
[10:20:42] <huma> can i define my own parser for ajax jsonp call?
[10:20:57] <systemfault> parser?
[10:21:28] <huma> yes, jquery chokes on returned js
[10:22:00] <pachet> :[
[10:22:02] <systemfault> No, you can't do anything as JSONP is javascript
[10:22:58] <systemfault> Fix your backend ;)
[10:23:24] <aro> THATS WHAT SHE SAID
[10:23:38] <pachet> hrm
[10:23:45] <xckpd7> aro: jeez

[10:25:42] <shadyKhan> is this the correct syntax if ($("#page.productlist-page").is('*')) {
[10:25:50] <shadyKhan> for seeing if an element exists on page?
[10:26:05] <systemfault> shadyKhan: .length > 0
[10:30:50] <lejocelyn_> do you guys use firebug or something else ?
[10:30:58] <lejocelyn_> available on Linux please :)
[10:31:27] <Andrew_R> firebug
[10:31:52] <systemfault> I use the chrome dev tools :P
[10:31:55] <zfly9> Anyone know a way to use jQuery cycle (http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/) and have two areas transition rather than the default one area?
[10:32:10] <aro> whut
[10:32:20] <zfly9> aro me?
[10:32:32] <lejocelyn_> Andrew_R: did you notice some bugs with Firebug ? like when you put a stop point on certain places, it would make some functions not work?
[10:32:53] <aro> yeah
[10:32:55] <aro> u
[10:33:43] <Andrew_R> lejocelyn_: occasionally I have. I am using jqGrid in my project, and if I set a breakpoint in where it loads the data through ajax, it wont load properly
[10:33:50] <zfly9> Basically they have the regular image transitioning to the next, can I call another area to transition as well. say if I wanted a description of the image in a separate area to transition with the image
[10:34:03] <lejocelyn_> jqGrid, I take a look
[10:34:09] <lejocelyn_> Andrew_R: same here for the ajax
[10:35:11] <Andrew_R> most of the time it works fine for me to break into code that calls ajax
[10:36:18] <zfly9> aro ^
[10:36:45] <zfly9> aro, basically two slideshows, with one 'pager' nav
[10:36:50] <aro> ok
[10:36:56] <aro> so two instances of the cycle?
[10:37:08] <zfly9> aro, basically, but they share the nav
[10:37:30] <aro> hmm, do you have a website as an example of what you are doing
[10:38:36] <zfly9> aro, might have found it http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/pager-double.html
[10:39:19] <lejocelyn_> monk12: can't I pass this argument to a success function in £.ajax ? http://fpaste.org/xdwk/
[10:39:25] <lejocelyn_> $.ajax :)
[10:39:32] <lejocelyn_> I'm not English ;)
[10:39:40] <monk12> oh whoops, maybe i used another event that had that argument
[10:40:04] <zfly9> aro, might be tough using this though since I have two different divs, have to use different ID's
[10:40:15] <shoky> lejocelyn_:  place isn't a jquery object and it's not in the DOM anyway so you can't remove anything about it
[10:40:42] <aro> i see
[10:42:01] <lejocelyn_> shoky: ah ok, I though "this" would be a jquery object
[10:42:24] <shoky> lejocelyn_: oh i didn't notice the 'var place' on top
[10:42:33] <shoky> lejocelyn_: but you named your argument to the success callback 'place' also
[10:42:36] <ladislaw> i need to slide a page from left into view on click, how do i do it?
[10:43:17] <shoky> lejocelyn_:  change the name of the var or of the argument,  and "this" isn't a jquery object , it's a DOM element
[10:43:47] <lejocelyn_> shoky:  but then, how I pass that place to the function ?
[10:43:59] <shoky> lejocelyn_:  you don't need to pass it, it's already in scope
[10:44:50] <lejocelyn_> ah yes
[10:44:58] <shoky> lejocelyn_: http://fpaste.org/jx4Z/
[10:45:02] <lejocelyn_> but how you I pass a value then ?
[10:45:34] <shoky> what value
[10:45:41] <shoky> pass from where to where
[10:46:01] <shoky> success function argument is the response from the server
[10:46:06] <ladislaw> anyone?
[10:46:23] <Underflow> does anyone know how to disable caching for ajax json request to Google Feed API ?
[10:47:04] <zfly9> aro, http://jsfiddle.net/pcgSP/ I'd like the red box to change with the top conetn
[10:47:07] <zfly9> content
[10:55:43] <zfly9> Hey guys, using jQuery cycle http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/, trying to get two areas to transition per the one nav http://jsfiddle.net/pcgSP/... Anyway to get the red box area to transition as well?
[11:00:02] <Croves> How do I properly check if a input text is empty?
[11:00:26] <aro> Croves: if ( $('input').val().length ) { not empty }
[11:00:37] <aro> zfly9: i still am not sure what you are trying to do
[11:00:50] <Croves> aro: Oh, of course! I was checking if ($('input').text() == '')
[11:00:54] <aro> :)
[11:01:02] <Croves> Thanks :P
[11:01:10] <aro> np
[11:01:34] <zfly9> aro, did you see the jsfiddle? just trying to have the area in the red box that says "1 experience" to change with the content that is changing at the top
[11:01:51] <aro> so you are trying to transition two separate divs on cycle
[11:02:04] <zfly9> yup!
[11:02:05] <aro> ?
[11:02:06] <aro> ok
[11:02:08] <aro> use callbacks
[11:02:19] <gordian> i'm using Bootstrap with scrollspy and it works great, but if my anchors scroll horizontally then it doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/AzSWV/2/
[11:02:22] <aro> and do it manually
[11:02:36] <gordian> if you remove the comments in the CSS you'll see the body scrolls horizontally
[11:02:40] <gordian> but the scrollspy doesn't work
[11:02:49] <shoky> zfly9: put the red box as part of the slides?
[11:03:03] <shoky> also.. it'd help if there was something to transition TO
[11:03:16] <gordian> if anyone can help me get the scrollspy working horizontally that would be much appreciated
[11:03:16] <zfly9> shoky, I know it would help, haven't set that up yet
[11:03:40] <aro> zfly9: can you use callbacks?
[11:03:58] <zfly9> aro, not sure, pretty new to js/jQ
[11:04:17] <aro> okay
[11:04:19] <aro> hang on
[11:07:31] <aro> zfly9: what are you trying to hide in addition to what is being done
[11:07:45] <zfly9> aro huh?
[11:08:16] <aro> zfly9: what are you trying to cycle
[11:09:21] <aro> i cant tell what is what
[11:10:13] <zfly9> aro, sorry I don't have the content in there
[11:10:15] <zfly9> to swap
[11:10:19] <zfly9> hold on one sec
[11:10:26] <aro> well that helps a ton
[11:11:53] <zfly9> aro, well bascially the #highlighted box, I would just duplicate 10 times and change the content
[11:12:23] <shoky> zfly9 why not put the red box in the slides?
[11:12:36] <zfly9> shoky, might have to result to that
[11:14:43] <shoky> e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/pcgSP/4/
[11:16:03] <zfly9> aro, here http://jsfiddle.net/pcgSP/5/
[11:16:58] <zfly9> shoky
[11:17:06] <zfly9> yeah I think that's the easiest route
[11:17:07] <zfly9> thanks bud
[11:17:19] <maxwell_> what can i do here in order to decrease the total when removing a row http://jsfiddle.net/f9yww/6/
[11:22:28] <jost> Is there a simple, cross-browser way to check if the mouse pointer is currently hovering over an element?
[11:23:04] <jost> is(':hover'); is out, of course.
[11:24:33] <systemfault> mouseenter/mouseleave and a boolean could do it I guess..
[11:25:28] <freannrak> this sounds really stupid, but I'm having trouble seeing console.log('output') in chrome's dev tools. http://dpaste.de/3XURh/ - only thing I see in dev tools console is line 86's console.log, but line 85's one doesn't print.
[11:25:32] <jost> systemfault: hmm... does that work if the mouse is initially over the hover area?
[11:25:38] <systemfault> Something like myElement.on('mouseenter mouseleave', function(e) {  $(this).data('hovered', e.type == 'mouseenter');   });
[11:25:45] <systemfault> jost: Not 100% sure
[11:25:58] <jost> I'll give it a try
[11:31:17] <shoky> freannrak: reproduce it in a jsfiddle
[11:32:18] <freannrak> shoky: already figure it out, turns out someone had added a duplicate .js file in the project and I blindly opened it :(.
[11:32:23] <freannrak> shoky: thanks anyway.
[11:32:30] <relipse> anyone use jquery validate?
[11:37:25] <relipse> anyone know how to say "Area Code is required" rather than "This field is required"
[11:37:37] <relipse> in jquery validate plugin
[11:40:54] <shoky> relipse you can use the messages option
[11:45:01] <monk12> Yeh relipse: can always just google something like "jquery validate custom message" and find this on top 10 results: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6777634/jquery-validation-plugin-custom-message or the documentation
[11:45:35] <shoky> or, god forbid, go through the docs
[11:49:43] <wenzhixue> I have a question, how to go back to the pervious page and go to the same position.
[11:50:14] <wenzhixue> on linkedin, when you click a row in company list, it will have http://www.linkedin.com/company/2689148?goback=%2Efcs_GLHD_face_false_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2&trk=ncsrch_hits
[11:50:55] <wenzhixue> but this goback parameter is on this url, how come when i click goback button on boswer.. it read that line?
[11:55:07] <Shoutsid> Guys, I have a search functionality with some Jquery/JS that will end up querying the database after  4 words are pressed in the search field. But I've noticed this is impractical and could end up with an easy ddos affect. Any suggestions
[11:58:45] <shoky> Shoutsid: that has nothin to do with ddos. you can use a setTimeout or a throttle/debounce plugin to not send a request too often
[11:59:30] <pachet> yeah, anyone that tries to DDOS you using a form that doesnt throttle input doesnt know what they're doing
[11:59:33] <Cluber> [{"message": "Please enter all form fields.", "error": true}] - How do i get about parsing this with a $.post()
[11:59:40] <pachet> when you can write scripts to wget x 1000's of times a second
[12:00:10] <pachet> Shoutsid: typically those work by having each keypress clear and reset a timeout
[12:00:24] <pachet> so it effectively becomes <interval> ms after the last keypress that the request is sent
[12:01:46] <Cluber> This doesn't seem to parse the json "[{"message": "Please enter all form fields.", "error": true}]" - http://jsfiddle.net/gVKAv/ - I get undefined for my alert.
[12:02:15] <Shoutsid> pachet: shoky: Thank you for the advise.
[12:05:12] <Shoutsid> shoky: this is what I have at the moment (coffeescript) https://gist.github.com/shoutsid/5286933
[12:08:04] <Shoutsid> Should  just be updating the posts with a timeout like i have for my delete?
[12:14:51] <shoky> Shoutsid: you should clearTimeout the current timeout (if there is one) on keyup
[12:15:09] <shoky> otherwise you'll still have the same number of requests, just delayed
[12:16:30] <freannrak> I need to modify this jQuery plugin to create a new template each time addButton is clicked. With my limited jQuery knowledge I'm having hard time understanding how to do it. Any pointers would be appriciated http://dpaste.de/i4d58/
[12:17:05] <Shoutsid> shoky: So i will be clearing a timeout, then setting a new one, on every keyup? :)
[12:17:15] <aro> can you select based on attributes?
[12:17:16] <Shoutsid> Would make sense.
[12:17:27] <shoky> Shoutsid: pretty much
[12:17:31] <aro> like $('input[placeholder="first-name"]').whatever()
[12:17:36] <Shoutsid> shoky: Thank you.
[12:17:42] <shoky> aro: yes
[12:17:46] <aro> sweet
[12:17:47] <aro> thanks
[12:28:07] <DukeDrake> hi
[12:28:44] <DukeDrake> is it possible to change the appearance of a <button> to 'clicked', without actually clicking it?
[12:31:19] <rmill> DukeDrake, appearance?
[12:31:31] <rmill> You can trigger it via .trigger, or .click
[12:31:42] <rmill> If you want to change the appearance, you could use a css class
[12:31:43] <DukeDrake> yes. Make the button look like it's being clicked
[12:31:58] <raj> is there different css for jqui's .button()?
[12:32:04] <DukeDrake> yes ... but I'd like to use the browsers default appearance
[12:32:06] <rmill> then, just .addClass('clicked');
[12:32:20] <shoky> you can't do it with the native button
[12:32:34] <DukeDrake> hmmm
[12:34:09] <shoky> raj: whucha mean?
[12:35:41] <raj> the current css/graphics .button() offers doesn't have an obvious active state vs hover
[12:35:49] <masentinel900> Guys could help me with the instalation of datapicker ui of jquery?
[12:35:50] <masentinel900> Plz
[12:36:59] <shoky> raj: sure it does
[12:37:18] <alaing> masentinel900: whats up?
[12:37:51] <brombomb-w> Is there a better way to implment "handles" that don't block hover controls built in to jquery ui menu
[12:37:52] <brombomb-w> http://jsfiddle.net/brombomb/rn4rB/
[12:38:22] <masentinel900> alaing: When I going to onclick on my input text tag load somethings in the console but doesn't show me the calendar
[12:38:36] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me what the last "-" in this regex means: /[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/
[12:38:54] <ezrafree> oh wait that means it also allows the "_" symbol itself, right?
[12:38:56] <shoky> raj: there's .ui-button  and for diff states:  .ui-state-default , .ui-state-hover  and .ui-state-active
[12:38:58] <brombomb-w> allow the 'dash' character
[12:38:58] <alaing> masentinel900: what browser are you using?
[12:39:04] <ezrafree> brombomb-w: awesome, thanks

[12:39:15] <Jesse_> Hi
[12:39:28] <alaing> masentinel900: coudl you create a jfiddle.net?
[12:40:08] <alaing> masentinel900: what version of the ui and firefox? Have you tried another browser like IE or Chrome?
[12:40:28] <shoky> masentinel900: you don't need to include a seperate datepicker.js
[12:40:35] <shoky> or .css
[12:41:12] <alaing> masentinel900: yeah as shoky says
[12:41:58] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/xUEnU/
[12:42:27] <masentinel900> Mozilla 19.0.2
[12:43:32] <alaing> masentinel900: you cant use php in a jsfiddle
[12:43:43] <Jesse_> can you guys advise me about if I should submit a bug report? I am using Opera 12.14 and getting an error from jquery about invalid value for property zoom useage in jquery 1.7.2 and also in 1.9.1
[12:44:02] <masentinel900> Is that like this I have my script
[12:44:31] <Jesse_> I see that there is an open issue about zoom on webkit.
[12:44:45] <tumulte> hey
[12:44:56] * tw2113 points at shoky 
[12:45:04] <tw2113> this guy, is pretty trustworthy
[12:45:19] <alaing> masentinel900: I've updated it to include your verison of jquery and ui
[12:45:20] <aep> hey, with jquery-mobile, how can i generate a listview at runtime?  $('<ul/>', { 'data-role' : 'listview' ... doesn't work
[12:45:25] <alaing> masentinel900: http://jsfiddle.net/xUEnU/1/
[12:45:35] <shoky> tw2113 nice april fools joke
[12:45:36] <tumulte> I got a problem getting the files selected in a multiple input field. $(this).files gives nothing
[12:45:52] <tw2113> oh yeah, it's April Fools day
[12:45:54] <alaing> masentinel900: could you just paste the html that your php produces into the html section of that and then update it
[12:46:02] <tw2113> forgot that part
[12:46:17] <raj> shoky, k, but active doesn't look like a button that has been pressed down to me
[12:46:31] <masentinel900> Yes, But which php?
[12:46:34] <raj> the way a regular <button> element looks when the mouse is clicked over it
[12:46:37] <raj> that truly looks pressed
[12:48:19] <alaing> masentinel900: basically just couple the html that your php creates......in the html section of the jsfiddle you have php in there....
[12:49:04] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/73WGB/
[12:49:08] <masentinel900> Like this?
[12:49:53] <Jesse_> I am also seeing warnings about box-sizing...
[12:50:39] <Jesse_> Am I in the right place?
[12:51:49] <shoky> raj: welp there are many themes.. and you can find a few more on google. or add css to your liking
[12:52:46] <Brixius> Is there a way to select items from a multiselect listbox based on a partial value, ie I have a listbox full of city names and I want to remove all of them that end in 'HI' like thinking something like $('#select option[value="*, HI"]'
[12:53:22] <alaing_> masentinel900: so for id =datepicker i would get rid of the id
[12:54:09] <tumulte> is there a difference between getElementByID('truc') and $('truc') ? Namely, whey the first works with .files, and not the last ?
[12:55:25] <brombomb-w> $('#truc')
[12:55:34] <brombomb-w> the second uses a css selector
[12:55:43] <alaing_> tumulte: yes getElementByID('truc') is native JS to find an element with an ID of truc. $('#truc')  is the jquery version of that statement
[12:55:52] <brombomb-w> so you can select classes with .truc or an id with #truc
[12:56:24] <Brixius> tumulte: I believe the last one returns a jquery object, not the js element. (I asked the same question once.)
[12:56:26] <masentinel900> alaing_: Already I have changed that id for follow bad
[12:56:56] <alaing> tumulte: yes getElementByID('truc') is native JS to find an element with an ID of truc. $('#truc')  is the jquery version of that statement
[12:57:03] <alaing> masentinel900: Firstly, you dont have valid html......you cant have more than one element with the same id
[12:57:10] <alaing> masentinel900: so for id =datepicker i would get rid of the id
[12:57:50] <tumulte> ok... isn't that too ugly to mix both syntax ?
[12:58:09] <masentinel900> Ok, But show me this error:  ::  $(...).zIndex is not defined
[12:58:28] <Jesse_> http://jsbin.com/odafoz/1/
[12:58:50] <alaing> masentinel900: chaneg the id attribute to class
[12:58:59] <alaing> masentinel900: and then try $('.datePicker").datepicker();
[12:59:30] <alaing> tumulte: that is ugly and tbh I would just use jquery version if you using jquery
[12:59:54] <alaing> because then you can chain together methods
[13:00:03] <alaing> and use the power of the jquery
[13:00:21] <tumulte> alaing: any way to get "files" from jquery then ?
[13:00:44] <masentinel900> Already I changed it but show me the same error log
[13:00:57] <alaing> tumulte: can you explain what you mean by "file", are you referring to ajax?
[13:01:33] <masentinel900> But those there are the required files?
[13:01:40] <masentinel900> Or I need to add more files
[13:02:25] <alaing> masentinel900: can you do an updated jsfiddle.net?
[13:02:54] <masentinel900> http://jsfiddle.net/mRGN5/
[13:03:27] <tumulte> alaing: this : http://davidwalsh.name/multiple-file-upload
[13:04:56] <alaing> tumulte: oh i see you trying to upload multiple files to your server
[13:05:51] <tumulte> alaing: indeed. I'd like to display the name of the files before submit
[13:05:52] <alaing> tumulte: that plugin is not using jquery but native js
[13:06:02] <tumulte> that's where the js becomes useful
[13:06:28] <tumulte> alaing: you mean jquery has nothing to handle that ?
[13:06:30] <Shoutsid> shoky: it still seems to just delay the search, but it has queued events to fire O.o
[13:06:30] <alaing> tumulte: what browser do you have to support?
[13:07:36] <tumulte> alaing: modern browsers
[13:08:28] <alaing> tumulte: no I mean that example/blog does not use jquery. Are you trying to create a jquery version of that?
[13:09:16] <tumulte> alaing: I just want ti list the files selected in the input. I can mix both syntax, but I'd rather use a jquery equivalent
[13:09:18] <alaing> tumulte: you might even find other jquery plugins like plupload
[13:09:30] <Croves> Guys, I'm trying to use the Datepicker Widget from jQuery UI. I'm doing this: $('#input').datepicker({ altFormat: "dd/mm/yy" }); I need to get the date in format 'day/month/year (01/04/2013), but it's not working
[13:09:42] <Croves> It returns '04/01/2013'
[13:09:54] <Jesse_> have a good day everyone. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13707
[13:11:01] <tumulte> alaing: I basicpluploadally just want to reproduce this part : input.files[x].name
[13:11:32] <tumulte> the rest of it is handled
[13:12:21] <raj> shoky, can I make this look better? and look standard in all major browsers? http://jsfiddle.net/Xpfge/
[13:12:57] <aro> raj
[13:13:00] <aro> what are you doing
[13:13:16] <aro> whats your question
[13:13:34] <alaing> tumulte: ok.
[13:13:50] <raj> aro, trying to make a button have an active state
[13:13:59] <raj> ..to make it look like it's in its active state
[13:14:08] <shoky> raj: no ;] unless you have a seperate css for each major browser, with css hacks
[13:14:13] <raj> i want it to look like a regular button when you push down over it, without letting go of the click
[13:14:20] <raj> oh damn
[13:14:26] <shoky> thought we've been through this :P
[13:14:40] <shoky> gtg, bbl
[13:14:46] <raj> kk, bye
[13:15:05] <dwarder> why this "message = $("#something"); message.center();" tells me: uncaught typeerror: object [object object] has no method 'center'
[13:15:31] <alaing> tumulte: the files is an attribute of type="file"
[13:15:53] <JFranks> $(selector).effect('highlight'); has an easing on it that 'bounces'.. So if you run the cursor over a series of these and then click one, the bounce easing plays out on the most recently hovered-over item.. So while the click goes to the right spot, the visual feedback is that you clicked on the wrong object?
[13:19:21] <alaing> tumulte: so if you upload file element is call foo it youw be something like  $('#foo').prop('files')
[13:20:46] <tumulte> alaing: This is the answer I was looking for
[13:20:55] <tumulte> I've never heard of this prop so far
[13:20:58] <tumulte> Thanks a lot !
[13:21:01] <tumulte> Flying away
[13:21:33] <alaing> yeah if think files is concidered a property instead of attribute
[13:30:01] <masentinel900> Guys!!
[13:30:08] <masentinel900> This is line good   ::   $("input[type=text].field-form-proy1").click(function(){
[13:30:57] <tw2113> seems like an overly specific selector unless you have input types that share that same class
[13:32:08] <SimplySeth> is there a seperate room for jqgrid ?
[13:45:16] <ezrafree> SimplySeth: i doubt it, plugins generally don't set up their own specific channel
[13:45:43] <Pizentios> hi there, i have a website that uses jquery that runs a function on a button click, however under iOS 6 devices the click event doesn't seem to get triggered, i have also tried tap, touchstart and touchend with no success. Can somebody give me some hints on how to get things working with iOS 6? works just fine from android devices and regular computers.....
[13:47:15] <SimplySeth> displays 0 results ... http://dpaste.org/cZbYR/ <--- first attempt at jqgrid
[13:54:37] <masentinel900> Guys!!, Someone know how to chnge the style to datepicker jquery?
[13:55:34] <raj> what's a 'less button' ?
[13:55:39] <raj> in terms of css or something
[13:57:18] <maxwell_> masentinel900: what do you want to change?
[13:58:00] <masentinel900> Is that on the web page it shows good size, But when I goint to open it from my page the size is a bit big
[13:58:26] <masentinel900> And also I want to change it the color of caprion
[13:58:30] <masentinel900> caption*
[13:58:31] <Gazpacho> raj: it's a button that hides part of a large element
[13:58:45] <pachet> raj: http://lesscss.org/ presumably?
[13:58:51] <pachet> oh haha
[13:58:53] <maxwell_> masentinel900:  sometimes it depends on the font you have on your own page so the datepicker will resize to that font
[13:59:38] <pachet> masentinel900 your questions always start out so urgent
[13:59:38] <maxwell_> masentinel900:  for the caption you will have to change .ui-widget-header
[14:00:28] <masentinel900> <pachet>: Why?
[14:01:02] <ezrafree> masentinel900: you can also pick a theme from jqueryui.com
[14:03:36] <masentinel900> If I choose a theme from jquery and then I have downloaded, I just should to change this file  jquery-ui-1.10.2.custom
[14:03:41] <masentinel900> "jquery-ui-1.10.2.custom.js"
[14:08:49] <shoky> HI
[14:10:18] <maxwell_> hi there
[14:10:50] <mith1> hello
[14:11:23] <mith1> i have an issue can ne1 help me?
[14:11:32] <pachet> ask and ye shall maybe receive
[14:15:48] <mith1> ok i have a site http://www.con-cor.com/sitemap224.htm  problem is using nivoslider the slider is on top out of view to the left of the page but on reload on firefox it is correctly positioned
[14:19:10] <dokma> I have a div and a label and input=text inside and a function gets called with div as the param e
[14:19:22] <dokma> I need to copy value of label into the input
[14:19:32] <dokma> is that done with .find ?
[14:30:53] <shoky> dokma: .find finds descendant elements, yes
[14:31:33] <raj> pachet, yeah, so that's some custom css file?
[14:33:40] <shoky> raj: he just told you what 'less' might be referring to, no?
[14:34:27] <raj> shoky, yeah, he's rigt
[14:34:29] <raj> *right
[14:35:17] <shoky> welp, less isn't "some custom css file", or donno what you mean
[14:35:32] <ohcibi> anyone has an idea why the submitHandler is fired when the first input is focused, its not empty and enter is pressed? http://jsfiddle.net/qgAT4/3/
[14:36:10] <BryanRuiz> anyone got any suggestions on how to build a similar toggle slider as on www.Nike.com homepage?
[14:36:34] <pachet> raj: i think whoever it was with the other answer was right
[14:36:40] <pachet> a less button being a button that shows less of something
[14:36:46] <Shoutsid> When clearing a timeout will that stop the function firing (no matter what) ?  because this > https://gist.github.com/shoutsid/5287366 Seems to delay like i want it too, but once the delay is over. it will fire multiple times, even though i have cleared the timeout.
[14:37:38] <raj> pachet, not what I meant
[14:38:22] <pachet> Shoutsid: you're passing a function reference to clearTimeout
[14:38:34] <pachet> just simply the cruft
[14:38:52] <pachet> store a variable in your outer closure that's the guaranteed timer for any settimeout you assign
[14:39:00] <pachet> any time you reassign it, or want to clear it, clear that variable
[14:39:12] <Shoutsid> i have done :/
[14:39:18] <pachet> s/simply/simplify
[14:39:31] <pachet>  return clearTimeout(delaySearch);
[14:39:33] <pachet> no bueno
[14:40:30] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: you have called clearTimeout on the function you are calling inside your timeout.. what you want to do ist var timer = setTimeout(...) and then clearTimeout(timer);
[14:40:50] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: clearTimeout doesnt care what functions you are calling inside your timeout callbacks
[14:41:22] <darkfrog> is there any way to make a <input> fire a change event when text is dragged into the field and then blurred?
[14:41:33] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: also as your actually only calling one function inside your callback you could pass this function directly, setTimeout(yourFunction, 1000);
[14:41:57] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: note the missing brackets when passing the function as an argument
[14:41:57] <Shoutsid> I have done the latter of what you said. It made no difference.
[14:42:18] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: the latter isnt solving your problem, its just simplifying your code
[14:42:48] <Shoutsid> Let me try read what you said until I understand it, because for some reason it's not clicking :P
[14:42:51] <Shoutsid> Thanks though!
[14:43:09] <shoky> Shoutsid:  you call clearTimeout and pass it a timeout ID, not a function
[14:43:16] <shoky> i mean, that's what you should do.
[14:43:26] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: setTimeout is returning a reference to a timer, you have to clear this very timer and not the function youre calling inside your timeout
[14:43:26] <shoky> a timeout ID is returned by setTimeout
[14:44:25] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: http://jsfiddle.net/atMJK/
[14:45:03] <Killswitch> Hello, I am new to creating plugins and I have a variable set in the plugin, and then a setTimeout() that will update that variable but it's not working, any idea what I could be doing wrong?
[14:45:31] <shoky> `demo @ Killswitch
[14:45:32] <Killswitch> var myVar = true; setTimeout(function() { myVar = false; }, 300); console.log(myVar);
[14:45:32] <b-ot> Killswitch: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:45:47] <shoky> Killswitch: the console.log needs to be in the setTimeout callback
[14:45:51] <Killswitch> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/Killswitch/Lwgsg/
[14:45:56] <Killswitch> The project I am working on
[14:46:33] <Killswitch> shoky: the console.log is just so I can see what the var is after the setTimeout changes it.
[14:46:42] <Killswitch> But it's not changing it
[14:46:53] <shoky> Killswitch:  the stuff you put after the setTimeout call  is executed BEFORE the setTimeout callback is called
[14:47:16] <Killswitch> So I put it before it?
[14:47:26] <shoky> inside
[14:47:28] <ohcibi> Killswitch: i guess youre wondering why if(AdBlockDetected) doesnt returns what you've expected, in this case read what shoky said.. you set the callback to execute the function after ms time, but the code isnt paused after setTimeout is called
[14:47:51] <pachet> welcome to the desert
[14:47:55] <pachet> of the asynchronous
[14:48:01] <ohcibi> true
[14:48:43] <Killswitch> Ah thanks
[14:48:47] <Killswitch> It all works
[14:51:03] <raj> shoky, are you a fan of LESS?
[14:51:54] <aep> any built in filter language to filter objects according to their properties?
[14:52:15] <ohcibi> aep: afaik jquery doesnt have anything builtin.. try underscore
[14:52:23] <Shoutsid> so how can i start the timer if it's only a variable O.o omg i should have learnt javascript a bloody long time ago
[14:52:47] <raj> aep, what properties?
[14:52:57] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: i posted you an example... the timer is started when calling setTimeout, so far so good. . your problem was on clearing it.. and you clear it by calling clearTimeout on the return value of setTimeout
[14:53:32] <aep> mostly looking for text queries, so users can supply them
[14:53:37] <aep> raj: i guess.. any
[14:53:43] <shoky> raj: i think it has its uses, and it can simplify some stuff in your css, but i'm comfortable enough with CSS to be able to make CSS that i'm happy with, so i haven't really felt a need for using it
[14:54:08] <shoky> raj: but i used it on one project (they were already using it) and it was nice
[14:54:30] <shoky> raj: honestly i haven't used it much other than that project so i don't have a strong opinion either way
[14:54:33] <pachet> hey dawg i heard you like scripting
[14:54:44] <pachet> so i put scripting in your styles --- etc
[14:54:50] <shoky> aye
[14:54:54] <aep> i guess i can use underscore with jsondecode
[14:54:59] <Andrew_R> raj: I am planning on starting to use LESS very soon
[14:55:07] <ohcibi> aep: basically its something like collection.filter(function(item) { item.property1 == "value" && item.property2 == "value2 }); where underscore has a shortcut method for
[14:55:42] <raj> i feel it may be overkill for me to use twitter bootstrap just to have button states
[14:55:57] <raj> I'm just not content with the look of http://jsfiddle.net/Xpfge/2/
[14:56:00] <aep> ohcibi: apparantly underscore lacks something like "greater than"
[14:56:14] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: well that example you gave me produces the same results as what it used too >.<
[14:56:54] <ohcibi> aep: you're maybe  right... file a feature request 8-)
[14:57:08] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: post a working example on js fiddle
[14:57:47] <Andrew_R> raj: maybe something like http://jqueryui.com/button/#radio ?
[14:57:49] <ohcibi> aep: but maybe you could combine underscores find method with an additional filter()?
[14:58:10] <Andrew_R> or http://jqueryui.com/button/#checkbox
[14:58:13] <raj> Andrew_R, didn't like that either
[14:58:42] <Andrew_R> well, you can style it however you want
[14:59:14] <raj> i'm aware
[14:59:18] <raj> it's the styling I have trouble with
[14:59:36] <raj> I just can't make things pretty with css
[15:01:35] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: I can do better
[15:02:55] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: checkout the pm
[15:03:49] <shoky> raj you can always copy css.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Xpfge/3/
[15:04:46] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Xpfge/4/
[15:05:14] <raj> holy crap, that's sexy
[15:05:38] <shoky> it's bootstrap
[15:06:08] <raj> meaning it doesn't work for which IE?
[15:06:14] <sonotos> yes
[15:06:17] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: dont pm me... i'm not the only one in here who has done a little jquery so far
[15:06:28] <shoky> raj: should work fine in IE i think. doesn't bootstrap?
[15:06:43] <Shoutsid> http://4hv4.localtunnel.com/examples/search
[15:06:49] <shoky> well, the box-shadow won't work in old IE
[15:06:55] <raj> says "modern browsers"
[15:07:47] <maxwell_> what can i do here in order to decrease the total when removing a row http://jsfiddle.net/f9yww/6/
[15:09:51] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: okay this is an example.. but whats the problem now 8-))... i said post on jsfiddle... its better because youre able to create a simple small example that shows exactly your problem and nothing else (and often you solve that problem yourself during creating such an example)
[15:10:22] <shoky> raj: for IE<9 you'd need images i think
[15:10:26] <shoky> to make it look the same
[15:10:45] <raj> god
[15:10:47] <raj> life is hard
[15:11:22] <shoky> if you care about people with old browsers and want them to see box-shadows.. yes
[15:11:32] <shoky> for the rest of us life is grand ;p
[15:11:36] <Shoutsid> I never used jsfiddle, due to me sucking. I don;t know how I would put an example because i'm using javascript partials to re-render the page etc etc... but the problem is that the delay works but after the delay, it fires multiple times.
[15:12:32] <raj> and radius
[15:12:50] <shoky> yes
[15:13:19] <raj> doesn't look terrible without boxshadows
[15:14:10] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: https://gist.github.com/ohcibi/5288207
[15:17:23] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: read again what was said many times already: clearTimeout wants the return value of setTimeout to work properly.. you werent passing the return value of setTimeout, in fact you have never stored this return value so clearTimeout was unable to know what you actually want
[15:18:28] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: this doesnt affect the function of setTimeout itself, as it doesnt cares if it gets cleared or not, or if its return value gets stored
[15:20:57] <maxwell_> =/
[15:22:14] <raj> shoky, will that be overriding any of these lines in my normalize.css? http://paste.ofcode.org/8XayHYMJMUfh3ke2fWMNVU
[15:24:03] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: I think i understand, to an extent. To you it might be simple but it's taking a while to stick
[15:24:37] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: Thank you for all your help, sorry if you had to repeat yourself many times.
[15:25:40] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: you should decrease the timeout time to somewhat around 300-500 ms btw...
[15:26:20] <Shoutsid> Yeah i know, was a larger time due to testing. Wanted to see the affect of the delay
[15:26:44] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: you should also clear the ajax call btw
[15:27:16] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: same principle.. store the request in a var, abort that var if its not already aborted or null before starting a new request
[15:27:23] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of any online form builders built in jquery?
[15:28:17] <ohcibi> Shoutsid: because once the timeout has fired there could still be a delay until the request is processed, the effect you want to avoid could happen in this time if you dont cancel your request the same way you did with the timeout itself
[15:37:42] <shoky> maxwell_: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/f9yww/7/
[15:39:32] <Shoutsid> ohcibi: like this? https://gist.github.com/shoutsid/5287366
[15:39:58] <maxwell_> thanks shoky u are always saving my life
[15:40:34] <shoky> ;]
[15:40:53] <raj> he's a f'ing ninja
[15:41:16] <gordian> shoky is a wonder
[15:42:10] <ner0x> What's the standard way of waiting a few seconds before hiding an element?
[15:42:21] <maxwell_> i need 500 years of jquery to get those skills
[15:42:38] <raj> he's like gandhi mixed with linus torvalds
[15:42:59] <raj> mixed with john resig
[15:43:32] <aghouseh> trying to get jquery to play nice with magento, and it works somewhat, but when I'm trying to call a plugin inside my jquery(document).ready(function(){ $('.flexslider').flexSlider(); }); and its not available
[15:43:40] <shoky> you're all very sweet, but it's after midnight here so april fools is already over!
[15:43:45] <shoky> you can stop!
[15:45:49] <shoky> don't stop!
[15:46:46] <raj> an ode to shoky
[15:46:58] <raj> hip hip hooray!
[15:47:05] <maxwell_> lol
[15:48:02] * shoky twinkles
[15:48:28] <raj> shoky, will you speak at my first sons bar-mitzvah?
[15:49:26] <shoky> why, your gf's a joo?
[15:49:41] <shoky> i didn't even speak at my own bar-mitzvah
[15:49:46] <shoky> in fact i didn't even have one
[15:50:10] <shoky> wuz a rebel
[15:50:43] <raj> oh, then my child won't have one either
[15:50:49] <shoky> yay
[15:50:59] <shoky> you can still circumsize him
[15:51:03] <raj> lmao
[15:52:20] <aep> is there a storage abstraction api? i dont want to deal with the differences of browsers and just store some basic stuff
[15:52:28] <maxwell_> take him the hood off
[15:53:09] <shoky> all your hoods are belong to jehovah
[15:55:34] <shoky> aep there's store.js, donno how good it is
[15:55:53] <shoky> but seems legit
[15:57:29] <fast1k> hi
[15:58:08] <raj> hi
[15:58:23] <draginx> How do I get sortable to revert back to the original position after an AJAX call?
[15:58:35] <draginx> I've tried $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel'); but no luck and same with $(ui.item).sortable('cancel');
[16:02:11] <shoky> draginx: you need to store the original order, if i get you right
[16:02:19] <draginx> Yeah well..
[16:02:28] <draginx> sortable cant just place the item back where it was originally found? :/
[16:03:37] <shoky> you're talking about one item?
[16:03:52] <draginx> yeah
[16:03:58] <draginx> also receive: function() never works :/
[16:04:29] <shoky> you have a connected sortable?
[16:05:16] <draginx> yes
[16:05:21] <draginx> I mean tehcnically multiple
[16:05:27] <draginx> I'd like to connect multiple <table class="items">
[16:05:45] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[16:13:39] <draginx> cant jsfiddle
[16:13:48] <draginx> to much privacy policy violations fuck
[16:15:50] <draginx> shoky: here http://jsfiddle.net/yG2tN/
[16:16:05] <draginx> ofc it works here
[16:25:53] <shoky> draginx: and calling the cancel method works in your fiddle too. for 'stop' you can use $this.sortable('cancel')  and for receive you'd need $(ui.sender).sortable('cancel')
[16:26:09] <draginx> shoky: it works when its not in the .done() of an ajax call
[16:26:12] <draginx> which is strange
[16:26:21] <draginx> even if I set a variable to var sender = $(ui.sender);
[16:26:28] <shoky> well, to my surprise it does work
[16:27:27] <draginx> whats weird is.. sender.__proto__ is [0]
[16:27:50] <shoky> draginx: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/yG2tN/1/
[16:28:35] <draginx> ah! in stop it's $this :) ok thanks man!
[16:32:44] <Phoenixz> On jQuery Mobile, I need a full page width panel.. How do I do this? I've checked http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0/docs/examples/panels/panel-styling.html, it says it will explain how to change width, but it does not show much about it I think :) Anybody who knows?
[16:34:21] <coldhead> d
[16:36:09] <nick_omega> This code will switch the display attribute but not switch the graphic or allow me to click it a second time to activate the function in the elseif.  Hoping there's someone who can detect any errors at http://jsfiddle.net/BhtwE/
[16:42:24] <Andrew_R> nick_omega: after you click the button, the .menu1 div is positioned over the top of the button
[16:42:30] <Andrew_R> so it can't be clicked
[16:43:30] <coldhead> nick_omega: i'd rewrite it thusly to make it easier to debug http://jsfiddle.net/BhtwE/1/
[16:45:02] <nmeum> Is it just me or is .serialize() ignore inputs of the type file?
[16:45:43] <coldhead> i wouldn't expect them to be serialized, no telling what's in them
[16:46:44] <nick_omega> coldhead: excellent, thanks
[16:47:27] <nick_omega> next issue is that on the first click after loading the page, the img changes but the display attribute does not switch, after that it toggles alright
[16:49:01] <nick_omega> Andrew_R I'm wondering if coldhead's code resolved the issue you spoke of
[16:50:54] <aMoniker_> Is there anyone clever in here?
[16:51:30] <coldhead> is there anyone clever ANYWHERE or are we just food for the moon?
[16:51:36] <nmeum> oh, you can't upload files using ajax? ;_;
[16:51:59] <aMoniker_> coldhead: lunachow
[16:52:12] <coldhead> nmeum: that's why there are beloved projects like https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[16:53:06] <aMoniker_> coldhead: If you knew the line number of an html file, could you derive a jQuery object containing any elements from it?
[16:53:39] <aMoniker_> within the context of the entire document
[16:53:49] <coldhead> god no, that would be very difficult
[16:53:56] <coldhead> and it's pretty much my first day using jquery
[16:54:02] <coldhead> interesting problem though
[16:54:04] <aMoniker_> that's why I asked for clever people!
[16:54:08] <aMoniker_> yes
[16:54:58] <tw2113> just use selectors like ids or classes or whatever else
[16:55:09] <tw2113> not trying to accurately pinpoint a line number
[16:55:25] <aMoniker_> tw2113: no, for this I'd need to take a file, and a line number
[16:55:38] <aMoniker_> tw2113: then return a selector in the document context for any valid elements on that line
[16:55:52] <tw2113> o.O
[16:56:55] <coldhead> hard road
[16:57:19] <nmeum> coldhead: thank you, sir :3
[17:00:19] <ner0x> What's the easiest way to see if something is hidden?
[17:01:18] <aMoniker_> ner0x: is that a buddhist koan?
[17:01:40] <coldhead> $('thing').is(':hidden')
[17:02:04] <ner0x> coldhead: Ah, easy enough. Thanks. I'll peek at the docs.
[17:02:05] <Andrew_R> aMoniker_: can you do something like data.split(/\r\n/)[lineNumber] ?
[17:02:08] <tw2113> stop showing your thing to everyone coldhead
[17:02:49] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: sure, but then how do I get whatever is on that line in the context of the entire file?
[17:02:54] <coldhead> i'm not showing, i'm inviting them to see that it's hidden
[17:03:03] <coldhead> securely under a fig leaf
[17:03:37] * tw2113 wonders what part it was stapled to
[17:03:39] <Andrew_R> aMoniker_: I'm not clear on exactly what you are trying to do.
[17:04:36] <tw2113> best i can tell, aMoniker_ wants to traverse a file
[17:04:40] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: So, take an arbitrary HTML file. Given a line number of the file, return a jQuery object containing any valid elements on that line
[17:04:55] <Andrew_R> valid elements might span multiple lines
[17:05:01] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: they might
[17:05:26] <tw2113> keeping line numbers consistent and predictable would be a bitch
[17:09:27] <Wolfed> I know this is jquery/jquery-ui support, but does anyone have any knowledge on jqPlot by any chance? Documentation seems a bit awful.
[17:11:51] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: brain on fire yet?
[17:13:11] <wagtag> How do I detect if an autostarting html5 video is playing?
[17:18:52] <nick_omega> i load the page firstly and click the down arrow, it changes to an up arrow (but div still hidden).  i click the new up arrow and then everything toggles as planned after that.  not sure why it doesn't toggle properly from the first click: http://jsfiddle.net/BhtwE/2/
[17:22:34] <gordian> nick_omega: your fiddle is arsed up
[17:22:46] <Andrew_R> aMoniker_: jQuery doesn't know/care about line numbers
[17:23:58] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: I know, but I do.
[17:24:06] <gordian> aMoniker_: yikes
[17:24:15] <aMoniker_> gordian: tough one, eh?
[17:24:25] <gordian> last time i worried about line numbers was learning BASIC
[17:24:31] <gordian> haha
[17:24:31] <coldhead> hahahah
[17:24:35] <gordian> if this then goto 4
[17:24:39] <gordian> hahaha
[17:24:50] <aMoniker_> gordian: well, perhaps you can untangle this knot
[17:25:00] <aMoniker_> gordian: take an arbitrary HTML file. Given a line number of the file, return a jQuery object containing any valid elements on that line
[17:25:10] <Andrew_R> aMoniker_: tells us why you need the line number
[17:25:15] <Andrew_R> *tell
[17:25:23] <coldhead> aMoniker_: you already saw http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2044642/finding-out-what-line-number-an-element-in-the-dom-occurs-on-in-javascript ?
[17:25:26] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: assume I do - it's a requirement
[17:25:59] <aMoniker_> coldhead: yes, but that works in reverse and is not a complete solution
[17:26:20] <coldhead> ur not a complete solution, pal
[17:26:27] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[17:26:28] <gordian> aMoniker_: did you try the new "chat with an expert" feature on stackoverflow?
[17:26:38] <gordian> ;-)
[17:26:41] <aMoniker_> gordian: I guess I'm not chatting with one now, eh?
[17:26:47] <coldhead> how rude
[17:26:56] <Andrew_R> ok I can't help, I was thinking maybe we could come up with a better solution to meet your requirements, but apparently not
[17:27:07] <aMoniker_> Andrew_R: for this, it would be a requirement
[17:28:01] <gordian> aMoniker_: this isn't #experts-only
[17:28:08] <aMoniker_> gordian: clearly ;)
[17:28:09] <gordian> people come here to help each other… for free
[17:28:33] <gordian> maybe you can head over to #bad-attitudes-for-no-reason-dont-get-help
[17:28:37] <coldhead> for free?! I'VE BEEN PAYING YOU PEOPLE
[17:28:42] <gordian> hehe
[17:28:48] <aMoniker_> gordian: looks like a hit a nerve
[17:28:49] <nick_omega> i load the page firstly and click the down arrow, it changes to an up arrow (but div still hidden).  i click the new up arrow and then everything toggles as planned after that.  not sure why it doesn't toggle properly from the first click: http://jsfiddle.net/BhtwE/2/
[17:28:53] <bet0x> Hello all!
[17:29:29] <gordian> i'll say you hit a nerve: nobody likes a troll
[17:29:48] <gordian> nick_omega: fix your fiddle please!
[17:30:06] <coldhead> quit fishing for nerves
[17:30:07] <aMoniker_> gordian: relax, it's a hard problem to solve
[17:30:20] <coldhead> alt. /quit fishing for nerves
[17:30:56] <gordian> i have no interest in helping you so its level of difficulty is moot
[17:31:06] <gordian> ciao~!
[17:31:19] <aMoniker_> gordian: later knothead :)
[17:34:04] <nick_omega> gordian: i resolved it... thanks.
[17:34:37] <nick_omega> the original issue that is
[17:34:41] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a 5 minute break
[17:35:08] <gordian> definitely
[17:37:05] <Stephen> Hi
[17:37:21] <Stephen> I'm fresh in, happy to dive into help
[17:37:50] <Stephen> If you have a summary, msg me right quick so we don't frustrate those who have been at it a while
[17:56:03] <garbagecollectio> do query .html save as text
[17:56:10] <garbagecollectio> capture newlines
[18:02:03] <raj> shoky, wherever you got that css from before, is there a hover definition as well?
[18:02:13] <raj> cuz it looks/works great
[18:02:20] <raj> just wanted the hover styling as well
[18:02:40] <raj> also, what's button:active ?
[18:05:16] <raj> and button:focus, if that's a thing too
[18:08:45] <raj> or whatever other states there are
[18:12:17] <gordian> raj: those are css pseudo selectors
[18:18:56] <raj> gordian, but is active an actual pseudo-selector for a button?
[18:19:03] <raj> I thought buttons don't have an active state?
[18:19:09] <bet0x> how i do write the value of a textarea inside a input?
[18:19:24] <bet0x> http://jsfiddle.net/JV2qW/102/ this for example isn't working
[18:19:39] <bet0x> if i do write a title i get my slug but for textarea doesn't work!
[18:20:47] <gordian> bet0x: seems to work for me
[18:21:12] <bet0x> weird thing isn't working with me o.O
[18:21:35] <shoky> raj: yeah, it's here http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#buttons
[18:21:48] <shoky> just took the styles from the default button
[18:21:56] <raj> gotcha
[18:22:06] <raj> shoky, but buttons don't have active states, right?
[18:22:10] <raj> so what is :active about?
[18:22:30] <shoky> raj: it's while they're being clicked
[18:22:30] <Smashcat> Hi, is there a way to access attributes an an element that triggered a click event handler? i.e. I can get the id with "event.target.id". Obviously I could get the elementById and then get the attribute, but is it available without doing that?
[18:23:26] <raj> oh
[18:24:03] <raj> so why can't I get ahold of the :active state from traditional buttons?
[18:24:03] <Smashcat> Ah never mind, go it...
[18:24:30] <coldhead> buttons? i thought you said butterflies
[18:24:51] <raj> traditional = native
[18:24:51] <bet0x> gordian why this not work at my website?
[18:25:49] <shoky> raj besides the css :active psuedoselector i donno a way to "get ahold" of it
[18:26:25] <raj> i mean, why can't I steal the css code from what the browser uses for button:active?
[18:26:39] <raj> out of curiosity
[18:26:55] <raj> i actually like the twit buttons you showed me better anyway
[18:27:06] <shoky> well.. it's not a question of why
[18:27:08] <shoky> it's a question of how
[18:27:12] <shoky> and i dont know the answer ;P
[18:27:20] <shoky> but you knew that :P
[18:28:33] <shoky> raj: and also i dont know if anyone said that it had to be css
[18:28:40] <shoky> the browser can draw whatever it wants on an active button
[18:29:11] <shoky> and if it were css, nobody said it's cross-browser css
[18:29:25] <shoky> it's most likely not
[18:29:56] <shoky> for example, i see chrome has this for native buttons:  button {  -webkit-appearance: button;  }
[18:30:04] <shoky> wouldn't help you to use that
[18:30:05] <Stephen> If you are interested in doing crazy things with button implementations, look up x-node
[18:30:13] <Stephen> or shadow dom implementations
[18:31:55] <Stephen> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/
[18:33:12] <Stephen> I can't wait until someone implements a seamless iframe inside a button re-implemented with the Web Components API
[18:42:32] <raj> shoky, I'm considering switching to bootstrap, but i'm wondering how much work it'll take to redo my current css then
[18:43:38] <shoky> raj: no idea, i've never used it
[19:23:37] <RayHerring> i have a table on my webpage which is 'border=0', however when a person hovers over a row in that table, i want that row to get a border put around it
[19:23:55] <RayHerring> however the border isn't working, and i'm guessing because i have the table set 'border=0'
[19:25:31] <Smashcat> RayHerring: The TR element can't display a border. You can set the background color on it, and also set any TD's in the TR to have a border
[19:26:25] <RayHerring> ahh, hrmm
[19:26:39] <Kriz1> RayHerring, if you are clever with the css borders you can add borders to the td's that look like its on the tr by removing the left and right borders except for the first and list, if you know what i mean :P
[19:26:51] <Kriz1> first and last*
[19:26:59] <RayHerring> that shouldn't be too difficult
[19:27:12] <Kriz1> :first-of-type and :last-of-type should help u alot
[19:27:18] <Kriz1> u could do it like this
[19:27:36] <Kriz1> tr:hover > td:first-of-type { border-left: solid 1px black; }
[19:31:40] <RayHerring> oooh, nuts
[19:32:50] <Kriz1> RayHerring, :P yah...it can get a bit hairy
[19:32:57] <Kriz1> but its fun once u understand how it works etc
[19:33:41] <RayHerring> not that
[19:33:49] <RayHerring> the first-of-type was added 1.9
[19:34:12] <RayHerring> i'm still using 1.7 because one of the plugins i use for jQuery apparently has issues on IE when i use anything higher
[19:34:50] <RayHerring> i'll just use first-child and last-child
[19:37:48] <RayHerring> and that works perfectly, sweet
[19:52:24] <b-lew> any reason why this shows the objects superbox.append(sliderData); and this doesn't? superbox.append('<div class="description">' + sliderData + '</div>');

[20:39:38] <kelye> any idea how can I set the offset of a draggable element ?
[20:40:01] <kelye> $(this).data('draggable').offset.top = X .. not working
[20:41:08] <coldhead> suuuuuper: did you see this already http://www.electrictoolbox.com/running-javascript-functions-after-disqus-loaded/ ?
[20:41:55] <suuuuuper> coldhead yea but disqus updated their code. from that site: Update for Disqus 2012 (June 15th 2012) The disqus_config() function is still called, and the callbacks object still exists, but setting them to a function does not appear to do anything with the recently upgrade to Disqus called Disqus 2012.  Therefore, the rest of the content in this post is probably no longer relevent.
[20:42:01] <rideh> flot vs d3 vs chart vs ???  thoughts?
[20:42:17] <rideh> going to be using for dashboard type reporting / chart tools
[20:44:04] <L1> Hi, how can I include myLiElement in this selector? $('li', myLiElement) ?    So I want all child LIs of myElement, but I want myLiElement to be included in the results as well
[20:45:10] <coldhead> rideh: i like flot because their documentation used to a be text file
[20:45:15] <coldhead> but they've gone all fancy and html now
[20:45:39] <coldhead> L1: $(myLiElement).find('li').andSelf();
[20:45:57] <coldhead> sorry suuuuuper, it's a shame they dumped that
[20:46:39] <coldhead> suuuuuper: antonkovalyov used to work at disqus. he's @valueof on twitter if you want to ask, he might know
[20:47:49] <L1> coldhead: Thank you, I didn't know about addSelf. Looks deprecated now - new function is addBack()
[20:48:09] <suuuuuper> coldhead: thanks ill look into it
[20:48:17] <rideh> coldhead: thanks, i briefly used flot, was easy to get up and going. have you head any issues with memory?
[20:49:39] <coldhead> no issues to report, rideh, and we were using a dozen or so charts
[20:49:49] <rideh> great thanks
[20:49:50] <coldhead> but i suppose it depends how large your data sets are
[20:50:34] <rideh> coldhead: nothing too extreme, i dont think i'll really run into many problems there. thanks
[20:51:09] <coldhead> L1: thanks for the update!
[20:59:05] <coldhead> the roots and the ruins are the same thing
[21:18:26] <Aristata> Is it possible to support placeholders in ie without the placeholder appearing as dots?
[21:19:22] <Aristata> And without a hack to have the label hover over the input?
[21:23:57] <coldhead> hesitation's elegy
[21:26:28] <raj> in the fewest characters possible, how can I ensure an ev.target from a click handler is a 'button' or find the closest 'button' upwards?
[21:27:05] <shoky> RrRrRrraj
[21:27:09] <Aristata> Pretty sure there is an e.srcElement or something
[21:27:18] <raj> so `var $button = $(ev.target).is('button') ? $(ev.target) : $(ev.target).closest('button')
[21:27:31] <shoky> why you usin ev.target instead of this ?
[21:27:40] <raj> not sure, I always use ev.target
[21:27:48] <raj> is this better?
[21:29:00] <shoky> yeah, for
[21:29:02] <shoky> er, yeah
[21:29:20] <raj> why?
[21:29:21] <shoky> ev.target will get you the actual element clicked
[21:29:44] <shoky> this (or ev.currentTarget)  wil get you the element you set the click handler on
[21:29:44] <raj> omg, and `this` will be the element i'm listening for?
[21:29:53] <raj> OMFG
[21:30:03] <raj> i've been doing that "closest" trick for hte longest time!
[21:30:09] <shoky> ;p
[21:30:14] <raj> i just thought i'd ask to see if there's a shorter way to do it!
[21:30:29] <raj> ican'tbelievethis
[21:30:41] <shoky> LoL
[21:31:15] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[21:31:23] <mike_f> Good evening.
[21:31:56] <mike_f> (I suppose it's morning over in Europe)
[21:31:57] <raj> coldhead, how so?
[21:32:51] <shoky> raj btw  even with .closest() i think it also checks the specified element (not just its parents)
[21:33:08] <shoky> so  $button = $(ev.target).closest('button');  would also work
[21:33:10] <raj> oh, good to know
[21:33:44] <coldhead> ya closest() starts with the current element
[21:33:48] <coldhead> it's very considerate like that
[21:34:10] <raj> that is pretty considerate
[21:34:12] <coldhead> sometimes the thing we're looking for is the thing that's been with us all along

[21:47:55] <dotstormz> hi, i'm trying to target a parent div class of a label. Doing $(this).parents('div.item'); is buggy and doesn't just return the div.item element for that label, it also grabs any others
[21:48:16] <dotstormz> what's the best way to get the parent element of a click event without doing .parent().parent() etc. ?
[21:48:33] <coldhead> .closest('div.item')
[21:48:37] <coldhead> ?closest
[21:48:47] <coldhead> oh great so we have NO bots
[21:48:50] <dotstormz> i'll give it a shot
[21:48:51] * coldhead rages
[21:50:20] <dotstormz> no same dif.... multiple elements ae being highlighted
[21:50:29] <dotstormz> coldhead: can i pastebin it for you to take a quick look?
[21:50:41] <coldhead> put it on jsfiddle
[21:50:46] <coldhead> working demos are winning demos
[21:56:06] <dotstormz> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/GGVA4/
[21:57:09] <dotstormz> when i click any item in saturdy it also messes with fridays
[21:57:20] <coldhead> weekends are hard
[22:01:26] <dotstormz> coldhead: any ideas?
[22:01:37] <coldhead> no sir
[22:01:53] <coldhead> some of the closing tags are showing up in jsfiddle as red
[22:01:59] <coldhead> which makes me wonder if the html is invalid
[22:02:16] <dotstormz> could be i'll have a look now
[22:02:24] <dotstormz> probably because i cut half of it out to create a demo :P
[22:03:21] <dotstormz> syntax is fine in firefox source view (hightlights errors in red)
[22:05:26] <coldhead> dotstormz: it's calling the handler twice
[22:09:50] <coldhead> dotstormz: this seems to work better http://jsfiddle.net/GGVA4/1/
[22:09:56] <coldhead> i changed the on() to use delegation

[22:54:58] <NoOova> Hello all
[22:55:11] <NoOova> could i perform lazy elements selecting?
[22:55:22] <NoOova> in accessing time, not in query time
[22:55:48] <NoOova> like $('.class', parentElement, deffered=true)
[22:56:17] <Cork> NoOova: not in a selector, but what is it you're tying to do?
[22:56:41] <NoOova> i want to access actual dom all the time
[22:56:48] <NoOova> in some parent selector
[22:57:17] <NoOova> i could save selector in variable and every time do $(selector, parent) but it is slow
[22:57:21] <Cork> var p = $('parent'); p.find('new elements')
[22:57:35] <Cork> ya, cause you have to do a new selection
[22:57:49] <Cork> and when new elements are added to the dom, that is what you have to do
[22:58:07] <Cork> events can be added with delegation, but not dom manipulation
[22:58:32] <NoOova> i want for jQuery watches for dom change and automatcally update elements in found Jquery objext
[22:58:53] <Cork> it has to do a query to the browser to do that
[22:59:00] <raj> coldhead, can I force a file to be downloaded instead of opened by the  browser?
[22:59:02] <Cork> its the same thing as using .find or $() your self
[22:59:16] <coldhead> yes raj, if you can set the HTTP headers
[22:59:24] <tw2113> it's more a server setting than js thing
[22:59:28] <tw2113> raj,
[22:59:28] <raj> coldhead, how's that?
[22:59:30] <raj> oh
[22:59:40] <NoOova> like var $elements = $('.someclass'); console.log($elements.size()) // =1;  {some dom updates}; console.log($elements.size()) // =2;
[22:59:42] <Cork> NoOova: native hs gives you a result set from a query, that set it a match in time, there is no way to make it dynamic
[22:59:43] <NoOova> like that
[22:59:47] <raj> so what's the flow to make that happen?
[23:00:00] <raj> click a button, some msg is sent to server to do what?
[23:00:03] <Cork> NoOova: you will have to do a new selection
[23:00:07] <coldhead> set the type for text files  to application/octet-stream in your server config
[23:00:08] <raj> set http headers and
[23:00:27] <raj> for binary data
[23:00:33] <raj> ?
[23:00:42] <tw2113> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/htaccess/force-files-to-download-not-open-in-browser/
[23:00:58] <Cork> NoOova: $() or variable.find() does document or parent.querySelectorAll()
[23:01:22] <Cork> NoOova: it can't do a state update that js natively doesn't support
[23:01:24] <raj> tw2113, it's not always the case
[23:01:34] <raj> so I don't wanna permantently affect those mime types
[23:02:55] <raj> do I just change the content-type in the response?
[23:04:06] <NoOova> thanx
