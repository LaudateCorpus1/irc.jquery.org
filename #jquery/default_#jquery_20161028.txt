[01:25:03] <SlizardWizard> I have been trying to fix this for like 20 minutes now, It works like expected when that line is commented out
[01:25:06] <SlizardWizard> https://gist.github.com/SlizardWizard/6d267e0c9676aae4b38f59d327060652
[01:25:31] <duch_kazatel> so what about it is broken?
[01:25:39] <duch_kazatel> like, what are you expecing to happen that isn't?
[01:25:53] <SlizardWizard> The error is in the gist
[01:26:20] <duch_kazatel> but if you uncomment that line it works fine?
[01:26:24] <SlizardWizard> yes
[01:26:33] <SlizardWizard> sorry other way arroynd
[01:26:38] <SlizardWizard> It works fine when it is commented
[01:27:02] <SlizardWizard> I get the uncaught type error when the line is uncommented
[01:27:45] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery?
[01:28:10] <duch_kazatel> because that shouldn't happen - i'd try each of those 4 methods separately to see which one is the issue.
[01:28:28] <SlizardWizard> ok
[01:33:21] <SlizardWizard> duch_kazatel: hmm, It is the trigger, which i think means the error is something else that is caused by trigger event
[01:33:29] <SlizardWizard> which makes sense, i just didn't think about it
[01:37:04] <duch_kazatel> :)
[03:09:49] <henk_> hey
[03:40:13] <Koopz> $.get(url, () => {}); should work, right?
[03:40:32] <Koopz> eh that's dumb...
[03:40:46] <Koopz> never mind i didn't say anything
[03:44:07] <henk_> gg
[03:44:29] <henk_> anyone know what's wrong here?
[03:44:30] <henk_> pastebin.com/jDTA6amH
[03:44:38] <henk_> http://i.imgur.com/3rgj2xa.png
[03:45:16] <henk_> what i am trying is, whenever someone clicks the anchor with that data id, it should show the div container with the same data id
[03:45:35] <henk_> i've been using it before but right now it won't work - i do not get errors and i cannot fetch it in console
[03:46:45] <Koopz> is that angular?
[03:48:37] <Koopz> first thing i'd try would be switchting to $('.toggle-details').on('click', function() {});
[03:49:25] <henk_> {{todo.todoid}} is twig
[03:49:35] <Koopz> ah okay
[03:49:52] <Koopz> so asynchronous modification of the page isn't the problem
[03:51:18] <Koopz> .toggle-details?
[03:51:30] <Koopz> shouldn't it be show-details?
[03:51:40] <henk_> no the id is set on load, and is also in the dom - so that should be alright
[03:51:57] <henk_> i have it on show details ^^ the paste is not uptodate sorry
[03:53:22] <Koopz> have you tried using .data() instead of .attr()?
[03:53:34] <Koopz> .data('toggle-id')
[03:53:35] <henk_> not yet
[03:53:42] <Koopz> todo-id*
[03:54:36] <henk_> did not work either
[03:57:21] <henk_> i also tried alert(targeId) but there is no error when clicking the element
[03:57:33] <Koopz> the screenshot says your anchor only has the clearfix-class. is that also not up to date?
[03:59:15] <henk_> oh where does that come from
[04:00:46] <henk_> ohh i had 2 class="" attr in the anchor
[04:00:50] <henk_> maybe that's the issue
[04:00:59] <Koopz> probably :P
[04:01:12] <henk_> well at least i got the alert now
[04:04:03] <henk_> thanks
[04:04:06] <henk_> that's embarrassing
[04:04:10] <Koopz> yw ;)
[05:50:42] <ravenzz> does jquery come with a way to grab the url parameters from a url to use in an ajax request?
[06:06:01] <Tennis> i'm sure ravenzz but off the top of my head i only know how to do it with php
[06:07:09] <Tennis> ah it doesn't look like it has a native way but a couple of people have written examples on stackoverflow
[06:37:47] <mar77i> hmm. is there a way to discover whether elements in a list are hidden in containers that have overflow:hidden?
[06:38:26] <MassDebates> Yes
[06:38:30] <AdamPDotty> hehe
[06:38:36] <MassDebates> There's many ways.
[06:39:09] <mar77i> it probably won't show up in :hidden, I guess?
[06:48:01] <mar77i> apparently elm[0].scrollWidth > elm.innerWidth() doesn't appear to do that either.
[06:48:26] <mar77i> MassDebates: where should I look?
[06:52:25] <MassDebates> sorry, I didn't see your msg
[06:52:49] <MassDebates> you should look at why you need to do this. From my experience, I've only been able to do overflow detection on my own in 1 of 2 ways
[06:53:03] <MassDebates> Other than that, I'd have to have installed a plugin that someone else made.
[06:53:28] <MassDebates> The first way is to compare box models in dimension and position/arrangement
[06:53:53] <sadtaco> Does jquery ui 1.11.4 not work with jquery 3?
[06:54:00] <MassDebates> no idea.
[07:00:27] <sadtaco> Weird... well with jquery ui autocomplete with 1.11.4 and jquery 3 it seems to not supply an element properly for the autocomplete dropdown
[07:00:36] <sadtaco> "jQuery.fn.offset() requires a valid DOM element"
[07:01:34] <MassDebates> Oh
[07:01:36] <MassDebates> Um
[07:01:39] <MassDebates> What order are you doing them in
[07:01:49] <MassDebates> Oh, wait, that wouldn't matter. Nevermind, sorry.
[07:14:56] <sadtaco> arg okay well.. with jquery migrate, jquery ui 1.11 is throwing depcreation warnings. My code is all fine.
[07:30:27] <sadtaco> so in ui 1.12 I now get "$.ui" is undefined on "$.extend($.ui.autocomplete.prototype.options, { ..."
[07:31:06] <sadtaco> Can't find the ref for jquery ui to do that stuff
[07:32:03] <sadtaco> https://api.jqueryui.com/1.12/jQuery.widget/ but this example references it...
[07:35:54] <sadtaco> oh oops
[08:09:37] <jak2000> HOW TO TEST IF A INPUT HAVE A VALID number
[08:09:42] <jak2000> sorry for caps
[08:09:56] <sadtaco> parseInt()
[08:10:12] <sadtaco> if "parseInt(num) == num" tends to suffice
[08:13:44] <jak2000> MMMM
[08:14:01] <jak2000> var myvalue=$('#value1').val();
[08:14:18] <jak2000> if (parseInt(myvalue)==myvalue)    <---- ?

[08:35:10] <sadtaco> string.charAt(0)
[08:35:30] <sadtaco> If you googled that exact wording you probably would have found the answer
[08:35:45] <sadtaco> Same answer for both of you there
[09:28:28] <jquery382> Hi guys, what is the best way to remove recursively child of a parant with jquery? For example here: http://dpaste.com/1QH9QK2 I have the container:"services-carousel-wrapper" I want to remove the firts child:"carousel-example-generic" then the child of the last one removed:"carousel-inner" and so on..
[09:29:31] <jquery382> I want preserve the content and remove only the container
[09:31:44] <jquery382> make sense?
[09:48:19] <henk_> .child().remove()?
[09:49:45] <pqnst> hey guys, can someone help me ? i am trying to change language on my site (www.savvy.rs) , but when i click on language button, it checks which div is active and then change language, but don't go to home-page, like it does now
[09:50:19] <pqnst> i am using window.location.hash and i can see which div is active, but i didn't manage to connect window.location.hash with + ?lang=en
[09:50:23] <AdamPDotty> container.replaceWith(container.html());
[09:51:52] <pqnst> AdamPDotty: hey, thanks for answer, but i still don't know what to do with it, so if you could be a bit more specific that would be helpful.
[09:52:07] <pqnst> It is all single page , with all div except home-page hidden on start
[09:52:53] <pqnst> so you are saying that i should remove a href="?lang=en"
[09:53:09] <pqnst> and add onClick event that is connecting window.location.hash and ?lang=en, but how to do it ?
[09:53:17] <pqnst> i've googled around but still unable to fix it
[09:53:51] <pqnst> it is changing the language, but it's also reloading to home-page, which i don't want,i want to stay on the specific page which should be translated
[10:10:56] <AdamPDotty> Ok, you should have started there. In the event handler you write event.preventDefault();
[10:11:04] <AdamPDotty> Then it will not change site.
[10:11:18] <AdamPDotty> then you replace or whatever
[10:37:21] <jpleau> Hi, using a selectmenu with jqueryui, is there a way to transfer classes from the <option> elements to the generated <li>s?
[10:40:30] <jpleau> hm, maybe I can try using _renderItem
[12:09:16] <xef> Hi, so I need to send an AJAX request to the localhost on my computer. I can send the request fine via $.get or an XMLHttpRequest, but jquery immediately goes to the fail function after sending the request, but I know the request is successful
[12:10:41] <xef> "the localhost on my computer" I guess that's redundant. I have a Django app that provides the end user with a data package that needs to be sent to some software on their computer and then do something once that completes.
[12:14:39] <mad_hatter> I have a div that is populated using an ajax call to a db, is there a way I can check to see if that div has been populated with that data?
[12:17:26] <xef> When would you want to check if it's been populated? You could set a data- value on the ajax success function and check if that's been changed, or a class. Check if the class is in the div.classList or not
[12:17:48] <MikeD_> wouldn't the div have content if it's been populated?
[12:18:41] <mad_hatter> well its not done with the ajax success function
[12:18:48] <mad_hatter> its done with .getJSON
[12:19:29] <mad_hatter> i just need to know when that POST is finished so i can .hide() another element
[12:20:38] <mad_hatter> here's the piece of jquery: var oTable = $('#queryTable').dataTable(dts_opts);
[12:21:20] <mad_hatter> so whenever datatables finishes doing its post to the back end, i want to unhide content, and then hide another div
[12:23:30] <xef> I don't know about these dataTables, but looking at this page it looks like you can just add a success callback, can't you do it there? https://datatables.net/reference/option/ajax
[12:24:38] <mad_hatter> yeah. but im using an older version of datatables
[12:25:09] <xef> ): refactor it into a $.ajax request. that's my best idea
[12:25:22] <mad_hatter> yeah that's what i was trying to avoid
[12:25:29] <xef> I understand
[12:25:31] <mad_hatter> i was hoping there was some sort of jquery workaround
[12:25:40] <mad_hatter> like binding it to a .load event

[14:40:49] <mooru> hello people, is there a plugin that allows one to open a lightbox inside say a div tag and not appended to the body tag
[15:18:42] <z1haze_work> any folks here used the youtube iframe api? I am havign trouble, console errors reporting net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT errors when i try to load the player
[15:19:21] <Robdgreat> z1haze_work: do you use adblock or similar, by chance?
[15:19:49] <z1haze_work> ah yep
[15:19:51] <z1haze_work> good call
[15:20:21] <z1haze_work> bummer, that wasnt the cause though
[15:21:25] <z1haze_work> http://bit.ly/2f07Rt9 clicking on the banner image loads a youtube video into the container, the action seems to happen, but no video
[15:21:57] <z1haze_work> here's my script http://dpaste.com/2GD12SH i load youtube.init() on doc ready so the events are binded
[15:22:11] <z1haze_work> if you have any thoughts, that would be awesome
[15:22:55] <taplar> aww, morru left.  i was going to say he might could do some sort of css approach https://jsfiddle.net/1pv1roxc/1/
[15:26:09] <z1haze_work> ah nevermind
[15:26:12] <z1haze_work> was just my css was borked
[15:26:14] <z1haze_work> thanks anyways
[16:26:43] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[16:34:50] * taplar is being invaded by kiddies
[16:36:10] <robhol> all CSS is borked.
[16:36:18] <robhol> it's its natural state.

[17:42:33] <mwalther> Hello! I'm building an abstraction class in js for modals. I had a question about jQuery style attributes that can be seen at the end of the SO answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3015581/1754679 My question is, is the parameter "content" in this example an HTML string that would be placed inside the selected parent, or is it an object of some variety?
[17:43:24] <taplar> looks like it would be the stuff inbetween the <></>
[17:43:41] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you use it - are you using the object syntax?
[17:43:49] <taplar> if i had to guess.  i'm not aware of a 'html' dom property
[17:44:15] <robertmaxrees> iirc you can use either an DOM node, jquery object, or string there.
[17:44:20] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to find out.
[17:44:45] <mwalther> The docs didn't seem to answer it clearly. They talked about the other attrs.
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> could always test in a fiddle :)(
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> * :)
[17:46:07] <robertmaxrees> and actually, the docs do :D
[17:46:23] <mwalther> Would you kindly provide a link?
[17:46:26] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes -> When passing HTML to jQuery(), note that text nodes are not treated as DOM elements. With the exception of a few methods (such as .content()), they are generally ignored or removed. E.g:
[17:46:51] <robertmaxrees> implies it can take a DOM node for that arg.  super easy to test though.
[17:49:25] <robertmaxrees> ah, maybe not.  hrmmm.
[17:50:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/nm03rhpa/ aaand there we go: DOM node, string, jquery object..
[17:52:02] <taplar> i used to make elements like that, but i think not a small portion of people find it slightly confusing
[17:52:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[17:52:15] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a terrible templating engine.
[17:52:30] <VeryBewitching> You don't say
[17:52:38] <taplar> no, he just did
[17:52:42] <taplar> *points*
[17:52:50] <VeryBewitching> hah
[17:52:58] <taplar> seriously.  *points* :D:D:D
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> U AIN'T THE BOSS OF ME.
[17:53:13] <taplar> i'm just gonna be the oblivious guy in the room
[17:53:16] <taplar> so same as always
[17:54:27] <VeryBewitching> mwalther: Consider using a text template.
[17:55:32] <mwalther> @robertmaxrees @VeryBewitching Thank you for your help.
[18:09:13] <mwalther> I see how that works! That is a very clever attributing feature. Now my code will be slightly cleaner :)
[18:19:03] <robertmaxrees> mwalther most people would say that's less clean than other solutions.
[18:23:19] * taplar plays some gwen stefani 'dont speak'
[18:23:55] <taplar> really think that's the unofficial anthem for the room some times, :)
[18:27:41] <taplar> though now i have an odd desire to take a bunch of cut scenes from clinton reacting to trump and put it to that song
[18:42:39] <taplar> mmm, vscode hates missing js parameters
[19:01:26] <taplar> i didn't realize you don't name arrow functions...
[19:26:53] <ConcernedHobbit> Heya, is this the right channel for asking questions about jQuery plugins? I don't see any neater way to get IRC support
[19:28:40] <taplar> ask away.  if anyone can help, they'll speak up
[19:30:19] <ConcernedHobbit> this is frustrating... you know the thing where you have a thing working, you change something that should under no circumstance affect it, it breaks, you remove the thing that "broke" it and it's still broken?
[19:30:52] <ConcernedHobbit> (and yet it still works, just throws a meaningless error?)
[19:30:57] <ConcernedHobbit> (except sometimes when it actually breaks)
[19:31:06] <taplar> heh
[19:31:50] <ConcernedHobbit> Using DataTables (datatables.net), I have a data structure which has objects. They have the object "blobs", which has "release" and "solve" under them. The plugin *can* understand when I want to get blobs.release, but when I try to get blobs it throws an error
[19:32:38] <ConcernedHobbit> http://pastebin.com/A1ziPXif Here's an example of the code
[19:33:11] <ConcernedHobbit> (and right after //tts, there's another that requests blobs.solve that goes through just fine)
[19:34:09] <ConcernedHobbit> it worked before, when i added the other if for sort it broke and when i commented it out it stayed broken
[19:34:27] <ConcernedHobbit> ... oh what the fuck.
[19:34:42] <ConcernedHobbit> Removing the "if (type === 'display') {" worked
[19:37:52] <ConcernedHobbit> Problem solved... That's really weird.
[19:39:29] <mwalther> I don't remember "dispaly" being one of the 6 flavors I love and enjoy.
[19:41:57] <taplar> hmm?
[22:36:38] <jak2000> hi all
