[18:29:57] <\Kalascus> What's the correct way to sort elements based on if they have a specific class or not?
[18:34:45] <\Kalascus> table.children().sort((a, b) => $(a).hasClass("inactive") - $(b).hasClass("inactive")).appendTo(table)
[18:34:47] <\Kalascus> Just this?
[19:04:09] <pavonia^\_^\> Subtracting Boolean values seems wrong to me, but if it works in JS ...
[20:33:52] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, have an array of objects that represent the data in the table and operate against that instead.  render outthe array however you'd like after sorting the data.
