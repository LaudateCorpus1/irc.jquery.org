[00:28:27] <S1GM4> I hate to have to say this, but if random users right now are messaging you images, DO NOT CLICK THEM. For the love of God, trust me on this. There is some kind of attack going on.
[01:44:08] <raul782> Hey guys, Is there a reason why $('div.my-fields').empty() wouldn't work the first time, though the 2nd and later attempts do work?
[01:45:11] <pavonia> Perhaps the element doesn't yet exist when it's called the first time
[01:46:32] <S1GM4> pavonia: I'd guess that too
[01:46:42] <S1GM4> Story of my life... either it already exists or doesn't exist yet, whichever I don't need.
[01:47:35] <raul782> pavonia: thanks for the adive, though it looks like it exists, because I'm doing a console.log($fields), where $fields = $('div.my-fields')
[01:47:45] <raul782> *advice
[01:47:59] <S1GM4> He's not saying it doesn't exist period
[01:48:02] <S1GM4> (or she)
[01:48:08] <S1GM4> just that it does not exist when you are trying to access it.
[01:48:21] <S1GM4> try to put another message to the console before and after you attempt to access it
[01:48:28] <raul782> ok
[01:51:13] <raul782> humm, S1GM4, it looked like it exists before and after, but there must be something in between that it's not letting me empty that div :/
[01:54:28] <rambhairao> .each()
[01:55:41] <rambhairao> $(all).ready(function(){this.exit;});
[02:05:14] <Cork> raul782: what does console.log($('div.my-fields').length) give you (just before .empty())
[02:05:33] <Cork> rambhairao: is that meant to be a question?
[02:12:53] <raul782> Cark: Actually, I believe I found the issue, the empty works, but there is an ajax call on the change event of the 2nd of 2 selects which is putting back the contents
[02:13:26] <raul782> so I need to make sure that ajax, is triggered after checking the latest value of the second select
[02:18:15] <Cork> raul782: heh, that was my second suggestion (synchronicity) ok, good you solved it
[03:01:09] <AllTuna> Howdy
[03:02:09] <AllTuna> If I have a signup.js script with methods relating to my signup modal, its validation, etc, how would a file like that look like conventionally?
[03:02:37] <AllTuna> At the moment I just have an object with properties such as "open" set to methods
[03:04:23] <rbo> Yo
[03:04:28] <rbo> sup tuna
[03:11:27] <AllTuna> Heya, rbo
[03:23:08] <Cork> AllTuna: not sure what you mean by that, javascript doesn't have files so if you separate things in different files doesn't affect anything
[03:23:55] <Cork> AllTuna: if you want it to be related to a specific interface section bind it to it with a selector + event handle
[08:31:57] <nardev> helo guys, i have an issue.. i have form with multiple inputs as array by names .. how can i get JSON encoded and properly ordered values from there, here is example: https://paste.debian.net/981776/
[08:32:14] <nardev> can be pure JS
[08:34:55] <Cork> nardev: simple answer; you can't
[08:35:31] <Cork> you can grab the set of inputs and push the results into crafted arrays to build a list
[08:36:06] <Cork> nardev: also by pure js you mean without the use of jquery? (in that case you should ask in ##javascript)
[08:55:47] <nardev> Cork, thank you
[08:56:06] <nardev> so it's only possible to do it manually??
[08:56:54] <nardev> Cork, i thought of making "universal" submit function which i can use for any form in the app... since in backend i can easly handle json
[08:57:05] <nardev> So, it's not so easy...
[08:57:29] <Cork> nardev: you could grab the input field and build an array of the set of name and value
[08:57:50] <Cork> but you would have a list of duplicated names as it isn't arrays, just names with [] at the end of the name string
[08:58:21] <nardev> Cork, what about https://paste.debian.net/981783/
[08:58:23] <Cork> and those two characters is parsed by scripts like php to take the names and build an array of the duplicate names
[08:58:41] <nardev> the issue there is that it packs all fields "message" into a message node
[08:58:44] <Cork> that isn't pure js
[08:58:54] <Cork> if you hadn't asked for it i would have recommended it
[08:58:55] <nardev> doesn't group as i need it to be grouped
[08:59:22] <Cork> it groups
[08:59:26] <nardev> Cork, i have C++ on another side :)
[08:59:33] <nardev> not as flexible as php
[08:59:53] <nardev> and <1M of memory in total
[09:00:05] <Cork> nardev: well ya, cause most ppl don't like implementing that complex mess
[09:00:19] <Cork> and serializeObject is normally close enough
[09:00:44] <nardev> serializeObject.. i'll look at it..
[09:01:18] <nardev> my pity is that i want to make ti as generic as possible.. so that i can handle 10 slightly different forms with same code...
[09:01:40] <Cork> the code snippet you pasted is that plugin...
[09:02:03] <Cork> nardev: you should be able to
[09:02:06] <nardev> Cork, i have seen somebody having the plugin same as that one.. but  no.. it's just a function working as it is
[09:02:11] <nardev> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17488660/difference-between-serialize-and-serializeobject-jquery
[09:02:15] <Cork> what exactly is it that serializeObject can't do for you?
[09:02:40] <Cork> nardev: ya,... you want me to link the github page with the plugin code?
[09:02:52] <Cork> the so page has just copy pasted the code instead of linking it
[09:03:25] <nardev> well :( i'll be honest, i just tested it... didn't look what it does ... 1. i need to stingify that after i grub all input fields .. and ajax/POST it to a hardware where i need to get it as JSON object
[09:03:49] <nardev> I have this onthe other side: https://bblanchon.github.io/ArduinoJson/
[09:03:50] <Cork> ok so just use JSON.stringify()
[09:04:03] <Cork> serializeObject gives you an object, not json
[09:04:25] <nardev> what about object to string?
[09:04:32] <nardev> because i need it in proper format
[09:04:41] <Cork> see my second to last comment
[09:04:45] <nardev> so that i can automatically use it in C++ as JSON
[09:04:51] <nardev> ok i'll
[09:04:57] <nardev> thnx
[09:05:21] <nardev> i see that i lost some things.. bit confused after going in circle for a while
[09:05:28] <nardev> concentration down
[09:06:18] <nardev> Cork, so something like this you propose? JSON.stringify($('form#'+formId).serializeObject())
[09:06:19] <nardev> ?
[09:06:34] <Cork> yes
[09:06:51] <Cork> as long as you have the plugin loaded that is
[09:08:04] <nardev> Cork, here is what i get
[09:08:05] <nardev> https://pastebin.com/Zj73BeQs
[09:08:28] <Cork> ah, that looks about right
[09:08:40] <Cork> and?
[09:10:29] <nardev> ... have those [] in name
[09:11:20] <nardev> and instead of having a blocks like {root, type, code...}  i get blocks {root, root, root...} {type, type, type}
[09:29:28] <jak2000> hi all, wich float window recommend me?
[09:29:45] <jak2000> user can move...
[09:29:50] <jak2000> or close
[09:31:26] <mchlsndrn> hello everyone. i've upgraded from jquery 1.11 to 3.2.1 and i've just noticed that window.load fires before document.ready. shouldn't it be the opposite?
[10:17:53] <poboy> Is anyone able to help?  I just need a function where I can replace the contents of #currentDebtor with #incomingDebtor  https://paste.laravel.io/VpGZa
[10:18:10] <poboy> I figure I could do .replaceWith() but I can't seem to figure it out
[10:28:55] <AdamPDotty> sumtin like $('#currentDebtor').html($('#incomingDebtor').html());
[10:32:34] <AdamPDotty> and instead of the if-storm you could go with $('#incomingDebtors').children('debtorSelected').each(function(){...});
[10:33:15] <AdamPDotty> You should use variables and avoid .css().
[10:41:56] <Cork> using children() has the problem in that it doesn't work if you have text directly inside incomingDedtor
[10:43:05] <Cork> so if it is safe depends on what dom structure you're working with
[10:45:50] <AdamPDotty> but the textnode are just additional children I thought
[10:45:52] <AdamPDotty> s
[10:54:19] <Cork> AdamPDotty: no it isn't
[10:54:37] <Cork> its not elements its textnodes and those aren't included in children
[10:54:54] <poboy> AdamPDotty: thanks
[11:41:51] <nardev> Cork, if i have array of someName[] fields, how do i get just "someName"
[11:43:28] <nardev> ex. http://jsfiddle.net/yuq17nd1/ i just want to get "pages_title"
[11:43:37] <nardev> nit pages_title[]
[13:08:16] <Pankaj_> How to filter unique value from array
[13:11:25] <taplar> you want to remove values that do not repeat from the array?
[13:28:17] <taplar> good talk
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> hah
[14:11:22] <nardev> if i have array of someName[] fields, how do i get just "someName"
[14:12:34] <taplar> example array?
[14:19:23] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[14:28:12] <poboy> guys I still can't figure this out. I want a function overwriteCurrent to overwrite #currentDebtor with #incomingDebtor.   https://paste.laravel.io/NRZaW
[14:28:31] <robertmaxrees> "overwrite"?
[14:28:31] <poboy> I know this aint fiverr.com but I'l paypal $10usd if someone help me solve this today.  :D
[14:28:37] <robertmaxrees> no moniez.
[14:28:41] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you for free ;)
[14:28:51] <robertmaxrees> got a fiddle?
[14:29:38] <poboy> that function i listed will copy info from a column and place it in another.  what i want now it to replace the contents of column 2 with column 1
[14:29:45] <poboy> i'll work on  a fiddle
[14:30:30] <aguz> you should refactor your code
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> lol we'll get there ;)
[14:31:05] <aguz> you're repeating $('#currentDebtor') too many times, lol
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[14:31:16] <poboy> problem is I'm a mediocre php dev and i've been thrown into doing jquery which I don't know. :)
[14:31:16] <robertmaxrees> give it a minute ;)
[14:31:24] <robertmaxrees> we'll help you out.
[14:31:41] <aguz> like, try to make your code more readable...
[14:32:08] <robertmaxrees> aguz it's gonna be hard for him to do that when a) he admits he doesn't know much and b) he's lost on how to solve the problem itself.
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> we'll work on it tho :)
[14:32:32] <aguz> but maybe it will help to make it simple to read...
[14:32:53] <robertmaxrees> how do you refactor code that doesn't work and you're not sure what you need to do?
[14:32:53] <taplar> 'it'?
[14:34:34] <poboy> that function works.  i'm tryign to use it as a template to write a somewhat similar one.
[14:35:21] <taplar> can you show us an example of the markup that this logic is operating upon?
[14:35:45] <robertmaxrees> (i already asked for a fiddle but apparently i'm invisible D:)
[14:35:50] <taplar> preferably in a fiddle like robert asked for
[14:36:39] <taplar> the invisible ghost takes it's turn on us all, heh
[14:38:31] <aguz> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/CrlJHjcD/
[14:38:40] <robertmaxrees> that's the JS.
[14:38:46] <robertmaxrees> the markup would be suuuper helpful.
[14:38:50] <robertmaxrees> isolated test cases and all that.
[14:39:35] <aguz> haha, yeah, you like mocha or jasmine?
[14:39:48] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:40:52] <taplar> test case, not unit test
[14:40:58] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:41:14] <poboy> working on a fiddle
[14:47:24] <fdawsefd> Doing $("[id*='btnAdd']").trigger('click'); in the console works, but doing $(document).ready(function() { $("[id*='btnAdd']").trigger('click'); }) in the script tag seems to make the page reload before the OnClick code finishes
[14:48:02] <fdawsefd> anybody know why that is?
[14:48:10] <taplar> what on click code?
[14:48:34] <taplar> fiddle please
[14:48:37] <fdawsefd> the onclick for the button with element id btnAdd
[14:48:55] <fdawsefd> I will see if I can make a fiddle
[14:53:42] <fdawsefd> I can't recreate the behavior in a minimal case. The button does a postback, and when the button is clicked by a user, or clicked using JS in the console, the postback works properly and navigates to another page. When clicked using JS in a script tag, it just reloads the page
[14:54:46] <taplar> the user doing it or you in the console is after the page loads and any event handlers are attached to it
[14:55:05] <taplar> if you run the click before the click handlers are put on them, of course it will not invoke htem
[14:58:44] <fdawsefd> wrapping it in $(document).ready() or $(window).load() does not fix the issue
[15:00:28] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding moveIncoming
[15:02:38] <fdawsefd> what is moveIncoming?
[15:05:56] <poboy> geez, can't even get the current functionality to work but here's the fiddle so far  https://jsfiddle.net/vv0qvnkg/
[15:06:24] <poboy> next time I'll wait until I have a fiddle ready before asking a question. ;)
[15:09:08] <taplar> i'm just trying to get a grasp of the markup, cause I really feel like you are over using ids
[15:10:03] <taplar> javascript has the concept of contextual lookups, which when used in conjunction with markup structured properly with classes can make logic much simplier
[15:10:14] <poboy> i'm sure. this project is huge and ugly and I'm a month into the job trying to pull my weight
[15:11:17] <taplar> so help me get this in my head.  you got a group of incomingDebtors and currentDeptors, yes?
[15:13:29] <poboy> correct
[15:13:52] <taplar> within those you have some concept of a debtor, yes?
[15:14:16] <poboy> yes
[15:14:58] <taplar> conceptually, how does a debtor in the incoming differ from one in the current?
[15:15:25] <poboy> incoming is already set and can not be altered
[15:15:34] <poboy> current can be empty, the same or different
[15:15:53] <taplar> i'm not talking about what you can do with them
[15:15:53] <taplar> i'm talking about their structure
[15:16:13] <taplar> how are they different?
[15:16:23] <poboy> they are not different to my knowledge
[15:17:08] <taplar> alright, so the only difference that affects what you can do with them, is if they belong to the incomingDebtors or the currentDebtors, yes?
[15:17:58] <poboy> correct
[15:18:28] <taplar> alright, so then, what can you do to a debtor that is in the incomingDebtors, conceptually
[15:19:19] <poboy> just view them
[15:19:46] <taplar> and what about the debtors in the currentDebtors?
[15:20:47] <poboy> I can add, edit and delete
[15:22:42] <taplar> Alright, so if a debtor belongs to the currentDebtors element, it would also show an edit/delete options and some other place in currentDebtors would have an option to create a new one, yes?
[15:24:05] <poboy> yes
[15:24:56] <taplar> alright so lets talk about the delete first since that would be for existing values
[15:25:26] <taplar> we can conceptualize both the incomingDebtors and currentDebtors as boxes on your page, independent of each other
[15:25:41] <taplar> debtors would be smaller boxes inside those boxes
[15:26:11] <taplar> in each of those boxes you'd have all the related information for each debtor, name, address, etc
[15:26:16] <taplar> including the delete button, yes?
[15:26:57] <poboy> incoming debtors are displayed on the left of the page, current debtors on the right.  In the middle are 2 buttons.  you highlight which debtors you are dealing with and click one of the 2 buttons
[15:27:12] <poboy> 1 button copies the incoming debtor and populates a new current debtor foryou
[15:27:22] <SideFX> I have a bunch of class="whatever" and $('.page_btn').click(function() {
[15:27:25] <poboy> the other deletes the current debtor.  here is that function.  https://paste.laravel.io/r5OyB
[15:27:40] <SideFX> Whoops that paste auto hit enter on my irc program.
[15:27:41] <taplar> i'm still talking conceptually
[15:27:50] <taplar> so there isn't a delete button for each debtor?
[15:28:18] <SideFX> Is there a way to get $(this) to tell me which number of the element I'm on?
[15:28:20] <poboy> no. there is just one delete button and you must highlight 1 or more current debtors you wish to delete
[15:28:50] <taplar> alright, and i see you are using a class to mark which ones are 'selected'
[15:28:55] <taplar> ok, so a single delete button
[15:28:59] <poboy> correct
[15:29:49] <taplar> so if we have logic for each of our debtors inside the currentDebtor box, that if you click them we add/remove our selected class, we can keep state that way of which ones are selected to do something
[15:30:24] <taplar> then when we click delete all we have to do is $(selectTheCurrentDebtor).find('debtorElementClass') to find them all
[15:30:28] <taplar> with out the need for ids
[15:30:38] <taplar> err
[15:31:07] <taplar> then when we click delete all we have to do is $(selectTheCurrentDebtor).find('debtorElementClass.debtorSelected') to find them all
[15:31:12] <taplar> forgot the selected class
[15:35:24] <taplar> comprende?
[15:37:31] <poboy> yes
[15:39:54] <taplar> you can do similar lookups for editing and adding and such
[15:40:23] <taplar> all the data for a debtor is inside the debtor.  if you have the debtor you and find() off of it by a class without having to worry what the id is
[15:40:33] <taplar> or if it even needs an id
[15:42:52] <poboy> thanks taplar for the explanation.  I'm going to work on this tonight and hopefully I'll get it figured out
[15:43:42] <taplar> sure
[15:51:48] <taplar> SideFX: you mean the index of the page_btn you clicked?
[19:37:05] <Braden`> Hello!
[19:37:08] <Braden`> <input type="button" id="loginSubmit"value="Log In"/>       $("#loginSubmit").click(function() { alert("Hi!"); }    <--- It isn't doing anything.  Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?

[19:39:50] <Braden`> None
[19:40:11] <robertmaxrees> 'cauise that's not val;id code.
[19:40:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/ze9w4rpa/
[19:40:51] <robertmaxrees> is that button in a form perhaps?
[19:41:22] <Braden`> Yes
[19:41:44] <robertmaxrees> the issue perhaps that the page reloads?
[19:42:53] <robertmaxrees> '
[19:43:07] <robertmaxrees> *'cause if so, bind a listener to the form's submit and preventDefault on the event.
[19:44:18] <pavonia> I guess it's a timing problem, try registering all handlers in $(function () { ... })
[19:47:44] <Braden`> but its type button not submit
[19:47:58] <Braden`> The page doesn't reload
[19:50:53] <Braden`> https://jsfiddle.net/ze9w4rpa/1/
[19:52:24] <pavonia> In your example a parenthesis is missing, but in real code it may still fire before the element exists, depending where it's defined
[19:52:56] <Braden`> The js is defined at the top of the page
[19:53:06] <Braden`> the form is in the middle of the page
[19:54:16] <pavonia> That's likely the cause, it's executed before the DOM element exists
[19:55:13] <Braden`> So move my js files to the bottom of the html page?
[19:57:06] <Braden`> Yep, that fixed it
[19:57:11] <pavonia> Better put your handler registration code into something that is executed when thewhole document i loaded, like document.onload, $(document).ready() or simple $(function () { ... })
[20:49:02] <rapha> in a nested <ul><li><ul><li><a></li><li><a>...</ul> structure (where an <a> could be pretty much anywhere), is it possible for me to find the preceding <a> to any given <a>, no matter at what nesting level the initial element and the element-to-be-found are?
