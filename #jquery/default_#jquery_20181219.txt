[04:12:55] <EugenA> what event do I need to check to detect setting new value with input.val('test') ?
[04:13:31] <EugenA> change doesn't seem to work
[04:15:29] <Cork> there isn't one
[04:15:43] <Cork> events are to know abot user actions not scripts
[04:28:47] <Woodpecker> whats a good way to test jquery, like `alert('foo');` is good for testing javascript?
[04:29:32] <Cork> you should never use alert
[04:29:34] <Cork> ever
[04:29:46] <Cork> use console.log if you want to log info
[04:29:47] <Woodpecker> Cork: for debugging?
[04:29:52] <Cork> debug what
[04:29:54] <Woodpecker> Cork: that isnt working for me.
[04:30:01] <Cork> what browser?
[04:30:15] <Woodpecker> QWebEnginePage::runJavascript();
[04:30:28] <Cork> well that isn't a browser so you don't have the normal tools
[04:30:41] <Woodpecker> http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebenginepage.html#runJavaScript-3
[04:30:45] <Cork> donno what you have available there, would have to ask in qwebs support
[04:31:12] <Woodpecker> Unfortunately I couldnt get console.log to work. It was really puzzling
[04:31:32] <Cork> ya, cause you're not using a browser
[04:31:38] <Cork> so you won't have the console
[04:31:39] <Woodpecker> alert works though, lol and I dont care about your warning. I just need to know if my jquery injection is workign or not.
[04:31:48] <Cork> again cause you aren't using a browser
[04:31:58] <Cork> so ask qwebs support what you can use
[04:32:54] <Woodpecker> Cork: Yeah I have not quite figured out how to properly pipe yet. But in any case, is there like a highlight command or something to jquery? Also its not quite true that I do not have a browser.
[04:33:22] <Cork> again, you have to go to a channel where your question is topic
[04:33:31] <Cork> you won't find much help here
[04:34:23] <Woodpecker> Cork: yes I will. My question is simple. What is a good command to test jquery with, just like `alert('foobar');` << that pops up when I run it.
[04:34:31] <Cork> ...
[04:34:44] <Cork> start listening, i can't answer you as you're question isn't ontopic here
[04:34:55] <Cork> you will have to ask in a place that knows about qweb
[04:34:58] <Woodpecker> It is on topic. This is jquery.
[04:35:05] <Cork> but your question isn't about jquery
[04:35:08] <Woodpecker> I am running jquery code.
[04:35:10] <Woodpecker> yes it is.
[04:35:12] <Cork> it is about qweb
[04:35:22] <Cork> lbut jquery is just a hepler lib, it doesn't run the code
[04:35:32] <Cork> so the question depends on qweb
[04:35:39] <Woodpecker> Its not a single variable question, duh, but it depends on jquery
[04:35:46] <Woodpecker> im literally injecting jquery code.
[04:35:58] <Woodpecker> `console.log` is just plain javascript.
[04:36:13] <Cork> ya, you're litteraly trying to debug javascrip executed in webkit in qweb
[04:36:19] <Woodpecker> you could run that and still not ascertain whether you have injected jquery properly.
[04:36:37] <Cork> it has zero to do with jquery except it is a dependency you have
[04:36:45] <Woodpecker> Cork: that is one facet. I need a good jquery command.
[04:36:59] <Cork> there isn't one as jquery isn't a language
[04:37:22] <Woodpecker> omg you are brain damaged. To say it has nothing to do with jquery, when I am clearly asking for jquery command.
[04:37:39] <Cork> ...
[04:37:43] <Woodpecker> and no one is arguing it isnt a framework, but it certainly does expand a syntax as a framework.
[04:38:05] <Cork> jquery is a set of script that let you easier work with dom
[04:38:15] <Cork> it isn't an enterpreter or a debugger
[04:38:15] <Woodpecker> Cork: Yes, a framework.
[04:38:20] <Cork> so what you ask for doesn't exist...
[04:38:24] <Woodpecker> Just like Qt isnt its own language.
[04:38:43] <Cork> but they are the one enterpriting what you write
[04:38:47] <Woodpecker> no, you are making distinctions without any differences.
[04:38:52] <Cork> ...
[04:39:04] <Cork> have fun arguing withsomeone else
[04:39:07] <Woodpecker> Cork: But my problem isnt with QWebengine. I know it works properly.
[04:39:24] <Woodpecker> Cork: ah, passive aggressiveness. Okay.
[04:45:28] <Woodpecker> Cork: `alert(jQuery.fn.jquer)` << This worked. See, told you were wrong.
[04:45:57] <Woodpecker> `alert(jQuery.fn.jquery)`*
[06:16:41] <AlbertoP> Hello. I am using jquery validation in an asp.net core app. One of my pages has a partial view with input boxes added "onchange" of a dropdown. The problem I am facing is that when the partial is updated, validation data- tags are added, but the validation messages are not shown until I post the form (read: if I insert incorrect input and leave the input box, nothing is shown)
[06:18:22] <AlbertoP> I have searched for solutions, and found that I should re-parse the form, which I am trying to do, but without much success. Do you have a link or some reference showing an example?
[07:13:09] <Ricazlol> Hello. Is it not possible to retrieve the HTTP response body from $.post().fail()?
[07:14:12] <Ricazlol> For successful requests, I just do: $.post('...').done(function(response) { alert(response.message) });
[07:14:26] <Ricazlol> Is the payload not available on failure? (HTTP 406 in this case)
[07:17:57] <AlbertoP> hmm dynamic partial views and "unobtrusive" validation seem really not that well explained anywhere :\
[07:30:00] <Woet> I haven't done serious templating on the frontend before, but usually I end up with something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/cz8p5xdu/
[07:30:21] <Woet> now I have to make something more advanced that has to scale, so is there anything more efficient out there?
[07:30:35] <Woet> not sure if using a templating framework will actually improve performance
[07:35:47] <AlbertoP> so I am loading a partial view via "load", and I need to validate the input controls in the partial... what is the appropriate way to do this?
[07:38:49] <AlbertoP> or, alternative question, how do I access the html loaded by .load(...)?
[07:45:46] <Woet> turns out its about a bajillion times faster with mustache.js
[07:45:50] <Woet> mainly because of the .find and sizzle
[10:29:26] <Es0teric> if i have an <a href="#page1">Page 1</a> and I want to detect a click on that... how would I do that?
[10:30:10] <shoky> .on('click', ..    ?
[10:30:20] <Es0teric> shoky what else?
[10:30:34] <shoky> to detect a click on that, you don't need anything else..
[10:30:49] <Es0teric> i want to detect a click on the hash
[10:31:02] <shoky> clicks are on elements, not hashes
[10:31:23] <Es0teric> ok
[10:31:31] <Es0teric> I still want to detect a click on the #page1
[10:31:49] <shoky> select the <a> element, and do .on('click'  on it
[10:32:12] <Es0teric> oh isnt it something like.. $()
[10:32:21] <shoky> that's how you select elements, yes
[10:32:47] <shoky> if you have a question about selecting elements, that's another question, which you have not asked :p
[10:32:48] <Es0teric> $('a').on('click', function(e) { $(this).attr('href') == '#page1' })
[10:32:48] <Es0teric> ?
[10:33:29] <shoky> if you need to target this specific element, you can put an id on it and select with $('#the_id')
[10:33:52] <shoky> another less nice option:  $('a[href="#page1"]')
[10:33:53] <Es0teric> i know that
[10:34:08] <Es0teric> but if i am asking to target the href i obviously do not have control of that
[10:34:27] <shoky> nothing is obvious when i have no info and you have all of it
[10:34:37] <shoky> it's only as obvious as you make it :p
[10:35:49] * AlbertoP is quite confused about element selection after playing with another issue ^^
[10:36:44] <AlbertoP> isn't $('#xy') equivalent to document.getElementById('xy')?
[10:36:53] <Cork> it is
[10:37:01] <shoky> AlbertoP: equivalent yes, identical no
[10:37:05] <AlbertoP> ok then I am even more confused
[10:37:29] <AlbertoP> so I have a code working find if I do the first, but I am trying to generalize it
[10:37:29] <shoky> one returns a jquery object, one returns a raw DOM element
[10:37:53] <AlbertoP> so I wrote a function, which takes as argument the id...
[10:37:58] <Cork> AlbertoP: what exactly are you trying to do, and what exactly is the error?
[10:38:11] <AlbertoP> I think your previous statement answered
[10:38:26] <AlbertoP> raw DOM... doesn't have .val() method
[10:38:31] <Cork> nope
[10:38:34] <Cork> you need to wrap it
[10:38:55] <AlbertoP> hmm wrap?
[10:39:38] <shoky> put $(  )  around a raw DOM element to wrap it in a jquery object, which you can call e.g. .val() on
[10:40:05] <AlbertoP> I see
[10:40:14] <shoky> e.g.  $( document.getElementById('xy') ).val()
[10:40:19] <AlbertoP> yeah
[10:40:55] <AlbertoP> this stuff is ehm... quite convoluted :-)
[10:41:12] <AlbertoP> at least to a new learner
[10:42:44] <AlbertoP> but at least I fixed the problem I had this morning with partial views and client-side validation :)
[10:43:31] <shoky> btw to get a rawDOM element's value, you could also just use .value on it
[10:43:52] <shoky> which is what jquery does with .val() in the common cases
[10:44:13] <AlbertoP> ok
[10:44:31] <AlbertoP> so getElementById(...).value()?
[10:44:46] <shoky> without the last () , it's not a function
[10:45:00] <AlbertoP> oh right
[10:45:01] <AlbertoP> thanks
[10:46:21] <AlbertoP> speaking of functions, I had another question which came when using .load()
[10:48:09] <AlbertoP> does the callback function in the load call need to be defined inside the load call, or can I use an externally defined function?
[10:49:33] <AlbertoP> meaning: .load(..., function() {...}) vs. .load(..., myFunc())
[10:50:14] <shoky> AlbertoP: you can always name an "externally defined" function instead of putting an inline function.  but it's:   .load(..., myFunc)    without the ()
[10:50:29] <shoky> otherwise you'd be executing myFunc immediately
[10:50:42] <shoky> and passing its return value to .load()
[10:50:51] <AlbertoP> ah
[10:54:23] * AlbertoP goes back to try to generalize and read more :-) Thanks shoky 
[10:55:20] <shoky> sure
[11:29:08] <robertparkerx> what is a good method to scroll to an element on page load
[11:37:16] <AlbertoP> shoky, you said I can pass a function without (), but what if I have arguments? :-?
[11:40:23] <AlbertoP> I guess I can just wrap it into a function(){...}
[11:40:26] <AlbertoP> seems messy but...
[11:53:46] <shoky> AlbertoP: either that, or the equivalent:  .load(...,  myFunc.bind(null, arg1, arg2, arg3))   which amounts to the same thing
[11:55:43] <AlbertoP> thanks :-)
[11:55:57] <AlbertoP> I just broke my old code again LOL...
[12:23:53] <AlbertoP> fixed :)
[12:24:17] <AlbertoP> yet another cut and paste which caused more harm than good :P
[13:24:43] <Es0teric> i have this https://kopy.io/Vpt26#line-7 and I want to remove the class that was added from the previously clicked element
[13:24:47] <Es0teric> how would I do that with that?
[13:26:35] <Es0teric> i have this https://kopy.io/Vpt26#line-7 and I want to remove the class that was added from the previously clicked element how would I do that?
[13:33:52] <robertmaxrees> which class?
[13:34:01] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric
[13:34:08] <Es0teric> mi-active
[13:34:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[13:34:30] <robertmaxrees> should only one element ever have that class?
[13:35:16] <robertmaxrees> at a time, i mean/
[13:36:05] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric
[13:39:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees
[13:39:30] <Es0teric> yeah
[13:39:39] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things:
[13:40:18] <robertmaxrees> 1: just do navbar.find('.menu-item-inner').removeClass('mi-active'); at the beginning of your handler
[13:40:58] <robertmaxrees> or actually.
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> $('.menu-item-inner.mi-active').removeClass('mi-active');
[13:45:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees awesome, thanks!
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/728b2a271998 just do this.
[13:50:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees gotcha, thanks again man
[15:53:21] <jackp10> hi to everyone
[15:53:41] <jackp10> does anyone here used fullCalendar before?
[15:53:42] <Gh0st_Preacher> hello
[15:54:09] <jackp10> O I am experiencing an issue regarding the end date being "wrong"
[15:54:20] <robertmaxrees> got a fiddle?
[15:54:59] <jackp10> robertmaxrees: I do not, but the issue I am experiencing I read many other had it. I read a lot of explanation but not real example on how to fix it
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> can you provide links?
[15:55:24] <jackp10> basically, it's about the Ambiguously-timed Moments
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[15:56:20] <jackp10> in the calendar, when I click on the the day to create an event, a modal is opened with the "start" and "end" date
[15:56:41] <jackp10> if I select 17-12-2018", the end date report "18-12-2018"
[15:57:06] <jackp10> now.. if I save it, the fullCalendar add the single day correctly, but when I display it to the user via the modal, the date is +1
[15:57:21] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[15:57:30] <robertmaxrees> so what's the explanation for what's breaking?
[15:57:34] <jackp10> I read it was about this "ambiguous" time Moments, but I don't really know how to solve it
[15:57:53] <robertmaxrees> got a link to that or...? without your code or any other information, there's no real way to help.
[15:58:24] <Caspan> i want to change a column of 10 divs 1-10 and i want the ability to darg an reorder them so i drag #1 down to 3rd position and the others will shift away to make room for it and drop it there
[15:58:34] <Caspan> is there a jquery plugin to do this that anyone knows of
[16:01:10] <robertmaxrees> Caspan lots of options
[16:01:15] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable
[16:21:43] <Caspan> robertmaxrees: Thanks thats exactly what I am looking for
[21:24:17] <jak2000> hi all
[21:25:20] <jak2000> is possible: i have a dialog Form, i check a Total, i want to do: if (inout thext id='Total') == 0 then draw a RED TExt("Completed") in 45 degress in all Dialog Form ?
