[00:15:01] <newatthis> hi. i am trying to get the value of a hidden field in a way that works for a number field but for some reason it does not work for the hidden field
[00:16:37] <newatthis> this is how i am getting the input object       ---------- >               var my_input = $('input[field_index='+ $(target).attr('field_index') + ']').filter("input[my_attr='true']");
[00:17:29] <newatthis> and then i use       $(my_input).val();    to get the val
[00:18:21] <newatthis> i get undefined for val(); but when i console.log the input object it seems it should work
[00:19:03] <newatthis> what am i missing here? am i not filtering as i should / not going about the right way for hidden inputs?
[00:23:17] <newatthis> nevermind - i did something foolish...
[00:41:13] <Everie> hey guys, i'm really struggling with this... $("*").click(function(event){alert(event.target.id)}); works, but i can't find a way to catch 'any <button>' ... tried with $(":button"), $("button") and $("button, input[type='button']") instead of $("*") ...but nothing seems to trigger the alert
[00:43:06] <RiZKiT> how about on? ... you want to use live events not hundreds of events
[00:43:28] <RiZKiT> Everie: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[00:44:24] <RiZKiT> Everie: something like $( "body" ).on( "click", "button", function() {  console.log( $( this ); );});
[00:44:54] <Everie> alright, thanks
[00:45:29] <RiZKiT> this way you can even catch clicks on buttons, which will be added later, e.g. via ajax
[00:45:55] <Everie> i like it
[00:46:09] <Everie> this was quite hate to google my way to
[00:46:29] <Everie> when using click as a keyword ..
[00:46:31] <Cork> ya, and adding click to every element in the page is a super good way to kill performance in the page
[00:46:51] <Cork> so $('*').click is a BAD idea :)
[00:46:51] <Everie> cool
[00:47:05] <Everie> i know, wasn't gonna use it.. just stated that it worked
[00:47:33] <Cork> RiZKiT, Everie: btw use $(document) instead of $('body')
[00:47:36] <RiZKiT> Cork: yeah, was one of my first optimizations at my last job, ie6 loaded the page in about 80 seconds (!), because there were about 8000 events bound
[00:48:00] <Cork> RiZKiT: nice...
[00:48:05] <RiZKiT> Cork: why document instead of body?
[00:48:19] <Everie> yes... why?
[00:48:43] <Cork> RiZKiT: cause document isn't higher to an amount that it matters, and you don't have to go the round tip of document.querySelector('body')
[00:48:52] <Cork> that $('body') does
[00:49:03] <RiZKiT> its the same, so i dont mind using document, just wanted to inspire Everie to use "table", something more capsulated
[00:49:31] <Cork> a better choice is to pick a static parent semi close to where the buttons are
[00:49:37] <RiZKiT> ok, but i hope you agree, the best way would be to find the most common parent of the buttons and use thas one
[00:49:41] <Cork> instead of one that listens to every click on the page
[00:49:46] <RiZKiT> ;-)
[00:49:47] <Everie> so if the buttons are in a <div> container
[00:50:01] <RiZKiT> use this div :-P
[00:50:03] <Everie> i can check for events on the children
[00:50:05] <Everie> ?
[00:50:13] <Cork> Everie: even bubble in the dom
[00:50:19] <Cork> events*
[00:50:43] <Everie> i read that word earlier today too.. the dom bubble thingie
[00:50:45] <Cork> that is why you can bind click on a for <a><span>text</span></a>
[00:50:49] <Cork> and it will still work
[00:51:18] <RiZKiT> most interaction events bouble, except focus/blur and some mouse events
[00:51:19] <Cork> Everie: it means evens bubble through the parents from the element the event actually fired on
[00:51:24] <RiZKiT> bubble
[00:51:31] <Cork> RiZKiT: they bubble too
[00:51:40] <Cork> load doesn't bubble though
[00:51:44] <Cork> or error
[00:52:03] <Cork> i THINK scroll doens't bubble either
[00:52:06] <Cork> but not fully sure there
[00:52:32] <Cork> RiZKiT: or rather focus/blur bubble in jquery
[00:52:39] <fortysixandtwo> Has anyone had any problems in Chrome when you're animation scrollTop? Somehow I end up with a grey area below my content which disappears when clicking anywhere on the page making the whole page jump after the animation has finished
[00:52:42] <RiZKiT> Cork: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/blurfocus.html "The reason focus and blur don’t bubble is that the events mean something quite different on the window and on any other focusable element."
[00:52:43] <Cork> RiZKiT: in native dom you have focusin/focusout
[00:52:51] <Cork> RiZKiT: that isn't in jquery
[00:52:54] <RiZKiT> Cork: well
[00:53:06] <Everie> anyway.. so if i was to catch children of a <div> i do $("#div").on("click","button", function() {// woop}); ?
[00:53:21] <Cork> Everie: if you just want to catch those children yes
[00:53:29] <Everie> ok
[00:53:36] <Cork> $('div').on('click', func) catches all element inside div
[00:53:49] <RiZKiT> Everie: if you have a div with <div id="div">, yes :-P
[00:54:03] <Cork> $('div').on('click', function(event) { event.target <-- is the element actually clicked })
[00:54:08] <Everie> yeah well, i meant a specific div (oddly named "div")
[00:54:12] <RiZKiT> Careful: $('div'), would attach events to EVERY div on the page
[00:54:41] <Everie> alright.. sorry if i scared you with using #div in an example
[00:55:18] <Everie> after reading on this all morning i know there's a different to 'div' and '#divid'
[00:56:12] <Everie> alright
[00:56:17] <Everie> finally got the result i needed
[00:56:20] <RiZKiT> try console.log($('div').length) and console.log($('#divid').length)
[00:56:20] <Everie> thanks for the help :D
[00:56:41] <RiZKiT> as long as there is only one div one the page the results are the same, otherwise not
[00:56:58] <Everie> yeahg
[00:57:00] <Everie> *yeah
[00:57:28] <Everie> i'd prefer to only trigger the objects i need
[00:58:19] <Everie> $("#board").on("click", "button", function() { alert(this.id); }); // please don't freak out that i use alert() .. it's for testing purposes
[00:58:54] <Cork> Everie: i would strongly recommend to never use alert for testing purposes
[00:59:02] <Everie> lol
[00:59:03] <Cork> cause it actually affect code flow
[00:59:12] <RiZKiT> :-P come one cork
[00:59:16] <RiZKiT> on
[00:59:23] <Cork> there are known bugs where it trigger events running twice and so on
[00:59:29] <RiZKiT> Everie: looks fine
[00:59:41] <Cork> so always, always ALWAYS use console.log for code testing
[01:00:03] <RiZKiT> or change the class/css of the button :-P
[01:00:03] <Cork> if the code flow doesn't matter and you want something visual to show, then ya fine use alert
[01:00:04] <Everie> well, i'd usually use "document.getElementById("#console_div").innerHTML = result;
[01:00:17] <Everie> now i'm learning jquery
[01:00:29] <Everie> so i've upgraded to $("console_div").html(result);
[01:00:39] <RiZKiT> which does the same :-P
[01:00:41] <Everie> oops, forgot a # in the example
[01:00:47] <Everie> yup
[01:00:55] <Everie> starting to see why people like jquery
[01:00:59] <Cork> but ya, alert and confirm is nasty and browsers has to do a lot of really nasty workarounds to fake the functionality it tries to implement
[01:01:01] <RiZKiT> so you switch to jquery just for the sake of it?
[01:01:34] <Everie> well, jquery can do alot of things with less code.. (than normal js)
[01:01:41] <Everie> so might as well learn it
[01:01:43] <RiZKiT> but its good you started with vanilla js first
[01:01:56] <Cork> actually now days, not really
[01:02:01] <Cork> the function names are shorter
[01:02:18] <Cork> but the dom is getting much of what jquery offers natively
[01:02:45] <beim> hello, I want to change the style of a save button before submitting the linked form but for some reason the form submits before applying the correct style. can anyone help me? code is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9dde0e4f168e87076f6a
[01:03:06] <Cork> beim: bind submit not click
[01:03:08] <Cork> on the form
[01:03:54] <beim> Cork: the click is on a button that is outside the form, on the last line it submits the form
[01:04:12] <Cork> beim: so set a form="id-of-form" on the button
[01:04:25] <Cork> what you're doing there breaks browser features
[01:05:27] <beim> okay thanks, I'll try it
[01:05:56] <RiZKiT> wow never know this exist
[01:06:13] <RiZKiT> but it seems its not supported in ie
[01:07:28] <Cork> ya, it is a new feature...
[01:07:47] <Cork> beim: might be better to try to extend the form to include the button if at all possible
[01:08:06] <RiZKiT> well sometimes this will not work
[01:08:14] <RiZKiT> extending
[01:08:26] <Cork> i've done what you do in old days (ie5) and had to go through a lot of hops to get ie to work
[01:08:27] <RiZKiT> submiting the form feels legit
[01:08:34] <Cork> it REALLY doesn't like forms without submit buttons
[01:09:01] <RiZKiT> well then put a hidden submit button in the form and trigger it :-P
[01:09:11] <RiZKiT> kidding
[01:09:12] <Cork> and one of the hoop was to add a transparent (not invisible) submit button inside the form
[01:09:17] <Cork> for ie only
[01:09:18] <RiZKiT> :-P
[01:09:53] <RiZKiT> just wanted to mention that the form attribute is not supported in ie10 (!)
[01:10:02] <Cork> <input type="submit" style="background: transparent; color: transparent; border: none; width: 1px; height: 1px">
[01:10:07] <Cork> ^i'm not kidding
[01:10:20] <Cork> though i didn't have the css inline
[01:10:55] <Cork> so ya, always have the submit button inside the form if you have anyway at all to do that
[01:10:58] <RiZKiT> from the moment you mentioned ie5, i was afraid what comes next
[01:11:11] <Cork> RiZKiT: that hack was to get ie9 to work
[01:11:29] <Cork> ie5 actually worked
[01:11:35] <Cork> oh wait ie8 not 9
[01:11:41] <Cork> though 9 does the same thing
[01:12:08] <Cork> its part of there user fraud protection
[01:19:12] <geekman-rohit> testing connection:please ignore
[01:19:41] <Cork> geekman-rohit: then why not start an unpopulated channel?
[01:19:48] <Cork> no reason to spam this one
[01:20:00] <geekman-rohit> Actually that one went through
[01:20:43] <geekman-rohit> i wasnt expecting it to! :D of all the things that one did
[01:24:49] <Omar-> good morning
[01:25:41] <beim> Cork: extending the form is not possible and I can't use the form attribute on the button because of the IE support. Is there any other way to do this?
[01:28:42] <Cork> beim: if you can't get the button inside the form you will have to do the funny dance i talked about before (adding a transparent button inside the form)
[01:28:48] <Cork> and play hoopla with ie
[01:29:01] <Cork> cause it really HATES if you have a form without a submit button
[01:29:23] <Cork> so i very very strongly recommend NOT doing this unless you have absolutely no other choice
[01:29:44] <Cork> from own experience of having to patch over all the cracks as things fall apart
[01:30:42] <sacho> what happens if you have a form without a submit in ie8?
[01:30:58] <sacho> let's say you just collect the input element values and do something with them
[01:31:04] <Cork> from ie8+ you will have problem submitting it
[01:31:16] <sacho> ah ok, the problem is with the form element
[01:31:17] <Cork> i know this is true for ie8 and 9
[01:31:17] <sacho> I get it
[01:31:21] <Cork> possibly 7
[01:31:37] * sacho hasn't used an actual form element in a while
[01:31:42] <Cork> the problem is with password management, ie straight out refusing to submit the form
[01:31:46] <Cork> and other nasty problems
[01:32:04] <Cork> sacho: that is really bad
[01:32:29] <Cork> browsers depend hard on that element actually wrapping the elements to function correctly
[01:32:40] <Cork> it doesn't have to have an action
[01:32:44] <Cork> but the element really should be there
[01:32:48] <sacho> or..?
[01:32:56] <Cork> or lots of things break
[01:32:59] <sacho> like?
[01:33:09] <Cork> enter to submit, password management
[01:33:11] <Cork> and more
[01:33:35] <Cork> basically you don't have a form according to the browser unless it has a <form> parent
[01:33:40] <sacho> yes, exactly
[01:33:57] <Cork> so accessibility goes down the drain
[01:33:59] <sacho> but you're assuming every time you use an input field, you want a form
[01:34:04] <Cork> no
[01:34:09] <Cork> but 99% of the time you do
[01:34:24] <sacho> dwell, I must be coding that 1% most of the time. =)
[01:34:39] <Cork> there are exceptions, like if you have an input field that does js filter of content in the page
[01:34:52] <Cork> but if you submit the data to the server, then ya it is broken unless you wrap it in a form
[01:44:11] <beim> Cork: I got it working by using a callback function, what's your opinion on my method? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/838b4bb8be74a11c01f9 don't mind the function name hah
[01:44:49] <Cork> beim: that shouldn't change anything at all
[01:45:09] <Cork> the code still runs sync so there is only a function jump change
[01:45:32] <Cork> beim: but you will still have a broken form in ie if you don't have a submit button inside the form
[01:45:38] <Cork> and that can't be fixed by js
[01:45:52] <Cork> (unless you create the missing submit button with js)
[01:46:04] <Omar-> I have element with data attribute like this data-groups=["foo"]
[01:46:22] <Cork> ["foo"]??
[01:46:25] <Omar-> console.log($("[data-groups=["foo"]]")); throws an error
[01:46:32] <Omar-> yea :/
[01:46:41] <Omar-> http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/
[01:46:54] <beim> Cork: woah.. it worked just one time.. I feel stupid now, sorry. okay well this seems to be much harder than it looks
[01:47:09] <Cork> Omar-:  or data-groups="[&#x22;foo&#x22;]"
[01:47:09] <Omar-> i'm sure without "" it works
[01:47:14] <Cork> cause the former isn't valid
[01:47:23] <Omar-> Cork or escape ""?
[01:47:51] <Cork> i meant <elm data-groups="[&#x22;foo&#x22;]"></elm>
[01:48:04] <Cork> cause dom doens't suppot \"
[01:48:18] <Omar-> also error
[01:48:22] <Omar-> oh
[01:48:27] <Omar-> i meant in the selector
[01:48:40] <Cork> well i have to know what data you actually have before i can tell
[01:48:40] <Omar-> $("[data-groups=[\"foo\"]]")
[01:49:03] <Omar-> I'm testing Shuffle.js http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/
[01:49:20] <Cork> ok, so you have data-groups='["photography"]'
[01:49:20] <Omar-> it shuffles, shows and hides elements based on data-groups
[01:49:28] <Omar-> yea for example
[01:49:58] <Cork> $('[data-groups="[\"photography\"]"]') should work
[01:50:11] <Cork> Omar-: always, always always quote attribute values
[01:50:14] <Omar-> will test it
[01:50:29] <Omar-> Cork I do, ever since you told me last time ;)
[01:50:36] <RiZKiT> but, single or doulbe quotes are both valid for attributes
[01:50:43] <Cork> Omar-: and yet you didn't in your tries :)
[01:50:51] <Cork> $("[data-groups=["foo"]]") <-- value not quoted
[01:50:55] <RiZKiT> but escaping quotes in attributes doesnt work
[01:51:31] <Omar->             console.log($('[data-groups="[\"family\"]"]'));
[01:51:43] <Omar-> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-groups="["family"]"]
[01:52:08] <Cork> hmm
[01:52:11] <Cork> that should work
[01:52:16] <RiZKiT> how about selecting data-groups and inside read the datagroups value, then you dont need sucha complex selektor
[01:52:47] <Omar-> RiZKiT I want to collect elements based on their group using a variable
[01:53:05] <kesopeso> hi guys... question bout jq mobile + backbone... how to trigger a route change in backone, without changing the hash? is it even possible?
[01:53:05] <Omar-> $('[data-groups="[\" variable here \"]"]')
[01:53:45] <Omar-> kesopeso I'm quite good in jQM but not backbone
[01:54:07] <Omar-> are you using $.mobile.changePage() to navigate?
[01:54:12] <RiZKiT> why not use the format data-groups="foo bar"
[01:54:30] <Omar-> which jQM version are you using kesopeso?
[01:55:04] <Omar-> RiZKiT i can change html but i'm wondering why that selector isn't working
[01:56:11] <RiZKiT> the markup and selector would be much more simple then $('[data-groups~="foo"]')
[01:56:32] <RiZKiT> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/
[01:56:54] <Cork> Omar-: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljoq316d/
[01:57:01] <Cork> ugg lovely...
[01:57:13] <Cork> Omar-: .filter might be a better choice
[01:57:22] <Macaveli> I have 2 submit buttons
[01:57:48] <Macaveli> I have 2 submit buttons, when I press enter in the form the first one is triggered, is it possible to put this action on the second submit button?
[01:58:02] <RiZKiT> http://jsfiddle.net/Ljoq316d/1/
[01:58:03] <Cork> Omar-: so you've found a way to make always quoting attributes not enough :)
[01:58:31] <Cork> RiZKiT: that might match things not intended though
[01:58:41] <RiZKiT> Cork: which?
[01:58:59] <Cork> btw you removed the array from the content
[01:59:01] <Omar-> Cork lol, sort of ;)
[01:59:27] <RiZKiT> yes is did because it is not necessary
[01:59:28] <Omar-> thanks RiZKiT and Cork i'll test your suggestions
[01:59:36] <RiZKiT> is = i
[01:59:58] <Omar-> Macaveli set focus to send one
[02:00:15] <RiZKiT> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/Ljoq316d/2/
[02:00:19] <Macaveli> okie Omar-
[02:00:27] <RiZKiT> "photo" will not match
[02:00:34] <Omar-> Macaveli autofocus attribute
[02:00:40] <Omar-> ?g autofocus
[02:00:40] <b-ot> Omar-: AUTO FOCUS Used Cars Greensboro Advance Alamance Used ... → http://www.myautofocus.com/
[02:00:45] <Omar-> naah
[02:00:53] <Omar-> ?g autofocus html attribute
[02:00:54] <b-ot> Omar-: HTML input autofocus Attribute - W3Schools → http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_autofocus.asp
[02:00:59] <RiZKiT> lol
[02:01:01] <Cork> Omar-: i would recommend using http://jsfiddle.net/Ljoq316d/3/
[02:01:29] <Cork> RiZKiT: jquery has built in support for json in attribute values
[02:01:35] <RiZKiT> Omar-: now you have enough choices :-P
[02:01:41] <Cork> so there are nice parts with actually using that
[02:01:54] <Omar-> Cork the issue is a bit more complicated than this http://jsfiddle.net/7jnd6geo/8/
[02:02:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/Ljoq316d/4/ <-- typo fix
[02:02:27] <Omar-> I want to override Shuffle functionality by collecting "checked" checkboxes and loop through elments with same group
[02:02:42] <Omar-> for some reason I'm complicating things
[02:02:42] <Cork> Omar-: that is why i recommend using the .filter function
[02:02:49] <RiZKiT> Cork: i know, but excaping quotes in complex json string in attributes is a pain
[02:02:55] <Cork> then you can process the elements and getdo what ever fancy you need
[02:02:58] <Omar-> i'll try it, Cork
[02:03:11] <Cork> RiZKiT: it is?
[02:03:33] <neanderslob> hi all, I have an array of arrays (2d) and would like to copy all unique arrays listed to a new variable
[02:03:37] <RiZKiT> Cork: yeah because single quotes arent valid json ...
[02:03:39] <Cork> native object.to_json/json_encode/toJSON/JSON.stringify (what ever language you choose)
[02:03:48] <Cork> and then just html encode that
[02:03:58] <Cork> all languages has built in support for this
[02:04:00] <neanderslob> I've tried using entity UniqueList=$.unique(entityList); but this doesn't cut it apparently
[02:04:20] <Cork> neanderslob: $.unique only works on dom elements
[02:04:28] <Cork> it explicitly says this in the docs
[02:04:51] <RiZKiT> Cork: creating json is no problem, but put escaped json in html, so editing it in an ide is no fun
[02:05:16] <Cork> RiZKiT: ah, you mean by adding it statically in an html file
[02:05:25] <Cork> ya, i don't normally need that
[02:05:30] <Cork> i usually use class for those cases
[02:05:40] <neanderslob> Cork: ah, you're quite right; I'd read it as saying "arrays or dom elements" where it says "arrays of dom elements"
[02:05:41] <Cork> it's what it is meant for after all :)
[02:06:21] <Cork> but i use the json support a lot for where i create complex structure through helpers
[02:06:32] <Cork> and the "options" is stored as a data argument
[02:07:24] <Cork> Omar-: actually, why aren't you using the normal class attribute?
[02:07:30] <Cork> it seams it should support this just fine
[02:08:01] <Omar-> Cork which class?
[02:08:09] <Omar-> .event-item?
[02:08:21] <Cork> <div data-groups=""> => <div class="">
[02:08:21] <Omar-> i'm using it to loop through all items and check their group
[02:08:41] <Cork> you would get faster selectors too so :)
[02:08:45] <Cork> win win ^^
[02:09:08] <Omar-> i know, i'm actually fixing someone else's issue with Shuffle
[02:09:23] <Omar-> he came here last night seeking assistance
[02:09:49] <Omar-> http://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/#usage
[02:10:11] <Omar-> according to docs, data-groups should be a valid JSON array of strings
[02:10:28] <Cork> ya, doesn't mean you have to select based on it though :)
[02:10:31] <Omar-> "The only real important thing here is the data-groups attribute. It has to be a valid JSON array of strings."
[02:14:50] <sacho> Omar-, go over all the divs with data-groups and create a map of group->element
[02:15:00] <sacho> then use the map instead of doing selection
[02:22:11] <Omar-> sacho how? using $.map()?
[02:23:11] <sacho> I don't know the specifics of your problem
[02:29:47] <Omar-> sacho it's complicated somehow haha
[02:29:51] <Omar-> i'm still trying
[02:30:14] <kesopeso> Omar: i went on a lunch break, sorry. yes... i change the pages in backbone router by triggering the jqm .changePage method
[02:30:25] <kesopeso> i also set changeHash to false
[02:30:45] <Omar-> kesopeso yum, i'm hungry
[02:30:48] <kesopeso> the problem is not here, it's actually in backbone part
[02:31:13] <Omar-> kesopeso i assume you have disabled jQM's naviagtion and deep linking
[02:31:21] <kesopeso> i can change pages manually by calling the method that executes when the route is matched...
[02:31:30] <kesopeso> omar: yes
[02:31:33] <Omar-> ajaxEnabled, hashChangeListening, etc
[02:31:38] <kesopeso> if i do this
[02:31:58] <kesopeso> router.navigate('warning-page', { trigger: true });
[02:32:16] <kesopeso> everything works, but #warning-page is appended to the url
[02:32:28] <kesopeso> i just want to get rid of that part.
[02:32:34] <kesopeso> but this is backbone issue
[02:32:54] <kesopeso> so don't worry bout it, if you're not into bb that much
[02:33:24] <Omar-> kesopeso I guess it can be done by listening to pagecontainerbeforechange
[02:36:26] <kesopeso> ok, what about the history api? does the url have to change, for new state to be added?
[02:36:37] <Omar-> kesopeso try this $(document).on("pagecontainerbeforetransition", function (e, data) { data.toPage.jqmData("url", ""); });
[02:37:22] <Omar-> well, jQM updates history "if" changeHash is enabled, which is by default.
[02:37:33] <Omar-> are you using jQM 1.4?
[02:38:16] <tiCeR> Hey guys, i am hanging again with a little problem: https://jsfiddle.net/tiCeR/gow54gvs/1/ -> For some reason it work fine in firefox but does not fire for Safari.
[02:38:18] <Omar-> to know if jQM is updating history console.log( $.mobile.navigate.history.stack )
[02:38:39] <kesopeso> omar yes, 1.4.5
[02:38:58] <Omar-> kesopeso good, try the code above
[02:39:39] <kesopeso> kk, will do
[02:39:42] <kesopeso> tnx
[02:40:58] <Omar-> np kesopeso. I hope it solves your problem
[02:42:24] <Omar-> tiCeR what's not working in Safari? the scollTop animation?
[02:42:42] <tiCeR> No the error message
[02:42:59] <tiCeR>  $('#errornotallfilled').show();
[02:43:00] <tiCeR> this part
[02:43:02] <tiCeR> :(
[02:43:44] <tiCeR> so it does not detect the fields i think
[02:43:52] <tiCeR> because it successfull sends the form
[02:43:58] <negusnegesti> Hello!
[02:43:58] <negusnegesti> Can someone help me, please. How do I manage using an a-tag with href="#" that the page doesn't reload?
[02:44:20] <Omar-> tiCeR pls add your html markup and CSS to the fiddle. it's difficult to pinpoint the problem without enough data
[02:45:16] <Omar-> negusnegesti $("a.selector").on("click", function (event) { event.preventDefault(); });
[02:46:04] <negusnegesti> Omar: will try it, thank you very much!
[02:46:15] <Omar-> np :)
[02:46:39] <tiCeR> it is in
[02:46:51] <tiCeR> maybe the function should be different as i did it
[02:48:01] <effortDee> i have a .on click function for a button (search field) and want the same thing to work with pressing enter
[02:50:11] <effortDee> any ideas?
[02:50:34] <Omar-> tiCeR in the fiddle you have only jquery code but not html :)
[02:50:43] <Omar-> ?g submit on pressing enter
[02:50:43] <b-ot> Omar-: html - Submitting a form by pressing enter without a submit button ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/477691/submitting-a-form-by-pressing-enter-without-a-submit-button
[02:51:00] <Omar-> effortDee ^^ although i dont trust SO
[02:51:02] <tiCeR> http://jsfiddle.net/tiCeR/gow54gvs/4/
[02:51:05] <tiCeR> @Omar
[02:52:00] <effortDee> ty Omar
[02:52:02] <effortDee> let me look
[02:53:37] <negusnegesti> Omar: can I also use it for all a-tags in document ready within a certain page; like this: $(a).on("click", function (event) { event.preventDefault(); }); ???
[02:54:21] <Cork> negusnegesti: side not, but you shouldn't use <a href="#"></a> tags at all
[02:54:27] <Cork> *note
[02:54:49] <Cork> its an old ie5 hack that for some weird reason just never want to die
[02:55:19] <negusnegesti> Cork: interesting, good to know... what to use instead? Leave it empty?
[02:55:28] <Cork> <button></button>
[02:55:49] <Cork> you can style a button to look like a link if you like
[02:56:40] <Cork> negusnegesti: basically <a> tags should always be one of two things
[02:56:47] <Cork> 1. a working url to a remote resource
[02:57:03] <Cork> 2. an id or name that exist on an element in the page
[02:57:10] <Omar-> tiCeR is this the expected behavior? http://jsfiddle.net/cgo7wr3j/2/
[02:57:19] <Cork> all other cases shouldn't be a <a> tag
[02:57:38] <negusnegesti> Cork: that's an alternative ... thanks dudes!
[02:58:21] <Cork> negusnegesti: heh there is one more the magic "home" :)
[02:58:31] <Cork> opps sorry *"top"
[02:58:51] <Cork> that the browser parses as go to top, even if there isn't a id="top" there
[02:59:02] <tiCeR> Omar- yes :) and it does not work on safari
[02:59:03] <tiCeR> ^^
[02:59:06] <tiCeR> i testet also the fiddle
[03:03:54] <Omar-> tiCeR just return false; at the end of $("#submit").click(function () {
[03:04:04] <Cork> Omar-: no
[03:04:08] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/cgo7wr3j/3/
[03:04:12] <Cork> dion't use return false
[03:04:20] <Omar-> why Cork?
[03:04:24] <Cork> it risks breaking scripts in the future
[03:04:34] <Cork> and it is a hell dealing with it then
[03:04:42] <Omar-> how to prevent submit from submitting form?
[03:04:59] <Cork> event.preventDefault() the submit event
[03:05:06] <Omar-> oh true
[03:05:16] <Cork> $("#submit").click(function () { <-- should be a submit event on the form instead
[03:05:39] <Omar-> Cork is correct. http://jsfiddle.net/cgo7wr3j/4/
[03:05:57] <Cork> no that isn't a fix
[03:06:03] <Omar-> $("form").on("submit", function
[03:06:05] <Omar-> ?
[03:06:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/cgo7wr3j/5/
[03:06:24] <tiCeR> Omar- *Klapp into your hands :)
[03:06:30] <tiCeR> thank you so much
[03:06:37] <tiCeR> haha this realy stressed me for 1,5 hours now
[03:06:39] <tiCeR> :)
[03:06:54] <Omar-> tiCeR follow Cork's advice and fix not mine ;)
[03:07:08] <tiCeR> Okay let me see
[03:07:18] <Uhkis> you put WHAT in Omar-'s hands?! :D
[03:07:25] <Omar-> the issue is Safari does partially support "required" attribute that's why it fails. http://caniuse.com/#search=required
[03:07:26] <Cork> lol
[03:07:36] <Omar-> Uhkis $1000 ;)
[03:08:01] <Cork> O_o'
[03:08:06] <Cork> you kiddig...
[03:08:14] <Cork> latest safari doesn't support required...
[03:08:19] <tiCeR> Nice guys thank you very much :)
[03:08:22] * Omar- googles klapp in deutsche
[03:08:33] <Cork> Omar-: clap
[03:08:34] <Omar-> tiCeR bitte
[03:08:57] <Omar-> Cork good, i thought it would something else haha
[03:09:03] <Cork> my language is from the same language family so... :)
[03:09:04] <Uhkis> and we all know what that's a name for!
[03:09:12] <Omar-> Germanic
[03:09:52] <Cork> i think what he means was *high five*
[03:10:01] <Omar-> yea maybe
[03:10:07] <Omar-> or shake hands
[03:10:19] <Uhkis> yeah, giving clap for help ain't a nice reward :D
[03:10:29] <Omar-> lol Uhkis
[03:10:32] <Cork> again similar language base so...
[03:10:40] <Cork> i see what the wording came from
[03:11:03] <Omar-> speaking deutsche is easy if you speak English
[03:11:13] <Uhkis> it is?
[03:11:16] <Cork> uh
[03:11:21] <Cork> i would say no
[03:11:30] <Cork> the grammer is far from similar
[03:11:33] <Omar-> words are a bit similar
[03:11:49] <Uhkis> yeah, like panzerwagen and tank
[03:12:08] <Omar-> but the grammer is definitely horrible
[03:12:19] <Uhkis> we've all seen those germany vs. other world pictures :D
[03:12:36] <Cork> Omar-: actually i would argue that it is english grammer that is horrible
[03:12:56] <Omar-> Cork I agree with you.
[03:13:06] <Cork> german grammer is stricter and less weird "in this case you should do this instead"
[03:13:07] <Uhkis> i agree that Cork must feel that way
[03:13:10] <Omar-> but we can't deny it's simpler than any other language
[03:13:19] <Cork> Uhkis: sadly my language doesn't do that :/
[03:13:27] <Uhkis> Cork: swedish was it?
[03:13:29] <Cork> ya
[03:13:34] <Cork> it loves exceptions
[03:13:39] <Omar-> what's your native language, Cork?
[03:13:44] <Omar-> mine is Arabic
[03:13:44] <Cork> see above
[03:14:22] <Cork> swedish is considered one of the harder languages to learn for this reason
[03:14:45] <Cork> (i think its on top 5 or so, top is russa)
[03:14:54] <Uhkis> i'd say swedish is hard because mycket järnvägsstationen
[03:15:13] <Omar-> Arabic is also in top 10 hardest languages to learn
[03:15:18] <Cork> uh, ya that isn't even grammatically correct
[03:15:42] <Uhkis> well, finnish is #1 from normal alphabets languages!
[03:16:24] <Cork> ugg ya, finnish is... not a favorite language of mine
[03:17:10] <Omar-> http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/why-are-these-the-top-10-hardest-languages-the-world.html
[03:17:50] <Cork> wow, i don't agree with that list at all
[03:17:52] <bacobart> http://www.effectivelanguagelearning.com/language-guide/language-difficulty
[03:17:57] <bacobart> its a clickbait article;p
[03:18:01] <bacobart> the lifehack link
[03:18:08] <Omar-> Cork there many other languages
[03:18:30] <Cork> cause both chinese and japanese is actually really simple
[03:18:48] <Cork> except they use a different set of characters for writing
[03:19:29] <Cork> what i talked about when with difficult is the rules that build up the language
[03:19:39] <Cork> not what you need to go through to start using it
[03:20:16] <Omar-> language grammar
[03:20:22] <Cork> ya
[03:20:26] <Omar-> I'm suffering with Spanish
[03:20:37] <bacobart> well if your native language is english or a germanic language then mandarin/japanse is hard
[03:20:42] <bacobart> it all depends on what you grew up with
[03:20:49] <bacobart> your native language
[03:20:53] <Cork> bacobart: no it isn't
[03:20:58] <bacobart> yeah it is
[03:21:03] <Cork> bacobart: the grammer for japanese is really simple
[03:21:04] <bacobart> http://www.lingholic.com/hardest-languages-learn/
[03:21:18] <Cork> its one of the simplest grammers in the world actually
[03:21:21] <Omar-> bacobart dont forget that pronouncing is affected by native language
[03:21:25] <bacobart> both this site and the other site list japanese/mandarin as hardest to learn for english native speakers
[03:21:34] <deepy> Is there a jQuery plugin for learning languages?
[03:21:45] <Omar-> pronounciation in Spanish is different than English
[03:21:47] <Cork> bacobart: the later link talk about learn time to use the language
[03:21:53] <Cork> not tought ness of using it
[03:21:57] <tiCeR> @Cork  and Omar- sorry i am back the form does not send anymore :(
[03:22:22] <Cork> the complexity of the grammer is what matters there, meaning the number of exceptions and "in this case you should do this instead"
[03:22:30] <Cork> japanese has close to none of that
[03:22:51] <tiCeR> not on firefox and also no more on safari :(
[03:22:57] <Omar-> tiCeR use jquery validation plugin to make your life easier
[03:23:06] <Cork> yes they use pitch instead of punctuation
[03:23:07] <Omar-> ?g jquery validate
[03:23:07] <b-ot> Omar-: jQuery Validation Plugin | Form validation with jQuery → http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[03:23:19] <Cork> but that is just learn phase
[03:26:19] <tiCeR> ok i will try
[04:02:49] <Omar-> when I use $.inArray() first argument is "string" and second one should be an array of strings, right?
[04:06:34] <Cork> ?api jQuery.inArray
[04:06:34] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery.inArray(): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[04:07:03] <Cork> "The comparison between values is strict. The following will return -1 (not found) because a number is being searched in an array of strings:"
[04:07:20] <Cork> $.inArray( 5 + 5, [ "8", "9", "10", 10 + "" ] );
[04:07:32] <Cork> Omar-: does that answer you're question?
[04:22:56] <m_e> i'd like to ceate elements like this: $(".whatever").add("<div>sdf</div>").enter().add("another element").exit().add("yet another element")
[04:23:03] <m_e> is something like this possible with jquery?
[04:23:44] <Cork> no
[04:24:23] <Cork> though you should generally not create large amounts of elements in js
[04:24:36] <Cork> for example a template system might be better for what you're doing
[04:24:52] <m_e> so i would always need select the element i want manually? instead of just walking in and out of the child nodes?
[04:25:14] <Cork> you could create the elements separately
[04:25:23] <Cork> and the add them to the parent
[04:28:26] <m_e> Cork: alright, guess i'll find another way. thank you.
[04:28:45] <Cork> ?g jqote
[04:28:46] <b-ot> Cork: jQote – client-side templating : once upon my code → http://aefxx.com/jquery-plugins/jqote/
[04:28:50] <Cork> ?g mustashe
[04:28:51] <b-ot> Cork: MUSTASHE BANDITS | Facebook → https://www.facebook.com/pages/MUSTASHE-BANDITS/382951453222
[04:28:54] <Cork> ?g mustashe.js
[04:28:56] <b-ot> Cork: Handlebars.js: Minimal Templating on Steroids → http://handlebarsjs.com/
[04:29:07] <Cork> two good examples
[04:30:36] <m_e> Cork: thanks
[04:31:32] <Mement> How would I go about renaming a div after it has been sorted? I want the id to be renamed, based on the position it is. For example this list: http://jsfiddle.net/x6ovuqzh/ -- When #nav1 is moved to the last place, it should be renamed to #nav3 and the other elements aswell.
[04:32:07] <Cork> Mement: loop the list and update the id based on .index()
[04:32:33] <Cork> i don't think sort provides an id update feature
[04:32:49] <Mement> Cork: index(), cool. Let me look into that.
[04:58:02] <jonno11> Hi guys. Can anyone help me debug a hugely simple problem? This code isn't scrolling the window at all. https://gist.github.com/jonlambert/f724da387e10be702699
[04:58:32] <jonno11> I've condensed it down to the simplest code I can - it still doesn't work. I'm not sure how to approach debugging this!
[05:06:06] <BinaryKitten> jonno11 - just tested it - and it does work
[05:06:07] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/3jv0quvz/
[05:06:20] <BinaryKitten> must be something else in your code that is stopping it
[05:11:37] <Cork> jonno11: scrollTop isn't a string
[05:11:47] <Cork> it should be scrollTop: 400
[05:11:54] <Cork> not scrollTop: '400px'
[05:15:54] <BinaryKitten> Cork - weird that it worked in jsfiddle
[05:16:06] <Cork> might be browser dependent
[05:16:22] <Cork> some browser might accept '400px' and convert it to 400
[05:16:28] <Cork> but the value is wrong
[05:17:46] <Omar-> Cork can I PM you?
[05:17:53] <Cork> preferably not
[05:18:05] <Omar-> for personal advice
[05:33:15] <caper> Hey i want to change the format of array [] into {}

[05:34:11] <caper> like on children it show  children":[  {"id":5}]}  ]  i want to remove the [ ]  and want to add the {}

[05:39:51] <caper> sorry [] into {}
[05:40:24] <Omar-> caper you're getting a multidimensional array, this will need extra code
[05:41:19] <caper> if you don't mind can i send you actuall json what i want
[05:41:46] <Omar-> caper sure, put it in a fiddle

[05:49:13] <negusnegesti> Sorry guys to bother you again but one thing is driving me crazy. I get the message "unterminated string literal" when I want to set up a div-container with .html().
[05:49:14] <negusnegesti> I am working with dutch text right now and they have "funny" signs. I tried php's htmlentities() but the error still occurs.
[05:49:14] <negusnegesti> Can you please help...
[05:49:50] <caper> Omar see the JSON that i send you
[05:52:55] <mllie> Hello
[05:53:44] <mllie> Any idea how to solve the problem with submitting a form that returns a file download and then redirect to another page?
[05:55:19] <Omar-> caper you want to override object's key which should be unique
[05:55:51] <Omar-> for example http://jsfiddle.net/rko20c5g/
[05:56:28] <Omar-> if you remove "+ i" in "obj[Object.keys(myArray[i]) + i]", the object will return {id: 1}
[05:58:05] <caper> Omar not this wait see my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/m87vctag/ this fiddle contain what i want
[05:59:38] <caper> i want to remove [] with {}
[05:59:47] <Omar-> caper ok, the object in fiddle is the final result?
[05:59:59] <caper> yes Omar
[06:01:09] <Omar-> caper how does the original array look like?
[06:01:27] <caper> [{"id":13,"children":[{"id":2}]},{"id":1,"children":[{"id":5}]}]
[06:06:07] <Cork> caper: if you do that you would lose the possibility to have more then one child
[06:06:27] <Cork> [{"id":13,"child":{"id":2}},{"id":1,"child":{"id":5}}]
[06:07:42] <serses> it is possible to upload a file through ajax without formdata?
[06:07:48] <Cork> no
[06:08:19] <Cork> only other option is by full page posts (that can be in an iframe for "ajax like feeling")
[06:08:21] <caper> hey Cork but i change whole thing on time of submission
[06:08:38] <mooncup> serses: I think most people use an iframe
[06:08:44] <mooncup> there are many plugins that automate this for you
[06:08:45] <serses> is there any cons of using a iframe?
[06:09:02] <mooncup> I don't think so
[06:09:44] <Cork> caper: not sure what you mean
[06:10:15] <caper> like when i got my full data then i can chage the [] into {}
[06:10:19] <caper> Cork
[06:10:29] <m_e> any ideay how to unbind an event which has been bound with: $(element).on("click", ".class" , function() {...
[06:10:45] <Cork> caper: to display what would happen: {"id":13,"children":[{"id":2}, {"id":3}]}
[06:10:58] <Cork> caper: would become:  {"id":13,"children":{"id":2}}
[06:11:05] <Cork> or possible "id":3
[06:11:20] <caper> wait i show you the full data
[06:12:15] <caper> {{"id":13,"children":{{"id":2}}},{"id":1,"children":{{"id":5}}}}
[06:12:29] <caper> this is i want when i save my data
[06:12:56] <FilipNortic> if u missed that contains is poorly supported and used it quite alot whats the simplest replacement, defining the protype everywere it's used?
[06:15:46] <caper> Cork you got what i want actually while posting i have to save this format
[06:16:08] <Cork> caper: that js isn't valid
[06:16:12] <Cork> *json
[06:16:27] <caper> no it's valid cork
[06:16:29] <Cork> you can't have an object value without a key
[06:16:31] <Cork> no
[06:17:19] <caper> {"children":[{"data":{"id":"0"},"key":"Menu with id = 0","children":[{"data":{"id":"2"},"key":"device","children":[{"data":{"id":"3"},"key":"user","children":[]}]},{"data":{"id":"3"},"key":"user","children":[]}]}]}
[06:17:27] <caper> it's valid
[06:17:43] <Cork> sure
[06:17:50] <Cork> but {{}} isn't
[06:18:47] <caper> yes wait  http://jsfiddle.net/m87vctag/ see this fiddle and copy the whole json then paste in json parser
[06:18:50] <BillCriswell> That's not valid.
[06:18:56] <caper> so you got it
[06:19:03] <BillCriswell> Wait I lied it is.
[06:19:06] <BillCriswell> Misread!
[06:19:11] <BillCriswell> Instead of throwing it in devtools.
[06:19:22] <Cork> caper: test for your self http://jsonlint.com
[06:19:39] <Cork> Parse error on line 1:
[06:19:40] <Cork> {    {        "id": 13,
[06:19:40] <Cork> -----^
[06:20:01] <Cork> Expecting 'STRING', '}'
[06:20:06] <BillCriswell> Cork multi line pasting.
[06:20:10] <BillCriswell> Never thought I'd see the day.
[06:20:16] * Cork blames jsonlint
[06:20:40] <Cork> i wish it had suppot for linking to the result page
[06:21:01] <caper> cork i test it  it's valid one more time plz http://jsfiddle.net/m87vctag/ see this fiddle and copy the whole json then paste in json parser
[06:21:21] <Cork> ah
[06:21:34] <Cork> so you want to convert the array to an object with the index numbers as keys?
[06:21:42] <Cork> or rather index +1 as keys
[06:21:55] <Cork> not sure why you would want that though
[06:22:05] <caper> in key i want to send _
[06:22:06] <Cork> "children": { "1": { }
[06:22:09] <Cork> sure that is valid
[06:22:17] <Cork> or rather
[06:22:25] <Cork> "children": { "1": { }, "2": { } }
[06:22:47] <Cork> send _?
[06:22:54] <BillCriswell> This whole things seems weird and I've only been here for half of it lol
[06:22:59] <caper> i just want to change the [ ]  into {}  and nothing cork dont go  for key
[06:23:08] <Cork> caper: you can't
[06:23:21] <Cork> { key:value } its how you write {}
[06:23:23] <Cork> or you use []
[06:23:34] <Cork> there doesn't exist {value}
[06:24:10] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/kbwood/23AvA/2/ on this fiddle the console show the data
[06:24:20] <Cork> {value} exist in js and that is called an execution block
[06:24:26] <Cork> json doesn't have that at all
[06:24:42] <caper> like  	[{"id":13,"children":[{"id":2}]},{"id":1,"children":[{"id":5}]}]
[06:24:54] <Cork> ya??
[06:26:16] <caper> {"children":[{"data":{"id":"0"},"key":"Menu with id = 0","children":[{"data":{"id":"1"},"key":"device","children":[]}]}]}
[06:26:38] <caper> so it's impossible to change the [ ] into {}
[06:26:48] <Cork> yes if you set a key before the value
[06:26:55] <serses> how would i translate something like this: document.getElementById('file_upload_form').target = 'upload_target'; in  jquery?
[06:27:06] <Cork> ["a"] => { "somekey":"a" }
[06:27:25] <caper> Cork   if i set a key before the value  so i can change it
[06:27:26] <BillCriswell> serses: $('#file_updload_form').prop('target', 'upload_target')
[06:27:48] <Cork> serses: $('#file_upload_form').prop('target', 'upload_target')
[06:28:01] <Cork> BillCriswell: typo :)
[06:28:10] <Cork> it wasn't me this time! XD
[06:28:34] <BillCriswell> Haha
[06:30:03] <caper> hey cork plz tell me how can i change it
[06:30:14] <Cork> caper: you can't do what you're asking for
[06:30:43] <Cork> you can convert ["a"] to { "0":"a" } or something like that
[06:30:46] <negusnegesti> Found the problem... there was a break stored in the database...
[06:30:55] <negusnegesti> Another thing, please
[06:30:58] <Cork> but you can't change it to { "a" }
[06:31:27] <caper> but you told me if i have a key before value then i can change it
[06:31:32] <caper> cork
[06:31:44] <Cork> ya like i said in the next last line...
[06:31:52] <Cork> you can convert ["a"] to { "0":"a" } <--
[06:31:52] <caper> yes
[06:32:05] <Cork> question is, why would you want to?
[06:32:21] <Cork> it makes no sense
[06:32:44] <caper> while posting i have to send the data in this format
[06:33:03] <Cork> in format where you post an array as an object?
[06:33:18] * Cork smells a broken api
[06:33:19] <caper> as an json
[06:33:31] <caper> nor broken api dude
[06:33:52] <Cork> if it expects an array to be expressed as an object with the index as keys; yes it is
[06:34:25] <caper> then plz tell me how can i do that
[06:34:31] <caper> {"children":[{"data":{"id":"0"},"key":"Menu with id = 0","children":[{"data":{"id":"1"},"key":"device","children":[]}]}]}
[06:34:32] <bewilled> Can the dimensions of a dialog be set relative to window's size (em, %)
[06:34:49] <caper> {"children":{{"data":{"id":"0"},"key":"Menu with id = 0","children":{{"data":{"id":"1"},"key":"device","children":{}}}}]}
[06:34:55] <caper> like that
[06:36:21] <Cork> caper: http://jsfiddle.net/23AvA/3/
[06:36:49] <Cork> bewilled: check the documentation, it is well documented
[06:37:02] <Cork> i think "somewhat, but not completely"
[06:37:43] <caper> cork that's i want
[06:37:50] <Cork> caper: but be sure to call it an Object so ppl don't expect it to be an array
[06:38:00] <Cork> cause for example .length == undefined
[06:38:14] <Cork> and .sort doesn't exist
[06:38:14] <caper> last thing i want to know
[06:38:16] <Cork> and so on
[06:38:24] <caper> can i
[06:39:01] <caper> what you change on my fidle
[06:39:18] <negusnegesti> I have been dealing with one issue for weeks now... when I do an ajax request there shall be running a gif... it works fine with mozilla firefox but unfortunately not with chrome, opera, MS IE and so forth... do you have a solution for that behaviour?
[06:39:18] <negusnegesti> Thx in advance!
[06:39:46] <Cork> "running a gif"??
[06:40:04] <negusnegesti> I load an image (gif)
[06:40:05] <Cork> showing a gif?
[06:40:13] <Cork> like a throbber?
[06:40:16] <negusnegesti> yes, showing, displaying ... :)
[06:40:27] <Cork> ?paste @ negusnegesti
[06:40:27] <b-ot> negusnegesti: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:41:01] <negusnegesti> ok, will do so
[06:48:11] <negusnegesti> So, here is the source code: http://jsfiddle.net/1z2bmLz6/
[06:50:09] <Cork> negusnegesti: i would recommend moving the style into css and possibly have the elements as a hidden element in the page constandly (and just showing it with js)
[06:50:19] <Cork> negusnegesti: but what you have there should work just find in all browsers
[06:54:34] <negusnegesti> Cork: is it possible that other included jquery, jqeury ui, etc. .. are blocking one another...
[06:54:35] <negusnegesti> We have this here for example:
[06:54:35] <negusnegesti>         <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">
[06:54:35] <negusnegesti>         <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
[06:54:35] <negusnegesti>         <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js"></script>
[06:54:35] <negusnegesti>         <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js" type="text/javascript" ></script>
[06:54:58] <Cork> ugg no
[06:55:05] <negusnegesti> ok, thx
[06:55:08] <Cork> don't paste html in the channel
[06:55:18] <Cork> its not readable or use for anyone
[06:55:23] <negusnegesti> sorry, won't do it again
[06:55:39] <Thyui> which will be the best way for ::  $("#opciofil td").html()==$("select option:selected").attr("value") where there are 5 td in #opciofil
[06:55:39] <Cork> negusnegesti: http://jsfiddle.net/1z2bmLz6/2/

[06:56:22] <t0th_-_> i have a input, how i can the input first input before them?
[06:56:40] <Cork> Thyui: i would strongly recommend setting a class on the td and use that instead
[06:56:57] <negusnegesti> THX Cork!!!
[06:57:02] <Cork> t0th_-_: "the first"? there is only one value
[06:57:11] <Cork> the current one

[07:16:35] <Thyui> how can I get it
[07:16:42] <lijz> tandroid, iframe i cant use due to some vulnerability test
[07:16:57] <negusnegesti> Cork: I implemented your Example. It works just fine in firefox (again) but not in MS IE ... any idea?
[07:19:15] <Omegakillah> http://jsfiddle.net/1e7qmn27/1/
[07:19:32] <Omegakillah> i tried to use the bind function
[07:19:39] <Omegakillah> but seems like it isn't working.
[07:21:15] <tiCeR> I need to get this function -- $(".subaddforminput").each(function () { --- made as an function like this -- $( "p" ).on( "click", function() { --- so need to get added the each function to it and dont know how to write it :) someone has the solution for me ?
[07:21:56] <tiCeR> so i miss the . on in it that it can also select items that later got added to DOM
[07:22:23] <lijz> ticer wat r u trying to acieve
[07:23:04] <tiCeR> I have a form that gets added new items with .clone()
[07:23:21] <tiCeR> so when i check the form with my function it just gets the first item with that class
[07:23:34] <tiCeR> not the items that got added after the DOM was created
[07:23:52] <tiCeR> so i know that it is possible to get them also with the .on from jquery
[07:23:57] <lijz> put a class for the newly added items and attach a on event
[07:24:08] <tiCeR> but i dont know how to add that to the each function
[07:24:25] <tiCeR> $(".subaddforminput").each(function () {
[07:24:41] <lijz> each is not required
[07:24:56] <tiCeR> but i have more then one item that need to get checked

[07:27:02] <cjohnson> something like that
[07:28:00] <lijz> ticer, while cloning u puy clone(true);

[07:40:14] <jimi_> Why would  item = $('li').find("[data-chatid='158770']"); item.attr('class','foo bar'); work in chrome / firefox but give  object doesn't support method or property attr
[07:42:54] <sacho> probably because that's not the code that's being executed
[07:43:38] <badasafish> I know this isn't exactly the correct room, but I'm having trouble with exceeding the stylesheet limit for IE9 and am looking for some assistance please.
[07:44:34] <jimi_> sacho, that is correct, i have item = $("li").find("[data-chatid='" + data + "']");   being called instead, but data = 158770
[07:45:03] <sacho> make a jsfiddle showcasing your problem
[07:45:56] <sacho> or use a debugger and find out the exact values you're working with
[07:48:45] <jimi_> sacho, trying it in jsfiddle now.... sucks because it works fine in Firefox / Chrome
[07:51:45] <jimi_> sacho, http://jsfiddle.net/wtzjtadp/   <-- fails in IE but works in Chrome
[07:57:26] <MotherMGA> Hello, I'm working with the chosen jquery plugin and I'm finding that it autocomplete=on deosn't work with select boxes that have chosen applied. I can't find any documentation on this. Does anyone know how to get chosen to honor autocomplete requests?
[07:57:46] <negusnegesti> Cork or anyone else, please... Cork was kind enough to provide me with a link http://jsfiddle.net/1z2bmLz6/2/ ... this example doesn't work in any browser but firefox... anyone an idea why?
[07:58:35] <shoky> jimi_: use "var" for that item variable. seems IE has some global "item" function that is messing with it
[07:58:44] <LiENUS> this is probably some wonky firefox javascript bug (i run into a lot of those for some reason) buutt....
[07:58:56] <jimi_> shoky, ok, checking that... weird haha
[07:59:27] <LiENUS> im encountering a case where occasionally (and i cant reliably trigger it yet) one of my dropdown boxes loses its value, it has 3 options and no empty option but for some reason i'll see it go empty, if i submit the form that drop down box is on
[07:59:39] <LiENUS> then the drop down boxes value is left out of the post, it doesnt even have an empty value
[07:59:41] <sacho> non-strict mode is so awful :(
[07:59:46] <LiENUS> nothing is submitted for the dropdown box at all
[07:59:58] <jimi_> shoky, that fixed it.. you are a genius :P
[07:59:58] <LiENUS> any idea what i could be doing with jquery to trigger that?
[08:00:57] <tiCeR> Could you help me that the form get transfered when all fields are filled? I dont know why it wont work... Thank you! -> https://jsfiddle.net/5oLnaoxq/9/
[08:01:08] <LiENUS> i cant seem to find a line of code in my js (only 103 lines not including jquery) that would be triggering that
[08:08:48] <cjohnson> paste your code LiENUS
[08:19:13] <Omar-> !ping arschmitz
[08:19:40] <Omar-> do you consider using data-ajax="false" with forms good practice?
[08:33:47] <arschmitz> Omar-: sure if you want non ajax form submission
[08:34:48] <Omar-> arschmitz: does it have any disadventage?
[08:35:03] <arschmitz> um its not ajax?
[08:35:50] <Omar-> arschmitz pls check this https://forum.jquery.com/topic/browser-jqm-not-showing-the-updated-content#14737000006067032
[08:36:19] <Omar-> using it in that case where no JS/jQ code is involved. pure server-side
[09:09:34] <tiCeR> Hey ya me again :) someone here who can take a look http://jsfiddle.net/5oLnaoxq/10/ ? for some reason the from does not send
[09:10:42] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.
[09:10:51] <robertmaxrees> e.preventDefault() is always running.
[09:11:39] <tiCeR> the problem is when i remove that part the function does not work
[09:12:12] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm guessign you only want it to run if the form isn't completely filled, right?
[09:12:55] <robertmaxrees> probably something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5oLnaoxq/13/
[09:15:22] <tiCeR> yea
[09:15:24] <tiCeR> let me check :)
[09:16:16] <tiCeR> what did you change ?
[09:16:17] <tiCeR> :)
[09:20:26] <robertmaxrees> see what i did with the preventDefault() call?
[09:22:07] <tiCeR> you put it down
[09:22:23] <tiCeR> to the if
[09:22:27] <robertmaxrees> i moved it to only fire in the event that not everything is filled in, yes.
[09:23:14] <tiCeR> so if it went to that function it stops there :) and hold the submit
[09:23:22] <tiCeR> if not if fires the function
[09:23:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:23:38] <tiCeR> i got it :) i need to learn that stuff a bit more thank you very much .)
[09:23:43] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[09:23:54] <tiCeR> so when i enter that e.prevent.. i can stop each function with it ?
[09:24:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:24:07] <tiCeR> but i need to add the e to the function top right ?
[09:24:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:24:34] <tiCeR> $("#addsub").submit(function (e) {
[09:24:35] <tiCeR> here
[09:24:39] <tiCeR> the e must be added ?
[09:24:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah
[09:24:49] <tiCeR> so i can use it on bottom
[09:24:52] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass that object into the function.
[09:25:01] <robertmaxrees> otherwise the argument isn't defined.
[09:25:05] <tiCeR> and the object here is the submit ?
[09:25:07] <robertmaxrees> so the e wouldn't exisst.
[09:25:11] <robertmaxrees> it's the event.
[09:25:23] <robertmaxrees> in this case, the event is the submit.
[09:25:28] <tiCeR> okay
[09:25:44] <robertmaxrees> but there's a lot more to the event object than that.  you can do console.log(e); as see everything in it.
[09:26:19] <tiCeR> okay i will give it a try :)
[09:26:49] <tiCeR> so the first step is to do it all with jquery so the form does not reload but in the back i still should also check with php right ?
[09:26:59] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:27:18] <tiCeR> okay thank you sir.
[09:27:22] <robertmaxrees> always check with the backend - the javascript can serve as a convenience, but end users can modify it to work around it.
[09:27:51] <tiCeR> okay because its client side and the php is server side he cant control right?
[09:27:58] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:28:02] <tiCeR> got it
[09:28:18] <tiCeR> i think i will buy a jquery book to learn it a bit more or should i start with javascript?
[09:28:35] <robertmaxrees> start with javascript imo.
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> tons of great resources out there, many of them free.
[09:28:58] <tiCeR> also some german stuff ?
[09:29:00] <robertmaxrees> jquery has learn.jquery.com which is a pretty good resource.
[09:29:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno about german language stuff.
[09:29:12] <tiCeR> okay
[09:35:00] <ohcibi> is it possible to listen for when a radio button gets unchecked because another radiobutton with the same name is checked? it has a property checked that becomes false eventually, isnt that observable?
[09:35:21] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:35:24] <robertmaxrees> you need an event listener.
[09:35:34] <robertmaxrees> to the "Change" event on those radios.
[09:36:27] <ohcibi> it only fires when it gets checked, not when it gets unchecked
[09:38:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:39:37] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fz1hwszx/
[09:39:41] <BillCriswell> ohcibi: http://jsbin.com/filife/1/edit?html,js,output what's your goal here?
[09:41:14] <ohcibi> I want to bind to the checked property, so I need to listen for when it becomes false
[09:41:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't do that.
[09:41:56] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to do that?  what's the specific problem you're trying to solve in this case?
[09:42:41] <ohcibi> exactly what I have just said... I have an app and I want to bind to the checked property of some radio buttons i order to update some ui when it becomes true or false
[09:43:08] <ohcibi> which is only one use case (the ui)
[09:43:11] <robertmaxrees> you can bind a change event listener and then manually trigger it when you click on other radios, but that's an anti-pattern.
[09:43:13] <ohcibi> but i am not specific about the use case
[09:43:23] <ohcibi> i know and I dont want to do it that way
[09:44:07] <Omar-> on change, check "unchecked" radios
[09:44:10] <BillCriswell> Wouldn't it be false if the value of the radio button isn't what you want?
[09:45:03] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/fz1hwszx/1/ but I dont know if this is a good practice
[09:45:31] <ohcibi> Omar-: its not
[09:47:03] <BillCriswell> Internet is being a peice of shit but basically something liek this? http://jsbin.com/filife/2/edit?html,js,output
[09:47:16] <BillCriswell> Should .toggleClass instead of .toggle but lazy.
[09:48:27] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/filife/3/edit?js,output there we go.
[09:50:47] <Omar-> ohcibi I didnt mean to change state/property of buttons by "check". I meant find out which ones aren't "checked"
[09:54:00] <_DB> sup guys so I noticed something on my page its kind of not a issue but I want to know how to approach it. Basically I have a button when you press it , it grabs information and show it in seperate tabs and inside the tabs is a list of the information with specific ids
[09:54:37] <_DB> theres a edit button that when you press it grabs the values/text/data-attr of the list items and puts it into the correct inputs
[09:55:08] <_DB> in their lies the problem right now one of the tabs doesnt have a date set
[09:55:48] <_DB> which would never really happen since the date field is required to save the information but
[09:56:31] <ohcibi> BillCriswell: its actually a component for a framework and I have a listener for the change event of one single input. I can workaround it nicely in my app using the framework, but I'm interested in fixing the component rather... but it seems that this is hard without becoming ugly...
[09:56:34] <_DB> Im aware that the user can change the text inside of my list using the debug tools , should I add some sort of validation when the edit button is pressed?
[09:56:51] <ohcibi> *gettin
[09:59:30] <BillCriswell> and that's it for me.
[10:00:39] <jonno11> Hi guys. Can anyone help me debug a hugely simple problem? This code isn't scrolling the window at all. https://gist.github.com/jonlambert/f724da387e10be702699
[10:00:57] <ohcibi> BillCriswell: ?
[10:01:12] <BillCriswell> ohcibi: Getting cranky about my internet.
[10:01:20] <jonno11> I've condensed it down to the simplest code I can - it still doesn't work. I'm not sure how to approach debugging this! Asked this earlier, someone suggested that something else in the code might be stopping this from working. How do I find out what might be causing the issue?
[10:02:47] <BillCriswell> jonno11: Try just 400 instea of "400px"
[10:04:08] <BillCriswell> then try not to hate yourself.
[10:07:02] <BillCriswell> Cause that's what I do when I do things like that lol
[10:07:35] <Zzaichik> jonno11: that seems to be working just fine. what browser?
[10:09:14] <jonno11> Zzaichik: Safari, Chrome etc.
[10:09:29] <jonno11> It's almost certainly something interfering with the code
[10:09:34] <Zzaichik> http://jsfiddle.net/anc0L9t7/
[10:09:42] <jonno11> But I need to know how to find out what!
[10:09:43] <robertmaxrees> any way you can show us a broken version, then?
[10:09:53] <robertmaxrees> maybe you have some kind of preventDefault() or something similar somewhere else?
[10:09:53] <Zzaichik> jonno11: Is the page height enough to actually need a scrollbar?
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees> ^ this too
[10:10:10] <jonno11> Unfortunately not :/ It's not my codebase
[10:10:17] <jonno11> I'm just building this in
[10:10:31] <Zzaichik> any errors in the console?
[10:10:48] <Zzaichik> like "$ is not defined"  ;)
[10:10:54] <jonno11> Zzaichik: Nope, and if I add a completion callback, it calls it find
[10:10:56] <jonno11> fine*
[10:11:24] <Zzaichik> huh, strange. Well is it working here? http://jsfiddle.net/anc0L9t7/
[10:11:58] <jonno11> Working fast!
[10:12:00] <jonno11> finr*
[10:12:05] <jonno11> fine* ffs
[10:12:05] <jonno11> haha
[10:12:10] <Zzaichik> lol spit it out...
[10:12:23] <Zzaichik> So.. the problem is, I bet, there isn't enough content to need a scroll bar on the page.
[10:12:25] <shoky> my bet would be that html/body elements are not scrollable, rather an inner element is
[10:12:36] <Zzaichik> or that ^
[10:12:49] <shoky> well we said the same thing pretty much ;p
[10:12:54] <Zzaichik> haha yeah
[10:15:11] <jonno11> Zzaichik: No there's content available
[10:15:23] <Zzaichik> jonno11: content height could be coming in after this animation is being fired maybe?
[10:15:30] <jonno11> But shoky, I'll look into it
[10:15:34] <jonno11> Hmm
[10:15:39] <jonno11> Would that effect it?
[10:15:45] <Zzaichik> yeah
[10:15:56] <Zzaichik> surround that little code bit in a setTimeout()
[10:16:19] <jonno11> Zzaichik: Have tried that, no go unfortunately
[10:16:39] <jonno11> OK client's using Bootstrap
[10:16:41] <phlix> http://pastebin.com/6BZ8fccz Could someone please help me figure out why the top ajax item is working just fine and moving past the success: and the second item will not print anything beyond success. Its almost like its not showing or getting a success. But in the debugger it shows a success and shows the json return and says OK for the url and returns data.. I can't figure out what might be
[10:16:41] <phlix> happening.
[10:17:10] <Zzaichik> jonno11: ahhh, yeah you are probably dealing with some event delegation issues then.
[10:17:25] <jonno11> Zzaichik: Ah right. How can I debug that?
[10:17:38] <Zzaichik> hard to help at this point, I'm afraid.
[10:17:49] <Zzaichik> .off() .on() maybe?
[10:19:00] <Zzaichik> jonno11: have you tried using delay() just to be sure?
[10:19:09] <Zzaichik> .delay(5000).animate({…
[10:20:14] <mbrzuzy> jonno11, what issue are you having?
[10:20:29] <jonno11> Delay is a no go
[10:21:19] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: .animate({ scrollTo: '400px' }, 300); isn't working on my page
[10:21:34] <jonno11> example code here https://gist.github.com/jonlambert/f724da387e10be702699
[10:22:09] <jonno11> Obviously no problem with the code
[10:22:12] <Zzaichik> mbrzuzy: the code is fine, I think it's a conflict with bootstrap.
[10:22:15] <jonno11> there's something interfering
[10:22:58] <mbrzuzy> jonno11: try this: http://hastebin.com/bokuqemaqa.js
[10:23:11] <Cork> jonno11: like i said before scrollTop expects a number not a string
[10:23:38] <tehopeologist> anyone know how http://www.theverge.com gets their responsive menu to stop scrolling at the bottom of it and doesn't have the content of the site scrolling when you reach the bottom?  can this be done with just css, or is js involved you think?
[10:24:23] <jonno11> Cork: Doesn't affect it
[10:25:01] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: No change unfortunately
[10:25:49] <mbrzuzy> How is your javascript added to the page?
[10:26:17] <mbrzuzy> If you run that code through console using dev tools, does it scroll the page? If not, body may not be the scrollable element
[10:26:41] <tehopeologist> mbrzuzy: you talking to me?
[10:26:53] <mbrzuzy> No tehopeologist, to jonno11 :)
[10:26:59] <tehopeologist> ahh okay :)
[10:27:30] <dn5> why doesn't this work: http://jsfiddle.net/brhph1fr/
[10:27:41] <mbrzuzy> tehopeologist, in regards to your question though.  They put a dive overtop of the website they add a CSS style to the body of their site that sets css overflow: hiddne
[10:27:42] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: It doesn't scroll when running in the console
[10:27:52] <Zzaichik> dn5: gotta call it
[10:27:53] <mbrzuzy> then body must not be your scrollable element jonno11
[10:28:02] <tehopeologist> ahhhhhhh that's easy enough for sure
[10:28:10] <tehopeologist> so when the menu's open just overflow: hidden, super simple
[10:28:14] <mbrzuzy> Yep :)
[10:28:25] <dn5> Zzaichik: it's called inside the <a> you can see the onclick is set to call footer()
[10:28:28] <tehopeologist> thank you so much, you're awesome++
[10:28:29] <tehopeologist> <3
[10:28:33] <mbrzuzy> anytime
[10:28:50] <shoky> dn5 because the function isn't global (you have onLoad selected on the left in jsfiddle which puts it in a function). don't use onclick attributes
[10:29:16] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: ahh right. How can I find out what might be the scrollable element?
[10:29:20] <dn5> shoky: oh yea, you were right
[10:29:22] <Zzaichik> dn5: So it's being called before it exists.
[10:29:48] <dn5> Zzaichik: yep, got it, I'm new to jsfiddle, I've put it inside the body
[10:29:55] <Zzaichik> shoky: has a more elegant way of explaining. :)
[10:29:57] <Zzaichik> cool
[10:30:37] <mbrzuzy> jonno11, you would have to inspect your page.  Simplest way would be to start at <body> and go through the children looking at the CSS attributes
[10:30:46] <Zzaichik> And yeah, onclick="" is no longer considered acceptable. (which is why I didn't even see it)
[10:31:08] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: What css attribute would lead me to believe it's the scrollable element?
[10:31:09] <dn5> Zzaichik: what should I use instead? .on() ?
[10:31:25] <Zzaichik> $(element).click(function() { …. });
[10:31:26] <mbrzuzy> jonno11: overflow
[10:31:39] <Zzaichik> dn5:  $(element).click(function() { …. });
[10:31:54] <dn5> Zzaichik: thanks!
[10:32:04] <robertmaxrees> fyi .click uses .on() under the hood.
[10:32:27] <Zzaichik> dn5: http://jsfiddle.net/brhph1fr/1/
[10:32:36] <Zzaichik> just like that. :) yw
[10:33:54] <dn5> is .hide() = .css('visibility', 'hidden') ?
[10:34:02] <robertmaxrees> display: none; iirc
[10:34:03] <dn5> or it's inline "hidden" attr
[10:34:04] <Zzaichik> no, display: none
[10:34:05] <dn5> ah
[10:34:07] <dn5> okay
[10:37:29] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: Hmm I can't see overflow auto about
[10:37:35] <jonno11> or anything like that
[10:37:46] <jonno11> But there's only one element that would be the scrollable one
[10:38:19] <mbrzuzy> try targetting that with the javascript
[10:41:25] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: Doesn't work! This is so annoying
[10:44:28] <mbrzuzy> try jQuery('.elemen').animate(....
[10:44:29] <mbrzuzy> instead of $
[10:44:31] <mbrzuzy> in your console
[10:44:36] <mbrzuzy> on the same element you just found
[10:45:30] <jonno11> No luck - surely if that was the issue it would give a $ is not a function error
[10:45:40] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: really appreciate the help btw
[10:46:00] <mbrzuzy> is your site up anywhere?
[10:46:36] <robertmaxrees> jonno11 and you don't have any filtering applied to your conseole that'd hide certain errors?
[10:49:44] <jonno11> robertmaxrees: nope
[10:50:08] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: I do... but frustratingly the client is pretty restrictive
[10:50:20] <tehopeologist> looks like that didn't resolve my issue with the overflow: hidden stuff =/
[10:50:28] <tehopeologist> it's still scrolling when you get to the bottom of the nav =/
[10:50:55] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: https://www.dropbox.com/s/55tzq7xdtch7m28/Screenshot%202015-02-25%2018.50.47.png?dl=0
[10:51:13] <tehopeologist> mbrzuzy: you think they're using js to do it?
[10:51:51] <shoky> jonno11: do console.log(document.body.scrollHeight, document.body.offsetHeight, window.innerHeight)
[10:51:53] <mbrzuzy> tehopeologist, i'd assume so
[10:52:06] <tehopeologist> =/  damn
[10:52:07] <mbrzuzy> onclick of menu they toggleClass on body or html that changes overflow on the body
[10:53:31] <jonno11> mbrzuzy: 377 377 377
[10:53:33] <tehopeologist> i see they have height: 100% / overflow: hidden when it's open
[10:53:37] <tehopeologist> on html and body
[10:53:47] <tehopeologist> but i'm doing that on mine and it's still trying to scroll ugh
[10:54:08] <shoky> jonno11:  so there is nothing to scroll
[10:54:24] <shoky> jonno11: you're scrolling the wrong element it seems
[10:54:45] <jonno11> shoky: Yeah, but as mbrzuzy accurately said, it's the container that's scrollable
[10:54:51] <mbrzuzy> tehopeologist if <body> is the scrollable element and you add overflow: hidden.  You will not be able to scroll
[10:54:59] <jonno11> unfortunately the code doesn't work when targeted there
[10:55:20] <tehopeologist> i think i figured it out
[10:55:49] <shoky> what container
[10:56:05] <jonno11> https://www.dropbox.com/s/55tzq7xdtch7m28/Screenshot 2015-02-25 18.50.47.png?dl=0
[10:56:15] <jonno11> shoky: It looks like the full-container is the one
[10:56:43] <tehopeologist> sweet figured out the issue, thanks!
[10:57:24] <jonno11> shoky: full-container has a height of 3150
[11:03:43] <shoky> jonno11 oks.. it's too annoying to guess at what you're looking at and what each element's css is set to. you should reproduce the issue on jsfiddle. you don't have to put any proprietary data there and upset any clients
[11:04:03] <shoky> just some html elements and css layout properties
[11:06:50] <tehopeologist> so i got it working mbrzuzy
[11:06:55] <mbrzuzy> nice!
[11:07:03] <tehopeologist> only thing i notice is that when you're halfway down a page and open the menu
[11:07:16] <tehopeologist> since it's overflow: hidden on the content container, it'll put you back to the top of the content container
[11:07:31] <tehopeologist> is there any way to overflow: hidden that section you're on?  or is that just what overflow: hidden does
[11:08:54] <dn5> hey, I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/brhph1fr/3/ ; is there any way to make it a little smoother then poping up?
[11:10:24] <tehopeologist> dn5: instead of using jquery to change the css
[11:10:34] <tehopeologist> have the js add a class to the container
[11:10:53] <tehopeologist> then on that container in the css add a transition to the property you're wanting to smooth :)
[11:14:13] <jonno11> shoky: https://www.dropbox.com/s/a52vjj2155x1das/Screenshot%202015-02-25%2019.13.56.png?dl=0 here's the CSS for full-container
[11:14:22] <jonno11> Well, computed CSS
[11:15:18] <shoky> jonno11: and html, body ?
[11:15:58] <jonno11> Body: https://www.dropbox.com/s/2xhvmcetam3gx0x/Screenshot%202015-02-25%2019.15.40.png?dl=0
[11:16:06] <shoky> jonno11: also did you say earlier that maybe the content isn't in the DOM yet at the time you're calling .animate ?
[11:16:27] <jonno11> HTML: https://www.dropbox.com/s/c91aprvtg7wcm25/Screenshot%202015-02-25%2019.16.11.png?dl=0
[11:16:47] <jonno11> shoky: tried adding a delay to the code executing, and it doesn't work in the console
[11:16:51] <tehopeologist> dn5: here's an example
[11:16:51] <tehopeologist> http://codepen.io/tehOPEologist/pen/GgdVmP
[11:16:54] <jonno11> So I assume that's not the problem
[11:17:56] <dn5> theopeologist: That is great! Let me try to implement it into my code
[11:18:04] <tehopeologist> np ^_^
[11:19:09] <tehopeologist> mbrzuzy: any ideas?
[11:19:48] <mbrzuzy> tehopeologist, whats your issue?
[11:20:20] <tehopeologist> only thing i notice is that when you're halfway down a page and open the menu         since it's overflow: hidden on the content container, it'll put you back to the top of the content container
[11:20:36] <tehopeologist> is there any way to overflow: hidden that section you're on?  or is that just what overflow: hidden does
[11:20:49] <mbrzuzy> it's hard to answer without seeing the page
[11:20:57] <dn5> theopeologist: any way without scss?
[11:20:59] <tehopeologist> i know :(  and i'm in a dev environment =/
[11:21:02] <mbrzuzy> also, that code you posted, you can just use $('footer').toggleClass('open');
[11:21:14] <mbrzuzy> instead of checking if the class is there and either adding or removing
[11:21:22] <tehopeologist> you can see the compiled css by clicking the eye icon in the scss section :)
[11:21:37] <dn5> woops
[11:21:47] <tehopeologist> yeah i do that to ensure the class isn't there in the beginning :)
[11:22:40] <tehopeologist> mbrzuzy: basically
[11:22:46] <tehopeologist> if i'm halfway down a page
[11:22:48] <tehopeologist> and open the menu
[11:22:57] <arthurvr> Hi all!
[11:22:58] <tehopeologist> it'll jump to the top of the page
[11:23:11] <shoky> jonno11: welp it might be the overflow-x: hidden  on body/html
[11:23:13] <tehopeologist> ideally i'd like it to stay where you are and open
[11:23:33] <jonno11> shoky: how might that affect it?
[11:23:49] <tehopeologist> i guess i thought that when you envoke overflow: hidden it does it right there, and not starting from the top of the element..
[11:24:49] <shoky> jonno11: sometimes setting overflow-x to hidden also does the same implicitly for overflow-y. browser-dependent, don't remember the details
[11:25:48] <shoky> jonno11: http://jsfiddle.net/exgktjup/  remove the overflow-x:hidden here from  either body or html and see the difference and the scroll working
[11:26:35] <jonno11> Ah yeah ok
[11:26:41] <jonno11> shoky that makes sense
[11:27:01] <jonno11> but now, how can I animate full-container?
[11:28:21] <dn5> tehopeologist: may I ask why did you go backward in height? isn't it better to scroll footer to top instead to reverse?
[11:28:35] <shoky> jonno11 i don't think that's the element you want to be scrolling. first of all,  is removing overflow-x:hidden  from your css  doable? or does it ruin your layout
[11:28:43] <tehopeologist> it was just an example
[11:28:56] <shoky> jonno11: if you're fine with removing it, i'd think animating body,html should work
[11:29:01] <jonno11> shoky: I think their using an off-canvas hamburger menu
[11:29:02] <tehopeologist> i don't know how you want it exactly, it was just a way of showing how the transition worked
[11:29:25] <dn5> tehopeologist: ah, I thought there was a point in that
[11:29:35] <tehopeologist> i did bottom: -100px to hide it
[11:29:51] <tehopeologist> and overflow: hidden on the body so the body wouldn't scroll to show it
[11:30:00] <tehopeologist> then bottom: 0 when the class is attached to the footer
[11:31:12] <dn5> ahh I got it
[11:31:38] <tehopeologist> ^_^
[11:36:25] <acidjazz> dump questions i know but
[11:36:27] <acidjazz> im blanking
[11:36:35] <acidjazz> if i set a document.ontouchdown handler how do i remove it?
[11:37:25] <Cork> document.ontouchdown = null
[11:37:43] <Cork> if you use the property form
[11:37:54] <Cork> if you used .addEventHandler you use removeEventHandler
[11:41:23] <dn5> lets say I have: <i class="fa fa-chevron-up"> ; how am I suppose to change class of that particular <i> tag?
[11:42:23] <robertmaxrees> .addClass() and .removeClass()
[11:42:37] <robertmaxrees> or use .attr() / .prop()
[11:43:06] <dn5> robertmaxrees: I want to replace fa fa-chevron-up to other class, not remove it
[11:43:17] <robertmaxrees> "replace to another class"?
[11:43:25] <_DB> to change the src of a image $(this).attr("src", urlAbsolute) ?
[11:43:38] <dn5> _DB: yes
[11:44:02] <dn5> robertmaxrees: <i class="fa fa-chevron-up"> on action should be <i class="fa other-class">
[11:44:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want to .removeClass('fa-chevron-up') and then .addClass('other-class');
[11:44:38] <_DB> thanks also lets say I have 2+(11 max) images that I will be changing the src of when the user clicks something should I add some form of preloading?
[11:44:57] <robertmaxrees> depends on the image size.
[11:45:10] <dn5> ohhhh.. yes you were right
[11:45:15] <dn5> stupid me
[11:45:25] <acidjazz> Cork: thatll work just as fine as unbind?
[11:45:38] <acidjazz> Cork: i never knew there was a .remove
[11:45:41] <_DB> 640 x 480
[11:45:47] <Cork> acidjazz: .unbind is for jquery
[11:46:11] <Cork> and no elm.on<event name> can't be removed with .unbind/.off
[11:46:15] <robertmaxrees> _DB i meant more filesizes, but i wouldn't worry about preloading in that case.
[11:46:25] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:46:30] <_DB> alright
[11:46:37] <robertmaxrees> Cork .off() is to remove things added with .on()
[11:46:46] <Cork> acidjazz: .removeEventListener is what .off/.unbind uses
[11:47:00] <Cork> robertmaxrees: .unbind is just an alias for off
[11:47:14] <robertmaxrees> i thought jquery events and native dom events are distinct from one another.
[11:47:32] <Cork> they are, that is what i just said :)
[11:47:40] <kongthap> i have a question about using $.when() http://pastie.org/9982126, calling one function it's just fine, but calling 2 functions i must refer to array's index, what went wrong here, please hint?
[11:47:49] <acidjazz> i thought what you said is actually what jquery does
[11:48:03] <acidjazz> what do you mean by distinct
[11:48:18] <acidjazz> if .off is .unbind, is .on then .bind ?
[11:48:23] <Cork> acidjazz: jquery provides help ontop of addEventListener/removeEventListener
[11:48:35] <sacho> kongthap, well unfortunately $.when() has an awful api :) http://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[11:48:47] <robertmaxrees> native dom events and jquery events aren't the same.  adding an event binding using raw dom methods is not the same as adding an event binding using on.
[11:48:57] <Cork> so .unbind requires that the event is bound with .on/bind for it to be able to remove it correctly
[11:49:18] <Cork> robertmaxrees: that isn't fully true
[11:49:20] <sacho> kongthap, oh wait. I must be thinking of another function
[11:49:33] <kongthap> sacho, ok :)
[11:49:42] <acidjazz> Cork: seems to be working for me so far
[11:49:43] <Cork> most jquery events aren't much more then native events
[11:49:56] <robertmaxrees> Cork it sits "on top" of the DOM event handling suite, suite, but you can't remove native bindings using jquery, and vice versa.
[11:50:17] <Cork> robertmaxrees: haven't actually tried, but it should work
[11:50:24] <sacho> kongthap, do you have an example on jsfiddle? that shouldn't be happening
[11:50:35] <Cork> but triggering native events for example doesn't work from .trigger
[11:51:11] <shoky> kongthap: it's because the ajax success callback receives 3 arguments. so you're getting an array of those 3 arguments
[11:51:12] <kongthap> sacho, what should i do, the data come from php, jsfiddle is ok for this?
[11:52:33] <sacho> well, you could also use a debugger and inspect the data, and tell us the difference
[11:52:33] <kongthap> shoky, is this normal? as i mentioned when calling just one function in $.when() i only use data without [] it's just fine :(
[11:52:46] <sacho> shoky, really?
[11:52:49] <shoky> kongthap: it's the expected behaviour yes
[11:53:01] <shoky> kongthap: otherwise you wouldn't be able to access the other arguments (if you wanted to)
[11:53:16] <sacho> oh right, /me read the docs
[11:54:37] <_DB> can I have an array that skips values? like array[1]="blah", array[6]="blah" etc?
[11:54:49] <shoky> kongthap: maybe this makes it clearer  http://pastie.org/9982158
[11:55:07] <kongthap> sacho, can i use picture to show you? http://i.cubeupload.com/hFUvDb.png, the first set is console.log(data[0]), the second (red) console.log(data);
[11:55:10] <shoky> kongthap instead of getting 6 arguments you're getting 2 arrays of 3
[11:55:25] <shoky> kongthap: data is not the only argument
[11:55:44] <Cork> robertmaxrees: yup, doesn't work though that one would actually http://jsfiddle.net/7hd4kjen/
[11:56:03] <Cork> and it used to a while back :)
[11:56:08] <Cork> prob pre 1.5
[11:56:17] <Cork> events changed a lot in jquery back then
[11:57:16] <sacho> ughh
[11:57:22] <kongthap> shoky, you're right when calling one function i just get first argument out of 3, that was why
[11:57:26] <sacho> you can actually deferred.resolve(with,many,values) :(
[11:58:16] <kongthap> shoky, so this is just normal, if i expect only using data (first argument), nothing to fix right?
[11:59:12] <sacho> yeah
[12:00:23] <kongthap> thanks sacho, shoky
[12:00:41] <sacho> thank shoky =)
[12:00:51] <shoky> np ;]
[12:09:17] <notchris> If I check a selector for the class “active”
[12:09:25] <notchris> Will it work if “active” is added after page load
[12:10:08] <tandroid> You have to reselect the element.
[12:10:27] <tandroid> No wait, that's not true.
[12:10:36] <tandroid> I actually don't remember.
[12:10:47] <tandroid> *backs away slowly*
[12:12:03] <notchris> Hmm
[12:42:51] <TeddyMurray> is there a way to go up three parents? something short for: $.parent().parent().parent()
[12:44:00] <BillCriswell> TeddyMurray: There's .closest('.some-selector') which might be useful to you.
[12:44:07] <TeddyMurray> oo thank you
[12:44:11] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[12:45:26] <BillCriswell> The other option would be plucking from .parents() but that wouldn't be as efficient.
[13:11:12] <bewilled> I'm putting a multipage javascript form inside a jquery dialog, and when I hit next, it triggers an unwanted scroll on the page, and repositions the dialog. Any ideas on how to fix this? or another suggestion(use other component)
[13:12:31] <robertmaxrees> is "next" an anchor tag with an href?
[13:13:05] <_DB> I noticed I can add comments inside of append('hey' + //comment @/n<-new line  'hiyo');
[13:13:19] <_DB> would I be able to add a if inside also? or should I just add it prior?
[13:13:31] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't abuse comments that way.
[13:13:56] <_DB> :[ so I shouldnt abuse ifs like that either?
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> use them inline for condition append stuff?  no.
[13:14:22] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be wayy difficult do read.
[13:14:37] <_DB> its already incredibly difficult to read "[
[13:14:44] <robertmaxrees> don't make things worse.
[13:14:45] <_DB> I have 4 if statements
[13:14:52] <_DB> each has a giant append script attached to it
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like bad data.
[13:15:14] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, next is an input button
[13:15:30] <robertmaxrees> bewilled we'd have to see an example of the scroll, then.
[13:15:41] <robertmaxrees> _DB you could use a conditional instead of an if, but you have to be careful because those can get WAY confusing.
[13:16:04] <_DB> its actually how the page is set up when the user clicks a button im grabbing a sub class of a object which basically object a has 3 sub classes and each of those subclasses has 5 data fields that can be changed
[13:16:34] <_DB> I hear that
[13:16:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't see what in that requires a bunch of if statement.s
[13:17:04] <_DB> well the tab system im using has a active class so I have to check if its the first one to add that class to it
[13:17:41] <_DB> and prior to that if statement I have to check if it has any subclasses
[13:17:54] <_DB> if not then create a empty tab with sub class creation form
[13:17:58] <robertmaxrees> bewilled please don't PM me.
[13:18:06] <robertmaxrees> if it's got adult content, remove it.
[13:18:08] <robertmaxrees> focus on the code.
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> _DB sounds like you need better state management.
[13:19:20] <_DB> well I could get rid of two of those ifs now that I think about it..
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:19:46] <_DB> I could just  grab  the data.subclass.id.[0] and manually add in the class to its div
[13:20:11] <_DB> that would get ride of some 50 lines of code.. lol
[13:20:15] <_DB> thanks for that advice haha
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> ;) don't be overly terse. but keep things readable.
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> also: functions are amazing.
[13:21:00] <robertmaxrees> don't just use them to reduce repeated logic, use them to give names to logic, too.
[13:22:06] <_DB> I hear ya I might end up sending that giant append script to a function for the sake of readability.
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> what all is it doing?
[13:29:29] <_DB> well basically it grabs all the subclasses of the object I want to view a maximum of 11 classes
[13:29:35] <robertmaxrees> "subclasses"?
[13:29:45] <Duvdevan> robertmaxrees, you know
[13:29:51] <robertmaxrees> are you faking classical inheritance in JS?
[13:29:57] <Duvdevan> subclass Eclass extends XXX {}
[13:29:59] <Duvdevan> heheh
[13:30:00] <_DB> yeah basically I have a object , and that object has multiple language
[13:30:10] <_DB> oh no I have it set up on php
[13:30:18] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[13:30:22] <_DB> but Im displaying the info on javascript at times XD
[13:30:35] <robertmaxrees> please tell me you're not generating javascript code...
[13:30:41] <Duvdevan> ;DDDD
[13:30:48] <_DB> no im generating html
[13:30:48] <robertmaxrees> :(
[13:30:51] <robertmaxrees> okay cool.
[13:31:04] <_DB> yeah lol XD I would never genrate javascript haha
[13:31:10] <Duvdevan> man, I tought I was on #php channy
[13:31:15] <Duvdevan> what a trip
[13:31:53] <_DB> haha
[13:47:05] <acidjazz> GUSY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ
[13:47:51] <robertmaxrees> wait what
[13:47:53] <robertmaxrees> oh no
[13:47:58] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, Its very messy, but it replicates the problem: click on open dialogue, and the click next, you'll see how it scrolls down http://jsfiddle.net/q178Lvtf/

[13:48:50] <robertmaxrees> bewilled...
[13:48:55] <robertmaxrees> there's a porn ad in ther.e
[13:49:11] <robertmaxrees> also; that's not a test-case.
[13:50:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm at work homeslice. uncool.
[13:50:40] <TeddyMurray> wow lol
[13:51:22] <robertmaxrees> why would you just copy/paste the source of an entire porn site page, stick it in a fiddle, save that, and send that out and expect that to go well?
[13:57:56] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, I had ad block turned on so I didn't see the add when cleaning up the code
[13:58:09] <robertmaxrees> don't "Clean up the code" - create a test case.
[13:59:20] <rubyonrailed> I'm trying to select the last select option when this line is ran : "$('#permissions_permission_1_plan_type option:selected').val($("#permissions_permission_1_plan_type option:last").val());" This doesn't seem to be working though.
[14:01:02] <pl2> Hello, I have a mouseover event attached to an element. But when I hover over this element and then onto a child element within it, the mouseout event is triggered. How does one prevent this?
[14:06:43] <bewilled> robertmaxrees, I cut off the add now http://jsfiddle.net/8fmd05tj/ click on Open Dialog and then on next page to detonate the unwanted scroll displancement
[14:09:17] <Dr-007> anyone knows bootstrap and the container option? i'm trying to assign a tooltip or confirmation to an li item. but these things only seem to apply to <a hrefs>
[14:11:01] <Dr-007> pl2: use $('.something').mountover().click()
[14:11:05] <Dr-007> pl2: use $('.something').mouseover().click()
[14:11:50] <pl2> Dr-007, thanks for the reply.. how does adding click help?
[14:12:35] <Dr-007> yeah your right
[14:12:40] <Dr-007> you should add mousedown
[14:13:11] <Dr-007> oh never mind
[14:13:14] <Dr-007> i read it wrong
[14:13:25] <Dr-007> i thought you were clicking and dragging
[14:13:47] <Dr-007> but then try
[14:14:04] <pl2> no problem ;) Just trying to prevent the child elements from interfering with mouseover and mouseout
[14:14:23] <Dr-007> $('.something, .something .within, .something .within .within')

[14:16:37] <Guest92104> hi quick question... I have jquery included i my html doc (2.1.3) and i am trying to use .offset(), but i keep getting an error in my console that it's undefined. Why would that be the case?
[14:16:45] <Guest92104> it works in a jsfiddle though..
[14:19:02] <junaidjee> please anybody check this http://jsfiddle.net/ynd8thfk/1/
[14:19:05] <junaidjee> please
[14:20:21] <junaidjee> hello
[14:20:26] <junaidjee> anybody help please
[14:22:07] <Guest92104> here's the fiddle for reference http://jsfiddle.net/u4bjrmxc/
[14:22:22] <Guest92104> fiddle is using 2.1.0 though... would that really make a difference?
[14:23:15] <Dr-007> Guest: you're probably trying to use jquery without having it fully loaded
[14:23:33] <Dr-007> so use .ready() handler to fix that
[14:23:40] <Dr-007> and check if you've really included jquery
[14:23:54] <Guest92104> i have it all in $(window).load(function(){
[14:23:55] <Dr-007> junaidjee: be more specific..
[14:24:45] <junaidjee> yes
[14:24:48] <junaidjee> please tell me what to do
[14:24:49] <junaidjee> jquery is loaded
[14:25:32] <junaidjee> i want to match hreflang and then change its href
[14:25:56] <junaidjee> please anybody
[14:26:20] <Guest92104> any function in $(window).load() should execute when everything is fully loaded.
[14:26:48] <junaidjee> are u with me
[14:26:54] <junaidjee> ?
[14:27:04] <Guest92104> no, I'm trying to resolve my issue juna
[14:27:32] <junaidjee> ok please help me check http://jsfiddle.net/ynd8thfk/1/
[14:28:10] <Guest92104> once i resolve my issue, I'll be happy to check
[14:28:13] <Guest92104> please be patient
[14:29:44] <Dr-007> junaidjee: use $.each to itera each link and then use $(el).attr('hreflang'); to determine the language
[14:29:50] <Dr-007> then do your switcharoo
[14:30:46] <junaidjee> DR-007 how to change attrib then
[14:30:58] <Dr-007> Guest92104: have you checked your jquery yet? via firefox > document source > click on jquery.js file. then see if you dont get a 404 error
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> $('link').each(function() { $(this).attr('href', 'newHref') });
[14:31:06] <junaidjee> can you please change code on http://jsfiddle.net/ynd8thfk/1/
[14:31:22] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(document.ready(function($){ isn't valid btw.
[14:31:24] <Dr-007> junaidjee: what robertmaxrees says
[14:31:26] <junaidjee> i will be thankful to you please
[14:31:46] <Guest92104> Dr-007: yes, i get a 304. loaded, and not modified from last load
[14:32:25] <Dr-007> Guest: then i dont know

[14:33:09] <junaidjee> how to change it
[14:33:52] <tw2113> change jQuery(document.ready(function($){
[14:33:57] <tw2113> to jQuery(document).ready(function($){
[14:34:11] <junaidjee> omg
[14:34:14] <junaidjee> i not check
[14:34:15] <junaidjee> wait
[14:34:26] <robertmaxrees> or just jQuery(function($){});
[14:36:00] <TheEternalAbyss> ok back on my own nick
[14:36:10] <junaidjee> check now it is still not working http://jsfiddle.net/ynd8thfk/2/
[14:36:24] <TheEternalAbyss> so yea... i was the guy with the $(window).load() and offset being undefined issue
[14:36:55] <robertmaxrees> junaidjee use .each() to make this even easuier.
[14:38:51] <junaidjee> extra ) found
[14:38:54] <junaidjee> let me check
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:41:23] <TheEternalAbyss> ah.....
[14:41:44] <TheEternalAbyss> ok user error was the problem. I had two ID's in my html... no wonder jquery got confused
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:42:03] <TheEternalAbyss> :P
[14:42:14] <TheEternalAbyss> happens to the best of us hehe
[14:43:03] <Dr-007> robertmaxrees: do you know something like the bootstrap.confirmation() button but then with three definable buttons?
[14:43:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:44:29] <Dr-007> something like: http://mistic100.github.io/Bootstrap-Confirmation/
[14:45:08] <robertmaxrees> do you just want the popups or what?
[14:46:16] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'd end up just rolling my own probably.
[14:46:16] <Dr-007> yes, i want a confirmation box that has no html 'work' to be done but has the ability to add more buttons than just the 2 "ok" and "cancel" buttons
[14:46:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you'll need to write your own html i guess.
[14:46:34] <Dr-007> yeah i was affraid of that
[14:46:45] <robertmaxrees> why afraid?  should be pretty easy.
[14:47:21] <Dr-007> afraid of extra work.. ;) i've been moving around with this tiny function for a while now
[14:48:15] <Dr-007> its a tagit list with autocompletion stuff inthere, and when you click a tagit button you should have three options. visit the item. delete the item. or add a code hint to the document
[14:48:31] <robertmaxrees> check out powertip.
[14:48:42] <robertmaxrees> i kind of like that one personally, but you'll still have to write code.
[14:50:37] <Dr-007> http://jsfiddle.net/Wf2BR/1/
[14:50:40] <Dr-007> its ok
[14:50:48] <Dr-007> thanks for your input
[14:50:59] <robertmaxrees> i know about that - i used to work with the guy who wrote it ;)
[15:30:21] <jcrawford> hey guys I am doing something like el.parent().parent().find('a').each(function(idx item) { console.log(item); item.removeClass('active'); }) but when i log item it is an HTML string and not an object
[15:30:38] <jcrawford> how can i make sure that i get back an object which removeClass, etc can be called on?
[15:30:44] <robertmaxrees> $(item)
[15:30:51] <robertmaxrees> you're accessing the raw DOM node otherwise.
[15:30:56] <robertmaxrees> you can also just use $(this)
[15:31:01] <jcrawford> ah ok cool thanks
[15:31:47] <jcrawford> thanks again, sorry newb here :)
[15:32:43] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[15:44:31] <Dr-007> who knows how to add text via javascript into a codemirror textarea
[15:44:39] <Dr-007> its a longshot.. i know
[15:44:40] <Dr-007> :p
[15:44:49] <robertmaxrees> codemirror?
[15:45:12] <robertmaxrees> ah.

[15:51:13] <riche> https://jsfiddle.net/3xjqxxfv/1/ how do I make it stop after 2 decimal places?
[15:57:57] <Dr-007> what line number are we looking at riche?
[15:58:24] <Dr-007> and what numbers should i enter? # of PPO / WC Surveys
[15:58:57] <riche> just enter 3 then 8 and calculate
[15:59:23] <riche> then it goes .9999999999 for the last two, but it could be any number of combinations that could change the results
[16:02:25] <Dr-007> well good sir, it does nothing overhere in firefox
[16:02:37] <Dr-007> ReferenceError: rev is not defined
[16:03:47] <Dr-007> but that seems to bee a fiddle problem in moo-client.js

[16:19:49] <riche> How do I make a number stop 2 decimal places for calculations, like 100.21

[16:24:13] <robertmaxrees> quick google search woulda told you, too :)
[16:24:47] <riche> i tried lol >.< but everything was confusing, that link seems to be more helpful though ty :)
[16:39:25] <riche> does it have to be .val to .toFixed(2) ? It's not working on my .text if that makes any sense.
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> .toFixed() expects a number.
[16:39:38] <robertmaxrees> you have a string.
[17:11:08] <riche> how do I change my variables to numbers... I think

[17:30:25] <richie> dc'd
[17:32:20] <Kamuela> how do you select everything _but_ something?
[17:35:49] <wontoner> kamuela: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/ - possibly with the not selector
[17:42:06] <Kamuela> wontoner: $('body:not(h1)') isn't behaving as i'd expect
[17:43:01] <robertmaxrees> $('*:not(h1)');
[17:43:07] <robertmaxrees> but that's gonna be kinda... slow.
[17:43:54] <wontoner> I think you would want something more like: $('h1').not('#specific_id')
[17:43:54] <robertmaxrees> Kamuela why are you trying to do that?
[17:44:48] <Kamuela> I'm trying to make the body fade in while keeping h1 loaded in place
[17:46:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:46:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd consider overlaying a div that has that h1 in it and fading that instead.
[17:46:39] <robertmaxrees> because that can be real slow otherwise.
[17:47:18] <Kamuela> well it's a fade-in on load so that slowness doesn't matter so much. that being said, body.fadeIn works as expected. so body excepting h1 should as well, shouldn't it?
[17:47:28] <wontoner> possibly you want two div elements within the body. 1 is your h1 container and the other contains the rest of what you want to display.
[17:47:41] <richie> robertmaxrees how close am i
[17:47:47] <richie> https://jsfiddle.net/3xjqxxfv/26/
[17:47:49] <wontoner> changing body will impact everything on the page.
[17:48:00] <robertmaxrees> Kamuela yeah, you need to target everything else individually.
[17:48:13] <robertmaxrees> richie ... what line?
[17:48:32] <richie> for it to make it calculate
[17:48:36] <wontoner> div1.fadeIn, div2.fadeOut
[17:48:36] <richie> is there something I need to change
[17:48:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:48:46] <richie> calculate button isnt working
[17:48:48] <robertmaxrees> richie open your console duder.
[17:49:48] <richie> rev is not defined
[17:49:48] <richie> hmm
[17:49:49] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't make sense right now - $(function calculate () { probably isn't what you want.
[17:49:56] <richie> oh
[17:51:31] <Kamuela> robertmaxrees, wontoner: so basically i should wrap everything that doesn't contain my h1 in a class that i fade in, and then let h1 remain? because body isn't a clean way to deal with selectors?
[17:51:44] <robertmaxrees> Kamuela that's going to be very slow.
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> because you're going to animate a whole bunch of individual elements.
[17:52:27] <Kamuela> whereas if i consolidate my divs it'll be faster
[17:52:43] <wontoner> Kamuela: body would contain also the h1 tag. your action would apply to everything.
[17:53:16] <Kamuela> so we're saying that any formulate of body NOT h1, would require h2, p, etc etc to individually be acted on by jquery
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> just create an overlay div instead.
[17:54:07] <wontoner> body->(h1,othercontent) .. on the DOM -document object model- body contains all the tags of the page.
[17:54:28] <robertmaxrees> Kamuela yes.
[17:55:11] <wontoner> your thinking is mostly correct but you need to add some container divs possibly to get the desired visual effect.
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> i still wouldn't do that, because that's munging the concept.
[17:57:18] <Kamuela> class fade-in-on-load to add .fadeIn to, makes sense to me
[17:57:23] <wontoner> Kamuela: maybe if you put your code on jsfiddle.net it would be easier to advise you
[18:00:09] <wontoner> Kamuela: http://www.mkyong.com/jquery/page-loading-effects-with-jquery/
[18:09:04] <jj15> When I prepend an element to a list, is that element available in the DOM to select?
[18:11:02] <limbera> i'm using jquery to submit a form, but i can't get it to work
[18:12:03] <limbera> here is the form and the javascript: http://dpaste.com/23J8V30
[18:12:19] <limbera> this function $('#payment-form').submit(function(event)
[18:12:27] <limbera> should be called when the submit button is pressed
[18:12:29] <limbera> but it isn't being called
[18:14:54] <wontoner> limbera: do you have a developer tool add-on? is the console saying anything?
[18:15:13] <limbera> nothing in the console
[18:15:47] <wontoner> try dropping your code into JSlint
[18:19:20] <limbera> is it because of the field sets maybe?
[18:19:44] <limbera> and this: $('#payment-form').submit(function(event) can't understand that the submission from within a field set was for the entire form?
[18:19:53] <MrFlanny> Hi, need some quick assistance if possible.  I'm trying to figure out how to select the first textarea that comes after an input with the value "on tap" ... anyone got some advice? gracias
[18:21:13] <wontoner> http://www.jslint.com/ - try dropping your code in there.
[18:22:16] <wontoner> McFlanny: sibling?
[18:23:33] <limbera> it just complains about query wontoner
[18:25:07] <limbera> hah! i worked it out
[18:25:15] <limbera> had another on click handler returning false ....
[18:29:44] <MrFlanny> sorry guys, trying to do 4 things at once
[18:30:19] <MrFlanny> It's not just a sibling, the textare is the next textare to happen with that value after the input with "on tap" value
[18:30:30] <MrFlanny> but their are other dom objects before it and wrapping it
[19:14:43] <SeeThruHead> why does $.when(promise1, promise2, promise3).done() not wait for each promise to resolve
[19:15:22] <robertmaxrees> it does.  you might be doing something wrong.
[19:15:59] <SeeThruHead> the done function executes right away, but using .then it waits for all promises to resolve
[19:16:16] <robertmaxrees> how are you referencing the function
[19:16:36] <SeeThruHead> it's just an anon callback inside done
[19:17:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it should wait for all of them to finish.
[19:17:19] <SeeThruHead> i have a function that makes an ajax request, sets up a done handler and then returns the promise
[19:17:31] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code?
[19:17:59] <SeeThruHead> i will have to ask for it hold on
[19:18:16] <SeeThruHead> or make it in a fiddle
[19:18:20] <robertmaxrees> do a fiddle.
[19:18:26] <robertmaxrees> even if the ajax doesn't work.
[19:20:27] <SeeThruHead> is there something i can use in place of ajax to make a functional test promise
[19:20:48] <robertmaxrees> you can use a timeout that manually resolves the promise.
[19:21:23] <SeeThruHead> well i'm not using deferred
[19:21:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:21:49] <robertmaxrees> can you just show the code?
[19:21:56] <SeeThruHead> yeah one sec i have to write it
[19:22:27] <SeeThruHead> it's not my code i was helping someone so i don't have it, but i need to figure out why it wasn't working
[19:23:09] <robertmaxrees> if the code was written correctly, the .done() on the $.when() should only fire when all of the deferred objects are resolved.
[19:23:32] <SeeThruHead> yes well that isn't what was happening, so
[19:23:41] <SeeThruHead> need to figure out what our error was
[19:23:43] <SeeThruHead> one sec
[19:23:45] <robertmaxrees> so then the code is probably not written correctly :)
[19:24:08] <SeeThruHead> it was incredibly simple code though so i'm not sure why it would not work on done and work only on then
[19:24:24] <robertmaxrees> you might be passing references around incorrectly.
[19:25:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snv9xvg4/
[19:25:46] <robertmaxrees> for example.
[19:26:12] <SeeThruHead> ok but
[19:26:22] <SeeThruHead> a promise is not the same as a deferred is it?
[19:26:42] <SeeThruHead> the type of promise returned from $.get()
[19:26:44] <SeeThruHead> ?
[19:26:55] <robertmaxrees> $.get() returns a deferred.
[19:27:26] <SeeThruHead> heh too bad it didn't work then
[19:27:32] <robertmaxrees> then you'
[19:27:36] <robertmaxrees> *you're doing something wrong.
[19:28:07] <robertmaxrees> you should have done something like var myGet = $.get(); and then referenced the myGet var inside of the $.when()
[19:28:23] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR for more info.
[19:28:36] <SeeThruHead> yes
[19:28:38] <SeeThruHead> well
[19:28:38] <shoky> (technically $.get() returns a promise, not a deferred)
[19:28:43] <SeeThruHead> that's what i did
[19:28:45] <robertmaxrees> err, yeah sorry.
[19:28:47] <SeeThruHead> hold one sec
[19:29:31] <robertmaxrees> actually $.get() returns an object that has the promise interface technically.
[19:29:54] <robertmaxrees> but shoky is still more accurate.
[19:29:54] <shoky> yep, and usually that's called a promise. (an object implementing the promise interfacE)
[19:30:14] <SeeThruHead> http://jsfiddle.net/anhj7x74/
[19:30:29] <SeeThruHead> oops
[19:30:38] <SeeThruHead> need to return that promiseObject
[19:30:57] <SeeThruHead> http://jsfiddle.net/anhj7x74/1/
[19:31:31] <shoky> that "dataStore = data" can't be good
[19:32:06] <shoky> you want http://jsfiddle.net/anhj7x74/2/
[19:32:09] <SeeThruHead> i can't remember if that's how it was written
[19:32:25] <shoky> .then  transforms the resolved value,  .done doesn't
[19:32:58] <SeeThruHead> ok, but, setting the value to a global variable can be done inside done
[19:33:00] <shoky> er sry
[19:33:07] <SeeThruHead> without affecting the promise resolution
[19:33:09] <SeeThruHead> right
[19:33:20] <shoky> SeeThruHead http://jsfiddle.net/anhj7x74/3/
[19:34:07] <shoky> you don't need any global variable
[19:34:12] <robertmaxrees> SeeThruHead you're not returning the promise there.  you're returning the result of the .then() call.
[19:34:24] <SeeThruHead> i did not call then
[19:34:26] <SeeThruHead> in my version
[19:34:39] <robertmaxrees> then/done
[19:34:40] <robertmaxrees> either/or
[19:34:48] <SeeThruHead> the result of done is a promise?
[19:34:57] <SeeThruHead> don't promises always return promises
[19:35:01] <SeeThruHead> isn't that like the rule
[19:35:18] <SeeThruHead> you can chain multiple done calls
[19:35:26] <SeeThruHead> but not when using $.when
[19:35:49] <shoky> http://jsfiddle.net/anhj7x74/4/  this one even works
[19:35:50] <SeeThruHead> i tested on the code calling done on one two and three directly
[19:35:51] <SeeThruHead> that works
[19:35:58] <SeeThruHead> but not when inside when
[19:36:31] <SeeThruHead> that not really my question shoky but thanks
[19:37:08] <shoky> .done returns the original promise
[19:37:13] <shoky> .then returns a new promise
[19:37:33] <SeeThruHead> if i do .done().done()
[19:37:35] <SeeThruHead> that will work
[19:37:45] <shoky> a.done().done()  is same as  a.done()  a.done()
[19:37:52] <shoky> a.done();  a.done()   that is
[19:37:58] <SeeThruHead> but $.when(promise.done()).done() does not
[19:38:04] <SeeThruHead> is what my problem is
[19:38:21] <shoky> depends what "work" means..
[19:38:36] <SeeThruHead> it does not wait for all promises to resolve
[19:39:05] <shoky> donno what scenario you mean exactly
[19:39:15] <robertmaxrees> it does, just not the deferreds you're waiting for.
[19:39:33] <SeeThruHead> a.done(x); b.done(y); c.done(z); $.when( a, b, c).done(q)
[19:39:40] <SeeThruHead> q fires immediately
[19:40:15] <shoky> no, it does not
[19:40:23] <shoky> it fires when a, b, and c  have been resolved
[19:40:36] <shoky> (which has nothing to do with your .done(x) calls)
[19:40:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/snv9xvg4/1/ fwiw
[19:41:22] <SeeThruHead> well let's say q depends on global obects being set insde x, y and z, q will fail because those objects have not been defined
[19:41:24] <t4nk820> hi! when i click on select input i dont want to show child rows, is this possible ? here's my problem :  http://jsfiddle.net/whytheday/2Dj7Y/11/
[19:41:43] <shoky> SeeThruHead: right. because you're using .done instead of .then  and .done returns the ORIGINAL promise
[19:42:15] <SeeThruHead> i think that is starting to make sense, why is the original promise not resolved
[19:42:16] <shoky> so it will not wait for x,y,z   (though if they are synchronous i'd imagine it might work still)
[19:43:06] <shoky> but you should stop trying to set the global objects from the callbacks, and instead use the promises themselves as the values. (or, as ways to get at the values)
[19:43:27] <SeeThruHead> yeah i think that is the sane way of doing it but i want to understand why these things happen
[19:43:49] <SeeThruHead> you would think if $.when() is done then all the individual done callbacks will also fire
[19:44:01] <shoky> $.when just works with the promises you gave it
[19:44:05] <shoky> which are the originals.
[19:44:08] <SeeThruHead> but they do so async? and so cannot depend on one being called first
[19:44:10] <SeeThruHead> ?
[19:44:22] <shoky> hm?
[19:44:50] <SeeThruHead> if i set multiple .done() to one promise, i'm not gauranteed order of those done callback execution right
[19:45:11] <SeeThruHead> ah still that doesn't make sense to me
[19:48:21] <t4nk820> hi! when i click on select input i dont want to show child rows, is this possible ? here's my problem :  http://jsfiddle.net/whytheday/2Dj7Y/11/
[19:50:37] <shoky> for one promise i think you're guaruanteed of order, SeeThruHead. but adding $.when to the mix might be a different scenario. but anyways robertmaxrees's fiddle shows the $.when callback being fired last, as expected
[19:51:11] <SeeThruHead> i didn't really look because i do not understand deferreds
[19:53:45] <danskubr> does anyone have an idea how i can reproduce the "image" effect like in http://www.google.com/chrome/ that shoes the hobbit?
[19:57:46] <SeeThruHead> thank shoky and robertmaxrees i can't seem to replicate the issue in a fiddle, i will come back with real code, i'm sure it's something simple
[20:02:53] <pyCasso> anyone available to help with a small issue?
[20:03:07] <robertmaxrees> just ask
[20:03:20] <pyCasso> not sure how to return results from a function
[20:03:29] <robertmaxrees> by using the return keyword
[20:05:08] <t4nk820> hi! when i click on select input i dont want to show child rows, is this possible ? here's my problem :  http://jsfiddle.net/whytheday/2Dj7Y/11/
[20:05:47] <robertmaxrees> t4nk820 i don't see a select there.
[20:06:21] <t4nk820> <select name="" id="">                     <option value="">one</option>                 </select>
[20:06:39] <robertmaxrees> that's not in the fiddle as far as I can see.
[20:06:42] <t4nk820> ???
[20:07:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at your fiddle and I'm not seeing any selects anywhere.
[20:07:04] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle.
[20:07:04] <t4nk820> http://jsfiddle.net/2Dj7Y/1699/
[20:07:09] <t4nk820> sry!
[20:07:17] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/a6f90574ed5b
[20:07:34] <robertmaxrees> bind the selects "click" event and stopPropagation() on it, t4nk820
[20:07:38] <robertmaxrees> that'll probably fix it.
[20:07:49] <t4nk820> ok i ll try
[20:07:50] <pyCasso> im using return var-name but getting an error
[20:08:24] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso because userInputs is in a different scope.
[20:08:36] <robertmaxrees> what is this function trying to return?
[20:08:47] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want an array of input values?]

[20:11:51] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, Thanks for your response. When i click on a hyperlink I am calling this code
[20:11:52] <Guddu> $('.ui.fullscreen.modal').modal('show').height('70%');
[20:12:00] <Guddu> This shows the modal.
[20:12:18] <Guddu> Inside the modal I want to show the response of a http post. Is it possible to achieve that?
[20:12:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[20:12:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean an ajax post?
[20:13:19] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I am not sure. I am confused. Does it has to be a ajax post?
[20:13:44] <robertmaxrees> Guddu i guess i don't understand the question then.
[20:13:49] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, The http post that I will do will give me a pdf response. Ia m just not sure where to do what.
[20:13:57] <Guddu> I want to show that pdf in the modal
[20:14:05] <robertmaxrees> then you embed the PDF into the modal.
[20:14:12] <robertmaxrees> if you can even do that.  you probably can.
[20:14:39] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, TO get the pdf i need to pass a parameter to the server. To basicall construct the pdf file path. hence my need of doing a post.
[20:14:54] <robertmaxrees> how are you doing the post right now?
[20:15:25] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I can do the post by press of a button or hyperlink and it will return to me the pdf response. But I want to show it inside the modal.
[20:15:58] <robertmaxrees> right but will it be a normal form post, complete with page refresh, or are you doing it via ajax?
[20:16:24] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I don't want to refresh the page. I just want that the modal gets the pdf response.
[20:16:31] <robertmaxrees> then you need to use AJAX.
[20:16:48] <robertmaxrees> so get that part working.  then you'll need to replace to modal contents with an embedded PDF.
[20:16:51] <Guddu> Can it be done by normal post also? Such that only the modal gets refresjed but the main page remains constant?
[20:17:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[20:17:29] <robertmaxrees> if you don't want a page refresh, you have to use AJAX
[20:18:35] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, But how will i put the ajax call result into the modal?
[20:18:52] <robertmaxrees> in the .done() callback of the ajax call you'll have code that replaces the modal body.
[20:18:53] <pyCasso> robertmaxrees: can you take a look at this http://jsfiddle.net/43oLq1wo/1/
[20:19:34] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso that doesn't work either.
[20:19:39] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso just use $().map
[20:19:51] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, in complete you mean?
[20:20:15] <robertmaxrees> Guddu our you could construct the modal ahead of time and then replace just the relevant bits.
[20:20:29] <pyCasso> .map doesn't seem to work either http://jsfiddle.net/43oLq1wo/2/
[20:20:38] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use map.
[20:20:52] <robertmaxrees> did you read the docs I linked?
[20:22:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/43oLq1wo/3/ is what you want, pyCasso\
[20:23:31] <pyCasso> yes thats it. but not sure why .each() wouldn't work?? calling .get() seems extra
[20:24:29] <robertmaxrees> pyCasso .each() doesn't return the way you think it doe.
[20:24:31] <robertmaxrees> *does
[20:25:26] <pyCasso> and .join()...when i use .each() and console.log( userinputs ) it shows an array
[20:25:54] <pyCasso>  but im unable to return it or push the values into an object
[20:26:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:26:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't need a .join() here.
[20:32:04] <NitroLiq> Hi All, quick question. Anyone know the definitive answer with regards to minification and MIT licensing? Does the license have to exist in both src and dist (minified) files?
[20:32:15] <pyCasso> look at this example using .each() http://jsfiddle.net/43oLq1wo/4/
[20:37:16] <t4nk820> robertmaxrees i dont know why it doesnt work,can you help me ?  http://jsfiddle.net/2Dj7Y/1700/
[20:48:55] <t4nk820> i dont know why stoppropagation on select input doesnt work,can someone help me ?  http://jsfiddle.net/2Dj7Y/1700/
[20:51:21] <Guddu> robertmaxrees, I am able to post the form using ajax now but I am confused regarding how to update the modal div with the ajax response
[21:04:57] <Guddu> Please help
[21:18:30] <t4nk820> i dont know why stoppropagation on select input doesnt work,can someone help me ?  http://jsfiddle.net/2Dj7Y/1700/
[21:24:58] <Guddu> t4nk820, Why do you say its not working?
[21:25:38] <t4nk820> because when i click to select it opens child rows and i dont want Guddu
[21:26:13] <t4nk820> i want to avoid to open child rows
[21:27:10] <Guddu> ChildRow means the one that says Demo3?
[21:28:16] <t4nk820> yes!
[21:31:11] <Guddu> .hiddenRow  by no means is a child of name='resultatDashboardInput'
[21:31:16] <Guddu> t4nk820, ^
[21:31:57] <t4nk820> is that the right semantic?
[21:37:14] <jqueryius> hi, quick question
[21:37:15] <jqueryius> http://pastebin.com/rrHzLEga
[21:37:21] <jqueryius> I am trying to send post data
[21:37:31] <jqueryius> but on the other end, no post data is coming through
[21:37:37] <jqueryius> have I constructed that jquery incorrectly?
[21:41:00] <jakesy> it looks like it
[21:42:21] <jakesy> try $.post({ url: "/post/url", data: postDataBodyString })
[21:42:35] <jakesy> you dont seem to have a URL identified
[21:43:03] <Guddu> I am trying to show a pdf in a modal object. To get the pdf data I am doing a ajax post. The ajax post goes fine but how do i render the pdf inside the modal? Please help.
[21:44:00] <Guddu> I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token % in Javascript console
[21:44:01] <jakesy> Guddu: are you using <object data="/url/to/myDoc.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="100%"> ?
[21:44:32] <Guddu> jakesy, No. I don't get a URL to the PDF object. I get the PDF itself as ajax response
[21:44:41] <Guddu> The data shows up something like %PDF-1.5 in the first line
[21:45:22] <Dr-007> how do you find out what function is part of which  jquery plugin? im trying to find out what $('.something').collapse() is part of
[21:45:37] <jakesy> Guddu: looks like a complicated problem... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20466864/how-to-open-a-pdf-file-while-returning-the-file-in-ajax-request-success-response
[21:46:50] <Guddu> jakesy, I am doomed
[21:47:36] <jakesy> It doesn't look like it. Why are your PDF's coming back as ajax calls? are you constructing them on request or something?
[21:47:58] <jqueryius> jakesy - I have a URL
[21:48:06] <jqueryius> it's just that symfony uses path() to inject it
[21:48:20] <jqueryius> in fact, it's hitting the breakpoint on that URL
[21:48:23] <jqueryius> so I know that is working
[21:48:36] <jqueryius> it's just when I view post data (ie. contents of $_POST) nothing has gone through
[21:48:37] <__alangi__> hello
[21:48:45] <__alangi__> please i have a slight problem here
[21:48:53] <__alangi__> i want to know it this site is genuine
[21:49:07] <__alangi__> so please give me your own ideas about it.
[21:49:09] <__alangi__> http://onlineyouthjob.com/?user=71872
[21:49:15] <jakesy> jqueryius: what if your data is { form: { ui: task.getId() } }? sometimes things are strange
[21:49:35] <jqueryius> let me try
[21:50:01] <jqueryius> oh hang on
[21:50:08] <jqueryius> no, the task.getId() is GET data
[21:50:16] <jqueryius> thats working ok
[21:50:22] <jqueryius> it's the emailAddresses that is post data
[21:50:59] <Guddu> jakesy, Basically the server is reading a PDF file from disk and sending it back.
[21:52:08] <Guddu> jakesy, In the response header i have "Content-Type: application/pdf"
[21:52:17] <__alangi__> hello
[21:52:25] <__alangi__> is anyone not seeing my post
[21:52:26] <__alangi__> ?
[21:52:27] <jakesy> Guddu: I suggest using the ajax call to return the URL of the pdf, and then when you have that, to use an <object data="pdf" ...> tag to render it in a modal
[21:52:34] <Guddu> Can i use that response type to update the modal html?
[21:52:44] <jakesy> __alangi__, sorry but I can see you're already trolling in ##javascript
[21:52:56] <jqueryius> __alangi__ what is the website. it looks like a referral / spam link judging from the url
[21:52:56] <Guddu> jakesy, PDF is lying on the disk. Its not available through apache web server
[21:53:17] <__alangi__> jqueryius: thats what i want to hear
[21:53:33] <jqueryius> why
[21:53:33] <__alangi__> so please have a look at it and give me ideas please
[21:53:44] <__alangi__> jqueryius: because i thought of that too
[21:53:54] <jqueryius> how much money do you make per click
[21:54:26] <jakesy> however much your stolen facebook credentials end up generating :P
[21:55:19] <jakesy> Guddu: I'm not sure. All the stackoverflow results say you should host the pdf files on the webserver and serve them as static content
[21:56:29] <jqueryius> ah
[21:56:35] <jqueryius> post data needed to be second parameter
[21:56:38] <jqueryius> that was the problem
[21:57:22] <jqueryius> __alangi__ where have you gone
[21:57:33] <jqueryius> I thought you wanted to share the secrets of money making with us :(
[21:57:44] <__alangi__> i am here
[21:57:52] <__alangi__> any problem?
[21:57:57] <__alangi__> have you found something?
[21:58:00] <jqueryius> what is your angle
[21:58:04] <Uhkis> lol nice try
[21:58:16] <__alangi__> if you see it a secret, then no problem
[21:58:26] <jqueryius> wow
[21:58:28] <jakesy> he's already being dealt with in ##javascript
[21:58:37] <Uhkis> jqueryius: he's trying to get us to click on his reflink
[21:58:47] <jqueryius> it's so tempting
[21:58:55] <__alangi__> jakesy: i will take that as a complement
[21:59:00] <jqueryius> now that he said it's a "secret" I just want to click it more and more
[21:59:17] <Uhkis> :D
[21:59:21] <__alangi__> more over its not my link
[21:59:22] <jakesy> please don't, it's meant to be insulting.
[21:59:36] <__alangi__> but i want to find out some jerk brains in my country
[21:59:42] <jqueryius> __alangi__ just take a screenshot and put it on imgur
[21:59:46] <jqueryius> we'd be happy to have a look
[22:00:21] <__alangi__> jqueryius: screenshot of what?
[22:00:32] <jqueryius> of your referral link
[22:00:33] <jqueryius> sorry
[22:00:38] <jqueryius> your website that isn't even yours
[22:02:15] <__alangi__> jqueryius: i said its not mine
[22:02:36] <__alangi__> jqueryius: i thought web developers could help me detect something
[22:02:49] <__alangi__> but i can see they are so interested in them selves
[22:03:04] <__alangi__> continue with your self interest and don't focus on helping others
[22:03:10] <Uhkis> :DD
[22:03:27] <__alangi__> since you think everyone is thesame and you don't believe in what come real to you in life
[22:03:50] <__alangi__> i tabled my complain to JQuery developers but all they know how to do is give me bull sit
[22:03:54] <__alangi__> *shit
[22:04:46] <jakesy> I am truly sorry for your lots
[22:04:57] <__alangi__> jakesy: you don't need to be
[22:05:05] <jakesy> but it hurts. real bad
[22:05:17] <__alangi__> since you guys don't know who true hacker are, then you will find one someday
[22:05:24] <jqueryius> __alangi__ it's very simple. if what you are saying is legitimate, post a screenshot of the site on imgur
[22:05:32] <rcyr> Hack the planet!
[22:05:46] <jqueryius> but until then, it will be treated with suspiscion because it looks like a spam link
[22:05:56] <jakesy> I already read Mitnick's autobiography. He's the true l33t haxx0r
[22:05:58] <__alangi__> $(document).ready(function() {     MyBlah("Happy Coding with JQuery"); });  function MyBlah(JQuery) {     alert(JQuery); }
[22:10:52] <tvle83> I am using an svg image and need to manipulate the 'rect's and 'polygon's with css and jquery.. i am using this https://gist.github.com/tvl83/b426ab497d7ce90f3bff method that changes the <img> with the svg to inline svg so I can manipulate it.. it seems that there is some sort of problem with attaching the hover events i need because nothing happens when i hover
[22:12:38] <jqueryius> You know what. I liked __alangi__
[22:12:51] <jqueryius> He was a straight shooter, said exactly what was on his mind
[22:12:58] <jqueryius> We need more of that in todays society
[22:13:41] <tvle83> i need the inline stuff to finish before the hover()'s get called
[22:18:07] <Uhkis> jqueryius: but he lied about the reflink!
[22:18:44] <jqueryius> Uhkis: he was just trying to make an honest living
[22:19:05] <jqueryius> he could have been out stealing handbags or anything
[22:19:28] <jqueryius> :P
[22:19:55] <Uhkis> how is lying about a link honest?! :D
[22:22:48] <w1z> good evening fellow jQuery hackers ;)
[22:23:06] <Uhkis> morning
[22:24:00] <jqueryius> well, I guess I give him credit for setting himself a challenge.... I need help detecting "something".... the very suspiscious looking URL.... his weird story.... and he's trying this on people in a tech chatroom no less. The odds weren't in his favour, but he never gave up
[22:24:08] <jqueryius> And I think you have to respect him for that
[22:24:10] <jqueryius> ;)
[22:31:52] <w1z> hmmm
[23:18:29] <ismarkup> Good evening. I’m having a problem. Basically I’m trying to pass to a php script an object and a variable but I can’t seem to find a way to do it. here is my code, any help would be appreciated. thanks https://pastebin.mozilla.org/8823392
[23:20:01] <ismarkup> anyone around? :D
[23:20:26] <Uhkis> ?api serialize
[23:20:26] <b-ot> Uhkis: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[23:21:16] <Cork> Uhkis: he wants to send a file
[23:21:21] <Cork> so no serialize won't help
[23:21:27] <ismarkup> yeah :/
[23:21:30] <ismarkup> thanks tho
[23:22:03] <ismarkup> the file is sending great…no problem at all there…the problem is…uploadCategory has the directory name where the file should be placed...
[23:22:05] <Cork> ismarkup: do the same append you do for "file"
[23:22:15] <Cork> ans do it for "category" or something
[23:22:25] <Cork> everything else is right so :)
[23:22:29] <ismarkup> Cork: do you have any idea how?
[23:22:35] <Cork> i just told you
[23:22:39] <ismarkup> I’ve tried several ways
[23:22:48] <Cork> <Cork> ismarkup: do the same append you do for "file" <--
[23:23:26] <ismarkup> so something like form_data.append(‘category’,uploadCategory)?
[23:23:30] <Cork> yes
[23:23:58] <w1z> night.
[23:24:04] <ismarkup> Cork: the issue is..I don’t know where to put that…the code keeps stoping to work
[23:24:11] <ismarkup> should I add a new comma?
[23:24:23] <Cork> just add it on line after 'file'
[23:24:25] <ismarkup> should I add the new append before the comma? or after it?
[23:24:30] <Cork> no
[23:24:33] <Cork> neither
[23:24:42] <Cork> on==one
[23:25:54] <ismarkup> Cork: form_data.append(‘file’, file_data),form_data.append(‘category’, uploadCategory),
[23:25:57] <ismarkup> ?
[23:26:00] <Cork> no
[23:26:05] <Cork> its a separate command
[23:26:13] <ismarkup> lol I’ve been fighting with this syntax for hours lmao
[23:26:14] <Cork> so you separate it like you normally separate commands
[23:26:23] <Cork> ismarkup: its normal js syntax
[23:26:25] <Cork> nothing special
[23:27:05] <ismarkup> Cork: is it too much of a pain if you could illustrate it for me? :/
[23:27:17] <ismarkup> since I have no idea at all
[23:27:29] <ismarkup> thanks btw
[23:27:49] <Cork> you picked pastebin so responding means one has to copy it from there and
[23:27:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9trc0x70/
[23:28:01] <Cork> so, for future questions use jsfiddle
[23:28:31] <Cork> btw are you sure about  $(".categoryName option:selected").text();
[23:28:35] <Cork> that looks really weird
[23:29:03] <Cork> i suspect that what you want is $(".categoryName").val();
[23:29:08] <ismarkup> Cork: *shrug* I want to get what’s selected from the dropdown
[23:29:29] <Cork> ismarkup: your code gets the display value of what is selectoed
[23:29:32] <ismarkup> yes I was using that, but I want the text not the value
[23:29:32] <Cork> *elected
[23:29:42] <Cork> not the selected value
[23:29:49] <ismarkup> exactly
[23:29:57] <Cork> ismarkup: but... why??
[23:30:07] <Cork> that is really weird
[23:30:27] <Cork> why do you have option values you don't want server side?
[23:30:28] <ismarkup> it is to look for a directory name
[23:30:34] <Cork> why do you have them set at all then?
[23:31:23] <ismarkup> Cork: so I would be getting my variable as one normally do in php as $_POST[‘category’] right?
[23:31:29] <ismarkup> Cork: oh well, I really have no idea
[23:31:30] <ismarkup> hehe
[23:31:51] <Cork> what i meant is if you don't want a different display value from the storage value
[23:31:57] <ismarkup> I’ve been trying to build up for hours already…got lost like…4 hours ago lol
[23:31:58] <Uhkis> the value in $_POST would still be the value, not the text
[23:31:59] <Cork> just don't set <option value=""> at all
[23:32:29] <Cork> and the value will be the display value
[23:33:32] <ismarkup> why would I be getting the value instead of the name?
[23:33:50] <Cork> uh
[23:35:09] <Cork> ismarkup: http://jsfiddle.net/jam67o12/
[23:35:24] <t4nk820> ,can someone help me ? http://jsfiddle.net/2Dj7Y/1703/
[23:35:26] <Cork> if you have to go for .text() cause .val() is worng
[23:35:35] <Cork> then you have a very weird dropdown
[23:36:07] <ismarkup> Cork: lol I’m pretty sure I do
[23:36:11] <ismarkup> thanks a ton
[23:36:12] <ismarkup> btw
