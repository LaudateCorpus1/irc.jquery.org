[00:56:03] <aiena> I am using jquery 3 I am trying to uncheck an option button and disable it. CHecking is working but unchecking is not nor is disable again see https://jsfiddle.net/ug7qb7bq/8/ . What am I doing wrong ?
[01:03:44] <aiena> When you want to enable /disable an option button do you use "prop" or "attr"
[01:05:19] <aiena> hmm strange prop works correctly outside jsfiddle and inside jsfiddle it works wrongly
[01:14:23] <aiena> ok never mind found the bug
[01:20:17] <aiena> In Jquery how do I find out if one  option button is checked among all option buttons sharing one common "name" ?
[01:20:31] <aiena> o/ mfoxdogg|work
[01:20:46] <mfoxdogg|work> hi aiena
[01:21:25] <aiena> I need some help I want to check if an option button amongs all option buttons sharing a particular name is checked in jquery How do I do that ?
[01:21:41] <aiena> these option buttons will have different vals but common name
[01:23:10] <aiena> I have this code https://jsfiddle.net/ug7qb7bq/10/
[01:24:07] <mfoxdogg|work> https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[01:24:57] <aiena> if you select "person 2" with "person 1" selected the option selection jumps to option 2 I want this behaviour only if all option buttons are disabled. So if person 1 was selected first and made "project manager" then if a person selects option 2 it since "person 1 is active and proj manager is assigned as pm 1 I do not have to default to activatin the second selected person as project manager
[01:26:20] <aiena> hmm so I need to see if length = 1/0
[01:26:33] <aiena> thanks
[02:00:53] <aiena> Suppose I want to deselect all option buttons with a particular name if no checkboxes with another particular name are selected. How do I do that in jquert ?
[02:01:04] <aiena> *Jquery
[02:03:49] <sahbeewah> aiena: which part of it can you not do
[02:05:45] <aiena> sahbeewah, " if (0 === $('input[type="radio"][name="assignd_pm"]:checked').length) {} this should tell me if no checkboxes are selected now the second part I dont know how to do
[02:06:03] <aiena> erm sorry wrong code
[02:06:27] <aiena> * if (0 === $('input[type="checkbox"][name="assignd_emps[]"]:checked').length) { }
[02:06:55] <aiena> now I want to deselect all radio buttons with name="assignd_pm"
[02:07:12] <aiena> this part sahbeewah
[02:08:34] <sahbeewah> hmm.. something like… $(‘input[type="radio"][name="assignd_pm"]:checked’).prop(‘checked’, false);
[02:08:42] <sahbeewah> probably
[02:11:17] <aiena> yes that works thank you
[02:11:53] <sahbeewah> no problem!
[02:57:41] <FishPencil> How should I attempt to detect the OS for a machine?
[02:58:06] <Cork> FishPencil: you can't really
[02:58:27] <FishPencil> I don't need 100% reliability
[02:58:31] <Cork> you can get a hunch by using a database and map the ua to the different types
[02:58:36] <Cork> but it isn't reliable
[02:59:17] <FishPencil> there seem to be some popular libs that can help https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js
[02:59:18] <Cork> especially as some browsers use fake uas
[02:59:27] <Cork> it isn't enough to parse
[02:59:33] <Cork> you need to have a ua mapping
[02:59:35] <FishPencil> or maybe https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js/
[02:59:43] <Cork> cause quite a few uas don't have a platform entry in the ua
[03:00:44] <Cork> and also those that do usually have a content that doesn't mapp to "mac" or "windows"
[03:01:00] <FishPencil> what legitimate modern browsers spoof their UA
[03:01:11] <Cork> everyone with ublock installed for example
[03:01:24] <FishPencil> *has ublock installed*
[03:01:48] <Cork> or was it umatrix...
[03:02:13] <Cork> ya, its umatrix
[03:02:54] <FishPencil> this is the top google hit on the matter http://www.javascripter.net/faq/operatin.htm
[03:03:30] <Cork> finya, and that was somewhat ok before there was mobile phones
[03:03:39] <Cork> -fin
[03:04:03] <FishPencil> I know nothing is perfect, but what is my best shot here
[03:04:09] <Cork> it will fail horribly for mobiles
[03:04:13] <Cork> or tvs
[03:04:14] <Cork> or...
[03:20:35] <Junior> yello :)
[03:22:12] <Junior> i have two divs that i want to animate separately. with a single one it works as expected but when using the same function on two elements only the second one is animated. this is my code: https://pastebin.com/3RdbM9W0 what i am missing?
[03:24:33] <Junior> i have tried in the first pleace to use the same class on elements that use $.each with the same result
[03:25:25] <Cork> Junior: make a jsfiddle showing the problem
[03:25:40] <Cork> also why don't you just use position: sticky; ?
[03:28:08] <Junior> the divs are in a certain position on scren and i want to keep it that way but once the users gets pass them to show aprox 50% of them untill fading out
[03:31:08] <Junior> my only problem is that i don't understand why the scrolling event is attached to the last element only
[03:31:26] <Cork> it doesn't
[03:31:30] <Cork> so again, make a jsfiddle
[03:34:09] <Junior> few minuites
[03:41:06] <Junior> Cork -> https://jsfiddle.net/15xm8ar2/
[03:41:30] <Junior> the only animate that is have is on the second div
[03:42:39] <Cork> Junior: define your variables
[03:42:48] <Cork> all your variables are globals
[03:43:07] <Cork> well no
[03:43:10] <Cork> but element is
[03:43:46] <Cork> also you don't need to do $(this) in a plugin
[03:43:52] <Cork> this will already be a jquery objecty
[03:43:55] <Cork> -y
[03:44:34] <Junior> Cork, vars are declared inside the function
[03:44:34] <Cork> Junior: https://jsfiddle.net/15xm8ar2/1/
[03:44:40] <Cork> not for element
[03:44:47] <Cork> it is in /1/ though
[03:45:22] <Cork> also you might want to do this.each(function() {}) in the plugin so it can handle more then one element matched by the selector
[03:46:20] <Cork> Junior: https://jsfiddle.net/15xm8ar2/2/
[03:46:58] <Junior> Cork thanks, let me understand that yuu have changed
[03:47:26] <Junior> i have tried in the first place with each , but could not make it
[03:47:56] <Junior> this was the mistake? element = $(this); and you made it var element = this
[03:47:57] <Junior> fmm
[03:48:56] <Cork> well $(this) at the top level is unneeded as it is already a jquery object
[03:49:02] <Cork> but the mis was the missing var
[03:49:20] <Junior> var element...
[03:49:33] <Junior> it's inside the function so it's not global
[03:49:51] <Junior> i haven't defined the var in the anonymous jquery function
[03:50:02] <Cork> ya, so it is a global
[03:50:15] <Cork> newVariable = value === window.newVariable = value
[03:50:39] <Cork> var newVariable = value is only defined inside there and not accessable from outside it
[03:51:10] <Junior> sorry, brb 1 minute
[03:52:29] <Cork> Junior: https://jsfiddle.net/es3wd4ew/
[04:02:08] <Junior> Cork, much appreciated, js different from other languages, thank you for your time!
[04:02:30] <Cork> Junior: it is a common mistake
[04:02:43] <Cork> Junior: "use strict" is a way to get away from that though
[04:03:05] <Cork> Junior: https://jsfiddle.net/es3wd4ew/1/
[04:03:17] <Cork> and https://jsfiddle.net/es3wd4ew/2/
[04:05:40] <Junior> got it, thanks!
[04:05:48] <Cork> np
[04:11:18] <Junior> need to detect if element is visible in viewport now as i get animations for all my divs
[04:11:28] <Junior> even not visible ones and i don't want to slow down browsers
[04:11:56] <Cork> you will have to compare the elm.position() values
[04:14:21] <Junior> and compare with $(window).scrollTop() ?
[04:14:52] <Junior> $(window).top, sorry
[04:15:02] <Cork> scrollTop
[04:15:23] <Cork> window.scrollY to be precise
[04:17:06] <Junior> will see what i can do, thanks!
[04:57:56] <codecutter> anyone have an example that displays a div on hovering over some text, and disappears when the cursor is moved away from that text (unless the cursor as moved to the region over hovered div)?
[04:58:08] <codecutter> when hovering*
[05:01:40] <hellyeah> let us think about it
[05:05:52] <hellyeah> do you know .hover event?
[05:06:38] <codecutter> i'm using mouseover/mouseleave
[05:07:44] <hellyeah> or
[05:07:48] <hellyeah> .mouseenter
[05:08:09] <codecutter> mouseenter dosn;t seem to display the text for some reason
[05:08:39] <hellyeah> well you want to show a div
[05:08:45] <hellyeah> when you hover the text right
[05:09:13] <codecutter> i so far managed that part
[05:09:23] <hellyeah> hmm do you have fiddle?
[05:09:26] <hellyeah> jsfiddle
[05:09:41] <codecutter> 1 sec
[05:09:45] <hellyeah> sure
[05:20:45] <codecutter> hellyeah: strangely 'mouseenter' seems to work on jsfiddle, not sure why is fails on script https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/
[05:21:06] <hellyeah> what console says about that?
[05:21:13] <hellyeah> let me see
[05:21:22] <codecutter> anyway...
[05:22:02] <codecutter> i'm trying to make div that appears on over hover disappear unless the cursor is on the div, make sense?
[05:22:11] <hellyeah> well
[05:22:14] <hellyeah> yeah make sense
[05:22:21] <hellyeah> i will show you a simple thing
[05:22:23] <hellyeah> a sec
[05:22:47] <hellyeah> i dont know why foo is inside text
[05:23:02] <hellyeah> do you know .addClass and .removeClass method
[05:23:16] <Cork> codecutter: jsfiddle wrapps the code in onload by default
[05:23:30] <Cork> codecutter: make sure you wait for .ready before you run it in your page
[05:24:30] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/1/
[05:24:54] <Cork> and https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/2/
[05:27:02] <codecutter> Cork: your first fiddle doesn't show hovered text, not sure you're trying to demo
[05:27:19] <Cork> codecutter: /1/ show the problem you get in your own page
[05:27:23] <Cork> and /2/ is the fix
[05:28:07] <codecutter> 2 seems like just my fiddle, did you add anything?
[05:28:34] <codecutter> oh, the function on line 27
[05:30:35] <hellyeah> i dont know attachto method
[05:30:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:35:59] <codecutter> Cork: script has a slightly diff structure, 'mouseenter' fails but 'moueseover' works (109) https://pastebin.com/qt5j6dHn
[05:36:24] <codecutter> hellyeah: just shoe me how you do it in jquery
[05:36:28] <codecutter> show*
[05:36:44] <codecutter> attachto is a flight framework keyword
[05:37:49] <codecutter> i have line 85 because i had to use 'mouseover'
[05:39:09] <codecutter> https://github.com/flightjs/flight
[05:41:00] <codecutter> Cork: u there bruh?
[05:53:11] <codecutter> why does 'mouseenter' fail on this https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/3/ but works on https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/4/
[05:54:59] <Cork> codecutter: sorry, but what is the difference?
[05:55:21] <codecutter> i can't see any diff
[05:55:54] <codecutter> 1, is trimmed version of what you gave (1)
[05:56:00] <codecutter> 2 is mine
[05:56:27] <codecutter> no difference but one works other does not
[05:56:29] <Cork> hmm, that tells me this is most likely a timing problem
[05:57:36] <Cork> ah
[05:57:51] <Cork> /3/ is the one where i moved to code into head
[05:58:26] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/5/ moved back into onload
[05:59:07] <codecutter> what line did you add?
[05:59:18] <codecutter> looks the same to me
[05:59:19] <Cork> none
[05:59:24] <Cork> i changed the settings
[05:59:34] <Cork> (click the javascript gear icon)
[06:00:18] <codecutter> i see
[06:01:53] <codecutter> Cork:i'm trying to make div that appears, disappear unless the cursor is on the actual div
[06:02:10] <Cork> and why are you using flight?
[06:02:13] <codecutter> on 'mouseout'
[06:02:35] <codecutter> its a stupid mistake i made now i'm stuck with it
[06:02:45] <codecutter> the darn is no longer in development
[06:02:53] <codecutter> darn thing*
[06:02:55] <Cork> cause i suspect it is why you mouseleave doesn't work
[06:03:05] <Cork> and i don't know it enough to help you
[06:03:15] <codecutter> mouseleave works but mouseneter/out does not in flight
[06:03:33] <Cork> i could easily do it with normal jquery, but flight seams to do something with those events
[06:04:12] <codecutter> lets see jq, version and i'll translate it in flight
[06:04:23] <hellyeah> Cork:  use mouseenter, mouseleave event
[06:04:35] <hellyeah> ops
[06:04:37] <Cork> hellyeah: ya... i did and it doesn't work
[06:04:37] <hellyeah> sorry Cork
[06:04:55] <hellyeah> i meant codecutter
[06:05:22] <hellyeah> Cork knows better than me btw
[06:05:37] <codecutter> can i see a jsfiddle for jquery?
[06:05:48] <hellyeah> my net is so slow
[06:05:57] <hellyeah> let me show you what it is in my mind
[06:06:19] <codecutter> hellyeah, i was talking to cork
[06:06:47] <hellyeah> sure
[06:06:49] <hellyeah> i knopw
[06:09:26] <hellyeah> sorry for interrupting
[06:10:21] <codecutter> hellyeah: feel free to interupt
[06:10:25] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/6/
[06:11:17] <codecutter> Cork: i musy able to hover over the text that appears
[06:11:22] <codecutter> must*
[06:11:27] <Cork> ah
[06:11:44] <Cork> then you shouldn't use body as the holder of the element
[06:12:09] <codecutter> hellyeah: body was only for example
[06:12:16] <codecutter> Cork, *
[06:12:19] <Cork> and it makes the entire thing much simpler
[06:12:32] <codecutter> use '.foo'
[06:12:59] <hellyeah> hope it gelps
[06:13:04] <hellyeah> helps*
[06:13:13] <hellyeah> this is my idea https://jsfiddle.net/b8ervng3/
[06:13:17] <Cork> codecutter: https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/7/
[06:13:23] <codecutter> actually i append to body
[06:14:23] <Cork> ya, and if you do you will mouseleave when you move from the .test element to the .boo element
[06:14:39] <Cork> so append it as a child of the .test element and you can use the event structure to handle when you move into it
[06:15:10] <codecutter> ok, thx
[06:24:28] <IamTrying> http://i.imgur.com/rUZpAgI.png - Why VALID/TRUSTED certificated is showing INVALID certificate in Firefox, Safari, IE, IE Edge, Opera?
[06:27:11] <dimi1947> is there anyway using dev tools...I can see which jquery code attaches a class to an HTML element-the alternative of course would be to search through the codebase,I want something faster here though
[06:46:31] <hellyeah> check elements
[06:46:36] <hellyeah> will give you some idea
[06:46:45] <hellyeah> you add class after event right
[06:46:59] <hellyeah> you can  see all things in the correct element
[06:53:55] <Cork> dimi1947: the short answer is no, there is no trace on an element where some change came from
[06:54:03] <Cork> so you will have to know or search the code tree
[06:55:10] <Cork> IamTrying: not really on topic for this channel, but what issuer?
[06:55:50] <Cork> (i suggest you take the topic to #firefox as the other don't have a support channel)
[07:49:51] <IamTrying> Thank you Cork
[11:18:40] <hellyeah> hey why i cannot get the content when clicking buttons https://jsfiddle.net/93am0dkn/2/
[11:19:47] <taplar> don't do this: ($(this).attr('id')
[11:19:54] <taplar> use use: this.id
[11:20:04] <taplar> and what part has the issue?
[11:21:54] <hellyeah> no issue there
[11:21:59] <hellyeah> when you click items
[11:22:08] <taplar> no, that is an issue
[11:22:17] <hellyeah> you will get "blogdiv" opened
[11:22:20] <taplar> you are creating a jQuery element just for access to an attribute
[11:22:23] <taplar> which you can just .id it
[11:22:30] <taplar> you're adding un-necessary overhead
[11:22:38] <hellyeah> which line?
[11:22:47] <taplar> $(this).attr('id')
[11:23:34] <hellyeah> ah yeah if
[11:23:49] <hellyeah> but it is just for writing text to correct button
[11:23:57] <codecutter> div is not always removed on 'mouseleave' https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/8/
[11:24:20] <taplar> hellyeah: are you reading what i said about unnecessary overhead
[11:24:20] <hellyeah> but it is not necessary it seems
[11:24:40] <hellyeah> if is not necessary there you are right
[11:24:54] <codecutter> here is what Cork gave me ealier, i just translated to flight framework selectors
[11:24:57] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/7/
[11:25:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  okey i understand but
[11:25:21] <taplar> hellyeah:  and your toggle logic is working, if I inspect the markup it is putting the 'visible' class on the element
[11:25:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[11:25:31] <hellyeah> so
[11:25:42] <hellyeah> i see that but why i cannot see content
[11:25:57] <hellyeah> is it css issue?
[11:26:05] <taplar> yes
[11:26:05] <hellyeah> there is no error on console
[11:26:10] <hellyeah> damn
[11:27:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  any suggestion about that?
[11:27:52] <taplar> ##css
[11:28:14] <hellyeah> :)
[11:28:19] <codecutter> anyone?
[11:33:47] <codecutter> Cork: u there?
[11:33:53] <codecutter> taplar ?
[11:34:12] <taplar> i'm looking.  i'm not entirely sure what your desired result is though
[11:34:24] <Cork> codecutter: you want mouseenter not mouseover
[11:34:41] <Cork> mouseover will fire when you move from test to boo so it will add duplicates
[11:34:49] <codecutter> i can't mousenter to work at flight
[11:34:57] <codecutter> cant 'get*
[11:35:07] <Cork> they you will have to build your own mouseenter
[11:35:21] <codecutter> is that whats causing the issue?
[11:35:27] <Cork> check $(this).find(event.target).length
[11:35:34] <Cork> if it matches bailout
[11:35:38] <Cork> yes
[11:42:17] <codecutter> Cork: do you use a framework?
[11:43:24] <codecutter> i made a huge mistake picking the flight framework
[11:50:08] <codecutter> which frameworks do you guys use?
[11:51:53] <hellyeah> for what?
[11:52:33] <codecutter> dyamatic website
[11:52:37] <codecutter> dynamic*
[11:53:38] <codecutter> by dynamic i mean real time data
[11:54:04] <taplar> websocket sites?
[11:54:59] <taplar> personally i'd point you towards something like angular/react/vue that incorporates a data model layer
[11:55:24] <taplar> update the data model, the page gets updated
[11:55:49] <codecutter> i was considering react
[11:56:33] <codecutter> so you use a frameowork?
[11:56:44] <hellyeah> i closed all css but still  same
[11:56:46] <hellyeah> damn
[11:58:24] <taplar> most of my personal sites only use jquery.  i'm trying to switch to vue.  work usually mostly just jQuery pages, but we are using more angular now
[12:01:10] <codecutter> any particular reason, for vue instead of react?
[12:01:39] <taplar> i don't like reacts legal clauses.  probably would never affect me, but still
[12:06:13] <codecutter> one way to test is to look up the freenode rooms and count the number of people :)
[12:06:58] <codecutter> is it #vue or some other name?
[12:07:09] <codecutter> that room only has 3 users
[12:07:34] <taplar> vuejs probably
[12:07:56] <taplar> #vuejs
[12:08:11] <codecutter> thats better
[12:08:21] <codecutter> can you use jquery with vuejs?
[12:08:43] <taplar> sure
[12:08:58] <taplar> you can use jquery with anything.  it's just making sure it doesn't step on their logic
[12:09:54] <taplar> since react/angular/vue build the pages based on data, or can do that
[12:10:20] <taplar> any changes to that with jquery could potentially not mesh well or could be destroyed when the framework/library redraws
[12:10:37] <taplar> but using those libraries reduces the need for jquery
[12:11:31] <codecutter> most of my data comes from the server
[12:11:57] <taplar> and?
[12:13:09] <codecutter> ok, i suppose that is not a issue
[12:13:17] <codecutter> stupid question, to come to think of it
[12:13:24] <taplar> it's a change of mindset
[12:13:37] <taplar> those frameworks can be setup to build the page based off of the data model
[12:13:44] <taplar> so you are primarily changing/updating the data model
[12:13:48] <taplar> you don't care about the markup
[12:14:00] <taplar> there isn't "find elements to change"
[12:14:50] <codecutter> how would i accomplish this in vuejs? https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/8/
[12:15:13] <codecutter> actually i'll ask that in #vuejs, but feel free
[12:22:41] <taplar_lunch> from my experience, you'd put the events on the elements which would execute a method on the component that would manipulate the model in a way that would create/destroy/show/hide those other elements

[12:38:50] <codecutter> Cork: do you use vuejs?
[12:39:56] <cannap> i hope
[12:39:57] <cannap> P:
[12:40:14] <codecutter> me too
[12:40:20] <codecutter> lol
[12:40:56] <Cork> nope
[12:41:15] <codecutter> which one do you use, if any?
[12:41:21] <Cork> i don't :)
[12:41:28] <codecutter> shame
[12:42:05] <cannap> pure jquery two way binding
[12:42:36] <Cork> i prefer to have a page that works without js
[12:42:44] <Cork> so frameworks like that is a nostarter
[12:44:05] <codecutter> but when you have a large project, its can be alot of help
[12:44:26] <Cork> i have a large project
[12:44:41] <Cork> i still don't like sacrificing the user
[12:45:10] <codecutter> only, use is a jq?
[12:45:24] <taplar_lunch> jq is js, so that would seem to be a no
[12:45:33] <codecutter> lol
[12:45:38] <Cork> no i use js, but it is for enhancing the page
[12:45:59] <Cork> with js disabled you should get a basic usable page (not necessarily modifiable)
[12:49:00] <codecutter> well, i think i've decided
[12:49:04] <codecutter> going with vuejs
[12:49:16] <taplar_lunch> try them all man
[12:49:24] <taplar_lunch> see which you like better
[12:50:27] <taplar_lunch> just cause i've said vue a few times in this room doesn't mean it's the one for you, ;)
[13:00:19] <PCatinean> Hey guys, is there a library that simply just polls an url for data and prints it continously on a screen?
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> no need for a lib to do that when it's a few lines of code.
[13:00:42] <PCatinean> This is basically for a file.txt on a website that gets updated live and you gave to click refresh constantly to see the update
[13:01:01] <PCatinean> also maybe do some code highlight like a normal console would?
[13:01:05] <PCatinean> is possible
[13:01:07] <PCatinean> if*
[13:01:21] <robertmaxrees> that part would need a lib
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> but polling a url and printing stuff out on occasion?
[13:02:28] <PCatinean> nah on a certain location wher ethe script is set to run
[14:49:00] <arosen> Can anyone recommend or point me to a jquery library that implements a  slide to open menu similar to how gmail works on mobile to delete an item?
[15:28:16] <Sirisian|Work> I noticed by default when using jquery ui drag and drop that you can't drop into the draggable item's children they are droppable. Is there a simple solution to enable that? The draggable is using helper so its clone is what is moving around, yet it behaves like there's no helper.
[15:44:06] <Sirisian|Work> This shows the problem well: https://jsfiddle.net/5dhfmmxf/ There are 3 nested divs. You can drag each of them, and I want to drop onto any of them including itself; however, you can only drag children onto parents and can never drag parents onto children.
[15:45:38] <Sirisian|Work> I think this has to do with how jquery ui works when not using the helper. Usually you're dragging around the element so the idea of being able to drag it into one of its children doesn't make sense so they ignore all children droppables. When using the helper though that clones the object it makes sense that one might want to drag into a child.
[16:05:52] <Sirisian|Work> https://jsfiddle.net/5dhfmmxf/2/ fixed a minor bug in the example so that green can be dropped onto red.
[18:05:41] <crazycoder> hello
[18:06:14] <crazycoder> is it possible to show the suggestions (with JQUERY-UI autocomplete) always ?
[18:06:24] <crazycoder> always opened when the focus is on the input

[20:05:57] <vtx> hi guys, i have a ~5mb json file that i want to lazy load into a webpage. ideally, the json would be displayed in an expandable table that as you click the name of an object, the value is fetched from the json object in memory. can anyone recommend a library/solution to this?
