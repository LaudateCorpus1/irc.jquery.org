[09:11:02] <soup> download.jqueryui.com is down
[10:04:53] <Cork> soup: known, it has been down for weeks
[10:07:08] <Cork> soup: there is a third party clone of it linked from the issue about it https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/371
[10:07:26] <Cork> but i doubt it is going to come up again to be honest
[10:42:50] <soup> Cork, why so pessimistic?
[10:43:16] <soup> Cork, thank you for the mirror
[12:27:41] <eia1x> Hi! I am trying to run my jQuery code (https://pastebin.com/Mp7pj3Bn) to redirect the link in a div. It turns out that he accuses "TypeError: $ (...). Load is not a function" after the first time. Am I forgetting something to close the function?
[12:56:18] <andrew> hi
[14:08:33] <taplar> eia1x is that the exact error?
[14:08:49] <taplar> because the case of "Load" is suspect there
[14:18:33] * robertmaxrees plays the Jeopardy "Think" music
[14:22:36] <taplar> his response is failing to load as well
[15:08:22] <taplar> :|
