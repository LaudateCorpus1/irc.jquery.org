[09:32:25] <jak2000> hi all
[09:33:28] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/57sbqx8n/1/  how to type the cell name (a sample: E-6) find on the table and change the title? thanks
[10:04:45] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/57sbqx8n/2/  how to type the cell name (a sample: E-6) find on the table and change the title? thanks
[10:05:10] <jak2000> i used: $("#myTableMapaPT tr td").filter(   but this return me the row... not the specific cell...
[10:10:28] <Robdgreat> jak2000: because you're selecting the parent row
[10:10:46] <Robdgreat> that is, you're changing the color of the parent row after selecting the cell
[10:12:18] <jak2000> Robdgreat ye , how to change only specific cell?
[10:13:30] <Robdgreat> for starters, you should probably learn the basics of js
[10:14:04] <Robdgreat> the fact that you don't know what this code is doing at all is a problem
[10:18:43] <Robdgreat> jak2000: where did you get this code from?
[10:18:59] <Robdgreat> it's broken in a few different ways
[10:19:43] <jak2000> for this topic wich link recomend me read/learn?
[10:22:50] <Robdgreat> where did you get this code?
[10:23:57] <jak2000> jquery part, stackoverflow
[10:24:13] <jak2000> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6135665/jquery-find-table-row-containing-table-cell-containing-specific-text
[10:35:28] <jak2000> other sample:  http://jsfiddle.net/yeyene/wAxNu/    but color background all the row... :(
[10:35:47] <Robdgreat> because that's what it's telling it to do
[10:36:41] <Robdgreat> do you really not have the slightest idea what that code is doing?
[10:36:59] <jak2000> yes
[10:37:34] <Robdgreat> why are you doing js when you don't know how?
[10:37:58] <jak2000> try lookin the value '7' on first column (eq(0))
[10:38:00] <Robdgreat> I'm really trying to understand
[10:38:27] <Robdgreat> you mean '3'
[10:38:38] <Robdgreat> then what?
[10:39:40] <jak2000> in second sample
[10:39:48] <Robdgreat> I'm talking about the second sample, yeah
[10:39:50] <jak2000> ok 3 or 7
[10:40:05] <Robdgreat> where in the second sample does 7 even appear in the js?
[10:40:05] <jak2000> how to
[10:40:10] <jak2000> color only the first cell?
[10:40:15] <jak2000> not entire row?
[10:40:24] <Robdgreat> you tell me
[10:40:36] <Robdgreat> where is the color change happening?
[10:41:12] <Robdgreat> it's going to be much better if I help you understand and not just spoon feed you the answer
[10:41:34] <Robdgreat> it's an incredibly short piece of code. This won't be difficult
[10:43:14] <jak2000> yes i know why color enteire row..   $(this).css('background','red');   where this = a tr  $('table tr').
[10:43:21] <Robdgreat> great
[10:43:29] <jak2000> *entire
[10:43:40] <Robdgreat> and how is it locating the cell to check the text?
[10:43:43] <Robdgreat> the answer is right in there
[10:44:09] <jak2000> $(this).find('td').eq(0)   <--- here first column
[10:44:20] <Robdgreat> yes! :)
[10:44:29] <jak2000> ok:  $(this).find('td').eq(0).css('background','red');
[10:44:40] <jak2000> draw only specific cell   :) yupiii...
[10:44:40] <Robdgreat> try it :)
[10:44:47] <Robdgreat> see, and now you've learned
[10:44:52] <jak2000> now.....
[10:44:56] <Robdgreat> if I'd just given you the answer, you wouldn't have learned anything
[10:45:22] <jak2000> understand,  how to find in all table a value sample: 17   or John   andcolor specific cell?
[10:45:36] <jak2000> i think we need remove: eq(0) ?
[10:45:47] <Robdgreat> yes
[10:45:52] <Robdgreat> that's right
[10:45:58] <jak2000> not work: http://jsfiddle.net/my8703wh/
[10:47:10] <Robdgreat> I"m surprised it's not coloring the whole row
[10:47:12] <Robdgreat> hmm
[10:47:23] <Robdgreat> oh right
[10:47:30] <Robdgreat> no you can't just remove the eq(0)
[10:48:14] <jak2000> removed but not worked :(
[10:48:48] <jak2000> if($(this).find('td').text() == '17'){   <------ not find any value....
[10:49:58] <Robdgreat> thats' right
[10:50:06] <Robdgreat> I just said you can't just remove the eq(0) and expect it to work
[10:50:24] <Robdgreat> your filter method from the first one would be the way to go
[10:50:43] <Robdgreat> so let's revisit that and learn why it works
[10:53:27] <jak2000> is better do: for (xrow=0   { for xcol=0 {    and iterate in each cell?
[10:54:58] <Robdgreat> no
[10:55:06] <Robdgreat> are you reading what I'm saying?
[10:55:32] <jak2000> yes
[10:55:52] <Robdgreat> but you're still replying with other things like you're not reading what I'm saying
[10:56:08] <Robdgreat> your filter one can't have done anything because it's broken
[10:56:12] <Robdgreat> but that's the right way
[10:57:32] <Robdgreat> so look at that again
[10:58:12] <jak2000> ok reading and googlling
[10:58:21] <Robdgreat> you don't need to google yet
[10:58:37] <Robdgreat> it's almost there. let's go through it together
[10:58:48] <jak2000> this sample its too good: https://jsfiddle.net/57sbqx8n/1/
[10:59:04] <jak2000> here use contains.... and this sample yes.. search text in any cell..
[10:59:32] <Robdgreat> that doesn't have anything in the function
[10:59:44] <Robdgreat> but it does have the problem code
[10:59:53] <Robdgreat> what's happening in that js there?
[11:02:21] <jak2000> in the last fiddle? wih problem do you see?
[11:02:41] <jak2000> other thing, how to debug a fiddle? :) i now how to my own pages... but not fiddle  :(
[11:03:00] <Robdgreat> shouldn't be any different
[11:03:03] <mulch2> i'm adding elems to dom after page has loaded -- but the elems are being added to an iframe, not the main document... i can't seem to figure out how to bind to these new elems -- can anyone please help? :/
[11:03:06] <Robdgreat> you can put console.log in the code
[11:03:07] <mulch2> sorry for basic questions; dont mean to waste anybody's time. i have searched and searched; i just think the iframe is what's unique about this case, but idk.
[11:03:41] <Robdgreat> mulch2: would help if we could see some code. a test case on jsfiddle would be awesome
[11:04:07] <Robdgreat> jak2000: please answer my question
[11:04:58] <jak2000> <Robdgreat> what's happening in that js there?    <----- filter text not?
[11:05:11] <Robdgreat> the very last link you posted
[11:05:16] <Robdgreat> with the empty onclick
[11:08:04] <jak2000> ahh ok bad pasted (this is the final goal....)
[11:08:19] <jak2000> i am here: http://jsfiddle.net/my8703wh/1/
[11:08:27] <jak2000> try  solve, find 17 value
[11:08:59] <Robdgreat> that's not the filter one
[11:09:36] <jak2000> filter the '7' or the '3'  but only search on first column
[11:09:46] <Robdgreat> if you're looking in one particular column that one will work
[11:09:56] <Robdgreat> if you want to search all columns you want to use the filter
[11:09:58] <Robdgreat> so which is it?
[11:10:02] <jak2000> ok
[11:14:48] <jak2000> if($(this).filter('7')){    return true always
[11:17:49] <Robdgreat> I didn't suggest you do that
[11:21:09] <jak2000> Robdgreat: http://jsfiddle.net/my8703wh/8/  finally do the job with javascript...
[11:24:51] <Robdgreat> what am I even here for?
[11:25:04] <Robdgreat> I make a suggestion and you go and do something completely different
[11:25:15] <jak2000> i am work in 2 ways...
[11:25:26] <jak2000> continue work in first suggestion
[11:25:55] <Robdgreat> rather, I make a suggestion and you disappear for an hour and do something completely different
[11:26:24] <Robdgreat> you're not even using jquery here
[11:26:43] <Robdgreat> I asked a simple thing: look at the code you *already had* using filter
[11:26:58] <jak2000> yes i try use filter... but by moment all is true
[11:27:10] <Robdgreat> never did I say "this isn't going to work. try something entirely different"
[11:27:39] <Robdgreat> I'm done.
[11:27:58] <Robdgreat> this is pointless
[11:28:13] <Robdgreat> someone else can waste their time
[11:28:34] <jak2000> not waste
[11:28:48] <Robdgreat> mashing all the buttons until something different happens is not how you're supposed to program
[11:28:53] <jak2000> this suggested you: if($(this).filter('17')){   ?
[11:29:03] <Robdgreat> tell me where I said that
[11:29:08] <Robdgreat> (hint: I never said that)
[11:29:27] <Robdgreat> you're making things up and pretending I said to do it
[11:29:50] <Robdgreat> learn what .filter actually *does*
[11:30:00] <Robdgreat> learn to use the tools before you try to use them
[11:30:51] <jak2000> can you please explain this: "<Robdgreat> I asked a simple thing: look at the code you *already had* using filter"
[11:31:02] <Robdgreat> IN THE FIRST PLACE
[11:31:25] <Robdgreat> communication can't happen when you disappear for an hour between messages and then refuse to read anything I say
[11:31:40] <Robdgreat> I shouldn't have to explain this
[11:32:09] <jak2000> ok.
[11:33:03] <Robdgreat> I mean, can you understand why I'd be frustrated?
[11:33:51] <jak2000> yes. understand and escuse me
[11:34:06] <jak2000> and not wasted your time... i am learned some things....
[11:34:08] <Robdgreat> I really do want to help you, but you're making it nearly impossible
[11:34:18] <jak2000> but too need find solution to my case....
[11:34:30] <jak2000> no not impossible, can i continue?
[11:34:40] <jak2000> i solved by moment, and my client is happy, i can
[11:34:48] <jak2000> now center to jquery problem
[11:34:50] <jak2000> can you?
[11:35:01] <Robdgreat> remember the first example you posted?
[11:35:10] <Robdgreat> with the filter that you didn't know what it was doing
[11:35:19] <dimi1979> correct me if I am wrong...show errors fires even when there are no validation erros..I am referring to juery validate
[11:35:53] <Robdgreat> dimi1979: don't quote me, but that sounds reasonable
[11:36:41] <dimi1979> I thougt it fired only when there were validation errors
[11:37:06] <Robdgreat> I really don't know, but no one else is active right now who does
[11:37:27] <Robdgreat> what prompted the question? Something must have challenged that previous assumption
[11:37:30] <jak2000> we am here from this point: http://jsfiddle.net/my8703wh/10/
[11:37:55] <jak2000> where search the value... and colored the background but... only on first column
[11:38:01] <Robdgreat> that doesn't say filter
[11:38:13] <Robdgreat> the first one you posted was with filter
[11:38:30] <Robdgreat> I don't know how many times I'm going to have to say this
[11:38:42] <Robdgreat> I say you need filter, you show me the one that doesn't use filter
[11:38:44] <Robdgreat> why is this?
[11:38:58] <jak2000> looking the fiddle
[11:39:04] <Robdgreat> I guess I'm going to have to find it myself
[11:39:49] <Robdgreat> https://jsfiddle.net/57sbqx8n/2/ this one
[11:39:56] <Robdgreat> not any other one
[11:40:21] <Robdgreat> now you're going to disappear for an hour again
[11:40:48] <jak2000> nnot
[11:41:21] <jak2000> oo this is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/57sbqx8n/2/
[11:41:23] <jak2000> right?
[11:41:28] <Robdgreat> yes
[11:41:35] <Robdgreat> like I just pasted
[11:42:25] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/rs36mphL/
[11:42:32] <jak2000> same...
[11:43:07] <Robdgreat> finally
[11:43:29] <Robdgreat> ok, let's take this line by line
[11:43:47] <Robdgreat> do you know what the first line does?
[11:44:30] <jak2000> var search = $("#cell").val();   <--- value to search i get from a input
[11:44:41] <jak2000> here i typed: F-12
[11:44:43] <Robdgreat> that's not the first line
[11:44:53] <Robdgreat> the very first line of the js
[11:45:02] <Robdgreat> because there's no way that can work
[11:45:14] <jak2000> *F-2
[11:45:24] <Robdgreat> I don't care about the second line
[11:45:28] <Robdgreat> I asked about the first line
[11:45:38] <jak2000> understndooo yes
[11:45:45] <jak2000> $(document).on("click", "#btnTitle", function () {   changed the . by #
[11:45:54] <Robdgreat> yes!
[11:45:58] <Robdgreat> excellent
[11:46:16] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/rs36mphL/1/
[11:47:18] <jak2000> change all the row
[11:47:19] <jak2000> by moment
[11:47:50] <Robdgreat> it doesn't do anything for me
[11:48:42] <Robdgreat> oh I guess it does. It's hard to see because the cells have color applied
[11:49:05] <Robdgreat> can you tell me what .filter does?
[11:52:39] <jak2000> find the value and get the row number not?
[11:52:47] <Robdgreat> no
[11:53:10] <Robdgreat> it returns an array containing all the elements that the function inside returns true
[11:53:25] <Robdgreat> which is why you have to have a function, and not just "7" or whatever
[11:53:35] <Robdgreat> that's the part that actually works
[11:53:51] <Robdgreat> the text=="whateer it is"
[11:54:24] <jak2000> ok
[11:57:28] <jak2000> in the array exist a property named TD?
[11:57:40] <Robdgreat> but what you're doing is for some reason taking that cell and doing something to its parent row
[11:57:49] <Robdgreat> see that?
[11:58:00] <Robdgreat> the part after the filter
[11:58:01] <jak2000> yes
[11:58:03] <Robdgreat> line 5
[11:58:17] <Robdgreat> what should that be instead?
[11:58:52] <jak2000> }).parent('tR').css('background', 'yellow');   <---- this line color all row.. i understand
[11:59:02] <Robdgreat> ok good
[11:59:04] <jak2000> if i change tr by td not happening .... not color...
[11:59:05] <jak2000> right?
[11:59:24] <Robdgreat> if you change tr to td it won't do anything, because its parent isn't a td
[11:59:39] <Robdgreat> take the parent('tr') out
[12:00:27] <Robdgreat> since you aren't trying to do anything to the parent
[12:00:47] <jak2000> magic:  }).css('background', 'yellow');
[12:01:04] <jak2000> ok... we found the specific cell.. now...
[12:01:07] <Robdgreat> and it's coloring the right cell, isn't it
[12:01:07] <Robdgreat> good
[12:01:28] <jak2000> how to add title? to cell?
[12:01:41] <Robdgreat> how do you change the text of an element using jquery?
[12:02:15] <Robdgreat> do you want to change the text or the title attribute?
[12:03:11] <jak2000> title attribute
[12:03:26] <jak2000> some cells have 3 lines i add 1 more...
[12:03:47] <Robdgreat> wait, you want to add to what's already there?
[12:04:03] <Robdgreat> or replace it?
[12:05:23] <jak2000> add
[12:05:25] <jak2000> not replace
[12:06:22] <Robdgreat> ok, do you know how to set the title attr using jquery?
[12:07:42] <jak2000> only on a button
[12:08:02] <jak2000> $("#myElement").attr("title", "new title value")
[12:08:03] <Robdgreat> it's the same on any element
[12:08:08] <Robdgreat> yes
[12:08:46] <jak2000> or: $("#myElement").prop("title", "new title value")
[12:09:22] <jak2000> replace:  }).css('background', 'yellow');    by  }).prop("title", "new title value");
[12:09:47] <jak2000> yes... but this replace the title...
[12:09:52] <Robdgreat> that should change it yeah
[12:10:11] <jak2000> but how to add not replace
[12:11:12] <Robdgreat> I just found this because I wasn't certain
[12:11:18] <Robdgreat> .attr("title", function() { return $(this).attr("title") + "Appended text." });
[12:15:43] <jak2000> testing
[12:16:18] <jak2000> done....
[12:16:48] <jak2000> if need change the color background... need copy lines 3-5 and add the .css?
[12:17:20] <Robdgreat> no, just stick it on the end of the attr
[12:17:47] <Robdgreat> attr('title', "meh").css('color" "lol").text('hehe')
[12:18:22] <Robdgreat> jquery methods return the object so you can chain them that way
[12:18:22] <jak2000> ok, understand
[12:18:30] <jak2000> testing... on production code... wait a moment
[12:18:31] <jak2000> thanks
[12:18:36] <Robdgreat> you're welcome
[12:18:58] <Robdgreat> what's your native language?
[12:24:09] <jak2020> where are you from? .fr?
[12:24:39] <Robdgreat> me? us
[12:24:55] <Robdgreat> wait
[12:25:29] <Robdgreat> gets weird hiding nicks parts joins quits heh
[12:32:57] <Robdgreat> jak2000: did it work?
[13:12:21] <jak2000> disconnected...
[13:12:34] <jak2000> Robdgreat ahh us, east or west?
[14:24:45] <Robdgreat> south
[14:24:52] <Robdgreat> but I'm in NZ these days
[15:50:27] <jak2000> NZ is beautiful right? you are on vacation?
[16:48:41] <Enissay2> I am making a userscript for a website I use and was wondering if I can achieve this: I have a drop down list that allows one selection, when clicked/selected a new page is loaded. I'd like to intercept that call and append something like "?scope=all" to that URL and load it instead. Is that possible ? any clues about how to intercept ? (I am not fully new to userscripts but this scenario is new to
[16:48:43] <Enissay2> me)
[16:49:41] <robertmaxrees> why not modify the dropdown's links directly?
[16:49:58] <Enissay2> Gosh, I just thought of this and was about to check the DOM
[16:50:07] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you'd use .on() and try e.preventDefault();
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> depending on the type of dropdown, at least.
[16:51:41] <Enissay2> Aha, I see, i've use that last one before... But, you are right, updating the href is way easier, I'll proceed with that
[16:51:44] <Enissay2> Thank you buddy
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> sure.
