[01:05:29] <MACscr> what is the point in doing something like so? var stuff = $(html);
[01:05:39] <MACscr> i mean, why not just use the variable html as is?
[01:13:02] <Cork> MACscr: $() converts the string into a dom structure
[01:13:24] <Cork> MACscr: that means you can do modifications before it gets attached to the page
[01:13:33] <MACscr> ah
[01:13:54] <Cork> ex. add event listener or run a plugin on it (like ex. .autocomplete)
[01:14:39] <MACscr> btw, you have any advice for disabling inline onclick events while an element is within a particular div? I have buttons that are draggable/resizeable and i need to disable the onclick while they are in that mode.
[01:15:05] <Cork> you can reset the attribute on the element
[01:15:17] <Cork> but no, you can't control event attributes on elements
[01:15:35] <Cork> (and is one of the reasons i recommend not using them)
[01:16:06] <MACscr> i thought about just doing a str.replace('onclick','data-click') while its in there and then converting it back when its done
[01:18:00] <Cork> my recommendation is to add the event handler to a delegated parent
[01:18:08] <MACscr> crap, that would only help with the onclick and not the natural action of a button submitting a form. Hmm
[01:18:13] <Cork> and then check if the div you care about exists
[01:31:57] <MACscr> Cork any ideas why my type="button" on my button doesnt seem to stop the default action? Seems to disappear when you click on it too. Very odd http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/66/
[01:32:07] <MACscr> so click on Add Submit button, then try to resize it
[01:32:26] <MACscr> er, try to drag it
[01:34:22] <Cork> MACscr: most likely cause send_data replaces the html
[01:34:28] <Cork> can't say as that isn't included
[01:34:34] <MACscr> i do have it there
[01:34:42] <MACscr> send_data() is just blank
[01:35:27] <MACscr> its on line 7
[01:35:50] <MACscr> i guess i could return false
[01:36:16] <MACscr> no dice
[02:26:19] <MACscr> yep, i lost on what could be causing that behavior. very odd
[03:52:50] <paulretry> hello
[03:53:23] <paulretry> EasyUI textbox "\r\n"does not recognize a newline in Firefox,What should I do？？？
[03:56:13] <Cork> paulretry: some windows based servers expect text fields to send \r\n while the web spec is for \n
[03:57:16] <Cork> so either have the server check for \n instead or do a regex replace of "\r\n" => "\n" and then "\n" => "\r\n" and it should work with all os and browsers
[03:57:30] <Cork> hmm scratch the regex part :)
[03:58:20] <Cork> paulretry: if easyui is a js lib, check in it for a .split or something with "\r\n" in it
[03:58:35] <Cork> and replace that with \n and that would also work
[03:58:37] <paulretry> Cork:I replaced /r/n with /n and it didn't work
[03:58:38] <paulretry> ...
[03:58:53] <Cork> paulretry: ya, cause you need to replace it back to \r\n again
[03:59:06] <Cork> the first replace is to remove \r so you don't get \r\r\n if it already exists
[03:59:55] <Cork> the developer of the "EasyUI" (what ever that is) has only checked on a windows system, so it doesn't work on anything else
[04:04:00] <paulretry> Cork:i'll try it,thank you
[04:20:23] <Al_nz1> evening people
[04:21:44] <Al_nz1> what is the correct syntax to submit form data as JSON? http://pastebin.com/vmHNXhvg ?
[04:22:32] <Cork> Al_nz1: you have to generate the json data and give it to Data:
[04:22:40] <Cork> currently your giving it a param string
[04:22:48] <Cork> (serialize() generates param strings)
[04:23:06] <Cork> you could have a go with .serializeArray() it might be enough for you
[04:23:32] <Cork> there are plugin called serializeObject that might be what you're looking for
[04:24:02] <Cork> anyway what you need to do is data: JSON.stringify(<structure you get from serializeArray or serializeObject>)
[04:24:05] <Al_nz1> Hi Cork. I just wanted to return the form data as JSON
[04:24:21] <Cork> there is no such thing as form as json
[04:24:37] <Al_nz1> I said form data
[04:24:49] <Cork> forms doesn't have any given mapping between a form and json
[04:25:25] <Cork> for example what should happen if you get <input name="test1" value="1"><input name="test1" value="2">
[04:25:36] <Cork> params have a solution, json doesn't
[04:25:51] <Cork> (well more like params parsing server side has a solution)
[04:28:48] <Al_nz1> is this not the JSON encoded data: https://snag.gy/9M5Jaj.jpg ?
[04:30:41] <Cork> Al_nz1: make a jsfiddle if you want help in how to do this
[04:31:00] <Cork> images of the browser developer tools isn't going to help any
[04:33:33] <Al_nz1> Cork: you have steered me in the right direction. I should be able to get the rest from google
[04:33:34] <Al_nz1> thanks
[05:31:33] <MACscr> any ideas why my type="button" on my button doesnt seem to stop the default action? Seems to disappear when you click on it too. Very odd http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/66/. Click on Ad Submit Button, then try to drag it. It doesnt matter if my submit button has the inline onclick event or not either. I dont get it.
[05:31:58] <MACscr> for some reason it simply jumps positions to a negative value
[07:28:11] <dhecar> hello, how can I check if class has data-mode = passed variable? this is correct ? if (($('.order').attr('data-mode') = order.cid))  ??
[07:28:42] <Cork> that will check if the first matching .order has it
[07:29:40] <Cork> if($('.order').filter(function(elm) { $(elm).attr('data-mode') == order.cid }).length > 0) is a safe check if you have more then one matching
[07:30:07] <dhecar> aha
[07:30:13] <Cork> opps
[07:30:21] <Cork> $(elm) => $(this) the reset is correct
[07:30:23] <Deusdeorum> I am back with my thermometer, had to configure some stuffs. however, why the heck is my click function of that div#termo not working? https://jsfiddle.net/vaxuyqxL/12/
[07:30:56] <Cork> dhecar: so .filter(function() { return $(this).attr('data-mode') == order.cid })
[07:31:16] <dhecar> ok, i'll test it
[07:31:41] <taplar> Deusdeorum: div#termo doesn't have the data attribute on it
[07:32:01] <Deusdeorum> taplar so only using div works though..
[07:32:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vaxuyqxL/13/
[07:32:48] <Cork> or check for the attribute https://jsfiddle.net/vaxuyqxL/14/
[07:33:12] <Cork> Deusdeorum: also don't do $('div#id') just do $('#id')
[07:33:14] <Deusdeorum> Ah!!!!
[07:33:21] <Cork> no point in wasting the browsers time
[07:33:34] <Deusdeorum> Cork true, was messing around thinking that was the way to go..
[07:38:24] <Cork> Deusdeorum: also, just a little play https://jsfiddle.net/vaxuyqxL/16/
[07:38:28] <dhecar> Cork: Hi, if i want to append sub class in .order class where data-mode = order.cid?
[07:38:38] <Cork> allow you to drag along the ui ;)
[07:38:42] <dhecar> it's possible?
[07:38:49] <Cork> dhecar: sure
[07:39:15] <Cork> $('.order').filter(function() { return $(this).attr('data-mode') == order.cid }).addClass('sub-class')
[07:40:41] <dhecar> <div class="order" data-mode="c5"><div class="lines"></div></div>  I want to append class line where order.cid = data-mode.. i don't know if i explaini
[07:41:15] <Cork> you want to add the class or create an element inside it?
[07:41:27] <dhecar> well not create, excuse
[07:41:28] <Deusdeorum> really nice Cork
[07:41:29] <Cork> cause adding a class would create <div class="order lines">
[07:41:35] <dhecar> create
[07:41:48] <Cork> that would be quite a bit more complicated
[07:44:52] <Cork> dhecar: https://jsfiddle.net/31nznzua/
[07:44:58] <Cork> dhecar: but why do you need the extra element?
[07:45:44] <Cork> also note that solution will break if order contains text not wrapped in an element
[07:47:54] <dhecar> Cork: I'm triying to create kitcheen screen in odoo point of sale, I need that for each order the lines go to the correct order. http://pastebin.com/h3WUhgki
[07:48:33] <dhecar> orders are identified by its ID, line have as parent it's order with same ID
[07:48:57] <Cork> dhecar: hmm, a better choice might be to statically have the extra div in there then
[07:49:40] <Cork> cause dynamically injecting wrappers in structures is fragile
[07:50:15] <Cork> so make the order be <div class="order" data-mode="c5"><div>content</div></div>
[07:50:27] <Cork> and then you can just select the child div and set the class
[09:27:34] <robsco> if I call $(this).off('click'); does this also prevent the default click even, if it's an anchor tag, or does it just remove all the click events I put on the element?
[09:29:27] <taplar> it removes all click handlers bound to it with jquery
[09:41:38] <robsco> thank you
[09:55:28] <MassDebates> taplar - the form just made us a boatload of money on an order!
[09:55:41] <taplar> hmm?
[09:56:19] <MassDebates> remember how I was trying to come up with a way to work with PDFs for signatures and making several copies of them, dependent on the situation and context? (like if cust. wanted a print-out from his printer, etc)
[09:56:30] <taplar> oh yeah
[09:56:52] <MassDebates> It's been working out awesome and they signed an order. Now they want a more robust solution and NOW they can pay for it!
[09:57:08] <taplar> awesome
[09:58:38] <MassDebates> taplar:  Yeah. They're doing a portal thing with us now to cover services that go with the machine, like repair credit hr scheduling and warranty management.
[09:59:09] <MassDebates> taplar:  that's all good and dandy, but now that we're making that portal (it's beyond my abilities so I won't be doing it) I wanted to see if i can learn more of a proper way to handle that form
[09:59:23] <taplar> ah
[09:59:28] <taplar> brb
[10:00:36] <MassDebates> I was wondering if you can help me out in the future. No time constraints, really - they're using what they've got and the portal will carry stuff on. I'd like to make it a bit of a lesson for myself. I can handle the HTML and CSS and on-page Javascript, but I'm going to have trouble dealing with handling information afterwards in a more elegant ma
[10:00:36] <MassDebates> nner than before.
[10:00:55] <MassDebates> taplar_meeting: If not, no worries. If you miss this because of your meeting, I'll tell you again tomorrow or something :)
[10:16:06] <taplar> mmm, kinda vague.  i can offer my 2cents if you have questions.  no guarantee they'll be good ones.
[10:26:16] <MassDebates> taplar:  I wanted to do it over again, but this time follow the best-practices advice you and rob/duch gave me. I wanted to use it to learn, and I think i learned, but I want to try it again with what you guys suggested.
[10:26:35] <MassDebates> taplar:  I don't quite remember, though. I know what I did but I don't know what would've been the better way.
[10:28:51] <MassDebates> taplar:  Basically, I've got a PDF form that's darn-near unusable digitally on a tablet (at least for the sales people and their customers). I want them to be able to populate it on the tablet and then have the ability to save a record of the information, print it, or upload it to somewhere on the interwobz
[10:29:35] <jerit> is it possible to do an empty post with ajax? I mean a post where there's no data being posted to the form
[10:29:49] <taplar> jerit: sure
[10:30:15] <jerit> specifically I want to the page to execute a function on the server that will create a cookie which is used to hide a newsbox on the page so that the same user doesn't see the same news every time he visits the site
[10:30:38] <jerit> taplar: $.post("url", null, function () { // do stuff on success }); yes?
[10:30:48] <taplar> just don't give it the null or anything
[10:31:02] <jerit> so $.post("url", function () { });
[10:31:05] <taplar> yep
[10:31:39] <taplar> MassDebates: how are you generating the pdf currently?
[10:35:01] <jerit> taplar: I literally have no idea what I want this function to do
[10:35:17] <taplar> heh, you don't -have- to give it a method
[10:35:59] <jerit> ah I see
[10:36:13] <MassDebates> The PDF isn't generated lol
[10:36:15] <MassDebates> It's a PDF
[10:36:41] <MassDebates> Right now it's a web-page that collect the information and shoots it to where we want.
[10:37:02] <MassDebates> That's fine and all, but I want to do things the right way that you guys were pointing out before. I just don't remember what it is
[10:37:38] <taplar> ok, so one thought i had is there are some libraries available, or stackoverflow posts, about generating pdfs with javascript.  one possibility you could do is to make the form they fill out as a normal form, which can be made responsive for the tablet or other things, and then in the end the data used to generate a pdf to save/send where ever.
[10:38:27] <taplar> i don't remember much about our discussion.  just roberts hesitancy of clients letting you get on their network to do stuff
[10:52:44] <MassDebates> taplar:  Idk, Maybe the sales guys are super swindlers or something. They've been running fine and I've not heard any calls back until the portal thing
[10:53:47] <MassDebates> taplar:  I'm reseraching generation and whatnot. I want to see if I can fill an existing one in.
[10:53:51] <MassDebates> Probably not.
[12:20:02] <CandiiCain> 12:19 PM <CandiiCain> I'm currently in a adv markup and scripting class and I have to use Jquery so that when the user clicks the h3 tag, the p element directly below it must slide up. There's 3 h3 elements with 3 corresponding p elements below them. I can't use classes or ids. Any ideas?
[12:20:49] <Uhku> yes, read the course material and do the tasks yourself
[12:21:00] <CandiiCain> Gee thanks genius.
[12:21:22] <CandiiCain> There is no "material" we get links to w3schools
[12:21:31] <Uhku> oh god
[12:22:10] <CandiiCain> I have all the code laid out and most the Jquery, but I can't figure out how to get just the single p element to slide up
[12:22:38] <Uhku> Paste code @ http://jsfiddle.net
[12:23:00] <arunkumar413> Any one familiar with a* Search path finding algorithm
[12:23:13] <Uhku> probably $(this).closest('p') is what you're looking for
[12:25:16] <Uhku> or next('p') or find('p') or whatever depending on your markup
[12:26:59] <CandiiCain> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=lmazISRjFn
[12:49:28] <Al_nz1> How do I return a JSON object from form data - I have made a start here : http://pastebin.com/fMGTUMNa

[12:56:06] <qakhan> hi all, i am trying to filter datatable with date range. when i select date range i send POST request to PHP script and get all desire records. but i am unable to put these records in datatable.

[13:17:08] * taplar loves 2hr meetings
[13:24:51] <taplar> Al_nz1: you still have a question?
[13:25:38] <taplar> qakhan: datatables has method for adding new records to their tables
[13:26:10] <taplar> you'd have to check their dos
[13:26:16] <taplar> *docs
[13:27:55] <Al_nz1> hey taplar
[13:27:57] <Al_nz1> yes
[13:28:18] <Al_nz1> I replaced data : $("#formfv").serializeObject() to JSON.stringify(data : $("#formfv").serializeObject())
[13:28:35] <Al_nz1> but it still doesnt seem to return a valid JSON string
[13:28:48] <taplar> got an updated paste?
[13:29:29] <taplar> if you typed what you have verbatim the second one is invalid syntax
[13:29:47] <taplar> data: ... isn't a valid object.  you're missing the outer {}
[13:31:49] <Al_nz1> taplar: http://pastebin.com/yHWt89Gf
[13:32:14] <taplar> so line 11?
[13:32:40] <Al_nz1> ln11 should create the JSON object
[13:32:53] <taplar> data : $("#formfv").serialize()
[13:33:13] <\\\\\\\\\\\> Hello. I am having a strange issue, and my searches are turning up unrelated topics. It would appear that there is an upper limit on the number of event handlers I can have on page load. I am able to add new event handlers via the browser dev console however. I am lead to believe there is an upper limit because commenting out an older handler allows my new one to trigger. Is this the case?
[13:33:41] <taplar> not that i am aware of slash man
[13:34:04] <taplar> one of the handlers may be doing a preventDefault() which can cause the event not to be evaluated by other event handlers
[13:34:23] <Al_nz1> taplar: your saying take out JSON.Stringify
[13:34:40] <taplar> Al_nz1: $(formSelector).serialize() should get you what you need for data
[13:34:58] <Al_nz1> I need a valid JSON object?
[13:35:08] <taplar> data can take an object or a string
[13:35:24] <taplar> if you give it an object it converts it to a string for the ajax anyway
[13:36:28] <Al_nz1> taplar: I was trying to impliment : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-javascript-object-with-jquery
[13:36:55] <\\\\\\\\\\\> Strange. I only have preventDefault() in form submission handlers. Would those really interfere with this? Also, my handle's origin, for the curious: https://xkcd.com/1638/
[13:37:11] <taplar> sure you can convert the form to an object, but if you are just giving it to an ajax function there isn't really a need to do that, unless you have a specific reason to
[13:38:00] <taplar> heh, i was just saying slash man cause i'm to lazy to auto complete your nick, ;)
[13:38:13] <Al_nz1> taplar: well I want to get it into a format that a java library called Jackson will accept.
[13:38:50] <taplar> so your backend is expecting a json string then?
[13:39:04] <Al_nz1> yes
[13:39:12] <taplar> ah, ok
[13:39:41] <taplar> in that case you may have to do the serializeObject() and stringify it like you were, but you may also need to set the dataType on the request
[13:39:42] <Al_nz1> if I can get this to work : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-javascript-object-with-jquery I think it is what I want, right?
[13:39:51] <Al_nz1> yes
[13:40:16] <Al_nz1> ln10?
[13:40:19] <Al_nz1> sets data type?
[13:40:44] <taplar> try changing it to text
[13:41:39] <Al_nz1> jsonText ?
[13:41:54] <taplar> one sec, i'm playing with a fiddle
[13:43:45] <Al_nz1> like : http://jsfiddle.net/sxGtM/3/ ?
[13:50:34] <Al_nz1> I was missing a "," is one problem
[13:50:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/66mf7kr7/
[13:58:18] <Al_nz1> taplar: thanks - though that is quite different to the stack answer?
[13:58:36] <taplar> yeah, i was just trying to get some json to pass to the ajax
[13:59:03] <taplar> you can look at the ajax request in your dev tools network tab to see how the data is sent
[14:09:02] <Al_nz1> yeah. I will persist with the stack answer for a while to see if I can get it to go
[14:09:38] <Al_nz1> in dev tools/network - where in there do I see the JSON data in the post?
[14:10:03] <taplar> you can click on the request and it will open a side view with more info related to the request
[14:11:43] <Al_nz1> like : https://snag.gy/ytBbxO.jpg
[14:12:54] <taplar> that didn't load a picture for me
[14:13:08] <taplar> are you in firefox or chrome?
[14:14:35] <\\\\\\\\\\\> This doesn't seem to make any sense. I have set breakpoints on all of my e.preventDefault() calls, and none of them are caught. I am trying to set a elem.on('show.bs.modal', ...); handler, if that makes any difference. There still seems to be a limit on the number of handlers.
[14:15:07] <taplar> how many handlers do you have?
[14:16:30] <\\\\\\\\\\\> Less than 50.
[14:17:18] <\\\\\\\\\\\> A few are dynamic, but there are not any of those objects on the page I'm using to debug.
[14:18:20] <Al1_nz> taplar: chrome
[14:22:16] <taplar> \\\\\\\\\\\: https://jsfiddle.net/c781n1b3/  100 events
[14:24:09] <Al1_nz> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3rjaapNHpJJTDN4VjdiS1FBTEU/view?usp=sharing
[14:24:19] <Al1_nz> taplar: try that
[14:24:53] <taplar> Al1_nz: yeah so in chrome hit F12 to open the dev tools, click the network tab, optionally click the XHR filter inside it, then cause the ajax to send in the fiddle.  you should see the request and by clicking it more info should appear on the right hand side, one being header which if you scroll down will show you the form data
[14:25:33] <adamsilver> Can someone tell me why this is only working once: https://bpaste.net/show/fa397bd08060
[14:26:14] <taplar> put "" around your value in the first one
[14:26:32] <taplar> see if that changes anything
[14:27:00] <taplar> also if possible use a class instead.
[14:29:22] <adamsilver> taplar: adding quotes doesn't help
[14:29:43] <adamsilver> taplar: how would I say [id^=id_modal_] in class?
[14:29:55] <taplar> class="id_modal"
[14:30:08] <Al1_nz> taplar: thanks - at least I know what I am looking for now
[14:31:41] <Al1_nz> taplar: for me nothing appears in xhr when I hit submit
[14:31:52] <taplar> which fiddle?
[14:32:00] <taplar> because your fiddle you shared had no ajax in it
[14:34:40] <Al1_nz> taplar: this has ajax in it :http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/index1.html
[14:35:04] <Al1_nz> serialize object is at the bottom of : http://ec2-54-252-139-87.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/pol1310.js
[14:35:12] <Darmani> Hey guys, I have some coffeescript here and it's supposed to scroll to the bottom of the window whenever a user gets a chat message but it doesn't seem to be working.
[14:35:23] <Darmani> If someone spots any obvious mistakes let me know :)
[14:36:12] <taplar> yeah, don't see the xhr on that page, dunno.
[14:37:13] <Al1_nz> taplar: what should my url be set to ?
[14:37:20] <Al1_nz> in the ajax
[14:38:11] <taplar> oh, i dunno.  i didn't dig into the script on that page.  i got stuff in the office i have to do so I can't spend a lot of time digging around on a site.  fiddles are preferred.
[14:38:24] <Al1_nz> taplar: ok
[15:02:47] <Darmani> Just realized I never posted my code lmao

[15:03:34] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/55b12f9581fd0e6200e47d4f701cdf2a#file-chatroom-coffee-L30 <- The problem is this line here, it only seems to work once.
[15:03:56] <Darmani> It should scroll to the bottom of the chat window whenever there is a new message but it only works for the first one :[
[15:04:07] <taplar> i'm making an early escape today.  hopefully someone else can pipe in for you D
[15:04:17] <Al1_nz> u cant leave!
[15:04:29] <taplar> :D i'm hungry!  i skipped lunch!
[15:05:45] <Darmani> q.q
[15:07:08] <MikeD_> the use of foo.one(what, function(e){/* etc */}) is effectively the same as foo.on( what, function(e){ foo.off(what); /* etc. */ } )   - yes?
[15:07:38] <Darmani> wat
[15:08:10] <MikeD_> if you didn't know about .one() and instead implemented .on() and .off()
[15:08:47] <Darmani> I don't think I have any of those methods in the gist I just posted.
[15:09:17] <MikeD_> i wasn't talking about the gist you just posted, i was asking about my own tribulations with jquery and events  :)
[15:09:30] <Darmani> oh lol
[15:10:09] <MikeD_> now that I scroll back a bit, i see that you are having a problem with something happening only once and you don't want that... i have a problem with something happening many times and I only want once.
[15:10:37] <Darmani> Lol
[15:13:29] <MikeD_> so i looked at your code (can't seem to fix mine)
[15:13:45] <MikeD_> what do you expect to trigger the scrollTo again?
[15:14:32] <MikeD_> do you know you "received" a second time?
[15:15:01] <Darmani> MikeD_: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/55b12f9581fd0e6200e47d4f701cdf2a#file-chatroom-coffee-L10
[15:17:04] <MikeD_> ok, what about it?
[15:17:40] <Darmani> I'm sorry I actually meant to show you line 8
[15:18:03] <MikeD_> right, but what makes that event happen again?
[15:18:37] <MikeD_> do you have any console.log() you can see that new data has shown up but that the scrollTo() isn't happening?
[15:19:21] <MikeD_> it looks like you have two conditions before that line, i'm not familiar with coffee so i don't know how { } are managed on if()
[15:19:21] <Darmani> MikeD_: Hm that's a good idea. Let me check.
[15:20:14] <Darmani> MikeD_: Most code written in coffee doesn't require (), a function is basically ->
[15:20:29] <MikeD_> so where does your if() end after line 18 ?
[15:21:21] <Darmani> MikeD_: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/55b12f9581fd0e6200e47d4f701cdf2a#file-chatroom-coffee-L20
[15:21:29] <Darmani> It's the tabs.
[15:21:58] <MikeD_> load-bearing whitespace = omFg
[15:22:19] <MikeD_> kk though
[15:22:32] <Darmani> MikeD_: I didn't write this shit I just use it lmao
[15:22:50] <MikeD_> so did your test for received prove that you should have had a second scrollTo?
[15:23:24] <Darmani> MikeD_: yeah I do need another one.
[15:23:44] <SpecialTech> IS it only me, or is a ton of websites mad slow
[15:24:22] <MikeD_> yes, Amazon is having an event
[15:24:36] <MikeD_> http://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble
[15:24:45] <Darmani> yeah AWS has been down
[15:24:51] <Darmani> pretty big fuckup if you ask me.
[15:25:22] <MikeD_> internets are hard
[15:26:05] <Darmani> fucking hell it still doesn't work.
[15:27:34] <Al1_nz> on submission - what happens to the data generated by this code : http://pastebin.com/wUpwtqFF
[15:27:35] <Darmani> MikeD_: If you don't like coffeescript I'm guessing you don't like haml either lol
[15:27:44] <Al1_nz> I read it that the results from the serializeObject are passed into result?
[15:28:02] <MikeD_> never heard of haml  (other than Mark)
[15:28:16] <Darmani> ah
[15:28:26] <SpecialTech> Can't even work correctly cause AWS is done lol
[16:11:55] <MikeD_> how do i know if there are two of the same listener registered?
[16:13:25] <carcrash> hello, is there a function like load that can append external html files? the functionality of load seems to be to replace?
[16:19:38] <shoky> carcrash: nope you'd need to do it manually with $.ajax or $.get
[16:20:44] <shoky> e.g. $.get('url').then((html) => { $('#foo').append(html); })
[16:20:55] <Doxin> how does this not end up with images 1/3rd the height of the screen? https://paste.pound-python.org/show/XA7AcLT7k91gk5VZy64q/ I'm just at a loss as to what's going on here.
[16:23:10] <Doxin> as far as I can tell that math should /always/ end up setting the height to desired_height, but somehow it isn't, and no amount of debugging has informed me as to why
[16:39:32] <shoky> Doxin: prolly just a css issue.. https://jsfiddle.net/3cjs5hx7/16/
[16:39:51] <Doxin> shoky: turns out $(window).height() gives you the document height, not the viewport height
[16:42:09] <shoky> Doxin: it returns the viewport height i believe.. anyway i assumed you knew that desired_height is what you want..
[16:42:15] <shoky> as you've done so much debugging ;p
[16:42:56] <Doxin> shoky: well I didn't expect the documentation to lie to me
[16:43:03] <Doxin> using window.innerHeight instead works fine
[16:43:05] <shoky> Doxin: it doesn't
[16:43:16] <shoky> as you can see in my fiddle..
[16:43:23] <Doxin> well it's clearly not returning the viewport size, while the docs claim it does
[16:43:30] <Doxin> my screen isn't even 2660px tall.
[16:43:55] <shoky> cant say anything without seeing a testcase..
[18:56:52] <Mort432> hey all
[18:57:03] <Mort432> can anyone explain to me
[18:57:06] <Mort432> why this doens't work?
[18:57:06] <Mort432> https://jsfiddle.net/zqzd97sp/2/
[18:57:26] <Mort432> the intension is when the first select is changed, the second select will enable
[18:57:48] <Mort432> I've tried using attr, removeAttr, moving the location of the script, everything
[18:57:52] <Mort432> I just cannot get it working
[18:58:39] <Mort432> the event is definitely firing, you can see that clearly with an alert
[21:02:23] <MagnusVortex> \o
[21:25:33] <MagnusVortex> if I use $.getJSON, do I need to JSON.parse the result in the success function?
[23:25:51] <jak2000> hi all
[23:25:57] <jak2000> tapout?
