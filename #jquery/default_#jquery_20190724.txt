[09:00:06] <durga> hi
[09:01:41] <durga> hi is anyone here?
[11:08:00] <incog88> Anyone have a second to see if this looks right? $(window).on("product-variant-switch.product-details", function (event, data) { updateSpecs(data.variant.id); });
[11:08:17] <incog88> Seems like its not an event or a class its looking at
[11:08:30] <robertmaxrees> incog88 that might be a namespaced event
[11:08:38] <incog88> ahh
[11:08:47] <incog88> robertmaxrees, thanks
[11:08:52] <incog88> now i have to find that event
[11:08:54] <incog88> lol
[11:09:27] <robertmaxrees> you using shopify or something?
[11:13:45] <incog88> robertmaxrees, yeah trying to debug an issue
[11:13:56] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual issue?
[11:14:09] <incog88> for some reason a backorder message doesn't show up on load on Firefox 53
[11:14:18] <incog88> latest version it works
[11:14:41] <incog88> i see where the trigger for that event is happening but its deep in the theme js file
[11:14:48] <robertmaxrees> 53 was released in 2017...
[11:15:01] <incog88> yeah... tell that to the client
[11:15:05] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[11:16:26] <incog88> favorite part....the cloned theme is not fully functioning because of another shopify bug and now can't debug properly and have to use browser stack to do it lol
[11:16:39] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[11:16:53] <incog88> just started this new job too lol
[11:17:08] <robertmaxrees> blows my mind that people would waste resources on stuff like that.
[11:17:47] <incog88> Yeah exactly
[14:02:02] <codecutter> i need the setinterval to run immediately after the function is called?   setInterval(function () {//run }, interval)
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:03:52] <robertmaxrees> codecutter mind rephrasing that question?
[14:04:31] <codecutter> when setInterval is called with 2 min delay, then it waits 2 mins before it runs, right?
[14:04:43] <codecutter> i need it to run right away
[14:05:26] <robertmaxrees> so then call the function, then call the setInterval right after.
[14:05:48] <codecutter> yea
[14:05:57] <codecutter> :)
[14:06:08] <robertmaxrees> >.> so confused lol
[14:06:11] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[14:06:31] <codecutter> that was what i was about to do
[14:06:33] <robertmaxrees> also, depending on what you're doing within the interval, a recursive setTimeout call might make more sense.
[14:07:09] <codecutter> its polling the server for update
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're waiting 2 minutes at a time?
[14:09:19] <codecutter> no particular reason, other than to avoid overloading the server
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> heh, I'd implement that kind of protection within the server.
[14:11:01] <codecutter> how would guard against long polling without a timer?
[14:11:25] <robertmaxrees> you use timeouts.
[14:13:05] <codecutter> would server sent events would be a better option
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> without knowing more about what exactly you're building, it's hard to say.
[14:15:20] <codecutter> its querying the server for stock quotes, quotes are are always updated consistently by the third party api
[14:15:22] <codecutter> ...
[14:16:41] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, some kind of push setup would make much more sense.
[14:50:37] <Es0teric> where can i get a progress bar that has a total count and displays the progress of whats being processed?
[14:51:11] <Es0teric> well a good one
[14:53:21] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric "has a total count and displays the progress of what's being processed" - sounds like you have a pretty specific vision that might be too specific for a general plugin.  have you found something similar to what you want?
[14:53:50] <Es0teric> no
[14:54:19] <robertmaxrees> are you using bootstrap or anything like that?
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> i ask because there may be an available offering for that.
[14:58:59] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd suggest just building what you need instead of trying to find a singular plugin.
[16:41:39] <pape86> hello?
[16:43:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah i am
[16:46:29] <pape86> is there a way to do a drag and drop using jquery
[16:57:06] <Es0teric> pape86 yes
[16:57:12] <Es0teric> what kind of drag and drop are you trying to do?
[16:57:38] <pape86> Es0teric, do you know trello?
[21:56:38] <xeronate> is there a way to do something every time a new version of jquery gets loaded (say multiple references on a given page)?
