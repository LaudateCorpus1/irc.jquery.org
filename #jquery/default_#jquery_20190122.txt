[01:07:54] <quesker> oh looks like it uses selectors not xpath
[01:13:36] <quesker> got it I think    $('tbody > tr:nth-child(2)').remove();
[01:14:06] <quesker> they happened to be the 2nd row
[01:17:43] <quesker> oh that removes some second rows that aren't Text:    ugh
[11:09:21] <znf> Hi.
[11:09:59] <znf> How can I simply extract some text from multiple elements (an attribute value) and return it as a simple text array?
[11:10:52] <znf> ie: I need the outputs of - configForm.find('select').find('option[value="p"]').parent().each(function() { console.log($(this).attr('name').match(/domainfield\[\d\]/g)) }); to simply get pushed into an array, if that makes sense
[12:45:31] <Forbidd3n> Anyone here that can help me with drag/drop in contenteditable area? I have draggable items, but when I drop them into the contenteditable area it isn't inserted where my mouse is, no cursor, instead it just appends it to the end of the content in the editor. I think my issue is relevant to this - https://www.telerik.com/forums/drag-and-drop-in-combine-with-jquery-ui-draggable-and-droppable - any suggestions on how I
[12:45:31] <Forbidd3n>  can get this to work. Thank you
[12:45:53] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[12:47:28] <robertmaxrees> also: if you look at that response, it's pretty cut and dry.
[13:08:05] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: yeah, I know and understand why it isn't working. I am trying to find a work-around to get it to work
[13:14:57] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: here is a fiddle with what I have -- http://jsfiddle.net/blupointmedia/g3szd715/7/
[13:15:32] <robertmaxrees> seering a few hits in google for drag and drop in telerik editor.
[13:18:08] <Forbidd3n> yep, I saw them as well. Doesn't seem to work for me either.
[13:18:22] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[13:18:29] <robertmaxrees> i might hit up their forums at this point.
[13:24:53] <Forbidd3n> Hi robertmaxrees. My internet kicked out. Can you repeat what you were writing?
[13:25:17] <robertmaxrees> just "i might hit up their forums at this point."
[13:26:12] <Forbidd3n> I think it has something to do with the element being a block element. You can select anything in the browser and drag it to the content area and it will work. Confusing...
[13:27:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, dunno.
[14:43:36] <gambl0r3> hello?
[14:43:36] <gambl0r3> robertmaxrees, sup?
[15:04:08] <Forbidd3n> How would I get a hidden element and add an event to it?
[15:04:50] <Forbidd3n> I have elements inside of jquery accordion and I need to get all the elements with a class within this hidden element
[15:14:23] <robertmaxrees> you can select them like normal.
[15:23:24] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: when I try to do $('.myClass').length it says 0, but if I open the accordion item it then says the correct number of elements
[15:23:34] <robertmaxrees> can you show me?
[15:23:46] <Forbidd3n> one sec
[15:44:53] <spinningcat> can you suggest me good scheduler plugin?
[15:45:02] <robertmaxrees> "scheduler plugin"?
[15:45:04] <robertmaxrees> as in...?
[15:45:24] <spinningcat> yeah i guess
[15:45:43] <robertmaxrees> like what do you mean?
[15:46:19] <spinningcat> well calendar you can add event and you see events stick to that history
[15:46:24] <spinningcat> day i mean
[15:46:32] <robertmaxrees> so you want a calendar.
[15:46:49] <spinningcat> yeah t hat you can add event
[15:46:52] <robertmaxrees> you'll need more than jquery for something like that.
[15:47:09] <robertmaxrees> just share a google calendar and wash your hands of it :)
[15:49:03] <spinningcat> https://www.tripwiremagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jQuery-Calendar-and-Date-Picker-Plugins.jpg smt like that
[15:49:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that requires a backend.
[15:50:12] <spinningcat> or you can create object
[15:50:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:50:30] <robertmaxrees> you need a backend to store information in.
[15:50:51] <spinningcat> yeah actually
[16:58:15] <Toerkeium> please, I need help. I just build a really good web app, emulating google maps for searching hotels, with my customer web services hotel services, and I ask them for a feedback. It's really nice, a complex app, all they said is "I don't want to press scape to minimize the map".
[16:58:23] <Toerkeium> it's only my customers like that?
[16:58:31] <Toerkeium> "I don't want to press scape"?
[16:58:43] <Toerkeium> I need physological help
[16:58:49] <robertmaxrees> "scape"?  you mean "escape"?
[16:58:55] <Toerkeium> escape, yes
[16:59:03] <robertmaxrees> and is the map opening in a modal or something?
[16:59:10] <Toerkeium> no
[16:59:22] <robertmaxrees> heh, can you show us what's up
[16:59:22] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:59:32] <taplar> also, did they say what they'd like to do instead?
[17:00:05] <Toerkeium> I can't show it, it's on a user/pass based app
[17:00:13] <robertmaxrees> you can screenshot it tho :)
[17:00:47] <robertmaxrees> either way, depending on your users, I'll bet you just need to add a close button somewhere and you'll be fine.
[17:01:11] <taplar> probably need that anyway if some users could be mobile
[17:02:01] <Toerkeium> it wont worth showing as a screenshot, it does have lot of animations going from one place of the app to the other
[17:02:18] <taplar> heh
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium it IS worth a screenshot since otherwise we have no idea what you're talking about :)
[17:02:26] <taplar> ^^^
[17:02:27] <Toerkeium> yes, I think adding a "See prices" in a infowindow will end that
[17:02:29] <robertmaxrees> can't suggest UI/UX tweaks and improvements without seeing it.
[17:02:50] <Toerkeium> doesnt matter robertmaxrees
[17:02:50] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) giving us nothing to go on so it's next to impossible to really help.
[17:02:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:02:58] <robertmaxrees> you asked for help...
[17:03:09] <taplar> and can't show us code, or a screenshot
[17:03:16] <Toerkeium> just that.. I needed to share the "I don't want to press scape" experience
[17:03:36] <Toerkeium> I don't have anyone else cappable of understand that heh
[17:03:38] <robertmaxrees> so you were looking to complain?
[17:03:48] <Toerkeium> to share
[17:03:51] <taplar> that's a valid user feedback
[17:03:54] <Toerkeium> are your customers like that?
[17:03:55] <Toerkeium> yea
[17:03:56] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:04:01] <Toerkeium> I was thinking about that taplar
[17:04:06] <Toerkeium> I did something wrong if they tell me thaty
[17:04:15] <Toerkeium> realize just now
[17:04:32] <robertmaxrees> i mean, users on the sites I work with don't complain about that because i always give them a close button sooooo
[17:05:01] <Toerkeium> what's wrong with scape?
[17:05:12] <Toerkeium> it's handy, more than clicking on a button
[17:05:17] <robertmaxrees> *escape, and nothing is wrong with it.  but lots of users expect a button.
[17:05:29] <taplar> and, again, mobile
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> they may not know about the escape key on their keyboard, or otherwise use it very often.
[17:05:38] <robertmaxrees> ^ mobile is a very valid point, too.
[17:05:52] <Toerkeium> I see
[17:06:16] <taplar> also not everyone uses a keyboard.  some accessibility options don't use one
[17:06:28] <Toerkeium> you're right guys
[17:06:29] <robertmaxrees> ^ i'd also wager most users don't instinctually reach for the escape key like we would.
[17:08:30] <Toerkeium> you're so right
[17:08:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:08:45] <Toerkeium> ok, it was just shocking
[17:08:55] <Toerkeium> I'm going calm now :P
[17:08:57] <Toerkeium> heh
[17:09:09] <Toerkeium> realize it's my mistake, will fix it tonight
[17:09:25] <taplar> always assume your users don't know how to use your application.  it's up to you to make it apparent how to use it
[17:09:32] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^
[17:09:42] <Toerkeium> yeah
[17:10:04] <Toerkeium> it's just that I've put so much effort specificly on that, that having a "I don't want to press escape" as a feedback was shocking
[17:10:07] <Toerkeium> but you're right
[17:10:15] <Toerkeium> it's just my mistake, easy fix
[17:10:22] <taplar> you mean you put in effort to make the escape work?
[17:10:34] <Toerkeium> no, all the rest
[17:10:39] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[17:10:41] <Toerkeium> its interoperability
[17:10:54] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:10:56] <taplar> i'm confused then
[17:11:13] <taplar> if it's peanuts in the grand scheme of things, why be shocked?
[17:11:31] <robertmaxrees> Toerkeium how many major webapps have you launched?
[17:11:42] <Toerkeium> not much
[17:11:47] <Toerkeium> 4
[17:11:48] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:12:09] <Toerkeium> 3 related to tourism and one related to networking
[17:12:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah so.
[17:12:26] <robertmaxrees> end users will complain if you miss something obvious,.
[17:12:36] <Toerkeium> looks like :)
[17:12:38] <taplar> nah, they'll complain no matter what
[17:12:47] <taplar> can't make 100% happy
[17:12:50] <Toerkeium> tree too
[17:12:54] <Toerkeium> true
[17:13:01] <robertmaxrees> fair - to rephrase, you'll get the same, consistent complain if you miss something obvious.

[20:44:38] <Woet> rafuch0: the browser console just shows errors
[20:44:40] <Woet> rafuch0: use code like console.log to send information to the browser console.

[20:58:27] <rafuch0> Woet: https://pastebin.com/1iSuSKf1
[20:58:47] <Woet> dunno how "data" turned into "query" - but see above.
[20:59:27] <rafuch0> i changed that
[20:59:35] <rafuch0> to try make it work
[20:59:42] <Woet> [09:57:11]  <Woet>	rafuch0: yes, it will be submitting your form, which refreshes the page.

[21:05:46] <Woet> rafuch0: what do you think this does?
[21:05:52] <Woet> specifically method="post" action="comments.php"
[21:06:09] <rafuch0> no wayyy
[21:32:43] <rafuch0> Woet: it works now
