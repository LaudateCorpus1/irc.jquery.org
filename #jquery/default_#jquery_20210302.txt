[01:18:08] <jsleep> Hi jquery masters, I have a question hope you could help me - I'm not a web dev btw. This is my current code: https://jsfiddle.net/psck50mq/. Current flow is: Step 1: enter string `dev1`. Step 2: only rows with deviceid of `dev1` show, other got hidden. Step 3: Click the checkbox for all displayed rows. The problem: all rows are checked. My
[01:18:09] <jsleep> expectation: only displayed/searched rows are checked, hidden rows shouldn't be checked. You can remove the searched string too see that row `dev2` is also checked. Also, I am open to any pre-made table like those : https://datatables.net/extensions/fixedheader/examples/options/columnFiltering.html. But I cannot select rows with this one. Thanks.
[01:21:09] <jsleep> Another approach I can think of is, Step 1: display all datatable from back end. Step 2: do a normal search with POST request to backend. Step3: update the current full table to show only searched results. Step4: Checkbox all with those displayed/searched. But I don't know how to update current table with new POST data.
[01:21:36] <jsleep> Step 2 : could be GET request with parms, don't matter
[02:09:13] <robertmaxrees> jsleep sorry, whole wall of text.  so you want to be able to filter to rows that contain a particular string?
[02:09:34] <robertmaxrees> should only one column contain the text, or the whole row?
[02:10:23] <jsleep> robertmaxrees: just the column containing the text is enough. I wanted to search devices by deviceid. However, I just found this : https://www.gyrocode.com/projects/jquery-datatables-checkboxes/. Looks quite good for me.
[02:10:37] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[02:10:47] <robertmaxrees> still not clear on what you need, but glad you found a solution :)
[02:10:55] <jsleep> thanks :)
[06:15:55] <dimi1947> when an jax request fails...do you think I should inform the user(with a message for example)...or not informingg at all
[06:52:32] <Cork> dimi1947: that should depend on what the effect of the ajax call is more then if it is an ajax call or not
[06:55:19] <dimi1947> Cork:good comment...changes to the database
[06:56:09] <Cork> dimi1947: that isn't what matters
[06:56:36] <Cork> if it is an action taken by the user (the primary action) then yes the user needs to be told that the action didn't happen
[06:56:53] <Cork> if it is something happening unrelated to user actions, most likely no, it should not inform the user
[06:57:18] <Cork> ex if your pulling for comments in a notification list it shouldn't inform the user that it fails to update the list
[06:57:33] <Cork> while if you submit a message to the list it should
[06:57:42] <Cork> and "you" here is the user
[06:57:52] <dimi1947> I see...
[06:57:55] <dimi1947> I got it
[17:43:52] <xibalba> given this jsfiddle, how would i make it send a post instead of a get. https://jsfiddle.net/GRMule/WQXXT/
[17:44:40] <robertmaxrees> xibalba check out the docs at https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ :) just need to pass a method param and set it to 'post' :)
[17:45:13] <xibalba> thank you!
[17:48:33] <robertmaxrees> yep!
