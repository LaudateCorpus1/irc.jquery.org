[05:38:31] <Aquazi> hello, does anybody knows how to create dragbars like those in https://jsfiddle.net/ workspace?
[05:46:45] <Neo1> Hi
[05:46:59] <Neo1> I am thinking about create chat
[05:47:35] <Neo1> I need socket.io,, I want to install it now and test how does it work
[05:49:20] <Neo1> I want create chat?
[05:49:27] <Neo1> or casino
[05:49:55] <Neo1> want I need to use socket.io or jQuery?
[05:52:28] <hellyeah> what do you think?
[05:52:51] <hellyeah> do you think you need backend?
[05:53:06] <hellyeah> man jquuery is just for dom manipulation
[05:54:21] <undefined_bob> dont waste your time, hellyeah
[05:54:22] <Neo1> I think maybe need nodejs, but I dont know how to use it
[05:55:16] <hellyeah> nodejs is totally different thing
[05:55:23] <hellyeah> undefined_bob,  you are right
[05:55:33] <hellyeah> this question was really stupid
[05:55:37] <undefined_bob> did you work on the advices you got here yesterday, Neo1?
[05:55:55] <hellyeah> why did he get yesterday?
[05:55:59] <undefined_bob> if you dont know something you should read about it
[05:56:33] <hellyeah> come on man
[05:56:42] <hellyeah> chat app is really common app for nodejs
[05:56:52] <hellyeah> nodejs is for creating async environment
[05:57:03] <hellyeah> and chat is async
[05:57:12] <redCOAT_> hellyeah is there a channel for aspx microsoft
[05:57:24] <undefined_bob> he was mixing up stuff backend frontend languages and didnt listen to any advice
[05:57:27] <hellyeah> #asp.net
[05:57:40] <hellyeah> you can ask those question in c# as well
[05:57:51] <hellyeah> i am not so sure but i guess you can
[05:58:23] <hellyeah> undefined_bob,  either he is moron
[05:58:25] <redCOAT_> thanks
[05:58:30] <hellyeah> or his english is so fucked up
[06:00:31] <Neo1> hellyeah: I've installed nodejs now, will learn it
[06:00:40] <Aquazi> anybody could point me into a direction? <3
[06:01:08] <Neo1> hellyeah: I need now install maybe soket.it?
[06:01:16] <Neo1> hellyeah: do you know socket.io?
[06:04:30] <hellyeah> dude
[06:04:37] <hellyeah> RTFM
[06:04:43] <hellyeah> READ THE FUCKiNG MANUAL
[06:04:54] <hellyeah> they will tell you everything
[06:05:08] <hellyeah> first you need to install express to construct http server
[06:07:23] <Neo1> ok, I will
[08:41:21] <linurandy> I've a page that I'na load but I send a data like 1 with the function load and in the URL it push ?1 and I don't want de ?. How could I fix it?
[08:41:47] <Cork> linurandy: you mean you need to modify the path?
[08:42:12] <linurandy> just I want send this URL polls/2
[08:42:19] <Cork> then you want to modify the path
[08:42:20] <linurandy> not polls/?2
[08:42:43] <Cork> you would have to modify the url you give to the ajax function then
[08:42:51] <linurandy> how?
[08:42:57] <Cork> like url + 2 or url + '/' + 2
[08:43:17] <linurandy> with load function?
[08:43:22] <linurandy> with jquery
[08:43:31] <Cork> by load you mean $('#elm').load(url) right?
[08:43:40] <linurandy> yes
[08:43:44] <Cork> then ya
[08:43:59] <linurandy> $('#elm').load(url, 1)
[08:44:03] <Cork> no
[08:44:07] <Cork> you have to modify the url value
[08:44:21] <linurandy> ahh
[08:44:30] <linurandy> $('#elm').load(url+1)
[08:45:08] <linurandy> sorry $('#elm').load(url/1)
[08:45:37] <linurandy> Do you this right?
[08:45:54] <Cork> see my earlier response
[08:47:30] <linurandy> thanks
[08:53:27] <KnightsOfNi> How do you avoid an error message in the console when an api request returns a 500 or other error code? I have an error callback, but it still displays the red error
[08:53:42] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: you don't
[08:53:54] <KnightsOfNi> What? Why not?
[08:54:03] <Cork> cause you can't?
[08:54:16] <Cork> it is the developer tools detecting the network stack information
[08:54:21] <Cork> it is out of the page control
[08:54:22] <KnightsOfNi> isn't there a throw/catch thing in javascript?
[08:54:24] <Woet> don't return an error code if its not an error?
[08:54:35] <Cork> KnightsOfNi: it isn't asking the page
[08:55:07] <KnightsOfNi> well the api returns a 500 if it doesn't find the resource I am requesting
[08:55:26] <Cork> the consol/network tab is trusted code inside the browser it will list the network requests (in the network tab)
[08:55:44] <Cork> there is an option to show 5xx errors in the console; if that is true, it is shown in there
[08:55:46] <Cork> end of story
[08:55:59] <KnightsOfNi> could be that I turned that on
[08:56:03] <KnightsOfNi> is it off by default then?
[08:56:06] <Cork> it is on by default
[08:56:11] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[08:56:25] <KnightsOfNi> but it is not necessarily bad practice then?
[08:56:32] <KnightsOfNi> to have that error there if it's from an external source
[08:56:35] <Cork> no, it is perfectly normal
[08:56:42] <KnightsOfNi> ok
[08:56:43] <Cork> it isn't an exception it is a network error
[08:56:51] <Cork> completely different thing
[08:57:09] <Cork> (btw not found should be 404 not 500)
[09:41:52] <undefined_bob> Cork: are you in the mood to take a look at some css?
[09:42:40] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you want a question, just ask it don't ask to ask it just wastes ppls time (also if it is a pure css question it should prob be in #css)
[09:45:02] <undefined_bob> I know, I just didnt want to ask you css here before I asked you because its off topic here
[09:45:26] <undefined_bob> but people in #css tend not to answer if the question is a little bit more complex. and since you already know my code a little bit I wanted to ask you
[12:17:53] <taplar> why was the italian cook always scared?
[12:18:17] <taplar> he was al fredo
[12:18:30] * taplar wanders around
[14:07:46] <jQueryQs> Since I'm not auth, I can't ask this in ##javascript: would this be the correct way of being able to have a "max value" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1384074/limit-input-box-to-0-100
[14:09:49] <taplar> why not get authed?
[14:10:40] <jQueryQs> im on my phone so i just tried to come quickly
[14:11:05] <jQueryQs> figured it would be an easy answer :o
[14:11:29] <taplar> it's also OT
[14:13:02] <taplar> however I agree with the comments to the accepted answer that relying on type coersion like that is not a good thing
[14:13:36] <taplar> validate that it is a number, then parse it, and then do your range checking
[14:13:46] <taplar> or use the validate plugin like one of the answers suggests
[14:13:58] <jQueryQs> Thanks
[14:14:21] <jQueryQs> currently just using html5 to validate it's a number.
[14:14:42] <taplar> so it has type="number" on it?  or numeric, i forget which
[14:15:35] <jQueryQs> type=number
[14:15:47] <jQueryQs> and im switching the range to jquery
[14:16:00] <taplar> i could be wrong, but i believe that if a browser doesn't know what those are it will treat them as normal text fields
[14:16:25] <jQueryQs> you're not wrong, but the users that will use this, will be on newer browsers
[14:16:34] <taplar> k
[14:18:55] <taplar> then you just have to make sure it's not blank, and if it's not blank, parse it and check the range
[14:59:22] <jameshalpert101> Is there a way to fadeIn() to a certain opacity?
[14:59:28] <jameshalpert101> like fadeIn to say 0.8 instead of 1.0
[14:59:29] <jameshalpert101> ?
[14:59:50] <taplar> animate()
[15:00:11] <taplar> set the opacity to 0, animate() it to whatever you want
[15:00:35] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[15:04:51] <rokshis> Guys. How do I push single jquery elements into my own array and later just use the array as a normal jquery object? Code example: https://paste.ofcode.org/n4XfJM85jb4wEEaRmMem23
[15:05:21] <robertmaxrees> why not into a jquery object?
[15:05:22] <rokshis> remove does not seem to work. By the way its .remove() not remove
[15:05:45] <rokshis> robertmaxrees: thats what i wanna do. To convert that array to a normal jquery object
[15:05:50] <robertmaxrees> nono.
[15:05:52] <rokshis> But none of the jquery functions seem to work
[15:05:54] <robertmaxrees> just use a jquery object.
[15:06:05] <rokshis> Well, I need to loop like this.
[15:06:14] <rokshis> I can't just take all of them directly
[15:06:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:06:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:06:26] <robertmaxrees> what is partsArr ?
[15:06:58] <robertmaxrees> could you maybe make a fiddle with this?  i get the feeling what you want is a map of some kind.
[15:07:56] <rokshis> Just integers. Like 1,2,5,7,9
[15:08:09] <rokshis> so basically I need to find specific html elements, that have a specific number in their class.
[15:08:16] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're trying to grab every .g2_single_number_1 and put them into a jquery object.
[15:08:30] <rokshis> Say partsArr = [ 1,2,3,5,9]
[15:08:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:08:47] <rokshis> then I need .g2_single_number_1, .g2_single_number_2 and etc..
[15:08:58] <taplar> you could map the creation of the selectors, join the array with comma, find that at the end and remove()
[15:09:37] <taplar> would be less lookups too
[15:09:56] <rokshis> what u mean map the creation of selectors
[15:10:24] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[15:10:31] <rokshis> i know what is map..
[15:10:39] <rokshis> But I dont get the meaning the creation of selectors
[15:10:59] <robertmaxrees> your foreach is just selecting a bunch of elements using a dynamically created classname.
[15:11:35] <rokshis> Yes.
[15:11:42] <taplar> but 'selector1, selector2, selector3' works for selecting multiple things
[15:11:47] <rokshis> ohh.
[15:11:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:11:48] <rokshis> Now I got it
[15:13:01] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .add() to add elements to jquery objects.
[15:13:18] <robertmaxrees> but with the .map(), you sidestep the need for it in the first place.
[15:49:45] <rokshis> robertmaxrees, taplar thanks guys.
[16:35:49] <skinux> Which is currently the best modal plugin?
[16:36:22] <taplar> the one that does what you need it to do
[16:36:27] <da_wunder> ^
[16:36:46] <da_wunder> skinux: personally i have used bootbox.js
[16:36:59] <da_wunder> but then you need to use bootstrap, etc...
[16:37:26] <skinux> There is nothing that is just jquery?
[16:37:47] <taplar> jquery ui has dialogs
[16:37:54] <da_wunder> sure, jquery ui has those
[16:38:21] <da_wunder> skinux: https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[16:39:12] <skinux> Would that be appropriate for something that isn't ok,cancel?
[16:39:35] <da_wunder> why not ?
[16:39:51] <da_wunder> your dialog does "something"
[16:40:19] <taplar> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-message
[16:40:32] <taplar> there are various forms of the dialog if you go through the links on the right hand side
[16:40:39] <da_wunder> or https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form
[16:40:43] <taplar> which are all customizable
[16:41:08] <taplar> or just roll your own modal logic.  not that complicated
[17:54:57] <skinux> For Remodal plugin, can there be more than one modal of the same class name, using some other data to distinguish which one is displayed?
[17:55:35] <CrowX-> does $(document).on('click'      work on iphone?
[17:55:44] <CrowX-> or I have to use touchend?
[17:56:20] <taplar> depends on if the iphone browser emulates the click event
[17:56:53] <taplar> i'd suggest though looking into the touch events

[20:21:28] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/echfrdaw/2/ - where do I add minDate:0 to this?
[20:57:09] <Al_nz1> In the each function how would I also copy the class on each row? http://jsfiddle.net/s8F9V/706/
