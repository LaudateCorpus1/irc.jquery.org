[00:13:25] <elsevero> on masonry plugin how do I update the height of the container. since all the elements have the position absolute ?
[00:41:08] <serge> where are y'all listening to while coding?
[00:51:51] <h3yTh3re> hello there boys and gals, I got a tricky one, I have some json returning on an ajax success function and in there am checking if one of my arrays is null(which is for half of my cases) problem is when that is null it returns Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of null, the way am checking if its null is by if(array !== null){} i've tried
[00:51:51] <h3yTh3re> many other several ways which do not solve the problem any ideas?
[00:53:46] <h3yTh3re> its an object btw <:
[00:56:42] <christoph_> is it a good idea to save a dom element if i need it mulitple time or should i research it out of the dom tree
[01:50:08] <VanReyes> Afternoon everyone, need some help here. I'm using "autocomplete="off"" attribute for me to avoid suggestions from a textbox. I'm having an email page, before the email is sent. There is a confirmation and a button to go back to edit the textbox, but when I click back button. The input box value is all deleted and thats because of "autocomplete="off" so I need to type again. How can I remove
[01:50:08] <VanReyes> the autocomplete attribute after I click the back button? how what would be solution for this?
[01:51:01] <VanReyes> My idea is when I click the back button, I will remove the autocomplete attribute, but I find it hard because jquery can only traverse inside a dom
[02:10:48] <lessless> is it possible to call a .reduce() on the result of jquery selection?
[02:11:04] <lessless> Array.prototype.reduce(function(memo, node){ console.log($(node).text())}, $('.selector'), 0)
[02:15:38] <christoph_> hey, is it possible to customize your jquery-ui button icon ?
[02:16:36] <christoph_> of cause you can create your own icons or simply create an own icon class an define your special design
[02:16:37] <christoph_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3836241/how-do-i-add-a-custom-icon-to-a-standard-jquery-ui-theme
[02:17:21] <christoph_> but what i need is to create different colored icons (not predefined)
[02:20:06] <Jattenalle> christoph_, http://api.jqueryui.com/button/#option-icons
[02:20:34] <Jattenalle> just create a new class in CSS with your button, say, ui-christophs-fancy-icons
[02:21:19] <christoph_> jeah but predefine css classes isnt an option fr me
[02:21:29] <Jattenalle> why not?
[02:21:43] <christoph_> i need to paint the icon background in a custom way (the user defines the color)
[02:21:59] <christoph_> maybe adding css classes via jquery is an workaround
[02:22:10] <christoph_> but it would be nice if there is a better way
[02:22:21] <Jattenalle> or you could just write your own button theme-er
[02:24:20] <Jattenalle> something along the lines of: <button><img src="myfancything"> Click me!</button>
[02:25:12] <christoph_> jeah but i hoped there is already stuff :D but okay
[02:29:27] <Jattenalle> not if you want it to be dynamic and each button able to be different
[02:30:31] <christoph_> jeah i try to place a span inside the button, but there are some missformating
[02:31:03] <Jattenalle> you need to style your button class, so that it plays nice with your theme/stuff
[02:32:21] <christoph_> the problem is that we are using a lot of jquery custom theme and it will be hard to theme everything by hand
[03:30:32] <davetarmac1> Morning all
[03:31:38] <davetarmac1> I have an a with a couple spans within it, and need to mouseover on the a but when the mouse cursor hits the child span, the mouseover event stops - is there a way to include children of an element in the selector?
[03:31:47] <davetarmac1> (boy I hope I got the wording right!)
[03:34:23] <davetarmac1> mouseleave does the trick
[03:47:34] <donm2> hi can anyone help me with the following http://jsfiddle.net/3mar9zc8/ I've got a click function on #move and I'm trying to move the marker. The map is not shown once i execute teh click function.
[03:48:53] <donm2> ok don't worry just realised that I was sending the marker to off possition
[03:53:15] <Tennis> can i refer to an array and skip the first element?
[03:53:19] <Tennis> I dont want to remove it
[03:54:06] <Xoro> arrayName[x + 1]
[03:55:07] <Xoro> or if ( arrayName[0] ) { arrayName[1] }
[03:56:35] <Tennis> cheers xoro i will try those
[04:16:45] <spillere> does anyone knows a javascript "lightbox" that is similar to when you click on the picture here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/edurmoreira/17629583125/
[04:30:51] <Tennis> hey Xoro I couldn't make it work in this context
[04:30:58] <Tennis> and i could remove the first element and add it back
[04:31:10] <Tennis> just wondering if theres anyway within this function to skip the first element
[04:31:11] <Tennis> $.each(sarray, function( i, l ){
[04:32:55] <Jattenalle> Tennis, $.each(sarray, function( i, l ){ (if(typeof sarray[i+1]!='undefined'){ /* do something on sarray[i+1] */ }}
[04:33:01] <Jattenalle> like Xoro said
[04:40:21] <Tennis> I tried [i+1] to no avail
[04:40:30] <Tennis> but i didn't do if(typeof
[04:40:46] <Tennis> I did erm if (i = 0){}
[04:46:22] <Jattenalle> Tennis, yeah you can do that too, if(i>0){ do stuff }
[04:46:26] <Xoro> if (i = 0){} is invalid because i = 0 is a declaration. You mean ===?
[04:46:43] <Tennis> yeah i just came from the same stack overflow page
[04:46:51] <Jattenalle> you probably dont want to check if i IS 0, you want to check that it's more than (as in not the first entry)
[04:47:08] <Tennis> have yeah single equals sets , right
[04:47:50] <Tennis> its so messy what im doing but it works
[04:48:00] <Tennis> i store the page load values in a hidden div
[04:48:10] <Tennis> so i can reset a given div on reset
[04:48:42] <Tennis> but I'm using ajax to update so i have to update the hidden div at the same time so that the reset button continues to function as it should after an update
[05:02:13] <Tennis> if i > 0 , seems to be getting it stuck on a loop
[05:02:40] <stephen> Hah
[05:02:54] <stephen> Are you trying to pull an ajax request from localhost?
[05:02:54] <Tennis> nope my bad
[05:03:06] <Tennis> nope
[05:03:11] <stephen> because that specific call will return a status of 0
[05:03:14] <stephen> ok, good
[05:13:41] <toomus> HI. How to clear form text field after submit? Why this code clear field before submit? $('body').on('submit', 'form#chat_message', function () {     $('input#message_content').val(''); });
[05:18:12] <stephen> $('body').on('submit', 'form#chat_message', function () {     setTimeout(function(){$('form#chat_message').reset();}); });
[05:18:22] <stephen> $('body').on('submit', 'form#chat_message', function () {     setTimeout(function(){$('form#chat_message').reset();}, 100); });
[05:18:26] <stephen> sorrt
[05:19:04] <stephen> That will clear the entire form
[05:19:14] <stephen> Though reset() works on individual fields as well
[05:20:45] <toomus> stephen: I know, I can do something like on ajax:complete, but I want to clear field before ajax request, because this of course take some time to complete.
[05:21:33] <toomus> stephen: 100ms isn't so much, but is this the only way?
[05:23:16] <stephen> You want to clear it before the ajax post? No problem
[05:23:25] <stephen> You using jquery?
[05:23:53] <stephen> lol
[05:24:17] <stephen> var formData = $("#formid").serialize();
[05:24:26] <toomus> oh sorry, just after ajax request, but before ajax complete
[05:24:39] <stephen> still
[05:24:51] <stephen> grab the data using serialize
[05:25:00] <toomus> stephen: my first code clear field before request xD
[05:25:15] <stephen> There you go
[05:25:22] <toomus> stephen: So it sends empty message in params
[05:26:09] <stephen> If you're trying to send the data, send it using the data you got from serialize()
[05:26:58] <toomus> stephen: ok
[05:27:09] <stephen> toomus, maybe you should post your code on jsfiddle or something, so I can take a look
[05:27:33] <stephen> It sounds like you are trying to do everything inside the callback in the ajax function, which is a mistake
[05:27:39] <toomus> stephen: if you know Ruby on Rails :)
[05:27:50] <stephen> :-/
[05:27:55] <stephen> We're talking javascript here
[05:28:14] <stephen> I don't know ruby, I just mean the JS Ajax call and the form
[05:29:31] <toomus> stephen: wait a sec, I will show you
[05:31:17] <toomus> stephen: this is how you generate forms in RoR http://pastie.org/10188495
[05:31:55] <toomus> stephen: remote: true make this form submit with ajax automatically
[05:32:47] <toomus> stephen: so you don't have to make this with jQuery
[05:37:13] <toomus> stephen: so I don't have any $.ajax({...}); for this form
[05:56:52] <sadtaco> Erm. Is there a javascript obfuscator out there that is one way and not decodable back?..  Like I don't get why they don't just make var and function names illegible instead of doing crazy things that can be reversed fine.
[05:58:21] <sadtaco> ah yui compressor looks alright.
[06:13:17] <VectorX> hi, anyone know where i can find an example of a effect similar to how the score board gets shows for the first time on this page, http://espn.go.com/ like a trickle down
[06:19:14] <dimi1947> I have two  p tags with class="fill_mon" and class="fill_tue"...how I can target both of them by using the only the first word before the underscore...fill
[06:20:13] <notchris> dimi1947: $(‘[class*=“fill”]’)
[06:20:43] <notchris> dimi1947: See: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/
[06:20:47] <dimi1947> I do not understand some of the characters you typed....
[06:21:03] <Tennis> hey VectorX check out http://sorgalla.com/jcarousel/examples/basic/
[06:21:24] <notchris> dimi1947: Read the documentation link I referenced. That is an “attribute contains” selector
[06:21:31] <Tennis> I was looking it the other day the examples are like image slideshows but im sure you could use div elements filled with content and apply the carousel to it
[06:21:32] <dimi1947> yes notchris this seems to be the solution
[06:21:41] <notchris> dimi1947: The asterisck after the attribute declares a partial match
[06:22:01] <notchris> asterisk*
[06:26:57] <VectorX> Tennis im not seeing the connection, not looking for the scrolling just how all the items come down one by one
[06:27:45] <cordovafan8> Hi, I am experiencing a weird slowdown in ajax queries. If I time the script which is called by the ajax, it takes less than a second. However I don't hit the success function of the ajax call until several seconds later
[06:28:08] <cordovafan8> This is on both synchronous and asynchronous queries
[06:29:53] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: Only thing I can suggest is looking in the network pane and seeing what's going on.
[06:30:01] <notchris> VectorX: How there is a slight delay in the items sliding in?
[06:30:13] <VectorX> notchris yes
[06:30:18] <notchris> VectorX: You can use the animate.css plugin for this, it has a built in delay and will run faster than jquery / js could
[06:30:27] <notchris> VectorX: not plugin, library
[06:30:40] <Tennis> ah i get you its probably just a sequenced animation
[06:30:45] <notchris> VectorX: https://github.com/daneden/animate.css
[06:31:02] <notchris> VectorX: Then, use something like: -vendor-animation-duration: 3s;
[06:31:03] <VectorX> who are you ?
[06:31:34] <notchris> VectorX: And then,  -vendor-animation-delay: 2s
[06:31:35] <logikos> if i'm using javascript to do a document.write('<script src="/some/script.js" ...');  ... will a jQuery(document).ready() wait for that script to be loaded and usable before executing the code inside the ready function ?
[06:31:38] <Tennis> not chris thats for certain
[06:31:40] <logikos> or is there some other way?
[06:32:08] <BillCriswell> logikos: Are you using document.write or is something outside of your control using it?
[06:32:29] <logikos> i am but there is a reason for it
[06:32:32] <notchris> VectorX: I’m an IRC user
[06:32:34] <notchris> ;)
[06:32:40] <user> yes?
[06:32:49] <BillCriswell> logikos: Mind me asking why?
[06:33:01] <VectorX> more like an impersonator
[06:33:09] <BillCriswell> That is THE irc user.
[06:33:15] <user> yes?
[06:33:15] <notchris> Lol
[06:33:19] <logikos> i'm checking to see if something is loaded and if not i'm usting document.write to add it
[06:33:21] <user> which IRC?
[06:33:33] <BillCriswell> THE
[06:33:44] <notchris> user: There is no spoon.
[06:33:49] <logikos> kinda like this: <script>window.Modernizr || document.write('<script src="/public/resource/js/libs/modernizr.min.js"><\/script>')</script>
[06:33:52] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: weird. I time the script, takes 0.6s, but the network tab says there is 3.6s of wait time to receive the data
[06:33:57] <cordovafan8> that seems long to me
[06:34:21] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: That is a very long time.
[06:34:35] <BillCriswell> Well, depending on the data.
[06:34:43] <notchris> BillCriswell: The funny thing is that it isn’t, but for the web it is
[06:35:01] <notchris> If only people were more patient ;)
[06:35:11] <cordovafan8> the data is just some json
[06:35:18] <cordovafan8> it's not like gbs or mbs
[06:35:25] <cordovafan8> more like sub 100kb
[06:35:25] <notchris> I almost find comfort in a loading modal over instant results
[06:35:46] <KnightsOfNi> What is is the most reliable way to prevent the default action on an element? return false in the handler or e.preventDefault(); ?
[06:36:18] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: event.preventDefault();
[06:36:39] <BillCriswell> It's right in the name haha
[06:36:52] <KnightsOfNi> why is it placed at the end of the handler? it will do all stuff and only after know the prevent it
[06:37:43] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: It can be places anywhere in the handler.
[06:37:53] <Qwerty> Hello everyone
[06:37:59] <notchris> Hello Qwerty
[06:38:24] <notchris> Hopefully that makes up for the 99% of people who don’t say hello back :)
[06:38:50] <BillCriswell> If everyone said "Hello" back this channel would be insane.
[06:38:50] <notchris> Excluding BillCriswell, he always returns my morning greetings
[06:38:56] <notchris> BillCriswell++
[06:39:04] <notchris> We just need a channel for #hello
[06:39:08] <notchris> or #goodmorning
[06:39:28] <notchris> Or just a global IRC bot that simply replies good morning
[06:39:35] <QQQwerty> I have a suggestion, I read that I should discuss it first before attempting to implement it. Can I say what's my idea here?
[06:39:37] <notchris> Sorry, OT
[06:39:42] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: What if you request the json normally?
[06:39:54] <KnightsOfNi> but how does it know to prevent the default if you put it at the end, rather than at the beginning?
[06:40:23] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: what do you mean normally?
[06:40:28] <cordovafan8> oh not via ajax?
[06:40:39] <BillCriswell> If you just visit the url bar.
[06:40:58] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: I'm not sure I'm following you.
[06:42:17] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: http://jsbin.com/jatedi/1/edit?html,js,output here's a demo, you can elaborate on it more in there if you'd like then I can take a look.
[06:42:25] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: same request, total time 890ms, wait of 667ms
[06:42:29] <cordovafan8> so it's not server side
[06:43:19] <cordovafan8> vs 3.6s wait before
[06:43:21] <BillCriswell> It could still be server side. The server could be doing something different if it's an ajax request.
[06:43:31] <KnightsOfNi> BillCriswell, if you do a bunch of actions before the preventDefault method is called, how will the  handler know that it should preventdefault if it only sees that method at the end?
[06:44:10] <KnightsOfNi> Ok, that doesn't make any sense, nvm
[06:44:48] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: The "click" handler is more like a "beforeClick" in my eyes.
[06:45:07] <BillCriswell> well... beforeBrowsersClickHandler
[06:45:38] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: would that be at the httpd level or php? I know of no options in php/apache that might do ajax header filtering by default, and I don't see any set. The php script has no header checks or anything either
[06:46:36] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: What if you isolate the page to just the ajax request itself and get all your other code out of there?
[06:47:48] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: It can be done at the php level by checking the HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH header but I still don't see why someone would willfully slow it down haha
[06:48:22] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: yeah exactly haha. Good idea, I'll give it a whirl
[07:05:09] <KnightsOfNi> BillCriswell, a scenario could happen in a real big function where you return something before e.preventDefault() is reached
[07:06:41] <Tennis> has anyone ever come across something where your grabbing a data-val and it padds heaps of blank space on either side?
[07:07:09] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: Shouldn't be returning in an event callback more than likely.
[07:07:22] <BillCriswell> Tennis: I imagine the HTML has a lot of space in it.
[07:07:30] <KnightsOfNi> or some error that stops execution
[07:07:38] <Tennis> ill look at the source
[07:08:21] <BillCriswell> KnightsOfNi: Yeah, but that's a whole other problem.
[07:08:57] <BillCriswell> Is there a reason you're asking about where you should put it? Do you need to do it conditionally? If not it probably makes more sense to keep it towards the top.
[07:12:00] <delboy1978uk> what on earth does this mean? SyntaxError: missing formal parameter
[07:12:07] <cordovafan8> BillCriswell: Seems like with just vanilla jquery 1.9.1 the request takes ~1.08s round trip
[07:12:29] <delboy1978uk> jQuery('#more-or-less-filters').click(function(){ // etc });
[07:15:50] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8: In Chrome try it with fetch, just do:  fetch('url/').then(function (response) { response.json().then(function(data) { console.dir(data); })}); from the command line
[07:16:18] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: Don't think that code would produce that error.
[07:16:50] <delboy1978uk> i change jQuery to $ and it tells me its expecting a colon?
[07:17:57] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: the context is very important for errors like this.
[07:18:00] <delboy1978uk> ah, lol. stupid schoolboy error, please ignore!
[07:18:25] <delboy1978uk> and yes the preceding line as ever was the culprit. just a bit stealthy!
[07:18:44] <BillCriswell> word
[07:25:35] <Tennis> im getting a value with 2 and a half lines of whitespace either side of it and cant work out hwo
[07:26:07] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Do you have data-foo="\n\nsomething\n" or something?
[07:26:11] <Tennis> $("#uCdlRole").val($(this).attr("data-val"));
[07:26:19] <Tennis> no
[07:26:30] <Tennis> I'm grabbing a field that has like 5 characters in
[07:26:34] <BillCriswell> You have data-foo="exactly what you want"
[07:26:35] <BillCriswell> ?
[07:26:45] <Tennis> no its very dynamic
[07:27:03] <Tennis> its alot of  $(ID) = $(ID).val() and . text()
[07:27:38] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Do $('el').data('val').length and make sure it's what you're expecting.
[07:28:01] <BillCriswell> I occasionally run into hidden characters and that's how I normally find them.
[07:28:56] <adv_> i have 	document.addEventListener("keyup", function (event) {
[07:28:56] <adv_>  , but the events add up , how can i only do it once ?
[07:29:22] <BillCriswell> adv_: You only want to listen for one key up?
[07:29:37] <adv_> BillCriswell: yes
[07:29:50] <Tennis> 1 in length
[07:29:55] <adv_> BillCriswell: oh. no, sorry
[07:30:18] <adv_> i want to check if the listener exists so as to not reattach it if it exists
[07:30:45] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Is that what you're expecting?
[07:31:03] <Tennis>  unterminated string literal
[07:31:10] <Tennis> that sounds like my exact issue
[07:31:10] <BillCriswell> Why might you be attaching it more than once?
[07:31:31] <Tennis> yeha I set it on page load
[07:31:42] <Tennis> also on any relevent list items in the dropdown
[07:31:48] <BillCriswell> Tennis: Are you doing like.. data-val="<?php echo $foo ?>" or something?
[07:31:52] <Tennis> on document.ready rather not page load
[07:31:56] <Tennis> yeah
[07:32:01] <Tennis> server side sets it originally
[07:32:11] <Tennis> but iDoc script unfortunately not php
[07:33:27] <BillCriswell> Tennis: You need to make a demo cause your issue is snowballing.
[07:34:20] <adv_> BillCriswell: the code with the listener gets executed more than once sometimes
[07:34:32] <Tennis> hmmm
[07:35:41] <kot09> Say I have the following code: http://kopy.io/Wuzeg Am I allowed to add a parameter to the removeBlock() function? I would liek to add the id of the remove element
[07:36:13] <BillCriswell> adv_: You shoul write your code so there's no chance it can get reattached.
[07:37:30] <BillCriswell> kot09: You can do that. Is there more to do in removeBlock than just remove the block?
[07:39:02] <BillCriswell> Also, what are you expecting `remove` to be?
[07:39:38] <kot09> BillCrisswell: removeBlock basically hides a block. I have multiple blocks that call this function, which is why I would like to send the id
[07:39:39] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: finally got CORS disabled enough to try your code
[07:40:01] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: but I blew up my chrome in the process, can you repaste?
[07:40:27] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: fetch('url/').then(function (response) { response.json().then(function(data) { console.dir(data); })});
[07:40:45] <cordovafan8_> thanks
[07:42:17] <BillCriswell> kot09: It's hard to tell the best approach without knowing the whole situation. You can simply do removeBlock(remove.prop('id'))
[07:46:39] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: I'm getting an error when I run that with my url. It's a get request so there are many params, but everything is urlencoded. Should I run it without these? Here is the error
[07:46:56] <cordovafan8_> Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token < {stack: "SyntaxError: Unexpected token <", message: "Unexpected token <"}message: "Unexpected token <"stack: (...)get stack: function () { [native code] }set stack: function () { [native code] }__proto__: Error
[07:47:13] <cordovafan8_> I don't think there is even a < in the string, since everything is encoded
[07:48:23] <cordovafan8_> yeah even if I remove the get params it gives the same error
[07:50:26] <kot09> BillCriswell: Basically, I have a set of inputs that are repeated (First Name, Last Name, Age). At first, only one set is shown. If the user wants to add another sets, he clicks on Add, which shows another set. I have an "X" button beside every set, where, if clicked, removes that set (aka hides it and clears the values in that set).
[07:50:59] <kot09> BillCrisswell: for some reason, in the function removeBlock(remove.id), remove.Id is the Id of the last block I have, for some reason.
[07:51:13] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: I'm not sure. Tough to figure it out from afar.
[07:51:27] <cordovafan8_> it's jq 1.9.1 btw
[07:51:36] <BillCriswell> jonez: You probably want this.id
[07:51:40] <BillCriswell> kot09: ^^
[07:51:44] <BillCriswell> sorry jonez.
[07:52:30] <user> kot09, yes?
[07:54:51] <kot09> So here's a more detailed part of my code: http://kopy.io/pmJgk  I have a loop so that every remove button calls the removeBlock on clicked. However, for every button, the id sent to the method removeBlock is the id of my last block. Why is that?
[07:59:04] <BillCriswell> kot09: Do you have duplicate ids?
[08:00:16] <kot09> nope, every id is unique
[08:00:52] <BillCriswell> If you use a class you can just do $('.remove').on('click', function () { removeBlock(this.id); });
[08:01:09] <BillCriswell> Instead of looping through ids like that.
[08:03:17] <kot09> BillCrisswell: yep tried using 'this' instead of remove and it works now! Thanks alot!
[08:04:20] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: In case I can't get this to work, what was the fetch command intended to demonstrate?
[08:04:51] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: an ajax request outside of jquery.
[08:05:11] <cordovafan8_> ah ok
[08:05:40] <BillCriswell> i didn't know it was a cors request originally. that adds some complexity for sure
[08:09:44] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: yeah I'm testing from localhost to a server, but I can remove that, I was just trying to include the real round trip time by having it call out to a server. I also had to install an extension to get around the cors to begin with. I'll try withiout it
[08:11:15] <cordovafan8_> doesn't seem to make a difference
[08:14:23] <kot09> Is it possible to dynamically reposition elements? Going back to my block example, I would like to move #block1 under #block2
[08:14:44] <user> kot09, look at media queries
[08:25:33] <decx> man
[08:25:41] <decx> i'm already wasted
[08:25:46] <marduk1984> is it possible to alert, when ".new-class" is being added after the page has loaded(its not in the dom)?
[08:25:59] <decx> would you believe that it's a national holiday focused on getting good and drunk in germany
[08:26:38] <decx> you'll have to do that whereever you add your new lement
[08:26:55] <decx> i doubt you want to use mutators or whatever it was called
[08:32:40] <BillCriswell> kot09: You can do like $('#block2').before($('#block1')) but you sound like you're setting yourself up for some hurt.
[08:32:57] <adv_> i have something like #gallery2 div div div div img#foo in the DOM, what would be the selector for this?
[08:33:14] <BillCriswell> adv_: #foo
[08:33:42] <adv_> BillCriswell: i also have #gallery1 div div div div img#foo and i want to differentiate those
[08:33:50] <adv_> so i want the specific selector
[08:33:57] <kot09> BillCrisswell, is there a dom method where I can rearrange child nodes?
[08:34:02] <BillCriswell> adv_: That's invalid. You shouldn't have two elements with the same ids.
[08:34:53] <BillCriswell> kot09: There's .before() and .after()
[08:35:02] <adv_> BillCriswell: hm i get no error but i will change it to class .
[08:35:15] <adv_> but what would be the selector?
[08:35:41] <BillCriswell> #gallery1 #foo and #gallery2 #foo
[08:35:59] <BillCriswell> the divs seem to be useless specificity
[08:36:04] <adv_> ah
[08:38:43] <decx> for new browsers there are order thingies in css
[08:39:47] <adv_> BillCriswell: and what if i have #gallery2 in a var ? like var mygal = '#gallery2';
[08:40:04] <adv_> $(mygal #foo).css()  ?
[08:40:41] <BillCriswell> adv_: Might make more sense to have var $mygal = $('#gallery2'); then you can do $mygal.find('.foo').css('color', 'red');
[08:40:56] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah yeah, with that flex stuff I keep putting off.
[08:41:19] <adv_> BillCriswell: but i'm saving the find operation
[08:41:22] <BillCriswell>  I wonder if that effects screen reader order.
[08:42:10] <BillCriswell> you can still do var $foo = $mygal.find('.foo'); then $foo.css('background-color', 'hotpink');
[08:42:41] <adv_> BillCriswell: i mean , wouldn't it be better to save the .find and be specific about it?
[08:43:30] <BillCriswell> It would depend on what else you need to do. This is al opinion.
[08:43:32] <BillCriswell> all*
[08:46:28] <robertmaxrees> we talking about selector performance?!
[08:46:33] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: do you have a firefox alternative for that fetch command? Perhaps I can get it working there?
[08:47:40] <adv_> BillCriswell: hm i have var mygal = 'gallery2' instead of #gallery2 ( i don't control this ), how can i add the #
[08:47:51] <adv_> in order to use it as a selector
[08:48:06] <robertmaxrees> $('#' + mygal)
[08:48:07] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: Not sure.
[08:48:43] <BillCriswell> adv_: What robertmaxrees said, or if you want to be fancy $(document.getElementById(mygal))
[08:48:56] <robertmaxrees> aye - all kinds of options.
[08:49:22] <robertmaxrees> adv_ https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[08:49:37] <robertmaxrees> this is always a good read if you want the basics of selector performance.
[08:53:51] <jop008> How do I change flipswich label (jqm) the text of the label is too short
[08:58:14] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: I think doing this instead of using $.ajax should perform the same test right? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8567114/how-to-make-an-ajax-call-without-jquery
[08:58:34] <cordovafan8_> That works for me, and produces no high ttfb or stalled time
[08:59:10] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: Yeah. I don't know the issue then.
[08:59:11] <jop008>   tried this       .ui-flipswitch {          width: 15.875em;      }
[08:59:36] <cordovafan8_> BillCriswell: No that was a great test, it means it's directly related to my code, thanks!
[08:59:46] <BillCriswell> cordovafan8_: Awesome.
[09:00:18] <cordovafan8_> still have to solve it, but at least now I know it's not vanilla jq/jqm or chrome or something
[09:00:31] <cordovafan8_> and not my server code
[09:33:20] <wahibdon> is there a method by which I can include only parts of the jQuery library?  like, I don't want the animation functions but I want others.  is this a feature of the library?
[09:33:50] <BillCriswell> wahibdon: If you go to the repo on github they have directions for building it the way you want.
[09:34:04] <wahibdon> thank you.  I appreciate it, BillCriswell
[09:34:10] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:34:25] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#modules for the specifics
[09:35:30] <KnightsOfNi> If you retrieve alist of rows from the database with an ajax call, that need to be displayed in an ul, is it best to build up the html on the server and return that as a response, or build the html in the success function of the ajax call?
[09:35:56] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.  generally, do it in the .done() callback of the ajax call.
[09:36:18] <KnightsOfNi> why not in success() ?
[09:36:34] <decx> clientside tepmlates vs server gen is a heated topic
[09:36:54] <robertmaxrees> because promises are baller.
[09:36:55] <KnightsOfNi> so how do you do it decx ?
[09:37:14] <KnightsOfNi> I think it makes a mess in your JS
[09:37:15] <decx> i do both at times
[09:37:25] <decx> well that's what you use a templating engine for
[09:37:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:37:44] <KnightsOfNi> coffeescript?
[09:37:50] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:37:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a language that compiles to JS.
[09:38:05] <KnightsOfNi> I use a templating engine in php
[09:38:13] <KnightsOfNi> but never heard of one for js
[09:38:13] <decx> underscore has its own, and then there's handlebars, mustache and a whole lotta more
[09:38:16] <robertmaxrees> you can use handlebars, underscore, etc.
[09:38:26] <KnightsOfNi> oh ok
[09:38:28] <decx> some of them have php equivalents
[09:38:43] <decx> ie mustache iirc
[09:39:32] <KnightsOfNi> I already have underscore loaded in the project, I thought it was just for efficient sorting and data seeking
[09:40:09] <robertmaxrees> it's actually not that great for that any more.
[09:40:29] <robertmaxrees> and a lot of the stuff people use out of it is available in native JS anyway.
[09:40:48] <robertmaxrees> but yeah check out http://underscorejs.org/#template
[09:41:59] <KnightsOfNi> ok thx
[09:43:31] <verilux> I have a jquery carousel plug-in im using and i think it's causing a gap between the body and the footer. I have tried removing all paddings/weirdo margins but cannot isolate what is causing this gap, can someone please take a look at http://603pc.com/testing/projects
[09:50:59] <checkit> Hey guys... Any chance someone can help me understand why the data attribut isn't being appended to <a> http://jsfiddle.net/r6nn3pa1/2/
[09:53:04] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't show up in the html.
[09:53:51] <robertmaxrees> verilux i'm seeingn empty h5 tag that's causing your headaches.
[09:54:21] <verilux> yes that was it, thank you robertmaxrees
[09:54:34] <robertmaxrees> checkit does that make sense?
[09:55:13] <checkit> robertmaxrees: It does thank you.
[10:02:31] <jani_> Hello. I have a question in uisng @media query in css. can I ask it here.
[10:03:33] <robertmaxrees> jani_ you'll likely get better and faster help in #css, but feel free to put it out there.
[10:04:36] <jani_> robertmaxrees. let me share what I write
[10:05:52] <jani_> can anyone tell me that whether I do it correct or wrong http://pastebin.com/DgWxF2pP
[10:06:43] <checkit> robertmaxrees: What about something like this. I'm having to work with a JS api so I'm wondering how I can, in a sense, "object-ify" function calls. Consider this fiddle a blueprint for what I'm trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/r6nn3pa1/4/
[10:07:24] <robertmaxrees> checkit and let me guess, loadRaces doesn't work, right?
[10:08:32] <checkit> That's correct... I will eventually pull those methose out into a custom extension but I'm not quite sure how to work with the (function(SDK){}); wrapper...
[10:08:38] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[10:08:46] <robertmaxrees> welcome to variable scope in js.
[10:08:56] <robertmaxrees> loadRaces only exists within that IIFE.
[10:09:01] <checkit> I was worried about that.
[10:09:07] <robertmaxrees> you can access it there and within "child" scopes.
[10:09:28] <robertmaxrees> what benefit does that IIFE give you, though?
[10:10:13] <checkit> Obviously this approach wont' work either: http://jsfiddle.net/r6nn3pa1/5/
[10:10:30] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:10:36] <robertmaxrees> it would, but it makes no sense.
[10:10:42] <robertmaxrees> you already have a scope in that function.
[10:10:48] <robertmaxrees> using the IIFE gives you no benefit here.
[10:11:01] <checkit> How can I pass it the SDK instance?
[10:11:13] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to pass it specially?
[10:11:49] <checkit> I'm not able to access the SDK instance otherwise. As far as I know.
[10:11:50] <robertmaxrees> you already have access to the APP object in loadRaces()
[10:11:54] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[10:12:15] <robertmaxrees> APP already exists in that scope.
[10:13:26] <checkit> robertmaxrees: Like so: http://jsfiddle.net/r6nn3pa1/7/
[10:13:58] <robertmaxrees> right.  you already have that context, but this all looks really silly imo.
[10:14:48] <checkit> The sillyness is what I'm trying to get away from. It's ugly.
[10:16:18] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting it even further fwiw.
[10:16:57] <robertmaxrees> what is this APP.SDK ?
[10:17:23] <checkit> robertmaxrees: https://oth.nectorx.com/static/js/public/sdk.js
[10:17:53] <decx> i visted the site and know even less
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's not really helpful.
[10:18:03] <decx> what's an appstax analytics platform
[10:18:10] <xniz> hey anyone know why the browser wouldn't fire the scroll events/
[10:18:22] <robertmaxrees> xniz something is capturing and blocking them.
[10:18:25] <xniz> or some common problems/reasoning behind why it wouldnt fire
[10:18:54] <xniz> robbyoconnor; i just have a basic alert command, to alert me when the user has scrolled. but it doesn't detect the event
[10:19:06] <robertmaxrees> right, because somebody might be catching and prevent it.
[10:19:09] <robertmaxrees> xniz or you're binding to the incorrect element.
[10:20:16] <igcewieling> I am trying to get the first div contained in the 3rd cell of a table row.  I could use some classes, but wanted try using selectors first.    http://jsfiddle.net/59c67xvx/ is the latest of several tries.  any advice is appreciated.
[10:20:38] <igcewieling> I'm sure I'm doing something dumb.
[10:20:57] <robertmaxrees> is that particular element semantially important?
[10:21:10] <xniz> robbyoconnor; all i have is $(window).scroll(function() { alert("the window has scrolled"); });
[10:21:19] <robertmaxrees> xniz wrong username.
[10:21:25] <xniz> oh sorry
[10:21:28] <robertmaxrees> twice now ;)
[10:21:34] <xniz> excuse me :P
[10:21:45] <robertmaxrees> open your console - any errors or anything?
[10:21:51] <xniz> robertmaxrees none :/
[10:21:52] <igcewieling> was that for me?
[10:22:06] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling the question about semantic importance, yeah.
[10:22:41] <xniz> robertmaxrees; http://brighterboats.hostei.com/ is a live demo
[10:23:18] <xniz> robertmaxrees the web content is fairly minimal, so i intend on keeping everything inside of the index file and scrolling between div's for each page
[10:23:56] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: heh, maybe.   I will have the correct row in a variable at the time.
[10:24:01] <xniz> however, I haven't had any luck nor the experience with scroll events :/
[10:24:13] <igcewieling> What sort of semantic changes are you thinking of?
[10:24:56] <robertmaxrees> use classes if it's important
[10:25:06] <robertmaxrees> xniz something weird is going on here.
[10:25:10] <igcewieling> ah.  That is plan b
[10:25:21] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling that should be plan a.
[10:25:31] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling makes things easier to reach and all that ;)
[10:25:32] <igcewieling> well, plan c.  plan b is to add another collumn and avoid all this silliness.
[10:25:53] <joelbrewer> hey folks, I've got a weird error where "jQuery.when" is returning undefined.
[10:26:04] <xniz> robertmaxrees i agree... :/
[10:26:12] <robertmaxrees> xniz yeah you've got some weirdass css going on.  if i remove the overflow-x hidden, it works fine.
[10:26:15] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: if I add another column, do you still suggest using classes?
[10:26:22] <xniz> robertmaxrees i was thinking that too
[10:26:27] <joelbrewer> any idea why that would be happening?
[10:26:29] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling if you need to target specific elements, yes.
[10:26:33] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer what version of jquery?
[10:26:38] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: thanks.
[10:27:02] <xniz> robertmaxrees ill keep the overflow off for now. thanks !
[10:27:09] <robertmaxrees> xniz yeah start simpler.
[10:27:46] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: what's the easiest way to check? It's a javascript widget I created that's being loaded as a plugin
[10:28:02] <joelbrewer> it's used on a number of different Shopify websites
[10:28:04] <xniz> robertmaxrees i  have a tendency to disable horizontal scrolling :/
[10:28:05] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer jQuery.fn.jquery
[10:28:20] <robertmaxrees> xniz disable by styling things correctly.
[10:28:24] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:28:25] <joelbrewer> mm. 1.4.2
[10:28:37] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer there's your answer :)
[10:28:39] <joelbrewer> so .when probably isn't defined in that version.
[10:28:40] <xniz> robertmaxrees i agree. :)
[10:28:49] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/ - check the "Version added"
[10:29:16] <joelbrewer> alright. so, given that this is a plugin, I suppose I should load the version of jquery I need first and not rely on it to be loaded
[10:29:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:29:33] <robertmaxrees> you should rely on the end user supplying the correct version.
[10:30:28] <joelbrewer> well, it's some javascript that gets installed via a shopify plugin. Our end users just click "install" in the shopify app store.
[10:30:50] <joelbrewer> we can't rely on them to supply the correct version of jquery
[10:30:52] <robertmaxrees> who controls the version of jquery on the site?
[10:31:21] <robertmaxrees> because you really shouldn't ever load the entire lib yourself if you're a 3rd party.
[10:33:33] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: hmm. I'm just a shopify plugin developer. I suppose the jquery version is defined in the site templates.
[10:34:03] <robertmaxrees> loading your own comes with a bunch of caveats.  you should instead require a bare minimum version of jquery.
[10:34:10] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're in for a world of hurt.
[10:36:12] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: alright, cool.
[10:40:47] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: looks like this article covers what I'm encountering: https://docs.shopify.com/api/unlinked/using-javascript-responsibly
[10:41:00] <joelbrewer> specifically, this section: https://docs.shopify.com/api/unlinked/using-javascript-responsibly#use-jquery
[10:41:59] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> that runs counter to what the rest of us suggest.  wowzer.
[10:43:54] <robertmaxrees> also doesnt seem to care if you stomp all over the global jquery namespace if you're using a version of jq greater than 1.7
[10:47:27] <Falbala> Hello
[10:47:51] <Falbala> I have a slight problem
[10:48:51] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer ooooh nvm i see what this is trying to do.  power on then i guess.  just seems weird that the platform suggests that you load multiple versions of jquery like that.
[10:48:53] <robertmaxrees> whatevs.
[10:48:54] <Falbala> I use a class for changing something on a click event, and then I remove the class from the clicked item. but it seems to be in the jquery object
[10:49:20] <Falbala> so the event is still valid for the already changed item
[10:49:21] <robertmaxrees> Falbala are you doing $myThing = $('.someClass'); ?
[10:49:45] <robertmaxrees> or $('.someClass').on('click'
[10:50:14] <Falbala> $("someclass").click(
[10:50:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[10:50:30] <Falbala> and then .removeClass('someclass')
[10:50:34] <robertmaxrees> that binds a listener to everything that has $('.someClass') when you make the case.
[10:50:37] <robertmaxrees> *call
[10:50:43] <robertmaxrees> removing the calss doesn't remove the listener.
[10:50:52] <robertmaxrees> *class
[10:51:02] <robertmaxrees> are there a lot of elements with this class on them?
[10:51:09] <Falbala> ok, so how do I remove the listener only in this element?
[10:51:26] <Falbala> depends
[10:51:32] <robertmaxrees> then use a delegated listener :)
[10:51:44] <robertmaxrees> $('someParent').on('click', '.someclass', function() {});
[10:51:52] <robertmaxrees> that will solve your headaches.
[10:53:35] <Falbala> hmm, the next parent would be a span or the body
[10:53:49] <robertmaxrees> Falbala the "parent" should be a shared common element.
[10:53:53] <robertmaxrees> if it's the body, so be it.
[10:54:15] <Falbala> ok, thanks I try it :)
[10:57:54] <xniz> robertmaxrees; http://brighterboats.hostei.com/
[10:58:08] <xniz> I was able to get the effect i wanted. (scroll down and up with mouse wheel)
[10:58:08] <robertmaxrees> D:
[10:58:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid doing that if possible.
[10:58:37] <xniz> yea?
[10:58:40] <robertmaxrees> hijacking simple behavior is rarely a good idea.
[10:58:44] <robertmaxrees> users find it frustrating.
[11:00:35] <xniz> hmm alright.
[11:05:43] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: so you think I should just follow their advice?
[11:05:55] <robertmaxrees> joelbrewer if that's the way they do it, yeah.
[11:06:12] <robertmaxrees> just runs counter to what I'd normally tell a plugin dev.
[11:06:24] <robertmaxrees> just be careful not to stomp all over the global namespace.
[11:06:45] <joelbrewer> robertmaxrees: hmm. alright.
[11:20:07] <tkup> Hi. I'm catching a submit action ($().submit(function(e){});) and then I make an AJAX call that retrieves several HTML forms then loads them into the save div (where the submit had come from). The first submit works fine. But the subsequent submits are gone unanswered. Meaning the submit action isn't triggered and the ajax call isn't made. It remains disabled until I reload the whole page. What do I need to do after the first catch of a submit action?
[11:21:22] <robertmaxrees> tkup you mean the event binding breaks for the new forms?
[11:22:04] <robertmaxrees> like, the new forms don't react to the code you have in the .submit() ?
[11:28:16] <robertmaxrees> tkup if that's the case, check out the delegated syntax for .on()
[12:02:38] <cordovafan8_> Hello. Was the dialog data-role deprecated in jquery mobile 1.4 or just the data-rel?
[12:03:13] <cordovafan8_> I'm trying to update jq and jqm to the latest version and all of my ajax queries stopped working :/
[12:13:09] <ntcbow> that's weird... https://github.com/fasttime/jquery-screwed
[12:17:35] <cj> is it more costly to store a reference to an object or an integer?  I've got a LOT of objects indexed by ID and I'm wondering whether I should place a reference to the object in a data structure or just the unique ID and then later do the de-reference manually.
[12:19:02] <GarrettW> I'm having some trouble modifying the Vantage theme for Wordpress. It has this sticky menu functionality that, using jQuery, wraps the <nav> element in a <div id="sticky-container"> when the page is scrolled past a certain point.... I've commented out the wrapping code, but somehow it's still happening.
[12:19:29] <GarrettW> if anyone wants to help I can link you to the dev site i'm working on
[12:38:01] <cordovafan8_> Hello. I have previously been using $(document).delegate("pageid", "pageshow", function() {}); to trigger some events. Is this now deprecated in jqm 1.4+ ?
[12:38:17] <cordovafan8_> I'm reading that I can no longer filter by page id?
[12:39:35] <robertLunch> .on()
[12:39:50] <robertLunch> i mentioned this a while ago - delegate has been deprecated.
[12:40:07] <robertmaxrees> well, superseded
[12:41:48] <cordovafan8_> completely?
[12:42:07] <cordovafan8_> I didn't see anything about it in the deprecation lists or upgrade guide
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> "As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method."
[12:43:54] <cordovafan8_> ok, it seems that .on still has a selector option for pageids though, so there is that
[12:47:29] <tkup> robertLunch yes that's pretty much it. I have <div id="container"><table><tr id="1"><form id="id1">...</form></tr><tr id="2"><form id="id2">...</form></tr></table></div>. And I  have this: $('[id^=id]').submit(function(e){});. I'm also replacing div#container afresh via ajax whenever a submit happens. But on refresh, the submit buttons don't trigger anymore
[12:47:43] <robertmaxrees> tkf yeah you want the delegated syntax of .on()
[12:47:43] <tkup> robertmaxrees ^
[12:47:49] <robertmaxrees> err, tkup
[12:47:58] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8_ .on() has a delegated syntaxt - that's what you likely want.,
[12:48:27] <cordovafan8_> yeah it's listed there on the delegate page, right?
[12:50:22] <cordovafan8_> hrmm
[12:50:51] <cordovafan8_> $(document).on("pagecontainershow", "pageid", function() {}); should be right?
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> roughly.
[12:51:35] <tkup> robertmaxrees I wanted .submit() to preserve the URL I post to via .ajax. Each form has its own URL. won't .on() break the .ajax call?
[12:51:52] <robertmaxrees> tkup .submit() uses .on() under the hood.
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> paste up your code i'll show you.
[12:52:31] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: then I don't think the pagecontainershow event is firing, because the function is not executing ?
[12:52:48] <Kartagis> could I login to a PHP system with jquery?
[12:52:59] <cordovafan8_> yes
[12:53:00] <robertmaxrees> try  $(document).on("pagecontainershow", function() {});, cordovafan8_
[12:53:15] <Kartagis> or do I need to login to database?
[12:54:03] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: that triggers it, so it appears $(document) with a selector like that is no-go?
[12:54:16] <Kartagis> cordovafan8_: was that "yes" for me?
[12:54:23] <cordovafan8_> yes
[12:55:42] <Kartagis> cordovafan8_: do I need something like? $.post('http://www.example.com/login.php'...
[12:55:51] <Kartagis> like*
[12:57:35] <cordovafan8_> probably, depends how you're setup. grab the form data via selectors, submit that as data with an ajax query to a script which does your validation, have the script return true or false on successfull login, then read that value in the ajax success function and act accordingly
[12:57:48] <cordovafan8_> script = php
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8_ that means the element in question isn't emitting the event.
[12:58:41] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: which is odd, because it was doing pageshow before, but that is deprecated now, so I swapped to pagecontainershow
[12:58:56] <cordovafan8_> and pagebeforeshow is also firing
[12:59:05] <robertmaxrees> what is "pageid" supposed to be?
[13:00:07] <tkup> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/8a305c5e7b75
[13:00:15] <cordovafan8_> it's a selector for a jqm data-role = page
[13:00:27] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8_ right - so could you give me an example of a valid one?
[13:00:50] <cordovafan8_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21801315/jqm-1-4-1-the-new-event-pagecontainershow << this appears to be the same problem
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> please answer my question.
[13:01:41] <tkup> robertmaxrees: I have two forms in that example but there are many more on average
[13:01:46] <robertmaxrees> tkf right
[13:01:52] <robertmaxrees> err tkup right - one sec.
[13:02:04] <robertmaxrees> are they all within #fcontainer?
[13:02:27] <robertmaxrees> tkup also, your html isn't valid.
[13:03:18] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8_ ...
[13:03:19] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: sorry, what do you mean specifically? You're right I may have broken my page by upgrading the data-role content etc shown in the upgrade guide.
[13:03:32] <robertmaxrees> what's a vlaid pageId?
[13:03:42] <cordovafan8_> #home is what I'm using
[13:03:43] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about how event delegation works.
[13:03:46] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:03:48] <tkup> robertmaxrees yes all within. that's the same div I replace on successful ajax call. Is the HTML within fcontainer invalid or do you mean the snippet itself isn't complete?
[13:04:05] <robertmaxrees> tkup oh.
[13:04:26] <robertmaxrees> and it's invalid because you have <tr><form><td>
[13:04:41] <robertmaxrees> the only valid child of <tr> is <td> - you can't smack a form in there randomly last i checked.
[13:04:54] <robertmaxrees> tkup fixee.org/paste/n5h0kwa/ you want something like this.
[13:05:16] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8_ http://fixee.org/paste/p2q3cil/
[13:05:19] <robertmaxrees> this should work then.
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> if it doesn't, try http://fixee.org/paste/p2q3cil/#url=j04jt3p
[13:06:53] <robertmaxrees> tkup basically, you want to attach the event listener to a parent element that doesn't go away.  document is usually a safe bet, though binding lower is a little smarter.
[13:09:08] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: neither work unfortunately. It's looking more like the stackoverflow is right :/
[13:10:03] <robertmaxrees> the $(document).on("pagecontainershow", function(e) {}) didn't work at all?
[13:10:06] <robertmaxrees> then you have another problem.
[13:10:26] <robertmaxrees> because SO agrees that should work.
[13:10:38] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/27823663/923919
[13:12:07] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: without the selector works fine
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:12:25] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why?
[13:12:28] <cordovafan8_> but I misread your fixee
[13:12:47] <robertmaxrees> because it's a pretty basic concept.
[13:15:00] <tkup> robertmaxrees. Thanks. I tried to click submit again but it's not running the .on('submit'...) code again. Do I need to add anything else in the .on() handler?
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> tkup you need more than just .on()
[13:16:03] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/n5h0kwa/#url=6ae7icw sorry meant this
[13:16:15] <robertmaxrees> you need $(document).on('submit', '#fcontainer [id^=delete]', function(e) {})
[13:17:56] <cordovafan8_> robertmaxrees: I'm not sure I do understand. I see that the id is blank, so the event is not triggered by that element, but that contradicts previous behavior. Why would the upgrade guide recommend replacing pageshow with pagecontainershow if page elements don't trigger the event?
[13:18:13] <robertmaxrees> it's changing where the event is emitted from.
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> it's no longer emitting from the element in question.
[13:18:34] <robertmaxrees> you're confused about what .on() does, basically.
[13:25:23] <tkup> robertmaxrees sorry to bug you again :(. Now I'm doing $(document).on('submit', '#fcontainer [id^=delete]', function(e){". It gets triggered the very first time I refresh the page. but that code doesn't runt the second time I press "another" submit button on the page (unless I CTRL-R again and press submit)
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> tkup that doesn't make any sense.  i'd need to see a more fleshed out version/
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> tkup that means that the new submit buttons aren't matching the selector in that second argument.
[13:27:31] <robertmaxrees> try $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(e){
[13:29:57] <zorph> I have a dropdown menu - but the li click is overriding the sub menu <a href...hmmm howto fix
[13:30:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:30:35] <zorph> like $('.menu > li').click(meny_open)
[13:30:52] <zorph> menu_open is also being triggered when a sub item is clicked..
[13:30:56] <robertmaxrees> easy.
[13:31:04] <zorph> because its' contained within the parent li
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> right - run e.stopPropagation() for clicks on those anchors.
[13:32:06] <robertmaxrees> could do something like http://fixee.org/paste/7wjj7ox/
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> or check the e.target within your current event handler and conditionally do the same thing.
[13:34:01] <zorph> duh..I was returning false on menu_open
[13:34:09] <zorph> that's all that was killing the href
[13:34:20] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's what you were talking about.
[13:34:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that runs e.preventDefault(); and e.stopPropagation(); iirc
[14:33:21] <doug16k_> tkup, the form id contains "delete" ?
[14:34:00] <doug16k_> the submit event comes from the form, not the submit button
[14:34:24] * tasaif is a junior dev looking for a job
[14:43:04] * robertmaxrees would like some tacos
[14:45:55] <lintguy> How can i check if an attribute exists without getting undefined errors in the console?
[14:47:45] <lintguy> I'm doing this: if($('.saveButton').length < 0) {console.log('test')}
[14:47:53] <lintguy> but it still gives "undefined" error
[14:47:54] <robertmaxrees> if ($('#someid').prop('lol'));
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> an attribute, or an element?
[14:48:09] <lintguy> attribute.
[14:48:22] <robertmaxrees>  if($('.saveButton').length < 0) {console.log('test')} doesn't test an attribute of anything.
[14:48:54] <lintguy> Sorry, that was just to see if any element gave undefined and it seems all selectors do
[14:49:07] <robertmaxrees> is jquery loaded?
[14:49:11] <lintguy> Ofc
[14:49:23] <robertmaxrees> all selectors are giving you undefined?
[14:49:34] <lintguy> No, those that exist gives the proper response
[14:49:47] <lintguy> But i want to suppress the undefined error
[14:49:56] <lintguy> Or is that not even possible?
[14:50:38] <robertmaxrees> there should be no undefined error.
[14:51:27] <lintguy> There is, try it yourself
[14:51:29] <robertmaxrees> you might get an undefined return, but as long as you're not trying to do something it with you should be fine.
[14:51:33] <lintguy> i tried in both chrome and firefox
[14:51:39] <robertmaxrees> $('#someId').prop('id') returns "undefined", not an error.
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> undefined is a legitimate return value.
[14:51:51] <lintguy> Hm, ok
[14:51:56] <lintguy> so it's not possible to suppress that
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to suppress anything - what's the actual problem you're having?
[14:52:17] <robertmaxrees> like, can you show what's giving you trouble?
[14:52:37] <lintguy> Not a problem, just don't want to pollute the console since i'm doing many of these checks throughout the project
[14:52:49] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't get anything in the console.
[14:52:54] <robertmaxrees> are you getting TypeErrors?
[14:53:52] <lintguy> https://i.imgur.com/Bf5DZlN.jpg
[14:54:02] <robertmaxrees> you won't see those in normal code.
[14:54:08] <robertmaxrees> you're only seeing those because you're in the console.
[14:54:33] <lintguy> Ok, so i'll just ignore that then
[14:54:41] <monk12> hey all, just curious, can you redirect with window.location.href to a url that has a hash tag? my server side php script seems to strip off the hash when it goes to things like iphones killing my angular app
[14:55:01] <monk12> but i need the redirect to split up some traffic with a 50/50 test (old website vs angular # website).
[14:55:17] <robertmaxrees> lintguy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sma66syt/
[14:55:33] <lintguy> monk12: write windows.location and you can see what values are available
[14:55:34] <robertmaxrees> monk12 "hash tag"? you mean the # symbol?
[14:55:59] <robertmaxrees> monk12 and your server strips # because that's only availablke client-side.  servers ignore it.
[14:56:10] <robertmaxrees> so yes, you can use js to push people to a url with a hash
[14:56:10] <monk12> yup im usin gwindow.location.href = 'http://www.example.com/site1/#/angularappparams=101'
[14:56:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  you can also set window.location.hash if you want.
[14:56:41] <monk12> but thats now working either. so would i set href and hash?
[14:56:43] <monk12> both?
[14:56:48] <monk12> its an external domain
[14:56:51] <robertmaxrees> you should just need to set href.
[14:57:02] <monk12> eh not working. let me setup a test example.
[14:59:35] <monk12> robertmaxrees:  https://www.acurianhealth.com/redirector/index.html see that 1 liner in desktop works... but doesn't work in Safari on Apple
[15:00:01] <monk12> all it does is this: window.location.href="https://www.acurianhealth.com/questionnaire/#/welcome?pn=800CVMSTST&GID=CLIENT_A";
[15:00:24] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: Why the frack do i get undefined notice in the console on firefox and chrome on other sites but not on jsfiddle?
[15:00:46] <robertmaxrees> lintguy you mean when you put the code in the fiddle itself?
[15:01:12] <robertmaxrees> monk12 where's the code that's setting the location?
[15:01:54] <monk12> robertmaxrees:  in a simple tag in head <script>$(function(){ thatCode... });</script>.
[15:02:00] <robertmaxrees> i see it now.  one sec.
[15:02:24] <tkup> robertmaxrees: do you mind if I pm you access to the app that has the .on('submit') issue? I've exhausted all attempts :(
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> tkup i'd rather you setup a fiddle to show me instead.
[15:03:13] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: If i paste that code ty any other page and open up the console, i get this https://i.imgur.com/h6vKboL.jpg
[15:03:26] <robertmaxrees> lintguy i wouldn't worry about it all that much.
[15:03:34] <robertmaxrees> you're worrying abouyt non-issues...
[15:03:50] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: I know, but it annoys me...
[15:04:00] <robertmaxrees> then don't write code using the console?
[15:04:01] <lintguy> guess i'll ignore it then
[15:04:15] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: But it shows up from the code as well
[15:04:22] <robertmaxrees> lintguy in separate files?
[15:04:26] <robertmaxrees> because it shouldn't.
[15:04:28] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: only one file
[15:04:36] <lintguy> i know it shouldn't
[15:04:59] <lintguy> You can try it yourself, i took one random page http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8974949/how-to-test-to-see-if-jquery-object-exists
[15:05:13] <robertmaxrees> right and put code in the consoel and it breaks right?
[15:05:14] <lintguy> open console there and paste it, and it will send undefined to the console
[15:05:17] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:05:25] <robertmaxrees> that's expected.
[15:05:34] <monk12> robertmaxrees: any ideas on redirecting with hash. wasnt sure if you had an iphone to see yourself that its not carrying the app through and stripping out the hash
[15:05:38] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't happen if you put your code in an external file.
[15:05:45] <robertmaxrees> monk12 i'm still looking.
[15:05:50] <robertmaxrees> monk12 this looks like a safari bug.
[15:06:09] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: i'll try that then
[15:07:33] <monk12> darn. k im researching as well. maybe I can use html5mode of my angular app to remove the /#/
[15:08:54] <robertmaxrees> monk12 yeah, this looks like an issue with the wasy safari handles setting window.location.  i'd search around and see what you can find.
[15:09:40] <monk12> K thanks robertmaxrees
[15:09:50] <robertmaxrees> good luck.  lemme know if you find a fix :)
[15:10:41] <arc_> so ... this is a bit confusing
[15:10:47] <arc_> The complementary operation to .get(), which accepts an index and returns a DOM node, .index() can take a DOM node and returns an index. Suppose we have a simple unordered list on the page:
[15:10:58] <arc_> however, https://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[15:11:12] <arc_> Description: Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request.
[15:11:35] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: I keept getting the error, so i restarted chrome where it was occuring and now it's gone….
[15:11:47] <arc_> internet
[15:11:49] <lintguy> Super annoying
[15:11:52] <robertmaxrees> lintguy that's NOT AN ERROR.
[15:12:02] <robertmaxrees> it's the console providing feedback.
[15:12:12] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: I know, but i was getting it from the external file
[15:12:14] <robertmaxrees> arc_ there are two versions of .get()
[15:12:18] <lintguy> that's why it was annoying!
[15:12:29] <robertmaxrees> there's a $.get() and an actual .get
[15:12:33] <lintguy> but all i needed to do was restart chrome
[15:12:43] <arc_> where is the documentation for the latter?
[15:13:13] <arc_> nevermind i foudn it
[15:14:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:29:54] <arc_> okay, i'm kind of at a loss here. i need to be able to select the previous and next rows of a table, or at least find the index of what row "this" is in
[15:30:10] <arc_> var rowNo = $(this).closest("table").children().children().index(this);
[15:30:15] <arc_> that apparently doesn't work
[15:30:37] <arc_> If .index() is called on a collection of elements and a DOM element or jQuery object is passed in, .index() returns an integer indicating the position of the passed element relative to the original collection.
[15:30:54] <robertmaxrees> .children().children() likely isn't what you want.
[15:31:12] <arc_> i thought it would just be children() but that selected tbody, not the array of rows
[15:31:25] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle to show what you're trying to do.
[15:31:45] <arc_> i can just link the site i'm working on
[15:31:59] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are preferred because we can modoify the code.
[15:32:11] <arc_> hm ok
[15:32:42] <robertmaxrees> so you have a basic table, right? http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j094L0h1/
[15:33:48] <robertmaxrees> and you want to get the previous and next rows, right?
[15:34:35] <arc_> i have this set up, if i can just figure out how to create a share link. do i have to sign up
[15:34:45] <arc_> ah here we go https://jsfiddle.net/0cyy8dnL/
[15:35:02] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[15:35:05] <robertmaxrees> waaaay too much going on there.
[15:35:23] <arc_> howso
[15:35:33] <robertmaxrees> over 6,000 ;lines of html.
[15:36:06] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do here?
[15:36:22] <arc_> if you click on a square, you'll see that it changes the class of that TD
[15:36:44] <arc_> if you click on an immediately horizontally adjacent square, you'll see that it connects the two
[15:36:47] <arc_> so it's now a rectangle
[15:36:52] <arc_> i can do that with prev and next
[15:36:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:37:11] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to select the previous and next tr tags, right?
[15:37:13] <arc_> i need to be able to find the immediately vertically adjacent squares
[15:37:16] <arc_> yes
[15:37:56] <decx> get your td per row and then grab that of the next and previous row
[15:38:00] <decx> index that is
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah one sec.
[15:38:05] <robertmaxrees> you're making this overly complicated.
[15:38:12] <arc_> i had a feeling i was
[15:38:17] <arc_> decx that's what i'm trying to do ;)
[15:38:34] <decx> you have 64 td and 4 per row
[15:38:49] <decx> so you get the index of the active and remove or add 4 to that
[15:38:53] <decx> or 5
[15:38:55] <decx> something liek that
[15:39:00] <decx> and then grab that cell
[15:39:04] <decx> with eq
[15:39:14] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j094L0h1/1/
[15:39:18] <robertmaxrees> do grab the previous tr.
[15:39:28] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('tr').prev()
[15:40:08] <arc_> so it's $(this).closest('tr').prev().get(colNo)
[15:40:15] <robertmaxrees> .eq
[15:40:17] <robertmaxrees> not .get
[15:40:35] <arc_> what's the difference?
[15:40:43] <robertmaxrees> eq gets the raw dom node, which means no jquery methods.
[15:40:44] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j094L0h1/2/
[15:40:49] <robertmaxrees> eq gets you the jquery object.
[15:40:57] <arc_> okay, i'll mess with it. thank you
[15:41:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j094L0h1/3/
[15:41:11] <robertmaxrees> decx has a way, too.
[15:41:22] <arc_> i tried looking on stack exchange, but ... yeah.
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> SO is hit or miss.
[15:42:01] <arc_> hm that's interesting decx
[15:42:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/j094L0h1/4/ even further
[15:42:27] <decx> messing around too http://jsfiddle.net/decx/j094L0h1/5/
[15:42:39] <robertmaxrees> haha
[15:43:28] <decx> thanks to eq it loops to
[15:43:37] <arc_> yeah i wasn't aware it would loop
[15:44:00] <arc_> all right, thanks guys
[15:57:35] <arc_> all right, that actually worked. now i just have a css problem, lol
[16:00:13] <arc_> i actually don't think i can do this with only borders : /
[16:04:11] <uskerine> when I forget a simple comma  no code is executed from that .JS file and no error is provided in the CONSOLE of the browser, is there any alternative way to detect such mistakes? sometimes I got stuck at those. thanks
[16:05:59] <Woet> uskerine: put some code on www.jsfiddle.net that demonstrates what you mean
[16:07:15] <uskerine> I'll try to replicate the issue in a simpler environment, I am using a hell of plugins
[16:07:58] <uskerine> it specifically happens when I forgot a comma  in bootstrap dialog (for example) title: 'Borrar usuario', <-- this comma
[16:17:59] <Woet> uskerine: i doubt it.
[16:57:32] <tasaif> uskerine: hella*
[17:01:42] <pauled> I am following this example http://jqueryui.com/button/#toolbar of mediaplayer toolbar. But I don't see how to use it with mine http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/m7paqopg/
[17:02:56] <pauled> I don't see how I can call .play here
[17:33:59] <pauled> How I can use this mediabar
[17:38:56] <pauled> How I am supposed to call it with .play() .pause() etc?
[17:39:00] <pauled> http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/m7paqopg/
[17:39:05] <pauled> Please
[17:41:34] <decx> reference your track somewhere with var song = document.getElementById('blast') and use song.play() and song.pause() in your event handlers
[17:46:56] <pauled> I am lost, I tried $("#blast").play() somewhere but getting invalid js
[17:48:08] <decx> by now you should realize that jquery objects dont have access to native functions
[17:48:25] <decx> you've been here long enough
[17:49:48] <pauled> I am here since a week ^^
[17:50:40] <decx> that should suffice
[17:53:02] <pauled> really? In one week I learned js?
[17:53:40] <decx> that part of it yes
[17:53:54] <decx> either way it'S a stream, i don't even know how that works
[17:54:21] <pauled> Should you ask your boss to hire me then. ^^
[17:59:33] <decx> well if you figure out how to fast-forward a stream then let me know
[18:00:09] <decx> we're gonna go back to the year 2015 and buy a sports almanach... wait
[18:01:04] <pauled> I am just trying to use the Play Stop buttons
[18:02:22] <decx> already told you like what 15 minutes ago?
[18:03:12] <lambdumb> is it possible to tell when a CSS keyframe animation with an iteration-count of infinite has gone through an iteration?
[18:03:12] <lambdumb>  as in, with a js event listener
[18:03:29] <decx> there's an iterationend event
[18:05:11] <decx> animationiteration that was it
[18:09:09] <lambdumb> oh, awesome
[18:11:24] <lambdumb> it should be trivial to change the state of an animation using a callback from that listener, right
[18:11:39] <decx> it's hell
[18:11:45] <decx> hf and good night
[18:11:46] <decx> :>
[18:13:02] <lambdumb> ?
[18:50:36] <pauled> decx: got it
[18:50:42] <pauled> decx: $("#blast")[0].play();
[18:51:25] <pauled> decx: thanks to internet and stackoverflow
[18:51:42] <pauled> :D
[19:10:52] <lambdumb> say i have an ajax call that fires every 6 seconds or so to get data, and then appends data to divs with specific IDs
[19:11:10] <lambdumb> is it more memory efficient to store the $('#selector') in a variable?
[19:11:44] <andrew9183> yes
[20:15:35] <lambdumb> i have an AJAX call on my page that gets some stuff, and a string of text chosen randomly, which is put into a container that's animated
[20:15:51] <lambdumb> this call happens every 6 seconds, and the animation of the container ends maybe every 10 seconds or so
[20:16:16] <lambdumb> is it more efficient to make a seperate AJAX call as a callback to the end of the animation, or keep it inside the call with the other data?
[20:40:45] <pauled> I have basically this: <audio autoplay></audio> but when I do this on console: if ($('audio').attr('autoplay') !== undefined) {console.log('attribute exists');} else {console.log('attribute does not exist');}
[20:41:06] <pauled> getting this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'attr' of null
[20:49:12] <pauled> why simple $('audio') doesn't work in chrome console
[20:49:33] <pauled> getting 'null'
[20:50:17] <pauled> oh I figured out why
[20:57:17] <tw2113> don't leave us hanging pauled
[20:57:55] <pauled> tw2113: that was because iframe in fiddle
[20:58:20] <tw2113> ahh
[20:58:31] <pauled> in console I have to select from top frame
[20:58:42] <pauled> to result
[21:00:46] <pauled> also $('audio').prop('autoplay') is the right way to check this attribute
[21:07:55] <user_corrupt> I have a jquery ui modal window (confirmation dialog) that I am invoking in the following function: http://pastie.org/10189633 and I am just trying to figure out how to add a text box to it… I need the input text to get passed into a variable upon submissions (line 38) Any suggestions much appreciated.
[21:16:45] <user_corrupt> do I need to add an html text input inside the content that I am loading into the modal window?
[21:37:09] <sigtau> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a function for callbacks to a really simple API service via $.ajax() but I can't seem to pass data out of the success function and I'm not sure how to do what I want.  Ideally I'd like to return the data as a return value for the callback function, but due to variable scope, it isn't really possible.
[21:37:17] <sigtau> I'm avoiding globals like the plague, so that's off the table.
[21:37:19] <sigtau> http://pastebin.com/yZG2dsPZ
[21:37:24] <sigtau> Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?
[21:37:30] <sigtau> (Code should be fairly self-explanatory)
[21:43:51] <sigtau> Wait, I am an idiot.
[21:43:59] <sigtau> This effectively makes an AJAX callback synchronous.
[21:44:11] <sigtau> Time to refactor. lol
[21:56:17] <user_corrupt> I have the following html content with form: http://pastie.org/10189684#49-50 being added to the following jquery ui modal dialog: http://pastie.org/10189683#38 and I’m just trying to figure out how to pass the contents of the text input into the variable called “postMessage”, when the form is submitted. Any suggestions?
[22:29:59] <pauled> user_corrupt: Not sure but maybe use .val()
[22:52:33] <spillere> on http://codepen.io/dansku/pen/aONMme, when I am on the 3rd lvl of the menu, how can I set the color of the 2nd lvl to white with jquery? ty!
[22:54:50] <user_corrupt> pauled: thanks man, trying some stuff now
