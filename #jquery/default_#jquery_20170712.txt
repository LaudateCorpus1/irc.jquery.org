[00:07:58] <pavonia> Braden`: What was your question?
[00:15:24] <Braden`> pavonia:  I already fixed it, thank you
[01:21:07] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/wweLkex6/ is it natural that serialize produces a string like this(see console)when the name attribute of the inputs have array notation?
[02:33:01] <Braden`> I have a result from my ajax call, and it is JSON.  It should just be a numerical value.  Perhaps I changed something, but it shouldn't be an array, JSON, XML, etc.  Is there anything I should look for?  My PHP results are always die(0); die(1); die(-1);  like that
[02:34:56] <Braden`> My dataType = false,
[02:37:22] <Cork> Braden`: note sure what it is you're asking
[02:39:37] <Braden`> When I am looking at the XHR result from my ajax query, the response is "JSON"
[02:39:43] <Braden`> It should be a string
[02:39:54] <Braden`> I have dataTye set as "text"
[02:41:00] <Cork> Braden`: dataType only sets what ajax should ask the server for
[02:41:18] <Cork> the content-type the server responds with is what controls the final result
[02:41:19] <Braden`> But the server, at least my php code does not return json
[02:41:33] <Cork> what you return doesn't matter
[02:41:38] <Cork> what you SAY you return does
[02:41:46] <Braden`> How do I control that?
[02:41:52] <Cork> the content-type header
[02:42:11] <Braden`> Thank you
[02:42:25] <Braden`> What would that be?  text/text or just text?
[02:42:37] <Cork> text/plain
[02:46:24] <Braden`> Ok, I set that using the PHP header() function.  On the ajax side, I am still getting "JSON" as the response.  I checked the headers for the XHR response, and I got "Content-type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8", so it /should/ be in plain text, but its still doing the JSON thing
[02:46:59] <Cork> Braden`: by json you mean data is an object?
[03:06:14] <Braden`> Cork:  It just says in the response "JSON"
[03:06:16] <Braden`> Not sure
[03:06:34] <Cork> what what is "response"?
[03:06:55] <Cork> you're extremely vague...
[03:19:32] <Braden`> Firefox XHR Response
[03:20:06] <Braden`> I apologize.  I am not trying to be vague.  I am just not sure what information to put forth.
[03:20:13] <Neo_3333> hi
[03:20:32] <Neo_3333> I create casino site where people will play in poker
[03:21:13] <Neo_3333> and I can't got connection to my server, I opened port 8087 and don't have access ??? http://178.94.99.239:8087/
[03:21:21] <Neo_3333> why I can't go to this url ?
[03:21:36] <Cork> Neo_3333: uh... and this is related to jquery cause?
[03:21:49] <Neo_3333> no
[03:21:57] <Neo_3333> but suddenly anyone know why ?
[03:22:11] <Neo_3333> on this I can connect http://127.0.0.1:8087/ , and on my real ip can't ???
[03:22:12] <Cork> Neo_3333: find a channel for the server software your running or something
[03:22:17] <Cork> it is offtopic for this channel
[03:22:21] <Neo_3333> ok
[03:22:39] <Neo_3333> Cork, you don't know why ?
[03:22:50] <Cork> why is the grass green
[03:23:02] <Neo_3333> don't know )
[03:23:04] <Cork> there is a ton of missing information to be able to answer that question...
[03:23:13] <Neo_3333> ok, clearly
[03:23:33] <Neo_3333> Cork, do you know casino site bring much money ?
[03:23:41] <Neo_3333> can bring much ?
[03:23:45] <Cork> (is it running locally, is the server running, is it the correct port...)
[03:23:51] <Cork> Neo_3333: i don't care
[03:24:35] <Neo_3333> yes in local com running , but if you open port it must be available using address my real ip with opened port
[03:24:55] <Cork> Neo_3333: i wasn't asking, again take it to a channel where the question is on topic, and that IS NOT HERE
[03:25:05] <Neo_3333> ok
[03:27:11] <Braden`> What about raw data from an ajax request?  Is it possible to access the raw data?
[03:28:42] <Cork> Braden`: you get the raw data in the response callback
[03:28:52] <Cork> Braden`: can you create a jsfiddle with the code you have problem with?
[03:30:19] <Braden`> Cork:  I can paste tomorrow.  Too tired tonight.  Going to bed soon.
[03:30:31] <Braden`> What do you mean callback.  Isn't the whole response a callback?
[03:31:28] <Cork> ... where you get the data from the callback?
[03:31:39] <Cork> opps sorry from the ajax call
[03:32:17] <Braden`> success: function(data) {
[03:38:07] <Braden`> Thanks Cork, I appreciate the assistance
[03:38:09] <Braden`> Goodnight
[04:22:31] <pheurton> Any reason why .serializeArray returns empty when I use a class selector instead of an element selector?
[04:23:03] <pheurton> if I use that selector without calling the function, it still returns all the elements I want
[04:25:58] <Cork> pheurton: serializeArray doesn't care what selector you uses
[04:26:05] <Cork> it works on the elements in the result set
[04:26:41] <pheurton> Cork: then why doesn't it serialize the result set I give it?
[04:26:58] <pheurton> It works when I use $('form')
[04:27:09] <Cork> pheurton: can you reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle?
[04:27:18] <pheurton> I'll have a go
[04:41:38] <pheurton> Cork: I can't even return any values with jsfiddle...
[04:41:40] <pheurton> https://jsfiddle.net/1Lz7af31/1/
[04:42:01] <pheurton> serializearray is undefined
[04:42:14] <pheurton> serializeArray*
[04:43:54] <Cork> pheurton: they don't have a name
[04:44:22] <Cork> pheurton: https://jsfiddle.net/1Lz7af31/2/
[04:48:33] <pheurton> Hmm sadly that's not the problem in my application... looks like I can't reproduce it
[04:48:36] <pheurton> thanks for the help
[04:49:38] <Cork> pheurton: serialize requires that the field has a name and isn't disabled
[04:49:50] <Cork> pheurton: if the selector returns the correct elements, and they have name
[04:49:56] <Cork> make sure they aren't disabled
[04:50:39] <pheurton> Cork: that's what it is! thank you
[04:50:41] <pheurton> they're disabled
[04:50:49] <pheurton> I still need their values though
[04:52:44] <Cork> pheurton: then you would have to not use disabled
[04:52:55] <Cork> readonly is an option for example
[04:55:05] <pheurton> Cork: thank you, readonly works fine :)
[04:57:22] <blinky_> Morning all.  I am wondering if anyone knows of an api that will allow me to provide a telephone number and it returns the name of the company for that number?
[04:57:55] <Cork> blinky_: that would be VERY dependent on country
[04:58:05] <blinky_> UK only
[06:19:03] <senaps> hi, ajax post method add's current url to the beginning of the url to post and fails to post correctly.
[06:20:56] <senaps> https://paste.ubuntu.com/25074513/
[06:36:19] <aways> Hi,
[06:36:26] <aways> Question about getSCript
[06:37:35] <aways> I need to call getScript to retrieve a file. But pb this file ins't a linear file to execute. But it's a prototype file and I need to call new on this
[06:38:09] <aways> $.getScript('url').done(function (x) { var t = new x() }));
[06:38:19] <aways> Any solution about this ?
[07:21:50] <Cork> aways: not really
[07:22:15] <Cork> aways: doesn't it declare a class name?
[07:23:01] <Cork> cause if it does then you just do var value = new constructorName();
[07:23:40] <aways> constructorName is not defined
[07:24:05] <Cork> well ya, cause you have to use the name from inside the resource your loading
[07:24:17] <aways> ?
[07:24:36] <Cork> javascript doesn't have files, it is just resources loaded into the scope
[07:25:10] <aways> Yes but i can call the constructor even on the same scope
[07:25:13] <Cork> so $.getScript(url-to-resource-with-myPlugin).done(function() { var plugin = myPlugin(); })
[07:25:21] <Cork> sure
[07:25:26] <Cork> you can call it from anywhere
[07:25:44] <Cork> case $.getScript runs eval on the data sent from the server
[07:26:01] <Cork> so what is declared inside the response becomes names in the global scope
[07:27:09] <aways> https://jsfiddle.net/pfhmdss1/
[07:27:28] <aways> Cork, this code doesn't works
[07:27:54] <aways> it's say A isn't defined
[07:27:59] <Cork> ya, sure as url doesn't give a 200 response so done is never called
[07:28:18] <aways> debugger stop
[07:28:35] <aways> I'am sure that done are triggerred
[07:31:21] <Cork> aways: https://jsfiddle.net/pfhmdss1/1/
[07:34:30] <aways> Cork, console is never "works" not triggerred
[07:34:38] <aways> arf
[07:34:41] <Cork> works fine here
[07:34:47] <aways> Nop
[07:34:50] <aways> Not for me
[07:35:07] <Cork> make sure you're not blocking network requests then
[07:35:17] <Cork> works fine in chromium and firefox here
[07:35:22] <aways> GET ok, but console.log() not displayed
[07:35:29] <Cork> it is here
[07:35:40] <Cork> so you have to debug your browser
[07:35:57] <aways> Ok with chrome
[07:36:00] <aways> it's ok
[07:36:13] <Cork> what isn't it fine with?
[07:36:28] <aways> FF
[07:36:37] <Cork> try in safe mode then
[07:36:43] <Cork> cause like i said works fine in firefox here
[07:36:54] <aways> Ok my bad i think :)
[07:37:10] <aways> I try this
[07:37:13] <aways> on the code
[07:37:46] <Cork> worth mentioning though, $.getScript uses eval so if you ever plan to use csp you can't use it
[07:38:06] <aways> csp ?
[07:38:31] <Cork> aways: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP
[07:38:46] <Cork> its enhanced security control the server can request from the browser
[07:39:27] <aways> Ok fine
[07:40:02] <aways> Uncaught ReferenceError: CallDetailRecords is not defined
[07:40:08] <aways> With the same code
[07:40:36] <Cork> and without any wrappers you have function CallDetailRecords in the resource you request?
[07:40:57] <Cork> meaning if you instead put it as a <script> tag in the head of the page it works?
[07:40:58] <aways> Yep but it's a prototype
[07:41:10] <Cork> a prototype?
[07:41:37] <aways> like first jsfiddle
[07:41:45] <Cork> prototype is shared properties on a constructor, you can't call it directly
[07:42:23] <aways> https://jsfiddle.net/pfhmdss1/2/
[07:42:30] <aways> this is it :)
[07:43:44] <Cork> that is a constructor not a prototype
[07:44:00] <Cork> and (function () { <--
[07:44:03] <Cork> it is scoped
[07:44:18] <aways> Yes but even without (function()
[07:44:34] <aways> I can't instanciate
[07:45:55] <aways> I don;t understand why in my case it's non working
[07:46:28] <aways> If js eval() the code the new is ok
[07:47:33] <Cork> aways: the difference is you can't take return values from the evaled code
[07:48:14] <aways> Yes but I don't need to return a value.
[07:48:21] <Cork> but ya... i would recommend just putting the script as a <script> tag in your html instead, much simpler
[07:49:05] <aways> Cork yes but my script tag are loaded by $.load() so all of this code aren't on global scope ...
[07:49:22] <aways> It's a html page include by jquery ...
[07:49:23] <Cork> ... lovely
[07:49:35] <aways> ... it's not my way ...
[07:49:37] <aways> :(
[07:58:03] <aways> Thanks Cork for your help :)
[07:58:26] <Cork> didn't really help much
[07:58:52] <aways> Yes but now i known that is't possible
[07:59:16] <aways> If i add script on the first loaded page is works
[07:59:45] <aways> How can use $.load on the global context
[08:34:44] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/dytg0nza/5/ , i get data:image/png (from memory cache) , is this normal? i'm trying to eliminate extra requests with lazyload
[08:47:44] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/1/ , what are those data:image/png (from memory cache)? i'm using lazyload and i'm trying to eliminate those requests
[09:26:54] <aways> Question about js How works module.exports = something
[09:27:15] <aways> So here variable exports take as value something ; But In node you can make this line for each module
[09:27:47] <aways> I think that a tricks is under to call method instead a variable
[09:27:56] <aways> But how ?
[09:28:40] <aways> if I write this : this is my idea
[09:28:42] <aways> https://jsfiddle.net/kw9hf158/
[09:37:28] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/pu4qqnrd/6/ ..look at the HTML the name attributes of the input have array notation with index starting at 0...how am I going to achieve so that by adding new inputs to the DOM(by clicking the plus icon) the subsequent inputs have their index incremented by one each time)
[09:42:15] <localh0st> dimi1947: https://jsfiddle.net/pu4qqnrd/7/
[09:44:58] <dimi1947> localh0st:it never occured to me that it would be so easy...
[09:45:41] <localh0st> just count the number of elements in DOM by it's selector
[09:53:30] <dimi1947> localh0st:my mind initially thpught a for loop...
[10:17:29] <momomo> hi, i am looking for nice css3 window change animations. like one window hides and another comes in.. couldn't find any proper term to search on. are there any nice websites that have some nice examples ready?
[10:17:56] <taplar> maybe try a css room?
[10:18:06] <TotallyNotKim> ay! Don't kill me, but is there a way to intercept all HTTP ajax requests and make them HTTPS?
[10:18:41] <taplar> i think there are plugins for that
[10:20:16] <taplar> for jQuery ajax requests, you could possibly use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/ to manipulate the url, dunno
[10:20:25] <taplar> for non-jQuery ajax requests, no clue
[10:21:51] <taplar> and when i say 'plugins for that' i mean browser plugins, not jQuery plugins
[10:25:24] <taplar> momomo: as far as the search term you are looking for, i believe what you are referring to are 'transitions'
[10:25:34] <TotallyNotKim> yeah, that wouldn't help :( I'm in the process of moving a http site to https. Backend is kinda old and generates hardcoded http ajax requests somewhere = Mixed Content. Backend dev is not here, so I was hoping I could overwrite that somehow
[10:26:34] <TotallyNotKim> folks told me about Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests;
[10:26:36] <TotallyNotKim> let's see
[10:26:50] <taplar> i'd probably advocate for digging in and finding where those ajax requests are coming from and update them
[10:27:53] <taplar> otherwise, depending upon your backend server, it may be possible to rewrite requests from http to https, but that would be on topic for whatever server you use
[10:45:12] <adv_> do lines 24-28 ok to you? http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/4/
[10:48:45] <taplar> looks fine
[10:50:13] <TViernion> hey guys.  I have a variable that is the id of an <li> that I want to remove.  Shouldn't $("li").remove(variable); work?
[10:50:41] <taplar> $('#'+ variable).remove()
[10:50:50] <localh0st> adv_: no
[10:50:52] <localh0st> var $this = $(this);
[10:51:05] <localh0st> you're overwriting the variable from line 12
[10:51:19] <taplar> no it's not
[10:51:31] <taplar> that $this is scoped to that function.  it doesn't affect the outer $this
[10:51:40] <localh0st> ah, kk
[10:51:53] <taplar> if there wasn't a var there, you'd be correct
[10:59:31] <adv_> hm
[11:00:08] <adv_> so i found out what is happening . the hammer in every image container is blocking the load of the page
[11:00:16] <adv_> is there a way to overcome this?
[11:00:33] <taplar> no clue what Hammer is, if it is a jQuery plugin at all
[11:08:37] <adv_> taplar, http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/8/
[11:08:42] <sigdk> my IE browser complains for syntax error on this line:    .then(response => {           seems it doesn't like the arrow
[11:08:46] <sigdk> is there a workaround?
[11:08:56] <adv_> line 3 doesn't get printed
[11:09:26] <taplar> sigdk: what version of IE?
[11:09:50] <sigdk> taplar, this is 11.0
[11:10:51] <taplar> http://caniuse.com/#search=%3D%3E
[11:11:05] <taplar> it's not supported
[11:11:26] <taplar> you'll have to use normal functions, or compile down to ES5
[11:11:58] <taplar> adv_: how do you make an 'appear' event happen?
[11:12:55] <adv_> taplar, not sure, i found that line from http://morr.github.io/appear.html
[11:13:33] <taplar> $('section h3').appear();
[11:13:44] <taplar> so it looks like they are calling a method that causes that event to happen
[11:13:47] <adv_> taplar, the idea is to wrap hammer around the thumbnail containers upon appearing , and not all at once like the commented out code does at line 38
[11:13:52] <taplar> from a first glance at that page
[11:14:27] <sigdk> taplar, does this ".then(response => {" map to simply to this:   ".then(function(response) {"    ?
[11:14:35] <taplar> yep
[11:16:11] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/9/ , based on https://github.com/morr/jquery.appear
[11:16:16] <adv_> taplar, still nothing
[11:17:01] <taplar> where are you calling appear on a thumbscruber?
[11:17:17] <TViernion> would someone mind looking at http://dev2.42iso.com/mms_angular/dev/test_tab.php for a minute?  under the home tab you can "add tab" which dynamically adds the tab. Under tabs 2 and higher there is a "close" button and it works on the initial tabs, but anything dynamically created it doesnt work for... any thoughts?
[11:17:48] <taplar> TViernion: i'm assuming you are doing a normal binding and not a delegate binding then
[11:18:05] <taplar> normal bindings only bind on element that exist in the DOM at that point in time.  it does not affect new elements created
[11:18:32] <adv_> taplar, see line 38 , trying to do this but instead of each i want to do it dynamically . it doesn't have to be done with appear. any ideas?
[11:18:48] <taplar> line 38 is commented out
[11:18:48] <TViernion> https://pastebin.com/KKpJ38Az
[11:19:28] <taplar> $('.btnRemove').click(function (e) { <-- that's a normal binding, which i just described the limitation of
[11:20:17] <taplar> $(selectorForParentElementThatOwnsAllTheButtons).on('click', '.btnRemove', function(e) { ... });
[11:20:23] <taplar> change it to that pattern
[11:20:50] <taplar> the first selector must be for a parent of all the existing/future buttons what exists on page load
[11:23:59] <TViernion> so the div that the buttons are in has a class of "action" should it have an ID maybe and use that?
[11:24:29] <taplar> it doesn't have to, but you could.  whatever way you get there, you just need to select the parent of the dynamic elements to delegate bind on
[11:25:25] <taplar> hold on, wait
[11:25:30] <sigdk> taplar, any workaround also for fetch() ?    seems that IE doesn't like that either. I thought these things were standard
[11:25:36] <adv_> taplar, yes commented out because it hogs the system
[11:25:42] <taplar> which div has the class 'action'?
[11:25:52] <TViernion> the container div that the buttons are in
[11:26:04] <taplar> are you creating them as part of the dynamic stuff?
[11:26:09] <TViernion> yes
[11:26:12] <taplar> no dude
[11:26:20] <taplar> you have to do it on something that is not dynamically created
[11:26:24] <taplar> that's the issue
[11:26:29] <TViernion> so you're saying whatever is static that is not dynamically created
[11:26:43] <taplar> yes, for instance you are appending to '.tab-content'
[11:26:45] <TViernion> so it would be .tab-content
[11:26:48] <taplar> boom
[11:27:15] <taplar> sigdk: fetch() ?
[11:27:15] <TViernion> ayup that did it
[11:27:39] <TViernion> that's an interesting issue there.  I'm assuming the only way around it is finding the last static thing?
[11:27:57] <taplar> not the only way, but the cleanest
[11:28:09] <TViernion> makes sense
[11:28:14] <taplar> using a delegate binding allows you to have a single binding, rather than making one for every element
[11:28:29] <taplar> and addresses the issue of dynamic content, like you ran into
[11:28:37] <sigdk> taplar, yeah, but I see this has nothing to do with jquery... :)
[11:28:45] <taplar> sigdk: ;)  read my mind
[11:28:47] <TViernion> indeed.. that fixes one issue.. much appreciated
[11:30:33] <TViernion> does anyone know if it's possible to use soethnig like session storage to hold layouts?
[11:30:48] <AwkwardCough> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/wb5hgnfd/ looks like appear is for when your object comes into view of it. Kinda merged your code and an example code to show that in console
[11:30:56] <taplar> what do you mean hold layouts?
[11:31:23] <adv_> AwkwardCough, yeah i don't want appear i think
[11:31:39] <AwkwardCough> Okie dokie
[11:31:51] <TViernion> you've seen the layouts im creating dynamically... im looking at how to keep that dynamic content if the page is refreshed.
[11:31:59] <adv_> AwkwardCough, i want to init dynamically instead of all at once
[11:32:02] <adv_> any ideas?
[11:32:21] <taplar> TViernion: sure i mean you can stick any text into session storage that you want
[11:32:45] <taplar> i forget if there is a storage limit, but if so it's probably pretty large
[11:33:40] <AwkwardCough> adv_: could you clarify what you mean by init? like you want the images to load before the hammer stuff?
[11:34:00] <TViernion> that's about the only way i can think of at this time to keep that content there in case the page is closed/refreshed manually... can you think of another way?
[11:34:28] <taplar> if you don't care if the user clears their cache to destroy it, that's a decent method
[11:35:31] <TViernion> well... there is the potential for them to do that.. and the biggest issue would be to have some form open that they made changes to or were creating when it crashed... but then again if that's the case they would just have to start over OR the original content would be reloaded
[11:35:37] <adv_> AwkwardCough, no, i want to apply hammer to every thumbscrubber. but i have 200 of those. when i do it with .each the browser blocks and becomes unresponsive. i'm looking for a way to apply it dynamically ? i have 2 ideas. a. when the element appears on the viewport b. on touchstart
[11:36:16] <TViernion> I could also probably store the "open" tabs on in some type of db based session that way when they open up again it could rebuild the array
[11:36:35] <taplar> sure
[11:36:48] <taplar> just depends on how critical saving their progress is
[11:38:07] <taplar> adv_: so hammer is the image slideshow thing, right?
[11:38:47] <adv_> taplar, hammer is slide gestures
[11:38:55] <adv_> swipe
[11:38:59] <taplar> gotcha
[11:39:24] <taplar> so, really, you only want to initialize the hammer on one of those guys if the user mousedown/touchstart right?
[11:39:38] <taplar> not all 200 automatically
[11:40:00] <taplar> if they only slide 2 of them, you did pointless work on 198 of them
[11:43:26] <AwkwardCough> adv_: should it be cycling endlessly on swiperight?
[11:43:38] <Braden`> Good morning!
[11:43:41] <Braden`> Cork:  Are you around?
[11:43:51] <adv_> AwkwardCough, yes
[11:43:55] <adv_> http://jsfiddle.net/bhvzdyok/4/
[11:44:15] <adv_> i just did this but it requires two swipes to work as expected
[11:44:32] <adv_> i guess 1st is to register it with hammer and 2nd to actually do the swipe effect
[11:46:07] <AwkwardCough> http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/10/
[11:47:19] <adv_> yours too
[11:47:33] <adv_> two swipes
[11:52:10] <adv_> AwkwardCough, :/
[11:52:20] <taplar> we're both looking at it
[11:52:32] <taplar> the issue is that the initialization of the hammer happens after the click starts
[11:52:40] <taplar> so the first swipe doesn't register
[11:52:56] <AwkwardCough> ^
[11:57:27] <adv_> taplar, ah
[11:58:22] <adv_> i would really prefer the touchstart method instead of initialiazing hammer when the element appears on the viewport
[11:58:47] <taplar> right, but you still have the double swipe issue with that
[12:03:22] <adv_> taplar, there are a lot of stackoverflow posts regarding how to init hammer on dynamic elements
[12:03:47] <adv_> i guess that's a similar thing to this case?
[12:13:30] <adv_> taplar, AwkwardCough any luck?
[12:14:03] <AwkwardCough> nope
[12:14:04] <AwkwardCough> jk
[12:14:05] <AwkwardCough> http://jsfiddle.net/u610nhrt/11/
[12:14:09] <taplar> he's mean, i know
[12:14:36] <AwkwardCough> we went back to using appear
[12:15:08] <AwkwardCough> but initilized it for the ones not scrolled in view on page load
[12:17:34] <adv_> AwkwardCough, so ou mean " initialiazing hammer when the element appears on the viewport"?
[12:17:36] <adv_> you*
[12:19:13] <robertmaxrees> adv_ what do you think that means?
[12:19:18] <adv_> but this would mean that it reinits on the same element, no?
[12:26:35] <adv_> AwkwardCough, do i wrap that js in a document.ready?
[12:26:37] <AwkwardCough> adv_: yes but line 6 solves that. We put a check in there to only create the hammer once if it hasnt been created
[12:34:05] <taplar_lunch> it's always interesting to be standing in the food line and hear new trainees talking about their experiences with git
[12:34:27] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> especially when they don't yet really *understand* it
[12:34:49] <taplar_lunch> ya
[12:35:53] <robertmaxrees> had a dude recently tell me that he wanted to be able to change git history by squashing commits from months ago and stuff to make it "Cleaner"
[12:36:04] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:36:05] <robertmaxrees> it was a really weird hangup.
[12:36:16] <robertmaxrees> then i found out that he'd never used any source control and it clicked.
[12:36:32] <taplar_lunch> i know people who still leave commented code 'just incase' they need it later
[12:36:41] <robertmaxrees> ffffffff
[12:36:45] <taplar_lunch> :)
[12:36:50] <robertmaxrees> we reject that stuff in code review.
[12:53:36] <adv_> AwkwardCough, taplar_lunch fantastic!! thanks a lot!!
[12:54:39] <AwkwardCough> np glad to help
[12:55:19] <taplar_lunch> fwiw, AC let out an evil chuckle when he saw it worked on his phone
[12:55:22] <taplar_lunch> i was surprised
[13:01:31] <Braden`> Greetings!
[13:02:30] <taplar_lunch> aloha
[13:02:42] <Braden`> https://jsfiddle.net/Braden1/xhazppac/ <-- I am getting JSON as an XHR response instead of a "0" like I am expecting in text/plain format.  If I look at the raw response, it is "0".  If anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it.
[13:04:02] <taplar_lunch> what are you seeing that you are calling JSON?
[13:04:46] <Braden`> I am not calling JSON
[13:04:57] <taplar_lunch> 'I am getting JSON as an XHR response instead of a "0"'
[13:05:04] <Braden`> Its just appearing in my Firefox Developer XHR Response
[13:05:23] <Braden`> On the response tab, it simply says "JSON"
[13:05:36] <taplar_lunch> what does the raw response look like?
[13:13:29] * taplar dances
[13:17:51] <Braden`> taplar:  raw response is "0"   (which is what its supposed to be)
[13:18:40] <taplar> ok, so it's not json
[13:18:51] <taplar> what's the issue?
[13:26:42] <catbadger> I is back
[13:28:12] <Braden`> None I guess
[13:28:15] <Braden`> Thank you Taplar
[13:28:44] <catbadger> man if Taplar had a dollar for every time someone thanked.. :)
[13:29:24] <taplar> my 401k would be a 4.01k
[13:36:56] <catbadger> lol

[13:50:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:01:06] <taplar> react =/= jquery .... ?
[14:02:15] <robertmaxrees> i think it was an attempt to advertise his component
[14:03:55] <taplar> find a bar man
[14:05:10] <robertmaxrees> bingo
[14:31:12] <Es0teric> anyone know why i get this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : on this -> https://kopy.io/WjILj#line-13
[14:34:31] <taplar> api_data
[14:34:41] <taplar> you are doing [] instead of {}
[14:36:35] <Es0teric> oh snap whoops lol
[14:36:37] <Es0teric> thanks
[16:17:45] <jsnewb001> I've got an ajax call that is running and then appending the data to a container.  I'm trying to run a command after the appending has finished to make two divs the same size.
[16:18:09] <catbadger> fiddle?
[16:18:29] <jsnewb001> putting it up now.
[16:18:34] <catbadger> k
[16:25:18] <jsnewb001> catbadger: https://kopy.io/Cwhpd#aFID69ePvxM8IT
[16:26:19] <robertmaxrees> jsnewb001 i'm guessing $(this) isn't what you're expecting.
[16:26:44] * taplar cries
[16:26:49] <taplar> '$(this)[0]' ...... why?
[16:26:52] <jsnewb001> My height is coming out to be 1117 but it need to be around3817
[16:27:02] <catbadger> why?
[16:27:03] <taplar> just....... why?
[16:27:17] <robertmaxrees> jsnewb001 wat
[16:27:29] <jsnewb001> Cuz I don't know js very well and I'm teaching myself right now.
[16:27:53] <taplar> $(this) <-- hey, make a jquery object.  $(this)[0] <-- hey, lets break out of the object we just made
[16:27:57] <Kartagis> taplar: because $(this) is an array
[16:28:04] <taplar> .....
[16:28:05] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is not an array
[16:28:14] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.  array-like sorta.
[16:28:18] <catbadger> yup
[16:28:24] <Kartagis> [0] implies it is, no?
[16:28:29] <taplar> no
[16:28:42] <taplar> $(document.body)[0] === document.body
[16:28:53] * catbadger shudders
[16:29:15] <catbadger> jsnewb001 there's a few problems with what you're doing. what are you trying to get the height of?
[16:29:53] <jsnewb001> Main content page which is loaded by the getPosts function and then my sidebar.  I want to make sure they are equal heights.
[16:30:11] <catbadger> ok, then you want $(body).height();
[16:30:25] <catbadger> or some other selector... $(this) is just the wrong thing
[16:30:27] <catbadger> ;)_
[16:30:48] <taplar> pass in 'post' to your each
[16:30:51] <taplar> or something.  use that
[16:30:54] <catbadger> ^
[16:31:01] <robertmaxrees> also: why done AND complete?
[16:31:05] <taplar> ^
[16:31:06] <jsnewb001> Okay.  My sidebar and content area have the same class applied to them so I can find each one of their heights.
[16:31:07] <robertmaxrees> WHy not just .then()?
[16:31:35] <jsnewb001> Cuz my page height wasn't adjusting so I was just trying anything I could find via google.
[16:32:21] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:32:45] <taplar> fwiw, you can do that with css
[16:33:01] <taplar> display table/row/cell funzies
[16:33:51] <jsnewb001> Yeah.  I'm supporting a legacy project that I inherited.  Was just trying to do this quickly without having to modify the css and break everything.
[16:35:58] <jsnewb001> I'm just going to head back over to google
[16:36:29] <taplar> did you see robertmaxrees's questions?
[16:37:25] <jsnewb001> The part about then() ?
[16:37:36] <taplar> yup
[16:37:54] <taplar> or just a done
[16:37:58] <jsnewb001> I didn't use then because I didn't know about it.  Everything I pulled up on google showed done() so I used it.
[16:38:17] <taplar> so why have a done and a complete?
[16:38:50] <jsnewb001> Cuz up until now I didn't know not to.  Like I said, I'm new, this is only my second time to mess with js.
[16:39:39] <taplar> which is fine.  we're asking to see if you may have some misconceptions that we should correct.  don't think we are trying to be offensive.
[16:40:16] <jsnewb001> Okay.
[16:40:30] <taplar> so first, try merging your complete logic into your done
[16:40:35] <taplar> see what you get
[16:41:46] <jsnewb001> I tried that the first time and still got the wrong output.  Thats when I put it into two separate items.
[16:42:22] <taplar> can you show us what your done only logic looked like?
[16:44:02] <hassoon> guys i need really some help, anyone who knows of some plugin that transforms a file input element into a drag and drop file upload zone ? i just need it in that way, so later files get submitted with the form element without any ajax work
[16:44:10] <hassoon> i've been searching already
[16:45:07] <robertmaxrees> hassoon have you found anything that gets close at least?
[16:46:19] <jsnewb001> taplar https://kopy.io/N9Z9A#GSnUtzY0t9oIPP
[16:47:10] <taplar> ok, so with this version, what is the issue?
[16:48:58] <taplar> or better yet, describe what this -should- be doing
[16:49:08] <jsnewb001> My height is reading 1117 when it should actually be 3817.  It's reading the height before the data is appended to the content area.
[16:49:29] <taplar> how many times do you see the value of highest box printed out?
[16:49:57] <jsnewb001> I want the ajax to run and populate all the data on the #content area.  Then i want to look at #sidebar & #content and see which has a higher height and then give both of them that height.
[16:49:58] <hassoon> robertmaxrees: currently this, but i'm still failing to make it display all of the selected files' names,  https://github.com/jaysalvat/ezdz
[16:50:07] <jsnewb001> 2
[16:50:15] <taplar> what are the values printed?
[16:50:36] <jsnewb001> 1117 and 1117
[16:52:49] <taplar> so you are saying that one of the eqPHeight is 3817?
[16:53:08] <jsnewb001> it should be with the current number of results.
[16:53:14] <taplar> but is it?
[16:53:59] <jsnewb001> No.  That's what's making me assume that it read the #content as height 0 and the #sidebar as 1117 and then applied that height to both.
[16:54:16] <taplar> have you verified that?
[16:54:37] <jsnewb001> I don't know how to.
[16:54:56] <taplar> before line 21, console log the height
[16:55:09] <taplar> comment out line 26
[16:55:48] <taplar> when you want to verify things, log them, or place a debugger statement so you can look around
[16:56:20] <taplar> a debugger statement being: debugger;
[16:56:42] <taplar> which will cause the browser to pause execution and you can look at things in your developer tools
[16:57:45] <jsnewb001> That reported 1117 3x's
[16:58:16] <taplar> so you got three eqPHeight that are each 1117 in height
[16:58:44] <jsnewb001> Yes.  There are 2 console logs.  One of which runs twice.
[16:59:09] <taplar> oh
[16:59:20] <taplar> so two 1117s
[16:59:24] <jsnewb001> yes
[16:59:34] <taplar> and you did comment out the line that sets the height?
[17:00:06] <jsnewb001> Yes
[17:00:28] <taplar> so then it is accurate that the max height is 1117
[17:01:18] <jsnewb001> But I don't see how when I adjust the height of one of them to 3817 it doesn't run over and into my footer like it currently is.
[17:02:29] <taplar> i'd have to see a working example of the issue.  just from looking at the logic, i can't tell much more
[17:03:21] <jsnewb001> Okay.  I wish I could put up a working copy but my sysadmin won't allow any of the code to go out.
[17:06:27] <taplar> it doesn't need to be the whole thing.  i'm just needing more context into the markup.  all i can tell from this logic is that you are appending to a #myDiv, and some where you have row-eq-height with eqPHeight in them.
[17:06:40] <taplar> not much context into how that relates to the menu/body
[17:06:59] <taplar> cause you are getting 3817 from some where.  i just don't know where
[17:10:59] <jsnewb001> taplar https://jsfiddle.net/zgr42Lwj/
[17:11:39] <taplar> ah, ok
[17:11:41] <jsnewb001> I'm manually figuring up how tall the actual div containing my ajax data is.
[17:11:56] <catbadger> $('id').height()
[17:12:03] <catbadger> ...
[17:12:12] <taplar> and you don't have any css overflow set on the eqPHeight, right?
[17:12:20] <jsnewb001> No
[17:12:50] <taplar> what about margins, padding, borders?
[17:13:09] <jsnewb001> There is a 15px padding all around
[17:16:34] <taplar> should 'posts' be 'myDiv' ?
[17:17:08] <taplar> or vise versa?
[17:18:12] <jsnewb001> Got it to work now.
[17:18:25] <taplar> ?
[17:18:50] <jsnewb001> https://jsfiddle.net/zgr42Lwj/1/
[17:19:05] <jsnewb001> I used what catbadger had said
[17:21:58] <taplar> ok
[17:22:19] <jsnewb001> Thanks for the help taplar
[17:22:31] <taplar> sure
[19:06:57] <orbyt_> How could I receive a callback when a .submit() function completes?
[19:07:11] <orbyt_> The selected answer here is no longer valid: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11534690/how-to-do-a-jquery-callback-after-form-submit
[19:19:37] <robertmaxrees> orbyt_ are you using ajax?
[19:21:59] <orbyt_> I'm not actually handling the submit, it seems to be handled by a third party. The only code I have access to is a `$form.submit()l`
[19:22:15] <orbyt_> `$form.submit();`*
[19:22:53] <robertmaxrees> this a particular plugin or something?
[19:23:24] <orbyt_> Hubspot thing
[19:23:55] <robertmaxrees> the issue is you don't really have the ability to add a handler outside of the binding with some small exceptions.
[19:24:30] <robertmaxrees> well, unless you use a global ajax event handler.
[19:25:29] <orbyt_> Yea, but those can only be attached to document
[19:25:49] <orbyt_> And frankly this isn't important enough for getting to hacky about it
[19:25:54] <robertmaxrees> right.  you'd have to look at the url that it was for.
[19:26:29] <orbyt_> Was hoping I could've just done something like .submit((err, res), {}) or something haha
[19:26:36] <orbyt_> Hmm
[19:27:07] <robertmaxrees> newp.  not if you're triggering.
[19:27:28] <orbyt_> Welp, so be it. Thanks robertmaxrees
[20:14:59] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that uses datatables and the editor?
