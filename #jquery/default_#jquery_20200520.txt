[15:31:22] <kittonian> hi all. I am using the loadMoreResults.js script and have it working perfectly except for one situation. On a mobile device if I load the page it works fine. If I rotate the device and reload the page it works fine. However, if I rotate the device and do not reload, it loads multiple load more buttons. I've tried basing an if/else off a css query but no matter what I've tried I can't seem to get it to work. Here's my current code https://bpa.st/ON2A

[19:03:43] <jiffe> anyone know any good drag and drop plugins that would let me drag a card from a set of cards into a container but leave the original card in place and only allow one instance of the card in the dropped container?
[19:04:01] <jiffe> I see a lot of drag and drop containers that move from one set to the other
