[00:08:46] <Whirl3d> any suggestions for a good align plugin. I have written my own several times, but thought maybe there's something more robust out there.
[00:13:07] <kakarlus> tnx very much bot-t Cork Whirl3d :D
[00:31:34] <marekw2143> hi, there's html code like: <h3/><div id="one"><button id="btn"/></div><h3/><div id="two">Some content</div> and JS code: $("#two").hide();
[00:32:02] <marekw2143> $("#btn").click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide().next("div").show() but then div with id="two" isn' tshown
[00:32:32] <marekw2143> but calling: $(this).parent().hide().next().next().show() shows div#two
[00:32:45] <marekw2143> why ?
[00:40:53] <unknown_had> how i may get if of the image over which the user has clicked. There are more then 1 images and i have to get the id/name of image over which the user clicked.
[00:41:06] <unknown_had> s/if/id
[00:48:04] <takkun1946> unknown_had: in your click function def, make sure pass in the event (as evt maybe) and then do something similar to e=evt||window.event; var _id = $(e.target).attr('id');
[00:49:27] <takkun1946> unknown_had: your click assignment might look like $(foo).click(function(evt){ ... });
[00:49:48] <unknown_had> takkun1946, cool, let me to try this.
[00:53:15] <Pupeno_W> Is there any templating language anyone can recommend to use in javascript (with or without query)?
[00:55:47] <marekw2143> Pupeno_W: there's plugin for jQuery called like "jquery template"
[00:56:34] <Pupeno_W> marekw2143: yeah, but it says: Note: The jQuery team has decided not to take this plugin past beta. It is no longer being actively developed or maintained. The docs remain here for the time being (for reference) until a suitable replacement template plugin is ready.
[00:56:35] <takkun1946> there's also
[00:56:52] <takkun1946> there's also Backbone.js underscore.js and pure.js
[00:57:38] <marekw2143> Pupeno_W: currently I'm developing with django templates
[01:06:23] <donnax> hey i'm having trouble with focus() on firefox doesnt seem to work
[01:07:08] <donnax> is there any specific bug i should be aware of?
[01:07:55] <Cork> donnax: you need to be more specific then that
[01:08:09] <Cork> a demo for example
[01:08:11] <Cork> ?.demo
[01:08:12] <bot-t> Cork, #10330 (conflict with prototype.js) – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - Opened 6 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10330
[01:08:19] <Cork> bah
[01:08:22] <Cork> ?demo
[01:08:22] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[01:08:47] <donnax> hmm i cant really cause i'm coding a userscript
[01:08:54] <donnax> for greasemonkey
[01:15:15] <gravadlax> Hi all. Is anybody aware of a possible bug in datepicker.parseDate for dates in the far past? When converting to a long, I get a 1 hour difference with Java
[01:15:49] <gravadlax> Bug tracker is down at the time, and didn't find any related issue on bing
[01:16:53] <gravadlax> It happens for dates before the 1970 or 1960's, somewhere :)
[01:19:21] <raj> can I check if $(e).is('mouseclick') ?
[01:19:41] <Cork> raj e.type
[01:19:50] <Cork> e isn't an element so no need for $(e)
[01:20:00] <raj> ok
[01:21:33] <raj> Cork, what if I require mousedown and mouseover?
[01:21:54] <Cork> those will be the type, or what do you mean?
[01:22:08] <raj> so if(e.mousedown&&e.mouseover){ somefunc()}
[01:22:14] <Cork> no
[01:22:17] <raj> i mean e.type
[01:22:18] <raj> sorry
[01:22:22] <Cork> type is a text string
[01:22:43] <Cork> (e.type === 'mousedown' || e.type === 'mouseup')
[01:23:03] <Cork> you can't have mouseup and down at the same time
[01:25:17] <raj> right, but even if mousedown was done earlier, will it still be true as long as it wasn't released?
[01:26:52] <Cork> raj: no
[01:27:09] <Cork> e.type is the name of the currently triggered event
[01:27:28] <Cork> raj: if you want to know if an event has happend you need to track that your self
[01:28:52] <raj> k
[01:28:56] <raj> understood
[01:28:57] <raj> thanks
[01:33:55] <Flo0815> good morning
[01:33:57] <Flo0815> guys
[01:37:45] <Flo0815> how do i get the first element with a certain css-class?
[01:38:36] <Cork> Flo0815: you mean the first child element of an element with a specific class?
[01:38:58] <Flo0815> yep
[01:39:03] <Cork> $('.my-class > :first')
[01:39:33] <Flo0815> is it also possible to $('#wrapper .myclass >:first)?
[01:40:00] <Cork> sure
[01:40:05] <Flo0815> thx
[01:40:30] <Cork> remember though that there can be any number of levels between #wrapper and .myclass
[01:42:39] <takkun1946> Flo0815: you want the first child that is using the .myclass, not the first child of a node that uses .myclass?
[01:43:05] <takkun1946> $('.my-class > :first') will get you the first child of a node that uses .myclass
[01:43:31] <Cork> takkun1946: <Cork> Flo0815: you mean the first child element of an element with a specific class? | <Flo0815> yep
[01:43:32] <dsdeiz> hi! how do i check if an image has already finished loading?
[01:43:33] <takkun1946> $('#wrapper > .my-class:first') will get you the first child using .myclass
[01:43:53] <Erik__> Hello averyone, I have a problem I located to fancybox 1.3.4 in ie 8. Basicly the hole site lockes down while loading the scripts. This is the address : http://141.255.184.120
[01:44:26] <Erik__> My question is if there is something anyone can think of doing to get around this
[01:44:51] <takkun1946> Cork: sorry... been a long day, missed that one
[01:45:01] <Erik__> I tried to load it asynchronously
[01:45:52] <takkun1946> Erik__: are your scripts being added in the header or the footer???
[01:45:59] <Erik__> header
[01:46:08] <takkun1946> yeah, don't do that
[01:46:20] <Cork> dsdeiz: you can't
[01:46:27] <takkun1946> if you can, move them to the footer and do something like <script defer...
[01:46:41] <Erik__> defer ?
[01:46:46] <Cork> dsdeiz: you need to bind the listner before you load the image
[01:46:48] <takkun1946> but then, you may also have something wrong in the scripts themselves
[01:46:49] <Erik__> pls laborate.. never seen that before
[01:47:09] <Erik__> Well no errors or warnings
[01:47:14] <takkun1946> http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_script_defer.asp
[01:47:17] <dsdeiz> Cork: like using .load()?
[01:47:33] <Cork> dsdeiz: yes
[01:47:59] <Erik__> ok I try it
[01:48:07] <Erik__> I use document ready ..
[01:48:08] <takkun1946> Erik__: it's an attribute that _should_ defer the loading of the script to last thing
[01:48:18] <Erik__> aiight
[01:48:20] <Erik__> thanks
[01:48:24] <takkun1946> ic
[01:48:31] <takkun1946> so you're attaching them dynamically?
[01:48:59] <takkun1946> because that's 2 different things you're talking about, it would seem
[01:49:49] <takkun1946> $(document).ready is usually done in a js file... i'm referring to your .html page, <script defer src="some-url"></script>
[01:50:21] <Flo0815> Cork: problem with the :first-selector: in this structure: <div id="wrapper"><div id="subwrapper_1"><div id="animate_0"></div><div id="animate_2"></div></div> how do i get the first "animate_" element?
[01:50:57] <Flo0815> there can be multiple subwrapper in multiple layers
[01:51:02] <Cork> $('#subwrapper_1, :first')
[01:51:14] <Flo0815> i only know the wrapper-id
[01:51:24] <Erik__> takkun1946: Well the code looks like this right now: http://pastebin.com/h7wrfU5E
[01:51:35] <Cork> $('#subwrapper_1 :first :first') then
[01:51:39] <Cork> opps
[01:51:43] <Erik__> But I see what u mean .. I get on it
[01:51:56] <Cork> Flo0815: $('#wrapper :first :first') then
[01:52:03] <Cork> hmm
[01:52:08] <Cork> no that might not work either
[01:52:16] <Cork> Flo0815: $('#wrapper > :first > :first') then
[01:52:17] <Flo0815> Cork: but sometimes there is another wrapper-like div inside the subwrap
[01:52:25] <Cork> ...
[01:52:27] <dsdeiz> how do i do this? $('.foo').click(function() { $('.bar').load(function() { $([what to use here to select .foo]).baz(); }) })
[01:52:32] <Cork> Flo0815: you should really add a class to those elements
[01:52:38] <Flo0815> hm k
[01:52:54] <Flo0815> and then wrapper myclass > :first?
[01:53:03] <Cork> dsdeiz: $(this).find('.foo').baz()
[01:53:19] <Cork> Flo0815: if you add the class to animate you don't need to
[01:53:20] <juho3> When I drag an element onto the grid from the menu on the site, and hover it rotate & delete buttons pop up. How do I get them to only pop up in the element that's dragged onto the grid, not also the one in the menu
[01:53:24] <juho3> http://haaveri.org/~juho3/test/
[01:53:35] <dsdeiz> oh .bar is inside .foo
[01:53:36] <juho3> it now refers to .rotbutton -class, so ofcourse all of them fade in
[01:53:49] <juho3> But i'd like them to only pop up in the element that's hovered
[01:53:58] <takkun1946> Erik__: if you have that inline at the top of your page, then yes, that can take some time to load depending on what's inbetween you and those JS files
[01:54:45] <juho3> Please someone check that out, I'm quite sure it's a simple thing to fix
[01:55:29] <ussher_> I have a select dropdown with a few options (for categories)  I want to put a link next to the dropdown with "add new category" and when clicked the select gets swapped out and replaced by a text input.  Is there a standard/easy way to do this?
[01:55:51] <takkun1946> Erik__: is there a reason you're doing a .getScript() and not <script src=...??
[01:56:31] <dgx> How do I fix this issue: Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html. I am using the jQuery lightbox plugin.
[01:56:48] <Erik__> I tryed the <script src= approch first, That made the site load in the way I try to fix.. This Is just me trying to fix it
[01:56:59] <Erik__> @takkun1946
[01:57:10] <Cork> dgx: fix your server to send the correct mimetype for the image
[01:58:00] <takkun1946> Erik__: understood, was just curious to your methods. no judgements
[01:58:30] <Erik__> takkun1946: np, just trying anything I can to fix it
[01:59:19] <dgx> Cork: It has the mime type : gif=>image/gif
[02:00:02] <Cork> dgx: thats not what your error message says
[02:01:47] <dgx> I think I found it, let me check.
[02:03:50] <Erik__> takkun1946: Ok .. I got it up in the footer now with the defer attribut.. still same thing though
[02:03:59] <Erik__> Any other ideÃ©s?
[02:04:23] <Erik__> I was thinking on trying the v.2 and hope for it to be fixed in there
[02:04:51] <MacroMan> I've written some code to wrap each letter on the contents in it's own span, but it doesn't work. Can someone take a look and let me know what I'm doing wrong please? http://jsfiddle.net/UrbMz/1/
[02:04:55] <ravenzz> morning
[02:04:57] <Erik__> Now I have a similer problem with the nivo slider.. but it dosent slow it down as much
[02:06:52] <recardo> hi #jquery
[02:07:49] <recardo> I am having difficulty positioning an iframe on the page
[02:08:08] <ussher_> MacroMan: is this what you want ? http://jsfiddle.net/UrbMz/1/
[02:08:33] <recardo> I've been advised "One of the features of jQuery is by default it doesn't operate on dynamic elements but only static elements that were there when the page was loaded.  This is for performance reasons.  If you're modifying the DOM after first load up, registered element event handlers will disconnect.  jQuery provides the "live" function for this to work with the "live" DOM"
[02:08:34] <ussher_> MacroMan: sorry http://jsfiddle.net/UrbMz/2/
[02:09:07] <recardo> I could really use some help :)
[02:09:52] <recardo> I've put the code up http://jsfiddle.net/5cbrd/
[02:10:04] <MacroMan> ussher_: Thanks, but looking at the DOM inspector, it doesn't look like it's worked
[02:10:24] <takkun1946> Erik__: this is for the "Elga" site??
[02:10:36] <Erik__> takkun1946: yes
[02:10:39] <takkun1946> seems to be loading fine on my side. am I missing something?
[02:10:46] <dgx> Cork: I have fixed the path, that was the problem, now when I click on an image, it hangs on the loading gif. Ideas?
[02:10:50] <Erik__> ie8?
[02:10:58] <takkun1946> oh, right...
[02:11:08] <takkun1946> old habit
[02:11:18] <Angelos_> hi there, I have a problem with my site, it's all described here, http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?841413-jQuery-on-website-not-working-but-working-externally&p=5088534#post5088534
[02:11:26] <Erik__> it loads perfectly in ie 9 and all others.. just lt8
[02:12:34] <Angelos_> my jQuery won't load :( and I am not sure what the issue is. I tried no conflict, but it still does not work.
[02:12:37] <MacroMan> ussher_: Your code gives the error: "Object #<Text> has no method 'val'"
[02:13:05] <recardo> This is the HotUKDeals script widget I'm trying to place on my product page
[02:13:40] <NoReGreT> in .prev(selector), what's the use of selector ? will it go prev() till it matches the selector ?
[02:14:18] <recardo> the .css() is ignored and I don't understand it. When I use Chrome 'Console' window and enter the line of code it works
[02:14:20] <Erik__> All webdevelopers in the world should go together and sue the fuckers at microsoft for prohibiting progress in the web industry..!!
[02:14:38] <Cork> NoReGreT: it will return the prev element if the selector matches
[02:14:52] <Cork> NoReGreT: if it doens't match it return an empty selector
[02:15:13] <Cork> ?.prevAll @ NoReGreT
[02:15:13] <bot-t> NoReGreT, .prevAll([selector]): Get all preceding siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prevAll/
[02:15:48] <raj> how can I select an `a` element with class 'hello'? $("a.hello") doesn't work, and neither does $(".hello a")
[02:15:53] <raj> the class is on the `a` element
[02:15:56] <takkun1946> Erik__: i see the issue you're seeing. it's fine after it caches obviously. have you pull each script out to see which one is taking the longest to load?
[02:16:46] <takkun1946> i'm almost certain it's the nivo slider. the company i currently work for uses it and it's a big suck on performance
[02:16:47] <Cork> raj: $("a.hello") should work
[02:16:59] <raj> i'm getting unexpected identifier
[02:17:18] <Cork> raj: not from that selector
[02:17:32] <Cork> make sure you don't have something else in a variable your not expecting
[02:18:12] <recardo> anyone
[02:18:15] <recardo> ? :)
[02:18:16] <bot-t> :)
[02:18:54] <Cork> recardo: make sure the element your working on is in the dom when your trying to find it
[02:19:27] <raj> Cork, you're right, it was from the .html(nothavingquotes)
[02:20:42] <recardo> Hi Cork, sorry for the sounds of desperation. I am under pressure to get this live today though.
[02:20:43] <recardo> :)
[02:20:44] <raj> Cork, can i toggle btwn two .html()'s for a click() function callback?
[02:20:51] <raj> i'm already toggling a div
[02:21:01] <recardo> How can I do that Cork?
[02:21:07] <Cork> raj: btwn?
[02:21:55] <Cork> between?
[02:22:15] <raj> Cork, $('a.greeting').toggle($(this).html('Hello'), $(this).html('Goodbye'))
[02:22:31] <raj> with a function(){} in there
[02:22:39] <Cork> sure
[02:22:50] <Cork> with the anonymus functions it should work
[02:22:55] <raj> seriously? that's valid?
[02:22:59] <raj> omg, i really love jquery
[02:23:19] <Cork> $('a.greeting').toggle(function() { $(this).html('Hello') }, function() {$(this).html('Goodbye') }) is valid yes
[02:23:43] <Cork> raj: though a better option is prob to have two elements in the dom and showing hiding them with a class instead
[02:24:03] <beepbeep_> I have a form with multiple submits. Depending on what submit is pressed, i want the target to be _blank. Any ideas?
[02:25:16] <sorush20> hi can someone help me sort out the problem on this page www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres the login page doesn't popup.
[02:26:30] <raj> Cork, why's that better?
[02:27:06] <AdvoWork> I'm having a weird problem with something, i'm calling a function twice(in a loop) and I do a post request. Before I do it, i alert, inside the post request I alert and after the post request I alert. I'm expecting it to do: Before, In, After, Before, In, After. Its actually doing: Before After Before After In In. Any ideas please, small code sample: http://pastebin.com/sPCzQs8W
[02:27:20] <sorush20_> hi can someone help me sort out the problem on this page www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres the login page doesn't popup.
[02:27:25] <Cork> raj: it makes it easier to handle the text cause its local to the rest of the text instead of somewhere in a script
[02:27:45] <takkun1946> beepbeep_: you would want to see which event target made the call in your click handler and set the form attr accordingly
[02:27:50] <Slydder> morning all.
[02:28:04] <sorush20_> morning Slydder
[02:28:06] <raj> Cork, hm, k
[02:28:07] <Cork> sorush20: [10:26:24.578] el.addEvent is not a function @ http://www.sorushnazari.com/tiempolatinolondres/index.php/en/:63
[02:28:08] <Erik__> takkun1946: I am sure its both of them.. but mainly fancybox. I have located a new possibility that I will try now.. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6050269/fancybox-causing-slow-load-times-in-ie
[02:28:17] <raj> in fact, toggle() with the two functions isn't working
[02:28:46] <Cork> raj: it should
[02:28:51] <Cork> ?.toggle
[02:28:51] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[02:28:56] <raj> wait
[02:28:57] <raj> i'm sorry
[02:28:58] <raj> it is
[02:29:00] <raj> had a typo
[02:29:23] <recardo> ?.live
[02:29:24] <bot-t> .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[02:30:31] <raj> Cork, it only changes once
[02:31:05] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: $.post() is async:true by default, so you will perform your alerts while the post happens in the background. the page will not "lock" and wait to complete the post before continuing
[02:31:25] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: try $.ajaxSetup({async:false}); prior to $.post()
[02:31:36] <takkun1946> you should get the expected results
[02:31:56] <sorush20> Cork: in the soruce in like 63 is the header for a script
[02:32:20] <bobuy> hi, i've a strange problem: setting the value attribute on input, types 'hidden' and 'text'. However it seems to work for types 'button', 'submit'. any ideas?
[02:32:48] <Cork> sorush20: well check you have error in your code, you need to locate that addEvent
[02:32:59] <Cork> *well you have error
[02:33:30] <Cork> raj: not sure why that would happen
[02:33:59] <raj> Cork, I'm just doing a little if statement with an x that will be either 0 or 1
[02:33:59] <takkun1946> bobuy: code snippet?
[02:34:05] <recardo> *waves* @ Cork
[02:34:08] <raj> not sure if there's a technical name for that `x`
[02:34:12] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, thanks, that seemed to work fine. Do i have to set it back to false afterwards so other functions/posts work as normal?
[02:34:30] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: yup
[02:34:42] <takkun1946> it's a global change
[02:35:00] <bobuy> alert('<input type="hidden" value="testing"/>');
[02:35:00] <bobuy> alert('<input type="button" name="cancel" value="Cancel">');
[02:35:13] <Slydder> am trying to get a event.preventDefault working. it does work as long as nothing is called prior to it in the function. the problem is that i am using it with jquery.post to prevent default values and need to iterate through checkboxes (array) and add them correctly before passing them through jquery.post. here is the code http://pastie.org/3640381
[02:35:14] <beepbeep_> takkun1946: thx, did that :)
[02:35:36] <bobuy> the first alert gives 'value=""', yet the second one does the right thing â€” value is set
[02:35:54] <sorush20> Cork:  I need a noob explanation of what to do
[02:36:04] <sorush20> which file should I edit
[02:36:16] <sorush20> and what should I edit it to
[02:36:23] <Cork> sorush20: if you can't find what causes it, start commenting out lines until the error goes away
[02:36:23] <MacroMan> Is there a way in which I could loop this idenfinately? http://jsfiddle.net/d6MmE/3/
[02:36:36] <Cork> then reduce until you find what causes it
[02:36:43] <poppiez> how do you scroll to an element inside a div with overflow: auto; height: 500px;?
[02:37:15] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, for some reason after doing that, my page keeps becoming totally unresponsive. any ideas?
[02:37:19] <poppiez> tried offset().top but it doesn't scroll to the proper place
[02:38:03] <dannN> Hi. Does anybody know an plugin, to combine 2 <ul>, which are parallel to each other, to one list, with animation?
[02:38:20] <sorush20> Cork: but that line is important.. it gives the effect
[02:38:24] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: after resetting the $.ajaxSetup() ??
[02:38:36] <sorush20> Cork: I just don't know how to edit it
[02:38:36] <AdvoWork> well, it was doing it before too
[02:38:40] <Cork> sorush20: uh... the solution is not to remove the row, its to find it
[02:39:07] <Cork> when you found it you need to do what should happen instead of what your doing
[02:39:46] <Cork> sorush20: cause right now you trying to use a function that doesn't exist
[02:39:58] <Cork> (for some reason)
[02:40:52] <MacroMan> Anybody able to help me work out how to make this loop indefinitely rather than just once? http://jsfiddle.net/d6MmE/4/
[02:41:04] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: is your .php responding back? try attaching a .error(function(data) { console.log(data); }) after your .post()
[02:41:27] <takkun1946> so... $.post( ... ).error(function(data) { console.log(data); });
[02:42:01] <Cork> MacroMan: you sould never EVER do things like that
[02:42:25] <bobuy> tokkun1946: any ideas why that might happen? i'm creating throw-away forms like this, but i need to be able to set some default values for some fields
[02:42:32] <Cork> MacroMan: you need to use the callbacks from animate to know when the animation ends
[02:42:48] <Cork> sould==should
[02:42:52] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, no errors seem to appear. Any other ideas how I can do this?
[02:43:29] <takkun1946> so... $.post( ... ).error(function(data) { console.log(data); }).complete(function() { console.log('she finished...'); });
[02:43:31] <dannN> Hi. Does anybody know an plugin, to combine 2 <ul>, which are parallel to each other, to one list, maybe with animation?
[02:43:38] <MacroMan> OK, But I'm not too sure how to declare a setTimeout in a call back
[02:43:46] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: attach the complete and see if it comes back from the PHP
[02:43:47] <sorush20> Cork: what about now?
[02:45:21] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, that finishes :s i do have another post request below it, so trying the same for that one
[02:45:27] <sorush20> I'm stuck I don't know what to do. I wish my knowledge wat the same as Cork. I'm using joomla with jquery and I wasn't expecting things to go wrong with the template.
[02:46:22] <takkun1946> bobuy: it should work. if you're using jquery $('input:hidden').val()
[02:46:57] <sorush20> is el.addEvent a function in my page?
[02:47:48] <recardo> Could I please have some personal assistance, I've been waiting patiently :)
[02:48:13] <Cork> sorush20: check your error console
[02:49:11] <sorush20> Cork: I know, I just don't understand what it means
[02:49:59] <recardo> http://jsfiddle.net/QU6Lv/
[02:50:16] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, still unresponsive, i dont get a fail or complete on the 2nd post. is there another way to do this? I'm looping, doing a function call, sending some info via $post to get more data, from that im then doing stuff and another $post, and from that 2nd post i'm setting some information. Any ideas?
[02:50:29] <recardo> I just cannot move this iframe widget to the right of the page. the last .css() instruction isn't working
[02:50:39] <recardo> $("div#ctl00_bct.BreadCrumb iframe.hukd-share-button").css({'position' : 'absolute', 'right' :'20px'}); // Position it on the page to right hand top edge
[02:50:59] <recardo> It's moving into postition within the DOM ok
[02:51:10] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: it's being held up in your PHP then. The page won't load until your PHP finishes
[02:51:33] <takkun1946> AdvoWork: and by finish, I mean fail or complete
[02:51:34] <recardo> This works in Chrome's console but just not when the real page loads
[02:53:20] <AdvoWork> takkun1946, can i do this with some other request or?

[02:59:09] <Kingsy> anyone used power zoomer before ?
[02:59:46] <recardo> MagicZoom Kingsy
[03:00:26] <Kingsy> recardo: does that cost?
[03:01:06] <Kingsy> ah
[03:01:12] <Kingsy> nm, but thats not really what I want
[03:01:33] <Kingsy> I wanted a jquery zoomer that replaces the mouse with the zoomed image.. not reproduces a seperate box
[03:01:40] <recardo> I might aswell have a chat with someone else whilst I await for Cork to get back to me :)
[03:03:01] <Kingsy> power zoom is EXACTLY what I need, and its free.. but it seems to be kinda flakey when you use it in a lightbox
[03:03:53] <Kingsy> the mouse enter event doesnt seem to fire half of the time
[03:05:25] <recardo> http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/powerzoomer.htm this one Kingsy?
[03:05:35] <Kingsy> yeah
[03:11:26] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:11:45] <jomofcw> Any tips about a good scrollbar plugin please ? (i.e. one you love to use :))
[03:11:51] <Kingsy> recardo: its really frustrating, cos its exactly what I need
[03:13:37] <disappearedng> I found a BIG design flaw with my site. So when my site is loading, I pop up a modal containing my game's instructions and it doesn't close by itself. User can press 'ESC' to close it, but then pressing 'ESC' too early will also cause firefox users to end the javascript loading prematurely. Any suggestions?
[03:13:55] <sorush20> could somone fix my problem for me?
[03:18:41] <recardo> there's too many people in here :) my problem's falling on deaf ears :(

[03:33:13] <crem> Too bad that US is asleep when I'm at work.
[03:33:31] <recardo> me too crem :)
[03:33:36] <recardo> bloody frustrating as hell
[03:34:06] <recardo> What's worst is knowing you've spent 2 days looking, trying,testing and getting nowhere and you know that someone in here will just KNOW :)

[03:36:16] <matt_> hi all
[03:36:41] <matt_> i've a question about the check browser close
[03:36:44] <matt_> ??
[03:38:59] <nFFF> crem, your trying to just duplicate an element?
[03:39:37] <nFFF> You have multiple issues with your code, first being your going to end up with invalid html
[03:42:31] <crem> nFFF, I need to generate several elements, with being able to address them separately. What's the correct way to do it? For example if I want to generate a table dynamically.
[03:43:25] <nFFF> $('.foo').clone().insertAfter($('.foo')); will duplicate element with class .foo
[03:43:34] <nFFF> and insert it after itself
[03:44:32] <nFFF> Youd probably want to generate them with a unique IDs like: #tr1, #tr2 etc
[03:44:36] <nFFF> or classes
[03:45:00] <nFFF> IDs need to be unique in valid html
[03:45:46] <nFFF> They also must start with a letter (no numbers only), although html5 may be more lenient with this, youd have to check docs, although it may fuark up some browsers using ids only
[03:45:49] <nFFF> numebrs only*
[03:50:18] <crem> But $('#id').after($('#id').clone().attr('id', 'moomoo')) should work, right?
[03:50:54] <crem> or even $('#id').after($('#id').clone().attr('id', undefined))  // or how can I remove an attribute?
[03:51:03] <css> moo moo, moo.
[03:51:27] <crem> Moo.
[03:52:36] <nFFF> crem ?tias
[03:52:40] <nFFF> ?tias
[03:52:41] <bot-t> Try It And See
[03:53:00] <nFFF> why not just load up a jsfiddle.net and experiment yourself?
[03:53:31] <nFFF> try null
[03:53:56] <crem> Thanks, will try it.
[04:02:38] <knickabocka> im new in jquery and doing some tests with a menu. http://lab.manstein-web.de/movement . im asking me now if there is a cooler way to animate the show() effect like i do here. it looks all like a lil bit dissonant
[04:03:45] <MikeH> Hi guys, is it possible to get the object/identifier for the new element when using .clone() ?
[04:06:38] <AdvoWork> Is there a way to pass information to a function, do a post request, do another post request and then end at the bottom of the function, in that order? as messing with async is freezing the page. Any suggestions please? Its currrently doing start of function, start of function, post, post, post post
[04:11:04] <nFFF> AdvoWork, I think you where here last night when it was suggested perhaps your code design was the issue
[04:11:21] <nFFF> Can you not get all the data within one post request?
[04:12:17] <AdvoWork> nFFF, this is a different issue, only found today :S i think lol. i'm in a loop, calling a function, actually would a code sample help?
[04:16:06] <AdvoWork> nFFF, this is my current code: http://jsfiddle.net/kMyL7/1/
[04:16:57] <knickabocka> im new in jquery and doing some tests with a menu. http://lab.manstein-web.de/movement . im asking me now if there is a cooler way to animate the show() effect like i do here. it looks all like a lil bit dissonant
[04:17:40] <umren> can anyone recommend some good customizable sliderBAR plugin? google gives only gallery sliders ;/
[04:18:01] <aaronmcadam> jq ui
[04:18:30] <umren> some others?
[04:18:56] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile has a nice one
[04:20:08] <xec> AdvoWork: your alert("after data function") doesn't make much sense, seeing as "the data function" i believe it refers to is a callback
[04:20:34] <xec> same goes for "end for auto populate"
[04:20:38] <xec> of*
[04:21:23] <AdvoWork> xec, it alerts the messages in the following order too: Before data function,Before data function,Before data function,Before data function,in Data function,in Data function,in Data function,in Data function,
[04:21:53] <gabriel9|work> day to you all: well here goes question: i created simple script for moving divs on webpage with mouse move and mouse down. All is OK but when i croll page it moves it to wrong place
[04:21:54] <xec> of course
[04:22:04] <xec> ?ajax101
[04:22:04] <bot-t> Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[04:22:09] <AdvoWork> I was expecting/hoping to make it do, Before data function, in Data function, and then adding data too
[04:22:42] <gabriel9|work> i use pageX and pageY and i presume it calculates that sizes without take in consideration of scroll offset
[04:22:42] <AdvoWork> xec, i know why its doing it, but even if i try ascyn: false it just kills the page, but no apparent errors though, I was wondering if there was another way to be able to do this?
[04:22:51] <xec> AdvoWork: first question is (like nFFF said) - can't you make the server return all you need with a single request?
[04:24:25] <amit> hi
[04:24:42] <Guest66213> hi ..
[04:24:57] <Guest66213> hello..
[04:27:50] <matt_> it's possible to catch event of onbeforeunload, becouse i need to konw if the user said yes or no  any idea ?
[04:27:55] <AdvoWork> xec, so still call my function in a loop and do just one post request?
[04:29:17] <AdvoWork> xec, but surely even then it would still fire the posts after everything else?
[04:29:46] <xec> AdvoWork: if you have *one* post you don't have to worry about "posts", do you?
[04:30:43] <xec> AdvoWork: changing what the server can do is the clean solution, asssuming you have control over it
[04:31:22] <AdvoWork> how do you mean, and yeah i've got full control over it. so i can still do:   loop > call function > infunction do post ?
[04:32:29] <gyaresu> Does anyone know why the default twitter button doesn't work in a google maps infoWindow. I've tried inline and linked.
[04:32:45] <xec> AdvoWork: you wouldn't need a loop
[04:32:57] <gyaresu> As in... How might I get javascript to load in a google maps infoWindow?
[04:33:16] <xec> AdvoWork: you just hand the server a list of things to get for you
[04:33:43] <Angelos_> hi there
[04:33:58] <Angelos_> I need some help on some jquery with wordpress
[04:34:10] <Angelos_> it seams not to be working but works externally
[04:37:13] <sorush20> this is the effect my site should have http://www.globbersthemes.com/demo/via-granitti/
[04:39:33] <AdvoWork> xec, loop > call function.  In function alert("before");  post_stuff(alert("in post");  alert("after");  even with one post request, its still doing:  before, after, before, after, before, after, before after, in post..
[04:39:38] <sorush20> but I don't know what to compare things to..
[04:40:35] <nFFF> AdvoWork, your loop is calling your function multiple times?
[04:40:39] <nFFF> What do you expect to happen?
[04:40:44] <xec> AdvoWork: what are you looping for
[04:41:00] <Kre10s> $el.animate({ width: '0%' }, 1500, ... the $el is first assigned display:block... If it is necessary for the image to be display:inline... how can I still animate the width?
[04:42:38] <matt_> any idea ?
[04:43:03] <sorush20> what is canvas?
[04:44:29] <AdvoWork> nFFF, xec yeah my loop is calling my function multiple times, but i need this to occur. So i need it to do:  loop > call function . In function do post request, end. loop > call function . In function do post request, end.  and so on. Any ideas, struggling with this
[04:47:50] <Kingsy> with jquery zoom libraries .. are there rules that dictate what size / aspect ratio the large image can be in relation to the small image ?
[04:48:07] <Kingsy> I have tried like 4 libs now and NONE of them have been in line when you hover over
[04:48:53] <nFFF> AdvoWork, why do you need to make multiple post requests within a loop?
[04:49:03] <nFFF> why cant you make just one request?
[04:49:36] <guy> $('<img />').attr('src', ay.url_static + 'uploads/pictures/' + response.uid + '.1.jpg').appendTo('.picture-loader'); I expect this to insert new IMG element inside the div. am I using wrong method?
[04:49:37] <ericandrewlewis> anyone know of a jquery image manipulation package?
[04:49:49] <ericandrewlewis> i've seen a couple that just do basic cropping, wondering if anything goes a little further
[04:50:17] <AdvoWork> nFFF, In my prior function, im doing a post request to get the number of products and certain information about those products in a post request. This works fine. Based on this number, i perform a loop, and you know the rest. Im thinking of a way to re design this. Is there no other way of going about this?
[04:50:31] <guy> Instead, it is added after the element.
[04:50:47] <nFFF> I have no idea what oyu're trying to achiebve
[04:50:58] <nFFF> Or why you can't just get the number of products, and perform one post request
[04:51:01] <nFFF> and just forget about the loop
[04:51:07] <nFFF> what does the loop achieve
[04:51:18] <nFFF> what does multiple server requests achieve that one cant?
[04:52:29] <evildmp> hi, can anyone suggest why http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/imagetest/ doesn't work in IE6 or 7?
[04:52:43] <evildmp> you should be able to select one of the images to have it open up in a lightbox
[05:12:30] <Vainoharhainen> I got a input type="date" field. And on iOS it will open the native datepicker. And i want to trigger a event when its changes. But its not working with .change()
[05:15:36] <Cork> Vainoharhainen: try on('input')
[05:16:05] <juho3> How do I refer to a class inside a parent element?
[05:16:30] <Cork> juho3: what do you mean inside?
[05:17:24] <juho3> let me try to phrase it
[05:17:48] <juho3> I want to select some ID from parent
[05:17:52] <Birliban> hi is there an plugin that sets default value for input text and makes the font e.g. grey, then if you write something into the field the font gets black again and default text disappers? i just found functions and plugins with the replace - not with the color thing.
[05:18:36] <juho3> I have a div with 3 images in it, 2 icons for rotating or deleting an image in the div, and one image I want to rotate or delete the whole div
[05:18:37] <Cork> Birliban: ?g html5 placeholder @ Birliban
[05:18:58] <juho3> Cork, atm I can delete the whole div with $(this).parent().remove();
[05:19:04] <Cork> Birliban: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-placeholder
[05:19:15] <juho3> Cork, but i'm trying to rotate an image inside the div, not the whole div
[05:19:30] <Birliban> Cork, ok, will check this! thanks... also for the correct name 'placeholder' ;-)
[05:19:37] <Cork> juho3: so you need to select the parend and from there find a child?
[05:19:41] <juho3> yes :)
[05:19:52] <juho3> i think so atleast, i'm really a novice with jquery
[05:19:57] <juho3> and javascript in general
[05:20:02] <Cork> Birliban: you prob need a js fallback for older browser though
[05:20:25] <Cork> juho3: $(this).parent().find('.some-class')
[05:20:35] <Vainoharhainen> Cork: not wokring =/
[05:20:51] <Cork> Vainoharhainen: ok (i just googled around a bit)
[05:21:17] <Birliban> Cork, right... but in this case ist only for a panel for myself and mates, we use html5 browsers ^^
[05:21:37] <juho3> Cork, thanks a LOT :)
[05:21:54] <Cork> Birliban: opera doesn't have full support, and ie9 has none
[05:23:00] <Birliban> Cork, ie9 none? wtf! really can't understand the redmond people... We use chrome / ff
[05:23:56] <Cork> Birliban: webkid and gecko has nice support, so then no prob
[05:24:00] <Cork> *webkit
[05:26:54] <Deiu> Helo!
[05:26:56] <Birliban> Cork, ok. i'm slowly moving from ff to chrome... chrome look&feels faster in many ways...
[05:26:57] <Deiu> Hello*
[05:27:13] <Deiu> Which is the correct method to "append" html data to an element id? For example, I use $("#description").html("Hello world!") for one iteration. What should I replace it with if I have to do it inside a loop?
[05:28:09] <Cork> Birliban: ya it does, for some parts (not all), but user integrity standpoint is what makes me stay away from them for the most part
[05:28:26] <Cork> Deiu: you could use append
[05:28:46] <Cork> Deiu: though you prob should build a string and add the collected string in one go
[05:29:23] <Deiu> Cork, yeah, but what if I need to do it dynamically? I might need to do some sort of preloading.
[05:29:33] <Deiu> And display once the data loads.
[05:29:53] <Cork> Deiu: a loop won't ever be rendered until the loop ends
[05:30:12] <Cork> Deiu: you need to use timers if you want partial rendering
[05:30:14] <Deiu> Oh? Then how should I proceed?
[05:30:54] <Cork> build the loop by dasy-chaining timer events
[05:31:08] <Deiu> I'm trying to fetch content from multiple URIs, parse and transform data, then display it once it's available.
[05:31:41] <Cork> uh... you know that append would be in unknown order then right?
[05:31:53] <Cork> and building a string would be imposible
[05:32:01] <Cork> (network trafic is async)
[05:32:25] <Deiu> Damn it...
[05:32:31] <Deiu> Any advice then?
[05:32:59] <Cork> Deiu: you would have to have place holders in the page to add the different content in
[05:33:20] <Cork> then they can set the values to those placeholders, and the order would be correct even if they'r out of order
[05:33:29] <Deiu> Like <div id=i>, with multiple values for i
[05:33:30] <Deiu> ?
[05:34:01] <Cork> or just a jquery selector variable
[05:34:07] <Cork> but ya, basically
[05:34:52] <Deiu> Ok, but what about fetching and parsing?
[05:35:16] <Cork> then you would just take the placeholder.html() and adding the part for that holder
[05:36:13] <Cork> (theres other ways to do it where you leave less things in the dom, but then the js becomes more complicated)
[05:37:11] <Ghan> is there a way to view all the data that's available on a page/
[05:37:12] <Ghan> ?
[05:37:13] <Deiu> Thanks!
[05:37:48] <Angelos_> hi there I have an issue with jQuery with WP, it seams not to be working
[05:38:04] <knickabocka> im new in jquery and doing some tests with a menu. http://lab.manstein-web.de/movement . im asking me now if there is a cooler way to animate the show() effect like i do here. it looks all like a lil bit dissonant
[05:44:25] <evildmp> I link to an html fragment (served up as a separate resource) in a fancyBox-based lightbox - but IE (6-8) doesn't like it: http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/imagetest/
[05:44:30] <evildmp> any suggestions why?
[05:44:52] <evildmp> I could put all the html fragments inline in the main page, but I would like to avoid that for reasons of economy
[05:45:10] <evildmp> it doesn't seem nice to load a dozen large images into a page
[05:45:20] <evildmp> I would prefer to load each one as required
[05:45:32] <Deiu> Cork, Do I have to generate the containers through js, if I don't know the numbers of elements I'm supposed to add?
[05:46:11] <Deiu> I guess I could run another loop before the main one, in which I generate the placeholders.
[05:46:27] <Cork> Deiu: the simplest is prob do generate a place holder in the loop and just use the variable in the callback
[05:46:37] <Deiu> (based on the number of iterations I will perform in the main loop)
[05:46:51] <Deiu> Ah yes, you're right!
[05:46:52] <Deiu> Thanks
[05:47:18] <Flo0815> can sb tell me plz what i have to do to use the easings from the jq-easing plugin (http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/) ?
[05:47:20] <Cork> var $placeholder = $('<div/>'); $parent.append($placeholder);  $.get(..., function() { $placeholer.html() });
[05:47:41] <Cork> Flo0815: easing is part of jquery core
[05:47:48] <Cork> you don't need a plugin
[05:48:15] <Flo0815> but the extra easings?
[05:48:21] <Flo0815> besides linear and swing
[05:48:27] <Cork> ah, then ya you need it
[05:48:40] <Cork> but it should just work if you include the js file
[05:48:44] <Flo0815> so, how do i use them? i included the .js-file
[05:49:02] <Flo0815> animate(... easing: 'ease...') won't do it
[05:49:12] <Cork> that should work
[05:49:16] <Flo0815> hm
[05:49:21] <Flo0815> *bugfixing*
[05:50:19] <Flo0815> lol now it works
[05:50:26] <Flo0815> thx Cork for telepathic help
[05:50:33] <Cork> :)
[06:02:08] <juho3> Do yo guys have experience with jquery-ui? I'm wondering if it's possible to use draggable in a way that it would snap to both grid AND element
[06:05:28] <rethus> how does the firefox ui-theme plugin work?
[06:08:32] <beepbeep_> what event gets called when you type into an input text tag?
[06:08:59] <kibble> beepbeep_: keyup and keydown are the most common to use
[06:09:44] <beepbeep_> okay :)
[06:09:50] <beepbeep_> seems like keypress is the one I'll use
[06:09:54] <beepbeep_> thx anyway!
[06:14:09] <knickabocka> i want to hide and show 2 elements. how can i can these 2 functions one after one.. the show() should start when the hide() is finished..
[06:15:20] <kibble> knickabocka: what is it you are planning to hide and show?
[06:15:46] <knickabocka> yes
[06:16:43] <kibble> knickabocka: the reason I ask is because it almost sounds as if you are trying to simluate something like the accordian animation
[06:16:53] <kibble> simulate even
[06:22:34] <vaicine> Is there a way in jquery to check if there are any on going ajax requests?
[06:24:27] <Someonelse> hi
[06:25:47] <Lichurec> Hi there ;)
[06:25:54] <Someonelse> i have a question regarding jquery ajax stuff, is there some onreadystatechange event in jquery?
[06:26:41] <Someonelse> the server reesponses are quite slow, so i want the user tp see the readystate
[06:26:48] <Someonelse> *to see
[06:31:41] <guest999999> When I use ajax to load an XMLDocument and insert some elements into my DOM, it doesn't have style information
[06:31:51] <guest999999> why does this happen and what is the workaround?
[06:32:22] <erebel55> does anyone know why this gives me errors? http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/7/
[06:33:29] <EdwardIII> hey
[06:33:52] <EdwardIII> is there a more elegant way to do this? i'm going to have a captcha before a load of applications in an app so this method will be a bit ugly when multipled numerous times: http://jsfiddle.net/JLQDJ/
[06:35:23] <EdwardIII> applications/actions
[06:38:31] <Flo0815> guest999999: where should the style info come from?
[06:38:56] <guest999999> Flo0815: the page I am inserting the xml into
[06:39:27] <Flo0815> ?!... so u load XML, like <test>testvalue</test>
[06:39:47] <Flo0815> and u want to insert an element with 'testvalue' inside in ur DOM
[06:39:49] <Flo0815> ?
[06:40:02] <guest999999> Flo0815: so, for example
[06:40:17] <guest999999> in my page I have class "articles" defined in the css
[06:40:36] <guest999999> I insert a div with class articles and it does not have the style information that I defined
[06:40:46] <guest999999> however, if I insert as a string it works
[06:40:56] <Flo0815> can u show me ur code?
[06:40:59] <guest999999> just not if it comes from an ajax-loaded xmldocument
[06:41:06] <guest999999> one moment
[06:41:29] <Lichurec> Hmmâ€¦ how can I catch JS erros from within jQ document.ready?
[06:41:45] <robkinyon> Lichurec: how would you catch JS errors anywhere else?
[06:42:03] <Lichurec> as in - I know that jQ wraps them with it's own try-catch blocks
[06:42:05] <Cork> Lichurec: try catch or $(window).on('error', function() {});
[06:42:23] <erebel55> is there a way to find out what jsfiddle is including when I select jQuery UI framework?
[06:42:32] <erebel55> because I'm trying to do it manually but it isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/6/
[06:42:35] <erebel55> any help?
[06:42:39] <Cork> erebel55: check the generated html
[06:42:49] <Lichurec> and I want to dig to thatâ€¦ window.onerror has a very limited amoiunt of information
[06:43:15] <Cork> erebel55: http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/6/show
[06:44:09] <erebel55> thanks Cork :) how did you get to that?
[06:44:12] <guest999999> Flo0815: I have to re-write the javascript which produces this problem because I had tried some other things and they didnt work
[06:44:24] <guest999999> just a minute and I'll have something to paste for you
[06:44:27] <Cork> erebel55: the embed menus and some manual hacking
[06:44:45] <Cork> erebel55: but simplry take your revision and add /show after it
[06:44:50] <Cork> *simply
[06:44:56] <erebel55> ahhh ok. thanks for teaching me :D

[06:47:37] <Cork> tilda: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/
[06:47:38] <sorush20> what is an uncaught type error
[06:47:38] <aqeel> do*
[06:48:11] <Cork> sorush20: you trying to for example trying to convert a dom object to a string

[06:49:48] <tilda> Cork : ok.  but error still occurs
[06:50:34] <erebel55> hmm i'm still getting an error :(  it doesn't look to be finding widget for some reason even tho i'm linking in resources. http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/8/
[06:50:38] <Flo0815> guest999999: what is articleSection.childNodes ?
[06:50:41] <tilda> could it be that processData  somehow fails on large variables ?
[06:50:42] <Flo0815> which value does it contain
[06:51:17] <guest999999> Flo0815: You can look at http://sybriumweb.appspot.com/ajax/template/main for the response xml
[06:51:17] <Cork> tilda: the variable you have there works for me
[06:51:35] <sorush20> Cork: can you recommend a site to learn java script?
[06:51:46] <robkinyon> guest999999: or you could just give us a snippet that shows the problem
[06:52:02] <tilda> Cork : what browser ? I use FF11 on win7x64
[06:52:19] <Flo0815> guest999999: thats the xml u request?
[06:52:40] <guest999999> robkinyon: sorry that I'm so unorganized, I have pasted the javascript, the page to run it on, and the xml which comes in the response. Is there something else you need?
[06:52:48] <guest999999> Flo0815: no, that's the response xml
[06:52:50] <Cork> tilda: ff and chrome
[06:53:09] <robkinyon> guest999999: you didn't nopaste any XML. You gave us a link to a page and expected us to know where on that page the XML you are asking about is
[06:53:47] <Flo0815> guest999999: if this is ur response to ur ajax-call, i would suggest u try 'html' as dataType in the ajaxcall

[06:54:49] <guest999999> Flo0815: How do I use that option?

[06:55:40] <martin-g> hi. anyone using https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery.eventsource or just plain EventSource ?
[06:55:42] <Cork> tilda: does http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/ return error for you?
[06:55:45] <Hawkee> finished my past 3 weeks project, woohoo
[06:55:55] <Flo0815> Hawkee cg!
[06:55:56] <Hawkee> mostly thanks to jQuery
[06:56:00] <martin-g> I have a problem that EventSource.close() causes EOF exceptions at the server side
[06:56:26] <Flo0815> guest999999: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[06:56:26] <martin-g> and I'm not sure there is a way to deal with them (except just ignore them)
[06:56:29] <melter> anyone know if there's a new plugins.jquery.com in the future?
[06:56:34] <Hawkee> ended up writing a triggeredAutocomplete widget for @mentions, that was the toughest part

[07:06:11] <VoipForces> Hi all, quick newb question, if I have multiple event handlers like \$('#close-1').click, \$('#close-2').click,â€¦ What is the best way to have a single handler for all and then know which item was clicked ?
[07:06:44] <quicksilver> VoipForces: write one handler which checks "this" ?
[07:06:55] <sssilver> Hello gentlemen
[07:07:05] <Manvaril> hello all
[07:07:25] <RandalSchwartz> and then assign a class to all those clicky things and just put the handler on the class not ids
[07:07:34] <VoipForces> quicksilver: ok, you have an exemple syntax? Maybe a class handler also would do the trick no ?
[07:07:43] <RandalSchwartz> if you have a *lot* of ids, you probably are heading the wrong way
[07:07:46] <sssilver> http://paste.pocoo.org/show/569034/ is this code syntactically correct?
[07:07:49] <tilda> Error using large variable value in ajax post request, the client doesn't send it. http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/  - help plz ?
[07:07:53] <sssilver> it's only 3 lines
[07:07:59] <quicksilver> VoipForces: whether it's a class handler or not is not relevant to "know which item is clicked"
[07:07:59] <fsdfsafs> hello
[07:08:25] <quicksilver> VoipForces: you still need to use "this" to work out which items was clicked, that's rather the point of having "this" in handlers.
[07:08:43] <quicksilver> $('#close-1').click(myfn); $('#close-2').click(myfn);
[07:08:52] <quicksilver> $('#close-1,#close-2').click(myfn);
[07:09:03] <quicksilver> $('.someclass').click(myfn);
[07:09:08] <quicksilver> ...whatever you like?
[07:09:27] <Manvaril> Can someone help me with my code, I can get it to switch out the hide/show button only once, I can't get it to do it more than once without refreshing the page. http://jsfiddle.net/2R9zF
[07:09:30] <VoipForces> quicksilver: nice, did now know of those syntax ;-)
[07:09:38] <quicksilver> sssilver: looks fine to me
[07:10:33] <nadeem> How to invoke a function on a selector when it is available in dom. like $('#some_dynamic_loading').gallery();
[07:12:10] <Manvaril> anyone?
[07:13:04] <Manvaril> idk what its wrong with it but it works once and then you click the one that was replaced and it just uses the src='#' instead of calling the ajax again
[07:13:57] <quicksilver> the event handler isn't there any more
[07:14:01] <quicksilver> you've removed the element and replaced it
[07:14:05] <AdvoWork> I'm doing a post request and getting JSON back, which is fine and valid. How do I access the each of the different stock_uom's? json is: {"return_data":[{"stock_uom":"Each","purchase_uom":"Each"},{"stock_uom":"A4","purchase_uom":"A4"},{"stock_uom":"Roll","purchase_uom":"Roll"},{"stock_uom":"Roll","purchase_uom":"Roll"}]}
[07:14:06] <quicksilver> so it doesn't have an event handler any more.
[07:14:35] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: json.return_data[2].stock_oum, for example.
[07:15:16] <Manvaril> can you explain quicksilver?
[07:15:39] <quicksilver> Manvaril: You bound a click handler to an element. YOu removed that element. The handler is now gone.
[07:15:45] <tilda> Error using large variable value in ajax post request, the client doesn't send it. http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/  - help plz ? I see ABORT in firebug
[07:15:51] <quicksilver> Manvaril: you added a new element. That new element does not have a click handler, so clicking it does nothing.
[07:16:08] <Manvaril> ok
[07:16:15] <Manvaril> so how do I fix it so it does what I want?
[07:16:19] <AdvoWork> quicksilver, can i somehow do a loop for how ever many records there are ?
[07:16:22] <Manvaril> lol i'm such a n00b
[07:16:26] <quicksilver> you do what I told you do yesterday, Manvaril.
[07:16:32] <quicksilver> you don't remove elemnets and replace them.
[07:16:57] <quicksilver> you either (1) just change the img src and leave the element in place or (2) you have two elements, one for the hide button and one for the show button, but you hide the one which doesn't apply.
[07:17:07] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: Yes. You can do that in the following way.
[07:17:14] <Manvaril> k
[07:17:15] <quicksilver> AdvoWork: (1) learn javascript. (2) program in javascript.

[07:18:22] <anli_> I would really like to have an error console in which I can click a link and get a stack dump instead of just a position in the code
[07:18:33] <anli_> Is that possible?
[07:19:15] <Manvaril> use chrome anli
[07:19:43] <Manvaril> you can open a javascript console and look through the code while your running the code
[07:19:49] <quicksilver> anli_: firebug, safari and chrome all have source-level debuggers with stack traces
[07:20:06] <aaronmcadam> I've fallen in love with chrome dev tools today
[07:20:25] <aaronmcadam> especially the canary/chromium trunk builds
[07:23:19] <tilda> aaronmcadam : perhaps you can help me to debug :   http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/
[07:23:45] <aaronmcadam> perhaps I will put my lunch in the oven first :p
[07:23:58] <tilda> hhh, good idea
[07:24:17] <aaronmcadam> in the meantime, update that fiddle with wha
[07:24:21] <aaronmcadam> what ur trying to do
[07:26:37] <tilda> alright good idea, updated it,
[07:28:31] <Manvaril> quicksilver, another problem is, my code is a list and some of the list items have the show/hide button at different states when they are dumping out of the database so some will have a show button and some will have a hide button, the hiding of the buttons in an element and showing only the ones that are need might not work
[07:30:02] <erebel55> meh I still can't seem to figure out why this is giving me an error within juery.ui.mouse.js http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/10/

[07:46:53] <erebel55> lol dangit :P
[07:46:55] <Eartz> thang : indeed, sorry ^
[07:47:33] <thang> erebel55: the page loads fine for me, unless you absolutely need the latest version you can include jquery ui on the side
[07:47:59] <erebel55> thang: well it loads but look @ the console
[07:48:10] <erebel55> it's giving an error about widget when i try and load myself
[07:48:20] <kibble> erebel55: they are 403's the jqueryui site is clearly causing issues
[07:48:22] <erebel55> and i know i can load on the side, but i want to get working this way for when I move it to files
[07:49:27] <erebel55> kibble: what is giving the 403?
[07:49:57] <pilch> hey, I have issue with IE v8 and positioning some widgets
[07:50:04] <kibble> jqueryui.com, does your console not list anything useful?  Mine tells me exactly what the error is, what are you using IE?
[07:50:09] <pilch> its fine in FF and fine in Chrome.
[07:50:20] <thang> erebel55: im seeing the same thing kibble is
[07:50:22] <pilch> I'm not seeing any erros
[07:50:24] <erebel55> kibble: hmm that is weird. I'm using chrome
[07:50:42] <thang> <- chrome on ubuntu
[07:51:02] <pilch> I would be very greatful for any assistance as I've been trying to resolve this all day

[07:53:04] <vangelis183> Anyone in helping mood today? Need to filter an unsorted list and pass Â a class to a specific DIV. Code is here -> http://jsfiddle.net/G4K9c/
[07:53:42] <erebel55> thang: is there a way to change console settings or something?
[07:54:09] <itsgreen> How can I get the nth number of an item, ie. I wanted to know that the image clicked is the 8th image inside a gallery div, or if it is the 10th I want it to alert('10')
[07:55:00] <itsgreen> Gallery is just an example, but say there are 20 images inside it, I want it to alert('8') when I click on the 8th image
[07:55:43] <kibble> itsgreen: then give each img tag some attribute and create an on click event to read it with .attr
[07:55:53] <thang> erebel55: i havent changed any settings, but im seeing the same things on my win7 chrome
[07:56:47] <erebel55> I haven't changed any settings either :S
[07:57:29] <itsgreen> kibble: there isn't some selector or something that will let me know what N it is?
[07:58:14] <erebel55> thang: can you please post the link to the fiddle you are lookin @?
[07:58:42] <thang> erebel55: http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/11/
[07:58:47] <kibble> itsgreen: you can try .index(this) probably.  I just don't know what your markup looks like so .attr is safer
[07:58:59] <itsgreen> ah k
[07:59:22] <erebel55> thang: ok, yes the same one. this is very interesting
[08:00:30] <kibble> itsgreen: plus index is always 0 bases so you have to account for that unless the only thing you want to do is act on the index rather then actually know which image they clicked on you're fine
[08:01:43] <Rushing> the best way is just to look at previous siblings usually
[08:01:55] <Rushing> in a list, $li.prevAll("li").length is the index of a list item
[08:02:06] <itsgreen> kibble: yeah I don't care what the image is :) just want to know what N it has ;)
[08:02:17] <kibble> now you know then
[08:02:52] <Rushing> i'm animating the scroll to a certain position on the page, then updating the window.location.hash, but i'm getting a weird jump back to the top of the page in IE7
[08:03:07] <Rushing> has anyone else experienced this?
[08:03:31] <knickabocka> i want to hide and show 2 elements. how can i can these 2 functions one after one.. the show() should start when the hide() is finished..
[08:04:21] <Rushing> knickabocka, use the callbacks
[08:04:24] <Ysecn> knickabocka: http://api.jquery.com/hide/ use the callback
[08:04:40] <Rushing> $thing.show(100, function(){ $(this).hide() ;});
[08:05:12] <Rushing> or you can use queue. $thing.show().queue(function() {$(this).hide()})
[08:05:17] <Rushing> ?queue @ knickabocka
[08:05:17] <bot-t> knickabocka, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[08:05:58] * tilda[A] is now away - Reason : Auto-Away after 30 minutes
[08:06:44] <itsgreen> kibble: thanks for the help, it does what I want :) didn't know the index function ;)
[08:07:52] <kibble> itsgreen: I've forgotten almost everything I've read on jquery but I remembered the word index which was enough
[08:07:54] <Ysecn> I'm building an ajax call with statusCode: and a handler for 401, how can I handle all other errors that arent 401?
[08:08:49] <erebel55> thang, kibble: any idea how i can debug this issue?
[08:08:57] <itsgreen> kibble: it was to build a small powerful tab thingy without setting id's and such, but works great now :)
[08:09:11] <danzik17> Ysecn: just use the error callback as your default handler - in there, check that the status code is not one of the ones that you are explicitly handling via statusCode
[08:09:13] <itsgreen> thought the gallery example was a little clearer
[08:11:04] <Deiu> Does anyone know if there's a problem with jquery loading a list of URIs in a loop (one URI for each iteration)?
[08:11:34] <Manvaril> Hey Quicksilver
[08:11:46] <Manvaril> I got it working
[08:11:47] <Manvaril> http://jsfiddle.net/2R9zF/1/
[08:12:30] <DerekPioneer> had an ajax() request that was working fine on http://dev.site.com/, when i pushed it to live all the sudden the ajax request returns errors, it is now calling httpS://www.site.com/
[08:12:57] <erebel55> assuming the phantom 404s are correct, how can i fix them?
[08:13:41] <Manvaril> go through your code and make sure your anchors are correct and all your pathing is correct
[08:14:47] <erebel55> i've already checked paths
[08:14:51] <erebel55> http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/11/
[08:14:55] <DerekPioneer> any ideas on why ajax() stops working when i switch from http to https
[08:15:00] <DerekPioneer> and what can i do to fix it
[08:15:07] <CharlieM751> how can I trigger running my click function without actually clicking the component?
[08:15:25] <Ysecn> isnt changing protocols "cross domain"?
[08:16:03] <DerekPioneer> crossDomain:true doesn't fix it
[08:16:04] <Manvaril> use a mouse event or some other event
[08:18:38] <Whirl3d> if I say    var test=$(el).wrap(outerdiv) will test be $(el) or $(outerdiv)?
[08:19:23] <Whirl3d> sorry, in other words, does wrap return the wrapper or the original element (wrappee?)
[08:19:56] <Whirl3d> nvm, I'll look it up.
[08:20:25] <Rushing> Whirl3d: it'll still be el
[08:20:46] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: is jquery ui's simulate functionality a separate project?
[08:20:51] <johnkpaul> https://github.com/eduardolundgren/jquery-simulate ?
[08:21:35] <Whirl3d> Rushing, thanks. I couldn't find it quickly in the api and I'm WAY late on a deadline.
[08:22:33] <erebel55> am i forgetting to link something here? http://dl.dropbox.com/u/40722232/test_jquery_slider.html
[08:22:36] <erebel55> code is here http://pastie.org/3641994
[08:22:52] <erebel55> oh nvm forgot to link jQuery
[08:23:24] <johnkpaul> :)
[08:23:25] <Rushing> np
[08:31:31] <Xotix> hi
[08:31:48] <Xotix> why does this http://pastebin.com/WBRei8hH give me 	.	Uncaught TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON
[08:31:48] <Xotix> 	.	
[08:35:19] <Lars___> hey there
[08:35:50] <Lars_D> someone available?
[08:36:21] <johnkpaul> Xotix: can you log what the map returns?
[08:37:00] <Xotix> johnkpaul:  how?
[08:37:06] <johnkpaul> console.log
[08:37:10] <johnkpaul> ?mdn console
[08:37:11] <bot-t> johnkpaul, .toArray() - Retrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set, as an array. http://api.jquery.com/toArray/
[08:38:04] <Xotix> johnkpaul you mean the obj im trying to make a json out of it?
[08:38:08] <johnkpaul> yeah
[08:38:26] <Lars_D> i need an instant search with <td>, not <div> ... who may help me? :)
[08:39:24] <Woet> Lars_D: .. what?
[08:40:02] <kindness> hey, can someone tell me why the node i've selected doesn't have an 'options' attribute even though the w3c says everything in jquery has an options attribute?
[08:40:17] <kindness> i'm confused as hell
[08:40:27] <pilch> I have two social bookmarking widgets (shopping site deals one and Google +1).  They are both showing where I want for Chrome and FF but there is no sign of Google +1 within f*kin IE.  Help me please darlings
[08:40:28] <pilch> :)
[08:41:21] <Lars_D> i have a database and select all entries .. all of them are screened in a table ..
[08:41:40] <Lars_D> and now i have to select some of them when they are matching input field ..
[08:42:07] <Xotix> johnkpaul, the img src's? ["/upload2/1/ie_5.png", "/upload2/1/background.png", "/resources/img/pic1.jpg"]
[08:42:09] <Lars_D> something like ebay or amazon, just instant ..
[08:43:20] <johnkpaul> Xotix: hmm, that seems like just an array of strings, no circular references
[08:43:42] <erebel55> could someone link me to simple jquery UI example for just setting it up via links to js and css files online? I'm having a horrible time just getting that to work :(
[08:43:44] <Xotix> johnkpaul yes
[08:44:27] <Lars_D> Woet? :)
[08:44:46] <jayflux> will transitionend ever be added to jQuery
[08:44:55] <Woet> Lars_D: I have absolutely no idea what your question is in relation to jQuery
[08:44:59] <Xotix> johnkpaul i als oget errors 404 not found because he tries to load them somehow.
[08:45:20] <Lars_D> okay, wait a moment pls
[08:45:39] <Lars_D> http://drasticcode.com/2009/6/17/instant-search-in-pure-javascript-almost-instantly
[08:45:55] <Lars_D> this works with <div>, but how to change that it works with <td> ?
[08:46:22] <Xotix> johnkpaul: do you know why it creates a get for each image here?
[08:46:56] <johnkpaul> Xotix: because $(data) actually creates dom elements
[08:47:25] <Lars_D> @ Woet:
[08:47:48] <Woet> Lars_D: the code you see on that page will work just fine with tds too.
[08:47:50] <Lars_D> Woet: I ever forget about set your name in front :D
[08:48:03] <Woet> Lars_D: just adjust your HTML.
[08:48:07] <Xotix> johnkpaul:  so how can i stop that?
[08:48:58] <johnkpaul> so Xotixwhat are you realy trying to do here?
[08:49:07] <johnkpaul> what would you write at line 8 if you weren't debugging
[08:49:10] <Lars_D> Woet: I'll try it .. Just a second pls
[08:49:21] <s34n> I have a small accordian that isn't working at all.
[08:49:31] <s34n> It doesn't even display as an accordian
[08:49:55] <s34n> other jqueryui widgets are working fine on the same page
[08:50:17] <pilch> anyone had fun with </g:plusone> in IE when trying to appendTo() ?
[08:50:21] <s34n> so I know my css is set correctly
[08:50:23] <pilch> Well I bloody am.
[08:50:30] <pilch> this is klling me today
[08:50:54] <erebel55> what is the recommended way for using libraries such as jquery, jquery UI, etc? use an existing url of a dependent place it's hosted already? or save the files and host them yourself?
[08:51:05] <Xotix> johnkpaul get some content. , get all src paths, submit it to the server, copy everything, on callback put the content into an wisywig adjust the src paths. without 404 get errors. thats the whole task
[08:51:13] <robkinyon> erebel55: google has a link that you can download from
[08:51:19] <robkinyon> or include in your html pages
[08:51:22] <s34n> erebel55: either way
[08:51:39] <johnkpaul> Xotix: why would you ask the server for html, extract the src on the front end, and then submit those back to the serveR?
[08:51:39] <robkinyon> but, it's generally best practice to host it yourself because then you know exactly what version you're getting
[08:51:44] <s34n> erebel55: I host my own for a few reasons
[08:51:51] <johnkpaul> why not do that calculation on the server entirely
[08:52:06] <robkinyon> and, even though it's google, sometimes google is slow or unavailable (rare, but it does happen)
[08:52:16] <Xotix> johnkpaul, because i'm getting it from a different domain.
[08:52:18] <robkinyon> now, your page doesn't work, even though the HTML is downloaded
[08:52:45] <cyberalien> Is there alternative to html() function that works with xml? I've imported xml data via $.parseXML(), converted it to jquery object, now trying to extract it as string
[08:52:58] <s34n> and why cause needless traffic on the cdn
[08:53:03] <erebel55> thanks for the help guys
[08:53:05] <kibble> s34n: the accordian is very fickle.  You may have an unclosed tag
[08:53:14] <s34n> and why subject your users to tracking by the cdn
[08:53:57] <kibble> s34n: one benifit is the caching, if lots of the websites a user visit uses the cdn then they won't have to download the file again
[08:54:48] <robkinyon> there is no "Right Answer"â„¢ - it all depends on what you consider most important in your architecture/design/infrastructure/etc
[08:54:55] <Lars_D> Woet: okay, you're right .. :)
[08:55:10] <Xotix> johnkpaul: so how do i get my json? any idea?
[08:55:30] <s34n> kibble: the tags are xslt-generated, and all well-formed
[08:55:34] <johnkpaul> Xotix: don't parse te html
[08:55:34] <erebel55> thang, kibble: so all the .js files i was linking from jquery.com were causing 403s?
[08:55:39] <johnkpaul> or rather, don't use jquery to do it
[08:55:42] <johnkpaul> because it will craete elements
[08:55:50] <johnkpaul> although I don't know why your code is not working without a live example
[08:55:55] <johnkpaul> maybe look into a regex?
[08:56:12] <johnkpaul> src="((?:[^\\"]+|\\.)*)" will get your match
[08:56:15] <kibble> s34n: that's usually the problem I run into
[08:56:41] <Xotix> johnkpaul, doing it serverside is no option. regex, hmm, probably i have to thanks
[08:56:42] <kibble> erebel55: yes
[08:57:05] <erebel55> kibble: hm ok, i'll try and host them myself and see if it fixes
[08:57:12] <erebel55> still sad that i can't see the errors myself
[08:57:22] <Lars_D> Woet: How do I check two values now?
[08:57:33] <Woet> Lars_D: which values?
[08:58:44] <Lars_D> Woet: I get a few values from database, like offer, webspace, price etc .. The second value is the price ..
[08:59:03] <ptime> hi
[08:59:15] <ptime> I am using jquery .animation to cause an image to oscillate back and forth repeatedly, but i think this causes an stack overflow (or somethin glike that) of the animation queue, it doesn't really cause problems besides giving a javascript error if you debug it, os there a way to have it contineously oscillate back and forth without overloading the queue?
[08:59:42] <Lars_D> Woet: And now there shall only be results which match both .. Max. price = input price AND offer = input offer ..
[09:00:46] <Lars_D> Woet: so price shall be lower or even the entered value ..
[09:00:56] <Lars_D> Woet: likw <= in PHP
[09:01:00] <Woet> Lars_D: time to adjust some of the code in that example then :)
[09:01:00] <Lars_D> like*
[09:01:03] <Woet> <= works fine in javascript too
[09:01:14] <pilch> why would a block of code sit in the top left of page but show in its CORRECT place when refreshing the window?
[09:01:23] <Lars_D> Woet: I know, but i'm bloody newbie at js :D
[09:01:23] <pilch> IE you are a slagfest!
[09:01:32] <Woet> Lars_D: i'm sure you can learn
[09:01:45] <pilch> please help ive been here all bloody day
[09:01:46] <pilch> :D
[09:02:01] <pilch> any jquery IE pros?
[09:02:12] <Lars_D> Woet: couldn't you just give me advice how to control a second value? :) then i'd be able to check third and fourth ... ^^
[09:02:31] <rabbi11> i am using jquery.visualize for graphs and jquery tabs, i have got 2 tabs and has graph in 2 tabs as well, the graphs are shown only in the first tab, but not in the other.... any solution ?
[09:02:58] <Woet> Lars_D: <= works fine in javascript too
[09:03:49] <Lars_D> Woet: $(this).children('.search_text')[0].innerHTML.match(re) -> this checks if it matches in one or more chars, right?
[09:04:13] <Woet> Lars_D: it checks whether the search query exists in the innerHTML
[09:04:48] <Lars_D> Woet: and now i need to check if it exists AND if it's lower or even given value ..
[09:04:58] <Woet> Lars_D: okay, go for it :)
[09:05:16] <Lars_D> Woet: I would, if i'd knew how xD
[09:06:46] <Lars_D> Woet: $(this).children('.search_offer')[0].innerHTML.match(re) AND $(this).children('.search_price')[0] <= innerHTML.match(re)
[09:06:48] <Lars_D> Woet: like this?
[09:07:32] <erebel55> kibble: still getting the errors? http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/14/
[09:07:47] <BMCouto> Hey everyone ever had any problems with Modernizr.load() complete running before everything is loaded?
[09:08:38] <rabbi11> i am using jquery.visualize for graphs and jquery tabs, i have got 2 tabs and has graph in 2 tabs as well, the graphs are shown only in the first tab, but not in the other.... any solution ?
[09:08:46] <knickabocka> this seems not to work for me....: setTimeout($('div.downloads').fadeIn('slow'), 6000);
[09:08:53] <knickabocka> it wont wait for 6sec.
[09:08:54] <faraway> BMCouto: what do you men with before everything is loaded
[09:08:56] <kibble> erebel55: you didn't have jquery ui checked off on the left
[09:09:08] <melter> is there going to be a new plugins site?
[09:09:19] <erebel55> yeah i know that is the point...I'm trying to get it working without checking that
[09:09:27] <erebel55> that is why i'm linking in the ui myself
[09:09:39] <Lars_D> Woet: *waving white flag* ^^
[09:09:45] <erebel55> but i'm having a hard time doing it :(
[09:09:51] <BMCouto> faraway:  im loading jquery and several other scripts
[09:09:56] <Eartz> knickabock : try this : setTimeout("$('div.downloads').fadeIn('slow')", 6000);
[09:10:03] <BMCouto> the on complete im calling a function of mine, and its now available yet
[09:10:13] <BMCouto> *not available
[09:10:39] <faraway> BMCouto: as long as the dom is loaded it should be no problem
[09:10:49] <erebel55> kibble: because i want to know how to do it when I implement this outside of jsfiddle
[09:11:25] <kibble> erebel55: UI can be built with different widgets,  seems unlikely but the one you are linking must be missing something
[09:12:47] <erebel55> kibble: hmm ok, well i was going off of this http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/slider-vertical.html
[09:13:04] <rabbi11> i am using jquery.visualize for graphs and jquery tabs, i have got 2 tabs and has graph in 2 tabs as well, the graphs are shown only in the first tab, but not in the other.... any solution ?
[09:13:04] <BMCouto> faraway:  the dom is loaded? sorry?
[09:13:36] <aaronmcadam> oh my
[09:13:44] <eddd> hi, is $("some").change(function(){}); deprecated or smth, because i always got Syntax error, unrecognized expression: change for newest jquery version
[09:14:02] <aaronmcadam> nope
[09:14:20] <aaronmcadam> ?demo
[09:14:21] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:16:09] <erebel55> how i can i debug the problem? not really sure where to start
[09:16:14] <Lars_D> Woet: no longer available?
[09:16:36] <DarkGHost`> where should I go fo help with uploadify?
[09:16:52] <aaronmcadam> ...
[09:18:31] <aaronmcadam> shit
[09:18:33] <aaronmcadam> there's no repo
[09:18:42] <i3ooi3oo> I'm trying to recreate a live search that is available online.  I have only modified the lookup page to meet the search I am wanting.  The search page (live.php) returns the data I am searching for yet the page doesn't work. http://pastebin.com/HPeGsYcH <- is both pages.
[09:19:17] <aaronmcadam> it looks shit
[09:19:47] <aaronmcadam> sorry I've given up reading PHP code, it's too digusting
[09:19:51] <faraway> BMCouto: sorry i think i probably did not understand what you mean
[09:25:24] <i3ooi3oo> aaronmcadam: was that php comment direct at me?  There is no problem in the actual PHP code.
[09:26:09] <aaronmcadam> just puttin it out there
[09:26:39] <BMCouto> faraway:  check if you understand here http://jsfiddle.net/pr5wG/
[09:28:21] <i3ooi3oo> is there anything other than having the jquery.js files required on the server?
[09:28:47] <faraway> BMCouto: the complete should, if i remember right. only be called if all scripts are loaded. the only problem i see is that (if i remember right) the order in which the scripts are loaded is not defined
[09:28:55] <Zzaichik> call jquery from google libraries
[09:29:06] <Zzaichik> in fact, I think it's faster
[09:29:17] <faraway> BMCouto: it could happen that your assets are loaded before jquery
[09:29:33] <BMCouto> faraway:  how can i avoid this?
[09:29:39] <faraway> BMCouto: so you should first load jQuery and then the dependencies
[09:31:12] <faraway> BMCouto: i updated your code "http://jsfiddle.net/pr5wG/1/"  but no guarantee that the syntax is correct, it's just that you see what i mean
[09:31:19] <Pupeno_W> Does jquery provide a way to turn a hash into json (a string)?
[09:32:01] <faraway> BMCouto: but you need to check if there are some scripts that need query.ui at loading time.
[09:32:53] <ajpiano> Pupeno_W: see ?stringify
[09:32:53] <bot-t> Pupeno_W, JSON.stringify() is the standard and recommended way of encoding an object to a JSON string representation of that object. It is a method of the native JSON object in many browsers, and it is recommended you use json2.js (https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js) to provide a fallback. jQuery	does not need this functionality internally and thus does not provide a convenience method to do so.
[09:33:37] <BMCouto> faraway: yeah there are, they all need jquery and some of them jqueryui, but how do i make sure they get loaded? i though that modernizr did that for me already
[09:33:53] <Hawkee> can somebody give me an example of how I'd do $(document).on("hover", "#element" ...
[09:34:01] <Hawkee> I'm trying to figure out the syntax following what I have here
[09:34:06] <Lars_D> Woet: I'm desperated ._. I don't manage to check 2 values =/
[09:35:58] <aaronmcadam> Hawkee did u read the api?
[09:36:01] <rabbi11> i am using jquery.visualize for graphs and jquery tabs, i have got 2 tabs and has graph in 2 tabs as well, the graphs are shown only in the first tab, but not in the other.... any solution ?
[09:36:14] <Hawkee> yes, I'm just a bit unclear of the particular syntax
[09:36:19] <Hawkee> I can't find this exact example
[09:36:54] <Hawkee> I know how .on works and I know how to use .live to set up a hover, but I just can't reconcile the two
[09:37:06] <aaronmcadam> well ur right
[09:37:29] <aaronmcadam> $( context ).on( event, selector, callback )
[09:37:41] <aaronmcadam> simple
[09:37:42] <Zzaichik> $(document).on("hover", "#element", function() { console.log('hello world') });
[09:38:23] <faraway> BMCouto: it's correct that they are loaded, but in which order they are loaded depends (afaik) on the source (how fast the server delivers the file). so you first need to load jquery like shown in my update. if jquery is loaded, you can load all scripts that extends the functionality of jquery
[09:39:01] <Hawkee> thank you Zzaichik, but how do I define the mouseenter and mouseleave functions within there
[09:39:12] <happyface> How can I stop the click() event from occuring if the user cilcks and drags on the area?
[09:39:18] <Zzaichik> ah
[09:39:24] <Hawkee> would it be function() { mouseenter: ?, mouseleave: ?, });
[09:39:36] <jefholloman> happyface: you'll want to catch the click event and prevent default
[09:40:20] <jefholloman> you'll have to handle it different ways for different browsers, because of the way events propagate in IE vs other browsers
[09:41:27] <Hawkee> I guess I could just .on("mouseenter" and .on("mouseleave" independently
[09:41:34] <Zzaichik> Hawkee:  http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/
[09:41:41] <aaronmcadam> you can bind multiple events at once
[09:41:57] <Zzaichik> This is a basic example. Although, with hover it automatically has that behavior
[09:42:07] <aaronmcadam> true
[09:42:28] <Zzaichik> d'oh, I forgot a quote..
[09:43:02] <aaronmcadam> you also mixed them tut tut
[09:43:49] <Hawkee> Zzaichik, thank you that looks good
[09:44:08] <Zzaichik> aaronmcadam:  I mixed what now?
[09:44:19] <aaronmcadam> ur quotes
[09:44:21] <happyface> jefholloman: hmm ok thanks
[09:44:35] <Zzaichik> oh - hehe. I actually just copied his stuff over
[09:44:45] <Zzaichik> Mine is single quote awesomeness
[09:44:51] <Joeytje50> hey, is it possible to make an AJAX request run x() when the request arrives within 5 seconds, and do y() if the request doesn't arrive within 5 seconds?
[09:45:40] <zykes-> http://93.124.225.45:6543/ < anyone get it why the mbMenu.js works on the index page but not on way http://93.124.225.45:6543/recommendation ?
[09:45:59] <Hawkee> Zzaichik, I'm not getting any activity: http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/1/
[09:46:02] <aaronmcadam> wow, direct IPs to ur staging, that's brave
[09:46:19] <erebel55> i have to be making this harder then it is. i dont see how it can be this hrad just to import jquery ui correctly
[09:46:29] <aaronmcadam> ?demo
[09:46:29] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:46:51] <Joeytje50> ^@ who?
[09:47:16] <Zzaichik> Hawkee: it was my missing quote. http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/3/
[09:47:58] <Joeytje50> is it possible to make an AJAX request run x() when the request arrives within 5 seconds, and do y() if the request doesn't arrive within 5 seconds?
[09:48:02] <Hawkee> there we go, I must have broken it
[09:48:03] <aaronmcadam> Joeytje50: you can just use a timeout property
[09:48:11] <Joeytje50> how?
[09:48:11] <aaronmcadam> Joeytje50: and bind to the error
[09:48:14] <aaronmcadam> uhm
[09:48:16] <aaronmcadam> read the api
[09:48:25] <aaronmcadam> bind to the error callback
[09:48:29] <aaronmcadam> set a timeout to it
[09:48:35] <Joeytje50> like   timeout: '5000', error: y
[09:48:36] <Joeytje50> that?
[09:48:48] <aaronmcadam> not sure what the error callback property is called
[09:48:52] <aaronmcadam> but timeout is right
[09:49:07] <Joeytje50> oh wait it's     timeout: 5000, then right?
[09:49:08] <aaronmcadam> I used the promise API so
[09:49:21] <aaronmcadam> yeah, an int not a string
[09:49:42] <zykes-> aaronmcadam: yeh, did a mistake there
[09:49:49] <aaronmcadam> eh?
[09:49:49] <Deiu> Is there any way I can define a new object like this: var obj[i] = new $myClass(); ?
[09:50:06] <zykes-> but I don't get it, it's working fine when i use the scripts on the index page but not a change if not
[09:50:15] <Deiu> the new object must have a limited life time (during that iteration)
[09:50:35] <aaronmcadam> you can't do that
[09:50:46] <aaronmcadam> but what you can do, in a horrible, filthy way
[09:51:14] <Deiu> yes?
[09:51:15] <aaronmcadam> is window[obj][i] = new class
[09:51:25] <aaronmcadam> is window['obj'][i] = new class
[09:51:41] <aaronmcadam> but dunno why I told u that
[09:51:48] <aaronmcadam> u didn't hear that ok haha
[09:52:02] * Deiu slowly backs away...
[09:52:25] <aaronmcadam> but that will programnatically create vars
[09:52:27] <aaronmcadam> mm*
[09:52:49] <RustIndy> just released a word cloud plugin for jquery, similar to wordle.net - https://github.com/indyarmy/jQuery.awesomeCloud.plugin
[09:52:52] <takkun1946> Deiu: you want to make sure obj[] is defined somewhere else, like if you need it to be a list, why not use an array def
[09:53:00] <Deiu> Is there no other way to have a function perform something in the iteration?
[09:53:01] <RustIndy> please take a look at the code and feel free to make suggestions :) thanks guys!
[09:53:18] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: no tests?
[09:53:35] <Deiu> takkun1946, I do have a "var obj = {}"
[09:53:41] <takkun1946> var obj = new Array(); for(var i=0; i < foo.length; i++) { obj.push(new myClass()); }
[09:53:59] <RustIndy> nope, just a demo. js is not my mother tongue. i will add tests in a later version, once i learn how to do them properly in js
[09:54:02] <aaronmcadam> s/new Array()/[]
[09:54:27] <takkun1946> Deiu: so you don't want to call 'var obj[i]' then
[09:54:36] <Deiu> then how should I call it?
[09:54:48] <takkun1946> because you are creating a local instance of obj, assuming it's in a loop
[09:54:48] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: tests and demos are a must
[09:55:14] <takkun1946> i assume you have var obj = {}; defined prior to your loop, correct?
[09:55:19] <Deiu> Taggnostr, yes
[09:55:26] <Deiu> takkun1946, yes
[09:55:31] <Hawkee> Zzaichik, another problem.. the mouseover doesn't trigger: http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/5/
[09:55:33] <RustIndy> aaronmcadam: i know mate, i just don't know enough about JS yet to do proper testing. the demo is there though :)
[09:55:35] <Hawkee> it only shows 2's, no 1's
[09:56:02] <takkun1946> and you're doing "var obj[i] = new $myClass();", this creates a local var to your loop and will not put it in the obj array you defined outside of your loop
[09:56:04] <aaronmcadam> haha u don't inspire me to use ur plugin saying that hhaa
[09:56:27] <RustIndy> hehe
[09:56:41] <RustIndy> can you suggest a plugin that does have proper testing that i can look at?
[09:56:45] <takkun1946> so... just pull off the var prior to your "obj[i] = new $myClass();"
[09:57:06] <aaronmcadam> dammit
[09:57:19] <aaronmcadam> I want a way to make github change headers so it will render html
[09:57:34] <takkun1946> Deiu: because, i'm guessing you're hear asking because you can't access what you're expecting to be there once you've left the loop
[09:57:40] <aaronmcadam> can't see a demo link
[09:57:40] <takkun1946> here**
[09:57:42] <Deiu> Yeah
[09:57:42] <Hawkee> Can somebody help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/5/  - for some reason the first function doesn't trigger when I hover over the box
[09:57:51] <Deiu> Actually, let me show you the code
[09:58:05] <RustIndy> ahhh, didn't think of that. give me a few minutes to get one online… thanks
[09:58:30] <takkun1946> that'd be better... cuz i'm making a lot of assumptions
[09:58:32] <Deiu> takkun1946, http://webid.fcns.eu/lookup/card.js
[09:58:38] <Deiu> bah
[09:58:38] <aaronmcadam> It'd be nice if github would let u bloody render the html
[09:58:42] <Deiu> need to paste it somewhere
[09:58:44] <Deiu> hold on
[09:59:45] <faraway> Hawkee: you can only pass one function as handler, look at the api
[09:59:57] <Deiu> takkun1946, http://pastebin.com/F18LbWqS
[10:00:05] <Hawkee> faraway, yes that's what I figured,  so how should I accomplish this?
[10:00:20] <Hawkee> since hover requires two functions
[10:01:11] <ajpiano> it doesn't require two functions
[10:01:14] <ajpiano> that's what he's saying
[10:01:49] <Hawkee> hmm, I'm still a bit unclear how this should be done
[10:01:51] <faraway> Hawkee:http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/6/
[10:02:04] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: if u create a gh-pages branch that'll give u a github page
[10:02:09] <RustIndy> aaronmcadam: demo link added, http://indyarmy.com/awesomeCloud/
[10:02:17] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview
[10:02:35] <Hawkee> faraway, this only triggered when the mouse hovers over the box
[10:02:36] <takkun1946> Deiu: are you hitting your issue with your 'kb' var? you're declaring it twice, once at 62 and again at 82
[10:02:43] <Hawkee> I want a 1 to appear when it hovers over and a 2 to appear when it hovers out
[10:02:45] <Deiu> takkun1946, yeah
[10:02:55] <aaronmcadam> right, it's pure canvas?
[10:02:56] <Deiu> I forgot to comment the first one though
[10:03:01] <aaronmcadam> so u lose the content?
[10:03:08] <Deiu> (reverted back to not using array)
[10:03:10] <aaronmcadam> ah
[10:03:18] <takkun1946> ic ic
[10:03:20] <Hawkee> I appreciate the effort though, thank you
[10:03:20] <aaronmcadam> u just can't select the span text
[10:03:24] <faraway> Hawkee: http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/8/ ?
[10:03:34] <Zzaichik> Hawkee:  http://jsfiddle.net/xNVLY/9/  sorry, I wasn't paying attn
[10:03:47] <Zzaichik> faraway:  did basically the same thing
[10:03:53] <Hawkee> faraway, yes this is what I figured I need to do
[10:03:59] <erebel55> anyone wanna help me debug some errors with jquery ui? http://jsfiddle.net/v83Kt/14/
[10:04:00] <RustIndy> pure canvas, yup
[10:04:00] <Hawkee> thank you Zzaichik
[10:04:03] <Deiu> takkun1946, if I don't use arrays, it looks like the object gets overwritten (not sure how javascript adds content to the page, so that might be a problem too)
[10:04:17] <Hawkee> I thought I might have to do it this way, but I wanted to see if there was a way to do it with .on("hover"
[10:04:24] <faraway> Hawkee: you need to check if you need mousover,mouseout pair or mouseenter, mouseleave
[10:04:29] <Hawkee> I'll just use this
[10:04:35] <Zzaichik> ^^
[10:05:08] <RustIndy> aaronmcadam: i'm still experimenting with ways to add anchors to the text, so this isn't useful as a tag cloud yet. purely visual
[10:05:20] <aaronmcadam> yeh
[10:05:28] <aaronmcadam> apart from the fact that tag clouds are a bit old hat
[10:05:41] <aaronmcadam> and most people still don't realise what they mean
[10:05:52] <faraway> Zzaichik: yeah and i thing the enter,leave is the correct one if there are other elements inside
[10:05:57] <rroelofs> erebel55: just ask.  what's the problem?
[10:05:58] <aaronmcadam> nice project for playing with canvas tho
[10:06:02] <faraway> Zzaichik: think ^^
[10:06:07] <Deiu> takkun1946, if you load the page at http://webid.fcns.eu/lookup/, you can see the contents of kb (in the console.log)
[10:06:15] <Hawkee> this works perfectly, thank you
[10:06:16] <Zzaichik> ;)
[10:06:27] <aaronmcadam> we would need text paths to solve that
[10:06:43] <aaronmcadam> I thought there was some movement on that
[10:06:44] <RustIndy> thanks :) we had a business requirement, so i spent my weekend coding it up. then turned it into a plugin and figured what the heck, let it out :)
[10:06:48] <erebel55> rroelofs: it's telling me Object function has no method 'widget' for some reason..but i'm including widget.js so I don't know what the problem is
[10:07:11] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: do try some jasmine tests tho, you'll thank yourself
[10:07:19] <RustIndy> jasmine tests?
[10:08:24] <takkun1946> Deiu: so your problem is that $('#description').append() isn't being triggered?
[10:08:24] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=6&sqi=2&ved=0CE0QFjAF&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnet.tutsplus.com%2Ftutorials%2Fjavascript-ajax%2Ftesting-your-javascript-with-jasmine%2F&ei=_ApqT7vLGojMtAbkm8jcBw&usg=AFQjCNEekmh8Ha5zEoRorxdchtZo73SgyA
[10:08:35] <faraway> is the $(element).find(" > .some-class")  a correct selector? it works with find, but i don't get wit work with $(element).on("click"," > .some-class",â€¦)
[10:08:39] <Deiu> Yeah, for the first iteration (out of two right now)
[10:08:41] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/testing-your-javascript-with-jasmine/
[10:08:50] <aaronmcadam> http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ @ RustIndy
[10:09:05] <RustIndy> aaronmcadam: already reading up on it :) thanks
[10:09:10] <erebel55> I think i'm including jsquery ui wrong in my example or something. does any have experience with that here?
[10:09:11] <aaronmcadam> http://railscasts.com/episodes/261-testing-javascript-with-jasmine
[10:09:16] <rroelofs> erebel55: the slider seems to be working.  are you sure it isn't just a jsfiddle weirdness?
[10:09:17] <s34n> accordians don't work, tabs don't work, dialogs work. Actual .js file contains all three widgets.
[10:09:20] <Deiu> takkun1946, but looking at the contents of kb, the first kb is weird.
[10:09:53] <rroelofs> erebel55: yes, you don't hve to add the script yourself.  just check the appropriate box on the left
[10:09:55] <Deiu> also, the page always shows contents for the last iteration (no matter how many there are)
[10:10:06] <aaronmcadam> RustIndy: d.me/aaron.mcadam/jasmine
[10:10:47] <erebel55> rroelofs: yeah I know that I can do that and it works. but I wanted to do it myself so that when I move it off of jsfiddle I will know how to do it
[10:10:53] <erebel55> is that dumb?
[10:11:20] <RustIndy> aaronmcadam: ok, you lost me with that last line - what?
[10:11:26] <rroelofs> erebel55: no it isn't dumb, but jsfiddle is ind of specialized that way
[10:11:41] <aaronmcadam> that's a list of links on my delicious to do with jasmine
[10:11:49] <poppiez> hi, I'm trying to scroll to an element inside a div with overflow: auto; height: 600px; doing myParent.animate({ scrollTop: myChild.offset().top }, 200); doesn't seem to cut it. thoughts?
[10:11:57] <RustIndy> ahhh spectacular :) thanks a lot!
[10:12:08] <RustIndy> feel free to create an issue if you want ;)
[10:12:59] <faraway> thats a code snip pen for my problem, wondering if it is a query bug, or if the selector cannot be used that way: http://jsfiddle.net/V8DAP/
[10:13:04] <takkun1946> Deiu: double check your code in your card fn. you're missing quite a few ';'
[10:13:13] <faraway> snippet -.-
[10:13:25] <takkun1946> not sure if it just didn't copy over correctly
[10:13:30] <erebel55> rroelofs: hmm ok, so the way i'm doing it right now looks correct for when I take off of jsfiddle? so i should just use the built in jsfiddle framework fo jsquery ui then
[10:13:50] <rroelofs> erebel55: yes
[10:14:05] <erebel55> ok, thank you rroelofs
[10:15:05] <Deiu> takkun1946, yeah, it's fixed
[10:15:14] <Deiu> but it doesn't help with the main issue
[10:16:48] <takkun1946> i know.. just a second thought while looking through it
[10:17:25] <takkun1946> @82, you're trying to access graphs[docURI], but docURI is an array from your splice in 81
[10:17:49] <takkun1946> so would you want something like kb = docURI[0]?
[10:18:03] <takkun1946> you're not setting graphs to anything really from what I can see
[10:18:29] <Deiu> hmm, you're right
[10:21:18] <Deiu> takkun1946, I thought slice() returns a string, not an array though
[10:25:22] <takkun1946> Deiu: slice() returns an array and is typically meant be be called on an array. I believe substring is what you want .substring(start, stop)
[10:26:17] <Deiu> takkun1946, same results if I replace slice() :)
[10:29:05] <takkun1946> Deiu: right, but what are you trying to set "var kb =" to? are you still using "var kb=graphs[docURI];" ?? because you're still not setting graphs, so whatever is supposed to be mapped in graphs (from what I can see) isn't getting mapped, so it won't return properly
[10:29:29] <Deiu> takkun1946, hold on, let me see
[10:31:51] <Deiu> takkun1946, for some reason, kb doesn't let use docURI unless it's part of an array
[10:33:50] <Deiu> it might be related to $rdf.IndexedFormula()
[10:40:20] <Brunoz> sup guys, is there any gallery with swipe or touch event that parse albums from picasa or flickr?
[10:41:44] <Zzaichik> I don't know of any
[10:42:02] <Brunoz> hmm thanks Zzaichik : s
[10:42:10] <Zzaichik> sorry
[10:42:13] <kibble> jquery mobile has part 1
[10:42:15] <Brunoz> np
[10:42:25] <Hawkee> hmm, how do I save a public fiddle on jsfiddle?
[10:42:38] <Zzaichik> save button
[10:42:44] <Hawkee> yes, I thought that would do it
[10:42:50] <Zzaichik> didn't huh?
[10:42:50] <Hawkee> but my public fiddles page is still blank
[10:42:53] <Zzaichik> hmmm
[10:45:10] <Hawkee> seems like I'm doing everything right
[10:45:24] <Hawkee> clicked create a new fiddle, entered it in, pressed save
[10:45:27] <Hawkee> says it's the base fiddle
[10:45:32] <Hawkee> but my public fiddles is still blank
[10:46:16] <Hawkee> now my dashboard has it listed under "your fiddles"
[10:46:40] <Zzaichik> I think that's what it should do..
[10:46:50] <Hawkee> so what are "public fiddles"?
[10:46:55] <Hawkee> that's what has me confused
[10:47:52] <Zzaichik> Yeah I'm not sure - all fiddles are pretty much public
[10:48:05] <diegoviola> hi
[10:48:20] <diegoviola> can i perform some CSS transformations on a element after the page has finished loading? Any ideas how?
[10:48:24] <diegoviola> thanks
[10:49:25] <Hawkee> I've never actually used jsfiddle with an account, just thought I'd create one to see what they offer
[10:49:58] <xmaddness> diegoviola, sure. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:50:14] <diegoviola> cool thanks
[10:50:56] <Hawkee> jsfiddle has an API, this could be useful
[10:51:40] <rabbi11> which is good light weight jquery gantt chart  ?
[10:53:39] <toddparker> hey all
[10:54:00] <xmaddness> good and light weight don't seem to be a valid combo when concerning gannt charts
[10:54:18] <Brunoz> wsup toddparker
[11:01:54] <Brunoz> Zzaichik:
[11:01:57] <Brunoz> ive found one
[11:02:04] <Brunoz> supersized
[11:02:08] <Brunoz> :)
[11:02:28] <Zzaichik> oh nice! I'll have to check it out. I've just kinda done my own thing
[11:03:05] <Brunoz> yeah, i was about to do
[11:03:18] <Brunoz> but ill use this one for now
[11:03:36] <Brunoz> cos i need to delivery this website till the end of the week
[11:03:40] <Brunoz> :P
[11:04:00] <Zzaichik> :)
[11:04:05] <winterpk> Does anyone know how to pan and zoom to a point on gmap3 without needing to add a marker?
[11:05:50] <rehs> winterpk, Using the jQuery plugin for gmaps3?
[11:06:55] <winterpk> yeah
[11:07:53] <winterpk> @rehs do you have experience with it?
[11:08:17] <rehs> Unfortunetly no, glancing over the API now.
[11:09:39] <rehs> winterpk, Looks like you just need to access the map.zoom param in the gmap3 element.
[11:10:37] <winterpk> it seems like I can only use zoom after I've added something though like a marker, or overlay of some kind.
[11:10:55] <winterpk> and I just want to zoom and center to an arbitrary location
[11:10:59] <rehs> Give me an example of how you are trying to access it.
[11:11:11] <winterpk> ok 1 sec
[11:11:34] <winterpk> this was my last attempt, but I didn't really expect it to work
[11:11:37] <winterpk> $map.gmap3({
[11:11:37] <winterpk>             	action : 'get',
[11:11:37] <winterpk>             	name : 'marker',
[11:11:37] <winterpk>             	map : {
[11:11:37] <winterpk>             		center : true,
[11:11:38] <winterpk>             		zoom : 8,
[11:11:38] <winterpk>             	}
[11:11:38] <winterpk>             });
[11:12:01] <rehs> I don't think you need to access it like that after you have already init'ed it
[11:12:10] * RandalSchwartz wipes the paste from his screen
[11:12:33] <rehs> More like $map.map.zoom = 14;
[11:12:43] <winterpk> ah ok
[11:12:45] <winterpk> let me try
[11:12:52] <rehs> May not work but, after 2 min on the API docs thats how I see it
[11:14:33] <winterpk> hmm no go
[11:15:16] <fisherinnovation> Yeah after looking more I figured haha
[11:15:42] <fisherinnovation> This plugin looks like its kinda missing this feature..
[11:15:57] <fisherinnovation> What if you apss no action in when you run your old code?
[11:16:01] <fisherinnovation> pass*
[11:16:56] <winterpk> @fisherinnovation I think I need an action, but I'll try
[11:17:31] <fisherinnovation> What were you expecting 'get' to do as a supplied action?
[11:17:52] <winterpk> I was hoping to 'get' the markers with that last example
[11:17:57] <winterpk> here's my new attempt though
[11:18:00] <winterpk> $map.gmap3({
[11:18:00] <winterpk>             	options : {
[11:18:00] <winterpk>             		center : [46, 2],
[11:18:00] <winterpk>             		zoom : 5,
[11:18:00] <winterpk>             	}
[11:18:00] <winterpk>             });
[11:18:07] <winterpk> no action
[11:18:18] <fisherinnovation> and..?
[11:18:24] <ajpiano> winterpk: Stop pasting into the channel or you will be banned
[11:18:34] <winterpk> sorry
[11:18:36] <fisherinnovation> use pastebin
[11:18:40] <winterpk> ok
[11:18:47] <winterpk> <- mirc noob
[11:18:59] <fisherinnovation> np - just takes one kick to learn ;)
[11:19:08] <winterpk> no go with no action
[11:19:09] * myrmyron looks up and does not find anything familiar... --> n00b
[11:20:04] <winterpk> any other ideas on an arbitrary zoom and center?
[11:20:09] <myrmyron> someone trying to do naughty things with google maps?
[11:20:26] <winterpk> no just trying to figure out something seemingly simple
[11:21:10] <shadykhan> if i get '$ is not a function' in firebug console does that mean jquery isnt loading right?
[11:21:12] <myrmyron> I'm already glad that I can manhandle .load
[11:21:18] <Brunoz> why use gmap3
[11:21:28] <Brunoz> and not the original gmap plugin?
[11:21:37] <winterpk> supposedly because its easier
[11:21:40] <myrmyron> shadykhan: not loading or loading too late for what you try to do
[11:21:42] <fisherinnovation> heh
[11:21:56] <shadykhan> okay thx myrmyron
[11:22:01] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, What about calling 'init' as the action again..
[11:22:11] <winterpk> good idea!
[11:22:13] <fisherinnovation> Seems retarded - but the docs specifiy nothing better
[11:22:54] <winterpk> didn't work
[11:25:29] <fisherinnovation> lol
[11:25:45] <fisherinnovation> Thats kinda werid.
[11:26:22] <fisherinnovation> Just for validation - call the destroy function on it first then reinit it. Again, its retarded and seems backwards - just trying to get a better sense of what its doing.
[11:27:58] <winterpk> ok
[11:31:56] <i3ooi3oo> I'm trying to recreate a live search that is available online.  I have only modified the lookup page to meet the search I am wanting.  The search page (live.php) returns the data I am searching for yet the page doesn't work. http://pastebin.com/HPeGsYcH <- is both pages.
[11:34:58] <RyanD> Hello, all.
[11:35:05] <RyanD> how do I trim down a window location
[11:35:06] <RyanD> IE
[11:35:15] <RyanD> i have http://mydomain.com/content/verizon-wireless/?preview=1&pageId=1138
[11:35:25] <RyanD> I'm looking to just trim that down to /verizon-wireless
[11:35:31] <RyanD> automatically
[11:35:44] <RyanD> IE, go to the last slash in the URL, grab the words before it, and that's all
[11:35:51] <RyanD> strip out var names, etc.
[11:35:56] <RyanD> *vars after
[11:36:12] <Brodingo> window.location.pathname.split('/')
[11:36:24] <fisherinnovation> RyanD, I would do this serverside..
[11:38:34] <winterpk> @fisher Something weird going on.  After I destroy() gmap3 then I cannot seem to reinit it.  here is my pastebin http://pastebin.com/GTiZ10zK.  I changed the $map var to my actual selector.
[11:39:11] <winterpk> that is the same init options I used initially except zoom is higher
[11:42:22] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?hl=fr#Map
[11:42:27] <ninnypants> I run into an issue when using index() I get two elements with the index of 1 but none with the index of 0 does anyone have any idea why?
[11:42:31] <ninnypants> here's the code https://gist.github.com/2151015
[11:42:45] <ninnypants> and you can see it in action here http://dev.jeffbrandner.com/
[11:42:52] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, you need access to 'setZoom'
[11:43:23] <winterpk> hmm ok
[11:43:26] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, I haven't looked at the course for the gmaps3 plugin - but judging by the docs, I don't think that is utilized.
[11:43:34] <fisherinnovation> source*
[11:43:55] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, Should be easy enough to add to the source.
[11:47:55] <Advocated> anyone else had the issue of jdialog elements not opening in the correct position? it keeps jumping the page to the bottom and so on :S
[11:55:31] <winterpk> @fisherinnovation got it finally
[11:55:49] <fisherinnovation> winterpk, nice! Solution?
[11:56:12] <winterpk> http://pastebin.com/KJTuPR6H
[11:56:18] <winterpk> simple really
[11:56:36] <winterpk> just had to 'get' the map object, then run panTo method
[11:57:10] <fisherinnovation> Ahhhh
[11:57:27] <fisherinnovation> I get it
[11:57:29] <fisherinnovation> Cool
[11:57:36] <fisherinnovation> Noted, for possible use in the future.
[11:57:53] <winterpk> yeah so with that map object I have accesss to all google map stuff
[11:58:04] <fisherinnovation> Cool
[12:05:48] <devmikey> Question: I'm trying to use animate to scroll images across a div.  problem is, that to restart, it has to wait for first run to finish first so there's a gap.  Can I launch the next batch sooner?
[12:06:05] <Advocated> anyone else had the issue of jdialog elements not opening in the correct position? it keeps jumping the page to the bottom and so on :S ive got an example http://jsfiddle.net/vdvZU/  but i can't get it to show where i want. Im trying to get it to show at the bottom of the square boxes.. any ideas please?
[12:12:52] <djayb6> Hello, I would like to do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/XSEtg/ is it possible ?
[12:15:16] <Absolute0> How can I simulate $.post('some_url', {'playlist_json':'foobar'}); with curl?
[12:15:48] <Absolute0> using various variations of -d I can't seem to get that exact same result.
[12:18:29] <fission6> how do i make all elemenbts with abackground property have a background of white
[12:28:16] <Zzaichik> fission6: Seriously? I don't think I quite understand what you're looking for. We're talking CSS? Maybe you could give an example or something.
[12:29:14] <chovy> fission6: can you give them a class name instead?
[12:29:56] <Zzaichik> ^^ That was my first thought. But I'm not sure what he's looking for.
[12:29:56] <Advocated> is there a way to place a jquery dialog inside a div?
[12:30:22] <chovy> $.each($("*"), function(i, x) { if ( $(x).css('background-color') $(x).css('background-color', "#fff") });
[12:31:01] <cybersholt> anybody got a sec to help figure out why my fancy select won't work in IE at all ??? http://jsfiddle.net/rUZm8/
[12:31:10] <chovy> Zzaichik: I think he just wants to change all defined background colors to white.
[12:31:27] <cybersholt> and yes I know IE blowz :)
[12:32:01] <danzik17> $.Widget should properly set up the prototype chain including the constructor property when inheriting from another widget, correct?
[12:33:34] <cybersholt> no one? somebody here has to like fancy selects http://jsfiddle.net/rUZm8/
[12:33:47] <MagePsycho> guys can you help me in listing good testing framework for javascript?
[12:34:03] <chovy> MagePsycho: jsunit?
[12:34:26] <MagePsycho> chovy: is that the most popular one?
[12:36:08] <chovy> MagePsycho: http://fireunit.org/
[12:37:02] <MagePsycho> chovy: jsunit is no longer maintained
[12:40:44] <cybersholt> last call I guess can some 1 help with this http://jsfiddle.net/rUZm8/1/ it works on all but IE
[12:41:38] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do? custom select?
[12:41:52] <cybersholt> yes
[12:42:10] <cybersholt> basically convert it to a ul
[12:42:13] <nail_> Advocated: place as in constrain? http://jsfiddle.net/TnDkM/
[12:43:14] <Advocated> nail, this was my original problem - anyone else had the issue of jdialog elements not opening in the correct position? it keeps jumping the page to the bottom and so on :S ive got an example http://jsfiddle.net/vdvZU/  but i can't get it to show where i want. Im trying to get it to show at the bottom of the square boxes.. any ideas please?
[12:43:51] <Advocated> nail_, also your example, when i load it, the dialog is outside of the div?
[12:45:43] <ravenzz> cybersholt so you want to convert the select into an ul and use the bootstrap dropdown?
[12:45:55] <ravenzz> cybersholt_ so you want to convert the select into an ul and use the bootstrap dropdown?
[12:46:10] <cybersholt_> exactly
[12:46:41] <cybersholt_> it works great on everything else
[12:46:50] <cybersholt_> idk why IE is hatin
[12:48:18] <beepbeep_> http://codepad.org/8nOiedM3 could anyone explain me what parameters "a", "i" & "m" are and why?
[12:50:35] <cybersholt_> any ideas ravenzz ?
[12:51:14] <ravenzz> hold on
[12:51:36] <cybersholt_> thank you I really appreciate it

[13:10:32] <ravenzz> cybersholt_ http://jsfiddle.net/k7StN/
[13:10:41] <ravenzz> I don't know why the data() function is not working
[13:11:09] <cybersholt_> thanks sooo much I'll see what I can do with this 1 :)
[13:11:40] <ravenzz> ah no it works
[13:12:10] <ravenzz> from that one you have the ul you can style easily
[13:12:27] <Advocated> nail_, ?
[13:12:32] <cybersholt_> thanks again!
[13:12:38] <ProLoser|Work> anyone know of a js concat/compression tool?
[13:12:42] <Advocated> Anyone know how to position a jquery dialog inside a <div> ?
[13:13:06] <djayb6> ProLoser|Work use uglify
[13:13:07] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: there are many, do you have a particular toolset you're already using?
[13:13:12] <ProLoser|Work> no
[13:13:19] <ProLoser|Work> quick n peasy
[13:13:22] <taipres> Advocated position how?
[13:13:29] <taipres> you can use css to display however you want
[13:13:50] <johnkpaul> ProLoser|Work: pure js?
[13:13:54] <ProLoser|Work> yes
[13:13:55] <johnkpaul> there's the closure compiler
[13:13:58] <ProLoser|Work> i saw one somewhere
[13:14:01] <johnkpaul> oh ok, then  uglify is the only one I know as well
[13:14:05] <ProLoser|Work> it needs to be client-side
[13:14:12] <johnkpaul> oh
[13:14:16] <johnkpaul> ? that's not what I thought yo umeant
[13:14:16] <Advocated> taipres, i want to load a dialog() but inside/position inside my div
[13:14:17] <bot-t> johnkpaul, Couldn't find "that's not what I thought yo umeant" in jQuery Docs.
[13:14:26] <johnkpaul> you want to compress your javascript in a browser?
[13:14:29] <johnkpaul> rather than beforehand?
[13:14:35] <i3ooi3oo> johnkpaul: Thought that was that the $(#result... was
[13:14:36] <ProLoser|Work> it's a package builder
[13:14:42] <ProLoser|Work> like that minified page
[13:14:45] <ProLoser|Work> or whatever it's called
[13:14:49] <ProLoser|Work> i know i saw one on someone's project page
[13:14:52] <ProLoser|Work> and he said you can use his code
[13:14:53] <johnkpaul> requirejs?
[13:14:59] <ProLoser|Work> no
[13:15:00] <ProLoser|Work> dude
[13:15:05] <ProLoser|Work> i'm making a downloadable js file
[13:15:10] <ProLoser|Work> that the person includes in their page
[13:15:11] <johnkpaul> minifier?
[13:15:14] <ProLoser|Work> ?
[13:15:15] <johnkpaul> douglas crockford's packer?
[13:15:24] <NoiseEee> hey now, thats personal
[13:15:31] <johnkpaul> :)
[13:15:48] <johnkpaul> i3ooi3oo: after function(data)
[13:15:53] <johnkpaul> you don't have an {
[13:16:00] <johnkpaul> so it's a syntax error
[13:16:02] <ProLoser|Work> like this: http://www.modernizr.com/download/
[13:16:08] <mts7> Advocated: if you figure it out, please let me know.  :-)
[13:16:25] <i3ooi3oo> Added that, still doesn't send anything to the live.php
[13:16:29] <Advocated> mts7, been trying for ages, all the ideas dont appear to work
[13:16:59] <mts7> Yeah, I've noticed that...
[13:18:46] <johnkpaul> i3ooi3oo: are you looking in your console
[13:18:48] <i3ooi3oo> johnkpaul: Okay I realize the demo I was watching didn't show it.  I have since added yet it still doesn't work
[13:21:23] <i3ooi3oo> johnkpaul: it's telling me getNames not defined
[13:21:33] <johnkpaul> so where do you define getnames?
[13:24:09] <i3ooi3oo> I guess I haven't , very new to jquery, I thought defining the function in the script handled that
[13:27:27] <a-l-e> hi... i'm writing page showing the program for a conference and i'm wondering if there is a jquery plugin or code around to show the slots as rectangles...
[13:28:10] <a-l-e> a bit like calendar apps do... but i don't need any interactivity: the data comes out of the DB and does not have to be edited there
[13:28:42] <kibble> to what slots are you refering?
[13:29:29] <a-l-e> on the 2nd of may at 9:00 a conference start and lasts 30 minutes...
[13:29:32] <guy> Using jQuery-UI draggable I am trying to catch the element being dragged. start: function() { console.log( $('.ui-draggable-dragging') );
[13:29:44] <a-l-e> at 9:30 a second talk... 30 min again
[13:29:47] <guy> This doesn't work. What should I look for?
[13:29:57] <a-l-e> leave 15 empty for the coffee break...
[13:29:59] <a-l-e> and so on...
[13:30:15] <a-l-e> there could be two slots in parallel (most of all if there is an error)
[13:30:33] <a-l-e> http://www.queness.com/resources/images/calendar/c4.gif
[13:30:37] <kibble> a-l-e: this all sounds like css to me
[13:31:17] <a-l-e> well, kibble, yes it's css... but i think that having some js calculating the length of the slots would help :-)
[13:31:28] <kibble> if it's not interactive then why not get your backend to do it
[13:32:07] <a-l-e> yes, but then i have to program everything from scratch... but i guess that dozen of pople have already solved the same problem...
[13:32:26] <a-l-e> clearly, i will do it from scratch if i don't find anyhting...
[13:32:44] * kibble shrugs
[13:32:54] <a-l-e> i'm looking at https://github.com/themouette/jquery-week-calendar
[13:33:03] <kibble> I would just written it from scratch anyway, would take too long to modify other code
[13:33:56] <a-l-e> yep, it works!
[13:34:11] <a-l-e> now, i have to see if i can show custom days...
[13:34:16] <a-l-e> http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html
[13:34:23] <a-l-e> ok, maybe i've found a solution :-)
[13:36:02] <Advocated> How do i go about appending a jquery dialog to a <div> ?
[13:36:36] <kibble> Advocated: a dialog floats on it's own, are you asking how to attach the floating dialog to a div?
[13:37:16] <Advocated> kibble, ive got a <div id="test"></div> and basically I want my div to load/show in that div container only/be contained to that element, been trying for hours and can't find a way
[13:37:57] <kibble> Advocated: oh so constrain a div dialog inside of another div?
[13:39:17] <Advocated> kibble, well, at the moment this is just the js: http://jsfiddle.net/Z55La/  ive tried appending to it etc, but nothing.. any suggestions?
[13:39:36] <Advocated> i just want it to be contained within a div i specify, thats it
[13:40:31] <i3ooi3oo> johnkpaul: can you point me to instruction on defineing a function
[13:41:06] <kibble> i3ooi3oo: function foo() { do stuff; return false; }
[13:41:40] <kibble> i3ooi3oo: or var foo = function(var1, var2) { do stuff; return true; }
[13:42:17] <kibble> Advocated: where is your dialog init and some markup
[13:42:31] <Advocated> sec
[13:43:21] <kibble> and just off topic why do you have a switch statement inside the even handler when you can only have one event anyway
[13:43:57] <kibble> IE the way it is written you can toss the switch all together
[13:44:00] <Advocated> kibble, ive got additional code to go in there eventually
[13:45:07] <dsyme> http://scrp.at/beR why does this not work?
[13:45:09] <Advocated> kibble,  http://jsfiddle.net/Z55La/2/  here is an updated bit of code, the dialog init, and the divs etc, im trying to display the pt dialog in the column1, and the client dialog in the column2
[13:45:18] <a-l-e> ok, i'll do it myself... have to invest some time in planning :-(
[13:45:24] <dsyme> specifically the .addClass() part
[13:46:34] <kibble> Advocated: you've lost me then, do you want one inside the other or them side by side?
[13:47:56] <Advocated> kibble, imagine a 2row by 2 col div. the top 3 divs contain images, and onmouseover i want each dialog to show in its own div,does that make any sense? so the dialog should load, but load inside the column_bottom1
[13:48:10] <Advocated> and the pt in column_bottom2
[13:48:26] <kibble> oh I see there are two of them each limited in movement to their own columns.
[13:49:19] <kibble> yeah I can probably figure it out eventually but at the present I'm not sure how it's done.  I was under the impression that dialog attached itself to the body and you couldn't limit it's movement
[13:49:55] <Advocated> kibble, ive tried various positionings but then i open one, and then open another and they jump around etc :S
[13:50:07] <Advocated> i cant think how else to do it?
[13:51:11] <kibble> I probably would have used the draggable elements because I know they can be constrained but then I don't have a grasp on your end game either
[13:51:31] <guy> Using jQuery-UI draggable I am trying to catch the element being dragged. start: function() { console.log( $('.ui-draggable-dragging') );
[13:51:35] <guy> This doesn't work. What should I look for?
[13:51:53] <Advocated> kibble, can you constrain draggable inside a div though?
[13:52:04] <kibble> Advocated: from the demos yes
[13:52:29] <eddiemonge> guy: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#events
[13:52:34] <Advocated> kibble, someone did this example for me http://jsfiddle.net/TnDkM/1/  but if you look, when you load it, its outside the div, when you drag it inside *then its constained?
[13:52:38] <guy> eddiemonge: yeah, and?
[13:52:43] <kibble> Advocated: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#constrain-movement
[13:52:45] <eddiemonge> guy: did you read it?
[13:52:49] <guy> Yes.
[13:53:06] <eddiemonge> guy: look at the example in the start method and compare it with yours
[13:53:27] <guy>  start: function(event, ui) { ... }
[13:53:30] <guy> yeah.. and?
[13:53:41] <eddiemonge> guy: what was missing from your code?
[13:54:23] <guy> I've checked event and ui. None variable contains reference to the draggable objct, afaict
[13:54:29] <kibble> Advocated: http://jsfiddle.net/TnDkM/4/
[13:55:02] <kibble> Advocated: of course it's almost sticky or laggy when dragging
[13:55:09] <eddiemonge> guy: start: function(e, ui) { console.log( e, ui ); }
[13:55:19] <guy> yeah, I did that.
[13:55:35] <FLeiXiuS> Is it possible to click an simulate a click event with jquery?
[13:55:58] <Advocated> kibble, what did you change?
[13:56:09] <kibble> Advocated: I didn't know the parent element had containment so it has nothing to do with the dialog
[13:56:18] <kibble> Advocated: just added a position in the dialog init
[13:57:06] <guy> event.currentTarget and ui.helper both refer to the element that was taken, but not to the element that's being dragged.
[13:57:47] <eddiemonge> element that was taken?
[13:58:01] <kibble> that would be a good movie
[13:58:31] <kibble> "I tell you the element was taken!" "Which element was that?" "Gold!"
[13:58:44] <kibble> AU gimme back my gold
[13:59:07] <kibble> course not with dialog like that
[13:59:36] <Advocated> kibble, this still isn't working with my example, god knows whats going on with it
[13:59:51] <eddiemonge> guy: what are you trying to find here: http://jsfiddle.net/rrerV/
[14:00:38] <johnkpaul> ?learn @i3ooi3oo
[14:00:38] <bot-t> i3ooi3oo, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:01:10] <kibble> Advocated: it's that example was autoopen so did recall reading that dialog sometimes tries to attach to the body if it's destroyed and created again
[14:02:25] <Advocated> kibble, how can i get around that then, as it needs to swap dialogs based on whichever icon is used if you get me
[14:02:38] <eddiemonge> guy: http://jsfiddle.net/rrerV/1/
[14:03:49] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/PBpWj/ my tooltips after a little help with the positioning (mine kept going offcenter of the parent container by a little bit)
[14:04:11] <someprimetime> aside from not taking into account the window constraint, i think it'll work as a first pass
[14:05:07] <guy> ui.helper was the selector I was after after all. What confused me is that since draggable element didn't have width or height set, firebug would gray it out
[14:06:06] <eddiemonge> someprimetime: by window constraint, do you mean the first tooltop is partially offscreen?
[14:06:15] <someprimetime> eddiemonge: yep
[14:07:14] <someprimetime> i guess i'll just see if half the width of the tooltip being generated is > the left position of the screen (same for right)
[14:08:21] <eddiemonge> guy: you know ui.helper is the same as e.currentTarget right? usually
[14:08:40] <guy> Could be. The same explanation applies.
[14:11:07] <eddiemonge> do you understand now the correct way to grab the element?
[14:11:20] <Advocated> im trying this: $('#columns_bottom2').append($('#client').html());  which works fine, but how can i clear that div first before appending to it? i tried empty() but then it doesn't evne add client to the other div
[14:12:38] <eddiemonge> Advocated: how did you try to do empty?
[14:12:52] <Advocated> $('#columns_bottom2').empty();
[14:13:01] <Advocated> before the append line
[14:13:36] <eddiemonge> Advocated: that should work to empty it. why not chain them?
[14:14:05] <Advocated> well, it doesn't appear to add it though, or empty it :S
[14:17:36] <luke--_> hi
[14:20:10] <Advocated> eddiemonge, this is what im trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/8qaac/1/ so when they hover over client, it shows in the bottom left box, and then the same for pt and right box, and remove it first. any suggestions?
[14:21:53] <luke--_> is it possible to check if a click has been triggered on an element (also on its children) or if that click has not triggered on that element (or it's children)
[14:23:50] <eddiemonge> luke--_: set a variable with false as the starting value and then on click change it to true. then check that val
[14:24:09] <eddiemonge> Advocated: im slightly confused
[14:24:57] <luke--_> eddiemonge: um, how do I know when to set it to true and when to false?
[14:25:02] <Advocated> eddiemonge, basically, when you hover over the top left div, i want a div to show inside the bottom left. and when you hover over the top right, i want the other div to show inside the bottom right div, get me?
[14:26:02] <guy> https://gist.github.com/593c5c6c47060d4840ca
[14:26:22] <guy> can anyone explain me how the f. can response be undefined?
[14:27:11] <guy> ....
[14:27:17] <guy> ignore
[14:28:29] <eddiemonge> luke--_: when you click, you set it to true. you dont need to set it to false unless you want to
[14:28:40] <Faryshta> guy, you don't have any url defined.
[14:28:47] <eddiemonge> Advocated: why not use show and hide?
[14:29:01] <guy> I don't need to. It defaults to self.
[14:29:32] <Faryshta> guy, are you running it locally? on file:///
[14:29:36] <eddiemonge> guy: is it because your success function is in data instead of being part of its options?
[14:29:40] <guy> eh. no.
[14:30:00] <guy> eddiemonge: I've already niticed that, but thank you
[14:30:14] <guy> noticed*
[14:30:38] <eddiemonge> so this is what you have? http://jsbin.com/ikeniy/edit
[14:30:45] <luke--_> eddiemonge: but I need to find out what element has been clicked. Or to be precise I must fund out if the element that has been clicked has the class "section" or is child of that element. And I must find out if it is not. how do I register event handlers that react on any click and tell me what element has been clicked
[14:31:08] <Advocated> eddiemonge, show and hide instead of append?
[14:31:19] <eddiemonge> luke--_: thats a completely different question. your first question was how can i tell if something has been clicked already or not
[14:31:22] <eddiemonge> Advocated: yeah
[14:31:48] <luke--_> eddiemonge: well however, I meant what I wrote now
[14:32:03] <Manvaril> Hey Quicksilver
[14:32:38] <Advocated> eddiemonge, ok, will give that a bash, cheers
[14:33:10] <Faryshta> luke--_, lets say you have this html: <html><body><div class="section"><span><b>Click</b></span></div></body></html>
[14:33:21] <rodrigovieira> hi everyone
[14:33:25] <Faryshta> luke--_, then you click on the bold 'Click' text.
[14:33:28] <rodrigovieira> I'm thinking about creating a jQuery plugin
[14:33:42] <rodrigovieira> but I want the main function of my plugin to be called like
[14:33:53] <Faryshta> luke--_, The javasript send a click event for all the elements.
[14:33:57] <rodrigovieira> jQuery.function_name()
[14:34:00] <eddiemonge> luke--_: what are you trying to do with that information?
[14:34:11] <rodrigovieira> and not to be bound to the element selection
[14:34:26] <rodrigovieira> like $("#an_id").function_name()
[14:34:35] <rodrigovieira> How do I define such a function?
[14:34:43] <eddiemonge> that is bound to an element selection
[14:36:31] <rodrigovieira> hmm
[14:38:02] <rodrigovieira> but I can call jQuery.ajax without passing any element to it
[14:38:14] <rodrigovieira> I mean, like in the example, in the jQuery Docs site
[14:38:19] <rodrigovieira> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:38:24] <luke--_> Faryshta: ok with jqery I can find out if a .section or its children have been klicked by simply watching click on .section But how do I find out if .section has *not* been klicked?
[14:38:53] <eddiemonge> rodrigovieira: so then you want $.function_name() and not $("#an_id").function_name() right?
[14:39:10] <rodrigovieira> eddiemonge: exactly :)
[14:39:21] <luke--_> eddiemonge: I want to show/hide something (and do other stuff) if the user as 'activated' oder 'deactivated' a .section by clicking inside or outside of it
[14:39:28] <Faryshta> luke--_, if a child is clicked then all of its parent are clicked too.
[14:39:43] <Faryshta> For example. Body is always clicked.
[14:40:13] <eddiemonge> rodrigovieira: $.function_name = function() {};
[14:40:26] <rodrigovieira> eddiemonge: thanks!
[14:42:49] <luke--_> Faryshta: right. I got that now. so I can use $('.section').cliick to catch all clicks on section and its children. But How do you catch clicks NOT performed on sections?
[14:43:15] <quicksilver> Manvaril: hey, glad you got it working.
[14:43:34] <quicksilver> Manvaril: .live() is indeed another soluttion and I'm glad it works for you. I still wouldn't delete and re-add elements though :)
[14:43:47] <rroelofs> luke--_: have you looked at event.target?
[14:44:11] <Faryshta> $("body *").not(".section").click();
[14:44:36] <guy>  $(this).position(), $(this).offset(), $(this).css('left'): the CSS method returns 154.3px, but the others to return {x:0,y:0}
[14:44:44] <guy> any clue?
[14:45:02] <guy> but the other two*
[14:45:03] <luke--_> rroelofs: Not yet. I hoped there would be a jquery solution so I won't have to care about browser inconsistencies that naturally come with native JS
[14:45:36] <Faryshta> guy, do you have position defined? I mean not static but fixed, relative or absolute.
[14:45:44] <guy> absolute
[14:45:56] <Faryshta> guy, can you paste the code?
[14:46:08] <guy> There is a lot of code...
[14:46:10] <luke--_> Faryshta: Seems like that would work, but this also would invoke like a million observers, which sucks performance-wise
[14:46:11] <rroelofs> luke--_:  you can individually target each thing you are interested in and stopPropagation so the section click function only runs when you want it to
[14:46:37] <eddiemonge> guy: is the parent relative or absolute?
[14:46:48] <guy> relative
[14:47:12] <Faryshta> luke--_, then modify the "body *" for something else.
[14:47:16] <eddiemonge> luke--_: $(document.body).on('click')
[14:47:29] <rroelofs> luke--_:  that doesn't have to be true you can attach the event handlers to the parent and have them filter for the stuff you are interested in.
[14:48:37] <eddiemonge> guy: position and offset should not be 0, 0. is the element in the top left corner of the window?
[14:48:42] <rroelofs> luke--_:  something like $(parent).on("click", "selectorforthingIWant", ...)
[14:49:08] <guy> eddiemonge: nop. I can see it positioned relative to the parent container
[14:49:41] <guy> $('.page-four .picture-preview .clone').each(function(e) { console.log( $(this).position() ); } div class="image ui-draggable clone ui-resizable" data-image="2" style="position: absolute; opacity: 1; z-index: 18; left: 161.5px; top: 66px; background-color: transparent;">
[14:49:47] <eddiemonge> guy: then something else is going on because those shouldnt be 0,0
[14:50:01] <guy> That's the selection and the elelment itself.
[14:50:39] <eddiemonge> that selection doesnt match that element
[14:50:50] <luke--_> Faryshta: I'd still be stuck with monitoring every element. rroelofs : same issue; I'd have to monitor every non-section element. eddiemonge then what, I'd monitor the body element and all its children. that always fires and I still can't see what element has been clicked
[14:51:20] <Faryshta> luke--_, I don't get your problem.
[14:51:33] <guy> eddiemonge: It does obviously, since I get the CSS property.
[14:51:42] <eddiemonge> luke--_: you are asking to monitor if .section is clicked or anything else is clicked that isnt .section
[14:52:00] <eddiemonge> guy: this is where a demo would be handy
[14:52:22] <rroelofs> luke--_: putting together a fiddle would help us know what you really need.
[14:52:23] <PPPaul> is there a way to overwrite all of the HTML in my document with a string?
[14:52:30] <guy> Let me start with video demo as it is a bit tricky to reproduce it.
[14:52:52] <eddiemonge> PPPaul: why?
[14:52:53] <rroelofs> PPPaul: $("body").html("") :-)
[14:53:04] <PPPaul> there is still <head></head>
[14:53:41] <rroelofs> PPPaul:  I'm with eddiemonge , Why??
[14:53:41] <PPPaul> i want to overwrite everything
[14:53:54] <PPPaul> i want to produce a file and serve it to my client
[14:54:12] <PPPaul> the file doesn't exist on the db, though... made on the browser only
[14:54:36] <guy> oh wow...
[14:54:42] <guy> I caught the bug.
[14:54:46] <jaequery> anyone can make a sense out of this? http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs
[14:55:16] <jaequery> from the markups they have, why do they give out examples such as,  $('#myTab').tab('show'),  and $('.tabs a:last').tab('show')
[14:55:30] <jaequery> their markup has nothing of #myTab nor .tabs
[14:55:38] <guy> eddiemonge: That was a tough one and foolish as well. https://gist.github.com/7f437b4c82ef0cd8f5c6
[14:56:00] <guy> Parent element was hidden just before .position()
[14:56:15] <guy> that also explains why CSS approach worked.
[14:56:17] <jaequery> i like bootstrap but the guys whose implementing jquery seems to break all logic for a simple tabs implementation
[14:56:43] <eddiemonge> guy: i was going to ask you to inspect that element but thought you would have done that already ;)
[14:56:50] <neybar> given a list of element I want to click them all ex: $('button').trigger('click'), but I want to be able to click them in sync.  So that each element is only clicked after the one before it is completely done (they are making ajax calls)
[14:57:18] <eddiemonge> jaequery: i try to not look at their JS bootstrap since it bastardized jqueryui and did it horribly as well
[14:57:45] <jaequery> eddiemonge: thx, atleast i know im not the crazy one :/
[14:58:04] <eddiemonge> neybar: add the click in the callback. function() if ( element ) { element.click() })
[14:58:14] <jaequery> i dont even understand whats the deal with their no colon policy
[14:59:16] <luke--_> I want to see if a click happened inside a .section or outside, but observing every element on the page  individually (ie. invoking 500 individual observers) I think would suck in terms of performance. I hoped there would be a jquery soluition to check if a click has been triggered but not on that element. like $('.section').notclicked() that is easy to use and doesn't require lots of observers. BUT I just found a solution:
[14:59:16] <luke--_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/152975/how-to-detect-a-click-outside-an-element
[14:59:17] <eddiemonge> jaequery: they look to promote whatever the heck they want
[14:59:40] <eddiemonge> like their commas at the beginning of a line
[14:59:55] <luke--_> But thatnks eddiemonge, rroelofs, Faryshta for your help
[15:00:05] <jaequery> rediculous
[15:00:20] <eddiemonge> luke--_: thats exactly the same thing we said
[15:00:56] <luke--_> except for the stopPropagation. without that it will always trigger, that was the missing piece
[15:01:22] <superdmp> my lightbox: http://v029.medcn.uwcm.ac.uk:8000/imagetest/ doesn't work in IE6-8
[15:01:23] <eddiemonge> luke--_: it still is always going to trigger
[15:01:30] <superdmp> is it immediately obvious what is going wrong?
[15:01:40] <eddiemonge> you are still listening for a click on every element
[15:01:41] <superdmp> when selecting one of the images in the set, the lightbox should pop up
[15:01:57] <eddiemonge> superdmp: quick answer?
[15:02:04] <superdmp> any answer!
[15:02:14] <eddiemonge> its IE 6-8
[15:02:30] <superdmp> i know, i know, i know
[15:02:34] <superdmp> how I loathe IE
[15:02:48] <luke--_> eddiemonge: Ok I got that wrong. thanks for your patience and your efforts
[15:02:50] <superdmp> I have to run VirtualBox and redo all my work all the time because of IE
[15:03:27] <superdmp> unfortunately, since IE (7, yes really) is my institution's default browser, I am going to have to find a way to make it work
[15:03:31] <superdmp> or give up on it
[15:03:51] <ravenzz> superdmp 1st of all I'd try to include jquery 1.7.1
[15:04:25] <superdmp> proviamo
[15:05:21] <superdmp> sadly, that is not the answer
[15:05:38] <eddiemonge> superdmp: any reason you are using 1.6?
[15:06:06] <superdmp> eddiemonge: I'm using 1.7.1 now as ravenzz  suggested
[15:07:03] <eddiemonge> is fancybox supported in ie6?
[15:07:09] <MrBoss7> hey
[15:07:25] <superdmp> eddiemonge:  yes, it works nicely (amazingly)
[15:07:35] <superdmp> but I have modified it a bit
[15:07:37] <MrBoss7> I have a sortable list and a placeholder. I'd like to show dynamically a text "Drop here ..." in the placeholder. What event do I need to exactly do that one? thx
[15:07:41] <eddiemonge> i thought you said it doesnt work
[15:08:45] <superdmp> eddiemonge:  what I have changed, and what doesn't work, is to load the lightbox html fragment as a resource served up separately by the server, rather than putting the html into the main page
[15:08:50] <superdmp> the reason is economy
[15:08:58] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: use the placeholder option. in your CSS use :Before or :after to add the string
[15:09:04] <WasserDragoon> hey i checked out the grunt branch of jquery-ui from github
[15:09:05] <saimon69> greetings
[15:09:13] <WasserDragoon> but grunt can't find the default task
[15:09:20] <eddiemonge> superdmp: so what part doesnt work then?
[15:09:20] <superdmp> otherwise, the visitor could be loading a dozen large images just by looking at the page
[15:09:34] <MrBoss7> eddiemonge, wouldnt it be better to use jquery because of IE fuckup?
[15:09:44] <superdmp> the images, when selected by the visitor, don't open the lightbox
[15:09:52] <WasserDragoon> anyone here with the same issue and can help me fixing this?
[15:10:13] <saimon69> i am writing a custom  quiz engine in jquery but stumbled in a function that crashes firefox when i try to use onclick on a list element to check a radio button
[15:10:43] <saimon69> and returned an 'object does not support this property or method in ie8'
[15:11:32] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: you could but itll be more work
[15:11:44] <saimon69> the fiddle is here: http://jsfiddle.net/ReTjf/2/ it crashes my firefox 10.0.2 if i click on the text of the question instead of the radio button
[15:11:44] <socialhapy> â˜… Tweet from jquery: jQuery 1.7.2 Released! http://t.co/F3Mw9H2V â˜… http://bit.ly/GDPTq4
[15:12:00] <MrBoss7> eddiemonge, I just need to know what event sortable fires when moving around the "placeholder" :)
[15:13:46] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: you would need to override the _createPlaceholder function
[15:14:47] <jaapbadlands> If anyone is interested, I'm developing an open source plugin for building one-page interfaces which let you issue 'commands' for interaction between your dom and you RESTful API https://github.com/deadlysyntax/molecule.js
[15:14:52] <MrBoss7> eddiemonge, ok then I do :after - works perfectly in chrome
[15:14:55] <MrBoss7> thanks a lot
[15:15:28] <ravenzz> superdmp so you are running a mod of fancybox?
[15:15:48] <superdmp> ravenzz:  not really, just a very small change to the html template
[15:16:28] <superdmp> ravenzz:  by default, the href of the link is an id in the same page; that works (it is loaded into the lightbox in IE)
[15:16:46] <superdmp> my version: the link is to an html fragment that I serve up as required
[15:16:57] * superdmp works fine in other browsers, naturally
[15:18:08] <ravenzz> what is the purpose of such customization?
[15:18:16] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: this will get shot down but https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/615
[15:18:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by eddiemonge (29.476s ago): Add custom content to placeholder
[15:18:22] <MrBoss7> I have a select and I'd like to bind it when an event changes. I could use .change but when someone uses the arrow keys in order to change the state it does not fire. So is there a way to catch this one too?
[15:18:27] <MrBoss7> eddiemonge: thx!!!!!!
[15:18:33] <MrBoss7> ;-) will try that out
[15:18:56] <kedarm> Is it possible to autoscroll the window such that an element matching a particular selector is visible?
[15:19:13] <superdmp> ravenzz:  if I included each html fragment in the page, then it could potentially load a dozen or more large images, even if the user is not interested in them
[15:19:47] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: select with arrow isnt a change until the select is blurred
[15:20:00] <eddiemonge> kedarm: link a page anchor?
[15:20:08] <MrBoss7> eddiemonge, can't I somehow "live update"?
[15:20:17] <superdmp> ravenzz:  by having them as a separately served-up fragment only when required, it is more economical
[15:20:25] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: not reliably unless you have a faux-select
[15:20:37] <eddiemonge> MrBoss7: myabe try binding to keypress as well although i have never tried that
[15:20:52] <kedarm> eddiemonge: that's an idea. Let me play with it. Thank you.
[15:20:53] <MrBoss7> keyup?
[15:21:05] <ravenzz> couldn't you populate your DOM with links to the images and load them on scroll?
[15:21:41] <superdmp> ravenzz:  why on scroll?
[15:23:36] <ravenzz> this way you can pre-load images and show them when the user scrolls vertically
[15:24:16] <ravenzz> anyway this is not related to your issue
[15:25:26] <fission6> how do i get the full html <a href> .... </a> of the first element of a $('a')
[15:25:53] <ravenzz> i'd move the google analytics code to the bottom of the page
[15:26:01] <kibble> fission6: .html()?
[15:26:09] <kibble> oh no wait that's like innerHTML
[15:26:17] <eddiemonge> ?outerhtml @ fission6
[15:26:17] <bot-t> fission6, jQuery Snippets: outerHTML - .. returns the HTML that composes the whole element, unlike innerHTML which returns the HTML that composes of what is inside the element. http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2007/06/17/jquery-snippets-outerhtml/
[15:26:40] <fission6> thanks
[15:26:46] <eddiemonge> fission6: or else $('a')[0]
[15:27:06] <fission6> thanks
[15:28:39] <NoReGreT> can someone help here please http://pastie.org/3644276 the issue is described at the end
[15:29:12] <ravenzz> hey gnarf, did you saw my pm?
[15:30:56] <kedarm> eddiemonge, you just left, but thanks for the hint!
[15:32:31] <superdmp> ravenzz:  here is a very simplified version of what I am doing: http://jsfiddle.net/QYY8Q/5/ - an weirdly, this works in IE6, at least in jsfiddle
[15:32:49] <superdmp> ("works" means that clicking on the image opens up the larger version)
[15:34:29] <ert3> hey guys is there an indented form of jquery
[15:34:36] <ert3> my boss needs me to figure out what she did wrong i figured that would help
[15:34:40] <ert3> or at least be comforting
[15:35:20] <ravenzz> superdmp I can't try it in IE6, but in IE7/8
[15:35:40] <superdmp> IE7 and 8 were not working either
[15:42:48] <fission6> is there a way to take html returned from $get for instance and use jquery selectors on it, or do i have to append it to the dom first?
[15:42:48] <RachelR> Anyone in a mood to help me debug? O:)
[15:42:55] <RachelR> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/uncaught-typeerror-object-object-object-has-no-method-listview-dynamic-lists#14737000003172417
[15:43:25] <RachelR> Most recent post is current code.  I do not think pageinit is even firing or it's failing on calling the JSON.  No clue why.
[15:51:11] <jaapbadlands> fission6: in your success callback you should be able to place the data variable within $( ) to turn it into a jquery object
[15:52:33] <fission6> ok
[15:52:36] <fission6> thanks
[15:55:30] <jaapbadlands> fission6: it's the same way that you can put any html within $( ) to turn it into a jQ object such as $('<div></div>').appendTo('#element')
[15:55:46] <jaapbadlands> which would place the empty div within the specified #element
[15:57:00] <jaapbadlands> RachelR I haven't read your whole post but I think I see something wrong with $("#projList").append('<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true"</ul>');
[15:57:46] <RachelR> Hm, what do you see causing issues with that line?
[15:57:51] <jaapbadlands> ahh I see you've changed it since then
[15:57:57] <jaapbadlands> there is a missing >
[15:58:02] <_zoggy_> need to update topic, 1.7.2 is out
[15:58:11] <jaapbadlands> after data-filter="true"
[15:58:16] <RachelR> ah yes, I see that
[15:58:42] <RachelR> yes, I changed the code and tried to make it so it was adding just individual <li> instead of a completely new list
[15:59:28] <RachelR> Unfortunately, I can't determine where the code is failing.  I'm getting some "call to OpenGL..
[15:59:44] <RachelR> error
[16:00:09] <jaapbadlands> Did you google that error? I googled "call to OpenGL ES API with no current context (logged once per thread)" and came across this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3508348/why-am-i-getting-call-to-opengl-es-api-with-no-current-context, might help, might not
[16:00:22] <jaapbadlands> worth a look though I guess
[16:02:27] <RachelR> yeah but I'm not even aware of where I'm calling openGL - it's just a simple HTML page w/ javascript
[16:02:38] <RachelR> thx for the link though
[16:03:07] <jaapbadlands> do you have control of the server-side code - the ai?
[16:03:10] <jaapbadlands> api?
[16:03:46] <RachelR> yes
[16:04:41] <NoReGreT> how can I check if a string is empty ?
[16:08:25] <RachelR> Ah I got it, needed to remove a reference to jquery I had in there
[16:11:15] <MrBoss7> How can I select first children of a li, like <li><input type.... I'd like to extract the classname
[16:11:29] <MrBoss7> I have in a var the <li><input ....</li>
[16:11:32] <MrBoss7> somehow it does not work
[16:11:36] <MrBoss7> I've fetched it before using .load
[16:11:42] <MrBoss7> $('li').load....
[16:12:00] <MrBoss7> I tried $('li').find(':first').attr('class')
[16:12:39] <jaapbadlands> NoReGreT:  if( string == "" )
[16:13:33] <juho3> How do I trigger an event to launch after some event has finished? (more precisely dragstop)
[16:14:07] <jaapbadlands> MrBoss7, do you need to do it to every li in the dom?
[16:14:38] <MrBoss7> Nah... I have a string: <li><input type="text" class="here-the-class" /></li>
[16:14:49] <MrBoss7> and I want to extract the class-attr
[16:15:16] <jaapbadlands> so you need to first select the one particular <li>
[16:15:48] <jaapbadlands> that you want, if you try $('<li>') you are selecting every list item on the page
[16:18:20] <jaapbadlands> once you have selected to specific <li> you want then you could go $('li.class').children('input').attr('class')
[16:18:50] <asidjazz> your mom coudl go
[16:18:54] <asidjazz> you
[16:19:39] <juho3> How am I supposed to bind something to dragstop? Seems like $("selector").bind("dragstop", StopHandler); doesn't trigger StopHandler
[16:19:56] <juho3> I want StopHandler to be triggered AFTER dragstop
[16:20:38] <juho3> help would be much appreciated, been wrestling with this simple problem for quite some time
[16:37:02] <badbandit> anyone know why a jquery UI effect would not work the first time but work after that? particularly I added a delay to a .addClass in a click function, it doesnt not run the first click, but does after that
[16:39:31] <J____> good day, would anyone mind explaining the roles of a front end developer, front end designer and information architech. Aren't they very similar if not one in the same?
[16:39:49] <J____> frotn developer = front end engineer?
[16:41:53] <J____> #web
[16:42:29] <coldhead> J____: they are all just invented words that some organisations find useful when mapping roles
[16:42:34] <coldhead> the map is not the territory
[16:42:37] <coldhead> the name is not the thing
[16:42:50] <coldhead> in the end, everyone has to work hard fighting internet explorer quirks
[16:42:55] <coldhead> the client is unsatisfied
[16:43:00] <coldhead> your wife leaves you
[16:43:08] <coldhead> a drinking problem ensues
[16:43:18] <queryforu> coldhead?
[16:43:18] <BinaryKitten> and then you have to suffer your 1st day with jQuery in this channel
[16:43:21] <coldhead> is this really the highest ambitions our childhood selves had for our futures?
[16:44:10] <coldhead> and on other days it just rains
[16:44:13] <BinaryKitten> how's your 1st day coldhead?
[16:44:15] <coldhead> indeed do many things come to pass
[16:44:23] <coldhead> GRINDING, BinaryKitten
[16:44:30] <coldhead> but i think i'm gonna make it through the night
[16:44:32] <coldhead> to day 2
[16:44:35] <coldhead> one of these days
[16:44:38] <BinaryKitten> don't worry coldhead day 2 is awesome
[16:44:44] <BinaryKitten> and full of magical unicorns
[16:44:51] <coldhead> oh awesome, thanks for the encouragement
[16:44:55] <BinaryKitten> ajpiano told me so
[16:45:09] <coldhead> dude is some kind of unicorn expert
[16:45:17] <BinaryKitten> so I hear
[16:45:31] <BinaryKitten> that and Taylor Swift
[16:45:44] <juho3> gonna ask once more; How do I trigger an event after draggable's stop has finished, and not at the same time with it
[16:45:57] <juho3> if i bind an event to dragstop, it runs it at the same time with draggable stop
[16:45:59] <juho3> not after it
[16:46:34] <juho3> did anyone understand my question? :)
[16:47:08] <BinaryKitten> night all and good luck coldhead... you can do it!
[16:52:38] <crazyzurfer> anyone here knows PHP?
[16:56:15] <coldhead> yes crazyzurfer but we'd discuss such things in ##php
[17:06:14] <crazyzurfer_> but
[17:06:21] <crazyzurfer_> when i try to join #php
[17:06:27] <crazyzurfer_> it says that i need invitation
[17:07:02] <coldhead> you probably just need to register with freenode, crazyzurfer_
[17:07:08] <coldhead>  /msg chanserv help
[17:07:20] <coldhead> or is it nickserv?
[17:07:31] <BinaryKitten> nickserv
[17:07:39] <coldhead> thanks bk
[17:07:53] <coldhead>  crazyzurfer_: try /msg nickserv help
[17:07:58] <coldhead> and look for the stuff about registering
[17:08:07] <coldhead> and do whatever it says, no matter how strange it seems
[17:08:29] <coldhead> then you can feast with the brave PHP warriors
[17:08:35] <coldhead> in valhalla
[17:11:56] <crazyzurfer_> how do i register my name?
[17:13:06] <fission6> how do i copy a link element modify its href and append it to another portion of the dom

[18:05:04] <caoyujiao> hello
[18:05:12] <caoyujiao> anyone here?
[18:09:41] <Interface> hey, does anyone here have any experience with Raphael.js?

[18:12:44] <ndss56> tw2113: website count?
[18:13:11] <tw2113> raphael.js' website
[18:14:29] <ndss56> tw2113: what you mean by "website count"?
[18:14:47] <tw2113> "hey, does anyone here have any experience with Raphael.js?"
[18:15:03] <tw2113> asking if experience in finding the website count as experience with it
[18:15:50] <tw2113> :D
[18:16:19] <ndss56> tw2113: i just wasted some life.
[18:16:29] <tw2113> i do that regularly
[18:16:52] <ndss56> tw2113: back to work :P
[18:18:16] <tw2113> debating making today a day off
[18:36:32] <raj> can I hide/show a <form>?
[18:36:52] <coldhead> ?tias @ raj
[18:36:53] <bot-t> raj, Try It And See
[18:36:55] <raj> via it's class
[18:36:57] <coldhead> seriously, bro
[18:37:01] <raj> well, i'm trying it and it's not working
[18:37:06] <raj> that's why i'm asking
[18:37:16] <coldhead> show us your codes?
[18:38:50] <smcguinness> I'm looking for a plugin that would work in a shopping cart that would allow me to show a "quick view" but doesn't open a modal in the center of the screen
[18:38:56] <coldhead> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/PmMJK/
[18:38:58] <smcguinness> rather it opens around the image
[18:39:00] <coldhead> defo works
[18:39:05] <coldhead> check yourself
[18:39:06] <smcguinness> with additional information
[18:42:12] <raj> coldhead, problem is it's hiding the form, but not the <li>'s of <inputs> i have within
[18:42:23] <raj> do I need fieldset for that?
[18:42:30] <raj> or I guess I can just use the ul
[18:42:50] <coldhead> you must have weird html raj
[18:43:07] <coldhead> if you hide a parent you shouldn't see its children
[18:43:14] <coldhead> under any circumstances i can think of
[18:44:31] <ndss56> raj: your html is probably not valid. don't forget the </form>
[18:44:34] <raj> yeah, something screwy is goig on, cuz this works http://jsfiddle.net/KqTjv/6/
[18:44:44] <raj> ndss56, yeah, i looked over the html like 10 times
[18:45:07] <raj> oh wait, that's on the div
[18:48:22] <raj> what's wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/KqTjv/9/
[18:51:00] <raj> ridiculous, i have so many stupid errors
[18:59:11] <alphamensch1> so many people in here O_O
[18:59:26] <coldhead> but you are the most important, alphamensch1
[18:59:50] <alphamensch1> why thank you
[18:59:57] <alphamensch1> i feel honoured
[19:00:33] <coldhead> raj: why don't you use </li> and not use </input>
[19:00:49] <coldhead> i don't think you're ready for those forms yet
[19:01:05] <coldhead> bot-t: tell alphamensch1 I will never forget you
[19:01:06] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[19:06:34] <joebobjoe> Under the source for $.each() why does jQuery call my callback w/ "callback.call( object[ i ], i, object[ i++ ]"? Shouldn't it be "callback.call( object[ i ], i, object[ i]"?
[19:06:58] <joebobjoe> Forget ending parens, sorry.
[19:21:45] * muzone is now playing: Muzone - Polyrhythm Thingie v0.1 (http://home.no/reddvinylene/polyrhythm_thingie_v0.1.mp3)
[19:22:27] <wycks> are there any issues with .resizable not working on cloned elements
[19:37:50] <coldhead> DOWN WITH STONKY
[19:42:56] <raj> how do I select everything EXCEPT a particular element (and its children)? So if any part of the document is clicked, except the <form> element? $(document).not('.myform').on('click', function(e) { ... })
[19:43:02] <raj> that doesn't work
[19:45:07] <coldhead> $('*').not(...)
[19:45:13] <raj> oh
[19:45:16] <raj> what's up with that coldhead?
[19:45:23] <coldhead> document is a single element
[19:45:27] <coldhead> the document
[19:45:39] <coldhead> you want E'RYTING
[19:46:50] <raj> oh, hmm
[19:47:52] <raj> coldhead, it needs to be in the callback of not?
[19:48:41] <Eviltwin> raj: You want this: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[19:48:48] <coldhead> your question makes me wonder if i have failed to understand you
[19:49:32] <raj> Eviltwin, yes, that is exactly what I was trying to do
[19:49:43] <raj> this is builtin?
[19:50:12] <Eviltwin> No but it's 0.9kb of code to add
[19:50:14] <Eviltwin> https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-outside-events/v1.1/jquery.ba-outside-events.min.js
[19:51:08] <Eviltwin> You can implement it in native jQuery but it'd be basically rewriting this plugin
[19:51:38] <raj> gotcha
[19:52:16] <raj> thank you
[20:01:48] <alystair> .removeClass() description says it can remove all classes
[20:01:58] <alystair> yet if you just leave it empty, it doesn't actually remove all classes?
[20:02:58] <alystair> oh wait
[20:03:08] <alystair> pebkac :/
[20:33:17] <spikku> So, I'm thinking about storing options in an element for use with the script. Example, something like "{  'next': 'img_c.png', 'prev': 'img_a.png' }" in an <a> tag for custom dialog options. Is there a standard attribute to put that in? Am I doing it wrong?
[21:11:11] <Interface> is it possible to add different amounts to width-right and width-left for example?
[21:13:02] <amirite> whats an easy and lightweight dimension plugin or extension that just works
[21:17:44] <coldhead> the one that was rolled into jquery core back in the 90s?
[21:19:53] <Whirl3d> good evening all. I was just reading the position api and it's a lot more robust than I thought.
[21:20:08] <Crimlo> ok
[21:20:14] <Crimlo> and
[21:20:51] <coldhead> how did your project for eviltwin turn out, Whirl3d ?
[21:21:56] <Whirl3d> coldhead, thanks for asking. Never heard back from him (though I don't blame him, really)
[21:22:30] <coldhead> you think he took his own life?
[21:22:39] <coldhead> anyway the point is how did YOU go with it
[21:23:42] <Whirl3d> Like I always do. I got it to a point that it was just about to work when I realized that if I refactored this and that, I could make it a little more polymorphic and solve another problem. Next thing you know, it's a complete wreck and I give up.
[21:24:41] <Eviltwin> Usually people realize they could make things more abstract, not more polymorphic
[21:24:57] <Whirl3d> hmmm
[21:26:45] <b0x> can someone help with my selector?? trying to select the currently selected option in a select box.. with.. $('#edit-date-value-day select option:selected')
[21:27:06] <b0x> basically so i can move it to the NEXT option with:  $('#edit-date-value-day select option:selected').removeAttr('selected').next('option').attr('selected', 'selected');
[21:27:12] <b0x> however my select is failing :(
[21:27:29] <b0x> console.log('CURVAL: ' + $('#edit-date-value-day select option:selected').val()); returns UNDEFINED
[21:27:52] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ b0x
[21:27:53] <bot-t> b0x, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:28:07] <b0x> live site: http://poc.purplec.com.au/dispatch-log ?
[21:28:23] <b0x> is linked to 'next day' button
[21:28:28] <ngharo> b0x, you dont need option:selected part
[21:28:38] <b0x> http://poc.purplec.com.au/sites/all/modules/poc_mod/poc_mod_script.js is file
[21:30:06] <b0x> hm
[21:30:19] <b0x> how would it know to goto the next option then
[21:31:38] <ngharo> you can call grab the index via .selectedIndex
[21:31:42] <ngharo> on the dom element
[21:31:59] <Whirl3d> my biggest problem (from my perspective) is that I don't have any solid experience that says, "it is best to approach this in this manner" So I head down one path, get almost to the end and then realize that had I just been a little less specific or a little more specific back there, I'd be a lot better off now.
[21:32:17] <Whirl3d> Needless to say it doesn't take long to get absolutely nowhere.
[21:32:35] <coldhead>  such is the getting of wisdom, Whirl3d
[21:33:24] <T_Zano> #Question : Is there recommended library/Framework to use Tablet and gesture support for the visualization using JQuery ?
[21:34:04] <Whirl3d> That's why I am here 23 hours a day---trying to see how you all approach things and then trying to implement it in my projects.
[21:34:07] <b0x> hm
[21:34:19] <b0x> ngharo: can u expand on how id do this?
[21:34:21] <dytrivedi> T_Zano: #Answer: Visualization? Graphs?
[21:34:43] <T_Zano> dytrivedi : Any one
[21:34:49] <dytrivedi> well
[21:35:02] <T_Zano> 'cause I am visualizing BIG Data
[21:35:11] <dytrivedi> well
[21:35:30] <dytrivedi> I'd recommend d3
[21:35:53] <dytrivedi> http://mbostock.github.com/d3/
[21:36:40] <dytrivedi> beware - it is my first day using jQuery
[21:37:26] <b0x> ok
[21:37:37] <T_Zano> dytrivedi : d3 doesn't support touched-events
[21:37:41] <b0x> so the issue was i didn't need 'select' as the ID i was using was the select box
[21:37:44] <b0x> works fine without it
[21:37:57] <ngharo> b0x: http://jsfiddle.net/88j84/1/
[21:38:08] <b0x> ie: $('#edit-date-value-day option:selected').removeAttr('selected').next('option').attr('selected', 'selected');
[21:38:18] <b0x> \o/
[21:38:39] <dytrivedi> T_Zano: Then FusionCharts, HighCharts, etc.
[21:40:44] <Whirl3d> when using an .on handler, is it a problem to assign several "click" handlers with different selectors rather than trying to decipher event.target in a single click handler?
[21:41:43] <Whirl3d> $(holder).on("click",".control", handleControls).on("click","img",handleImage)....etc.
[21:43:01] <Whirl3d> or $(holder).on("click", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target); if (targ.is(".control")) handleControls(e); if (targ.is("img")) handleImage(e);....
[21:43:38] <T_Zano> dytrivedi : Ok I'm checking out .
[21:43:53] <dytrivedi> cool
[21:48:00] <abjorn> :o
[21:48:01] <bot-t> (69 hours 40 mins ago) <coldhead> tell abjorn i got legitimate questions, stand by to answer me
[21:48:10] <abjorn> coldhead: hmmmm?
[21:48:21] <coldhead> oh right
[21:48:23] <coldhead> sup abjsy
[21:48:27] <abjorn> lol
[21:48:33] <coldhead> so let's just say you were a punk kid
[21:48:35] <coldhead> in highschool
[21:48:40] <abjorn> oh?
[21:48:41] <coldhead> with firewalls and shit
[21:48:57] <coldhead> what would you do for a proxy kinda dealio?
[21:49:10] <coldhead> in your extensive VPS/server experience
[21:49:19] <coldhead> what does a clever and mildly evil teen want
[21:49:33] <coldhead> to raise hell on the far side of a firewall
[21:49:36] <coldhead> if ya feel me
[21:49:55] <abjorn> most schools block proxy sites
[21:49:58] <abjorn> mine always did
[21:50:00] <abjorn> but uh
[21:50:03] <abjorn> there's bunches out there?
[21:50:18] <coldhead> so but that's what i was thinking
[21:50:22] <coldhead> this enterprising kid
[21:50:28] <coldhead> gets himself some kind of server
[21:50:30] <abjorn> pagewash.com is what I'd always use
[21:50:33] <coldhead> and installs some kind of something
[21:50:39] <coldhead> and has his own proxy
[21:50:40] <abjorn> I never did anything special with proxies
[21:50:43] <coldhead> for all services
[21:50:46] <coldhead> not just web
[21:50:54] <abjorn> oh
[21:50:57] <abjorn> I never did any shit like that
[21:50:58] <ruby_on_tails> someone call the police
[21:51:02] <coldhead> and since no one else uses it, it doesn't get black listed
[21:51:06] <coldhead> lol rubsy
[21:51:12] <coldhead> no i never did either, abjorn
[21:51:15] <coldhead> but i got this kid brother
[21:51:26] <coldhead> and i'd like to have him level up
[21:51:36] <coldhead> the old carrot and stick approach
[21:51:53] <abjorn> I only ever used proxy sites like pagewash.com for checking questionable websites or seeing if a site's DNS is propagating or some shit
[21:52:10] <coldhead> like if he had a VPS account with your illustrious company, would he be able to proxy through that and would mgmt ever know/care?
[21:52:24] <abjorn> it's against TOS
[21:52:29] <abjorn> and they would know
[21:52:32] <abjorn> and he wouldn't be able to
[21:52:36] <coldhead> RIGHT
[21:52:42] <coldhead> this is the expertise i was after
[21:52:47] <coldhead> AND
[21:52:55] <coldhead> i guess it's against TOS everywhere
[21:52:56] <coldhead> right?
[21:53:01] <abjorn> not everywhere
[21:53:05] <abjorn> but most major companies
[21:53:17] <coldhead> so if i buy my own hardware...
[21:53:20] <coldhead> and write my own TOS
[21:53:23] <coldhead> muahahaha?
[21:53:36] <coldhead> littlebastardsvpsco.com
[21:53:48] <abjorn> any company that's offering you anything other than a dedicated server would likely have to open inbound ports for you to be able to do that anyways
[21:54:06] <coldhead> right right right!
[21:54:16] <coldhead> you can tell i don't know shit about this stuff
[21:54:27] <coldhead> looks like own hardware is the way
[21:54:27] <pen> how do I get DOMstring from a jquery object?
[21:54:30] <abjorn> on our dedi's you wouldn't need to, you would just need to open it in iptables, but it's still against the TOS
[21:54:43] <coldhead> yeah cool
[21:54:52] <abjorn> well, you can get the DOM object with jQueryObject.context, pen
[21:55:12] <coldhead> i;ll try my own box unless you know of any ghetto places we could get away with
[21:55:14] <coldhead> thanks abjorn
[21:55:21] <pen> abjorn: cool
[21:55:24] <pen> abjorn: let me try
[21:55:51] <abjorn> keep in mind, that DOM object might be a nodelist :3
[21:58:11] <abjorn> >mfw i have to school my coworkers on how to javascripts like erryday
[21:58:44] <abjorn> I'm like
[21:58:50] <pen> abjorn: weird, seems like context cannot be stored in dataTransfer
[21:58:55] <abjorn> "Y U NO USE ===?"
[21:59:16] <abjorn> pen: put up an example of what you're trying to do on jsfiddle or similar
[22:00:01] <pen> abjorn: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/     basically this but in jquery version. So I want to store the whole jquery node in the dataTransfer instead of vanilla javascript DOM object
[22:00:30] <pen> abjorn: was following his guide and used your context but it is empty when I try to retrieve from it
[22:03:43] <pen> abjorn: so in dragstart I store the data and then immediately console.log the getData
[22:03:50] <pen> nothing came back
[22:03:55] <TylerW> ok... thats enough of the css channel for me :-P
[22:04:38] <abjorn> So the DOM node is empty, then? Well try to see what the length is of the jQuery object
[22:04:47] <abjorn> you might have an empty jquery object :3
[22:05:16] <pen> abjorn: ahh, I think I know why, it takes a string, but context is still an object. I guess
[22:05:30] <abjorn> that would probably do it
[22:05:42] <pen> abjorn: I print $(this).context and there are stuff. but how do I convert that into string?
[22:06:31] <abjorn> You don't? Not really, anyways
[22:06:35] <abjorn> You shouldn't need to
[22:07:08] <pen> abjorn: but setData is not storing it
[22:07:20] <pen> I guess it is because it is not taking javascript DOM object?
[22:07:45] <coldhead> ?mdc tostring
[22:07:50] <bot-t> coldhead, toString - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a string representing the object. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString
[22:07:51] <abjorn> in the example it shows he's passing innerHTML to setData
[22:08:11] <abjorn> coldhead: It's a DOM node, so serializing it isn't going to work the way he wants
[22:08:54] <b0x> is there a .previous() function, like a reverse of .next() ?
[22:09:01] <abjorn> ?previous
[22:09:02] <bot-t> abjorn, .prev() - Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[22:09:05] <abjorn> SURE IS
[22:09:08] <b0x> sweeet
[22:09:32] <abjorn> pen: e.dataTransfer.setData("text/html", jQueryObject.html());
[22:09:51] <pen> abjorn: I want everything including the tag attr of the node, html only returns the content
[22:10:36] <abjorn> Then wrap the element you want to drag and drop in a wrapper element
[22:11:37] <pen> abjorn: is there no easy way to get the node itself?
[22:11:52] <pen> abjorn: and I want the attrs too, classes, etc
[22:12:09] <abjorn> I mean, you can get all the attributes of the element with jquery
[22:12:41] <abjorn> but you'll have to find a way to serialize all that and pass it along, which is far more work than it's worth, and rather inefficient. It's smarter to just wrap it in a div
[22:13:44] <raj> any usual way that when an item is cloned, to give it a new id with some incrementing number?
[22:13:59] <raj> myelem_1, myelem_2, etc
[22:14:08] <abjorn> track the last id you used in a variable somewhere
[22:14:11] <pen> abjorn: oh, you mean wrap it with div and then do html?
[22:14:26] <coldhead> raj: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5612582/using-jquery-guid
[22:15:42] <abjorn> raj: https://gist.github.com/2156276
[22:16:04] <abjorn> meh
[22:16:07] <abjorn> i guess you could do that, coldhead
[22:16:10] <abjorn> I LIKE MINE BETTER
[22:17:32] <asdf700> Hi Everyoneâ€¦ using multiple jquery libraries on the same pageâ€¦ no conflict code isn't helping any suggestions on how to get them to both work?
[22:17:51] <abjorn> coldhead: my preincrement makes crockford cry
[22:18:30] <abjorn> asdf700: They're both going to be using window.jQuery whether you use noConflict or not
[22:18:37] <coldhead> oh absolutely, do whatever abjorn says
[22:18:45] <coldhead> it's my first day using jQuery
[22:18:46] <Cork> asdf700: store the return value from noConflict
[22:18:49] <coldhead> pay me no mind
[22:18:57] <Cork> asdf700: then use that variable
[22:19:06] <coldhead> can i interest any of you gentlement in please kill me?
[22:19:45] <abjorn> oh right, noconflict returns jquery
[22:19:45] <donCams> coldhead: i've always wanted to try to kill a man
[22:19:47] <abjorn> i always forget that
[22:19:51] <asdf700> cold.. would you mind taking a look at my code and let me know what you think?
[22:19:57] <donCams> coz i'm still meaning to kill a certain b*tch
[22:19:58] <abjorn> you're gonna want to use noConflict(true) though
[22:20:21] <donCams> coldhead: if I (function($){})(jQuery); should i still call noConflict?
[22:20:31] <abjorn> coldhead: No, it's too fun saying coldhod
[22:22:15] <Cork> donCams: depends
[22:22:36] <Cork> donCams: jQuery will always be the last jquery version you loaded
[22:22:45] <donCams> ah
[22:22:47] <Cork> donCams: as the varaible is overwritten
[22:22:58] <donCams> so that would depend if you have multiple jQuery versions loaded?
[22:23:07] <donCams> cool
[22:23:54] <Cork> donCams: well you would actually have to hack the plugin if you want a specific version of jQuery
[22:24:17] <donCams> i'm confused. i'll sleep again. :))
[22:24:24] <Cork> donCams: but noConflict is mainly used to give back the control of $ to its original owner (for example prototype or similar)
[22:24:36] <donCams> ok
[22:26:23] <abjorn> anyways, im tired, so fuck ya'll im goin to bed
[22:26:26] <abjorn> night coldhead
[22:26:27] <abjorn> coldhod
[22:26:29] <abjorn> caldhad
[22:26:31] <abjorn> cldhod

[22:28:40] <coldhead> ?eval continue;
[22:28:41] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: continue must be inside loop
[22:28:43] <asdf700> Could someone please look at my code I need help with conflicting jquery libraries.. emergency help!
[22:28:50] <coldhead> goddamn bot-t you sound just like my browser
[22:29:15] <coldhead> asdf700: we'll get abjorn to help when he returns
[22:29:19] <coldhead> he's a sharp dude
[22:29:33] <asdf700> sweet.. becauce im not
[22:29:40] <asdf700> im too deep into the matrix right now.. my brain my explode
[22:32:33] <Cork> asdf700: if you want ppl to look at your code you should link to it :)
[22:34:06] <asdf700> Cork thanks.. ill do that
[22:35:15] <KnowWhat> Hi there
[22:35:27] <coldhead> ?eval Infinity = 0; 1 > Infinity;
[22:35:28] <bot-t> coldhead: true
[22:35:28] <KnowWhat> how can i find a certain class in a certain element?
[22:35:42] <coldhead> ?find @ KnowWhat
[22:35:43] <bot-t> KnowWhat, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[22:38:03] <KnowWhat> i have 4 clases set to an element
[22:38:31] <coldhead> cool
[22:38:37] <coldhead> i usually only have 3
[22:38:40] <KnowWhat> e.g. <a href='' class='one two three four' >  i want to replace class two with five
[22:38:58] <coldhead> $('.two').toggleClass('two five');
[22:39:01] <coldhead> ?toggleClass
[22:39:02] <bot-t> .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[22:40:22] <KnowWhat> thanks that worked
[22:40:57] <KnowWhat> but when i place this in my success function within the .ajax function it does not work, though alert() works in there which means it does succeed
[22:41:30] <Cork> KnowWhat: define "doens't work"
[22:41:36] <Cork> *doesn't
[22:42:14] <KnowWhat> oh i got it working
[22:42:33] <KnowWhat> i was using this and in success function reference to this gets changed
[22:42:37] <KnowWhat> pardon me for this
[22:42:48] <Cork> heh
[22:43:54] <coldhead> GREAT JOB EVERYONE
[22:44:01] <coldhead> asdf700: you got a link forthcoming?
[22:53:03] <Whirl3d> can you bind the load event using "bind" and if so, can you namespace it to unbind easily like; $(img).bind({load.init:doLoadSuccess, error.init:doLoadError});
[22:56:04] <smplstk> woops
[22:56:08] <bananas> hi! i am fetching some div's via .load() but the new div's do not have other functionality. how do you get around this?
[22:56:25] <joebobjoe> I think jQuery's data() method is behaving stupidly.
[22:57:11] <smplstk> ?:has
[22:58:07] <joebobjoe> Why is it that data() accesses both hidden DOM data and attributes...??? And it parses them differently, too.
[22:58:09] <coldhead> ?on @ bananas

[23:02:53] <Whirl3d> the load event isn't propogated is it? can I use .on to listen for a load event on a child element?
[23:02:57] <deanclkclk_> hey folks
[23:03:11] <deanclkclk_> if I have an accordion..how can I trigger a click so that panel expands?
[23:03:15] <deanclkclk_> click with jquery
[23:04:20] <smplstk> COME BACK BOT-T
[23:04:31] <raj> abjorn, where did `node` come from in that code?
[23:04:40] <raj> the argument
[23:04:58] <raj> oh, nm
[23:05:07] <raj> maybe if someone else knows?
[23:05:12] <raj> https://gist.github.com/2156276
[23:06:04] <smplstk> coldhead: fair enough
[23:06:05] <coldhead> sup smplstk
[23:06:12] <smplstk> ?on @coldhead
[23:06:12] <bot-t> coldhead, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:06:14] <coldhead> least SOMEONE knows how to rejoin
[23:06:19] <JonathanNeal> david_mark
[23:06:21] <ioscale1> raj node is what is handed to the function that is getting returnedâ€¦ it's just a var.
[23:06:31] <JonathanNeal> bot-t: where is david_mark?
[23:06:32] <bot-t> JonathanNeal, As I see it, yes.
[23:06:36] <smplstk> coldhead: how'd you get bot-t to come back?
[23:06:48] <JonathanNeal> caniuse canvas
[23:06:49] <caniuse> JonathanNeal: You can use Canvas (basic support) with Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 2, Chrome 4, Safari 3.1, Opera 9, iOS Safari 3.2, and Opera Mobile 10. http://caniuse.com/#search=canvas

[23:07:10] <raj> ioscale1, but when it's called, it's called without any arguments
[23:07:22] <smplstk> trolololol
[23:07:24] <raj> actually, it's not called at all
[23:07:28] <raj> it's returned
[23:07:33] <raj> so where is node coming from?
[23:07:43] <smplstk> caniuse canvas websockets @ JonathanNeal

[23:07:47] <raj> what's providing the first argument to that function?
[23:07:51] <smplstk> WHAT NO @ ?
[23:08:00] <JonathanNeal> no @ man
[23:09:22] <ioscale1> after u execute you can do clone_node(SOME_NODE)
[23:11:03] <tilda[A]> perhaps someone can help me to debug :   http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/ (looks like ajax cannot handle var larger than 255 chars)
[23:11:13] * tilda is no longer away : Gone for 15 hours 35 minutes 15 seconds
[23:11:35] <smplstk> ?:has @ smplstk

[23:15:01] <bananas> caniuse: cheers, mate!
[23:15:29] <tilda> is there a limit of size of a post variable in $.ajax ?
[23:16:00] <raj> depends on your server i think
[23:16:28] <tilda> clientside limit
[23:16:54] <raj> dunno
[23:17:32] <raj> tilda, doesn't it just stream otherwise?
[23:17:34] <tilda> raj:   http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/ - does this work for you ?
[23:17:54] <tilda> or do you get an error ?
[23:18:19] <raj> works
[23:18:36] <raj> but i'm very trusting
[23:18:50] <tilda> you dont get an error alert ?
[23:19:03] <raj> no, it's a 'works' alert
[23:19:24] <tilda> perhaps its firebug that does it. I'll try to disable mine
[23:23:15] <tilda> raj : what browser are you using ?
[23:23:29] <raj> chrome
[23:24:11] <tilda> so weird , I get the error alert
[23:24:18] <tilda> raj: win7 ?
[23:31:22] <rpk> If I'm selecting $("#id") does var idPane = $(#id-pane);  $("#id", idPane) help any for multiple selections?
[23:32:39] <rpk> (does it restrict the scope of #id / help with perf at all?, or is it not used because an #id should only be once per page and most browsers have a native method?)
[23:34:49] <ExpFist> Question: When doing a $.post with "json" specified, how do you determine if a non-JSON response is provided?
[23:35:29] <ExpFist> my 'success' routine doesn't seem to fire
[23:35:43] <JoeyCadle> When binding a 'change' event to a select, how do I text the text inside of the <option></option> chosen? I'm binding as $('select').live('change', function() { }); -- using .live cuz it's ajax loaded.
[23:36:44] <Cork> $(this).find('option[value="' + $(this).val() + '"]').text()
[23:36:44] <rpk> ExpFist: bind to error (jqXHR, status, error)?
[23:37:52] <rpk> Also, jquery ui wise, does anyone know the recommended place to put your html thats going into a modal window?  (concerned about putting it into a hidden div and then running $("#id")s against that div and the modal one...
[23:38:30] <anli_> How do I add a mouse over style on a component that I have created with code?
[23:38:38] <anli_> Do I have to use a mouseover hander?
[23:39:09] <smplstk> anli_: you should just be able to use :hover css rules
[23:39:23] <smplstk> even if it's something that was added after the page load
[23:39:33] <anli_> smplstk: Yes, but do I have to use them?
[23:39:57] <ExpFist> rpk: Hidden divs work perfectly for that
[23:40:00] <Cork> anli_: either you need to use css :hover or do it through js
[23:40:28] <rpk> ExpFist: what happens to the original content when the dialog is called on it, removed from the dom?
[23:40:47] <Cork> anli_: and :hover only works in rules so it can't be inline
[23:42:27] <smplstk> anli_: http://jsfiddle.net/eYgxr/
[23:42:47] <ExpFist> Actually I'm wrong, I don't hide it
[23:42:48] <smplstk> anli_: no hover event in JS land
[23:42:58] <coldhead> e
[23:43:22] <ExpFist> When you do a $({#div-model}).dialog
[23:43:25] <ExpFist> It'll hide it for you
[23:43:55] <ExpFist> assuming autoOpen is set to false
[23:44:20] <rpk> oh ok, cool
[23:46:47] <djeeza> is there any reason not to use the widget factory to write a plugin?

[23:56:23] <coldhead> well that was shortlived
[23:56:25] <tilda[A]> yes.. with this so weird post bug.
[23:56:51] * tilda is no longer away : Gone for 32 minutes 33 seconds
[23:57:08] <coldhead> says here you're back now, tilda
[23:57:22] <tilda> http://jsfiddle.net/TFhxq/4/  - I keep getting error on this.
[23:58:18] <coldhead> it says it works for me
[23:59:03] <tilda> yes, thats the weird part. some get it to work. some don't.
[23:59:25] <tilda> I tried restart FF in safe mode.. no add-ons..  chrome, IE .. all give me error
[23:59:46] <tilda> even tried on a new installed VM ubuntu 11, FF, chrom.. get error
[23:59:55] <coldhead> i'm happy on ubuntu chrome
