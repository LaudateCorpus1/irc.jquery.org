[00:01:28] <ch3mical> LOL OMFG
[00:01:31] <ch3mical> I just figured it out
[00:01:48] <ch3mical> You're all going to facepalm
[00:01:56] <Tallisman> hmm, lets see..
[00:02:17] <ch3mical> kwaa: the one that doesn't show is width:1px;height:1px;
[00:02:31] <ch3mical> I changed it on the console to 940 by 350 and it appeared
[00:02:36] <ch3mical> Like magic
[00:03:06] <Tallisman> http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091108091508/residentevil/images/5/5b/Facepalm-combo.jpg
[00:03:15] <ch3mical> ROFL
[00:03:21] <kwaa> But I never change that? So I just set my css for the div to 940 by 350?
[00:03:27] <ch3mical> That image is epic
[00:03:36] <Tallisman> =]
[00:03:57] <ch3mical> kwaa: I don't know how/why it's being set to 1px, you should find out why and fix that rather than bandaid fix it
[00:04:06] <Tallisman> you know what the sad part is? I recognise nearly all of those characters.
[00:04:26] <ch3mical> (as in don't just reset it to the right size, find out what changed its size and make it stop doing it)
[00:04:40] <ch3mical> Tallisman: same
[00:04:41] <abstrusenick> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6180454/how-do-i-append-data-to-a-jquery-ujs-post-request-in-rails
[00:04:45] <abstrusenick> anybody can help?
[00:05:42] <ch3mical> kwaa: problem solved?
[00:06:17] <kwaa> ch3mical: It probably is, but I'm not sure how to achive it.
[00:06:24] <Tallisman> Sorry abstrucenick.. never used rails :P
[00:06:38] <kwaa> Okej..
[00:06:40] <kwaa> I think I got it
[00:07:06] <ch3mical> Cool
[00:07:18] <ch3mical> Don't forget to display:none the #graphical-slider
[00:07:24] <abstrusenick> Tallisman: do you know how to append data parameters in ajax beforeSend callback?
[00:07:47] <ch3mical> abstrusenick: define "data parameters"?
[00:07:58] <Tallisman> define beforeSend callback..
[00:07:59] <kwaa> ch3mical: If I do, it wont work... But as it is right now. It will load with 2 sliders, then press one of them, and it will turn into one working...
[00:08:02] <kwaa> (with both)
[00:08:15] <abstrusenick> oh cmon
[00:08:20] <Tallisman> $.post?
[00:08:35] <ch3mical> see ?beforeSend
[00:08:36] <bot-t> ch3mical, jQuery.ajax() - Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[00:08:43] <ch3mical> LIES!!!
[00:08:57] <abstrusenick> no
[00:09:15] <abstrusenick> $.ajax has data argument right
[00:09:24] <abstrusenick> Data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string, if not already a string. It's appended to the url for GET-requests. See processData option to prevent this automatic processing. Object must be Key/Value pairs. If value is an Array, jQuery serializes multiple values with same key based on the value of the traditional setting (described below).
[00:09:59] <abstrusenick> i would like to append this data from ajax beforeSend callback
[00:11:07] <ch3mical> kwaa: looks like it's working now
[00:11:19] <ch3mical> Oh wait, I hadn't refreshed
[00:11:46] <kwaa> ch3mical: Nah... Im lost.
[00:12:21] <ch3mical> kwaa: try to add $('#graphical-slider').toggle(); in your script
[00:12:24] <kwaa> ch3mical: The closest I can get is to have two sliders, click one of the links, and then start working.
[00:12:28] <kwaa> Ok
[00:12:58] <kwaa> Nah
[00:12:59] <ch3mical> WTF
[00:13:16] <ch3mical> ok ok fine, bandaid-fix it is
[00:13:50] <ch3mical> Just do      $( $(this).data('div_id')).show().width(940).height(350).siblings(".slider").hide();
[00:14:22] <ch3mical> Or put the show after height, just to make sure we don't see it resize
[00:14:40] <ch3mical>      $( $(this).data('div_id')).width(940).height(350).show().siblings(".slider").hide();
[00:14:51] <ch3mical> Try both
[00:16:49] <kwaa> Like I have now? cause it dosnt work for me
[00:17:17] <kwaa> 		   $(".chose a").click(function(e)
[00:17:17] <kwaa> 		   {
[00:17:17] <kwaa> 		       e.preventDefault();
[00:17:17] <kwaa> 		       $( $(this).attr("href") ).show().siblings(".slider").hide();
[00:17:17] <kwaa> 		   });
[00:17:19] <kwaa> 		});
[00:17:22] <kwaa> 	</script>
[00:17:36] <kwaa> That part work, and yeah, I'm not allowed to post 6 lines at once.
[00:17:53] <ch3mical> Uhh
[00:17:53] <kwaa> But the part that is supposed to make it so that only one show once loaded dosnt work.
[00:18:17] <ch3mical> You replaced the wrong line
[00:18:23] <kwaa> Oh
[00:18:36] <coldhead> :D
[00:18:58] <kwaa> Tried that too
[00:19:02] <kwaa> If this is how you ment
[00:19:53] <ch3mical> Yeah but leave the $('#graphical-slider').toggle(); in
[00:23:08] <kwaa> Wow... I really can't make this work.
[00:23:14] <ch3mical> Well that's just strange
[00:23:59] <ch3mical> This should not be so hard
[00:24:21] <kwaa> Indeed
[00:24:30] <GoSox> thats what she said
[00:24:40] <ch3mical> That's definitely NOT what she said.
[00:24:48] <GoSox> maybe not to you
[00:24:54] <GoSox> an average man
[00:25:26] <ch3mical> kwaa: try .hide() instead of .toggle there?
[00:25:59] <ch3mical> Shouldn't matter, but then again...
[00:26:00] <kwaa> I still get two sliders at pageload
[00:27:18] <ch3mical> T_T
[00:43:59] <kwaa> Freenode is being slow?
[00:44:33] <thomedy> alright i think all is well again
[00:45:09] <kwaa> Tallisman: Is there any way so do something like "if (current_slider == "web") print sometext"?
[00:50:49] <thomedy> is everything okay jquery
[00:50:54] <thomedy> are you feeling well.
[00:51:05] <GoSox> someone broke irc
[00:51:12] <thomedy> well its better again
[00:51:17] <GoSox> sadly, it fixed itself
[00:51:19] <thomedy> do you do ajax with jquery
[00:51:26] <thomedy> im trying to figure out how
[00:51:31] <thomedy> i was doing some reading
[00:51:38] <thomedy> and found the $.get()
[00:51:48] <GoSox> i went through a huge period of productivity starting right around the time I stopped 'casually' hanging out on irc
[00:52:01] <thomedy> but im unfamiliar with ajax
[00:52:24] <thomedy> i need irc
[00:52:48] <thomedy> when i get stumped irc is my safety net
[00:52:59] <Qbix1> hi
[00:53:31] <GoSox> irc is like crack
[00:53:34] <GoSox> it feels good at first
[00:53:37] <GoSox> then it eats your soul
[00:54:04] <thomedy> i have never used crack but it seems like they should put tat in the ads
[00:54:04] <macheleon> that it does
[00:54:09] <thomedy> it will eat your soul
[00:54:29] <GoSox> i've also never done crack, but i thought it was pretty well understood that it eats your soul
[00:54:53] <lxsameer> how can i append an html code to a tag html ?
[00:54:55] <thomedy> so they do advertise it
[00:55:10] <thomedy> isn't athat $.html()
[00:55:26] <thomedy> im not sure lxsameer im still learning but i think its somewhere in there
[00:55:55] <lxsameer> thomedy: i think $.html replace the current html not appending
[00:56:40] <thomedy> ohp i tried sorry
[00:56:55] <thomedy> i thought i might be helpfull but i think i have to be smart first
[00:57:17] <Tallisman> <div>bla</div> - $("div").html("<div id="bla"></div>");
[00:57:34] <Tallisman> <div><div id="bla"></div></div>
[00:57:58] <Tallisman> $("div").append("<div id="bla"></div>");
[00:58:18] <Tallisman> <div>bla<div id="bla"></div></div>
[00:58:41] <Phelms215> isnt it blah?
[00:58:53] <Tallisman> could be, but bla will do ^^
[00:58:58] <Phelms215> =p
[00:59:13] <thomedy> can someone direct me to a good jqery/ajax tutorial for the .get funccion

[01:14:10] <jeeten> fine
[01:14:16] <jeeten> than what abt u
[01:14:27] <systemfault> thomedy: They just want to get some shitty plugin they found working
[01:14:33] <jeeten> did u learn jquery very well
[01:14:35] <systemfault> Err
[01:14:35] <Phelms215> i am very confussed on where this conversation is going
[01:14:41] <systemfault> I mean Tallisman :/
[01:14:56] <Tallisman> Lol, some people do :p
[01:15:12] <systemfault> I like jQuery :P
[01:15:39] <coldhead> I LIKE TURTLES
[01:15:56] <Tallisman> who doesn't, it greatly simplifies javascript, speeding up development.. btw, systemfault, do you have some sort of portfolio?
[01:16:24] <Tallisman> oh, and coldhead->TURTLES!!!
[01:16:46] <systemfault> Tallisman: Working on it.. Already bought the domain name..:/
[01:16:53] <Tallisman> :)
[01:17:21] <systemfault> Tallisman: I haven't developped a lot "professionally" with jQuery yet
[01:17:28] <systemfault> We're using YUI3 at work.
[01:17:58] <Tallisman> I´ll need to fetch myself one to..
[01:18:01] <Tallisman> O.O
[01:18:12] <systemfault> But I started to include jQuery in our software stack :P
[01:18:20] <Tallisman> is that text cursive..±
[01:18:25] <systemfault> And now I use it for newer projects
[01:18:34] <systemfault> Cursive?
[01:18:58] <Tallisman> hmm, i need to fix my keyboard config again.. moment
[01:19:12] <Phelms215> so I have to ask who here is on reddit?
[01:19:22] <Tallisman> who isn´t=
[01:19:28] <systemfault> I'm a reddit lurker.
[01:19:35] <Phelms215> i figured you all were reddit nerds... fj is wayy better
[01:19:36] <systemfault> I don't even have an account..
[01:19:43] <systemfault> fj?
[01:19:48] <Phelms215> funnyjunk
[01:19:49] <Phelms215> duh ?
[01:19:49] <systemfault> The best is HN
[01:20:00] <Phelms215> (trolling btw)
[01:20:15] <gnarf> I IRC
[01:20:30] <systemfault> gnarf: Not reddit or HN for you? :/
[01:20:42] <systemfault> john resig likes reddit :P
[01:20:51] <gnarf> systemfault: nope
[01:21:24] <kwaa> hey again
[01:21:35] <systemfault> Not again?
[01:21:38] <systemfault> j/k :)
[01:21:40] <systemfault> Welcome
[01:21:45] <kwaa> Thank you
[01:22:08] <Tallisman> fuuuuuuuu; keyboard trolls meh
[01:22:15] <kwaa> ^^
[01:22:22] <kwaa> http://imkwaa.com/
[01:22:37] <kwaa> Managed to get a text depending on which slider your on
[01:23:00] <kwaa> But since the script thinks that <div> is an img, it jumps whenever the cycle is over.
[01:23:17] <kwaa> Any better solution, or any way to skip the skip? ^^
[01:23:43] <systemfault> You get a lot of 404s
[01:23:51] <gnarf> systemfault: you're brave
[01:23:51] <Tallisman> why doesn´t effin windows work.. lol
[01:24:03] <systemfault> gnarf: Why? :(
[01:24:04] <kwaa> systemfault: I do?
[01:24:06] <Tallisman> ±±
[01:24:42] <systemfault> kwaa: If you check in the console
[01:25:06] <systemfault> Your script is trying to get http://imkwaa.com/undefined
[01:26:18] <kwaa> Okey
[01:28:40] <innociv> How do I do something like.. object.setActive(); were setActive is some function i've made?  And object would be something like object = functionThatDoesSomethingThenReturnsAnObject();?
[01:29:20] <Tallisman> okey, can´t seem to be able to get it to work = is ´wherever the question mark is now´, ´is´ is °
[01:29:30] <Tallisman> does anyone know how to fix=
[01:29:44] <systemfault> innociv: var myObject = {}; myObject.setActive = function() { code here}; ?
[01:29:58] <systemfault> Tallisman: Do you have a code or something^
[01:29:59] <systemfault> ?
[01:30:25] <Tallisman> keycode= probably, but I do not know what to type..
[01:30:56] <Tallisman> my keyboard config is screwed because of a wrong hit i suppose.
[01:31:38] <innociv> So.. createObject = function(){ objects[id] = $(Blah blah); objects[id].setActive = function(){ //context function} } ?
[01:32:04] <gnarf> innociv: what is the object?
[01:32:09] <gnarf> innociv: is it jQuery?
[01:32:36] <innociv> I did want it to be one, yes.  I could do objects[id].el = $(foo); though instead.
[01:32:51] <gnarf> innociv: you can store functions with .data()
[01:32:56] <gnarf> then the actual element has it
[01:34:03] <innociv> But I want to call the function in a chain.  Like say I var object = getObjectById(id); I want to then object.setActive();
[01:34:05] <innociv> for cleanliness sake
[01:34:11] <Tallisman> gotcha
[01:34:18] <Tallisman> it was ctrl + shift
[01:35:31] <Tallisman> anyhow, what I was saying before this anoying incident. I need to fetch myself a portfolio to =(.
[01:36:06] <Tallisman> Otherwise I'll get behind on my classmates, they will get rich and I will be somewhere in afrika being a slave.
[01:36:28] <DannyZB> How do I revert the action of a jquery-BUTTON checkbox?
[01:36:44] <DannyZB> with a regular checkbox I just put "e.preventDefault" or "return false" on the click callback
[01:37:01] <DannyZB> on a jquery toggle-button it only disables it after the second click
[01:37:20] <DannyZB> I want the button to toggle itself only after a server approves the action
[01:37:43] <Tallisman> euhm, you want to make a checkbox unclickable?
[01:38:25] <gnarf> ?p @DannyZB
[01:38:26] <bot-t> DannyZB, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js or http://fixee.org/
[01:39:59] <ch3mical> Is there not a way to remove the "X" button on a jqUI dialog?
[01:40:26] <ch3mical> I think I'm going to have to hide or remove it manually
[01:40:30] <ch3mical> T_T
[01:40:52] <Tallisman> why remove it?
[01:41:23] <ch3mical> It's a login dialog, I don't want it closed until it gets a valid login
[01:42:36] <DannyZB> just check the class of the "x" button and do $(".class","#dialogid").hide();
[01:43:13] <Tallisman> aside from that, you only want to make login available for people with javascript on?
[01:43:24] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's what I'm saying it looks like I'll have to do, but it sucks that there isn't just an initialization option for it
[01:43:49] <ch3mical> Tallisman: if they have javascript off they can't use the page at all, lol
[01:44:09] <ch3mical> Login or no
[01:45:02] <Tallisman> hmm, I suppose anschronimious javascript is a hoax anyway :P
[01:45:19] <Tallisman> I don't even know how to write it xD
[01:45:22] <gnarf> Tallisman: ummm
[01:45:32] <gnarf> Tallisman: thats not a word
[01:45:32] <Tant102> I use it, so I doubt it's a hoax.
[01:45:46] <Tant102> I guess he mean asynchronous.
[01:45:52] <Tallisman> ye
[01:45:54] <DannyZB> what is the address of the google jquery ui?
[01:46:09] <gnarf> ?cdn
[01:46:10] <bot-t> gnarf, Downloading jQuery - The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document. If you've spotted some areas of code that could be improved, please feel free to discuss it on the Development mailing list... http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[01:47:58] <DannyZB> you wanted me to pass the code.. fiddle doesn't incluce jquery UI
[01:50:42] <gnarf> DannyZB: http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html#jqueryUI
[01:50:45] <Tallisman> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.13/i18n/jquery-ui-i18n.min.js
[01:50:58] <gnarf> DannyZB: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.13/jquery-ui.min.js
[01:51:09] <DannyZB> thx
[01:51:15] <ch3mical> Except you'll have to copy/paste the css in manually
[01:51:22] <Tallisman> did we just throw 3 different links O.o?
[01:51:25] <ch3mical> And the graphics won't show up
[01:51:55] <ch3mical> Unless you convert them to base64 and include them in the css... lawl
[01:52:07] <_beau> cant you just @import the CSS without copying it all?
[01:52:25] <Tallisman> I believe you can..
[01:52:27] <ch3mical> _beau: on jsfiddle?
[01:53:20] <DannyZB> http://jsfiddle.net/Ub7u6/
[01:53:26] <DannyZB> can't get this thing to work
[01:53:39] <DannyZB> but the code will give you a clue what I want done
[01:53:58] <DannyZB> I want the thing to fire "click" events without changing the "checked" status of the control
[01:54:01] <Tallisman> sooo..
[01:54:09] <Tant102> Dont.
[01:54:18] <Tant102> Have your click events call a method that does whatever you want.
[01:54:20] <Tant102> And call that method instead.
[01:54:26] <DannyZB> thats the thing
[01:54:39] <DannyZB> I don't want it to change until something is finished in the background
[01:55:02] <DannyZB> for regular checkboxed e.preventDefault it works .. the only problem I have is with UI buttons
[01:55:20] <Tallisman> what you can do.., if you really want to, as i don't advice it. you should use something else :p, but anyhow, you set the checked box unchecked with jquery.
[01:55:32] <DannyZB> I tried it
[01:55:36] <DannyZB> doesn't work
[01:55:45] <DannyZB> only starts working after the second time it's clicked
[01:56:49] <DannyZB> it's something about the design of toggle buttons .. I can't put my finger on it
[01:59:01] <DannyZB> sooo there's no way to do it?
[01:59:21] <Tallisman> ofcourse there is a way
[01:59:46] <DannyZB> what is it?
[02:00:04] <gnarf> DannyZB: describe what you want...
[02:00:06] <gnarf> You want a button
[02:00:11] <gnarf> that when clicked _____
[02:00:45] <DannyZB> I want a toggle button .. that when clicked sends an ajax request to my server.. it it gets a positive answer it should change it's "checked" attr to true
[02:00:59] <DannyZB> before the server responds it shouldn't do anything
[02:01:18] <systemfault> Can't you just disable it?
[02:01:29] <DannyZB> but then it won't be clickable
[02:01:35] <DannyZB> whats the use in that
[02:01:41] <systemfault> Isn't that the idea?
[02:01:55] <systemfault> Disable it while it does the ajax transaction
[02:02:11] <DannyZB> yea .. but it still changes before it's disabled
[02:02:15] <DannyZB> I tried it
[02:02:44] <gnarf> DannyZB: a) stop thinking about a "toggle" button
[02:02:45] <systemfault> A bit difficult to help without seeing anything.
[02:02:50] <gnarf> this is not the behavior of a toggle
[02:03:05] <gnarf> I assume you want to decorate a checkbox right?
[02:03:12] <DannyZB> it does exactly what a toggle does .. just with a servers' approval
[02:03:23] <gnarf> right
[02:03:24] <DannyZB> something like that yea
[02:03:27] <gnarf> so
[02:03:38] <gnarf> you have an input that you hide
[02:03:42] <gnarf> and a button that you create
[02:03:50] <gnarf> that when clicked - sends an ajax
[02:03:59] <gnarf> the response sets the value of the checkbox (which you hid)
[02:04:04] <DannyZB> no!
[02:04:11] <DannyZB> $("#checkbox-id").button()
[02:04:12] <gnarf> and sets the "ui-state-active" state on the button
[02:04:13] <ch3mical> omfsm
[02:04:32] <DannyZB> thats it .. no button and no "hidden" checkbox
[02:04:47] <ch3mical> Wow
[02:04:52] <ch3mical> Just "wow"
[02:05:00] <ch3mical> lol
[02:05:03] <gnarf> DannyZB: var cb = $("#checkbox-id").hide(), button = $("<div>Label</div>").button().before(cb).click( fn );
[02:05:19] <DannyZB> thats what checkbox.button does?
[02:05:25] <DannyZB> ok that solves the problem thanks ><
[02:05:47] <DannyZB> and stop treating people who don't know like idiots chemical .. if everybody was an expert there wouldn't be a chat here
[02:06:16] <ch3mical> Dude... wtf... pidgin is pissing me off
[02:06:20] <gnarf> DannyZB: fn = function() { $.ajax( ... ).done(function( data ) { if (data == "ok") { cb.get(0).checked = true; button.addClass('ui-state-active'); } }); };
[02:06:27] <ch3mical> The userlist keeps spazzing out
[02:06:47] <systemfault> ch3mical: Use a real client then :/ Like xchat :/
[02:07:05] <ch3mical> I'm at work, so, uhh.. no linux :'(
[02:07:18] <DannyZB> gnarf I got it thanks .. I built a pretty cool jquery image viewer for my app maybe I'll drop it to your lists
[02:07:39] <Tallisman> mirc > pidgin WHERE os = 'windows'
[02:07:42] <DannyZB> zoom+preview+switch-image+switch_background+navigation
[02:07:50] <ch3mical> mirc lol
[02:07:56] <Tallisman> lol
[02:08:02] <DannyZB> lol
[02:08:04] <systemfault> mirc is better though..
[02:08:15] <systemfault> Too bad it's not free.
[02:08:26] <ch3mical> And not teh sux
[02:08:28] <Tallisman> It is free :], lol
[02:08:30] <DannyZB> it's free for whoever doesn't pay for it "ahem"
[02:08:51] <Tallisman> 30 day trial never runs out :D
[02:08:55] <DannyZB> lol
[02:09:04] <ch3mical> Screw you guys... I"m gonna boot up a vm and run BitchX
[02:09:08] <ch3mical> hah!
[02:09:10] <DannyZB> "please stop using winrar and pay us 50$ .. it's not nice"
[02:09:18] <systemfault> ch3mical: irssi, KTHX
[02:09:31] <Tallisman> also tryed irssi
[02:09:42] <Tallisman> and irc firefox plugin thingy
[02:09:43] <ch3mical> But BitchX is all... retro... and stuff...
[02:09:49] <ch3mical> Yeah.......
[02:09:50] <systemfault> Yeah :/
[02:10:01] <DannyZB> why don't you just use the freenode web-chat?
[02:10:06] <ch3mical> irssi is definitely nice though..
[02:10:17] <Tallisman> BitchX is retro and stuff
[02:10:22] <Tallisman> then what is Irssi?
[02:10:22] <DannyZB> it's pretty nifty for a web-app
[02:10:25] <Tallisman> uber retro?
[02:10:33] <Tallisman> for a web-app?
[02:10:39] <Tallisman> seriously xD?
[02:10:39] <ravenzz> you could go for an emulate instance of mIRC
[02:10:43] <systemfault> irssi running in a screen running on an always-on server is the best thing ever.
[02:10:47] <ch3mical> I have a feeling if this conversation goes much further we'll be discussing emacs and erc again lol
[02:10:59] <Tallisman> you can pretty much do everything on the web nowadays :P
[02:11:04] <DannyZB> lol what ... it writes and receives messages
[02:11:13] <ch3mical> Tallisman: tell me about it.. I own the cr-48 ;)
[02:11:24] <Tallisman> cr-48?
[02:11:27] <DannyZB> I never wanted MIRC to cook me dinner and keep in contact with my friends .. apps are getting too bloated nowadays
[02:11:29] <systemfault> chromebook..
[02:11:38] <ch3mical> The ChromeOS pilot unit
[02:11:41] <Tallisman> what is chromebook O.o
[02:11:46] <ch3mical> omfsm
[02:11:52] <ch3mical> *facepalm*
[02:11:55] <Tallisman> seriously xD?
[02:11:57] <DannyZB> ChromeOS is gonna be the biggest flop since Google Wave
[02:12:03] <ravenzz> DannyZB mIRC is not bloated at all
[02:12:03] <DannyZB> publicity nonsense
[02:12:07] <ch3mical> You're wrong
[02:12:20] <systemfault> DannyZB: I think it's toon early for that kind of computer
[02:12:24] <Tallisman> you work at google ch3mical?
[02:12:28] <DannyZB> exactly
[02:12:29] <clarkbox> dannyzb have you ever seen anyone over 30 use a computer
[02:12:29] <systemfault> s/toon/too
[02:12:31] <ch3mical> Tallisman: no
[02:12:35] <ch3mical> Tallisman: I wish
[02:12:39] <DannyZB> lol my dad
[02:12:46] <clarkbox> what apps does he use?
[02:12:49] <ch3mical> clarkbox: I'm over 30 T_T
[02:12:54] <Tallisman> my mother uses a computer
[02:12:56] <DannyZB> SKype
[02:13:01] <DannyZB> he lives and breathes that stuff
[02:13:03] <Tallisman> shes a noob, but 45
[02:13:06] <clarkbox> no reason that cant be in a browser
[02:13:13] <gnarf> clarkbox: i also, am over 30 :)
[02:13:17] <DannyZB> SKype is super comfortable to use
[02:13:20] <ch3mical> clarkbox: it is (not as skype, but yeah)
[02:13:22] <systemfault> Why would someone use a chromebook when he could use a ipad-style device?
[02:13:24] <clarkbox> 90% of peeps are fine with a chromebook
[02:13:26] <Tallisman> y u so OLD?
[02:13:36] <DannyZB> mIRC is identical to the webchat in usability ...
[02:13:37] <Tallisman> I feel young :')
[02:13:48] <clarkbox> sorry... bad stereotye with the +30
[02:13:49] <ch3mical> Think about it, what do you spend 90% of your time "on the internet" doing??
[02:13:54] <ravenzz> DannyZB ahah wtf
[02:13:59] <ch3mical> Staring at a browser, I guarantee you
[02:14:00] <Tallisman> programming.
[02:14:09] <DannyZB> I know I know "this tech that tech blah blah"
[02:14:16] <clarkbox> systemfault chromebook IS ipade-style
[02:14:27] <DannyZB> who cares about that stuff.. it's a chat - needs to read and write .. end of story
[02:14:27] <ch3mical> No it's not, lol wtf
[02:14:41] <systemfault> clarkbox: It's more of a netbook
[02:14:48] <DannyZB> Thats exactly why iPhone still deserves to be on top .. it's comfortable to use
[02:14:58] <Tallisman> Well, I know I won't be having a chromebook lol
[02:14:59] <ch3mical> DannyZB: you're just babbling nonsense at this point
[02:15:11] <ravenzz> :D
[02:15:13] <DannyZB> lol I hurt your google feelings?
[02:15:37] <DannyZB> I know how techies take this stuff personally but I still believe tech needs to be made for the simple guy .. not the tech guru
[02:15:37] <clarkbox> dannyzb go use a iphone/ipad and keep up with a busy irc convo
[02:15:47] <ravenzz> mIRC rule. i did create some scripts when i was 15
[02:15:50] <Tallisman> macOS, maybe, Windows, Hell yea, Linux, yap, Android, cool, iOS, nice, chromeOS, euhm.....
[02:15:50] <ch3mical> Stop trolling, troll
[02:15:51] <clarkbox> dannyzb... thats what a chromebook is all about
[02:16:03] <DannyZB> lol chemical doesn't like me
[02:16:16] <ch3mical> Believe whatever you want
[02:16:17] <DannyZB> I know what it's about .. I love what google does to tech it's a great company
[02:16:28] <DannyZB> but chromebook? nobody needs that right now
[02:16:40] <clarkbox> bah
[02:16:41] <systemfault> In the future, I see ipad-style device that you simply dock to a hardware keyboard when you're in front of your desk..
[02:16:42] <Tallisman> if the marketing of chromebook is fine, I think it might actually work out.
[02:16:59] <ch3mical> systemfault: it's been done a hundred times over
[02:17:01] <Tallisman> systemfault, what about a chip?
[02:17:06] <Tallisman> ;p
[02:17:10] <DannyZB> I dunno .. wouldn't put my money on it .. I think it's gonna be borderline in terms of profit
[02:17:23] <clarkbox> look at windows 8
[02:17:36] <clarkbox> they are trying the same shit with JS/html5 as the new UX
[02:17:42] <systemfault> clarkbox: Windows 8 is optimizer for ipad-style devices.
[02:17:48] <systemfault> *optimized
[02:17:54] <ravenzz> with the iCloud launch is going to kill the core of the ChromeBook project
[02:17:58] <ravenzz> by my opinion
[02:17:59] <systemfault> Not chromebook style netbooks
[02:18:05] <ravenzz> iCloud is what We need.
[02:18:16] <ravenzz> and i am sad because i haven't a mac.
[02:18:16] <Tallisman> i don't need iCloud..
[02:18:17] <clarkbox> ravenzz icloud prooves the chromebook
[02:18:29] <clarkbox> its just apple catching up to goog with some datacetners and sync
[02:18:37] <ch3mical> agree @clarkbox
[02:18:40] <ravenzz> clarkbox yep but..in the Apple's way
[02:18:46] <ravenzz> that's even better.
[02:18:50] <ch3mical> *barf*
[02:18:58] <clarkbox> !
[02:19:05] <Tallisman> in a few decades microsoft, apple, they are all going to be myths
[02:19:10] <Tallisman> opensource ftw.
[02:19:16] <DannyZB> I'm out .. what the world needs is less tech before we have 18 cameras in every street .. it's spinning out of control
[02:19:24] <DannyZB> cya
[02:19:24] <clarkbox> now i know why i stay out of this channel ;)
[02:19:28] <ch3mical> Tallisman: lol, not so... coming from an avid opensource supporter
[02:19:44] <Tallisman> :p
[02:20:10] <Tallisman> DannyZB, why? got something to hide ;p?
[02:20:14] <systemfault> It's not really opensource that will win..
[02:20:15] <ch3mical> I think DannyZB is a little paranoid
[02:20:16] <systemfault> It's the web.
[02:20:28] <systemfault> OSes are going to become irrelevant.
[02:20:30] <Tallisman> No, I am fine with all kinds of tech unless people are putting cams in my house.
[02:20:35] <ch3mical> systemfault: the web is open :)
[02:21:35] <Tallisman> I just cannot WAIT untill those damn cars driving on gas are GONE.
[02:21:45] <ch3mical> Why does grooveshark always crash on me? :(
[02:22:06] <systemfault> Tallisman: Not going to happen.
[02:22:14] <Tallisman> unfortunatly not :P
[02:22:27] <systemfault> Tallisman: Too many powerful people making money behind that :)
[02:22:37] <Tallisman> but alternative cars are not difficult to make, might sit down a month and make my own :p
[02:22:56] <Tallisman> driving on air is pretty easy, as is electricity :P
[02:23:52] <ch3mical> So.... how about them Yankees?
[02:24:23] * Tallisman looks @ ch3mical, what about them?
[02:25:00] <ch3mical> I heard they scored a good fieldkick in the last quarter and the pointguard scored a touchdown...
[02:25:27] <ch3mical> (man, I love hockey)

[02:27:55] <ch3mical> OK, I'm done
[02:28:02] <ch3mical> Mission accomplished
[02:28:08] <macheleon> my god she looks like a doll
[02:28:14] <macheleon> figurine even
[02:28:15] <ch3mical> Everyone move along, nothing to see here.
[02:28:24] <ch3mical> Right?
[02:28:28] <Tallisman> you could add a NOT SAVE FOR WORK notion..
[02:28:35] <Tallisman> my boss just came by :]
[02:28:37] <ch3mical> That's totally SFW
[02:28:50] <macheleon> debatable
[02:28:51] <Tallisman> meh, i'm a lier, I am a lazy ass student.
[02:29:03] <ch3mical> Well, it's totally safe for my work, lol
[02:29:14] <Tallisman> :}
[02:29:26] <macheleon> same here
[02:29:52] <macheleon> infact it's better, if the mother in law is passing by it might prompt her to get the hell outta my office
[02:29:54] <ch3mical> This is my job:  http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSgukLhll2zbOT6n2idqiUSPfLd5jnyWhzr9opyrqnVur4uNJmY&t=1

[02:41:57] <Tallisman> Oh america, u so funneh.
[02:44:14] <systemfault> It's bad how USian fouled the word "american"
[02:44:32] <Tallisman> :]
[02:45:08] <khaan> hi everybody: i'm trying to simulate a click on a menu item to make a function being executed. I was trying something like jQuery('#Home > a').trigger('click'); but it's not working. Any idea?=
[02:45:31] <systemfault> Technically.. I'm a canadian and I live in north america.. so I'm an american.
[02:45:53] <systemfault> khaan: Just try .click()
[02:46:17] <Tallisman> anyhow, .trigger is teh way.
[02:46:27] <khaan> didn't work
[02:46:33] <systemfault> Ah :/
[02:46:43] <khaan> it's a menu
[02:46:49] <khaan> i need to simulate to click on a menu voice
[02:46:53] <systemfault> Then your selector isn't good?
[02:47:01] <coldhead> there was only one true american. and he died on the cross.
[02:47:01] <khaan> the id of the menu voice is #Home
[02:47:08] <systemfault> coldhead: Haha
[02:47:23] <khaan> do i need to specify more?
[02:47:29] <systemfault> coldhead: Djeezus?
[02:48:05] <systemfault> Djeezus the republican, defender of all the Sarah Palins of america!!
[02:48:25] <systemfault> Ok.. 6am.. I'm dead tired, take care all :)
[02:50:43] <coldhead> sweet dreams systemfault
[02:58:59] <Acriax> Hi, I'm a newbie to jquery, and I was wondering if it is possible to scale an image unproportionally using it, or would I have to use something like canvas in order to do that?
[03:03:06] <Woet> Acriax: sure?
[03:03:11] <Woet> you wouldn't even need jquery for that?
[03:03:17] <Woet> css width/height
[03:03:31] <Acriax> I would like to animate it as well
[03:04:03] <Acriax> I tried $(this).css("height", $(this).height()/2); but that resized the whole image proportionally
[03:04:27] <Woet> to animate, it's http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[03:04:37] <Woet> it has some examples width height
[03:05:03] <Acriax> Ah thanks, I'll look it over. Would http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Scale work on an image or only on div tags?
[03:05:52] <Woet> i'd expect it to work on everything that supports height
[03:12:03] <Acriax> Woet, yet again $('img').animate({height: '500px'}, 5000, function() { }); scales the whole thing proportionally :/
[03:12:10] <Woet> hmm, okay
[03:12:20] <Woet> and what if you set the width too?
[03:12:28] <Woet> height: '500px', width: '10px'
[03:12:35] <Woet> or
[03:12:42] <Acriax> oh that did it! :D
[03:12:45] <Woet> yay!
[03:12:47] <Acriax> yayy
[03:12:54] <Woet> height: '500px', width: $(this).width()
[03:12:56] <Woet> would be better i suppose
[03:13:45] <Acriax> Woet, no that just makes it proportional again :p
[03:13:52] <Woet> okay
[03:13:55] <Woet> then set it hard coded
[03:13:57] <Woet> :)
[03:13:58] <Acriax> yup
[03:13:59] <Woet> or
[03:14:07] <Woet> var height = $(this).height();
[03:14:09] <Woet> then animate it
[03:14:10] <Woet> with that variable
[03:14:18] <Woet> since it would have stored it's old height
[03:14:26] <Woet> but you could just hard code it if its not a problem
[03:14:28] <Acriax> ah, that might work
[03:19:27] <icio> I'm looking into why jQuery returns different values of the (inner/outer)height of my content after I've called slideUp() on the container element. This is a problem because subsequently calling slideDown means that it tweens to the wrong height before setting to "auto" and there's a visible jump
[03:19:57] <icio> Can anybody offer any advice regarding this problem?
[03:30:15] <Lundy> anyone here use the Masked Input plugin? im having a slight problem with it ...
[03:31:28] <Lundy> im using Version: 1.3, and when I do this .. 	$("#dob").mask("99/99/9999", {placeholder: " "}); what happens is if you type in the Date format. 19/08/87 and tab onto the next one ... it goes blank... what im wanting to do is call a error there :s but dunno if its a bug in the plugin or my code
[03:31:44] <aidan> Anyone know what this stuff is? http://dpaste.com/553353/
[03:32:00] <aidan> I believe it has something to do with rapheal, but I'm not sure how to translate/edit it
[03:40:40] <elex> Hi, I hot a little problem with .text(var). I am getting an variable from a postrequest (works, can show by alert). and want to pass it to an div with $("#reply").text(reply); It doesnt work. If I set reply by hand it works. any hints?
[03:40:54] <elex> Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.
[03:41:53] <Woet> elex: www.jsfiddle.net
[03:44:17] <elex> Woet: ?
[03:44:26] <Woet> elex: put your html/css/js on www.jsfiddle.net
[03:45:26] <Lundy> save and give us the link to view it
[03:46:21] <icio> aidan: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathDataGeneralInformation
[03:47:48] <elex> I will do sobut it won't work.. backend is on local server..
[03:48:30] <icio> If it's a client-side problem you just need to recreate it in a way that'll demonstrate the problem
[03:49:55] <coldhead> maybe marilyn shot JFK
[03:56:26] <Lundy> anyone able to help me?
[03:56:32] <elex> I Pasted it on pastebin http://pastebin.com/YZKhLBpL The Alert works as expected. If I set var reply =  "foo" replacement works.  I think it's an absolute beginners failure
[03:57:59] <Lundy> elex: try       $("#reply").html(reply);
[03:58:02] <coldhead> elex: why are you using arrays?
[03:58:29] <coldhead> var reply = $('lol').whatever() should suffice
[03:58:44] <coldhead> not reply = [$('lol').whatever()]
[03:59:11] <elex> coldhead:   Basically I wanted all results inone Array.  I will correct it in the next step
[03:59:51] <coldhead> then mayb you need $("#reply").text(reply.pop())
[04:00:02] <coldhead> or reply[0]
[04:01:38] <elex> with attatched index it works.  I'm just courious that it is not needet at alert...
[04:01:43] <elex> Thanks man
[04:01:50] <coldhead> alert() is crazy
[04:15:03] <icio> elex: because `alert` will manually call .toString() on what's passed to it
[04:15:22] <icio> ["a"].toString() == "a"; ["a", "b"].toString() == "a,b";

[04:34:29] <iszak> Has that bitch Ruby taken over your life yet?
[04:35:30] <coldhead> life  persists
[04:35:55] <coldhead> ruby hasn't taken over yet but we're getting to be on pretty good terms
[04:36:11] <coldhead> this isn't a long weekend in WA i heard?
[04:36:17] <iszak> nope, we had that last weekend.
[04:36:25] <coldhead> ah okay
[04:36:35] <coldhead> justice
[04:36:44] <iszak> I had to work on Monday anyway, so no long weekend for me, no work, no pay.
[04:44:06] <coldhead> dagnabit!
[04:44:09] <coldhead> that is unasutralian!
[04:44:19] <coldhead> liek my spelink
[04:45:02] <iszak> coldhead, you heard the new craze? planking is old now
[04:45:18] <coldhead> what's the new one then?
[04:45:23] <coldhead> i didn't even try planking!
[04:45:29] <iszak> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WygNjMSllLQ Cone-ing
[04:46:25] <coldhead> >_>
[04:47:06] <iszak> coldhead, you've got to try it!
[04:49:49] <Ely2> Hi, when I do a request on an xml file i get the following error: Origin .... s not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[04:51:27] <coldhead> ?sop
[04:51:27] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[04:52:33] <coldhead> this is too hardcore for me
[04:52:39] <coldhead> i don't like having sticky hands
[04:52:49] <iszak> coldhead, come on! be a man
[04:52:52] <iszak> do it atleast once.
[04:52:58] <coldhead> hahah
[04:53:03] <coldhead> can i do it drunk?
[04:53:06] <iszak> sure
[04:53:09] <iszak> but you've got to remember it
[04:53:11] <coldhead> it IS better than planking, i see that
[04:53:34] <iszak> I know, you actually get food out of it
[04:55:38] <Ely2> sigh don't get it :p
[05:15:46] <sullivan0> is there  jquery ui channel...?
[05:16:07] <iszak> #jqueryui
[05:16:11] <sullivan0> tried
[05:16:23] <iszak> is it dead?
[05:16:40] <sullivan0> oh yes its deader than Osama
[05:16:48] <iszak> then just ask in here
[05:18:10] <sullivan0> ok... I was just wondering why hovers for ui-button etc were .js only and why nothing was done using :hover psuedo... not to mention why there are quite a lot of wierd selector in the framework code that are essentially redudant
[05:19:07] <iszak> compatibility with IE6 I dare say
[05:19:20] <iszak> because IE6 doesn't support :hover pseudo on anything other than anchors
[05:19:30] <sullivan0> ahha :)
[05:19:56] <sullivan0> but surely it would make sense to use hover and for those using IE6 to implement the js
[05:20:46] <iszak> then you'll need 2x selectors
[05:20:51] <iszak> err actualy no
[05:20:56] <sullivan0> i.e. for browsers that support you get automatic hover UI and for js you ust write js slecotrs
[05:20:56] <iszak> well yes, you would
[05:21:14] <iszak> 2x the selectors, honestly I can't say why they chose that method, but it's not a big deal and it's the way it is for now
[05:22:21] <sullivan0> yeah its nothing really I just wondered why :) thanks for answer
[05:25:22] <sullivan0> iszak -> example of redundant selectors
[05:25:28] <sullivan0> .ui-state-error, .ui-widget-content .ui-state-error, .ui-widget-header .ui-state-error{...}
[05:26:24] <sullivan0> i cant believe thats a IE6 failure...
[05:26:36] <iszak> sullivan0, I don't think that example is, I was speaking the hover state is.
[05:26:54] <iszak> for the "redundant selectors" I say they're not, they're designed to be reusable and flexible and that's why there is so many of them
[05:27:22] <iszak> sullivan0, I honestly would not worry too much, just minify and gzip your CSS and you won't notice a difference.
[05:27:41] <Robbington> Hi guys, I am new to Jquery and was wondering if someone could help me with something.
[05:27:48] <Tant102> Robbington, probably.
[05:28:02] <iszak> ?ask @ Robbington
[05:28:03] <bot-t> Robbington, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:28:21] <Robbington> I have a list of countries, in a table and a hidden <tr> with a list of cities for each country
[05:28:23] <sullivan0> iszak - Yeah I know Im not too bothered I was just writing some LessCss -> JqueryUI libraries and noticed these seemed very odd to me
[05:28:48] <Robbington> generated by a php array
[05:29:05] <Robbington> I need to be able to have a click event for each drop down.
[05:29:10] <Robbington> but I cant get it to work.
[05:29:27] <Robbington> I am using jQuery.each(cities, function() {  where cities is the name of the array
[05:29:45] <Robbington> and then  $("." + this).click(function(){
[05:29:51] <Robbington>  $("#" + this).show('slow');
[05:29:57] <sullivan0> Robbington is that your selector? jQuery.???
[05:30:18] <sullivan0> ahh i see
[05:30:21] <Robbington> Ahh, you see new to Jquery.
[05:30:26] <Robbington> Thats where I am going wrong
[05:30:44] <sullivan0> how about post your html
[05:30:51] <sullivan0> www.pastie.com
[05:31:10] <wib> http://pastie.org
[05:31:17] <sullivan0> w/e
[05:31:26] <wib> big difference
[05:31:37] <sullivan0> true
[05:34:11] <Robbington> Cool, thanks. Any help would be great
[05:34:12] <Robbington> http://pastebin.com/1Qm9k8J6
[05:34:33] <lux`> what event does an input box trigger when it get the keyboard focus?
[05:35:00] <walid> hi all! what is the correct syntax to add jquery code directly in the html (<a href="" onclick="myJqueryFunction">)
[05:36:02] <Robbington> I think you define your onclick events in your code rather than html, walid. Not that I am and an expert.
[05:36:15] <walid> Robbington: hm
[05:36:33] <sullivan0> Robbington - I think you are maybe missing the point. You are iterating an array (not a set of dom elements) and assigning a click event to those... you need to iterate the HTML dom and  assign the event there
[05:36:52] <walid> i just need a really small code to run once(on home page, fade in the content when clicking on welcome)
[05:36:59] <Robbington> Ahh, of course.
[05:37:17] <Robbington> I is rubbish at Javascript. lol.
[05:39:19] <Juzzy> walid, that's pretty easy.
[05:40:05] <Juzzy> just 2 divs, one starts hidden, the other doesnt. on click, switch the 2 using fade() jquery function
[05:40:15] <sullivan0> thats okay Robbington :) you need to get the HTML elements. I notice you have no class or id on your table so it makes the selector quite brittle but something like $('table>tr>td').each(function(){...});
[05:40:47] <Juzzy> http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/fading/
[05:41:06] <shaggy_> Anyone know how to get jqueryUI to work with mootools?
[05:41:26] <walid> Juzzy: yep. how do i insert that code directly into the html, in the onclick attribute?
[05:41:38] <walid> do i need to add it as a script, in the <head>?
[05:42:04] <Robbington> For some reason struggling to get my head around all this javascipt. Php no probs.
[05:42:12] <Robbington> I was a bit confused by this tutorial: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[05:43:27] <sullivan0> Robbington : jQuery.each is for easy traversal of MEMORY arrays (i.e. JSON etc) and $().each is for easy traversal of DOM arrays (i.e. html elements
[05:43:34] <Robbington> where they define the array prior, and then iterating though each item.
[05:44:39] <juha____> coldhead: hey aussie bastard, are you awake?
[05:44:49] <sullivan0> you need $('.myClassSelector').each() which 'gets all HTML elements with class=myClassSelector and execute the function for each
[05:45:26] <coldhead> just barely, juha____
[05:45:36] <coldhead> happy sunday, you gentle norseman
[05:46:33] <Wiz_KeeD> is it hard to implement this simple plugin (the one with the input field at the top) http://jquery.bassistance.de/tooltip/demo/ ?
[05:47:16] <juha____> coldhead: if you're not too drunk, would you like to check this plugin that i've been coding for couple of days
[05:48:02] <coldhead> oh hey yes i read about that
[05:48:04] <coldhead> show show show
[05:48:43] <juha____> http://dasmusik.org/yaeipp/aids.html
[05:48:49] <juha____> i know you like the url <3
[05:48:58] <coldhead> i LOLed
[05:50:20] <sullivan0> juha____ you can't click and move the carat when editing the text you can only use the navigation keys
[05:50:45] <juha____> sullivan0: what browser?
[05:51:04] <coldhead> YAEIPP <333
[05:51:07] <coldhead> so much code
[05:51:15] <juha____> yet another edit-in-place plugin
[05:51:15] <juha____> :D
[05:51:22] <coldhead> i guessed that!
[05:51:32] <coldhead> looks good in chrome, babe
[05:52:00] <juha____> hmm, google chrome on windows handles .focus() differently than chromium in ubuntu, interesting
[05:52:46] <coldhead> looks like your debugging work is all ready for you today
[05:52:49] <sullivan0> juha____ FF3.6
[05:53:08] <juha____> sullivan0: ok, testing
[05:53:14] <sullivan0> juha____ np
[05:53:17] <juha____> i've only tested this on ubuntu, so let's see
[05:53:37] <juha____> sullivan0: oh i see!
[05:53:45] <juha____> sullivan0: it's the a element that's the problem
[05:53:46] <juha____> hmmmm
[05:53:55] <sullivan0> its firing YAEIPP_createForm when the form has been created
[05:54:19] <juha____> i thought i fixed that
[05:54:29] <sullivan0> apparently not juha____
[05:54:30] <sullivan0> :)
[05:54:49] <juha____> apparently
[05:57:50] <juha____> oh yeah, it fires the function call, but inside the function there's a check if it's input or not, so it's not rendering the form more than once.. but that a element problem is major, atleas on ff
[05:59:31] <sullivan0> juha____ - I reckon you might want to create the form outside the a... I think it's a bubbling issue
[06:00:00] <juha____> yes
[06:06:33] <bluey> got dc'd :<
[06:07:50] <Guest89704> juha____ did you get my comment about .stopPropogation? or moving the form outside the a?
[06:08:53] <juha____> Guest89704: nope i don't think so
[06:09:37] <juha____> i'm currently wrapping the element in span, but after saving it doesn't return as a element, fixing that atm
[06:10:20] <ezl> i want to make it so that an event continues to fire while the user has his mouse clicked.
[06:10:33] <ezl> i tried .mousedown() but that seems to behave just like .click()
[06:10:59] <ezl> I want to continue scrolling while they are holding down the button
[06:11:07] <ezl> how should i achieve that?
[06:18:52] <liquid-silence> is there a treeview plugin that has context menuS?
[06:19:01] <Guest89704> ezl you have to start a setInterval function, set a mouseDown flag and bind the mouseUp,mouseLeave to another function that clears teh flag an stops the interval (which is where your scrolling funciton goes
[06:19:16] <RobertX> If I use load('test.php') will and have a form in there with a php code, when I perform the action will it process the php?
[06:20:06] <ezl> thanks guest
[06:26:32] <guy> assuming I have a table <td width=200 /><td /><td />; how do I make remaining two columns share the remaining width equally – is there jquery plugin for that?
[06:30:27] <juha____> whoa, now the a element should be working properly!
[06:30:34] <juha____> thanks for the feedback guys <3
[06:37:34] <Guest89704> np juha____
[06:37:45] <Guest89704> ... signout tastic...
[06:39:43] <RobertX> If I use load('test.php') will and have a form in there with a php code, when I perform the action will it process the php?
[06:41:06] <juha____> RobertX: yes, it will run the php
[06:41:17] <RobertX> Thank you
[06:41:52] <juha____> RobertX: ofc this is really easy to test ;)
[06:42:36] <RobertX> Is it possible to run a server side timer in javascript/jquery?
[06:42:43] <juha____> yes
[06:43:23] <RobertX> <script runat="server"></script>  ?
[06:43:39] <juha____> RobertX: simplest way is to use setInterval(), which will fire your ajax call, calling the server every second
[06:43:55] <juha____> RobertX: ofc this will use more resources, but it's the simplest/easiest wau to do it
[06:43:58] <RobertX> But isnt it client side?
[06:44:30] <juha____> RobertX: it will get your timer from the server every second
[06:45:07] <juha____> RobertX: you can also have time comparisons in the client side, but those are easiers to falsify than server side timers
[06:45:50] <RobertX> basically I want the jquery to run a php code every half an hour to update the page content from the server side
[06:46:38] <juha____> setInterval(function() { $.ajax(); }, 1800000);
[06:47:01] <RobertX> ty :)
[06:47:35] <juha____> RobertX: you should google setInterval and setTimeout, because they are pretty powerful tools
[06:47:46] <juha____> read couple of articles about the,
[06:47:50] <juha____> *them
[06:49:07] <juha____> ugh, why can't carousel plugin makers preload images properly :P
[06:49:11] <RobertX> I was thinking that setInterval would run from the client side
[06:49:22] <RobertX> Like it will call the timer when the page loads for the client
[06:49:34] <RobertX> So every client will have different timers
[06:49:51] <juha____> RobertX: you can easily sync them
[06:50:43] <juha____> RobertX: first pageview gets time from server, then you do some math in client and then you can do setTimeout based on that, and when the timeout is runned, you can have setInterval in the end of that function ;)
[06:51:34] <juha____> RobertX: ofc if you serve some sort of cached content, you could easily call it more often than 30 minutes, but keep on updating it every 30 minutes
[06:56:08] <ch3mical> What would be the best way to work with xml data that has this format: <some:thing>string</some:thing> ?
[06:56:25] <ch3mical> The colons are throwing me off, I think
[06:56:30] <ch3mical> Not sure how to get around that
[06:57:12] <ch3mical> Assume that this xml is an object
[06:57:18] <ch3mical> Not a string
[06:57:55] <Tant102> ch3mical, those are xml namespaces.
[06:58:13] <Tant102> a:tag may be different from b:tag, if a and b has different namespaces.
[06:58:48] <ch3mical> Right, well how do I get js/jq to find the data in the namespace?
[06:58:49] <Tant102> ch3mical; http://www.xml.com/pub/a/1999/01/namespaces.html
[06:59:03] <ch3mical> I know what it is, that's not my problem
[06:59:26] <ch3mical> My this is an API response, so I'm just trying to figure out how to use the data

[07:00:25] <Famic> hi
[07:01:45] <ch3mical> I mean, I could just replace ":" with "" and be good
[07:01:48] <Famic> I have a svg file and I'd like to use its paths as a value in a json object. Any idea how I could do so ?
[07:02:05] <Famic> I mean the transformation from one to the other
[07:02:37] <ch3mical> Isn't SVG an image file?
[07:02:40] <Ely2> Hi .. I have this xml request and the 'link' and 'imageurl' is returning undefined. js + xml: http://jsfiddle.net/mXe7a/  // Live: http://yougodigital.be/BoinxxFeeder/index.html (summer)
[07:02:58] <Ely2> he finds the title
[07:03:03] <Ely2> but the rest is present inside the xml file
[07:03:17] <Famic> ch3mical: it is, but it's vector based and can appear in the dom as such
[07:03:27] <Famic> looks like xml when you open the file
[07:03:35] <Famic> actually it is
[07:04:06] <ch3mical> Weird. I've never looked at SVG contents
[07:04:23] <PastorBones> I have a div being ajaxed with jquery...however some people are complaining that all they see is loading. What could it be? It works fine from my end so hard for me to debug
[07:04:40] <Famic> ch3mical: http://pastebin.com/LKS6ibmZ
[07:04:56] <PastorBones> www.fortpastor.com/map/view <--- here is where the problem lies
[07:05:00] <Famic> you'll be amazed ;)
[07:05:09] <ch3mical> Yeah, that's really cool
[07:05:20] <ch3mical> Always wondered how SVG works
[07:06:12] <PastorBones> can someone help me out here?
[07:06:41] <PastorBones> I need someone who can recreate the problem and debug...works fine for me but some users are complaining that it never loads
[07:06:53] <Ely2> works fine here
[07:06:55] <ch3mical> PastorBones: map-control.pngFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
[07:06:57] <Famic> PastorBones: ask them which browser they use
[07:07:09] <Ely2> try to get some more data liek browsers and version
[07:07:14] <Famic> anyhow markup is so invalid I'm not surprised
[07:07:18] <PastorBones> map-control.png is in the top div, that one isn't ajaxed and that is a valid pic
[07:07:25] <ezl> i want to attach an event to all divs that have a certain class, but these divs are generating dynamically after page load (and can be created at any later time).  how do i do this?
[07:07:29] <Ely2> Hi .. I have this xml request and the 'link' and 'imageurl' is returning undefined. js + xml: http://jsfiddle.net/mXe7a/  // Live: http://yougodigital.be/BoinxxFeeder/index.html (summer)
[07:07:30] <PastorBones> Ely2: brb
[07:07:33] <Ely2> sorry for repeat
[07:07:39] <Ely2> but can't seem to find the problem :o
[07:08:40] <PastorBones> would Chrome incognito be causing it?
[07:08:59] <PastorBones> Chrome incognito v12.0.742.91
[07:09:01] <ch3mical> Ely2: you seem to have a variable that returns null or perhaps was misspelled: GET http://yougodigital.be/BoinxxFeeder/undefined 404 (Not Found)
[07:09:11] <ch3mical> Note the "undefined"
[07:09:31] <Ely2> i checked double
[07:09:33] <Ely2> they are there
[07:09:34] <PastorBones> Famic: did you say my markup was invalid?
[07:09:47] <Ely2> that's why i don't get it why they return null
[07:10:12] <Famic> PastorBones: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fortpastor.com%2Fmap%2Fview&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[07:11:12] <PastorBones> famic: that is wrong, my tags are closed
[07:11:21] <Ely2> ch3mical
[07:11:22] <Ely2> got it working
[07:11:31] <Famic> sure, w3c validator is faulty, not your code :p
[07:12:58] <PastorBones> no srsly, that's weird...
[07:13:11] <ezl> if i want to replace an event handler, is the best way to .unbind() then .bind() ?
[07:13:26] <PastorBones> it says it's missing the end tag
[07:13:27] <PastorBones> <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="<?= Router::baseUrl('public/images/'); ?>favicon.png">
[07:13:29] <PastorBones> it's there
[07:13:33] <ezl> specifically, i want to _replace_ the existing .click() handler
[07:13:51] <le_coeur> te
[07:14:01] <Famic> PastorBones: it's not
[07:14:22] <PastorBones> does the <link supposed to end in /> or something?
[07:14:31] <PastorBones> cuz I have the closing > on it
[07:14:47] <Famic> indeed
[07:15:06] <Famic> <a href="#"> texte for the link
[07:15:15] <Famic> does this seem closed to you ?
[07:15:51] <PastorBones> yeah...that fixed that error, but now it went from 17 to 27 errors...lol
[07:16:00] <Famic> > is not clsing a tag, it's making what's between < and > a tag
[07:16:01] <hsbot>   <hint>:1:20: parse error on input `,'
[07:16:05] <PastorBones> still that shouldn't cause Jquery to not ajax a div only for certain users
[07:16:30] <Famic> PastorBones: when your markup is invalid, everything can happen
[07:16:46] <PastorBones> hmmmm..I'll fix my markup then and we'll see
[07:16:58] <PastorBones> just weird how it works on my chrome but not there's
[07:20:14] <PastorBones> heh, code copied from facebook for the LIKE button is invalid
[07:21:10] <dabear> your mom is invalid
[07:21:12] <dabear> :)
[07:21:16] <ch3mical> wtf, I can't get a damn thing out of this xml response because of the stupid namespaces
[07:21:22] <Famic> yeah, it relies on unknow tags
[07:21:28] <Famic> don't worry too much about that one
[07:21:54] <dabear> ezl: unbind and rebind, yes
[07:22:47] <dabear> unbind('click');
[07:24:01] <PastorBones> famic, that's it then, the rest are unknown tags and attributes on the facebook st00f
[07:24:08] <PastorBones> does it still not work for you?
[07:24:28] <ezl> thanks dabear
[07:25:24] <Famic> PastorBones: I didn't say it wasn't working, you did
[07:25:33] <Famic> how does it behave when it breaks ?
[07:25:42] <PastorBones> yeah cuz users are complaining, it works fine for me always does
[07:25:54] <PastorBones> they say it just says Loading... and never loads
[07:26:13] <PastorBones> I can't get it to break to debug it, no errors on server, etc
[07:26:25] <Famic> ...
[07:26:36] <Ely2> anyone here has knowledge about xml and jquery mobile? Nobody is answering inside #jquerymobile
[07:26:37] <ezl> when using a selector to get by id $('#id') it returns a list with just the single item, so i end up having to type "[0]" to retrieve the item
[07:26:48] <Famic> what did your users say when they said it wasn't working ? didn't you ask them ?
[07:27:01] <ezl> is there a better way to do that? like i want to get the value of the inputbox with id #inputbox
[07:27:03] <Famic> "not working" has no meaning per se
[07:27:14] <ezl> (rather i want to set it)
[07:27:28] <Tant102> ezkl, $('#id').val()
[07:27:28] <PastorBones> it never loads
[07:27:31] <Tant102> exl*
[07:27:33] <Tant102> ezll*
[07:27:40] <Tant102> ffs. *goes away*
[07:27:43] <PastorBones> what else is a user supposed to say?
[07:27:44] <PastorBones> lol
[07:28:05] <ezl> Tant102: heh thanks
[07:28:17] <dabear> ezl: document.getElementById("id").value ;)
[07:28:28] <dabear> simpler and better if you need to access the dom element anyway
[07:28:35] <PastorBones> I was hoping someone in here that is technically minded could try and have the same problem
[07:28:59] <dabear> whats the issue?
[07:29:17] <PastorBones> www.fortpastor.com/map/view <---- the bottom half of the page is ajaxed, but for some users never loads
[07:29:26] <Famic> it "doesn't work" ;)
[07:29:30] <PastorBones> lol
[07:29:45] <ch3mical> Ok now it's working
[07:29:45] <PastorBones> the only one I got online right now is like a 14 yr old kid
[07:29:46] <ch3mical> yay
[07:29:52] <ch3mical> Stupid namespacing
[07:29:56] <Famic> PastorBones: there are js errors
[07:29:58] <Tant102> PastorBones, what bottom half?
[07:30:06] <dabear> what happens
[07:30:08] <dabear> whne
[07:30:11] <dabear> and what browser
[07:30:13] <ezl> dabear: once i use that to get the element, how can i use jquery to modify it?
[07:30:19] <PastorBones> Tant102: there is a top map and then a detailed portion of the selected area underneath it
[07:30:19] <Tant102> Bottom half of the squarish map?
[07:30:23] <ezl> that returns me a dom element, not a jquery object, right?
[07:30:40] <dabear> ezl: correct. use $("#id") if you need to use jquery
[07:30:52] <Famic> PastorBones: paste your js in jslint.com
[07:30:54] <PastorBones> Famic: what is the error? I dont' see any on my browser
[07:30:55] <Famic> and clean it too
[07:31:08] <Tant102> PastorBones, the bottom part wont update when I click the top one.
[07:31:33] <dabear> PastorBones: why are you trying to load a resource from localhost?
[07:31:34] <dabear> http://localhost/public/images/map/map-control.png
[07:31:36] <Famic> PastorBones: zoomToCursor: true,
[07:31:46] <PastorBones> oh really? hmmm..lol
[07:31:46] <Famic> there shouldn't be a , as it's the latest element
[07:31:48] <Famic> ie hates this
[07:31:58] <Famic> probably htere are others, though
[07:32:40] <ezl> last one: in what cases should .val() be used as opposed to .innerHTML ?
[07:32:44] <PastorBones> why is my router::baseurl function returning localhost? wtf?
[07:33:02] <Tant102> ezl, when you want the value.
[07:33:03] <Famic> ezl: .val is the value in a form
[07:33:09] <dabear> ezl: val is value, innerHTML is the html
[07:33:12] <Tant102> ezl, there's also .html() and .text() for innerhtml/innertext.
[07:33:13] <Famic> innerhtml is what it says
[07:34:52] <Famic> PastorBones: also, you should always use {} for if/for/while... loops
[08:11:09] <rockymontana> Hello people
[08:13:21] <rockymontana> Im running into problems when I try to use datepicker. I'm in Sweden and the standard is to write yy-mm-dd and not dd/mm/yy, and when I try to set the string to that it disappears when I have a preloaded date (like when I try to edit an already set date)...
[08:14:58] <rockymontana> to clarify a bit: If I use i.e $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker( "option", "dateFormat", "yy-mm-dd"); the input-box gets empty when I load the page with the value set. If it's empty it works fine tho
[08:15:05] <ezl> i want to output timestamps to the screen in the form hh:MM:ss
[08:15:32] <ezl> i'm using Date().getHours(), Date().getMinutes, etc, so sometimes i get times like 11:3:9
[08:15:43] <ezl> is there a smart way to get these as 11:03:09 ?
[08:17:21] <rockymontana> ezl: you want the current time?
[08:18:34] <ezl> rockymontana yes
[08:18:47] <ezl> i stream messages to the browser via socketio
[08:18:52] <ezl> i want to timestamp the messages
[08:19:05] <rockymontana> could this be something? (I'm hunting time-thingies as well)
[08:19:06] <rockymontana> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-what-is-new-date-in-the-function-now
[08:22:55] <ezl> thanks rocky
[08:23:41] <Famic> ezl: check date.toLocaleString()
[08:25:39] <ezl> thanks
[08:34:33] <vnikiet> hi!!
[08:34:39] <Tant102> bazinga!
[08:34:56] <vnikiet> im having a too much recursion problem on jquery
[08:35:13] <vnikiet> someone knows why is this problem appearing?
[08:35:19] <vnikiet> im using datapicker and validate plugins
[08:35:20] <vnikiet> hehe
[08:37:09] <imakewebthings> vnikiet: you're probably not taking event bubbling into account somewhere
[08:42:30] <Ely2> Is it possible to give an ajax request an url on clicking a link? so every link has it own url in the ajax request but uses the same code
[08:44:59] <eighty4> Ely2: jQuery('a').click(function(){$.ajax(url: foobar)})?
[08:45:29] <Ely2> every link wil have it's class or id or rel (don't know yet) and that should be passed through inside the url
[08:45:34] <Ely2> only the ID inside the url has to change
[08:46:31] <eighty4> Ely2: so in the click function assign url based on id/class/rel
[08:51:59] <Ely2> eighty4
[08:52:01] <Ely2> somethin like http://jsfiddle.net/7P2aM/ ?
[08:55:52] <Ely2> mmz is not working :p
[09:11:51] <Ely2> is there a way to display the current ajax get url inside an alert or console log ?
[09:13:13] <glen1> var ajaxurl="yoururl.com"; console.log(ajaxurl);  ?
[09:13:23] <glen1> then use ajaxurl in $.ajax
[09:24:40] <David_Bradbury> ie8 makes me want to jump off of a cliff. There aren't any cliffs around to jump off of though
[09:55:23] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/32vtS/
[09:55:56] <thomedy> im building a test jquery ive never used the css functions before i got my idea from jquery .com
[09:56:00] <thomedy> how close am i
[09:56:19] <thomedy> its not the end task to perform but step by step build to my eventuall goal with it
[09:58:07] <Ely2> I would like to add the REL of the link inside the ajax url http://jsfiddle.net/7P2aM/1/
[10:09:50] <Guest89704> thomedy... it works but its rather basic
[10:24:42] <eighty4> Ely2: http://jsfiddle.net/7P2aM/3/
[10:24:52] <Ely2> well it's working eighty4
[10:25:15] <Ely2> but have another problem
[10:25:24] <Ely2> my list get's populated every time i click a link
[10:25:41] <Ely2> so I click on link A it shows me all from ID1
[10:25:59] <Ely2> when I click on link B it adds all from ID2 and ID1 in the list
[10:26:06] <Ely2> it should only show all from one ID
[10:28:18] <Ely2> i think the problem is this $("#List").append(List);
[10:29:01] <BuddytheRat> Hello hello
[10:29:33] <BuddytheRat> Can anyone help me with a malfunctioning jQuery script?
[10:30:08] <BuddytheRat> anyone at all?
[10:30:32] <kojiro> BuddytheRat: please ask a more specific question
[10:30:40] <BuddytheRat> okay
[10:31:03] <BuddytheRat> I am trying to make a slider. Here is my code: http://pastebin.com/fs6eyiiY
[10:31:31] <BuddytheRat> When I remove the manageControls function, the click bind triggers the alert
[10:31:44] <BuddytheRat> when I leave it in
[10:31:46] <BuddytheRat> it does not
[10:32:05] <BuddytheRat> basically anything after using manageControls in the code does not happen
[10:32:26] <BuddytheRat> I cannot figure out why
[10:32:43] <oal> I'm trying to use jqueryui's "droppable", but the element I want to drop it on, is not recognized, I think, because it's being redrawen (knockout.js). How can I get around that?
[10:32:55] <oal> I also use jquery.tmpl with knockout
[10:34:54] <oal> I don't know what to search for, so if anyone got some keywords for me, I'd be very happy
[10:39:36] <ch3mical> Ok, I have something like var mystuff = { thisthing: function(callback) { mystuff.thatthing = callback; blah blah; mystuff.thathing(); }, thatthing: null }; mystuff.thisthing(function() { do something on callback });  am I doing that right?
[10:39:39] <ch3mical> lol
[10:39:59] <ch3mical> I've been awake for like 48 hrs at this point, so I'm sure I'm doing something silly
[10:40:27] <ch3mical> I just want to fire whatever function I put into the callback but it's not working
[10:41:44] <ch3mical> Looks like nobody is around, hmm
[10:43:24] <ThrushAAX> ch3mical: it looks OK to me
[10:44:00] <ThrushAAX> ch3mical: although you might want to do this.thatthing instead of mystuff.thatthing
[10:44:13] <ch3mical> Oh, good point
[10:44:30] <ch3mical> Not sure why the callback doesn't fire though...
[10:44:44] <ch3mical> Let me see if I can come up with a jsfiddle
[10:48:04] <joe2231> I'm trying to go from some divs inside of a div with id 'tabs' to a jquery-ui set of tabs, and am using this code: http://jsfiddle.net/p8pxU/2/  however, the code seems to be functioning as I'd expect it to, but doesn't actually cause the tabbed behavior
[10:49:13] <ryanneufeld> joe2231: your fiddle doesn't have the jquery-ui loaded
[10:49:36] <ch3mical> ThrushAAX: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zwudX/
[10:50:11] <ch3mical> Hmm
[10:50:31] <ch3mical> I know I'm doing something really obviously wrong here lol
[10:50:48] <ch3mical> Just want to finish this last subroutine before I get some sleep
[10:51:26] <joe2231> ryanneufeld: I'm not too familiar with jsfiddle, how do i do that?
[10:51:39] <ryanneufeld> on the left
[10:51:52] <ryanneufeld> where is says "Add Resourses"
[10:54:40] <joe2231> here's an updated fiddle with jquery-ui: http://jsfiddle.net/p8pxU/3/
[10:55:49] <ekkis> greets everyone.  I have a question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6323536/methods-for-a-specific-object-not-prototyped
[10:56:00] <ekkis> would someone take a peek?
[10:56:56] <jedimind> so the questions is if anyone would take a peek?
[10:58:05] <ryanneufeld> joe2231: what is it hat your trying to do?
[10:58:26] <ch3mical> Or, tell me what dumb mistake I'm making trying to create a callback function: http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zwudX/
[10:58:27] <ekkis> jedimind: that's the request
[10:58:30] <ch3mical> :)
[10:58:36] <ekkis> the question is stated in the posting
[10:59:11] <joe2231> ryanneufeld: I'm trying to generate a list of links to the ids of those divs, and then make them into a jquery-ui tabs
[11:00:10] <ekkis> ch3mical: you're using a value and trying to execute it
[11:00:43] <GoGoGarrett> http://jsfiddle.net/zwudX/1/   this will get it to popup in a dialog box with the code :D
[11:00:44] <ekkis> the parameter "callback" in lin 2 gets whatever .val() returns, which isn't going to be executable
[11:00:55] <GoGoGarrett> But it doesn't execute the code
[11:01:00] <ryanneufeld> you need eval
[11:01:03] <ryanneufeld> which is evil
[11:01:14] <ch3mical> That was just meant for the example.. the point is I'm passing a function like mystuff.thisthing(function() { blah });
[11:01:15] <GoGoGarrett> code injection ftl
[11:01:21] <ryanneufeld> eval($(thing).val())
[11:01:41] <ch3mical> ew
[11:01:50] <ryanneufeld> joe2231: are you trying to dynamically create the tabs ?
[11:01:54] <ch3mical> Look, the textarea was just an example
[11:02:00] <joe2231> yes
[11:02:06] <ch3mical> That's not how I'm actually getting the function
[11:02:09] <ekkis> what .val() returns can't just be called
[11:02:21] <ch3mical> The function is passed from another function in my actual code
[11:02:50] <ryanneufeld> joe2231: you don't need to with jquery tabs
[11:03:27] <ch3mical> Here http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zwudX/2/
[11:03:36] <ch3mical> If that helps to illustrate it better
[11:04:40] <joe2231> ryanneufeld: I was under the impression that you needed an unordered list in order to have the library take over and create the tabs
[11:04:49] <ryanneufeld> yeah, sorry, i was mistaken
[11:04:50] <ryanneufeld> you do
[11:04:53] <ch3mical> Also the reason it's being saved to a variable is because in my actual code the callback is called later by a different function, but it gets stored by the "thisthing" function first
[11:04:54] <ch3mical> lol
[11:05:15] <ch3mical> If I could show you the actual code it would make sense why I'm doing it that way :)
[11:05:32] <ekkis> ch3mical: I would do this.thatthing()
[11:05:48] <ekkis> to fire the callback
[11:05:58] <ch3mical> Tried that
[11:06:20] <ch3mical> :/
[11:06:28] <Drule> Hi
[11:06:35] <GoGoGarrett> I believe you're just overriding the method thisthing by assigning it later on
[11:06:44] <GoGoGarrett> so it's not injecting it back into your old codd
[11:07:24] <ekkis> ch3mical: you do realise that your code won't run as it is, right?
[11:07:29] <ekkis> it won't compile
[11:07:49] <ch3mical> I wrote that example very quickly.. did I typo?
[11:08:26] <ekkis> ch3mical: I've updated it: http://jsfiddle.net/zwudX/3/
[11:08:31] <ch3mical> Oh I see
[11:08:36] <ekkis> which works fine
[11:08:37] <ch3mical> Forgot );
[11:08:40] <ekkis> yes
[11:08:56] <ryanneufeld> anyone else having JS fiddle open a new tab when you click run?
[11:10:26] <ch3mical> http://jsfiddle.net/therealklanni/zwudX/4/ so when I move it to another function, like I have it in my code, why doesn't that work?
[11:10:37] <ch3mical> wait, another typo
[11:10:47] <ch3mical> Oh it did work
[11:10:53] <ch3mical> Ugh wtf
[11:11:16] <ch3mical> ok I guess it's not the concept I have wrong...
[11:11:31] <ch3mical> Time to step through my code :D yay.
[11:16:27] <ch3mical> haha ok it was a text-case issue
[11:17:00] <ch3mical> One of the if statements was checking a response that has uppercases, that's why it wouldn't fire :P
[11:18:15] <ThrushAAX> hehe, classic
[11:18:56] * ekkis laughs
[11:18:58] <David_Bradbury> Anyone have experience with the Nivo Slider? It works great, but when doing the 'fade' effect the image position goes weird
[11:19:03] <David_Bradbury> all the other effects seem fine
[11:22:44] <ch3mical> Sheesh, maybe now I can get some sleep
[11:32:13] <Ely2> http://jsfiddle.net/7P2aM/4/  - When I click the url and load the xml the first time it gets appended to #List. When I click the link again it gets appened again on the #List
[11:32:26] <Ely2> but i have my xml loaded twice
[11:32:41] <Ely2> it gets appeneded every time beneath the already appended ones
[11:32:51] <Ely2> how can I solve this to only show each GET once ?
[11:35:05] <Zopieux> hi
[11:35:11] <Zopieux> i've a general question
[11:35:33] <erichynds> Ely2: unbind the event after it fires
[11:35:51] <Zopieux> is it faster/more efficient to load ajax content by sending html code directly, or sending JSON data and create the elements manually?
[11:36:07] <Ely2> $("#List").html(List); insted of append worked as well erichynds
[11:36:10] <Ely2> or is this not a good way?
[11:36:29] <joe2231> I'm trying to dynamically create tabs on a couple of pages, and I've been using jquery to modify the dom to be pretty much identical to the tabs example, but then when I call .tabs(), I get the correct classes added, but the tabs don't appear in the in interface, any ideas? relevant fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/p8pxU/5/
[11:36:50] <erichynds> that'll work Ely2. you might be unnecessarily requesting data over and over again, but i dunno ur requirements
[11:37:09] <Ely2> ok
[11:37:11] <Ely2> i'll check it
[11:37:13] <Ely2> thx
[11:38:14] <ekkis> Zopieux: my guess? send html because if you send json you first have to encode and then decode whereas the html just lands in place
[11:39:04] <ekkis> json's more compact but I don't think that'll save you much and it complicates matters if you have heavily marked up HTML
[11:39:20] <Zopieux> ekkis, server-side I don't work with html
[11:39:40] <Zopieux> i work with my language data structures (lists, dictionnaries, etc.)
[11:39:42] <ekkis> sure, but there are systems like MVC3 that generate it for you
[11:39:54] <Zopieux> json is the easiest way of serializing data
[11:39:58] <Zopieux> in my case
[11:40:06] <Zopieux> generating html is a bit more dirty
[11:40:12] <ekkis> if it's just data then it probably doesn't matter
[11:40:20] <ekkis> since you're having to encode it anyway
[11:40:25] <Zopieux> sure
[11:41:03] <Zopieux> but my question is really, with jquery, is it better to give html or building the elements manually
[11:41:43] <Zopieux> i guess it's faster with html.
[11:41:54] <systemfault> Depends on the need... for simple things, I just get HTML
[11:42:19] <dalaen> jQuery doesn't handle elements added dynamicly ? I mean I, for example, add HTML to a <div />, and jQuery seems like not to reckognize elements in that added stuff
[11:42:21] <systemfault> For something that looks more like an application, I prefer templates and building the markup from a JSON
[11:43:45] <ekkis> dalaen: it does
[11:44:42] <dalaen> ekkis: for eg, I'm adding with a jquery event a form button, and I'm having a trigger on the new created form button to do something else. That last trigger won't work
[11:45:51] <ekkis> dalaen: show code
[11:46:06] <dalaen> ekkis: http://jsfiddle.net/NanGU/
[11:46:18] <xxiao> i have a button(jqueryUI), when i press that button i want it to execute a series of cgi-bin/scripts that used to be done multiple-steps in old html style
[11:46:19] <dalaen> When you click on "ajouter un article", it adds a line
[11:46:21] <xxiao> how to do that?
[11:46:40] <dalaen> ekkis: when you click on the "+" button, it's supposed to change a <p>
[11:47:04] <xxiao> basically in html i have to manually do multiple steps, now i want to do it at one click under jQuery, the scripts at the server side will stay the same
[11:47:32] <systemfault> dalaen: Events are bound on a "node" basis, the newly added buttons won't have triggers.
[11:48:01] <systemfault> dalaen: You would need something like event delegation to make it works: .live or .delegate
[11:48:32] <ekkis> dalaen: oh... I see.  I wouldn't do it that way.  I would create elements and attach them.  I'm guessing this approach should work but I've never done it that way
[11:49:07] * xxiao is totally new to jquery
[11:49:44] <ekkis> dalaen: systemfault is right, to do it this way you'd have to delegate.  if you do it my way, you don't
[11:50:15] <systemfault> ekkis: Yeah :)
[11:51:11] <ekkis> var button = $('<input />', { type: 'button', id: 'add' }).click(function() { $('p').text('Pwet'); });
[11:51:19] <dalaen> ekkis: systemfault So I should have a look at .live and .delegate in documentation, I'll have it now :)
[11:51:23] <dalaen> Thank you :)
[11:51:27] <ekkis> then button.appendTTo(whatever);
[11:52:25] <ekkis> dalaen: to write html into a string is messy and will lead to other problems.  create elements as I've outlined, then you don't need to "live" things up.  there's a cost to .live()
[11:52:28] <ekkis> I gotta run
[11:52:29] <dalaen> ekkis: I'm taking a good note of that :) I thought I could only do this task in pure JS
[11:52:42] <systemfault> ekkis's solution is "simpler"
[11:52:47] <ekkis> well, why bother with js if you have jquery :)
[11:53:44] <ekkis> dalaen: oh, and don't do shit like "onclick='remove(...)'" but use the jquery mechanisms.  much cleaner
[11:54:12] <dalaen> ekkis: that was the solution for the js, because I tried with js :)
[11:54:31] <dalaen> but I wanted to make sure to understand with jQuery
[11:55:12] <dalaen> Thank you a lot :)
[11:55:40] <ekkis> no worries mate
[12:06:08] <iMpressed> hi! im new to jquery and JS and i have a question: lets say i put a click event on all divs with some class executing an anonymous funciton.. if i insert a new div with that class there the event is not fired/caught. what is the best way to add the event to the newly inserted div?
[12:08:10] <erichynds> iMpressed: delegate() or live()
[12:11:07] <iMpressed> erichynds: thats what i was looking for! thanks very much
[12:15:26] <xxiao> newbie here, how do I link "action" which is a cgi-bin script to a button on jquery's UI
[12:17:00] <xxiao> someone gave me a jquery ui with buttons, i need hook those buttons to old html-used cgi-bin scripts
[12:17:38] <xxiao> any pointer is highly appreciated, thanks!
[12:19:11] <xxiao> looks like jquery form is the way to go...hmm
[12:19:38] <Aristata> how do I get the current domain with jquery
[12:19:56] <Aristata> like htt[://google.com/blahj => htt[://google.com
[12:19:59] <Aristata> minus the typos
[12:20:32] <skamikaze> Aristata: => location object
[12:21:01] <Aristata> huh?
[12:22:19] <skamikaze> Aristata: http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-window-location
[12:27:06] <fljitovak> Hey guys. I'm trying to disable/enable a div based on which radio button is selected. Can anyone help me figure out why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/CkuLR/
[12:28:56] <khaan> hey everybody: this should emulate the press of a button, but apparently it's not working; any hint?   jQuery("#Home > a").trigger('click');
[12:29:59] <icio> khaan: I'm not entirely sure, but that certainly ought to trigger the click event; for user-equivalent of clicking, try .click()
[12:30:37] <khaan> icio: click apparenty should be like of a "call to action". I need to have that button pressed without the user is doing it...
[12:30:41] <Aristata> skamikaze:  Thanks!
[12:30:57] <skamikaze> Aristata: yvw
[12:30:57] <icio> khaan: .click() emulates the click of a button
[12:31:22] <khaan> trying
[12:31:23] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: two things, you can't have your script tag after the body close tag
[12:31:34] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: and the selector shouldn't have a @ in it
[12:31:53] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: http://jsfiddle.net/CkuLR/1/
[12:32:17] <khaan> not working :(
[12:32:34] <icio> Your selector is correct, yes?
[12:32:50] <icio> Otherwise, jsfiddle?
[12:33:15] <fljitovak> Cork[home]: Ahh okay, thank you for the correction.
[12:33:21] <Cork[home]> np
[12:33:41] <khaan> icio: apparently it is, it's a button whose id is Home. Tried also to use #Home > a
[12:33:43] <khaan> but no go
[12:34:25] <fljitovak> Cork[home]: Although, the functionality I am looking for is still not working. Any idea why that is?
[12:34:54] <skamikaze> icio / khaan: trigger('click') === empty click() call
[12:35:43] <icio> skamikaze: yeah that makes sense
[12:35:54] <khaan> skamikaze: my initial code was jQuery("#Home > a").trigger('click'); which was supposedly correct, but it doesn't clicks on the menu voice, apparently
[12:36:09] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: i forgot a debugger; statement in there, its prob what causes it for you
[12:36:56] <skamikaze> khaan: no event bound or empty jquery object
[12:37:14] <khaan> skamikaze: please explain :)
[12:37:56] <skamikaze> khaan: console.log( $("#Home > a"), $("#Home > a").length ) )
[12:38:28] <khaan> trying.
[12:39:42] <khaan> wait, where should i execute that?
[12:39:50] <fljitovak> Cork[home]: I removed the debugger statement. Still nothing. Did it work for you? All it supposed to do is hide the text when you select the middle radio button.
[12:40:03] <skamikaze> khaan: in your javascript console like firebug e.g.
[12:40:14] <khaan> ok
[12:40:22] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: adding the attribute disabled="disabled" to a div won't hide it
[12:40:44] <Cork[home]> fljitovak: you prob want .show and .hide see ?.show and see ?.hide
[12:40:45] <bot-t> fljitovak, .show(): Display the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/show/
[12:40:45] <bot-t> fljitovak, .hide(): Hide the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/hide/
[12:42:41] <fljitovak> Cork[home]: Beautiful. Thank you very much for your assistance :)

[12:48:01] <khaan> skamikaze: it tells me  "syntax error: missing before statement"
[12:48:44] <GoGoGarrett> jslint ftw
[12:56:58] <khaan> skamikaze, you there? :)
[12:57:17] <skamikaze> kind of
[12:57:52] <khaan> :) i tried what  you said and told me "syntax error: missing before statement"
[12:57:53] <skamikaze> as someone already told ya jsfiddle would be nice ;)
[12:58:02] <khaan> jsfiddle?
[12:58:44] <skamikaze> khaan: console.log( $("#Home > a"), $("#Home > a").length )
[12:59:16] <khaan> skamikaze: result is jQuery(a #✉) 1
[13:00:08] <SpecialEmily> is that a small envelope?
[13:00:26] <skamikaze> khaan: run $("#Home > a").click() from firebug and check your event binding
[13:00:30] <khaan> looking like it. Don't ask me what it is, i'm a noob :D
[13:01:01] <khaan> from the console, it's working
[13:01:07] <khaan> trying to fix my script now
[13:01:17] <skamikaze> khaan: http://getfirebug.com/javascript => breakpoints
[13:01:46] <skamikaze> khaan: or jsfiddle.net
[13:02:17] <khaan> skamikaze: i will have to learn this, yup.
[13:02:32] <khaan> anyway the script in the console works: same script in my code doesn't
[13:02:46] <skamikaze> khaan: then show your whole code
[13:02:47] <skamikaze> :>
[13:03:10] <khaan> :)
[13:03:25] <khaan> before boring you more, i will try a different position for the same script. Hold on.
[13:06:02] <khaan> skamikaze: i'm trying to have a menu button pressed. The rest of the script is just about fades and stuff. If you feel like helping me i can show you the site...

[13:07:18] <RobW> $("#s-slider").append($('<ul />')); $("#s-slider ul").html($("#pImgs").find("li." + id));
[13:07:20] <khaan> it uses quicksand
[13:07:41] <khaan> and i need to have the "home" button pressed so the articles disappear before being loaded
[13:07:45] <RobW> because for some reason firebug shows it's working but the dom doesn't display it
[13:07:52] <khaan> (thx, btw)
[13:08:13] <RobW> the html is also dimmed out in firebug.. but i see some elements
[13:09:18] <madhat> what is the best way to take the elements returned by $("script[src]") and make an array of the source attribute's value?
[13:12:15] <skamikaze> khaan: replace jQuery("#Home > a").delay(3000).click(); with window.setTimeout( function () { $("#Home > a").click(); }, 3000 );

[13:15:15] <ohaibbq> o/
[13:15:19] <skamikaze> lol
[13:15:21] <smykes24> he might get my vote if he looks at my code ;)
[13:15:30] * skamikaze hides fast
[13:15:41] <khaan> lol, maybe i should ask him another v-small thing then it's all yours
[13:15:42] <khaan> :D
[13:16:25] <smykes24> if its simple i might be able to help you
[13:16:38] <BuddytheRat> For some reason, all of my code after calls to the custom "manageControls" function is not working: http://pastebin.com/fs6eyiiY
[13:16:56] <khaan> thx smykes: since i'm a n00b this gives the privilege to make anyone feel cool with me :D
[13:16:59] <BuddytheRat> nothing after line 44 runs, and if you comment out line 44, nothing after line 53 will run
[13:17:19] <BuddytheRat> anybody know what the deal is?
[13:17:35] <sk8ball> hey guys anyone familiar with basecamp's todo lists and how you can drag and drop items between lists?  i've been experimenting w/ sortable but i'm not sure its what i'm looking for... any ideas on how to implement this functionality?
[13:17:45] <khaan> i am calling the colorBox script from within the titles with such code: jQuery(document).ready(function (){jQuery("a.colorbox-content-link").live('click', function(){jQuery.colorbox({href:jQuery(this).attr('href'), width:800, height:600});return false;});});
[13:18:05] <khaan> when i start it's cool. As long as i shuffle the elements (same site) i got a mistake
[13:18:37] <David_Bradbury> Does this look wrong to anyone? $("#slider .nivo-controlNav img").animate({left: '-600px'}, 14000, function(){});
[13:19:17] <sk8ball> Can anyone help point me to a reliable drag and drop between unordered lists?
[13:19:34] <smykes24> sk8ball: there is a drag and drop demo in the UI site
[13:19:51] <smykes24> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
[13:20:16] <smykes24> sk8ball: particularly this
[13:20:17] <smykes24> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#shopping-cart
[13:21:57] <smykes24> khaan: is this online?
[13:23:14] <skamikaze> smykes24: your array definition is a mess - no offense
[13:23:21] <sk8ball> smykes, i'll take a look... i was messing around with the sortable plugin
[13:23:25] <smykes24> yeah skamikaze I agree
[13:23:32] <smykes24> it was formatted one per line before
[13:23:35] <sk8ball> it allows drag and drop between lists but it is very, uhm... messy
[13:23:59] <David_Bradbury> My code works just fine - but when I go to reset the 'wheel' after the animation finishes, it hangs - any ideas? http://pastebin.com/8Ak3GSWH
[13:24:00] <sk8ball> and if a list has no <li>'s it doesnt seem it can be dropped into
[13:24:23] <David_Bradbury> Why would you make a list without list items?
[13:24:52] <sk8ball> smykes, and to complicate things these lists are being generated progrmatically
[13:25:31] <sk8ball> david, because it is a "category" per se, and items from other lists will need to be moved into it
[13:25:59] <sk8ball> but even if it is empty it should be accessible
[13:26:22] <khaan> gotta rush away, thanks skamikaze and smykes24  :)
[13:26:28] <David_Bradbury> Maybe just make a list item that says 'empty'?
[13:26:48] <sk8ball> if i have to i guess that would be a possiblity...
[13:27:09] <sk8ball> kinda messy tho
[13:27:10] <smykes24> skamikaze: http://pastebin.com/BFVGjA6G
[13:27:11] <smykes24> better?
[13:27:18] <quuxman> how do I get the relative position of the cursor to the position of the event target?
[13:27:20] <skamikaze> smykes24: just rewrite that and use any loop functionality :)
[13:27:21] <smykes24> sk8ball: whats creating it?  ASP?
[13:27:47] <smykes24> skamikaze: did you look at the index values?
[13:27:58] <smykes24> skamikaze: there are duplicates etc
[13:28:14] <smykes24> skamikaze: its replicating a card game deal
[13:28:42] <quuxman> it's not as simple as "e.pageX - target.offset().left" because offset() changes when you scroll (target is "position : fixed"), and .position() is always a handful of pixels off
[13:30:22] <quuxman> actually .position() is relative to the parent element, and I want relative to the window
[13:33:37] <smykes24> Shoot skamikaze you were helping then my computer spontaneousl shut off
[13:33:43] <smykes24> did you say anything i missed?
[13:33:46] <David_Bradbury> http://pastebin.com/tixJ09qa - Any help? When I get rid of the callback, it works. But as soon as I add it, it breaks
[13:35:14] <quuxman> smykes24: nothnig was said in your brief absence
[13:36:47] <smykes24> hrm
[13:36:50] <skamikaze> smykes24: just splice after injecting the array content
[13:37:00] <smykes24> I am splicing
[13:37:04] <skamikaze> or use the return of splice
[13:37:26] <smykes24> and the last index is returning undefined for some reason
[13:37:52] <skamikaze> you do the following: var a = [0,1,2]; a.splice[2,1]; alert(a[2]) => undefined
[13:38:28] <skamikaze> (as you reduce array length with splice)
[13:39:44] <skamikaze> smykes24: again: rewrite that and use for / while instead of that monster something :p
[13:40:15] <skamikaze> *a.slice(2)
[13:40:39] <smykes24> how do i pick a random number from all of them if i hae spliced the array
[13:40:44] <smykes24> its dealing cards
[13:41:17] <skamikaze> you already pick a random number, just reduce after the concatenating
[13:41:38] <smykes24> but they wont keep the same index values
[13:43:11] <smykes24> im not trying to be difficult, im trying to understand
[13:44:21] <skamikaze> smykes24: http://pastie.org/2057977
[13:45:21] <skamikaze> reduced example: var a = [0,1,2]; a.splice(2); console.log(a[2])
[13:45:26] <skamikaze> => undefined
[13:46:05] <smykes24> yeah i dont get how this eliminates the big long array
[13:47:07] <skamikaze> if you get last array key as index and splice that element off you can't use the index anymore
[13:47:12] <skamikaze> that's all
[13:47:19] * skamikaze is afk
[13:47:21] <skamikaze> bye
[13:47:27] <smykes24> thanks
[13:50:31] <smykes24> aha
[13:50:43] <smykes24> i get what he was saying :-p
[13:56:36] <xxiao> can I use xmlhttp.send() to process multiple xmlhttp.open(GET...)?
[13:56:39] <rietan> I seem to have an issue with the lovely fancybox plugin. Tabbing moves focus back and forth between lightbox elements and elements in the "main" document (the stuff beneath the lightbox). Anyone know a good workaround/fix for such an issue?
[13:56:50] <xxiao> or i have to do them one pair of time?
[13:57:28] <dabear> xxiao: this is #jquery. go to ##javascript for general js qs
[13:58:48] <xxiao> dabear: thanks
[14:00:04] <andywww> hi, if i wanted to use an ajax call to properly build an anchor element and insert it into the dom, would i literally spit out html code in a .text(); call or should you build them up as objects somehow first?
[14:06:45] <andywww> is anyone actually talking or is my client broke?
[14:07:13] <andywww> i find it hard to believe there is silence in a room filled with 809 people...
[14:11:17] <Haprog> alloc: :P
[14:11:20] <Haprog> oops
[14:11:33] <Haprog> oh he left already
[14:11:41] <Haprog> meant andywww
[14:18:04] <David_Bradbury> Hmm, so the first time I run "$("#slider .nivo-controlNav img").animate", it runs just fine - But when I call it again, it only grabs one of the images. A third time, it doesn't grab any - And none of the classes, etc... change
[14:18:07] <David_Bradbury> any ideas?

[14:47:26] <JSM87> Hi guys, I have a string "id1,id2,id3,id4,id5" I want a way to explode them using the comma and then loop through so I can use each id individually
[14:48:20] <ravenzz> JSM87 split
[14:49:39] <JSM87> Would something like this work str.split(',').each(function() {$(this).... })
[14:50:10] <ravenzz> dunno
[14:50:15] <ravenzz> you should try that
[14:51:27] <ryanneufeld> JSM87: that work. .each isn't a native javascript method
[14:52:20] <JSM87> can you give me an example please
[14:52:28] <ryanneufeld> JSM87: what would work is this: $.each(str.split(','),function(){$(this);});
[14:52:37] <JSM87> Cheers let me try it
[14:52:48] <ryanneufeld> ?$.each() @ JSM87
[14:52:50] <bot-t> JSM87, .each() - Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/

[14:54:30] <ravenzz> JSM87 http://jsfiddle.net/KnH47/
[14:54:53] <David_Bradbury> Is easing turned on by default in .animate?
[14:55:35] <JSM87> ravenzz: Your way worked
[14:55:45] <David_Bradbury> Hmm
[14:55:51] <David_Bradbury> Looks like it is, lame
[15:03:11] <ryanneufeld> JSM87: ravenzz's method is the same as the one I suggested
[15:06:19] <Funkytown> What JQuery package do I need to download to create accordion tabs?
[15:09:22] <Krinkle> Funkytown: jQuery core + jQuery UI

[15:13:11] <Techdeck> hey guys, anyone knows of a good way to trigger a touchstart event on a specific x/y location of the screen?
[15:16:30] <MrNibbles> Techdeck: no luck then ;)?
[15:16:59] <Techdeck> no, I tried it before, I'm thinking of using trigger to trigger touchstart and touchend
[15:17:12] <Techdeck> but I have a feeling they put it outside of the HTML, that play button is probably at the browser level
[15:17:15] <Techdeck> in which case I'm screwed
[15:17:37] <MrNibbles> ohhh i see
[15:17:57] <MrNibbles> its considered shadow dom
[15:18:13] <MrNibbles> Techdeck: this might be handy: http://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/
[15:19:22] <MrNibbles> try combining createEvent with those shadow dom refs there
[15:19:27] <MrNibbles> i have no idea if it will work
[15:19:32] <MrNibbles> but its an interesting idea none the less
[15:20:45] <MrNibbles> Techdeck: trigger only works with events that are bound through bind
[15:21:01] <JSM87> Hi I have 4 divs all set to display:none in the css. I then have jquery make them visible again using.show()  although this doesnt work. It only works if I do hide().show()
[15:21:09] <Techdeck> apple are such assholes.
[15:21:12] <JSM87> Any idea how to get it to work without having to also hide again in jquery
[15:22:13] <MrNibbles> Techdeck: its to stop people eating up mobile bandwidth supposedly
[15:22:47] <TuRnc04tZ> sup gents, i have a quick question
[15:22:55] <TuRnc04tZ> is it possible to style an IFrame's scrollbar?
[15:23:03] <ryanneufeld> yes and no
[15:23:06] <ryanneufeld> depends on the browser
[15:23:17] <ryanneufeld> unless you want to implement your own
[15:23:25] <ryanneufeld> I wouldn't rely on being able to
[15:23:30] <TuRnc04tZ> hmm
[15:23:42] <TuRnc04tZ> i've seen a few jquery plugins that claim to do so
[15:23:50] <TuRnc04tZ> but i was wondering if i would be able to do my own
[15:23:54] <TuRnc04tZ> at the same time
[15:24:11] <TuRnc04tZ> it seems like they dont really theme it, but rather do overflow: hidden and then create a div etc to look like a scrollbar
[15:24:16] <ryanneufeld> they aren't likely styling the browser one, but making their own
[15:24:21] <ryanneufeld> which can be done
[15:24:31] <ryanneufeld> exactly
[15:24:32] <MrNibbles> JSM87: do you have 'display: none !important' in your stylesheet?
[15:24:40] <JSM87> MrNibbles: no
[15:25:03] <JSM87> MrNibbles: it is in a $(document).ready(function(){ though
[15:25:06] <JSM87> Would that matter
[15:25:11] <MrNibbles> no
[15:25:28] <MrNibbles> JSM87: jsfiddle.net
[15:26:14] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: its possible in IE and Webkit browsers
[15:26:38] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: http://css-tricks.com/custom-scrollbars-in-webkit/
[15:26:43] <MrNibbles> more shadow dom techniqes
[15:27:07] <MrNibbles> but if you want it cross browser your better off using a plugin such as http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[15:33:12] <TuRnc04tZ> MrNibbles, so it is not possible in gecko browsers?
[15:34:22] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: as far as i know, no
[15:36:35] <TuRnc04tZ> ok, Thanks gentlemen
[15:36:55] <TuRnc04tZ> MrNibbles,
[15:36:55] <TuRnc04tZ> * josefig (~josefig@unaffiliated/josefig) has left #jquery
[15:36:57] <TuRnc04tZ> oops
[15:37:02] <TuRnc04tZ> http://www.hesido.com/web.php?page=customscrollbar**
[15:37:06] <TuRnc04tZ> http://www.hesido.com/web.php?page=customscrollbar ***
[15:37:37] <TuRnc04tZ> seems to be cross browser, thanks tho, you def lead me the right way, no js needed just css
[15:37:38] <TuRnc04tZ> :)
[15:39:20] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: thats a javascript implementation?
[15:39:50] <MrNibbles> if your going for js libs i recommend  jScrollpane
[15:39:50] <MrNibbles> http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/
[15:41:28] <TuRnc04tZ> jScrollpane didnt seem to work with the iframe
[15:41:37] <TuRnc04tZ> it looks like that is all css
[15:41:48] <TuRnc04tZ> i tried all the jquery based ones :(
[15:42:49] <spiky> TuRnc04tZ what are you trying to achieve ?
[15:43:01] <draginx> $(data.battle_log).appendTo('#battle_log'); if data.battle_log = "Ah" and #battle_log.length = 1 why is appendTo not working? =/
[15:43:59] <spiky> are you sure you can append a simple text ?
[15:44:15] <draginx> I don't see why I wouldn't be able to =/
[15:44:17] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: those bars are styled with JS/CSS but they are not native browser elements, its the same approach as jScrollpane
[15:44:43] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: here is the iframe example from jScrollpane
[15:44:43] <MrNibbles> http://jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com/iframe.html
[15:46:42] <spiky> draginx: $(data.battle_log) = $("Ah")
[15:46:58] <draginx> hmm ok
[15:47:04] <spiky> try append
[15:47:07] <spiky> not append to
[15:47:21] <spiky> $('#battle_log').append(data.battle_log)
[15:47:23] <draginx> …data = json though
[15:47:25] <draginx> ok
[15:48:00] <draginx> worked thanks
[15:48:23] <Assimilater> is there someway i can trigger a slider's slide function when manually changing the value?
[15:48:41] <spiky> np
[15:48:47] <Assimilater> i tried doing .slider('option', 'value', value).slide()
[15:48:57] <Assimilater> it appears slide isn't a function except in the constructor
[15:49:59] <spiky> Assimilater you're manually changing the value in a input ?
[15:50:09] <Assimilater> well there are many inputs
[15:50:21] <Assimilater> and i want to adjust the slider accordingly with changes made by the others
[15:50:56] <spiky> .slider( "value" , [value] )
[15:51:04] <Assimilater> yes that changes the value
[15:51:09] <Assimilater> but it doesn't execute the slide function
[15:51:12] <Assimilater> that i made in the constructor
[15:51:17] <spiky> oh
[15:53:15] <TuRnc04tZ> thanks MrNibbles
[15:53:23] <spiky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#hotelrooms
[15:54:03] <MrNibbles> TuRnc04tZ: welcome, hope you get it working
[15:55:03] <Assimilater> that updates the value
[15:55:12] <Assimilater> it doesn't trigger the slide event
[15:56:52] <spiky> well because there is no slide event it happens instantly, i guess you would have to call it
[15:57:01] <fris> does github give you space to put demos up?
[15:59:18] <Assimilater> right
[15:59:21] <Assimilater> so how do i call it?
[15:59:25] <Assimilater> .slide didn't work
[15:59:46] <spiky> Assimilater do another function outside that does what the function from the constructor does ?
[15:59:56] <Assimilater> i suppose i can get around it
[16:00:11] <Assimilater> i was hoping to just use what was already there
[16:00:25] <spiky> Assimilater maybe there is a way
[16:00:28] <spiky> to call that function
[16:00:41] <spiky> but i guess is easier just to make another one
[16:00:54] <Assimilater> ok
[16:03:38] <xsamurai> i asked this yesterday but didnt have time to test it out, trying to set a variable in colorbox pop up and pass it to the parent page but so far no luck http://jsfiddle.net/GLE5C/
[16:04:35] <xxiao> can I mix the 'standard' javascript ajax call with jquery's ajax? somehow it did not work
[16:05:01] <xxiao> i mean, i was using javascript's ajax and it did not work well
[16:05:20] <xxiao> do i have to use jquery's ajax in jquery UI?
[16:12:14] <Assimilater> jquery's ajax is nice, but i see no reason why you couldn't use regular ajax
[16:12:19] <Assimilater> what do you mean "did not work"/
[16:14:49] <xsamurai> oddly enough i cannot reference variables in the iframe with parent. syntax as well
[16:15:03] <spiky> :)
[16:15:09] <spiky> that's only for child windows
[16:15:52] <xsamurai> ok how would one set variables in a colorbox pop to the parent
[16:17:03] <Tallisman> morning everyone :P
[16:17:13] <xsamurai> morning just who i was missing
[16:17:14] <Assimilater> 'morning
[16:19:19] <Assimilater> hey talli, you don't happen to know if you can trigger a slider's slide "event" with code, do you?
[16:19:25] <xsamurai> Tallisman: I tried the onclosed method for colorbox i mentioned yesterday and it did not work
[16:19:25] <Assimilater> (you may remember my little left and right buttons)
[16:20:02] <Tallisman> Ah, should be possible Assimilater :P, no reason it should not be.. maybe an event to the slider element?
[16:20:12] <Assimilater> so i thought
[16:20:17] <Assimilater> i tried tagging .slide on the end
[16:20:21] <Assimilater> apparently not a valid function
[16:20:44] <Assimilater> for reference (may look a tad familiar): http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/Admin.php?action=ViewReports
[16:21:32] <Tallisman> No, I don't think it should work that way, you actually try to bind another slide to already existent slide.., xsamurai, do you have a jsfiddle?
[16:22:07] <Assimilater> he posted this a second ago: http://jsfiddle.net/GLE5C/
[16:22:14] <Tallisman> ah :)
[16:22:18] <xxiao> Assimilater: I put ajax to a function and then use the img.click() to call it,
[16:22:43] <xxiao> Assimilater: it never gets executed, plus the img button disappeared before i can have anything to click on
[16:22:46] <xsamurai> Tallisman: http://jsfiddle.net/GLE5C/
[16:22:57] <Tallisman> hahaha, that does look familiar xsamurai :P
[16:23:02] <xxiao> Assimilater: if i put a simple alert() into the img.click() it works fine
[16:23:02] <xsamurai> =P
[16:23:16] <Assimilater> xxiao: sounds ok to me...you have a fiddle?
[16:23:19] <xsamurai> im setting final_val in the popup
[16:23:27] <xxiao> you mean code?
[16:23:29] <xxiao> i can paste it
[16:23:42] <Assimilater> i assume you mean into something like jsfiddle.net
[16:23:53] <xxiao> not really
[16:24:00] <MrNibbles> One of my pet peeves is when people link non-functioning jsFiddle links
[16:24:06] <Assimilater> direct copy paste in here will result in muting iirc
[16:24:09] <MrNibbles> its not pastebin ya know :P
[16:24:21] <xxiao> i use pastebin
[16:24:26] <MrNibbles> you shouldnt
[16:24:34] <xxiao> why...
[16:24:53] <Assimilater> well pastebin just allows you to paste code
[16:24:54] <MrNibbles> xxiao: there are far better alternatives!
[16:25:01] <xxiao> MrNibbles: i'm all ears
[16:25:03] <Assimilater> jsfiddle gives you context of html and optionally css
[16:25:10] <Assimilater> so you can see how the code actually works
[16:25:30] * xxiao 's daily job is linux device driver hacking...fairly new to js world
[16:25:41] <xxiao> Assimilater: thanks. trying
[16:26:28] <MrNibbles> xxiao: if you want similar to pastebin, i suggest github gist or pastie
[16:26:51] <MrNibbles> otherwise use jsFiddle if your creating a working example
[16:26:55] <MrNibbles> which is much, much better
[16:27:20] <coldhead> you're*
[16:27:56] <Assimilater> ?
[16:28:33] <MrNibbles> coldhead: yes.... :P
[16:28:55] <xxiao> MrNibbles: thanks
[16:28:59] <xxiao> http://www.pastie.org/2058529
[16:29:13] <Assimilater> coldhead: my bad, haha
[16:29:24] <Assimilater> put ? too early
[16:29:42] <xxiao> can anyone educate me why alert("something") work but state-off-modxlet() does not?
[16:29:53] <xxiao> it's less than 15 lines of code
[16:30:06] <sic1> ?  i am creating a fetch method that will return an ajax dfd...unless it has found something in localStorage...so if i find something in localStorage, but still want to keep the dfd chain going, can i just return $.Deferred().promise().resolve()? Or is there a better way?
[16:30:12] <bot-t> sic1, rmurphey - Filed under 'javascript' - http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/?tag=javascript
[16:30:49] <sic1> why is that bot0t telling me i suck at javasacript
[16:31:04] <sic1> lol
[16:31:05] <MrNibbles> xxiao: use the jQuery $.get() method
[16:31:13] <coldhead> because in his eyes most people do
[16:31:14] <MrNibbles> and put your code to execute in a callback
[16:31:19] <psilo2> xxiao: I don't believe I've ever seen - in a js identifier name, I think that's not valid.
[16:31:37] <coldhead> also you started with a ?
[16:31:37] <psilo2> xxiao: js follows the same naming rules as C, or very very close to the same at least.
[16:31:45] <Assimilater> nvm
[16:31:48] <Assimilater> lol
[16:31:54] <coldhead> yes, - is invalid in a symbol because it looks like subtraction
[16:31:57] <xxiao> psilo2: can you be more specific?
[16:32:02] <MrNibbles> psilo2: yep!
[16:32:05] <coldhead> some-thing == some - thing
[16:32:06] <sic1> bot-t is rough...does he have an answer for me then if he thinks he is all knowing??
[16:32:21] <psilo2> xxiao: numbers, letter, underscores, can't start with a number, etc.  You know C, right?  same rules
[16:32:24] <coldhead> bot-t: do you have an answer for sic1?
[16:32:25] <bot-t> coldhead, Most likely.
[16:32:27] <Assimilater> coldhead: are you asking or telling? :P
[16:32:33] <coldhead> bot-t: will you share it?
[16:32:33] <bot-t> coldhead, As I see it, yes.
[16:32:38] <xxiao> those code are from Vietnam, i'm supposed to hook a GET to activate something
[16:32:40] <coldhead> bot-t: please elaborate?
[16:32:41] <bot-t> coldhead, Without a doubt.
[16:32:41] <xxiao> sigh
[16:32:51] <Assimilater> bot-t: please?
[16:32:52] <bot-t> Assimilater, It is certain.
[16:32:54] <Assimilater> haha
[16:32:58] <sic1> lmao
[16:33:18] <coldhead> useless bot
[16:33:27] <xxiao> psilo2: are you saying the 8908s as the msg?
[16:33:31] <coldhead> your question is too hard for me sorry sic1
[16:33:37] <coldhead> it soudns interesting though
[16:33:40] <xxiao> and the - in between strings?
[16:33:40] <sic1> hmmm
[16:33:47] <sic1> well thank you for lookin for me
[16:33:52] <sic1> and for asking bot-t!
[16:34:00] <sic1> im pretty sure im good with what i got goin
[16:34:07] <sic1> im usually just looking for a better way :)
[16:34:11] <Tallisman> xsamurai -> http://jsfiddle.net/GLE5C/1/
[16:34:24] <Tallisman> It looks like crap.. Euhm, Lol
[16:34:44] <coldhead> sic1: the sharpest jQueers for deferreds are on their ways home from TXJS
[16:35:01] <coldhead> if you want to work with what you got and ask in about 14 hours?
[16:35:04] <sic1> haha
[16:35:15] <psilo2> I've still only glanced at the new deferred stuff, I'm so busy and lazy, bad combo
[16:35:22] <Tallisman> jQueers O.o?
[16:35:55] <sic1> i saw THE dude talkin bout it at jqCon a bit back
[16:35:59] <psilo2> a term of endearment
[16:36:12] <sic1> i just didnt have this question for him then :) and i wish i had been able to go to txjs....looked like fun
[16:36:18] <Tallisman> Oh, so it means, if you do jquery you are a Jqueer? :P
[16:36:30] <coldhead> jaubourg?
[16:36:34] <sic1> there ya go
[16:36:36] <coldhead> he's on the channel often enough
[16:36:38] <Assimilater> so what if you peruse jquery?
[16:36:42] <sic1> i didnt wanna butcher it
[16:36:43] <Assimilater> a poser?
[16:36:45] <psilo2> man, I am in Austin, wish I had known about txjs.
[16:36:50] <psilo2> I totally should have gone
[16:37:00] <GoGoGarrett> It was sold out for awhile I believe
[16:37:04] <Tallisman> hahahaha xD, suppose so Assimilater :P
[16:37:12] <Assimilater> drat
[16:37:14] <Assimilater> haha
[16:37:29] <Assimilater> i still haven't figured out if there's a function call that will execute the slide function
[16:37:56] <Assimilater> it seems that at least for the moment i'm reduced to adding an extra function call to my code in three places :S
[16:38:15] <Tallisman> you simply want to reposition the slide at a specified point right?
[16:38:20] <Assimilater> nay
[16:38:27] <Assimilater> i want to execute the slide function as well
[16:38:50] <Tallisman> do you have a jsfiddle =]?
[16:38:55] <Assimilater> i have a live link
[16:38:57] <psilo2> They're having a js party afterwards too, without us! Lame
[16:39:04] <Assimilater> http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/Admin.php?action=ViewReports
[16:39:12] <Assimilater> feeling a bit too lazy to copy it to a jsfiddle :P
[16:39:58] <Assimilater> there is my old fiddle still out there....
[16:40:01] <Tallisman> I see, and what does it need to do :P?
[16:40:18] <Assimilater> well the left and right arrows need to actually trigger the slide event
[16:40:29] <Assimilater> as indicated right now by them just exectuing the contents of the slide function
[16:40:43] <Assimilater> also when the search returns a result the buttons will trigger a change in the slider
[16:40:49] <Assimilater> likewise will the datepicker
[16:40:56] <Assimilater> so it's either add that function call in three places
[16:41:03] <Assimilater> or just trigger the event as i'm changing it somehow
[16:41:18] <Assimilater> (here's my old fiddle if you prefer to fiddle) : http://callserver.dyndns.biz:89/Admin.php?action=ViewReports
[16:41:19] <Assimilater> oops
[16:41:23] <Assimilater> http://jsfiddle.net/BtSPa/8/
[16:41:24] <Assimilater> there
[16:41:50] <psilo2> engaging hax mode
[16:43:47] <Tallisman> okey, so it needs to trigger the getReport function?
[16:43:53] <Assimilater> in essence
[16:44:06] <Assimilater> quite frankly it's functional as is
[16:44:13] <Assimilater> minus the idea of holding down the buttons
[16:44:16] <Assimilater> haven't gotten to that yet
[16:44:28] <Tallisman> just boolean work :P
[16:45:27] <Assimilater> i was just "hoping" for being able to do it without calling the function myself
[16:47:44] <Tallisman> It might be me..
[16:47:46] <Tallisman> but ehem
[16:47:56] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/BtSPa/9/
[16:48:07] <Tallisman> Isn't that what you want o.O?
[16:48:28] <Tallisman> (clicking right button is a b*tch because of jsfiddle lol
[16:48:37] <Assimilater> lol
[16:48:45] <Assimilater> ya it is
[16:48:49] <Assimilater> it's just an extra function call
[16:49:37] <Tallisman> aaaah
[16:50:01] <spiky> Tallisman http://jsfiddle.net/VJEV4/
[16:51:01] <thomedy449> i need help please im trying to use my first callback function on animate and im not sure how to do it
[16:51:17] <thomedy449> i was reading the jquery.com page...but it only took me so far
[16:51:35] <spiky> callback is the 3d argument on the animate function
[16:51:39] <thomedy449> i want to animate it and after all is done replace the div with another div
[16:51:42] <spiky> from my memory
[16:51:56] <thomedy449> yeah i think i read that on the jquery.com
[16:52:14] <thomedy449> but as a call back im hoping i can use
[16:52:54] <thomedy449> but as a call back im hoping i can use
[16:53:44] <thomedy449> {step: function() {$(this).css('background','url(tuff.png)'}};
[16:53:49] <thomedy449> am i close
[16:54:08] <spiky> you want to use this as a callback ?
[16:54:19] <thomedy449> well im not sure how to do it other than that
[16:54:31] <thomedy449> i wnt the image to change after the animation
[16:54:41] <thomedy449> i just no realized i could put a delay on it
[16:54:58] <thomedy449> but whatever method i am trying to animate and then swap images
[16:55:16] <Tallisman> my internet failed.
[16:55:16] <spiky> .animate( properties, [ duration ], [ easing ], [ complete ] )
[16:55:24] <thomedy449> right i saw that i
[16:55:28] <thomedy449> and thank you
[16:55:33] <spiky> Tallisman http://jsfiddle.net/VJEV4/
[16:56:03] <spiky> thomedy449 instead of [complete] just place function() {do whatvere}
[16:56:45] <sic1> if anyone wants the answer to my question i asked just a bit ago... return $.Deferred().resolve(); dont need promise in there...
[16:57:34] <coldhead> thanks sic1
[16:57:45] <coldhead> that looks neat
[16:58:14] <sic1> i cant wait to show this one off...nooot ready yet....
[16:58:43] <coldhead> where are you going to drop it? githb?
[16:58:49] <coldhead> or you got a blog?
[17:00:30] <sic1> it will be on github...my 'blog' needs work
[17:01:15] <sic1> its an MVC structure based around an up and coming platform...
[17:01:25] <sic1> well, i dont know what to call it
[17:01:26] <sic1> but
[17:02:17] <sic1> it will be here once the time comes...nothing there yet https://github.com/ckihneman
[17:02:51] <sic1> im out yall, cheers!
[17:06:07] <thomedy449> im sorry i was a bit distracted in response to your comment spiky that anonymous function be a jquery.css function
[17:07:17] <xsamurai> Tallisman: Thank you for the example i was away from the computer
[17:07:46] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/BtSPa/13/ <-- Assimulator :P
[17:07:52] <Tallisman> np xsamurai :P
[17:08:45] <Tallisman> Assimulator, might not be it, but I thought you wanted to avoid unnessesary function calls.. this kinda does that :P
[17:09:00] <kataire> What is the easiest way to replace an element's tagName? (I want to convert all div to p)
[17:09:39] <Tallisman> kataire:
[17:09:43] <Tallisman> ?replaceWith
[17:09:44] <bot-t> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[17:09:57] <kataire> Tallisman: That removes the children, though, doesn't it?
[17:11:35] <Tallisman> scroll down :P
[17:11:40] <Tallisman> the last example is what you need
[17:13:34] <kataire`> Tallisman: That removes the children, though, doesn't it?
[17:14:14] <kataire`> I guess I could do $divs.wrapInner('<p/>').replaceWith($divs.children()) ... I wonder if that works
[17:15:57] <kataire`> It works. Yay.
[17:16:17] <Tallisman> :p
[17:16:40] <xxiao> it took me one full day to know nothing jquery, little on html/javascript, to get things working with ajax, yeah!
[17:17:05] <xxiao> the water is deep, but it's a good start,
[17:17:29] <xxiao> time to mow the lawn
[17:17:40] <thomedy449> im so tired i keep falling asleep
[17:17:42] <thomedy449> okay
[17:17:44] <thomedy449> bakc to it
[17:17:47] <Tallisman> :P
[17:17:49] <thomedy449> i got stuff dto do
[17:18:20] <Tallisman> i'm eating potato chips
[17:19:33] <thomedy449> i have a 2 year old so i go to bed late learning this stuff so i can start getting paid and then he gets mu up unwelcomely early
[17:19:42] <johtso> Do jQuery plugins have to be loaded after jQuery itself or does it not matter?
[17:20:16] <Tallisman> they need to be loaded after
[17:20:35] <johtso> Tallisman: thanks
[17:22:32] <thomedy449> http://jsfiddle.net/44r7Y/2/
[17:22:36] <thomedy449> okay i just need help
[17:22:39] <thomedy449> am i even close
[17:22:47] <Tallisman> give me a moment :)
[17:23:30] <thomedy449> it might be a bit messy ihave ben jsfiddling for a bit now
[17:23:34] <thomedy449> so sorry for that
[17:23:49] <thomedy449> i try to keep my code clean
[17:25:06] <thomedy449> ive gotten much better for sure but im still learning
[17:28:33] <spiky> hey thomedy449 here's your solution http://jsfiddle.net/vgAGm/
[17:30:20] <GoGoGarrett> Some coco dev should design an app that cache's your last 5 copies, or I should find a script for vim that when you DD it doesn't mess up you YY!
[17:30:39] <spiky> you got undo
[17:30:43] <spiky> press u
[17:31:05] <GoGoGarrett> Yeah, I know, but it still when you dd it put's that in your clipboard
[17:31:14] <GoGoGarrett> which is lame and what not
[17:31:15] <spiky> oh
[17:31:24] <spiky> yea i know i had that problem too
[17:31:30] <spiky> but it's just vim's clipboard
[17:31:35] <spiky> you can just ctrl+insert
[17:31:42] <spiky> to copy to windows clipboard
[17:31:47] <Tallisman> spiky, your solution doesn't work ^^
[17:31:48] <thomedy449> okay spiky i really appreciate it and thank you but your css doesn't turn to green like mine
[17:31:59] <Tallisman> the reason is pretty simple
[17:32:05] <thomedy449> again i do appreciate it though
[17:32:08] <Tallisman> backgroundColor instead of background
[17:32:36] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/vgAGm/2/
[17:32:49] <spiky> oh sorry mate http://jsfiddle.net/vgAGm/4/
[17:33:01] <spiky> i just didn't realized the callback was not woring fine
[17:33:05] <spiky> working*
[17:33:23] <Tallisman> If you want to change it with animate.. you will need include a plugin in order to make it work
[17:33:30] <thomedy449> thank you you said mate where are you from
[17:33:39] <Tallisman> this is because the animate function *does not* support color transitions
[17:34:02] <spiky> you're on jquery channel we are mates :))
[17:34:40] <thomedy449> my color function in my actual page works for css but your saying on animate it wont?
[17:34:46] <thomedy449> im running a css
[17:35:10] <thomedy449> jquery on click just to see if i could do it its when i add it as a callback i srew myself
[17:35:17] <thomedy449> andill check that updat out
[17:36:32] <thomedy449> that feels close to what im doing
[17:36:41] <thomedy449> okay thank you super than you let me try
[17:37:11] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/vgAGm/5/
[17:38:03] <Tallisman> note the resource I added in order to make that code to work ;P (http://view.jquery.com/trunk/plugins/color/jquery.color.js)
[17:38:21] <Tallisman> without it, it isn't possible :P
[17:38:41] <Tallisman> (unless you make something yourself hahahaha)
[17:38:43] <thomedy449> hmmm.... thnak you
[17:38:51] <thomedy449> okay so it wasn't necessarily me
[17:39:07] <thomedy449> cuz i tried so many things and by itself my css worked
[17:39:19] <Tallisman> no :P, backgroundColor just doesn't exist in animate();
[17:39:54] <thomedy449> oh i read taht i thought it meant just no shortcts cuz jquery .com was saying sometimes you can short cut the property and then after that it made that comment i
[17:39:57] <thomedy449> mis interpreted it
[17:46:26] <vazel> hey has anyone ever managed to work with drag & drop and a slider?
[17:47:15] <_beau> not yet :(
[17:48:27] <thomedy449> it worked thank you
[17:48:44] <thomedy449> do i need a plugin for background-image
[17:48:49] <thomedy449> cuz that is the overall goal
[17:48:54] <thomedy449> and again thank you color works now
[17:57:09] <Tallisman> http://jsfiddle.net/vgAGm/6/ <-- only on moments you do things like that you realize how empty your life really is xD
[17:57:38] <Tallisman> the bug in it.. I blame jsfiddle 6.6
[17:58:28] <Tallisman> vazel, you still there?
[17:59:27] <vazel> yeah
[17:59:37] <Tallisman> already found the answer to your question?
[17:59:45] <vazel> no still tinkering
[17:59:53] <vazel> you ever mess with the 2 together?
[17:59:54] <Tallisman> ah, what is the problem ^^?
[18:00:09] <vazel> so i have 30 elements in a slider that i drag and drop on a 'board'
[18:00:24] <Tallisman> do you have an example :P?
[18:00:36] <vazel> NDA :|
[18:01:01] <vazel> i can try making an unbranded version though
[18:01:18] <Tallisman> oh, with jsfiddle you can make a simple example of your problem (jsfiddle.net)
[18:02:02] <Tallisman> that way it won't jeopardize your NDA :)
[18:05:06] <vazel> give me a moment
[18:13:20] <_rob_> doesn jquery ui not work with 1.6.1?
[18:14:31] <Tallisman> _rob_ it does
[18:14:49] <_rob_> hmm apparently i have another problem
[18:31:34] <SkyFlyer> how can i put one div's content into another div.  I don't want to replace it, just want to copy the content and put it into another div?
[18:31:37] <_rob_> it looks like the plugin I upgraded no longer uses jquery ui so I guess i need to downgrade or write some more code
[18:31:51] <GoGoGarrett> .clone()
[18:31:52] <_rob_> .append()
[18:33:25] <SkyFlyer> cool thanks!
[18:38:11] <johtso> Would making this change make any difference to this code? (Removing explicit passing of window and document to the anonymous function) http://pastie.org/2058897
[18:38:18] <chuck> does this code look okay? specifically line 15 https://gist.github.com/1022208
[18:38:24] <chuck> it's erroring for me, I'll grab the exact message
[18:38:40] <johtso> I would have thought the function has access to things in the global namespace making it unnecessary, am I missing something?
[18:38:46] <chuck> TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating '$(document.createElement("div")).attr("id", "promo_" + promo.id).text(promo.title).appendTo($(this))')
[18:43:15] <_rob_> johtso, no, it should work exactly the same
[18:43:50] <johtso> _rob_: hmm, wonder why it was put there then..
[18:44:33] <_rob_> i see a lot of js devs do that with global objects but I don't know why
[18:45:24] <_rob_> chuck, $(document.createElement("div"))
[18:45:28] <_rob_> why are you doing that?
[18:45:39] <_rob_> $('<div />')
[18:46:34] <chuck> _rob_, i was having issues with "<div />" earlier, but same error
[18:47:39] <_rob_> chuck, then your chaining is probably breaking somewhere. break it out into individual lines instead of chaining it and see which one isn't returning a jquery object
[18:47:39] <Tallisman> is it possible to prevent the screen from going white on pagereload?
[18:47:51] <Tallisman> like a buffer while reloading?
[18:48:18] <_rob_> Tallisman, are you creating your page layout with mostly javascript?
[18:48:34] <Tallisman> php, javascript, html :P
[18:49:02] <Tallisman> but I find it anoying that when a page reloads, sometimes, not always, the page flashes
[18:49:04] <_rob_> but it most of your styling done with javascript is what i meant
[18:49:11] <Tallisman> no :P
[18:49:33] <Kichael> I'm using .autocomplete, how do I make it so that after something is selected from the menu of autocomplete, the <input> is refreshed and so is another div where that data is now displayed?
[18:50:10] <normelton> i've got an event callback that sets "this" correctly. but if i call another function inside the callback, $(this) becomes null. how do i preserve the $(this) binding for my "inner" function?
[18:50:18] <_rob_> Tallisman, i've seen flashing on pages before usually caused by bad coding but I don't know if that's the case with what you're doing
[18:50:54] <Tallisman> myeah, could be bad coding, the screen needs to be parsed before being displayed :P
[18:50:57] <_rob_> var that = $(this);
[18:51:06] <_rob_> before your anonymous function
[18:51:10] <_rob_> then use that
[18:51:37] <_rob_> Tallisman, yes that would cause the problem
[18:51:39] <Tallisman> you could also pass it as parameter
[18:51:42] <normelton> _rob_: but this isn't an anonymous function... do i need to pass "this" as an argument?
[18:52:17] <_rob_> normelton, i would have to see some code but probably yes
[18:53:05] <normelton> _rob_: got it, thanks
[18:54:46] <Tallisman> meh, a recode is comming up.. some bugs are really bastards XD. Currently have a page that looks slightly random every reload :P, changes in width of elements, without any reason.
[19:00:27] <Tallisman> So.. Can you prevent page flashing at all? :P
[19:01:11] <Tallisman> thus, when you hit f5 a thousand times in a single second.. that no white background occours?
[19:01:29] <_rob_> sure
[19:01:45] <_rob_> buffer the event handler
[19:01:50] <johtso> How do you do something like "if (obj.foo > 5){alert 'hurray'}" in a way that wouldn't throw an error if obj doesn't have a property foo?
[19:02:01] <_rob_> dont allow a uers to hit f5 a thousand times a second
[19:02:32] <_rob_> if(typeof obj.foo != undefined)
[19:03:12] <jovrtn> if (obj.foo && obj.foo > 5)
[19:03:23] <jovrtn> not too sure about that one
[19:03:29] <jovrtn> makes sense in my head though
[19:04:08] <johtso> _rob_: Just realised it doesn't throw an error anyway
[19:04:34] <johtso> _rob_: and it returns false if obj.foo is NaN too
[19:04:54] <johtso> So don't need any more check do I?
[19:05:11] <_rob_> probably not but try other browsers
[19:07:17] <frio80> Is there a known issue with jquery clone() method and cloning radio buttons checked attribute?
[19:13:30] <coldhead> there shouldn't be, frio80
[19:13:38] <_rob_> damn it why are there tons of bugs in half the jquery plugins i download
[19:13:42] <coldhead> can you get a demo of the problem up on jsfiddle?
[19:14:06] <coldhead> _rob_: they might not be bugs so much as version conflicts?
[19:14:57] <frio80> coldhead: You're right.  There's a known bug in my HTML!  Fixed.  Thx.
[19:15:07] <_rob_> some of them, true
[19:18:08] <johtso> What are the restrictions on where a script element can be dynamically inserted into a page and be loaded?
[19:19:34] <_rob_> you should be able to put it anywhere
[19:21:34] <abjorn> ?js this
[19:21:35] <bot-t> abjorn: <global object>
[19:22:08] <abjorn> ?js var out=[];for(var name in this) { out.push(name); } out;
[19:22:09] <bot-t> abjorn: ["window", "$", "jQuery", "save", "remember", "remove", "forget", "require", "load", "alert", "console", "revRange", "compose", "flip", "head", "tail"...
[19:27:10] <symaxian> How can I move a li element up/down in a list?
[19:29:15] <coldhead> ?after
[19:29:15] <bot-t> .after(content): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[19:30:09] <coldhead> $('li:eq(2)').after($('li:last')) // or selectors to that effect
[19:31:04] <symaxian> k
[19:36:24] <coldhead> symaxian: http://jsfiddle.net/hcQDD/1/
[19:36:27] <coldhead> worksforme
[19:36:54] <abjorn> coldhead, mah nigga
[19:37:03] <symaxian> yeah I got it, thanks
[19:37:20] <coldhead> thanks FOR NOTHING you mean
[19:37:25] <coldhead> hi abjorn
[19:37:36] <coldhead> you old racist
[19:37:40] <abjorn> lol
[19:37:47] <abjorn> UUUGGGH I HAVE TO GET UP SO EAARRLLYY
[19:37:55] <abjorn> start training at hostgator tomorrow
[19:37:55] <GoGoGarrett> don't do it
[19:38:11] <abjorn> from 8-5 ;-;
[19:38:19] <abjorn> for the next two weeks
[19:38:47] <coldhead> that is for a good cause
[19:38:56] <coldhead> i hope your fellow trainees are decent people
[19:39:22] <abjorn> lol yeah
[19:39:32] <abjorn> there should be quite a few...hostgator is hiring a lot
[19:40:27] <coldhead> the training must be good, i've always had good quick support from them
[19:40:44] <coldhead> probably a good internal database of solutions to lean on
[19:45:41] <GoGoGarrett> How often is regular javascript required within a typical project. I can see sometimes, needing to floor/ceil or perhaps access the actual dom element, but other then that, can't most of it be achieved with jquery?
[19:51:15] <lacrymology> I downloaded a copy of jquery-ui and the sample doesn't work if I move the css and js folders to /media/ and fix the html instead of using relative paths, why can this be?
[19:53:38] <frio80> What is the jquery selector to grab this element from my page? <input type="radio" name="data[Tag_model][newtag][Status][]" value="active" />
[19:56:17] <lacrymology> frio80: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-ends-with-selector/
[19:57:11] <lacrymology> frio80: maybe the "ending with" is not what you're looking for, but the idea is there. $('input[name=<yourpattern]')
[19:58:02] <frio80> lacrymology: Yup.  I got it.  Works perfectly.  Thx!
[20:12:26] <lacrymology> I need help, my cms uses one jquery version, and I need to use a different (newer) one in one of my pages, and I'm getting a coflict there.. is there anything I can do to have two different jquery viersions working?
[20:13:25] <GoGoGarrett> .noConflict perhaps
[20:14:05] <lacrymology> GoGoGarrett: I'm looking into that, but how do I know which version of jQuery's noConflict's being called?
[20:14:11] <_rob_> would probably be better to not use 2 different versions
[20:14:33] <lacrymology> _rob_: I'm checking how can I go about that, but if I don't get to choose..
[20:15:02] <_rob_> you do get to choose
[20:15:17] <_rob_> it's just javascript
[20:16:03] <GoGoGarrett> Well my store I recently set up, ran it's shopping platform on it's on version of jquery, and I had no access to the files it was using
[20:16:10] <GoGoGarrett> So when I ran my files, i just did $.noConflict();
[20:16:10] <GoGoGarrett> (function($){
[20:16:11] <GoGoGarrett>     $(function() {
[20:16:19] <GoGoGarrett> and it worked, but who knows
[20:16:57] <lacrymology> GoGoGarrett: I'll try, then. I guess if I call it right after the include, it should work
[20:16:57] <GoGoGarrett> no conflict, plus i wrapped in jquery instance, i'm not sure if both were needed, but it works.. so :P
[20:18:46] <lacrymology> didn't work, but doing $j = $.noConflict() did
[20:19:04] <GoGoGarrett> good deal
[20:30:46] <graphikz> hey, why doesn't this work the same on safari as firefox? http://www.supercityguide.com/ - when you hti enter it should go to the first result
[20:36:52] <cos_> hello friends
[20:36:59] <Tallisman> Hmmz, I've been trying to be a little hackery lately, being as aschronimous as I possibly can be.. but I have a problem xD
[20:37:30] <cos_> i'm new with jquery and wonder if it's neccessary to have script reference in child pages (parent loads child html via ajax) and why?
[20:37:43] <Tallisman> http://codepaste.net/jtdkhi <-- as if it is a miracle.. this form does not send.. I quess I fail to see what I do wrong :P
[20:37:56] <GoGoGarrett> hahah
[20:38:45] <Tallisman> cos_, you have to load the script on every page in order for it to work
[20:39:11] <cos_> tallisman: ok :)
[20:40:00] <cos_> my anchor scrolling still doesn't work (only works if i load the child page directly into my browser)
[20:40:03] <Tallisman> in order for it to work on every page*, this is because every page load is actually a reload :P, and reloads require you to reload your resources as well.
[20:40:29] <cos_> tallisman: good, i get it
[20:40:31] <Tallisman> anchor scrolling?
[20:40:39] <Tallisman> ah, I seee
[20:41:25] <GoGoGarrett> Love the way you worded your problem Tallis, but I don't see why it shouldn't be working either, but I may be blind
[20:42:09] <Tallisman> I must say.. the entire code is 3000 lines long xD, It might be because I did not end a tag or something O.o
[20:42:24] <Tallisman> my indentation is mostly flawless though xD
[20:42:28] <GoGoGarrett> Good news is.. my code isn't 3000 lines long.
[20:42:29] <GoGoGarrett> :/
[20:42:48] <Tallisman> (hehehe, rapid development is rapid xD)
[20:43:36] <GoGoGarrett> haha :p
[20:44:08] <Tallisman> oh well.. I have to send page information, to store in a session after the page reloads, and also change the url..
[20:44:33] <Tallisman> so currently I'm trying an <input> and <a> combined inside a form :P
[20:44:39] <sk8ball> whats the best tabs plugin?
[20:45:01] <Tallisman> 'the best' is something that does not exist
[20:45:22] <sk8ball> the "most popular/best implemented"
[20:45:35] <sk8ball> i realize those may defer from time to time
[20:45:39] <Tallisman> ah, give me a moment :)
[20:46:14] <Tallisman> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[20:46:21] <Tallisman> that should fill your needs :)
[20:47:17] <Tallisman> GoGoGarrett, do you have a portfolio :]?
[20:47:37] <GoGoGarrett> Not a good one, haha :p  I'm working on building a site of all my works though
[20:47:55] <GoGoGarrett> I want gogogarrett.com but some other scrub has it >:[
[20:49:08] <GoGoGarrett> I can link you a few of my scrub'ish projects though hah
[20:49:21] <Tallisman> that would be nice :)
[20:49:24] <lrvick> ok so i have two functions on this page that are almost identical. playVideo and viewItem found in tawlk.js: http://alpha.tawlk.com/#bitcoin if you click a video, it opens a dialog... if you click a picture it just... breaks
[20:49:32] <lrvick> why doe sone function work and the other not?
[20:50:31] <lacrymology> thanks, al
[20:50:52] <Tallisman> If I click a picture another tab in my browser opens @lrvick
[20:51:18] <lrvick> Tallisman: right. Which means the function is not running
[20:51:24] <lrvick> Tallisman: ther eis an onclick attached to that
[20:51:26] <lrvick> viewItem
[20:51:28] <lrvick> no workie
[20:51:31] <lrvick> :-(
[20:52:04] <lrvick> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier is what i get
[20:54:20] <Tallisman> okey

[21:02:48] <USvER> Can someone help me with ajax chaining? I want to make ajax call based on result from previous ajax call... i know it's new pipe() functionality but i don't know how to use it
[21:03:24] <lrvick> Tallisman: any ieas?
[21:03:47] <Tallisman> yea.. seems like you don't end every line with ;?
[21:04:15] <Tallisman> hyve.stop() for instance.. it could be the source viewer though
[21:04:54] <lrvick> Tallisman: but specifically why would playvideo work and viewItem not?
[21:05:03] <lrvick> those two functions are the specific issue
[21:05:04] <Tallisman> @cos_, look to location.hash
[21:05:10] <Tallisman> ye
[21:05:40] <cos_> tallisman: ok :)
[21:07:05] <Tallisman> javascript:viewItem(' + data + ');
[21:07:10] <Tallisman> seems like the problem is there?
[21:07:26] <Tallisman> javascript:viewItem(\'' + data + '\');?
[21:08:10] <cos_> tallisman: well, i do not quite understand why it works with 'body' despite with '.module'
[21:08:30] <Tallisman> $(".module"). <-- class="module"
[21:09:13] <cos_> tallisman: yes, that's right
[21:09:16] <lrvick> Tallisman: but then it will be treated as a string, right?
[21:09:50] <Tallisman> hmm.. I don't know lrvick.. I don't know why u use onClick in the first place :P
[21:10:03] <lrvick> Tallisman: becasue im creating the element son the fly
[21:10:21] <lrvick> so it seemd to amke sense, rather than give them selectors and then adding click actions to them one by one
[21:10:33] <lrvick> by my logic, anyway
[21:10:45] <Tallisman> hmm, not to me actually :P, addItem();
[21:10:51] <Tallisman> bindEvent()
[21:10:56] <Tallisman> perfectly logical :P
[21:11:02] <lrvick> ive not used that
[21:11:08] <Tallisman> they are not functions
[21:11:09] <lrvick> so i cna do bindEvent on an item i jsut create
[21:11:12] <Tallisman> they do sound nice xD
[21:11:17] <cos_> tallisman: i have a class "module" in my html document. the structure is  html / body / module
[21:11:38] <Tallisman> anyhow, $("the element you just created").click(function);
[21:11:56] <Tallisman> where function is the function you want to call :P
[21:12:38] <Tallisman> the data object automatically get passed along.
[21:12:44] <Tallisman> okey
[21:12:57] <Tallisman> cos_ so you have <div class="module"></div>?
[21:13:45] <lrvick> hmm
[21:13:51] <lrvick> ill have to rework some things
[21:14:00] <lrvick> but thanks, looks like that might be a better option
[21:14:06] <lrvick> and might let jquery give me more helpful error messages
[21:14:16] <Tallisman> then why.. do you look for class="modul"? <-- this is your problem cos_ ;P
[21:14:41] <Tallisman> :P, I agree lrvick :P, I don't trust on error messages myself
[21:15:44] <coderDJ412> Good evening
[21:15:52] <Tallisman> morning :P
[21:17:02] <keyo> afternoon
[21:17:13] <Tallisman> :]
[21:17:40] <cos_> tallisman: yes, i do
[21:18:43] <Tallisman> cos_, if you have an element called class="module", you have to use the appropriate selector, in this case $(".module"), in your example, you use $(".modul")
[21:19:16] <cos_> tallisman: believe me, the class selector is proper
[21:19:43] <cos_> <div class="modul"></div>  $('.modul').animate....
[21:20:00] <Tallisman> ok:P
[21:20:05] <cos_> :)
[21:20:58] <tbranyen> pifantastic: :(
[21:23:17] <Tallisman> have you tryed fixed values cos_?
[21:23:20] <bobbobbins> hey guys, my code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/Ftx2X/ i have two quick quesetions...1) I want to use my setttings var in the methods at the bottom, can someone tell me how to do that(you can see me trying to use it in variation1), and next...in variation1 im setting some html and adding a graph to my page...am i doing this correct, or is there a better way?
[21:23:31] <sodapop> is there any way that i can style a <select> just like it happens with buttons
[21:23:42] <sodapop> without plugins
[21:27:06] <Funhouse> Hi guys, just wondering why twitter and facebook put  #! in their url http://twitter.com/#!/
[21:28:19] <keyo> Funhouse: Maybe it helps with caching or something. Pretty ugly tho
[21:28:26] <Tallisman> # to display the location is different from the start position, ! to display that #! is empty :P
[21:28:44] <Myra> They use it to change the HTML output, I think.
[21:28:50] <Funhouse> ah great thank you Tallisman
[21:31:15] <sodapop> is it possible to use themeroller icons if i include the css from here http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/redmond/jquery-ui.css
[21:31:42] <rpflo> Funhouse: http://code.google.com/web/ajaxcrawling/docs/getting-started.html
[21:33:21] <rpflo> Funhouse: Short story.  You provide crawlable content that google knows is dynamically generated, and google presents the hashbang URL in search results instead of the crawlable version you provided.
[21:34:22] <Funhouse> ahhh very nice nice rpflo thank you
[21:45:30] <USvER> is pipe() and then() synonims?
[21:47:24] <USvER> pipe(), then() and done() too?
[21:47:39] <Phelms215> ?pipe
[21:47:40] <bot-t> Phelms215, deferred.pipe() - Utility method to filter and/or chain Deferreds. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.pipe/
[21:47:43] <Phelms215> ?then
[21:47:44] <bot-t> Phelms215, deferred.then() - Add handlers to be called when the Deferred object is resolved or rejected. http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[21:49:10] <USvER> i know that.... but all that functions do the same?
[21:50:45] <Phelms215> yeah pretty much
[21:51:35] <USvER> $.get('http://google.com').pipe(processResults); is the same as $.get('http://google.com').then(processResults);
[21:52:03] <USvER> and done() looks like too....
[21:52:44] <Phelms215> yeah?
[21:52:45] <cos_> tallisman: are you there my friend?
[21:52:59] <USvER> i asking )
[21:53:04] <Phelms215> im pretty sure pipe is being phased out soon
[21:53:11] <Phelms215> moving towards then
[21:53:17] <Phelms215> or other way around I forget
[21:53:18] <Phelms215> :(
[21:55:15] <USvER> So... i want to ask... Can i chain as much Then() as i want as long as function will return defered?
[21:55:49] <Phelms215> yup
[21:55:52] <Phelms215> should be able to
[21:56:04] <cos_> http://www.cosmonautica.de/dev_/fragenundantworten.html
[21:56:07] <Phelms215> you can chain pipes also
[21:56:30] <USvER> So pipe() is not then()?
[21:56:45] <cos_> i'm having the problem that the "nach oben" link scrolls up too far
[21:56:48] <USvER> I mean i can't understand differances =\
[22:00:10] <USvER> is there a pro that can explain differece between pipe() and then()?
[22:00:35] <marvel> is there anyone here that has worked with jwplayer? im trying to figure out something
[22:01:36] <divno> How does if-statement work on bind click? if($("#element-id").click(function () { $("div.three").show() }); .. ?
[22:02:00] <Phelms215> @USvER .. there really isnt a difference
[22:02:09] <Phelms215> pipe was older but then then came out
[22:02:23] <Phelms215> @ divno what do you mean ?
[22:02:40] <USvER> in documantation said then was in 1.5 and pipe came ou in 1.6
[22:04:31] <Phelms215> I might have mixed them up then
[22:04:36] <USvER> so there was some nead in pipe() function....
[22:04:37] <Phelms215> I always use pipe personally
[22:05:18] <USvER> so pipe().pipe().pipe() works good right?
[22:05:37] <Phelms215> does for me
[22:05:41] <divno> Phelms215 I'm trying to show the element div with class three once an element with id element-id is clicked on. But then I want to go a lil farther and see if div.three is already showing, I want to hide it.. exmple (after element-id is clicked) -> if($(div.three).show()) { $(this).hide() });
[22:05:45] <divno> Is that correct?
[22:06:00] <USvER> Thank you... for clarification
[22:06:38] <USvER> divno use togle()
[22:06:43] <Phelms215> $(element).is(":visible")
[22:06:52] <Phelms215> or toggle
[22:06:54] <divno> USvER That's easy way out.
[22:07:07] <Hilton> Is there a quick way to copy each id attribute of a set of elements into the name attribute?
[22:07:19] <Inure> BNC's available, PM me if interested
[22:07:43] <Hilton> I thought maybe $('.things').attr('name', $(this).attr('id'));
[22:07:46] <Hilton> But that didn't work.
[22:08:28] <divno> Phelms215 And is there anyway of showing one content at the time, rather than showing all ? If I click on another element whatever is shown should be hidden and show just the current element that was clicked on?
[22:09:12] <USvER> Hilton ... each() function shuld help
[22:09:33] <Hilton> I looked at that, but the description for some reason made it sound like it wouldn't. :P
[22:12:04] <USvER> Hilton ... somethin like this $('.things').each(function(){$(this).attr('name', $(this).attr('id'));});
[22:12:53] <rpflo> Hilton: `$(this).attr('id')` is actually running a function and evaluating to a jQuery object (the thing returned from $)  USvER's sample right there should work.
[22:13:38] <rpflo> Though you should probably cache `var el = $(this); el.attr('id', el.attr('name'))` for performance.
[22:13:54] <Hilton> Yep, that seems to be working. :) Thank you!
[22:14:22] <USvER> rpflo i dont think chaching is realy help
[22:14:51] <USvER> in some languages it even bad
[22:15:06] <rpflo> USvER: Then you would be completely mistaken.  $ is a function, every time you use it, a function is called.  If I call it once and you call it twice, you're slower, always :)
[22:15:42] <USvER> hm.... ye you right
[22:15:47] <divno> And is there anyway of showing one content at the time, rather than showing all ? If I click on another element whatever is shown should be hidden and show just the current element that was clicked on?
[22:16:07] <rpflo> not caching jQuery wrapped elements is the #1 mistake of jQuery users, and it's very expensive if your selectors are crazy.
[22:16:09] <USvER> divno be more specific
[22:16:36] <USvER> ye you definately right
[22:18:15] <divno> Well, let's say I have three div and all three are display:none by default. If I click on something, one div (out of the three) shows.. if I click something else, the first div that is visible will hide itself and another div (based on which one I clicked) will show.. if you know what I mean
[22:18:32] <divno> One hides, one shows. I don't want more than one to show.
[22:18:51] <USvER> ye i know
[22:20:15] <USvER> i understand you
[22:20:21] <USvER> but can't figureout
[22:20:36] <USvER> it's simple...
[22:20:39] <Hilton> divno: What is being clicked?
[22:20:59] <Tallisman> divno - $($(this).attr("href")).show().siblings().hide();
[22:21:21] <Tallisman> that should get you started, I suppose, at least in the case the clicked item is a link, which is 90% the case
[22:21:57] <Tallisman> if it is not you should get it with another selector, in any case, afk again :)
[22:22:21] <Hilton> $(function($){ /* <-- start onload function */ $('#button').click(function(){ $('#divToHide').hide(); $('#divToShow').show(); }); }
[22:22:34] <Hilton> set an onclick function to whatever is being clicked to hide and show the respective divs
[22:23:25] <USvER> Tallisman give a good tip
[22:23:33] <Hilton> Ooo .siblings()...didn't know that one
[22:23:34] <USvER> abaout siblings )
[22:23:46] <USvER> :D
[22:37:12] <divno> I'm sorry, couldn't explain any better. Tallisman is on the right path, but isn't siblings limited to (un)ordered list items and select options?
[22:40:44] <divno> Both tips ( Tallisman & Hilton ) are great, I already did your method Hilton but I thought if there is a better way of doing it
[22:41:12] <Hilton> Well, there is.
[22:41:21] <Hilton> That was the quick and dirty method to put you on the right track. :)
[22:41:56] <divno> Doesn't Tallisman's method especially with siblings() only used when (un)ordered list item and/or select option is used?
[22:42:09] <Hilton> Appears to...let me test it.
[22:42:19] <sodapop> if professional templates look bad in i.e. if you look closer :/ waste of time
[22:42:26] <sodapop> if = even
[22:43:22] <sodapop> specially the fonts
[22:43:48] <divno> Hilton Thanks
[22:48:09] <Hilton> well
[22:48:41] <divno> "Well" doesn't sound good! :P
[22:49:28] <Hilton> http://jsfiddle.net/RfY2e/1/ will show that .siblings() works on A and P elements...
[22:49:56] <Hilton> So I guess it works on more than lists. :)
[22:59:39] <cos_> i'm ajax-loading content into a div. firebug shows that my scripts fail on the html to load
[22:59:51] <cos_> why?
[23:17:43] <USvER> Is there any chance that in this example $.Deferred().resolve('1').then(processData).then(processData2); processData2() will be executed first?
[23:21:54] <USvER> All sleeping? =)
[23:24:22] <Tallisman> meh
[23:24:31] <Tallisman> just plain tired :P
[23:25:16] <USvER> So?
[23:25:17] <Lampoon> So are you
[23:25:58] <USvER> I'm 24h awake
[23:26:15] <Tallisman> 52h over here :|
[23:26:21] <USvER> O_O
[23:26:35] <USvER> Dude stop drink coffee
[23:26:45] <Tallisman> energy ^^
[23:26:53] <USvER> Reb Bull?
[23:27:01] <Tallisman> monster :P
[23:27:16] <USvER> Is there any chance that in this example $.Deferred().resolve('1').then(processData).then(processData2); processData2() will be executed first?
[23:27:50] <Tallisman> I don't think so
[23:27:59] <USvER> Me too
[23:28:10] <USvER> but can't get this out of my mind
[23:28:40] <USvER> all the time think that in some situation it will fail all my logic =\
[23:29:32] <Tallisman> then you re-adjust it
[23:29:48] <Tallisman> I currently have no logic at all :)
[23:30:24] <USvER> i have full code full of async ajax chained all around the globe xD
[23:30:37] <Tallisman> xD
[23:31:17] <USvER> if some of chaines swap i'm in trouble
[23:31:32] <Tallisman> would be funny if today, someone, looked at your code and said "you can do all of this in 1 command"..
[23:32:13] <USvER> somethin like that...
[23:32:39] <Tallisman> it actually happened to me once :P
[23:33:06] <Tallisman> the moment that I found out about the $(this). lol
[23:33:48] <USvER> i wuld be happy if i culd do it all by sync...
[23:40:24] <pif> hi, how can I select a 'tr' only with 'td' children (not 'th')?
[23:43:21] <USvER> $('tr td')  ?
[23:44:50] <USvER> or you mean exactly TR...that in innerHTML does'nt contain TH?
[23:51:22] <USvER> hm.... pif
[23:51:28] <USvER> are you here?
[23:52:18] <blackspotwiggins> pif, $("tr").has("td") should work
[23:53:25] <pif> yes, thanks
[23:53:40] <USvER> that helped?
[23:53:54] <pif> blackspotwiggins did
[23:55:00] <USvER> $('tr:has(td)') will work too i think
[23:55:10] <pif> just for fun, how do I select 'tr' except the first one?
[23:55:32] <blackspotwiggins> :not(:first)
[23:55:39] <pif> great
[23:55:41] <blackspotwiggins> not sure if that will work
[23:56:22] <blackspotwiggins> you can use regular array methods on jquery collections
[23:56:40] <blackspotwiggins> so you could shift() the first one out
[23:56:48] <pif> ok
