[13:22:43] <Needhelp> Hi People
[13:22:53] <Needhelp> i need help with one code in jquery
[13:24:30] <ExtraSteve> Don't ask to ask - just ask
[13:24:55] <Needhelp> First sorry for my english
[13:25:06] <Needhelp> what i wanna do is hide some element on one page
[13:25:20] <Needhelp> but only when this url will be loaded first time
[13:25:27] <Needhelp> so i founded a cookie jquery plugin
[13:25:32] <Needhelp> and im using this
[13:25:33] <Needhelp> code
[13:25:34] <Needhelp> jQuery(document).ready(function( $ ){  var myurl = "https://siteurl.it/page/";  var currenturl = window.location  if(myurl != currenturl) {   if( $.cookie( 'products6' ) != 'YES' ) {           $(".product-meta").hide();        $(".featured-image").hide();        $(".product-short-description").hide();        $("#subup1").hide();
[13:25:35] <Needhelp> $.cookie('products6', 'YES');     };}   });
[13:25:43] <Needhelp> but, work ok
[13:25:54] <ExtraSteve> put your code in https://jsfiddle.net/
[13:25:57] <Needhelp> the only problem are that when i go to another browser
[13:26:19] <Needhelp> https://jsfiddle.net/9kLp1e5t/
[13:26:36] <Needhelp> if i load new page the code not work
[13:26:46] <Needhelp> i really dont understend wjy
[13:26:48] <Needhelp> why
[13:28:46] <ExtraSteve> What's the cookie plugin you're using?
[13:30:15] <Needhelp> https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie#readme
[13:31:51] <ExtraSteve> Well first
[13:31:54] <ExtraSteve> window.location is an object
[13:31:59] <ExtraSteve> It's not a string
[13:32:10] <ExtraSteve> So your comparison fails: if(myurl != currenturl) {
[13:32:37] <ExtraSteve> https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/javascript-window-location.php
[13:32:53] <ExtraSteve> You probably want: window.location.pathname
[13:33:22] <ExtraSteve> BEcause your protocol and host may change (http vs https, www.mysite.com vs mysite.com)
[13:34:16] <ExtraSteve> So maybe myurl should just be "/page.html" instead of "https://mysite.com/page.html"
[13:34:23] <ExtraSteve> And then you can use window.location.pathname
[13:44:22] <Needhelp> My protocol not change
[13:44:35] <Needhelp> i maked redirect from http to https and from www to non www
[13:45:14] <Needhelp> can you explain me better how i have to change code?
[13:45:49] <Needhelp> i readed this post too, i dont know if this information are like my problem
[13:45:49] <Needhelp> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30185501/trouble-with-setting-jquery-cookie
[13:49:42] <ExtraSteve> Well, it looks like jquery-cookie is old and not used anymore (may not even work anymore)
[13:49:50] <ExtraSteve> They suggest using js-cookie instead:
[13:49:59] <ExtraSteve> https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie
[13:50:46] <Needhelp> and how i can integrate my code with this one? Im not a developer expert
[13:53:24] <ExtraSteve> Something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/L0mw9b8g/1/
[13:53:26] <ExtraSteve> Oh
[13:59:11] <needhelp> Im again here
[14:03:22] <ExtraSteve> Something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/L0mw9b8g/1/
[14:11:23] <needhelp> WHY YOU PUT if(currenturl == myurl)
[14:11:28] <needhelp> INSTEAD of
[14:11:36] <needhelp> if(myurl != currenturl)
[14:26:51] <needhelp> code not work :(
[14:31:31] <ExtraSteve> Sorry, I reversed the comparison just to see if I could get it to work
[14:31:50] <ExtraSteve> jsfiddle seems to have weird issues setting/reading cookies
[14:31:55] <ExtraSteve> So that's why I did that
[14:36:56] <needhelp> ok, with this code
[14:36:57] <needhelp> https://jsfiddle.net/d8smubg7/
[14:37:06] <needhelp> the action work only first time
[14:37:18] <needhelp> but if i load new page
[14:37:28] <needhelp> not work
[14:41:15] <ExtraSteve> needhelp: you should console.log(currenturl) to understand why it's failing the comparison
[18:07:39] <kittonian> hi all. I am trying to get mmenu to respond differently based on a media query. Basically all I need it to do is become static, allow anything to happen on the page, and not be able to be closed, if the screen size is more than 899px. I am trying to use the offCanvas: false for this but I cannot get the script to work. I put my script in a codepen at https://codepen.io/kittonian/pen/poJqwaY
[18:11:49] <codeguru> Is mmenu a library? If so you need to actually load it
[18:12:30] <kittonian> https://mmenujs.com
[18:13:02] <kittonian> it's all working and i have it perfect for mobile browsers (or any device under 899px
[18:13:24] <kittonian> i'm just trying to make it open at page load and not be able to be closed on screens over 899px
[18:13:55] <kittonian> and i believe the offCanvas core addon is what will allow this to happen
[18:14:20] <kittonian> but i have to do a media query in order to find out the screen size of the device accessing the page. hence the code I posted in codepen
[18:23:37] <kittonian> can you help?
[18:24:10] <kittonian> regardless of mmenu of not, i am just trying to run an if/else on a media query to determine screen size and based on the result enter a line of text
[18:25:21] <codeguru> kittonian: you are missing several stuff here
[18:25:34] <kittonian> i have no doubt i screwed it up
[18:25:39] <kittonian> that's why I'm asking for help :)
[18:25:41] <codeguru> in the codepen, you need to remove the <script> tags
[18:25:48] <codeguru> the JS is implicitely in the <script>
[18:26:05] <kittonian> i'll do that next time
[18:26:07] <codeguru> You also need to include the CSS and JS cdn
[18:26:23] <kittonian> i don't need any of that right now
[18:26:37] <kittonian> i am simply asking how i make this script work
[18:26:51] <kittonian> or rather, why it's not working
[18:26:57] <kittonian> because i'm not getting any errors
[18:27:21] <codeguru> I am
[18:27:43] <kittonian> that's not possible because you're not actually running the script
[18:27:56] <kittonian> can you please just help me with my question
[18:28:20] <kittonian> every single time I ask something, someone asks me to spend tons of time recreating a website in codepen only to look at it and say "i don't know, good luck"
[18:28:36] <kittonian> i really just don't have to time or energy to do it again right now for this simple of a question
[18:28:43] <kittonian> pretend there is no script
[18:28:49] <kittonian> pretend you are writing it from scratch
[18:28:56] <kittonian> that's all i'm asking for
[18:29:40] <kittonian> 1. do a media query for screen sizes with a max-width of 899px
[18:30:01] <kittonian> 2. create an if else where the if says offCanvas: false
[18:30:33] <kittonian> 3. insert that function into another function so that the text offCanvas: false (or offCanvas: true) appears where that function is called
[18:30:35] <kittonian> that's all
[18:33:01] <codeguru> I don't think I understand what you're actually trying to *do*.
[18:36:25] <kittonian> ok, hmmm. how can I explain this any simpler
[18:37:11] <kittonian> in javascript you say window.matchMedia("(max-width: 899px)") in order to do a media query right?
[18:39:01] <kittonian> so, because I need to insert a parameter in the other function of the script, replacing the menuscreenquery(x) {}, line which calls that function with the text of the if statement (i.e. offCanvas: false)
[18:39:16] <kittonian> i had to create a separate function to make that happen
[18:39:31] <kittonian> but like I said, it's not working
[18:39:43] <kittonian> that text is not being replaced based on the size of the user's screen
[18:45:00] <codeguru> First, did you check if MediaQueryList.matches is true?
[18:46:51] <kittonian> did I check? i'm using an ultra wide display and the exact same code from w3schools where the code sees my screen just fine
[18:46:52] <kittonian> https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_matchmedia.asp
[18:47:21] <codeguru> You're not answering - window.matchMedia() returns a MediaQueryList object with the 'matches' property
[18:47:36] <codeguru> And don't ever use w3schools it's horrible
[18:47:51] <codeguru> kittonian: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia
[18:51:22] <kittonian> i have read that
[18:52:06] <codeguru> So what's the issue?
[18:52:17] <codeguru> Does it return true? Or not?
[18:55:11] <codeguru> By the way, the event listener won't do you any good unless the media changes
[18:55:50] <codeguru> You're probably better off with an if statement:  if (window.matchMedia(blah).matches) { blah;} else {blah}
[19:00:59] <kittonian> codeguru, thank you. that works. perfect solution and no other function necessary
