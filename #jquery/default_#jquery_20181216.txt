[00:40:55] <RandomSerb> hello. I've this object: { foo: { bar: 1 } }. How would I add baz: 2 in the same object where bar: 1 is?
[00:41:27] <RandomSerb> I tried $.extend(foo['bar], {baz: 1}), but it doesn't work
[00:41:50] <RandomSerb> I need to use square brackets because keys are dynamic
[01:25:29] <shoky> RandomSerb: obj['foo']['baz'] = 1;
[01:31:55] <RandomSerb> shoky, doesn't work
[01:32:02] <RandomSerb> tried it
[01:32:58] <RandomSerb> not in this use-case, anyway
[01:33:28] <RandomSerb> but fixed it the other way around
[01:54:13] <shoky> next time describe your actual use-case, then
[04:01:47] <devi8> is $.type still valid?
[04:06:03] <Woet> devi8: did you check the documentation?
[04:07:03] <devi8> That's why I am asking
[04:07:11] <Woet> devi8: why?
[04:07:15] <devi8> There is no mention of it being deprecated.
[04:07:22] <Woet> devi8: then doesn't that answer your question?
[04:07:46] <devi8> not necessarily considering it throws an error and jquery documentation is not always up to date. It's good to check with people in the know
[04:07:57] <Woet> then share your jsfiddle test case with it throwing an error
[04:09:48] <devi8> I found another way, but this is where it was throwing an error: https://jsfiddle.net/neverDevi8/bp5dvt07/104/
[04:10:07] <devi8> I tried it on line 36
[04:16:37] <Woet> devi8: 155 lines of HTML, 96 lines of CSS and 127 lines of JS seems a bit excessive for a .type test case.
[04:17:05] <Woet> devi8: and the error is [Error] SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')'
[04:17:05] <Woet> 	(anonymous function) (show:258)
[04:17:49] <Woet> devi8: please share a *minimal* test case showing your issue with $.type. 4-5 lines of JS should be more than enough.
[04:21:03] <devi8> What debug tool were you using to get that error. I get some strange jquery deferred error..
[04:22:26] <Woet> devi8: browser console
[04:22:50] <Woet> devi8: https://s.woet.me/zOZFIU5LA3.png
[04:24:13] <devi8> https://imgur.com/a/WUPEwyl
[04:24:49] <Woet> devi8: there's no jquery-git.js in that jsfiddle.
[04:25:06] <devi8> That's what the console gives me.
[04:25:18] <devi8> Not sure why it says that
[04:25:19] <Woet> devi8: did you click "update" in jsfiddle so you can share the actual code with us?
[04:25:34] <Woet> or "fork" or whatever they have
[04:26:03] <Woet> because the link you're providing does not load jquery-git.js
[04:26:08] <Woet> also, that error has nothing to do with $.type either.
[04:26:33] <devi8> Woet, that's why I was asking. If I had a clear error like you had, I wouldn't have bothered you.
[04:26:44] <Woet> devi8: then give us the actual code that gives that error.
[04:26:46] <devi8> It sounded strange so I thought I would ask.
[04:26:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:26:53] <Woet> devi8: if you'd click your own link, you'd see
[04:26:54] <Woet> bye
[04:31:36] <robertmaxrees> welp
[04:31:54] <Woet> sometimes excessive amounts of incompetence confuse me
[04:32:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:32:10] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[04:32:26] <Woet> like, there's no $.type in the code. theres > 100 lines of CSS/JS/HTML. theres no jquery-git.js
[04:32:27] <Woet> its like they're doing it on purpose
[04:32:37] <robertmaxrees> it's almost like they need more guidance.
[04:32:45] <robertmaxrees> and some extra help.
[04:32:55] <Woet> then they skipped like 100 pages in the programming learning path
[04:33:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:34:26] <robertmaxrees> everything OK?
[04:34:35] <Woet> yup
[04:35:25] <robertmaxrees> weird.  OK.
[04:35:37] <Woet> i can complain about people and still be perfectly fine
[04:35:47] <Woet> you get used to it after many years on IRC
[04:35:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:35:58] <Woet> at least they're not taking my job
[04:36:02] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[04:36:04] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[04:37:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[04:38:51] <Woet> really enjoying this 1 word feedback
[07:04:16] <epinky> why does keyup not work in this? https://pastebin.com/LvdFcq1X
[07:12:29] <Munger> Hi. I'm migrating some code into a plugin and can't get event handlers working. Code is here https://jsbin.com/yogohohuna/edit?html,js,output (sadly the list won't populate because the Ajax call is not written to be cross-domain). Specifically I need to fix the setInterval() handler and clicks on list elements with the class td.details-control and access functions within the Datatable object. My laughable attempts are near the bottom of the plugin.
[07:26:28] <Munger> Actually, I've fixed it to work cross-domain now.
[09:01:47] <Munger> anyone home?
[14:49:41] <notyp> hi
[14:50:12] <notyp> I'm trying to an ajax call to a service that is a subdomain
[14:50:47] <notyp> this causes CORS errors in my browser -- and I have set up the webserver to support CORS calls to the server, but that is not enough it seems
[14:51:01] <notyp> do I need to specify somehow to jquery that this is a CORS request?
[14:51:27] <notyp> so far I only tried a dumb   $.getJSON("
[14:51:29] <notyp> call
[14:51:33] <notyp> maybe this is a mistake
