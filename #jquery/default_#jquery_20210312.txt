[01:30:25] <Robdgreat> I literally require this to be satire
[01:30:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:33:00] <Robdgreat> the last couple lines of chat in here from hours back
[01:33:09] <Robdgreat> more specifically, the last line
[01:33:18] <robertmaxrees> ??
[01:33:34] <Robdgreat> 22:58:04 [ impliednude] proves my point. show off :P
[01:33:45] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue with that??
[01:33:57] <Robdgreat> I hope it was ironic
[01:34:06] <Robdgreat> that's all
[01:34:11] <robertmaxrees> some folks are learning heh.
[09:20:48] <MediumD> Hi, is there a reason why setting data-attr does not work on a virtual dom accessed in selector-context? I've been trying to create some "templating" for a list generated from a json-object: https://jsfiddle.net/3v1L4dpm/19/#&togetherjs=bDdnxkKQjf
[09:22:44] <Cork> MediumD: not sure what you mean, it should work just fine
[09:23:43] <MediumD> Cork, it does for html, but when I try to console.log the set attribute value it is "undefined"
[09:24:16] <Cork> MediumD: though note your not using a nested template and $('', dom) is a shortcut for $(dom).find()
[09:24:24] <Cork> and find only finds children, not filtering in the top level
[09:24:46] <Cork> scoreElement.filter('li').attr('data-value') would work
[09:24:46] <MediumD> seen, that should be it! (btw: how to adress people in irc correctly - I havent found out yet)
[09:25:13] <Cork> MediumD: type the start of the nick and then hit tab
[09:28:47] <MediumD> Cork, thank you that did the trick!
[13:05:08] <robertparkerx> is slideUp part of 1.24 ?
[13:06:01] <robertparkerx> ohI'm misunderstanding the func
[13:06:20] <robertmaxrees> can look at the docs page for a method and it'll tell you which version it was added and if it was removed, which version that happened in.
[13:06:24] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/YNt3HDO.png
[13:07:34] <robertparkerx> nice
[13:07:35] <robertparkerx> ty
[13:08:20] <robertparkerx> can you toggle it?
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> "toggle it"?
[13:08:55] <robertparkerx> can you toggle Up & Down
[13:09:07] <robertmaxrees> so a slide toggle
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> like https://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[13:09:31] <robertparkerx> ah
[13:11:35] <robertparkerx> amazing
[13:11:39] <robertparkerx> ty
[13:11:46] <robertmaxrees> though be careful using toggle methods.
[13:11:54] <robertparkerx> why?
[13:12:02] <robertmaxrees> they can fall "out of sync" easily.
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> s'why i almost never use them.
[13:12:47] <robertparkerx> So for instance I'm just trying to use for a button that is a icon which will bring up text and hide
[13:12:58] <robertparkerx> but wanting the slide
[13:13:10] <robertmaxrees> is there any other element on the page where you're changing text/styles/whatever to correspond?
[13:13:30] <robertparkerx> no
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> then you're probably fine
[13:17:55] <robertparkerx> ty
[17:02:07] <tokam> Hi, I like to post window.location in a variable with jQuery.post but I get the error: Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[17:02:55] <tokam> window.location.toString() helpos :)
[17:20:18] <robertmaxrees> tokam so you fixed it??
[17:20:28] <tokam> yes
[17:20:36] <tokam> toString() is required
[17:20:43] <robertmaxrees> window.location.href can help, as well :)
[17:20:49] <tokam> was a type issue
[17:21:28] <robertmaxrees> yep!  needed a string.  href gets you that, too :)
[17:21:36] <tokam> changed it
