[01:43:31] <Cork> cluelessperson: should work, have you made sure the selector finds the elements?
[01:43:49] <Cork> (also have you tought about using a class?)
[02:04:52] <cluelessperson> Cork: I found I had to do
[02:04:53] <cluelessperson> watched.each(function(){
[02:05:06] <Cork> no you don't
[02:05:09] <cluelessperson> Cork: as it provided a list of elements, rather than an element select like a single selector does
[02:05:16] <cluelessperson> Cork: well, that's what works. :/
[02:05:37] <Cork> cluelessperson: make a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do
[02:07:36] <cluelessperson> Cork: I mean, the lines I provided are basically the thing
[02:07:51] <cluelessperson> var watched = $("#qrcode_input,#qrcode_light_color_input,#qrcode_dark_color_input");
[02:07:58] <Cork> exceopt what you're trying to do isn't included
[02:08:06] <cluelessperson> watched.change(function(){
[02:08:10] <cluelessperson> it never happens
[02:08:23] <Cork> no, that is the wrapper of what you're trying to do
[02:08:43] <Cork> but hey, if you don't what help, that's fine with me
[02:08:53] <cluelessperson> Cork: I have a working solution, and that's the jest of it
[02:09:06] <cluelessperson> I put a console.log("it's working");  there
[02:09:09] <Cork> no, you have a hack workaround
[02:09:17] <cluelessperson> alright, give me a minute
[02:15:48] <cluelessperson> Cork: hm, it's working
[02:16:06] <cluelessperson> Cork: perhaps I thought it wasn't working, because I didn't click outside the element, so never registered as a change
[02:16:24] <cluelessperson> on input event versus change
[02:17:24] <cluelessperson> Cork: See, I want the thing to update as a person changes it
[02:17:37] <cluelessperson> but once the person has typed a lot, updates are too slow
[02:17:58] <cluelessperson> so I need to let it wait 0.25 seconds to 0.5 seconds of no further changes
[02:20:37] <Cork> cluelessperson: you said it was a <select> element?
[02:21:22] <Cork> (i'm still waiting for the fiddle)
[02:27:58] <cluelessperson> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/9ghwvby0/
[02:28:16] <Cork> ok its inputs
[02:28:18] <cluelessperson> Cork: I think it might've worked but I thought a false negative.
[02:28:24] <Cork> cluelessperson: you want the "input" event
[02:28:42] <Cork> cluelessperson: https://jsfiddle.net/6beqv2o1/
[02:29:02] <Cork> cluelessperson: also don't run the selector outside $(function() {})
[02:29:20] <Cork> then it will run before the document has been generated if you run it on a normal page
[02:29:57] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/6beqv2o1/1/
[02:30:00] <cluelessperson> Cork: well it doesn't work hmm
[02:30:11] <cluelessperson> Cork: https://cluelessperson.com/qr/
[02:31:03] <Cork> cluelessperson: make sure .changes_qrcode isn't replaced by qrcode
[02:32:12] <Cork> simplest is to do console.log(watched[0] == $('.changes_qrcode')[0]) before the .on('input', event handler
[02:32:26] <Cork> if it gives you false you have the reason
[02:34:06] <cluelessperson> Cork: well this doesn't seem to work:
[02:34:09] <cluelessperson> watched.on("input", function(){
[02:34:20] <Cork> cluelessperson: did you do the console.log line?
[02:38:00] <cluelessperson> Cork: oh, it was a syntax error
[02:38:02] <cluelessperson> works. :)
[02:38:06] <cluelessperson> sorry for wasting your time
[02:41:14] <Cork> cluelessperson: np
[02:45:32] <cluelessperson> thanks
[06:08:50] <CuirPork> How do I get the css transform:rotate and transform:scale values of an element?
[06:09:46] <CuirPork> var scale=$(".elem").css("transform") doesn't seem right, and .css("transform:scale") looks strange..
[06:11:19] <thykka> with.. *drumroll* yet another jquery plugin!
[06:11:26] <thykka> http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[06:13:34] <CuirPork> so you wrote that?
[06:14:05] <thykka> no
[06:14:14] <thykka> but it seems not-terrible
[06:15:49] <thykka> the root issue here is that when you check an element's transform, the DOM returns it as a transform matrix, not as a list of individual transforms
[06:16:28] <thykka> ..unless you're just looking at the style attribute string
[06:16:29] <CuirPork> so converting the matrix to "familiar" transforms is not easy.
[06:16:46] <undefined_bob> how does the matrix looks like?
[06:16:50] <thykka> you'll lose units at least
[06:17:07] <thykka> translate(8px, 10%) rotate(5deg) ==> matrix(0.996195, 0.0871557, -0.0871557, 0.996195, 8, 4.7)
[06:17:12] <thykka> like that
[06:18:04] <CuirPork> I was just trying to increase the rotation of an element by some amount and $(elem).css("transform:rotate(i*360/total+"deg"); wasn't working
[06:18:15] <thykka> the style attribute string could be more easily parsed, there's most likely some lib for that too
[06:18:32] <undefined_bob> but there is some kind of formula to calculate the matrix back to useable values?
[06:18:32] <thykka> try .css('transform', 'rotate(...)')
[06:19:04] <CuirPork> I tried it a dozen different ways. It was probably a "' error everytime. I'll try it again. thanks.
[06:19:10] <thykka> undefined_bob, yes, as long as you specify the units you want the matrix values to be converted into
[06:19:52] <undefined_bob> nice, thank you
[06:20:25] <thykka> undefined_bob, here's more on the matrix data format https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function
[06:21:54] <undefined_bob> thanks for the link
[06:33:10] <CuirPork> I'm trying to write a blend object in jquery to blend from one transform to another in a number of steps. Any suggestions?
[06:33:30] <thykka> use a lerp function
[06:33:44] <CuirPork> I'll bite:  lerp?
[06:33:49] <thykka> linear interpolation
[06:34:14] <thykka> you give it two points and a percentage, and it calculates a point between those points, at said percentage
[06:35:18] <thykka> (p1, p2, v) => p1*v + p2*(1-v)
[06:35:20] <thykka> ..i think
[06:43:10] <CuirPork> https://codepen.io/Paul2512C/pen/MLRqXV
[06:44:39] <CuirPork> I figure if I could write a blend object that would step between the outer and inner circles, then I could use one key animation and a second transform to apply to the intermediate steps.
[07:09:46] <CuirPork> I would like to be able to add a variable css keyframe animation to an element. $(elem).css("animation","spin "+t+"s infinite"); doesn't cut it. Any ideas?
[07:13:07] <Cork> CuirPork: it should work
[07:16:35] <Cork> CuirPork: though the animation value is wrong
[07:17:11] <CuirPork> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/ywBxgB?editors=0111
[07:17:38] <CuirPork> finally got it to work, sort of. Just experimenting,
[08:54:32] <DeltaHeavy> How active is this channel?
[08:55:04] <thykka> a hundred lines per day, or so?
[08:55:15] <undefined_bob> depends on the day
[08:55:22] <DeltaHeavy> Ah, thanks!
[09:05:20] <Cork> depends on how many question ppl ask i would say :)
[09:11:35] <FilipNortic> and since the standard answer for jQuery qustion in the normal javascript channel is: don't use jQuery. It's nice to have this channel
[09:19:30] <pavonia> Don't use JavaScript!
[09:19:57] <thykka> don't use turing machines!
[09:36:42] <undefined_bob> but I love turing machines :o
[11:23:13] <scOObyDoo> hello?
[11:23:21] <taplar> hola
[11:24:02] <scOObyDoo> how do you send cors when making a request?
[11:24:13] <robertmaxrees> you don't :)
[11:24:20] <taplar> you don't.  the server has to be configured to allow your domain
[11:24:24] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:24:32] <taplar> protocol://domain:port have to be allowed
[11:24:42] <scOObyDoo> ok how do i configure the server to allow cors?
[11:25:04] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[11:25:04] <taplar> that's off topic for the room.  i would suggest looking for a room related to your server
[11:25:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:25:15] <scOObyDoo> taplar: like what?
[11:25:21] <robertmaxrees> lots of material on the internet
[11:25:26] <taplar> what is your server?
[11:25:28] <robertmaxrees> also: we're not a directory service :)
[11:25:39] <scOObyDoo> taplar: i dont have a server. what do you mean?
[11:25:51] <taplar> if you are serving up files on the internet, you have a server
[11:26:08] <scOObyDoo> serving up files?
[11:26:18] <robertmaxrees> scOObyDoo do you run the server you're trying to get data from?
[11:27:03] <taplar> also
[11:27:03] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server
[11:27:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:27:13] <taplar> :|
[11:27:31] <scOObyDoo> taplar: i know what a web server is. i dont have one though
[11:27:44] <scOObyDoo> im only on the front end
[11:27:46] <robertmaxrees> scOObyDoo so do you own the server you're requesting data from?
[11:27:46] <taplar> what website are you trying to hit with the ajax call?
[11:28:05] <scOObyDoo> a external api
[11:28:06] <taplar> does your front  end exist on the internet?
[11:28:11] <scOObyDoo> taplar: ya
[11:28:20] <taplar> then what about that says you do not have a web server?
[11:28:41] <scOObyDoo> yes but i dont have anything to do with it
[11:28:50] <taplar> then you need to talk to who ever does
[11:29:01] <scOObyDoo> who?
[11:29:08] <robertmaxrees> the people that run the server
[11:29:08] <taplar> how would i know?
[11:29:12] <taplar> lol
[11:29:17] <scOObyDoo> i dont even know
[11:29:21] <robertmaxrees> scOObyDoo is the server run by your company?
[11:29:22] <scOObyDoo> im using github pages
[11:29:42] <robertmaxrees> so you don't have any control over the external server?
[11:29:52] <taplar> is github the front end or backend?
[11:29:52] <robertmaxrees> it's a separate party entirely?
[11:30:04] <scOObyDoo> taplar: do you know what github is?
[11:30:08] <taplar> i do
[11:30:15] <taplar> doesn't answer my question though
[11:30:20] <scOObyDoo> have you heard of github pages?
[11:30:23] <taplar> i have
[11:30:25] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks that's gambl0re
[11:30:27] <taplar> and again ...
[11:30:30] <scOObyDoo> its strictly front end
[11:30:33] <taplar> no it's not
[11:30:36] <taplar> ish
[11:30:57] <scOObyDoo> ok
[11:31:03] <taplar> nothing about it being a web server means you can't try to get resources from it with ajax
[11:31:30] <taplar> so the github pages are your frontend?
[11:31:37] <scOObyDoo> yes
[11:31:42] <taplar> and who is the external api?
[11:31:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[11:31:53] <scOObyDoo> i dont know
[11:31:58] <taplar> what is the url?
[11:32:20] <robertmaxrees> and again - scOObyDoo do you or don't you control the api you're trying to hit?
[11:33:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why i'm being ignored.
[11:34:03] <taplar> *shrug*
[11:34:10] <robertmaxrees> this is a perfectly valid, legitimate question - answering it will help us help you.
[11:34:44] <taplar> help us point them to who to talk to at least
[11:34:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[11:34:56] <scOObyDoo> taplar: i dont understnad what you mean
[11:35:09] <taplar> you are trying to make an ajax request to an "external api", yes?
[11:35:13] <scOObyDoo> you mean the url of my website?
[11:35:18] <taplar> no
[11:35:23] <taplar> of the external api url
[11:35:45] <scOObyDoo> the url im trying to get data from?
[11:35:55] <taplar> yes
[11:36:04] <scOObyDoo> seatgeek
[11:36:12] <taplar> what's the url?
[11:36:35] <scOObyDoo> im trying any url
[11:36:39] <scOObyDoo> none is working
[11:36:46] <taplar> we can't find every url
[11:36:51] <robertmaxrees> scOObyDoo have you read any of the resources we've sent you?
[11:36:53] <taplar> we need the real one you are trying to use
[11:37:00] <scOObyDoo> k one sec
[11:37:36] <scOObyDoo> for example, https://api.seatgeek.com/2/events/801255
[11:37:55] <scOObyDoo> how do i configure seatgeek so it uses cors?
[11:38:16] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[11:38:36] <robertmaxrees> they have to allow it
[11:40:48] <shoky> (seems like they do. also jsonp)
[11:41:11] <taplar> http://platform.seatgeek.com/  according to the API page, you're going to need an API key
[11:41:51] <scOObyDoo> so if i get the api key, i can turn on cors after/
[11:41:51] <scOObyDoo> ?
[11:42:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't turn cors on.
[11:42:06] <robertmaxrees> the server does
[11:42:24] <taplar> and if you have a key, the server should most likely (hopefully) not reject the request
[11:42:30] <robertmaxrees> just like we've been saying for the last 20 minutes
[11:43:01] <scOObyDoo> thats what im saying. if i get the key, then the server will turn on the cors on the server? then i can get the data?
[11:43:21] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that cors is disabled on that endpoint?
[11:45:01] <taplar> The assumption being that the api key is needed to use the api from an ajax call, if you give it a valid key, the service should not reject the request.
[11:45:12] <taplar> cors shouldn't be an issue then
[11:45:42] <scOObyDoo> alright cool. i'll give it a try. thanks
[11:45:57] <robertmaxrees> cors is already enabled for that endpoint. by the way.
[11:46:08] <robertmaxrees> shoky++
[11:46:32] <taplar> which one?
[11:46:38] <robertmaxrees> the seatgeek one
[11:46:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wz7L10ut/  is getting a 403
[11:46:55] <robertmaxrees> sure - but cors is enabled.
[11:47:02] <taplar> oh, lol
[11:47:30] <taplar> scooby flipped my logic with his last statement.  yeah, it's on
[11:49:57] <shoky> (╯°□°）╯︵ loƃᴉɔ
[11:50:05] * shoky dies
[11:50:52] <taplar> woah
[11:51:34] <shoky> i apologize for any disturbance
[11:51:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:52:08] <taplar> nah, i'm both impressed, concerned, and interested in the shoky who makes jokes
[11:52:24] <shoky> that's the idea.
[11:52:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:57:02] <sc00bydoo> im still having trouble with cors
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:57:22] <robertmaxrees> you weren't having issues with cors in the first place.
[12:57:50] <sc00bydoo> i turned on cors in the server but im still getting 'Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource '
[12:58:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.  from seatgeek still?
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:59:50] <robertmaxrees> sc00bydoo
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> really don't understand why i'm getting ignored lol.
[13:14:59] <sc00bydoo> if the server has cors turned on, do i have to allows cors on the front end when i make a request?
[13:15:05] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:15:16] <robertmaxrees> the client does not need to make any changes.
[13:15:28] <robertmaxrees> did you read anything that was sent to you on this subject?
[14:13:17] <hightower2> Hey, I have a case that even though my page is loaded via https, the jquery ajax request such as "$.ajax({ url: '/something', type: 'get', async: false, ... })" is being done using plan HTTP. How can I make this use https, but without having to mention hostname explicitly?
[14:14:03] <robertmaxrees> erm/
[14:14:19] <robertmaxrees> it should be using https - is the remote server redirecting to http?
[14:16:36] <hightower2> no, I made sure that http and https both work normally
[14:16:37] <robertmaxrees> also: why the async: false :(
[14:17:21] <hightower2> (i.e. when I manually request that URL over https, I get the expected result, but the browser does http)
[14:17:48] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[14:18:17] <hightower2> 1.11 in this case
[14:18:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah, all my testing shows that relative URLs work correctly.
[14:18:44] <robertmaxrees> dunno what to tell you.
[14:19:03] <hightower2> interesting, OK I'll continue digging, thanks
[14:19:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you using async: false?
[14:19:20] <robertmaxrees> that'll lock the page on the user fwiw.
[14:19:24] <robertmaxrees> really bad experience :)
[14:19:40] <hightower2> (No idea, other people's code. Btw, I did test that if I do specify //host/something as url, then the request does go via https)
[14:19:51] <hightower2> but if it's just /something, it doesn't
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) i just did a bunch of testing and it works fine.
[14:20:09] <robertmaxrees> using just a path
[14:25:39] <setuid> I'm trying to use jquery in a tampermonkey extension to try to identify the default selection in a select group. I'm thinking the "Chosen" plugin is the right approach, but Google isn't helpful with any examples to verify that it's woriiing correctly
[14:26:18] <robertmaxrees> setuid are you just trying to read a select dropdown's value?
[14:26:59] <setuid> robertmaxrees: For now, yes. Ideally, I'd want to pop up an alert() with that entire dropdown populated (I have this working, but the alert() changes the _actual_ select list in the original object, breaking the form, more on that later)
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> erm, you don't need a plugin to read a dropdown.
[14:27:24] <robertmaxrees> just use .val();
[14:27:42] <setuid> one sec, I'll pastebin what I've got
[14:28:40] <setuid> robertmaxrees: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/d0f555e6/
[14:28:43] <setuid> it's super basic
[14:29:05] <setuid> I'm monitoring a page for changes, every 30 seconds, and if the user is logged out, I fire an alert, chang the page tab title and blink it
[14:29:07] <robertmaxrees> wait are you using jqwuery or not?
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> *jquery
[14:29:19] <setuid> robertmaxrees: I'm  not at the moment, but am looking into changing over to it
[14:29:26] <setuid> Because I've hit a wall with basic js
[14:29:27] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> if you just use query, that would be $("#outboundSection div.span8.very-tight div:nth-child(1) label select").val();
[14:29:57] <robertmaxrees> done
[14:29:59] <taplar> "but the alert() changes the _actual_ select list in the original object,"  would be interested in seeing that logic
[14:30:33] <setuid> taplar: I'll pastebin as much as I can and redact the proprietary bits
[14:31:21] <taplar> because depending upon what you are trying to do, pulling in jQuery because you hit a js mental block is...... kinda a smell
[14:31:30] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:31:51] <robertmaxrees> also: there's a "change" event you can hook into.
[14:33:59] <setuid> taplar: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/46a92c64/
[14:34:15] <setuid> No magic, I just set a var, then alert(that_var) and then in the actual page content, the dropdown is 'emptied out'
[14:35:04] <taplar> it looks like all you are doing is alerting and logging outbound_customer
[14:35:06] <setuid> I'm stuck on 2 things I can't figure out: 1.) how to stop multiple alert() dialogs from overlapping (eg, every 30 seconds, a new alert pops up over the preivous, if you don't ack them), and 2.) how to stop the alert() from erasing the selector's option values.
[14:35:13] <setuid> taplar: exactly!
[14:35:16] <taplar> those two actions are not going to change the element at all
[14:36:05] <setuid> but the first time through, I get a popup alert with the dropdown in the alert dialog (which is what I'm trying to do), but then I get a second alert (2nd pass through the timer loop) which is _blank_, I "Ok" both of them, and the dropdown on the page itself, is now unclickable, because its elements are empty.
[14:36:23] <taplar> so something else is changing it
[14:36:43] <setuid> That's the whole code above, with the exception of some console() logging I added and commented out
[14:37:03] <taplar> comment out the alert and log.  the bad behaviour should persist then
[14:37:07] <setuid> Biggest thing right now, is trying to detect the 'selected' value of that selector
[14:37:18] <setuid> Ok, testing that now
[14:37:26] <taplar> the current "selected" value of a select, typically, is just the .value
[14:40:02] <setuid> When I comment out alert/console, the dropdown remains populated. When I uncomment _only_ the alert, it repeatedly (every 'loop' seconds) pops the first element from the select and shortens it, so if there are 10 options in the dropdown, loop_1, now there's 9. I ignore the alert dialog, loop_2, there's 8, loop_3, there's 7, etc.
[14:40:05] <setuid> it's weird
[14:40:41] <setuid> When I ack all of those overlapped alert dialogs, and dropdown the actual selector, there's 3 items left, ack 2 alerts, now there's 1 item left
[14:41:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:41:06] <setuid> Now it's blank, no items at all in the dropdown, and the alert is blank (eg: outbound_customer now has no more values)
[14:41:09] <robertmaxrees> is this a native browser alert?
[14:41:09] <setuid> yeah, it's crazy!
[14:41:12] <robertmaxrees> or is it bootstrap?
[14:41:14] <setuid> just alert()
[14:41:23] <robertmaxrees> what does it look like?
[14:41:23] <taplar> yeah, that doesn't make sense.  unless something in the system has overridden the default behavior of alert/console log, those two things do not modify anything
[14:41:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:42:02] <setuid> it might be bootstrap, it's not a chrome-looking popup, it's styled like the rest of the page
[14:42:12] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:42:12] <setuid> I don't control it, I just call 'alert()'
[14:42:25] <robertmaxrees> so then it has hooks to do those things.
[14:42:41] <setuid> can I force it to use the browser's alert?
[14:43:01] <taplar> that's so wrong....
[14:43:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:43:15] <taplar> :(
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> setuid why use an alert at all?
[14:43:19] <setuid> You've seen the code, I'm not doing anything magical
[14:43:23] <robertmaxrees> why not pop a modal instead?
[14:43:26] <setuid> robertmaxrees: What should I use?
[14:43:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ see my last message :)
[14:44:51] <taplar> well, if bootstrap is overloading his alert(), that would be a modal, no?
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> sure, but he doens't have control over what they did for the button presses.
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> *doesn't
[14:45:21] <taplar> ah
[14:46:12] <setuid> Does a modal cause the focus to switch to that tab?
[14:46:18] <setuid> because I can't have that
[14:46:20] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:46:23] <setuid> Ok, good
[14:46:29] <robertmaxrees> they're just modals
[14:46:50] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you checking every 30 seconds instead of on change?
[14:48:12] <setuid> I tried checking on change, and it didn't work, somthing about not hooking late enough in page load
[14:48:29] <robertmaxrees> probably need a delegated handler.
[14:48:50] <setuid> First things first, modal appears to require some external js libs/code, that's a blocker too
[14:48:56] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> they're already on the page.
[14:49:05] <robertmaxrees> since it's overriding the alert() :)
[14:49:52] <robertmaxrees> try doing console.log($.fn.modal) - what does that print to the console?
[14:49:57] <setuid> https://micromodal.now.sh/
[14:50:07] <robertmaxrees> again
[14:50:12] <robertmaxrees> you do not need a separate modal library
[14:50:29] <robertmaxrees> try what i just suggested.
[14:51:32] <setuid> userscript.html?id=7bd6d2b2-5f1e-46ca-890e-2c3f619004d8:52 ƒ (n,r){return this.each(function(){var i=e(this),s=i.data("bs.modal"),o=e.extend({},t.DEFAULTS,i.data(),typeof n=="object"&&n);s||i.data("bs.modal",s=new t(this,o)),typeof n=="string"?s[n](r):o.show&&…
[14:51:41] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code in the channel
[14:51:42] <setuid> I have no idea what I'm reading there
[14:51:54] <robertmaxrees> and that means bootstrap modals are available on the page.
[14:51:56] <taplar> i see some bs.modal
[14:52:07] <robertmaxrees> so just use those.
[14:52:12] <robertmaxrees> no extra dependencies needed.
[14:52:44] <setuid> About 900k of js gets logged to console when I use that
[14:52:52] <robertmaxrees> right
[14:52:58] <robertmaxrees> so you confirmed it's there.
[14:53:01] <taplar> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/modal/
[14:53:04] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to do anything else with that console.log
[14:53:17] <robertmaxrees> just use the modal code that's there following the instructions taplar just linked.
[14:54:04] <setuid> Looks like a bunch of html wrapped around some jquery code, so will it work without _any_ of that html and css?
[14:54:15] <robertmaxrees> you have the html and css on the page already.
[14:54:18] <setuid> I just need an in-page alert() to fire every time the page changes and specific strings are detected
[14:54:27] <robertmaxrees> slowwwww dowwwwnnnn
[14:54:30] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening
[14:55:01] <robertmaxrees> the modal code is already on the page.  so you can just use what's there.  it will work because it's already on the page./
[14:55:18] <setuid> There is absolutely _zero_ modal code on the page I'm parsing. None.
[14:55:26] <robertmaxrees> jfc
[14:55:31] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.modal is it
[14:55:33] <robertmaxrees> that's what you need
[14:55:35] <robertmaxrees> that's the code
[14:55:38] <robertmaxrees> for modals
[14:55:49] <robertmaxrees> so there IS code on that page for modals
[14:56:04] <setuid> Ok, so I need to wrap the entire tampermonkey script in the jquery document object, so I can use that syntax, yes?
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> if $.fn.modal works, then you're good to go.
[14:56:49] <robertmaxrees> doesn't tampermonkey have options to fire on doc ready?
[14:57:07] <taplar> it does that by default, iirc
[14:57:12] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[14:57:13] <robertmaxrees> so you'
[14:57:17] <robertmaxrees> *you're g2gf
[14:57:19] <robertmaxrees> *g2g
[14:58:02] <setuid> Nope, no fn.modal on this page, I'll keep banging on some other ideas, this is why I've had to create these weird constructs, because what's assumed to be there/possible, isn't.
[14:58:06] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[14:58:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:58:17] <taplar> i feel like we're missing something
[14:58:17] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.modal ?
[14:58:28] <robertmaxrees> you logged this out earlier in your script
[14:58:36] <robertmaxrees> suddenly things are changing
[14:58:41] <setuid> Correct, that doesn't seem to produce any modal content, when I pass in my var to that constructyor
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> lmaoi
[14:58:53] <robertmaxrees> you have to do more with it.
[14:58:58] <robertmaxrees> did you even ready the docs?
[14:59:02] <taplar> like, bootstrap on it's own isn't going to override the native alert.  so something someone has written has done that.  so their logic would be using the existing markup for the alerts, or, it could be dynamically creating the dom elements when executing
[14:59:29] <robertmaxrees> right.  all setuid needs to do is manually create a modal and pop it when necessary.
[15:02:28] <setuid> "manually create a modal", is not working... but I'm googleing for some functional examples to get me started
[15:02:36] <setuid> I suspect I'm not actually enabling jquery inside this construct
[15:02:40] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried?
[15:02:54] <robertmaxrees> and if you did $.fn.modal from within the script earlier, then it's enabled.
[15:03:07] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing more to do, since you're using what's already on the page/.
[15:08:16] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:19:22] <paule32> hello
[16:19:31] <paule32> i have this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/614pcrj7/1/
[16:19:56] <paule32> i would like to open a menu, when user click on a div (menu)
[16:20:17] <paule32> i use easyui
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> back up
[16:20:40] <robertmaxrees> why do you have "javascript 1.7" selected there?
[16:20:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:21:07] <paule32> not good?
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> completely unnecessary (shrug)
[16:21:29] <robertmaxrees> also: if you're using easyui, why isn't it in the fiddle?
[16:22:01] <paule32> i am new with it
[16:22:13] <robertmaxrees> how does that answer my question?? lol
[16:22:16] <setuid> Sorry, pulled into meetings, back on track. So in short, I need to look for a way to detect page changed, figure out how to buid a modal dialog that mimics an 'alert()' dialog, figure out how to stop multiple dialogs from overlaying each other before the previous is dismissed, and detect the default/selected item in a select option list.
[16:22:40] <paule32> i don't know, how to include
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/cQg6ba5.png
[16:23:22] <robertmaxrees> setuid okie
[16:30:47] <paule32> the lib is not in list
[16:31:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:31:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to find a place that's hosting it and drop the link in there.
[16:40:02] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/614pcrj7/2/
[16:40:53] <robertmaxrees> kill tyhe javascript 1.7 duder
[16:41:11] <robertmaxrees> also: left: 20px, is not valid.
[16:41:17] <robertmaxrees> you need quotes around the 20px
[16:42:18] <robertmaxrees> and finally - where'd you get "mousepress" from?? that's not a js event.
[16:43:06] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/614pcrj7/4/
[16:43:53] <paule32> https://jsfiddle.net/paule32/614pcrj7/5/
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> so what's up with that event?
[16:44:45] <paule32> it dont work
[16:44:58] <robertmaxrees> where did you see "mousepress" as an event??
[16:46:49] <robertmaxrees> also: https://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/mb/menu.php
[16:46:59] <robertmaxrees> easyui has built-in features for things like menus.
[16:47:30] <paule32> i have a div (as menubar)
[16:47:54] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:47:59] <paule32> into this div, i have sub div's
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> https://www.jeasyui.com/tutorial/mb/menu.php
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> this shows you what you want ot do.
[16:48:09] <robertmaxrees> *to do
[16:48:12] <robertmaxrees> so use it?
[16:48:23] <paule32> oh, oversee it
[16:48:31] <paule32> hmmmm
[16:48:46] <robertmaxrees> also: easyui doesn't require jquery ui.
[16:48:51] <robertmaxrees> completely separate project.
[16:49:02] <paule32> ah i see
[16:49:12] <paule32> this menu is verticaly
[16:49:53] <paule32> but i need nl
[16:49:56] <paule32> woops
[16:50:01] <robertmaxrees> horizontal?
[16:50:06] <paule32> yes
[16:50:42] <robertmaxrees> https://www.jeasyui.com/documentation/index.php -> https://i.imgur.com/Xhci0hm.png
[16:51:06] <robertmaxrees> click on the "menubutton" link and you'll see what you want.
[16:51:20] <paule32> oh i see
[16:51:25] <paule32> thank you
[16:51:32] <robertmaxrees> try reading the docs first ;)
[17:49:12] <paule32> hui
[17:49:20] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[17:49:29] <paule32> i found firefox debug console poweful
[17:50:20] <paule32> few month in the future, and using them, i be happy
[17:50:36] <paule32> software will be better, and better
[17:50:44] <paule32> thanks open source
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> lool
[17:51:41] <robertmaxrees> cool
[18:32:40] <paule32> what is property/value component?
[18:32:51] <paule32> feature of easyui?
[18:34:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:34:27] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing it mentioned?
[18:35:57] <paule32> http://jeasyui.com/themebuilder/index.php#
[18:36:04] <paule32> left side
[18:36:09] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[18:36:22] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with jquery
[18:36:45] <paule32> is this component in easy ui?
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> reread what i just said :)
[18:37:12] <robertmaxrees> and then see if you can't figure out the answer yourself.
[18:38:17] <paule32> ah i see
[18:38:19] <paule32> PropertyGrid
[18:38:25] <robertmaxrees> dunno (shrug)
[18:38:32] <robertmaxrees> this isn't an easyui support channel
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:56:36] <Cypris> When i attach event DOMNodeRemoved to $("div.myDiv"), store some data using $("div.myDiv").data("someData","the data");, I am unable to access what i stored with data when the DOMNodeRemoved Event fires. When removing an element, what would be the event to listen for in which $("div.myDiv").data("someData") would still return it's value?
[23:19:20] <robertmaxrees> why do you want the data attribute value when it's removed?
[23:19:30] <robertmaxrees> why not refactor to get that data before removing it?
[23:40:52] <robertmaxrees> welp
[23:59:48] <Cypris> lol of course, a response atfer i stopped paying attention to my irc client
