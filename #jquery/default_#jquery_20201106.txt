[02:21:19] <Guest77> Hi! Can somebody help me with some weirdness I'm experiencing?
[02:23:35] <undefined_bob> Guest77: just ask your question and at best provide a test case on jsfiddle.net or something.
[02:24:06] <Guest77> Somehow, JQ no longer returns JQuery objects, but only basically arrays of DOM elements. Huh? What's up with that? What could be causing this? O.o Does this sound familiar to any of you?
[03:01:19] <Guest77> wait, that's not quite it... my debugger is just displaying it weirdly differently o.o ...the methods of the prototype are still there. But anyway, I can't get JQuery UI to work, all function calls throw the "[function name] is not a function" type error. I AM first including regular jQ, then jQ UI. They both get loaded with a regular 200 "found"
[03:01:20] <Guest77> GET return code. There are no double inclusions. What could be going wrong here?
[03:01:23] <Guest77> https://pastebin.com/s3a1gzJV
[03:05:47] <Guest77> ooooooooh WTF!
[03:07:21] <Guest77> Sorry, I just realized my jQ UI .js file included nothing but the header comment and "undefined". The download builder on https://jqueryui.com/download/#!themeParams=none still has problems, I see
[03:13:29] <Guest77> The minified version, anyway. The unminified version was fine.
[06:54:18] <IHasFingers> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/dsxLjm4c/ why does the url look like <a href="dashboard.io?view=" 30"="">View</a>
[06:54:28] <IHasFingers> it adds a space and the =""
[06:56:41] <IHasFingers> actually ignore me
[09:34:22] <jak2000> hi all
[09:34:36] <jak2000> how to validate a string if is only numbers?
[09:38:37] <jak2000> how to validate a string if is only numbers?onlly digits
[09:38:46] <jak2000> sorry for last... line
[11:05:25] <Cork> jak2020: regex
[11:58:28] <Dav281> I have a query - J
[12:32:41] <pavonia> O.o
[12:32:54] <Gh0st_Preacher> :shrug:
[13:59:34] <Miles8of9> if (data.something.somethingelse) { .... }   if data.something doesn't exist i get an error so to avoid it what should i write? if (data.something && data.something.somethingelse) { ....?
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> woops, dropped for a sec.
[14:02:14] <robertmaxrees> anyway - Miles8of9 not a jq question, but it depends on what version of JS you're using.
[14:02:57] <Miles8of9> the one built into firefox?? O_O
[14:03:15] <robertmaxrees> heh, i mean ES5, ES2015, ES2016...
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> are you transpiling and polyfilling where necessary?
[14:03:35] <Miles8of9> ?_?
[14:03:44] <Miles8of9> what?
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> newer browsers support newer versions of javascript, complete with new features that, for instance, make handling cases like this fairly trivial.
[14:04:37] <Miles8of9> mmm.. i should keep IE11 compatibility
[14:05:04] <robertmaxrees> then what you put will work fine unless you use something like babel to transpile down to ES5.
[14:05:40] <Miles8of9> ok so what i wrote it's not too bad
[14:05:55] <robertmaxrees> for old-school JS, it's effectively all you've got.
[14:21:25] <mllie> Hi, how can I show all eventhandlers of an event?
[17:44:40] <Braden`> Hello!
[17:44:42] <Braden`> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).serializeObject is not a function.  I Google'd this error, but the results were not clear.  It says its not a core function.  I am using the JQuery library, but... am I missing something?
[18:08:37] <shoky> Braden`: jquery has no .serializeObject() method
[18:08:58] <shoky> it has .serializeArray()
[18:11:31] <shoky> easy to get an object out of that e.g.  const foo = $('#myform').serializeArray().reduce((obj, {name, value}) => ({...obj, [name]: value}), {})
[18:18:19] <Braden`> shoky:  Thank you for the reply.  What if I am just wanting to serialize a form?  That is not an object I do not think
[18:18:23] <Braden`> Is it treated as an array?
[18:27:06] <shoky> Braden`: not sure what you're asking..
[18:27:47] <shoky> there are many ways to serialize a form.  .serialize() is one  .serializeArray() is another
[18:28:09] <shoky> and if you want an object.. what i showed before
[18:34:44] <robertmaxrees> ah they shotgunned the question :/
[19:22:04] <Braden`> robertmaxrees:  Shotgunned?
[19:22:22] <robertmaxrees> sent the question out to multiple channels at around the same time :)
[19:27:50] <Braden`> It was accidental actually.  I meant to ask in #jquery but accidentally asked in ##javascript.
[19:27:58] <Braden`> Then realized my mistake :)
[19:28:18] <Braden`> I was half expecting, "You are using JQuery.  Ask in #jquery."
[22:56:17] <Guest27> hey guys
[22:56:33] <robertmaxrees> Hello
[22:58:05] <Guest27> I just wanna say that the link on this page https://jquery.com/browser-support/ on "About Browser Support" is pointing to wrong version of oldversion.com instead of http://www.oldversion.com/ maybe someone can fix the link. Thanks.
[23:00:06] <robertmaxrees> thanks for saying something - mind filing a bug with thge website's repo?  you can do so here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues :)
[23:03:37] <Guest27> Done, thank you soo much: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/212
[23:04:12] <robertmaxrees> Def - thanks for filing it!  Fair warning, might take a while to get addressed.  You can also submit a fix yourself via a PR if you want :)  your call.
