[09:48:59] <codecutter> 'mouseneter' does not work if i'm appending the selector to the dom
[09:49:05] <codecutter> https://jsfiddle.net/5x7h1b1p/7/

[14:22:16] <isthisreallife> hey
[14:25:06] <printForever> hello
[14:25:15] <printForever> stupid question, easy answer
[14:25:21] <printForever> why is .hover triggerd on page load
[14:25:32] <printForever> I haven't hovered over the item, nor is the mouse anywhere close
[14:25:40] <printForever> but the ".hover" is triggered on page load
[14:26:12] <printForever> I know I can do it .on("hover", fun...
[14:26:30] <printForever> but I want to know why is .hover triggered on page load even though the element itself isn't hovered
[14:56:30] <shoky> what page?
[15:12:55] <printForever> solved it
[15:14:09] <Al_nz1> is #home a selector that defined the whole page?
[15:42:52] <toothfairy_> Hi ... Using the following to set the height of an iframe to avoid scroll. What if I want to set the same height of a div afterwards? https://dpaste.de/VU0N
[15:54:27] <Al_nz1> is this syntax correct? $(this).closest('.panel-body').find("label:contains('iwi')").hide();
[20:58:54] <xaxxon> trying to write a greasemonkey/tampermonkey/userscript script to click a javascript-only link.   So far I have: jQuery(report_button).find("a").trigger("click"); and I’ve tried some other combinations as well, but it’s not doing anyhting obvious and not doing the same as manually clicking the link.   the button in the dom looks like: <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="reportbtn access-required" data-event-action="report">report</a>
[21:00:23] <xaxxon> well, if I type it in on the console it works.. so I’m doing something silly elsewhere
