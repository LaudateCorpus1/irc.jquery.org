[00:09:05] <Uhkis> dopie: just as you would put regular jquery anywhere
[00:18:43] <dopie> welp
[00:18:46] <dopie> i found an easier one
[00:18:47] <dopie> :)
[00:18:52] <dopie> http://leanmodal.finelysliced.com.au/#
[00:22:14] <phiz> dopie: why not bootstrap
[00:22:42] <dopie> phiz meh
[00:22:43] <dopie> :)
[00:28:05] <Bheam> yo
[00:28:14] <Bheam> does jquery have a scope for storing global variables?
[00:28:24] <Uhkis> i'm so close to actually opening saynotobootstrap.com
[00:29:16] <systemfault> Uhkis:Sad… thought it would exist
[00:29:39] <systemfault> Bheam: Define “storing"
[00:31:01] <Uhkis> bootstrap is fine, but after seeing 100000000 sites using the default unmodified components, it's starting to feel like cancer
[00:31:11] <Bheam> ok so i have created some jquery plugins, and i want to expose a method on the jquery object like $.fn.myHover(), however i want each plugin to hook into this function and decide the behaviour when used on that particular object type? any suggestions?
[00:31:26] <systemfault> bootstrap is crap.
[00:31:58] <Cork> Bheam: object type?
[00:32:11] <Bheam> by class
[00:32:14] <Cork> Bheam: jquery works on dom elements, not random objects
[00:32:22] <Yahkob> bootstrap and less is kind of not crap though ;D
[00:32:29] <Bheam> well element type, defined by class, tag, id or otherwise
[00:32:48] <Cork> ok so you want to call different plugins based on the class on the element?
[00:33:03] <Bheam> say $('BODY').myHover() does something but $('.slideshow').myHover() does something else
[00:33:22] <Bheam> and i want each plugin to have responsibility of the functionality, not in one common place for code
[00:33:34] <systemfault> Yahkob: So keep using it instead of learning CSS.
[00:33:41] <Yahkob> haha
[00:33:42] <Bheam> if they don't hook in, they get default functionality
[00:33:45] <Yahkob> touche systemfault
[00:33:47] <Cork> Bheam: i would add an array to a connection plugin
[00:33:54] <Cork> Bheam: this plugin implements the function name
[00:34:12] <Cork> Bheam: this function loops the array and check for the plugin that wants the control
[00:34:17] <Yahkob> not saying I don't know css but bootstrap can be ok in some conditions
[00:35:19] <Bheam> Can't i use custom events and check if they're defined on said element or something?
[00:35:20] <Cork> like if(options.plugins[i].test(this)) { options.plugin[i].handle.apply(this, arguments); }
[00:35:46] <Cork> Bheam: sure, but you still need a way to find what to call
[00:36:02] <Cork> an element can have multiple classes so that most likely isn't going to work
[00:37:11] <Cork> Bheam: another option is to set the events in a $(this).data('my-handlers')
[00:37:23] <Cork> Bheam: and have each plugin add there event there
[00:37:45] <Cork> and then you can do $(this).trigger($(this).data('my-handlers'), arguments)
[00:38:25] <Cork> Bheam: though i wouldn't recommend firing a lot of custom events for plugin internal communications
[00:40:41] <Bheam> what about $.fn.myHover = function() { if ($(this).data('events').myHover.length) $(this).trigger('myHover'); else /* default */}
[00:41:28] <Cork> Bheam: there are no events
[00:41:42] <Cork> that object has been moved since 1.5
[00:56:31] <djQuery> having a little trouble parsing an xml return from an ajax call
[00:56:40] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/xehod/1/edit
[00:58:12] <djQuery> var xmlDoc = $.parseXML(data), $xml=$(xmlDoc),$a = $xml.find('artist');
[00:58:37] <djQuery> $a.length is always 0 even though there are results in the hmtl
[00:58:42] <djQuery> xml rather
[01:02:30] <djQuery> dang its only 3 in the AM usualy someone here
[01:02:52] <dopie> ok here i sone
[01:02:59] <dopie> heres one
[01:03:28] <xec> djQuery: can you make a demo with the data returned from the ajax call?
[01:03:51] <djQuery> xec, http://jsbin.com/xehod/1/edit
[01:04:00] <djQuery> just look in the console.
[01:04:08] <djQuery> I am console.log the xml there
[01:04:21] <dopie> http://gwhite.staycreativedesign.com/    when i scroll down or click on about the white header text blends in how can i make it where when i click or scroll to white background the header text changes color?
[01:04:31] <djQuery> just click the search button first
[01:04:39] <xec> ah right
[01:07:02] <xec> it looks like $xml is null ?
[01:07:02] <Cork> djinni: $.parseXML fails
[01:07:31] <djQuery> Cork, is it not returning valid xml?
[01:07:41] <Cork> one min
[01:08:05] <Cork> djQuery: http://jsbin.com/cekevona/2/edit
[01:08:08] <xec> data already is a xml doc
[01:08:13] <Cork> djQuery: you double parsed the xml
[01:08:36] * xec high fives cork
[01:08:46] <Cork> :)
[01:09:08] <Cork> djQuery: as long as the server don't lie about the content, you rarely have to parse none html content
[01:09:38] <Cork> well at least not json or xml
[01:10:31] <djQuery> Cork, are you saying I should be able to just do $(data).find('artist').each(function(){
[01:10:55] <xec> yes
[01:11:00] <djQuery> Cork, thanks that worked
[01:11:13] <djQuery> Cork, overcomplicating as usual
[01:11:17] <Cork> <_<
[01:11:26] * Cork shares the thanks with xec
[01:12:24] <djQuery> will eventualy have my music collection under control
[01:14:01] <xec> slayer is a "UK grime MC" artist? lol
[01:16:12] <djQuery> xec, notice that is a person and not a group
[01:16:34] <xec> yes, hence "artist" ;)
[01:16:38] <xec> still funny imo
[01:18:45] <Uhkis> thought slayer was a thrash metal band
[01:19:11] <xec> it is. very famous. which is why it's funny :P
[01:20:23] <djQuery> gonna use music brainz to get a list of all the songs for my favorite bands and automaticaly dl from youtube
[01:22:30] <seutje> haha, why does it return "Vitamin String Quartet" for "slayer"? ;')
[01:23:13] <seutje> ah, the alias
[01:23:28] <seutje> "The String Quartet Tribute to Slayer"...
[01:24:59] <djQuery> seutje, it is way below the ext:score that I  will be looking at
[01:25:29] <seutje> oh, didn't even look at that, was just curious
[01:25:33] <djQuery> soon as I explore thier api a little more
[01:26:15] <Uhkis> xec: well they did do that one weird dnb (or whatever) song
[01:27:49] <djQuery> dopie, and you need to look at $(document).on('scrol', function(){}); and figure out where they have scrolled to
[01:28:01] <djQuery> dopie, seems like a big pain
[01:28:22] <Azrael_-> hi
[01:28:26] <Azrael_-> i'm using the jquery validation plugin and use the css-class "number" for validation the input-data. but i need it to allow not only 0.5 but also 0,5 for the german number format. how can i do this?
[01:29:35] <djQuery> Azrael_-, have you looked at using <input type="number">
[01:30:06] <Azrael_-> djQuery: not yet
[01:30:19] <djQuery> Azrael_-, it would take their local into consideration
[01:31:15] <djQuery> Azrael_-, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18218705/how-to-enable-jquery-validate-localization
[01:32:32] <Azrael_-> i already included the localized messages for the validation plugin but this didn't have any effect on the validation itself. until now only the american number-format is valid, german not
[01:35:56] <djQuery> Azrael_-, gues your going to have to look at jQuery.validator.addMethod
[01:36:20] <djQuery> Azrael_-, then you could add a method that parsed it both ways
[01:38:20] <Azrael_-> ok, hoped there was alreadz something built in for this but ok, then i|ll do it manually, thanks
[01:39:03] <djQuery> Azrael_-, Added in support for HTML5 input types, fixes #97
[01:42:40] <djQuery> Azrael_-, can you recreate it here? http://jsbin.com/hepix/1/edit
[01:42:50] <djQuery> allready got you started a little
[01:47:56] <djQuery> Azrael_-, http://jsbin.com/hepix/1/edit
[01:51:31] <fossrox> hi everyone! does anybody know the best way to load jquery into firefox's scratchapad? is <script src="path/to/jquery.js"></script> within the page the only way to do it?
[01:53:18] <Azrael_-> djQuery: just tried to recreate it here, no luck. guess i have some other errors here in my form which i have to investigate. thanks for proving me wrong
[02:01:21] <Cork> fossrox: var script = document.createElement('script'); script.src = 'url'; document.head.append(script);
[02:05:34] <fossrox> Cork: than you!
[02:05:40] <Cork> np
[02:43:57] <Feel_> Hello. I use jQuery draggable plugin. I set helper:clone option, but I want invisible helper. How to do it?
[02:44:17] <StephenS> jsfiddle it, we don't know plugin.
[02:56:15] <Cork> weee... that was fun...
[02:58:29] <Jattenalle> Feel_, use a custom helper that is empty
[02:58:48] <Jattenalle> Feel_, see http://jqueryui.com/draggable/#visual-feedback and the custom helper option
[02:58:56] <Jattenalle> empty/blank
[03:27:07] <xec> for no particular reason, i was researching the etymology for the word "super"
[03:27:08] <xec> http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/super#Etymology_1
[03:27:18] <xec> check out "derived terms" O.o
[03:28:00] <brunoais> xec, super!
[03:28:13] <brunoais> now super makes more sence in programming :d
[04:24:45] <kblin> hi folks
[04:25:09] <StephenS> hi
[04:25:18] <kblin> I'm currently playing with deferred objects, and am trying to solve the following
[04:25:26] <StephenS> give jsfiddle
[04:26:16] <kblin> I've got a single-page webapp that offloads a comptutation job to the server. the server might or might not have the result for the computation job cached
[04:26:31] <StephenS> give jsfiddle
[04:26:57] <kblin> I don't have one yet, I'm still trying to figure out if my architecture works
[04:28:48] <kblin> what I'm trying to find out is if I can create a deferred that'll keep triggering ajax requests once in a while until the respose JSON object from the server contains '"state": "done"' instead of '"state": "pending"'
[04:29:25] <Cork> kblin: you would have to bind it in a setTimeout loop
[04:29:35] <Cork> kblin: create a function that does the call
[04:29:38] <Jattenalle> kblin, just have a function that checks, and if the state is pending, set it as a timeout
[04:29:46] <Jattenalle> set itself as a timeout*
[04:30:06] <Cork> and in the done callback check if it is pending and if it isn't do setTimeout(make_call, 5000)
[04:32:20] <kblin> right, I'm just trying to wrap this in a deferred so I can propoerly check that the value will eventually converge to the result in my unit tests
[04:44:29] <anli_> I am trying to scroll a window with scrollTop using kendo ui, but on a mobile device, the scroller uses transforms instead, so the scroll is not recongnized as one, how do I get access to the mobile scroller?
[04:45:02] <anli_> I assume the mobile scroller handles this automatically
[04:57:42] <bberry> Cork: So im using the elem gen thing we created not long ago. But now i have a 'template' of what an element should look like, and i need to create an array of these templates.  However, i ALSO need to fill each of these array items with individual text elements.  The problem is, since the 'template' is a user input, i cant guarantee where the text elements are going to be. http://jsfiddle.net/aHK7Y/
[04:59:00] <bberry> Cork: So basically, i loop through the 'text' array and i want to replace the each of the text node values with the element that is current being indexed in the loop.  Do i need to recursively go through the template and replace them i guess?
[05:09:24] <t432> Not sure where to insert the callback url to the server to retrive the data, http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[05:09:39] <t432> for the server*
[05:11:19] <MagePsycho> ReferenceError: event is not defined
[05:11:19] <MagePsycho> 	
[05:11:20] <MagePsycho> (667 out of range 650)
[05:11:25] <MagePsycho> what does this mean guys?
[05:12:35] <Uhkis> you tried to select index 667 out of 650 length array?
[05:16:42] <t432> I'm working with thw plugin http://www.infinite-scroll.com/, not sure where to place the callback url (url for the server to retrieve the json data), here is what I have so far (as instructed in site) http://pastebin.com/HWELE8cx:
[05:18:00] <t432> anyone?
[05:18:51] <hlfw0rd> I am using the touchwipe plugin for jquery. I am also using highcharts. It seems while using highcharts, a swipe event can easily be triggered on tablets/phones. Does anyone know of a way I can disable touchwipe on the page or those specific elements?
[05:19:45] <bberry> I have an interesting problem... Its explained in the fiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/72GSv/2/
[05:23:51] <anli_> Is there a way to dump everything that is stored with .data?
[05:24:07] <anli_> So I can find which element that uses a certain key
[05:24:40] <StephenS> yeah
[05:28:07] <rindolf> bberry: hi.
[05:28:18] <rindolf> bberry: so what's the issue?
[05:31:52] <anli_> Can a selector find elements that have a certain .data key?
[05:32:22] <anli_> oh, found it
[05:32:24] <anli_> :data()
[05:32:56] <MikeD_> data() is a nice wrapper for .attr('data-*')
[05:33:02] <Cork> no
[05:33:18] <Cork> data is more then attr('data-*)
[05:33:29] <Cork> it is an internal cache inside jquery
[05:33:40] <Cork> it only touches the attribute if the cache is empty
[05:33:59] <bberry> rindolf: haha yeah i just noticed that its actually working already XD
[05:34:04] <Cork> and .data converts json, supports object pointers and so on
[05:34:12] <rindolf> bberry: OK. :-)
[05:34:12] <MikeD_> is there a case where .data('foo') won't be the value that's in .attr('data-foo') ?
[05:34:18] <Cork> sure
[05:34:36] <Hyperking> anyone know how to remove the time info from javascript date object? with jquery
[05:34:50] <MikeD_> Cork:  explain?
[05:34:59] <Cork> var elm =$('<div data-foo="a">'); elm.data('foo', 'b') attr = a data == b
[05:35:36] <Cork> var elm =$('<div data-foo="a">'); var d = elm.data('foo') elm.attr('data-foo', 'b' attr = b data == a
[05:35:39] <brunoais> Cork, that's why I don't really like using .data() to write information
[05:35:51] <anli_> Seems var elements = $(':data("kendoMobileScroller")'); was not recozniged
[05:35:54] <anli_> recognized
[05:35:56] <anli_> :)
[05:36:09] <Cork> brunoais: if you fetch data through .data you would get problem if you set it through .attr
[05:36:23] <MikeD_> so would you advise not using .data() if you are after html5 data-* values?
[05:36:24] <doberman> Cork, does that mean it's not smart to use .data() to get data- attribute values
[05:36:25] <Cork> brunoais: you should use either never mix
[05:36:31] <anli_> Oh, its jquery 1.10 maybe
[05:36:34] <brunoais> Cork, why is that a problem? It goes to the DOM when it does not find, does it?
[05:36:40] <Cork> dobalina: it's find as long as you don't mix
[05:36:47] <Cork> brunoais: no it doesn't
[05:36:56] <Cork> it goes to the dom if it isn't in its cache
[05:37:04] <Cork> see the second example i made
[05:37:13] <brunoais> Cork, oh. right!
[05:37:24] <doberman> Cork, but .data() will be a bit slower since it's additionaly checks the query storage?
[05:37:31] <brunoais> Cork, it caches the data attributr reads, right?
[05:37:38] <Cork> doberman: it falls back to the dom, so no it isn't slower
[05:37:40] <brunoais> doberman, I guess so
[05:37:50] <Cork> brunoais: kinda it caches the converted data
[05:37:52] <brunoais> doberman, but only for the 1st time
[05:37:54] <doberman> but first it checks the storage than fall back to the dom
[05:38:13] <doberman> then*
[05:38:15] <brunoais> anyway, the action is super fast
[05:38:29] <brunoais> and I prefer to store data in the DOM. I only don't do it when it is impossible
[05:38:30] <anli_> Wait a second, is there a jquery 1.11.x already?
[05:38:35] <anli_> I thought 1.9.x was hot
[05:38:39] <brunoais> anli_, sure
[05:38:45] <brunoais> quite a while ago, tbh
[05:38:51] <Cork> brunoais, dobalina what it does is var data = $.internal_data[key] || /* convert $(this).attr('data-' + key) */
[05:39:04] <Cork> psudo code
[05:39:09] <bberry> afaik theyre up to like 2.1.0 or something
[05:39:33] <Cork> bberry: 2.x and 1.1x is in sync
[05:39:35] <t432> Cork: can you help understand this? http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[05:39:38] <Cork> both are modern
[05:39:42] <bberry> interesting
[05:39:54] <Cork> t432: what part of it=
[05:39:56] <Cork> *?
[05:40:18] <bberry> Cork: why are they updating 2 versions?
[05:40:27] <fn> http://pastie.org/9145851 why does line 24 not work?
[05:40:27] <Cork> bberry: one has pre ie9 support one doesn't
[05:40:32] <bberry> ah gotcha
[05:40:33] <t432> Cork: the part that rtrives the data from the  server, where do I insert the url?
[05:41:06] <anli_> I tried to upgrade, still the selector on https://api.jqueryui.com/data-selector/ did not work
[05:41:19] <Cork> t432: opps works calling
[05:41:22] <Cork> can't do it now
[05:41:43] <t432> Cork: give me a nudge when you get back.
[05:42:15] <bberry> Cork: genious > http://jsfiddle.net/72GSv/5/
[05:42:42] <t432> in the meantime, any input from others will be helpful.
[05:43:22] <brunoais> bberry, what is that?
[05:43:44] <t432> brunoais: was the for me?
[05:43:48] <t432> that*
[05:44:16] <brunoais> t432, hum? I didn't understand
[05:44:28] <t432> i mean was your last comment for me?
[05:44:35] <bberry> brunoais: some stuff he was helping me out with.  Basically it just an html generator from JSON.  The 'replaceText' function replaces all text nodes with the indexed element in the textData array.
[05:44:41] <bberry> s/he/Cork/
[05:45:19] <brunoais> bberry, it is quite simple to do, tbh :D. good luck
[05:46:34] <t432> brunoais: where do I insert the url callback to retrieve the data from the server?  http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[05:46:35] <bberry> haha yeah its not hard, just took me a while to get all the recursion working properly
[05:47:08] <brunoais> t432, how should I know :)? I didn't do that thing
[05:47:18] <brunoais> infinite scroll thingies are super easy to make
[05:47:45] <t432> why reinvent the wheel?
[05:47:52] <brunoais> I even made 1 for the lulz this weekend in some minutes (less than the time I took to search and learn to use one made from another person)
[05:48:14] <brunoais> t432, because they are super easy to make
[05:48:29] <brunoais> and the ones that are more flexible are usualyl harder to use because they need a lot fo options
[05:49:02] <brunoais> others enforce a certain HTML structure and others use innerHTML like no tomorrow
[05:49:13] <t432> brunoais: tell me how would you make one.
[05:51:09] <Hyperking> better yet, how could i use .split() to remove every character after T?
[05:52:29] <Hyperking> remove all characters after "T" 2014-05-06T12:49:52.292Z
[05:52:36] <rindolf> Hyperking: shouldn't you use a regex?
[05:52:57] <pastry> Hyperking, split by T, you obtain an array of 2, and you take the first part
[05:53:03] <Hyperking> rindolf: looking online, there is no other way
[05:53:20] <excarna> In what cases will `on` not be available on a jQuery element?
[05:53:31] <pastry> yeah, there are various ways, split, regex, and parsing time
[05:53:35] <excarna> I am using jquery-1.8.1 and I get weird transient "Object [object Object] has no method `on`"
[05:53:36] <brunoais> Hyperking, split('T')[0]
[05:54:11] <rindolf> Hyperking: "2014-05-06T12:49:52.292Z".split('T')[0]
[05:55:01] <Hyperking> rindolf: ty jquery date objects are wonky. should be a simplier way
[05:55:24] <rindolf> Hyperking: OK.
[05:55:25] <Hyperking> sent enough time on this little script
[05:56:02] <MikeD_> if you're just trying to get the date from a datetime, that split solution is pretty straightforward
[05:56:12] <MikeD_> ... until there is no T
[05:57:12] <MikeD_> but yeah, it's a tedious problem... best to use a library (even if you write one for your environment)
[05:58:11] <Hyperking> rindolf: finally after 48hrs..learned much ty MikeD_ http://jsfiddle.net/mCuWS/18/
[06:00:00] <MikeD_> Hyperking: my $0.02 - be careful making variable names like 'td' to reference not an obvious table detail... but instead a date (or something else)
[06:00:18] <MikeD_> i'm all about the easy-to-type, but easy-to-read/understand should come first
[06:00:57] <brunoais> MikeD_, my $0.02 <td> -> table data, not table detail ;)
[06:01:17] <Hyperking> MikeD_:absolutely right
[06:01:40] <Hyperking> comes from my inexperience using jquery
[06:01:57] <MikeD_> brunoais: i concede.  same point though
[06:02:28] <decx> my $0.02 is actually just one euro cent :(
[06:02:49] <MikeD_> how many BTC ?
[06:03:04] <Hyperking> ty decx: your euros are well noted :)
[06:03:56] * brunoais par pats decx
[06:03:56] <brunoais>  poor boy
[06:04:05] <walidvb> guys, before i kill someone
[06:04:57] <walidvb> i'm trying to use jquery's orientationchange event. when I get window.orientation I get either ±90 or 0, which doesn't seem related in any way to the actual orientation of the screen
[06:05:04] <walidvb> what's up with that??
[06:05:06] * xec hides from walidvb
[06:05:16] <walidvb> xec you better run
[06:05:19] <walidvb> ;P
[06:07:15] <StephenS> you gotta believe
[06:08:37] <aquatix> walidvb: iirc, that depends on the type of device/browser too
[06:08:40] <excarna> In what cases will `on` not be available on a jQuery element?
[06:08:48] <excarna> I am using jquery-1.8.1 and I get weird transient "Object [object Object] has no method `on`" errors
[06:09:18] <walidvb> aquatix: ouch. so how can I deal with that?
[06:09:31] <walidvb> i'm ready to outsource debugging on this one, can't see it anymore..
[06:09:39] <xec> excarna: my $0.02: it's not a jquery object
[06:09:49] <walidvb> end goal is collinfontaine.ch/app/
[06:10:00] <walidvb> excarna: i agree with xec, who's hiding.
[06:10:09] <excarna> hm
[06:10:17] <excarna> and yet it works sometimes?
[06:10:28] <excarna> this is very frustrating
[06:10:35] <xec> excarna: what does your code look like
[06:10:52] <excarna> xec: it's twitter bootstrap that's failing
[06:10:59] <excarna> http://bpaste.net/show/260564/
[06:11:05] <excarna> line 4
[06:11:15] <excarna> I do see that jQuery is being passed into scope as a function argument
[06:11:31] <excarna> so maybe someone is passing in a dummy jquery object
[06:12:00] <xec> um, is this just the end of the file?
[06:12:12] <xec> line 11 seems to be missing a start
[06:12:38] <walidvb> hm line 0 seems to be missing, imho
[06:12:39] <excarna> xec: no, it's an excerpt from twitter bootstrap
[06:12:46] <excarna> I could paste the entire file
[06:12:48] <xec> so yes
[06:12:49] <excarna> but it's thousands of lines
[06:15:16] <walidvb> how do i get, in mobile, viewport height vs window height?
[06:16:20] <xec> there's no way to tell whats wrong with the information you've supplied
[06:16:52] <excarna> xec: I think I've narrowed it down anyway
[06:17:12] <excarna> this code is setting window.jQuery to be a jQuery object loaded in from requirejs ._.
[06:21:02] <t432>  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'offsetHeight' of undefined on line if (win.scrollY + 1000 > $(document).body.offsetHeight) {}
[06:23:42] <brunoais> t432, there's no body property on a jQuery object
[06:24:24] <t432> so what will be the correct way to achive something similar>
[06:25:15] <t432> i think I need 'document' instead of $(document)
[06:30:24] <walidvb> t432: try it :P
[06:46:19] <zylophone> question: why does this draggable clone helper disappear and the original drag item used as the code to copy into the sortable? http://jsfiddle.net/7ZBQM/2/
[06:47:35] <fn> any idea why the trigger in else not work? http://pastie.org/9145974
[06:48:43] <walidvb> fn: did you try logging anim=
[06:48:46] <walidvb> ?
[06:50:17] <fn> walidvb: logging?
[06:50:24] <walidvb> fn console.log
[06:54:52] <fn> walidvb: console.log(animation) ?
[06:54:57] <walidvb> anim
[06:55:00] <walidvb> console.log(anim)
[06:55:13] <walidvb> that allows you to read the value of a variable within the console
[06:58:57] <fn> walidvb: it's not the animation
[06:59:05] <fn> the trigger event will not be triggered
[06:59:12] <walidvb> well the else would be triggered if anim == true, no?
[07:00:11] <fn> first line: positioning, works.
[07:00:19] <fn> second line in the else: trigger < doesn't work.
[07:01:03] <fn> here it's live: http://marcwyss.me/mw/
[07:01:18] <fn> button navigation (in images), it works when it goes up/down
[07:01:23] <fn> but not on initial load
[07:18:30] <walidvb> fn: what should i look at?
[07:30:22] <walidvb> alright guys, 50$ to who can debug and make this work on smartphones: collinfontaine.ch/app/
[07:31:03] <walidvb> to reproduce the issue: open on smartphone, rotate to landscape, rotate back to portrait.
[07:31:20] <walidvb> code avail. on demand
[07:31:33] <walidvb> written in coffee, and angular
[07:32:11] <walidvb> API availablle from any source(you just need some kind of CORS extension or smth)
[07:32:15] <fn> walidvb: post you a link :/
[07:32:26] <walidvb> fn again, i was gone.
[07:32:47] <fn> marcwyss.me/mw
[07:32:50] <walidvb> i saw your link, but please let me know what I hsould be looking at exavlty?
[07:33:03] <fn> initial load doesn't work
[07:33:08] <walidvb> what should it do?
[07:33:14] <fn> when you go up on the slide (right navigation) and back, it works.
[07:33:57] <walidvb> so you want the car to be moving on page load, do i get this right?
[07:34:08] <fn> nono.
[07:34:14] <fn> the animation in the space section
[07:34:35] <walidvb> oh, ok, the binding isn't there on load.
[07:35:10] <walidvb> btw, you have script as direct child of <html>, i don't know if that's allowed
[07:35:34] <walidvb> where is your script?
[07:35:40] <walidvb> and why do you have bootstrap?
[07:36:46] <fn> it's not only this page what you see there
[07:38:55] <walidvb> ok. which line do you bind?
[07:39:47] <fn> 36
[07:40:11] <walidvb> anyways, it seems like you bind the click event on 'active'
[07:40:18] <walidvb> (what is that event, btw? )
[07:40:40] <walidvb> so either you'd need to trigger 'active' on page load,
[07:41:14] <walidvb> or simply bind the M on pageload, which makes more sense to me.
[07:41:54] <walidvb> fn: problem is probably that the 'active' event only gets triggered on slide change, rather than on page load.
[07:41:55] <fn> hm okey.
[07:42:01] <walidvb> fn got it?
[07:42:29] <walidvb> smth is making my chrome extremely slow, so i can't play with your code atm, but that should do it i think
[07:43:34] <fn> good idea, checked it.
[07:43:38] <fn> should work, got other problem now.
[07:44:28] <walidvb> welcome to programming :P
[07:44:46] <walidvb> i got one bug i can't get rid of, and i literally spent days on it.
[07:44:50] <walidvb> that's how it goes.
[07:45:57] <BillCriswell> Programming is an asshole.
[07:46:03] <BillCriswell> Especially in a browser.
[07:46:29] <BillCriswell> Cause they're all different types of assholes.
[07:48:46] <walidvb> some very assholes.
[07:48:57] <walidvb> BillCriswell: outsourcing a debug, interested?
[07:49:08] <walidvb> i mean i'll pay for it.
[07:49:29] <walidvb> 50$ to make it work on smartphone, working smooooooth on browser
[07:49:37] <BillCriswell> walidvb: I would but I'm on a pretty tight deadline today.
[07:50:12] <walidvb> argh. well, i need this done by friday, spent days on it, not sure i think straight anymore, so i'll be around tmrw as well i suppose :(
[07:50:52] <walidvb> i feel like i need ninjas, atm.
[07:51:15] <doberman> walidvb, is the issue on smartphone only?
[07:51:20] <walidvb> debugging iOS is a PITA, considering you can't really empty cache,+++++1000 reasons
[07:51:23] <walidvb> doberman: yup
[07:51:28] <walidvb> you in? ;)
[07:51:30] <doberman> what os, browser?
[07:51:40] <walidvb> only tested iOS, safari, 7.1.1
[07:51:46] <walidvb> and chrome iOS.
[07:52:05] <walidvb> you can see it at http://collinfontaine.ch/app/
[07:52:09] <BillCriswell> walidvb: I might be able to take a look tonight to see if anything catches my attention. I'd still ask around in here, sure someone will be able to help.
[07:52:26] <walidvb> when you change orientation from landscape to portrait. it makes no sense
[07:52:50] <walidvb> BillCriswell: what doesn't help is that it's all wrapped in an angular directive, which scares off most js devs ^^
[07:53:03] <walidvb> but did already repeatedly, and will do again.
[07:53:33] <BillCriswell> Why is this in angular?
[07:54:55] <walidvb> BillCriswell: wrong choice.
[07:55:09] <walidvb> what can i say. i wanted to learn angular. did too.
[07:55:17] <BillCriswell> I don't even get how angular was in the list of choices for this lol
[07:56:07] <BillCriswell> Nice that you got to learn a bit about it, though!
[07:56:34] <walidvb> BillCriswell: wrong choice, still. anyways, i'm not sure ng is what causes the issue. pretty sure it isn't.
[07:56:49] <BillCriswell> Yeah I don't think so either.
[07:56:56] <walidvb> (caused issues in the past, you can be sure of that, but I managed to understand and fix those)
[07:57:24] <doberman> walidvb, I'm not sure what the problem is, but works fine on android - chrome.
[07:57:43] <walidvb> doberman: when you switch orientation from landscape to portrait?
[07:57:46] <doberman> yes
[07:57:50] <walidvb> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!
[07:57:55] <walidvb> -.-
[07:57:57] <doberman> what should happen?
[07:58:44] <walidvb> on iOS, somehow, the swiper plugin believes that the slide height is 320 (the width of the iphone), and therefore only scrolls 320px down, instead of window.innerHeight
[07:59:15] <walidvb> iOS is a PITA when it comes to computing viewport's height, it doesn't take into account the address bar etc
[08:02:33] <decx> mmmmh pita
[08:02:42] <walidvb> pitapitapitapita
[08:03:23] <walidvb> decx: wanna earn 50$?
[08:03:25] <walidvb> ^^
[08:06:34] <fn> walidvb: added a timeout for triggerin
[08:06:38] <decx> only if i don't have to do anything but make snide remarks
[08:06:45] <walidvb> aha.
[08:06:54] <walidvb> too easy, my friend :D
[08:07:10] <walidvb> if it was like this i'd be a remarker, not a dev.
[08:07:28] <walidvb> (i'd probably be still be a dev, and be really jealous of remarkers..)
[08:08:48] <walidvb> kk guys i'm off. BillCriswell, if you're here tmrw, i'd love your input on that. i really, really can't figure it out. and i'm like 3 times outside my time estimate for this client..
[08:08:57] <walidvb> good luck with your deadline, though
[08:09:12] <BillCriswell> Thanks!
[08:38:43] <BillCriswell> Why do I feel dirty using display: table-cell?
[08:39:31] <Jattenalle> same reason i feel like drinking every time i end up using an actual <table>
[08:39:58] <BillCriswell> Haha
[08:41:34] <BillCriswell> Jattenalle: It just works so beautifully sometimes though.
[08:41:48] <Jattenalle> yup, it's just the easiest tool for the job for some things
[08:41:53] <Jattenalle> it's still horribly ugly though :P
[08:42:24] <decx> like a table
[08:42:47] <BillCriswell> | [ input....          ][ random width button ] |
[08:43:25] <decx> no
[08:45:25] <BillCriswell> My ASCII layouts kick ass.
[08:49:12] <BillCriswell> [ < [ IMG ] > ] <-- Slideshow.
[08:50:35] <draggie> Hi.  What does @ mean in jquery?  For example, what does 'click @target' do?
[08:50:47] <StephenS> I use onkeyup="showResult(this.value)" for a searchbox, however I have esc char, when pressed, box still remains, whats better option to solve it?
[08:50:56] <StephenS> draggie: surpress.
[08:52:52] <draggie> StephenS, as in catch the event but don't do anything with it?  Can you expand on that answer?
[08:53:27] <StephenS> $(document).keyup(function(e) {
[08:53:27] <StephenS>   if (e.keyCode == 27) { $('#livesearch').hide(); }   // esc
[08:53:28] <StephenS> });
[08:53:28] <BillCriswell> draggie: That oesn't look like jQuery.
[08:55:12] <draggie> BillCriswell, yes, it's JS.  I know that 'click #target' means that it will catch the click event for something in the dom with 'id="target"', while 'click .target' is for something with 'class="target"'.  I don't know what '@target' means though.
[08:56:43] <BillCriswell> draggie: Are you just using shorthand for something else like $('#target').on('click', foo) ?
[08:56:58] <draggie> BillCriswell, yes.
[08:57:13] <BillCriswell> draggie: Ok, that's why I wasconfused.
[08:57:27] <BillCriswell> @ in jQuery a while ago used to reference an attribute.
[08:57:55] <draggie> Is it no longer used or recommended for use, BillCriswell
[08:58:04] <BillCriswell> draggie: I'm aware.
[08:58:12] <duch_kazatel> that's why he said "a while ago" :)
[08:58:23] <duch_kazatel> what's the code snippet in question?
[08:58:25] <draggie> duch_kazatel, just verify. :)
[08:59:03] <draggie> duch_kazatel, I saw it on a jquery plugin and was curious what that meant.  That's all.
[08:59:31] <duch_kazatel> what plugin?
[08:59:46] <draggie> the date picker
[09:00:34] <duch_kazatel> where specifically?  sorry, trying to know where in the code you're seing it.
[09:00:55] <draggie> I have to find it again, duch_kazatel.  Hang on.
[09:00:59] <duch_kazatel> mmk.
[09:02:26] <BillCriswell> "Hi.  What does @ mean in jquery?  For example, what does 'click @target' do?" was the original question that I was looking at.
[09:02:34] <dinho> hi how to add placeholder in inputs via jquery?
[09:03:02] <dinho> http://tamand.com.br/~dicaslow/    look  footer newsletter inputs
[09:03:13] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that doesn't look complete.  I wonder if it was JSDoc comments.
[09:03:50] <duch_kazatel> dinho "placeholder"?  you mean the andimated background dealio?
[09:04:13] <dinho> how to put the placeholder dynamically input name and email
[09:04:27] <BillCriswell> I don't even see a placeholder on them.
[09:04:32] <duch_kazatel> same here.
[09:04:46] <duch_kazatel> dinho is that where you want to add the placeholder?
[09:04:50] <duch_kazatel> or is that your example?
[09:04:54] <BillCriswell> $('input').prop('placeholder', 'I am placeholder'); should get you started...
[09:05:19] <dinho> im try
[09:05:48] <duch_kazatel> dinho http://caniuse.com/#search=placeholder <- if you don't need to support older browsers, the placeholder attribute on those inputs should be plenty fine.
[09:06:05] <dinho> http://tamand.com.br/~dicaslow/ here on footer
[09:06:12] <dinho> newsletter inputs
[09:06:19] <duch_kazatel> dinho that site does not have placeholders on it.
[09:06:20] <dinho> use wisija plugin
[09:06:47] <duch_kazatel> if you really need to use javascript to do it, you just set the input value to a default, then delete it on click.
[09:06:56] <dinho> http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/LAfN2/3/
[09:06:58] <duch_kazatel> just be sure you add in logic that checks to see if you've run that logic once before.
[09:07:13] <draggie> duch_kazatel, I can't seem to find it atm.  I'll post it if I run across it again.
[09:07:23] <draggie> Thanks for the answer BillCriswell
[09:07:35] <BillCriswell> draggie: No problem.
[09:07:36] <duch_kazatel> draggie fair enough.
[09:08:18] <duch_kazatel> dinho you fiddle is a different way to do exactly what BillCriswell was suggesting.
[09:09:03] <dinho> would this work on my jquery footer
[09:09:41] <dinho> My input by default do not have placeholder then need to add the email field name placeholder
[09:10:12] <duch_kazatel> the fiddle you posted is one way to do it.
[09:10:19] <duch_kazatel> but that's just an example./
[09:18:49] <duch_kazatel> i'm about to start deprecating mootools out of one of our platforms.
[09:19:01] <bberry> nice
[09:19:09] <bberry> i used that for a while
[09:21:55] <duch_kazatel> we did too.  terrible./
[09:22:21] <BillCriswell> Hm, Atom went open source.
[09:23:40] <duch_kazatel> bberry anything i should know for this project?
[09:35:01] <MikeD_> var target = somedomnode;  $( target ).etc1; $( target ).etc2; $( target ).etc3;    <-- should that be var target = $(somedomnode);  then target.etc1 ...   ?
[09:35:57] <rindolf> MikeD_: it can be.
[09:36:17] <duch_kazatel> MikeD_ you can do it either way.  i prefer to do it the latter.
[09:37:09] <MikeD_> it seems cleaner than invoking $ multiple times
[09:38:51] <duch_kazatel> i would bet that you'd save on resources a little.
[09:39:03] <brunoais> MikeD_, it is faster to invoke only 1ce
[09:39:18] <MikeD_> k, thanks
[09:39:40] <brunoais> it can be the difference between the snappy(!) feel vs fast feel
[09:39:58] <brunoais> ppl like snappy when it is on their prompt
[09:40:15] <brunoais> well, that's on my side from the feedback I get form what I do
[09:41:24] <draggie> what does the '> div' in https://gist.github.com/cngo-github/be82c3e4e6848972155d mean?
[09:41:29] <duch_kazatel> child selector.
[09:41:38] <duch_kazatel> immediate descendent, instead of all descendents.
[09:41:48] <draggie> thanks, duch_kazatel
[09:47:48] <rcw2> hi, can someone explain why this isn't loading splash_image.jpg before the rest of the page, described here: http://tinyurl.com/ltgthzx on this site: http://tinyurl.com/qyhknbw
[09:49:40] <duch_kazatel> rcw2 you probably don't have your css set up properly.
[09:50:09] <rcw2> class should be id, just fixed that.  lets see if it works now
[09:50:36] <EminenceHC> I am grabbing the value of a field setting it as a variable and then running a command. What I am trying to do is only set the variable to the closest thing with id of "full". http://pastie.org/9146348 How can I accomplish this?
[09:51:21] <rcw2> duch_kazatel, you were right.  now, how do i tell the other little menus at the bottom not to load so soon
[09:51:22] <EminenceHC> For example for each .sigPad I want its variable to be the closest "#full" not just a static #full
[09:51:49] <duch_kazatel> rcw2 huh?
[09:52:06] <duch_kazatel> rcw2 you probably need to fix your z-indexing?  not sure - haven't looked.
[09:52:22] <rcw2> duch_kazatel, oh, i think you'd need to see the site
[09:52:40] <duch_kazatel> rcw2 i really don't want to troubleshoot your entire page :)
[09:53:25] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC can you setup a more functioning example in a fiddle?
[09:53:35] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: sure
[10:00:02] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I am trying to do this using signature pad so it is not fiddling properly. http://jsfiddle.net/6sWjw/1/  So there is the same code in each field set. The only difference is the value of the input field with id of "full". Signature pad looks for that value and loads the signature image based of a string. The problem is I only want to call the $('.sigPad') using the value of id #full in its
[10:00:02] <EminenceHC>  own field set, not a static #full set at the beginning.
[10:00:26] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Does that make sense?
[10:01:17] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC you cannot have an ID on a page more than once.
[10:01:32] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Oh deep... ill make it a class then.
[10:01:36] <EminenceHC> derp*
[10:02:21] <duch_kazatel> once you've done that, it sounds like you need to enumerate through each nested_fields and get your data
[10:04:09] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I want to call:  $('.sigPad').signaturePad({displayOnly:true}).regenerate(sig);   where sig is the value of the closest .full
[10:05:52] <duch_kazatel> right - so enumerate through each nested_fields and use $(this).find() to get the value of
[10:05:53] <duch_kazatel> .full
[10:07:53] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I see. Can i do $(this).find() After $('.sigPad').signaturePad({displayOnly:true}).regenerate(sig); or before?
[10:08:17] <duch_kazatel> it'd be before.
[10:08:20] <duch_kazatel> you're really confused.
[10:08:26] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: I am :(
[10:08:32] <duch_kazatel> :) one sec.
[10:08:51] <abailarri> Hello. Anyone can help me? I'm trying to change the image of a leaflet map but I not get results http://jsfiddle.net/XTf7J/1/
[10:10:59] <duch_kazatel> EminenceHC http://jsfiddle.net/6sWjw/2/ it'll look something like this.
[10:12:45] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh makes sense. Very cool. Thank you!
[10:14:16] <gthoma2> I have an odd issue within my Phonegap application in which jquery mobile radio and checkbox widget buttons sometimes maintain a ui-btn-down state even after unchecking all checked property of checkbox and radios. I have made a gist of my code with example radios and function that I've written to reset states of the widgets : https://gist.github.com/galenthomasramos/be28b5ff4e2cfa923d2d
[10:15:03] <gthoma2> This issue happens irregularly and is hard to reproduce...
[10:17:38] <hlfw0rd> I made a simple jquery slider that cycles through images left and right, (format: hide('slide', {direction: 'left'})). Whats the best way to wait for the hide to be finished before starting the show() animation?
[10:20:03] <dwarder> guys what websocket html5 php implementation would you suggest?
[10:20:14] <tw2113> duch_kazatel, how far reaching should $('#foo').siblings reach? should it be selecting ALL siblings under the parent div for example?
[10:20:36] <tw2113> or just immediately adjacent ones?
[10:21:09] <duch_kazatel> all siblings at that current point in the tree.
[10:21:26] <duch_kazatel> dwarder that's buzzword soup.  what are you looking to do?
[10:22:00] <hlfw0rd> essentially, How can I only .show() once .hide() is finished
[10:22:19] <tw2113> ignore terse version: <div id="foo"><select><select><select></div> the .siblings() should select all 3 selects
[10:22:20] <duch_kazatel> hlfw0rd hide() is instant, isn't it?
[10:22:36] <hlfw0rd> duch_kazatel, doesn't have to be: hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000)
[10:22:39] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 huh?
[10:22:50] <duch_kazatel> hlfw0rd ah, you're animating the hide
[10:23:00] <hlfw0rd> yea
[10:23:05] <duch_kazatel> hlfw0rd there's a done callback.
[10:23:07] <tw2113> imagine i have a div with 3 select inputs, using .siblings() should create an object of all 3
[10:23:25] <hlfw0rd> oh wow duch_kazatel
[10:23:35] <hlfw0rd> passing anon function after 1000 fixed it
[10:23:37] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 making less sense.  fiddle what you're trying to do?
[10:23:44] <duch_kazatel> hlfw0rd 1000 what?
[10:24:01] <tw2113> selects that is
[10:24:13] <hlfw0rd> duch_kazatel, hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000, function() { ...hide(); })
[10:24:29] <hlfw0rd> duch_kazatel, oops: hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 1000, function() { ...show(); })
[10:24:57] <hlfw0rd> is that just called a callback in javascript? I am used to calling the anonymous functions
[10:25:00] <duch_kazatel> hlfw0rd just use the complete callback.  if you're using the options object, pass the reference.
[10:25:12] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/hide/#hide-options
[10:25:20] <hlfw0rd> ok
[10:25:24] <duch_kazatel> a callback is any time you "call back" to a function from something else.
[10:25:29] <duch_kazatel> the callback can be anonymous
[10:25:33] <hlfw0rd> ah awesome
[10:25:45] <duch_kazatel> but look at the "complete" callback.
[10:25:57] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 you want to select the three selects under #foo?
[10:26:00] <hlfw0rd> I see, thanks
[10:26:34] <tw2113> i'm asking if .siblings() should be selecting all 3
[10:26:47] <duch_kazatel> $('#foo select') should, yes.
[10:29:33] <tw2113> hmm
[10:29:50] <tw2113> thanks. Trying to debug an addon for something, and not everything is hiding like we intend
[10:29:54] <tw2113> thus why i'm asking
[10:30:07] <bberry> if i want to use a javascript function (.some) on a jquery array, how do i do that?
[10:30:23] <bberry> i keep getting undefined is not a function (it thinks that .some is undefined for the jquery array)
[10:30:29] <bberry> http://jsfiddle.net/6FY4s/
[10:30:49] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 a fiddle might be helpful to demonstrate.
[10:31:01] <duch_kazatel> bberry what jquery method are you trying to run?
[10:31:08] <duch_kazatel> some?
[10:31:30] <bberry> yeah
[10:31:31] <tw2113> not sure it's going to be super easy to recreate, it's a bad UI technique where we keep changing visibility on a bunch of inputs, depending on the value of a primary input
[10:31:41] <decx> jqueryArr.get().some
[10:31:42] <bberry> duch_kazatel er no. its a javascript array function
[10:31:50] <duch_kazatel> bberry i was about to say.
[10:32:03] <bberry> its interesting that some isnt in the prototype chain
[10:32:04] <tw2113> it needs backboned :D
[10:32:05] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 can you set up a basic, simplified version?
[10:32:27] <bberry> unless jquery adds a property to the jquery array that is called 'some' and they dont define it
[10:32:34] <duch_kazatel> bberry let me poke.
[10:32:39] <bberry> please do :P
[10:32:59] <decx> am i invisible?
[10:33:05] <decx> you want .some? get().some
[10:33:12] <duch_kazatel> decx oh hah.
[10:33:24] <duch_kazatel> punny
[10:33:36] <tw2113> i'm going to beat on it myself a bit longer, and if i get absolutely nowhere, i'll probably return :D
[10:33:40] <tw2113> yes i'm stubborn
[10:33:48] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 okay, i'll do it for you then.
[10:34:10] <bberry> decx: yeah i could do that. looks kinda ugly tho :/
[10:34:12] <duch_kazatel> does the jquery object inherit from array?  i can't remember.
[10:34:20] <bberry> decx: alsol, lol.
[10:34:58] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 http://jsfiddle.net/9nCJu/
[10:35:09] <duch_kazatel> that's really all i was looking for.
[10:35:43] <decx> i don't know any other way bberry, but i used it successfully for sort() on jq objects
[10:35:53] <bberry> cool
[10:44:17] <MikeD_> if(evt.target === evt.delegateTarget){} else{ /* stuff here */ }  <-- i'm no fan of "NOT-something" logic, but should this be if( evt.target !== evt.delegateTarget){ /* stuff */ } ?
[10:48:16] <abailarri> anyone can help me? I don't understand how leaflet centers the image. I want to cover all div with the image http://jsfiddle.net/XTf7J/8/
[11:04:18] <GoSox> Can you appent to a <textarea>, or do you have to do $("textarea").val( $("textarea".val() + "appended text" );
[11:04:47] <duch_kazatel> that's how you do it.
[11:05:21] <GoSox> oh ok
[11:05:34] <GoSox> and, do insert a line break, do I just do "\n" ?
[11:06:00] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:06:02] <GoSox> cool
[11:06:03] <duch_kazatel> should be
[11:06:47] <duch_kazatel> though be careful, because not all browsers on all environments use \n
[11:14:55] <gnarf> duch_kazatel: well, \n will work to insert in all browsers, and I even think IE's use \n instead of \r\n
[11:16:58] <gnarf> GoSox: $("textarea").val( function( index, value ) { return value + "appended text"; });
[11:17:51] <richurd> hello, i am trying to make floated li's have equal height column work, but the last li is not grabbing the height :) http://jsfiddle.net/y84zZ/
[11:18:11] <nhulea> yo what up !
[11:23:58] <BillCriswell> Yooo
[11:24:17] <richurd> ?
[11:26:30] <zizzl> Hey guys is there a plugin that can tackle what this http://littlelines.com/ header image is doing on mobile (or thin window) it's zooming and panning around the image
[11:27:51] <richurd> is there really 808 people in this room
[11:27:57] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:28:06] <BillCriswell> It's nap time, though.
[11:28:19] <nhulea> fuck that I m not napping
[11:28:23] <nhulea> haha
[11:28:30] <BillCriswell> I wish I was napping.
[11:28:35] <BillCriswell> napping with a burrito.
[11:28:35] <richurd> wh
[11:28:36] <richurd> why
[11:28:49] <nhulea> did you guys see the hamster eating a burrito
[11:28:56] <BillCriswell> richurd: I am totally making up the nap time thing.
[11:29:15] <BillCriswell> richurd: Fo the equal height columns I'd probably just use display table cell.
[11:29:16] <duch_kazatel> burrito napping.

[11:29:40] <richurd> sorry i woke up a few
[11:29:49] <BillCriswell> That is the cutest little burrito.
[11:30:10] <nhulea> seriously everything should come in an optional burrito form
[11:30:15] <nhulea> haa
[11:30:30] <BillCriswell> richurd: http://jsbin.com/wabeliko/1/edit?html,css,output
[11:32:02] <nhulea> heres the video pretty epic http://youtu.be/JOCtdw9FG-s
[11:32:17] <nhulea> 6 mil views I would have figure alot more\
[11:32:41] <BillCriswell> The more I think about css the more it ignores me. I feel like a lot of things that should be easy take too much work.
[11:33:09] <nhulea> BillCriswell: like which part ?
[11:33:13] <BillCriswell> nhulea: This is as good as I was expecting.
[11:33:24] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Like three equal columns
[11:33:34] <nhulea> 33% 33% 33%
[11:33:38] <BillCriswell> I meant height wise.
[11:33:42] <duch_kazatel> l'il burrito eater.
[11:33:44] <nhulea> oh
[11:33:46] <zizzl> Anyone?
[11:34:31] <duch_kazatel> zizzl probably not a plugin?
[11:35:06] <BillCriswell> zizzl: Can do that pretty easy with just some CSS ( I think )
[11:35:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's just CSS.
[11:35:14] <duch_kazatel> animation: 20s linear 3s normal both 1 zoomIn;
[11:35:39] <alaing> evening ppl
[11:35:42] <nhulea> could there just be a container div that overides all ?
[11:35:42] <alaing> how you doing duch_kazatel
[11:35:47] <nhulea> BillCriswell: ^
[11:35:59] <duch_kazatel> br
[11:36:01] <duch_kazatel> brb
[11:36:41] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Not sure I'm following that.
[11:37:12] <BillCriswell> Back in the day we used to do fake columns with background images, is that what you mean?
[11:37:39] <nhulea> I guess if I have 3 divs and I wnated them to all be the same height I would wrap them around another div and give that div the height and let the other inherit it
[11:38:00] <nhulea> the wrapping div
[11:38:11] <nhulea> so the chilrdren would inherit
[11:38:43] <CrossDomain> Im trying to $.post crossdomain with credentials, but when setting these to true the $.post starts calling .fail
[11:38:54] <nhulea> I could be wrong about that though
[11:39:44] <BillCriswell> nhulea: Say you didn't know the height of that div though.
[11:39:57] <zizzl> duch_kazatel & BillCriswell it's doing something more, as you can see it's longer than 3 seconds
[11:40:13] <zizzl> oh 20s
[11:40:14] <zizzl> nvm haha
[11:40:35] <MikeD_> so remember that .data() discussion from this morning?  under what circumstance would .data('foo') be undefined but .attr('data-foo') be the expected string?
[11:40:38] <nhulea> Yeah your right I guess it like algebra at that point you solve for x
[11:43:51] <BillCriswell> Guess you could do something gross with absolute positioning but... ick.
[11:48:16] <duch_kazatel> back
[11:48:20] <duch_kazatel> too popular today
[11:48:53] <nhulea> oh hell yeah !
[11:53:12] <harleycodr> can anyone help me with getting jquery expander to work in my drupal 7 installation?
[11:53:54] <duch_kazatel> 247 matches across 29 files
[11:54:03] <duch_kazatel> this is not going to be a fun project.
[11:55:05] <duch_kazatel> harleycodr what specifically are you having trouble with?
[11:55:26] <ruka_PHP> hi guys anybody knows some good jquery tree diagram
[11:56:04] <harleycodr> duch I can't get it to configure at all
[11:56:21] <harleycodr> I have a field set up as the display is expander
[11:56:24] <harleycodr> but it doesn't behave like that at all
[11:56:42] <harleycodr> The format I have set as expander
[11:56:51] <duch_kazatel> harleycodr any console errors?
[11:56:53] <harleycodr> What I wnat to do is to click the topic title
[11:57:00] <harleycodr> oh that's a good point let me check
[11:57:18] <harleycodr> no
[11:57:27] <harleycodr> no errors in the console
[11:57:41] <duch_kazatel> can you fiddle up what you're doing?
[11:57:49] <harleycodr> IT's not that deep
[11:57:56] <harleycodr> I am in the Drupal API
[11:58:02] <harleycodr> so I'm not actually in the jQuery code at all
[11:58:11] <duch_kazatel> then you need to ask a drupal channel.
[11:58:23] <harleycodr> they told me to ask in this channel and I thought that was odd
[11:58:35] <harleycodr> okay back to square 1 then.  Nice to know this channel exists
[11:58:36] <draggie> run around, huh?
[11:58:44] <harleycodr> in fact I do have a jquery question while I'm here
[11:58:44] <duch_kazatel> not sure what "the Drupal API" is.
[11:58:47] <harleycodr> yeah but it's okay
[11:58:50] <harleycodr> the dashboard
[11:58:58] <harleycodr> I wrote a little ditty that is a menu planner
[11:59:05] <harleycodr> you drag recipe names over to each day
[11:59:15] <harleycodr> and it appends the list of ingredients to a shopping list
[11:59:21] <harleycodr> is it possible to sort that list ?
[11:59:32] <duch_kazatel> define "sort"
[11:59:38] <duch_kazatel> you mean drag and drop things?
[11:59:42] <harleycodr> maybe put each line of the ingredients in an array and sort them alphabetically?
[11:59:43] <harleycodr> yep
[11:59:49] <harleycodr> www.spacerock.com/menumanager.php
[12:00:05] <duch_kazatel> there's sortable in jqueryui, which may not be what you want if you don't have jqueryui installed.
[12:00:20] <harleycodr> if it would sort the ingredients alphabetically on the fly which would make a mroe efficient list
[12:00:24] <harleycodr> oh yeah sortable....
[12:00:33] <duch_kazatel> alphabetically != drag and drop.
[12:00:35] <harleycodr> I'llhave to noodle more with it
[12:00:48] <duch_kazatel> you could use an OL
[12:00:50] <harleycodr> That's on my playtime; this is work time
[12:00:52] <duch_kazatel> and append using an LI.
[12:00:58] <harleycodr> ah okay that makes sense
[12:01:00] <harleycodr> then sort them
[12:01:08] <duch_kazatel> OLs sort automatically.
[12:01:17] <harleycodr> oh yeah hence the name ORDERED list
[12:02:37] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[12:02:42] <harleycodr> I didn't know that would work like that
[12:02:52] <harleycodr> I need to have lunch too...swam 2500 yards this AM and I'm  ravenous
[12:08:44] <guzzlefry> is it possible to launch a jQuery UI dialog with arbitrary html?
[12:08:55] <alaing> yes
[12:09:03] <alaing> yes guzzlefry
[12:09:15] <guzzlefry> Trying $('<div>test</div>').dialog();, but no luck
[12:09:39] <guzzlefry> oh, that does work...
[12:09:43] <guzzlefry> something else is wrong then :)
[12:11:10] <alaing> guzzlefry: whats the error?
[12:12:17] <NoiseEee> guzzlefry: can't imagine that <div>test</div> up there is even in the DOM yet so...
[12:13:11] <guzzlefry> I forgot a closing quote. ;)
[12:15:14] <alaing> guzzlefry: lol
[12:29:24] <guzzlefry> http://bpaste.net/show/cGBf750fNELHQDphc1BY/
[12:29:41] <guzzlefry> I think dialog() is doing something odd with the element it's applied to. :P
[12:29:43] <guzzlefry> Any workaround?
[12:30:27] <duch_kazatel> onclick="$Core.getFriends({input: " :(
[12:31:01] <duch_kazatel> bind using .on(), not inline click hanlders.
[12:31:03] <duch_kazatel> *handlers
[12:31:45] <guzzlefry> hm
[12:33:30] <guzzlefry> $html = $('<a href="#"></a>').on('change', function() {blah; blah;}).dialog();  ?
[12:33:53] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[12:33:56] <duch_kazatel> bind to the parent.
[12:35:27] <djQuery> guzzlefry, didnt think an <a> changed
[12:35:36] <guzzlefry> err, click :P
[12:36:23] <guzzlefry> What would the parent be?
[12:36:39] <duch_kazatel> where is this content getting displayed?
[12:36:48] <djQuery> guzzlefry, wait till you have added it to the dom
[12:37:08] <tonymke> Anyone know of a plugin that can do something similar to WoWslider's "seven" transition effect on a set of divs, instead of just images? http://wowslider.com/css-gallery-galaxy-collage-demo.html
[12:37:09] <duch_kazatel> or use event delegation so you aren't conditionally binding handlers.
[12:38:32] <decx> good lord tonymke why why why why why
[12:38:34] <guzzlefry> I'm clearly missing some essential knowledge here...
[12:38:51] <tonymke> decx: Just following the requirements doc. it's awful, I know
[12:39:14] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry go check out the docs for .on()
[12:39:25] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry event delegation is absolutely awesome.
[12:40:09] <decx> you clone the element 30 times, offset the position and then animate all 30 elements with all their content separately, the performance will be amazing
[12:40:18] <djQuery> guzzlefry, var $linkUL =  $('#linkUL').on('click', 'a', function(e){e.preventDefault(); });
[12:40:25] <salt_> hello all, I hope someone can help me with a load order issue im having
[12:40:35] <salt_> https://gist.github.com/saltandbeer/57c2cb579b48644123d0
[12:40:56] <salt_> im running a twitter widget that adds an iframe to my page, and i dont want the iframe
[12:41:16] <salt_> so i have a script that hides the iframe and takes the information i want
[12:42:02] <salt_> so im wondering how I can get this to run after the tweet loads
[12:42:15] <duch_kazatel> salt_ why are you trying to do that?
[12:42:25] <decx> i german we call that: von hinten durch die brust ins auge. instead of trying to hide the iframe just use twitters api to display a tweet
[12:42:26] <djQuery> salt_, why not just find\write one that does it the way you want in the first place
[12:43:04] <salt_> i havent been able to find that
[12:43:22] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, I'm using fullpage.js, but when I scroll down it just jumps to the last slide without scrolling. Scrolling upwards works though. Anybody know the cause of this? http://dev.jiannmaurodesign.com/
[12:43:35] <guzzlefry> djQuery: So it's binding that function to the click event on all children of #linkUL that match 'a'?
[12:44:03] <salt_> twitter API has been ending me
[12:44:12] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry basically, yes.
[12:44:12] <djQuery> guzzlefry, sure, then no matter how many <a> you add to the ul it will work for all of them
[12:44:28] <krambiorix> how can i access xdata in success function: http://pastebin.com/FXgcyJjP
[12:44:32] <djQuery> guzzlefry, you could add an extra class identifier as well
[12:44:44] <guzzlefry> oh, it constantly binds to new elements?
[12:44:51] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry no.
[12:45:00] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry it binds a single listener for events that bubble up.
[12:45:29] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix you mean the data you sent to the server?
[12:45:31] <guzzlefry> okay, I think I get it...
[12:45:44] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry go read about event bubbling in javascript.
[12:45:52] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, nope
[12:46:06] <guzzlefry> will do, thanks
[12:46:32] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix xdata, in your example, is the data you're sending to the server.
[12:48:37] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, ow sorry, wrong paste.. I want to access a variable defined outside the success function
[12:48:56] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix could you send over a fiddle with the code then?
[12:49:04] <duch_kazatel> the variable must be defined in a parent scope.
[12:50:31] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/xXz65/
[12:52:21] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, ow, this ajax request is placed in the dialog buttons section
[12:52:30] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix huh?
[12:52:44] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix this doesn't liike like a complete example.
[12:53:09] <krambiorix> duch_kazatel, it isn't, but i got your point
[12:53:16] <duch_kazatel> cool.
[13:05:01] <DeltaHeavy>  Anybody know why scrolling down jumps to the last section, while scrolling upwards is working as expected? I'm using fullpage.js to remove the default behaviour of scrolling, so scrolling up/down should smoothly take you to a whole new section. Anybody know how I can fix scrolling downards? I think it's a CSS conflict but idk - http://dev.jiannmaurodesign.com/
[13:31:28] <CheshireCat> if i have a set of dom elements, how do i find the index of the one that has a particular child?
[13:33:00] <guzzlefry> okay, http://bpaste.net/show/TKOyMLKdUJqDNCYAD8VD/ what am I doing dumb?
[13:33:10] <duch_kazatel> CheshireCat let's flip that question - why?
[13:33:26] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry don't use return false;
[13:33:35] <CheshireCat> i have a bunch of LIs
[13:33:37] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry does .gift exist at the time of binding?
[13:33:38] <CheshireCat> one of them has a class
[13:33:44] <CheshireCat> and i need to add another class to it
[13:33:53] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: yes
[13:33:56] <CheshireCat> and there's tabs
[13:34:04] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry fiddle it maybe?
[13:34:06] <CheshireCat> so im trying to find the index of the tab
[13:34:27] <guzzlefry> err
[13:34:33] <djQuery> CheshireCat, $('#myUL').find('whatever').parent('li').index()
[13:34:49] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: Does #purchaseBox a need to exist at the time of binding?
[13:34:58] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry no.  .gift does.
[13:35:00] <CheshireCat> cool i'll try that
[13:35:04] <guzzlefry> ok
[13:35:04] <duch_kazatel> .gift should be the parent.
[13:35:14] <duch_kazatel> #purchaseBox a should both be children
[13:35:30] <duch_kazatel> CheshireCat .parent() or .parents() and then get the .index(), but if that's going ot be used to hide/show content, i'd consider rethinking your solution
[13:36:35] <guzzlefry> err wait, #purchaseBox a isn't handled as a single selector?
[13:36:51] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry that second arg is handled as one selector.
[13:37:45] <guzzlefry> ah okay, I got confused because you said 'both' should be children. :P
[13:37:45] <duch_kazatel> your html would have .gift, then under that #purchaseBox and then a.
[13:37:48] <duch_kazatel> right
[13:38:58] <guzzlefry> http://bpaste.net/show/9zw3qGWqp0BLM41vgM7b/ <--- is that broken?
[13:39:40] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry try making a fiddle.
[13:39:46] <guzzlefry> ok
[13:40:21] <duch_kazatel> and don't use return false; - if you want to prevent the default behavior of a click, pass the event object and run preventDefault() on it.
[13:43:00] <domx23> Hey guys I'm looking for a pretty specific plugin that I haven't been able to find but I'm almost positive it has to exist. I want to be able to zoom into an image and drag a box around a part of the image to get the coordinates which could later be used for cropping or something else, but I want to find the coordinates based on the original image size not the zoomed in coordinates. Does anyone know if something like this exists?
[13:44:04] <duch_kazatel> domx23 probably nothing like that.
[13:46:21] <domx23> Hmm there seems to be so many image croping plugins but they all crop based on the zoomed in cordinates...
[13:46:36] <duch_kazatel> domx23 right - your "zoom" requirement is the problem.
[13:46:42] <duch_kazatel> that's going to be purpose-built by you.
[13:47:30] <domx23> ok gotcha
[13:47:33] <doberman> detecting the zoom level is pita
[13:47:45] <duch_kazatel> wait do you mean browser zoom?
[13:47:59] <domx23> no
[13:48:02] <duch_kazatel> okay
[13:49:00] <domx23> basically this but with the original coordinates not the zoomed in coordinates http://www.cropzoom.com.ar/demo/
[13:49:48] <doberman> cannot open the website
[13:50:37] <duch_kazatel> domx23 what do you need it for?
[13:51:02] <NoiseEee> domx23: basically you need to use math.  100px from the top of a 800px images = X from the top of a 2000px image; solve for X
[13:51:17] <duch_kazatel> lol algebra
[13:52:15] <domx23> Ya just trying to be as precise as possible and trying to find out by amount the image has been scaled by in order to find the original coordinates
[13:52:24] <NoiseEee> domx23:
[13:52:45] <NoiseEee> domx23: you need to specificially be told / have access to the original (coordinates)
[13:54:32] <domx23> Ok thanks guys I'm going to continue looking into it and I guess I'll have to add my own functionality
[13:56:15] <guzzlefry> http://jsfiddle.net/SBqra/ There we go.
[13:56:28] <guzzlefry> So it pops up the dialog when you click the purchase link
[13:56:38] <chovy> is it possible to see which element caused a blur event?
[13:56:39] <guzzlefry> and then "Select Friends" should fire a console log message.
[13:56:51] <duch_kazatel> chovy event.target iirc.
[13:57:02] <chovy> duch_kazatel: i would assume that would be the item being blurred.
[13:57:10] <duch_kazatel> chovy wat
[13:57:19] <chovy> yeah, i want to know what caused it
[13:57:23] <duch_kazatel> define "blur"
[13:57:24] <chovy> like click on button or click on div
[13:57:30] <chovy> textarea.blur
[13:57:31] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[13:58:48] <Azrael_-> hi
[13:59:16] <Azrael_-> i'm using this test form but the first field doesn't validate, can you give me a hint why? http://jsbin.com/hepix/1/edit
[13:59:27] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry you're confusing after with append
[13:59:51] <duch_kazatel> wait maybe not one sec.
[14:00:17] <guzzlefry> .after was intentional
[14:00:34] <duch_kazatel> yeah your html isn't getting inserted within gift
[14:01:01] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/5Eu60YQ.png
[14:02:39] <guzzlefry> err
[14:02:55] <duch_kazatel> jquery ui does a lot of magic and funk, so that's part of your problem i'm guessing.
[14:03:38] <CheshireCat> if i have 1 element in a variable and i call .index() on it, will it find its index relative to all the elements that have that same selector?
[14:03:43] <duch_kazatel> do you just want to make a modal out of a string, guzzlefry?
[14:05:01] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry because one way to approach is by doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/SBqra/1/
[14:05:02] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: I'd need to attach the click event function onto an element of it.
[14:05:15] <duch_kazatel> but if you can bind down further into the document, please do.
[14:05:43] <duch_kazatel> CheshireCat not sure what you mean.  rephrase the question?
[14:06:04] <CheshireCat> theres 5 LI's and i did a selector to find the one i want
[14:06:15] <CheshireCat> can i use index to find its index within those 5?
[14:07:02] <duch_kazatel> is this for that navbar thing you were looking at doing?
[14:07:14] <CheshireCat> yeah i have 5 tabs and 5 divs
[14:07:31] <duch_kazatel> you should probably use a data attribute to link the two together instead.
[14:07:36] <duch_kazatel> so that the order doesn't matter.
[14:08:02] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:08:02] <CheshireCat> its in ASP.net and i didnt want to change the server side code
[14:08:35] <duch_kazatel> what you're building now is going to be a hack - build out the right solution.
[14:08:45] <CheshireCat> yeah its a hack
[14:11:29] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't settle for the hack ;)
[14:12:08] <CheshireCat> there's deadlines!
[14:12:23] <duch_kazatel> it will be faster if you change the asp side.
[14:12:35] <CheshireCat> yeah probably
[14:16:02] <MikeD_> deadlines :(  If you don't have time to do it correctly the first time, when will you have time to do it over?
[14:16:25] <CheshireCat> thats for the next guy!
[14:16:30] <duch_kazatel> i've found that at least 80% of the time, the right way is the faster way.
[14:17:21] <guzzlefry> The next guy will forever curse your name.
[14:17:26] <duch_kazatel> that too.
[14:17:39] <duch_kazatel> hell, at our place we outright reject code that does stuff like that.
[14:18:13] <CheshireCat> psst im probably the next guy
[14:18:19] <CheshireCat> sucks to be him
[14:18:24] <duch_kazatel> D:
[14:18:32] <CheshireCat> :)
[14:20:25] <CheshireCat> well i got it to work
[14:20:31] <CheshireCat> i guess it helped me learn some jQ
[14:25:36] <duch_kazatel> wtf is this mootools nonsense with $ and $$
[14:26:50] <guzzlefry> duch_kazatel: Thanks, things are working perfectly now.
[14:29:23] <Azrael_-> i'm using this test form but the first field doesn't validate, can you give me a hint why? http://jsbin.com/hepix/1/edit
[14:30:09] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- you mean the name field?
[14:31:39] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- which validation plugin are you using?
[14:38:19] <Azrael_-> duch_kazatel: in the example i'm using http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.12.0/additional-methods.min.js
[14:42:21] <fn> could anyone explain why i should do a function as a variable?
[14:42:35] <duch_kazatel> fn hrm?
[14:43:36] <duch_kazatel> Azrael_- i'm getting an error in the console.
[15:13:41] <nhulea> is it nap time yet?
[15:14:49] <duch_kazatel> yes
[15:14:51] <duch_kazatel> always
[15:22:01] <clov3r> hey, i'm looking for a little help from someone regarding multiple async callbacks to $.get
[15:22:18] <clov3r> ... that are contained within a .each loop
[15:22:39] <duch_kazatel> clov3r sounds like a job for promises.
[15:23:19] <guzzlefry> Trying to style the jQuery UI dialog, can't seem to get a few spots.
[15:24:19] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry sounds like a specificity problem.
[15:26:07] <clov3r> duch_kazatel hmmm... trying to figure out how to jsbin what i'm working with, when i'm $.getting cross domain resources...
[15:26:28] <clov3r> duch_kazatel but yes, it does sound like a job for promises
[15:27:07] <duch_kazatel> clov3r is each iteration of the each reliant on the last completing?
[15:27:07] <clov3r> http://jsbin.com/lativiyu/1/
[15:27:14] <clov3r> (doesn't work yet)
[15:27:50] <clov3r> basically for each of a certain element on the page, I scrape the href, make a proxied get request to the resource
[15:28:01] <clov3r> so there's a dynamic number of requests made
[15:28:13] <clov3r> implemented in a .each() loop
[15:28:32] <clov3r> after all the request return, i then need to embed all the returned content into the page
[15:29:13] <clov3r> but to answer your question... no
[15:29:23] <clov3r> each iteration is not reliant
[15:29:47] <clov3r> I just have a series of expressions that are dependent on ALL completing
[15:30:03] <clov3r> hopefully that makes sense
[15:30:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you need promises.
[15:30:45] <clov3r> where do I apply the promise?
[15:31:07] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[15:31:09] <duch_kazatel> start here.
[15:31:43] <duch_kazatel> and check out the docs for .when()
[15:32:21] <guzzlefry> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/70902 <-- Any ideas on getting rid of the white color? Tried using this: http://bpaste.net/show/RXtj8W2rtkpMIGHNH1BA/
[15:32:40] <duch_kazatel> guzzlefry need to see a working example.
[15:35:10] <clov3r> can i add deferred objects to a .when after it has been created?
[15:35:24] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:35:46] <duch_kazatel> did you read the docs for $.when() ?
[15:35:51] <clov3r> yep
[15:36:08] <clov3r> i can see how you can wrap .when around multiple ajax calls
[15:36:18] <clov3r> but when those ajax calls are generated inside a loop...
[15:36:56] <StephenS> how can I force a user to focusout?
[15:37:13] <duch_kazatel> also this: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/ clov3r
[15:37:28] <StephenS> when I hit ESC I call function which hides search box, which is fine, however if is focused in, box remain.
[15:40:08] <clov3r> duch_kazatel so that confirms a lot of what I knew about promises
[15:40:53] <clov3r> can you see where I am having trouble grokking my use case though?
[15:41:05] <clov3r> i can't wrap the .when or .promise around the .each loop
[15:41:14] <clov3r> because that returns almost immediately
[15:41:55] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/examples/#loading-images-in-a-panel-on-first-click-and-opening-said-panel :)
[15:42:15] <clov3r> ah sweetness
[15:42:24] <clov3r> you DID read my brain ;)
[15:42:30] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like that.
[15:42:38] <clov3r> haha
[15:42:40] <clov3r> yes it will
[15:42:46] <clov3r> thanks a bunch duch_kazatel
[15:44:21] <clov3r> ah, first time I've needed to use .apply
[15:44:29] <clov3r> super cool
[15:44:46] <clov3r> nerding out yo!
[15:44:53] <duch_kazatel> werddup!
[15:50:31] <StephenS> duch_kazatel:
[15:50:40] <StephenS> if (e.keyCode == 27) {		$(':focus').blur();		$('#livesearch').hide(); }
[15:50:47] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:50:50] <StephenS> Any idea why hide() part does not execute?
[15:50:57] <NCS_One> hi
[15:51:08] <duch_kazatel> probably does, StephenS.  have a fiddle?
[15:51:15] <NCS_One> what typeahead you recommend? been using twitter bootstrap typeahead but need one with more events
[15:51:33] <StephenS> It actually executes, but it only blinks, like hide ands then show again, because its blurred, but that blurred part does not focusout, so after I hit ESC for 2nd time, livesearch hides.
[15:51:35] <StephenS> dunno why.
[15:51:51] <duch_kazatel> StephenS sounds like you've got something else going on.
[15:52:03] <StephenS> yeah I use onkeyup
[15:52:04] <duch_kazatel> fiddle would be great.
[15:52:31] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: onkeyup="if (this.value.length >= 2) { showResult(this.value); }else {  $('#livesearch').hide(); }
[15:52:45] <StephenS> and that works fine, however problem is in showresult I guess.
[15:52:47] <duch_kazatel> that's not a fiddle.
[15:53:01] <duch_kazatel> and if that's in your html, there's your first problem.
[15:53:44] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:53:54] <guzzlefry> Is there some clever jquery code I can use to find out what's display either a white background or white border?
[15:58:06] <Crucials> guzzlefry: so you have a box, and you want to find out if it has a white border or a white background?
[15:58:19] <Crucials> and return true if either is true? or is it a choice between the two?
[15:58:45] <guzzlefry> I'm trying to style this: http://www.pasteall.org/pic/70902
[15:58:57] <guzzlefry> I can't for the life of me figure out what's causing the random white stripes.
[15:59:37] <StephenS> nvm I solved it duch_kazatel :)
[16:00:15] <Crucials> which white stripes guzzlefry?
[16:01:23] <guzzlefry> Crucials: The one near the top, and the two going about 3/4 the way down the side
[16:01:37] <Crucials> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=70902
[16:01:43] <Crucials> pretty sure they are just a part of the image
[16:02:15] <guzzlefry> err?
[16:02:26] <guzzlefry> That's a screenshot of the actual rendering.
[16:02:44] <Crucials> ah, i've been fooled
[16:02:51] <guzzlefry> sorry, should've specified
[16:02:56] <Crucials> I didn't realise you were using that website to upload the image :P
[16:04:43] <Crucials> you dont have a version of that online?
[16:06:27] <Crucials> its kinda hard to tell, its most likely just a css border from somewhere though
[16:07:04] * guzzlefry sighs.
[16:07:08] <guzzlefry> I should stop working when sleepy. :P
[16:07:38] <guzzlefry> This framework includes a jquery.css file that I should've checked first.
[16:09:08] <StephenS> hmm how is possible that "testing" is written in console when I never hit ESC: http://pastebin.com/razmAVKG
[16:09:24] <StephenS> its very weird, and when I hit ESC everything is fine (hidden and blurred).
[16:09:50] <StephenS> so while I type letters in searchbox, I get "testing" in console. which I should not.. since 27 is ESC char...??
[16:09:58] <StephenS> duch_kazatel: idea?
[16:14:39] <juboba> how can I create a dialog with no html?
[16:15:02] <juboba> I mean, create a dialog purely with js
[16:17:12] <juboba> I don't want to write the html skeleton for the dialog. I would like to specify the dimensions through javascript. Is this possible?
[16:18:27] <anom> Hey
[16:18:34] <anom> http://jsfiddle.net/N76XX/1/ anyway to have jquery read the  date as dd/mm/yyy instead of mm/dd/yyyy?
[16:20:58] <__joshua__> easiest way: split on '/', coerce to ints, and minus 1 from the month
[16:21:45] <__joshua__> also anom: its not jquery, just good ol javascript
[16:22:27] <anom> ah my bad
[16:24:42] <JamesG1990> any idea how I would get this to slide down slowly? http://hastebin.com/baqiwewara.js
[16:25:40] <JamesG1990> I need to add a speed parameter or function somewhere..
[16:26:23] <__joshua__> by slide to you mean display or scroll?
[16:27:00] <__joshua__> .show() can take a duration argument
[16:27:17] <__joshua__> and easying etc
[16:27:50] <EminenceHC> I am checking an input to see if it has a value or not. I am doing this by checking if the length is over 0. if (fullValue.length == 0)  This doesn't seem to be the best way to do it. What is?
[16:28:10] <duch_kazatel> if ($thing.val() !== '')
[16:28:21] <duch_kazatel> checking the length can be legitimate, too.
[16:29:22] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Ok, thanks
[16:29:54] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:30:02] <duch_kazatel> this has been a helluva day
[16:32:15] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: Does it work that way on a variable also? For instance: I was doing (fullValue.length == 0) and now I am trying: (fullValue.val() !== '') or (fullValue !== '') ?
[16:32:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:32:33] <duch_kazatel> depends on what fullvalue is
[16:32:47] <EminenceHC> duch_kazatel: fullValue = $this.find('.full').val();
[16:32:48] <duch_kazatel> is that the input, or the value of the input?
[16:32:55] <duch_kazatel> then (fullValue !== '')
[16:36:21] <JamesG1990> __joshua__ I am trying to get the dropdown effect like on wpengine.com (click the little search icon)....it pushes the whole page down...they way i have it, it just drops down :/
[16:36:40] <__joshua__> position:absolute
[16:36:50] <duch_kazatel> juboba you can do it in raw JS, sure.
[16:37:32] <duch_kazatel> juboba you can do raw dom manipulation using the API, but it's not always the best way.
[16:40:03] <__joshua__> JamesG1990: oh, you are block element, and you are pushing down, but you want an animation?
[16:40:13] <JamesG1990> yeah :(
[16:40:19] <__joshua__> slideDown()
[16:40:24] <JamesG1990> ohh
[16:40:26] <__joshua__> if i remember correctly
[16:40:30] <JamesG1990> thnx
[16:45:20] <JamesG1990> __joshua__ thanks it has been a long day, that was easy
[16:45:23] <JamesG1990> take care
[16:45:29] <__joshua__> good luck
[16:56:50] <dmorris____> How does a method call work against an array of objects in jquery?
[16:57:05] <__joshua__> elaborate
[16:57:21] <dmorris____> For example, $(".someclass").css("display") == "none"
[16:57:39] <__joshua__> it sets all matching elements
[16:57:42] <dmorris____> What is the condition where that returns true/false?
[16:57:44] <__joshua__> oh wait
[16:57:58] <__joshua__> in taht case, its the first, i believe
[16:58:01] <dmorris____> Yeah, setting I completely get.
[16:58:04] <__joshua__> for getters
[16:58:09] <dmorris____> ah.
[16:58:18] <__joshua__> will confirm, 5 seconds
[16:58:34] <__joshua__> yup
[16:58:56] <dmorris____> Is there a way to do logical checks like if any in the set is true, return true ---or--- if one in the set returns true, return true.  That kind of thing?
[16:59:28] <dmorris____> Or do I have to write my own each() function to check myself?  Just thought jquery might already have something embedded for that.
[16:59:35] <__joshua__> $(select).map(function(){ return $(this).test}).toArray().every()?
[17:00:02] <dmorris____> wow, hold on, I have to think thru this......
[17:00:03] <__joshua__> need an identity func in there
[17:00:37] <dmorris____> I followed up to .every()
[17:00:42] <dmorris____> Looking up the docs.....
[17:00:44] <jaapbadlands> I have a single page website with different sections representing pages, I'd like to add a class to the main menu (fixed position) depending on which section of the page is being viewed, how best to do this using jQuery?
[17:01:23] <__joshua__> $(select).map(function(){ return $(this).test}).toArray().every(function(e){ return e;});
[17:01:48] <__joshua__> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every
[17:02:02] <__joshua__> not great support for ie there
[17:02:18] <dmorris____> will this work in all browsers?
[17:02:29] <dmorris____> I did find it in msdn
[17:02:34] <__joshua__> maybe $(select).filter(function(){ return $(this).test}).length === $(select).length
[17:02:53] <dmorris____> What I really want is any, not every.
[17:03:10] <__joshua__> !!$(select).filter(function(){ return $(this).test}).length
[17:03:40] <dmorris____> Basically I have embedded <p> and if any parent is hidden, I need to hide the one I am working on.
[17:05:37] <__joshua__> if($(this).parents().filter(function(){ return !$(this).is(':visible');}).length){
[17:05:38] <dmorris____> $(myobject).parents().filter(function(){ return $j(this).css("display" == "none";}).length
[17:06:24] <dmorris____> or :visible, right got it.  OK, still needed a function but not where I set an external variable and then......
[17:06:34] <dmorris____> Perfect, thanks Joshua, good job.
[17:07:03] <dmorris____> This just became my favorite channel.  The guys in ##java are tough birds.  you guys are very accomodating.
[17:07:13] <duch_kazatel> we try to be.
[17:09:41] <dmorris____> Joshua, when you first responded, did you confirm that the default is to return the result by checking only the first entry?
[17:12:13] <__joshua__> yeah, for the first element in the set of matched elements
[17:12:30] <dmorris____> right, ok.  perfect.  Thanks for the help
[17:35:34] <rocky> is there a preferred jquery hashbang-management plugin these days? looked at jquery bbq but it's github repo says it was last updated 4 years ago
[17:35:52] <duch_kazatel> i handrolled my own a while ago.
[17:35:59] <duch_kazatel> history.js was popular for a while, not sure about now.
[17:40:04] <BillCriswell> rocky: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11427258/all-in-one-location-hashchange-history-management-library answers here look pretty useful.
[17:42:01] <rocky> BillCriswell, hm at least that's only 1 year old, so far my googling has only given me stuff that's like 4 years old
[17:42:21] <duch_kazatel> rocky it's not terribly hard to write your own imo.
[17:42:42] <rocky> duch_kazatel, it's not, but i'm tired of writing my own lol
[17:42:49] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[17:43:12] <duch_kazatel> i'm actually pretty happy with mine.  it's been kicking on our site now for around 8 months?
[17:43:29] <BillCriswell> rocky: If something is built well and things haven't changed in a while I don't see why you'd expect something newer.
[17:43:43] <BillCriswell> Know what I mean?
[17:43:51] <rocky> BillCriswell, because i automatically assume something that is > 3 years old won't work with jquery2 which is what i'm using
[17:45:02] <duch_kazatel> as long as they're not using any of the deprecated methods, you should be fine.
[17:45:06] <BillCriswell> You know what they say about assuming
[17:45:08] <duch_kazatel> not sure what the 2.x series has to do with it.
[17:46:54] <rocky> when i see a list of 20 hash plugins (i've actually probably found more) then my own experience shows that you're best bet for evaluating is going in order from recent to oldest when trying them out (this goes for anything, not just jquery)
[17:47:31] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/ - seems pretty recent
[17:48:13] <rainabba> Using $.ajax() via GET method with dataType: "json" and contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8", how I can send a complete object (stringified or otherwise) and be able to then retrieve it in the call? Right now the object is being interpreted somehow so that { opt: { q: "foo", l: 10 } } ends up as {"opt[q]":"camoa","opt[l]":"10"}   (two query params are passed as opt[q] and opt[l])
[17:49:27] <rocky> hm yeah History.js looks promising
[17:49:46] <duch_kazatel> rocky i wasn't a fan of it personally, but you might have more success.
[17:49:58] <rocky> duch_kazatel, any particular reason?
[17:50:10] <duch_kazatel> it had some bugs that were hard to work around.
[17:50:12] <dmorris____> OK, favorite chat room. Is there a selector to select all occurrences after a given number?
[17:50:15] <duch_kazatel> can't remember them specifically.
[17:50:37] <dmorris____> i.e., parent("everyone after the 2nd")
[17:51:04] <duch_kazatel> dmorris____ "after a given number" meaning...?  can you fiddle what you're trying to do?
[17:51:36] <BillCriswell> dmorris____: So like... all ancestors before your grandparents?
[17:51:51] <rainabba> dmorris____: With CSS there is :nth-child() so I imagine that jQuery has a similar implementation
[17:51:53] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[17:52:00] <dmorris____> I have never used fiddle.  basically I want .parents(".someclass") but want to exclude the closest one, I want all the rest, so grandparents and above.
[17:52:21] <BillCriswell> dmorris____: That's nothing like nth-child
[17:52:26] <dmorris____> right.
[17:52:39] <dmorris____> bill, right.
[17:53:30] <dmorris____> So like run the normal selector but then remove the first entry?
[17:53:53] <dmorris____> There is an add(), let me check if there is a remove() via index.
[17:54:42] <Foxhoundz> What's wrong with jQuery?
[17:54:44] <Foxhoundz> What's the big idea?
[17:54:49] <Foxhoundz> Deprecating the toggle() functionality?
[17:55:26] <dmorris____> yup, not will work.  Perfect.
[17:55:31] <dmorris____> oops, not()
[17:55:45] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: That's not deprecated.
[17:55:47] <rainabba> Couldn't do something like $('#foo').parents('.foobar').find('*:nth-child(n+1)') ?  If not that, you could map() the results of the parents() call then return a new array without the first item I think.
[17:57:45] <dmorris____> yup, that worked. obj.parents('.someclass').not(obj.closest('.someclass')) did it.
[17:58:16] <Foxhoundz> BillCriswell: yes itis
[17:58:27] <Foxhoundz> the original toggle method accepted two anonymous functions to toggle  a behavior
[17:58:31] <Foxhoundz> I need to make a custom toggle animation
[17:58:42] <Foxhoundz> the new toggle method on 1.8+ remove the signature
[17:58:49] <Foxhoundz> and simply implement their own hide animation
[17:58:58] <BillCriswell> Foxhoundz: Oh. I never touched the deprecated one.
[18:00:28] <BillCriswell> dmorris___: You can do $('.foo').parents('.foobar').slice(1)
[18:00:40] <BillCriswell> Oh, left.
[18:02:12] <beachandbytes> Anyone here good with knockout, trying to figure out why my update function is not getting called
[18:02:13] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/2ax5v/1/
[18:14:44] <jaapbadlands> the .next() method returns undefined if the next sibling doesn't match the selector given to it eg .next('section') returns undefined if the next sibling is a div. How do I get the next sibling that does match what I pass to .next() ? So if the next element is a div, it skips it and goes on to find the next section... ?
[18:15:58] <akim> is there a workaround for jquery to allow CORS when making AJAX calls?
[18:17:40] <systemfault> akim: There’s no way around it, fix your backend.
[18:18:03] <akim> okay, my backend returns Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[18:18:09] <akim> but jquery still seems unhappy by it :(
[18:18:42] <akim> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[18:18:48] <akim> i mean, that's in the response header :\
[18:19:02] <systemfault> What do you have in your console?
[18:19:15] <systemfault> Do you allow OPTIONS http calls?
[18:20:33] <akim> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.1.1:8080/rest/sample. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://192.168.1.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
[18:20:46] <akim> that's what i get in the console, im sure that i accept http calls
[18:22:55] <akim> yeah, i try to make an ajax call, and chrome cuts it off during request
[18:23:07] <akim> so i only see the provisional request headers and it gets cut off with the CORS error >_<
[19:05:30] <tonymke> Anyone have any experience getting some of jQueryUI's effect animations to work on items centered via negative margins?
[19:06:39] <shoky> akim: he was asking if you allow OPTIONS requests, responding with CORS headers to them
[19:07:05] <akim> shoky, im trying to verify that by writing my own filter :\
[19:07:17] <akim> in tomcat, im unable to upgrade to the version that has corsfilter built in
[19:08:24] <akim> thing is, i dont see the pre-flight OPTIONS request checking for cors
[19:08:29] <akim> at least chrome doesnt show that :\
[19:08:35] <shoky> show the ajax code and the request/response headers you see
[19:09:26] <akim> $.getJSON('http://192.168.1.1:8080/rest/sample', function(result) { console.log(result); }
[19:09:32] <akim> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://192.168.1.1:8080/rest/sample. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://192.168.1.1:8000' is therefore not allowed access.
[19:10:02] <akim> well, as for the request header, it's just provisional
[19:10:40] <shoky> you see the GET request?
[19:10:49] <akim> http://pastebin.com/JPmcawH5
[19:11:02] <akim> so this is my request, but the request header is just provisional
[19:11:30] <akim> Request URL:http://192.168.1.1:8080/rest/sample
[19:11:33] <akim> driving me nuts!
[19:11:34] <shoky> got server logs of this request?
[19:11:42] <akim> hmm, good point
[19:11:43] <akim> lemme check
[19:14:40] <shoky> and you got the corsfilter enabled on :8080  right
[19:15:01] <akim> yes :8080 is the tomcat
[19:15:08] <akim> server logs doesnt show anything meaningful
[19:16:30] <shoky> i dunno.. sounds like an issue with tomcat/corsfilter
[19:16:44] <akim> hmm, okay
[19:17:01] <shoky> with your usage/config of them, i mean
[19:17:50] <shoky> akim: if you just go to that url in your browser, what happens and what do you see in the network tab
[19:18:03] <shoky> http://192.168.1.1:8080/rest/sample  i mean
[19:18:23] <akim> i see the requested resource in the browser, and in network tab, the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * is part of the response header
[19:18:30] <akim> which is why im so puzzled
[19:18:41] <akim> the :8000 is hosted by nodejs server, that also has cors
[19:18:52] <akim> which is why i was thinking this was a jqeury ajax problem
[19:20:20] <aidan> Does anyone have a favourite table editor, e.g. http://handsontable.com/index.html
[19:20:42] <shoky> no idea, akim. there's nothing special you need to do with jquery/ajax to enable cors
[19:21:55] <akim> shoky, yeah ur right, i just tested with basic XHR
[19:21:57] <akim> hmmz
[19:22:06] <akim> all right, ill go need to scratch my noggin for a bit
[19:24:33] <shoky> akim: just realized you said its now working with your own filter
[19:24:48] <shoky> akim: wanna show the filter?
[19:25:20] <akim> no, it's not working with my own filter
[19:25:21] <akim> yeah, hang on
[19:25:41] <shoky> yeah i didnt mean working as in solved
[19:26:09] <akim> here's my hacky filter http://pastebin.com/E7J8GgRY
[19:26:32] <akim> i gotta say, this is madness
[19:27:22] <tw2113> no this is #jquery
[19:27:29] <tw2113> :D
[19:27:39] <akim> lol
[19:28:00] <shoky> akim try maybe logging something from your filter, to see if its even being used
[19:28:07] <akim> k
[19:28:11] <shoky> or breakpoint, whatever
[19:29:36] <ekcolysp> hey guys, is there a separate irc for jquery mobile, or i can pop the question in here?
[19:30:42] <jphaser> ekcolysp: you can ask questions here
[19:31:22] <akim> shoky, yeah, it's not even hitting my tomcat filter
[19:31:27] <akim> maybe it's hitting a different filter? hmm
[19:33:50] <Genitrust> hi all. when i go to my test page in the web browser, i see a flast of all of my div elements before the jquery hides them. this is kind of annoying, and definitely won't look professional :(
[19:34:02] <Genitrust> to prevent this from happening, i should hide the elements on document ready() , right?
[19:34:10] <Genitrust> err, i should *show* the elements on document ready(), right?
[19:35:03] <shoky> should they be visible or not
[19:35:47] <ekcolysp> thanks jphaser, i have a situation where there are many ways that our page got loaded, some are though data-ajax=false, some are actual ajax loads, so I was wondering if the pageinit event would capture both, or should i use pageshow?
[19:36:01] <ekcolysp> this is in an attempt to translate from document.ready
[19:36:35] <ekcolysp> read both events, but still a bit unsure
[19:37:12] <jphaser> ekcolysp: I'd use some console.log messages on pageshow and pageinit and check both ajax and non-ajax
[19:40:41] <ekcolysp> good suggestion, i'll do that, thanks jphaser
[19:41:04] <Genitrust> shoky, they should not be visible at all
[19:41:17] <Genitrust> yet, they "flash" visible (and then immediately invisible) when the page loads
[19:41:45] <shoky> Genitrust:  just put display:none on them in your css.
[19:49:48] <ekcolysp> hmmm, looks like it always trigger those 2 events, pageinit and pageshow
[19:50:09] <ekcolysp> i guess for my case, i can put the document.ready in either
[19:52:35] <Genitrust> shoky, even after "display:none;", i can do selection.show() to display it? ;x
[19:52:43] <Genitrust> i thought i ran into a problem with that... well i'll try :D
[19:52:43] <Genitrust> ty
[20:04:58] <akim> shoky, yeah ur right, it's a problem with my tomcat
[20:05:05] <akim> argh
[20:24:06] <unnu> <li class="portCat Additions"><a href="#">Additions</a></li>                 select the text out of the anchor using $('.portCat').click()

[22:22:50] <eip56> ANyone having issues with console.log()?
[22:23:11] <eip56> I can not for the life of me get it to work and im wondering if its the new firefox update
[22:23:32] <jphase> I don't use firefox personally but I know it works in aurora
[22:23:49] <jphase> should honestly work in every browser I know of shy of IE < 8
[22:24:08] <tw2113> i was using it earlier in aurora as well
[22:24:20] <eip56> Yea its something in the latest update.. I kind of answered my own question
[22:24:25] <eip56> i opened chrome and it works
[22:24:41] <eip56> the functions work just console.log is not.... i guess just good to know
[22:25:07] <chrisbolton> Evening. I need some help. I’m trying to change the text in the following gist (https://gist.github.com/Iknewthisguy/5daf06c3b92d00e98dae) replace “Follow” with “Following”, but it keeps breaking my icon.
[22:26:12] <tw2113> it's working in my copy of Firefox 29
[22:26:58] <tw2113> also found out that a page i was editing and trying to ditch jquery with is working again, which is an amusing find
[22:34:15] <jphase> chrisbolton: you either need to wrap you text in an element like a span tag or rebuild the contents of the element (including the icon)
[22:34:56] <jphase> s/you/your
[22:35:19] <chrisbolton> jphase: Thanks. I’ll give it a whirl. Do you know why that is?
[22:35:32] <jphase> chrisbolton: .text and .html replace the entire contents of the selector
[22:36:00] <chrisbolton> jphase: Thanks. That makes sense.
[22:36:11] <jphase> yay for foundation + font awesome btw ;)
[22:38:09] <chrisbolton> Yeah, not my styling, just trying to get around.
