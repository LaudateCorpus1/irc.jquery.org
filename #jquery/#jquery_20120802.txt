[00:00:04] <systemfault> HEMI: Looks good to me
[00:00:10] <HEMI> I learned a lot tonight.
[00:00:28] <HEMI> echo json_encode(array("name"=>"$shortFilename","loc"=>"$filename"));
[00:00:33] <HEMI> Aw yeah.
[00:00:49] <systemfault> :D
[00:01:04] <HEMI> I'd never done anything with json before, or ajax-type POST...
[00:04:24] <tw2113>  it's fun
[00:05:52] <HEMI> It's pretty neat.
[00:06:21] <coldhead> hey good work with all that, HEMI
[00:06:37] <HEMI> I guess this counts as a sixteen-hour work day for me...I got in to work at 10:00 am...Got off at 6:00...Ate dinner...Started working on this again. :|
[00:06:56] <HEMI> coldhead: thanks. It's probably nothing for the more-experienced folks in here, but it seems neat to me.
[00:07:14] <tw2113> sup coldhead-guy
[00:07:26] <tw2113> HEMI we're all new at some point
[00:07:44] <coldhead> it IS neat, that stuff is always neat
[00:08:05] <coldhead> and the more basic stuff you have under your belt the more interesting stuff #jQuery gets to help with
[00:08:19] <tw2113> the trick is to keep going and keep learning new things to reach that "neat" high
[00:08:21] <HEMI> The problem? I've been doing webtrash since about 1994...I started this job ages ago, and it's all old-school async php/JavaScript hand-offs/GET requests...
[00:08:31] <HEMI> So I haven't had to deal with this kind of thing before.
[00:08:50] <HEMI> Since I started writing new tools for the researchers here, I'm learning a ton.
[00:08:55] <coldhead> better late than  never
[00:09:06] <HEMI> ...And seeing how much of a steaming pile of crap the existing code I'm working with is. :)
[00:09:11] <tw2113> sounds fun
[00:09:26] <tw2113> i have a weird thing for taking old outdated stuff and making it new again
[00:09:31] <Whirl3d_> hold up. I thought this was colhead's second day of using the internets?
[00:09:43] <HEMI> My next problem is writing a tablesorter parser that will meet our researchers' needs...
[00:09:57] <tw2113> Whirl3d_ i thought coldhead's first day was tuesday
[00:10:06] <HEMI> tw2113: yeah, once this app is put to bed I have been given free reign to basically do whatever the hell I want.
[00:10:23] <tw2113> NEXT tuesday
[00:10:33] <Whirl3d_> makes sense about the NEXT tuesday thing....i see.
[00:10:54] <coldhead> THIS is my first day
[00:11:00] <coldhead> TODAY
[00:11:02] <coldhead> OF ALL DAYS
[00:11:07] <coldhead> THIS, HERE, NOW
[00:11:20] <HEMI> ...Speaking of which, any jquery tablesorter parser gurus around? :(
[00:11:45] <tw2113> $('#coldhead).on('breath', function(){ $(this).firstDay(); });
[00:11:53] <Whirl3d_> wow, that remimds me of this Oliver Sachs book I was reading recently about this London pianist that had a 5 second memory...His house was filled with notebooks where he had written: Okay, I am finally awake.
[00:11:57] <HEMI> haha
[00:12:03] <coldhead> hahaahha
[00:12:14] <Whirl3d_> it was so sad. After years and years, he nows is up to about 34 seconds
[00:12:44] <Whirl3d_> His wife left him (but came back) it's tragic. So remember that coldhead when you want out your body...5 seconds...
[00:13:33] <HEMI> Some day they're going to figure out how to bypass short-term memory and dump straight into long-term memory. IIRC, that's what the guy's problem is...Brain damage that doesn't allow stuff to be relocated from short-term to long-term memory.
[00:14:13] <Whirl3d_> Yeah. It's weird. He can play a piano concerto perfectly but can't remember starting it
[00:14:23] <blackspotwiggins> no short term memory is kinda scary tbh
[00:14:46] <HEMI> Oh, he's got short-term memory...Enough to function. It just doesn't make the jump.
[00:15:00] <coldhead> i can see how that would be good in a concero, terrible in jazz "oh i haven't soloed yet, better do that now!"
[00:15:00] <HEMI> Truly *no* short-term memory would be terrifying.
[00:15:11] <coldhead> concerto*
[00:15:18] <HEMI> haha
[00:16:34] <tcial> I have a new error in my code, that seems to have developed on it's own
[00:16:34] <tcial> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: >
[00:16:43] <Whirl3d_> I am surprised I have memory function at all, tbh.
[00:16:48] <coldhead> tcial: did you type >: | in your code?
[00:16:50] <tw2113> who are you all?
[00:16:54] <coldhead> that's a valid emoticon, invalid JS
[00:16:58] <tcial> coldhead: Not that I think
[00:17:02] <HEMI> haha
[00:17:16] <coldhead> i often type >: | in my code but i always do it inside a comment
[00:17:17] <tw2113> where am i?
[00:17:17] <tcial> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/5vJwF/
[00:17:21] <tcial> >:|
[00:17:23] <tcial> :P
[00:17:26] <coldhead> exactly
[00:17:34] <tcial> coldhead: That's my code
[00:17:39] <coldhead> find("<b>")
[00:17:39] <HEMI> coldhead: I'm glad I'm not the only one that puts expressive stuff in comments.
[00:17:42] <ravenzz> is it possible to get a reference of the last selected element on change?
[00:17:43] <coldhead> should be .find('b')
[00:17:57] <HEMI> ...Or in code blocks you should technically never reach...
[00:18:17] <coldhead> HEMI: i love my old comments, they make me not mind digging into old stuff
[00:18:21] <initself> $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "")).children("td:nth-child(" + columnIndex + ")")  # Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: td:nth-child
[00:18:21] <HEMI> I'll never forget my boss calling me on vacation and going, "what does 'FU MySQL, FU.' mean?"
[00:18:26] <coldhead> i used to be very funny, apparently
[00:18:38] <tw2113> lols
[00:18:38] <HEMI> "Oh, hell, I didn't think it would ever hit that block..."
[00:18:46] <initself> only happens when i have a <tr> that doesn't have any data?
[00:18:50] <initself> or <td>?
[00:19:31] <Whirl3d_> initself, try .filter()
[00:19:38] <initself> Whirl3d_: i can't even understand what the fail is
[00:20:03] <Whirl3d_> It's kind of a weird selector for children
[00:20:05] <initself> it'll complain about td:nth-child if there's no data in the <td>?
[00:20:20] <initself> Whirl3d_: so just swap .children with .filter?
[00:20:38] <Whirl3d_> td:nth-child requires that td has children, doesn't it
[00:20:47] <initself> what is a child?
[00:20:50] <initself> would that be data?
[00:21:21] <initself> the text in the td is td's child?
[00:21:31] <Whirl3d_> <td><p>hello</p><p>hi</p></td>    that td has two children, both are p elements
[00:22:00] <Whirl3d_> possibly yes. When you start talking about text in cells, I get a little fuzzy.
[00:22:13] <initself> <td>hello</td> hrm
[00:22:27] <Whirl3d_> not sure if .text() and .children() are somewhat equiv. or not
[00:22:34] <Whirl3d_> in that case
[00:22:49] <manster> i'm trying to use a switch case to style my page after it has been loaded, should it work for strings or is it only integers? http://jordanstabile.webu.us/about
[00:22:50] <ch3mical> I don't think text is considered a child?
[00:22:51] <Whirl3d_> and bot-t is dead. (r.i.p.)
[00:22:52] <ravenzz> uhm
[00:22:52] <manster> heres my code http://pastie.org/4376304
[00:22:55] <initself> well i need some kind of exception that says, if there's no child, pretend it's zero?
[00:22:59] <ch3mical> Has to be an element doesn't it?
[00:23:19] <Whirl3d_> ch3mical, not sure. But hey there. haven't seen you in a long while.
[00:23:29] <ch3mical> Whirl3d_: yeah, how are ya? :)
[00:23:43] <Whirl3d_> pretty good all things considered, you?
[00:23:49] <ch3mical> Good
[00:23:51] <initself> ch3mical: it fails if there's nothing inside the <td>, and works if there is some text in the <td>
[00:23:56] <ch3mical> Been playing with Enyo a lot lately
[00:23:58] <slartsa> $(document).ready(function(){ $(".lowermenu a").click(function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $('#shop_articles').load(this.href); return false; }); }); someone please tell me why clicking a .lowermenu a link this would load content into #shop_articles AND .lowermenu a?
[00:24:28] <ch3mical> initself: I could be wrong
[00:24:29] <manster> um never mind, i'm a silly panda
[00:24:41] <initself> same error with .filter, too
[00:24:46] <Whirl3d_> initself, I think that the problem is that your selector acts like a jquery object, but isn't.
[00:25:03] <ch3mical> slartsa: try '.lowermenu > a'
[00:25:30] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/Njqts/ obviously I need to subtract the old selected amount before to sum the new one
[00:25:35] <Whirl3d_> if you want the column based on column index, try .eq()
[00:26:02] <Whirl3d_> td.eq(columnIndex) should work
[00:26:02] <ravenzz> how can I get a reference to the previous selected value
[00:26:03] <ravenzz> ?
[00:26:23] <tw2113> assign it to a variable for safe keeping and then reference the variable?
[00:26:24] <slartsa> ch3mical: nope, that made things worse :)
[00:26:54] <ch3mical> slartsa: haha alright then. Sorry about that
[00:26:58] <slartsa> I'm pretty close to start using iframe
[00:27:07] <ch3mical> slartsa: maybe put up an example in jsFiddle?
[00:27:20] <slartsa> ch3mical: http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/5/
[00:27:23] <manster> weit no my swtichstatement still isnt working, shouldnt it work for strings?
[00:27:27] <slartsa> that's pretty much how it is now
[00:27:31] <ch3mical> Whirl3d_: have you played with Enyo at all?
[00:27:55] <slartsa> of course it wouldn't work in jsfiddle since it won't load from another server
[00:28:19] <ch3mical> slartsa: yeah I just want to see how it's setup I guess
[00:28:21] <initself> how do i put these two together?
[00:28:21] <initself> $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : ""))
[00:28:22] <ravenzz> tw2113 well, I was wondering if any member/property if the object has this informations
[00:28:23] <Whirl3d_> slartsa works for me
[00:28:26] <initself> td.eq(columnIndex)
[00:28:32] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/EVtKA/6/
[00:29:28] <Whirl3d_> initself, can you say in english what you want the selector to do
[00:29:52] <slartsa> Whirl3d_: it does load the content to #shop_articles, but it also loads the same in .lowermenu
[00:30:40] <tw2113> i can't get those fiddles to do anything
[00:30:44] <slartsa> Whirl3d_: it should load content only into #shop_articles
[00:31:52] <subhojit777> Does it requires time to create html elements dynamically, because I have realized that the more html elements I am creating the rendering of those elements is becoming slower.
[00:32:39] <tw2113> yes, it takes time to execute code
[00:32:59] <tw2113> including creating dom elements
[00:33:03] <initself> Whirl3d_: select all cells in a given column
[00:33:05] <initself> i think
[00:33:11] <Whirl3d_> slartsa, don't know how to help you. It doesn't appear to do that because of same-origin errors, so I'm not really sure how to duplicate the error
[00:33:23] <initself> $(".tablesorter tr:gt(0)").td.eq(3))
[00:33:26] <initself> ?
[00:33:32] <Whirl3d_> $("td").eq(3)
[00:33:37] <initself> which would be the 4th column, i guess?
[00:33:44] <Whirl3d_> I think so
[00:33:53] <ch3mical> subhojit777: solution: create the dom elements and store them as a variable and then write to the dom ONCE
[00:34:02] <ch3mical> subhojit777: modifying the dom is expensive
[00:34:34] <subhojit777> ch3mical: expensive in what terms?
[00:34:53] <ch3mical> Memory/processing
[00:35:02] <ch3mical> Also known as "slow yours shit down"
[00:35:15] <initself> i do not understand
[00:35:16] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/MXSwh/
[00:35:29] <initself> Whirl3d_: can you remove my retardation
[00:35:30] <initself> ?
[00:35:32] <ch3mical> subhojit777: try this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/DocumentFragment
[00:36:21] <ch3mical> subhojit777: Your app will run smooth if you implement it this way :)
[00:36:59] <initself> $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "") + " td").eq(columnIndex)  ?
[00:37:41] <initself> no syntax error with that, but nothing totals at all
[00:38:13] <ch3mical> initself: you might try $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "")).find('td:eq(3)')
[00:38:47] <subhojit777> ch3mical: ok thanks I will try this. I was using jQuery append() to create DOM elements.
[00:38:50] <ch3mical> initself: or $("." + tableClass + " tr" + (hasHeader ? ":gt(0)" : "")).find('td').eq(columnIdx)
[00:39:28] <initself> ok, i tried that - no syntax error, but no totals
[00:39:45] <ch3mical> subhojit777: That's fine to do that, just don't append them all separately. Combine them into as few writes (appends) to the DOM as possible to minimize overhead
[00:39:47] <initself> could it be that eq(columnIndex) doesn't do what I think it should?
[00:40:17] <ch3mical> subhojit777: just make "write to DOM as few times as possible" your new best practice :)
[00:40:38] <manster> you nappy headed hos
[00:40:44] <manster> goodnight
[00:41:18] <subhojit777> ch3mical: ok I got that.. so that means append() in jQuery and appendChild in JavaScript are same
[00:41:31] <initself> nothing runs in .each
[00:41:44] <ch3mical> subhojit777: essentially
[00:41:45] <initself> so i imagine that means the selector isn't finding anything
[00:42:03] <subhojit777> ok..
[00:45:20] <ch3mical> subhojit777: here's a better link: https://developer-new.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.createDocumentFragment
[00:45:42] <tw2113> ?appendChild
[00:45:52] <tw2113> no bot?
[00:46:25] <tcial> Whirl3d_: Do you remember the code you gave me yesterday? It didnt function correctly
[00:46:33] <tcial> It didn't show the currently active page
[00:46:36] <tw2113> ah, it's basically jQuery's append()
[00:46:42] <ch3mical> tw2113: no
[00:47:01] <ch3mical> (bot)
[00:47:31] <subhojit777> ch3mical: :) thank you
[00:47:39] <ch3mical> np
[00:48:20] <subhojit777> the last link is really good
[00:48:31] <initself> this is the strangest thing
[00:49:59] <mazzachre> I know this is bad from a user experience point of view, but it is the task I have been given... http://jsfiddle.net/A3hSJ/ How to make this work in IE? Is it possible?
[00:50:33] <amirite> mazzachre who cares about user experience
[00:50:48] <amirite> just churn out dirt
[00:51:12] <mazzachre> amirite: Hmmm... :)
[00:52:17] <ch3mical> Worms eat dirt
[00:53:19] <Whirl3d_> tcial, I have no idea. Do you have a fiddle?
[00:53:33] <tcial> http://jsfiddle.net/5vJwF/
[00:53:49] <mazzachre> Anyway, can it be done in IE? Currently it fails on "single"
[00:54:27] <Whirl3d_> tcial, I need some html to look at it.
[00:54:40] <Whirl3d_> other than the .find("<b>") thing
[00:55:00] <tcial> The find b should be a
[00:55:18] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5vJwF/1/
[00:55:41] <Whirl3d_> although I am not sure that b is an element. LOL
[00:55:44] <Whirl3d_> is it?
[00:56:04] <ch3mical> Whirl3d_: what's your github username?
[00:56:11] <ch3mical> Whirl3d_: <b>? Yes
[00:56:21] <Whirl3d_> It would be much simpler if it didn't need to be a bold ! and rather could be just added to the anchor text
[00:56:26] <Whirl3d_> same
[00:56:30] <Whirl3d_> Whirl3d
[00:57:17] <tcial> Whirl3d_: http://jsfiddle.net/5vJwF/2/
[00:57:35] <tw2113> why not just use css for the bold text?
[00:57:39] <tcial> I want it so that the one with the class active already has an exclamation mark, and doesn't get one added
[00:58:05] <tcial> Also, I don't want the ! in bold anymore, but IDK how to fix that
[00:58:14] <Whirl3d_> tcial, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5vJwF/5/
[00:58:34] <tcial> That's really not what I want
[00:58:53] <tcial> The only reason it has the class active, is so that jQuery can tell that's the page it's on
[00:58:59] <tcial> Not for styling
[00:59:18] <tcial> http://jackwilsdon.tk/js/default.js
[00:59:24] <tcial> That is the code I had before
[00:59:56] <tcial> As you can see, it only checks if it has the class 'active', if it does, it automatically appends ! to it, and the hover doesn't do anything
[01:00:53] <tw2113> here's a good question for those who know js more than me. With passing in events into functions, usually "e" or "el", do those NEED to be used, or can I use something else to represent the event in the function?
[01:01:09] <Whirl3d_> tcial, there's a css only solution for this
[01:01:23] <tcial> I'd rather stick with jQuery
[01:01:31] <ch3mical> -_-
[01:01:37] <tcial> :/
[01:02:07] <ch3mical> It's fine to be really into jQuery, but you should always use the best tool for the job
[01:02:37] <ch3mical> You wouldn't use a screwdriver to bang a nail just because it's your favorite screwdriver...
[01:02:47] * tw2113 would
[01:02:49] <tcial> :P
[01:03:00] * tcial would use the handle of the screwdriver ;)
[01:03:10] <ch3mical> Unless you're tw2113, of course
[01:03:20] <tw2113> however, i'd have to be careful to not break the glass and spill my oj+vodka
[01:03:51] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5vJwF/9/
[01:04:18] <Whirl3d_> Real simple
[01:04:30] <Bartzy> Hi everyone - I have a design question if anyone can answer: pinterest.com and chill.com are both generating HTML on the server side when loading more "pins". Why they are not sending the data as JSON and allowing JS to generate the pins HTML ?
[01:04:32] * ch3mical slow clap
[01:05:08] <tw2113> because they'd rather have the server do it?
[01:05:10] <Whirl3d_> tw2113, you could use anything you want
[01:05:41] <tw2113> i'm guessing e and el are just common practice variables that everyone tends to stick to
[01:05:44] <Bartzy> tw2113: But why, because JS would be too slow at concatenating all the pins HTML together, or ..?
[01:05:48] <Whirl3d_> $("el").click(function(vodka) {vodka.preventDefault();})   is that what you are asking?
[01:05:51] <blackspotwiggins> Bartzy, they might use data on serverside they dont want to send down the wire
[01:05:56] <blackspotwiggins> and it's simpler tbh
[01:06:02] <ch3mical> tw2113: el is the spanish version
[01:06:07] <ch3mical> el variable
[01:06:29] <tw2113> would be a good one Whirl3d_
[01:06:37] <tw2113> but, i had to ask
[01:07:33] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Fine, so do some data crunching on the server side and return as JSON only the stuff you need to for creating the view
[01:08:05] <ch3mical> Bartzy: but then you still have to generate the HTML on the client side if you do it that way
[01:08:39] <Bartzy> ch3mical: Right. Why not ?
[01:08:51] <blackspotwiggins> Bartzy, if you dont have to do shit in JS, just add html, it surely is faster?
[01:08:53] <tw2113> i'd like to believe they have their reasons
[01:09:04] <ch3mical> Bartzy: maybe they don't want to put too much work on the client?
[01:09:31] <blackspotwiggins> it's easier if you only maintain one template than two
[01:09:51] <Bartzy> So client will be slower than server in these kind of stuff ?
[01:09:51] <ch3mical> Maybe they don't have JS wizards, just PHP magicians?
[01:09:51] <blackspotwiggins> if you dont like slow as balls loading with only AJAX SUPER MAGIC, you need html rendered on server
[01:10:05] <blackspotwiggins> twitter tried with only clientside templating
[01:10:07] <blackspotwiggins> they failed
[01:10:10] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Can you explain , why ?
[01:10:21] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: That's exactly my question ! why not do it client side
[01:10:27] <ch3mical> Bartzy: not necessarily, depends on your server or what you're doing
[01:10:32] <blackspotwiggins> because it is slow
[01:11:08] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Why, what is slow ? The JS engines themselves ?
[01:11:12] <Bartzy> besides chrome :P
[01:11:29] <tw2113> maybe they don't want to deal with IE's shit
[01:11:35] <tw2113> so they just do it all on server side
[01:11:43] <Whirl3d_> tw2113 are you gassy again or do I smell a troll?
[01:11:58] <blackspotwiggins> Bartzy, it is slow when you load an empty page, have to do a second request to get the data
[01:12:02] <tw2113> *burps* i'm good again
[01:12:07] <blackspotwiggins> instead of getting a html page in the first place
[01:12:19] <ch3mical> It could be as simple as the server will consistently produce an expected result, whereas on the client there are many variables to account for...browser versions, client machine specs, etc etc
[01:12:32] <ch3mical> Maybe they just don't want to deal with having to make it work in IE? ;)
[01:12:32] <blackspotwiggins> and even if js is super fast, it is ALWAYS faster to send plain html
[01:12:34] <Whirl3d_> not to mention the number of clients required to develop special code for....blech
[01:13:04] <tw2113> jQuery all the sites!
[01:13:08] <blackspotwiggins> so, if they want to be super cool and edgy to use js templating, they'd have to maintain both templates
[01:13:16] <blackspotwiggins> but they choose to just use plain html
[01:13:24] <ch3mical> tw2113: just realized I said the same thing you just said :)
[01:13:54] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Why 2 templates, just JS if they choose JS.
[01:13:55] <tw2113> i'm just psychic, read your mind
[01:14:10] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Also - why do a second request - just send some JSON down the wire on the first request with CSS, JS and layout.
[01:14:59] <ch3mical> ;)
[01:15:04] <Tobsn> with .post().error(); can i somehow trigger error() from within the success callback of .post?
[01:15:32] <ch3mical> Tobsn: wtf? why?
[01:15:39] <blackspotwiggins> Bartzy, i just gave you a good reason why they would not want to use pure js, there may well be others
[01:15:57] <ch3mical> blackspotwiggins: BUT WHYYYYY??
[01:16:07] <Bartzy> blackspotwiggins: Thanks for the twitter tip - I'm now reading this - http://openmymind.net/2012/5/30/Client-Side-vs-Server-Side-Rendering/
[01:16:09] <Bartzy> interesting
[01:16:10] <Tobsn> on error i execute a method and if data comes back but isnt correct i'd like to trigger error as well
[01:16:40] <ch3mical> Tobsn: put the on error code in a function, call the function from both places
[01:16:53] <Tobsn> so no way to trigger error?
[01:17:06] <Tobsn> im kinda more curious about it then anything else
[01:17:18] <ch3mical> I think not
[01:19:00] <ch3mical> time to call it a night...
[01:26:44] <Whirl3d_> gnite ch3mical
[01:27:01] <Whirl3d_> actually, gnite all.
[01:28:29] <EnginA> can we assign/override a method per element ? i.e. $(foo).newMethod = x;
[01:28:56] <EnginA> or we need a common dispatcher method that'd call the necessary method according to some data stored on the element
[01:29:53] <letweet> hmmm can anyone help me figure out how to add content to my lightbox image details?
[01:30:20] <letweet> I'm using v0.5 0.o
[01:31:20] <slartsa> "use jquery" they said. "it'd be much fun" they said. now I have a shopping cart in a webstore that breaks .load(this.href); (dynamic requests for content from source outside from the page itself)
[01:31:54] <letweet> lol
[01:32:37] <slartsa> it'd be ok if the shopping cart was prototype or mootools but it's jquery as well
[01:32:47] <blackspotwiggins> slartsa, it's obviously jquery's fault
[01:33:13] <faraway> it's never the fault of the one how uses it :D
[01:33:21] <slartsa> blackspotwiggins: sarcasm over the internet <3
[01:33:51] <slartsa> I know it's not jquery's fault but the guy who created this shopping cart using jquery
[01:34:21] <blackspotwiggins> he also used a computer, and his hands
[01:34:24] <blackspotwiggins> CUT OFF HIS HANDS
[01:34:37] <faraway> ^^
[01:34:49] <slartsa> blackspotwiggins: that should be done
[01:34:57] <seutje> lolwat
[01:35:17] <slartsa> :D
[01:35:27] <blackspotwiggins> but srsly, add ext.js
[01:35:35] <blackspotwiggins> that shit fixes everything
[01:35:45] <blackspotwiggins> what's better than 3 js libs? 4 libs!
[01:35:57] <blackspotwiggins> or go all drupal and add jquery 1.2.6
[01:36:26] <slartsa> goes a bit heavy on js
[01:36:36] <seutje> http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update/
[01:37:58] <blackspotwiggins> lol seutje
[01:38:03] <blackspotwiggins> what's the original jq version on drupal 5 ?
[01:38:14] <seutje> I don't even know, D5 isn't supported anymore
[01:39:39] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: 1.1.2
[01:40:23] <blackspotwiggins> lol
[01:40:38] <blackspotwiggins> that seems like masochism
[01:40:44] <seutje> good times, man
[01:40:55] <seutje> "what do you mean, no method called closest?"
[01:43:00] <seutje> blackspotwiggins: also, if you update jQuery in D5 to a version beyond 1.2.6, half of your backend interface will break :D
[01:43:50] <blackspotwiggins> ^^
[01:45:38] <Kingsy> how would you guys begin to find if the bug if you just get errors like this --> TypeError: jQuery("#tabs").tabs is not a function <-- all js files are included in the head and jquery IS setup in noConflict.. so I assume an error is causing this
[01:46:38] <Kingsy> but its just impossible to find the error.. if you have loads of js files everything
[01:46:41] <Kingsy> everywhere
[01:49:57] <seutje> Kingsy: iono, figure what type it is, if it isn't a function
[01:50:23] <Kingsy> seutje: it is a function
[01:50:46] <Kingsy> for example below that I get TypeError: jQuery("#sliderMain").anythingSlider is not a function    <-- anythingslider IS a function
[01:52:03] <seutje> I guess it's lying then
[01:52:04] <blackspotwiggins> Kingsy, your plugins are not loaded
[01:52:07] <timing> Kingsy: maybe disable a lot of js files, and enable them one by one?
[01:52:18] <Kingsy> timing: yeah... could be a plan
[01:52:32] <seutje> my guess would be that you're running this before jquery UI was parsed
[01:52:32] <blackspotwiggins> try without noconflict
[01:52:36] <timing> does jQuery('#sliderMain').html(); work?
[01:52:41] <timing> that's a function as well
[01:53:02] <timing> seutje has a good point
[01:53:45] <seutje> if you then check via the console, after load and stuff, it will be a function and will work fine
[01:53:45] <Kingsy> blackspotwiggins: the plugins are loaded.. well at least the relevent js files are in the head
[01:54:24] <seutje> put a breakpoint before you're call and log $.fn.tabs
[01:54:30] <seutje> or jQuery.fn.tabs, w/e
[01:54:30] <Kingsy> seutje: yes that jquery call works in the console
[01:55:03] <seutje> there's an "is" missing in my sentence somewhere :/
[01:55:13] <seutje> no wait, I'm retarded
[01:55:17] <blackspotwiggins> no seutje YOU ARE CALL
[01:55:21] * seutje gets more coffee
[01:55:33] <seutje> yeah, knew something was off
[01:55:48] <Kingsy> hmm no.. after load if you type jQuery("#sliderMain").anythingSlider(); into the console it still says TypeError: jQuery("#sliderMain").anythingSlider is not a function
[01:55:48] <seutje> forgic, i mak english nat soe gut
[01:56:06] <blackspotwiggins> Kingsy, if a file is downloaded, is it also parsed?
[01:56:19] <seutje> we getting philosophical now? :P
[01:56:23] <blackspotwiggins> them being in head, or anywhere else means nothing
[01:56:46] <blackspotwiggins> maybe you are running your awesome js before the plugins are loaded
[01:56:47] <Kingsy> well I assume they are not being parsed... but why ?
[01:56:56] <seutje> if a file is parsed in an empty document, does it render?
[01:57:00] <timing> Kingsy: when do you call that code? in document.ready? window.onload?
[01:57:28] <blackspotwiggins> seutje, were you here when some guy was discussing if js variables are pemanent or temporary?
[01:57:28] <Kingsy> timing: inside a jQuery(function(){
[01:57:35] <blackspotwiggins> that was interesting :D
[01:57:35] <seutje> lolwat?
[01:57:41] <seutje> what does that even mean?
[01:58:02] <blackspotwiggins> he argued that if you do var a = "b", it doesnt really exist
[01:58:06] <blackspotwiggins> because when you reload, it is gone
[01:58:09] <blackspotwiggins> onoes
[01:58:21] <seutje> no1 coined localstorage? :P
[01:58:30] <blackspotwiggins> he was full of it anyway
[01:58:34] <seutje> Kingsy: yeah, that's a doc rdy
[01:58:42] <timing> Kingsy: is the code somwehre live?
[01:59:01] <seutje> that should wait until it's all parsed
[01:59:19] <seutje> you didn't miss-type the path to your jQuery UI, did you?
[01:59:28] <seutje> like, it's not 404ing or some shit like that, right?
[01:59:40] <faraway> Kingsy: "just an error like this" i mean it clearly says that .tabs is missing, so you need to know which plugin should provide tabs (i would guess jquery-ui) and then you need to look if this is really loaded
[01:59:41] <Kingsy> seutje: even with the code inside a jQuery(document).ready(function() {  you still get a is not a function
[01:59:59] <seutje> makes sense, it's exactly the same thing
[02:00:12] <Kingsy> faraway: I can see tabs.js in the head.. and it contains the code
[02:00:13] <faraway> sorry . lost connection … so i didn't see what/that something was written
[02:00:21] <blackspotwiggins> Kingsy, url of the page
[02:00:22] <blackspotwiggins> nao
[02:00:33] <Kingsy> blackspotwiggins: I cant .. its local :S
[02:00:40] <seutje> fiddle that shiiiii-
[02:01:05] <seutje> Kingsy: blind debugging is hard :(
[02:01:37] <Kingsy> yeah.. :S
[02:03:09] <faraway> Kingsy: if you comment out $(….).tabs so that no error occurs anymore you could check in console if the function was added some times later . call this console.dir(jQuery.fn); and check if tabs is in there then
[02:04:25] <faraway> Kingsy: but probably the plugin is buggy and does not work with noConflict
[02:05:14] <Kingsy> ok let me check that out
[02:06:01] <Kingsy> faraway: typing jQuery.fn into the console window on firebug returns nothing
[02:06:08] <Kingsy> well it returns [ ]
[02:06:53] <blackspotwiggins> Kingsy, did you try it without noconflict?
[02:07:07] <seutje> Kingsy: not really what he asked, is it?
[02:07:25] <Kingsy> oh sorry
[02:08:14] <seutje> I never use noconflict without a closure to pass it as $
[02:08:34] <seutje> s/noconflict/jquery/
[02:08:43] <Kingsy> funny thing is.. this all worked yesterday they it just "broke"
[02:09:07] <Kingsy> so the scripts definately work in noconflict because they were yesterday
[02:09:15] <Kingsy> ever weirder.. I don't really remember changing anything
[02:09:40] <blackspotwiggins> Kingsy, bisect your code then
[02:09:41] <Kingsy> faraway: console.dir(jQuery.fn); returns a list of functions but anythingSlider and tabs is not in the list
[02:10:56] <seutje> are you loading jquery ui from an external source?
[02:11:21] <Kingsy> nope onsite --> jQuery UI 1.8.6
[02:12:35] <mazzachre> Can anyone help me with an idea to get this working in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/A3hSJ/
[02:15:09] <seutje> Kingsy: I'm out of ideas then
[02:16:43] <Kingsy> seutje: np.. thanks for your help :)
[02:17:03] <Kingsy> seutje: it must be a conflict.. I will just crawl through the files one by one until I find the problem :)
[02:17:05] <seutje> mazzachre: are you trying to make dblclick()?
[02:21:27] <seutje> mazzachre: if you want it in a single method: https://gist.github.com/399624 seems to work
[02:25:38] <john2x> test
[02:27:06] <ravenzz> given this markup how can I update the total on change? http://jsfiddle.net/ARPCw/
[02:33:46] <DarsVaeda> hi, I want to have a menu on the side that will open overlay divs, what do I use best? jquery ui tabs?
[02:41:35] <ris> so, from what i can tell, selector context gets "reset" inside a :not() clause
[02:41:39] <ris> am i right?
[02:44:13] <ris> or is selector context purely a filter and doesn't alter the semantic meaning of a selector at all?
[02:44:18] <slartsa> if anyone asks, while using jcart shopping cart script $('.content').load(this.href); will not work, instead one needs to do something like $.get(this.href, function(data) { $('.content').html(data); });
[02:58:54] <granden> When having a javascript alert
[02:59:09] <granden> It displays the adress of the site sending the alert.
[02:59:14] <granden> Could I hide that?
[03:00:36] <johnkpaul> granden: no
[03:01:54] <faraway> granden: the normal javascript aper could not be modified, but you could think of query ui modal dialog, but then you likely need to change your code cause ui modal dialog won't block the further execution of your code
[03:02:08] <faraway> garann: -aper +alert
[03:03:55] <granden> Okej
[03:04:24] <granden> Hmm, sounds like a ui modal dialog would suite me better then.
[03:04:36] <granden> Because I would ilke other javascripts code to be run during the process of that window being opened.
[03:08:53] <gvo> granden: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[03:14:24] <beasty> anyone playing around with jquery mobile ?
[03:20:46] <granden> gvo: Thanks!
[03:21:08] <granden> Tried searching for a stopwatch, that shows minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
[03:21:10] <Log1x> hi. if i have a simple mouseenter and mouseleave for a wrapper to show a "Previous" and "Next" button, how can I make it work properly even when you're hovering the actual prev and next button that are being shown without it "bubbling" and hiding/showing repeatedly
[03:21:23] <granden> Could not find any good jquery plugin. Could anyone recommend one?
[03:21:25] <Log1x> http://jsfiddle.net/PFuUf/ is my mouseenter/mouseleave
[03:23:15] <johnkpaul> granden: https://github.com/robcowie/jquery-stopwatch ?
[03:23:50] <johnkpaul> ?hover @ Log1x
[03:24:06] <johnkpaul> Log1x: http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[03:24:17] <t1eR> hover users mouseenter/mouseleave though
[03:24:32] <Log1x> yeah, hoveri s just a shorthand
[03:24:37] <Log1x> is*
[03:25:04] <t1eR> mouseleave was created to prevent bubbling :s
[03:27:17] <faraway> Log1x: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/PFuUf/1/ seems to work, so i think there must be something else
[03:28:37] <Log1x> hrm, i'm trying to use a Content Slider, so it must be doing some weird call on hover over the next/prev button then =(
[03:34:58] <rmrfchik> Hi there. I have web server which answers for specific url with never-ending stream. i.e. "GET /events" never terminates and represent a stream of JSON with some kind of events
[03:35:40] <rmrfchik> what's the best way to handle this in jquery? I need to have loop "read json; process; repeat".
[03:37:19] <faraway> rmrfchik: imho some browsers support the receive of chunked transheres but it is not well supported right now
[03:37:23] <Nancy2012> I am looking for a dropdown listbox which allow multiple selection
[03:37:57] <rmrfchik> i'm stick to io8
[03:37:59] <rmrfchik> ie8
[03:39:26] <placeoweb> hi, somebody can access to jquery feed with a reader rss (not browser) ? http://blog.jquery.com/feed/ is not working
[03:39:39] <placeoweb> but http://blog.jqueryui.com/feed/ is working.
[03:40:53] <loic84> hi, it is easily achievable to have a hide show event propagate to all children elements?
[03:42:00] <shoky> loic84: what's a hide show event?
[03:43:03] <loic84> well let's say i use $.show() or $.hide() on a div, i'd like one element inside that div to pick up what happened and do something
[03:43:36] <mathi> hi all
[03:43:37] <shoky> no, that's not easily achievable
[03:43:47] <shoky> there's no show/hide event
[03:44:51] <shoky> and even if there was, it would get propagated to the div's ancestors, not descendants
[03:46:57] <shoky> hi mathi
[03:47:07] <shoky> you can talk here, no PM necessary
[03:47:12] <faraway> loic84: the only thing you could do is $(…).hide().find("*").trigger("myCustomEvent"); but deepending on the found of children the performance would be not so good. if you know which elements could listen you can change the "*" selector to something more restrictive
[03:47:19] <mathi> hi shoky
[03:47:43] <mathi> am new to this cht
[03:48:00] <loic84> oki faraway, this is acceptable actually
[03:48:00] <faraway> loic84: -found +amount
[03:48:57] <shoky> mathi: make sure your chat client doesn't show you joins/parts/quits/etc for this channel
[03:49:21] <mathi> am not understand shokey
[03:49:33] <shoky> ok nevermind ;P
[04:12:29] <Zhy_> Hey guys! :) got an issue with my page layout and ajax loading. I have 2 main areas in my app, "main" and "side" which can be populated independently with some content. Now the thing is , I'm simply doing $('side or main selector').load(url) which works good so far...
[04:13:33] <Zhy_> ... but upon refresh I see the page the content has loaded into before the actual content is there... I'll try to give a better example ^^
[04:16:03] <Zhy_> I navigate to an admin panel where user permissions can be adjusted. The page is a subpage, no ajax there. Now I want to navigate to my list of companies (this is kind of an business app ), which is no subpage, it is content that's loaded into my main area ... I'm now on a page like  .../admin/permissions#main=companies and upon page refrehs it refreshes the admin page , I shortly see the...
[04:16:04] <Zhy_> ...content, and then it loads my ajax stuff (using this plugin btw : http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/ )
[04:16:10] <Zhy_> Oh god -.-
[04:16:14] <Zhy_> sorry for the wall of text =D
[04:16:49] <Zhy_> Anyway! I got the feeling I should either have an app where everything is done by ajax or ... very sparsely and not in my "main" content area
[04:17:15] <Zhy_> Any advice on that? basically I don't want the actual page content to flash before the ajax stuff "overwrites" it
[04:18:08] <faraway> Zhy_: you want to have your page content invisible when javascript is active until the page is completely loaded ?
[04:18:20] <Zhy_> Hmmm
[04:18:26] <Zhy_> that sounds promising
[04:18:31] <faraway> Zhy_: or parts of it ?
[04:18:59] <Zhy_> it's the "main" content part that's flashing it's old content before the new one is loaded
[04:19:05] <Zhy_> so only parts would suffice I'd say
[04:19:25] <Zhy_> everything else stays the same , some left navigation accordion and top menu bar , nothing to change there
[04:20:47] <Zhy_> Hmm I'm doing the loading on hashchange event, guess I could hide the "main" element until ajax is complete in that event
[04:23:25] <faraway> Zhy_: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/AdgSw/
[04:23:40] <znf> Uhm. I seem to have a small issue with Chrome: The page at https://share.n-zone.ro/userconfig.html ran insecure content from http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/datatables/1.9.2/jquery.dataTables.min.js.
[04:23:49] <faraway> Zhy_: this code is just for hiding the main content on the initial load
[04:23:54] <znf> How do I fix that? :-|
[04:24:59] <faraway> Zhy_: as sayer the setTimout is just a placeholder for you content loading
[04:25:27] <faraway> Zhy_: hope you get what i want to say :D
[04:25:38] <faraway> Zhy_: sorry need to leave now for a meetingg
[04:25:44] <Zhy_> thank you faraway, yeah I got that , it's just to exemplify a delayed load ^^ I'll try to implement that in my app and see whether it does what I have in mind :)
[04:25:53] <pyxorg> Hi, I sometimes have troubles with some jQuery functions. My browser tells me that the method has no method 'XXX'.
[04:25:53] <Zhy_> alright, bye :)
[04:26:18] <pyxorg> for instance, i can't use the .first() method
[04:34:15] <nVee> hey guys, sorry more a trivial question, but I am not sure where to start looking. I want to make my dashboard page which has a number of widgets more dynamic and allow users to move the widgets around. What and where do I need to start looking?
[04:34:35] <nVee> does jquery offer some functions to achieve this?
[04:35:00] <depy> not really as far as I know
[04:44:41] <MINTTU> I asked in javascript, but i dont seem to get a straight answer. How do i check if (all) elements in a array are true ? boolean types.
[04:45:40] <xec_> MINTTU: you could try calling .every() on the array https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every
[04:46:01] <MINTTU> xec, thats what i tried
[04:46:16] <MINTTU> i created a array -> var err = new Array();
[04:46:26] <MINTTU> then set err[0] = true;
[04:46:43] <MINTTU> and 1,2,3,4 and so on..
[04:46:56] <MINTTU> I check with if(err.every(Boolean))
[04:47:01] <MINTTU> correct?
[04:47:03] <xec_> what?
[04:47:19] <shoky> every takes a callback, yo
[04:47:23] <xec_> .every() takes a callback function. did you read the link?
[04:47:23] <b-ot> xec_, No unread messages.
[04:47:36] <xec_> thank you, b-ot
[04:48:59] <MINTTU> xec, so to begin with i should create a function that checks a specific variable if its boolean and true or false?
[04:49:18] <MINTTU> then use every(call_that_func)
[04:49:26] <znf> Anyone has experience using the DataTables plugin for jQuery?
[04:49:32] <shoky> more like every(that_func)
[04:49:45] <znf> I can't get my table to work unless I remove 3 collumns from the table :-/
[04:50:55] <xec_> MINTTU: you could just use a lambda, assuming all the items already are booleans you can just return the item directly like myArr.every(function(item){return item})
[04:51:34] <xec_> MINTTU: or make your own little function that does the same and just apply that http://jsfiddle.net/8ZBpq/
[04:51:52] <MINTTU> xec, ooh thanks :)
[04:52:01] <MINTTU> I'll give it a check
[05:15:03] <Zhy_> Hey again ...got a problem with a disabled button - it's a jquery button and I first set the disabled attribute once it's loaded, now I cannot enable the button again. I can remove the attribute, yupp, but that doesn't seem to work for jQuery buttons as it's still got the disabled style and is not clickable
[05:15:09] <Vanek> Hi, help me. Immediately apologize for my translation. I have a student jquery $ (function () {
[05:15:09] <Vanek>      $ ('. goal')
[05:15:09] <Vanek> But when I add a new element to the page
[05:15:09] <Vanek> $ ('. goal_free_list'). append ('<div class='goal'> </ div>');
[05:15:09] <Vanek> The listener is not called.
[05:16:08] <NodeX> use on()
[05:21:28] <beasty> hi guys
[05:21:38] <beasty> is there anyway to hide a element when the page is loaded
[05:21:45] <beasty> and not $().hide() ?
[05:23:01] <skeq> whats the irc chatroom for sencha touch ? :)
[05:23:03] <Asone> beasty : modifying css property on element ?
[05:23:25] <Asone> $().css({display: "none"}) or something like that
[05:23:33] <allX> dont know what you want to do specifically, but hide it with css when js is present and unhide it with js when you need it
[05:28:24] <Vanek> NodeX does not work.
[05:28:48] <Kingsy> has anyone ever seen elements when they are fading in and out on IE8 and IE7 go black when they are in transition ?
[05:29:05] <NodeX> on() works fine
[05:29:10] <NodeX> pastebin your code
[05:31:26] <Vanek> NodeX http://pastebin.com/NUyTM992
[05:32:46] <NodeX> vanek .. wtf is that lol
[05:33:11] <Vanek> +)
[05:33:15] <NodeX> .bind('dragstart', <---- on('dragstart'
[05:33:21] <NodeX> read the documentation
[05:33:29] <adam_lynch> Is there a way I can reference/get the url used inside $.ajaxSetup's success callback for example
[05:33:34] <adam_lynch> Is there a way I can reference/get the url used inside $.ajaxSetup's success callback for example?
[05:33:40] <kvarley> How can I target all links within a section element with JQuery? $('section a') doesn't seem to work
[05:34:02] <Vanek> NodeX I knew, but did so ... as you just said.
[05:35:36] <faraway> kvarley: this should work, what is not working ?
[05:37:59] <kvarley> faraway: Lol, I was targetting the wrong top level tag.
[05:38:41] <Kingsy> I HATE IE
[05:38:50] <NodeX> everyone hates IE
[05:39:51] <faraway> adam_lynch: not sure but i thought you can access it with this.url in the success method
[05:40:32] <seutje> I kinda like where IE is heading
[05:42:57] <xec_> seutje: down the drain? :)
[05:43:09] <juha_> by ie you guys mean ireland, right?
[05:43:09] <seutje> you kidding me?
[05:43:17] <Vanek> NodeX live() is work
[05:43:27] <seutje> xec_: you should check out IE10
[05:44:01] <seutje> IE never gets any credit for shit they came up with
[05:44:29] <xec_> seutje: yes i'm aware. the problem is its half-life though
[05:44:39] <shoky> speaking of IE
[05:45:00] <seutje> I'd say, for the main part, that's the user's fault
[05:45:01] <faraway> IE has native mouseenter mouseleave and they have dargndrop support, thats really great -.-
[05:45:21] <Kingsy> seutje: are you aware of a bug in IE that turns elements black when they are fading in transition.. ?
[05:45:30] <xrdodrx> I'm trying to use jquery & jQuery UI in Greasemonkey/Scriptish, but it requests the images from the wrong domain! GET https://www.mturk.com/mturk/images/ui-bg_flat_75_ffffff_40x100.png when it should be requesting them from Google's CDN.
[05:45:35] <faraway> hmm … and the about the rest … they try their best :D
[05:45:48] <seutje> are you aware that in this context, saying "IE" without a version is essentially not saying anything?
[05:46:10] <shoky> i am making an app that will be loaded in a frame (yes a frame) in a website that needs IE quirks mode. but my app doesnt work with quirks mode. i tried setting the meta header in my app's frame to IE standards mode but IE still loads it in quirks. wat to do ;(
[05:46:19] <xec_> seutje: they are doing some nice stuff though, like including IE in automatic updates, but not allowing xp users to install anything newer than IE8 is going to make me keep hating on it quite a while ;)
[05:46:33] <Kingsy> seutje: IE 7 and 8
[05:47:00] <Kingsy> seutje: 7 and 8 real versions.. the bugs don't appear in IE9 browsers in compatibility mode
[05:47:35] <seutje> Kingsy: does this element have a filter applied to it?
[05:48:21] <Kingsy> seutje: no
[05:48:27] <Kingsy> well not that I know of
[05:48:47] <seutje> Kingsy: does it consist of a alpha-transparent PNG?
[05:49:04] <Kingsy> seutje: I have heard that around.. what is alpha transparency ?
[05:49:55] <seutje> Kingsy: instead of key transparency, where you have transparent or not, alpha transparency allows you to determine *how* transparent it is
[05:50:03] <Kingsy> ah ok ..
[05:50:15] <Kingsy> and original IE7 and 8 don't like that?
[05:50:24] <seutje> alpha transparent PNGs tend to turn black when fiddling with their opacity in IE 7 & 8
[05:50:40] <seutje> solution is usually to apply a background color to the wrapper element
[05:50:57] <seutje> if u don't want/need a background color, use a filter to apply a 100% transparent background
[05:50:58] <Kingsy> seutje: hmm I tried setting a background color to the wrapper.. that didnt work
[05:51:07] <seutje> k, then that's isn't the issue
[05:51:29] <faraway> seutje: sure ? never had problems with that in IE 7 & 8 with transparent pngs and opacity
[05:51:50] <seutje> google it and u'll see a lot of ppl have :P
[05:51:55] <xrdodrx> figured it out :)
[05:52:09] <xrdodrx> :%s#url(#url(http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.21/themes/base/#g
[05:52:16] <xrdodrx> inside jquery-ui.css
[05:53:19] <xrdodrx> unfortunately i can't use google's CDN now since i have to edit it like that :s
[05:53:20] <xrdodrx> oh well
[05:54:48] <faraway> seutje: hmm .. strange that i never run over this problem (i know i had it with the combination png +  alpha filter + opacity in IE 6) but good to know that this could happen ie 7 & 8 too
[05:56:03] <seutje> I'm sure it's some sort of clear typing issue,
[05:56:09] <seutje> it always is on those IEs
[06:04:26] <Kingsy> what is wrong with this --> jsfiddle.net/TaZpp/2/   <--   the slider isnt being run for some reason..
[06:05:45] <Kingsy> lol forget that.. the example is fooked anyway.. the links were local
[06:05:51] <Kingsy> so I cant show anyone
[06:09:50] <Georgios> hey all
[06:11:24] <Georgios> I've got a Javascript object writen inline from my template generator, which contains an ISO date. By default this seems to be encoded as a string and not as a Date - is there a smart way to make it recognize date string as Date objects?
[06:15:27] <Cryp71c> The documentation seems a little vague, does .closest() search siblings of parents, or just parent elements?
[06:15:46] <johnkpaul> Georgios: ISO 8601? I think that the date constructor can use that
[06:15:51] <johnkpaul> can use that directly
[06:16:18] <johnkpaul> Cryp71c: just parents
[06:16:35] <Cryp71c> thanks
[06:16:48] <Georgios> johnkpaul: right, but the object is written in total, automatically - i dont want to go in and change the particular field(s) manually...
[06:17:32] <johnkpaul> Georgios: change your template to {key: new Date(<%= datestring %>)}
[06:17:59] <johnkpaul> :) you're getting the same advice in ##javascript, Georgios
[06:18:30] <Georgios> johnkpaul: I'm getting "some" advice in ##javascript, of questionable usefulness :)
[06:18:59] <johnkpaul> yeah, it's advice nonetheless
[06:19:07] <johnkpaul> without knowing what your template looks like, I can't realy tell what you're trying to do
[06:19:11] <Georgios> can I do $.each on object fields? does it nest?
[06:19:21] <Georgios> I'm using an MVC framework
[06:19:37] <johnkpaul> Georgios: no $.each does not traverse deeply
[06:19:40] <johnkpaul> if that's what you mean by nesting
[06:19:51] <johnkpaul> Georgios: yes, I figured, but do you understand what I suggested that you do?
[06:19:51] <Georgios> that writes a JS object .... like var model = { "prop": "value" }
[06:20:06] <johnkpaul> yes, I figured, that's why I gave you the suggestion from a few lines ago
[06:20:07] <Georgios> no, because there are no templates anywhere :S
[06:20:19] <johnkpaul> when you say "that writes a JS object"
[06:20:24] <johnkpaul> what does the writing?
[06:20:44] <johnkpaul> your backend writes outstream.write('{prop:value}")?
[06:20:57] <Georgios> right
[06:21:04] <Georgios> want a paste?
[06:21:08] <Georgios> pastebin
[06:21:10] <johnkpaul> ah, I made the assumption that your MVC framework on the backend's view layer had a template interpreter
[06:21:24] <johnkpaul> what crazy backend framework is this that doesn't have a template layer?
[06:21:28] <johnkpaul> Georgios: sure, paste it
[06:21:51] <gnarf> Georgios: use JSON?
[06:21:58] <NodeX> why would you add the bloat of a template layer?
[06:22:22] <johnkpaul> NodeX: I wouldn't, but from what he described, it seemed like there was already something spitting out responses to http requests
[06:22:31] <johnkpaul> if that's outstream.write...wtf
[06:22:34] <Georgios> hm... it does have templates - I thought you meant jQuery templates... but the whole object is written automatically
[06:23:05] <johnkpaul> oh, like php's json_encode and python json.dumps?
[06:23:29] <Georgios> http://jsfiddle.net/ymrcS/14/
[06:23:35] <gnarf> JSON doesn't really have a standard "date" format, but generally people pass them around as ms or sec from Jan 1, 1970
[06:23:40] <Georgios> right! json.encode!
[06:24:09] <slartsa> http://jsfiddle.net/EVtKA/8/ I have this to load contents from external htm-files into wanted content. how about if I want to load pages from several contens with one click?
[06:24:26] <Georgios> gnarf: it does ISO dates, which is great and supported - just not sure how to automatically make it convert ISO date strings to Date objects
[06:24:56] <gnarf> Georgios: "automatically" ?
[06:24:58] <Georgios> "foo" is written my the MVC framework
[06:25:01] <Georgios> *by
[06:25:24] <gnarf> Georgios: when you parse it, you should know what fields are dates and you can just data.dateField = new Date( data.dateField )
[06:25:41] <Georgios> gnarf: either by customizing Json.Encode behavior or by passing the output through a function or sth
[06:25:59] <Georgios> gnarf: see, that's NOT automatic.
[06:26:50] <gnarf> Georgios: then you need to encode dates in some format that is detectable by a parser
[06:27:27] <Georgios> done - ISO format. is there a ready-made parser? or should I make a function that does $.each, nested and converts date fields?
[06:28:16] <gnarf> Georgios: what you're asking for is fairly dangerous - how do you plan on detecting that its in ISO format?
[06:28:31] <gnarf> also, why does it need to be "automatic" ?
[06:28:41] <gnarf> i mean, do you not know your own schema?
[06:29:23] <lathan> Georgios, var traverser; traverser = function(i,v){ if(typeof(v) == 'object'){ $.each(v,traverser); } else { // do operation on elements }}; $.each(json_object, traverser);
[06:29:36] <granden> Hmm, got some problem finding a timer/stopwatch that counts up. And displays it on the webpage. mm:ss:ms
[06:29:42] <granden> any tips?
[06:30:08] <gnarf> granden: yeah, write your own?
[06:30:16] <Georgios> yes, but schemas can change and if it's added manully, it's a more impl work and more maintenance work
[06:30:34] <rue> There’s probably a clock widget somewhere
[06:30:34] <Georgios> lathan: yeah, nice, that makes sense
[06:30:44] <granden> gnarf: Dunno where to start on how to make a timer.
[06:30:59] <gnarf> Georgios: so how do you tell the difference between a ISO Formatted Date string, and a string which happens to start with an ISO Formatted Date?
[06:31:02] <rue> lathan: i, v // ?
[06:31:09] <rue> -.-
[06:31:36] <Georgios> gnarf: regex?
[06:31:59] <gnarf> Georgios: what about a string that contains an iso formatted date, but shouldn't be a "Date" object, cuz it's just a string?
[06:32:00] <digitaldarwin> I'm trying to select all the checked checkboxes named 'foo'.....any recommendations?
[06:32:39] <lathan> rue, I know....not helpful, but its the each index i and the value v of what is being iterated....probably should be k key
[06:32:43] <Georgios> gnarf: that's a truly baffling case that will never occur
[06:32:48] <gnarf> digitaldarwin: $("input[name='foo']").filter(":checked")
[06:32:54] <lathan> ?:checked @ digitaldarwin
[06:33:02] <lathan> digitaldarwin, :checked
[06:33:09] <gnarf> Georgios: then just each over the object keys and find things that look like dates
[06:33:11] <gnarf> and convert them
[06:33:24] <Georgios> yeah, makes sense. I'll be on my way, thanks
[06:34:04] <gnarf> Georgios: these "baffling" cases happen... and then your "automagic" stuff turns into a pain
[06:34:05] <digitaldarwin> sweet
[06:34:13] <digitaldarwin> thanks!
[06:35:18] <Georgios> gnarf: I really can't think of a scenario of where I'll want to output an ISO date as a string, not on this project
[06:36:19] <EnginA> ping relay.enda.com
[06:36:22] <EnginA> oops
[06:36:39] <some_dude> hai
[06:37:26] <some_dude> how do I run a php file from jquery? don't wanna transfer any data just want to run it
[06:37:55] <johnkpaul> some_dude: $.get('/path/to/file.php')
[06:40:00] <some_dude> johnkpaul, doesn't work
[06:40:31] <johnkpaul> some_dude: what does "doesn't work" mean?
[06:40:38] <johnkpaul> is this php file on the same domain?
[06:41:08] <some_dude> johnkpaul, yep.
[06:42:22] <johnkpaul> some_dude: you answered one question, but not the other
[06:44:49] <some_dude>  johnkpaul , sry my bad. it is actually run, it's just not exdecuted properly cause I screwed up the php code.
[06:50:19] <granden> Hmm, got a bit of problem, I want to run a normal javascirpt function when my document has loaded. So I did $(window).load(function(){ ss(); });
[06:50:23] <granden> and it works in IE
[06:50:32] <granden> but on my ipad it does not execute the ss function.
[06:51:47] <allX> i am trying out the widget factory and would like to have this in the options:          options: {             tabsParent: $(this.element).children('section').first()            }, but when i call this options.tabsParent its empty, what am i missing? (if i call $(this.element).children('section').first()  it returns the correct object)
[06:54:38] <sphinxxx> anyone know any good background youtube video plugins besides tubular?
[07:02:04] <Krambiorix> hi guys, question: why isn't the ready state entered? http://pastebin.com/x1vE9xst
[07:02:39] <johnkpaul> Krambiorix: that's not a jquery question
[07:02:44] <johnkpaul> but that's not the correct usage of XHR
[07:03:09] <Krambiorix> johnkpaul,  what should i change?
[07:03:16] <johnkpaul> only after you open and send can the readystate possibly change
[07:03:26] <johnkpaul> ?g mdn xmlhttprequest @Krambiorix
[07:03:27] <b-ot> Krambiorix, XMLHttpRequest - MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest
[07:04:31] <NodeX> interesting to know that jquery wont $('.fademe').fadeOut() -> <input type="file" class="fademe" />
[07:04:46] <NodeX> but it will if you give it an ID lol
[07:05:13] <Krambiorix> johnkpaul, ow ok i can remove the xmlhttp.onreadystatechange=function(){  ??
[07:05:41] <johnkpaul> Krambiorix: did you read the documentation that I sent you?
[07:06:12] <johnkpaul> NodeX: http://jsfiddle.net/eGxQC/
[07:07:15] <NodeX> how strange, doesnt work for me
[07:07:39] <Krambiorix> johnkpaul, yes i did
[07:07:55] <NodeX> must be my browser
[07:08:29] <johnkpaul> Krambiorix: http://jibbering.com/2002/4/httprequest.html
[07:08:38] <johnkpaul> you _can_ remove it, but then nothing would happen with the return of your ajax call
[07:08:54] <johnkpaul> so if you don't care what happens, you can not have an onreadystagechange handlere
[07:10:53] <allX> hi, i think i am doing something fundamental wrong :) http://pastebin.com/6A3XDyAb  trying to access a variable of the options object but i guess this.element does not resolve inside options
[07:11:20] <Krambiorix> johnkpaul, ok thx !!
[07:11:30] <johnkpaul> no problem Krambiorix, have fun
[07:15:04] <DarsVaeda> hi, in this fiddle ( http://jsfiddle.net/msNhr/ )  when you move the mouse over "aaaa" an overlay appears, when you select the select box there and try to select an entry the overlay dissappears, why is an mouseleave for the overlay triggered here and how do I get rid of that?
[07:15:29] <darkfrog> When I serialize a form to POST via AJAX it doesn't carry along the value of the submit button that was pressed.  Is the only way to do this to manually add the name / value to the serialized POST data?
[07:16:32] <darkfrog> I'm trying to mimic the full scope of a normal POST
[07:18:35] <dabear> darkfrog: don't rely on the value of the submit button. afaik IE doesn't(didn't?) pass along the value of the submit button in regular posts, and that's one of the reasons it's not included
[07:19:13] <darkfrog> dabear: but I have multiple submit buttons on my page and I need to know on the server-side which one was pressed.
[07:19:51] <dabear> you should never have multiple submit buttons in one form
[07:20:13] <darkfrog> dabear: the HTML spec allows for that
[07:20:22] <dabear> if the purpose is to differentiate which was pressed, use a set of radio buttons + one submit button instead
[07:20:49] <darkfrog> ...and it does work in IE for normal POST
[07:20:53] <dabear> allow != best practise
[07:22:03] <darkfrog> dabear: best practice in a broad sense is not being violated...I have yet to read anything that suggests that this is a bad practice and it seems to work perfectly fine on every browser for POST, just not when using jQuery
[07:22:38] <dabear> fine, if you really don't wanna listen to what I'm saying, then don't ask the question :s
[07:22:56] <dabear> and yes, IE DID have issues with mutliple submit buttons
[07:22:58] <darkfrog> dabear: I can disregard your advise, but still have a question...
[07:23:07] <darkfrog> dabear: apparently it doesn't anymore
[07:24:15] <darkfrog> I can always inject into some hidden value which one was clicked, but that seems hacky
[07:24:50] <dabear> darkfrog: http://ehudashkenazi.com/explorers-single-textbox-form-bug
[07:25:02] <darkfrog> dabear: in fact, I'm finding TONS of sites where people use multiple submit buttons
[07:25:29] <dabear> with different values in the submit buttons?
[07:26:28] <darkfrog> dabear: yes, it's fairly common for things like "Save", "Delete", "Revert" type actions
[07:28:15] <dabear> ok, and the name field is also present?
[07:29:14] <darkfrog> dabear: in the post data? Yes
[07:29:25] <dabear> I would call that bad usability
[07:29:31] <dabear> no, in the submit button
[07:29:41] <darkfrog> dabear: why?
[07:29:41] <dabear> e.g. <input type="submit" name="foo"
[07:30:02] <dabear> well, pressing enter in a text field for example would submit a form
[07:30:35] <dabear> which value should be submitted for the submit box then, if it's not clicked at all?
[07:30:39] <darkfrog> hmmm....maybe I'll just add additional data for the last focused element. :)
[07:31:07] <darkfrog> this is a server-side representation of HTML, so I'll just fire an ActionEvent on the element that submitted the form...that's even better. :)
[07:35:13] <darkfrog> how do I listen to focus events globally to anything on the DOM?
[07:37:42] <faraway> darkfrog: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9F73Z/
[07:38:26] <darkfrog> faraway: what does "input" mean in that context?
[07:38:42] <Double_Rainbow> .join ##php
[07:38:42] <socialhapy> Double_Rainbow: Sorry, admins only
[07:38:46] <faraway> darkfrog: in the js code ?
[07:38:57] <Double_Rainbow> lol woops
[07:39:09] <darkfrog> faraway: selecting only inputs?
[07:39:15] <darkfrog> faraway: yeah
[07:39:23] <faraway> darkfrog: yes
[07:39:44] <faraway> darkfrog: no selection but listing only for all focus event of input elements only
[07:39:45] <darkfrog> faraway: what if I wanted it to select anything?
[07:40:14] <faraway> darkfrog: use *
[07:40:43] <darkfrog> faraway: thanks. :)
[07:41:19] <faraway> darkfrog: but with * you will get more event, not sure which element will also trigger the focus
[07:42:06] <darkfrog> faraway: it's throwing three events per focus now
[07:42:23] <darkfrog> for the same element...
[07:42:48] <darkfrog> http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9F73Z/
[07:43:02] <faraway> darkfrog: not for the same element
[07:43:10] <[Elephphant]> hey guys, how is the proper way to do a getJSOM inside an .each()? The return function is loosing context for the element ii want to change so is only effecting the last one.
[07:43:14] <darkfrog> says the id is the same
[07:43:32] <darkfrog> faraway: at least the "target" is the same for the event
[07:44:01] <faraway> darkfrog: you can use stopPropagation http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9F73Z/
[07:45:00] <darkfrog> faraway: I'm more just curious why the other three were happening now though.  Further, stopPropagation will cause problems if I have other listeners
[07:45:33] <faraway> darkfrog: you will get imho the event for all parents that can receive focus event
[07:46:00] <darkfrog> faraway: why was the target the same then?
[07:46:19] <faraway> darkfrog: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9F73Z/4/
[07:46:54] <faraway> darkfrog: that the element that actually got the focus
[07:47:08] <darkfrog> ah, I see
[07:48:07] <darkfrog> faraway: thanks for the help. :)
[07:48:28] <faraway> darkfrog: just to be complete : http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/9F73Z/5/
[07:49:02] <darkfrog> oh, so stopPropagation only applies to the current listener?
[07:49:41] <faraway> darkfrog: no stopPropagation prevents form bubbling up the dom (see the docs for this)
[07:50:21] <faraway> darkfrog: with stopImmediatePropagation() propagation will stopped for all listeners at this point
[07:50:31] <darkfrog> faraway: thanks again, that's been very helpful
[07:53:30] <johnkpaul> ben_alman: around?
[07:54:54] <kenster> http://jsfiddle.net/XfuST/
[07:55:20] <kenster> whats causing my open / close action to jerk when the content is anything over 2 text lines in height
[07:56:21] <Brodingo> the padding
[07:56:40] <Brodingo> also hnngggg so many ids
[07:57:08] <kenster> yeah its a tut . . . dunno enuf js to make my own
[07:58:03] <mikehaas763> Does anyone see any usability problems from changing the GMT in a selection dropdown from GMT to UTC?
[07:58:22] <mikehaas763> I'm just asking because I read that it's been called UTC since 1972
[08:00:48] <mbrochh> hi all. i have a problem with the autosuggest plugin... i am using a remote datasource and it seems to work but when I enter something the suggestion always shows ALL items, not only those based on the input
[08:00:55] <faraway> mikehaas763: what usability problems do you mean, that the people form GB don't know which time it is anymore ? :D
[08:03:16] <int> Hey. Has anyone here worked with cors? I can't get it working on Internet Explorer.
[08:03:41] <mikehaas763> Idk what you mean by GB, but ya just wondering if people will still understand it from a usability point. I see GMT a lot online, but the Windows timezone selector says UTC
[08:03:45] <int> cross domain ajax calls using jquery.
[08:04:13] <sphinxxx> int:  that only works if the server you're calling allows cross domain
[08:05:23] <mikehaas763> faraway^ where is GB?
[08:05:28] <faraway> mikehaas763: Great Britain
[08:05:32] <int> sphinxxx: My server handles the Access-Control-Allow-Origin stuff. Everything works fine for me on firefox/chrome.
[08:05:56] <int> sphinxxx: Any idea why it won't work on IE? Does jquery support it directly?
[08:06:11] <sphinxxx> sorry not sure about most IE stuff :\
[08:07:18] <faraway> mikehaas763: actually the GMT what you see in programming (e.g. http headers and debases is the UTC) but the GMT itself differs in some secs i remember correctly
[08:07:30] <johnkpaul> int: what version of IE?
[08:07:43] <johnkpaul> IE7- does not support CORS at all
[08:07:52] <johnkpaul> IE8 supports it partially
[08:08:02] <int> johnkpaul: well I am currently testing it on IE9
[08:08:18] <faraway> mikehaas763: but generally i would say that casual internet users neither know what GMT or UTC is :D
[08:08:20] <int> I want to get it working on IE9 and maybe 8. Don't care much about 7
[08:08:25] <johnkpaul> what is the problem that you're having, when you say that it "won't work"
[08:09:17] <faraway> mikehaas763: i mean they even don't know that they use a browser or what kind of ;)
[08:11:28] <int> johnkpaul: The ajax call fails. The error message I get is "No Transport"
[08:12:09] <int> johnkpaul: I tried researching about it and found out $.support.cors = true. After setting that it still fails and the error message is "Access is denied"
[08:12:36] <djsounds02> I cant seem to get my plus and minus quantity working on an input forum http://jsfiddle.net/pMZub/
[08:13:46] <johnkpaul> int: hmm, I don't know, are you using any http auth?
[08:14:14] <mikehaas763> faraway, lol ok I will just change it to UTC and be done with it lol. I just read another article on about.com and it says today it is most appropriate to refer to time based on UTC and not on GMT. UTC also apparently tracks leap seconds
[08:14:26] <mikehaas763> But the timezones stay the same I guess
[08:16:32] <faraway> mikehaas763: it think the real GMT and the UTC differ in some secs
[08:17:11] <int> johnkpaul: no http auth
[08:17:12] <faraway> mikehaas763: form usability the best solution would be to display/accept the date in the timezone in which the user is, or the on he set in his system
[08:17:38] <djsounds02> anybody?
[08:17:46] <djsounds02> http://jsfiddle.net/pMZub/
[08:18:17] <int> johnkpaul: I tried writing it using native XDR for IE. It still fails and I can't for the life of me find out how to get an error message for that.
[08:18:27] <xrdodrx> I have a variable, "page_html", that contains the HTML source of a page. However, it doesn't seem to let me use jquery expressions on it, e.g.:  page_html.$(".statusdetailRequesterColumnValue").find("a"); . Is there a way around this?
[08:19:51] <faraway> mikehaas763: because if you display in UTC or the need to enter in UTC the user needs to calculate and to know how :D
[08:21:26] <mikehaas763> faraway, right but it will also display it like this: (UTC-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada) so the user can see a rough location as well when picking. However, using some js I can set it to default select the timezone that is set on the local machine. Thanks for the tip
[08:21:34] <xrdodrx> I'l retrieving page_html with xmlhttprequest(); for what it's worth
[08:21:42] <xrdodrx> but I can't figure out how to act on it with jquery :(
[08:21:51] <mattfield> xrdodrx: fiddle?
[08:22:48] <djsounds02> please thankyou? http://jsfiddle.net/pMZub/
[08:22:56] <xrdodrx> mattfield: the page i'm requesting has sensitive information
[08:23:08] <faraway> mikehaas763: the one thing i learn in my usability courses was. don't expect to much form the user. most don't want to think
[08:23:12] <xec_> djsounds02: there is something strange about your use of .next() and its selector
[08:23:25] <mattfield> xrdodrx: you can do something like $.get('path/to/html', function(data) { $(data).find.('.statusdetailRequesterColumnValue a'); });
[08:23:37] <xec_> ?next @ djsounds02
[08:23:37] <bot-t> djsounds02, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:24:01] <mattfield> xrdodrx: but you can't do a selector lookup on a variable when it expects to find a DOM element
[08:24:10] <xec_> djsounds02: also, why are there +/- buttons both in the html and added via javascript?
[08:24:44] <djsounds02> xec.. dont know bud
[08:25:00] <xec_> djsounds02: you did not write this code?
[08:25:01] <djsounds02> copied it
[08:25:31] <djsounds02> xec_:  http://themes.jamigibbs.com/freshshop/?product=grid-pillow from here
[08:25:41] <xec_> djsounds02: well, i'm sorry but in order to code jQuery you need to know jQuery, and javascript, and CSS, and HTML
[08:26:33] <xrdodrx> thanks mattfield, i'm working on upgrading a very old script so i'll just slash out a large chunk of it and use .get()
[08:26:47] <imanc> html5 boilerplate uses function loadPlugins(el) to apply js that binds to dom events etc.  I'm just wondering why do it this way vs $(document).ready(function(){  // put all that code here..       ?
[08:27:00] <mattfield> xrdodrx: no problem, hope you get it sorted
[08:27:02] <djsounds02> xec_: oh
[08:27:15] <xrdodrx> it still has things like return new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); in it
[08:27:16] <xrdodrx> ;p
[08:27:28] <mattfield> wow! :P
[08:27:50] <xec_> djsounds02: there is nothing wrong with being new, but start small, read some introduction tutorial stuff.
[08:28:24] <djsounds02> I plan to, im just in the middle of a project :(
[08:28:46] <djsounds02> not the best time to learn a new language haha!
[08:29:13] <faraway> djsounds02: not the best time to make a project :P
[08:29:15] <Gho5t> Is there a reason why $('th:first-child').width( $('th:first-child').width() - 10) is actually adding to the width?
[08:30:28] <djsounds02> faraway: touche! xec_ fixed it now
[08:30:38] <djsounds02> xec_:  your words were all I needed :)
[08:30:40] <Gho5t> I can't reproduce it in jsfiddle but it's happening in my app
[08:30:48] <Gho5t> is there a reason why this might happen
[08:31:05] <mattfield> Gho5t: sounds like there's something else in your app that's causing the problem
[08:31:17] <djsounds02> Gho5t: maybe you have a conflict with additional things
[08:31:41] <djsounds02> Gho5t: I bet your only putting into jsfiddle what you need there?
[08:31:42] <Gho5t> i'm doing it right in succession and there isn't anything asychronously going on
[08:31:45] <Gho5t> weird
[08:33:07] <mattfield> Gho5t: I think you must have conflicts, because I can't reproduce that kind of problem in jsFiddle http://jsfiddle.net/MT96J/
[08:33:37] <Gho5t> yeah
[08:33:40] <Gho5t> ok thanks
[08:34:02] <mattfield> Gho5t: try console logging the width of the element and go from there.
[08:34:41] <Gho5t> that is what i'm donig
[08:34:50] <Gho5t> and that's how I know it's not being applied correctly
[08:35:14] <faraway> Gho5t: do you use colspans ?
[08:35:16] <Gho5t> it's basically: console.log($this.width()); $this.width( $this.width() - 10); console.log($this.width());
[08:35:22] <Gho5t> faraway: no
[08:35:37] <Gho5t> cellpadding and cellspacing is 10 though
[08:35:47] <quicksilver> well you can't alter the width of all elements.
[08:35:56] <mattfield> Gho5t: for starters it's way better to store the width() in a variable.
[08:35:58] <quicksilver> if its width is constrained by its layout and the box model around it
[08:36:04] <Gho5t> mattfield: it is
[08:36:08] <Gho5t> that was my concise example
[08:36:10] <quicksilver> then you can try to set it all you like, it won't change :)
[08:36:24] <Gho5t> quicksilver: even when deducting?
[08:36:39] <faraway> Gho5t: on thing you could test is that you set the table-layout  to fixed
[08:36:41] <int> So no one has any idea about this? cors in IE
[08:36:53] <mattfield> have you tried using innerWidth on outerWidth? width() doesn't include padding or margins
[08:37:10] <Gho5t> mattfield: true. will try that
[08:37:28] <Gho5t> if that doesn't work I'll pastebin
[08:37:43] <mattfield> Gho5t: cool, best of luck
[08:37:51] <mattfield> what's the problem int?
[08:38:42] <aclockworkpeter> hey guys... I'm having an issue with getting my search box to behave consistently
[08:38:47] <aclockworkpeter> I have this: http://pastie.org/private/cuykzl8mwhtmn4sxyyhqeg
[08:39:49] <mattfield> int: IE has very poor support for CORS. Nothing in 7, only partial in 8 and 9 (and that's using the XDomainRequest object)
[08:39:50] <int> mattfield: CORS isn't working on IE. Works fine on firefox and chrome.
[08:39:57] <aclockworkpeter> basically, work request lists don't have a link to the first time when the user writes their search query and then hits the "enter" button
[08:40:17] <int> mattfield: Dont't care about 7. Wanna get it working on IE9 and maybe 8.
[08:40:46] <mattfield> int: it's a known bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283
[08:40:53] <int> mattfield: I get "No Transport" error. Then I found out about $.support.cors = true. After setting that I get "Access denied"
[08:41:31] <mattfield> int: you'll need a plugin, since it's not in jQuery core yet
[08:42:56] <mattfield> int: try this https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/ajax/xdr.js
[08:43:06] <int> mattfield: I am trying this: https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest
[08:43:28] <int> The jsfiddle he has attached works on IE for me. But I get the same error on my site.
[08:43:43] <mattfield> how are you making the request on your site?
[08:44:02] <int> mattfield: Also I tried to write native XDR. The send call fails. I can't find a way to see error messages for xdr/
[08:44:05] <Lee-Lee> anyone now of a nice jquery slideshow that has navigation?
[08:44:08] <int> mattfield: ajax POST.
[08:44:20] <xec_> djsounds02: the code you copied is quite horrible so i made you this. maybe you can read through it and see if you understand it, and ask about the parts you don't understand: http://jsfiddle.net/pMZub/1/
[08:46:10] <mattfield> int: I'd try using ajaxHooks. If you're still having problems, then I'd re-check your server set up, to make sure there aren't client/server conflicts
[08:47:01] <Gho5t> ok that didn't work
[08:47:02] <Gho5t> http://pastebin.com/0d6QmpsS
[08:47:23] <Gho5t> mattfield: getting the outerWidth() isn't really going to help since that is read only
[08:47:37] <djsounds02> xec_: before I read through that I tried it first and saw that it adds it to the cart as soon as you click the plus or minus http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/refrigeration/product/test-product-1/
[08:47:52] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/msNhr/ why does #overlay that appears if you hover over "aaaa"  disapear when you select something from the dropdown?
[08:49:25] <mattfield> DarsVaeda: probably because, when you select something from the drop down, your cursor is then off the element and thus fires the mouseleave function
[08:49:41] <xec_> djsounds02: you pobably have something interfering with the <button>s, try something else, like a simple <span> instead, and style it to look like whatever
[08:49:48] <DarsVaeda> hrm...how do I get around this?
[08:50:39] <mattfield> djsounds02: what does el refer to here?
[08:50:45] <djsounds02> my add to cart is a <button> if I change that to an input that should be ok?
[08:51:06] <mattfield> sorry, Gho5t, what does el refer to here
[08:51:06] <mattfield> ?
[08:51:15] <djsounds02> mattfield: lol was wondering then!
[08:51:30] <mattfield> yep, sorry! :P
[08:51:38] <Gho5t> my widget
[08:52:03] <Gho5t>  var el = this.element;
[08:53:24] <adam_lynch> Hey guys, what I'm trying to do should be easy
[08:53:34] <mattfield> why are you passing it into Math.floor? You shouldn't get a floating point number back from a width…
[08:53:45] <adam_lynch> When the dom is ready I load a few JS scripts with $.getScript
[08:53:59] <adam_lynch> on the click of a button I want to run a function contained in one of those scripts
[08:53:59] <Gho5t> you will if you divide by an odd number
[08:54:01] <adam_lynch> this works
[08:54:03] <mattfield> true
[08:54:04] <xec_> djsounds02: maybe it's beacuse it's inside a form. try swapping <button> with something else
[08:54:08] <xec_> djsounds02: http://jsfiddle.net/pMZub/2/
[08:54:22] <mattfield> it would really help to see the markup along side here
[08:54:28] <Gho5t> console.log(offsetWidth); // 1
[08:54:29] <adam_lynch> all I want to do is check if the function doesn't already exist *yet*, then wait until it does
[08:54:31] <adam_lynch> and then call it
[08:54:32] <Gho5t> yeah
[08:54:36] <Gho5t> umm
[08:54:40] <Gho5t> let me see if I can do that
[08:54:43] <adam_lynch> instead of just complaining that it's undefined
[08:54:49] <djsounds02> xec_: I have I have put them as input buttons and they seem great and work great
[08:54:55] <mattfield> if you could throw it into a fiddle, that'd be a huge help
[08:55:10] <djsounds02> xec_: $.fn what is the fn?
[08:55:16] <Gho5t> mattfield: let me explain what i'm doing and maybe I can skip going this route anyways...
[08:55:30] <Gho5t> I am creating a table with fixed headers and scrollable data
[08:55:39] <Gho5t> i want to resize the tds to match the ths
[08:55:50] <Gho5t> i have to take into account the  width of the scrollbar
[08:56:01] <Gho5t> can you think of a better way
[08:56:28] <xec_> djsounds02: it's the preferred way of attaching a method to jQuery, as a plugin.
[08:56:33] <Gho5t> i basically have them matching but the scrollbar is screwing it up
[08:56:45] <Gho5t> so i try to deduct x pixels from each header to make up for the width of the scrollbar
[08:56:52] <k1ng> can anyone recommend me a plugin like isotope, but it will support dragging and resizing with jquery ui
[08:56:56] <xec_> djsounds02: essentially allows me to extend jQuery with another command so to speak
[08:56:57] <k1ng> or something
[08:57:16] <djsounds02> ah ok
[08:57:20] <faraway> Gho5t: i had two approaches when i did scrollable tables. on was to wrap the content of the td/th into divs and change them in size (with e.g. overflow hidden) the other one was not to use table and do all with divs … depends on the situation
[08:57:28] <xec_> djsounds02: technically it's just an alias for jQuery.prototype
[08:57:35] <mattfield> faraway is spot on
[08:57:52] <int> mattfield: that plugin you linked me to. I just need to include that js on my page and make no changes to my $.ajax call?
[08:57:55] <Gho5t> yeah I'm doing the former
[08:57:56] <int> It will just extend it?
[08:57:59] <Gho5t> basically
[08:59:01] <faraway> mattfield: i'm stuck in an own problem  and hope to get a solution by thinking about something else :D
[08:59:15] <mattfield> int: once you've built it, yeah.
[08:59:51] <mattfield> int: grab the repo from https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks, cd into the directory, run make, and it'll be in the dist/ subdirectory
[08:59:56] <mattfield> faraday: :)
[09:00:09] <mattfield> faraway: :) !
[09:00:53] <int> mattfield: oh, I can't use  that xdr.js file?
[09:01:14] <mattfield> int: i'd include the whole thing to cover any dependencies
[09:03:19] <faraway> mattfield: is some lazy loading pus/sub and events handling problem, that has nothing to to with jquery and drives me crazy since some days already :D
[09:03:40] <mattfield> faraway: sounds like a barrel o' fun :D
[09:04:05] <faraway> mattfield: you won't believe how much fun it is :D
[09:05:07] <int> mattfield: it goes in the error callback with no useful error message :(
[09:05:18] <int> mattfield: does IE require any other headers from the server side?
[09:05:38] <int> for cors
[09:06:12] <mattfield> int: you shouldn't need to change the headers if you're using CORS...
[09:06:35] <faraway> mattfield: after that i'll come to the real fun ^^ transaction save remote data manipulation supporting collaborative work
[09:07:09] <mattfield> faraway: you must be having so much fun right now.
[09:07:29] <mattfield> what is it you're requesting?
[09:09:12] <mattfield> int: all you should need in your HTTP response header is Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[09:09:35] <mattfield> although that'll vary based on what kind of server you're on
[09:09:42] <mattfield> int: http://enable-cors.org/
[09:12:32] <wfq> hi guys
[09:12:56] <joikus> im trying to get javascript to print using regular print dialog, instead of that previewer in Chrome
[09:13:20] <atxq> I am returning a json file, but am having issues loading the data into input. After I return the json object, how can I access the data?
[09:13:49] <wfq> Can I changes the attributes of a few elements of the same type by using their 'class' attribute at once or $('myclass') will provide an array of such elements?
[09:13:54] <xrdodrx> are you still there mattfield ?
[09:14:02] <faraway> joikus: the only thing you can do is call print() and then it depends on the browser what or if it does something
[09:15:10] <xrdodrx> var requesters = $.get(link, function(data) {  function(data) { $(data).find.('.statusdetailRequesterColumnValue a');}, "html"); console.log(requesters) does nothing
[09:15:16] <xrdodrx> and I have no idea why
[09:15:34] <xrdodrx> if I just have function(data) return the data, i get much the same thing i was getting with xmlhttprequest()
[09:15:48] <xrdodrx> however jquery refuses to do any action on the data
[09:16:55] <wfq> I mean can I just do this please var allSameClasses = $('myclass')? What would that return? an object of objects?
[09:17:23] <quicksilver> wfq: all jquery selectors return array-like things yes.
[09:17:34] <quicksilver> they're actually jQuery object by they behave like arrays.
[09:17:44] <quicksilver> and you mean $('.myclass')
[09:17:46] <quicksilver> the . is rather important
[09:18:41] <wfq> sorry, I missed the dot. Thanks
[09:18:52] <joikus> faraway apparently some sites on chrome dont show preview on print, according to my client
[09:19:24] <faraway> joikus: do you know one of these ?
[09:20:04] <mattfield> int: yo, still here
[09:20:17] <int> mattfield: yep
[09:20:25] <mattfield> still here xrdodrx
[09:20:38] <mattfield> int: any joy?
[09:21:05] <int> mattfield: nope. I tried the ajax hook thing, also writing the xdr code myself. It goes in the error callback
[09:21:26] <int> mattfield: on server I don't even get a OPTIONS request.
[09:22:45] <xrdodrx> mattfield: at the end of the day i need to get an array of all the text inside the links that are inside table cells with the class statusdetail... :)
[09:23:16] <mattfield> ok, xrdodrx. firstly, you don't necessarily need to pass the dataType, $.get will figure that out. also, don't store the $.get request in a variable
[09:23:30] <mattfield> make the request, then do what you need to do in the callback function
[09:24:13] <mattfield> oh, ok. why the ajax request then? is the data coming from a different page?
[09:24:13] <xrdodrx> duh, just like xmlhttprequest() .-.
[09:24:18] <xrdodrx> yes mattfield
[09:24:35] <xrdodrx> I have no control over the other page, this is a userscript :)
[09:24:55] <mattfield> either way, console logging a variable won't give you the data.
[09:25:13] <mattfield> you need to do a console.log(data) in the callback
[09:25:41] <mattfield> it's an async request, so without getting into deferred and promises, you can't do anything until you get a response.
[09:26:20] <mattfield> so, trying to store the response in a variable, then doing console.log immediately after, won't work. there might not be any response to log.
[09:26:35] <MLO_> hi
[09:27:06] <xrdodrx> yes mattfield, that was the result of much frustration. doing it the right way gives me the error "XML filter applied to non-XML data"
[09:27:18] <xrdodrx> I probably shouldn't have showed you the obviously erroneous thing I was trying at the moment ;)
[09:27:30] <mattfield> aaaaah ;)
[09:28:06] <xrdodrx> var requesters = $.get(link, function(data) {whatineed = $(data).find.('.statusdetailRequesterColumnValue a');}, "html");
[09:28:09] <xrdodrx> console.log(whatineed)
[09:28:14] <xrdodrx> :p
[09:28:21] <xrdodrx> XML filter applied to non-XML data :(
[09:28:38] <xrdodrx> therefore i tried to mark it as being DOM data by specifying the dataType, which didn't work either
[09:28:59] <MLO_> am I correct, that the buttons appliablie to JQueryUI dialogs are not full-featured button widgets?
[09:29:27] <mattfield> hmm. is jQuery in with noConflict, or still assigned to $?
[09:29:52] <mattfield> in ANY of your code?
[09:30:22] <xrdodrx> i'm not using any other library than jquery and jqueryUI, jQuery.get() returns the same FWIW
[09:30:53] <mattfield> hmm. I've seen this before, but that's usually because of a syntax error somewhere. extraneous dots.
[09:31:43] <xrdodrx> would it help if i could upload a sample of the page? it's a status detail on amazon's mechanical turk and therefore will not be retrievable if you don't have an account, which is why i have not included it thusfar
[09:32:01] <mattfield> just out of interest, are you testing this just in FF?
[09:32:02] <int> mattfield: this is interesting. I installed fiddler to track what's happening on IE.
[09:32:08] <xrdodrx> yes mattfield, I am
[09:32:14] <int> mattfield: I see a 502 response for that call.
[09:32:31] <mattfield> ah. right. try doing it in chrome and see what console error you get.
[09:32:38] <mattfield> a 502, eh? hmm.
[09:32:40] <int> mattfield: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.
[09:32:51] <mattfield> yeah, bad gateway
[09:32:59] <int> why would I get that? :/
[09:33:26] <mattfield> well, it's usually from poor IP comms
[09:33:51] <mattfield> try wiping your browser cache completely and try again
[09:34:26] <mattfield> xrdodrx: do you get an uncaught syntax error in chrome?
[09:34:38] <k1ng> can anyone recommend me a plugin like isotope, but it will support dragging and resizing with jquery ui
[09:35:01] <xrdodrx> mattfield: i'm working on trying it in chrome :) i don't use it often so i'm having to jump through some hoops
[09:35:18] <MLO_> is it possible to disable buttons created by UI dialog widget?
[09:35:55] <MLO_> or do I have to do it by hand (remove handlers, add state-disabled, etc...)?
[09:36:02] <mattfield> cool xrdodrx :)
[09:36:18] <mattfield> if you end up with a syntax error, that could be the whole problem
[09:36:20] <Cryp71c> Is there a better way to write $('#someID input, #someID select, #someID textarea')
[09:37:01] <faraway> MLO_: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#method-disable
[09:37:12] <faraway> ah sorry
[09:37:20] <faraway> did not read corrtly
[09:37:38] <xrdodrx> i do indeed mattfield! :)
[09:37:42] <joikus> When items are truncated I need to provide a tool tip so I can view the full string with a mouse over. Is this possible? I use .truncate{text-overflow: ellipsis}
[09:37:51] <xrdodrx> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( chrome-extension://ofjmcgbcaebmgbhokalfjmdlobbjaajn/script.js:200
[09:38:00] <mattfield> there we go! :) there's some dodgy syntax all up in your code ;)
[09:38:06] <xrdodrx> maybe i ought to stop developing in FF
[09:38:17] <kryl> hi
[09:38:38] <mattfield> FF is totally fine :)
[09:39:11] <kryl> please, what happens if I use selector on undefined node in DOM ? like $("#test").click ... and there is no ID=TEST in html ?
[09:39:27] <mattfield> kryl: then nothing will happen
[09:39:33] <xrdodrx> line 200 is just console.log(whatineed) though...
[09:39:52] <mattfield> kryl: if there's no element to bind an event too, nothing will get bound...
[09:39:54] <joikus> maybe .truncate:hover{text-overflow: none}
[09:40:03] <mattfield> xrdodrx: delete the line and keep going
[09:40:16] <mattfield> could be covering something up
[09:41:06] <int> mattfield: I got it. It was a localhost problem.
[09:41:09] <int> Trying to fix that now
[09:41:14] <mattfield> int: good job
[09:41:59] <Cryp71c> Why is the :input marked as deprecated? http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/form-selectors/
[09:42:14] <int> mattfield: thanks for the help
[09:42:29] <wfq> when iterating through an array of html objects by using each like htis: $('.rebid').each(function(i, obj) {}), can I not call obj.pop () function of such object?
[09:42:33] <mattfield> int: you're most welcome
[09:42:36] <wfq> .rebid is my class
[09:42:36] <b-ot> wfq, memorised “rebid”.
[09:42:37] <mattfield> int: glad you got it sorted
[09:43:55] <mattfield> wfq: why would you need to call .pop on it?
[09:43:57] <xrdodrx> even happens when there's no paren on line 200?
[09:43:59] <gvo> Cryp71c: http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[09:44:03] <xrdodrx> sigh
[09:44:12] <gvo> Explanation there.
[09:44:23] <wfq> xrdodrx, oh you mean that an html dom object is returned
[09:44:33] <wfq> rather than a jquery object?
[09:44:45] <xrdodrx> what wfq ?
[09:45:05] <mattfield> xrdodrx: still getting a syntax error?
[09:45:11] <wfq> I just want to change the disabled property of those objects
[09:45:11] <kryl> mattfield, and for functions like slider from UI ? I want to prevent from warnings or error :) and to understand how it works !
[09:45:20] <xrdodrx> yeah mattfield, even though there's no ( on line 200 anymore. i made sure of it
[09:46:03] <kryl> mattfield, if I use debugger I don't have anything so ...
[09:46:06] <mattfield> there's got to be something fishy going on, or you wouldn't get an error. pass it through jshint.com and see if that helps. beyond that, they're not much I can do from here
[09:46:07] <wfq> oh, yes I can access the obj.disabled property directly
[09:46:24] <wfq> I thought the return dom elmeent was wrapped up in a jquery object
[09:46:32] <mattfield> kryl: what are you trying to figure out?
[09:47:11] <xrdodrx> Line 199: var requesters = jQuery.get(link, function(data) {whatineed = $(data).find.('.statusdetailRequesterColumnValue a');}, "html");
[09:47:13] <xrdodrx> Expected an identifier and instead saw '('.
[09:47:16] <kryl> mattfield, I create my html with dynamic php, and I want to know what happens if I use jquery functions on undefined html ID ...
[09:47:36] <kryl> mattfield, but I think I have my answer. Thank you ;)
[09:47:36] <xrdodrx> so it's 199 and not 200, silly chrome...maybe it adds a line for some resaon when it loads an extension
[09:49:23] <mattfield> xrdodrx: nice work chrome! :)
[09:49:34] <xrdodrx> that line looks fine to me though, so, bleh
[09:49:52] <mattfield> if it's still throwing a syntax error, something must still be wrong
[09:50:02] <mattfield> without sounding too blunt
[09:50:10] <mattfield> I know it's bloody frustrating though.
[09:50:16] <knapper_tech> got a method that returns a deferred promise and i want to do something when the state goes to resolved
[09:50:17] <xrdodrx> oh, it must be. but it looks perfectly fine :s
[09:50:27] <knapper_tech> basically whenever the promise is done
[09:50:33] <knapper_tech> how to hook it up?
[09:50:59] <mattfield> knapper_tech: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ and http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[09:52:24] <xrdodrx> mattfield: that line looks fine to you too?
[09:52:32] <xrdodrx> it's entirely valid, i went character by character
[09:52:44] <xrdodrx> there's no reason it should throw an error
[09:53:35] <pifantastic> xrdodrx: .find.(
[09:53:41] <pifantastic> xrdodrx: should be .find(
[09:53:47] <mattfield> yep
[09:53:49] <xrdodrx> ಠ_ಠ
[09:53:51] <xrdodrx> LOL
[09:53:52] <mattfield> extraneous dot
[09:54:09] <mattfield> syntax errors. love 'em.
[09:54:43] <pifantastic> At least the error that was thrown told you *exactly* what was wrong
[09:54:45] <xrdodrx> when they said coding is 90% debugging, they weren't kidding! :p
[09:54:55] <mattfield> ;)
[09:55:28] <xrdodrx> ugh, chrome doesn't like GM_getResourceText...
[09:56:21] <Gho5t> figured out my problem. the table cell widths summed didn't = 100% of the table width
[09:56:31] <Gho5t> leading to unexpected behavior
[09:56:59] <Gho5t> i think jqGrid throws a warning probably for that reason
[09:58:42] <knapper_tech> so $.loadPage('url').done(foo); where foo is the callback?
[09:59:07] <mattfield> effectively, yeah
[10:06:17] <xrdodrx> :) got it working mattfield...installed firebug...learned i need to package two versions because chrome is too stupid to respect @require, @resource or GM_*, but I got it working! :)
[10:06:51] <mattfield> xrdodrx: haha! typical :) glad you got it working!
[10:06:58] <HEMI> So here's an interesting problem. I'm trying to sort some data for display using tablesorter. The problem is the data I have doesn't fit with any of the existing parsers (that I can see) and I'm having a hard time seeing how to write a parser that will handle all the cases.
[10:07:44] <techouse> hey! i have to invoke a php function via $.ajax, but the function can take about 1 hour to finish and i don't wanna leave the browser hanging, so what parameters to pass to $.ajax?
[10:07:45] <HEMI> They want a numeric sort within blocks...Blocks are separated by a dash. Blocks are predominantly numbers, but may have letters in them as well. :(
[10:08:34] <HEMI> So stuff like 2012-1-1 (which is not a date) or 2012P-1312-40A...
[10:08:36] <techouse> HEMI: emm, split the data into an array and sort the array?
[10:09:33] <HEMI> techouse: not sure the tablesorter plugin will let me do that. If it will, I'm not seeing how. :(
[10:09:52] <HEMI> I know I can split the data easily enough.
[10:09:56] <techouse> well, can't you write a function or custom method for it?
[10:10:02] <dabear> HEMI: tablesorter will let you create a custom sorter that sorts accoding to whatever rules you want
[10:10:31] <HEMI> dabear: yeah, I know...I wrote a parser a while ago, but it was much simpler than this. I'm having a hard time even figuring out how to start. :(
[10:10:36] <dabear> I've done that in the past. your problem though, seems more of a logic problem. how would you create a rule for that kinda sorting?
[10:10:49] <HEMI> dabear: right...that's the issue.
[10:11:17] <dabear> you would have to convert all values in the column to an understandable format
[10:11:23] <HEMI> "Group all of the blocks together, then group the second blocks together inside the first group, then sort based on the last block...Then the second block, then the first block.
[10:11:24] <HEMI> "
[10:11:26] <HEMI> Right.
[10:11:28] <techouse> wait, does $.ajax success parameter only wait for some text back from the server script?
[10:11:55] <HEMI> techouse: I believe so.
[10:12:26] <techouse> k, then i know how to fix my shizz
[10:13:31] <techouse> HEMI: i'd go at your problem with a multidimensional array
[10:13:57] <techouse> then sort that per sub-array
[10:14:25] <dabear> HEMI: (pseudo code:) define two cells, a and b. if value of a is the same as b, return b.subvalue > a.subvalue
[10:14:25] <HEMI> Hrm.
[10:14:34] <dabear> else return a.value > b.value
[10:16:27] <HEMI> dabear: hrm. Problem is defining values for the two cells...
[10:17:32] <HEMI> The multidimensional array might be a better angle...
[10:23:08] <HEMI> Break each block up into an array of pieces...myArray[2012][121][3] = "2012-121-3"
[10:26:53] <HEMI> Ooo...Maybe write the sort order as the data in the array.
[10:27:18] <HEMI> ...Hrm. No, I don't think that will work.
[10:34:00] <_ramok> hi
[10:35:09] <_ramok> if i do something like:    $('#myform').submit();      $('#mydata').hide();    and on submit i open a new tab in the window... are there any modifications to the submit button and the data?
[10:40:26] <HEMI> _ramok: new tab? In your browser?
[10:42:02] <_ramok> HEMI: yes
[10:42:26] <_ramok> i mean, are the information in the form still remaining when i submit the form with post and a new tab opens?
[10:43:14] <HEMI> New tab shouldn't affect the old form/page/data.
[10:48:18] <Gho5t> any performance difference between $foo.first() vs $foo.eq(0) ?
[10:48:49] <RyChiss> Can someone help me with trying to display a variable? I tried to display it (var wordcount) and it just shows blank: http://jsfiddle.net/4KkRS/1/
[10:56:22] <int> any idea why there would be a missing "Origin" header in IE?

[11:07:29] <SoulRaven> i have a few checkboxes inside a accordion
[11:07:43] <SoulRaven> and i can't check the checkboxes
[11:08:10] <Whirl3d> can someone explain why var func=config.func||$.noop; fails if config.func is undefined? Shouldn't it just become $.noop if config.func is undefined?
[11:08:12] <SoulRaven> but is not checked and remains checked
[11:08:36] <Whirl3d> SoulRaven, think it out, prepare a testcase at jsfiddle or jsbin and post the link back here for help
[11:12:06] <SoulRaven> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/53GVn/
[11:12:12] <SoulRaven> try to check the checkbosex
[11:12:17] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: what is the value of config?
[11:12:46] <Whirl3d> shouldn't matter, should it?
[11:12:57] <ARGONAUGHT> Can someone take a look at my code. And help me http://pastebin.com/ttL4Sywm
[11:13:31] <Whirl3d> SoulRaven, it appears that you have inline code for our submit function. Perhaps that's getting caught. I'm checking it out now.
[11:13:38] <shwaiil> hi
[11:13:47] <ARGONAUGHT> My bottom click function triggers the top trigger function... Problem being that it triggers every single button instead of only one
[11:14:15] <delko> Hello could someone check this simple jquery for me, for some reason its not working http://jsfiddle.net/rg3ep/#update
[11:14:21] <shwaiil> Q: I've created a preloader for imgs using the .load(). I found out that if I do the same page request, sometimes it doesn't work properly. My question is, is there a way to check if el "imgs" are already loaded ? Thank you
[11:14:58] <Brodingo> delko if you check the console theres a syntax error
[11:15:33] <delko> Brodingo where is it ?
[11:15:45] <Brodingo> delko youre using semicolons in object notation where you should be using commas
[11:15:53] <Brodingo> also, omit the last comma
[11:16:07] <SoulRaven> shwaiil: first you have to many var statment, and i don't undestand way: window.currentImage = navClicked + 1;
[11:16:07] <delko> ok
[11:16:17] <Brodingo> also, if youre selecting an id, you need to prefix it with a # like in css
[11:16:57] <ARGONAUGHT> Can someone help me?
[11:17:09] <delko> oh yes right
[11:17:12] <delko> i forgot about that
[11:17:36] <SoulRaven> shwaiil: and i see that you action is on <a href > tag, i best is to do e.preventDefault
[11:17:42] <fission6> is there a shorthand for toggling a class for an element, meaning if it has it, remove it
[11:17:45] <fission6> if it doesn't add
[11:18:01] <shwaiil> SoulRaven: I notice that you're using my nickname but it's not my issue the one you talking about ;)
[11:18:41] <pifantastic> fission6: toggleClass
[11:18:49] <MonsterKiller> Hey. Say i have var X = "cake". how can i use X in a .match()?
[11:18:53] <pifantastic> http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[11:19:19] <SoulRaven> ARGONAUGHT: all the answers from shwaiil are for you
[11:19:53] <ARGONAUGHT> I dont think anything he has typed has anything to do with what I am doing
[11:20:03] <fission6> nice!
[11:20:05] <pifantastic> MonsterKiller: http://jsbin.com/ucazar/1/edit
[11:20:15] <Brodingo> delko also, if youre trying to do form validation you should use the submit event, a form can be submitted in other ways besides clicking on the submit button
[11:20:29] <pifantastic> ARGONAUGHT: can you possibly recreate the problem with jsfiddle or jsbin?
[11:20:39] <SoulRaven> Whirl3d: strange, right? do you have any ideea?
[11:20:53] <pifantastic> paste bin is a pile of garbage
[11:21:03] <ARGONAUGHT> Ummm shoot.. All of my html is being generated by php its kind of hard.
[11:21:08] <Whirl3d> SoulRaven,  I am not the most experienced with jqueryUI, but I think your accordian elements have to be configured differently. You need something "clickable" to enable the accordian effect, right now it's your entire div
[11:21:19] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/53GVn/4/
[11:21:31] <pifantastic> Whirl3d++
[11:21:44] <ARGONAUGHT> I basically have a gallery. My top click is when you click on a thumbnail and animates a container with my larger images. I want a next button, so I set up a button that triggers a click on a thumbnail to the nth-child
[11:21:56] <ARGONAUGHT> instead of triggering the nth-child it triggers all of the children
[11:22:15] <MonsterKiller> pifantastic, oh right it just works straight off then. ty
[11:23:09] <delko> Brodingo could you show me how to make this this is what i have now http://jsfiddle.net/rg3ep/1/
[11:24:11] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/53GVn/5/  SoulRaven

[11:41:51] <k1ng> http://puu.sh/O0px
[11:42:04] <k1ng> empty space between F and G
[11:44:42] <Whirl3d> I love Crockford's explanation that "under the steaming pile of good intentions lies a elegant programming language" LOL
[11:44:50] <pifantastic> Crucials: recreate your problem in its simplest form
[11:46:19] <k1ng> can anyone help me with issue?
[11:47:04] <pifantastic> ARGONAUGHT: instead of using a global, you might try using a class to keep track of the index: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/j6Nsw/2/
[11:47:57] <pifantastic> k1ng: the first link you posted is a 404
[11:48:14] <Whirl3d> pifantastic ++
[11:48:37] <k1ng> pifantastic, what you see on http://me.k1ngdom.net/
[11:48:57] <pifantastic> k1ng: http://grimhappy.com/i/4019b5.png
[11:49:12] <k1ng> wth its seems fine,
[11:49:15] <pifantastic> http://grimhappy.com/i/637a1.png
[11:50:06] <Crucials> pifantastic: I guess this is the basic jist of it: http://jsfiddle.net/YYhnz/
[11:50:48] <jedimind> k1ng, thats probably one of the nicest page transitions ive seen on a portfolio btw
[11:50:54] <pifantastic> Crucials: and what information are you trying to send to the server?
[11:51:00] <jedimind> im on the fence about the overall design, it seems a little lacking, but that transition is pretty hot
[11:51:18] <k1ng> jedimind, thanks but i did not create it :)
[11:51:28] <jedimind> ah poops
[11:51:29] <Crucials> pifantastic: It is an image url I get with canvas.toDataURL("image/png");
[11:52:06] <jedimind> k1ng, where'd you get it from?
[11:52:12] <jedimind> is it part of a template or something ?
[11:52:16] <k1ng> a template
[11:52:16] <jedimind> template / theme / whatever
[11:52:31] <k1ng> about 2 years ago :)
[11:54:25] <ARGONAUGHT> Pifntastic. I used the index later in the click function to calculate where to move a container with larger images
[11:54:30] <pifantastic> Crucials: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/HU9z2/
[11:55:06] <pifantastic> and then on the PHP side, $_POST['img']
[11:55:11] <pifantastic> Crucials: ^
[11:55:33] <pifantastic> ARGONAUGHT: right, but if you maintain the class, you always know exactly where to to move that container
[11:56:02] <k1ng> ok
[11:56:03] <Crucials> Alright, ill see if it works (see if the php side actually outputs what it needs to..). Thanks pifantastic
[11:56:23] <k1ng> pifantastic, Whirl3d http://113.11.122.239/adsa/
[11:56:40] <ARGONAUGHT> I don't fallow. I only see the use of that in being able to represent to the user which thumbnail he clicked on
[11:56:44] <ARGONAUGHT> follow*
[11:57:13] <k1ng> if you move the A to middle you will get empty space, how do i make it auto filled? http://113.11.122.239/adsa/
[11:57:21] <k1ng> http://puu.sh/O0px
[11:57:33] <pifantastic> man k1ng , I don't know where to start
[11:57:44] <pifantastic> unfortunately, HTML + CSS just don't work that way
[11:58:03] <k1ng> what about jquery?
[11:58:13] <pifantastic> k1ng: you might be able to achieve that affect with something like: http://masonry.desandro.com/
[11:58:13] <k1ng> i am sure it can be fixed with jquery
[11:58:45] <k1ng> i its not resizable
[11:58:52] <k1ng> and it also has white space issue
[12:02:16] <Whirl3d> k1ng, what behavior are you expecting?
[12:02:31] <k1ng> the space should be auto filled
[12:02:37] <Whirl3d> Not possible
[12:02:48] <Whirl3d> you would have to manually do it every time you dropped it
[12:02:57] <Whirl3d> or make ALL the elements autosizable
[12:03:41] <Whirl3d> Not that it's not programmattically possible, just that logically it doesn't make sense to think you can fill a space with finite shaped objects and one resizable and get the edges to line up
[12:04:46] <Whirl3d> It's like putting a circle peg in a square hole, it just doesn't make sense. Occassionally, you might get it to appear to work (like if the circle peg is smaller than the square hole) but that's a fluke.
[12:05:25] <Whirl3d> If you snap the A to be a whole number multiple of the gridsize, you might have better luck.
[12:05:45] <Whirl3d> but even then you are going to have to manually scan for white space every time you drop a
[12:06:55] <Whirl3d> Don't get me wrong, I think you've done a great job to get your project where it is....it works pretty nicely.
[12:08:13] <k1ng> Whirl3d, thank you but my client is not happy with it
[12:08:31] <Whirl3d> Well, give you client pieces of paper and have him fix it on paper
[12:08:43] <Whirl3d> when he sees that it is not possible, then ask him how to fix it
[12:09:30] <k1ng> lol
[12:09:37] <Whirl3d> He can't organize several pieces of paper that are the same size and then one that is a percentage of the others to fit. But he can outline how he wants it to work;
[12:09:42] <Whirl3d> then you can manually code for it
[12:09:53] <dlam> is there a way to check if an XMLHttpRequest already has a request header
[12:09:55] <Whirl3d> it'll suck, but it'll demonstrate the logic flaw in the premise
[12:10:39] <Whirl3d> Then give you customer a second option: have A be a whole number multiple of the other's sizes. Then you can more easily accommodate his needs
[12:10:49] <Whirl3d> It still won't be easy, but at least possible.
[12:10:50] <dlam> im using somexmlhttprequest.setRequestHeader, and that function seems to append a value, rather than replace it dunno
[12:11:28] <Whirl3d> dlam, sorry, I've never heard of setRequestHeader....wish I could help.
[12:11:58] <k1ng> dlam, isnt jquery question?
[12:12:03] <k1ng> javascript*
[12:12:43] <dlam> yeah but people here know javascript >__<  haha
[12:13:35] <Whirl3d> k1ng, I think if you made A resize to a whole number multiple of one of the other elements, then you could adjust the index value of A dynamically depending on its dropped position. You'd have to redraw the entire thing every time it moved, but it might work
[12:13:53] <Whirl3d> but again, only for whole-number multiples in dimensions for a
[12:15:01] <k1ng> its sounds really really complicated
[12:15:03] <Whirl3d> either that or you would have to make them all resizable and then resize all the elements around a every time A was dropped. Defaulting them to their original shape/size if A was not a neighbor
[12:15:06] <St_W> hi. $(parameter);. is there a way to get a parameter for a given element (e.g. hWnd.getContainer().find(".myElem"); returns a jQuery Element) so that both calls give the same element as result?
[12:15:35] <tcial> Is there a way to make GET statements show the code as it's being retrieved, as in realtime?
[12:15:38] <Whirl3d> St_W? huh?
[12:15:48] <tcial> As my PHP script has a few sleep()s in it, and I want to show these in realtime
[12:16:15] <Whirl3d> tcial, not that I know of
[12:16:16] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[12:16:28] <Whirl3d> Germanazo, hello
[12:16:33] <tcial> Whirl3d: I guess I could make the jQuery pass code to my script a line at a time...
[12:16:43] <tcial> As it currently 'parses' a made up programming language
[12:17:09] <tcial> Ah well, I thought i'd check here before modifying my code.
[12:17:18] <Whirl3d> Sounds complicated
[12:17:54] <Germanaz0> I would like to know if there is some jquery plugin that show a ruler for measure pixels in the web site
[12:19:02] <tcial> Germanaz0: A quick google turned up this: https://github.com/alexteg/jQuery-ruler
[12:20:50] <Germanaz0> hmm not that ruler :S
[12:20:55] <tcial> What do you mean?
[12:21:19] <lduros> how do you call the kind of functionality when you hover over a td or a div (or click on it) and a larger div is placed on top (or it is expanded) and shows additional content in place
[12:21:30] <lduros> like a tooltip but on top of it, I've seen it on some sites
[12:21:45] <Germanaz0> tcial, for example, I would like to know my X and Y position in the screen, but with better user friendly experience
[12:21:55] <tcial> Your cursor position?
[12:22:06] <Germanaz0> yes
[12:22:09] <tcial> I guess you could draw some rulers on the edge of the screen, for the user to se?
[12:22:12] <Germanaz0> like those plugins for firefox
[12:22:12] <tcial> I'm not sure, to be honest
[12:22:30] <pYr0x> hi.. i have a problem... after i set e.preventDefault and return true, the jump with #jumpToSomeWhere doesnt work
[12:23:39] <St_W> let me explain the problem more in detail: I use a JS, where I can pass a parameter (lets call it "param") for specifying a dom element. the JS evalutes the parameter in the following way: domElement = $(param); In practise I can't specify a proper locator, cause the elements are dynamically generated. So I want to pass a jQuery object (e.g. hWnd.getContainer().find(".myElem"); returns a jQuery Element) to that JS. You could say
[12:23:39] <St_W> I should simply modify the JS, but that is bad when I'd like to update the JS to a newer version. any ideas?
[12:24:25] <tcial> pYr0x: Isn't that the idea of preventDefault?
[12:24:33] <tcial> To prevent the default action
[12:24:37] <pYr0x> yes.. but i return true
[12:24:51] <pYr0x> http://jsfiddle.net/4NYXt/
[12:24:56] <Germanaz0> pYr0x, you should return false
[12:25:05] <Germanaz0> or use event.preventDefault()
[12:25:21] <pYr0x> see at the fiddle
[12:25:36] <pYr0x> look at fiddle
[12:27:43] <pYr0x> the url still doesnt change into ..myurl/index.php#test
[12:27:49] <ini> im looking for some help with the imagemapster plugin and IE
[12:32:07] <Whirl3d> iduros, did you get your anwer?
[12:35:01] <St_W> Whirl3d: did you get my question now? (you previously responded "huh?" ^)
[12:35:33] <pifantastic> St_W: I don't quite follow your question
[12:35:49] <pifantastic> $() accepts a selector, HTML, a DOM element, or another jQuery object
[12:36:11] <pifantastic> so if I understand you correctly, everything should still work
[12:36:15] <warrenparsons> pYr0x: event.preventDefault() stops the default action from happening so you can perform other operations. return true doesn't magically restore that default action.
[12:36:29] <warrenparsons> pYr0x: In your case, the conditional is enough without the preceding e.preventDefault()
[12:36:34] <pYr0x> it doesent
[12:36:42] <pYr0x> doesnt
[12:36:47] <pYr0x> if i return true
[12:37:01] <St_W> so $("#myElem") and $($("#myElem")) should return the same?
[12:37:04] <pYr0x> the browser will not jump to the ancor
[12:37:10] <pifantastic> St_W: yes
[12:38:01] <Whirl3d> can someone explain how I am losing reference to "config" (click the lower ball to see the error in console)? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/N8LzN/8/
[12:38:36] <St_W> pifantastic: ok, thanks. then I've to investigate further where my problem come from ..
[12:39:12] <shoky> Whirl3d  return $.Deferred().promise().resolve();   doesn't make sense
[12:39:25] <shoky> hy
[12:39:51] <Whirl3d> Hey there. Why not?
[12:39:59] <shoky> you can't resolve a promise
[12:40:01] <shoky> only a deferred
[12:40:11] <shoky> should be $.Deferred().resolve().promise()
[12:40:13] <Whirl3d> Duh. I knew that.
[12:40:16] <Whirl3d> drats
[12:40:18] <Whirl3d> thanks
[12:40:35] <pifantastic> St_W: http://jsbin.com/igevaq/1/edit
[12:41:24] <shoky> Whirl3d also ,  $.when(promises).then(masterDefer);
[12:41:27] <Whirl3d> shoky, still, that may not be the error since I return $.Deferred().resolve() and it still gives the error
[12:41:34] <shoky> .then doesn't take a deferred
[12:42:02] <shoky> i'm finding any errors and reporting, not necessarily what you asked for :P
[12:42:53] <Whirl3d> lol, Cool. Neither of those solve the problem with config
[12:42:56] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: var config = statesList[state];
[12:43:00] <pifantastic> you overwrite the value of config
[12:43:05] <pifantastic> within that scope
[12:43:21] <Whirl3d> but before that I log it and it's undefined
[12:43:32] <pifantastic> console.log isn't synchronous
[12:43:39] <Whirl3d> it's not?
[12:43:42] <Whirl3d> wow
[12:43:47] <Whirl3d> what good is it then?
[12:43:50] <Whirl3d> that's rough
[12:43:58] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: vars are hoisted
[12:44:24] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: read this: http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting
[12:44:37] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: remove the `var` and it should work as expected
[12:44:44] <Whirl3d> wow
[12:44:48] <Whirl3d> thanks for the help.
[12:44:58] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/pifantastic/YkvUm/1/
[12:45:50] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: but also console.log is not synchronous
[12:45:55] <pifantastic> even though that wasn't the issue here
[12:46:35] <pifantastic> Whirl3d: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10040856/synchronous-console-logging-in-chrome
[12:48:04] <Whirl3d> pifantistic, great. I wonder how many times I have run into this issue. LOL
[12:48:33] <Whirl3d> now I am not sure how to put an object into an element's data object using the data-prefix
[12:49:02] <shoky> into its data-XX attribute?
[12:49:27] <shoky> oh
[12:50:14] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I put the states object in the data-states attribute and it doesn't convert it to an object. Should I leave out the quotes?
[12:51:28] <shoky> oh for JSON.stringify
[12:51:54] <Whirl3d> it's not parseJSON?
[12:51:54] <shoky> you need proper JSON :P    {"current": {"destCSS": {"width": ...
[12:51:55] <shoky> etc
[12:52:09] <shoky> sorry yeah, parseJSON
[12:52:11] <Whirl3d> crap. That's too ugly for words
[12:52:24] <Whirl3d> I'll find another way. Thanks.
[12:53:30] <shoky> also you have  width: 30px
[12:53:37] <shoky> 30px isn't valid javascript either :P
[12:55:16] <Whirl3d> wow, you'd think I would catch some of this shit. It just goes to show you how easy it is to think because you understand something a little bit, doesn't mean you can skip the details.
[12:55:51] <shoky> i'd stick to just having that config object in your script, not your html
[12:56:00] <shoky> no need to parse anything then
[12:56:06] <shoky> and pollute html
[12:56:49] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I was hoping to allow people to encode the states on the elements, but I see it's just better to handle that behind the scenes.
[12:57:43] <Whirl3d> I'd like to have a way to define a library of states that wasn't global, but was accessible by my function
[13:05:03] <Whirl3d> Arggg, I get cannot call method replace of undefined all the time now. I know it's always my error, but it just seems to always show up only recently.
[13:05:31] <wenzhixue> hello , guys, how can i load another page using ajax? like pinterest when u click some photo at maing page, it will popup a window show the detail page
[13:11:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/N8LzN/30/     any suggestions/improvements/complaints/ideas? It's working in all its klunkiness, but I am sure it could use some help...
[13:11:39] <ktstowell> wenzhixue: http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:16:18] <Whirl3d> wenzhixue, I think you are talking about fancybox or other lightbox equiv.
[13:16:39] <wenzhixue> i am using twitter bootstrap
[13:16:52] <Whirl3d> and your point is...
[13:17:14] <wenzhixue> twitter bootstrap has popup too
[13:17:18] <wenzhixue> i just need load the page
[13:17:21] <wenzhixue> to that div
[13:17:31] <wenzhixue> but it seems doesn't work  = = "
[13:17:37] <Whirl3d> then you should be set with ktstowell's link.
[13:17:48] <Whirl3d> ktstowell ++

[13:17:55] <wenzhixue> let me try
[13:22:04] <ktstowell> :)
[13:25:18] <Cade> I have a standard $(function(){...}); init block that associates functions with buttons on the page. The page will generate more buttons that need to be associated with functions. How do I call that init block again?
[13:25:31] <zeroXten> hi all. if I add a div to another div using hmtl(), how do I access the second div? e.g. $("#first").html("<div id='second'></div>")
[13:30:51] <shoky> Cade: you can call it again if you turn it into a named function (instead of an anonymous one). e.g.  function myInit() { ... }   $(myInit);
[13:31:34] <shoky> Cade: but if you set click handlers there then they will be set again..
[13:31:47] <shoky> that is, added to the current handlers
[13:32:04] <Cade> Ok, then I need to clear the pre-existing ones?
[13:32:22] <dogarrhea2_> lol. douglas crockford should probably not be a marketing guy.  "I recommend this book because it's the least shitty javascript book out there"
[13:32:31] <shoky> you should probably use event delegation, delegate the handling of the clicks to a static container element
[13:32:52] <shoky> Cade: e.g.  $('#container').on('click', '.buttonClass', function() { ... })
[13:32:59] <shoky> see ?on
[13:32:59] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/

[13:40:19] <quuxman> has anybody had issues with the target of a form being ignored?
[13:40:46] <quuxman> the iframe I'm targeting was created dynamically, but it's definitely there... when the form is submitted a new window is opened
[13:42:38] <quuxman> starting to think it has to do with the <iframe> being created after the document loads, because on pages where the <iframe> is in the original source, it works
[13:45:55] <rburton-> Anyone interested in a small project taking JQuery Pageless plug-in and making a few modifications?
[13:47:17] <hlve> i never realized how many people were in here lol
[13:49:24] <NoiseEee> quuxman: are you remembering to set the name of the iframe?
[13:49:29] <quuxman> yeah of course
[13:50:01] <quuxman> NoiseEee: if I run: $('[name=foo]'); I see what I expect
[13:50:26] <NoiseEee> and when are you setting/telling the form to submit to the iframe?
[13:50:36] <NoiseEee> s/post code
[13:50:47] <rburton-> I guess I'll have to dig into this plug-in and allocate time into it. :/
[13:51:04] <quuxman> NoiseEee: on a user interaction. I'm afraid the code is a little complex to post. It's in several files, not to mention that it's not open source in any way
[13:52:23] <NoiseEee> well then you might want to make sure $('[name=foo]') returns a populated jquery object right before you attempt to submit to it.. ie: "debugger;" or whatever route you choose.
[13:52:52] <NoiseEee> quuxman: are you setting the target on the form at page load?
[13:54:29] <NoiseEee> quuxman: if you are, you might want to set it dynamically at the submit point too;   ie: submitFunction = $('#form').prop('target','foo'); $('#form').submit()
[13:57:59] <quuxman> NoiseEee: yeah, I did that. I'm running "console.log($('[name=foo]'))" on the line before "$('#blah_form').submit()"
[13:58:38] <quuxman> NoiseEee: oh, ok, resetting the target of the form might magically make it work
[14:00:49] <Whirl3d> is there a way to use extend to not modify the original object, but just return a new object?
[14:02:03] <Whirl3d> nvm
[14:02:16] <Whirl3d> stoopid question, sorry
[14:03:18] <sunbeam> I've got a menu, a UL with LI's, this is 900px wide, and 40 px height. These items can have submenu items. When these submenu ul's are displayed, overflow should be not hidden. But, the problem is, when a user would have added more menu items than what fits in this menu, then the menu items that are on the next line also show up. How can I avoid this?
[14:03:23] <sunbeam> - also show up when the top menu item that contains the submenu is hovered
[14:03:25] <sunbeam> any thoughts
[14:04:51] <quuxman> NoiseEee: no luck :-/
[14:05:11] <NoiseEee> quuxman: truly bizarre.  i've done that successfully in the past :\

[14:09:18] <quuxman> hlve: :-/
[14:12:58] <ktstowell> You've been trouted
[14:13:22] <quuxman> guess I could work aroud this with the inter-frame protocol, and having the target frame submit the form
[14:15:11] <Whirl3d> wow. I am shocked that if you grab the data object on an element and modify the object, it modifies the data. For some reason, I thought the data object remained unchanged until you updated it by redefining it.
[14:15:46] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/DGrPK/1/
[14:17:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/DGrPK/2/   better explained
[14:19:10] <quuxman> Whirl3d: it's just an object reference
[14:19:24] <quuxman> Whirl3d: it's not like it's serialized or anytihng
[14:20:13] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/DGrPK/4/
[14:21:09] <Whirl3d> I've tried favs, favs.fruit. favs.fruit.melon
[14:21:35] <shoky> yap it's just an object
[14:21:46] <shoky> and you have a direct reference to it
[14:22:54] <shoky> Whirl3d: fuit
[14:23:00] <shoky> fruit/fuit :p
[14:23:14] <shoky> hm
[14:23:35] <Whirl3d> wow. I guess today is not my day for details.
[14:26:03] <Whirl3d> yuck. How would I go about making something like data that encapsulated a state and wasn't modified by a reference to it?
[14:27:02] <shoky> wasn't modified by a reference to it?
[14:27:19] <shoky> you'd copy it.. and not modify the copy :P
[14:27:35] <shoky> deep copy, that is
[14:28:06] <shoky> or serialize or whatev
[14:28:32] <Whirl3d> So, I would bet that about 60% of my latest rash of problems have been from corrupting the data objects stored on elements by thinking they were static until updated using update
[14:28:45] <Whirl3d> I guess kinda like .attr vs .prop
[14:29:05] <Whirl3d> using .data....sorry
[14:29:31] <Whirl3d> wait....do attr and prop work the same way?
[14:29:34] <shoky> umm
[14:29:52] <Whirl3d> if I assign a reference to something's attr, then change the reference, the attr doesn't change
[14:29:57] <Whirl3d> same with prop
[14:30:01] <shoky> attributes cant be objects
[14:30:09] <shoky> so there's nothing to modify
[14:30:13] <Whirl3d> except data-prefixed attributes
[14:30:19] <shoky> those are just attributes
[14:30:24] <MistuhKurtz> $($(this).href) looks pretty ugly
[14:30:31] <MistuhKurtz> (I need to get the target of a link)
[14:30:42] <MistuhKurtz> is it fine, or can it be optimized?
[14:30:43] <shoky> .data() does some sugar copying the data-xxx attributes into your data object
[14:30:48] <shoky> one time
[14:31:24] <MistuhKurtz> twice, in separate anonymous functions that return values for settings in a plugin shoky
[14:31:25] <Whirl3d> so when I change the data, it's not changing the attr.
[14:31:40] <shoky> the attribute is the string value
[14:32:30] <MistuhKurtz> actually
[14:32:46] <quuxman> Whirl3d: objects and lists are always references in JS, everythig else (primitive types) are values
[14:32:58] <shoky> MistuhKurtz i think $(this.href) should work too
[14:33:20] <shoky> wait, why are you passing a url to $()
[14:33:54] <quuxman> that's what I was wondering. $() expects an HTML string, a dom element, a list of dom elements, but not a URL string
[14:34:10] <Whirl3d> #targetid
[14:34:24] <quuxman> MistuhKurtz: you want "this.href"
[14:34:33] <shoky> o
[14:34:37] <quuxman> MistuhKurtz: or if you really like jquery: "$(this).attr('href')"
[14:34:41] <MistuhKurtz> I did $(this.getAttribute('href'))
[14:34:48] <MistuhKurtz> this.href would be fine?
[14:35:10] <Whirl3d> does href get rewritten with the base url?
[14:35:19] <MistuhKurtz> the href is just an anchor
[14:35:21] <MistuhKurtz> #target
[14:35:34] <MistuhKurtz> there's no base href
[14:35:35] <Whirl3d> you might need "#"+this.href.split("#")[1];
[14:35:47] <Whirl3d> Does it automatically get added in some cases?
[14:35:51] <quuxman> Whirl3d: good point
[14:35:59] <MistuhKurtz> why split the #?
[14:36:04] <MistuhKurtz> I need it to target the ID anyways
[14:36:22] <Whirl3d> but I believe the resultant html will automatically add the base url to the href
[14:36:29] <Whirl3d> so you might need to split it out
[14:36:45] <shoky> it would change the attribute for you?
[14:36:57] <Whirl3d> do a console.log(this.href) and see if it rewrites it or not
[14:36:59] <quuxman> $(this).attr('href') will alwyas get what's actually in the attribute
[14:37:09] <quuxman> Whirl3d: it does
[14:37:56] <Whirl3d> but if you have href='#something'    would this.href="#something" or "http://currenturl#something"
[14:38:03] <quuxman> Whirl3d: yes!
[14:38:08] <Whirl3d> lol
[14:38:09] <quuxman> Whirl3d: the latter
[14:38:12] <quuxman> Whirl3d: ;)
[14:39:05] <quuxman> just proves that you basically never want to use the actual DOM
[14:39:15] <quuxman> use jquery in all cases, even if it's shorter to use DOM level 0
[14:40:18] <quuxman> man i can not figure out this shit with my form target being straight up ignored
[14:40:32] <shoky> getAttribute would be fine too
[14:40:59] <quuxman> shoky: I would avoid it ;)
[14:41:15] <shoky> me too ;p
[14:41:30] <beeradb> hey all. Anyone have thoughts on why something like this:  .filter('form, select, input:not(:text:not(.form-autocomplete), :submit)') would work in firefox and not in chrome? is chaining :not's like that ok?
[14:41:32] <saimon69> hi trying to retrieve a particular a tag inside a partiucular div class
[14:41:45] <beeradb> my jquery selector-fu could be stronger, just wondering if anyone sees anything obvious about it which shouldn't work.
[14:42:35] <shoky> long selectors--
[14:42:36] <quuxman> didn't even know there was a ':not' pseudo-selector
[14:42:40] <saimon69> so far i reached this as $('div.thatClass')[12] but then inside this i need to target another div with another class, an A tag and an img tag inside the A
[14:44:23] <shoky> saimon69: $('div.thatClass').eq(12).find('div.otherClass')....etc
[14:44:48] <saimon69> goping to try first on firebug
[14:44:51] <saimon69> going
[14:46:26] <shoky> (you could also stuff it in a long selector e.g. $('div.thatClass:eq(12) div.otherClass a img') or smth
[14:50:04] <Whirl3d> what I love the most about debugging in Chrome is that it takes some random number of refresh and alt-refresh and ctrl-alt-refresh, shift-refresh and shift-alt-control-refresh and shift-alt-refresh events before it finally decides to actually refresh the page correctly. UGG
[14:51:06] <Whirl3d> and even then, if the content is cached from an ajax load, you literally have to open a new incognito window to see the correct content
[14:51:13] <Whirl3d> un-friggin-believable
[14:52:28] <HEMI> So, converting my ugly, ugly string into an even uglier, normalized string will let me sort things more effectively.
[14:53:18] <snover> if only there was some sort of disable cache checkbox in the developer tools that you could check
[14:54:04] <Whirl3d> Please, please tell me you are being sarcastic and I don't know about that really obvious feature...
[14:54:34] <saimon69> came out with this: $('div.moduleContainer:eq(13) div.moduleContentContainer a:eq(0) img'); according to firebug nailed it
[14:59:54] <WeeJeWel> Hey guys, I'm using jQuery UI to connect a draggable to a sortable. When hovering above the sortable I see the placeholder AND a copy of my draggable (So I have it 3 times: the original draggable, the dragged draggable and the one next to the placeholder in the sortable). How do I prevent the clone in the sortable to appear?
[15:01:54] <shoky> Whirl3d you can easily disable caching in chrome devtools
[15:03:05] <shoky> (click the gear in the corner)
[15:07:19] <Whirl3d> don't have one
[15:07:29] <shoky> the devtools options?
[15:07:36] <shoky> right-bottom corner
[15:08:15] <Whirl3d> wow. I have never seen that before. I didn't even know there was a line there. My monitor is too big. LOL
[15:08:30] <shoky> whaaat that's a very useful bar :P
[15:08:45] <Whirl3d> I have needed soo many of these options.
[15:08:47] <Whirl3d> lol
[15:08:49] <shoky> ;]
[15:09:10] <Whirl3d> anything else I should know? LOL Being old has its disadvantages, you know.
[15:10:33] <shoky> watch this http://paulirish.com/2011/a-re-introduction-to-the-chrome-developer-tools/  ;]
[15:10:49] <Whirl3d> watching now. Thanks.
[15:11:00] <shoky> they show tons of stuff there, but even that is old now, there are also newer vids
[15:12:55] <astropirate> In Sammy.js why does my page reload instead of just changing the # portion of the URL? I am on index.html#/  and i go to index.html#/page2  it reloads the page
[15:15:34] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/xgE3FLPs i'm stumped, this returns 'success' in the header but i cant get the div to show, any ideas ?
[15:15:54] <Whirl3d> papayawhip? LOL
[15:17:07] <shoky> he's also a fan of #BADA55 :P
[15:18:13] <shoky> oh he uses it here too
[15:18:47] <supersonic> hi all
[15:19:40] <anli__> When I use draggable, is a clone of the dragged element constructed?
[15:19:46] <anli__> I think it was like that
[15:20:07] <supersonic> i have create and add to my web application a file jquery.ui.timepicker.fr
[15:20:29] <supersonic> but the comonent is not converted in french
[15:20:57] <supersonic> when i go the page source that js file is referenced well
[15:21:05] <supersonic> what can be the pb?
[15:21:36] <shoky> anew_: the ajax post looks fine, problem is prolly elsewhere
[15:22:38] <supersonic> can anyone help?
[15:22:47] <anew_> damn
[15:23:01] <anew_> so strange
[15:23:33] <imsky> so throwed
[15:24:06] <derekpioneer> anyone know where jquery ui helper rotate is?
[15:24:07] <derekpioneer> ui.helper.rotate
[15:24:15] <derekpioneer> its giving me undefined
[15:24:22] <derekpioneer> but in a jsfiddle using jquery ui it works fine
[15:24:40] <dogarrhea2_> so, this whole optional semicolon thing was just about the javascript compiler inserting extra semicolons for you?
[15:25:41] <shoky> derekpioneer: what's ui.helper.rotate?
[15:25:42] <anew_> shoky echo json_encode(array('result' => 'success')); ad that is my json_encode
[15:25:58] <derekpioneer> shoky: see here
[15:25:59] <derekpioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/2X9sT/21/
[15:26:08] <shoky> anew_: is json.result == 'success' ?
[15:26:12] <dogarrhea2_> wtf? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2ifWcnQs6M  <---- why is he talkinga bout netscape in 2007
[15:26:14] <derekpioneer> no rotate method is defined, he's using jquery ui
[15:26:15] <derekpioneer> ui.helper.rotate(angle);
[15:26:35] <shoky> who's he
[15:26:56] <shoky> where did you see ui.helper.rotate ?
[15:27:24] <shoky> oh sorry didnt see you posted a fiddle
[15:27:33] <supersonic> please can anyone help
[15:27:41] <shoky> derekpioneer he's using http://jqueryrotate.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jQueryRotate.js
[15:27:54] <supersonic> i need to use jquery ui timepicker french version
[15:28:00] <anew_> shoky what do u mean
[15:28:20] <shoky> anew_:  you have  if (json.result == 'success') { ...
[15:28:27] <anew_> yes
[15:28:29] <shoky> i'm asking if that condition is true or not , when you run it..
[15:28:33] <supersonic> i tried to build the french filebut it is not working
[15:28:55] <anew_> yes it is true, but if i put an alert or console.log in there it doesnt show
[15:28:56] <derekpioneer> shoky: oh, duh, thanks for spotting that for me
[15:28:58] <anew_> so i guess it's never running
[15:29:17] <shoky> so it's not true
[15:29:24] <shoky> if console.log doesn't run..
[15:30:17] <anew_> yeah... (it SHOULD be true though, that's what i dont get i'm seeing 'success' in the header
[15:30:30] <shoky> anew_: seeing it where?
[15:30:31] <anew_> well it's not even running the else for that matter
[15:30:36] <anew_> it's running neither
[15:30:45] <anew_> seeing it in the network response
[15:30:46] <shoky> so it's not running your callback
[15:30:58] <anew_> how do i make it run the callback
[15:31:00] <shoky> what do you see in the network response?
[15:31:14] <shoky> i donno, it should run if the request is successful
[15:31:21] <shoky> put an error callback too
[15:31:23] <anew_> {"result":"success"}
[15:32:23] <shoky> you know how to add an error callback?
[15:32:29] <anew_> no?
[15:33:13] <shoky> return jq.post(..same as you had...).fail(function(a,b,c) { console.log('error!',a,b,c) });
[15:34:08] <shoky> and put a console.log('success') or something as first line in your success callback
[15:34:31] <anew_> damn where do i put that ?
[15:34:36] <shoky> same place where it was
[15:34:37] <anew_> oh wait
[15:34:41] <shoky> just add the .fail(...)
[15:35:31] <anew_> interesting
[15:35:53] <anew_> parseerror syntaxerror
[15:36:05] <anew_> type: "unexpected token"
[15:37:18] <shoky> weird
[15:37:27] <anew_> indeed
[15:37:47] <shoky> change the dataType to 'text'
[15:38:10] <shoky> and put as first line in your success callback:  console.log('success!',json)
[15:38:40] <shoky> should get an error also for the if (json.result) but forget that now
[15:38:51] <anew_> change which part to text ?
[15:38:55] <shoky> the 'json'
[15:38:59] <shoky> at the end
[15:39:04] <anew_> ah
[15:39:22] <shoky> which causes jquery to automatically parse your json string
[15:40:01] <anew_> well changing it to text did something - now i'm getting only the else statment
[15:40:19] <shoky> yeah, json is not an object now
[15:40:29] <shoky> but, what does the console.log show?
[15:40:31] <lduros> shoky: it's a human?
[15:40:33] <shoky> after success!
[15:40:42] <anew_> let me see didnt put that in yet
[15:40:43] <shoky> lduros: possibly
[15:40:57] <anew_> i put that on which line ?
[15:40:59] <lduros> :-P
[15:41:06] <shoky> anew_: which line did i say?
[15:41:24] <anew_> ok after (json.result == 'success')
[15:41:27] <shoky> no
[15:41:29] <shoky> that's not what i said
[15:41:32] <anew_> wups
[15:41:48] <anew_> isnt that the first line in the success callback
[15:41:51] <Andweeeee> can someone tell me why this doesnt work as a selector? http://jsfiddle.net/Luhring/nA375/1/
[15:41:53] <shoky> so why after it?
[15:42:05] <Andweeeee> (it's a one line thing)
[15:42:13] <shoky> Andweeeee:  :not
[15:42:17] <shoky> (not .not)
[15:42:51] <anew_> not getting a message in the console
[15:43:04] <shoky> pastebin your current code
[15:43:31] <anew_> http://pastebin.com/5j6difig
[15:43:52] <shoky> you did what i specifically told you not to..
[15:43:57] <shoky> you put it AFTER
[15:44:01] <Andweeeee> xo
[15:44:04] <anew_> lol
[15:44:10] <anew_> sorry
[15:44:20] <Andweeeee> wait to whom were you speaking just now shoky?
[15:44:26] <shoky> i meant:   console.log('success',json)  <-- should be the first line in your success callback
[15:44:30] <shoky> not AFTER the first line
[15:44:34] <Andweeeee> nvrnd
[15:44:38] <shoky> ;p
[15:44:58] <anew_> success! 1{"result":""}
[15:45:04] <shoky> there you go
[15:45:14] <anew_> where i go
[15:45:22] <shoky> that is not proper json, and even without the 1
[15:45:29] <shoky> it's not the object you sent from your server?
[15:45:35] <anew_> yes it is
[15:45:49] <shoky> thought you sent {"result":"success"}
[15:45:59] <anew_> hmmm
[15:46:03] <shoky> your php outputs that 1
[15:46:06] <shoky> from somewhere
[15:46:11] <shoky> donno.
[15:46:21] <anew_> success! {"result":""}
[15:46:24] <anew_> took out the 1
[15:46:27] <anew_> wait
[15:46:34] <shoky> still not success..?
[15:46:44] <anew_> success! {"result":"success"}
[15:46:45] <shoky> you can change 'text' back to 'json' now
[15:46:48] <anew_> but not entering the if
[15:46:54] <shoky> yeah because of the 'text'
[15:46:57] <shoky> change it back now
[15:47:22] <anew_> argh wow
[15:47:23] <shoky> so.. that 1 didn't appear in the network tab?
[15:47:24] <anew_> i feel like an idiot
[15:47:28] <anew_> it's all because of that 1
[15:47:33] <anew_> thanks a lot
[15:47:36] <shoky> you should've seen it in the network tab :P
[15:47:36] <anew_> great debugging skills

[16:02:08] <supsup> any way to make web dev tool in chrome stop on any javascript?
[16:02:57] <AMcP_> Just hit the pause button
[16:03:10] <AMcP_> next executed script gets paused on
[16:06:14] <supsup> cool thanks
[16:18:42] <booger> hey guys if i have two arrays of objects and i want to check to see if one object, from array A has an identical object in array B how would i do that?.... i tried B.indexOf(A[i]); after doing for (var i=0; i < A.length; i++)
[16:20:51] <rosie> Why does var data = $(this).serialize();
[16:20:52] <rosie> 	$('#items-table').load("drawer.php", $data) load the request as a GET and not a POST? The documentation says that if I provide a data object, the default method is POST
[16:20:57] <Whirl3d> shoky! I have disable cache selected in chrome dev tools like you showed me, yet the css is still not updating correctly. It's still operating off the cached version...which is crap. Any ideas?
[16:24:40] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[16:25:21] <imsky> good morning sexypants
[16:25:31] <shoky> Whirl3d: nope donno, always seemed to work for me
[16:30:30] <booger> anyone know how to find if A[i] is anywhere in B?
[16:30:31] <booger> hey guys if i have two arrays of objects and i want to check to see if one object, from array A has an identical object in array B how would i do that?.... i tried B.indexOf(A[i]); after doing for (var i=0; i < A.length; i++)
[16:32:45] <eip56> javascript object array notation is confusing as f*ck
[16:32:47] <imsky> hay guise!
[16:33:14] <ansolas> i love json
[16:33:39] <booger> eip56: yeah im looking for anything in JQuery that can help but i keep getting results that the objects don't match each other when i KNOW they match each other
[16:33:48] <booger> ansolas: JSON is cool yes i agree
[16:34:14] <samholmes> which is faster $('.class').not($excludeList).each(fun...) where $excludeList is a list built up over time, or is it just faster to loop through all $('.class').each(fun..)??
[16:36:20] <imsky> the first one obviously
[16:36:27] <imsky> you're iterating over a smaller list
[16:36:37] <shoky> doesn't .not iterate over the big list
[16:36:45] <imsky> yeah that's true
[16:36:47] <bailus> booger: obj === obj2 will only return true if they both refer to the same memory location
[16:36:50] <imsky> but what if his .each takes 50 ms
[16:36:51] <shoky> so you get 2 loops instead of 1
[16:37:04] <shoky> it wouldn't
[16:37:09] <imsky> how do you know
[16:37:18] <shoky> if first thing he does is check the exclude list
[16:37:18] <imsky> he'd be reimplementing .not in .each anyway, with a conditional
[16:37:35] <imsky> lolwat
[16:37:39] <booger> bailus: how would i check to see if the object === obj2 knowing both objects are in an array, and both objects are arrays?
[16:37:41] <shoky> i mean, i assumed that's what he meant in his 2nd case
[16:37:50] <imsky> no u cant read shoky pls go play xbox
[16:37:59] <shoky> hmm wat
[16:38:28] <shoky> no exclude list in the 2nd alternative?
[16:38:36] <imsky> no
[16:38:54] <bailus> you need to loop through all the properties to check that they're equal
[16:39:18] <booger> ah ok
[16:39:18] <anthonysessa> @booger Javascript does not overload the === operation allowing you to compare objects.
[16:39:27] <anthonysessa> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1068834/object-comparison-in-javascript
[16:39:53] <bailus> underscore has an isEqual function that compares objects
[16:39:53] <imsky> objects are pass by reference dammit
[16:40:22] <anthonysessa> underscore ftw
[16:40:24] <booger> bailus: i was checking underscore but maybe thats the road i need to go down
[16:41:32] <booger> underscore also has the _.differece but that seems to only work with strict strings or values... i do a run through of one object in the array and run it throught the entire array each time but there isn't a better way?
[16:42:05] <imsky> booger, how about serializing the object to json and comparing strings?
[16:42:17] <imsky> CANT GO WRONG THERE
[16:42:21] <anthonysessa> haha
[16:42:36] <anthonysessa> first time in this channel, already likin it
[16:42:36] <booger> :P
[16:43:02] <booger> thanks guys i think i can try to figure it out from here
[16:47:37] <eip56> Anyone have any good links to help me understand when where and why I should use object array notation over dot syntax?
[16:47:58] <imsky> lol
[16:48:09] <imsky> you should use it as much as possible
[16:48:12] <imsky> for multiple reasons
[16:48:29] <imsky> a.property will assume "property" of a already exists
[16:48:36] <imsky> a["property"] wpn't
[16:48:57] <imsky> you also can't do a.variableproperty, but you can do a[variableproperty]
[16:49:27] <rgenito> hello jquery world :D
[16:49:38] <imsky> hello rgenito you sexy baboon
[16:49:41] <tra_> imsky: so will a.varprop give an undefined and a[varprop] not?
[16:49:45] <bailus> but a.variableproperty is easier to read
[16:49:45] <rgenito> hehe
[16:49:50] <imsky> tra_ not even. a.varprop will just crash
[16:49:57] <imsky> it'll give you an exception
[16:50:00] <rgenito> when someone selects a checkbox on my site, i want to make a div show() when that happens
[16:50:06] <tra_> ok cool, didn't know this :)
[16:50:30] <imsky> dot notation basically acts on "compile time", when the js is loaded
[16:50:45] <imsky> so if you have a.text = "hello", a["text"] and a.text are both available when you load the page
[16:50:58] <rgenito> what's the way to do that now? my knowledge of "javascript" is very old school, but i'm guessing it's $('#checkboxId').change(function() { if ($(this).val()) { // make div show, else hide } }); ?
[16:51:04] <bailus> > ({}).prop
[16:51:04] <bailus> undefined
[16:51:09] <bailus> no errors :P
[16:51:12] <imsky> but if you assign a.text later, after load, a.text won't be available on load
[16:52:10] <imsky> rgenito, even easier. function(){$("div").toggle($(this).val())}
[16:52:23] <rgenito> wtf?! toggle???
[16:52:27] <imsky> yeah baby
[16:52:42] <rgenito> lemme try that out....
[16:53:21] <rhizmoe> i have a modal (jqModal) that is flowing past the bottom edge of the viewport. how can i get a scrollbar to show up?
[16:53:46] <rgenito> imsky: oh crap nevermind... i forgot: it's a form's "disable" attribute that i want to toggle; not div hide/show
[16:53:52] <imsky> NO PROB
[16:54:02] <imsky> $("form").prop("disabled", $(this).val())
[16:54:37] <rgenito> wow, you're like... the king of jquery solutions :D
[16:55:02] <imsky> i stand on the shoulders of giants
[16:55:05] <imsky> giants and midgets
[16:55:06] <rgenito> lol
[16:55:37] <rgenito> btw, how would i know ".val()" was an attribute of $(this) ? i tried console logging $(this) previously, and i got a list of the html elements. (or a list of SOMETHING that looked like html)
[16:56:14] <imsky> $(this) just refers to the jQuery wrapped DOM element
[16:56:18] <imsky> .val() is a jquery function
[16:56:18] <b-ot> imsky, memorised “val()”.
[16:56:24] <imsky> NOOOOOo
[16:56:26] <imsky> ?val()
[16:56:28] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[16:56:34] <imsky> man so many bots
[16:57:16] <darkfrog> how do I query an element by name?
[16:57:50] <darkfrog> $('#byid') works, but how about for a form element by name?
[16:58:00] <rgenito> darkfrog i think it's [name=name_here]
[16:58:01] <bailus> $('[name=foo]')
[16:58:46] <darkfrog> ah, nice. :)
[16:58:50] <rgenito> imsky when the checkbox is "checked", my goal will be to enable 2 form fields
[16:58:52] <darkfrog> thanks guys. :)
[16:59:07] <rgenito> inside my checkbox's "changed" event, i have: $('#endDate').prop('disabled', $(this).val() == 'on' ? 'enabled' : 'disabled');
[16:59:11] <rgenito> lol. not working... helppp ;(
[16:59:14] <imsky> rgenito, no prob $("#field1, #field2").prop("disabled", $(this).prop("checked"))
[16:59:33] <rgenito> imsky: wait, wont that DISABLE my input fields?
[16:59:39] <rgenito> i dont want to disable them... i want to enable them
[16:59:44] <rgenito> (by default they are disabled)
[16:59:44] <imsky> maybe, try fiddling with the boolean logic
[17:00:03] <rgenito> i mean, what should the property "disabled' be equal to, if the form field is not disabled?
[17:00:10] <rgenito> false? 'false'? 0?
[17:00:21] <imsky> false
[17:00:48] <rgenito> ty :)
[17:01:25] <rgenito> yay :D
[17:01:26] <rgenito> $('#endDate, #endTime').prop('disabled', !$(this).val());
[17:01:29] <rgenito> that works :D
[17:01:29] <eip56> imsky would you mind taking a look at this. the first object was my first attempt and the reference to the property would not resolve the second object i used the object array notation and it worked. I guess im just confused why the first would not resolve correctly
[17:01:34] <eip56> http://hastebin.com/wibumovesi.js
[17:01:41] <rgenito> however, that's iffy...hehe
[17:03:22] <imsky> eip56, why are you writing e.container.e
[17:03:28] <imsky> that doesn't even make sense
[17:03:39] <imsky> container isn't an object with an e property
[17:03:48] <coldhead> it has nice symmetry
[17:04:13] <eip56> well its just a simplified version but in the long run i stored the reference to the container that i will be working with
[17:04:30] <gza_> i am trying to animate an image so it fades on :hover and overlays an image. I just dont want to bother with the plugins
[17:04:33] <eip56> there will be a hide show alter function so instead of diving into the pool everytime i saved it as a property
[17:04:53] <gza_> can anyone help
[17:05:08] <eip56> so the init function just fades it in using the var to the container then the var to the effect
[17:05:12] <imsky> eip56, array notation in that case will definitely not work
[17:05:16] <eip56> in the long run the config: will have several
[17:05:17] <rgenito> gza_ paste some code?
[17:05:18] <imsky> you're using variable properties
[17:05:21] <gza_> sure
[17:05:29] <rgenito> changes are that if plugins do those things.. then maybe it isn't so simple doing it yourself
[17:05:38] <rgenito> which i'm sure is obvious to ya
[17:05:48] <rgenito> but ya, i think people will love to see a link of code :D
[17:06:23] <rgenito> ok i'm having a BIG problem...
[17:06:34] <rgenito> i am catching my checkbox's value during the change event: $('#noEndDate').change(function() {
[17:06:42] <rgenito> however, $(this).val() is ALWAYS 'on" :(
[17:06:50] <rgenito> i should do something else it seems... any suggestions?
[17:08:15] <eip56> imsky so i cannot chain variable properties together is where im failing?
[17:08:21] <imsky> pretty much
[17:08:34] <eip56> ok i understand a littlebit better
[17:08:49] <imsky> you're requesting something like {container: {e:{config:{effect:""}}}}
[17:09:10] <eip56> is that why i have to use the array notation because i cant chain to variable properties
[17:10:20] <imsky> pretty much
[17:10:32] <imsky> that and when you're doing e.container.e, you expect e.container to have an "e" property
[17:10:35] <gza_> http://jsfiddle.net/u9cEu/ - instead of opacity i just want to use a black overlay image but still animate on and off
[17:10:42] <imsky> think of dot notation as the array notation in quotes eip56
[17:10:47] <imsky> so e.container == e["container"]
[17:11:02] <imsky> so you can't do e.container.e and mean e.container[e], it means e.container["e"]
[17:13:31] <eip56> perfect that was the explanation i was looking for... THanks imsky you just cured a few weeks of frustration trying to understand something
[17:13:39] <imsky> np eip56
[17:14:23] <klocatelli> Is it possible to alter a css3 animation duration once it's started?
[17:15:04] <imsky> nope
[17:15:13] <klocatelli> :(
[17:15:59] <gza_> can anyone help?
[17:16:07] <imsky> I CAN HELP YOU SIR
[17:16:28] <gza_> http://jsfiddle.net/u9cEu/ - instead of opacity i just want to use a black overlay image but still animate on and off
[17:16:52] <imsky> so what's the problem here sir
[17:17:30] <gza_> on hover i want to be able to display a black overlay image
[17:17:39] <imsky> ok so do it
[17:17:41] <gza_> is it possible to do without building a script
[17:17:44] <imsky> no
[17:18:05] <gza_> no?
[17:18:14] <imsky> naw playa nwa
[17:18:39] <Whirl3d> using css, you could, right?
[17:19:18] <gza_> i dont want to use any css3 since i want it to be cross compatible
[17:19:31] <Whirl3d> nvm then
[17:19:53] <Whirl3d> lemme see if I got this straight...no css3, no code, what about html? Do you plan to use html?
[17:20:14] <imsky> he plans to do it with telepathy
[17:20:15] <gza_> can you somehow add the css class like :hover and put add an background-image and then add the class to the jquery
[17:20:21] <Whirl3d> must be
[17:20:53] <gza_> what do you mean
[17:20:57] <gza_> i sent the link?
[17:21:04] * Whirl3d bows out less than gracefully--will defer the onslaught to imsky
[17:21:13] <imsky> THANKS FOR NOTHING
[17:21:33] <Whirl3d> imsky++ (I owe ya one)
[17:21:42] <imsky> lol Whirl3d++
[17:21:48] <Whirl3d> err, one more...
[17:23:45] <gza_> is 8 js files too many? i can add them into one file, right?
[17:24:13] <bailus> 8 isn't enough
[17:24:19] <gza_> lol
[17:24:24] <gza_> i cant even get a straight anwser yo
[17:24:39] <bailus> haha
[17:24:45] <gza_> brb stackoverflow..
[17:25:11] <bailus> for performance you should compress them and concatenate them all into one blob of text
[17:26:03] <gza_> yeah i figured but since i dont know jquery i rely on scripts which i've downloaded and just add them all in my head ending up with alot of files
[17:26:31] <gza_> i only see a few on other website sources
[17:27:09] <gza_> i dont know seperate files for each one do i? i can bind all the smaller scripts into one file?
[17:27:18] <gza_> need*
[17:28:41] <klocatelli> probably
[17:29:18] <gza_> one for cufon one for the font.js file one for easyslider one for pngfix one for a jquery form etc etc
[17:29:32] <gza_> so many
[17:29:47] <gza_> -_-
[17:30:32] <benth> we are using .load which works great but now i want to actually "load" a hidden div, what is the best way to do this?
[17:31:25] <imsky> load the hidden div man
[17:31:28] <imsky> don't be a pussy
[17:31:57] <gza_> lol
[17:32:16] <myrman> haha
[17:32:16] <gza_> display:none
[17:32:28] <gza_> :hover remove it
[17:40:44] <Breakbeat> Hey all.  I'm making a WP site.  I'd like to use the same features as this site.  Can anyone tell if the jquery plugins are what formats the layout of this site, or is it a WP/server side thing? http://softlabnyc.com/
[17:41:30] <someprimetime> that page has way too much damn overhead jesus christ
[17:41:52] <tw2113> Breakbeat hit "view-source" and start reading all the jQuery plugin links
[17:41:57] <someprimetime> are you in chrome?
[17:42:00] <someprimetime> click inspect element
[17:42:02] <someprimetime> then the sources tab
[17:42:11] <imsky> press f12 you noob
[17:42:18] <gza_> damn its slow
[17:42:36] <someprimetime> under wp-content/themes/squaregrid/js you can the tons of plugins they use
[17:42:38] <Breakbeat> yeah it has a ton of overhead
[17:42:39] <someprimetime> also: write your own
[17:42:41] <tw2113> easier to look at script links with view-source :P
[17:42:45] <imsky> haaaahahaha 7.6 MB for a website
[17:42:50] <gza_> woah
[17:43:06] <someprimetime> f12? what is this? windows?
[17:43:14] <imsky> you seem dumb
[17:43:15] <tw2113> f12 = firebug
[17:43:20] <Breakbeat> Yes, I see a bajillion scripts.  However, I do think that it's a PHP thing where the user sets the thumbnail size when they build a new post, not necessarily a jquery thing
[17:43:20] <imsky> f12 is dev tools
[17:43:35] <Breakbeat> PS, my site won't be this buttloaded with crap :)
[17:43:46] <gza_> you've got more scripts that me
[17:43:46] <someprimetime> f12 on a mac brings up my sound preferences
[17:43:47] <gza_> lol
[17:43:51] <gza_> than
[17:44:04] <Breakbeat> I just want a non-grid layout, on a wordpress site.  Thats my goal
[17:44:09] <imsky> ctrl shift i then, and make sure you learn how to use f12
[17:44:15] <imsky> mac users are noobs forever
[17:44:16] <Breakbeat> cool thanks
[17:44:28] <Breakbeat> f12 in Firefox with Firebug you mean?
[17:44:32] <imsky> no
[17:44:37] <Breakbeat> chrome?
[17:44:42] <imsky> ja
[17:44:55] <someprimetime> imsky: calm down
[17:45:04] <imsky> i aint even mad tho
[17:45:51] <tw2113> joo mad?

[17:58:08] <azbyin> can someone tell me why clicking on the button does nothing after the textarea has been "touched" ?
[17:58:28] <azbyin> i.e. it works fine if nothing has been manually entered into the testarea
[17:58:39] <azbyin> *textarea

[18:13:24] <imsky> and the time of our lives
[18:15:47] <hobs_> as we fall asleep in each other's arms, they slowly push us out to sea with the other whales, and we awake to the dawn breaking over an infinite horizon of water
[18:15:54] <hobs_> we close our eyes one last time

[18:17:52] <myrman> does closing your eyes one last time mean you won't ever open them, or that you'll keep them open for the rest of your life?
[18:18:05] <imsky> if you open them for the rest of your life, it's gonna be a short life
[18:18:14] <imsky> so you'll eventually die looking very alert
[18:18:37] <myrman> at least you'll be together

[18:54:13] <phonebook_> yeah thats pretty true
[18:54:21] <phonebook_> but the domain is great
[18:54:33] <imsky> lol what an optimist
[18:56:10] <phonebook_> if i were an optimist my code would look like this: while(true) { if(doSomething()==false) break;  }... and i think we all know the problem with THAT
[18:56:55] <imsky> yes, the problem is doSomething is undefined
[18:57:03] <imsky> so this thing will break immediately
[19:06:22] <phonebook_> serioulsy though, i am working on a stock application that is heavy on jquery... will share code if anyone wants to participate dateequa.w07.wh-2.com
[19:06:33] <phonebook_> obviously some of the calculations are a little fracked
[19:17:33] <phonebook_> i guess sitting back and drinking beers while you earn interest like a champion is too cool for everyone... thats fine
[19:18:13] <imsky> i earn interest like a champ
[19:22:22] <innociv> ?eval test
[19:22:24] <bot-t> innociv: ReferenceError: test is not defined
[19:27:59] <martisj> is there a method to clear a form quickly with jquery?
[19:31:05] <imsky> form.reset()
[19:31:09] <imsky> no jquery here
[19:38:28] <martisj> alright thanks imsky
[19:38:34] <imsky> yw
[20:03:25] <martisj> form.reset() does that reset all forms on the page?
[20:04:22] <stan_man_can> Is there any way to download the jquery docs?
[20:05:53] <phonebook_> idk if it does but a jquery alternative might be $(*).val("");
[20:06:11] <phonebook_> it would probably work within 50ms of the dom solution
[20:07:50] <Bankzilla> stan_man_can: http://www.jqapi.com/
[20:09:38] <martisj> it's going to take 50ms longer ?
[20:09:47] <phonebook_> topsish
[20:10:06] <phonebook_> i mean the dom solution is probably right - except the jquery solution probably works on all browsers
[20:10:28] <phonebook_> and you might have to do something other than .val for checkboxes and selects etc
[20:10:39] <phonebook_> radios...
[20:10:41] <phonebook_> like this...
[20:11:25] <phonebook_> i might not remember some html right so i dont want to be humiliated...
[20:11:33] <stan_man_can> Bankzilla: awesome thanks. Hopefully I can finish getting the php docs up and running locally and I'll be good to go while on vacaiton
[20:11:35] <stan_man_can>  
[20:11:37] <stan_man_can> vacation*
[20:13:16] <phonebook_> $.each($("input, textarea, select, radio"), function() { $(this.val(""); $(this).removeAttr("selected"); $(this).removeAttr("checked");  }); ...etc
[20:13:38] <phonebook_> also... on jqm and jquery ui you might have to do a refresh or some painful cloning
[20:16:32] <martisj> phonebook_: thanks :)
[20:16:36] <martisj> i found an article on it
[20:16:39] <martisj> http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/08/clearing-form-data
[20:17:24] <martisj> is there a way to get the dom equivalent of a jquery object i.e. document.forms[the_id_of_the_form_from_jquery]>
[20:20:27] <martisj> nvm
[20:20:41] <martisj> i used the plugin method from the article.
[20:20:41] <martisj> sweet
[20:23:37] <HEMI> So what does var $cell = $(cell); accomplish? Just convert cell into something jQuery can work with, or...
[20:23:44] <phonebook_> $("myObj")[0]
[20:23:46] <phonebook_> or
[20:23:58] <phonebook_> $("myObj").get();
[20:24:09] <phonebook_> both return the dom object
[20:24:37] <HEMI> I see. That's how it can pull attributes from the object after that point.
[20:25:26] <phonebook_> var is = $cell.attr("id")
[20:25:29] <phonebook_> *id
[20:25:35] <phonebook_> im fucking bored
[20:25:51] <phonebook_> everyone either hates me here or is to pretentious to talk about anythign interesting
[20:25:54] <phonebook_> boot me please
[20:26:18] <HEMI> Right. I'm using it that way now in the tablesorter parser I wrote. Just wanted to understand why they were doing the $cell = $(cell);.
[20:26:24] <HEMI> I've got another one for you if you're interested...
[20:26:31] <HEMI> jQuery tablesorter parser again...
[20:26:37] <HEMI>         format: function(s, table, cell, cellIndex) {
[20:26:47] <phonebook_> the $ in front of the variable name just hints that it is a jquery object... its only for human readability
[20:27:15] <HEMI> I'm not using s, table or cellIndex...I'm guessing I still need them in the function call? It's something that the tablesorter parser sends to the function...
[20:27:40] <phonebook_> is this homework?
[20:27:48] <HEMI> No.
[20:27:49] <phonebook_> pls be honest because i sense a lot of people doing homework on here
[20:27:58] <phonebook_> how is that not homework? its totally fine with me
[20:28:15] <phonebook_> jquery is... whats it called ..loose typed - weak typed
[20:28:23] <HEMI> Something I'm writing for work...I'm doing it at home, mostly cause I am also bored...The documentation on the stuff for writing tablesorter parsers is somewhat sparse.
[20:28:25] <phonebook_> that is, javascript is, ecma is
[20:28:42] <phonebook_> ie you can send those variables but if you dont use them its not a problem
[20:29:12] <phonebook_> like in a storngly typed langauge like c# or java or c++ you would need to overload the method
[20:29:20] <HEMI> I want to understand why they're sometimes only using s (for the contents of the cell) in the function in the parser, but other times listing all four of them, even if they don't use table or cell...I'm guessing it's just the order things are done in and you can't get to cell without having s and table in front of it.
[20:29:25] <phonebook_> in javascript you can send whatever you want and check for existence
[20:29:31] <HEMI> Right.
[20:29:48] <phonebook_> its just easier is why
[20:30:00] <phonebook_> e.g.
[20:30:36] <phonebook_> idk
[20:30:48] <HEMI> Sorry if my questions seem a bit...Remedial...I'm just annoyed at the lack of good documentation for tablesorter.
[20:31:07] <phonebook_> especially in big functions
[20:31:17] <phonebook_> you might just get an options argument
[20:31:31] <phonebook_> where there could be 200 possibilities, and you might only use three
[20:31:35] <phonebook_> for example:
[20:31:53] <phonebook_> http://www.highcharts.com/ref/
[20:32:15] <phonebook_> its way easier to write one function and just check for existence than to write 700 functions and try to match up the logic
[20:32:44] <HEMI> Right.
[20:33:06] <phonebook_> get used to shitty documentation
[20:33:13] <phonebook_> check this out... i spent 3 hours on this today...
[20:33:22] <HEMI> In the last two days I've learned a ton about $.post(), JSON, tablesorter and all sorts of other fun things...
[20:33:53] <HEMI> Heh, that's one of OSS' major pitfalls: documentation. It's the pale white underbelly of the software-dev world, and since it's not fun or interesting lots of OSS people don't bother. :(
[20:33:56] <phonebook_> the very bottom - choose shippig method  - http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[20:34:01] <phonebook_> now look at this:
[20:34:37] <phonebook_> now on this one
[20:34:38] <phonebook_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all.html
[20:35:08] <phonebook_> the first link i posted is to the official current release of jquery mobile and one of the major controls is broke
[20:36:05] <HEMI> QA/RE: another major pitfall of open-source software. :(
[20:36:16] <HEMI> Again, another one of those un-glamorous areas.
[20:36:40] <phonebook_> its everywhere
[20:36:58] <phonebook_> but i dont want to rant... i could.. totally could go on about 30 different apis etc
[20:37:06] <HEMI> I think QA/RE and documentation crappiness is less prevalent in commercial software development.
[20:37:11] <phonebook_> but people tend to hate me when i do that.....
[20:37:25] <HEMI> Mostly cause people can get fired if stuff is broken on release.
[20:37:44] <HEMI> ...Unless they work for Apple, in the Server group...Then they keep cramming more shit in a smaller bag.
[20:39:03] <HEMI> Anyway, I'm surprised all this stuff works right.
[20:39:36] <HEMI> My only problem right at the moment is fixing a performance issue...I'm calling .update() every time something writes a row to the tablesorter table, and I'm sure that's KILLING everything...
[20:39:46] <HEMI> There's apparently a .addRows() method, but I have yet to get it to work right.
[20:40:28] <phonebook_> usually no one in here knows anything about a particular api
[20:41:44] <phonebook_> allright, HEMI, good luck. i wish i could help more. everyone - if you ever see me in here again pls tell me to shoot myself or uninstall icechat as this always end up a horrible and boring waste of time
[20:42:00] <phonebook_> dramatic exit in... i--
[20:42:09] <HEMI> phonebook_: thanks for your help...
[20:42:20] <HEMI> Sorry I wasn't more entertaining. :|
[20:42:47] <phonebook_> no man not you, thank you for trying to stop me from killing myself
[20:43:03] <HEMI> Well, don't kill yourself. Life sucks at times, but the good times are worth the bad.
[20:43:27] <phonebook_> good advice, im out
[20:44:43] <imsky> who almost killed themselves?
[20:44:49] <imsky> WHY DIDNT YOU GO THROUGH WITH IT
[20:44:55] <abjorn> :o

[20:48:22] <imsky> chit man i donno
[20:48:34] <imsky> solving problems, buying groceries
[20:48:36] <abjorn> chit
[20:48:45] <imsky> summer's windin down
[20:49:12] <imsky> i've been reading about this chick fil a thing
[20:49:46] <abjorn> why
[20:49:47] <imsky> and how some dude got fired after posting a vid of himself going to chick fil a
[20:50:09] <abjorn> that's just ridiculous
[20:50:17] <imsky> lol it's hilarious though
[20:50:45] <imsky> this guy was all like "pfft pwnin u chick fil a hatemongarz" and then the same day, his company shitcanned him
[20:51:11] <imsky> he was cfo of it too, which is just lol
[20:54:12] <martisj> how do i target a button created inside of a jquery ui dialog?
[20:54:21] <imsky> you say a lil prayer
[20:54:29] <martisj> imsky: alright :)
[20:54:31] <martisj> that's sweet :)
[20:54:41] <imsky> happy to oblige my sweet
[20:54:58] <martisj> console.log(buttons("SendInvitation")); ?
[20:55:03] <imsky> lolwut
[20:55:29] <imsky> what are you doing with these buttons
[20:56:23] <martisj> i just want to disable the button so the user can't send a million emails in a second via ajax :)
[20:57:07] <imsky> ok so bind something on the open event
[20:57:14] <imsky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#event-open
[20:57:20] <martisj> bind them to what?
[20:57:24] <martisj> toggle button?
[20:57:26] <imsky> lolwut
[20:57:36] <martisj> lolwut
[20:57:43] <imsky> u seem irritable
[20:57:46] <imsky> and possibly dumb
[20:58:16] <martisj> not irritable, dumb might be the case .
[20:58:40] <imsky> ok so bind a handler that disables your buttons on open, at some point
[20:59:05] <martisj> i want them to be disable after the user has clicked it once.
[20:59:19] <imsky> ok so on the open event, find the buttons, and bind a click event to them
[20:59:30] <martisj> yeah i have done that
[20:59:38] <imsky> you're 99% of the way there brother
[21:00:51] <martisj> $(this) is referencing the dialog itself, eventhough i am calling console.log($(this)) from inside the click function.
[21:02:02] <martisj> imsky: just realised that I'm not binding the open method, I'm using the buttons: {} parameter.
[21:02:19] <imsky> getting better brother
[21:03:43] <martisj> woo hooooooooo ;)
[21:04:48] <martisj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#option-buttons
[21:04:57] <martisj> using the getter here gets me almost there :)
[21:07:45] <martisj> how do i get a specific object from the object notation
[21:08:40] <imsky> do what now
[21:10:42] <abjorn> o.0
[21:13:19] <martisj> the buttons getter returns an object literal with 2 objs inside, cancel and sendinvitation. i want to get the sendinvitation one.
[21:13:21] <martisj> how ?
[21:13:22] <martisj> :)
[21:13:52] <abjorn> you should learn javascript, it might help
[21:13:55] <abjorn> obj.sendinvitation
[21:14:11] <imsky> im drinking organic carbonated lemonade
[21:17:03] <martisj> hehehehe abjorn jepp
[21:17:07] <martisj> imsky: tasty
[21:17:12] <imsky> it sho is
[21:18:41] <martisj> and if it has been defined like so:  {buttons: { "Send Invitation" : {//options and stuff here} }}  obj."Send Invitation"
[21:18:42] <martisj> ?
[21:19:00] <imsky> obj["Send Invitation"]
[21:19:05] <imsky> but lol at that definition
[21:19:56] <martisj> lol
[21:23:27] <HEMI> So, say I've got a frame that's got a tablesorter table I want to trigger the .update method for, but I need to do it from another frame. How should I go about calling that? I'm not having much luck...
[21:26:43] <azbyin> will    $("This is a <button>button!</button>")  work as expected?
[21:27:05] <azbyin> err..     $("This is a <button>button!</button>").appendTo("body")
[21:27:19] <azbyin> it appears to append the button without the text
[21:28:46] <HEMI> azbyin: no.
[21:29:06] <azbyin> how do I get the text in? should i create some form of "text" node?
[21:29:29] <HEMI> Do you already have the button created? if so, just modify the .attrs of the button.
[21:29:43] <azbyin> HEMI, you will notice that there is text before the button!
[21:29:55] <azbyin> ofcourse one could use the css selectors to append before
[21:30:06] <azbyin> no, the button is created now
[21:30:11] <azbyin> it is not pre existing
[21:31:03] <azbyin> $("This is a ").appendTo("body"); $("<button>button!</button>").appendTo("body"); ?
[21:31:20] <HEMI> azbyin: yes, I noticed there's text before the button. It's apparently not wrapped in anything.
[21:31:57] <azbyin> yes. and i am appending it to something else.. not really directly to the body
[21:33:18] <azbyin> basically, i want this structure: <div id="id1"> <img id="id2"/> <div id="id3">This is a <button>button!</button></div></div>
[21:33:30] <azbyin> and i want to append div id1 to the body
[21:33:37] <HEMI> http://api.jquery.com/append/ <-- A good example.
[21:36:11] <azbyin> HEMI, none of those examples were appending something that was a combination of simple text and an html element
[21:37:17] <azbyin> (i) appends some html to all paras (ii) appends an element to all paras (iii) appends a jquery object to all paras
[21:37:18] <HEMI> So create an element to contain your text. Append that. Then append the button to the same thing.
[21:37:35] <HEMI> Note: a div is not a container for raw text. You need to wrap it in a <p> or some other text container.
[21:37:35] <azbyin> but that will create an extra element!
[21:46:11] <azbyin> HEMI, i just tried a sample testcase on the w3c validator. and it says it validates successfully as html5
[21:48:07] <HEMI> Funny.
[21:48:37] <azbyin> although it does say 2 warnings and does *not* show these warnings to me!
[21:48:47] <azbyin> i'll paste on paste site
[21:50:30] <azbyin> HEMI, pastebin.ca/2177018   you can paste the code here: http://validator.w3.org/check  in the direct input tab
[21:51:24] <HEMI> Sorry, I'm troubeshooting my own stuff right now. Just about got tonight's problem licked.
[21:51:33] <azbyin> no worries..
[21:53:44] <HEMI> Think I got 'er figured out. It's fast. It's pretty. It sorts right.
[21:57:44] <thomedy> is there any other rooms besides javascript that deal in js without a frame work
[21:57:49] <thomedy> i dont want to abuse this room
[21:57:53] <thomedy> but i need help
[22:30:36] <trewd6> hey guys i have the name of an html element in a variable, how can I hide it? is there like an eval function? $('#' + data.result.name).hide();
[22:32:01] <HEMI> You might need .attr("hidden","hidden").
[22:32:20] <HEMI> But yes, that selector should work.
[22:33:10] <Haprog> that wil select by id though because of '#'
[22:33:12] <Haprog> *will
[22:33:28] <HEMI> True...I generally assume that people mean id when they say name. :|
[22:33:41] <HEMI> Cause it seems like names are annoying to select on sometimes.
[22:34:16] <Haprog> if you actually want to select by name attribute do $('[name='+ myname +']')
[22:36:26] <trewd6> HEMI:
[22:36:28] <trewd6> Haprog:
[22:36:46] <trewd6> if id's have dots in them will that still work?
[22:36:58] <Haprog> mm.. probably not
[22:37:23] <HEMI> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4247840/what-are-legal-characters-for-an-html-element-id
[22:37:27] <Haprog> it shouldn't be a valid id if it has dots
[22:37:49] <HEMI> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/70579/what-are-valid-values-for-the-id-attribute-in-html
[22:38:07] <HEMI> So, in short, "technically" you can do it, but don't be surprised if stuff chokes.
[22:38:29] <HEMI> As noted in other responses, jQuery has problems with ids that contain periods and colons.
[22:38:32] <HEMI> So don't do it.
[22:39:16] <Haprog> You'll probably have CSS selector problems even without using jQuery if you try to use dots/periods in IDs.
[22:39:54] <HEMI> Right.
[22:55:44] <mast3rpyr0> heyo
