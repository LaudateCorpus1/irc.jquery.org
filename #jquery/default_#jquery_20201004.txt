[00:26:33] <kevr> i'm using $.ajax to make a delete request, the delete request works and returns a 302, then i try to run location.reload(true); inside of the done handler and it attempts to reload the current page with the DELETE method, instead of GET
[00:27:16] <robertmaxrees> can you show the code?
[00:28:19] <kevr> http://sprunge.us/RmYabu?js
[00:28:39] <robertmaxrees> lol my av is blocking that domain apparently.
[00:28:59] <kevr> interesting
[00:29:09] <robertmaxrees> mind using bpaste or jsfiddle or something else?
[00:33:15] <kevr> it's literally just an ajax delete request, and in .done(() => { location.reload(true); })
[00:33:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[00:33:57] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't do that since location.reload() basically mimics the browser refresh button
[00:34:11] <kevr> indeed
[00:34:13] <kevr> that's the intent
[00:34:42] <robertmaxrees> and that's all it does.  i'd have to see the rest of the relevant code to see if it's potentially something else causing the issue.
[00:34:58] <kevr> there's no other relevant part of the code
[00:35:08] <robertmaxrees> so no submit handlers or anything>?
[00:35:11] <kevr> it's just a button that has onclick= to a function, and all that function does is make an ajax request
[00:35:18] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[00:35:19] <kevr> well, it also asks for window.confirm
[00:35:30] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: weird.
[00:35:36] <robertmaxrees> wonder what's up then.
[00:35:39] <kevr> hmm..
[00:36:02] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't put all the code up on jsfiddle or some other paste service?
[00:37:28] <kevr> yeah, because i just want to put a snippet in bpaste for you, but it's saying that the cli tool only ever takes an entire file, and sprunge is just a service that hosts text or binary data that people can upload to it. i really don't feel like going through the extra steps, i'm kind of tired.
[00:37:41] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[00:37:43] <robertmaxrees> sorry then.
[00:37:53] <kevr> all good.
[00:39:19] <robertmaxrees> wonder why nod32 sees that as a malicious domain.
[00:39:45] <kevr> some probably uploaded some virus as binary data at some point
[00:39:55] <kevr> and perhaps someone on windows somehow downloaded an infectious file
[00:40:26] <robertmaxrees> also happens when there're other vulnerable/malicious code.  it flagged one of my domains once.
[00:40:34] <kevr> ;o
[00:42:07] <robertmaxrees> so i grabbed the file - i'd be interested in the html as well, since the js itself isn't an issue.
[00:45:25] <kevr> robertmaxrees: it's in a jinja2 template being rendered through flask: http://sprunge.us/p97ki6?html
[00:45:29] <kevr> particularly, the appReject buttoln
[00:45:32] <kevr> button*
[00:45:34] <robertmaxrees> is that the rendered html?
[00:45:37] <robertmaxrees> or the template?
[00:45:40] <kevr> it's the template
[00:45:45] <robertmaxrees> i need the rendered html.
[00:45:53] <robertmaxrees> since that's what the js interacts with.
[00:46:53] <kevr> sec
[00:47:34] <robertmaxrees> even better - can just stick the js and html on https://jsfiddle.net/ so i can play with it there.
[00:48:03] <kevr> https://gist.github.com/kevr/78b39a7c4f674a996ec4499c75c8d55d
[00:48:06] <kevr> can you view this?
[00:48:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[00:49:19] <robertmaxrees> any reason you're binding listeners in markup btw
[00:49:19] <robertmaxrees> ?
[00:50:14] <kevr> nah, i was just hacking it up to just see the basics work
[00:50:50] <kevr> i guess i could bind with jquery, but should that really make a difference here?
[00:51:30] <robertmaxrees> more of just a code cleanliness thing.  kind of like why you stick your scripts in a js file and load that file instead of inline script tags.
[00:51:51] <robertmaxrees> do you have the same issue with your appApprove function?
[00:53:29] <kevr> that one isn't fully implemented in the backend yet, so i can't test it right now.
[00:54:01] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  wasn't sure if you'd just stubbed out the endpoint for testing or not.
[00:54:33] <robertmaxrees> out of curiosity, how do you know the page is getting reloaded via a DELETE request?
[00:55:54] <kevr> through network requests + console. first, the ajax request is run and i get a 302 from that, with the /applicants/<id>?next=/dashboard, following that i get a 405 from /dashboard when it tries to load it via DELETE
[00:56:23] <kevr> if i comment out location.reload, that never occurs
[00:56:59] <robertmaxrees> where are you seeing that verb though?  as apart of the headers for that request in the network tab?
[00:57:20] <kevr> i see the requests that the frontend is making on my flask server cli output
[00:57:30] <kevr> but
[00:57:32] <kevr> console is showing
[00:57:33] <robertmaxrees> i might check to see what the browser says is happening.
[00:57:35] <kevr> the 405 failed delete
[00:58:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd also wonder if it's something to do with passing that deprecated 'true' arg.
[00:58:55] <kevr> i tried it without as well, same thing happened.
[00:59:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm, yeah, i'd check to see what the browser says is happening then.
[00:59:17] <kevr> sec, trying to get network log going again.. i just clicked something that screwed it up
[00:59:30] <robertmaxrees> what browser are you using?
[00:59:59] <kevr> chrome
[01:00:30] <kevr> yeah, so
[01:00:38] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  then yeah, i dunno - maybe bootstrap is doing something weird?  might be worth it spinning up another page with just the button and the specific function and start going from there.
[01:00:53] <kevr> same thing happens in the network log, if i look through headers, first the original ajax endpoint is requested with delete, succeeds and returns a 302
[01:01:14] <kevr> next network action immediately after is a DELETE sent to /dashboard and a 405 from that, because the server doesn't allow DELETE to that route
[01:01:30] <robertmaxrees> strange.  never seen that happen before.
[01:01:34] <kevr> :<
[01:03:10] <kevr> hm
[01:04:43] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:12:01] <kevr> thanks for takin a look, i appreciate it. i'll try to repro it in a smaller simple setup.
[03:47:25] <kevr> robertmaxrees: it was due to following a redirect from the original delete response
[03:48:08] <kevr> the server sends a redirect back to the next parameter after it's finished, the browser automatically tries to go and it caused an error because it wasn't supported
[03:48:26] <kevr> just running location.reload on a 405 fixes the issue, but it feels a little hacky
[16:12:28] <sydbarret> Where i have to add  code when submitting the form? this is what im using http://w3schools-fa.ir/howto/howto_js_form_steps.html. In other words I need to add this code when submitting https://bpa.st/T5SQ
[18:44:39] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[20:50:57] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret that's not a jquery question
[21:20:36] <sydbarret> robert i have a tooth decay, is it safe to go to dentist?
[21:21:38] <sydbarret> haha
