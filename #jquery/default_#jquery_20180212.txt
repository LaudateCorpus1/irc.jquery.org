[05:26:17] <mgathala> one of my code works only setTimeout
[05:26:18] <mgathala> why?
[05:26:38] <mgathala> here is code sample
[05:26:39] * devi8 consults my crystal ball---
[05:26:39] <mgathala> setTimeout(function () {         $(".ctools-collapsible-container >.ctools-collapsible-handle", context).one('click', function(){           $(this).siblings('.ctools-collapsible-content').find('.expandable-field').each(function(){             Drupal.behaviors.my_function($(this));           });         });       }, 2000);
[05:26:54] <devi8> !paste
[05:27:28] <devi8> paste your code to jsfiddle or codepen so we can look at it. Don't paste code in irc, please
[05:33:35] <mgathala> https://jsfiddle.net/e4xdsc39/
[06:28:20] <devi8> mgathala, without the related html/css, how do you expect someone to help you? I mean, sure you pasted your code, but without context, it doesn't really help.
[06:28:52] <AdamPDotty> there is a variable named context :-)
[06:29:05] <devi8> very cute...8)
[06:29:25] <devi8> mgathala, have you tried logging to console to see if the function is firing?
[06:34:42] <mgathala> thanks, let me check in console
[07:20:03] <Cork> the answer to that one is most likely that it runs before the element exists
[07:59:49] <lissitzki> hello
[08:03:25] <lissitzki> in this menu, clicking Menu B>Submenu should hide link-1 and link-2
[08:03:28] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/6/
[08:03:38] <lissitzki> cannot achieve it
[08:10:45] <AdamPDotty> still so much going on there
[08:11:02] <AdamPDotty> You do not need javascript for a drop down menu.
[08:11:14] <Woet> i think i've seen that code for like 2 months now
[08:11:22] <AdamPDotty> you do not need classes to describe the structure that is already given by tags
[08:11:49] <Woet> 2017-12-11.txt:[2017-12-11T20:09:27+0800] <lissitzki> hi, I've been asked to create a menu like this: http://www.irb-paris.eu, can you just give me some suggestion for taking a direction?
[08:11:52] <Woet> 2 months and 1 day
[08:11:52] <Woet> nice
[08:12:35] <AdamPDotty> in most cases .css(9 is not a good idea, same for .click()
[08:13:20] <AdamPDotty> Next: What should happen, when you click a sub menu item?
[08:13:32] <localh0st> lissitzki: that menu is just terrible IMHO
[08:13:51] <Woet> localh0st: don't mock 2 months of their work
[08:14:02] <localh0st> :P
[08:14:37] <lissitzki> AdamPDotty, submenu item is link to other pages
[08:17:30] <AdamPDotty> In that case, you should not care manually about clicks to it.
[08:20:26] <lissitzki> AdamPDotty, jquery seems useful for a dropdown menu with clcik not with hover
[08:21:20] <AdamPDotty> after click you are not on the same page anymore
[08:21:40] <AdamPDotty> or you mean top level click
[08:21:44] <lissitzki> yes
[08:21:49] <lissitzki> for the top level
[08:22:10] <AdamPDotty> ok, still all that should do is set an active class there.
[08:24:05] <lissitzki> yup that is made
[08:25:01] <AdamPDotty> there is literally not one class in the markup that is useful.
[08:25:15] <lissitzki> i mean a php script is managing an active class for the active page,
[08:25:20] <undefined_bob> dont worry lissitzki I'm working on my project for almost 7 month now :D
[08:25:45] <lissitzki> ;)
[08:25:54] <lissitzki> perseverance
[08:26:10] <undefined_bob> and there is still a flaw in the jQ code ^^
[08:26:51] <lissitzki> AdamPDotty, '-_-
[08:27:16] <lissitzki> that's was the best i could do
[08:27:39] <undefined_bob> but if people at work ask me why I need so much time, I always say "its not my fault, I'm forced to work on a windows xp machine"
[08:29:03] <lissitzki> well my excuse is that is my first jquery project.
[08:29:17] <lissitzki> probably useless
[08:29:26] <lissitzki> eh
[08:30:01] <lissitzki> whatever
[08:31:30] <undefined_bob> ya I know that feel
[08:32:17] <AdamPDotty> four <ul>s open three close ...
[08:35:15] <lissitzki> i closed it
[08:38:46] <AdamPDotty> I just cleaned up a bit. Maybe start here: https://jsfiddle.net/2tzpr84v/8/
[08:38:59] <AdamPDotty> Then think, what you want to do. It is not that hard.
[08:42:45] <lissitzki> AdamPDotty, i'm grateful
[08:49:18] <AdamPDotty> Now just formulate your thought and then translate them into css.
[08:55:14] <lissitzki> well i should reproduce the same process but some level deeper
[08:57:50] <AdamPDotty> "one level deeper" can translate as easily as " li ", so you might get "nav li li:not(.active) li {"
[08:58:56] <lissitzki> on jquery side the selector should be one level deeper as well
[08:59:02] <lissitzki> actually two
[08:59:18] <lissitzki> nav > li > ul > li
[08:59:28] <lissitzki> isnt' it?
[09:01:31] <lissitzki> no
[09:09:41] <AdamPDotty> the first > is wrong
[09:10:08] <AdamPDotty> you could go with nav > ul > li > ul > li
[09:11:21] <AdamPDotty> in jQuery that is nav.children('ul').children('li').children('ul').children('li'). Whatever you prefer.
[09:13:02] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/
[09:13:39] <Cork> uh, why nbot just nav.find('ul > li > ul > li') ?
[09:13:50] <Cork> *not*
[09:14:28] <AdamPDotty> and that .find() on line 8 has to start deeper
[09:15:18] <AdamPDotty> so it should be effective to just save away the li levels
[09:16:11] <AdamPDotty> level1 = nav.children('ul').children('li'); level2 = level1.children('ul').children('li');
[09:19:15] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/2tzpr84v/
[09:19:21] <AdamPDotty> and one other thing: instead of all those &mdash; try: a:after {content: '—';}
[09:21:37] <AdamPDotty> level1.filter('.active').removeClass('active');
[09:23:05] <lissitzki> you mean like this?
[09:23:16] <lissitzki> ah no wiat
[09:27:31] <lissitzki> well, why also the submenu is becoming active?
[09:30:59] <AdamPDotty> seems to work
[09:32:27] <lissitzki> not for me :(
[09:32:48] <lissitzki> submenu click is not showing anything
[09:35:16] <undefined_bob> is that valid this the >ul?    $(".nav_css>ul").css
[09:35:50] <AdamPDotty> yep
[09:36:39] <undefined_bob> thanks :)
[09:40:40] <lissitzki> yup is working thanks AdamPDotty
[10:05:09] <undefined_bob> is it possible to target a css class inside an @media?
[10:05:29] <undefined_bob> I tried with $(".my-class").css('display', ''); but I have .my-class outside of the @media too
[10:06:25] <Cork> undefined_bob: $() doesn't target a class
[10:06:39] <Cork> it targets the inline style of the element matching that selector
[10:07:02] <Cork> so if it is currently matched from inside or outside the @media doesn't matter
[10:07:56] <Cork> undefined_bob: if you want @media to keep working you should toggle with a class, not .css()
[10:09:06] <undefined_bob> oh
[10:09:28] <undefined_bob> I dont even have inline style
[10:10:33] <undefined_bob> or did you mean it creates new inline style which then overwrite the style sheet?
[10:12:46] <undefined_bob> maybe my approach was totally wrong
[10:13:22] <Cork> yes
[10:13:31] <Cork> i mean it creates a new one
[10:13:45] <Cork> or more specifically it sets the value on the elements .style
[10:14:01] <Cork> and it is the same that <elm style=""> sets
[10:15:12] <undefined_bob> I have an element with class="my-class hide" and my-class has display:flex and hide has display:none !important; but my-class has an @media with display-flex !important; too and that overwrite my hide class
[10:15:51] <Cork> undefined_bob: you should not use !important in stylesheets unless you _don't want it to be able to change_
[10:15:53] <undefined_bob> ah that explain the css errors I got in the console which I couldnt explain
[10:16:13] <undefined_bob> ya I know but if I remove the !important it doesnt work anymore
[10:16:28] <Cork> you need to follow the specificy rules in css
[10:16:48] <undefined_bob> I have to google what that means
[10:17:20] <Cork> for example #id is more specific then anything so if you want to override it with a class you need to have the id in the class selector
[10:17:27] <Cork> so #id {} #id.hide {}
[10:17:32] <Cork> for example
[10:17:47] <Cork> otherwise it is length of selector (basically)
[10:18:05] <Cork> undefined_bob: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity
[10:18:11] <grapheti> https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/specificity-calculationbase.png
[10:18:28] <undefined_bob> thanks
[10:18:40] <grapheti> https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/cssspecificity-calc-1.png
[10:19:01] <grapheti> The higher the number, the higher the specificity.
[10:19:58] <undefined_bob> I tried to build a css only menu for users with no javascript. so hide the js menu and show the css only per default. and hide the css only and show the JS one with JS
[10:20:27] <undefined_bob> but its confusing right now because of all those !important
[10:20:31] <undefined_bob> https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/WMjWba
[10:20:35] <AdamPDotty> arrgh
[10:20:41] <AdamPDotty> important is evil
[10:25:52] <grapheti> undefined_bob, I think this is more a #css question
[10:26:35] <AdamPDotty> basically you want nav class="css" and nav class="js", then .js display:none; #js .js display:block; #js .css display:none; $('html').prop('id', 'js')
[10:26:54] <AdamPDotty> should be enough for the basic part
[10:37:01] <undefined_bob> yes, something like that, AdamPDotty
[10:37:42] <undefined_bob> thanks for the suggestions
[11:01:01] <Z3R0> Anyone here used xeditable? having a weird css issue and I don’t know why in regards to Bootstrap Columns and using xeditable … for some reason I get a small unaligned text box… by like 2-3px, but everythign is the exact same sizes… it looks like a top padding/margin is somewhere, but I don’t see ANYTHING in inspector
[11:01:07] <Z3R0> oh wait… I think I know :D

[14:32:51] <alexises> Hello, I would like to do a "fake form" that just call an event on submit and allow me to pass data to a REST API
[15:02:29] <taplar> alexises: so what's your question?
[15:05:36] <alexises> hum, I just can'f get to get the form submission and avoid submission on the end of event
[15:06:51] <taplar> you can do preventDefault() on the submit event to cancel it before you proceed with your ajax logic
[15:07:28] <taplar> though, how do you envision users "submitting" this form?
[15:09:11] <RonaldsMazitis> can anybody help me make this ? http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1535/
[15:09:35] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis make *what*?
[15:09:47] <RonaldsMazitis> I want ajax to submit my file
[15:09:58] <alexises> taplar: hum, with a dumb submit button, I think I'm a little bit dumb ^^
[15:10:00] <taplar> first off, look at your console
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis so where are you getting stuck?
[15:10:36] <taplar> alexises: then if you want to force them to click the button to submit, then you really don't need a form.  you can just put your stuff in a div or whatever and then bind the handler to the button click
[15:10:47] <RonaldsMazitis> it is not uploading file after I choose it
[15:11:41] <robertmaxrees> message: message, RonaldsMazitis?
[15:11:55] <RonaldsMazitis>  data: message,
[15:11:56] <RonaldsMazitis> ?
[15:12:07] <robertmaxrees> should be data: yeah
[15:14:25] <RonaldsMazitis> is is not doing submitting
[15:14:34] <RonaldsMazitis> ajax does not happen
[15:14:47] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis are you looking at your network tab?
[15:15:07] <RonaldsMazitis> I'm just looking at what happens
[15:15:12] <RonaldsMazitis> document.getElementById("message").onchange = function() {
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> also: you want to pass the form itself, not an inpuit.
[15:15:30] <robertmaxrees> even your code says var message = new FormData(this); // <-- 'this' is your form element
[15:15:41] <robertmaxrees> but document.getElementById("message") is getting a specific input
[15:16:57] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1536/
[15:17:02] <taplar> i'd probably swap to a $() lookup also
[15:17:07] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:17:28] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis that should be working.
[15:17:33] <robertmaxrees> you sure that url is right"?
[15:18:14] <RonaldsMazitis> yes
[15:18:23] <taplar> that one is also binding on submit, rather than change
[15:18:24] <RonaldsMazitis> I just think that it does not submits
[15:18:38] <robertmaxrees> you can confirm by looking at your network tab.
[15:18:44] <robertmaxrees> that way you don't think, you know :)
[15:19:12] <RonaldsMazitis> alert('11');
[15:19:17] <RonaldsMazitis> nothing alerts so
[15:19:20] <RonaldsMazitis> no submit
[15:19:27] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating the form?
[15:19:32] <RonaldsMazitis> yes
[15:19:39] <robertmaxrees> that might be why.
[15:19:47] <robertmaxrees> uise a delegated binding instead.
[15:19:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[15:20:03] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[15:22:11] <RonaldsMazitis> I changed form to static still no response
[15:22:22] <robertmaxrees> and your js is after the form?
[15:23:19] <RonaldsMazitis> yes
[15:23:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4cwpLvae/1537/
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> 'cause this is logging just fine.
[15:24:46] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[15:24:58] <RonaldsMazitis> I have no button
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> how are you submitting the form?
[15:25:40] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1536/
[15:25:50] <taplar> iirc, forms with more than one input field will not submit on enter, if there is not a submit button.
[15:26:07] <robertmaxrees> fina right, so how are you submitting the form?
[15:26:12] <robertmaxrees> oops.
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis ^^
[15:26:32] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1535/
[15:26:36] <RonaldsMazitis> in this I tried to
[15:26:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:26:47] <RonaldsMazitis> document.getElementById("message").onchange = function() {
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:05] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[15:27:27] <taplar> RonaldsMazitis: that is fine, but back to roberts point, you have to give FormData the form
[15:27:37] <taplar> so if you want to keep it in that flavor, you have to get the this's parent form
[15:28:14] <taplar> and there is still a console error with that fiddle
[15:28:56] <RonaldsMazitis> that onchange does not alerts
[15:29:14] <taplar> there is an parse error in the console
[15:29:21] <taplar> it will keep any script from running
[15:29:49] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1538/
[15:30:12] <taplar> hold on
[15:30:23] <taplar> you're jumping back and forth between versions
[15:30:25] <taplar> pick which one you want to make work
[15:30:41] <RonaldsMazitis> this one looks ok
[15:30:57] <taplar> so you need to give it a way to submit
[15:31:19] <RonaldsMazitis>   $('#target').submit();
[15:31:39] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1539/
[15:31:42] <RonaldsMazitis> error
[15:32:10] <taplar> sure, you didn't close your method
[15:32:31] <taplar> also it's slightly bad practice to do that
[15:33:02] <taplar> rather than catching an event, generating another event, and performing logic.  just perform your logic in the first event
[15:33:34] <RonaldsMazitis> how
[15:34:06] <taplar> inside the change event, you have the 'this' that is the input.  you can get the parent form from that with jquery
[15:34:10] <taplar> are you familiar with how?
[15:34:40] <RonaldsMazitis> no
[15:34:52] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[15:36:41] <RonaldsMazitis> can You spare a line of code how would You do this, I'm lost
[15:36:54] <taplar> look down at some of the examples in that page
[15:37:31] <taplar> you give it a selector identifying which parent of the element it should return
[15:38:12] <RonaldsMazitis> document.getElementById("message").onchange = function(event) {
[15:38:12] <RonaldsMazitis>   $( event.target ).closest(  $('#fileUploadForm').submit() );
[15:38:28] <taplar> that's not a selector
[15:38:45] <taplar> also you don't need to call submit if you are doing the logic in on change
[15:46:18] <RonaldsMazitis> it just reloads page
[15:46:28] <RonaldsMazitis> instead of alerting me that submit happened
[15:47:33] <taplar> that shouldn't happen if you are not submitting
[15:47:39] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1540/
[15:49:10] <taplar> k, if you are just going to ignore what i'm suggesting, then i'm going to stop trying
[15:49:55] <RonaldsMazitis> I'm really bad at doing that kind of reading
[15:50:17] <taplar> you literally just have to use closest in your on change to get the form and then give it to your FormData
[15:50:19] <grapheti> Then put it in js fiddle and figure it out
[15:53:27] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1543/
[15:54:06] <RonaldsMazitis> message change
[15:54:26] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1544/

[16:00:45] <grapheti> undefined means that's not the right one
[16:00:58] <RonaldsMazitis> console.log($(this).closest('#fileUploadForm').trigger('submit'));

[16:14:42] <taplar> sounds like the delegate issue
[16:14:48] <taplar> if the element doesn't exist yet
[16:15:28] <robertmaxrees> if you're dynamically creating the form, you should use delegation.
[16:16:20] <RonaldsMazitis> same error if form is static
[16:16:50] <devi8> RonaldsMazitis,is it possible that you are getting the error because you are using $('message') instead of $("#message") ?
[16:16:59] <RonaldsMazitis> tried
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> RonaldsMazitis right, but is your code before or after the form on the page?
[16:18:08] <RonaldsMazitis> after the form
[16:19:08] <robertmaxrees> then something isn't adding up.
[16:20:18] <RonaldsMazitis> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1550/
[16:20:50] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/4cwpLvae/1551/
[16:21:39] <RonaldsMazitis> 0
[16:21:49] <robertmaxrees> then the element doesn't yet exist.
[16:22:17] <devi8> I got 1...
[16:22:30] <devi8> but I added on dom ready
[16:22:31] <robertmaxrees> devi8 it's been fine in the fiddle, but not on his actual site.
[16:22:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:22:35] <RonaldsMazitis> 			$('#outputximage').load('xchatimage')
[16:22:47] <RonaldsMazitis> this is not static?
[16:22:50] <taplar> no
[16:22:50] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:22:56] <robertmaxrees> that's using ajax under the hood.
[16:22:56] <taplar> that's an asynchronous load
[16:23:11] <robertmaxrees> if you use event delegation, though, it won't matter.
[16:23:21] <taplar> or put this binding in the callback to that load method
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> ^ though be careful if you load that form multiple times./
[16:24:09] <taplar> heh, if he's doing that he has bigger issues, due to the id
[16:24:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[16:24:25] <RonaldsMazitis> I need username of the user
[16:24:33] <RonaldsMazitis> who I am sending image file to
[16:24:41] <RonaldsMazitis> I can't just make it static
[16:24:49] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> just delegate the handler and you'll be g2g
[16:29:02] <RonaldsMazitis> ok but form does not do anything
[16:29:07] <RonaldsMazitis> on static
[16:29:29] <robertmaxrees> dudebro.
[16:29:36] <robertmaxrees> when you say "static", what are you referring to?
[16:31:00] <RonaldsMazitis> 500 (Internal Server Error)
[16:31:06] <RonaldsMazitis> for my php file
[16:31:15] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:31:39] <RonaldsMazitis> form
[16:31:54] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question...
[16:42:43] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:46:45] <GeekMonkey_> I am using magnific popup and want iframes to load faster
[16:46:48] <GeekMonkey_> any thoughts
[16:47:25] <z1haze> i cant figure out why this yaml parser is telling me my yaml is invalid when i took the sample code right off the offical site
[16:47:28] <z1haze> any of you guys use YAML?
[16:48:07] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/2E49H8B errors when i run it through http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
[16:53:25] <shoky_> z1haze: it only errors with json output
[16:53:47] <shoky_> try to read the errors ;)
[16:54:21] <z1haze> Im reading it, but why it is erroring if its supposedly valid
[16:54:33] <Woet> shoky_: reading is not z1haze's strong suit
[16:54:48] <shoky_> z1haze: again, it's only erroring when converting to json
[16:55:00] <Woet> shoky_: case in point
[16:55:01] <shoky_> nothing to do with invalid yaml
[16:55:23] <z1haze> thats my point.
[16:55:43] <z1haze> one would assume that if it doesnt render to json properly, its probably invalid - how else do I check if its correct
[16:55:52] <shoky_> why would one assume that?
[16:55:55] <shoky_> json has no sets.
[16:56:23] <shoky_> don't convert to json if you want to check for valid yaml :)
[16:56:25] <z1haze> https://nodeca.github.io/js-yaml/
[16:56:48] <z1haze> line 40 is a set
[16:57:09] <shoky_> so?
[16:57:28] <z1haze> it renders out just fine
[16:57:35] <shoky_> so?
[16:57:41] <z1haze> so it is fucking serializable
[16:58:10] <z1haze> any valid javascript object should serialize
[16:58:25] <shoky_> 1) it's not json output, it's JS.  2) it's not a set in the output, it's just a JS object.  3) it's a totally different converter, who cares, you want to validate yaml
[16:58:43] <z1haze> the link i showed you isnt outputting JSONM
[16:58:53] <shoky_> what do you want to do..
[16:58:58] <Woet> z1haze: can we just get back to an actual question
[16:59:06] <Woet> instead of arguing some random online YAML parser
[16:59:10] <Woet> not seeing any jQuery relevance
[16:59:18] <z1haze> im just lookin for a reliable way to know its correct
[16:59:28] <shoky_> one JSON converter not being able to convert to JSON says nothing about anything
[16:59:41] <shoky_> z1haze then don't convert yaml
[16:59:43] <shoky_> just validate
[16:59:43] <z1haze> yeah, I mean i just take it as it works, ive been using this one for years
[17:00:02] <shoky_> e.g. http://www.yamllint.com/
[17:00:15] <shoky_> you were not using a yaml validator
[17:00:17] <z1haze> https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator - same code says its invlaid
[17:00:35] <z1haze> invalid - taking it straight frm the doc page
[17:00:55] <shoky_> right, not a good validator it seems
[17:01:22] <shoky_> works fine in the one i linked
[17:01:26] <z1haze> i see
[17:01:30] <z1haze> hard to know which is correct
[17:02:10] <mrush> is there a jquery / js equivalent of ruby's .class ? how should i test whether an array contains another arry
[17:02:18] <shoky_> if it's not validating something from the official spec, then it's not correct ;)
[17:02:41] <z1haze> haha, of course. lot of work to make sure it is though
[17:02:49] <taplar> mrush: take a look at lodash
[17:03:12] <mrush> yay fp
[17:03:18] <mrush> thanks taplar
[17:04:03] <mrush> is there no js .class though
[17:04:32] <taplar> i'm not entirely sure what you are talking about.  i was addressing the "find array in another array" part
[17:04:38] <mrush> i think im trying to recurse
[17:04:52] <mrush> okay np, thank you taplar
[17:11:28] <z1haze> shoky_, Im trying to create essentially in yaml, an array of objects that contain arrays
[17:12:05] <Gh0st_Preacher> fun fact: JSON is valid YAML.
[17:14:44] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/10A7YZM this is pretty one one object, i want to have multiple tiles
[17:15:49] <z1haze> thats what brought here here.. assuming that if its valid yaml, it should be just fine through this that parser to tell me its good
[17:16:03] <z1haze> but i was made fun of for it :)
[17:16:07] <robertmaxrees> how does this tie into jquery?
[17:16:24] <z1haze> was messing this doing a jquery yml parser
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:16:44] <z1haze> from yaml to json
[17:17:00] <robertmaxrees> why would you use jquery to do tha?
[17:17:15] <z1haze> something a less technical person can enter a config for a template, etc. and then we could store the config in json
[17:17:52] <robertmaxrees> and why not just use a preexisting lib?
[17:17:56] <z1haze> why does that seem odd
[17:18:13] <z1haze> but anyway, my paste here: http://dpaste.com/10A7YZM how would i have multiple tiles in here?
[17:18:23] <robertmaxrees> because jquery is a dom manipulation lib.
[17:19:37] <z1haze> right, so the user enters a yaml configuration in a box, then they see the dom updated
[17:20:12] <z1haze> this avoids having to have a bunch of different admin pages with different fields enabled, disabled
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> sure, to write that stuff out.  i'd get a yaml -> json converter and then go from there.
[17:23:35] <devi8> I am having the worst time getting sticky headers to work. Any help? Here is a link with diagrams, explanations, and a limited use case to practice: https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/NyjQNO?editors=1000
[17:24:04] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, im just trying to figure out the yaml stucture for what im trying to do. can you tell me how to make tiles an array of objects
[17:24:13] <z1haze> where title, quote type, images, are keys
[17:24:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze nope.  i don't use yaml heh
[17:24:27] <z1haze> oh ok
[17:24:36] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire #yaml though
[17:24:47] <robertmaxrees> devi8 why not use a plugin for this?
[17:25:05] <devi8> They all handle the event on the window and do one header
[17:25:08] <devi8> or stack headers
[17:25:17] <robertmaxrees> devi8 huh?
[17:25:32] <devi8> I have tried reading through several of them, but they don't apply.
[17:25:38] <robertmaxrees> why don't they?
[17:25:44] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/KQmLmg?editors=1000'
[17:26:10] <devi8> That is a messy one (of the literally 10 or 12 different approaches I have tried), but it gets the point across
[17:26:13] <robertmaxrees> so what is wrong with that, other than some minor jank?
[17:26:33] <devi8> who wants jank?
[17:26:34] <devi8> lol
[17:27:16] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[17:28:48] <devi8> the other thing this does is as the next section is visible, it updates the menus to show the current section and the current article.
[17:29:03] <devi8> which is easy..
[17:29:12] <devi8> but this header part is not for some reason
[17:29:15] <robertmaxrees> so you want both sticky headers and section highlighting?
[17:29:25] <robertmaxrees> so what does that codepen NOT give you?
[17:30:02] <devi8> it's jittery.
[17:30:02] <devi8> I just need help getting rid of the jitter.
[17:30:13] <robertmaxrees> so then fix that problem heh
[17:30:27] <robertmaxrees> instead of throwing the whole solution out heh
[17:31:09] <devi8> I am not exaggerating when I say that I have literally spent at least 14 hours a day for the last three days trying to get this to work.  I have started over at least 8 times...probably more.
[17:31:55] <devi8> I wanted to get as far as I could before asking for help and I have come REALLY close a couple of times.
[17:32:22] <taplar> reduce the amount of lookups you perform in the scroll event handlers
[17:32:26] <taplar> also throttle them
[17:33:34] <devi8> I do that. I listen for the scrolling to start and only trigger the update every 200 ms. rather than every scroll event
[17:33:54] <devi8> I even tried to use request animation frame...
[17:33:58] <devi8> didn't help
[17:34:24] <taplar> i don't see any throttling in the scroll binding
[17:34:48] <devi8> lemme see if this is the version that i tried throttlling..b
[17:36:05] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/JpNbXZ?editors=0110  ignore the colors and layout. I was trying to track what was happening where
[17:37:14] <devi8> I capture the first scroll event and discard the others. Then every 200 ms I check to see if the scroll distance is close to 0 if so, I stop the timeout loop
[17:43:32] <taplar> kinda like this?  https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GQEMWe?editors=0010
[17:45:09] <devi8> THe problem with throttling like that is that if you scorll fast, it messes up because the content has scrolled faster than you can update
[17:45:20] <devi8> You end up with overlapping fixed headers
[17:45:32] <taplar> yeah, saw that with using page down and page up
[17:45:36] <taplar> :s
[17:45:52] <devi8> but it's close...
[17:47:20] <taplar> which if is the part that unsticks it?
[17:47:21] <devi8> My latest stab at it has been to use flexbox to align to bottom when scrolling up...that came out much smoother since I dind't have to calculate the new position of the top section header
[17:48:55] <devi8> line 123 and line 109 maybe.   I can't see the line numbers very well.
[17:49:26] <taplar> so the align top and align bottom classes?
[17:49:50] <devi8> align bottom is when the content is being scrolled up..the top section aligns the header with the bottom
[17:50:12] <devi8> align top is when scrolling down and the section top is in the window...align the header to the top
[17:50:19] <devi8> otherwise it stays fixed
[17:51:30] <devi8> I tried adding and removing classes...didn't work .So I tried attr("class") and .prop("class") and just .css()
[17:52:07] <devi8> I use filter to get the "current" section so that I can then update the section menu based on the scroll position
[17:52:48] <taplar> i wonder, have you tried implementing this with scrollspy?  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/scrollspy/
[17:53:04] <devi8> no i have not. I'll look into it
[17:53:05] <taplar> the list group version is slightly similar
[17:53:28] <taplar> it doesn't sticky them, but you can probably modify that
[17:55:47] <devi8> I have the update menu function pretty well rounded out. I create a $.fn.linked()  method to grab all the links associated with an article header to build my menus. So I can just use $("a").linked().addClass('current'); and it automatically updates the section and site menus and any content-links to those articles
[17:56:21] <devi8> and then on scroll it filters the highest article whose bottom>0 and top<0 ...that's the current article.
[17:57:59] <devi8> I guess I am having problems swtiching from fixed to absolute without things getting jumpy..somehow I need to copy all of the properties of the header, convert them to offset coordinates and then apply them when switching
[17:59:04] <devi8> the requestAnimationFrame method was pretty smooth, but I am not sure I was doing it right...
[17:59:13] <lissitzki> hi people
[17:59:26] <lissitzki> new little problem here
[17:59:28] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/
[17:59:50] <lissitzki> two buttons to change class in the divs below
[18:00:07] <taplar> "column" isn't a valid tag name
[18:00:51] <lissitzki> no?
[18:01:10] <taplar> <column> afaik isn't a thing
[18:02:04] <lissitzki> it is used in spectre framework
[18:02:17] <lissitzki> as clas
[18:02:21] <lissitzki> s
[18:02:26] <taplar> i think you're missing my point
[18:02:56] <taplar> think about what i just said, and then think about your intended logic
[18:03:22] <lissitzki> ok
[18:04:01] <shoky_> where does he use 'column' as tag name?
[18:04:12] <lissitzki> columns
[18:04:12] <taplar> find("column")
[18:04:20] <shoky_> that's not what i'm seeing
[18:04:28] <lissitzki> ops
[18:04:31] <taplar> $('#body').find("column").attr("class", "col-3");
[18:04:42] <lissitzki> try now
[18:04:54] <shoky_> huh i don't see that
[18:04:59] <lissitzki> refresh shoky_
[18:05:05] <lissitzki> 'll see it
[18:05:09] <taplar> i'm just trying to get him to see it's an incorrect selector
[18:05:42] <lissitzki> column is a div inside another section from my click
[18:05:48] <lissitzki> handler
[18:05:53] <shoky_> yeah i get that, i'm just not seeing the same code you are, i see $('.columns').find(".column")
[18:06:12] <taplar> you got a /# in your fiddle?  mine doesn't have it
[18:06:21] <shoky_> nope
[18:06:34] <taplar> ok, i refreshed and it changed
[18:06:36] <taplar> :s
[18:06:52] <lissitzki> my fault
[18:07:02] <shoky_> i thought jsfiddle doesn't do that type of nonsense :\
[18:07:06] <taplar> same
[18:07:13] <taplar> maybe since he's signed in?
[18:07:30] <shoky_> shrugs
[18:07:36] <lissitzki> well i updated it and set as base
[18:08:11] <shoky_> ah
[18:08:12] <taplar> so did that fix your issue?
[18:08:16] <lissitzki> anyway, if you guys refresh now we are sure we have the same thing
[18:09:23] <lissitzki> no, my question is, does my selector need to go all the way from my handelr to the targe?t
[18:09:38] <taplar> elaborate?
[18:10:21] <grapheti> and listen
[18:10:43] <lissitzki> I'm not sure how the selector works
[18:10:48] <taplar> which one?
[18:11:00] <lissitzki> $('columns')
[18:11:12] <grapheti> wait, that's collaborate - I failed :/
[18:11:15] <taplar> ^ find all elements with a tagName of "columns"
[18:11:49] <taplar> $('.columns') would be find all elements with a class of 'columns'
[18:12:07] <taplar> the period is important
[18:12:53] <lissitzki> ok and find(".col8") all the div children of columns that have this class
[18:13:17] <taplar> not necessarily divs
[18:13:29] <taplar> your selector doesn't explicitly say that
[18:13:30] <lissitzki> ok, just in this case
[18:13:39] <lissitzki> ah i need to tell this
[18:13:52] <taplar> you don't have to specify that if you know they are all divs
[18:13:57] <taplar> i'm just pointing it out
[18:14:39] <lissitzki> ok
[18:14:57] <taplar> $(parentSelector).find(childSelector) will find all elements that match the parent selector, and then for each of those, find all the children that match the child selector.
[18:15:04] <lissitzki> so till now my selector seems ok to me
[18:15:10] <taplar> and by 'children' i mean at any level
[18:15:24] <taplar> directly nested or deeper
[18:15:57] <robertmaxrees> descendents
[18:18:31] <lissitzki> my selector seems fine then, descendants of .columns with .col-8 class is what i'm looking for
[18:19:43] <taplar> i want to point out something though
[18:19:45] <taplar> $('.columns').find(".column").attr("class", "col-3");
[18:20:05] <taplar> ^ that attr() call, is replacing the entire class attribute.  'column' will no longer exist in it
[18:20:46] <lissitzki> yes i know, was trying to make things simpler for now
[18:21:05] <robertmaxrees> how is that simpler?
[18:21:43] <lissitzki> because i don't know if attr can add two classes
[18:22:12] <lissitzki> just trying to understand why selector is not working for now
[18:22:43] <taplar> I would suggest not using attr() and using addClass() and removeClass() instead
[18:22:52] <lissitzki> ok
[18:23:05] <taplar> because otherwise your toggle between the two is going to break with what you have
[18:24:06] <lissitzki> later on i'll not know if i need to remove col-3 or col-2 or col-8
[18:24:25] <taplar> remove all of them.  add the one that should be there
[18:24:32] <lissitzki> cool
[18:24:46] <taplar> trying to remove a class that is not there will not break anything
[18:27:10] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/8/
[18:28:22] <lissitzki> i saw adding preventDefault to click event, but not sure if i should
[18:29:14] <taplar> are your buttons inside a form?
[18:30:07] <lissitzki> no
[18:30:26] <taplar> then it's not really necessary
[18:30:39] <lissitzki> yup
[18:31:55] <lissitzki> wait, my selector should be fine but still not working, is my variable bugged?
[18:32:37] <lissitzki> there was a mistake, but still not working
[18:32:42] <lissitzki> a-
[18:35:58] <taplar> looks like the click event is not happening for the icon in the button
[18:36:05] <taplar> you probably will have to bind to the button
[18:38:46] <lissitzki> i delete the button and is happening
[18:48:06] <taplar> been a good day
[18:48:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm envious
[18:48:23] <taplar> bad day?
[18:48:52] <robertmaxrees> got a nice letter from out corporate tax department looking for details on work I did from 7/31/2016 to 7/31/2017.
[18:49:07] <robertmaxrees> looking for credits based on R&D
[18:49:12] <taplar> aaaah
[18:49:26] <taplar> i hate that crap
[18:50:07] <taplar> we have to keep track of our hours in a general sense for that stuff
[18:50:35] <taplar> some groups though are like by the half hour keeping track of what they do.  different managers and all
[18:51:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, we don't do very much of that generally.
[18:52:18] <robertmaxrees> my manager went through this a few years ago so he's had some good advice on what they're looking for.
[18:57:35] <taplar> hasta luego
[19:16:14] <lissitzki> last question if you still around, the code before https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/
[19:16:33] <lissitzki> i'm using on the site, and strange thing is that is not always working
[19:16:56] <lissitzki> sometimes i have to refresh the page several times to make it work..
[19:18:20] <robertmaxrees> is the event handler binding at all?
[19:18:51] <lissitzki> i updated with the actual code i'm using it
[19:19:00] <lissitzki> yes it was working
[19:19:17] <lissitzki> then i didn't change it, just refresh the page and not
[19:19:19] <robertmaxrees> you sure that's the actual code?
[19:19:30] <lissitzki> copy paste
[19:19:35] <lissitzki> for the jquery
[19:19:35] <robertmaxrees> that's invalid JS.
[19:19:40] <robertmaxrees> mixxing a ).
[19:19:42] <robertmaxrees> *missing
[19:20:00] <robertmaxrees> also: var $square1 = $(' .fa-square-full');
[19:20:05] <robertmaxrees> why the extra space at the beginning?
[19:20:22] <lissitzki> the ) is in the original
[19:20:27] <robertmaxrees> ;p;
[19:20:30] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[19:20:31] <lissitzki> probably the white space
[19:20:40] <robertmaxrees> no way for me to know.  mind updating with your code?
[19:21:22] <robertmaxrees> also: don't be afraid to console.log to see if, say, those elements exists at the time of binding.
[19:21:36] <robertmaxrees> if they do, stick console.logs in the handlers and see if they fire.
[19:22:19] <lissitzki> i delete the white space still haveing issues
[19:22:27] <lissitzki> working some times
[19:22:31] <lissitzki> let me see with console
[19:23:11] <lissitzki> you mean console after the event on handler?
[19:23:45] <robertmaxrees> inside the handler.
[19:24:32] <lissitzki> https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/
[19:24:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:24:53] <robertmaxrees> does that log anything out?
[19:24:59] <lissitzki> no
[19:25:16] <robertmaxrees> so try logging beforehand to see if the elements are even there.
[19:25:46] <lissitzki> then i refresh and it wasa working again
[19:25:50] <lissitzki> console log = 1
[19:25:57] <robertmaxrees> try a hard refresh.
[19:26:01] <robertmaxrees> clear cache and reload.
[19:26:18] <lissitzki> nope
[19:26:37] <robertmaxrees> "nope" as in...?
[19:27:59] <lissitzki> not working
[19:28:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're not getting the console log at all?>
[19:28:50] <robertmaxrees> just to be clear, you're doing https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uyqb1vwx/15/, right?
[19:30:30] <lissitzki> yes
[19:30:48] <lissitzki> but n console log at all
[19:30:59] <robertmaxrees> that means the code never even loads.
[19:31:04] <robertmaxrees> which can be caused by a few different things.
[19:35:41] <lissitzki> sosmetimes it loads sometimes not
[19:46:53] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab.
[19:46:54] <robertmaxrees> what does it say
[19:46:55] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:47:35] <lissitzki> the js part is uppose
[19:47:50] <robertmaxrees> "uppose"?
[19:47:55] <lissitzki> i suppose
[19:48:00] <lissitzki> lol
[19:48:03] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:48:33] <robertmaxrees> you're being kind of vague heh.
[19:48:36] <robertmaxrees> is the file loading or what?>
[19:48:58] <lissitzki> yes is there
[19:49:08] <grapheti> Are there any errors?
[19:49:10] <grapheti> 404?
[19:49:22] <lissitzki> 304
[19:49:29] <lissitzki> not modified
[19:49:40] <lissitzki> all js have this
[19:50:44] <grapheti> Ah, all I know is if you put that in a calculator and turn it upside down, it spells, "hoe."
[19:51:14] <lissitzki> true
[19:51:17] <grapheti> (just joined, have no context)
[19:51:48] <Guest6450> wtf am i seeing
[19:51:56] <grapheti> LOL
[19:52:14] <grapheti> You like it you mystery man.
[19:52:58] <lissitzki> well it's https://jsfiddle.net/el_lissitzki/uyqb1vwx/ not working propeerly on my site,
[19:53:20] <lissitzki> sometimes is working just fine sometimes after reloading page not working at alll
[19:53:36] <Guest6450> thats horible delete it now
[19:53:49] <Guest6450> before other ppl see it
[19:54:49] <lissitzki> talking about?
[19:55:36] <grapheti> delete Line.withHoeInIt
[19:58:38] <robertmaxrees> lissitzki are you dynamically creating those elements or something?
[19:58:42] <robertmaxrees> is your html valid?
[19:58:49] <lissitzki> yes
[19:58:57] <robertmaxrees> yes to the dynamic creation?
[19:58:59] <lissitzki> they are dynamically created
[19:59:07] <robertmaxrees> like, using JS, right?
[19:59:09] <lissitzki> and it is valid
[19:59:14] <robertmaxrees> because that could cause problems.
[19:59:30] <lissitzki> i see
[19:59:32] <grapheti> If it works in jsfiddle, but not on your site. It's usually from conflicting scripts or elements that don't exist and scripts are referencing
[19:59:36] <grapheti> Could be a lot of things tho
[20:00:02] <robertmaxrees> you can use a delegated handler to solve that though.

[20:00:19] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[20:00:53] <lissitzki> ok thanks robertmaxrees
[20:00:59] <lissitzki> i'll check it tomorrow
[22:16:38] <Rockwood> konrados, works awesome
[22:16:49] <konrados> cool :)
[22:17:08] <Rockwood> just exception should be there
[22:41:43] <devi8> How are you supposed to troubleshoot your script when you get an error message  like" cannot read property replace of undefined" in jquery...which I know is a bug in my script--just how do you find it?
[22:42:04] <Woet> should tell you the file and the line
[22:42:08] <Woet> even clickable in some browsers
[22:42:43] <devi8> I'm using chrome and all the links are to jquery min
[22:42:55] <devi8> normally, there's a pen.js link that takes me right to it
[22:43:02] <Woet> there should be a tracepath
[22:44:25] <devi8> Yeah. I expand the tracepath and they are all either anonymous functions or jquery functions..should I just go through each anonymous to find my error?
[22:47:30] <devi8> wait...you can't get the current css of an element by $("el").css()
[22:49:50] <devi8> That is wild. Why not just return the complete computed style?   Woet, thanks for the help
[23:02:12] <Rockwood> hi newbie666
