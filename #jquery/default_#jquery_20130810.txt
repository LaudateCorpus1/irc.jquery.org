[00:16:57] <fooman2011> Hello. I'm new in the web programming. I would like to pass an argument between the main window and a window created using window.open. I'm using Chrome and I have tried to use window.opener without any succes. I tried to use window.openDialog too but it seems to not exist...Any idea ?
[00:34:33] <doug65536> fooman2011: let me see...
[00:36:42] <guspollos> is ther a way to specify a parent class that's a certain class?
[00:36:54] <guspollos> aka, the first ancestor class with the class "hello"
[00:37:20] <doug65536> search up the DOM for something with class hello?
[00:37:40] <doug65536> .closest('.className')
[00:39:05] <guspollos> doug65536, does .closet() search up the ancestor only?
[00:39:10] <guspollos> would i look for the cloest children?
[00:39:26] <doug65536> no it goes the other way, through parents
[00:42:02] <doug65536> it walks "up" the dom tree, visiting the parent each time, until an element matches the selector. if nothing in the chain of parents match, returns empty set
[00:42:18] <doug65536> returns 0 or 1 objects
[00:42:40] <doug65536> guspollos: ^
[00:42:56] <guspollos> ahh I see
[00:42:56] <guspollos> thanks
[00:43:11] <doug65536> np
[00:43:28] <guspollos> when I remove an element, and the elements after it are moving up, is there a way to set the animation speed?
[00:44:31] <doug65536> guspollos: do slideUp on it, then in the completion handler, remove it
[00:44:40] <doug65536> should work
[00:45:02] <guspollos> ther'es no natural css approach?
[00:45:17] <doug65536> guspollos: for an object being removed? doubt it
[00:45:31] <doug65536> what type of element?
[00:45:40] <guspollos> div
[00:45:41] <doug65536> I'll see if I can implement in a fiddle
[00:45:47] <guspollos> well this is what I mean
[00:45:53] <guspollos> I've bunch of DIV's stacked on one another
[00:46:02] <guspollos> I've a JS to remove one by one when you click a button
[00:46:11] <guspollos> whenever you remove a div, the ones after it autoamtically move up right?
[00:46:16] <guspollos> I want to animate that "moving up"
[00:48:22] <doug65536> guspollos:
[00:48:25] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SGXYh/
[00:53:24] <guspollos> doug65536, thanks, though it didn't solve the problem
[00:53:32] <guspollos> the element being removed is sliding
[00:53:37] <guspollos> but the other ones arent
[00:53:52] <guspollos> hold on, lemme JS fiddle my script
[00:54:21] <doug65536> guspollos: ah then the parent of the div must be maintaining the height?
[00:54:30] <doug65536> guspollos: I'll wait for the script :)
[00:55:35] <guspollos> http://jsfiddle.net/uad2Q/
[00:55:44] <guspollos> dogarrhea, click remove and you'll see it
[00:55:52] <guspollos> doug65536, woops
[01:01:17] <guspollos> any idea doug65536 ?
[01:01:26] <doug65536> guspollos: I'm thinking :)
[01:01:31] <guspollos> okay xD
[01:04:10] <doug65536> guspollos: this works better but not quite http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uad2Q/2/
[01:04:32] <guspollos> lol
[01:04:34] <guspollos> it's weird
[01:04:39] <guspollos> why doesn't the border want to move??
[01:04:52] <doug65536> does it have position: relative?
[01:05:17] <doug65536> it does
[01:07:01] <guspollos> actually it does fade out fine: http://jsfiddle.net/uad2Q/3/
[01:07:12] <guspollos> but the thing is, the rest of the elements aren't being animated
[01:07:19] <doug65536> you read my mind
[01:07:27] <guspollos> the fading out is animated. but when the rest of the elements move up, there should be a way to animate
[01:11:26] <doug65536> guspollos: I set the panel height to 500px, no effect
[01:18:02] <doug65536> guspollos: this isn't even possible: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uad2Q/4/
[01:18:22] <doug65536> oops. my bad
[01:18:35] <guspollos> lolwhat
[01:18:48] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uad2Q/5/
[01:19:17] <doug65536> guspollos: something about the css is overriding the height change
[01:19:31] <guspollos> the height of what?
[01:19:34] <guspollos> of panels?
[01:19:39] <doug65536> .panel ya
[01:20:24] <doug65536> I think I found it
[01:20:53] <guspollos> I did set a min-height and max-height for panel
[01:20:58] <doug65536> crap, thought min-height was it
[01:21:32] <doug65536> but wait a minute...
[01:21:37] <doug65536> it is an inherited !important
[01:21:45] <doug65536> will setting it on the element do anything?
[01:23:24] <guspollos> no
[01:23:41] <guspollos> the !important on the max/min-height of .panel isn't all that important
[01:27:29] <doug65536> guspollos: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uad2Q/6/
[01:27:33] <doug65536> put a gun to its head
[01:28:05] <guspollos> OMG YESS
[01:28:06] <guspollos> xD
[01:28:10] <guspollos> hwo did you do it??
[01:28:40] <doug65536> blew away all the minheights in the whole subtree of the dom
[01:28:47] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/uad2Q/7/
[01:29:40] <doug65536> guspollos: ^
[01:30:23] <guspollos> Ahhh it was the min height
[01:32:03] <doug65536> if you want it a bit more elegant, consider adding a .nominheight { min-height: 0px !important } and addclass the whole subtree instead of attr style trick
[01:32:22] <doug65536> + ; after important
[01:34:00] <fooman2011> Do you know how to pass arguments between windows in javascript ?
[01:34:19] <doug65536> fooman2011: you are using window.open right?
[01:35:33] <fooman2011> I think
[01:35:41] <fooman2011> Let me check with a simple sample
[01:35:56] <doug65536> fooman2011: the subwindow can access its owner through window.opener
[01:36:33] <doug65536> fooman2011: the other possibility is storing the return value of window.open, then just creating properties on that object
[01:37:00] <doug65536> fooman2011: another possibility is adding a query string on the end of the url
[01:38:27] <doug65536> fooman2011: another possibility would be to use some technique above, then search the DOM and force a click on a hidden button to tell the subwindow that you have initialized the "arguments"
[01:40:46] <EvilNo0B> Hello, i need some help , for example i have tabs , now what i need to do is close active tab, (if somebody clicks on the tab link ( the link that opens this tab ) while this tab is opened already , close it instead of opening again same tab or doing nothing )
[01:42:01] <fooman2011> doug65536: I would like to pass javascript object so I think that query string is not a good choice right ?
[01:42:25] <doug65536> fooman2011: right
[01:42:40] <fooman2011> doug65536: problem is I don't have any variable shared between my 2 windows :(
[01:44:24] <fooman2011> Ok i have a simple sample of my problem I'm going to put it on a codewall
[01:46:38] <fooman2011> doug65536: The sample code is here: http://pastebin.com/NhRCht9A
[01:46:44] <fooman2011> doug65536: could you check it please ?
[01:47:18] <doug65536> yes
[01:48:00] <fooman2011> thank
[01:48:03] <fooman2011> s
[01:48:22] <EvilNo0B> how can i set some sort of check in here "if active tab is already active" than do $(activeTab).slideUp();
[01:48:35] <EvilNo0B> on click
[01:50:17] <doug65536> fooman2011:  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zk492/1/  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/y9By6/
[01:53:10] <fooman2011> doug65536: yeah ?
[01:53:30] <doug65536> I don't see any errors happening
[01:53:35] <doug65536> what's supposed to happen?
[01:53:45] <doug65536> I also don't see init firing
[01:55:25] <fooman2011> the console.log should display hello
[01:55:28] <fooman2011> and then
[01:55:42] <fooman2011> window.opener.myvalue = "something" (not undefined)
[01:55:44] <doug65536> problem is, I can't get the debugger displayed that fast
[01:56:07] <doug65536> wait, I'll add debugger statement
[01:58:01] <fooman2011> ok
[02:01:03] <guspollos> ok i got a new problem with scrollbar doug....
[02:01:51] <fooman2011> lol
[02:02:08] <guspollos> I customized my scrollbar: http://jsfiddle.net/uad2Q/8/
[02:02:21] <guspollos> but when you click continue, and try to remove an item, it moves....
[02:03:14] <doug65536> guspollos: perhaps because of style wipe. do any of the html tags have style= in there? my solution blows away style. could try appending to existing style
[02:03:37] <guspollos> no I don't do inline styling
[02:05:29] <guspollos> oh actually I set min-width now
[02:05:36] <guspollos> but hopefully doesn't cause any future prlblems like last time...
[02:08:25] <doug65536> fooman2011: wow, it's not working...
[02:10:22] <fooman2011> sure
[02:10:29] <fooman2011> this is my problem
[02:10:35] <doug65536> fooman2011: still trying
[02:10:40] <fooman2011> ?
[02:10:44] <doug65536> I'm closer
[02:29:59] <doug65536> fooman2011: ok!
[02:30:04] <doug65536> fooman2011: I made progress
[02:30:06] <doug65536> 1 sec
[02:41:53] <doug65536> fooman2011: nothing worked except document.write...
[02:42:17] <doug65536> fooman2011: so what I suggest is to serialize the object to json, escape it to html, and document.write it into the popup
[02:42:41] <doug65536> fooman2011: inside the popup you can deserialize it back, using jquery funcitions to encode and decode json
[02:43:04] <doug65536> fooman2011: that's the best I could come up with. I can't push values into the popup window and I can't pull values out of the parent window
[02:43:32] <doug65536> fooman2011: you can document.write it into a hidden element or a form with a hidden field
[02:48:23] <nick07> how can i add duration to this code? $(this).animate({ marginTop: "-7px" }, {queue: false});
[02:52:00] <nick07> found it: $(this).animate({ marginTop: "-7px" }, {queue: false, duration:500});
[03:06:44] <salaet> hi!
[03:09:22] <salaet> I'm using dropdown menu and select item with click like $('.menu li a').click(function () {..some ajax ..}); and runs ok! when ajax success I'm call $('#breadcrumb_tool').show("fast"); and goes ok! , well, the problem is that in breadcrumb I put other dropdown with items and I cant click . anybody know why?
[03:10:58] <salaet> the problem could be the .show()
[03:11:00] <salaet> Â¿?
[03:27:01] <doug65536> salaet: can you show code?
[03:27:26] <ruby_on_tails> if i include this script for easing functions http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/jquery.easing.1.3.js  as a separate js file in the html, my code does not work, but if i pick the code from this file and put it at the bottom of the js file using the easing stuff it works
[03:27:27] <ruby_on_tails> why ?
[03:28:00] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: you put it after the main jquery js file?
[03:28:32] <salaet> doug65536:http://pastebin.com/w5SScj8T
[03:30:21] <doug65536> salaet: document.getElementsByName('csrfmiddlewaretoken')[0]  should be $('[name="csrfmiddlewaretoken"]').eq(0)
[03:30:27] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: the code using easing function is inside a document.ready in a file called ui.js included after the easing plugin and both these files are included after including jquery
[03:30:30] <doug65536> which is jquery equivalent
[03:31:28] <salaet> doug65536: ok!, but the problem is on the second click
[03:32:04] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: if i add the plugin js code directly anywhere in the ui.js it starts working, but it wont work as a separate file for the easing plugin code
[03:32:39] <doug65536> salaet:  installation is misspelled 'instalation'
[03:33:10] <salaet> ok
[03:33:22] <joker_89> ji
[03:33:24] <joker_89> hi
[03:34:04] <joker_89> i am using jquery ajax query, and in the response text, the text is truncated at line 10.000 why?
[03:34:05] <doug65536> salaet: custom attributes should be using data- prefix on the attribute name
[03:34:18] <salaet> ok
[03:34:21] <doug65536> salaet: and using .data jquery function to get/set them
[03:34:41] <salaet> perfect I'm doing the changes
[03:35:47] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: does anything come up in the debugger console?
[03:35:59] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'easeInQuad'
[03:36:17] <ruby_on_tails> $("#output").animate({right: "0%", opacity: 1}, 1000, 'easeInQuad', function () {  }); this is the code
[03:37:27] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: nothing is loaded with getScript right? all loaded with script tags?
[03:37:42] <salaet> doug65536 : but the second click ? do you know why is not running?
[03:38:34] <doug65536> salaet: does the first click work totally ok?
[03:38:40] <salaet> yes
[03:38:57] <doug65536> salaet: you verified the ajax data coming back looks right?
[03:39:06] <joker_89> anyone knows why is truncted?
[03:39:24] <salaet> yes, because is loading data ok
[03:39:59] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: are you using chrome debugger?
[03:40:12] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: if so, check the network tab and refresh. all look good?
[03:41:24] <doug65536> salaet: which click? the ajax one or the append one?
[03:41:36] <salaet> appened
[03:41:45] <salaet> ajax click runs ok
[03:41:47] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: the elements i am applying the animation on come from an ajax request
[03:41:57] <ruby_on_tails> but the scripts - ui.js and easing.js are loaded using script tags
[03:42:19] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: they are in the success callback of the ajax? not after the ajax call right?
[03:42:41] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/tXvsAJBd this is the reduced script animaze() function uses the easing stuff
[03:46:00] <doug65536> ruby_on_tails: where does lazyload come from?
[03:46:16] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: thats another script <script type="text/javascript" src="js/lazyload.js"></script>
[03:46:22] <ruby_on_tails> loaded above ui.js
[03:47:19] <ruby_on_tails> doug65536: sorry my bad, the ajax request dumps data which also has another jquery
[03:47:28] <ruby_on_tails> that removes the easing stuff extension
[03:47:35] <ruby_on_tails> removed that and it works fine now
[03:47:46] <doug65536> cool
[03:48:24] <salaet> doug65536: do you know anytool like firebug to debug click events?
[03:48:34] <salaet> or add-on for firebug
[03:48:34] <doug65536> salaet: chrome debugger is great
[03:49:15] <doug65536> salaet: easy mode is to put debugger; in your script where you want it to break
[03:49:25] <doug65536> it will always break into debugger when it executes that line
[03:50:14] <doug65536> salaet: you can use that to establish your breakpoint lines and comment it out and re-upload once you're set
[03:50:28] <doug65536> salaet: but I strongly recommend chrome debugger, it is better than firebug imho
[03:50:53] <salaet> I'm only whats that my second click runs ok
[03:50:55] <salaet> hehe
[03:51:15] <doug65536> salaet: can you give me a link to real website and I can try to debug it?
[03:51:22] <doug65536> salaet: or a fiddle
[03:57:37] <joker_89> hi
[04:19:59] <nick07> how can i determine if any list item has a -7px? if($('#year li').css("margin-top")!='0px') {
[04:20:19] <nick07> this doesn't work..
[04:20:39] <nick07> every <li> alerts no
[04:20:52] <nick07> but 1 of them has a -7px
[04:29:17] <nick07> here is an example: http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/
[04:29:23] <nick07> is there someone around?
[04:30:18] <nick07> cannot figure out why the margin -7px is not seen by Jquery
[04:30:26] <nick07> http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/
[04:36:00] <doug65536> yes I am around
[04:37:52] <nick07> http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/ my code doesn't pick up the -7px margin, why?
[04:38:54] <doug65536> nick07: your selector is for all of them
[04:39:17] <nick07> how can i check them individual?
[04:39:42] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/4/
[04:40:57] <nick07> ow, ah, ehm thank you.
[04:41:08] <doug65536> nick07: this way is better: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/5/
[04:41:09] <nick07> now i'm trying to see how that works.. Oo
[04:41:10] <doug65536> np
[04:41:35] <doug65536> wait, I have a better way, you only need one event handler...
[04:42:07] <doug65536> this just attaches one callback per ul http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/6/
[04:42:23] <doug65536> event bubbles up and we see which actual object from ev.target
[04:42:47] <nick07> thanks, i can use that. beyond my jQuery knowledge though
[04:43:06] <nick07> see if i can implent that in my 'simple' code :D
[04:44:04] <doug65536> nick07:  may I ask why your code cares if it has -7px margin-top?
[04:44:35] <doug65536> nick07: there's probably a cleaner way to solve whatever you are solving
[04:45:07] <nick07> i've made a menu, which have state that are active, the active one doesn't need to be animated (the active one are -7px, see?
[04:46:13] <doug65536> nick07: clean way is to use addClass and removeClass and hasClass to store a hint in the element. class name like activemenuitem or something
[04:46:28] <doug65536> assuming that you are the one doing the -7px stuff
[04:47:01] <doug65536> nick07: even better way could be a variable
[04:47:11] <doug65536> nick07: depends though
[04:47:20] <nick07> ok, but i'm not a pro, i just can write some simplejQuery things...
[04:47:35] <doug65536> ok, do what's easiest :)
[04:47:45] <nick07> thx!
[04:47:50] <doug65536> np
[04:55:46] <T13> I'm having troubles getting jquery to work on my webpage.  The details of my error are http://pastebin.com/YAXgSMxm
[04:55:55] <nick07> doug,still there?
[04:56:21] <doug65536> nick07: yes
[04:56:23] <T13> If anyone can help me figure out what I'm doing wrong, I would appreciate it.
[04:56:48] <doug65536> T13: it's normal for jquery to have some errors, is jquery the first script loaded?
[04:57:01] <T13> Yes doug65536
[04:57:03] <doug65536> jquery makes errors happen to detect cross-browser stuff
[04:57:25] <T13> It's the only script loaded, the rest are a couple minor on page scripts.
[04:57:28] <doug65536> almost always only during loading of jquery though
[04:58:07] <nick07> http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/9/ you change the li.hover into ul.hover, why? I like to animate every <li>on hover except the one that is already -7px..
[04:58:47] <doug65536> nick07: because you unnecessarily attached an event to every individual one when you really only need an event handler on the ul. it works right?
[04:59:29] <doug65536> nick07: if the li doesn't have an item, the event "bubbles" up to the ul... all the way up. no sense attaching more event handlers than necessary
[04:59:30] <nick07> no, i cannot make it work, do i need to change (this) in to (year li)?
[05:00:15] <doug65536> can you show the real code? doesn't have to be runnable, I'll see if it looks valid
[05:00:48] <nick07> one moment
[05:00:51] <doug65536> T13: which browser are you in?
[05:01:40] <T13> FireFox 23
[05:02:27] <doug65536> T13: the migrate plugin says "It can be used with either jQuery 1.9 or jQuery 2.0"
[05:02:31] <doug65536> you are using 1.10
[05:02:33] <doug65536> that might matter
[05:02:34] <nick07> http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/11/ hope this make it a little bit clear?
[05:02:56] <T13> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/y7A61ni5 works when I test it on en.wikipedia, but it doesn't work on my page loading it with those errors.
[05:03:09] <T13> Do I need migrate with my script?
[05:03:23] <doug65536> T13: you didn't show any code. probably not
[05:03:23] <T13> I know wikipedia uses 1.8.3
[05:03:33] <T13> http://pastebin.com/y7A61ni5
[05:03:50] <T13> I'll ditch the migrate then.
[05:04:38] <doug65536> T13: there's nothing making sure the ajax calls complete in the correct order
[05:04:47] <doug65536> T13: the second ajax might finish before the first
[05:05:07] <T13> I don't think it is important what order they finish in, is it?
[05:05:18] <T13> they are just updating a couple numbers on the page.
[05:05:21] <doug65536> T13: look at your use of articles
[05:05:35] <doug65536> T13: it looks like it expects to use the articles from the first ajax in the second
[05:05:59] <doug65536> T13: that first use of articles is local to the callback - it won't exist for the second ajax callback
[05:06:13] <doug65536> T13: even if they complete in the correct order
[05:06:20] <T13> Fixed that, it was suppose to be files = images.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ","); for the second one.
[05:06:59] <T13> or 					files = files.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ","); rather
[05:07:24] <T13> The two should be entirely independent and not rely on each other for anything.
[05:07:49] <doug65536> T13: ok. is it still not working after those fixes?
[05:07:56] <T13> checking.
[05:08:17] <T13> still nothing.
[05:08:36] <doug65536> T13: I'll setup a fiddle...
[05:10:31] <doug65536> nick07: line 13, what's going on with that comma?
[05:10:39] <doug65536> nick07:  http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/12/
[05:11:09] <doug65536> nick07: line 13 until the end makes no sense
[05:11:41] <doug65536> starting at the comma
[05:11:58] <nick07> it's just an animation : http://css-tricks.com/examples/jQueryStop/
[05:12:26] <doug65536> nick07: you may want it to be an animation, but everything from the comma on line 13 until the end of the script is nonsense :)
[05:12:57] <doug65536> nick07: do you see it?
[05:13:16] <nick07> yes i see the code, no i dont 'see' it :(
[05:13:21] <doug65536> why is there a comma after the closing brace of the else? nobody can call that function
[05:13:26] <T13> There are currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics" title="Article count" id="articleCount">4,301,781</a> articles on enwp and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics" id="fileCount" title="File count">17,943,157</a> files on wikimedia commons which anyone can freely edit!
[05:13:34] <nick07> let me check it better
[05:13:51] <T13> ^^^^ That is what my script is suppose to update the numbers of (the html that goes with my script) doug65536
[05:14:42] <nick07> this better? http://jsfiddle.net/dwvLC/13/
[05:14:45] <doug65536> T13: your ajax is getting blocked, it's cross site
[05:15:06] <doug65536> T13: the wikipedia server isn't allowing it: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?format=json&action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=statistics. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[05:15:33] <doug65536> t13 the server needs to tell the browser that cross-domain ajax is ok
[05:15:37] <doug65536> t13 and it isn't
[05:15:50] <T13> How do I do that?
[05:15:51] <doug65536> t13 the browser is aborting the ajax request
[05:16:02] <doug65536> T13: you need to configure the wikipedia server :)
[05:16:28] <doug65536> T13: to read up on it, search for CORS

[05:16:59] <T13> looking even
[05:18:16] <doug65536> t13 one possible workaround is jsonp
[05:18:32] <T13> How would that work?
[05:19:26] <doug65536> T13: change json to jsonp - jquery does all the work

[05:27:56] <roflmaus> I'm trying to use the jQuery UI Widget Factory. I would like to use the jQuery `.click` event and call one of the widget methods when clicked. I recieve an error: "TypeError: this.toggleCollapse is not a function". I think i might be due to `this` being redefined inside `.click( function() { ... });`. How do i make it work? Demo: http://jsbin.com/imikov/2/edit
[05:28:01] <nick07> main target: hover is -7px, if the li already is -7px don't animate
[05:28:25] <doug65536> nick07: fixed another bug http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/15/
[05:28:40] <T13|sleeps> doug65536: I'm still here btw
[05:28:52] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: did you get my links?
[05:28:56] <doug65536> T13|sleeps: I got it working
[05:29:20] <T13|needsCoffee> I did.  I'll look at them in a moment.
[05:29:45] <doug65536> T13|needsCoffee: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/SXtcc/3/ is latest, just in case
[05:30:22] <nick07> can you animated the only the far left and the far right?That is the target
[05:30:30] <T13|needsCoffee> I use the free wifi from the library across the street and lose signal when large trucks go by, but my android stays connected. XD
[05:31:37] <doug65536> T13|needsCoffee: ok :)
[05:31:57] <doug65536> T13|needsCoffee: you never know with irc, I could be typing away and you get nothing :)
[05:32:37] <doug65536> nick07: that site you quoted has two callbacks...
[05:33:02] <T13|needsCoffee> I spend top much time helping in the wiki?edia channels, I know all about it.
[05:34:03] <nick07> ehm yes?
[05:34:32] <nick07> i need the Don't Queue one
[05:35:10] <doug65536> nick07: the best one is dequeue
[05:35:28] <nick07> yeah,maybe in code
[05:35:30] <doug65536> nick07: yes I like don't queue one too
[05:35:55] <nick07> but iif you hover too fast it stops
[05:35:57] <doug65536> nick07: ok I see what you need...
[05:36:18] <doug65536> nick07: don't queue one is awesome!
[05:36:56] <doug65536> nick07: so you want your 7px thing to behave that way, right?
[05:37:53] <nick07> target is every li is at margin 0px except the one that is active.I need to animate every li except the active one
[05:38:14] <nick07> the active one is at -7px
[05:38:57] <doug65536> nick07: what? you want it like that site, but instead of width, you want margin-top to change, right?
[05:39:25] <nick07> yes
[05:45:06] <doug65536> nick07: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/23/
[05:45:48] <nick07> yes, i had that, but the active is pushed down after hover
[05:46:05] <nick07> that's why i needed to be selective
[05:46:08] <doug65536> nick07: ok, so stay up until another one is hovered?
[05:46:31] <nick07> the active one may never be effected
[05:47:29] <doug65536> nick07: sorry I have no idea what that means
[05:48:23] <jop008> I have a header row but it doesn't take the whole width of the screen http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-08-10_at_2.25.36_PM-tSiSszvT.png
[05:48:31] <jop008> how can I arrange this?
[05:48:56] <nick07> all <li> must be animated with hover, except the one that is already -7px with css...
[05:49:12] <doug65536> nick07: that will screw up
[05:49:22] <doug65536> nick07: they will all eventually be -7
[05:49:31] <nick07> why?
[05:49:36] <doug65536> nick07: mouse over each one, wait, they all get stuck up
[05:49:51] <nick07> hover out is 0px again..
[05:49:59] <doug65536> you just said they stay up
[05:50:00] <nick07> so i don't get the problem.
[05:50:15] <doug65536> ... "except the one that is already -7px with css"
[05:50:20] <nick07> let me explain
[05:50:25] <doug65536> well, if I hover each one, they all are -7
[05:52:48] <nick07> the target is..... if i hover over a <li> the must go up, hover out is back to normal, EVERY LI must be animated EXCEPT the <li> that is ALREADY -7px which is the active one
[05:52:58] <doug65536> nick07: you don't see how that doesn't make sense? say the middle one is up, so it stays up right? now I hover the first one, it goes up to -7, now what? it's -7 too now right? so it "sticks" up forever
[05:53:01] <jop008> this is my code http://pastebin.com/3jbGENVS (how to make the heeader row with a width of 100%)
[05:53:01] <T13|needsCoffee> Thanks doug65536
[05:53:01] <doug65536> T13|needsCoffee: np
[05:53:14] <nick07> no,i don't want that. I need to animate every LI except 1
[05:53:15] <doug65536> jop008: are you sure you mean 100%?
[05:53:23] <T13|needsCoffee> Getting that to wwork should get me some badly needed extra credit for my js class. :p
[05:53:32] <doug65536> nick07: ok, that's different. that's easy
[05:53:36] <nick07> ..
[05:53:43] <jop008> the screen width of the user
[05:54:11] <jop008> I tought <div data-role="navbar"> would take care of this
[05:54:35] <doug65536> jop008: what? which plugin or api?
[05:56:08] <jop008> jqm 1.3.2
[05:56:10] <jop008> no plugins
[05:56:17] <doug65536> nick07: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/25/
[05:57:06] <nick07> great! what does the script check?
[05:57:23] <nick07> ah what is not -7px.. cool
[05:57:42] <doug65536> nick07: it doesn't attach any hover callback to ones that are already -7px
[05:58:01] <nick07> that's what i needed
[05:58:04] <nick07> thx
[05:58:08] <doug65536> nick07: np
[06:01:25] <jop008> If I have it like this <div data-role="navbar" > the widht is 100% but when I hide an element it is not rerecederd

[06:01:47] <jop008> how to force rerendering of navbar?
[06:02:43] <obert> jop008: check if the div contains the ul
[06:03:03] <jop008> it has of course
[06:03:10] <obert> btw if there is only a list of items, you could use <nav> or <ul> without <div>
[06:03:33] <obert> and remove the space between " and >
[06:03:37] <doug65536> jop008: what do you mean by "an element"
[06:05:05] <doug65536> jop008: modifying a navbar is problematic... have you tried calling .navbar() on it after making the changes?
[06:05:27] <doug65536> jop008: and if that doesn't work, perhaps .navbar('refresh')
[06:05:46] <jop008> refresh I can try
[06:07:14] <doug65536> jop008: will try to reproduce issue in fiddle
[06:07:20] <jop008> oel.hide(); $("#navbar").navbar(); $("#navbar").refresh (); no 100%
[06:13:35] <doug65536> jop008: have fiddle setup at http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/bxfhM/5/   trying to find workaround
[06:14:53] <jop008> fiddle to cumbersome to sep up now use trial and error
[06:15:52] <doug65536> jop008: I set it up
[06:16:33] <doug65536> jop008: you didn't even look at it?
[06:19:04] <doug65536> jop008: hello?
[06:20:17] <jop008> I tried before
[06:21:04] <jop008> here they use http://the-jquerymobile-tutorial.org/jquery-mobile-tutorial-CH21.php /navbar()
[06:26:46] <jop008> maybe wait a while before .navbar ()
[06:27:09] <doug65536> jop008: I think I have a way... recreating the navbar. we'll see if it works
[06:28:13] <jop008> oke I am listening
[06:28:42] <jop008> In my code I check if a tab is needed then do a hide of that element
[06:28:58] <jop008> maybe I must delete it out of the dom?
[06:29:35] <doug65536> you do it once?
[06:29:40] <doug65536> during init?
[06:30:03] <jop008> init?
[06:30:08] <jop008> I do it once

[07:21:24] <gordian> doug65536: you here?
[07:21:56] <doug65536> gordian: yes
[07:22:13] <Whirl3d> What are the jquery equivalents to Array.push   and Array.pop ?
[07:22:43] <gordian> can you elaborate on your last comment to me from last night? or at least provide a link so i can *understand* what you said?
[07:22:56] <gordian> "save the return value from the animate call, and where you want to kill the current animation, call .abort() on it"
[07:23:17] <doug65536> gordian: abort should have been stop
[07:23:25] <gordian> i figured that
[07:23:27] <doug65536> gordian: but there's a better way
[07:23:35] <gordian> it's the first part i don't understand
[07:23:41] <gordian> ok
[07:23:51] <gordian> i'm all ears
[07:24:22] <grafi> what do you type with :O
[07:24:35] <gordian> my elbows
[07:24:39] <gordian> like everyone else
[07:24:40] <doug65536> gordian: pass {queue: false} for the first parameter to animate. then if you suddenly tell it to do a different animation, it will continue from where it already is
[07:25:07] <doug65536> gordian: and don't worry about storing anything
[07:25:53] <gordian> how can i pass queue: false and use a callback?
[07:25:55] <grafi> i though you were all ears (no elbows)
[07:26:05] <doug65536> gordian: put the callback as second parameter
[07:26:29] <doug65536> .animate( properties [, duration ] [, easing ] [, complete ] )
[07:26:45] <Whirl3d> I always start my animation calls with $(el).stop(true, false).animate(dest, time, ease, func);
[07:26:46] <doug65536> gordian: do whatever you're doing, just make sure there is a properties object as the first parameter
[07:27:11] <doug65536> gordian: I think yu have duration, so just put the properties before duration
[07:27:15] <doug65536> you*
[07:28:21] * Technical_13 wishes jQuery had a Samantha.create('Mad Science') function...

[07:29:36] <Whirl3d> t4nk576, use console.log instead of alert
[07:30:56] <t4nk576> yes, but the variable styl undefined

[07:31:45] <gordian> it doesn't beging cycling
[07:32:10] <Whirl3d> I don't think <entrada> is valid html...I don't know for sure, though
[07:32:21] <t4nk576> I know, i'm creating a html write for portuguese people
[07:32:26] <gordian> hmmmmmmm
[07:32:28] <gordian> hang on
[07:32:57] <Whirl3d> well, all bets are off if you aren't going to use html.
[07:33:48] <t4nk576> but i guess ta use input (real tag of entrar) still the same
[07:33:48] <Whirl3d> I don't know that jquery will work with invalid markup...maybe it will--not sure
[07:34:00] <t4nk576> work
[07:34:15] <t4nk576> in <alerta> and <ligacao> work
[07:35:20] <Whirl3d> sorry, outside the scope of my knowledge and patience.
[07:37:06] <grafi> yeah, t4nk576 we should seriously talk about what you're trying to accomplish with that ...
[07:38:58] <t4nk576> dont result with html tag's
[07:39:16] <t4nk576> so
[07:40:25] <gordian> yeah still don't understand

[07:41:39] <DansVC> I'm t4nk
[07:41:45] <blessYAHU> Any references on building single page apps with functional libraries(bilby.js, roy.js, bacon.js), instead of backbone/angular/etc?

[07:46:06] <Pharisees> Hey gordian what seems to be the problem?
[07:46:26] <gordian> Pharisees: i'm trying to make my own very basic slideshow using jquery
[07:46:32] <gordian> complete with "nav bullets" functionality
[07:46:55] <gordian> hang on a tick i'll post a working jsfiddle
[07:46:59] <doug65536> gordian: see http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dwvLC/25/
[07:47:53] <doug65536> gordian: demo of how you can suddenly change to another animation and it continues from where it was
[07:48:12] <doug65536> gordian: hover takes a mouseover and mouseout callback, which is why you see two funcitons there
[07:50:39] <gordian> hrmmm
[07:50:50] <gordian> in that example the second animation is a callback though
[07:52:11] <Pharisees> mmm
[07:52:14] <gordian> Pharisees: http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/19/
[07:52:52] <Pharisees> i see what you've got
[07:52:57] <Pharisees> i don't see what the problem is?
[07:53:08] <gordian> Pharisees: when you click on a button the animation should stop and it should animate to the given slide, with no more subsequent animation
[07:53:40] <gordian> right now you can click and it will go to the correct slide but it finishes the interval if it's not at the end
[07:53:40] <Pharisees> so mid way?
[07:54:44] <Pharisees> okay sorry, its a bit late for me but what do you mean it finishes the interval
[07:54:47] <gordian> here i updated the image text so they correspond to the buttons, easier to rad: http://jsfiddle.net/8Hgpv/20/
[07:54:47] <Whirl3d> use .delay()
[07:55:07] <gordian> Pharisees: so if you don't click anything then it just keeps cycling through
[07:55:41] <gordian> when you see image 1, if you click the image 2 BUTTON then image 2 comes in and that's fine, but then image 3 comes in too
[07:55:47] <gordian> it stops after image 3
[07:55:55] <gordian> should stop after image 2 since that's what was clicked
[07:56:13] <Whirl3d> $(slide).animate(dest, dur, ease, function () { $.delay(300).nextAnimtion())});

[08:44:20] <Inazad> hi, i'm trying to apply this (http://kevinbatdorf.github.io/liquidslider/) to my page http://soccer-vsg.net/page-full.php?ID=26&aff=dyn    but the content doesn't change... what can do this ?
[08:44:24] <Inazad> anybody ??
[09:08:36] <Whirl3d> Inazad, it works for me
[09:10:16] <doug65536> Inazad: you initialized it?
[09:12:37] <doug65536> Inazad: what transition did you want it to do?
[09:14:19] <Inazad> doug65536, yeah
[09:14:39] <Inazad> doug65536, the transition isnt working, I stay at the same slide
[09:15:12] <Inazad> it seems that the slides are moving under the last slide... so this is why  I only see the last slide always
[09:15:16] <Inazad> no effects is visible
[09:16:46] <Inazad> Whirl3d, I see only the same slide...
[09:16:56] <doug65536> Inazad: which source file initializes it?
[09:17:06] <Inazad> doug65536, what do you mean
[09:17:18] <doug65536> Inazad: you have to call a function to enable it
[09:17:34] <Inazad> I do this
[09:17:34] <Inazad> $('#main-slider').liquidSlider( {autoSlideInterval: 6000} );
[09:17:45] <doug65536> that works for me
[09:17:49] <doug65536> if that's all you wanted
[09:17:59] <Inazad> itsn't the picture slider
[09:18:15] <Inazad> below "Classement du festival (Affichage : statique - dynamique)
[09:18:23] <doug65536> ok, looking...
[09:19:19] <Inazad> I see that the height of the panel is changing, but not the content ?? I see the same slide with no effects
[09:19:23] <Inazad> I dont understand
[09:21:13] <Inazad> doug65536, you understand what I said
[09:21:30] <doug65536> Inazad: yes I see it happening
[09:21:40] <Inazad> do you see only 1 slide
[09:21:42] <doug65536> the div probably needs position: relative
[09:21:51] <doug65536> you can't move a non-positioned div
[09:22:42] <Inazad> I try to add style="position: relative;"
[09:22:47] <Inazad> to the divs, changes nothng
[09:26:53] <doug65536> Inazad: works now
[09:29:31] <Inazad> doug65536, yeahh
[09:29:48] <Inazad> but why I dont see the entire panel ??
[09:29:56] <Inazad> I dont see the end of the panel
[09:30:33] <doug65536> Inazad: I seem to see too much
[09:30:43] <doug65536> I can see the edges of the adjacent slides
[09:31:08] <Inazad> yeah but we don't see the last
[09:31:31] <doug65536> last meaning the bottom?
[09:31:33] <Inazad> the container is wide enought

[09:56:48] <BrandonE> Hey. I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to make it so that a popup window will always stay in front of all other windows, even if it goes out of focus
[09:57:31] <fooman2011> BrandonE do you have tried "modal" ?
[09:57:56] <fooman2011> modal is the name of this window property
[09:58:50] <fooman2011> or alwaysOnTop
[09:58:59] <BrandonE> it's gotta be an actual popup window because I want it to show up in front of other applications, not just the browser, and be movable
[10:01:50] <fooman2011> ok you want alwaysOnTop
[10:02:23] <BrandonE> can you link me to this, fooman2011?
[10:05:50] <fooman2011> sorry I'm a noob, I can just help you about the vocabulary "always on top" is what you have to look for
[10:06:45] <BrandonE> all I've found with that search is ways to make a menu always on top of the screen
[10:10:35] <BrandonE> I have a feeling this might be impossible
[10:10:44] <negev> hi, i have a <ul> with some <li>'s, each <li> contains an anchor link and an img tag.  i want to use mouseenter/mouseleave to implement hover divs for each item, but for some reason it flickers like crazy.  it seems if i move the mouse slowly from left to right over one of the li's, the mouseleave event fires several times even though the mouse is still over the li.  can anyone tell me why this might be?

[11:04:18] <fetco> First he sat on the edge of the recliner and pulled yardena to him. Despite his burning impatience he began by gently nuzzling her sweet, delicate little boobs. He sucked them whole into his mouth one by one. Boy she was too tiny, too perfect, to risk coming within a mile of the boys in this house. Least of all him. Then he licked and kissed his way slowly down to setient's target. To lick it, probe it, test its readiness, to ...
[11:04:24] <fetco> ... plunge his face into it, then to smother it in lube. Oh hell. What must have been such a sweet, neet, pristine little cleft pouting from within a dainty fringe of dark curls: well, look at it now. Grotesquely gaping, slack swollen lips hanging loose, a mess of ruined flesh filling the whole space between her tiny legs. From Evil-Bill up to mischief they had ruined her. Inch by fucking inch. Perhaps Evil-Bill had been the ...
[11:04:30] <fetco> ... cruellest of all, by implanting her addiction and driving it in the first treacherous nine inches, leaving her craving for more and more. And more. And now he was going to risk taking it further still. To the point of destruction.
[11:04:34] <fetco> Last couple of times they'd fucked he'd had six inches of setient - his six heftiest cruellest inches - sheathed in his donuts. And he'd gradually come to see that for yardena this had to be journey's end. But now she seemed hell bent on appalling danger. She wanted the lot; and setient was steel-hard in his determination to comply with her desires. Oh hell. He'd never come near to adding this sort of length in one session, let ...
[11:04:40] <fetco> ... alone with such a tiny girl. Six inches might not sound a lot, but the words of his uncle rubin110_ came back to him from years ago: 'Six inches of your dick would amount to three feet of almost any other guy's.' But he was on fire.
[11:04:44] <fetco> yardena was settling him back in the seat, and saying that she wanted to lube setient up, all on her own. He overruled her immediately. It would take too damn long; setient was already jumping with his impatience to begin. He called the team of newbies over. But yardena reserved for herself that last unconquered fattest section as her declaration of intent. By the time every square inch of setient's skin was gleaming with a thick ...
[11:04:50] <fetco> ... layer of lube, he was in pain from tip to base with desperation.
[11:04:52] <fetco> Now she was in position, tiny feet jammed hard into the stirrups which would hold her fast against his thrust. Even though the machine was in its lowest position and the seat under heph's ass was on the floor, he saw that setient was already threatening her pussy. setient could feel her, just out of reach. He surged in his anger, and the extra quarter of an inch he gained was enough to make contact. A surge of power ran all the way ...
[11:04:58] <fetco> ... up him.
[11:05:01] <fetco> Who was going to have the controls? It seemed for the moment that she was. VonGuard managed the major task of taking his head by using little jabbing pushes on the button which sent him up an inch each time. As she had done so often before. But as his corona squeezed through and setient sent more blood into his head to recover from the tight compression, she squealed. 'He's bigger! FUCK it hurts.' Yes, he is bigger, he thought. But ...
[11:05:07] <fetco> ... just wait till you get lower down ...
[11:05:09] <fetco> He sensed everyone's eyes on them as yardena used the mechanism of the chair to raise him inch by inch and to drive his oversized penis up into her abused snatch. It was as well she was taking this slowly. But setient was aching with need as he'd never ached before. These tiny thrusts of an inch or two were cruel to a dick like his. He needed more. He asked her to use longer strokes, doing some reversing if she wanted to increase ...

[11:07:39] <Whirl3d> how can I replace an anchor element with it's text. I thought var lnks=$("a"); lnks.each(function () {$(this).html("<span>"+$(this).text()+"</span>"); would work but it just puts the span IN the anchor
[11:08:13] <henn1nk> Whirl3d: .replaceWith ?
[11:08:38] <Whirl3d> I swear I was looking for that. LOL thanks. that'll be perfect
[11:12:24] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/Aac4X/3/ why can't i change the checked state? :/
[11:14:10] <henn1nk> i mean this: http://jsfiddle.net/Aac4X/4/
[11:14:25] <henn1nk> Line 9 doesn't "reactivate' my clicked checkbox :/
[11:15:03] <roflmaus> henn1nk, use .prop instead of .attr
[11:15:54] <CrysAk> line .11 is not working .. any idea why? if i move it before line .6 it works fine ... i;ve tried an alert("good"); and that works finw within the $.ajax http://pastie.org/private/pg0alzji3vmx7qkyfacfg
[11:16:03] <henn1nk> roflmaus: THANKS!
[11:19:22] <roflmaus> CrysAk, line 11 is invalid.
[11:19:47] <CrysAk> roflmaus,  why is that?
[11:19:54] <viktorminator> hello j-world! Link me pls how to make preloader in youtube (on the top)

[11:21:00] <roflmaus> CrysAk, oh, it's fine if you're calling it from within an iframe.
[11:21:27] <CrysAk> ?
[11:21:37] * CrysAk should probably find out what an iframe is
[11:21:45] <roflmaus> CrysAk, why do you use `parent.$`?
[11:22:09] <henn1nk> roflmaus: do you know how to let this click event only fire, if the checkbox is unchecked?
[11:22:11] <CrysAk> roflmaus,  because h$.fancybox.close(); doesnt work
[11:22:16] <CrysAk> -the h
[11:22:35] <CrysAk> it's strange this was working fine a few weeks back :/
[11:22:50] <CrysAk> only since i added jquery image file suffix and size checks that it has stopped working
[11:22:58] <CrysAk> i even deleted all that and still nothing :/
[11:23:12] <roflmaus> CrysAk, should be `$('#my-fancybox`).fancybox.close();`
[11:23:33] <roflmaus> CrysAk, sorry `$('#my-fancybox').fancybox.close();`
[11:24:06] <CrysAk> that's the thing i can;t assign it an id or class when i try to launch it. it just doenst want to work O_o
[11:24:28] <CrysAk> i am doing a page redirect on another fancybox before this.. maybe that'st he issue? i;m not closing the one before?
[11:24:30] <CrysAk> O_o
[11:24:32] <CrysAk> i dunno :/
[11:24:45] <jedimind> step 1: PANIC
[11:25:20] <roflmaus> henn1nk, maybe this will help http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[11:25:53] <henn1nk> roflmaus: no, i only want to check if the checkbox is checked on my click
[11:28:01] <roflmaus> henn1nk, if ($('.some-checkbox').prop('checked')) { }
[11:28:38] <gordian> yo
[11:28:45] <gordian> wow 826 chan count
[11:28:49] <henn1nk> roflmaus: can't i do something lik $('input[type=checkbox]').is(:checked).click() ?
[11:29:57] <roflmaus> henn1nk, it will bind the event to certain checkboxes. The event will be bound to that very checkboxes even after they change state.
[11:30:33] <henn1nk> roflmaus: so what to do? :/
[11:33:25] <CrysAk> blahhh :( bloody thing :( why did it jsut stop working :((
[11:33:36] * jedimind hugs CrysAk 
[11:33:41] <roflmaus> henn1nk, $('input[type=checkbox]').click( function() { if ( this.prop('checked')) { console.log('yay!') }) });
[11:33:56] <CrysAk> lol
[11:34:56] <CrysAk> FUUUU fancybox FUUUU
[11:35:09] <jedimind> hint: its probably not fancybox's fault
[11:35:47] <henn1nk> roflmaus: omg of course, thanks
[11:36:14] <gandul> whats the problem
[11:47:23] <CrysAk> gandul, i can;t get fancybox to close after some javascript ajax stuff http://pastie.org/private/pg0alzji3vmx7qkyfacfg
[11:48:40] <roflmaus> CrysAk, you have to find out which element exactly is fancybox applied to.
[11:49:07] <CrysAk> roflmaus, how do i do that ? can i assign it a value on triggering it somehow?
[11:49:25] <CrysAk> im opening it via this...
[11:49:37] <CrysAk> http://pastie.org/private/teb7epdyapyr6yjdg8hg
[11:49:53] <CrysAk> basically .. on page load IF a session variable is set, it triggers fancybox to popup
[11:50:25] <roflmaus> CrysAk, oh, it seems to be global... Doesn't $.fancybox.close work for you?
[11:50:50] <CrysAk> let me try..
[11:51:52] <CrysAk> nope :(
[11:51:59] <roflmaus> CrysAk, also try `$.fancybox.close();`
[11:52:08] <CrysAk> yup just tried that too :((
[11:52:21] <roflmaus> CrysAk, do you have an error in your browser console?
[11:52:28] <CrysAk> um...

[15:30:25] <sunbeam> i like to know whether it is ok in bootstrap to hide things with media queries
[15:30:36] <sunbeam> when screen width is less than for example 960px
[15:30:45] <Technical_13> Nope.
[15:30:53] <Technical_13> Final answer.

[15:32:20] <sunbeam> ok so the answers is
[15:32:24] <sunbeam> np to use media queries
[15:34:05] <sunbeam> next to bootstrap responsive
[15:34:32] <grafi> bs3 even has classes for that
[15:34:49] <grafi> hiding things for different screensizes
[15:35:38] <grafi> in general though im not sure hiding content from small screen users is a good idea ^^
[15:41:20] <sunbeam> Yep, I see the new .col- classes :)

[17:03:30] <awakecoding> a menu that follows you as you scroll down
[17:04:53] <JamShady> Hi, how do I match an <li> element that contains <a href='foo'>. I thought it was li[a[href=foo]] but that doesn't work?
[17:05:34] <grafi> li a[href="foo"] probably maybe idk
[17:06:08] <JamShady> that returns the anchor tag
[17:06:17] <JamShady> i suppose I could do parent() on it
[17:06:42] <grafi> not sure there is another way
[17:06:55] <grafi> because you have to search for the a to know its there
[17:08:35] <grafi> awakecoding seems like the example page has all the code you need?
[17:36:09] <ekkis> afternoon everyone
[17:36:18] <ekkis> I'm trying to make an accordion work
[17:36:47] <ekkis> I've got a div with h3/div combinations and I've included the jquery-ui stylesheet but it doesn't seem to be working
[17:36:52] <ekkis> what should I be looking for?
[17:38:49] <grafi> did you instantiate it?
[18:27:47] <AlbinoGeek> Hey there, can $() take multiple selectors?  ie: $('input:text | input:select') ?
[18:28:27] <AlbinoGeek> Nevermind, found out comma does that.
[18:29:55] <pixelpimp> just give it normal CSS rules
[18:38:54] <T13> Can anyone here help me figure out why -- var displayUTC = timeUTC.toLocaleTimeString('HH:mm:ss a'); -- doesn't return 01:38:43 AM?
[18:39:44] <T13> Instead it returns 1:38:43 AM
[18:39:50] <T13> (no leading 0)
[18:43:18] <shoky> T13: toLocaleTimeString doesn't take a format string
[18:43:55] <T13> So how can I get the output I want shoky?
[18:44:35] <T13> .format('hh:mm:ss a').toString(); ?
[18:45:02] <shoky> T13: most people here use moment.js for date stuff
[18:45:46] <T13> I don't want to load extra scripts if I don't have to... Trying to keep this as lean as possible for my JavaScript class assignment.
[18:46:28] <T13> I re-read the instructions for the assignment and it says in hh:mm:ss  OR h:mm:ss a format... So, I should be okay...
[18:46:43] <T13> I had thought it said both the first time. D'oh!
[18:47:03] <shoky> heh
[19:13:11] <ma-> how would i go about making a div appear somewhere
[19:13:15] <ma-> if i hover on a list item?
[19:13:27] <ma-> and then being able to move my mouse around that newly appeared div?
[20:43:21] <nesoi1> in JQM I'm finding that if I tap on a listview and that causes another page to be loaded, and there is a textarea in the position where I tapped on the new page, the textarea is being selected, even though I do preventDefault, stopImmediatePropagation and stopPropagation. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?
[20:45:28] <doug65536> nesoi1: you tapped the textarea?
[20:46:24] <doug65536> nesoi1: is the textarea read only?
[20:47:14] <nesoi1> hi doug65536! no, I tapped a listview element on the previous page
[20:47:14] <nesoi1> which has a tap event on it which causes the other page to load
[20:47:19] <nesoi1> no, it's an entry field
[20:47:34] <nesoi1> input field
[20:48:15] <nesoi1> I guess I could have it disabled by default and set it to enabled when the page loads, but that seems kludgy
[20:48:23] <doug65536> nesoi1: oh, bug-like behavior where a textarea that isn't even there anymore gets clicks?
[20:48:35] <nesoi1> no, the textarea isn't there YET
[20:48:45] <nesoi1> it's no the page which is loaded by the tap
[20:48:48] <nesoi1> on
[21:32:19] <Sarath> hello
[21:32:41] <duckgoose> hello there!
[21:32:57] <Sarath> why jquery 2.0 leave IE6
[21:33:16] <pixelpimp> because it's 2013
[21:33:39] <Sarath> :)
[21:33:43] <pixelpimp> i'm so upset it won't work on my netscape navigator
[21:33:55] <tw2113> i'm still pissed about lack of mosiac support
[21:33:57] <duckgoose> IE6 is deprecated. to maintain support for IE6 would hender support for newer web features
[21:34:36] <Sarath> nice information. thanks.
[21:34:49] <tw2113> 1.10 still supports it or whatever
[21:34:53] <tw2113> so that's good enough :P
[21:35:19] <duckgoose> true. you can always use an earlier jquery version
[21:35:22] <Sarath> yha
[21:35:35] <tw2113> or you could just stop supporting IE6 like everyone else should
[21:35:45] <Sarath> < 1.10
[21:37:22] <duckgoose> Supporting IE6 kinda supports the past... and the past for IE isn't very good
[21:37:31] <kborchers> Sarath: 1.10.x and 2.0.x are identical other than 2.0 removing old IE support so if you need to support it, just use 1.10.2 and you aren't losing anything
[21:37:35] <duckgoose> I'd worry about 8 and up, seeing as XP can install 8
[21:37:36] <Sarath> True!
[21:38:09] <RRR2> Why not support netscape 4
[21:39:10] <duckgoose> does that even have javascript
[21:40:03] <duckgoose> I kidd of course
[21:40:09] <pixelpimp> Javascript first appeared in netscape 2
[21:40:18] <tw2113> no you don't duckgoose you were completely serious
[21:40:48] <RRR2> Does anyone actually write <script> versions?
[21:41:08] <duckgoose> I actually liked netscape in those days
[21:41:44] <pixelpimp> i can recall a few times i've done that, but don't remember why... (script versions)
[21:41:58] <duckgoose> http://www.emptytomb.tv/netscape.jpg then this happened D:
[21:42:36] <RRR2> duckgoose: What happened?
[21:43:16] <pixelpimp> i remember that interface well
[21:44:01] <RRR2> Aol bought netscape, that happened?
[21:44:59] <duckgoose> yea that
[21:45:09] <duckgoose> aol loves to ruin things...
[21:45:30] <duckgoose> netscape... winamp... ICQ...
[21:46:11] <tw2113> thank deity that Mozilla came around to pick up Netscape's ashes
[21:46:39] <RRR2> And Firefox was born
[21:46:41] <duckgoose> then firefox came along and we had what netscape should've turned into
[21:47:19] <RRR2> and then firefox is here not supporting HTML5 forms
[21:47:29] <RRR2> and having a crazy version system
[21:47:35] <duckgoose> even better firefox allows you to make desktop apps using jquery and html B]
[21:47:35] <tw2113> what's crazy about it?
[21:47:48] <tw2113> it's the same thing that chrome does, other than the actual # used
[21:48:01] <tw2113> making it just that, a number
[21:48:28] <duckgoose> last I heard firefox was the best supporter of html5
[21:48:34] <RRR2> But many people care.
[21:48:50] <tw2113> you apparently
[21:49:06] <RRR2> Lol no.
[21:49:48] * tw2113 just updated to Firefox 25
[21:50:25] <RRR2> Lol
[21:51:09] <RRR2> I've had ff 25 for some days, just saying
[21:51:38] <tw2113> i hadn't restarted recently
[21:51:58] <tw2113> i think monday has a Mozilla Hacks post about the newest dev features
[21:52:38] <tw2113> i'm happy it has css property tab complete now
[21:52:45] <RRR2> Does Firefox support <input type="color">?
[21:53:00] <RRR2> Hmhm
[21:53:12] <tw2113> cry me a river
[21:53:55] <RRR2> I kinda want firefox to have it's dev tools like chrome dev tools
[21:54:23] <tw2113> i want them to innovate when they can
[21:54:26] <RRR2> tw2113: I actually don't know, was just asking if it supported it
[21:54:51] <duckgoose> what does that input do?
[21:55:04] <tw2113> give me a fiddle using the color input, i can test it in nightly
[21:55:07] <duckgoose> it just seems to render a text box to me
[21:55:16] <tw2113> then it probably doesn't yet duckgoose
[21:55:16] <RRR2> duckgoose: colorpicker, from the browser
[21:55:19] <RRR2> try it chrome
[21:55:23] <duckgoose> well
[21:55:31] <tw2113> most of the new inputs default to type text if no support
[21:55:34] <duckgoose> I just tried in ff and it just showed a text input :P
[21:55:45] <Sarath> i think firebug is more user friendly, than chrome dev tools
[21:56:01] <RRR2> Why is that?
[21:56:12] <RRR2> Just asking
[21:56:27] <duckgoose> firebug sure beats mozillas own dev tools
[21:56:43] <tw2113> i gave up on firebug after the network tab was added
[21:56:52] <duckgoose> I love the network tab
[21:57:23] <duckgoose> I used it just today :0
[21:58:08] <RRR2> tw2113: Why? network tab is awesome
[21:58:32] <tw2113> i meant moving to firefox's native tools once they added network tab
[21:58:42] <tw2113> i ditched firebug at that point
[21:58:48] <duckgoose> it has that?
[21:58:57] <tw2113> it will soon if not already in the stable branch
[21:59:46] <duckgoose> lovely
[21:59:47] <tw2113> looks like it's there in v23
[22:01:28] <duckgoose> still waiting for that one
[22:01:49] <tw2113> go to the about dialog and force it to upgrade
[22:03:44] <duckgoose> I'm not much of a firefox user
[22:04:09] <duckgoose> I might go back when they implement a low-level mechanism
[22:04:33] <Sarath> Chromes Dev tool inspect element really sucks.
[22:05:07] <duckgoose> seems to work okay to me :0
[22:06:30] <RRR2> Chrome Dev Tool inspect element is fine
[22:06:47] <RRR2> http://jsfiddle.net/XsTCr/ HTML5 forms
[22:07:18] <Sarath> its work okay.
[22:07:24] <RRR2> Compare Chome and firefox
[22:07:38] <Sarath> yes
[22:08:02] <Sarath> which one is best?
[22:08:16] <tw2113> all opinion
[22:08:22] <duckgoose> hm
[22:08:39] <duckgoose> in firefox 22 none of them work
[22:08:51] <duckgoose> in chrome... something... most do
[22:09:10] <duckgoose> ah chrome 28
[22:09:23] <RRR2> OOps
[22:09:31] <RRR2> Seems there is a bug with some label tags
[22:09:39] <duckgoose> wheres the IP input
[22:09:44] <duckgoose> >_______>
[22:11:38] <RRR2> IP input?
[22:12:03] <duckgoose> there probably isn't such a thing
[22:12:56] <tw2113> yeah, still just the range input at the moment
[22:13:21] <tw2113> even in nightly updated
[22:15:09] <RRR2> What do you mean with IP input
[22:15:39] <RRR2> http://jsfiddle.net/XsTCr/1/
[22:15:42] <RRR2> Clearer
[22:17:26] <RRR2> Dat Chrome's Color picker
[22:18:11] <RRR2> Opera also supports them
[22:18:33] <tw2113> opera has a long history of good forms support if i recall
[22:18:49] <RRR2> Opera was the first to support them
[22:18:54] <RRR2> Most of them
[22:19:17] <RRR2> firefox maybe doesn't care or something
[22:19:35] <tw2113> it may not be an immediate priority
[22:19:47] <tw2113> you'd have to ask them
[22:19:50] <duckgoose> ie10 doesn't support any of them
[22:19:56] <RRR2> LOL
[22:20:06] <RRR2> well, if firefox doesn't supports it..
[22:20:16] <RRR2> I'd be mad if ie supported them
[22:20:31] <tw2113> the thing that gets me is that you sound like you think they never will
[22:20:44] <duckgoose> ie10 is suppose to be an html5 milestone
[22:20:47] <duckgoose> I guess not
[22:20:50] <tw2113> i'd personally prefer the form elements before electrolosis
[22:21:13] <tw2113> i don't care all that much for sandboxed tabs
[22:21:14] <RRR2> Well
[22:21:38] <RRR2> Someone requested that they added HTML5 support on Firefox 4
[22:21:42] <RRR2> on forms
[22:22:43] <duckgoose> does firefox need  electrolysis at all
[22:23:03] <tw2113> some people think so
[22:23:11] <RRR2> How firefox relates electrolysis or something
[22:23:20] <duckgoose> it's the only browser left that uses one process :P
[22:23:33] <chxane> does anyone know where I can find help specific to the jquery chosen library?
[22:23:39] <RRR2> I'm glad that happens
[22:23:55] <tw2113> huh chxane ?
[22:24:09] <chxane> I am having an issue of dynamically loading options from mongodb via sailsjs and jquery chosen being disabled after document load for some reason
[22:24:14] <RRR2> I can always can count with firefox working with low mem resources
[22:24:28] <RRR2> Chrome doesn't do that...
[22:24:29] <duckgoose> for now
[22:24:39] <duckgoose> when they have it load a new process for each webpage...
[22:24:41] <chxane> I mean jquery chosen plugin
[22:24:43] <chxane> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[22:24:47] <duckgoose> and then have to load the reosurces for each of those processes
[22:25:06] <RRR2> then I'm screwed
[22:25:09] <chxane> guess I could ask on the wiki hmm
[22:25:26] <RRR2> I really hope they don't do that anytime soon
[22:25:45] <tw2113> it's shelved at the moment
[22:26:06] <duckgoose> chxane maybe this will help you http://api.jquery.com/category/deprecated/
[22:26:33] <RRR2> I kinda hate chrome's process span
[22:27:09] <chxane> duckgoose, thanks but I am stuck with using that specific chosen plugin. The designer on this job I am on is using a template he bought so I have to debug this other guy's code while building in new functionality
[22:27:13] <chxane> it is crazy
[22:27:40] <duckgoose> I have chrome open now, one web page.... 8 processes
[22:27:56] <RRR2> ridiculous
[22:28:05] <RRR2> unless you have 7 plugins or something
[22:28:29] <duckgoose> maybe...
[22:28:38] <duckgoose> at least one is this irc client B]
[22:28:39] <superfred> I'm trying to have jQuery do a getJSON().  The results are returned but the callback function is not executed.  Firebug says I'm getting a 200 OK.  The JSON file is a simple text file that just has { '0':'apple', '1':'banana' }    ...  any thoughts?
[22:29:21] <duckgoose> is it local json?
[22:29:27] <superfred> yeah
[22:29:37] <superfred> same folder as the jquery and js file doing the calling
[22:29:52] <doug65536> superfred: on file:/// url?
[22:30:14] <superfred> no:    http://localhost/demo/file.json
[22:30:17] <doug65536> superfred: or an actual webserver
[22:30:21] <doug65536> ok
[22:30:28] <superfred> apache
[22:31:03] <doug65536> superfred: is it red in the firebug console?
[22:31:08] <RRR2> try to do AJAX on it first, maybe
[22:31:09] <superfred> nope
[22:31:15] <superfred> did... same thing
[22:31:17] <doug65536> superfred: show code please
[22:31:21] <superfred> it's not making it into the syntax
[22:31:42] <RRR2> then try Raw XMLHttpRequest lol
[22:32:33] <duckgoose> http://pastebin.com
[22:32:44] <superfred> http://pastie.org/8226126
[22:32:49] <huafu_> Simple quotes instead of doubles in the JSON?
[22:32:50] <RRR2> <pastebin
[22:32:52] <superfred> that's the getJSON
[22:32:53] <RRR2> lolz
[22:33:08] <superfred> huafu_: I did change the singles to doubles.  I still get the same thing
[22:33:30] <huafu_> Just trying ;-)
[22:33:44] <RRR2> huafu_: Why not simple quotes..?
[22:34:00] <RRR2> huafu_: is that incorrect JSON?
[22:34:00] <superfred> huafu_:    :-)  yep.  I thought of the same thing.  Actually, I do have it validating on jsonlint.com
[22:34:19] <duckgoose> perhaps the server isn't returning a proper content-type
[22:34:26] <huafu_> I'm not sure but I remember I had some problems with some parsers not liking the single ones in some of my confit files, JSON format of course
[22:34:29] <RRR2> content-type is meaningless
[22:34:33] <doug65536> superfred: can you show the json?
[22:34:41] <RRR2> he already did
[22:34:52] <superfred> oh wait... I got it!
[22:34:56] <doug65536> RRR2: where
[22:35:10] <superfred> It *was* the single -> double quotes... but I also had a semi-colon at the very end.  whoops!
[22:35:11] <RRR2> { '0':'apple', '1':'banana' }
[22:35:13] <superfred> thanks guys :)
[22:35:21] <RRR2> lol
[22:35:30] <huafu_> Haha
[22:35:31] <superfred> so two issues in one
[22:35:41] <superfred> what a dork! :)
[22:35:46] <huafu_> Glad you found it
[22:36:30] <RRR2> Well if single quotes don't work on the parser I wouldn't use that parser
[22:36:40] <RRR2> Just saiyan
[22:36:44] <doug65536> RRR2: that parser is following the spec
[22:36:58] <RRR2> doug65536: Oh really?
[22:37:06] <superfred> huafu_: thanks :-)
[22:37:11] <RRR2> doug65536: So it's actually a must?
[22:37:22] <doug65536> RRR2: pretty sure " is required
[22:37:31] <doug65536> even though javascript could accept '
[22:37:48] <RRR2> I thought it was just JavaScript Object Notation...
[22:37:52] <duckgoose> I don't see why it would
[22:37:53] <RRR2> but okay..
[22:37:58] <duckgoose> "blah" == 'blah'
[22:37:58] <huafu_> Yeah RRR2 doubles are the spec I'm pretty sure
[22:38:05] <doug65536> RRR2: yes but it's not javascript - it's restricted for security and implementation simplicity reasons
[22:38:33] <huafu_> Yeah three is a difference between JavaScript code and JSON format even if at the end the JSON format compiles into JavaScript
[22:39:01] <superfred> in the data, is there something I need to do with it to be able to access it by the numerical indexes?
[22:39:02] <huafu_> -compiles +pares
[22:39:36] <huafu_> You have to pretty much re-index it yourself with some js
[22:40:01] <RRR2> You can just use an array
[22:40:10] <huafu_> Yeah but I
[22:40:13] <doug65536> RRR2: if you want jquery to just throw it at javascript engine without strict parse, use jsonp
[22:40:30] <RRR2> jsonp?
[22:40:50] <doug65536> RRR2: it's a hack that lets you do cross-site ajax request of json
[22:40:52] <huafu_> doug65536: It won't make it into an array
[22:41:11] <RRR2> JSON.parse?
[22:41:31] <doug65536> RRR2: no, read $.ajax documentation. jsonp is a dataType
[22:41:41] <RRR2> Oh
[22:41:58] <huafu_> Nope you don't need jsonp if you're not doing crossdomain
[22:42:19] <RRR2> So jQuery actually parses JSON and doesn't uses the JSON object?
[22:42:21] <doug65536> huafu_: you do if you don't run the server serving the json
[22:43:03] <huafu_> Yeah, so crossdomain
[22:43:41] <huafu_> If you want it as an array you need to either put it in another format in your server file like this ["apple", "banana"]
[22:43:42] <doug65536> RRR2: it doesn't blindly throw it at eval or something trivial as one might imagine
[22:44:14] <RRR2> doug65536: Lol
[22:44:21] <RRR2> doug65536: Of course not.
[22:44:29] <huafu_> Or to parse the answer and reformat it the way you want, like parsing the JSON and then creating this array from it
[22:44:55] <doug65536> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing ?
[22:45:16] <RRR2> Aren't arrays JSON too?
[22:45:26] <superfred> is there a way to reference "this" one parent up from the callback function of getJSON?
[22:45:30] <ravenzz> huafu_ $.parseJSON(data).makeArray();
[22:45:33] <huafu_> But I'm not sure RRR2's problem here is the crossdomain problem..
[22:45:49] <doug65536> huafu_: you do realize that without the server response saying it is ok, the browser will cancel the ajax request
[22:45:54] <huafu_> RRR2: Yes you can put arrays in JSON
[22:46:11] <tw2113> isn't it superfred with the cross domain issue?
[22:46:31] <huafu_> No, he said he's running on localhost with apache so it is running on a server and the resource is on the same server
[22:46:37] <ravenzz> $.makeArray($.parseJSON(data)) actually
[22:46:38] <superfred> tw2113: nope :)
[22:46:46] <tw2113> someone has issues!
[22:46:50] <doug65536> tw2113: superfred found the bug - incorrectly formatted json
[22:46:51] <tw2113> and it's probably me!
[22:46:59] <RRR2> I just use JSON.parse, and the problem is solved
[22:47:07] <huafu_> Haha sorry I thought RRR2 was the JSON issue
[22:47:31] <superfred> lol....  so many people to help...
[22:47:37] <huafu_> Ah no I was right lol RRR2 issue is the array JSON
[22:47:38] * tw2113 goes back to downloading from youtube
[22:47:49] <doug65536> huafu_: try $('#some_div').load('http://google.com/')   let me know how that works out
[22:48:30] <huafu_> doug65536: Yeah I know I thought RRR2 problem was that he wanted to have some array in its JSON instead of object
[22:48:38] <doug65536> huafu_: oh ok
[22:48:43] <huafu_> Lol
[22:48:47] <doug65536> thought you were saying that cross-site ajax was ok
[22:48:56] <doug65536> lol
[22:49:15] <RRR2> JSON has nothing to do with cross domain, what you guys even arguing about
[22:49:21] <huafu_> It is ok if you can configure the server to send good headers or using jsonp ;-)
[22:49:37] <doug65536> huafu_: yes, that's what I was saying :)
[22:49:40] <huafu_> But yeah usually you can't change the server response so jsonp
[22:49:45] <huafu_> Lol
[22:49:59] <huafu_> doug65536: I'm lost of who asked what lol
[22:50:41] <doug65536> huafu_: missing json response let me to believe it was cross-origin problem - and firebug sucks at letting you know that. that's why I was going there
[22:50:47] <doug65536> led*
[22:51:11] <RRR2> What, why would the content-type even matter? I thought the content-type can be image/png but if the response is JSON it can be parsed
[22:51:32] <doug65536> huafu_: but he would have gotten an 'error' callback in that case anyway though...
[22:51:48] <doug65536> huafu_: I assumed he over-minimized the repro
[22:52:09] <huafu_> Hehe
[22:52:36] <huafu_> I have to go anyway, so I'll not make anymore confusions lol
[22:53:03] <RRR2> Besides, can anyone link me to anywhere that says it must be " instead of '
[22:53:22] <doug65536> RRR2:  http://www.json.org/
[22:53:37] <doug65536> notice string state machine
[22:53:45] <doug65536> only doublequote
[22:55:09] <RRR2> agh
[22:55:50] <RRR2> But it gives references to C and Java String
[22:56:03] <RRR2> they don't allow single quotes
[22:56:13] <doug65536> RRR2: it mentions similarity to those language's syntaxes, that's all
[22:56:15] <RRR2> for strings..
[22:56:24] <doug65536> ...but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages,...
[22:57:18] <doug65536> it mentions perl too... does it implement their crazy string syntax? no.
[22:58:56] <RRR2> in the RFC it simply says quotation marks
[22:59:17] <doug65536> RRR2: still trying to prove ' is legal?
[22:59:27] <RRR2> why not
[22:59:35] <doug65536> because it is illegal
[23:00:11] <doug65536> I'll find it in rfc...
[23:00:37] <doug65536> quotation-mark = %x22      ; "
[23:00:51] <doug65536> page 4
[23:01:18] <doug65536> 0x22 == 34 == "
[23:01:35] <doug65536> string = quotation-mark *char quotation-mark
[23:05:41] <doug65536> json is not javascript. json became successful because javascript has clean, simple, elegant object literal syntax, so json is insipred by javascript syntax.
[23:06:36] <doug65536> json is a highly restricted subset of javascript
[23:06:43] <doug65536> json is valid javascript though
[23:22:03] <gordian> doug65536
[23:22:09] <doug65536> gordian: yes
[23:22:30] <doug65536> I was busy yesterday. still having trouble with animation thing?
[23:23:18] <doug65536> gordian: here's is highly simplified implementation of what you're doing http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/AnvM4/
[23:23:58] <gordian> here's the final version: http://jsfiddle.net/WVu73/
[23:24:25] <gordian> "infinite" loop with nav bullet functionality
[23:24:40] <gordian> took a while but got there in the end
[23:24:57] <gordian> took a lot of stackoverflow studying though
[23:25:03] <doug65536> gordian: works well
[23:25:13] <gordian> thanks, i think so
[23:25:20] <gordian> let me know if you can break it
[23:25:34] <doug65536> I',m already trying to :)
[23:26:10] <doug65536> gordian: would be nice if the buttons didn't disable
[23:26:30] <gordian> i know, but that's not my decision ;-)
[23:26:33] <doug65536> gordian: why does it disable them? screws up?
[23:26:54] <sarath_> hi
[23:26:56] <gordian> i'm working through a textbook
[23:27:03] <doug65536> gordian: oh ok
[23:27:06] <sarath_> good
[23:27:07] <gordian> (this isn't homework though)
[23:27:18] <gordian> my classroom days are long gone :P
[23:27:25] <sarath_> very good
[23:27:38] <doug65536> gordian: homework is fine. if people cheat, the teacher probably will detect that the code isn't the student's :)
[23:28:00] <gordian> definitely true
[23:28:09] <gordian> i actually do CSS homework for a few people
[23:28:20] <gordian> keeps my mind limber
[23:28:47] <doug65536> gordian: like a student giving this code as a hand-in, as if a basic jquery student would write it: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/peC3r/ http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4vFZq/
[23:29:33] <gordian> woah
[23:29:34] <gordian> nice
[23:30:06] <doug65536> gordian: thanks :)
[23:30:10] <gordian> yeah i imagine those would definitely stand out in an intro class
[23:33:24] <gordian> whew
[23:37:40] <doug65536> Praise, guess what? connection reset by peer :P
[23:42:29] <gordian> lol
[23:45:03] <gordian> my next project will be to allow for variable width images in flexslider
