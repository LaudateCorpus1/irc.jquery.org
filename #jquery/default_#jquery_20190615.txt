[14:32:58] <ekiro> Hi everyone. Hope someone can help me with an issue. I have the user click on text which then turns it into a input with a autocomplete drop down, and when the user selects a new item from the drop down the text is replaced with it. But then when he attempts to do the same action again it does not work. Clicking on the text does nothing. Here is my code: https://bpaste.net/show/5eaa486d9981  (it's pretty short)
[14:41:26] <shoky> ekiro: it doesn't work again because you have replaced the element on which you've attached the click handler
[14:42:15] <shoky> ekiro: you'd either have to re-bind the click handler when re-creating it, or a simpler solution usually is to use event delegation, you can read about it in .on() docs
[14:42:56] <shoky> ekiro: basically switch  `$('#uploaderFile' + id).find('.file-show-title').click(function() {`   with:   $('#uploaderFile' + id).on('click', '.file-show-title', function() {
[14:43:27] <shoky> that way you bind the event handler on the container element, which is not being replaced
[15:17:04] <ekiro> thx much shoky !
