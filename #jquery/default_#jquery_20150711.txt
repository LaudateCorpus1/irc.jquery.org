[01:26:56] <iamse7en> how could I take my jquery datepicker and turn each day into a url? basically just need to append ?date='date' to each day in the datepicker.
[01:27:56] <iamse7en> http://jsfiddle.net/k2faz58e/1/ - is this the best solution?
[01:33:36] <Narhir> maybe someone could help me out with this issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31355134/flipclock-multiple-instances-counting-to-specific-date-in-data-countdown
[01:58:15] <morfin> you could just $.loadScript you know
[02:04:53] <Narhir> I dont know... :)
[02:07:18] <iamse7en> if I want to change a set of <a href>s to have an a class of "inactive", do I need to removeClass('active') then addClass('inactive') or can just do the second part?
[02:07:39] <iamse7en> or just the first
[02:32:27] <morfin> is that jQuery who set header X-Requested-With to XMLHttpRequest?
[02:42:45] <Sagar> is there a way to save image data in a jquery/javascript variable like php? $imgdata = file_get_contents("url-to-image.com/file.png");
[03:04:56] <FarLight> hello
[04:05:55] <sash_> .stop() should be default in all jquery animations -.-
[06:48:28] <ashgotti> Morning everyone. I need a bit of help. I think I'm missing something simple. I have Field A and Field B. Field B can't be > than Field A. If Field B is > than Field A, the user is prompted. The problem is that after the prompt, if I delete the contents of Field B and enter a new number, the validation doesn't run again
[06:51:52] <ashgotti> This is my simple code http://pastebin.com/Wnx3DYRg
[06:57:16] <nodist> are there any other errors in the console after this occurs?
[06:58:17] <ashgotti> nodist: Me? Nope, no errors
[07:04:33] <nodist> ashgotti http://jsfiddle.net/jegzs48t/ try this?
[07:18:26] <peterson_> when requesting json data via an ajax get, how can i then pump that response into a template in the page?
[07:20:55] <peterson_> the data returned isn't html
[07:22:12] <nodist> append it to a tag?
[07:22:32] <nodist> or do you mean format the data to html?
[07:35:30] <likecolacola> does it makes sense  to use jQuery v1.11.3 instead of v2.1.4 so that old browsers encounter no problems :P?
[07:56:40] <ashgotti> I'm having issues with jquery and ajax. After ajaxComplete, my jquery no longer fires. Like if I had a button that is supposed to populate a field, it doesn't work.
[08:30:19] <Crucials> ashgotti do you have a code sample?
[08:30:56] <ashgotti> Crucials: it's a bit tough to do a snippet because I'm using it in conjunction with Drupal.
[08:31:18] <ashgotti> I think it's an overall issue with my understanding of jquery and ajax
[08:31:40] <Crucials> its easiest to see what is wrong by seeing like a simplified version of the problem in a fiddle
[08:31:44] <ashgotti> After ajax fires on the page, do I need to do anything special?
[08:31:46] <ashgotti> Ok let me try
[08:32:04] <Crucials> if you can recreate it in a clean environment and not get that bug, probably means the problem is somewhere else
[08:32:26] <ashgotti> Understood. I don't think it's a bug, no errors in console but my own lack of understanding of ajax and jquery
[08:41:04] <donguston> what problem are you haivng  ashka
[08:41:10] <donguston> wait hes gone
[08:41:19] <donguston> what a nerd lmao
[09:44:54] <Horacsio> hi there
[09:48:31] <arthurvr> hey Horacsio

[09:55:31] <Horacsio> $(" .psc_anfora" ).click(function () {…} I need to add .bolder3 to it
[09:59:38] <Uhkis> ?api addclass
[09:59:38] <b-ot> Uhkis: .addClass(): Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[10:04:48] <Horacsio> so I should add same class to both buttons and the use it with the click function, correct?
[11:51:40] <Gorge> Hello, is correct to use $().click() inside another $().click() event?

[18:20:55] <asmonaut> Hi. Im loading some external html code file (child) into a div. I have a function that modifies the behavior of elements in the code loaded into that div. 1) the <script> tag in the child seems invisible - not even an 'alert' will work. 2) switch to plan B, loading the stylizing function at the <head> of parent page. It DOES load, but now the elements of child page don't respond at all to the
[18:20:55] <asmonaut> function. What do I do? help! :D
[23:02:06] <h0m1x> I have a set of custom field which will be loaded after I check a specific category,  I am trying to add border to the element which will be added after I check the category, unfortunately, it won't style it the first time I check the category, it seems the first time I check the category the element will not be loaded before the script is triggered. Any solution?
