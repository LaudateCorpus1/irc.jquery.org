[00:00:00] <z1haze2> nah it wasnt that, apprently you have to slideup the td and not the row. weird
[00:22:02] <flatster> hey guys, for json, should I NOT have information in the keyname?
[00:22:34] <flatster> for example, if I want to collect usernames, would it be wrong to put username as a key?
[00:55:29] <Whiskey> How can i by find the classname select the first tr in <tr><th class="MediaInfo" colspan="2">Sometext</th></tr>
[00:55:31] <Whiskey> ?
[01:09:48] <kegster> What's the best way to detect if an image (or any object really) is truly visible EVEN being sensitive enough to detect if it's behind a div or not-- so if i can't see any spec of it, then it's inviisble?
[01:11:57] <vinex08> hi, i got a lil bit problem with http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/   -- the effect doesnt work well on ios
[01:12:00] <vinex08> in ios    if ($window.scrollTop() >= distance) {   <-- this code is not working, the blue box stays fixed even tho windowtop hasnt reach the class c yet
[01:28:16] <Cork> kegster: there isn't a good way to do that
[01:28:41] <Cork> kegster: only option is to grab the dimensions of on the element and check those with the elements you think might cover it
[01:31:09] <kegster> Cork, meh
[01:31:09] <kegster> :P
[01:32:17] <Cork> kegster: there are new dom apis on the way that lets you get what parts of an element is visible
[01:32:37] <Cork> but i don't think it is even paste the rfc state yet
[01:34:13] <MalditoDev> Hi I needed to hide a drop down once a link was clicked so I wrote this little jquery and it works but the dropdown no longer works when you hover after the first time?
[01:34:13] <MalditoDev> http://oi59.tinypic.com/vzylh3.jpg
[01:34:27] <MalditoDev> Any help would be much appreciated
[01:36:38] <MalditoDev> and once you click the subnav once and it hides the drop down no longer works
[01:36:43] <vinex08> not sure if am muted or what ?
[01:36:51] <leftson> hey guys, is there a book on structuring json data?
[01:37:51] <leftson> firstly, should the key ever contain "data", like putting a username in key
[01:37:57] <leftson> or should it always be something generic, like id#
[01:38:07] <leftson> for users
[01:42:34] <rubyronin> can someone explain what I'm oing wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/ex1kyg15/5/
[01:49:56] <Cork> rubyronin: don't use event attributes
[01:50:10] <Cork> use ecvent listeners and things should work better
[01:51:22] <Cork> rubyronin: http://jsfiddle.net/ex1kyg15/7/
[01:53:00] <rubyronin> Cork: thanks!
[02:01:43] <rubyronin> Cork: I'm attempting submit data via form url without using thier website to grab the data they return
[02:01:52] <vinex08> hi Cork
[02:02:21] <Cork> rubyronin: uh...
[02:02:36] <rubyronin> Cork: ok poorly communicated
[02:02:44] <rubyronin> Cork: I'm trying to scrape data from a site
[02:02:49] <Cork> in js??
[02:02:57] <rubyronin> Cork: yes
[02:02:59] <Cork> why?
[02:03:18] <rubyronin> Cork: I want to aggregate the returned data to a dashboard, and the stupid site doesn't have a widget
[02:03:41] <Cork> rubyronin: you can't access there data cross domain unless they explicitly allow that
[02:04:02] <Cork> so make sure they have the cors header, or your work in wasted time
[02:04:09] <rubyronin> hmm...
[02:04:26] <Cork> if they DON'T have the header you have to proxy it over a domain you control
[02:04:56] <rubyronin> crossDomain: true,
[02:05:06] <Cork> on there side
[02:05:15] <Cork> you can't say "ya the domain accepts that i send data"
[02:05:20] <Cork> that would be pointless
[02:05:49] <vinex08> hiii
[02:07:55] <rubyronin> is crossDomain: true the cors header?
[02:08:02] <Cork> no
[02:08:23] <Cork> that just tells jquery to treat json calls to the same domain as cross domain
[02:08:28] <Cork> (meaning it tries to use jsonp)
[02:09:02] <Cork> rubyronin: like i said, if you in the client could say if the other end supports cors, it would be pointless
[02:09:16] <Cork> cause then it would just mean everyone says "yes" and it would be pointless
[02:09:38] <rubyronin> ?
[02:09:38] <Cork> rubyronin: cors headers is something the server sends in the http header for the request
[02:09:44] <vinex08> hi rubyronin
[02:09:56] <rubyronin> so how do I determine if cors is accepted?
[02:09:58] <rubyronin> vinex08: hi
[02:10:00] <Cork> if the browser doesn't see this header it won't give you the data
[02:10:08] <vinex08> oh so you guys see my chat messages :)
[02:10:21] <vinex08> i thought my irc is broken or something
[02:10:26] <Cork> rubyronin: the reason is that without this many sites would leak sensitive data
[02:10:57] <Cork> so browsers block it unless the server explicitly say "i can handle cross domain request without leaking data"
[02:11:12] <rubyronin> Cork: ok, what about if I use curl?
[02:11:34] <Cork> rubyronin: curl is run by you not by a person sending you a script :)
[02:12:03] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/  this doesnt work well in ios, it executes the command even before the 'class c' touches the top window.. help?
[02:12:05] <rubyronin> Cork: I plan to run my script in node
[02:12:35] <Cork> rubyronin: you should have said that before
[02:13:10] <rubyronin> Cork: oh, sorry
[02:13:14] <rubyronin> https://gist.github.com/RubyRonin/c26817fbe61744522a95
[02:13:24] <Cork> rubyronin: for node.js ya you shouldn't have this problem
[02:13:28] <rubyronin> so I got the address I need to submit the form from this source
[02:13:58] <Cork> rubyronin: to explain a bit more what i talked about, if you load a script in a website
[02:14:01] <rubyronin> Cork: the form is found on this page on the lower left side of the page "Property History"
[02:14:03] <rubyronin> http://www.phila.gov/li/Pages/default.aspx
[02:14:21] <Cork> this js fetches from any domain on the net, it would have access to your cookies store, so it would do it as your sessions
[02:14:34] <Cork> meaning it could access ex. your account info from facebook or similar
[02:14:38] <Cork> so browsers block that
[02:17:15] <rubyronin> Cork: this explains why when using the browser for http://services.phila.gov/ULRS311/Data/LIAddressKey/ it returns nothing
[02:17:23] <rubyronin> but when I access the same adress in curl I get a response
[02:19:04] * vinex08 ehemm
[02:20:46] <rubyronin> Cork: how do I duplicate the form request in curl? or better yet, nodejs request
[02:21:12] <Cork> rubyronin: => #node.js
[02:21:20] <Cork> off topic for this channel
[02:21:52] <rubyronin> Cork: I know but the folks in node.js ignored me
[02:25:40] * vinex08 ehemmmmmm!!!!
[02:26:25] <rubyronin> vinex08: whats your issue?
[02:29:02] <vinex08> http://jsfiddle.net/vinex08/uhm26em1/  this doesnt work well in ios, it executes the command even before the 'class c' touches the top window.. help?
[02:32:11] <rubyronin> vinex08: no ios experience over here
[02:32:23] <rubyronin> sorry I can't help
[02:33:23] <vinex08> no prob :)
[03:32:11] <hellyeah> someone kjnows c# here my question is kinda of related. I just try to pass variable to GetDate() function in vc# what is my mistake here https://jsfiddle.net/68e66xt5/1/

[05:12:35] <lenswipee> hi, anyone got an easy way to do a countdown timer for 5minutes down to 0, so it looks like 4 minutes, 59 seconds
[05:13:00] <robhol> define "easy way"? :p

[05:30:13] <Kartagis> has anyone managed to successfully post a video_embed_field url with ajax to a drupal website?
[05:38:13] <CC93829> Is it bad practice to assign php varible values to a javascript variable? EG, var myInt = "<php echo $myIntPHP; ?>"
[05:38:28] <CC93829> If so, could it be done else wise?
[05:38:44] <Kartagis> CC93829: can you get that value with javascript?
[05:39:28] <CC93829> It's sent from a controller, which is sent from the database, unless I use a Ajax call, I can't really get that value
[05:39:56] <Kartagis> use an ajax call
[05:40:28] <CC93829> Should I create a simple function which returns the id value, which I then pass to the ajax call?
[05:40:44] <CC93829> In general, is it bad to mix up PHP and JS?
[05:43:18] <Kartagis> server side and client side, I assume yes it's bad
[05:44:07] <CC93829> I see
[05:44:14] <CC93829> Thank you for the clear answers:)
[06:52:21] <hellyeah> hey
[06:52:37] <hellyeah> fallback is executed if success function is not carried out right
[07:05:40] <Cyberion> Hi, I dynamically create a table that contains many textboxes to which I attach a jquery keyboard but attaching the keyboard takes quite a while and even blocks the browser so that my busy gif stops moving
[07:06:06] <Cyberion> is there a way to prevent this?
[07:11:18] <Duikb00t> hey
[07:11:45] <Duikb00t> Is there a way I can get all images from a directory without naming them individually? images/*
[07:11:59] <Duikb00t> So I can just drop images in a folder and they are being added to a slider for examle.
[07:14:57] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t $imgs = glob('images/*');
[07:15:18] <Duikb00t> That's awesome!
[07:15:37] <Duikb00t> thanks!
[07:15:40] <Duikb00t> Didn't know that exists.
[07:16:31] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t Woops sorry for some reason I was thinking php >_< just realized this is a jquery channel
[07:16:41] <rollingWolf> Havent woken up since the weekend yet ;)
[07:16:41] <Duikb00t> Doesn't matter
[07:16:44] <Duikb00t> I can fetch them
[07:16:49] <Duikb00t> with glob
[07:17:06] <rollingWolf> Duikb00t :)
[08:07:09] <phpcoder> hello
[08:08:04] <taplar> yo
[08:08:29] <phpcoder> i have to use chosen() .... i have this global.js file that i include in each file how should i avoid throwing an exception if th element where i did .chosen() does no exists
[08:10:38] <taplar> you could check the length of your selector first and only do chosen() if it's > 0
[08:12:00] <phpcoder> taplar, ok! thanks
[08:27:56] <CC93829> Is there any recommended amount of Ajax calls to use on a page? Max recommended that is? Don't over ... amount of calls.
[08:30:01] <robhol> CC93829: no more than you need, pretty much
[08:35:24] <CC93829> thank you robhol
[08:40:34] <hellyeah> hey what am i doing wrong here it returned undefined? https://jsfiddle.net/qcoeayq4/
[09:06:33] <VectorX> how do i load jquery in the header so that $ can be used instead of jQuery throught the document
[09:07:19] <Kartagis> $ = function(jQuery) iirc
[09:07:42] <taplar> if your not in no conflict mode, $ and jQuery can be used interchangably through out the app.  you logic just has to proceed the import
[09:07:42] <VectorX> so  var $ = function(jQuery);
[09:11:06] <Narhir> Hey guys.
[09:14:56] <Narhir> I'm trying to hide fieldset if div that is inside this fieldset have display:none
[09:14:57] <Narhir> https://jsfiddle.net/u9v941rs/
[09:15:11] <Narhir> as inline style
[09:16:32] <taplar> looks like you trying to remove it, not hide it
[09:18:14] <Narhir> well either way I want to get rid of the fieldset if one of its divs have inline style of display:none :/
[09:18:31] <Kartagis> Narhir: hey
[09:18:40] <Narhir> hey Kartagis :)
[09:18:40] <taplar> any div or just the top level div?
[09:18:52] <Narhir> hmm
[09:18:56] <Kartagis> have you ever managed to successfully post a video_embed_field url with ajax to a drupal website?
[09:18:58] <Narhir> not sure what would work
[09:19:29] <Narhir> hmm not sure Kartagis how should that work ?
[09:19:42] <manners13> hey guys
[09:19:47] <Narhir> like you post a link to a video and it is instantly added ? like facebook timeline kind of thing?
[09:19:53] <hellyeah> Nahir do you want to hide field on page?_
[09:20:02] <Narhir> I want to hide fieldset
[09:20:20] <Kartagis> Narhir: you know what video_embed_field is, right?
[09:20:21] <Narhir> if all of its top level divs have display:none
[09:20:48] <Narhir> yeah
[09:21:09] <Narhir> you want it to happen after adding a link ?
[09:21:18] <manners13> please someone tell me im being completely stupid here
[09:21:50] <manners13> im trying to upload a file and post some data to another page using jquery and ajax
[09:21:54] <Narhir> But I have never wrote a module or form hook for video_embed_field
[09:21:57] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/60vnswu6/
[09:22:11] <hellyeah> taplar: why it returned undefined i define data propery there https://jsfiddle.net/qcoeayq4/
[09:22:22] <manners13> why are my results getting posted back to the original page instead of upload2.php
[09:23:05] <manners13> now im just testing at the moment but never really used jquery for much before
[09:23:16] <Jakey2>  does anyone know why my data-theme is not working correctly when i put in the different letters nothing changes
[09:23:26] <Jakey2> http://paste.ubuntu.com/12763114/
[09:25:23] <taplar> Narhir: possibly something like this https://jsfiddle.net/u9v941rs/2/
[09:25:50] <Kartagis> Narhir: I want to add a video link to vef field
[09:26:01] <Kartagis> but no success so far
[09:26:41] <manners13> can anyone point me in the right direction of what im doing wrong
[09:26:47] <Narhir> hmm
[09:26:57] <taplar> hellyeah: not sure.  where are you getting the undefined error at?
[09:26:58] <Narhir> not sure if I know what your trying to do
[09:27:07] <manners13> me?
[09:27:12] <hellyeah> in succes function
[09:27:17] <Narhir> but you could create new empty text field with access = false
[09:27:23] <Narhir> than copy the value of the link into that field
[09:27:28] <manners13> oh not me lol :)
[09:27:28] <taplar> hellyeah: try alerting just on response
[09:27:44] <hellyeah> response give all html code to me
[09:28:00] <taplar> ok, so it's a string, not an object
[09:28:00] <taplar> that's your 'data'
[09:28:02] <hellyeah> i just need to get the value of url that my function in backend return
[09:28:10] <Narhir> taplar I think it almost works
[09:28:39] <hellyeah> so response.data i cannot get this
[09:28:46] <taplar> does not exist
[09:29:00] <taplar> the response is the data
[09:29:11] <hellyeah> hunmm
[09:29:18] <hellyeah> this visual studio is stupid
[09:29:32] <hellyeah> this intellisense shit shows me that thing
[09:29:48] <hellyeah> shows
[09:30:32] <hellyeah> taplar: do i need to evoke url in success function?
[09:30:45] <taplar> i have no idea what your trying to accomplish
[09:31:24] <Narhir> taplar actualy..
[09:31:25] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:31:26] <Narhir> uh he left?
[09:31:33] <taplar> hmm?
[09:31:36] <hellyeah> i just try to pass a parameter to function GetDate
[09:31:42] <hellyeah> GetDate works in backend
[09:31:43] <Narhir> ah here your.. well: https://jsfiddle.net/u9v941rs/3/
[09:31:55] <Narhir> there is also one more div between..
[09:32:02] <hellyeah> i just want to call url with ajax and function with parametersd
[09:32:10] <taplar> hellyeah: your telling it the data type is text, but your giving it an object
[09:32:14] <taplar> you have to stringify it
[09:32:17] <Narhir> and the other thing is that the "display:none;" is added dynamicly with jquery and I wonder if that would work ?
[09:32:28] <hellyeah> ah
[09:32:35] <hellyeah> thats an improvemrent
[09:32:44] <hellyeah> okey stringify
[09:32:58] <hellyeah> taplar: if i wrote datatype:json it will work?
[09:33:09] <taplar> Narhir: the selector is doing '> div' so it only matches against immediately nested elements
[09:33:21] <Narhir> so..
[09:33:22] <taplar> if you want it to match more deeply, that'll need to be removed
[09:33:25] <Narhir> > div > div ? would work
[09:33:43] <taplar> sure, would search two levels deep only
[09:33:44] <Narhir> I think it does
[09:34:52] <taplar> hellyeah: dataType: 'json' i believe should handle the object for you, but it also expects a json object to be returned
[09:35:03] <taplar> iirc
[09:36:16] <taplar> brb
[09:37:03] <Narhir> taplar_brb: it seem to work in jsfiddle but not in the website
[09:42:23] <taplar> maybe they're not hidden yet?
[09:44:19] <Narhir> hmm
[09:44:24] <Narhir> can I send you the link to the website?
[09:44:28] <Narhir> I'm not sure why it is not working
[09:44:31] <Narhir> * on private chat
[09:44:39] <taplar> add some console logging to see
[09:45:12] <Narhir> I dont see errors releated to that
[09:45:21] <taplar> no, hold on...
[09:45:25] <Narhir> there are soem bootstrap errors
[09:45:53] <Kartagis> is it possible to find out in what format my web service needs data from me?
[09:46:17] <Kartagis> it's json, but I can't find the exact format
[09:46:20] <hellyeah> brb
[09:46:43] <taplar> Narhir: https://jsfiddle.net/u9v941rs/4/
[09:46:53] <taplar> so you can see what/if your selectors are matching anything
[09:47:28] <taplar> Kartagis: unless the service has an endpoint that details what is needed, then no
[09:48:46] <taplar> you'll need to see if they have any documentation on their endpoints
[09:49:19] <Narhir> I dont see anything in the log yet
[09:49:33] <taplar> nothing consoled?
[09:49:43] <Narhir> beside 2 errors that are not releated I think
[09:49:50] <Narhir> clearing cache
[09:49:57] <taplar> if you have errors, fix those first.  they can cascade and cause other crap to not work
[09:50:23] <taplar> crap is a technical term there, not derogatory, ;)
[09:50:47] <Kartagis> taplar: what if I can query it and see the format? but I can't create it even if I make the ajax call in that format
[09:51:34] <taplar> what do you mean query it and see the format?
[09:51:41] <Narhir> those errors I think are bootstrap releated
[09:51:48] <Narhir> but it seems like it is not logging anything..
[09:52:19] <taplar> Narhir: so either the errors are causing issue that are preventing the code to work, or the logic is not being invoked at all
[09:52:30] <taplar> or you have logging turned off in your console, :)
[09:54:11] <Narhir> hwh
[09:54:13] <Narhir> heh
[09:54:17] <Narhir> it is also a possiility
[09:56:23] <Narhir> it is also a bit of a drupal thing, at first I was getting "$ is not a function"
[09:56:32] <Narhir> so I replaced it with jQuery
[09:56:43] <taplar> ah
[09:57:32] <taplar> if you wanted you could surround your logic with function($){ /* ..... */}(jQuery);
[09:57:34] <Narhir> so it seems like it should be showing the errors
[09:57:51] <Narhir> I think thatm ight be it
[10:20:17] <Narhir> I cant make it work :/
[10:44:24] <Narhir> taplar: I have managed to make it work.. kind of: https://jsfiddle.net/u9v941rs/8/
[10:44:35] <Narhir> it hides the div but it also hide the label of the div
[10:45:14] <Narhir> it seems like it remove the "parent div" when the items are visible
[10:45:15] <Narhir> hmm
[10:45:31] <Narhir> I think it would be ok if it would remove the div if the parents are not visible
[10:49:05] <taplar> the filter should be only returning the parents that have no visible >div >div, but yes it is removing the entire parent
[10:52:34] <Narhir> It works in wrong way
[10:53:03] <Narhir> it should only remove the parent div if the div have all childrens of second from top level
[10:53:06] <Narhir> with display:none
[11:09:58] <eigentor> I want to raise a number, as long as it is within the range of an array of numbers I give http://pastebin.com/XAVTPL6y
[11:10:04] <eigentor> But somehow this does not work
[11:10:30] <eigentor> When I click #site-slogan, it does not raise chosen_year
[11:10:50] <eigentor> When I remove the if statement, it raises the number till infinity
[11:16:14] <eigentor> Ah ok. Somehow it always thinks the number is not in the array, when I check inside the click function.
[11:30:16] <andywww> how would one go about creating a plugin, say for the same of example called probe, that can be run like $.probe(variable) rather than $(element).probe() ?
[11:58:26] <jak2000> friends, how to clear a div? (the div have a large large html table)
[11:58:50] <taplar> eigentor: you left, but in case you read the logs.  $.inArray takes the array as the first parameter, not the second
[11:59:02] <daslicht> $(<<selector>>).html(""); ?

[11:59:10] <duch_kazatel> .empty()
[12:04:36] <jak2000> ok thanks
[12:11:53] <manners13> hey guys
[12:11:58] <manners13> can anyone point me in the right direction of what im doing wrong
[12:12:04] <manners13> why are my results getting posted back to the original page instead of upload2.php
[12:12:07] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/60vnswu6/
[12:13:32] <duch_kazatel> that alert might be to blame.
[12:14:04] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/60vnswu6/1/ try this instead
[12:19:54] <manners13> nope still getting the $_POST and $_FILES array back to the origin page
[12:20:07] <adavia> is anyone seeing the dropdown values collapsed in firefox https://jsfiddle.net/NzvKC/803/
[12:24:57] <motaka3> is there a tut on how tomake a wysiwyg from scratch using jquery?
[12:31:17] <manners13> well im stumped
[12:34:07] <krambiorix> hi, what am i doing wrong? http://pastebin.com/p1ahgQrc
[12:40:57] <shoky> krambiorix: myapp isn't global. it's a local variable inside the containing function(){..}
[12:41:18] <printForever> Uncaught TypeError: b.iLightBox is not a function
[12:45:52] <manners13> can anyone tell me why this keeps posting to the same page rather than url
[12:45:56] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/60vnswu6/
[12:49:28] <BillCriswell> manners13: I'm not sure I'm following.
[12:50:29] <BillCriswell> What are you expecting to happen here?
[12:51:23] <printForever> my whole jQ system broke down...
[12:52:48] <manners13> i want to be able to access the $_FILES and the $_POST array in uploads2.php
[12:53:16] <printForever> I want to be able to make my $_website work with jQUery
[12:53:38] <manners13> at the moment those 2 arrays are available on the page you actually upload the file but i need to process the results from the 2 arrays on uploads2.php
[12:54:02] <printForever> at the moment my 1 website is not processing any query by the iLightBox script
[12:55:17] <manners13> i thought by setting the url it should post the results over to that page there for i could process it adding the name etc to the database for later use
[12:55:31] <krambiorix> shoky, so what can i do ? i made it a global one but doesn't change anything
[13:03:46] <taplar> krambiorix: what do u have now?
[13:05:26] <krambiorix> taplar, http://pastebin.com/xdFrhUXE
[13:06:24] <taplar> krambiorix: it looks like your using your 'myapp' as a namespace.  no need to put it in a document ready the way you have it now
[13:07:32] <krambiorix> taplar, that made it work!!
[13:07:34] <krambiorix> thanks!
[13:07:44] <taplar> you get why you don't need the document ready?
[13:08:21] <krambiorix> taplar, because the variable will be loaded automatically when the document is ready?
[13:08:59] <taplar> ok, so document ready delays the execution of the logic until the page is processed, so any elements the logic needs should exist by then
[13:09:11] <krambiorix> ooow ok
[13:09:12] <taplar> but your namespace is not dependent on any page elements existing upon creation
[13:09:19] <krambiorix> aha
[13:09:31] <taplar> even if some of the functions it contains do, if you don't call those functions until the document is ready you'll be fine
[13:09:57] <krambiorix> taplar, ok thanks a lot!
[13:10:02] <taplar> yup
[13:12:16] <lordjancso> hi all
[13:12:28] <lordjancso> could you advice for me a good infinite scroller?
[13:12:47] <lordjancso> i have images and i would like to fetch them on scroll
[13:13:08] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10477021   <--- i try:    $("#myScroll").empty();  but not empty the div, why?
[13:13:37] <taplar> myScroll is a class
[13:14:17] <jak2000> arggghhh yes
[13:14:54] <taplar> lol, after that statement i hope you'll change your alias to 'piratejak'
[13:15:03] <jak2000> :)
[13:15:55] <manners13> taplar dont suppose you could help you seem pretty clued up
[13:16:14] <taplar> heh, just depends on what it is
[13:16:24] <taplar> what'cha'got ?  no promises
[13:16:50] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/60vnswu6/
[13:17:13] <manners13> why arent the $_FILES and $_POST arrays being posted to uploads2.php
[13:17:25] <manners13> they get posted back to the origin page
[13:18:44] <manners13> just pmed you a convo i was having with BillCriswell
[13:20:36] <taplar> so you say it works on one php and not another?
[13:21:16] <manners13> it posts the result back to the original page which i dont want
[13:21:26] <manners13> i just want it posted to uploads2.php
[13:22:03] <taplar> what do you mean posted back to the original page?
[13:22:12] <arc_> don't you need to specify the url in the form tag
[13:22:27] <manners13> so i have a page called editcandidate with an upload file box
[13:22:44] <arc_> <form action="url">
[13:22:57] <taplar> arc_: not required if your doing something like ajax based off the form
[13:23:24] <taplar> if your doing a typical form, even then it's not required.  it will default to the url your on
[13:23:29] <manners13> the page refreshes after a upload and i can print the arrays which displays the results
[13:24:19] <manners13> what i need is those arrays to be posted to uploads2.php and not clear the $_POST array already on editcandidates.php
[13:24:30] <jak2000> taplar you are my Heroe in this day!
[13:24:47] <taplar> manners13: you'll have to provide those values to your second ajax call.
[13:25:00] <taplar> $_POST only contains the values passed in the http content body
[13:25:54] <taplar> there is no default historical variables in regards to that.  http is for the most part stateless
[13:25:55] <manners13> *** sorry im lost
[13:26:49] <manners13> i get to this page from another page which creates the $_POST array for editcandidates and input field are populated from the $_POST array
[13:27:09] <manners13> i then chose to upload a file to link with the candidate
[13:27:14] <taplar> yep, and once that page is rendered, $_POST is gone
[13:27:39] <taplar> if you want to preserve and reuse those values, you'll have to put them on your page where you can access them, possibly as hidden fields
[13:27:44] <manners13> ok
[13:28:00] <manners13> but after uploading a file it creates the $files
[13:28:07] <manners13> but after uploading a file it creates the $_FILES array
[13:28:21] <manners13> which i actually want on uploads2.php
[13:28:42] <manners13> shouldnt the function post to the url specified
[13:28:49] <taplar> yes
[13:28:53] <manners13> but its not
[13:29:10] <manners13> its posting them back to the editcandidates page
[13:29:43] <manners13> which in turn are then not available on the uploads2.php page and the page isnt even called
[13:29:49] <manners13> or not that i can see
[13:31:13] <taplar> for kicks try changing your binding to this and add that first line in it: https://jsfiddle.net/60vnswu6/2/
[13:31:18] <taplar> see if anything changes
[13:31:19] <manners13> i have a php script on upload2.php which puts the file name and path in a database so next time the editcandidate page is called with that specific ID it then allows the user to download linked files for the candidate based on the ID
[13:34:24] <manners13> nope still looks the same
[13:34:48] <manners13> i get this posted back to the editcandidate.php page
[13:34:50] <manners13> Array ( [id] => 12657 ) Array ( [image] => Array ( [name] => Client Contact Log.xlsx [type] => application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet [tmp_name] => /var/zpanel/temp/php5wWhAT [error] => 0 [size] => 209558 ) )
[13:35:29] <taplar> hmm, the ajax request should be going to that url in the parameters.  you should be able to look at your network tab, clear it, do the upload and see it go to that url.  if it's not, i'm not sure why, :(
[13:37:23] <manners13> nope the network tab calls editcandidate.php again
[13:37:31] <manners13> it then refreshes and starts again
[13:37:47] <taplar> dang, heh, yeah you got me stumped, :s
[13:39:01] <manners13> lol
[13:39:07] <manners13> im glad its not just me
[13:42:41] <manners13> hold on maybe its damn cookies giving me greif as i can see in jsfiddle it does call the page correctly
[13:45:51] <manners13> nope still the same how can some code work on one page but not on another
[13:46:30] <taplar> do you have any other event bindings on that form?
[13:51:28] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/921qguez/1/
[13:51:52] <manners13> thats all the <scripts> i run on that page
[13:53:07] <manners13> other evens i use is onblur(function)
[13:53:17] <manners13> evens*events
[13:55:21] <manners13> can you see that any of them should affect data form
[13:55:46] <taplar> not really
[13:56:02] <taplar> what action do you have on your form?
[13:58:47] <manners13> there is no action for the uploads form
[13:59:01] <taplar> what's the url of the page?
[13:59:01] <manners13> the page is made up of 2 forms
[13:59:12] <taplar> is it the editcandidate.php?
[13:59:20] <manners13> yes
[13:59:38] <taplar> ok, try this for me.  put an action on the form of action="about:blank"
[13:59:48] <manners13> i can show you if you want to do screen share
[14:00:10] <taplar> nah, i'm just grasping straws now, :)
[14:01:18] <manners13> lol that then opens the about:blank
[14:01:22] <taplar> :D
[14:01:25] <taplar> progress
[14:01:28] <taplar> alright
[14:01:29] <manners13> didnt look like it uploaded though
[14:01:44] <manners13> might have been so quick i missed it of course
[14:01:50] <taplar> put this immediately before your binding
[14:01:55] <taplar> console.log($("form#data").length);
[14:02:28] <manners13> sorry where
[14:02:36] <taplar> right before the $("form#data").submit(...
[14:04:38] <manners13> ok then what
[14:04:45] <taplar> what did it console?
[14:05:06] <taplar> you'll have to do whatever you normally do to navigate to that page
[14:05:08] <manners13> Navigated to about:blank
[14:05:16] <taplar> check your console
[14:05:19] <manners13> https://join.me/852-377-086
[14:05:25] <manners13> log in
[14:11:51] <taplar> :D
[14:11:56] <taplar> ok
[14:11:59] <manners13> wow thanks so much
[14:12:00] <taplar> so here's what was going on
[14:12:17] <taplar> your logic is in your header.  at the time that the browser parses that logic to process it, your body is not yet rendered
[14:12:37] <taplar> if you want to keep your logic in the header then you have to surround it with a document ready to delay it until the body is loaded
[14:12:40] <manners13> ahh ok so it was completely missing the form
[14:12:46] <taplar> yup
[14:12:57] <manners13> well thanks i would have never got that
[14:15:28] <taplar> btw, i missed a ';' at the end of that.  join me was being mean to me
[14:22:37] <xenaxon> hi. How can I set a jquery range-slider programmatically?
[14:24:48] <ul71m0> Hi i have input that i feed with data on click. I have 5 elements with 5 different emails, and i need to feed the data in input. And i made it to work with .val but that removes old  value and i need to add it next to previous
[14:26:57] <taplar> ul71m0: got a fiddle?
[14:27:01] <ul71m0> sec
[14:27:07] <printForever> any function I run on the page I get undefined
[14:27:17] <printForever> I checked if jQuery is there, it's there
[14:27:27] <printForever> I checked selectors, they are good as well
[14:27:35] <printForever> but instead of working it returns undefined
[14:27:38] <taplar> how did you check?
[14:27:42] <printForever> console
[14:27:53] <taplar> if its an ordering issue, the console will not tell you that
[14:27:58] <taplar> jquery has to be included first
[14:28:06] <printForever> how do I check the order?
[14:28:22] <taplar> the script include has to be before any script that uses $ or jQuery
[14:28:38] <printForever> ? before
[14:28:54] <printForever> oh, you mean jQuery should be before any of them
[14:28:57] <printForever> thats fine, it is
[14:30:32] <printForever> the problem was with wordpress
[14:33:59] <monk12> hey all, is there a nice way to remove a tag and just replace as if it wasnt there? like I want to replace a font tag with just the text inside of it: <p><span>blah</span> foo <font>foo</font> foo </p> becomes <p><span>blah</span> foo foo foo </p>
[14:35:06] <taplar> monk12: you could do a replaceWith giving the elements text()
[14:35:22] <monk12> cool. i think I may have another solution too unwrap()
[14:35:33] <xenaxon> hi. How can I set a jquery range-slider programmatically?
[14:35:53] <xenaxon> I want to set it and make it update in interface, as in trigger the slide event
[14:35:56] <xenaxon> can someone help me?
[14:40:47] <taplar> xenaxon: i'm not very familiar with it, but are you talking about this guy?  http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/range.html
[14:41:08] <xenaxon> taplar: that is exactly what i'm talking about
[14:41:15] <xenaxon> taplar: that's the guy
[14:41:23] <xenaxon> taplar: :))
[14:41:44] <NitroLiq> Hey guys, quick question. I'm prototyping a site (using Foundation) and the way it was wire-framed, there are a lot of pieces being moved around the page based on the various breakpoints so there a couple of approaches to solving the issues: 1) use jQuery to detach/append code blocks update the DOM and 2) Use Foundation's plethora of visibility classes to hide/show. From what I've learned,...
[14:41:46] <NitroLiq> ...too much DOM manipulation is going to be expensive. Using the visibility classes (which is what I'm currently doing) feels sloopy because I'm having to duplicate bits of markup to hide/show at different places and in different breakpoints. Is there a best approach to these types of situations?
[14:42:47] <xenaxon> taplar: I managed to change it in the interface using this command: jQuery('#slider').slider('values',1,2116);
[14:42:56] <xenaxon> taplar: but it won't trigger the slider event
[14:43:13] <xenaxon> taplar: and I need the event to be triggered, because it updates some things in the interface
[14:44:08] <xenaxon> I want to create a preset, so when the user changes it, the slider range is set and the slider's slide event is triggered so that another dependent element updates based on this one
[14:44:15] <taplar> checkout the docs, might have something about that: http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/
[14:44:41] <xenaxon> I checked but I can't figure it out! found something about 'refresh' method on stack overflow but that method is not present in current jquery-ui
[14:46:17] <ul71m0> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/2dffwew5/ so i want to add emails with ; after you click on next one
[14:46:33] <ul71m0> and not to remove old and put new
[14:47:39] <taplar> oh
[14:48:37] <xenaxon> taplar: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2833396/jquery-ui-slider-setting-programatically
[14:49:01] <xenaxon> taplar: one of the guys explained here how to update it, but I don't understand how to apply for range-slider
[14:49:13] <xenaxon> taplar: that one is for single-value slider
[14:49:49] <taplar> ul71m0: https://jsfiddle.net/2dffwew5/1/
[14:51:00] <taplar> the accepted answer has the range slider too
[14:51:02] <ul71m0> taplar: ty :)
[14:51:06] <ul71m0> taplar++
[14:51:12] <taplar> $("#slider").slider('values',0,50); // sets first handle (index 0) to 50
[14:51:29] <taplar> the second input is the handle, 0 for left, 1 for right it seems
[15:08:37] <Side_FX> I have a variable: $(this).attr("title");, I'm trying to get what I would guess from my JS knowledge, $(this).attr("innerHTML"); but I get an undefined result
[15:08:53] <taplar> prop()
[15:08:56] <taplar> or just html()
[15:09:13] <Side_FX> $(this).html() ?
[15:09:16] <taplar> yep
[15:09:21] <Side_FX> Thanks!
[15:09:39] <taplar> attr() is for attributes such as title.  innerHTML is a property of the dom element
[15:10:00] * Side_FX nods
[15:16:24] <testerbit> I'm using $('.tt-suggestion').first() to select the first in a series of DIV's with that class name, how can I traverse to get the value of a child <p class = "repo-name"> > a (text value)?
[15:19:09] <xenaxon> taplar: I knew that the 0 is for first handle and 1 for second handle
[15:19:27] <xenaxon> taplar: I just don't know how to trigger the slide event after I set the values
[15:19:56] <xenaxon> the slider does update in the interface, but it doesn't trigger the Slide Event that is triggered when you slide it normally.
[15:31:04] <taplar> ah
[15:31:15] <taplar> well, you could try $(selector).trigger('slide')
[15:44:55] <xenaxon> taplar: didn't work
[15:46:17] <ThePendulum> 'lo. Anyone experienced with the datatables plugin? I'm trying to get it to render data from JSON. I'm stuck without an error... http://stock.unknown.name/site/1
[15:46:43] <ThePendulum> I see the table has the right amount of header elements, but no header text
[15:46:56] <ThePendulum> same for the rows
[15:47:11] <ThePendulum> the right amount of columns and rows, but no data
[15:57:15] <ThePendulum> got it :D
[15:57:17] <Siphion> ThePendulum: columns = columns.map(function (e){ return {title: e.data}; })
[15:57:36] <Siphion> ThePendulum: oh ok :)
[15:57:51] <ThePendulum> Siphion: is there a difference between sTitle and title?
[15:58:18] <Siphion> don't know xD just checked the doc on how to fill datatable using a javascript object
[15:58:45] <Siphion> i think that you can directly set the json url to feed datatable
[15:58:51] <ThePendulum> I stumbled on sTitle literally 10 seconds before you replied
[15:58:53] <ThePendulum> title seems cleaner
[15:58:55] <ThePendulum> seems to do the same
[15:59:07] <ThePendulum> hmm well I don't want to do that
[15:59:13] <ThePendulum> actually, do I want to do that
[16:20:50] <Noob_> Z3R0 you still online?
[16:35:29] <Noob_> How can I run a count on a model function?
[16:35:35] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[16:36:22] <Noob_> I have a function in my model that I want to return the count on.
[16:36:37] <duch_kazatel> the count of what?
[16:36:50] <duch_kazatel> the number of times it has run?
[16:37:15] <Noob_> no.  the number of results.
[16:37:34] <duch_kazatel> no idea without seeing what sort of data you're dealing with :)
[16:38:37] <Noob_> http://kopy.io/aLjaa
[16:39:20] <duch_kazatel> i don't do PHP.
[16:39:25] <duch_kazatel> json encode it.
[16:39:44] <duch_kazatel> if it comes out as a JSON array, do .length on the returned data.
[16:39:45] <mooncup> what do you mean Noob_?
[16:39:48] <Noob_> my bad.  I thought I was in the laravel forum.  sorry
[16:39:51] <mooncup> I'm assuming that's laravel
[16:39:56] <duch_kazatel> hah
[16:40:22] <mooncup> also try $model->degrees_count->count()
[16:40:45] <mooncup> or maybe $model->degrees_count()->count()
[16:41:02] <duch_kazatel> lol maybe take it to #laravel or whatever it is? :)
[16:46:25] <NitroLiq> Anyone know if there's best practice for detecting MQ width and not re-firing constantly using something like onResize?
[16:46:56] <duch_kazatel> matchMedia, but that has limited support.
[16:48:21] <xenaxon> hi. How can I set a jquery range-slider programmatically and trigger the slide event on it.?
[16:48:27] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq are you just trying to not fire your handler constantly?
[16:48:47] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon which range slider are you using?
[16:48:55] <xenaxon> the one from the ui
[16:49:03] <xenaxon> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/range.html
[16:49:19] <NitroLiq> yeah but it still needs to fire off the DOM stuff
[16:49:29] <NitroLiq> I've got this: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EVvQKV
[16:49:31] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#option-values should work.
[16:49:38] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: I managed to set it, I can change the value in the slider/interface. but it doesn't trigger the SLIDE event
[16:49:56] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon hrm.  mind making a fiddle?
[16:49:59] <xenaxon> the event is triggered when you trigger it naturally
[16:50:18] <xenaxon> ik
[16:50:20] <xenaxon> ok
[16:50:20] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq so I'd maybe use something like a throttle or a debounce instead.
[16:57:30] <jfive> how's it going everyone
[16:57:47] <jfive> any advice on styling checkboxes? =/
[16:57:48] <duch_kazatel> yo.
[16:57:52] <duch_kazatel> give up.
[16:57:57] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:57:59] <jfive> duch_kazatel: good advice. :)
[16:58:35] <jfive> it blows my mind that we can't even so much as just change the background color of a checkbox
[16:59:01] <duch_kazatel> users have basic expectations.  if you want anything super fancy, go wild and invent it.
[16:59:05] <duch_kazatel> then come back to checkboxes.
[16:59:28] <duch_kazatel> I might hit up #css and see if they can't help you.
[16:59:43] <jfive> yes but what do expectations have to do with colors? ;)
[17:00:06] <duch_kazatel> a surprisingly large amount.
[17:00:17] <jfive> yeah, might just do that... my attempts with css have not faired well so far
[17:00:34] <jfive> i remember there used to be a lot of plugins that did this but they all seem to be outdated etc
[17:00:40] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[17:00:49] <duch_kazatel> because people are doing that kind of thing less and less.
[17:07:11] <NitroLiq> Never used throttle/debounce
[17:09:33] <duch_kazatel> what do you need to know?
[17:19:00] <NitroLiq> Well, actually, I may have figured out a way to do it with out it.
[17:19:02] <NitroLiq> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/EVvQKV
[17:19:16] <NitroLiq> Only accounts for one breakpoint though.
[17:19:57] <duch_kazatel> fyi that line could literally be $(window).resize(detailPgResponse);
[17:20:08] <NitroLiq> I'll have to read up on it T/D. I think I briefly read about it/saw a plugin over on Ben Alman's site
[17:20:10] <duch_kazatel> and i'd still use a throttle on top of this.
[17:20:32] <duch_kazatel> underscore has them as well - it'd really complement what you're doing here
[17:20:44] <duch_kazatel> also: avoid $() as much as possible.
[17:21:09] <duch_kazatel> var $window = $(window); then use $window inside the handler.
[17:21:33] <NitroLiq> yeah, this was the quickie version. I hadn't cleaned it up yet.
[17:21:38] <LindsayMac> I have an ajax query that sometimes returns json data but sometimes returns nothing if nothing is found. I thought that jQuery.ajax() was supposed to read a 'nothing' response as a 204 status where the request was successful but nothing was returned but instead I'm getting TypeError: jsonResp is null (where jsonResp is my response object)
[17:21:44] <NitroLiq> I still have to account for other breakpoints as well
[17:22:22] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac what does your empty response look like?  an empty string?  or an empty array/object?
[17:23:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  it appears to return nothing. Looking at the response headers it says Content-Length: 0
[17:24:48] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  should I return something in my query like return null or return false?
[17:25:12] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: I don't know why jquery-ui not working in my jsfiddle
[17:25:15] <duch_kazatel> is "empty" a valid response?
[17:25:18] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac
[17:25:19] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/slider/range.html
[17:25:29] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: just use console on this example
[17:25:32] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: not sure what you're asking
[17:25:34] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon ...
[17:25:53] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac is there a valid use case where the user could get an empty response?  or is that indicative of an error?
[17:26:11] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  no there is a valid use case for it to return no results
[17:26:21] <duch_kazatel> then you need to have your server return an error response code.
[17:26:27] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: if the person has never visited a company party, it would return nothing..
[17:26:41] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: that should be a 204 then
[17:26:43] <LindsayMac> right?
[17:26:51] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/
[17:26:53] <xenaxon> here you go
[17:27:20] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac i thought it wasn't a valid use case - you wouldn't want a 204 in that case.
[17:27:32] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon great!  where's your code?
[17:27:51] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/1/
[17:28:31] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon err, all the stuff about the event handler and stuff.  looks like it's missing.
[17:28:43] <xenaxon> ok sorry wait
[17:28:52] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/2/
[17:29:08] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  nope.. its likely going to happen often. If I return a 204 will $.ajax() still run the "complete" or "success" code
[17:29:10] <LindsayMac> ?
[17:29:13] <xenaxon> this is it
[17:29:38] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac back waaaaay up.   so it IS a valid case for you to return no results?
[17:29:50] <duch_kazatel> if "empty" is valid, return an empty json response - {} or []
[17:29:51] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: that's how I set/update it: http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/3/
[17:30:04] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: but it's not triggering event
[17:30:12] <duch_kazatel> where's the handler?
[17:30:13] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yes.. i'm sorry.. there were a lot of double negatives in our convo
[17:30:35] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  to clarify.. it is completely and total valid and normal to return no results when a user triggers a query
[17:30:46] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian okay, then yeah, return an empty result.
[17:31:04] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  how do you mean ? just do return '';
[17:31:12] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac {} or []
[17:31:15] <duch_kazatel> an empty json object.
[17:31:25] <duch_kazatel> depends on what your normal return data looks like though.
[17:31:49] <LindsayMac> So that's better than returning a 204?
[17:32:18] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating concepts :)
[17:32:28] <LindsayMac> lol ok
[17:32:40] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/4/
[17:32:40] <duch_kazatel> 204 means the user agent shouldn't do anything.
[17:32:48] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/rjx8zdbh/4/ simple trigger with alert
[17:32:57] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ahh ok
[17:33:46] <duch_kazatel> xenaxon so you want to know why the change handler in this case doesn't get fired?  easy - it was initialized with particular values.
[17:33:49] <duch_kazatel> nothing ever "changed"
[17:34:15] <xenaxon> I want to make it trigger when I change the values programmatically
[17:35:36] <duch_kazatel> you want the change event then.
[17:35:44] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rjx8zdbh/5/
[17:36:33] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel: so would it be normal to wrap my whole "success" function in an if(response){do all my response stuff }else{ display a nice message }
[17:36:52] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac use .done(), and basically.
[17:37:28] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  but I am getting an error on success, and doesnt done run after that?
[17:37:37] <duch_kazatel> err...
[17:37:43] <duch_kazatel> you should be using .done() and .fail()
[17:38:03] <LindsayMac> Oh wait.. nevermind. No errors not on response since i switched to return '[]'
[17:38:07] <noahmg123> how do I echo the result of a jsonp ajax request?
[17:38:16] <duch_kazatel> console.log(myData);
[17:38:21] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 within your .done() handler
[17:38:55] <xenaxon> duch_kazatel: i tried change event, but it doesn't do the job
[17:39:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rjx8zdbh/5/ xenaxon that works.
[17:39:17] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: can you explain more? I have gotten jsonCallback to work with an alert but all data passed through is undefined.
[17:39:26] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 show me what you have.
[17:39:37] <duch_kazatel> hard to know how to help if I don't know how you're stuck :)
[17:39:40] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: ok. Just a moment.
[17:49:44] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: here it is http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwLWRY
[17:53:10] <duch_kazatel> noahmg123 http://codepen.io/anon/pen/RWZMVd
[17:53:15] <duch_kazatel> use .done() instead.
[17:54:08] <duch_kazatel> also, for what it's worth, jsonp and json are not the same thing.
[17:55:34] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: I know. But I got that url from a jquery.com article so... that's a bit weird.
[17:55:39] <noahmg123> wierd*
[17:55:46] <duch_kazatel> yuck.
[17:56:00] <duch_kazatel> wait "jquery.com article"?
[17:56:01] <duch_kazatel> where?
[17:58:23] <noahmg123> duch_kazatel: https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/ I didn't use everything so maybe that was it.
[17:58:49] <duch_kazatel> interesting.  looks like it's working around an issue with yahoo maybe?  anyway - get the idea with .done()
[17:58:55] <duch_kazatel> bbiab
[18:00:33] <LindsayMac> I'm still not sure how to deal with an "empty" json response. Should I just wrap the whole "success" code in an if statement?
[18:12:00] <caraconan> Hi there. Any idea why I can't get a url via jquery ajax call? https://paste.debian.net/315585/ Thanks
[18:27:07] <lumidee> hi, how can i say: .closest( "section with class='x' " )?
[18:28:09] <arc_> .closest('section.x')
[18:28:52] <lumidee> thank you!
[18:55:10] <durwasa> I am new to jQuery its been couple of days I have started with jQuery ... I am trying to make a check button that when checked will make a text box appear where a user can enter the data
[18:55:24] <durwasa> Can anyone help me please? A naive try :: http://jsfiddle.net/durwasa/3hph4u4r/
[18:56:04] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[18:56:12] <duch_kazatel> this is trying to add an input?
[18:56:20] <duch_kazatel> just hide/show one instead.
[18:56:53] <duch_kazatel> also: you can't append an input to a button.
[18:57:03] <duch_kazatel> you also have an unclosed div :)
[18:59:12] <LindsayMac> durwasa: don't use a checkbox and just make a link that looks like a checkbox
[18:59:43] <zzaichik> durwasa: so basically, that shit's a mess.  http://jsfiddle.net/3hph4u4r/1/
[18:59:52] <duch_kazatel> or don't append an input because why would you do that?
[19:00:07] <duch_kazatel> zzaichik has the right idea.
[19:00:34] <LindsayMac> If anyone has a min.. i'm trying to get all of the images that are in the <ul class="suggestedThumbs"> via the specific parent of the link and I'm having a hard time http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/o38wdwqu/
[19:00:51] <LindsayMac> lol zzaichik
[19:03:53] <LindsayMac> it seems like .children() isn't working as I would have expected. I basically am getting the parent (or .closest() ) container and then all of the img children of that container
[19:04:00] <shoky_> LindsayMac  .children returns only direct children. you want .find
[19:04:03] <LindsayMac> I just need to move them from one container to another on a clik
[19:04:06] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  OHHHHHHH
[19:04:44] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  so .find( $parentTag +'ul li img');
[19:04:57] <shoky_> no,  just replace .children with .find
[19:05:28] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  woot
[19:06:53] <derekZero> Is it possible to .animate a flexbox given that the flexbox requires display: flex; and .animate requires display: none;?
[19:10:45] <duch_kazatel> i reject your premise derekZero http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3ya24p0v/
[19:11:42] <derekZero> duch_kazatel: noice
[19:11:53] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you meant by your statement ;)
[19:13:43] <derekZero> duch_kazatel: More of this kind of scenario: http://jsfiddle.net/u1mv8v7r/
[19:14:00] <derekZero> Trying to achieve a sliding fade in
[19:15:11] <derekZero> duch_kazatel: Woops... added an ID in JS without making it in html first. My bad.
[19:15:24] <duch_kazatel> also, I think you're confused.
[19:16:10] <derekZero> duch_kazatel: That I am confused is most certain.
[19:16:54] <duch_kazatel> so think about it.
[19:17:07] <duch_kazatel> you're already at opacity 1, right?
[19:17:38] <duch_kazatel> so you're animating to... the same value :)
[19:18:01] <duch_kazatel> i think you're looking more for something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1mv8v7r/1/

[21:01:26] <Renari> Is it possible to use an ajax requests success callback as another function rather than a prototype? e.g. success: myfunction(response),
[21:01:46] <Renari> Since this keeps passing undefined to my function and saying response is undefined.
[21:02:21] <Renari> But using a prototype works e.g. success: function(reponse) {}
[21:05:27] <ngharo> you want to pass your function in, what you're doing in your first example is passing in the return value of your function
[21:05:48] <ngharo> so you want to simple do - success: myfunction
[21:23:15] <delizin> Howdy all. I am having a little bit of difficulty using .load() to replace the content of a <tbody>. When my function activates it is retrieving the new <tbody> and putting it inside of the old one instead of replacing it. Any suggestions on the proper way to do this? http://dpaste.com/04YPMKH
[21:23:30] <Renari> ngharo: thanks
[21:24:00] <delizin> I do not want to .load() on the table itself because it has is using the jquery datatables addon, which would require me to reinitialize the entire table with each ajax call.
[21:27:07] <ngharo> delizin: you have two #district_table_body
[21:27:57] <delizin> ngharo: Sorry, I should have presented that more clearly. That is the result after my saveDistrict function runs. There is only one #district_table_body in my code
[21:29:56] <ngharo> oh i see
[21:31:19] <ngharo> It'd make sense to only replace the single row being updated
[21:34:15] <delizin> ngharo: While that would work in that specific case, there are a couple of functions that I have to handle server side then return an entirely new table body on that page.
[21:34:39] <delizin> I am wondering if I can delete the current tbody and append the new tbody in it's place.
[21:36:47] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/k80pdgus/ i suppose this should work

[21:38:22] <sialorrr> the apply button
[21:39:27] <delizin> ngharo: That works perfectly and reduces me reusing code :) Thank you very much
[21:39:51] <ngharo> sialorrr: it has a class that describes itself.  i guess i'd use that to find it
[21:40:28] <sialorrr> ngharo: do you know the name of it? or what I should search for (only the HTML shows up when I inspect element in firefox)
[21:42:10] <sialorrr> everything ive tried so far hasnt worked
