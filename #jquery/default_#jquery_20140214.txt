[00:30:51] <PatBateman> morning
[00:31:51] <Hilton> Morning.
[00:31:59] <omegahm> morning
[00:32:28] <Jattenalle> morning
[00:33:44] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone tell me how to stop my div's being sortable above my H3? If I move by divs up too far (within the foreach) they nudge the <h3> down. That needs to be fixed. http://pastie.org/8732555
[00:41:06] <Serdar> good morning
[00:41:28] <Serdar> okay mabye not that good, but I give my best :)
[00:44:24] <fabioportieri> hello.. i did some stuff that relies on background-size:xxpx yypx; ... problem is, how can i make it work on IE8 ? is there any polyfill that accepts px in background-size? thanks
[00:46:08] <fRAiLtY-> Hello, here's my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/xyAWR/3/ How to stop the "Jobs" h3 being moved in the list, drag one of the items up above it and it sorts, I don't want that and it's not in the list?
[00:46:53] <sacho_> you have multiple things with the id "list"
[00:47:26] <sacho_> http://jsfiddle.net/xyAWR/4/ there you go
[00:48:21] <sacho_> well that seems to making dragging them a PITA for some reason, but w/e
[00:48:56] <fRAiLtY-> Ah jesus why didn't I see that, ffs
[00:48:57] <fRAiLtY->  sorry
[00:49:31] <Hilton> I have part of a page which is loaded via $.ajax() and displayed in the success function with $(..).html(result).
[00:50:11] <Hilton> Part of that retreived HTML includes a <script> tag to load an extra JS file. In FF and Chrome, this works fine, but IE11 is having difficulty.
[00:50:54] <a_fejer> Hilton: maybe some Cross-Site Scripting security feature is active from IE11 ?
[00:51:00] <Hilton> The code will show up in the debugger (under "dynamic scripts" > "eval code", rather than it's file name)
[00:51:45] <Hilton> But when I try to call a function from that file (via an onclick attribute - <button onclick="printPage();">), IE tells me "Object expected"
[00:51:46] <fRAiLtY-> sacho_:  Am I right in thinking that by logging toArray on sortable I can store that array in the db so the "order" of the items is saved?
[00:52:34] <Serdar> I got a question about ajax: I get parsererror if I run this code http://jsfiddle.net/F9T65/
[00:52:51] <Serdar> the strange thing is, that it worked but I don't see what I did wrong
[00:54:27] <Hilton> Okay I think I found the problem, but now I'm even more confused. I had printPage() wrapped inside a "if (navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase().indexOf('firefox') > -1) {" so that I could make browser-specific versions of the print function (since my FF one checks for and uses a printing add-on plugin).
[00:54:47] <Hilton> So IE never saw it because it was hidden from IE. But now my confusion is -- with the check above ... how come it worked in Chrome?
[00:56:50] <sacho_> fRAiLtY-, no idea
[00:57:33] <sacho_> are you sure chrome's useragent doesn't include firefox?
[00:57:45] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[00:58:06] <Serdar> how can I get more information from ajax?
[00:58:48] <Hilton> sacho_: If I put other code within that if (navigator ...), like say an alert, it does not execute.
[00:59:08] <Serdar> I need to know why I get a parsererror
[00:59:30] <sacho_> ok, so where's your code?
[00:59:58] <sacho_> Serdar, use your browser's dev tools to inspect the response
[01:01:14] <Serdar> my code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/F9T65/ but I will try to get more information from IE then
[01:01:29] <Serdar> before I asked here I was not very successfull :(
[01:01:59] <sacho_> f12 network tab etc
[01:02:25] <sacho_> I don't use IE for dev so don't know off the top of my head where you'd look
[01:02:37] <sacho_> you should get comfortable with the dev tools though, debugging javascript without them is stone age
[01:03:58] <Serdar> I am 30 since last friday, so I am stone age too :D
[01:04:12] <Serdar> let me look what chrome says
[01:05:07] <Serdar> huh chrome does not own a debugger?!
[01:05:46] <sacho_> sure it does
[01:06:43] <Serdar> found it, it was not as clear as in IE.
[01:07:19] <Hilton> ctrl-shift-j... or right click an element and hit Inspect Element (same as all browsers), then go to the Sources tab (Debugger in IE and Firefox, Script in Firebug)
[01:11:22] <Serdar> hmm it is not possible to get step by step all options of the ajax call
[01:12:33] <pom_life> I've officially developed GOTY. > http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/DX3u6/4/ <
[01:13:59] <Serdar> It kinda looks that my php file is not called
[01:18:19] <Jattenalle> pom_life, too addictive! take that filth down before someone hurts themselves!
[01:18:26] * Jattenalle refreshes page and clicks it a few more times
[01:19:31] <pom_life> Jattenalle: What's that? I can't hear you because I addicted myself too hard
[01:20:04] <Jattenalle> "10/10, amazing graphics!" -IGN
[01:20:24] <pom_life> The power of HTML5.
[01:27:05] <Kingsy> can anyone see why I would get call to method addMethod of undefined on this --> jQuery.validator.addMethod("phoneSA", function (phone_number, element) { ?
[01:28:25] <pom_life> validator is undefined
[01:28:36] <pom_life> do a console.log on jQuery.validator
[01:29:25] <Kingsy> pom_life: yeah its undefined.. how do you add that object to jQuery ?
[01:29:29] <Kingsy> so I can add a method to it
[01:29:43] <Cork> you need to load the form validator lib
[01:30:24] <Kingsy> Cork: this example works... does 1.8 have it built in or something?
[01:30:33] <Kingsy> http://jsfiddle.net/dSz5j/
[01:30:41] <Cork> no it doesn'
[01:30:44] <Cork> *t
[01:30:58] <Cork> check the external resources accordion
[01:31:00] <Kingsy> so how come that jsfiddle works? thats pretty much what I am trying to do
[01:31:11] <Kingsy> ah ha
[01:31:33] <Kingsy> thanks, makes sense now
[01:41:09] <jomofcw> Hello ! is there a way to replace an element by another one ? replace with replace the element and its content, I just want to replace the element itself.
[01:41:50] <Cork> ?api replaceWith
[01:41:50] <b-ot> Cork: .replaceWith(): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[01:42:46] <jomofcw> Cork hello =). Yea but as said, it replace the content too :/. Whet I want is to replace <strong>content</strong> by <span>content</span>.
[01:43:02] <Serdar> I just needed remove dataType: json
[01:43:04] <Cork> jomofcw: i would say; your doing it wrong
[01:43:13] <Cork> just add a class on the element instead
[01:43:15] <Serdar> I don't understand why, but it was the issue
[01:43:29] <jomofcw> Cork OK bad example :/ but the idea is there.
[01:43:51] <Cork> jomofcw: if you want to replace the element but keep the content
[01:44:00] <Cork> you first have to grab the text content from that element
[01:44:00] <Serdar> for the parsererror, but still my php is not called :(
[01:44:07] <Cork> and then move the child elements to the new elements
[01:44:18] <Cork> and then position the text correctly in the new element
[01:44:28] <Cork> and then replace the old element with the new fragment
[01:44:45] <Cork> jomofcw: alternatively you can serialize the child elements to html and replace all of it
[01:44:57] <Cork> jomofcw: but then you will lost all listeners and js bindings
[01:45:11] <jomofcw> Cork OK I understand ! Thanks for your help =).
[01:45:11] <Cork> so, ya you should REALLY look into doing this with css instead
[01:45:19] <Cork> as that is almost always doable
[01:45:38] <Cork> (and for the very few situations it isn't you can't have children, like ex. <input type="password">
[01:45:39] <Cork> )
[02:06:30] <PatBateman> where to search for error when my ajax call to a php file generates a page refresh?
[02:15:13] <Cork> PatBateman: you most likely don't do event.preventDefault() on the orignal event that started the ajax call
[02:22:38] <PatBateman> Cork: but , I have e.preventDefault
[02:22:56] <PatBateman> what should I do at the end of php file?
[02:22:58] <Cork> well ajax doens't cause page reloads
[02:23:00] <PatBateman> echo 'ok';
[02:23:20] <PatBateman> then exit; ?
[02:23:34] <Cork> depends on what data you want to send back
[02:23:45] <Cork> you don't need to run exit
[02:23:46] <PatBateman> nothing , or just ok
[02:23:51] <Cork> except if you want to skip some part
[02:24:02] <Cork> well then you don't need to do anything
[02:24:08] <Cork> then you will just send an empty response
[02:24:11] <Cork> but again
[02:24:20] <Cork> the reload CAN'T be caused by the ajax
[02:28:41] <Serdar> $head->desk();
[02:29:20] <jomofcw> I would like to get each element that have no child except '<br/>'. is it possible with a single selector ?
[02:29:25] <krz> any coffeescript users here?
[02:29:28] <krz> whats the equivalent of this Stripe.getToken (token, function(status, response){}) in coffeescript?
[02:29:45] <Cork> jomofcw: no
[02:29:57] <Cork> jomofcw: css can't select upwards
[02:30:11] <Cork> you should never design a page to work like that
[02:34:28] <jomofcw> Cork OK.
[02:35:07] <PatBateman> Cork: thanks
[02:37:14] <PatBateman> Cork: should I set a header for this php file?
[02:37:31] <Cork> depends on what you return
[02:37:41] <PatBateman> i see
[02:37:44] <Cork> if you return json, yet
[02:37:52] <Cork> *yes
[02:39:35] <zulcc> i've got this http://jsfiddle.net/gYFUr/ but it removes the selectability of the found items and removes the usual "button-like" styling on item selection. how do i get these behaviours/stylings back?
[02:43:48] <zulcc> isn't that just a fairly normal li class that i have to apply?
[02:43:56] <PatBateman> strange.. I added a done funcion, with an alert. after the alert shows up, happens the page refresh
[02:44:07] <PatBateman> in a half second
[02:48:34] <PatBateman> Cork: i get the Firebug message in Net: Reload the page to get source for: http://localhost/site/intranet/jcart/relay2.php
[02:48:52] <PatBateman> in the Response
[02:49:00] <krz> whats the equivalent of doing foo = bar || nil
[02:49:10] <krz> thats ruby ^^
[02:49:19] <Cork> foo = bar || null
[02:49:31] <krz> so if bar is nil. foo is nil
[02:49:39] <Cork> foo = bar then
[02:50:11] <Cork> krz: that line doesn't really make sense in any of those languages
[02:50:36] <anli> I want to create a toggle button using kendo
[02:50:43] <anli> Cant find a property for that
[02:50:56] <anli> Is there one?
[02:51:52] <anli> Maybe I should use some other widget, like panel bar
[02:54:01] <zulcc> i applied class="ui-menu-item" to 'return $('<li class="ui-menu-item"></li>')' and that brought the selectability back, but not the item styling. i guess either the <li> or the <ul> also has other classes applied by default...
[02:57:07] <krambiorix> how can i get a field with class input-amount in the last columns of a table ?
[02:57:08] <anli> Why not <li/> instead of <li></li>
[02:57:20] <anli> @zulcc
[02:57:50] <anli> zulcc: that li should have that class
[02:58:03] <anli> Unless .removeClass has been used somewhere
[02:58:47] <zulcc> because im trying to create working code at the moment, not beautify it. so i didn't really bother... the code you see is everything i added, yet it's disabling the styling like that. wait a sec, ill recreate the case completely
[02:58:49] <monir> I have jquery tab in codeigniter form.  form validation is not working direct
[02:59:01] <monir> when i clicked on tab then it works
[02:59:51] <krambiorix> i'll rephrase my question:  how can i check if $(this) is placed in the last column of a table?
[03:00:36] <Cork> krambiorix: $(this).closest('td').index()
[03:16:03] <vedic> Hey guys, I am new to ng. I have done a lot of jquery and jquery-ui. But a friend of mine suggested to checkout ng. I am also looking at twitter's bootstrap as I don't like jquery-ui any more. I want to know, what is your preferred ui libraries if you use ng without jquery at all?
[03:16:09] <poseid> anyone know where this $(this.make(…)) syntax is coming from? I discovered that in a backbone view
[03:17:34] <zulcc> why isn't this working now http://jsfiddle.net/wAec6/
[03:20:18] <pingo> What is faster, $('[data-control="WindowContent"]') or $('div[data-Control="WindowContent"]') ?
[03:21:15] <Cork> pingo: the second one
[03:21:26] <Cork> $('[data-control="WindowContent"]') === $('*[data-control="WindowContent"]')
[03:21:42] <Cork> the second one at least limits the element loop to the divs in the page
[03:23:20] <krz> why is this returning a type error: (typeof(token_response) === 'undefined' ? $("[data-stripe=number]").val() : 'a')
[03:23:34] <krz> TypeError: $(...) is null
[03:24:02] <Cork> krz: looks like you don't have jquery loaded
[03:24:10] <Cork> or something has taken $
[03:24:41] <BinaryKi1ten> (function($) { /* your code here */ })(jQuery); <-- possible fix
[03:26:03] <phryk> Hey there, can someone tell me how jquery plugins inject functions into DOM objects (my terminology might be wrong, i'm not much of a javascript dev)?
[03:27:20] <Cork> zulcc: http://jsfiddle.net/wAec6/1/ ?
[03:28:01] <Cork> phryk: jquery and it's plugins normally don't add functions to the dom
[03:28:15] <Cork> phryk: jquery have a separate object/class it works from
[03:28:22] <Cork> and plugins extend that object instead
[03:28:33] <Cork> ex $.fn.youPluginName = function() {}
[03:28:43] <grafi> Cork you ever heard of ios safari having problems with jquery events?
[03:28:46] <krz> Cork:  seems to be complaining with this https://gist.github.com/3458f92f1a304f25f0f2
[03:28:56] <krz> SyntaxError: unexpected =
[03:28:59] <Cork> grafi: notdesktop no
[03:29:18] <Cork> grafi: iphone and tables is another matter
[03:29:23] <grafi> tell me more
[03:29:39] <Cork> well they use overlays for input fields
[03:29:52] <Cork> and that can cause you to get duplicate events and things like that
[03:30:04] <grafi> hm
[03:30:08] <Cork> as ex. click events actually happen on the overlay and they retrigger it on the real element
[03:30:15] <Cork> so you can get two events in the page
[03:30:31] <grafi> but can that lead to the click thing not working?
[03:30:36] <phryk> Cork: Oh right, the function is added to the array(?) of elements I get back when calling jquery. Just solved my problem, thanks ;)
[03:30:43] <Cork> grafi: possibly
[03:30:47] <zulcc> Cork: argh, thanks. ""... yeah alright. so now the separated sample works. why do the autocompleted results not have the default styling, selectability? (or rather: how do i add that back in?)
[03:30:51] <grafi> hm
[03:30:51] <sifu> gosh i am being daft but i am trying to create a fiddle (http://jsfiddle.net/QjpE3/) of the BBC carousel (http://www.bbc.co.uk/frameworks/gelui/guides/carousel) but can't seem to even get started :| any pointers would be greatly appreciated
[03:30:56] <grafi> interesting
[03:30:57] <grafi> thanks
[03:31:09] <Cork> they also have a few situations where floating elements and things like that can't go above form elements
[03:31:17] <Cork> and a long list of other annoying bugs
[03:31:47] <Cork> zulcc: the autocomplete dropdown DEPENDS on the a tags
[03:31:52] <Cork> so you have to have them
[03:32:05] <Cork> annoying like hell, but...
[03:32:24] <zulcc> Cork: AAaaaaaaahhhh! thanks a lot!
[03:34:23] <Cork> phryk: you get a jquery object back; it isn't a real array, it is array like
[03:35:10] <Cork> basically ['a'] vs {'0':'a', length: 1}
[03:50:38] <fRAiLtY-> How to order these divs based on the response from AJAX, included in the fiddle. The response is an array and the divs use the id format div_XXXXX where XXXXX is the number from the array http://jsfiddle.net/pDK6L/1/
[03:50:48] <Serdar> hmm should I learn angular or not...
[04:17:57] <PatBateman> Cork: back to my question, you said jquery doesnt do a refresh. I replaced the ajax's php file with an empty one, except echo 'ok'; is inside. The refresh happens this time also.
[04:18:32] <Cork> PatBateman: yes, most likely cause the event you trigger to do the ajax call
[04:18:35] <Cork> isn't blocked
[04:18:46] <Cork> so if you remove the ajax call all together you would STILL get the reload
[04:18:47] <dwarder> is there a selector type that is opposite i.e. $('div !#this a')    the link that is inside a div that doesn't have id='this'
[04:19:00] <PatBateman> trying it
[04:19:09] <drager> How can I register only the keycode === 13 when a specific element is visible?
[04:19:13] <fRAiLtY-> How to order these divs based on the response from AJAX, included in the fiddle. The response is an array and the divs use the id format div_XXXXX where XXXXX is the number from the array http://jsfiddle.net/pDK6L/1/
[04:19:13] <Cork> dwarder: $('div a').not(this)
[04:19:32] <dwarder> Cork: .not('#this') ?
[04:19:36] <Cork> no
[04:19:42] <Cork> unless this is an id
[04:19:46] <dwarder> it is
[04:19:49] <Cork> O_o
[04:19:50] <Cork> ok
[04:19:52] <Cork> then ya
[04:20:10] <Cork> (that is one lousy id btw)
[04:20:13] <dwarder> well, yeah bad example
[04:20:33] <drager> https://dpaste.de/Lu79
[04:20:33] <dwarder> $('div!#notthisid a')
[04:20:38] <PatBateman> Cork: right it not the ajax call hmm...
[04:20:57] <Cork> dwarder: $('div:not(#id) a')
[04:21:12] <dwarder> Cork: thank you
[04:21:18] <Cork> dwarder: but be careful will negative parent selectors
[04:21:23] <Cork> it is VERY easy to break those
[04:21:51] <Cork> <div id="avoid"><div><a></a></div></div> <--
[04:21:57] <Cork> that selector would match
[04:22:09] <Cork> <div><div id="avoid"><a></a></div></div> <-- same here
[04:22:35] <Cork> $('div:not(#avoid) a') selector
[04:22:37] <Cork> dwarder: ^
[04:24:40] <drager> Any idea?
[04:24:54] <Cork> drager: opps i missed to type the answer :x
[04:24:56] <Cork> you can't
[04:25:15] <Cork> you would have to bind a constant listener and then check the visibility and keycode in the callback
[04:25:26] <drager> well, I change my question
[04:25:51] <drager> I need the keydown only to be grabbed by a anchor tag with an specfic ID
[04:25:59] <drager> and then run the function
[04:26:19] <Cork> well that would only work if the tag has focus
[04:26:36] <Cork> if you do that it would just work with a straight normal event listener
[04:26:45] <Cork> but you would have to handle the focus part
[04:26:56] <drager> well, maybe I should just do it on the input then?
[04:27:19] <Cork> well the same rule applies to all elements except forms
[04:30:57] <drager> hm
[04:32:09] <jeremib> I have a table of rows.  I am implementing the ability to click one row, then shift-click another row and it apply the a class to all rows in between.  I have this working, but the text in the rows is actually selected, is there anyway to prevent this or fix this?
[04:32:35] <jeremib> I tried event.preventDefault() but it doesn't work, at least not in FF
[04:33:02] <Cork> jeremib: you would either have to fiddle with the text selection values
[04:33:20] <Cork> or use the user-select css value to prevent the selection from happening
[04:33:40] <jeremib> ok Cork, i'll look into those things.  thanks
[04:35:45] <paulvd> how can i get the width of the background image ?
[04:36:00] <Cork> you can't
[04:36:09] <fRAiLtY-> How to order these divs based on the response from AJAX, included in the fiddle. The response is an array and the divs use the id format div_XXXXX where XXXXX is the number from the array http://jsfiddle.net/pDK6L/1/
[04:36:23] <Cork> well tecnically you could load it in a canvas and get the width from there
[04:36:28] <paulvd> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5106243/how-do-i-get-background-image-size-in-jquery
[04:37:04] <paulvd> are those bogus?
[04:37:37] <Cork> well no they create an <img> element and do the same thing from there
[04:37:54] <Cork> but the answer is "you can't get the width from background images"
[04:38:03] <Cork> you can load it somewhere else and grab it there
[04:38:03] <sacho_> fRAiLtY-, jquery collections are not indexed by ids
[04:38:10] <Cork> but not from css background images
[04:38:37] <fRAiLtY-> sacho_:  Hmm, I  need to sort them by those numbers - somehow
[04:39:33] <sacho_> brb but I don't think you can sort jquery collections directly
[04:39:41] <Cork> you can
[04:39:48] <Cork> ?api sort
[04:39:48] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:39:54] <fRAiLtY-> Cork? Any suggestions on the above fiddle?
[04:39:55] <Cork> hmm
[04:40:01] <Cork> ?api jquery.sort
[04:40:02] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[04:40:10] <Cork> oh right you use the array sort on it
[04:42:23] <fRAiLtY-> Cork? https://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/arrays/#sort-
[04:42:54] <Cork> ya
[04:43:03] <fRAiLtY-> But I don't want to sort the array, I want to use the array to sort the divs?
[04:43:21] <Cork> jquery is array like remember?
[04:43:31] <Cork> could sort it based on the id
[04:43:43] <fRAiLtY-> even though my id's are div_445345 etc?

[04:46:05] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/shAe3/
[04:46:34] <masscrx_> this is my script: http://pastie.org/8733123
[04:46:38] <masscrx_> is very simple ;]
[04:46:51] <Cork> masondesu___: $("input[type='checkbox']").not(':checked')
[04:46:54] <Jattenalle> masscrx_, $("input[type='checkbox']:not(:checked)")
[04:47:16] <Jattenalle> oh, you need to encode the not in quotes
[04:47:18] <masscrx_> but can you check my link and tell me where i should put it ?
[04:47:22] <Jattenalle> err, encapsulate
[04:47:39] <Cork> Jattenalle: no, i used a taled function
[04:48:02] <Jattenalle> Cork, a what?
[04:48:09] <Jattenalle> oh, i see
[04:48:32] <Cork> so your example was perfectly valid
[04:48:48] <Jattenalle> yeah i see the difference now, sneaky . vs : hiding in the middle there
[04:49:18] <Cork> Jattenalle: well i tend to stay away from :<function> when possible
[04:49:28] <Jattenalle> any particular reason?
[04:49:33] <Cork> as they are slower then the .function counter part
[04:49:37] <Jattenalle> ah
[04:49:39] <specious> yep, performance
[04:49:47] <Cork> as it first has to go through the sizzle parser
[04:49:59] <Cork> and be called for each element in the selector
[04:50:14] <masscrx_> so guys where to put code and which exactly
[04:50:18] <masscrx_> with . or with :
[04:50:47] <Cork> masscrx_: it is your choice really
[04:50:50] <Cork> both work
[04:51:13] <Cork> in addition to the speed difference i just find the format i typed easier to read
[04:51:15] <masscrx_> ok but in which place? i dont know jquery but i must change this
[04:51:22] <Cork> (less string magic)
[04:51:39] <Cork> ...
[04:51:50] <Cork> masscrx_: you should not change code you don't understand
[04:52:12] <Cork> ask someone in your coding team that can understand it to do it for you
[04:52:20] <masscrx_> Cork: please dont tell me what i should ;] i dont have coding team
[04:52:21] <specious> lol
[04:52:37] <Cork> masscrx_: so you mean your copy pasting some random code from the net?
[04:52:44] <Cork> still BAD idea
[04:52:45] <Jattenalle> 'attaboy! that's the attitude that gets you answers! :D
[04:52:58] <masscrx_> Cork: no, this is code from one website on my server
[04:53:12] <specious> pfff... I learned to code by changing code I didn't understand :)
[04:53:13] <masscrx_> im system administrator, no webdeveloper
[04:53:26] <Cork> masscrx_: so ask the one that wrote it for you to help you
[04:53:48] <Jattenalle> specious, change all the things until it breaks/works, ship it! gold.
[04:53:50] <Cork> fiddling with sections of code you don't know and don't care about is bound to break things
[04:54:18] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Sorry don't think I'm explaining it very well, I have an array like so: ["61968","53289","53844","56647","60381","60764","61567","64068","65918","66520"]  and div's with those ID's in the format div_52389. How do I sort them divs based on that array? http://jsfiddle.net/pDK6L/1/
[04:54:41] <masscrx_> fRAiLtY-: ask your coding team ;]
[04:55:04] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[04:55:21] <Jattenalle> just ignore him fRAiLtY-, he's upset because people don't write code for him
[04:55:30] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you would have to match the string in the array with the id for the element
[04:56:12] <Cork> so something like $items.filter('[id="div_' + response[i] + '"]')
[04:56:23] <Cork> hmm actually
[04:56:29] <fRAiLtY-> Jattenalle:  got it!
[04:56:32] <PatBateman> Cork: finally i find, the form was normally submitted, now I dont have a refresh. but this time, the form field arent sent to the php, only the clicked button, and this is also undefined
[04:56:34] <Cork> so something like $items.filter('#div_' + response[i])
[04:56:36] <Cork> much better
[04:56:38] <PatBateman> paste:
[04:57:00] <masscrx_> Jattenalle: i dont want code from you, only little fast advice: masscrx put in between 3 and 4 line with if statement
[04:57:12] <Cork> PatBateman: you should use the submit event on the form
[04:57:20] <Cork> not click events on buttons
[04:57:30] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Is that within the for loop that's there already yeah?
[04:57:40] <Cork> ya
[04:58:12] <Cork> temp.push($items.filter('#div_' + response[i])[0])
[04:58:16] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ^
[04:59:39] <PatBateman> Crok: working
[04:59:49] <PatBateman> thank for the advices
[04:59:53] <Cork> np
[05:00:12] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Hmm, Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #div_[
[05:00:18] <fRAiLtY-> unusual
[05:00:19] <Cork> no []
[05:00:37] <Cork> temp.push($items.filter('#div_' + response[i])[0]) <--
[05:00:45] <PatBateman> Crok: after the refresh problem, I had to change closest('form') to parents('form') only that way worked..
[05:01:04] <Cork> PatBateman: huh?
[05:01:09] <PatBateman> ah
[05:01:11] <PatBateman> nevermind
[05:01:17] <PatBateman> :)
[05:01:21] <Cork> ^^'
[05:03:04] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Do you mean I should remove the [? My code is as you pasted still getting the error. I see on your previous paste you did + '"]' at the end but not on these ones presumably because you've dropped the [id=^
[05:03:24] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i posted an updated version
[05:04:19] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Yes, temp.push($items.filter('#div_' + response[i])[0]), but still gives me the same error
[05:04:20] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: [id="div_ is pointless if you can do #div_ instead
[05:04:33] <Cork> then response[i] isn't a string
[05:06:44] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  response = ["60764","66520","64068","60381","53844","65918","61968","61567","56647","53289"]
[05:08:15] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/pDK6L/11/
[05:13:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  I'm confused, because if I console.log(response) I get effectively that above, but it doesn't work?
[05:14:08] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: is response an array or a string?
[05:14:28] <Cork> console.log(typeof(response))
[05:15:50] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Ah, it's a string
[05:16:05] <Cork> so config the server to send json!
[05:16:16] <Cork> (Content-Type: application/json)
[05:20:20] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, swapped to json and it works, awesome thanks Cork
[05:20:27] <Cork> yw
[05:26:42] <krambiorix> hi, i would like to get the class of a field starting with 'code_'    -> is that possible?
[05:27:51] <Cork> "field"?
[05:27:56] <Cork> are you talking about an input?
[05:28:22] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[05:28:34] <Cork> $('input[name^="code_"]').attr('class')
[05:29:03] <krambiorix> Cork,  i want to do something like  var code = $('input...)
[05:29:14] <krambiorix> i want to get the class that starts with code_
[05:29:23] <krambiorix> because the input field has multiple classes
[05:29:39] <Cork> krambiorix: ig you should never use partial class names
[05:29:44] <Cork> split up the classes instead
[05:30:09] <Cork> class="code_foo" => class="code foo"
[05:30:30] <krambiorix> Cork, yeah but the code is always a number like   code_64
[05:30:35] <krambiorix> or code_9303
[05:30:37] <Cork> ah
[05:30:42] <Cork> then it doens't belong in class
[05:30:49] <Cork> add a data-code=""
[05:30:59] <krambiorix> ow ok
[05:31:15] <Cork> $('input[data-code=""]')
[05:32:15] <krambiorix> Cork, great !!! Thanks a lot! (again)
[05:32:20] <Cork> np
[05:33:41] <krambiorix> Cork,  isn't $('input[data-code=""]'  much slower than $('input .code_65')?
[05:34:09] <Cork> well attribute selectors is slower
[05:34:22] <Cork> but if you limit it to a controlled number of elements it shouldn't matter
[05:34:32] <Cork> ex form.find('input[]')
[05:34:41] <Cork> instead of searching the entire page
[05:36:34] <krambiorix> Cork, ow ok, but now i get: $(this).data('code').replace('code_') -> is not a function
[05:36:59] <Cork> krambiorix: why replace
[05:37:08] <Cork> just do $(this).data('code', number)
[05:37:23] <Cork> krambiorix: though warning if you use data it won't update the attribute on the dom element
[05:37:29] <krambiorix> ow of course
[05:37:53] <Cork> so you might want to use attr('data-code', number)
[05:38:19] <PatBateman> thats new for me, but good info
[05:41:08] <DarsVaeda> not sure this is a valid question here: what is my best option to make ajaxed content search engine friendly
[05:41:32] <Cork> DarkGhost: uh...
[05:41:41] <Cork> DarkGhost: by having a none ajax version
[05:41:57] <Cork> meaning make a standard page and then optimize its speed with ajax
[05:43:32] <ankurk> How can I sort dates in a table without a plugin?
[05:43:54] <Cork> ankurk: pick the element in the table row you want to sort after
[05:44:00] <Cork> and move the tr element based on it
[05:46:14] <ankurk> Cork: I am trying like this
[05:46:16] <ankurk> https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9001222
[05:47:14] <Cork> what is the content of the value you give you date?
[05:47:20] <Cork> (an example)
[05:47:50] <ankurk> mean? Dates are like this, "Aug 22 2013", "Feb 05 2014", "Feb 05 2014", "Feb 10 2014", "Feb 11 2014", "Feb 11 2014", "Feb 11 2014", "Feb 11 2014", "Feb 12 2014", "Feb 12 2014", "Feb 12 2014", "Feb 12 2014", "Sep 20 2013"]
[05:47:56] <DarsVaeda> hmm an iframe in an noscript seems like a good solution
[05:48:03] <DarsVaeda> but thanks cork :)
[05:48:24] <Cork> DarsVaeda: ugg...
[05:48:48] <Cork> sounds like you've constructed the page backwards
[05:51:16] <Cork> ankurk: something like this should get you going http://jsfiddle.net/zzXhx/
[05:53:25] <skypce> how can i leave popup right when hover always enabled? http://skypce.chickenkiller.com/bz/
[05:54:52] <ankurk> Cork: hmm, let me try
[06:06:42] <ddssc> anyone knows how exactly I'm supposed to use this? http://datatables.net/plug-ins/api#fnColumnIndexToVisible
[06:06:57] <ddssc> these datatables are cryptic as fuck
[06:07:19] <ddssc> oh btw, this http://next.datatables.net/plug-ins/api/fnColumnIndexToVisible doesn't work either.
[06:08:00] <mrboe> hey guys, i want to set equal heights to a 3col container (i tried this: https://gist.github.com/misterboe/9001475) but the i got a problem when i use 2 of these on one page (the first 3 col container sets the height of teh second)
[06:17:34] <decx> rewrite it to apply to the parent container maybe
[06:19:33] <interop_madness> if i have a .click() event handler attached to a dynamically generated DOM element and i remove said element by invoking .html("") on its parent (or grandparents further up the DOM tree), does this constitute a memory leak, seeing that i didn't unsubscribe the event handler before removal of the element?
[06:24:02] <drager> Cork: You remmber you helped me yesterday with the ajax call? I do not get "fresh" data on the request. I get fresh data if i refresh the page though (from the ajax call)
[06:29:14] <drager> Cork: Never mind, just did; $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
[06:31:48] <poupi> y a t il des français ici ?
[06:50:10] <PatBateman> can I remove a class that is the searched class? its doesnt seem to work. so $('.class').removeClass('.class')
[06:50:33] <Cork> PatBateman: yes you can
[06:50:44] <PatBateman> so have to search why not works
[06:51:21] <Cork> PatBateman: i hope the class name isn't actually "class"
[06:51:45] <PatBateman> no :)
[06:52:03] <Cork> then it should work
[06:52:11] <Cork> create a fiddle if you need more help
[06:52:35] <PatBateman> ok
[06:55:35] <skypce> guys
[06:55:36] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/fxWGWRUq
[06:56:17] <skypce> how can i maintain the last hover position when i hover out of .product?
[07:06:15] <ankurk> I think I can sort dates in the table now, but now the issue is how would I move the rows according to the sorted dates?
[07:19:44] <BillCriswell> Cork: Can you think of a way to tell if an overflown div is scrolled all the way to either side?
[07:20:07] <BillCriswell> scrolled left is easy, scrolled right I can't think of a way that doesn't involve calculating its contents width.
[07:20:46] <Cork> BillCriswell: scrollTop scrollLeft
[07:20:53] <Cork> and scrollHeight and scrollWidth
[07:24:24] <Siecje> How can you highlight something when you mouse over something else?
[07:24:57] <Cork> Siecje: you would have to set a class on element 2 when element 1 is hovered
[07:31:02] <WebDragon> if you wanted to display a selection of options in a form, based on the previous choices, and have them change if the user chooses something else at the beginning of the form's options, what is that called? my google-fu is weak at the moment, being only just awake and not caffeinated yet
[07:31:28] <BillCriswell> Cork: Thanks.
[07:37:12] <Siecje> Cork: how do I remove it when no longer mouse over?
[07:39:15] <Cork> Siecje: same thing
[07:39:29] <Cork> just remove the class when the element is left
[07:42:42] <Siecje> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/b69Ne/ How do I know when not hover?
[07:43:23] <BillCriswell> Can't believe I never used scrollWidth
[07:43:25] <Cork> ?api mouseenter
[07:43:25] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseenter(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/
[07:43:29] <Cork> ?api mouseleave
[07:43:30] <b-ot> Cork: .mouseleave(): Bind an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element. http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/
[07:43:58] <Siecje> is a function an event? Okay I will try it.
[07:44:29] <Cork> Siecje: no, an event is something the browser fires
[07:44:50] <Cork> the function names in jquery is just shorthands for .on('mouseleave' ...)
[07:45:06] <Cork> (and mouseleave, mouseenter is helper fake event jquery creates)
[07:45:15] <Cork> the real evens are mouseover mouseout
[07:48:17] <PatBateman> please help in the following : http://hastebin.com/kehutuxajo.xml
[07:50:37] <PatBateman> ok
[07:50:40] <PatBateman> im tired
[07:50:51] <PatBateman> removeClass without the dot
[07:51:18] <Cork> ya
[07:51:28] <Cork> cause removeClass only works with classes
[07:51:32] <Cork> not selectors
[07:51:51] <PatBateman> exactly
[07:52:52] <PatBateman> lol google.com has an actual design :)
[07:53:25] <Cork> "actual"?
[07:53:46] <PatBateman> sorry, current
[07:54:12] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[07:54:36] <Cork> or do you mean the doodle?
[07:54:37] <PatBateman> today is valentine's day .. and google made a design for that
[07:54:46] <Cork> ya, they normally do
[07:54:52] <Cork> for different events
[07:54:58] <PatBateman> ah yeah this is the doodle ?
[07:55:09] <Cork> ?g google doodles
[07:55:11] <b-ot> Cork: Doodles - Google → http://www.google.com/doodles/
[07:55:39] <PatBateman> thx
[07:55:52] <Cork> bt you know it is interactive right? :D
[07:56:06] <PatBateman> hm
[07:56:35] <PatBateman> changes on hover or ? :)
[07:56:58] <Cork> make your own chocolate :)
[07:57:05] <Cork> PatBateman: quite far from it
[07:57:06] <PatBateman> ah so
[07:57:08] <Cork> click the play button
[07:58:01] <PatBateman> lol
[07:58:04] <PatBateman> got it
[07:58:13] <PatBateman> I added an ant to the cookie hehe
[07:58:35] <PatBateman> i guess its nice html5 maybe canvas thingie
[07:59:17] <Cork> ya
[08:07:53] <ddssc> what's the best way to serialize a js object into a json string for purpose of sending via ajax?
[08:08:43] <Cork> JSON.stringify(obj)
[08:08:43] <ddssc> JSON.stringify() is throwing erorrs.
[08:08:47] <ddssc> heh
[08:08:58] <ddssc> and also isn't that browser dependent?
[08:09:06] <Cork> then you have data in the object that can't be serialzied
[08:09:24] <Cork> ddssc: you might need to use json2.js for old ie
[08:09:33] <Cork> the rest of them support it
[08:10:37] <sacho_> ddssc, errors like?
[08:10:47] <Cork> ddssc: so anyone if you have a value in the object that throws you need to replace it with a object primitive that can be converted to json
[08:10:56] <Cork> *anyway
[08:11:21] <Cork> json can only represent string, number array and objects
[08:11:29] <Cork> every thing else isn't supported
[08:11:52] <ddssc> sacho_: Uncaught TypeError: Accessing selectionDirection on an input element that cannot have a selection.
[08:12:17] <Cork> so you have dom elements in the objecy
[08:12:21] <Cork> *object
[08:12:28] <Cork> specifically an input element
[08:12:42] <ddssc> myea... actually it's the fnGetSelected from datatables array of objects..
[08:13:07] <ddssc> guess I'll have to write my own function
[08:13:31] <Cork> ddssc: you should write your own filter
[08:13:41] <Cork> that removes data that shouldn't be there
[08:13:59] <Cork> but you should always feed it through JSON so you know it actually is valid json
[08:15:14] <ankurk> Guys, I can now sort dates in the table, now I want to reorder the rows according to sorted dates :(
[08:15:25] <ankurk> I can't figure out how would I do that
[08:15:43] <Cork> ankurk: didn't i give you an example of how to do that?
[08:15:58] <ankurk> Cork: This is what I am upto now, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9003846
[08:16:17] <Cork> so you didn't use the example...
[08:16:28] <Cork> oh well
[08:16:44] <ankurk> But now the issue is how would I reorder the rows according to sorted dates
[08:16:59] <ankurk> Cork: I used this instead, https://gist.github.com/onpubcom/1772996
[08:17:02] <Cork> if you used the example i gave you, you would have it sorted now
[08:17:12] <Cork> as it did the sorting and reordering
[08:17:36] <sacho_> ddssc, you can write toJSON functions for those objects
[08:17:37] <ankurk> hmm, let me try again
[08:18:27] <DarkStompy> IE8 problem (I know that we all love IE). The first time I load a page it jQuery does not load and run but after reloading the page it runs fine. What is causing it?
[08:18:33] <ankurk> Cork: It's not working for some reason
[08:19:54] <ankurk> Here's the table Cork, that I am trying to sort, http://imgur.com/TSkpP2J
[08:20:04] <ankurk> I am sorting the Added column
[08:20:09] <Cork> ankurk: please no images
[08:20:20] <ankurk> Sorry
[08:20:22] <Cork> if you need help getting things working make an example with running code
[08:20:44] <drager> I'm trying to "shake" an element on click; http://jsfiddle.net/e9uqt/1/ it works but I don't want users be able to spam the animation.
[08:20:47] <drager> Ideas?
[08:25:32] <drager> Can I prepopulate a field with the name of a uploaded file?
[08:25:39] <drager> woops, wrong channel
[08:25:54] <BillCriswell> drager: You can check if element is :animated before doing the animation.
[08:26:16] <drager> BillCriswell: Yeah, I thought of that. But hm, I have taht loop there
[08:26:25] <drager> and it will stop after one iteration?
[08:29:08] <ankurk> The error with your code I am getting is this: Property 'children' of object #<HTMLTableRowElement> is not a function
[08:30:19] <arpin> drager: add some property to the element like animdisabled=1, then use setTimeout to enable it again
[08:30:20] <BillCriswell> drager: It would still be fine I think.
[08:31:10] <ashgotti> Hello all. I'm having a very frustrating issue where my popups and panels don't work on any page except my landing page. If I navigate to my secondary pages, they don't work. If I refresh or manually go to the secondary pages, they do work. Any idea what could be causing this?
[08:32:12] <drager> BillCriswell: Hm, like how?
[08:32:54] <drager> arpin: Hm
[08:33:20] <BillCriswell> drager: http://jsfiddle.net/e9uqt/2/
[08:33:45] <BillCriswell> ankurk: It sounds like you're trying to use a jquery function on a regular DOM element.
[08:34:21] <ankurk> Basically I am trying to sort Dates and reorder the rows on basis of that
[08:34:26] <drager> BillCriswell: Sweet, thanks
[08:36:55] <BillCriswell> ankurk: What formats are the dates in?
[08:37:23] <ankurk> Like this, Aug 22 2013
[08:38:28] <BillCriswell> You would need to get that date into a format you could actually sort.. unless you want the order actually be alphabetical.
[08:39:00] <BillCriswell> Man, Class of Nuke 'Em High is so terrible that it's good.
[08:39:26] <ankurk> BillCriswell: I am actually doing this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9003846
[08:39:46] <WebDragon> the Y-m-d format is the best sortable -- what is that, ISO8601 ?
[08:40:03] <WebDragon> yep
[08:40:26] <WebDragon> don't ask me how I can remember that, but can't remember to set my damn alarm clock before going to bed
[08:41:25] <ankurk> But I am clueless on how to reorder the columns
[08:41:32] <ankurk> err rows
[08:44:02] <BillCriswell> ankurk: I like a little plugin called tinysort.
[08:44:55] <ankurk> BillCriswell: I am avoiding plugins :(
[08:46:25] <ankurk> I think there might be a way
[08:46:32] <seutje> heh, most of us avoid reinventing the wheel :D
[08:47:36] <BillCriswell> I don't mind plugins that are tiny like this one. When they're big I'm way more hesitant... You have to weigh out how much it's worth to you.
[08:47:42] <BillCriswell> http://tinysort.sjeiti.com/dist/jquery.tinysort.min.js is pretty minimal
[08:48:56] <ankurk> I would go ahead and use this one but my supervisor suggests me to not to use libraries
[08:49:25] <BillCriswell> You're using jQuery though.
[08:49:47] <BillCriswell> Do you plan on sorting by anything besides the date?
[08:49:55] <ankurk> yeah, actually the page I am working on uses YUI
[08:50:23] <NoiseEee> ankurk: don't mix libraries.
[08:50:28] <NoiseEee> ankurk: jquery OR yiu
[08:50:34] <NoiseEee> or wf it is
[08:51:35] <ankurk> NoiseEee: Well, I would have used one but guy who worked on this mixed up a lot of stuff
[08:52:59] <BillCriswell> ankurk: http://jsfiddle.net/MikeGrace/Vgavb/ Found this on stackoverflow. Could be useful to you.
[08:54:35] <ankurk> hmm, but the data is in a div in this one, mine is in a table
[08:55:54] <BillCriswell> It's just an element though.
[08:58:12] <ankurk> you're right
[09:00:02] <evangeline> hi
[09:00:34] <evangeline> does anybody know why the flexigrid doesn't work: http://dpaste.com/1618784/ ... the table appears normally as if it was not flexigrid table ?
[09:06:32] <codepython777> Does anyone have any suggestions on how i can implement search functionality on this page: http://bit.ly/pythonclass? I would like to provide a search box, and automatically jump to the slide on which the word is present.
[09:06:48] <dftc> evangeline: have you got this on a URL somewhere?
[09:07:18] <evangeline> dftc, no, internal only
[09:07:41] <evangeline> dftc, but I can change the code if you have any ideas what might be wrong ?
[09:08:11] <dftc> evangeline: are you getting any console errors?
[09:09:24] <evangeline> dftc, yes: http://shrani.najdi.si/?3J/xs/3JqSfW9T/script1.png
[09:11:17] <dftc> evangeline: check your network tab and make sure you're not getting 404 errors when loading your scripts
[09:12:04] <dftc> evangeline: alternatively you could throw it up on http://jsfiddle.net/ and include your scripts there for a live working example I can look at
[09:13:36] <phelix> I am using jquery to set the value of something on change. But when I look at the actual html its not updating. Is it just setting this in cache? Is there a way to have it set that value so it shows in the html? I need to grab this value later on with other javascript
[09:14:02] <duch_kazatel> are you looking at the page source, or in the debugger?
[09:14:06] <evangeline> dftc, ah, the doCommand is actually not defined: I copied the script from internet without understanding it ...
[09:14:12] <phelix> Looking at the page source
[09:14:24] <dftc> evangeline: i can't even see where doCommand is coming from
[09:14:28] <duch_kazatel> phelix that will never update.  that gets left alone.  Only the rendered page gets changed.
[09:14:37] <duch_kazatel> phelix are you seeing the change happen?
[09:14:48] <evangeline> dftc, now I've got "Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined" problem, which pops-up because the browser detection was removed from the latest jQuery
[09:14:57] <phelix> duch_kazatel: No not in the html only in the console
[09:15:00] <evangeline> and the flexigrid uses it
[09:15:13] <duch_kazatel> phelix I mean when looking at the page, are you seeing the value update?
[09:15:13] <dftc> evangeline: downgrade your jquery to 1x
[09:15:16] <phelix> I thought I remember reading something yesterday that there was a way to set the value
[09:15:28] <phelix> duch_kazatel: yes its populating the <input field
[09:15:32] <duch_kazatel> then it's there.
[09:15:33] <evangeline> dftc, I have 1.11 .. but I guess I have to go to 1.9
[09:15:49] <evangeline> dftc, but I won't be able to upgrade to latest jQuery then ... isn't there a better solution ?
[09:15:51] <duch_kazatel> phelix the page source won't update, but the rendered page will.
[09:16:35] <phelix> Hmm, do I have to do something special to get at that value? var testing = $('#xxx').val(); doesn't seem to be getting the data. maybe I am going about it wrong
[09:17:02] <phelix> where xxx is the id of the input field
[09:17:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix .val() is this that slider thing again?
[09:17:25] <dftc> evangeline: flexigrid hasn't been updated for a while, so compatibility moving forwards may be an issue
[09:17:38] <phelix> yes, i have it working perfectly Just trying to do a subtotal of all items at the bottom of the page
[09:17:52] <duch_kazatel> phelix you have to target the same div you targeted to init the slider.
[09:17:56] <phelix> I have it tottalling each of the individual groups
[09:18:02] <duch_kazatel> or whatever the containing element was
[09:18:11] <evangeline> dftc, yeah, I've added this script to jquery: <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.js"></script>
[09:18:23] <phelix> http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment
[09:18:34] <phelix> as you can see at the bottom of each group I am using jquery to give me the totals for that group
[09:18:57] <phelix> and that little input is being populated with jquery. I need to get those totals not each individual field
[09:19:00] <dftc> evangeline: the version they are running on their example page is http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.2.min.js
[09:19:05] <phelix> unless I can't do it that way.
[09:19:21] <duch_kazatel> phelix what are you initializing on?
[09:19:22] <dftc> which is ancient
[09:19:22] <evangeline> dftc, I'm thinking whether it would be better to use another table javascript plugin ... is there anything better, which has been updated lately?
[09:19:32] <dftc> evangeline: datatables
[09:19:34] <duch_kazatel> run val() on the element you're targeting when you're setting up the slier.
[09:19:37] <duch_kazatel> *slider
[09:19:50] <dftc> https://datatables.net/
[09:20:15] <dftc> 1.10 beta came out last week
[09:20:26] <phelix> that will give me  the grand totals of all those slider values ?
[09:20:39] <duch_kazatel> phelix it will give you the value for that slider.
[09:20:50] <duch_kazatel> phelix what's an example element you're targeting when you set up a slider?
[09:21:01] <phelix> Well I am already calculating the values at the end of each gorup.
[09:21:16] <phelix> I am trying to get the value from my group total at the bottom of each section
[09:21:34] <duch_kazatel> phelix what is an example node you're targeting when itializing a slider.
[09:21:36] <duch_kazatel> this is important.
[09:22:06] <phelix> #sample-change-keypress-464
[09:22:22] <duch_kazatel> try $('#sample-change-keypress-464').val()
[09:22:23] <phelix> and the numbers are different depending on the slider as there are about 100 on that page
[09:22:36] <phelix> yes that works
[09:22:43] <phelix> thats how I am getting the group totals
[09:22:44] <duch_kazatel> then there you go.
[09:22:56] <duch_kazatel> that's how you get the value of the field.
[09:23:00] <phelix> But now I need to take the group totals and add those.
[09:23:10] <duch_kazatel> then loop through all the groups and add them.
[09:23:29] <phelix> Well the way this drupal CMS I am using they are on 2 complete template files
[09:23:38] <phelix> its not all within a single file
[09:23:46] <duch_kazatel> your CMS does not matter.
[09:23:51] <duch_kazatel> it's rendered out to one page.
[09:24:04] <duch_kazatel> if you are still dynamically generating javascript, you're going to experience a lot of pain.
[09:24:15] <phelix> ok, so for javascript that doesn't matter? I know with php you can't pass variable info from page to page like that
[09:24:23] <duch_kazatel> define "page"
[09:24:28] <phelix> multiple files
[09:24:47] <duch_kazatel> right, but they're all rendered out to one url, right?
[09:25:02] <phelix> there is a page that renders each of those groups. Then another file that loops through that file for each group
[09:25:03] <phelix> yes
[09:25:07] <duch_kazatel> so you hit one url and see everything all at once?
[09:25:08] <phelix> all appears on a single page
[09:25:12] <phelix> yes
[09:25:21] <duch_kazatel> then it's one environment for your javascript - it's one page.
[09:25:33] <phelix> ok, didn't realize that could be done with jquery, ok I can go that route then
[09:25:34] <duch_kazatel> javascript is in the browser - it doesn't know about how things got there.
[09:25:42] <phelix> ok
[09:25:46] <duch_kazatel> just that there's a single page to work with.
[09:25:50] <phelix> thank you
[09:58:16] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I know ya said you were familiar with the nouislider. This is the one I am using. Do you have any idea how I could get the slider to be more accurate? I have the range from 0-5 and changed the width of the slider. But it seems that it will hit 5 a ways before it gets to the end. Do you know how I could go about fixing something like this? I can't find to see anything in the
[09:58:17] <phelix> documentation about changing width etc.
[09:59:07] <phelix> no matter what i set the width to. It will hit 5 and still have space at the end of the slider which is bascially dead space so to speak. Shouldn't 5 be the slider at 100%?
[10:03:09] <evangeline> hi, how would I most easily create buttons/links from letters A-Z to only display certain elements from database ... I guess it would be good if all letters are at the top of the page ?
[10:20:22] <jop008> I have this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/124/#run
[10:20:48] <jop008> In IE it looked crumbled other browsers look fine but why?
[10:25:35] <duch_kazatel> "it looked crumbled"
[10:25:41] <duch_kazatel> lol
[10:25:52] <jop008> yes not rendered okay
[10:26:06] <duch_kazatel> which version(s) of IE?
[10:26:14] <jop008> proper word for that?
[10:26:20] <jop008> IE 8 and IE9
[10:26:50] <duch_kazatel> make sure those plugins support old IE.
[10:27:08] <jop008> which plugins you mean?
[10:27:45] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/MHij4in.png
[10:27:46] <duch_kazatel> all of these?
[10:28:00] <jop008> I have a responsive table
[10:28:41] <jop008> okay I will check this
[10:30:39] <ankurk> I could be done with this sort thing but no plugin rule from my supervisor is just :(
[10:44:31] <bashusr> hi all, i'm a bit confused about what context i am in when i do parentclass = function() { $somejQueryElement.on("event", function() { this }); }
[10:44:51] <bashusr> is 'this' in the parentclass context or the $somejQueryElement context?
[10:45:37] <Jattenalle> the latter
[10:46:18] <Jattenalle> this = #somejQueryElement
[10:46:20] <bashusr> Jattenalle, is there any way for me to pass the parentclass context ?
[10:46:26] <bashusr> or to access the parentclass context?
[10:46:34] <Jattenalle> no idea
[10:47:56] <NoiseEee> bashusr:  var someThing = function() { $somejQueryElement.on("event", $.bind(function() { this },this)); }
[10:48:47] <NoiseEee> ignore the { this } which i just copied from your thang
[10:49:17] <NoiseEee> fuck me
[10:49:21] <bashusr> ???
[10:49:22] <NoiseEee> s/.bind/.proxy
[10:49:35] * bashusr googles for proxy :)
[10:49:50] <NoiseEee> var someThing = function() { $somejQueryElement.on("event", $.proxy(function() { this.someOtherMethod(); },this)); }
[10:50:05] <NoiseEee> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[10:50:12] <bashusr> yeah, thanks, looks good
[10:50:22] <bashusr> i was looking up  bind and was wondering how that was any bit related :)
[10:50:39] <NoiseEee> i think its .bind in prototype or something
[10:51:04] <Jattenalle> hm, so im looking at the jquery ui page for tabs, and adding/removing them dynamically.. http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation is that really the best way to go about it? that code seems.. well awful
[10:51:22] <santiago> Hi guys! Any of you use sublime text for coding? Do you know how can I reindent html code with it?
[10:51:26] <Jattenalle> and what's the "aria-controls" ?
[10:52:04] <bashusr> thanks NoiseEee ! Works perfectly like i want
[10:52:42] <NoiseEee> word, bashusr
[11:29:53] <ankurk> Can anyone help me with my issue of sorting table according to date? (No plugins please)
[11:32:49] <duch_kazatel> do you have a working prototype?  and why is your boss not allowing plugins?
[11:37:04] <andy_wfc> Does calling submit() on a jquery selector completely bypass the HTML onsubmit attribute?
[11:38:14] <mdev> i'm setting a textarea with jquery from a ajax return, but it's stripping out the \n
[11:38:32] <mdev> how can I preserve the \n's with the returned data?
[11:39:14] <BillCriswell> ankurk: http://jsbin.com/toqiy/1/edit?html,js,output here would be one way.
[11:41:43] <ankurk> Hey BillCriswell, I see you made data-timestamp atrribute, we can make our own attributes?
[11:41:53] <duch_kazatel> ankurk you can if you prefix with data-
[11:42:01] <ankurk> okay
[11:42:07] <BillCriswell> Yes, what duch_kazatel says goes!
[11:42:42] <duch_kazatel> pfff.
[11:42:44] <duch_kazatel> not necessarily.
[11:42:44] <BillCriswell> Thinking burger for lunch.
[11:42:59] <BillCriswell> Just not in the mood to deal with a foot of snow.
[11:43:18] <decx> still snow?
[11:43:27] <decx> get with the times it's spring
[11:43:31] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[11:43:48] <BillCriswell> It snowed a lot yesterday night into very early this morning.
[11:44:36] <decx> we had a few days of subzero degrees (°c) all winter long
[11:44:47] <BillCriswell> That sounds miserable.
[11:45:23] <decx> that's
[11:45:28] <decx> 32°f
[11:45:38] <decx> damn f is confusing
[11:46:19] <BillCriswell> I assumed you meant F even thought you specifically said (c).
[11:47:27] <decx> i saw a person with a tshirt on the street today
[11:48:20] <decx> was a bit too optimistic with the nordic winds still breezing, i looked him straight in the eye and knew he thought. "i made a huge mistake"
[11:49:05] <andy_wfc> Can anyone tell me why jquery.submit() does not trigger the form's action here? as I read the documentation, it seems like it should. but in practice it does not. http://jsfiddle.net/YV9Xf/1/
[11:51:44] <decx> you've got 2 return falses on onclick attributes in your html
[11:51:56] <decx> that might have something to do with you submit returning false
[11:52:11] <decx> *r
[11:52:20] <NoiseEee> andy_wfc: also, watch for the form submit event, not the button click event.
[11:52:29] <andy_wfc> decx: docs say it still triggers the form's default action, or at least it sounds that way to me
[11:52:35] <NoiseEee> $('#loanform').on('submit',function() { //do stuff })
[11:52:39] <NoiseEee> andy_wfc: drop the inline BS.
[11:53:13] <NoiseEee> $('#loanform').on('submit',function(e) { confirmNewLoan(e); })
[11:53:34] <NoiseEee> where you can preventDefault on e (the event) if the confirmation 'fails'
[11:54:15] <andy_wfc> NoiseEee: I want to prevent text fields in the form from trigger a submit on enter. IME browser implementation of various keypress events for non-printable keys is an inconsistent disaster. that's why onsubmit is inlined
[11:54:56] <NoiseEee> andy_wfc: then i'll $('#yourForm').submit() and not require any validation
[11:55:28] <NoiseEee> andy_wfc: button type='button' will ensure forms don't submit with <enter>
[11:56:25] <andy_wfc> NoiseEee: nifty. I did not realize that
[11:56:42] <andy_wfc> that's a much cleaner solution
[11:56:49] <NoiseEee> word :)
[11:57:57] <BillCriswell> Just found a use for pointer-events: none, wo hoo!
[12:05:42] <decx> i've used it once, when i tried that technique applying it to body onscrollstart
[12:06:43] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to simulate shadows on the left and right side when I can scroll that way, but I needed the scroll events to happen on the div even when on the shadows.
[12:06:51] <BillCriswell> Well.. gradients.
[12:07:03] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/polif/4/edit
[12:07:15] <BillCriswell> Oops: http://jsbin.com/polif/7/edit
[12:08:29] <decx> i found that i get better performance from a 1px high png
[12:08:41] <decx> instead of background gradient
[12:09:11] <BillCriswell> decx: I do not doubt that at all.
[12:10:21] <BillCriswell> If I have something that's set in stone I'll make the PNG but people are too damn picky.
[12:10:40] <decx> it locks up when i drag the scrollbar from both ends
[12:11:06] <decx> ah because the gradiant is above the scrollbar maybe?
[12:11:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Is the point-events: none on the :before and :after elemeents in the link you're looking at?
[12:11:54] <BillCriswell> decx: I'm on OSX so I never see scroll bars lol
[12:12:55] <decx> yeah it's there
[12:13:24] <decx> when i drag the scrollbar it goes on until the left gradient is shown, then i have to regrab it
[12:13:34] <BillCriswell> decx: Ah.
[12:13:48] <BillCriswell> I guess I'd nee to detect the size of the scroll bar track.
[12:13:52] <decx> same when i drag from the right
[12:13:57] <hirsty> hey all
[12:14:27] <decx> is there a best practise to bind scrolldown/up to scroll left/right instead inside a container?
[12:14:34] <hirsty> am i doing anything wrong with this or is it just me? http://pastebin.com/4JscrgQH
[12:14:37] <ZeuZ> how can I do an AJAX request and be making a dialog that tells, for example, the percentage of the download done?
[12:14:52] <NoiseEee> ZeuZ: you cant
[12:15:01] <NoiseEee> downloading a file?
[12:15:22] <BillCriswell> decx: That would make it a lot easier, I was trying to avoid the extra element.
[12:15:22] <ZeuZ> NoiseEee, kinda what mega or such does
[12:15:24] * hirsty waves over to NoiseEee >.>
[12:16:35] <NoiseEee> hirsty: console.log(output) and see what it is... is it a JSON response, or a single word like "fail" ?
[12:17:04] <hirsty> POSTing to a php, echoing back pass or fail
[12:17:40] <NoiseEee> well i'd at least put it in a JSON response.   echo json_encode($myResponse['status'] = 'fail';);
[12:17:48] <NoiseEee> and then query output.status
[12:19:21] <decx> BillCriswell it's not actually pointer events none that blocks the dragging but the repaint for the new class
[12:21:04] <decx> probably because you're directly interacting with the overflow, because when i drag with pressed middle mousebutton it doesn'T lock
[12:25:50] <BillCriswell> decx: That stinks.
[12:49:25] <wh0ami> hi
[12:51:25] <wh0ami> anyone can say me how can i change all the row background color with jquery? for example i got <td class="tabletd" id="error1">blah</td><td class="tabletd" id="error1">asd</td>
[12:52:16] <wh0ami> trying http://jsfiddle.net/2TX6d/
[12:52:26] <NoiseEee> $(someTableRowReference).addClass('classWithABackgroundColorDefined')
[12:52:27] <wh0ami> but only works with the 1st cell of the row
[12:52:41] <ankurk> wh0ami: $('#tabletd').attr('bgcolor', "somecolor");
[12:53:00] <wh0ami> ankurk: i want do it by id not by class
[12:53:19] <ankurk> then give the id the selector
[12:53:22] <ankurk> *in
[12:53:27] <NoiseEee> wh0ami: if (this) is a <td>, then get the closest tr
[12:55:57] <wh0ami> .attr() not working
[12:57:24] <wh0ami> NoiseEee: want url and can check what i want to say?
[12:57:40] <exalt> hello is it possible to use jquery's $.post funtion to open the page in a new window or another tab ?
[12:57:45] <NoiseEee> wh0ami: what
[12:57:54] <mdev> I second exalts question
[12:57:57] <NoiseEee> wh0ami: you were right with your .css(),  don't use .attr()
[12:57:58] <monk3y> Folks, any know why the jQuery sortable 'stop' event might have ui.helper == null?  I've Googled and the only SO response I've found didn't really answer it.
[12:58:17] <NoiseEee> exalt: why wouldn't you just open a new page with that address?
[12:58:39] <NoiseEee> exalt: ie: sounds like you don't need XHR at all
[12:59:45] <exalt> NoiseEee: please excuse me.. im still not very witty with javascript..  i do want to open an new page, just in a new tab or window, 2nd what is XHR ?
[13:00:03] <NoiseEee> exalt: $.post is an ajax call. ajax = XHR.
[13:00:19] <exalt> maybe the question "what are you trying to accomplish" is better fit?
[13:01:37] <bashusr> is there any significance to .apply() ? I'm trying to figure out what return Backbone.sync.apply(this, arguments); in the backbone source means... Backbone.sync is defined as a function, but I don't know where they are getting .sync from
[13:01:41] <exalt> well im creating a entance webpage for my university... atm you have to login in every webservice indipendantly and they logout every 3 minutes or so, this is a pain for writing emails (just an example) ...
[13:01:47] <wh0ami> if i use .each as class= with # it works, but as id= with . it doesnt work, any idea?
[13:02:16] <wh0ami> $( "#error" + value ).each(function( index, element ) { = only work with the 1st of the row, if i use $( ".tabletd" + value ).each(function( index, element ) { works but for all table
[13:04:31] <NoiseEee> wh0ami: learn your selecotrs
[13:04:40] <NoiseEee> what is #error+value?  a <td> ?
[13:04:50] <NoiseEee> a single <td> ?
[13:05:08] <wh0ami> there is some <td>'s
[13:05:12] <NoiseEee> also, it also hints at you using IDs incorrectly / stuffing additional data into an id that could be better placed in a data-attribute
[13:06:13] <NoiseEee> wh0ami:   if you have a td, grab the closest <tr> and give a css property to all its found <td>s
[13:06:18] <wh0ami> $("td#error" + value).each(function() {
[13:06:21] <wh0ami> worked with that
[13:06:34] <NoiseEee> surely you only have a single td with that ID though
[13:06:41] <NoiseEee> so why are you .each()-ing anything?
[13:08:09] <wh0ami> just $("td#error" + value).css("background-color", "#F00"); worked too, without each Oo'
[13:08:29] <wh0ami> thank u
[13:09:18] <nezZario> what's the proper way to define new functions?
[13:09:26] <nezZario> is there a naming scheme or something?
[13:09:31] <nezZario> just any conventions to follow?
[13:13:05] <hadees> So I know I can change jQuery.fn.ready to a custom wrapper so I can log to airbrake but can I  do that with other events? For example "page:load" which comes from turbo links?
[13:13:43] <hadees> this is what I mean if you don't understand http://pastie.org/8734459
[13:22:20] <CrazyZurfer> hey guys... when I've loaded something to the page (DOM) the $(tag).on('click', function(){alert('aaah')}); doesn't work.. I guess it's because in dom.. how Can i manipulate dom?
[13:22:46] <duch_kazatel> CrazyZurfer you ARE "manipulating the dom"
[13:23:04] <CrazyZurfer> duch_kazatel: yes.. so? :)
[13:23:17] <duch_kazatel> CrazyZurfer look into the event delegation syntax of .on() - $('parent').on('click', 'child', function (){});
[13:24:33] <duch_kazatel> CrazyZurfer be aware that the page is all "in the dom"/.
[13:24:52] <CrazyZurfer> thanks.. I'll look into that

[13:40:19] <BillCriswell> skypce: No problem.
[13:43:43] <duch_kazatel> yes, very thank you BillCriswell
[13:43:45] <duch_kazatel> very

[13:46:24] <ravenzz> I was wonder how easy could be to write a very minimal and simple modules loader with jQuery (something like requirejs)
[13:46:26] <BillCriswell> skypce: http://jsbin.com/ciqib/2/edit Yeah, this second version I sent does that I think.
[13:46:49] <skypce> BillCriswell,  very very thank you
[13:47:17] <BillCriswell> It also triggers the first one automatically.
[14:16:57] <JMyers> Hi! Newbie here, anyone know where on JQuery.com I can download the .vsdoc.js files?
[14:19:11] <BillCriswell> JMyers: Not sure what that is.
[14:19:38] <Guest12863> hi guys : )
[14:20:23] <JMyers> Hi, Bill..It's the JavaScript file for Intellisense on Visual Studio..Running VS2008
[14:22:46] <JMyers> Anyone from JQuery.Foundation online?
[14:23:14] <tw2113> why would jquery.com host Intellisense files?
[14:24:22] <duch_kazatel> query foundation?
[14:24:45] <DarkStompy> IE8 problem (I know that we all love IE). The first time I load a page it jQuery does not load and run but after reloading the page it runs fine. What is causing it?
[14:24:53] <mortal1> I would like to redirect to another page, and once there click a link specified by the previous page
[14:25:08] <mortal1> perhaps I could store a selector in a url parm?
[14:25:11] <duch_kazatel> mortal1 are you in control of the page the user lands on?
[14:25:19] <mortal1> duch_kazatel: yeah
[14:25:23] <BillCriswell> Oh lol.
[14:25:27] <BillCriswell> Was going to say.
[14:25:37] <duch_kazatel> mortal1 you could do that, or store a variable server-side.
[14:25:52] <duch_kazatel> ALSO: HI I MAY HAVE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK WHILE AT WORK.
[14:26:12] <mortal1> duch_kazatel: it's five oclock somewhere
[14:26:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Niiice.
[14:27:11] <tw2113> don't drive duch_kazatel
[14:27:36] <mortal1> hopefully he takes public transportation, he'll blend right in lol
[14:28:00] <duch_kazatel> nope, I never drive when I've been drinking.
[14:28:05] <duch_kazatel> it's not very much.
[14:28:12] <duch_kazatel> but juuust enough that I'm like "hay guize"
[14:28:44] * mortal1 is an "Ilovyouguys" guy
[14:29:54] <andy_wfc> Ugh, to resurrect an earlier conversation, pressing enter in a text input on a form that DOES NOT have a submit button shouldn't submit the form, right? I had a working solution a couple hours ago and now the browser behavior seems different
[14:33:32] <duch_kazatel> andy_wfc no clue.  you might have to prevent the submit event.
[14:34:27] <andy_wfc> duch_kazatel: at this point, this is *literally* the entire page and pressing enter submits it.
[14:34:28] <andy_wfc> http://pastebin.com/rP0033Tc
[14:34:49] <duch_kazatel> sounds about right.
[14:35:17] <duch_kazatel> enter = submitting the form.
[14:35:19] <andy_wfc> all my other forms that do not have submit buttons won't submit on an enter key press
[14:36:16] <duch_kazatel> that form has an action and a method
[14:37:14] <duch_kazatel> and you've got a plain text input.  without prevent the default action, that seems right.
[14:37:46] <andy_wfc> Yes, i realize that. The problem I'm trying to solve is on a page with three forms. All three have actions and methods. None of them have onsubmit code or any kind of javascript. None have submit buttons. Form #1 does not submit on enter. Form #2 does not submit on enter. Form #3 does submit on enter. The inconsistency makes no sense
[14:38:32] <duch_kazatel> without seend all of the code, it's hard to know.
[14:38:41] <duch_kazatel> *seeing
[14:38:54] <andy_wfc> yeah, i know
[14:50:05] <Guest12863> hi guys
[14:50:09] <Guest12863> :)
[14:50:22] <duch_kazatel> what if everybody here was female?  HUH?
[14:50:28] <duch_kazatel> then you'd feel like a sexist pig.
[14:50:32] <duch_kazatel> j/k whuddup
[14:51:33] <Guest12863> duch_kazatel valentine's day fever , i see : )
[14:54:17] <Guest12863> i have a question about loading pictures on a website
[14:54:52] <Guest12863> and about this  jquery gallery : http://www.jqueryscript.net/gallery/Fast-Performing-Photo-Gallery-Plugin-Galleriffic.html
[14:55:45] <Guest12863> galleriffic: A jQuery plugin for rendering fast-performing photo galleries
[14:56:16] <Guest12863> how are photographs loaded on to this gallery ?
[14:56:31] <Guest12863> have a look at this : https://code.google.com/p/galleriffic/source/browse/trunk/example/example-1.html
[14:57:00] <Guest12863> can you guys see this line : <a class="thumb" href=" http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3261/2538183196_8baf9a8015.jpg
[14:57:01] <andy_wfc> duch_kazatel: I think I found my problem. If a form has no submit button and EXACTLY one text input, enter submits the form. If it has more text inputs, it does not. No clue who thought that was useful behavior
[14:57:21] <duch_kazatel> andy_wfc I would guess the type of input is important.
[14:57:58] <andy_wfc> doesn't seem to be. one text input, submits, two or more text inputs, does not. literally no other elements within the form
[14:58:57] <Guest12863> the question is :can i upload pictures of flikr on to this jquery gallery ?
[14:59:47] <Guest12863> how to create this kind of a flikr page? : farm4.static.flickr.com/YOURnameUSER/....
[15:00:13] <duch_kazatel> Guest12863 you cannot create user accounts on flicker through the plugin if that's what you're asking.
[15:00:25] <duch_kazatel> but you might be able to extend it to use flickr instead.
[15:01:05] <Guest12863> duch_kazatel : i dont want to create user account THROUGH the plugin
[15:01:19] <Guest12863> i want to upload pictures to flikr
[15:01:48] <Guest12863> and i want that the gallery will use those pictures from the server of flickr , SO they can load faster...
[15:03:14] <Guest12863> duch_kazatel  look at this code again :https://code.google.com/p/galleriffic/source/browse/trunk/example/example-1.html
[15:04:21] <Guest12863> duch_kazatel can you see the part of the code where the pictures are loaded FROM flikr
[15:06:26] <Guest12863> duch_kazatel :  look at this demo  , and look at the source code ,the pictures shown here ARE LOADED FROM flikr: http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/Fast-Performing-Photo-Gallery-Plugin-Galleriffic/
[15:08:34] <duch_kazatel> lol woah i'm at work broseph.
[15:08:37] <duch_kazatel> chill.
[15:09:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah looks like they're just using flickr image sources.
[15:12:52] <Guest12863> yes...
[15:13:33] <Guest12863> how do i do that ,i mean make a link like that to the pictures on flikr
[15:19:20] <asido> I have my object wrapped into `$(function (App, $, undefined) { }(window.App = window.App || {}, jQuery));` and it gets called before anything is being seen on the screen, meaning all the selectors fail. I assume it's the state when the document isn't yet ready, right?
[15:19:20] <duch_kazatel> by using image sources from flicker.
[15:19:23] <duch_kazatel> *flickr
[15:25:42] <motaka2> When someone submits a form I want some to replace text input values with some other values. when I do this in submit event the  new text input value is first changed and is shown to the user which I don't want and after some seconds the page disapears for the new page. How can I prevent showing the value before the current page is vanished?
[15:35:03] <motaka2> no one ?
[15:35:33] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you'll have to like serialize your data and edit/submit that instead
[15:36:53] <specious> motaka2: you could have hidden inputs that shadow the visible inputs?
[15:37:25] <motaka2> specious: That is my plan B, I hoped I wouldnt have to use that plan cause i'll be ugly
[15:37:43] <specious> motaka2: :)
[15:37:55] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 submit grabs the values at the time of submit - there's no way you can get away without doing it.
[15:37:59] <motaka2> specious: :) why do u smile?
[15:38:16] <specious> motaka2: because I agree with your assessment
[15:39:16] <motaka2> specious: I thought it had something to do with plan B. I am smiling myslef cause I rembered stupid action movies changing from plan A to B
[15:40:06] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I know I want submit to do the job I just dont want to show the fake values to the user while submit moves the page
[16:04:06] <shennyg> Is there a class that identifies whether of not a jQuery Mobile dropdown has been selected or not?
[16:04:20] <shennyg> I'd like to style unselected and selected differently.
[16:13:05] <tw2113> is there a way I could reference the contents of a variable as a property?
[16:13:11] <tw2113> as an example: http://jsbin.com/rewax/1/edit
[16:13:37] <tw2113> instea of the if part, could i somehow dynamically match the contents of shortcode with the badgeos_achievements_list part property name
[16:14:46] <tw2113> i'd like to be able to not hardcode the comparison in the if () part because I don't always know what will be coming in in the shortcode variable
[16:17:45] <tw2113> makes me wish badgeos_shortcodes.shortcode would work, but that would be interpreted as the actual property
[16:19:55] <motaka2> after a submit button clicked I change the val of some text inputs but I dont want to show those values to the uses until the page moves to the new page. Is there a solution ?
[16:32:21] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 no.
[16:35:55] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I am creating an auto complete I need to show one value but post another value. What's the best solutiom
[16:36:38] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 serialize the array, modify and post the serialized version.
[16:36:56] <duch_kazatel> something along those lines.
[16:37:11] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: in tha case I have to use ajax ?
[16:37:16] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 yes.
[16:37:29] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: No I cant use ajax
[16:37:34] <duch_kazatel> or do some gymnastics with a hidden form.
[16:38:18] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: how does jquery ui auto complete does that ?
[16:38:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:40:03] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: jquery UI has autocomplete , how do they do that without relying on ajax or what
[16:40:38] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 why not read the source code?
[16:40:57] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I am not that pro to understand jquery UI
[16:41:19] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 if you want their autocomplete widget, why not just use it?
[16:41:40] <motaka2> No I cant use it I am asking how they do it
[16:43:17] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet they do something like start with an array of values and, on every keystroke, compare the current string against those values, writing all valid matches to a special dropdown coitnainer.
[16:43:21] <duch_kazatel> *container
[16:44:06] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I didnt get anything
[16:44:47] <tw2113> oh hey, i think i found my solution
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 not sure what to tell you, then..
[16:45:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: ok
[16:45:55] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 what do you need to help you understand at this point?
[16:46:31] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: i DONT KNOW. i THINK i DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR ENGLISH
[16:46:48] <motaka2> sorry
[16:47:09] <duch_kazatel> okay, so start from the beginning.  they have an array of valid options, right?
[16:47:57] <Sal> are all values returned by jquery strings?
[16:48:04] <motaka2> right
[16:48:07] <duch_kazatel> Sal not sure what you mean.  not normally.
[16:48:31] <Sal> i'm getting a lot of calcs messed because of strings calcutaed with numbers
[16:48:41] <duch_kazatel> Sal huh?  have an example?
[16:49:03] <Sal> so i was wondering if values returns by a query were all returned as strings (like sql does) or even as numbers
[16:49:14] <Sal> returns=returned
[16:49:25] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 so for every keystroke, check for the current string in the array of valid options.
[16:49:31] <duch_kazatel> sal, what queries?
[16:49:36] <Sal> like $('.el').width()
[16:49:45] <duch_kazatel> that's returned as a number,
[16:49:48] <Sal> does that return "100" or 100
[16:50:04] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: What do u mean by keystroke ?
[16:50:11] <Sal> like $('.el').attr('left')
[16:50:13] <Sal> and that?
[16:50:19] <duch_kazatel> Sal that'll return a string.
[16:50:24] <Sal> damn
[16:50:24] <duch_kazatel> if there's a "left" attribute.
[16:50:33] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 a keypress?
[16:51:02] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: and ?
[16:51:10] <Sal> so, if it has something to do with css, its always a string?
[16:51:12] <Sal> is that it?
[16:51:28] <duch_kazatel> sal .attr() isn't checking css...
[16:51:48] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 every time the user enters a letter, check to see what items in the array contain the current string
[16:52:09] <motaka2> and?
[16:52:50] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 then write those values into an element that shows under the search box.
[16:52:53] <duch_kazatel> done.
[16:53:11] <Sal> so $('.el').css('width') returns a string while $('.el').width() returns a number ?
[16:53:14] <Sal> right?
[16:53:27] <duch_kazatel> Sal correct.  https://api.jquery.com/width/ for more info.
[16:53:34] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: thx. I don't get it but thanks.
[16:53:40] <Sal> ok, thanks
[16:53:52] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 you should really learn javascript and jquery then :)
[16:53:55] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty simple
[16:54:20] <motaka2> duch_kazatel: I know js and jquery to some oint
[16:54:24] <motaka2> point*
[16:54:41] <motaka2> I dont know how your solution solve my problem
[16:56:06] <BillCriswell> I need something to build.
[16:57:50] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 explain what your problem actually is, then, because you're asking about how jqueryUI's autocomplete works/.
[17:05:05] <jokeyrhyme> anyone responsible for bugs.jquery.com available?
[17:05:19] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ jokeyrhyme
[17:05:19] <b-ot> jokeyrhyme: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:05:58] <jokeyrhyme> okay, sorry. :( i'm having an issue getting my password reset at bugs.jquery.com
[17:06:09] <jokeyrhyme> same username as my irc nickname: jokeyrhyme
[17:06:16] <jokeyrhyme> it's been 10 minutes and still no email
[17:06:27] <jokeyrhyme> i've checked my spam folders
[17:06:31] <toothrot> that's not very long
[17:06:42] <duch_kazatel> yeah 10 minutes isn't much.
[17:06:49] <toothrot> i know it usually shows up right away
[17:07:14] <toothrot> but i had a similar deal on a different site take a few hours the other week
[17:07:29] <jokeyrhyme> sorry for being impatient. i'll just wait longer then. :)
[17:10:14] <jokeyrhyme> oh, the issue i was going to report... i may as well discuss it here then :
[17:10:16] <jokeyrhyme> :)
[17:10:23] <jokeyrhyme> i'm playing with custom jquery builds
[17:11:07] <jokeyrhyme> anyone else notice that `grunt custom:-ajax` gives smaller output than `grunt custom:-core/ready,-ajax,-effects,-deferred` ??
[17:11:36] <jokeyrhyme> this is for both 1.11.0 and 2.1.0 tags
[17:27:36] <BillCriswell> Whenever I try to use Bower something doesn't work right.
[17:35:54] <Oog> $(document).ready(function() { is efter all js has loaded right? im getting tinymce not defined sometimes - pretty sure its a timing issue
[17:36:07] <duch_kazatel> no, it's after the document is ready.
[17:36:12] <duch_kazatel> that may or may not include other javascrip.t
[17:36:31] <Oog> i see - fix?
[17:36:57] <duch_kazatel> make sure your script is after everything else and use callbacks where appropriate,.
[17:38:48] <nahtnam> Hey! I need some help. Im not sure if this falls in css or JS, but basically I set width to 100% and I want the height to equal the width
[17:38:54] <nahtnam> so it would be a square
[17:39:57] <duch_kazatel> do it with JS
[17:43:10] <Oog> "By definition the document.ready executes once the DOM has loaded. The <script> element is part of the DOM. When the browser encounters a <script> tag it stops parsing the page and downloads and executes the script before continuing on the next element. So inside the document.ready event all scripts (that were part of the DOM in <script> tags) will be loaded."
[17:43:15] <Oog> is hat right?
[17:43:20] <Oog> cant be right
[17:57:42] <Velveeta> oog: yes, that's right
[17:57:58] <Oog> then how can .ready fire and not all scripts be loaded?
[17:58:45] <Oog> duch_kazatel said .ready is after document ready which may not include scripts - and that is what im seeing in practice
[17:59:00] <Oog> but this stackoverflow post says otherwise
[17:59:03] <Velveeta> that could happen if you're not loading your scripts in script tags, if you're loading them asyncronously
[17:59:07] <Oog> is there a different ready?
[17:59:17] <Velveeta> there's only .ready that i'm aware of
[17:59:44] <Oog> <script src...> loading tinymce appear before my <script> with .ready() that calls tinyMCE yet sometimes i get error
[18:00:15] <Velveeta> is there a url i can see that in action?
[18:00:57] <Velveeta> i do know that depending on how you're loading tinymce, uses iframes to load itself in
[18:01:07] <Velveeta> and asynchronous loading of its scripts
[18:01:41] <Oog> i fixed it by moving tinymce js into head
[18:01:44] <Oog> that seems to fix it
[18:01:54] <Oog> i cant easily show the other code right now in a working site
[18:02:05] <Velveeta> ok
[18:02:09] <Oog> its mixed in rails and local dev right now
[18:02:25] <Oog> but in theory .ready does get called after all script tags load and execute?
[18:03:39] <Velveeta> it absolutely does get called after all script tags are loaded, yes
[18:04:01] <Oog> ok thanks some funky tinymce stuff i guess
[18:05:33] <FriendlySeal> hay gaize
[18:05:36] <FriendlySeal> o/
[18:05:43] <FriendlySeal> Friendly is hear
[18:29:33] <NBhosting> how can i speed this up on alot of divs, like 1500
[18:29:35] <NBhosting> https://dpaste.de/QDpi
[18:29:54] <NBhosting> this runs every 2 seconds and u notice it working when scrolling
[19:05:06] <BillCriswell> NBhosting: Not sure how much quicker it would be but you don't need to do document.getElementById(this.id), this is already the message.
[19:06:26] <BillCriswell> NBhosting: http://pastie.org/pastes/8735158/text like this.
[19:49:45] <davistv> Anyone got a second?  I'm working on a bug with ie9, it has something to do with it not sustaining a hover state over an li element, not sure why. Using a pretty standard slideUp / slideDown approach, works in Safari and Chrome fine.
[19:59:05] <pom_life> Hellloooo~
[19:59:58] <jamto11> does anyone know of a good free mac tool where i can get the hexadecimal color of an image (i want to use that color on my website)?
[20:01:07] <pom_life> Do macs not come with a paint-like program by default equipped with a color picker?
[20:02:25] <jamto11> i have no idea :( the default to open a jpg is preview
[20:03:04] <pom_life> Huh. Well, let's get to Google!
[20:06:18] <pom_life> Have you searched the app store for just 'paint'?
[20:07:30] <diegoviola> hi
[20:07:41] <pom_life> hello
[20:07:41] <diegoviola> i'm trying to make some div appear/reappear, this is my code: $('#add_comment_link').click(function() { var content = $('#notes_container'); if (content.css('display') == 'none') { content.show(); } else { content.hide(); } });
[20:08:10] <diegoviola> i'm trying to toggle that function with an anchor element
[20:08:37] <diegoviola> <a href="#" id="add_comment_link">add new comment</a>
[20:08:41] <tw2113> $('#add_comment_link').click(function() { $(this).toggleClass('hideme'); });
[20:08:46] <diegoviola> what i'm doing wrong?
[20:08:48] <diegoviola> thanks
[20:08:55] <tw2113> .hideme { display: none; }
[20:09:37] <pom_life> tw2113: Got a question for you as a fellow dev.
[20:09:39] <tw2113> first click adds it, causing the display: none; second click removes the class, setting the display back to normal
[20:09:49] <acidjazz> FELLOW DEV
[20:09:50] <acidjazz> MY DEVS
[20:09:52] <acidjazz> MY FELLOWS
[20:09:57] <tw2113> oh captain my captain?
[20:10:00] <acidjazz> FLOCK TO ME MY DEV FELLOWS LET US RIDE
[20:10:06] * tw2113 gives acidjazz his ear
[20:10:14] <acidjazz> YOU HAVE MY AXE
[20:10:15] <tw2113> sorry for the earwax build up
[20:10:15] <pom_life> tw2113: Do you ever get the feeling that something you're spending time on is a waste because there's already some sort of plugin that exists?
[20:10:21] <diegoviola> tw2113: doesn't seem to work
[20:10:33] <tw2113> pom_life, nope
[20:10:37] <acidjazz> pom_life: always look first
[20:11:06] <acidjazz> 1. look first, 2. review any existing, 3. decide upon their use compared to making your own
[20:11:08] <pom_life> Like, as it is I'm familiar with basic javascrip and jquery. I don't even know where to BEGIN when it comes to other frameworks/libraries, though?
[20:11:19] <tw2113> the beginning
[20:11:23] <acidjazz> pom_life: node.js
[20:11:30] <systemfault> pom_life: It depends on what you need/want to do.
[20:11:36] <tw2113> Step 1: installation instructions
[20:11:49] <pom_life> You'd recommend node upfront? And then moveon to like backbone/underscore?
[20:12:14] <pom_life> What I "need/want" to do is build useful skills before I start school. Skills that will help me regardless of where I end up dev-career-wise.
[20:12:14] <tw2113> i don't need to be a node expert to get going with grunt
[20:12:20] <pom_life> AKA, very general expactations
[20:12:23] <tw2113> but knowing how to debug helps
[20:12:30] <tw2113> that said, i don't know how to debug node
[20:12:40] <acidjazz> pom_life: well if you want to stay w/ js yes
[20:12:42] <tw2113> i feel massive success when i get basic grunt stuff to work
[20:12:53] <acidjazz> its a step in learning back-end while not having to learn a language
[20:12:57] <acidjazz> otherwise id say PHP is an easy step
[20:12:57] <diegoviola> any ideas
[20:12:58] <tw2113> $('#add_comment_link').on('click',function(){ $(this).toggleClass('hideme'); });
[20:13:04] <pom_life> I "know" PHP.
[20:13:12] <acidjazz> and dont start w/ a framework yet.. start raw so you understand
[20:13:21] <pom_life> *know as in, I know the basics and have done a few projectd with it, not like a deep understanding
[20:13:30] <tw2113> fundamentals are always good foundations
[20:13:33] <pom_life> but what about ajax/json? If using a lot of JS, aren't those preferable?
[20:13:35] <acidjazz> meh.. w/ php you can mainly guess and google everything
[20:14:02] <acidjazz> there's js2php and php2js which are very helpful for seeing how another langauges handles something
[20:14:03] <tw2113> json is pretty straightforward and couples closely enough with js/jquery to learn at the same time
[20:14:09] <pom_life> Also: I'm familiar with PHP, Ruby, Python & C# for backend. Aren't those backend languages?
[20:14:16] <acidjazz> yes
[20:14:16] <pom_life> not php
[20:14:18] <pom_life> thats serverside
[20:14:25] <acidjazz> backend == serverside
[20:14:27] <tw2113> backend...serverside...
[20:14:28] <pom_life> well, backend IS serverside
[20:14:29] <pom_life> LOL
[20:14:30] <acidjazz> dealing w/ a db/etc
[20:14:57] <acidjazz> i use mainly PHP for backend because its old, very old, meaning its very stable and has the most support
[20:15:04] <pom_life> What is the most common way to take a php sql db object and set JS vars to values in that DB?
[20:15:11] <pom_life> Is there some JS /. PHP cross-framework?
[20:15:14] <acidjazz> but these days im having fun w/ it.. using node tools like jade and stylus give me js on the back end w/ php
[20:15:18] <tw2113> set js vars?
[20:15:26] <acidjazz> pom_life: thats where id say maybe go a nosql route.. like mongodb
[20:15:33] <acidjazz> pom_life: mongo command line is javascript
[20:15:38] <pom_life> Of which I know 0. These are the tough questions
[20:15:40] <pom_life> lol
[20:15:49] <acidjazz> pom_life: otherwise i have a mysql AR library i use which does query <-> object
[20:16:32] <pom_life> Let's say I have a "user page". The user logs in (which I handle through PHP). Then, I adjust variables in real time with js. Once done, I want to update the db again with PHP. Passing the new JS/JQ vars to PHP that way is possible somehow, right?
[20:17:00] <tw2113> wouldn't that be fully handled by ajax?
[20:17:08] <tw2113> or at least could be
[20:17:21] <pom_life> I get mixed up between AJAX and JSON
[20:17:36] <tw2113> ajax is capable of dealing with json
[20:17:42] <tw2113> they're different things though
[20:18:08] <pom_life> AJAX is what the XMLHTTPRequest object exists within, right?
[20:18:27] <acidjazz> tw2113: ajax is preferred
[20:18:37] <systemfault> pom_life: Nah.. AJAX is a stupid term invented by some dudes 10 years ago
[20:18:40] <acidjazz> yes XMLHTTPREQUEST is the proper name
[20:18:43] <tw2113> preferred compared to what?
[20:18:48] <acidjazz> ajax = marketing term
[20:18:57] <jphase> lol?
[20:19:06] <systemfault> pom_life: The browser contains an HTTP client... It's called XMLHttpRequest
[20:19:12] <jphase> if you're talking about the sink cleaning compounds, then sure
[20:19:33] <systemfault> pom_life: WIth it, you can load data asynchronously from a server... it can be text/xml... and more recently, binaries.
[20:19:36] <pom_life> Okay. I know XMLHTTPRequest queries the server for a file. What's the opposite of XMLHTTPREQUEST? Taking a javascript var and putting it on the server?
[20:19:43] <pom_life> I'm probably asking the wrong questions. :|
[20:19:50] <systemfault> pom_life: You can send data using a request.
[20:20:12] <acidjazz> but youll need a page refresh
[20:20:15] <systemfault> pom_life: You have access to all the HTTP VERBS/HEADERS with XHR
[20:21:41] <pom_life> Who here is (very) familiar with canvas?
[20:21:56] <tw2113> boy you're bouncing around topics a lot
[20:22:26] <pom_life> I'm just now dipping my toes into the pool of advanced web development. You can't blame me for getting excited :]
[20:22:42] <systemfault> pom_life: You should learn one thing at a time.
[20:22:52] <tw2113> no wonder you're confused about everything
[20:22:54] <pom_life> But then I'd just get bored :/
[20:22:58] <systemfault> Haha :)
[20:23:01] <pom_life> I'm not confused about *everything*
[20:23:13] <tw2113> ok fine, you know how babies are created
[20:23:14] <diegoviola> i have a div i'm trying to hide/unhide with this code: $('#showhide').click(function() { $(this).toggleClass('hideme'); }); -- i'm trying to toggle it with an anchor like this: <a id="showhide">toggle</a> but it's not working, any ideas what i'm missing?
[20:23:26] <pom_life> The way I work is by learning new concepts and building small one-off projects while incorporating what I've learned.
[20:23:39] <tw2113> did you actually add the class to your stylesheet and do something with it diegoviola ?
[20:23:48] <tw2113> did you confirm that it actually gets the class added to it?
[20:24:27] <tw2113> pom_life, you risk being given a screwdriver, and a pile of plywood, and told to make a small bookshelf
[20:24:34] <diegoviola> tw2113: i have a <style> on the same document where i have the div with display: none; yes
[20:24:48] <pom_life> I don't catch the analogy.
[20:24:59] <tw2113> you don't necesssarily have the right tools to get the job done
[20:25:08] <tw2113> and not knowing what a screwdriver is for?you risk wasting time
[20:25:24] <tw2113> when what you need is a saw and whatnot
[20:25:38] <tw2113> diegoviola, did you confirm the class is added?
[20:25:54] <tw2113> did you check your js console for errors
[20:26:20] <pom_life> Okay. But look at it this way. I know some people who don't know shit about JavaScript, and focused entirely on jQuery. They can work wqith jQuery, sure, but because they never messed around with pure JS they can't really know the inner workings of jQuery, can they?
[20:26:31] <tw2113> nope
[20:26:36] <pom_life> maybe 'wasting time' is learning about what libraries do and how they save time
[20:26:49] <tw2113> and that doesn't apply to you asking about ajax, json, XDERE##$WTRSF and then canvas
[20:26:52] <script_> how can you work with jQuery and don't know Javascript ?!
[20:26:57] <diegoviola> tw2113: i see nothing in the console
[20:27:01] <diegoviola> tw2113: yes, the class gets added
[20:27:02] <pom_life> easily
[20:27:12] <script_> I don't think so
[20:27:24] <script_> jquery is javascript library
[20:27:25] <pom_life> okay take someone who wants to click a div and make it disappear
[20:27:28] <tw2113> diegoviola, live link one could peak at?
[20:27:33] <pom_life> all they need to know is a simple code snippet
[20:27:34] <systemfault> script_ By copy/pasting stuff found on the interwebz and by asking questions on SO
[20:27:50] <pom_life> $('#div').click(function(){ $(this).fadeOut('fast'); });
[20:27:51] <script_> :)
[20:28:00] <pom_life> They don't "know" any js
[20:28:02] <pom_life> they just copy pasted
[20:28:49] <diegoviola> tw2113: one sec
[20:29:33] <pom_life> When jQuery uses .fadeOut, is it just using a function that adjusts the opacity at a certain rate until the opacity is 0%, then sets the display to 'none'? Is that how jQuery animations are programmed?
[20:30:32] <systemfault> pom_life: Yes, it's exactly that
[20:30:48] <systemfault> pom_life: The "good old way" of doing animations.. using timers
[20:31:23] <pom_life> That's the thing about programming man.
[20:31:29] <pom_life> It's so f***ing logical.
[20:31:42] <pom_life> If there's a problem, you can break it down into tiny pieces, and solve the first one.
[20:33:23] <tw2113> if there's a problem, yo i'll solve it, check out the beats while the dj revolves it
[20:33:53] <pom_life> I'm sorry, I wasn't aware this was #References
[20:34:07] <tw2113> don't mind me and Vanilla Ice
[20:35:18] <prbc> wich is the best slideshow in your opinion?
[20:35:42] <jphase> lol
[20:36:01] <pom_life> that could not be more vague
[20:36:01] <jphase> Slider Revolution is pretty epic imo - just started using it for a new site
[20:36:21] <Kal_crunchbang> how would i scroll a uses page down so they can see div id #content
[20:36:58] <jphase> Kal_crunchbang: jQuery
[20:37:02] <pom_life> refresh the page with url #div?
[20:37:06] <tw2113> ditch sliders for usability and pleasing your clients' visitors
[20:37:11] <pom_life> www.somesite.com/#div
[20:37:17] <Kal_crunchbang> yes but how??
[20:37:31] <Kal_crunchbang> its for 3ds
[20:37:55] <Kal_crunchbang> is there a way without reloading
[20:38:15] <jphase> $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $('#div').offset().top }, 1000);
[20:38:20] <jphase> or something of the sort
[20:38:22] <pom_life> there are ways, but i'd think you'd need to adjust your sites design accordionly
[20:38:44] <Kal_crunchbang> great i will give that ago
[20:39:13] <FriendlySeal> lol
[20:39:13] <jphase> and don't listen to my slider comment, I thought I was talking in a different channel :x
[20:39:20] <FriendlySeal> u mean like this
[20:39:23] <FriendlySeal> upldz.com
[20:39:25] <FriendlySeal> kekeke
[20:39:39] <tw2113> jphase, don't be bringing your slider stuff into #wordpress
[20:39:43] <tw2113> i'll look to have you kicked
[20:39:51] <jphase> lol, say wha?
[20:39:56] <FriendlySeal> # is a hash
[20:40:10] <FriendlySeal> its programed to be escaped
[20:40:13] <Kal_crunchbang> works realy nicely thanks jphase
[20:40:29] <FriendlySeal> wich is why its used for dynamic navigation
[20:41:38] <jphase> tw2113: sorry to get on your bad side, thought someone was asking for a plugin recommendation for a slider. There are few plugins in general that I recommend.
[20:41:47] <jphase> anti-slider is a design choice
[20:42:18] <tw2113> :P
[20:42:31] <FriendlySeal> wow u sound ignorant
[20:42:33] <FriendlySeal> lool
[20:42:43] <tw2113> at least i have to try
[20:42:55] <FriendlySeal> anyhow u giaze will never be as leet as me
[20:43:00] <jphase> FriendlySeal: no one cares about your opinion, go back to 14 y/o land lol
[20:43:01] <tw2113> thank god
[20:43:05] <FriendlySeal> std::endl
[20:43:23] <pom_life> Did you guys know that to " 'fess up " is short for confess?
[20:43:33] <diegoviola> tw2113: it's working now with this code: https://gist.github.com/diegoviola/d1caafe5f889b64a6934
[20:43:35] <jphase> makes sense
[20:43:40] <diegoviola> but how do i make the content hide by default?
[20:43:45] <tw2113> did you know that my foot is aliased to your ass?
[20:43:47] <pom_life> display: none?
[20:43:49] <tw2113> </redforeman>
[20:43:55] <FriendlySeal> .hide()
[20:43:56] <diegoviola> for that it's enough to just reference content to display: none class no?
[20:44:12] <tw2113> diegoviola, have the class on from the start
[20:44:13] <FriendlySeal> $(el).hide();
[20:44:21] <FriendlySeal> diegoviola,
[20:44:22] <tw2113> the first click would remove the class, thus showing it
[20:44:22] <FriendlySeal> also
[20:44:27] <tw2113> the 2nd click would hide it again
[20:44:35] <FriendlySeal> make a css rule .hide { display:none;}
[20:44:44] <FriendlySeal> then u go class="hide"
[20:44:51] <Kal_crunchbang> jphase it has no slider it is made for dsi and 3ds
[20:44:59] <diegoviola> tw2113: so <div id="content" class="hideme"> ?
[20:45:04] <tw2113> yes diegoviola
[20:45:05] <jphase> Kal_crunchbang: nvm my slider comment
[20:45:10] <diegoviola> tw2113: ok thanks
[20:45:14] <Kal_crunchbang> ok
[20:45:28] <FriendlySeal> class="content hide"
[20:45:43] <FriendlySeal> try to use id= only wen uve thot it thru
[20:45:48] <systemfault> FriendlySeal.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max());
[20:45:54] <diegoviola> ok thanks
[20:46:03] <jphase> alright, am I silly to assume that     $('a[href^="' + document.URL + '/#"]')  would not work for anything that has current domain URL with a hash on the end?
[20:46:28] <FriendlySeal> systemfault, ignore what bitch
[20:46:33] <FriendlySeal> fkn faget
[20:46:50] <jphase> FriendlySeal: if you're going to be offensive, learn to spell

[20:48:28] <FriendlySeal> hmmm
[20:48:41] <FriendlySeal> im the ugly one here?
[20:48:46] <FriendlySeal> r u sure
[20:49:01] * jphase ignores FriendlySeal
[20:49:01] <FriendlySeal> last time i checked real life it wasnt so
[20:49:09] <jphase> ahhhh, much better :D
[20:49:18] <FriendlySeal> ya thats rite stfu u fkn buttgoof
[20:49:33] <jphase> $('a[href^="' + document.URL + '/#"]')  <- this not looking like it should work the way I'm expecting?

[20:53:17] <jphase> I mean, I'd prefer not to use a wildcard selector like *=
[20:53:25] <jphase> well, I guess ^= is still wildcard
[20:53:37] <systemfault> jphase: Perhaps $= would be better for you
[20:53:47] <systemfault> Not sure though.
[20:54:00] <jphase> hmm, well I want it to not "end with something" but more be like "start with something"
[20:54:08] <jphase> idk
[20:54:13] <jphase> I'm open to schooling
[20:54:26] <FriendlySeal> hahaha
[20:54:37] <FriendlySeal> ya help this nub systemfault

[20:55:34] <jphase> hi
[20:55:40] <script_> hi
[20:55:44] <Vivekananda> so I guess I am back to looking if I can solve it here
[20:56:01] <systemfault> jphase: At this point, I don't know if it would be better for you to just select all  <a> then use .filter
[20:56:49] <jphase> systemfault: agreed. I just figured this would be possible with a selector no? seems like it *should* make sense but I just can't get it to trigger.
[20:57:25] <systemfault> jphase: To be honest, I can't even imagine why you want to do this
[20:57:48] <jphase> systemfault: it's a one-page layout that uses wordpressy navigation stuffs to scroll to various elements on the page
[20:58:01] <jphase> so it will start with like http://mydomain.com/#
[20:58:18] <jphase> (so it works on pages that are not within the one-page layout)
[20:59:47] <jphase> while on the home page, I want all the links to animate to the element within the hash - which works fine with something like $('a[href^="#"]') but seems to break when I add the document URL in front of that
[21:03:12] <Kal_crunchbang> any one here know php?
[21:03:43] <systemfault> The answer would be yes... but how is it related to jquery
[21:07:29] <systemfault> PHP, even if it's a pile of shit... is still a must-have skill for a web developer.
[21:07:46] <snover> wat
[21:10:00] <tw2113> i actually enjoy php
[21:10:05] <prbc> disagree
[21:10:11] <prbc> nobody have to learn php
[21:10:46] <systemfault> prbc: I see it as a "skill to pay the bills", my first job was a shitty PHP website
[21:11:44] <tw2113> you don't have to enjoy it, but it has enough demand that you could pay bills with it
[21:11:49] <prbc> I know, mine too. However, today I know many people starting with python, ruby
[21:11:51] <pom_life> You guys seeing this awesome jQuery discussion on ##php?
[21:11:59] <systemfault> wtf.
[21:12:11] <systemfault> So... we're talking about PHP here... and jQuery over there?
[21:12:34] <pom_life> not really :l
[21:12:47] <tw2113> systemfault, we're in twin peaks
[21:12:57] <prbc> man
[21:13:09] <prbc> jquery is just a framework
[21:13:18] <systemfault> Not even a framework, it's just a lib
[21:13:25] <systemfault> That's why it became so popular
[21:13:26] <prbc> yeah
[21:13:27] <pom_life> oh yeah? well technically php is just a framework of the universe
[21:13:39] <systemfault> PHP is a programming language
[21:13:43] <prbc> but, we can talk about languages with that
[21:14:14] <pom_life> In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code
[21:14:20] <pom_life> if photons are in our computer screens
[21:14:26] <pom_life> php is an abstract way of changing those photons
[21:14:48] <pom_life> therefore php is a framework of the universe
[21:14:58] <tw2113> php = 42 ?
[21:15:04] <pom_life> naturally
[21:15:11] <systemfault> That would make sense.... see how the world is messed up
[21:15:35] <pom_life> Velveeta: Welcome home.
[21:15:57] <systemfault> Can we call him "ProcessedCheese"?
[21:16:08] <tw2113> Velveeta, if you were here earlier, i would have asked you for some JS help
[21:16:11] <pom_life> That would be disgraceful.
[21:20:42] <pom_life> Discussion topic: As a web developer, what are the key things you notice when browsing a new website?
[21:22:03] <systemfault> Depends on what your OCD is.
[21:22:09] <systemfault> Mine is about padding.
[21:23:44] <tw2113> its doctype
[21:25:40] <prbc> load time
[21:25:52] <tw2113> its jquery version
[21:26:04] <prbc> omg
[21:26:34] <tw2113> specifically if it's 1.4.x or not
[21:28:08] * systemfault imagines tw2113 writing javascript:alert(jQuery.fn.version); in his address bar everytime he loads a new website
[21:28:36] <systemfault> Err
[21:28:42] <tw2113> console.log(), fool
[21:28:46] <systemfault> javascript:alert(jQuery.fn.jquery);
[21:29:26] <systemfault> But with javascript:alert(jQuery.fn.jquery);  you can make your own bookmarklet
[21:29:37] <tw2113> meh, i need to practice typing all that
[21:29:47] <tw2113> i get bonus points if i succeed when drunk
[21:30:07] <systemfault> Another shooter everytime it prints "undefined"
[21:30:19] <systemfault> Until you succeed... or pass out
[21:31:06] <tw2113> web developer drinking games
[21:33:14] <pom_life> a shot every time you see something you need to fix but can't because you're already working on something else
[21:35:30] <pom_life> If I were developing an app that required heavy table management, what library or framework would you recommend?
[21:58:10] <prbc> pom_life: what you mean with havy table management?
[21:58:22] <prbc> sort, crud?
[21:59:13] <prbc> if so, datatables for sure
[21:59:42] <pom_life> No
[21:59:49] <pom_life> like... if I were making a game board
[22:00:35] <prbc> I would say, dont use tables
[22:00:46] <pom_life> I'm not down to learn canvas atm
[22:00:52] <pom_life> I'm wanting to experiment some more
[22:02:11] <pom_life> Let's sa I wanted an easier way to go about > for (x;x<15;x++) {for (y;y<15;< y++(){ gameBoard[x][y] = new Tile(); }} <   that. Would datatables work well?
[22:02:31] <Whirl3d> Hey all. I have been asked to animate some water in a full screen image and wondered if anyone had any suggestions via jquery?
[22:02:50] <pom_life> Whirl3d: I've got just the fiddle for you.
[22:03:09] <Whirl3d> do tell, thanks for the reply pom_life...
[22:03:35] <pom_life> Whirl3d: Why not use a background image that looks like water and animate like this? >: http://jsfiddle.net/pomlife/DX3u6/4/
[22:03:42] <zumba_addict> hey guys, when you're building an app, do you draw the webpage first? or do you start coding right away?
[22:03:55] <pom_life> I draw it
[22:03:58] <zumba_addict> k
[22:03:58] <pom_life> and label objects
[22:04:13] <zumba_addict> i'm wondering why i can't start any project :(
[22:04:22] <pom_life> what kind of project are you wanting to start?
[22:04:26] <zumba_addict> i've always just been working on existing projects
[22:04:37] <zumba_addict> pom_life, I'm not sure which project I want to try
[22:04:46] <pom_life> What sort of things are you interested in?
[22:04:54] <zumba_addict> i was previously thinking of building a simple bodybuilding webpage
[22:05:01] <zumba_addict> i'm interested in photography
[22:05:09] <zumba_addict> electronics
[22:05:24] <pom_life> You do any music?
[22:05:32] <zumba_addict> i love music too but only listen
[22:05:39] <pom_life> Oh, no theory? Damn. lol
[22:05:39] <zumba_addict> i can play guitar a little
[22:05:46] <zumba_addict> i play piano too
[22:05:58] <pom_life> I'm in the planning stages of a new guitar learning software on the web
[22:06:04] <zumba_addict> awesome
[22:06:15] <pom_life> I think I have a revolutionary way to teach it
[22:06:20] <zumba_addict> nice
[22:06:42] <pom_life> by using a platformer game and detecting guitar input
[22:06:43] <zumba_addict> there is a guitar player that I want to be but it's really difficult to impossib;e
[22:06:51] <pom_life> and different chords are different attacks
[22:06:54] <zumba_addict> man, that would be awesome
[22:07:30] <zumba_addict> Do you know Andy Mckee?
[22:07:47] <pom_life> he did drifting
[22:08:00] <zumba_addict> don't know drifting
[22:08:08] <zumba_addict> oh the song
[22:08:09] <zumba_addict> :D
[22:08:15] <zumba_addict> i'm playing it now
[22:08:19] <pom_life> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ddn4MGaS3N4
[22:08:21] <pom_life> lol
[22:08:29] <zumba_addict> yup, that's how i learned about him
[22:08:34] <zumba_addict> first learned about him
[22:08:48] <zumba_addict> years of practice
[22:09:01] <pom_life> I do a lot of stuff similar to that
[22:09:19] <Whirl3d> How would I go about animating opacity for multiple background images? or should I just layer images and animate their opacity accordingly?
[22:09:23] <zumba_addict> so i guess, in order for me to start a webpage, I should think about my area of interests, draw it and make a storyboard
[22:09:46] <zumba_addict> wow pom_life ! Amazing
[22:09:52] <pom_life> use timers and adjust the opacity at a certain % per tick
[22:10:18] <pom_life> yeah zumba
[22:10:22] <pom_life> label every object
[22:10:35] <pom_life> and in colored pencil make a line to each objectexplaining what it connects to
[22:10:35] <zumba_addict> when you say label, waht does it mean?
[22:10:39] <pom_life> and how they interact
[22:10:42] <zumba_addict> do you have an example?
[22:10:59] <pom_life> like
[22:11:05] <pom_life> here i'll take a picture
[22:11:09] <zumba_addict> cool
[22:11:10] <zumba_addict> :)
[22:11:19] <Whirl3d> I haven't seen anyone use opacity in background images yet. Still looking. Perhaps I should just layer images rather than use them as backgrounds
[22:11:43] <pom_life> oh
[22:11:45] <pom_life> didn't see bg images
[22:11:56] <pom_life> yeah with images you can make frames
[22:12:06] <pom_life> and set an object with a framerate property
[22:12:20] <pom_life> and timer adjust the frame at the desired framerate
[22:12:31] <pom_life> and then clear the interval when done
[22:12:49] <pom_life> do you understand?
[22:14:55] <Whirl3d> Yeah. I was hoping there was a better solution to simulate water running.
[22:16:52] <Whirl3d> In Flash, we used texture maps to do it. I haven't seen anyone doing that outside of flash.
[22:19:53] <zumba_addict> maybe, I'll use photograpy as my interest
[22:20:34] <zumba_addict> then I'll add map and put a marker to the long/lat where I took the shot. The marker is clickable
[22:21:16] <pom_life> zumba_addict: Make something that benefits you in some way.
[22:21:27] <pom_life> chances are if you need it, someone else needs it too.
[22:21:30] <zumba_addict> yup, I'll do that
[22:21:36] <zumba_addict> where you able to find a pic?
[22:21:46] <pom_life> I'm uploading one now
[22:21:51] <zumba_addict> cool
[22:22:00] <zumba_addict> thanks a lot
[22:22:37] <zumba_addict> it's been my problem since I learned internet. I've always wanted to build a website from scratch but only few came into reality
[22:23:07] <zumba_addict> maybe i only built 3-5 websites and they are not big, LOL
[22:24:52] <pom_life> zumba_addict: > http://imgur.com/evfp4F0 <    developed into > http://winningfunraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html <
[22:24:58] <zumba_addict> looking
[22:25:23] <zumba_addict> the second link is dead
[22:25:36] <pom_life> http://www.winningfundraising.net/Games/traproom/traproom.html
[22:25:54] <zumba_addict> you built that game?
[22:26:05] <pom_life> yeah a couple of days ago
[22:26:14] <zumba_addict> awesome
[22:26:34] <pom_life> that's what i like to do is make little games like that
[22:26:38] <pom_life> you know cookie clicker?
[22:26:39] <zumba_addict> nice
[22:26:43] <zumba_addict> no
[22:26:51] <pom_life> you've really never heard of cookie clicker?
[22:26:57] <systemfault> pom_life: :'(
[22:27:09] <zumba_addict> no, never heard
[22:27:13] <systemfault> pom_life: I waste my time clicking when I'm at the restroom..
[22:27:34] <pom_life> okay, it's a browser-based game. You click a cookie, and build stuff. It's okay, nothing special.
[22:27:39] <pom_life> But people got addicted AF to it
[22:27:47] <zumba_addict> maybe this is it, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSvKjNKyZhE
[22:27:48] <pom_life> I want to do a similar one, with another game element to it
[22:27:56] <systemfault> I use the iphone version.. which isn't as good as the browser-based version
[22:28:08] <systemfault> pom_life: You've seen "Clicking bad"?
[22:28:16] <systemfault> http://clickingbad.nullism.com/
[22:28:26] <pom_life> yes
[22:28:28] <pom_life> that is what
[22:28:29] <pom_life> i am making
[22:28:35] <pom_life> but different elements
[22:29:12] <pom_life> i've been testing making small minigames in jquery
[22:29:21] <zumba_addict> :)
[22:29:26] <pom_life> and I think I can string enough of them together to make something really fun
[22:29:47] <pom_life> zumba_addict: Ever played final fantasy tactics?
[22:30:02] <zumba_addict> I just saw it, love the graphics
[22:30:21] <pom_life> There's a feature where you send members of your party on missions
[22:30:22] <zumba_addict> not really sure why i lost interests in games after I graduated college
[22:30:32] <pom_life> and they are either successful or unsuccessful
[22:30:38] <zumba_addict> i played Prince of Persia
[22:30:40] <pom_life> i was going to incorporate something like that
[22:30:45] <zumba_addict> ah cool
[22:31:06] <zumba_addict> i've got ps3 and xbox360 here at home. My boys love it
[22:31:20] <pom_life> How old are you?
[22:32:19] <zumba_addict> 42
[22:32:28] <zumba_addict> my friends are still addicted to games
[22:32:51] <zumba_addict> but i'm addicted to programming/diy at home
[22:33:04] <zumba_addict> i love building stuff
[22:33:12] <pom_life> i'm 21. one day i randomly lost interest in playing games and gained an interest in making them
[22:33:19] <zumba_addict> :)
[22:33:39] <pom_life> i have more fun watching lets plays than playing most games
[22:33:50] <pom_life> while coding
[22:34:16] <BoM> hello all, was wondering if I could pick someones brain?
[22:34:35] <pom_life> ask don't ask to ask~
[22:35:01] <zumba_addict> :D
[22:35:14] <BoM> lol sorry...not to sure of the etiquette
[22:35:17] <zumba_addict> BoM, don't ask those question, just ask
[22:35:38] <BoM> just trying to be respectfull...i will ask away, thanks
[22:35:47] <zumba_addict> but you should also learn to wait if nobody knows the answer :)
[22:35:57] <pom_life> Generally when in programming channels, if you have a question you are encouraged to just ask the question, instead of asking for permission to ask a question (which you just asked anyway)
[22:38:38] <BoM> I have an app I just finished and was wondering if I can post the code for someone to check to see if I am getting optimal performance. It does work, but I am not sure if it is working as good as it can
[23:25:41] <pom_life> zumba_addict: Still there?
[23:26:40] <zumba_addict> hey
[23:26:51] <zumba_addict> almost about to sleep in front of my laptop, lol
[23:27:17] <zumba_addict> pom_life: why?
[23:27:34] <pom_life> hope you had a good valentines day man. i'm logging off for the night.
[23:28:01] <zumba_addict> no, I got stuck at work today
[23:28:09] <zumba_addict> I got home around 7pm
[23:28:18] <zumba_addict> we didn't get a change to go out but will do it tomorrow
[23:28:36] <zumba_addict> alright, I'm sleeping soon too
[23:28:40] <zumba_addict> thanks for the ideas :)
[23:34:46] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/125/ anyone an idea why this page is bad rendered on IE9?
[23:35:02] <jop008> FF, Safari and Chrome are doing okay
