[00:05:31] <Gazpacho> chrome will detect that a page does not return from the script, but I don't think it will detect that the page is unresponsive due to having to process too many events
[00:07:18] <rocket_> Hey guys is there a plugin or easy way to populate inputs based on either option selection or data entered into an input? Thanks for any advice/guidance
[00:24:15] <nessus> ..
[00:38:46] <vinex08> how to make this auto slide? http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/
[00:46:51] <J4M> I'm using this script http://www.brightcherry.co.uk/scribbles/jquery-auto-refresh-div-every-x-seconds/
[00:47:38] <nessus> hi, is there a backbone chat room?
[00:47:45] <J4M> how can I go about adding the following: check if file is different, then load() it
[00:48:07] <nessus> using javascript?
[00:48:28] <nessus> i don't think you can in a browser environment
[00:49:04] <ngharo> you'd have to poll a service that would return a md5sum for instance
[00:49:17] <J4M> hmm
[00:49:43] <J4M> I was hoping I could just do a simple !== on the div
[00:50:03] <ngharo> or just grab it and let the browser cache do its thing
[00:50:22] <J4M> this is for a flash, and it causes the flash to reload
[00:50:30] <ngharo> ack
[00:50:45] <ngharo> you just said the F word
[00:51:17] <J4M> yeah, youtube :/
[00:51:49] <greg5green> j4m, do you have access to what the flash piece is doing?
[00:52:02] <J4M> nope, it's an iframe
[00:52:09] <greg5green> then you're straight up screwed
[00:52:19] <greg5green> especially since its an iframe
[00:52:21] <greg5green> :P
[00:52:33] <J4M> I just get something that refreshes every 10 seconds
[00:52:49] <greg5green> does the flash piece ever actually change?
[00:52:52] <J4M> instead of something that only refreshes it when the .php is changed
[00:52:54] <greg5green> I mean, you might interact with it
[00:52:54] <J4M> yes
[00:53:02] <vinex08> how to make this auto slide? http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/
[00:53:04] <J4M> the .php just has the simple youtube iframe
[00:53:13] <J4M> and it changes
[00:53:35] <greg5green> well good luck
[00:54:03] <ngharo> fetch it, grep for the iframe src url, if != old, write it to page
[00:54:08] <greg5green> i chimed in because i had knowledge about communicating between js and flash, but its 4am and i dont want to get into the rabbit hole of looking random shit up on the internet
[00:54:35] <J4M> and it looks like jquery can't do that ngharo
[00:54:46] <ngharo> it can
[00:54:55] <J4M> hmm
[00:55:01] <greg5green> 1. it probably still can
[00:55:13] <greg5green> 2. even if it couldnt, dont act like jquery is the only solution to your problem
[00:55:19] <J4M> yeah I know
[00:56:28] <ngharo> $.ajax(url, function(data) { if(data.indexOf(old_iframe_src) { // do something });
[00:56:36] <J4M> thanks a lot
[00:56:41] <ngharo> without the syntax errors
[00:57:02] <ngharo> and a NOT condition
[00:57:20] <ngharo> or rather === -1
[01:00:48] <J4M> I don't actually know javascript
[01:01:06] <J4M> so I'm still figuring it out
[01:02:17] <J4M> but with ajax I'm in the right direction
[01:08:01] <J4M> ajax get with ifModified:true might be what I need
[01:09:38] <juan_> Hi, greetings from colombia
[01:11:41] <juan_> I have a jquery question, I really spend hours and I can't found the solution. Can you give a hand?
[01:11:46] <erisco> is there a way to tell jquery explicitly that I am trying to construct elements from an html string? I think it is confusing my html with a selector
[01:12:29] <ngharo> whats your string
[01:12:36] <erisco> really long
[01:12:37] <nessus> erisco: $.html('your_html_string')
[01:12:40] <greg5green> juan, jst ask
[01:12:45] <nessus> wouldn't this work?
[01:12:54] <greg5green> if someone can help, they will
[01:13:17] <greg5green> erisco, why would you do that?
[01:13:27] <greg5green> why would you not just assemble it as a string
[01:13:33] <erisco> nessus, I have 'no method html
[01:13:50] <greg5green> thats beacuse that isnt something that jquery lets you do
[01:14:03] <greg5green> $.html isnt a real thing afaik
[01:14:14] <juan_> I have this code http://jsfiddle.net/sV8jq/
[01:15:07] <erisco> if I do  $("<div/>").html(string)  it works, which hints to me that there isn't a root
[01:15:17] <juan_> the 48 and 49 line don work I dont know ahy but is a type some undefinide word like this http://jsfiddle.net/sV8jq/1/  the 48 and 49 works!
[01:15:25] <greg5green> "<div/>" isnt a real selector erisco
[01:16:10] <nessus> yeah, it mean to use a selector them call .html on it
[01:16:15] <djQuery>  $('<div/>").html(string); creates a new div with what ever is in the string variable in it
[01:16:18] <J4M> ugh
[01:16:30] <greg5green> juan_, im taking a look, but give me a second, im reformatting what you put so i can read it
[01:16:31] <erisco> I know what it does
[01:16:39] <nessus> like: $('#my-root').html('raw-html-string')
[01:16:40] <J4M> even with ifmodified:true it still loads
[01:16:46] <J4M> the old php
[01:17:04] <juan_> its just a mistery to me (Im a newbie so speak) why the sucess lines works with the undefinide word?? but doesn't work without it? is so rare...
[01:17:48] <juan_> thanks greg5green
[01:18:08] <ngharo> juan_: ID is not defined when your success callback fires
[01:19:14] <ngharo> i think
[01:19:25] <juan_> ngharo but if a do console.log( $("#four_" + ID)); on firebug it shows the ID
[01:20:14] <juan_> I mean the real rare think is the code works perfecly if a put a ramdon undefenide work below into sucess function .
[01:20:23] <juan_> I dont undertand why..
[01:20:52] <greg5green> juan_:
[01:20:55] <erisco> if you reread my question, I am suspicious that jquery is treating my html string as a selector. to remove that possibility I am looking for a function to call that is specifically for html
[01:20:59] <juan_> By the way: sorry for my english Im from Colombia and make language mistakes occasionally
[01:21:00] <erisco> rather than both selectors and html
[01:21:34] <greg5green> since you havent posted more, i cant tell you much for sure but everything "looks" right besides missing a semicolon on line 16
[01:21:54] <greg5green> that plus it works with that weird undefined thing underneath it
[01:21:59] <greg5green> says to me that you have syntax errors
[01:22:12] <greg5green> semicolon insertion is a broad topic that f's a lot of ppl up if they arent careful
[01:22:46] <greg5green> erisco, you need to go back and re-read the documentation for jquery
[01:22:53] <greg5green> rather, you should
[01:22:57] <greg5green> not, need
[01:23:07] <greg5green> afaik, the way you are trying to do things isnt something you can do
[01:23:17] <erisco> greg5green, you do not understand what I am doing
[01:23:25] <greg5green> you can do what you want to do, but not the way you are trying to say you are trying to do things
[01:23:44] <greg5green> it isnt dojo's dom.construct method
[01:23:49] <greg5green> it doesnt work anything like that
[01:24:02] <erisco>  I am not familiar with that
[01:24:14] <ngharo> greg5green: $("<div>foobar</div>"); is perfectly fine
[01:24:27] <ngharo> erisco: have you tried wrapping your string in div tags like above perhaps
[01:24:50] <erisco> as I said, if I try   $("<div/>").html(string)   it works fine
[01:24:54] <ngharo> although, i have a hard time believing you found a use case that busted through all the unit tests
[01:25:00] <juan_> greg5green Im correct the semicolon on line 16 bu still not working
[01:25:14] <erisco> the problem being that I have an extra div floating around
[01:25:17] <greg5green> sorry juan_, i dont see anything offhand that would fix your problem
[01:25:21] <greg5green> erisco
[01:25:31] <greg5green> you are just trying to make some html
[01:25:34] <ngharo> erisco: fiddle it
[01:25:35] <greg5green> why are you not just making it in a string
[01:25:49] <greg5green> and putting into the dom element you want to do it to?
[01:25:51] <juan_> yes, I know, I ask everywhere stackoverflow chats, here, I really read so many pages, and It seems a great mistery
[01:26:01] <erisco> greg5green, I do not understand your question. My string does contain html
[01:26:07] <greg5green> var myString = '<div>my content</div>'
[01:26:08] <greg5green> then
[01:26:25] <greg5green> $('.classWhereIreallyWantToPlaceThis').append(myString);
[01:26:32] <greg5green> maybe its appendTo
[01:26:34] <greg5green> or after
[01:26:37] <greg5green> idk offhand
[01:27:17] <greg5green> juan_, someone might be able to debug better if you provided more than that little section of js
[01:27:44] <clu3> hello all, does this $element.find('.item.active') mean find element that has 2 classes 'item' & 'active'?
[01:27:53] <juan_> greg5green_ Im gonna upload the entire code.
[01:28:14] <greg5green> juan_: the entire code isnt all that useful unless it is working code
[01:28:15] <greg5green> like
[01:28:26] <greg5green> the site we can use the inspector tools on to set breakpoints and such
[01:29:09] <erisco> well damn, it is multiple roots after all. no idea why that is cropping up... prolly broken html
[01:29:10] <greg5green> or at least, abstract it out to a working example in jsfiddle of how it should work on the site
[01:29:53] <juan_> by the way. Im a "young" lawyer from colombia, Im not a programmer but someday (few months ago) I found a php code and I fell in love with web develoment, Im relative newbie on js and jquery but I know a few things like use jquery plug ins (like jqgrid or jqueryui) undertand the code, etc etc etc
[01:30:54] <greg5green> erisco, you dont have to explain yourself to me, but can you explain why you are trying to do it that way
[01:30:55] <erisco> lol damn it is the extra line returns before the content... ends up in a text element
[01:31:13] <greg5green> from what i can tell from the docs there is no $.html()
[01:31:18] <erisco> greg5green, I don't understand what you are asking still. What I do know is that you probably are not understanding what I am doing
[01:31:20] <greg5green> (or at least, it shouldnt be used that way)
[01:32:31] <greg5green> you are trying to construct new dom elements from a string
[01:35:02] <erisco> greg5green, yes, indeed
[01:36:03] <greg5green> making the string requires no jquery
[01:36:04] <greg5green> at all
[01:36:09] <erisco> correct
[01:36:11] <greg5green> you know that part already
[01:36:30] <greg5green> what are you trying to do with this html thats in a string?
[01:36:34] <greg5green> im assuming place it somewhere
[01:36:38] <greg5green> am i correct?
[01:36:44] <erisco> not immediately, no
[01:37:03] <greg5green> you want to just have it hanging out then?
[01:37:09] <greg5green> or you intend to do things to it?
[01:37:16] <erisco> it will hang out for a bit, then end up somewhere
[01:37:29] <greg5green> so you are still putting it in something
[01:37:32] <greg5green> just constructing it
[01:37:36] <greg5green> and letting it hang out for a bit
[01:37:40] <juan_> this is my entire code http://jsfiddle.net/sV8jq/3/ without php process files
[01:37:43] <ngharo> greg5green is really made you're wrapping your html in a jquery object
[01:37:47] <erisco> constructing it, hangs out for a bit, ends up somewhere later on
[01:37:49] <ngharo> s/made/mad/
[01:38:08] <juan_> is a modification that I did of this code http://www.9lessons.info/2011/04/live-table-edit-delete-with-pagination.html
[01:38:28] <greg5green> ngharo, i dont think mad is the right reason
[01:38:39] <greg5green> or right wording rather
[01:38:55] <greg5green> then erisco, why bother with this $.html business?
[01:39:02] <greg5green> set it as a variable
[01:39:02] <erisco> ngharo, it isn't just that as far as I can tell (unless it lazily buffers all operations until it is inserted into DOM). I need to bind to events on elements within, for example
[01:39:04] <greg5green> let it hang out
[01:39:18] <juan_> borrar button = delete button modificar button = modify and guardar button = save
[01:39:19] <erisco> greg5green, well, I'd keep answering your questions, but I already solved the problem a few minutes ago
[01:39:46] <greg5green> I obviously cant see everything you did, but from an architectural standpoint, it sounds wrong to me
[01:39:56] <greg5green> I'm just trying to help in the long run
[01:40:08] <ngharo> erisco: yeah i get you, i do it myself
[01:40:14] <greg5green> even if you made jquery do what you wanted to do, it doesn't necessarily mean its "fixed"
[01:40:26] <ngharo> construct new jq object, bind data attributes, events, etc then write to dom
[01:41:11] <juan_> maybe my code is diffuse but remember that Im not an expert, Im learning all the time.
[01:49:54] <greg5green> ngharo, erisco: if you look at the source, it shows that the way you are using the html method isnt something its meant to do
[01:50:14] <greg5green> im glad it works for you though
[01:50:34] <erisco> greg5green, again, I don't know what you are getting at. Source for what? What HTML method?
[01:50:42] <greg5green> the jquery source
[01:51:07] <greg5green> the method html in the jquery source
[01:51:21] <greg5green> rather, the method 'html' in the jquery source
[01:51:37] <erisco> okay, well, I don't know what the issue is
[01:52:39] <greg5green> if you dont see the issue, dont worry about it
[01:53:01] <greg5green> if i had to maintain your code, we'd have a big discussion, but i don't so, happy trails
[01:53:24] <erisco> ... alright then
[01:54:53] <greg5green> juan_:
[01:55:07] <greg5green> i keep seeing "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token & "
[01:55:12] <greg5green> in my console
[01:55:33] <djQuery> well go look at what line it is complaining about
[01:56:21] <greg5green> fiddle.jshell.net:340
[01:56:30] <greg5green> yeah, its on line 340 of the jsfiddle page :s
[01:56:54] <greg5green> I would have looked at it if that was an actual thing I could look at
[01:57:24] <juan_> greg5green maybe you have a diferent jquery version more newer
[01:57:40] <juan_> and that's the reason for the sintax error in your console?
[01:57:52] <greg5green> you didnt set one in the fiddle
[01:57:56] <greg5green> which i should have checked
[01:58:34] <juan_> when you watch the sintax eror?
[01:58:35] <juan_> http://jsfiddle.net/sV8jq/3/
[01:58:44] <juan_> where*
[01:58:45] <J4M> is there a workaround for ajax ifmodified
[01:58:49] <J4M> because it doesn't work
[01:58:55] <J4M> seems to be a known bug
[01:59:12] <ngharo> greg5green: ya i dont use the html method for constructing new objects. just just wrap my string in $( )
[01:59:48] <greg5green> juan_, in the javascript console
[01:59:52] <ngharo> or often $('<div/>', {class: 'foo', id: 'bar'}) etc
[02:00:50] <greg5green> which i think is different than what he was trying to do
[02:00:56] <greg5green> at least it was based on what he was saying
[02:01:09] <juan_> greg5green Im not have the error on mine
[02:01:46] <ngharo> juan_: its all that minified code pasted in your <head>.  it has &amp; and stuff in it
[02:01:50] <ngharo> throwing errors
[02:05:11] <ngharo> djQuery: i still have a the jQwiggle bookmarklet in my bookmark bar :3
[02:05:32] <ngharo> err nm, that was abjorn
[02:05:35] <ngharo> disregard
[02:06:28] * ngharo sleeps
[02:06:37] <juan_> Im uploading the full thing on a server
[02:07:08] <greg5green> im taking off, have a nice night all
[02:12:19] <J4M> would it be possible to do something like this:
[02:12:23] <J4M> if ($("#update").text() == $.get('update.php') {
[02:12:24] <J4M>     $("#update").load('update.php');
[02:12:27] <J4M> }
[02:12:51] <J4M> maybe I can have it contiously load a display:none; div
[02:12:59] <J4M> that'd be a decent hack
[02:15:06] <J4M> I meant !==
[02:28:54] <Gazpacho> J4M: I don't see what purpose the !== would serve
[02:29:02] <J4M> I got it
[02:30:12] <J4M> it's not pretty but it works
[02:30:39] <danheberden> J4M: that isn't valid javascript
[02:31:15] <danheberden> also, icky
[02:31:43] <Gazpacho> dan: he did say "something like"
[02:32:03] <Gazpacho> and yes, loading the same data twice to decide whether to use it for no apparent benefit is icky
[02:33:42] <J4M> indeed
[02:34:23] <Gazpacho> hope you're not under the impression that it's necessary
[02:34:58] <danheberden> well, assuming the .text() would === the html from the dom would be really crazy
[02:34:58] <J4M> well I dont exactly have time to trying to force ajax to work so I'm happy
[02:35:09] <danheberden> there should be another metric to know that you've loaded that content
[02:35:28] <danheberden> also, check out who keeps favoriting random tweets of mine! http://danheberden.com/share/5b2da.png
[02:35:35] <danheberden> silly twitters
[02:37:57] <Gazpacho> hmph
[02:55:22] <etfb> I was hoping to use a menubar, but it seems it was removed from JQuery UI and will be put in later? Is that true? What are my best options? Revert to an older version?
[03:00:44] <etfb> It seems like new versions of JQuery actually remove features that existed in old versions. Is that right? It makes zero sense to me...
[03:08:44] <etfb> Never mind. I'll try something else. Looks like the menubar stuff in beta is still a looooong way off.
[03:42:10] <vinex08> how to make this auto slide? http://jqueryfordesigners.com/coda-slider-effect/
[04:34:57] <kristofers> Can anyone help me figure out what's happening in my calculation
[04:34:59] <kristofers> http://jsfiddle.net/xwP5z/
[04:35:22] <kristofers> add a few row, and fill in some random numbers
[04:59:57] <tai_chi> hello again
[05:00:15] <tai_chi> do you like Tai Chi music ?
[05:27:44] <enerel1> hi all
[05:28:37] <enerel1> is there any jquery script like firebug inpect element?
[05:29:04] <deepy> What is it that you want to do?
[05:29:30] <enerel1> i want to find from any website select tag which is selected
[05:29:44] <enerel1> sorry for my bad english
[05:29:56] <enerel1> exactly same as firebug inspect element
[05:30:25] <enerel1> just need selected item's html
[05:30:57] <enerel1> not whole html, only container TAG
[05:31:06] <deepy> Could you attach to mouseover?
[05:31:06] <enerel1> it is clear?
[05:31:34] <deepy> http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/
[05:32:39] <enerel1> yes that's right
[05:33:30] <deepy> There you have the solution then :-)
[05:33:31] <deepy> Enjoy!
[05:33:51] <enerel1> but how to select that container tag with values
[05:34:32] <enerel1> id, class, name and so on
[05:34:44] <enerel1> exaclty like in source
[05:44:17] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/42kfB/1/
[05:44:22] <anew> can someone help me with this simple ajax problem
[05:44:33] <anew> why am i not seeing the value of email in the response here
[05:44:36] <anew> line 19 is the php
[05:46:02] <anew> if i make data "email=" + email
[05:46:03] <anew> this works
[05:46:09] <anew> but when i change it to how it is now it does not
[05:48:14] <anew> anyone ?
[05:48:36] <sacho> anew, jquery doesn't send properties which don't have a value
[05:48:47] <anew> they have values
[05:48:54] <sacho> not in your test case
[05:49:08] <anew> well in the real case it does... if i make data: "email=" + email
[05:49:09] <anew> it works
[05:49:21] <anew> just when i change it to {email: email} it does not
[05:49:23] <anew> why
[05:49:33] <sacho> it works fine that way.
[05:49:43] <anew> ?
[05:49:46] <sacho> it works fine.
[05:49:51] <anew> no it doesnt
[05:49:56] <anew> i cant var_dump it
[05:49:56] * sacho shrugs
[05:49:56] <b-ot> sacho: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[05:50:44] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/42kfB/2/
[05:50:48] <sacho> ^ check your network log
[05:50:52] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/42kfB/3/
[05:50:53] <anew> here
[05:51:00] <anew> this should make you happy, this is not working
[05:51:07] <anew> but if i make it "email=" +email
[05:51:08] <anew> it does
[05:51:28] <sacho> works fine as well.
[05:52:37] <sacho> perhaps your problem lies with php.
[05:52:47] <anew> var_dump($_POST['email']);
[05:52:52] <anew> this is the only thing in the entire file
[05:53:45] <anew> hmmm
[05:54:47] <anew> actually ajax not responding at all now
[05:54:57] <anew> weird
[05:56:03] <anew> ok
[05:56:06] <anew> u there sacho
[05:56:16] <anew> when i have it set to dataType: json
[05:56:19] <anew> it does not work
[05:56:21] <anew> but when i leave that out
[05:56:22] <anew> it works
[05:56:24] <anew> why is that ?
[05:56:35] <sacho> dataType is a setting for the expected server response
[05:56:42] <sacho> "it does not work" isn't an error
[05:57:18] <anew> when i set datatype to json i cannot vardump email
[05:57:26] <anew> console.log(d) shows nothing
[05:57:39] <anew> if i leave out json console.log(d) shows properly
[05:57:40] <anew> why
[05:57:56] <sacho> because the server's response isn't json.
[05:58:07] <anew> mmmm
[05:58:08] <anew> i see
[05:58:09] <anew> simple answer
[05:58:11] <anew> thanks
[05:58:44] <anew> better to use json when responding so you can use the data correct ?
[05:59:44] <sacho> you should read the documentation on .ajax
[06:01:41] <anew> no when i hardcode a number for email it works, but from the field it does not...
[06:01:55] <sacho> then you aren't fetching a value from the field
[06:02:00] <anew> if i use input from the field and use data:"email=" + email it works
[06:02:10] <anew> but if i use data: {email:email} it does not
[06:04:22] <anew> wait
[06:04:38] <anew> possible retardation problem
[06:05:50] <anew> no...ok let me make the fiddle for everything then
[06:05:51] <anew> one second
[06:07:38] <sacho> read the documentation instead of guessing what to do
[06:08:15] <anew> i'm not guessing i think it's a scope issue because i'm using require.js
[06:08:42] <sacho> this is why you're supposed to post a test case :)

[06:18:18] <anew> can anyone help me with this
[06:18:31] <anew> first why am i not even getting a value on line 9
[06:33:14] <sacho> anew, a lot of problems

[06:34:25] <sacho> http://jsfiddle.net/F3vX9/2/
[06:37:23] <anew> sacho you're /2/ i dont even see the difference, you put var email inside $(login-form)
[06:38:12] <okdamn> hey
[06:38:12] <anew> all you did was remove var login
[06:38:14] <anew> correct
[06:38:19] <okdamn> how do you fire offset bottom ?
[06:38:23] <sacho> that part was a syntax error
[06:38:25] <okdamn> of an element while page scrolling
[06:38:28] <okdamn> i tryed
[06:38:45] <okdamn> window.scroll(offset_bottom = window.height - window.offset().top);
[06:38:48] <okdamn> but it returns
[06:38:50] <okdamn> NaN
[06:39:03] <okdamn> how about?
[06:39:06] <okdamn> thanks
[06:39:25] <anew> sacho u there
[06:39:30] <sacho> yes?
[06:39:35] <anew> this is exactly the same
[06:39:40] <anew> all u did was remove var login
[06:39:44] <okdamn> anew:  pls help me
[06:39:50] <sacho> It's not, the difference is that it actually works.
[06:39:58] <anew> well i need to know what you did
[06:40:02] <anew> because i cant remove var login
[06:40:08] <anew> so your version that works
[06:40:09] <anew> doesnt work
[06:40:09] <sacho> That part was just a syntax error.
[06:40:22] <sacho> I don't know *what* exactly you were trying to achieve with it.
[06:40:35] <anew> i'm returning login... like i said i'm using require.js
[06:40:40] <anew> i just cant have this floating around in there
[06:40:41] <anew> what you did
[06:40:44] <sacho> Well then, you can add it again.
[06:40:53] <anew> but what else did u change besides that
[06:40:55] <anew> i cant see it
[06:41:05] <sacho> But you would still need to somehow add the event listener to the form's submit event
[06:41:31] <sacho> I think you're having a problem visualizing the timeline of events.
[06:41:37] <sacho> Here's what needs to happen.
[06:41:40] <okdamn> hey any help ? :(
[06:41:44] <anew> submit() -> val()
[06:41:45] <anew> ?
[06:42:00] <sacho> Step 1 -> At some point, hopefully before the user can interact with the page, you bind the event listener($.on('submit'))
[06:42:16] <sacho> Step 2, the user submits the form, triggering your submit event listener
[06:42:39] <sacho> At that point, you want to fetch the values of the input fields(since that's when the user has modified them), and then do whatever you want with that ajax.
[06:42:53] <anew> which is why you put val inside submit
[06:43:01] <sacho> Inside the event listener, yes
[06:43:10] <sacho> And also, the event listener must somehow be bound at an appropriate time
[06:43:14] <sacho> depending on what you're using
[06:43:37] <anew> just one question on terminology... event listener is any function we are applying to a div
[06:43:40] <anew> in this case there are 2
[06:43:43] <anew> submit and val
[06:43:45] <anew> correct ?
[06:43:45] <sacho> no
[06:43:49] <anew> wups
[06:43:56] <sacho> event listener is a function that is bound to respond to an event
[06:44:03] <sacho> that binding happens for example via $.on()
[06:44:27] <sacho> $.on('submit', function(){}) <-- submit is the event, function is the "handler", or event listener, or whatever you like calling it.
[06:44:47] <anew> function = event listener/handler
[06:44:49] <anew> ok
[06:44:52] <sacho> (perhaps the more accurate terminology is that a listener is added for that event, which calls your *handler* to handle the event)
[06:47:33] <okdamn> hey how do i get offset bottom of an element on window scroll??
[06:47:37] <okdamn> i tryed this
[06:47:51] <okdamn> $(window).scroll(function(){
[06:47:52] <okdamn>                 var _offset_bottom = parseFloat($(document).height() - $('footer').offset().top).toFixed(1);
[06:47:52] <okdamn>                     console.log(_offset_bottom); });
[06:47:54] <okdamn> but not good
[06:48:07] <okdamn> it returns always 70.0 or 70.4
[06:48:12] <okdamn> can't understand the problem here
[06:48:14] <okdamn> :(
[06:48:16] <okdamn> any help pls?

[10:46:06] <the-voice-> I have a weird situation here
[10:46:15] <the-voice-> .click is not working in ie9
[10:46:21] <the-voice-> but it's working in all the other browsers
[10:47:27] <randomdrake> What does "not working" mean?
[10:47:31] <the-voice-> jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[10:47:39] <the-voice-> it means that when I put alert("here")
[10:47:43] <the-voice-> nothing is triggered
[10:47:58] <the-voice-> I obviously want it to do something else, but I am trying to see if it's triggered at all
[10:48:09] <the-voice-> in all other browsers it is working correctly
[10:48:35] <jackjackw> guys any advice on how I would create a fake scrollbar using jquery?
[10:48:47] <randomdrake> Why on earth would you do that?

[10:49:45] <jackjackw> but the scrollbar cannot be
[10:49:59] <jackjackw> I cannot see another solution
[10:50:53] <jackjackw> the menu is slightly opaque, so you can see the content underneath, seeing the scrollbar would ruin the effect, I can link you to my test case if you wish
[10:51:13] <obert> overflow: hidden
[10:52:42] <jackjackw> obert: with that, how does my scrollbar expand and contract when the menu gets larger or smaller on hover as to not allow them to overlap
[10:53:14] <obert> ?
[10:59:19] <the-voice-> any ideas what can break .click in ie9?

However there is a flaw, some div's contain more then one input field. How can I gather the data from all input fields in the div .div?
[12:39:09] <zergion> rephrased, how can I gather all data from each input field in a div and store them in seperate vars or array
[12:47:21] <zergion> $('.main-settings-container:has(input[type=text])').each(function() { }); something like this. However, since I have lots of divs with the class .main-settings-container. How can I tell the script that only run each in $(this).main-settings-container, and not the others?

[12:55:51] <h6sidhu> But if i sent the blob alone through the websocket, I will get the binary data
[12:56:10] <h6sidhu> my goal is to tag the blob with a userid so the server knows who is sending it
[12:56:38] <jinxdone> maybe you should convert it to base64 for transmission..

[13:21:44] <Cork> scalex000: uh, unless its 42 long values that doesn't sounds like it should be a problem
[13:21:51] <perplexedpointle> hi, this is probably really simple, but I can't figure out how to make this work properly : that is the background color should be under the text and there should be no overlapping of divs - http://jsfiddle.net/GtxdN/1/  - The content in the sliding div is dynamic (variable length)Thanks so much for looking :)

[13:33:28] <Cork> perplexedpointle: if you set a height of an element, and want it to crop the content inside it you want overflow
[13:33:49] <scalex000> yes
[13:33:50] <gordian> you can see that if the LI is too long that the next LI comes right in and fouls things up
[13:33:55] <scalex000> thank you
[13:34:24] <Cork> eccentric_jay: nomrally you do $('element').nameSpace('myFunction')
[13:34:36] <perplexedpointle> Cheers, you guys are the best IRC group
[13:35:29] <eccentric_jay> Cork: I see, in this case was planning on a $('element').pixelMath.alignTo('.container', 'left', 'center');
[13:36:01] <Cork> eccentric_jay: javascirpt doesn't really handle multi level prototype well
[13:36:10] <Cork> that's why its normally a bad idea
[13:36:29] <eccentric_jay> Ah, I see
[13:36:58] <Cork> eccentric_jay: but ya you could create an object and return it when the namespace is called
[13:37:20] <Cork> eccentric_jay: it is doable, but you would have to do quite a bit of trickery
[13:37:27] <eccentric_jay> like $('element').pixelMath().alignTo('.container', 'left', 'center')?
[13:37:38] <Cork> and jquery function chaining would break after your call
[13:37:41] <Gazpacho> gordian: hold on
[13:38:00] <gordian> mkay
[13:38:08] <Cork> eccentric_jay: you don't have to have a function, but ya
[13:38:54] <Cork> but ex. $('element').pixelMath().alignTo('.container', 'left', 'center').animate() or .show() wouldn't work
[13:39:48] <eccentric_jay> Ah makes sense
[13:40:48] <Gazpacho> gordian: do you want there always to be a 5 second delay after the end of typing?
[13:41:02] <gordian> ideally yes
[13:41:16] <eccentric_jay> Perhaps I'm better off writing a more generic wrapper like pixelMath('.element').alignTo('.container', 'left', 'center'); so it's not tied to jQuery anyway
[13:47:19] <gavilan2> Is there any benchmark of jQuery against using the browser stuff directly?
[13:48:48] <Gazpacho> gordian: jsfiddle is not really a convenient way for me to work on this, but based on what you said about the delay, you should start the timer only after the animation is done, not before. That is, your whole animation needs a "done" function as an argument that will start the timer
[13:49:12] <gordian> hmmm
[13:49:48] <gordian> i think the typewriter needs a "done" so the animation doesn't start without it
[13:51:21] <Gazpacho> that could work too, but what you have to wait for is the scrolling followed by the typing
[13:59:03] <h6sidhu> I have a problem. I want to convert a Blob to base 64 so I can send the data to my server. The file I'm sending is an image. I am using FileReader and in the onload callback, I am using btoa(oFREvent.target.result). Is this the right way to do this?
[14:08:49] <Gazpacho> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.btoa
[14:09:02] <Gazpacho> lol it's so pathetic how they pretend that only IE has versions
[14:10:11] <jackjackw> yo guys - can anybody explain to me whats the best method to get the velocity of a mousemove?
[14:10:14] <h6sidhu> Gazpacho: I am already using btoa. I just wanted to know if my method is correct
[14:10:41] <Gazpacho> and I'm making a point about mozilla's documentation
[14:11:06] <h6sidhu> is my method correct?
[14:11:49] <Gazpacho> jack: divide distance by time
[14:12:38] <jackjackw> Gazpacho: thank you
[14:13:56] <h6sidhu> jackjackw: i think he's just a troll ignore him.
[14:14:24] <Gazpacho> kiss my ass
[14:14:36] <jackjackw> h6sidhu: his answer makes sense
[14:14:55] <jackjackw> Gazpacho can I pastebin you something I need help
[14:15:13] <Gazpacho> sorry, maybe someone else
[14:15:26] <jackjackw> np
[14:15:30] <h6sidhu> jackjackw: his retaliation is an example of what a troll does.
[14:17:20] <Gazpacho> h6sidhu: oh I didn't realize that following up on what someone said, but not to answer their question, constituted trolling. Go away.
[14:17:54] <Gazpacho> apparently you think this channel is a bunch o flittle answer robots
[14:18:10] <Gazpacho> for your benefit
[14:18:17] <h6sidhu> Gazpacho: I did not say that not answering a question constitutes trolling. You just assumed that
[14:18:26] <h6sidhu> can you stop retaliating
[14:18:30] <Gazpacho> no
[14:18:45] <h6sidhu> Well Im not replying to your trollish comments no more good day sir.
[14:18:51] <jackjackw> lmao

[14:54:14] <bluesm> hi
[14:54:32] <bluesm> Is there multi-platform setSelectionRange equivalent in jQuery ?
[15:17:17] <bluesm> ?
[15:19:41] <limpc> how do you bind a click event with the jqueryui slider?
[15:20:09] <limpc> theres no event provided by the widget, and trying to bind to the div yields no results (looks like .unbind is called)
[15:32:44] <eziob> isn't .on supposed to handle new elements in the dom?
[15:35:12] <jrajav> eziob: That depends on what you mean
[15:35:28] <bluesm>  Is there multi-platform setSelectionRange equivalent in jQuery ?
[15:35:50] <jrajav> eziob: If you assign an event to an element and a child element is added to that element, it will receive bubbled events for that new child
[15:35:51] <eziob> got it
[15:36:07] <jrajav> eziob: But if you mean that .on should apply to new elements that the selector would apply to later on.. no
[15:36:14] <jrajav> Selectors run when they are run.
[15:36:44] <eziob> i see
[15:36:50] <eziob> i understand the distinction
[15:37:26] <djQuery> $('.now').on('click', '.NowNLatter', funciton(){});
[15:38:08] <djQuery> eziob, ^^^^^
[15:38:25] <eziob> yup
[15:38:36] <eziob> and it makes sense too
[15:54:49] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can recommend the best jquery google maps api?
[16:23:12] <anew> what does status (canceled) mean in network tab chrome
[16:28:28] <anew> i'm always having to use async:false in my ajax calls
[16:28:31] <anew> not sure why
[16:29:58] <sahbeewah> it means you did something or something happened that made that request unnecessary
[16:30:04] <anew> need to add prevent default
[16:30:09] <anew> the page is loading on button submit
[16:52:57] <quazimodo> anyone know of a plugin that takes a regular select box, and implements it as table rows?
[16:53:08] * quazimodo doesn't even know how that would work ffs
[16:58:06] <henn1nk> http://jsfiddle.net/AXsfP/ any idea, what is wrong here?
[17:00:06] <Guddu> Dear friends...I have 2 questions....
[17:00:20] <Guddu> 1. Is it possible to have two $(document).ready(function() in single html ?
[17:00:22] <henn1nk> i receive an unmatched OUTDENT on line 9
[17:00:50] <Guddu> 2. What is the scope of a variable which was declared and defined inside a $(document).ready(function()
[17:00:51] <shoky> henn1nk: your formatting is kinda fucked up, look at first 2 lines
[17:01:06] <shoky> also.. $(elementid).css('display)
[17:01:50] <henn1nk> shoky: oh thanks, that was the problem lol
[17:03:23] <shoky> Guddu 1. yes it's possible. 2. the scope of the var will be as all vars, i.e. the scope of the function it was declared in
[17:03:37] <shoky> 'cept for globals, which this is not
[17:03:59] <Guddu> shoky, Thanks, so if i declare the variable in one $(document).ready(function() it should still be visible in second $(document).ready(function()?
[17:04:08] <shoky> Guddu: no..
[17:04:14] <shoky> Guddu: those are 2 different functions
[17:04:20] <shoky> so 2 different scopes
[17:04:32] <Guddu> shoky, Interestingly I am seeing it in both
[17:05:28] <shoky> seeing what
[17:06:46] <Guddu> The variable visible in second onready
[17:07:01] <shoky> you might be seeing a global one
[17:07:51] <shoky> or.. your .ready() calls are nested in each other ;p
[17:07:59] <Guddu> shoky, Checking that now
[17:08:04] <Guddu> I declared the varaible as message_dictionary={};
[17:08:23] <shoky> you declare variables with 'var'
[17:08:39] <shoky> otherwise you're setting a global one
[17:11:35] <Guddu> shoky, Thanks....So it is a global indeed....Looks like i need to read a lot :-)
[17:11:40] <Guddu> I forgot to add var
[17:11:48] <Guddu> But then global is what i want it to be...SO I am goood...
[17:12:28] <shoky> well, use var anyway
[17:14:59] <Guddu> shoky, The issue is that I am generating the script using templating language ...i m using Django for my web app....So tw on ready functions come...one from base template and once from inherited template...And i want the variable created in base template to be available in custom template at the time of rendering of final HTML (which is a combination of both base and custom template)
[17:16:30] <goose1> Q:does jquery keep ref to the state of an object? eg is repeatedly calling div.hide() is O(1) or i should manage this internally? #micro-optimization
[17:17:24] <systemfault> How would you even apply the O notation here? wtf.
[17:18:51] <shoky> Guddu: oh well
[17:19:04] <systemfault> goose1: "div" in "div.hide()" is the node reference...
[17:20:09] <shoky> maybe by "state" he means hidden/shown
[17:20:21] <RomainT1> Hello
[17:20:25] <shoky> and asking if div.hide() is a noop if its already hiden
[17:20:26] <shoky> hidden
[17:20:33] <goose1> i mean is there a simple var / int that represents the state or each time it tries to figure if the object is hidden.
[17:21:20] <RomainT1> Is someone using textext here? I'm looking for a way to react when user add or remove a tag.
[17:22:33] <Gazpacho> you do not accumulate state by repeatedly hiding something.
[17:22:51] <shoky> goose1: manage it on your own if performance is an issue
[17:23:16] <systemfault> If performance is an issue... don't even use .hide
[17:23:32] <systemfault> Add/Remove a "hidden" class or something.
[17:23:39] <shoky> aye
[17:24:41] <goose1> Ok, thanks shoky, systemfault.
[17:52:02] <xboi209> is there a wildcard in regex?
[17:53:30] <shoky> .
[18:01:08] <Gazpacho> hey everyone, how do i jquery in jquery

[18:20:01] <Gazpacho> ok enough
[18:20:01] <tw2113> not at all
[18:20:07] <Gazpacho> oh you want more?
[18:24:41] <anew> what are all the hidden bots
[18:24:45] <anew> that's whwat i want more of
[18:38:07] <gordian> can anyone recommend a way to make sure the typing finished before a new LI gets added? http://jsfiddle.net/jEzpy/11/
[18:40:32] <Gazpacho> it's too bad jsfiddle doesn't have a "download as git repo" feature
[18:40:57] <tw2113> http://sokolovstas.github.com/SublimeWebInspector/
[18:41:03] <tw2113> for you chrome fanboys
[18:43:06] <roswell> i thought f12 was doing all the stuff for me
[18:44:23] <roswell> so what's the sublime's killer feature?
[18:51:20] <prilax> what's up
[18:52:04] <OliverJAsh> this works in the client-side version of jquery, but not the node version:
[18:52:04] <OliverJAsh> $('html').find('link[type="application/rss+xml"], link[type="application/atom+xml"]').attr('href')
[18:52:23] <OliverJAsh> in node i'm getting TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined at superMatcher (/Users/Oliver/Development/GitHub/parsse/node_modules/jquery/lib/node-jquery.js:5025:25)
[19:03:39] <anew> so stupid question
[19:03:51] <anew> but are mobile sites mostly built with client side language
[19:04:28] <h6sidhu> is there a gzip function for jquery?
[19:04:32] <h6sidhu> I can't seem to find one
[19:05:22] * Gazpacho groans
[19:06:11] <roswell> h6sidhu, for what?
[19:06:22] <h6sidhu> i want to gzip a json string
[19:06:56] <roswell> h6sidhu, let your weberver do that on preference of a visitor
[19:07:20] <h6sidhu> that's not an option for me. I need to gzip a json string for my app lol
[19:07:43] <h6sidhu> im using websockets
[19:08:10] <roswell> websockets are out of my completence
[19:08:19] <roswell> lol competence*
[19:08:39] <h6sidhu> thats fine all i need is a javascript library or jquery plugin that has a gzip algorithm
[19:08:43] <h6sidhu> do you know of any?
[19:10:28] <danheberden> ?g gzip javascript library
[19:10:29] <b-ot> danheberden: ajax - JavaScript implementation of Gzip - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294297/javascript-implementation-of-gzip
[19:10:30] <bot-t> danheberden, ajax - JavaScript implementation of Gzip - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/294297/javascript-implementation-of-gzip
[19:10:42] <h6sidhu> I already looked at that link
[19:10:45] <h6sidhu> it doesnt implement gzip
[19:10:58] <h6sidhu> it uses LZW compression/decompression
[19:11:32] <danheberden> h6sidhu: perhaps one of these? https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/modules#wiki-compression
[19:11:57] <danheberden> might have some javascraps you can use
[19:12:16] <h6sidhu> cool thanks
[19:12:56] <tw2113> eww it's danheberden :P
[19:13:06] <danheberden> OMGGROSS
[19:13:07] <tw2113> don't trust him! it's his first day with mootools!

[19:14:13] <h6sidhu> ahh
[19:14:15] <Gazpacho> hmm auto-translation, I don't know if i'd trust that
[19:14:16] <h6sidhu> zee.js looks nice
[19:14:18] <h6sidhu> thanks Gazpacho
[19:14:20] <Gazpacho> not to me
[19:14:26] <Gazpacho> I just realized it was auto-translated
[19:14:33] <h6sidhu> what do you mean auto translated
[19:14:35] <Gazpacho> but it's all I coudl find
[19:14:54] <tw2113> woo! black death
[19:14:57] <Gazpacho> someone translated the gzip C source code to javascript
[19:15:08] <tw2113> that'd make either a generic band name, or a potentially awesome plugin
[19:15:58] <h6sidhu> hm
[19:16:05] <h6sidhu> do you think this function is incredibly heavy
[19:17:01] <tw2113> what if gzip takes a lot of processing
[19:17:54] <systemfault> You could forget about websockets, use normal HTTP and let the browser ungzip :P
[19:18:03] <danheberden> i don't understand the need for gzip
[19:18:08] <h6sidhu> im streaming video using getusermedia

[19:19:04] <gordian> what else is there?
[19:19:27] <Gazpacho> gordian: undo

[19:20:37] <gordian> whatever, if you wanted to help you would help instead of making excuses
[19:20:50] <Gazpacho> gordian: all right, I don't want to help.
[19:20:58] <gordian> clearly
[19:21:02] <Gazpacho> sucks for you
[19:21:38] <gordian> right, you won't help because there's no undo feature
[19:21:48] <gordian> sounds like you just don't know how to solve the problem
[19:21:51] <danheberden> people are so grumpy today - must be because of st. paddy
[19:21:57] <Gazpacho> gordian: what are you going to do about it
[19:22:13] <gordian> i've been trying nonstop
[19:22:19] <gordian> and i will find a solution with or without you
[19:22:29] * Gazpacho shakes his head
[19:22:32] <danheberden> ?g youtube with or without you

[19:23:50] <Gazpacho> are you still there?
[19:24:21] <danheberden> gordian: your persistence in poking this situation is making things worse. there's like hundreds of other people on this channel that might be able to assist you
[19:24:47] <hugo_moss> haha a helpubut troll
[19:25:59] <gordian> well only a troll has stepped up so anyone who actually knows what they're doing can consider it an open invitation
[19:26:08] <Gazpacho> look, buttwipe, it was an interesting problem you had and I messed with the code a little, but then I would somehow break it unexpectedly and not be able to get back to the last working version. but believe what you want, obviously it's because I just hate you
[19:26:28] <snover> buttwipe
[19:26:28] <b-ot> snover: You have 3 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.

[19:27:58] <tw2113> then code
[19:28:42] <gordian> Gazpacho: that is the lamest excuse ever. period.
[19:29:28] <tw2113> if you save in jsfiddle, you can go back to previous versions
[19:29:42] <gordian> hence it is the lamest excuse ever. period.
[19:30:14] <gordian> he just doesn't know what he's doing and has no clue how to resolve the issue
[19:30:54] <tw2113> for now, i hold everyone responsible and will be talking to a lawyer
[19:31:27] <Gazpacho> it's not an excuse. I don't need an excuse
[19:31:42] <gordian> good then put up or shutup
[19:31:55] <hugo_moss> ooooo snap
[19:31:58] <tw2113> anyone have the # for Lionel Hutz?
[19:32:14] <gordian> but you are totally clueless so just shutup
[19:32:29] <hugo_moss> ooo snap again
[19:32:32] <danheberden> *sigh* this is getting annoying

[19:36:39] <shoky> planning on it
[19:37:37] <shoky> er, if that's even english

[19:37:46] <gordian> couldn't make it work
[19:37:57] <danheberden> there's one thing about booleans
[19:38:13] <danheberden> they suck at managing asynchronous resolution of processes and exposing a way to bind callbacks to that
[19:38:25] <danheberden> they're just so black and white
[19:39:05] <gordian> that's what i found
[19:39:10] <Gazpacho> sounds kinda racist there bro
[19:39:26] <gordian> helpubut, stay out of this
[19:39:40] <Gazpacho> gordian: learn to put me on ignore properly, would you?
[19:39:40] <danheberden> Gazpacho: inorite
[19:40:18] <gordian> it was a 5 min ignore but clearly you want the full treatment
[19:40:34] <Gazpacho> i gave your mom the full treatment
[19:40:38] <danheberden> lol
[19:40:56] <gordian> go troll somewhere else man
[19:41:04] <gordian> seriously
[19:41:12] <gordian> you're not doing *anything* here
[19:41:20] <gordian> ~
[19:41:25] <danheberden> well, he *did* make me laugh; that felt good
[19:41:36] <danheberden> he's doing more than that tw2113 guy
[19:41:39] <danheberden> whoever THAT is
[19:41:40] <gordian> was it really out loud though? or were you just saying that?
[19:41:46] <tw2113> just some dude
[19:41:51] <danheberden> gordian: i actually lol'd
[19:42:00] * tw2113 gnomes more than trolls
[19:42:09] <danheberden> your mom and that's what she said jokes
[19:42:14] <danheberden> are instant happiness for me
[19:42:33] * tw2113 knew that, danheberden's mom told me
[19:42:53] <danheberden> tw2113: you left your shirt at her place, by the way - i got it for ya
[19:43:05] <tw2113> :O my mootools shirt?
[19:43:08] <tw2113> burn it
[19:43:25] <danheberden> ha
[19:43:40] <tw2113> shit...what shirt did i burn the other day?
[19:43:47] <danheberden> i left a shirt at a girls house on accident once - i liked that shirt, too
[19:46:31] <tw2113> hopefully she was worth it
[19:47:13] <tw2113> i left a special edition copy of the movie Freaked at a girl's house once
[19:48:00] <danheberden> haha
[19:48:36] <tw2113> awesome movie, so i'm a bit bummed about losing that still
[19:49:03] <danheberden> have you been working out just one arm in honour of it?
[19:49:40] <tw2113> pervert
[19:59:41] <b1lly> suppers
[20:01:44] <gordian> damn shoky
[20:01:49] <gordian> this blows my mind
[20:10:03] <tai_chi> hello, when I'm surfing some website full of images, how do I generate the Click event on the specified zone of an image , that trigger the "next" load ?
[20:10:55] <tai_chi> i.e. how to manually parse some position params to the mouse click event ?
[20:11:06] <b1lly> tai_chi: I'm sorry?
[20:11:17] <b1lly> you want the mouse coordinates on a click event?
[20:11:40] <tai_chi> $('img#abc").click({pos:32:170}), like this ..
[20:12:09] <b1lly> you want to fire the click event on a certain image?
[20:12:11] <tai_chi> $('img#abc").click({offsetx:32,offsety:170}}) , ahh
[20:12:25] <b1lly> $('img#abc').trigger('click');
[20:13:02] <tai_chi> fire the event on only part of the element zone, that make it "left" or "right"
[20:13:47] <b1lly> add two elements in the zone?
[20:13:55] <b1lly> or, return mouse coordinates and check
[20:13:59] <b1lly> to see if they are in the area
[20:14:31] <tai_chi> parse the faked event param to the function
[20:14:46] <b1lly> you are making no sense
[20:15:10] <tai_chi> surf image websites for fun, like crawling images , and save clicking 'next'
[20:15:29] <tai_chi> here , http://dp.pconline.com.cn/photo/2443314.html
[20:16:35] <tai_chi> asking for tricks, auto click the right half of img model, that turn to the next page .. no sense ya
[20:17:58] <tay1> can you use jquery with another js library/framework like angular/backbone etc
[20:18:34] <systemfault> backbone has a requirement on jQuery
[20:19:15] <tw2113> isn't it all js in the end anyway?
[20:19:23] <systemfault> Angular, probably not.. But I wouldn't add a useless dependancy to angular.
[20:21:20] <tay1> what does useless dependency mean?
[20:21:36] <tay1> im not much of a front end guy but id like to learn some basics stuff since i like working with backend mostly
[20:21:40] <s00pcan> angular has jqlite, a partial jquery implementation
[20:21:48] <tay1> oh ok
[20:21:57] <s00pcan> and if you inclue jquery it will just use that instead
[20:22:06] <tay1> so most of these frameworks are built off jquery?
[20:22:18] <s00pcan> which is built off of..
[20:22:21] <tay1> js
[20:22:22] <tay1> i know that
[20:22:38] <tay1> i know pure js to some extent. just never really dealt with jquery much
[20:22:42] <s00pcan> on their page I think they say sizzle.js but I never looked at it.
[20:22:49] <s00pcan> I think that is the css selector engine?
[20:23:21] <Honeycomb> Does anybody know why http://pastebin.com/yJiCbcLf doesn't work?
[20:23:23] <b1lly> http://www.findyourwaytooz.com/
[20:24:17] <s00pcan> is that comman on the first line supposed to be like that?
[20:24:37] <b1lly> s00pcan: ya thats fine
[20:25:07] <b1lly> Honeycomb: you don't like semi-colins tho ay?
[20:25:22] <Honeycomb> I do, but JavaScript doesn't require them...
[20:25:36] <Honeycomb> It's not working, though...
[20:25:36] <s00pcan> I do a lot of things that aren't required
[20:25:49] <b1lly> what's not working about it?
[20:25:58] <tw2113> i'm fine with adding semicolons anyway
[20:26:09] <Honeycomb> margin-top never gets set to footer
[20:26:31] <b1lly> is footer the element name
[20:26:32] <Honeycomb> footer is an HTML5 tag
[20:26:38] <b1lly> ok
[20:27:00] <b1lly> your missing a {
[20:27:12] <b1lly> on the first else if condition
[20:27:18] <Honeycomb> LOL
[20:27:19] <Honeycomb> Thanks!
[20:27:36] <s00pcan> hey install a static code checker, it catches probles like that
[20:27:37] <Honeycomb> It works!
[20:27:38] <s00pcan> jshint
[20:27:46] <b1lly> you should be able to accomplish what your trying to do with just pure CSS though
[20:28:12] <Honeycomb> CSS frustrates me...
[20:28:18] <tai_chi> http://www.56.com/u18/v_Njk1OTUyNDc.html/1030_ieverloveyou.html
[20:29:22] <tai_chi> var e = new jQuery.Event("click");e.pageX = 10;e.pageY = 10;$("#elem").trigger(e);  should be right anyway
[20:31:42] <b1lly> are you talking to yourself?
[20:32:04] <tai_chi> I just searched out ...
[20:32:31] <tai_chi> but searching always makes me very confused
[20:32:38] <tai_chi> dizzy
[20:32:54] <tai_chi> puzzled
[20:33:14] <tai_chi> but aren't you guys fond of jquery ?
[20:34:02] <tai_chi> or this method could get improved by proper advices
[20:34:17] <Gazpacho> quite fond, i fantasize of frolicking in green meadows with it
[20:35:44] <tai_chi> pardon ?
[20:36:08] <Gazpacho> i want to run through grassy fields, holding jquery's hand
[20:36:16] <tai_chi> lol
[20:36:34] <tai_chi> improper expression ...
[20:37:14] <b1lly> I want to build something
[20:37:16] <b1lly> what do i build
[20:37:37] <b1lly> wtb an idea
[20:38:59] <tai_chi> build a death star is a good idea
[20:39:46] <tai_chi> and how to build a Matrix ...
[20:40:06] <systemfault> So it would be a Matrix within the Matrix.
[20:40:10] <tai_chi> how to build the legendary T-virus
[20:41:20] <tai_chi> rebuild the Matrix movie within a 3D Matrix screen
[20:44:24] <tai_chi> the world is not linear haha
[20:48:22] <tw2113> lets just rebuild dinosaurs
[20:48:25] <tw2113> what could go wrong
[20:48:32] <tai_chi> .trigger( eventType [, extraParameters ] )  ?
[20:51:01] <Gazpacho> yo dawg i heard u like the matrix so i put a matrix in your matrix so you can consume images while you consume images
[20:52:03] <systemfault> emulating a matrix within the matrix must be incredibly memory and cpu intensive :(
[20:52:20] <systemfault> (For the outer matrix)
[20:52:25] <tai_chi> :)
[20:53:03] <tai_chi> at least a 3D Matrix theatre you could build
[20:53:46] <tai_chi> stereo theatre
[20:54:39] <vinex08> so anyone knows how to make the coa slider continoius?
[20:54:45] <vinex08> coda*
[21:00:06] <tai_chi> smoothy ?
[21:00:16] <tai_chi> bouncy ?
[21:00:38] <tai_chi> acceleration ?
[21:12:25] <JBlitzen> Hmm
[21:13:05] <JBlitzen> Is there a simple javascript, jquery, or jquery-ui technique for scrolling an image left-to-right within a div?  I know I can set a timer and move its position manually, but I wonder if there's a more built-in way to do it
[21:15:28] <tai_chi> even, I want the right to left reading style , instead of scroll down, on the front end design
[21:16:13] <tai_chi> most of gurus must be sleeping now
[21:16:26] <tai_chi> mast shifu
[21:16:32] <tai_chi> master shifu
[21:45:34] <djhardrich> I'm using jquery mobile for an offline iOS app, that has roughly 175 videos, each should be on their own page…. A multipage layout seems like the best way to do this (esp since the nested lists are being deprecated), but it doesn't seem like putting all 175 pages in a single html document would be very efficient…. does anyone have any suggestions/tips?
[21:56:00] <xboi209> How do i resume an action that was stopped with event.preventDefault()?
[21:59:19] <aniasis> what other frameworks are like bootstrap
[22:00:24] <vladikoff> aniasis, http://usablica.github.com/front-end-frameworks/compare.html
[22:00:26] <roswell> a fine question for google
[22:03:41] <tai_chi> sometimes this is helpful,   <label><input type="checkbox" /> </label>
[22:05:11] <tw2113> label tags don't need to wrap the inputs, just saying
[22:08:08] <tai_chi> or if the checkbox is inside some dom, and want the checkbox to be checked when the dom is clicked .. this style is simple, and without stopPropagation
[22:09:26] <tai_chi> as <input /> must not be an open tag
[22:13:45] <tw2113> <label>My Label</label><input type="checkbox" val="something" /> would be just fine, last i checked
[22:13:55] <tw2113> and clicking on "my label" would toggle it
[22:14:03] <tw2113> assuming i didn't forget the name/id attributes
[22:14:15] <tw2113> just imagine they're there
[22:16:42] <tai_chi> <td >  ... checkbox ... some text ... </td>
[22:38:40] <jacobroufa> hey room

[23:02:28] <Nobita> Hi, I'm generating some HTML using jQuery, now if I'm trying to apply some effect for eg: bounce to that generated HTML its not working out for me. What should I do? Am I going wrong?
[23:02:53] <runvnc> go to jsfiddle.net and put  your code in there
[23:02:58] <runvnc> then paste a link to it
[23:03:01] <Nobita> ok
[23:03:58] <runvnc> hit control-shift-j on your original page
[23:04:03] <runvnc> are there any errors?
[23:04:07] <runvnc> in the javascript console
[23:04:08] <runvnc> also
[23:04:28] <runvnc> do console.log($('.whatever-selector-it-is'))
[23:04:36] <runvnc> make sure you are actually selecting something to bounce
[23:08:20] <abjorn> guys, i wish you all a terrific weekend
[23:09:15] <runvnc> same to you
[23:29:41] <Gazpacho> NUTS
