[13:53:01] <jcgivens21_> Hello all. I have two select dropdown boxes. The second box should update (filter) itself based on the the selection from the first box. ...I can't get the code to work. Would anyone be willing to look at what I have and make a recommendation? Thanks. https://jsfiddle.net/jcgivens21/sya3f88q/#&togetherjs=EDs82qleeq
[14:04:16] <taplar> seems to work, once you include jquery in that fiddle
[14:05:54] <jcgivens21_> taplar: You added it to the External Resources?
[14:06:13] <taplar> no, click the javascript label on the bottom left window for options
[14:08:59] <jcgivens21_> taplar: Thanks
[14:11:07] <packweb> hi
[14:11:32] <packweb> I want to toggle the class of a list element in a list to 'on' but all the others to 'off'
[14:11:42] <packweb> I could of course just loop over all list items and toggle them all off first
[14:11:48] <packweb> then toggling the one to be enabled on again
[14:12:02] <packweb> but - wouldn't this cause the browser to draw twice (in case there are two frames)? :)
[14:12:49] <taplar> is the one you are turning 'on' already on?
[14:15:16] <packweb> taplar: no, but there is another one 'on'
[14:15:26] <packweb> so for example, there are e.g. 4x items in a list, one is already on
[14:15:34] <packweb> I want to turn on another item and the other item should be turned off
[14:15:47] <packweb> I want this as simple as possible, no extra variable for holding the currently on item
[14:15:49] <taplar> then unless you go out of your way to prevent it, there will be two draws regardless
[14:16:00] <taplar> but 2 draws is hardly a heavy operation
[14:16:11] <packweb> taplar: so premature optimization, rihgt? :D
[14:16:12] <packweb> ok
[14:16:16] <taplar> yup
[14:16:18] <packweb> so just a loop for turning off and one for turnign on
[14:16:19] <packweb> ok
[14:16:21] <taplar> no
[14:16:31] <taplar> i assume your in an event handler for the one to be turned on?
[14:17:48] <taplar> if so you can do $listOfThings.not(this).removeClass('on');  $(this).addClass('on');
[14:17:51] <taplar> or whatever
[14:19:02] <taplar> if all you are doing is adding/removing classes or some jQuery operation, you don't have to loop yourself.  most jQuery methods on jQuery.fn will loop over the internal result stack they hav
[15:18:45] <hilltop> Hi everyone. Is this a good spot for questions about bootstrap tab issues?

[17:18:25] <kraut> hoi
[17:18:33] <kraut> i'm struggling with formData. i've got a simple file upload page with a input box where i want to use that input value in php so i use ajax and formData with formData.append to use the file data and append it with the value: http://pastebin.com/dx4f1wCR
[17:24:16] <shoky> kraut: if you use formdata then the parameters are not send as classic POST params, it is a multipart request body - $_POST won't work for it, you need to see how to parse multipart/form-data request in php
[17:25:35] <shoky> kraut: also not sure what `this` is that you pass both to FormData()  and as the 'nickname' ...
[17:25:58] <shoky> also you didn't say what your problem is.
[17:26:44] <kraut> this is just a matching on filetypes more or less
[17:26:59] <kraut> shoky, problem is this: https://dreamland.netzdeponie.de/~kraut/test/bootstrap/html2/
[17:27:20] <kraut> i want the input filed with nickname passed to the upload php script so i can use that var there
[17:28:20] <kraut> s/filed/field
[17:28:57] <kraut> shoky, i was unable to parse the file and the val to php with data: formData, nickname, f.e.
[17:29:21] <shoky> kraut: you're not appending the nickname though
[17:29:40] <shoky> kraut:  and you have  a syntax error now
[17:29:49] <shoky> data: formData, nickname,
[17:29:54] <shoky> well not a syntax error, but that's wrong
[17:30:05] <kraut> i can't see any syntax eror?
[17:30:10] <kraut> oh, wait
[17:30:16] <shoky> kraut: also wut.. var nickname = nickname;
[17:30:37] <kraut> yes, that's wrong
[17:30:49] <shoky> kraut: now you're doing  formData.append('nickname',this);
[17:30:52] <shoky> why  `this`?
[17:30:57] <kraut> waaait please :)
[17:30:58] <shoky> that's the form.. not the nickname
[17:31:02] <shoky> k
[17:31:32] <kraut> so, please refresh
[17:31:42] <shoky> kraut: and as for parsing it in php.. ask php people :)
[17:31:43] <kraut>     var formData = new FormData(this);
[17:31:43] <kraut>     formData.append('nickname',this);
[17:31:56] <shoky> kraut:  `this` is the form. it's NOT the nickanme.
[17:32:01] <kraut> that's what i understood so long using formData.append
[17:32:12] <shoky> kraut: you want to append the nickname, not the form..
[17:32:26] <shoky> var nickname = $('#nickname').val();
[17:32:34] <shoky> formData.append('nickname', nickname);
[17:32:44] <kraut> oh
[17:32:57] <shoky> kraut: or actually.. if your <input> was inside the form
[17:33:08] <shoky> kraut: then you wouldn't need to add the nickname yourself
[17:33:24] <shoky> (and if it had name="nickname")
[17:33:56] <kraut>     var nickname = $('#nickname').val();
[17:33:56] <kraut>     var formData = new FormData(this);
[17:33:56] <kraut>     formData.append('nickname', nickname);
[17:34:03] <kraut> is the second line correct?
[17:34:11] <shoky> yes
[17:35:14] <kraut> woot
[17:35:22] <kraut> i got the var in php
[17:35:27] <kraut> shoky, thanks so much!
[17:35:32] <shoky> yw
[17:35:49] <kraut> now i think i understood the formData.append logic
[17:36:51] <verax5> yo
[17:36:54] <verax5> anyone uses vue?
[17:37:51] <packweb> hi again
[18:13:05] <z1haze> Im trying to parse a json string into an object but the string has raw html code in it, and its giving errors, at least i think thats why its giving the errors
[18:50:13] <shoky> z1haze: not enough details, ob
[18:50:14] <shoky> obv
[18:50:46] <duch_kazatel> obvs
[18:51:00] <z1haze> i had figured it out thank you though
[19:16:43] <szeb> hello guys
[19:17:17] <duch_kazatel> hello!
[19:33:15] <duch_kazatel> well that was fun
[23:18:13] <Darmani> Hi guys! I have a fiddle that looks like this.
[23:18:14] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/
[23:18:38] <Darmani> It's supposed to check if at least one checkbox is checked but it's not working :[
[23:29:21] <Darmani> Sorry it's a little off
[23:29:21] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/2/
[23:29:50] <Darmani> So this example is a little better, if anyone has any suggestions I'd appreciate it!
[23:42:45] <solice> the click event is not rubbing because the button needs a class
[23:42:45] <solice> <button class="mybtn">Check Boxes!</button>
[23:42:54] <solice> *running
[23:43:29] <solice> also instead on using an alert try using a console.log
[23:43:42] <solice> console.log("Please check one or more boxes.")
[23:46:42] <Darmani> solice: https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/3/
[23:46:57] <Darmani> I need to check at least one checkbox from each "group" is checked.
[23:53:06] <Darmani> Ah okay I got it to kind of work...
[23:53:07] <Darmani> https://jsfiddle.net/1vf1ug49/4/
[23:53:33] <Darmani> I need to make sure at least one is checked from each row though. Not just that one checkbox is checked...
