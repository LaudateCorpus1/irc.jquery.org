[00:48:43] <n0r> o hi /jquery/
[00:49:43] <n0r> is there a way to transverse multiple first children in an element?
[00:50:10] <n0r> the trick is they don't have unique id's or classes : I
[01:04:14] <Whiskey> can jQuery select all CSS elements that match something? Or do you select them in id/class one by one?
[01:47:38] <bigLanky> I am using this page for reference: http://assetrover.com/project/properties-2/14529-Single-family-For-sale-1829-B-AVE-Cedar-Rapids-Iowa-3Bedrooms-1Bathroom-USD69950/ <--- What I want to be able to do is send an email that has property information and one of the property images
[01:48:11] <bigLanky> on each property, there is an image slideshow, I just want to grab the first image and grab the src for that
[02:00:08] <durwasa> LindsayMac, ok thanks :)
[02:49:36] <thijnlinders> goodmorning
[02:49:43] <thijnlinders> i have a question
[04:44:01] <Duikb00t> Morning
[04:53:15] <thijn> how can you have 2 onclick funtions on one button?
[04:58:25] <Kartagis> thijn: what will these do?

[04:59:51] <lintguy> I have an issue, I'm trying to update content using .ajax method and it works fine on the current page with the same content as another page and in the response i see the HTML, but i can't parse the content - i only get nothing. I have forced set dataType html and contenType to html
[05:01:52] <lintguy> Even the preview in chrome shows the html, yet i can't parse it
[05:01:56] <lintguy> what is going on?
[05:02:36] <lintguy> I've never needed to have jquery on the page i'm fetching before, so can't be that can it ?
[05:13:10] <thijn> i tried it with this code http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Vi8Vc4rBer
[05:13:58] <thijn> lol it works
[05:42:36] <lintguy> Nevermind, i was just silly
[05:54:11] <jop008> I have a select in jquery mobile the first option is shown always how to avoid this? http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2015-10-13_at_11.52.00-uAaM4S8c.png

[06:39:13] <grimgrinn> hi guys
[06:39:19] <grimgrinn> kindly need help
[06:41:17] <grimgrinn> i have two scripts on the page, both sending ajax post query but to different files. one of them have .done parametr. and everything looks like working but when second scripts fires up - .done commands of first script working . it doesnt right. how to fix it?
[06:43:53] <Kartagis> `testcase
[06:43:58] <Kartagis> gah
[06:44:15] <Kartagis> paste it on jsfiddle.net
[06:44:18] <Uhkis> ?demo
[06:44:19] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[06:53:03] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/77jpxp1y/ how can I make it so that I send checkbox values in the post request?
[06:56:04] <grimgrinn> http://jsfiddle.net/7spsvzcx/
[06:57:08] <Cork> Kartagis: the simplest is to add the hidden field suppose to follow with a checkbox
[06:57:14] <Cork> Kartagis: and then just use serialize()
[06:58:07] <Cork> though if you don't provide an interface for changing the option later that isn't needed
[06:58:18] <arup_r> why $("table#share-management tr[data-id=7]").remove(); is working but not $("table#share-management").remove("tr[data-id=7]")
[06:58:40] <arup_r> I can pass selectors to the remove() function as per the doco.
[06:59:05] <Kartagis> Cork: I can't use serialize as is?
[06:59:23] <Cork> you can
[07:00:21] <Kartagis> should I remove the array pushing lines though?
[07:00:45] <grimgrinn> wait for your help guys
[07:00:57] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/77jpxp1y/1/
[07:01:02] <Cork> opps
[07:01:11] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/77jpxp1y/2/
[07:01:50] <Cork> arup_r: 1. don't put tag names infront of ids
[07:01:59] <Cork> arup_r: also .remove doesn't take a selector
[07:02:14] <arup_r> it does Cork https://api.jquery.com/remove/
[07:02:22] <arup_r> API doc is saying so
[07:02:26] <Cork> arup_r: ok, correction it doesn't do a find
[07:02:28] <Cork> it is a filter
[07:02:37] <Kartagis> I can't use data.push for all my elements, this was just one element
[07:02:49] <Cork> Kartagis: uh, what?
[07:02:56] <Cork> the push is for the statically added data
[07:03:03] <Cork> the first line is for the form
[07:03:07] <Kartagis> Cork: I have many more elements
[07:03:11] <arup_r> Cork: I didn't get you.
[07:03:16] <Cork> so include them in the selection
[07:03:21] <Ergo> hey guys, from http://127.0.0.1:5000/ im doing an ajax request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo - for some reason jquery is not issuing OPTIONS request for CORS, it looks like it actually starts listening for the response, but i never get the response from the endpoint
[07:03:32] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/sdg342hL/2/
[07:03:39] <Cork> arup_r: $('table').filter('tr') == nothing cause none of the tables match tr
[07:03:46] <Kartagis> this is my testcase
[07:03:56] <Cork> arup_r: $('table tr').filter('tr') would work though
[07:04:06] <Cork> and return all of the matched trs
[07:04:21] <arup_r> Ok so remove() works like a filter()
[07:04:26] <arup_r> ?
[07:04:33] <Cork> arup_r: yes
[07:04:37] <arup_r> let me try
[07:04:48] <Cork> "remove all elements in the match set that matches the selector"
[07:05:17] <Cork> arup_r: only find does traversal
[07:05:25] <arup_r> ok.
[07:05:27] <Cork> and $() (but that is a short hand for .find)
[07:06:07] <Ergo> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://127.0.0.1:8000/listen?conn_id=a36049b0-a286-495b-968b-b1fbf87aa4f4. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' is therefore not allowed access. - but the browser normally issues an OPTIONS request first right?
[07:06:23] <Cork> Ergo: option is only used for posts
[07:06:34] <arup_r> Cork: hum. Nice to know. You are right.
[07:06:40] <Cork> also it is the browser sending the OPTIONS not jquery
[07:07:15] <Cork> Ergo: so if your doing a post and the options call isn't sent, it means the browser doesn't support cors
[07:07:28] <Ergo> im doing a GET to another domain
[07:07:36] <Ergo> maybe i should switch to POST and see what happens
[07:07:39] <Cork> then options isn't suppose to be sent
[07:07:50] <Cork> the get response should include the headers
[07:08:01] <Cork> (if the server allows cross domain gets)
[07:08:18] <Ergo> its long polling, so the response takes a while
[07:08:28] <Cork> Ergo: only reason options is used for post is cause post is meant to change the data server side
[07:08:39] <Cork> so the browser has to know the server allows it BEFORE it makes the call
[07:08:55] <Cork> while for get calls it can just check the response before it gives it to the page
[07:09:06] <Cork> so it is enough if the info is in the response header
[07:09:13] <grimgrinn> anything about my case?
[07:09:17] <Ergo> Cork: well, its also to check for the Allow-Origin isint it?
[07:09:39] <Cork> Ergo: not really
[07:10:04] <Cork> Ergo: the check for the response is to see if the browser should provide the data to the page or drop it
[07:10:28] <Cork> Ergo: and if the connection times out it won't know and you most likely get the error
[07:10:50] <Cork> Ergo: i would say that is expected behavior
[07:11:26] <Cork> Ergo: if the data would never be reused (unique based on the data sent) then ya it should be a post
[07:11:48] <Cork> as posts are never cached
[07:11:59] <Cork> (while the options answer is)
[07:13:43] <grimgrinn> anyone?
[07:17:54] <Cork> grimgrinn: it is better to ask the question again instead of asking for a person
[07:18:17] <grimgrinn> i have two scripts on the page, both sending ajax post query but to different files. one of them have .done parametr. and everything looks like working but when second scripts fires up - .done commands of first script working . it doesnt right. how to fix it?
[07:18:47] <grimgrinn> http://jsfiddle.net/7spsvzcx/
[07:19:15] <Cork> grimgrinn: ajax is async so they don't wait for each other
[07:19:39] <Cork> if that is what your asking (hard to understand the question)
[07:19:47] <xec> grimgrinn: you can't have html in the javascript field, the top left part is for html
[07:20:01] <Cork> xec: but that would break the even attributes :)
[07:20:09] <Cork> *event
[07:20:15] <xec> that's what i'm aiming for :D
[07:20:20] <Cork> heh
[07:20:27] <xec> j/k
[07:20:36] <xec> but inline event handler is a bad idea(tm) anyway
[07:20:42] <Cork> ya
[07:20:56] <Cork> i don't have the time to do the rant right now though
[07:21:10] <taplar> you need a meme
[07:21:18] <taplar> or however it's spelled
[07:21:37] <Cork> you mean
[07:21:46] <Cork> "don't kill kittins, stop using dom0"
[07:21:59] <lumidee> hey! i want to send a post request with jquery when someone clicks on <a id="seen">. but i don't receive any jQuery post request yet. is my code fine? http://jsfiddle.net/t88czstr/
[07:22:00] <xec> lol
[07:22:30] <xec> grimgrinn: to reiterate Cork's sentiment; what exactly are you trying to do? it's hard to tell
[07:22:40] <Cork> lumidee: bind a fail handler
[07:22:49] <taplar> i was thinking a gif of a guy typing an inline event handler and as he finishes it, switch to an atomic bomb going off, then flash back to the guy with the whole smokey after bomb hair blown back face
[07:23:10] <Cork> taplar: heh
[07:23:25] <Ergo> Cork: found it, a mistake on my end, the server didnt return right headers :(
[07:26:33] <grimgrinn> what i tried to ask is - when i come to the page with this scripts - i have a button for popup window and a button where location calculating and send email. second one needs to be silent, but when i oush the button  - alert from firs script is fires
[07:28:09] <grimgrinn> how to avoid this?
[07:28:13] <lumidee> Cork, i added an ajax error funtion but it is not triggered. did i use the correct fail handler? if yes, does it mean i mean jquery is fine? http://jsfiddle.net/t88czstr/1/
[07:29:09] <taplar> mmm, just from the fiddle, $(this) is not a form
[07:29:31] <lumidee> oh yes
[07:30:23] <lumidee> but $form is just a variable name and i want to select the <a> object anyways
[07:30:36] <taplar> then change the name, it's confusing
[07:30:43] <lumidee> you're right
[07:31:10] <xec> grimgrinn: may be several things, but my guess is that the <button> is inside the #form ?
[07:31:33] <lumidee> http://jsfiddle.net/t88czstr/2/
[07:31:49] <xec> grimgrinn: the default action of a <button> inside a <form> is to submit the form (meaning $("#form").submit(handler) will trigger)
[07:32:02] <taplar> lumidee: also is there a reason your storing the post in a variable?
[07:32:44] <lumidee> there's isn't. i'll omit the variable part
[07:33:08] <taplar> just curious
[07:33:24] <lumidee> can i still use the .done function on the $post without it being a variable?
[07:33:31] <taplar> yep
[07:33:39] <taplar> otherwise your variable would not have worked
[07:34:09] <taplar> $.post(...).done(...).fail(...)
[07:36:11] <lumidee> http://jsfiddle.net/t88czstr/3/
[07:36:31] <taplar> so what does that do for you
[07:38:43] <lumidee> no alert popup for success nor fail and fail log within the <div>. :S
[07:38:55] <lumidee> *an no fail log
[07:39:19] <taplar> check your console, see if there are any errors
[07:46:19] <grimgrinn> xec thankyou! i just forgot to close first form teg! *facepalm*
[07:46:31] <lumidee> don't see anything in apache2 logs, nor in my django backend. i included: /static/jquery-1.6.4.min.js  , maybe i need to reference (jQuery) at the end of my function?
[07:47:01] <taplar> no, i mean your browser console.  see if there are any js errors that could be preventing your logic from running
[07:47:31] <taplar> you said you didn't see any of the alerts.  done or error should fire
[07:47:49] <lumidee> ah right, js runs in the user's browser! thanks for the hint. there's this error: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).click(...) is not a function
[07:48:13] <taplar> you are including jquery first, right?
[07:49:07] <lumidee> yes, i include : /static/jquery-1.6.4.min.js in my index.html template, at the top of my html: <script src="/static/jquery-1.6.4.min.js"></script>
[07:49:07] <lumidee> 	
[07:49:33] <taplar> and the logic that does the binding is after that?
[07:50:21] <lumidee> maybe i should add on. to it?  $( ".seen" ).on( 'click', function ( event )
[07:50:35] <taplar> click is a wrapper for that, both should work
[07:51:12] <lumidee> yes, the click function is at the bottom of my html
[07:52:13] <taplar> hmm for shiggles, do this before your bind: console.log( $('#seen').length );
[07:54:12] <lumidee> i think there's an error with my javascript code before. i see this in console now: .Uncaught TypeError: $(...).customSelect is not a function Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[07:54:12] <lumidee> 192.168.2.16/:22 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).customSelect is not a function
[07:54:42] <taplar> yep, fix any errors you see
[07:56:11] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/sdg342hL/3/ why am I getting 'node type is required" even though I am passing a node type?
[07:56:59] <taplar> what tha.... that doesn't look like json
[07:58:06] <Kartagis> taplar: my endpoint converts this to json,
[07:59:28] <taplar> i'm getting a cors from the fiddle, but the request does seem to be firing.  can't see your issue
[08:00:23] <Kartagis> if you look at console, a 406 is returned
[08:00:54] <taplar> 503 on my side
[08:01:09] <Kartagis> I don't understand why you are getting cors and I'm not
[08:01:19] <taplar> i'm not on your network?  *shrug*
[08:01:31] <Kartagis> jsfiddle.net ?
[08:01:57] <taplar> i'm on the site, but i'm not on your network.  might have something to do with it, dunno
[08:02:12] <Kartagis> let me make it *, one sec
[08:02:46] <Kartagis> weird
[08:02:46] <lumidee> ah the "missing ) " error was only triggered, because i replaced the click wrapper with .on. now there is no error in the console and console.log( $('#seen').length ); doesn't appear in console either or html
[08:02:55] <Kartagis> * is allowed
[08:03:23] <taplar> lumidee: the log of length isn't printing 0 or anything?
[08:03:31] <lumidee> ah i think it says length 1
[08:03:37] <lumidee> in the console
[08:03:49] <taplar> ok
[08:03:54] <taplar> still the error on the binding?
[08:03:59] <taplar> Kartagis: still got a 503
[08:04:01] <lumidee> no error on the binding anymore
[08:04:07] <taplar> k
[08:04:10] <Kartagis> one sec
[08:04:11] <lumidee> (after i replaced the wrapper)
[08:04:24] <lumidee> i include two different versions of jQuery, maybe that's bad?
[08:04:35] <taplar> uh, yeah, you only need one.
[08:04:58] <taplar> why do you need two?
[08:05:28] <lumidee> i include:   /static/mp/jquery.min.js  for magnific popup and /static/jquery-1.6.4.min.js for customselect (for customizing <select>)
[08:06:16] <lumidee> not sure if magnific popup specifically needs jQuery v2.1.3
[08:06:34] <lumidee> i'll try omitting 1.6.4
[08:07:46] <Kartagis> http://codepen.io/kartagis/pen/GpvwzR
[08:07:50] <Kartagis> taplar: ^
[08:08:32] <taplar> 503
[08:12:29] <lumidee> can i omit (jQuery) at the end of this other jQuery function: http://dpaste.com/2EN84SD
[08:13:12] <taplar> that would break that logic
[08:13:36] <taplar> lumidee: go to your /static/mp/jquery.min.js and see what it's version is
[08:13:50] <lumidee> it's v.2.1.3
[08:14:30] <taplar> and that version does not work with customselect?
[08:15:05] <lumidee> it works fine. i already removed the older one 1.6.4 :)
[08:15:14] <taplar> so there ya go
[08:15:42] <taplar> iirc the only difference between 2.* and 1.* is support for older IE versions
[08:16:00] <taplar> so if you need to support older IE, you'll want to find the 1.* equavalent to the 2.* one
[08:16:04] <lumidee> just not sure why my click event is not triggered at all, no error nor success message. maybe it's doing something just its not within done nor .fail routine
[08:16:48] <taplar> lumidee: you could put a console log in your click event before the ajax to see that it is firing
[08:16:51] <lumidee> i added .always and its not running too
[08:16:57] <lumidee> ok
[08:18:46] <lumidee> nope console.log within the click function is neither appearing: http://jsfiddle.net/t88czstr/4/
[08:19:25] <taplar> were is this binding at on the page?
[08:22:21] <lumidee> at the very bottom: here's a section of my html page: http://dpaste.com/00FK0TX
[08:23:40] <taplar> i don't see an element with seen as the id in the html
[08:25:54] <lumidee> ye i just pasted the bottom and top. the <a id="seen" ...> is in the middle of the html (cut off in the paste)
[08:27:13] <taplar> and the console of the length before the binding is printing 1?
[08:27:28] <lumidee> oh
[08:27:32] <lumidee> now an error appeared!
[08:28:09] <lumidee> but it appears only on the first <a id="seen"...> element! on all others it doesn't
[08:28:19] <taplar> uh
[08:28:26] <Cork> lumidee: ids are unique per page
[08:28:27] <taplar> what do you mean all others?
[08:28:35] <Cork> they can't repeat
[08:28:37] <taplar> ^
[08:28:38] <lumidee> i have multiple sections with multiple anchors
[08:28:43] <lumidee> aaah
[08:28:44] <Cork> (use a class)
[08:28:49] <taplar> X|
[08:31:42] <lumidee> thanks! now i get the error alert for all anchors :)
[08:31:53] <taplar> yay
[08:32:29] <Cork> little note the id is unique is quite a common mistake
[08:32:41] <Cork> so don't feel bad about it :)
[08:32:58] <lumidee> thanks ;)
[08:47:06] <taplar> the....final....countdown!!!
[08:47:11] <taplar> gah, i hate music bombing myself
[08:47:30] <xec> lol
[08:47:48] <xec> i read that while singing in my head
[08:47:59] <taplar> :D
[08:48:00] <xec> DUDUDUU DUU
[08:48:35] <taplar> i used to always music bomb a qa in my office with 8675309
[08:49:51] <Cork> xec: heh that sentence is special isn't it (i did the same XD)
[09:40:54] <jac0bz1> Perhaps not the right place, but, I'm looking for a script/app that allows for creating html content in an drag/drop way. like atomic.io. What ever it costs, i dont care. Today we use zedity.com but it's to bloated and large, and the interface is to "cartoonish".. Anyone that could point me in the right direction? Whatever search I do, I end up at some wordpress content builder..
[09:45:53] <hellyeah> hey do i need to change my code as using $.post instead of $.ajax what is personal opinion about that?
[09:47:29] <taplar> up to you
[09:47:35] <taplar> post is a wrapper for ajax
[09:48:06] <hellyeah> taplar any performance benefit because it is few lines of js code
[09:48:08] <hellyeah> ?
[09:48:18] <taplar> negligable
[09:49:09] <hellyeah> ic
[09:49:15] <Cork> it isn't any at all
[09:49:16] <hellyeah> like microsec or smt
[09:49:24] <Cork> it isn't any
[09:49:25] <hellyeah> macrosec may be
[09:49:28] <hellyeah> ic
[09:49:32] <Cork> the jit compilor will compile it away completely
[09:49:52] <hellyeah> so code is still there when you use post but you dont see it right
[09:50:09] <hellyeah> btw i managed to call method with parameters by using $.ajax
[09:50:12] <Cork> hellyeah: no jit creates machine code
[09:50:16] <Cork> it is what the browser runs
[09:50:19] <hellyeah> so it is one my happy day :D
[09:50:22] <Cork> it isn't an optimized js :)
[09:50:36] <Cork> hellyeah: this is the entirety of what post is http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.post
[09:50:49] <Cork> so an if case and then just an ajax call
[09:51:22] <Cork> you won't be able to even measure the cost of that one
[09:51:28] <hellyeah> btw fallback is executed if page return smt like 404 or 501 right
[09:51:45] <hellyeah> or error is executed
[09:51:51] <taplar> fail would be the 404 or 501
[09:52:00] <taplar> or you can explicitly give handlers for those codes
[09:52:04] <hellyeah> ajax has statuscode: also
[09:52:25] <hellyeah> right with statuscode:
[09:52:38] <hellyeah> so anyway what i need to understand i dont need $.post really
[09:52:55] <taplar> 'need', no
[09:52:59] <taplar> but it's available
[09:53:09] <taplar> depends which you find more readable
[09:53:29] <hellyeah> ah i understand the line here
[09:53:39] <hellyeah> i guess $.post make it less readable
[09:53:41] <taplar> there's no doubt which operation $post is/should be doing
[09:53:45] <taplar> no, more
[09:54:00] <hellyeah> gotcha
[09:54:45] <hellyeah> so
[09:55:10] <hellyeah> what is the benefit of using ajax when calling page or not using ajax when calling page? is there really a difference?
[09:55:28] <taplar> if you want to get information about part of a page without rebuilding the entire page
[09:55:41] <taplar> or if you want to perform some operation without rebuilding the page
[09:57:04] <hellyeah> so part of the page is refreshed
[09:57:09] <hellyeah> not the all html code
[09:57:14] <hellyeah> html code is still there
[09:57:15] <taplar> 'rebuilt'
[09:57:29] <hellyeah> so static htmlcode didnt rebuilt again
[09:57:33] <taplar> nope
[09:57:34] <hellyeah> did i understand true?
[09:57:38] <hellyeah> humm
[09:57:40] <taplar> yep
[09:58:00] <taplar> the page html is loaded into the dom, from there your just changing the dom
[09:58:42] <hellyeah> ic
[09:58:57] <hellyeah> then can we think like dom is dynamic content of the page?
[09:59:08] <taplar> dom 'is' the page
[09:59:19] <taplar> the page is the browser rendering of the dom
[10:00:01] <taplar> that's why you'll hear some people talk about page 'redraws'
[10:00:10] <taplar> which you want to limit if possible
[10:12:31] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:32:54] <_lazarevsky> hello all
[10:33:02] <_lazarevsky> I need help with bootstrap navbar
[10:33:10] <_lazarevsky> it's not really a jquery question per se
[10:33:27] <_lazarevsky> but people who work extensively with jquery tend to have experience working with bootstrap as well
[10:33:27] <_lazarevsky> thanks
[10:35:54] <taplar> _lazarevsky: ask your question and share your fiddle.  if someone can help they'll reply
[10:51:46] <lumidee> can i do a post with a form (instead of with jQuery) and then still get the return request with jQuery? maybe my attempt is already right or will $.post do a post request too? http://jsfiddle.net/0uqpaxzp/
[10:54:54] <taplar> $.post will do a post request
[10:55:08] <taplar> if you do a normal post request with a form, that is outside of javascript
[11:02:04] <lumidee> so the only way to get a return request within javascript is to do the post with javascript?
[11:02:35] <taplar> any ajax request should have the abilitiy to have a return result
[11:03:00] <paranduril> so, yes, you need to it with JS
[11:03:10] <taplar> outside of ajax, old style javascript used to do iframes to do stuff like that
[11:04:23] <lumidee> thanks for clarification! going to get it with jQuery done then.
[11:09:33] <rominronin> hi, I have a series of <img> tags, each with a src. I want to wrap each <img> with a <div>, and give it a background image equal to the src. How is this done using jquery?
[11:09:43] <rominronin> I have some syntax which simply isn’t working
[11:09:54] <rominronin> My jquery is clearly not the greatest
[11:10:24] <taplar> wrap with div or replace with div?
[11:11:13] <rominronin> replace could work too I guess, the important thing is extracting the src and turning it into a background image property
[11:11:19] <rominronin> the rest I can go in css :)
[11:11:56] <taplar> you could select them all, do an each on them and inside get the src prop, replace it with a div and set the background to the div
[11:13:56] <rominronin> taplar: I’m trying that. Unfortunately I’m not having much luck with the syntax
[11:14:10] <taplar> throw up a fiddle, lets see what cha got
[11:14:43] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/h5zd4pgq/
[11:15:03] <rominronin> i know my ‘this’ usage is terrible
[11:15:26] <rominronin> i know my variable and string handling are also both terrible
[11:15:30] <taplar> first your variable is 'slideImages' and your then doing $slideImages.each
[11:16:08] <rominronin> try
[11:16:08] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/h5zd4pgq/1/
[11:16:33] <taplar> same thing
[11:16:45] <rominronin> should I do slideImages.each instead?
[11:17:00] <taplar> or put the $ on the variable, either way that don't match
[11:17:06] <taplar> that = they
[11:18:11] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/h5zd4pgq/2/
[11:18:39] <rominronin> the next part is the source variable, i’m not sure how to convert it to a string
[11:18:45] <taplar> k, now your function declaration is wrong function({}) is not valid
[11:19:12] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/h5zd4pgq/3/
[11:19:35] <rominronin> function(){ stuff }?
[11:19:39] <taplar> now, $this isn't defined.
[11:20:05] <rominronin> (function(this){ code });
[11:20:08] <rominronin> ?
[11:20:20] <taplar> don't need to pass it in
[11:20:25] <taplar> var $this = $(this);
[11:20:50] <rominronin> i dont know how to define this
[11:21:06] <taplar> you don't, it's automatically given to you when there is context to a function
[11:21:09] <rominronin> i know I want the function to operate in each image found
[11:21:46] <rominronin> >: now, $this isn't defined.
[11:22:02] <taplar> right so define it
[11:22:35] <taplar> 'this' is defined, '$this' is not yet
[11:22:52] <rominronin> ah, this is where i was confused
[11:22:56] <rominronin> $this = this
[11:22:57] <rominronin> ?
[11:23:02] <taplar> var $this = $(this);
[11:23:25] <taplar> are you familiar with the use of $ on a varaible?
[11:23:42] <rominronin> not exactly, i’m more jq hipster than jq coder
[11:23:53] <rominronin> php is more my thand
[11:23:55] <rominronin> g
[11:24:03] <taplar> ok, $ on a variable in js does nothing functionally
[11:24:25] <taplar> $name has no functional significance in the language from 'name'
[11:24:44] <taplar> programmers typically put $ on the front of a varaible is js to signify that the variable contains a jquery object
[11:24:58] <taplar> so that they know later they don't have to wrap it to use a jquery function on it
[11:25:10] <rominronin> an object in jq is a query result?
[11:25:26] <taplar> eh, depends on what you mean by query
[11:25:44] <taplar> a jquery object is typically the result of a dom lookup
[11:25:56] <rominronin> ok, in my particular snippet, I have queried all img tags inside .md-mainimg
[11:26:08] <rominronin> and called that $slideImages
[11:26:24] <taplar> yep, and then your doing an each on it, but each gives the base dom element to the function instead of the jquery wrapped version
[11:26:26] <rominronin> I want to parse some code for each of those images
[11:26:40] <taplar> so in order to do a jquery function on the element, you have to wrap it
[11:27:02] <rominronin> ok, i sort of get it.
[11:27:33] <rominronin> so  in the each i say eg: $wrapped = this?
[11:27:43] <taplar> $(this)
[11:27:44] <rominronin> var $wrapped = this
[11:27:46] <taplar> to wrap it
[11:27:58] <rominronin> var $wrapped = $(this)
[11:28:07] <taplar> $(selector||dom element) creates a jquery object wrapping the element(s)
[11:29:08] <rominronin> ok
[11:29:27] <rominronin> http://jsfiddle.net/rominronin/h5zd4pgq/4/
[11:30:37] <rominronin> ok, if that’s correct, then I just need to learn how to set the background-image of the new wrapper div from the img src
[11:32:58] <dumptruckman> hey all
[11:33:23] <dumptruckman> i'm trying to find a way to make this UI look good at any size without significantly changing the layout for large sizes
[11:33:23] <taplar> rominronin: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/h5zd4pgq/5/
[11:33:41] <dumptruckman> i'm considering setting a maximum window size but i'm really unsure how to incorporate this
[11:33:44] <dumptruckman> http://initiative.app.appery.io/
[11:34:01] <dumptruckman> if you make it smaller (less than 800x600 or so) it looks like what i want it to look like
[11:34:08] <dumptruckman> any bigger and it just looks wacky
[11:34:32] <sekyms> What is the correct syntax for this example?  https://gist.github.com/smykes/cd65eee4f65901be8076
[11:34:38] <dumptruckman> particularly, being too wide is the issue
[11:35:13] <rominronin> taplar: thanks, I’m just trying to get my head around why that works
[11:35:24] <taplar> sekyms: var $fooAndBar = $('.foo, .bar');
[11:35:30] <rindolf> sekyms: $foo is not a string.
[11:36:22] <sekyms> right but I don't want to write it that way taplar as the the definitions for $foo and $bar are not that simple
[11:36:43] <sekyms> they are            var $sel2 = container.find(".foo");
[11:36:46] <rominronin> taplar: OK, that’s smart - on line 6 you’re creating a new div, with the required background image right?
[11:36:57] <taplar> rominronin: yah
[11:36:58] <rominronin> that’s funky
[11:37:30] <dumptruckman> is there a way i can put my content in a box that has a max width/height so that when the window is expanded larger than that the box floats in the middle of the window but if it is smaller than that the box effectively disappears and the content scales down?
[11:37:40] <rominronin> taplar: new concept for me - to define a new div by ‘querying’ it
[11:37:55] <taplar> technically not a query there
[11:38:49] <rominronin> yes, sorry = my vocabulary is currently my own - until I learn more jq concepts and terminology
[11:39:06] <taplar> no worries
[11:39:14] <rominronin> thanks for the help, I’m off to put this in a project
[11:39:28] <rominronin> gimme a shout if you ever need help with drupal ;)
[11:41:09] <taplar> sekyms: you might could use some application of add() then
[11:42:09] <taplar> or just call animate on both of them individually, heh
[11:45:18] <sekyms> taplar: add should work you are right
[11:45:31] <sekyms> taplar: weird stuff would likely happen if i animated them individually
[11:45:41] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[11:45:49] <taplar> well techinally you are still animating them individually
[11:46:39] <taplar> having them in the jquery object just keeps you from doing the iteration yourself
[11:46:59] <sekyms> right, it makes me feel safer,that they are starting more or less at the same time :-p
[11:47:55] <duch_kazatel> sekyms they would be anyway
[11:48:05] <hhrruusstt> I have click handler bind to element and it triggered in chrome but it doesn't get triggered in firefox. Why?
[11:48:05] <duch_kazatel> jquery would to exactly the same thing you would - .each()
[11:48:13] <hhrruusstt> is there any special event in firefox
[11:48:37] <duch_kazatel> hhrruusstt nope - click events are pretty standard.  show us what you've got.
[11:48:43] <sekyms> point taken
[11:49:05] <sekyms> thanks ladies and gents
[11:50:03] <taplar> ladies in here?  snap!  *licks finger and runs over eyebrows*
[11:50:40] <duch_kazatel> ew
[11:50:51] <taplar> *snaps fingers* eeeeeehhhh!
[12:03:15] <rominronin> taplar:
[12:03:23] <rominronin> issue with the code
[12:03:35] <rominronin> it’s not actually assigning a bg image
[12:03:56] <taplar> it may not be 'backgroundImage'.
[12:03:57] <rominronin> doesn’t show up in the DOM inspector
[12:04:02] <LindsayMac> hmm someone mentioned me... dont know where yet..
[12:04:21] <linqs> hi guys, I made an app that uses a lot of jquery/react as a side project
[12:04:27] <linqs> i wonder if I could get some feedback on if its any good / useful?
[12:05:01] <taplar> ah, lol
[12:05:09] <taplar> $('myOjbect').css('background-image', 'url(' + imageUrl + ')');
[12:05:15] <taplar> duh
[12:05:20] <taplar> forgot about the url()
[12:05:31] <rominronin> ta
[12:06:02] <taplar> linqs: if it works and is responsive, it's good!
[12:06:10] <taplar> if you have specific questions, just ask
[12:06:13] <rominronin> taplar: YESS! it works
[12:06:14] <rominronin> :)
[12:06:18] <taplar> cool
[12:06:55] <linqs> thx taplar, naw i am just wondering if it is a tool that smart people / early adopters think has promise. not specifically about jquery so I think I'll hold back ;)
[12:06:59] <dumptruckman> is there a way i can put my content in a box that has a max width/height so that when the window is expanded larger than that the box floats in the middle of the window but if it is smaller than that the box effectively disappears and the content scales down?
[12:08:34] <dumptruckman> also... any idea why my border in the middle doesn't show up on the right side? http://initiative.app.appery.io/
[12:08:51] <dumptruckman> it's like it's being clipped
[12:10:42] <duch_kazatel> woah wat
[12:10:48] <duch_kazatel> what border?
[12:10:59] <dumptruckman> there's a 2 pixel border around the listview
[12:15:40] <duch_kazatel> that's a helluva site.
[12:15:59] <dumptruckman> >.>
[12:16:02] <dumptruckman> bad?
[12:16:06] <dumptruckman> it's my first try
[12:16:20] <dumptruckman> intended for viewing on mobile
[12:16:43] <duch_kazatel> a few things: you're linking us to an entire site - normally you want to give us a self-contained example for whatever specific problem you're having.
[12:17:39] <duch_kazatel> and your first question is kind of strange - why do you want to do that, instead of doing a responsive site?
[12:17:41] <dumptruckman> not sure how i'd do that
[12:18:12] <duch_kazatel> also: which specific border isn't showing for you?
[12:19:27] <dumptruckman> the border around the list view in the middle
[12:19:51] <dumptruckman> ahh
[12:19:58] <dumptruckman> box-sizing: border-box; fixes that
[12:20:46] <dumptruckman> anyway, as far as limiting the size
[12:21:11] <dumptruckman> i don't know if i can handle rearranging the whole thing based on size
[12:21:21] <duch_kazatel> why do you want to limit it though?
[12:21:32] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman: most people do that via css media queries
[12:21:35] <dumptruckman> the components become too stretched
[12:21:46] <dumptruckman> LindsayMac: i am unfamiliar with css media queries
[12:21:47] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[12:21:55] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  time to get familiar with them :)
[12:22:11] <duch_kazatel> you should use something lime media queries and/or bootsrap instead
[12:22:21] <dumptruckman> ooh
[12:22:25] <duch_kazatel> jquery mobile is good at building mobile sites.
[12:22:39] <dumptruckman> well, the main intention is use on mobile
[12:22:47] <dumptruckman> with the side effect of working on desktop
[12:22:52] <dumptruckman> it just doesn't look as good on desktop
[12:22:52] <duch_kazatel> right, so it works ;)
[12:22:56] <duch_kazatel> and it never will.
[12:23:06] <dumptruckman> unless i use media queries?
[12:23:07] <duch_kazatel> limiting its size is not a very good way to approach that problem.
[12:23:09] <LindsayMac> @media screen and (min-width: 1200px) { body > div { max-width: 1200px; } }
[12:23:11] <dumptruckman> and rearrange the whole thing?
[12:23:16] <duch_kazatel> media queries are apart of the solution, yyes.
[12:23:29] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman: ^ add that to your css and it will max width your container so it doesnt stretch past 1200px
[12:23:31] <duch_kazatel> but you're using a mobile framework to build this out.,
[12:23:44] <dumptruckman> hmm
[12:23:48] <duch_kazatel> so the desktop will never look totally "right"
[12:23:50] <LindsayMac> ^ and yea what duch_kazatel said
[12:23:55] <dumptruckman> ah
[12:24:04] <dumptruckman> i'm sure it could look better though
[12:24:12] <LindsayMac> why use a mobile frameqwork for a site you're building to work on desktop AND mobile
[12:24:27] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  not "looks" in terms of aesthetics.. functionality
[12:24:47] <duch_kazatel> ^ you're going to have to compromise somewhere
[12:24:54] <dumptruckman> well yes, the size does not lend well to functionality either
[12:25:08] <dumptruckman> that css doesn't seem to correct the issue
[12:25:12] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  you need to learn about building a responsive site...
[12:25:25] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman right, your issue is you want to build a responsive site without building a responsive site.
[12:25:33] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman: it was demo CSS.. you're going to have to make it work for your site
[12:25:39] <dumptruckman> ah
[12:25:57] <dumptruckman> i figured body > div would have
[12:26:07] <dumptruckman> i am a complete noob with js/jquery
[12:26:09] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  also i dont see it on your site
[12:26:15] <dumptruckman> i used appery to at least get my idea working
[12:26:17] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  so however you put it there, i dont see it
[12:26:24] <dumptruckman> it's not on the live site
[12:27:12] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  this is NOT for making a responsive site.. appery is for native apps
[12:27:43] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  if you want to build a responsive site you have to use their html5 tools
[12:28:13] <dumptruckman> i mean i get that it is intended for mobile
[12:28:38] <LindsayMac> So why are you trying to shoe horn it onto a desktop?
[12:29:08] <duch_kazatel> ^
[12:29:17] <duch_kazatel> my hammer sucks as a screwdriver.
[12:30:15] <dumptruckman> i'm just attempting to make it look/function slightly better with the limited amount of experience i have
[12:30:37] <dumptruckman> i used appery so i could produce _something_ rather than doing it all manually and very likely producing _nothing_
[12:30:37] <duch_kazatel> which is commendable!  but you're not really going to get what you want :)
[12:30:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's awesome!  like, right on - you should feel proud.
[12:31:24] <duch_kazatel> but you're getting up against the limitations of this system :)
[12:31:40] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  you might just have to come to terms that with limited experience comes limitations in what you can do. And when people with more experience tell you that this ISN'T the way to do something just go with it
[12:32:03] <duch_kazatel> right, but don't let that dissuade you.  be proud of what you've built :)
[12:33:29] <dumptruckman> i mean, it seems like you're saying there is a way to give a max size to this ui
[12:33:43] <dumptruckman> which would suffice until i can learn to do it the right way
[12:33:43] <duch_kazatel> sure, there's a way, but that's not really waht you want to do :)
[12:33:49] <dumptruckman> you're right
[12:34:16] <dumptruckman> it definitely feels like the wrong solution
[12:34:28] <dumptruckman> but i feel like it's better than nothing for the interim
[12:34:35] <duch_kazatel> actually, i'd disagree.
[12:34:47] <duch_kazatel> a big ugly ui is better than constraining it artificially imo.
[12:34:54] <dumptruckman> hmm
[12:35:56] <dumptruckman> but it's also less functional at that size
[12:36:01] <duch_kazatel> i disagree.
[12:36:05] <duch_kazatel> plenty functional.
[12:36:14] <duch_kazatel> the end user can resize their screen to make it work.
[12:36:53] <duch_kazatel> if you're really set on making this do what you're saying (which is counterproductive, even if it's a case of "just learning"), you need max-width
[12:38:14] <dumptruckman> well, that's what i figured too
[12:38:16] <dumptruckman> it's just not working
[12:38:21] <duch_kazatel> it's unemployed?
[12:38:22] <dumptruckman> so appery is probably doing something weird
[12:38:28] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, show us ;)
[12:38:35] <dumptruckman> max-width on the cotent frame
[12:38:36] <dumptruckman> content
[12:38:46] <duch_kazatel> link.
[12:38:47] <duch_kazatel> pls
[12:38:59] <duch_kazatel> i haven't left your thing open :)
[12:39:42] <lumidee> how do i get value from the input with name='csrfmiddlewaretoken'. My attempt: http://jsfiddle.net/ezw2g9jq/
[12:40:05] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the window in that context.
[12:40:25] <duch_kazatel> avoid selecting using attributes - use classes and IDs.
[12:40:34] <duch_kazatel> and use .val() :)
[12:42:45] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ezw2g9jq/1/ lumidee
[12:43:15] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman: is this what you're trying to achieve http://cl.ly/image/1p0g112w3a1L
[12:45:05] <lumidee> duch_kazatel, i need to do it with name and not class, because the input element is autogenerated by my template
[12:45:13] <duch_kazatel> that's gross.
[12:45:18] <LindsayMac> lumidee:  change your template
[12:45:22] <LindsayMac> its that easy
[12:45:45] <duch_kazatel> Lindrian LOL you realize sometimes people don't have access to things like that, right?
[12:45:55] <duch_kazatel> err, LindsayMac
[12:46:13] <LindsayMac> I guess.. but i've also found people don't even think about doing that as well..
[12:46:32] <duch_kazatel> there's a way to suggest that idea without making it seem like they HAVE to ;)
[12:47:21] <duch_kazatel> you can make it work, but there are absolutely better ways.
[12:47:40] <dumptruckman> LindsayMac: nah, i meant the whole page
[12:47:47] <lumidee> i'd have to get the current $anchor object and not the window
[12:47:58] <dumptruckman> i'm fiddling with the css in inspect mode
[12:48:09] <duch_kazatel> lumidee make a more complete example then.
[12:48:36] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  not going to happen because the platform has some weird overflow: visible and position fixed
[12:50:02] <lumidee> http://jsfiddle.net/3pey2c26/
[12:50:44] <lumidee> if     var $anchor = $(this),    is the window and not the anchor element, then i dont understand why   rate = $anchor.attr("rate");   works
[12:50:45] <duch_kazatel> lumidee so the smart way to do this is to grab the form with .closest() and then find all relevant elements using .find() off of thjat.
[12:50:58] <duch_kazatel> and that was given the code you showed earlier.
[12:51:11] <lumidee> ah i see
[12:51:19] <duch_kazatel> the 'this' object in that case was the window object.
[12:57:07] <lumidee> hm i dont manage to grab the form http://dpaste.com/234ZT3K
[12:57:15] <duch_kazatel> where'
[12:57:20] <duch_kazatel> *where'd the fiddle go?
[12:57:40] <dumptruckman> LindsayMac: ahh.. that's what i was afraid of
[12:58:08] <duch_kazatel> lumidee you want to grab the form.
[12:58:38] <duch_kazatel> and btw - .attr('movie_id'), this is bad.
[12:59:00] <lumidee> tried to grab the form like so:     form = $anchor.closest("form"),    within $var anchor
[12:59:07] <duch_kazatel> "within"?
[12:59:40] <lumidee> yea:  var $anchor = $(this), form = $anchor.closest("form");
[12:59:50] <duch_kazatel> that's not "within" :)
[13:00:38] <lumidee> ah it's more like a notation for multiple variables?
[13:00:47] <duch_kazatel> what is?
[13:00:51] <duch_kazatel> the comma?
[13:00:53] <lumidee> the 'comma'
[13:00:53] <lumidee> yea
[13:00:57] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3pey2c26/1/
[13:00:59] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:01:07] <duch_kazatel> makes it so you don't have to keep using the var keyword
[13:02:04] <duch_kazatel> and you can't really "create" attributes btw.
[13:02:12] <duch_kazatel> you need to use data attributes of you want to store data like that.
[13:04:31] <lumidee> section is a parent of form though and i have multiple sections :) http://dpaste.com/0JQ80SP
[13:04:42] <duch_kazatel> fiddle please
[13:05:00] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, you can't define your own attributes.
[13:06:01] <lumidee> those are the data attr you're referring to?: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp
[13:06:25] <duch_kazatel> don't use w3schools - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes
[13:06:33] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:06:47] <duch_kazatel> data-movie-id etc.
[13:06:59] <lumidee> ah, good to know that, thanks!
[13:07:46] <duch_kazatel> and while you're fixing your templating system, fix that classname issue from earlier ;)(
[13:09:11] <LindsayMac> :)
[13:10:07] <lumidee> that could take me longer. i'd have to figure out how i can subclass the default django template tag {% csrf_token %}, but i'll do that later too :)
[13:10:16] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[13:10:23] <duch_kazatel> that means it'll never get done.
[13:10:26] <duch_kazatel> ;)that
[13:10:31] <duch_kazatel> *but okay
[13:17:24] <dumptruckman> huh
[13:17:32] <dumptruckman> any idea what the term "user agent stylesheet" refers to?
[13:17:41] <duch_kazatel> your browser's default styles.
[13:17:55] <dumptruckman> ah
[13:18:53] <LindsayMac> dumptruckman:  the user agent is the software acting on behalf of a user..
[13:19:05] <LindsayMac> https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent
[13:19:30] <dumptruckman> yeah
[13:19:45] <dumptruckman> kinda figured
[13:20:04] <dumptruckman> okay well
[13:20:13] <dumptruckman> i guess i'll just leave it as is until i learn a better way
[13:20:22] <dumptruckman> RWD approach
[13:22:43] <dumptruckman> i feel like i have a much better chances of building a site from scratch now
[13:23:16] <dumptruckman> or rather, with some kind of RWD framework
[13:23:41] <dumptruckman> any recommendations for a beginner?
[13:23:48] <lumidee> i changed my data attributes to the correct "data-" notation, but i couldn't get the values with prop(), only after replacing with attr() i could get the values: http://jsfiddle.net/cp8nunz1/
[13:23:49] <duch_kazatel> bootstrap.
[13:24:00] <dumptruckman> i was thinking probably bootstrap heh
[13:24:05] <duch_kazatel> lumidee i linked you to another page about that ;)
[13:24:07] <duch_kazatel> you use .data()
[13:24:20] <duch_kazatel> .data('username')
[13:24:25] <duch_kazatel> .data('rate')
[13:31:38] <hydraidm801> is there a reason I should ever use a shortcut method like .get() rather than .ajax() ?
[13:32:20] <Uhkis> when you feel like writing less
[13:33:59] <dumptruckman> anyone use webstorm for boostrap development?
[13:34:08] <dumptruckman> bootstrap even
[13:40:18] <lumidee> i tried .dataset.movieid and .data('movieid'), but both dont find movieid http://jsfiddle.net/cp8nunz1/1/
[13:41:31] <decx> dataset is a property of the vanilla element not the jquery object
[13:42:28] <lumidee> hm, then with data() http://jsfiddle.net/cp8nunz1/2/
[13:42:44] <decx> no
[13:43:07] <decx> look at that again closely
[13:43:13] <lumidee> yea i know i forgot '
[13:43:32] <lumidee> or did you mean something else?
[13:44:11] <decx> no jquery added, data keys missing ', one dataset.data
[13:45:28] <lumidee> oh ye, the dataset made it not work. thank you!
[13:48:34] <taplar> anyone ever seen before in ff when setting the prop() it appends the url to the start of the value?  v1.11.1
[13:48:41] <taplar> chrome doesn't do it
[13:49:33] <duch_kazatel> taplar which prop?
[13:49:50] <duch_kazatel> and "appends to the start" is contradictory - do you mean "prepends"?
[13:49:57] <taplar> random prop( 'itemId', value )
[13:50:06] <taplar> sorry, prepend
[13:50:08] <duch_kazatel> that seems wrong.  i'd have to see it break.
[13:50:19] <taplar> hold on, i'll see if i can get a fiddle to reproduce
[13:50:33] <taplar> i thought it was a weird issue with my jasmine tests, but then the actual code did it
[13:52:14] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/9qgzyv9f/
[13:52:53] <duch_kazatel> so fwiw you can't invent properties for dom nodes.
[13:53:07] <taplar> so it needs to be a data
[13:53:15] <duch_kazatel> use data for stuff like that, yeah.
[13:53:24] <taplar> k, it's just weird that it works in chrome
[13:53:41] <taplar> *grumbles*  refactoring time
[13:53:58] <duch_kazatel> just means replacing .prop( with .data( in a few cases ;)
[13:54:13] <taplar> and lower casing my lookup
[13:54:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:54:43] <taplar> data doesn't really do the camel case
[13:54:53] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9qgzyv9f/1/
[13:54:56] <duch_kazatel> sure it does.
[13:55:28] <taplar> wth
[13:55:32] <dumptruckman> does @media screen override css blocks without it?
[13:55:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[13:55:49] <decx> data and camelcase is a bit weird
[13:55:57] <duch_kazatel> yeah with the attributes.
[13:56:00] <dumptruckman> like
[13:56:07] <decx> in a dataset blah-this becomes blahThis for example
[13:56:15] <taplar> ah
[13:56:15] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/9qgzyv9f/2/
[13:56:22] <taplar> only if it was already in the markup
[13:56:41] <taplar> so i just lowercase my data and forget it
[13:57:10] <dumptruckman> @media screen and (min-wdith: 600px) .someclass { padding-right: 50px; } .someclass { padding-right: 20px; }
[13:57:28] <duch_kazatel> dumptruckman still not making sense.
[14:00:39] <dumptruckman> how does inheritance/overriding work
[14:00:48] <duch_kazatel> for media queries?
[14:01:27] <decx> ##css
[14:01:47] <duch_kazatel> anything in the media query is applied.
[15:45:41] <claytonzaugg> is there a way to get a <video> to play inline on iphones instead of making it load the fullscreen video player?
[15:48:43] <Lost123> hi i cannot make the sublings hide on change http://jsfiddle.net/7wdehuo7/25/
[15:48:55] <Lost123> the last line of function does not work, any help?
[15:49:46] <duch_kazatel> $('span').siblings.css("display", "none"); is not a thing.
[15:49:51] <duch_kazatel> .siblings() is.
[15:51:46] <Lost123> so what to change?
[15:51:49] <Lost123> duch_kazatel:
[15:52:09] <duch_kazatel> .siblings - .siblings()
[16:00:50] <claytonzaugg> is there a way to get a <video> to play inline on iphones instead of making it load the fullscreen video player?
[16:09:04] <LindsayMac> claytonzaugg:  nope
[16:10:09] <LindsayMac> claytonzaugg:  some people have tried to hacky-it together but not really successful
[16:10:16] <claytonzaugg> Unbelievable! Why in the world is this?
[16:10:25] <claytonzaugg> Or what is Apples justification for doing that?
[16:10:53] <derstrom> claytonzaugg: because the screen on a phone is small
[16:11:52] <LindsayMac> claytonzaugg: theres a few reasons... one i believe is they dont want autoplay.. another is that its a SUPER small video if it's inline
[16:11:53] <claytonzaugg> derstrom, that may be, but the developer should be able to choose if a certain video should be fullscreen or if it's okay to just play.  I mean for crying out loud, I can do an animated GIF, but those are huge!
[16:11:55] <LindsayMac> (usually)
[16:12:19] <LindsayMac> claytonzaugg: I usually use an animated gif for those things TBH
[16:12:25] <duch_kazatel> claytonzaugg nobody said any of this makes sense ;)
[16:12:30] <duch_kazatel> welcome to web development
[16:12:31] <claytonzaugg> LOL
[16:12:45] <duch_kazatel> and it's less about the image and more about the sound.
[16:13:18] <derstrom> claytonzaugg: It's a pain for developers I can understand, but it is what it is. It's up to Apple as to whether or not they want to change the current behaviour on iPhones and iPod touches.
[16:13:33] <claytonzaugg> I'm trying to avoid using an animated GIF because it's so freaking huge, but instead use an mp4 file since it's lighter and just as effective.
[16:13:47] <derstrom> You could perhaps send feedback to Apple, but I doubt they will do anything :-)
[16:15:00] <derstrom> claytonzaugg: Well you might want to also consider some people might not want a large video being downloaded without playing the video first, especially if they're browsing your website over a mobile network.
[16:15:13] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:15:19] <duch_kazatel> what is this video?
[16:15:22] <derstrom> (File size, is what I am referring to)
[16:21:11] <LindsayMac> claytonzaugg:  what is the purpose of the video?
[16:21:25] <LindsayMac> i feel like Apple forces devs /designers to think about the weight of the overall UI they are supplying...
[16:21:43] <LindsayMac> is the video actually superfluous ? something to think about
[16:21:49] <LindsayMac> while "cool" does it actually add any value?
[16:23:20] <lordjancso> is there any easy way to manipulate browser url?
[16:23:34] <LindsayMac> lordjancso:  pushstate ?
[16:23:39] <lordjancso> i have multiple get variables, and i would like to change only one with history.pushState
[16:24:37] <lordjancso> LindsayMac so i have this url: domain.com/first/second?a=1&b=2&c=3
[16:24:52] <lordjancso> and i would like to change b to 5
[16:24:59] <lordjancso> and dont modify the rest
[16:25:34] <LindsayMac> lordjancso:  and you can't replace the WHOLE thing with all same values except for the one ?
[16:25:53] <LindsayMac> like send a=1&5=2&c=3 ?
[16:26:30] <Velveeta> sounds to me like you should have some model tracking the state of those variables, and just serialize it whenever you need to modify one and change the url accordingly
[16:26:31] <LindsayMac> lordjancso:  also, why change a key and not a value? (ie: why change a->b and not 2->9)
[16:26:32] <lordjancso> LindsayMac sure i can, but then i have to write a wrapper around this url manipulation on my own
[16:26:55] <lordjancso> LindsayMac sorry i meant to change B's value to 5
[16:27:14] <LindsayMac> lordjancso:  whatever.. you're still changing a KEY and not a VALUE
[16:27:16] <LindsayMac> that is odd
[16:27:36] <LindsayMac> Oh wait is ee
[16:27:37] <LindsayMac> see
[16:27:43] <lordjancso> LindsayMac i'm changing the value, not the key :)
[16:27:45] <LindsayMac> i read the last sentance wrong .. ok
[16:27:52] <lordjancso> but not thats the point
[16:28:38] <LindsayMac> lordjancso:  well it kind of is.. you want to update the value of one key when you have a url with multiple key/value pairs
[16:28:53] <lordjancso> LindsayMac exactly
[16:29:03] <duch_kazatel> you could convert it to an object and update that key, then reconstruct the URL.
[16:29:06] <LindsayMac> lordjancso: replaceState.
[16:29:17] <duch_kazatel> ^ and use this.
[16:29:42] <duch_kazatel> as long as you don't care about old ie.
[16:29:43] <LindsayMac> history.replaceState({b: $N});
[16:29:53] <lordjancso> duch_kazatel: i know that, i'm just curious is there any complete library or something for this, or should i write all on my own
[16:30:04] <duch_kazatel> there are, but none of them are very good imo.
[16:30:25] <duch_kazatel> err, LindsayMac pretty sure that wouldn't work.
[16:30:45] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  ahh wait.. do you need to return the WHOLE thing...
[16:30:49] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:30:51] <lordjancso> duch_kazatel i'm sure too, replaceState first and second argument are useless here
[16:30:53] <duch_kazatel> and it takes at least two args.
[16:31:04] <LindsayMac> history.replaceState({a: 1, b: $N}, c: 3);
[16:31:10] <duch_kazatel> nonono.
[16:31:12] <LindsayMac> oops syntax error
[16:31:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  oh yea.. its not working code...
[16:31:43] <LindsayMac> i didnt google the specific args it takes... you'd want to include the nec. args.. i think path and title?
[16:31:56] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
[16:32:37] <duch_kazatel> state object and title aren't important - focus on that third arg.
[16:32:39] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[16:33:17] <LindsayMac> I think this has an example of what you want https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onpopstate
[16:33:36] <duch_kazatel> err. no.
[16:33:40] <LindsayMac> ok then..
[16:33:42] <LindsayMac> i'll stop
[16:33:49] <duch_kazatel> just read the link i sent :)
[16:33:57] <duch_kazatel> covers everything you need to know.
[16:45:28] <hydraidm801> what is the difference between .hide() and fadeToggle() ?
[16:46:42] <duch_kazatel> .hide() basically sets display: none;
[16:46:47] <duch_kazatel> fadeToggle() animates opacity.
[16:50:50] <hydraidm801> duch_kazatel, does fadeToggle() set display to none when the animation is completed?
[16:51:12] <duch_kazatel> easy enough to find out.
[16:51:35] <hydraidm801> that was a bonus question for you really
[16:51:38] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/fadetoggle/ - >The .fadeToggle() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. When called on a visible element, the element's display style property is set to none once the opacity reaches 0, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page.
[16:51:45] <duch_kazatel> pretty quick google search ;)
[16:51:57] <hydraidm801> gj
[16:52:01] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:52:43] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome?
[17:31:09] <durwasa> Can anyone please help me with the following code ? https://jsfiddle.net/durwasa/0ud0cu6o/1/ I am trying to echo the selection of radio button to the box ...
[17:39:36] <shoky_> durwasa: did you check your console?
[17:40:53] <durwasa> shoky_, sorry ?
[17:41:27] <durwasa> no i didnt mean that 'echo'
[17:41:29] <durwasa> :D
[17:42:03] <shoky_> durwasa: your browser has a javascript console, where you can see errors if there are any
[17:42:10] <shoky_> do you know it?
[17:42:44] <durwasa> shoky_, no I dont knw about it ...
[17:42:57] <shoky_> ok then it's important to learn about it
[17:43:02] <durwasa> :( shoky_ from where can i read about it ?
[17:43:16] <shoky_> one place with nice tips is
[17:43:18] <shoky_> ?ftj
[17:43:18] <b-ot> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[17:43:20] <shoky_> that ^
[17:43:30] <shoky_> but it might be a bit outdated
[17:43:40] <durwasa> control+shift+j
[17:44:05] <shoky_> yes, or F12 usually brings up the devtools
[17:44:14] <shoky_> and there you can cllick on console
[17:44:35] <shoky_> so on your jsfiddle i'm getting this error - Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[17:45:09] <shoky_> and after the error there is a link, when i click it shows me that the error came from line 6 in your jsfiddle
[17:45:13] <durwasa> shoky_, its ok i have started jquery its been two days so the stricter the norms i follow the better it would be for a longer run...
[17:45:37] <shoky_> try to find what im talking about and do that yourself, it's important to have this skill
[17:45:41] <shoky_> very
[17:46:02] <durwasa> shoky_, yes got it it is showing errors on my console ... thanks a ton :) :)
[17:46:08] <shoky_> cool :)
[17:50:45] <durwasa> shoky_, what is the number followed by colon like fiddle.jshell.net/:35 so what is 35 ?
[17:51:31] <shoky_> durwasa:  it means line 35 , but in jsfiddle it wont be the line number from your js code because jsfiddle puts some other stuff there
[17:51:59] <shoky_> on your own site it will show the actual line number.  but in any case you can probably click on it and it will take you to the exact line
[17:52:45] <shoky_> (and line 35 means that the error occured from code in that line)
[17:53:25] <durwasa> shoky_, okk ... so the 35 line of the code in the actual file of jsfiddle ???
[17:53:34] <shoky_> durwasa: yeap
[17:54:14] <shoky_> durwasa: you can right-click on the jsfiddle output frame, and do "view frame source"  and there you'll see the line 35
[17:54:53] <durwasa> shoky_, Also after the error has been resolved it says for the .change() that it is not a function ... But I jst read that .change() is a function in jQuery so how can I resolve that ?
[17:55:59] <shoky_> durwasa: update the fiddle and give me the new link
[17:56:56] <durwasa> sorrry sorry extremely sorry -_- really my Bad ! shoky_
[17:57:08] <shoky_> its ok ;]
[17:58:42] <pokergod> When using dragtable, and new rows come in via ajax.  What's the proper way to handle this?
[18:07:48] <shoky_> pokergod: i don't think it's meant for that.. don't think there is a proper way ;p  other than destroying/re-initializing i guess
[18:09:22] <pokergod> i want to be able to have my tables to be dragged/dropped into different layouts and have the data follow suit.  Know of anything?
[18:09:46] <shoky_> what do you mean by have the data follow suit?
[18:12:17] <pokergod> well, if someone drags the id column to another spot.. i want the ajax to follow
[18:12:32] <pokergod> the new data coming from the ajax success, to be posted in the correct order
[18:14:49] <shoky_> i might be wrong about what i said at first about dragtable
[18:15:12] <shoky_> seems it might read the table each time you drag, checking
[18:18:10] <durwasa> shoky_, sorry to interrupt but one more question ... I have a very small code of core javascript in a file say file.js and I want to add the last code snippet so can I add it to the same file or since its of jQuery I should save it in a different file ?? And I dnt want to go for the inline <script> tag
[18:18:36] <shoky_> pokergod: ok it seems it just works fine if you add rows to it http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/
[18:19:29] <shoky_> pokergod: so you've got that part covered. as for having new rows be with the right order, i think for that you need to persist the data (e.g. via an ajax post) to your server each time the columns are dragged
[18:19:48] <shoky_> pokergod: and they have examples of doing that on their demo page
[18:20:12] <pokergod> shoky, the problem exists when you persist to sessionStorage
[18:20:15] <pokergod> there is a flag, sec
[18:20:58] <shoky_> durwasa: jquery is just a javascript library. you can put jquery code in the same file if you want
[18:24:37] <pokergod> shaky, http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/1/
[18:24:47] <pokergod> like drag the TIME field to the right and reload
[18:26:03] <durwasa> shoky_, thnx :) :)
[18:28:44] <shoky_> pokergod: the <th>'s need to have id's
[18:29:05] <shoky_> pokergod: for that persist code, at least
[18:29:44] <shoky_> ugh why did they put an eval there :S
[18:32:07] <shoky_> pokergod: but you do know that the sessionStorage will get erased next time the user opens your site, yes ?
[18:32:20] <shoky_> they just gave it as an example
[18:42:09] <blindMoe> Has anyone ran into a problem with sticky kit that causes the sticky item to jump up to the top and not bottom out when the container is almost all the way up?  I scroll down and it works great until right before the end when it jumps up
[18:42:43] <blindMoe> or, does anyone have a suggestion for an alternative to sticky kit to just have a div stay on scroll until its parent element scrolls out of view?
[18:43:32] <blindMoe> *stay on screen
[18:44:35] <theskillwithin> blindMoe  position:  fixed
[18:45:30] <blindMoe> theskillwithin: yeah not looking to reinvent the wheel right now.. There is more that goes into it than just setting the position
[18:45:31] <theskillwithin> find the distance to top of document from the element,   then when you scroll that far + maybe enouph for it to be in the middle of the screen  then trigger on that action
[18:45:57] <theskillwithin> or something like that, maybe
[18:46:16] <blindMoe> hoping to find a plugin that works well in most browsers in mobile and implement it.  Would be fun to create my own plugin but I don't have time to test every scenario to ensure it works properly :/
[18:46:26] <theskillwithin> you would have to have a function that updates on every scroll though I think
[18:46:47] <theskillwithin> runs*
[18:48:04] <durwasa> shoky_, After testing the concept at jsfiddle I tried to scale it to my actual project which has the bootstrap jQuery CDN and the necessary glamour but there the same piece of code is not showing any results... Any specific area you would suggest from where I can start searching for my bug ?
[18:50:49] <pokergod> shoky, yes but i am using localStorage myself.. .with the id's on the headers
[18:51:01] <pokergod> and when it goes to insert the rows, they don't follow suit
[18:53:34] <pokergod> shoky, strange that I cannot get console.log to print : http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/3/
[18:53:45] <pokergod> I'd like to get localStorage to store the order of the table
[18:53:49] <pokergod> and have it update properly
[18:54:43] <abishek> I am using the rotatable library in jquery, its quite a basic question. When I rotate and element the top and the left changes. how do I calculate that?
[18:55:56] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  its logging for me
[18:56:11] <LindsayMac> pokergod: http://cl.ly/image/1M2y0L3y1K2Y
[18:57:49] <pokergod> LindsayMac, if you close the page and come back, the order remains how you dragged it?
[18:58:22] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  yep
[18:58:50] <pokergod> shoky_ and LindsayMac :  http://cl.ly/image/1M2y0L3y1K2Y   .. click run, the left column to the middle .. hit run again
[18:58:52] <pokergod> https://www.dropbox.com/s/hukt551w5e4j30w/Screenshot%202015-10-13%2016.58.44.png?dl=0
[18:59:00] <pokergod> I see the data gets out of order.. look at my screen shot...
[18:59:07] <pokergod> the date time is in the wrong column
[18:59:15] <LindsayMac> pokergod: http://cl.ly/412w102f3g2k
[18:59:30] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  I was just paying attention to the headers
[18:59:46] <pokergod> ah yeah you have the same issue, as i get
[18:59:50] <pokergod> how did you do that video
[19:00:16] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i use cloudapp screenshot app.. i LOVE it
[19:00:26] <LindsayMac> i THINK that you only get vid. on premium though
[19:00:57] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i dont see the issue though.. the whole column is moving
[19:01:26] <pokergod> look at the 16:11:11am column
[19:01:32] <pokergod> http://cl.ly/412w102f3g2k
[19:01:35] <LindsayMac> gimme link again
[19:01:36] <pokergod> look at the bottom row
[19:01:56] <pokergod> http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/3/
[19:02:11] <pokergod> the time gets inserted into the %idle column, instead of the TIME column.  It happened on your side, as well
[19:03:38] <pokergod> LindsayMac, do you see that?
[19:03:45] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  is it only with the bottom row? my brain cant retain all those cells without seeing the two side by side tbh
[19:04:47] <pokergod> LindsayMac, it's when any new data gets inserted into the table... mine gets inserted via ajax, but if you look to the left.. you can see that we insert that new row and before it persisted state, it worked.  When it recovers from localStorage, it messes up
[19:04:49] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  ok so basically the time on the bottom row ALWAYS wants to go to the first column no matter what
[19:05:01] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  do you rebind after  new data is added?
[19:05:04] <pokergod> yes, it goes out of order.  The new rows never follow?
[19:05:13] <pokergod> LindsayMac, i'm not sure what the fix is
[19:05:18] <pokergod> No, i'm not sure how to fix it
[19:05:25] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  it doesnt really go out of order.. it just goes to some default which is the first column in that row
[19:05:46] <pokergod> but if you don't persist state.. and add a new row, it 'follows' the column
[19:06:05] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  what do you mean if you don't persist state?
[19:06:20] <pokergod> localStorage
[19:06:29] <pokergod> it seems to only get affected with localStorage
[19:06:33] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  how does it work WITHOUT local storage?
[19:06:45] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i would imagine without local storage it wouldnt persist at all so how would you know?
[19:07:03] <pokergod> LindsayMac, what i mean...  when you drag the columns and new columns are coming in via ajax... and you don't reload the page.. the data goes into the correct columns
[19:07:07] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  also, it works if you dont have any rows added after the DOM is created, right?
[19:07:30] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  well that works with the persist state as well.. it only goes in the wrong column when you refresh
[19:07:53] <pokergod> So what is the approach to fix this?
[19:08:07] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  I need you to clarify those things
[19:09:08] <LindsayMac> you can't test this without localStorage because the problem happens only when you need the localStorage.. otherwise without localstorage.. with or without it added, both ways work the same.. you can drag and drop a column and everything is fine .
[19:09:16] <pokergod> I think it works properly from localStorage if the table data is there, before it runs
[19:09:19] <LindsayMac> the problem only happens when you refresh the page AFTER changing the columns
[19:09:46] <pokergod> ye
[19:09:47] <pokergod> yes
[19:09:50] <pokergod> you're right
[19:10:22] <shoky_> durwasa: check the console.. check that your jquery selectors are really finding something (you can check the .length of the jquery object),  make sure your code is in a $(document).ready function or at the end of <body>.. if you still dont find it, try more to reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle ;p
[19:10:22] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  so your issue is one of delegation.. the newly added rows arent seen by your code because the code runs on document.ready!
[19:10:24] <pokergod> I'm not sure how you fix this.  I googled this, and there were others that has the same issue, no response on how to fix it
[19:10:29] <LindsayMac> so how would it know it even exists if it's added after tht
[19:10:37] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i am telling you how
[19:11:03] <ngharo> pokergod: why dont you append before calling dragtable
[19:11:10] <ngharo> that seems to work just fine
[19:11:34] <pokergod> ngharo, the rows come in every 5 seconds...   so just call dragtable() again?
[19:11:36] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  i'm assuming that he's appending on some interaction on the page.. which was gonna be my next question
[19:11:48] <ngharo> oh i see
[19:11:50] <pokergod> it's just a static page, that updates every 5 seconds with more rows
[19:12:00] <pokergod> I figured that calling dragtable() was incorrect :)
[19:12:07] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  just add the draggable inside whatever it is that is doing the adding of rows
[19:12:29] <shoky_> pokergod  the problem is just with new rows, right?
[19:12:32] <pokergod> i see what you mea LindsayMac about the delegation...   code runs via document.ready... so I have to figure out how to best call draggable again without breaking things
[19:12:41] <pokergod> shoky, yes
[19:12:53] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  just do it on whatever script you have getting the other stuff every few sec.
[19:12:54] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  yea
[19:13:08] <pokergod> you can see it on: http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/3/   .. drag the TIME column to the 3rd column, and then reload the page
[19:13:19] <ngharo> i think i'd tag each TD with a class, then when appending a new row, clone one and replace the innertext
[19:13:21] <pokergod> or view LindsayMac 's video:   http://cl.ly/412w102f3g2k
[19:13:37] <shoky_> yeah i saw
[19:13:43] <LindsayMac> ngharo:  true.. if you clone you should be ok actually
[19:13:46] <LindsayMac> didn't even think of that.
[19:14:00] <LindsayMac> cloning maintains delegation, right?
[19:14:35] <pokergod> so wait, when it clones the row, I will look for the classes on each column and update via that way?
[19:14:54] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  you dont have to do anything aside from change .append to clone
[19:14:58] <LindsayMac> well i guess a little more
[19:15:01] <ngharo> it's just a thought since the ordering can't be relied on
[19:15:20] <LindsayMac> ah right.. ordering
[19:15:24] <LindsayMac> Just re-delegate it
[19:15:26] <pokergod> LindsayMac, how does that work?
[19:15:35] <LindsayMac> thats what i would probably do.. but I'm not a pro
[19:15:45] <pokergod> LindsayMac, relegate meaning, call  dragtable() again?
[19:16:02] <LindsayMac> yea
[19:16:28] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i would put the dragtable() inside of a function and call that function in your code that actually adds the table row
[19:17:31] <pokergod> i was concerned that calling dragtable, over and over was bad
[19:17:33] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/5zd3vwfm/7/
[19:18:09] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  I am pretty sure you're going to have to because you have to re-map all of the objects each time something is added because there's no associations to make..
[19:18:28] <LindsayMac> although I dont know the inner wrokings of dragtable but logic tells me they need to re-map anyways
[19:18:54] <pokergod> wow that actually works, i wonder how slow this gets when it gets to 200 rows!
[19:19:00] <pokergod> thank you, i will test this out!
[19:19:18] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  i dont think it would be that slow...
[19:21:11] <LindsayMac> pokergod:  their docs say something about maxMovingRows for large tables
[19:21:19] <LindsayMac> although actual details about how it works
[19:21:34] <shoky_> no that fiddle doesn't work, the row is added before dragtable initializes
[19:21:48] <shoky_> and you don't want to keep re-initializing the widget without destroying it first
[19:22:09] <shoky_> this is the first way i told you about, pokergod, destroy and re-initialize the widget each time ;p
[19:22:20] <LindsayMac> oops yea. forgot to destroy
[19:22:32] <LindsayMac> but why wont it work.. the row SHOULD be added before it's initialized, right?
[19:22:36] <LindsayMac> its just missing the destroy
[19:22:36] <shoky_> and you forgot to initialize it before adding the row
[19:22:56] <ngharo> here's what i was thinkin http://jsfiddle.net/5zd3vwfm/8/
[19:22:57] <shoky_> for it to work like pokergod wanted, you'd need to initialize before, AND after
[19:23:16] <shoky_> with destroying in between of course
[19:23:40] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  yea i guess if shows the table without appending to it first.. i didnt see the rest of the code so have no idea how it works
[19:24:01] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  how do you properly destroy eahc time? for my own reference
[19:24:59] <shoky_> .dragtable('destroy')  assuming the plugin destroys properly
[19:25:11] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  ah... hmmm...
[19:25:34] <LindsayMac> was just thinking in reference to one of my own projects where I have to constantly re-bind
[19:25:41] <shoky_> (it's totally dependent on how the plugin is coded, but this plugin is written as a jquery-ui widget and those have a "destroy" method)
[19:26:46] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  yep.. just checked... the one I'm using (select2) has a destroy..
[19:27:17] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  so if I re-bind on click of some DOM I would destroy FIRST and rebind second?
[19:28:30] <shoky_> LindsayMac:  if by re-bind you mean re-initialize the plugin instance, then yes.. the simple rule is: don't re-initialize without first destroying.
[19:28:48] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  yep... ok
[19:29:02] <LindsayMac> makes sense and would be the answer (most likely) to some of my weird glitches
[19:29:41] <shoky_> in general i'd rather use plugins that i wouldn't need to re-initialize
[19:29:56] <shoky_> if i need to re-initialize them because my data changed.. then it's probably not the right plugin
[19:30:12] <shoky_> and when you don't re-initialize at all, you have even less glitches :P
[19:30:29] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  how is it possible?
[19:30:49] <LindsayMac> to add elements to the DOM and not have whatever it is you're adding to the DOM elements know about it?
[19:30:54] <shoky_> many plugins have "refresh" methods to take in account new data
[19:31:01] <LindsayMac> Ahhh ok.
[19:31:09] <LindsayMac> yea select2 doesnt have that AFAIK
[19:31:21] <shoky_> yea, it just looks kinda nice :P
[19:31:43] <shoky_> (well no idea if it really doesnt have that feature.. just sayin)
[19:32:06] <LindsayMac> yea.. needed it for this project and it was a NIGHTMARE to deal with because of re-initializing stuff
[19:32:24] <LindsayMac> mostly because the stupid markup for the WP media modal is awfully programmed
[19:32:58] <shoky_> ;S
[19:33:13] <shoky_> pokergod: check ngharo's solution if you didn't see it
[19:33:37] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  i think the issue is that they weren't planning to see multiple dynamically added search fields appended to the dom regularly.
[19:33:45] <LindsayMac> i mean, my use case it probably pretty fringe..
[19:34:25] <LindsayMac> it can deal with new data added to the queryable data but not whole new fields as far as I can see
[19:34:39] <LindsayMac> I'll bring it up in the github repo though just to see what they say
[19:38:14] <shoky_> welp that's just my general preference, i'm not saying you shouldn't ever re-initialize, i'm sure i've done it myself for similar cases in the past ;p
[19:40:22] <LindsayMac> shoky_:  i'm gonna play around with the destroy method to see if I can figure something out that works
[19:44:58] <LindsayMac> crap//
[19:46:57] <shoky_> owie
[19:47:10] <LindsayMac> not sure i have my head wrapped around how im going to do this right now
[19:48:24] <LindsayMac> need to find a clear space where I can destroy the plugin after it's all done but before the other one loads
[19:49:02] <shoky_> sounds like a dirty setup
[19:49:56] <LindsayMac> shoky_: well I have to re-initialize every time I click a thumbnail to open that thumbnail's detail view.
[19:51:16] <LindsayMac> So I'm initializing .on('click') of the thumbnails so I would have to destroy AFTER the plugin is done being used on.('click') of the same thumbnails but inside of an area where I know isn;t fired unless the plugin is done...
[19:51:17] <LindsayMac> fuck
[19:51:26] <LindsayMac> as I'm typing it I know how bad it sounds
[20:07:13] <shoky_> didn't really understand.. jsfiddle would prolly help much
[20:09:01] <shoky_> but, if there's just one view with one selectbox, used for all thumbnails details,  you could just destroy right before re-initializing
[20:09:07] <shoky_> LindsayMac ^
[20:36:04] <pokergod> ngharo, wow that actually works!
