[00:00:12] <CaptainQuirk> Was wondering if the following is possible
[00:00:43] <CaptainQuirk> Make an ajax call to an apache server where a php script launches another script with system
[00:01:06] <CaptainQuirk> and display the progress of this second script interactively
[00:01:22] <CaptainQuirk> Is there anything that prevents it from the jquery side ?
[00:01:29] <Cork> no
[00:01:46] <Cork> interactiively won't work though
[00:01:56] <Cork> as you can't send data back from the ajax connection
[00:02:08] <Cork> or rather you will get the data when the connection is closed
[00:02:13] <CaptainQuirk> Cork, sorry about the terminology
[00:02:24] <CaptainQuirk> what I meant was, see the progress of the process
[00:02:29] <Cork> (this isn't a jquery limitation though, it is how the xhr object works)
[00:02:59] <CaptainQuirk> I'm using the $.ajax().done function for that
[00:03:06] <CaptainQuirk> is is the proper way to do it ?
[00:03:11] <Cork> see above
[00:03:32] <CaptainQuirk> you mean xhr object
[00:03:51] <Cork> i mean you can't stream data through xhr/ajax
[00:04:06] <CaptainQuirk> ok, that I don't know how
[00:04:09] <Cork> the data gets buffered and your later handed it in one go
[00:04:16] <coldhead> you're*
[00:04:58] <Gorakhpuriya> brunoais:  I am using with http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/37/
[00:05:51] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: you're defining load in onLoad
[00:05:58] <Cork> it isn't globally accessable
[00:06:12] <Cork> also you really shouldn't use inline event attributes
[00:06:53] <Cork> and when we're at it use <button type="button"></button> not <input type="submit">
[00:07:12] <Cork> (as you're not creating a submit button)
[00:10:06] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: After modification it is not load the content?
[00:10:31] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: please rephrase that
[00:12:30] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: refreshed pages in my local pc
[00:13:00] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: i don't follow what you mean at all
[00:13:17] <Cork> refreshed page in relation to what?
[00:13:39] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: It is not load the new page, I have also refreshed the page.. Whould you please show me a example if possible
[00:14:35] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/38/
[00:15:43] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/39/
[00:17:59] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Not load the content...
[00:18:49] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: I want to do like that http://bcbutler.com/ajax/ajax_load_method.php, but when I have implement in my local pc it is not loading the new page...
[00:18:55] <Cork> well if you get the exception you first talked about
[00:19:05] <Cork> it means the load function isn't defined so you can globally access it
[00:21:28] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Means when I click on button is will not load the new page content and also not give me a error?
[00:22:17] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: so you've gotten past the error you talked about before?
[00:22:52] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Please see this at once http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/45/ I have added this js
[00:23:10] <Cork> ok?
[00:23:21] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: 1. you have jquery loaded, why recreate it?
[00:23:39] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:
[00:23:39] <Cork> 2. you still haven't answered the question if you've fixed your original problem
[00:23:40] <Gorakhpuriya> http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/47/
[00:23:43] <Cork> ...
[00:23:49] <Cork> please answer 1 and 2
[00:24:15] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  No  I have not loaded the Jquery
[00:24:35] <Cork> ok and 2?
[00:25:16] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  NO
[00:26:52] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Are  you getting what I am saying?
[00:27:14] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork: Is I have used the wrong js http://jsfiddle.net/nrQWL/47/
[00:27:37] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: no i'm not
[00:27:43] <Cork> your contradiction your self
[00:27:55] <Cork> first you're saying you get errors
[00:27:59] <Cork> and then you say you don't
[00:28:26] <Cork> and when i'm asking if you've fixed the first error you say no
[00:28:32] <Cork> so... ???
[00:28:45] <Gorakhpuriya> Cork:  I am saying load function is not giving me any error, but also not load the new page... Are u getting?
[00:29:20] <Cork> Gorakhpuriya: so "<Gorakhpuriya> When I use the load, it is not load the an other page and give me "ReferenceError: load is not defined"??" never happened?
[00:30:30] <CaptainQuirk> Cork, I manage to get it working through xhr onreadystatechange
[00:30:37] <CaptainQuirk> however, the responseText is empty
[00:31:01] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: ya, cause you can't really do that
[00:31:11] <Cork> it isn't supported cross browsers to stream data over xhr
[00:31:16] <Cork> even with readystatechange
[00:31:27] <Cork> firefox have a half broken support
[00:31:33] <Cork> but they are the only one i know of
[00:31:44] <CaptainQuirk> ok, so I get everything but at the end
[00:31:56] <Cork> (firefox implementation keeps the buffer in memory so you get a memory baloon)
[00:32:03] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: exactly
[00:32:10] <CaptainQuirk> ok, so I leave it at that and try another solution
[00:32:14] <Cork> when the connection is closed the buffer is feed to you
[00:32:26] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: you could try websocket
[00:32:37] <CaptainQuirk> Nothing to do the server push
[00:32:50] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: never said it was :)
[00:33:09] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: but websocket has mutex
[00:33:11] <CaptainQuirk> no, I think I'll poll with a timer
[00:33:16] <Cork> so you can send data back as the connection is open
[00:33:27] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: prob the best option if your using php
[00:33:38] <Cork> has it doens't really work for socket connections
[00:33:54] <CaptainQuirk> you mean ajax timed polling ?
[00:34:38] <Cork> CaptainQuirk: no i meant websocket
[00:35:12] <Cork> as you can stream data over websocket it works nicely for this kind of things
[00:35:46] <CaptainQuirk> yes but I would need a websocket implementation server side
[00:36:09] <Cork> ya, and like i said it is a big missmatch for php
[00:36:19] <Cork> php has a very hard time supporting websocket
[00:36:19] <CaptainQuirk> ok
[00:36:30] <Cork> as it is very request oriented
[00:37:50] <CaptainQuirk> ok, thanks
[00:45:54] <CircleCode> Hi, do someone knows if .serialize handle correctly the form attribute?
[00:46:48] <Cork> CircleCode: serialize doesn't care about form attributes, if you by form attributes mean attributes on the form element
[00:47:15] <CircleCode> Cork:
[00:47:25] <Cork> all it cares about is the value, name and checked/disabled on the fields
[00:47:32] <CircleCode> Cork: I was referrint to the form attribute on the input element
[00:48:22] <CircleCode> say my document contains form_a and form_b, <input form="form_a"/> is a child of form_b
[00:48:44] <Cork> CircleCode: ah, you meant that way
[00:48:49] <CircleCode> on the html side, this input belongs to form_a even if it is nested into form_b
[00:48:51] <Cork> i don't think serialize uses that one
[00:49:39] <Cork> CircleCode: check if those are listed on form.elements
[00:49:55] <Cork> that is what serialize uses if you run it on a form element
[00:50:19] <CircleCode> Cork: thanks, i'll look at it (and do some tests, of course)
[01:26:41] <Adamantus> Good Morning
[01:28:12] <Adamantus> I'm trying to figure out how to do this effect on a transition. I can't figure out how to do the easing for ".toggleClass( className [, switch ] [, options ] )". HTML: http://www.seedetail.co.uk/seedetail_molecule/   JS: http://www.seedetail.co.uk/seedetail_molecule/js/general.js
[01:28:59] <Cork> adam_cameron: you need jquery ui for effects on toggleClass
[01:28:59] <Adamantus> I tried: $( this ).toggleClass('mm-hover',true,ease)  where ease = var ease={}; (relying on default properties) but no easing appears.
[01:29:26] <Cork> core only animates inline values
[01:29:30] <adam_cameron> that was probably directed at Adamantus , yes?
[01:29:43] <Cork> opps yes
[01:29:46] <Cork> sorry
[01:30:02] <Adamantus> Cork: ic, (don't wory about the mistake).
[01:31:59] <Adamantus> OK loading jquery ui had no effect.
[01:32:49] <Cork> Adamantus: https://jqueryui.com/toggleClass/
[01:35:31] <_Bradders> Hi all!
[01:36:57] <gavrochel> hello .
[01:37:30] <Adamantus> Cork: This is the constructor I can't get to work: .toggleClass( className [, switch ] [, options ] )   I need to be able to set the switch to true / false.
[01:37:44] <Adamantus> Although I could change the design.
[01:37:48] <gavrochel> how can I show the title of a element on click on that element?
[01:38:12] <Adamantus> gavrochel: getAttr maybe
[01:38:18] <gavrochel> like on hover but on click instead
[01:38:44] <Adamantus> Or attr() even
[01:39:15] <gavrochel> I can read it with attr but I want to display it on click
[01:39:25] <Cork> Adamantus: why should easing {} do anything?
[01:39:43] <Adamantus> Cork: I wanted to fall back on the default values.
[01:40:00] <Adamantus> I thought that by passing 3 params it would know I wanted easing.
[01:40:09] <Cork> Adamantus: no
[01:40:14] <Adamantus> So I passed an empty object.
[01:40:22] <Cork> if "swing" is the default
[01:42:42] <Adamantus> So at the moment it does no easing but changes instantly. So how do I add easing to my current code?
[01:46:18] <Cork> Adamantus: give easing a string instead of an object
[01:46:26] <gavrochel> how can I show the title of a element on click on that element? (like it shows on hover but I want it to show also on click)
[01:46:28] <_Bradders> Anyone know how I might push JSON data into a dynamically created form and update it with x-editable?
[01:46:53] <Cork> gavrochel: you basically can't
[01:47:04] <Cork> gavrochel: js can't trigger the tooltip it is browser native
[01:47:09] <_Bradders> The reason? The data I'm returning will vary based on the User and the multi-value nature of some of the properties
[01:47:20] <Cork> gavrochel: only option is to show something inpage instead
[01:47:54] <Cork> _Bradders: push data?
[01:48:10] <_Bradders> I love the look of http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/docs.html
[01:48:27] <_Bradders> Well, retrieve JSON formatted data and dynamically create the x-editable form
[01:48:36] <Cork> _Bradders: just create a hidden field and add it to the form i guess
[01:48:44] <Cork> depends on what the plugin does though
[01:51:16] <_Bradders> I'll keep hunting :)
[01:53:14] <gavrochel> ty cork
[01:53:22] <Cork> np
[01:57:29] <n-a-n> hi all
[02:01:56] <CircleCode> Cork: for your information, jQuery 1.10 seems to respect input's form attribute (see http://jsfiddle.net/CircleCode/H6KAH/)
[02:03:24] <Cork> CircleCode: and so do older versions
[02:03:34] <Cork> ok, so elements does the correct thing
[02:03:49] <Cork> and it works as long as the browser supports form=""
[02:03:52] <Cork> ok, good to know
[02:04:36] <Cork> CircleCode: fyi http://jsfiddle.net/H6KAH/1/
[02:05:50] <CircleCode> Cork: you answered the test I would have done next : what about IE8? (about to start browserstack, but you say it depends of browser support…)
[02:06:22] <Cork> CircleCode: ya
[02:28:47] <Macaveli> How do I loop these objects in jQuery? https://gist.github.com/YOUConsulting/c69894cf2314fbc15709
[02:34:15] <_Bradders> Hmm... XForms...
[02:42:04] <_Bradders> Done! http://www.alpacajs.org/demos/index.html
[02:52:55] <chrisTech2> My script only works once. It's inside document ready. I tried putting it outside but doesn't work at all. What am I doing wrong?
[02:53:09] <chrisTech2> I want it to work everytime.
[02:53:14] <chrisTech2> Not just once
[02:55:26] <_Bradders> jsfiddle?
[02:55:37] <_Bradders> chrisTech2: jsfiddle?
[03:04:07] <chrisTech2> _Bradders, http://jsfiddle.net/Hbw9x/
[03:13:48] <brunoais> chrisTech2, your code is confusing
[03:14:12] <brunoais> I'm pretty sure you wrote more than the double of the code you need and with much less redundancy
[03:14:25] <brunoais> *you wrote with loads of redundancy
[03:14:46] <brunoais> you can start by storing the reference to the elements in javascript arrays
[03:14:52] <brunoais> that will reduce the code a lot
[03:15:08] <StephenS> buenos noces
[03:15:17] <brunoais> I can't help you much because I don't know how it looks like in the end
[03:15:34] <brunoais> StephenS, buenas
[03:16:08] <StephenS> bsall
[03:17:04] <brunoais> StephenS, what's "bsall"?
[03:17:26] <StephenS> ball*
[03:18:41] <brunoais> chrisTech2, if you want my help call me. I'll be around
[03:18:45] <nod_> Hi all, I have a question related to initialization. Specifically, how necessary is jQuery.ready() when you're free from the "everything has to be in one script" rule. In which cases would something like this break horribly: IE9+ only https://gist.github.com/theodoreb/11396103
[03:19:56] <brunoais> nod_, the .ready() in jQuery is just a way to make sure you have all the DOM read and parsed before you do anything to it
[03:20:16] <fattest> how can i set the date to 2015 october ?  http://pastebin.com/zTaJD0n0
[03:20:23] <brunoais> it is also a thing some small scripts use when you defer (or async) jQuery
[03:20:27] <nod_> brunoais: yep, assuming I want the same thing without jQuery ready
[03:21:00] <brunoais> nod_, also, the code is asynchronous to the page so it does not stop its parsing with the execution of your code
[03:21:22] <brunoais> whith the added bonus that if it has a javascript exception, other scripts can still work
[03:21:45] <brunoais> if you make it all modular, only that "module" will fail
[03:21:50] <nod_> brunoais: I know this solution works, there is at least one website out there using it in production. Just want to know what might be wrong with it
[03:21:51] <brunoais> the rest will survive
[03:22:03] <StephenS> brunoais
[03:22:05] <brunoais> nod_, basically it's taking what I mentioned
[03:22:19] <nod_> brunoais: some more context maybe, it's for Drupal so there are a few things I can make sure
[03:22:22] <StephenS> how to make javascript work on dom when I pull content via ajax
[03:22:41] <brunoais> StephenS, eh... I'm not sure what you want
[03:22:52] <decx> delegate with on
[03:22:52] <brunoais> do you mean you are downloading javascript using ajax?
[03:23:01] <StephenS> decx I told you that 2 days ago
[03:23:05] <StephenS> but I had no success.
[03:23:13] <StephenS> brunoais kinda yes kinda no.
[03:23:23] <brunoais> StephenS, then explain, otherwise I dunno what you want
[03:23:28] <nod_> brunoais: on of the thing I was wondering about was if doing the init like this would have a risk or triggering before the dom is actually ready
[03:23:31] <StephenS> I expect that main src.js on index.php works for appended data from external script which is pulled via ajax.
[03:23:43] <decx> well i'm reading your nonsense all the time so i'm gonna assumme the problem is not in the suggestion but the execution
[03:23:48] <brunoais> fattest, read the manual about the Date object. search mdn. It's a good place to start
[03:24:41] <brunoais> nod_, unless you are going to change stuff after the <script> or the <body>, there's no issues
[03:24:56] <brunoais> there's no guarantee that the <body> tag is ready to be changed at that point
[03:25:07] <brunoais> because it hadn't been closed at that time
[03:25:39] <brunoais> StephenS, why using AJAX?
[03:25:46] <brunoais> why not just place the tag in the DOM?
[03:25:55] <brunoais> by creating it dynamically
[03:26:01] <nod_> brunoais: right, so that can be enforced. As long as the stuff inside is ready
[03:26:17] <StephenS> brunoais explain more
[03:26:23] <brunoais> nod_, Meh... I wouldn't call ready
[03:26:45] <brunoais> I have the principle of not changing the DOM until the DOMContentLoaded event
[03:27:08] <fattest> brunoais: i have a simple calender, i want to make it show october 2015 on page load, instead of april 2014. how can i do this? http://jsbin.com/juwiw/1/edit
[03:27:29] <StephenS> brunoais ..
[03:27:46] <brunoais> StephenS, 1st example here: http://www.qlambda.com/2012/01/add-script-tags-to-dom-dynamically.html
[03:28:09] <brunoais> fattest, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[03:28:43] <fattest> brunoais: i tried var date = new Date("October 13, 2015 11:13:00")
[03:28:44] <brunoais> fattest, I don't use that jQ extension so i have no clue how it works
[03:28:52] <fattest> ig
[03:28:54] <fattest> oh
[03:29:50] <brunoais> fattest, I don't even know how this works: new Date('2015', m, d-5)
[03:30:02] <brunoais> A constructor like that is not specified
[03:30:12] <brunoais> Oh wait
[03:30:15] <brunoais> nvm
[03:30:18] <brunoais> I misread there
[03:31:08] <fattest> yeah

[05:13:42] <Snoopal> how could i hand over it ?
[05:14:55] <Cork> Snoopal: it should exist
[05:15:01] <Cork> Snoopal: make a fiddle with the code

[05:19:13] <Snoopal> si is undefined in console
[05:19:21] <decx> isnt royal slider paid?
[05:19:27] <decx> make use of their support
[05:19:32] <Cork> Snoopal: your sure royalSlider returns anything?
[05:19:38] <Snoopal> ha
[05:19:42] <Snoopal> for some reason it works now?
[05:19:46] <Snoopal> what the hell? :D

[05:21:25] <slax0r> $this.siblings().find(".someclass").first() will get the first sibling of the current element with that class?
[05:21:52] <Cork> no

[05:22:06] <decx> .nextAll('.class').eq(0)
[05:22:16] <Cork> oh
[05:22:29] <slax0r> tnx
[05:24:34] <alaing> hi, I'm having a problem with jquery ui autocomplete. it was working when I was using jquery 1.8.17 but now I've using 1.10.3
[05:25:49] <alaing> i'm using I'm using source option to do ajax call
[05:26:20] <alaing> which its doing but its not showing the list
[05:28:18] <delboy1978uk1> anyone here use FlexSlider? I cant get the darned thing to slow down
[05:30:01] <bberry> if im setting the ID of an element, i want to use attr, right?
[05:30:13] <hlfw0rd> I have a function that is launched when a set of checkboxes are checked or unchecked. It will toggle news posts that are part of a category (displaying or hiding).  Now I have arrow buttons (simple pagination) that load new posts in via ajax. How can I attach that filter object to that to hide or show newly loaded posts? http://pastebin.com/EGu13pXt
[05:30:20] <hlfw0rd> I am not sure what the best approach would be
[05:34:38] <Cork> hlfw0rd: simplest is prob to hide and show the elements based on a class you put on a common parent
[05:34:39] <Cork> hlfw0rd: then those elements will be hidden without you having to do anything
[05:34:44] <hlfw0rd> Cork, I see, I'll try that instead of toggle then
[05:46:47] <alaing> My problem is fixed....
[05:46:54] <alaing> for thos interested http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17753674/jquery-ui-autocomplete-doesnt-display-in-jquery-ui-dialog
[05:47:43] <bberry>  if im setting the ID of an element, i want to use attr, right?
[05:48:27] <brunoais> bberry, no. It's prop()
[05:48:47] <brunoais> attr is stiff oyu get and set with getAttribute() and setAttribute().
[05:49:05] <brunoais> the prop is when you get and set directly by using the DOM object's property
[06:01:15] <bberry> kk
[06:02:15] <slax0r> anyone using fancybox2? how do I force a resize when new data is being added to it?
[06:08:24] <Pupeno> Is there a way to do this in one selector without having any repetition in it: $(".filter_bar_old, .filter_bar").find("select#manager") ?
[06:08:57] <Cork> Pupeno: you could convert _old to .old
[06:09:22] <Pupeno> I need the css for the new filter_bar to not affect .filter_bar_old at all.
[06:09:29] <Cork> meaning <elm class="filter_bar_old"> becomes <elm class="filter_bar old">
[06:09:49] <Cork> Pupeno: then add a .new to the other one :)
[06:09:57] <Cork> or use :not(.old)
[06:12:31] <bberry> is this a really stupid idea? http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/ im going to be using it in a constructor function that will need to add elements to a div, but i dont know what the elements are going to be.
[06:13:52] <Cork> bberry: $(document.createElement(e.type)) => $('<' + e.type + '>')
[06:14:25] <Cork> bberry: is it ok to change the structure of the el object a bit?
[06:14:27] <bberry> really? i was reading an SO post saying otherwise :/
[06:14:33] <bberry> Cork: please do!
[06:15:03] <bberry> Cork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327047/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-create-html-elements-using-jquery
[06:16:12] <Cork> bberry: you're never going to need more then one child?
[06:16:28] <bberry> ah. didnt think about that. i meant to have it be an array
[06:20:17] <Cork> bberry: not complete, but i would do something like http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/1/
[06:20:44] <Cork> opps missed a parenthesis
[06:20:52] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/2/
[06:21:44] <siepet> hey, i have this: http://jsfiddle.net/x236h/1/ and i would like to modify it so after expanding nested-rows, i want to be able to hide all children and subchildren and not sure how to do this
[06:23:14] <brunoais> siepet, if you hide the parent, all children will be hidden too
[06:24:16] <brunoais> siepet, these are not really parent-child relationships :S
[06:24:16] <siepet> brunoais: hm, when i expand parent, it's parent-> child1, child2; when i expand child1 and close hide parent it's like: parent->subchildren of child1
[06:24:32] <brunoais> you have children with the parent
[06:25:37] <brunoais> siepet, Hum... I think the principle of what you are doing I wrong...
[06:25:44] <brunoais> *is wrong
[06:25:48] <brunoais> let me get here something
[06:26:37] <siepet> it would be easier if i worked with lists, as i've seen on the internet but i really want to make it with table
[06:27:10] <brunoais> siepet, I think, in this case, it's the parent that needs to know his children and not the other way around
[06:27:32] <brunoais> he needs to know what to expand and what not expand
[06:27:40] <brunoais> the children are just slaves
[06:27:47] <bberry> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/5/
[06:27:55] <bberry> Cork: better?
[06:28:03] <brunoais> siepet, try changing the mindset of it
[06:28:11] <Cork> bberry: just got it done http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/6/
[06:28:13] <brunoais> give the parent the info about what are his children
[06:28:28] <brunoais> see if that helps you making it better
[06:28:30] <siepet> how can i set then multiple childs of one parent? can i do something like data-childid="id1 id2 id3 id4"?
[06:28:31] <Cork> bberry: i really recommend not to use if without {}
[06:28:40] <Cork> bberry: it is a well known source for bugs
[06:28:43] <brunoais> siepet, yeah, that's a way
[06:28:51] <bberry> Cork: okie doke.
[06:29:05] <brunoais> siepet, then you split it by spaces and you get all that matter
[06:29:05] <siepet> brunoais: okay, will try to change, thank you very much :)
[06:29:28] <brunoais> siepet, call me when done. I'm also curious if my idea works
[06:29:31] <brunoais> pls
[06:29:42] <Cork> bberry: but except for that sure, your structure works too
[06:30:10] <siepet> brunoais: okay, no problem :)
[06:30:21] <Cork> bberry: mine allows the array to be optional, but you might not need that :()
[06:30:24] <Cork> *:)
[06:31:07] <bberry> Cork: Oh i just noticed your post for /6/. ill check it out haha
[06:31:33] <decx> siepet why not have semantically correct nesting of elements instead of a table hodge-podge?
[06:32:05] <decx> hotchpotch?
[06:32:05] <siepet> decx: sorry, i have no idea what that means
[06:32:26] <decx> your elements are all on one layer
[06:33:02] <bberry> Cork: sweet looks good. haha it's kind of a cool little tool actually :P though i dont know if it has any use in the public spectrum
[06:34:13] <Cork> bberry: type could be removed if there was a reliable way to get the key that wasn't children
[06:34:23] <Cork> bberry: then it could be compressed quite a bit more
[06:34:38] <Cork> but ya, this is prob as good as it gets
[06:34:44] <bberry> Cork: yeah, definitely. thanks again :P
[06:34:47] <Cork> np
[06:35:02] <siepet> decx: yes, because it's table and this is how i was told it should be
[06:36:20] <decx> i don't know what the conventions are for nesting content in a table but this just seems wrong to me
[06:46:42] <BillCriswell> decx: We did that back in the 02.
[06:47:06] <BillCriswell> How much you wanna make a bet I can build this website with <table>s?
[06:48:17] <decx> if it'S tabular data a table is still appropirate, but i don't know about nesting another table
[06:48:21] <decx> and yes, i mean pirate
[06:48:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Oh I know.
[06:49:08] <BillCriswell> I wonder when nesting tables is appropriate.
[06:49:27] <BillCriswell> I imagine since it's legal HTML there must be at least one case for it?
[06:49:35] <decx> heard yo like tables so i put a table in yo table?
[06:50:01] <siepet> it wasn't really nested table, it was a table with a lot of rows that toggle when needed
[06:51:27] <JustMozzy> hey guys. anyone here knows about hammerjs? I have a weird behaviour that dragleft and dragright are triggered after I release my finger from the display
[06:51:31] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Get that IE9 issue figured out?
[06:51:52] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: It sounds like your drag tolerance may be really low.
[06:52:15] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: I've set my dragMinDistance to 1
[06:52:25] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: That would do it.
[06:53:18] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: it doesn't :s
[06:53:39] <BillCriswell> Did you try setting it to something higher?
[06:53:40] <decx> no worries, i got this http://i.imgur.com/QVFFsqS.png
[06:54:24] <BillCriswell> The internet has pictures for everything.
[06:54:52] <BillCriswell> Like... 10-15? I think that would be ok... hard to say thought. Fingers ain't no mouse.
[06:54:59] <BillCriswell> Default is 25.
[06:55:57] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: no change in the behaviour
[06:57:12] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Hmmm... so what are you setting dragMinDistance to?
[06:57:49] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: right now I tried 25, 15, 10, and 1
[06:58:17] <puchacz> hi, if I POST a form, and there are validation errors, I want to redirect back to the form, but redirect is GET. There are limitations on URL size so it does not sound like a good idea to GET the whole form content. how am I to solve it please?
[06:58:19] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: I would need a demo there, but if you set it to 25 I see no reason that would be happening.
[06:59:07] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: It only happens on my Nexus Android 4.4.2 and 4.2 iphone and ipad are alright
[06:59:26] <BillCriswell> puchacz: You can repopulate the form from the post data. There are limitations on the URL but it's pretty big.
[06:59:41] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Oh, no idea there. Sure it's not cached?
[07:00:09] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: can't be too sure. just tried on firefox on the same device and it triggers correctly
[07:00:09] <BillCriswell> "catched" or "ca-shayed"?
[07:00:17] <BillCriswell> or "cashed"
[07:00:22] <puchacz> BillCriswell: I always do redirect after post because I don't want browser messages on F5 (page refresh), you know what I mean?
[07:00:29] <decx> kay-tsch ?
[07:01:17] <BillCriswell> JustMozzy: Sounds like it might just be an issue with the browser then. Not sure. =(
[07:01:26] <JustMozzy> BillCriswell: seems like it :/
[07:01:27] <BillCriswell> decx: I can't even pronounce that.
[07:01:41] <decx> let's pronounce scsi
[07:01:50] <decx> skasi?
[07:02:02] <puchacz> BillCriswell: 2000 chars is not much if you have article content..... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers
[07:02:13] <puchacz> decx: yes, skazi
[07:02:19] <BillCriswell> I make "scsi" into two syllables. Is that, right?
[07:03:04] <decx> esé si, yes bro?
[07:03:17] <BillCriswell> puchacz: If you redirect to the form the resubmit message wouldn't show up?
[07:03:44] <puchacz> BillCriswell: no, why would it?
[07:04:03] <BillCriswell> I thought that was your argument for not repopulating from the post data?
[07:04:14] <brunoais> siepet, were you able to do it?
[07:05:53] <siepet> brunoais: still doing it
[07:05:58] <brunoais> ok
[07:06:54] <xvoom> hi all
[07:07:36] <brunoais> hey
[07:07:45] <xvoom> im new to jquery and im trying to make a content slider and i dont know where to start
[07:08:28] <xvoom> so any advice ara welcome
[07:09:46] <puchacz> BillCriswell: I want to show form prepopulated with whatever user typed in, with validation error messages. My execution path is: submit form with POST, validate, on error redirect to the form, populated.
[07:09:49] <puchacz> redirect is GET
[07:09:56] <puchacz> I don't want to generate form on HTML
[07:10:00] <puchacz> on POST I mean
[07:10:41] <decx> xvoom it's complex topic so if you don't want to use it as a learning experience use an existing solution like flexslider, bxslider, bootstraps built in carousel
[07:11:01] <decx> or any of the other 5million free scripts
[07:11:12] <BillCriswell> puchacz: If you just realized you can't use get what do you plan on doing?
[07:11:26] <puchacz> BillCriswell: I don't know yet
[07:11:37] <puchacz> keep state on server side is one solution, but messy
[07:12:11] <JustMozzy> so, still in hammerjs. if I want to prevent scrolling while I am dragging, I should call e.preventDefault() right?
[07:13:23] <siepet> also, one quick question: when i toggle a whole row
[07:13:24] <bberry> Cork: updated http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/9/ I removed the p thing, since it wasnt being used, and i made it only return javascript elements instead of a mixture of js and jquery elements. The only other addition that might be nice is to allow it to accept already created elements as well, not sure how id do that though. Something like this... http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/11/
[07:13:41] <siepet> also, one quick question: when i toggle a whole row, it might resize the column widths, how can i make it non-resizable?
[07:13:48] <BillCriswell> puchacz: You mean client side?
[07:14:25] <puchacz> BillCriswell: no, server side. HTML is being rebuilt completely on redirect, so where would it be on client?
[07:14:37] <puchacz> I can do AJAX post as well
[07:14:44] <puchacz> hmmm, may be preferable
[07:15:15] <BillCriswell> puchacz: You could use localStorage and save the form data as a JSON object then repopulate from there.
[07:16:25] <puchacz> BillCriswell: sounds complex. BTW, jquery .serialize() on form seems to be creating URL query string, not POST form, is this correct?
[07:17:01] <BillCriswell> What do you imagine a post form would look like?
[07:17:18] <puchacz> an object with .post() method
[07:18:26] <Cork> bberry: http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/12/
[07:18:29] <BillCriswell> Well not wanting to repopulate from the post data is making it complex.
[07:18:49] <puchacz> do you like the message on F5?
[07:19:00] <puchacz> when HTML came from POST?
[07:19:29] <Cork> bberry: opps extra unused code removed http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/13/
[07:19:30] <BillCriswell> Why would they be pressing f5?
[07:20:15] <BillCriswell> If you want the data in an array of json objects you can use .serializeArray() instead.
[07:21:57] <puchacz> BillCriswell: thanks
[07:22:15] <bberry> Cork: very nice! thanks :P
[07:25:28] <xvoom> decx thanks a lot
[07:26:21] <knownasilya> hello, has anyone worked with contenteditable? HAving issues when erasing all text, can't edit after that..
[07:27:44] <erming_> knownasilya: show your code, pastebin or something
[07:28:40] <knownasilya> $dd.find('.btn.name').attr('contenteditable', true).focus();
[07:30:13] <knownasilya> erming_: http://jsbin.com/ximaq/1/
[07:30:18] <knownasilya> edit the button
[07:30:32] <knownasilya> erase all text and try to put more text in
[07:31:01] <decx> works for me
[07:32:58] <BillCriswell> decx: Ever have to use content editable?
[07:33:41] <decx> no
[07:34:12] <BillCriswell> Me either. Trying to think of when it would be useful?
[07:34:13] <knownasilya> decx: what works for you?
[07:34:21] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to serialize that data?
[07:34:51] <decx> i can add text after i deleted all text knownasilya
[07:35:01] <decx> never thought about it BillCriswell
[07:35:12] <brunoais> BillCriswell, I have
[07:35:53] <knownasilya> decx: what browser?
[07:36:21] <decx> ff
[07:37:00] <knownasilya> decx: yup, so looks like it's a chrome issue
[07:37:17] <knownasilya> anyone know of a good contenteditable polyfil?
[07:37:33] <BillCriswell> brunoais: When did you use it and what for? Trying to think of a usecase.
[07:38:05] <brunoais> BillCriswell, WYSWIYG editor
[07:38:23] <brunoais> knownasilya, a polyfill for which browser?
[07:38:48] <knownasilya> all? since they all have issues (doesn't even work in safari)
[07:39:37] <brunoais> knownasilya, It works well on all browsers for me
[07:39:44] <brunoais> they don't produce the same HTML
[07:39:53] <brunoais> but the results of what they produce is nearly the same
[07:39:57] <mightyiam> Hi! in Firefox, `.filter('li > *')` returns does what I would expect. In Chromium, it returns an empty array (not even a jQuery object). Am I using it wrong? jQuery 1.4.4
[07:40:22] <brunoais> mightyiam, update jQuery for starters :S
[07:40:24] <knownasilya> brunoais: i'm not looking for a wysiwyg
[07:40:25] <brunoais> that's quite old
[07:40:35] <BillCriswell> I still don't get it.
[07:40:44] <brunoais> knownasilya, I've made other stuff but it was mostely for testing
[07:41:16] <brunoais> BillCriswell, the best use-case is the WYSIWYG editor
[07:41:27] <brunoais> it does not have many different alternatives to that
[07:41:44] <decx> updating a timetable on a page directly
[07:42:06] <mightyiam> brunoais, I will but not immediately. Could you think of an alternative to this?
[07:42:29] <BillCriswell> brunoais: Got ya.
[07:43:06] <brunoais> mightyiam, Eh... not really. I dunno how that version of jQuery works
[07:43:20] <brunoais> the version I read was around 1.5; 1.6ish
[07:43:27] <brunoais> and now I read parts of the 1.11 one
[07:44:47] <mightyiam> brunoais, well, in what you read, could you think of an alternative?
[07:45:00] <brunoais> Hum...
[07:45:05] <brunoais> nope, not really
[07:45:09] <brunoais> It actaully makes no sense
[07:45:21] <brunoais> it should always return a jQuery instance
[07:46:13] <mightyiam> brunoais, I know :)
[07:49:26] <mightyiam> brunoais, perhaps I'll use .map()
[07:49:42] <brunoais> mightyiam, can't help you there, sorry :S
[07:50:05] <mightyiam> brunoais, no worries
[08:03:04] <pthreat> BillCriswell: So about yesterday's problem, I had to do a little hack, just position out of the canvas the input file with position:absolute and top:-500px, in that fashion I was able to trigger the click event on the android browser with the styled button
[08:03:23] <pthreat> I'm now facing another problem which I think it must be due to a secruity restriction...
[08:03:27] <pthreat> security even
[08:04:18] <puchacz> some pages have "do you really want to leave this page, you are editing something" popups. how are they done pleaase?
[08:04:28] <pthreat> $(document).on('change','#file',function(){ var file = document.getElementById("file"); console.log(file.value);
[08:04:29] <pthreat> I/browser ( 2531): Console:  http://
[08:04:40] <pthreat> Console: EMPTY http://
[08:04:47] <smudgySmidgen> Hi. Trying to create two DOM objects on the fly. A div and a select inside that div.
[08:05:02] <smudgySmidgen> Tried doing the following but apparently you can't create the select that way. 'containerControl = document.createElement("div");         ddlControl = $(containerControl).add("select");'
[08:05:12] <NoiseEee> puchacz: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.onbeforeunload
[08:05:13] <pthreat> smudgySmidgen: append
[08:05:27] <puchacz> NoiseEee: thanks
[08:06:07] <puchacz> NoiseEee: no jquery wrapper?
[08:06:33] <NoiseEee> puchacz: no point / window is window
[08:07:22] <puchacz> NoiseEee: ok, thanks
[08:10:02] <puchacz> going back to my previous question, sending ajax post.
[08:10:22] <puchacz> I did it as shown in jquery doc:
[08:10:32] <puchacz> $.post('/bubo5/save-webpage-flashcard-dao', $('#ZPxnVQGGURcCQYQZLZXwngbIhQoRYLam').serialize(), function () { .... } )
[08:10:34] <puchacz> but
[08:10:47] <puchacz> serialize() will produce URL that is potentially too long
[08:11:19] <puchacz> BillCriswell mentioned I should use serializeArray() instead, but I cannot find any example
[08:12:11] <NoiseEee> no puchacz, $.post( "test.php", $( "#testform" ).serialize() ); will POST it, not send via get, no url restriction
[08:12:43] <BillCriswell> I mentioned you could use that, the way it's passed in that second parameter doesn't matter.
[08:12:44] <puchacz> NoiseEee: will it parse my url query string (the one produced by .serialize() ) ?
[08:13:12] <puchacz> BillCriswell: so you second what NoiseEee is saying that my code is ok?
[08:13:28] <NoiseEee> puchacz: you're sending the serialized form as data, not in the URL
[08:14:16] <puchacz> NoiseEee: ok - I understand it has to be re-analysed by .post() before sending then
[08:15:03] <puchacz> de-serialised and serialised again as POST
[08:24:11] <smudgySmidgen> pthreat: append doesn't really work in that context either.  'containerControl = document.createElement("div"); ddlControl = $(containerControl).append("select");'
[08:24:28] <smudgySmidgen> ddlControl would be assigned  [ <div>​select​</div>​ ] in that case
[08:24:41] <smudgySmidgen> (the same result as with 'add' instead of 'append'
[08:26:09] <smudgySmidgen> I would really like to be able to find some kind of add/append function that lets me create elements inside other elemtents but works in a way that's similar to createElement. that is - takes a tag name as an argument
[08:27:02] <smudgySmidgen> here's an example fiddle where I'm trying to add a select filled with options.. but it only adds 'select' as a text string http://jsfiddle.net/nchqG/6/
[08:27:43] <erming_> so, you can't use: $("#container").append($("<div>")); ?
[08:28:57] <hoylemd> I'm having a problem with the datepicker component of jquery-ui.  I'm passing {dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd"} to the $().datepicker() method, but whnever I choose a date, it goes back to the american format (mm/yy/yy).
[08:29:43] <smudgySmidgen> erming_ : I would prefer to avoid adding stuff to the DOM directly. would rather just store everything as variables and then add it to the DOM later
[08:30:08] <erming_> if you create something like this: var x = $("<div>");
[08:30:20] <erming_> x isn't added to the DOM, until you append it to something
[08:30:29] <smudgySmidgen> erming_ : i wanna build a div with a select containing some options and return all of it as a string. the callee can then decide where to add it to the page
[08:31:04] <erming_> so, you want HTML string instead of jQuery object?
[08:31:27] <Uhkis> hoylemd: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-dateFormat
[08:31:30] <erming_> "<select><option></option></select>" vs $("<select>").append($("<option>"));
[08:31:40] <pthreat> LOL
[08:32:39] <smudgySmidgen> erming_ : nah actually, ignore the string part. I DO want a jquery object.
[08:33:41] <smudgySmidgen> I want to avoid having to write entire html tags in strings. would prefer if I can write tag names only, as you can with for instance: document.createElement("div")
[08:33:55] <hoylemd> Uhkis: yes, I am doing exactly what the API told me to do, and it's not working
[08:34:17] <NoiseEee> smudgySmidgen: var div = $('<div>',{id:'donkeyDiv'})
[08:34:53] <smudgySmidgen> NoiseEee: and if I want to add another element to that div?
[08:35:13] <erming_> or $("<div>").attr("id", "donkeyDiv").addClass("randomClass").append(otherDiv);
[08:35:19] <NoiseEee> smudgySmidgen: var appendedStuff = $('<div>',{id:'donkeyDiv'}).append($('<p>').text('hi mom'))
[08:35:26] <pthreat> erming_: oh no .. don't use append
[08:35:27] <pthreat> lol
[08:35:38] <erming_> pthreat why?
[08:35:43] <pthreat> erming_: joke
[08:36:00] <erming_> i don't get it :( heh
[08:36:47] <erming_> (scrolling through the chat logs) i see you've already told him to use append :)
[08:39:37] <Uhkis> hoylemd: can you make a jsfiddle?
[08:40:30] <pthreat> I'm doing a webapp for android. I'm facing an issue trying to obtain the value of an <input type="file" > throughout JQuery using $("input#file").val(); Even doing console.log($("input#file").val()) shows empty in adb with logcat. Is there any restriction I should be aware of ?
[08:41:28] <BinaryKitten> mostly that browsers don't allow file uploads to get value via JS
[08:41:42] <erming_> pthreat: what if you force submit of the form and fetch the file value that way
[08:41:51] <BinaryKitten> pthreat what wrapper are you using?
[08:42:03] <BinaryKitten> phonegap, titanium (or w/e)
[08:42:06] <smudgySmidgen> NoiseEee: thanks, that works ok. But is there no way to do something like that without having to specify the angle brackets? it's just a little hang up i have..
[08:42:09] <hoylemd> Uhkis: I tried, but it's not happening there. I'm investigating a theory that it's caused by setting the calue of the inpout before making it a datepicker and passing the format.
[08:42:29] <pthreat> BinaryKitten: I'm just using the stock android web browser as of now
[08:42:38] <BinaryKitten> urm
[08:42:42] <erming_> smudgySmidgen: no, you need angle brackets.. Otherwise it will interpret it as a selector
[08:42:51] <BinaryKitten> so you're making a standard web page then pthreat not an app
[08:42:53] <erming_> $("<div>") vs $("div")
[08:43:09] <pthreat> BinaryKitten: exactly ... which I will convert it into an app later using WebView
[08:43:12] <BinaryKitten> so yeah, it's not going to work well for file uploads
[08:43:31] <BinaryKitten> because you've not got the embedded permissions set.
[08:43:50] <NoiseEee> smudgySmidgen: usual DOM rules apply, by the way... if you're appending/creating a lot of elements, it will be faster to make a document fragment and append that (will also avoid repaints)
[08:44:39] <pthreat> BinaryKitten: so you're suggesting I make the app first
[08:45:14] <pthreat> I do want this to also work on a stock web browser ...
[08:45:52] <BinaryKitten> pthreat what i'm saying is that there is a security layer that prevents JS from interacting with the file input directly
[08:46:14] <BinaryKitten> if you're using something like phonegap etc, they provide an api that gets around this.
[08:46:40] <BinaryKitten> for stock android dev, you'll need to use a similar work around
[08:47:07] <BinaryKitten> straight html/js though will not allow it (without fudges)
[08:48:17] <drej> simple way to fix it is to use some :before/ after elements attached to the <label> element
[08:48:23] <drej> to overlap the file input with whatever you want
[08:48:31] <drej> and on click, it'll still focus the file input so it'll trigger default browser behaviour
[08:48:38] <hoylemd> Uhkis: it seems that passing {dateFormat: "yy-mm-dd"} to $(selector).datepicker() isn't actually setting the format
[08:48:49] <BinaryKitten> drej not going to be able to get the "value" of it though
[08:48:54] <drej> kind of how i did this checkbox replacement: http://jsfiddle.net/pudly/UQj3q/7/
[08:48:58] <pthreat> Yeah I need the value
[08:48:59] <drej> no you wont be able to get a value of it
[08:49:09] <drej> pthreat then your'e SOL, the value is abstracted from the browser
[08:49:11] <drej> for security reasons
[08:49:19] <drej> especially on mobile devices that have locked out file systems
[08:49:38] <pthreat> Well wasting space ... is not an option so uploading the file and checking serverside is not an option
[08:49:53] <erming_> by value: you mean the file, or the filepath?
[08:50:03] <pthreat> just the name erming_
[08:50:06] <pthreat> I don't need the path
[08:50:13] <pthreat> BinaryKitten: so you recommend phonegap
[08:50:25] <BinaryKitten> pthreat i don't recommend anything.
[08:50:38] <hoylemd> looks like it might be that my jquery-ui file is out of date
[08:50:38] <BinaryKitten> just that i know that phonegap has that api available
[08:50:48] <BinaryKitten> and i'm not an android developer
[08:51:03] <erming_> ehm, not sure what you want, but try this pthreat: http://jsfiddle.net/X8VS3/1/ it works for me in chrome, FF and IE
[08:53:38] <smudgySmidgen> NoiseEee: hmm noticed that in the following piece of code, appendedStuff isn't just assigned the paragraph. it's assigned the entire div and all the content. ' var appendedStuff = $('<div>',{id:'donkeyDiv'}).append($('<p>').text('hi mom')) '
[08:54:16] <pthreat> erming_: that works in any browser, it will however not work in an android browser
[08:54:21] <erming_> aha
[08:54:37] <smudgySmidgen> I need to create new elements, append them to previously created elements AND return the value of the new element only to a variable
[08:54:44] <pthreat> because of fucking "security" related issues (wow ...)
[08:55:03] <BillCriswell> Little does Chrome know I have a c:\fakepath
[08:55:17] <pthreat> haha
[08:55:19] <NoiseEee> smudgySmidgen: then you'll have to do it element by element
[08:55:23] <erming_> porn folder, eh?
[08:55:32] <pthreat> C.\fuckpath\
[08:55:39] <pthreat> thats his porn folder
[08:55:53] <pthreat> fakepath is just were he stores pictures of his second family
[08:56:00] <pthreat> s/were/where/
[08:56:27] <pthreat> c:\fakepath\my_other_two_kids\
[08:56:32] <BillCriswell> Mostly just things liek this: http://imgur.com/G84KB1X
[08:57:00] <pthreat> and pictures of sharks with laserbeams attached to their heads, right
[08:57:22] <drej> pthreat phonegap is a framework that lets you bundle a webapp as a native app
[08:57:26] <drej> its not somthing you can add to your existing website
[08:57:30] <drej> if youre expecting people to visit it with a browser
[08:57:45] <pthreat> No ... I know
[08:57:52] <drej> k just checking
[08:58:02] <pthreat> I'm considering what should I do
[08:58:27] <erming_> pthreat: java applet!
[08:58:33] <erming_> ;)
[08:58:35] <pthreat> hell no

[09:03:56] <lericson_> ~<
[09:04:16] <Velveeta> i saw one of the greatest wall of death videos ever, a couple years ago, and i've never been able to find it again
[09:04:35] <pthreat> Velveeta: dude that wall was INSANE
[09:04:47] <Velveeta> yeah it wasn't too bad
[09:04:53] <Velveeta> way more than i could handle
[09:05:02] <Velveeta> i don't even like being jostled in a crowd

[09:10:39] <aboudreault> if I want that my $.getScript promise return only *after* the execution of the script... I have to use $.ajax with async: false ?
[09:16:53] <nhulea> yo!
[09:17:04] <nhulea> welcome to tuesday!
[09:17:15] <duch_kazatel> word
[09:17:24] <thebope> Should I drop grad school?
[09:17:42] <nhulea> should i join grad school
[09:17:43] <thebope> That's my jquery question for the day
[09:17:49] <thebope> Are you full time employed?
[09:17:55] <thebope> Do you have to take loans?
[09:17:59] <nhulea> yes
[09:18:00] <NoiseEee> you spelled 'grade' wrong, thebope
[09:18:01] <nhulea> yes
[09:18:06] <duch_kazatel> BAM
[09:18:08] <duch_kazatel> NoiseEee++
[09:18:09] <thebope> Is it 100 blocks from your house after a 9 hour work day?
[09:18:31] <thebope> I'm serious you gois
[09:18:41] <nhulea> I am actually not sure how many block it is
[09:18:52] <nhulea> *blocks
[09:18:54] <thebope> It's either study for my final today or go to watch a live taping of the daily show
[09:19:06] <nhulea> oh shit daily show for sure
[09:19:13] <thebope> Yea I know right?
[09:19:19] <thebope> I think Jon Stewart is going to retire
[09:19:21] <thebope> at some point
[09:19:24] <thebope> in the next decade
[09:19:27] <NoiseEee> grad school has a 'final' ?
[09:19:33] <thebope> Yea, a final exam
[09:19:37] <thebope> Well this class does
[09:19:38] <nhulea> dude i went to conan when he was on the tonight show it was fucking awesome
[09:19:46] <thebope> That is awesome
[09:19:54] <nhulea> can we help you cheat on the exam
[09:19:55] <thebope> You in NYC too?
[09:20:03] <thebope> Eh, I wouldn't cheat if I could
[09:20:07] * nhulea looks for mobile irc client
[09:20:14] <thebope> lol
[09:20:23] <thebope> Computer Vision
[09:20:27] <thebope> super interesting
[09:20:47] <nhulea> I am in Los angeles
[09:21:08] <thebope> ahh that makes sense
[09:21:55] <nhulea> how do the tickets work with the daily show ?
[09:22:52] <decx> with colbert gone, viacom will pay stewart millions to keep it up for a few decades. so i'd say study for your future
[09:23:09] <decx> by going to the daily show...
[09:23:57] <nhulea> yeah that seems about right I really thought john oliver was going to replace colbert but he went to hbo
[09:24:40] <_biff> hi. if i use jquery which posts a textarea content, and this is saved to the server, there is no upcoming download window(i want to download the textarea content). but if i use simple post download window comes up correctly...what should i do
[09:25:15] <thebope> my futures set
[09:25:28] <thebope> I already make greater than the median income of an average american and I'm 24
[09:25:33] <thebope> Being a developers wonderful
[09:25:44] <thebope> ahhh decx you sly dog
[09:26:09] <decx> it's all in the timing
[09:30:04] <_biff> so why dont come up the download dialog if i use jquery
[09:30:11] <duch_kazatel> _biff your question is really confusing.  could you paste your code on jsfiddle?
[09:33:39] <slikts> how big is jquery 2 compressed?
[09:33:43] <_biff> duch_kazatel im just asking what could be the difference between calling the php download function after post the form  - and calling jquery post which calls the download function. of course both method save correctly the textareacontent to the server before calling download
[09:34:07] <slikts> and why was this info removed from jquery's site?
[09:34:34] <decx> 30k
[09:34:45] <BillCriswell> I want 30K.
[09:34:51] <drej> i want $30k
[09:35:19] <BillCriswell> I'd like to attempt to rob a bank, just for fun.
[09:35:23] <BillCriswell> Unless I get away with it.
[09:35:29] <BillCriswell> Then you know I'll keep the money.
[09:38:29] <nhulea> BillCriswell: I m down lets do it
[09:39:07] <BillCriswell> Important question: What will the getaway music be?
[09:39:07] <aboudreault> is this line of $.getScript doc "The callback is fired once the script has been loaded but not necessarily executed." always relevant?
[09:39:32] <BillCriswell> I'm thinking something 80's. I have literally no idea why.
[09:40:01] <nhulea> hmm maybe http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pikc9vYv1LE
[09:41:02] <BillCriswell> nhulea: This works.
[09:41:08] <nhulea> for some reason beverly hills cop came to mind not sure but it could work I think
[09:41:45] <nhulea> alright well we just need a getaway car and a bank and we should be good to go
[09:41:47] <BillCriswell> Flock Of Seagulls - "I ran" came to mind, but it's too obvious.
[09:42:20] <duch_kazatel> "Run to the Hills"
[09:42:25] <nhulea> I think well be driving a while so maybe we should make the getaway playlist
[09:42:39] <BillCriswell> Good point.
[09:42:48] <nhulea> hah
[09:43:09] <BillCriswell> Streetlight Manifesto - "Everything Goes Numb" since it's literally about robbing a bank.
[09:44:51] <nhulea> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/n6ELK/1/ there we can keep adding haha
[09:45:35] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: what is the run the hills?
[09:45:46] <nhulea> run to the hills\
[09:46:05] <nhulea> I dont know streetlight manifesto either I gotta check that out
[09:46:08] <thebope> To the daily show!!
[09:46:31] <nhulea> thebope: say high to jon stewart for me
[09:46:55] <BillCriswell> It's like.. hardest / faster ska than usual.
[09:47:13] <nhulea> oh word ok I like that shit
[09:49:29] <BillCriswell> s/hardest/harder*
[09:53:45] <nhulea> pretty good I like it
[09:59:39] <BillCriswell> He writes some really intelligent music lyrically.
[10:05:49] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.
[10:05:49] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> https://gist.github.com/Csharper1972/11390229
[10:05:49] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[10:05:49] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling.
[10:05:49] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Where is the problem with the code ?
[10:08:28] <nhulea> Sharperte: looks like its working to me ?
[10:09:13] <nhulea> is this news update ticker supposed to be on test or home ?
[10:09:38] <NoiseEee> hint: when the code sample has dates from 2007, there might be a better library out there ;P
[10:13:03] <nhulea> protip: listen to NoiseEee
[10:40:15] <Voyage> can jquery/javascript print out the url entered in address bar of a browser?
[10:40:23] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:40:27] <Voyage> how
[10:40:31] <duch_kazatel> window.location.href is the current address.
[10:41:00] <Voyage> var url = $(window.location.href); you mean?
[10:41:14] <duch_kazatel> just window.location.href.
[10:41:15] <duch_kazatel> that's the object. no need to wrap in jquery.
[10:41:25] <Voyage> thats JS pure/
[10:41:28] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[10:43:10] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  looks good for a current page link (alternate to the refresh button of browser) <a href="<script>window.location.href</script>"></a>
[10:43:22] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[10:43:25] <duch_kazatel> don't do that.
[10:43:31] <Voyage> am. why?
[10:43:40] <Voyage> thats not valid?
[10:43:57] <duch_kazatel> lol not really.  putting javascript in html like that is a bad idea anyway.
[10:44:20] <Voyage> how to fix it
[10:44:34] <duch_kazatel> do you have a javascript file you can put your code in?
[10:44:49] <Voyage> yes
[10:45:07] <duch_kazatel> can you add an id to that link?
[10:45:17] <Voyage> yup
[10:45:23] <Voyage> id?
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> <a id="refreshPage">
[10:45:45] <Voyage> oh ya
[10:46:10] <duch_kazatel> and you just want to reload the page?
[10:46:27] <Voyage> so $("#refresh").html( window.location.href)
[10:46:32] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:46:42] <Voyage> yes. just a hyperlink to current page
[10:46:50] <Voyage> to reload
[10:46:53] <duch_kazatel> $('#refreshPage').click(function(){ window.location.reload(true) });
[10:47:00] <duch_kazatel> that'll do exactly the same thing.
[10:47:06] <Voyage> hm
[10:47:34] <Voyage> just for curiosity,  how to fix  <a href="<script>window.location.href</script>"></a>
[10:47:39] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[10:47:44] <Voyage> $('#refreshPage').click(function(){ window.location.reload(true) }); is nice
[10:47:56] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  what if I want to embed JS in html?
[10:47:56] <duch_kazatel> if you want to link back to the page itself, then you want to do $('#refreshPage').attr('href', window.location.href);  but that's not necessary if you want to just reload the page.
[10:48:04] <duch_kazatel> don't embed js in html.
[10:48:06] <duch_kazatel> it's a bad idea.
[10:48:34] <Voyage> I agree that its a bad idea but is there a way ?
[10:48:36] <Voyage> tod o it
[10:48:40] <Voyage> to do it
[10:48:53] <duch_kazatel> not in the way you want to.
[10:49:16] <Voyage> then how? (in any way to syntactically embed JS in html)
[10:49:37] <duch_kazatel> you cannot do anything like this: <a href="<script>window.location.href</script>"></a>
[10:49:58] <BillCriswell> Nice codes duch_kazatel.
[10:50:05] <duch_kazatel> my codes is clean.
[10:50:12] <BillCriswell> Beautiful codes.
[10:50:21] <duch_kazatel> such codes.  many fresh.  wow
[10:50:49] <duch_kazatel> i was behind a dodge pickup this morning that had the second "d" removed.  so it said "DO GE". i laughed.
[10:51:55] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  this says invalid no. of params, expected 0 $('#refreshPage').click(function(){ window.location.reload(true) });
[10:52:18] <duch_kazatel> where does it say that?
[10:52:27] <duch_kazatel> because it's workin' for me.
[10:52:30] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  so there is not way to put <script> inside html?
[10:52:38] <duch_kazatel> not in the way you want, no.
[10:52:44] <Voyage> k
[10:52:51] <duch_kazatel> you cannot use it as a placeholder.
[10:56:28] <BillCriswell> Man, tabs and tables just aren't meant for a small screen.
[10:57:06] <BillCriswell> COLUMNS just aren't made for small screens lol
[11:00:05] <duch_kazatel> eeewwww
[11:04:33] <nhulea> and were back !
[11:04:40] <duch_kazatel> woooo!
[11:10:39] <FernandoBasso> $( 'body' ).on( 'click', function ( evt ) { console.log( evt.target ); }()); <-- Why would evt be undefined, if I am running this code from firebug, after the page loaded (obviously) and the DOM is completely formed?
[11:11:53] <BillCriswell> FernandoBasso: That doesn't sound right.
[11:12:07] <BillCriswell> boaz: Oh wait.
[11:12:13] <decx> funky elipsis after your function is not necessary
[11:12:15] <BillCriswell> FernandoBasso: * What's with the ().
[11:12:17] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:12:21] <BillCriswell> boaz: My bad.
[11:12:44] <FernandoBasso> Yeah, that is the problem... Those extra ()...
[11:12:45] <FernandoBasso> Thansk.
[11:12:47] <boaz> np
[11:13:06] <FernandoBasso> I spent 10 minutes looking at that code...
[11:13:20] <BillCriswell> FernandoBasso: That's just causing the function to execute right away.
[11:13:35] <BillCriswell> Without the event actually happening.
[11:13:48] <FernandoBasso> BillCriswell: Indeed, that is the case.
[11:13:53] <duch_kazatel> IIFEs and all that.
[11:14:12] <BillCriswell> All them weird 4 letter combinations I somehow manage to keep mapped in my brain.
[11:14:14] <FernandoBasso> Then, of course, no element caused the click, so evt was undefined.
[11:16:21] <mia> newbie question: if I am cloning row in a table, do I have to reassign CSS for the row?
[11:16:32] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:16:56] <mia> what about dynamically creating the row, would I still need to wire up the css for that row
[11:17:00] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[11:17:03] <BillCriswell> Nope nope.
[11:17:05] <duch_kazatel> CSS will apply correctly.
[11:17:16] <duch_kazatel> css doesn't care when stuff was added/removed.
[11:17:26] <duch_kazatel> css is unfeeling and does not love.
[11:17:29] <mia> ahhhhhhhh! thanks!!!!
[11:17:30] <duch_kazatel> it is a robot.
[11:24:42] <duch_kazatel> welp this change touched 70+ files
[11:25:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Is that bad?
[11:25:41] <duch_kazatel> over 9,000 removals and 9,000 additions.
[11:25:46] <duch_kazatel> just a big change.
[11:27:58] <axilla> hi all, i have a icon i want to change to a different icon on mouse hove.
[11:28:00] <axilla> hover*
[11:28:02] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/fluffheadsr/11408213
[11:28:08] <axilla> that's the code i'm using, and it works.
[11:28:10] <duch_kazatel> axilla use css.
[11:28:23] <axilla> duch_kazatel: can you show me how, i've looked around can't figure it out.
[11:28:34] <duch_kazatel> a:hover{}
[11:28:40] <duch_kazatel> then put your changed properties in there.
[11:28:56] <axilla> yes but how do I load an icon where a <i> is targeted.
[11:28:58] <axilla> that's what I can't figure out
[11:29:08] <axilla> http://www.smithmcclain.com.php53-7.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/
[11:29:12] <axilla> that's the site i'm working on.
[11:29:17] <axilla> when i mouseover the images up top
[11:29:25] <axilla> it works, it changes to the Negative icon as it should
[11:29:30] <axilla> but instantly changes back to the original icon
[11:29:40] <axilla> instead of holding the icon while i'm still a:hovered.
[11:30:00] <duch_kazatel> ah, you're using some kind of icon library or something i'll bet.
[11:30:05] <axilla> yea
[11:30:08] <axilla> flaticons
[11:30:24] <axilla> my html is just <i class="flaticon-positive"></i>
[11:30:30] <axilla> the jquery is what i posted above.
[11:30:33] <duch_kazatel> either way, you should reread the docs on .hover() - the version you want takes two arguments.
[11:30:52] <duch_kazatel> and you want to explicitly add and remove the class, instead of using .toggle().
[11:30:58] <duch_kazatel> or toggleclass or whatever.
[11:31:23] <decx> you have multiple id feature2 on your site
[11:31:46] <duch_kazatel> $('a').hover(function(){$('i').addClass('flaticon-negative7')}, function(){$('i').removeClass('flaticon-negative7')});
[11:32:41] <axilla> rgr
[11:32:54] <duch_kazatel> but fix the multiple id problem.
[11:33:45] <axilla> woops
[11:35:31] <jklaus> hey guys.  I'm having some serious issues getting jquery datatables table tools working
[11:35:56] <jklaus> print will only render the top 40px or so of the table
[11:36:01] <jklaus> and none of the exports work
[11:50:57] <bberry> Cork: Around still?
[11:51:10] <_biff> could i open a text file and load to a textfield with jquery or js?
[11:51:13] <_biff> or it is restricted
[11:51:27] <_biff> so a local text file from my computer
[11:51:37] <duch_kazatel> _biff if a server serves it up, or the user uploads it via a form, that's kosher.
[11:51:51] <duch_kazatel> if you try to automatically access their hard drive for them, that is not kosher.
[11:52:21] <_biff> yes i thought but i wanted to solve this simpli open a text file from my machni and put the content into the textfield...
[11:52:30] <_biff> so i should put first the content to the server
[11:52:31] <_biff> rightM?
[11:52:44] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:52:49] <_biff> huhuh
[11:52:50] <_biff> ?:)
[11:52:50] <duch_kazatel> why are you trying to do that?
[11:52:55] <_biff> which
[11:52:57] <_biff> what
[11:53:09] <duch_kazatel> "simpli open a text file from my machni and put the content into the textfield..." - this
[11:53:40] <decx> filereader?
[11:53:50] <duch_kazatel> i really wish i knew what they wanted.
[11:54:10] <_biff> because ...if a customer write the text in a file, but he dont want to open first and copy paste to my page, instead he want top open on my webpage this file and put the filecontent to the textarea
[11:54:27] <duch_kazatel> okay, so you want them to be able to upload information from a text file.
[11:54:35] <duch_kazatel> what kind of information would this contain?
[11:54:55] <_biff> any text info
[11:55:03] <_biff> notes or anything
[11:55:17] <_biff> so he want to store this on my webpage this content...
[11:55:31] <duch_kazatel> is this like a paste service?
[11:55:35] <_biff> but instead opening on the computer and ctrl c ctrl v he want to open right now the file
[11:55:45] <_biff> no...its only a feature
[11:56:04] <_biff> this would simplify the handling
[11:56:10] <_biff> would make faster the process
[11:56:16] <bberry> is there a way to get this so that the text appears AFTER the checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/14/
[11:56:31] <bberry> (without having to make a special case in elemGen)
[11:56:42] <duch_kazatel> _biff just trying to understand the process.  it's possible to do what you want, but it's hard to know if it's the right thing in your case.
[11:57:12] <duch_kazatel> !mdn filereader
[11:57:14] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: FileReader - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[11:57:20] <_biff> duch_kazatel ok thanks but what are u mention
[11:57:27] <duch_kazatel> _biff read that link.
[11:57:30] <_biff> aha
[11:57:38] <_biff> thx
[11:58:05] <bberry> duch_kazatel check out that jsfiddle. maybe youll get a kick out of my little doohickey
[11:58:29] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:58:36] <bberry> lol
[11:58:45] <bberry> or not haha
[11:58:56] <duch_kazatel> i'm actually not a big fan of markup alternatives.  there was a dude who wrote a JSON to HTML thing a while ago.
[11:59:06] <bberry> yeah im not either
[12:00:10] <duch_kazatel> for your question, you might need to consider structuring your markup so the label is a separate element or create a special case.
[12:00:16] <decx> what the hell is going on there
[12:00:22] <duch_kazatel> don't have time atm to read through it all though.
[12:00:27] <bberry> its ok :P
[12:01:09] <bberry> the html turns into <label>texthere<input type="checkbox"></input></label>. not sure how i could put the text after the input instead of before.
[12:01:41] <bberry> probably will need a special case
[12:02:05] <bberry> decx: basically just converts json to html
[12:02:11] <decx> prepend the children instead of appending
[12:02:30] <decx> if (e.children) { elm.prepend(elemGen(e.children)); }
[12:02:59] <bberry> lol that works
[12:03:02] <bberry> nice
[12:04:01] <hugh_oxford> hello
[12:05:27] <duch_kazatel> hola
[12:05:35] <duch_kazatel> oh shit i have to get lunch at some point.
[12:05:37] <hugh_oxford> Hello, can anyone explain to my why $(this) remembers previous elements when bound by delegate to events?
[12:05:53] <bberry> decx: i can do this too http://jsfiddle.net/93wTe/16/
[12:06:38] <duch_kazatel> hugh_oxford hrm?  are you still using .delegate()?
[12:07:14] <hugh_oxford> I have a lot of elements with the same class. I bind a click event to them which changes their val(). But when I click a new element, previous elements change as well.
[12:07:28] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ hugh_oxford
[12:07:28] <b-ot> hugh_oxford: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:07:51] <hugh_oxford> OK, hang on
[12:08:11] <StephenS> fadeIn re-appears when I hover on other element
[12:08:19] <StephenS> why is that?
[12:08:47] <StephenS> $(".maindiv").mouseover(function() {
[12:08:47] <StephenS>     $(this).find(".findclass").fadeIn('fast');
[12:08:55] <StephenS> with .show it works perfectly fine.
[12:08:56] <duch_kazatel> noes not in the channel pls.
[12:09:54] <hugh_oxford> Here it is...http://jsfiddle.net/cdLbb/
[12:10:01] <StephenS> ...?
[12:10:13] <hugh_oxford> I've removed the ajax stuff.
[12:10:38] <duch_kazatel> StephenS it's better if you provide an actual example.
[12:10:51] <duch_kazatel> hugh_oxford what version of jquery are you using?
[12:11:06] <hugh_oxford> 1.7 - I have to for Drupal 7
[12:11:31] <StephenS> fine
[12:12:00] <hugh_oxford> Every time I click an element with the class '.change_basket_product_table_button', EVERY previously clicked element changes its val();
[12:12:14] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/cdLbb/1/
[12:12:17] <duch_kazatel> use .on() intead.
[12:13:05] <duch_kazatel> also, don't use new Object(); - just use an object literal
[12:13:59] <hugh_oxford> duch_kazatel, I can't use on()
[12:14:08] <duch_kazatel> hugh_oxford yes you can - it was added in 1.7
[12:16:04] <GloriaM> hi
[12:16:15] <StephenS> duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/K6cP6/
[12:16:34] <hugh_oxford> Thanks, will do that
[12:16:46] <StephenS> there, it does not work on jsfiddle on hover from some reason, but it hides when you hover over textarea or rea class or any other element.
[12:19:03] <GloriaM> I'm trying to make a XMLHttpRequest but it keeps throwing me Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier  >> http://pastebin.com/r0hqAwpF
[12:19:32] <jklaus> can anyone help me problem solve this stupid POS lol
[12:19:43] <StephenS> so duch_kazatel ?
[12:19:45] <duch_kazatel> StephenS why are you binding like that?
[12:19:52] <StephenS> how to bind?
[12:20:08] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing inside of that function?
[12:20:45] <StephenS> just remove function
[12:20:47] <StephenS> my bad, I call that function on ready method,.
[12:21:01] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[12:21:17] <alaing> evening
[12:21:29] <duch_kazatel> StephenS you could just use this: http://jsfiddle.net/K6cP6/1/
[12:21:37] <duch_kazatel> or use .hover()
[12:22:21] <alaing> or .on() :-P
[12:22:26] <duch_kazatel> or .on()
[12:22:40] <alaing> I prefer .on()
[12:22:41] <duch_kazatel> the .hover() version is here: http://jsfiddle.net/K6cP6/2/
[12:23:09] <duch_kazatel> i usually prefer it as well, but but what he's doing is so close to just using .hover().
[12:23:26] <jklaus> does anyone in here have experience with jquery datatables?
[12:23:31] <jklaus> I'm having a hell of a time getting it working
[12:23:38] <jklaus> its finding the flash file
[12:23:52] <alaing> linky?
[12:23:54] <jklaus> I think the issue may have to do with z-index issues
[12:24:04] <GloriaM> someone has experience with this?
[12:24:04] <GloriaM> I'm trying to make a XMLHttpRequest but it keeps throwing me Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier  >> http://pastebin.com/r0hqAwpF
[12:24:45] <StephenS> duch_kazatel that does not work
[12:24:46] <alaing> GloriaM: have you tried #javascript
[12:24:56] <StephenS> hover over other elements
[12:25:01] <alaing> this isn't exactly a Jquery question
[12:25:15] <duch_kazatel> StephenS could you explain specifically what you want, then?
[12:25:21] <StephenS> my main problem still remain
[12:25:36] <StephenS> to red background remain all the time, while im inside hidden-close div?
[12:25:50] <StephenS> hover over textarea, it will leave.
[12:26:04] <duch_kazatel> not in the .hover() example i posted.
[12:26:06] <NoiseEee> GloriaM: why arent you using jquery methods?
[12:26:28] <StephenS> yeah in your example it does not even show when I hover on textarea lol
[12:26:37] <duch_kazatel> StephenS http://jsfiddle.net/K6cP6/2/
[12:26:48] <duch_kazatel> i tried that in ff, ie, and chrome - works fine in all three.
[12:27:02] <NoiseEee> GloriaM: also, you don't write to an iframe via someIFrameID.innerHTML
[12:27:38] <StephenS> yes that works
[12:27:44] <StephenS> but why do you need another function?
[12:27:45] <alaing> NoiseEee: GloriaM is asking in the #javascript
[12:27:46] <GloriaM> I'm now trying to use     $('#otherpage').load('frame.html', function()
[12:27:49] <GloriaM> but I get the same result
[12:28:20] <NoiseEee> GloriaM: you don't have a closing bracket on addEventListener
[12:29:07] <ngl> Question: Can I inspect the contents of a zip on the client side/in-browser pre-upload?
[12:29:19] <duch_kazatel> answer: why?
[12:29:20] <alaing> NoiseEee: well spotted: line 6 :-)
[12:29:20] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:29:30] <NoiseEee> ngl: probably with the FileAPI and a js .zip library
[12:30:00] <alaing> ngl: I would do it server side
[12:30:03] <ngl> Thanks. I just need to ensure a zip I upload to mongo has the expected files in it each time.
[12:30:33] <duch_kazatel> http://gildas-lormeau.github.io/zip.js/
[12:30:45] <alaing> ngl: might have issues with zip compressions and what if the person password protects /encrypts it?
[12:31:05] <duch_kazatel> alaing then the file would fail anyway and he could use that as a rejection reason :)
[12:31:09] <ngl> Well, then I just won't do it :)
[12:31:31] <alaing> duch_kazatel: hmmmm interesting...
[12:31:41] <alaing> duch_kazatel: thanks for the linky
[12:31:42] <ngl> Reading up on zip.js now. Thanks. Couldn't get any results via googling.
[12:31:44] <StephenS> duch_kazatel what was the issue
[12:31:53] <duch_kazatel> StephenS huh?
[12:31:55] <StephenS> why did you put a new function, it works now, but why?
[12:32:10] <duch_kazatel> StephenS because your original event bindings were incorrect.
[12:33:02] <duch_kazatel> you wanted mouseenter and mouseleave.  .hover() takes care of that for you.
[12:33:06] <alaing> stupid question buy do any of you use github and contribute to a js plugin or whatever?
[12:33:21] <duch_kazatel> i used github for work, alaing
[12:33:36] <StephenS> ic
[12:33:37] <alaing> duch_kazatel: so not for pleasure then :-D
[12:33:38] <duch_kazatel> and have a few repos up there i think.
[12:33:40] <GloriaM> solved it
[12:33:41] <GloriaM> ;-)
[12:33:43] <nhulea> yeah
[12:33:46] <ngl> yes bunch for work here too... and for personal projects, i.e. games :)
[12:33:47] <alaing> oh yes you love work :-D
[12:33:57] <GloriaM> still, I'm trying to find a way to play a sound automatically on Android
[12:33:59] <nhulea> alaing: mine its really messy thoough
[12:34:25] <alaing> I'm really keen to try get more involve and contribute
[12:34:43] <alaing> but have no idea where to start
[12:34:54] <alaing> I got a github )and bitbucket) accounts
[12:34:57] <nhulea> I started forking projects and
[12:35:07] <nhulea> messing with them to see what I could get going
[12:35:19] <duch_kazatel> places like this chat room are a good place to start.  helping folks out.  you can also work on the documentation for jquery - that's a big job, too.
[12:35:26] <nhulea> there a shitload of awesome nodejs projects on there
[12:35:37] <GloriaM> someone knows anything about that?
[12:35:47] <alaing> nhulea: not to clued up on nodejs yet
[12:36:09] <nhulea> yeah well its pretty fun once you get going
[12:36:16] <alaing> duch_kazatel: yeah I like helping out here when i get moments
[12:36:40] <duch_kazatel> GloriaM in what browser?
[12:37:31] <alaing> So looking forward to jQuery Conf in UK next month
[12:37:34] <ngl> alaing: you can play with nodejs with an IDE on Cloud 9 IDE... just for fun.
[12:37:43] <nhulea> isnt autplay disable in most mobile pbrowers?
[12:37:50] <nhulea> *browsers
[12:37:55] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[12:38:08] <alaing> I went last year and it was fantastic
[12:38:19] <nhulea> maybe do a trick and get the user to click something ?
[12:38:42] <nhulea> yeah cloud 9 is the shit
[12:38:51] <axilla> duch_kazatel: thanks, got it working beautifully
[12:39:05] <nhulea> but if you install it and get it running that part of the fun too
[12:39:11] <duch_kazatel> axilla of course!
[12:39:25] <GloriaM> any browser?
[12:39:34] <GloriaM> duch_kazatel: any browser, I want it on all browsers
[12:39:48] <duch_kazatel> GloriaM back up - what are you actually trying to do?
[12:39:49] <GloriaM> well, most common ones at least. Android Chrome, and Android browser
[12:39:57] <duch_kazatel> what's the project?
[12:40:08] <GloriaM> duch_kazatel: I'm trying to play a background music all the time
[12:40:12] <drej> ew
[12:40:13] <drej> NO
[12:40:14] <drej> stop
[12:40:16] <drej> nobody help GloriaM
[12:40:32] <GloriaM> awwww
[12:40:35] <drej> let's all work towards a better internet
[12:40:37] <drej> one without background music
[12:40:43] <duch_kazatel> GloriaM that is going to be next to impossible to do, and is an awful idea.
[12:40:46] <drej> if you help, youre enabling
[12:40:51] <drej> dont be an enabler
[12:40:55] <GloriaM> it's for a game actually
[12:40:59] <drej> NO
[12:41:08] <drej> sorry i may have had a lot of coffee today
[12:41:12] <GloriaM> but I want to! Its just for my tests
[12:41:22] <nhulea> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11758651/autostart-html5-video-using-android-4-browser?answertab=active#tab-top
[12:41:30] <duch_kazatel> noooooooooooooo!!!!!!
[12:41:31] <drej> just to show you guys how much coffee ive had
[12:41:34] <drej> this happened in another channel: http://pastebin.com/DX6x77cx
[12:41:36] <nhulea> maybe you can try that method
[12:41:55] <duch_kazatel> that's bash-worthy
[12:42:22] <nhulea> what channel is thatb ?
[12:42:28] <drej> #css
[12:42:31] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[12:42:32] <duch_kazatel> http://bash.org/
[12:43:04] <GloriaM> so it always need user interaction
[12:43:06] <ngl> ha. "...in 1972, a man by the name of Al Gore invented a series of tubes..."
[12:43:11] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: that shit is awesome
[12:43:20] <duch_kazatel> GloriaM sure, like a "start game" button
[12:43:20] <alaing> cloud 9 looks interesting
[12:43:44] <drej> ngl :)
[12:43:56] <GloriaM> then will get it working
[12:43:58] <drej> duch_kazatel i was going to but i ahve to remove the timestamps
[12:44:25] <duch_kazatel> easy.
[12:44:39] <GloriaM> oh and drej = you should not be that aggressive on the internet. I'm a male and pretty sure I have a dick thicker than yours.
[12:44:45] <ngl> It is a fun place to start, but the Windows installer for node is a breeze and, of course, it is simple for most Linux systems too. Then, there is a package manager, npm... very easy to use.
[12:44:46] <GloriaM> Respect the penis.
[12:44:56] <drej> GloriaM wat?
[12:45:10] <duch_kazatel> drej - http://pastebin.com/QZ1CfqCn
[12:45:15] <duch_kazatel> amazing what st2 can do.
[12:45:17] <GloriaM> ANYWAY. Glad to have it solved.
[12:45:19] <GloriaM> Thanks duch_kazatel
[12:45:21] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[12:45:26] <drej> haha duch_kazatel  thanks
[12:45:47] <drej> "Invalid submission"
[12:45:49] <drej> i give up
[12:45:54] <duch_kazatel> wow.
[12:45:55] <duch_kazatel> bummer.
[12:46:07] * drej shrugs
[12:46:12] <acidjazz> http:///iwantdolbyatmos.dolby.com <- the survey wont work in IE9 . im done trying to fix it.. anyone who knows how to fix it ill paypal cash to send me a msg
[12:46:30] <acidjazz> s/to//
[12:47:07] <nhulea> alaing: there is also this http://jsapp.us/ its alot more paired down I feel like its easier to focus on what your doing
[12:47:21] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz where's the javascript for this?
[12:47:49] <boolieman> hey there i have a pretty straightforward question, is there a way with jquery UI to refresh a position, im having an issue with appending a draggable to a position for a revert function but it drifts the draggable out from under the cursor
[12:47:56] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Can you disable the redirect to browser? I have IE8 here at work.
[12:48:04] <BillCriswell> redirect to /browser*
[12:49:14] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: If I remember right it was survey.js line 18?
[12:49:25] <BillCriswell> or 13...
[12:49:29] <BillCriswell> Not sure why I remember that
[12:50:24] <duch_kazatel> where is the event binding though?
[12:50:34] <StephenS> jaoj jaoj
[12:51:09] <Xgear> I am facing a small issue and I am not entirely sure what is the cause, my sites jquery-stuff works perfectly fine on my local copy, but when I move it to my test site it seems to partially work.
[12:51:30] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz the html looks like it's updating the html.
[12:51:40] <duch_kazatel> err, the js looks like it's updating the html.
[12:52:04] <duch_kazatel> Xgear do you have any errors in the console?
[12:52:11] <Xgear> None whatsover
[12:52:38] <Xgear> And everything seems to be loaded just fine (from the console's resources stuff)
[12:52:47] <duch_kazatel> what isn't working then?
[12:52:52] <Xgear> But some event listener dont seem to be working
[12:53:22] <boolieman> Xgear: did you run a check to see if jQuery loaded in proper sequence?
[12:53:24] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz do you have a fallback for old IE?
[12:53:36] <Xgear> In all honesty, I couldnt tell 100% for sure. For instance my Tabs are working just fine, but some modal dialogs arent working
[12:54:05] <duch_kazatel> Xgear and you're using document readies and whatnot?
[12:54:08] <Xgear> boolieman, its the first thing to load, its working perfectly fine on windows, but on *nix it seems to work half-ass
[12:54:23] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz yeah you need a fallback for IE8 - that's your problem.
[12:54:45] <Xgear> I thought I had missed some files to upload, so I deleted everything and moved my local directory as-is to double check and still it seems to be faulty
[12:55:05] <duch_kazatel> "its working perfectly fine on windows, but on *nix it seems to work half-ass"
[12:55:08] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make sense.
[12:55:30] <Xgear> If it made any sense I prolly wouldnt have dropped here asking for some guidance :P
[12:55:46] <duch_kazatel> i mean the statement doesn't make sense - what do you mean by that?
[12:56:06] <boolieman> Xgear have you tried doing a load check ex if(jQuery) etc?
[12:56:31] <duch_kazatel> just use a document ready instead.
[12:57:00] <Xgear> I was working on my site locally (on windows) now I am done with what I had to do here so I moved it to nix-based web server for someone else to check it out
[12:57:25] <Xgear> When I moved it to my web server it doesnt completely work. For instance, my tabs are working fine, a carousel is working fine, but some event listeners arent
[12:57:33] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't matter.
[12:57:40] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a race condition.
[12:57:54] <Xgear> Oh... didnt think of that... could make sense
[12:57:55] <Xgear> Hate those
[12:57:56] <duch_kazatel> are you able to share it with us?
[12:58:55] <duch_kazatel> lunchtime.  enjoy folks.
[12:59:36] <Xgear> Sure but I have to run apparently
[12:59:40] <Xgear> I'll drop by once I get home again
[12:59:50] <Xgear> I'll check the race condition thing
[13:04:47] <phelix> Anyone have some advice on some easy to use and configure jquery sliders. Not like a slideshow slider but that you drag and slide and it updates a number.
[13:06:32] <il> how can i get the specific class index of an element?
[13:06:59] <il> say I have <span class="abc">1</span> <span class="abc">2</span> <span class="abc">3</span>
[13:07:02] <il> How would I get 3?
[13:10:20] <BillCriswell> phelix: jQuery UI works.
[13:10:34] <phelix> looking at that one now
[13:10:36] <BillCriswell> il: If they all have the same parent $(this).index()
[13:10:38] <phelix> probably the best one to use
[13:10:52] <il> already tried .index
[13:10:56] <il> tried :eq
[13:11:04] <il> tried [i] inside an each
[13:11:13] <BillCriswell> il: Do they have the same parent?
[13:11:15] <il> yep
[13:11:57] <BillCriswell> $('.abc').eq(2) would give you the third one.
[13:13:20] <BillCriswell> il: http://jsbin.com/gidotofo/1/edit?html,js,output
[13:13:30] <il> .eq() worked like a charm
[13:13:34] <il> I had been using :eq
[13:13:40] <il> derp
[13:14:10] <BillCriswell> :eq works too.
[13:14:29] <il> alright well i couldn't figure out how
[13:14:33] <BillCriswell> Just know the index is 0 based.
[13:14:38] <il> did for .eq though and that's all i need
[13:14:43] <il> isn't everything?
[13:14:55] <BillCriswell> nth-child(3) wouldn't be.
[13:15:00] <il> ah
[13:15:10] <BillCriswell> Javascript is usually, CSS not so much.
[13:15:16] <il> right
[13:29:15] <BillCriswell>  It sure is miserable in Philadelphia today.
[13:29:49] <__joshua__> but its always sunny
[13:31:52] <BillCriswell> That's what the media wants you to think.
[13:32:00] <acidjazz> BillCriswell: sorry i cannot its live
[13:32:26] <acidjazz> and duch thanks for hte input
[13:33:33] <duch_lunch> back
[13:35:28] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: Oh word.
[13:35:55] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz you figure it out?
[13:38:00] <datarecal> hey guys I am trying to format datepicker : http://paste2.org/zeYU2xZk but the console is just showing : MMMM D, YYYY - MMMM D, YYYY  any thoughts on what the issue could be ?
[13:38:25] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: there u are
[13:38:34] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: no ive been trying to confirm the html gets updated in the console
[13:39:18] <acidjazz> i cant exec any jquery in the console
[13:39:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah, the html is all solid - i'm seeing classes getting added and removed.
[13:39:56] <duch_kazatel> but your css doesn't support old browsers.
[13:40:10] <acidjazz> so you're saying my ie9 issue is css
[13:40:15] <acidjazz> let me cehcek that out
[13:40:16] <acidjazz> check
[13:40:17] <acidjazz> *
[13:40:22] <duch_kazatel> well, part of it at least.
[13:40:31] <duch_kazatel> that's where i'd start.
[13:41:05] <nhulea> acidjazz: try using this http://css3pie.com/
[13:41:14] <duch_kazatel> mmm pie
[13:41:24] <nhulea> tasty ie tricks
[13:42:05] <nhulea> but I think modernizer with some fallback prob is the best idea maybe ?
[13:42:10] <nhulea> acidjazz: ^
[13:42:16] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:42:18] <erming_> fak ie
[13:42:24] <duch_kazatel> i like IE11.
[13:42:25] <duch_kazatel> 10's okay.
[13:42:28] <erming_> oh, true
[13:42:38] <erming_> i like the newer versions too (very responsive on touch screens!)
[13:42:41] <duch_kazatel> 8 and 9 were in the right direction.
[13:42:47] <erming_> but ie7 etc..
[13:42:56] <nhulea> yeah I like 11 too
[13:43:04] <duch_kazatel> sure - if firefox had to still support FF 3.6, you'd be just as mad at them, too ;)
[13:43:11] <acidjazz> its my linear gradient maybe
[13:43:15] <erming_> caused me too much pain.. clients wanting all the fancy stuff, but run IE7 on their XP computer
[13:43:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm liking FF 29 today
[13:43:47] <nhulea> and your animation
[13:44:09] <nhulea> anything that is css3 probably wont work
[13:44:11] <erming_> but what i meant was more like: forget about stuff looking shiet in ie
[13:44:25] <erming_> the problem isn't IE7 itself, but rather the userbase
[13:46:51] <duch_kazatel> damn i'm feeling good after getting my upgrade code into a PR for other people to poke at.
[13:47:12] <erming_> anyone know any good jQuery window manager plugin? Basically, what I want is draggable windows, inside a container div. Support for maximized and tiling is required, or else I might as well built it myself :>
[13:47:47] <duch_kazatel> x.sr.unh.edu/jquery-wm/
[13:47:51] <duch_kazatel> http://x.sr.unh.edu/jquery-wm/
[13:48:27] <erming_> yeah, i've seen it.. but it's weird in my browser (Chrome).. When dragging the outline just starts to spasm and so on
[13:48:40] <duch_kazatel> you'd probably need to upgrade it.
[13:48:44] <erming_> but it got maximize. nice
[13:49:55] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: http://atmos.256.sh/ i made hte filled class a solid orange instead of a gradient
[13:50:21] <duch_kazatel> there's your fallback.
[13:51:09] <acidjazz> is it working for you?
[13:51:45] <acidjazz> im not seein it
[13:52:07] <Tomashe> Hey guys i need some advice, i gt that website : http://www.lasso.co.il/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91 , below all the small images there is a button that should open a map (google map) i copy paste the iframe from google maps but from some reason it apear bad. as u can see . any suggestions?
[13:52:15] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz one sec.

[13:52:25] <il> Tomashe,
[13:52:38] <il> co.il
[13:52:45] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: im also not seeing the html update :/.. course i dont know if i can trust ie9s inspector
[13:52:49] <erming_> initial reaction: holy schmoly, that page is backwards!
[13:52:50] <erming_> :D
[13:53:08] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz i'm using IE11's emulator.
[13:53:09] <duch_kazatel> hrm.
[13:53:18] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: same
[13:53:19] <acidjazz> edge
[13:53:47] <datarecal> trying to figure out why this code will not format the date properly in the console.log part : http://jsfiddle.net/s3h5L/499/ the datepicker doesnt seem to work at all in jsfiddle though
[13:54:18] <acidjazz> There are seven questions you need to ask yourself when using the DARPA logo.
[13:54:18] <acidjazz> 1. Is the logo the official DARPA art?
[13:54:18] <acidjazz> 2. Am I retaining the look and feel of our identity?
[13:54:19] <acidjazz> woops
[13:54:22] <acidjazz> mispaste
[13:56:55] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: HA.

[13:58:32] <erming_> TViernion: could you show your code?
[13:59:36] <duch_kazatel> TViernion by escaping them.

[14:02:08] <Sharperte> How do you read from a text file line by line and make it to scroll inside a jquery ticker ? Couldn't find any examples.
[14:03:16] <erming_> Sharperte: which part are you having problem with?
[14:03:21] <duch_kazatel> Sharperte look at the filereader api.
[14:03:58] <Sharperte> erming here
[14:03:59] <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.
[14:04:12] <Sharperte> https://gist.github.com/Csharper1972/11390229
[14:04:19] <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[14:04:24] <duch_kazatel> can you set that up on a fiddle?
[14:04:30] <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling.
[14:04:57] <duch_kazatel> aaah i see the problem - you're not approaching this right at all :)
[14:05:35] <Sharperte> What i want is to read from the text file lets say each time two lines and scroll them up inside the Latest News red box of demo3 using easyticker
[14:05:53] <duch_kazatel> right - that's the wrong way to do it.
[14:06:28] <Sharperte> I could use the demo3 and easyTicker alone with manual lines i added using ul tags. Worked fine but now i want to implent my text file reading code.
[14:06:48] <duch_kazatel> right - your text reader is the big problem.
[14:07:06] <Sharperte> duch if you could fix my code show me how it should be and explain what did i do wrong ?
[14:07:19] <duch_kazatel> i don't have time to do that - i can explain the approach though :)
[14:07:31] <TViernion> okay duch_kazatel i see what you mean
[14:07:55] <duch_kazatel> you should do one of two things.  the wrong way to do this is to simply load up the entire text file and compare the old and new, then update from there.
[14:08:14] <duch_kazatel> the SMART way, though, is to setup an endpoint on your server that responds with the content you want.
[14:09:39] <Sharperte> Ok sound logic. Not that i have a clue yet how to do it.
[14:09:54] <duch_kazatel> what server-side language are you using?
[14:10:29] <Sharperte> javascript
[14:10:34] <duch_kazatel> node?
[14:11:31] <Sharperte> No just added the script to my site . Just as it is here https://gist.github.com/Csharper1972/11390229
[14:11:53] <duch_kazatel> Sharperte ... so what server-side language are you using?
[14:12:06] <Sharperte> The jsbin.powew.js part
[14:12:10] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: no dice?
[14:12:52] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz sorry man.
[14:13:24] <duch_kazatel> Sharperte what programming language are you using to dynamically write out parts of your page?
[14:13:31] <Sharperte> html
[14:13:51] <duch_kazatel> okay. then the API is not something you can do.
[14:13:54] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: this bugs my nightmare
[14:14:14] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet.
[14:17:37] <TViernion> duch_kazatel : like this ? http://fpaste.org/97942/80621913/
[14:18:12] <duch_kazatel> TViernion you could have also done  var promised_date_update = encodeURIComponent(ival("promise_date"));
[14:18:15] <erming_> TViernion: wrap the whole $(this).attr('href') + clean_promised_date inside the encode instead
[14:18:45] <erming_> no, nvm
[14:18:51] <erming_> don't :)
[14:20:00] <TViernion> http://fpaste.org/97944/39880639/
[14:20:13] <duch_kazatel> TViernion using jsfiddle makes us all happier here :)
[14:21:11] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: did you at least still see the html updatinG?
[14:21:37] <TViernion> duch_kazatel problem is... it will not work properly.. asi've got a date picker pulling this information
[14:21:40] <TViernion> but okay
[14:22:07] <duch_kazatel> acidjazz sorry - i had to get onto other stuff.
[14:22:14] <duch_kazatel> TViernion then you can decode it ;)

[14:22:59] <TViernion> http://jsfiddle.net/MW8W6/1/  there you go
[14:23:20] <duch_kazatel> TViernion i all ready told you how you fix it the other direction.

[14:24:08] <TViernion> the problem is duch it's adding NaN to the URL instead of the date format
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> TViernion okay, then you've got another problem.
[14:24:50] <duch_kazatel> can you get a functioning example, but have it output the date to the console?
[14:25:07] <TViernion> im in chrome... how would i do that?
[14:25:28] <duch_kazatel> by using jsfiddle and outputting through console.log() instead of mucking with the URL?
[14:25:52] <TViernion> im going with no, as i've never used jsfiddle.. nor used the console.log()
[14:26:29] <duch_kazatel> hard to help then.
[14:26:58] <erming_> TViernion: jsfiddle.net
[14:27:07] <erming_> it's good to know how to use it, will help you later on
[14:27:26] <TViernion> well... im sure it will...
[14:27:35] <duch_kazatel> it will.
[14:27:39] <duch_kazatel> otherwise we can't really help you.
[14:27:53] <andrewanderson> hey so.. i have a really weird question that i don't know how to phrase
[14:27:54] <erming_> TViernion: here's an old example i found in my history: http://jsfiddle.net/yR3RS/1/
[14:27:58] <TViernion> when using JSHint it says "good job"
[14:28:06] <duch_kazatel> that's nice :)
[14:28:25] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson try asking :)
[14:28:27] <erming_> the problem is not the code.. the problem is the values are not correct, resulting in NaN
[14:28:45] <andrewanderson> i have an ajax modal that has javascript inside it.. i'm using tagsinput library, and it works fine if the modal is opened after the page.. but if i close the modal and re-open the modal, the tagsinput library assigns a new ID to the input, i'm thinking because of the "tag input already exists" conflict
[14:28:51] <TViernion> well.. the value="04/11/2014"
[14:29:06] <TViernion> thats the date.  If i put in there 04112014 it works just fine
[14:29:26] <TViernion> thats manually keying the date.. but that's going to work.
[14:29:27] <erming_> TViernion: if you write this in your console: console.log(encodeURIComponent("04/11/2014"));
[14:29:27] <andrewanderson> http://tingls.com/videos/3d-virtual-haircut-in-russian-asmr this is the website in question, if you click on "help this video"
[14:29:40] <ngl> duch_kazatel: Thanks for turning me on to zip.js. Took awhile to get it integrated into my zip uploader, but it is perfectly what I needed! Almost off of work and wanted to thank you again.
[14:29:42] <erming_> F12 to bring up console in Chrome
[14:29:55] <andrewanderson> when you load the modal first, and inspect code, it's #drafttags, but if you close the modal and re-open, tagsinput creates a slug for the field instead
[14:30:05] <andrewanderson> how do i work around this?
[14:30:24] <duch_kazatel> ngl glad i could help.
[14:30:49] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson what is the actual problem?
[14:30:50] <TViernion> 04%2F14%2F2014
[14:30:52] <duch_kazatel> oh nvm
[14:31:01] <ngl> :) I'll buy you a beer or ten if you're ever in STL, MO. Have a good one.
[14:31:13] <andrewanderson> duch_kazatel: i can't get the value of the field when using it as a form, because tagsinput changes the ID of the input
[14:31:20] <erming_> TViernion: now try console.log("http://url.com/" + encodeURIComponent("04/11/2014"));
[14:31:31] <andrewanderson> and it only occurs when the modal has been once before and closed
[14:32:07] <StephenS> get a line
[14:32:48] <TViernion> http://magrethia.com/actions.php?do=set_promised&promised_date=04%2F11%2F2014
[14:33:12] <erming_> andrewanderson: maybe you could store a reference to the field when the page loads, and use that reference later, even after the ID changed
[14:33:34] <andrewanderson> erming_: less abstractly put?
[14:33:36] <erming_> like: var field = $("#currentInputID");
[14:33:50] <erming_> then you use field.val(); later
[14:33:52] <andrewanderson> tagsinput creates a random slug though
[14:33:59] <andrewanderson> i guess i could attach a name to it
[14:34:10] <duch_kazatel> what's up with the random slugs here?
[14:34:17] <andrewanderson> dunno
[14:34:20] <duch_kazatel> you said you're showing a modal, right?
[14:34:24] <andrewanderson> yeah
[14:34:31] <duch_kazatel> what modal lib are you using?
[14:34:36] <andrewanderson> foundation reveal
[14:34:38] <TViernion> So, the "code" works... it's just not putting together right on my end... somewhere..
[14:34:51] <duch_kazatel> TViernion sounds like it.
[14:35:00] <duch_kazatel> and it's not "code" ;) it's real.
[14:35:31] <andrewanderson> let me put it this way.. is there a way to call javascript once, when the modal is loaded, and not anymore?
[14:35:32] <phelix> http://justgage.com/ under demo's and then Customize Style option on the left. Anyone have any idea how he is getting that drop shadow on the top middle graph? I am using his same options and I can not get my shadow like this at all.
[14:36:06] <TViernion> it has to be something with the /
[14:36:07] <duch_kazatel> andrewanderson that's kind of what happens?  not sure what you mean by that.
[14:36:19] <erming_> andrewanderson, i have a hacky solution for you, haha
[14:36:22] <TViernion> b/c i just manually keyed in 04112014 hit submit and walah.. it's passed through fine
[14:36:24] <andrewanderson> erming_: let's hear it
[14:36:31] <duch_kazatel> *viola, TViernion ;)
[14:36:38] <erming_> $("div[id*='idName']");
[14:36:39] <TViernion> no.. im saying walah
[14:36:46] <duch_kazatel> what does that mean?
[14:36:52] <erming_> that selects all divs where the id _ends_ with "idName"
[14:36:55] <TViernion> it's texan
[14:37:01] <TViernion> :)
[14:37:02] <duch_kazatel> wat
[14:37:08] <duch_kazatel> *voila i meant.
[14:37:10] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[14:37:15] <erming_> you could use that selector to get the input.. $("input[id*='real_id']");
[14:37:19] <fronix> Trying to append some html code after a ajax GET but I can't seem to make it work, something I'm missing? http://jsfiddle.net/hrjjx/
[14:37:20] <andrewanderson> that works
[14:37:45] <duch_kazatel> frojnd you have to do it within the success callback.
[14:37:55] <duch_kazatel> also: use .done() and .fail() instead of success and error.
[14:37:58] <duch_kazatel> err, fronix
[14:38:07] <zylophone> mhh, is there a difference between var foo = '' and var foo = "" ?
[14:38:21] <duch_kazatel> zylophone the quotes being used.
[14:38:25] <duch_kazatel> nothing functionally different though.
[14:38:30] <TViernion> so duch_kazatel or erming any thoughts as to why without the / in the date it works fine?
[14:38:40] <zylophone> ok thanks. i know php uses the quotes differently
[14:38:52] <fronix> duch_kazatel, ahh ofcourse
[14:38:57] <fronix> duch_kazatel, thanks
[14:39:00] <duch_kazatel> fronix sure
[14:39:01] <erming_> zylophone: they work exactly the same, BUT, you can mix them like this: var tag = "<a href='index.html'>"; and so on
[14:39:12] <TViernion> it's almost like it's trying to divide it.. or subtract it.
[14:39:13] <duch_kazatel> TViernion sounds like you're using to input that as a number instead of a string?
[14:39:15] <erming_> that's one use case for different quotations
[14:39:44] <duch_kazatel> erming_ you can also do var tag = '<a href=\'index.html\'>'; but that looks funny.
[14:39:52] <TViernion> b/c if i do 04-11-2014 it does the same thing
[14:40:33] <erming_> i've been doing "<something=\"\">" alot.. but i've recently stopped doing that, heh.. yeah, looks weird, and harder to spot errors
[14:40:56] <erming_> TViernion maybe you should use something other than "/" ?
[14:41:14] <erming_> and when you later fetch the value, just replace, for example, "-" with "/"
[14:41:42] <erming_> the URL will look with lots of "%F2" anyway
[14:41:53] <TViernion> it's a date... i kind of can't
[14:41:58] <TViernion> even - does the same thing
[14:42:26] <erming_> www.datetime.com/1%2F2%2F3 vs www.datetime.com/1-2-3
[14:45:20] <zylophone> erming_/ duch_kazatel thanks
[14:45:26] <yani> how to detect if ajax get fails because of cors?
[14:45:27] <erming_> :)
[14:45:31] <TViernion> erming it even does the NaN on a manual 04-11-2014 entry
[14:45:47] <erming_> encodeURIComponent("04-11-2014") ?
[14:46:05] <erming_> and where do you get NaN? when using $.attr("href", new_url) ?
[14:46:47] <TViernion> yes
[14:50:07] <erming_> TViernion: http://jsfiddle.net/h4NwC/
[14:51:03] <erming_> something has to be wrong with the value coming from ival(). because as you can see here, it works perfectly fine when entering the date manually
[14:51:23] <erming_> using this example, see if you can debug your problem
[14:51:33] <zylophone> how do i select elements which have a certain content? e.g.to select all child spans of .foo  that have text asdf: $('.foo > span').text('asdf');
[14:51:59] <duch_kazatel> zylophone don't do that.
[14:52:00] <duch_kazatel> it's slow.
[14:52:05] <erming_> https://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[14:52:10] <duch_kazatel> noooooooo.
[14:52:20] <erming_> Google is pretty cool
[14:52:24] <Es0teric> does anyone know how to filter out duplicate items in a jquery object?
[14:52:32] <zylophone> mhh, back to the drawing board then
[14:52:37] <Es0teric> well in an array is the best question
[14:52:53] <TViernion> im working on modifying erming
[14:53:12] <zylophone> but when the div count is single digits, it can't be _that_ slow, can it?
[14:53:14] <duch_kazatel> zylophone depends.
[14:53:16] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: let me know when u get a free minute before i pull more hair out :)
[14:53:23] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric depends.
[14:53:32] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric what are the values?
[14:53:49] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel they are values returned from the lastfm api
[14:53:52] <zylophone> Es0teric: yep, I think that's the way I'll go
[14:53:58] <Es0teric> so i dont want to get duplicate songs
[14:54:38] <erming_> Es0teric: so it's an array with strings?
[14:54:41] <erming_> of*
[14:54:49] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric okay.  then this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array
[14:54:51] <Es0teric> erming_ no an array of objects
[14:55:06] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric oh... that's a whole other beast.
[14:55:52] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric because comparing objects is tough.  you should compare the title of each object and remove if they match instead.
[14:56:08] <erming_> i think he's comparing values
[14:56:12] <erming_> maybe $.map is the way to go
[14:56:33] <duch_kazatel> he said it's an array of objects.
[14:56:53] <TViernion> erming_, why are you calling the box url first?
[14:56:58] <erming_> yeah, and he could still iterate that array
[14:57:04] <__joshua__> sometimes doing a JSON.stringify(obj1) === JSON.stringify(obj2);  is the way.  sometimes.
[14:57:15] <erming_> TViernion i'm just using that box for convenience
[14:57:21] <TViernion> oh okay
[14:57:31] <erming_> Es0teric hold on, I'm coding up a JSFiddle from what i think you want
[14:57:45] <Es0teric> erming_ i am using the lastfm api though...
[14:58:10] <duch_kazatel> __joshua__ eeeh, i'd be careful with that one though.
[14:58:29] <TViernion> FRACK!
[14:59:47] <TViernion> http://jsfiddle.net/yL2t6/1/
[14:59:52] <TViernion> here's what i chagned it to erming_
[15:00:23] <duch_kazatel> TViernion that .toString() should be completely unnecessary.
[15:00:51] <TViernion> http://jsfiddle.net/yL2t6/2/
[15:01:17] <duch_kazatel> what is ival() ?
[15:01:17] <TViernion> now im getting an error please use post request
[15:01:31] <TViernion> ival gets the value of a named input variable
[15:01:58] <TViernion> http://jsfiddle.net/yL2t6/3/
[15:01:59] <duch_kazatel> can we see the body of that function?
[15:02:14] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:02:20] <duch_kazatel> return Number(i(name).val());
[15:02:22] <TViernion> http://jsfiddle.net/yL2t6/3/
[15:03:41] <duch_kazatel> do you see the problem here?
[15:04:04] <TViernion> no.. it works
[15:04:18] <duch_kazatel> do you need ival to actually return a number?>
[15:04:29] <TViernion> Duch i honestly use it tons of places
[15:04:32] <TViernion> oh...
[15:04:38] <TViernion> it might not necessairly be a number...
[15:04:54] <TViernion> i do already use it for text and numbers... never had it for ' - or /
[15:05:12] <duch_kazatel> you're trying to return something that cannot be coerced to a number.
[15:05:14] <duch_kazatel> that's your problem.
[15:06:46] <TViernion> okay.. so in this instant.. i need to do something like var blah = $("#id").val();?
[15:07:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah, or remove that Number() call from ival
[15:08:07] <duch_kazatel> if you want to return a number, use parseInt() instead imo.
[15:08:56] <TViernion> var promised_date = $("#promised_date_input").val();  would that get the value of an input with an id of promised_date_input?
[15:09:07] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:09:56] * TViernion kicks self in ass
[15:10:52] <duch_kazatel> voila ;)  it works.
[15:11:42] <erming_> Es0teric still there?
[15:11:44] <TViernion> walah :) it works
[15:11:52] <TViernion> doens't even need the encode
[15:12:18] <Es0teric> erming_ yep
[15:12:37] <erming_> anyway, i found a way to weed out the duplicates, but not sure if it's the cleanest solution out there
[15:12:38] <erming_> http://jsfiddle.net/LUS3D/
[15:12:40] <erming_> it works though
[15:13:08] <erming_> i just iterate all the objects, in this case <div>'s (could really be anything).. and then i put them inside an object with a key and a value
[15:13:23] <erming_> and because keys are unique, you don't get the duplicates
[15:14:06] <erming_> the solution is the part on line 14-20
[15:15:08] <Es0teric> erming_ oh i see now... i wonder how that would work with the lastfm api
[15:16:43] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you ould also use a for() loop to run the comparisons.
[15:16:48] <duch_kazatel> i still say my idea would work.
[15:16:50] <erming_> Es0teric when you say objects, you mean javascript objects or jQuery objects?
[15:17:01] <erming_> let me cook up an even easier example, with just objects.. easy as pie
[15:17:20] <hd1> I have a process that spits out a CSV which I'd like to reformat into an html table
[15:17:51] <hd1> the CSV has epoch time, which I'd like to make into human readable and hyperlinks which I'd like to be clickable
[15:18:14] <duch_kazatel> do you want to convert the epoch time to a normal time?
[15:18:19] <hd1> I can get the display into HTML pretty easily using jquerycsv, but not sure how to do the reformatting
[15:18:30] <duch_kazatel> !mdn date object
[15:18:32] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Date - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[15:18:35] <hd1> duch_kazatel: preferably ISO-8601
[15:19:15] <hd1> to make it easier, the only browsers I care about are Chrome and Firefox
[15:19:38] <Es0teric> erming_ i would assume javascript objects since i am using an api
[15:19:43] <erming_> http://jsfiddle.net/LUS3D/1/
[15:19:45] <erming_> that's one way
[15:19:50] <duch_kazatel> yeah - look at the link had the bot spit out, hd1
[15:19:52] <erming_> i think i can do an even smaller example with $.map
[15:20:36] <duch_kazatel> why not array.map() ?
[15:20:58] <hd1> because $ is shorter than "array" by 4 characters, duch?
[15:21:10] <duch_kazatel> and will be faster :)
[15:22:01] <hd1> duch_kazatel: my question is more how to access the values in the columns of the CSV than how to format them into dates
[15:22:35] <phelix> http://calc.tributemedia.com/ Anyone know what "TypeError: this.canvas.getContext is not a function" this error means?
[15:22:43] <duch_kazatel> hd1 ah.  you could look around for a parser, or build one.  .split() wll be your friend.
[15:24:12] <erming_> Es0teric: this should be enough for you: http://jsfiddle.net/LUS3D/2/
[15:24:53] <erming_> first i turn the array into an object with keys (eliminating duplicates), then i convert it back to an array.. tadaaa
[15:37:05] <hd1> would it be easier to manipulate json, duch?
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> hd1 a bit, but you can split on newlines, and then split each line on ','
[15:37:06] <duch_kazatel> with JSON, you could just access the objects.
[16:07:23] <acidjazz> any1 wanna make $100 ill paypal -> http://iwantdolbyatmos.dolby.com/ get the survey to work in IE9
[16:07:43] <duch_kazatel> lol in the time you've been waiting you probably could have fixed it by now.
[16:07:51] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using on that btwe?
[16:07:55] <duch_kazatel> *btw
[16:08:07] <MrPunkin> can anyone tell me why adding an object tag pointing to an SVG image in my HTML is causing all sorts of jQuery errors?
[16:08:21] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: dood ive been on this bug for hte past 2 days
[16:08:32] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: ive commented out and uncommented every line of code
[16:08:47] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: i got a pissed off client and no ETA even on this thing
[16:09:10] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: i barely ever go on irc for this stuff.. nor do i offer $$$.. but i basically am looking at no more business from dolby if i dont get this fixed
[16:09:18] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: and i have no idea where to even look
[16:09:27] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: 2.x i tried 1.1 latest as well no difference
[16:09:40] <duch_kazatel> 1.1 or 1.11?
[16:09:46] <acidjazz> 1.11 i tried
[16:09:51] <acidjazz> i tried like 10 versions
[16:09:52] <acidjazz> no difference
[16:10:22] <duch_kazatel> because the 2.x series only supports back to IE9.
[16:10:28] <acidjazz> the cash im expensing so.. i have 0 problems giving it out
[16:10:35] <acidjazz> IE9 is my issue
[16:10:39] <acidjazz> i dont allow ie8
[16:10:40] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:10:57] <acidjazz> and after this project im only ie10+
[16:11:24] <duch_kazatel> where was the version with the css fix?
[16:11:48] <acidjazz> http://dolby.256.sh/
[16:12:17] <duch_kazatel> getting a redirect on that, but nvm.
[16:12:29] <acidjazz> http://atmos.256.sh/
[16:12:56] <duch_kazatel> woah did you change the javascript at all since i played with it last?
[16:13:14] <acidjazz> negatory
[16:13:23] <acidjazz> i can dbl check
[16:13:31] <duch_kazatel> $(".sidemenu"); is null
[16:13:39] <duch_kazatel> so i'm getting errors on stuff.
[16:13:40] <acidjazz> nope
[16:13:51] <duch_kazatel> yep
[16:13:57] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/rMeWtr1.png
[16:14:37] <acidjazz> 256?
[16:14:48] <acidjazz> hmm kthx sec
[16:15:46] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/zyqdgb0.png so fix this first.
[16:16:24] <acidjazz> k sorry had some stuff commented out
[16:16:27] <acidjazz> reload
[16:16:51] <duch_kazatel> still broken.
[16:16:56] <duch_kazatel> new errors.
[16:17:12] <acidjazz> hmm workin fin ehere
[16:17:13] <duch_kazatel> actually, same errors, new lines - http://i.imgur.com/jHkVF2t.png
[16:17:23] <acidjazz> object expected has always been there
[16:17:28] <acidjazz> like on the live site
[16:17:36] <duch_kazatel> http://atmos.256.sh/
[16:17:54] <duch_kazatel> wait hold up - you're throwing errors and wondering why shit isn't working right?
[16:18:30] <duch_kazatel> because on every click, i'm getting an error on this line: var sm = $('.sidemenu');
[16:18:31] <acidjazz> so my first question was wtf are these object expecteds coming from
[16:18:43] <acidjazz> huh.. i havent seen that specifically
[16:18:47] <acidjazz> what about the live site?
[16:18:59] <acidjazz> http://iwantdolbyatmos.dolby.com/
[16:19:12] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[16:19:17] <duch_kazatel> no error there.
[16:19:23] <acidjazz> its hte same code
[16:19:23] <acidjazz> the*
[16:19:32] <acidjazz> my git diff shows nothing
[16:20:25] <duch_kazatel> that's really strange.  i manuall cleared cache, too.
[16:20:27] <duch_kazatel> anyway.
[16:20:37] <acidjazz> still on that st = eh?
[16:21:08] <duch_kazatel> the live site is fine for those errors.
[16:21:22] <duch_kazatel> so the first big thing is to add a background color fallback to .filled.
[16:21:37] <duch_kazatel> and then it looks like you're kicking off a css3 animation on submit, yeah?
[16:22:30] <acidjazz> thats on 256
[16:22:45] <acidjazz> i avent gotten to submit.. the 1st bug is the raidos wont fill
[16:22:47] <acidjazz> havent*
[16:22:50] <acidjazz> radios*
[16:22:55] <acidjazz> let me update prod w/ a backup background
[16:23:26] <duch_kazatel> the radios are because IE9 doesn't support the animation
[16:24:08] <acidjazz> yea but they still support background color
[16:24:14] <acidjazz> and im just adding a class
[16:24:41] <duch_kazatel> right, but the classs is firing an animation.
[16:27:40] <acidjazz> ok ill kill the animation
[16:27:59] <duch_kazatel> no need - just use a fallback.
[16:28:25] <acidjazz> the problem is the animation is defining the dimensinos
[16:28:27] <acidjazz> of the element
[16:28:30] <acidjazz> not the element itself
[16:28:48] <acidjazz> the width and height arent specified outside the animatino :)
[16:30:08] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:30:12] <duch_kazatel> so did you give that part?
[16:30:33] <coldhead> chat
[16:30:43] <duch_kazatel> err, *get
[16:30:47] <duch_kazatel> chit
[16:31:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel you see this: http://jsfiddle.net/LUS3D/2/
[16:31:34] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric nope.  sup?
[16:31:53] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i just realized that... the code that dude gave me earlier is hard to apply on this
[16:32:16] <Es0teric> i can pastie my code right now (i am trying to refactor it and remove duplicates)
[16:32:35] <duch_kazatel> this is easy broseph.
[16:32:42] <duch_kazatel> see line 10 in the fiddle?
[16:33:49] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no i mean apply to this http://pastie.org/private/xgetcn7f8it9kvzagpje2q
[16:34:26] <Tomashe> guys can u try hep me out
[16:34:39] <Tomashe> Hey guys i need some advice, i gt that website : http://www.lasso.co.il/%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%91 , below all the small images there is a button that should open a map (google map) i copy paste the iframe from google maps but from some reason it apear bad. as u can see . any suggestions?
[16:34:43] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric again, look at line 10 in the fiddle
[16:34:52] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yeah?
[16:35:03] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that's the part you need to fix.
[16:35:15] <Es0teric> what do you mean duch_kazatel
[16:35:32] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric do you even understand what that fiddle is doing?
[16:37:16] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel adding item in no_duplicates key
[16:37:27] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe inspect it and fix it with CSS>
[16:39:13] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric this is taking each property, getting the contents of the title, then pushing that into the no_duplicates object.   because it's keying off the title, when it adds new data, it basically overwrites the old one.
[16:39:33] <duch_kazatel> and then he converts it to an array,.
[16:40:48] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel but then if it overwrites its still at risk of adding duplicates..
[16:41:20] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: is that css issue?
[16:41:36] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric how?
[16:41:43] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you're keying off the song title.
[16:41:44] <Tomashe> i dont understand how my css effecting the google map
[16:41:58] <duch_kazatel> you can only have a key appear once.
[16:42:15] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe which part of "looks bad" are you taling about?
[16:42:27] <duch_kazatel> you mean the blue bar?  or the map not being centered where you want it?
[16:42:39] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: no
[16:42:50] <Tomashe> duch_kazatel: there is an orange button with text on it below the thumbs
[16:42:57] <Tomashe> click on it and u will see map open in popup
[16:43:01] <duch_kazatel> i saw that.
[16:43:08] <duch_kazatel> i opened it.
[16:43:14] <Tomashe> i use iframe from google.
[16:43:26] <Tomashe> when i put it there its showing bad m as u can see
[16:43:39] <duch_kazatel> which part?  the map not being centered?
[16:43:44] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel how would that work in a for-in loop?
[16:43:46] <Tomashe> when i put it on stip body tag in clear html its working great
[16:43:49] <duch_kazatel> or the blue bar thinger up top?
[16:43:51] <Tomashe> not center, not zoomed
[16:43:53] <Tomashe> and so on..
[16:44:04] <Tomashe> the map not zoomed to the position
[16:44:06] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe go read the documentation on maps then?
[16:44:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel infact, how would that work with my for-in loop?
[16:44:23] <Tomashe> i dont think its about doc
[16:44:32] <Tomashe> i use normal iframe that i took from google map
[16:44:39] <duch_kazatel> Tomashe yoy can't ask for help and then say "no that can't be it"
[16:44:51] <duch_kazatel> it looks like you're using it wrong.
[16:45:05] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you don't...  this does that for you.
[16:46:30] <Tomashe> hmm
[16:48:16] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: derp.. css is on cloudfront.. need to invalidate
[16:59:16] <mayerbci> does anybody have a preference for editors? I hate Dreamweaver for jquery mobile but like code complete options. Using Text Wrangler now because it's not as heavy. Any ideal editors?
[16:59:30] <duch_kazatel> Sublime Text.
[16:59:40] <mayerbci> I'll try it.
[16:59:45] <duch_kazatel> do you just want code autocomplete?
[16:59:48] <mayerbci> thanks
[17:00:40] <mayerbci> I'd like as many options to get my code done fast and clean. building a prototype to test drive jquery mobile. some basic stuff and also a mortgage calculator.
[17:01:00] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:01:24] <duch_kazatel> lots of folks use a combination Sublime Text 2, chrome or firefox's dev tools or firebug, and jsfiddle.
[17:01:34] <mayerbci> anybody want to give it a whirl? mobilebystu.com - just a weeks worth
[17:01:45] <mayerbci> gonna try sublime
[17:02:13] <duch_kazatel> all ready having an issue mayerbci
[17:02:25] <mayerbci> whats that?
[17:02:48] <duch_kazatel> your placeholder for down is "$ or %" - how do I specify which?
[17:03:05] <mayerbci> woa that was fast
[17:03:20] <mayerbci> if it's under 100 it assume percent and over assumes dollars
[17:04:05] <duch_kazatel> you should accept a dollar or percent and go from there imo.
[17:05:21] <mayerbci> i wanted to streamline the steps and reduce necessary widgets - took the concept from some finance apps I developed in my professional life
[17:05:53] <mayerbci> plan on doing a tooltip to provide more detail - plus plan on formatting the field when it loses focus
[17:06:15] <duch_kazatel> generally when you have placeholder text like that, the idea is that I use that somewhere in my input.
[17:06:39] <mayerbci> will consider your ideas and see if there's a way which saves screen space and is a smooth workflow
[17:07:09] <duch_kazatel> by accepting a percent or dollar sign - mixing input acceptance like that is generall not a good idea.
[17:07:13] <duch_kazatel> *generally
[17:08:41] <mayerbci> I always try to find the fastest way to get through entering the data - many ways to skin the cat
[17:09:51] <mayerbci> oh i like sublime - sweet but have to tune those colors before my eyeballs explode
[17:18:16] <mayerbci> sublime works great - goodbye dreamweaver and textwrangler - thanks duch_kazatel
[17:24:59] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: nice work
[17:25:13] <acidjazz> duch_kazatel: check your msgs
[17:26:22] <mayerbci> thnaks - going to build in all the apps I created native now in jquery mobile - why not write once for all possible platforms
[17:27:10] <mayerbci> msgs?
[17:27:44] <acidjazz> i sent him tells
[17:27:56] <acidjazz> mayerbci: what do you mean all possible platforms
[17:28:29] <mayerbci> phones (all OSs), tablets, desktop
[17:28:43] <acidjazz> you want jquery mobile to support desktop
[17:29:51] <mayerbci> no but to develop it's perfect and actually not so bad to use - the app formats actually pretty nice on desktop as well as phone - just extra space on desktop version but I can handle that later
[17:31:35] <mayerbci> it's almost the opposite as before - before people wrote for desktop browsers and it would work well on tanlets and crap on phones - I'm building for phones and get the benefit of tablets and desktops also working - granted some extra space but it works well
[17:38:44] <guide_X> any idea why I wouldn't be able to access the data in this hiddenfield? <input type="hidden" name="ctl00$cntBody$GaugeFilter1$hdfGaugeNameEnabled" id="hdfGaugeNameEnabled" value="True" /> like this ...   gaugeNameEnabled = $("#hdfGaugeNameEnabled").val().toLowerCase();
[17:39:08] <guide_X> I get a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined
[17:40:16] <coldhead> guide_X: does it work in the console?
[17:40:25] <guide_X> no, I get that error in the console
[17:40:39] <guide_X> when I view source, the hiddenfield is there like I pasted
[17:40:45] <guide_X> but jquery seems unable to pick it up
[17:42:02] <guide_X> when I put all of the "input"'s in a variable, and console.log, I do not see my hiddenfields
[17:42:09] <guide_X> it's as if jquery is unable to pick them up
[17:42:21] <guide_X> like this.. var m = $("input"); console.log(m);
[17:45:38] <Velveeta> can you recreate it in a jsfiddle demo?
[17:45:58] <BillCriswell> guide_X: Are you forgetting ()?
[17:46:45] <BillCriswell> Wait... ignore that.
[17:47:52] <guide_X> I will try to make a jsfiddle, but I bet it'll work fine in jsfiddle..
[17:49:24] <guide_X> hmm, when I do this in jsfiddle, I don't have an issue.. http://jsfiddle.net/f5vBx/
[17:49:34] <guide_X> but in my project I do
[17:53:52] <mugger> I have a web page with 10-15 SQL statements which generates a lot of different statisitics/graphs.. is there a simple jquery plugin that will show a loading bar until page is good to go?
[17:54:07] <guide_X> oh wait... hmm moved the js files below the hiddenfields (inside the usercontrol) and it works
[17:54:13] <guide_X> appears to be a .net thing
[17:54:17] <guide_X> thanks anyways!
[17:56:07] <Velveeta> wait... did you have that block wrapped in a document ready wrapper?
[17:56:41] <Velveeta> because if just moving the block down below the hidden fields fixed the issue, it sounds like you didn't...
[17:57:03] <guide_X> Velveeta: I tried inside a doc ready, but it didn't fix the issue
[17:57:14] <guide_X> I also tried moving js to the bottom
[17:57:29] <guide_X> like right abover </body>
[17:58:07] <Velveeta> is it possible that the user control doesn't output as part of the page load, but is injected by some other process afterwards?
[17:58:16] <Velveeta> .net stuff is fucking weird
[17:58:45] <guide_X> I agree, .net is doing something weird..
[17:58:59] <Velveeta> we're still migrating a crapton of asp.net web forms over to mvc razor views, and i always advocate against using the .net element controls in favor of writing out the views in standard markup
[17:59:02] <guide_X> I didn't have a problem until I added a masterpage.. something weird between the usercontrol/masterpage?
[17:59:20] <Velveeta> i'd rather iterate over a model and write out the select options or whatever, than feed them to a dropdownlist control
[17:59:58] <guide_X> Velveeta: this is a legacy project I'm afraid.. closest I can get without re-writting the whole thing is .net 4.0, and ClientIDMode="Static"
[18:00:23] <guide_X> mvc would be ideal, but was hopeing not to start from the beginning with this heh
[18:00:43] <Velveeta> well, that doesn't mean you need to use their element controls.. even under older versions, you can always write out the markup yourself rather than letting it autogenerate that stuff however it does it
[18:01:00] <guide_X> that's true, good ideas, thanks alot
[18:01:25] <Velveeta> i just like to have total control over my markup, and the associated js
[18:01:44] <Velveeta> .net does a whole lot of voodoo-rific crap in that black box it uses to crunch out a page
[18:05:36] <drewery> I know this may not be the channel but I appreciate any input solving my issue here : http://jsbin.com/yilijemo/1/edit  since js channel people are busy discussing something else
[18:06:10] <drewery> I am trying to get the function return a new value without referencing the original variable and changing it all together with the new one
[18:06:26] <drewery> how can I copy the value of a variable into a new one? thanks in advance
[18:08:50] <shoky> drewery: http://jsbin.com/yilijemo/2/edit
[18:10:52] <drewery> shoky: thank you very much for the new trick (I mean for me it is)!
[18:32:04] <oggy729> How can I get the size of an element is json? data.years.styles (cold have many style, 1 style, or none)
[18:44:27] <Velveeta> drewery: http://jsbin.com/yilijemo/5/edit
[18:44:44] <Velveeta> oh damnit, shoky answered like 35 minutes ago :D
[18:44:55] <Velveeta> oggy729: wut..?
[18:46:55] <oggy729> already figured it out...but re-reading my question, it appears to be written in english?
[18:57:44] <zylophone> am i right in assuming that regarding attr vs prop, it's always better to use .attr as it uses prop internally when necessary
[18:58:45] <dumber> Hi guys - i have a dumb question. How do i inject a FULL html source (which i fetched via ajax) into an iframe?
[18:59:03] <Fraz> that is a dumb question
[18:59:25] <zylophone> you're a dumb question!
[19:00:03] <Fraz> so are you!
[19:00:19] <zylophone> nuh-uh
[19:00:28] <Fraz> yuh-uh
[19:00:53] <Velveeta> dumber: i'll see your dumb question and raise you one of my own... why are you fetching iframe content via an ajax call and injecting it, rather than just setting the src of the iframe?
[19:01:16] <Fraz> what that guy said
[19:01:37] <BillCriswell> Dammnit. Thought we had a shut out.
[19:01:39] <Fraz> no he wants to inject it into an iframe
[19:01:50] <Fraz> INTO!
[19:02:18] <Fraz> im wondering why he would want to do that
[19:03:03] <Fraz> inject a webpage into an iframe? this doesnt sound right
[19:03:05] <dumber> Velveeta: basically i have a javascript function that generates a complete page, and i want to display it as iframe (because it cannot share the same css/js as the container)
[19:03:34] <Velveeta> but you said you fetched the full html source via ajax..
[19:03:45] <shoky> zylophone there's no right assumption regarding attr vs prop, you should sometimes use attr and other times use prop ;P  depending on if you want to set an attribute (i.e. .setAttribute on an element) vs setting a property (element.prop = ...)
[19:03:45] <Velveeta> so did you do that, or did your function generate the source?
[19:04:31] <dumber> Velveeta: can come from either sources, the bottom line is that i have a full html source that i need to display inside an iframe - and that said source doesn't really have a page i can src it from
[19:05:23] <Fraz> <dumber> Velveeta: basically i have a javascript function that generates a complete page, and i want to display it as iframe (because it cannot share the same css/js as the container) <<< whaaaat
[19:06:17] <Velveeta> well.. you can *try* grabbing the iframe.contents() and setting the html() to your markup... i don't know if that'll work or not, and if it does, it's a very sloppy method of doing this
[19:07:12] <dumber> Fraz: broken english or it doesn't makes sense?
[19:07:32] <BillCriswell> Fraz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8240101/set-content-of-iframe might be helpful?
[19:07:40] <dumber> Velveeta: let me paste what i'm using, but it seems very sketchy, and causing a ton of sideissues
[19:07:57] <Fraz> BillCriswell?
[19:08:06] <Fraz> i dont wanna do it
[19:08:18] <BillCriswell> dumber: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8240101/set-content-of-iframe
[19:08:21] <Fraz> im just wondering why anyone else would want to
[19:08:27] <BillCriswell> Fraz: I am not the quickest runner in the race.
[19:08:37] <Fraz> lol
[19:08:40] <BillCriswell> Fraz: Yeah, it's an interesting situation to find yourself in.
[19:08:42] <Fraz> well done lil buddy
[19:09:25] <Velveeta> dumber: i don't doubt it's causing a ton of side issues, it seems very prone to breaking
[19:09:32] <Fraz> i mean if the iframe is on your server, then why not just output the content directly
[19:10:21] <dumber> Fraz, because it might not be, it could come or come not come from the server (pretty much version 1 comes from the server, then you can 'edit it' and it comes from the script that generates it)
[19:10:25] <Fraz> why would you EVER need to inject into an iframe is my question
[19:10:33] <dumber> BillCriswell: it's not far from what i'm using
[19:11:11] <Fraz> dumber, basically you want access to an iframe from a remote server with local js?
[19:11:21] <shoky> inject into your server and load a url with the iframe
[19:11:24] <Velveeta> dumber: if you're looking to potentially inject content from sources other than your server, have you given any thought to same origin policy?
[19:11:57] <Fraz> it can be done but the server needs a script on the page thats loaded in the iframe
[19:12:05] <Fraz> to allow you to access it.
[19:12:06] <Velveeta> i would think the better route would be to write a server-side script to fetch the remote content and funnel it back to the client from your local domain
[19:12:20] <Velveeta> and make all requests through your own server
[19:12:35] <Velveeta> in which case, you can just use the src attribute on the iframe and avoid any ajax fetching
[19:13:30] <dumber> Velveeta Fraz Shoky: let me explain a bit better - it's quite a sticky problem i guess. I want to write a serverless script to generate html/edit parts of it based on my needs. The first version of the html comes from a server, the following are generated by a class that takes into account all the changes and spits out an html page
[19:13:31] <Fraz> i looked into this a whil ago, when i was trying to embed webpages into a comparison market type website
[19:13:36] <Fraz> using iframed
[19:13:41] <Fraz> *iframes
[19:14:30] <dumber> this would be so much easier if i could just inject the content spat out into a div and bye - however since the generated page uses bootstrap and mines doesn't (and i don't want to link the css for bootstrap) i can't do it that way, so the only way i can see it working is using an iframe
[19:14:53] <Fraz> why do you need to pull the first version from a server?
[19:15:25] <shoky> what does that matter
[19:16:38] <dumber> Fraz because that's where the page versioning/content is stored. If you like it more let's think of that a separate problem, and let's say that i don't pull it via ajax from the server, but i just generate it locally via js
[19:16:49] <Velveeta> dumber: well.. have you tried using any of the methods yet from the link billcriswell posted?
[19:17:11] <Fraz> its ajax now? not iframe?
[19:17:25] <Fraz> im confused
[19:17:33] <Fraz> <<< been drinking
[19:17:45] <dumber> Fraz: the html comes from either ajax or it's generate by js - i have a full html source code page stored in a variable, and i want to display it
[19:17:53] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.

[19:17:53] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[19:17:53] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling.
[19:17:53] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Where is the problem with the code ?
[19:17:57] <dumber> Velveeta: i have - it's sketchy. If i run some js on it, sometimes the whole body disappears
[19:18:20] <Velveeta> yeah.. i don't know that you're gonna find a trustworthy method of doing this..
[19:18:26] <Velveeta> sharperte: wtf
[19:18:35] <Velveeta> i'm not even gonna read that
[19:18:51] <Fraz> is it even readable?
[19:18:57] <dumber> Sharperte: https://github.com/requirejs/text
[19:19:35] <dumber> Velveeta: any other solutions comes to mind?
[19:19:44] <dumber> meaning, not using the iframe but something else
[19:20:00] <Fraz> you know what i say?
[19:20:02] <Fraz> אישיות בכירה מעולם המשפט עשויה להיחקר על הטרדת זקן
[19:20:05] <Velveeta> dumber: not for what you seem to be trying to do.. keeping the css of the 2 pages physically separated
[19:21:30] <dumber> Velveeta: it's not so much about keeping them separate, the main problem is that the inner stuff (the iframed one) is bootstrapped code, and could contain bits like a fixed top navigator and such, and that would totally break the interface of the 'parent'
[19:21:50] <Velveeta> maybe write a barebones page to load in your iframe, with a js function that looks to the parent document and executes that html-generating-function and takes it and just modifies its own body tag in the local frame?
[19:22:31] <shoky> Sharperte: you didn't include the .newsTicker plugin
[19:24:24] <shoky> Sharperte: you included .easyTicker  though
[19:26:02] <Velveeta> ok, afk for a little while
[19:26:06] <dumber> Velveeta: that might work actually, thanks!
[19:26:09] <Velveeta> probably for the rest of the night tbh
[19:26:30] <Velveeta> dumber: you'd still have to find a reliable way of alerting the iframe that it needs to call that function in the parent document
[19:26:42] <Velveeta> but that might work
[19:26:56] <dumber> (not sure if i'm stretching the concept of webapp/js a bit too far with this one, just trying to prototype a visual page editor in js - i could do it in native, but that's not the point)
[19:27:19] <Sharperte> shoky true if i want to use easyTicker instead newsTicker ? I tried to replace the places with newsTicker with easyTicker but it didnt work. In the <script> tags area.
[19:27:34] <dumber> Velveeta: i can put a js function inside the head of the iframe and call it can't i?
[19:27:40] <shoky> Sharperte: you have to use it correctly, as the instructions say. obviously those 2 are not used in the same way
[19:27:43] <Velveeta> probably
[19:28:15] <Velveeta> and yes, i would say you're stretching the concept of webapp/js a bit too far with that one :D
[19:30:05] <dumber> Velveeta: btw thanks!
[19:30:11] <Velveeta> no problemo, good luck
[19:31:57] <dumber> Velveeta Fraz btw incase it wasn't clear - i was thinking something like dreamweaver, where u have split window for code+preview, the whole point is generating the preview and displaying it (what i've been talking so far) incase it wasn't clear
[19:33:12] <shoky> many sites do that, dumber.. like jsfiddle, jsbin.. they just use a server..
[19:34:07] <dumber> shoky: i appreciate that, but my idea was to package it in a CEF3 therefore i can't rely on a backend
[19:34:14] <dumber> atleast not constantly
[19:35:44] <shoky> well if it's for one specific browser, and it's an extension, i'm sure you can find ways to do it
[19:36:18] <shoky> no idea about CEF tho
[19:36:58] <dumber> Shoky it's not a browser extension, because ideally i would like to ship it as a stand alone - running inside an embedded browser
[19:37:25] <shoky> er yeah i didnt mean extension. app, or whatever it's called
[19:37:51] <shoky> you don't have to use only standard APIs is my point
[19:39:43] <shoky> i'd prolly go for node-webkit for something like that
[19:47:40] <duch_kazatel> a cigar + stone's IRS + code?  yes please.
[19:49:58] <LoneStar99> howdy folks -->  can someone take alook at this and let me know how I can have the arrow only appear on button with mouseover --> http://jsfiddle.net/SB5dk/
[19:50:54] <duch_kazatel> as opposed to what?
[19:51:08] <duch_kazatel> oh all three.
[19:51:36] <duch_kazatel> can you get a better example of your markup?  what's in there is incomplete.
[19:52:18] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel:  yeah all three appear instead on just one on mouseover etc....
[19:52:44] <duch_kazatel> valid markup would be a great first step.
[19:55:15] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: valid markup as in html?
[19:55:27] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[19:56:02] <LoneStar99> oh yeah... "</div>"
[19:56:27] <duch_kazatel> yeah, closing those will help.  otherwise we'll have an invalid fragment which causes all sorts of headaches.
[19:57:15] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: ok done -> http://jsfiddle.net/SB5dk/1/
[19:57:38] <duch_kazatel> that's... not valid...
[19:58:19] <duch_kazatel> are these different divs supposed to be nested?  ooor...?
[19:58:25] <dumber> Uhm... it's not possible to call functions of a children iframe from the parent? if web dev console the function exists but when i call it says undefined?
[19:59:44] <duch_kazatel> dumber how are you trying to call it?
[20:00:00] <dumber> window.nameiframe.funcname();
[20:00:20] <duch_kazatel> that should work.  is the iframe on a different domain?
[20:00:31] <dumber> if i type just window.nameiframe.funcname in the web dev console it outputs the code for that function
[20:00:35] <dumber> no, same domain
[20:01:01] <duch_kazatel> try document.getElementById('iframeID').contentWindow.funcname();
[20:02:04] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel:->  sorry had to restart browsers, f-ckin flash...
[20:02:17] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 that's why i don't use the browser-based client ;)
[20:03:15] <LoneStar99> nice
[20:04:00] <duch_kazatel> did you see my remark about your html?
[20:04:03] <duch_kazatel> it's still not valid.
[20:04:33] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: where u testing for valid html?
[20:04:33] <duch_kazatel> and i'd like to make sure I understand your structure before being all "here's on way".
[20:04:36] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 my eyes... you aren't closing all of your divs.
[20:08:14] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: the UI will look kinda like ->  http://t.co/aiA56VKJq8  so when user cursor is on "FreeBSD"  arrow will fadeIn and same goes for AWS Linux etc....
[20:08:30] <duch_kazatel> LoneStar99 great?  so fix your html...
[20:11:39] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: ok working on a fix
[20:12:12] <duch_kazatel> is each button supposed to be separate?
[20:12:19] <duch_kazatel> like, they're not nested?
[20:13:58] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: ok got it working -> http://jsfiddle.net/SB5dk/2/
[20:14:09] <LoneStar99> let me know if it can be coded better...
[20:14:20] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[20:14:28] <duch_kazatel> much
[20:15:20] <the_last> hi guys, i'm trying to have a function do something when someone types into a textarea, but $('#x').change isn't doing that, it only triggers when they click out of the text area. what am i supposed to be using?
[20:15:42] <duch_kazatel> mousedown
[20:16:01] <the_last> ?
[20:16:13] <duch_kazatel> err, wait sorry out of it.
[20:16:18] <the_last> lol
[20:16:20] <the_last> keydown?
[20:16:27] <duch_kazatel> yeah that's it
[20:16:30] <duch_kazatel> .on('keydown'
[20:16:35] <the_last> sweet, thank you
[20:16:37] <duch_kazatel> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html
[20:16:38] <duch_kazatel> for more info.
[20:18:30] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel: thanks for your help =)
[20:19:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/SB5dk/4/
[20:20:28] <LoneStar99> duch_kazatel:  ok great =)  now will test on real UI and see how is working out...
[21:41:14] <feathersanddown> if I have <form action="index.php" name="frm_myform" id="frm_myform" method="post" >       how to select it correctly? $('form[name=frm_myform]')  or $('#frm_myform')    think about inputs inside form too
[21:41:59] <feathersanddown> was an example, there is a prefered way to select?
[21:44:26] <feathersanddown> just asking about a standard or best practice or performance reason
[21:54:57] <jphase> feathersanddown: if you have an id then use that id
[22:02:10] <supsup> sup
[22:06:49] <jphase> sup supsup hehe
[22:06:54] <feathersanddown> but in a form there is no need to  have an id in every input element, even if it have an id, is useful to use sharp, but that sintax is the only way?
[22:08:20] <feathersanddown> for me, the 'form[name=input1]' is a nice syntaxis, with or without id, it clearly do a reference to a form element
[22:09:02] <jphase> well firstly, your form wouldn't have a name attribute
[22:09:02] <jphase> but if you want to target by name instead of id that's fine too
[22:09:33] <jphase> $('#myformid input[name="something"]')  is totally fine
[22:09:44] <feathersanddown> oh yes, it was an example
[22:10:11] <feathersanddown> so there is no standard, performance or best practice reason to use one or another
[22:10:34] <feathersanddown> ???
[22:10:39] <jphase> well there are standards when selecting attributes
[22:10:56] <jphase> for example... $('[name="foobar"]') is slower than $('input[name="foobar"]')
[22:11:07] <jphase> because it loops through less elements
[22:11:08] <jphase> to "check" for a name attribute
[22:11:28] <jphase> so be specific if you're using attribute selectors if possible
[22:11:49] <jphase> so anything matching > 1 element (i.e. a classname, attribute, etc.) it's a good idea to put the tag name in front of it
[22:12:25] <coldhead> fewer*
[22:12:46] <feathersanddown> for performance reason is best #sintaxis??
[22:13:12] <feathersanddown> but imho form is less readeable
[22:13:29] <feathersanddown> to put #sintaxis in every input
[22:14:33] * jphase invites coldhead to help in #grammar lol
[22:14:55] <feathersanddown> grammar channel? joining......
[22:15:05] <feathersanddown> ooohh nobody :(
[22:15:25] <feathersanddown> but could be useful for non-english users like me
[22:16:27] <jphase> feathersanddown: you don't need to put ids on each input, no. ids are really just meant for targeting elements more finitely. if you have multiple forms on the page, for example, then you could potentially have 12 inputs with the same name... depends on your use of markup
[22:18:37] <feathersanddown> well, exactly what I say, this is my question about selector sintaxis
[22:19:12] <feathersanddown> nothing standard                                     ..... ?
[22:22:36] <jphase> depends on what you consider a standard really hehe. if you're going for speed then specified ids for each element is most likely your quickest route. i personally put an id on my form and select inputs by name after that most often.
[22:23:34] <feathersanddown> yes I see often that way, is very useful
[22:23:44] <feathersanddown> ah ok, just know
[22:23:46] <feathersanddown> :)
[22:23:51] <feathersanddown> thanks for your time :) :)
[22:23:58] <jphase> sure
[22:26:25] <supsup> exit
[22:30:26] <rahuldroy> Hi Guys, I was just wonder if someone could help me create a similar text scrolling effect (top right) as the one on http://limestoneperth.com.au/
[22:39:58] <coldhead> thanks ChanServ
[22:50:21] <coldhead_nhulea>  howdy !
[22:50:31] <brunoais> g'mornin'
[22:51:02] <coldhead_nhulea> dude its 1050 pm?
[22:51:51] <coldhead_nhulea> rahuldroy: http://jschr.github.io/textillate/
[22:52:34] <coldhead_nhulea> you could also just wget the page and reverse engineer the code to your liking
[22:54:11] <rahuldroy> coldhead_nhulea: OMG THANK YOU!!!!
[22:54:21] <rahuldroy> coldhead_nhulea: How did you find that???
[22:54:31] <coldhead_nhulea> I have used before
[22:54:44] <coldhead_nhulea> but I think this would work
[22:54:55] <coldhead_nhulea> !g text animation javascript

[23:21:39] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[23:21:43] <Starcraftmazter> im havving issues with draggable
[23:22:17] <Starcraftmazter> i wish to use a helper to move my element around, because theres a layer of elements above the element which needs to be moved, but the trigger for its movement should go above them
[23:22:31] <Starcraftmazter> but the helper is causing the helper element to get destroyed after i use it
[23:27:02] <jay__> hi.. need help in jquery ajax
[23:27:36] <grizly> jay__: simply post your problem, if someone is able to help, and is online, they will likely help
[23:27:40] <jay__> ajax response showing same message twice
[23:28:28] <grizly> jay__: have you got a fiddle with the code?
[23:29:52] <jay__> actually im using mysql also..so running it locally
[23:31:49] <Cork> jay__: client side doesn't care about what you have as your backend
[23:32:03] <jay__> ok cork
[23:32:10] <Cork> jay__: just make sure what is in the response body is what it should be
[23:40:08] <oggy729> Is there a way to detect when the user has selected something from a <select>? I am building a <select> dynamically based on some other form fields...the problem I am having is that each time I rebuild the list, the change() event fires....I only want to know when the user actually clicked it....not when it was dynamically recreated.
[23:41:08] <Cork> oggy729: changing the value in code shouldn't fire the event
[23:42:51] <Cork> oggy729: http://jsfiddle.net/z4z7g/
[23:45:24] <oggy729> Err, I misspoke. It's late. Ok, when the page loads, the <select> is actually a <text> field. I'm populating this field based on an API call. If only *one* result is returned for that field, the results are generally flaky; they cannot be relied upon. So I have to keep it as a text field so the user can alter the value if needed.
[23:46:30] <oggy729> However, if many results for that field are returned from the API, I can generally rely on one of them being correct. So I use replaceWith() to make the <text> a <select>
[23:46:34] <b-ot> oggy729: No output.
[23:47:15] <oggy729> ...and then change fires.
[23:47:48] <oggy729> b-ot: No output?
[23:47:48] <b-ot> oggy729: yes — definitely.
[23:47:49] <Cork> oggy729: then you have some code somewhere triggering a .change() or .trigger('change')
[23:47:58] <Cork> oggy729: it's just a bot
[23:48:30] <Cork> oggy729: the native change event only fires when the user interacts with it
[23:48:35] <Cork> same for text fields
[23:48:43] <oggy729> Cork: Nope, no change anywhere...$('#id_trim').replaceWith(trims_drop);
[23:49:02] <oggy729> trims_drop = '<select id="id_trim" name="id_trim">' etc etc etc
[23:49:02] <Cork> oggy729: can you reproduce the effect in a fiddle?
[23:49:51] <oggy729> Cork: That would be a lot of work. lol. I don't think the API would even accept a call from there.
[23:50:06] <Cork> oggy729: not if replaceWith is the cause you talk about
[23:50:27] <Cork> oggy729: basically, i highly doubt it is the cause
[23:50:35] <Cork> so you need to track down what causes it
[23:50:36] <oggy729> Cork: Oh....yeah I suppose I could just factor that out
[23:57:49] <the_last> hmm, i've got a layout like this: <div><div class="x">test</div><div class="y">test</div>
[23:57:50] <the_last> how would I go about selecting "y" from within $(this) if $(this) is the "x" div? for example:
[23:57:50] <the_last> $(this).parent().child(".y") <- but that's not valid
[23:59:07] <the_last> ah its children not child ;)
[23:59:09] <the_last> got it
