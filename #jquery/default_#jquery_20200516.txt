[00:08:01] <sydbarret> the design
[00:14:13] <JohnDoe2> what design? :P
[00:16:23] <sydbarret> just the divs
[00:16:54] <sydbarret> so basically everything when i right click and hit inspect
[00:17:01] <sydbarret> is what I need?
[00:18:16] <JohnDoe2> websites are made of HTML code, styled by CSS code, and animated/acted on via javascript
[00:18:31] <JohnDoe2> the combination of those, in a specific order, makes what you see when you browse that site
[00:19:01] <JohnDoe2> so copying the DIVs would get you just that - a bunch of DIVs. If you have no css guiding their arrangement ... it doesn't look the same
[00:23:47] <sydbarret> what is this
[00:23:53] <sydbarret> builder-assets.unbounce.com/published-js/main.bundle-81f56cf.z.js
[00:24:08] <sydbarret> is that like a cdn script library i can use?
[00:24:15] <sydbarret> is that like bootstrap?

[21:54:42] <sydbarret> hi
[21:55:05] <sydbarret> any script where i can push a button and it will replace and image?
[22:08:46] <Feldmaus> "replace and image"?
[22:19:57] <sydbarret> Feldmaus im on index.html which is inside templates folder
[22:20:13] <sydbarret> at the same level of templates folder there is static
[22:20:25] <sydbarret> and inside of it a css folder
[22:20:48] <sydbarret> it seems i have a problem finding my main.css
[22:20:49] <sydbarret>     <link href="//static/css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text/css">
[22:20:54] <sydbarret> is that path ok?
[22:23:24] <Feldmaus> "/static/..." I guess, but it depends on the server
[22:23:45] <sydbarret> so no // ?
[22:24:03] <sydbarret> its a flask server
[22:24:29] <Feldmaus> I don't know about flask. What happens when you try?
[22:24:41] <sydbarret> net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
[22:24:58] <sydbarret> when i load the page i got GET http://static/css/main.css net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
[22:25:34] <Feldmaus> Well, no double slash
[22:26:48] <sydbarret> it works yes
[22:27:06] <sydbarret> now i have a piece of code that is suppose to change and img source
[22:27:12] <sydbarret> after i hit a button
[22:28:00] <sydbarret> let me show you
[22:28:21] <Feldmaus> $("my_img").attr("src", "new_src") should work
[22:28:41] <Feldmaus> And you need to install a button handler for "click"
[22:29:12] <Feldmaus> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[22:29:21] <sydbarret> https://bpa.st/WQ4Q
[22:30:51] <Feldmaus> Looks okay
[22:31:12] <Feldmaus> At least when your table ID is "table"
[22:32:02] <sydbarret> my table is defined as
[22:32:03] <sydbarret>   <table class="table table-bordered table-responsive text-center table-dark table-sm">
[22:32:10] <sydbarret> you mean i need to add it an id?
[22:33:13] <Feldmaus> Or change your selector. "#table" is looking for an element with id="table"
[22:33:31] <Feldmaus> Is that your only table?
[22:40:20] <sydbarret> it kind of work
[22:40:26] <sydbarret> but it doesnt show the .png
[22:40:33] <sydbarret> its shows as an small icon
[22:41:47] <sydbarret> original is this https://bpa.st/NA2A
[22:43:18] <sydbarret> Feldmaus so it shows as this when i click the button https://pasteboard.co/J8J3yKq.png
[22:53:30] <Feldmaus> sydbarret: Looks like the image URL is wrong
[22:55:34] <sydbarret> no the image is right
[22:55:43] <sydbarret> that is an initial url image
[22:56:38] <sydbarret> im replacing it with a local .png file
[22:56:57] <sydbarret> the url is the cloud one which is not mine
[22:57:28] <Feldmaus> The new URL is wrong, that's indicated by that little broken image symbol
[22:58:30] <sydbarret> oh so the path is wrong?
[22:58:36] <sydbarret> but im using the same path as the link
[22:58:55] <sydbarret> $("img").attr("src", "/static/css/logo2.png");
[22:59:19] <sydbarret> oh shees you are right
[22:59:25] <sydbarret> thats the wrong folder sorry
