[00:15:05] <royalty> hello
[00:15:11] <royalty> i know this is vaguely related to jquery
[00:15:23] <royalty> but basically i am trying to get scrollspy to work
[00:15:27] <royalty> bootstrap scrollspy
[00:15:35] <royalty> and it is a jquery plug in
[00:15:52] <royalty> i checked the mark up over and over and think it should be working, i opted to initialize it in js
[00:16:10] <royalty> i suppose i should just make a watered down sample
[00:16:16] <royalty> I'll do that
[00:16:29] <royalty> where is a cool place to make a sample?
[00:26:44] <royalty> ok
[00:26:45] <royalty> http://codepen.io/modicrumb/pen/yaZVGj
[00:26:56] <royalty> can anyone tell me why scrollspy is not working?
[00:28:09] <royalty> oh nvm
[00:28:15] <royalty> i have to include jquery on codepen
[00:32:08] <royalty> it's working in the sample
[00:32:14] <royalty> so have to figure out what it is in my env
[00:35:16] <royalty> ok so i think i know
[00:35:27] <royalty> i have two scrollspy events attached to body
[00:35:31] <royalty> how do i remove one?
[00:43:49] <royalty> this is my problem http://codepen.io/modicrumb/pen/yaZVGj
[00:48:24] <royalty> i think i got it :)
[00:49:38] <royalty> yessss
[00:49:42] <royalty> awesome
[00:49:44] <royalty> thanks guys lolll
[04:40:05] <earational> hey
[05:08:51] <Blinky_> Hi all, I am trying to combine 3 ajax requests to use the same done and failed functions.  This is what I have so far but it is not working, the first two functions are not being found - http://pastebin.com/NQNiYADP
[05:11:39] <Blinky_> Nevermind think I have solved it :0
[05:17:59] <Cork> Blinky_: eh, you're creating local variables in each function
[05:18:45] <Cork> Blinky_: if you plan to make multiple ajax call, what you should do is use $.when().done()
[05:19:03] <Cork> but i can't tell if that is what you're trying to do as there is no call code for the functions
[05:19:47] <Blinky_> Sorry bad explaination, I am not calling all at once.  I am wanting to use the done and fail for each of the functions of which those functions will only be called one at a time
[05:20:25] <Blinky_> I ended up with this - http://pastebin.com/mJH4zCY7
[05:20:49] <Blinky_> I did not want a done and fail for each ajax function
[05:22:02] <Cork> Blinky_: your indentation is broken
[05:23:06] <Cork> Blinky_: why not just have the functions send in the type to the process function
[05:23:14] <Cork> and dedupe all the rest of that code
[05:23:18] <Cork> as it is all shared anyway
[05:23:39] <Cork> process(elm, 'completed')
[05:23:50] <Blinky_> That is waht I am trying to do, this code was 3 times the size before I started.
[05:26:06] <Cork> Blinky_: https://jsfiddle.net/4s62aje3/
[05:26:21] <Cork> i would prob just drop the first three functions
[05:26:31] <Cork> ans call process directly from the source origin
[05:26:42] <Cork> opps missed one line
[05:26:49] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/4s62aje3/1/
[05:44:36] <Blinky_> Cork, Sorry mate got called away, thats is a lot cleaner, also like the fact you are placing the elem.html() straight into the data instead of storing it first.  thanks a lot, learnt something new again.
[07:44:26] <Pablo_> Hi
[07:44:44] <Pablo_> I'm trying to populate an array using $.each
[07:44:54] <Pablo_> But it doesn't seem to work
[07:44:59] <Pablo_> Here is the code: https://jsfiddle.net/gbosy5f8/
[07:45:37] <Pablo_> If I try to execute the 'addSource' function multiple time, it works. If I try to execute it as is in the code, it doesn't seem to work
[07:45:51] <Pablo_> It returns "Cannot read property 'sources' of undefined"
[07:46:53] <Pablo_> https://jsfiddle.net/ayzgocyt/ <-- This is when using 'addSource' multiple times. It works.
[07:46:56] <Pablo_> THanks a lot.
[07:55:55] <Pablo_> Nothing, I solved it. Thanks
[08:07:37] <Cork> Pablo_: getJSON is async, also you can juse use $.map
[08:39:47] <Duikb00t> hola
[08:39:59] <Duikb00t> i've got a question, im using Inview ( jQuery plugin )
[08:40:17] <Duikb00t> It is a bad practice to define every image in my app in my .js and check the inview status in my script?
[08:40:33] <Duikb00t> Actually I want to load as many as possible images by lazyloading
[09:38:37] <prepender> Does anyone have experience with recaptcha? In IE11 I keep getting an error "Invalid calling object" after I check the box. So frustratingggg
[10:16:57] <vinxz> Hi all guys! I have a page.html on my site with the following HTML: http://pastebin.com/7TWBL6ES . I can’t manipulate Js because same-orign policy. Any people know how to do it?
[10:19:22] <taplar> afaik you'd have to create a proxy to the site
[10:23:29] <Cork> vinxz: either you have to allow the cross domain request through cors
[10:23:37] <Cork> vinxz: or you have to use postMessage
[10:23:56] <Cork> both require you to modify the site inside the iframe
[10:25:25] <taplar> hmm, for some reason i thought resource access and allowing js access were different security mechanisms.  interesting
[10:26:54] <Cork> i would prob use postMessage my self
[10:27:19] <Cork> no reason to punch a crater to let a mosquito through
[10:27:57] <decx> well, you'll be able to scale to a lot of mosquitos tho ;)
[10:28:07] <Cork> heh
[10:47:59] <vinxz> Cork: can I use postMessage if I don't have access on iframmed server?
[10:50:43] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage
[11:17:05] <vinxz> taplar: I need to insert window.addEventListener inside the iframe, but I can't.
[11:18:46] <taplar> right, the owner of that site has to
[11:22:49] <vinxz> taplar: If the owner doesn't wont to add this call, there is a way for doing it?
[11:23:33] <taplar> not through js
[11:58:23] <simmerz> I’ve noticed that if I have a selected value in a <select>, and then change the <option>s within it, then $(<select>).val() retains the id of the old <option> which is no longer there. Any ideas?
[11:58:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:59:28] <taplar> val() should relate to the value="" on an option
[11:59:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ the current active option
[11:59:55] <simmerz> let me see if I can replicate quickly in a jsfiddle
[12:00:15] <taplar> are you saying your changing an option value and it is not being reflected by the select value?
[12:00:42] <taplar> cause 'id' doesn't make sense in your statement
[12:00:58] <simmerz> taplar, I mean the value sorry
[12:01:04] <Gloomy> Hi :)
[12:01:10] <Gloomy> Why does "jQuery.parseHTML(menuTemplates[name]).find("button").css(display,none);" return an error?
[12:01:25] <robertmaxrees> what's the error Gloomy?
[12:01:25] <Gloomy> (it says "button is not a function")
[12:01:49] <simmerz> taplar, I’m saying I’m changing the list of <option>’s in the <select>, but the value of the select even with no <option>s within it is still the previously selected option
[12:01:57] <Gloomy> I'm guessing that parseHTML doesn't return  jquery object?
[12:02:00] <robertmaxrees> fwiw parseHTML returns an array and not a jquery object Gloomy
[12:02:17] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsehtml/ ;)
[12:02:41] <Gloomy> robertmaxrees : Yea, I think that's the problem, but how do I turn it in a jquery object without appending it to the dom yet ?
[12:03:15] <Gloomy> (I'm quite new so maybe I'm missing something in that page you linked)
[12:03:20] <taplar> simmerz: then you may have to do something to make it re-eval the value
[12:03:22] <robertmaxrees> $($.parseHTML(menuTemplates[name])) is one way.
[12:03:28] <simmerz> taplar: such as?
[12:03:39] <taplar> select the option you want the value to be
[12:03:44] <taplar> or set the value to the new value
[12:04:10] <Gloomy> robertmaxrees I'll try thanks
[12:04:27] <simmerz> taplar: there are no options. I want to disable another field off the back of there being no options
[12:04:37] <taplar> it's a select with no options?
[12:04:53] <simmerz> taplar: for now. until another select has a selected option
[12:05:06] <taplar> stick a blank option in there and set the value to ""
[12:05:20] <taplar> or just disable the element
[12:05:30] <taplar> disabled elements should not be sent to the backend upon submit
[12:05:47] <simmerz> taplar this is long before submit. let me show you a jsfiddle when I’ve made it
[12:06:05] <taplar> k
[12:09:17] <madprops> why does jquery's animation always animate from bottom to top and can't seem to do it from top to bottom/
[12:09:18] <madprops> ?
[12:09:36] <madprops> i just specify a bigger top in animate than the current top
[12:09:40] <madprops> and it animates from bottom
[12:12:36] <robertmaxrees> madprops show pls
[12:13:42] <madprops> robertmaxrees, right now it doesn't even appear on screen ... it gets a ridiculous big top for some reason http://gsick.com/paste/139/
[12:14:05] <robertmaxrees> madprops wut.  what's the problem you're trying to solve?
[12:14:26] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9hjswc1j/
[12:15:12] <Yepp> how do I return something from $.each() i mean something like .append( function with $.each that return html ) ?
[12:15:19] <madprops> robertmaxrees, why does it work in there?
[12:15:24] <robertmaxrees> Yepp you can't.
[12:15:31] <taplar> Yepp: use map
[12:15:31] <robertmaxrees> madprops sounds like you have some bad CSS doing on.
[12:15:34] <Yepp> meh, to bad
[12:15:35] <madprops> i want to make it appear in the middle of the screen, coming from the top
[12:15:37] <Yepp> tooo*
[12:15:42] <Yepp> map? hm
[12:15:48] <Yepp> lemme try
[12:15:55] <robertmaxrees> Yepp check out the native js map.
[12:16:05] <Yepp> yea i know map, but that returns an array
[12:16:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:16:16] <Yepp> append accepts array?
[12:16:16] <Yepp> nice
[12:16:19] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:16:20] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:16:27] <Yepp> what? join it?
[12:16:27] <robertmaxrees> then you do theNewArray.join('');
[12:16:47] <Yepp> yep, was right. thanks
[12:17:09] <taplar> iirc, append will accept an array
[12:17:09] <robertmaxrees> oh weird append will take an array.
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> htmlstring, element, text, array or jquery object.
[12:17:20] <robertmaxrees> noice
[12:17:21] <taplar> puts them all in a doc fragment
[12:17:26] <Yepp> so no more join?
[12:17:31] <robertmaxrees> apparently not.
[12:18:49] <Yepp> yep, it works as expected
[12:20:37] <Yepp> if i do $('<element />').inserAfter().append, append still reference to the element right?
[12:21:08] <taplar> if you have to ask, it's slightly confusing and could be written better, ;)
[12:21:11] <taplar> but yes
[12:21:47] <Yepp> oh sorry, i thought you'll figure it out quickly
[12:21:57] <robertmaxrees> you could also check the docs :)
[12:22:18] <taplar> extended chaining vs readability, was my point
[12:24:05] <taplar> though if your creating elements a lot you might look into a templating library
[12:29:31] <simmerz> taplar: must be something in my code. the jsfiddle appears to be working
[12:31:02] <Yepp> so I did $('new element').after('another element next to it') but the element inside .after() isn't created
[12:31:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:32:11] <Yepp> the element i'm trying to create inside .after() isn't created
[12:32:33] <Yepp> $('<div />').after('<span />'). span is not created
[12:32:44] <robertmaxrees> ... where are you expecting it to appear?
[12:32:56] <Yepp> just right after the new div
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> ... where's the new div?
[12:33:09] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/after/
[12:33:11] <robertmaxrees> you're not appending any of that to the page.,
[12:33:33] <Yepp> div is created, i put it in an element
[12:33:47] <robertmaxrees> hey so could you make a fiddle showing what you're actually trrying to do?
[12:34:36] <Yepp> sure
[12:38:49] <Yepp> http://jsbin.com/hasajibomi/edit?html,js,output
[12:39:52] <Yepp> would like to add <ul> after <strong> then add <li> using map
[12:40:29] <robertmaxrees> return types.
[12:40:42] <robertmaxrees> .after() is probably returning the original element.
[12:40:53] <robertmaxrees> it would only return one or the other.
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> not both elements.
[12:41:36] <decx> i know even less now
[12:41:52] <robertmaxrees> think of it this way: return $('<strong>Some title</strong>').after('<span>Span</span>');
[12:41:57] <robertmaxrees> what would that return?
[12:42:12] <taplar> ah, i get it
[12:42:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:42:16] <taplar> lol
[12:42:27] <robertmaxrees> it's not going to return both elements, it's going to return one or the other.
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> this is why Yepp really just wants a templating engine.
[12:42:47] <Yepp> just for a single thing i need?
[12:42:49] <Yepp> meh
[12:43:04] <Yepp> I'll add it if I'd do it on most of the pages
[12:43:14] <decx> after on an element that's not in the dom does nothing
[12:43:14] <taplar> why even use after though?
[12:43:27] <taplar> why not just stick it all in that string?
[12:43:35] <Yepp> yea, was about to say that
[12:43:36] <Yepp> but
[12:43:45] <taplar> you wouldn't even have to wrap it in $() then
[12:43:48] <Yepp> i'll still do .each or map in the middle of the string
[12:44:14] <Yepp> errr wait..
[12:46:58] <Yepp> http://jsbin.com/hasajibomi/edit?js,console,output
[12:47:00] <Yepp> :D
[12:47:12] <z1haze_work> what callback always runs in an ajax call?
[12:47:17] <robertmaxrees> .always()
[12:47:17] <Yepp> complete
[12:47:25] <z1haze_work> not done?
[12:47:36] <robertmaxrees> .done() only runs if it was resolved successfully.
[12:47:44] <Yepp> notDone()lol
[12:47:45] <z1haze_work> gotcha
[12:47:52] <z1haze_work> thank you
[12:47:53] <robertmaxrees> .complete() is deprecated fwiw.
[12:47:59] <z1haze_work> use always()?
[12:48:02] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:48:06] <z1haze_work> thank you
[12:48:06] <Yepp> talking about complete:
[12:48:10] <Yepp> not .complete()
[12:48:13] <robertmaxrees> or .then() and pass two args.
[12:48:15] <z1haze_work> is that available is 1.11?
[12:48:21] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:48:23] <z1haze_work> cool
[12:50:44] <z1haze_work> so like with beforeSend: progress.show, can i call always the same way?
[12:50:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:50:57] <z1haze_work> always: progress.hide, ?
[12:51:02] <robertmaxrees> use the method.
[12:51:04] <z1haze_work> when building the ajax object
[12:51:06] <robertmaxrees> .always()
[12:51:46] <z1haze_work> right, but this is what ive come into, ive modified it somewhat http://dpaste.com/3PEVW0K
[12:52:05] <z1haze_work> there is a beforeSend: that triggers
[12:52:13] <z1haze_work> is there nothing i can put up top like that for when its finished?
[12:52:53] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do it that way personally.
[12:53:00] <beasty> evening !
[12:53:10] <z1haze_work> how would you do the call differently?
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work let me show you.
[12:55:23] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/eb30d66a331b something like this.
[13:01:28] <z1haze_work> ok well i refactored, now really how you put it, but for whatever reason the progress show isnt even happening now
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> this channel.
[13:01:43] <z1haze_work> and when i try to step inside the ajax call in dev tools it jumps over into the minified jquery file..
[13:01:52] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase that's where it'd go.
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> good luck man.
[13:02:03] <z1haze_work> man..
[13:02:27] <z1haze_work> because someone doesnt exactly use the code you show in an example they must suck huh
[13:03:13] <Yepp> having used react before, I adapted the flux pattern. Would like to do it in jQ when jQ is enough for the app, is it possible to watch an object change?
[13:03:24] <Yepp> obviously that is for watching "state"
[13:09:15] <decx> there's no subscribe or anything like that, but i guess if you really wanted you could use redux with jquery
[13:12:11] <Yepp> yea, what I currently do is just either always call a method right after say "set state" equivalent
[13:12:34] <Yepp> or ... that only
[13:12:35] <Yepp> xD
[13:18:24] <aro> how do i select form fields from a form that have a value?
[13:18:39] <aro> i tried something like this                     var $field = $form.find('input[name="'+ obj.name +'"]').has(':value');
[13:18:42] <aro> but that didnt want to work
[13:18:53] <decx> all formfield are iterable from the form element
[13:19:05] <aro> i am trying to get the $field elements from the $form element
[13:19:09] <aro> but i cant figure out how
[13:19:43] <roflmyeggo> is there a way to prevent a change() event from firing on a val() change?
[13:19:52] <aro> the $form element includes all of the fields that were not included in the submit
[13:19:57] <aro> I dont want those
[13:20:11] <taplar> val(newValue) doesn't trigger a change event
[13:20:12] <decx> change doesnt fire when you change val() programmatically
[13:20:30] <roflmyeggo> taplar: it doesnt in Chrome/FF/etc. but IE11 seems to trigger it for me
[13:21:10] <aro> so is there a way to get the $field jquery objects that were submitted with a form submit?
[13:21:19] <roflmyeggo> taplar: its odd because its exactly as you say in the documentation
[13:21:23] <roflmyeggo> "Note: Changing the value of an input element using JavaScript, using .val() for example, won't fire the event."
[13:21:45] <taplar> its only in ie11?
[13:21:52] <roflmyeggo> taplar: yeah :/
[13:21:58] <decx> as per spec change involves focus, input, a change of the value and blur
[13:22:35] <roflmyeggo> decx: why does it say val() wont trigger change() on the doc page for change()?
[13:22:53] <decx> because it doesnt
[13:23:01] <decx> havent seen it on ie11 either
[13:23:10] <taplar> events are for user interactions
[13:23:12] <roflmyeggo> decx: hmm okay thanks ill look into it more
[13:23:17] <taplar> val() is not one
[13:24:43] <aro> how do i get submitted form field objects?
[13:26:31] <decx> it always submits every one of its elements
[13:26:40] <Gloomy> Hey :) Can I remove an event listener that was hardcoded in the html with jquery ?
[13:26:55] <Gloomy> something.off() doesn't seem to be working
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> Gloomy using, say, onclick?
[13:27:11] <taplar> you mean its on the html tag?
[13:27:12] <decx> is it a jquery on?
[13:27:15] <Yepp> removeProp('onClick') maybe?
[13:27:24] <roflmyeggo> decx taplar: i removed the .val() change and the event is not fired in IE11 from change()
[13:27:35] <roflmyeggo> when i add the val() change, the event is fired
[13:27:36] <Gloomy> (by hardcoded I mean it's a <button ... onclick="...">
[13:27:39] <aro> roflmyeggo: then you have something else doing it
[13:27:46] <aro> i just tested in ie11/10/9
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> Gloomy you can;'t use jquery to remove those.
[13:27:49] <aro> and they all dont trigger it
[13:27:51] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to remove the property.
[13:28:06] <roflmyeggo> aro: ok, thanks :D
[13:28:18] <Gloomy> robertmaxrees Ok, thanks. so what Yepp says ?
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> Gloomy sure - do you control the place you're getting the html from?
[13:29:34] <Gloomy> Hmm, yes, I'm just being lazy :-) When I get the whole thing to work I'll improve that, I know it's bad to hardcode these
[13:29:34] <z1haze_work> does done() fire before or after success() with ajax?
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> the doics will tell you z1haze_work :)
[13:29:54] <robertmaxrees> Gloomy erm, why not save the time and effort now?
[13:30:00] <decx> roflmyeggo: yep just tested in ie11 as well and it's not firing change
[13:30:10] <aro> there must be a way to get the field objects
[13:30:13] <roflmyeggo> decx: thanks, appreciate it
[13:30:27] <roflmyeggo> im obviously missing something so i'll dig in further
[13:30:34] <decx> the form element has an elements property holding a htmlcollection aro
[13:30:54] <Gloomy> robertmaxrees Yessir. I had a reason to do it that way but it's not there anymore. Will do :)
[13:31:08] <robertmaxrees> work smarter ;)
[13:31:09] <Yepp> i have a max-height transition set, but it seems not to be animating
[13:31:40] <Yepp> .slide = max-height 0 and transition: max-height xs and .slide.down = max-height 999px
[13:31:52] <Yepp> when adding .down class it justs pops down
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> why not use css transitions?
[13:32:22] <Yepp> what? that's a css transition already isn't?
[13:32:34] <robertmaxrees> ah you're not using jquery for that?
[13:32:42] <Yepp> using jquery to add the class
[13:32:49] <robertmaxrees> check out #css for help on the transition.
[13:32:51] <decx> well you need height
[13:32:57] <decx> max-height alone doesnt do anything
[13:33:27] * Yepp scratches head
[13:33:34] <Yepp> why?
[13:33:54] <decx> this thing i have is 0 px high, i want to have max-height 999... element goes "ok i'll stay at 0 then"
[13:34:16] <Yepp> https://codepen.io/LFeh/pen/ICkwe doesn't have height set tho
[13:34:20] <taplar> 0 was max-height
[13:34:31] <Yepp> yea, max-height was on 0
[13:34:36] <Yepp> and now it'll be 999px
[13:35:09] <decx> well that does have height due to its content
[13:35:20] <decx> it's just cut off by overflow hidden
[13:35:43] <Yepp> decx: i'm trying to do the same thing
[13:35:49] <flashpoint9> Im working on a cart where I need to check if the user changes the quantity and add/remove a class based on the value of the input, this is my code http://paste.ofcode.org/847RHFwLmdGtBiWHXjwArs
[13:36:02] <flashpoint9> it only seems to work once
[13:36:16] <z1haze_work> there is any ajax function that is called before the success/error callback?
[13:36:17] <taplar> this.value
[13:36:19] <decx> and the items in the element arent positioned absolute?
[13:36:21] <z1haze_work> but after the send
[13:36:24] <taplar> don't wrap it
[13:36:59] <taplar> or only wrap it once
[13:38:06] <taplar> also parseInt(this.value, 10) that sucker
[13:38:26] <Yepp> z1haze_work ajax is async
[13:38:31] <Yepp> just put after the ajax call
[13:38:39] <Yepp> that function will not wait for the ajax
[13:39:09] <flashpoint9> oh man thats all so above my head, I suck at js/ajax
[13:39:15] <flashpoint9> sheesh
[13:39:42] <flashpoint9> there is some ajax but its in drupal and doesnt work like regular ajax
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[13:40:15] <taplar> flashpoint9: you see my comments towards your paste?
[13:40:28] <flashpoint9> drupal has built in ajax via php, its so stupid and ugly, there's no way i could explain it cause i dont really know drupal ajax that well
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> "ajax via php"?
[13:40:41] <flashpoint9> yes
[13:40:52] <taplar> you mean a http request
[13:40:57] <robertmaxrees> ajax is just making a request that doesn't require a full page reload and isn't just loading an external asset.
[13:40:58] <flashpoint9> https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!ajax.inc/group/ajax/7.x
[13:41:13] <Yepp> ajax in php hmm
[13:41:16] <flashpoint9> you can build ajax via php arrays
[13:41:22] <flashpoint9> it sucks
[13:41:24] <Yepp> ajax is a call
[13:41:28] <flashpoint9> i hate it but im stuck
[13:41:48] <flashpoint9> taplar: what do you mean?
[13:41:51] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 that's using php to generate some markup and stuff.
[13:41:55] <taplar> php dosn't run in the browser
[13:41:57] <taplar> doesn't
[13:41:57] <flashpoint9> and thus the ajax
[13:42:05] <flashpoint9> its not written in js
[13:42:08] <robertmaxrees> yes it is.
[13:42:14] <robertmaxrees> js is output to the page.
[13:42:16] <flashpoint9> no dude
[13:42:20] <flashpoint9> there is js
[13:42:27] <flashpoint9> but the drupal dev does NOT write it
[13:42:31] <flashpoint9> its just built in
[13:42:33] <taplar> php doesn't run in the browser.  ajax is from the browser
[13:42:43] <flashpoint9> yes but the php BUILDS the stuff
[13:42:44] <Yepp> php does not run in the browser so there is no ajax
[13:42:47] <Yepp> believe it or not
[13:43:00] <flashpoint9> yes I know but the php BUILDS the ajax functioanlity
[13:43:10] <taplar> sure
[13:43:10] <Yepp> php might load "ajax" script to the page
[13:43:12] <flashpoint9> just believe me, I know php doesnt run in the browser
[13:43:15] <robertmaxrees> that's very different form whaty you were saying before.
[13:43:16] <flashpoint9> no
[13:43:23] <flashpoint9> the php literally buids the ajax
[13:43:27] <Yepp> but there is no ajax function in php
[13:43:28] <taplar> script
[13:43:29] <robertmaxrees> *the js that does the ajax.
[13:43:33] <Yepp> ^
[13:43:35] <Yepp> much better
[13:43:59] <Yepp> and now the problem?
[13:44:04] <flashpoint9> yes I know there is not ajax function, in drupal there is php code that will build js/ajax for you
[13:44:11] <robertmaxrees> it builds js.
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't "build ajax"
[13:44:26] <flashpoint9> you're nitpicking
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[13:44:31] <flashpoint9> yes
[13:44:34] <Yepp> just being clear
[13:44:37] <robertmaxrees> "it builds ajax" implies that PHP somehow runs the ajax itself.
[13:44:37] <flashpoint9> ok
[13:44:45] <aro> you dont build ajax
[13:44:55] <taplar> you build relationships
[13:44:59] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:44:59] <taplar> that last a lifetime
[13:44:59] <Yepp> ajax is dead
[13:45:04] <robertmaxrees> WAT
[13:45:05] <Yepp> deadpool killed ajax
[13:45:08] <robertmaxrees> oh hahahaha
[13:45:15] <Yepp> xD
[13:45:19] <Yepp> got ya
[13:45:20] <flashpoint9> didnt want to sit here and nitpick over the way I descried how drupal deals with ajax
[13:45:31] <taplar> lol
[13:45:36] <flashpoint9> i guess ill have to figure it out myself
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* this channel lately.
[13:45:47] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 what's your question?
[13:45:55] <robertmaxrees> because js is pretty universal in how it does things.
[13:46:00] <flashpoint9> yes I know
[13:46:02] <Yepp> not staying usually here, what's with channel currently?
[13:46:03] <robertmaxrees> that's the cool part - your backend dpoesn't really matter.
[13:46:35] <flashpoint9> all i was asking is why http://paste.ofcode.org/847RHFwLmdGtBiWHXjwArs doesnt run except once
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> does something add/remove that input?
[13:47:08] <aro> what do you mean
[13:47:18] <Yepp> because the change is not triggered?
[13:47:26] <taplar> i mentioned some performance things about that snipplet that were ignored, so i guess...
[13:47:27] <aro> flashpoint9 whats your q1uestion
[13:47:39] <robertmaxrees> he already asked his question arc_
[13:47:40] <Yepp> taplar: what?
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> *aro
[13:47:55] <aro> sorry just started paying attention
[13:48:01] <taplar> not wrapping this if all your after is the value.  this.value works
[13:48:05] <taplar> or only wrap once
[13:48:09] <flashpoint9> taplar: sorry I cant repsond to 6 poeple at the same time chastising me for the exact wording I used to describe drupal and ajax
[13:48:13] <Yepp> oh that lol
[13:48:32] <Yepp> if 6 people did that to you, there might be a problem
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 we weren't chastising you duder.
[13:48:48] <Yepp> duder lol
[13:48:54] <robertmaxrees> just wanted to make sure we were all on the same page.
[13:49:01] <Yepp> does that make a dude more dude robertmaxrees? xD
[13:49:18] <taplar> it's the less formal version
[13:49:19] <Yepp> so is there a dudest guy?
[13:49:26] <Yepp> that would be great
[13:49:34] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: you're doing it again but using the word chastise now
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> so anyway
[13:49:45] <flashpoint9> why nitpicking about every word
[13:49:47] <flashpoint9> sheesh
[13:49:51] <taplar> critique isn't chastise man
[13:50:07] <Yepp> is there something wrong on correcting someone?
[13:50:08] <taplar> ^ that was chastising
[13:50:32] <robertmaxrees> alright, let's let that go.
[13:50:37] * taplar goes back to his french fries
[13:50:40] <Yepp> yea whatevs
[13:50:51] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 so is something removing that element and re-adding it or anything like that?
[13:50:53] * Yepp asks some to taplar
[13:50:59] * taplar growls
[13:51:29] <flashpoint9> robertmaxrees: yea i think that is it, ill have to dig into what drupal is doing
[13:51:31] * Yepp cringe
[13:51:32] <flashpoint9> thanks
[13:51:42] * Yepp its not very effective
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> flashpoint9 so the php wouldn't be doing that part - use a delegated listener instead.
[13:51:54] * Yepp used tackle to taplar
[13:52:00] <taplar> lol
[13:52:06] <taplar> pokemon references now?
[13:52:08] <Yepp> lol
[13:54:49] <Yepp> or how about manually doing .trigger('change') ?
[13:55:06] <robertmaxrees> Yepp he needs to fix the binding.
[13:55:31] <taplar> lol, i read that as if yepp wasn't a username
[13:55:36] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:55:38] <Yepp> hmm, php sent a response to delete something?
[13:55:52] <robertmaxrees> Yepp ... dude lol
[13:56:14] <robertmaxrees> the js that drupal loads probably deletes/adds/does something funky to the document.
[13:56:26] <robertmaxrees> if he uses a delegated listener, it should fix the problem.
[13:56:56] <Yepp> well duder, that's the reason we try to separate dom stuffs and server stuffs
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:57:16] <taplar> he just wanted to use 'duder'
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:57:29] <Yepp> ^ :O You're a witch taplar
[13:57:49] <Yepp> and at the same time i mean it too
[13:57:49] <taplar> i have no response.
[13:58:11] <robertmaxrees> Yepp you realize that drupal has framework components for the frontend too, right?
[13:58:14] <Yepp> never tried adding html, js, or anything on my server code
[13:58:23] <Yepp> nope
[13:58:25] <robertmaxrees> and your server-side code outputs html sooooooooooooooo
[13:58:31] <Yepp> never used drupal
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> lots of platforms are like that.
[13:59:01] <robertmaxrees> like wordpress.
[13:59:08] <benlieb> Is there something I need to know about calling $.ajax() in a loop? I'm having an error where an $.ajax() call basically stops without erroring when called in a loop.
[13:59:18] <benlieb> This is my short code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/58496655467cea69523151bf9bdc7f13
[13:59:38] <Yepp> error: did not catched it?
[13:59:38] <benlieb> if I call the method process_next_image() consecutively from the console, all is well
[13:59:39] <robertmaxrees> where's the loop?
[13:59:41] <Yepp> or
[13:59:55] <Yepp> fail?
[14:00:09] <benlieb> but if I call process_next_image() from a complete() callback, it stops on the next call
[14:00:35] <robertmaxrees> benlieb you mean when you recursively call the ajax call?
[14:00:48] <benlieb> the beforeCallback() is called, but then nothing else.
[14:00:59] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[14:01:09] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: Well I the loop is that in the complete callback I call then next iteration
[14:01:14] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: NOTHING
[14:01:16] <benlieb> going crazy
[14:01:25] <benlieb> I don't see fail() documented
[14:01:30] <robertmaxrees> benlieb right, that's not a loop.
[14:01:38] <Yepp> .fail() after ajax
[14:01:38] <robertmaxrees> that's recursion
[14:01:43] <Yepp> ajax().fail(
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> Yepp that's not helpful.
[14:01:52] <robertmaxrees> he already has an error callback.
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> fail won't reveal anything different.
[14:02:10] <robertmaxrees> benlieb take a look at your network tab.
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> what does it say?
[14:02:34] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: just saying for him to know. He just .fail is not documented. might be useful for him some time
[14:02:35] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: only two requests are made
[14:02:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if there's a cachebust problem.
[14:02:39] <benlieb> both successful
[14:02:42] <Yepp> just said*
[14:02:54] <robertmaxrees> Yepp that's not helpful for what he's trying to fix right now and only confuses the issue.
[14:03:18] <robertmaxrees> benlieb could you update the gist to be more indicative of your code then?
[14:03:29] <robertmaxrees> because i don't see the call to process_next_image in your complete.
[14:03:39] <taplar> ^
[14:03:44] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: right this is one of two versions
[14:03:59] <benlieb> this is without the process_next_image() in the complete, but I'll add it w/ a comment
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> benlieb i need to see the actual code then.
[14:04:12] <robertmaxrees> hard to help fix something i can't see.
[14:04:55] <taplar> i'm confused how repetative calls would return different results
[14:05:06] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e6c3c5ec61adb4887bcb107b06429172
[14:05:07] <robertmaxrees> ^ i get the feeling there's a caching issue here.
[14:05:31] <benlieb> in this version (the original) the 2nd call is in success()
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah i see it.
[14:05:44] <benlieb> the odd thing is that this script has been working for my client for 5+ years
[14:05:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the status code ont hat second call?
[14:05:57] <benlieb> but it stopped last week, or he "noticed" it last week
[14:06:46] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: as far as I can tell, the 2nd call is made, but ABSOLUTELY NO callbacks are triggered, killing the process in its tracks
[14:06:55] <benlieb> the 2nd call is successful
[14:06:59] <robertmaxrees> right, what's the status code on it though?
[14:07:05] <robertmaxrees> 200, or something else?
[14:07:13] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: yes the HTTP status is 200
[14:07:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm...
[14:07:30] <benlieb> but none of the success/error/complete callbacks are called
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery?
[14:08:05] <benlieb> v1.9.1
[14:08:19] <robertmaxrees> right - so there was a bug where some browsers didn't properly return from cached ajax calls so the callbacks wouldn't fire correctly.
[14:08:22] <benlieb> I just don't understand
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> i'd wonder if you upgraded to like 1.12 and tested if the problem would go away.
[14:08:39] <benlieb> hm
[14:08:51] <benlieb> will try lemme see
[14:09:58] <benlieb> it's buried in a rails     = javascript_include_tag "application" call hrm
[14:10:10] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> the jquery include?
[14:10:23] <robertmaxrees> doesn't it have some kind of weird asset pipeling you can override?
[14:11:03] <benlieb> might take a sec
[14:11:10] <benlieb> /= require jquery
[14:11:11] <benlieb> /= require jquery_ujs
[14:11:19] <benlieb> have to go through rails to upgrade
[14:12:00] <benlieb> gem 'jquery-rails'               , '~> 2.2.1'
[14:12:55] <robertmaxrees> looks like that gem is on v 4.2.1 now.
[14:17:01] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: the app is rails 3.2, so I seem to not be able to go above jquery 1.11 (gem 3.1.4)
[14:17:08] <robertmaxrees> that's fine/.
[14:20:30] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: still stalls
[14:20:31] <benlieb> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/93ea243f1b1769274e0e953ed40b0920
[14:21:10] <benlieb> the console shows that the second "loop" quits after the call (only the beforeSend is called), but none of the post-request callbacks are triggered, even though it is successful.
[14:22:13] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.  i'd have to see it fail.
[14:23:04] <taplar> just for shiggles, have you tried putting cache: false on the ajax object?
[14:23:15] <robertmaxrees> oh, good call.
[14:23:16] <benlieb> taplar: no
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> give that a shot.
[14:23:28] <benlieb> I don't really know what that is exactly, but can try
[14:23:44] <robertmaxrees> add a prop to the config - cache: false,
[14:23:59] <benlieb> I just found a hack solution though
[14:24:08] <robertmaxrees> try the cache thing instead of a hack heh.
[14:24:10] <benlieb> I put process_next_image(); in a timeout(0
[14:24:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't do that.
[14:24:23] <benlieb> I'll try it. I'd like to understand the issue too
[14:24:48] <taplar> cache: false will transform the url so that it will not cache the request
[14:25:09] <benlieb> ah ok, yeah the url is the same every time. that's probably the issue
[14:25:40] <taplar> which if it is caching, then getting multiple 200s is strange
[14:25:42] <robertmaxrees> but if the browser is reporting a 200, that means it's reaching the server and might not be looking at cache.
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:25:52] <robertmaxrees> something is whacked here.
[14:26:37] <benlieb> that seems to have worked
[14:26:41] <benlieb> will try one more time
[14:26:44] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, it's that cache bug.
[14:27:40] <benlieb> yeah that works
[14:27:48] <benlieb> damn 4 hours I have to bill my client
[14:28:08] <benlieb> for something that's been working for years
[14:28:11] <taplar> one might say it was indeed......... a cache issue
[14:28:14] <benlieb> oh well
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[14:28:21] <benlieb> so what exactly changed?
[14:28:26] <benlieb> not jquery
[14:28:29] <benlieb> the browser then
[14:28:36] <robertmaxrees> you forced the browser to not do cached requests.
[14:29:07] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: I see this, but this must never have been needed at some point in the recent past.
[14:29:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:29:15] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:29:21] <robertmaxrees> the server may have changed.
[14:29:22] <benlieb> the script has been working for about 5 years
[14:29:25] <robertmaxrees> or the browser is handling it differently.
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> also:
[14:29:44] <benlieb> it's an ugly script and I don't like looking at it :)
[14:29:50] <robertmaxrees> people often like to say "well it was working until recently" and then when you check your logs you find out they haven't looked at it in 4
[14:29:58] <benlieb> but it worked, and now I might solve it with websockets
[14:29:59] <benlieb> but
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:30:11] <robertmaxrees> don't use websockets for this imo.
[14:30:29] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: haha
[14:30:36] <robertmaxrees> why is that funny?
[14:30:40] <benlieb> but the have used it, and you can see here: http://carolinamountainwoodturners.org/monthly_galleries/browse
[14:30:55] <benlieb> they are like obsessive. I had forgotten about them
[14:31:05] <benlieb> but apparently they use the app site a lot
[14:31:08] <benlieb> app / site
[14:31:20] <robertmaxrees> really lost about why they need websockets
[14:31:21] <benlieb> wasn't meant to be fancy
[14:31:27] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: they don't
[14:31:43] <benlieb> but they upload all these images to S3 and want to turn them into galleries
[14:31:54] <benlieb> the processing needs to be triggered by an admin from he browser
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> so then have your server-side generate all that.
[14:32:24] <benlieb> app is on Heroku with 30 sec timout
[14:32:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:32:31] <benlieb> so have to do the looping in JS
[14:32:40] <robertmaxrees> is this the free tier?
[14:32:48] <benlieb> don't remember
[14:32:57] <benlieb> set it up a long time ago. prob not free
[14:33:16] <robertmaxrees> 30 minutes or 30 seconds
[14:33:49] <robertmaxrees> 'cause really it sounds like you need to rethink how you're doing things.
[14:35:04] <benlieb> It's an old app, and I'm happy to let it rot :)
[14:35:14] <benlieb> I haven't heard from them in years
[14:35:30] <benlieb> I told them a couple of years ago they should invest in yearly updates
[14:35:33] <aro> so is there a way to get the $field jquery objects that were submitted with a form submit?
[14:35:37] <benlieb> anyway
[14:35:52] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: taplar: thanks for the help!
[14:36:37] <robertmaxrees> aro sure
[14:37:25] <aro> how do i get those?
[14:37:32] <robertmaxrees> are you in the submit handler?
[14:37:35] <aro> yes
[14:38:03] <robertmaxrees> $('#theForm').find('input');
[14:38:09] <aro> that returns all inputs
[14:38:12] <aro> even ones that werent submitted
[14:38:23] <robertmaxrees> how are they not submitting?
[14:38:39] <aro> ??
[14:38:43] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: taplar: I wonder if setting         type : 'GET', to POST would have fixed this as well, and maybe not ever been cached.
[14:38:52] <benlieb> Technically I shouldn't have used GET
[14:39:02] <robertmaxrees> benlieb some browser cache those responses as well.
[14:39:04] <aro> if one of those input elements is disabled, it still shows up in that find request
[14:39:05] <Yepp> maybe he means input like gender where there are 2 option with the same name robertmaxrees
[14:39:15] <Yepp> then just filter it
[14:39:17] <robertmaxrees> aro then .filter()
[14:39:21] <benlieb> I'll check the docs
[14:39:27] <aro> what does filter do
[14:39:32] <robertmaxrees> benlieb the docs won't tell you about various browser quirks fwiw.
[14:39:34] <Yepp> filter the results of find
[14:39:39] <Yepp> or whatever
[14:39:43] <robertmaxrees> aro you'd user filter() to remove the elements you don't care about.
[14:39:48] <aro> how do i filter out disabled ones, or radio buttons that werent selected
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs and give it a try :)
[14:40:11] <benlieb> robertmaxrees: If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser. Note: Setting cache to false will only work correctly with HEAD and GET requests. It works by appending "_={timestamp}" to the GET parameters. The parameter is not needed for other types of requests, except in IE8 when a POST is made to a URL that has already been requested by a GET.
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> show us where you get stuck.
[14:40:24] <Yepp> filter then return that has no selected,checked, this value, etc property
[14:40:50] <aro> thats gonna remove everything
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> benlieb what jquery tries to do and fix and what browsers are doing in their low level networking are two different things ;)
[14:41:14] <robertmaxrees> aro you'd refine the filter to only remove the ones you don't want.
[14:43:13] <aro> if i use a function inside the filter, and it returns true - does that remove? or does false remove
[14:44:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:44:36] <aro> im on there now, but it doesnt say
[14:44:43] <robertmaxrees> true = keep
[14:44:45] <robertmaxrees> false = remove
[14:45:24] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/XY9wQ8A.png the examples show you how it works.
[14:45:33] <robertmaxrees> hence my linking to them.
[14:50:19] <aro> http://pastebin.com/gpN3w8d7
[14:50:58] <robertmaxrees> return !$(obj).prop('disabled') imo
[14:51:15] <robertmaxrees> or even just return !obj.disabled;
[14:52:14] <aro> ok
[14:52:22] <robertmaxrees> but that's the basic idea.
[14:52:45] <aro> let me try that
[14:53:10] <aro> that... doesnt really work
[14:53:10] <aro> hmm
[14:53:14] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[14:53:21] <aro> just returns a form object
[14:53:23] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:53:26] <aro> ok
[14:53:30] <aro> i want input elements
[14:53:32] <aro> not a form object
[14:53:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:53:37] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:53:42] <robertmaxrees> sooo make a fiddle.
[14:54:11] <aro> can i use codepen
[14:54:14] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:54:16] <robertmaxrees> anything, really.
[14:54:20] <robertmaxrees> just hate dealing int he abstract.
[14:54:25] <aro> i am banned from fiddle
[14:54:31] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:54:40] <aro> yeah man
[14:54:46] <aro> they banned my ip and deleted my account
[14:54:54] <robertmaxrees> what'd you do?
[14:55:00] <aro> i said something about the owners mom
[14:55:06] <robertmaxrees> oh
[14:57:04] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8zqkggoj/
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha
[14:58:11] <robertmaxrees> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/VKZGWQ?editors=1010#0
[14:58:14] <robertmaxrees> that works fine.
[14:58:44] <roflmyeggo> decx taplar: i believe ive figured it out in case you are interested (the .val() on change() method in IE 11 issue before)
[14:59:13] <roflmyeggo> it seems that IE11 considers the removal of the file from an input, even programatically with val() as a "change" event
[14:59:35] <aro> i create an amazing pen
[14:59:36] <aro> http://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/wzrEdO
[14:59:38] <aro> click that
[14:59:42] <aro> look at it
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> aro did you not look at the example I sent?
[15:00:06] <aro> i did, mine shows my problem
[15:00:26] <decx> that's not how filter works
[15:00:30] <aro> :(
[15:00:32] <aro> what
[15:00:42] <robertmaxrees> $.each($fields, function(i, obj) { wrong each
[15:01:19] <robertmaxrees> var $field = $form.find('input[name="' + obj.name + '"]'); what are youa ctually trying to accomplish here?
[15:01:46] <aro> ignore that part
[15:01:50] <roflmyeggo> is there anyway for me to prevent a change event from occurring from a val() change?
[15:02:04] <roflmyeggo> well, any change for that matter
[15:02:30] <robertmaxrees> aro so you need to make this a little more robust
[15:02:36] <aro> explain
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> since you need to account for radios.
[15:02:43] <aro> i know
[15:02:45] <taplar> roflmyeggo: google "javascript, preventDefault"
[15:02:45] <aro> thats what i said earlier
[15:02:49] <robertmaxrees> so then account for them.
[15:02:56] <aro> how
[15:03:06] <robertmaxrees> how do you think you would?
[15:03:10] <aro> i just want to remove radios that are not checked, checkboxes that are not checked
[15:03:11] <aro> errm
[15:03:13] <aro> i think
[15:03:16] <aro> if i had to guess
[15:03:28] <aro> $('input').not(':radio')
[15:03:30] <aro> something liek that?
[15:03:39] <robertmaxrees> that just removes the radios.
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> and the issue is radios that aren't "checked"
[15:03:58] <aro> doh
[15:04:03] <aro> i didnt think before i typed
[15:04:27] <aro> $('input').is(':radio:not(:checked)');
[15:04:31] <aro> is that better
[15:04:52] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember if radios work with that.
[15:04:58] <robertmaxrees> i always just use .filter()
[15:05:03] <robertmaxrees> and it's more complicated than that.
[15:05:08] <aro> well thats what i was going to put in filter
[15:05:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean i check the actual properties and things instead of using selectors.
[15:05:44] <decx> it's 2016, you can just use the required attribute for clientside validation
[15:06:12] <robertmaxrees> decx that's a good point.  just polyfill for browsers that don't have it.
[15:06:19] <decx> indeed
[15:06:20] <robertmaxrees> or use one of the existing libs.
[15:15:46] <aro> so how does filter work
[15:15:58] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[15:15:58] <aro> if i have the function
[15:16:33] <robertmaxrees> it returns a new jquery object with the elements that pass the filter test.
[15:23:54] <aro> robert
[15:24:09] <aro> how do i just filter from a set of elements fromt he form?
[15:32:14] <taplar> hmm, did something happen?
[15:35:49] <Guest58077> taplar: on the whole server? i guess so
[15:35:58] <Guest58077> and now my name is guest
[15:36:10] <taplar> yeah, quite a few peeps turned guest
[15:36:24] <Guest58077> i cant change my nick
[15:39:36] <Yepp> regain works
[15:40:08] * taplar hopped into freenode to watch the fun
[15:54:11] <Yepp> what does `score` do in the Remote example here: http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ ?
[15:54:45] <roflmyeggo> taplar: im somewhat familiar with preventDefault, but what if I need to prevent a handler from firing when invoking val() on an element?
[15:56:10] <taplar> so you want to ignore it if it's val() but not if the user does it?
[15:57:13] <roflmyeggo> taplar: yeah, i just need to change the val() of the input without triggering the change() event
[15:57:16] <taplar> you'd have to look at the event and see if there is anything on it different in that case that you could check
[15:57:31] <roflmyeggo> taplar: so basically just some conditional logic within the handler?
[15:57:42] <taplar> cause if IE is making it an event identical to a user event, idk how you would distinguish between the two
[15:58:05] <roflmyeggo> is it bad practice to check the browser? something like if (ie11) { return false }?
[15:58:28] <taplar> but then your change would never work in ie
[15:58:39] <roflmyeggo> taplar: hah, good point ^_^
[15:59:06] <taplar> what's the harm in letting it process?
[15:59:52] <roflmyeggo> taplar: theres a method that deals with the file, and i am removing the file using val(), so then the logic expects a file
[16:00:16] <roflmyeggo> i could go dig downstream further and make that more robust but i thought i would check if theres a way to deal with it using jQuery first
[16:00:57] <taplar> no, if this is indeed IE11 making the change event when a value changes, that is outside of jQuery
[16:01:19] <taplar> i thought others earlier though were saying they could not reproduce it in IE11
[16:01:30] <roflmyeggo> taplar: ok thanks
[16:01:37] <roflmyeggo> yeah i tried to reproduce it as well and failed
[16:01:42] <taplar> so...
[16:01:45] <roflmyeggo> the only way you can reproduce it is with an input element specifically
[16:02:26] <roflmyeggo> .val() doesnt trigger the change event unless its making a state change from an input select with a file to no file
[16:02:31] <roflmyeggo> weird IE-11-ness
[16:03:35] <taplar> <input type="file"> ?
[16:04:23] <roflmyeggo> taplar: yeah
[16:07:21] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1703228/how-can-i-clear-an-html-file-input-with-javascript  offers different ways of clearing a file input field
[16:07:28] <taplar> one of the others may not trigger the change
[16:07:31] <taplar> maybe
[16:07:41] <Yepp> what does score do here? http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/ Remote example
[16:08:03] <roflmyeggo> taplar: thanks taplar
[16:08:30] <Guest2949> Yepp provides weighting.
[16:08:38] <Yepp> sorting?
[16:09:41] <taplar> https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md
[16:09:54] <taplar> under callbacks
[16:09:56] <Yepp> yea, just confuses me a bit
[16:10:15] <Guest2949> it's based on match quality.
[16:10:35] <Yepp> yea, got it now. just making sure i understand it
[16:10:50] <taplar> gotta know the quality before you try to score
[16:11:13] <taplar> otherwise you need to include the other option of beer
[16:11:53] <taplar> Selectize!  sponsered by Miller Lite
[16:12:02] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[16:12:09] <taplar> hmm?
[16:12:20] <duch_kazatel> won't let me take back my normal name.
[16:12:24] <duch_kazatel> "temporarily unavailable".
[16:12:28] <taplar> there was a netsplit or something earlier
[16:12:29] <Darmani> So my javascript isn't seeing my search form for some reason. I have no idea why.
[16:12:32] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/cbe328c45e0c24f9f40e7f80526ebce4#file-articles-js
[16:13:06] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[16:13:12] <taplar> it's hard to read ungenerated html... Darmani
[16:13:31] <duch_kazatel> Darmani make a fiddle with actual html.
[16:13:54] <Yepp> do regain
[16:14:04] <Darmani> It's just a slim template that's why it looks retarded
[16:14:09] <Darmani> believe me not my choice.
[16:14:10] <taplar> woah, your submit() is weird
[16:14:22] <taplar> $('#articles_search').submit(function()) { <-- that ain't right
[16:14:34] <Darmani> taplar: It's not? :o
[16:14:40] <taplar> (function()) ?
[16:14:45] <Yepp> you're bracket is outside
[16:14:52] <robertmaxrees> there we gop.
[16:15:10] <taplar> yeah, that's probably a syntax error
[16:15:15] <Yepp> did you regain?
[16:15:19] <Darmani> my bad, I didn't see that.
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> i got my nick again.
[16:15:33] <Yepp> why is there no server message? hmm
[16:15:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:15:49] <Yepp> shouldn't server say something like xxx is now know as robertmaxrees?
[16:15:59] <robertmaxrees> i saw it happen (shrug)
[16:16:03] <taplar> me 2
[16:16:11] <Darmani> oh cool the js responds to my button at least
[16:16:15] <Darmani> ty ^.^
[16:16:24] <taplar> syntax errors can cause the whole thing to die
[16:16:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:16:29] <taplar> always check your console, ;)
[16:16:32] <Yepp> look at the console
[16:16:48] <Darmani> The console didn't print an error though..
[16:16:59] <taplar> make sure you have all js logs enabled
[16:17:30] <taplar> i forget if that's covered in the fixingthesejquery site
[16:17:44] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[16:17:58] <Yepp> is it possible to make jQuery components? how cool would that be
[16:18:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:18:06] <robertmaxrees> "components"?
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> like... plugins?
[16:19:03] <Yepp> err maybe yea, it's plugin what I'm looking for. Sometimes I find myself repeating something that's similar to the use of components
[16:19:31] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying component - what do you define that as?
[16:19:39] <taplar> you can use the plugin api, or attach to $ directly if it's not dependent upon selected elements
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> though that's really just making the function globally available.
[16:20:05] <taplar> though if your not going to share it out, might as well make your own namespace
[16:20:21] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[16:20:26] <Yepp> robertmaxrees: similar to a react component. A component with elements that also receive something that it uses
[16:20:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:20:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea with jquery fwiw
[16:20:56] <Yepp> i dunno. just random thoughts
[16:20:58] <Yepp> lol
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery's just a dom abstraction library.  not a full-fledged framework.
[16:21:38] <Yepp> there are some times that i want to use react/vue/etc but would be an overkill if jquery alone can just do it.
[16:21:43] <Yepp> just finding a lazy way
[16:21:56] <robertmaxrees> but if you want to use them, how is it overkill?
[16:22:14] <taplar> what is a component?  you talking about a jsx object?
[16:22:38] <robertmaxrees> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html
[16:22:41] <Yepp> i'll be more comparing to react
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-api.html
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> the jsx + associated logic.
[16:22:52] <Yepp> it's because you can just write it less on jq?
[16:22:57] <taplar> ah
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:23:15] <Yepp> i can only find react useful if stuffs will be more complicated
[16:23:31] <robertmaxrees> "more complicated" than what?
[16:23:56] <Yepp> more processing, chained actions/events, etc
[16:24:15] <robertmaxrees> "processing"?
[16:24:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:24:22] <robertmaxrees> ain't nothing wrong with using react.
[16:24:45] <taplar> unless your trying to run it all in the browser, in which case i cried.
[16:24:54] <Yepp> yea, but for simple thing like, on button click make this red
[16:25:07] <Yepp> http://hackflow.com/blog/2015/03/08/boiling-react-down-to-few-lines-in-jquery/
[16:25:17] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:25:17] <Yepp> hope you get what I mean
[16:25:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd use react for the whole site.
[16:25:24] <Darmani> So this button here registers a response on the console but it doesn't do anything.
[16:25:25] <Darmani> https://snag.gy/LzW581.jpg
[16:25:25] <robertmaxrees> not for just a button.
[16:25:27] <Yepp> not hating react, i actually love it
[16:25:36] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying you're hating it.
[16:25:38] <Darmani> Any ideas whyy?
[16:25:39] <Yepp> but sometimes it's just not the right tool for a job
[16:25:40] <taplar> that's a picture
[16:25:43] <taplar> i see no code
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> Yepp you'd never use it for a single event binding - you'd use it for the entire page.
[16:26:06] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/cbe328c45e0c24f9f40e7f80526ebce4#file-articles-js
[16:26:17] <Yepp> that's my point lol
[16:26:29] <robertmaxrees> so then your entire point is sort of weird.
[16:26:41] <robertmaxrees> Darmani make a functioning fiddle.
[16:26:48] <robertmaxrees> with actual HTML and stuff.
[16:27:02] <taplar> still haven't fixed the syntax on that one part
[16:27:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:27:18] <Darmani> uggg.
[16:27:27] <taplar> :)
[16:30:40] <tim_v> hello, All - I am looking for a way to snag a screenshot of a page to an image, the closest thing I can find to do this is phantomjs, but it will not work behind authenticated pages (working on a "report a bug" button for users that captures screen, relative source files, at that point in time.)
[16:31:09] <robertmaxrees> gonna have to have a way for a third party to hit that page.
[16:31:19] <Yepp> wow, i just wasted a whole day with 0 progress on project
[16:31:55] <taplar> i think one of our groups found a way to take a screen shot with js
[16:32:04] <taplar> may have been paired with a js pdf maker, i forget
[16:32:08] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:32:16] <robertmaxrees> we just use usersnap.
[16:33:31] <tim_v> it's all custom code I'm working with, so robertmaxrees - your idea may work, though I'm interested in the pdf capture thought
[16:33:45] <taplar> http://www.jquerybyexample.net/2013/08/take-webpage-screenshot-html5-jquery-javascript.html
[16:33:50] <taplar> i forget which one it was
[16:34:05] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4912092/using-html5-canvas-javascript-to-take-screenshots/6678156#6678156
[16:34:08] <robertmaxrees> iiiiiiiinteresting.
[16:34:15] <robertmaxrees> wonder what browser support looks like.
[16:34:54] <decx> doesnt that involve writing a html parser and rendering engine for canvas
[16:34:57] <taplar> it would have had to have worked in chrome.  our group that tinkered with it mainly uses chrome
[16:35:02] <decx> yep html2canvas
[16:35:24] <tim_v> awesome, thanks guys I'll check these out. :)
[16:35:45] <decx> cant you stringify document ^^
[16:36:03] <robertmaxrees> decx that's not helpful since you want to see how the browser actually rendered it.
[16:36:20] <robertmaxrees> that canvas idea may not be terribly helpful either - but that stringify...
[16:36:29] <decx> it was a joke
[16:36:40] <robertmaxrees> but was it?
[16:36:45] <tim_v> well, I'm presuming you all know the goal
[16:36:52] <tim_v> IT gets an email, "it's broken"
[16:36:54] <robertmaxrees> tim_v right, you want screenshots of errors.
[16:36:57] <decx> window all the way down
[16:37:00] <taplar> yup
[16:37:11] <taplar> not even just errors
[16:37:14] <taplar> suggestions
[16:37:21] <taplar> "hey, it'd be cool if..."
[16:37:25] <tim_v> distance from keyboard, what moon it is
[16:37:31] <taplar> see what they saw that would prompt that thought
[16:37:34] <robertmaxrees> right, we use usersnap of exactly that - why not stringify, ship to the server, then use an automated service to render that with whatever browser matches the captured UA
[16:37:35] <robertmaxrees> hrmmmmmm
[16:38:46] <taplar> is usersnap the one that allows the users to highlight the part they want to snap?
[16:38:53] <taplar> i know i've seen those fancy ones before
[16:39:20] <robertmaxrees> you can highlight, draw, etc.
[16:39:28] <robertmaxrees> also captures all js errors on the page, too.
[16:39:37] <taplar> those are sweet
[16:39:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:39:48] <robertmaxrees> our helpdesk really likes it.
[16:39:55] <tim_v> that'd be awesome, but I know the guys here would say "I'm too busy, that's your guys job"
[16:40:03] <tim_v> lol
[16:40:13] <robertmaxrees> was pretty easy to setup usersnap, but fair enough.
[16:40:44] <taplar> we don't capture images in my current app.  we just have a feeback option that captures things like the url and such and then later someone may follow up with the user if more details are needed.
[16:41:38] <taplar> we've considered making them automatically make mingle cards, but haven't gone there yet
[16:42:21] <tim_v> ah, well in the very least - a lot of the tools we've developed are driven from csv/db queries, it's pretty easy to grab the current state of the results and send an email - the screenshot, though - would be useful in scenarios where it's not really an error, but a misinterpretation of the result
[16:42:53] <decx> hm reasonable prices on usersnap, good suggestion
[16:42:54] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:43:16] <decx> had to include a terrible live support chat system for a client a year ago
[16:43:29] <decx> nobody ever used it
[16:43:51] <taplar> i hate going to websites that have live support, but it's only during normal business hours.  i'm working normal business hours, lol
[16:44:10] <robertmaxrees> we actually have it so very few people here are actually able to submit tickets straight to anybody else.
[16:44:19] <robertmaxrees> want sodev to do it?  go through helpdesk or a pm.
[16:44:21] <robertmaxrees> no exceptions.
[16:44:36] <tim_v> I say route all complaints through sales
[16:44:45] <taplar> -_-
[16:44:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:44:54] <tim_v> we do :)
[16:44:56] <robertmaxrees> our sales people are where most of our reports come from.
[17:01:07] <tim_v> actually - I think I may be able to do something similar to what you mentioned robertmaxrees, using the ob* functions in PHP
[17:01:17] <robertmaxrees> no idea what those are.
[17:01:56] <tim_v> captures the buffer
[17:02:10] <robertmaxrees> you don't care about the buffer though :)
[17:02:19] <robertmaxrees> the state of the page can be changed by the frontend.
[17:03:28] <tim_v> but I had a retort!

[17:45:17] <catbadger> oops
[17:45:32] <catbadger> anyone know if there's an irc room for jqgrid?
[17:45:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:45:51] <robertmaxrees> doesn't look like it.
[17:47:12] <Yepp> how do i insert &#8369 in js?
[17:48:55] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:49:31] <Yepp> how to insert symbols like that?
[17:49:59] <taplar> insert where?
[17:50:03] <Yepp> html entities
[17:50:22] <Yepp> trying to insert something like '<div>&#8369</div>'
[17:50:50] <arc_> https://jsfiddle.net/8ra6frdy/
[17:50:50] <taplar> html('&#8369'); ?
[17:50:59] <Yepp> without .html()
[17:51:04] <amigooo> hey guys, I am struggling with storing my success(data) into a global variable, because of it being asynchron. I tried many things, but I still don't get the information into my global var.... Can someone please help me? http://pastebin.com/mD1Y8zs6
[17:51:07] <arc_> lol
[17:51:09] <Yepp> passing it in render callback of selectize
[17:51:38] <Yepp> err no nvm
[17:51:42] <taplar> amigooo: it's async dude
[17:51:52] <taplar> your console.log is happening before the request finishes
[17:52:04] <robertmaxrees> Yepp https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ozuhdkyg/1/
[17:52:25] <amigooo> taplar: I know. that's why I tried this method with .done to get the data then, but it still doesn't work
[17:52:32] <amigooo> how can I get it into the global var?
[17:52:42] <robertmaxrees> amigooo that's a little funky.
[17:52:54] <taplar> why not pass it into whatever method will use it?
[17:52:54] <robertmaxrees> because other things could access the global var before it's the right value.
[17:54:03] <taplar> and it's a global so it could linger around long after it has been used
[17:54:06] <amigooo> taplar: Because I need a var that will store an a certain amount, and needs this amount later
[17:54:29] <amigooo> means I need a variable that holds the value
[17:54:37] <amigooo> for other purposes later
[17:54:51] <robertmaxrees> amigooo then set the global to the deferred from the ajax call and use .then() as needed.
[17:55:26] <amigooo> I don't know how that works robertmaxrees
[17:55:34] <robertmaxrees> window.myAjaxCall = $.ajax({/* yer settings here */});
[17:55:42] <taplar> in any case ln 15 should be working
[17:55:57] <robertmaxrees> then when you need that data, window.myAjaxCall.then(function(data) { /* use data as needed here */ });
[17:56:51] <amigooo> okay let me try hold on
[18:00:18] <SamSagaZ> hey guys, is possible that jquery wont works if i use firefox/chrome from linux and if use firefox/chrome from windows works?
[18:00:26] <SamSagaZ> i cant figure why that happend :/
[18:00:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:00:28] <robertmaxrees> should work fine.
[18:00:39] <SamSagaZ> not in my home :/
[18:00:46] <robertmaxrees> what's broken?
[18:01:24] <SamSagaZ> well, im using jqxComboBox (from jqwidgets) and wont work under linux
[18:01:35] <amigooo> I mean it is still bascially the same @robertmaxrees... it is still asynchron and I can't really work with it..
[18:01:39] <SamSagaZ> dont know if its an jquery or jqwidget problem
[18:01:49] <robertmaxrees> SamSagaZ mnake a fiddle.
[18:02:00] <robertmaxrees> amigooo using the deferred m,akes that part irrelevant.
[18:02:05] <SamSagaZ> ok, let me see
[18:02:08] <robertmaxrees> you still can't set the data to a global object.
[18:03:33] <amigooo> I mean it can't really be so impossible to get data from a PHP script and store it in a javascript var/array...
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not your probolem.
[18:04:19] <robertmaxrees> your problem is purely that it's async.
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> and it's a bad design to hold data set via async in a global variable.
[18:04:32] <amigooo> yes, I have read that I could set it to synchron
[18:04:41] <robertmaxrees> that's a terrible idea.
[18:04:47] <amigooo> yes I have read that...
[18:04:50] <robertmaxrees> so don'
[18:04:54] <robertmaxrees> *don't do it/.
[18:05:41] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to rethink your application's design a bit.
[18:05:55] <amigooo> thing is: I need a certain amount from a PHP script (database). And I need to compare it "sometimes" if the amount is still current.
[18:06:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:06:18] <amigooo> so I need the amount for a certain time, that's why I wanted to store it in a variable
[18:06:20] <robertmaxrees> like, comparing when the user clicks something?
[18:06:36] <amigooo> yes for instance
[18:06:47] <robertmaxrees> then fire the ajax call when the user clicks.
[18:06:53] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just put that data in the page on pageload.
[18:07:07] <ircbaao> hi guys need help please. I am trying to sort an object in alphabetically http://kopy.io/G1yr1 but it doesn't seem to work for me.
[18:07:20] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao you cannot sort objects.
[18:07:22] <robertmaxrees> only arrays.
[18:07:26] <ircbaao> the object have "id" and name
[18:07:49] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, hi if i do console.log(row.name) it get all the names
[18:07:56] <ircbaao> i get all the name
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> what is Main.Object ?
[18:08:07] <amigooo> robertmaxrees: if I do it onload I still get the problem, that I need the value somewhere then :P... stupid idea but could I workaround it with setting a hidden attribute like a input text??
[18:08:26] <robertmaxrees> amigooo errr, or in a global variable in a script tag at your server.
[18:08:28] <robertmaxrees> that's what i mean.
[18:08:45] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao you're returning an array of arrays.
[18:08:51] <ircbaao> its a json or array when i do console.log(Main.Object) i get "object, object, object, ..... "
[18:09:05] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, yep
[18:09:11] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao can you make a fiddle?
[18:09:38] <amigooo> robertmaxrees: in a script tag? That won't work.. I mean it is the same problem then like now. it is asynchron and it won't store it..
[18:09:43] <robertmaxrees> amigooo ...
[18:09:49] <amigooo> :D
[18:09:52] <robertmaxrees> you don't use ajax with what i'm suggesting.
[18:09:58] <amigooo> ah
[18:09:58] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao oh btw your var b only exists in that foreach callback.
[18:10:01] <robertmaxrees> scoping problem.
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> amigooo you're write it out as apart of the page itself.,
[18:10:55] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, dont worry about var b
[18:11:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:11:18] <robertmaxrees> "don't worry about this syntax error that causes the whole script to fail" ;)
[18:11:29] <taplar> course
[18:11:39] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, dont worry i only copy part of the code
[18:11:43] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao lol
[18:11:45] <ircbaao> var b was all the way on top
[18:11:57] <ircbaao> so just copy it and put it somewhere
[18:11:57] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[18:12:27] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, how will i sort it and get name?
[18:12:34] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[18:12:57] <ircbaao> good idea thought of that
[18:13:17] <ircbaao> but console.log gives me arrays of array
[18:13:39] <robertmaxrees> that's great.
[18:13:41] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle :)
[18:13:56] * taplar looks at all the teeth on the floor
[18:15:10] <taplar> i like how the only jQuery in this thing is map
[18:17:33] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[18:19:20] <amigooo> I by the way still don't know how to fix it :( :P ... so again: on pageload I need to get a number and an array from the database (via PHP and AJAX). And at some clicks I need to check if the number has changed in the meantime and if yes I need to get the new values from the DB again and store it back in JS
[18:19:28] <amigooo> so bascially it is a handshake all the time
[18:19:43] <robertmaxrees> amigooo then do it on click./
[18:21:04] <amigooo> yes robertmaxrees I would do it on click lick $(..).click( $ajax(...data:{amount:amount}...))
[18:21:09] <amigooo> *like
[18:21:17] <amigooo> but I need the amount!!
[18:21:25] <amigooo> that is stored somewhere
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call happens there.
[18:21:45] <robertmaxrees> in the click.
[18:22:26] <amigooo> and where do I get the parameters to send with the ajax request from?
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:22:38] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting them now?
[18:23:05] <amigooo> for the first "initalize" I don't need them. I just need the current number from the database
[18:23:14] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the initialize at all.
[18:23:24] <robertmaxrees> i don't get why you're overcomplicating this so much.
[18:23:28] <amigooo> ajax -> php -> json -> back to js -> store it in a global var in JS
[18:23:32] <robertmaxrees> nope.,
[18:23:36] <robertmaxrees> stop with the global var.
[18:23:42] <robertmaxrees> do the ajax call each time.
[18:26:38] <amigooo> I think we don't understand each other :D how do I send the value to the PHP script on click, when there is nowhere stored the current value anywhere?
[18:27:15] <robertmaxrees> the clicked value?
[18:27:16] <amigooo> I need to send the value to the php script, that I got once from the php script
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> put it in the page on pageload.
[18:27:32] <amigooo> to compare if it has changed and it still the same in the database
[18:27:58] <robertmaxrees> literally when you output the page on pageload include a script tag - <script> window.someRandomValue = thePhpVarWithTheValue </script>
[18:28:44] <amigooo> you mean like <script>var a = <?php .... $value .. ?> </script>
[18:28:45] <amigooo> ?
[18:28:50] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[18:29:03] <robertmaxrees> use the window. though
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> makes it clearer.
[18:29:19] <taplar> <input type="hidden" id="initialValue" value="<?= $value ?>">
[18:29:25] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[18:29:57] <taplar> <body data-initialValue="<?= $value ?>">
[18:29:59] <taplar> whatever
[18:30:11] <amigooo> I could also $("#hidden).val(data)... from the ajax request?
[18:30:29] <robertmaxrees> sure, or if you did window.someThingHere you could update that.
[18:30:50] <robertmaxrees> though something about your UI seems way funky.
[18:30:51] <robertmaxrees> but w/e
[18:31:09] <amigooo> does it also work with arrays? Can I change the value of a input and append a array ?
[18:31:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:31:20] <robertmaxrees> not without stringifying.
[18:31:26] <robertmaxrees> so use the global var instead.
[18:31:52] <taplar> the explosion of requirements begins
[18:31:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:32:33] <amigooo> problem about the global <?php tag inside a script tag is that I constantely need to update the value via ajax, not only once..
[18:32:38] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:32:42] <robertmaxrees> you can still update that.
[18:32:43] <robertmaxrees> using js.
[18:32:54] <taplar> it's in the dom.  it's changable
[18:32:59] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:33:20] <taplar> i only made the <body> version cause you don't even need a lookup for that
[18:33:39] <taplar> $(document.body).data('initialValue')
[18:33:47] <taplar> $(document.body).data('initialvalue')
[18:33:49] <amigooo> I would have the same problem though. When I use an ajax request later, I will need to update the value in the success message and based on asychnron, well then we are are back :D
[18:33:52] <taplar> lowercase, :s
[18:34:00] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:34:04] <taplar> $(document.body).data('initialvalue', 'newvalue')
[18:34:17] <robertmaxrees> amigooo can you better explain what you're building?
[18:34:24] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're leaving out something really relevant her.e
[18:35:13] <amigooo> ahmm.. taplar would that also work within the ajax request or same problem like global var?
[18:35:19] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[18:35:22] <robertmaxrees> same problems.
[18:35:22] <taplar> document.body is global
[18:35:31] <robertmaxrees> just changes where you're storing it.
[18:35:36] <amigooo> yes
[18:35:37] <amigooo> okay so
[18:38:45] <amigooo> I will explain what I am building, it is not actually a big thing: I am having a table that I want to sort, but it also refreshes automatically after a period of time (there are constantely new entries coming in). Moreover I don't want to display the whole table, I want to limit it for instance for 10 and on click I will load the next 10 entries, so 10 news with every click. So let's say 30
[18:38:45] <amigooo> entries are loaded I want to sort those 30. That's why I need to check how much entries the user has currently "opened" AND especially WHICH ones (I store the IDs of one entry in an array). So I need to know when I want to sort -> which entries does the user see currently and what exactly he wants to sort, so I need to send parameters to the database and sort it and get the data sorted back
[18:38:45] <amigooo> and display it
[18:38:48] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[18:38:52] <amigooo> haha sorry
[18:39:26] <catbadger> you need jqgrid
[18:39:37] <catbadger> ok so I have a jqgrid... there are seperate tables for the header rows and the grid itself. when the grid renders in chrome under 1200px wide, the grid headers alignment goes a little wonky. the header columns are ignoring the css set on the html elements.
[18:39:45] <robertmaxrees> amigooo sooo
[18:40:03] <robertmaxrees> amigooo where does the data comparison come into play?
[18:40:18] <taplar> ^ wouldn't the retrieval from the db do that?
[18:40:40] <robertmaxrees> because the "right way" to do this is to NOT autorefresh but give the user a button to do it.
[18:40:55] <catbadger> why is that the "right" way?
[18:40:56] <robertmaxrees> and store all that data under a namespace and rerender as necessary.
[18:41:17] <robertmaxrees> because autorefreshing is hard to get right and can be extremely confusing.
[18:41:19] <amigooo> I create an object in PHP of the IDs, about the rows with the IDs and send it via JSON back to the ajax request to JS.
[18:41:24] <robertmaxrees> just fetch the data the current user needs.
[18:41:52] <amigooo> ah it is just refreshing new incoming data, that is nescessary that the users sees it immidiately
[18:41:53] <catbadger> I'd do the refresh on body.mouseover with a timeout so that the scren must be left alone for 3 seconds after mousemove. then you get autorefresh without the high cost
[18:42:06] <robertmaxrees> amigooo why is that so important?
[18:42:23] <catbadger> wonderful question @robertmaxrees
[18:42:26] <taplar> from the looks of the script though, your just using the values of the object
[18:42:36] <taplar> which brings up the question of the response layout
[18:42:41] <amigooo> because the user needs to know when there are updates as soon as possible not, when he is doing any clicks or mouseovers
[18:42:50] <robertmaxrees> amigooo then you don't want ajax here at all.
[18:42:58] <robertmaxrees> is this for like stock trading?
[18:43:05] <amigooo> kinda like that yeah :D
[18:43:09] <amigooo> but the same principe
[18:43:09] <robertmaxrees> then you need websockets.
[18:43:13] <taplar> ^^^
[18:43:14] <catbadger> um... yesh
[18:43:20] <robertmaxrees> ajax is the wrong tool for that job.
[18:43:29] * catbadger nods feverishly
[18:43:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to open a connection and shunt data both ways.
[18:43:38] <taplar> true blue pubsub
[18:43:49] <robertmaxrees> flux would be rad for that, too.
[18:44:17] <catbadger> anyone a jqgrid ninja?
[18:44:26] <amigooo> I don't know any of that tools dudes..
[18:44:33] <robertmaxrees> amigooo then learn :)
[18:44:37] <robertmaxrees> catbeard i've maybe heard of it once or twice.
[18:44:46] <catbadger> lol
[18:45:11] <taplar> knowing certain tools do not make them the correct solution for the job.  websockets are the best solution for this problem
[18:46:27] <taplar> and then once you know it, you're the dude in the office who knows awesome websockets.  bonus!
[18:46:53] <catbadger> I'd do the refresh on body.mouseover with a timeout so that the scren must be left alone for 3 seconds after mousemove. then you get autorefresh without the high cost
[18:46:56] <catbadger> arg
[18:47:05] <catbadger> ok so I have a jqgrid... there are seperate tables for the header rows and the grid itself. when the grid renders in chrome under 1200px wide, the grid headers alignment goes a little wonky. the header columns are ignoring the css set on the html elements.
[18:47:07] <taplar> it's still a high cost
[18:47:12] <taplar> cause your still doing http protocol
[18:47:48] <taplar> websockets knocks out the repeated handshakes and headers
[18:48:08] <robertmaxrees> catbadger you keep repeating that.  literally nobody here can help unless you provide a user-case.
[18:48:10] <robertmaxrees> *use
[18:50:36] <catbadger> yeah
[18:50:37] <catbadger> sorry
[18:50:44] <catbadger> Timetrex
[18:50:54] <catbadger> @amigooo $.post(url,data,function(data){$(document).data = data;});
[18:51:12] <catbadger> @amigooo then access through $(document).data
[18:51:14] <catbadger> ;)
[18:51:17] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[18:51:18] <robertmaxrees> please.
[18:51:19] <catbadger> many name it something better
[18:51:20] <taplar> lol, why the wrap
[18:52:06] <catbadger> don't do what?
[18:52:14] <taplar> what does it get ya?
[18:52:16] <robertmaxrees> use ajax for the application he's using.
[18:52:19] <catbadger> he's just prototyping
[18:52:39] <catbadger> also he seems to be a little on the rushed side for results
[18:52:40] <Darmani> So my search function only works for one call. Since I'm only replacing part of the dom with jquery it doesn't seem to work after that.
[18:52:42] <robertmaxrees> it also doesn't fix the race condition issue he ket noting.
[18:52:42] <taplar> fwiw, $(document).data wouldn't even be global
[18:52:53] <taplar> it would be lost if that var was not stored
[18:52:56] <robertmaxrees> Darmani use a delegated event listener.
[18:52:57] <Darmani> Is there a good way to fix?
[18:53:08] <Darmani> a delegated event listener o.o
[18:53:11] <catbadger> @robertmaxrees i must have missed that part
[18:53:31] <robertmaxrees> Darmani i assume you've got something like .on('submit', function() {})l ?
[18:53:44] <Darmani> that's exactly it lol
[18:53:48] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[18:54:06] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[18:54:16] <Darmani> cooll
[18:54:19] <Darmani> thanks dude
[18:54:39] <taplar> his mind is fixing to explode
[18:54:53] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure i made the exact same suggestion earlier.
[18:54:57] <taplar> yup
[18:55:17] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:55:19] <robertmaxrees> this channel sometimes
[18:55:34] <taplar> can't blame him.  he's having trouble with listeners
[18:55:43] <robertmaxrees> #BOOM
[18:56:01] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, sorry i DC. My new built for my pc isnt going too well
[18:56:08] <ircbaao> keep getting blue screen
[18:56:10] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[18:58:45] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/3hax8aoL/1/ any good?
[18:59:03] <taplar> woah, invalid object
[18:59:08] <taplar> keys are unique
[18:59:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's a busted object yo.
[18:59:25] <robertmaxrees> that's also not an array.
[18:59:39] <ircbaao> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/3hax8aoL/2/
[18:59:48] <robertmaxrees> stioll not valid duder.
[18:59:51] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[19:00:02] <taplar> and not at all an 'array'
[19:00:11] <robertmaxrees> twice.
[19:00:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hkcbon1b/1/
[19:00:50] <robertmaxrees> i think this is what you mean.
[19:00:51] <taplar> ah, missed that
[19:01:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hkcbon1b/2/
[19:02:03] <robertmaxrees> something tells me your sort is wrong.
[19:02:36] <robertmaxrees> unless you mean to sort from largest to smallest.
[19:03:06] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, thanks
[19:03:11] <robertmaxrees> also that map is totally unnecessary.
[19:03:22] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, i want to sort the name it order
[19:03:45] <taplar> by what?  right now your sorting by id
[19:03:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[19:04:09] <ircbaao> alphabetically
[19:04:36] <taplar> i asked this earlier, but maybe your dc'ed
[19:04:44] <taplar> why is your db not sorting it for you before returning?
[19:05:09] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: So this doesn't work https://gist.github.com/mfifth/1d76b6f718e037fd80195b98a6e96621
[19:05:42] <taplar> cause idk how javascript compares strings, but it can be a pita
[19:05:54] <ircbaao> taplar, good idea
[19:06:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah follow taplar's advice.
[19:06:19] <ircbaao> best to do it where i understand
[19:06:22] <taplar> lots of languages factor string length into comparisons, which fubars it
[19:06:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:06:38] <robertmaxrees> and DBs are built for this kidn of stuiff.
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> Darmani ...
[19:06:52] <robertmaxrees> becuase that's not a delegated listener.
[19:06:56] <robertmaxrees> you didn't actually read anything :)
[19:07:27] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: I tried I just didn't get it.
[19:07:34] <robertmaxrees> Darmani show me what you tried then.
[19:07:53] <ircbaao> robertmaxrees, if you type without tagging someones name who are you speaking to?
[19:08:11] <robertmaxrees> contextually i was just speaking to you and then darmani.
[19:08:18] <ircbaao> i also put your name or anyone name so they know i am speaking to them robertmaxrees
[19:08:21] <Darmani> robertmaxrees:what do you mean?
[19:08:33] <robertmaxrees> Darmani show me what you actually tried to do :)
[19:08:47] <robertmaxrees> ircbaao lol thanks for the netiquette lesson ;)
[19:09:05] <Darmani> I added the .on('submit', function() {});
[19:09:07] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/1d76b6f718e037fd80195b98a6e96621
[19:09:13] <robertmaxrees> Darmani that's not a delegated listener.
[19:09:21] <robertmaxrees> if you'd read the documentation, you'd see that's the case.
[19:09:35] * Darmani sighs
[19:09:39] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:09:55] <Darmani> OH wait
[19:09:57] <taplar> the learn version is probably more readable
[19:09:58] <Darmani> hang on.
[19:10:00] <Darmani> let me read this brb.
[19:10:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why i linked both.
[19:10:15] <Yepp> nighty
[19:10:27] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: wait wait but this is for a search feature that I'm building into a website.
[19:10:34] <robertmaxrees> Darmani so?
[19:10:37] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with anything?
[19:11:03] <Darmani> idk.. lol
[19:11:04] <taplar> Darmani: after reading the docs, what is your understanding of what a delegate listener is?
[19:11:26] <robertmaxrees> that statement is predicated on the notion that he read the docs ;)
[19:11:33] <taplar> yup, i'm quizing him, :)
[19:12:03] <Darmani> uhhhh...
[19:12:17] <Darmani> It's for descendant elements right?
[19:12:19] <robertmaxrees> does the word "bubble" mean anything to you w/r/t the DOM
[19:12:44] <taplar> Darmani: elaborate pls
[19:13:20] <Darmani> Like... Applying an event listener to a list of items will include all items that were made and will be made.
[19:13:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:13:36] <Darmani> no idea then.
[19:13:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:13:42] <taplar> wait, unless by list he's talking about a ul
[19:14:01] <taplar> elaborate!
[19:14:01] <robertmaxrees> something tells me he means a selection.
[19:14:04] <taplar> lol
[19:14:21] <ircbaao> taplar and robertmaxrees thanks for your help again much appreciated
[19:14:27] <robertmaxrees> def.
[19:14:31] <taplar> wha'd i do?
[19:14:41] <robertmaxrees> you existed.
[19:14:45] <taplar> i think
[19:14:58] <Darmani> Well you pick an element that is present right now and it will involves all the child elements of it..
[19:15:07] <Darmani> i think.
[19:15:13] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:15:21] <robertmaxrees> but what happens if you delete that element?
[19:15:39] <Darmani> Well you're fucked. That's why you pick one like a container or something right?
[19:15:47] <taplar> cool
[19:15:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:15:55] <taplar> so how does that apply to your situation?
[19:15:55] <Darmani> HA
[19:15:57] <robertmaxrees> a parent that doesn't get replaced/removed.
[19:15:57] <Darmani> I WIN
[19:16:04] <Darmani> taplar: oh I have no idea.
[19:16:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:16:20] <taplar> you just stated the 'issue'
[19:16:27] <Darmani> Oh wait. So I pick the element that holds my search form...?
[19:16:37] <robertmaxrees> $('parent').on('submit', 'theElement', function() {});
[19:16:41] <Darmani> why don't I just pick the fucking .body element and leave it at that?
[19:16:51] <robertmaxrees> because that's inefficient.
[19:16:53] <robertmaxrees> and poorly scoped.
[19:16:59] <Darmani> you're poorly scoed.
[19:17:05] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:17:18] <taplar> every event bubbles though body
[19:17:25] <robertmaxrees> *almost
[19:17:29] <taplar> well yeah
[19:17:52] <taplar> but if the event can only originate from a small section of the page, potentially your filtering way more than you should have to
[19:18:19] <taplar> and if that section gets removed, that handler would still be out there lingering
[19:18:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:18:42] <Darmani> ic
[19:18:44] <robertmaxrees> widgetize it.
[19:19:36] <robertmaxrees> plus it makes troubleshooting things later much easier.
[19:19:40] * taplar tries to remember an old song with linger in it.   an irish group?
[19:20:10] <taplar> oh man, gotta google
[19:20:24] <taplar> haha!
[19:20:50] <taplar> cranberries
[19:21:35] <taplar> man, '93
[19:21:44] <robertmaxrees> oh wow.
[19:23:26] <arc_> how did this song become a single
[19:23:34] <taplar> it's great, that's how
[19:23:38] <taplar> :D
[19:23:55] <taplar> that and zombie
[19:24:01] <taplar> probably the only two i know
[19:24:23] <arc_> this song is extremely boring to me :p
[19:24:34] <arc_> zombie is better
[19:25:42] <robertmaxrees> it was a bit of a reaction to the other bands of the era.
[19:25:57] <robertmaxrees> and to the 80's too.
[19:26:03] <robertmaxrees> people wanted something a little less.... extreme.
[19:26:27] <taplar> heh, going counter to all the songs about death
[19:26:52] <taplar> well, not zombie
[19:27:01] <robertmaxrees> just a bit of a recovery.
[19:27:11] <taplar> i always thought it was more of a political song
[19:28:27] <robertmaxrees> oh i was just speaking generically.
[19:28:34] <taplar> mmm
[19:29:07] <robertmaxrees> you see a weird explosion of artists and genres every 10 years or so.
[19:29:45] <robertmaxrees> usually some kind of reactionary thing.
[19:31:23] <robertmaxrees> hah speaking of throwback artists: fiona apple
[19:32:18] <taplar> hah!
[19:32:28] <robertmaxrees> my band does a cover of criminal.
[19:32:39] <taplar> playing that right now
[19:32:47] <robertmaxrees> it's a great tune
[19:34:29] <taplar> a while back i had blind melon no rain on repeat
[19:34:43] <robertmaxrees> hah we were JUST talking about that song yesterday.
[19:39:28] <Darmani> What the hell
[19:39:50] <Darmani> So I'm trying to make my pagination links ajax but it only works on every other click.
[19:39:51] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/1d76b6f718e037fd80195b98a6e96621
[19:40:04] <Darmani> So the first click I do the page will stay the same, then the next link will make a full reset
[19:40:07] <Darmani> dafuq
[19:40:18] <taplar> so... what happened to the delegate listener idea
[19:40:27] <Darmani> ohhhhh right
[19:40:28] <Darmani> lmao
[19:40:30] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[19:40:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:40:35] <Darmani> shutup
[19:40:36] <Darmani> lol
[19:41:01] <Darmani> no wait.
[19:41:09] <Darmani> That's not the same thing I think.
[19:41:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:41:25] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: why do you hate me qq
[19:41:33] <robertmaxrees> if it only works "every other click", that means that the second click is causing the page to reload, right?
[19:41:44] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: yeah.
[19:41:56] <taplar> we're giving you a hard time, because you've pasted ruffly the same code...... 3+ times
[19:41:57] <robertmaxrees> sooooo does .pagination get replaced?
[19:42:02] <taplar> and not taken our suggestion
[19:42:16] <robertmaxrees> ^ and you're not really getting the bigger picture heh
[19:42:27] <Darmani> This is new to me
[19:42:31] <Darmani> patience is a virtue
[19:42:48] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:42:55] <Darmani> OH shit pagination does get replaced...
[19:42:57] <Darmani> hmm.
[19:42:58] <robertmaxrees> right.
[19:43:02] <robertmaxrees> so what does that tell you?
[19:43:12] <Darmani> that I need to fix my js.
[19:43:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:43:25] <robertmaxrees> that event delegation is the solution here
[19:44:04] <taplar> hah!  rob, remember this one? ;) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI

[19:44:27] <robertmaxrees> oh wow.
[19:44:31] <robertmaxrees> baz luhrmann
[19:44:42] <taplar> i've been trying to remember this one for years
[19:44:45] <robertmaxrees> brb moulin rouge
[19:45:41] <arc_> moulin rouge is one of my favorite movies
[19:45:47] <Darmani> oh my god.
[19:45:48] <Darmani> it works
[19:45:53] <Darmani> I could kiss you guys right now
[19:45:54] <arc_> anyone who doesn't like it needs new opinions
[19:46:03] <Darmani> you guys were right.
[19:46:08] <arc_> they usually are
[19:46:09] <robertmaxrees> could you tell my wife that?
[19:46:11] * taplar gasps
[19:46:13] <Darmani> LOL
[19:46:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:46:21] <Darmani> yeah I'll let her know lol
[19:46:28] <taplar> stalker...
[19:46:51] <Darmani> xD
[19:47:35] <taplar> arc_ was referring to robert.  my accuracy rating is like.... 32%
[19:48:29] <taplar> robert's is like 46%
[19:48:35] <taplar> what can we say, the test is rigged
[19:50:42] * taplar taps the mic
[19:50:48] <robertmaxrees> uh oh
[19:53:33] <taplar> wow, that's kinda funny, wonder if i can find a pic of that
[19:54:06] <taplar> well, maybe not it's a vid.  hey, go to cspan.org and tell me if you see the big pic for the "Senate Hearing Focuses on Online Ticket Sales" vid
[19:54:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah i can.
[19:54:48] <taplar> seriously, look at the name plates.  "Mr. Seller"  "Mr. Liegl"
[19:54:57] <robertmaxrees> hahahahhaa
[19:55:00] <taplar> can't make that stuff up
[19:55:06] <robertparkerx> jQuery("#video_category li input:checked").each() works for checkbox. jQuery("#video_category li input:selected").each() would this work for radio?
[19:55:58] <taplar> i don't think its selected
[19:56:03] <taplar> :checked i think
[19:56:15] <taplar> but that would also get checkboxes
[19:57:29] <robertparkerx> taplar you're right :s
[19:57:34] <robertparkerx> it's still :checked xD
[19:58:33] <taplar> jQuery("#video_category li input").filter(function(){ this.type === "radio" && this.checked === true; });
[19:59:08] <taplar> ha, don't even need the === true part
[19:59:14] <taplar> just && this.checked
[19:59:35] <taplar> or !this.checked, depending on your need
[20:00:07] <taplar> jQuery("#video_category li input").filter(function(){ return this.type === "radio" && this.checked; });
[20:01:06] <Darmani> Alright I want to add search suggestions to my search box.
[20:01:12] <Darmani> Can someone point me in the right direction?
[20:01:14] <robertmaxrees> Darmani use a plugin for it.
[20:01:36] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: really? It's that hard to make?
[20:01:47] <taplar> wheel, chisel, programming
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:01:55] <robertmaxrees> let somebody else handle the grunt work.
[20:02:09] <Darmani> hm okay.
[20:02:10] <robertmaxrees> why solve a problem if somebody else already solved it?
[20:02:13] <Darmani> true true
[20:03:00] <taplar> what kind of search suggestions?
[20:03:20] <Darmani> umm just titles based on what a user types in
[20:03:22] <Darmani> like google.
[20:03:55] <Darmani> I was going to limit the suggestions to 5 though so it wouldn't be that made anyway.
[20:04:16] <taplar> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ one option
[20:04:32] <taplar> you can make it do ajax requests to get the suggestions on the fly
[20:05:37] <Darmani> oh that's awesome.
[20:05:40] <Darmani> yeah something like that.
[20:05:54] <taplar> i guess it could also be referred to as Typeahead
[20:06:13] <taplar> http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/javascript.html#typeahead
[20:06:23] <taplar> various options
[20:53:28] <samsagaz_> hey guys, i cant figure why happend this.. i have an django app that run some jscript (jqwidgets, jquery) everything works OK under windows, but if i visit the pages using linux (firefox, opera, chromium) jscripts wont runs OK, and no errors in Console, After test a lot of things, i found that run firefox in safe mode under linux i get the script working without a problem! someome know how is possible that happend that? is strange that runs OK under wi
[20:53:29] <samsagaz_> n and under linux no :(
[20:53:54] <robertmaxrees> show us the code duder.
[20:54:10] <robertmaxrees> wait - it works in safe mode on linux?
[20:54:16] <samsagaz_> yes
[20:54:26] <robertmaxrees> then you have a plugin causing problems.
[20:54:31] <robertmaxrees> or your install is totally holsed.
[20:54:33] <robertmaxrees> *hosed
[20:55:10] <samsagaz_> mmm but installed opera, midori and wont works either
[20:55:19] <robertmaxrees> then i'd have to see the code.
[20:55:34] <samsagaz_> tried to paste the code in fiddle but cant get it working...
[20:55:36] <samsagaz_> will try again
[20:55:45] <robertmaxrees> at least let me see it then.
[20:55:46] <samsagaz_> have a lot of code /
[20:57:49] <samsagaz_> http://190.18.95.126:8000/products/related/
[20:57:56] <robertmaxrees> in a fiddle please.
[20:58:06] <samsagaz_> ok
[20:58:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't wnat the entire page fwiw.
[20:58:20] <robertmaxrees> just the bit that's broken.
[20:58:23] <robertmaxrees> reduce it down.
