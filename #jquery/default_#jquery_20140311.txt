[00:05:18] <velus> the jquery is at the bottom
[00:06:16] <velus> should i put it in a script and dorp it at the bottom of the page?
[00:07:34] <_cristian_> velus you should put jquery at the top
[00:08:16] <velus> i have always been told to have it at the bottom
[00:08:54] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm having some trouble with some json... My ajax call is returning this {"status":200,"check":false} but I keep getting Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o
[00:09:14] <_cristian_> velus nope, jquery goes at the bottom, and if you have a personal script maybe it could be at the bottom. But jquery always goes top.
[00:12:32] <Uhkis> _cristian_: some mixed messages there :)
[00:14:28] <_cristian_> Uhkis You talk about what I said of top and bottom ? I just say that if you make some $.ajax() or any kind of simple script it could be at bottom, but generally it goes on top cause it loads first
[00:15:34] <Uhkis> _cristian_: "jquery goes at the bottom" .... "jquery always goes top"
[00:16:38] <_cristian_> Uhkis Ohh you're right!, I wanted to say "jquery goes at the top ... jquery always goes top" , my mistake
[00:16:48] <velus> if i take out (jquery) it seems to no show any errors
[00:17:00] <_cristian_> I'm not english native, sometimes I mix the words lol
[00:17:04] <Uhkis> :)
[00:17:09] <_cristian_> ;)
[00:18:02] <murosai> what's the path where jquery-ui searches for image resources?
[00:20:03] <velus> ok i have jquery at the top and have it back inline but there is no error excetption yet all i get is a simple nothing when submit is clicked
[00:20:08] <Jattenalle> murosai, it's in the .css
[00:20:24] <Jattenalle> murosai, for whatever jquery ui theme you've grabbed
[00:20:54] <ekcktroij> How would you find all children of an element with an index smaller than x?
[00:23:40] <jop008> Gm here can you trap the enter on an input field?
[00:24:07] <jop008> input text field when the user hits enter some things must be done
[00:25:03] <Uhkis> jop008: $(yourfield).on('focus', function() { handlekeypress here } or something like that
[00:25:32] <jop008> is this crossbrowser?
[00:26:02] <Uhkis> iirc safari had some weirdness with those focus/blur etc events
[00:27:15] <velus> Uhkis: could it be cos the name of the button is login not submit?
[00:29:44] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm having trouble parsing this into an object. Any help would be greatly appreciated: console.log( $.parseJSON({"status":"200","check":"false"}) );
[00:30:12] <Cork> checkit: it is already an object
[00:30:38] <Cork> $.parseJSON('{"status":"200","check":"false"}') should work
[00:33:49] <murosai> Jattenalle: are the css and js files somehow related? can i use newest version of js and a really old css file?
[00:34:11] <Jattenalle> uhm, im not sure
[00:34:20] <Jattenalle> and not they're not directly related
[00:34:34] <Cork> your talking about jquery ui css?
[00:34:35] <Jattenalle> JS is for all the things that happen, css is for how things look
[00:35:10] <Jattenalle> Cork, [08:18:04] <murosai> what's the path where jquery-ui searches for image resources?
[00:35:16] <Cork> ok
[00:35:23] <Jattenalle> told him it's in the css, that's as far as we've gotten :)
[00:35:25] <Cork> you can most of the time use old css files
[00:35:32] <checkit> Cork: Maybe this might help elaborate on what I'm trying to do... resp in the following paste represents the response from servers side script. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9481177
[00:35:43] <Cork> except for new features
[00:35:56] <Cork> and sometimes you can have problems with changes in the structure
[00:36:12] <Cork> but most of the time it works fine for plugins that exist in both versions
[00:36:41] <Cork> checkit: fix the server and you won't need to do that
[00:37:03] <Cork> checkit: the server should set Content-Type: application/json
[00:37:08] <Cork> when it sends json responses
[00:37:13] <murosai> well i updated my jquery-ui js file but seems like the images don't work anymore
[00:38:29] <Cork> checkit: if the server doesn't lie about what content it sends resp should already be parsed
[00:39:04] <checkit> Cork: Right right... I'm echoe'ing back instead of sending it with the appropriate content type....
[00:39:04] <Cork> checkit: depending on the server you might need to set dataType: 'json',
[00:39:06] <murosai> so the .css file tells where the images are loaded?
[00:39:18] <Cork> checkit: php?
[00:40:24] <checkit> Cork: Yup
[00:40:52] <checkit> Cork: Laravel framework specifically.
[00:42:49] <Cork> checkit: try header('Content-Type: application/json'
[00:42:51] <Cork> );
[00:43:00] <Cork> checkit: before you echo anything from the script
[00:44:47] <checkit> Cork: Thanks. I'll take that route.

[00:55:27] <Prasanth88> Hello everyone
[00:55:33] <Prasanth88> I'm trying to achieve a stall selection mechanism using table grid for this layout http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=49dd30d
[00:56:02] <Prasanth88> can anyone suggest how to perform the selection mechanism? i decided to give ids for each td with numbers and make the selection, but which is best way to achieve multiple selection also and the selected values will be passed in the asp.net framework
[00:57:00] <Prasanth88> can i use asp.net checkbox mechanism or is it easy to use jquery?
[01:01:30] <pingec> Can I change the content of a <style> element?
[01:05:38] <Cork> pingec: yes
[01:05:48] <Cork> you can either handle it as text
[01:05:59] <Cork> or you can modify it in document.styleSheets
[01:11:10] <tudda> #csharp
[01:11:21] <tudda> woops
[01:19:35] <AdmireNL> i'm getting a error: Object [object HTMLAnchorElement] has no method 'attr'
[01:20:30] <Vorisi> AdmireNL, how are you referencing the element?
[01:20:44] <AdmireNL> / scrollToMy element
[01:20:44] <AdmireNL> 	$.fn.scrollToMy = function() {
[01:20:46] <AdmireNL> 		return this.each(function () {
[01:20:47] <AdmireNL> 			var that = $(this);
[01:20:49] <AdmireNL> 			that.on('click', 'a', function(event) {
[01:20:50] <AdmireNL> 				event.preventDefault();
[01:20:52] <AdmireNL> 				console.log(this);
[01:20:53] <AdmireNL> 				var headerHeight = $('#header').outerHeight(),
[01:20:53] <AdmireNL> 	    			target = this.attr('href'),
[01:20:54] <AdmireNL> it's about the target var
[01:21:05] <Vorisi> use $(this).attr
[01:21:59] <Cork> AdmireNL: also please don't dump code in the channel
[01:22:10] <AdmireNL> but the console gives back the object when I log (this)
[01:22:39] <Cork> AdmireNL: this in the code is the dom element $() wrapps it in a jquery object
[01:22:57] <Cork> and you need to jquery object to call jquery functions on the element
[01:23:17] <AdmireNL> Thanks Vorisi and Cork
[01:38:32] <Mothership> oi
[01:38:45] <jop008> after html insert how to force rendering?
[01:44:47] <Cork> jop008: force?
[01:45:06] <Cork> if you've added it to the dom it renders
[01:45:09] <jop008> trigger "create"
[01:45:28] <Cork> hmm jqm?
[01:45:47] <Cork> (cause that is the only env i can think of that would need it)
[01:46:16] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to do a for each for each class starting with width-
[01:46:18] <sunbeam> then for each i'd like to check the value after width (if its more than 0)
[01:46:21] <sunbeam> how can I best do that?
[01:46:32] <Cork> sunbeam: you shouldn't do that
[01:46:41] <Cork> split the class up into classes instead
[01:46:57] <Cork> <elm class="width-something"> becomes <elm class="width something">
[01:47:24] <seutje> well, in his case, he's using a number
[01:47:26] <Cork> sunbeam: the dom doesn't provide a way to do performant sub class name selections
[01:47:45] <Cork> then it shouldn't be in the classname to begin with
[01:48:03] <Cork> <elm class="width" data-width="50">
[01:48:21] <Cork> or possibly <elm class="width width-50">
[01:48:30] <seutje> ew :P
[01:48:54] <Cork> either way you can't do partial class name selections
[01:49:05] <Cork> you have to loop the element and do string comparison
[01:49:12] <Cork> so you can't get performance from it
[01:51:12] <sunbeam> Cork: i know, but this is for a CMS
[01:51:17] <sunbeam> no other way to do this at this moment
[01:51:21] <Cork> ugg
[01:51:24] <sunbeam> I mean I know that it's a bad practice
[01:51:29] <sunbeam> to define width styles like this
[01:52:25] <Cork> something like $('*').filter(function() { return /width-/.test(elm.className); }) then
[01:52:28] <sunbeam> i just need a way to find which elements have a class that start with width-
[01:52:30] <seutje> you could $('*').filter but that's just gross
[01:52:36] <Cork> ya
[01:52:49] <seutje> ur basically looping over *all* elements
[01:52:57] <Prasanth88> any suggestion to my booking system?
[01:53:00] <Cork> not basically
[01:53:04] <sunbeam> seutje: i just want to loop over all elements that are class .column
[01:53:04] <Cork> that is exactly what you do
[01:53:06] <seutje> literally :P
[01:53:10] <sunbeam> no need to loop over all
[01:53:19] <seutje> that word had become rather unpopular though
[01:53:20] <Cork> sunbeam: $('.column').filter(function() { return /width-/.test(elm.className); })
[01:53:25] <sunbeam> thanks
[01:53:26] <sunbeam> sec
[01:53:46] <seutje> sunbeam: that's what cork meant by using class="width width-x"
[01:53:57] <seutje> "column width-x" works as well
[01:53:59] <sunbeam> ah yep
[01:54:01] <sunbeam> ok
[01:54:07] <Cork> well actually i didn't
[01:54:15] <Cork> i meant you could filter on the class only
[01:54:20] <Cork> sunbeam: $('.column.width')
[01:54:31] <Cork> if you had that class that is
[01:54:35] <seutje> I'm assuming only the columns have the width-x class
[01:54:48] <Cork> but i suspect some of them don't have width-
[01:55:31] <Cork> i just wish cms wasn't so horribly bad at thinking about front end
[01:55:42] <Cork> they optimize for css at best
[01:56:01] <Cork> if you need to target things well your problem loop away
[01:56:10] <seutje> should check out the markup drupal 8 spits out... pretty minimal
[01:56:17] * Cork remembers the horror from when he had to use cms
[01:56:37] <Cork> seutje: you mean it worse then it used to be?
[01:56:56] <Prasanth88> i'm typing my scenario again - I'm trying to achieve a stall selection mechanism using table grid for this layout http://www.tiikoni.com/tis/view/?id=49dd30d
[01:57:10] <Cork> seutje: cause drupal used to be as extendable as a brick
[01:57:16] <seutje> used to be all class="block block-system block-system-foo block-system-foo-x block-region-y block-region-y-system-foo-x"
[01:57:31] <Cork> seutje: you could bolt things on, but if you ever needed to touch something deeper, then your in a heap of problem
[01:57:47] <Cork> seutje: ya i know
[01:58:06] <Cork> i did quite a bit of drupal back in 4 - 6
[01:58:08] <seutje> usually I only experience problems overriding shit when it's contrib modules that didn't use the APIs
[01:58:17] <seutje> then I just fork the module
[01:58:21] <seutje> pretty much
[01:58:50] <seutje> getting them to accept the changes within the deadline of the project I need it for is usually a bit unrealistic
[01:59:43] <seutje> Prasanth88: I've seen a few of those done with D3
[01:59:55] <Cork> ya, especially as accepting patches used to take ~ 1-2 years
[02:00:05] <seutje> can't say I've had to create a similar system though
[02:00:08] <Cork> i had a patch i provided to the search feature
[02:00:21] <Cork> the bug was found in 4, patch was written in 5 rc
[02:00:35] <Cork> and the bug was resolved as won't fix in late 6 >_<
[02:00:40] <Cork> so they never fixed the bug
[02:00:43] <seutje> Cork: depends what ur patching, contrib depends heavily on the maintainer, core depends on how opinionized it is :P
[02:01:11] <Cork> seutje: the bug was that if a node was ever updated it caused the indexer to skip more or less the entire page
[02:01:15] <Cork> *site
[02:01:38] <Cork> the fix was just so it made sure it didn't ignore pages that was never searched
[02:01:51] <Cork> the patch was two lines
[02:01:58] <seutje> haha
[02:02:05] <Cork> but was ignored until the entire search feature was rewritten in 6
[02:02:10] <Cork> then they just throw it away
[02:02:10] <seutje> now I know why our backenders never wanna use core search
[02:02:19] <seutje> yeah, that's so annoying
[02:02:29] <seutje> I have dozens of patches rotting in an issue somewhere
[02:02:33] <Cork> so we had to keep patching every release...
[02:02:48] <seutje> jenkins does that :P
[02:02:53] <Cork> made me really lose all fate in drupal
[02:03:05] <Cork> luckely i don't have to touch it much now days
[02:03:32] <seutje> I don't mind it all that much, even if there's lots of php bits to it
[02:03:57] <Cork> i made one site that needed to extend the menu
[02:04:07] <Prasanth88> can anyone suggest how to perform the selection mechanism? i decided to give ids for each td with numbers and make the selection, but which is best way to achieve multiple selection also and the selected values will be passed in the asp.net framework
[02:04:16] <Cork> after about a week of development i had more or less forked half the core >_<
[02:04:29] <seutje> like add menu items?
[02:04:30] <Cork> cause there where no hooks what so ever to extend parts there
[02:04:43] <Cork> seutje: they wanted multiple menu entries for the same page
[02:05:34] <seutje> hmm, it was prolly different in 4, which was before my time, but I remember doing that in 5 relatively easily
[02:05:50] <Prasanth88> seutje: that's good. but i'm looking for add to cart like system using jquery or if possible in asp.net itself. i'm sure jquery is easy in making multiple selection and all
[02:06:01] <Cork> seutje: the problems i had wasn't fixed until 6
[02:06:20] <Cork> seutje: when they completely rewrite the menu system
[02:06:26] <Cork> *rewrote
[02:06:48] <seutje> haven't done backendy stuff in ages tbh
[02:07:04] <Cork> Prasanth88: you might want to have a look at selectable in jquery ui
[02:07:11] <Cork> and possibly draggabble
[02:07:45] <Petazz> Hi! I'm trying to use jquery plugin jeditable but when the edit box opens it displays [object Object], why?
[02:07:49] <Cork> seutje: about half a year after 6 was released we stopped doing consulting work and now i code for the companys own need instead
[02:08:10] <Cork> seutje: so barely any php (only for the normal front page)
[02:09:32] <ekcktroij> How do you check if 1 or more of elements with a certain class is visible? So should return true if 1 or more are visible and false of none are visible.
[02:09:51] <Cork> ekcktroij: what do you mean by visible?
[02:09:57] <seutje> Cork: for this one project, I have to override pretty much all the markup though
[02:10:07] <Cork> ekcktroij: not display: none; or actually visible on the screen?
[02:10:11] <ekcktroij> like in the oppositie of display:none
[02:10:18] <Cork> ok that is simple
[02:10:19] <seutje> have to match the templates written by a guy who does nothing but markup full-time
[02:10:29] <Cork> $('.the-class').is(':visible')
[02:10:34] <seutje> they're a bit... granular
[02:10:44] <ekcktroij> oh that returns true or false?
[02:10:50] <Cork> ekcktroij: yes
[02:10:54] <ekcktroij> kewl
[02:12:54] <ekcktroij> When I do if ((".idea-menu").is(":visible")) { } it says "is" is not a function
[02:13:26] <Cork> you missed the $
[02:13:58] <ekcktroij> oop
[02:14:04] <ekcktroij> yes it works now!
[02:19:39] <Guest25187> hi there, currently having trouble with unwanted repetition with nested functions for draggable/sortable?
[02:24:36] <Cork> Guest25187: might want to use named functions and pass them to the plugin instead
[02:24:52] <Guest25187> thanks!
[02:27:15] <Guest25187> currently using livequery to call the function when it's loaded, that isn't working
[02:27:20] <Guest25187> i.e., it's still repeating
[02:28:49] <Cork> Guest25187: uh, what do you mean by repeating?
[02:29:21] <Guest25187> it's a playlist function
[02:29:27] <Guest25187> where you drag and drop and sort videos
[02:29:44] <Guest25187> and there's a "history" function which saves what you've seen/listened to
[02:29:59] <Guest25187> the code currently repeats the history entry
[02:30:52] <Guest25187> so if it's the 3rd video in the list, it is saved around 3 times (may increase with sorting)
[02:31:09] <Guest25187> thought it was because the function was nested within draggable/sortable, so i took it out and put it in a livequery function
[02:31:11] <Cork> sounds like you might be adding the event listeners multiple times
[02:31:27] <Cork> Guest25187: side note, you don't need livequery most of the time
[02:31:43] <Cork> if you use delegated event listeners for the events it should work fine
[02:31:57] <Guest25187> well the function wasnt working when it wasnt nested within draggable/sortable, which is why i thought about livequery
[02:32:29] <Cork> and as livequery likely works with setInterval i wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole...
[02:32:39] <Cork> (as there really isn't another way it could work)
[02:32:51] <Guest25187> someone sent me this link, do you know of any other delegated event listener tutorials, having trouble understanding this one: http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[02:33:18] <Cork> that is for raw js
[02:33:27] <Cork> it is built into jquery so it is much simpler there
[02:33:30] <Cork> ?api delegate
[02:33:30] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[02:33:39] <Cork> also have a look at on
[02:33:41] <Cork> ?api on
[02:33:41] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:34:12] <Guest25187> I was using on.("click) before this, but it still only worked while nested in sortable
[02:34:25] <Cork> again read the docs
[02:34:43] <Cork> on('click', fn) isn't the same as delegated event listener
[02:35:00] <Guest25187> so i should call on('event')?
[02:36:16] <Cork> no you should start by reading .delegate documentation
[02:36:24] <Cork> and then read the documentation on .on
[02:36:30] <Cork> as it has a delegate syntax
[02:36:36] <Cork> but not all calls to on is delegated
[02:38:41] <Prasanth88> Cork: Thanks
[02:38:48] <Guest25187> cool, thanks
[02:44:43] <velus>  hello all i have a script and well got the pai system fully working now for the data base and responce back in json correct but i cant seem to get the script to reload the whole page for some reason? or get the errors to show red writing in a box? can someone help me the script is here  http://jsfiddle.net/6Cr2v/4/
[02:45:53] <IamTrying> How do you detect if you are in INTERNET or NOT for cross browsers (Google Canary, Opera, Firefox, Android tablet/smartphone)? (by using low bandwidth, we cant just keep doing Ajax or WebSocket to increase bandwidth costs)
[02:46:21] <IamTrying> Detect constant INTERNET is alive or not.
[02:47:09] <Cork> IamTrying: i think they expose some of it for trusted code in navigator
[02:47:19] <Guest25187> .delegate seems to be working, thanks Cork, will translate to on now
[02:47:44] <Cork> velus: you should have preventDefault first in the event handler
[02:47:57] <IamTrying> Cork,  For multi-media live INTERNET accessibility needs to be checked like Google Gmail and Google Hangout (real-time they check and know if internet is available in the PC/Tablet/Smartphone  or not)
[02:48:03] <Cork> velus: also check what data you have in the data variable
[02:48:25] <velus> how do i do that?
[02:48:27] <IamTrying> Cork, did Gmail used Ajax or WebSocket (that is expensive in terms of bandwidth)
[02:48:48] <velus> and where exactly do i put the prevent defualt?
[02:48:51] <Cork> IamTrying: for normal plain sites, the connection type isn't exposed
[02:49:00] <Cork> velus: line 11
[02:49:07] <Cork> the first thing in the event handler
[02:49:36] <velus> and how do i check the data in callback?
[02:49:38] <IamTrying> Cork, my application is Google Hangout like, where i need to know live INTERNET status in the Tablet/Smartphone or PC
[02:50:21] <velus> in chrome developer i have network up and i can see the resonce
[02:50:24] <IamTrying> is there any better/safer/smart/ best way (but not making bandwidth cost)?
[02:50:32] <Cork> velus: console.log(data)
[02:50:50] <Cork> IamTrying: again, you can't from normal web sites
[02:50:58] <jarco> Hello,
[02:51:09] <Cork> if you run as trusted code the navigator object exposes it
[02:51:18] <velus> i dont see anything in the consle.log
[02:51:23] <jarco> how would I count the height of some Li elements untill some height is reached? I guess each wont help me here?
[02:51:43] <Cork> velus: sounds like your post request results in a none 2xx response
[02:52:00] <Cork> jarco: what are you trying to do?
[02:52:37] <IamTrying> OK - Thank you Cork
[02:52:50] <velus> i have a 200 ok in the headers
[02:53:06] <Cork> velus: bind a .fail(function() {}) on the post
[02:53:13] <Cork> so you can know if something fails
[02:53:30] <jarco> Cork, I am trying to get the combined height of li items untill a certain height is found.
[02:53:30] <velus> how i dont really code in js i do mainly php
[02:54:11] <Cork> jarco: are you trying to figure out how many elements you can fit into an area or what?
[02:54:28] <Cork> ?api fail
[02:54:28] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:54:36] <Cork> ?api Deferered.fail
[02:54:36] <jarco> Cork exactly. Its a scroller. I dont want it to cut Li elements in half :)
[02:54:36] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[02:54:59] <Cork> jarco: so grab an element around where you most likely hit the area
[02:55:04] <IamTrying> Cork, is it compatible in all browsers? document.body.addEventListener("offline", function(e){alert("User went offline")}, false)  ? (not import Safari, IE they are suspended)
[02:55:11] <Cork> jarco: check position().top + .height()
[02:55:17] <Cork> if it is too height go backwards
[02:55:24] <Cork> if it is too small go up one
[02:55:46] <Cork> IamTrying: that only shows if the browser is in offline mode
[02:56:01] <jarco> Cork thx, I will try your suggestion
[02:56:27] <Cork> IamTrying: not if the connection is costly
[02:56:47] <Cork> IamTrying: meaning it won't show the difference between wifi or modem connection
[02:56:49] <IamTrying> Cork, so it means Navigator Object do not expose more then that?
[02:57:05] <IamTrying> Cork, then i have to depend on WebSocket or Ajax only?
[02:57:17] <Cork> IamTrying: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/WiFi_Information
[02:57:29] <Cork> again this doesn't work if you arn't running in trusted code
[02:57:57] <Cork> IamTrying: i don't even see how websocket can tell you if the connection is costly
[02:58:15] <Cork> IamTrying: all you can get from there is ip and response time
[02:59:05] <IamTrying> Cork, this is good can live with it. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/WiFi_Information - This is only FIREFOX compatible, but not gonna work in Opera, Canary?
[02:59:57] <Cork> IamTrying: it isn't firefox compatible, it is html app compatible
[03:00:15] <Cork> meaning you can use it in code that are certified
[03:00:29] <Cork> i think chrome os and firefox os supports it
[03:00:33] <IamTrying> Cork, its hard to sue it in Node-webkit only i want to run it over HTTPS/SSL
[03:00:37] <Cork> i don't think it is supported on any browser
[03:00:55] <IamTrying> Cork, OK - then best to use WebSocket and Ajax like Google Gmail did
[03:00:57] <Cork> IamTrying: ssl isn't certified
[03:01:05] <Cork> by certified i mean code signed
[03:01:24] <IamTrying> Cork, OK - ic then its pointless and lengthy process, to make life harder
[03:01:28] <Cork> IamTrying: wifi information can tell a lot about the user/device
[03:01:36] <Cork> so it won't ever be available to the open web
[03:02:09] <IamTrying> Cork, all i need to check if the user is having INTERNET or not say for example if you are in a Airport i want to check your tablet or smartphone has live internet available or not
[03:02:41] <IamTrying> If the internet is available it will automatically do some tasks. So in that case i think i have to go with Websocket ..
[03:02:43] <IamTrying> Thank you
[03:03:02] <Cork> IamTrying: the problem is if you want to identify if the connection will trigger a data connection over gsm/similar
[03:03:10] <Cork> IamTrying: cause as far as i know you can't
[03:03:26] <Cork> if the user put the user in offline mode navigator.offline WILL work for you
[03:03:42] <Cork> but it won't identify if the user is on ex. 3g or similar
[03:05:46] <velus> cork its not the fail that im worried abouut right now its the when someone is logged in it dont refresh the page at all
[03:05:59] <IamTrying> Cork, i have TURN-server running on TCP 80 port, i want to constantly exchange acknowledgment packets once internet was browsed for the first time. If the Internet drops, then it constantly send request on port 80 and wait for reply if no reply means 3G, Wifi, 4G is dead
[03:06:35] <Cork> IamTrying: or just a spotty connection
[03:07:00] <Cork> velus: well right now you don't even know if it fails
[03:07:11] <velus> if what fails?
[03:07:13] <Cork> velus: so the reason your code doesn't work is cause the fail handler is called
[03:07:20] <Cork> something about the ajax call you make
[03:07:33] <Cork> you just throw out a connection and assume it works
[03:07:41] <Cork> if it doesn't you arn't the wiser
[03:07:54] <Cork> that is why i said you should attach a fail handler
[03:08:03] <Cork> so you can test if that is why your code isn't working
[03:08:27] <IamTrying> Thank you Cork, so spotty connection..
[03:08:30] <velus> the script does send the data to the api system and it gets a response back sucess: true wich i set, if i refresh the page the sessions does show but the script dosent refresh the page automatically
[03:08:46] <velus> and i asked where do i attach it and how
[03:09:03] <Cork> velus: but you don't know if you handler is called
[03:09:13] <Cork> as it might be ex. the parser of the server message fails
[03:09:23] <Cork> but as you arn't even looking i can only guess
[03:09:31] <velus> so how do i put in the .fail then where and how
[03:09:59] <Cork> just chain it after $.post()
[03:11:44] <velus> so i just put .fail(); after the post closes?
[03:14:44] <mariuscc> is there any way to zoom out desktop browser when resoltion > 1024 ? viewport scaling does not seam to work
[03:15:09] <murosai> how can i ensure a dialog is displayed on top of everything else in jquery-ui 1.11?
[03:15:19] <murosai> 1.10
[03:16:07] <velus> ok cork i put $.post(.....).fail(); in it and i get this responcse has no data
[03:16:22] <velus> soory this request has no response data
[03:17:28] <Cork> velus: check the second argument to the function
[03:17:36] <velus> ??
[03:17:50] <Cork> function(jqXHR, status, error) {}
[03:18:01] <Cork> if fail is fired it means something fails
[03:18:08] <Cork> status will tell in text
[03:20:22] <velus> {"sucess":true} that is what i get
[03:21:44] <Cork> in the status text?
[03:21:48] <Cork> on fail?
[03:22:07] <velus> now its {"sucess":true} and status code is 200 ok
[03:22:16] <Cork> uh..
[03:22:18] <velus> i get that in the response file
[03:22:18] <Cork> not likely no
[03:22:42] <Cork> velus: do you you have a link where one can look at this?
[03:22:55] <velus> like what sort of link?
[03:23:15] * Cork gives up
[03:23:21] <velus> if you mean a web address then http:velusuniverse.com
[03:25:16] <bgsmith> _cristian_: thanks for the help! It works.
[03:26:06] <IamTrying> Cork, its not working it connects but how do you send the Ping? http://jsfiddle.net/mt95C/
[03:26:31] <Cork> IamTrying: you can't
[03:26:47] <Cork> IamTrying: if the connection drops the connection errors out
[03:26:58] <IamTrying> OK
[03:27:27] <velus> cork this is the header section on the developer http://i58.tinypic.com/2lsfeig.png
[03:27:29] <IamTrying> Cork, i cant do for ( ;  ; ) { new WebSocket() ; } ? like infinite time?
[03:27:32] <Cork> IamTrying: an annoying part you most likely is going to see, is that firefox spams it's console when websocket connection fails
[03:27:50] <Cork> IamTrying: no cause that wouldn't get you if the connection succeeded
[03:28:09] <Cork> IamTrying: and also you need to wait between retries
[03:28:35] <IamTrying> Cork, That is the problem i want to simulate this $ ping -f remoteIP -c 500000000
[03:28:41] <velus> and this is the responce in chrome developer
[03:28:42] <velus> http://i61.tinypic.com/izni3s.png
[03:28:59] <Cork> IamTrying: well you can't really do that
[03:29:19] <IamTrying> WebSocket just a name - good for nothing yet then - Cork
[03:29:37] <Cork> IamTrying: it is a really nice protocol to send data to and from a server
[03:29:43] <Cork> it isn't a raw socket though
[03:29:50] <Cork> as that would be unsafe
[03:31:03] <IamTrying> Safe/Unsafe should be Government issue. But as a developers we need flexibility available/open. if someone feels unsafe he /she can always wear safety belt in browser. i think WebSocket should ignore safe/unsafe but make it available as RAW socket. Cork
[03:31:12] <murosai>  Similar to the stack option, the zIndex option is unnecessary with a proper stacking implementation.
[03:31:14] <Cork> IamTrying: no
[03:31:27] <murosai> this is what it says in jquery-ui site, what does proper stacking implementation mean?
[03:31:28] <IamTrying> Software development is all about how friendly we develop something which can make life easier.
[03:31:30] <Cork> IamTrying: safe as in roge sites can grab sensitive info from the user
[03:31:38] <test> test
[03:31:41] <velus> Cork: can you help me please
[03:31:59] <velus> cork this is the header section on the developer http://i58.tinypic.com/2lsfeig.png and the responce section http://i61.tinypic.com/izni3s.png
[03:31:59] <Cork> velus: i need to drag every little scrap of info out of you so it takes too much time
[03:32:04] <IamTrying> Cork, But that safety can be given to end-user neck why as developer we have to live in a world with restrictions always.
[03:32:22] <seutje> heh, having gov in charge of web security seems like a terrible idea
[03:32:44] <IamTrying> Cork, i completely do not agree websocket should be restricted just because its safe and unsafe. It has to be users decision how much safe/protection he wants.
[03:32:46] <Cork> IamTrying: the browser has to always think of the user first
[03:33:06] <velus> well Cork im sorry if i dont understand what you was saying
[03:33:08] <Cork> else noone could use the web cause sites would steal your login credentials, scan your local network
[03:33:10] <Cork> and what not
[03:33:19] <IamTrying> Cork, if a girl say "i can sex with her without protection" its that girls own choice. Same thing is with WebSocket protection or not its end users choice.
[03:33:21] <velus> and when you ask for a link? a link could be to anything
[03:33:34] <Cork> uh...
[03:33:39] <seutje> "can't use a fridge to flash-freeze human corpses, refrigerator - only a name good for nothing yet I suppose"
[03:34:02] <Cork> IamTrying: so you mean it should be a popup "Do you want enable websocket for this site you know nothing about?"
[03:34:14] <Cork> and if you say no the site says "please enable websocket"
[03:34:18] <opk> test
[03:34:20] <Cork> where is the security in that
[03:34:55] <IamTrying> Cork, Exactly, users can setup saying i trust fully www.cork.com and www.iamtrying.com once they do that. we use webSocket RAW, user is happy and we are happy. if someone to not turst us they can setup there own PROTECTIONS
[03:34:56] <Cork> except if you expect every visitor to first read through all the minified js before letting the site run
[03:35:20] <Guest52865> ok
[03:35:28] <Guest52865> ok
[03:35:35] <Cork> Guest52865: stop that
[03:35:46] <IamTrying> I think WebSocket and HTML5 team should get more into "screw safety" that is making life uneasy for ages. Safety is completely users choice. Anyway thank you very much Cork
[03:35:50] <Cork> IamTrying: from experience through plenty of environments, it is  clear that the world doesn't work like that
[03:35:50] <seutje> haha, cause users are known to read shit before clicking accept, right?
[03:36:02] <Cork> IamTrying: what the user sees is "where do i need to click to get it to work"
[03:36:03] <Guest52865> well
[03:36:08] <Cork> meaning the dialog is pointless
[03:36:34] <Guest52865> anywhere
[03:36:35] <IamTrying> Cork, EXACTLY - "what the user sees is "where do i need to click to get it to work" this is a million dollars statement. SCREW the SAFETY
[03:36:37] <Cork> or it is only useful to developers that can evaluate the security of the site
[03:36:48] <Cork> ...
[03:37:02] <Cork> IamTrying: i guess you haven't looked at social enginering bugs for browsers?
[03:37:04] <velus> seutje: can you help me with this script i have please, http://jsfiddle.net/6Cr2v/5/ this is what i have when i send data to the api via the post it does process it properly, but it is not reloading the page for me. this is the chrome developer information this is the header section on the developer http://i58.tinypic.com/2lsfeig.png and the responce section http://i61.tinypic.com/izni3s.png
[03:37:46] <Guest52865> takk
[03:38:26] <seutje> whoa, busting out the caps, this person must have a valid point now!
[03:38:48] <Guest52865> ok
[03:39:15] <Cork> why do ppl keep testing in real channels...
[03:39:40] <seutje> velus: can't see response header mime type, is it set to json?
[03:39:57] <seutje> tbh, I never use $.post()
[03:40:13] <velus> where would that be?
[03:40:49] <seutje> why do you .fail() if you don't pass a handler?
[03:41:09] <seutje> also, ur not passing a handler to success()
[03:41:15] <seutje> ur passing the result of window.reload()
[03:41:19] <seutje> which is... NULL?
[03:41:28] <velus> i am only doing what cork told me to put when i was asking for help
[03:41:44] <Cork> sigh no you arn't
[03:41:49] <Cork> you skip half of it
[03:41:50] <seutje> no wait, that's a typeerror lol
[03:41:52] <velus> yes i fucki8ng ma
[03:42:04] <velus> i put everything exactly where you told me to cork
[03:42:18] <velus> i didnt skip half of it
[03:42:29] <Cork> velus: i expect you to be able to add 2 and 2
[03:42:31] <velus> you would hardly tell me what to do i jept askign wher to put things
[03:42:34] <seutje> well, it's window.location.reload
[03:42:48] <seutje> and either u don't execute it and pass the function, or wrap it in one
[03:42:55] <seutje> but this will pass undefined at most
[03:42:56] <Cork> "<Cork> velus: bind a .fail(function() {}) on the post"
[03:43:19] <velus> and i went how do you do that but you ignored me
[03:43:23] <Cork> and then i said just chain it after the $.post()
[03:43:43] <Cork> velus: ya, cause every tiny fragment of info has to be dragged out of you
[03:43:54] <seutje> wonder if it matters if u pass an object to window.location.reload... prolly not tho
[03:44:08] <Cork> just cause someone is helping you doesn't mean you should stop thinking
[03:44:17] <seutje> $(function ($) { <- wat?
[03:45:30] <seutje> $(function(lol) { lol('.something').doSomething();  }) actually works, never realized
[03:45:59] <Cork> seutje: it's there to support jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) {})
[03:46:09] <velus> anyway seutje, im basically wanting to be able to post username and password to the file login.php and it wil reply with a json reponse of either sucess: true or faild: error message. if success then reload the page if faild well higlight the login section and also send a mesasage but for now i need to focus on the reloading the page if its a success
[03:53:35] <velus> could you help me seutje
[03:54:22] <DRSK> Anyone able to help me figure out how to "toggle" between two classes and in turn base this toggle on transitionEnd? ---> http://jsfiddle.net/KxgRL/
[03:54:43] <seutje> weird, I remember posting that yesterday o.O
[03:54:52] <velus> posting what?
[03:55:05] <seutje> Cork: why wouldn't u just (function($) {})(jQuery) ?
[03:55:18] <Jattenalle> DRSK, what's wrong with .hide() and .show()?
[03:55:19] <seutje> wish I kept logs
[03:55:32] <Jattenalle> DRSK, also look at .animate()
[03:55:34] <velus> you on about what i have seutje
[03:55:41] <Cork> seutje: cause then you would have to do (function($) { $(function() {}); })(jQuery)
[03:55:57] <DRSK> Jattenalle » hide/show doesn't do what I want and animate() is a fallback in this matter
[03:56:06] <seutje> psh, doc rdy is so 2000
[03:56:14] <Cork> seutje: (function($) { $(function() {}); })(jQuery); === jQuery(function($) {});
[03:56:26] <Jattenalle> DRSK, .animate() does what you want though..
[03:56:58] <seutje> so there rly is no reason
[03:57:12] <DRSK> Jattenalle » yes, and that's a fallback for when CSS3 isn't available. Either way, that's not the issue. The issue is how to toggle between "hidden" and "visible" as well as making sure "visible" only applies when transitions are finished.
[03:57:34] <Jattenalle> DRSK, i'm not sure i understand what it is you're trying to achieve :/
[03:57:44] <DRSK> seutje » did you mean me when you said you posted yesterday?
[03:57:59] <Cork> seutje: well ya, unless you count code simplification
[03:58:23] <seutje> just the iife suffices tho
[03:58:33] <DRSK> Jattenalle » no worries, if you could help I'm guessing you would know what I was trying to do. :)
[03:59:07] <Jattenalle> DRSK, well there's no pure CSS3 way to "wait for animation to finish before doing other thing"
[03:59:13] * Jattenalle shrugs
[03:59:25] <Jattenalle> animation/transition
[03:59:35] <DRSK> Not sure what you mean, but there are in fact transitionend and animationend.
[04:00:25] <velus> yes seutje you did post that to me
[04:00:44] <velus> but im having problmes with the reload of the page
[04:05:53] <velus> ok just spotted response header are in html/text
[04:09:56] <seutje> velus: http://jsfiddle.net/6Cr2v/8/ prolly won't have to uppercase the method tho, not sure
[04:11:34] <velus> its ok seutje i just found out the php was not sending json headers first, i have now got it to send json headers
[04:11:50] <seutje> velus: OSNAP, the very first thing I mentioned
[04:12:21] <velus> yes and i couldnt find where the reponse headers was till i had to go the loo lol
[04:14:46] <dwarder> there was jquery templating engine, how is it called and where can i download one
[04:14:49] <dwarder> ?
[04:15:22] <seutje> `g jquery templating
[04:15:24] <b-ot> seutje: jQuery Templating | jQuery Plugin Registry → http://plugins.jquery.com/loadTemplate/1.4.1/
[04:16:38] <dwarder> seutje: have you used it?
[04:16:50] <seutje> nosir
[04:19:17] <seutje> when I do need templating, I usually use Underscore's, or a variant thereof
[04:21:51] <dwarder> seutje: i used handlebars
[04:21:56] <dwarder> seutje: i don't like it
[04:22:06] <dwarder> seutje: it is too confined
[04:22:23] <seutje> could always roll ur own, although I think you missed the trend
[04:22:37] <dwarder> seutje: missed the trend?
[04:23:05] <seutje> year or 3 ago everyone was rolling their templating library
[04:23:50] <dwarder> hmm i don't see iterators here https://github.com/codepb/jquery-template
[04:25:12] <msafi1> When I install jQuery through bower, I get jQuery undefined error messages. Anyone know what's changed recently in that regard?
[04:31:34] <msafi> Never mind, I think I screwed something up.
[04:34:04] <jop008> Can someone explains this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-03-11_at_12.32.31-1B0Xc16h.png I expected a cval of type string
[04:34:41] <jop008> but it gives an array. It is a select box end routine
[04:34:44] <Cork> jop008: make sure you don't have multiple element with the same id
[04:34:51] <Cork> uh
[04:34:53] <Cork> true...
[04:35:18] <jop008> how can I check this is happening?
[04:35:19] <Cork> jop008: check so you don't have an extension modifying .val
[04:35:24] <Cork> i've seen ppl have that
[04:35:44] <Cork> jop008: it isn't your case
[04:35:53] <Cork> i missed that you have the output above
[04:36:14] <jop008> $("#" + cname).length this is 1
[04:36:23] <jop008> so only once?
[04:36:25] <Cork> id selectors can never be more then one element
[04:36:43] <Cork> $('[id="' + cname + '"]').length
[04:36:50] <Cork> though like i said, most likely not your case
[04:37:23] <Cork> jop008: i would check if any plugin is redefining your $.fn.val function
[04:37:25] <jop008> okay what else can I think of
[04:37:46] <jop008> I have another routine working fine also on a select box
[04:37:46] <Cork> cause that looks like the case
[04:54:00] <Fred77> morning ppl
[05:00:22] <Fred77> I'm having a hard time passing a function to another function from within a on() event
[05:01:04] <Fred77> can anyone help me by taking a look at this jsbin http://jsbin.com/jizureci/1/edit?js
[05:04:58] <jop008> what is the return of a select .val () is it array or string?
[05:07:06] <jop008> it looks like bove in my code
[05:07:10] <jop008> both
[05:08:30] <jop008> It looks like array
[05:08:46] <Cork> Fred77: are you sure the loadMoreResults is actually accessible inside the search function?
[05:08:59] <Cork> jop008: .val() should always be a string
[05:09:15] <jop008> I got an aray
[05:09:16] <Cork> jop008: but yes something in your page replaces it with an array
[05:09:29] <Cork> meaning .val() isn't the jquery default one
[05:09:43] <jop008> can I check that?
[05:09:44] <Cork> i don't know if jqm does this
[05:09:51] <Fred77> Cork: yup, it is. If I call it within the search function or into ajax success it works just fine
[05:10:06] <Cork> jop008: search the code for $.fn.val or val: or similar
[05:10:21] <jop008> I don't have this
[05:10:31] <Fred77> Cork: the real trouble is that the .on() method seems not to pass a variable within the event.data
[05:10:45] <Cork> Fred77: wait a min, you arn't forwardning the callback through the timeout
[05:11:05] <Fred77> but it has no problem with a string or something similar
[05:11:18] <Fred77> Cork: lemme se
[05:11:43] <Cork> Fred77: setTimeout(neverEnding, 200) => setTimeout(function() { neverEnding(callback) }, 200)
[05:12:30] <jop008> I can display the function
[05:12:43] <jop008> to check if it is jq function
[05:12:43] <Fred77> yup
[05:12:49] <Fred77> just noticed that... thanks
[05:12:58] <Fred77> lemme see if that fixes the whole thing :)
[05:14:54] <jop008> this is what val returns as function
[05:14:55] <jop008> http://jsfiddle.net/fDqZu/219/
[05:15:45] <jop008> Is it the right one?
[05:16:01] <Fred77> Cork: dang it... it would work if only neverEnding() could be find from within the setTimeout
[05:16:31] <Cork> Fred77: if you define it like you did it would be
[05:17:21] <Cork> oh wait
[05:17:30] <Cork> callback will have been lost by that time though
[05:17:57] <Cork> Fred77: http://jsbin.com/jizureci/2/edit
[05:18:00] <Cork> that should work
[05:19:46] <Fred77> yay
[05:19:49] <Fred77> it works
[05:20:09] <ph88_> when i'm debugging with IE8 i see like <div class="selectFilters" JQuery1110040425079925044815="10" />      instead of a html tree .. what's going on ?
[05:20:22] <Fred77> I so not into js.... :D
[05:20:48] <Cork> ph88_: ouch debugging in ie8...
[05:20:53] <Fred77> thanks a lot Cork... you saved me from a few headaches...
[05:20:55] <ph88_> :'(
[05:20:55] <Cork> wouldn't ever cross my mind...
[05:21:03] <Cork> Fred77: np
[05:21:04] <fsioe> Sorry to bother yall, but I'm super lost. I'm creating a header that appears on scrolling up an disappears on scrolling down (kinda like on LinkedIn). For this I try $('div.main').scroll(). To debug, I set the callback to $('div.main').scroll(function(e){console.log(e)});. But nothing happens when I scroll that div? How can one start debugging this?
[05:21:11] <ph88_> Cork: how do you do it when you have javascript that needs to work in IE8 ?
[05:21:44] <Cork> ph88_: i learn what ie needs and if something break ripp out part of the code till it works
[05:21:51] <Cork> and then add it back to see where the problem is
[05:22:01] <Cork> i wouldn't trust that debugger with anything
[05:22:05] <ph88_> :P
[05:22:08] <Cork> ie10 is usable
[05:22:15] <Cork> and 11 is ok
[05:22:23] <Cork> 9 is... in desperate times
[05:22:30] <ph88_> IE8 FML
[05:22:30] <Cork> 7 and 8; no way
[05:22:34] <DRSK> Cork » say I have div.class, and class is dynamically added to div. Can I do $( 'div' ).filter( 'class' ); to get all divs with class? And if so, can I reverse it so that if filter( 'class' ).length <= 0 to check if any div in the set has the class?
[05:22:36] <ph88_> i got the message ye :P
[05:22:43] <ph88_> i'm just following orders
[05:23:20] <Cork> DRSK: by class do you mean the attribute or a placeholder for a specific class?
[05:23:36] <Cork> ph88_: what i meant is that i wouldn't use the debugger
[05:23:46] <Cork> even if i needed to make something work in < ie9
[05:23:50] <Cork> i wouldn't trust it
[05:24:08] <ph88_> how would go view the current html even? not all things can be inspected visually
[05:24:20] <ph88_> current dom tree
[05:24:31] <Cork> older ie's is messed up enough to chase you down wingly paths on widl goose chases
[05:24:47] <Cork> so no way
[05:25:12] <Cork> ph88_: as sparsly as possible :)
[05:25:21] <ankurk_> Good Morning Gentlemen :)
[05:25:27] <ph88_> so i've noticed, i made lovely screencast of how impossible it was to debug something even in ie10 :p
[05:25:33] <Cork> ph88: not sure if ie8 or ie9 introduced the dom in ie
[05:25:39] <Cork> before that it was just a text blob
[05:25:44] <DRSK> Cork » I am trying to figure out if a set of div elements "all" have a specific class, having that said though, I do not know the number of divs. I just need to know if they all have a specific class, :)
[05:25:57] <Cork> so... don't be surprised if you find strange dom structures
[05:26:30] <ph88_> Cork: it would be nice if you can get the AST from your code, then run it bit by bit in IE (automatically) and see where it crashes ...
[05:26:41] <Cork> DRSK: selectedDivs.hasClass('the-class-name')
[05:26:50] <Cork> oh wait all
[05:26:55] <DRSK> Cork » and if 1 of the selected divs don't have it, will that be false?
[05:27:00] <Cork> DRSK: selectedDivs.not('.the-class-name').length > 0
[05:27:11] <DRSK> ah, so stupid of me, right thanks
[05:27:16] <fsioe> Sorry to bother yall, but I'm super lost. I'm creating a header that appears on scrolling up an disappears on scrolling down (kinda like on LinkedIn). For this I try $('div.main').scroll(). To debug, I set the callback to $('div.main').scroll(function(e){console.log(e)});. But nothing happens when I scroll that div? How can one start debugging this?
[05:28:22] <Cork> fsioe: scroll fires on the scrolling element
[05:28:39] <Cork> so if .main isn't the element that is scrolling you won't get the event
[05:28:46] <Cork> also scroll isn't bubbling
[05:29:50] <Horacsio> My friends hello.
[05:30:26] <fsioe> Cork: if the pointer is on the div in question, and I'm scrolling (so that div moves), isnt that the scrolling event then?
[05:30:49] <Cork> fsioe: no
[05:30:50] <Horacsio> I have this fixed 600pxwidth div where I'll load wordpress titles for posts.
[05:30:59] <Cork> fsioe: scroll is when the scrollbar moves
[05:31:06] <Cork> or similar effect
[05:31:15] <Cork> not from an element moving on the page
[05:31:25] <Horacsio> The titles differs in terms of extension. so there'll be longer titles than others.
[05:31:50] <Horacsio> Yet I want the titles to full width that 600px div.
[05:32:09] <fsioe> Cork: but the scrollbar is moving? I'll try isolating the problem and making a jsfiddle
[05:32:15] <Cork> Horacsio: display: block;
[05:32:20] <Horacsio> I've tried the fittext plugin but somehow that doesnt work as I want
[05:32:37] <Cork> fsioe: the scroll event fires on the element with the overflow
[05:32:42] <Horacsio> let me show what I have
[05:32:50] <Cork> fsioe: not on children of the element that moves cause the overflow moves
[05:33:29] <Cork> Horacsio: i don't see why you need js at all for this
[05:33:33] <fsioe> Cork: overflow:scroll;? So a solution would be so wrap it in overflow: hidden; and the .main set to overflow: scroll;
[05:33:43] <Cork> fsioe: no
[05:34:03] <Cork> fsioe: again the element with the overflow; meaning the element that has the scrollbar
[05:34:13] <Cork> fsioe: is the element where the scroll event fires
[05:34:18] <Cork> fsioe: nowhere else
[05:34:26] <fsioe> Cork: is there a way to find out what element that is? Or to force it?
[05:34:45] <Cork> $(this).offsetParent()
[05:34:58] * Cork checks to be sure
[05:35:17] <Horacsio> I need to do this: http://baannng.com/Imagens/Adobe%20Illustrator%20CS5.1.png or if the title size increase: http://baannng.com/Imagens/Adobe%20Illustrator%20CS5.12.png
[05:36:08] <Cork> fsioe: hmm, actually that isn't guaranteed to be correct
[05:36:24] <Cork> fsioe: anyway it is the parent of the element that has overflow != visible
[05:36:35] <Horacsio> I've been under CSS too and they pointed me jquery as solution...
[05:36:35] <Cork> fsioe: if you don't have any it means the document
[05:37:15] <Cork> Horacsio: ha, you want to scale the element to match the width?
[05:37:24] <Horacsio> exactly...
[05:37:30] <Horacsio> http://baannng.com/?paged=5
[05:37:45] <Cork> that makes it harder ya
[05:37:54] <Horacsio> but it is possible?
[05:38:38] <Cork> it is
[05:38:42] <Cork> i've seen ppl do it
[05:39:07] <Cork> i think there are plugins for it too
[05:40:34] <Horacsio> I'm so pissed with this :( gee... I've lost hours to do this... there's also BigText...
[05:40:40] <Horacsio> I'm going to try it now
[05:40:57] <Horacsio> https://github.com/zachleat/BigText
[05:41:07] <Horacsio> Cork you see that first example there'
[05:41:08] <Horacsio> ?
[05:41:31] <Horacsio> You think instead of spans I could use other divs?
[05:41:32] <Cork> Horacsio: what you need to do is to take the dimention and calculate at what font size the text will still fit
[05:41:59] <Cork> Horacsio: the problem is that the browser doesn't provide this, or any good way to get the text dimensions
[05:42:07] <Cork> so, ya it is messy
[05:42:16] <seutje> what if the title is > 600 characters?
[05:42:18] <Horacsio> I don't know how to do that
[05:42:31] <Horacsio> it's a title, not a text :D
[05:42:46] <seutje> it's a CMS... content editors do silly things
[05:42:48] <Cork> whats the difference?!?
[05:42:59] <seutje> multiline?
[05:43:03] <Cork> titles normally are text...
[05:43:08] <Horacsio> but yes the idea is to keep all those characters inside one line inside a 600px div
[05:43:26] <seutje> if it's displayed in a custom font, you'll have another can of worms to deal with
[05:43:28] <Horacsio> titles aren't full text :D come on you know what I meant :D
[05:43:28] <Cork> so if it's 600 chars each char becomes 1px width?
[05:43:39] <Cork> or actaully less then 1px
[05:43:56] <seutje> yeah less, letter-spacing...
[05:44:09] <Cork> Horacsio: what you do is take an element with display: inline-block;
[05:44:11] <Horacsio> yes less... that would overlap letters
[05:44:15] <Cork> and then you set a font size
[05:44:25] <Cork> increase it if the element is smaller then 600
[05:44:30] <Cork> and reduce it if it is wider
[05:44:38] <Cork> this will be slow
[05:44:44] <seutje> px per px?
[05:44:44] <Cork> but there isn't really any other way to do it
[05:45:00] <Horacsio> isn't the opposite?
[05:45:06] <Cork> seutje: no you use escalation
[05:45:17] <seutje> oro?
[05:45:29] <Horacsio> forget it. you're correct increase if is smaller...
[05:45:39] <Cork> you start by adding say 10px and when you jump up and it becomes too big you reduce it by 5 px
[05:45:41] <Cork> and so on
[05:45:54] <Horacsio> how to do that?!
[05:46:10] <Cork> Horacsio: just check element.width()
[05:46:17] <Cork> and have it as display: inline-block;
[05:46:20] <Horacsio> I think I need to work with a jquery plugin... I don't know jquery :S
[05:46:49] <Cork> ya, i think there are plugins for this, but i don't know of an example
[05:47:05] <Cork> as i would fight with tooth and nail to prevent something like this from a project
[05:47:15] <Cork> as it means it won't scale for different devices
[05:47:48] <Cork> it's a kind of "looks perfect on the boss computer, but nowhere else"
[05:48:08] <Horacsio> this is a size fixed div. not everything need to be responsive :D
[05:58:24] <DRSK> Cork » care to take a quick look at this? - http://jsfiddle.net/KxgRL/1/  --> specifically I'm having some issues with line 10/11. Trying to get that to work :/
[06:00:55] <Cork> DRSK: you might want to have a look at transition-delay
[06:01:06] <Cork> should make that comment area not needed
[06:01:55] <Cork> DRSK: or if you mean that the hidden transition should end...
[06:02:02] <Cork> ya, those are fun...
[06:02:50] <DRSK> Cork » hehe, I'm simply trying to add the 'visible' class once the animation/transition of removing 'hidden' is finished. As you can see now, the "help box" isn't positioned as the "settings" one
[06:03:14] <DRSK> because it doesn't get enough time to properly gtfo I guess, and that's why I thought I'd wait until the animation/transition is complete before transitioning the next
[06:03:39] <Cork> DRSK: i would try something like http://jsfiddle.net/KxgRL/2/
[06:03:42] <DRSK> I could just add position: absolute; and ignore when it's done
[06:04:06] <Cork> DRSK: well transision delay can help you solve that
[06:04:34] <Cork> simply have a class you set that has a delay the same size as he visibility animation for the other element
[06:04:46] <DRSK> Cork » well with your example I kinda get the picture, but what do I do the 'first' time?
[06:04:47] <Cork> ?mdn transision-delay
[06:04:49] <b-ot> Cork: transition-delay - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-delay
[06:04:54] <DRSK> ^thanks
[06:05:11] <Cork> ah, right
[06:05:20] <Cork> heh that won't fire unless one element exist
[06:05:26] <DRSK> indeed
[06:05:31] <DRSK> and all is hidden from start
[06:05:44] <DRSK> hence the content.not( '.hidden' ).length > 0 thing you provided me with earlier
[06:05:46] <Cork> ya i would try seeing if i could have a relation and leave css do it
[06:05:56] <Cork> transisionend is a pain fiddling with
[06:05:58] <DRSK> just didn't implement that in the fiddle :p
[06:06:03] <DRSK> Yes it is, it gets fired all over the place
[06:06:21] <Cork> DRSK: well that is mainly cause you do multiple things
[06:06:32] <DRSK> Yeah, but I'd like it to treat them seperately
[06:06:39] <Cork> if you limit transision all to visibility it should be better
[06:06:53] <DRSK> But yeah, so what was your suggestion again?
[06:07:06] <DRSK> A relation and leave css to do it, not entirely following your thoughts on that one
[06:07:12] <Cork> DRSK: i would look at using transition-delay
[06:07:29] <DRSK> right, to make sure it gets enough time to finish?
[06:07:32] <Cork> and do something like addClass('delay.visible')
[06:07:39] <Cork> opps
[06:07:44] <Cork> * addClass('.delay.visible')
[06:08:03] <Cork> and not add the .delay part if you don't have any elements to animate
[06:08:21] <Cork> that way you don't have to fiddle with the event handler
[06:09:19] <DRSK> So when adding 'visible' to start animating, I add the delay class if nothing else is visible?
[06:09:29] <ph88_> i have this   console.log(JSON.stringify(that.model.get('selected')));   shows: []    then i do  if (subscribedCount !== (that.model.get('selected')).length) {   and i get "Object doesn't support this property or method"     problem with chaining in IE8 ?
[06:10:04] <Cork> DRSK: yes
[06:10:55] <Cork> ph88: why (that.model.get('selected')).length and not just that.model.get('selected').length ?
[06:11:12] <Cork> also what type of content does get('selected') return for you?
[06:11:15] <ph88_> i had that before, but that didn't work, so i tried with extra paranthesis
[06:11:32] <ph88_> Cork:   console.log(JSON.stringify(that.model.get('selected')));   shows: []
[06:12:07] <ph88_> hhmm if i use underscore js as helper it's not a problem ...    _(that.model.get('selected')).length
[06:12:09] <Cork> ph88: and console.log(that.model.get('selected').length) ?
[06:12:42] <ph88_> undefined
[06:12:51] <Cork> so .get() doesn't return an array
[06:13:04] <Cork> prob an array like object
[06:13:15] <Cork> and JSON just takes it as an array cause there is no keys
[06:13:41] <ph88_> hhmmzz yes i think when i do console.log(that.model.get('selected'));  it shows Object object or something
[06:14:49] <ph88_> i don't understand this .. but i will go with using underscore js to fix this problem for me ^^
[06:19:24] <DRSK> Cork » okay, how do I know if 'nothing else' is visible? Can I do content.is(':visible'); or something?
[06:19:47] <DRSK> Trying to find a way of adding that delay class when it's needed (meaning after the first animation)
[06:20:19] <Cork> DRSK: content.filter('.visible, .hidden').length > 0
[06:20:35] <seutje> do I even wanna scroll up for this? o.O
[06:20:44] <DRSK> don't :D
[06:20:47] <Cork> lol
[06:20:58] <seutje> ./clear
[06:21:07] <DRSK> phew
[06:29:47] <kaldrenon|work> Best practice question: I have a click event which targets an element that has children. I don't want my code to execute if one of the children is the immediate target. For example, if someone clicks inside a <td> I want to do stuff, but if someone clicks the <input> inside the <td>, I don't want that stuff to happen. I know I can use "return if event.target.tagName == 'INPUT'" but that feels a little hacky and frag
[06:31:01] <Cork> kaldrenon|work: do you want to allow clicking things like spans inside the td?
[06:31:11] <Cork> else you can just check this == event.target
[06:32:21] <kaldrenon|work> Cork: The td in question currently only holds an input (a checkbox). I wrote a click event that toggles the cb if the td gets clicked, but it also fires when I click the cb, making the cb toggle twice.
[06:33:20] <Cork> kaldrenon|work: $('table').on('click', 'td', function(event) { if(this != event.target) { return; } /* direct click code */ })
[06:35:19] <kaldrenon|work> Cork: That was easier than expected. I think I tried it with event.currentTarget and it didn't work.
[06:36:33] <ph88_> change line of code (2 seconds) -> stop debugging -> cache clear -> console clear -> start debugging -> reload page (total 2min) ... got to love ie8 :D
[06:36:52] <Cork> ya
[07:03:10] <greengriminal> Hi is there many people that have used: https://github.com/arnab/jQuery.PrettyTextDiff
[07:14:56] <m1chael> i am using jquery 1.8.2 and jquery mobile 1.2.0  but jquery's latest version == 1.11.0 or 2.1.0 AND jquery mobile latest version == 1.4.2 # what should i be running?
[07:15:31] <greengriminal> Trying to make use of: https://github.com/arnab/jQuery.PrettyTextDiff and i have the following fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/LSr6L/ now for some reason i cannot get it to work with textarea.
[07:15:45] <xec> m1chael: depends, do you need support for old IE?
[07:15:46] <greengriminal> I tried changing the selector from "tr" to "textarea" and this doesn't work.
[07:16:17] <m1chael> xec, no
[07:16:35] <xec> m1chael: then you can use jquery 2.*
[07:16:46] <xec> and whatever the latest jquery ui is
[07:18:38] <xec> s/ui/mobile
[07:19:07] <m1chael> ok, cool
[07:22:55] <Velveeta> greengriminal: you're trying to output the prettified diff *into* a textarea, or use the textarea as the source from which you're diffing text?
[07:29:09] <Velveeta> well, here's a start for you anyway: http://jsfiddle.net/LSr6L/2/ ... be aware, though, that a textarea can't be used for prettified output like that, you may want to consider using a contenteditable div or something
[07:34:30] <Velveeta> here's an update w/ a contenteditable div in place instead: http://jsfiddle.net/LSr6L/3/
[07:35:16] <Velveeta> and one last one with the initial selector made a little more sane: http://jsfiddle.net/LSr6L/4/
[07:44:24] <jop008> How to filter like this <p class="placeinstruction"?
[07:44:36] <jop008> give all elements like this
[07:44:42] <NoiseEee> come on jop008
[07:44:52] <NoiseEee> how do you think you might select all p elements with the class 'placeinstruction'
[07:44:53] <jop008> I google
[07:44:58] <NoiseEee> this is basic
[07:45:03] <NoiseEee> this is the basic stepping stone
[07:45:05] <NoiseEee> learn or gtfo
[07:45:13] <NoiseEee> no offense but it seems you cant be bothered to retain a single thing
[07:45:17] <NoiseEee> so
[07:45:29] <jop008> $("span[class='apple']").hide();
[07:45:29] <NoiseEee> how *might* you do that. id be happy to help correct you etc
[07:46:07] <NoiseEee> are those two different questions or?
[07:47:17] <greengriminal> Velveeta: Yes I am trying to output the prettied diff into a textarea
[07:47:50] <greengriminal> Velveeta: Thanks for your input
[07:50:33] <greengriminal> Velveeta: I was not aware of contenteditable. Seems pretty cool. Thanks for the update
[07:51:26] <Velveeta> greengriminal: that's about as close as you're going to get to what you're wanting, because textareas won't render html content
[07:51:44] <greengriminal> Velveeta: Right, gotcha.
[07:53:03] * Velveeta grabs a bucket of popcorn and watches NoiseEee and jop008.
[07:53:24] <greengriminal> Velveeta: I really was working with this initially: http://cemerick.github.io/jsdifflib/demo.html
[07:53:35] <greengriminal> but wanted something more closer to jQuery/Angular
[07:53:47] <greengriminal> and came across jQuery prettyDiff
[07:54:20] <Velveeta> are you using angular in your project?
[07:54:45] <Velveeta> because if that's the case, i'd probably find a way to wrap that plugin in a directive/service so you could use it naturally with the rest of the angular app
[07:55:21] <greengriminal> Yes I am using angular
[07:55:35] <greengriminal> I may just do that.
[07:57:11] <sadtaco> AngularJS looks cool. But it also looks like something like that would have very poor performance in a heavy web app
[07:58:51] <Velveeta> i haven't been exposed to a whole lot of angular yet, and i'm not sure how heavy of a web app you mean by 'heavy', but we have a pretty medium-sized one at my company running on it
[07:59:35] <Velveeta> it definitely helps with code organization and modularity, and dependency injection is at its core, which is great, but i cannot get over the bastardization it does to the markup
[08:03:01] <slide> Does anyone know of an image slider that has a method for adding images after its been setup?
[08:04:03] <ankurk_> Velveeta: Emberjs is surely better than Angular
[08:04:15] <Velveeta> why surely?
[08:05:12] <ankurk_> Because of the conventions
[08:05:17] <ankurk_> and Ember Data
[08:05:56] <Velveeta> i've got 0 exposure to ember, so you'll have to elaborate a little
[08:07:51] <ankurk_> Ember has a lot of conventions. Basically it follows conventions over configuration,
[08:08:06] <ankurk_> No Dependency injection whatsoever
[08:08:52] <Velveeta> you say 'no dependency injection' like that's a strength? i prefer DI as a pattern..
[08:09:21] <fn> does anyone worked with cycle plugin?
[08:09:22] <fn> [cycle] 1  - img slide not loaded, requeuing slideshow:
[08:09:24] <Velveeta> do ember's conventions allow for runtime swapping of dependencies?
[08:09:32] <fn> and could explain to prevent this?
[08:10:16] <ankurk_> I am not sure since I know little about Ember myself but it's surely better, you should check out discourse which is built with Ember
[08:10:49] <Velveeta> i'll do some reading about both ember and discourse, but it seems a bit premature if you don't know much about a framework, to say it's surely better than another framework..
[08:13:22] <Forbidd3n> When I load jquery dialog with external page it isn't rendering the javascript functions in the page that loaded the dialog window. Do I have to include the js files in the page being loaded in the dialog window?
[08:14:21] <Velveeta> forbidd3n: are you talking about loading a dialog with like an iframe in it?
[08:17:57] <ankurk_> I know it seems premature, but my experience with it has been smooth so far
[08:19:08] <Velveeta> i have a few tabs open already, to compare pros and cons of angular vs ember, and in some cases backbone also
[08:19:33] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: modalWindow('page.php','Title');
[08:20:18] <Velveeta> forbidd3n: that doesn't answer the question, but i'm *assuming* page.php is being loaded in an iframe inside the dialog, as opposed to ajax-loaded and injected into your dialog.. can you confirm whether it's loading in an iframe or not?
[08:21:00] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: it is using the jquery modal dialog
[08:21:16] <Forbidd3n> there is no iframe
[08:21:33] <Velveeta> so then how is the page.php content being loaded? via ajax?
[08:22:30] <jop008> Can you do this $('[class="placeinstruction*"]').each(function () {
[08:22:47] <jop008> so also if the item has more than one class
[08:23:08] <Velveeta> jop008: have you read the documentation for selectors?
[08:23:18] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:23:40] <Forbidd3n> Velveeta: it is being loaded via ajax, sorry for my confusion.
[08:24:12] <Velveeta> forbidd3n: ok, so it's loading that content and injecting it into the dialog, and you say the functions that aren't executing live where, in page.php ?
[08:25:09] <Forbidd3n> the function is in the page that runs the js function to call the modal window
[08:25:12] <Velveeta> if i re-read your question, it sounds like page A loads a dialog, which in turn loads page B and injects it into the dialog, and the functions in page A are not being fired on the content from page B, does that sound right?
[08:25:30] <Forbidd3n> correct
[08:25:41] <Velveeta> what kinds of functions in page A aren't being fired?
[08:25:49] <Velveeta> is it like a document.ready thing, or something else?
[08:25:49] <jop008> I need a for each loop $('[class="placeinstruction"]').each(function () {
[08:26:14] <NoiseEee> jop008: congrats, you;ve got one
[08:26:14] <Velveeta> jop008: again i ask, have you read the documentation for selectors?
[08:26:39] <Forbidd3n> I am setting a click function to each checkbox - $('input[type="checkbox"]').each(function(){ ... });
[08:26:41] <Velveeta> like noiseeee said earlier, this is basic basic jquery stuff, this is actually step 1 in learning jquery: selectors
[08:27:04] <shilon> I had query plugins installed on my web app and I tried bower, added the new scripts with bower and my plugins stopped working. Anyone can tell me why is this happening?
[08:27:06] <Velveeta> forbidd3n: ok, there's your problem... your click function is most likely being attached before the content from page B is loaded
[08:27:21] <Forbidd3n> it isn't running through the checkboxes on initial load, which I understand because they don't exist yet, how can I get it to do it after it laods?
[08:27:23] <Forbidd3n> loads
[08:27:40] <Velveeta> you want to use event delegation rather than direct binding
[08:27:55] <Velveeta> similar to the old .live() functionality
[08:28:08] <groundup> Why isn't add action adding anything: http://jsfiddle.net/LvBC6/
[08:28:19] <Forbidd3n> sorry not a click function, just applying something to all checkboxes when page laods
[08:28:20] <Forbidd3n> loads
[08:28:21] <Morl0ck> Forbidd3n: you can use $(document).on('click', 'element', function () {});
[08:28:25] <Velveeta> but now using .on(), with something like this: $(document).on('click', ':checkbox', callback)
[08:29:00] <Velveeta> if you're applying something to all checkboxes, rather than attaching an event listener, then you're going to have to manually maintain that when you inject new checkboxes
[08:29:28] <Forbidd3n> figured that after discussing it with you. thanks for the help
[08:30:31] <jop008> I changed the logic and used addclass problem solved
[08:32:28] <Velveeta> groundup: added a document.ready wrapper, and you need to be appending a .clone() of your node, otherwise, you're re-appending the same node over and over, for no visible change: http://jsfiddle.net/LvBC6/3/
[08:33:19] <groundup> I want to kiss your creamy goodness. Thanks :D
[08:33:38] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[08:47:36] <m1chael> i'm battling with a strange css issue.. http://infobuzz.me/static/test/ # celebrity name auto complete text box should be overlayed/lined up with that faint same-shaped inputbox outline.. i can't figure out what the issue is.. do you guys have any tricks for figuring this out?
[08:48:17] <gordian> m1chael: best trick is to head to #css for css issues
[08:49:06] <m1chael> it's got something to do with jquery mobile i think
[08:50:39] <duch_kazatel> the default styling seems off - the pre tag that contains that text has some funky styling.
[08:51:16] <fps> hi, http://api.jquery.com/unload/ is marked as deprecated. what replaces its functionality
[08:51:16] <duch_kazatel> wait a sec...
[08:51:19] <duch_kazatel> this is bizarro
[08:51:19] <fps> ?
[08:51:46] <duch_kazatel> fps "The exact handling of the unload event has varied from version to version of browsers. For example, some versions of Firefox trigger the event when a link is followed, but not when the window is closed. In practical usage, behavior should be tested on all supported browsers, and contrasted with the proprietary beforeunload event."
[08:52:01] <fps> duch_kazatel: so there's no replacement?
[08:52:29] <NoiseEee> fps: same as javascript natural, 'unload' cant be trusted.  beforeunload is what you want, it works in a specific manner
[08:52:34] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[08:52:50] <duch_kazatel> and use $(window).on('beforeunload', function(){});
[08:52:52] <drej> NoiseEee you going to jqueryto ?
[08:53:02] <NoiseEee> i dont think so drej
[08:53:12] <fps> ah ok. i misread that note then. i thought "proprietary" meant also not standardized and thus not reliable
[08:53:32] <drej> NoiseEee :(
[08:53:43] <duch_kazatel> fps check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/beforeunload
[08:54:07] <fps> duch_kazatel: thanks
[08:54:59] <Seus2k3> question: I'm using jquery .animate() that just brings over a div into the view (moves left to right), however it has terrible performance on anything other than my desktop. Is there a way to improve the performance in some way?
[08:55:17] <duch_kazatel> fps sure. be aware most of those event hook convenience methods (.click(), .beforeunload(), etc) are just shorthand for .on('event' - i always reccommend people use the latter syntax and learn the different events available to them.
[09:02:51] <fps> duch_kazatel: ok
[09:05:05] <fn> [cycle] 1  - img slide not loaded, requeuing slideshow: <<< how can i prevent this?
[09:06:45] <Forbidd3n> How can I do this with all checkboxes with specific class?
[09:06:45] <Forbidd3n> $('input[type="checkbox"]').each(function(){
[09:06:57] <duch_kazatel> $('input[type="checkbox"].class').each(function(){
[09:07:05] <duch_kazatel> that'll be slow thought.
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> *though
[09:07:14] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[09:07:26] <Forbidd3n> any other way to do it faster?
[09:07:54] <duch_kazatel> don't use an attribute selector - try to add a class to the specific things you want to select instead.
[09:07:58] <duch_kazatel> and select on the class.
[09:13:05] <farn5w0rth> how do i add a bootstrap button to a dataTable?
[09:32:50] <anli> Is kendoui setting some style on the document when the orientation goes landscape?
[09:33:00] <anli> Sorry if this question is a bit off channel
[09:33:17] <fps> i suppose kendioui is some web framework?
[09:33:22] <anli> yes
[09:33:23] <root> guys I got a issue
[09:33:34] <fps> css has some ways to differentiate between different layouts/screensizes, etc
[09:33:36] <fps> maybe it uses that
[09:33:36] <root> you think you can help me?
[09:33:41] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ root
[09:33:42] <b-ot> root: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:33:48] <anli> fps: ah, must check
[09:34:03] <duch_kazatel> anli looks like it.
[09:34:24] <fps> anli: i don't remember the details [i don't do much css] but it's often used in "reactive" design
[09:34:27] <fps> anli: check in #css
[09:34:38] <duch_kazatel> fps they're asking about the framework, not about CSS>
[09:36:04] <duch_kazatel> anli a cursory search shows kendo adds some stuff so you can target specific device orientations.
[09:36:20] <root> http://5.175.138.115/tst/ why doesn't on change work on all textboxes?
[09:37:15] <duch_kazatel> what is the change function doing, root?
[09:37:34] <root> if you look below the form there's a textbox
[09:37:44] <root> whenever you type in it it executes a function
[09:37:58] <root> but the problem is that this isn't working with all the other textboxes
[09:38:09] <duch_kazatel> ah, ajax.
[09:38:14] <root> can you see the 1's next to day, thats a textbox
[09:38:15] <root> yes
[09:38:23] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation - the textboxes don't exist when you run the binding.
[09:38:51] <duch_kazatel> do something like $('.connect_lists').on('change', 'input', function(){});
[09:39:16] <sunbeam> I'd still need some help, I'd like to foreach any element in my HTML page that starts with width-
[09:39:20] <sunbeam> how can I best do this?
[09:39:39] <root> what im trying to do is post on text change
[09:39:42] <duch_kazatel> "any element" sunbeam ?  that's not a valid tagname.
[09:39:50] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: "what" starts with 'width-' ?
[09:39:54] <duch_kazatel> root right - replace your .change() handler.
[09:40:06] <duch_kazatel> root replace it with what i just gave you.
[09:40:13] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: classes sorry
[09:40:22] <sunbeam> .width-* - want to foreach them all in jq
[09:40:26] <sunbeam> with jq*
[09:40:44] <sunbeam> so width-1000 width-200 etc
[09:40:47] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam that's going to be horribly slow.
[09:40:49] <sunbeam> .width-150
[09:40:56] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam do you control the HTML?
[09:40:56] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: hmm
[09:41:00] <Morl0ck> sunbeam $('[class^=width-]') something like that
[09:41:04] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: not really, it's a CMS
[09:41:10] <sunbeam> Morl0ck: thanks
[09:41:28] <Morl0ck> but i think thats reallyyyy slow
[09:41:33] <root> it finally works
[09:41:34] <root> thx
[09:41:36] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: also, google helps.  'selector for element attribute that starts with'
[09:41:46] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam that's going to be shit performance.
[09:41:48] <root> and I'm guessing that I can use $(this) to get the value correct?
[09:41:53] <sunbeam> I  tried what Morl0ck says but doesn't do anything
[09:41:57] <duch_kazatel> root yep
[09:42:01] <sunbeam> ehh sec
[09:42:01] <sunbeam> sorry
[09:42:02] <root> alright thx
[09:42:08] <root> also 1 more question
[09:42:16] <root> how could I have ajax work in realtime?
[09:42:22] <root> without sleeping loops?
[09:42:48] <duch_kazatel> root don't.
[09:42:54] <duch_kazatel> root use callbacks or promises.
[09:43:04] <Nallown> My name is Nallown not roto lol
[09:43:15] <Nallown> irssi fcked up and gave me that name
[09:43:34] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[09:43:49] <duch_kazatel> Nallown learn how callbacks work.
[09:43:58] <duch_kazatel> that's why they exist.
[09:44:00] <Nallown> but the only thing im wondering is that when dragging do i just stop the callback?
[09:44:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:44:21] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: NoiseEee I use .filter now as someone suggested
[09:44:29] <Nallown> you can drag these notes around
[09:44:39] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: NoiseEee Morl0ck all the classes I'm will have another class called .column aswell
[09:44:45] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: why use filter? is is an xhr response or a web document?
[09:44:53] <duch_kazatel> Nallown you should prevent user input during the ajax action.
[09:45:02] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: so add it to the selector
[09:45:07] <Nallown> ah k thx
[09:45:20] <duch_kazatel> Nallown huh?
[09:45:25] <duch_kazatel> woops nvm.
[09:45:28] <duch_kazatel> long morning.
[09:47:53] <RabSimpson> hi folks. i've got a nivo slider installed and for whatever reason it isn't using the transitions in safari, but it is in firefox. any ideas? here's the link (lap dancing club, no nudity, but potentially nsfw): http://www.diamond-dolls.co.uk
[09:49:13] <Morl0ck> RabSimpson: i see it working fine in my safari
[09:49:35] <RabSimpson> morl0ck: it's using the boxRain effect?
[09:49:50] <Morl0ck> yeah from left to right
[09:50:04] <Morl0ck> same as in chrome and firefox for me
[09:50:16] <RabSimpson> that's so odd. i've got caches disabled and i'm just getting an abrupt change from one image to the next.
[09:51:35] <Morl0ck> I'm on mac osx 10.9.2
[09:51:40] <Morl0ck> if it helps
[09:51:56] <Morl0ck> safari version Version 7.0.2 (9537.74.9)
[09:52:30] <RabSimpson> i'm using 6.1.2 on 10.7.5
[09:53:07] <RabSimpson> i haven't upgraded to mavericks because i've got a western digital external that i don't trust to play nice afterwards
[09:53:57] <Nallown> alright I'm leaving duch_kazatel, thanks for your help
[09:54:06] <duch_kazatel> of course, Nallown
[09:54:49] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: I just want to check what's after width- ?
[09:55:08] <sunbeam> var total_width = /width-/.test(elm.className);
[09:55:57] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: sorry, confused.
[09:56:13] <Morl0ck> RabSimpson: how does the demo look on your safari? http://demo.dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/
[09:57:20] <RabSimpson> morl0ck: demo appears to be working as expected
[09:58:05] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: If the current element $(this) has a class that starts with width- I need to know if that what's after width- is more than 0
[09:58:16] <decx> $('[class*="width"]').attr('class').replace('width-','')
[09:58:16] <sunbeam> that's what I need to know, can this be done with regexp?
[09:58:42] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: you're giving classes like "width-0" "width-1" etc?  that suggests Doin' It Wrong
[09:58:46] <sunbeam> decx: I need it for $(this)
[09:58:50] <NoiseEee> maybe you want to use a "data-width" element instead
[09:58:51] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: I know it is a bad practice
[09:58:55] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: but it's the CMS
[09:59:00] <sunbeam> where I cannot change anything
[09:59:46] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam what CMS is this?
[10:00:04] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: some custom of a small company
[10:00:22] <duch_kazatel> is it your company?
[10:00:25] <sunbeam> no
[10:00:47] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: so you want a proper regex with capturing groups, and then look in the capturing group for the number.  see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/432493/how-do-you-access-the-matched-groups-in-a-javascript-regular-expression for ideas/etc and come up with something... try it, if it doesnt work, make a jsfiddle and someone will help
[10:01:01] <duch_kazatel> if you're a contractor, tell them to add a data-width property to the markup or the page will perform like absolute shit.
[10:01:07] <Morl0ck> sunbeam: this should give you your result, i presume "width-800".match(/width-(.*)/)[1]
[10:01:24] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: thanks
[10:01:26] <NoiseEee> Morl0ck: just do *all* his work for him  :P
[10:01:32] <sunbeam> Morl0ck: thanks
[10:01:37] <Morl0ck> crap you're right NoiseEee
[10:01:38] <Morl0ck> sorry
[10:01:49] <NoiseEee> np your call :)
[10:02:13] <NoiseEee> there are a few people who are here very often who seem to ask the same questions / demonstrate they're not really that interested in 'learning'.  ahem so
[10:02:54] <genomespam> hello guys
[10:03:05] <genomespam> i've got a piece of code that i load into the document through ajax
[10:03:20] <genomespam> the think is that the spinner (jquery ui) inside won't work after the load
[10:03:31] <Morl0ck> NoiseEee i understand, i'll try to help people more first.
[10:22:35] <chriscalip> hello trying to learn about chaining and anonymous functions inside the chain.. can someone please check what im doing wrong
[10:22:36] <chriscalip> http://jsfiddle.net/9PnyZ/1/
[10:23:14] <duch_kazatel> huh?>
[10:23:21] <duch_kazatel> is .function(){ a thing?
[10:23:39] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like it.
[10:24:06] <chriscalip> yup its wrong. im trying to understand how to do it write.. but with my particular context
[10:24:13] <shoky> the . operator is for properties/methods that an object has, not for any old function
[10:24:16] <duch_kazatel> huh?  what is your "context"?
[10:24:17] <chriscalip> i need access to the variables inside the chain
[10:24:21] <duch_kazatel> what variables?
[10:24:27] <chriscalip> for my custom function
[10:24:28] <duch_kazatel> what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:24:33] <decx> maybe something like this is what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9PnyZ/3/
[10:24:40] <chriscalip> variables passed around.. while chaining
[10:24:51] <duch_kazatel> that's not how chaining works.
[10:24:52] <BillCriswell> chriscalip: just $foo.css('color','red').text('New Text') would work.
[10:25:45] <chriscalip> the text function part is just for illustration purposes.. what i really want to do is .. do a custom function with custom code inside it..
[10:26:03] <chriscalip> i really dont want to call the text function at all..
[10:26:07] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip that makes literally no sense.
[10:26:24] <BillCriswell> chriscalip: What do you want to do to the element?
[10:26:27] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/9PnyZ/4/
[10:26:39] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip you're being terrifically vague.  look at what decx provioded.
[10:26:48] <chriscalip> nothing to do with the element at all. i just want to learn how to do chaining.
[10:27:02] <duch_kazatel> you have to create a plugin to do that.
[10:27:10] <duch_kazatel> and extend the $.fn prototype.
[10:27:21] <duch_kazatel> $.fn.aFunction = function(){};
[10:27:24] <BillCriswell> and return this;
[10:27:40] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[10:27:58] <shoky> wish they'd stop calling them plugins :\
[10:28:14] <chriscalip> ok. so i really have to declare/create a plugin function before calling the chaining.. and not be able to create on the fly.. inside the chaining
[10:28:15] <BillCriswell> shoky: What would you prefer?
[10:28:18] <decx> i don't need another "modules" folder
[10:28:23] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip no.
[10:28:29] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip you can't just "do it on the fly"
[10:28:43] <BillCriswell> chriscalip: You could pass a function to many jQuery methods.
[10:28:49] <shoky> i donno, "extension method" or something
[10:29:01] <duch_kazatel> chriscalip unless you're within a callback - $('a').on('click', function(){ /* your custom stuff here */ });
[10:29:11] <BillCriswell> $('.foo').text(function(i,text){ return text + ' Hurrah!'; })
[10:29:25] <chriscalip> duch_kazatel thank you thats what im trying to figure out.. if i can create on the fly inside the chaininng
[10:29:34] <duch_kazatel> that's not what that is.
[10:29:46] <duch_kazatel> you can create an anonymous function within a callback - that's not "chaning" per se.
[10:30:00] <duch_kazatel> thhat's simply putting an anonymous function inside the callback.
[10:30:16] <chriscalip> that makes sense.. the method needs to be inside the object chain
[10:30:32] <duch_kazatel> that's... not the right way to put that.
[10:30:54] <chriscalip> pardon me. trying to learn javascript and jquery..
[10:31:01] <chriscalip> what would be the right way to put it?
[10:31:07] <duch_kazatel> again, the anonymouse function is inside the callback.
[10:31:33] <chriscalip> and callback is a method of the jquery object .. right?
[10:31:34] <duch_kazatel> the callback is invoked by a method that might be chained off another method, or that method might be called on just a jquery object.
[10:31:41] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:32:12] <duch_kazatel> $('a').on('click', function(){ /* This is the body of the anonymous callback */ });
[10:32:20] <duch_kazatel> the .on() is a method of the jquery object.
[10:32:32] <chriscalip> ok thanks.
[10:32:48] <duch_kazatel> if I were to add something to the end of that - $('a').on('click', function(){}).text('some text');
[10:33:02] <duch_kazatel> that .text() is using method chaining.
[10:33:09] <duch_kazatel> you're chaining methods.
[10:33:17] <duch_kazatel> one method doesn't really consistute chaining.
[10:34:05] <BillCriswell> shoky: I always disliked the term "plugin"... feels misleading.
[10:34:55] <decx> you plug it in, the rest is just semantics
[10:35:04] <decx> just don'T forget to pull out
[10:35:54] <BillCriswell> $.gn.plugin = function(){}
[10:36:13] <BillCriswell> or would you just do undefined?
[10:36:48] <BillCriswell> Guess it doesn't matter that much.
[10:37:18] * shoky ponders
[10:40:51] <nhulea> howdy all
[10:41:54] <nhulea> have you guys seen this i was rolling through github for a bit and came a cross it looks like a pretty interesting project http://getpopcornti.me/
[10:42:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah i saw this on hackernews earlier.
[10:42:42] <nhulea> pretty cool I have not got a movie to load yet but my internet is slow where I am right now
[10:42:57] <nhulea> I feel like it need a strong connection
[10:43:01] <nhulea> needs
[10:43:04] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[10:43:22] <nhulea> hackernews what the heck it that
[10:43:29] <nhulea> is that
[10:43:35] <duch_kazatel> https://news.ycombinator.com
[10:43:44] <decx> µtorrent had a watch now option for a while
[10:44:16] <nhulea> "Popcorn Time Is So Good at Movie Piracy, It’s Scary"
[10:44:20] <nhulea> haha
[10:44:28] <duch_kazatel> there were a few headlines submitted today about it.
[10:44:49] <nhulea> decx: yeah it was pretty decent i remmeber
[10:45:23] <decx> and hacker news is like reddit 4 years ago
[10:45:49] <duch_kazatel> i don't read the comments ever.  I just trawl for stories.
[10:46:11] <duch_kazatel> i treat it like slashdot
[10:46:15] <decx> the comments are the best part about hacker news
[10:46:19] <duch_kazatel> ugh
[10:46:24] <decx> "did paul irish just burn me?"
[10:47:04] <nhulea> yeah I love the comments on imgur its pretty competitive haha
[10:47:14] <decx> but i guess with its newfound popularity the quality is bound to go down
[10:48:52] <manus> Hi folks, is there any channel where I can ask questions specific to Sizzle?
[10:49:22] <duch_kazatel> manus this is generally a safe place for that.
[10:49:25] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:49:32] <manus> Thanks, duch_kazatel
[10:51:28] <manus> I bet this is asked a bunch, and I think I might know the answer, but is there any particular reason that certain pseudoselectors have been removed from Sizzle support, even for browsers that support them natively?
[10:51:37] <manus> And yes, I've read this http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:52:07] <manus> And this: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/44
[10:53:41] <duch_kazatel> weeeeeee
[10:53:46] <manus> (I'm specifically talking about ":hover" here)
[10:54:06] <manus> My understanding of the issue is that for the browsers that have buggy implementations, the devs say there would need to be special event handlers to shim it
[10:54:17] <duch_kazatel> manus i didn'
[10:54:29] <duch_kazatel> *didn't see the question - have a fiddle up illustrating the problem?
[10:55:37] <manus> duch_kazatel: no need tor a fiddle, it's just that ":hover" doesn't work for certain browsers/modes that natively support it
[10:55:45] <manus> IE8 standards mode, for example
[10:56:00] <duch_kazatel> the hover psuedoclass?
[10:56:10] <duch_kazatel> oh as apart of a sizzle selector?
[10:56:25] <manus> duch_kazatel: yep
[10:57:31] <manus> And I've read this: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation#wiki--selectors
[10:58:00] <duch_kazatel> i guess i tend to prefer to hook into the eventing interface instead.
[10:58:41] <manus> duch_kazatel: there are use cases for supporting the pseudoselector, though
[10:58:59] <manus> I want to use .is(':hover')
[10:59:21] <manus> (for a tooltip plugin, for example)
[10:59:22] <duch_kazatel> i tend to prefer to hook into the mouseenter event instead.
[10:59:41] <duch_kazatel> because otherwise tracking the document gets way hairy.
[11:00:01] <manus> duch_kazatel: if an element disappears from the DOM, though, there is no mouseleave
[11:00:41] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:00:52] <duch_kazatel> why do you have to use the mouseleave?
[11:01:14] <duch_kazatel> if it disappears, no big deal?
[11:02:43] <manus> duch_kazatel: If an element disappears, I want to know that I'm no longer hovering over it and can hide the tooltip. Though I think we're getting too far into a specific example and away from my question.
[11:03:04] <manus> My point is that the ':hover' has quite a few valid use cases
[11:03:12] <duch_kazatel> sure, it'd also be slow as balls to implement.
[11:03:49] <duch_kazatel> in that particular use case, I still don't see the point - if you're writing a plugin, let the imnplementor decide when to show/hide them.
[11:03:55] <manus> depends on how it's done, but yes, a shim would be relatively slow for browsers that don't natively support it
[11:03:56] <duch_kazatel> powertip does a good job of making that a reality.
[11:04:42] <manus> duch_kazatel: let's drop the example :] I can explain, but it's not my question
[11:04:43] <duch_kazatel> i guess i'm so used to the events available to me that I don't personally see it as an issue.
[11:05:46] <manus> I'm not making a case for the existence of a pseudoselector that already exists, I just want to know why it's not uniformly supported on the browsers that have it natively
[11:06:19] <manus> should I ask in #jquery-dev ?
[11:07:00] <duch_kazatel> because jquery (and often Sizzle, by extension), try to only support those features that are uniformly supported accross browsers without major issues.  a shim to support what you want is likely terribly non-performant.,
[11:07:05] <duch_kazatel> that's my guess at least.
[11:07:11] <duch_kazatel> #jquery-dev might be a good place to ask.
[11:08:58] <manus> duch_kazatel: I largely agree, though it's just strange that jQuery/sizzle would behave inconsistently with any selector, supported or not. Thanks for your help, though! I'll check in #jquery-dev.
[11:09:08] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[11:10:46] <manus> duch_kazatel: ?
[11:10:52] <duch_kazatel> "...though it's just strange that jQuery/sizzle would behave inconsistently with any selector, supported or not."
[11:11:06] <duch_kazatel> i think i missed something - are you familiar with how sizzle works?
[11:16:30] <manus> duch_kazatel: moderately, I've skimmed the code. Though I just had a theory and tested it, and it seems jQuery migrate is messing with me. My example was $(document.body).is(':hover')
[11:18:10] <manus> duch_kazatel: ah, I see
[11:19:13] <manus> duch_kazatel: not migrate's fault, but $('body:hover'), for example, gives me the body. $('body:hover').is(':hover') gives me an error.
[11:19:53] <duch_kazatel> ah, whereas $('body').is(':hover') works
[11:20:53] <duch_kazatel> i'll bet that there's some funk going on with the underlying javavascript in those cases.
[11:21:22] <manus> duch_kazatel: not exactly, $('body').is(':hover') also gives an error (at least on 1.9.1, testing on jquery.com)
[11:21:37] <duch_kazatel> which browser?
[11:21:48] <manus> duch_kazatel: chrome current
[11:22:14] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't give an error in 1.8.3 :)
[11:22:21] <duch_kazatel> looks like 1.9 magic.
[11:22:50] <manus> duch_kazatel: it's known that 1.8 still supports :hover under the covers
[11:24:02] <dan_j> Hi, I'm trying to work out why  $("body").scrollTop() is always 0 in firefox. Any ideas?
[11:24:07] <manus> and it's aso apparently known that 1.9 doesn't.. can't find exact issues, but they're out there.
[11:24:18] <duch_kazatel> wonder if that has anything to do with the psuedoevent removal.
[11:24:25] <duch_kazatel> dan_j try window instead?
[11:24:45] <manus> duch_kazatel: I was thinking that, too, but I can't seem to find where the change is. I think it's on the sizzle side.
[11:26:15] <decx> yes it's window scrollTop
[11:26:32] <tucan> does it ever make sense to use both prototype and jquery
[11:26:39] <tucan> on the same page
[11:27:02] <dan_j> Perfect. Thanks
[11:27:08] <decx> put some mootools in there as well
[11:27:22] <decx> then you have everything that was required for a wordpress template in 2009
[11:28:20] <decx> i havent kept up with prototype at all, really depends on what you want to do tucan
[11:29:18] <duch_kazatel> tucan nooooooo
[11:29:36] <tucan> im not sure, i have a frontend guy that gave me something with Prototype but i was already using jquery
[11:29:54] <tucan> got to get him to redo it
[11:30:10] <NoiseEee> tucan: not really, it doesnt make sense, both can do the same thing and prototype.js stopped being worked on a long time ago. there is no way a 'frontend guy' should be using prototype.js after 2012
[11:35:31] <decx> anybody done any canvas stuff and know how i can stop chrome from shitting itself when i want to drawImage on a canvas area that is > 1000px
[11:38:00] <ankurk_> decx: I never tried canvas stuff but did you try it on Firefox instead?
[11:38:38] <decx> that's the thing, firefox does it great
[11:38:56] <decx> http://canvas.decx.org
[11:39:24] <drej> whats wrong with it in chrome?
[11:39:43] <decx> it's slowing down hard
[11:40:14] <drej> seems fine to me
[11:40:21] <decx> but if you make the window smaller and the max-width: 100% rule applies, it becomes faster despite still rendering the same thing
[11:40:23] <drej> its super smooth
[11:40:27] <decx> chrome windows?
[11:40:27] <drej> except that level is impossible
[11:40:30] <drej> chrome osx
[11:40:52] <ankurk_> Chrome on Windows is kinda shitty
[11:40:52] <decx> must be something with requestaninmationframes vsync on chrome windows
[11:42:00] <decx> i checked some other drawimage heavy experiments in chrome with full screen and they had the same slowdown
[11:42:01] <drej> seriously though, this level is impossible
[11:42:08] <drej> ima bout to throw my macbook across the floor
[11:42:14] <decx> there is no objective
[11:42:19] <decx> it's just some rects ;)
[11:42:26] <drej> I REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT
[11:42:30] <drej> i want to hit the shiny rectangle
[11:42:40] <decx> there's a weapon to set blocks
[11:42:46] <decx> the big black square
[11:43:26] <drej> fancy
[11:51:03] <drej> who's all going to jqueryTO this weekend?
[11:51:04] <drej> vladikoff ?
[11:52:56] <BillCriswell> I wish.
[11:54:38] <checkit> So I'm using bootstrap and I've got a form in a modal... Can't I expect a submit button to post that form?
[11:54:56] <ankurk_> *sigh* I so want to go since I live not that far from Toronto but I can't :(
[11:56:04] <duch_kazatel> i might go to the one in san diego next year.
[11:56:14] <BillCriswell> I wish I could transition to auto width instead of having to use max-width.
[11:56:49] <BillCriswell> It's JUST laggy enough to bother me lol.
[11:57:07] <BillCriswell> Only other option is calculating the width on load I think.
[11:57:22] <duch_kazatel> that's what I'd do - calculate up front.
[11:57:35] <decx> dito
[11:58:09] <BillCriswell> I always have this like... desire to not use Javascript unless I absolutely have to, but it just makes so many things easier.
[11:58:18] <duch_kazatel> that's actually a good thing.
[11:58:22] <duch_kazatel> avoid javascript until you need it.
[11:58:39] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/moqeyiyo/7/edit do you notice a very sligh delay here?
[11:58:54] <BillCriswell> or am I being picky?
[11:59:43] <duch_kazatel> there's a small delay, but meh.  depending, it shouldn't be a big deal.
[12:00:47] <decx> works fine even when switching fast between 499 and 501 vieport
[12:01:39] <BillCriswell> decx: You don't notce a slight like... stutter?
[12:02:04] <decx> sure i notice it, but it's not relevant for 99% of visitors
[12:02:53] <BillCriswell> Yeah..  I need to remeber that users aren't resizing that browsers like a bunch of assholes like me.
[12:03:05] <decx> actually more and more people are
[12:03:15] <duch_kazatel> hahahahaha
[12:03:16] <decx> i did some events in a big analytics account
[12:03:34] <decx> people love how responsive sites react
[12:03:37] <decx> but it's still marginal
[12:03:41] <decx> <1%
[12:04:11] <BillCriswell> Huh that's interesting... I wonder if that's all developers haha
[12:04:41] <decx> competitors developers checking out that sweet mobile ready approach
[12:04:46] <decx> first*
[12:06:56] <BillCriswell> I always look to see what's going on if I like an effect.
[12:12:06] <sunbeam> how can I best add a on click handler for an element that's being added after the page has loaded?
[12:12:36] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam using event delegation.
[12:12:51] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam $('parent').on('click', 'child', function(){});
[12:13:02] <decx> dazzle people by writing it all into a fragment
[12:13:21] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam parent should be an element that exists on pageload.
[12:13:28] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: so body can be used?
[12:13:34] <duch_kazatel> sure, but I wouldn't use it.
[12:13:44] <duch_kazatel> bind as low as possible.
[12:13:51] <BillCriswell> The closest, static ancestor.
[12:13:58] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[12:13:59] <BillCriswell> ancestor is an awesome word.
[12:14:15] <duch_kazatel> ancestral is good, too.
[12:14:20] <DrupalStudent> what is difference between ajax and node.js? do i have to know node.js if i know about jquery ajax?
[12:14:24] <decx> static ancestor is like a thing ron burgundy would say
[12:14:32] <decx> unique new york, static ancestor
[12:14:38] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent ajax and node are completely different concepts.
[12:14:42] <BillCriswell> DrupalStudent: node is basically like... javascript on the server.
[12:14:59] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent node.js is a way to run javascript on a machine outside of a browser.
[12:15:01] <BillCriswell> So javascript as a server side language, like php.
[12:15:38] <decx> i'd say stay away from node unless you have some deep native js experience
[12:15:42] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: ok
[12:15:43] <duch_kazatel> ajax is short for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML" - it's a family of techniques and technologies that let you bring content on to a page without reloading the whole thing.
[12:16:10] <zumba_addict> hi folks, what's wrong with this? I'm getting an object rather than the string? https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/5256636793132752b97e when I console.log this.termsLink inside success, it is correct. however, when I call the function from outside, the result is an object
[12:16:22] <duch_kazatel> you don't have to know node if you "know about jquery ajax", but it's pertinent to know why you're asking that.
[12:16:51] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: oh one more problem, I'm clicking inside an iframe
[12:16:56] <ankurk_> *raises hand* Why Node is bad decx?
[12:17:09] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam is the iframe on the same domain as your page?
[12:17:24] <DrupalStudent> BillCriswell:but inside the browser?say we have to display some realtime data for example stock exchange points etc..so if we use jquery ajax or node.js, output will be almost the same
[12:17:35] <decx> never said it's bad ankurk_
[12:17:37] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: yes
[12:17:42] <sunbeam> think so
[12:17:43] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent no.
[12:17:49] <mikeche1en> DrupalStudent: jquery is client side, node.js is server side
[12:18:02] <pachet> jquery can be server side
[12:18:04] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent node.js is one way to send data to a browser.  jquery and ajax is how you would display that.
[12:18:09] <ankurk_> decx: I mean, Node doesn't so hard for anyone who has basic JS knowledge
[12:18:10] <pachet> just to be devil's advocate
[12:18:13] <mikeche1en> pachet: true i am generalizing
[12:18:18] <duch_kazatel> jquery can be, but for this guy let's start from the beginning.
[12:18:22] <ankurk_> *isn't
[12:18:33] <BillCriswell> DrupalStudent: Node would be responsible for serving the data, jQuery would be responsible for requesting it ( normally ).
[12:18:40] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam "think so" - is it the same subdomain, port, and protocol?
[12:18:59] <decx> ankurk_ i only dabbled in it. i'm quite happy to offload server side stuff to my server side developer partners ;)
[12:19:02] <mikeche1en> ankurk_: that is correct however if he doesnt know the difference between ajax and node.js then it may be too advanced
[12:19:30] <ankurk_> well then he should learn basic JS first
[12:21:03] <mikeche1en> yeah i think that was the point being made
[12:22:03] <DrupalStudent> if i am not wrong...ajax is also something i.e data from the server but the requests to the server takes place asynchornously..actually a dev yesterday told me that node.js and html 5 websocket API will takeover the ajax approach of doing things..so it was realy confusing for me thats why turned to this channel..thanks guys for ur answers so far..
[12:22:28] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent websocket's another way to transmit data, sure.
[12:22:47] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent but yeah, AJAX is a way to load data without reloading the page.
[12:25:14] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: no
[12:25:31] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam then you might run into cross-domain issues.
[12:26:38] <krambiorix> hi, i want to loop (each) through all table rows that have minimum 1 input field... Is it possible in one selector?
[12:27:03] <DrupalStudent> one more thing question please....what is actual physiology of a popup in html...e.g a login form in popup window..or showing some content in popup via ajax?does that popup become part of the DOM?or it exists always in DOM and populated with ajax content when activated?Also a form in an html page which isnt appearing in a popup behaves the same as a form in a popup?or internally a popupede form
[12:27:03] <DrupalStudent> will be different?and will need extra doing from javascript?
[12:27:08] <BillCriswell> tr:has(input)
[12:27:12] <zumba_addict> what's wrong with this code? data being returned to the caller is undefined but inside it, it shows the url - https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/ae6f9a80954b9f5760d6
[12:27:18] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: ^
[12:27:28] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent huh?
[12:27:38] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent "pysiology"?
[12:27:48] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, thanks!
[12:28:03] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent you mean when a separate window pops up from the main one?
[12:28:37] <DrupalStudent> duch_kazatel...no ...say a hidden div comes up..something like lightbox or colorbox
[12:28:43] <duch_kazatel> a modal?
[12:28:43] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Are you expecting Utils.getTosUrl to return the termsLink?
[12:28:47] <duch_kazatel> that's apart of the same page.
[12:28:49] <zumba_addict> yes
[12:28:58] <zumba_addict> termsLink looks good inside
[12:28:59] <ankurk_> Has anyone used FullCalender.js?
[12:29:12] <decx> wasnt there something about 'this' inside ajax?
[12:29:22] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent if it's in the same browser window and not within a frame of some kind, it's in the same DOM
[12:29:24] <DrupalStudent> duch_kazatel: yup a modal...
[12:29:51] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent you can either have it exist and be hidden on pageload, or you can craft it dynamically.  it all depends on your needs.
[12:31:02] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: That's not how ajax works. You would need to work with it in the success callback.
[12:31:19] <zumba_addict> ah, I wrote something like that yesterday :)
[12:31:21] <zumba_addict> thanks for reminding me
[12:31:38] <zumba_addict> i have to remember that BillCriswell
[12:31:41] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:31:51] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Yeah, it's definitely interesting getting used to.
[12:31:56] <zumba_addict> :D
[12:32:00] <DrupalStudent> duch_kazatel:have u ever used drupal?it has a ctools API..oh God..i just get mad to see its js power...popups for multipage forms...popups for all thing ajaxy..so stunning...but these basic questions always come my way in learning js the good way...
[12:32:09] <zumba_addict> i actually just wrote one yesterday and I forgot, LOL
[12:32:16] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent nope.  no drupal.
[12:32:32] <zumba_addict> this one BillCriswell - https://github.com/c0debreaker/BrowserLanguageDetector
[12:32:45] <Uhkis> drupal is fun, you can write bunch of js stuff with only php
[12:33:23] <duch_kazatel> "you can write a bunch of js stuff with only php" - that sounds terrifying.
[12:34:02] <DrupalStudent> Uhkis: you are damn right..its ajax framework will stun those used to writing js..its all in php
[12:34:20] <zumba_addict> I'll have to figure out how to adjust the converted code by js2coffee
[12:34:31] <duch_kazatel> ugh php
[12:34:47] <mikeche1en> basically its prewritten addons that you can install
[12:34:59] <Uhkis> DrupalStudent: tbh i prefer writing jquery
[12:35:10] <duch_kazatel> Uhkis you mean javascript :P
[12:35:14] <mikeche1en> most of it is probably done with jquery
[12:36:06] <BillCriswell> function some_functionmaybenounderscoresometimes($maybeNeedle, $maybeHayStack);
[12:36:16] <DrupalStudent> uhkis:yeh u have to...but when needed...
[12:37:14] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent what makes the drupal ajax stuff better than, say, Django's or anything in Node?
[12:37:41] <mikeche1en> drupal just make it easy to install & set up
[12:38:15] <duch_kazatel> i guess i don't see what makes it any better than any of the other frameworks out there.
[12:38:55] <decx> is drupal a framework as well nowadays?
[12:38:55] <mikeche1en> its not better or worse, the right framework depends on the situation
[12:39:17] <decx> i thought the title cms would be appropriate
[12:39:19] <duch_kazatel> it's more of a CMS
[12:39:22] <BillCriswell> I'm new to drupal.. find it way too bloated.
[12:39:25] <duch_kazatel> yeah, like wordpress.
[12:39:30] <duch_kazatel> agreed, BillCriswell
[12:39:35] <mikeche1en> yeah thats probably more accurate although the terms are not cut and dry
[12:39:37] <DrupalStudent> well...Dont know about Django etc..but Drupal as a whole is run by massive php associative arrays...so u can easily add up keys to the array or unset them...and those keys can be any html to be added to the page...and we pass the wrapper to be affected....
[12:39:39] <decx> yea there's a lot of stuff in there
[12:39:43] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: it just depends what you are doing
[12:39:51] <decx> and end clients can't deal with the cms part of it
[12:39:59] <mikeche1en> if you want to set up an entire ecommerce shop drupal is one of the fastest ways to do it
[12:40:03] <BillCriswell> the HTML it puts out is way too bloated as well for my taste.
[12:40:30] <duch_kazatel> yeah i can't find any time drupal would be more appropriate than, say, wordpress.  and that's if you HAVE to use a CMS in PHP
[12:40:36] <decx> i did an ecommerce drupal site years ago and it was a pain
[12:40:41] <mikeche1en> i can appreciate that although in many practical situations it does not matter
[12:40:51] <duch_kazatel> yeah if you want easy ecommerce in PHP use magento.
[12:40:55] <BillCriswell> I have to create node--foo-bar-baz--foo.tpl.php to override certain html.
[12:41:13] <decx> or for no hassle stripe
[12:41:16] <mikeche1en> decx: there is a great "drupal commerce" module now and an installation profile
[12:41:19] <duch_kazatel> yeah bingo.
[12:41:22] <mikeche1en> magento blech
[12:41:39] <BillCriswell> The only way I'd use magento is if I was selling millions.
[12:41:41] <DrupalStudent> Drupal is more a CMF than a cms...but its learning curve is steep..as DECX said...end users find it a bit hard..developers love it
[12:41:53] <decx> i have to use oxid in the german market, you'll think magento is beautiful by comparison
[12:41:58] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent then why do they call it a CMS?
[12:42:00] <mikeche1en> magento tries to upsell you addon modules
[12:42:04] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nah, only good for small shops.
[12:42:14] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Magento?
[12:42:17] <mikeche1en> im sure each commerce platform has its strengths though
[12:42:17] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[12:42:30] <duch_kazatel> we dried to use magento for a small one off project - magento was great if you wanted exactly what it gave you.
[12:42:34] <duch_kazatel> extending it was a PITA.
[12:42:37] <duch_kazatel> like everything PHP.
[12:43:00] <decx> the main benefits are stock management
[12:43:06] <mikeche1en> the nice thing about drupal is it has a ton of user contributed modules for free
[12:43:30] <mikeche1en> support for a dozen different payment systems
[12:43:52] <mikeche1en> with magento you will pay $100-200+ for each of those
[12:43:58] <BillCriswell> I did ecommerce for 6 years. I'd use Shopify for something small until I outgrew it. It's so easy to get a store up and running with that.
[12:44:04] <duch_kazatel> not in our case, mikeche1en
[12:44:31] <YokoBR> maybe here
[12:44:36] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: thats good if you were able to avoid the for-pay modules, what payment processor did you use?
[12:44:36] <BillCriswell> I think Magento is for larger sites when you have a really nice budget to get things done.
[12:44:50] <YokoBR> hey guys, i'm getting a conflict between jquery-ui and jquery
[12:44:55] <DrupalStudent> how many of u know about Drupal's view module?to me it is the only difference between Drupal and any other platforms in PHP world..just google "VIEWS" and it will be on top..i mean the Drupal module..Also the panels module is for layouts...these two are architects of a PHP genius known as earl miles...and those of you who have been doing php and jquery ..they will just be amazed to see these
[12:44:55] <DrupalStudent> two gems of Drupal...Regarding Drupal commerce..it is driven by RULES module..which is a gem in its own..so Drupal is tough initially for newbies..specially those coming from Wordpress but then it becomes a huge timesaver and extensible
[12:44:57] <duch_kazatel> mikeche1en we had to hand-roll a lot of stuff to get everything to play nice with our backend.
[12:45:03] <mikeche1en> i just dont like using non-floss software
[12:45:35] <duch_kazatel> mikeche1en when you're as big as we are, you don't have that luxury all the time :)
[12:45:41] <mikeche1en> DrupalStudent: yeah views and rules are very helpful
[12:45:52] <duch_kazatel> DrupalStudent you realize us going to google and searching "views" won't return the same thing as it does for you?
[12:45:59] <BillCriswell> I can't stand the HTML drupal puts out.
[12:46:02] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: yeah i mean if you have the budget to do stuff by hand, that is great
[12:46:08] <BillCriswell> If it wasn't for that I could probably live with it.
[12:46:28] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: that probably depends on the theme though
[12:46:50] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: We use omega here for most projects.
[12:47:08] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell meh, it's still a hefty PHP CMS.  like all the others.  'swhy i prefer using something like Django.  the default can be a little bloated, but it's super easy to remove/replace modules.
[12:47:18] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: hmm what is that?
[12:47:29] <decx> i like static site gen
[12:47:32] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR what's the conflict?
[12:47:36] <BillCriswell> https://drupal.org/project/omega
[12:47:40] <xMopxShell> is anyone familiar with google analytics?
[12:47:47] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ xMopxShell
[12:47:47] <b-ot> xMopxShell: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:47:52] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: django is good if you have the development resources
[12:48:06] <duch_kazatel> mikeche1en django was built explicitly because people didn't have dev resources.
[12:48:19] <YokoBR> duch_kazatel, i'm using jquery-ui-1.9.1 and a packed jquery 1.2.6... they are conflicting somehow
[12:48:21] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I used to do things in code igniter... I mostly do just front-end now. Pretty happy about that.
[12:48:28] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: ah cool, and you still dont like the html output? what is wrong with it
[12:48:32] <duch_kazatel> it's extremely fast to get your admin up and running to people can start pumping in content.
[12:48:45] <gnarf> YokoBR: you realize that jQuery 1.2.6 is ancient yeah?
[12:48:47] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell aaaah, yeah.  i'm looking to get on my first node app./
[12:48:56] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR update your copy of jquery.
[12:49:04] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: its all relative, i can set up a drupal ecommerce site without touching a single line of code
[12:49:10] <YokoBR> yep, but it seems that my carrousel isn't compatible with newer versions
[12:49:18] <duch_kazatel> YokoBR then update the carousel.
[12:49:28] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: I like really minimal html, this seems to have extra wrapping for everything.
[12:49:35] <gnarf> YokoBR: thats no excuse to use a 6 year old build of jQuery - update
[12:49:38] <duch_kazatel> mikeche1en eh, I'd still argue that drupal isn't a good solution, but if it works for you.
[12:49:54] <BillCriswell> Wow we really got offf topic here lol
[12:49:54] <duch_kazatel> all right i gotta head out on lunch.  enjoy folks.
[12:50:37] <mikeche1en> duch_kazatel: "good" just depends on the situation and your needs. being able to set up a full ecommerce site with multiple payment methods and other features without writing any code is a big plus for some clients
[12:51:26] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: yeah if its worth your time you could modify the theme or write a new one
[12:51:48] <mikeche1en> tbh i love writing code but to do it right takes time
[12:53:10] <DrupalStudent> i dont know about any other cms...but say u have an ecommerce website...and you want to offer discount of 25 pecent on all products of a specific category on a given date for a particular city only ..say 18 march between 5pm to 10pm for London based customers..how will wordpress or other cms do it?
[12:53:50] <YokoBR> the latest version supports 1.2 http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/#download
[12:55:05] <BillCriswell> DrupalStudent: ecommerce specific cms's have no problem with things like that.
[12:55:37] <mikeche1en> im sure it can always be done, the question is how easy/hard to set up
[12:56:05] <gnarf> YokoBR: try https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-carousel-lite
[12:59:55] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: If you're using an ecommerce platform it's really simple, and I can pretty much guarantee it'll be a lot easier for the client to administrate.
[13:00:01] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: http://i.imgur.com/gvskb8q.png screen shot of shopify
[13:00:05] <obihann> I need some help with jquery sort and a li http://jsfiddle.net/xLLpm/
[13:00:16] <YokoBR> gnarf, it worked like a charm, thanks :) But still there's some problem with my jquery code. http://sindifes.org.br/eventos/ < this calendar was supposed to open a modal alert (jquery-ui).
[13:00:18] <obihann> trying to sort based on data attributes, it loops through but doesn't seem to actually sort at all
[13:00:38] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: it depends if that has the features you need
[13:00:40] <DoctorMonocular> I am really, really stumped here--the inputs have values, but when I call html() the values disappear: https://gist.github.com/PeteMichaud/38465b94a9f8448bbe1e
[13:00:49] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: for example, how could you give a discount to certain groups of users
[13:01:02] <gnarf> obihann: jsfiddle being super slow today
[13:01:02] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: There's an option for that in the dropdown
[13:01:07] <gnarf> obihann: how are you trying to sort?
[13:01:15] <obihann> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/xLLpm/
[13:01:37] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: ah thats cool, one of the clients needed a way to sell software keys though
[13:01:38] <gnarf> obihann: >>> jsfiddle being super slow today <<<
[13:02:06] <obihann> gnarf: any alternatives? I can send you a gist of my js
[13:02:19] <gnarf> obihann sure - or you can just explain the approach :)
[13:02:20] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en:
[13:02:23] <obihann> gnarf: http://bpaste.net/show/CgoavXaAKATpt8YoAXiQ/
[13:02:27] <decx> must be your isp, i had no problems with fiddle today
[13:03:04] <obihann> gnarf: calling jquery sort on the individual elements, a, b parameters, then inside the sort performing $(a).attr("data-date") - $(b).attr("data-date") to actually do the sort
[13:03:13] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: ?
[13:03:17] <gnarf> obihann: so first off - jQuery.prototype.sort isn't a method :)
[13:03:18] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: Sorry haha. Yeah then you'd have to dig a little deeper. I feel like shopify does like.. 90% of what most people need very well.
[13:03:23] <obihann> after.sort I chain a .each to loop through and then echo it
[13:04:06] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: yeah it was possible with a 3rd party service, but then they charged fees
[13:04:18] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: in the end drupal worked fine, so why not use it?
[13:04:24] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: Depends though.
[13:04:39] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: I think it's really user unfriendly.
[13:04:42] <obihann> gnarf: its a documented function '=
[13:04:44] <BillCriswell> Just my opinion though. =)
[13:04:47] <obihann> gnarf: http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/arrays/
[13:05:39] <DoctorMonocular> I think it's something to do with the .each loop -- some kind of scope issue, but outside of that score, when I inspect the $new_form variable, the values are there... they just disappear when I do .html() -- what's going on?
[13:05:52] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: maybe i have used it so much that it is all familiar, but i never have trouble achieving what i want
[13:06:24] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: Totally understand.. and I'm still learning and it's not going so well so I am a little biased as well lol
[13:07:03] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: i like the combination of a gui and full developer access, for example at some point we did a CSV import of products
[13:07:42] <gnarf> obihann: thats Array.prototype.sort --- jQuery is not an Array
[13:07:45] <gnarf> though it looks like one
[13:07:54] <gnarf> .get() will give you the real array
[13:07:56] <gnarf> with a real sort
[13:08:23] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: i guess shopify can do that too, but i feel like there were a dozen different features we needed, all of which could be done by drupal
[13:08:37] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, i asked the question: " i want to loop (each) through all table rows that have minimum 1 input field... Is it possible in one selector?" 30 mins ago... Is it also possible to get the lines that have minimum 1 input field AND minimum 1 input field is filled in?
[13:09:16] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: if you can, write better markup.
[13:09:33] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: Would need to use .filter() I think to accomplish that.
[13:09:33] <NoiseEee> otherwise, that business is just going to be hella inefficient no matter what you do
[13:09:45] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, in what way?
[13:10:17] <NoiseEee> class the rows that only have one input, for example, if you can
[13:10:25] <BillCriswell> mikeche1en: Yeah, in the end it's the right tool for the job.
[13:11:03] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).find('input').filter(function(){ return $(this).val().length > 0 }).length; }); should work.. but it's gross.
[13:12:13] <mikeche1en> BillCriswell: yup and i do try to stick with floss whenever possible
[13:12:16] <decx> good lord
[13:13:00] <gnarf> obihann: http://jsfiddle.net/xLLpm/2/
[13:13:09] <gnarf> obihann: comments added to clean up sticky points
[13:13:41] <gnarf> sry http://jsfiddle.net/xLLpm/3/
[13:13:44] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsbin.com/mipocexa/1/edit?css,js,output lol
[13:15:27] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, woow, cool
[13:16:39] <BillCriswell> cool is not the adjective I'd use... but yeah!
[13:19:01] <gnarf> BillCriswell: krambiorix: $("tr:has(input)") for #1 http://api.jquery.com/has-selector/ -- if you want to filter on value of that input, use $("tr:has(input)").filter(function(tr) { return $(tr).find("input").is(function() { return this.value.length }); });
[13:19:10] <Goopyo> http://dpaste.com/1716280/
[13:19:24] <gnarf> though you could probably get rid of the :has(input) on the second example for a little bit of a speedup
[13:19:27] <Goopyo> why is that preventing the propogation of the submit?
[13:19:44] <Goopyo> theres no preventDefault
[13:19:47] <NoiseEee> Goopyo: what is $(":submit") ?
[13:19:49] <gnarf> BillCriswell: protip btw, .is() takes a function and returns true if anything matches :)
[13:20:06] <Goopyo> NoiseEee: https://api.jquery.com/submit-selector/
[13:20:11] <BillCriswell> gnarf: True with a collection as well?
[13:20:12] <Goopyo> I guess I can do a [type]
[13:20:21] <BillCriswell> Never thought to try it with a collection.
[13:20:23] <NoiseEee> lol gross, submit selector
[13:20:41] <gnarf> BillCriswell: yeah - is === "anything in collection returns true"
[13:20:46] <Goopyo> I'm guessing thats the equivalent to *[type='submit']?
[13:20:52] <gnarf> Goopyo: not quite
[13:21:01] <gnarf> but yeah
[13:21:03] <gnarf> * is the base
[13:21:05] <gnarf> which is UGLY
[13:21:07] <NoiseEee> Goopyo: what are you trying to do?
[13:21:08] <YokoBR> it's almost working now, but the modal popup is actiong weird http://sindifes.org.br/eventos/
[13:21:16] <BillCriswell> Sweet, don't know why I always assumed that would just work with one element.. now that I'm thinking about it I don't know why I didn't realize that.
[13:21:24] <Goopyo> I'm trying to globally disable submit buttons for 3 seconds while its being processed
[13:21:29] <NoiseEee> Goopyo: formReference.on('submit',function() { //find the submit button, disable it })
[13:21:54] <Goopyo> is my current code bad?
[13:21:59] <Goopyo> I guess thats another way to do it
[13:22:42] <NoiseEee> Goopyo: well for one, it only accounts for the form being submitted via the button.  and if its a real form / not-ajax, the setTimeout won't work at all afaik
[13:23:03] <gnarf> Goopyo: "input[type='submit']" would be a much better selector
[13:23:07] <Goopyo> right in that case it doenst matter right?
[13:23:29] <Goopyo> i.e I only want the settimeout called if the post request didn't go through
[13:23:36] <Goopyo> gnarf: does that cover buttons?
[13:23:42] <Goopyo> or only submit inputs?
[13:23:48] <gnarf> Goopyo: so button is trickier
[13:23:54] <NoiseEee> Goopyo: imo you want to watch the submit event of the form, not buttons or inputs.
[13:23:55] <gnarf> because <button> by default submits form with no type
[13:24:00] <Goopyo> yup
[13:24:10] <BillCriswell> gnarf: I guess the performance improvement is that is shorts out after it find what it's looking for?
[13:24:21] <fsioe> I have a ul that is placed in a div. The div has to be height: 500px;. Is there any way I can find out the height of the ul? It's overflow: auto; so the ul scrolls. Is there some way to find out how tall the ul is, including what is 'hiding'? Something like $().height()?
[13:24:43] <Goopyo> oh I see what you're saying gnarf. So if it doesn't have a type attribute it can still be a submit type?
[13:24:57] <gnarf> right
[13:24:59] <gnarf> so
[13:25:15] <gnarf> document.createElement("button").type
[13:25:18] <gnarf> === "submit"
[13:25:27] <gnarf> which is why :submit is not terrible
[13:25:28] <gnarf> but
[13:25:40] <gnarf> I would actually do $("input:submit, button:submit")
[13:25:56] <Goopyo> gotcha
[13:26:03] <Goopyo> now any reason the default event is supressed?
[13:26:31] <Goopyo> http://dpaste.com/1716280/
[13:26:40] <Goopyo> Not sure why the form no longer submits
[13:27:41] <gnarf> document.createElement("button").webkitMatchesSelector("[type='submit']") === false tho
[13:27:47] <BillCriswell> gnarf: http://jsbin.com/mipocexa/2/edit not sure this is testing right but it appears the .filter might be faster?
[13:29:32] <gnarf> BillCriswell: it doesn't actually short - but filter and is should apply the same logic
[13:30:37] <BillCriswell> gnarf: Got it.
[13:30:51] <gnarf> it should short
[13:31:07] <gnarf> but if testing .filter().length
[13:31:16] <gnarf> .is() makes more sense I think :)
[13:31:33] <BillCriswell> Agreed. I was just kind of thinking about speed for no good reason.
[13:33:21] <gnarf> and BillCriswell : miniperfs suck
[13:33:21] <gnarf> http://jsperf.com/is-vs-filter-length
[13:33:42] <gnarf> 10,000 ops per second on either one seems acceptable ;)
[13:33:44] <obihann> gnarf: was afk for a few min but looking now... thanks
[13:34:10] <BillCriswell> Haha absolutely.
[13:34:20] <BillCriswell> miniperfs = what I was doing?
[13:34:34] <gnarf> yeah - basically measuring one thing in a bubble by itself is never very accurate
[13:34:55] <gnarf> much better to actually benchmark a few runs and watch for "variance"
[13:35:08] <BillCriswell> I was hitting refresh like a mad man!
[13:35:22] <gnarf> but one of them ran "first"
[13:36:02] <BillCriswell> I was joking. Ok cool, good to know!
[13:36:13] <gnarf> switch the direction, now filter looks like the more expensive --- http://jsbin.com/mipocexa/3/edit
[13:36:40] <BillCriswell> I see. Very interesting.
[13:37:16] <BillCriswell> Whole lot of computer happenings going on in there I am sure.
[13:37:57] <gnarf> probably just time parsing that chunk of JS that it hadn't needed to compile until we called .filter() :)
[13:38:04] <DoctorMonocular> ok, I made a jsfiddle for my problem - can someone take a look? Why aren't the values populating in the inputs? http://jsfiddle.net/69FZv/
[13:38:56] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: updating the state in the DOM doesn't change the state of the "html source"
[13:39:09] <gnarf> rather than return the .html() -- try just returning the actual nodes?
[13:39:31] <DoctorMonocular> gnarf: this function actually needs to return raw html
[13:39:43] <DoctorMonocular> how do I update the $new_form stuff, and get the updated html?
[13:39:54] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1388893/jquery-html-in-firefox-uses-innerhtml-ignores-dom-changes/1388965#1388965
[13:40:39] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: basically - using .val() sucks for this
[13:41:30] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: also - returning actual dom nodes is probably better than returning HTML
[13:41:41] <gnarf> you probably don't REALLY need the HTML
[13:41:58] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: http://jsfiddle.net/69FZv/1/
[13:41:59] <DoctorMonocular> I get that gnarf, but I'm using a plugin that's asking for an html string, so I really do need an html string
[13:42:12] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: I'd make sure of that
[13:42:23] <gnarf> basically .html(jQuery) is .empty().append(jQuery)
[13:42:45] <gnarf> it probably takes a jQuery collection of parsed elements and doesn't even know it
[13:43:12] <DoctorMonocular> I don't know how I could be more sure than I am that the thing I'm using (bootstrap popover) requires a raw html string
[13:43:15] <gnarf> if it REALLY needs html as a string, fix the plugin to not be stupid
[13:43:45] <gnarf> sure, raw HTML is a nice option, but DOM nodes is a better interface ;)
[13:43:59] <DoctorMonocular> obviously
[13:44:13] <gnarf> either way, if you update the attributes using the raw DOMElement.setAttribute("value", blah) it will reflect in the .innerHTML()
[13:44:15] <DoctorMonocular> but I can't control what bootstrap does, and they don't want to tie themselves to jquery I don't think
[13:44:27] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: "array of elements"
[13:44:50] <BillCriswell> DoctorMonocular: It is tied to jQuery.
[13:45:01] <BillCriswell> "Bring Bootstrap's components to life with over a dozen custom jQuery plugins. Easily include them all, or one by one."
[13:46:03] <gnarf> anyway - done trying to convince you of the "right way" - You have a solution that works with the "generate HTML from already parsed HTML so that I can generate Nodes by parsing the HTML I just output from Nodes" method
[13:47:27] <ankurk_> Has anyone ever used fullcalendar?
[13:51:14] <gnarf> DoctorMonocular: note that this approach specifically requires not using jQuery.fn.attr -- http://jsfiddle.net/69FZv/2/  -- have to .setAttribute() on the raw element (jQuery paves over .attr("value", ...)
[13:52:16] <DoctorMonocular> thanks gnarf, I appreciate your help
[13:53:12] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. Can someoen tell me why my "linkify" function that appends a class and adds a <span> tag inside of the <li> is not applying to the first one? (the first one is the only one to have children) http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/5rM6F/
[13:55:20] <gnarf> LindsayMac: wish i had time to dig - walking out the door
[13:55:27] <gnarf> `glwt
[13:55:27] <b-ot> gnarf: http://goodluckwiththatdude.com/
[13:55:34] <LindsayMac> lol gnarf
[13:55:34] <gnarf> wow
[13:55:35] <LindsayMac> thanks
[13:55:37] <gnarf> that changed
[13:55:54] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  its a place older site
[13:56:07] <LindsayMac> apparently they let the domain go :(
[13:56:07] <gnarf> used to be a giant image of someone giving you a thumbs up
[13:56:14] <LindsayMac> poo...
[13:56:15] <gnarf> `glwt
[13:56:21] <gnarf> b-ot has a short memory ;)
[13:56:37] <gnarf> b-ot: aren't you glad i told you to forget that now lame site?
[13:56:38] <b-ot> gnarf: yes — definitely.
[13:56:49] <LindsayMac> ha
[13:58:11] <gnarf> i took a chance there --- b-ot is usually a yes bot
[13:58:16] <gnarf> b-ot: how about now?
[13:58:16] <b-ot> gnarf: as I see it, yes.
[13:58:19] <gnarf> b-ot: how about now?
[13:58:21] <b-ot> gnarf: don’t count on it.
[13:58:25] <gnarf> ^ :)
[13:58:34] <gnarf> anyway, PEACE!
[13:58:35] <LindsayMac> b-ot: what are you?
[13:58:35] <b-ot> LindsayMac: as I see it, yes.
[13:58:40] <LindsayMac> lol
[13:58:53] <LindsayMac> so if there's anyone who can help and take a look, would HUGELY appreciate it
[13:58:53] <gnarf> thanks b-ot
[13:58:57] <gnarf> b-ot: thank
[13:58:59] <gnarf> b-ot: thanks
[13:59:05] <gnarf> i thought it had that one
[13:59:09] <gnarf> "I'm a bot you know"
[13:59:13] * gnarf slaps b-ot 
[13:59:23] <LindsayMac> gnarf:  i figured it would
[13:59:26] <LindsayMac> which is why I asked
[13:59:43] <LindsayMac> Cleaned up HTML http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/5rM6F/1/
[14:03:06] <LindsayMac> omg nevermind
[14:03:08] <LindsayMac> i'm an idiot
[14:03:12] <LindsayMac> ignore me
[14:03:21] <drej> OKAY
[14:03:22] <BillCriswell> LindsayMac: I was just about to help haha
[14:03:23] <drej> :)
[14:03:34] <LindsayMac> typo in the class name
[14:03:52] <BillCriswell> LindsayMac: Why are you testing the className in the loop when you can do #menu-main>.menu-item>.roll instead?
[14:04:21] <BillCriswell> Oh or no classNames
[14:04:30] <BillCriswell> Oh you want not rolls.
[14:05:04] <BillCriswell> Are you converting this to jQuery?
[14:05:20] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  I honestly JS is not my strong suit... so I'm really just playing around with this stuff.
[14:05:30] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  thought about it. I'm open to ideas to simplify
[14:05:31] <BillCriswell> Got it.
[14:05:48] <LindsayMac> Always willing to learn better ways to code things
[14:05:55] <LindsayMac> I am not a newbie in coding in general.. just mostly back end stuff
[14:06:16] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell: ^
[14:07:25] <BillCriswell> It looks like you're just grabbing certain links and wrapping the text in a span, right?
[14:07:32] <LindsayMac> Yup
[14:07:43] <LindsayMac> If you want to see the live styled version I can give you a link to the dev site
[14:07:53] <LindsayMac> just stripped it all out for jsfiddle to simplify
[14:07:58] <BillCriswell> It's all good!
[14:08:23] <LindsayMac> :)
[14:08:52] <LindsayMac> Basically trying to catch all of my top level links and add the <span> inside of the <a> so I can do a fun little 3D flip effect
[14:12:00] <BillCriswell> LindsayMac: http://jsbin.com/sifisobi/1/edit?html,js,output here is how I'd approach it.
[14:12:20] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/sifisobi/2/edit
[14:13:28] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  looking
[14:13:54] <LindsayMac> ahhhh... altering a <a> is not quite as easy
[14:14:19] <LindsayMac> adding data-special (or anything) to my <a> tags requires some more backend code. Was trying to avoid that
[14:14:59] <BillCriswell> Not sure I'm following.
[14:17:37] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  you are selecting using the data-special selector, right?
[14:17:58] <BillCriswell> No, just the $(.menu > li > a')
[14:18:39] <BillCriswell> The data-special was for something I Was going to put in there but I didn't.
[14:18:58] <LindsayMac> Ahh ok. wow..I don't know WHY my mind went there
[14:19:04] <LindsayMac> its so stupidly obvious
[14:19:08] <LindsayMac> I swear i'm not THAT bad at this. lol
[14:19:27] <BillCriswell> It's all good!
[14:20:03] <LindsayMac> BillCriswell:  you have helped me a handful of times and i am always very appreciative
[14:20:05] <LindsayMac> so thank you :)
[14:20:17] <BillCriswell> No trouble at all. Happy to help.
[14:20:45] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/sifisobi/3/edit might also be useful
[14:21:02] <BillCriswell> I have to run though, good luck!
[14:36:32] <LindsayMac> heh.. did in 5 lines with jQuery what took 20 lines in regular JS
[14:37:44] <snover> 5 lines*
[14:37:49] <snover> * plus the thousands of lines of jQuery
[14:37:52] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:39:57] <LindsayMac> snover duch_kazatel true. lol
[14:40:17] <LindsayMac> snover:  duch_kazatel that said, the jQuery is doing MUCH more for me than this little snippet :)
[14:49:33] <wunz> is there a timeout in jquery autocomplete from a remote source?
[14:51:34] <checkit> Hey guys, I want to use a data type as a selector... How would I do that if my data type is <elm data-validate="route" />? $('data-validate[route]').whatever()...?
[14:51:54] <duch_kazatel> don't select on data attributes :( it's sloooow.
[14:52:14] <duch_kazatel> $('[data-validate="route"]') if you must.
[14:55:55] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Okay... I want to make a "global" selector if you will.. Where any element with this particular identifier on it is effected. It can't be id="" thought becuase they are form elements.
[14:56:12] <duch_kazatel> huh?  that doesn't make any sense. use a class.
[14:56:23] <duch_kazatel> what are you really trying to do?
[14:57:45] <checkit> I'll try it as a class. i was running into some issues before...
[14:57:58] <duch_kazatel> like what?
[14:58:04] <duch_kazatel> and why can't you use an ID?
[14:58:06] <duch_kazatel> i'm very lost.
[14:58:41] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you can't repeat an ID on a page, so I'm not sure where that came from.  knowing what your end goal is would be helpful.
[14:59:38] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Becuase I'll need it repeated on several times on a page (hence the no ID) and I need the ID for each of these elements for other selectors associated withthem...
[15:00:58] <duch_kazatel> that's why you use a class, then.
[15:01:06] <duch_kazatel> what are you building?
[15:02:47] <fiveofoh_> A useful convention, just for code readability, is to prefix such classes with "js-" to identify them as used for Javascript stuff
[15:03:02] <fiveofoh_> So, "js-route" or "js-validate-route" or whatever
[15:03:20] <phelix> Is it possible to get the value of an element right before a on.change changes it?
[15:03:22] <fiveofoh_> But duch_kazatel is right, it'd be better to have a bigger picture of what you're trying to do
[15:03:31] <duch_kazatel> phelix nope.
[15:04:12] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Your best bet there is probably gonna be something like data-previous-value that you maintain, depending on what you're doing
[15:04:40] <Velveeta> fiveofah_: i thought we were the only ones doing that whole js- prefix stuff :D
[15:04:53] <phelix> If I have a list of questions. and its using a javascript slider that changes the values of the input field when i slide it. I am trying to add up a grand total. depending on what the value of the sliders are
[15:05:16] <phelix> ther are 125 of them. what is the best way to achieve this? I'm having a hard time getting the grand total
[15:05:37] <Velveeta> ouch
[15:05:47] <Velveeta> phelix: how about you whip us up a jsfiddle/jsbin demo
[15:06:10] <phelix> wow that would be complicated. would you mind looking here. http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment
[15:06:17] <phelix> the grand total box is at the very bottom of the page
[15:06:38] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Is each question have a slider, where the value of the slider is the answer?
[15:06:41] <mortal1> gentilemen, I'm trying to initialize my validationEngine, and I seem to be getting an error 'obj o has no method live'.  I'd like to note that I'm not explictly calling live
[15:06:47] <phelix> I had it working before but it was looping through all 125 questions 125 times it was way to large
[15:07:01] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Thanks for the pointer... I should've done the class thing first. Over complciated things when something else I tried didn't work. Sorry for wasting your time and thanks again.
[15:07:01] <phelix> fiveofoh_ correct
[15:07:13] <duch_kazatel> phelix you need a way to bind things - check out riot or backbone.
[15:07:24] <duch_kazatel> checkit it's cool.
[15:07:37] <phelix> what is riot or backbone?
[15:08:02] <duch_kazatel> https://moot.it/riotjs/ and http://backbonejs.org/
[15:08:09] <duch_kazatel> they're MV* frameworks.
[15:08:21] <fiveofoh_> A fiddle would be useful - I don't get why you can't just run through sliders and add up values? There's something I'm missing
[15:08:36] <phelix> fiveofoh_: Thats what I thought I could do
[15:08:53] <phelix> why can't I just do this? Only issue is. When a slider is changed it needs to recalcuate all the totals
[15:09:13] <duch_kazatel> phelix you're saying it's slow because you're looping through the dom, right?
[15:09:41] <mortal1> has anyone ever seen jq.validationEngine complain about not having 'live' when you're not actually calling live?
[15:09:41] <phelix> yah when I had it working properly. since there are 125 questions it had to load 125 qustions 125 times which made like a 70k lines
[15:09:44] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Ah, I see how this connects to your previous question then.  Clever.
[15:09:57] <phelix> to create a onclick function for each question that would re calculate each item on each click
[15:10:04] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Oh god use .on()
[15:10:34] <duch_kazatel> phelix you should just create an object with key/value pairs - key is the slider name, value is the value of that slider.
[15:10:49] <duch_kazatel> when you move a slider, update its corresponding property on that object.
[15:10:50] <phelix> fiveofoh_: what do you mean just use .on?
[15:10:51] <fiveofoh_> $('#containerdiv').on('change','sliderclass')
[15:10:58] <duch_kazatel> then loop through the object and add that way.
[15:11:05] <phelix> fiveofoh_ that is what i am doing
[15:11:17] <fiveofoh_> Then where do all the onclicks come in?
[15:11:47] <checkit> Now I'm trying to figure out how to slide the first character off of a string if it's a forward slash...?
[15:11:52] <duch_kazatel> the "70k lines" comment means something is going wrong.
[15:11:59] <duch_kazatel> "slide the first character off a string"
[15:12:03] <duch_kazatel> you mean remove it, checkit
[15:12:04] <duch_kazatel> ?
[15:12:11] <phelix> fiveofoh_Reload the page now and you can see whatI am doing. It is working this way. just to much code
[15:12:14] <fiveofoh_> Yeah, no way there should be 70k lines involved
[15:12:26] <duch_kazatel> where's the page?
[15:12:30] <phelix> http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment
[15:12:31] <fiveofoh_> http://www.thecompleteleader.org/assessment
[15:12:32] <checkit> duch_kazatel: slice, yeah.
[15:12:37] <fiveofoh_> Heh, just lastlog'd myself :P
[15:12:41] <phelix> I mean on.change not on.click
[15:12:47] <duch_kazatel> checkit you don't want to slice.  just do a simple .replace('/'. '');
[15:13:02] <duch_kazatel> though that'll remove the first forward slash, no matter where it falls.
[15:13:31] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Holy shit man
[15:13:34] <checkit> duch_kazatel: My user is submitting a URL... I need to cut the first / off. But keep the rest...
[15:13:35] <phelix> i know lol
[15:13:41] <duch_kazatel> woah phelix you're still working on that?
[15:13:45] <phelix> I am a php guy I don't really know crap about jquery or javascript
[15:14:00] <duch_kazatel> checkit you could also run a regex - something like .replace(/^\//, '');
[15:14:05] <phelix> duch_kazatel: I had it working. but I am trying to clean it up. It works how I have it now. Just to much code
[15:14:27] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[15:14:35] <duch_kazatel> dude... you're doing this all wrong.
[15:14:38] <fiveofoh_> phelix: for(i = 638; i < 652; i++) { newsec = parseInt($('#sample-change-keypress-' + i)); newtotal = newtotal + newsecond } for one
[15:14:54] <duch_kazatel> I remember you!  you were the one dynamically writing javascript.  i remember this site.
[15:15:01] <fiveofoh_> Javascript still has for loops for god's sake :P
[15:15:20] <fiveofoh_> And yeah, if you're dynamically generating your JS, you...shouldn'tbe
[15:15:26] <Hyperking> Need a small library, very small, to add touch events? want to upgrade this plugin responsiveslides.com
[15:15:31] <phelix> I am using php for my loops :)
[15:15:35] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Don't
[15:15:39] <fiveofoh_> Seriously, don't
[15:16:14] <duch_kazatel> phelix no.
[15:16:20] <fiveofoh_> I have to go to lunch, but this is seriously like...20 lines max in decent Javascript
[15:16:24] <fiveofoh_> Not exaggerating
[15:16:37] <phelix> fiveofoh_ Well enlightenme please!
[15:16:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix your work in php is making the browser work far harder than it needs to.
[15:16:50] <phelix> yeah, this is what I am trying to resolve.
[15:16:58] <fiveofoh_> phelix: If the others haven't straightened you out by the time I get back from lunch I will
[15:17:00] <duch_kazatel> phelix they're leaving - can you whip up a quick example in a jsfiddle with, say 5 questions?
[15:17:28] <duch_kazatel> instead of the hundreds you've got now?>
[15:17:29] <phelix> I can try. Let me see
[15:17:47] <phelix> what about the slider library etc?
[15:17:50] <fiveofoh_> But quickly: one listener that listens to all the sliders
[15:18:06] <fiveofoh_> phelix: You can include jQuery in jsFiddles easily
[15:18:07] <phelix> fiveofoh_: I am just not sure how to do that
[15:18:32] <duch_kazatel> phelix let me show you.
[15:18:52] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/qeQyI3H.png
[15:19:00] <duch_kazatel> that dropdown is where you choose jquery.
[15:19:04] <ZeroBeholder> Got a neat tool I am working on mostly for myself-- steal it if you want. The last thing I want to do is change the color of one letter in each word presented. $('#selector').css('color',$('selector')valueFromAnInputField) isn't allowing me to do so-- and I think it should.
[15:19:06] <ZeroBeholder> http://rustbeltrebellion.com/spritzer-test/
[15:19:42] <duch_kazatel> what is $('selector')valueFromAnInputField supposed to be?
[15:19:46] <duch_kazatel> because that's not javascript.
[15:19:53] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://i.imgur.com/3yVla3X.png
[15:19:59] <duch_kazatel> that's where you paste the link for the slider.
[15:20:32] <ZeroBeholder> The click event is in my document ready. Pseudocode, the actual line is       $('#highlight').css('color', '#' + $('#theColor').val());
[15:21:12] <phelix> duch_kazatel: These sliders have their own .js files
[15:21:19] <phelix> how can I link a custom .js library?
[15:21:21] <duch_kazatel> phelix you only need one.
[15:21:22] <ZeroBeholder> It changes the font color for one flash then back to the starting color.
[15:22:00] <phelix> http://www.thecompleteleader.org/sites/www.thecompleteleader.org/themes/completeleader/js/jquery.nouislider.js?n1xj5i
[15:22:04] <phelix> i need to incude that somehow
[15:22:23] <ZeroBeholder> It is a niggle. I don't even need this feature, but I have been tweaking this or that to get it to work for two days.
[15:22:41] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://www.thecompleteleader.org/sites/www.thecompleteleader.org/themes/completeleader/js/jquery.nouislider.js?n1xj5i put that link where i showed you...
[15:22:45] <ZeroBeholder> Time to tap strangers that may see things I am not.
[15:23:49] <duch_kazatel> ZeroBeholder you mean change the text on a work inside of the text area?
[15:23:50] <duch_kazatel> *word
[15:24:34] <ZeroBeholder> Nope, just one letter in a span that has a distinct ID.
[15:25:05] <mortal1> does anyone know, with jq validation, if there's a way of testing if a input currently has an error? (i.e. red bubble)
[15:25:08] <duch_kazatel> ZeroBeholder where's the relevant javascript?
[15:25:22] <duch_kazatel> oh in the page.
[15:25:23] <ZeroBeholder> It initially gets its color from the css #selector {color:orange;}
[15:25:38] <mortal1> because I'm about to do some hackish selector lookup if not, and I'd like to avoid it
[15:25:42] <duch_kazatel> sorry, trying to parse your question.
[15:25:43] <ZeroBeholder> Yeah, I got tired of editing three pages so I just melded them.
[15:26:01] <ZeroBeholder> I'll put everything separate when it works.
[15:26:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm seeing a single highlighted letter - what's broken again?
[15:26:31] <ZeroBeholder> But, I just want to modify the css to change orange to anything else...
[15:26:36] <ZeroBeholder> Oh it works from the get go.
[15:26:51] <ZeroBeholder> But I want to be able to change the color, and that is broken.
[15:26:57] <duch_kazatel> ah, so you change it and it no longer works./
[15:26:57] <duch_kazatel> i get it.
[15:27:11] <ZeroBeholder> It works, the color change doesn't happen.
[15:27:18] <duch_kazatel> rght.
[15:27:19] <duch_kazatel> i see it now.
[15:27:36] <ZeroBeholder> Infuriating that such a little thing can waste so much time.
[15:28:32] <ZeroBeholder> I want to try it out with an ebook I will read for fun. But, I just want this little thing to work.
[15:29:07] <ZeroBeholder> ...to work first.
[15:30:47] <ZeroBeholder> Maybe I set it at each word displayed...
[15:30:55] <ZeroBeholder> Put it in my main loop.
[15:30:57] <duch_kazatel> what's happening is you're completely replacing that text, span and all.
[15:30:59] <ZeroBeholder> I haven't tried that.
[15:31:10] <duch_kazatel> you need to copy the span and use that instead.
[15:31:50] <ZeroBeholder> Ah, instead of blast and echo-- maybe keep the structure and blow away the html innards of the span.
[15:32:14] <ZeroBeholder> keep more and then the color will stick
[15:32:56] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[15:33:31] <duch_kazatel> did you look at the html panel of your dev tools by chance?
[15:34:17] <phelix> duch_kazatel: Can I use <script> inside the html?
[15:34:30] <phelix> or does it all have to be pulled out and put in the javascript section?
[15:34:31] <duch_kazatel> phelix you should avoid it, but if you don't know how I can show you.
[15:34:42] <duch_kazatel> just get a working example.
[15:34:43] <ZeroBeholder> I have been using firebug at an intermediate level for a long time-- still haven't made the jump to expert usage.
[15:34:55] <duch_kazatel> again, only like 5 questions though, phelix
[15:35:14] <ZeroBeholder> I used it to make sure I was getting the right hex color info out of the input field.
[15:35:16] <duch_kazatel> ZeroBeholder check out the html tab - I didn't really look at your javascript, but I watched what the markup was doin.
[15:35:17] <duch_kazatel> *doing
[15:35:40] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/1/
[15:35:56] <ZeroBeholder> Thanks. At least I know what my problem is now.
[15:36:10] <ZeroBeholder> Now to devise a solution.
[15:36:21] <phelix> yah I am trying to put one category in there the bottom one that contains 5 questions
[15:36:23] <ZeroBeholder> A working solution.
[15:36:31] <phelix> can't seem to get the sliders working properly though not sure why yet
[15:36:34] <duch_kazatel> holy crap.
[15:36:34] <ZeroBeholder> Lots of solutions that didn't work already.
[15:37:03] <duch_kazatel> phelix this is why i told you to not do it this way originally.
[15:37:35] <phelix> Well, since I am using a system like Drupal I didn't have a lot of different options on how to do this
[15:37:38] <duch_kazatel> phelix why are there two versions of the slider lib in your code?
[15:37:41] <Brianna1016> is it possible to share a footer bar among multiple pages in jqm?
[15:38:07] <phelix> I am not sure I didn't notice 2 different versions
[15:38:25] <duch_kazatel> ah nvm css and js.
[15:38:33] <phelix> yah was gonna say one I think is css and other js
[15:38:41] <duch_kazatel> first of all, those you have the same thing repeated in the javascript 5 times.
[15:39:08] <phelix> yes because there are 5 questions
[15:39:19] <ZeroBeholder> Phelix? How dead set are you on sliders? Can you just use radio buttons?
[15:39:29] <duch_kazatel> ZeroBeholder the sliders aren't the problem.
[15:39:34] <phelix> ZeroBeholder: This whole entier thing is already done. I am just trying to clean it up
[15:39:43] <duch_kazatel> they have 125 questions and are calulating a result.
[15:39:44] <phelix> starting from scratch is def not an option.
[15:39:56] <duch_kazatel> phelix you might have to with some of this.
[15:41:35] <ZeroBeholder> Crap dog just puked his brains out on the carpet. There goes my evening. Thanks again duch_kazatel.
[15:41:51] <phelix> lol, all his fault
[15:42:22] <duch_kazatel> phelx first off: http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/2/
[15:43:32] <phelix> ok seems the sliders are working at least by clicking
[15:46:41] <phelix> oh i forgot to include the code where the grand total is at on the bototm
[15:49:50] <checkit> is there anyway to detect whether or not a variable is a json object prior to operating on it?
[15:52:41] <YokoBR> Hi guys... Anybody ever used fullcalendar?
[15:54:06] <duch_kazatel> phelix second, is there some kind of unique ID each one of these gets?
[15:54:32] <phelix> yes it should be there in the html but that is being generated by the php
[15:55:04] <justinkaz_ipad> what do you think of deployed?
[16:01:40] <fiveofoh_> YokoBR: Once, a couple years ago, but not sure that I could help you much with it any more
[16:02:34] <justinkaz_ipad> did you like it
[16:02:56] <justinkaz_ipad> im using it as the bulk of my huge public webservice
[16:02:56] <justinkaz_ipad>  i love it
[16:03:11] <justinkaz_ipad> i was wondering what you thought
[16:04:47] <YokoBR> fiveofoh_, i need to use a custom date format (string) as a date From my dB. "dd-MM-YYYY HH:mm"
[16:05:36] <justinkaz_ipad> can you add custom data types to it? like dates? or maybe just javascript functions?
[16:05:58] <duch_kazatel> phelix so it's totally okay to generate a big old javascript object.  let me try to demonstrate in the fiddle.
[16:06:14] <phelix> k
[16:07:55] <duch_kazatel> phelix http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/3/
[16:08:14] <duch_kazatel> so you generate a big old object like that and update that.  see what I did there?
[16:09:50] <duch_kazatel> phelix now, is your slider init code the exact same for every slider on the page?
[16:10:05] <phelix> yah its the same for every slider
[16:10:11] <phelix> just different ID that I pass to it
[16:13:28] <duch_kazatel> phelix okay, so that'd look something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/4/
[16:15:01] <duch_kazatel> and actually, do this: http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/5/
[16:16:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix see what i'm doing there?
[16:16:41] <gremlyn> wondering if anyone has a better idea for me: I'm making an ajax call and need some way to keep the successfully returned value around for use on the page with other functions that fire off depending on user interaction. only way I can think to keep that value around for future use would be to store it somewhere in the dome, like a hidden input or something
[16:16:43] <phelix> Yeah, thank you a ton. Let me play with this for a bit and I'll keep you posted. About to take of for the day but I'm going to save this and tackle it first thing in the morning. I see what you are doing though
[16:16:52] <phelix> thanks a ton for helping me look at this!!
[16:17:05] <duch_kazatel> phelix of course.
[16:17:12] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn that's totally unnecessary.
[16:17:18] <fiveofoh_> This is still needlessly repetitive
[16:17:27] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh_ it is so far, but it's getting better.
[16:17:39] <duch_kazatel> the idea is all about abstraction.
[16:17:46] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, it seems like it should be, but I can't seem to find a better way to keep the returned value around otherwise
[16:17:49] <justinkaz_ipad> any aimators that can do a solid for me?
[16:17:52] <fiveofoh_> phelix: For a quick example of what we're aiming at: http://jsfiddle.net/ZAL6X/
[16:18:08] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn just use scoping.
[16:18:11] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn have a fiddle?
[16:18:28] <phelix> fiveofoh_: Ohh nice!
[16:18:37] <phelix> yah, I can look at this too. This will def help
[16:18:39] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, I don't since the code for returning stuff is local only
[16:18:58] <gremlyn> pretty basic though, my .post() call gets {id: 1} or some other number back
[16:19:07] <gremlyn> in the success function
[16:19:45] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn okay, well, declare a variable up at the top of your IIFE or whatever so it's global, then assign the data return to that var.
[16:19:45] <duch_kazatel> done.
[16:19:51] <duch_kazatel> that's one way, at least.
[16:20:06] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, I tried that, though maybe I wasn't quite scope right, and it wasn't working
[16:20:14] <gremlyn> I'll play with it some more
[16:20:30] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn a sample of your js would be good.
[16:20:48] <gremlyn> duch_kazatel, I'll mess with it a bit and if I can't get it right I'll put a fiddle together and come back
[16:20:49] <gremlyn> thanks
[16:20:59] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Basically, use javascript to loop through your sliders, don't make PHP generate a line for every slider
[16:21:29] <phelix> yah that is what I was doing. I think this example you sent me will really help me figure this out and get this working properly. Thank you!
[16:21:32] <fiveofoh_> And have one event listen for every slider, isntead of generating code to attach to each slider
[16:21:43] <duch_kazatel> fiveofoh_ did you see what i did with mine?
[16:21:54] <duch_kazatel> i didn't remove the extra stuff, to be fair.
[16:21:55] <fiveofoh_> phelix: If you get confused, read up on the docs for .on() and such
[16:22:30] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/4wD3d/6/ with the proper deletions.
[16:22:32] <phelix> k thanks. I'll disect what you and duch both did and come up with a good solution. Thanks guys! Ive gotta head outta here. I'll be back on this first thing tomorrow
[16:22:32] <fiveofoh_> duch_kazatel: Oh, I didn't see that, I just still saw the old stuff below
[16:22:40] <fiveofoh_> Yeah, that's what we're looking for
[16:22:46] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[16:23:21] <fiveofoh_> phelix: Indeed, and come back when you've made improvements, I'd like to see the nicer version :)
[16:23:34] <fiveofoh_> Also, it will be ridiculously faster/more responsive I promise you
[16:23:42] <phelix> yes for sure. I am always idle in this channel. I am sure I'll have a question or 2 in the morning :)
[16:23:45] <fiveofoh_> (For some value of "ridiculously"
[16:23:47] <fiveofoh_> )
[16:23:58] <phelix> yah it takes like 2 - 5 minutes for the page to load right now lol
[16:24:30] <gremlyn> heh got it duch_kazatel :) guess I hadn't tried declaring the var outside the document ready func
[16:24:35] <gremlyn> thought I did
[16:24:47] <duch_kazatel> gremlyn wait what?  keep it in the doc ready with the rest of your code.
[16:25:01] <duch_kazatel> don't dirty up your global space.
[16:25:04] <gremlyn> oh
[16:25:27] <duch_kazatel> do it in the closes parent scope, basically.
[16:26:29] <gremlyn> hrm
[16:27:35] <gremlyn> ah, ok, I have it scope immediately inside the doc ready function and can access it
[16:27:40] <duch_kazatel> yes
[16:28:23] <gremlyn> I was trying to log to console at the of doc ready, but of course that won't work unless I call an action, in this case on arbitrary on click as a test, to actually see the output
[16:28:33] <gremlyn> at the end of doc ready*
[16:28:43] <gremlyn> ok, good to go, thanks
[16:28:45] <duch_kazatel> okay?
[16:30:32] <Goopyo> Sorry I disconnected earlier
[16:30:45] <Goopyo> so anyway to use this: http://dpaste.com/1716280/ without stopping the  submit?
[16:57:23] <zumba_addict> not sure if I should post it here or in javascript. Is my callback written correctly? https://gist.github.com/c0debreaker/f822ee17a59154ad361f
[16:59:01] <duch_kazatel> what version of jquery are you using?
[16:59:07] <YokoBR> Anybody using fullcalendar?
[16:59:12] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ YokoBR
[16:59:12] <b-ot> YokoBR: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[17:01:02] <YokoBR> Okay... How can i use a string as date in fullcalendar, on this format dd-MM-YYYY HH:mm
[17:01:21] <duch_kazatel> "use a string as date" meaning...?
[17:07:12] <YokoBR> Duch_kazatel, i have a MySQL dB with a strng field storing dates in this format
[17:10:48] <duch_kazatel> can you share some sample code to explain what you're trying to do
[17:10:48] <duch_kazatel> because none of this makes sense so far.
[17:23:36] <sunbeam> how to use an onclick in an iframe?
[17:24:36] <duch_kazatel> is the iframe on the same domain?
[17:24:40] <duch_kazatel> same port, protocol, etc?
[17:25:07] <thoraxe> so i'm playing with filereader and having some issues figuring out how to get the conetnt of the file: http://jsfiddle.net/7b6aC/
[17:25:46] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: no
[17:25:57] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam then you probably can't.
[17:26:06] <duch_kazatel> cross-domain security and all that.
[17:26:19] <sunbeam> hmm
[17:26:30] <duch_kazatel> i told you that earlier, too ;)
[17:26:33] <sunbeam> ehm actually it is on the same domain duch_kazatel sorry
[17:26:35] <sunbeam> yea i know :)
[17:26:48] <duch_kazatel> domain, submdomain, protocol, and port are all the same?
[17:27:45] <sunbeam> Yep
[17:28:09] <duch_kazatel> you want this then: https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[17:28:35] <duch_kazatel> $('iframe').contents() - start there.
[17:33:29] <sunbeam> thanks
[17:33:30] <sunbeam> ok
[17:35:21] <checkit> Am I correct in assuming that I can enable my popover elm.addClass('invalid').popover();
[17:37:18] <danpsy> I have this very simple bit here: http://ideone.com/bMZSur (video_source points to a <source> element in my <video> block).  This works perfect, as intended on FF and Chrome for Linux, IE on Windows (with a slight modification), and with Safari on iOS.  However, on Chrome for Android, this only works if the file is missing, but not if the codec is unavailable.  The video doesn't play and the event is never
[17:37:20] <danpsy> fired.
[17:37:53] <danpsy> I've tried every combination I can think of, any ideas to make this also work for Chrome on Android?  Thinking of using canPlayType as a last resort
[17:43:03] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm trying to understand why $element = $('selector') is more appropriate than element = $('selector').
[17:43:23] <duch_kazatel> it's easier to see at a glance that $element is a jquery objec.
[17:43:25] <duch_kazatel> *object
[17:43:31] <duch_kazatel> so it tells me what methods/properties is has.
[17:43:32] <duch_kazatel> *it
[19:05:26] <zumba_addict> folks, quick quesiton, return this.on('change:isMaintenance', this.notify); The value isMaintenance, is that a variable or a function?
[19:08:40] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: It looks like a type for a namespace on an event.
[19:08:46] <zumba_addict> k
[19:09:00] <zumba_addict> I'm trying to decode my officemate work
[19:09:06] <zumba_addict> officemate's
[19:09:31] <BillCriswell> IT looks like a type*
[19:09:40] <BillCriswell> typo*
[19:09:44] <BillCriswell> fuck man, always that word.
[19:18:13] <BillCriswell> zumba_addict: Actually, it's just a custom event.
[19:18:29] <zumba_addict> yup, I finally understood his code. I was able to recreate it for another event
[19:18:57] <zumba_addict> I'm actually updating a Terms of Service on our frontpage via an external call to a file
[19:19:20] <zumba_addict> this way, we won't have to update our code everytime. We just retrieve the terms of service external file
[19:19:39] <zumba_addict> We'll just tell our admin, hey, this is the new link to ToS
[19:19:42] <zumba_addict> :)
[19:20:14] <BillCriswell> How often does the link change?
[19:33:24] <beachandbytes> Any good way to remove history after an anchor is clicked?
[19:33:45] <Brewster> incognito mode
[19:42:01] <checkit> Is anyone interested in helping me understand why it's better to not specify the element when using a selector by id $('#item').whatever() instead of something like $('div#item').whatever()?
[19:42:16] <checkit> beachandbytes: History.js
[19:42:47] <beachandbytes> the selectors are evaluated in order
[19:43:30] <beachandbytes> div will probably match alot of items, while #item probably wont
[19:44:27] <wa5ted> hoping to pic up some cract work
[19:44:30] <wa5ted> *contract
[19:44:42] <wa5ted> any around?
[19:50:32] <zumba_addict> git push done and pull request submitted! I can workout now! WOOHOO!
[19:52:26] <BillCriswell> checkit: ids must be unique so it's just more to type.
[19:53:44] <checkit> BillCriswell: Does it not have anything to do with the "pointer" not having to navigate the dom to get to div#somthing instead of directly traversing to #something?
[19:55:10] <BillCriswell> checkit: I have no idea.
[19:55:35] <BillCriswell> checkit: Another good reason to avoid it is so jQuery can just use document.getElementById('someId')
[19:56:01] <BillCriswell> If you add the div#foo it will have to make sure it's a div, which sucks.
[19:56:18] <checkit> Right right... Ty BillCriswell
[19:56:59] <BillCriswell> Also, if you change the type of element #foo is down the line you can leave your Javascript alone.
[19:57:03] <BillCriswell> checkit: No problem.
[20:02:03] <checkit> So I need to give a popover a custom z-index cause it's not showing up over my modal. Anyway to pass that in options .popover(options)? - Using bootstrap
[20:04:03] <BillCriswell> checkit: You have a modal open but you want other content to be on top of it?
[20:05:12] <checkit> Yeah
[20:44:07] <pcfreak30> Could anyone tell me how I can do multiple buttons on the left sideon the header here: newsite.mannyhandbags.com. You need to resize the page down to mobile width and refresh to see

[22:44:31] <MACscr> my jquery is rusty, im trying to do a very simple form post when a user presses the enter key: http://jsfiddle.net/8D9fh/2/. 1) the placeholder isnt going away for some reason when you try to enter something in the form 2) nothing appears to get passed to the processor
[22:56:45] <Uhkis> MACscr: line 15 prevents anything else than enter
[23:07:42] <MACscr> Uhkis: ive corrected that, but still no dice on a return result http://jsfiddle.net/8D9fh/3/
[23:14:44] <Uhkis> MACscr: now you're preventing enter ;)
[23:15:42] <MACscr> Uhkis: it works here: http://jsfiddle.net/Uwcuz/675/
[23:16:14] <MACscr> though if i change the input name to something else, it oddly doesnt
[23:16:16] <MACscr> so weird
[23:17:13] <Uhkis> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/8D9fh/4/
[23:18:36] <MACscr> Uhkis: good idea, but it doesnt work
[23:19:11] <Uhkis> MACscr: works fine here?
[23:19:32] <MACscr> weird
[23:19:49] <MACscr> im not seeing a console log entry or it display the html
[23:20:07] <Uhkis> MACscr: that's just jsfiddle api fail
[23:28:20] <Uhkis> MACscr: http://jsfiddle.net/8D9fh/6/
[23:29:30] <Uhkis> MACscr: but you should keep that original serialize since that's how you normally do it
[23:29:59] <MACscr> yep, seems to work back in my actual code. (your earlier version). Thanks!
[23:30:10] <MACscr> i hate it when testing frameworks dont work
[23:42:18] <devslash> can anyone tell me why this doesnt work ? http://jsfiddle.net/p3sfy/3128/
[23:49:59] <Uhkis> devslash: what isn't working
[23:50:40] <devslash> its not loading the url.
[23:50:54] <Uhkis> devslash: yahoo.com does not permit cross-origin framing.
[23:50:57] <devslash> i want to load a url inside of the tab. each tab loads a different url
[23:51:19] <devslash> is there another way to do this without using an iframe
[23:51:49] <MACscr> sure, just has to be a different domain
[23:52:26] <devslash> i used yahoo as an example but its a different domain
[23:52:26] <MACscr> plus yahoo is horrible and shouldnt be used for anything =P
[23:52:33] <MACscr> then use a different domain and it will work
[23:52:44] <MACscr> he just told you why
[23:52:58] <devslash> so theres no way?
[23:53:18] <MACscr> why what?
[23:53:30] <MACscr> what you want to do will work, just not with that domain
[23:53:41] <devslash> the url is sonys site
[23:53:48] <devslash> same error
[23:55:38] <motaka2> why this code can't be done by using String.test ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/7077848/
