[08:19:57] <Corbit> Hi. I have more of an CSS question, but I think it can only be solved with jQuery (or later CSS4). Please look at https://i.imgur.com/ubAyBJz.jpg
[08:19:58] <Corbit> The wysiwyg editor widget creates an extra div, that invalidates the hierarchy for the css selector. So the second .invalid-feedback never gets display: block applied. What do?
[11:00:57] <shoky> Corbit: you could add .form-control class to the editor, if that doesnt cause visual changes.  otherwise you can add a css selector like:   .was-validated .trumbowyg-box.is-invalid ~ .invalid-feedback
[11:01:21] <shoky> in either case you'd need  is-invalid class to be added to the editor div , when invalid..
[11:03:14] <shoky> actually no need to add a css selector or form-control class.   just need the is-invalid class i believe
[11:21:52] <Corbit> shoky: Woah! Thanks. Didn't thought of this way! Just need to find a way to hook into the javascript that validates the field and is adding this is-invalid class. Thanks again!

[18:40:54] <grid-> since i used scrolly (line 126 till 129) i'm not able to adjust the jquery $("#footer_filter1").val("Developer");
[18:41:14] <grid-> it's just in the dom, why it can't be set with val() ?
[18:41:32] <grid-> i set it with line 181
[18:50:34] <grid-> hey robertparkerx
