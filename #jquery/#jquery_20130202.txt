[00:00:06] <DavidSullivan> and take a look at it in console
[00:00:39] <DavidSullivan> all its returning is a true false?
[00:00:41] <DavidSullivan> sure
[00:01:17] <the_dark_knight> DavidSullivan: I heard it is safe to json_encode it.
[00:01:44] <DavidSullivan> but its not safe to eval() it on the servefr
[00:01:53] <DavidSullivan> on the client rather
[00:03:28] <the_dark_knight> DavidSullivan: So what should I do it if I want to send a string from model to jquery via controller rather if I want to send boolean?
[00:06:49] <the_dark_knight> DavidSullivan: granden should I be using $.get instead of $.post?
[00:11:44] <DavidSullivan> the_dark_knight, I always use .ajax but I haven't don any of that in a year
[00:11:50] <DavidSullivan> been outa work for a while

[00:22:06] <the_dark_knight> hi DavidSullivan , Can I ask you one more question?
[00:22:21] <DavidSullivan> u just did

[02:55:05] <b-ot> coldhead: Try It And See
[02:55:19] <coldhead> paste your code on jsfiddle if it doesn't and we can help fix it

[02:58:20] <pallet> what I'm trying to achieve is pass "idname", to the function, and then write it into a div
[02:58:34] <pallet> but I'm not not quite right, can anyone help me please

[03:00:14] <coldhead> instead of val()

[03:00:49] <coldhead> yes brantje, that is what i was thinking of
[03:01:42] <brantje> :)

[03:19:59] <the_dark_knight> Hi, suppose I have a button in <td>. Can I write a method in jquery say - setTDText which will be called like - setTDText(this) And definition of method is - function setTDText(elm){ $(elm).html("check");}
[03:21:01] <coldhead> the_dark_knight: sure, why not
[03:22:12] <coldhead> hi Hopsy
[03:27:32] <the_dark_knight> coldhead: hey it's changing the text of button and not the <td> ?
[03:33:29] <Parsi1> can I load a dynamic (.aspx) page inside another page using get()?
[03:34:06] <the_dark_knight> coldhead: did $(elm).parent().html("value"); and it's working.
[03:35:21] <the_dark_knight> coldhead: I was doing the same thing with spans but with spans, elm was <td> but with <input type='submit'>, elm is the button.
[03:36:08] <coldhead> good work the_dark_knight
[03:36:12] <coldhead> Parsi1: yes
[03:36:40] <coldhead> Parsi1: in fact this might make your life easier http://api.jquery.com/load/
[03:36:50] <coldhead> convenience method for load()ing data
[03:36:53] <coldhead> into a page
[03:37:09] <Parsi1> coldhead: I have a problem, i'm trying to load it and show in modal windows
[03:37:31] <Parsi1> I explained the problem here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14661222/loading-aspx-page-with-ajax-as-modal-window , it does not load it properly
[03:38:48] <coldhead> Parsi1: when you .get() some html it doesn't run the <script> tags inside that file
[03:38:53] <fattest> hello
[03:38:55] <coldhead> which is why your editor isn't working
[03:39:26] <coldhead> you need to move the ckeditor init code into the .get() suceess handler
[03:39:27] <Parsi1> coldhead: coldhead what should I use instead?
[03:39:48] <fattest> i was wondering if there is any good website chats out there, i need a good one. it hsould have reistration and login , acp, room creation by users etc. pllls any1, i need a good 1
[03:40:02] <Parsi1> coldhead: there is also a validation method that is not working
[03:40:06] <coldhead> so when you .get(), you then do modal.open() AND ck_init() or whatever
[03:40:18] <coldhead> yes, none of the JS in the .get()ed page will run
[03:40:27] <coldhead> you have to do it ALL in the .get() function
[03:40:34] <the_dark_knight> Hi, http://www.bpaste.net/raw/r969BTan63vA66U3FdxW/ this is my code snippet. I wan't to put single quotes around response.senderId. How do I do that?
[03:40:58] <Parsi1> coldhead: I have lots of JS :/ isn't there any method that works with JS?
[03:41:51] <coldhead> Parsi1: if you can move all that JS into a file you can use .getScript to fetch and run it in one hit
[03:41:59] <coldhead> ?getScript
[03:41:59] <bot-t> jQuery.getScript(url, [success]): Load a JavaScript file from the server using a GET HTTP request, then execute it. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript/
[03:42:48] <fattest> i was wondering if there is any good website chats out there, i need a good one. it hsould have reistration and login , acp, room creation by users etc. pllls any1, i need a good 1
[03:42:53] <coldhead> the_dark_knight: response.accountId + ", \"" + response.senderId + "\")'> ?
[03:43:27] <the_dark_knight> coldhead: way ahead of you.
[03:43:56] <the_dark_knight> coldhead: actually I put \ in after onclick=.
[03:44:11] <coldhead> good work!
[03:45:06] <fattest> ?
[03:47:27] <coldhead> apparently no one has any recommendations, fattest. why don't you see what you can find on google and ask here later when it's busier
[03:47:47] <fattest> coldhead: ok
[03:48:59] <brantje> coldhead
[03:49:03] <brantje> i'm doing this
[03:49:16] <brantje> $('#msg-'+ twid).find('.class').get(0).attr('src','img/retweet_on.png')
[03:49:28] <brantje> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLImageElement> has no method 'attr'
[03:49:40] <brantje> How can i change the src?
[03:49:54] <coldhead> don't use get()
[03:50:00] <coldhead> that returns the actual dom element
[03:50:06] <coldhead> so you can't use any jquery stuff
[03:50:12] <brantje> ahh
[03:50:14] <coldhead> you probably want .eq(0)
[03:51:15] <brantje> like this $('#msg-'+ twid).find('.class').eq(0).attr('src','img/retweet_on.png')
[03:52:03] <brantje> Doesnt work
[03:55:59] <coldhead> i can't see your HTML so i don't know why it's failing
[03:56:16] <coldhead> we've got 4 minutes
[03:56:35] <coldhead> do you even need .eq()?
[03:57:05] <techask> can anyone help me with the usag eof pagers??
[03:58:12] <techask> I want to use multiple pagers into my webpage in this link: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/pager.php
[03:59:46] <coldhead>   i want to be an astronaut
[04:01:09] <Whirl3d_> if I use ajax through jquery to load a php script and in my success handler, I add the returned data to the dom using $("elem").html(data);.....with the php scripts do their thing or will it treat them as just plain text
[04:03:06] <pYr0x> hi guys... is there any solution to completely disabeld the jQuery Mobile's navigation model
[04:03:56] <coldhead> Whirl3d_: the PHP stuff that runs on the server should stil run on the server
[04:04:03] <Whirl3d_> I'm thinking about using jquery BBQ to handle the navigation on my WordPress site so I don't have to redraw the page constantly. I am trying to figure out if I ajax one of the templates, and attach it to the dom, will it load the pieces it needs, perform the query and output the content?
[04:04:16] <coldhead> the server just sees a request, it doesn't know if it's AJAX or a regular GET request
[04:04:50] <Whirl3d_> okay, then why isn't wordpress done with a jquery front end by default?
[04:05:04] <Whirl3d_> thanks for your help, coldhead
[04:05:19] <coldhead> because the world isn't ready for all ajax all the time yet
[04:05:28] <coldhead> esp. browsers without JS aren't ready for that
[04:05:39] <coldhead> and crawlers aren't very ajaxy
[04:06:44] <Whirl3d_> got ya. All stuff I could care less about but I can see where people would.
[04:07:43] <techask> I want to use multiple pagers into my webpage in this link: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/pager.php
[04:08:52] <Whirl3d_> techask, so what's stopping ya?
[04:10:03] <techask> I want number slideshow insteast of that .
[04:10:10] <techask> *instead
[04:10:44] <Whirl3d_> number slideshow?
[04:11:20] <brantje> $('.msg-'+ twid).find('.retweet').eq(0).attr('src','img/retweet_on.png') > updates only one element, but i have multiple of them, how can i set the others?
[04:12:13] <Whirl3d_> .eq(0) selects one
[04:12:26] <brantje> a so just remove it
[04:12:28] <brantje> thanks
[04:13:44] <techask> I mean auto pagiantion for slideshow
[04:14:26] <coldhead> why were you even using eq() :)
[04:14:55] <Whirl3d_> look further down the page to find Custom Template and you can use numbers for pagination....techask
[04:16:00] <techask> but its nt automatic
[04:18:59] <techask> I think you got what am tring to do .
[04:20:54] <Whirl3d_> but data-cycle-timeout=2000 and it will auto cycle...by setting it to 0 it doesn't cycle
[04:21:08] <Whirl3d_> *put
[04:21:55] <techask> ok. let me try
[04:24:07] <techask> can u check this?: http://jsfiddle.net/UA4XG/1/
[04:25:35] <Whirl3d_> where's your jquery?
[04:26:50] <Whirl3d_> just because you load the cycle class and you have your div's setup with the correct data in them doesn't get the thing started. You have to include the command that says, "Make this a slideshow"
[04:27:27] <Parsi1> coldhead:I'm using  $.getScript("../js/PageForMenuScripts.js", function (data, textStatus, jqxhr) {alert(textStatus);)};
[04:27:32] <Parsi1> but nothing happens!
[04:29:19] <Whirl3d_> actually, I just read the docs for cycle2 and you just have to include the script (bad idea, in my opinion). But you only included the css, not the cycle plugin
[04:29:39] <coldhead> Parsi1: i don't think those arguments work with getScript. try putting an alert('hello') in the .js you're getScripting
[04:30:37] <Parsi1> coldhead: even that does not work
[04:31:37] <coldhead> maybe the URL you're requesting is wrong
[04:31:52] <coldhead> check the network tab in your debugger to see if the correct file is being found
[04:31:56] <coldhead> you want a 200 OK
[04:32:01] <coldhead> or something
[04:42:28] <techask> whir13d: yeh , i hv included  nw
[04:42:39] <techask> bt still no result
[04:48:53] <dersand> if i have .add('p') will the paragraph go to the children of my selector or what?
[04:52:27] <dersand> will the paragraph of $('div').add('p') go to the chidren of the div?
[04:59:52] <techask> anyone look at this link http://jsfiddle.net/UA4XG/15/and say me how to give auto  pagination ??
[05:13:16] <pYr0x> i have a problem with the jquery mobile navigation model.... i disabeld $.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false AND $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = false; but if i have an URL linke this<a href="/canjs/index.html#about/julian" data-transition="slide">---</a> jquery will allways call an ajax event... why
[05:13:28] <cTn> hi guys, i was wondering, now when the .toggle() function for toggling multiple handlers has been deprecated, what is the "proper" way to toggle multiple handlers on a link ?
[05:17:38] <fs3i> Hey Guys! I got a strange problem with jquery-ui and the internet explorer 8. When I embed a datepicker I can select dates, but I cannot change the moth, wehen I click the buttons *nothing* happens. Demo: http://terminxpert.de/demo/
[05:18:02] <fs3i> What am I doing wrong and how can i fix the problem=
[05:19:30] <Whirl3d> techask, you need to learn how to use jsfiddle.
[05:19:51] <Whirl3d> Once you ahve included your resources (good job by the way) you need to select the jquery platform as well.
[05:20:23] <Whirl3d> and then you need to include some content to cycle
[05:24:05] <fs3i> II might've found the problem. When I use the Deverloper tools of IE 8 the following code is produced:
[05:24:18] <fs3i> <A class="ui-datepicker-prev ui-corner-all ui-state-disabled" title=Prev><SPAN class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-w">Prev</SPAN></A>
[05:24:54] <fs3i> IIn chrome this is the result:
[05:24:56] <fs3i> <a class="ui-datepicker-prev ui-corner-all" data-handler="prev" data-event="click" title="Prev"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-w">Prev</span></a>
[05:25:24] <fs3i> so there are no data-attributes in IE8...
[05:26:24] <fs3i> And this is thre result of IE10
[05:26:24] <fs3i> <a title="Prev" class="ui-datepicker-prev ui-corner-all" data-event="click" data-handler="prev"><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-circle-triangle-w">Prev</span></a>
[05:31:30] <techask> whirl3d: yup!doin tht only .
[05:34:42] <techask> @whirl3d:do we have any pagination plugin to add for auto pagination ??
[05:36:42] <kennen> Hi, i have a question. i created a div element with the jquery mouseleave event. The content of the div is a checkobx but if i hover the checkbox with my mouse the mouseleave event get called? how can i fix this?
[05:37:01] <Whirl3d> techask, I don't know what you are asking.
[05:37:50] <techask> like cycle plugin for slideshow,  do we have pagination plugin for pagers?
[05:38:04] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I have a table with 3 columns. col1->id, col2->name, col3->button to edit row. When clicked on edit button I get a dialogue box. With this dialoge box I edit the values from the columns 1 and 2. After the controller has returned the response to the jquery I will do $(this).closest("tr").html("updated tds"). Is this a good practice.
[05:41:15] <fs3i> I'm not an expert, but I think that it is better if you update every td, because it is more readable. And if you cange your code, for example if you write <td class="row"> Instead of just <td> you need to update the javascript as well. If you just exchange the inner HTML of the <td> elements, this is not a problem.
[05:42:10] <Whirl3d> the_dark_knight, I personally don't like modal dialog boxes for modifying content. Can you do it directly in the table?
[05:43:28] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: no. are you saying like edit button for each <td>?
[05:44:08] <Whirl3d> I'm saying make the input boxes for each td with no boundaries so they look like they aren't input boxes. If a user clicks on them, they can modify the content
[05:44:32] <c00kiemon5ter> hey all
[05:45:26] <c00kiemon5ter> I want to .load("some-html-page") but have it hidden, so that I can .fadeIn() the content is that the way to go?
[05:45:45] <c00kiemon5ter> $("#foo").load("bar.html").hide().fadeIn()
[05:46:51] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: What about when I wan't to delete the whole row? then I am gonna have to put another button where I will do $(this).closest('tr').remove(). No modal dialog boxes here. But this is a good practice right?.
[05:46:53] <c00kiemon5ter> I more of asking if load() there will try to show the new html and thus resulting in some sort of flickering
[05:47:12] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: Any particular reason why you don't like the modal dialogue boxes
[05:48:53] <Whirl3d> Yeah. It  takes your focus away from your task and makes you focus on the ui
[05:49:16] <Whirl3d> What if I needed to lookup a number, now I got this dang box in my way.
[05:49:26] <techask> plz anyone check thiz: http://jsfiddle.net/UA4XG/51/
[05:49:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5ZCgU/2/  <-the_dark_knight
[05:50:36] <Whirl3d> the_dark_knight, that's especially true if you have just an ID and a name.
[05:51:40] <Whirl3d> It's my opinion that dialog boxes should only be used when it's a do or die situation. In other words, you use a dialog box if you have to stop the flow of the page and the user flow to make them do something or the page doesn't work right.
[05:53:08] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: what about the delete row situation?
[05:53:28] <Whirl3d> put a delete button in one column
[05:53:48] <fs3i> I fixed my problem. no more help needet. minDate disabled the navigation on IE8 (wth? not a really foreseeable behavior)
[05:54:00] <fs3i> But its fixed now, thanks!
[05:55:53] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5ZCgU/3/
[05:57:49] <Whirl3d> the_dark_knight, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5ZCgU/5/
[06:00:28] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: There is no delete button.
[06:00:31] <techask> I need plagination plugin
[06:00:39] <techask> *pagination
[06:02:24] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/5ZCgU/10/ do you see the little X for close (or in this case delete)
[06:04:59] <the_dark_knight> Whirl3d: should I click on Run>?
[06:07:54] <KyleSmith> Hi
[06:08:18] <KyleSmith> Can anyone recommend a jquery image gallery for my photography site? I need the 'view' box to resize to portrait or landscape.
[06:08:23] <KyleSmith> Thanks
[06:08:54] <codepython777> Can anyone help with this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/juddlyon/Q2TYv/10/ -- how do i make it so that the image is maximized maintaining the aspect ratio in the window its being displayed
[06:09:24] <codepython777> KyleSmith: I'm interested in getting one as well. Look at the link i just showed.
[06:10:13] <KyleSmith> Is that your own code?
[06:10:57] <codepython777> KyleSmith: No. Just cut and pasted from the web. But its pretty easy to do using bootstrap. We just need to use jquery to make it more dynamic. Are you good with jquery?
[06:11:16] <KyleSmith> Nope, I'm a total noob.
[06:11:42] <lil-murph> If I make a Deferred object( var foo = $.Deferred) , and then i do something like (var bar = $.ajax(...)) is there a method to make foo resolve/reject when bar does?
[06:11:47] <codepython777> KyleSmith: I hope some jquery guru can help us :)

[07:40:20] <amh345> i've been struggling with this ajax function for a couple of days now. i have an .ajaxStart/ajaxComplete on a loading animation for a form submission. problem is that ajaxComplete runs during the "wait for page to load" result in the browser.  so if there is a lag or something, the load screen disappears exposing what's behind it.  i attempted to set a long timeout to basically force the loading animation to run until the
[07:40:21] <amh345> page exits…  but then it still runs for that long timeout if the form is invalid and rerenders.  does anyone know how to control this a bit better?  http://jsfiddle.net/qchzW/
[08:00:46] <KyleSmith> Does anyone use jquery lightbox?
[08:02:26] <KyleSmith> If you got to my site: http://kylesmithphotography.me/ and click the first image, and keep clicking next. It plays 1-5 but after 5 it repeats image 5.
[08:04:17] <KyleSmith> lmfao my bad
[08:04:18] <KyleSmith> sorry
[08:05:12] <KyleSmith> I should be embarrased! ;p
[08:23:31] <HarryPitfall> amh345: in your ajaxComplete, instead just stop the animation, do a timeout to stop the animation... delay it to run after the browser finish all the work
[08:24:01] <HarryPitfall> most of time, just a timeout(stopanimation, 100) is enough

[09:03:14] <DavidSullivan> trying to do a little survey for a bug with ui.button
[09:06:15] <jugglinmike> DavidSullivan: for accessibility, you'll want to either place the input element inside the label element, or declare a "for" attribute on the label that matches the input's ID
[09:08:28] <losted> Hello all, I'm trying to use jQuery UI (sortable/draggable/tabs) just like the demo at http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists-through-tabs .. the demo is not working but I managed to make it work on a local html file but when importing the code to WordPress the list items are not able to get dropped into tabs. no error from the console, same code as my html file. Does anyone experienced similar problem before?
[09:10:30] <DavidSullivan> jugglinmike, am aware of that. butting the input inside the label is not supported by .button
[09:10:50] <DavidSullivan> anyone have ie that can run these tests for me? http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test/2

[09:26:27] <DavidSullivan> thisboy, you want to add a handler to the window resize http://api.jquery.com/resize/

[09:37:46] <losted> DavidSullivan: were you able to have a look at my site?
[09:53:37] <BabySuperman> Is there a way to automatically apply $('.myclass').click... type stuff to dom elements added via get AUTOMATICALLY?
[09:54:46] <discorpia> BabySuperman: yes, what you want to do is called "live binding" if i understand you correctly
[09:54:57] <BabySuperman> discorpia, ahhh!  tyvm :D
[09:55:13] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, see ?on
[09:55:14] <bot-t> BabySuperman, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:55:15] <discorpia> BabySuperman: you can use .on() for that.   $(document).on('click', '.myclass', function(e) { ..... });
[09:55:35] <BabySuperman> kk
[09:55:40] <BabySuperman> I want to do it with droppable
[09:55:43] <discorpia> BabySuperman: that will make the click function active for any element matching .myclass even if it was added via ajax or similar
[09:56:04] <discorpia> BabySuperman: same principle =) you can check the examples at http://api.jquery.com/on/
[09:56:10] <BabySuperman> ty so much :)
[09:56:31] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, how are they being added ? are you using some frame work to add them?
[09:56:46] <BabySuperman> DavidSullivan, no just $.get
[09:57:12] <DavidSullivan> have you looked at any of the frameworks? backbone.js is pretty good
[09:57:31] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, take a min to go through the tuts for that
[09:57:47] <BabySuperman> im pretty busy, ty though DavidSullivan
[09:59:22] <hateIE> $('html').click(function(e){}); ... using that for a global click handler but if its an iframe it wont trigger .. ?? what would work .. '#iframe html' ?
[10:00:05] <DavidSullivan> hateIE, nope it wont
[10:00:14] <DavidSullivan> you will need to do it again for the iframe
[10:00:30] <DavidSullivan> they wont bubble up to the parent like other elements
[10:00:43] <TvL2386> guys, if you have on('click') listener and you trigger the click with jQuery(selector).trigger('click'). Is it supposed not to work?
[10:01:04] <TvL2386> and with not work, I mean the first on('click') listener
[10:02:08] <DavidSullivan> can someone run the follow perf test for me in ie\safari? http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test/2
[10:03:06] <DavidSullivan> TvL2386, see ?demo
[10:03:06] <bot-t> TvL2386, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:03:41] <DavidSullivan> I hate that description. if it were a (WORKING) demo I would know how to do it
[10:04:16] <TvL2386> lol! Thanks DavidSullivan
[10:04:51] <BabySuperman> discorpia, So I just got it to work with 'click' but with 'droppable' it's not working...
[10:05:47] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, no it wont most likely
[10:05:48] <StephenS> I have one question related to the ajax
[10:06:14] <StephenS> when I call php script with post, and I show it on index.php from ajax/script.php images are working, but tooltip is not working.
[10:06:17] <DavidSullivan>  you need to parse the resulting html and apply your changes to it then add it to the dom
[10:06:50] <StephenS> Title is as usual normal title. I included tooltip script and css into ajax/script.php and srill nothing, even though when I check it without post request on direct url its working, on direct showing is not working
[10:08:37] <thisboy> DavidSullivan: sorry I got disconnected
[10:09:08] <thisboy> thanks for the input I'll give it a try!
[10:09:14] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, hence me suggesting using a framework that you could do this type of stuff with
[10:09:32] <StephenS> ANY HELP?
[10:09:53] <BabySuperman> DavidSullivan, meh adding/learning a whole new framework for 1 problem isn't too smart
[10:10:07] <BabySuperman> DavidSullivan, i am definitely going to learn more about backbone knowing its better at this, eventually :)
[10:10:43] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, backbones cool and runs server side and client side
[10:11:30] <DavidSullivan> BabySuperman, see ?newcontent
[10:11:30] <bot-t> BabySuperman, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[10:14:00] <DavidSullivan> not to spam but I could realy use some peeps to run the jsperf test http://jsperf.com/label-selector-test/2
[10:14:23] <DavidSullivan> hopefully in ie 6,7,8,10 and safari
[10:14:46] <DavidSullivan> StephenS, are you using a tooltip plugin?
[10:15:17] <codepython777> anyone can suggest me a https cdn for jquery apart from google / microsoft.
[10:15:22] <DavidSullivan> StephenS, re read it appears that you are
[10:15:38] <DavidSullivan> ?g jquery cdn
[10:15:39] <bot-t> DavidSullivan, Download jQuery | jQuery - http://jquery.com/download/
[10:16:16] <codepython777> DavidSullivan: Was that for me?
[10:16:20] <DavidSullivan> codepal, its listed right there on the download page
[10:16:35] <DavidSullivan> codepython777, ^^^^^^^^^^
[10:16:56] <codepython777> DavidSullivan: My question is not answered on that page.
[10:17:02] <codepython777> DavidSullivan: I checked before asking.
[10:17:14] <DavidSullivan> just use this link
[10:17:26] <DavidSullivan> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[10:17:34] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, I use tooltip css and script only
[10:17:35] <StephenS> not plugin
[10:18:02] <DavidSullivan> StephenS, ok what about the script?
[10:18:03] <codepython777> DavidSullivan: My question again: " anyone can suggest me a https cdn for jquery apart from google / microsoft. "
[10:18:13] <TvL2386> DavidSullivan, I made a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8K92w/ I'm swapping classes on click... when I click 'toggle all' it won't detect the classes with hasClass... I'm doing something wrong
[10:18:13] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, what with it?
[10:18:48] <DavidSullivan> codepython777, so what part of seeing https in the link on the download page makes you think that it is not an https link?
[10:19:34] <DavidSullivan> codepython777, did you not know that you can drop the http(s): part off the link to the script and the browser will automaticaly add it based on if the page is http or https?
[10:19:48] <codepython777> DavidSullivan: I do not want to use any links from google or microsoft. That is the problem. Not https.
[10:20:21] <amaroks_> Hello, I have appended links with classes or onclick attributes, jquery will bind these why?
[10:20:27] <DavidSullivan> codepython777, so 90% of the sites that use the jquery library use one of those 2 but you dont want to use that
[10:20:42] <DavidSullivan> thus limiting the reason for useing a cdn in the 1st place
[10:21:08] <DavidSullivan> the more peeps that link to the same cdn the fewer times the end user has to download it
[10:21:17] <DavidSullivan> thus increasing the user experience
[10:22:03] <TvL2386> alright guys, I am swapping classes on li tags when clicking on links. I also have a toggle all, but that won't trigger the class swapping. I am doing something wrong. I've created a jsfiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/8K92w/
[10:22:34] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, here http://jsfiddle.net/WJv7M/1/
[10:24:23] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, and ajax which I use http://jsfiddle.net/57YLp/
[10:24:28] <StephenS> What it could be wrong?
[10:25:44] <pranavrc> hi

[10:28:05] <amaroks_> anyone to help me
[10:28:07] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, how about me?
[10:28:36] <dent100> hi there
[10:28:57] <DavidSullivan> StephenS, http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/WJv7M/3/
[10:29:13] <amaroks_> How can I bind events to newly appended elements?
[10:29:44] <DavidSullivan> amaroks_, StephenS, you both need to see ?.on
[10:29:45] <bot-t> amaroks_, .on() | jQuery API Documentation - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[10:29:55] <dent100> i have following markup <li data-type="dog cat bird "      - I need to filter only dog
[10:30:12] <dent100> but the problem is i have all data types as a one value in one argument - like in this example above
[10:30:22] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, now my tooltip does not even normal work
[10:30:22] <DavidSullivan> dent100, $('li).filter('.dog')
[10:30:31] <toothrot> it's not a class
[10:30:56] <HarryPitfall> i believe that there is a filter for it
[10:31:07] <HarryPitfall> li[data-type=...]
[10:31:10] <StephenS> toothrot, whaty it is?\
[10:31:16] <dent100> but its on custom attribute data-type
[10:31:23] <HarryPitfall> i dont remember now, but there is a "contains"
[10:31:34] <dent100> looking for something like contains or IS IN
[10:31:56] <StephenS> DavidSullivan, your tooltip is not working
[10:32:21] <HarryPitfall> $('li[data-type~="dog"]')
[10:32:30] <HarryPitfall> dent100: try it
[10:32:32] <ajpiano> .filter(function() {  return $.inArray("dog",  $(this).data("type").split(" ")) > -1; }
[10:32:37] <ajpiano> lol that too
[10:32:58] <ajpiano> the problem with a string match is that it could theoretically be wrong
[10:33:14] <ajpiano> for instance
[10:33:17] <HarryPitfall> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-word-selector/
[10:33:20] <HarryPitfall> word selector
[10:33:27] <HarryPitfall> isn't just string match

[10:33:44] <ajpiano> oh right, we have that
[10:33:49] <ajpiano> hi djQuery
[10:35:12] <codepython777> anyone knows of a https cdn for jquery.tools?
[10:35:40] <StephenS> so no hepl for me?
[10:37:17] <codepython777> or perhaps there is a free CDN that allows for hosting your own files?
[10:41:16] <djQuery> StephenS, have yo ulooked at ?ui.position
[10:41:27] <djQuery> ?.postion
[10:41:28] <bot-t> djQuery, Couldn't find ".postion" in jQuery Docs.

[11:23:54] <djQuery> Drager, divs don't typicaly have values
[11:24:04] <djQuery> just contents\children
[11:24:17] <djQuery> can you be a little more descriptinve?
[11:24:51] <Drager> djQuery: I mean the value between <div id="my_div">VALUE</div>
[11:24:58] <Drager> just text
[11:27:35] <djQuery> $('#my_div').html() should do it

[12:14:41] <losted> Hi everyone, I would like to sort list within tabs using jQuery UI. My demo is working well but when I use it with Wordpress it looks like there is a conflict of some sort where i cannot move list items from tab to tab… Working Demo : http://www.luclapierre.com/jquery-ui-1.10.0.custom/development-bundle/demos/sortable/connect-lists-through-tabs.html Not working on wordpress : http://www.luclapierre.com/test-sortable-and-tabs/ …….. Anyone experienced tha
[12:14:42] <losted> kind of problem before? thanks!
[12:22:17] <djQuery> losted, have your thought of putting some console.logs in there or setting break points
[12:22:59] <losted> Sure I did. I found out that the drop event is not firing up
[12:24:09] <losted> if i change my "accept" parameter to only "li" I'm able to drop tab into tab (the drop event is firing) but it's not the intended result obviously.
[12:26:24] <djQuery> then it is probably your selector for droppable or something
[12:26:50] <losted> its the same selector i have on my non-wordpress demo
[12:27:05] <losted> and "li" should work as my list items are li
[12:33:05] <djQuery> losted this page isn't running the same version of jquery as the last page
[12:34:40] <losted> updated (now it does)
[12:34:48] <losted> not much luck
[12:34:54] <DukeDrake> hi
[12:36:38] <DukeDrake> when using e.preventDefault .... is there a way to check, what "default" would be first?
[12:42:29] <thinkerweb> DukeDrake, lol, the default you code in will be default, no?
[12:43:36] <djQuery> DukeDrake, that depends on the item that e is
[12:43:47] <djQuery> you can test what kind of even e is
[12:45:16] <djQuery> $('form').on('submit', function(e){    var valid = validate(this); if (!valid){e.preventDefault();}});
[12:45:32] <djQuery> DukeDrake, ^^^ is a typical use case for it
[12:45:45] <DukeDrake> yesh ....
[12:45:59] <DukeDrake> buuuut ...  if I tab from one input field to the next ...
[12:46:47] <djQuery> then its obvous that e.preventDefualt would prevent blur in that case
[12:47:00] <dogarrhea> [12:46] <dogarrhea> i need to select all elements whose text matche a certain regular expression and are not links. [12:46] <dogarrhea> is this possible using the "not:something" selector?
[12:47:00] <DukeDrake> hm
[12:47:01] <djQuery> well as long as you are bound to blur that is
[12:47:18] <thinkerweb> jquery ui and mobile are very easy to use, but its not easy to make something stylish
[12:47:40] <DukeDrake> djQuery: there are to things happening: the cursor gets placed into the next input AND the viewport tries to focus the field
[12:47:47] <djQuery> dogarrhea, see ?not
[12:47:47] <bot-t> dogarrhea, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[12:47:59] <djQuery> dogarrhea, see ?.filter
[12:47:59] <bot-t> dogarrhea, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:48:00] <thinkerweb> I don't know, things look cheap, and...when I used tabs, and tried to make three columns inside each tab, they don't behave as I want
[12:48:13] <djQuery> dogarrhea, there are 2 different ways to do that
[12:48:36] <dogarrhea> oh i was thinking something a long the lines of *:not(a:matches("theregex")) but i guess there's nothing like that
[12:48:38] <DukeDrake> it'd be great if it would only place the cursor and NOT try to change the viewport ....
[12:48:50] <djQuery> ?:not

[12:49:18] <daveid> i need to make a form not submit when pressing enter inside a text field
[12:49:29] <djQuery> dogarrhea, but all these start to get slower
[12:49:47] <daveid> i'm doing $('#field').on('keyup') etc, i tried e.preventDefault() and return false
[12:49:50] <daveid> but to no avail
[12:49:52] <djQuery> dogarrhea, I would think that :not would be the slowers
[12:49:55] <daveid> the form gets submitted
[12:49:59] <dogarrhea> oh. i just need to post-pend :not("elementidontcareabout"

[12:51:43] <djQuery> I think form validation is the wheel that gets re-invented the most
[12:52:08] <daveid> actually
[12:52:19] <daveid> you could have just told me i need to use keydown instead
[12:52:20] <daveid> nvm
[12:53:24] <StephenS> djQuery, I still dont understand that ajax auto update
[12:53:26] <StephenS> how fb works?
[12:53:46] <StephenS> If I have 0 notification its shown nothing as pop-up, however when I have one notification its auto updated
[12:53:55] <djQuery> StephenS, what ajax auto update?
[12:54:38] <StephenS> djQuery, that thingy notification on fb
[12:55:18] <djQuery> StephenS, fb? dont know have never logged into it

[12:56:14] <djQuery> or are you talking about the new html5 notifications
[12:56:23] <StephenS> nope\
[12:56:42] <StephenS> I mean, I have info.php and index.php
[12:57:17] <djQuery> StephenS, http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/notifications/quick/
[12:57:22] <StephenS> when I load page by default I check if there is any notification, and if not I display nothing, but if there is, I display notification which is
[12:57:47] <StephenS> not that

[13:50:20] <millun> morning, can i ask how to monitor an anchor for a css change?
[13:51:42] <systemfault> You can't.
[13:54:38] <millun> so i should use some timed observer?
[13:56:26] <grafi> why do you want to monitor css changes?
[13:57:45] <millun> ah, stupid me. maybe i could monitor CSS classes removal/adding
[13:58:10] <millun> i am trying to get UI slider's postition
[13:58:14] <millun> position*
[14:04:14] <thinkerweb> if you redirect your site to a mobile version and the visitor hits back the will find themselves back at the mobile site eh, correct?
[14:06:57] <neataroni> if $(".table_employee_dropdown option:selected") returns an array, how do filter that array by the value selected in each case?
[14:08:22] <neataroni> for anyone curious, use .filter with a function that returns a boolean
[14:15:27] <grafi> so you have a multiselect and you want to do what exactly?
[14:22:40] <djQuery> millun, slide has a callback when the sliding is don
[14:22:42] <djQuery> done
[14:23:25] <djQuery> millun, http://api.jqueryui.com/slider/#event-slide
[14:24:13] <djQuery> look at all the different events there, start stop slide change
[14:24:29] <djQuery> lotsa stuff there to work with without you having to do something weird
[14:49:46] <dersand> how should i proceed if i have a fadeOut() method and should wait like a second before executing another bit of code? like this: fadeOut, delay some, change a bit of code and so on, and then fadeIn again?
[14:51:21] <adamovy> try setTimeout()
[14:53:53] <juan_> there is a .delay( ) function to work with animations i am pretty sure. BUT maybe you should try using .promise( )
[14:54:01] <dersand> there isnt any jquery documentation of that method
[14:54:38] <juan_> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[14:56:39] <juan_> but i guess this could help you better http://api.jquery.com/promise/
[14:59:37] <systemfault> dersand: if you simply need to wait for an animation to be finished before executing code then… most of the animation functions take a "onfinish" callback as argument
[15:18:03] <DukeDrake> it'd be great if it would be possible to only place the cursor with focus() and avoid the change to the viewport ....
[15:34:08] <peepsalot> is there no builtin mousewheel events in jquery?
[15:37:30] <delboy1978uk> can anyone help me with a jquery autocomplete using an ajax?
[15:38:10] <delboy1978uk> i can see my stuff in responseText but no menu of autosuggested stuff appears
[15:39:25] <delboy1978uk> anyone know how the json should be sent back?
[15:41:25] <peepsalot> paste what you've got so far
[15:45:35] <DukeDrake> If I use tab to switch to the next <input> the viewport will try to focus. is there a way to avoid that?
[15:48:41] <bjazz> simple noob question: http://pastebin.com/EMatYzNd  <- why isn't the first element of the group equal to the jquery object returned by selecting it directly by id?
[15:50:16] <danheberden> bjazz: because they are different objects
[15:50:20] <systemfault> bjazz: jquery objects are… Objects
[15:50:41] <systemfault> bjazz: And comparing objects with ==/=== compare their reference
[15:51:44] <danheberden> bjazz: you could check agains the actual dom node, however
[15:52:05] <bjazz> danheberden: systemfault: thanks.
[15:52:06] <danheberden> $('#win_group').children()[0] === $('#win_1')[0]
[15:52:12] <danheberden> or .get(0)
[15:52:17] <danheberden> whatever suites your fancy
[15:52:40] <danheberden> although i suspect there is a way to accomplish what you want
[15:52:45] <danheberden> without having to do these kind of checks
[15:53:09] <danheberden> but i have no idea what your'e doing - just know there's probably a cleaner, less explicit way of achieving the result you want
[15:53:31] <bjazz> what you have said will certainly work.
[15:54:15] <bjazz> bassically i'm trying to pass a jquery object into a function. then loop over the elements in a group and if it matches the arg, hilight it, and if not, disable it.
[15:54:39] <hateIE> just discovered this very useful advise.. http://satyadeepk.in/2011/01/fix-jquery-high-cpu-usage-animations-with-jquery-fx-interval/
[15:59:24] <wilornel> oin #mingw
[16:00:57] <dersand> it seems to me that text() method does not apply delay() method
[16:02:14] <dersand> i have $("").delay(2000).text("some text") but the text always appear before 2 seconds...
[16:03:04] <systemfault> dersand: delay is for the animation queue AFAIK.. not that
[16:03:19] <systemfault> dersand: Whatdo you want to do?
[16:04:04] <dersand> fadeout the current content of the div. change the text, fade it back in
[16:04:59] <systemfault> dersand: myElement.fadeOut('slow', function() { $(this).text('lol').fadeIn('slow'); }); ?
[16:05:36] <roolo> Is there a way to load this http://query.fakaheda.eu/93.91.250.130:27296.feed by jQuery? getJson - bad developer, you cross domaining ; ajax/jsonp - man, this is not good enough json for me
[16:06:00] <dersand> smart solution, i like it.
[16:15:11] <delboy1978uk> what would the simplest autosuggest return with only 2 suggestions with a label and value?
[16:15:16] <delboy1978uk> in json
[16:15:43] <toothrot> eh, what?
[16:15:53] <delboy1978uk> should it look something like this?
[16:16:35] <delboy1978uk> [{label:'blah',value:1},{label:'blahblah',vale:2{] ?
[16:16:46] <delboy1978uk> or is that wrong?
[16:17:01] <delboy1978uk> just tring to get the autosuggest happening
[16:18:30] <toothrot> delboy1978uk, that looks right
[16:19:28] <delboy1978uk> toothrot? as in herman toothrot? :-) thanks ill get my string echoing out like that 1st then cheers
[16:19:56] <toothrot> what pants?
[16:20:51] <StephenS> is there a way while I am on website to constantly keep connection with db and update it from my end with some variable?
[16:21:11] <delboy1978uk> loop it in a timer
[16:21:39] <delboy1978uk> lol
[16:22:08] <StephenS> how
[16:24:01] <toothrot> StephenS, you should probably describe what you're trying to do
[16:24:14] <StephenS> well I have chat and on chat I have off and online mode
[16:24:15] <delboy1978uk> StephenS http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3138756/jquery-repeat-function-every-60-seconds
[16:24:49] <StephenS> so I update activity field if member click on any field, however its not updating if he is on webpage (which I want)
[16:24:55] <StephenS> so thats why I thought to use jquery
[16:25:47] <toothrot> maybe you want comet/websockets
[16:25:54] <toothrot> or whatever the new thing is if there is one
[16:26:07] <StephenS> socket.io and node.js
[16:26:14] <StephenS> but I decided to not use it, I have my reasons :D
[16:27:00] <delboy1978uk> is this json valid? the label part i described earlier didnt have quotes round it
[16:27:02] <delboy1978uk> [{"label":"5643765 52453","value":6},{"labe
[16:27:37] <toothrot> delboy1978uk, it's not required in _javascript_, but the JSON spec requires double quotes, yes.
[16:28:01] <toothrot> http://jsonlint.com/
[16:28:01] <delboy1978uk> so thats really valid then lol?
[16:28:06] <toothrot> well, it's cut off
[16:28:09] <toothrot> so i don't know
[16:28:13] <delboy1978uk> yeah i know lol
[16:30:20] <delboy1978uk> yay i got it working!
[16:30:25] <delboy1978uk> thanks toothrot
[16:34:50] <StephenS> is there any example with live update to sql? I have time() and I need to send it every 1 second to sql db..
[16:46:17] <hateIE> is there a way to know when @font-face is ready?
[16:46:34] <systemfault> It is.
[16:47:00] <systemfault> http://caniuse.com/#search=font-face
[16:47:17] <hateIE> i mean when the page renders
[16:47:25] <systemfault> Ahhh
[16:48:20] <kerozene> hateIE: google webfont loader has some events. maybe dig into those
[16:48:36] <hateIE> ok
[16:49:00] <liam> I am wanting to use this plugin http://jdewit.github.com/bootstrap-timepicker/ but I want to use it with controls that are loaded using ajax… how can I do this?
[16:50:30] <systemfault> liam: I never used it but did you try with the attributes?
[16:50:50] <systemfault> Perhaps it uses event delegation for those
[16:54:43] <hateIE> systemfault.. just learned that firefox does not fire window.load till fontface is applied but chrome and safari call it before its applied
[16:55:01] <gf3> FOUTTTTT
[16:55:03] <gf3> FTL
[16:55:07] <systemfault> hateIE: Hmm, good to know
[16:55:09] <hateIE> so its about using onreadystatechange
[16:55:30] <systemfault> Perhaps we should stop worrying about the FOUT :/
[16:55:41] <systemfault> I mean, for images.. we don't care
[16:57:03] <hateIE> actually chrome firefox and safari are guilty of it
[16:57:14] <hateIE> internet exploere is actually the good boy for once hahah
[16:57:32] <hateIE> f me we should shout that from the roof tops man
[16:57:43] <systemfault> I'm lucky enough to have a good connection so I never see it :D
[16:58:04] <systemfault> Perhaps that should be the workaround :P "If you see a FOUT, get a better connection"
[16:58:15] <systemfault> j/k
[16:58:33] <kerozene> is there any evidence endusers care about fout?
[16:58:57] <kerozene> or even fouc generally
[17:00:43] <hateIE> cant ever say i heard a user whining about the fact that fout annoyed him
[17:01:02] <systemfault> Neither I so far..
[17:01:44] <kerozene> wikipedia doesn't reference jakob nielsen
[17:01:50] <hateIE> chromes solution is superior but still undeseried behavior
[17:07:11] <hateIE> thinking about it systemfault i think we should
[17:07:35] <systemfault> Hmm… just had an awful idea..
[17:08:15] <Eviltwin> I've had some pretty awful ideas before
[17:08:16] <kerozene> font-family: "Hipster Jazz", "Comic Sans", fantasy; ?
[17:08:22] <systemfault> Could you sync XHR the fonts, and at the same time block the browser, to put them in cache…. ?
[17:08:28] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[17:08:30] <Eviltwin> UGH
[17:08:31] <Eviltwin> Sync XHR
[17:08:38] <systemfault> That's fugly, right ?
[17:09:00] <hateIE> the load event should have a standard behavior across browser only from that respect.. if its not fixed chrome,saf,ff are left with the onreadystatechange work around
[17:09:02] <Eviltwin> I think some browsers are planning to (or perhaps already have) deprecated sync XHR
[17:09:07] <systemfault> The idea would be to block the browser… download the fonts.. then resume the same way a <script> tag does
[17:09:14] <Eviltwin> Everyone acknowledges that it's a bad idea at least
[17:09:18] <hateIE> which i am about to test if it even works
[17:09:21] <systemfault> Yeah, sync xhr is bad
[17:10:09] <kerozene> if you're going to use js you might as well just showhide <body>
[17:11:34] <systemfault> kerozene: But when do you show it?
[17:11:47] <systemfault> Since .load doesn't work (From what hateIE said)
[17:11:57] <kerozene> dammit, now I have to look at google font loader myself
[17:12:17] <kerozene> it's definitely got an event for 'x-font loaded'
[17:13:18] <hateIE> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677181/how-to-know-when-font-face-has-been-applied ... look at awnser 20 i bet the google font loader thing ends up using that
[17:13:22] <hateIE> "oldschool"
[17:14:00] <hateIE> or perphaps just a reliable method that been forgoten ha
[17:14:09] <kerozene> aha
[17:19:56] <kerozene> hateIE: it seems to do some tricky stuff with timers and measuring span widths to get info about specifically which fonts are loaded
[17:20:51] <systemfault> Wow :/
[17:21:17] <systemfault> Makes sense… but it's ugly :D
[17:23:01] <trollboy> if I'm doing a HTML5 page, can I safely use non-standard element attributes?
[17:24:08] <kerozene> yes but that doesn't only apply to html5
[17:24:45] <hateIE> i hope later versions of chrome fixed the readystate == complete
[17:25:17] <hateIE> or that really leaves things quiet ugly
[17:25:48] <hateIE> and IE smells like roses for being a barbarian and getting 1 thing right
[17:26:13] <hateIE> jks :D
[18:10:04] <NCS_One> hi
[18:16:15] <grafi> lalalala
[18:21:04] <leaetmika> hi guys I am trying to pass a parameter to a call back function
[18:21:19] <leaetmika>  .fadeOut(2000, function($(this)) {
[18:21:19] <leaetmika> 					    	alert('redirect'+$(this).attr('href'));
[18:21:51] <leaetmika> I think the syntax is wrong
[18:23:57] <systemfault> just put "this" in a variable and use it inside the callback
[18:24:20] <systemfault> var $this = $(this); bleh.fadeOut(2000, function() { alert…… });
[18:25:02] <leaetmika> thks let me try
[18:25:51] <NCS_One> how can I have access to function from a script I downloaded? like this http://pastebin.com/HPkNpcDG
[18:26:13] <NCS_One> how can I have access to _templates and _tmpl?
[18:26:16] <leaetmika> @systemfault Thanks it works
[18:44:55] <leaetmika> hi guys I am trying to reload only part of the page when clicking on my menu it works fine
[18:44:56] <leaetmika> http://jsfiddle.net/RkZvW/
[18:45:01] <leaetmika> only thing
[18:45:15] <leaetmika> it always goes back to the top of the page
[18:45:28] <leaetmika> is there something that i can do to avoid that ?
[18:48:33] <leaetmika> any ideas
[18:48:35] <leaetmika> ?
[18:50:35] <jost> leaetmika, just an idea: Try to return false in your click-callback
[18:51:11] <leaetmika> after the e.preventDefault(); ?
[18:52:33] <jost> last thing in the function
[18:52:50] <m4ggus> e.preventDefault ist in the wrong scope i guess
[19:04:03] <leaetmika> @jost i tried but no luck
[19:04:17] <leaetmika> sent you the link via PM
[19:04:59] <jost> leaetmika, m4ggus is probably right, the calls are in the wrong function (callback of "animate")
[19:05:32] <leaetmika> no they are after the call back of animate
[19:05:42] <m4ggus> yep, the indentation makes it hard to read
[19:06:14] <leaetmika> sorry
[19:06:41] <jost> just copied and formatted it, to me it seems that they are in the animate-callback
[19:07:34] <m4ggus> yes
[19:07:38] <greg5green> its definitely in the animate callback
[19:10:04] <leaetmika> no i can confirm that its not , I added a alert where the e.prevent is and it runs before the animation
[19:10:41] <grafi> well theredefinetely something strange in that fiddle ;)
[19:10:57] <greg5green> actually, not even in the callback, just in an extra block?
[19:11:28] <leaetmika> i tried to re format it
[19:11:29] <leaetmika> http://jsfiddle.net/RkZvW/1/
[19:12:01] <codepython777> is this available from a CDN: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable ?
[19:16:53] <jost> leaetmika, I think the JS is correct
[19:17:25] <jost> the click-event is not propagated to the link, only the contained span gets it.
[19:17:40] <leaetmika> @jost yes I can see the animation working fine but it always jump to the top of the page
[19:17:52] <jost> The problem is, that the content is removed, and for a short moment the page has only a small height
[19:18:08] <leaetmika> o ok
[19:19:05] <leaetmika> any idea how to avoid that ?
[19:23:18] <jost> Some ideas: 1) Define a sufficient min-height for #content .center, 2) load the new page somewhere else, and only replace the contents *after* the new content has been loaded. 3) Before emptying the content area, get its height and set it explicitely to it. After the new content is loaded, remove  that explicit height.
[19:23:50] <jost> All of these might trigger some jumping, if the content heights differ much
[19:24:02] <leaetmika> I see
[19:24:11] <leaetmika> @jost I will try that
[19:24:14] <leaetmika> thanks for your help
[19:28:43] <leaetmika> last thing
[19:28:54] <leaetmika> it is possible to instead of loading the whole page
[19:28:54] <leaetmika> .load($this.attr('href')
[19:29:08] <leaetmika> load only one div of this page ?
[19:31:27] <ini> i have table rows that each have a unique ID. the tbody has an ID - can i use .children() to get the ID's of the rows to add to an array or var?
[19:33:00] <ini> the rows have a class, sort_table, so i tried this : $("main_table").children(".sort_table").each(

[20:09:23] <s34n> I'm trying to understand why dynamically sizing an iframe causes a overflow of the page.
[20:09:40] <s34n> http://jsfiddle.net/QkuaC/
[20:10:42] <s34n> grrr. my jsfiddle just changed
[20:13:15] <s34n> http://jsfiddle.net/QkuaC/3/
[20:17:09] <s34n> I don't get why my content is now just a little bit taller than its container
[20:21:45] <grafi> me neither
[20:22:21] <greg5green> everything seems to be measured right
[20:22:27] <greg5green> and the math is being done right
[20:23:35] <s34n> is there some aspect of an iframe that makes it special?
[20:24:06] <greg5green> oh duh
[20:24:07] <greg5green> border
[20:24:21] <greg5green> you already got rid of the border, nm
[20:24:53] <s34n> hmm.. changing the iframe to a p doesn't have the same problem
[20:25:46] <s34n> http://jsfiddle.net/QkuaC/5/
[20:25:47] <greg5green> i solved it
[20:26:40] <s34n> greg5green: do share
[20:26:50] <greg5green> iframe is apparently an inline elemtn
[20:26:52] <greg5green> element*
[20:27:12] <s34n> oh
[20:27:13] <greg5green> so it has whitespace
[20:27:31] <grafi> whitespace oô
[20:27:34] <greg5green> well, maybe not entirely solved it, because getting rid of that white space still doesnt do it
[20:27:41] <greg5green> but changing it to a block element does change it
[20:28:00] <greg5green> http://jsfiddle.net/QkuaC/6/

[20:28:04] <s34n> thx

[20:32:34] <greg5green> if you are building it on your own, you can reference each element via an index
[20:33:10] <greg5green> like $('#parent').eq(0) would reference the first slide, $('parent').eq(1) would reference second slide, etc
[20:33:19] <JoeHazzers> greg5green: yeah, i did want to build one on my own 8)
[20:33:50] <greg5green> so just on page load, find out how many slides there are
[20:34:34] <JoeHazzers> and just wrap around?
[20:34:51] <greg5green> so you want an infinite carousel
[20:34:53] <eatkin> is there a jqueryui channel or is this it?
[20:34:57] <greg5green> ?
[20:35:07] <greg5green> are you sliding or fading in and out?
[20:37:06] <neataroni> is there a way i can post a form with $.post without having to manually grab the values from the form elements?
[20:38:43] <systemfault> neataroni: You want to post a form?
[20:38:48] <systemfault> neataroni: If so, yes.
[20:39:15] <neataroni> systemfault: yes
[20:39:31] <systemfault> You can select the form and call .serialize() on it
[20:39:43] <systemfault> And pass the result as data
[20:39:57] <neataroni> systemfault: aha- where do i pass that result?
[20:56:49] <JoeHazzers> if i'm doing this slider, am i better off just stacking slides outside the viewport, or actually having a long line of them?
[21:14:19] <greg5green> JoeHazzers, imo, it depends on how you want the slider to behave
[21:14:31] <JoeHazzers> horizontally
[21:14:33] <greg5green> if you keep hitting next, does it just keep going through slides even if it starts over?
[21:14:42] <JoeHazzers> hrm
[21:14:46] <greg5green> then id stack them outside the viewport and control them separatly
[21:14:49] <greg5green> or
[21:15:04] <JoeHazzers> when i get to the end, i'd want it to go back to the beginning.
[21:15:18] <greg5green> if you keep hitting next, you just stop being able to hit next when you get to the end (and remove the button)
[21:15:47] <greg5green> or when you get to the end and hit next, itll slide the opposite direction all the way to the begining?
[21:15:51] <greg5green> then id put them in a long line
[21:16:08] <JoeHazzers> yes, the latter.
[21:16:21] <greg5green> ok, good, thats the easy one :P
[21:16:33] <greg5green> id just stack them in a long line
[21:17:12] <JoeHazzers> :D
[21:18:20] <greg5green> i think thats a better ux as well
[21:18:32] <greg5green> because it makes sure that the user realizes they reached the end of the slideshow
[21:18:46] <greg5green> the infinite carousel type i described first doesnt give that meaning to the user
[21:18:58] <JoeHazzers> i think it gives some continuity to it, as though it could be a physical object. when you get to the last page of a book, the first page isn't there when you turn over.
[21:18:59] <greg5green> "is this a really long slide show? or did I start over? or what?"
[21:19:35] <greg5green> ive had clients who disagree with me and insist on that infinite loop, boo
[21:19:50] <grafi> as long as they pay :P
[21:19:57] <greg5green> somewhat true
[21:20:04] <greg5green> but still frustrating, since they do hire me for my expertise :P
[21:20:23] <grafi> you mean in an ideal world they would
[21:20:27] <JoeHazzers> now, since i'm not going to know what images i have in advance, should i be putting these images *into* the slider, or setting them as backgrounds to divs (i want to put content in these slides)
[21:28:12] <greg5green> id probably put them as images
[21:28:17] <greg5green> into the slider
[21:30:53] <greg5green> meaning, the img tag is the content for the slider div, not directly into the slider container
[21:31:55] <JoeHazzers> yeah, i got that figured out
[22:15:11] <hateIE> hmmz @ the drop effect
[22:20:35] <hateIE> well thats actually a nice combination not to cpu hammery!.. i am using explode for closing my drop down menus 24 peices and "drop" to show my dialogs and "transfer" to close them
[22:21:50] <Carlitos__> hi all
[22:21:59] <Carlitos__> somebody awake ?
[22:22:01] <Carlitos__> :)
[22:22:52] <Carlitos__> why the  slider with jquery does not work ?
[22:22:55] <Carlitos__> http://sistemaciesac.com/
[22:22:57] <Carlitos__> ?
[22:24:15] <hateIE> looks like jquery is not even included properly
[22:25:36] <Carlitos__> hateIE: but, I am looking and lokks ok=? really ?
[22:27:27] <Carlitos__> the  css works ok, but only  the jquery ?
[22:27:43] <hateIE> hn.
[22:30:14] <hateIE> where is the _TMS function meant to be ?
[22:30:16] <Carlitos__> hateIE: you was  rigth
[22:30:56] <Carlitos__> maybe my script is not  reading properly  the js
[22:32:27] * hateIE turns the kettle on with a hammer
[22:34:00] <hateIE> $("#kettle").show("hammer",{type:claw,times:14},2000);
[22:34:59] <hateIE> fear my hammering speed 14 times in 2secs lol
[22:35:58] <hateIE> the matrix's cpu will be on fire
[22:39:30] <hateIE> Carlitos__ might want to upgrade your jquery to 1.8
[22:49:39] <Carlitos__> hateIE:  yeah will be  nice
[23:11:30] <JoeHazzers> fixImagesBecauseSomeoneDecidedThatCSSShouldBeAbleToCenterBackgroundImagesProperlyButNormalImages(); is a good and clear function name, right?
[23:14:25] <hateIE> never did get that one my self Joe
[23:15:04] <JoeHazzers> i have a very specific issue due to being a perfectionist
[23:16:14] <hateIE> sometimes you have to live with the ugly way till the elegant solution inevitbly turns up
[23:32:55] <djQuery> JoeHazzers, no its not as a rule anytime using camelCase when 2 uppercase letters are going to be next to each other you need to insert an _
[23:33:08] <JoeHazzers> djQuery: crap!
[23:33:17] <djQuery> fixImagesBecauseSomeoneDecidedThatCSS_ShouldBeAbleToCenterBackgroundImagesProperlyButNormalImages()
[23:33:23] <djQuery> there fixed it
[23:33:25] <JoeHazzers> :D
[23:33:52] <JoeHazzers> on a related note, can i fade in background images when they finish loading in the same way that i can with regular images?
[23:33:56] <djQuery> hope your ide supports autocomplete thought
[23:34:33] <djQuery> JoeHazzers, there are a lotta issues figuring out when they are done loading I believe
[23:34:41] <JoeHazzers> okay
[23:35:22] <djQuery> seen it done, it I just wasn't paying attention as it didn't seem worth it for all the trouble they were going through
[23:35:43] <JoeHazzers> sounds reasonable
[23:36:55] <JoeHazzers> also, how should i go about figuring out at any given time whether the cursor is inside the page?
