[05:19:15] <mrkie> hey
[05:19:35] <mrkie> i'm looking for a draggable side menu, like this: http://jakiestfu.github.io/Snap.js/demo/apps/rightDisabled.html does anyone know something?
[10:52:21] <Captain_Haddock> TypeError: $(...).button is not a function <--- Getting this when testing https://jqueryui.com/button/#checkbox in Drupal even though I can see that jquery.ui.core.js and jquery.ui.widget.js are loaded.
[10:52:28] <Captain_Haddock> What else could the problem be?
[10:56:39] <zagaza-> hi guys, I got the image in this fiddle split up in 2 parts, left and right. when you hover the mouse on the left part of the image, a left arrow is supposed to show, and when you hover it on the right part of the image, a right arrow is supposed to show. Now i'm not too skilled with javascript yet, and I believe my values are completely off. If you hover the image you can see the arrows but
[10:56:39] <zagaza-> they are not following the mouse http://jsfiddle.net/danneniko/qrypecnt/
[10:56:47] <zagaza-> can someone help me put the arrow where the mouse is?
[10:57:39] <rindolf> Hi all. Que pasa?
[10:57:46] <rindolf> I don't speak Spanish.
[11:04:19] <lemonsparrow> is there anyway to implement a back button for a page that take's care of history as well ?
[11:12:19] <rindolf> lemonsparrow: I believe there should be.
[11:13:07] <lemonsparrow> rindolf, not sure how though.. I was trying to read through this .. http://www.webdeveasy.com/back-button-behavior-on-a-page-with-an-iframe/
[11:13:48] <lemonsparrow> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API
[12:42:51] <quarters> hello.  I was wondering how to submit query constraints as described here: https://parse.com/docs/rest/guide#queries-query-constraints using jquery.  The API doc doesn't seem to jQuery friendly
[12:48:03] <shoky> quarters: you should probably use $.ajax for this, cause you need to set headers on the request
[12:51:18] <shoky> quarters: guess it'd be something like $.ajax({url: 'https://api.parse.com/1/classes/GameScore', headers: {'X-Parse-Application-Id': 'xyz', 'X-Parse-REST-API-Key': 'abcd'}, data: {where: JSON.stringify(yourQueryObj)}})
[14:40:56] <quarters> shoky: I tried out the solution using jquery and it kind of worked when I used {where:{username:"foo"}}, but didn't when using {where: {order:username}} and variations thereof(eg using JSON.stringify, quotes around the keys and values, etc)
[14:43:49] <quarters> nm, found out what was wrong
[14:52:51] <shoky> quarters: btw, parse has a javascript API you can use instead of making all these ajax requests on your own
[14:54:59] <quarters> wait, what?  that's awesome.  where can I find this?  I've googled "javascript Parse" "jquery Parse API" to no avail.  I wish Parse didn't name themselves as such....makes them practically ungooglable
[14:55:40] <shoky> quarters: uh check parse docs.. https://parse.com/docs/js/guide
[14:56:14] <quarters> whoa.  Thank you!
[14:56:33] <shoky> ;]
[14:59:30] <quarters> Is it best practice to have event handlers call functions instead of implementing the function within the handler?
[14:59:55] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[15:00:34] <shoky> separating stuff into small functions is always good practice ;p
[15:00:59] <quarters> like, would it be better for me to code something like $('#foo').on('click',fn) rather than $('#foo').on('click',function(){console.log})
[15:01:21] <quarters> especially if the callback is so short
[15:01:40] <Uhkis> do you reuse it is the question
[15:01:48] <quarters> Uhkis: no
[15:01:55] <shoky> either is fine.  the former is more readable, but yeah if the callback is short it's fine to have it inline
[15:01:55] <quarters> not in this situation
[15:02:28] <quarters> er..console.log*()
[15:02:33] <quarters> but you get the point
[15:03:00] <quarters> thanks
[15:03:00] <shoky> the former is much better especially if your callback has nested callbacks inside it, you can avoid a "pyramid" of callbacks by giving functions names
[15:04:11] <quarters> I'm still a bit confused with regards to how callbacks pass data without using arguments. I'm at this point blindly but hesitatingly accepting it as what just happens
[15:04:35] <quarters> or how parent functions pass data to callbacks rather
[15:04:38] <shoky> callbacks don't pass data.  whoever calls the callback passes the data
[15:04:53] <shoky> e.g. with .on()   it's  jquery's internal code calling the callback
[15:05:00] <shoky> and it passes arguments just by passing them ;p
[15:06:45] <shoky> for example you could implement your own function that accepts a callback, and you call that callback sometime later, passing whatever you want:  function f(callback) { setTimeout(function() { callback(1,2,3); }, 3000) }
[15:06:52] <quarters> is it typical for there to be only ONE piece of data to be passed (eg one object, one number, one string, etc)?
[15:07:11] <shoky> and you'd use that function like   f(function(a,b,c) {  console.log(a,b,c) })
[15:07:21] <shoky> that should log 1,2,3  after 3 seconds
[15:07:46] <shoky> mm no many callbacks have several arguments
[15:08:38] <nithin1992> Hi, sorry to interrupt
[15:08:51] <nithin1992> I'm kinda unclear as well
[15:08:53] <quarters> shoky: is the ideal way to find out the number of arguments that are passable to callbacks looking at the jQuery implementation or jQuery docs?
[15:09:02] <shoky> quarters: yes
[15:09:14] <rcyr> shoky++
[15:10:20] <nithin1992> So, when your passing the function and later assigning the values using  callback(1,2,3) these values of 1,2,3 are now the values of a,b,c right??
[15:10:46] <shoky> inside the callback, the arguments a,b,c will receive the values 1,2,3   yes
[15:11:38] <quarters> thanks, shoky.  I feel much more comfortable about them now
[15:11:56] <nithin1992> Yup, and this callback will be called post 3 seconds, and in those 3 seconds other lines of code get to execute right?
[15:27:19] <anunnaki_> hi, it's funny asking in tech channel though if anyone knows, is there any channels in freenode where i can discuss relationships issues?
[15:28:45] <robhol> irc might not be the best medium :p
[15:29:16] <anunnaki_> lol any other mediums? it's universal problem :p
[15:29:29] <quarters> does using $(document).ready(function(){}) and declaring and assigning all variables within that eliminate the need to declare a single global variable (eg. var Myapp = {}) or is it ill-advised to even declare everything under $(document).ready(function())?
[15:30:33] <quarters> I'm also speaking in rules-of-thumb terms w/out thinking about edge cases
[16:04:21] <shoky> quarters: document.ready doesnt really have anything to do with declaring a single global variable like your Myapp.. but in any case, it's best to avoid globals
[16:06:54] <quarters> shoky: what I took away from the advice to avoid globals is that you want don't want to unintentionally give the end user access to variables for [re]assignment.  I just saw that declaring variables within the callback for document.ready() as serving this purpose as well
[16:07:36] <quarters> I guess I'm trying to figure out the lesson to be drawn from avoiding globals outside of "avoid globals"
[16:08:12] <quarters> which I'm definitely going to heed...but I figured to be a better programmer, I should know some of the reasoning behind it
[16:09:17] <robhol> quarters: read about data encapsulation
[16:09:44] <jquery973> Hey guys, I'm having an issue with my transport app built with jQuery. I have no idea why the second click event isn't being triggered the "getTimes" function. http://jsfiddle.net/790eLwjs/
[16:09:53] <robhol> or actually, that's a different issue. basically you want to avoid globals because it makes it hard to keep track of what belongs to what.
[16:10:16] <lemonsparrow> is there a way to implement a back button that preserves the history and state of previous page ?
[16:10:55] <quarters> robhol: I thought that data-encapsulation was what was addressed with my remark about giving the end user access to variables to muck around with
[16:11:04] <robhol> Yes.
[16:11:18] <quarters> and data-encapsulation does cover what you said about organization of variables
[16:11:21] <quarters> right?
[16:11:24] <robhol> not quite
[16:12:05] <robhol> things like exposing public setters is one thing - that's an "access" issue. Having things like singletons and global instances is more of a "modeling" issue
[16:12:28] <robhol> anyway, I'm sure you could probably find more helpful stuff than my barely-coherent rambling :P
[16:12:51] <quarters> barely-coherent rambling to you; yummy info to me
[16:13:47] <quarters> your distinction totally makes sense
[16:14:21] <robhol> http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad   have a look at this. I've only skimmed the headings myself because i found it on google, but it seems to cover it
[16:14:58] <quarters> will do.  Thank you
[16:21:48] <quarters> jquery973: I'm having trouble running it using the 1st button as well.  Is jquery the only library you're using?
[16:25:17] <quarters> jquery973: the selector that triggers getTimes is ".bus__stop" but I can't find an html element with that class name
[16:31:38] <bgmCoder> Hi, all; I'm trying to use jquery to intercept the "New Item" button in Sharepoint 2010's ribbon.
[16:32:06] <bgmCoder> I can't get a handle on the element, though.  Here are some details: http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/162998/add-query-parameter-to-add-create-edit-links
[16:53:45] <jquery973> There is an html element called bus__stop but it's only generated after the first function is called
[16:54:08] <jquery973> so even if I run the first function (and the bus__stop elements are there) it doesn't wor
[16:54:52] <arc_> jquery973 if you are trying to bind an event to an html element that did not exist at the time the page ran, you need to use delegated event handling
[16:55:05] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:55:44] <arc_> this will show you how to do it. essentially you bind the event to a parent element that does exist when the page runs, which then listens for any elements matching your selector
[16:56:04] <jquery973> Ah, cool. Thanks. I'll have a look.
[17:54:55] <kaotikus_> hi all, is it still ok to use jQuery.noConflict()? i am exp issues with it right now
[17:54:58] <kaotikus_> away
[18:00:59] <profsimm> did jQuery drop the $ alias by efault in some version?
[18:04:54] <kaotikus_> profism: ^ is this a question that I should ask?
[18:05:52] <profsimm> kaotikus_: wut?
[18:06:00] <profsimm> kaotikus_: this is a question I'm asking :P
[18:15:52] <kaotikus_> profismm: sorry bout that. seemed similar to noConflict() question.

[19:17:05] <HowardwLo> why can’t I do something like: $('#error_list li').text().toArray() ?
[19:20:14] <arc_> probably because toarray requires a jquery object, and text() returns a string
[19:21:01] <HowardwLo> is it possible to convert the inner text of <li> into jquery object?
[19:21:41] <HowardwLo> O, contents() :D
[19:21:46] <HowardwLo> thanks
[19:22:14] <arc_> i'm .. not sure that's going to do what you want, but have at it i guess
[19:26:00] <HowardwLo> hm, getting an issue when using that array in Ajax
[19:26:11] <HowardwLo> i think its cause it’s a jQuery object and not the value within the list? :D
[19:30:54] <HowardwLo> issue is, Uncaught TypeError: Illegal Invocation
[19:31:34] <HowardwLo> how do i make it grab the inner text of every <li> and send that array to my backend?
[19:31:58] <Jfault> hey people, I've never used jquery before... I decided to use it for smoothScroll(), but it's not working
[19:37:25] <Jfault> I've loaded the smoothScroll() in my HTML... and .click() is working correctly, what's up?
