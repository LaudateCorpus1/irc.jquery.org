[00:03:41] <amirite> whats the diffrence between .prop() for checkbox elements
[00:10:57] <amitprakash> Hi, I have a local file which is constantly being populated with some value[only one value in file], is it possible for my website to read some input from this file[given that I allow any permissions required by browser]. If not.. can I connect to a local server socket or initiate a client local socket to which a local server might write this value?
[00:12:28] <sheilablackrose> im have a class of checkboxes n i want the ones that are checked. im using var  $checkedItems = $(".wealthMainCheckBox input[type='checkbox']:checked"); but not receiving anything
[00:12:34] <sheilablackrose> any idea

[00:40:21] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ sheilablackrose

[00:41:53] <molavy> is there a get_or_create element in jquery
[00:41:55] <molavy> ?
[00:41:57] <molavy> hi
[00:42:32] <molavy> any idea?
[00:43:06] <molavy> there is no idea?
[00:43:45] <sheilablackrose> its using dynamic tables n checkbox so its extremely hard to reproduce
[00:44:01] <sheilablackrose> was wondering if there is anything wrong with my syntax
[00:46:42] <ryanneufeld> yes there is
[00:46:59] <sheilablackrose> which part
[00:47:09] <molavy> how can i implement get or create jquery method
[00:47:09] <ryanneufeld> sheilablackrose: $checkedItems = $(".wealthMainCheckBox").find(':checked')
[00:47:12] <molavy> ?
[00:47:56] <sheilablackrose>  oh ok i thought th eother way could work as well. i had a code previously that used that syntax
[00:48:01] <sheilablackrose> thanks for the new one
[00:48:07] <sheilablackrose> could you tell me why that was worng?
[00:48:42] <ryanneufeld> well, specifying input[type=checkbox] and :checked is redundant
[00:49:23] <molavy> there is no idea?
[00:49:26] <sheilablackrose> ic i though one gives all the checkbox n the other gives only the ones that is checked
[00:49:30] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[00:49:43] <ryanneufeld> since :checked will only match checkboxes and radios
[00:49:54] <sheilablackrose> ic
[00:50:03] <ryanneufeld> molavy: you're not getting any responses because your question made no sense
[00:51:37] <molavy> i want add element to objects if there is no same element there
[00:51:39] <molavy> ?
[00:52:58] <molavy> like this : ("#form1").get_or_create({element:"input",type="text",id:"1"})
[00:53:16] <molavy> that means sense?
[00:53:30] <molavy> that made sense?
[00:53:39] <ryanneufeld> molavy: $('#someid').length === 1
[00:54:10] <ryanneufeld> molavy: if you select something that does not exist, length will be 0
[00:54:17] <ryanneufeld> you can use that to test for it.
[00:54:38] <ryanneufeld> what you're looking for is how to make a jquery plugin, which you can google for
[00:54:41] <ryanneufeld> I'm going to bed now
[00:54:45] <ryanneufeld> g'night
[00:54:50] <sheilablackrose> night
[00:54:53] <sheilablackrose> merry xmas
[00:55:03] <ryanneufeld> thanks, to you as well

[01:07:49] <Fid> heelo! I need autocomplete plugin
[01:08:09] <Fid> jquery's plugin is bullshit
[01:08:16] <Fid> don't work
[01:08:57] <meilu> why doesn't it work
[01:10:45] <Fid> I don't know how put value={$id} into input
[01:11:46] <Fid> other autocomplete http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ don't send ajax query to server
[01:12:11] <Fid> may be you know worked solutions?
[01:12:15] <Fid> or examples
[01:16:10] <meilu> what do you mean with "doesn't send ajax query to server" . the remote JSONP datasource example from your link has ajax functionality
[01:31:42] <jeremy-> Ive noticed a jquery error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #[object Object]  Since i probably made a mistake somewhere implementing jstree
[01:31:46] <jeremy-> How can i debug this better?
[01:33:59] <jeremy-> Hmm, might be since conflict with jstree cookies, since after 20 hack debugs i noticed removing this jstree plugin stops the console error
[01:47:41] <Ortund> okay so dudes in #javascript said I'm doing my success: wrong -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14018527/data-sent-via-ajax-doesnt-get-written-to-database
[01:48:04] <Ortund> they recommended I use functions, ie success: function() { stuff(); }
[01:54:56] <Ortund> so if I do success: function() { $('.result').css('display', 'block'); } would that work?
[01:58:30] <sahbeewah> why don't you try it and find out?
[02:19:58] <FesterCluck> Anyone up for talking conceptuals?
[02:20:39] <FesterCluck> I need to either determine the name of or work through the details of a privacy-minded API
[02:20:45] <Ortund> sahbeewah turns out it didn't work though console logs no errors
[02:22:59] <FesterCluck> The idea being that user Alice is using website Charl.ie, and their interaction involves a 3rd party api Bob
[02:23:53] <FesterCluck> Alice's information is submitted to Bob for processing, the result of which is returned to Charl.ie
[02:25:20] <FesterCluck> In this situation, one wants Bob to A) send a response to someone other than the requestor and B) Strip off all private/personal information from Alice's request, so Charl.ie only gets the result data, which is aggregate
[02:27:10] <FesterCluck> Is there a mathematical/programmatic means by which Bob can prove that his service will perform as advertised? (IE: No logging of data, no retransmission of request data to Charl.ie)
[02:57:18] <wathek> Hi everybody

[03:06:51] <BrixSat> Hello i have a timestamp lie this "2012-12-24 10:58:16.4241" and i dont know what are the last 4 digits, otherwise i could parse it with yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss :/ any help on what could thoose be?
[03:06:54] <_jastor> grrr

[03:07:47] <BrixSat> _jastor:  yes that may be but how do i parse it?
[04:04:35] <[ric]> If I am using $.getJSON do I need to send the data back with a content type of application/json or will text/html be OK?
[04:05:27] <[ric]> I have a file in a string JSON format that I can access via the browser directly but within my code it throws an error
[04:05:51] <[ric]> the code is here, and it's very small... http://jsfiddle.net/e546c/
[04:06:36] <[ric]> ah, actually I think I know the problem, I am testing this locally, and the file is on a domain, so it's probably a cross domain security issue
[04:06:58] <[ric]> the jsfiddle also suffer the issue due to different domains
[04:08:58] <[ric]> nope, even if I put the file locally it still throws an error
[04:09:03] <[ric]> is this to do with the content type sent?
[04:09:42] <trinadh> [ric]: what does the log say..
[04:09:43] <[ric]> should I just switch to a standard xmlhttp pickup and wait until I can control the content type sent to switch back to .getJSON
[04:09:54] <[ric]> which log trinadh
[04:10:26] <trinadh> [ric]: i meant the console in ff or chrome
[04:10:41] <[ric]> the consolde shows no errors
[04:12:04] <[ric]> from the server it returns a happy 200 OK status (I've downloaded it via the browser already so it's probably just using that cached version
[04:13:23] <[ric]> from the local version there is no record of it actually being served
[04:13:34] <trinadh> [ric]: json is considered as script so it will download but wont execute untill on same domain
[04:13:35] <[ric]> is there a way to display what error is being thrown
[04:13:53] <[ric]> trinadh that doesn't explain the issue locally though
[04:14:18] <trinadh> right.. locally, you are running it from a server right..
[04:14:27] <[ric]> no, from direct file access
[04:14:47] <[ric]> although in a subdir relative to the actual .html
[04:15:01] <[ric]> .. /data/datafile.json (example)
[04:15:17] <trinadh> [ric]: try using a local server..
[04:15:18] <[ric]> no I appreciate the problem with the cross domain
[04:16:22] <[ric]> or... I could just use my own xmlhttp script, the native JSON ES5 implementation and drop jquery altogether
[04:16:33] <[ric]> which is probably what I will do as I know that will work locally
[04:16:35] <[ric]> thanks anyway
[04:35:28] <anew> hey i'm trying to debut a popup, but cant figure out where to break the code

[05:51:03] <tellmann> hi, i want to control a longer php process with ajax calls from my html gui. i am using this function for starting the call http://privatepaste.com/6ebf4eb6f3 . but everytime i start this it laggs out my browser.
[06:19:25] <fabioportieri> hi, how to apply colorbox to links dinamically generated? it seems it's not triggered

[06:24:11] <fabioportieri> ok trying this..
[06:37:45] <fabioportieri> why href: function() { is skipped? inside colorbox
[06:37:56] <fabioportieri> i can't debug that function
[06:52:06] <luaa> hii, I have a question, I have a script that works when I have two times empty functions: $(function() { can someone tell me why?
[07:06:13] <admax81> could you see this code? http://pastebin.com/zr726axM :) what wrong with them? :)

[07:17:12] <batanze> Is there any reason why a jQuery POST would not work while the same CURL POST would work?
[07:18:11] <trinadh> cross domain issue may be..
[07:18:25] <batanze> no error there.
[07:18:34] <batanze> just says "pending"
[07:18:39] <FesterCluck> admax81: you have nothing with a class of confirm
[07:19:00] <FesterCluck> ".confirm"?
[07:19:10] <FesterCluck> shouldn't it be "#confirm"
[07:19:46] <FesterCluck> batanze: Ajax requests have an concurrency limit
[07:19:47] <cambazz> hello, i got an interesting question. if firefox is browser, and if i redirect from a servlet to some other page, and if user clicks back button, doc ready will not run
[07:19:49] <FesterCluck> maybe that?
[07:20:06] <batanze> Problem seems to stem from an internal redirect inside nginx.
[07:20:15] <batanze> BUT...no problems when I use curl.
[07:20:26] <cambazz> here is the catch, this does not happen in chrome or IE, and it wont happen if a href is followed. it happens because i send a redir froma servlet
[07:20:46] <batanze> FesterCluck: let me check that.
[07:20:50] <admax81> FesterCluck: tag <a> with class confirm.
[07:21:03] <FesterCluck> cambazz: That's a known issue with redirects from POSTS in Firefox
[07:21:17] <FesterCluck> There's even a new error code for it
[07:21:48] <batanze> Hmmm...doesn't seem to be that.
[07:22:43] <cambazz> FesterCluck: I added jquery adress
[07:22:49] <cambazz> and it solved the problem.
[07:24:12] <FesterCluck> lol
[07:26:18] <molavy> when django 1.5 final will release?

[07:38:49] <sheilablackrose> hi anyone alive?
[07:39:24] <batanze> The AJAX POST request seems to hang at: send jquery.min.js:2

[09:00:13] <Caelum> what's a nice way to write a function to be compatible with noConflict mode? this is what I'm doing now: https://gist.github.com/4369982
[09:00:48] <ryanneufeld> Caelum: what's with the \ everywhere?
[09:01:00] <Caelum> ryanneufeld: stupid template system :(
[09:01:13] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:01:21] <ryanneufeld> must be using eval in php then
[09:02:22] <fabsys> hello all
[09:02:24] <Caelum> INTERPOLATE in perl's Template Toolkit, but similar. When I have a couple hours free I'm going to rip it out with extreme prejudice
[09:03:25] <Caelum> ryanneufeld: but is this the nicest way of doing this? or should I put the named function inside the function ($) or something
[09:04:33] <fabsys> I have an problem with the return value of an function
[09:04:35] <fabsys> http://pastebin.com/seKNkHme
[09:05:10] <fabsys> I try to get the return value like this: var username_ok=username_check();
[09:06:10] <fabsys> but all when I debug the funtion the "var username_ok" are not defined
[09:06:34] <fabsys> someone can help me ?
[09:06:51] <ryanneufeld> Caelum: write your plugin as though you didn't need noConflict
[09:07:26] <ryanneufeld> then when you use it, you pass in the jquery reference returned by jQuery.noConflict()
[09:07:50] <wroathe_> Caelum: If this hasn't been said the best way I've found to reduce conflict problems is to wrap everything in a self invoking anonymous function and pass in jQuery
[09:07:58] <wroathe_> ryanneufeld: Or was that what you were saying?
[09:08:17] <ryanneufeld> wroathe_: you were more detailed, but yes
[09:09:10] <wroathe_> (function (window, $, undefined) { // enjoy $ in here }(window, jQuery));
[09:10:03] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryboilerplate.com/
[09:13:05] <Caelum> wroathe_: that's what I did, but I was asking if I was doing it the best way or maybe it's better with the functions swapped: https://gist.github.com/4369982
[09:14:30] <wroathe_> Caelum: That's not really what you did
[09:14:51] <wroathe_> Caelum: The idea is that you use that as a container to prevent naming collisions and you define and run  your logic inside of it
[09:15:14] <fabsys> how get returned value of an function ?
[09:15:14] <wroathe_> Check out ryanneufeld's link.
[09:15:23] <fabsys> I try this:
[09:15:30] <fabsys> http://pastebin.com/seKNkHme
[09:15:35] <fabsys> but it's not work
[09:16:20] <Caelum> wroathe_: huh? so what did I do
[09:16:59] <Caelum> I'm not writing a plugin
[09:17:24] <Caelum> I'm just trying to ensure that if someone does something like load prototype into the page my code will still work
[09:19:22] <Caelum> I suppose I should just put all my jquery-using functions into a function($) {} block
[09:19:30] <wroathe_> Caelum: I'll show you an example. One second.
[09:20:38] <wroathe_> Caelum: http://jsfiddle.net/R5QbL/4/
[09:21:23] <wroathe_> Caelum: Notice how the function is anonymous. It doesn't have to be that way but the whole point is to use the function as a container of sorts.
[09:21:52] <Caelum> ok thanks
[09:22:23] <wroathe_> The reason it's safe is because you're passing in the names of the objects you wish to alias.
[09:22:42] <wroathe_> If you did this: (function (window, $, undefined) {}(window, $, undefined)); it would defeat the purpose.
[09:23:14] <wroathe_> Because as soon as someone overwrote $ in the global scope the reference you passed in wouldn't exist.
[09:23:28] <wroathe_> But you're not in any danger of having jQuery overwritten
[09:23:33] <wroathe_> So you pass that in and alias it as $
[09:23:48] <wroathe_> Within that function's scope.
[09:35:16] <Caelum> wroathe_: yup changed my code to do that, thanks for your help
[09:41:44] <RonWhoCares> I am attempting to setup a screen for people to submit their selections following an e-bay auction.  https://www.theverseoftheday.info/ebay-wallet-card-selection/   The problem I am having is with the quantity the user is requesting variable.  I need to be able to make it unique  so I  can differentiate between the quantities for the products selected.  But the product list is created on the...
[09:41:45] <RonWhoCares> ...fly.  Is there way to do this?
[09:42:28] <RonWhoCares> Right now I am using:   echo "<input type=\"text\" class=\"ebay_wallet_card_selection_product_quantity\"><br />\r\n";
[09:42:59] <RonWhoCares> and the JQuery var product_quantity = $(".ebay_wallet_card_selection_product_quantity").val(); to retrieve it
[09:45:04] <RonWhoCares> what I need is something like class="ebay_wallet_card_selection_product_quantity.1" ... or some other way to insert the unique reference # for the product in the variable.  But I am unsure of how to retrieve this using Jquery without creating a bunch of variables to cover all the possibilities that it could be ...
[09:45:14] <RonWhoCares> Does my explanation make sense?
[09:45:59] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: use an id, not a class
[09:46:12] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: id = specific element, class = class of elements
[09:46:34] <RonWhoCares> ok --- but how will I find out that value with the JQuery script?
[09:46:47] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: $('#id_name')
[09:47:31] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: But the list of products is created on the fly
[09:47:37] <wroathe_> I remember one time working o a rather large application I was horrified to find out that the ruby programmers I was working with didn't know the difference between ids and classes. They used them interchangeably.
[09:47:59] <wroathe_> One page might have several elements with the same id.
[09:48:07] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: so why can't you create your form on the fly with jquery?
[09:48:21] <wroathe_> I'm sure that must throw most browsers internal tree-parsing logic into a tailspin...
[09:48:24] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: I am not sure how to do so
[09:49:19] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: I just changed it back to an id ---   <input type="text" id="ebay_wallet_card_selection_product_quantity[54]">
[09:50:17] <Caelum> wroathe_: I've seen some of that kind of crap here too
[09:50:59] <RonWhoCares> I am wanting to retrieve the value of the quantity above the button that is clicked --- <button class="ebay_wallet_card_selection_update_selection" id="582a28abf5825a87deb175c18034309c.49">Update Selection</button>
[09:52:14] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: $('#button_id').prev().find('input:eq(0)') // will give you the input right above the button
[09:52:51] <RonWhoCares> The button that is clicked is easy to retrieve ---- var product_reference = $(this).attr('id');
[09:53:49] <RonWhoCares> Can I replace     $(this).attr('id')    with     $('#button_id')   from the code you wrote?
[09:53:50] <Caelum> no wait that's wrong
[09:55:05] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: ok
[09:55:06] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: .prevAll() instead of .prev()
[09:55:23] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: just replace $('#button_id') with $(this)
[09:56:52] <RonWhoCares> So I should use this:  $(this).prevAll().find('input:eq(0)')
[09:57:05] <Caelum> that should work yeah
[09:57:57] <Caelum> that will give you the input, then you can call .val() on it to get the value
[09:59:48] <RonWhoCares> I don't understand where I should put the    .val()
[10:00:03] <Johnnn> Hello. Im trying to solve this problem : http://pastebin.com/gy6QYU3W .. i need to check reCaptcha with jquery (done) and if its right, send my form to register.php where i will save informations to database.
[10:00:44] <Johnnn> I tried redirecting to register.php after it sucess but it didnt parse values.
[10:01:02] <RonWhoCares> I just change    $(".ebay_wallet_card_selection_product_quantity").val()   to   var product_quantity = $(this).prevAll().find('input:eq(0)');    the script stopped working
[10:01:31] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: after the find
[10:01:52] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: when your script stops working, check error console or firebug or whatever
[10:02:42] <admax81> how to make confirm dialog on button or link?
[10:02:45] <RonWhoCares> Is this the correct use of     .val     ?   $(this).prevAll().find.val(('input:eq(0)'))
[10:02:59] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: god no
[10:03:13] <wroathe> admax81: prompt
[10:03:15] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: do you understand anything about jquery at all? have you gone through a tutorial or something?
[10:03:47] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: let me put together a fiddle for you, one moment
[10:03:53] <RonWhoCares> I have done several JQuery ... but this is the first time I used it for this context
[10:03:59] <RonWhoCares> ok, I very much appreciate this Caelum
[10:03:59] <wroathe> Caelum: We get a lot of people like that in here. The best bet is to provide them with some links and send them on their merry way.
[10:05:03] <Technodrome> i need to create a slider
[10:05:09] <Technodrome> i wonder if jquery is a good solution for this
[10:05:17] <ryanneufeld> Technodrome: jquery ui has one
[10:05:34] <ryanneufeld> Technodrome: http://jqueryui.com/slider/
[10:06:40] <Technodrome> this is a bit of a special slider
[10:08:11] <Technodrome> i was thinking about just using pure javascript
[10:08:34] <admax81> wroathe: thank you man! :)
[10:15:57] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: http://jsfiddle.net/UJEHn/
[10:16:15] <Caelum> RonWhoCares: actually you have to use .filter here not .find, that threw me off a bit
[10:18:01] <wroathe> Technodrome: Have fun... I guarantee this process will be painful for you.
[10:18:43] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: ok
[10:20:50] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: I am just setting this up right now
[10:22:06] <Johnnn> Hello. Im trying to solve this problem : http://pastebin.com/gy6QYU3W .. i need to check reCaptcha with jquery (done) and if its right, send my form to register.php where i will save informations to database.
[10:22:08] <Johnnn> I tried redirecting to register.php after it sucess but it didnt parse values.
[10:24:33] <RonWhoCares> Caelum: Thank you very much
[10:36:40] <Johnnn> can anybody help me with my problem ? :c im rly lost.
[10:37:16] <FesterCluck> Ask the question, don't bother asking to ask the question
[10:37:34] <FesterCluck> But  thank you for trying to be polite
[10:41:13] <Hapzzz> why won't $('input').first().focus(); work?
[10:41:17] <Hapzzz> i have an <input> on the page.
[10:43:23] <Johnnn> Hello. Im trying to solve this problem : http://pastebin.com/gy6QYU3W .. i need to check reCaptcha with jquery (done) and if its right, send my form to register.php where i will save informations to database.
[10:43:32] <Johnnn> I tried redirecting to register.php after it sucess but it didnt parse values.
[10:43:38] <Johnnn> thats my question.
[10:44:35] <FesterCluck> Johnnn: You probably need to do a 307 redirect instead of whatever you are doing now
[10:45:04] <FesterCluck> Hapzzz: That should work, are you getting an error in the console, or just nothing?
[10:46:18] <Hapzzz> FesterCluck nothing
[10:48:42] <FesterCluck> What do you get when you break before that line and run $('input').length ?
[10:53:38] <NickWebman> Hi. I am not so great with jQuery and was hoping someone could take a peek at this -> http://jsfiddle.net/HGbrg/2/. I'm trying to get the value from a div called .broker-email and set it as the default value for a form field with the id of #edit-submitted-broker-email--2. What am I doing wrong? Thanks.
[10:54:00] <FesterCluck> Hapzzz: Visually nothing may happen, except maybe scrolling to that input. Are you expecting to see a blinking cursor?
[10:55:50] <rindolf> NickWebman: let me see.
[10:55:57] <NickWebman> thanks
[10:56:23] <FesterCluck> Hapzzz: Try $('input').first().focus().select()
[10:56:34] <FesterCluck> You may get more of what you are looking for that way
[10:56:40] <rindolf> NickWebman: should the JS include the <script type ... opening and closing tags?
[10:57:07] <Hapzzz> k
[10:57:09] <rindolf> NickWebman:  jQuery('input#edit-submitted-broker-email--2').value = (s); ==> is this valid?
[10:57:19] <rindolf> shouldn't it be .value(s) ?
[10:57:26] <Caelum> it should be .val()
[10:57:31] <NickWebman> rindolf: i am not sure
[10:57:33] <rindolf> Caelum: ah, OK.
[10:57:55] <NickWebman> ok. so no equals sign?
[10:58:00] <rindolf> NickWebman: no.
[10:58:09] <rindolf> NickWebman: .val(s);
[10:58:31] <FesterCluck> to set val is .val("newvalue")
[10:59:02] <NickWebman> works perfectly. Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it.
[11:01:53] <versatiletech> has anyone ever pushed a force download to a browser by an ajax response? I'm wondering if it's possible.
[11:02:54] <FesterCluck> verysoftoiletppr: There's no getting around the save prompt, but yeah, it can be done
[11:03:12] <verysoftoiletppr> FesterCluck not for me I suppose
[11:03:21] <Johnnn> How can i make from this code : http://pastebin.com/EfJbjkbU script, that will automatically send me to register.php instead of creating another submit button.
[11:03:25] <verysoftoiletppr> maybe you need to dump one?
[11:03:59] <FesterCluck> verysoftoiletppr: Tell me more about this download, and I'll get you the best method
[11:05:33] <verysoftoiletppr> FesterCluck what are you talking about?
[11:05:42] <verysoftoiletppr> [19:01:53] <versatiletech> has anyone ever pushed a force download to a browser by an ajax response? I'm wondering if it's possible.
[11:05:50] <FesterCluck> sory
[11:05:55] <verysoftoiletppr> FesterCluck it's versatiletech not verysoftoiletppr
[11:05:58] <FesterCluck> versatiletech
[11:06:01] <versatiletech> lol
[11:06:10] <FesterCluck> Tab completion, first world problems
[11:06:18] <versatiletech> yes
[11:10:53] <rindolf> Johnnn: please don't /msg me.
[11:11:06] <Technodrome> wroathe:  what will be painful?
[11:12:16] <rindolf> Johnnn: please stop /msg ing me.
[11:12:30] <rindolf> Johnnn: unless you're willing to pay me for my time.
[11:12:41] <Johnnn> aha
[11:13:07] <Johnnn> How can i make from this code : http://pastebin.com/EfJbjkbU script, that will automatically send me to register.php instead of creating another submit button.
[11:13:37] <FesterCluck> Sure, find the spot where it creates the button, and add a window.location() call instead
[11:13:49] <Cronoh> $('form').submit();
[11:15:45] <Caelum> wroathe: one catch with the (function($) { ... hack is you have to make global functions like: function_name = function (params...) { ... }
[11:17:20] <Caelum> wroathe: that's still much nicer than what I was doing
[11:17:54] <FesterCluck> Am I ignoring this wroathe person?
[11:18:41] <Caelum> no I was just talking to him a few hours back
[11:21:42] <Johnnn> Cronoh when i add $('form').submit(); it creates another button so i have to press 2 buttons . One for validating captcha and then it creates another one for sending and that i dont want
[11:22:18] <Johnnn> I want to send that form to reg.php when captcha is succesfull
[11:24:09] <wroathe> Caelum: What?
[11:24:32] <FesterCluck> Johnnn: Then find the function the captcha is callling, wrap it with your functionality, and rename it
[11:24:42] <wroathe> Caelum: What do you mean? Are you saying that if you want to make a function global you have to omit the var keyword?
[11:28:46] <wroathe> Technodrome: Creating a slider with pure JS.
[11:29:52] <Technodrome> wroathe:  its more or less just sliding a div that holds all the content and sliding in a new one?
[11:31:47] <Caelum> wroathe: no if you just do function foo(...) {} it's local to the anon function
[11:39:06] <mikef> whats the best book on jquery? (printed on online)
[11:40:28] <omg|its|otr> When I run this code I get the error back from ajax "syntax error: unexpected token F"
[11:40:30] <omg|its|otr> http://pastie.org/5573651
[11:40:44] <omg|its|otr> But there isn't actually a letter F in my code on the server
[11:41:08] <omg|its|otr> Are there some error codes that I don't know about?
[11:41:38] <fission6> whats the proper way to make a json call to a service on another domain, i don't think it supports jsonp but i still get the json response when i do getJSON but an error is thrown, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[11:45:07] <fission6> anyone?
[11:45:09] <wroathe> Caelum: That's the whole point. If you wish to expose something to the global scope create a namespace of sorts to hold all of your code.
[11:45:15] <Caelum> omg|its|otr: you mean you get that error in your error callback?
[11:45:23] <wroathe> Caelum: Even if it's something as simple as window.helpers = {};
[11:45:36] <omg|its|otr> Yes Caelum.
[11:45:54] <wroathe> Caelum: Then, inside of the anonymous function do something like var helpers = window.helpers; helpers.myHelperMethod = function () {};
[11:46:08] <Caelum> omg|its|otr: that can only mean it's coming from the server
[11:46:19] <Caelum> omg|its|otr: try testing the api in the browser
[11:46:32] <wroathe> Caelum: Then if you need to work with that method from another source file you can grab the global object var helpers = window.helpers; helpers.myHelperMethod();
[11:46:39] <Caelum> wroathe: I see
[11:46:57] <wroathe> Caelum: jQuery itself uses this pattern.
[11:47:36] <OneBraveHog> I am thinking of using jQuery for some mobile application use.  I know jQueryMobile exists, but it seems jQuery functions just fine.   Can anyone see a reason to NOT use jQuery for mobile ?
[11:48:02] <OneBraveHog> so long as I keep CSS in check for mobile vs larger view ?
[11:48:16] <wroathe> Caelum: Inside of an anonymous function it bootstraps everything and then in the last few lines it does window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;
[11:48:22] <opie-x> anyone familar enough with sortable tell me what scenario the res[1] results makes sense on this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.sortable.js#L487  I use a key and custom expression and I end up getting "key=key&key=key" back because of the && ?
[11:48:23] <Caelum> fission6: no idea about cross-domain calls, as for the syntax error, did you check the error console?
[11:48:52] <wroathe> OneBraveHog: They're completely different things.
[11:49:22] <wroathe> OneBraveHog: In fact, jQuery mobile depends on jQuery
[11:50:11] <OneBraveHog> wroathe - oh.
[11:50:19] <OneBraveHog> wroathe - I figured they were two separate libraries
[11:50:30] <OneBraveHog> but I was just happy with jQuery
[11:50:55] <OneBraveHog> so I got to thinking, if I keep everything forked using CSS to show for cell or larger screen ? I couldn't see any reason not to use just jQuery
[11:51:02] <wroathe> OneBraveHog: That's why it's beneficial to read documentation :) http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/about/getting-started.html
[11:51:38] <OneBraveHog> funny, I have the 'Features' page open for that site as I have had for the last day
[11:51:42] <OneBraveHog> I didn't click Getting Started yet
[11:51:45] <OneBraveHog> thanks
[11:53:10] <OneBraveHog> oh, I see clearer now.
[11:53:17] <OneBraveHog> It's there if I want to use it on TOP of jQuery
[12:08:22] <fabsys> merry chrismas hahahahahah !
[12:14:00] <fission6> whats the proper way to make a json call to a service on another domain, i don't think it supports jsonp but i still get the json response when i do getJSON but an error is thrown, Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[12:25:59] <astropirate> fission6, then its not sending back proper json
[12:26:30] <astropirate> you can't make an ajax request to another domain
[12:26:56] <astropirate> if you control the remote site
[12:27:02] <astropirate> give it jsonp support
[12:27:12] <fission6> i dont
[12:27:23] <omg|its|otr> if I have a bunch of elements with ids "pidX" where X is some unique integer, how can I search the page to find the one with the greatest number?
[12:27:31] <astropirate> if you don't, well.. you will need some kind of servside code that will act as a request proxy
[12:27:33] <fission6> i can make the request using jsonp its just that the response doesn't wrap it correctly
[12:27:47] <fission6> but i still get the results, i just need to interpret it differen;t
[12:28:11] <fission6> I'm getting the results its just being interpreted as javascript
[12:28:12] <astropirate> fission6, does the server support jsonp?
[12:28:16] <fission6> i should be able to catch that
[12:28:26] <fission6> nope apparently not cause i tried to pass a callback
[12:29:17] <astropirate> fission6, you know how jsonp works?
[12:29:19] <astropirate> wondering
[12:29:22] <fission6> yes
[12:29:38] <astropirate> .. you sure? :)
[12:29:52] <astropirate> the response should be valid javascript, because its interpereted by the browser
[12:29:56] <astropirate> if it isn't an error is thrown
[12:30:37] <fission6> yes, i am forcing jquery to make a jsonp by adding callback=? to the getJSON, the server is responding and i am getting my correct response, but obviously its being interpreted at javascript, i just want to catch it and load it as json vs having it execute as javascript
[12:30:55] <fission6> astropirate: right, so i want to catch that error
[12:31:46] <astropirate> fission6, its executed in the  document scope, you can't catch it
[12:32:27] <fission6> well thats silly cause somewhere the response exists
[12:43:02] <MonsterKiller> hey,how can i test to see if element X id defined before or after element y?
[12:43:47] <MonsterKiller> i was trying prevUntil to see if it could find element Y before element X if not, then its after. but it doesnt seem to work too well :p
[12:45:29] <quijote> anyone have time to help a newbie with a weird error?
[12:46:27] <quijote> http://www.niztech.com/Client/fje/cambria/
[12:46:38] <quijote> I could use help with this
[12:55:39] <astropirate> fission6, imagine making an ajax request to someone's facebook profile page
[12:55:43] <astropirate> on your website
[12:55:45] <astropirate> if they are loged in
[12:55:50] <astropirate> you will have all of their information
[12:55:55] <astropirate> that would be pretty stupid wouldn't it?
[12:56:13] <astropirate> look up same origin policy
[12:57:25] <fission6> huh
[12:57:47] <fission6> ytea i understand all of it and my options, but its still silly, i would think there is a way to get to the HTMLScriptElements code
[12:58:04] <biberao> merry christmas
[12:58:08] <Caelum> fission6: do the request serverside
[12:58:48] <fission6> i am trying to avoid server side, it will make it harder to hand a solution over to the client
[13:00:20] <Caelum> you can't really write an app purely in js
[13:00:32] <fission6> yes i can
[13:00:38] <Caelum> give them a .php they can stick somewhere
[13:00:41] <Caelum> not a big deal
[13:00:53] <FesterCluck> Caelum: Sure you can
[13:00:55] <FesterCluck> Even when including server
[13:01:12] <Caelum> well yeah I meant not using node or something
[13:01:15] <FesterCluck> Browser + Node.JS + MongoDB
[13:01:15] <FesterCluck> done
[13:02:11] <FesterCluck> You can't avoid same origin policy purely client side
[13:02:26] <cuebix> whaddup my ninjas?
[13:02:40] <FesterCluck> If it's facebook, you should investigate their API more to find what you need
[13:02:40] <Caelum> REAL ULTIMATE POWER
[13:03:39] <FesterCluck> Phenomenal Cosmic Power!
[13:03:39] <FesterCluck> itty bitty living space
[13:03:43] <FesterCluck> That is Ajax, in a nutshell
[13:04:31] <fission6> i should be able to get the code in another script element no?
[13:05:07] <Caelum> I heard of some hack to cross iframe boundaries
[13:06:30] <cuebix> I love it when I come into a place like this to ask for help, and then as I type it out I figure out the solution lol
[13:06:43] <cuebix> I need a rubber duck to talk to
[13:06:47] <Caelum> yeah that happens to everyone
[13:07:05] <cuebix> :)
[13:07:12] <Caelum> I just hold discussions with myself, in public
[13:07:25] <Caelum> but I'm insane, so that may not work well for you
[13:10:28] <cuebix> lol
[13:10:32] <cuebix> I do the same, when I'm programming
[13:10:42] <cuebix> My co-workers think I'm crazy… sadly, they are correct
[13:12:12] <cuebix> Man, I love coffeescript.
[13:21:19] <Gandalfski> Can anybody help me with this problem ? :( please. http://pastebin.com/hbBe5rS8
[13:29:31] <Caelum> Gandalfski: http://malsup.com/jquery/form/
[13:29:53] <Caelum> Gandalfski: you want .ajaxSubmit
[13:31:29] <Gandalfski> Okay. Will look at it.
[13:36:02] <Gandalfski> *_* it doesnt work
[13:36:40] <ispirto> hello, when i run this http://pastebin.com/iWWHcxLw, it says orgdate is not defined. how can i make this work? it's for this: http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/
[13:38:17] <Caelum> Gandalfski: works fine for me
[13:38:29] <Caelum> Gandalfski: did you check your server log?
[13:40:01] <nerdsex> I load some input fields via ajax.  I want to prepulate those fields with variables already set, like a checkbox. $('#checkbox').attr('checked', ' checked ') won't  check the checkbox, though
[13:41:00] <nerdsex> basically, how do i check a checkbox if the checkbox was loaded via an ajax call
[13:41:34] <Caelum> isn't it .prop('checked', true)
[13:41:35] <Gandalfski> Should i load that jquery.form.js in my document with form or into that validating script.
[13:41:46] <Gandalfski> im so damn tired. No idea how to do it.
[13:42:02] <Caelum> Gandalfski: you load it in your <head> section
[13:42:02] <Gandalfski> Spended whole day on this damn thing.
[13:42:11] <Gandalfski> ye. i did
[13:42:36] <Caelum> Gandalfski: put your code up on gist or something
[13:43:21] <nerdsex> isnt prop('checked') the same as attr('checked', ' checked ')
[13:43:40] <Caelum> nerdsex: I had some problems changing the checked property on radiobuttons once, when it was called from an onclick='' handler, it didn't work, but when I did it with .click(function() it worked
[13:46:06] <sahbeewah> nerdsex: check that you have the correct selector
[13:46:27] <Caelum> also check that the checkbox exists when you're trying to check it
[13:47:31] <Gandalfski> https://gist.github.com/4370783  // my table in table structured form. (kinda sad) and my validating file : https://gist.github.com/4370785 that should post informations to register.php
[13:49:10] <sahbeewah> Gandalfski: You have logical errors
[13:49:24] <nerdsex> sahbeewah: i do. it works if i paste that line in firebug
[13:49:45] <nerdsex> Caelum: i want to check it without waiting for an event. there is no 'click'
[13:49:50] <Caelum> nerdsex: are you checking the checkbox in your ajax success handler?
[13:50:00] <nerdsex> Caelum: no
[13:50:02] <sahbeewah> nerdsex: that means the checkboxes don't exist on the page at the time on which you're calling that line
[13:50:16] <nerdsex> sahbeewah: exactly. my question is, how tof ix this
[13:50:29] <Caelum> nerdsex: either set async: false; or use a success handler
[13:50:31] <nerdsex> almost as if, "how do i use the .on() method with .attr()"
[13:51:10] <Caelum> Gandalfski: $('#form').submit() sets an onsubmit handler on a form, but you are already IN an onsubmit handler
[13:52:03] <sahbeewah> nerdsex: I don't know what you're trying to do. I thought you wanted to load some input fields when the ajax retrieves some data
[13:52:16] <sahbeewah> how is .on related?
[13:54:03] <nerdsex> it isn't. its the concept that on is used for elements appended to the dom later
[13:54:11] <nerdsex> but we use it to register events
[13:54:12] <Gandalfski> Yeah. Isnt that why i dont want to submit form anymore, but just send it to php file. Or.. how can i fix that. When recaptcha code is right ==>>>> SEND MY FORM VALUES TO reg.php
[13:54:31] <nerdsex> i want to do somethin to a checkbox that is appended to the dom via ajax.
[13:54:55] <Caelum> Gandalfski: all you have to do is return true from your onsubmit handler to submit the form, if you want to submit the form yourself then use ajaxSubmit
[13:55:10] <Caelum> nerdsex: then you have to do it in the ajax success handler
[13:55:19] <Caelum> nerdsex: otherwise it doesn't exist yet
[13:56:12] <Caelum> Gandalfski: if you return false from an onsubmit handler, form won't be submitted, if you return true, it will be submitted
[13:57:44] <Gandalfski> i so.. you want to tell me, that only thing that i have to do it place  return true; there and it will work. ok.. will try
[13:58:10] <Gandalfski> if its true, i hate this world and want my 9 hours of nothingdoing back.
[13:59:36] <nerdsex> even doing it in the ajax success call doesn't work, homies.
[14:02:54] <sahbeewah> Gandalfski: No, there's a lot of things wrong with your code
[14:03:44] <sahbeewah> for example, you can't read .responseText on a deferred object
[14:03:55] <sahbeewah> you need to resolve it first
[14:04:05] <Gandalfski> Somehow i dont know how is that possible. It worked well.. till now.
[14:04:34] <sahbeewah> you can use the success callback on the ajax or preferably chain .done onto the ajax call
[14:04:52] <sahbeewah> $.ajax({ ... }).done(function(responseText) { ... });
[14:06:15] <sahbeewah> $('#form').submit( function ) doesn't actually submit anything, it attaches a handler to when it is actually submitted
[14:07:05] <Gandalfski> well.. i will try to do it other way..   <form action="reg.php" onsubmit="return validateCaptcha();" method="post" name="reg" id="reg">
[14:07:40] <Gandalfski> and now i have to edit that validating code somehow.
[14:08:01] <Caelum> nerdsex: here is an example of checking a dynamically added checkbox: http://jsfiddle.net/DRBpe/
[14:08:06] <sahbeewah> no don't use the onsubmit attribute
[14:09:07] <Gandalfski> Ok. I wont.
[14:09:55] <Caelum> nerdsex: try doing something like: console.log($('#checkbox'))
[14:13:16] <Gandalfski> So. I placed your code instead .responseText... now .. should i leave that .done(function(responseText));  blank or put something in it ?
[14:13:43] <Caelum> sahbeewah: he has async: false, so it doesn't matter
[14:13:59] <Caelum> or at least it shouldn't matter
[14:15:20] <sahbeewah> Caelum: you'r right by bad
[14:16:21] <sahbeewah> Gandalfski: how did you attach the validateCaptcha method to the form?
[14:19:11] <sealeaf> Hi, I'm trying to get the value of a checkbox, but $row.find('.checkbox-class').val() is not working
[14:19:18] <sealeaf> Anyone know why?
[14:20:02] <Gandalfski> hm. like this ? form action="javascript:validateCaptcha()"
[14:23:39] <sahbeewah> Gandalfski: ok so get rid of that whole action="javascript..."
[14:23:53] <sahbeewah> use this http://jsfiddle.net/aGPSP/1/
[14:23:57] <sahbeewah> fill in the blanks
[14:26:38] <sahbeewah> sealeaf: use $(selector).is(':checked') which returns a bool
[14:26:47] <sealeaf> sahbeewah: thanks
[14:29:21] <fission6> is there a jquery plugin to make cross domain requests possible, perhaps through iframe
[14:35:33] <Gandalfski> So. Now im having this http://jsfiddle.net/BfnXn/
[14:36:44] <Gandalfski> But.. somehow i dont understand, what (res === 'success') do. Since in lasr code there was  var html = $.ajax and  if(html == "success")
[14:38:17] <Caelum> ispirto: do you still need help?
[14:38:26] <ispirto> Caelum, got it
[14:38:36] <Caelum> excellent
[14:44:22] <nerdsex> Caelum: thanks , man
[14:45:13] <Gandalfski> This is how validateform.php looks btw https://gist.github.com/4370909
[14:46:47] <fission6> anyone make cross domain requests with jquery before, not jsonp
[14:48:19] <cuebix> fission6: I've only done it by sending the request to my server and using it as a proxy
[14:54:46] <voot545> I have a .find() I'm using which freezes my page for up to 5~8 seconds; is there a different way to return all elements in a page in document order?
[14:56:01] <rmurphey> voot545: i hesitate to ask, why do you need all elements in the page?
[14:56:39] <voot545> my user might highlight any given contiguous group of elements
[14:57:19] <voot545> I really just need a large array/jQuery object of all elements in document/contiguous order
[14:57:20] <Caelum> voot545: so use a selected class or something?
[14:57:47] <voot545> .contents().filter() will go through things out of order
[14:58:18] <Caelum> really?
[14:58:39] <voot545> actually, yes I'm using .find('myclass') to get all the stuff I've preprocessed with .contents().filter()
[14:59:01] <voot545> I have to because .find() explicitly returns using document order; that's a documented change from 1.4 I think
[14:59:51] <voot545> so beyond any native jQuery functionality, it looks like I need to write something to go through the page that doesn't freeze it
[14:59:58] <voot545> (in document order)
[15:07:45] <bil`> voot545: do the elements being returned need to be jquery objects?
[15:08:12] <voot545> no
[15:08:29] <eltigre> hey, I am using jquery mobile. I am trying to switch between two programatically injected pages
[15:09:10] <eltigre> the problem I have now is that after switching back, the event handlers are not attached anymore
[15:09:12] <fission6> how can i get an object which represents a forms data
[15:09:24] <eltigre> though for example the canvas I am using is still the same
[15:09:59] <bil`> what about using getElementsByTagName('*')
[15:10:21] <voot545> dunno I'll look into that
[15:10:25] <voot545> thanks
[15:11:16] <bil`> its native so should be speedy
[15:37:53] <zg> I'm having an issue in Firefox with the .length param
[15:42:02] <zg> http://term.qt.io/ -- open javascript console, type a few letters as a test username, then hit backspace
[15:42:06] <rindolf> zg: hi.
[15:42:14] <zg> hell
[15:42:15] <zg> o
[15:43:20] <zg> http://pastie.org/private/5m8kzwq3nbz7aipsxtyaq
[15:43:40] <zg> that works fine the first time you hit backspace in firefox, but it doesn't work after the first time
[15:46:00] <zg> rindolf: could you take a look?
[15:49:14] <rindolf> zg: let me see.
[15:50:25] <rindolf> zg: seems like it keeps executing the same JS again and again.
[15:50:32] <rindolf> zg: can't it be event based?
[15:51:22] <zg> event based?
[15:51:37] <zg> rindolf: event based?
[15:52:35] <rindolf> zg: yes, instead of overloading the JS interepreter.
[15:52:45] <rindolf> zg: firebug keeps highlighting lines on and off.
[15:52:57] <zg> yeah
[15:52:59] <zg> theres a blinker
[15:53:05] <zg> it's a terminal emulator :P
[15:53:17] <rindolf> zg: ah.
[15:53:30] <rindolf> zg: did you write it yourself?
[15:54:05] <zg> rindolf: yes
[15:54:16] <zg> it has some bugs in firefox
[15:54:21] <rindolf> zg: ah.

[16:55:04] <Caelum> does errorThrown from the .ajax error handler stringify to a message?
[16:57:24] <Caelum> yes it does, cool
[17:15:24] <OneBraveHog> so quiet in here
[17:15:31] <OneBraveHog> everyone must have a life !
[17:15:53] <OneBraveHog> Or they at the JQuery X-mas party and ole Hoggers wasn't invited !
[17:30:12] <Caelum> argh, something in this shitty CSS is breaking dialog button text for jquery-ui
[17:39:29] <Caelum> I turned off all the CSS in inspect element and I still don't see the buttons
[17:39:43] <Caelum> and the same thing works on jsfiddle
[17:42:22] <Caelum> text-indent: -9999px; ?
[17:42:26] <Caelum> wtf?
[17:44:22] <Caelum> added a style to set it to 0 and now it works
[17:47:09] <wroathe> Caelum: ?
[17:47:13] <wroathe> Caelum: What are you talking about?
[17:48:17] <Caelum> wroathe: for some reason my ui-button-text style had a text-indent: -9999px
[17:48:42] <Caelum> wroathe: which was hiding the jquery ui dialog button text
[17:49:12] <Caelum> wroathe: I set it to 0 in my style section and now it works
[17:49:54] <wroathe> Caelum: Hmm. That's strange.
[17:52:59] <Caelum> wroathe: it doesn't happen when I put the same code in jsfiddle
[18:03:46] <Foxhoundz> Hello $!
[18:06:01] <OneBraveHog> Hello
[18:19:06] <fotoflo> hey all. quick question, I'm working with a combo box (select)… how do I accomplish this 1: $( "#ComboBox" ).change(function() { /* do something here */ }); with $.live()
[18:19:06] <fotoflo> ?
[18:21:18] <eltigre> fotoflo, $.live() is deprecated by the way
[18:21:30] <fotoflo> oh? why?
[18:21:38] <eltigre> read the docs
[18:22:31] <fotoflo> interesting
[18:22:31] <fotoflo> thanks
[19:02:57] <Caelum> anyone know of some plugin to add/subtract currency?

[19:25:34] <klama> I want to search for a plugin (wordpress) that does just that. adds a sliding submenu when u hover a button in the main one, sliding the content downward
[19:25:43] <klama> Problem is: i don't know how this type of menu is called
[19:25:47] <klama> "horizontal sliding menu" ?
[19:26:15] <scar> vimeo

[20:53:02] <codepython777> Anyone know what is the most appropriate place to ask this question: Anyone knows how to make w3c validator work for https sites that use self-signed certificates? It seems to give me this error: 500 SSL negotiation failed
[22:55:28] <TAFB> I made a dynamic update script but realized it's probably murdering the server with requests. I've looked through the docs but have no idea how to read the html file in one go, but have it only update the different <div> parts :( http://pastie.org/5575075
[22:58:14] <jastor> someoen that can please explain to me what CSS means?
[22:58:17] <jastor> someone*
[22:58:45] <jastor> the word CSS
[22:59:00] <TAFB> jastor: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets
[22:59:24] <jastor> ohwell lets get right to the point ... jquery mobile wont let me override the link colors even though i load the new .css file AFTER the jquery mobile css
[22:59:32] <jastor> its the whole "cascading" part thats falling apart
[23:01:18] <jastor> i want different colors for links in <footer> because of its different background color :D tried footer a .. footer a.ui-link etc. but nope .. still the same colors as in the jquery mobile css
[23:01:51] <jastor> i can only assume that the jquery mobile js loads the css again ? or something other weird stuff like that
[23:28:34] <trinadh_> TAFB: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7331149/how-to-parse-returned-page-html-with-jquery-get , may this might help you reduce the requests
[23:30:08] <trinadh_> jastor: try adding the required css using jquery on body load, this might solve the issue (temporary till you get the problem with css sheets fixed)
[23:31:34] <fourcolors> I"m using this jquery file uploader https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki and for some reason I can only upload 1 photo at a time
[23:31:48] <fourcolors> is there something special I have to do to get multiple files to upload?
[23:48:01] <jastor> trinadh_: ill look into it :) ... but i find it weird that you load the css .. and then it bahves as if the JS code loads the css again
[23:48:10] <jastor> behaves*
[23:57:30] <trinadh_> jastor: check the requests to see if it is being requested twice, if it isn't then it should be a problem with the way styles are written , another thing you could do is add !important to the styles in your style sheet
[23:58:10] <cttt> hi everyone
[23:58:21] <trinadh_> jastor: make sure you are not adding that to general styles
[23:58:37] <cttt> I'm having problems, due to the fact I don't know anything about this stuff
[23:59:02] <cttt> I want this http://mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/listing-markers-in-view/ to function on this http://pinscount.com
