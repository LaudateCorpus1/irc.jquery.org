[00:02:40] <Afflicto> How is it that I sometimes can't use .css('left', '1000px'); ? it simply doesn't move. It usually works but 1 piece of my script it doesn't.
[00:08:57] <coldhead> Afflicto: check the css on that element, there must be something special about it
[00:09:18] <Afflicto> I have been battling this litte eluvise bug for several days
[00:09:22] <Afflicto> it's getting on my nerves
[00:09:39] <Afflicto> I can slide it to the right though.
[00:10:32] <coldhead> luchenbill: does that validation work? its correct if it works, although its gross to validate email addresses like that
[00:11:03] <Afflicto> Ok, it seems I can slide it anywhere I want. Thing is, I want to move it 1000 pixels to the right instantly, then animate it back to 0px. I do this my adding a class (that disables animating), then removing that class and then animating it back. It only works sometimes though.
[00:15:00] <coldhead> do you have a live demo, Afflicto ?
[00:15:12] <coldhead> it works perfectly in my imagination
[00:15:16] <coldhead> :(
[00:16:12] <coldhead> brb getting some aiiir
[00:18:32] <Afflicto> coldhead I made a video for it.
[00:24:05] <jayd3e> anyone know how to get fixed position elements to slideUp and down in conjunction with each other?
[00:27:30] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/52gF2/2/ - I got this pinterest.com sticky header + Highcharts chart.
[00:27:33] <abletony84> But why does the sticky header code mess up the chart when I change var $stickyElement = $("header") to some element that's not within that document, i.e. header#elsewhere? My sticky header and chart are in two different documents, but both share the same JS file.
[00:32:16] <Afflicto> If you know the solution or want to help me I will pay you $10 - here is the video: http://www.screenr.com/6Oz8
[00:38:07] <tdskate> Hi
[01:01:31] <erdos> HELLO!
[01:35:59] <Atty> heylo
[01:42:03] <IvanKuzev> hi
[02:18:20] <sonnie> hi, i have a group of <div class=lid id=$id> and want to create a new div with different id, any hint?
[02:20:00] <ravenzz> $('<div/>', { id: "whatever" });
[02:21:35] <sonnie> how to select all ids into an array?
[02:22:04] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/52gF2/3/ - my sticky header JS will mess up my Highcharts JS if it can't find any matching elements. How do I add a test to determine if any elements matches and if not, skip all the sticky header stuff?
[02:24:53] <ravenzz> abletony84 http://jsfiddle.net/52gF2/5/
[02:26:40] <ravenzz> abletony84 you can use length
[02:27:12] <ravenzz> if no header elements are into the page $stickyElement.length will be 0 which will evaluate to false
[02:28:02] <coldhead> ?map @ sonnie
[02:28:02] <bot-t> sonnie, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[02:28:59] <ravenzz> abletony84 anyway i'd convert it into a plugin so it could be re used
[02:29:03] <rhythem> hello
[02:29:06] <rhythem> i need some help
[02:29:09] <rhythem> please help me
[02:29:12] <ravenzz> ?ask
[02:29:13] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:29:23] <abletony84> ravenzz: that is fucking awesome man
[02:29:48] <rhythem> can anyone tell me how to make a multi parameter search box ?
[02:30:07] <abletony84> digging the simplification too.. hmm plugin you say..
[02:30:08] <ravenzz> define it
[02:30:18] <rhythem> define it ????
[02:30:30] <ravenzz> yes?
[02:30:41] <ravenzz> what is a multi parameter search box?
[02:30:51] <rhythem> um have u seen the textbox in gmail compose mailsection for email ids???
[02:31:08] <ravenzz> so this tag list
[02:31:15] <ravenzz> kind of
[02:31:45] <rhythem> yes kind of.. or if possible exactly like it
[02:31:51] <abletony84> ravenzz: actually when set to an element that doesnt exist within that document it still messes up the other js - http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/52gF2/6/
[02:31:52] <ravenzz> ok there is a cool plugin
[02:32:06] <rhythem> tell me
[02:32:29] <ravenzz> here you go http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/
[02:33:02] <rhythem> what does this plugin do/
[02:33:29] <ravenzz> see the 4th example
[02:33:48] <abletony84> ravenzz: got many documents sharing the same js and when the sticky header code cant find its element in them it messes up their other js
[02:34:17] <ravenzz> rhythem if you are willing to use a regular input text element
[02:34:30] <ravenzz> still there are plugins for that
[02:34:45] <rhythem> dude did u even read my problem ??? dis is not what i want to do
[02:34:53] <ravenzz> abletony84 ok
[02:34:59] <ravenzz> one sec
[02:35:55] <ravenzz> rhythem yes I did. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/519107/jquery-autocomplete-tagging-plug-in-like-stackoverflows-input-tags
[02:36:29] <rhythem> so how to install this plugin?
[02:36:46] <ravenzz> read the doc!
[02:36:59] <ravenzz> I am not supposed to do that for you :)
[02:37:10] <ravenzz> abletony84 yeah that make sense
[02:37:18] <coldhead> be nice, rhythem
[02:37:45] <ravenzz> abletony84 http://jsfiddle.net/52gF2/7/
[02:38:08] <rhythem> i have to make this type of thing using only jquery, php
[02:38:27] <ravenzz> you don't need php
[02:38:29] <rhythem> i cannot submit some code which i dont understand as my project
[02:38:39] <rhythem> what languages are used in this?
[02:38:40] <ravenzz> so write your own
[02:38:44] <ravenzz> javascript
[02:39:19] <rhythem> yeah i want to write my own. i just want to know the loginc behind this  plugin
[02:39:55] <ravenzz> try to think about it, or read the other plugins source
[02:40:50] <rhythem> i've been thinking since 20 hrs :D
[02:41:26] <abletony84> ravenzz: thanks a lot..
[02:42:18] <ravenzz> rhythem lol
[02:42:26] <ravenzz> abletony84 yw
[02:42:43] <rhythem> ravenzz what would be the algo behind ths ??
[02:58:53] <rhythem> how to append text to a textbox using jquery?
[02:59:09] <rhythem> @ravenzz
[03:00:41] <dabear> foo.val(foo.val() + " extra text") @ rhythem
[03:02:19] <rhythem> dabear lemme try this one
[03:02:33] <Rudeboy> My menu items are all images. What would be the best way to animate them when the mouse is over them?
[03:03:54] <rhythem> use hover function and fire a animate fucntion in it, u can use css function also Rudeboy
[03:05:50] <Rudeboy> rhythem: I was going to use css, but I want it to animate, not be a instant change. What is the best way to reference them though? Reference each image?
[03:07:31] <Rudeboy> rhythem: Also, the hover function isn't working so well, very temporemntal
[03:07:32] <rhythem> what type of animation effect you want to create?
[03:08:23] <erdos> also i find it helps to do $(this).stop().animate(.....
[03:08:47] <erdos> so you dont get the animation playing over and over if you move your mouse over the element quickly
[03:09:58] <Rudeboy> I want each image to fade a bit when hovering over it. But it only works once, then will work again later, etc, doesn't work very well at all. I think that's the ticket erdos. Although I've never really understood the $(this) syntax
[03:10:20] <Rudeboy> Would you mind giving me a quick explanation? I think that will solve my animation woes
[03:11:38] <rhythem> what $(this) will do is that it will be fired for the event that has run its parent function
[03:11:39] <rhythem> for example
[03:12:31] <rhythem> $('p').click(function(){          $(this).html("HELLO");                                });
[03:12:53] <rhythem> this will set the text of the only <p> tag that was clicked and not all.
[03:13:02] <rhythem> the <p> tags on page
[03:13:32] <Rudeboy> ok.....I'm kind of understanding
[03:13:34] <Rudeboy> I think ha ha
[03:14:04] <erdos> there's quite a lot to it but if you just think of it in it's literal sense of "this" as in the thing i'm currently operating on you should get by!
[03:14:41] <rhythem> rudeboy do u know of the animate api in jquery?
[03:14:47] <Rudeboy> no?
[03:15:11] <Rudeboy> erdos: Ha ha ok cool:) I'm going to try implement your tip quick
[03:15:44] <rhythem> ok Rudeboy
[03:15:44] <erdos> $('whatever').animate({opacity:0.8}, 'fast');
[03:16:09] <rhythem> yes fast and slow will do what you want to do.
[03:18:01] <Rudeboy> This is what I have so far, but it's only fading in, not out again on mouseleave: v
[03:18:02] <Rudeboy> http://pastebin.com/cFFegQsQ
[03:19:30] <erdos> hover is function that takes two parameters
[03:19:41] <erdos> .hover( function1, function2 );
[03:19:51] <erdos> the first is for the hover over action
[03:19:55] <erdos> the second for the hover out
[03:20:09] <erdos> you've only got the first in there
[03:20:20] <Rudeboy> erdos: Oh ok. How would I out the second in?
[03:20:33] <Rudeboy> erdos: I'm not too sure how to write it
[03:21:11] <erdos> actually at the moment your code is a bit malformed
[03:21:22] <erdos> as per above
[03:21:35] <erdos> .hover( function(){}, function(){} );
[03:21:40] <rhythem> $('#watever').hover(function(){       //  here what erdos wrote});
[03:21:48] <Rudeboy> erdos: A bit malformed? ha ha why?
[03:21:56] <rhythem> no need for the second function value
[03:22:03] <rhythem> leave it blank and remove the comma
[03:22:05] <erdos> missing the closing bracket
[03:22:36] <erdos> don't worry about that though, first make sure you understand what's going on with the hover function
[03:22:36] <Rudeboy> erdos: I've got more closing brackets at the end, that was just a section
[03:22:43] <erdos> ah right
[03:22:46] <erdos> anyway
[03:23:10] <Rudeboy> rhythem: What do you mean?
[03:23:16] <erdos> the point is that hover takes two parameters, which are functions
[03:23:21] <Rudeboy> erdos: I'll try again quick
[03:23:40] <erdos> what ever is between those curly brackets is what will be executed
[03:24:01] <erdos> .hover( function(){ put some hover in code here }, function(){ put some hover out code here } );
[03:24:03] <rhythem> Rudeoboy your code misses a closing }); for the hover function i guess
[03:27:36] <Rudeboy> Something like this? http://pastebin.com/vVi0L05S
[03:27:55] <erdos> almost
[03:28:13] <erdos> see where you've got that first 600?
[03:28:41] <erdos> that's the end of your first animate function
[03:28:45] <Rudeboy> erdos: Yes?
[03:29:27] <erdos> what you're doing there is passing another function as a third parameter to the animate function
[03:29:32] <erdos> dig?
[03:30:24] <erdos> it's a little confusing because everything is so heavily chained together in jquery, but you should always conceptualize what you're doing in "blocks"... 1 sec i'll show you
[03:37:24] <erdos> http://imgur.com/vGUmj
[03:37:34] <erdos> that's the correct code
[03:38:01] <erdos> hover takes two parameters, red is parameter 1, green is parameter 2
[03:38:22] <erdos> animate also takes two parameters, blue is param 1, yellow param 2
[03:38:37] <Rudeboy> erdos: So basically } closes the current function, and ); closes a group of functions?
[03:39:09] <erdos> yes, } closes the current function
[03:39:10] <erdos> but
[03:39:33] <erdos> ) doesn't close a group of functions, because not all functions take functions as their parameters
[03:39:43] <erdos> it's like alert("hello");
[03:39:52] <erdos> alert takes a single parameter which is a string
[03:40:11] <erdos> ) ends the list of parameters for a function call
[03:40:12] <erdos> ...
[03:40:17] <erdos> if that makes sense :P
[03:40:22] <ansolas> :)
[03:40:49] <rhythem> erdos some help please
[03:41:22] <erdos> okie dokie
[03:41:30] <erdos> just quickly though, i've got to get back to work
[03:41:44] <rhythem> my append function is not working
[03:41:47] <rhythem> lemme post th e code
[03:42:32] <Rudeboy> http://pastebin.com/Su08fwPA
[03:42:37] <rhythem> http://pastebin.com/CzmFZXRQ this here.. the append function does not append the reslut_value to the textbox autosuggest
[03:43:40] <erdos> is .autosuggest an input?
[03:43:54] <rhythem> no its an textarea
[03:44:22] <erdos> result_value definitely contains some text?
[03:44:56] <Rudeboy> erdos: Success in the city:)
[03:45:01] <Rudeboy> erdos: It's working nicely now
[03:45:10] <Rudeboy> erdos: Thanks so much for helping and explaing
[03:45:17] <rhythem> yes i tried this append("HELLO WORLD") but this also does not work;
[03:45:19] <Rudeboy> rhythem: And for all your help too :)
[03:45:26] <erdos> Rudeboy: no worries :)
[03:45:37] <rhythem> Rudeboy no problem bro
[03:45:53] <Rudeboy> Have a rad day guys, you definitely helped me out a lot :)
[03:46:55] <erdos> rhythem: hmm, maybe try $(".autosuggest").val(result_value);
[03:46:58] <ansolas> append> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/cmfca/
[03:47:16] <erdos> i don't think you'd want to append anyway since i'm guessing the result would contain the whole string
[03:47:36] <rhythem> result contains email id fetched from database
[03:47:49] <ansolas> appending a string works fine, is the returned value a plain string?
[03:48:37] <rhythem> it is a email id
[03:48:58] <ansolas> does it append this: var result_value = "moo"; ?
[03:49:00] <rhythem> its not working on chrome
[03:49:18] <erdos> ansolas example works on chrome forme
[03:49:21] <ansolas> so u can get sure that you apend works :)
[03:49:51] <rhythem> not working here
[03:50:07] <ansolas> it is working , but out of the viuew , resize the textarea
[03:50:33] <ansolas> http://jsfiddle.net/vQnwK/1/
[03:50:34] <ansolas> :)
[03:50:41] <erdos> alright i gotta get back to work
[03:50:43] <erdos> good luck!
[03:50:48] <rhythem> not here
[03:50:56] <ansolas> http://jsfiddle.net/vQnwK/1/ not working ?
[03:51:21] <ansolas> i tried it on chrome 21.0.1180.75 m wondows7 x64
[03:52:06] <rhythem> exactly same config

[03:53:26] <ansolas> http://i.imgur.com/eYkky.png
[03:53:59] <rhythem> where as attr() function is working
[03:54:33] <ansolas> is this working: var result_value = $(this).text();
[03:54:47] <ansolas> does result_value contain a value ?
[03:54:58] <rhythem> yes result_value contains a value
[03:55:06] <rhythem> i alerted it and it worked
[03:55:38] <rhythem> also $('.autosuggest')attr('value',result_value); works fine
[03:56:28] <ansolas> what happens if u set the var result_value = "test" ?
[03:56:36] <ansolas> to get sure it is a string
[03:56:46] <ansolas> does that work ?
[03:56:56] <rhythem> yes i did that also but it also dint work
[03:57:08] <ansolas> funny
[03:57:42] <ansolas> have u tried a simple test like i did on fiddle on you localhost ?
[03:57:44] <rhythem> really
[03:59:10] <rhythem> wait lemme try that
[03:59:37] <noregret> I have $('.error.contact').append(result.data).hide().fadeIn('slow'); how can I make the appended text delay for a couple of secs then disappear ?
[04:00:25] <ansolas> http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[04:00:26] <ansolas> ?
[04:00:57] <ansolas> that should do it :)

[04:05:50] <ansolas> noreg: what is the call above supposed to do ?
[04:06:05] <ansolas> append the data , hided them and then fade in ???

[04:06:33] <noregret> ansolas: it works for me, the data appears in a fadein taht's what happen
[04:06:41] <noregret> which is what i want
[04:06:46] <ansolas> ok

[04:28:07] <ansolas> http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/vQnwK/

[04:29:54] <ansolas> rhythem, u got luck with your append ?
[04:30:59] <ansolas> ok food is ready bbl
[04:36:05] <noregret> ansolas: check it again, is it the right link ? coz i don't see animate or anything.. only an append()

[05:48:11] <fosser_josh> ansolas: is jquery gives any problem while working in jsp? I wanted to use context menu in jsp for dynamically populated list. Do you have any tutorial or documentation regarding this?
[05:48:26] <ansolas> never did anything with jsp yet
[05:48:43] <wingy> ansolas: google can search ajax pages? :)
[05:48:50] <ansolas> no it cant
[05:49:02] <wingy> thought that everything after !# was searchable
[05:49:03] <ansolas> unless yopu provide html snapshots
[05:49:06] <wingy> or indexable
[05:49:23] <ansolas> angulat provides html snapshots automatically?
[05:50:14] <wingy> ansolas: what exactly is a html snapshot?
[05:50:21] <ansolas> :)
[05:50:23] <ansolas> https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/html-snapshot
[05:51:05] <ansolas> do you have an ready angular page and tried if google can index it ?
[05:53:19] <wingy> no
[05:53:31] <ansolas> the only framework i know which automatically provide html snapshots is http://meteor.com/blog/2012/08/09/search-engine-optimization
[05:53:34] <ansolas> but its quite new
[05:53:42] <ansolas> sad but true :/
[05:54:10] <ansolas> my current approch in creating indexample pages is following the hijack paradigm
[05:54:36] <ansolas> I essentially craete a "normal" page and enhance it with js if it is available
[05:55:03] <wingy> ansolas: quite popular framework
[05:55:08] <ansolas> eg preventing the default action of a href and replace contents with js instead of reloading teh whole page
[05:55:18] <ansolas> whcih angular ?
[05:55:20] <wingy> even more popular than angular
[05:55:22] <wingy> meteor
[05:55:35] <ansolas> very interesting
[05:55:35] <wingy> or at least watched a lot
[05:55:44] <ansolas> but its still quite new and rapidly changing
[05:56:59] <ansolas> I am going to built my next project with nodejs and express
[05:57:12] <ansolas> and the gui qith plain jquery
[05:57:19] <ansolas> thats the plan so far :)
[05:57:40] <ansolas> exchaninging data via socket.io roxx :)
[06:01:06] <Krambiorix> hi guys, in some code i found: 	EventManager.call(t, options, eventSources);  -> does it call a function in function EventManager?
[06:01:08] <wingy> ansolas: sweet
[06:02:37] <ansolas> nodejs + jade + stylus + expressjs + socket.io + mongodb might be a nice combination
[06:02:42] <ansolas> time will tell :)
[06:02:54] <ansolas> I am going to start with this project next week
[06:23:19] <hendry> how do i debug JSON-P errors? .error(function(x) { console.log("AJAX JSON-P error: " + x); }); // gives me "AJAX JSON-P error: object:object"
[06:31:35] <shoky> hendry: check the 2nd and 3rd arguments to the error callback
[06:32:50] <shoky> hendry: also if you want to see the actual object in the console, don't concatenate strings with +, use e.g.:  console.log('error: ', x)
[06:34:07] <shoky> Krambiorix: that calls the function EventManager (setting the context/this to t)
[06:37:23] <hendry> shoky: thanks!
[07:01:34] <ScottG> I'm sing <col> elements to help manipulate columns. It seems to work well for setting column colors properly. However, I'm trying to HIDE a column (display: none) and this doesn't seem to work. Any ideas?
[07:05:49] <shoky> ScottG: hide the column's cells. <col> is useless
[07:06:58] <shoky> (except for background color, apparently)
[07:11:48] <RandalSchwartz> 1.8 a clean drop in over 1.7?
[07:11:56] <ScottG> shoky: That's really weird that only a few styles would work...
[07:11:58] <RandalSchwartz> as in has anyone had problems?
[07:12:10] <RandalSchwartz> I'm about to upgrade a client
[07:12:30] <RandalSchwartz> and does it fix compatibility problems with safari 6?
[07:12:50] <RandalSchwartz> client has complained 1.7 broke on safari 6, without further explanation
[07:12:52] <ScottG> shoky: It would make my code look A LOT nicer. I could just access specific cols by doing col.classname instead of some weird iterating.
[07:13:00] <shoky> ScottG: no it's not. tables are made of rows, you need to deal with that ;)
[07:15:28] <ScottG> shoky: Obviously not because I can set a background color for a COLUMN and not a row. Someone up top didn't think this fancy <col> tag through.
[07:15:57] <shoky> ScottG: it was just meant as a helper tag, like i said it's pretty useless as it is
[07:20:42] <shoky> ScottG: and you don't need to do any weird iterating if you give your cells classes just like you gave your <col>s
[07:24:42] <ScottG> shoky: That's true. I'd just rather use something built-in to html that seems specifically for this
[07:25:51] <esdf> hi guys, i have an request to make, if one of you would be kind enough to make this same thing in jquery http://pastie.org/4460749 i'd do it myself but i dont have any idea about jquery or jscript
[07:31:14] <quiznilo> I've got a <select> list and some options and a jquery method for detecting change... I'm getting that old 'toLowerCase is not a function' because of some null values?
[07:31:37] <ScottG> shoky: According to the following documentation, visibility: collapse should work which is exactly what I want. http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#columns
[07:32:42] <quiznilo> is there any workaround besides make sure there are no null values in my DB? ;p
[07:33:52] <quiznilo> I took the null entries out of db, still getting it
[07:37:33] <shoky> ScottG: http://www.quirksmode.org/css/columns.html
[07:38:04] <ScottG> Oh wow this is really cool
[07:39:24] <quiznilo> is it okay to have more than one 'jQuery(document).ready() function?
[07:40:21] <shoky> esdf: something like this- http://pastie.org/4460919
[07:41:49] <shoky> esdf: but SOP might deny you from doing that..
[07:42:19] <shoky> esdf: you might need to do JSONP instead
[07:42:35] <esdf> shoky: mm i guess it is something like this. does that automatically display the stream when it goes online?
[07:42:54] <esdf> shoky: well thing is im total noob when it comes to javascript related stuff.. no clue whawt jsonp even is :D
[07:43:16] <shoky> esdf: dude they have an example right on their main API pagE: http://apiwiki.justin.tv/mediawiki/index.php/REST_API_Documentation
[07:43:27] <shoky> Here is an example using the jQuery javascript library:  $.getJSON("http://api.justin.tv/api/clip/show/1278312.json?jsonp=?", function(a){alert(a.title);});
[07:43:57] <shoky> esdf: automatically display it when it goes online? no.. does your php do that?
[07:44:01] <shoky> (i donno php really)
[07:44:19] <esdf> shoky: php cant do that
[07:44:54] <esdf> shoky: i was more of thinking on when the live status is grabbed from the api that the stream shows up on site
[07:45:00] <shoky> anyways, i did what you asked for. you'll need to learn about these things if you wanna code something that works
[07:45:16] <esdf> yeah thanks ;)
[07:45:22] <esdf> ill try to figure it out
[07:50:54] <erdos> hey is it possible use .wrap to wrap the inside of an element with a div?
[07:51:09] <erdos> i want to turn <td>helllo</td> into t
[07:51:18] <erdos> <td><div>helllo</div></td>
[07:51:23] <shoky> ?wrapInner
[07:51:24] <bot-t> .wrapInner(wrappingElement): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[07:51:35] <erdos> oh sweet! thank you shoky!
[08:03:34] <Raydiation> how can i select all items without the class read?
[08:03:45] <shoky> Raydiation: alllll items?
[08:04:12] <shoky> Raydiation: $(':not(.read)')
[08:04:18] <Raydiation> shoky: "#feed_items li:not(.read)" ?
[08:04:22] <risto> hey guys, i have a plain js problem with arrays, example: http://jsfiddle.net/9E6Xy/3/
[08:04:27] <shoky> Raydiation: looks good
[08:04:30] <Raydiation> ty
[08:04:46] <risto> can anyone tell me what im doing wrong there?
[08:05:15] <ravenzz> 1st of all you should use array literals
[08:05:28] <ravenzz> var arr = ['foo', 'bar'];
[08:05:40] <shoky> risto: you changed arr, so arr is changed
[08:05:47] <shoky> you didnt change the clone..
[08:05:54] <risto> but i copied it with slice() to the db array
[08:05:57] <shoky> so what?
[08:06:02] <risto> how can it be modified afterwards
[08:06:05] <shoky> you copied X into Y, but you changed X
[08:06:07] <shoky> not Y
[08:06:09] <shoky> so X is changed.
[08:06:23] <shoky> if you check Y it should still have the original value
[08:07:03] <shoky> ah actually you pushed a clone into db ;P
[08:07:27] <risto> im confused now :/
[08:07:34] <shoky> if you console.log(db[0]) you'll see your saved copy
[08:07:45] <shoky> dude
[08:07:47] <risto> sidenote: new Array() vs. [] - significant difference?
[08:07:53] <shoky> risto: no
[08:08:18] <shoky> you copied arr into db, then you changed arr, so why are you surprised that arr is changed?
[08:08:37] <shoky> if you change something, it is changed. regardless of if you made a copy of it somewhere else
[08:08:51] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Q8dZg/1/ - is this how I make a multistep form whose steps slide out to the left every time I press next?
[08:10:07] <risto> i tried to make a simplified example of the problem i got, but somehow the problem disappeared in the example
[08:10:22] <shoky> i assume your problem had to do with the different function scopes
[08:10:30] <shoky> but indeed in your fiddle the functions are superfluous
[08:10:47] <shoky> could've all been written in one piece and had the same effect
[08:10:55] <risto> sure
[08:11:04] <shoky> e.g.  db.push(arr.slice(); arr[2] = 'fdjskl'; console.log(arr);
[08:11:08] <risto> i didnt want to paste 200 lines of uncommented code
[08:13:00] <MeirD> Is there anyway I can use "push" to push and item to an array, and pop the first item if the list exceeds a certain limit?
[08:13:23] <MeirD> (of course I can check it myself, but wanted to know if there is a made syntax for it)
[08:14:18] <shoky> don't think there is any built-in syntax for that
[08:16:21] <Raydiation> to negate a var i can do this right? var important = ! _important;
[08:16:29] <MeirD> thnx
[08:18:44] <shoky> Raydiation: yea but know that it'll take any value in _important and treat it as a boolean, even if it wasn't one
[08:21:17] <abletony84> I'm reading at http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/javascript-best-practices/ that one should avoid global variables. Thus, is NEW at http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/DHSQL/ the right way to go about it?
[08:22:30] <ravenzz> no
[08:22:39] <ravenzz> formMultiStep is an object
[08:23:07] <ravenzz> and objects can only have key : value pairs
[08:23:45] <ravenzz> it should be a function instead
[08:24:06] <abletony84> oh ok cool
[08:25:45] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/ddpt3/
[08:29:13] <abletony84> nice rewrite..!
[08:29:35] <abletony84> i like the way you separate logical chunks of code.. even the way you do " = " instead of "="
[08:30:17] <raj> sup ya'll
[08:30:25] <ravenzz> eh it is about mental order :p
[08:32:28] <abletony84> cool
[08:38:33] <abletony84> ravenzz: is that what they call revealing module pattern?
[08:39:00] <abletony84> anyway so far this method won't hide my form - http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/Q8dZg/5/ - do i need to call the function from the outside or something?
[08:39:38] <ravenzz> yep
[08:40:05] <ravenzz> or make it auto executing
[08:40:46] <masak> given that I have a $() selection, how do I pick out the nth item, where 'n' is a variable in my code?
[08:41:43] <ravenzz> abletony84 http://blog.alexanderdickson.com/javascript-revealing-module-pattern
[08:42:28] <abletony84> nice was just about to ask, the opera page doesnt seem to mention any auto executions
[08:43:18] <ravenzz> ?eval function foo () { console.log("foo"); }
[08:43:21] <bot-t> ravenzz: undefined
[08:43:30] <ravenzz> ?eval (function foo () { console.log("foo"); })()
[08:43:30] <bot-t> ravenzz: "foo"
[08:44:57] <pawel___> hi there, there is any easy way to make some animate background? (for older version of jquery works backgroundposition plugin, but now, it doesnt)
[08:44:59] <masak> oh, just $(...)[n] seems to work.
[08:45:15] <ravenzz> abletony84 http://jsfiddle.net/Q8dZg/6/
[08:45:32] <ravenzz> or just call it formMultiStep();
[08:47:53] <Atty> need some help trying to load a form page using simplemodal... http://pastebin.com/VdadYi3F
[08:48:22] <Atty> what should I be doing I commented out what Im trying to do. everything to the first modal is working correctly.
[08:49:20] <abletony84> ravenzz: definitely the first one..
[08:51:21] <ravenzz> regarding the html, the next button should be a link which target the next step div
[08:53:12] <VX1> i got a textbox which i am getting as input a youtube video id, when you exit the box i want to get the data from the url gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/axd3S1K3fd5XQ?v=2&alt=json-in-script&callback=myfunc and via myfunc set some other values on the page, how should i call that url when exiting the textbox to process the return value ?
[08:57:32] <abletony84> ravenzz: could i add some sorta href to the button?
[09:00:44] <dabear> VX1: use .blur() , then $.getJSON(url+"callback=?", function(data){ /* here data is the response from the url*/ })
[09:00:59] <dabear> make that "&callback=?"
[09:01:20] <VX1> or is there a better way to do that without using the callback ?
[09:01:40] <dabear> nope
[09:01:50] <VX1> k ty
[09:01:52] <dabear> you would always have to use some sort of callback
[09:02:13] <dabear> even for normal json requests (above was a jsonp request)
[09:02:20] <dabear> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ for details
[09:02:50] <VX1> got it ty
[09:03:27] <MeirD> how can I select all TDs that one of their neighboring TD has a span with a certain class in it?
[09:03:48] <MeirD> for example, I wanna choose all TDs in this TR : <tr><td>blah</td><td><span class="owned"></span></td></tr>
[09:04:30] <ravenzz> abletony84 http://jsfiddle.net/Q8dZg/8/ more or less
[09:05:02] <ravenzz> oh well you don't need to select the form
[09:05:21] <Thumper> MeirD: $("span.owned").siblings("span")
[09:05:24] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/Q8dZg/9/
[09:05:58] <MeirD> thnx
[09:06:25] <ravenzz> you should add / implement the slide effect
[09:06:37] <MeirD> hmm
[09:06:53] <Thumper> MeirD: $("span.owned").closest("tr").children("td")
[09:06:54] <MeirD> I need all TDs siblings that one of the TD has a span class INSIDE of it
[09:06:57] <Thumper> Sorry that is the correct one
[09:06:59] <MeirD> thnx :)
[09:07:23] <abjorn> imsky: yo dawgg
[09:07:33] <imsky> soup abjorn
[09:07:53] <abjorn> you seen this livescript shit? I might be late to the party
[09:08:18] <imsky> yeah didn't read too much into it tho
[09:08:28] <abletony84> ravenzz: thanks a lot man for everything
[09:08:39] <abjorn> imsky: They took javascript and made it...completely illegible.
[09:08:41] <abletony84> gonna keep you in the back of my mind till i get rich, for sure
[09:08:42] <ravenzz> np you're welcome
[09:08:48] <ravenzz> ahah
[09:08:50] <abjorn> as far as i can tell
[09:08:59] <imsky> lol
[09:09:06] <imsky> To further clear things up, you can omit the parentheses when calling a function.
[09:09:06] <imsky> add 2, 3
[09:09:12] <imsky> fuck me
[09:09:15] <abjorn> I hate that
[09:09:25] <imsky> i bet it's got significant whitespace too
[09:09:30] <abjorn> lol
[09:09:30] <imsky> blocks are delimited by whitespace indentation
[09:09:33] <imsky> yap
[09:09:34] <abjorn> :3
[09:09:48] <abjorn> tbh i dont mind that, well, not in python anyways.
[09:09:52] <masak> I can't make [n] indexing work reliably on jQuery objects (in Chrome). but .slice(n, n+1) seems an adequate workaround.
[09:09:57] <imsky> its not a good design abjorn
[09:09:59] <abjorn> this looks like a dumb language
[09:10:06] <imsky> whitespace shouldn't be significant
[09:10:35] <imsky> but yeah "It is a fork of Coco which is in turn derived from CoffeeScript."
[09:10:48] <abjorn> masak: i.e. $(".selector")[n] ?
[09:10:58] <abjorn> that should work, but it'll give you a dom element not a jquery element
[09:11:05] <imsky> so it's like 0.01 * 0.01 * 0.01 of the js market share
[09:11:08] <ravenzz> .eq
[09:11:10] <ravenzz> ftw
[09:11:11] <abjorn> ^
[09:11:23] <abjorn> $(".selector").eq(n);
[09:11:56] <shoky> MeirD: $('#mytable tr:has(span.owned) > td')   note that this will go through all elements in each <tr>
[09:12:15] <masak> abjorn: ah, that explains it. so what I get back is "without magic", in some sense.
[09:12:34] <abjorn> if you think of jquery as magic, yes :p
[09:12:40] <shoky> MeirD: oh sorry, didn't see you got an answer already
[09:12:47] <masak> abjorn: :)
[09:12:48] <masak> abjorn: is there a more clever way than .slice() to index a jQuery object but preserve the magic?
[09:13:48] <abjorn> yeah, like ravenzz said, .eq
[09:13:54] <abjorn> ?eq
[09:13:54] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[09:14:00] <MeirD> thnx!
[09:14:31] <abjorn> imsky: writing raw js ftw
[09:14:46] <imsky> yeah i dunno about all these dialects
[09:14:48] <imsky> reminds me of scheme
[09:15:17] <abjorn> lol
[09:15:31] <imsky> it's all jashkenas's fault
[09:15:36] <imsky> he started this bullshit
[09:15:37] <abjorn> :p
[09:16:01] <imsky> at least things like clojurescript have some value
[09:16:04] <abjorn> yeah and now standards body is all "we gotta accommodate these transpilers!"
[09:16:27] <imsky> yeah its p crazy out there
[09:17:17] <imsky> you studying for that interview brah?
[09:18:04] <abjorn> yeah
[09:18:09] <abjorn> well, practicing
[09:19:04] <imsky> cool, what with
[09:19:14] <abjorn> c++
[09:19:20] <imsky> right on
[09:19:21] <abjorn> doing algorithms an shat
[09:21:17] <abjorn> imsky: and simultaneously defending JS's honor on #vidyadev
[09:21:22] <imsky> lol why
[09:21:33] <abjorn> BECAUSE
[09:21:37] <abjorn> I MUST PROTECT IT'S HONOR
[09:21:41] <abjorn> MY HONOR DEMANDS IT
[09:21:49] <imsky> why are the dorks in vidyadev dissing on js
[09:21:58] <abjorn> because they're fags
[09:22:03] <imsky> so stop hanging out there
[09:22:10] <abjorn> but they aren't aaalll fags
[09:22:13] <dabear> vidyadev=?
[09:22:22] <imsky> lol abjorn theres better forums for gamedevs
[09:22:32] <abjorn> *shrug*
[09:22:54] <abjorn> well, a lot of them are cool, most of them in fact, but at the same time a lot of them get too fucking opinionated about stuff without properly understanding it
[09:22:55] <mitzev_> how to i get a floating fixed box on the side
[09:22:58] <mitzev_> or a header
[09:23:02] <abjorn> aka they are 15
[09:23:05] <mitzev_> that floats above when the page is scrolled down
[09:23:10] <mitzev_> i seen a few sites with it
[09:23:15] <imsky> abjorn, lol thats pretty typical
[09:23:32] <imsky> people who write vidyagames arent exactly competent enough to be humble
[09:23:40] <abjorn> lol
[09:23:50] <abjorn> s/vidyagames/indie games/
[09:23:55] <imsky> its an 8bit platformer with zombies and vampires mang
[09:23:55] <abjorn> well, same difference
[09:23:58] <imsky> $2 on steam!!
[09:24:01] <abjorn> :D
[09:24:07] <imsky> fuck outta here
[09:24:12] <abjorn> i made it using game maker!
[09:24:17] <imsky> lol
[09:24:29] <imsky> oh have you seen the meme
[09:24:35] <abjorn> they're are some properly great programmers in the chan, though
[09:24:44] <imsky> well just like in here
[09:24:45] <imsky> natch
[09:24:51] <abjorn> CS degrees and everything.
[09:24:54] <abjorn> or at least working on one
[09:25:10] <abjorn> i decided im going back to school btw, i was kinda on the fence, but im def doin it
[09:25:23] <imsky> lol when
[09:25:34] <abjorn> well, too late to sign up for next semester, so the one after that lol
[09:25:38] <luchenbill> is this an acceptable way of doing client side validation? http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/40/
[09:25:41] <imsky> arent you going to get a jerb?
[09:25:49] <abjorn> i already has a jerb
[09:25:54] <imsky> no, the big one
[09:25:59] <abjorn> oh, yeah, well, we'll see
[09:26:04] <abjorn> im sure they'd be flexible about that
[09:26:08] <imsky> abjorn, http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/optimistic-indie-developer/photos
[09:26:41] <imsky> http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/110/466/1301627133671.jpg
[09:26:47] <imsky> i know people like that, guys and girls
[09:26:49] <abjorn> hahahaha
[09:26:54] <imsky> its..pathetic
[09:27:03] <abjorn> school i been going to has a game dev degree
[09:27:07] <abjorn> i was like "hahahaha no ill do CS"
[09:27:11] <imsky> where are you going to go
[09:27:18] <luchenbill> anyone?
[09:27:20] <abjorn> if i get the jerb? idk
[09:27:20] <shoky> luchenbill: that is ok.. but not very generic. also try clicking submit twice ;P
[09:27:32] <imsky> abjorn, just in general
[09:27:35] <abjorn> yeah luchenbill thats fine
[09:27:39] <imsky> u of t? a&m?
[09:27:46] <luchenbill> oh snap
[09:27:56] <abjorn> that's about how i usually validate clientside
[09:27:58] <luchenbill> that's exactly why I asked (is noob)
[09:28:12] <luchenbill> I mostly never validate client side
[09:28:29] <luchenbill> I just started using jquery... most of the time I just do major validation server side, since you can turn js off anyways
[09:28:39] <abjorn> imsky: well i been going to a community college cause moneys and i wasnt able to get a scholarship, but the plan has been to move up to something like UT at some point
[09:28:52] <abjorn> well, i should clarify, not able to get a BIG enough scholarship
[09:28:57] <__null> CS is too easy bro
[09:28:59] <__null> pick something hartd
[09:29:01] <imsky> lol shut up
[09:29:11] <abjorn> 0/10
[09:29:12] <imsky> ^ guy with a u of phoenix cs degree
[09:29:20] <abjorn> lol
[09:29:21] <__null> I have a degree in cs and pols
[09:29:21] <imsky> I CAN REBOOT WINDOWS WITH COMMANDLINE
[09:29:45] <imsky> gr8 bro, what university
[09:29:54] <__null> it's a liberal arts university in the states
[09:29:55] <luchenbill> I has degree in pron
[09:30:03] <imsky> __null, you cant even say the name?
[09:30:09] <__null> no
[09:30:10] <imsky> must have been pretty top tier
[09:30:42] <imsky> CS IS TOO EASY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF *mumble mumble*
[09:30:47] <__null> it was between this college and UNC
[09:30:57] <__null> if that puts it in comparison? v0v
[09:31:08] <imsky> it was between which college
[09:31:10] <imsky> wtf are you talking about
[09:31:56] <luchenbill> you see I tried pushing the error into an array, but when you validate it would write each error two times for each input :(
[09:32:18] <imsky> abjorn, does your junior college have a computer degree?
[09:32:30] <imsky> or actually..do they have any credits that transfer
[09:32:50] <__null> usually switching colleges means losing a semester in credits
[09:33:57] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/38/
[09:34:01] <luchenbill> why would it do that?
[09:34:44] <abjorn> imsky: It's actually pretty badass for a community college, their credits transfer pretty much everywhere, they use UT's curriculum, and quite a few UT profs teach there on the side.
[09:34:58] <imsky> yeah same sitch in this state
[09:35:04] <imsky> so take some intro cs courses and transfer
[09:35:10] <abjorn> that was the plan
[09:35:12] <abjorn> I've taken a couple
[09:35:21] <abjorn> they were joke-worthy, but eh what do you expect from intro
[09:35:28] <imsky> hmm doesnt sound good
[09:35:32] <imsky> are you just humblebragging
[09:35:35] <shoky> luchenbill: don't use document.write
[09:35:45] <abjorn> no, intro to programming was seriously a joke
[09:36:12] <imsky> well then do maths
[09:36:13] <luchenbill> shoky I was just trying to get it to function correctly... update 40 is more along the lines of what I want
[09:36:19] <abjorn> some african dude teaching that you could never understand, he just gave you the c++ code (after explaining it, incorrectly) and you copied it, compiled it, then gave to him
[09:36:36] <luchenbill> i'm just trying to write a simple validation (new to jquery) and be "correct" with how I do it
[09:36:54] <imsky> abjorn, sounds p ghetto, so you just wanna skip ahead to actual university?
[09:37:04] <shoky> luchenbill hold on
[09:37:40] <luchenbill> I tried going in at the beginning of each if and set the array to error = []; but that didn't seem to fix the problem.. oh wait how about .remove the .after text idk
[09:37:51] <luchenbill> oh yeah because it's not even using the array on update 40
[09:38:45] <abjorn> imsky: lol we'll see
[09:39:14] <shoky> luchenbill: here's one way, it can be improved further..  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7uhzx/41/
[09:39:17] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/42/
[09:40:21] <luchenbill> shoky wow that is way nicer than waht I have haha
[09:40:55] <luchenbill> shoky is it somewhat acceptable to do it like http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/42/ ?
[09:41:11] <shoky> luchenbill: sure that's fine
[09:41:20] <luchenbill> super sloppy i'm sure
[09:41:41] <shoky> not as it is, but it'd get sloppy as you add more and more elements and validation-types
[09:42:15] <luchenbill> yeah exactly, I was wondering how to streamline it for whole forms and apperently your method is quite nice
[09:42:16] <luchenbill> :)
[09:44:04] <luchenbill> so for simplicity you used el in place of this, which it's literally just to save time when writing all the if's right?
[09:46:34] <luchenbill> shoky wow that's nice ty again
[09:46:58] <shoky> i did el = $(this)  , so i don't have to put $(this) everywhere, not just to save time but also because $(this) creates a new jquery object each time
[09:47:40] <luchenbill> right so for "each" element that it goes through, this is that elements specific object
[09:47:57] <shoky> yeah, the .each() sets 'this' to the current element in the loop
[09:48:17] <shoky> (just like .on() sets 'this' to be the element that the event occured on)
[09:48:54] <luchenbill> I recently started seeing the oop power of js/jquery and soon i'm going to start using node...
[09:49:16] <shoky> it's not really the oop that gives the power
[09:49:23] <shoky> it's the functional stuff
[09:49:34] <luchenbill> yeah because everything is an object, and every object has a prototype
[09:49:46] <luchenbill> it's insane really
[09:49:57] <shoky> ;P
[09:50:27] <luchenbill> :D
[09:52:39] <luchenbill> so in update /41/ the nameRegEx and emailRegEx variables are considered 'global'? they are at the doccument level?
[09:52:44] <luchenbill> -
[09:53:26] <\n> hi :)
[09:53:29] <shoky> nope they're local to the function they're in (the .ready() callback)
[09:53:29] <\n> yay, jQuery 1.8.0!
[09:53:36] <\n> when was it released?
[09:53:47] <shoky> \n like 2 days ago
[09:53:49] <luchenbill> \n I think within the last couple days
[09:53:59] <\n> oh ok :)
[09:54:08] <shoky> but, yay
[09:56:20] <sviatovigt> how can I check if an element looses focus?
[09:59:26] <imsky> ?blur @ sviatovigt
[09:59:27] <bot-t> sviatovigt, .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[09:59:56] <luchenbill> shoky I think i'm going to try that now, using focus and blur to call functions for validation :)
[10:00:15] <luchenbill> shouldn't be too much harder
[10:02:24] <sviatovigt> thank you
[10:03:51] <shoky> luchenbill: sec
[10:04:00] <shoky> luchenbill: got a nicer fiddle fo ru
[10:04:15] <luchenbill> alright sir :)

[10:19:53] <sviatovigt> I put some html in
[10:20:17] <Sebwoh> mootools is still used?! :)
[10:20:39] <sviatovigt> no it's not
[10:22:00] <kevinquinnyo> i need some general advice, i'm hacking/playing with Firebug on a site that has draggable objects.  i can move them manually with .css(), but when i do this, and manually hit the "Save" button, they don't take.. i think i'm not really updating the attributes
[10:22:04] <RandalSchwartz> not since that mad cow disease scare
[10:22:25] <RandalSchwartz> I don't see any div elements in the HTML box
[10:22:31] <RandalSchwartz> why not flesh it out so we can see?
[10:22:33] <sviatovigt> just a sec
[10:23:17] <RandalSchwartz> that blur function isn't going to do much good
[10:23:23] <RandalSchwartz> as in, it'll never run
[10:23:38] <RandalSchwartz> well, it'll run on the empty set of focusObject
[10:24:06] <RandalSchwartz> probably need to add something inside your click handler instead
[10:24:13] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/fVveY/2/
[10:24:48] <sviatovigt> RandalSchwartz: can you please explain?
[10:24:58] <sviatovigt> the event is never triggered
[10:25:01] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[10:25:08] <RandalSchwartz> as expected :)
[10:25:17] <RandalSchwartz> when .blur runs, $focusobject is always null
[10:25:29] <RandalSchwartz> it doesn't magically re-run later when you change $focusobject
[10:26:14] <RandalSchwartz> you need to rethink your events to something that can be described as actual events :)
[10:26:30] <sviatovigt> that's not true
[10:26:41] <sviatovigt> that's a var defined in my javascript
[10:26:45] <sviatovigt> look careful
[10:26:55] <sviatovigt> that will keep it's value
[10:26:56] <RandalSchwartz> Yes.  and the value of that thing is null to start
[10:27:04] <RandalSchwartz> and will be so when .blur() runs the one and only time
[10:27:12] <RandalSchwartz> it won't have a value until something is clicked
[10:27:13] <sviatovigt> no it's not
[10:27:17] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:27:18] <RandalSchwartz> but nothing *re-runs* the .blur() call
[10:27:46] <RandalSchwartz> so you need to work out your actual event sequences
[10:27:57] <sviatovigt> no I don't
[10:28:02] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/fVveY/3/
[10:28:05] <sviatovigt> look
[10:28:05] <RandalSchwartz> well - then, keep it broken. :)
[10:28:41] <RandalSchwartz> sure - the click runs.  but nothing re-runs .blur on focusObject now
[10:28:41] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:28:45] <sviatovigt> other opinions
[10:28:56] <RandalSchwartz> focusObject was null when .blur() was called
[10:28:59] <RandalSchwartz> therefore, it's attached to nothing
[10:29:14] <sviatovigt> if I click the bigbutton
[10:29:20] <RandalSchwartz> there are no blur events registered
[10:29:22] <sviatovigt> and then I click outside
[10:29:31] <sviatovigt> clicking outside is a blur?
[10:29:34] <RandalSchwartz> yes
[10:29:39] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:29:42] <sviatovigt> click the button
[10:29:56] <RandalSchwartz> I did.  you have a click event
[10:30:02] <RandalSchwartz> but you have no blur events
[10:30:11] <sviatovigt> and focusObject will be div.class whatever
[10:30:22] <RandalSchwartz> sure.
[10:30:30] <sviatovigt> if I click outside of that div.class whatever
[10:30:37] <luchenbill> NICE shoky thx! :D
[10:30:39] <sviatovigt> it should call the blur
[10:30:40] <RandalSchwartz> but you never called $(div.class whatever).blur() at any time
[10:30:51] <RandalSchwartz> so you don't have a blur event.  *at all*
[10:30:52] <sviatovigt> $(focusObject).blur(function() {
[10:31:03] <RandalSchwartz> right.  when THAT was executed, focusObject was null
[10:31:10] <RandalSchwartz> how many times do I need to repeat that. :)
[10:31:19] <RandalSchwartz> think about the order of execution
[10:31:32] <sviatovigt> http://jsfiddle.net/fVveY/5/
[10:31:37] <sviatovigt> click the big button
[10:31:38] <RandalSchwartz> .blur doesn't magically watch the variables it was called on. :)
[10:31:40] <sviatovigt> click outseide
[10:31:52] <sviatovigt> and that click the big button again
[10:31:57] <sviatovigt> and look into the console
[10:32:12] <sviatovigt> and then tell me it's null
[10:32:26] <quiznilo> I finally took the <script>var GB_ROOT_DIRECTORY</script> out of the header, and the GB scrips and I quit getting that jquery toLower error... strange
[10:32:48] <luchenbill> shoky you around?
[10:32:55] <RandalSchwartz> yes - you're logging focusObject
[10:33:00] <RandalSchwartz> you are CHANGING focusObject in the click
[10:33:04] <sviatovigt> so it's not null
[10:33:05] <RandalSchwartz> but nothing *calls* .blur again
[10:33:13] <RandalSchwartz> you are calling .blur TOO EARLY
[10:33:20] <RandalSchwartz> you're calling it when focusObject is null
[10:33:26] * RandalSchwartz wonders how many MORE times he needs to repeat that
[10:33:47] <RandalSchwartz> think of the order of execution
[10:33:56] <sviatovigt> then could you please tell me where should I call it?
[10:35:42] <abjorn> imsky: lol sorry, stopped paying attention. Yeah I was just thinking of that old meme for some reason

[10:39:22] <sviatovigt> ok
[10:39:23] <sviatovigt> thanks
[10:41:14] <shoky> luchenbill yea
[10:43:52] <luchenbill> so what is that top part?
[10:44:05] <luchenbill> array?
[10:44:52] <shoky> luchenbill: it's an object (a map). with keys being the validation type, and the values being objects with 2 fields: str and check
[10:49:24] <luchenbill> how does it work though?
[10:49:34] <luchenbill> I mean I see you call validations? but how does it know which ones to use
[10:50:05] <shoky> luchenbill: for each input, i do an inner loop on the validations map, going through each of the key/value pairs
[10:50:37] <shoky> and checking if the current input element has the class name (which is identical to the validation "type")
[10:51:14] <shoky> that's the  if (el.hasClass(type) ..
[10:51:49] <SkiOne> hi I am getting a really wierd error in chrome with jqueryui and uploadify, anyone familar? I can give details but its not a code error on my part
[10:52:12] <SkiOne> http://pastebin.com/mL8vTiFJ
[10:56:43] <true_techie> why would jquery countdown display the date and time in chrome but show NAN in firefox?
[10:57:08] <true_techie> by keith-wood i.e
[10:58:23] <Atty> hey anyone got a few minutes to help me out with a jquery modal
[10:58:27] <luchenbill> I guess I understand i'm still a bit confused about the type part
[10:58:29] <shoky> luchenbill: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/7uhzx/44/  this is a bit better, now it doesnt go through ALL validation types for each element, but only those it needs to
[10:59:57] <shoky> luchenbill: $.each works on an array or an object. for arrays the callback arguments will be: the index, and the value.  for objects the arguments it's pretty much the same except instead of an index you get the key
[11:00:43] <shoky> luchenbill: so  when i put function(type, validation) { ... }  as the callback to $.each,  'type' gets the key, 'validation' gets the value (which is the validation object)
[11:01:14] <shoky> luchenbill: but in the newest fiddle i do $.each over an array not an object, so it's back to index & value
[11:03:39] <Atty> http://pastie.org/4461776
[11:03:50] <Atty> My modal shows up but my html doesn't
[11:04:47] <Atty> even though it logs my html to the console..
[11:04:59] <Atty> <-- still learning and could use some help..
[11:05:52] <shoky> Atty: you might want to say what plugin you're using.. jquery doesn't have a "modal"
[11:06:18] <|PiP|> anyone know why event handlers bound through jQuery ready can't be executed? http://pastie.org/4461783
[11:06:38] <await> Is there a way to watch all triggered events as they happen?
[11:07:15] <Atty> simplemodal is what im using
[11:10:06] <SkiOne> Atty try putting your html inside a div and then popup the div
[11:10:16] <luchenbill> so with validations it's just a key value pair, can be an object or an array so 'require' : { functions etc here }?
[11:10:39] <sebwoh-ger> luchenbill: html5 ;p
[11:10:50] <sebwoh-ger> type="email" required="required"
[11:10:55] <Atty> Skione Im really pretty new can you elaborate..
[11:10:58] <luchenbill> sebwoh-ger not talking about that sir
[11:11:26] <sebwoh-ger> $("input[required="required"]").doSomething()
[11:11:41] <luchenbill> and in this case there's an object with a property of require: then there's 2 properties for require, str: and check: ?
[11:11:42] <SkiOne> Atty I dont use the library you are using but with Jquery UI you place your html inside a <div></div> and hide it then call the dialog open method
[11:13:13] <Atty> I thought I did
[11:14:08] <luchenbill> shoky sorry i'm just tryign to break it down haha http://jsfiddle.net/7uhzx/45/
[11:14:15] <luchenbill> looks like my thinking is half assed alright
[11:14:42] <SkiOne> Atty what is the  div that contains the html? also on line 34 there is closing div tag without an open one?
[11:15:21] <Atty> take a look here skione www.ferrellinternetmedia.com/cloud-cal/group_test.cfm
[11:15:46] <Atty> you can see it in action there. im clicking the edit icon on the rows.
[11:15:48] <SkiOne> is this div for your dialog? <div class="edit_page_dialog"></div>
[11:16:01] <Atty> yes
[11:16:07] <SkiOne> there is no html inside it
[11:16:20] <SkiOne> I would think there should be, at least thats how jquery ui works
[11:16:31] <Atty> because im using $.get(edit_group.cfm, function dat
[11:16:49] <Atty> im loading the data remotely or trying to..
[11:17:42] <shoky> luchenbill: well you got the alert right so you know how to access the nested fields :P
[11:17:42] <Atty> the console appears to grab the html from the remote call..
[11:17:46] <SkiOne> if you put html in the div does it show Atty?
[11:18:35] <Atty> check page
[11:18:44] <Atty> i put test in the div
[11:18:52] <Atty> and it doesnt even hide the div.
[11:19:10] <SkiOne> display: none
[11:20:57] <Atty> lol misspelled  one sec
[11:21:47] <Atty> ok it doesn't show my text in the modal.
[11:21:53] <Atty> or dialog
[11:22:20] <SkiOne> are you married to this plugin?
[11:23:08] <Atty> I think so in this template im using. I really just didnt want to code a bunch of forms again pretty much heh
[11:23:38] <SkiOne> cause I would suggest jquery ui, its what I use for all my modal stuff

[11:41:57] <mobedigg> Hello, if I have multiple forms on my page and all forms have class="form1" and I use this $(".form1").submit(function(){}); to work with submited forms how to define what form was submitted? I can't use id's
[11:42:24] <SkiOne> a hidden field?
[11:42:46] <SkiOne> or grab the id after the submit?
[11:43:00] <SkiOne> or custom tag
[11:44:50] <mobedigg> thanks, good ideas
[11:54:03] <SoleSoul> Hi. I want to fade in some elements on the page. If the element was previously faded out it works, but elements which were set by css to opacity: 0 won't appear when I do fadeIn on them. What should I change for it to work?
[11:55:23] <blommer> I have a responsive website that I'm trying to target for desktop and mobile (mainly blackberrry mobile)
[11:56:05] <blommer> I have a form that geocodes an address if the blackberry's geolocation is turned off
[11:56:38] <blommer> but it seems impossible to prevent the blackberry from refreshing the page after submitting the form
[11:56:46] <blommer> even using return false or
[11:56:55] <devslash> i have a div named jp-ciurrent-time i want to get its value i did $(".jp-current-time") but how do i get the actual value
[11:58:16] <blommer> event.stopPropagation(); won't work either
[11:58:40] <devslash> can anyone help me out
[11:59:16] <rmurphey> what do you mean by value, devslash ?
[11:59:23] <devslash> the value
[11:59:28] <devslash> it holds a time value
[11:59:31] <devslash> 1:30
[11:59:31] <rmurphey> div's don't have values
[11:59:35] <blommer> textbox?
[11:59:42] <devslash> no
[11:59:43] <rmurphey> you mean the contents of the div?
[11:59:47] <devslash> its an ordered list
[11:59:49] <devslash> yes
[11:59:56] <rmurphey> ?html @ devslash
[11:59:57] <bot-t> devslash, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:00:11] <rmurphey> is it a div or is it an ordered list?
[12:02:03] <joey77> does anyone know when short polling a server starts to become too slow? For example, is checking the database every 5 seconds for a million users too much?
[12:02:09] <salazr_> anyone has experience with the youtube player js api?
[12:03:55] <rmurphey> joey77: depends a whole lot on what "checking the database" means
[12:05:26] <joey77> rmurphey, pretend it means displaying new tweets from twitter
[12:06:24] <rmurphey> displaying new tweets for a given user? or just new tweets?
[12:06:25] <rmurphey> i mean
[12:07:02] <rmurphey> my point is that the answer to your questin depends entirely on how fast the particular operation you're doing is, your caching strategy, and a whole lot of other things that have very little to do with the actual js polling
[12:07:14] <joey77> new tweets with a specific hashtag
[12:08:52] <LukasLt> Hello
[12:09:12] <LukasLt> Is the room also deals with jQuery mobile issues?
[12:09:17] <LukasLt> :)
[12:10:06] <LukasLt> I'm working on http://test.stu.lt/mini-mob/ and the car in the middle has to move sideways on swipe
[12:10:35] <LukasLt> It kind of works using swipeleft/right, but transitions are not smooth :/
[12:10:37] <joey77> rmurphey, for the average site just getting new messages from the database(the frequency of new messages being similar to a popular hashtag on twitter) what would be the ballpark limits?
[12:11:06] <LukasLt> is there anyeasy way to make it move depending on how far away the finger drags?
[12:11:15] <Norbo11> how can  i get the value of a dropdown select element?
[12:11:16] <Krambiorix_> does anyone know in fullcalendar what's the difference between eventRender and eventClick?
[12:12:10] <rmurphey> joey77: my best answer is "try it and see"
[12:12:57] <systemfault> Norbo11: The stupidest answer you can think of is the right one...
[12:13:06] <ak> any quick ways to get from a string all unique characters?
[12:13:10] <Norbo11> .value?
[12:13:16] <Norbo11> i tried that, isnt working
[12:13:21] <systemfault> Norbo11:  .value is pure DOM
[12:13:23] <joey77> rmurphey, I would but I don't want to waste my time if it will be too slow in the long run. I am trying to do it with node.js right now, but it is more complicated and I would like to try it with short polling if possible
[12:13:50] <Norbo11> im new to JavaScript and JQuery so forgive the low level question.
[12:13:54] <systemfault> Norbo11: In jQuery, you can get the value with .prop('value') but .val() is the prefered way
[12:14:05] <rmurphey> joey77: why not use socket.io if you're using node?
[12:14:07] <Norbo11> well, that isnt working :/
[12:14:24] <rmurphey> Norbo11: can you make a fiddle that shows what's not working?
[12:14:31] <Norbo11> im talking about getting the value of an <option> element.
[12:14:38] <Norbo11> <option value="town">SomeText</option>
[12:14:41] <Norbo11> i want to get "sometext"
[12:14:49] <Norbo11> .val() seems to just return ""
[12:14:58] <rmurphey> Norbo11: you need to call .val() on the select
[12:15:12] <rmurphey> if you're trying to get the value of the currently selected otions
[12:15:14] <rmurphey> option
[12:15:35] <Norbo11> hmh
[12:15:41] <Norbo11> then maybe something is wrong with my loop:
[12:15:49] <Norbo11> http://pastie.org/4462079
[12:16:14] <Norbo11> am i doing that correctly?
[12:16:17] <joey77> rmurphey, I am using socket.io
[12:16:25] <Norbo11> i tried including an alert box inside that, and it loops infinitely
[12:16:56] <rmurphey> joey77: then why are you polling?
[12:18:12] <joey77> rmurphey, i'm not yet. I'm just thinking about doing it instead if I can't get socket.io working properly. I just want to know how large my site can get before I run into problems
[12:18:28] <Norbo11> anyone?
[12:18:46] <rmurphey> Norbo11: your pastie seems incomplete
[12:18:59] <Norbo11> yeah, im just showing my loop
[12:19:03] <Norbo11> is that the correct way to do it?
[12:19:04] <rmurphey> also, a jsfiddle that demonstrates the code (not) working with your html would be useful
[12:19:28] <rmurphey> Norbo11: you should use $.fn.each to iterate over jquery selections
[12:19:37] <rmurphey> ?each @ Norbo11
[12:19:38] <bot-t> Norbo11, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[12:20:01] <Norbo11> hm ill try that
[12:24:08] <Norbo11> how can i get the nth child of suggestionRows?
[12:24:19] <Norbo11> i saw this
[12:24:20] <Norbo11> http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[12:24:31] <Norbo11> but not sure how to use it on an already created JQuery object
[12:25:47] <rmurphey> ?eq @ Norbo11
[12:25:48] <bot-t> Norbo11, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:26:03] <rmurphey> Norbo11: have you tried reading through jqfundamentals.com or similar?
[12:26:16] <Norbo11> im reading eloquent java
[12:26:20] <Norbo11> but not far through it
[12:26:25] <Norbo11> javascript* not java
[12:26:33] <rmurphey> it's a great book
[12:26:41] <rmurphey> but jqfundamentals will help you with this jquery stuff
[12:27:01] <rmurphey> it's not particularly long
[12:28:17] <Norbo11> ill have alook at that, rmurphey, ty
[12:28:25] <Norbo11> for now i just really want to get this finished
[12:28:30] <Norbo11> and i have no idea whats wrong
[12:29:23] <devslash> if i have a div that i access by doing $("#currentlyPlaying") how do i set the display property to none
[12:29:56] <shoky> devslash: .addClass() or .css()
[12:30:07] <Norbo11> also rmurphey, .eq isnt what  i needed
[12:30:10] <devslash> .css("none") ?
[12:30:10] <Norbo11> I just have ONE element
[12:30:16] <Norbo11> and i need to get the nth child of that element
[12:30:20] <shoky> devslash: your guess is wrong
[12:30:26] <shoky> ?css @ devslash
[12:30:27] <bot-t> devslash, .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[12:30:46] <rmurphey> Norbo11: then you are probably looking for .find()
[12:30:59] <Norbo11> ?find @ Norbo11
[12:31:00] <bot-t> Norbo11, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:31:07] <rmurphey> but, seriously, please take some time to learn this stuff
[12:31:09] <rmurphey> :)
[12:31:41] <Norbo11> will do :/
[12:31:58] <Norbo11> its just that im trying to learn html, php, javascript, jquery and css all at the same time :p
[12:32:01] <Norbo11> it all gets quite confusing
[12:32:23] <digs> What in general would be the algorhythm to make the "copy down" work for this case? http://imagebin.org/224320 -- Here is a code example of the class structure: http://jsfiddle.net/Bzw9J/
[12:32:39] <Norbo11> so uh.. rmurphey
[12:33:00] <Norbo11> myElement.find("nth-child(2)");
[12:33:39] <shoky> Norbo11: that looks for an <nth-child(2)> element or something
[12:34:00] <Norbo11> eh, so how can i get the nth child then
[12:34:09] <shoky> Norbo11: http://jqfundamentals.com
[12:34:18] <Norbo11> i dont have time to read a book right now..
[12:34:19] <digs> Sorry, forgot the copy down links. http://jsfiddle.net/Bzw9J/1/
[12:34:21] <Norbo11> i just want this done
[12:34:32] <shoky> ":nth-child(2)"
[12:34:32] <Krambiorix_> hi i try to alert in the on click event but it doesn't alert anything. The id's with the table rows are correct.... http://pastebin.com/KPkY1jky
[12:34:57] <shoky> ?nth-child @ Norbo11
[12:34:58] <bot-t> Norbo11, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[12:35:10] <Norbo11> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: :nth-child
[12:35:30] <Norbo11> nevermind, fixed
[12:35:32] <SkiOne> OK so this is why uploadify isn't working: http://chrome.blogspot.com/ (I think)(
[12:35:38] <Norbo11> but its still not doing what i want it to do
[12:35:42] <Norbo11> ill just make a jsfiddle
[12:36:15] <Krambiorix_> anyone??
[12:36:32] <Krambiorix_> imho it should work
[12:37:12] <shoky> Krambiorix_: alert('gt')  will alert the string "gt" ..
[12:37:29] <Krambiorix_> shoky, i just test if the on click event works
[12:37:32] <Norbo11> http://jsfiddle.net/3Lg9e/
[12:37:36] <Norbo11> anyone?
[12:38:20] <Norbo11> basically, its supposed to remove the rows that are not supposed to be displayed
[12:38:31] <Norbo11> you choose whats supposed to be displayed with the dropdown option field.
[12:38:43] <Krambiorix_> shoky, can i do it like that? The alert isn't being performed
[12:39:59] <shoky> Krambiorix_: .on('click', function() { ... } ) is correct, yes
[12:40:18] <Krambiorix_> shoky, why doesn't it work then?
[12:40:50] <Krambiorix_> shoky, can i bind the event on the element with the element define like this? var element = $('#'+allids[j].sid);
[12:41:40] <digs> Here is my attempt to solve the problem and where I get stuck: http://jsfiddle.net/Bzw9J/3/
[12:41:54] <Norbo11> ?nth-child
[12:41:55] <bot-t> :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[12:42:14] <devslash> shaky how do i get the length of $("#jqueryFileTree li") ? I tried doing $("#jqueryFileTree li").attr('length'); but that isn't corect
[12:46:09] <shoky> Norbo11: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/3Lg9e/1/
[12:46:20] <Krambiorix_> shoky any other idea?
[12:46:22] <jonno11> hi - if I select elements like this: $('li') - Once I've added an extra <li> element, obviously the selector won't apply to it. Is there any way to sort-of bind the selector to it?
[12:46:25] <shoky> Krambiorix_: if that id is correct then you can, yes...
[12:49:08] <Krambiorix_> is it possible to do this on a table row ? tr.html()
[12:49:24] <shoky> if tr is a jquery object
[12:49:52] <Krambiorix_> shoky, sorry i meant $('#'+trid).html()
[12:50:08] <Krambiorix_> i want to see what's in the table row
[12:50:25] <shoky> Krambiorix_: if trid is correct, that'll give you the inner html..
[12:50:29] <Norbo11> thank you shoky
[12:50:31] <Norbo11> that makes sense
[12:52:31] <Norbo11> so erm
[12:52:39] <Norbo11> from what  i gather
[12:52:46] <Norbo11> when .filter returns false, thats when you preform the action?
[12:53:08] <Norbo11> or no
[12:53:13] <shoky> Norbo11: filter keeps the elements for which you return true
[12:53:13] <Norbo11> .hide() returns something?
[12:53:34] <shoky> and then i show() on the filtered list
[12:53:48] <Norbo11> ah now i understand
[12:53:51] <Norbo11> first you hide all the rows
[12:54:00] <Norbo11> then you filter the ones that have the type equal to the chosen type
[12:54:03] <Norbo11> and then you show all of those
[12:54:09] <Norbo11> that helped a lot, thank you
[13:04:57] <clone1018> So I'm trying to embed two embed widgets in a page, but for some reason the animations only work on the LAST widget and no other, here's an example, http://fiddle.jshell.net/clone1018/EtvhS/show/light/
[13:09:01] <Krambiorix> shoky, can you take a look at this? http://pastebin.com/WM39qGU0
[13:09:16] <Norbo11> shoky: I changed this line in the script you gave me: return $(this).children().eq(1).text() == type
[13:09:21] <Norbo11> to this: return $(this).children().eq(1).text() == type || type == "All";
[13:09:30] <Norbo11> and now it isnt working (i added an All option)
[13:09:36] <Norbo11> im not sure why
[13:09:43] <kontoo> just wanted to report a thing that may be an issue: deleting an item from a collection in a $.each loop in FIREFOX (not chrome) leads to a call of the iterator function with value=null
[13:10:38] <abletony84> At http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/uycPf/2/ - why does multistep form sliding stop working after the 2nd step when I change $nextStep.show(); to $nextStep.show("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1000);? I'm trying to create a nice slide-to-the-left thing going here like you see in all them Android apps.
[13:11:32] <abletony84> * why does my
[13:14:21] <ak> hm
[13:15:00] <shoky> Norbo11: link
[13:17:08] <Norbo11> fixed it now :)
[13:17:32] <Norbo11> by the way, what IDE do you use for JQuery/JavaScript?
[13:17:32] <Krambiorix> shoky, http://pastebin.com/bBg5PrRR
[13:18:05] <shoky> Norbo11: a text editor, usually. sometimes WebStorm
[13:18:15] <Norbo11> damn
[13:18:25] <Norbo11> im a java dev, who uses Eclipse
[13:18:33] <shoky> ew
[13:18:40] <Norbo11> and im used to my proposals and all that
[13:18:51] <Norbo11> its annoying not seeing all the functions available to me in my actual editor
[13:19:16] <shoky> WebStorm helps some with that (i'm sure there are eclipse plugins too)
[13:19:25] <shoky> but javascript is just not built for that
[13:19:32] <Krambiorix> shoky, this would be correct , right? http://pastebin.com/bBg5PrRR
[13:19:45] <shoky> Krambiorix: stop it, how the hell would i know
[13:20:42] <shoky> Krambiorix: oh its a new one. element.id is wrong..  element.attr('id') .. but you already know the id :\
[13:21:01] <digs> Okay, this works to copy down to the next field... how do I get it to copy down to ALL fields until the end? There will be an unknown number of rows. http://jsfiddle.net/Bzw9J/7/
[13:21:12] <Krambiorix> shoky, i just want to check if it exists by checking the id
[13:21:14] <ak> abletony84: it works for me local
[13:22:44] <ak> abletony84: something with this is wrong: $nextStep.show("slide", { direction: "left" }, 1000);
[13:23:47] <shoky> ?nextAll @ digs
[13:23:48] <bot-t> digs, .nextAll([selector]): Get all following siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/nextAll/
[13:23:57] <digs> Sweet.
[13:24:00] <digs> Thanks.
[13:24:37] <shoky> Krambiorix: check element.length to see if it found anything
[13:24:52] <abletony84> ak: yup i too think that is the problem
[13:24:57] <Krambiorix> shoky,  0
[13:25:02] <shoky> Krambiorix: then it didn't find anything
[13:25:05] <Sicp> line 15 doesn't have any effect, why is that? http://pastebin.com/7aXuekLB
[13:25:22] <sonotos> Norbo11: are you searching a good js plugin for eclipse?
[13:25:25] <abletony84> ak: im looking at http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/06/07/fancy-sliding-form-with-jquery/ but it seems only to complicate things
[13:25:31] <Sicp> it should be highlighting the paragraphs at lines 30, 31 and 33..
[13:25:34] <Norbo11> sonotos: possibly.
[13:25:48] <sonotos> have you allready tried aptana?
[13:25:52] <Norbo11> nope
[13:25:58] <sonotos> webtools in eclipse suck for js
[13:26:08] <Sicp> ("p:not(p:eq(2))"), paragraphs that are not paragraphs indexed at 2
[13:26:14] <sonotos> http://www.aptana.com/
[13:26:37] <Norbo11> they do suck indeed
[13:27:02] <sonotos> well opening a small js file an editing rises my cpu to 100%
[13:27:11] <sonotos> feels like fast typing 30 years ago
[13:27:18] <sonotos> an even there the editors where faster
[13:27:45] <ak> abletony84: you need to create this animation somehow
[13:27:49] <Norbo11> HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS
[13:27:54] <Norbo11> hell yes
[13:27:56] <Norbo11> this is what i needed
[13:28:13] <sonotos> i don't even understand why, as you mentioned the default editor not even provides some useable autocomplete
[13:28:33] <Norbo11> yeah
[13:28:35] <sonotos> Norbo11: you can also try netbeans, i has also a good js support
[13:28:39] <systemfault> I don't think any dynamic typing programming langage can get decent IDE support.
[13:28:43] <sonotos> much better than the def in eclipse
[13:28:49] <Norbo11> im installing aptana right now
[13:28:54] <Norbo11> and i dont really want to get into netbeans
[13:29:04] <Norbo11> i prefer eclipse over netbeans in terms of java development
[13:29:31] <systemfault> I'm a fan of IntelliJ so I use jetbrains IDEs for most of my work
[13:29:44] <sonotos> Norbo11: last time i tried aptana it reduced the search in eclipse, thats the only issue i had with aptana so far
[13:29:54] <abletony84> ak: oh ok.. hmmm
[13:29:54] <systemfault> PHPStorm/Webstorm are probably the best IDEs I've seen
[13:30:05] <sonotos> systemfault: well it's ok if the IDE uses the XDoc comments
[13:30:21] <sonotos> so you can define what the things sould be
[13:30:23] <systemfault> sonotos: Right
[13:30:33] <shoky> Sicp: $('p:not(:eq(2))')
[13:30:51] <sonotos> as long your code is not so bad that even you don't know what it should be
[13:31:00] <Krambiorix> shoky it's really weird , it does exist, i can look it up in the firebug DOM
[13:31:04] <digs> if you are nested pretty deep and you want to traverse up the dom until you find a class... how would you do that instead of doing something like $(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent()
[13:31:06] <sonotos> but then you have other much bigger problems hrhr
[13:31:08] <Sicp> I saw it being done with the second p, shoky, and it worked
[13:31:22] <tw2113> yo shoky
[13:31:24] <Sicp> that's how I wanted to do it at first as well, without the second p
[13:31:33] <shoky> Sicp: actually i see that it changed with 1.8
[13:31:44] <Sicp> yes I'm using 1.8
[13:31:56] <Sicp> the example was using 1.3
[13:32:08] <tw2113> ouch
[13:32:26] <sonotos> systemfault: well phpstorm was also interesting, i was just missing the multi project support
[13:32:31] <sonotos> that was fatal
[13:33:07] <shoky> ?closest @ digs
[13:33:07] <sonotos> our normal projects are splitted in serveral hundrets of lib and module projects
[13:33:09] <bot-t> digs, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[13:33:23] <systemfault> sonotos: I see
[13:33:24] <shoky> yo tw2113
[13:33:41] <sonotos> in eclipse that's easy with the working sets
[13:39:24] <Krambiorix> afther appending a div with table and rows, is there a chance the DOM isn't ready instantly?
[13:41:36] <dabear> Krambiorix: dom will be ready
[13:42:18] <abletony84> ak: something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/abletony84/uycPf/3/
[13:42:22] <Norbo11> ive installed aptana sonotos
[13:42:27] <Norbo11> but not much has changed ?
[13:42:36] <Norbo11> maybe its conflicting with another plugin i installed
[13:42:45] <Norbo11> ive got webtools, php dev tools, and some other stuff
[13:42:53] <Krambiorix> dabear. I append a table and do $('#'+allids[j].sid).length  -> returns 0 but when i look for the value allids[j].sid in the dom (firebug) i can find it. What could cause this?
[13:44:20] <dabear> Krambiorix: either it doesn't exist (you might have used a class instead of id etc), or you have frames/iframes and are selecting the element from the wrong frame
[13:44:26] <dabear> or something else
[13:44:36] <dabear> 's wrong
[13:46:22] <ThrushAAX> ?paste
[13:46:23] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:46:39] <Krambiorix> dabear: class instead of id: no, frames/iframes: i added the table in the same frame (if there are) ...
[13:48:00] <dabear> Krambiorix: can't really tell what's wrong without a demo, see ?demo
[13:48:01] <bot-t> Krambiorix, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[14:05:56] <textchimp> hey, i have an object o that i'm basically using as an associative array, ie it's full of properties that are urls, and the value of each property is an other object, one of whose properties is a 'date' field. how would i best sort the items in this assoc array by the date field?
[14:06:19] <textchimp> o.sort(myfunc) doesn't work because it's not a normal array
[14:07:17] <LekeFly> Is it possible to mirror a select element? so that one <select> element mirrors to another? with exactly the same options..

[14:09:22] <digs> okay, last question, I have a class="foo bar" and I have var classname=$(this).attr('class'); Then I want to search for .bar or .foo .bar I don't care which. What is the easier way to do a .find() on classname?
[14:09:38] <dabear> Krambiorix: f you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\.
[14:10:18] <Krambiorix> dabear, 1000 times thanks mate!
[14:10:34] <dabear> digs: .find(".bar,.baz") ?

[15:15:17] <Ziggy`> digs: Could I see the html as well?
[15:17:23] <Ziggy`> digs: But as a starter I don't see why you use $(td) instead of just td
[15:18:09] <digs> Ziggy` - http://imagebin.org/224342 -- Don't rip on the html... it is built by the drupal forms api.
[15:18:16] <yakko> [facebook question] hey, what's the easiest way to put the posts of a FB PAGE into a website?

[15:19:43] <dregan> how to have a jquery slider show google ads(javascript code) instead of image slider?
[15:20:09] <Ziggy`> digs: Well, to me you're making a particularly easy task a complex one with your code.
[15:20:14] <digs> Ziggy` : http://imagebin.org/224343 -- The one that has the blank date is the one that removed.
[15:20:35] <digs> Ziggy`, I figured as much.
[15:22:51] <Ziggy`> digs: But it's relatively difficult for me to test this, as I only have an image and the code.
[15:22:59] <digs> Okay.
[15:23:03] <digs> I will make a fiddle.
[15:23:48] <dregan> guys can someone help me to get a google adsense ad working inside a jquery slider? pm me i will compensate for your time
[15:23:55] <Ziggy`> yakko: FB Javascript SDK ?
[15:24:16] <Ziggy`> dregan: PM me what you need.
[15:24:27] <Ziggy`> dregan: What slider and such.

[15:30:50] <digs> yakko - you use the feeds plugin.
[15:31:08] <yakko> digs: checking it
[15:31:13] <digs> you have to create a facebook application at developers.facebook.com first.
[15:31:29] <digs> Then you use the plugin code and put it in your site using the application id and secret.
[15:31:34] <yakko> digs: activity feed?
[15:33:53] <yakko> digs: doesn't really seem to do what I asked
[15:34:38] <digs> No, not the activity feed. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/
[15:34:56] * ksksal LISTEN :: radio URL: http://playbackfm.listen2myradio.com
[15:35:05] <digs> If you want profile posts, then you need need to pull them in.
[15:36:10] <digs> Ziggy` did you see my fiddle?
[15:37:00] <yakko> digs: how so? https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/activity/
[15:37:21] <digs> facebook doesn't want you to do what you are asking.
[15:37:38] <digs> They want you to develop an app that goes INTO facebook not pulling out of.
[15:37:54] <yakko> digs: now it makes sense
[15:37:59] <digs> So, if you want feeds, you will have to hook into the graph.
[15:38:13] <digs> And pull each one down... and then display it.
[15:38:31] <digs> if you want to post TO the feed from the site... they offer a way to do that.
[15:38:38] <yakko> digs: and how to let people like/comment ?
[15:38:46] <digs> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/channels/#feeddialog
[15:38:52] <yakko> no...
[15:38:56] <yakko> the website is mine
[15:38:58] <digs> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/
[15:39:04] <yakko> I create the posts, users comment on my posts
[15:39:04] <digs> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/
[15:39:23] <yakko> I create posts from facebook
[15:39:28] <digs> I know.
[15:39:32] <digs> you need to read more man.
[15:39:35] <yakko> just checking :)
[15:39:40] <digs> okay heh.
[15:40:11] <yakko> hate when I notice I made a bad question :)
[15:40:43] <Ziggy`> digs: Sorry, got a lot of work going on, couldn't manage to check it out, sorry.
[15:41:19] <digs> no worries.
[15:41:19] <yakko> I don't even want them to share what they write to their friends, I just really want them to write comments on the development blog of my website :)
[15:41:34] <digs> I _just_ figured it out... it was dumb... was using text and not val
[15:41:53] <digs> yakko, then use the comments plugin.
[15:42:13] <digs> example on the bottom of this site: http://truzul.com/
[15:42:38] <yakko> digs: can I hook the comments plugin to the post I wrote in my facebook page profile?
[15:42:54] <digs> It links automatically for everyone.
[15:43:21] <digs> Anytime you comment on a facebook plugin on any site in the world it publishes to your profile... based on your privacy settings.
[15:43:39] <yakko> comments plugin hooks to URLs, doesn't it? I'd like it to hook to a facebook_post_id
[15:43:54] <digs> doesn't work that way.
[15:44:02] <digs> The facebook api is horrible imho.
[15:44:34] <yakko> :(
[15:44:37] <yakko> I mean
[15:45:03] <yakko> all I want is to use FB page as my blog
[15:45:53] <yakko> since I'm already using a FB APP for login, why make a custom blog? or get a blogger from google? since I know all my users have facebook accounts :)
[15:49:02] <yakko> I could wrap it all up from my app with the API, but then, where's my time saver?
[15:52:49] <luchenbill> shoky you still around?
[15:58:43] <yakko> digs: thanks for the idea changing
[16:00:16] <yakko> digs: I think I'm going to copy and paste some fb css, pull profile posts and redirect them to the post page :P
[16:00:28] <yakko> facebook, lots of hate
[16:00:32] <yakko> by ;)
[16:00:33] <yakko> bye ;)
[16:05:12] <digs> this script is kicking my ass

[16:06:04] <davvblack> the slider A seems to get into a confused outlined active state when you try to drag
[16:07:16] <digs> works for me
[16:07:53] <davvblack> thanks, browser?
[16:08:11] <digs> chrome
[16:08:16] <digs> let me check version
[16:08:26] <digs> 21
[16:08:38] <davvblack> thanks much, i'll keep looking around.
[16:09:03] <davvblack> ugh, wtf, now it just randomly started working
[16:09:12] <davvblack> and now the old example that didn't work in-context works too
[16:09:18] <davvblack> make me look like a fool :-P
[16:09:40] <davvblack> must have been a cached version of the ui script
[16:14:07] <digs> davvblack heh :)
[16:16:12] <volk_> does anybody have any experience with the youtube API by any chance?
[16:17:44] <tw2113> some
[16:18:56] <volk_> tw2113: have you ever used the search part of the API? i'm trying to get results encoded in json, but sometimes i get malformed json thanks to the fact that some youtube users love to put quotes into video titles/ video descriptions so i can't properly parse the json
[16:19:38] <tw2113> nope, i've usually just read the user timeline
[16:21:02] <volk_> screw it . guess i'll just try to parse atom fed
[16:21:03] <volk_> feed
[16:22:32] <digs> is there a way to use wildcards in val() ?
[16:23:04] <tw2113> would you be offended if i laughed if you ran into the same issues with the atom feed volk_ ?
[16:23:07] <digs> Like if I want to select a value in a select box that starts with FOO but can end with any combination of numbers.
[16:23:26] <volk_> i would laugh myself, and then probably hang myself
[16:23:39] <tw2113> better option: find a way to get around it
[16:23:58] <tw2113> or process the data to fix before you try to use it
[16:27:27] <volk_> never mind tw2113, i foudn the bug. obviously it's not youtube's fault, the json is valid, it was something that i did to it right after it was returned that malformed the json
[16:28:12] <tw2113> yay!
[16:28:20] <tw2113> and now you don't have to fuck around with atom either
[16:28:23] <volk_> actually i have a new question now, the json that's returned has html special characters in it like "&quot;" , any ideas on getting rid of them?
[16:28:51] <volk_> thats why the json became malformed, i tried to get around it, but the way i did it, screwed it up
[16:28:56] <tw2113> you want to get rid of the visual quotes in your output?
[16:29:29] <volk_> right, i can't run jQuery.parseJSON( ) on something like {&quot;version&quot:&quot;
[16:29:48] <volk_> thats the output that's returned when i do console.log(myjson)
[16:29:55] <volk_> and it breaks the parsing function
[16:30:15] <tw2113> hmm

[16:48:56] <digs> How do I write this properly? $(this + ' option').each(function(){
[16:49:05] <digs> $(this) is a select box.

[17:26:36] <sporkf> How can I use css selector name="aa" on  <input type="checkbox" name="aa" data-val="aa" value="checkbox">
[17:27:32] <coldhead> $(':checkbox[name="aa"]')
[17:27:41] <coldhead> i think :checkbox is a thing
[17:27:44] <coldhead> ?:checkbox
[17:27:44] <bot-t> :checkbox: Selects all elements of type checkbox. http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[17:27:47] <sporkf> $('*//input[name="aa"]')  // what's the * mean ?
[17:27:56] <coldhead> bot-t: thank you
[17:27:56] * bot-t sighs
[17:28:01] <coldhead> sporkf: * matches any element
[17:28:07] <sporkf> ahh thanks
[17:32:32] <tab1293> can a client use chunked encoding when sending data to a http server, or can chuncked encoding only be used in a servers response to the client?
[17:35:32] <sporkf> TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'droppable'
[17:36:08] <sporkf> Why aren't my li and div tags droppable(),  they're draggable()?
[17:38:41] <coldhead> tab1293: chunked? do you mean compressed?
[17:39:07] <coldhead> sporkf: i /think/ the droppable is the element into which draggable things may be dropped
[17:39:07] <tab1293> no coldhead i mean chuncked
[17:39:18] <coldhead> i am not with you then tab1293, i am sorry
[17:39:31] <tab1293> no problem
[17:44:38] <sporkf> Is there a way to script or "animate" the dragging?
[17:47:43] <sporkf> I just want to test a widget.
[17:50:45] <Raydiation> i got a div which i bound a scroll event to. when i empty the diff and load new html into it doesnt work any more

[17:52:13] <Raydiation> k fixed it by not loading the div^^

[18:52:42] <coldhead> welcome
[19:05:00] <digs> thanks shoky re: 2hrs ago
[19:07:46] <digs> Why must everything be a can of worms.
[19:12:06] <phonebook_> i hate being here as much as you all hate having me here but this is the quickest place to hopefully find an answer
[19:12:45] <phonebook_> i just tried wrapping <html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html> and it didnt work
[19:13:01] <RandalSchwartz> "wrapping"?
[19:13:07] <RandalSchwartz> you want something *outside* that?
[19:13:11] <phonebook_> is jquery incapable of wrapping when the outer tag is <html>
[19:13:19] <RandalSchwartz> it won't make illegal syntax
[19:13:24] <phonebook_> i want that to become a jquery object
[19:13:26] <RandalSchwartz> well, it can, but you have to try hard
[19:13:33] <phonebook_> ?
[19:13:44] <RandalSchwartz> $('html')
[19:13:48] <RandalSchwartz> is that what you wante?
[19:13:58] <phonebook_> no i want this...
[19:14:12] <phonebook_> $(<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>);
[19:14:22] <phonebook_> doent work
[19:14:29] <RandalSchwartz> even with the quotes?
[19:14:33] <RandalSchwartz> since that's not legal like that
[19:14:35] <phonebook_> right, quotes not there was a typo
[19:14:44] <azbyin> is there a way to disable the window scrollbar? i mean disable as in 'not clickable' instead of html, body {overflow:hidden;}
[19:15:16] <phonebook_> $("<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>")
[19:15:35] <coldhead> i don't think you can do that with an entire html page, only fragments
[19:15:51] <phonebook_> thats fine with me, i already found an answer, was just wondering why
[19:15:52] <RandalSchwartz> ahh, that reduced to <div></div> for me
[19:16:01] <phonebook_> right
[19:16:19] <RandalSchwartz> "I already found an answer" which is?
[19:16:21] <coldhead> prevents two headed HTML monster
[19:16:23] <coldhead> s
[19:16:38] <phonebook_> i just regexed out the div i want from the raw text
[19:16:44] <coldhead> ?cc
[19:16:45] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:17:00] <RandalSchwartz> regex is generally a loss
[19:17:14] <RandalSchwartz> you could have wrapped it then asked for the div
[19:17:28] <phonebook_> actually
[19:17:45] <phonebook_> nm, found an even better answer than regex
[19:17:46] <phonebook_> anyway
[19:17:48] <phonebook_> okay, thx
[19:17:55] <RandalSchwartz> what better answer?
[19:17:58] <RandalSchwartz> please stop being selfish
[19:18:03] <phonebook_> basically i didnt understand the problem
[19:18:34] <phonebook_> was trying $(<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>).find("div") and looking for attributes there thinking it would be the outermost div
[19:18:45] <phonebook_> but since $(<html><head></head><body><div></div></body></html>); is the outermost div thats all i need in this case
[19:18:57] <coldhead> good job! well explained
[19:19:05] <phonebook_> hushaw
[19:19:25] <ajpiano> phonebook_: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7784 http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-misc-plugins/#htmldoc
[19:20:17] <coldhead> oh ben, always with the plugins
[19:21:09] * RandalSchwartz wanders offf
[19:21:13] <rainabba> Suddenly jquery-ui-1.8.12.custom.min.js is throwing 'jquery' is undefined. I have not modified the file and the file itself is included just fine (IE debugger actually opens the file and highlights the offending line). The only thing that seems likely is that I haven't included the actual jQuery library but I'm 99% sure that can't be (asp.net app using Telerik controls and most of the site is
[19:21:14] <rainabba> working fine which means that jquery is loaded). What else could cause this?
[19:21:55] <rainabba> Though "alert($);" does return undefined.
[19:22:25] <coldhead> i'm going to bet on your 1% that it's not being loaded
[19:22:33] <rainabba> .. AND my dropdown in debugger shows my jQuery file is included.
[19:22:54] <coldhead> what does alert(jQuery); yield?
[19:22:58] <rainabba> Heh, now that I look at the file though.... :)
[19:23:08] <coldhead> you are the 1%
[19:23:11] <rainabba> Thanks for the help ;P
[19:23:46] <rainabba> I'm going to start joining empty channels and pretending that you're there coldhead. If I still can't figure it out, then I'll come here and ask.
[19:24:13] <coldhead> join #coldhead
[19:24:19] <coldhead> for the authentic feeling
[19:24:26] <coldhead> although that channel is full of jerks
[19:24:30] <coldhead> i'm banned
[19:24:35] <coldhead> but you might get along
[19:24:44] <rainabba> Oh now, don't be that way.
[19:24:49] <azbyin> lol, you're banned there? why?
[19:24:58] <azbyin> i'll unban you from there if you join
[19:25:00] <coldhead> i don't know, man, i didn't do it
[19:25:01] <rainabba> He gives them an inferiority complex.
[19:25:09] <azbyin> oh wait, i can;t do that :p
[19:25:18] <coldhead> i can't join there again anyway
[19:25:21] <coldhead> it's the past now
[19:25:26] <coldhead> i've moved on
[19:25:29] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[19:27:59] <coldhead> bye, Davey
[19:28:15] <rmurphey> you're so sentimental tonight, coldhead
[19:28:49] <rainabba> coldhead: I've got a server mod in #coldhead now if you want to join and ensure you're not banned.
[19:30:27] <rainabba> coldhead: nm, you're good. The banlist is empty.
[19:33:23] <tw2113> accidentally closed this room
[19:33:31] <digs> sure sure.
[19:34:52] <coldhead> thanks rainabba
[19:35:36] <rainabba> np
[20:11:47] <ezakimak> which is the more expected UI pattern: a) user edits a record, and the changes are immediately persistent, or b) user edits a record, but must explicitely click "save" to make it persist?
[20:13:55] <coldhead> probably depends which year the user was born
[20:14:02] <beancurd> by persistent, do you mean the edit is commited? or just saved temporarily.
[20:14:08] <coldhead> the "save" method is pretty deeply ingrained
[20:15:05] <beancurd> i'd expect to have to click 'save' to commit the change, but it'd be nice if the form remembers my progress lest i accidentally close the form, or browser crashes.
[20:59:58] <yen_> Hey guys, is the post-pagination in this page correctly usin jquery/ajax? http://goo.gl/mktDw
[21:22:04] <yen_> Hey guys, is the post pagination in this page correctly using jquery/ajax? http://goo.gl/mktDw
[21:23:54] <systemfault> post pagination?
[21:24:12] <yen_> yeah the pagination at the bottom of the post content. Page 1 2
[21:24:14] <yen_> do u see it?
[21:24:23] <systemfault> It doesn't work at all.. I get full refreshes
[21:24:34] <yen_> i know!
[21:24:41] <yen_> weird im wondering what i have done wrong.
[21:24:46] <systemfault> Why is the layout so messed up? :(
[21:25:00] <systemfault> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'flexslider'
[21:25:01] <yen_> this is a test site. so pls disregard everything else
[21:25:10] <yen_> :-)
[21:25:47] <yen_> i basically used this script: http://www.designaeon.com/wordpress-ajax-pagination/
[21:26:14] <yen_> and then add some specifications. so i think it may be a sematic issue?
[21:31:05] <yen_> systemfault you with me?
[21:58:21] <libin> hello : I am having a trouble in retieveing a json value from a php file. I can see the json vale showing in the page.. but it also shows an error invalid sysntax http://efernssolutions.com/Test/json_t.html
[21:58:36] <libin> any clue about why that is happening?
[21:58:58] <ENQ> bad json format?
[21:59:07] <ENQ> you are doind json_encode() arent you?
[21:59:33] <libin> {"sample":"4"} .. this is wat i get in console though
[21:59:39] <ENQ> oh
[22:00:30] <libin> yes..  i am using json_encode ()
[22:00:58] <libin> am i not allowed to use json_encode?
[22:01:01] <ENQ> is it response?
[22:01:09] <ENQ> no you should use it
[22:01:32] <devslash> I'm trying to set the background image of a div like this $('.jp-mute').css('background',url('images/muteunmute.png')); but thats obviously wrong because it causes my other jplayer elements to appear incorrectly. does anyone know what I am doing wrong ?
[22:01:34] <libin> yes
[22:01:38] <libin> its the reponose
[22:01:47] <devslash> if i comment this line the other elements render correctly
[22:02:21] <yen_> hey enq is the pagination in this post correctly using jquery/ajax? http://goo.gl/mktDw
[22:02:49] <ENQ> libin, you might try to use jquery ajax request? which is much simplier
[22:03:40] <ENQ> idk yen_ it workss for me tho :)
[22:03:56] <yen_> what works for you??
[22:04:09] <libin> does that mean I also need to use getJson as well , instead of loadJson
[22:04:09] <ENQ> pages
[22:04:41] <devslash> anyone know if the format is wrong
[22:04:45] <ENQ> libin, you can try to use just$('element_to_put_data'). load(url)
[22:04:59] <yen_> sorry, a little confused. are you saying that link i sent the ajax pagination is working okay? enq
[22:05:19] <yen_> cause it's def not for me :-s enq
[22:05:32] <ENQ> yen_, i dont think ajax is, becouse all page is reloaded :)
[22:05:50] <yen_> yeah exactly, u are correct:  i basically used this script: http://www.designaeon.com/wordpress-ajax-pagination/
[22:06:25] <yen_> and then tried to add in some customization (for class, position and css). maybe there is some sematic error. am i missing something? :-s
[22:07:13] <ENQ> yen_, doesnt show any errors, might paste the code?
[22:07:24] <yen_> sure.
[22:07:35] <ENQ> devslash, sjouldnt url be in quetes?
[22:07:42] <ENQ> shouldnt
[22:07:50] <devslash> i tried it without quotes
[22:08:23] <ENQ> $('.jp-mute').css('background', 'url("images/muteunmute.png")');
[22:08:26] <ENQ> maybe?
[22:08:28] <yen_> here u go enq: http://pastebin.com/j9BaEBFf
[22:08:29] <devslash> $('.jp-mute').css('background-image',url(images/muteunmute.png));
[22:08:47] <devslash> i tried that too
[22:09:57] <devslash> when i put that into firebug in google chrome it says url is not defined
[22:10:49] <ENQ> yen_, ahve you tryed to specify what script is in your <script> tag? like <script type="text/javascript">
[22:10:59] <tw2113> well, inspect element in chrome isn't relative to your stylesheet
[22:11:03] <tw2113> devslash,
[22:11:49] <devslash> yes
[22:12:04] <yen_> enq let me try that
[22:12:22] <Aenigma> hi, i'm new to jquery/js. i'm tryint to control bootstrap's carousel using a set of images in a class which triggers a click event. the elements in the carousel are enumerated (0..3). how do i enumerate the tags to correspond? I'm going off the example provided in http://api.jquery.com/click/ as of now
[22:13:05] <Aenigma> bootstrap has something like $('carousel').carousel(2) to actually switch to the given slide
[22:14:00] <ENQ> Aenigma, what are you trying to do?
[22:14:25] <Aenigma> ENQ: i'm trying to make buttons control the carousel in bootstrap
[22:15:07] <ENQ> then do it with click :) $("#button1").click(function(){ $('carousel').carousel(1) });
[22:15:37] <yen_> like this : http://pastebin.com/qRnBA0C enq
[22:16:13] <ENQ> yen_, cant see paste
[22:16:19] <Aenigma> ENQ: so no way to make it more automated? i have to make different IDs for each button?
[22:16:34] <ENQ> no Aenigma you can :)
[22:16:57] <ENQ> you can add some data-imageID = 1 and so to button attributes
[22:17:12] <ENQ> i would, its clean and easy :)
[22:17:20] <yen_> enq : now http://pastebin.com/2yQAwkEA
[22:17:59] <yen_> it's still fully loading however... let me know if i missed something.
[22:18:01] <ENQ> and do like $(".swCarousel").click(function(){ $('carousel').carousel($(this).data("imageID")) });
[22:18:40] <stupac> What does /text/ mean?
[22:18:51] <ENQ> yen_, now i see some errors in firebug :)
[22:19:03] <Aenigma> ENQ: ahhh. cool
[22:19:06] <ENQ>  jQuery('' .post-pagination') ) is wrong
[22:19:13] <ENQ> no need '' in fornt?
[22:20:09] <ENQ> and yen_ some of your assets link is broken

[22:29:25] <zapsoda> hi
[22:29:27] <zapsoda> can somone help me? http://ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout/  i am trying to set up http://manos.malihu.gr/jquery-custom-content-scroller on the #main div and i feel like i did everything they said but its not working :(
[22:33:27] <ENQ> zapsoda, is jquery included in your project?
[22:33:39] <zapsoda> Yes right before </body>
[22:33:44] <zapsoda> should i put it in the head?
[22:33:46] <ENQ> and is it first script?
[22:34:02] <ENQ> it should be before all your plugins
[22:34:31] <ENQ> probably should be first js include
[22:36:00] <zapsoda> ok
[22:36:07] <zapsoda> i put it at the top of the head
[22:36:14] <zapsoda> its first line or second line
[22:37:43] <zapsoda> got it
[22:37:54] <zapsoda> ty ENQ for your help
[22:38:08] <ENQ> yw
[22:38:20] <coldhead> good job everyone, take five
[23:05:02] <rainabba> coldhead: it worked, pretended I was asking you a question and resolved it first ;) Good job man! (dorky high five attempt)
[23:19:01] <zapsoda> ok next and hopfully last question: does anyone know of a script that could set the main div to be x% height of the browser window size? on ashermccauley.com/FluidLayout
[23:28:30] <MadTBone> I have a jquery variable asigned something like this:  myArray = $('.someclass').children('li');     I want to do something like   $(myArray[index]).children('div.class_two > div.class_three > img');   Is that posible without resorting to multiple calls to find() or children()?
[23:31:23] <zapsoda> anyone?
[23:32:02] <ENQ> donno zapsoda , can't you do it yourslef?
[23:32:41] <zapsoda> no i know very very little Jquery or JS
[23:36:09] <flam_> why can't you _learn to do it_ yourself?
[23:36:29] <ENQ> zapsoda, $("#mainDiv").css("height", $(window).height()*0,9);
[23:39:04] <zapsoda> i think i can but not right now and im hoping to finish this site 2night
[23:40:00] <yen_> flam_ any idea what's wrong with this ajax pagination in the post. it does not seem to be working. enq is trying to help but i wanted to ask u as well http://goo.gl/ol2RT
[23:41:51] <zapsoda> ty ENQ i assume the css takes 2 things a property and a value? so that selects the main div and sets the height to window.height times .9?
[23:42:38] <ENQ> yes
[23:42:40] <ENQ> 90% :D
[23:43:01] <zapsoda> So then i just have to find out how to make a event handler for when window is resized and when its loaded? and have them trigger this in a function?
[23:43:13] <zapsoda> Cool thank you very much ENQ
[23:43:15] <ENQ> yes
[23:45:17] <yen_> enq is so helpful!
[23:45:55] <Bauer> guys, we are using jquery 1.7, and .prop method stopped working :( it now says no such method
[23:46:16] <Bauer> how can this be? even in console in firebug we see no prop in autocomplete for p*
[23:47:38] <coldhead> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/TstLJ/
[23:47:48] <coldhead> prop is defined in 1.7.2 on that page
[23:47:58] <goddard> can some one help me translate my script to jquery
[23:47:59] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/yxRd6/
[23:48:21] <goddard> its not working in javascript any way at least multiple calls to the same function aren't acting as expected
[23:49:04] <Bauer> coldhead: we are using 1.7.1: https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.js
[23:49:08] <coldhead> that's a big job, goddard
[23:49:25] <goddard> coldhead: it is?
[23:49:35] <coldhead> i suggest you start by replacing your calls to getElementById('foo') with $('#foo')
[23:49:40] <mazzachre> Does anyone here use hoverIntent? I seem to have a slight problem with it... Or perhaps I have just not configured it rightly? If I have to elements next to eachother and swirve the mouse between them after the first one have triggered, the second one will trigger instantly and then the first one will not trigger again until I have moved the mouse well away and waited for some time...
[23:49:48] <coldhead> it's a big job to ask someone else to do for you, goddard :)
[23:49:57] <coldhead> then read up on ajax() and have a go at using that
[23:50:03] <coldhead> ?ajax
[23:50:04] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[23:50:07] <goddard> coldhead: well im honestly just trying to figure out why multiple calls to the same function dont work
[23:50:30] <goddard> coldhead: if I remove one call it loads properly
[23:50:43] <goddard> coldhead: if I leave both the php response is dead on and perfect
[23:51:33] <coldhead> Bauer: http://jsfiddle.net/NntT9/ that's working with the jQuery you linked
[23:51:52] <coldhead> Bauer: try alert($.fn.jquery) at the console
[23:52:02] <coldhead> see if something is loading an earlier version of jQuery
[23:52:09] <coldhead> which would clobber your newer version
[23:52:32] <coldhead> goddard: probably because AJAX is asynchronous and runs in the background?
[23:52:43] <coldhead> it doesn't return immediately
[23:53:10] <tehcyx> i got something like this: function test() { some stuff to do + ajax.done( function() { callFunction(); }) } . how can i call callFunction in .done() it tells me ReferenceError
[23:53:12] <coldhead> or rather, it DOES return immediately but the results of your success handler won't happen until the data is actually received from the server
[23:53:13] <goddard> coldhead: it loads both in this instance without relying on the other call
[23:53:37] <goddard> is that what you mean?
[23:54:19] <coldhead> possibly
[23:54:22] <coldhead> i'm just guessing
[23:54:26] <coldhead> you have a lot of functions here
[23:54:33] <coldhead> and it's not clear which is failing
[23:54:47] <coldhead> i'd take it to #javascript if you don't feel like rewriting it in jQuery
[23:55:34] <coldhead> depends where and how callFunction is defined, tehcyx
[23:55:39] <coldhead> need to see your codes
[23:56:22] <coldhead> bot-t: tell goddard I will never forget you
[23:56:23] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[23:56:27] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
