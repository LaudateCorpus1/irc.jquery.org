[04:44:05] <Aljone> hey guys how do i findmemory leaking in my app, it seems afer a while my crhome show msg that out of memory
[05:36:48] <RandomNoob> Hello guys. I have https://jsfiddle.net/s0r2xcL1/ . It works while page loads. But when it finishes load cant catch the click event.
[05:41:22] <Sandlayth> try put your function outside of your $(document).ready?
[05:52:39] <sonu_nk> on  https://babeljs.io/repl/ i was trying to minify my script and also i can see there are preset like es2015, es2016, ..., react, stage-0... etc... which i should i select ?
[05:54:10] <FilipNortic> RandomNoob: are you replacing the element you bind it on with ajax or something like that
[05:55:01] <FilipNortic> cause the listener will be bound to the domelement not to an element you introdunce later
[05:56:58] <Cork> RandomNoob: yupwhat FilipNortic is most likely the cause and this should help https://jsfiddle.net/s0r2xcL1/1/
[05:57:50] <Cork> uh... *yup, what FilipNortic said is*
[05:58:26] <FilipNortic> and more realistic fiddles will give better/faster and more answers instead of vague guesses
[05:58:43] <FilipNortic> and more realistic fiddles will give better/faster answers of vague guesses
[05:58:53] <FilipNortic> i give up
[05:59:16] <FilipNortic> and more realistic fiddles will give better/faster answers instead of vague guesses
[06:02:44] <FilipNortic> is parent up or down in the dom tree I would say up but everone doen't agree with me it seems
[06:04:21] <RandomNoob> FilipNortic: You are right I fixed it. Added callback into .load()
[06:05:14] <FilipNortic> RandomNoob: ok, but  Corks way i better
[06:05:56] <FilipNortic> RandomNoob: ok, but Corks way is likley better*
[06:06:23] <RandomNoob>  FilipNortic: Cork: Thanks guys.
[06:09:12] <FilipNortic> yw
[08:43:31] <Justice> Hi im using jquery sortable but getting really flickery experiance when trying to move to top 2 items in div
[08:43:59] <Justice> tried with adding padding top/bottom but cannot figure out how to get it working correctly
[10:13:03] <lng> Hi! How do I match certain option from a set? <select id="foo"><option value="12">12</option><option value="N">N</option></select>. $('#foo > [option=12]') <-- it doesn't work
[10:13:31] <Woet> lng: what did you google for so far?
[10:14:00] <lng> Woet: a forecast
[10:14:12] <Woet> lng: thats not gonna help with this question
[10:14:36] <lng> do I need to use .find()?
[10:14:57] <Woet> lng: what did you google for so far?
[10:15:33] <decx> it's [attr=value]
[10:15:46] <decx> option is an element not an attribute
[10:16:40] <lng> ah
[10:16:43] <lng> right
[10:17:51] <Woet> which all of the google results would have shown you
[10:19:03] <lng> decx: thanks! I got it
[10:22:24] <Woet> lng: no problem
[10:23:09] <lng> Woet: are you bot?
[10:23:16] <Woet> lng: doubtful
[10:23:23] <lng> I see
[10:24:32] <Uhkis> i can confirm Woet is not a bot
[10:24:54] <Woet> just trying to teach people how to look up information themselves instead of relying on others
[10:30:37] <AdamPDotty> I am relying on you to teach that.
[11:15:34] <meybe> what is the use of jQuery
[11:16:51] <taplar_> to smooth out differences between different browsers and same browsers of different versions
[11:37:55] <Es0teric> alright so i have this: https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/13/ and though the count goes up on click, when its clicked again it keeps going up and not decreasing
[11:38:02] <Es0teric> its only supposed to be a +1/-1 situation
[11:40:30] <taplar_> this is related to the question you asked yesterday
[11:40:46] <taplar_> clicked is scoped to the handler.  it is created anew each time
[11:41:22] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah its related to the question from yesterday
[11:41:50] <Es0teric> taplar_ so then how do i save the state of it being previously clicked?
[11:42:09] <Es0teric> if clicked = true; is never changing
[11:42:22] <Es0teric> even if i do have a clicked = false; after the if
[11:42:35] <taplar_> you have to preserve contextual state some how
[11:42:45] <Es0teric> taplar_ how?
[11:43:16] <taplar_> various ways are available.  do you have any thoughts about it?
[11:43:27] <Es0teric> taplar_ a cookie?
[11:43:41] <Es0teric> but i dont want to store it in the cookie.. i think thats not even necessary.. there can be a different way
[11:43:58] <taplar_> so don't use a cookie
[11:44:11] <taplar_> how else can data be associated with dom elements?
[11:44:22] <taplar_> or state created?
[11:44:24] <Es0teric> on click i can add a .data()
[11:44:32] <taplar_> go for it
[11:44:39] <Es0teric> like "+" or "-"
[11:44:48] <taplar_> or true/false
[11:44:52] <Es0teric> ohhhhh
[11:45:01] <Es0teric> true/false on the .data
[11:45:02] <taplar_> or "yes"/"no"
[11:45:02] <Es0teric> right?
[11:45:06] <taplar_> lots of options, :)
[11:45:21] <Es0teric> so then i can add a data-clicked-emoji=true
[11:45:29] <Es0teric> and compare against that
[11:45:43] <taplar_> data("clicked", true)
[11:47:36] <Es0teric> taplar_ so then i set that to true by default
[11:48:04] <taplar_> i'd assume you'd set it to true if it is not true
[11:48:17] <taplar_> and set it to false if it is true
[11:48:22] <taplar_> as part of the if else logic
[11:50:52] <Es0teric> taplar_ so then if its undefined or false then set it to true
[11:51:02] <taplar_> != true
[11:51:16] <taplar_> which would be true for undefined or false
[11:52:57] <Es0teric> taplar_ i dont get it https://jsfiddle.net/0gx1roq7/14/
[11:53:49] <taplar_> why are you doing $.data?
[11:54:37] <Es0teric> taplar_ because thats how i saw the usage
[11:54:44] <Es0teric> i know i can do $(this).data('clicked', true);
[11:55:04] <taplar_> apparently you can do it either way, according to the docs.  i usually just use $element.data(key, value)
[11:55:15] <taplar_> so ok, what's wrong now?
[11:55:40] <taplar_> ah, ic
[11:56:12] <taplar_> you're flippling the clicked on the element, not the variable
[11:56:23] <taplar_> you need to do both
[11:56:39] <Es0teric> i am going to have to see what you mean taplar_
[11:56:39] <taplar_> or simply do away with that variable and just test against the element
[11:57:02] <taplar_> lets say the element has not been clicked before
[11:57:05] <taplar_> what does that logic do?
[11:57:26] <Es0teric> sets clicked to true
[11:57:29] <Es0teric> all the time
[11:57:33] <Es0teric> via the data attr
[11:57:34] <taplar_> step by step
[11:57:39] <taplar_> what is clicked on ln 5?
[11:57:49] <Es0teric> undefined
[11:57:57] <taplar_> what does ln 7 evaluate as?
[11:58:05] <Es0teric> false
[11:58:08] <Es0teric> undefined/false
[11:58:09] <taplar_> ?
[11:58:18] <taplar_> undefined != true -> true
[11:58:37] <Es0teric> i dont get that
[11:58:40] <taplar_> why?
[11:58:42] <Es0teric> its not false
[11:58:47] <Es0teric> so why would it evaluate as true
[11:58:53] <Es0teric> OHHH
[11:58:57] <taplar_> you are not checking false
[11:59:04] <Es0teric> yes i just realized that
[11:59:26] <taplar_> so what happens?
[11:59:45] <Es0teric> the data attr gets set on $(this) to clicked = true
[12:00:15] <taplar_> alright, so as of line 13, what are the values of the variable clicked and the data element clicked?
[12:00:47] <tuudik> Hi! Question regarding: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:00:55] <tuudik> I want to post specific function
[12:01:07] <tuudik> i found few article from stack overflow
[12:01:11] <Es0teric> taplar_ its undefined
[12:01:14] <tuudik> they recommend to use action attribute
[12:01:25] <tuudik> but in the documentation, i don't see action attribute
[12:01:30] <taplar_> huh?  there is no 'it'.  i asked about two different variables
[12:01:40] <tuudik> what's the correct way to post to specific function to one php file?
[12:01:45] <Es0teric> taplar_ clicked  = undefined now
[12:01:56] <taplar_> it was set on line 5
[12:02:01] <taplar_> what removed it?
[12:02:09] <taplar_> oh wait, right
[12:02:11] <taplar_> yes
[12:02:21] <taplar_> so what about the element clicked value?
[12:02:27] <Es0teric> its not there
[12:02:37] <taplar_> tuudik: url specified the place ajax should hit
[12:02:37] <Es0teric> so it was never set
[12:02:46] <taplar_> method specifies GET/POST
[12:03:02] <taplar_> Es0teric: right, so what about the data element clicked as of line 13?
[12:03:23] <Es0teric> taplar_ its neither false or true so that block will not execute
[12:03:52] <taplar_> so clicked == undefined and the data clicked is true, yes?
[12:04:04] <Es0teric> yeah
[12:04:08] <Es0teric> so thats what i should check for
[12:04:12] <taplar_> as of line 13, shouldn't they be the same?
[12:04:47] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah
[12:06:24] <Es0teric> taplar_ i still dont get it though
[12:06:43] <taplar_> you're not done yet, work though this part first, ;)
[12:06:52] <taplar_> small steps
[12:10:37] <taplar_> fixing to get food so brb.  but once you get the first time clicked logic down, then assume that they have clicked it before and start working through the logic the exact same way, step by step, and see if the variables will be what they should be for that case
[12:23:18] <mkr2> can someone please help me solve this --> https://jsfiddle.net/qp6qqd9L/
[12:25:35] <taplar_lunch> your if syntax is invalid for one thing
[12:30:08] <mkr2> taplar_lunch --> https://jsfiddle.net/qp6qqd9L/1/
[12:43:14] <Zzaichik> mkr2: also, innerHeight is looking at pixels
[12:43:20] <Uhkis> mkr2: something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/qp6qqd9L/4/
[12:44:40] <mkr2> Uhkis: it seems not to do anything
[12:45:14] <Uhkis> mkr2: does if you modify the text
[12:46:22] <mkr2> Uhkis: oh yeah it does, nice. but the button never show if its more text
[12:50:39] <Zzaichik> mkr2: well, you'd have to set up an event to watch the button for a click. Right now, all you're doing is showing/hiding the button
[12:51:21] <mkr2> Zzaichik I change to -- > on('keydown')
[12:51:31] <mkr2> so when I pressed down a key it will check
[12:52:12] <mkr2> but something is wrong.. button will not come back -- > https://jsfiddle.net/qp6qqd9L/5/
[12:52:55] <taplar_lunch> look at your console
[12:53:28] <Zzaichik> click event should be watching button
[12:54:04] <mkr2> if I type so I have two rows the button should hide, otherwise it should show
[12:54:39] <taplar_lunch> so why are you checking innerHeight?
[12:55:05] <Uhkis> mkr2: you have to resize the textarea small enough first
[12:55:39] <Zzaichik> mkr2:  there are a few issues here. First, innerHeight() watches pixel height. And, you're setting the height to 200px.
[12:56:09] <Zzaichik> It may help to watch character count instead of height
[12:56:29] <mkr2> ok, its maybe easier to do lenght?
[12:56:34] <taplar_lunch> if the condition is based on rows, height is not a factor
[12:56:49] <taplar_lunch> rows are determined by the number of
[12:56:52] <taplar_lunch> \n in them
[12:56:58] <taplar_lunch> at minimum
[12:57:32] <mkr2> taplar_lunch : yes its rows I wanna check, so if text has two rows then do this
[12:57:33] <taplar_lunch> if you are trying to consider wordwrapped text as a 'row', :s
[12:58:00] <taplar_lunch> so take the value, split it by \n, and count
[12:58:05] <Zzaichik> I'd probably use .val().length
[12:58:14] <Zzaichik> or yeah - split by \n
[12:58:20] <Zzaichik> more code, but will work
[12:59:41] <mkr2> Zzaichik : ok, thats true, hmm.. yeah.. but if I do lenght it will not be nice when it comes to mobile view
[13:00:10] <mkr2> cause the textarea windows is much smaller than, so it should be better with checking the rows
[13:00:22] <mkr2> then*
[13:00:57] <Zzaichik> If you're trying to handle for mobile as well, yes counting the new lines is probably best.
[13:01:53] <Zzaichik> Will keydown even work then?
[13:02:00] <taplar_lunch> input or keyup
[13:02:21] <taplar_lunch> keydown would not have applied the key change to the value yet
[13:02:36] <taplar_lunch> if at all, in the case of a non text key
[13:04:54] <Zzaichik> no more lunch?! I'm sorry to hear that
[13:05:04] <taplar_> it was decent enough, :)
[13:05:16] <Zzaichik> that's good at least.
[13:07:03] <taplar_> brb
[13:10:09] <mkr2> will try and see what I get =)
[13:11:30] <jquery080> can i get some help with jquery validation please?
[13:12:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery080 if you have a question, just ask - if somebody can help, they will :)
[13:12:46] <jquery080> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/c067gnm9/   this is a section from my site which needs to be done this way but getting some console errors and valid isnt working correctly
[13:12:54] <jquery080> rules dont seem to apply
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> lol no need to ping me ;)
[13:13:12] <jquery080> oki lol
[13:13:12] <Uhkis> pretty big Promise() there
[13:13:43] <taplar_> afaik, that's not how the validate works
[13:13:52] <taplar_> you need to put the rules on the elements that you initialize validate on
[13:14:23] <taplar_> and those input fields need names
[13:14:31] <jquery080> umm i used .add rules
[13:14:34] <z1haze_> can jquery take an array of selectors?
[13:14:45] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ what do the docs say?
[13:14:52] <taplar_> the validate plugin is driven off of names
[13:14:59] <z1haze_> i have an array of strings that I need to fetch elements by their id
[13:15:04] <taplar_> as well as basic form submission
[13:15:06] <jquery080> taplar_: i did see you can do it off class too
[13:15:26] <jquery080> i get this error in console  a.validator.methods[d] is undefined
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ https://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:15:54] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to look yourself :)
[13:16:26] <z1haze_> i dont see?
[13:16:40] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ does it tell you that it'll take an array?
[13:16:48] <z1haze_> i see 'An array containing a set of DOM elements to wrap in a jQuery object.' but theres no example
[13:16:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not an array of selectors.
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> does it say anywhere that it'll take an array of selectors?
[13:17:26] <z1haze_> no
[13:17:33] <robertmaxrees> so then there's your answer :)
[13:17:37] <z1haze_> :(
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to work around.
[13:17:49] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/c067gnm9/1/
[13:17:52] <z1haze_> im stumped
[13:18:10] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ so it's like ['#id1, #id2'] etc?
[13:18:20] <z1haze_> it can be, yes
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> err ['#id1', '#id2']
[13:18:23] <robertmaxrees> "can be"?
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> can you clarify?
[13:18:48] <z1haze_> sure, ill try to briefly
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> you said you just have an array of selectors, right?
[13:19:08] <robertmaxrees> bnecause the easy option is to use .join()
[13:19:18] <z1haze_> I have an object returned from the server containing error messages for form fields, like customerEmail, billingFirstName, billingLastName, paymentMethod, etc
[13:19:32] <z1haze_> the first word of the error key states what section the error belongs to on the page
[13:19:40] <z1haze_> i need to scroll to the top most section that contains errors
[13:19:45] <robertmaxrees> $(theArray.join(','));
[13:20:11] <z1haze_> well first i have the turn my keys into an array that makes esnse for the sections
[13:20:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:20:51] <z1haze_> because billingFistName doesnt help
[13:20:55] <z1haze_> i just need 'billing' why is that funny
[13:21:26] <z1haze_> i have code that works i just want a refactor thats better
[13:21:30] <robertmaxrees> because your question just changed a bunch.  you went from "how can i pass an array of selectors?" to "well i have this compelx object and i need to transform it into something else."
[13:21:52] <z1haze_> robertmaxrees, http://dpaste.com/3V21DD1
[13:22:01] <z1haze_> this works i just want it better
[13:22:06] <z1haze_> seems like a lot of work for something so simple
[13:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you have your array of selectrors, yeah?
[13:22:15] <taplar_> personally i'd modify that key to at minimum billing.FirstName or if possible make the response return an object with billing as the key with a value of an object with the related information
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:23:21] <z1haze_> the code shared does what is intended, i just think its messy
[13:23:25] <z1haze_> do you agree?
[13:23:47] <taplar_> having never seen the code..........
[13:24:06] <z1haze_> z1haze_> robertmaxrees, http://dpaste.com/3V21DD1
[13:24:24] <robertmaxrees> dude i'm looking now.
[13:24:25] <robertmaxrees> slow down ;)
[13:24:26] <taplar_> yeah, i'd put a dot in there
[13:24:43] <z1haze_> i was showing taplar as he said he dint see it
[13:24:45] <jquery080> taplar_: it needs to be done with class...this is my problem
[13:24:45] <robertmaxrees> also: inconsistent formatting for if statements >.>
[13:24:46] <jquery080> https://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addClassRules/
[13:24:58] <z1haze_> yea i see robertmaxrees
[13:25:13] <z1haze_> actually fixed that on my end
[13:25:20] <jquery080> https://jsfiddle.net/c067gnm9/2/      on trigger i  get this error  a.validator.methods[d] is undefined
[13:25:36] <z1haze_> im not sure how id modify that key, and how that would help
[13:25:45] <z1haze_> i am not able to change the server response
[13:26:06] <taplar_> splitting by '.' is much easier
[13:26:45] <z1haze_> k.split(/(?=[A-Z])/)[0] is working for the split
[13:27:21] <robertmaxrees> "the code shared does what is intended, i just think its messy" " k.split(/(?=[A-Z])/)[0] is working for the split"
[13:27:26] <taplar_> so you are asking for opinions, but then ignoring them?
[13:27:27] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want feedback orrrr?
[13:27:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:27:55] <z1haze_> more concerned with thelength of the code
[13:28:04] <taplar_> lenth !== clarity
[13:28:07] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^
[13:28:09] <taplar_> *lengt
[13:28:11] <taplar_> fk
[13:28:12] <z1haze_> and as i said i cannot change the response from the server
[13:28:15] <z1haze_> the key is what the key is.
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:28:32] <taplar_> so, *thumbs up*.  go you man
[13:28:37] <z1haze_> wtf
[13:28:40] <robertmaxrees> also: elY and y are bad var names
[13:28:50] <robertmaxrees> you asked for feedback and then ignored what we gave you.
[13:28:50] <z1haze_> how do you change the key to your dot notation then
[13:28:56] <z1haze_> no, i haven't
[13:29:08] <z1haze_> you suggest i change it when i dont know how to obviously
[13:29:18] <z1haze_> the server response cannot be changed
[13:30:20] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing out a sample of the returned data?
[13:30:45] <robertmaxrees> so we can get some context?
[13:31:06] <z1haze_> sure
[13:32:03] <z1haze_> http://dpaste.com/3TR2FGS
[13:33:11] <robertmaxrees> so this is error.responseJSON?
[13:33:35] <z1haze_> yep
[13:33:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:33:47] <robertmaxrees> Object.keys(error.responseJSON).forEach(k => { is the wrong tool for this job
[13:34:04] <z1haze_> cool
[13:34:11] <robertmaxrees> you want to use map here
[13:34:17] <robertmaxrees> instead of explicitly pushing into the array.
[13:35:18] <z1haze_> so Object.keys(errors.responseJSON).map((i, k) => { let key ... return what?
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:35:29] <robertmaxrees> you don't want Object.jeys
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> *keys
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> oooh nvm
[13:35:39] <robertmaxrees> derp ignore me.
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[13:35:46] <taplar_> jquery080: if you comment out the regex rule it appears to work.
[13:35:56] <taplar_> i've not found the part about regex in the docs yet
[13:40:33] <Es0teric> sup robertmaxrees
[13:40:36] <Es0teric> z1haze_
[13:40:47] <z1haze_> hey
[13:42:21] <Es0teric> im freaking stuck on this again =_=
[13:42:22] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ so you're trying to get the section that appears highest on the page?
[13:42:43] <z1haze> yup
[13:44:39] <taplar_> jquery080: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/280759/jquery-validate-how-to-add-a-rule-for-regular-expression-validation  related S.O. post
[13:44:46] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah im still stuck on this man
[13:44:48] <Es0teric> =_=
[13:44:49] <z1haze> it works i just feel like if its more than a few lines to do a simple task there is a problem
[13:45:05] <taplar_> Es0teric: oh?
[13:45:23] <taplar_> did you step through the second click logic?
[13:45:27] <Es0teric> taplar_ i am trying to add the clicked state first because that means the user already reacted
[13:45:33] <robertmaxrees> z1haze don't concern yourself with length.
[13:45:35] <Es0teric> the problem is that .data() is not adding it
[13:45:37] <robertmaxrees> worry about readability.
[13:45:50] <Es0teric> taplar_ $('#buddypress').find('[data-bp-activity-id="' + obj.oneh.id + '"]').find('a[data-bp-reaction-id="oneh"]').addClass('reacted').data('clicked', 'true');
[13:46:19] <Es0teric> taplar_ thats before the code i was working on earlier that is on jsfiddle
[13:46:29] <taplar_> what have i asked you to do in the past when you pasted a selector like that? :)
[13:46:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:46:50] <Es0teric> taplar_ i dont remember
[13:47:07] <taplar_> console log the selector immediately before the logic that uses it and make sure it exists
[13:47:27] <Es0teric> it does exist..
[13:47:35] <Es0teric> the 'reacted' class is being added
[13:47:37] <Es0teric> in the DOM
[13:47:43] <taplar_> ok
[13:47:52] <taplar_> so?
[13:48:07] <taplar_> are you expecting to see the data element on the dom?
[13:48:18] <z1haze_> sorry laptop died
[13:48:27] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah
[13:48:33] <taplar_> you will not see the data element on the dom when you use jquery to set it.
[13:48:38] <z1haze_> robertmaxrees, i saw your dont worry about it message - but that being said do you have suggestions/solutions for improvements on it
[13:48:42] <taplar_> it is stored in an internal cache that jquery maintains
[13:48:47] <z1haze_> if one is to change the key to split easier, i dont know how
[13:49:00] <Es0teric> taplar_ ah i see ok
[13:49:16] <z1haze_> and so I DO want forEach now, or still no?
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ is that why you said you "can't" change the server response?
[13:49:21] <taplar_> also, don't set it to 'true', just use true
[13:49:35] <Es0teric> taplar_ yeah i figured
[13:49:35] <z1haze_> because our entire application uses the responses and all handle it that way
[13:49:37] <Es0teric> i just did that
[13:49:42] <z1haze_> this is just a new page, new functionality
[13:49:43] <Es0teric> ok taplar_ so back to the fiddle
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you should be able to safely add a field to each of those sections that's something like "group" or w/e.
[13:50:19] <z1haze_> and the way the server returns the error messages, it uses the form input names as the keys i the response
[13:50:29] <z1haze_> so billingFirstName actually beings to billingFirstName input
[13:50:49] <taplar_> aaaah, so that's literally a form name?
[13:50:51] <z1haze_> in the javascript or the html??
[13:50:55] <taplar_> err, input name
[13:50:59] <z1haze_> the error keys are the input names yea
[13:51:07] <z1haze_> but im not trying to scroll to the input just the section
[13:51:18] <taplar_> lol, my bad, i though you were appending the form name and input names together as part of the error key
[13:51:31] <z1haze_> no
[13:51:34] <z1haze_> all 1 form
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_ could you whip up a quick fiddle to show us?
[13:51:47] <robertmaxrees> because i think i have a way to make this at least a little easier.
[13:51:56] <z1haze_> not really, its all in vuejs and stuff
[13:52:04] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:52:09] <robertmaxrees> there's still html duder.
[13:52:17] <z1haze_> its just a form with those input names making an ajax call, .catch() of the ajax call returns the errors in errors.responseJSON
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you could grab the input and then just .closest() to the container you care about.
[13:52:30] <taplar_> ^
[13:52:42] <z1haze_> i could, but there are going to be multiple per section
[13:52:51] <z1haze_> as shown in the example json response
[13:53:00] <z1haze_> billingFirstName, billingLastName, billingAddress1 etc
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> so?
[13:53:25] <z1haze_> so at what point do i attempt to get the closest('section')
[13:53:46] <z1haze_> the object comes back in no particular order
[13:53:53] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[13:53:58] <z1haze_> so in the iteration it doesnt read the keys in the order they appear on the page
[13:53:59] <robertmaxrees> lemme find your apste again.
[13:54:35] <z1haze_> i can repaste i pulled some out to its own method to try to clcean up a bit
[13:54:42] <robertmaxrees> nah
[13:54:43] <robertmaxrees> no need.
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> found it - one sec.
[13:54:46] <z1haze_> ok
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> so these are IDs, right?
[13:55:55] <z1haze_> the json keys?
[13:56:01] <robertmaxrees> yes
[13:56:03] <z1haze_> no..
[13:56:06] <z1haze_> they are input names
[13:56:08] <z1haze_> name=
[13:56:13] <robertmaxrees> ah that's right.
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah so you can do something like https://bpaste.net/show/d4289d608fb9
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> that gets you the elements.
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> then you can .each() through that an in there check the .closest('whatever') for the top.
[14:00:16] <z1haze> unless im mistaken the map wont return section names
[14:00:19] <z1haze> it will return the input names
[14:00:22] <mkr2> Hi, now I have a script,, so If I type more than 5 rows the button dissapear, ---> http://jsfiddle.net/PfD7L/160/
[14:00:38] <z1haze> because the keys are the input names not sections
[14:01:11] <mkr2> but if I want more textareas it not works --->  http://jsfiddle.net/PfD7L/161/
[14:01:53] <z1haze> thats where i had that messy regex split
[14:02:02] <z1haze> that actually got me the section names
[14:03:35] <Es0teric> FINALLTY
[14:03:37] <Es0teric> I GOT IT
[14:03:55] <z1haze> ill just keep it i suppose and wont obsess over it
[14:04:09] <taplar_> mkr2: you can't repeat ids
[14:04:17] <taplar_> they are unique ids
[14:04:34] <taplar_> repeated identifiers are classes
[14:06:13] <taplar_> Es0teric: congrats
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze this is why seeing your markup would've been helpful - though iirc vue has ways to bind all of this so you're not using jquery.
[14:08:51] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[14:09:18] <z1haze> the the dom elements themselves
[14:09:21] <z1haze> only the values
[14:09:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:09:57] <z1haze> v-model allows you to 2way bind the input value to a data property
[14:10:13] <z1haze> but it doesnt give you ways to reach out and grab the actual dom element of the input
[14:11:41] <robertmaxrees> i remember experimenting with it and using something so you could update elements in page with server-data.
[14:11:43] <robertmaxrees> but (shrug)
[14:12:14] <robertmaxrees> i think we used a redux-style setup for that.
[14:12:24] <taplar_> iirc from what i remember you can give it the data and it can (should) drive the building of elements off of the data
[14:12:48] <taplar_> similar to react and angular in that aspect
[14:12:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, and you should be able to have some kind of binding that'll listen for that kind of stuff and handle things like this.
[14:13:34] <z1haze> like i said, the value of the input
[14:13:43] <robertmaxrees> nah, we definitely did more than just change values.
[14:13:53] <z1haze> theres v-show, v-if conditionals etc
[14:14:33] <robertmaxrees> https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#watch
[14:14:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah the api provides for watching data.
[14:19:08] <jquery080> taplar_: think i found what i need now http://jsfiddle.net/pcgb4moj/
[14:19:19] <jquery080> thank you
[14:19:38] <taplar_> awesome
[14:40:12] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeee
[15:05:56] <mkr2> taplar_ but if I type Classes, it wont work
[15:06:10] <taplar_> what?
[15:06:40] <mkr2> http://jsfiddle.net/PfD7L/162/
[15:07:16] <taplar_> document.getElementsByClass("ta") returns a NodeList
[15:07:33] <taplar_> not a single element.  you have to loop over them to perform whatever logic you need
[15:07:59] <mkr2> each loop
[15:07:59] <taplar_> and iirc it's getElementsByClassName
[15:08:14] <mkr2> yes, change that =)
[15:08:20] <mkr2> changed*
[15:08:30] <taplar_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName
[15:09:05] <mkr2> done =)
[15:09:14] <mkr2> http://jsfiddle.net/PfD7L/163/
[15:09:15] <taplar_> that page also has an example of loopage
[15:30:46] <mkr2> taplar_ I got it works with rows ---> http://jsfiddle.net/qxKmW/100/
[15:31:23] <taplar_> why are you doing that inner textarea lookup?
[15:31:27] <mkr2> But then I must hit "enter" .. how to get it works if I type 5 long lines with no "enter"
[15:32:38] <mkr2> It was a thing that was not needed to do, but just wanted to fix it =)
[15:33:31] <taplar_> also consider putting a wrapper around each section so you can avoid that next().next() logic
[16:26:03] <keyd> How can i do a keydown for a selecter that is created later ? im now checking on $(document).keydown($("id"), function() { .....
[16:30:18] <taplar_> $('parentSelector').on('event', 'childSelector', eventHandler)
[16:31:56] <coolternet> hello guys
[16:32:47] <coolternet> anyone can tell me why when i add a new element in my array, the new element replace the old by the new ?https://fkcd.ca/3cz
[16:33:28] <taplar_> what line?
[16:34:03] <coolternet> i have the errror  : article.push(data);
[16:34:10] <coolternet> #20
[16:34:30] <taplar_> put a console log before line 15 and see if it is going in that if conditional
[16:35:03] <taplar_> also move that var out of the if
[16:35:09] <coolternet> ho sorry dont have error for replacement i have '' article.push is not a function
[16:35:49] <taplar_> what does JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('item')); result in?
[16:35:52] <taplar_> what is that value?
[16:36:47] <coolternet> i have no idea.. a friend tell me to put item on some field llool
[16:36:54] <taplar_> so console log it
[16:37:28] <coolternet> https://fkcd.ca/iJn.txt
[16:37:35] <coolternet> when i try to add a second item
[16:37:41] <coolternet> i have that error
[16:37:45] <taplar_> not that, log the sessionStorage item
[16:38:36] <coolternet> {"pid":"2","name":"Intel Core i5-6600k","model":"BX80662I56600K","qty":1,"price":"319.99"}
[16:38:46] <taplar_> ok, so that's not an array.  that's an object
[16:39:04] <coolternet> damn
[16:39:05] <taplar_> [ 'wee', 'hi', 'yo' ] <-- that's an array
[16:48:48] <coolternet> i dont understand how can i transform my var data to array
[17:02:50] <coolternet> well now it work
[17:02:55] <coolternet> but the last item is replace
[17:03:24] <taplar_> you wouldn't turn that into an array
[17:03:35] <taplar_> you'd put your value into it as a key value pair
[17:04:16] <coolternet> atm i have an array lol ["1", "Intel Core i7-6700k", "BX80662I76700K", 1, "499.99"]
[17:05:03] <taplar_> i think i see what is going on
[17:05:21] <taplar_> the issue here is you are setting the item as a single element
[17:05:25] <taplar_> you need to set it as an array
[17:05:46] <coolternet> https://fkcd.ca/Mi8
[17:05:54] <coolternet> i put data into array no ?
[17:06:00] <taplar_> line 23 needs to stringify article
[17:07:05] <taplar_> if it doesn't exist you are creating a new array, and you are pushing the data to it.  but then you are only storing that single data in the session
[17:07:13] <taplar_> you need to store the array you created/modified
[17:59:44] <jquery080> guys can someone tell me why i cant remove this hr? https://jsfiddle.net/kpw8acom/
[18:02:33] <taplar_> closest() looks for parents
[18:03:14] <taplar_> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[18:04:50] <jquery080> ummm ok what should i use instead?
[18:05:16] <taplar_> next()
[18:06:16] <jquery080> taplar_: genius thank you
[18:06:53] <jquery080> also i got validation to work with classes after :)

[21:03:47] <fretto> hello, how would you code a reusable yes no popup in jquerymobilell ? so it can hv a different title and yes and no callbacks each time you use it throughout the code
[21:04:32] <fretto> ive seen some solutions online but they seemed clunky
