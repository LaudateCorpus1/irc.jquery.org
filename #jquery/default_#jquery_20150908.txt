[00:10:11] <Guest1000000> Hello. I have a question. I need to save all css properties of a DOM element, modify them and then later restore them. How can I copy all css properties ?
[00:10:44] <Cork> Guest1000000: you would have to loop ComputedStyle
[00:11:02] <Cork> (unless you only want to store inline css)
[00:11:45] <Guest1000000> No, I want to store the whole "css object".
[00:12:46] <Uhkis> the what
[00:12:58] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/7ag2zLuz/3/ Uhkis
[00:13:32] <Kartagis> the drupal view has been configured to filter  on the current logged in user
[00:14:41] <Cork> Guest1000000: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
[00:14:48] <Cork> you need to store the values from that method
[00:14:52] <Cork> there is no css object
[00:15:34] <Uhkis> Kartagis: no one is logged in in that request
[00:15:42] <Guest1000000> If I cloned the DOM element, would it also have css props cloned ?
[00:15:50] <Cork> no
[00:16:02] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I get uid back
[00:16:21] <Guest1000000> Cork: Ah, I thought it would do the trick :) Thanx for the answer.
[00:16:24] <Kartagis> doesn't that mean success?
[00:16:25] <Cork> Guest1000000: css is separate, you have a style sheet and a style tree with selectors
[00:16:39] <Cork> Guest1000000: dom is complete independent of this
[00:18:39] <surianup> Hi
[00:19:10] <surianup> how to change the path of svg
[00:19:47] <Cork> "of svg" you mean <svg>?
[00:19:57] <surianup> yes
[00:20:05] <surianup> http://laravel.io/bin/W4DzY
[00:20:09] <surianup> I have this code
[00:20:12] <Cork> ah, you mean a path element
[00:20:18] <Uhkis> Kartagis: you get correct data back from the login, but you're not using the login in the next request
[00:20:34] <Cork> surianup: you have to reach into the svg dom and then find the path element
[00:20:43] <Cork> just like you would with an iframe
[00:20:48] <Kartagis> Uhkis: you mean data
[00:20:52] <surianup> I have find it
[00:21:08] <Kartagis> Uhkis: you mean data:{uid:data.user.uid} ?
[00:21:34] <surianup> Cork but dont know how to change, actually I need to increase the width of the tooltip
[00:22:11] <Uhkis> Kartagis: read the docs of your backend on how to make authenticated requests
[00:22:24] <surianup> Cork :can you paste the code as the .html file in
[00:22:29] <Cork> surianup: never done it, but i would expect you have to modify the d attribute
[00:22:56] <surianup> yes Cork
[00:22:58] <Cork> the path element doesn't seam to have any useful methods to use
[00:23:12] <surianup> but I don't know how to use it
[00:23:16] <surianup> and do it
[00:23:25] <Cork> well then it is time to read up on it
[00:24:00] <surianup> Cork this is the code below
[00:24:00] <surianup> details.append( 'path' )
[00:24:19] <Cork> surianup: i'm not going to code your svg modifications for you
[00:24:31] <Cork> surianup: look up on the spec on how to define the data of a path
[00:24:35] <surianup> its ok Cork don't worry
[00:24:39] <Cork> and then modify the content as you want it
[00:24:51] <Cork> surianup: i don't worry
[00:24:58] <guessx> Guest100000: this seems like it maybe what your after - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1004475/jquery-css-plugin-that-returns-computed-style-of-element-to-pseudo-clone-that-ele
[00:25:08] <surianup> Cork: thanks
[00:26:22] <Uhkis> Cork is too cool to worry :-)
[00:27:47] <Guest1000000> guessx: Thx :)
[00:28:08] <Kartagis> Uhkis: could you give me a pointer?
[00:28:42] <Kartagis> what do you mean by backend? drupal? services module?
[00:29:43] <Uhkis> "drupal rest authenticated request" sounds like a good searchphrase
[00:31:13] <Kartagis> Uhkis: cool, I'm on the right path then
[00:34:23] <STFUn00b> hi guys... i need some help
[00:34:53] <STFUn00b> i want to detect if a certain element was clicked on a whole document
[00:35:04] <STFUn00b> but let's say that this element is under some <a> element
[00:35:33] <Cork> STFUn00b: what do you mean "on a whole document"?
[00:35:46] <Cork> a specific element is a specific element, it can only be in one place
[00:35:48] <STFUn00b> like anywhere on a page
[00:35:56] <STFUn00b> yes i know
[00:36:04] <Cork> so you mean an element type or class name?
[00:36:12] <Cork> or what?
[00:36:25] <STFUn00b> i want to attach a click handler on a whole document like so $(document).click(...)
[00:36:42] <Cork> case the only way to know if a specific element has been clicked is to bind an event handler on that specific element
[00:36:45] <STFUn00b> and i want to detect if that click was no a certain element
[00:36:49] <STFUn00b> but i can't use
[00:36:52] <STFUn00b> e.target
[00:37:05] <STFUn00b> cuz maybe that element is underneath current target element
[00:37:07] <Cork> STFUn00b: make a jsfiddle about what you're trying to do
[00:37:15] <STFUn00b> kk
[00:37:28] <Cork> STFUn00b: if the element is under another element (but not a parent) it isn't clicked
[00:37:36] <Cork> so you can't use click to catch that
[00:38:00] <STFUn00b> it is a parent
[00:38:11] <Cork> the only way to do that would be to calculate the elements coordinates and then grab the mouse position
[00:38:24] <Cork> STFUn00b: then again, why not just bind a click handler on the element?
[00:38:36] <Cork> ah, make the fiddle, that most likely makes more sense
[00:38:41] <STFUn00b> k ;)
[00:38:47] <guessx> use .on :)
[00:39:18] <Cork> guessx: .click works just as well here
[00:42:32] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/e9px <--- how about this one Uhkis?
[00:42:51] <Kartagis> it's a different issue though
[00:43:16] <STFUn00b> Cork; https://jsfiddle.net/Lcu061g9/
[00:43:44] <STFUn00b> why i need this? i have a menu that slides from the sides... and any time someone clicks outside of that menu, i want to hide it
[00:44:12] <STFUn00b> but if you click on a link, which is a child of that menu, i want to leave that menu opened
[00:44:19] <Uhkis> Kartagis: what about it
[00:44:31] <Cork> STFUn00b: https://jsfiddle.net/Lcu061g9/1/
[00:44:32] <Kartagis> I can't pass nid
[00:44:58] <Cork> lol sorry wrote wrong
[00:45:31] <Cork> STFUn00b: this is what i meant to post :) https://jsfiddle.net/Lcu061g9/2/
[00:47:40] <STFUn00b> cork thanks that works...
[00:47:47] <STFUn00b> closest also checks itself ?
[00:48:12] <Cork> STFUn00b: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[00:56:02] <Uhkis> Kartagis: var nid should probably be $(this).data('nid');
[00:56:59] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I can get nid just fine, but I can't pass it
[00:57:01] <Kartagis> brb
[01:03:54] <Kartagis> back

[01:05:36] <surianup> anyone know how to change the path of an svg

[01:05:48] <surianup> I need to chnage this one
[01:05:57] <Kartagis> I wonder if I can do nid:ev.currentTarget.dataset.nid
[01:06:09] <Cork> surianup: you have to modify the values to what you want
[01:06:15] <Cork> that is what i told you before
[01:06:38] <Cork> how the values need to change you need to figure out your self though (it takes quite a bit of time to do that right)
[01:07:31] <surianup> Cork: I need to increase the with but how can know this this the width code ?
[01:07:37] <surianup> or height code
[01:07:45] <Cork> you don't
[01:07:53] <surianup> 0 % knowledge about htis
[01:08:03] <Cork> you can use svg effects to scale the image
[01:08:07] <Cork> or you can resize the svg element
[01:08:08] <Tumulte> hello
[01:08:21] <Cork> if you need to modify the path, you're in for quite a bit of pain
[01:09:02] <Tumulte> I have a "$('foo').html(data);"  and nothing is executed after it (the breakpoints aren't triggered)
[01:09:08] <Tumulte> how's that possible
[01:09:23] <surianup> Sorry Cork
[01:09:49] <surianup> but really but really disappointed
[01:10:02] <Cork> surianup: http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData
[01:10:13] <Cork> read up on the data format and modify it if you need to
[01:10:43] <Cork> Tumulte: you need to share the context for anyone to be able to answer that
[01:10:51] <Cork> (and the real code not psudo code)
[01:11:33] <Cork> surianup: the thing is, there is no "make it bigger" when you want to resize a path
[01:11:50] <Cork> you have to modify each value to a new position to get that effect, i've done it and it isn't fun
[01:12:23] <Cork> surianup: if you need help to understand how the data string works i recommend asking in #svg
[01:13:19] <surianup> thanks
[01:14:01] <Cork> but again, don't expect someone to do the work for you
[01:14:13] <Cork> support channels is here to answer questions, not do your job
[01:22:04] <Tumulte> Cork: it's more of a general question is it possible that html() somehow takes too much time and prevents the next action to work properly
[01:22:21] <Cork> no
[01:22:36] <Cork> Tumulte: html isn't async so it can't "take too much time"
[01:22:41] <Tumulte> damn... I have no clue then. But plain JS works
[01:23:07] <Cork> if you give .html a string what it does (except for some checks for script tags and so on)
[01:23:21] <Cork> or basically just elm.innerHTML = string
[01:24:06] <Kartagis> yay!
[01:25:05] * Uhkis throws confetti
[01:25:43] <Kartagis> I was able to pass the nid
[01:44:04] <Kartagis> https://paste.debian.net/310795/ <--- how do I access field_ten_rengi? isn't it data.nodes.field_ten_rengi?
[01:44:09] * Kartagis runs
[01:45:07] <Cork> Kartagis: data[0].node.field_ten_rengi
[01:45:14] <Kartagis> gah
[01:45:19] <Kartagis> thanks
[01:45:23] <Cork> you missed the array
[01:47:09] <Kartagis> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'node' of undefined
[01:48:17] <Uhkis> data.nodes[0].
[01:48:33] <Cork> -_-'
[01:48:41] <Cork> ya, nodes is the array not data...
[01:50:07] <Kartagis> undefined :S
[01:52:20] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/os7j0zut/
[01:52:32] <Cork> i recommend to use a tool to pretty print the json
[01:52:36] <Cork> it makes life much simpler
[01:52:41] <Kartagis> it was data.nodes[0].node.
[01:52:52] <Kartagis> which is strange
[01:52:54] <Uhkis> *facepalm*
[01:53:06] <Cork> Kartagis: no it isn't
[01:53:09] <Kartagis> field_ten_rengi is not in node
[01:53:13] <Cork> strange i mean
[01:53:15] <Cork> Kartagis: it is
[01:53:18] <Uhkis> need to start hilighting more
[01:53:29] <toomus> Hi all
[01:53:43] <Cork> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/os7j0zut/1/
[01:53:43] <toomus> How to get last line from textarea?
[01:54:06] <SirLagz> toomus: why do you want to get the last line from a textarea?
[01:54:23] <Cork> toomus: var arr = $('textarea').val().split('\n'); arr[arr.length - 1]
[01:54:27] <toomus> It's complicated ;)
[01:55:20] <toomus> Cork: But what if content of textarea don't have new line symbols?
[01:55:43] <Cork> toomus: ('textarea').val().split('\n').match(/[^\n]+$/)[0] then
[01:55:57] <Cork> opps
[01:56:01] <Cork> toomus: ('textarea').val().match(/[^\n]+$/)[0] then
[01:56:39] <Uhkis> toomus: wouldn't the first line be the last line too in that case
[01:56:58] <SirLagz> this sounds like an XY problem
[01:57:13] <Uhkis> a what problem?
[01:57:15] <Cork> he means "at most the last line"
[01:57:34] <Cork> and ya, the regex would do that
[01:57:43] <SirLagz> well. I'll leave the experts to it.
[01:57:44] <toomus> Yeah regex doesn't work
[01:57:51] <Cork> only problem is it will give you undefined if the textarea is empty
[01:58:06] <Cork> toomus: doesn't?
[01:58:13] <Cork> it should work fine
[01:58:29] <toomus> OK, it works, but not as expected :)
[01:58:55] <Cork> toomus: it implements what you asked for
[01:59:10] <Cork> toomus: note textarea wraps, and there isn't much you can do to figure out that
[01:59:22] <Cork> *figure that out*
[01:59:48] <toomus> Cork: this is tricky
[01:59:53] <Cork> it is
[02:00:03] <Cork> done this before, before i knew to avoid it :)
[02:00:26] <Cork> and if you want the "real" last line you have to do a ton of computations
[02:00:46] <Cork> and actually render the text to know the dimensions of the text
[02:00:58] <Cork> basically you need to reproduce the math the browser does
[02:01:08] <Cork> === not something you should do
[02:01:22] <toomus> Cork: I need this, because I'm maikng Emoji emoticons suggestion box, and I need to calculate position where this box should appear
[02:01:56] <toomus> Cork: suggestions just like Github has :)
[02:03:21] <Cork> toomus: it is a ton of work to do that
[02:03:37] <Cork> the browser doesn't expose a way to get the current caret position is px
[02:03:54] <Cork> so you have to calculate the size of each character, and where they would wrap
[02:04:02] <toomus> Cork: I have 95% of work done :)
[02:04:09] <Cork> except the hard part :)
[02:04:45] <Cork> i would prob just use the mouse cursor position
[02:04:57] <Cork> and put it at the top left of the textarea if it is outside the textarea
[02:06:17] <toomus> Cork: top position of suggestion box is pretty simple to calculate.
[02:06:24] <Cork> sure
[02:06:32] <Cork> but the position of the caret isn't
[02:06:34] <toomus> Cork: I have problem with left position
[02:07:24] <toomus> Cork: Caret plugin is very useful to find caret position
[03:27:43] <arup_r> Hi I am using http://tamerayd.in/jquery-easyselect/ . I did exactly what documentation said,,, but I am facing an issue which is - The characters I am putting to search there.. Is staying there.. While doing page reload. The input characters should be blank.
[03:33:39] <SemiNus> hi
[03:34:56] <SemiNus> I am looking for a jquery script (hopefully such a script already exists)  which supports  tags and live-search
[03:35:03] <SemiNus> Like this:
[03:35:04] <SemiNus> https://www.yogaeasy.de/videos
[03:35:09] <SemiNus> any ideas, please?
[03:57:27] <arup_r> How can I iterate to the collection returned by this $('.easyselect-field.easyselect-profile-field') ?
[04:00:34] <Cork> arup_r: .each() ?
[04:00:45] <arup_r> yes.. just got it
[04:12:32] <arup_r> Cork: worked.. Can you tell me the difference between these 2 constructs ? https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/52bfbbf62e027b3d9a83
[04:12:53] <Cork> arup_r: none
[04:13:10] <Cork> arup_r: the first use .ready directly, the second uses it through the $() function
[04:13:58] <dommon> hi I'm after a recomendation of a plugin that takes a ul/li list and converts it in to a time line format, except I'm looking for a slim time line - is anyone awhere of one ?
[04:13:59] <arup_r> Well I was trying to clear the some input field values.. It did work when I kept it $(document).ready(function() {  .. but not with the other one.
[04:14:12] <arup_r> That is why I thought there might be a difference
[04:14:37] <Cork> arup_r: you're sure you did $(function() {}) and not (function() {})()?
[04:14:48] <Cork> cause $(func) === $(document).ready(func)
[04:15:39] <arup_r> let me check
[04:16:41] <arup_r> I did $(function() { }) ; but didn't work that piece of code
[04:16:57] <Cork> arup_r: not likely
[04:17:22] <arup_r> Cork: No idea :/
[04:24:25] <taplar> man holidays are never long enough, :( heh
[04:36:14] <arup_r> taplar: After retirement .. it is forever
[04:38:21] <taplar> true
[04:42:14] <taplar> wow that's a depressing way to start the day, lol
[04:54:15] <arup_r> taplar: hahaha
[05:20:51] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I've 4 articles and now I want to add an wrapper before the first article and the last article if there's more than 4 articles on the page, if there's not more than 4 articles on the page then it should just ignore it, I'm trying out with .after() and the .before() but I can't get it to work out. Also, I want to have the wrappers wrap every 4 article, since I've a row of them and I want some margin within every row
[05:28:34] <printForever> I'm having a weird thing going on one of the pages. There is an event being fired after I click/focus an input field - tooltip appears. I cant find it in the jQuery/JS code.
[05:28:51] <printForever> How do I trace it? Is there some break function in the console?
[05:29:04] <printForever> I want to find it and disable it.
[05:32:10] <printForever> found it Chrome > Inspect > Console > Search
[05:32:21] <printForever> now, how do I disable it?
[05:37:16] <printForever> Hey, guys?
[05:40:21] <Pazician> printForever: Hello
[05:42:21] <printForever> Pazician, hello back
[05:44:35] <printForever> Is there a way to stop the code snippet from executing?
[05:48:37] <Pazician> printForever: return false;?
[05:51:11] <Pazician> How do I remove a closing tag from .after() and .before()?
[05:51:26] <Cork> Pazician: you can't
[05:51:26] <Kartagis> Uhkis: in case you are interested, http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/124219/drupal-services-3-login-and-csrf
[05:51:40] <Cork> Pazician: jquery (and the browser) works with dom tree, not html
[05:51:47] <Cork> so you don't have closingtags
[05:51:50] <Cork> you have nodes
[05:52:09] <Pazician> Cork: I see, did you read my question and if you did, could you maybe have a solution for me?
[05:52:23] <Cork> Pazician: i didn't read the original question no
[05:52:36] <Pazician> Cork: Hello everyone. I've 4 articles and now I want to add an wrapper before the first article and the last article if there's more than 4 articles on the page, if there's not more than 4 articles on the page then it should just ignore it, I'm trying out with .after() and the .before() but I can't get it to work out. Also, I want to have the wrappers wrap every 4 article, since I've a row of them and I want some margin within every row
[05:52:38] <Cork> Pazician: try .wrap
[05:52:44] <Cork> opps
[05:52:48] <Cork> sorry .wrapAll
[05:53:29] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, reading on it now - thank you so much!
[05:53:33] <Cork> Pazician: so $('article').wrapAll('<section>') for example
[05:53:44] <c0d3n4m3> Is it possible, in a custom jquery plugin, to have multiple options, as in, options that pertain to CSS for the targeted object passed to the funcvtion, but then also set options for the children of the targeted object, for a gallery plugin kinda thing?
[05:53:55] <Pazician> Cork: Thank you, I'll try it out
[05:54:11] <printForever> why are you a$$hats helping Pazician and not me?
[05:54:21] <printForever> thats not fair I came first :P
[05:54:25] <c0d3n4m3> that won't get you any help lol
[05:54:34] <Kartagis> indeed
[05:54:35] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: depends on how you write the plugin
[05:54:37] <printForever> btw. I solved the problem
[05:54:39] <printForever> :)
[05:54:44] <c0d3n4m3> So the user could set options for the targeted element, and then also set options for the children
[05:54:49] <c0d3n4m3> thanks Cork
[05:54:53] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: plugins can do most anything
[05:55:02] <Cork> though that said, you should keep your css out of js
[05:55:16] <Cork> it should be kept in the stylesheat
[05:55:26] <c0d3n4m3> I was hoping to be able to give the user the option to set the gallery items width/height
[05:55:36] <c0d3n4m3> I see what you mean though
[05:55:41] <Cork> why not just have the css control that?
[05:55:59] <Cork> provide them with a small .css file with "defaults"
[05:56:05] <Cork> then they can change it how ever they want
[05:56:07] <c0d3n4m3> Ah, ok, got you :)
[05:56:31] <c0d3n4m3> Nice idea. I was purely doing this in the plugin file, but thinking that way makes it a lot easier. :)
[05:56:33] <c0d3n4m3> Thank you
[05:56:53] <Cork> c0d3n4m3: have a look at how jquery-ui works
[05:56:58] <Cork> they have a very clean implementation
[05:57:04] <c0d3n4m3> Ok :) I'll do that now
[05:57:17] <Cork> they have one .css file for functionality (no look) and one set for theming
[05:57:48] <Cork> js should handle adding dynamic elements and "functionality" the style should be classes nothing else
[05:57:49] <c0d3n4m3> Brilliant, I'll check it out! :) Muchos Gracias!
[05:57:55] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, I tried the .wrapAll() but I can't get it to work, am I doing something wrong? http://pastebin.com/R0L9fh62
[05:58:22] <Cork> Pazician: make a jsfiddle including the article elements (i don't care about there content)
[05:58:56] <Cork> Pazician: also the if case doesn't look right
[05:59:12] <Cork> you want it to only add the wrapper if you have 8 articles?
[05:59:18] <Cork> (4+4)
[05:59:53] <Cork> i would drop the slice on line 1
[06:00:43] <Pazician> Cork: I want it to add the wrapper only if there's more than 4 posts, so it it's like 5 posts then it should add the wrapper, otherwise no - here's the jsFiddle https://jsfiddle.net/99egrau3/
[06:01:39] <Cork> Pazician: https://jsfiddle.net/99egrau3/1/
[06:01:58] <Cork> your code requires 9+ posts not 5+
[06:02:25] <Cork> as you first drop the first 4 posts
[06:02:39] <Cork> and then check if what you have left is more then 4 posts
[06:03:37] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, how can I add it to begin on every 4th posts?
[06:06:00] <Pazician> Cork: Can I use nth-child or is there any other way?
[06:08:08] <toomus> I have textarea and I want to make it submitable with ENTER, but still allow user to make new line with SHIFT+ENTER
[06:09:18] <toomus> How to distinguish ENTER and SHIFT+ENTER?
[06:09:35] <Cork> Pazician: https://jsfiddle.net/99egrau3/2/
[06:10:19] <Cork> toomus: check for event.shiftKey on keydown
[06:10:38] <Cork> enter you have to check for the keyCode
[06:13:22] <Pazician> Cork: Big thanks bro, well done!
[06:14:54] <jeffreylevesque> trying to detect the mime type of https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json.  I thought https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L63 would say it's `application/mime`, but it is not recognized
[06:15:04] <toomus> Cork: THX :)
[06:45:40] <YamakasY> hi guys!
[06:47:43] <YamakasY> I know how to use jquery and get response and use that but I need to hack something into someone his code which is not available atm... I have the source, that is no issue but as I use the same frontend on a different backedn (which is just some temp page) I wonder if I can make a test in my PHP to see if I get the json parsed the way it normally is done in the source code... I see the response in firebug of course, what's the b
[06:51:01] <PlanC> are there any downsides to .html()?
[06:51:14] <PlanC> I'm putting an ad-script inside it, but it's not executing
[06:51:23] <PlanC> however, when I use document.write() it works perfectly
[07:01:18] <jeffreylevesque> is mimetype detection built into the browser?
[07:03:42] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: you mean for responses from the server?
[07:04:14] <Cork> if yes, then for a few cases, but you should ALWAYS return the correct Content-Type from the server
[07:07:24] <YamakasY> can I emulate some response ?
[07:44:57] <jeffreylevesque> Cork: like https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L63, https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L83
[07:45:14] <jeffreylevesque> those logic pieces depend on the browser support for mime types?
[07:46:20] <Cork> ah file picker mime type
[07:46:33] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: yes, the browser provides the mimetype (it asks the os)
[07:47:01] <jeffreylevesque> Cork because when i pass my file https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json, it doesn't recognize the json mimetype
[07:47:13] <jeffreylevesque> i had another machine, where the same logic worked
[07:47:21] <Cork> uh
[07:47:33] <Cork> well does the os have an entry for .json?
[07:47:38] <jeffreylevesque> yeah
[07:47:44] <Cork> hmm then you should
[07:48:04] <jeffreylevesque> nvm i checked the VM
[07:48:10] <jeffreylevesque> i need to check the host machine
[07:48:55] <jeffreylevesque> probably need to add the json mimetype to my windows 7 host machine
[07:49:10] <jeffreylevesque> since my vm port forwards to the host
[07:49:23] <Cork> ya
[07:52:35] <jeffreylevesque> so i need to add json mimetype on the windows host
[07:52:43] <jeffreylevesque> not the apache/flask server on the virtual machine?
[07:53:40] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: the browser doesn't contact the server to know what the file it is about to post is :)
[07:53:51] <Cork> so yes it is the CLIENT that needs to know what the file type is
[08:00:20] <YamakasY> can I check why a post gives back a full html as response ? I know when it happens (I add some .js) but I need to see where it fails
[08:01:08] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: hmmm?
[08:01:19] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: presumably the server you are POSTing too would know more about that
[08:01:36] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: yes can check those logs also
[08:01:37] <YamakasY> :)
[08:01:58] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: that's the only machine that knows why it sent back what it did
[08:03:10] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: nah what happens is, I have some javascript (that works in some other case well) that fadeout, etc some other secion... now I add this .js it submits the form instead of doing the fadeout on that button
[08:05:42] <YamakasY> weird
[08:17:08] <blinky_> hi all, I am using a small scriupt to disable input fields on a form.  I have it working but would like to add to it if possible.  At the moment the inputs are disabled on load, then they are enabled if the users inputs into the search input.  However, if the user deletes all the text from the search then the inputs are all disabled again, how would I go about stopping that? - http://jsfiddle.net/v9pj3eg5/
[08:24:12] <mentoc> is it possible to create a custom event and name it so that you could do something like $("#element").bind("myCustomEvent",function(){}); ??
[08:27:18] <YamakasY> ok, can I see why my form is submitted when I include some .js file and when I don't it's not submitted ?
[08:28:19] <Mhuil> hi guys!!
[08:28:21] <YamakasY> I want to see what triggers it
[08:28:39] <robhol> are there any good sources of documentation apart from api.jquery.com? I can't really get the hang of how that thing is structured
[08:28:39] <Mhuil> how can I could to add data to $("#data").data("info")
[08:32:16] <robhol> Mhuil: doesn't .data("info", "whatever") work?
[08:33:36] <robhol> Oh, and, is there a way to "simplify"/combine this?    $(this).next("whatever").remove(); $(this).remove();
[08:35:16] <robhol> never mind, figured it out -  $(this).add($(this).next("whatever")).remove();    - although the resulting syntax is pretty ugly :/
[08:46:32] <Mhuil> robhol : what happen is I need to add dinamically info to data property
[08:47:04] <Mhuil> http://jsbin.com/majolamopa/edit?js,output
[08:47:08] <Mhuil> I have some like this
[08:47:24] <Mhuil> recordsLoaded is a function from a plugin
[08:56:29] <jeffreylevesque> when i run http://jsfiddle.net/jeff1evesque/e4fp18z9/, my json file type - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json in "Unknown"
[08:59:10] <YamakasY> erm anyone some idea how I can see why a form is posted ?
[09:02:48] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: put a 'debugger' statement somewhere
[09:03:23] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: yes good one, but the question is where
[09:03:47] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: inpector cannot show it ?
[09:04:02] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: either in your 'new' js somewhere, or somewhere around the event handler youre expecting to fire
[09:05:52] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: yeah that's the issue, it's some core thing where I need half, but you understand... when you use a static host for js... you don't wanna copy .js files every time
[09:07:11] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: I need to debug 2000 lines of code which work OK in the mainapp and are OK there and also work when I copy all other source code... kinda weird
[09:07:21] <robhol> is it generally "safe" to multi-wrap jquery objects? for example, if I take an element as an argument to a function, can I $(foo) it or will that cause problems if foo is already a jquery-wrapped element?
[09:07:31] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: you can use your browsers developer tools to set a debugging point where you like as well
[09:07:35] <robertmaxrees> robhol it's... inefficient.
[09:07:48] <robertmaxrees> the overhead isn't worth it.
[09:08:16] <robhol> fair enough.
[09:08:41] <robhol> I wasn't really planning to do it. It just seemed like the $() "wrap" operation could/should be idempotent
[09:09:17] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: ok, will check that out, but inspector doesn't show me where it goes through in a log ?
[09:09:19] <robertmaxrees> it tests to see if it's already a jquery object and just passes it through, but you still have the constructor overhead iirc
[09:09:25] <robertmaxrees> i could have that wrong though, robhol
[09:09:39] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: not in a log, but in the actual script
[09:12:33] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: but it does not give a full blowout there which stays there ?
[09:12:56] <robhol> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/JdfN2mz.png    hmmmmm :p
[09:13:11] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: i don't follow. give this a read. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/javascript/breakpoints/
[09:13:13] <robertmaxrees> robhol that's because the "same" object is not equal to itself.
[09:13:15] <robertmaxrees> that's totally expected.
[09:13:38] <robhol> right
[09:14:24] <robertmaxrees> hence var foo = {}, bar = {}; console.log(foo === bar); // prints false
[09:16:48] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: I mean, the script in general works OK, but when I just include it in some other page for some extra functions I might need the form get's submitted right away
[09:16:57] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: nobody knows
[09:17:06] <NoiseEee> YamakasY: it is up to YOU to find out, using available tools
[09:19:12] <xinming> Just curious, Is .data('attr-name') will try to decode json if the html attribute is a json string?
[09:19:52] <robertmaxrees> xinming give it a shot :)
[09:19:54] <xinming> I just found that when I use  $(...).data('attr')
[09:19:59] <xinming> robertmaxrees: I do tried,
[09:20:06] <xinming> that's why I'm curious
[09:20:21] <xinming> got it, doc specs it does
[09:21:12] <robhol> I want to create a "redacted"-style effect on all text inside of a given "match" - is there a selector or something that will take all text elements (so I can set their background color) but leave anything structural alone?
[09:22:04] <robertmaxrees> robhol wrap the elements in <span> tags and set the background color to black and the font color to black.
[09:22:14] <robertmaxrees> *wrap the relevant text in span tags, rather
[09:22:19] <robhol> it's not my HTML, making it a bit more complicated ;)
[09:22:24] <robhol> (writing a userscript)
[09:22:43] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[09:22:51] <robertmaxrees> that's not really making it more complicated.
[09:23:00] <iateadonut> hi - i was working on a script to add email addresses to a form: https://jsfiddle.net/mhdgwpuo/
[09:23:36] <robhol> I take that to mean there's no "shortcut" though. Should I go dig up my recursive contents() snippet then? :p
[09:23:41] <iateadonut> if you go there and type in an address like 'me@some.com' - it adds me@some.co and me@some.com - i'm wondering how i can delay the script execution maybe 1.5 seconds, and also, to kill all old processes.
[09:25:55] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: I know but I try to find the right tools which show me
[09:26:22] <xinming> It's really a big trouble when parseJSON doesn't parse the js objects without quote on keys.
[09:26:33] <xinming> and it seems "" is required to quote all strings.
[09:26:42] <robertmaxrees> xinming that's JSON.
[09:26:48] <xinming> Is what I got right?
[09:26:52] <xinming> I mean, My understanding
[09:27:01] <xinming> IIRC, the JSON is just javascript object simplified.
[09:27:08] <robertmaxrees> JSON and JavaScript are not the same thing
[09:27:15] <xinming> Just js without if else etc..
[09:27:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:27:19] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[09:27:28] <xinming> Thanks for the correction.
[09:27:32] <robertmaxrees> JSON requires quotes around keys.
[09:27:49] <NoiseEee> YamakasY:  give this a read, it will explain the tools available to you. https://developers.google.com/web/tools/javascript/breakpoints/
[09:27:52] <robertmaxrees> JSON is inspired by javascript, but has some strict rules around formatting that javascript doesn't have.
[09:28:09] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: oh already see a message that there is an error on the page, so JS is not loaded OK
[09:28:39] <YamakasY> NoiseEee: yes used it in the past but this is native code we use but I'm doing something wrong on code I include which is very good written ;)
[09:28:44] <YamakasY> so I try to find MY fault :D
[09:28:48] <xinming> Ok, Thanks
[09:28:49] <xinming> got it
[09:31:15] <iateadonut> if i'm running a function ram(), and it gets called several times in a second, is there a way to get ram() to kill all other ram() processes?
[09:31:27] <iateadonut> so that only the final process remains?
[09:31:29] <robertmaxrees> there's no "process" to kill.
[09:31:36] <robertmaxrees> there's only a single thread.  is it an ajax call?
[09:31:44] <iateadonut> it is not an ajax call.
[09:31:55] <robertmaxrees> then what is there to "kill"
[09:32:12] <iateadonut> i don't know.
[09:32:17] <iateadonut> i guess i can spoof and ajax call!
[09:32:20] <robertmaxrees> wut.
[09:32:33] <robertmaxrees> slow your roll there - your question makes no sense.
[09:32:39] <iateadonut> you're pretty smart, robertmaxrees
[09:32:47] <robertmaxrees> function calls are synchronous
[09:32:52] <robertmaxrees> so there's nothing to "call"
[09:32:56] <robertmaxrees> err, *kill
[09:33:25] <iateadonut> if you go here: https://jsfiddle.net/mhdgwpuo/ - and type me@me.com in the form input, you'll see the problem i'm trying to solve.
[09:33:59] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[09:34:01] <robertmaxrees> let's back up here.
[09:34:06] <iateadonut> but i think sending an ajax call will work
[09:34:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.,
[09:34:20] <robertmaxrees> you're making some assumptions here.
[09:34:30] <robertmaxrees> let's clean this up :)
[09:34:54] <rindolf> Hi all.
[09:36:20] <robertmaxrees> iateadonut so first off: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhdgwpuo/1/
[09:37:36] <robertmaxrees> your .delay() call was strange and unnecessary.
[09:37:56] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to only show one suggestion at a time, iateadonut?
[09:38:16] <iateadonut> i was hoping to delay it so further processes would keep killing old processes.
[09:38:32] <robertmaxrees> there's only one "process" going on here.
[09:38:35] <iateadonut> sorry that i'm using incorrect terminology; i'm certainly open to correction
[09:38:46] <robertmaxrees> javascript is not multi-threaded, so that doesn't make any sense.
[09:38:57] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you only want one suggestion to appear at a time?
[09:39:30] <iateadonut> i'd like it to delay .5 seconds or so to see if the person will add, for example, an 'm' after typing '.co'
[09:40:47] <robertmaxrees> so as somebody with a lot of experience, 2 things about that - 1. you think you want a throttle.  2. - you're assuming people type at a certain speed.
[09:41:06] <iateadonut> yes
[09:41:14] <robertmaxrees> don't do either of those.
[09:41:20] <iateadonut> i understand
[09:41:58] <iateadonut> so what is your suggestion?
[09:42:48] <NoiseEee> check for the email when the user has finished typing?
[09:43:00] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mhdgwpuo/2/
[09:43:55] <YamakasY> ok it seems that some variable in some function is not defined
[09:44:01] <YamakasY> first food befor I die
[09:44:02] <YamakasY> die()
[09:44:42] <robertmaxrees> iateadonut so go with something like this, but now there's another question - why are you suggesting an email i've already entered?
[09:46:01] <iateadonut> it's adding an email to 'emailTo[]' - my hope was to have it be more fluid so you wouldn't have to click an 'add' button.
[09:46:10] <iateadonut> but i guess i'll just do that.
[09:46:11] <robertmaxrees> have what be more fluid?
[09:46:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what your end goal is.
[09:46:20] <iateadonut> entering multiple email addresses.
[09:46:27] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: gimme me some donut too!
[09:47:43] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody, I've a problem, I have a clock made with javascript, it only shows the current time, that part is easy, but it should show the server time, my problem is when the client has a different time, only seconds, it will fail, somebody knows a good way to sync the time against the server time ?
[09:47:43] <robertmaxrees> iateadonut you really want something more like a tagging setup.
[09:48:17] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 populate a variable in the page with the server time on load and display that, updating it every second.
[09:48:32] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 or publish the UTC offset and use something like moment.js and go that route
[09:49:07] <Germanaz0> to use moment, is a smart idea
[09:49:29] <Germanaz0> the thing to publish the time and increase every second, is that the clock is not well accurated using setInterval
[09:49:36] <Germanaz0> setInterval lose some miliseconds sync
[09:49:39] <iateadonut> robertmaxrees, what would be a good keyword to google to learn about a 'tagging setup'?
[09:49:48] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 what are you actually trying to build?
[09:49:58] <Germanaz0> a widget clock
[09:50:05] <Germanaz0> showing my server time
[09:50:23] <Germanaz0> the problem is that when I have for example, 00:00:00 and the client has 00:03:05
[09:50:35] <Germanaz0> is not showing well the minut and seconds
[09:50:47] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 that's why you use moment and poll the client for its current time, then display that time.
[09:50:54] <Germanaz0> well that example is not good, is when I have 00:00:00 and the client 03:05:45
[09:51:29] <Germanaz0> doing the time difference, shows 00:05:45
[09:51:37] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 doens't change my point.  if you really need the client and the server to be identical, don't update client-side at all.
[09:51:52] <robertmaxrees> refresh the page or use ajax/sockets to update on a fixed interval.
[09:52:02] <robertmaxrees> iateadonut search for something like "jquery tagging"
[09:52:18] <Germanaz0> robbyoconnor: but the fixed interval is still wrong
[09:52:29] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 that's why you ask the server on the interval.
[09:52:34] <Germanaz0> I could not fix the difference
[09:52:48] <Germanaz0> I will show you a code
[09:52:50] <robertmaxrees> Germanaz0 which is why you ask the server for its time and offset to the client-side time.
[09:52:56] <robertmaxrees> like, you have to pick one or the other.
[09:53:03] <robertmaxrees> the client and server will never agree on the current time.
[09:53:16] <Germanaz0> no
[09:53:23] <robertmaxrees> so if you need things to "sync", you need to use one and offset to get the other.
[09:53:37] <Germanaz0> now I'm a bit lost
[09:53:41] <robertmaxrees> if you care more about the server time, ask it and then offset for the client.  but the two will never match.
[09:54:34] <Germanaz0> would you mind to show me an example ?
[09:54:41] <Germanaz0> I will show you what I've first
[09:54:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:55:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to write anything for you - i'm telling you that the client and server clocks will never be accurate against one another.
[09:55:34] <Germanaz0> ok, so I should use server clock to get offset
[09:55:36] <Germanaz0> from client side
[09:55:55] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even display the client side time to the user.
[09:56:04] <robertmaxrees> they have a clock on their screen already.
[09:56:11] <Germanaz0> true
[09:56:35] <Germanaz0> but my clock need to tick
[09:56:39] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:56:45] <Germanaz0> to discount seconds
[09:56:53] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be imprecise then.
[09:57:08] <Germanaz0> and how to update that clock always ?
[09:57:14] <Germanaz0> if I'm using the server time
[09:57:17] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to use something like socket.io
[09:57:41] <robertmaxrees> or ditch the seconds and reload the widget/refresh the data every x minutes.
[09:58:02] <Germanaz0> how do you mean to "ditch seconds"
[09:58:09] <robertmaxrees> don't display seconds.
[09:58:26] <Germanaz0> ah
[09:58:32] <Germanaz0> I liked more socket.io option
[09:58:39] <Germanaz0> to have a socket open, updating every second
[09:58:47] <robertmaxrees> you could try that.
[09:58:49] <robertmaxrees> just seems silly.
[09:58:55] <Germanaz0> yes
[09:59:03] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a lot of work to know a server's time.
[09:59:05] <Germanaz0> I was trying to synch with offsets, and relay seconds the clock
[09:59:12] <Germanaz0> but I was always getting a difference
[09:59:13] <robertmaxrees> why not just ssh into the box and check?
[09:59:14] <Germanaz0> not accurated
[09:59:26] <robertmaxrees> like, why do you need the time that bad?
[09:59:56] <Germanaz0> its for a web game, when the server clock means something for players
[10:00:08] <Germanaz0> according to seconds, it will show items, etc
[10:00:11] <robertmaxrees> then you'd definitely need socket.io to sync everything.
[10:00:14] <Germanaz0> I can't show wrong seconcds
[10:00:36] <robertmaxrees> because now you're managing state across a whole lot of clients.
[10:01:14] <Germanaz0> yes
[10:01:20] <Germanaz0> I did not found a good solution
[10:01:35] <Germanaz0> using ajax+relay times+offsets
[10:01:40] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:01:43] <robertmaxrees> you need sockets.
[10:01:55] <Germanaz0> fair enough
[10:02:15] <robertmaxrees> never trust the client clock in that case.  it'll never be accurate.
[10:02:25] <Germanaz0> thanks a lot for the help
[10:02:28] <Germanaz0> and long polling
[10:02:31] <Germanaz0> instead socket
[10:02:33] <Germanaz0> could work ?
[10:02:50] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use sockts
[10:02:53] <robertmaxrees> *sockets
[10:03:00] <Germanaz0> dunno
[10:03:03] <Germanaz0> I will use sockets
[10:03:16] <Germanaz0> but would know if could bug long polling
[10:03:26] <robertmaxrees> i'd favor sockets.
[10:03:36] <Germanaz0> yes me too
[10:03:47] <Germanaz0> thanks a lot for help
[10:06:04] <marcelofb> hello
[10:06:36] <taplar> aloha
[10:06:42] <robertmaxrees> yo
[10:06:51] <claytonzaugg> Does jQuery or jQuery UI automatically add a div with class ui-checkbox to any checkbox?
[10:07:23] <taplar> claytonzaugg: wouldn't think so
[10:07:32] <robertmaxrees> not unless you tell it to iirc.
[10:08:01] <claytonzaugg> Because my bit of code is always getting destroyed from the addition of an outter div with class ui-checkbox and a ton of other classes assigned to my label, ui-btn ui-corner-all ui-btn-inherit ui-btn-icon-left ui-checkbox-on
[10:08:15] <marcelofb> i'm building a calculator and i'm trying to pass the values "+", "-", "/" and "*" to the display, but it onlt works with "-". What am I doing wrong? http://paste.ofcode.org/BhB5pW9QAfw7B96Mgd3Bdi
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb special chars - use data attributes for this instead.
[10:10:27] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hg7zyp87/
[10:12:45] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, it still work only with "-"
[10:12:51] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[10:13:37] <robertmaxrees> or update the above one, since apparently i don't know what your issue is, then :)
[10:14:34] <claytonzaugg> is there a guide to help me build example 2 without a checkbox? http://callmenick.com/post/css-toggle-switch-examples
[10:15:47] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, take a look, only "-" works
[10:15:52] <taplar> your wanting a toggle with just the animation?
[10:16:07] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb look where?
[10:16:38] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, http://jsfiddle.net/hg7zyp87/1/
[10:16:51] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb that's not how you use jsfiddle lol
[10:17:01] <taplar> you got html in your js area
[10:17:09] <taplar> (boom)
[10:17:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hg7zyp87/2/
[10:17:24] <robertmaxrees> move all the js into the js area.
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> pop it back here when you're done :)
[10:17:44] <robertmaxrees> also: you're making this much harder on yourself.
[10:18:55] <taplar> is this a homework assignment?  or are we seriously reinventing a calculator for a webpage?
[10:19:17] <marcelofb> homework
[10:19:23] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[10:19:27] <robertmaxrees> don't use IDs here.
[10:20:06] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing your problems, and you don't want them anyway.
[10:22:01] <taplar> also all those separate inline scripts look nasty, imho
[10:22:14] <taplar> you could condense them in one at th eend
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:25:14] <marcelofb> yes i know but it's more like a question of study method
[10:25:27] <taplar> huh?
[10:25:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:25:52] <robertmaxrees> the way you're doing this is wrong.
[10:26:08] <robertmaxrees> you only need a single .click() at the very end.
[10:26:30] <robertmaxrees> and you don't need to use IDs whatsoever.  in fact, the IDs are what are causing this to not work.
[10:27:30] <marcelofb> but ir i remove the id's nothing works
[10:27:43] <robertmaxrees> right - you'll need to update your js as well.
[10:27:57] <robertmaxrees> you can do a single class selector instead.
[10:29:46] <taplar> marcelofb: concept http://jsfiddle.net/v099brsh/
[10:29:51] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:29:53] <robertmaxrees> don't do it for him.
[10:29:58] <robertmaxrees> it's his homework yo.
[10:30:13] <taplar> i just showed the delegate with a couple buttons
[10:30:15] <robertmaxrees> gotta learn to ask the hard questions.
[10:32:35] <jeffreylevesque> can someone use any (online) tool of their choice, or tell me which to use, and verify the mimetype for https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json
[10:33:02] <robertmaxrees> wut
[10:33:05] <jeffreylevesque> i was using - http://mime.ritey.com/, and it said "application/octet-stream"
[10:33:29] <robertmaxrees> of that page?
[10:33:36] <robertmaxrees> or of what?
[10:33:58] <jeffreylevesque> i tried building my own js validation logic - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L83, and added `application/octet-stream", but it did not recognize the mime type
[10:34:08] <robertmaxrees> of that actual URL?
[10:34:23] <jeffreylevesque> trying to get the mime type of https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json
[10:34:31] <robertmaxrees> that page would not have the correct mime type.
[10:34:40] <robertmaxrees> because that's an actual full html page.
[10:34:46] <jeffreylevesque> and building it correspondingly in  https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L83
[10:34:54] <jeffreylevesque> i mean i have the code locally
[10:34:59] <jeffreylevesque> but, it's on github too
[10:35:06] <jeffreylevesque> i used my local copy
[10:35:51] <robertmaxrees> the mime type is determined by your server.
[10:35:57] <robertmaxrees> so you need to set that locally.
[10:36:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Securing_your_site/Configuring_server_MIME_types
[10:36:17] <jeffreylevesque> i use a VM inside vagrant, and port-forward
[10:36:27] <robertmaxrees> the server within vagrant needs to have it set.
[10:36:28] <jeffreylevesque> so i access my program on the host machine, not in the vm
[10:36:32] <jeffreylevesque> ah
[10:37:29] <jeffreylevesque> i goto /etc/mime/types, and json mimetypes are included in there
[10:37:45] <jeffreylevesque> `/etc/mime.types`, so i don't understand why it's complaining
[10:37:57] <robertmaxrees> your server application software.
[10:38:00] <robertmaxrees> not the OS
[10:38:15] <robertmaxrees> what server are you using?
[10:38:19] <jeffreylevesque> flask
[10:38:33] <jeffreylevesque> http://flask.pocoo.org/
[10:38:42] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11774026/923919
[10:38:55] <robertmaxrees> looks like the second arg to Response
[10:39:13] <robertmaxrees> Response(yourJSON, mimetype='application/json')
[10:39:32] <eminencehc> I am trying to loop through each input with a class selector. The purpose is to show or hide related fields. For some reason I can get it to work on change function, but not onload. Why might this code not be working as I want it to? https://gist.github.com/EminenceHC/ca5657d28b10f71a2e2b
[10:39:45] <jeffreylevesque> this involves backend logic, right?  I mean my jquery mime test, is all front end
[10:40:00] <jeffreylevesque> within "jQuery validate" plugin library
[10:40:03] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque the backend needs to have the correct mime type.
[10:40:08] <robertmaxrees> jquery has nothing to do with that part.
[10:40:26] <robertmaxrees> eminencehc open your dev tools.
[10:40:31] <jeffreylevesque> what if my application is all front end
[10:40:32] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy to see what the issue is :)
[10:40:42] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque flask still controls the mime type.
[10:40:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure how else to phrase that.
[10:40:51] <robertmaxrees> mime type is controlled by the server.
[10:41:27] <robertmaxrees> eminencehc if ($(this).val == "1") { - you want if ($(this).val() === '1') {
[10:41:34] <jeffreylevesque> my jquery validate, validates csv, and xml.. and i never defined anything for that
[10:41:47] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque because none of that has anything to do with anything
[10:42:00] <robertmaxrees> your server needs to specify the correct mime type.
[10:42:14] <eminencehc> robertmaxrees: Oh, thanks. I need to go read more about jquery conditionals I suppose.
[10:42:15] <jeffreylevesque> but, it's a file upload from the client side
[10:42:23] <robertmaxrees> eminencehc it was .val vs .val()
[10:42:30] <jeffreylevesque> i upload the file, and validate it, before it's sent to the server side
[10:42:44] <eminencehc> robertmaxrees: OMG. sorry
[10:42:44] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque you mean you validate it before you upload it?
[10:42:51] <jeffreylevesque> yes sir
[10:43:24] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque so you mean you need to change the mime type of the file you're uplodaing?  if it's a file, the octet-stream is the correct one.
[10:43:41] <jeffreylevesque> i just want my "jquery validate" to allow it
[10:43:58] <jeffreylevesque> so i want to find exactly what mime type https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json is
[10:44:05] <robertmaxrees> none until you specify it.
[10:44:15] <jeffreylevesque> so, i can add it to the jquery-validate plugin implementation https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L83
[10:44:20] <robertmaxrees> if you're uploading a file, the octet-type one you had earlier is the correct one.
[10:44:55] <robertmaxrees> because it's a file.  if you were shipping straight JSON accross as just text, not within a file, it'd be a different story.
[10:45:22] <jeffreylevesque> jquery-validate is saying it's "octet-type" or any of 'text/plain', 'text/csv', 'text/xml', 'application/xml', 'application/json'
[10:45:33] <robertmaxrees> octet-type then
[10:45:34] <jeffreylevesque> **is saying it's not "octet-type" or any of 'text/plain', 'text/csv', 'text/xml', 'application/xml', 'application/json'
[10:45:48] <robertmaxrees> what's it saying it is then?
[10:45:59] <jeffreylevesque> it's not text/javascript, or application/javascript
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:46:06] <robertmaxrees> because it's a file.
[10:46:10] <robertmaxrees> files are not either of those.
[10:46:23] <jeffreylevesque> can i inspect the file through console somehow, and determine
[10:46:37] <robertmaxrees> try application/octet-stream
[10:46:39] <jeffreylevesque> like `element.files[0].type`, adjusted?
[10:47:44] <jeffreylevesque> i have `application/octet-stream`, but my logic fails it, meaning it doesn't recognize the json file as octet
[10:48:11] <robertmaxrees> and application/json fails?
[10:48:52] <robertmaxrees> if so, make a fiddle.
[10:55:27] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying to do two things: 1. is getElementsById where the id is dynamic and 2. based on whether the element is checked or not (it's a radio) the href value of a link will change http://pastebin.com/cUJhLU4a
[10:56:19] <robertmaxrees> there is no such thing as getElementsById
[10:56:34] <robertmaxrees> you can use a partial attribute selector, but just give the elements in question a class.
[10:56:59] <islalobo> Sorry, getElementById (I had been trying to do it with getElementsByClassName)
[10:57:11] <robertmaxrees> why use either if you have jquery?
[10:57:24] <islalobo> I don't follow
[10:57:34] <robertmaxrees> why not use $()
[10:58:23] <robertmaxrees> also, what is $('.set-as-my-clinic').href('/icrs/user-registration?id=' + elem); trying to do?
[10:58:51] <islalobo> Trying to replace the href value of a link
[10:59:01] <robertmaxrees> so what is elem supposed to be?
[10:59:25] <robertmaxrees> because that's currently an entire DOM node - you can't add that onto a string.
[10:59:32] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to append the text of that node?
[10:59:37] <islalobo> That's the var defined above. The array that is returned is dynamic so I need something that is flexible. I'm trying to aim towards that.
[10:59:48] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense.
[10:59:51] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[11:00:27] <islalobo> Okay, I didn't know it was an entire DOM. I was trying to just get the value.
[11:01:43] <robertmaxrees> also, you can just do jQuery(function($) {}); instead of the iife and the document ready.
[11:01:48] <robertmaxrees> that'll do the exact same thing
[11:03:14] <islalobo> I'll try to make a fiddle
[11:06:53] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/kmxqgzzb/2/
[11:07:19] <robertmaxrees> so first off you need to give those all the same name.
[11:07:30] <robertmaxrees> and second off use a class to select them.
[11:08:21] <islalobo> The same class?
[11:08:30] <robertmaxrees> on all inputs, yes.
[11:09:05] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kmxqgzzb/5/
[11:09:06] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[11:11:47] <monk3y> Sorry to lurk islalobo & robertmaxrees, and just out of curiosity, is this something like what you need?  http://jsfiddle.net/tbbgkwem/
[11:12:00] <robertmaxrees> monk3y that defeats the point of the channel :)
[11:12:13] <robertmaxrees> and that's closer, but still doesn't work.
[11:12:18] <monk3y> o_O?  Lurking .. or apologising for lurking? ;)
[11:12:37] <robertmaxrees> doing the work for the person asking the question :)
[11:12:48] <monk3y> Oh d'oh!  Sorry!
[11:12:52] <monk3y> You're right.
[11:13:06] <robertmaxrees> :) not a big deal.
[11:13:13] <robertmaxrees> still some things to fix there anyway.
[11:13:20] <robertmaxrees> .href() isn't a function, for instance.
[11:13:21] <monk3y> No wait.  I *purrrrposely* wrote it so it doesn't work.  That's an exercise for the reader.  Etc.
[11:13:24] <monk3y> (hehe)
[11:13:35] <taplar> silly monkey
[11:14:25] * Uhkis hands monk3y a banana
[11:14:33] <monk3y> Oh didn't even look at the href nonsense.  The answer to that is $().prop- . .. waait.  I won't do it again.
[11:14:43] <islalobo> monk3y: robertmaxrees I don't see a difference between what the two of you posted? But that is working better. If I wanted to get the value of any given input (from that array of inputs) would it be something like $('input[name="clinics"]').val();
[11:14:43] <robertmaxrees> prop() is actually wrong in this case.
[11:14:59] <robertmaxrees> islalobo first off, it's not "an array of inputs"
[11:15:01] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.
[11:15:13] <robertmaxrees> second off, you don't want that - you want to use the change event instead.
[11:15:20] <robertmaxrees> then just grab the value of the current one.
[11:17:00] <monk3y> Prop is wrong?  Whaaa?  I thought attr() would get the initial value on-render, but .prop is for setting or getting thereafter..
[11:17:00] <monk3y> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179713/how-to-change-the-href-for-a-hyperlink-using-jquery
[11:17:22] <monk3y> Stop me if I'm solving more of the homework than I should :/
[11:17:40] <robertmaxrees> not accurate at all.
[11:17:49] <monk3y> Oh noes!
[11:17:53] <robertmaxrees> either way, .attr() is more appropriate in this case.
[11:18:02] * monk3y shift-deletes everything he's learned
[11:18:26] <robertmaxrees> check out how browsers return different values for .prop('href') and .attr('href') for relative urls.
[11:19:54] <monk3y> Oh that could be a kicker.
[11:20:07] <islalobo> http://jsfiddle.net/z492b657/5/
[11:20:20] <robertmaxrees> close.  but elem isn't set there, islalobo
[11:20:23] <islalobo> Wait, that still has elem…
[11:21:12] <islalobo> robertmaxrees:  is it $this.val() that I want/
[11:21:15] <islalobo> *want?
[11:21:22] <robertmaxrees> $this isn't anything until you define it.
[11:21:27] <robertmaxrees> $(this), on the other hand...
[11:23:05] <monk3y> When you bind to $(input[type='radio']).change(), will that fire just for the one that's selected - or for both the new one selected, and the old one deselected?
[11:23:14] <robertmaxrees> the new one.
[11:23:35] <islalobo> http://jsfiddle.net/z492b657/8/
[11:24:12] <robertmaxrees> islalobo that should work :)
[11:24:20] <islalobo> robertmaxrees++
[11:24:22] <robertmaxrees> monk3y that is to say, just once.
[11:24:30] <islalobo> monk3y++
[11:25:04] <monk3y> I just got incremented and I know not what my score is.
[11:25:15] <islalobo> Thank you for helping and thank you for not feeding me the answer :)
[11:25:22] <robertmaxrees> :) that's how we roll here.
[11:37:00] <islalobo> Now if I could just get it to work in drupal
[11:37:11] <robertmaxrees> what part of it doesn't work?
[11:37:43] <islalobo> setting the attr()
[11:38:01] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[11:38:05] <robertmaxrees> because that should work just fine.
[11:40:49] <islalobo> No errors when I look in firebug
[11:41:02] <robertmaxrees> then you're probably not selecting the right element.
[11:41:10] <robertmaxrees> because the fiddle works :)
[11:41:49] <robertmaxrees> if you pop a console log in there, does it work?
[11:46:27] <mazpe> how can i trigger from data-toggle="modal" and data-target="#myModal" from inside a jquery function. $('.avatarCropper').click(function(e){ });
[11:46:51] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[11:47:07] <sadmicrowave> I was about to say the same thing
[11:47:13] <mazpe> lol
[11:47:20] <mazpe> yeah after i wrote it.. iwas like uhm..
[11:47:23] <mazpe> let me jfiddle
[11:47:35] <robertmaxrees> yaaaaaaaay
[11:50:09] <jeffreylevesque> ran http://jsfiddle.net/davidThomas/eHNJg/ on https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json, and received "undefined  undefined" in console
[11:50:18] <jeffreylevesque> how is the json file "undefined"?
[11:51:14] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to find out what you mean by "pop a console log in there"
[11:51:38] <robertmaxrees> console.log('foo'); as the first thing in the event handler, islalobo
[11:52:13] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque try console.log(e.originalEvent.target.files) first - see what's up there first.
[11:53:50] <jeffreylevesque> console log says "FileList [ File ]"
[11:54:00] <jeffreylevesque> it has an attribute of `length:1`

[11:54:40] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[11:54:42] <furoido> any particular jquery to use for form validation?
[11:54:45] <jeffreylevesque> lastModified: 1441632072772
[11:54:56] <furoido> like i just add class when example required fields
[11:55:06] <robertmaxrees> furoido there's jquery validate.
[11:55:19] <robertmaxrees> requires a little mor effort than that but otherwise should fit the bill.
[11:56:14] <robhol> ideas for debugging "$(...).nextUntil is not a function" ? I'm using the same expression in the firebug console and it works THERE :|
[11:57:23] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: the fiddle i'm using doesn't suffice?
[11:57:39] <robhol> and it's clearly a jquery object since .text() on the preceding line succeeds.
[11:59:55] <robhol> ... oh, I might be using an outdated jquery
[12:00:11] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque so i should get the error in the console there?
[12:00:23] <jeffreylevesque> i hope so
[12:01:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing fileName or fileSize properties available.
[12:01:51] <robertmaxrees> that's where you're getting undefineds from.
[12:03:17] <mazpe> ok lets hope that this makes sense.
[12:03:18] <mazpe> https://jsfiddle.net/geuv3nnc/2/
[12:03:23] <mazpe> its the cropper.js
[12:03:32] <jeffreylevesque> i added the line you suggested - http://jsfiddle.net/jeff1evesque/e4fp18z9/1/
[12:03:42] <robertmaxrees> and what do you notice?
[12:03:48] <mazpe> Right now i'm able to get to work by a link that has data-toggle and data-target
[12:04:06] <mazpe> but i need to get it running with the code starting in line 24
[12:04:26] <mazpe> which will upload the image first.. then init the modal with cropper.js inside.
[12:04:27] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e4fp18z9/2/
[12:04:46] <mazpe> but it doesnt work from inside $('#avatarfileupload').fileupload()
[12:04:55] <robertmaxrees> mazpe what doesn't?
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> all of this?
[12:05:06] <robertmaxrees> a particular part of it?
[12:05:17] <mazpe> the $('#cropper-example-2-modal').on('shown.bs.modal', function () { }
[12:05:19] <jeffreylevesque> yup the `type` attribute is empty `""`
[12:05:19] <mazpe> that part.
[12:05:27] <robertmaxrees> mazpe use a delegated listener instead.
[12:05:33] <mazpe> a whaaaat?
[12:05:34] <robertmaxrees> also, $image will likely change for the new ones.
[12:05:34] <mazpe> lol
[12:05:58] <robertmaxrees> your element doesn't exist on pageload it sounds like.
[12:06:10] <robertmaxrees> what's a parent element that exists on pageload?
[12:06:21] <robertmaxrees> because something like $(document).on('shown.bs.modal
[12:06:50] <robertmaxrees> err, $(document).on('shown.bs.modal', '#cropper-example-2-modal', function () {
[12:07:09] <mazpe> let me try that..
[12:07:18] <mazpe> so its got nothing to do with the data-*
[12:07:20] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque there are also no fileName or fileType properties
[12:08:35] <jeffreylevesque> what's wrong with this json file?
[12:08:52] <robertmaxrees> nothing.  those aren't the names of the properties you're looking for.
[12:09:29] <jeffreylevesque> i need the mimetype
[12:10:00] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: oh yeah i forgot to put var $image = $('#cropper-example-2 > img'); in the jsfiddle also
[12:10:22] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque ...
[12:10:33] <robertmaxrees> it's either application/json or  	application/octet-stream
[12:10:55] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, hey, ive changed the whole code, http://paste.ofcode.org/hKNYYEE6L4xL2EWrJzBcfe
[12:11:15] <jeffreylevesque> my 'jquery-validate' plugin doesn't detect those options when i upload https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json
[12:11:25] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, Is there a way to extend the '+' button trhough the rows of the form?
[12:11:33] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque i really don't understand what's so difficult here.
[12:11:57] <robertmaxrees> have you set jquery validate to recognize the right mime type.
[12:12:16] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb you don't need data-id in there.
[12:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you could have just real the value of the button.
[12:12:27] <robertmaxrees> *read
[12:12:49] <robertmaxrees> and i'm not sure what you mean by "extend the '+' button"
[12:13:04] <jeffreylevesque> robertmaxrees: yes, i've added those two options last night (did not commit though) to my array of acceptable mimetypes, https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/form_validator.js#L83.  When i uploaded the json file, https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/web_interface/static/data/json/sample.json it said not valid
[12:13:13] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque make a jsfiddle with your code.
[12:13:16] <robertmaxrees> show us what you have.
[12:13:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise we're not going to get anywhere.
[12:14:20] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, make it bigger
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb that's a css question.
[12:14:41] <robertmaxrees> also avoid eval()
[12:18:40] <marcelofb> robertmaxrees, why?
[12:19:08] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/geuv3nnc/3/
[12:19:20] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: line 40 $(document).on('shown.bs.modal', '#cropper-example-2-modal', function ()
[12:19:24] <mazpe> didnt work either.
[12:19:36] <mazpe> the upload happens... then nada
[12:19:53] <mazpe> no errors on the shown.bs.modal nada.
[12:35:53] <robertmaxrees> mazpe something here isn't adding up.  are you wanting something to happen when the modal opens, or when the image uploads?
[12:36:24] <robertmaxrees> marcelofb https://jslinterrors.com/eval-is-evil
[12:38:12] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: when the image uploads.. i the model to open up.
[12:38:27] <mazpe> just like if i've clicked in the <a href="#" class="btn btn-lg btn-success"  data-toggle="modal"  data-target="#cropper-example-2-modal">Click to open Modal</a>
[12:38:35] <islalobo> Hello, I'm having issues trying to debug my jquery (we're using drupal)
[12:38:39] <arc_> sorry, shown.bs.modal is an event?
[12:38:49] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:38:54] <robertmaxrees> i didn't catch that part before.
[12:39:01] <robertmaxrees> that he wanted it after it uploaded.
[12:39:18] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: thats why i have it inside the .on('fileuploaddone',function(e,data) { }
[12:39:22] <mazpe> );
[12:39:28] <robertmaxrees> you don't want the .on() in there.
[12:39:37] <mazpe> ok
[12:39:37] <robertmaxrees> and http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals-methods
[12:39:42] <robertmaxrees> the .on() should be outside of that.
[12:40:05] <hlvwrk> ermm
[12:40:08] * hlvwrk licks robertmaxrees 
[12:40:37] <robertmaxrees> mazpe look at that link - you want .modal('show')
[12:41:35] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: let me try
[12:43:58] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: yes that loaded! no copper.js but ill see why not.
[12:44:02] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: but yes!
[12:45:03] <YamakasY> ok, I have some weird issue, I get this error "TypeError: $.datepicker is undefined" but everything is loaded which should be normally... any idea where I need to debug this ? I'm not getting why it should not be defined
[12:45:22] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY make sure your code is after you load datepicker
[12:45:53] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah, ok will move it
[12:49:02] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/Lk29nxzn/ I can't figure out what am I doing wrong here? see console.  I can't figure out how to progress() with notifyWith()
[12:52:47] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.notifyWith/ -> args is an array.
[12:52:57] <shoky_> ngharo: second argument to notifyWith needs to be an array of arguments
[12:52:58] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: fixed, there was some extra jquery loaded again after it :D
[12:53:02] <shoky_> oops
[12:53:05] <robertmaxrees> :D
[12:53:13] <YamakasY> so I need to kiss you
[12:53:16] <ngharo> robertmaxrees, shoky_: >_> thank you!
[12:53:21] * YamakasY spreads his arms
[12:54:26] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: ok.. getting there.. https://jsfiddle.net/geuv3nnc/5/ run it and click on Cropper Modal.. it opens the modal but the cropper doesnt load/show
[12:54:50] <islalobo> robertmaxrees: with the off chance that you might have insight into this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/be210cb033f3408b83aa This is the form, ajax callback, js and template I'm using (where the js you suggested to me isn't working)
[12:55:17] <robertmaxrees> mazpe you probably need to run the cropper init when the modal shows?
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> dunno.
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> isaacdurazo does that console.log() work though?
[12:56:15] <robertmaxrees> err, islalobo
[12:56:31] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: i did.
[12:58:32] <robertmaxrees> mazpe you're confused again.
[12:58:46] <robertmaxrees> $('#cropper-example-2-modal').modal('show') is how you show it./
[12:58:59] <robertmaxrees> you still need the event binding separate from the for the cropper stuff.
[12:59:17] <Jm4kdi> hello
[12:59:26] <Jm4kdi> how do you compare something to a string in js?
[12:59:39] <robertmaxrees> by using ===
[13:00:44] <robertmaxrees> mazpe .telefonica.de) has joined #jquery

[13:00:46] <robertmaxrees> woops
[13:00:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/geuv3nnc/6/
[13:01:24] <Jm4kdi> thanks robertmaxrees
[13:01:35] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: uh huh!!!
[13:02:11] <islalobo> Does anyone know any tricks for debugging jquery in drupal? My javascript isn't working in our drupal instance
[13:02:21] <blik71> hey can someone let me know what I'm doing wrong with this script, I wanted to toggle a css class using jquery, but I just can't get it to work. Much help appreciated!! JSFiddle -> https://jsfiddle.net/euz55d4x/
[13:02:29] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com islalobo
[13:02:34] <robertmaxrees> the drupal part is irrelevant fwiw.
[13:02:41] <robertmaxrees> jquery only cares about the html that gets rendered.
[13:03:04] <robertmaxrees> blik71 huh?
[13:03:10] <robertmaxrees> what are you expecting to happen here?
[13:03:17] <mazpe> robertmaxrees:  yes yes yes you the man
[13:03:34] <mazpe> robertmaxrees: error number one was trying to do it inside he .on('fileuploaddone')
[13:03:40] <mazpe> do it outside... and .show from .on
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> blik71 also, don't use onclick./
[13:05:36] <blik71> so right now i'm testing it on the element "H". When I click the element I would like the element to change color to show that its been selected. I made a class called activated that is a subclass of main in the css sheet
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/euz55d4x/4/
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> blik71 use .on('click', function() {});
[13:06:09] <robertmaxrees> and no need for a plugin here.
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> also, it's .addClass('activated'); - no period in front.
[13:07:22] <NoiseEee> blik71: https://jsfiddle.net/euz55d4x/5/
[13:07:49] <robertmaxrees> woops - meant to do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/euz55d4x/6/
[13:07:53] <robertmaxrees> NoiseEee had it.
[13:08:48] <blik71> ahhh thank you, so u need the '.' syntax where exactly, because I think thats what was confusing me, because I tried something like that earlier
[13:08:59] <blik71> *when not where
[13:09:03] <arc_> . turns a string into a selector for a class
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> when selecting elements via classname.
[13:09:11] <arc_> but you aren't selecting anything when you use addClass()
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> so $('.className')
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> but addClass() just wants a string - $('.someThing').addClass('className');
[13:10:04] <blik71> ahh okay thank you :D!
[13:11:09] <blik71> also real quick is there any way to resize a pop window in order to fit the content?
[13:19:59] <YamakasY> odd question maybe but is it a good idea to load js script only when you need them ? like after a login ?
[13:20:16] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you want to do it and what your needs are.
[13:20:28] <robertmaxrees> i'd try to concatenate things and load them that way instead.
[13:23:40] <YamakasY> yeah I get some issues with that same timepicker when (my script is not finshed yet) it comes back on the page after the submit... but my datepicker is still loaded as first
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:24:25] <YamakasY> yes
[13:24:28] <YamakasY> dunno why it happens
[13:24:33] <robertmaxrees> that sentence doesn't make sense.
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm confused.
[13:25:29] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: what don't you get ?
[13:25:35] <YamakasY> I just post to the same /
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> the whole sentence.
[13:25:43] <YamakasY> yeah
[13:25:45] <YamakasY> can be
[13:25:49] <YamakasY> getting tired
[13:26:12] <YamakasY> so, I load my page, no issue
[13:26:34] <YamakasY> I post to this same page and than it gets the datepicker error on 4 fields I see
[13:26:40] <YamakasY> it kinda loops or so
[13:26:53] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading the datepickers?
[13:27:38] <YamakasY> using a js file and on top of it init that function
[13:27:53] <robertmaxrees> is it via ajax oorr...
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> (you're not giving me nearly enough information right now - try sharing your code)
[13:28:06] <YamakasY> oh, now you are asking me something :)
[13:28:22] <YamakasY> yeah it's 2000 lines this library, don't wanna do that for you
[13:28:53] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole thing.
[13:28:59] <robertmaxrees> just the specifics relevant to what you're doing.
[13:30:48] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: just posting to this page, nothing more
[13:30:59] <robertmaxrees> no idea what your js looks like so i can't really help.
[13:31:00] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[13:32:33] <YamakasY> hehe, no you can't I know, just collaborating, it keeps loading and loading and that datepicker error comes by multiple times after the submit :S
[13:32:52] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're not loading the datepicker lib then.
[13:36:10] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I am :)
[13:40:00] <Es0teric> how do i detect if a collection of divs is hidden or not?
[13:41:38] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: is it possible for you to see how i can make this json which is pickedup by my script ? http://pastebin.com/d9Ebptp3
[13:41:52] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:42:16] <YamakasY> yes the secipt parses an error message like that
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY not making sense again.
[13:42:28] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric $(element).is(":visible");
[13:44:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees would i just get that collection first
[13:44:33] <Es0teric> then check if is visible?
[13:44:47] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric huh?  do you want to know if all elements in a collection are visible?
[13:45:15] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees well i am trying to check if one of the elements are visible in the collection
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if ANY are visible?
[13:46:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah
[13:47:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/is/
[13:50:54] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes yes ye s! I'm getting somewhere :D
[13:51:09] <YamakasY> I need to die() my php
[13:51:16] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so use .is(':visible')
[13:51:21] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY are you doing something with ajax?
[13:51:25] <Es0teric> gotcha, thanks robertmaxrees
[13:51:28] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:51:53] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I'm devving something agains master great devved stuff, but I'm more the basic programmer if needed and do all the cluster config :D
[13:52:01] <YamakasY> but I never giveup
[13:55:36] <YamakasY> but now I need to get my data into that table
[13:55:42] <YamakasY> to show it
[13:56:37] <robertmaxrees> are you ajaxing the entire page over?
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> because you should ajax just the data.
[13:56:56] <YamakasY> yes I do
[13:56:58] <YamakasY> only the daya
[13:56:59] <YamakasY> data
[13:58:12] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: what I just pastebinned you was what I get as response on a working page
[13:58:24] <YamakasY> but I need to p00p it in my own creature
[13:58:27] <NitroLiq> Has anyone experienced a scenario using jquery-ui where during an animation (i.e., slide in/out), during the slide, certain styles are being overridden?
[13:58:49] <YamakasY> NitroLiq: depends
[13:59:04] <NitroLiq> I have the slide working fine in codepen.
[13:59:07] <YamakasY> NitroLiq: check if you don't load a custom jquery lib which does that
[13:59:46] <NitroLiq> But adding to my project, the border and bottom padding are being overridden until the end of the trnaition
[13:59:49] <NitroLiq> transition
[14:00:07] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i don't understand what you're asking.
[14:00:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do with that data?
[14:00:16] <NitroLiq> I'm just using the full jquery-ui via bower
[14:00:33] <YamakasY> parse it in my inhidden block
[14:00:58] <robertmaxrees> then parse it?
[14:19:50] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I did it !!!
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> great.
[14:19:55] <robertmaxrees> congrats.
[14:20:02] <YamakasY> thanks!
[14:20:08] <YamakasY> we need to kiss again
[14:20:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:20:13] <robertmaxrees> nah i'm good ;)
[14:20:19] <YamakasY> I make you better
[14:20:26] <YamakasY> close your eyes and spread your arms :D
[14:20:46] <YamakasY> json is so kewl
[14:20:55] <robertmaxrees> it's convenient.
[14:21:27] <YamakasY> yeah
[14:21:41] <YamakasY> I used it before but I wanted to use these libraries we always use
[14:24:14] <blik71> how could u get the tag attribute of an element being referenced in a jquery script?
[14:24:23] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[14:24:38] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: m ?
[14:24:40] <YamakasY> me ?
[14:24:47] <robertmaxrees> at blik71
[14:26:24] <blik71> I've assigned a tag attribute to each element in my periodic table and I want to get the name of that element when its selected. Is there a method in jquery that can return the tag attribute of an html element?
[14:26:34] <robertmaxrees> "a tag attribute" doesn't make sense.
[14:26:43] <robertmaxrees> html has tags.
[14:26:48] <robertmaxrees> those tags can have attributes.
[14:27:11] <blik71> theres an attribute called tag though
[14:27:22] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you mean?
[14:30:30] <blik71> nvm I was looking at the wrong reference, but is there a name attribute or anything like that or can you only use id?
[14:30:41] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[14:30:44] <robertmaxrees> selecting elements?>
[14:30:51] <robertmaxrees> or storing data on elements?
[14:31:34] <blik71> selecting elements so I can send the elements selected and the relevant info to a php file
[14:31:43] <blik71> i'll be back in 15 mins
[14:31:50] <robertmaxrees> you can use ids and classes.
[14:37:00] <Guest1000000> What would be a good looking alternative to bootstrap ?
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> Guest1000000 semantic ui is one choice.  foundation is another.
[14:47:22] <claytonzaugg> How can I traverse the entire dom, count how many of a certain class are there, and get that total?
[14:47:33] <robertmaxrees> $('.theCLass').length
[14:48:04] <claytonzaugg> Seriously robertmaxrees, that's it? It'll tell mehow many times it's present?!
[14:48:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:48:38] <claytonzaugg> Holy crap... okay thanks!  I'll try and do the next part after that on my own before crawling back for help :)
[14:48:49] <robertmaxrees> haha what do you have?
[14:50:45] <claytonzaugg> well
[14:51:19] <claytonzaugg> okay, basically I need to assign an id to each of these checkboxes throughout my file and then assign a number to it, and the same number to the for part of the label
[14:51:25] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:51:29] <claytonzaugg> $('.switch-settings div.switch').append('<input id="toggle-switch" class="toggle toggle-round-flat" type="checkbox"><label for="toggle-switch"></label>');
[14:52:01] <claytonzaugg> because for some reason, I can't just put this in and it works, whatever code is pre-existing, it's not letting the checkboxes run
[14:52:08] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[14:52:11] <claytonzaugg> I have to assign each thing separately named
[14:52:14] <claytonzaugg> okay one sec
[14:53:28] <claytonzaugg> actually here, here's the example I got the code from
[14:53:29] <claytonzaugg> http://callmenick.com/_development/css-toggle-switch/
[14:53:40] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle either way ;)
[14:53:43] <claytonzaugg> the 4th, 5th, and 6th items down
[14:53:45] <claytonzaugg> okay one sec
[14:56:30] <claytonzaugg> okay forget formatting, the issue of each box performing the action still remains
[14:56:31] <claytonzaugg> http://jsfiddle.net/ahadbsr8/
[14:56:37] <mentoc> is there a way to create your own event in javascript and then bind to that event with a name via $("myEle").bind ?
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> mentoc you use .on(), and yes.
[14:57:16] <robertmaxrees> just use .trigger('myEvent')
[14:57:25] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, if you change the id of one of them, as well as the "for=" of that changed id to equal it, they BOTH work
[14:57:54] <robertmaxrees> oh you have to leave the label after the input.
[14:57:55] <robertmaxrees> laaaame.
[14:58:17] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing this client-side btw?
[14:59:20] <claytonzaugg> The ENTIRE reason this is happening is because this code I was given has a ton of images of this exact thing for on off, they just change out the image.  I'm trying to cut down on the requests considerably and clean up the JS heavy code.
[14:59:38] <robertmaxrees> then make it less js-heavy.  do this server-siude.
[14:59:39] <robertmaxrees> *side
[14:59:57] <claytonzaugg> can you give me an example or explain further?
[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean...
[15:00:16] <robertmaxrees> you do it in whatever server-side language you have now.
[15:00:22] <robertmaxrees> instead of using javascript.
[15:00:29] <claytonzaugg> Oh
[15:01:18] <claytonzaugg> never mind, okay, yeah no this is all client side.  It's an emulator of a panel our company uses, and this third party company created the entire thing in javascript, jquery, html, css, etc
[15:01:33] <robertmaxrees> right, why does it have to be client-side though?
[15:01:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:02:09] <claytonzaugg> Well... we're running twig
[15:02:18] <claytonzaugg> I never touch backend
[15:02:27] <robertmaxrees> you should in this case.
[15:02:43] <claytonzaugg> If that weren
[15:02:47] <claytonzaugg> t an option?
[15:02:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:03:12] <robertmaxrees> then create jquery objects that you can clone and edit.
[15:03:22] <robertmaxrees> .each() passes an index as the first argument to the callback.
[15:03:26] <robertmaxrees> so use that.
[15:04:49] <claytonzaugg> Okay, so is it possible then to get the list of how many times I have <section class="switch-settings"><div class="switch"></div></section> and each one would be a number in the index, so when I for eached over it, it would apply whatever changes I made to each in order?
[15:04:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:05:01] <claytonzaugg> lol
[15:05:05] <robertmaxrees> you're not using for each.
[15:05:18] <claytonzaugg> no for each, just a for loop
[15:05:23] <claytonzaugg> sorry
[15:05:24] <robertmaxrees> no for
[15:05:33] <robertmaxrees> you use the jquery each.
[15:05:37] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:05:42] <claytonzaugg> ...okay, haven't used that before
[15:05:47] <robertmaxrees> something like http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ahadbsr8/2/
[15:06:30] <claytonzaugg> okay reading tgrough api, then your code, be back in a minute
[15:06:50] <robertmaxrees> you should check out learn.jquery.com
[15:07:30] <claytonzaugg> Maybe I'll give that a try then, I know enough to be dangerous with jquery, but learning a lot of syntax that others use daily is where the challenge comes
[15:07:47] <robertmaxrees> syntax isn't your issue.
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> that's a javascript thing.
[15:08:02] <robertmaxrees> it's knowing the methods available.
[15:08:08] <claytonzaugg> fair
[15:10:57] <claytonzaugg> well the update you did works perfectly, so first thank you for that.  Second, will going through learn.jquery.com provide info on all the most used functions / methods available?
[15:11:08] <robertmaxrees> a lot of them, yes.
[15:11:14] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot of basics you don't know.
[15:11:16] <robertmaxrees> like .each()
[15:11:38] <claytonzaugg> Cool, then that's where I'll start.  You're correct, I just haven't had the need yet to learn that until now.
[15:11:47] <claytonzaugg> Been out of college for three months :)
[15:12:00] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.  this'll all be good stuff for you to start learning then.
[15:12:15] <claytonzaugg> Not that I don't know anything mind you, just so much I had to learn, I never got a depth, just a breadth to what I did learn
[15:12:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:13:09] <robertmaxrees> we have a lot of jr devs fresh out of college and interns that just don't have the knowledge that comes with experience.
[15:13:19] <claytonzaugg> So if I may ask, do you work for the jQuery foundation?
[15:13:25] <robertmaxrees> haha, nah.
[15:13:40] <robertmaxrees> i work for a medium-large ecommerce company.
[15:13:47] <claytonzaugg> Just a lot of experience that you're passing on... you're awesome and I am grateful for all your help!
[15:13:55] <robertmaxrees> absolutely - happy to help.
[15:14:00] <claytonzaugg> You've helped me quite a few times already lol
[15:14:37] <claytonzaugg> Well, back to integration then! Talk with you more later I bet :)
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[15:18:11] <printForever> is anyone up?
[15:18:21] <printForever> I haz a question
[15:18:26] <robertmaxrees> just ask it then.
[15:18:36] <printForever> hi Robert
[15:19:31] <printForever> I have a list of items (ordinary UL LI list) and I want to show EACH LI after 1 click on a button (anchor outside the UL)
[15:19:47] <robertmaxrees> all of the lis?
[15:19:52] <printForever> 1 by 1
[15:19:59] <printForever> and only after click
[15:20:02] <robertmaxrees> okay.  where are you lost?
[15:20:04] <printForever> so 1 click 1 LI
[15:20:15] <printForever> well, I don't know how to stop the script after 1 LI
[15:20:21] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:20:23] <printForever> I either show all of them or none
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've got so far.
[15:20:26] <printForever> ok
[15:21:25] <printForever> is fiddle down?
[15:21:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:21:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:21:35] <printForever> oh, it loaded now
[15:21:36] <robertmaxrees> works for me.
[15:22:30] <printForever> mm... really slow for me
[15:23:24] <printForever> why doesn't Fiddle have autocomplete already...
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> it does for markup.
[15:26:26] <Jm4kdi> if i have $('#form').on('submit', function(e, X) {} if i trigger this would it have to be ('#form').trigger('submit', e, X)???
[15:26:37] <Jm4kdi> how do i correctly trigger submit in this example
[15:26:39] <robertmaxrees> Jm4kdi you can't pass two args like that.
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> only the event gets passed.
[15:26:51] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/d4azgrav/
[15:26:58] <robertmaxrees> otherwise it's .trigger('submit');
[15:27:16] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's targeting the UL.
[15:27:18] <robertmaxrees> not each LI
[15:27:46] <printForever> robertmaxrees: yeah... I reverted back to the old code... I didn't know how to go through the LI's
[15:27:46] <Jm4kdi> i want to pass X how do i do that? e is event
[15:27:52] <robertmaxrees> Jm4kdi you can't.
[15:28:24] <printForever> robertmaxrees: if I did each, it would just loop through them and I will show all of them again
[15:28:49] <robertmaxrees> printForever you don't use each.
[15:28:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kd4vp3tk/
[15:28:59] <robertmaxrees> you do something like this.
[15:29:09] <printForever> robertmaxrees: I thought maybe to select :first of .mydiv and then toggle it and remove .mydiv class
[15:29:25] <printForever> so the next hidden :first would have .mydiv
[15:29:26] <robertmaxrees> :first will always reference the same element.
[15:29:36] <printForever> .mydiv:first
[15:29:36] <robertmaxrees> so you don't want that - look at my fiddle for some inspiration.
[15:29:43] <printForever> ok
[15:29:52] <robertmaxrees> :first will get the first element, regardless of whether or not it's visible.
[15:29:59] <Jm4kdi> how would i stop default of submit without including e here??  $('#form').on('submit', function(e, X) {}  is it $(this).prev....... within the function??
[15:30:07] <robertmaxrees> Jm4kdi you don't pass args to event handlers.  that's now how that works.
[15:30:28] <robertmaxrees> the event object is passed for you.
[15:30:50] <robertmaxrees> $('#form').on('submit', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[15:30:53] <toothe> so, turns out Chromium OS LSM is preventing this.
[15:30:56] <toothe> I don't know what that is.
[15:31:02] <robertmaxrees> toothe preventing what?
[15:31:15] <printForever> robertmaxrees: why have you taken "li" outside and created a VAR out of it?
[15:31:17] <toothe> loading the kernel module.
[15:31:29] <robertmaxrees> toothe wrong channel?
[15:31:34] <robertmaxrees> printForever literally no reason to reselect it.
[15:31:41] <robertmaxrees> select once outside of the handler.
[15:32:12] <Jm4kdi> what if i want to check X $('#form').on('submit', function(e, X) {}  what do i need to use to allow that. onsubmit? submit()?
[15:32:17] <printForever> when I see it like this it looks plain and simple robertmaxrees
[15:32:18] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[15:32:28] <robertmaxrees> Jm4kdi you cannot pass an extra arg to your event handler.
[15:32:40] <robertmaxrees> at least not without hacking it in - that's a bad design pattern.  what are you trying to pass?
[15:32:42] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:34:26] <Jm4kdi> check if x is true before submitting form check ON form submit.
[15:34:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's now how that works.
[15:34:40] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[15:38:38] <Daz43> hey, would anyone here be able to give me some advice on a fiddle? Modal wont autosize :S
[15:38:50] <robertmaxrees> Daz43 just ask the channel.
[15:38:56] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:40:40] <Daz43> cool here's a link -> https://jsfiddle.net/cysfd6pj/embedded/result/
[15:42:07] <Daz43> I've tried things like, width:auto and autosize:true within the js and restricting the size with css but it keeps breaking something :(
[15:42:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:42:51] <robertmaxrees> oh, you want the modal the same size as the image?
[15:44:19] <Daz43> yea :)
[15:44:57] <robertmaxrees> lots of google results.
[15:46:39] <Daz43> what are you searching for?
[15:46:44] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap size modal to content
[15:47:00] <robertmaxrees> also - .modal-dialog
[15:47:05] <robertmaxrees> set your width to that and you're done.
[15:51:37] <Daz43> I've tried setting a max-width to .modal-dialog but then it's not centralised :(
[15:51:45] <Daz43> thanks for the help btw
[16:00:32] <toothe> is there a website where I can post snippets of HTML/CSS/JS? I've used it before...
[16:02:08] <printForever> tnx robertmaxrees
[16:02:41] <toothe> jsfiddle!
[16:05:15] <robertmaxrees> aaaand back
[16:05:34] <robertmaxrees> Daz43 are the images dynamically sized?  or will they always be 400px wide?
[16:05:36] <toothe> anyone know how to do something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/uswxpebf/
[16:05:52] <toothe> specifically, how do i make it sot hat everything in the second list is automatically "selected" when I hit a submit button?
[16:06:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:04] <toothe> let me take a step back
[16:06:17] <toothe> I have two lists, one with "potential" values, and the other with "selected" values.
[16:06:19] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/uswxpebf/1/
[16:06:41] <robertmaxrees> use jsfiddle to load jquery.
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> and are you doing a get or a post?
[16:06:51] <toothe> excuse me.
[16:06:54] <toothe> POST
[16:07:11] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  just build the body manually.
[16:07:19] <toothe> so, I think I could probably figure outt he jquery to have elements added to the right list.
[16:07:23] <toothe> THat shoudln't be too difficult.
[16:07:57] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to stop the default submit and manually build the post object yourself.
[16:08:09] <toothe> But, when I hit submit, how do I make it so that everything in the right column is submitted in the POST request, and not just the....oh....
[16:08:12] <toothe> hm...
[16:08:24] <toothe> and that'st he standard way of doing it?
[16:08:45] <robertmaxrees> that's the way that comes to mind that makes the most sense.
[16:08:56] <toothe> does this have a name? It seems like a standard widget format.
[16:09:51] <Daz43> sorry cat brought in a rat
[16:10:07] <Daz43> the images will be a set size of 400px
[16:10:21] <robertmaxrees> Daz43 then just set that width via your css.
[16:10:51] <toothe> robertmaxrees: Does this widget have a name? I'd like to see some other examples if any
[16:11:11] <robertmaxrees> toothe not that i can think of.  search around on google.
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> you might come up with something.
[16:11:16] <toothe> yeah, working on it.
[16:11:25] <toothe> actually, im absolutely certain i've seen this before...
[16:11:31] <robertmaxrees> you probably have.
[16:12:10] <Daz43> I've tried setting it in the css but it breaks the centering of the modal, tried setting it dynamically aswel :(
[16:12:21] <robertmaxrees> fiddle link again Daz43
[16:12:53] <toothe> robertmaxrees: perhaps rather than building out the POST request manually, I could insert into a HIDDEN field.
[16:12:57] <toothe> how does that sound?
[16:13:08] <claytonzaugg> robertmaxrees, just finished integrating the code you helped me with and replacing all the images.  Thanks again!
[16:14:07] <Daz43> https://jsfiddle.net/cysfd6pj/embedded/result/
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> toothe i'd prefer building out the body myself.
[16:14:23] <robertmaxrees> but meh.
[16:14:29] <toothe> robertmaxrees: Really? isn't tha tmore work?
[16:14:39] <robertmaxrees> i like having that kind of control.
[16:14:59] <toothe> fair.
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/cysfd6pj/2/ Daz43
[16:17:35] <Daz43> i feel stupid
[16:17:44] <Daz43> thank you
[16:17:55] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good mang.
[16:21:36] <toothe> im gonna figure out how to do this and put it on the internet for free.
[16:22:51] <robertmaxrees> i mean... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1058517/jquery-moving-multiselect-values-to-another-multiselect
[16:23:12] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices out there.
[16:23:24] <robertmaxrees> though usually this isn't what you want.
[16:23:39] <robertmaxrees> the control is confusing and can be hard for end users to understand.
[16:29:30] <toothe> robertmaxrees: let me try this
[16:29:57] <toothe> yeah, i mean Google is great, but the issue is that you have to know exactly what keywords you want
[16:30:01] <toothe> like...i don't know what this is called.
[16:30:02] <toothe> if any.
[16:30:04] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:30:11] <robertmaxrees> i just searched around and found that so post.
[16:30:19] <toothe> cuz you used the right keywords :-)
[16:30:32] <toothe> i think i did too, but i didn't find that particular post.
[16:30:47] <robertmaxrees> javascript move between selects
[16:30:48] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[16:31:03] <toothe> i searched "multiple lists widget"
[16:31:24] <robertmaxrees> you need "javascript" or "jquery" in there usually.
[16:31:32] <robertmaxrees> and it's not a widget necessarily.
[16:32:41] <robertmaxrees> i'd really suggest rethinking this pattern though.
[16:32:46] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason it's not super common.
[17:25:20] <triceX34> can anyone hep out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32468802/plupload-where-do-you-handle-what-is-returned-from-php?noredirect=1#comment52799604_32468802

[17:52:50] <jeffreylevesque> could anyone assist me with https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/2081#issuecomment-138741936
[18:04:00] <nodist> jefferylevesque Im looking at it now
[18:11:45] <nodist> jefferylevesque https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/type
[18:13:02] <nodist> You might have to do the determination on the server, my chrome is blank but my firefox does see it as application/json
[18:15:10] <jeffreylevesque> nodist: i mean it's javascript, on the client side.  Is it necessary to configure the server?
[18:16:15] <nodist> in my firefox it sees the type but on my chrome it does not, depending on your users you may have to
[18:18:15] <jeffreylevesque> it doesnt for any broswers for me :(
[18:19:00] <nodist> im running ff 40.0.3 and it works, Im upgrading chrome and I'll check again, im also running it on ubuntu
[18:20:19] <nodist> but yeah, if your going for a general user base who you can't tell which broswer to use your gonna have to set somthing up on the server to do the detection for json and possibly other types
[18:21:52] <jeffreylevesque> i probably shouldn't check on client side then?
[18:21:57] <jeffreylevesque> i'm on windows host
[18:22:03] <jeffreylevesque> the virtual machine is ubuntu
[18:22:09] <jeffreylevesque> vm port forwards to windows
[18:22:16] <jeffreylevesque> so i guess it depends on the windows os?
[18:24:12] <nodist> yeah, I would check on the server if your running the lastest versions and it dosn't work for you
[18:30:26] <jeffreylevesque> would i check my server on the VM on the laptop os - since i port forward to the host laptop?
[18:30:55] <jeffreylevesque> **would i check my server on the VM, or the laptop os - since i port forward to the host laptop?
[18:31:01] <nodist> so what ever server you are using so if its on a VM then yes
[18:31:29] <jeffreylevesque> but i access the application on the host side (laptop), the vm acts like a server
[18:31:38] <jeffreylevesque> then again the js, is on the clientside
[18:33:43] <nodist> client uploads file -> html(with or without js) sends it to server) -> file is received by whatever is running as server and checked
[18:34:10] <jeffreylevesque> i check before file is sent to the server
[18:38:18] <Murdoch5> How do I create an add form for creating a table like in phpmyadmin?
[18:46:12] <nodist> !history
[20:43:31] <SemiNus> hi
