[00:50:49] <paule32> hello
[00:51:03] <paule32> does someone knows "ace editor" channel
[00:51:21] <paule32> i have question: how to change the cursor/caret size
[00:51:34] <paule32> it is too thin, and black
[00:51:43] <paule32> i need bigger, and yellow
[00:53:51] <Cork> paule32: https://ace.c9.io/#support=&nav=support
[01:57:46] <devi8> so before attaching an element to the dom, it's height is always 0 is that a correct assumption?
[02:14:00] <Cork> devi8: the element isn't rendered so the browser haven't calculated a lot of values on it
[02:14:05] <Cork> it isn't always 0 though
[02:14:15] <Cork> (but often not correct)
[02:56:29] <devi8> thanks.
[04:00:57] <devi8> can you change an element's type? If you were writing a <select> element replacement and wanted to use the options as a datalist, could you somehow convert it?
[04:01:14] <devi8> or would you just make a new datalist object, steal it's options
[04:19:03] <Cork> devi8: no, you can't change the tag type, you would have to create a sibling
[04:19:26] <Cork> devi8: this is cause what children are allowed under the element changes depending on what element it is
[06:52:48] <just_> anyone?
[07:30:01] <sinopia> Hello. I'm having a issue with jQuery, I've been doing some code but suddendly it only works on console. It makes some replaces and then disable/enable some options. It worked fine but I've added a few code the rest is working except a part which only works while I execute the code in the devtools console
[07:30:41] <Cork> sinopia: you prob run the code before the dom is ready
[07:30:52] <Cork> (.ready() or $(function() {}))
[07:38:33] <sinopia> Hi Cork. Thank you for your answer. The code starts with $(function() { .. the entire code works except some .on('change', function() {, my knowledge with javascript/jquery is not the best.. check my code http://jsfiddle.net/kazyvfq9/
[07:39:48] <Cork> witch of them?
[07:40:10] <sinopia> Line 274 // Mulher Cores
[07:40:47] <Cork> ugg don't use attribute ends with on ids...
[07:40:54] <Cork> add a class to the elements you want instead
[07:41:26] <Cork> also that selector means it has to end with namoradio AND prod at the same time
[07:41:30] <Cork> so it won't ever match anything
[07:43:14] <sinopia> The two selects are namorado-1-prod and namorado-2-prod for example, but I can switch to classes or ids. But the code if I add that part into the console it works perfectly together with the rest of the code, but I can't figure out what is causing this to don't work on the page launch
[07:43:53] <Cork> ah sorry i miss read i read it as id$ id$ note id^ and id$
[07:44:12] <Cork> you should change that either way, cause it is unpreformant and hard to read
[07:44:31] <Cork> (btw never do attr('disabled', 'disabled') use prop('disabled', true))
[07:47:00] <sinopia> Already changed it thanks. That code I'm having it kinda works but only disables one value. In this case $("select option[value='201']").prop("disabled", true);
[07:49:20] <Cork> sinopia: anyway to answer your question run console.log($('.productSelectTable [id^="namorado"][id$="prod"]').length) on the line before the .on('change' line
[07:49:31] <Cork> if it gives you 0 it means the element doesn't exist in the dom yet
[07:49:41] <Cork> so you are selecting something that doesn't exist
[07:50:09] <Cork> else it prob means you replate the element later so the event handlers are removed (i don't have the dom structure so can't tell)
[07:52:58] <sinopia> Returns 2. Which is correct but I can switch it to: $('#namorado-1-cor, #namorado-2-cor'). Can it be because I've a lot .on('change', function() { in the same element selector?
[07:53:11] <Cork> no
[07:53:16] <Cork> you can have multiple
[07:57:08] <sinopia> var prod_selected = $(this).val(); if(prod_selected === "193" || ........Then I set them to null. I doesn't know if this could be cause this.. Unless I put all this on change at the footer with .ready
[07:57:27] <sinopia> Because if I put them individually at the console all works as desired
[07:57:52] <Cork> sinopia: like i said it most likely cause something replaces the dom element
[07:58:02] <sinopia> I don't receive any error or warning at console. I put some console.log or alerts and the values are all correct
[07:58:03] <Cork> cause when that happens _all old event handlers are removed_
[07:58:26] <Cork> you have a lot of replaceWith in the code, it might be one of them
[08:58:34] <AndresInSpace> $j = jQuery.noConflict(); is all i need to run in noconflict, from both jQuery or $j correct?
[08:58:59] <Cork> to release restore the normal $ ya
[08:59:00] <AndresInSpace> or do i need to:" jQuery.noConflict(); $j = jQuery.noConflict();"
[08:59:16] <Cork> all noconflict does is restore the old $
[08:59:16] <AndresInSpace> yea
[08:59:32] <AndresInSpace> thanks Cork
[08:59:32] <Cork> (well it return it self too)
[08:59:58] <Cork> np
[09:28:42] <v0idpwn> I have some rows being loaded after a button press. Aparently the function for them to be clickable isn't working because they're loaded after. How can I manage this issue?
[09:32:37] <Cork> v0idpwn: bind the event handler as a delegated handler on a static parent
[09:35:12] <v0idpwn> Cork: do you have an example?
[09:35:30] <Cork> v0idpwn: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[09:37:53] <v0idpwn> Cork: but this way how can I know which <li> element was clicked?
[09:38:18] <Cork> v0idpwn: this in the event handler will indicate what element was clicked
[09:38:42] <v0idpwn> Oh, I see.
[09:38:53] <v0idpwn> Thanks :)
[09:39:01] <Xatenev> can someone link me the docs page of $('.selector', variable);
[09:39:14] <Xatenev> $('.selector', variable).on('...', ...
[09:39:30] <Cork> Xatenev: just check the jQuery() page
[09:39:33] <Xatenev> I just find .delegate etc
[09:39:47] <Xatenev> Cork, oh thank you
[09:39:47] <Xatenev> got it
[09:40:22] <Xatenev> Cork, I am using that syntax, e.g. const el = createEl(); $('.someClassInEl', el).on('click'...
[09:40:35] <Xatenev> and then I do el.innerHTML = ... and the listener doesnt work anymore
[09:40:47] <Xatenev> I would have guessed it should still work even though i am changing the html (the class is still in there.)
[09:40:48] <Xatenev> any ideas?
[09:41:29] <Cork> Xatenev: $('', parent) is a short hand for parent.find()
[09:41:43] <Cork> Xatenev: so when you replace parent, all the handlers on the children to it will be removed
[09:41:58] <Cork> as the entire tree below it will be replaced
[09:42:08] <Xatenev> Cork, but im not really replacing the parent
[09:42:15] <Xatenev> Cork, only the innerHTML of the parent
[09:42:28] <Xatenev> Cork, so the delegated listener should still work, or not?
[09:42:34] <Cork> Xatenev: ok, fine so you replace everything inside it except the outer most node
[09:42:38] <Xatenev> yeap
[09:42:44] <Cork> Xatenev: you aren't doing delegation though
[09:42:47] <Xatenev> basically parent.innerHTML
[09:42:55] <Cork> delegation is parent.on('event', 'selector')
[09:43:06] <Cork> not $('selector', parent).on()
[09:43:20] <Xatenev> I see
[09:43:21] <Cork> cause that like i said, only does a parent.find() and attaches the event handler there
[09:43:30] <Xatenev> so i will try delegation
[09:46:32] <Xatenev> Cork, that worked well
[09:46:34] <Xatenev> Cork, thank you
[09:46:38] <Cork> np
[10:13:17] <v0idpwn> Cork: Sorry for taking so long, but, well, it didn't work here. I'll try to make a fiddle
[10:20:26] <sinopia> Cork: Hi again. If I use $("select option[value='200']").prop("disabled", true); this will disable two select options with the same value?
[10:54:35] <adrian_> is there any professional using jqueryui?
[10:55:32] <adrian_> is there any professional using jqueryui?
[10:58:19] <adrian_> is there any professional using jqueryui?
[11:10:14] <paule32> hello Cork
[11:10:18] <paule32> https://www.kallup.solutions/
[11:15:44] <sinopia> Cork: nevermind, I think this might be causing of one .on('change', function() { ... If I comment one part the rest works fine, if I let this normal only this (uncommented) works.
[11:25:31] <v0idpwn> adrian_: I'm not sure if I'm what I call a professional, but I am.
[12:21:02] <Es0teric> i have a question -- does anyone know why i get this TypeError: $(...).find(...).play is not a function error on this: $('#landing').find('.bg-video').play(); ?
[12:22:55] <pavonia> play() is not a jQuery function, is it?
[12:29:03] <Es0teric> pavonia i dont think so
[12:29:07] <Es0teric> so how would I make it play video then?
[12:29:46] <pavonia> find(..)[0].play() might work
[12:30:02] <pavonia> You first get the DOM element and call the function on that
[12:33:43] <Es0teric> pavonia TypeError: $(...).find(...)[0] is undefined
[12:34:56] <pavonia> Are you sure the element actually exists?
[12:35:35] <pavonia> Es0teric: What does $(...).find(...).length return?
[12:36:31] <aro> if i have a string like this "<div><div class="test"><p>hello</p></div></div>", how would i modify that with jquery? this is not a dom element, but a string
[12:36:48] <aro> like if i wanted to remove the <p>
[12:38:12] <Es0teric> pavonia 0
[12:38:30] <pavonia> Yeah, then there's no matching element
[12:39:05] <pavonia> aro: Try $("<div>...").remove("p").html()
[12:39:20] <aro> I did
[12:39:32] <aro> https://codepen.io/barrychapman/pen/BvGNVG?editors=1010
[12:40:17] <aro> when you click the button u can see it doesnt remove it
[12:42:25] <pavonia> $(INFOTABLE) creates a new element on each call, you don't modify the string by that
[12:42:34] <aro> oh
[12:43:11] <aro> what should i do
[12:45:35] <pavonia> Have you tried what I suggested?
[12:45:46] <aro> yes i just did it and it works
[12:45:54] <aro> i dont know why that didnt occur to me
[12:46:11] <aro> i just initialized a var with $(INFOTABLE);
[12:52:57] <Es0teric> how would i play html5 video with jquery though?
[13:00:26] <pavonia> Es0teric: The problem in your case doesn't seem to be playing the video but finding the right element in the DOM. If the result set is empty, your selector is wrong
[13:00:37] <pavonia> or the element just isn't there
[13:14:02] <Es0teric> hmmm
[13:16:31] <robertmaxrees> ?

[14:46:49] <royalty> hi guys
[14:47:04] <royalty> anyone want to play some bball, I'm located in Maryland
[14:47:10] <royalty> oh wrong chat
[15:44:55] <gambl0re> hello?
[15:45:17] <royalty> gambl0re, sup dude want to eat some ramen?
[15:46:12] <gambl0re> royalty, hey hows going?
[16:01:13] <paule32> hello
[16:01:27] <paule32> i need your help: https://jsfiddle.net/fq3jagd0/1/
[16:01:37] <paule32> how can i minimaze the code
[16:02:11] <paule32> i would like use the comented code, but in dynamic way
[16:06:04] <gambl0re> how do i pass the index/key? {data.map(this.renderProjects)}
[16:38:44] <skypce_> paule32, you can use gulp
[16:39:01] <skypce_> or webpack
[16:39:16] <skypce_> paule32, can you help me with some thing please
[16:39:39] <paule32> i am new
[16:39:43] <paule32> but let take
[16:40:38] <skypce_> what do you need paule32? minimize css and js?
[16:41:06] <paule32> not, yet
[16:44:08] <skypce_> paule32
[16:44:09] <skypce_> https://codepen.io/skypce/pen/MZzbVW
[16:45:06] <skypce_> please check the $extrafield the problem is that this var contains many vars inside , when i do a submit always keep the first option selected in the input fields and not the current state selected by the user
[16:45:55] <skypce_> i need that when submit the form , all inputs with the selected values will submit, and not in the original state only
[17:06:34] <robertmaxrees> skypce_ you're more likely to get help with an isolated test case.
[17:07:56] <robertmaxrees> paule32 you should add and remove classes and do all that via css for starters.
[17:26:10] <paule32> hi robertmaxrees
[17:26:13] <paule32> skypce_:
[17:26:17] <paule32> https://www.kallup.solutions/
[17:32:48] <paule32> how can i implement a preloader, so that a animated graphic is display during load?
[17:33:02] <paule32> hi robertmaxrees
[17:33:21] <paule32> you missed: https://www.kallup.solutions/ ?
[17:47:30] <robertmaxrees> paule32 what did i miss?
[17:48:13] <paule32> to take a look to my website
[17:48:19] <robertmaxrees> why??
[17:50:26] <paule32> you highlight me, to play with classes ...
[17:50:38] <robertmaxrees> i was responding to your question.
[17:50:47] <robertmaxrees> that would make that code much shorter.
[17:53:18] <paule32> how can i hide/show all <div class="tab1_n"> where n are the numbers of the div ?
[17:56:38] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:56:43] <robertmaxrees> give them all a shared class.
[18:17:45] <paule32> ok works
[19:09:20] <paule32> can i drag&drop all elements that have a selector with jquery?
[19:46:28] <sine0> whats the best way to ensure that jquery functions run on the dom when in desktop mode, but not in mobile
[19:47:02] <robertmaxrees> "run on the dom"?
[19:47:10] <robertmaxrees> you mean how do you make jquery not run at all on mobile?
[19:47:15] <sine0> yea
[19:47:25] <sine0> or only certain things
[19:47:35] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there are a few strategies for that.
[19:48:15] <robertmaxrees> depending on how your code is organized, you could use some kind of "initDesktop", "initMobile", "initAll" functions that you call that do their magic as needed.
[19:48:35] <robertmaxrees> or maybe your components themselves can check.
[19:48:46] <robertmaxrees> there won't really be a magic button, though.
