[00:38:00] <Crimlo> hola amigos
[01:12:52] <lordjancso> morning all
[01:13:58] <lordjancso> i have a question about push states. its clear to me how to switch url, but what if i switched from / to /test, then i refresh my browser, i will have a 404 error
[01:15:03] <lordjancso> how can i get back the current page? how can i detect is this a valid url which should be resolved by webserver, or a pushed url which should be resolved by client?
[01:28:05] <ravenzz> lordjancso: you should update the url to an existing endpoint
[01:28:21] <ravenzz> otherwise there is not point in using push state
[01:28:40] <lordjancso> ravenzz what do you mean? sorry i'm new with push states :)
[01:31:04] <ravenzz> you should change your url to /test only if you are able to serve a request to it from the server
[02:08:09] <simpy_> hi
[02:08:54] <simpy_> is there any solution to replace the for attribute of jquery validate error message
[03:57:36] <asd> yo
[03:57:57] <hellyeah> is there a way to hide html element from page source?
[03:58:23] <Uhkis> yes, edit the html :-D
[03:58:57] <hellyeah> html part is generated by asp.net i dont have any control over html
[04:01:28] <Uhkis> then no
[04:04:00] <hellyeah> Uhkis:
[04:04:16] <hellyeah> so is there a way to shoÄ±w html element as empty in page source not in dom
[04:05:45] <Uhkis> still no
[04:09:16] <Cork> hellyeah: the only option you have if you have to hide the content from the user is to stop using html and draw it all manually in a canvas
[04:09:54] <Cork> cause then you can send it using eme and then generate the canvas from that
[04:10:10] <Cork> but i'm quite sure you aren't interested in the development cost of getting that to work...
[04:10:37] <Cork> the web is open by design
[04:10:44] <Cork> (except for eme)
[04:10:49] <hellyeah> eme?
[04:10:56] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:11:00] <hellyeah> let me check
[04:11:06] <Cork> the drm solution implemented for video streaming
[04:11:26] <Cork> you will have to have a eme backend to encrypt the data
[04:12:30] <DmitryE> hi all
[04:13:43] <DmitryE> i've got open issue about autocomplete control
[04:13:57] <DmitryE> anybody can help me&
[04:14:00] <DmitryE> ?
[04:14:06] <Cork> not before you ask the question
[04:14:53] <Cork> (don't ask to ask, for someone, or similar. Just ask the question)
[04:18:33] <DmitryE> in option list is string value with slash ("/") symbol, for example "123/456", when i input "123" autocomplele show to me "123/456" in listbox, but when i input "123/" - autocomplete hide lisbox
[04:20:01] <ndee> isn't there an option, where I can toggle a an element, from another element? e.g. <input type="button" data-toggle="#item" /><div id="item">Hello world</div>? I want to show and hide div#item by clicking on the button.
[04:23:25] <DmitryE> autocomplete does not allow slash ("/") in input string?
[04:23:42] <Cork> DmitryE: yes it does, could you provide a jsfiddle demo of the problem?
[04:24:30] <Cork> ndee: $('#item').toggle()
[04:24:38] <Cork> ndee: as you have an unique id on it just use that
[04:25:22] <ndee> Cork: I want to execute it from the button without writing additional JS and I thought there was a way, just with data-attributes.
[04:25:30] <Cork> uh
[04:25:43] <Cork> no if you want to add none standard actions, you have to use js
[04:26:05] <Cork> data- attributes is just data it doesn't cause code to run unless you write that code
[04:26:21] <ndee> kk
[04:26:32] <Cork> i start to suspect your talking about jquery mobile, and it adds some things like that
[04:26:47] <Cork> and i don't keep up with jqm as i don't us it
[04:26:50] <Cork> *use
[04:26:51] <ndee> ah true, you're right, I used that once with jqm.
[04:27:12] <ndee> confused it with normal jq, thanks for the hint :)
[04:27:59] <Cork> ndee: to be extra clear to normal html/js data- attributes just means "none spec extra data" nothing else
[04:28:18] <Cork> the spec only says an attribute prefixed by data- is reserved for site specific data
[04:28:28] <Cork> so it won't ever conflict with future spec attributes
[04:39:00] <hellyeah> hey why it alert object object https://jsfiddle.net/qrpj6dbL/
[04:42:57] <guideX> is there such a thing as pure html5 webcam
[04:43:07] <guideX> something i can save to server side
[04:43:13] <Uhkis> nope
[04:43:38] <guideX> which peice is missing
[04:43:39] <mooncup> can anyone help me spot an error?

[06:34:30] <hellyeah> hey
[06:34:39] <hellyeah> is there a way to call method with url?
[06:40:47] <jmorris1501> Hello everyone, having a small issue trying to get the value of an input of type = hidden where the value is set while iterating through a java arraylist. I have tried using class, name, and id tags, as well as various selectors, and I still can't seem to get the right values. Code segment at the following url : http://kpaste.net/f8f080
[06:50:36] <rindolf> jmorris1501: why not accept arguments in the function() { .. } callback?
[06:50:59] <rindolf> jmorris1501: I'm not sure $(this) is what you want.
[06:58:18] <jmorris1501> rindolf: can look into that. arguments such as?

[07:52:36] <gonssal> hellyeah: that's what the data: property is for
[08:15:14] <keglevich> hey all...I would need some small help with simple jquery drop-down menu I have intergrated in a wordpress aiste and its actually working 90% already...it just needs two small fixes, but I'm unable to do this myself... if anyone is willing to look into it, I'd be glad to provide details!
[08:43:06] <hellyeah> yo
[08:43:40] <hellyeah> my getdate function has some parameters how can i set parameter for that function in ajax https://jsfiddle.net/5ubLsdak/
[08:54:57] <mrburied> If, I use $("#myDatepickerInput").datepicker({
[08:54:58] <mrburied>   date: new Date()
[08:54:58] <mrburied> };datepicker is not opening. Why so?
[08:55:04] <mrburied> http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html#datepicker-usage-javascript
[08:55:25] <mrburied> but doing so $('#myDatepicker').datepicker(); works
[08:57:50] <hellyeah> any tips?
[09:12:14] <taplar> mrburied: seems to work $('input').datepicker({     date: new Date() });
[09:12:23] <taplar> sorry, https://jsfiddle.net/0q4zcb2o/
[09:12:37] <mrburied> for me. now
[09:12:41] <mrburied> not*
[09:29:16] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[09:30:15] <hellyeah> i want to give parameters to getdate() what did i do wrong here https://jsfiddle.net/r5su161L/ pls some help
[09:31:12] <decx> what's with the weird ass string in data?
[09:31:34] <hellyeah> weird ass what do you mean?
[09:31:40] <decx> data is just an object
[09:32:10] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1916309/pass-multiple-parameters-to-jquery-ajax-call
[09:32:14] <shoky> he's sending data as json
[09:32:17] <hellyeah> just saw that on stackoverflow
[09:32:34] <decx> weird
[09:32:39] <hellyeah> my gatedate function in c# have parameter called datetime
[09:32:40] <shoky> hellyeah how are you reading the data on the serverside
[09:33:00] <hellyeah> do you ask type of parameters?
[09:33:02] <shoky> because the way you're sending it, you'd need to parse the whole request body as json
[09:33:15] <hellyeah> i am just newbie btw
[09:33:30] <hellyeah> i just need to use datetime as parameter of gatdate
[09:33:44] <shoky> if you want to have a regular post param , then do     data: {datatime: datetimevalue}
[09:33:57] <shoky> and remove the "contentType" option
[09:34:15] <shoky> also you might have a typo?  datatime/datetime ?
[09:34:28] <hellyeah> datetime
[09:34:39] <shoky> yes but in your code you have datatime
[09:35:43] <hellyeah> sec
[09:37:13] <hellyeah> shoky: everything seems okey? http://dpaste.com/1G3TMBV
[09:37:56] <hellyeah> i didnt get any error
[09:38:09] <shoky> hellyeah: the js part does, i think.. no idea about the c#
[09:40:22] <hellyeah> okey no problem
[09:41:58] <hellyeah> shoky: can i see value of parameter on dom?
[09:42:21] <shoky> what do you mean
[09:42:35] <hellyeah> sorry i didnt make sense just a sec
[09:44:27] <hellyeah> no idea function in the backend works
[09:45:26] <hellyeah> success function is executed if the get the content from function in the backend right
[09:47:55] <shoky> it's executed if the server returned a success http response, and if jquery successfully parsed the response data (according to the dataType option, or the response content-type)
[09:48:22] <shoky> so if you have  dataType: 'json'   and the response is not valid json,  the ajax will fail (fail callback will be called, not success)
[09:49:35] <hellyeah> you mean data with response right?
[09:49:48] <shoky> what?
[09:50:02] <hellyeah> data: { datetime: datetimevalue }
[09:50:11] <shoky> that's the request data, not the response data
[09:50:20] <shoky> response data is what your server responds
[09:50:52] <hellyeah> hu mm ic
[09:50:59] <hellyeah> it i,s not JSON it is just a string
[09:51:13] <shoky> if it's not json then you shouldn't have  dataType:'json'
[09:51:33] <shoky> dataType:'json'  causes jquery to try to parse the response as json
[09:52:16] <shoky> but if you want it to be json you can always json-encode the response
[09:52:22] <shoky> however you do that in c#
[09:53:29] <hellyeah> brb
[09:53:41] <hellyeah> thank you shoky i need to smoke
[09:53:45] <hellyeah> i appreciated
[09:53:57] <shoky> enjoy

[09:57:15] <Kingsy> is it possible with slideDown() to start the reveal from the dtop of the element and end at the bottom?
[09:57:50] <Kingsy> i.e the illusion or removing a cover vertically ?
[09:57:59] <Kingsy> I cant think how else to explain it.
[09:59:05] <Kingsy> or ideally a typing simulator that renders html one char or html entity at a time
[09:59:08] <Kingsy> hehe

[14:22:18] <plamble> oh i hadnt hit update

[14:26:17] <plamble> http://jsfiddle.net/plamb/2ybhd2d3/4/
[14:26:22] <plamble> my code looks exactly like that

[14:31:26] <mrburied> everybody is sleeping here.. This is FRIDAY night plamble :(
[14:31:31] <plamble> :(
[14:31:39] <plamble> uh oh theres duch
[14:36:01] <plamble> oh just realized why
[14:36:08] <plamble> that <input> wasnt actually the last-child
[14:44:19] <plamble> how do you turn two strings into a tuple?
[14:46:25] <LindsayMac> plamble:  so you have 'somestring' and 'someotherstring' and you want 'somestring', 'someotherstring' ?
[14:47:31] <plamble> (someString, someotherString)
[14:47:34] <plamble> or better yet
[14:47:46] <plamble> Array((SomeString, SomeOtherString))
[14:48:40] <LindsayMac> plamble:  var myArray = [];
[14:48:47] <plamble> actually
[14:49:00] <plamble> lets start with just (someString, someOtherString)
[14:49:26] <plamble> i dont think the underlying type of a javascript Array can be interpreted by the jvm
[14:50:23] <LindsayMac> jvm ?
[14:50:31] <plamble> java virtual machine
[14:50:39] <plamble> im handling ajax POST's with scala
[14:50:47] <plamble> sending a javascript array i dont think can be interpreted
[14:50:53] <LindsayMac> ok I dont know anything about that....
[14:51:15] <LindsayMac> but typically I like working with arrays but I haven't done any work with scala / jvm
[14:52:19] <LindsayMac> plamble:  i mean you can't you literally just do combinedVar = myVar + ', ' + myOtherVar; return combinedVar
[14:52:44] <plamble> probably, i doubt that would be interpreted correctly either
[14:52:48] <plamble> ill just send Strings
[14:53:00] <LindsayMac> why not?
[14:53:38] <LindsayMac> plamble:  its the same data but you're just formatting it whatever way you want.
[14:53:38] <plamble> i'd prob have to write something that converted the string myVar, myOtherVar into a Tuple[myVar, myOtherVar]
[14:54:09] <plamble> i can get around it by sending bare strings, it just makes my scala method definition a bit more ugly
[14:54:11] <plamble> but oh well
[14:54:51] <LindsayMac> plamble:  maybe .join(',') is what you need
[14:56:22] <LindsayMac> plamble:  just so you're aware... a 'tuple' isn't a JS thing.. you can return an object or an arry...
[14:56:32] <plamble> i see
[14:56:45] <LindsayMac> plamble:  so you can return an object formatted in the way that your java needs it .. ie: ( myVar, myOtherVar)
[14:57:08] <LindsayMac> by literally just making the format your java needs manaully...

[15:20:23] <durwasa> Hi , I am a newbie to javascript. Worse I haven't worked on Jquery or any *js framework. But I want to contribute to Jquery. Can anyone please tell me how to get things started? ?
[15:20:53] <nodist> learn js
[15:21:10] <duch_kazatel> durwasa depends.
[15:21:30] <duch_kazatel> like... if you don't know JS, it's hard to point you in a direction.
[15:21:37] <duch_kazatel> and fwiw, it's jQuery, not Jquery ;)
[15:22:16] <duch_kazatel> you could help work on the documentation and fix grammatical errors/other similar issues.
[15:25:05] <durwasa> nodist, duch_kazatel :: at what point can I evaluate myself and say that I know JavaScript ? Like I have read the book Eloquent JavaScript and I know syntax and the semantics and the flow but at times concepts like promises and deferreds just bounces over me. So, when do I knw that the time is ripe?
[15:25:19] <durwasa> duch_kazatel, sorry :) jQuery*
[15:25:41] <duch_kazatel> durwasa the time is ripe for what?
[15:26:04] <duch_kazatel> because it sounds like you learned a bunch of language basics without actually building anything :)
[15:26:25] <durwasa> duch_kazatel, for contribution
[15:26:45] <duch_kazatel> promises and deferreds don't make much sense until you start building things and see where async programming is great, and is made even better with promises.
[15:27:08] <duch_kazatel> as far as contributing to jQuery, anybody can do it at any time - http://contribute.jquery.org/
[15:27:46] <durwasa> duch_kazatel, yes exactly ... Knowing the semantics is not at all an achievement.  But I was wondering from where I can start so that I could get a hold of the concepts.
[15:27:56] <duch_kazatel> by building something.
[15:27:59] <duch_kazatel> build an app.
[15:28:23] <durwasa> duch_kazatel, Okay :) :)
[15:28:37] <duch_kazatel> apply what you've learned.  and be open to feedback from others about your code.
[15:29:30] <duch_kazatel> put another way, i see college students get hired all the time and have this moment a few weeks after getting hired where they realize that what they learned in college and what they're doing at work are two very different things.
[15:43:58] <user3292026> hi all, I have a rather simple problem but can
[15:45:54] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 ask your question :)
[15:45:56] <user3292026> I am trying to impent a fixed header to our website but cant seem to make the slidedown effect to work. I tried asking  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32968552/fixed-header-slidedown-effect-not-working but did not get an answer yet. can anyone please help
[15:46:07] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, was a bit big :-)
[15:46:08] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 use a library for it.
[15:46:23] <duch_kazatel> this is one of those things that you won't get right yourself - trust me.
[15:46:56] <user3292026> I trust you. I couldn't find what is wrong :-)
[15:47:17] <duch_kazatel> also: that's a LOT of selectors in a scroll handler.
[15:47:20] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, it should work but doesn't
[15:48:08] <user3292026> what I basicly wanted was an amazon/walmart fixed header effect
[15:48:11] <MarkyC> How can I search if a parent element of $foo has the class 'bar'?
[15:48:30] <duch_kazatel> MarkyC .closest('.bar').length
[15:48:38] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 just use a plugin then.
[15:48:39] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[15:48:50] <user3292026> any links?
[15:49:12] <duch_kazatel> http://stickyjs.com/ is a relatively popular one.
[15:50:02] <user3292026> I have 		<script type="text/javascript" src="/presta3/js/jquery/plugins/jquery.easing.js"></script> which should work (I think)
[15:50:26] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 again.
[15:50:27] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:50:31] <duch_kazatel> just use a plugin.
[15:50:53] <duch_kazatel> jquery easing is just a set of animations.  doesn't do anything without you using things like .animate
[15:51:07] <LindsayMac> why a plugin for a sticky menu? Just use some CSS and add/remove classes. Thats what I did
[15:51:21] <duch_kazatel> LindsayMac because 9/10 because write really ugly handlers for those.
[15:51:40] <duch_kazatel> and because a lot of people seem to have trouble understanding position: fixed;
[15:51:56] <user3292026> LindsayMac, I tried but failed :-) have a look www.multitec.gr/presta3/
[15:52:16] <user3292026> the fixed header is working fine. but the animation doesn't
[15:53:48] <duch_kazatel> so when you set the thing to fixed, it's already in place - slideDown() doesn't actually do anything there.
[15:55:29] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, any idea on  what I should change ?
[15:55:56] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 need to change the height and then use slidedown after setting it to fixed.
[15:55:59] <duch_kazatel> something basic like that.
[15:57:17] <user3292026> you mean the height of the header bar ?
[15:57:34] <duch_kazatel> ues.
[15:57:36] <duch_kazatel> *yes
[15:57:42] <duch_kazatel> not sure what other height i'd be talking about.
[15:57:54] <user3292026> just checking :-)
[15:58:50] <user3292026> although I think I tried that at some point...
[15:59:52] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle ;)
[16:00:48] <user3292026> I am going to try :-)
[16:23:38] <derekZero_> If I want the entire body of a page to fade in would I write it like...
[16:23:39] <derekZero_> $("body").onload(function() {
[16:23:40] <derekZero_> 	.fadeIn();
[16:23:40] <derekZero_> }
[16:24:38] <derekZero_> Or am I doing it wrong?
[16:24:46] <dismist> a better approach would be to put an empty div at the bottom of your html and set its properties to { position:fixed; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; background:#fff; }
[16:24:49] <derekZero_> It doesn't appear to be working
[16:25:08] <dismist> which would cover the entire viewport with a white div, which you could then just use css to lower the opacity of in a transition
[16:25:13] <dismist> from 100% to 0
[16:25:40] <derekZero_> Cool move, faster load time than with the jQuery
[16:26:31] <derekZero_> Well I also wanted to have it fall from the top of the screen, so I figured I may as well look at selecting the body
[16:27:43] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, I tried. same problem. the problem seem to be that it can not pickup the transition time stated in .fixed
[16:27:50] <user3292026> http://jsfiddle.net/zkz6er8L/
[16:30:29] <duch_kazatel> as an aside, you really need to move those variable declarations out of that event handler.
[16:30:42] <duch_kazatel> that won't fix anything, but it'll be a good thing to do long term.
[16:35:28] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, done! It indead does not fix anything :-)
[16:36:35] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, and idea of what my fix this ?
[16:36:53] <duch_kazatel> playing around with it.
[16:36:58] <duch_kazatel> i think your styles might be to blame.
[16:37:08] <user3292026> oh nice!
[16:38:04] <notchris> Whats the issue?
[16:38:20] <duch_kazatel> "i think" means i'm still looking at it ;)
[16:38:22] <duch_kazatel> one sec.
[16:39:50] <user3292026> notchris, I am strugeling to make a scrolldown effect to work but can't
[16:39:52] <user3292026> http://jsfiddle.net/zkz6er8L
[16:39:56] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:39:59] <duch_kazatel> oh ok.
[16:40:01] <duch_kazatel> good luck notchris :)
[16:40:18] <notchris> Works on mine
[16:40:21] <user3292026> notchris, it seems it can pickup the transision from the css
[16:40:23] <notchris> It just needs to stay at the top?
[16:41:00] <user3292026> notchris, the "fixed" part works fine. the animation does not
[16:41:42] <user3292026> the transition: all 1.5s ease-in-out 0s; seems to be completly ignored
[16:41:53] <user3292026> no matter what you put there nothing happens
[16:43:30] <user3292026> while scrolling down. I notest that together with ".fixed" a "style" is also added. can that be the issue ?
[16:48:20] <notchris> user3292026: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/emqf9n1g/
[16:50:35] <notchris> Oop
[16:50:37] <notchris> user3292026: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/emqf9n1g/1/
[16:50:39] <notchris> That works
[16:52:08] <notchris> Better: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/emqf9n1g/2/
[16:52:13] <notchris> user3292026:
[17:10:18] <user3292026> I thougth this was easy... :-(
[17:10:37] <duch_kazatel> it'd strip away everything else and get the basics.
[17:14:14] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, did that also.
[17:14:28] <abishek> i have an issue with the file drag and drop events. i have the events set on the document and I want to show an overlay when the file is dragged over the document. if the file is not dropped by the user, i want to hide the overlay. I have configured the `dragLeave` and the `dragEnd` events. I can't seem to get it working for the file dragged but not dropped scenario. could someone advice on what the issue could be
[17:17:06] <Velveeta> i don't have any advice for that specific issue, except that i use a 3rd party plugin to handle my drag and drop uploads... https://www.npmjs.com/package/filedrop
[17:17:35] <Velveeta> and it handles the addition/removal of css classes during drag operations, so that you can style your drop pads appropriately
[17:21:02] <AnoHito_> Hi, so uh, I have been writing a jquery plugin for modal/non-modal popup windows.
[17:22:07] <AnoHito_> I decided to write it because it seemed like there were a million different plugins that were essentially doing the same thing in a slightly different way, and I wanted to create something that would be useful for the majority of situations
[17:22:25] <duch_kazatel> great!  what's your question?
[17:22:27] <AnoHito_> there is a git here: https://github.com/An0Hit0/Popup
[17:22:34] <duch_kazatel> oh...
[17:22:38] <duch_kazatel> no question AnoHito_?
[17:22:43] <AnoHito_> and a live demo here: http://files.isans.net/Popup/demo/index.html
[17:22:46] <AnoHito_> sort of
[17:22:51] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:23:03] <AnoHito_> the question is more along the lines of, is this something people actually find useful or not
[17:23:16] <duch_kazatel> i think you kind of said it yourself earlier.
[17:23:23] <AnoHito_> or is there anything that could make it better
[17:23:38] <duch_kazatel> "there [are] a million different plugins that were essentially doing the same thing in a slightly different way"
[17:23:43] <duch_kazatel> so what makes yours better?
[17:23:47] <AnoHito_> I'm new to jquery, so any advice on how to do things better would be appreciated
[17:24:19] <AnoHito_> I wrote it to be flexible, so it could do the things all the other libraries were doing with very little code
[17:24:34] <AnoHito_> but I tried not to bake in any more features than were neccesary
[17:25:23] <duch_kazatel> that's almost 1000 lines.
[17:25:28] <AnoHito_> but you can do some cool things if you look at the demo
[17:25:43] <AnoHito_> yea, it's been getting bigger since I added support for events and callbacks
[17:25:53] <duch_kazatel> heh
[17:25:58] <AnoHito_> the demo is an overview of what it does with code snippets
[17:26:00] <duch_kazatel> why callbacks?
[17:26:15] <duch_kazatel> is it doing anything async?
[17:26:28] <AnoHito_> so for example, if you want to cancel the close action if a user clicks on the close button before a form is filled out
[17:26:35] <duch_kazatel> errr
[17:26:36] <AnoHito_> and action can be cancelled
[17:26:46] <Velveeta> well, i could see the inclusion of callbacks as a nice prepping step to potentially using something like requestAnimationFrame in the future
[17:26:53] <Velveeta> but if there's no intention of that..
[17:26:56] <duch_kazatel> i feel like that's turning your idea on its head, then.
[17:27:13] <AnoHito_> animations can just be done by catching events
[17:27:27] <AnoHito_> like you write a callback for the open event to do an animation
[17:27:28] <duch_kazatel> so can everything you just talked about.
[17:27:33] <Velveeta> oh i'm not talking about doing animations.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame
[17:27:48] <Velveeta> just making ui updates in a performant way
[17:28:12] <AnoHito_> oh, I wasn't even aware you could do that ^^;
[17:28:47] <AnoHito_> I want to put in a feature to define default animations, but I haven't done it yet
[17:28:54] <Velveeta> if your code starts out with an async interface, you can swap in an async implementation in the future if you want, without breaking the interface
[17:29:04] <Velveeta> so, the one thing i would caution is this:
[17:29:12] <AnoHito_> the only async part is the ajax loading
[17:29:33] <AnoHito_> and the dragging interface I guess
[17:29:48] <Velveeta> don't let feature-stuffing overly bloat your code if there's not a realistic use case for it... if somebody just needs a modal that behaves as a minimalistic modal, they'll pass up this option just because of the byte count
[17:29:57] <AnoHito_> ...and the centering, but those things are all self contained
[17:30:19] <AnoHito_> I think everything that's there is generally useful though
[17:30:23] <Velveeta> in other words, don't try to build the plugin to end all plugins by combining features from every different other one into 1 solution, because any given user will only use a fraction of those features
[17:30:33] <AnoHito_> and the code can be minified, I just have a verbose coding style I guess
[17:30:45] <Velveeta> it's certainly good experience
[17:30:56] <AnoHito_> no, I didn't really try to do that
[17:31:16] <Velveeta> "AnoHito_: I wrote it to be flexible, so it could do the things all the other libraries were doing with very little code"
[17:31:41] <AnoHito_> I mean little code for the person using the library. ;)
[17:31:53] <duch_kazatel> so wait.
[17:31:57] <duch_kazatel> what's the goal with the plugin?
[17:32:06] <duch_kazatel> is it minimal?  or is it fully featured?
[17:32:19] <AnoHito_> depends on how you look at it I guess...
[17:32:47] <AnoHito_> it quite a few things built in, but only because they would be useful for a lot of cases
[17:33:02] <AnoHito_> like built in support for backgrounds, but you don't have to use them
[17:33:17] <Velveeta> i think he's saying it's meant to be highly flexible and feature rich, with minimal code being necessary to use it
[17:33:30] <AnoHito_> something like that. ;)
[17:34:00] <AnoHito_> and if you look at the examples, you can see some pretty fancy things can be done with little code
[17:34:25] <AnoHito_> like the loading screen demo practically needed to be hacked in, but it was still really easy to do
[17:35:09] <AnoHito_> you can even do crazy things like change the template while the window is being displayed if you want to
[17:35:26] <Velveeta> i'm just curious how many of those features will actually be used.. i've seen the knife cut both ways in my time.. "don't let great be the enemy of good enough" as well as "don't let good enough get in the way of great"
[17:35:41] <Velveeta> in this scenario, i'd be inclined to go for the 1st of those expressions
[17:35:58] <Velveeta> as in, most people don't have a use case for swapping out the template of a modal while it's being displayed, typically
[17:35:59] <AnoHito_> what I tried to focus on, are the kinds of things that would be difficult to implement if the library didn't already support them
[17:36:13] <AnoHito_> because that is how you end up with a million different plugins
[17:36:33] <Velveeta> well, you could always try writing them as your own plugins and deploying them together as a modular system
[17:36:54] <AnoHito_> for example, not that many people need to change a template while the window is being displayed, but if you do and the feature isn't built in, it's probably more trouble than it's worth to implement it yourself...
[17:37:07] <Velveeta> so you would have a basic "modal" offering that did 90% of what a basic modal is expected to do, and people could then load the bundled extensions if they wanted additional features that were more off the wall
[17:37:25] <Velveeta> that's true, but the same could be said for any given feature
[17:37:43] <AnoHito_> in theory, but so much of the stuff being done had to be part of the core design to do it efficiently
[17:38:00] <AnoHito_> if you didn't do it that way, the whole thing could devolve into one big hack
[17:38:23] <Velveeta> it's like, if somebody wants to drag the modal around and have a ghost trail in its wake, that's not something most people would ever do, but somebody might, and it'd be kind of a pain in the ass to implement, but that doesn't mean it should be a part of the core package because somebody might someday want that
[17:38:54] <AnoHito_> but that is okay, because I have a drag event that someone could use to implement it
[17:39:09] <AnoHito_> so a feature like that is easy to add, and doesn't need to be part of the core design
[17:39:23] <Velveeta> i'm not trying to tear this down or anything, i'm just saying to be smart about the battles you choose for inclusion, to not unnecessarily bloat your code with rare use cases
[17:39:54] <Velveeta> that's part of why there are a million different modals out there
[17:39:59] <AnoHito_> I understand, I think I made the best tradeoffs I could in terms of including features vs avoiding bloat
[17:40:32] <AnoHito_> some things I felt really needed to be baked in to do well, while other things like animations for example, can mostly be left to the user
[17:41:14] <derekZero_> How does one tell jQuery to do something upon loading the page? Is it .onLoad?
[17:41:43] <Velveeta> derekzero_: you can use on('load' or on('ready'
[17:41:55] <Velveeta> depending on what you're targeting
[17:42:37] <Velveeta> ready waits for the dom to be physically constructed and ready for referencing, but not necessarily assets like images to be done loading... load waits for everything to be finished loading... 'ready' is what most people use
[17:42:42] <derekZero_> If I want to target all the content on a page to fade in would I do something like ('body')on('ready' ?
[17:43:10] <derekZero_> I see, thanks Velveeta
[17:43:43] <Velveeta> not body, but document or window, depending on the event you're waiting for... $(window).on('load', or $(document).on('ready'
[17:44:07] <Velveeta> if you wanted the content, including images, to fade in once completely loaded, use 'load'.. if it's just text content, you're probably fine with 'ready'
[17:44:22] <AnoHito_> I guess I do sort of get you point in that a lot of people may just choose something more simple as long as it meets there needs, although my plugin is generally not that complicated to use... one thing that I do notice with other plugins though is that they have issues with certain things
[17:44:53] <AnoHito_> like almost every plugin I've seen has broken centering when zooming is enabled
[17:45:10] <AnoHito_> or the background doesn't fill the screen
[17:45:20] <AnoHito_> or other just weird or random bugs
[17:45:45] <AnoHito_> I tested my plugin to make sure it worked 100% across all major browsers
[17:45:49] <AnoHito_> even opera ;)
[17:46:11] <AnoHito_> I still need to do testing for IOS, but I'm saving that for when it's mostly completely
[17:46:15] <AnoHito_> which is nearly is
[17:46:17] <Velveeta> it's not so much about simplicity of the interface, it's about aggregate file sizes.. yours is currently weighing in at about 24k.. if you added promise support in addition to callbacks, it would get even larger, plus whatever else you're planning to add..
[17:46:25] <Velveeta> there are other modal packages out there at like 1k
[17:46:44] <AnoHito_> I wonder what it would be if minified...
[17:47:16] <Velveeta> if minified, it would probably scale down similarly, so if it crunched down to say, 10%, you're still looking at 2.4k for yours vs 100 bytes for the other
[17:47:55] <AnoHito_> true, but I don't think that would be a big deal for most people
[17:48:07] <Velveeta> and when you're weighing that against an overall feature set for your site, which may also include a draggable/droppable library, an ajax uploader, and anything else, those bytes all start to add up
[17:48:20] <AnoHito_> I see websites all the time now that have megabytes of images that need to be loaded
[17:48:46] <duch_kazatel> perception is not reality ;)
[17:48:58] <duch_kazatel> lots of people will obsess about the js file size.
[17:49:01] <Velveeta> true, i was looking at stuff on carnival.com's site the other day, and they had images clocking in at up to 25 megs.. for a single image.. rendered into about a 4x4" box on the screen
[17:49:03] <duch_kazatel> and not think about their images.
[17:49:16] <Velveeta> i wanted to contact their web people and scream at them
[17:49:51] <Velveeta> i get about 150mbps on wifi in the house, so it was still only a few seconds to load them, but if i can visibly see those things loading, i know they have to be enormous
[17:51:04] <AnoHito_> so I don't think a few kilobytes is a deal breaker for most people. if it is, you might just want to write something from scratch anyway, to keep everything at the absolute minimum size
[17:51:10] <decx> bigger images lead to better conversions, i only use raw
[17:52:55] <AnoHito_> well, I guess the big question is, if you needed to a modal interface for a website, is this something you would consider using?
[17:52:57] <Velveeta> i would say that statement holds true to a point
[17:53:39] <AnoHito_> you can speculate about why a person may or may not want to use it, but what do you think personally?
[17:53:40] <Velveeta> when you're talking about a 25meg image in a page that you could easily swap in say, a 1meg image for with no real visible loss of quality and a vastly improved experience, there's a tradeoff at a certain point
[17:54:46] <Velveeta> my own response would be that if i needed a modal interface for a site, i would probably go with the least obtrusive solution that fit my existing tech stack... if i was using jquery ui, i'd just use their dialog widget
[17:55:18] <Velveeta> if i was using react (which i am now), i'd use some kind of react modal.. if i was just shopping around in general, i'd use the one that had the feature set i wanted in the smallest file size
[17:56:15] <AnoHito_> mmm... I guess that makes sense. but I do think that there is a demand for something that just works in the majority of the situations without having to think about it too much or write very much code
[17:56:50] <duch_kazatel> AnoHito_ i don't have to write much code for the majority of my cases :)
[17:57:01] <Velveeta> well, the thing is, that's spoken like a developer as opposed to a consumer
[17:57:07] <duch_kazatel> like, right on for making a plugin, but i feel like you're trying to have it be everything for everybody.
[17:57:15] <Velveeta> a developer wants something that works in the majority of cases.. a consumer wants something that works in the majority of *their* cases
[17:57:35] <Velveeta> looking at all of the items you have built into this thing, i would probably pass because i wouldn't ever need 75% of them
[17:57:41] <duch_kazatel> "it's small and only does what you need.  it covers a majority of use cases."
[17:58:26] <Velveeta> now, like i said, if you published this thing as basically a core module plus a set of plugins that people could add in as needed, i could see a much higher rate of use
[17:58:37] <Velveeta> because then people could include just the bits and pieces they wanted at any given time
[17:58:46] <Velveeta> and out of that 24k offering, they might only need to load 2k of it
[17:59:11] <duch_kazatel> woah.
[17:59:18] <duch_kazatel> it's 1/4 the site of jquery?
[17:59:28] <AnoHito_> hmm... I will take that into consideration. I think it could be done, but some things are easier to separate than others
[17:59:46] <AnoHito_> I have a verbose coding style, so I have a habit of writing long code...
[17:59:51] <duch_kazatel> that's fine.
[17:59:53] <duch_kazatel> use a minifier.
[18:00:06] <AnoHito_> it's not so bad for compiled languages, but yea ;)
[18:00:17] <Velveeta> ok, i gotta get out for now, good luck
[18:00:50] <AnoHito_> thanks for the feedback
[18:00:56] <Velveeta> no problemo

[18:39:31] <user3292026> http://www.multitec.gr/presta3/68-%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%AC-%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%86%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B1.html
[18:40:30] <muranjan> duch_kazatel: Yes it is working.. what could be wrong with this code..
[18:40:45] <muranjan> not getting any error in console as well
[18:41:23] <theskillwithin> user3292023 your name is really wierd
[18:41:28] <duch_kazatel> muranjan check your network console.
[18:41:33] <duch_kazatel> user3292026 cool.
[18:42:20] <user3292026> theskillwithin, am I wierd so.... :-)
[18:42:38] <muranjan> duck_kazatel: not getting anything in console
[18:42:39] <theskillwithin> just type /nick IamL33t
[18:42:40] <muranjan> no error
[18:43:38] <duch_kazatel> muranjan dunno then.
[18:43:58] <user3292026> duch_kazatel, thanks for the hint. going to sleep now.
[18:44:30] <muranjan> thanks duch_kazatel:
[19:01:50] <skylerb> Iâm having trouble appending the first <li> onto a <ul> based on checkbox clicks http://jsfiddle.net/dfzrt3qt/2/ I think itâs beacause they are both being created at the same time
[19:05:33] <LindsayMac> Trying to work out some logic on how to do this..
[19:06:23] <skylerb> Yeah itâs been tricky been working on it for a few hours
[19:06:29] <derekZero_> If I want elements to slide down on ready do I need to hide them first?
[19:07:19] <LindsayMac> Kingsy:  looks like its working in your fiddle.
[19:07:24] <LindsayMac> whats wring?
[19:07:38] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  yes. they need a smaller start point
[19:08:08] <derekZero_> Thanks LindsayMac
[19:09:39] <derekZero_> Also, I noticed htmldog.com teaches to import jquery with a CDJN link, and W3 teaches to import from googleapis. Is there a best practice for this? Does it matter?
[19:11:07] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  whichever
[19:11:15] <derekZero_> Cool
[19:19:31] <teamcoltra> Okay so I would post this to JSFiddle but it's not saving it keeps reverting back to a blank screen: I am trying to add a confirmation for people clicking a delete button before it actually deletes... http://pastie.org/10471341 but even when you say "no" it still follows through with the link
[19:22:23] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra: what is your code that triggers the delete? That is probably happening on click or submit or something so its going to still continu
[19:22:43] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra: you want to bind your delete event to the "YES" answer click now
[19:25:02] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac what you see is what you get in this case. I can put that code on a blank html page (obviously with the formatting) and it will go to the link -- it happens on jsfiddle too.  There is a line of PHP code for actually deleting but that doesn't trigger until the page load so it's the link still being actived even through the delete.
[19:25:22] <LindsayMac> huh?
[19:25:35] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac luckily this issue encouraged me to just handle the delete through ajax and make it pretty while fixing the issue
[19:26:50] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac sorry maybe I misunderstood your question, but everything that is happening is in the paste. There is nothing more going on. If you took the commented link and clicked it, it would trigger the confirmation, but then would take you to the link after you say "no" anyway
[19:28:28] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra:  ok. so i'm going ot GUESS you are using some type of confirmation plugin?
[19:29:10] <teamcoltra> No, I am using confirm() which seems to be a built in javascript function
[19:29:26] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra:  i dont think it is ..
[19:29:40] <LindsayMac> lemme google
[19:29:55] <OnceMe> hello how can I get a video class in jquery
[19:30:05] <OnceMe> currently I do this var video = document.getElementById('video');
[19:30:06] <LindsayMac> ah ok.. it is a js method..
[19:30:08] <OnceMe> which is in pure JS
[19:30:38] <LindsayMac> $('#video) OnceMe will get an object with the ID of video
[19:30:41] <OnceMe> however I have <video class="allvideo">...</video> <video class="allvideo">...</video> and therefore I need to get them
[19:31:02] <OnceMe> so will $('.allvideo') make video object?
[19:31:09] <OnceMe> I need addEventListener
[19:31:12] <OnceMe> and currently addEventListener is null
[19:31:56] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra: what I was saying is if you have the delete submission happening during a certain event (either in PHP with something like if($_POST['submit']) or JS.. the php could still trigger.
[19:32:30] <LindsayMac> OnceMe: that will grab all of the nodes with 'allvideo' class
[19:32:41] <OnceMe> ah I think I got it
[19:32:45] <OnceMe> I need to use $(this)
[19:32:49] <OnceMe> Ill try smthg, hold on
[19:32:58] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  code?
[19:33:37] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac Yeah there is a if $_GET['delete'] but the actual URL is changing, so I know the link is actually being triggered. It would be my assumption that confirm() should stop the link from being triggered.
[19:33:45] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  also note.. i was just showing you how to use jquery selectors.. You probably want https://api.jquery.com/find/ attached to the selector
[19:34:17] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra:  the URL changes before or at the same time the dialogue pops up, right?
[19:34:22] <OnceMe> yap
[19:34:26] <OnceMe> thats what Im using
[19:34:27] <LindsayMac> then nope...
[19:34:33] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  once it's triggered its run
[19:34:58] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac after I click "No" in the example I gave it even gives me the next "That was close" dialog..  and THEN the the wheel in the tab starts spinning indicating the link is being followed
[19:35:08] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  confirm doesn't ACTUALLY do any confirmation that you want a process to complete.
[19:35:35] <teamcoltra> So the page is waiting for me to make my selection before actually going ahead and following the link...
[19:35:52] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra:  well you get the message because you programmed that message to be there if you answer NO.
[19:35:55] <OnceMe> LindsayMac:do I need to have some trigger
[19:36:06] <OnceMe> or I can jst load this upon jquery load
[19:36:10] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  no idea what you're doing so you're going to have to share code
[19:36:37] <teamcoltra> LindsayMac happens on either side, I thought maybe I misunderstood the response so I tried the opposite and nope that didn't work either.
[19:36:56] <LindsayMac> teamcoltra:  it doesn't matter.. confirm() isn't going to stop a process that was triggered before you opened it from happening
[19:38:33] <CheckYourSix> Hi all. I'm having a bit of trouble getting this code to work. It's halfway there, but I'm a jQuery novice. https://jsfiddle.net/cqzk5f36/
[19:39:01] <CheckYourSix> It's supposed to highlight all duplicates, but it never highlights the originals. Only when it finds it a 2nd time and beyond. How can I make it highlight the originals as well?
[19:43:16] <LindsayMac> CheckYourSix:  i would probably treat it like an array and look for duplicates in your array
[19:45:49] <CheckYourSix> LindsayMac: How can I do that if I don't have the values before the page is rendered?
[19:47:01] <OnceMe> hmm LindsayMac I keep getting TypeError: video.addEventListener is not a function
[19:47:16] <LindsayMac> OnceMe: no idea what you're doing..
[19:47:17] <OnceMe> however I'm im neares videoView and getting .video class
[19:49:23] <skylerb> CheckYourSix: Here you go https://jsfiddle.net/cqzk5f36/2/
[19:49:48] <OnceMe> here LindsayMac http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/
[19:50:13] <OnceMe> as you can see, I check for mouseenter, and then find .video class for nearest (hovered) .videoView
[19:50:26] <CheckYourSix> skylerb: Oh that's awesome. Thanks. What is the difference between what I had and what you changed it to?
[19:50:40] <CheckYourSix> I can see the actual code difference, but what's the logic behind it?
[19:50:42] <OnceMe> I forgot to enable jQuery lib on jsfiddle though ;(
[19:51:41] <OnceMe> as you can see, error occurs on jsfiddle Uncaught TypeError: video.addEventListener is not a function as well.
[19:53:14] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  why are you using $(this) and .closest?
[19:53:35] <OnceMe> how to separate tags then?
[19:53:37] <skylerb> CheckYourSix you used $(this) which are the children I used the parent when you go through each it doesnât go back
[19:53:43] <OnceMe> I want to play closest video hovered
[19:53:57] <OnceMe> actually that video which is hovered
[19:54:24] <CheckYourSix> skylerb: Oh ok. That makes sense.
[19:56:48] <OnceMe> if you have another idea, be free to update my code LindsayMac
[19:56:52] <OnceMe> as long as it's working idea :D
[20:00:06] <skylerb> I need some help with event target I am making a <ul> and <li> at the same time because its all on click but the first <li> wonât append http://jsfiddle.net/dfzrt3qt/2/
[20:03:11] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  your issue is def. a scoping issue
[20:03:18] <OnceMe> ?
[20:03:35] <derekZero_> So I want a div to fadeout when the page is loaded. I can't seem to get it to work. I have a .js file with:
[20:03:35] <derekZero_> $(document).ready(function(){
[20:03:35] <derekZero_> 	$("#fadeout").fadeOut();
[20:03:35] <derekZero_> });
[20:03:35] <derekZero_> But the div just sits there and doesn't fadeout. Any ideas?
[20:03:35] <OnceMe> whats wrong with scope? :O
[20:03:42] <OnceMe> derekZero_:jsfiddle it
[20:03:59] <derekZero_> Never heard of it. I'll check it out.
[20:04:29] <OnceMe> derekZero_:what does the console log says?
[20:04:29] <derekZero_> Ooo, interesting. Thanks OnceMe
[20:04:39] <OnceMe> Do you even have fadeout as id?
[20:05:07] <derekZero_> Yeah I have a div in html with the id="fadeout"
[20:05:16] <derekZero_> It's supposed to cover the whole page
[20:05:35] <derekZero_> What do you mean by console log?
[20:05:41] <OnceMe> jsfiddle is the only way to see whats wrong
[20:05:49] <OnceMe> well maybe you dont have jQuery included or something?
[20:06:00] <OnceMe> console will tell you about any errors
[20:06:03] <derekZero_> I have the src in the head of the HTML
[20:06:08] <derekZero_> coolz
[20:09:10] <derekZero_> How do I give jsfiddle the image files to pull?
[20:09:33] <OnceMe> LindsayMac:any success?
[20:13:25] <derekZero_> Okay, this is maddening. Jsfiddle says everything is perfectly valid. The result view shows exactly what I want, but it doesn't show up that way in my browser when I open the file. How confusing.
[20:13:26] <OnceMe> I solved it Liam`
[20:13:29] <OnceMe> LindsayMac:*
[20:13:29] <OnceMe> :D
[20:13:39] <LindsayMac> oh yea?
[20:13:42] <LindsayMac> lets see your code
[20:14:14] <derekZero_> Me or OnceMe?
[20:14:19] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:
[20:14:27] <OnceMe> here http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/5/
[20:15:55] <MalditoD_> anyone have a jquery code snippet to show and hide a drop down menu that will work on mobile?
[20:16:21] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  ah yep. .get(0)
[20:16:56] <OnceMe> its not covered in docs as I can see though
[20:18:12] <derekZero_> MalditoD_ What about making an HTML ul and and using CSS li:hover?
[20:20:13] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  i have a cleaner version
[20:20:16] <derekZero_> LindsayMac: If JSfiddle shows my code is valid, but opening my code locally in my browser doesn't do what I want, does that just mean I've found browser incompatibility?
[20:20:51] <MalditoD_> derekZero_ tried somehting like that but had issue with that, worked fine in desktop but the menu would't hide after select on mobile
[20:20:57] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  more likely some script incompatibilities
[20:21:30] <OnceMe> LindsayMac:of what?
[20:21:45] <derekZero_> MalditoD_: Interesting, I haven't had that problem. Can I see your code?
[20:21:46] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  your code http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/up2xbbr9/6/
[20:22:10] <OnceMe> yes, and?
[20:22:19] <derekZero_> LindsayMac: What is the difference between browser incompatibility and script incompatibility?
[20:22:35] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  one is a conflict with browsers and one is a conflict between scripts
[20:22:50] <duch_kazatel> weeeee
[20:22:51] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  i rewrote your code so it's cleaner
[20:23:07] <MalditoD_> please here's the url: any help would be greatly appreciated: http://clients.ilmdesigns.com/poly/giving/donors-2014-15/
[20:23:08] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: did you look in the console for errors?
[20:23:13] <MalditoD_> password: panther2015
[20:23:45] <MalditoD_> is the donors list drop down with the blue background giving me the issue
[20:23:54] <OnceMe> ok good
[20:24:09] <derekZero_> LindsayMac: How do I look at console errors? Also, am I supposed to call the .js file with my jQuery in the HTML?
[20:24:14] <MalditoD_> working fine on dsektop but not on mobile
[20:24:25] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ open your dev tools.
[20:24:36] <LindsayMac> derekZero_: q oh wow... ummm yes... you have to tell the HTML page to load the js files
[20:25:07] <derekZero_> MalditoD_: Have you tried media queries? http://www.htmldog.com/guides/css/advanced/mediaqueries/
[20:25:12] <LindsayMac> derekZero_:  to view the console if you are in chrome first you have to go to preferences and turn on developer tools.. Then you can right click and choose web inspector
[20:25:43] <duch_kazatel> derekZero_ fixingthesejquery.com/ is a good guide to debugging JS.
[20:25:52] <derekZero_> LindsayMac: Ha, yeah that just hit me. Dumb mistake.
[20:25:59] <MalditoD_> derekZero_ can you be more specific I have medeia queries in this file yes
[20:26:23] <MalditoD_> LindsayMac would you mind taking a look... pulling my hair out on this one
[20:27:26] <LindsayMac> MalditoD_:  where do I find the code that is making this thing show and hide?
[20:28:13] <derekZero_> Thanks duch_kazatel
[20:28:40] <derekZero_> MalditoD_: I bet LindsayMac could help you more quickly. I haven't debugged too much mobile fun.
[20:29:09] <OnceMe> LindsayMac:got any idea how to import object of class into this var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line('.bottomx', {
[20:29:21] <MalditoD_> working with the enfold wordpress theme... trying to find the drop down functionality file
[20:29:28] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  not sure what you're asking
[20:29:33] <OnceMe> so instead of '.bottomx' I want something like this var bottomx = $box.find('.bottomx');
[20:29:49] <OnceMe> and then final code: var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line(bottomx, {
[20:29:57] <OnceMe> from some reason, this does not work, is this even possible?
[20:30:44] <OnceMe> bottomvideo is inside videoView though
[20:30:49] <derekZero_> What is the syntax for calling my .js file from my HTML?
[20:30:50] <OnceMe> maybe I need to select children or something?
[20:31:00] <OnceMe> <script src="">?
[20:31:02] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  ok well var varName = new nameOfClass({}) doesn't make sense
[20:31:28] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  you're assigning a CLASS to a variable..
[20:31:28] <OnceMe> its a ProgressBar lib
[20:31:52] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  i dont know anything about that ibrary
[20:32:22] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe what library are you working with?
[20:33:22] <OnceMe> https://rawgit.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js/master/dist/progressbar.js
[20:33:45] <OnceMe> well under animate() I could just do $box.find('.bottomvideo').animate()
[20:33:51] <OnceMe> but dunno how to init that class though
[20:34:08] <duch_kazatel> uh
[20:34:11] <duch_kazatel> where are the docs for this?
[20:35:09] <OnceMe> http://kimmobrunfeldt.github.io/progressbar.js/
[20:35:10] <derekZero_> Woo!! It works... JS noob hour was fun.
[20:36:07] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe so what are you trying to accomplish here?
[20:36:30] <OnceMe> to put $box.find('.bottomvideo') obj in constructor
[20:36:32] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  update your fiddle with the code I gave you and this
[20:36:44] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe so this doesn't take jquery objects.
[20:36:47] <duch_kazatel> it wants a selector.
[20:37:09] <OnceMe> look at this http://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/up2xbbr9/6/
[20:37:17] <OnceMe> I need to pass an object, since two instances occur on one page.
[20:37:49] <duch_kazatel> uh
[20:37:52] <duch_kazatel> so you cna't do that?
[20:38:02] <duch_kazatel> err.
[20:38:07] <duch_kazatel> you need to give it a DOM node.
[20:38:30] <duch_kazatel> i'd just pass the selector.  otherwise, tack a .get(0) on the end of your jquery call.
[20:38:59] <OnceMe> ?
[20:39:05] <duch_kazatel> var progressBar = new ProgressBar.Circle($someThing.find('.somethingElse').get(0), {});
[20:39:29] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js#shapecontainer-options the docs are pretty clear.  it wants a "query string" (aka selector) or an element.
[20:40:48] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:that gives no error
[20:40:56] <OnceMe> but, each time I hover, I get another new line
[20:41:08] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe i don't see where your relevant code is.
[20:41:10] <OnceMe> it's not continuing to the last bottomvideo
[20:41:41] <duch_kazatel> hey so i'm not a magician and i cannot see your code right now :) share it.
[20:45:17] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:here http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/7/
[20:45:56] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:this one http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/8/
[20:46:11] <OnceMe> and hover right and hover out, on left so you can see what im tell you
[20:46:17] <OnceMe> and also whats wrong with time percent thing
[20:46:29] <OnceMe> I cant get to progressbar going once I hover out from videoView
[20:47:03] <duch_kazatel> i haven't seen delegate in a while.
[20:47:14] <duch_kazatel> woah that's loud.
[20:47:33] <duch_kazatel> and your problem is you're initializing the progressbar inside the event handler.
[20:47:47] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  why did you strip out the code I gave you?
[20:48:01] <LindsayMac> i removed delegate and made it MUCH cleaner...
[20:48:05] <LindsayMac> MUCH MUCH cleaner
[20:48:39] <OnceMe> how to fix this?
[20:48:50] <duch_kazatel> you can't init in the event handler.
[20:48:52] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  start with the code I gave you as a starting point and THEN add in the progress bar
[20:48:54] <duch_kazatel> init before, call the animate on it.
[20:49:09] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:can you update code?
[20:49:12] <duch_kazatel> noope.
[20:49:15] <duch_kazatel> you can ;)
[20:49:31] <OnceMe> how to init
[20:49:33] <OnceMe> without class?
[20:49:35] <OnceMe> i dont get it
[20:49:50] <duch_kazatel> var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line($box.find('.bottomvideo').get(0), { - this whole thing can't be in an event handler.
[20:49:53] <duch_kazatel> needs to happen before.
[20:49:56] <duch_kazatel> and then you call animate.
[20:50:10] <duch_kazatel> go back to the js LindsayMac gave you btw.
[20:50:11] <duch_kazatel> that was better
[20:50:18] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  thanks ;)
[20:51:18] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  when you put the progressbar init inside an event it is going to create a new instance of it every time the event is triggered.
[20:51:42] <OnceMe> ah I see
[20:51:51] <OnceMe> but this doesnt work http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/9/
[20:52:04] <duch_kazatel> ...
[20:52:08] <duch_kazatel> lol
[20:52:15] <OnceMe> what lol
[20:52:19] <OnceMe> it says container doesnt exist
[20:52:20] <OnceMe> :(
[20:52:22] <duch_kazatel> right.
[20:52:26] <duch_kazatel> because your code makes no sense now.
[20:52:39] <duch_kazatel> $(this) in that doc ready is now the document.
[20:53:11] <duch_kazatel> also, bottomline now only exists in that document reayd handly.
[20:53:13] <duch_kazatel> *handler
[20:53:17] <OnceMe> non no
[20:53:20] <OnceMe> this is updated one http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/10/
[20:53:21] <duch_kazatel> yes yes
[20:53:22] <OnceMe> but its not working
[20:53:28] <duch_kazatel> right.
[20:53:29] <OnceMe> I pasted you the wrong one ;(
[20:53:31] <duch_kazatel> ...
[20:53:34] <duch_kazatel> same problems.
[20:53:37] <duch_kazatel> read what i just told you ;)
[20:53:47] <OnceMe> so how to fix it
[20:53:58] <duch_kazatel> ...
[20:54:01] <duch_kazatel> what do you think?
[20:54:11] <OnceMe> first does ProgressBar has to be in document ready, right?
[20:54:14] <OnceMe> is that good at least?
[20:54:28] <duch_kazatel> if your js is before the relevant parts of the page, yes.
[20:54:42] <duch_kazatel> put your code with LindsayMac's.
[20:54:44] <duch_kazatel> like..
[20:54:47] <OnceMe> ok, now this part
[20:54:49] <OnceMe> var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line('.bottomvideo', {
[20:54:58] <duch_kazatel> stop - before you go any further, this is so hard to read.
[20:54:59] <OnceMe> I dont get how to avoid selector .bottomvideo
[20:55:07] <duch_kazatel> err, you need that selector.
[20:55:11] <duch_kazatel> that's a GOOD thing to do.
[20:55:14] <derekZero_> Can you select the whole body of HTML to .slideDown? Like $("body").slideDown();  ?
[20:55:15] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  you REALLY need to use the version I gave you
[20:56:16] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe either way, the difficulty here is this library really wants a unique selector for each progressbar.
[20:56:29] <OnceMe> correct
[20:56:32] <OnceMe> and that I dont know how to do
[20:56:38] <OnceMe> if I knew, I wouldnt ask ;)
[20:56:47] <duch_kazatel> use IDs.
[20:56:49] <LindsayMac> OnceMe:  you have to do that in the markup...
[20:56:50] <duch_kazatel> and fix your code.
[20:57:05] <zzaichik> derekZero_: you want to animate down the page?
[20:57:09] <derekZero_> duch_kazatel: me?
[20:57:18] <derekZero_> zzaichik: yes
[20:57:21] <LindsayMac> OnceMe: make an ID on each of the progressbar containers that is different for each one
[20:57:32] <OnceMe> I understand what are you all saying
[20:57:38] <duch_kazatel> then try.
[20:57:39] <OnceMe> but I dont want to complicate my code that much
[20:57:43] <duch_kazatel> you have to.
[20:57:46] <duch_kazatel> don't have a choice.
[20:57:48] <zzaichik> $('body, html').animate({ top: 500 }, 1000);  derekZero_
[20:58:03] <OnceMe> and there is still an issue
[20:58:07] <duch_kazatel> var progressBar = new ProgressBar(); <- you now need to pass around that progressBar variable.
[20:58:12] <OnceMe> how would I init every id?
[20:58:16] <duch_kazatel> you can't select the progressbar in the document and manipulate it.
[20:58:17] <derekZero_> zzaichik: Thanks! I'll try that.
[20:58:20] <duch_kazatel> use your server-side code, OnceMe
[20:58:24] <duch_kazatel> edit the html.
[20:58:31] <OnceMe> done
[20:58:37] <OnceMe> now how to use js to get id's
[20:58:38] <duch_kazatel> now fix the problem :)
[20:58:44] <duch_kazatel> document.querySelector()
[20:58:48] <LindsayMac> erhmergerd
[20:59:14] <OnceMe> you do understand that I cant do this: var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line('#video1', { }
[20:59:26] <OnceMe> then dynamically change it to var bottomline = new ProgressBar.Line('#video2', {
[20:59:27] <duch_kazatel> why?
[20:59:28] <OnceMe> right?
[20:59:30] <OnceMe> dafaq
[20:59:35] <duch_kazatel> right.
[20:59:40] <OnceMe> that, I knew without your help
[20:59:44] <duch_kazatel> now you need bottomLine1 and bottomLine2
[20:59:51] <duch_kazatel> or store each one in an array.
[20:59:55] <duch_kazatel> or as properties on an object.
[20:59:56] <OnceMe> lol
[21:00:02] <duch_kazatel> what?
[21:00:09] <OnceMe> that is not going to be efficient
[21:00:10] <OnceMe> at all
[21:00:14] <duch_kazatel> sure it will.
[21:00:24] <OnceMe> just iterating through id's will cost user's cpu
[21:00:27] <duch_kazatel> uh
[21:00:32] <derekZero_> zzaichik: That was cool. It definitely moves the page down, but I want it to slide down from above. Right now it's sliding down from where I want it to end up.
[21:00:33] <duch_kazatel> you're conflating how things work.
[21:00:45] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe also: that's barely going to use any resources.
[21:00:45] <OnceMe> no I dont
[21:00:50] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe yes, you are.
[21:01:00] <OnceMe> no I dont
[21:01:03] <duch_kazatel> lol
[21:01:05] <OnceMe> lol
[21:01:20] <duch_kazatel> like.. you don't have a choice.
[21:01:23] <OnceMe> anyway
[21:01:24] <duch_kazatel> taht's how this library was designed.
[21:01:30] <duch_kazatel> you have to do it that way or use something else/
[21:01:31] <OnceMe> how to fix that line, so it stops when it's done
[21:01:36] <OnceMe> from hovering inside it
[21:01:40] <duch_kazatel> i just explained this to you.
[21:01:43] <OnceMe> dude
[21:01:48] <OnceMe> you havent
[21:01:53] <OnceMe> I already knew all of that stuff
[21:01:59] <duch_kazatel> then why did you ask us?
[21:02:06] <OnceMe> to fix further issues
[21:02:18] <OnceMe> like the one with hovering out, and line still going
[21:02:19] <duch_kazatel> but you're rejecting them entirely.  so what's the deal?
[21:02:21] <OnceMe> for a few ms
[21:02:37] <zzaichik> derekZero_: you'll have to change the "top" value - you can get it from the element you're wanting to slide to with this: $('your element').position().top
[21:02:40] <OnceMe> how to fix progressbar from going further on
[21:02:44] <OnceMe> when I hoverout
[21:03:15] <duch_kazatel> *sigh* which fiddle?
[21:03:31] <derekZero_> zzaichik: Do I need to put something in the .position parenthesis?
[21:03:39] <derekZero_> Leave it blank?
[21:04:00] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/8/
[21:04:33] <duch_kazatel> need to call .stop()
[21:04:49] <OnceMe> ?
[21:04:56] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js#shapestop
[21:05:07] <duch_kazatel> right now you're animating a random percent on mouseover.
[21:05:20] <OnceMe> ah I see
[21:05:29] <shiittl> hey, i have a question about lodash, what is the difference between .map().value and just .map(), I need to iterate a object collection and I see .value () being appended, but I don't see a particula reasoh
[21:05:44] <duch_kazatel> shiittl not really the right place to ask >.>
[21:05:58] <shiittl> i asked in #lodash but only 6 other users :(
[21:06:05] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[21:06:16] <shiittl> maybe someone will take pity -_-
[21:06:25] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[21:06:35] <duch_kazatel> https://lodash.com/docs#prototype-value
[21:06:39] <duch_kazatel> Executes the chained sequence to extract the unwrapped value.
[21:06:46] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:If I init progressbar in docu ready
[21:06:52] <OnceMe> why its not visible inside function?
[21:06:59] <duch_kazatel> because it's only visible in the doc ready.
[21:07:10] <duch_kazatel> welcome to variable scoping.
[21:07:27] <OnceMe> how to make it global then?
[21:07:31] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[21:07:35] <duch_kazatel> you put your code in the document ready.
[21:07:46] <duch_kazatel> global vars are bad.
[21:08:22] <shiittl> how is (map) "Returns the new mapped array." different or modified from (value) "Returns the resolved unwrapped value."
[21:08:36] <OnceMe> here duch_kazatel http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/11/
[21:08:42] <OnceMe> progressbar still doesnt stop
[21:08:43] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe also, for somebody so concerned about performance, your video.addEventListener('ended', function() { is pretty inefficient since that'll run dozens of times.
[21:08:46] <OnceMe> even though I stop it on hoverout
[21:08:51] <zzaichik> derekZero_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6677035/jquery-scroll-to-element
[21:09:06] <duch_kazatel> shiittl dunno!  i'd start reading around and play with it :)
[21:09:10] <duch_kazatel> since this isn't lodash ;)
[21:09:17] <derekZero_> zzaichik: You're awesome! I've been browsing for something like this since you told me about it.
[21:09:41] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe look at your .animate() call.
[21:09:46] <zzaichik> derekZero_: you're welcome :)
[21:10:01] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe you're telling it to animate a certain amount on mouseover
[21:10:16] <OnceMe> yes and on hover im telling progressbar to stop it
[21:10:22] <OnceMe> and you told me that, so whats the fix for this?
[21:10:31] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/up2xbbr9/12/
[21:10:33] <duch_kazatel> big hint.
[21:10:39] <duch_kazatel> check out what's happening there.
[21:11:16] <duch_kazatel> also: that addEventListener is a terrible idea inside that function.
[21:11:24] <duch_kazatel> that mouseover function i mean.
[21:11:41] <duch_kazatel> you're creating a new binding every time the mouseover event fires, which is a lot.
[21:11:45] <OnceMe> so how to fix progressbar
[21:11:50] <OnceMe> how to remove that update or whatever
[21:11:54] <shiittl> ok i have a jquery question, what is a "resolved unwrapped" value
[21:11:55] <OnceMe> whats the fix for it
[21:12:01] <duch_kazatel> shiittl ...
[21:12:04] <duch_kazatel> that's not a jquery question.
[21:12:10] <duch_kazatel> OnceMe fix your timeupdate event binding for starters.
[21:12:19] <OnceMe> how?
[21:12:27] <shiittl> whynot?
[21:12:37] <duch_kazatel> shiittl because it's not?>
[21:12:44] <shiittl> why?
[21:13:26] <OnceMe> duch_kazatel:how?
[21:13:31] <OnceMe> can you update the code
[21:13:33] <duch_kazatel> no.
[21:13:33] <OnceMe> I'm clueless
[21:13:39] <duch_kazatel> take it out of the mouseover event binding.
[21:14:48] <OnceMe> done http://jsfiddle.net/up2xbbr9/13/
[21:15:08] <duch_kazatel> what's with the nested doc ready calls?
[21:15:12] <duch_kazatel> and see your console?
[21:16:20] <OnceMe> this cannot be done
[21:16:23] <OnceMe> I need it inside mouseover
[21:16:29] <duch_kazatel> it can be actually.
[21:16:29] <OnceMe> nevermind Ill fix everything by myself, as always
[21:17:18] <duch_kazatel> lol welp
[21:22:17] <LindsayMac> ok so I have a container that is added to the DOM after an ajax process is finished. I am adding a click handler to an <a> link when the ajax is complete using the ajax 'complete' setting...
[21:22:28] <duch_kazatel> use event delegation instead.
[21:22:45] <LindsayMac> ahh hmmm
[21:23:11] <duch_kazatel> ?
[21:23:54] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  that makes sense.
[21:29:47] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  that was enough to move me aloing ;)
[21:31:15] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[21:31:19] <duch_kazatel> it's because you're paying attention.
[21:31:40] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  yup. I'm trying. I definitely understand more about JS than I ever have before
[21:31:49] <duch_kazatel> good!
[21:32:34] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so I comma separated list of numbers that I am adding to the value attribute of a hidden input field.
[21:33:17] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  on the back end I'm going to have to take those values in a form $_POST (or $_GET , dont know which im going to use) and take each of those values in the comma separated values and iterate through them
[21:34:00] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  is there anything you would do to format / prepare those numbers for such a response? Right now it is either a string of 3243,5632 OR it can be "images: 2424, 3453"
[21:34:29] <duch_kazatel> are you trying to send data or ask the server for data?
[21:34:35] <LindsayMac> sorry no its images: "54345,54345:
[21:34:36] <LindsayMac> "
[21:34:47] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i will be sending data.. so $_POST
[21:35:07] <duch_kazatel> then post JSON instead.
[21:35:14] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  i'll be sending those values, iterating through, creating a new user with these image ID's attached to the user, and responding with the created user's field
[21:35:16] <LindsayMac> page
[21:35:27] <duch_kazatel> don't post a CSV, post JSON
[21:35:31] <duch_kazatel> and use an array.
[21:35:31] <LindsayMac> ok
[21:35:38] <duch_kazatel> convert it in your backend and call it a day.
[21:36:09] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  so this item is already an array but it needs to be attached to a link so I was attaching it to a link using data-images=""
[21:36:17] <duch_kazatel> that works.
[21:36:29] <LindsayMac> I didnt know if i could store an array in the data-images attr
[21:36:54] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/data/ - see the value definition :)
[21:37:24] <duch_kazatel> granted, i wouldn't do it that way all the time - for instance, why are you storing all that image data on the element and not shipping around unique ids for your backend to handle?
[21:39:13] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  not sure what you're asking...
[21:39:52] <duch_kazatel> so what do those three ids have in common?
[21:39:57] <duch_kazatel> why are you attaching them to an element?
[21:40:22] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  some background.. the client has a photo tagging system. Admins can tag users in photos. Sometimes they have a photo with a person who isn't a user and they want to assocate that photo to their name. I am storing these "non Users" in an array with unique IDs and nested in it is an array of the images that are assoicated to them...
[21:40:55] <LindsayMac> NOW.. when a new user goes to register, they will put their first and last name into an input field. If a "non user" record matches their first and last name it will say "IS THIS USER YOU?"
[21:41:05] <duch_kazatel> so those are userids?
[21:41:07] <LindsayMac> Clicking that will signify that it IS them
[21:41:24] <LindsayMac> these are image IDs because the "nonUsers" aren't real users..
[21:41:49] <LindsayMac> I suppose I could store just the user ID and just query the array AGAIN and return the IMG id's for it.. but that actually seems less effecient
[21:42:06] <duch_kazatel> keep your data clean.
[21:42:12] <LindsayMac> because the image IDs are returned already anyways in the DOM. I can update the image ID's as a list in the form
[21:42:24] <LindsayMac> duch_kazatel:  how is this not clean though?
[21:42:24] <duch_kazatel> either way, i gotta go.
[21:42:25] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.
[21:42:28] <LindsayMac> ok thanks!
[21:42:36] <duch_kazatel> eh, exposing a ton of extra data to the frontend it seems like.
[21:42:37] <duch_kazatel> anyway, byeeee.
[22:35:24] <derekZero_> I'm trying to make my body content fadein and slide down from above the page down to the center. So far I have:
[22:35:24] <derekZero_> $(document).ready(function() {
[22:35:24] <derekZero_> 	$("html, body").fadeIn(3000);
[22:35:24] <derekZero_> 	$("html, body").animate({
[22:35:24] <derekZero_> 		top: 500
[22:35:25] <derekZero_> 	}, 1000);
[22:35:25] <derekZero_> });
[22:35:26] <derekZero_> But instead it's descending to the point that I want it to end up at. What am I doing wrong?
[22:35:26] <derekZero_>

[22:58:41] <DarkSector> Forgive me if it sounds vague, I'll try and explain better. But hopefully someone will understand my issu
[22:59:38] <DarkSector> Oh, window.opener
