[01:42:35] <morphyeys> Hello guys, is it possible to capitalize the first letter of a string using jQuery?
[01:43:01] <Uhkis> you don't need jquery for that
[01:43:57] <morphyeys> how to do it then with slice?
[01:44:22] <Uhkis> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1026069/capitalize-the-first-letter-of-string-in-javascript
[01:45:46] <morphyeys> I am on that page already, so I need to write a function for that?
[01:47:14] <Uhkis> no, you just copypaste that already written function :D
[01:48:04] <morphyeys> test.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + test.slice(1).toLowerCase();
[02:37:36] <Fragus> Hi, how to mark input as already changed?
[02:54:34] <p2sk> visually or semantically?
[03:06:57] <tere> hello, anybody here?
[03:07:37] <tere> How to get first typed value on "change" event?
[03:08:35] <Uhkis> tere: as in first character of string?
[03:09:18] <tere> no, the whole value
[03:10:02] <tere> $(".email").on "change", (e) -> console.log(this.value)
[03:10:38] <tere> so i want to compare this.value on second time when user will type somethig
[03:11:19] <Uhkis> you'd have to save it to some global variable
[03:13:33] <tere> yes i tried this, but it's anyway remains the same
[03:14:29] <tere> first_value = null, $(".email").on "change", (e) -> first_value = this.value; console.log this.value; console.log first_value
[03:14:45] <tere> this returns the same value i'm typing in
[03:16:00] <Uhkis> tere: http://jsfiddle.net/Lpue562k/
[03:18:34] <tere> Uhkis, thanks dude!
[03:25:23] <tere> Uhkis, how to reset it if i want to apply it to multiple inputs?
[03:25:33] <Herehere> I have a dropdown with checkboxes. When I click check checkbox then it works fine. But unchecking checkbox doesnt do anython https://dpaste.de/Zn03
[03:26:38] <Uhkis> tere: you need more variables
[03:27:29] <Uhkis> Herehere: prop('checked', true') _SETS_ the value
[03:27:46] <Uhkis> Herehere: you want prop('checked')
[03:28:24] <Herehere> Uhkis: how about uncheck?
[03:28:29] <Herehere> what about*
[03:28:37] <Uhkis> then checked is false..
[03:29:58] <Herehere> Uhkis: doesnt work. Now either check and uncheck doesnt work. I got only 'false' in my console
[03:30:18] <Herehere> and it log twice
[03:31:52] <Uhkis> Herehere: jsfiddle.net
[03:33:57] <Herehere> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/7tp69vee/
[03:37:23] <Uhkis> Herehere: li's dont have checked property
[03:39:10] <Herehere> Uhkis: so what is the solution?
[03:39:38] <Uhkis> depends on the problem
[03:40:32] <Herehere> Uhkis: I expect to console.log('true') if I check the checbox. If I uncheck then I expect to console.log('false')
[03:44:58] <Uhkis> Herehere: http://jsfiddle.net/7tp69vee/1/
[03:47:09] <Herehere> Uhkis: thanks, it works, but i dont know why my code didnt work
[03:47:18] <Herehere> but yours works
[03:47:19] <Uhkis> [13:27] < Uhkis> Herehere: prop('checked', true') _SETS_ the value
[03:47:19] <Uhkis> [13:27] < Uhkis> Herehere: you want prop('checked')
[03:47:25] <Uhkis> as i said in the first place
[03:47:32] <Herehere> oh yes
[03:47:38] <Herehere> sorry for that
[04:05:56] <newke> hi. i have a django form in bootstrap modal. when i click submit button, modal closes, even if form data is not valid. i think its cause of form's action=".", which refreshes a page on POST. how can i workaround this?
[04:06:04] <newke> form is simple subscription form, where email field required
[04:07:01] <Uhkis> event.preventDefault() in your submit handler
[05:03:05] <acidjazz> or return false
[05:14:17] <sash_> return false is the ugly way.
[05:14:39] <sash_> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[05:21:17] <acidjazz> what really an article
[05:21:23] <acidjazz> whys it ugly
[05:22:19] <acidjazz> lame, i know it calls prevent and stop
[05:22:24] <acidjazz> and i want it to
[05:22:34] <acidjazz> its a return false
[05:23:23] <acidjazz> It promotes a poor use of event cancellation and should only be used when you are consciously deciding you need what it provides
[05:23:53] <acidjazz> it promotes poor use of something unless you are conscious
[05:48:33] <morphyeys> hello If I have 4 check boxes with the same id can I check all of them or I should use different ids?
[05:48:43] <taplar> id's can't be repeated
[05:48:58] <taplar> if you want to give them a common identifier, give them a class
[05:48:59] <morphyeys> okay with the same class then
[05:49:17] <morphyeys> okay if they all 4 got the same clas
[05:49:20] <morphyeys> class then
[05:50:32] <taplar> yeah, if you select them all, you can check them all with a single statement
[05:51:16] <morphyeys> hmm?
[05:52:59] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/0tck571a/
[05:53:01] <Mayzie> Hey guys. I'm trying to _vertically_ position an element in the middle. I've found this: http://api.jqueryui.com/position/ , but it seems to force me to also apply a horizontal position as-well? How can I go about vertically positioning an element in the middle of the parent element?
[05:56:01] <morphyeys> is there something like $('.group').prop('disabled', true);
[05:56:29] <taplar> i believe so
[05:56:53] <taplar> yep
[05:57:46] <samssh> Isn't it attribute for disabled?
[05:57:54] <taplar> nope
[05:57:59] <taplar> it's a dom property
[05:58:09] <taplar> there is also the attribute, but it's not necessary to set it in the js
[06:00:23] <Mayzie> :-/
[06:05:52] <morphyeys> taplar, http://jsfiddle.net/a7u1pa9v/
[06:07:21] <taplar> so i'm assuming clicking the parent should trickle to the children?
[06:18:34] <morphyeys> taplar, yes ?
[06:18:56] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/a7u1pa9v/1/ first parent is changed to enable/disable children on change
[06:20:30] <morphyeys> taplar, hmm why only the first?
[06:21:03] <taplar> i added a class to the first parent that the binding is using
[06:21:13] <taplar> didn't do the others, just as an example
[06:23:50] <morphyeys> taplar, okay thank you very much could you give me any tips on how to learn javascript and jquery
[06:24:29] <taplar> take a look at try.jquery.com
[06:24:43] <taplar> other than that, just tinker and you can ask questions here, :)
[06:25:06] <r-ku> when i try to use my plugin it can not find $.mdEditor as if it was not defined. $.fn.mdEditor however exists. this is my code: https://paste2box.com/vHQUFQ/MPSkCIdOy3Y#/W6M1j2xgD_RL51qrgS-OQ3PZuF_FeC9mNySZ-Tt2dL0/D9AD7EIl.js what am i doing wrong here?
[06:25:07] <morphyeys> taplar, okay so you have changed only the class of the first parent and nothing else?
[06:26:23] <taplar> should be the case
[06:26:42] <taplar> it was just an easy way to select the elements, but any selector that will get your parent elements will work
[06:27:57] <morphyeys> taplar, but I'll have to name the classes of the parents with different names
[06:28:24] <taplar> why?
[06:29:06] <morphyeys> taplar, because now http://jsfiddle.net/a7u1pa9v/1/ it's working only for Test and not for Something
[06:29:07] <r-ku> relevant jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/5cddgakt/ noone can see what i did wrong here?
[06:29:40] <taplar> mdEdit is not a function
[06:29:51] <taplar> you leave off the 'or' ?
[06:29:55] <taplar> mdEditor
[06:30:38] <morphyeys> taplar, ahh I need just to add a class checkList to the 2nd parent and it's working
[06:30:50] <r-ku> well thats embarrassing fail. taplar its not a problem though. corrected version still not working: http://jsfiddle.net/5cddgakt/1/
[06:30:51] <morphyeys> but how is it a parent of the rest of the checkboxes?
[06:31:07] <taplar> morphyeys: your using the value of the 'parent' to find the children
[06:31:18] <r-ku> [16:29:51] <taplar> you leave off the 'or' - not sure what that means
[06:31:21] <morphyeys> aaaa taplar parent.val :D
[06:31:23] <taplar> so whatever one is changed, it finds the realted children by it's relative value
[06:31:25] <morphyeys> omg omg
[06:31:33] <morphyeys> yes yes I see
[06:31:59] <taplar> r-ku: you created function mdEditor, but your trying to call mdEdit
[06:32:25] <r-ku> taplar please look at corrected version: http://jsfiddle.net/5cddgakt/1/
[06:32:29] <r-ku> calling mdEditor still fails
[06:32:54] <taplar> $.fn.mdEditor($('#test'));
[06:33:38] <taplar> i believe it is the case that functions added to $.fn expect to operate off of a jquery object
[06:33:45] <taplar> so like $(selector).mdEditor
[06:33:50] <taplar> not just $.mdEditor
[06:33:56] <r-ku> oh
[06:34:02] <r-ku> that makes sense then
[06:34:21] <r-ku> indeed it works. thank you very much taplar
[06:36:39] <morphyeys> taplar, thank you very much man you're gold !
[06:36:47] <taplar> :/
[06:37:30] <mrcuteo> hi
[06:37:46] <mrcuteo> how can i get value from jsonparse
[06:37:50] <mrcuteo> $('#QRCode').val(result['QRCode']);
[06:38:02] <mrcuteo> how do change this into a value?
[06:38:30] <tomatto> hi, please is possible to somehow adjust background picture to browser window to respect aspect ratio?
[06:38:39] <taplar> JSON.parse( jsonString)['QRCode'] should be valid
[06:39:04] <taplar> tomatto: that would be more of a ##css question
[06:39:16] <mrcuteo> taplar  i want to use it in if else statement
[06:39:19] <mrcuteo> how can i do tha
[06:39:33] <taplar> what do you mean?
[06:40:28] <tomatto> taplar: i thought, that it is not possible to do it with css only, to handle all situations?
[06:40:42] <mrcuteo> taplar i want to use var QRCode = $('#QRCode').val(result['QRCode']);
[06:40:59] <mrcuteo> and if(QRCode = ""){   value } else {}
[06:41:53] <taplar> == not -
[06:41:54] <taplar> =
[06:42:15] <mrcuteo> i ahve this
[06:42:17] <taplar> and val(string) returns the parent jquery object, not the value
[06:42:19] <mrcuteo> var result = $.parseJSON(data); 			$('#Session_ID2').val(result['Session_ID']);
[06:42:33] <taplar> looks right
[06:42:37] <mrcuteo> data is an array from php page
[06:43:06] <taplar> an array or a map?
[06:43:06] <mrcuteo> but how can i get the value from $('#Session_ID2').val(result['Session_ID']);
[06:43:11] <mrcuteo> array
[06:43:18] <taplar> err, sorry not map.  an associative array?
[06:43:27] <mrcuteo> $data = array(     'Session_ID' => $Session_ID, 	'QRCode' => $QRCode
[06:43:31] <taplar> yeah
[06:43:36] <mrcuteo> yerp
[06:43:59] <taplar> do a console.log() on your result and make sure its what you expect
[06:44:35] <taplar> once in the console you can click the left most Object and it will bring up a browsable version so you can see the nesting
[06:44:35] <mrcuteo> yeah
[06:46:03] <mrcuteo> but how do i get the real value of $('#Session_ID2').val(result['Session_ID']); and not the object?
[06:46:35] <taplar> either with result['Session_ID'] or $('#Session_ID2').val()
[06:47:05] <taplar> val() without input is a getter
[06:47:38] <mrcuteo> can i do: like var a =result['Session_ID']; ?
[06:47:43] <taplar> sure
[06:48:01] <taplar> you could also do var a = result.Session_ID
[06:48:07] <mrcuteo> and put in alert box alert('a') ?
[06:48:14] <mrcuteo> ic
[06:48:17] <taplar> without quotes
[06:50:12] <mrcuteo> yerp it works taplar
[06:50:19] <mrcuteo> million thanks bro :)
[06:50:23] <taplar> :)
[06:50:30] <mrcuteo> i buy you a beer if you are here in malaysia :)
[06:51:01] <taplar> does malaysia have a tropical envir?
[06:51:06] <mrcuteo> yes
[06:51:09] <mrcuteo> green forest
[06:51:16] <taplar> egh, i could do with a little less heat for now, ;)
[06:51:23] <mrcuteo> :)
[06:51:33] <mrcuteo> how bout this $("#Session_ID").val();
[06:51:46] <mrcuteo> var a = Session_ID will work?
[06:52:10] <taplar> no, in that case, your looking up an element with that id, and getting it's value
[06:52:19] <mrcuteo> ic
[06:52:31] <taplar> just in the case of objects you can do array or dot notation
[06:52:40] <taplar> object[key] == object.key
[06:53:12] <mrcuteo> okay thanks taplar very good info
[06:56:38] <taplar> tomatto: quick google search.  have you looked into background-size: cover ?
[06:56:58] <taplar> http://webdesign.about.com/od/css3tutorials/a/browser-size-cover.htm
[06:57:13] <mrcuteo> taplar can i do if else statement like this:
[06:57:17] <mrcuteo>  var a = result.Session_ID; 			 var b = $("#Session_ID").val(); 			if(a <> b){
[06:57:38] <taplar> != or !== if they're both the same type
[06:58:03] <mrcuteo> oh no <> in jquery?
[06:58:10] <taplar> not that i'm aware of
[06:58:22] <taplar> and javascript, not jquery, :)
[06:58:24] <tuja> Hi, I'm trying to use getJson, everything works. But the return data is only one object, how can I iterate over it. It looks something like this { "name": "My Name", "phone": "123456"}
[06:58:28] <mynameisbrian> Type some things, then hit backspace and type a letter.. why does it give an incorrect character count? https://jsfiddle.net/kxo8q4xm/1/
[06:58:32] <mrcuteo> :)
[06:58:36] <tuja> Can I loop over that?
[06:59:01] <taplar> tuja: Object.keys( yourElement).forEach()
[06:59:14] <taplar> tuja: or $( Object.keys( yourElement ) ).each()
[06:59:28] <taplar> afk a bit
[06:59:43] <xec> mynameisbrian: keydown happens before the character exists
[07:00:14] <tuja> taplar_afk: Thanks!
[07:00:14] <xec> mynameisbrian: try "keyup" or "input" instead
[07:01:01] <xec> mynameisbrian: i prefer "input" as it works even if you paste something using the mouse for instance
[07:01:28] <mynameisbrian> xec, I need to be able to cancel text input once a max is reached. It looks like I'm not able to do this for keyup/input.
[07:01:47] <mynameisbrian> keyup works great, but I don't know how to prevent the person from typing, except for a back space
[07:02:32] <NoiseEee> https://jsfiddle.net/kxo8q4xm/2/ @ mynameisbrian
[07:02:37] <xec> mynameisbrian: right, for that you do need keydown :)
[07:02:43] <NoiseEee> "max-length" attribute, no JS required.
[07:02:47] <tuja> Hmm, I tried what taplar_afk did suggest. Anyone who could help me how I in teh each() loop can reference the key / value?
[07:02:58] <NoiseEee> sorry, "maxlength"
[07:03:50] <mynameisbrian> oh thanks NoiseEee, that works!! I was so focused on JS that I didn't even think of doing that. thanks for the help also xec
[07:03:55] <xec> mynameisbrian: NoiseEee's solution is best really, if you care about old browsers you need a polyfill
[07:04:43] <xec> iirc IE9 and older
[07:05:21] <mynameisbrian> yeah the limit is not that important. It's for customer reviews that we want to tweet, so I was putting a 140 limit. But we'll just filter out reviews that have problems like extra characters.
[07:09:53] <mrcuteo> taplar
[07:09:59] <mrcuteo> thank man for the help
[07:10:05] <mrcuteo> i've got to go now
[07:10:16] <mrcuteo> gnite mate
[07:17:25] <taplar_afk> tuja: $( Object.keys( objectElement ) ).each(function(index, key){ console.log( objectElement[key] ); });
[07:21:49] <taplar_afk> yay meetings, *walks away*
[07:28:32] <slide> It used to work that returning falsein an onClick handler would cancel the default event right? Was that removed at some point?
[07:29:38] <slide> or is it still supposed to work?
[07:34:33] <onr> /nick carousel
[07:38:28] <mynameisbrian> slide, that should work
[07:38:42] <mynameisbrian> show us a small code portion of what you're having a problem with on jsfiddle

[07:49:13] <leptone> does anyone know a good article i can follow

[08:01:57] <herwegoagain__> how can I initialize input in select2 since Iniselection is deprecated?
[08:02:34] <Nasp> herwegoagain__: What have yo utried
[08:03:15] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: I have a dropdown with input and I want to initialize the  in this input
[08:03:24] <herwegoagain__> i want to initialize text
[08:03:27] <herwegoagain__> *
[08:03:38] <Nasp> ?
[08:03:47] <Nasp> Im not following ,and what's stopping you from initializing select2
[08:04:14] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: So how you would do this?
[08:04:31] <Nasp> I still don't udnerstand what it is you want
[08:04:38] <Nasp> I take it is to use select2
[08:04:47] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: I want to have initialize data in my input dropdown
[08:05:01] <herwegoagain__> yes I am using select2
[08:05:37] <Nasp> So initialize it .select2(); tada
[08:05:52] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: doesnt work tada
[08:06:11] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: What are you trying to do
[08:06:15] <Nasp> Sucks to be you
[08:06:28] <herwegoagain__> .select2() is initialize select2 plugin
[08:06:30] <Nasp> Im trying to save documents in a database atm
[08:06:37] <herwegoagain__> I already have that
[08:06:58] <herwegoagain__> you completely not understand what im trying to do
[08:07:08] <onr> you don't need to save them, just trust your DBMS, it will keep them safe
[08:08:40] <herwegoagain__> Nasp: Nevermind fixed it. This is how you do it $(".dropdown").select2('val','Text');
[08:08:51] <herwegoagain__> wasnt that hard
[08:09:38] <Nasp> herwegoagain__: I know
[08:09:46] <Nasp> So why didn't you try that
[08:10:00] <herwegoagain__> I already did, and you didnt want  to tell me how to do it
[08:10:19] <Nasp> You didn't tell me what you've tried
[08:10:30] <Nasp> I can't really help you with imaginary problems
[08:10:37] <herwegoagain__> Lol what a noob
[08:10:40] <herwegoagain__> bye
[08:20:53] <Zeranoe> How could I change the normal function of the enter key from submitting a form, to tabbing to the next input?
[08:22:01] <robertmaxrees> bind to the submit event and cancel it, then bind to keydown, check if it's the enter key, and focus the next input.
[08:22:09] <robertmaxrees> though i'd just let users tab through instead.
[08:24:06] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: This seems pretty straightforward, but can you think of any changes to this? http://jsfiddle.net/TnEB5/3/
[08:41:00] <DarsVaeda> nut sure this is the correct channel: I populate a datalist with jquery but it is only available after I click into the input field again, do I have to trigger something after the repopulate?
[09:20:15] <tash> I'm hoping someone else has run into this.  I'm doing a .post that works great in firefox, but in IE doesn't work b/c it seems IE is caching pages.  I want to programmatically prevent it if possible.  I've tried several things but it never seems to work unless I clear the browser cache.  Any sure fire ways to prevent IE from doing this other than changing the settings in the browser?
[09:21:15] <NoiseEee> tash: send expired headers
[09:21:16] <snover> send correct cache-control header.
[09:21:36] <tash> I'll grab what I've tried so far, b/c I think I've tried both.
[09:28:45] <tash1> shouldn't this prevent IE from caching?
[09:28:46] <tash1> http://pastie.org/10346673
[09:34:28] <tash1> NoiseEee and snover: are those correct? My pastie...
[09:34:47] <NoiseEee> tash1: in the XHR *response*
[09:35:15] <snover> also that x-ua-compatible meta tag is garbage and you should not put headers related to caching in the html document
[09:35:30] <snover> proxies will not process the html to read the headers
[09:36:25] <tash1> gotcha
[09:37:49] <tash1> NoiseEee:  Just read this on jquery's api page "Pages fetched with POST are never cached"
[09:38:11] <tash1> so, what would adding no-cache stuff to the xhr response do in this case? Doesn't sounds like it should be necessary.
[09:38:26] <snover> it would…not cache the xhr response which is exactly what you want
[09:38:48] <snover> why do you think that a cache control for your html file would control the cache for any other request that is made to other files?
[09:39:20] <tash1> erm, idk =\
[09:40:42] <tash1> sigh, I just realized that I told you wrong to begin with, it's a .get not a .post, but I'm sure the same logic applies
[09:41:36] <NoiseEee> i thiink the api mentions something about setting "cache" to false as well
[09:41:46] <NoiseEee> but in general, i have all my xhr requests send expired headers fwiw
[09:42:03] <NoiseEee> s/requests/responses
[09:42:16] <snover> only GET requests are specified by HTTP to be cacheable by default
[09:42:37] <tash1> ok, should I be using .ajax instead of .get?  Trying to find an example of how to use cache: false for .get stuff and not seeing any. Everything seems to be coming up as .ajax
[09:42:54] <taplar> get is a shorthand to ajax
[09:45:22] <taplar> so using the first version of it i believe you could use cache: false
[09:46:43] <tash1> did I put my cache: false in the right place? http://pastie.org/10346708  Doesn't seem to be working still.
[09:47:04] <taplar> no, your trying to use version 2
[09:47:32] <tash1> oh, didn't realize that.
[09:51:18] <tash1> think I got it...
[09:59:01] <Dr-007> what is a good plugin to output statistics with? i'm now using jquery sparkline. but this plugin does not give the option to show a legenda
[09:59:26] <Dr-007> legenda= show what the meaning of the x axis is in a line graph for example..
[10:09:00] <taplar> asking around.  i know we have some pie charts in one of our apps.  i just dunno which plugin it is
[10:11:37] <taplar> looks like maybe https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/
[10:26:25] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[10:26:58] <taplar> mm?
[10:27:26] <robertmaxrees> didn't get enough sleep last night, and today's shaping up to be... interesting.
[10:27:33] <taplar> cool
[10:27:41] <robertmaxrees> sure yeah that ;)
[10:27:45] <robertmaxrees> working on anything interesting?
[10:28:12] <taplar> not really.  just got done spending 9:00-11:20ish in stand ups, ipms, retros.
[10:28:22] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[10:28:27] <taplar> and now our auth server is being stupid so i have to wait for that to be resolved, :S
[10:28:41] <robertmaxrees> we combine our standups/retros/and sprint plannings into one meeting on wednesdays.
[10:29:01] <taplar> wish we'd do that
[10:30:41] <gambl0re> hey robertmatrix...
[10:30:54] <gambl0re> did you ignore me?
[10:31:20] <robertmaxrees> robertmatrix isn't in the channel right now.
[10:31:46] <gambl0re> did you ignore me?
[10:31:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:32:07] <gambl0re> cwhy
[10:32:26] <robertmaxrees> if i'm responding to you, there's your answer ;)
[10:36:54] <taplar> gambl0re: did you mean in general, or did you have a q?
[10:43:10] <jquerynoob> hi all, I have a selectmenu() UI element that is overriding the "Enter" key for its own use, is there a way to disable this?
[10:44:06] <robertmaxrees> and do what instead?
[10:44:35] <jquerynoob> I have a simple js script to bind the enter key to trigger another button
[10:44:52] <jquerynoob> right now this selectmenu() has overridden it
[10:45:47] <taplar> have you played around with adding that logic to the change or select events?
[10:46:03] <robertmaxrees> can you whip up a quick fiddle showing what you're trying to do?  because the enter key selecting stuff is a pretty normal thing to do so breaking that expectation is a bad idea.
[10:46:33] <jquerynoob> yeah gimme a min
[10:52:41] <`ULT> hi, what do you guys/ girls think works better: jsbin or jsFiddle?
[10:53:25] <taplar> i'm partial to jsfiddle.  don't know if its cause it works better.  i just like it more
[10:53:49] <`ULT> oke, so it is personal for you
[10:53:53] <taplar> sure
[10:54:28] <`ULT> jsbin is reloading the javascript automatic
[10:54:55] <`ULT> is that not a benefit you think?
[10:55:19] <taplar> could be.  dunno.  i just haven't put in enough time with jsbin to be familiar with it
[10:55:21] <sillyslux> mhh like coding in chrome devtools?
[10:55:59] <taplar> what's the interest?
[10:58:09] <jquerynoob> does jsfiddle work with jqueryUI?
[10:58:19] <jquerynoob> I cant seem to reproduce my codes :x
[10:58:22] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:58:35] <jquerynoob> i cannot even code a simple button 0.o
[10:59:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/xtr0nuLn/
[10:59:06] <robertmaxrees> upper left.
[11:03:11] <pmcgovern> Is there an easy way to access the current position when using jquery ui Sortable? (http://jqueryui.com/sortable/#default)
[11:03:32] <pmcgovern> so if Item 7 moves to position 2, possibly update the value of a hidden field
[11:04:39] <taplar> you might could do something like that in the change event
[11:05:02] <taplar> "This event is triggered during sorting, but only when the DOM position has changed."
[11:09:43] <jquerynoob> okay see this http://jsfiddle.net/jLqbtufu/
[11:10:06] <jquerynoob> I am looking for a way to disable the default keybind on jquery's selectmenu()
[11:10:22] <jquerynoob> because I already have bound "Enter" to a custom button on the same page
[11:10:50] <taplar> i don't see a selectmenu in that code
[11:11:32] <jquerynoob> err I updated it just in case, try again?
[11:12:21] <taplar> k
[11:13:14] <jquerynoob> ugh seems to be buggy, try this http://jsfiddle.net/jLqbtufu/1/
[11:15:46] <taplar> not sure yet why it's alerting twice but http://jsfiddle.net/jLqbtufu/2/
[11:17:09] <jquerynoob> interesting approach
[11:17:31] <jquerynoob> I tried to disable or close the selectmenu, but I can't get any trigger to work
[11:19:08] <ceramicskull> Is there a way to pass cart product information through a datalayer to display on another page? Is this possible with GTM?
[11:19:12] <drumer306> anyone use dataTables, wondering if i can use multiple tables to reference the same data set ( this set is static html ) and have different sorts, but update all together
[11:19:52] <jquerynoob> actually my existing "enter" keybind is to submit a form, all I need is to somehow disable selectmenu's own keybind or get it to lose focus
[11:21:00] <taplar> jquerynoob: if you disabled the selectmenu's handling of enter you would probably break it's change logic.  you'd be forcing the user to click the option they want
[11:21:52] <jquerynoob> taplar: makes sense, what I've tried so far is to force selectmenu to lose focus once the cursor leaves it, with no luck thus far
[11:22:28] <jquerynoob> taplar: currently I have to make an extra click outside the selectmenu to make it lose focus, then my original enter keybind works again
[11:23:51] <jquerynoob> taplar: curiously, I cannot even get any trigger to work with selectmenu, mouseenter/leave/on/off all don't wanna play ball with selectmenu :(
[11:25:48] <styks1987> can I find by data attribute on parsed html?
[11:26:44] <jquerynoob> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/jLqbtufu/3/ I made a simple mouseleave trigger on the selectmenu, but no dice
[11:27:40] <taplar> part of your issue is that what your seeing is not dropdown1
[11:27:57] <taplar> the visual element your seeing is dropdown1-button and dropdown1-menu
[11:28:57] <jquerynoob> ohhhhh
[11:29:18] <jquerynoob> okay cool, I got the trigger to work, I'll now try to use it to close or disable to selectmenu on mouseout
[11:29:50] <jquerynoob> btw where did you get that from? I didnt see it in the docs
[11:30:00] <taplar> right click, inspect element, :P
[11:30:14] <leptone> does anyone know how to configure jQuery in meteor
[11:30:16] <jquerynoob> sigh, curse you jquery documentation
[11:30:32] <leptone> I'm getting
[11:30:33] <leptone> Error: Cannot find module 'jquery'
[11:30:45] <taplar> styks1987: you can find elements by their attributes, but it's not really recommended
[11:31:34] <taplar> styks1987: probably better to find by the tag/class and then filter by the attribute
[11:32:01] <Daiben> hi
[11:33:04] <LindsayMac> Is there a way to rebind an event as soon as a json request is received?
[11:33:20] <taplar> why would you want to rebind?
[11:33:49] <LindsayMac> I'm having a strange result where my select2 input form is being unbind'ed when I select a new option value. I am assuming it's happning immediately after the resutls from the JSON object are sent and retrieved
[11:34:31] <LindsayMac> I haven't been able to replicate in a JSFiddle just yet because the responses are all coming from backbone.js which is a big giant pile of spaghetti right now
[11:35:39] <LindsayMac> but when I follow the code, I am able to see that I select an <option> and it's value is sent via ajax to my data save function and then the <option> element is added to <select> (as per select2 wants)
[11:36:00] <taplar> k, to make sure i understand.  your saying when you select a 'new option', previously existing elements that had an event bound no longer have their event bound?  or are you saying new elements added to the page are not bound yet?
[11:36:53] <LindsayMac> taplar: when I select a new option the entire <input> element that I have select2 bound is unbind'ed
[11:37:26] <LindsayMac> as soon as the <option> is added to the <select> it seems that select2 unbinds (basically all of the select2 markup is gone)
[11:37:42] <LindsayMac> if I make a button that rebinds select2 to that element on click, it all vcomes back
[11:37:49] <LindsayMac> i can make a screencast really quick.. one sec.
[11:38:03] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be even better ;)
[11:38:44] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  like i said earlier.. I have't been able to replicate it in a fiddle http://cl.ly/302V0I142V07
[11:38:51] <LindsayMac> oops taplar for you http://cl.ly/302V0I142V07
[11:39:58] <taplar> i'll have to defer on this one.  i'm not very familiar with select2
[11:40:25] <taplar> i'd need to see some code to trudge through
[11:40:27] <LindsayMac> taplar: well.. i mean, this probably could be true for anything that binds to an element, no?
[11:40:43] <LindsayMac> I can show you my select2 code that has the ajax..
[11:40:46] <taplar> unless you do something to it, elements should not lose their bindings
[11:41:30] <LindsayMac> taplar:  well yea. thats why im here asking.
[11:42:02] <LindsayMac> taplar:  Does it make sense for something to unbind when an ajax function is complete?
[11:42:07] <taplar> no
[11:42:10] <LindsayMac> the page definitely does not refresh
[11:42:20] <taplar> unless the object that was bound to was replaced
[11:42:36] <taplar> or did not originally exist when the binding was attempted
[11:42:46] <LindsayMac> like reloaded in the DOM?
[11:42:52] <taplar> yes
[11:42:58] <`ULT> hi can someone check rule: if ($('input.toggle-options').is(':checked')) { and tell me why it is not working like i think i should?
[11:43:05] <LindsayMac> taplar:  here is the select2 code http://pastebin.com/t7D6aeue
[11:43:12] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/1/
[11:45:52] <taplar> which element is it your saying is no longer bound?
[11:47:08] <jquerynoob> taplar: I managed to get it working! using the correct selectors I managed to get it blurred :D
[11:47:13] <jquerynoob> thanks much!
[11:47:20] <taplar> cool
[11:47:51] <jquerynoob> to be on the safe side, all browsers should modify the selectmenu IDs the same way right? ie #dropdown1-button?
[11:47:55] <LindsayMac> taplar: the #ee
[11:51:20] <taplar> well, one thing that is kinda concerning is your doing your select2 initialization on every click of one of those elements
[11:54:19] <LindsayMac> taplar:  yea so basically because this is content inside of a modal, and each modal's frame is loading straight out of nowhere (inputs are created on the fly) I wanted to trigger the init of the script every time the view changed.
[11:54:47] <`ULT> hi taplar, do you have some hints to how i can debug this line: if ($('input.toggle-options').is(':checked')) {
[11:54:55] <`ULT> in: https://jsfiddle.net/8worawe9/1/ ?
[11:55:28] <`ULT> if it gives true or false
[11:55:29] <LindsayMac> So the first time is to bind the select element when you first open the modal. Then I bind it each different possible way that the views can change because once you are in a different view the select element drops out of the DOM
[11:55:33] <LindsayMac> taplar:  does that make sense
[11:55:57] <taplar> one sec
[11:57:10] <taplar> `ULT: your two tags with that class are a span and an input field.  neither can really be 'checked'
[11:57:21] <taplar> * input text
[11:57:54] <`ULT> $("input.toggle-options").replaceWith('<input type="checkbox" name="checkbox" value="1" class="toggle-options">');
[11:58:07] <taplar> oh right
[11:58:09] <taplar> gah
[11:58:10] <taplar> lol
[11:58:17] <`ULT> :p
[12:00:27] <taplar> you should probably limit your selector to select input[type="checkbox"]
[12:00:29] <LindsayMac> Uhkis:  if ($('input.toggle-options').val(1))
[12:00:37] <LindsayMac> oops `ULT if ($('input.toggle-options').val(1))
[12:00:44] <taplar> and also your replace is not defaulting any to checked so they all are probably coming back false
[12:01:02] <LindsayMac> `ULT:  thats not really complete code, but you arent using checkboxes but you're updating your value to 1
[12:02:01] <LindsayMac> or you SHOULD be updating the value from 0 to 1 on check.
[12:02:02] <`ULT> lindsay, i want only check if the checkbox is pressed, not if the value is 1
[12:02:21] <taplar> your wanting to create an event on change?
[12:02:26] <taplar> cause that's different
[12:02:30] <`ULT> what i want is the following
[12:02:50] <`ULT> this is a first step for me because what i want is to complex for me right know :p
[12:03:10] <LindsayMac> `ULT: what i'm saying is that you should update the value of the <input> field to 1 when you click the checkbox
[12:03:24] <`ULT> I want running this code:    var sum = 0;
[12:03:25] <`ULT>         selects.each(function () {
[12:03:25] <`ULT>             sum += +$(this).find("option:selected").data("price");
[12:03:42] <`ULT> only for the rows where the checkbox is checked
[12:04:10] <`ULT> and not for the options where the checkbox is not checked
[12:04:44] <LindsayMac> `ULT: you're going to have to go through each input and check if it's checked
[12:04:54] <taplar> ok, well your replacing them all with unchecked checkboxes
[12:05:04] <taplar> so that if is not going to be true
[12:05:37] <`ULT> but when i check the checkbox is it is checked, doesn`t it?
[12:05:50] <`ULT> *isn`t
[12:05:57] <taplar> yep, but that logic would need to be handled in an event handler
[12:06:04] <`ULT> oow
[12:06:05] <`ULT> yes
[12:06:06] <`ULT> true
[12:06:07] <`ULT> mistake
[12:06:12] <`ULT> on a click handler or something
[12:06:17] <taplar> change
[12:06:21] <`ULT> my fault
[12:06:22] <`ULT> thank you
[12:06:25] <`ULT> i will trie again
[12:06:28] <`ULT> *try
[12:07:16] <taplar> alright, back to Lindsay.  you said change view
[12:07:25] <LindsayMac> taplar:  thanks :)
[12:07:26] <`ULT> thanks LindsayMac, thats the next step when I have the simple if ready :p
[12:08:12] <taplar> when you say change view, what is involved with that?  complete page reload, or ajax partial changes of internal containers?
[12:08:46] <pmcgovern> anyone used jquery ui sortable before?
[12:08:51] <LindsayMac> taplar:  ajax partial changes. The structure of this content is built with backbone using MVC
[12:09:10] <afroradiohead> can you name html tags whatever you want?
[12:09:21] <taplar> afroradiohead: sure
[12:09:44] <afroradiohead> I don't see the web doing that often
[12:09:46] <taplar> LindsayMac: so the id="ee" element.  does that get loaded into the page only once?
[12:10:06] <LindsayMac> taplar:  it gets reloaded if I switch "views"
[12:10:10] <afroradiohead> like: <bottomPanel>, would that be bad for some browsers?
[12:10:20] <taplar> oh!
[12:10:21] <taplar> no no
[12:10:25] <LindsayMac> taplar:  so if I click on the next thumbnail in the grid, it will reload #ee
[12:10:29] <taplar> that's not a tag name, well
[12:10:39] <taplar> when you say tag name i think <tag name="something"
[12:10:44] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead: no you can not do that.. you can do <div id="bottomPanel">
[12:10:47] <taplar> but no, tags are predefined for the most part
[12:10:57] <afroradiohead> dang
[12:10:59] <LindsayMac> taplar: there are HTML5 tags that are more semantic
[12:11:01] <afroradiohead> good ol html
[12:11:18] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  that would be ridiculous.. it would make it no better than XML with their ridiculous name your tags whatever you want
[12:11:24] <taplar> you'd do something like LindsayMac said with the div
[12:11:37] <afroradiohead> LindsayMac: is xxml that bad??
[12:11:46] <afroradiohead> naming-structure wise
[12:12:08] <taplar> LindsayMac: ok, if that element is being reloaded for each view change, then that would be why it's losing it's binding
[12:12:20] <LindsayMac> taplar: So the select2 field does NOT loose it's bind if I remove the ajax save function.. this only happens (loose the bind) when the ajax save function happens.. but from what I can tell, the ajax save function does NOT reload the field
[12:12:51] <LindsayMac> taplar:  but I'm not loosing it's bind on view changes because I have that sorted with all those .on() elements
[12:13:15] <LindsayMac> taplar:  its only loosing the bind when the save function is run. The save is an ajax save
[12:13:42] <taplar> i don't see the save in your code snipplet
[12:14:36] <taplar> and i'm going to have to defer you to some one else for a moment.  finally have access to my environment again so I have to do some codin, :)
[12:15:09] <LindsayMac> taplar: So save action is in the backbone views which is processed in PHP
[12:18:30] <afroradiohead> yeah i've always wondered why the html creators decided on divs instead of custom names
[12:18:45] <afroradiohead> <sidebar> would be tight
[12:19:18] <afroradiohead> when people look at your html it'd be faster and more accurate of a read
[12:22:50] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead: because custom names are a nightmare
[12:23:08] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  and no it wouldnt be faster. Thats why we have id="sidebar"
[12:23:10] <afroradiohead> yeah? we do it with classes all the time
[12:23:29] <afroradiohead> hmm.. it wouldn't be faster?
[12:23:37] <NoiseEee> there is <aside> though yeah?
[12:24:04] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  no.. because then you have to make sure to define what the actual PURPOSE is..is it block level? inline? is it a layout element or a text formatting one
[12:24:07] <afroradiohead> right, there's a bunch of tags the w3 decides for us :(
[12:24:11] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  that is the absolute purpose of IDs
[12:24:34] <afroradiohead> you wouldn't be able to do the above with custom tags?
[12:24:38] <snover> wut
[12:24:49] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  and the reason they made new tags is because they serve certain purposes in layouts. Your naming convention isnt about purpose. its just content
[12:25:04] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  if you had custom tags it would be a nightmare.
[12:25:24] <afroradiohead> hmm
[12:25:25] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  there would be zero actual structure and reading the DOM of something with randomly named tags would cause massive heaadaches
[12:25:53] <LindsayMac> the few we have all serve purposes on the page.
[12:25:54] <afroradiohead> it'd be a headache? I don't see how
[12:26:08] <LindsayMac> then you havent done very much front end work, have you?
[12:26:13] <afroradiohead> It's like having json key-value pairs
[12:26:18] <afroradiohead> yeah i do all the time
[12:26:19] <LindsayMac> afroradiohead:  no... not at all
[12:26:28] <LindsayMac> forget it. this is a ridiculous conversation..
[12:26:40] <afroradiohead> yeah, it probably is
[12:26:50] <afroradiohead> thanks for entertaining it though
[12:26:52] <LindsayMac> if anyone is around to give me some hands with how to rebind an element to my function i would hugely appreciate it
[12:27:03] <LindsayMac> i definitely did not entertain the idea at all...
[12:27:14] <afroradiohead> ah
[12:29:15] <afroradiohead> btw, do you mean changing what "this" is in your function?
[12:29:50] <afroradiohead> LindsayMac ^
[12:34:09] <LindsayMac> huh?
[12:34:51] <afroradiohead> you're trying to rebind an element? There's two types of binds. jQuery.bind and the javascrip's bind
[12:35:26] <afroradiohead> the first rebinds an event to the element, the second changes the context of "this"
[12:35:32] <afroradiohead> were you trying to do the first or second?
[12:41:09] <robertmaxrees> aaaah lunch
[12:41:48] <Dr-007> taplar, thanks
[12:55:45] <Izacht13> Can someone give me a hand? I`m new to JS and jQuery, and I'm trying to get a Trello board onto my site. http://hastebin.com/odejubocor.coffee This code doesnt seem to be working.
[13:03:56] <afroradiohead> lzacht13: http://hastebin.com/zigisuxole.js - check the difference
[13:04:24] <afroradiohead> dunno if it'll run but that's more along the lines of what you want
[13:04:53] <Izacht13> Mhm
[13:07:59] <mvpgraff> Is there a way to show the exact error of a field based on the requirements using jquery validation? Example: password requries capital, lowercase and number, but person is missing a number - can it tell the user to add the number?
[13:08:34] <afroradiohead> mvpgraff: are you using a validation plugin?
[13:08:48] <mvpgraff> yea the jquery validation plugin
[13:09:10] <afroradiohead> can you post the docs
[13:09:40] <mvpgraff> afroradiohead: http://jqueryvalidation.org/Validator.showErrors
[13:09:45] <Izacht13> afroradioheads: I`m using alert to show the contents of the array I`m getting from the json, and everything in it is just "object Object" does that mean its just an array filled with null objects? Or is it just printing the type?
[13:09:47] <mvpgraff> that's all it shows me t.t
[13:10:27] <afroradiohead> Izacht13 the latter
[13:11:02] <afroradiohead> mvpgraff: got a sample of your code?
[13:16:39] <mvpgraff> afroradiohead: http://jsfiddle.net/nLnpw8eL/
[13:17:42] <afroradiohead> kk checkig it out
[13:23:29] <afroradiohead> mvpgraff: nope doesnn't look like this plugin lets you generate specific errors messages based on what type of error an input has.. at least I don't see it
[13:24:14] <afroradiohead> http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod
[13:24:44] <afroradiohead> I do see you can make your own validation methods with it's ownn custom errors, chances are you'll have to copy the logic and set your own errors
[13:25:12] <afroradiohead> copy the logic* of each type of validation you want to change the error message for
[13:26:20] <mvpgraff> Yea, that's what I was wondering, the effort for this went to 10 because there is more important stuff to take care of lol
[13:36:23] <rashkov> ajaxComplete doesn't fire when the server response contains a malformed body. Instead I get an unhandled application error which I can't do anything with. Any advice? The error is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input" which I believe comes from parseJSON
[13:37:07] <rashkov> the "malformed body" in this case is simply blank, no characters. So it's not entirely as simple as getting upstream to fix it. I'd like to be able to handle that case.
[13:53:25] <shoky> rashkov: then don't call parseJSON or don't use a json dataType
[13:53:47] <KEHN> hi
[13:54:58] <rashkov> shoky: I think it's the server that sets the json dataType. There's an argument here to be had over whether to blame the web server or not, but the fact that ajaxComplete doesn't fire seems like a failure of jQuery to gracefully handle the error.
[13:55:09] <rashkov> content-type rather, not dataType
[13:55:18] <KEHN> i wish to make elements drag and droppable, i am using bootstrap and jquery. any recommended approach?
[13:55:28] <KEHN> use or don't use jquery UI draggable ?
[13:55:30] <rashkov> KEHN: jqueryui has a draggable and droppable thing
[13:55:47] <shoky> rashkov: well the server is to blame for reporting a wrong content-type, but you can have jquery treat it as raw/text  by setting dataType: 'text'
[13:56:16] <KEHN> is the jquery ui draggable recommended?
[13:57:07] <rashkov> shoky: that's a good suggestion, thanks.
[13:57:51] <rashkov> KEHN: I've used it and it works well.
[13:58:43] <KEHN> my only issue was having another library fot the user to download
[13:59:25] <KEHN> but i guess i can custom DL the library to contain the draggable only
[14:01:19] <NoiseEee> does a 500 server response trigger the .fail() callback on an $.ajax call?
[14:01:26] <NoiseEee> anyone know off hand?
[14:02:12] <shoky> NoiseEee it does i believe yeah
[14:02:27] <shoky> isSuccess = status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304;
[14:03:34] <rashkov> KEHN: I'm seeing that HTML5 supports drag and drop natively
[14:03:52] <NoiseEee> thanks shoky
[14:13:20] <thinkeyP> Hey! I'm having trouble with my persistent toolbars which are refreshing each time I navigate to a new page.
[14:13:24] <rashkov> KEHN: www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/
[14:13:26] <thinkeyP> Can I pastebin my code here?
[14:13:40] <thinkeyP> Im using jquery mobile
[14:15:01] <KEHN> hey again
[14:15:27] <KEHN> haha i was reading that earlier
[14:15:30] <KEHN> thanks though
[14:15:40] <KEHN> it started with that then thought about jquery UI
[14:16:00] <KEHN> which method would you choose? am thinking UI now
[14:16:27] <thinkeyP> http://jsbin.com/rocuxowiga/edit?html,output
[14:16:29] <thinkeyP> any ideas?
[14:17:15] <wfq> hi guys
[14:17:47] <KEHN> hi
[14:17:58] <wfq> is there anyway to check whether a textarea's html is well formed? All that I need to know is whether all html tags are closed
[14:18:00] <rashkov> KEHN: well, if you have to support older browsers then you'll want jQuery UI for compatibility reasons. Otherwise the HTML5 approach will mean no extra libraries.
[14:18:53] <KEHN> old old are not that important tbh
[14:18:58] <KEHN> just wondering from a learning pov
[14:19:05] <KEHN> prob best to do it without UI
[14:19:21] <KEHN> but for boostrap site with jquery, why not use jquery ui
[14:19:41] <wfq> any idea?
[14:19:50] <rashkov> KEHN: yeah they're both cool
[14:20:17] <rashkov> wfq: I'd check out jQuery.parseXML and see what kind of errors that throws and if you can handle them
[14:21:05] <rashkov> wfq: try{ jQuery.parseXML("<foo>")} catch(err){ console.log('hey'); }
[14:21:05] <wfq> rashkov genius, that's all I need. Thanks
[14:22:02] <rashkov> wfq: np. I got the idea from here, which is a classic and hilarious answer on Stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags
[14:24:04] <thinkeyP> Anyone have a hint about what's wrong with the header/footer here?  http://jsbin.com/rocuxowiga/edit?html,output
[14:28:03] <pmcgovern> jqueryui sortable - I am sorting sections of a form and want to access and update the value of a field within the element that was sorted. ui.item.(.classNameOfField) is not working - how can I do this?
[14:28:15] <pmcgovern> reference: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update
[14:29:55] <shoky> pmcgovern: http://api.jquery.com/find/
[14:30:12] <shoky> ui.item.find('.classname')
[14:30:34] <shoky> ui.item.(.classNameOfField)  is not javascript
[14:31:24] <rashkov> thinkeyP: what specifically?
[14:32:21] <pmcgovern> shoky, you are my hero
[14:36:09] <pmcgovern> shoky - know how I can loop through all 'sortable' elements and update a hidden field value based on their current index placement?
[14:38:02] <pmcgovern> var i = 0; for each (element in #sortable.li) { element.find('.hidden_field').val(i); i++; }  ?
[14:40:39] <thinkeyP> rashkov : the footer and header is refreshing when changing page (in the footer)
[14:41:12] <thinkeyP> change page from "kompass" to "prognos" and look at the footer
[14:45:33] <shoky> pmcgovern:  $('#sortable li .hidden_field').val(function(i) { return i })
[14:46:04] <pmcgovern> shoky: how about $('.ui-state-default').each(function(i,e) { $(e).find('.sequence').val(i); } ?
[14:46:23] <pmcgovern> that seems to be updating all fields with new sequence correctly
[14:46:25] <shoky> pmcgovern: that's ok too
[14:46:30] <pmcgovern> woo!
[14:46:53] <shoky> though would be better to use your own class instead of ui-state-default
[14:47:07] <pmcgovern> noted
[14:48:26] <thinkeyP> rashkov : do you see it? :/
[15:00:38] <thinkeyP> Why is the header change to white background color for a second in the transition?
[15:13:10] <shoky> thinkeyP: because the page is fading out
[15:15:32] <thinkeyP> shoky : hm okey
[15:15:36] <thinkeyP> is it possible to fix?
[15:15:50] <thinkeyP> i guess i've implemented it wrong somehow
[15:16:17] <thinkeyP> It's not fading in this example: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/toolbar-fixed-persistent/
[15:16:18] <shoky> thinkeyP: what do you want to happen
[15:16:55] <shoky> thinkeyP: right it's flipping instead of fading because they put  data-transition="flip" on the links
[15:16:58] <thinkeyP> when pushing a button in the footer, it should only change page without fading/refreshing the footer and header
[15:17:13] <shoky> thinkeyP: $.mobile.defaultPageTransition = 'none';
[15:17:23] <thinkeyP> but i want the footer and header to be same/persistent on all pages
[15:18:38] <thinkeyP> look at this again: http://jsbin.com/rocuxowiga/edit?html,output
[15:18:51] <thinkeyP> switch between "Prognos" and "Karta"
[15:19:04] <thinkeyP> you'll see some glitch with the "Prognos"-button
[15:19:19] <thinkeyP> And the header becomes white...
[15:19:35] <shoky> thinkeyP:  http://jsbin.com/cevizefebu/1/edit?html,output  here it's without transitions
[15:20:38] <shoky> thinkeyP: and the glitch is because some of the pages don't have a scrollbar
[15:20:46] <thinkeyP> wow
[15:20:59] <thinkeyP> that seems to work!
[15:21:09] <shoky> https://api.jquerymobile.com/global-config/
[15:21:40] <shoky> and http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/transitions/#Globalconfiguration
[15:26:58] <thinkeyP> shoky : Is it possible to use transitions somehow?
[15:27:45] <thinkeyP> without the header changing bg-color to white etc
[15:27:46] <shoky> thinkeyP: you can change 'none' to 'flip'  or whatever transition you want instead of the fade
[15:27:53] <thinkeyP> ok ill try it
[15:29:09] <thinkeyP> all transitions except "none" makes the footer and header look wierd during the animation
[15:30:13] <shoky> thinkeyP it looks weird in that example you gave too :P
[15:34:05] <thinkeyP> hehe yep
[15:34:16] <thinkeyP> i guess i'll have to skip the transitions then :P

[16:05:31] <stallmen> how should i learn jquery
[16:16:42] <robertmaxrees> stallmen learn.jquery.com is a pretty good place to start.
[17:27:57] <KEHN> hi
[17:33:37] <onr> KEHN: hi. bienvenue mi #jquery. the official IRC channel of jquery programming language
[17:33:51] <onr> s/mi/a/
[17:40:16] <snover> i know this is difficult to understand or believe but jquery is a javascript library, not a programming language
[17:41:18] <KEHN> it states that in the first part of the documentation
[17:41:44] <snover> which documentation is that?
[17:41:48] <KEHN> the jquery api
[17:42:27] <snover> where, specifically, does it say that jquery is a programming language?
[17:42:40] <KEHN> it says its a library
[17:43:10] <KEHN> so its not hard to believe
[18:28:23] <KEHN> hi hi
[18:29:31] <snover> /join #freenode
[18:29:43] <snover> barf. thanks invisible characters.
[18:39:46] <ashgotti> Hello all. I'm hitting a wall trying to figure out how to "undo". I have a select field that based on the selection adds the value of the preceeding text field to another field. The problem is that I don't know how to "undo" the adding if the user selects one option then changes their mind.
[18:54:16] <ashgotti> You can see an example here: http://jsfiddle.net/ep3cgdpk/ 1. Enter a balance (notice that Payments Remaining calculates on blur). 2. Select a different Payoff method and notice the values change. 3. Select another Payoff method and my "undo" doesn't work
[20:08:27] <undergod> hi guys! Please help me: I have this function http://hastebin.com/uqukiwubey.coffee that sort the <li> elements by text. However, the '+' character at the beginning appears first than '@', which i dont want. I want to @ be sortable first than +. Can you help me with that?
[20:32:28] <pu239> any of you use chosen? I've never used until today and I have a dropdown at the bottom of the page that's being cutoff. It's being caused by a toolbar on the bottom that I'm not sure I can mess with.
[20:33:42] <pu239> So, I'm changing margin-top on the Chosen element on the click event, which would work great except that about half the time it clicks an item in the list
[20:33:47] <pu239> Any suggestions?
