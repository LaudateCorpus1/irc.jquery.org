[00:00:06] <Whirl3d> whereas john.speaking==mary.speaking? would be true if they were both speaking or both not speaking
[00:01:22] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Excellent.  What's a way that I can replace -=6 with -=[number of people speaking]?
[00:01:46] <Whirl3d> if the health goes down by 1 per speaker, sure.
[00:02:17] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: That's the idea.  That it's more detrimental to all shout over one another than for one person to clear his throat at another,
[00:03:50] <Whirl3d> In jquery, you could add a class to your "speaker" element that indicated whether or not the person was speaking. Then, to figure out who all is speaking, just filter by that class:
[00:04:16] <Whirl3d> $(".speakers.speaking").length will tell you how many speakers are speaking
[00:04:51] <IdleWarship> FLIPPIN' AWESOME.
[00:05:11] <Whirl3d> $(".speakers") would be your base class for your elements and then once they start to speak, you would say $("#john").addClass("speaking");
[00:05:28] <Whirl3d> when he stopped speaking, you would say $("#john").removeClass("speaking");
[00:07:14] <Whirl3d> But maybe you would want to use 2 to the (number of speakers) power to come up with your rate of health decay...that way if 2 people were talking, their health would go down by a factor of 4, whereas 3 people talking would go down by 8
[00:07:31] <Whirl3d> the more people, the worse (exponentially) your health would drop
[00:08:16] <imakewebthings> If nothing else this is an interesting use of gamification to promote civilized behaviour
[00:08:27] <IdleWarship> var iration = $(".speakers.speaking").length
[00:08:42] <IdleWarship> if (adam.speaking && benj.speaking) {adam.health -= 2^iration; benj.health -= 2^iration;}
[00:09:04] <rickup> Hello.  I have a Select that shows a [Plan1, (-$50] ]   or [Plan 2,+ $74]  it is edit-attributes-43 and has several values for these different priced options.  The code I am using adds this features to this Attribute/Option as well as many many more.  Can  someone point me in the right direction to strip out everything after (and including) the comma?  So I left with [Plan1] and no prices?
[00:09:09] <IdleWarship> Wait, but that's not using $(".speakers.")
[00:09:15] <IdleWarship> So, I have to figure that out, first.
[00:09:46] <Whirl3d> $(".speaking").each(function () {$(this).data("health")-=2^$(".speaking").length;});
[00:09:48] <IdleWarship> imakewebthings: Yay, civility!
[00:10:02] <rickup> typo  sorry - should be [Plan1, (-$50) ]   or [Plan 2,+ $74]  the [] represent the select menu but the () do show up for subtractions i.e. the minus sign  -
[00:11:40] <rickup> this  edit-attributes-43  will never change so it is safe to use that as a selector and as of right now the options wont change but they may just get 1 or 2 more in the future
[00:12:13] <Whirl3d> var str=source.substr(0,source.indexOf(","))+"]";
[00:12:14] <imakewebthings> something like $(yourOptionSelector).each(function() { $(this).text($(this).text().split(',')[0]); }); ???
[00:12:28] <imakewebthings> ^ that works too
[00:12:54] <imakewebthings> and probably faster
[00:13:02] <imakewebthings> stick with Whirl3d
[00:13:21] <Whirl3d> they are basically the same thing...really.
[00:13:46] <imakewebthings> if theres only one comma, then yea
[00:13:54] <rickup> yep only one
[00:14:02] <Whirl3d> Got ya.
[00:14:27] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Does the $ selector refer to a <div> object?
[00:14:44] <Whirl3d> depends on how you have it setup.
[00:15:00] <rickup> I am nearly jQuery illiterate can I get a little more help as in do I just make one script tag and include it in this page template?
[00:15:17] <Whirl3d> How do you want to represent the people? Images? Divs? List items?
[00:16:05] <rickup> and how so I make sure not to touch the others, just this  edit-attributes-43
[00:16:16] <Whirl3d> You could setup an unordered list of speakers. Then in each list item, have a div with a paragraph that you can have their name in), and another div that can represent the health by size.
[00:17:11] <Whirl3d> var speaker=$("li.speaker"); var health=speaker.find(".healthbar").width()/maxWidth;
[00:17:33] <Whirl3d> then health would be a percentage (or ratio, really) of the speaker's health
[00:23:32] <rickup> I had some other attempt to deal with older problem I solved elsewhere so I am trying to re-use this script http://jsfiddle.net/v2D6M/
[00:24:58] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Actually, people are represented by streaming video windows...
[00:25:38] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Using tokbox api.  I'll eventually do away with the video element, but first the health bar.
[00:29:22] <Whirl3d> idleWarship, gimme a second and I'll show you what I am talking about...brb
[00:35:52] <rickup> I am trying the other one with less clutter from the previous one
[00:35:53] <rickup> http://jsfiddle.net/v2D6M/1/
[00:35:58] <rickup> AmI even close?
[00:39:14] <cloudpopup> hey guys, is there a way i can print out an object for debug purposes? so i can see all the properties it has and their values
[00:40:58] <imakewebthings> console.log?
[00:41:28] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/dhDwU/14/
[00:41:39] <Whirl3d> idleWarship ^^
[00:41:59] <cloudpopup> imakewebthings: no where, but how to extract the information from an object
[00:42:00] <imakewebthings> ?g console.log
[00:42:01] <bot-t1> imakewebthings, Firebug and Logging : Firebug - http://getfirebug.com/logging
[00:42:02] <Whirl3d> You would change the button out for your api call that checked the vox levels.
[00:42:10] <imakewebthings> ?mdc console.log
[00:42:14] <bot-t1> imakewebthings, extIConsole - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Toolkit_API/extIConsole
[00:42:20] <Whirl3d> and change your interval, etc.
[00:42:21] <imakewebthings> hrm
[00:42:57] <imakewebthings> cloudpopup: in the webkit inspector console the object is a collapsable tree
[00:43:22] <cloudpopup> would like to have it programatically as well :-)
[00:43:25] <cloudpopup> for logging purposes, etc
[00:43:33] <imakewebthings> cloudpopup: and in firebug for that matter, and dragonfly or whatever other inspector
[00:45:09] <imakewebthings> don't know what you need to know if you already know how to access objects and their properties
[00:45:10] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: WHO ARE YOU?
[00:45:32] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: I mean, I am forever indebted to you for introducing me to jsfiddle ALONE.
[00:49:41] <rickup> I can actually (I think( read this and it looks like it should work but it is not http://jsfiddle.net/v2D6M/2/
[00:53:25] <imakewebthings> cloudpopup lmgtfy http://stackoverflow.com/questions/957537/how-can-i-print-a-javascript-object
[00:53:47] <rickup> I think I see the option value of that attribute is what contains these commas and prices
[00:54:30] <imakewebthings> I'd go with the JSON.stringify option personally
[00:56:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/dhDwU/22/
[00:57:24] <cloudpopup> thanks
[00:57:37] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: What's the difference between 14 and 22? Are those versions?
[00:57:51] <Whirl3d> yes
[00:58:12] <Whirl3d> 22 lets the speakers regain health when they shut up
[00:58:45] <Whirl3d> and it runs smoother because it only has to call one interval function. The other method called one for each speaker and would get messy after a while.
[00:58:54] <Whirl3d> I have to go, but that should get you started.
[00:59:10] <IdleWarship> Whirl3d: Thanks a whole heck of a ton.
[00:59:29] <rickup> How can I use $("#edit-attributes-43").each(function() { $(this).text($(this).text().split(',')[0]); });  to "remove" every unwanted character from each option within  the select #edit-attributes-43 or is supposed to do that?
[01:00:38] <imakewebthings> $('#edit-attributes-43 option')
[01:03:05] <Whirl3d> gnite all.
[01:03:17] <rickup> night
[01:05:44] <rickup> ok I removed the document.ready & used this 	$("#edit-attributes-43 option").each(function() { $(this).text($(this).text().split(',')[0]); });  within <script> tags but its not working  the comma and prices etc still show up
[01:06:28] <imakewebthings> why did you remove the doc.ready
[01:07:04] <imakewebthings> rickup: jsfiddle.net
[01:08:40] <rickup> http://jsfiddle.net/v2D6M/3/
[01:09:13] <rickup> I out it back but I am uncertain if I close it correctly - was just trying to rule that out
[01:09:54] <rickup> I Put the doc.ready back bit that was specifically for another function I no longer need
[01:10:43] <rickup> Do you want to see the entire HTML ?
[01:10:59] <rickup> or the form at least (it is large)
[01:11:09] <rickup> or this select at least?
[01:12:00] <rickup> I should have mentioned the comma and prices only appear when the select is popped open
[01:12:11] <rickup> thats probably an issue
[01:12:12] <rickup> sorry
[01:15:28] <defunct> hello, what's the best way to show an ajax response as it comes in? Say a PHP loop is echoing out numbers
[01:15:51] <defunct> so I can print them as they come up, like 1...2...3
[01:17:52] <rickup> This may help http://jsfiddle.net/v2D6M/5/
[01:18:11] <rickup> or I can take the .htpasswd off and show it to you
[01:21:05] <imakewebthings> rickup: http://jsfiddle.net/imakewebthings/v2D6M/6/
[01:23:28] <imakewebthings> defunct: something something multipart/form-data something
[01:23:30] <rickup> imakewebthings, that actually did not work yet either the site is http://easywaas.com/locations/century-city-virtual-office
[01:24:17] <imakewebthings> sweet auth screen
[01:24:34] <imakewebthings> rickup: it works in the fiddle right?
[01:24:55] <rickup> yes actually
[01:25:20] <rickup> sorry I didnt even check I took the code and tried it onthe site
[01:25:32] <rickup> thats a good a node as any htpasswd username is guest password is lockout
[01:26:43] <rickup> yeah you like that - I did not write the copy its a long story involving paranoia, perceived lost sales etc etc
[01:30:43] <imakewebthings> rickup: that code at the bottom isn't inside a script tag
[01:30:52] <imakewebthings> i took it out of a script tag in the fiddle because you dont need it in the fiddle
[01:30:59] <imakewebthings> that whole box is inside a script tag automatically
[01:31:17] <rickup> doh
[01:33:31] <rickup> ok I missed that sorry now with script tags you can view source on the node but still not working for me
[01:36:18] <rickup> so like I was saying before you caught my rookie copy & paste mistake,   Note: I am stuck using jquery 1.3.2 but in jsfiddle your code still works
[01:36:38] <imakewebthings> even in 1.3.2
[01:36:39] <imakewebthings> ?
[01:37:17] <rickup> yep I choose jQuery 1.3.2 on the left
[01:37:21] <imakewebthings> neat
[01:37:23] <rickup> and your code still works
[01:37:33] <rickup> but only on jsfiddle
[01:37:41] <rickup> not the site yet
[01:39:20] <rickup> I am using minified?  its all on one line.  Is that what jsfiddle uses?  I have seen rare cases where if I switch to some full jquery vs. min something will work
[01:40:17] <imakewebthings> its basically impossible for me to debug your live page
[01:40:34] <imakewebthings> but i'll try a couple things
[01:40:58] <rickup> I can link the sites/all/themes/colourise/jquery.tpl.php so somewhere else its just that function
[01:41:16] <rickup> so if you have a URL I can replace my include
[01:41:36] <rickup> and you can work in the script elsewhere if you like
[01:53:47] <v0lZy> hello
[01:54:26] <v0lZy> I have a question regarding animating the height of a div
[01:54:36] <v0lZy> I have something like this
[01:55:03] <v0lZy> <div id="Page1"></div class="LeftShadow"></div></div>
[01:56:14] <v0lZy> LefShadow's height is 100%, and Page1's shadow is fixed. Now i made a link anchor which when i click, animates the size of #Page1 to 800px height. However, the .LeftShadow momentarily disappears so it looks like it flashes.
[01:56:16] <Haprog> v0lZy: you have one extra "/"
[01:56:34] <v0lZy> ah, yes, sorry, ignore that Haprog It was a typo (didnt copy paste)
[01:57:04] <Haprog> no idea then
[01:57:05] <v0lZy> I was expecing .LeftShadow to animate together with #Page1
[01:57:32] <v0lZy> but instead .LeftShadow disappers, #Page1 grows, then when the animation is complete, .LeftShadow reappers.
[01:59:15] <v0lZy> also maybe another question
[01:59:33] <v0lZy> does jquery understand css selectors?
[01:59:35] <v0lZy> like
[01:59:37] <v0lZy> can I do
[02:00:25] <v0lZy> $(#Page1 a).click ?
[02:00:39] <v0lZy> to just get links within #Page1 div?
[02:00:54] <Haprog> yes
[02:01:03] <Haprog> that's the whole point of jQuery :P
[02:01:20] <Haprog> but you need the selector to be a string ofcourse
[02:02:09] <Haprog> jQuery supports CSS3 selectors and adds some of it's own. see: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[02:04:17] <Haprog> so you can do selections like $('#mydiv > p.myclass a[href]') etc.
[02:04:31] <v0lZy> is there a way to travel up the tree, not just down?
[02:04:37] <v0lZy> for example
[02:04:39] <v0lZy> when clicking
[02:04:55] <Haprog> use .parent() or .parents()
[02:04:57] <Haprog> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/
[02:05:05] <v0lZy> $("#Page1 a").click  i need an operation done on #Page1
[02:05:28] <Haprog> you can use $(this).parent() in the click function
[02:06:07] <v0lZy> i need
[02:06:09] <v0lZy> parents parent
[02:06:13] <Haprog> inside click function call _this_ will be the dom node that you clicked on. and you need to wrap it in $() to get the jQuery object
[02:06:19] <v0lZy> $(this).parent().parent() ?
[02:06:20] <Miscuous> Hey is there a way to append a vertical scrollbar on a simple div without need of plugins ?
[02:06:34] <Haprog> you can also chain stuff like $('...').parent().parent() etc
[02:06:40] <v0lZy> ah, ok
[02:06:44] <v0lZy> Ill try that Haprog, hold on please
[02:06:52] <Haprog> most jQuery functions return a jQuery object
[02:06:59] <Haprog> for easy chaining
[02:08:04] <Haprog> sound like you should read some getting started with jQuery tutorial.
[02:08:07] <Haprog> *sounds
[02:08:22] <Haprog> jQuery has great documentation
[02:08:46] <Zogot> Ahoyhoy
[02:10:07] <v0lZy> ah, seems to work now
[02:10:22] <v0lZy> yeah, i learn as i go
[02:10:38] <v0lZy> i still dont know about the flashing issue
[02:10:56] <edgardo> v0lZy, show the code
[02:11:15] <v0lZy> $('#Page1 .ContentHolder .text_link').click(function(event) {
[02:11:17] <v0lZy> 			$(this).parent().parent().parent().animate({height:"800px"},0);
[02:11:19] <v0lZy> 		});
[02:11:30] <v0lZy> if i increase that 0 there to say 500
[02:11:34] <v0lZy> it disappers
[02:11:39] <v0lZy> maybe i can show in jsfiddle..
[02:12:05] <edgardo> yeah, with the appropriate css and html code for that snippet
[02:14:44] <v0lZy> hm
[02:14:48] <v0lZy> having difficulties here
[02:14:53] <v0lZy> i dont have this page live online
[02:14:57] <v0lZy> only on local wamp server
[02:15:02] <v0lZy> i can get the code to work
[02:15:08] <v0lZy> but it doesnt show what i mean
[02:15:13] <v0lZy> hold on, maybe i can modify
[02:19:38] <rickup> Hey imakewebthings?  You still here?
[02:21:20] <v0lZy> edgardo: Haprog: http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/
[02:21:31] <v0lZy> I made the shadows with a black background
[02:21:41] <v0lZy> its a mess to look at (lots of code, but just so u see the problem
[02:21:48] <v0lZy> when u click 'Read more'
[02:21:50] <v0lZy> you'll see it flash
[02:22:46] <v0lZy> cleaner jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/1/
[02:23:22] <v0lZy> see what i mean? the black shadows disappear until the animation is over
[02:23:59] <rickup> edgardo, when you are done helping v0lZy do you think you could take a look at the problem imakewebthings solved in jsfiddle but doesn't work yet on the actual site?
[02:26:11] <v0lZy> makes more sense this way: http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/2/
[02:26:16] <v0lZy> u can see that the div grows
[02:26:28] <v0lZy> but the divs it has inside just flash out until the animation is complete
[02:28:03] <v0lZy> I dont have a good knowledge of this things, but i suppose this is a sequential thing
[02:28:21] <v0lZy> first, size is altered (gradually), then all other elements inherit the size from its parent
[02:28:42] <v0lZy> maybe im missing some parameters to the animate function..
[02:30:05] <v0lZy> maybe step: now or osmething
[02:32:29] <rickup> anyone?
[02:32:49] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to get my panel to slide horizontally instead of squeeze close. Any ideas on how to do that? http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/30/
[02:36:48] <Morteza_ipo> hi
[02:37:09] <Morteza_ipo> how to change ui-effects-transfer css with jquery?
[02:38:23] <edgardo> v0lZy, what was your problem with this effect?
[02:38:54] <v0lZy> edgardo: try http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/2/
[02:38:58] <v0lZy> the shadows are black
[02:39:12] <v0lZy> if u click 'Read more' they disappear for the duration the div is grown in height
[02:39:18] <v0lZy> once the animation stops, the shadows come back
[02:39:26] <v0lZy> I dont like the way they disappear
[02:39:49] <v0lZy> id like them to grow together with the div, not disapper when they are to small and then magically appear the right size when the animation is done
[02:39:58] <Morteza_ipo> v0lZy: I want to make prestashop effect with jquery for my shop
[02:40:30] <v0lZy> I have no idea what prestashop is
[02:40:44] <Morteza_ipo> did you see transfer effect?
[02:41:10] <v0lZy> no.
[02:41:18] <Morteza_ipo> jqueryui!
[02:41:38] <Morteza_ipo> no?
[02:42:15] <v0lZy> I dont think im the right person to address Morteza
[02:42:22] <v0lZy> My jquery skills are limited
[02:42:31] <Morteza_ipo> I wannt this: when user clicked on add to basket , transfer effect do runing with that product image background.
[02:42:52] <Morteza_ipo> v0lZy: Sorry
[02:42:54] <v0lZy> maybe if u show me a demo.
[02:42:57] <Morteza_ipo> wait I send you a link
[02:43:03] <Morteza_ipo> ok
[02:43:17] <Morteza_ipo> v0lZy: wait for uploading
[02:46:50] <edgardo> v0lZy, why not just use border 20px instead of making divs around it?
[02:48:13] <v0lZy> because on the actual page, shadows are images
[02:48:23] <v0lZy> they arent solid .. they are transparent
[02:48:26] <v0lZy> but what i noticed just now
[02:48:37] <v0lZy> this seems to be because they are outside the div
[02:49:16] <v0lZy> ha
[02:49:18] <v0lZy> yes
[02:49:19] <v0lZy> that is the trick
[02:49:39] <Haprog> v0lZy: here's a bit cleaner version of your fiddle markup http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/3/
[02:49:41] <edgardo> v0lZy, also http://www.css3.info/preview/border-image/
[02:49:46] <v0lZy> its because they are outside the border (left -20px; top: -20px; bottom: -20px; right: -20px;
[02:50:07] <v0lZy> edgardo: but that is CSS3
[02:50:14] <v0lZy> what happens if the browser is css2 only?
[02:50:55] <v0lZy> (thanks for cleaning that up btw)
[02:51:00] <v0lZy> look at this
[02:51:23] <v0lZy> http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/4/
[02:51:37] <v0lZy> (i changed .LeftShadow left: -20px; to left: 0px;)
[02:51:43] <v0lZy> is this a bug?
[02:53:24] <v0lZy> Haprog, edgardo  is there some special relevance to when things are positioned outside the div but attached to it (in the way from the example)
[02:53:37] <Haprog> jQuery animate seems to add overflow:hidden for the duration of the animation
[02:53:50] <Haprog> to #Page1 in this case
[02:55:15] <v0lZy> yeah
[02:55:26] <edgardo> you learn something every day :)
[02:55:37] <v0lZy> :D
[02:55:44] <v0lZy> I dont understand why it does that though
[02:55:49] <v0lZy> or how to fix it
[02:55:57] <v0lZy> (if its a feature not an oversight).
[02:56:20] <v0lZy> i mean, the thing is, ok, i know a way around it
[02:56:24] <v0lZy> but i dont know what that means for my background
[02:56:40] <v0lZy> (can i margin it 10px from the border of the div on all sides?
[02:56:41] <Haprog> v0lZy: try to set "overflow: visible !important" on the div
[02:57:19] <Haprog> that seams to fix it
[02:57:23] <Haprog> *seems

[02:58:07] <v0lZy> ha, brilliant, that does fix it
[02:58:08] <Haprog> jQuery puts overflow hidden for animation to prevent scrollbars from appearing (when the element is made to collapse for example)
[02:58:20] <v0lZy> just one problem now
[02:58:27] <rickup> Will someone  please take a look at the problem imakewebthings solved in jsfiddle but doesn't work yet on the actual live site?  http://jsfiddle.net/imakewebthings/v2D6M/6/  works there is no price in the Plans elect Menu...
[02:58:30] <v0lZy> the text is.. hm...
[02:58:32] <v0lZy> hold on
[02:59:06] <v0lZy> ok
[02:59:10] <v0lZy> i think i kind of got it working
[02:59:23] <v0lZy> though theres another issue in how my titles are done then
[02:59:49] <v0lZy> but since there's only 1 title per page i think i can work around that
[03:00:24] <v0lZy> btw
[03:00:33] <v0lZy> any fix for internet explorer opacity fade in fade out stuff ye?
[03:00:36] <v0lZy> yet?
[03:00:51] <Haprog> btw in your case I'd "cache" the #Page1 jQuery object and use it like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3vsCb/7/
[03:02:28] <v0lZy> hm
[03:02:32] <v0lZy> I can see some benefit to that
[03:02:46] <v0lZy> but i dont think i understand completely
[03:03:05] <v0lZy> i mean, i understand that i store $('#Page1') as a variable
[03:06:13] <v0lZy> easier to maintain this
[03:06:19] <v0lZy> btw, internet explorer
[03:06:30] <v0lZy> fading objects with transparent backgrounds
[03:06:35] <v0lZy> has this been addressed yet?
[03:07:08] <s3d_matt> Hi All
[03:07:29] <s3d_matt> I need to run this code:   <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function(){ $("#subForm").live(validate()); }); </script> - however the form is within a fancy box - how do I make it bind or live?

[03:12:32] <Hackwar> hi folks, I'm scaling an image and I'm wondering if there is a good way to have th point around which it is scaling not in the upper left corner, but in the center of the image...
[03:12:36] <Hackwar> Any idea on that one?
[03:13:08] <Hackwar> the customer wants the image to always fill the whole screen, regardless of screen resolution or browser window size
[03:13:38] <someprimetime> with class="foo bar" how can I find "bar"?
[03:13:54] <Haprog> someprimetime: what do you mean?
[03:14:28] <v0lZy> Hackwar: maybe height: auto width auto...
[03:14:31] <Haprog> if you just want to select the element, just use $('.bar')
[03:14:33] <someprimetime> like if I'm looking through an event object and want to find a specific class within a list of X classes.. e.g. <a class="foo bar blah" >  how can I find blah?
[03:14:52] <someprimetime> i want to traverse through all classes in the event object and return a specific one
[03:15:31] <Haprog> someprimetime: how do you know which one to select? do you just want to check if class bar exists in the list of some element?
[03:16:23] <someprimetime> Haprog: yes, exactly
[03:17:02] <someprimetime> i could set an attribute specifically, but i'm toggling a class, so it makes more sense to look inside the 'class' attribute
[03:17:17] <Haprog> someprimetime: .hasClass()
[03:17:17] <someprimetime> and then just replace it in there.
[03:17:35] <someprimetime> Haprog: that rules thanks!
[03:17:35] <Haprog> there's also .toggleClass()
[03:17:47] <Haprog> so you don't have to check for yourself :P
[03:18:16] <s3d_matt> I need to run this code:  <script type="text/javascript"> $(document).ready(function(){ $("#subForm").live(validate()); }); </script> - however the form is within a fancy box - how do I make it bind or live?
[03:18:41] <someprimetime> hehe thanks ;)

[03:38:07] <someprimetime> how can i add a class to the previous 'a' element? i'm doing something like $(this).parents('a').prev().addClass('foo') to no avail
[03:38:49] <rickup> On the live site the price is still in the Select Menu...  http://easywaas.com/locations/century-city-virtual-office  The prices need to stay in the Yes/No Options I only need them hidden in the first Plans* Select Menu

[03:44:02] <v0lZy> big step forward for me
[03:44:06] <v0lZy> and my page
[03:44:23] <rickup> If you notice the prices only show up when the select is "selected"
[04:16:35] <edgardo> v0lZy, heh np.. not like I was much of a help :D
[04:20:23] <v0lZy> perhaps u can help me now then
[04:20:26] <v0lZy> something really simple
[04:20:50] <v0lZy> if height of #Page1 = 800, do blah, else do blah1
[04:21:00] <v0lZy> i know i can mix javascript and jquery
[04:21:03] <v0lZy> but i dont think i want to :D
[04:37:32] <v0lZy> erm
[04:37:35] <v0lZy> what am i doing wrong?
[04:37:37] <v0lZy> if (Page1.height() == '400') { Page1.animate({height:"230px"),500); }
[04:37:49] <v0lZy> ah

[04:38:45] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/j48y2/
[04:38:51] <edgardo> I made this little looping thingy
[04:41:37] <v0lZy> hm.. almost got it working
[04:41:51] <v0lZy> nice
[04:42:33] <v0lZy> hm
[04:42:37] <v0lZy> im having difficulties
[04:44:28] <v0lZy> ;(
[04:44:31] <v0lZy> I dont know what im doing wrong
[04:45:34] <v0lZy> edgardo: can u see anything wrong with this: http://jsfiddle.net/mtAzL/ ?
[04:46:21] <v0lZy> ah
[04:46:23] <v0lZy> ) {
[04:46:25] <v0lZy> erm .. ]
[04:46:27] <v0lZy> }
[04:46:29] <v0lZy> darnit
[04:46:54] <v0lZy> yeeey, it works
[04:47:47] <edgardo> fiddling around usually helps.. sorry wasn't looking here for a while
[04:53:05] <Engin> best image gallery ? modal popup, handles key presses ?
[04:56:51] <v0lZy> wahoo, it works
[04:56:53] <v0lZy> and its awesome :D
[04:58:56] <edgardo> v0lZy, don't want to spoil your party, but wouldn't it just be easier to use slideToggle instead of animate.. try this: http://jsfiddle.net/GnbDa/
[04:59:38] <v0lZy> dont know
[04:59:42] <v0lZy> have no idea how slidetoggle works
[05:00:19] <edgardo> http://jsfiddle.net/GnbDa/1/
[05:00:21] <v0lZy> but im happy with the way it is now
[05:00:25] <edgardo> also, there is a close link now
[05:00:40] <edgardo> with animate you have to specify the height
[05:00:45] <v0lZy> yeah
[05:00:55] <edgardo> what if your content is 300px in height, and you slide it down 800pc
[05:00:57] <edgardo> px*
[05:01:01] <edgardo> it will look stupid :)
[05:01:11] <v0lZy> what do u mean?
[05:01:20] <edgardo> slidetoggle slides the content, and takes just as much space as it needs
[05:01:29] <v0lZy> but i need extra space
[05:01:36] <edgardo> for what?
[05:01:47] <v0lZy> alignment
[05:02:02] <edgardo> that doesn't make any sense to me :x sry
[05:02:22] <v0lZy> i could align with <br /> i suppose
[05:02:23] <edgardo> what is it you want to align?
[05:02:29] <v0lZy> i need some space between the bottom and the edge.
[05:02:39] <v0lZy> bottom of the text
[05:02:44] <edgardo> add padding to the bottom
[05:02:51] <v0lZy> well thats the thing
[05:02:58] <v0lZy> i have a div inside a div in which i have text
[05:03:06] <v0lZy> the nested div has height 100%
[05:03:19] <v0lZy> of the parent div and is absolutely aligned
[05:03:33] <v0lZy> if i add padding to it, its gonna complicate that
[05:04:00] <edgardo> position: absolute doesn't care about padding
[05:06:47] <v0lZy> no
[05:07:00] <v0lZy> but size 100% is the problem
[05:08:48] <edgardo> v0lZy, http://www.quirksmode.org/css/box.html
[05:09:33] <edgardo> http://css-tricks.com/examples/BoxSizing/
[05:09:36] <edgardo> it's css2
[05:10:33] <edgardo> if you want to use width 100% and padding, you just set: -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box;
[05:10:44] <v0lZy> yeah im with w3c model
[05:11:00] <edgardo> then the padding won't effect the rendered width of a div
[05:11:20] <v0lZy> i hate how things arent standardized
[05:11:24] <v0lZy> and not everything is css3 etc
[05:11:28] <edgardo> who are you coding your page to? your grandma sitting on windows 2000 and IE6? :D
[05:11:31] <v0lZy> and explorer having separate shit than mozilla.
[05:11:35] <v0lZy> no
[05:11:41] <v0lZy> just.. everyone i can
[05:11:54] <v0lZy> hopefully not many people with javascript disabled out there.
[05:12:06] <ravenzz> edgardo it is css3
[05:12:31] <ravenzz> it is not supported by ie<8 though
[05:13:25] <edgardo> I've read several places that it's css2 or css2.1
[05:13:33] <ravenzz> caniuse.com
[05:13:43] <ravenzz> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#box-sizing
[05:15:03] <edgardo> oh snap.. the interweb has lied to me!
[05:15:58] <edgardo> but nevertheless, I'd use it and make it look 'less pretty' for <5% of the people looking at the page
[05:16:15] <edgardo> saves a lot of time and headaches :)
[05:16:16] <ravenzz> np, anyway it's well supported by most of modern browsers, you could polyfill it if you need to support ie7, if you need ie6 too you are chinese i guess :;_p
[05:16:51] <edgardo> or on a library computer in uganda
[05:17:56] <ravenzz> they probably use ff on uGundu
[05:19:28] <edgardo> css should really implement some kind of browser detection, so that you can have different styles specific elements with different browsers
[05:20:18] <edgardo> they have that media-detection or what it's called, so that you can have different styles according to the screen resolution
[05:22:21] <ravenzz> if you follow the specs and some best practice you don't really need to know which browser is rendering the page
[05:23:30] <edgardo> I think it does when you implement css3
[05:25:47] <edgardo> damn this rain.. I have a 1km walk to the grossery store and I'm not going to go get myself wet :)
[05:39:29] <ravenzz> ahah I got wet more than one time this summer in norway trying to reach the grocery store
[05:45:01] <sunscreen> javascript disabled on a modern desktop prity much would make you some sort of sadomasochist

[06:33:53] <PaperBoy> Hi, how can i expland a div from its current size. I dont want it completely hidden at the start ..  I want the current height to remain and when a link is clicked  for it to grow and display full content
[06:35:52] <dabear> ?slidedown @ PaperBoy
[06:35:53] <Guest29085> PaperBoy, .slideDown([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements with a sliding motion. http://api.jquery.com/slideDown/
[06:40:09] <PaperBoy> dabear,  all the exmaples i see only work with already hidden elimites
[06:40:13] <PaperBoy> elements
[06:40:23] <dabear> ?tias @ PaperBoy
[06:40:23] <Guest29085> PaperBoy, Try It And See
[06:42:56] <PaperBoy> i have seen any examples use it, all do the drop down form a hidden div
[06:43:15] <PaperBoy> im a noob so i cant just try it... im looking at all avaiable examples that show how ot use it
[06:43:36] <dabear> use the example, make your div non hidden
[06:43:47] <dabear> it should just work(tm)
[06:44:26] <dabear> or just use animate("height", "400px")
[06:44:35] <dabear> ?animate @ PaperBoy
[06:44:36] <Guest29085> PaperBoy, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [complete]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[06:45:16] <dabear> hm, think I got that wrong
[06:45:40] <dabear> .animate({ height: "300px"}, "slow")
[06:59:33] <sunscreen> if the person who made jquery.customselect.js is in here ... you rock man !!!

[08:04:15] <nickynyfiken> Hi, I am trying to use .load but I am having problem understanding how I can use the data attribute. If I for example send in a string how can I retrive it in the page that I wrote as the first paramter to .load?
[08:08:17] <dabear> nickynyfiken: serverside?
[08:08:51] <dabear> depends on what language you use on your server, it's $_GET / $_POST in php
[08:19:58] <Zogot> For anyone who saw my question, I fixed it, for anyone interested: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/HyjrJ/
[08:20:48] <htrejh> hi
[08:20:57] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to detect when a field is invalid or is required based on the html5 structure ?
[08:21:32] <htrejh> i have a web page containing a lot of images, which makes scrolling not smooth, is there a way to smooth this using js/jquery? like on the website wallbase.cc
[08:22:30] <dabear> zogot: strange, I see you here, but not in the nick list of this channel :s
[08:26:40] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to detect when a field is invalid or is required based on the html5 structure ?
[08:26:43] <_cb> i have a page that uses $("#idv").load(url) to load the page at url. Text loads but images do not. If i put the url on a browsesr then text and iimages load. Any fixes other than making url absolute?
[08:33:01] <dabear> _cb: the url probably includes sub dirs
[08:33:24] <dabear> like load("foo/bar/baz.html")
[08:34:16] <dabear> if the baz page references an image, it would search in the foo/bar directory for that image, but because you load it through the front page, it would look directrly under the web page root for the images
[08:35:56] <dabear> _cb: so having absolute urls would be the best solution; <img src="/mobile/logo.png" alt=""/>
[08:36:22] <_cb> dabear everything is on the same folder but folder in the url is a different folder than the page using .load
[08:36:47] <dabear> _cb: that's what I was trying to say
[08:37:14] <dabear> .load just inserts the html into the current page
[08:37:30] <_cb> Bummer. Was hoping I could do something besides absolute.
[08:37:37] <dabear> so any references to resources would search the root path
[08:38:56] <_cb> ok maybe I will just build a function that builds the path on the fly. Thanks!
[08:40:55] <dabear> a simple $.get(url, function(data){ $(data.replace(/foo/, "bar")).appendTo("#something")}) would possibly be simpler to implement
[08:41:31] <dabear> where you put a regex that matches src paths and replaces them
[08:45:48] <Gergov> guys how can i make a div, when i click on this div something to happen but only once? if i click second time.. or third i want nothing to happen
[08:47:29] <Zogot> can remove the class that triggers the event
[08:47:33] <Zogot> when you click it
[08:47:45] <Gergov> ah thanks :)
[08:55:47] <alex88> hi guys, i'm replacing a paginator after a ajax request, i've seen the live function but it says in 1.7 is deprecated, but if i use on it's not working on new elements
[08:57:19] <alex88> oh nm, had to attach to document :)
[09:01:52] <held> #hibernate
[09:10:40] <Gergov> i have div #boxes and inside i have 3 divs with class box1, now will this remove the class box1 in the first div  $('#boxes div:first').removeClass('box1');
[09:11:50] <AaronCampbell_> How is the best way to get the width and height of the current viewport in the browser?
[09:16:56] <alex88> AaronCampbell: javascript?
[09:17:12] <alex88> oh, was thinking this was in another chan :)
[09:17:51] <AaronCampbell> nevermind, I realized that .width() and .height() work on jQuery(window)
[09:28:54] <ohcibi> i have an elem.attr('required') call in my script where IE9 just returns undefined, why is that?
[09:29:11] <ohcibi> in ie8 or ie7 mode it returns something != undefined
[09:30:33] <ohcibi> (elem has required="required" of course)
[09:36:31] <Zogot> any idea why this isn't working on my localhost...http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/4yG6P/
[09:36:54] <Zogot> the normal way, declaring it in $(document).ready(function(){ //here// } works though
[09:39:42] <ohcibi> Zogot: your executing the function instead giving a pointer to it
[09:39:53] <ohcibi> Zogot: remove the ()
[09:40:32] <Zogot> thanks man :)

[10:17:44] <ravenzz> you are not requiring jquery
[10:18:48] <ravenzz> plainas ^
[10:18:59] <ravenzz> also you should use setInterval this way setInterval( function() { slide()}, 3000 );

[10:41:31] <bonhoffer> i'm trying to figure out how to pass options to: http://multidatespickr.sourceforge.net/
[10:42:05] <bonhoffer> i want to do something like var options; options.getDates = date_array if (date_array > 0)
[10:42:16] <bonhoffer> but i'm not sure if that works that way
[10:45:42] <snover> ?101 @ bonhoffer
[10:45:42] <bot-t> bonhoffer, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:46:09] <bonhoffer> snover, ha -- yeah -- i've worked with js for awhile, but never had this use case before
[10:46:25] <guest_> help
[10:46:47] <guest_> in an autocomplete menu, how do you trigger an event to focus on the first item
[10:46:51] <bonhoffer> is there a part of that guide that speaks to sending options to function instead of putting them in as arguments?
[10:46:57] <guest_> or the 3rd item
[10:47:45] <snover> bonhoffer: I don’t know what you mean. If you want to send an arbitrary map of arguments, use an object as the first argument…
[10:49:22] <bonhoffer> snover, sorry i'm not clear -- i think i see it -- right now i'm doing $('foo').bar({a: 1, b: [1,2,3]}), i want to be able to pass in,say, $('foo').bar({a: 1})
[10:50:00] <bonhoffer> so i need to do options = {a: 1} if dates_array.length == 0 otherwise options = {a: 1, b: dates_array}
[10:50:08] <bonhoffer> then just pass options .. .. makes sense
[10:50:13] <takahiro3> hi can someone help me figure out why my tooltip is at the wrong position? http://thorie.com/exercise/3col.php
[10:50:18] <bonhoffer> that is a hash data-type right?\
[10:56:13] <bl4ckcomb> which license should I mention with the uglify.js file if I tend to reuse it? (situated in the jquery github build subfolder)
[10:58:24] <berndj> how can i add jquery to a page i don't control - from within the chome js console / firebug - just so i can do stuff in the console?  i tried document.write('<script ...') but it emptied the page!
[10:58:30] <iman> when I use this stuff  $.cookie('isUserActive'); , all js function stop and my page mixed, is it wrong ?
[11:02:09] <aaairc> how do i have jquery go to a new url when a .click() occurs?
[11:02:55] <berndj> aaairc, just change the location.  window.location or something
[11:03:09] <sunscreen> no jq needed
[11:03:50] <sunscreen> any one got a good customizable selectbox plugin?
[11:04:02] <sunscreen> 1 that can have multiple instances
[11:04:06] <snover> selectbox plugin?
[11:04:40] <aaairc> berndj: so something like this? document.location.href='/newpage/';
[11:05:10] <berndj> aaairc, yes. the browser will respond to the change in document.location by loading the new page
[11:05:22] <aaairc> berndj: thank you
[11:09:40] <sunscreen> yeh http://www.acewebdesign.com.au/customselect.php
[11:10:40] <sveisvei> Whats the name of the uber IE performance analyzer (memory etc) extention?
[11:10:46] <sveisvei> cant remember :S
[11:11:19] <snover> dynatrace.
[11:11:35] <sveisvei> snover: Thanx!
[11:16:07] <Zogot> http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/xutte/ Is this the correct way.  I'm not expecting it to be, but I didn't work if I moved the stuff currently in the bindX(){} into the ready function
[11:17:52] <Whirl3d> so .on is not distributable? In other words: $(".class").on() won't apply the .on handler to each .class item?
[11:18:11] <Zogot> More that it wont apply it to an element just added to the dom
[11:18:26] <Zogot> Its why I had to put it in the bind function, and call the bind at the end of the widget function
[11:19:34] <Vinny> does jquery have an .on method?
[11:19:52] <Whirl3d> new in 1.7
[11:20:15] <Vinny> do they doc on it?
[11:20:35] <Whirl3d> ?.on
[11:20:36] <bot-t> Whirl3d, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:21:12] <Vinny> thanks, i could see it on the api page for some reason
[11:21:55] <Zogot> What you think Whirl3d, any ideas :)?
[11:22:19] <Whirl3d> lemme check
[11:24:23] <Whirl3d> this may not help, but try adding datatype:"html" to your ajax call. I am not sure whether it's dataType or not, and it may not help. I just had a lot of problems recently because I left that out.
[11:25:57] <affect> hey guys, I've got an element on the page. there's an external js file that gets loaded in the header and does ".unbind('click').click(function" on the element. is it possible to prepend this handler with a custom function? all tutorials I've seen copied the click handler using elem.onclick, but apparently this doesn't work for jquery-defined click handlers?
[11:26:04] <Zogot> nope :(.  The removeProduct isn't getting any listener to it,  Looking at it in the chrometools
[11:27:11] <Whirl3d> I think the goal of the .onHandler is to delegate events.
[11:28:00] <Whirl3d> So you might want to have one handler and don't worry about binding to each item. If you are going to bind to each item, just use bind or the shortcut click
[11:29:12] <Whirl3d> but you could bind .on ("click":function (e) { if (e.target.is('.addProduct') addProduct();});
[11:29:43] <Whirl3d> *bind that to the element containing the add/remove elements
[11:30:04] <Zogot> aye, i just tried with .live, and it works fine.  I though .on was supposed to replace .live
[11:30:52] <Whirl3d> right. but you would use .on on the parent of both buttons to handle it. .live is a lot more work for the browser every time
[11:31:17] <Whirl3d> You could run one .on command when a click event bubbles up, catch it, look at it , do what you need.
[11:31:33] <Zogot> ah, fair enough.  Thanks man :)
[11:31:53] <Whirl3d> Or you could have the dom check every time something is added for a list of classes so that it can then bind the click events, and then when clicked, have them fire the same handler...A lot more code
[11:32:46] <Whirl3d> with .on, adding child elements to something with .on bound will automatically bubble up the click event to the .on handler---making it a lot easier than .live
[11:33:36] <Whirl3d> And then if you want to implement custom handlers for the child elements, just stop propogation of the event and the on handler won't fire
[11:33:56] <Whirl3d> *for a single element, for example..
[11:34:42] <_ramo> hi and good evening
[11:35:06] <_ramo> is it possible to build up a datascroller with jquery (as in facecbook, xing, etc.?)
[11:36:36] <guest_> in an autocomplete menu, how do you trigger an event to focus on the first item
[11:36:37] <guest_> or the 3rd item
[11:41:28] <Whirl3d> _ramo, yes
[11:41:50] <Whirl3d> guest_ did you look in the api for autocomplete?

[11:43:16] <Iarfen> Hi
[11:43:25] <Iarfen> I need to position an element just bellow another, how I can do it??
[11:44:34] <_ramo> Whirl3d: can you point me somewhere where i can see a description of it?
[11:47:14] <Whirl3d> Zogot, something like this: It's rough, but it get's the idea across: http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/xutte/9/
[11:47:44] <Whirl3d> larfen, that depends on a lot of things. You should lookup .position and .offset
[11:47:59] <Whirl3d> ?.offset@larfen
[11:48:00] <bot-t> larfen, .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/

[11:49:53] <_ramo> :)
[11:50:21] <Whirl3d> I forgot about that. Sry. go to jquery UI and look up scroller widget
[11:51:00] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[11:51:12] <_ramo> there i s no scroller widget
[11:52:22] <Whirl3d> _ramo, what do you mean "like facebook, xing, etc? I thought you meant a slider...
[11:54:12] <_ramo> Whirl3d: no i mean if i scroll down and the "old posts" that were made are loaded dynamically
[11:54:42] <_ramo> or at thing, if i enter a specific area with my mouse it updates this area
[11:58:25] <Whirl3d> You are gonna have to show us an example.
[12:00:19] <emx> jquery mobile can load pages by ajax. what do i do with all the ids that might be present in both the initial page and the loaded one? does jquer mobile have a tweak or is this html5 comfort anyways?
[12:01:08] <Whirl3d> have you tried #jquerymobile ? I don't know anything about jquery mobile
[12:01:38] <emx> Whirl3d, ah, i tried #jquer-mobile
[12:01:39] <emx> thanks
[12:01:42] <WellWisher> can anyone point me to an example for Jquery based Image Slider On mouse hover at right and left extremes
[12:01:48] <Whirl3d> If you load the content via ajax, before you add it to the dom, you can text-process the loaded content and swap out the ids with unique ones.
[12:01:50] <_ramo> Whirl3d: that's what facebook is doing, when you scroll down.
[12:02:15] <Whirl3d> I don't use facebook, so that doesn't mean anything to me. Sorry
[12:02:34] <emx> Whirl3d, css-technically it's impossible since some styles of jquery mobile depend on it.
[12:03:05] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, here: http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2011/09/jquery-slider.html
[12:03:10] <_ramo> incrementally load the older content if you scroll down.... or google when you search pictures.... scrolle down and it's all loaded dynamically
[12:03:47] <_ramo> Whirl3d: go to google and search for a picture
[12:03:53] <Whirl3d> _ramo, I have never seen a jquery plugin for that.
[12:03:57] <_ramo> wait until you get the results, and than start scrolling down
[12:03:58] <_ramo> okay
[12:04:24] <Whirl3d> You are probably going to have to build it yourself. But it shouldn't be hard
[12:04:49] <WellWisher> thanks whirld
[12:05:10] <Whirl3d> just capture the scroll event and know the window size and keep one window-size worth of content loaded and off screen. Then on scroll, load the next row.
[12:05:26] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, np
[12:18:02] <Whirl3d> how do you turn keycodes into characters?
[12:21:11] <dotjs> Hi. I'm coding a jQuery plugin, and there's a bug that I can't fix. Can someone help me? :)
[12:22:12] <bot-t> dotjs, Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[12:22:30] <p5yx> test
[12:22:42] <dotjs> Wait, I'm preparing a jsfiddle
[12:24:05] <p5yx> hi guys, is it possible to parse certain things like ids from an xmlhttprequest responsetext with jquery?? if so how?? i'm searching for it so long...
[12:24:54] <Whirl3d> I like bot-t's new just ask message...
[12:25:09] <snover> It is not new.
[12:25:28] <snover> but I am sure bot-t is glad you like it
[12:25:32] <Whirl3d> never seen it before, but I love it
[12:25:55] <dotjs> http://jsfiddle.net/EqTuG/1/ can someone help me with that? I descriped the problem with comments in the HTML section
[12:28:00] <Whirl3d> dotjs, I think you should checkout the .on handler (new in 1.7, I think) to handle your toggle events
[12:28:46] <dotjs> Hm, alright. But not using them shouldnt cause this bug should it?
[12:29:58] <Whirl3d> you need to use return (this.each(funciton () {.....}) in your closure to make it chainable.
[12:30:55] <dotjs> Whirl3d, you are right
[12:31:02] <dotjs> I forgot to use .each :) Thank you so much!
[12:32:37] <Whirl3d> np
[12:33:13] <Whirl3d> still, check into .on   It's great for form handling
[12:34:33] <dotjs> I will!
[12:36:18] <Whirl3d> if I bind to the keydown event and I get e.which for the keycode, how can I filter it with regex? I need to convert it to a character then I can test it..but how

[12:37:06] * Whirl3d shakes uncontrollably
[12:37:36] <WellWisher> while i'm trying to add the jquery javascript code to header file of vbulletin, it is not saving the new edits
[12:37:51] <WellWisher> do i need to replace $ with Jquery?
[12:38:29] <Whirl3d> what is a vbulletin?
[12:39:01] <WellWisher> cms forum software to run forums
[12:39:13] <WellWisher> php based
[12:39:31] <sunscreen> this drop down select input with  icons is a right old crock  :(
[12:39:38] <sunscreen> sfsdf
[12:39:39] <Whirl3d> sunscreen, soo close. I need to prohibit characters from being entered in an input field by catching them in advance. So I need character by character validation
[12:40:30] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, there's a jquery no conflict setting that might help. Not familiar with vbulletin
[12:41:15] <WellWisher> yeah, tried adding it also
[12:41:17] <sunscreen> when is the jquery plugins web site going to work again
[12:41:20] <WellWisher> but not allowing it
[12:41:55] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, I'm afraid this is a vbulletin thing more than a jquery thing. I wish I could be more help.
[12:42:17] <WellWisher> ok
[12:42:29] <dotjs> How can I execute a function when a checkbox gets checked or unchecked? The .change() event handler doesn't seem to trigger when I add / remove the checked attribute with JavaScript. It only triggers when I click the checkbox
[12:43:15] <Whirl3d> dotjs, perhaps you should use .trigger("click") on the checkboxes.
[12:44:13] <ajpiano> Whirl3d: see ?mdc String.fromCharCode
[12:44:14] <sunscreen> Whirl3d,  something like $("input [name=filterinput]").keyup( function { console.log($(this).val();} /*perform regexing here */ } );
[12:44:14] <bot-t> Whirl3d, fromCharCode - MDN - Returns a string created by using the specified sequence of Unicode values. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[12:44:42] <Whirl3d> ajpiano, I just found that. Thanks.
[12:45:18] <dotjs> Whirl3d I'm looking for a way to find out when the attribute is changed via JavaScript not via clicking
[12:45:20] <Whirl3d> sunscreen, this.val() shows that the character has already been added to the input val. I want to prohibit that. Plus .val() gives the entire string of the input value, not just the caracter
[12:45:26] <WellWisher> when i add eliminate those lines, it is accepting edits http://pastebin.com/fztCVcje
[12:45:40] <WellWisher> sorry, when i eliminate the above said lines
[12:46:09] <WellWisher> those 2 lines are the problem but they are the main
[12:46:28] <Whirl3d> WellWisher, try using $(document).ready(function () {$......
[12:46:45] <sunscreen> http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[12:46:57] <WellWisher> ok
[12:46:58] <sunscreen> that example is actually kinda cool
[12:47:40] <Whirl3d> keypress handles the event after the key is pressed and added. I am using keydown (so that it's not added yet) and String.fromCharCode() to get the character that I can test with regex. I'll post back in a minute
[12:48:37] <bonhoffer> hey -- i've got a quick syntax question: https://gist.github.com/1431235
[12:50:34] * sunscreen smashes <Select> with a size 50 crowbar
[12:51:05] * Rembane hands sunscreen dynamite
[12:53:05] <bonhoffer> i'm trying my solution, but it is not working in console, maybe i need to refresh
[12:56:26] <WellWisher> this thing isnt allowed ({ })
[12:56:41] <WellWisher> .ready(function(jquery) {
[12:56:54] <WellWisher> when i removed that syntax, it works fine
[12:57:06] <dotjs> What's actually the difference between .prop() and .attr() ?
[12:57:17] <Whirl3d> $("document").ready(function () { do your init functions here});
[12:57:26] <WellWisher> yeah
[12:57:51] <WellWisher> but adding .ready(function () { isnt allowing to save the edits
[12:58:17] <Whirl3d> which edits are you talking about?
[12:58:26] <WellWisher> as it has consecutive braces and the system is thinking it is wrong syntax
[12:58:39] <WellWisher> adding the jquery js code
[12:58:39] <Whirl3d> sounds like a problem with vbulletin
[12:58:59] <WellWisher> no other syntax to make it work?
[12:59:07] <WellWisher> in the jquery
[13:00:15] <Whirl3d> here's the deal: because jquery loads before all fo the dom elements are loaded, you end up with problems trying to use jquery before the document is ready. The things you want to access aren't there yet.
[13:00:31] <Whirl3d> So you have to figure out how to do your jquery work after the dom is loaded.
[13:00:47] <Whirl3d> Perhaps you could put it in a script tag and the end of the body of the document...i don't know.
[13:01:36] <WellWisher> ok
[13:03:24] <Whirl3d> I take it that your cms is checking the content before you save it to ensure that it is valid. You should look up vbulletin to see if there's a workaround, because ({}) is really common notation in javascript/jquery, etc.
[13:05:51] <Whirl3d> Another way to do it which sound equally problematic is to use the (function($) { your code})(jQuery);  that also ensures that your code is run only when the dom is ready. I'd double check the syntax, though. I might've missed a { or ( or something.
[13:06:16] <Eviltwin> (function($) { your code})(jQuery); doesn't ensure your code is running on DOM ready
[13:06:19] <Eviltwin> Why would you think that?
[13:06:38] <Whirl3d> nvm. Eviltwin knows much better than I do.
[13:06:50] <Eviltwin> jQuery(function($){ your code }); does
[13:07:08] <Eviltwin> Which is an alias for jQuery(document).ready(function($){ your code });
[13:07:20] <Whirl3d> That's why I suggested that you look it up. I felt like I had the nomenclature wrong.
[13:08:33] <Whirl3d> If you bind the keydown event, the character is not added to the input field yet, right? So can I prevent the character from being added to the input field?
[13:09:00] <Whirl3d> So I could restrict input to just numbers, for example.
[13:10:34] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/fyVAE/
[13:11:17] <Whirl3d> doesn't answer the question.
[13:11:31] <Eviltwin> Looks like preventing keydown or keypress will stop the char from appearing there
[13:11:36] <Eviltwin> But not keyup
[13:12:41] <Whirl3d> Yeah. stopping the event on keydown prohibits keyup from firing.
[13:13:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: This is a useful site: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/keys.html
[13:15:28] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, you are a veritable coruncopia of knowledge. thanks again.

[13:45:33] <vsmith> yeah it seem the website there is down but i have a local copy of the plugin at the site
[13:46:19] <Eviltwin> Looks like there's a bug in this Fancy Zoom jquery Script
[13:46:57] <vsmith> i grabbed it a while back
[13:46:59] <Eviltwin> Do you have an unminified version of it?
[13:47:28] <vsmith> let me see
[13:47:50] <vsmith> i actually think i am not using that version so i can eliminate it.
[13:49:31] <vsmith> Awesome !  removing that did the trick. Thanks
[13:51:03] <vsmith> Eviltwin: everything is working once i removed the junk script
[13:51:19] <Eviltwin> Good!

[14:10:08] <bobdobbs> Hey guys. Some programming languages have tools for finding dead code, right? Code that will never be reached. Are there such tools for js ?
[14:11:40] <snover> closure compiler and uglifyjs both optimize away dead code
[14:12:10] <bobdobbs> thanks
[14:14:16] <Eviltwin> Just do you guys know jQuery doesn't advertise support for Google Closure
[14:14:33] <snover> um, what?
[14:15:22] <Eviltwin> sindresorhus: http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/limitations.html
[14:15:24] <Eviltwin> Err
[14:15:25] <Eviltwin> snover: http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/limitations.html
[14:15:38] <snover> closure compiler in non-advanced mode works just fine eviltwin.
[14:15:50] <Eviltwin> Right
[14:15:54] <Eviltwin> I'd imagine so
[14:30:35] <gurde> why do i get this error in Safari: TypeError: 'undefined' is not a function (evaluating 'this.hide.bind(this)') ?
[14:30:52] <gurde> can't bind the scope?
[14:31:10] <gurde> silly, in FF Chrome and IE works fine
[14:32:12] <gurde> any ideas?
[14:32:24] <luite> this.hide? shoudn't that be this.hide()  ?
[14:32:41] <luite> oh wait
[14:32:42] <luite> .bind
[14:32:43] <luite> sorry
[14:33:22] <gurde> this.close.on('click', this.hide.bind(this));
[14:33:51] <gurde> hide is my own method in my own object
[14:33:53] <Eviltwin> Because bind for a function doesn't exist in most browsers
[14:34:03] <Eviltwin> You can use $.proxy(this.hide,this) instead
[14:34:13] <gurde> how can i make it work for safari?
[14:34:25] <luite> hmm good to know
[14:34:31] <coldhead> hi kids
[14:34:49] <gurde> Eviltwin: trying now
[14:36:24] <captcadaver> hi
[14:37:11] <gurde> Eviltwin: that worked, but I have one more question
[14:37:40] <gurde> how can i make it work for this: $(this.inputsValidatorSelector).each(function(index, input) { /*        */ }.bind(this));
[14:38:39] <Eviltwin> $(this.inputsValidatorSelector).each($.proxy(function(index, input) { /* */ }, this))
[14:39:08] <captcadaver> i'm struggling to learn a more effective way to debug javascript
[14:39:17] <Eviltwin> Firebug
[14:39:18] <captcadaver> i've just been using alert() and then console.log() in firebug
[14:39:23] <gurde> Eviltwin: i didn't think about that
[14:39:32] <edgardo> http://www.pastie.org/private/cjjjsicwffoj2fpynmursg  << ---- VS ---- >>  http://www.pastie.org/private/ma3ez3z2wnfzq11bqcmz2a
[14:39:36] <captcadaver> there's a script tab but i can't ever get it to turn on. i get this message: Script Panel was inactive during page load
[14:39:37] <edgardo> which is better and why?
[14:39:48] <captcadaver> i have script "enabled"
[14:39:54] <radiantstatic> I'm attempting to put this panel on top of my current page. What steps do I need to take so that this won't interfere with my current layout. http://jsfiddle.net/radiantstatic/tD7dQ/41/
[14:39:54] <captcadaver> in the firebug interface
[14:41:58] <gurde> Eviltwin: thanks for the suggestions, i works great now :)
[14:45:21] <gurde> *it
[14:45:30] <captcadaver> simple question
[14:45:49] <Spadeski> captcadaver:  Ask
[14:45:56] <captcadaver> crap, one sec, just had a thought
[14:46:26] <captcadaver> ok
[14:46:36] <captcadaver> so, this might be from a weak understanding of the fundamentals of js
[14:46:41] <captcadaver> so i have a global variable called context. in a function, i try to call another function on it. i get "security error".
[14:47:03] <captcadaver> "on it", where "it" is the global var context
[14:47:26] <captcadaver> i'm wondering how i get rid of this error
[14:50:03] <Bankzilla> Create the variable outside the function, then set it inside?
[14:51:42] <Bankzilla> Global variables you can call using the windows object
[14:51:52] <Bankzilla> window.myVariableName
[14:53:10] <captcadaver> so when the document is ready, i initialized the var
[14:53:17] <captcadaver> after init, this is when i call the function
[14:53:24] <Bankzilla> 0
[14:53:56] <Bankzilla> Create a jsfiddle?
[14:53:57] <captcadaver> yeah, the var is declared outside of fxns
[14:54:51] <Bankzilla> I'm walking out for lunch, if it isn't answered when i get back i'll look into it
[14:54:52] <captcadaver> k, havent used jsfiddle so i'm not sure if it'll screw up but one sec
[14:55:53] <bonhoffer> is there an easy way to get all mondays between two dates?
[15:00:03] <NackNick> what does it mean when i get this error Uncaught ReferenceError: callURLParser is not defined?
[15:00:26] <ravenz> the function in question is not defined
[15:02:09] <NackNick> it works fine on my dev site
[15:02:16] <NackNick> but on my live site im getting that error
[15:02:59] <marshy> what's everyone doing  for cross domain ajax
[15:03:15] <ravenz> NackNick demo?
[15:03:50] <NackNick> what?
[15:04:07] <ravenz> can you provide a link I can take a look^?
[15:04:15] <marshy> does anyone use and recommend EasyXDM?
[15:04:16] <NackNick> dev.picsurf.com
[15:04:26] <NackNick> and picsurf.com
[15:04:57] <marshy> other than SlexAxton:
[15:06:10] <ravenz> marshy are you trying to do cross domain request between 2 websites of you?
[15:06:28] <marshy> ravenz: yes and no
[15:06:44] <marshy> ravenz: it's going to javascript running on someone else's site communicating with my own server
[15:06:45] <ravenz> NackNick how can I reproduce the issue?
[15:06:59] <NackNick> ohh 1 sec
[15:07:03] <marshy> going to be*
[15:07:06] <NackNick> http://dev.picsurf.com/photo_upload
[15:07:10] <NackNick> http://picsurf.com/photo_upload
[15:07:30] <NackNick> its line 67 on the live site
[15:07:50] <marshy> NackNick: where's the naked chicks
[15:07:57] <ravenz> marshy so basically you want the 'someone else's site' to make cross domain request to your website?
[15:08:03] <marshy> ravenz: correct
[15:08:27] <NackNick> lol
[15:08:37] <NackNick> its no t that kina site
[15:08:43] <marshy> NackNick: clearly ;)
[15:08:49] <marshy> ravenz: is EasyXDM my best bet?
[15:09:00] <marshy> wish easyXDM hada  jquery wrapper though...
[15:09:04] <ravenz> marshy https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTTP_access_control#Access-Control-Allow-Origin
[15:10:29] <marshy> ravenz: so my server needs to return Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[15:10:38] <marshy> when receiving ajax request?
[15:10:40] <ravenz> that goes on your app: eg <?php header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); ?>
[15:10:46] <ravenz> yep
[15:11:06] <marshy> so let's say i embed a javascript on my server
[15:11:09] <marshy> i mean
[15:11:13] <marshy> on my remote "other" site
[15:11:33] <marshy> that javascript opens a lightbox with a form, and the form is set to submit via ajax
[15:11:35] <marshy> jquery post
[15:11:54] <marshy> i'm not going to get an error if the form action points to a script on my server that returns a Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[15:13:05] <ravenz> correct
[15:13:10] <marshy> o.O
[15:13:57] <marshy> wow thanks ravenz, will try that out
[15:14:18] <ravenz> because you are aware of this, and you are explicitely allowing that
[15:14:18] <NackNick> so...
[15:14:28] <ravenz> NackNick back to your issue
[15:14:30] <PaperBoy> can anyone tell me how to make te  "read more" link effect where a div is currently showing content but not in full and once a link is clicked it would grow to show the rest of the content?
[15:15:13] <ravenz> NackNick is your function defined somewhere in your page?
[15:15:40] <ravenz> PaperBoy have you googled it?
[15:16:24] <bobdobbs> PaperBoy: you might want to look at the docs for click() and resize()
[15:16:30] <bobdobbs> http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[15:16:43] <bobdobbs> http://api.jquery.com/click/
[15:18:36] <NackNick> no not that i know of
[15:18:44] <NackNick> i dont see it anywhere
[15:18:53] <NackNick> on either sites
[15:19:49] <marshy> ravenz: looks like it's only IE8+
[15:24:07] <marshy> ravenz: i may have to use easyXDM after all?
[15:32:55] <ravenz> sorry marshy I have to go, someone else could give you further help
[15:32:56] <ravenz> bye
[15:33:28] <christo_m> Hello , is anyone familiar enough with gameQuery to explain to me how i can have collision detection amongst a bunch of sprites contained in a group
[15:33:44] <christo_m> the tut on their site shows how to test between a sprite and a group, but i want all the sprites in the group checked against each other
[15:38:08] <newbye> hello
[15:38:49] <DRSK> I have a set of <option> elements, I with to store some data per option and I'm thinking of using a data-{tag} for it, but I'm not sure what tag to use. Is it completely optional or are there some pre set ones like "data-type"?
[15:39:37] <newbye> can anyone please help me a little?
[15:39:59] <newbye> how do I reffer to a link in a div?
[15:41:18] <newbye> the code looks like this: $('#aDiv.#here').click(function() {...}
[15:41:49] <newbye> i'm stucked at the "#here" part
[15:56:30] <KWhat4> does jquery have a way to apply an effect by string?  for example:  $('.myobj').effect('blind', ...)  ?
[15:57:16] <KWhat4> ohh never mind show and hide work
[16:04:31] <KWhat4> eh maybe that wont work
[16:05:16] <bobdobbs> I have this within document.read: http://jsfiddle.net/CqeVQ/ But I never get to the behaviours within the setTimeout block. Why could this be the case?
[16:05:47] <bobdobbs> firebug shows no errors
[16:14:46] <KWhat4> hmmm no one here?
[16:24:26] <lilmikey> hi
[16:24:38] <chee> hello
[16:26:39] <lilmikey> if I want a function to stop for i > 10, would this suffice:      if (i > 10) { return false; )
[16:26:40] <lilmikey> ?
[16:28:10] <__null> var i = 0; while (x < 10 ) { i++; }
[16:28:38] <lilmikey> you mean i < 10
[16:28:42] <lilmikey> ?
[16:28:43] <__null> yes
[16:28:46] <lilmikey> ok
[16:29:21] <JD-Robbs> Jeez,... I'm suffering my own feature creep....
[16:33:09] <lilmikey> __null: how exactly do I execute a while function? the argument i++, should it be at the end of the function?
[16:33:44] <lilmikey> __null: like: while (x < 10) { do.this; do.that; i++ } ?
[16:36:12] <Bankzilla> lilmikey: what are you trying to do? while and if statement both have their advantages
[16:38:16] <lilmikey> i am trying to set positions for divs on a rim of a circle. I have already done the maths, now just need to parse it in jquery. There will be 9 divs and their positions are relative to the previous ones. so basically, i need to run a function 9 times and want it to stop when i = 10
[16:39:32] <Bankzilla> then do if(i=0;i<=10;i++){ do function work here }
[16:39:54] <lilmikey> ok, thanks.
[16:40:03] <Bankzilla> that will make it if "i" is = or greater than 10 to not run
[16:40:14] <Bankzilla> so anything bellow that will be fine
[16:40:26] <Bankzilla> although you might want to start at i=1
[16:40:33] <Bankzilla> cause 0-9 is 10 times
[16:41:13] <lilmikey> yea.
[16:41:15] <FoolsRun> Hi, is there an event that I can listen for for when a checkbox is checked or unchecked but NOT NECESSARILY by a user click?
[16:41:54] <FoolsRun> I'm trying to fire off a function when a group of checkboxes is automatically checked or unchecked by a "master" checkbox, or when they're indiviaually checked or unchecked by the user
[16:43:13] <FoolsRun> .change doesn't do it, because like .click it requires the user to make the change
[16:44:39] <lilmikey> Bankzilla: I actually think that's a 'for' loop, not if
[16:45:11] <Bankzilla> lilmikey: yeah you're correct
[16:46:16] <Bankzilla> lilmikey: actually it should be for(i=0;i<10;i++){ .......... }
[16:46:25] <lilmikey> dreamweaver showed there was an error. But I will use that idea, so that's appreciated.
[16:46:26] <lilmikey> yea :)
[16:49:36] <Bankzilla> FoolsRun: Are the check boxing loaded automatically ticked?
[16:49:43] <Hopsy> coldhead: do you have a moment?
[16:49:48] <Bankzilla> If so you can't listen to them with an event cause it's already happened
[16:50:08] <coldhead> sure Hopsy
[16:50:35] <Hopsy> Well those last days I am in love with ECG's
[16:50:37] <FoolsRun>  Bankzilla: yes, but .change should still work, right?
[16:50:47] <Hopsy> I want to buy one
[16:51:13] <Bankzilla> FoolsRun: .change can't listen to something that isn't changed by something in the page
[16:51:13] <Hopsy> uhm, I have searched for some and found two neuroheadsets
[16:51:16] <coldhead> i think you should buy two, Hopsy
[16:51:25] <Hopsy> which one do you prefer me to buy
[16:51:45] <Bankzilla> FoolsRun: If they're already set on page load, you can do a function that checks if the boxes are :selected
[16:51:52] <Hopsy> haha, I would! but its too much money
[16:52:54] <FoolsRun> Bankzilla: I'm successfully able to listen for a user click both to check and uncheck (hide and unhide something), but not a jquery function that checks a bunch of checkboxes all at once.
[16:53:25] <FoolsRun> So there's no event that occurs when a checkbox is checked or unchecked, only when a user checks or unchecks them?
[16:55:54] <Bankzilla> FoolsRun: run something like $("form input:checkbox:").size(); then set a loop to check if they're selected
[16:56:25] <Bankzilla> can't remember if it's size() or length()
[16:56:55] <Bankzilla> Thats for if they're already selected on page load, then your event listeners will be able to tell if they change after that
[16:57:27] <Oli> Does jQ have a method for straight-up posting a form behind the scenes? eg $('form#my-form').post('ajaxurl/');
[16:57:43] <Oli> Or do I have to extract the data from the form and use $.post(...)?

[17:08:18] <takahiro> is there a way to detect when the ctrl key is pressed, but no click or other key is pressed?
[17:10:42] <Bankzilla> takahiro: http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[17:27:46] <takahiro> Bankzilla: yeah i used that, but it only detects actual keys like Ctrl-E, and Shift-E, but not "just" Ctrl
[17:27:55] <snover> takahiro: no
[17:28:47] <takahiro> $(document).keypress(function(event) { console.log(event); }); // no output when pressing "just" Ctrl
[17:29:46] <snover> takahiro use keydown
[17:32:26] <vIkSiT> hello all
[17:32:49] <vIkSiT> is there a way to not have $('foo').load(function() {..}); return anything?
[17:33:17] <vIkSiT> I'm using this call in a template, and the return value shows up as [object Object] in the template itself
[17:34:04] <rickup> Hey I have some code that works when pasted into the firebug console & run or on http://jsfiddle.net/imakewebthings/v2D6M/6/  but not on the actual page http://easywaas.com/locations/century-city-virtual-office
[17:34:45] <Bankzilla> vlKSiT so you want it to return nothing? then just delete the function?
[17:35:08] <takahiro> snover: ok
[17:35:55] <Bankzilla> rickup: are you authorised to view the page?
[17:36:03] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, hmm, thanks for the info - not sure how to delete that though? simple delete?
[17:36:12] <rickup> sorry login is guest pass is letmein
[17:36:49] <rickup> Thanks Bankzilla I keep forgetting its htpasswd protected
[17:36:56] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, I do something like this $('.my .selector').load(function() { window.myImageChangeFunction(); })
[17:37:31] <Bankzilla> vlkSiT: i think you might be looking for onload?
[17:37:35] <Bankzilla> instead of load
[17:37:45] <vIkSiT> hmm
[17:38:08] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, do you mean jquery has a .onload too?
[17:38:08] <Bankzilla> cause .load() is to load a external pages code
[17:38:12] <Bankzilla> yes
[17:38:23] <Bankzilla> oh its .ready()
[17:38:41] <vIkSiT> ah
[17:39:04] <Bankzilla> this will execute after the page has fully loaded
[17:39:25] <PaperBoy> Hi, im a noob, please help me. i need to create the  div strech effect like the "read more" lin..  i want it to show as it does now.. and expland to show the rest of the content...   but i dont want it fully hidden
[17:39:50] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, are you talking about $(document).ready()
[17:40:00] <vIkSiT> or is that for $('selectors').ready() ?
[17:41:36] <Bankzilla> vIkSiT: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[17:41:43] <rickup> I also see that I can eliminate  my $(document).ready(function() {  and paste the $('#edit-attributes-43 option').each(function() {..... part and it works
[17:41:47] <PaperBoy> any charitable people?
[17:42:38] <rickup> Does it have something to do with the state of the select itself?  Since the price doesn't show up  unless the Select is "open"
[17:42:48] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, that approach hasn't worked for me in the past.
[17:42:56] <vIkSiT> thats why i was trying to use an alternative method
[17:43:13] <Bankzilla> Your approach is that, when the page is fully loaded, you want your change images function to run?
[17:43:40] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, this is the order: a) I get json data, b) Render it using underscore.js, and c) change image function()
[17:43:55] <vIkSiT> there's a step between b and c where i do a $.html(renderedStuff)
[17:44:22] <vIkSiT> as part of c, I've tried document.ready, window.load, $('img selector').load(), et al - but none work reliably
[17:44:37] <Bankzilla> The json data would have a success return function? which would like to your custom plugin?
[17:44:47] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, the issue isn't with json
[17:44:57] <Bankzilla> I know, i'm just thinking of your approach
[17:45:07] <vIkSiT> the issue is with the images not being available in the dom when the image function fires..
[17:45:11] <Bankzilla> PaperBoy: you can just use a toggle, or set a height on .click()
[17:45:17] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, ah that way :) yes, you're right
[17:45:25] <vIkSiT> except - there's no JSON *call*
[17:45:29] <vIkSiT> its embedded into the page itself
[17:45:38] <vIkSiT> <script> myvar = {json}; </script>
[17:45:46] <Bankzilla> hm
[17:46:02] <vIkSiT> page is rendered server side with the json data already in there..
[17:46:14] <Bankzilla> where are the images coming from?
[17:46:18] <vIkSiT> all i need is is $('.my .selector').load(function() { window.myImageChangeFunction(); }) to not return anything
[17:46:25] <vIkSiT> images are external urls
[17:47:05] <Bankzilla> .load function calls for a external url, this is the function on jquery.com
[17:47:05] <Bankzilla> .load( url [, data] [, complete(responseText, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)] )
[17:48:15] <vIkSiT> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[17:48:28] <vIkSiT> this is the load event i'm talking about..
[17:48:49] <vIkSiT> its a shortcut for .bind('load', f() {})

[17:52:28] <abjorn> host chopper rules
[17:53:06] <imsky> before i gooo tell me
[17:53:52] <Bankzilla> vlkSiT: $('.my .selector').load(function() { window.myImageChangeFunction(null); })
[17:54:00] <Bankzilla> try that?
[17:54:45] <Bankzilla> Cause always in window.myImageChangeFunction put a return false; at the very end of it
[17:55:40] <vIkSiT> aah
[17:55:42] <vIkSiT> let me try that
[17:56:56] <vIkSiT> Bankzilla, the problem is that $('').load() itself returns the [object Object]
[17:57:14] <abjorn> sup imsky
[17:57:30] <imsky> solving linear algebra problems abjorn
[17:57:38] <abjorn> oh, word
[17:57:41] <imsky> i'm ears deep in null space bases
[17:57:45] <abjorn> i just put my computar into its new case

[17:59:45] <imsky> i'm doing k with the 8 i have
[17:59:46] <christo_m> hi cansomeone please help me with colission detection for this
[17:59:47] <christo_m> http://christomitov.com/pages/assign4
[17:59:51] <abjorn> but a 2x4GB G.Skill Sniper set were on sale for like $30 on black friday, i couldn't resist
[17:59:56] <christo_m> im using gamequery, and cant figure out how to use the collision function.
[17:59:58] <abjorn> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231416
[17:59:59] <imsky> i think upgrades should be >=100%
[18:00:05] <imsky> otherwise it's a waste of money
[18:00:29] <imsky> that's some fast rams
[18:00:34] <imsky> and cheap, jesus
[18:00:42] <imsky> i remember when a gig was $120+
[18:02:00] <christo_m> Can someone just give it a quick look maybe im missing something
[18:03:18] <christo_m> imsky: ?
[18:03:27] <imsky> wat
[18:03:33] <christo_m> any gamequery exp
[18:03:33] <abjorn> lol yeah
[18:03:43] <abjorn> supafast ramz
[18:03:50] <christo_m> dat ra
[18:03:52] <christo_m> ram*
[18:04:26] <imsky> what are you babbling about
[18:04:36] <christo_m> http://christomitov.com/pages/assign4
[18:04:41] <christo_m> trying to do collision detection
[18:05:04] <christo_m> line 133
[18:05:17] <imsky> and you somehow missed the million or so tutorials with source code on how to do this in flash?
[18:05:23] <imsky> ?g collision detection kirupa
[18:05:24] <bot-t> imsky, kirupa.com - Collision Detection Among Multiple Objects - http://www.kirupa.com/developer/actionscript/multiple_collision.htm
[18:05:37] <christo_m> theres a built in method for the API
[18:05:48] <imsky> awesome lol
[18:05:50] <christo_m> http://gamequery.onaluf.org/api.php#collision
[18:05:54] <christo_m> right, except it isnt working
[18:06:10] <christo_m> im new to javascript and jquery/gamequery
[18:06:30] <imsky> so if you're new to javascript, and jquery, and gamequery
[18:06:36] <imsky> and collision detection apparently
[18:06:43] <imsky> ...the question is why
[18:06:49] <christo_m> to learn.
[18:06:59] <christo_m> im sure you didnt know what the rank nullity theorem was before you started lin alg
[18:07:08] <christo_m> so if you could not be so elitist to a beginner, thatd be awesome
[18:07:10] <abjorn> man the inside of my computer is such a mess of wires
[18:07:15] <imsky> you actually just made my point
[18:07:24] <imsky> you are 4 levels deep into "don't know shit" and you want help
[18:07:37] <christo_m> actually, if you even glanced at the code
[18:07:50] <christo_m> youd see that the 1 level im stuck on is the collision, everything else is fine
[18:07:56] <christo_m> which was my original question
[18:08:12] <imsky> lol i'm gonna love seeing you around, 2 weeks from now, asking how to do things that gamequery doesn't do
[18:08:19] <imsky> pls sir my gaems
[18:08:32] <christo_m> apparently the collision function in gamequery gives you an array of all the objects the selected element is colliding with
[18:08:51] <christo_m> lol, gamequery does collision detection, in the api, that i linked you
[18:09:06] <imsky> do you know how most game engines do collision detection? with bounding boxes?
[18:09:11] <christo_m> yes
[18:09:14] <imsky> how?
[18:09:24] <christo_m> well you can use spheres or circles also
[18:09:33] <imsky> yeah i know about that, but what's the process?
[18:09:41] <vIkSiT> okay. I'm at my wits end now :) Is there a reliable way to detect when images have all appeared in the dom, even if they're being rendered by JS templates?
[18:09:51] <imsky> vIkSiT: try imagesloaded
[18:10:18] <christo_m> but for bounding box, pretty sure for something like this, checking superimposition of theboxes is sufficient
[18:10:32] <imsky> and how is this check done, do you think
[18:10:38] <vIkSiT> imsky, ah thanks. let me check
[18:10:55] <christo_m> i dont see what this has to do with anything
[18:11:01] <christo_m> as the actual method is abstracted as per the API, again
[18:11:04] <imsky> yeah because you don't know the answer
[18:11:22] <christo_m> no, i dont know how this particular engine implemented its collision detection
[18:11:29] <Bankzilla> $(window).load(
[18:11:29] <Bankzilla> function() {// weave your magic here.});
[18:11:35] <Bankzilla> vlkSiT: try that
[18:11:36] <imsky> if you can't code your example without jquery and gamequery, you have no business writing code
[18:11:46] <christo_m> ah i see
[18:11:48] <imsky> you're just trying to shortcut a bunch of shit
[18:11:57] <christo_m> do you write your own .toggle or slideDown methods? or do you just rely on the implementation
[18:12:04] <christo_m> lol ok
[18:12:15] <imsky> you admitted you don't know either js or jquery or even mostly gamequery
[18:12:21] <imsky> and you don't even know the basics of collision detection
[18:12:28] <christo_m> yes
[18:12:34] <christo_m> can you harp on me some more for trying to learn?
[18:12:39] <imsky> so...you just wander inside a new language, framework, and app, and inside a basic game engine technique
[18:12:44] <christo_m> yes, i do
[18:12:46] <imsky> and without knowing which way is up, want assistance
[18:13:02] <christo_m> no, i want an explanation of why the collision method isnt workingthe way its described
[18:13:08] <imsky> ok
[18:13:11] <imsky> read the gamequery source
[18:13:13] <imsky> you'll see why
[18:13:16] <christo_m> i didnt ask for bigotry,elitism, or life advice
[18:13:28] <snover> gentlemen.
[18:13:36] <imsky> lol bigotry
[18:14:31] <christo_m> imsky: im not going to tear apart the source code to see how its done, just as in real life, people dont have time to check how the API is implemented, they rely on it working
[18:14:41] <imsky> you're serious
[18:14:52] <imsky> because open source literally exists for this kind of situation
[18:14:54] <snover> actually, usually people do read the source code when something is not working and they can’t figure out why
[18:14:57] <imsky> ^
[18:15:04] <imsky> i've cracked open jquery many times
[18:15:06] <abjorn> *usually good programmers
[18:15:07] <abjorn> fix'd
[18:15:16] <imsky> * usually not intellectually lazy people
[18:15:22] <imsky> fix'd++
[18:15:23] <abjorn> same thing
[18:15:24] <snover> don’t pile on, guys.
[18:15:30] <christo_m> the assignments due tmw
[18:15:32] <Bankzilla> fixed* ++
[18:15:35] <imsky> yeah no kidding
[18:15:39] <imsky> we're doing your HOMEWORK for you
[18:15:40] <imsky> lmao
[18:15:42] <christo_m> lol
[18:15:43] <imsky> sorry snover
[18:15:47] <abjorn> wait, this is an assignment?
[18:15:48] <snover> it’s ok
[18:15:49] <abjorn> lol wat
[18:15:51] <christo_m> its actually done, save for collision detection
[18:15:55] <christo_m> the assignment isnt collision detection
[18:15:59] <christo_m> its just to implement a game
[18:16:01] <abjorn> well i figured that
[18:16:13] <abjorn> does it require you to do it in gamequery?
[18:16:16] <christo_m> no
[18:16:22] <christo_m> but ive done so much in gamequery already, id rather stick with it
[18:16:26] <abjorn> is there something you'd know better than js/jquery/gamequery?
[18:16:42] <christo_m> okay
[18:16:48] <abjorn> I'm just asking
[18:16:49] <christo_m> instead of suggestions cansomeone please just look at the offending line
[18:16:52] <christo_m> andtell me if im doing something wrong
[18:17:03] <abjorn> I can look, but I've never used gamequery, so no guarantees
[18:17:08] <christo_m> http://gamequery.onaluf.org/api.php#collision
[18:17:17] <christo_m> http://christomitov.com/pages/assign4
[18:17:28] <snover> christo_m: if it is not working, chances are high you are doing something wrong :)
[18:17:36] <christo_m> ..yes
[18:17:48] <christo_m> the idea of the game is that
[18:17:48] <abjorn> ...wise...wise advice, snover
[18:17:51] <christo_m> pressing spacebar
[18:18:02] <christo_m> toggles the light, you're trying to avoid collisions at theintersection
[18:18:05] <abjorn> but do you actually know what line is the problem?
[18:18:08] <imsky> i like how this guy dropped rank nullity theorem out of nowhere
[18:18:21] <christo_m> you said you were studying lin alg
[18:18:24] <christo_m> basic lin alg at that
[18:18:36] <christo_m> dont worry i get it, you're better than me because you know jquery thoroughly
[18:18:51] <Bankzilla> Nah he's just a real prick
[18:19:06] <christo_m> thats also obvious
[18:19:11] <snover> gentlemen.
[18:19:16] <imsky> bahaha
[18:19:30] <Bankzilla> Snover: Should more likely be ladies, with all the bickering ;)
[18:19:38] <imsky> oh man you're on fire bankzilla
[18:19:57] <abjorn> Okay, so I'm guessing the issue is that nothing happens when the cars collide, christo_m.
[18:20:04] <christo_m> abjorn: right
[18:20:10] <christo_m> im basically using an alert for debugging
[18:20:15] <christo_m> just to see if the array ever grows in size
[18:20:23] <imsky> loool
[18:20:30] <abjorn> this isn't important, but try using console.log instead of alert
[18:20:50] <abjorn> just a suggestion, most people prefer console.log
[18:20:58] <abjorn> anyways
[18:21:00] <imsky> not that alert() blocks execution or anything
[18:21:01] <abjorn> lemme take a lewksie
[18:21:05] <christo_m> how does that work
[18:21:05] <christo_m> with firebug im ssuming?
[18:21:16] <abjorn> yes, or other method sin other browers
[18:21:18] <Bankzilla> If you're running multiple alerts, you'll get highly sick of clicking to close them all. Console.log() is considering a more professional approach.
[18:21:19] <abjorn> its built into webkit
[18:21:21] <christo_m> thank you for the suggestion btw and not immediately scorning me for not understanding something
[18:21:42] <Bankzilla> christo_m What browser do you use
[18:21:49] <christo_m> well, chrome
[18:22:00] <christo_m> im not *too* concerned with cross browser compatibility
[18:22:05] <christo_m> if chrome and firefox work then good
[18:22:16] <christo_m> most of my dev is in firefox because i like its firebug extension better
[18:22:44] <Bankzilla> If you right click and open inspect element. Under the elements tab. At the very bottom, second from left will open console
[18:22:54] <christo_m> yes
[18:22:55] <imsky> F12
[18:22:56] <christo_m> i use that
[18:22:58] <snover> ?alert
[18:22:58] <bot-t> Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[18:23:00] <christo_m> console doesnt give any errors
[18:23:10] <snover> Bankzilla: ^
[18:24:04] <Bankzilla> You can open jconsole somehow in chrome, which is easier to use that console. It's something like ctrl + shift + k
[18:24:24] <christo_m> well, its not getting in that branch regardless
[18:24:25] <christo_m> so
[18:25:40] <christo_m> abjorn: did you see line 129, what im talking about
[18:25:49] <abjorn> yeah
[18:25:51] <christo_m> i referred to the documentation and im pretty sure im using it correctly
[18:26:00] <christo_m> i actually would like to generalize it to sprites in the computerCars grou
[18:26:00] <abjorn> from the looks of it, yeah
[18:26:02] <christo_m> group*
[18:26:04] <christo_m> such would be ideal
[18:26:10] <abjorn> you try console.log(typeof collided) ?
[18:26:21] <christo_m> where, in the if?
[18:26:21] <christo_m> 1 se
[18:26:45] <abjorn> well, just after var collided = $(this).collision(".carEast");
[18:26:55] <abjorn> to make sure you've got the value you're expecting
[18:27:02] <christo_m> its an object
[18:29:14] <christo_m> abjorn: shouldnt it be more specfic and tell me its a list object
[18:29:20] <abjorn> nah
[18:29:20] <christo_m> or is object sufficient to derive that
[18:29:28] <christo_m> hmm
[18:29:31] <abjorn> typeof doesn't really get that specific
[18:30:03] <abjorn> typeof is pretty much like "well, it's either an object, array, string, number, NaN, or undefined"
[18:30:41] <christo_m> ah i see
[18:30:45] <christo_m> well, any other idea
[18:30:57] <christo_m> i was using this as reference,besides the tut on the site
[18:31:04] <christo_m> http://www.washdryfold.com/gamequery/
[18:31:22] <abjorn> well
[18:31:27] <abjorn> if it's an object, and length is 0
[18:31:32] <abjorn> then you're using the lib wrong somehow
[18:31:40] <abjorn> im not familiar with it, so honestly idk
[18:31:52] <abjorn> it's not an error in syntax or logic so, just using the lib wrong
[18:32:16] <christo_m> well if you look at his example
[18:32:28] <christo_m> he checks if each missile is colliding with the #victim div
[18:32:43] <christo_m> im just checking if i collide with any .carEast object
[18:32:51] <christo_m> in the same fashion
[18:36:38] <christo_m> abjorn: ah i got it
[18:36:48] <abjorn> kewl, what was it
[18:36:57] <christo_m> i needed to specify group also
[18:37:09] <christo_m> the deceiving thing about the guys example was that all the sprites are in one group
[18:37:10] <abjorn> no idea what you mean, but cool
[18:37:18] <christo_m> var collided = $(this).collision(".carEast,#computerCars");
[18:37:31] <christo_m> group is justa collection of sprites
[18:37:38] <christo_m> like a node in the scenegraph
[18:37:55] <christo_m> at least from what i understand,maybe imsky can chime in and crush my dreams for a moment
[18:38:07] <abjorn> imsky is far from caring
[18:38:11] <christo_m> abjorn: thank you for your help
[18:38:15] <abjorn> what help?
[18:38:18] <abjorn> lol
[18:38:19] <christo_m> console.log
[18:38:20] <christo_m> :)
[18:38:24] <abjorn> i guess
[18:39:07] <imsky> how's proto going abjorn
[18:39:29] <abjorn> I put it back on hiatus, so I can make actual games instead of working on a game engine.
[18:39:51] <imsky> oh yeah you're making that game with impact
[18:39:54] <imsky> how's that going
[18:39:55] <abjorn> yeah
[18:40:10] <abjorn> slowly, I used to make game art all the time but for some reason I hate doing it now
[18:40:18] <imsky> hire someone
[18:40:25] <abjorn> with what money?
[18:40:29] <imsky> http://fiverr.com
[18:40:30] <imsky> $5
[18:40:40] <imsky> DRAW ME SUM EMENIES
[18:40:40] <abjorn> lol
[18:41:05] <abjorn> actually, I got a friend who is an amazing pixel artist who is going to help me once he's done with his current project
[18:41:11] <abjorn> he gets paid to do it all the time
[18:41:15] <imsky> that's what's up
[18:41:19] <imsky> are you making a retro styled game?
[18:41:24] <imsky> the whole 8 bit shit

[18:53:12] * imsky wigglos
[18:53:18] <runvnc> yes
[18:53:20] * abjorn wigglarz
[18:53:55] <imsky> i like youtube's new design
[18:54:05] <abjorn> me2
[18:54:12] <imsky> i think we'll see a lot of non-white backgrounds in the future
[18:54:13] <abjorn> google must have some real designers now
[18:54:17] <imsky> yeah they do
[18:54:22] <imsky> they employed that dude that worked for apple
[18:54:27] <abjorn> oh, word
[18:54:34] <abjorn> then why isn't it shiny and chrome?
[18:54:35] <imsky> that searing white
[18:54:38] <imsky> hmm
[18:54:39] <imsky> well
[18:54:47] <imsky> apple itself is moving away from the shiny and chrome stuff
[18:54:51] <imsky> haven't you seen apple?
[18:54:52] <abjorn> BRUSHED METAL
[18:54:56] <imsky> yeah
[18:55:03] <imsky> no, if you want to see some real shit
[18:55:06] <imsky> look at osx 10.0
[18:55:09] <imsky> and then the upgrades
[18:55:14] <abjorn> lol
[18:55:19] <imsky> they killed the shiny/chromey stuff a long time ago
[18:55:41] <imsky> since '07 they've been pushing for flat, gray, slightly raised
[18:55:51] <imsky> google's 4 years late as usual
[18:56:03] <imsky> but it's a good redesign :D
[18:56:08] <imsky> plus their html5 player is nice
[18:56:11] <vIkSiT> man. loading images on browsers is complex
[18:56:20] <abjorn> google's like "I don't give no fuck about design"
[18:56:25] <imsky> they really don't
[18:56:26] <abjorn> then a few months ago "okay we design now"
[18:56:33] <imsky> it's all part of a bigger plan
[18:56:40] <abjorn> brb im hungree
[18:56:48] <imsky> get on with it you mexican
[19:04:10] <abjorn> you expect too much from me imsky

[19:53:17] <imsky> abjorn: i'm out bro, later
[19:58:20] <christo_m> abjorn: are you there?
[19:58:39] <enerel> anyone used YoxView?
[20:07:37] <brianpWins> If i have a container for of form elements. and bind 'focus' to the container. is there still a way to catch which form element the focus came from ?
[20:08:57] <cloaked1> is jquery.tablesorter.js a quirky library? I'm having a serious struggle getting it to work at all.
[20:19:05] <mp___> halp. jquery ui slider. on my slide event, slightly off values are reported in the .slider('values') call. calling .slider('values') _after_ the slide gives me the correct values.
[20:29:30] <balr0g> whats the best way to highlight a menu item according to the actual page??
[20:30:31] <takahiro> you can add a style class like 'active'
[20:31:18] <balr0g> takahiro, hmm.. will try it..
[20:32:32] <loconut> hello- I have a page with 3 tabs. At the bottom of the tabs are an update and a cancel button. The first two tabs absolutely must be submitted together, but the 3rd tab has several independent ajax upload (to iframe) forms and cannot be nested in the parent form. Can I somehow make a set of proxy controls that submit the actual hidden forms somewhere else? Eg can I have a visible file input that sets the file input in another form?
[20:43:40] <Hypah> $(myDiv).mouseover() is being ignored when i add a canvas to that div. any workaround for that?
[20:48:02] <b1lly> Hypah: that don't make sense?
[20:48:20] <b1lly> Hypah: i don't think it should do that
[20:58:06] <Hypah> sorry, you are correct
[20:58:22] <Hypah> it was a problem with my own code, no surprises there
[20:58:47] <coldhead> it is ever thus
[21:03:17] <Ukto> Hello, I am trying to find a solution. On my site I have a table, that data is pulled from a database. I am looking for a plugin or something that will constantly check for, and update by either inserting or removeing a row on the fly. Suggestions?
[21:09:13] <hightekvagabond> Ukto, you aren't likely to find a stock plugin that does that because it needs to be coordinated with your server side application… it wouldn't be that hard to custom write though…. just use setTimeOut to rerun your update function every 30 seconds or so
[21:17:48] <krogant> .exit
[21:18:03] <JesperA> nice jerb krogant

[22:04:58] <tomv_415_> I am testing the obJ.load(href) function, and it seems to be broken on chrome.  Anyone familar with this?  is it an issue?
[22:05:31] <tomv_415_> I am loading *local* files, not over http, but page is local, so the protocol and 'server' are the same.  Works in FF and IE.
[22:08:22] <spersaud> I have a div that is show when a link is shown via a custom showdiv function .. this is for a navigation menu
[22:08:37] <spersaud> I want to corner it using jquery plugin how do I do this ?
[22:08:51] <spersaud> can I corner all divs when page is first loaded ? help
[22:08:59] <spersaud> its not getting cornered
[22:11:21] <JesperA> cornered?
[22:11:38] <tomv_415_> (rounded corners?)(
[22:11:43] <spersaud> tomv_415_: yes
[22:11:47] <JesperA> css
[22:11:52] <spersaud> using jquery.corner.js
[22:12:04] <spersaud> how do you corner a div with css ?
[22:12:22] <JesperA> border-radius: 8px;
[22:13:36] <coldhead> #css
[22:15:20] <spersaud> coldhead: :/
[22:15:27] <spersaud> JesperA: thats not working
[22:15:36] <JesperA> yes it does
[22:16:02] <JesperA> what browser are you using?
[22:17:01] <dr0id> IE6
[22:17:15] <JesperA> http://jsfiddle.net/HvpDv/
[22:17:29] <spersaud> JesperA: Iceweasel
[22:17:31] <coldhead> http://css3please.com/ the very first item there does all your rounded corner work
[22:17:46] <coldhead> with a smile
[22:17:48] <dr0id> lol
[22:17:57] <tomv_415_> Any tips for my problem with chrome failing on $("myDiv").load('localfile.html #infobox")  where Firefox and IE do just fine?  How to debug?  What's a good workaround?
[22:18:34] <JesperA> spersaud suit yourself then....
[22:18:42] <JesperA> why not use a real browser?
[22:19:06] <JesperA> "cute icon"
[22:19:06] <coldhead> tomv_415_: perhaps the html is not valid? that could cause different browsers to handle it differently
[22:19:08] <spersaud> spersaud: which one ?
[22:19:16] <spersaud> -moz-border-radius: :)
[22:19:22] <spersaud> JesperA: which one is that ?
[22:19:26] <dr0id> use Internet Explorer 5.5
[22:19:32] <JesperA> which on is that? what?
[22:19:34] <spersaud> dr0id: hahaha
[22:19:45] <tomv_415_> colhead - thanks for the suggestion.  I will look at that now.  The html is pretty plain vanilla, but you never know.
[22:19:58] <spersaud> JesperA: you are a quack of the highest kind :))))
[22:20:09] <JesperA> ??
[22:20:20] <dr0id> heh
[22:27:05] <tomv_415_> coldhead: Found a seeminly irreleant issues with the file I"m loading, but after cleaning them up, still didn't work..
[22:28:46] <tomv_415_> coldhead: Ah, found the chrome issue, "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."   Hm... any work arounds?
[22:35:56] <matt5> http://dpaste.de/mdxMS/
[22:36:15] <matt5> loading that page should give me a bold 'jQuery', should it not?
[22:37:25] <coldhead> looks like it
[22:38:17] <matt5> it sort of doesn't, I wonder why
[22:38:25] <coldhead> you have too many });s
[22:38:42] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/CnR9L/
[22:38:46] <coldhead> it works there
[22:38:54] <matt5> oh yes, thank you
[22:38:55] <coldhead> with the extra }); removed
[23:02:35] <mxp> Does jquery support CORS request for IE8?
[23:06:49] <JesperA> how do i change <img data-original="cake.jpg" to img src="cake.jpg"?
[23:08:31] <coldhead> var $img = $('img'); var orig = $img.data('original'); $img.attr('src', orig);
[23:11:17] <shesek> that'll change all the images to the data-original attribute of the first image
[23:12:00] <shesek> unless you're working with one specific image, you probably want $('img[data-original]').each(function(){ $(this).attr('src', $(this).data('original')); })
[23:12:04] <mxp> anyone
[23:12:11] <mxp> CORS support for IE8?
[23:12:41] <coldhead> shesek: you just invented all these other images and ruined my solution!
[23:12:54] <coldhead> i hope you're satisfied
[23:13:02] <shesek> :-)
[23:13:04] <shesek> sorry mate :P
[23:13:24] <shesek> mxp, that probably depends on IE8, not jQuery
[23:13:28] <shesek> if IE8 supports it, it should work
[23:13:51] <mxp> shesek: doing $.ajax on cross domain will automatically handle it?
[23:14:09] <shesek> AFAIK, yes - but I might be wrong on this
[23:14:41] <shesek> haven't used it yet myself, but I assume (?) its support be jQuery's $.ajax
[23:14:52] <shesek> sorry for not being more helpful, I'm pretty much just guessing :P
[23:16:22] <marshy> sup shesek
[23:16:31] <marshy> mxp: CORS works
[23:16:44] <shesek> * its supported by
[23:16:51] <shesek> great, how are you?
[23:16:53] <marshy> but i don't think ajax uses CORS
[23:16:59] <marshy> $.ajax
[23:17:09] <shesek> someone been looking for you the other day
[23:17:15] <shesek> can't remember who tho :O
[23:17:31] <marshy> lol
[23:18:01] <marshy> i take that back. any browser that supports cors will check for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header from the remote server
[23:18:08] <marshy> IE8 yes, but not IE7 unfortunately
[23:18:39] <mxp> marshy: IE8 has seperate object for xhr request for CORS
[23:18:47] <mxp> has jquery wrapped it in ajax?
[23:18:52] <shesek> mxp, you need to set `withCredentials` to true in the options passed to XmlHttpRequest, which can be set using the `xhrFields` option to $.ajax
[23:19:20] <marshy> if you need to support IE7, check out Easy XDM
[23:20:25] <mxp> marshy: I am not gona support IE7 shit
[23:20:55] <shesek> mxp, jQuery doesn't seem to support XDomainRequest
[23:21:00] <shesek> (no mention of it in the source)
[23:24:33] <Cork> shesek: jquery doesn't really do any atemts to support (real) cross domain ajax requests
[23:25:30] <shesek> Cork, well, on real browsers it doesn't really require anything special, just that passing that withCredentials option
[23:25:53] <Cork> shesek: on real browsers?
[23:26:10] <Cork> no cross domain is blocked unless you proviced csp
[23:26:25] <Cork> and thats a server header
[23:26:33] <Cork> if uses the XDomainRequest though
[23:26:36] <Cork> *ie
[23:26:41] <marshy> yeah the server has to return  Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
[23:26:55] <marshy> that works in ie8+
[23:27:13] <shesek> of course it requires the server to explicitly tell the browser he's okay with it - it'll be a serious security risk otherwise
[23:27:38] <shesek> but still, it works well in all the browsers other than IE
[23:27:59] <marshy> it should work in ie8
[23:28:06] <marshy> and above
[23:28:13] <shesek> Microsoft surprisingly decided to add its own weird object instead of working with the regular XmlHttpRequest, like all the other browser vendors did
[23:28:27] <shesek> which also has a slightly different API
[23:28:38] <Cork> shesek: xdomainrequest came before csp
[23:29:31] <shesek> oh, didn't know that
[23:29:47] <marshy> oops
[23:29:51] <marshy> looks like im wrong
[23:29:52] <marshy> :)
[23:29:56] <Cork> ie was the first browser to support a way to do cross domain requests
[23:29:58] <shesek> did they add for cross-domain requests in XmlHttpRequest at some version ?
[23:30:06] <Cork> no
[23:30:26] <Cork> well
[23:30:42] <Cork> actually yes, the first implementation of xhr was cross domain :)
[23:30:48] <Cork> the block was added later
[23:30:54] <marshy> looks like EasyXDM may be the best option
[23:31:00] <Cork> but i don't think that was your question ;)
[23:31:30] <shesek> really? that sounds extremely stupid oO
[23:32:10] <Cork> shesek: csp is still farly new, and before that there wasn't a way to support cross domain except with jsonp
[23:32:33] <Cork> shesek: it'll most likly come within time
[23:32:49] <Cork> btw http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8283
[23:32:52] <shesek> yeah, I know
[23:33:00] <shesek> and I saw the ticket
[23:33:24] <shesek> I wonder why they don't add it? No one from the core team seem to have written any good reason
[23:33:37] <shesek> or anyone else, really
[23:34:41] <Cork> shesek: prob low prio, cause it has the demand for it is low
[23:35:41] <shesek> low priority enough to be delayed for almost a year?
[23:36:01] <Cork> wouldn't be supriced if it ended up several years
