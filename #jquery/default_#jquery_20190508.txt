[02:25:18] <nisseni> I'm making a change to a form based on a choice the user makes. This is made with $.post and then I add the new form input via html(data). However, when I later serialize the form the new inputs aren't present. Can this be fixed somehow?
[02:48:10] <Cork> nisseni: .html() is that including the form tag?
[02:48:31] <Cork> meaning are you replacing the old formtag
[02:51:02] <nisseni> Cork: seems like the new code was put outside the ending form tag. So it's resolved now. :)
[02:51:06] <nisseni> Thanks!
[08:20:41] <Duikb00t> oi
[08:27:19] <Duikb00t> How can I prevent with jQuery a VueJS from rendering
[08:27:28] <Duikb00t> VueJS component.
[08:27:46] <Duikb00t> As not rendering.
[08:29:09] <pavonia> $("#elem").hide() is one way
[08:31:06] <Duikb00t> Yeah but then the element is still rendering.
[08:32:04] <pavonia> You can also remove it from the DOM with .remove()
[08:47:05] <Cork> wait... the element is rendering after you run .hide() on it??
[08:47:33] <Cork> are you sure your targeting the correct selector?
[08:52:22] <Duikb00t> Hmz
[08:52:26] <Duikb00t> yes targetting - correct
[08:52:34] <Duikb00t> The vue element (is a plugin) thingy
[08:55:48] <Cork> ya, but if you set style="display: none" and it still is visible then it has to either trigger on dom changes or possibly have a display: <somehting>!important in the css
[09:06:11] <Duikb00t> IToh
[09:06:13] <Duikb00t> oh
[09:06:18] <Duikb00t> Let me check.
[10:59:38] <mydog2> hi... curious. within jquery is there a str_compare(str1,str2) kind of function??  or do most simply use the javascript contains func?
[11:02:43] <Cork> mydog2: if you just want to check if two strings are the same just do str1 == str2
[11:04:27] <mydog2> Cork,  -- oops.. mybad.. i was looking for str2 in str1
[11:04:41] <Cork> .indexOf()
[11:05:23] <Cork> or .includes() if you have a modern browsers
[11:05:40] <Cork> * have modern browsers
[13:12:15] <saba> Am I correct that jQuery migrate doesn't support the last 2-3 minor releases?
[13:12:41] <robertmaxrees> it should.
[13:12:46] <robertmaxrees> what issues are you seeing?
[13:13:17] <Jasein> Simple Question: how can I setup a handler to catch click events outside of my menu? https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/QRjmdP
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> Jasein bind to document and then see if $(e.target).closest('.yourMenu')
[13:14:26] <robertmaxrees> saba are you seeing an issue?
[13:17:34] <saba> robertmaxrees: yes, it doesn't log that .isWindow(), .now() et al are deprecated
[13:17:46] <saba> robertmaxrees: and the latest release was in sept 2017 (?)
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> nooo....
[13:18:06] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery migrate are you using?
[13:18:10] <saba> 3.0.1
[13:18:12] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-migrate-plugin
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> your code needs to be compat with jquery 1.9
[13:18:59] <saba> robertmaxrees: it's compatible with jQuery 3.2.1
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> if you still think you're seeing problems, file a bug at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues
[13:19:55] <saba> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/releases , is that the wrong release page?
[13:20:00] <robertmaxrees> not sure.
[13:20:06] <robertmaxrees> you may be right :)
[13:20:27] <robertmaxrees> coulda sworn there's been a more recent release.
[13:20:44] <robertmaxrees> either way - file a bug if you think you found an issue :)
[13:21:05] <saba> I hope there will be some time before 4.0 :-)
[13:22:04] <robertmaxrees> are you actively migrating your code over?
[13:24:29] <Jasein> How do I turn off a click binding after a click? I thought $(document).off('click') would work, but it doesn't.
[13:24:49] <robertmaxrees> Jasein i wouldn't do that.
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> avoid juggling event handlers.
[13:25:53] <Jasein> How can I do that. Thanks for your help, I don't know how to close a popup menu if something outside of it is clicked. I tried using :focus but that didn't work
[13:26:35] <robertmaxrees> i explained it above.
[13:28:11] <Jasein> Wait, you are suggesting that I use the equivalent of .live, right? isn't it a terrible idea to bind all menu events to document?
[13:28:15] <robertmaxrees> Jasein to clarify - bind to document and then see if $(e.target).closest('.yourMenu').length
[13:28:16] <robertmaxrees> no
[13:28:20] <robertmaxrees> *sigh
[13:28:26] <Jasein> sorry,
[13:28:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm suggesting.
[13:28:31] <robertmaxrees> you bind one listener to do this.
[13:28:39] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[13:30:14] <Jasein> no problem. I more than likely suffer from the "over use of preventDefault" complaint you have made earlier. I'll keep working on it. Thanks for your help.
[14:31:23] <madprops> anybody here deals with jquerycontextmenu?
[14:31:31] <madprops> just had a bad time trying to make it don't show up if no items are visible
[14:33:28] <robertmaxrees> did you need some help? :)
[14:43:15] <madprops> robertmaxrees, i could have used some help
[14:43:23] <madprops> i ctrl+z'd everything
[14:43:25] <robertmaxrees> super confused madprops lol
[14:43:33] <madprops> but basically i was trying to build ... the build object
[14:43:38] <madprops> or function
[14:43:43] <madprops> but callback was never being called
[14:43:57] <madprops> not even sure if it would work
[14:44:11] <robertmaxrees> without having docs or an example in front of me dunno what you're referencing but bummer :(
[14:44:25] <madprops> https://swisnl.github.io/jQuery-contextMenu/docs.html#build
[14:44:45] <madprops> i used that structure, but callback was never called
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see your code.
[14:45:40] <madprops> https://paste.merkoba.com/1557341141-govopa-1
[14:46:25] <robertmaxrees> weird.  dunno.
[16:09:00] <bigBaby11> hello?
[16:09:13] <robertmaxrees> there are people here.
[16:09:22] <bigBaby11> hi
[16:09:29] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[16:16:00] <z1haze> how does one select multiple selectors, with one of them using find?
[16:16:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.foo, .bar .baz, qux') ?
[16:16:29] <z1haze> eg want to select $myEl.find('.something') and just globally looking for '
[16:16:34] <z1haze> '.some-other-class'
[16:16:41] <robertmaxrees> can you show a fiddle?
[16:17:55] <z1haze> making now
[16:19:20] <z1haze> something like this https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/xngj67w5/2/
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .add() in this case.
[16:20:16] <z1haze> $(this).find('[type=submit]').add('.js-submit') ?
[16:20:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:20:40] <z1haze> cool, thank you
[16:20:46] <robertmaxrees> though that's kind of a strange thing to want to do.
[16:21:01] <robertmaxrees> any reason your form doesn't also wrap the button?
[16:21:17] <z1haze> yeah, mostly layout reasons
[16:21:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:21:33] <robertmaxrees> you could replace the form with a div for layout.,
[16:21:53] <z1haze> im saying that have positions of extra submit buttons that are out of flow
[16:22:06] <robertmaxrees> confused but alright :)
[16:22:18] <z1haze> eg all of the forms are in the main container of the site on the left primary container, and they want an extra submit button tucked away in the right side of the page which is a completely separate area
[16:22:34] <z1haze> im not grossed out by this i feel its normal
[16:22:59] <robertmaxrees> 'k :)
[16:23:50] <z1haze> https://www.dropbox.com/s/bqiye2mpvrglqrn/layout.PNG?dl=0
[16:23:58] <z1haze> all  blow arrows are separate forms
[16:24:08] <robertmaxrees> okie.
[16:24:27] <z1haze> k w/e
[16:24:29] <z1haze> ty
[17:01:28] <bigBaby11> hello?
[17:01:37] <robertmaxrees> still here.  did you have a question?
[17:01:46] <bigBaby11> yea
[17:02:26] <robertmaxrees> aaand that would be...??? lol
[17:03:25] <bigBaby11> I am working on Data-tables i have a JSON data from which i am creating a HTML table. I have some requirements for that i am using data-tables what my issue is i am using data-table fixed-columns to fix my column but the table is not rendering correctly
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> "not rendering correctly" how?
[17:04:01] <bigBaby11> are you able to help me
[17:04:20] <robertmaxrees> without a test case it's very hard to assist, especially when you're being vague.
[17:05:02] <bigBaby11> wow ok
[17:05:12] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:05:45] <robertmaxrees> https://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions :)
[17:10:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:43:58] <milos__> Hello. Why would I get `jQuery.Deferred exception: $(...).dialog is not a function TypeError` in my script, when I made sure jquery is loaded before jquery ui?
[18:44:07] <milos__> are there any other known reasons?
[18:44:27] <robertmaxrees> are you including jquery multiple times?
[18:45:13] <milos__> robertmaxrees, nope, I double-checked
[18:45:27] <robertmaxrees> and nothing is 404ing for scripts?
[18:45:36] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise erroring.
[18:45:44] <milos__> nope, I only get one warning and one error
[18:46:30] <milos__> robertmaxrees, http://i.imgur.com/iyiOL1Q.png
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the page thing
[18:48:50] <milos__> whole source?
[18:49:00] <robertmaxrees> how much we talkin'?
[18:49:10] <milos__> would show page source from within chrome context menu work?
[18:49:19] <robertmaxrees> we can start there.
[18:49:26] <milos__> 500 lines
[18:49:30] <robertmaxrees> we can start there.
[18:49:47] <milos__> robertmaxrees, https://hastebin.com/xivivoxana.xml
[18:50:22] <robertmaxrees> line 44.
[18:50:25] <milos__> robertmaxrees, line 259 is my script
[18:50:31] <robertmaxrees> needs to come after jquery
[18:51:05] <milos__> robertmaxrees, I can't affect that. that's a plug-in
[18:51:15] <robertmaxrees> that's what's causing your error.
