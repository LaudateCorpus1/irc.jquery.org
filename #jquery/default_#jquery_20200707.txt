[05:38:00] <codecutter> how do i enable EventSource for IE?
[05:38:16] <codecutter> its not supported out of the box.
[05:40:10] <Cork> codecutter: you can't you would have to use something like ajax long pull or rocket
[05:42:06] <Cork> well... or alternatively websocekt if you have a server that support old enough versions of it
[05:42:29] <Cork> depending on what versions of ie you need support for
[05:44:24] <codecutter> no polyfil?
[05:44:49] <Cork> not that i know of
[05:45:02] <Cork> sse is basically just ajax long pulls though
[07:14:28] <FightingFalcon> https://www.abnehmenclub.de/kefirin-faydalari-nelerdir-kefir-nedir
[07:14:52] <FightingFalcon> why do i get wpdiscuzAjaxObj is not defined error in this page?
[07:30:55] <Cork> FightingFalcon: where is the code using the object?
[07:31:31] <FightingFalcon> Cork, i load the code after page is loaded (3 seconds after)
[07:31:49] <Cork> FightingFalcon: so you run it in the browser console?
[07:32:20] <FightingFalcon> Cork, no, it runs in the website
[07:58:19] <FightingFalcon> How do i define ajax object?
[08:08:51] <undefined_bob> FightingFalcon: you mean an XMLHttpRequest object?
[08:09:25] <Cork> he means the configuration object he puts for something in his site, but doesn't want to say what
[08:09:29] <FightingFalcon> https://www.abnehmenclub.de/kefirin-faydalari-nelerdir-kefir-nedir
[08:09:36] <undefined_bob> if not, maybe this overview can help you https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:09:37] <FightingFalcon> no please go to this site and you will see the error in the console
[08:10:47] <undefined_bob> Cork: ah I see, thats a bit difficult then
[08:10:59] <Cork> ya, there is nothing to work with
[08:11:20] <Cork> all the js in minified too so... yay
[08:11:38] <Cork> (and no maps)
[08:12:01] <undefined_bob> FightingFalcon: we can help you much better if you give us all information and/or create an example/test case on jsfiddle.net for example
[08:12:31] <FightingFalcon> Just tell me how to define wpdiscuzAjaxObj
[08:12:40] <undefined_bob> no one likes to debug minified code :D
[08:12:54] <Cork> FightingFalcon: we can't as we don't know what needs it
[08:13:04] <FightingFalcon> probably ajax url
[08:13:20] <Cork> looks like a plugin, but donno
[08:15:48] <undefined_bob> btw are you okay, Cork?
[08:15:56] <Cork> sure
[08:16:10] <undefined_bob> nice :)
[08:16:47] <Cork> its slow now in sommer time though, so not much to do
[08:20:23] <FightingFalcon> Im depressed
[08:20:48] <undefined_bob> yeah same here, not much to do, mostly idling the whole day
[08:21:21] <undefined_bob> a bit this and that but nothing serious
[08:21:27] <FightingFalcon> My depression is related to "wpdiscuzAjaxObj is not defined" error though
[08:21:37] <undefined_bob> FightingFalcon: but do you understand why we cant really help you?
[08:22:00] <FightingFalcon> Look i need to call jsquery file and define the ajaxobj
[08:22:31] <undefined_bob> yes but all your code there is minified we cant read it
[08:22:39] <FightingFalcon> ahhhhhhhh
[08:22:44] <FightingFalcon> let me provide a clean code then?
[08:22:56] <undefined_bob> would be a first step
[08:24:41] <FightingFalcon> https://pastebin.pl/view/bdb3e541
[08:24:44] <FightingFalcon> ok here you go
[08:26:20] <Cork> that isn't the related code
[08:27:20] <FightingFalcon> Cork, this code calls jquery.js
[08:27:27] <FightingFalcon> In which part does it call jquery?
[08:27:53] <Cork> well you need the code referencing the object you have problem with
[08:32:43] <FightingFalcon> btw whats a no quill file?
[08:35:02] <undefined_bob> Quill is a free, open source WYSIWYG editor
[08:35:11] <undefined_bob> if you mean that
[08:36:19] <FightingFalcon> look
[08:37:05] <FightingFalcon> Why does the plugin sometimes load wpdiscuz-combo.min.js and sometimes load wpdiscuz-combo.min.no.quill.js
[08:37:05] <FightingFalcon> ?
[08:37:35] <Cork> FightingFalcon: do you know how your site is set up?
[08:37:39] <FightingFalcon> no
[08:37:54] <Cork> then you should prob talk to the one that sat it up
[08:38:14] <Cork> you have a very much bigger chance of getting answers to these questions there
[08:38:28] <Cork> cause these are site specific questions, basically all of them
[08:39:01] <Cork> and without disecting and documenting the code of the site we can't answer those questions
[08:48:25] <FightingFalcon>                 wp_localize_script("wpdiscuz-combo-js", "wpdiscuzAjaxObj", $this->wpdiscuzOptionsJs);
[08:48:34] <FightingFalcon> im getting closer to the answer :D
[10:48:43] <jak2000> hi all is possible align at the right the text on a button?
[13:09:03] <codecutter> i have the following function inside my requireMain.js file. When I run the script with IE it throws an undefined error on line 8 (no complains in other browsers)
[13:09:09] <codecutter> https://pastebin.com/ngcQpxry
[13:09:19] <codecutter> do remove the '()'?
[13:09:32] <codecutter> do i*
[13:11:12] <robertmaxrees> codecutter you want ##javascript
[13:15:19] <makr8100> codecutter: In most use cases you can just choose to not support IE8.  In the event you do need to, I would bet that debug and/or compose are not supported.  If the error happens on optional code you may just use a browser detect to skip over it.
[13:15:50] <makr8100> If it's just legacy IE you need to skip use this: if (!document.all) { code IE is to ignore }
[13:16:01] <robertmaxrees> ##javascript is a much more relevant place for this convo fwiw :)
[13:16:06] <robertmaxrees> might head over there.
[13:16:51] <codecutter> It's IE 11
[13:17:28] <makr8100> I'm not in there and have enough channels on my list already lol, that was all I had anyways aside from the fact that if there's JQuery involved only JQ 1.x supports IE8
[13:17:51] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: 'kay.  moving on then :)
[13:18:34] <makr8100> Oh, LINE 8...  I can't read apparently...  Yeah still skip it with browser detect if you can, end discussion lol
[13:19:13] <robertmaxrees> cool - yeah.  if there's more to be said, head over to ##javascript.  not really a jquery question.  thanks!
[13:22:42] <codecutter> do people still use IE?
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> depends on your site :)
[13:22:59] <codecutter> I would love to remove support for it all together if I could
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> go check your analytics and see for yourself.
[13:23:21] <codecutter> generally
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:23:42] <robertmaxrees> if you DO need to support it, try something like webpack with a cross-compilation tool so you can worry less about supporting them.
[13:23:45] <codecutter> generally speaking how popular is IE
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not really a useful question
[13:23:56] <codecutter> hmm
[13:24:02] <robertmaxrees> it changes on region, industry, etc.
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> we still support IE11 because we have enough paying customers to justify it.
[13:24:24] <robertmaxrees> but we also use tools that make it much, much easier.
[13:25:57] <codecutter> less than 5% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers
[13:26:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not helpful information for your case fwiw :)
[13:26:30] <robertmaxrees> "the internet at large" and "your end users" are different.
[13:27:08] <codecutter> what would you do? I have an android and ios app and i have website works with all browsers except ie
[13:27:26] <robertmaxrees> have you... checked your analytics yet?
[13:27:28] <Robdgreat> you mean after checking yo
[13:27:29] <Robdgreat> ^^
[13:27:45] <codecutter> no i don't have it
[13:27:47] <robertmaxrees> that's step one: validate if it's worth supporting IE.
[13:27:56] <robertmaxrees> then there's your first problem.
[13:28:14] <robertmaxrees> solve that first - get analytics on your site.  let it run for a month or three, and then go from there.
[13:28:34] <Robdgreat> if you don't have any data, you might as well just be flipping a coin
[13:28:35] <codecutter> and leave off support for IE in the mean time?
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> i would, at the very least, get a simple webpack build process that transpiles down to ES5-friendly code for now.
[13:29:15] <robertmaxrees> doesn't need to be great, just functional.
[13:29:41] <Robdgreat> and/or indicate on the site that it's best viewed using [whatever]
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ this. though many end users don't have a choice, as we've learned at my company :)
[13:30:29] <Robdgreat> and/or provide a simple means of feedback in the event someone can't use a different browser
[13:30:48] <Robdgreat> but analytics are a must
[13:30:59] <Robdgreat> you need to put that in 3 months ago
[13:31:16] <codecutter> how do these work?
[13:31:17] <robertmaxrees> ^ up front.  one of the first things your app always needs?  analytics/.
[13:31:36] <Robdgreat> they track, among other things, the browser the user is using
[13:31:41] <Robdgreat> a lot of other things
[13:31:47] <codecutter> name?
[13:31:52] <codecutter> google analytics?
[13:31:59] <robertmaxrees> that's a popular (and free) option.
[13:33:52] <codecutter> google is always the best choice when it comes to dev tools :)
[13:34:24] <robertmaxrees> eh, not always.
[13:34:54] <codecutter> example?
[13:36:03] <robertmaxrees> vs code, typescript, webpack, react...
[13:36:13] <codecutter> what?
[13:36:24] <codecutter> I disagree
[13:36:25] <codecutter> :)
[13:36:34] <codecutter> check out flutter
[13:36:58] <codecutter> flutter mobile and web
[13:37:04] <codecutter> just try it once
[13:37:12] <codecutter> you'll like it
[13:37:52] <codecutter> way more superior than all those you list
[13:37:54] <codecutter> :)
[13:40:14] <Robdgreat> I smell bias
[13:40:37] <Robdgreat> because the things he listed don't even all do the same thing
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:35:44] <makr8100> firefox dev tools > chrome dev tools, fight me
[14:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you're not wrong ;)
[14:35:59] <robertmaxrees> too bad homeslace left.
[14:36:02] <robertmaxrees> *homeslice
[15:28:17] <JohnTalent> Anyone here use fancytree?
[15:28:47] <robertmaxrees> could always ask whatever question you've got and we can try to help JohnTalent :)
[15:34:27] <JohnTalent> Okay, how do I propogate json into a fancytree's tree via AJAX? The closest I partially see is .addChildren().
[15:35:26] <robertmaxrees> looks like it's got its own way to handle that for you.
[15:36:12] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/mar10/fancytree/wiki#define-the-tree-data - source: { url: '/foo
[15:36:41] <robertmaxrees> just gotta follow the format it specifics JohnTalent
[15:38:14] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: that's not ajax. that's a static server json file.
[15:38:30] <robertmaxrees> "Use the source option to load the data via Ajax."
[15:38:45] <robertmaxrees> i think you may have missed a step - care to clarify what you're trying to accomplish?
[15:39:26] <robertmaxrees> because ajax is how you usually load data onto a page that isn't present on pageload.
[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> regardless of how that data is stored server-side.
[15:41:32] <JohnTalent> I have json already loading using the method you profess.
[15:41:53] <robertmaxrees> ok.  so what's the issue?
[15:42:07] <JohnTalent> I want to fetch json from a django server and populate it dynamically into a fancytree.
[15:42:25] <robertmaxrees> why not re-render the tree in that case?
[15:42:28] <robertmaxrees> replace what's there.
[15:42:39] <JohnTalent> yes. why not.
[15:42:42] <robertmaxrees> just pass different options for that source:
[15:42:50] <robertmaxrees> to get the server-side data you're looking for.
[15:44:18] <JohnTalent> I'm looking at https://www.jqueryscript.net/layout/jQuery-jQuery-UI-Dynamic-Tree-View-Plugin-Fancytree.html
[15:44:47] <robertmaxrees> yeah - that's the same one that I linked to the docs for.
[15:44:52] <robertmaxrees> so that's the issuee?
[15:45:11] <robertmaxrees> are you asking how to re-render the tree?  or to change the source to get the data you want?
[15:47:57] <JohnTalent> yes exactly.
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> those are two different questions.
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the code you have right now in a fiddle?  it's fine if it doesn't function.
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> might help me understand where you're getting stuf.
[15:49:17] <JohnTalent> both questions then.
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> sure - show code and we'll go from there :)
[15:50:58] <JohnTalent> i'll be back in a few. gonna eat.
[15:51:05] <robertmaxrees> k...
[16:19:56] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: https://pastebin.com/t4QW3qRA
[16:21:12] <robertmaxrees> so why not replace the contents of that click handler with a $('#tree').html()
[16:21:25] <robertmaxrees> $('#tree').html(''), and then re-run .fancyTree?
[16:24:57] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: what is wrong about using json? because that's what my server WILL generate.
[16:25:12] <robertmaxrees> there did I say anything about json???
[16:25:17] <robertmaxrees> you need json for the tree.
[16:27:59] <robertmaxrees> JohnTalent ^
[16:29:37] <JohnTalent> how do you rerun fancytree?
[16:29:56] <robertmaxrees> $("#tree").fancytree({ /* your config here */ });
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> just like you are now.
[16:30:06] <JohnTalent> ok
[16:32:42] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/28915134/923919 even better, there's a .reload() method: tree.reload(newSourceOption); :)
[16:32:53] <robertmaxrees> so you can skip destroying the entire thing.
[19:24:56] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: If I generate json at the python server via json.dumps in-memory I return it as pure ajax json in the response.
[19:26:54] <robertmaxrees> there is no just thing a "pure ajax json", so I'm not really sure what you're trying to say :)
[19:26:59] <robertmaxrees> *no such thing
[19:28:15] <robertmaxrees> JohnTalent
[19:32:02] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: Okay I should say 'only' json instead of pure.
[19:32:16] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question/issue?
[19:32:20] <JohnTalent> That stackflow you posted is very nice.
[19:32:41] <JohnTalent> robertmaxrees: Is there any error in my 19:25 response?
[19:32:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:32:59] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean your question about generating JSON?
[19:33:19] <JohnTalent> yes
[19:33:22] <robertmaxrees> (different time zones my dude :) )
[19:33:27] <JohnTalent> ah sorry.
[19:33:41] <robertmaxrees> yes - there's no such thing as "ajax json"
[19:33:48] <JohnTalent> understood.
[19:33:50] <robertmaxrees> you can retrieve json using ajax.
[19:33:58] <robertmaxrees> ajax is just another http request.
[19:34:23] <JohnTalent> .reload() + type: 'GET', etc, is the key.
[19:34:40] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[19:34:53] <robertmaxrees> though 'GET' may be implied by the library.
[19:35:40] <JohnTalent> okay, i think I am clear now robertmaxrees. Thank you for your help.
[19:35:49] <robertmaxrees> definitely!  what we're here for :)
[23:21:26] <robertparkerx> my response is none from ajax but if(response != 'none') { doesn't work
[23:21:58] <robertparkerx> well it does for the other
[23:22:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[23:22:15] <robertmaxrees> (show code in a fiddle pls, along with the data coming back)
[23:24:38] <robertparkerx> my selector was the problem
[23:24:40] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry
[23:24:45] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[23:24:49] <robertmaxrees> alright.
