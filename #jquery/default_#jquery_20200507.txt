[09:34:11] <shangul> Repost: Why it does not work as expected?(The focused element should move up with ArrowUp) and why does index() always return -1?
[09:34:15] <shangul> https://jsfiddle.net/3cwLt6gv/
[09:45:36] <dw1> because look at https://api.jquery.com/index/
[09:45:43] <dw1> you dont do div.index
[09:45:45] <dw1> you do article.index
[09:46:28] <dw1> still doesnt work tho
[09:48:00] <dw1> var curr_elm  = $("article").index($('article:focus'));
[09:48:01] <dw1> like that
[09:49:59] <dw1> or var curr_elm  = $("div article").index($(":focus"));
[09:51:16] <dw1> but it's easy to lose focus by clicking something else on the page
[09:51:18] <dw1> so prob a bad way to do it
[09:51:24] <dw1> prob better to use a global variable storing the position
[09:51:57] <dw1> unless you want it like that
[09:55:29] <dw1> the docs say "If we use a string as the .index() method's argument, it is interpreted as a jQuery selector string. The first element among the object's matched elements which also matches this selector is located."
[09:55:33] <dw1> but that doesnt seem to be the case
[09:55:40] <dw1> seems to need $(":focus")
[09:55:42] <dw1> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:00:32] <dw1> this guy was similarly confused https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27050363/how-to-use-jquery-index-method
[10:00:56] <dw1> "this looks like a bug in the docs , or in the code"
[10:06:11] <dw1> ok this works: var curr_elm  = $(":focus").index("div article");
[10:06:17] <dw1> :S
[10:06:39] <dw1> so docs wrong again
[10:06:53] <dw1> stupid function
[12:58:40] <shangul> dw1, Thank you! I didn't know it works like that...
[13:00:41] <shangul> dw1, And I am developing for KaiOS. No cursor there if there is no need to it.
[13:49:33] <znf> does anyone have any idea how to actually make jquery datatables ignore 2 columns in my table? ie: I have a 5 column table, but I only get 2 columns from my backend, the other 3 needs to be generated client side
[14:27:38] <Jase> shangul, did you get your issue fixed with .index()?
[15:28:56] <destramic> why am i getting an error with const declared in my class please? https://pastebin.com/AiqerUzj
