[03:04:43] <fas3r> can I monitor an XHR request using AJAX, like a "keep alive" to provide info from the backend ?
[06:15:56] <RM982> var output = document.getElementById('foo'); output.addClass('some_class');
[06:16:02] <RM982> output.addClass is not a function   why?
[06:27:52] <Woet> RM982: because you're not using jQuery to select the element.
[06:28:14] <Woet> RM982: wrap it in $() or just use jQuery to select it in the first place
[06:30:52] <RM982> ahh thanks thought it would work with vanilla js anyway
[09:26:47] <jsjolen> If I've got some parent p and some child c (both are DOM objects wrapped with $()) then how do I remove c from p? p.remove(c) throws errors because c isn't a string
[09:28:14] <jsjolen> Aha, c.remove()?
[13:11:31] <cannap> hi
