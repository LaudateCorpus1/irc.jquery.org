[00:06:41] <cadz> Cork: are you there
[00:06:50] <Cork> sure
[00:08:51] <cadz> Cork: my jquery version is 1.4.2, when i used the fileupload plugin, it doesnt detect that function, i think because of my old version, so i downloaded 1.6 which is the minimum requirement of the plugin, and used jQuery.noConflict, it doesnt have any errors anymore. But is it safe to assume that i can fully use now the plugin, cause it is still not working, i followed the basic plugin in the ducu, i dont know if im doing it wrong or the version just dont work.
[00:09:42] <Cork> cadz: what isn't working?
[00:10:41] <cadz> Cork: it is suppose to display the files i have selected, multiple files, but it isnt, and i am not getting any errors, in the console. firebug. I even console.logged the 'data', the one i am asking you a minute ago.
[00:11:16] <Cork> cadz: don't know enough about the plugin to say what might go wrong
[00:11:46] <cadz> Cork: when i use the jQuery.noConflict, can i use that plugin?
[00:11:58] <Cork> cadz: yes
[00:12:11] <Cork> well at least if the plugin is written correctly
[00:12:32] <cadz> Cork: okay, so my code is wrong. thank a lot sir.
[00:12:34] <Cork> cadz: not though, you should never use more then one jquery version at the same time
[00:12:40] <Cork> *note
[00:12:50] <cadz> Cork: yeah, i understand.
[00:13:02] <Cork> noConflict is to help working with other frameworks
[00:13:39] <Cork> cadz: also if it failed cause of something like code inclusion you would get an error in the browser console
[00:14:07] <cadz> Cork: wew, so it is partially working, just not the way i expected. :)
[00:18:01] <cadz> Cork: can you check this out sir? http://jsfiddle.net/HCrWN/
[00:20:26] <Cork> cadz: no the code isn't working
[00:21:01] <Cork> the libs needs to be loaded from the external resources accordion on the left (except for jquery you set it at the top there)
[00:21:13] <cadz> Cork: yes, it shouldnt work in the jsfiddle because it needs the plugin, i just thought maybe you can point out what im doing wrong
[00:22:03] <Cork> cadz: wekk your code doesn't parse
[00:22:15] <Cork> you have removed the done callback
[00:22:21] <Cork> so data is undefined
[00:22:28] <Cork> same with data.*
[00:22:34] <cadz> oh wait i must have forgot
[00:23:25] <cadz> Cork: it is now updated, http://jsfiddle.net/HCrWN/1/
[00:24:08] <slax0r> will window.open open a new tab if browser permits it, or will it always be a fresh new window?
[00:24:38] <cadz> slax0r: yes
[00:24:39] <Cork> cadz: i really can't say anything more then "this parses" http://jsfiddle.net/HCrWN/2/
[00:24:47] <slax0r> k tnx
[00:24:53] <Cork> slacko: depends on the browser settings
[00:25:32] <Cork> and some triggers in the browser
[00:25:55] <Cork> there is some options that will always trigger popups
[00:26:04] <Cork> but i don't remember what options it was
[00:26:07] <slax0r> Cork: I understand that, I just need to open a link in a new tab or window, but prefer the new tab, it's less anoying I think
[00:26:19] <Cork> ya
[00:26:30] <slax0r> and if I can do it with one function, then that's good enough for me
[00:26:40] <Cork> slax0r: i think it is if you set width/height that it will always be a popup
[00:26:42] <Cork> or something like that
[00:27:11] <slax0r> hm, come to think of it, can there be cross-domain issues with that?
[00:27:16] <Cork> i rarely use window.open anymore so i've forgotten most of it :)
[00:27:27] <Cork> slax0r: no
[00:27:39] <Cork> window.open is meant to be cross domain safe
[00:27:58] <slax0r> well, I'm developing the gplus login, and I wouldn't want to redirect the user away from our site, I'd rather if it opens in a new tab/window the way fb is doing it already
[00:28:01] <Cork> window.parent and handler = window.open doesn't work if it is cross domain
[00:28:04] <Cork> but that is all
[00:28:23] <Cork> slax0r: that should really be up to the user
[00:28:30] <slax0r> well google then redirects back to your provided url, window.parent should work after that, right?
[00:28:39] <Cork> ctrl+click is there for a reason
[00:28:56] <slax0r> you'd be surprised how many people don't know that shortcut, or middle mouse btn
[00:29:15] <Cork> slax0r: it is quite common knowledge
[00:29:29] <Cork> and for the rest there is the back button (that you break with window.open)
[00:29:34] <slax0r> just blasting out ideas for this, what if I use an iframe for this?
[00:29:46] <Cork> possible
[00:29:50] <Cork> depends on the use case
[00:30:09] <Cork> some sites forbid wrapping them in iframes
[00:30:19] <slax0r> this can be detected?
[00:30:41] <Cork> new http headers can even forbid it
[00:31:01] <slax0r> hrm, not a safe option then :/
[00:31:02] <Cork> "don't show this page if it is in an iframe"
[00:31:34] <Cork> slax0r: the reason i'm quite hostile to sites forcing new tabs/windows when you leave the site
[00:31:36] <slax0r> I'm pretty sure it would work, but I don't want a angry client calling me at 2am on a saturday that gplus login stopped working
[00:31:48] <Cork> is cause often that happens at a different time then when the user wants it
[00:32:07] <Cork> ex. you have a listing > spec site > link to other site *new tab*
[00:32:07] <slax0r> redirect sounds like the safest option
[00:32:16] <Cork> where the user would want the new tab after the listing
[00:32:22] <Cork> not after the spec for a specific item
[00:32:31] <Cork> so instead of back > back
[00:32:44] <Cork> they need close > move mouse > back
[00:32:59] <Cork> meaning the new tab is totally useless to the user
[00:34:29] <slax0r> but in this particular case, the tab/window would close automatically after the login process is finished
[00:34:43] <Cork> slax0r: also for novice users a new fullscreen window, means the back button is grayed out
[00:34:51] <Cork> so they type in the old url again
[00:34:59] <Cork> totally missing the site existed
[00:35:04] <slax0r> true
[00:35:05] <Cork> (tabs is often the same thing)
[00:35:19] <Cork> my mom for example misses if a site opens a new tab
[00:35:28] <Cork> and just stares at the grayed out back button
[00:35:43] <Cork> and then goes to the site through the urlbar again
[00:35:51] <slax0r> I think I need to re-factor my app to use a normal redirect, but this could cause the same efect as you're explaining right now
[00:36:04] <Cork> meaning forcing the new tab was totally contra productive
[00:36:07] <slax0r> except the back would not be grayed
[00:36:20] <Cork> cause if they don't remember the site url, they google for it and might go to another site
[00:36:48] <Cork> slax0r: using the back button is web browsing 101
[00:37:02] <Cork> can't say i've seen anyone not knowing what it does
[00:37:13] <Cork> (that at all know how to surf the web)
[00:38:00] <Cork> slax0r: the only situation i see an exception to that rule
[00:38:13] <Cork> is for pages that is js heavy hand hold a lot of data in js
[00:38:20] <Cork> so if they get unloaded data are lost
[00:38:27] <Cork> but that is basically the only case
[00:38:55] <Cork> (though this is to large parts just my opinion, many have different opinions)
[00:38:56] <slax0r> I've decided, even though I don't particulary like your answer, because it means much more work, but I'll stop arguing and just trust you, I believe it's safe to say you have more experience in this area than me ;)
[00:39:02] <slax0r> thanks for the help :)
[00:39:15] <Cork> np
[00:39:32] <Cork> slax0r: and what i said here isn't rules, it is just arguments for why i don't like those things
[00:39:48] <slax0r> it makes sense
[00:40:11] <Cork> to the point where i have extensions in the browser that kills target="" and window.open
[00:40:19] <Cork> (open just does window.location ="")
[00:40:53] <Cork> window.open = function(url) { window.location = url; } :)
[00:41:28] <Cork> (with a check for ctrl to leave the new tab feature still working)
[00:42:14] <slax0r> oh god, another idea, load the google login with ajax and display it in a container :P
[00:43:08] <Dreagos> $(PagePanelAdd).data('item', pageVariableString[i]).appendTo('#PagePanel' + pdfPageTrack).draggable({
[00:43:08] <Dreagos>                                  stack: 'PagePanel' + pdfPageTrack, cursor: 'move', revert: 'true' });
[00:43:13] <Dreagos> is there anything I need to add to that to allow it to roam freely?
[00:44:44] <hellothere> hey there any ideas how to make this dynamicaly work with bootstrap? atm its not even pulling the data http://fiddle.jshell.net/dLTRZ/1/

[00:56:23] <hellothere> ?
[00:56:29] <Cork> ?ask
[00:56:29] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[00:57:46] <hellothere> any ideas how to make this dynamicaly work with bootstrap? atm its not even pulling the data http://fiddle.jshell.net/dLTRZ/1/  at the moment it doesnt seem able to display the data at all, on fiddler the request is successful and the data are there
[01:09:35] <Dreagos> and then wait for an hour or two for your question to maybe be answered :p
[01:09:46] <Dreagos> yay working til 2am
[01:14:39] <Cork> Dreagos: doesn't really matter when you work
[01:14:50] <Cork> it is all about if someone in here happens to know the answer
[01:14:57] <Dreagos> yeah
[01:15:22] <Dreagos> I dunno how many people here use the drag/drop jquery stuff
[01:15:31] <Dreagos> can't be too many though
[01:15:47] <luvmyh0nda> back: [reason: Idle after 1h]±[gone: 28m34s]±[ç§]
[01:15:47] <luvmyh0nda> i do some
[01:15:59] <Cork> luvmyh0nda: please kill that announcer
[01:16:04] <Dreagos> how do I get the drag items out of a scrollable div?
[01:17:23] <hellothere> back: [reason: Idle after 1h]ï¿½[gone: 28m34s]ï¿½[ï¿½ï¿½]
[01:17:27] <Cork> <_<
[01:17:33] <Cork> hellothere: you too
[01:17:44] <Cork> there is no reason to spam the channel with that
[01:17:58] <hellothere> i like that addon ill start using it
[01:18:12] <luvmyh0nda> Dreagos: so you have <div id='div1'><div id='div2'></div></div>
[01:18:23] <Cork> hellothere: it is really bad practice to use them
[01:18:26] <luvmyh0nda> trying to drag 2 outside of the display of 1?
[01:18:45] <Cork> and most channels will ask you to turn if off (and many will bad you if you don't)
[01:18:56] <hellothere> why? thats why irc was made for, using addons for spam wars
[01:19:05] <Cork> hellothere: not at all
[01:19:05] <Dreagos> I have <Div1></div><div2></div>
[01:19:16] <xKraty> back: [reason: Idle after 1h]ï¿½[gone: 28m34s]ï¿½[ï¿½ï¿½]
[01:19:17] <Dreagos> and want to drag from div 1 to div 2
[01:19:23] <hellothere> its like giving a lightsaber to a kid
[01:19:23] <xKraty> lol kidding Cork :p

[01:19:55] <Dreagos> yes
[01:20:00] <luvmyh0nda> yeah, i got you bro
[01:20:04] <Dreagos> :D
[01:20:05] <luvmyh0nda> are you changing the ID's or anything?
[01:20:09] <hellothere> away: [reason: away]ï¿½[gone: 0m0s]ï¿½[ï¿½ï¿½]
[01:20:12] <Dreagos> no
[01:20:20] <luvmyh0nda> getting the input, i assume?
[01:20:24] <Dreagos> I'm setting labels with the value
[01:20:26] <Dreagos> yeah
[01:20:42] <luvmyh0nda> ok, cool. i have some scripts that accomplish this, let me dig them out & make a fiddle
[01:20:56] <luvmyh0nda> Cork: auto-away set to 360000 minutes
[01:21:00] <luvmyh0nda> kplzthx
[01:21:09] <Cork> heh

[01:22:19] <Cork> sigh so a troll...
[01:22:24] <Cork> ok troll along
[01:22:30] * Cork sets ignore on hellothere
[01:22:31] <xKraty> lmao
[01:22:46] * xKraty gives Cork a huge a hammer
[01:22:49] <luvmyh0nda> away[reason: Not actually set to 36000 minutes]ï¿½[gone: 03m29s]ï¿½[ï¿½ï¿½]
[01:23:08] <luvmyh0nda> had to do it
[01:23:33] <hellothere> :D come on Cork i was just kidding bro
[01:23:34] <hellothere> peace
[01:24:55] <luvmyh0nda> Dreagos: bear with me, i found the script, making a fiddle
[01:24:55] <xKraty> he's coming to stab you hellothere lol
[01:25:11] <Dreagos> no worries
[01:25:15] <Dreagos> I can be patient :)
[01:25:32] <hellothere> :( i love Cork he is my babe
[01:25:37] <Dreagos> I've been working on this for 17 hours straight about now, what's a few more minutes?
[01:25:55] <Dreagos> yay deadlines \o/
[01:26:37] <xKraty> i like deadlines, you are never ready for!
[01:26:54] <widoz> :D
[01:27:11] <hellothere> Dreagos: if you got a deadline and you cant achieve your thing, then it means ur just unable to work
[01:27:24] <hellothere> what did i just say ? i can't even read what i said
[01:27:52] <xKraty> hellothere: depend how deadline was set
[01:27:54] <Dreagos> our client has a show lined up for the 15th, and they are demanding a beta version be ready for tomorrow
[01:28:07] <xKraty> my deadline are always wrong, they didn't give me enough time for
[01:28:29] <xKraty> hey Dreagos tell em to fck we have to party for my birthday that day! lol
[01:28:56] <hellothere> well so Dreagos you creating a website in js html and css?
[01:29:15] <Dreagos> and C#/asp.net
[01:29:39] <luvmyh0nda> dumroll please?
[01:29:44] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/TkMrg/2/
[01:29:44] <xKraty> asp :\
[01:29:44] <Dreagos> and a myriad of other technologies that don't really like to play well together
[01:29:58] <hellothere> thats the problem just there Dreagos :D
[01:30:02] <luvmyh0nda> shit 1 sec
[01:30:03] * xKraty dmuroll
[01:30:15] <hellothere> i wouldn't use asp just for a simple site
[01:30:16] * xKraty dadabumtiss
[01:30:47] <luvmyh0nda> LOL
[01:31:13] <hellothere> the complexity of asp on creating simple things is just ...
[01:31:28] <hellothere> controllers and models and constructors
[01:31:42] <Dreagos> ummm
[01:31:48] <Dreagos> that didn't work right
[01:32:12] <luvmyh0nda> yeah
[01:32:16] <luvmyh0nda> the first one works
[01:32:23] <luvmyh0nda> hold on, i'm looking @ how i fixed that slight issue
[01:33:04] <Dreagos> item 4 decided to jump over everything and land itself in the text, item 3 disappeared, and item 1 and 2 decided to stick within the the scrolling div
[01:33:22] <Dreagos> :p
[01:34:41] <Dreagos> hmmm
[01:34:54] <Dreagos> can I remove the scrolling while dragging?
[01:36:14] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/TkMrg/12/
[01:36:14] <Dreagos> set the attribute of the div to overflow:hidden; upon taking the item onto the mouse
[01:36:23] <luvmyh0nda> it works well if you're cloning
[01:36:24] <xKraty> oh gosh drag and drop
[01:36:39] <xKraty> if you set overflow hidden it will never get off there
[01:37:02] <luvmyh0nda> once you clone, you can remove the ID of the object on the other side
[01:37:44] <luvmyh0nda> actually i have 2 helpers on that one =\
[01:38:35] <Dreagos> hmmm
[01:39:14] <Dreagos> how long will that stay up?
[01:39:25] <luvmyh0nda> the fiddle?
[01:39:36] <Dreagos> yeah
[01:39:40] <luvmyh0nda> not sure
[01:40:19] <luvmyh0nda> it's weird that first one works
[01:40:21] <luvmyh0nda> and then it craps out
[01:41:21] <Dreagos> will that work with .draggable and droppable too?
[01:41:27] <Dreagos> or does it need sortable?
[01:42:25] <luvmyh0nda> you could probably just use droppable
[01:42:31] <luvmyh0nda> i'm looking at one other thing right now
[01:43:58] <Dreagos> ok, I am going to finish this later, I need sleep
[01:44:19] <xKraty> Dreagos: you should use longer
[01:44:22] <xKraty> list w/o scroll
[01:45:54] <Dreagos> I have 120 drop items
[01:46:11] <Dreagos> and an indeterminate number of drag items
[01:46:29] <luvmyh0nda> use a series of checkboxes
[01:46:33] <luvmyh0nda> :o
[01:46:41] <luvmyh0nda> notrly
[01:47:03] <xKraty> didn't follow from begin, you already tried to set overflow auto on dragstart?
[01:47:03] <luvmyh0nda> the drag & drop takes some work to get it working right, but totally worth it
[01:47:42] <luvmyh0nda> overflow:visible and scroll false somewhat worked
[01:47:59] <xKraty> meh i got an idea
[01:48:11] <xKraty> you could hide all other elements on dragstart
[01:48:14] <xKraty> and overflow auto
[01:48:47] <luvmyh0nda> you could write a function... that starts a timer... to run 3 of itself
[01:50:12] <xKraty> question, how you handle undefined things? typeof something !== undefined ?
[01:50:27] <xKraty> or something !== undefined
[01:50:32] <luvmyh0nda> if (this != undefined) { do this }
[01:50:32] <xKraty> or something != 'undefined'
[01:50:40] <xKraty> really hate undefined :|
[01:50:45] <luvmyh0nda> also https://scontent-a-pao.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/t1/376332_3443550490745_50083249_n.jpg
[01:50:54] <luvmyh0nda> normally works as well
[01:51:39] <xKraty> i try to set things to false for avoid the undefined issues
[01:52:03] <xKraty> yay!
[01:52:18] <luvmyh0nda> gus?
[01:53:36] <fosser_josh> hi guys, i want to send volume increase request using $.post(). var vol = 10, $.post('/volume/$vol', { "count": 10}, function(data) {   }); $vol is var vol. This is just example, what i want to do. I am not using this code. Just wanted to know how to send volume information over url loclahost/volume/{vol}?
[01:54:45] <luvmyh0nda> are you using something like mod_rewrite?
[01:55:46] <xKraty> { "count": 10, vol: $vol }
[01:57:00] <bigbugjava> " Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'prefixed' " - Elastislide error, searched google with no sucess for that error
[01:57:18] <fosser_josh> xKraty: var vol = 10, $.post('/volume/'+ $vol); is this right?
[01:57:35] <xKraty> yeah but that one is passed by get not post
[01:57:37] <luvmyh0nda> http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/5/
[01:57:41] <xKraty> instead use $.ajax then
[01:57:45] <luvmyh0nda> OR
[01:58:11] <luvmyh0nda> actually first one missed an apos: http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/6/
[01:58:31] <luvmyh0nda> this one uses your URL method: http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/7/
[01:58:38] <fosser_josh> xKraty: even though i use post?
[01:58:54] <luvmyh0nda> fosser_josh: type: 'post' in your ajax call
[01:59:29] <fosser_josh> k
[01:59:33] <xKraty> eg in php if you pass it on url yo wont have it on $_POST
[01:59:34] <luvmyh0nda> oh no jquery
[01:59:46] <luvmyh0nda> this method uses the URL: http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/9/
[02:00:06] <luvmyh0nda> this method uses POST for both: http://jsfiddle.net/MAR7M/10/
[02:00:19] <xKraty> luvmyh0nda: solution are all rights, depends on your needs server side
[02:00:31] <luvmyh0nda> yep
[02:00:56] <luvmyh0nda> well, if you're using mod_rewrite you could you have it in the URL
[02:01:06] <luvmyh0nda> eg $_REQUEST
[02:01:23] <fosser_josh> luvmyh0nda: xKraty: thanks
[02:01:33] <luvmyh0nda> no prob
[02:01:55] <xKraty> np

[02:12:36] <Cork> krambiorix: i think you need to scroll window in chrome
[02:13:03] <Cork> b0bi: $(this).find('.somesclass')
[02:13:05] <Kira> e.g. I'm using a custom `source` function, but also want to fallback or do some fancy adjustments using the output of jquery-ui's internal autocomplete search.
[02:13:09] <krambiorix> Cork, i tried, $(window).animate({scrollTop: pos-50});  but doesn't do anything
[02:13:26] <Cork> krambiorix: one min i had to solve this a while back
[02:13:39] <a_fejer> is there a way to unbind a click event from an element in an inline manner?
[02:13:56] <b0bi> Cork: mucho gracias
[02:14:40] <Cork> krambiorix: hmm var $scrollWindow = ($scroll[0] === document ? $(document.documentElement) : $scroll);
[02:14:47] <Cork> so ya documentElement should work
[02:15:38] <krambiorix> Cork, i solved it
[02:15:52] <krambiorix> Cork, 		$("html, body").animate({scrollTop: pos-50});
[02:15:56] <krambiorix> works in chrome
[02:16:13] <krambiorix> and in FF
[02:16:20] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ck97t/
[02:16:24] <Cork> opps
[02:16:35] <Cork> was in scroll up >_>
[02:17:00] <Cork> krambiorix: that fiddle works in both chrome and firefox for me
[02:17:05] <krambiorix> Cork, not here
[02:17:11] <krambiorix> Cork, doesn't work in C
[02:17:19] <Cork> krambiorix: what version of chrome?
[02:17:37] <krambiorix> Cork, 30.0.1599.114 on Ubuntu
[02:19:16] <xKraty> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/Ck97t/1/
[02:20:12] <Cork> hmm weird
[02:20:36] <Cork> krambiorix: ya i can reproduce on chrome
[02:20:42] <Cork> but not chromium
[02:20:42] <krambiorix> xKraty, yes, that's what i'm using now :) And that works
[02:21:03] <Cork> seams like chrome has bugged something out
[02:21:32] <krambiorix> Cork, hooorray
[02:21:36] <Cork> luckely the code i showed before isn't in use anymore :)
[02:21:41] <krambiorix> :D
[02:21:51] <krambiorix> haha
[02:21:59] <xKraty> Cork: latest chrome versione are always worst :\
[02:22:07] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks for your help!
[02:22:11] <Cork> xkr47: 30 isn't latest though
[02:22:16] <Cork> *xKraty:
[02:22:20] <Cork> krambiorix: np
[02:22:29] <Cork> xKraty: chrome 30 and 33 is buggy
[02:22:34] <Cork> chromium 32 isn't :/
[02:22:46] <xKraty> they fortunally fixed something
[02:22:58] <Cork> what do you mean?
[02:23:08] <xKraty> one of latest version broke my markers mouseover over on gmap
[02:23:15] <Cork> ah
[02:23:20] <xKraty> overlay*
[02:23:30] <xKraty> i struggled myself for 2 hours
[02:23:39] <xKraty> rolled back the version to 3 weeks
[02:23:47] <Cork> my boss have problem at our login page
[02:23:50] <xKraty> and then i tried on firefox and was still workking
[02:23:53] <Cork> where the text doesn't render
[02:23:58] <Cork> but only in his profile >_<
[02:24:17] <Cork> (incognito or a new profile doesn't have the bug)
[02:24:27] <Cork> makes it a lovely task fixing it...
[02:24:51] <xKraty> lol
[02:24:58] <xKraty> change boss, /fixed
[02:25:06] <Cork> "hey, boss can i borrow your browser with all your account information"
[02:25:37] <xKraty> lol
[02:25:45] <Cork> na he knows what hes doing
[02:25:53] <Cork> so it isn't like he is on my tail for it
[02:26:06] <Cork> but it still makes a bug that is close to impossible to fix
[02:26:18] <xKraty> also my boss has the power to click and broke 10 hours of work and 10312312 tests
[02:26:36] <Cork> what?
[02:26:45] <Cork> click and break?
[02:26:56] <xKraty> break* yeah
[02:27:20] <xKraty> i cant type today, even worst than usual
[02:37:14] <hellothere> hey any ideas http://jsfiddle.net/gngWL/1/ how can i make that accordition to be recreated each time there is a new index ?
[02:38:32] <xKraty> you should ask cork but he ignored you lol
[02:38:45] <Cork> <_<
[02:38:48] <xKraty> erm blank page here
[02:39:00] <Cork> ah
[02:39:18] <hellothere> <: i was just being a bit annoying i know
[02:40:58] <xKraty> still your fiddle is not working for me
[02:41:34] <hellothere> http://fiddle.jshell.net/U6uK8/
[02:43:03] <xKraty> still :|
[02:44:17] <hellothere> well i cant connect it on the fiddle cause i got no data  <:
[02:44:43] <hellothere> i am just throwing it as an example of what i am trying to do
[02:47:00] <xKraty> oh and tell it <.<
[02:47:28] <xKraty> it should work like that
[02:48:24] <hellothere> it doesnt, for some reason i need to recreate the accordion for every items in the index
[02:49:04] <xKraty> you have to rebind it i guess
[02:49:42] <xKraty> $('#accordion').accordion('refrehs') or whatever you using
[02:49:47] <xKraty> refresh*
[02:50:02] <hellothere> aham thx for that kraty :)
[02:50:09] <hellothere> ill look into that right now
[02:52:58] <hellothere> .accordion is for the jquery one not for the bootstrap one :S
[02:55:29] <furyFoo> Hello everyone
[02:55:29] <furyFoo> I wrote this function and I'm not 100% sure it's correct.  http://pastebin.com/yVp5mWMs
[02:55:29] <furyFoo> Did I correctly sent the associative array or how do I have to write it ?
[02:55:29] <furyFoo> Also how do i call the array pockets in PHP , is it : $_POST["emailArray"]["SenderName"] or is there some other way i should be aware of ?
[02:56:10] <xKraty> hellothere: it was an example
[02:56:53] <hellothere> ye xKraty i get it, its just that bootstrap thing doesnt have a bind command :s
[02:57:54] <xKraty> furyFoo: you overwrite the same element each time
[02:58:16] <xKraty> no nvm furyFoo my bad i read it wrong
[02:58:30] <furyFoo> Thanks for the interest :)
[02:59:16] <xKraty> 1 sec
[03:01:41] <xKraty> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a579e4b9b91967f4aeb3 i would compact it like that
[03:03:02] <xKraty> hellothere: you sure markup is right?
[03:03:55] <xKraty> hellothere: you should try $('#collapse').collapse()
[03:04:25] <hellothere> ye i am trying with that but its weird to recreate it
[03:06:15] <Kingsy> has the live() function been depreciated in 1.9 ?
[03:07:02] <xKraty> i think it got removed on 1.9
[03:07:03] <xec> deprecated since 1.7, removed in 1.9
[03:07:21] <xKraty> version deprecated: 1.7, removed: 1.9
[03:07:30] <xKraty> damn xec again
[03:07:33] <xec> :D
[03:07:41] * xec high fives xKraty
[03:07:44] <hellothere> http://fiddle.jshell.net/U6uK8/1/ i now need something like a function that would assign the title and the collapse in the thing
[03:08:35] <xec> hellothere: can you make a running demo?  there is no accordian to look at to see what you're talking about
[03:09:17] * xKraty high fives xec
[03:09:20] <xec> accordion*?
[03:09:40] <xec> openandclosethingy
[03:11:08] <furyFoo> Thanks xKraty
[03:11:17] <xKraty> np
[03:13:16] <xec> furyFoo: that's an object, not an array btw
[03:13:30] <xec> there is no "associative array" in javascript
[03:14:16] <furyFoo> I know :( But I like to call them like that
[03:14:34] <furyFoo> Keeps a bit oh harmony between JS and PHP
[03:15:17] <furyFoo> BTW calling the object in PHP in this form : $_POST["emailArray"]["SenderName"]  . That's correct , right ?
[03:15:38] <furyFoo> I'm testing it soon , so just making sure :)
[03:15:42] <xec> i doubt it
[03:16:08] <xec> long time since i used php, but how would it know about the "emailArray" name, it only exists in js
[03:16:41] <xec> you can inspect the http post to see what gets sent, but I bet $_POST["SenderName"] would suffice
[03:17:34] <furyFoo> How do i do the inspection ?  Console log ... something ?
[03:17:51] <xec> furyFoo: no just look at the network tab after the code has ran
[03:18:17] <furyFoo> Thanks a lot for the info.
[03:18:22] <xec> $_POST["emailArray"]["SenderName"] would probably work if you did $.post(url, { emailArray: emailArray }, ...)
[03:18:31] <furyFoo> That should allow me to play with the sent data
[03:19:44] <QaDeS> hi. is anybody interested in a routine that allows for easier event debugging?
[03:20:05] <xKraty> furyFoo: you have directly SenderName in php
[03:20:13] <xKraty> $_POST['SenderName']
[03:20:35] <kas84> hi there
[03:20:37] <xKraty> oh didn't see xec told ya yet
[03:20:40] <xec> :D :D
[03:21:12] * xKraty high five again
[03:21:20] <kas84> I have a memory leak when using .empty() and append() over and over
[03:21:20] * xKraty jumping high five
[03:21:25] * xec high fives everyone
[03:21:30] <kas84> anybody run into this problem too?
[03:22:27] <xec> kas84: what browsers have you tested?
[03:22:38] <kas84> just on chrome for now
[03:22:38] <furyFoo> Thanks Kraty - will run a test now
[03:22:49] <kas84> chrome for mac
[03:28:52] <kas84> xec: any ideas?
[03:29:10] <xec> kas84: not really, .empty() is supposed to be safe
[03:29:24] <xec> i haven't had issues with it
[03:29:32] <kas84> aha
[03:30:00] <kas84> thanks anyway, I will try to isolate the problem
[03:33:40] <furyFoo> Test worked - thanks a ton fellows
[03:34:01] * furyFoo raises glass
[03:34:17] <furyFoo> Cheers
[03:35:47] <mikecmpbll> i'm writing a simple jquery plugin, how can i store some information against a specific jquery element?
[03:35:56] <mikecmpbll> actually, ignore me.
[03:36:20] <xec> no worries, I ignore everyone
[03:36:25] <hellothere> oh I had to do it in asp <: jquery doesnt help that much on many things
[03:37:21] * xec secretly bets 10 bucks it can be done with .data()
[03:43:14] <krambiorix> is it better to put all jquery code in ONE file or per big functionality a file ?
[03:45:05] <mikecmpbll> :D
[04:03:32] <BinaryKitten> i prefer using modules
[04:03:40] <BinaryKitten> via something like requirejs
[04:15:23] <Whirl3d> I have to make a camera configuration tool that has several components that visually detach from the camera and can be configured individually.  Any suggestions on the best approach for programming it all out?
[04:25:01] <mikecmpbll> is it possible to get the previously selected option in a select element's change handler?
[04:26:00] <mikecmpbll> ah nvm, silly question.
[04:31:04] <hellothere> this ?
[04:34:18] <bberry> does the .append function return the item?
[04:34:45] <hellothere> it appends something
[04:35:03] <bberry> yes, i want that 'something'
[04:35:27] <_rgn> it returns the object you called it on
[04:35:27] <hellothere> .this ?
[04:35:36] <_rgn> like most jquery methods. to allow chainings
[04:37:44] <bberry> so this will work? var myNewItem = foo.append("<div class='bar'>stuff in here</div>");
[04:38:15] <_rgn> no
[04:38:22] <bberry> how would i get the item i just appended
[04:38:22] <_rgn> "returns the object you called it on"
[04:39:24] <_rgn> var myNewItem = $('<div'>); foo.append(myNewItem);
[04:52:51] <bigbugjava> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'thumbnailScroller' localhost/:347
[04:52:51] <bigbugjava> (anonymous function) -> it means it donesn't call nobody right?
[04:54:34] <Cork> bigbugjava: what means?
[04:54:46] <seutje> it means it isn't named
[04:54:49] <Cork> anonymouse function just means it happend in a function with no name function()
[04:54:50] <bigbugjava> trying to add thumbnailScroller, and getting this error
[04:55:09] <Cork> the line before just means the function you call doesn't exist

[05:17:36] <ankurk_> no
[05:27:55] <psz> Hi, I have a question. We have upgraded jQuery from 1.7.x and the selector tr:not(@[data-container=true]) no longer works. What was @ doing?
[05:29:36] <Cork> psz: xpath queries
[05:30:33] <Cork> support was removed in 1.8 or possibly 1.9
[05:30:35] <Cork> not sure
[05:30:36] <psz> ok, so I can assume it was about looking for tr not having attribute with specified value?
[05:30:51] <psz> 1.8, I'm sure about it.
[05:31:11] <Cork> think so ya
[05:31:19] <psz> Ok, thanks!
[05:31:25] <Cork> never used it in jquery so not sure
[05:31:42] <Cork> (the syntax doesn't fully match for normal xpath)
[05:32:20] <psz> yeah, i remember older jqueries got a mix of xpath and css
[05:32:41] <psz> possibly that's the one. i see that on 1.8 release sizzlejs got rewriteen
[05:35:50] <Cork> psz: ya, jquery has been simplefied a lot since 1.5 to 1.9
[05:36:05] <Cork> 1.5 bit me hard in one project
[05:37:35] <anli> Is there a progress indicator in kendoui?
[05:37:58] <anli> I know this is not a kendo channel, but I just wanted to type text in a window
[05:39:14] <Cork> anli: don't think you will get an answer here
[05:39:25] <anli> Me neither
[05:39:30] <anli> Hi Cork btw
[05:39:34] <Cork> o/
[05:39:41] <anli> :)
[05:39:48] <anli> There seems to be some app.pane.loader.show(); function
[05:40:00] <anli> fni
[05:50:21] <xKraty> ankurk_: a stone told me you was looking for me lol, did you get ride of that damn table?
[05:50:56] <ankurk_> oh hell yeah :D
[05:51:15] <xKraty> 3 weeks of work for something that could have be done in 1 :D
[05:51:26] <xKraty> what's struggling your mind now :O ?
[05:54:28] <ankurk_> that actually embarrasses me a lot though
[05:54:45] <ankurk_> 1 week? I could have completed that in 1 day.
[05:55:59] <xKraty> yeah i forgot to type day
[05:56:05] <xKraty> you making porn site :O ?
[05:58:09] <ankurk_> nah, I mean to say that pisses me off a lot
[05:58:18] <ankurk_> with a plugin that could have been easier
[05:58:55] <xKraty> easier is even not enough
[05:59:23] <decx> at least you learned something
[05:59:28] <decx> or did you?
[05:59:59] <xKraty> true
[06:01:13] <ankurk_> decx, that's true, I learned something
[06:01:48] <xKraty> we'll start call decx Mr. Positive
[06:01:48] <ankurk_> everyday I do want to learn something new
[06:02:37] <ankurk_> lol
[06:02:44] <decx> i'm a cynical optimist
[06:08:51] <Elirips> If I add a handler to certain classes, like '$.(".myClas").on("click", ...), if I later add more elements with that class to the document, do I need to set up the handler again?
[06:09:01] <Elirips> so that they trigger the click too?
[06:09:48] <decx> yes
[06:09:56] <krambiorix> i have an int with value 2000.00 and i do myamount.toFixed(20)   and i get  myamount.toFixed is not a function
[06:10:00] <decx> but you can also add the handler to a parent object
[06:10:26] <decx> $('#staticparent').on('click','.myClass',fn)
[06:10:46] <Elirips> decx: thank you
[06:10:52] <decx> now #staticparent will look out for any clicks on .myClass inside it
[06:11:05] <Elirips> thats interesting, I'll test it
[06:11:22] <ankurk_> I really need to spend some time looking jquery's source code
[06:11:28] <xKraty> krambiorix: you need 2000,00
[06:12:22] <xKraty> no no nvm it
[06:13:19] <xKraty> it should work
[06:14:49] <xKraty> http://jsfiddle.net/9X3Tr/
[06:15:11] <krambiorix> xKraty, thanks, but just found out it was a string :s
[06:15:15] <krambiorix> xKraty, thanks though!
[06:15:35] <xKraty> oh yeah always parseInt/parseFloat before using numbers
[06:17:10] <Elirips> decx: must it be a direct parent or can it be any parent?
[06:17:38] <decx> the closer the parent the more efficient
[06:17:48] <decx> as long as it's preset on page load you're good
[06:17:53] <decx> present*
[06:19:42] <Elirips> okay, thanks. Then I must have some other issues. I guess the click is already eaten by the element, and someone prevents it from reaching the parent
[07:23:03] <n0x_42> Could someone check out this jsfiddle and explain why there is 1px being added to each td when the tabs are switched? http://jsfiddle.net/KFcYS/
[07:28:13] <seutje> n0x_42: set the table to width: 100%;
[07:29:12] <seutje> not setting a width makes it determine its own minimum width based on the contents, due to the "- truck" bit wrapping in that one cell, it adds a bit of whitespace
[07:29:14] <n0x_42> seutje the right or left table?
[07:29:25] <seutje> tbh, all tables, allways
[07:29:32] <n0x_42> Ahh ok
[07:29:57] <seutje> I just added it on all table elements: http://jsfiddle.net/KFcYS/2/
[07:30:44] <seutje> usually u want ur tables full-width anyway, xcept maybe content tables
[07:32:33] <n0x_42> It's still doing the same though.
[07:32:33] <n0x_42> There is still 1px being added to the height of each td in the right table when the tabs are switched.
[07:36:19] <n0x_42> Ok, well I just set the height of each td to getRowHeight -1. Cheap solution but I guess it works haha.
[07:36:57] <decx> all the tds stay at 20&40px height respectively regardless of how often i switch
[07:37:22] <seutje> oh, the height? o.O
[07:37:59] <seutje> can you please put the handler on the LI instead of the A, or set the padding on the A instead of the LI, this is so annoying
[07:38:13] <seutje> keep clicking the LI and not triggering the handler
[07:38:21] <decx> these selectors are ridiculous though, cache that shit
[07:38:33] <ankurk_> Whenever I select a file using fileinput, I get this error, "Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" why?
[07:39:28] <seutje> ankurk_: ur references are calling eachother too often
[07:39:53] <cadz> Hi huys, im using this plugin https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin, but my jquery version is 1.4, so i used jQuery.noConflict(), but when i try to use the plugin it wont work, it wont have errors too, so i dont know if my code is wrong, or it just doesnt work even with jquery no conflict. Anyone has idea?
[07:39:56] <seutje> usually a recursive function that keeps on going beyond the stack size limit
[07:40:03] <ankurk_> seutje: I am simply doing this, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/7b78e5688028a06ca232
[07:41:31] <n0x_42> decx what do you mean by cache? Do you have a link to docs I can look at?
[07:41:31] <cadz> Hi huys, im using this plugin https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Basic-plugin, but my jquery version is 1.4, so i used jQuery.noConflict(), but when i try to use the plugin it wont work, it wont have errors too, so i dont know if my code is wrong, or it just doesnt work even with jquery no conflict.

[07:42:01] <seutje> ankurk_: hmz, maybe it's cause ur logging the files
[07:42:20] <cadz> decx: so even if i use jQuery.noConflict(), it wont work?
[07:42:35] <decx> don't know just checked the page
[07:42:40] <ankurk_> Strange, actually I am getting this error when I am calling the bootstrap modal from another modal
[07:42:55] <ankurk_> though it happens when I select file too
[07:43:45] <decx> n0x_42 instead of doing $('.myselector') multiple times you can do var shortstuff = $('.myselector') and call your stuff from there. especially if you have these incredibly long selectors. that's a bunch of overhead you can cut out
[07:44:12] <decx> beware the scope and you'll be fine
[07:46:11] <n0x_42> Oh ok cool, I see. Thanks!
[07:50:18] <nicolas_FR> hi there
[07:51:52] <ankurk_> Hmm, that error was because I was opening a modal on top of another modal
[07:52:57] <nicolas_FR> some validation problem : hard to do a jsfiddle because code is a bit long, but I have a form divided in many "pages" with a continue button. Clicking "continue" loads the validation rules for the page. Fact is, when I can form.valid() for the first time, I have the message : "TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'valid'". If I recall the .valid() right after, it works. Any idea ?
[07:57:52] <cp1025> afternoon all :)
[07:58:43] <Dirkos> $('#chart input[name="from"], #chart input[name="till"]').change(function(){
[07:58:54] <Dirkos> how can it be that i see this event triggered 3 times?
[07:59:27] <cp1025> Ive been trying to get this working for a while now!, i need to use jquery to respond to keypress, well, keyup is probably good, and then when a certain key is pressed, load a php file
[07:59:31] <cp1025> any ideas? :)
[08:00:16] <nicolas_FR> cp1025: like a redirect on some key pressed ?
[08:00:19] <Dirkos> if i change it to "blur" it is only triggered once
[08:00:55] <cp1025> yea, essentially, yes, if i press 0 on the numpad open accept.php if i press 1 decline.php
[08:00:56] <nicolas_FR> Dirkos: what are the type of the input ?
[08:01:22] <nicolas_FR> cp1025: can't you use a document.location.href="page.php" ?
[08:01:26] <Dirkos> a think its because of the datepicker plugin which is registered on it
[08:02:01] <nicolas_FR> Dirkos : might be indeed, do a jsfiddle with it maybe
[08:02:11] <JesseJ> hello, do you know any login plugins which store user login session duration?
[08:02:28] <cp1025> nicholas, how can i do that? :)
[08:03:00] <nicolas_FR> http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:03:54] <nicolas_FR> cp1025: you can specify which jquery lib you're using, ext lib like datepicker, and then test your code
[08:04:56] <Dirkos> nicolas_FR: indeed the datepicker :) use the changeDate event on itself
[08:05:25] <nicolas_FR> JesseJ: a jquery plugin for session ?
[08:08:15] <ankurk_> I am getting this error now, "Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation", on the ajax call, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/82d8d5b7bdeeba61d82a
[08:08:28] <ankurk_> Why?
[08:12:07] <krambiorix> i want to set a property with as name the id of a field, but this doesn't work... afschrijving.$(this).attr('id') = 1    What can i do?
[08:12:32] <JesseJ> nicolas_FR: i need a login system for my website, which keeps track of session duration times, ie:: how long a user stays logged in
[08:12:34] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: this is not the way attr works
[08:13:16] <nicolas_FR> JesseJ: session are server side, JS is client. So you can access session directly from JS
[08:13:51] <JesseJ> nicolas_FR:  what plugins do you know?
[08:13:56] <JesseJ> login systems i mean
[08:14:21] <NoiseEee> JesseJ: all you can do is infer/guess really
[08:14:25] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, ?
[08:14:27] <nicolas_FR> JesseJ: can't
[08:14:39] <krambiorix> NoiseEee, any idea?
[08:14:59] <NoiseEee> krambiorix: .prop
[08:15:07] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: https://api.jquery.com/attr/
[08:17:11] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: $(field).attr("key","value")
[08:19:01] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, afschrijving.$(this).attr('id') = 1    ---->afschrijving is an object .... I think you misunderstood
[08:20:01] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: might be indeed, what do you want to achieve ? Can you do a jsfiddle ?
[08:21:51] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, i want to set the property which is the value of $(this).attr('id')
[08:24:01] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: 1min
[08:25:56] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/TEp5M/
[08:26:23] <abishek> can someone suggest me a jquery plugin that I can use to load paginated results when reaching to the bottom of an element, more like how facebook wall works
[08:27:16] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/TEp5M/1/
[08:28:14] <decx> abishek the technique is most widely called infinite scroll and paul irishs script by the same name is probably the most popular
[08:29:14] <abishek> decx, thnx
[08:31:29] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, this is what i want , but it doesn't work : http://jsfiddle.net/TEp5M/2/
[08:36:20] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: here : http://jsfiddle.net/TEp5M/3/
[08:37:22] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, i thought: afschrijving.prop($(this).attr('id'),$(this).val());  but that doesn't work too
[08:38:31] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: 1 - prop is a jquery function. you can't call it on a js object if it's not a jquery object
[08:38:56] <decx> i don't even get what's going on here
[08:39:19] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: you have the eval your vars, so it writes object.property = value
[08:39:24] <decx> so the id of an element should be a variable inside an object literal
[08:39:26] <decx> ?
[08:39:41] <nicolas_FR> http://jsfiddle.net/TEp5M/3/ is working btw
[08:40:43] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, yes it works
[08:40:54] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, i'll do it like that
[08:40:57] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, thanks!!!
[08:41:06] <decx> isnt eval evil
[08:41:30] <nicolas_FR> decx:  yes it is :) but right now I don't see another solution
[08:41:52] <ankurk_> Well I am getting illegal invocation on ajax, I don't know why, https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/0fea099dfb74b9b53e68
[08:42:01] <decx> i do, change the approach ^^
[08:42:39] <nicolas_FR> oh yes ! you can change object.property by object["property"]
[08:42:43] <nicolas_FR> which is nicer
[08:42:47] <ankurk_> Is it because I am not stringifying the data?
[08:42:48] <nicolas_FR> my bad
[08:44:02] <nicolas_FR> krambiorix: just use object[$(field).attr("id")]="value";
[08:44:13] <krambiorix> yes :D
[08:44:18] <krambiorix> nicolas_FR, i do
[08:44:35] <decx> that's slightly less ridiculous yes
[08:44:40] <nicolas_FR> decx: ;)
[08:45:10] <DRSK> <h1 data-something-(top|right|bottom|left)="somethingelse"></h1> <-- can I build one selector to fetch them all? :p
[08:45:28] <DRSK> $( '[data-something]*' ) or something
[08:45:52] <decx> i think there's only a contains selector for the value
[08:45:55] <DRSK> I'm guessing it's not as easy. But worth a shot! Anyone know how?
[08:47:05] <duch_kazatel> gooood morning folks
[08:49:19] <DRSK> how can I tell from what selector I managed to scope an element?
[08:49:52] <duch_kazatel> "scope an element" wut
[08:50:39] <DRSK> var bla = $( 'a, p' ); then say I use an $.each on bla. How can I know if say $(this) came from a or p?
[08:51:20] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to look at the nodeType.
[08:51:54] <duch_kazatel> ooh, maybe not.
[08:52:00] <Clex> DRSK: maybe somehting like $(this).get(0).tagName
[08:52:12] <duch_kazatel> .prop('tagname")
[08:52:20] <duch_kazatel> err, .prop('tagName')
[08:53:03] <DRSK> Okay, my question wasn't even accurate. I'm using data-something-direction on various elements in my document. Now I'm gathering all these data-something ones in a variable. Then I'm trying to 'each' this variable and console.log their data-something-X values.
[08:53:08] <duch_kazatel> be aware that'll return the tagname in all caps.
[08:53:34] <duch_kazatel> DRSK variables != nodes.
[08:53:55] <duch_kazatel> DRSK can you craft up an example using jsfiddle?
[08:54:04] <DRSK> Indeed!
[08:54:23] <nicolas_FR> DRSK: $("[property]") is working
[08:54:39] <DRSK> http://jsfiddle.net/7W9jV/ phew.
[08:54:59] <DRSK> So, having that there. How do I account for all variations of tooltip-X and how do I use their values? :)
[08:55:23] <DRSK> I get how I can return it came from a <p> or an <h1> or whatnot, but the actual .data() thing I'm not so sure about.
[08:55:29] <b0bi> Hi, I used .clone(true,true) on a div that had a combobox, it looks like it cloned it, but when I try to change the selected option in the new combobox, it does not display the actual selection (looks like combobox gui stays frozen)
[08:55:36] <duch_kazatel> DRSK that's a bad idea.
[08:55:40] <b0bi> Is it a known problem?
[08:55:44] <duch_kazatel> DRSK that's going to be terribly slow.
[08:56:11] <DRSK> duch_kazatel Â» I kinda felt that was like using *, expensive. Yeah. What are my options here if I may ask?
[08:56:21] <duch_kazatel> use a class.
[08:56:31] <duch_kazatel> b0bi you'll probably need to re-initialize the combobox.
[08:56:49] <b0bi> duch_kazatel, how would I do that?
[08:57:00] <duch_kazatel> b0bi no clue - not sure what code you're using.
[08:57:05] <DRSK> duch_kazatel Â» yeah I can see how that'd be easier, but then again I need to have the actual information somewhere?
[08:57:39] <b0bi> simple bootstrap combobox, I just cloned it.
[08:57:41] <duch_kazatel> DRSK you need to know the attribute names ahead of time.  what you're doing right now will be very slow, because that's going to parse the document manually for each attribute.
[08:57:59] <duch_kazatel> DRSK this sounds like an XY problem.  what are you trying to solve by doing this?
[08:58:16] <decx> have two data-attributes data-something-direction="top" data-something-value="5"
[08:58:29] <nicolas_FR> DRSK: your solution for selecting with partial property name : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12199008/find-html-based-on-partial-attribute
[08:58:51] <duch_kazatel> selecting via partial property name is a bad idea, btw.  that's going to be very slow.
[09:00:24] <DRSK> decx Â» data-tooltip-text + data-tooltip-position = good plan. But how do I gather them without it being insanely resourceful as duch_kazatel outlined?
[09:00:42] <duch_kazatel> DRSK you need to start adding classes to your markup and target those.
[09:00:46] <decx> class&context
[09:00:48] <duch_kazatel> mind explaining your core problem?
[09:00:49] <DRSK> duch_kazatel Â» I do not know the attributes in beforehand, and I never will. It's up to the user to decide.
[09:01:09] <duch_kazatel> DRSK uh, why not?
[09:01:35] <DRSK> I'm thinking about a solution to a problem where giving users the possibility to add tooltips to any element they want, simply by providing an additional (or two) attributes to that element.
[09:02:00] <DRSK> And so I thought data-X-Y is epic for this. In conjunction with .data() I'm home! But apparently whatever I do it's too expensive :p
[09:02:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:02:08] <NoiseEee> DRSK: so maybe they should all get the class 'userAddedTooltip'
[09:02:16] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[09:02:18] <DRSK> Right, but where does the user enter the information?
[09:02:19] <NoiseEee> and then you can confine yoru query to those
[09:02:26] <duch_kazatel> class="userAddedToolTip"
[09:02:38] <DRSK> I can add a class to the element. No big issue, let's do that to select the tooltipped elements.
[09:02:43] <TheEternalAbyss> hello... if I want to have jquery make an option selected is it $("#optionID selected.option") ?
[09:02:46] <duch_kazatel> that's the smart thing to do.
[09:03:01] <DRSK> then I use .data('tooltip-X') on the selection?
[09:03:11] <duch_kazatel> query the specific data attributes.
[09:03:16] <duch_kazatel> is this for a plugin you're writing?
[09:03:20] <DRSK> I'm starting to see the bigger picture here, so please go on :)
[09:03:30] <DRSK> No I'm just fiddeling around with what might work or what might not work at the moment
[09:04:27] <DRSK> So let's add classes to the tooltipped elements so we can neatly select them inexpensively. Sounds good. Then we use the data-specific attributes to output the actual information? Is that basically what we're saying here?
[09:04:37] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[09:05:08] <duch_kazatel> have you looked at how others do it?
[09:06:28] <DRSK> duch_kazatel Â» no, I haven't actually. I asked myself how I would do it and I'd use data-tags for the information, what I wasn't aware of was how expensive it was to actually use that as the selector for the elements as well. So we got that figured out, thank you!
[09:07:16] <duch_kazatel> DRSK you do realize you could, for instance, use a constructor to create "instances" of the tooltips, right?  and assign data through that mechanism instead?  or you can do it the bootstrap way and read data from data attributes.
[09:08:17] <DRSK> So, for the first thing you mentioned I'd "build" all tooltips beforehand and then just 'call them' when needed? And the latter example I'd do what exactly?
[09:08:47] <DRSK> and again, I appreciate you tossing ideas :) I'm just curious at this point.
[09:09:06] <duch_kazatel> you'd build them and inject them into the document where needed with the appropriate styling.  use event bindings to then show/hide as needed.
[09:09:17] <duch_kazatel> the bootstrap way is the way you're looking to do it.
[09:09:56] <DRSK> Meaning the more expensive approach? It works but it's not as optimal? Or, you mean the way you guys pointed me I could do it?
[09:10:16] <duch_kazatel> huh?  i mean read data from data attributes.
[09:10:33] <duch_kazatel> the issue with your original approach was not accessing data attributes, it was selecting on them.
[09:11:04] <DRSK> Indeed, all right I'm with you :)
[09:11:19] <duch_kazatel> i'd look at the source of something like http://stevenbenner.github.io/jquery-powertip/ to get a better sense of how you might approach this.
[09:11:56] <diegoviola> hi
[09:11:59] <DRSK> Thanks!
[09:12:02] <decx> what's a good way to intersect 3 or more objects or arrays. for example i want my collision code to apply from everything in projectiles[] to enemies[] and level[], and everything from level[] vs player. right now i'm stacking for loops separately
[09:12:10] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:12:32] <diegoviola> i have a html document with lots of <input /> with the same id, how do i refer to all those when trying to do something with the js? $('').something()?
[09:12:57] <decx> id is the identifier and must be unique
[09:13:16] <decx> uses classes
[09:13:21] <decx> -s
[09:14:09] <diegoviola> thanks
[09:15:19] <diegoviola> that works
[09:18:48] <duch_kazatel> back
[09:18:50] <cadz> can anyone solve this, i have this problem for two days now. please. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22176571/can-i-use-any-version-of-jquery-using-jquery-noconflict/22177626?noredirect=1#22177626
[09:19:23] <duch_kazatel> cadz woah.  1.4 is ancient.
[09:19:35] <cadz> duch_kazatel: yeah, dont ask. :(
[09:19:43] <TheEternalAbyss> ok I'll rephrase my question. I have several option elements and I want to be able to choose which loads by default by essentially setting it to SELECTED. How do I do that?
[09:19:46] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to do the migration at some point. i'm in the middle of one myself.
[09:19:55] <duch_kazatel> the other approach might be to upgrade and use jquery migrate.
[09:20:13] <cadz> duch_kazatel: yes, its a plan, but for now its not.
[09:20:18] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss why notdo it through your HTML?
[09:20:21] <duch_kazatel> instead of jquery?
[09:21:10] <duch_kazatel> either way, set .attr('selected', 'selected') for the option you want selected.
[09:21:29] <TheEternalAbyss> because it has to be set on page load.. this is the thing: I have the user's chosen option stored in localStorage. I check to see what they selected so it loads as the default selected item
[09:21:44] <TheEternalAbyss> ah
[09:21:47] <TheEternalAbyss> ok thanks
[09:35:49] <d0de> does anyone have an iPad handy and might be willing to help me out for 30 seconds?
[09:37:18] <TheEternalAbyss> duch_kazatel: that doesn't see to set my element
[09:38:29] <duch_kazatel> "that doesn't see to set my element"
[09:38:31] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:39:04] <TheEternalAbyss> there's no change in the html. I need <option> to become <option selected>
[09:39:36] <duch_kazatel> because of the way jquery works, you need to set the "selected" attribute to something.
[09:39:45] <duch_kazatel> so .attr('selected', 'selected') is what you want./
[09:40:00] <TheEternalAbyss> yea.. but I need the html to change
[09:40:15] <duch_kazatel> are you looking at the underlying markup, or at the rendered markup?
[09:40:33] <TheEternalAbyss> rendered I suppose...
[09:40:57] <TheEternalAbyss> yes cause I need to know what's been loaded first, and then select that as the default
[09:41:07] <TheEternalAbyss> so it needs to be rendered already
[09:41:25] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't answer my question ;).  are you looking in the developer tools?
[09:41:32] <TheEternalAbyss> shouldn't replaceWith work for me?
[09:41:38] <TheEternalAbyss> yes I have dev tools up
[09:41:55] <duch_kazatel> i don't see what replacewith has to do with the question.
[09:41:56] <TheEternalAbyss> i'm looking at rendered
[09:42:05] <duch_kazatel> brb
[09:42:31] <TheEternalAbyss> ok this isn't complicated.. I need the html to go from <option>foo</option> to <option selected>foo</option>
[09:43:46] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: $('select').val('foo')
[09:44:21] <BillCriswell> Though, if no other option is selected the first one is already selected.
[09:45:02] <TheEternalAbyss> yes by default
[09:45:08] <TheEternalAbyss> ok i'll try that, thank you
[09:47:47] <DannyFritz> i need to select a tr that doesn't have a parent tr. is that possible with a jquery selector?
[09:48:14] <DannyFritz> nvmd, i think i can solve it a better way
[09:49:19] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/NF3nm/3/
[09:49:31] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss ^^ this is one way to do it.
[09:50:27] <TheEternalAbyss> hmm
[09:50:36] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you... maybe my if statement is incorrect
[09:50:41] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/NF3nm/4/
[09:50:45] <duch_kazatel> with both examples.
[09:50:56] <TheEternalAbyss> cause it's not triggering the select
[09:51:16] <TheEternalAbyss> ok i see
[09:51:34] <TheEternalAbyss> thank you duch_kazatel  and BillCriswell. I think I can get this working the way I want now
[09:51:35] <TheEternalAbyss> :)
[09:51:59] <duch_kazatel> of course.
[09:52:02] <duch_kazatel> how goes, BillCriswell
[09:52:20] <BillCriswell> It's all right. Just had a 2 hour meeting which was brutal. Thinking about finding a bridge.
[09:52:33] <duch_kazatel> uh oh...
[09:52:36] <duch_kazatel> what happened?
[09:52:40] <TheEternalAbyss> ew
[09:53:24] <duch_kazatel> neeeeetspliiiiiiit
[09:53:34] <greenland> ohshi-
[09:54:24] <TheEternalAbyss> the dom needs to be ready for this to work doesn't it..
[09:54:36] <duch_kazatel> TheEternalAbyss well yeah...
[09:54:51] <TheEternalAbyss> yea... maybe that's why it's not working for me lol
[09:54:57] <TheEternalAbyss> let me move this..... 0=)
[09:56:14] <duch_kazatel> woah.  i just found a copy of jquery 1.1 in our codebase.
[09:56:20] <duch_kazatel> it was hiding.
[09:56:25] <TheEternalAbyss> yay it woiks
[09:56:45] <TheEternalAbyss> thanks again... now I can go eat some lunch
[10:04:43] <andywww> possibly not the best place to ask this but i have no doubt many have come acrss this problem before. Is it possible to have the twitter tweet button take prefill infomration from a meta tag and switch that meta tag out with jquery?
[10:04:46] <andywww> the latter i can do
[10:04:53] <andywww> the former, i'm strugling with
[10:06:19] <greenland> i'm trying to get the position() of an element nested in a div set to display:overflow and it seems to be doing offset() relative to the document instead. How screwed am I?
[10:13:40] <Dreagos> hello all
[10:14:48] <Dreagos> so I'm working on a jquery drag and drop, and I'm trying to make the helper disappear once dropped instead of staying. Once dropped a textbox will show with the applied value
[10:15:45] <Dreagos> What attribute do I need to set for that?
[10:16:07] <greenland> yo. okay. easier question now: if i'm setting a variable to something from a jquery selection, is it considered best practice to denote that with a $ prefix? or do i just stick with foo?
[10:16:49] <duch_kazatel> prefix it with $
[10:17:00] <greenland> rock on, duch
[10:17:27] <duch_kazatel> but only when it's a jquery object.
[10:31:10] <nhulea> duch_kazatel: hows it goin!
[10:32:06] <duch_kazatel> it's all right.  hgow're you?
[10:32:12] <duch_kazatel> *how're
[10:32:53] <nhulea> well not too bad at all !

[10:34:51] <Havvy> Does .first() return the very first element in the jQuery set, or does it return the element that is first on the page?
[10:35:03] <Havvy> And if it is the former, how can I do the latter?
[10:35:13] <crgwbr> re: http://jsfiddle.net/crgwbr/j3CQ9/3/ In Firefox, try scrolling part way down the page and dragging the dialog
[10:35:44] <duch_kazatel> it returns the first in the jquery set.
[10:35:46] <duch_kazatel> iirc.
[10:35:47] <crgwbr> Havvy: :first is the first in the set. :first-child is the latter
[10:36:21] <Havvy> crgwbr:  :first-child just checks to make sure the element is the first child of its parent.
[10:37:05] <crgwbr> Havvy: "body > *:first" might do what you need
[10:38:13] <duch_kazatel> all right i'm off to meet a man about my pool.
[10:38:16] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks
[10:38:21] <Havvy> crgwbr:  Is that a filter? Or a selector that I use my current set as context?
[10:39:14] <crgwbr> Havvy: thats a selector. So, if you already have a set, you could check if it's the first on the page by using mySet.is("body > *:first")
[10:39:51] <Dreagos> hmmm
[10:40:00] <Havvy> Lemme rephrase my requirements.
[10:40:43] <PenguinMan98> Jquery blockUI question.  When displaying a form using blockUI, the wait cursor appears on the overlay as expected but also within the displayed div except in the input fields.  Why is this?  I want the cursor to be the normal pointer inside the form.
[10:40:59] <Havvy> I have an unordered jQuery set. I want to grab the element from the set that is the first on the page with respect to the other elements of the set
[10:42:14] <shoky> crgwbr: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9315
[10:42:24] <Havvy> In this case, they are the set of inputs with errors.
[10:43:55] <crgwbr> shoky: Thanks! Any ETA on a fix? Or a workaround?
[10:45:29] <shoky> crgwbr: i donno when 1.11 is out.. not sure about a workaround. sry ;p
[10:51:46] <PenguinMan98> I did some searching on their webpage for an answer but couldn't find one.  Also the oracle of google wasn't clear.
[11:12:41] <mikedoty> http://paste2.org/zzgP47DH  I'm trying to find a reason why the POST data in an ajax call would not get sent with the request.  Does anyone know of certain scenarios that can cause the request to be sent without the POST data?
[11:14:09] <lukey> Hi is anyone experienced with phonegap at all? I try to create an App from my jquery-mobile site, and then via the command line. But both times  it produced was an example "Hello world" app
[11:14:58] <BillCriswell> lukey: like after "phonegap create appname" ?
[11:15:01] <Dreagos> http://pastebin.com/xb9ujzqF
[11:15:10] <lukey> BillCriswell: kinda, yeah
[11:15:21] <Dreagos> why is it saying that the attribute it looks for doesn't exist?
[11:16:19] <lukey> BillCriswell: The docs say: home/lukey/bin/phonegap create path/to/my-app "com.example.app" "My App"
[11:16:59] <lukey> My site is composed of .asp files BillCriswell I don't know if that makes a difference
[11:20:53] <shoky> mikedoty: donno if it's related but first of all you should use encodeURIComponent instead of escape,  2nd of all just let jquery do it for you:  data: { field1: field1, field2: field2, r: Math.random() }
[11:21:33] <BillCriswell> lukey: Do you get like the "Device Is Ready" screen?
[11:23:35] <PenguinMan98> whoa, weird
[11:24:10] <PenguinMan98> I just got this interesting situation where my site starts infinitely loading two javascript files.  One then the next then the other over and over and over again.
[11:24:30] <PenguinMan98> I'm not using import in either file
[11:25:13] <mikedoty> shoky:  Thanks.  Agreed that using a hash of values is a better way, and I'll switch to encodeURIComponent just to remove that from the list of possible causes.
[11:25:46] <PenguinMan98> Any ideas?
[11:29:52] <blizzkid> Lo all. Is this the correct way: http://pastebin.com/WZ4eu9Ck? I'm trying to get http://www.jqueryscript.net/slideshow/Lightweight-jQuery-Background-Slideshow-Plugin-BgSwitcher.html working in a new Drupal theme I'm developing
[11:42:12] <lukey> BillCriswell: no I don't get that far.
[11:45:57] <BillCriswell> lukey: I'm still learning how to use it as well lol. I expected "phonegap create foo" to take the directory I ran it from and make it into an "app" but I think I was mistaking. I think phonegap reate foo just gives you a boilerplate to work from.
[11:46:16] <duch_away> blizzkid did you get the help you needed?
[11:47:10] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: not yet, but quickly trying something else. Give me 2 minutes.
[11:47:23] <duch_kazatel> kay
[11:47:43] <lukey> BillCriswell: I'm starting to wonder this as well
[11:48:54] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: ok, the other thing I tried, isn't working either
[11:49:33] <PenguinMan98> fixed it.  I'd mucked up the html so the javascript was tring to load html that included a javascript include.   include-ception
[11:50:27] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid ok.  can you make a fiddle or soemthing?
[11:50:30] <duch_kazatel> *something
[11:50:44] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: ok, hold on
[11:50:52] <BillCriswell> lukey: Just asked in #phonegap, seems the case.
[11:53:03] <duch_kazatel> anybody here heard of the Baymard Institute?
[11:53:16] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/wr3kz/1/
[11:53:38] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid woah.  uhh...
[11:53:42] <lukey> BillCriswell: Thanks I didn't know about this channel
[11:53:55] <duch_kazatel> do you have that plugin hosted somewhere?
[11:54:00] <invinceable> i am going to use a .get() call to hit an endpoint on my server. what happens if the user navigates off of the page before the get() returns anything (i.e. the server side code is still processing), it should not matter if the only thing I am worried about is the initial endpoint on my server being hit right?
[11:54:13] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: http://www.jqueryscript.net/slideshow/Lightweight-jQuery-Background-Slideshow-Plugin-BgSwitcher.html
[11:54:28] <BillCriswell> lukey: Like... 78% of the time I just type /j #someproject and I get something relatively useful.
[11:54:41] <BillCriswell> Maybe more like 68%... I'm only sure about the ending 8.
[11:54:49] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: the plugin is not mine (just to make that clear ;))
[11:55:19] <Bloomberg> hi
[11:55:20] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/PnyFfZT.png
[11:55:27] <lukey> cheers :)
[11:55:54] <Bloomberg> someone know some way of preview in the browser the changes onlive in a template html?
[11:56:45] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/wr3kz/2/ :)
[11:57:08] <duch_kazatel> close.  http://jsfiddle.net/wr3kz/3/
[11:57:31] <blizzkid> ok
[11:57:40] <blizzkid> my bad
[11:57:50] <duch_kazatel> so are you asking how to use it?
[11:58:21] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: I can't get it to show the pictures, obviously in the fiddle we'll have to use some external pics
[11:58:40] <blizzkid> Somehow javascript doesn't like me
[11:58:53] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid your first problem will be the version of JS you're using.
[11:58:57] <duch_kazatel> 1.6.4 is ancient.
[11:59:41] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel:  Drupal 7...
[11:59:59] <duch_kazatel> then you can't use the plugin./
[12:00:13] <duch_kazatel> it's trying to use a function that didn't exist back then.
[12:00:41] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid are you familiar with the console?
[12:01:12] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: what console do you mean? I use that term in at least 3 different ways :)
[12:01:55] <duch_kazatel> the context should give you everything you need: the one in firebug/dev tools.
[12:02:42] <Mou5e> I'm looking at some code that says: "$('circle').tooltip(container: 'body')". I can't find the 'container' option in the tooltip documentation!
[12:03:40] <duch_kazatel> Mou5e sounds like you're not using jqueryui maybe?
[12:04:03] <Mou5e> I guess not :/
[12:05:18] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: I am indeed familiar with that console. I've updated my jquery to 1.8 (the newest I can use atm)
[12:05:32] <duch_kazatel> and are you seeing any errors within the console?
[12:05:38] <duch_kazatel> (you shouldn't any longer)
[12:06:52] <imjakechapman> hey guys, anyone have hands on experience with ajaxify and history.js?
[12:07:39] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: yep indeed it's working now. Guess I must have missed the minimal version requirement when reading the doc :(
[12:08:27] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid i didn't even look at the docs - i just noticed the plugin was trying to use .on() which didn't exist back then.
[12:08:31] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ imjakechapman
[12:08:32] <b-ot> imjakechapman: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:08:50] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: but you know js :)
[12:08:55] <imjakechapman> duch_kazatel, my bad..
[12:09:28] <BillCriswell> I think drupal needs to nest these divs like.... 4 time deeper.
[12:09:41] <imjakechapman> Was curious about seeing if you can find the current progress for page load through an ajaxify/history.js page request when a link is triggered, to easily implement something like pace.js loading bar
[12:09:49] <duch_kazatel> blizzkid checking the console is a great first step - I'd get used to leaving it open.  it'll reveal things pretty quickly for you.  when you see all-out errors, it gives you a place to start.
[12:10:00] <imjakechapman> First time implementing ajaxify or history.js on a site and it's one thing I want to be able to do with it.
[12:10:22] <duch_kazatel> imjakechapman are you using the history.js from balupton or whoever it is?
[12:10:33] <imjakechapman> yes.
[12:10:42] <blizzkid> duch_kazatel: I agree, but since I know next to nothing about js, they're not really helping me. But, you're right, and you've been a fantastic help!
[12:10:57] <imjakechapman> Seems like his is the most stable and best working that other people based theirs off of.
[12:11:00] <duch_kazatel> imjakechapman i wouldn't use it if I were you.  it only ever gave me headaches - roll your own support for pushstates and hashes.
[12:11:15] <duch_kazatel> but either way, that won't give you pageload status.
[12:11:28] <imjakechapman> is it possible to get pageload status via ajax?
[12:12:27] <duch_kazatel> i'm lookiung to see how you might.
[12:13:26] <NoiseEee> imjakechapman: pageload of what?
[12:13:43] <NoiseEee> ah nm
[12:14:04] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/20095157/923919
[12:14:18] <duch_kazatel> you'll use ajax for it, assuming you're not chunking the response.
[12:14:37] <duch_kazatel> xhr.addEventListener("progress", function(evt){ will be key for what you're doing.
[12:15:20] <imjakechapman> so a combination of using evt.lengthComputable and evt.loaded / evt.total
[12:15:24] <imjakechapman> awesome.
[12:15:34] <duch_kazatel> on the xhr object, yeah.
[12:15:39] <imjakechapman> thanks duch_kazatel
[12:15:53] <duch_kazatel> and like I said, avoid history.js - it was terribly unhelpful in my case.
[12:16:18] <checkit> Hello all.... So I created a lil js thingy to filter <li> items on page based on query in a search box on keyup/paste... Which works pretty well. But, I've tried indexOf, search, match and it only seems to be return results where the query matches the beginning of a given string. I need results return where any match within string occurs. Any suggestions here?
[12:16:39] <duch_kazatel> checkit have a fiddle?
[12:16:56] <checkit> i don't... actually... duch_kazatel
[12:17:04] <Ericx2x> hey, i'm a bit confused.. is this lightbox plugin free or do I need to buy a license for it? http://buckwilson.me/lightboxme/
[12:17:07] <duch_kazatel> then go make one :)
[12:17:38] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x huh?  why are you confused?
[12:18:38] <Ericx2x> it says it's under the 'apache license'
[12:18:43] <Ericx2x> but it's on github
[12:18:51] <duch_kazatel> right/.
[12:18:59] <duch_kazatel> are you familiar with the apache license?
[12:19:01] <Ericx2x> i usually think of github as open source and free
[12:19:07] <Ericx2x> no i'm not familar with the apache licnese
[12:19:12] <duch_kazatel> apache is a free webserver.
[12:19:22] <Ericx2x> oh ok
[12:19:24] <duch_kazatel> https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0)
[12:19:31] <duch_kazatel> read this.
[12:19:39] <Ericx2x> thanks
[12:23:51] <jhoffmcd> hello, trying to get a function to update html() whenver any radio buttons are clicked.
[12:24:08] <checkit> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/yHb3M/
[12:24:30] <jhoffmcd> Its only updating when one specific radiobutton is clicked
[12:25:24] <duch_kazatel> checkit so first of all, you want > -1
[12:25:45] <jhoffmcd> Im wondering, is there a force update element html that I can do?
[12:26:10] <duch_kazatel> checkit http://jsfiddle.net/yHb3M/2/
[12:26:36] <duch_kazatel> jhoffmcd there's no way we can help you with the iuformation provided.  fiddle it?
[12:26:46] <checkit> duch_kazatel: Damn... that solved it... Thanks bud
[12:27:00] <duch_kazatel> i also swapped to a simle if / else
[12:27:13] <duch_kazatel> instead of the conditional.
[12:30:08] <invinceable> i am going to use a .get() call to hit an endpoint on my server. what happens if the user navigates off of the page before the get() returns anything (i.e. the server side code is still processing), it should not matter if the only thing I am worried about is the initial endpoint on my server being hit right?
[12:31:21] <shoky> invinceable: once your server gets hit, its hit..
[12:31:26] <Dreagos> how do I fix the overflow for drag + drop? If I drop an item on something, the overflow is still on the page just invisible. So when I drop something it could accidently be bound to the wrong object
[12:32:05] <Dreagos> How do I tell stuff to NOT drop onto the hidden stuff?
[12:34:37] <greenland> does anybody know how to finagle .closest() to work with regard for overflow:scroll?
[12:35:12] <invinceable> shoky: great
[12:35:47] <duch_kazatel> shouldn't matter to you.
[12:35:47] <duch_kazatel> it's a get request, just like when you hit a page.
[12:35:51] <duch_kazatel> greenland... wut?
[12:36:43] <greenland> i've some horizontal scrolling action going on and i want it to snap to an interval for the closest section in the scrolling content
[12:37:22] <greenland> i can do it with Math.round(n / iv) * iv; for scroll values in pixels, but just using closest() is obviously cooler
[12:38:07] <duch_kazatel> .closes() won't do what you want in this case it looks like.
[12:38:30] <greenland> fiddlesticks
[12:38:45] <duch_kazatel> don't write code that finagles things.  write code that works.
[12:38:59] <greenland> finagling is a kind of working!
[12:39:13] <duch_kazatel> that you'll go back to later and say "what was I thinking?"
[12:39:25] <BillCriswell> greenland: What do you mean work with regard to overflow scroll?
[12:39:36] <greenland> ...i gave up on sanity when i found out that my markup has relevant whitespace that breaks the layout
[12:40:02] <BillCriswell> greenland: Sounds like inline-block problems.
[12:41:26] <greenland> BillCriswell: I mean when i do $overflowElement.closest($overflowElement.children()) it always picks the topleftmost one without consideration for it being scrolled 99999px overflowed away with another element directly in the VISIBLE top left
[12:42:06] <greenland> BillCriswell: margin:-4px for teh looz... Inline block shenanigans, naturally.
[12:42:07] <duch_kazatel> yeah you want visible "closest".
[12:42:28] <greenland> duch_kazatel: is there a such thing as visible closest?
[12:42:40] <duch_kazatel> not without crazy finagling :)
[12:42:49] <greenland> suspected as much
[12:45:15] <BillCriswell> greenland: I'm confused. How are you using .closest() on children?
[12:46:49] <greenland> parent element says "which of my dear children is closest to my heart?", and it calculates this by it's entire enclosed box without consideration for overflowed content visibly moving elements closer or away
[12:47:44] <BillCriswell> greenland: .closest() looks at the ancestors, not the descendants... as far as I know?
[12:48:44] <BillCriswell> Yes, ancestors. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:55:01] <BillCriswell> greenland: It sounds to me like you want something like: $overflowElement.children().filter(function(){ return $(this).offset().left > 500 }); or some shit.
[12:55:52] <BillCriswell> I agree with duch_kazatel about it being a not so good way to approach it.
[12:56:13] <greenland> where 500 = half of the content width interval?
[12:56:54] <BillCriswell> greenland: I guess. I just picked a number that sounds offscreen. I meant to do: < -500 though.
[12:57:06] <BillCriswell> Depends how you're setting them offsreen or whatever.
[13:00:13] <greenland> http://hastebin.com/nobajajide.coffee success!
[13:00:37] <greenland> where 1280 = section width
[13:00:57] * greenland gets lectured about using fixed px widths
[13:01:20] <BillCriswell> I have no idea what's going on.
[13:04:53] <BillCriswell> Man, over organization sucks nearly as much as unorganization.
[13:06:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell oh?
[13:06:46] <duch_kazatel> sounds like a shitty work day.  you should come work for us :)
[13:07:21] <farn5w0rth> anyone know of a good plugin that lets you highlight parts of a page and shows the user instructions (for first time users)
[13:07:53] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's just been very busy! Haha, I like it here, though! Maybe one day.
[13:08:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Where abouts are you?
[13:08:26] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: hopskotch was one.
[13:08:58] <BillCriswell> franckbenoit: https://github.com/linkedin/hopscotch
[13:10:02] <felixjet> if i have a layout html where i include all jquery plugins and main.js with all jquery functions/loaders ... whats the best solution to only execute those functions based on the page i am ? because im getting errors because something loaded in a page where it doesnt contain the trigger, etc
[13:10:04] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: ^^ * My bad.
[13:10:22] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: There's another one I recall... can't think of what it's called, though.
[13:11:03] <farn5w0rth> lol cool wait why your bad BillCriswell
[13:11:18] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: I'm never mad, just annoyed on occasion haha
[13:12:00] <BillCriswell> felixjet: You can test the length of an element before trying to do something, like if( $('.mightNotExist').length ) { /* It exists! */ }
[13:12:13] <PenguinMan98> Can anybody help with a facebook API question? This is the problem I'm having (as written by somebody else) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18686768/facebook-xd-arbiter-php-json-parse?rq=1
[13:12:23] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: you were annoyed by me? I'm confused
[13:12:35] <felixjet> BillCriswell, thats the best method?
[13:12:49] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: No, not at all haha
[13:13:02] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: lol coolio :P
[13:13:03] <BillCriswell> At this moment I am bothered by over organization.
[13:14:06] <farn5w0rth> BillCriswell: this is dope http://linkedin.github.io/hopscotch/ thanks dude
[13:14:16] <BillCriswell> farn5w0rth: No problem.
[13:15:00] <BillCriswell> felixjet: I'd probably test to see if it exists before I try to do anything that can cause an error.
[13:29:14] <greenland> apparently hopscotch is amazing
[13:49:56] <intellix> $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['Content-Type'] won't be used for GET requests right? how can I make ALL $http requests to use that setting?
[13:51:41] <intellix> I was under the impression that "common" meant all :P
[13:53:45] <Ericx5x> what is it called when you scroll down and effects happen?
[13:54:09] <intellix> animation
[13:55:00] <BillCriswell> Ericx5x: Parallex?
[13:55:14] <grizly_> I think it is Parallax
[13:55:56] <Ericx5x> yes parallax was the word i was looking for
[13:55:57] <intellix> I think that effect sucks :P
[13:56:09] <Ericx5x> anyone know a good parallax plugin?
[13:56:13] <intellix> I like the one on Apple's site, where they force you to scroll down a whole page
[13:57:00] <intellix> http://www.apple.com/iphone-5c/ well..... a little parallax in some places :P
[13:59:20] <grizly_> https://plugins.jquery.com/tag/parallax/

[14:29:19] <mrkie> :)
[14:33:02] <nhulea> fuck thanks ok what happens irc stays in irs right ? I dont want to get smacked down
[14:33:21] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha i meant more of people kind of made him feel bad.
[14:33:25] <duch_kazatel> IRC is cooler than that.
[14:33:42] <nhulea> wrd ok I almost emailed 40 people haha
[14:33:50] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[14:34:10] <nhulea> tragedy averted ...
[14:34:19] * nhulea closes email
[14:46:02] <Ownix> this works if ($(this).is("[required=True]"))
[14:46:26] <Ownix> this doesnt if ($(this).attr("required") == "True"))
[14:46:47] <Ownix> why is that? Im inside of an "each" loop is that helps
[14:47:05] <duch_kazatel> what's the doctype?
[14:47:47] <duch_kazatel> also: that's not how you use required.
[14:47:59] <duch_kazatel> console.log($(this).attr("required"));
[14:51:28] <duch_kazatel> Ownix to use required it simply needs to be on the node - <input required>.  however, if you want it to have a value, use something like required="true"
[14:51:53] <duch_kazatel> rather, required="required"
[14:51:55] <duch_kazatel> not true
[14:52:12] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: thats not it. here is the element <li required="True"></li>
[14:52:27] <duch_kazatel> Ownix i'm saying your HTML is invalid.
[14:52:41] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: because im using a custom attribute?
[14:52:54] <duch_kazatel> ah that's not an input. there we go.
[14:53:08] <duch_kazatel> you cannot specify your own attributes like that unless you use data- attributes instead.
[14:53:23] <duch_kazatel> data-required="true" is valid.
[14:53:37] <Ownix> duch_kazatel: ah thank you ill change my code. How do I check them qith jquery?>
[14:53:53] <duch_kazatel> data attributes?  $(this).data('required')
[15:11:27] <ankurk_> And I have work late in the office just because of a silly mistake
[15:11:30] <ankurk_> *to
[15:18:37] <duch_kazatel> yaaaaaay
[15:58:47] <mrkie> i already play a couple of days with several code examples in order to show/hide textareas, can someone here help me to change the text back to 'Show source' when i show the textarea again? http://jsfiddle.net/r5L5C/
[16:03:54] <m1chael> i'm trying to use the autocomplete script (http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/) ... i've got an example set up at: http://infobuzz.me:8005/add-sighting/ # my example that i set up does not work.... my json url is returning proper json, im getting no errors in firefox error console.. can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong?
[16:05:06] <grizly_> mrkie: I'm having a look
[16:10:04] <duch_kazatel> m1chael i'm not seeing the json get called.
[16:11:03] <mrkie> grizly_: thank you for that
[16:13:32] <m1chael> duch_kazatel, right
[16:15:42] <shoky> m1chael: you didn't close the <script src="http://www.infobuzz.me/static/js/typeahead.bundle.js">
[16:16:28] <mrkie> grizly_: can you make it change the text?
[16:16:48] <shoky> mrkie: http://jsfiddle.net/r5L5C/
[16:16:49] <m1chael> shoky, i just added the closed script, same thing
[16:17:22] <shoky> m1chael: not same thing, now getting an error in console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.infobuzz.me:8005/test/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://infobuzz.me:8005' is therefore not allowed access.
[16:17:23] <grizly_> mrkie: done that part, just refining
[16:17:41] <shoky> mrkie oops wrong link  http://jsfiddle.net/r5L5C/1/
[16:17:57] <shoky> and sorry, grizly_ didnt know you were still workin on smth ;p
[16:18:00] <blue_warlock> guys any https expert here ?
[16:18:13] <blue_warlock> i need some advice 5 minutes pls
[16:18:40] <m1chael> shoky, how are you seeing this error?
[16:18:49] <shoky> m1chael: cause i'm using chrome
[16:18:52] <grizly_> shoky, no worries
[16:18:53] <mrkie> grizly_: you changed like all the code :)
[16:19:10] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ blue_warlock
[16:19:11] <b-ot> blue_warlock: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:19:18] <mrkie> grizly_: i was thinking of something like if $("div.container2", $selector).is(':hidden')) { $(this).text('Show source'); } else { $(this).text('Hide source');
[16:19:33] <blue_warlock> its not a question about jquery man
[16:19:43] <mrkie> but that wouldnt work, otherwise i wouldnt ask you :)
[16:19:45] <shoky> mrkie: using a boolean flag is better than depending on .is(':hidden') type stuff
[16:19:57] <duch_kazatel> blue_warlock congrats.  ask the question either way.
[16:19:58] <grizly_> mrkie: aye, but it still doesn't bloody work.. grr
[16:20:00] <blue_warlock> need protocols expert
[16:20:12] <duch_kazatel> then go to a channel about it or ask it.
[16:20:16] <mrkie> grizly_: what doesnt work?
[16:20:45] <grizly_> mrkie: Its not toggling, but you can see where I'm going right?
[16:21:08] <shoky> m1chael: you just need to keep the www.  consistent
[16:21:10] <blue_warlock> i have activated certificate SSL on a website, but i wish to know if it is secure or what is lacking to make it secure or at least to secure the forms....
[16:21:39] <m1chael> shoky, isnt the www consistent though? or is it because of :8005 ?
[16:21:40] <blue_warlock> i had some FB boxes and some other craps but i think they are not secure
[16:21:41] <grizly_> mrkie: now it works.. lol
[16:22:03] <blue_warlock> who can check pls ?
[16:22:05] <shoky> m1chael:  you linked to  infobuzz.me  but your ajax has www.infobuzz.me
[16:22:05] <ognami> herro...
[16:22:38] <m1chael> http://www.infobuzz.me/add-sighting/ # still not working ;/
[16:22:54] <shoky> m1chael: the www.   not the 8805
[16:22:57] <shoky> m1chael: the port was fine
[16:23:21] <shoky> m1chael:  remove the www.
[16:23:23] <mrkie> grizly_: good but i couldt analyse that it didnt toggle before
[16:23:31] <mrkie> couldnt even
[16:23:32] <grizly_> mrkie: http://jsfiddle.net/r5L5C/2/
[16:23:53] <grizly_> yeah, I always screw up the $(this)'s.. fixed now though, should be pretty clear too
[16:24:13] <shoky> m1chael:  or just use  url: '/test/'
[16:24:56] <m1chael> i appreciate your tips.. still not workin ;/
[16:25:13] <shoky> m1chael: yes it's working now
[16:25:17] <mrkie> grizly_: yeah you helped me a lot i see, thnx
[16:25:57] <grizly_> mrkie: I try. ;-)
[16:26:01] <m1chael> shoky, i'm not seeing it work for me in either chrome or firefox
[16:26:03] <shoky> m1chael: well it's loading something with ajax
[16:26:16] <shoky> m1chael  but it's loading this url  http://www.infobuzz.me:8005/accounts/login/?next=/test/
[16:26:20] <m1chael> ohhh
[16:26:25] <m1chael> how are you seeing these errors?
[16:26:43] <ognami> I don't even know how to ask this question :(
[16:26:52] <shoky> m1chael: it's not an error. i'm looking in the network tab
[16:27:04] <shoky> m1chael: and i told you, the first error i saw because i'm using chrome
[16:27:15] <shoky> firefox doesn't say anything about cross-domain issues
[16:27:39] <shoky> m1chael oh sorry, it's loading the right url
[16:27:48] <shoky> m1chael:  and your server is responding with  a 302
[16:28:02] <shoky> m1chael: directing to  http://infobuzz.me:8005/accounts/login/?next=/test/
[16:28:20] <m1chael> ok i fixed the redirect issue...
[16:29:39] <grizly_> mrkie: you don't need those first elements.. thats better
[16:30:02] <m1chael> shoky, what do you think the issue is now? ;/
[16:31:09] <shoky> m1chael: i donno, the first time i tried it after you fixed the redirect, it did load the ajax and i saw the response array . but now im reloading and its not loading that anymore
[16:31:28] <shoky> does that bloodhound thing store stuff in localstorage or smth?
[16:31:47] <grizly_> shoky: BloodHound? The bootstrap code? Yes, yes it does
[16:32:13] <shoky> m1chael: well, the bloodhound stuff worked. now i guess you need to fix something with the typeahead usage, i donno
[16:33:04] <grizly_> I've been working with typeahead recently.. was irritating to get setup first, but now it works brilliantly.. I'm having a look too
[16:33:40] <shoky> oh
[16:33:49] <shoky> m1chael:  you need a DOM ready handler..
[16:34:39] <shoky> around the typeahead stuff. or just stick it at the end of <body> instead
[16:36:18] <fschuindt> Guys there is a way to convert a Date object (in ISO date) into the local js time?
[16:36:52] <m1chael> thanks so much shoky!
[16:37:05] <grizly_> m1chael: he's right, if I copy and paste the typeahead into the console, it works
[16:37:06] <shoky> np m1chael
[16:37:55] <sheilablackrose> hi guys anyone here has exp with plupload?
[16:39:05] <grizly_> fschuindt: try https://github.com/phstc/jquery-dateFormat
[16:39:52] <grizly_> fschuindt: has method toBrowserTimeZone which seems to fit the bill
[16:40:40] <fschuindt> grizly_: cool, thank you
[16:42:26] <grizly_> np
[16:47:21] <sheilablackrose> plupload uploader.refresh(); is not working for ipad, is there any workarounds?
[17:15:14] <duch_kazatel> well this ir boring.
[17:16:09] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: You've solved everyones problems.
[17:16:25] <duch_kazatel> apparently.
[17:16:32] <duch_kazatel> i've made myself obsolete.
[17:16:41] <BillCriswell> It's time to close the channel.
[17:17:08] <duch_kazatel> it was a good run.
[17:19:06] <ISmithers> How does one make a folder 'browsable' so you can load files from it via $.ajax ?
[17:19:25] <duch_kazatel> with a server that scans the directories and shoots back JSON or XML about itl.
[17:20:15] <ISmithers> So jQuery cannot retrieve an array of paths to the files in a directory?
[17:20:19] <duch_kazatel> no.
[17:20:23] <duch_kazatel> jquery is in the browser.
[17:20:31] <duch_kazatel> it has no information about your hard drive.
[17:20:31] <ISmithers> What about this: http://jqfaq.com/how-to-load-all-files-from-directory-using-jquery/ ?
[17:20:51] <duch_kazatel> read that snipped.
[17:20:54] <duch_kazatel> *snippet
[17:20:55] <ISmithers> jQuery can already load files from the harddrive.
[17:20:57] <duch_kazatel> what does it tell you?
[17:21:00] <duch_kazatel> no, it cannot.
[17:21:08] <ISmithers> Yes. It can. I'm doing it right now.
[17:21:10] <duch_kazatel> the server must allow it.
[17:21:22] <duch_kazatel> through a server it can, but not without that server.
[17:21:34] <ISmithers> It's a local webserver.
[17:21:43] <duch_kazatel> correct.  you must at least have a webserver.
[17:21:54] <ISmithers> I thought that part was assumed.
[17:22:08] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: We never assume anything in here.
[17:22:12] <ISmithers> But anyway, now that we have that part clear, how does one read all the paths?
[17:22:29] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: If apache is generating a list of files you can read that and get the urls.
[17:22:42] <duch_kazatel> a recursive function that iterates through everything for you and builds up the list.
[17:22:57] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: If you're using PHP or something you can glob() and use that.
[17:22:59] <duch_kazatel> a smarter idea would be a server-side piece of code that generates the tree for you.
[17:23:09] <BillCriswell> Yesh.
[17:23:36] <BillCriswell> I was just thinking of what already exist for someone to use haha.
[17:27:00] <ISmithers> jQuery already has a get function to load data from a single source, I was hoping for one that does multiples.
[17:27:48] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: You would need to know where the files are before you access them.
[17:28:11] <ISmithers> I know where they are, I have the path, but then I need to load all the files in that path.
[17:28:12] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers you can't recursively get like that.
[17:28:28] <duch_kazatel> right, so after each get, you have to work with your data and move on.
[17:28:34] <duch_kazatel> but that's going to be slooooowwwww
[17:28:47] <duch_kazatel> i assume you're trying to make a tree view?
[17:28:48] <ISmithers> I don't want to manually have to add code for each additional file that appears.
[17:29:00] <duch_kazatel> you're misunderstanding i think.
[17:29:11] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to recursively traverse through your tree.
[17:29:23] <BillCriswell> You can create files.php and put this in there: <?php echo json_encode(glob('images/*.jpg'));
[17:29:24] <duch_kazatel> if if finds a folder, it'll need to queue up a new .get().
[17:29:43] <sheilablackrose> how can i get all elemet with a specific data attribute without using filter
[17:29:55] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: $('[data-foo]')
[17:30:05] <duch_kazatel> sheilablackrose be aware that's slow.
[17:30:40] <sheilablackrose> well im creating a couple instances of an uploader aso i have to find each element that has a data attribute uploader and destroy it
[17:30:44] <sheilablackrose> any other suggestions?
[17:30:50] <ISmithers> If I do $.get("data/somefile.csv", function(csvString){ // do things }) that works fine, for one file that I specifically provide a path for. I want to know how to do that for each file in the 'data' folder.
[17:30:52] <duch_kazatel> add a class to them instead.
[17:31:12] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: You need to something server side.
[17:31:27] <sheilablackrose> so can i do something like $('.myclass').find('data-foo')
[17:31:29] <sheilablackrose> ?
[17:31:31] <sheilablackrose> like that
[17:31:32] <sheilablackrose> ?
[17:31:35] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers by pushing each new folder into a queue of some kind and, on completion, reading off that queue.
[17:31:45] <duch_kazatel> sheilablackrose no, add a class specifically to the items you want to hide.
[17:31:45] <BillCriswell> $('.myclass[data-foo]')
[17:31:56] <sheilablackrose> oh cool thank you guys
[17:32:39] <ISmithers> The issue is more the 'each new file'. How do you detect that? It's weird that jquery can load one file fine, but has nothing that can do it smarter.
[17:33:14] <duch_kazatel> all jquery has in this case is an abstraction for making ajax requests.
[17:33:28] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: files.php = <?php echo header('Content-type: application/json'); json_encode(glob('data/*.csv')); ?>. Then you can read the result of that for new files.
[17:33:40] <duch_kazatel> you really want a server-side solution for this.
[17:33:56] <ISmithers> BillCriswell Ah sorry I saw you mentioned that above.
[17:34:06] <BillCriswell> $.getJSON('files.php', function(data){ console.log(data); });
[17:39:32] <ISmithers> Yeah seems php is the way to go.
[17:39:34] <ISmithers> OK brb
[17:39:46] <BillCriswell> ISmithers: I wouldn't go all that far.
[17:46:40] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Ever conider using coffeescript?
[17:47:19] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:47:31] <duch_kazatel> i like my javascript without ruby all over it :)
[17:48:51] <BillCriswell> scss or sass?
[17:49:04] <felixjet> how i can execute something on a "first li" without any event? (no click, scroll, etc)
[17:49:28] <duch_kazatel> i write scss.
[17:49:34] <duch_kazatel> not the haml inspired syntax.
[17:49:38] <BillCriswell> felixjet: You just want to do something to the first li?
[17:49:44] <felixjet> yes BillCriswell
[17:49:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Right, same here.
[17:49:52] <felixjet> on page load
[17:49:53] <duch_kazatel> and felixjet just write the code inline.
[17:50:05] <felixjet> no inline code
[17:50:10] <felixjet> thats a bad practice
[17:50:18] <duch_kazatel> i mean in a file.
[17:50:24] <duch_kazatel> no need to hook the stuff into an event.
[17:50:34] <felixjet> i know... but how i can make the function?
[17:50:41] <felixjet> like   $('#left li').first().(function() {
[17:50:45] <felixjet> but the correct syntax
[17:50:47] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[17:51:10] <felixjet> ?
[17:51:21] <BillCriswell> felixjet: What do you need to do to the li?
[17:51:59] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/C2pGW/
[17:52:03] <felixjet> BillCriswell execute an ajax call passing its id="" as parameter
[17:52:06] <ISmithers> What do you mean BillCriswell?
[17:52:33] <felixjet> duch_kazatel, i need a function, not css()
[17:52:47] <felixjet> a function wrapper
[17:52:56] <duch_kazatel> you mean an IIFE?
[17:53:16] <duch_kazatel> you can'
[17:53:21] <felixjet> WD IIFE SF?
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> *can't method chain, if that's what you're asking.
[17:53:42] <BillCriswell> felixjet: You would do like $.get('/something', { id: $('li').attr('id') }, doThings);
[17:53:57] <felixjet> BillCriswell, that helps, thx
[17:54:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/C2pGW/2/
[17:54:12] <duch_kazatel> i woulda done something like thios.
[17:54:13] <duch_kazatel> *this
[17:54:14] <BillCriswell> What is WD IIFE SF? lol
[17:54:26] <duch_kazatel> yeah that was confusing.
[17:54:26] <felixjet> "what does IIFE stands for"
[17:54:35] <duch_kazatel> immediately invoked function expression.
[17:54:43] <duch_kazatel> your whole "function wrapper" thing was confusing.
[17:55:05] <BillCriswell> I wonder if we'll eventually stop using words. Holy shit.
[17:55:07] <felixjet> (function(){ <- that ^^ thanks
[17:55:20] <duch_kazatel> (function(){})();
[17:55:23] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want.
[17:55:41] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell seriously i've never seen those abbreviations before.
[17:59:20] <felixjet> it was a joke! :p
[17:59:30] <duch_kazatel> kay
[18:11:20] <duch_kazatel> :( we used $.browser so much in our codebase.
[18:11:26] <duch_kazatel> i'm feeling stabby about it.
[18:11:55] <jphase> sad panda
[18:12:17] <duch_kazatel> why did i ever decide to upgrade us to 1.11
[18:12:29] <jphase> we used a bunch of stuff only 2 years ago that's totally deprecated (php and jquery)
[18:12:35] <jphase> sed ftw!
[18:12:55] <jphase> oh, that wouldn't really work on $.browser though really :\
[18:12:58] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[18:13:05] <jphase> :[
[18:13:09] <duch_kazatel> eeexactly.
[18:13:19] <duch_kazatel> we have one bad use of .toggle() that should be fine.
[18:14:15] <jphase> hmm, I suppose you could do a server-side browser check and set a variable to something like $.browserver hehe
[18:14:21] <jphase> hackeroni
[18:14:21] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[18:14:35] <duch_kazatel> sadly enough we all ready do some browser detection server-side.
[18:14:47] <jphase> well that's just, odd
[18:14:48] <duch_kazatel> just glad i'm not having to touch any of the 1.1 code kicking around.
[18:15:25] <duch_kazatel> heh, our codebase is full of fun like that.
[18:16:49] <ISmithers> Coder just suggested a nice solution which was to append filenames to an intermediate file, and then hardcode that path, and then load the files from that as needed.
[18:17:31] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers that's basically what we were recommending earlier.
[18:17:56] <ISmithers> Was it?
[18:18:05] <duch_kazatel> a server-side based solution, yeah.
[18:18:44] <duch_kazatel> that moves the work to a static file generation mechanism.  i would've done something a little more dynamic but meh.
[18:18:44] <ISmithers> Oh you mean you recommending it by naming the most general thing possible? Of course!
[18:19:13] <duch_kazatel> ISmithers woah dude.  hold up - you were the one trying to use jquery to iterate through a directory stucture served up by whatever webserver you're using.
[18:19:24] <duch_kazatel> we suggested that you look at server-side alternatives.
[18:19:25] <ISmithers> That's a bit like recommending dinner, and then when someone chooses an amazing 5 star restaurant, saying, "That was my idea." :p
[18:19:35] <duch_kazatel> not at all.
[18:19:42] <ISmithers> Yeah, pretty much exactly like that.
[18:20:20] <BillCriswell> ... interesting dude.
[18:20:38] <duch_kazatel> you were the one that tried to criticize jquery for not having some built-in mechanism to iterate through your directory structure for you.
[18:20:42] <duch_kazatel> soooo....
[18:21:09] <ISmithers> Not that I wish to appear ungrateful, but I was looking for something specific as opposed to 'you should write some codes'.
[18:21:32] <ISmithers> Yeah to me it seems weird, I didn't understand why it didn't have it. But I read up and I do now. So that's fine. I'm allowed to ask questions and be critical.
[18:21:44] <duch_kazatel> did you tell us anything about your server side environment?
[18:21:58] <duch_kazatel> it's awfully hard to suggest anything when all I know is you have a server.
[18:22:05] <ISmithers> I tried to, but it's a lot to convey in an imperfect medium, and to be honest I don't know a lot about it myself at this stage.
[18:23:00] <duch_kazatel> huh?  the answer to that question is simple - "I'm running PHP" or "I'm on codeigniter".  or even "i don't know - how would i find out?"
[18:23:44] <BillCriswell> I wish I had like... 3 bagel bites.
[18:23:45] <duch_kazatel> it's like saying "what should i eat for dinner?" and then, when I suggest barbeque, you get offended because you don't eat meat.
[18:24:00] <duch_kazatel> i wish i had a whole 20 bagel bites.
[18:24:04] <duch_kazatel> it's been too long.
[18:24:18] <ISmithers> Anyway! Doesn't matter now.
[18:24:22] <duch_kazatel> anyway, i'm off to home and my new pool system to learn wtf i'm doing with that now.
[18:24:28] <duch_kazatel> i may be on later
[18:24:31] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[18:24:35] <ISmithers> Have a safe trip!
[18:35:30] <TrentonAdams> I have an array containing data for ajax calls that I want to make.  I would like to iterate the loop, and make each ajax call, and then when all of those particular calls are complete, make a different ajax call to complete.  Is there a way I can use jQuery.when() for that?
[18:36:00] <TrentonAdams> brb
[18:38:05] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: You could do like $.when.apply($, arrayOfAjaxCalls).done(function(){ console.log('All done!'); });
[18:40:22] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell, you genious you. :P
[18:40:37] <TrentonAdams> I never even considered that, lol.  DUH!
[18:41:33] <TrentonAdams> Oh, wait, how do you make ajax calls without them actually being called?  i.e. that arrayOfAjaxCalls.
[18:41:36] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: I doubt I thought it up all my own haha. Probably saw it around somewhere.
[18:42:44] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: Not sure I'm following that part.
[18:42:58] <TrentonAdams> Or do I need to?  Should I just push the results of jQuery.ajax() to an array, for each loop?  Then call that when?
[18:44:43] <TrentonAdams> I guess the simple way of saying it is, how do you create arrayOfAjaxCalls?  myAjaxCalls.push(jQuery.ajax()) for each loop iteration?
[18:44:56] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: Yes.
[18:44:57] <sheilablackrose> hi guys when i do $('#Myelem').data('uploader') i get values but when i do $('#Myelem[uploader]') i dont get anything
[18:45:22] <sheilablackrose> can anyone tell me what i'm doing wrong
[18:45:55] <TrentonAdams> Oh, dumb question.  jQuery can't care about whether the calls are done before the entry to when().  when() is simply using those references to check for whether they are finished.
[18:46:44] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: Just because the data is set doesn't mean it has the data attribute. You would need to do like $('.somethingToNarrowItDown').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('uploader'); });
[18:47:18] <sheilablackrose> is there away to do it without using filter?
[18:47:26] <sheilablackrose> filter is not supported in the old i.e right
[18:47:43] <BillCriswell> sheilablackrose: That's jQuery's filter, not Array.prototype.filter
[18:47:50] <BillCriswell> So it's cool to use for old IE.
[18:48:10] <sheilablackrose> oh ok thank you
[18:48:40] <sheilablackrose> it works :)
[18:48:44] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: Yes, then when they're all done you can do .done(doSomething)
[18:49:04] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: Yeah, very cool.  Thanks for the help
[18:49:15] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[18:57:14] <jphase> I'm a bit confused on the proper way to use the callbacks stack within my plugin. I need to bind a custom event handler like .on('save' and let the user add things onto that event. The test page for my plugin is here http://robido.com/wysiwyg/  and the plugin itself is here https://github.com/jphase/wysiwyg/blob/master/js/wysiwyg.js - at first I started by having events as an object in my options but now I'm trying to rewrite it to be semantic a
[18:57:14] <jphase> nd sexypants. Could use a jQuery nerd's help on any suggestions of how to rewrite things.
[19:06:32] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: It seems that done() is called every time something from the arrayOfAjaxCalls completes, is that right?  I wanted a function to be run after all of them are complete, not for each one
[19:06:51] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: That doesn't sound right.
[19:07:12] <TrentonAdams> it.
[19:07:21] <TrentonAdams> Hmm, looking at it.
[19:09:09] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: Oh, I had forgotten that my series of calls was more complex.
[19:09:18] <TrentonAdams> I need to do further wrapping. :(
[19:09:28] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: Sounds like a blast haha
[19:09:51] <TrentonAdams> not really.  :(  The ajax API I'm using is a pain in the rear.
[19:10:19] <TrentonAdams> I don't think it allows me to pass multiple ids, I have to make one call at a time.  I'm going to verify that now though, cause maybe I'm crazy. :P
[19:19:42] <BillCriswell> Finally found a nice little way to grab some sample JSON.
[19:22:52] <TrentonAdams> How?
[19:25:06] <BillCriswell> api.github.com/user/foo
[19:25:19] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/ETHA5/1/ set up this test to make sure I was thinking about things right.
[19:25:22] <jtcwang> Heyo ppl, I've just upgraded to jquery mobile 1.4
[19:25:30] <hlve> Nice.
[19:25:45] <jtcwang> but i'm having problem creating buttons programmatically
[19:25:48] <jtcwang> with li elements
[19:26:04] <jtcwang> but if its using <li data-role="button"> its fine
[19:26:21] <hlve> jtcwang, jsfiddle?
[19:26:33] <jtcwang> jsfiddle doesn't have 1.4 unfortunately..
[19:26:42] <jtcwang> it got 1.2
[19:27:20] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/59XDP/ has it loaded with 1.4
[19:27:42] <hlve> ^^
[19:27:47] <hlve> and what's wrong with using data-role? that's the norm
[19:28:08] <jtcwang> because i needed to create the element based on some programme logic
[19:28:44] <hlve> why would it having a data-role prevent you from doing that lol
[19:29:15] <jtcwang> nono, what's happening is if i created the button programmatically using $('.liement').button()
[19:29:18] <jtcwang> it wraps it in a div
[19:29:34] <jtcwang> i'll play around in jsfiddle
[19:29:48] <hlve> i'd have to see the code :^
[19:37:12] <d3m0n> What am I doing wrong here? I am looking at the targeted element in firebug and see some action but no toggling of the class - http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mIpuo
[19:42:06] <shoky> d3m0n: 2 click events are being triggered
[19:43:37] <d3m0n> shoky: How's that? The first div is the only element with the class .switch?
[19:44:19] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: Okay, that is pretty nice.  So the done function is called with the "page" result for each call in the order they were made?
[19:46:00] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: Yes.
[19:46:05] <shoky> d3m0n: well not 2 click events, but the click is propagated up twice to the .switch element
[19:46:15] <shoky> d3m0n: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mqiLa  fixes it
[19:46:37] <BillCriswell> Can't imagine when you'd need to do that, but yes.
[19:47:16] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: But that's not documented, so should we be using that?
[19:47:25] <d3m0n> shoky: I won't be able to use an ID because I want this to work for multple On/Off switches, is that possible?
[19:47:44] <shoky> d3m0n: sure, use a class
[19:47:51] <BillCriswell> TrentonAdams: https://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[19:48:12] <d3m0n> shoky: Can I ask how/why is propagting twice?
[19:49:03] <shoky> d3m0n: it's being triggered both on the checkbox and on the divs inside the label, and propagating up from both
[19:49:38] <d3m0n> shoky: Since it's the selector is attached to the parent div?
[19:49:46] <d3m0n> Since the selector*
[19:49:59] <TrentonAdams> BillCriswell: It shows having multiple done functions, but I don't see any examples indicating multiple parameter done functions.
[19:50:12] <shoky> d3m0n: yeah. it catches events that bubble up from descendant elements
[19:51:13] <d3m0n> Thanks for clearing that up shoky, makes sense.
[19:51:18] <shoky> d3m0n: the way to see which is to console.log(e.target)  in the click handler. where e is the event argument passed to the click handler e.g.  .click(function(e) { ... })
[19:51:20] <d3m0n> And the fix
[19:51:24] <shoky> np
[19:54:09] <shoky> TrentonAdams: the .done callback just has as arguments whatever the deffered was .resolve'd with.  $.when creates a new deferred and resolves it with the multiple arguments (from each separate promise)
[19:55:24] <shoky> TrentonAdams: and it's not in the order they were made, it's in the order that you passed them to $.when
[19:56:40] <sheilablackrose> im doing on document register the mouseenter function for the classes. the problem is if i update the section with ajax how can i register the mouseenter without re registering the ones that are originally registered? http://jsfiddle.net/TAFgL/2/
[19:57:04] <sheilablackrose> sorry this one http://jsfiddle.net/TAFgL/3/
[19:58:04] <shoky> sheilablackrose: with event delegation, using .on   e.g.  $('.main').on('mouseenter', '.trigger', function...)
[19:58:27] <shoky> (and you just run that once on doc ready, and forget about it)
[19:59:22] <sheilablackrose> shoky yeha i did that but the problem is when i call a different view i would have to re run the on again but if i do it again some will have like a double bind on it
[19:59:37] <shoky> don't call it again.
[20:00:06] <sheilablackrose> i have to the new section that is loaded via ajax is not bind
[20:00:52] <shoky> what are you arguing for :\
[20:01:51] <sheilablackrose> meaning like just say when loaded it binds 10 elements right. but when i load another 20 via ajax the extra 10 is not bound. but if i run the bind again the original 10 would have like a double bind to it
[20:02:03] <shoky> that's why you should use event delegation
[20:02:05] <sheilablackrose> is there away to get the element by class that is not bound n only bind them
[20:02:20] <sheilablackrose> could u explain abit more
[20:02:30] <sheilablackrose> or some helpful links
[20:02:40] <shoky> just use event delegation. bind once on page load (when .main already exists) and don't bind again
[20:02:43] <shoky> and it should work
[20:02:51] <shoky> `api on
[20:02:52] <b-ot> shoky: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[20:03:02] <shoky> that's a very helpful link, has a whole section about event delegation
[20:03:08] <sheilablackrose> thank you
[20:03:45] <shoky> .main will wait for mouseenter events to bubble up from ANY .trigger elements inside it
[20:03:55] <shoky> whether those .trigger elements exist on page load or not
[20:04:59] <sheilablackrose> .main ?
[20:05:11] <shoky> <div class="main">
[20:05:15] <shoky> if you do:  $('.main').on('mouseenter', '.trigger', function...)
[20:05:56] <sheilablackrose> so in side the div if i create new elements viw ajax n it has .trigger it would work
[20:05:56] <sheilablackrose> ?
[20:06:02] <shoky> yes
[20:06:06] <sheilablackrose> awesome!!!
[20:06:09] <sheilablackrose> let me test that :)
[20:06:10] <shoky> ;p
[20:06:38] <sheilablackrose> im guessing its the same for click as well right
[20:06:47] <shoky> as long as you don't replace that .main div or its parents
[20:06:54] <shoky> yeah same for click
[20:07:42] <sheilablackrose> thanks thats really useful
[20:08:12] <shoky> indeed
[20:15:23] <jtcwang> heyo, here's the fiddle, hlve :)
[20:16:10] <hlve> ^^
[20:16:16] * hlve looks
[20:16:46] <jtcwang> http://jsfiddle.net/59XDP/20/
[20:16:49] <ad0ran> hello
[20:16:50] <jtcwang> omg
[20:16:57] <jtcwang> too tired
[20:17:08] <hlve> lol
[20:17:22] <jtcwang> so u can see that the li i added programmatically is wrapped in div
[20:17:37] <jtcwang> hmm actually give me a sec
[20:17:39] <jtcwang> i want to try something
[20:17:43] <ad0ran> can anyone help me with extending jquery-ui 1.10 widgets?
[20:18:15] <ad0ran> i'm trying to follow the official docs, but it keeps throwing out errors
[20:23:24] <BillCriswell> Yeoman seems... a bit much?
[20:26:35] <jtcwang> hlve: as seen here: http://jsfiddle.net/59XDP/21/, it is creating a div element around it
[20:26:42] <jtcwang> is there a ways to stop it from doing so?
[20:27:41] <indranil> hi, I'm writing a little plugin, and I'd like to let users edit/add options to it after initialisation of the plugin. I've seen plugins use $el.pluginName('option', val); is there any good documentation source I can read up on to implement this on my plugin?
[20:29:22] <hlve> sec jtcwang
[20:32:58] <juxta> I'm working with jquery and jquery mobile, wanting some advice on the way I am doing something. I have a jqm navbar, which I wish to edit the contents of. at the moment I am building a blob of HTML <li>'s, then replacing the contents of a container div around the navbar, calling .trigger("create"). is there a better way to do this?
[20:33:36] <hlve> jtcwang :: http://jsfiddle.net/59XDP/24/
[20:33:38] <hlve> That work for you?
[20:33:40] <hlve> ;o
[20:33:42] <jphase> indranil: you'll want to have a default options object that you extend with options passed using $.extend
[20:34:05] <hlve> Just added an unwrap to the element within the function. This will remove the div wrapping.
[20:34:07] <hlve> ^^
[20:35:40] <jtcwang> hlve, ahh, my bad js skill shows
[20:35:47] <jtcwang> cheers man, really appreciate it
[20:35:56] <hlve> ;P Meh. Merely just a quick fix. Hope it helps!
[20:35:59] <indranil> jphase: using something like this: http://pastie.org/8863885
[20:36:40] <juxta> I'd like to find a neater way of doign what I'm doing so that I can attach a .click function to the elements i'm working with, without searching for/selecting them again
[20:38:12] <indranil> but logging base.options gives me undefined.. base returns the object I saved to the data
[20:38:52] <terriblesarcasm> On a successful AJAX call, how would I load a new page without disrupting the navbar. As in, I don't want to reload the entire page, but just the inner div that is navigated normally by the navbar?
[20:39:34] <sadtaco> Is there a limit to how much I can $.getScript()?  I'm doing it in a loop and it stops at 4 every single time, even though the 4th file's GET returns sucessfully in my console it doesn't complete the callback in the $.getScript()
[20:39:46] <jphase> indranil: in its basic form:   http://jsfiddle.net/5qZAL/
[20:40:42] <jphase> indranil: bah sorry, should be like this:  http://jsfiddle.net/5qZAL/1/
[20:41:26] <indranil> jphase: that works fine... but say I want to allow users to edit the configuration set while initialising.. for example, on clicking a colour, maybe run a $el.pluginName('foo', 'bar');
[20:41:55] <jphase> yeah, that'd be doable with that example I gave you. notice at the bottom foo: 'notbar' is passed
[20:42:17] <jphase> which makes console.log show up with the value passed. If you don't pass that value, "bar" is passed rather than "notbar"
[20:42:36] <indranil> ok
[20:42:41] <indranil> I'll try that
[20:44:18] <terriblesarcasm> My home.php page has the page createPlaylist loaded into the #content div by $(#content).load(createPlaylist.php), so within that createPlaylist.php how would I navigate to viewPlaylist.php, without disrupting the home.php that's currently loaded? Which part of the DOM do I want to load, would it be $(document) of the createPlaylist page?
[20:46:47] <sadtaco> Okay I see the problem
[20:46:52] <jphase> terriblesarcasm: by navigate to it it sounds like you're expecting that loaded content to act similar to an iframe. when you load content with .load it literally appends content from that source onto the page, so if you click on a link within that loaded content, the entire page will navigate to that link.
[20:47:34] <sadtaco> I'm using $.getScript() to load one script, and after that loading a script that depends on the original script (calls its namespace).  How do I have getScript() scripts to be loaded in as if they were in the header as a script tag?
[20:47:45] <terriblesarcasm> jphase: So then there is no way within that page to not disrupt the home.php?
[20:48:29] <jphase> terriblesarcasm: I mean, you could bind events to anchor tags on the loaded content after it loads so it then calls another .load call within that container, but at this point I'd ask why not just use an iframe instead of recreating an iframe with jQuery?
[20:50:04] <terriblesarcasm> jphase: well I plan to migrate to angular and routes, I just wanted this one thing done to show someone for tomorrow, before I have time to migrate
[20:50:41] <jphase> terriblesarcasm: if I'm understanding your purpose correctly, it sounds like it'd be easiest to just use an iframe.
[20:50:52] <jphase> that's sorta what they're for
[20:51:01] <terriblesarcasm> Damn
[20:51:24] <sadtaco> How do I use $.getScript() and have things placed into global scope from the loaded scripts?
[20:51:27] <terriblesarcasm> Or wait, so that would really just consist of me changing the div to an iframe.. hmm not too bad
[20:52:17] <jphase> terriblesarcasm: exactly, and then just style it to not look like an iframe (i.e. take away the borders, make the content adjust the height, etc.) and then all your links won't effect the entire page, just that iframe container.
[20:53:01] <jphase> sadtaco: initialize an empty variable before your $.getScript calls, set the variable within the finishing function
[20:53:16] <sadtaco> Eh..
[20:53:51] <sadtaco> But I'm trying to load things like THREE.js that sets a global THREE variable.  I have to manually set such a variable, for everything that sets global variables?
[20:54:21] <jphase> oh, no if it's in the script you're loading it should load into the namespace in which the getScript call happens
[20:54:26] <jphase> or within the scope rather
[20:55:34] <sadtaco> This is annoying. I'll try appending <script> tags I guess
[20:57:51] <sadtaco> Well it appended them but I still get the error of THREE not being defined :/
[21:02:17] <sadtaco> How can I have getScripts load inside of each other, with an unknown amount?
[21:02:22] <sadtaco> I have an array of all the scripts to load
[21:02:52] <sadtaco> I was doing a recursive function like..  loadScript(){ $.getScript(... function(){ loadScript() } }
[21:03:33] <jphase> $.each(scripts, function(index, value){ $.getScript(value, function(data){ // when script is loaded }); });
[21:03:53] <jphase> that won't wait for each one to finish though
[21:07:05] <sadtaco> no that doesn't work
[21:07:12] <sadtaco> They won't be inside each others scope
[21:08:32] <sadtaco> They need to be nested
[21:09:36] <sadtaco> omg
[21:09:41] <sadtaco> loading one inside another doesn't work either wtf
[21:09:42] <sadtaco> this is stupid
[21:11:42] <CorySimmons> Is it possible to get a CSS property's value if the property isn't real?
[21:12:03] <CorySimmons> For instance: console.log($('aside').css('monkey-butler')); returns undefined
[21:12:32] <CorySimmons> But in my css:  aside { monkey-butler: good; }
[21:12:43] <CorySimmons> I'd expect jQuery to return 'good'
[21:12:55] <shoky> no.
[21:13:19] <CorySimmons> Possible in vanilla js?
[21:13:46] <shoky> only by parsing the actual css.. i think
[21:14:30] <sadtaco> Sigh. How about this. How can I catch and errors of a script not loading when it's in a script tag in the page's head, WITHOUT manually checking if namespaces exist?
[21:15:33] <CorySimmons> shoky: Thanks
[21:18:06] <sadtaco> Why does appending a <script> element with the scripts content not add something to global namespace?
[21:18:20] <sadtaco> well maybei t does
[21:19:02] <guideX> is there something like the apple ios folder view with the unique treeview thingy but in jquery
[21:19:12] <guideX> or javascript
[21:19:20] <guideX> or should I just make something..
[21:20:15] <ISmithers> Is there a $ command to get a  column of data from a csv?
[21:20:39] <ISmithers> So my csv has names, address, email, and I want all the names in an array say.
[21:22:24] <sadtaco> string.split()?
[21:28:07] <sheilablackrose> see ya guys have a nice day
[21:32:20] <axilaris> hi...you guys know any nice simple example for dynamic forms adding and removing... having so much trouble with doing this...
[21:33:11] <axilaris> ok so easy found it
[21:33:11] <axilaris> http://jsfiddle.net/jaredwilli/tZPg4/4/
[21:33:15] <axilaris> hope this is good one
[21:33:25] <pjppj> if something is called to react on mouseover where is that call kept? Jquery.js? The Html or CSS Code? or some other JS File?
[21:35:35] <Whirl3d> in jquery UI how can I restrict to both axes only?
[21:36:03] <Whirl3d> sorry, in draggable()
[21:36:41] <Whirl3d> I can restrict using $(el).draggable({revert:true, axis:'x'}), but can't get it to restrict to x or y
[21:38:20] <Whirl3d> Should I capture the mousedown() event, set a small delay to check x,y position and then apply draggable to the axis where x or y is greatest?
[21:42:13] * blue_warlock gnight all
[21:55:12] <Whirl3d> anybody here>
[21:55:39] <Whirl3d> wow, this has got to be first.

[22:01:39] <Uhkis> never heard
[22:02:28] <Whirl3d> It's a 4x4 card game where al the cards are either a '1', '2', or some other number that's hard to describe
[22:02:56] <Uhkis> some iphone crap :-)
[22:03:27] <Whirl3d> if you drag a '1' card onto a '2' card, the dropped position becomes a 3 same the other way around basically
[22:04:13] <Whirl3d> if two cards 3 or greater are the same, they can be added together in the same manner. So you get 3's 6's 12's, 24's etc. etc.
[22:05:00] <Whirl3d> The trick is that when you drag one card (say the 1 onto the 2 vertically upwards), all of the possible cards that could be moved up will move at the same time.
[22:05:56] <Whirl3d> So first question is how do I use .draggable() to restrict to either or both axes?
[22:07:06] <shoky> Whirl3d: your idea with the greatest x/y is good
[22:07:16] <shoky> no need for a delay though
[22:07:28] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/B4uNP/
[22:08:17] <shoky> of course, it doesn't let you change axis without letting go first
[22:08:53] <Whirl3d> wow. that's perfect.
[22:09:36] <shoky> your idea ;P
[22:10:04] <Whirl3d> I just realized that the entire board responds to the drag event. (though the game makes you think it's just the card you are dragging--it's the whole board)
[22:10:27] <Whirl3d> so is there a fancy way to evaluate which cards can combine without having to cycle through all of them?
[22:11:51] <shoky> didn't really understand the game
[22:16:00] <Whirl3d> Every time the board is dragged upwards, I have to start at R2C1 and compare it's value to R1C1 ( if (a.data("val")+b.data("val")==3||a.data('val')==b.data("val")) then a can be combined with B so the board can be moved up
[22:16:53] <Whirl3d> BUt I have to do this for C1-C4 for each row R2 -R4...maybe there's a cuter way to do it.
[22:17:04] <shoky> sorry, totally lost me ;p
[22:17:18] <Whirl3d> gimme a second...I'll do a fiddle the ugly way..
[22:21:03] <Uhkis> Whirl3d: i'm gonna go ahead and say you will have to iterate through everything. doubt there is some magical way to do this
[22:26:36] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CAjUU/4/
[22:27:18] <Whirl3d> This is just to show the table and the drag function (though I have some work to do on the drag function as well)
[22:27:55] <Whirl3d> If I drag a 1 onto a 2 or a 2 onto a 1, a new 3 card should appear where the card was dropped
[22:32:53] <shoky> can't play it online or on android? phooey
[22:33:28] <shoky> i see android has fives :S
[22:34:55] <shoky> Whirl3d yea judging from the little i can understand about the gameplay, i'd have to agree with Ukhis
[22:35:55] <shoky> might be little tricks to optimize finding the cards.. but with such a small board it really doesn't matter
[22:36:28] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CAjUU/7/
[22:36:36] <Whirl3d> Drag a 1 onto a 2
[22:40:12] <shoky> it did some stuff yay
[22:42:15] <Whirl3d> lol.
[22:42:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/CAjUU/10/
[22:42:41] <Whirl3d> Now, it updates the card. Next it will create a new random card to replace the dragged card.
[22:45:04] <shoky> you can just use  ui.draggable btw
[22:45:26] <shoky> don't need that dragging class
[22:48:49] <Whirl3d> cool
[22:52:29] <pjppj> more like gayquery
[22:52:31] <pjppj> HEH
[22:53:12] <Whirl3d> so, how do you address the item being dropped onto a droppable from within the droppable handle
[22:58:46] <jphase> pjppj: stfu
[22:58:51] <jphase> lol
[23:02:27] <Whirl3d> How do you enable/disable droppable?
[23:04:10] <axilaris> hi... can someone help me out... http://jsfiddle.net/5B4L5/1/ how can i fix my removetag to remove properly
[23:06:07] <jphase> axilaris: are you just wanting the #removeTag itself to remove or?
[23:08:43] <jphase> axilaris: oic, you're having issues with newly added elements it looks like
[23:10:34] <jphase> axilaris: http://jsfiddle.net/5B4L5/3/
[23:10:37] <axilaris> jphase: yes... not sure why the removetag is working properly
[23:10:43] <axilaris> thanks jphase!
[23:10:45] <axilaris> let me check
[23:12:41] <axilaris> jphase: why it didnt work at first ? $("#removeTag").click(function()
[23:13:12] <axilaris> why does it have to have the document click statement like you suggested ? $(document).on("click", "#removeTag", function()
[23:13:54] <jphase> axilaris: because at the time that runs, only 1 #removeTag is present. By binding to the document and passing a child selector, you can ensure that all dynamically created elements that are created afterwards also trigger the event since it's technically bound to the entire document
[23:14:55] <axilaris> thanks jphase
[23:15:06] <jphase> sure
[23:27:00] <Cork> axilaris: also your html is invalid
[23:27:11] <Cork> axilaris: you arn't allowed to have multiple elements with the same id
[23:27:22] <Cork> i suggest using a class instead of id
[23:28:03] <axilaris> Cork: actually, im trying to figure out how to create multiple elements with different ids
[23:28:10] <axilaris> thanks for your comments Cork...
[23:28:31] <Cork> axilaris: well based on how the example looks, a class looks like the solution you want
[23:31:02] <axilaris> Cork: ok... im actually programming on rails... it takes id for somethign... not sure about class
[23:31:20] <Cork> axilaris: just pass it to the option section
[23:31:25] <Cork> { class: "" }
[23:32:10] <Cork> the input fields should still have an id
[23:32:18] <Cork> so you need to add a number there
[23:32:25] <Cork> but the buttons and the like don't need it
[23:32:38] <Cork> and you should remove it there
[23:33:31] <ns5> To select all lis of <li class="vacation america">, why should I use $(".america")?  why not $(".vacation america")?
[23:33:38] <fabioportieri> good morning
[23:33:52] <Cork> ns5: dot instead of the space
[23:34:07] <ns5> Cork: is dot a wildcard here?
[23:34:12] <Cork> no
[23:34:21] <Cork> class="vacation america" is two class names
[23:34:34] <ns5> Cork: ?
[23:34:40] <axilaris> Cork: ok thanks... i'll check it out
[23:34:40] <Cork> $(".vacation.america") will select all elements with both classes in any order
[23:34:41] <ns5> class names can't contain spaces?
[23:34:49] <Cork> no
[23:34:56] <Cork> then you have two classes
[23:35:02] <Cork> space is a separator
[23:35:11] <Cork> though you can use two class names
[23:35:17] <Cork> it doesn't really affect anything
[23:35:21] <Cork> *effect
[23:35:34] <dismist> if the class name is identical than technically yes
[23:35:47] <Cork> dismist: identical?
[23:36:04] <ns5> where can I learn the syntax of html class
[23:36:06] <dismist> though it would be errant/redundant to place duplicate class names on a single element
[23:36:08] <Cork> $(".vacation.america")  will match  <li class="vacation america"> and <li class="america vacation">
[23:36:21] <Cork> and <li class="vacation something-else america">
[23:36:22] <Cork> and so on

[23:36:50] <b-ot> Cork: Selectors - Web developer guide | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network â https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[23:36:55] <dismist> pop quiz: does $('.america.america.america')  act as a selector for <img class="america"> ?
[23:37:09] <Cork> no
[23:37:18] <ns5> where can I learn the syntax of html class
[23:37:19] <Cork> opps
[23:37:22] <dismist> how about <img class="america america america">
[23:37:25] <Cork> missed what you have in the selector
[23:37:43] <Cork> hmm
[23:37:51] <Cork> actually $('.america.america.america') should match <img class="america">
[23:37:56] <dismist> yes it should
[23:38:07] <dismist> ;)
[23:38:36] <Whirl3d> when calling the .droppable() method on an element, how do I access the item being dropped on it?
[23:38:53] <Cork> dismist: and it is a working selector
[23:38:59] <Cork> dismist: http://jsfiddle.net/sj4vN/
[23:39:01] <dismist> thank you for confirming
[23:39:10] <dismist> i was very interested but too lazy to fiddle it
[23:39:14] <Cork> so again i don't understand what you mean by identical
[23:39:20] <dismist> just that
[23:39:37] <Cork> but they don't need to be identical
[23:39:42] <dismist> no no
[23:39:49] <Cork> all the classes you chain in the selector needs to be on the element
[23:39:54] <Cork> there is no need for it to be identical
[23:40:01] <dismist> of course not
[23:40:03] <dismist> its not practical
[23:40:07] <Cork> ...
[23:40:30] <Cork> your directly contradicting your self right now...
[23:40:34] <dismist> but its nice to explore the boundaries and logic of a framework to fully understand it from the inside out, no?
[23:40:51] <Cork> i know fully well how css selectors work...
[23:40:57] <Cork> *know
[23:41:24] <dismist> hey come on with the finalities
[23:42:43] <axilaris> Cork: i think the js seems to be what i need.. http://jsfiddle.net/5B4L5/2/, still havent figured out your classes suggestion... but upon submit.. post params looks good for me to process in Rails
[23:42:43] <axilaris> Parameters: {"utf8"=>"â", "authenticity_token"=>"Hr5pNPKdH6SSFu4AQ5F8UwdCxwGjk0J4k7mirfMeYmc=", "payment_account"=>{"name"=>"", "data"=>""}, "tags"=>["h", "b", ""], "weights"=>["1", "2", ""], "commit"=>"Create Payment account"}
[23:42:50] <Whirl3d> the demo for jquery-ui in the api  is a complete joke. Even the demos at jquery-ui.com fail to explain how to determine the object dropped on a droppable.
[23:42:53] <dismist> axilaris: no prob
[23:43:08] <axilaris> only one issue, notice tags and weights... how can i remove the last item which is empty
[23:43:19] <Cork> axilaris: no that won't work as the id will only match the first element with the id
[23:43:24] <axilaris> i think the reason maybe the hidden field
[23:43:30] <dismist> :last-child
[23:43:34] <dismist> isnt it?
[23:43:35] <Cork> axilaris: all the other elements will be invalid
[23:43:50] <dismist> invalid... whats with all the negative energy tonight cork
[23:44:23] <axilaris> Cork: it seems to be just appending the elements into the array
[23:44:30] <axilaris> why do u say its invalid ?
[23:44:45] <Cork> axilaris: cause it is
[23:44:50] <dismist> hey cork
[23:44:53] <dismist> takes it easy he has a point
[23:44:53] <axilaris> in the above example.. i added 2 fields
[23:45:05] <Cork> axilaris: browsers has a hash table
[23:45:12] <axilaris> it did append into the array
[23:45:14] <Cork> in that hash table it uses the id from the element to identify it
[23:45:20] <Cork> if you have two elements with the same id
[23:45:27] <Cork> the second element won't be targetable by the id
[23:45:29] <dismist> axil dont waste your time with doubters man... their sole mission is dream busting
[23:45:32] <axilaris> well... im trying out actually from this solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17839147/dynamically-add-fields-in-rails-with-out-nested-attributes
[23:45:36] <Cork> cause it isn't valid to have two elements with the same id
[23:46:00] <fabioportieri> dismist: what?
[23:46:04] <Cork> dismist: please stop spreading disinformation
[23:46:20] <axilaris> Cork: hmm... ok... is something wrong with the params im getting ?
[23:46:44] <Guest62626> have a few questions about an issue i'm having with jquery.. wondering if i may get some advice here.  any takers?
[23:46:45] <Cork> axilaris: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffiddle.jshell.net%2FAsbJ6%2Fshow%2F&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[23:47:02] <Cork> axilaris: the removeTag can't be used like that
[23:47:21] <Cork> it isn't valid and it wont work in standard complient browsers
[23:47:21] <dismist> hey sorry fabio wasnt trying to offend. i just see a young up and coming web mogul just trying to do his thing (albeit in a non-conventional manner) and constantly having the wind taken from his sails
[23:47:46] <dismist> i want to make sure our successors are ready when it comes time to grab that torch
[23:47:50] <Cork> dismist: i'm not trying to take his wind
[23:48:04] <Cork> but if he is to make a successful page he needs to know the standards
[23:48:10] <axilaris> dismist: :) anyway... im by no means near what u think i would be in the future
[23:48:13] <dismist> standards shmandards
[23:48:17] <Cork> else he will just sit and bang at things that doesn't work
[23:48:24] <Guest62626> is it possible to modify this so that it excludes one particular text field by class or id? var _inputs = jQuery('input[type="text"],input[type="password"],textarea');
[23:48:28] <dismist> hes not coming off as a banger to me
[23:48:37] <dismist> more of an introverted intellectual
[23:48:42] <axilaris> Cork: then what you are saying this solution is "not" quite right http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17839147/dynamically-add-fields-in-rails-with-out-nested-attributes
[23:48:44] <Cork> dismist: standards is VERY important, else we will be back at quirk mode
[23:48:51] <dismist> with his own ideology of how things should be done
[23:49:10] <dismist> tell that to alexander the great, who made a career of defying standards
[23:49:14] <axilaris> the standards somehow is not complied all the time
[23:49:17] <axilaris> like in this case
[23:49:19] <Cork> dismist: they update the id to be unique
[23:49:24] <Cork> dismist: and that is valid
[23:49:37] <Cork> dismist: but then you need to repeate all the ids in the selecto (line 7)
[23:49:40] <Cork> opps
[23:49:42] <dismist> good point
[23:49:43] <Cork> wrong nick
[23:49:50] <Cork> axilaris: ^
[23:49:50] <dismist> no no.. dismist is fine
[23:50:03] <Cork> axilaris: so instead you give all those elements a class
[23:50:07] <Cork> select based on that class
[23:50:07] <axilaris> let me try with unique ids...there are few examples on the net
[23:50:14] <Cork> and no mater how many elements you add it will work
[23:50:22] <Cork> axilaris: your missing the point...
[23:50:23] <dismist> but if im hearing you right, about the selecto(r?) in line 7, we need to repeat id's?  repeating id's is not possible because only one id per page is permitted
[23:50:24] <dismist> no?
[23:50:29] <Cork> the point is: use a class
[23:50:57] <Cork> axilaris: http://jsfiddle.net/5B4L5/4/
[23:51:01] <dismist> if i offered u a coin that was one of a kind, vs a similar coin that was 1 in 3 million
[23:51:02] <axilaris> unique class with same ids, validator will still fail right ?
[23:51:05] <dismist> which would u be more inclined to take
[23:51:27] <Cork> axilaris: the ids needs to be updated if you really need them
[23:51:36] <dismist> update id's on the fly???
[23:51:40] <Cork> axilaris: but you don't need to add ids to elements unless you need them
[23:51:58] <dismist> what the FUCK!
[23:52:06] <Cork> axilaris: the only id i argue about right now is the removeTag id
[23:52:16] <Cork> it SHOULD be a class instead
[23:52:29] <axilaris> Cork: what did you change ? dont see any changes
[23:52:44] <Cork> axilaris: id="removeTag" => class="removeTags"
[23:52:44] <axilaris> ah
[23:52:46] <axilaris> ok
[23:52:55] <axilaris> i thought the fields id
[23:53:01] <Cork> and #removeTag => .removeTag
[23:53:09] <Cork> axilaris: form elements should always have ids
[23:53:11] <axilaris> ok that should still work with the solution
[23:53:15] <Cork> and ya you need to dynamically update them
[23:53:21] <dismist> axil lemme run a quick scan on that for any type of malware/trojan before u execute that in your code
[23:53:34] <Cork> O_o
[23:53:48] <dismist> clean
[23:53:53] <axilaris> haha
[23:54:28] <Cork> dismist: if you want to help ppl, you should help them to make better pages
[23:54:38] <axilaris> dismist: u r in your now :)
[23:54:43] <axilaris> u r in your zone
[23:54:45] <axilaris> :)
[23:54:46] <Cork> not derail them
[23:55:02] <dismist> if i wanted to be a shepherd i would treat all those thirsty for knowledge as if they were sheep
[23:55:31] <Cork> dismist: then please don't answer there questions or comment on ppl helping them
[23:55:39] <dismist> i just want to fit in with the rest of the room, sit down and be one of the crew
[23:55:43] <Cork> you are making this hard and messy for no good reason
[23:55:53] <axilaris> Cork: how about addNewTag ? do i need to put it in a class too ?
[23:55:57] <Cork> dismist: then try to help instead of make this harder
[23:55:57] <dismist> your mothe............ cant do it
[23:56:06] <axilaris> probably not... only one instance of it
[23:56:09] <Cork> axilaris: no you only have one
[23:56:12] <Cork> and you never clone it
[23:56:44] <dismist> cork u ever wonder what it would be like to have a clone
[23:56:50] <Cork> ...
[23:57:19] <axilaris> got another question... if say i want to prefill 2 item entries... can i pass parameter into $("#skillSet").append($("#new_skills_form").html());
[23:57:33] <axilaris> and fill text field entry ?
[23:57:37] <dismist> or like a shit talking version fo yourself who's stats were slightly higher than yours in vernacular and physical prowess
[23:57:47] <Cork> axilaris: actaully the .html() part isn't really right either
[23:57:55] <axilaris> damn it
[23:57:56] <Cork> axilaris: one min let me help you clean that part up a bit
[23:57:56] <axilaris> ok
[23:58:16] <dismist> so the only way u could really kick his ass would be through the use of performance enhancing drugs or program a bot to destroy him
[23:58:56] <dismist> id opt for the bot... ive heard all the good PEDs are injected intravenously and im afraid of needles
