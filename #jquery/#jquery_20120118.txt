[00:02:57] <anli_> Is there a way to declare that if index.php has been modified, then all the files that index.php uses should be discarded from the cache?
[00:03:27] <anli_> Hm, more of a css question
[00:04:29] <Ortund> kawohi: you need to tell the app that it needs to go to quotes.php?start=0&limit=10
[00:05:10] <kawohi> I do..
[00:05:25] <kawohi> .ajax({                     url: "quotes.php?start=" + start + "&limit=" + limit,
[00:05:39] <Ortund> are those variables getting their values correctly?
[00:06:38] <nisseni> I have made a small validation for a form, and most values I'm validating with .val() > 2 however, telephone no that starts with 0 - I tried .length() > 2 but it doesn't seem to work... any ideas?
[00:07:13] <kawohi> http://pastie.org/3206108
[00:09:16] <Ortund> kawohi: http://pastie.org/3206113
[00:10:45] <Andres75> @Ortund > thanks for taking the time to look, as you might have noticed, the call to the plugin via the div class "two" is commented out. I was testing it by calling the plugin with a generic $('div') but it does not work this way
[00:12:13] <Andres75> obviously a jquery plugin should work with any kind of standard selector you associate it to
[00:15:09] <kawohi> Ortund:  now I get a weird error. Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < http://kdevs.site40.net/
[00:15:26] <kawohi> by the way Ortund thank you so much for helping me.
[00:19:26] <kawohi> Ortund: see anything wrong?
[00:20:38] <Ortund> kawohi, check id 44, that's mine...
[00:20:53] <Ortund> I don't see anything wrong with the submission process
[00:21:26] <kawohi> No it's not the submission. scroll down and click "get more"
[00:21:52] <kawohi> and great quote btw :)
[00:22:27] <Ortund> ^^
[00:22:42] <mindis|wurk> what the...IE refuses to insert the html i give (through jquery) to my iframe
[00:22:54] <Ortund> hit it
[00:22:54] <mindis|wurk> works in FF and chrome. goddamnit
[00:22:59] <kawohi> So do you see the problem?
[00:23:25] <Ortund> kawohi: that button, is it just a submit for the form?
[00:24:03] <kawohi> http://kdevs.site40.net/#more it's suppose to fetch more quotes and hide the others.
[00:24:14] <kawohi> yes, just for the form.
[00:24:47] <kawohi> Everytime I click more it gets Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[00:25:43] <nominee> hello
[00:26:20] <Ortund> kawohi: add this to the end of your mysql_query >> or die(mysql_error())
[00:26:24] <nominee> why is the doAdd-Function executed when the code is rendered, it should first executed "onclick" : http://pastebin.com/rSnH7upm ??
[00:27:21] <Ortund> nominee, you haven't tied it to an event handler
[00:27:49] <Ortund> var doAdd = $('.button').click(function() {...
[00:28:06] <nominee> ok, thx a lot :)
[00:28:37] <kawohi> Ortund: I just noticed, after putting in your $result line, syntax highlighting goes off..
[00:29:11] <Ortund> sec
[00:29:11] <kawohi> http://pastie.org/3206182
[00:31:55] <Ortund> my bad kawohi, I missed a .
[00:32:16] <Ortund> http://pastie.org/3206113
[00:32:39] <kawohi> it's $link and not link, correct?
[00:33:10] <Ortund> yes
[00:33:17] <Ortund> didn't see that either
[00:34:06] <Ortund> GAH, I'm spacing out here lol, take the reference to link out of the $sql variable I pasted
[00:35:29] <kawohi> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[00:35:36] <kawohi> http://kdevs.site40.net/#more
[00:35:44] <Ortund> http://pastie.org/3206113
[00:36:05] <Ortund> I use PDO, so not 100% sure about the mysql_ syntax
[00:36:26] <Ortund> I'm assuming $link is defined in inc/connect.php ...
[00:36:55] <kawohi> yeah the last one throws off, and yeah
[00:37:28] <thinced> kawohi, how about the whole query?
[00:38:28] <Ortund> wait a minute... kawohi, you can remove the last " from the $sql line... right before the ; ... it's gonna break with that there
[00:39:12] <Ortund> yeah, http://pastie.org/3206113 looks better kawohi
[00:40:10] <kawohi> okay, tried. still doesn't work. doesn't throw an error this time though
[00:40:39] <kawohi> When I had to submit the form, I had to use .delegate() for the ajax to work, wouldn't I need to use that function again for this to work also?
[00:41:34] <Ortund> kawohi, possibly... but also check that $start and $limit are actually getting values (add echoes under their $_GET lines)
[00:41:54] <kawohi> example?
[00:44:27] <kawohi> okay after your editing, it doesn't work but in the HTML, I see that it goes to 45..... to 35...
[00:44:47] <kawohi> after clicking.
[00:44:57] <Ortund> can't help with the .delegate() part, but... http://pastie.org/3206113    there's the echo
[00:46:25] <kawohi> Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[00:46:56] <Ortund> what line does it mention?
[00:48:03] <kawohi> http://kdevs.site40.net/ after clicking get more.
[00:48:34] <kawohi> hope I can get this to work... gotta pay my bill tomrrow if I can get this finished :/
[00:49:01] <Ortund> It doesn't show me any errors
[00:49:48] <kawohi> Did you click get more?
[00:49:53] <Ortund> yes
[00:50:03] <kawohi> using chrome inspector?
[00:50:48] <kawohi> http://pastie.org/3206232
[00:54:21] <kawohi> see any problem?
[00:56:29] <kawohi> damn :/
[00:56:37] <Ortund> The error suggests there's a problem with a variable declaration in the javascript
[00:57:43] <Ortund> I suggest you move the var currentIndex = 0; line to make it global, otherwise the click will only change the quotes onces
[00:59:38] <Andres75> Ortund, any chance of you to give a look at my code once you're done with kawohi?
[00:59:45] <kawohi> Would you like to take a closer look at the files? Just to see the problem? I really need to fix this......
[01:00:43] <Ortund> kawohi just throw it all into pastebin.org
[01:01:30] <Ortund> Andres75, shoot
[01:01:32] <kawohi> Okay.
[01:02:32] <Andres75> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/iComposer.0.1.jquery.js
[01:02:59] <Andres75> that's the code...
[01:03:21] <Andres75> it works when targeting a single element, but not when you use the generic selector
[01:05:01] <kawohi> Okay I used pastie since I can define sections http://pastie.org/private/axrvjxxuye20xdnxt9dyea
[01:05:03] <Ortund> what happens when you target a generic selector?
[01:06:00] <kawohi> oh and http://pastie.org/3206300
[01:07:36] <Andres75> @Ortund > it only appends to the second one
[01:09:06] <Ortund> Andres75 are you talking about the setupScene function?
[01:09:55] <diegoviola> uhm, some client just contacted me, he wanted to hire me to add some content to his Flash page, I told him I don't support Flash and instead I offered him to get rid of it and replace it with open standards, that felt really good.
[01:10:13] <diegoviola> he probably will reject my suggestion but at least I feel I did the right thing
[01:10:29] <kawohi> Ortund: see anything wrong?
[01:10:54] <rahmen> Hi! I've been looking for a plugin that pulses an element but instead of using opacity I want it to pulse in size. I can't seem to find any, I'm suspecting my google skills are too bad, but maybe anyone here knows a plugin? I want it to pulse indefinitely.
[01:11:03] <Andres75> well I don't know where the problem lies, I think it's all about how I return the object... if I use "return this.each(function(){})" it works on single divs but not on generic divs, if instead I just do "return this" it works the opposite way
[01:12:28] <Andres75> it's been baffling me for days now... I also asked another couple of ppl, but to no avail yet
[01:13:11] <Ortund> kawohi, when you go to quotes.php?start=20&limit=60 ... what does that echo say? Should be "Start = 20 | Limit = 60"
[01:13:52] <kawohi> yup http://kdevs.site40.net/quotes.php?start=20&limit=60
[01:14:25] <Ortund> ok, so you can take that line out...
[01:14:33] <Ortund> not the problem obviously
[01:16:38] <kawohi> okay
[01:16:55] <kawohi> So, can we assume that the problem is not quote.php?
[01:17:02] <Ortund> kawohi, here's a shot in the dark, but try chainging currentIndex += 10; to currentIndex = currentIndex + 10
[01:17:03] <kawohi> Since it is doing what's it suppose to do.
[01:17:09] <Ortund> no, the problem is with the javascript
[01:17:25] <Ortund> otherwise Chrome's console wouldn't catch it
[01:18:24] <kawohi> Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment (anonymous function) $.ajax.success/virallikesproject/:26 f.Callbacks.njquery.js:2 f.Callbacks.o.fireWithjquery.js:2 wjquery.js:4 f.support.ajax.f.ajaxTransport.send.d
[01:19:28] <Ortund> It's something to do with variable declaration... I don't see it
[01:20:44] <kawohi> maybe its var currentIndex = 0;?
[01:21:49] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please suggest a good site preloader? i would like to place a custom image in a sort of animation before all the content of the webpage is loaded
[01:21:52] <Wiz_KeeD> any thoughts please?
[01:22:41] <Ortund> Na, kawohi, there's nothing wrong with that...
[01:23:05] <Ortund> or in getQuotes() {} otherwise, it wouldn't get the initial list
[01:23:17] <nVee> I need to iterate through a select tag and look for an <option> which value is equal to a specific item, and then add the selected=selected parameter to that option, anyone able to shoot me in the right direction?
[01:23:31] <kawohi> :/
[01:25:02] <Ortund> nVee, know how to use .each ?
[01:25:03] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please suggest a good site preloader? i would like to place a custom image in a sort of animation before all the content of the webpage is loaded
[01:25:26] <kawohi> see anything else ort?
[01:26:07] <Ortund> kawohi: move the currentIndex declaration back into the click function and see what it does... on to trial and error now
[01:26:24] <Andres75> @Wiz_Keed > something like $('<optionid>').find(select[val="yourval"]).attr("selected")
[01:26:43] <Wiz_KeeD> what is with that code Andres75 ?
[01:26:44] <Andres75> it's not the correct syntax, just a pointer
[01:27:06] <Ortund> Andres75 you mean nVee
[01:27:09] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, since installing the slider on http://www.pixelwow.co.uk/ my other jquery "fader" hasn't worked. The fader is in the testimonials on the left hand side. There should only be one testimonial showing and it fades to the next, any ideas?
[01:27:13] <Ortund> Wiz_KeeD wants a preloader
[01:27:15] <Andres75> oh sorry
[01:27:23] <Andres75> I misread
[01:27:29] <Andres75> XD
[01:27:46] <Wiz_KeeD> hah
[01:27:50] <nVee> haha was busy typing a reply to Ortund
[01:27:56] <Andres75>  need glasses
[01:27:56] <kawohi> nope, nothing. same thing
[01:27:58] <nVee> andres75, that looks like a winner :P
[01:28:00] <Wiz_KeeD> found this one, but it starts loading and never ends
[01:28:00] <Wiz_KeeD> http://www.gayadesign.com/diy/queryloader-preload-your-website-in-style/
[01:28:04] <Wiz_KeeD> never hits the done function
[01:28:40] <jamov> is that like gaya design or gay a design
[01:30:56] <Ortund> kawohi, dunno m8... move the jquery to the bottom of the page maybe? *shrugs* clutching at straws anyone?
[01:31:17] <kawohi> what if i zip up the files and you try? :3..
[01:31:34] <Wiz_KeeD> jamov, i wondered the same thing lol
[01:32:35] <Ortund> kawohi I doubt my boss would like that much
[01:32:53] <kawohi> ohh i see
[01:33:50] <roswell> hi. the code $( ':checkbox' ).button( { icons: { primary: $( this ).is( ':checked' ) ? 'icon1' : 'icon2' } } ); has no effect, since is( ':checked' ) always returns false despite of actual checkbox status. am i missing smth?
[01:34:46] <kawohi> blah mi gf broke up with me and now my electric will go off tomorrow. damnit, worst luck ever.
[01:36:08] <Ortund> kawohi put the current jquery onto stackoverflow and see if anyone there can help
[01:38:22] <kawohi> it's 4:37am and everytime I do ask a question around this time, not much help. I guess I'll have to wait till tomorrrow
[01:38:36] <Wiz_KeeD> Ortund, any thoughts on a site preloader?
[01:39:33] <Pumi> hello
[01:40:23] <kawohi> maybe if you re-read this again..... http://stackoverflow.com/a/8899969/538786
[01:40:42] <Pumi> i got a problem with .append() in IE
[01:41:04] <Pumi> when after appending something to div its height becomes larger, then IE scroll jumps to top
[01:41:10] <Pumi> http://molosgroup.com/#
[01:41:13] <Pumi> here you can see it
[01:41:20] <Pumi> if you go to bottom it appends text
[01:42:22] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, since installing the slider on http://www.pixelwow.co.uk/ my other jquery "fader" hasn't worked. The fader is in the testimonials on the left hand side. There should only be one testimonial showing and it fades to the next, any ideas?
[01:43:58] <Ortund> Wiz_KeeD don't have a clue... sorry
[01:44:08] <Wiz_KeeD> oh ok, thanks
[01:44:16] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: You've looked at the error messages in the console?
[01:44:30] <fRAiLtY-> I don't have a console, I'm in Chrome how can I access this?
[01:44:58] <kawohi> Ortund: how would I wrap that function and the click with .delegate()... i wanna try...
[01:45:06] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: menu/tools/javascript console
[01:45:21] <Ortund> kawohi, I've never worked with ajax before
[01:46:10] <roswell> fRAiLtY-, also F12 toggles the console
[01:46:56] <Pumi> anyone on my problem :P
[01:47:48] <Zenger> Hi guys. suppose I have a page wich has on it an iframe, can I handle the main page from the iframe, assuming that it's on the same domain ? Or there is that browser security issue ?
[01:48:22] <anticom> Pumi afaik, there are some lazy loading plugins already
[01:48:28] <anticom> maybe you'll give them a try
[01:48:57] <anticom> and anyway... making js compatible with IE sucks since it was invented :D
[01:49:17] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[01:49:20] <Ortund> anticom: +1 internets for you sir
[01:49:32] <fRAiLtY-> I have 4 errors, http://pastebin.com/puty6qet
[01:49:37] <anticom> Pumi http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload there you go
[01:49:45] <anticom> Ortund yessir :D
[01:49:46] <silv3r_m00n> I need to select an input control by its name , the name contains [ and ]  input[name=amount[]]  << how to go about this ?
[01:50:24] <fRAiLtY-> I have 4 errors, http://pastebin.com/puty6qet
[01:50:26] <Pumi> anticom, firstly i was using the lazy loading plugins, but it was slow on 400+ images
[01:50:40] <anticom> hmmm
[01:50:48] <kawohi> Ortund:  this is how i got it to work with my form http://pastie.org/3206484
[01:50:48] <Pumi> but this way is better i think
[01:50:51] <Pumi> with ajax
[01:50:59] <anticom> so how did you solve it?
[01:51:39] <Pumi> let me upload the functional files :P
[01:51:48] <Pumi> i am appending just text, just to test it
[01:52:00] <anticom> go for jsfiddle
[01:52:34] <Pumi> here http://molosgroup.com/#
[01:52:38] <Pumi> now it loads thumbs
[01:53:42] <anticom> so you're detecting, wether screen is near bottom and then start loading the next set of thumbs?
[01:53:51] <Pumi> yeah
[01:54:00] <Pumi> and it works all fine
[01:54:06] <Pumi> just in IE it jumps to top
[01:54:08] <anticom> try to append them with display:none and make them visible afterwards
[01:54:19] <Pumi> uhm ok
[01:57:05] <Pumi> no luck :S
[01:57:19] <anticom> hmm
[01:57:53] <mindis|wurk> ergh. jquery still has no way to go when it comes to having IE event handling match those of FF and chrome
[01:58:00] <mindis|wurk> *a long way to go :D
[01:58:04] <siebo> I'm having an issue with autotab where the enter button seems to be disabled on fields with autotab enabled
[01:58:10] <siebo> anyone else come across this?
[01:58:54] <Pumi> ill try something like $(".boxes").html( $(".boxes").html + data ); ?
[01:59:40] <Pumi> anyway anticom, did you try it in ie does it happen to you too ?
[01:59:55] <Ortund> kawohi if I understand .delegate() right, it might work when you click the button, but not necessarily when the page loads
[02:00:10] <anticom> Pumi yup, it does
[02:00:45] <anticom> i'd like to know where in the process it actually happens, that IE jumps up
[02:00:50] <kawohi> Well, the purpose is to after clicking, load in the data.... is that what you mean?
[02:01:11] <woozly> how to wait until effect end? $("#numbers").fadeOut('slow)
[02:01:16] <woozly> oops, sorry
[02:01:28] <Pumi> let me change it to appending text only
[02:01:30] <woozly> how to wait until effect end? $("#numbers").fadeOut('slow').html('some number..').fadeIn('slow'); ?
[02:01:30] <Pumi> and you can see it
[02:01:44] <woozly> I need to fadeOut, change context, fade in
[02:01:49] <ravenzz> ..
[02:02:07] <ravenzz> use the fadeOut callback
[02:02:20] <ravenzz> ?fadeOut @ woozly
[02:02:20] <bot-t> woozly, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[02:02:44] <Ortund> kawohi, yes.. hmmm... try tying a document.ready handler to getQuotes
[02:02:52] <ravenzz> .fadeOut('slow', function(){ $(this).html(foo).fadeIn(); })
[02:03:09] <kawohi> example please?.. I am so tired, lol. can't think right.
[02:03:57] <woozly> ravenzz, thanks
[02:04:00] <ravenzz> yw
[02:04:54] <Pumi> anticom try it now, when you are at bottom
[02:05:08] <Pumi> just scroll up and down a bit for it to detect that you are at bottom and load more text
[02:05:11] <Kingsy> how would you guys do a ajax call if you didnt want the php to be available to the public --> jQuery.get('ajax/test.html', function(data) { }); isnt ideal.. it would be nice to call a "function" or something
[02:05:12] <Pumi> i mean append more text
[02:07:48] <Ortund> kawohi: $(document).ready(getQuotes(start, limit) {
[02:08:06] <Ortund> not sure that'll make any difference though
[02:08:35] <kawohi> gah :/
[02:10:44] <Ortund> did that break it completely?
[02:11:34] <AdvoWork> Hi there, does anyone know a way to download multiple files that are attached/linked/specified on a page or something?
[02:12:43] <AdvoWork> ie ive got 4 .pdfs that will somehow be associated/got at via  page, i want to be able to download all of these somehow
[02:12:57] <Pumi> i hate IE :S :S
[02:13:02] <Pumi> like all of you i guess :P
[02:13:09] <mindis|wurk> join the club
[02:13:20] <mindis|wurk> i was just trying to get my events working in IE. nope. nope. nope.
[02:13:53] <Pumi> i got a strange(?) problem on it
[02:14:19] <woozly> guys, how to prevent text selection on clicking? <span id="nextbutton">next</span>, $("#nextbutton").click(function(){  $(this).disableSelection(); }); <-- not working (chrome)
[02:15:05] <Ortund> woozly: try $(this).selected = false;  ???
[02:15:18] <woozly> Ortund, thanks Ill try it..
[02:15:42] <woozly> :( not working
[02:16:35] <woozly> oh, this helps: $(this).bind('selectstart',function(){return false;});
[02:16:39] <AdvoWork> urgh, im actually beginning to think there is no way to actually download a set of files via jquery or similar, can anyone comment?
[02:17:01] <fRAiLtY-> bigkevmcd: I have 4 errors, http://pastebin.com/puty6qet

[02:17:48] <fRAiLtY-> The bottom 3 are fine, but what does the top one mean?
[02:18:31] <Ortund> kawohi, make it something like "Uncaught ReferenceError on click"
[02:18:34] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: it means you're calling .slides() on something that isn't what you expect it to be
[02:18:48] <Ortund> make sure to paste the exact error message early in the question

[03:07:34] <fRAiLtY-> Hi guys, I'm getting this error: Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'slides' in this piece of code, why? It's occured since installing a jquery slider on the same page. The slider works however this script no longer does what it's supposed to. http://pastebin.com/icL7vNFF
[03:08:55] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: your call to .each is wrong
[03:10:43] <fRAiLtY-> bigkevmcd: It's a script that comes as part of a package, I'm guessing it's conflicting with the slider as it worked great until I added the slider???
[03:12:06] <fRAiLtY-> In Chrome Javascript console those are showing as extend.each errors in the jquery.js file which is just downloaded from google??
[03:12:16] <fRAiLtY-> It's the standard library
[03:14:30] <fRAiLtY-> bigkevmcd:  ?
[03:14:41] <risky_s> hi how does one save values from text fields to a multidimensional array?
[03:14:59] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: what are you asking me?
[03:15:11] <risky_s> for example http://jsfiddle.net/xjFLy/
[03:17:54] <fRAiLtY-> I'm sorry bigkevmcd I don't understand the error or how to fix it, I just know how it came about. The testimonal slider worked fine, then I added the large slider on the page and that works now the other one doesnt, so I'm guessing it's some sort of conflict. The errors Chrome are telling me are in the jquery.js file but that's the standard library file so there's nothing wrong there?
[03:19:36] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: Chrome tells me that they're in the source in the page
[03:19:45] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: line 635
[03:20:07] <fRAiLtY-> Which is this: jQuery(this).slides({
[03:20:12] <fRAiLtY-> What is wrong there?
[03:20:15] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: and it appears that "this" isn't what you think it is
[03:21:15] <fRAiLtY-> It's being overriden by something else or.. /
[03:21:15] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[03:23:05] <raj> why doesn't the demo here work? http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete
[03:27:12] <e6nian> how to match the end of the  page number(like 2 here)  in the url http://abc001234.xxxx.com/xxxx/seller/titem/index/page/2   ?
[03:28:24] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: I've looked at it again, and it appears that something is changing the slides element, but you've got such a huge number of JavaScript libraries included in the page, that it's not easy to trace which one
[03:29:02] <fRAiLtY-> bigkevmcd: I know, it's dam Magento relies so heavily on Javascript, if it's any help it worked fine until the inclusion of the easyslider library?
[03:29:16] <bigkevmcd> fRAiLtY-: maybe remove it then?
[03:29:30] <rzec> is there an event that allows me to track where the mouse is when it is over a certain element but also updated everytime the mouse moves (even if it is possible over it)?
[03:31:16] <ravenzz> e6nian var foo = url.split('/'); var pageNo = foo[foo.length-1];
[03:31:40] <rzec> found it, mousemove
[03:32:41] <ravenzz> you'd propably check if foo.length is > 1
[03:34:39] <mindis|wurk> nice. my app causes IE9 to implode
[03:34:52] <ravenzz> :d
[03:35:02] <mindis|wurk> got some stack size errors in jquery before it crashed
[03:40:59] <e6nian> ravenzz: thank you
[03:41:01] <e6nian> 'http://abc001234.xxxx.com/xxxx/seller/titem/index/page/2'.split('/').pop()
[03:41:09] <mindis|wurk> "out of stack space" and "stack overflow" :D
[03:41:16] <mindis|wurk> no problem whatsoever on FF and chrome
[03:42:46] <fRAiLtY-> bigkevmcd: Interestingly, if I remove the jquery.js file the testimonial slider works fine, but of course the main one doesn't. If I reinstate the jquery.js file the opposite happens :x
[03:43:47] <duderion> hi guys
[03:44:00] <ravenzz> e6nian yea that one is better than mine!
[03:44:11] <duderion> i have a problem with .serializing a form in a .dialog()
[03:44:49] <duderion> i open a dialog together with a form (with some optgroups)
[03:45:22] <duderion> on submit, i send the data via .serialize() in the post
[03:45:41] <duderion> and close the dialog
[03:46:13] <duderion> if i reopen the dialog, together with a completely empty form (none of the options are selected) and submit
[03:46:30] <duderion> serialize() still has the values of the dialog before
[03:47:30] <duderion> pretty strange, isn't it
[03:48:04] <duderion> i tried to remove the selected attributes on all options on dialog.close
[03:48:13] <duderion> and many more...but nothing helps
[03:49:05] <Xotix> Hi, i have a page e.g. www.xx.com/foo and 2 ankers #tabs-1 #tabs-2. I now want to have #tabs-1 or 2 added to my url (window.location) without a reloading.

[03:57:06] <handsomepig> do not understand~
[03:57:07] <g[r]eek> Hi. How do I open a jquery dialog from inside a standard javascript function's if / else condition?
[03:58:31] <xec> handsomepig: $('.chosename').mouseover(function(){ $(this).toggleClass(...) })

[04:00:01] <nFFF> Guys trying to make a simple lightbox, what jQuery function would be suitable to close the lightbox (i.e. remove a css class) on click anywhere outside of the lightbox
[04:00:23] <xec> handsomepig: you don't need to loop before binding
[04:00:33] <nFFF> I could use click()
[04:00:44] <handsomepig> yeah it works  thank you   xec
[04:00:48] <nFFF> but thats global, it needs to be when they click on anything but the lightbox, i.e. the overlay background
[04:00:54] <EdwardIII> hey

[04:01:31] <nFFF> never mind confused myself
[04:01:51] <EdwardIII> i don't think $('#element').ready(function(){ ... will do the trick
[04:01:52] <g[r]eek> put another way, is my only option for opening a jquery dialog to do it from inside a $(document).ready(function() {... ?
[04:02:12] <g[r]eek> is it not possible to open it in my own javascript if / else condition

[04:04:29] <nicholasschulz> thanks a lot :-)
[04:05:19] <mindis|wurk> though if you really want to use a variable for the value, you should remove the '' from around it ;)
[04:09:34] <EdwardIII> i massively upgraded my js power using break on dom sub element mutations yesterday thanks to awesome advice in here
[04:09:44] <EdwardIII> but now i need to harness that by registering for those events

[04:45:13] <airdem> hi, im tryining to use jquery.fancybox ajax feature on xampp but actually its not working
[04:46:04] <schu> airdem: did you set up your local site with a fake domain or do you access via localhost/<your_site> ?
[04:46:04] <airdem> the  php page in href="" is reachable but using fancbox (http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/) the ajax request gives an error

[04:46:50] <airdem> ok i guess i should read how to setup fakedomain
[04:46:51] <airdem> schu thanks
[04:47:27] <schu> airdem: i've never tried but i guess if you set up your xampp with a vhost and add that one to your OS (windows, linux) hosts file, it should work
[04:48:37] <talin_> i tried to use the tablesorter, but nothing happens. what is a good way of debugging? i tried to open the javascript console in chrome, but it doesn't tell me that anything is wrong
[04:48:38] <nicholasschulz> I have this var = bookId_34    -> I want to split the var so I get this: newVar = 34 … How can I do this?

[04:55:17] <xec> kul: what is that function doing?
[04:55:32] <kul> Its not doing anything..
[04:55:40] <xec> why do you have it there
[04:55:46] <kul> I want to fetch some data from data-infor attr and display it in p
[04:56:00] <kul> * data-info
[04:56:18] <nFFF> Anyhting wrong with this: jQuery('.overlay').click().removeClass('overlay');
[04:56:36] <xec> kul: try it without wrapping it in a function..
[04:57:03] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. Can someone help me with this - I cannot get the jquery dialog to open: http://pastie.org/3207196
[04:57:49] <airdem> schu i followed this tutorial (http://ailoo.net/2008/07/set-up-multiple-virtual-hosts-on-xampp-for-windows/) and i can now access my project via the vhost but still getting error with fancybox ajax request
[04:57:53] <g[r]eek> if I put an alert in show_dialog(), the alert shows up fine
[04:58:22] <schu> airdem: do you use firebug? what do you get when you inspect the headers / response html?
[04:58:35] <seutje> kul: make ur function return it
[04:59:05] <kul> thanks xec
[04:59:18] <kul> seutje thanks to u as well :)
[04:59:26] <airdem> schu yes i have this plugin but im not sure how/where to access the information you are asking for
[04:59:28] <seutje> kul: either $('#st_main p:first').html($('.st_thumbs > img:first').attr('data-info')) or $('#st_main p:first').html(function(){return $('.st_thumbs > img:first').attr('data-info');})
[04:59:33] <talin_> i am trying to use the tablesorter plugin. when i do, nothing happens. i am using the latest chrome... the javascript console gives me no errors. any idea what i should be looking for?
[05:00:18] <schu> airdem: if you open firebug, you have a tab "network", there you should get info what happens when your ajax request is fired
[05:01:09] <kul> nFFF jQuery('.overlay').click(function(){$(this).removeClass});
[05:01:59] <kaneda^> anyone awake?
[05:02:46] <kul> thanks seutje :)
[05:02:51] <kaneda^> i was wondering, if i have an ajax form field being created like: $('#modify_access a.modify_access_link').click(function (e) {
[05:02:51] <kaneda^> 				e.preventDefault();
[05:02:51] <kaneda^> 				$.get("ajax/modify_access_jsp", function(data){
[05:02:56] <airdem> schu: where is the information you ask for likely to appear. @JS tab?
[05:03:02] <kaneda^> how can i get the id from the link that was clicked?
[05:03:14] <nFFF> Anyone know why this isn't working: http://jsfiddle.net/Lr89P/
[05:03:25] <airdem> kaneda^:  $(this) ?
[05:03:30] <kaneda^> airdem, , like: this.attr("id");
[05:03:35] <kaneda^> is that appropriate?
[05:04:18] <airdem> maybe $(this).attr('id'); i don't know exactly
[05:04:56] <xec> this.id <-- sufficient
[05:04:58] <g[r]eek> Hi fellas. Can someone help me with this - I cannot get the jquery dialog to open: http://pastie.org/3207196
[05:05:12] <talin_> is there a quick way to check if your jquery loaded properly?
[05:05:21] <Lochlan> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/Lr89P/2/
[05:05:29] <airdem> schu: the only request i get is fancybox image "fancybox_sprite.png"
[05:07:55] <nFFF> Lochlan thanks :)
[05:08:08] <airdem> schu: ok i got it. was my fault
[05:08:29] <airdem> as always :P
[05:09:59] <Lochlan> nFFF: make sure you include jquery in the page
[05:12:10] <talin_> http://jsfiddle.net/fF2Hv/
[05:14:18] <schu> airdem: glad to hear you got it sorted out ;)
[05:15:13] <kaneda^> xec, thanks
[05:15:23] <kaneda^> xec, i'm trying to get a feel for how jquery works
[05:15:35] <kaneda^> i'm almost to the point where i could write my own stuff
[05:16:02] <kaneda^> right now i'm learning by example and modding existing jquery
[05:16:21] <snagnever> hey! where can i find the easing functions on jquery 1.7? is it still a plugin?
[05:16:26] <xec> this.id is vanilla javascript, the jquery way is $(this).attr('id') like suggested
[05:17:02] <kaneda^> xec, am i allowed to mix them, and if so what's the consequence?
[05:17:05] <airdem> schu: dont want to bother anymore but :P http://fancybox.net/ can you tell me where the js code for "Example of callbacks" (at the bottom) is? i forgot how callbacks have to looks like
[05:17:46] <xec> kaneda^: jquery is a javascript library, you use jquery in your javascript code, essentially
[05:18:17] <kaneda^> xec, i understand this, but will jquery have an issue if i use plain js at the same time?
[05:18:26] <kaneda^> is there some best practice?
[05:18:51] <impi> hello, i have never done something like this, so please forgive my stupidity. i have a counter which counts down a time. this is the time until the product in the cart is available. when this time hit zero i add a button to renew the product in the cart. this all works fine, and i can set a new date. Now my question. How can i let my timer run again without refreshing the page?
[05:19:05] <xec> kaneda^: i was trying to explain that the question didn't really make sense, but the short answer is: no, mix as you like
[05:19:14] <kaneda^> ok
[05:19:20] <kaneda^> so it wont interfere with the way jquery does its thing
[05:19:22] <airdem> impi: reset the timer?
[05:19:29] <impi> i am using this timer http://keith-wood.name/countdownRef.html
[05:20:00] <impi> airdem: im just wondering, how though? on refresh it's all peachy, but i want to do it without a refresh
[05:20:12] <airdem> impi: you are looking for "onExpiry" i guesas
[05:20:46] <airdem> $(selector).countdown({until: liftoffTime}); this code starts the timer right?
[05:20:49] <impi> im using onExpiry, to replace the timer with a button that say "renew your product"
[05:20:55] <impi> airdem: yes,
[05:21:15] <airdem> so you neet to execute this code at the point where you want it to restart
[05:21:20] <airdem> *need
[05:21:39] <xec> kaneda^: that depends entirely on what you're trying to do...
[05:21:42] <impi> do i use eval? this is the thing i dont understant
[05:21:53] <airdem> can you paste your code?
[05:21:56] <kaneda^> xec, i see
[05:21:59] <impi> sure,
[05:22:00] <anticom> hi all
[05:22:00] <snagnever> hey! where can i find the easing functions on jquery 1.7? is it still a plugin?
[05:22:10] <anticom> i'm fiddling with my debug bar http://jsfiddle.net/V2aDL/3/
[05:22:11] <talin_> can someone help me figure out why this minimal jquery example doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/pGCyC/
[05:22:30] <anticom> somehow i can't change the value of dragging
[05:22:33] <anticom> any advice?
[05:23:24] <anticom> talin_ relative src's ??
[05:23:34] <anticom> you need absolute reference to your hotlinks
[05:23:35] <airdem> impi:  http://pastebin.com/
[05:23:49] <talin_> anticom: you mean where i write /media etc?
[05:23:50] <impi> http://pastie.org/private/tdk5m5qyfd2vw70i1orpq
[05:23:53] <anticom> and there's no need to link in jq, since there's an option on the left
[05:23:54] <impi> airdem: ^^
[05:24:11] <SpoonKing> Hey, just wondering with mouseup events, is there anyway to make sure they fire, even if you move the cursor off the element?
[05:24:14] <anticom> talin_ http://this-is-my-url.tld/path/path2/js-file.js
[05:24:42] <airdem> impi: you can use $ instead of jQuery like: $('.countdown-165').countdown({
[05:24:55] <airdem> at what point should the timer restart?
[05:25:11] <impi> airdem: sorry for the confusion, i use prototype and jQuery (magento) so i just got used to using jQuery like that in noconflict mode
[05:25:36] <talin_> anticom: alright. i tried to write the absolute path (URL), and i still get teh same
[05:25:39] <snagnever> really? nobody knows?
[05:25:44] <airdem> allright, no problem, just my 0.02$
[05:25:47] <anticom> talin_ link?
[05:25:49] <impi> airdem: the timer should restart after a response from this function: onclick="updateitem();
[05:26:45] <xec> snagnever: easings are part of jQuery UI afaik: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/#easing
[05:27:29] <airdem> impi: the onclick event should trigger the timer?
[05:27:42] <impi> yes,
[05:27:56] <airdem> you already have defined the function updateitem()?
[05:27:59] <xec> snagnever: apart from "swing" and "linear", which i believe are included in core
[05:28:06] <snagnever> xec ok, i'll check it out. thanks!
[05:28:15] <schu> airdem: sorry, can't help since i'm not using fancybox
[05:28:44] <airdem> impi create a function that contains the timer code and it to the end of updateitem()
[05:28:51] <airdem> *and add it
[05:29:16] <talin_> anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/pGCyC/1/
[05:29:50] <bonhoffer> i have a series of checkboxes with ids 1,2,3,4

[05:33:36] <anticom> hmm dunno talin_
[05:34:03] <Tomasso> is there some way to load content inside an iframe's table from the outer page ?
[05:35:02] <impi> airdem: okay mate, thank you for the help,
[05:35:44] <airdem> there comes a point in life, where you have to give back
[05:35:45] <airdem> ... :P
[05:36:38] <redsquare> Tomasso, sure if the iframe is on the same domain as its container
[05:37:14] <impi> i think without us knowing it, we're all either doing a) our part, just enough, or not enough :P
[05:38:15] <Tomasso> redsquare, yes.. it only has a table with an id.. but if from jquery i do $("#mytable").html("blala"); it doesnt set it... may be the iframe loses scope?
[05:38:41] <redsquare> are you running that in the container Tomasso
[05:39:12] <talin_> hello, and spello again. any idea why this minimal jquery example does nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/pGCyC/2/
[05:39:20] <redsquare> ? .contents @ Tomasso
[05:39:22] <Tomasso> i select only by the id, the table is inside the iframe
[05:39:32] <redsquare> yes but the script is outside
[05:39:41] <redsquare> http://api.jquery.com/contents/ Tomasso
[05:39:44] <airdem> can anyone tell me how to use the beforeShow callback function http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/ (scroll down) - i just cant remember how it should look like
[05:39:50] <Tomasso> le me chec xD thanks
[05:41:14] <bonhoffer> so i can do the arbitrary checkboxes if there is something like: $(".a_check").click( function () { $(THE_ID_OF_THE_CHECK + "_textbox).toggle() });
[05:41:25] <bonhoffer> is there a way to get the parent's id like that?
[05:41:46] <bonhoffer> i tried playing around with attr to get it
[05:41:51] <sekyourbox> http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/  << I cant seem to find any reference to JQuery in this sample code.  you dont need to use the word jQuery when using the jquery functions?
[05:41:58] <redsquare> bonhoffer, this.id
[05:42:11] <bonhoffer> nice, i'll try that
[05:42:13] <redsquare> oh parents id? bonhoffer
[05:42:19] <bonhoffer> yes -- parents?
[05:42:19] <impi> airdem: beforeShow: function(){ alert(); },
[05:42:26] <bonhoffer> if that is the right term
[05:42:39] <airdem> impi: thank you very much. its been a long time
[05:42:44] <redsquare> ? whats your html like bonhoffer
[05:42:46] <bot-t> redsquare, html - what is the alternative of radio button. are they are really use ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4943833/what-is-the-alternative-of-radio-button-are-they-are-really-use-in-today-or-old
[05:43:03] <redsquare> bot-t, you are silent when I need you, speak when I dont
[05:43:04] <bot-t> redsquare, Is that a question?
[05:43:09] <bonhoffer> it is not really a parent -- there is a checkbox form element and a text box right below it
[05:43:19] <bonhoffer> i could jsfiddle an example . . . one sec
[05:43:30] <redsquare> below as in next
[05:43:30] <redsquare> sibling
[05:43:50] <redsquare> $(this).next()[0].id if it is a direct sibling
[05:44:23] <SpoonKing> Hey, just wondering with mouseup events, is there anyway to make sure they fire, even if you move the cursor off the element?
[05:48:56] <bonhoffer> redsquare: it is always next -- so that might work -- i just wish i had access to the id of the item calling $(".a_checkbox").click( function() {alert(THE_ID_OF_THE_CHECKBOX_CLICKED); } );
[05:49:21] <redsquare> the clicked item?
[05:49:28] <redsquare> that is this.id inside the handler
[05:49:42] <bonhoffer> ok, let me jsfiddle around to get the hang of it -- thanks!
[06:10:09] <SpoonKing> Hi, got a problem with varible scope. Can someone help me out, this is my code. http://pastebin.com/KNxuBQMN
[06:10:38] <SpoonKing> The problem is that the mouseup and mousedown events dont seem to have access to the varible mousedowntest
[06:12:34] <airdem> im trying to acces the loaded ajax content in fancybox beforeShow callback. any idea how to do this? heres my code and the callback code: http://pastebin.com/NmRviAVJ
[06:13:27] <airdem> using this fancybox plugin http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/
[06:16:18] <specialunderwea> Hi what is used to create documentation from the javadoc comments in jquery?
[06:16:26] <danzik17> SpoonKing: assuming you want to use the outer "mousedowntest", don't redeclare them with var in the event handlers
[06:16:46] <equivoc> specialunderwea: jsdoc maybe?
[06:19:58] <sekyourbox> I'm looking to change {cursor: "pointer"} when the mouse goes over text.  should this be mouseover (); or Hover ()?
[06:21:16] <XMan2012> i want to know how can i validate my input field in  jquery validation plugin with special character at the beginning  (for instance: "ES" this must be in the beginning of input field)
[06:22:53] <chachan> guys, I'm trying to use autocomplete from jquery-ui but it's not filtering, the "autocomplete" is showing me all the results, any hint what could it be or should I need to paste the code?
[06:24:51] <anticom> sekyourbox how about regular css?
[06:25:02] <sekyourbox> nope
[06:25:06] <anticom> why?
[06:25:21] <sekyourbox> this is for a frontend that can use javascript. not a real webpage
[06:26:35] <anticom> $(selector).css("cursor: pointer");
[06:27:27] <sekyourbox> stupid quertion, but what can the $ be replaced with?
[06:27:34] <sekyourbox> I dont like using $
[06:27:38] <SpoonKing> danzik17: I've got it to work, but only by declaring the varible as the string 'true' or 'false'. Do you know what I am doing wrong for this boolean value to not be picked up in the global scope?
[06:28:00] <equivoc> sekyourbox: jQuery
[06:28:14] <anticom> hmpf
[06:28:21] <dabear_> sekyourbox: var diddlydo = jQuery;
[06:28:28] <anticom> why don't ppl learn the BASICS first and then ask questions here?!
[06:28:34] <dabear_> diddlydo("#foo").click(...
[06:28:37] <sekyourbox> ok, just making sure, other people were making fun of me when I was asking if i could just put jQuery
[06:28:48] <danzik17> SpoonKing: you're redeclaring it in your event handlers.  and it's not in the global scope, it's on the scope of the document.ready function - two different things
[06:29:10] <danzik17> SpoonKing: if you want to use MouseDowntest in the outer function, don't redeclare it in the inner one
[06:29:35] <SpoonKing> Ok thanks. :)
[06:29:57] <sekyourbox> what is the difference between (selector) and ('selector')?
[06:30:55] <danzik17> sekyourbox: the first will throw an error since it's not wrapped in quotes...   selectors are strings.
[06:31:15] <fourlastor> hello everyone :)
[06:31:35] <Hooloovoork> herro
[06:32:19] <fourlastor> if i want to attach a datepicker to any item with has-date class, even the ones which will be loaded later, shall i use .on() ? if yes, in which way?
[06:33:04] <fourlastor> since it's an input element, it doesn't have the load or ready event
[06:33:17] <juha_> danzik17: selector can also be dom or jquery
[06:33:58] <webroasters> hi guys
[06:34:11] <danzik17> juha_: that's not a selector then, that's a jquery object or element :)
[06:34:42] <webroasters> this code works fine up until x increments to 3, then it doesn't do anything:  http://pastebin.com/gK3wEF2Y
[06:36:03] <webroasters> basically, i've created a slider, and it has 3 images in it. once it gets to 3, it's supposed to reset to 1. pretty simple. don't know why it's not working
[06:36:03] <Charliemo> ok so complete newbie to jquery but have a jquery function in my javascript that I need to recall when running anothe function in javascript how do I call it??
[06:36:20] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i make this ? http://screencast.com/t/5ZHwgDkZVfBi to appear on the left side of the screen when it does not fix ? like here http://screencast.com/t/PllxPlwaBzhB
[06:36:59] <juha_> danzik17: well, you can still use objects as selectors to do some jquery magic
[06:37:00] <Ortund> webroasters: why are you resetting x = 1 if (x == 3) ?
[06:37:11] <webroasters> it resets to the first image
[06:37:15] <webroasters> div, whatever
[06:37:47] <Danny_Joris> Hi, I have a popup that closes when you click it's background div. However, when there's a link in this popup I would like to be able to open that link instead of closing the popup. In JSFiddle i found another weird side effect I wasn't having at first. When you click the link, the red button div fades out as well, and I don't see why.... http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/yF4fx/
[06:38:04] <Ortund> I would change that to if (x <= 2) { x = x + 1; }
[06:38:11] <Ortund> anyway, that's not your problem...
[06:38:16] <avidal_> can i use a var for button name if i've written the dialog like 		buttons: { button1: function() {
[06:38:46] <webroasters> right. what is the problem, cause this should be simple
[06:40:14] <danzik17> juha_: yes, you can pass objects to methods to do something, but it's important to know the differences between various args / types.  otherwise, jquery will just stay "magic"
[06:40:42] <sekyourbox> can I have aN A CLASS inside of an A CLASS?
[06:41:01] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: A CLASS? what's that?
[06:42:00] <sekyourbox> <A CLASS=FU><A CLASS=BAR> TEXT </A></A>
[06:42:25] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: well... yea, but why would you want to?
[06:42:35] <Ortund> webroasters: can you jsfiddle it?
[06:42:36] <sekyourbox> JQUERY (".FU").HOVER(FUNCTION ()
[06:42:45] <webroasters> sure
[06:42:56] <sekyourbox> jQUERY (".BAR") FUNCTION
[06:42:58] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: pls stop it with the capital letters...
[06:43:36] <sekyourbox> just used to coding with capitals.  old school HTML
[06:43:55] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: yea, sort of stupid code as well...
[06:43:57] <webroasters> @ortund: http://jsfiddle.net/VUwuF/
[06:44:04] <sekyourbox> Hooloovoork: will that work?
[06:44:12] <Hooloovoork> $ (".BAR") function is a syntax error, so no.
[06:44:14] <Hooloovoork> it won't
[06:44:27] <Hooloovoork> i don't even know what you're trying to do.
[06:44:59] <Ortund> webroasters where's the html and css? I can't see anything without those
[06:46:18] <sekyourbox> jQuery (".mousehere").hover(function () {$ ('selector').css('cursor', 'pointer') }):   few lines down  <a class=mousehere> text </a>
[06:46:50] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: explain what you're trying to acheive with your code instad.
[06:47:10] <sekyourbox> mouse goes over text, icon changes to pointer
[06:47:37] <sekyourbox> or mouse pointer changes to pointer finger
[06:47:51] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: just set it in css
[06:48:14] <sekyourbox> that is what that code is trying to do.. I cant use a real style sheet
[06:48:14] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: no need to change the css to do what once you do the actual hover
[06:48:28] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: then do it inline
[06:48:41] <sekyourbox> how, just use <style> or something?
[06:48:41] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: inline is ugly, but still far better than using js to do it.
[06:48:59] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: well that or just <a style="cursor: pointer;"></a>
[06:49:25] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: the latter is exactly what JS will do
[06:49:47] <Musok> hey guys. here is my problem. i'm using an hover on a div which will animate it's height. i have three of these divs stacked vertically. hover works fine but now i have a bug when i move fast from one to another for example where it animates both divs non stop. so i tried to setTimeout with a variable to check if it may be animated or not. and the problem is? when i hover the div it's like its looping. how can i explain... even not moving the mouse
[06:49:47] <Musok> loops the events of hover.
[06:49:53] <Hooloovoork> just... slower
[06:50:31] <Hooloovoork> Musok: make a jsfiddle
[06:50:41] <Musok> Hooloovoork: haammm what's that?
[06:50:50] <Hooloovoork> ?jsfiddle @ Musok
[06:50:51] <bot-t> Musok, jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:50:58] <Musok> ah
[06:51:42] <sekyourbox> Hooloovoork: ++
[06:51:49] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: ?
[06:51:53] <sekyourbox> thanks
[06:52:04] <sekyourbox> wow that was easy
[06:52:09] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: yup
[06:52:46] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: it usually is, which is why it's better to explain the problem instad of pasting weird code =P
[06:53:24] <sekyourbox> I dont know much about css, I was under the impression you had to actually use a sheet
[06:53:34] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: nope
[06:54:00] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: it's damn ugly not keeping the separated tho
[06:54:48] <sekyourbox> if you think that was weird, you should see some of the stuff i come up with.  Give me a little info I make the most out of the little I know about coding
[06:55:12] <Fox`> is there any reason not to always use live('click' instead of regular click()?
[06:55:16] <Hooloovoork> sekyourbox: isn't it faster and easier to learn html and css properly? it doesn't take long...
[06:55:49] <Hooloovoork> Fox`: umm... not really but i think it's ugly cause the events won't bind to the element you bind them to.
[06:55:56] <Charliemo> ok so got a jquery element that finds address in google maps provides drop down and user selects
[06:56:08] <Hooloovoork> Fox`: that's just personal oppinion tho. also i think there's a slight performance cost to using live
[06:56:28] <similian> cheers
[06:56:34] <Charliemo> problem i've got is that i need to delete the element on the page and then when it is recreated the jquery dropdown stuff doesn't work anymore
[06:56:48] <Charliemo> think I need to recall the jquery stuff but not sure
[06:56:53] <Charliemo> how to do it
[06:56:59] <Musok> Hooloovoork: can't jsfiddle but... here is the pastebin http://pastebin.com/nPW3QDRM
[06:57:17] <sekyourbox> RON PAUL
[06:57:20] <Charliemo> am very new to using jquery so not sure how everything works
[06:57:30] <Hooloovoork> Musok: sorry i can't browse through code right now =P
[06:57:43] <similian> I would like to select $(this).parent().parent().children(".value").addClass("hidden")
[06:57:49] <Musok> Hooloovoork: ok :s
[06:58:08] <jeffsmykil> I need logic that lets me count number of hours between to times
[06:58:13] <Hooloovoork> Musok: i'm at work so anything that takes longer than a few seconds to check is not too popular =P
[06:58:21] <similian> for some reason it does not work?!
[06:58:32] <Musok> Hooloovoork: ok. i'll just upload this ;)
[06:58:33] <Hooloovoork> jeffsmykil: convert to unix timestamps
[06:58:38] <Hooloovoork> Musok: nice
[06:58:40] <risky_s> hi, I am having trouble with a array, I am trying to save values of a user when a user, makes multiple bookings and saves the values to an array...I am trying to print out the values however it doesnt print...http://jsfiddle.net/GrWV2/
[06:59:09] <jeffsmykil> Hooloovoork: luckilly they are strings in 24 hour time
[06:59:28] <jeffsmykil> so like 00:00:00 - 08:00:00
[07:00:21] <Hooloovoork> jeffsmykil: shouldn't be too hard.  just subtract the first one from the second one and babaow! you've got the difference.
[07:00:32] <jeffsmykil> yeah
[07:00:34] <jeffsmykil> good point
[07:00:36] <jeffsmykil> duh duh
[07:00:39] <Hooloovoork> jeffsmykil: also strip the :
[07:00:43] <Hooloovoork> and parse it as a int
[07:01:25] <niloy> how can I get "border-radius" property of a div?
[07:01:42] <Hooloovoork> niloy: $("el").css("border-radius") ?
[07:01:43] <jeffreylevesque> anyone know how I can cancel a setTimeout() with .hover() function?
[07:02:03] <Hooloovoork> jeffreylevesque: save it to a int and remove it on the hover event
[07:02:16] <Hooloovoork> jeffreylevesque: to a var* getting tired =p
[07:02:48] <chee> http://stopsoap.com/
[07:02:56] <jeffreylevesque> Hooloovoork: howabout something like - http://pastebin.com/UWQP9rHS
[07:03:19] <niloy> Hooloovoork, can you please check this http://jsfiddle.net/3n5WC/ and tell me if its working properly at your end?
[07:04:47] <Hooloovoork> jeffreylevesque: looks good
[07:05:14] <Wiz_KeeD> hey guys
[07:05:22] <Wiz_KeeD> can anyone please tell me how can i detected wether a browser supports css3 or not?
[07:05:35] <Brodingo> ?g modernizr
[07:05:37] <bot-t> Brodingo, Modernizr - http://modernizr.com/
[07:06:47] <Musok> Hooloovoork: http://www.covii.pt/site/new/
[07:07:07] <Wiz_KeeD> Brodingo, so that can detect css3 and html5 support?
[07:07:21] <Brodingo> yep, custom built to suit your needs
[07:07:35] <Hooloovoork> niloy: weird, that should work...
[07:07:36] <djQuery> niloy: setting the border radius seems to work on my end but not retrieving it
[07:07:56] <niloy> yeh I am really pissed
[07:07:59] <Hooloovoork> niloy: try jquery trunk or something
[07:08:12] <niloy> its not working even with native APIs
[07:09:06] <Hooloovoork> Musok: it queues up a lot of animations
[07:09:20] <Hooloovoork> run .stop() before running a animation
[07:09:25] <djQuery> niloy: width seems to work with .css("width") but not "border-radius"
[07:09:48] <Hooloovoork> so it's like $("elementtoanimate").stop().animate();
[07:09:49] <niloy> yeh dude, I know.... border-radius is something special
[07:09:55] <Musok> Hooloovoork: tried that already
[07:09:59] <niloy> its not working any browser!
[07:10:05] <Musok> Hooloovoork: it changes the animation and even messes more ehehe
[07:10:05] <Brodingo> might need a css hook
[07:10:12] <Brodingo> https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks/blob/master/borderradius.js
[07:10:16] <Hooloovoork> Musok: then you can put a lock variable on it
[07:10:35] <Hooloovoork> Musok: when an animation is running you set it to 1 and on the finished callback you set it to 0
[07:10:44] <Musok> Hooloovoork: like what? like a variable to say "dont animate now. setTimeout. animate now"?
[07:10:49] <Hooloovoork> and before doing any animations you check if it's 0
[07:10:58] <Musok> Hooloovoork: tried that but it's like its looping the hover
[07:11:09] <Hooloovoork> Musok: ?
[07:11:22] <niloy> check this http://jsfiddle.net/LEZA6/ even native api is not working
[07:11:30] <Musok> Hooloovoork: even without moving the mouse i put an alert on the hover and it gives me one alert following the other and the other and the other...
[07:11:34] <Brodingo> niloy http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/3n5WC/3/
[07:11:59] <Hooloovoork> Musok: yes, probably. but if you do this check before doing animate()
[07:12:06] <Hooloovoork> if (lock) return;
[07:12:15] <niloy> Brodingo, thanks dude
[07:12:18] <Hooloovoork> then it shouldn't matter that it's looping the hover event
[07:12:30] <Musok> Hooloovoork: hmm i'll try
[07:12:31] <Brodingo> niloy no prob, check out https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks
[07:12:42] <niloy> ya checking
[07:13:08] <jeffsmykil> I just got this in the console
[07:13:09] <jeffsmykil> _firebugIgnore
[07:13:40] <Hooloovoork> jeffsmykil: that's something from firebug.
[07:13:48] <Musok> Hooloovoork: something like this: if($MayAnim==1 && $(this).height() != '400px'){
[07:13:48] <Musok>      				 			$MayAnim=0;
[07:13:48] <Musok>      				 			$(this).animate({opacity: 1,height: '400px'}, $Vel+50, function(){$MayAnim=1;}); ?
[07:14:06] <Hooloovoork> Musok: i think you're over complicating...
[07:14:20] <jeffsmykil> Hooloovoork: well i figured :)
[07:14:24] <Musok> Hooloovoork: hmm how?
[07:14:45] <Hooloovoork> Musok: i would give you a code example if i had time, but i don't. sorry =P
[07:14:56] <Danny_Joris> Does anyone know why window.location = this.href isn't working?? http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/yF4fx/20/
[07:14:57] <Musok> Hooloovoork: damn thanks anyway
[07:14:57] <Hooloovoork> but basically. set lock = 1 before every animation starts
[07:15:06] <Hooloovoork> and on the callback of every animation you set lock = 0
[07:15:16] <Musok> Hooloovoork: that's what i'm doing on the example i sent you
[07:15:20] <Hooloovoork> also before setting the lock to 1 you do if (lock) return;
[07:15:40] <Hooloovoork> Musok: hmmm, ok then try
[07:15:46] <Musok> if(lock) return; ? that... i'm not doing... but ... what does it does?
[07:16:04] <Hooloovoork> Musok: if lock is 1 it doesn't run that function
[07:16:18] <Hooloovoork> so it skips over the rest of the code in the function it's in
[07:16:24] <Musok> ah ok i'm doing in other way
[07:16:54] <Charliemo> ok i'm really confused now
[07:17:03] <Musok> Hooloovoork: still breaks
[07:17:13] <Musok> because now... sometimes it doesnt work
[07:17:13] <Charliemo> need to call jquery function from javascript function and don't have a clue
[07:17:14] <Hooloovoork> Musok: ow well, sorry but i can't really help more atm.
[07:17:22] <Musok> Hooloovoork: thanks anyway :s
[07:17:38] <Wiz_KeeD> Brodingo, what do i need to select here for just detection?
[07:17:38] <Wiz_KeeD> http://www.modernizr.com/download/
[07:18:34] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD umm how would i know? just pick whatever _you_ need.
[07:18:47] <Wiz_KeeD> there is no detection function
[07:18:58] <Wiz_KeeD> all i need from that is to detect wether the browser uses css3 and html5
[07:19:02] <Wiz_KeeD> supports
[07:19:07] <Brodingo> yeah did you read how it works??
[07:20:40] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah, a bit
[07:21:31] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD did you have a question or something?
[07:21:49] <djQuery> ?dotimeout
[07:21:50] <Wiz_KeeD> how do i detect wether the browser accessing the webpage supports html5 and/or css3
[07:21:50] <bot-t> doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, it’s fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[07:23:16] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD GO READ THE DOCS :) it adds classes to the html element based on what is supported
[07:23:31] <Wiz_KeeD> where did you read that? i'm in the docs too
[07:24:17] <jeffreylevesque> can you pass a variable to itself: timeInstance = setTimeout(function() { rotator(nSlide, nSlide+1, timeInstance); }, 3000);
[07:24:19] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD the third bullet in that ul
[07:24:47] <Wiz_KeeD> hmm nice
[07:24:52] <Wiz_KeeD> so i need an empty pack then i guess
[07:25:14] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD you pick which features you want to test for as you probably wont need them all
[07:31:59] <Wiz_KeeD> Brodingo, i included it in the header it didn't add any classes
[07:32:20] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD are you looking at console or source
[07:33:48] <Wiz-KeeD> sorry about that
[07:33:50] <Wiz-KeeD> Brodingo, i included it in the header it didn't add any classes
[07:34:16] <Brodingo> Wiz_KeeD are you looking at console or source
[07:36:31] <Wiz-KeeD> source Brodingo
[07:37:05] <Brodingo> Wiz-KeeD modernizr is a _javascript_ library so changes to the dom will only be viewable in the console
[07:37:43] <Wiz-KeeD> i see no changes there either, something must be wrong
[07:37:45] <Wiz-KeeD> i've included it
[07:37:50] <Wiz-KeeD> just as it is on the download page
[07:37:52] <Wiz-KeeD> just hit generate and download
[07:38:04] <jeffreylevesque> how do i clearTimeout() of a timeout defined outside of the function?
[07:38:32] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque as long as the settimeout var is in the scope cleartimeout should work
[07:40:34] <jeffreylevesque> i have function rotateCycle() that has this line: setTimeout(function() { rotator(currentIndex, nextIndex); }, 3000);.     In rotator() function I have it recursively calling itself with this line:  timeInstance = setTimeout(function() { rotator(nSlide, nSlide+1); }, 3000);
[07:41:13] <Musok> anyone knows how to say that a div doesnt has a mouse? what do i mean by this... i want to click links under this div
[07:42:06] <Brodingo> Musok you can use css pointer-events rule though the support may not be great
[07:42:17] <Musok> Brodingo: exactly :s
[07:42:40] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: i want to clearTimeout on mouseover.  So in rotator() i havve:   $('#imagerotate li img').mouseover( function () {clearTimeout(timeInstance); });
[07:42:57] <Danny_Joris> seriously, I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here: http://jsfiddle.net/Danny_Joris/yF4fx/24/
[07:43:35] <Danny_Joris> I guess the click event on the background of the link takes over the click event on the link
[07:43:43] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque a fiddle would be awes
[07:44:08] <jeffreylevesque> a fiddle?
[07:44:31] <Danny_Joris> ah, well actuall, when I remove the fadeOut click event of the popup the problem remains....
[07:44:37] <Danny_Joris> actually*
[07:44:39] <Wiz-KeeD> Brodingo, is it enough just to include the script?
[07:44:40] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque a demon on jsfiddle.net
[07:44:45] <Brodingo> demo*
[07:44:56] <Brodingo> Wiz-KeeD yes it should be
[07:45:20] <Wiz-KeeD> then why in the hell can't i see the rest
[07:45:24] <Wiz-KeeD> should i get the full version?
[07:46:24] <Brodingo> Wiz-KeeD i dont know man, in the land of code demos are king
[07:46:34] <Wiz-KeeD> hahahah
[07:46:36] <Wiz-KeeD> <3
[07:47:19] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: http://pastebin.com/nFzxqUz0
[07:49:15] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque man you really gotta sort out your var declarations, lots of globals there, makes it kind of hard to debug since its not a demo. try to stick to one var statement per function
[07:49:24] <Wiz-KeeD> it does not woooorkk!!
[07:49:26] * Wiz-KeeD cries
[07:50:51] <Brodingo> Wiz-KeeD if you look at http://taylorswift.com/ youll see modernizer is in the head and when you inspect the dom in console the html classes have switched from "no-js" to "js csstransitions"
[07:51:03] <Wiz-KeeD> hmm
[07:51:14] <Brodingo> try to match that i guess
[07:51:16] <_slon> is ecmascript5 strcitly typed?
[07:51:43] <Wiz-KeeD> i am looking in the console
[07:51:52] <Wiz-KeeD> yet i see no class
[07:51:55] <Wiz-KeeD> ah
[07:51:58] <Wiz-KeeD> not the body tag
[07:51:59] <Wiz-KeeD> the html tag
[07:52:09] <Danny_Joris> you can't use links in jsfiddle ??
[07:52:18] <Wiz-KeeD> i have html class  js
[07:52:19] <Wiz-KeeD> just that
[07:52:24] <Danny_Joris> I spent my entire morning working on a link problem
[07:52:27] <Brodingo> _slon uhh ES5 has a strict mode but i dont that means its strictly typed
[07:52:28] <_slon> first pass through the standard and it doesn't seem like it is
[07:52:36] <Danny_Joris> I strip it down to just a link and it doesnt work.... :(
[07:52:38] <Danny_Joris> wtf
[07:54:58] <Danny_Joris> right? http://jsfiddle.net/RCgLL/
[07:54:59] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: if the variable containing the setTimeout (timeInstance) is global, can't I just clearTimeout(timeInstance); from anywhere in the js?
[07:56:31] <Danny_Joris> adding target="_blank" works
[07:56:41] <Danny_Joris> can anyone confirm?
[07:56:58] <Danny_Joris> I feel like a ghost here
[07:57:23] <Brodingo> yeah its not working in jsfiddle with just a plain click
[07:57:28] <Brodingo> shrugs
[07:57:42] <Danny_Joris> Brodingo: thanks! :)
[07:59:50] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: who are you /me shrugging to?
[08:00:41] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque that was to danny, if the variables are in the same scope it should work
[08:03:26] <adac> guys, the first time i load the page this ajax  is correctly executed: http://pastie.org/3208087 But when i want to chose from the select box again (when ajax already has been fired once) the rigger does not fire anymore. Any ideas?
[08:04:22] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo:  howcome if I do typeof setTimeout, it's value is an int?
[08:04:56] <jeffreylevesque> I thought i was having difficulty passing the timeout into another function to clear it
[08:05:05] <Brodingo> uhhh are you setting it as an int?
[08:05:05] <jeffreylevesque> but i realized i saved it as a global
[08:05:10] <jeffreylevesque> naw
[08:05:17] <jeffreylevesque> don't think so
[08:05:18] <Brodingo> cause it should be a function....
[08:06:39] <jeffreylevesque> that's what I thought
[08:08:12] <airdem> how can i prevent the submit button from sending the form after click. setting return false in click function didnt to the trick
[08:08:41] <Brodingo> airdem dont use click handler to prevent form submission as it can still happen with keyboard navigations
[08:08:52] <Brodingo> ?submit @ airdem
[08:08:53] <bot-t> airdem, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[08:08:56] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: timeInstance2 = setTimeout(function() { rotator(nSlide, nSlide+1); }, 3000);
[08:09:11] <adac> someone suggested that i should use bind( ) but I'm not sure hwo to use bind in that function? http://pastie.org/3208087
[08:09:15] <jeffreylevesque> alert('type: ' +timeInstance2).. displays '2'
[08:10:44] <Brodingo> i thought you meants setTimeout itself, not sure what setTimeout returns
[08:11:07] <jeffreylevesque> kk
[08:13:14] <dilvie> adac: I don't think you should use bind. I think you should use delegate. =)
[08:13:25] <lake> I am trying to use the jEditable plugin. Is it normal to call 'editable' on form inputs?
[08:13:50] <Brodingo> lake arent they already editable?
[08:14:02] <dilvie> Brodingo: that's what I was thinking...
[08:14:12] <Brodingo> never used the plugin but seems like its trying to polyfill contenteditable?
[08:14:39] <adac> dilvie, fine for me too :) do you have a clue how this would look like on my pice of code I posted? I'm pretty mcuh out of ideas
[08:15:14] <lake> true. i use rails and am having a metnal block as to how i'm supposed to submit the correct data to the server. :/
[08:16:15] <bonhoffer> http://jsfiddle.net/h8jYJ/ < -- is this a kludge or a good way to toggle a text area based on a checkbox?
[08:16:31] <bonhoffer> "#" + this.id + "_explanation" looks a bit ugly to me
[08:18:24] <dilvie> adac: Call delegate on the parent of #ontoevo-version-one instead of calling change on #ontoevo-version-one. Pass in '#ontoevo-version-one' as the selector, 'change' as the event, and then the function.
[08:18:45] <dilvie> google jquery .delegate if you need examples
[08:20:04] <airdem> var content = $(this.content).find('.content').html();
[08:20:15] <airdem> how can i convert "content" back to an object
[08:20:29] <airdem> $(content) only seems to convert the first element
[08:21:51] <Danny_Joris> Is it possible to hook into the $.ajax success event trigger?
[08:21:59] <tesmar> hi all
[08:22:00] <Danny_Joris> from another script?
[08:22:50] <Tiraspol> http://about.me/simplevincheck
[08:22:50] <tesmar> is it possible to inject JS into an iframe, JS that would make an AJAX POST and then use something like http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-postmessage-plugin/ to get the data back?
[08:23:35] <adac> dilvie, ok let me google a few examples additinally. thank you for your help!
[08:31:43] <adac> dilvie, hmm ok this is my first approach: http://pastie.org/3208226 but doasn't seem quite right... Ehy do I have to take the parent for delegate?
[08:37:10] <dilvie> adac: because delegate uses event bubbling to delegate events to an element higher up the document tree. Event delegation requires less management because when you have dynamic things happening on a page that might add or remove elements, you don't have to bind up the events for new elements, or unbind events for the elements that got removed. It's also more performant because there are...
[08:37:11] <dilvie> ...fewer event listeners watching for events.
[08:38:45] <adac> i see
[08:40:29] <dilvie> adac: event delegation has such great advantages, it's good just to get in the habit of using it in place of binding directly to elements, just because if you need to add functionality later that would require delegation, or if you need to turn your one thing into a collection of things that would benefit from delegation, your code is ready for that without refactoring. It's a good habit to...
[08:40:31] <dilvie> ...get into.
[08:41:26] <adac> dilvie, I understand, yes this has a lot of advantages! Does my code still have errors, it doesn't seem to work anymore? http://pastie.org/3208226
[08:43:47] <EBisumaru> Hey mans
[08:44:05] <dilvie> adac: not that I can tell out of context, but if you want to paste a mini replication of the code on jsfiddle.net, I'll be happy to help you get it working.
[08:44:19] <EBisumaru> I'm having a lot of issues with JSONP calls. Does anyone have experience with that?
[08:44:30] <mdpatrick> Is there a way to use the jquery ajax method to submit a form on the page? via ajax? I like using the complete method as a way of popping up a modal in lieu of refreshing the whole page
[08:45:05] <EBisumaru> Basically from what I understand, the string is supposed to be actual JS code of some type, for some reason. The reason I am using JSONP is because apparently it allows for cross-server calls.
[08:45:24] <EBisumaru> So I tried alert( { "some": "data" } ), and there's an alert
[08:45:28] <EBisumaru> BUT
[08:45:33] <EBisumaru> then it gives me this FUNKY error
[08:45:40] <fractaloop> If I eval() the response from an $.ajax call can I access global variables in the eval'd code?
[08:45:40] <adac> dilvie, I can try, never used that fiddle thingy ;)
[08:45:48] <EBisumaru> textStatus: parsererror errorThrown: Error: jQuery17103837463088647234_1326904928490 was not called
[08:47:04] <EBisumaru> Here's my code
[08:47:04] <EBisumaru> http://pastebin.com/Cpbeb98q
[08:47:27] <dilvie> adac: fiddle is cool. You might not be able to use the ajax on fiddle (cross domain ajax can be tricky), but we can replace it with an alert message or something just to make sure the event is getting delegated and handled.
[08:48:50] <adac> dilvie, http://jsfiddle.net/Jz7eH/
[08:50:05] <adac> dilvie, do we need somethign more?
[08:50:06] <EBisumaru> Adac: are you trying to get cross-domain ajacks as well?
[08:50:16] <dilvie> adac: I'll let you know.
[08:51:14] <adac> dilvie, basically I should select something and then the div <div id="pvc-priority-table-one"> gets replaced via that ajax call
[08:51:58] <adac> EBisumaru, not in my code
[08:55:23] <dilvie> adac: First comment - all of those change methods can be replaced with a single delegate if you switch from referencing by ids to referencing by classes.
[08:56:11] <adac> dilvie, yepp this is clear to me now, thanks!
[08:59:23] <airdem> is there an easy way to disable a form and all its inputs?
[08:59:37] <dilvie> adac: when we simplify the code, it's easy to see that the delegate part works fine.
[08:59:39] <dilvie> http://jsfiddle.net/Jz7eH/2/
[08:59:51] <airdem> like grey out everything, making submit button unclickable and freezeing text input
[09:00:18] <dilvie> adac: my advice is to start with the refactor so that you only have one ajax call for this, using the delegate function
[09:00:51] <adac> dilvie, I will do that! thank you again for your help!! :)
[09:01:09] <dilvie> adac: make sure that the change event is working first, and then use the debugging tools and network inspector to diagnose problems with the ajax
[09:01:27] <dilvie> adac: no problem.
[09:05:22] <adac> dilvie, still something is fishy in my code...but this might be an other error then (somthing in my rails code maybe). This function with delegate is not called anymore
[09:07:41] <adac> dilvie, anywaysI have to go. thank you again and see you soon!
[09:15:42] <natrixnatrix89> Hi guys.. Can you explain me this please.. As much as I understand, jQuery .animate() is using setInterval() to get to next animation frames.. But where ever I read about html5, everyone is strongly discouraging the use of setInterval() in animations.. And suggest to use atleast setTimeout() instead..
[09:15:42] <natrixnatrix89> Do you guys know what's the difference?
[09:16:02] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i make this http://screencast.com/t/nlrTGhnAL8Yx appear to the left side of the mouse cursor,and not like this http://screencast.com/t/VFkeMRNU6 ?
[09:16:34] <Eviltwin> natrixnatrix89: setInterval(function(){...},100); causes the function to be function to be run every 100ms
[09:16:47] <natrixnatrix89> exactly..
[09:17:16] <Eviltwin> The problem is that if something ties up the CPU for a bit
[09:17:22] <Eviltwin> They can queue up
[09:17:29] <Eviltwin> So you could hav ethe function fire like 3 times in a row
[09:17:40] <natrixnatrix89> right..
[09:17:50] <natrixnatrix89> but then why is jquery animate using setInterval
[09:19:25] <Eviltwin> jQuery uses the change in wall clock time to determine where it is in the animation
[09:19:46] <pronoy> Hello, is there a way to get the list of all the attributes associated with say a particular div or a div with certain class
[09:24:48] <scratcha> pronoy: .css()
[09:25:33] <NoiseEee> pronoy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2048720/get-all-attributes-from-a-html-element-with-javascript-jquery
[09:26:09] <Musok> I want to click on a link of a menu and change the opacity on a div. Any idea on how to do it? The link is inside a <li> ( i don't know if it influents something )
[09:26:09] <pronoy> NoiseEee: actually I was looking for something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1041344/jquery-multiple-class-selector
[09:26:18] <pronoy> NoiseEee: but thanks for that as well, this may help
[09:43:59] <kaneda^> hey guys, i'm trying to mod an example i found on modal windows (http://jsfiddle.net/hkN9y/31/) but I can't get it to work, any ideas?
[09:45:54] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i make this ? http://screencast.com/t/5ZHwgDkZVfBi to appear on the left side of the screen when it does not fix ? like here http://screencast.com/t/PllxPlwaBzhB
[09:48:07] <SixThreeOh> How different is jQuery mobile from jQuery? If I had a jQuery + jQuery UI based app how easy would it be to migrate to jquery mobile?
[09:48:46] <kborchers> Flavius1924: look at jQuery UI's position utility. it has collision detection that can do that for you
[09:53:27] <relix> Hi, is there a feature in jquery comparable to .live(), where it changes a property on any new elements according to a selector?
[09:54:21] <pifantastic> relix: nope.
[09:54:24] <Eviltwin> relix: First off, don't use .live
[09:54:57] <Eviltwin> If you're using 1.4.2+, use .delegate instead
[09:55:04] <Eviltwin> Or if you're using 1.7+, use .on instead
[09:55:11] <Eviltwin> .live is now deprecated
[09:55:31] <kborchers> I love how Eviltwin has been quiet and then someone says live and he's all "BLLLUUUUURRRGGGHHH, KILL, KILL, KILL!!!!"
[09:55:32] <kborchers> :P
[09:55:35] <pifantastic> relix: you're obviously adding new elements programmatically, so you should be able to do it then
[09:56:16] <relix> Eviltwin: I'm not using either, so it's ok, except maybe there is an event called "created" in which case I would use it, so thanks then
[09:56:19] <pifantastic> relix: if you want to avoid intermingling the two pieces of code, you can use custom events
[09:56:35] <relix> pifantastic: yes, and indeed I'm trying to keep presentation and logic seperate
[09:56:47] <ravenzz> relix https://gist.github.com/1003630
[09:58:34] <relix> ravenzz: thanks, nice example
[09:58:41] <sviatovigt> hi
[09:59:00] <sviatovigt> I have a link with some jquery attached to it
[09:59:23] <sviatovigt> how can I avoid reloading the page?
[09:59:46] <sviatovigt> I only want to execute the jquery code

[10:00:55] <NoiseEee> ie: disappear from the Params I'm sending?
[10:01:53] <sviatovigt> thank you
[10:02:08] <ravenzz> afaik they are sent anyway, its value should be undefined ?
[10:02:47] <NoiseEee> I'm looking at the Params tab of the request in firebug, and indeed they are not sent... maybe a firebug issue i will try chrome
[10:03:13] <ravenzz> can't you check on the backend?

[10:04:32] <sviatovigt> ups
[10:04:33] <sviatovigt> :)
[10:04:43] <sviatovigt> NoiseEee: it's not working
[10:05:07] <sviatovigt> I don't need to load anything from the server
[10:05:13] <sviatovigt> I just need to hide a div
[10:06:15] <NoiseEee> sviatovigt: wasnt talking to you sorry
[10:06:27] <ravenzz> ?demo @ sviatovigt
[10:06:28] <bot-t> sviatovigt, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:09:59] <pronoy> ....and expecting suicide reports any minute now, http://www.reddit.com/ is now offline

[10:10:24] <sviatovigt> although the result isn't looking very well
[10:13:19] <JJMalina> is there a way to determine what element a user is currently focused on?
[10:13:20] <NoiseEee> i must say that I think its a bit crazy that when using $.ajax, and I set data to {something:somethingDefined,somethingElse:somethingUndefined} that somethingElse is never sent to the server as a key
[10:15:28] <ravenzz> sviatovigt it is working, but the detach() removes it
[10:16:09] <sviatovigt> but I does it reload the page?
[10:17:00] <sviatovigt> even if I remove the deatach
[10:17:07] <sviatovigt> it will still reload the page

[10:19:28] <sviatovigt> I have the same thing but still it reloads the page
[10:19:29] <sviatovigt> :(((((((((
[10:36:48] <bonhoffer> I have a select box -- if I select "no" i want a div to hide, what is the best way to do this?
[10:37:02] <bonhoffer> i can hide it by default and then use .toggle
[10:38:31] <bonhoffer> but i'm not sure if that is the cleanest way to go about it
[10:38:43] <jedimind> .onchange
[10:39:19] <jedimind> $('select').onchange(function(e) { if e.val() == "no" { $('div').hide() } })
[10:39:21] <jedimind> something along those lines
[10:39:28] <jedimind> err not e.val but $(this).val
[10:39:29] <jedimind> sorry
[10:39:41] <ravenzz> it is change()
[10:39:55] <jedimind> in theory, what i said is sound, in practice, not so much
[10:39:58] <jedimind> kind of the way i lead my life
[10:41:16] <interopcop> I want to set display to block for an id which is hidden in a form, if an error message shows on the screen. Like this: https://gist.github.com/1634831, but it doesn't work. I suspect it's my test at the top of the functi[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[D[Don.  Can anyone help?
[10:45:19] <ravenzz> bonhoffer $('select').change(function(){ var foo = $('#divtohide'); ($(this).val() === 'no') ? foo.hide() : foo.show() })
[10:45:35] <bonhoffer> ravenzz: thanks!
[10:45:47] <bonhoffer> perfect
[10:49:07] <sarspazam> is anyone familiar with the mouseleave(); event not appearing to register?
[10:49:33] <sarspazam> there's a position:fixed side bar plugin I'm using
[10:49:59] <sarspazam> which doesn't have the ability to disappear when you unhover from it
[10:50:25] <ravenzz> ?demo @ sarspazam
[10:50:26] <bot-t> sarspazam, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:50:32] <sarspazam> but it does come with a close method
[10:50:51] <sharad_> hey
[10:50:58] <sarspazam> not sure i'd be able to make a fiddle cause it uses a third party plugin
[10:51:11] <sharad_> i hav a little problem
[10:51:16] <sharad_> in jquery
[10:52:13] <sharad_> i have made a php page for photo upload.How will i convert it into a jquery page ,please help!!!
[10:52:45] <ravenzz> sharad_ ask to google
[10:52:56] <relix> Hey guys, I'm using the Jquery UI "slide" to show a div, make it come sliding from above (like from out the top of the screen)
[10:53:03] <sharad_> tried a lot
[10:53:14] <sharad_> but was not able to do it
[10:53:27] <relix> however, the elements below it are instantly moved all the way down to the target position, instead of sliding down with the new element
[10:53:31] <sarspazam> yeah sadly the files i need to show you are at work
[10:53:46] <sarspazam> i just wondered if anyone else has noticed problems with the mouseleave event
[10:53:49] <relix> any way to make them slide down with? I'm unsure if I've explained it well
[10:54:01] <Eviltwin> sharad_: Take a look at this: http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
[10:56:09] <relix> actually, this is exactly what I want: http://jsfiddle.net/mucny/27/
[10:56:13] <relix> so problem solved :)
[10:56:58] <interopcop> anyone know how to make a div show if an li has a particular string in it?  http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/
[10:57:10] <interopcop> that li won't exist unless there's an error in the form
[10:57:29] <interopcop> and that li doesn't have an id unless I hack the underlying framework
[10:59:50] <minijupe> how do I select the form element that an input element belongs to?
[11:00:12] <Eviltwin> minijupe: $(inputElement).closest("form")
[11:00:36] <minijupe> Eviltwin: tnx, I knew there had to be somethign like that.
[11:01:48] <minijupe> Eviltwin: could explain something to me? $() seems to always return arrays, but then the methods often act on one element (the first I presume). Is this always the case?
[11:02:16] <minijupe> if I try to do $('blah')[0].method() I get errors. I'm confused
[11:02:16] <Eviltwin> I would say the majority of the methods don't only operate on one element
[11:03:24] <minijupe> Why does $('#my_id') return an array at all?
[11:03:29] <enjo58> I'm having a weird issue on IE7 (imagine that). When I call $('#mydiv').empty(), it empties the whole document after #mydiv. It's essentially the same issue described here: http://www.factsandpeople.com/facts-mainmenu-5/26-html-and-javascript/107-jquery-html-method-and-ie7
[11:04:15] <interopcop> is it possible to show an id if an li exists on the page and has a particular value?
[11:04:17] <ajpiano> minijupe: it doesn't return an array, it returns a jQuery object
[11:04:27] <enjo58> I'm working on a reproducible case (it's a bit complicated in terms of how I arrive at that call in my particular app), but wanted to make sure that it wasn't a known issue first:)
[11:04:28] <ajpiano> which has the same semantics regardless of whether it has 1 or more objects
[11:04:44] <minijupe> ajpiano: $('#image_submit')
[11:04:45] <minijupe> [
[11:04:45] <minijupe> <input class=​"button gets_spinning_wheel" id=​"image_submit" name=​"commit" type=​"submit" value=​"add image">​
[11:04:46] <minijupe> ]
[11:04:52] <minijupe> oops sorry for flood
[11:05:07] <ajpiano> minijupe: a jQuery object is very similar to an array, but it is not one
[11:05:17] <ajpiano> chrome prints it an as array becauase it has a .length property and a .splice method
[11:05:34] <minijupe> ajpiano: where can I find info on this jquery object?
[11:05:36] <Eviltwin> My connection just became incredibly laggy otherwise I'd explain.
[11:06:22] <ajpiano> minijupe: http://docs.jquery.com/Types#jQuery
[11:07:40] <ajpiano> minijupe: every time you do $("anything") you get back a jquery object, which has all the jQuery methods you are familiar with
[11:07:56] <ajpiano> when yo do $("#foo")[0].someMethod(), you no longer are working on a jQuery object, you're working directly on a dom element
[11:08:09] <ajpiano> if you want to get a subset of a jquery object by index, you can use see ?eq
[11:08:09] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[11:09:11] <minijupe> cool tnx guys
[11:16:00] <interopcop> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/
[11:19:22] <maraujop> Q: I'm trying to do something like $('form :input').filter(':not(.aclass)'.lt(4)
[11:19:26] <maraujop> but it's not working
[11:19:31] <maraujop> I'm guessing filter breaks indexes
[11:23:50] <minijupe> is there a more concise way to disable an entire form than this:         $('input', $(this).closest('form')).attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[11:27:52] <ericincoldohio> minijupe, give all your inputs the same class name
[11:28:13] <ajpiano> how would that help
[11:28:16] <ericincoldohio> $('myinputclassname').attr('disabled','disabled');
[11:28:35] <ajpiano> then he'd just have to do $(this).closest("form").find(".foo") instead of $(this).closest("form").find("input")
[11:28:45] <ajpiano> minijupe: you might want to use see ?:input
[11:28:45] <bot-t> minijupe, :input: Selects all input, textarea, select and button elements. http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[11:28:49] <ajpiano> if you want to disable selects, etc.
[11:28:54] <raj> oooh, an op
[11:28:57] <interopcop> how do I show a div based on the text of an li?  http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/
[11:29:00] <raj> ok fancy pants
[11:29:03] <interopcop> is it possible?
[11:29:13] <minijupe> ajpiano: tnx
[11:29:26] <ajpiano> meh why am i opped
[11:29:35] <ajpiano> must have forgotten to take off the badge
[11:30:08] <Wiz_KeeD> can someone tell me once i have modernizr included into my page, how do i print out a certain contact if css3 is available?
[11:30:12] <raj> doesn't matter, now everyone knows ;)
[11:30:17] <Wiz_KeeD> somewhere around here i guess
[11:30:17] <Wiz_KeeD> http://www.modernizr.com/docs/#features-css
[11:30:26] <kborchers> ajpiano: i'm going to second raj ... fancy pants :P
[11:30:26] <ajpiano> raj: most people already did :)
[11:30:56] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone please?
[11:31:01] <raj> oh ok, so you're saying I'm slow to the draw
[11:31:07] <raj> way to put me down
[11:31:21] <raj> all powerful op =P
[11:31:28] <ajpiano> Wiz_KeeD: there's a window.Modernizr object
[11:31:38] <Wiz_KeeD> and what do i do with that ajpiano ?
[11:31:55] <ajpiano> mail it to your grandmother to show her that you care
[11:31:58] <ajpiano> jk
[11:32:02] <ajpiano> you ... inspect it
[11:32:09] <ajpiano> console.log(Modernizr.borderradius)
[11:32:19] <Wiz_KeeD> so i can use anything like, canvas?
[11:32:23] <Wiz_KeeD> and that's how the check is done
[11:32:23] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[11:32:35] <ajpiano> no, that's the *result* of the test
[11:32:51] <ajpiano> it does all the feature tests and then adds css classes and puts the results into that JS object as well
[11:33:12] <Wiz_KeeD> so how can i simply check if it has passed the test
[11:33:24] <ajpiano> if (Modernzir.borderradius) { }
[11:33:33] <ajpiano> it will be true or false
[11:33:57] <Wiz_KeeD> sweet
[11:34:10] <EBisumaru> Heyyy
[11:34:12] <Wiz_KeeD> and i can do like Modernizr.canvas and have the same efect?
[11:34:28] <raj> can I reliably place a div EXACTLY at the bottom left corner of a textbox?
[11:34:36] <interopcop> ajpiano: can I do if ($("li").value == "Target date conflicts with a Scheduled Blackout.  Click 'Confirm' to proceed anyway.") { } ?
[11:34:37] <raj> absolute: positioned div
[11:34:45] <raj> positioned: absolute, rather
[11:34:53] <EBisumaru> [Q] So, I'm updating a <TD> through AJAX. I want to call something after it's updated, but not in the function that's updating it - because I'm loading a script in the <TD> contents. Any way to do this?
[11:35:16] <ajpiano> interopcop: nope
[11:35:21] <EBisumaru> I was thinking there might be an update() event, but seems not
[11:35:33] <ajpiano> interopcop: see ?val()
[11:35:33] <bot-t> interopcop, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:35:58] <EBisumaru> alternatively i could do a wait() callback, but that seems a little too hackish
[11:36:16] <Wiz_KeeD> says Modernzir is not defined
[11:36:18] <Wiz_KeeD> yet i have it included
[11:36:41] <kborchers> Wiz_KeeD: gotta spell it right Modernizr
[11:36:50] <Wiz_KeeD> haha
[11:36:54] <Wiz_KeeD> could very well be XD
[11:37:00] <Wiz_KeeD> thank you!
[11:38:21] <interopcop> http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/ - doesn't seem to be finding the li
[11:38:29] <interopcop> I'm not sure how to do this differently
[11:38:35] <interopcop> can anyon help please?
[11:39:09] <raj> is jquery ui's autocomplete script suggested over the regular jquery one?
[11:39:21] <kborchers> interopcop: there are a number of things wrong with that fiddle
[11:39:26] <trisox> interopcop: close type="hidden"
[11:39:30] <trisox> you forgot "
[11:39:49] <kborchers> interopcop see ?val()
[11:39:50] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:39:59] <Wiz_KeeD> i guess it works since the alert does't come out in ie7
[11:40:04] <interopcop> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/1/
[11:40:17] <interopcop> still not working :(
[11:40:31] <ajpiano> interopcop: li's don't have a 'value'
[11:40:37] <ajpiano> you just read the text
[11:40:37] <trisox> :P
[11:40:38] <interopcop> ah!
[11:40:40] <Wiz_KeeD> ajpiano, what about checking for html5 support?
[11:40:47] <trisox> and its $("here your selector")
[11:40:52] <ajpiano> Wiz_KeeD: html5 support isn't a monolithic thing
[11:40:58] <interopcop> ajpiano: so is it .text?
[11:41:01] <Wiz_KeeD> meaning?
[11:41:01] <ajpiano> .text()
[11:41:08] <trisox> or .html()
[11:41:12] <ajpiano> Wiz_KeeD: meaning that there isn't a simple test for "HTML5 Support"
[11:41:14] <jeffsmykil> if i run parseInt(08) I get 0 is there a way to get 8?
[11:41:17] <trisox> depends on how you wanna get the content
[11:41:25] <ajpiano> figure out which quote-unquote HTML5 features you are actually needing to test for
[11:41:26] <ajpiano> and use them
[11:41:27] <interopcop> WOOOOTTT!
[11:41:31] <interopcop> thanks so much genii!
[11:41:32] <trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/HkefB/2/
[11:41:41] <ajpiano> Modernizr automatically shims html5 elements so they are stylable in IE
[11:41:48] <tw2113> ^
[11:41:51] <Wiz_KeeD> test the tags with modernizr ajpiano ?
[11:41:51] <ajpiano> Wiz_KeeD: what say you read the modernizr documentation instead of having me dictate it to you
[11:41:51] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: radix
[11:41:59] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: parseInt('08',10)
[11:42:00] <jeffsmykil> radix you say!
[11:42:01] <Wiz_KeeD> i am i just find it pretty complex
[11:42:07] <trisox> create.element for the win :D
[11:42:18] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee: so here is the issue the string is a variable
[11:42:24] <jeffsmykil> and it coul be anything from 0 to 24
[11:42:31] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: as is my example above
[11:42:40] <jeffsmykil> with leading 0s up to 9
[11:42:46] <jeffsmykil> oh thats what the 10 does
[11:43:04] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: you always always always want to set that when using parseInt
[11:43:18] <jeffsmykil> i did not know thqt
[11:43:34] <jeffsmykil> knowledge I has it
[11:43:38] <NoiseEee> :)
[11:43:46] <raj> ajpiano, any recs for me?
[11:44:13] <ajpiano> jquery ui's autocomplete essentially supersedes the one from bassistance.com, yes, raj
[11:44:31] <raj> ajpiano, any reason not to use it?
[11:44:34] <trisox> Wiz_KeeD: http://diveintohtml5.info/detect.html
[11:44:35] <raj> cuz I wrote my own actually
[11:44:46] <raj> only thing is, I'm having an issue with placing the results div properly
[11:44:52] <trisox> read that 2
[11:44:55] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks for the info trisox
[11:45:09] <ajpiano> raj: only if you don't feel like loading jquery ui core and widget etc
[11:45:09] <trisox> ;)
[11:45:13] <raj> since I'm implicitly placing it under Any textbox with class="autocomplete"
[11:45:17] <ajpiano> or you love your children
[11:45:17] <trisox> and also
[11:45:24] <raj> haha
[11:45:24] <ajpiano> cause jquery ui autocomplete will pretty much kill them
[11:45:36] <raj> that's what I was afraid of
[11:47:55] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: got it working last night ;)
[11:48:10] <trisox> Wiz_KeeD: if you got the time paul irish: History of HTML5 and The New Vocabulary of Web Dev (SmashingMag meetup)  video: vimeo.com/34332821 slides: goo.gl/HiZLm
[11:48:23] <trisox> good presentation
[11:48:55] <Wiz_KeeD> unfortunantly the deadline is tommorow and i need to finish this script that loads a html5 player and depending on the browsers potential fallsback to a more rudimentary player and then to a flash player
[11:49:08] <Wiz_KeeD> so i need to check it it can handle css3,then html5, then flash
[11:49:22] <trisox> uhh

[11:49:38] <ajpiano> Wiz_KeeD: http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody
[11:49:44] <ajpiano> might save you a lot of heartache
[11:50:17] <EBisumaru> So does anyone know of an event that's fired when an element's innerHTML is changed?
[11:50:19] <Wiz_KeeD> ajpiano, i think you m ight have just saved my life
[11:50:29] <Wiz_KeeD> if it works as intented, i might need an address to send a six-pack
[11:50:40] <trisox> Wiz_KeeD: that is not to hard m8
[11:51:00] <m8> trisox, :O
[11:51:02] <Charliemo> i am so totally lost even after reading jquery tutorial how on earth do you reference a function in jquery from outside in javascript to run or am i missing the point?
[11:51:12] <trisox> :P
[11:51:17] <trisox> hey m8
[11:51:34] <EBisumaru> Charliemo: I think you are missing the point
[11:52:11] <trisox> Wiz_KeeD: http://videojs.com/
[11:52:13] <aca20031> how do you do an attribute selector for ..checkboxes that arent disabled? Obviously i can do input[type="checkbox"] but the "and not disabled" is...meh
[11:52:24] <EBisumaru> Charliemo: from what I understand jQuery basically creates a 'jQuery' object/class, also known as '$', with which you can do stuff.
[11:52:31] <Wiz_KeeD> what about it?
[11:52:38] <trisox> you mean someting like that
[11:52:39] <kaneda^> hey, i keep getting an error when i run this on line 11, is there something wrong with my syntax?? http://pastie.org/3209310
[11:53:27] <Charliemo> ok so I 've created some stuff and it works but is using $(document).ready(
[11:54:15] <selend> kaneda^: looks fine. What's the error?
[11:54:27] <kaneda^> syntax error
[11:54:31] <kaneda^> that's all it says
[11:54:48] <minijupe> how do I replace the inner contents of an element?
[11:54:51] <Charliemo> to run some code which is jquery and it works problem is that the html element that uses the jquery gets deleted and then recreated in my javascript on certain functions and need to know how to get the jquery code to run again not just when the document is ready
[11:54:59] <trisox> ?html()
[11:54:59] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[11:55:03] <Charliemo> at least I think that's my issue anyways
[11:55:10] <kaneda^> Charliemo, update trigger
[11:55:17] <minijupe> I see replaceAll and replaceWith
[11:55:27] <Charliemo> whats update trigger?
[11:55:27] <kaneda^> selend, so what's up with that?
[11:55:27] <EBisumaru> kaneda^: I think the problem is you missed the word "wrong" in "something went wrong"

[11:55:55] <aca20031> how do you do an attribute selector for ..checkboxes that arent disabled? Obviously i can do input[type="checkbox"] but the "and not disabled" is...meh. Also why is .change(function() { alert($(this).val()); }); always "on" no matter what
[11:56:09] <trisox> minijupe: what do you try to do
[11:57:05] <Charliemo> ajpiano: thank you am reading now
[11:57:24] <selend> kaneda^: which browser(s) are you executing this code in?
[11:57:27] <minijupe> I want to replace the contents of an element like <div id='mydiv'> stuff </div> with new stuff
[11:57:32] <minijupe> trisox: ^
[11:57:32] <kaneda^> selend, right now just firefox
[11:57:45] <ajpiano> minijupe: see ?html(...)
[11:57:45] <bot-t> minijupe, .html(htmlString): Set the HTML contents of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/#html2
[11:57:47] <trisox> use html()
[11:58:01] <EBisumaru> kaneda^: is "else if" the right syntax? i'm not a JS expert but maybe that's it...?
[11:58:02] <trisox> like pointed out earlyer
[11:58:16] <kaneda^> EBisumaru, it works in my other functions
[11:58:20] <minijupe> ajpiano: tnx yet again. i was looking at that as you said it. I really am trying to find info before asking here...
[11:58:26] <nicholasschulz> Uhm, is it so that IE doesn't support opacity-adjusted .png's? Take a look on this fiddle.. http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/6Qqxq/10/ Click on the picture and you'll see… If you have IE please give some feedback on what you see  :-)
[11:58:27] <kaneda^> EBisumaru, this is basically a copy of another fucntion
[11:58:30] <kaneda^> so i'm pretty confused
[11:58:36] <EBisumaru> Yeah, I guess I could have googled that. That's teh correct syntax for sure
[11:59:03] <Pookz> I'm sorry my IRC client crashed before I got to read that response :(
[11:59:29] <selend> kaneda^: what's your responseText?
[11:59:42] <kaneda^> selend, it throws that error so i don't see it
[11:59:44] <EBisumaru> kaneda^: Maybe try reversing the boolean? See if you get the same error? Maybe something from the 'if' block is wonking everything up
[12:00:03] <EBisumaru> Or, could be the surrounding code

[12:01:30] <selend> kaneda^: to be sure, it's not when you execute the code but when the file is loaded, you get a syntax error right away?
[12:01:36] <kaneda^> selend, so that isn't the problem, coudln't be
[12:01:42] <kaneda^> i just did a check
[12:01:46] <kaneda^> if called by a different method it works
[12:01:53] <kaneda^> so i'm not sure what's up yet
[12:01:59] <trisox> <a href="#lolcatdeluxe" >lol</a>    ()
[12:02:20] <trisox> <a href="#lolcatdeluxe" >lol</a>    $("a").attr('href');
[12:02:30] <trisox> returns #lolcatdeluxe
[12:02:42] <swashington> Hey everyone
[12:03:01] <aca20031> how do you do an attribute selector for ..checkboxes that arent disabled? Obviously i can do input[type="checkbox"] but the "and not disabled" is...meh. Also why is .change(function() { alert($(this).val()); }); always "on" no matter what
[12:03:10] <zatan> trisox, but if i have got <a href="/blog/"> and i want to extract just only "blog" ?
[12:03:14] <trisox> using prop is also posible
[12:03:44] <trisox> zatan: then replace /
[12:05:26] <swashington> Does anyone have any experience using the Scroll To Fixed plugin?
[12:05:34] <selend> kaneda^: what you're saying is that you're calling the function in one method and it fails, but works fine in the other function?
[12:05:41] <kaneda^> selend, apparently
[12:06:03] <Martijn_> What would be the preferred way to localize a jQueryUI plugin made with the Widget factory?
[12:06:49] <Martijn_> Can't use the method DatePicker uses, since it doesn't use the Widget Factory
[12:07:30] <selend> kaneda^: can you log the state of modifyAJAX before you call the function in both cases?
[12:07:43] <kaneda^> yah, give me a sec
[12:09:28] <frostbytten> Anyone know why preventDefault doesn't seem to be working with .on()
[12:09:48] <kaneda^> selend, ok, so the state is ready and status is OK in both cases
[12:09:55] <kaneda^> selend, and i'm returning the same data to both
[12:09:59] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: replicate your problem on jsfiddle
[12:10:19] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Already doing that.
[12:10:32] <kaneda^> selend, so that leaves how they're called
[12:11:07] <kaneda^> selend, can you tell me if there's something wrong with doing this: http://pastie.org/private/3r0lgcd6ygyqqtipyfypeq
[12:11:22] <frostbytten> http://jsfiddle.net/4XuT6/
[12:11:37] <Charliemo> ajpiano: looks like I'm gonna be a while getting my head round this
[12:12:03] <frostbytten> NoiseEee, and I tried it with 'submit' as well.
[12:12:39] <selend> kaneda^: the trailing comma in arrays should give syntax error, at line 4.
[12:13:02] <selend> kaneda^: slightly baffled with your eval problem though. Same input, one gives an error.
[12:13:04] <kaneda^> onShow is the next item in the list
[12:13:12] <kaneda^> so that comma is legit
[12:13:21] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: not really a working example, but whats the issue?
[12:13:32] <kaneda^> oooh, ine 4
[12:13:34] <kaneda^> selend, thanks
[12:13:36] <frostbytten> e.preventDefault() never fires.
[12:13:44] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: for one, if you don't want a form submitted, stop the submit event of the form, not of any clicked button
[12:13:54] <frostbytten> I did try the submit as well.
[12:14:04] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: No change there.
[12:14:08] <selend> kaneda^: no worries, I'm here to help :)
[12:14:11] <minijupe> hi guys i've set up a form to replace the submit button with a spinning loader when clicked, but replacing the submit button seems to cancel the ajax request. Is this normal? Not replacing it but appending it seems to work fine.
[12:14:19] <kaneda^> selend, well, good catch, but it didn't solve my problem :|
[12:15:01] <luke--> I'm trying to queue some animations, for that I use the queue-field in the animate options https://gist.github.com/2d0aab207184cfc7a958
[12:15:02] <luke--> the result is: *nothing* happens. what am I doing wrong?
[12:15:03] <trisox> minijupe: jsfiddle plzz
[12:15:42] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: you're setting your event handler before any $('.approve_btn')s exist
[12:15:59] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: add that to the callback.
[12:16:22] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Right, because they are dynamically created. I thought that was the purpose of .live(), .delegate(), and .on()
[12:16:41] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: .on certainly needs a real element
[12:17:06] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: to delegate, watch a parent, use .approve_btn as a selector within your handler
[12:17:07] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Sounds like they shouldn't have depreciated .delegate()/.live() without replicating it
[12:17:21] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: no, you're just missing it
[12:17:29] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Gotcha
[12:17:39] <Charliemo> ok so either need to use event delegation or event rebinding but not even sure of the event I am applying this to!
[12:17:39] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Needs to bind higher up.
[12:17:49] <selend> kaneda^: although, if you put a log as the first statement of modify_access_handler, does that even fire?
[12:18:01] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: $('body').on('click','.approve_btn',function(e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[12:18:07] <kaneda^> selend, of course it does, by that time it has the returned stuff
[12:18:24] <Surrealis> is it possible to do : var rbCollection = $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :radio : checkbox');
[12:18:50] <Charliemo> its an autocomplete  address box for geocoding
[12:19:08] <Charliemo> so would i use autocomplete?
[12:19:13] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/ay8hdrZN - I'm not sure what I am doing wrong here exactly
[12:19:20] <Charliemo> as the event?
[12:19:35] <trisox> Surrealis: check your quotes
[12:19:43] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Or like you were saying earlier $(<higher dom>).on('submit', 'form', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); that works.
[12:20:18] <frostbytten> NoiseEee: Thanks, I didn't realized it needed an existing DOM object to look at.
[12:20:21] <Surrealis> triox:  var rbCollection = $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :radio'); works with out issue
[12:20:46] <Surrealis> triox: was thinking that i could combine the selects instead of using a .merge()
[12:20:49] <Charliemo> i just can't seem to get my head round it if i was ablle to figure out what event I was meant to be binding to at least I'd get somwhere
[12:21:06] <NoiseEee> frostbytten: np
[12:21:10] <kawohi> Hey can you help me out? http://kdevs.site40.net/#more Clicking "get more quotes" will only load the next set one time, then after it stops working.
[12:21:32] <jeffreylevesque> if i have a recursive function that has a setTimeout(), and I want to remove the timeout().  Should I have a for loop and remove 'clearTimeout' on all?  And should I pop them out of my array?
[12:21:49] <jeffreylevesque> I push all my setTimeouts() into an array
[12:22:03] <selend> kaneda^: what is the responseText in both cases? That shouldn't really cause a syntax error on a later line, but still…
[12:22:14] <kawohi> my code is here: http://pastie.org/3209465
[12:22:27] <kaneda^> selend, i'm convinced it's the way i'm calling i
[12:22:28] <kaneda^> it
[12:22:54] <selend> kaneda^: ok, how are you calling the functions?
[12:22:56] <trisox> $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :radio ,#' + rbContainerId + ':checkbox'); ?
[12:23:11] <trisox> i mean radio and checkbox...
[12:23:11] <Surrealis> ohhh i can combine like that
[12:23:38] <trisox> you can do $('#lol, #lalala, .some, .thing')
[12:23:46] <Surrealis> hadn't seen any examples like that. yay!
[12:23:49] <trisox> chaining selectors and stuff
[12:24:06] <Surrealis> ohhh, thought i could chain everything but a "selector"
[12:24:14] <kaneda^> selend, i'm calling one like this http://pastie.org/private/27xgyrio2kwugxjq3po2dg <-- works, and one like this http://pastie.org/private/xlf3xqikq9ta1cz7jsyijw <-- doesn't work
[12:24:30] <Surrealis>         var rbCollection = $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :radio');         var cbCollection = $('#' + rbContainerId + ' :checkbox');           jQuery.merge(rbCollection, cbCollection);
[12:24:33] <kawohi> damnit :/
[12:24:36] <Charliemo> my code is here http://pastebin.com/VV69kZNd
[12:24:43] <trisox> $('#Create .myClass,#Edit .myClass') works fine
[12:24:43] <Surrealis> aweome, thanks trisox
[12:24:47] <trisox> np
[12:24:51] <Surrealis> indeed it does
[12:24:56] <kawohi> trisox, know anything about ajax?
[12:24:57] <trisox> ;)
[12:25:08] <trisox> soccer club or ... ;)
[12:25:21] <trisox> washing product?
[12:25:21] <Charliemo> just can't figure how and what exactlt to rebind or how to use event delegation
[12:25:41] <LordThumper> Is there any way to load an html file Async Cross-Origin?
[12:25:50] <trisox> kawohi: try not to use eval
[12:26:04] <kawohi> What would replace it?
[12:26:18] <kawohi> or remove that line?
[12:26:47] <trisox> ?jQuery.ajax
[12:26:47] <bot-t> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:27:09] <kawohi> I've looked at that :/. I got my form to work, I just can't get this to work..
[12:28:19] <SixThreeOh> Fixed broken wiki with jQuery: $("#mw-sopaOverlay").remove();$('div').css("display","block");
[12:28:42] <LordThumper> trisox: Cannot use that, the .html is situated on a separate subdomain
[12:28:57] <trisox> ?
[12:29:29] <SixThreeOh> You could always use a proxy.
[12:29:30] <trisox> wasnt reading your comment sorry
[12:29:34] <trisox> watching Ricky Gervais
[12:30:09] <LordThumper> Ah np
[12:30:24] <selend> kaneda^: I'm guessing the callback parameter is the handler. Want to try setting the second apply context to window?
[12:30:36] <SixThreeOh> LordThumper did you read: http://usejquery.com/posts/the-jquery-cross-domain-ajax-guide
[12:30:54] <SixThreeOh> I'm not sure what the limitations are for that but maybe you can get json containing html.
[12:30:54] <kaneda^> the callback param calls the handler
[12:31:55] <selend> kaneda^: ok. My best guess is the context though, probably what you were thinking as well :P
[12:32:03] <kaneda^> yeh
[12:32:12] <kaneda^> i think i have an idae though, one sec
[12:32:25] <selend> kaneda^: logging this on the first line?
[12:32:25] <trisox> whhee http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pykFzWCtZeY
[12:32:55] <kaneda^> selend, no, i'm going to change the function i pass as the callback param
[12:33:03] <kawohi> What would be an alternative to data = eval(data);?
[12:34:12] <LordThumper> Thanks SixThreeOh
[12:34:35] <minijupe> I want to update my page with new content via ajax. How can I use unobtrusive javascript in this case. I want to update the page elements whose class attribute indicates their functionality...
[12:35:10] <trisox> ? JSON.parse
[12:35:11] <bot-t> trisox, jQuery.parseJSON - Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[12:35:22] <minijupe> that wasn't clear: the new content elements will have classes, that should indicate their functionality.
[12:35:36] <minijupe> the new content is HTML string
[12:36:07] <trisox> i'm off cu guys
[12:36:40] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/ygb3PJWW - is this a correct statement?
[12:37:11] <minijupe> for example when I add this string to the docuement, <div class='get_funky_action'>Hi world</div>, how can I trigger the unobtrusive JS to attach the right methods to it?
[12:37:25] <xp_prg2> minijupe, do you want to use JSON or xml, I recommend JSON
[12:37:42] <minijupe> xp_prg2: the new content is pure HTML string
[12:37:56] <xp_prg2> minijupe, it gets the html via ajax call right?
[12:38:03] <minijupe> xp_prg2: yeah
[12:38:19] <kawohi> didn't make a difference :/
[12:38:47] <minijupe> kawohi: is that for me?
[12:38:51] <xp_prg2> miniupe ajax can be implemented/invoked via xml or json, which one do you want?
[12:39:03] <xp_prg2> what is your serverside scripting language?
[12:39:04] <kawohi> no
[12:39:08] <minijupe> xp_prg2: the ajax is already implemented
[12:39:13] <minijupe> the page is being updated fine
[12:39:41] <minijupe> but the html implies unobtrusive JS, that usually is applied on page load
[12:39:59] <minijupe> but since there is no load call, the new html has nothing applied to it?
[12:40:28] <xp_prg2> oh ok well $('get_funky_action') = html(html_var_string);
[12:40:54] <xp_prg2> minijupe does that make sense?
[12:41:09] <minijupe> I don't think we're talking about the same thing.
[12:41:29] <minijupe> Most people have used lightbox (I"m doing soimething else)
[12:41:34] <rue> SixThreeOh: Using dotjs? I just disabled JS altogether.
[12:41:45] <rue> Re: 'pedia
[12:42:03] <minijupe> but imagine that I got the string <a rel='lightbox'>blah</a> via ajax and stuck it in my page
[12:42:06] <xp_prg2> minijupe well, ajax is invoked and has a callback function that is usually used to modify html dom elements on the page
[12:42:31] <minijupe> the lightbox library looks for rel='lightbox' and applies functionality ON PAGE LOAD
[12:43:01] <minijupe> but since this content was added after page load, then it won't have that funcitonality. How to i trigger this with dyamic content coming from ajax?
[12:43:29] <xp_prg2> minijupe what is the event you want to trigger the ajax call with?
[12:45:18] <Spockz`> I'm trying to use the deferred object / method with functions that might not terminate but are very busy
[12:45:37] <Spockz`> however, my function that is set as reset function is never called
[12:46:42] <xp_prg2> Spockz` wouldn't you want to use a web worker?
[12:47:14] <Spockz`> xp_prg2: I have looked into that but it requires me to create a separate JS file and I cannot pass it functions
[12:48:37] <xp_prg2> hmm... ok
[12:48:46] <xp_prg2> I don't know about this deferred object approach
[12:49:06] <danzik17> Spockz`: do you have a jsfiddle/demo?
[12:49:22] <Spockz`> danzik17: I'm composing one now (the js code + demo)
[12:49:29] <Spockz`> I don't know about jsfiddle
[12:50:00] <danzik17> jsfiddle is the preferred way to share demos in here - makes it easy to tinker with sample code and give suggestions.
[12:51:06] <Spockz`> danzik17: https://gist.github.com/94884dd3c6d588e1c704 this is the code anyhow
[12:51:12] <Spockz`> let me look into jsfiddle
[12:51:28] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/uduBKkhX - I can't get this to work either
[12:51:41] <gataraid> would someone mind pointing me maybe in the right direction, a tutorial, codex, guide or something.
[12:52:23] <Spockz`> danzik17: oh dear, I can't close the jsfiddle tab
[12:52:25] <gataraid> maybe show me what I am doing wrong or what is wrong.  I don't want the answer, I'd like to know how to accomplish it more.
[12:53:01] <Spockz`> danzik17: http://jsfiddle.net/WjRKC/ << beware with the run
[12:53:05] <jeffsmykil> WTF you have to give your rep all of your contact information in order to email them?
[12:55:23] <danzik17> Spockz`: well, it froze because of the while(true){}.  JS is single threaded, so something like that is always gonna freeze the browser.  what do you actually want it to do?
[12:55:56] <Spockz`> danzik17: instead of the while I have a computation that might show the same behavior
[12:56:05] <Spockz`> and I want to set a time-out on that
[12:56:23] <danzik17> Spockz`: sure, but presumably this isn't some infinite calculation we're talking about?
[12:56:35] <Spockz`> danzik17: it's a possibly infinite calculation yes
[12:56:40] <Charliemo> so if  I delegate .live or bind I don't need to run .ready function right?
[12:56:45] <gataraid> please? would anybody mind?
[12:56:56] <Spockz`> danzik17: a proof checker for Prolog to be exact
[12:57:54] <danzik17> Spockz`: eh, i know nothing about prolog.  the important thing is - can you chunk the data?  the way to do this is to perform your calculation on a small chunk of data which in turn does a settimeout for the next chunk and so forth
[12:58:05] <danzik17> or use a webworker, but even with that you don't want to be a CPU hog.
[12:58:28] <Spockz`> danzik17: would a sleep work as well/
[12:59:10] <danzik17> no
[12:59:11] <luke--> is there a jquery method to call a (any) function after a delay? like setTimeout?
[12:59:58] <Spockz`> danzik17: and there is nothing like yield?
[13:00:15] <Spockz`> danzik17: sleep wouldn't work in a single threaded situation indeed
[13:00:20] <NoiseEee> luke--: you mean... setTimeout?
[13:00:26] <luke--> -_-
[13:01:03] <danzik17> Spockz`: not natively.  you can simulate it with settimeout.  dust.js might have an example of it ( streaming templates )
[13:01:16] <Spockz`> danzik17: but Deferred is only useful when you use it with something asynchronous like an ajax thing?
[13:01:49] <Spockz`> danzik17: or something that incorporates setTimeout
[13:02:12] <danzik17> Spockz`: right.  generally it's only useful with something thats not gonna immediately return
[13:02:14] <luke--> NoiseEee: setTimeout leaves the namespace I'm in so I'm losing access to the functions the timout'ed function is based on
[13:02:25] <SixThreeOh> luke-- http://api.jquery.com/delay/ ? jQuery might not implement something that does not vary too much from browser to browser.
[13:02:45] <SixThreeOh> If that is the case it will just extend the thing ith new functionality.
[13:03:30] <NoiseEee> luke--: you can $.proxy what you need
[13:03:42] <NoiseEee> luke--: or make a jsfiddle explaining your issue
[13:04:41] <Danielss89> Hi, i have some html in a variable… now i need to edit something, but if i do like this it doesn't edit it, but no errors either: $(html).find("#acceptMatchWinner").html(winner);
[13:05:03] <Danielss89> is that not the correct way of doing it?
[13:05:28] <gataraid> No worries
[13:05:31] <gataraid> I solved it myself
[13:05:32] <gataraid> :D
[13:05:49] <gataraid> Thanks anyway :P
[13:06:04] <ChrisPitzer> hey 'yall. I've got an app with multiple dialog boxes open at the same time. And the dialog boxes contain lists that are linked and sortable. So you can drag items from one dialog box to another. My problem is that the boxes resize and shift around randomly as you do this. any thoughts on how to keep that from happening?
[13:06:56] <luke--> NoiseEee: I just figured out I could wrap my functioncall in an anonymous function an keep my namespace
[13:07:03] <Spockz`> danzik17: I'm going to look at a web worker then
[13:07:48] <NoiseEee> luke--: sweet
[13:07:49] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/iTzQw0ds - worked great :D
[13:07:55] <gataraid> Thanks for ignoring me
[13:08:11] <ChrisPitzer> nm - figured it out. You can't stack the uls. you have to have them in containers so they wouldn't effect each other's position if they weren't in dialogs.
[13:08:14] <ChrisPitzer> *sigh*
[13:10:43] <Misiur> I need to do something like $('.elements').filter(':visible, :animated') , but filter doesn't accept comma separated values. How can I do it without broking a chain for if statement?
[13:10:48] <Misiur> *breaking
[13:11:54] <hypnoseal> I am trying to use an if statement that compares two variables.  Variable 1 is set by .length and variable two is an int that iterates ++ each time the function is performed.  The issue is that when I the boolean always comes out false when comparing the two variables.  It works when I use an actual integer in the if boolean.  Any ideas?  I've even tried parseInt() on the .length function
[13:12:29] <nwilson5> is there any form validation plugin that is well documented
[13:12:52] <derik> how i transform select menu into a li and keep js function http://pastehtml.com/view/bl6jlvbxn.html
[13:13:02] <SixThreeOh> hypnoseal: did you try in firebug?
[13:13:40] <hypnoseal> no I haven't I'll give it a shot.  I shoud use the console thing?
[13:13:42] <SixThreeOh> It sounds exactly like the sort of thing you want to use a debugger for.
[13:14:17] <SixThreeOh> Put a break point on the comparison line and you can just mouse over to see the variable values or do some more stuff in the console (put in the variable name to see the value).
[13:14:31] <Danielss89> what is the name of the website where you can try out javascript? it has 4 "frames" and can preload f.x. jquery
[13:14:39] <Danielss89> ok, it was in the topix
[13:14:44] <SixThreeOh> Bob the website?
[13:15:48] <SixThreeOh> hypnoseal: is the other variable initialised inside the function by any chance? Maybe it wants a this or in the higher scope or something.
[13:16:13] <freeed> Danielss89, jsfiddle.net
[13:16:34] <Danielss89> yeah saw the topic xD
[13:16:54] <hypnoseal> SixThreeOh: Both variables are initialized before the if statement
[13:17:28] <hypnoseal> firebug is telling me it's 0 when in fact it's five.  But when I do .length in console it comes up right.  Funky
[13:17:43] <Charliemo> so have this code http://pastebin.com/YfT10Nay
[13:17:47] <SixThreeOh> can you put the code up somewhere?
[13:17:52] <hypnoseal> Sure just a second
[13:18:01] <Charliemo> using delgate or trying to but not working

[13:23:11] <Charliemo_> am i back yet
[13:23:20] <armenianeagle> Hello All - I am trying to animate a sidebar to slide to the right off of another div. I have that working. However, once I animate it back, it adds both animations to the style attribute (style="right: 328px; left: 328px;") . Is there a way to reset the style attribute before the next iteration of animations?
[13:23:56] <Charliemo_> please?:-S
[13:24:13] <Robson> Hello... Somebody here ?
[13:24:30] <Charliemo_> I'm here
[13:24:42] <Danielss89> i have some html in a variable… now i need to edit something, but if i do like this it doesn't edit it, but no errors either: $(html).find("#acceptMatchWinner").html(winner);
[13:25:13] <Danielss89> and if i do: html =  $(html).find("#acceptMatchWinner").html(winner); <-- it's just empty
[13:25:22] <Robson> Hello Charliemo... Do you know did submit multiple forms using jquery and C# asp.net mvc 4 ?
[13:25:39] <Misiur> Round 2. Is there way to add callback on-fly? Like $('#element').show(2000); $('#element').addCallbackAfterAnimation(function(){ console.log('Just on time') ;})
[13:26:04] <Charliemo_> sorry no am newbie I'm afraid trying to find out about event delegation sorry
[13:26:15] <Robson> thanks
[13:26:49] <Robson> whats your problem with delegation... maybe i can help you
[13:27:05] <hobbelt> why wouldnt this work:     activDiv = $("#").contains("divID")
[13:27:15] <Danielss89> Misiur i think its  $('#element').show(2000, function(){ console.log(finished) });
[13:27:20] <SP33D> hi any one knows a img preview plugin that don't depends on a <a href linked to img?
[13:27:24] <Charliemo_> got the following code http://pastebin.com/YfT10Nay
[13:27:30] <Charliemo_> but not working
[13:27:35] <redsquare> hobbelt, explain what you want to do
[13:28:02] <Charliemo_> trying to read through everything about delegation but know I'm doing something wrong somewhere
[13:28:11] <vargadanis> hi! is there a way to "continue" an event after it has been stopped with stoppropagation?
[13:28:29] <redsquare> Charliemo_, streetview is not an element
[13:28:32] <Misiur> Danielss89: You're right, but I need to add callback a lot later in code, but not too late in time
[13:28:38] <hobbelt> redsquare: im trying to toggle a div with a certain ID, however there are multiple IDs in the ID field, therefor i need to match one
[13:28:42] <redsquare> no vargadanis
[13:28:57] <Robson> streetview must be a element with class named streetview..
[13:28:58] <vargadanis> redsquare, ok, i'll think of something
[13:28:59] <Charliemo_> it is in my html!!
[13:29:08] <Charliemo_> i have adiv named streetview
[13:29:11] <Robson> like this: <div class="streetview">
[13:29:11] <redsquare> hobbelt $("#") means nothing
[13:29:20] <Robson> sorry...
[13:29:22] <Charliemo_> which is parent to address
[13:29:27] <Robson> its not have a dot
[13:29:31] <hobbelt> redsquare so how can i tag a Div ID then? it works with a paragraph (p)
[13:29:46] <Danielss89> Misiur: why not call the show() there then?
[13:30:00] <redsquare> Charliemo_, have u got the div in a var?
[13:30:07] <Robson> your right... streetview must be a element..
[13:30:14] <Robson> i will try use it..
[13:30:19] <Robson> i'm back
[13:31:07] <ajpiano> Misiur: i have an example for you
[13:31:12] <nicholasschulz> Is there a way to detect WHAT element that was clicked? I have multiple divs that are going to use the same script when triggered, but I need a way to detect what element id that triggered
[13:31:13] <Charliemo_> sorry lost have div id streetview with no class
[13:31:32] <Charliemo_> then within that input id address again with no class
[13:31:48] <Charliemo_> so not sure what I need to do
[13:31:55] <ajpiano> Misiur: animations implement Deferreds/promises, so you can do this: http://jsfiddle.net/gjKmP/
[13:32:23] <hobbelt> redsquare : http://jsfiddle.net/JFNx9/ <-- can you give me a hint on rewriting thisone to "toggle DIV which has id= divID (and a few other id's)
[13:32:51] <Misiur> ajpiano: Awesome, thanks
[13:32:57] <redsquare> Charliemo_, if you have an id then you can just say $('#theId'), remember id's need to be unique
[13:33:11] <Charliemo_> redsquare: I'm sorry I don't know
[13:33:19] <Danielss89> ajpiano: you must know this: http://jsfiddle.net/SxXqE/3/ <-- how can i edit html inside a variable?
[13:34:11] <redsquare> Charliemo_, I am very confused
[13:34:29] <ajpiano> Danielss89: i have no idea what you're asking
[13:34:58] <nicholasschulz> hobbelt: did you find a solution to your prob?
[13:35:11] <Charliemo_> so in the code would it be $('#streetview').delegate('address', click etc
[13:35:13] <Danielss89> ajpiano: i have a variable.. in that i have some html.. Now i want to edit something in that html, and i want it edited in the variable
[13:35:26] <hobbelt> nicholasschulz nopez not yet, it keeps breaking on me, already tried :contains
[13:35:42] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: your code is a long way from being correct
[13:35:49] <Charliemo_> or delegate('#address', click
[13:35:59] <Charliemo_> or neither!?
[13:36:00] <nicholasschulz> hobbelt: You want to find what divID that is clicked, right?
[13:36:04] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: xD i know, but i can't figure out the correct way
[13:37:32] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: you should start with valid html
[13:37:36] <hobbelt> nicholasschulz divID follows from an onclick value. eg on button click "togglediv(div_1)" the script then looks for a div with id=div_1 and toggles it. However it doesnt work when the div contains multiple ID
[13:38:30] <hobbelt> nicholasschulz so instead of id=divID it should look for id contains divID (word), however the function contains: fails
[13:38:32] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: why isn't it valid? :P
[13:38:51] <Charliemo_> yippeee thankyou guys it was just that i missed out # in the id's
[13:38:52] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: bad wrapping on your <div>s, for one
[13:39:03] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: s/wrapping/nesting
[13:39:14] <nicholasschulz> hobbelt: Ok, i see.. think we have a bit of the same problem.. let me know if you find any solution
[13:39:19] <Charliemo_> fixed it :-):-d
[13:39:31] <Danielss89> NoiseEee hehe well, it was just a quick example :P it could have been span tags inside the first div as well :)
[13:39:48] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: start with valid html, then we'll go on
[13:39:52] <Danielss89> ok
[13:40:03] <hobbelt> nicholasschulz oki, let me know if you fixed it. I pasted it here: http://jsfiddle.net/JFNx9/1/
[13:40:58] <nicholasschulz> hobbelt: ypu
[13:41:00] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/SxXqE/4/
[13:41:01] <nicholasschulz> yup*
[13:43:30] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: now, what do you want to do?  replace everything in <div class='test'> or, change the content of <span>s within it?
[13:43:53] <Danielss89> i want to change the content of span2 to "hi"
[13:44:17] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: that should be easy enough. what makes you think you need your first line in the function?
[13:45:18] <Mullie> Hello
[13:45:45] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: compare yours with http://jsfiddle.net/SxXqE/8/
[13:45:50] <Mullie> Please tell me a popular/well used slideshow with support for pager and next/prev-links :)
[13:46:06] <Danielss89> Well my real code has a div which is a holder of something which i then take and show in a dialog.. then i might remove that dialog, get some new info, and use the info from the div as a base once again
[13:46:47] <andrew9183> Danielss89: the problem with your code is that the divs are nested
[13:47:21] <NoiseEee> andrew9183: yeah not anymore
[13:48:26] <Danielss89> i'll paste my real example :D
[13:48:51] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: you should be able to figure out what to do based on my example, you had so much... messy stuff doing nothing
[13:52:29] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: http://jsfiddle.net/SxXqE/9/ <-- maybe this explains it better
[13:53:14] <Tomasso> grg $(document).ready is not working... jquery is included.. and no javascripts errors are shown.. what could be the problem? i dont want to use documen.onload
[13:53:15] <Mullie> Anyone?
[13:53:26] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: right, so there you've got an example thats pretty much nothing like what you started with
[13:53:51] <redsquare> ? paste @ Tomasso
[13:53:51] <bot-t> Tomasso, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:54:05] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: it seems like you don't really know JS or haven't bothered to learn jquery really?
[13:54:08] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: yeah i know :D well, its a bit the same :D i have a variable and need to edit some html inside it :P
[13:54:42] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: addClass("{'game':"+game+"}");  ?
[13:54:53] <Danielss89> metadata
[13:55:55] <NoiseEee> that doesnt mean anything to me
[13:55:56] <Mullie> What do you use for slideshows?
[13:56:39] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: thats not how you use addClass() at all.  http://api.jquery.com/addClass/
[13:57:40] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: i use the metadataplugin, and it gets the data from the class.. class="{'key':'value'}"
[13:57:51] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: want to use "metadata"?  use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.data/
[13:58:21] <NoiseEee> Danielss89: sounds awful.  anyways... i don't see anything in your code that suggests you want to show new content
[13:58:22] <NoiseEee> good luck!!
[13:58:57] <Danielss89> NoiseEee: thx
[14:01:58] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i got this error i get only in FF. Works fine in IE (wow). They told me on here yesterday that it could be cache that didn't clear but not it keeps giving me the same thing again and always on the same line.
[14:01:59] <Mullie> Anyone that have used jquery cycle?
[14:02:48] <ThemNuts> the script it is happening in: http://pastebin.com/Ue9QrvUH
[14:03:14] <ThemNuts> always on line 55. When i change the code up a line or down a line, the error stays at line 55 saying undefined
[14:04:03] <ThemNuts> and only happens after i change the code (add or remove lines). Any sollution? Already installed the "clear cache button" add-on and closed browser / restarted pc
[14:04:07] <ThemNuts> still happening
[14:06:58] <Charliemo_> so am debugging and keep getting 404 not found for jquery.plugin.js anyone lese had this isse?
[14:07:24] <Charliemo_> what and where is jquery.plugin.js
[14:07:53] <Charliemo_> tried google to no real avail found a post with link to dwnload but not there anymore
[14:13:14] <nicholasschulz> Uhm, why doesn't this fiddle work when I paste it onto a new file? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/6Qqxq/14/ -> http://bannaky.com/test.php
[14:13:43] <nicholasschulz> No errors showing in Chrome
[14:14:45] <NoiseEee> nicholasschulz: your script is referring to elements that don't exist yet
[14:15:06] <NoiseEee> nicholasschulz: either put your script before </body> or use http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:16:14] <nicholasschulz> NoiseEee: Thanks a lot :-)
[14:16:41] <Blaster> Hey guys, I'm trying to get the value of a checkbox on submit, but I'm having some trouble.. Please check out my JSFiddle and click submit, it alerts "on" no matter if the checkbox is selected or not: http://jsfiddle.net/ejadu/
[14:19:12] <gurde> hello
[14:20:27] <gurde> i have 2 sets $('.list1') and $('.list2') how can i mergem them and putem inside a ul? like $('ul#myid').html(merged_lists)?
[14:20:39] <Spockz`> is there an alternative to the JS new keyword? something like to Worker.prototype.create(arg)?
[14:23:39] <epitron_> is there a way to check "mousedown" status directly? without a callback?
[14:24:01] <epitron_> or do i have to register a mouse handler, and set some flag variable?
[14:24:38] <ringotwo> i believe the latter, but not 100% sure
[14:24:38] <NoiseEee> epitron_: you have to specify a part of the DOM to check when an event happens on it, if thats what you're asking
[14:25:05] <ringotwo> there's no global variable that tells you if the mouse is down
[14:25:17] <epitron_> NoiseEee: the problem i'm having is that, i'm refreshing a page continuously... and if a refresh happens while a user is clicking something, the click is lost
[14:25:36] <NoiseEee> epitron_: when a refresh is happening, all scripts are gone
[14:25:36] <epitron_> NoiseEee: so a solution i'm thinking of is, "don't update if the mouse is in the middle of clicking"
[14:25:43] <epitron_> no no
[14:25:46] <epitron_> a dynamic refresh
[14:25:53] <epitron_> not aRELOAD
[14:26:03] <NoiseEee> epitron_: so then yes, your solution would work
[14:26:06] <ringotwo> that won't fix the problem tho
[14:26:15] <ringotwo> because the refresh could have happened right before the click
[14:26:24] <NoiseEee> ^^ that too
[14:26:25] <epitron_> true.. :)
[14:26:32] <epitron_> oy!
[14:26:34] <NoiseEee> consider the mouse is 'down' for only a fraction of a second
[14:26:41] <ringotwo> why do you have to constantly refresh?
[14:26:55] <epitron_> well, because i'm too lazy to implement websockets
[14:27:00] <epitron_> and this is an app running on a lan :)
[14:27:05] <epitron_> so it's not really a big deal
[14:27:10] <NoiseEee> socket.io = be as lazy as you want
[14:27:13] <NoiseEee> www.socket.io
[14:27:13] <ringotwo> socket.io.js library is pretty easy to use
[14:27:17] <ringotwo> from my experience
[14:27:21] <epitron_> hurrr
[14:27:31] <ringotwo> easier than your solution
[14:27:33] <epitron_> my whole program is already designed this way though
[14:27:42] <epitron_> i'd have to change the whole serverside thing
[14:27:53] <ringotwo> you right
[14:27:54] <epitron_> all i want to do is fix the clicky problem
[14:28:39] <ringotwo> can you refresh just a part of the page instead of the whole thing?
[14:28:53] <epitron_> the part that's refreshing has links in it
[14:29:00] <ringotwo> like a <div> container instead of loading and unloading the whole thing?
[14:29:10] <epitron_> the links change depending on state on the server
[14:29:17] <epitron_> so they need to be updated
[14:29:40] <ringotwo> so just update the links then? why unload all the scripts?
[14:29:51] <epitron_> i'm not unloading scripts
[14:30:03] <epitron_> i'm updating the body of the page
[14:30:14] <ringotwo> oh, i see
[14:30:48] <epitron_> it's a small body, so don't worry :)
[14:31:12] <ringotwo> you could refresh one link at a time
[14:31:22] <ringotwo> but would require some refactoring
[14:31:43] <epitron_> wouldn't that still cause the clicky problem if you were clicking that one link?
[14:32:09] <ringotwo> the refresh for a single link would be a lot less than dropping the body contents and rewriting it
[14:32:19] <ringotwo> yeah, sure, it could be a tiny bit of an issue
[14:32:47] <ringotwo> but i wouldn't think it would be a common case, unless it's a high traffic site where the links are constantly gtetting clicked
[14:32:56] <epitron_> o_O
[14:33:10] <ringotwo> how many links?
[14:33:13] <epitron_> okay so it's refreshing once a second
[14:33:27] <epitron_> and it frequently happens that you click on a refresh-edge
[14:33:34] <epitron_> the refresh is very quick, because it's on a lan
[14:33:41] <whoever_> i am having a problem with location.href, when i click  a button i should get a dowload prompt and noting happens i have checked to make sure the link is  correct and location.href = string + var +string;  but when i click the button i get noting. can someone assist ?
[14:34:06] <epitron_> but the problem is the user takes a while to click :)
[14:34:09] <ringotwo> jeez, if it really has to happen that often, maybe you should refactor
[14:34:13] <epitron_> so that tends to stride a refresh
[14:34:57] <epitron_> that is a good long-term decision
[14:35:03] <epitron_> i may consider it
[14:35:19] <ringotwo> you could add a class on mousedown that prevents the refresh
[14:35:29] <ringotwo> and on mouseup you could remove the class
[14:35:39] <ringotwo> the refresh looks for a classname before actually refreshing
[14:35:40] <epitron_> add a class? couldn't i just set a variable?
[14:35:46] <ringotwo> sure
[14:35:53] <gurde> if my ajax request returns html as string how can i take out a part of it by css selector?
[14:36:13] <ringotwo> you can do that -- i've done that sort of thing before
[14:36:38] <ringotwo> you might want to add some checking that releases the lock if the page gets in a bad state
[14:36:48] <ringotwo> say someone holds the mouse down and drags off the screen
[14:37:01] <ringotwo> you might not get the mouse up event, and your page will be in a bad state
[14:37:25] <ringotwo> you can add something to the 1-second interval that makes sure the lock hasn't gone on for more than a few seconds
[14:39:26] <paupl> Hi Everyone. If i have a string (its returned from an ajax call) that contains a block of html e.g. template = "<div id='container'><div id='child1'></div></div>" is there a way to treat that text like a collection of DOM elements? I tried $(template).find('#container').html() without success
[14:39:30] <ringotwo> gurde: what does the html look like that you want to extract? post on jsfiddle or similar
[14:40:24] <khmer> paupl: jquerify it! just wrap it in $()
[14:40:26] <gurde> ringotwo: the returned content is a html page <html><head><body><div id="test">.... and i want to get the div with the test id
[14:41:05] <ringotwo> $(string).find('#test').html()
[14:41:20] <epitron_> ringotwo: a lock timeout is a good idea
[14:41:29] <gurde> and that will do what?
[14:41:42] <gurde> ah
[14:41:42] <ringotwo> that will get the inner html for div id=test
[14:41:44] <gurde> got it
[14:41:52] <gurde> i'll test it
[14:41:54] <gurde> :D
[14:42:18] <ringotwo> epitron: yeah, that sounds good
[14:42:22] <ringotwo> good luck
[14:42:24] <epitron_> ringotwo: i'm just looking at the $().load method here... is there something that fires more events? like... before/after?
[14:42:52] <epitron_> it only seems to fire once the load is successful
[14:42:56] <DofLeFou> Why would I be getting an "unterminated string literal" error with the following https://gist.github.com/1636284
[14:43:17] <paupl> it looks like a couple of us are asking the same question here
[14:43:26] <paupl> $(string).find('#test').html()    doesn't work
[14:43:39] <paupl> if i alert string it shows all the html
[14:43:42] <ringotwo> epitron: not following, what are you trying to do?
[14:43:54] <paupl> but if i try to alert $(string).find('#test').html() its null
[14:44:21] <ringotwo> try $(string).clone().find('#test').html()
[14:44:24] <epitron_> ringotwo: well, i want to check the mouse state after the load has completed, and NOT insert the content if the mouse is down
[14:44:37] <epitron_> load doesn't give you that option
[14:45:11] <ringotwo> i think you have to check the mouse state during the 1-second interval routine that is being run, right?
[14:45:40] <ringotwo> load() only runs once, when the DOM and all page contents are loaded
[14:45:46] <paupl> ringtwo: still null
[14:45:49] <DofLeFou> Anyone ? Why would I be getting an "unterminated string literal" error with the following https://gist.github.com/1636284
[14:46:32] <ringotwo> you need to check that the mouse state isn't locked every second, before you run the refresh command
[14:47:06] <ringotwo> and every link on the page has to have set or unset the lock variable
[14:47:20] <ringotwo> *has to set or unset
[14:47:26] <astropirate> DofLeFou, You can't have multilined  string in Javascript
[14:47:48] <ringotwo> paupl: if you can post the code, i cna have a look
[14:48:26] <paupl> ringotwo: thanks mate..
[14:48:27] <paupl>         $.ajax({             url: templatePath,             dataType: 'html',             async: false,             success: function(response){                 alert (response);                 alert ($(response).find('#template_wrapper').html());             }         })
[14:48:37] <DofLeFou> changes my append content to inside a "  "
[14:49:04] <astropirate> DofLeFou, doesn't matter,  JS doesn't support strings on multiple lines the way PHP does
[14:49:09] <DofLeFou> astropirate" ^^^ I m putting it inside a """
[14:49:22] <paupl> alert(response) gives me the all the html I have pulled in, and the next line gives me null
[14:49:38] <epitron_> ringotwo: no, $("#div").load(url)... not the load event
[14:49:49] <epitron_> the thing that dynamically replaces html
[14:50:32] <DofLeFou> everything has to be in one line
[14:51:55] <epitron_> ringotwo: found it!

[15:00:13] <mathi> hi
[15:00:27] <mathi> how is it possible to insert an image into a div dynamically?
[15:01:03] <someprimetime> @ mathi http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[15:01:06] <nicholasschulz> math prepend, load, get ..
[15:01:13] <nicholasschulz> mathi*
[15:01:14] <someprimetime> and what nicholasschulz said
[15:02:47] <ringotwo> paupl: if you post the html and js, i can have a look
[15:03:34] <paupl> Thanks mate
[15:03:38] <paupl> ill paste them in now
[15:04:07] <paupl> the html returned is <div id='template_wrapper' class='template_wrapper'><div class='container'> <div id='header'></div><div id='main_body'>Some text in this bad boy</div><div id='footer'></div></div> </div>
[15:04:19] <ringotwo> epitron: did you figure out the load() issue
[15:04:28] <paupl> and the JS
[15:04:32] <pixelhandler> nicholasschulz yeah that should work, sometimes if there are a lot of elements inside the div with the click handler you can add $(event.target).closest(".someClass").attr('id')
[15:04:48] <paupl>         $.ajax({ url: templatePath,  dataType: 'html',  async: false, success: function(response){ alert (response);  alert ($(response).find('#template_wrapper').html()); } })
[15:05:13] <paupl> alert(response) gives me back all that html, but the next line gives me null
[15:05:24] <ringotwo> paupl, did you try the clone() like i posted beofre
[15:05:44] <paupl> yes i did
[15:05:47] <nicholasschulz> pixelhandler: when I print the var it says "Undefined"
[15:05:47] <paupl> same result
[15:06:10] <ringotwo> did you clear your cache first?
[15:06:26] <ringotwo> are you sure the javascript updated?
[15:09:14] <Wiz_KeeD> can someone suggest a site preloader?
[15:09:20] <Wiz_KeeD> with a custom image would be preffered
[15:10:16] <paupl> ringtwo: sorry, were those last two questions to me?
[15:14:20] <Wiz_KeeD> can someone suggest a site preloader?
[15:18:16] <ringotwo> paupl: yes
[15:20:21] <paupl> ringotwo: I hadn't cleared my cache, but I just did and tried it again. Same result
[15:20:42] <paupl> and my JS had updated
[15:22:51] <ringotwo> paupl: sorry, i think you don't need find() at all
[15:23:48] <ringotwo> can you try:  alert( $(response).html() );
[15:25:03] <paupl> ringotwo: undefined
[15:28:02] <nicholasschulz> Why don't this work???? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/UB3ZL/1/
[15:28:12] <nicholasschulz> The var is Undefined ?
[15:29:55] <ringotwo> paupl, i'm not sure what is going on. you might try setting ' dataType: "html" ' as an option in you $.ajax call
[15:31:04] <paupl> ringotwo: sorry, my misatke. alert ($(response).html()); does work
[15:31:08] <paupl> (typo)
[15:31:16] <ringotwo> oh cool
[15:32:06] <ringotwo> nicholasschulz:    var clickedId = $(this).attr('id');
[15:32:13] <paupl> but I still can't use .find()
[15:32:20] <Zzaichik> nicholasschulz: replacing $(event.target) with simply $(this) works just fine.
[15:33:01] <paupl> (I really appreciate you taking the time by the way)
[15:33:05] <paupl> (thanks)
[15:33:11] <ringotwo> np
[15:33:25] <nicholasschulz> Thanks ringotwo and zzaichik
[15:34:23] <ringotwo> paupl: i don't know, i would try setting a var = the html
[15:34:31] <ringotwo> then examine the variable in firebug debugger
[15:34:34] <paupl> oh no, i got it. im an idiot
[15:34:36] <ringotwo> console.log()
[15:34:39] <paupl> super idiot
[15:34:54] <ringotwo> super
[15:35:02] <paupl> i think i should get a shirt that warns people what an idiot i am
[15:35:09] <ringotwo> ha ha
[15:35:17] <paupl> in case they want to come and ask me for directions or something
[15:36:46] <paupl> the origional issue of $(string).find(#topelement).html() failed (im guessing) because that top most element isn't returned. just its children
[15:37:02] <paupl> (as i can see from $(string).html() )
[15:37:22] <paupl> and find DOES work, i was looking for an id when I should have been looking for a class
[15:37:51] <ProLoser|Work> using $.ajax() is my data ALWAYS stringified?
[15:38:00] <ProLoser|Work> if i use $_POST does it keep it as separate entities?
[15:39:48] <ringotwo> ProLoser: you can specify dataType as an option with $.ajax
[15:40:39] <grantg> hey jqueryists. :P
[15:41:34] <ProLoser|Work> ringotwo: does $.ajax always submit strings via post? or can it pass an object literal or something?
[15:43:33] <ringotwo> you can specify method (GET, POST etc.) as part of the call. i think you can submit data in any way you like
[15:43:49] <ddoom> Is there a way to scroll a page up or down say 50px using jQuery or Javascript directly?
[15:44:14] <ProLoser|Work> so if it doesn't have to be json, or stringified, how is it sent?
[15:44:38] <ringotwo> ddoom: you want to use an animation effect with scrollTop
[15:45:13] <ringotwo> you specify the data in the $.ajax() data parameter
[15:46:04] <ringotwo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[15:46:42] <ringotwo> accepts arrays, objects, strings
[15:53:05] <nicholasschulz> How can I make a general script that hides the overlay on all others than the one clicked last? http://bannaky.com/test.php
[15:55:37] <ringotwo> nicholasschulz: please explain more, i don't understand
[15:56:35] <nicholasschulz> You see when you click the different books, a "overlay" pops up. If you have clicked book#1 and then click book#2 I want the book#1-overlay to disappear.
[15:57:05] <ringotwo> generally, if you give all the overlays the same class name, you can just hide all of them first, then show the one you want to show
[15:57:20] <ringotwo> $('.overlay').hide(); $('#overlay1').show()
[15:57:39] <ringotwo> the overlays aren't working for me in firefox
[15:58:17] <nicholasschulz> ringotwo: Works in FF here. what version?
[15:59:46] <ringotwo> oh, i see
[15:59:55] <ringotwo> the overlays are small :-)
[16:00:04] <ringotwo> i thought you meant an overlay on the whole page
[16:00:30] <nicholasschulz> ah, no ;-) just a little pop-up kinda thing :-)
[16:00:54] <nicholasschulz> Thanks for your tip :-) works like a charm
[16:01:00] <ringotwo> just like i said above
[16:01:08] <ringotwo> $('.book-info').hide();
[16:01:32] <ringotwo> cool
[16:18:02] <Advocated> Hi there, is there a way to style <divs> i.e make them just look more jquery UI like/styled? can't find any examples of just doing that?
[16:18:33] <nicholasschulz> Sometimes its just like the JS doesn't update when I reload the page?? do I have to delete the cache?
[16:19:56] <nicholasschulz> Advocated : Do you mean CSS ?
[16:20:07] <nicholasschulz> .-p
[16:20:51] <someprimetime> whoop whoop 40 more min until my productivity is lost again
[16:20:57] <someprimetime> wrong channel sorry
[16:24:37] <tgp1994> Hi everyone. I'm using the Superfish menu module in joomla (I'm hoping someone may be able to help here, the
[16:25:24] <tgp1994> #joomla channel is rather quiet at the moment), but the superfish menus are no longer hiding. Something has changed, causing the properties to be removed from the <ul> tags of the menus. Does anyone know what could have removed these properties, causing them to show up?
[16:25:41] <someprimetime> wtf is superfish?
[16:25:45] <Advocated> nicholasschulz, yeah but i mean, using jquerys ui?
[16:26:00] <tgp1994> someprimetime: Superfish menus, a module for joomla heavily based off of jquery.
[16:26:46] <nicholasschulz> advocated: I'm not sure what you're talking about., if your doing style you use css .. you can set css attributes with jQuery if that helps you
[16:27:38] <tgp1994> Sorry, forgot to mention, my site's url is http://comets.firstobjective.org.
[16:27:49] <Advocated> nicholasschulz, i mean, when you use jquery UI it styles elements right? i know its using the css, like ui-widget etc, and in wondering what I can use for divs..
[16:30:59] <nicholasschulz> advocated: http://jqueryui.com/docs/Theming
[16:31:53] <relix> hi guys, is there a way to "chain" selectors? i.e. I've got a function that returns a jQuery collection of elements, and I want all the a-tags in those elmenets

[16:40:57] <starkid> hi there..:!! someone use a datetimepicker
[16:41:37] <vladikoff> starkid, yes, what is your issue with the jquery ui datepicker?
[16:42:12] <starkid> [vladikoff] mmmm... may be but i need to create a backlist how i cant do that...
[16:42:47] <tom[]> is there a data picker that works anything like this time picker: http://labs.perifer.se/timedatepicker/
[16:42:55] <starkid> mmm. for example the user only can select the follow days 22,25,30
[16:43:02] <paupl> Hey lads. I am playing with some HTML in string (returned from $.ajax());  I have taken out the portion I want and passed it back to my page. I now need to add an ID attribute to an element in the string.      $(template).children('.container').attr('id','form');      doesn't do anything, but if I   $('body').append(template)       then I am able to    $('body').children('.container').attr('id', 'boatLicense');
[16:43:18] <paupl> i really need to add that id *before* i append it to the body of the page though
[16:43:31] <paupl> anyone have any idea why that wouldn't be working?
[16:43:38] <starkid> and the same way to the hour.. f.e. only the 22 day between 0:00 and 13:00
[16:43:47] <tom[]> starkid: i was thinking of one that allows direct entry as well as selection
[16:44:03] <starkid> :/
[16:44:17] <tom[]> the number of months in a year is not too large for a dropdown
[16:44:25] <tom[]> neither is the number of days in a month
[16:44:28] <starkid> i can do hourMax:{
[16:44:38] <starkid> i can do hourMax:[0,13,10]
[16:46:27] <starkid> mmmm... im using datimepicker js
[16:47:45] <someprimetime> so i'm dynamically resizing an <ul> once the page loads. sometimes the width is 140
[16:47:48] <someprimetime> other times it's 540
[16:47:50] <someprimetime> it should always be 540
[16:48:04] <someprimetime> are there any known quirks to doing an on the fly resize like this?
[16:48:06] <someprimetime> that i should be aware of
[16:55:20] <kylevanleuven> can anyone help me with a pretty simple Jquery thing. I cant find it anywhere. I need it to show the div only if a certain value is selected in the drop down box. http://pastebin.com/yet4MHGm
[16:55:24] <kylevanleuven> It would be greatl appreciated

[17:07:08] <kristofer91> hello
[17:07:22] <kristofer91> Could anyone help me with getting my swf video that's on my site, to play only on hover
[17:07:40] <kristofer91> And i have tryed every event on jquery api i just cant get it to work
[17:08:39] <alexr2> kristofer91, make an overlay over the swf and use that as your base for the hover event
[17:09:25] <alexr2> you can't use javascript to access events entering and leaving swf
[17:09:27] <red_square> brdude are you using version 1.7+
[17:09:42] <kristofer91> i have a jquery plugin that plays
[17:09:43] <kristofer91> the swf
[17:09:47] <kristofer91> i want a jquery function
[17:09:52] <kristofer91> to display that video on hover
[17:09:55] <kristofer91> shouldnt that be possible
[17:10:04] <kristofer91> or display the div
[17:10:06] <kristofer91> that contains the video
[17:10:23] <alexr2> show some code http://www.jfiddle.net
[17:10:25] <kristofer91> I use Jquery Media plugin
[17:10:31] <alexr2> err http://www.jsfiddle.net
[17:10:50] <JakeSays> hey anyone know how to fix error "no transport" in IE9?
[17:11:05] <JakeSays> i get that error when i make an ajax request
[17:11:19] <JakeSays> same protocol/port/domain
[17:11:24] <JakeSays> and it works fine in chrome
[17:11:53] <red_square> JakeSays you sure everything is the same
[17:12:14] <JakeSays> yeah. the
[17:12:15] <brdude> red_square, I justfigured out that I have 2 versions of jQuery, one embebeded with the e-com package (jQuery 1.3) and the one I addedv(jQuery 1.7.1) now I have to figure out if I can safely replace the old version withough breaking anything.
[17:12:38] <kristofer91> http://jsfiddle.net/KC4Tx/
[17:12:41] <kristofer91> this is the code
[17:12:45] <kristofer91> i need to display on hover
[17:14:18] <JakeSays> red_square: eh, well hell. works fine against one server but not another
[17:14:20] <alexr2> what jquery plugin?
[17:14:28] <someprimetime> what is media()?
[17:14:31] <kristofer91> jquery media plugin
[17:14:46] <someprimetime> what a weird plugin
[17:14:56] <kristofer91> well if you have a better one please recommand
[17:15:04] <red_square> JakeSays that error is a catch all - could be a few things
[17:15:05] <kristofer91> i'm getting really tired of trying :/
[17:15:44] <starkid> mmmm... how i can create a range of date an time.. :(
[17:20:40] <kristofer91> Do you know of any other plugins i could use ?
[17:25:36] <ringotwo> you can use swfobject library for showing swfs
[17:25:50] <ringotwo> that's kind of the standard, right?
[17:26:16] <ringotwo> kristofer91 ^
[17:26:53] <kristofer91> yes, i'm taking a look at it,
[17:31:49] <ringotwo> starkid: what are you trying to do?
[17:32:35] <starkid> [ringotwo] well.. i wanna set a date an hour only between a range.. :$
[17:32:37] <ringotwo> jquery UI has a good datepicker
[17:32:54] <starkid> [ringotwo] im using a datetimepicker
[17:33:16] <paupl> Hey lads, i have some html in a string. If i append it to the body of my page $('body').append(htmlString);  I can then go     $('body').children('#divIdFromInsideString').attr('id', 'myID').  What I need to do is go $(htmlString).children('divIdFromInsideString').attr('id','myID);
[17:33:28] <paupl> but that doesn't work
[17:33:31] <paupl> any suggestions?
[17:33:38] <ringotwo> so you want a user to select a date, and then add an hour to it?
[17:34:05] <ringotwo> more info please, starkid
[17:34:21] <starkid> [ringotwo] the user select the date and the time with datetimepicker but only between a rango of hours.. :$
[17:34:55] * starkid inche ingles..!!! por que no puse mas antencion.. :P
[17:35:04] <ringotwo> having trouble visualizing
[17:35:21] <ringotwo> what does the form look like
[17:35:38] <ringotwo> they choose a date and then a time, and then what do you want to show after that?
[17:36:29] <starkid> only the date and time..!! but in the range..
[17:36:51] <starkid> example only since 9 to 10 and 12 and 14
[17:37:57] <ringotwo> so you have to take the form input date and time and convert it into a javascript date object
[17:38:32] <ringotwo> then if you want to show a range of hours, you have to add the number of hours to your date object
[17:38:59] <ringotwo> and convert the times into form elements
[17:39:23] <ringotwo> it's not that easy to do, you have to read tutorials or blogs about it
[17:40:42] <starkid> :(
[17:41:10] <ringotwo> read about the javascript date object
[17:41:20] <ringotwo> you can learn how to add two hours or four hours to the current time
[17:41:25] <ringotwo> not that hard
[17:42:08] <ringotwo> paupl: $('body').children('irc://irc.freenode.net/#divIdFromInsideString').attr('id', 'myID')
[17:42:14] <ringotwo> doesn't make sense
[17:43:29] <ringotwo> can you even put an argument like that in for children()?
[17:43:51] <ringotwo> also, why would you set all the children's IDs to the same value\
[17:43:53] <ringotwo> that would be illegal
[17:45:21] <kaneda^> hey guys
[17:45:39] <kaneda^> i'm having an issue with IE where it seems to cache a table, so even though I'm erasing and redrawing it it shows the old table
[17:45:46] <kaneda^> i dont have this issue on FF or chrome
[17:46:00] <kaneda^> i've even put some meta tags in to stop it from caching, to no avail
[17:46:17] <dilvie> You're erasing the table with JavaScript?
[17:46:26] <dilvie> Or on the server?
[17:46:32] <paupl> ringotwo:   $('body').children('#divID').attr('newAttribute','newAttributeValue');   <- When I run it it grabs the child of body with an id of divID and gives it a new attribute
[17:46:36] <kaneda^> i'm going it with js
[17:46:39] <kaneda^> doing
[17:47:10] <dilvie> Kaneda: have you used the debugger to verify that JavaScript has the correct data to draw?
[17:47:19] <kaneda^> dilvie, yes
[17:47:26] <paupl> ringotwo: but i think i have my answer now, var dummy = $('<div />').html(myHtmlStrin);     <-- create a dummy div to put my html in, and I can manipulate it there.
[17:47:46] <dilvie> Kaneda^: Have you used the debugger to be sure that the JavaScript is actually drawing to the DOM?
[17:47:51] <kaneda^> dilvie, and when i clear my cache and refresh the page the correct data is loaded into the table
[17:47:57] <ringotwo> nice
[17:48:07] <kaneda^> dilvie, i ran the results through a validation tool
[17:48:54] <dilvie> kaneda^: I'm going to take that as a "no"
[17:50:40] <dilvie> kaneda^: The results of JavaScript DOM manipulation don't get cached (unless you explicitly cache DOM nodes in memory using JavaScript), so if the JS has the correct data, what you're left with is that the DOM is not getting written correctly.
[17:51:17] <kaneda^> why does it work on ff and chrome then?
[17:51:28] <ringotwo> you might be getting an IE-only error
[17:51:45] <dilvie> because FF and Chrome are different browsers with different sensitivities to various errors.
[17:51:59] <ringotwo> are you seeing any errors in the IE dev window?
[17:52:49] <ringotwo> also, what versions of IE are you testing?
[17:53:03] <kaneda^> ringotwo, there's nothing in the logs :/
[17:53:59] <ringotwo> the only thing to do is use the IE debugger
[17:54:02] <kaneda^> i use it
[17:54:09] <ringotwo> set a few breakpoints and step through line by line
[17:54:23] <kaneda^> there are no errors X_X
[17:54:40] <ringotwo> just step through it line by line, you do'nt have to see any errors
[17:54:42] <dilvie> kaneda^: did you step through?
[17:55:32] <ringotwo> if you step through each line, you'll see that either the code is not getting called, or it's doing something unexpected
[17:55:43] <dilvie> the free Visual Studio Express has a better debugger than the one built into IE. You might want to take a look.
[17:56:18] <ringotwo> IE8 and 9 have built in javascript debugger and console
[17:56:35] <ringotwo> and you can simulate IE7 and IE6 as well
[17:57:04] <ringotwo> so you should be able to reproduce an IE6-only bug in IE8+
[18:11:57] <kaneda^> so
[18:12:05] <kaneda^> IE doesn't have a tbody huh...
[18:21:19] <riyonuk> If you click on any of the headings on the page, it will collapse into an accordion. How would I make it already collapsed on page load? I already did a document.ready :/ - http://www.mauropilates.com/sessions/

[18:27:07] <abjorn> NM YO
[18:27:07] <abjorn> SICK
[18:27:11] <abjorn> HOME SICK TODAY
[18:27:17] <imsky> i have been doing math and writing code all day bro!!!
[18:27:21] <abjorn> my sister needs to stop giving me her day care diseases
[18:27:24] <imsky> i'm hankering for some vodka
[18:27:28] <abjorn> lol
[18:27:44] <kaneda^> hmm
[18:27:46] <imsky> sopa's pretty pimp
[18:27:51] <kaneda^> dilvie, could you take a look at my delete method?
[18:27:52] <imsky> reference.com is now my new page
[18:27:57] <imsky> for reference needs
[18:28:50] <kaneda^> dilvie, http://pastie.org/3211117 <-- this works in IE, only when i redraw it seems to remembe the old values
[18:29:03] <kaneda^> dilvie, i think i may try zeroing out the values before calling redraw, see what happens
[18:29:26] <abjorn> lul
[18:29:40] <imsky> abjorn: what are you sick with
[18:29:42] <abjorn> cold
[18:29:48] <imsky> in tejas?
[18:29:52] <imsky> what a pansy
[18:30:05] <abjorn> just cause they call it a cold doesn't mean it has to be cold to get one
[18:30:15] <imsky> that's deep
[18:30:20] <imsky> you should run for government
[18:30:21] <abjorn> fasho
[18:30:24] <dilvie> kaneda^: what's your draw function look like?
[18:30:34] <kaneda^> dilvie, i'll paste that, one sec
[18:30:41] <imsky> abjorn: it's 2 weeks til you get that jerb upgrade, right?
[18:31:32] <kaneda^> dilvie, http://pastie.org/private/rmxolye8fcfmnohxpbkg
[18:32:30] <kaneda^> hm
[18:33:20] <imsky> Winkey-"internet" gives me backgammon >:V
[18:33:28] <riyonuk> Nobody? :>
[18:34:12] <dilvie> kaneda^: not using jQuery?
[18:34:25] <kaneda^> dilvie, i wrote that one before i started learning jquery
[18:35:14] <kaneda^> i'll partially convert it now
[18:37:12] <dilvie> kaneda^: I'd be suspicious of that innerValues object
[18:37:26] <kaneda^> ok
[18:37:50] <dilvie> because you're creating the elements from scratch here, there's nothing stored in any cache except your data object
[18:38:30] <dilvie> set a watch on that innerValues object when you step into the function and verify that it has the correct data.
[18:40:59] <kristofer91> http://pastebin.com/kELEBtvU
[18:41:02] <kristofer91> ups
[18:47:19] <Myrth> hi, i'm trying $(document).bind('ajaxComplete', function(ev) { console.log(ev); }); but ev.data is always null. is that how it's suppose to be, or i'm missing something? thanks
[18:48:29] <kaneda^> dilvie, i find this whole thing very strange :/
[18:50:00] <kaneda^> dilvie, i can verify that the data it's getting back is up to date
[18:50:07] <kaneda^> the table isnt utnil i clear the browser cache for IE though
[18:50:32] <dilvie> kaneda^: Can you reproduce the problem on jsfiddle.net?
[18:50:52] <dilvie> I'm afraid I can't help much more unless I can see the behavior for myself.
[18:51:49] <Myrth> nm, i got it
[18:55:54] <kaneda^> dilvie, http://woork.blogspot.com/2007/11/how-to-solve-internet-explorer-cache.html
[18:55:59] <kaneda^> this fixed the problem -_-
[18:58:40] <dilvie> kaneda^: that's not surprising, but you told me that you verified that the data was correct in the JavaScript. That's why I asked you to use the debugger to be sure. =)
[18:58:59] <kaneda^> the data is correct according to the JS
[18:59:10] <kaneda^> IE ignores it and uses info from the cached script
[18:59:52] <dilvie> kaneda^: when I say inside the JS, I mean "do you have the correct data at the time you are writing to the DOM?" In this case, the answer was NO, because you were using the cached AJAX response.
[19:00:07] <kaneda^> ah, i see what you mean now
[19:00:12] <dilvie> yeah. ;)
[19:00:36] <kaneda^> alright, thanks for the help
[19:00:37] <kaneda^> night
[19:13:46] <kristofer91> i feel like im the only one trying to play a video on mouseover.
[19:14:01] <kristofer91> hover
[19:14:26] <imsky> mmmmmmmmmmmmmm yes
[19:15:18] <kristofer91> well it isnt exactly "me" but someone asked me to make it that way
[19:15:46] <kristofer91> and i have been going over swf library api can't find anything there, the only possible way would be with the jquery lib, and i can't seem to make it work
[19:16:14] <kristofer91> i tried every mouse event and it just didn't work
[19:16:31] <imsky> oh yeah?
[19:17:30] <kristofer91> yes -.-
[19:17:45] <kristofer91> Any suggestions :P
[19:18:37] <imsky> get an invisible div on top of your video
[19:18:45] <imsky> hover on that bad boy
[19:49:06] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: got my finite scroll working ;)
[20:04:48] <jeffreylevesque> who's still awake?
[20:05:07] <dabear_> not me atleast
[20:05:15] <Anime> neither i am
[20:05:48] <jeffreylevesque> hahah
[20:07:22] <livinded> I have a div I'm trying to turn into a jQuery UI dialog but when I call .dialog() on it, it says the method doesn't exist. I'm looking at the example and don't see anything majorly different, is there anything special I need to do?
[20:08:04] <dabear_> livinded: include jqueryui and the dialog components
[20:09:08] <livinded> dabear_: thanks, just figured it out. Forgot to include dialog in the selector
[20:22:04] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I want to do a quick animation with text, can you tell me how I can setup a loop, and then kill it later?  so I can get something like this...
[20:22:05] <abjorn> wow there's like 6 npm modules for mongodb session store middleware for connect
[20:22:06] <oojacoboo> Loading.
[20:22:08] <abjorn> da fuk
[20:22:09] <oojacoboo> Loading..
[20:22:11] <oojacoboo> Loading...
[20:22:19] <abjorn> imsky: you ever use mongo?
[20:22:29] <imsky> not really bro
[20:22:32] <abjorn> werd
[20:22:37] <abjorn> im starting to get into it
[20:22:41] <imsky> it seems to be blowing up though
[20:23:09] <abjorn> I liked it when i first heard about it, but i also heard that there was really big problems with data durability on single shard instances, but apparently they've fixed that up since then
[20:23:25] <imsky> what a bunch of pimps
[20:23:47] <abjorn> it's like couchdb, if you wanna do dynamic qwereez
[20:24:07] <imsky> hnnnggg have to install vps to use
[20:24:11] <abjorn> lol
[20:24:15] <abjorn> ?
[20:24:33] <imsky> i usually stick to whatever my benevolent host offers
[20:24:46] <imsky> i've set up enough rackspace and linode accounts to not really prize vps's
[20:24:53] <imsky> and all the benefits they offer
[20:24:58] <imsky> like mongo and node
[20:25:12] <jeffreylevesque> who's pimpin?
[20:25:13] <abjorn> whys that?
[20:25:20] <abjorn> I've liked linode so far
[20:25:35] <imsky> 2 much cognitive overhead buddy, being a sysadmin + lead dev is pain for the balls
[20:25:36] <abjorn> granted, I do long for the ease of use shared hosting has
[20:25:57] <abjorn> but, well, i dont wanna use php+mysql so
[20:26:07] <imsky> my host has ruby, python, perl, php 5.3+
[20:26:13] <imsky> 5.3 really is sweet
[20:26:23] <abjorn> so does hostgator, doesn't mean it's viable to use anything other than php :p
[20:26:28] <abjorn> man everyone has 5.3 dawg
[20:26:31] <imsky> hah
[20:26:36] <imsky> you an optimist, mah wiggla
[20:26:46] <imsky> i give it 10 years before we see mongo as a commodity option
[20:26:53] <abjorn> python on hostgator just uses fcgi, which, contrary to it's name, is slow as fuck
[20:26:58] <imsky> wsgi that shit brah
[20:27:05] <abjorn> can't on like...any shared host
[20:27:07] <imsky> i remember when i was setting up django and some other shit
[20:27:10] <imsky> lol python is so broken
[20:27:15] <abjorn> rofl right?
[20:27:20] <abjorn> it's such a bitch for web development
[20:27:24] <abjorn> that's just like...not even worth it
[20:27:30] <abjorn> django is super nice and all but
[20:27:37] <imsky> rails is even better
[20:27:40] <abjorn> if it takes a grizzled sysadmin to install it...
[20:27:47] <imsky> CUCUMBER PASSENGER MONKEYBALLS 0.7.3 BUNDLE INSTALL
[20:27:48] <coldhead> JAVA, baby
[20:27:52] <abjorn> lol
[20:27:52] <abjorn> java
[20:27:54] <abjorn> lol
[20:27:56] <imsky> mmm java
[20:28:03] <imsky> i'd program in java/c# today if hosts were affordable
[20:28:16] <abjorn> ruby on rails is even worse on hostgator, i think it's just cgi
[20:28:18] <imsky> java 7 wit de closures
[20:28:20] <coldhead> oh you need to process some strings? let me just public class static main void protected regex
[20:28:25] <abjorn> I know it doesn't use mod_ruby
[20:28:28] <imsky> (String[] args) mayne
[20:28:38] <abjorn> rofl coldhead
[20:28:51] <imsky> to be fair to the olde javo, jvm langs are pretty good these days
[20:28:53] <abjorn> java is the pinnacle of bloated syntax
[20:29:03] <abjorn> that's true
[20:29:05] <imsky> you can just skip ahead to clojure or some small javo subset
[20:29:06] <abjorn> clojure is kul
[20:29:08] <imsky> not scala though
[20:29:14] <abjorn> lol
[20:29:15] <imsky> from what i've read and used
[20:29:15] <abjorn> why not scala
[20:29:23] <imsky> "it's so easy, it's so easy, 1,000,000 types ONLY"
[20:29:29] <abjorn> rofl
[20:29:50] <coldhead> clojure makes me all puffy down there
[20:29:52] <coldhead> in a good way
[20:29:57] <imsky> i guess at some point you have to trade off between "cool thing of the week" and "need this done and reliable"
[20:30:01] <abjorn> idk, if im gonna use a language that's goal is to mix functional and object oriented...well, ill just stick with javascript
[20:30:09] <abjorn> so scala is like "ur kul and all, but no"
[20:30:13] <imsky> the cool kidse will be programming in node on haskell soon, just you watch
[20:30:18] <coldhead> mmm, js list comprehensions
[20:30:22] <imsky> javascript = scheme brah
[20:30:23] <abjorn> lol
[20:30:30] <imsky> if you know js, you know functional languages
[20:30:31] <abjorn> javascript = scheme + self brah
[20:30:39] <imsky> don't be all pedantic bro
[20:30:41] <abjorn> hey now
[20:30:57] <imsky> wish obj c worked on goddamn windows
[20:31:03] <abjorn> I consider myself experienced with javascript, but i dont claim to be an expert on functional languages. at least not ones like fucking haskell
[20:31:04] <imsky> would be interesting to use it
[20:31:10] <abjorn> I will never be able to wrap my puny little mind around haskell
[20:31:13] <imsky> yeah dude, where i'm at
[20:31:27] <imsky> haskell is like "omg if you're into computers, you're not cool if you don't do haskell"
[20:31:36] <imsky> my opinion is "if you can't make money with it, it's not cool"
[20:31:59] <imsky> if your compiler's written in c/c++, then >_>
[20:32:00] <abjorn> they start talking about monads and im just lost
[20:32:03] <imsky> lol
[20:32:15] <imsky> you should bust out ATS on em
[20:32:17] <imsky> or fortran
[20:32:18] <abjorn> my haskellfag friend has tried to explain monads to me like 10 times
[20:32:24] <abjorn> I still have no fucking idea
[20:32:26] <imsky> yeah dude, it's the same thing with scala
[20:32:37] <imsky> they just push all the complexity off into some language feature
[20:32:57] <kristofer91> imsky
[20:33:00] <kristofer91> :)
[20:33:02] <imsky> hello thear
[20:33:10] <abjorn> ohi

[20:33:14] <imsky> abjorn: for proof, look at twitter
[20:33:18] <kristofer91> this is the site i'm working on
[20:33:22] <abjorn> lol
[20:33:24] <imsky> ruby is now almost totally gone
[20:33:26] <imsky> all jvm
[20:33:30] <abjorn> oh lawd
[20:33:41] <imsky> looks shar kristofer91
[20:33:48] <abjorn> every now and then ill see my haskell friend post some complex algorithm in haskell in the size of a tweet
[20:33:48] <imsky> you wouldn't happen to be 21 this year, would you?
[20:33:48] <kristofer91> the white blank image is where i want when hovered to display my swf object, that i already have a plugin playing
[20:34:15] <abjorn> This page is in Dutch Would you like to translate it?
[20:34:22] <kristofer91> nothing to understand :P
[20:34:23] <imsky> freaky deaky dutch?
[20:34:33] <abjorn> chrome needs to learn how to translate text in images
[20:34:40] <imsky> business idea
[20:34:40] <coldhead> i've been predicting the complete and utter domination of the JVM for years now
[20:34:42] <imsky> you and me bro
[20:34:48] <imsky> coldhead: you would've been right anyway
[20:34:49] <abjorn> LETS DO IT
[20:34:55] <imsky> oracle's being a total badass
[20:35:00] <imsky> "JAVO UP IN THIS HO"
[20:35:01] <abjorn> COMPLEX IMAGE AND LANGUAG PROCESSING
[20:35:04] <imsky> omg
[20:35:08] <abjorn> lol
[20:35:10] <imsky> we are the next generation
[20:35:17] <kristofer91> i can't understand why .hover isn't working
[20:35:25] <kristofer91> i'm probably just failing big time with the code
[20:35:48] <abjorn> jsfiddle dat ho
[20:36:55] <kristofer91> im just gonna paste you the code as it is but i've tryed so many different things i couldn't care less -.-
[20:37:02] <kristofer91> http://jsfiddle.net/PxzPa/1/
[20:38:20] <abjorn> errrrr, is hhhmedia supposed to be some sort of selector?
[20:38:38] <abjorn> looks like it should be a class
[20:38:40] <abjorn> .hhhmedia
[20:38:50] <abjorn> you forgot the . if this fiddle is to be believed
[20:38:52] <imsky> abjorn: main reason why haskell is tarded
[20:38:58] <p3mulis> how come you dont use the $ shortcut?
[20:39:01] <imsky> haskell >> main = putStrLn "Goodbye, world"
[20:39:06] <kristofer91> nah it's not that
[20:39:11] <kristofer91> it's a fail for me but it's not that
[20:39:11] <imsky> jaboscript >> console.log("Goodbye, world")
[20:39:18] <kristofer91> i just changed that couple minutes ago

[20:42:26] <abjorn> ?media
[20:42:30] <bot-t> abjorn, Media - jQuery Plugin repository - We've been looking to provide a higher-quality, spam-free experience at the plugins site for some time, and a major error on our part forced us to shut down the current site before we could put the... http://plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins/media
[20:42:49] <abjorn> is .media() a plugin you're using, kristofer91?
[20:42:49] <kristofer91> wait
[20:43:00] <kristofer91> yes one sec linking it to you
[20:43:11] <kristofer91> http://jquery.malsup.com/media/
[20:43:46] <abjorn> I mean, the hover function seems fine. Have you tried a console.log or anything in the hover callback to make sure it's getting called?
[20:44:00] <abjorn> Cause I'm assuming it's a problem with the .media() function
[20:44:29] <kristofer91> could you explain a litte bit more on the console.log :)
[20:44:35] <grom358> idk if this bug with jsdom/node.js but I can't do this  $('#someEl').find('img').each(function() { $(this).replaceWith('<span>img</span>'); }
[20:45:55] <abjorn> kristofer91: never used a console.log?
[20:46:01] <abjorn> :o
[20:46:04] <kristofer91> no
[20:46:06] <abjorn> :o
[20:46:10] <kristofer91> learning jquery
[20:46:12] <abjorn> what browser you using?
[20:46:13] <kristofer91> as i can
[20:46:16] <kristofer91> firefox
[20:46:21] <abjorn> you have firebug installed?
[20:46:23] <kristofer91> oh
[20:46:33] <kristofer91> your talking about debugging with firebug
[20:46:35] <kristofer91> ?
[20:46:37] <abjorn> yeah
[20:46:43] <kristofer91> it doesnt say anything
[20:46:47] <abjorn> well, it works in other browsers too, but console.log() will output to the javascript console
[20:46:49] <abjorn> so like
[20:46:58] <abjorn> console.log("OMG HOVER OMG OMG I CANT BELIEVE IT");
[20:47:17] <imsky> did you know you can use cd
[20:47:21] <imsky> in console
[20:47:24] <imsky> awww yess
[20:47:33] <abjorn> wat
[20:47:38] <imsky> yes
[20:47:41] <abjorn> wat

[20:50:13] <abjorn> i never saw this befores
[20:50:22] <abjorn> WHATFONT, IS THAT YOU?
[20:50:48] <livinded> I have a div overlay as a loading screen on a project I'm working on that I hide after a function is called that dynamically builds the view with javascript. But the screen is being hidden before the browser finished rendering the page. Is there a way to have it hide only when it finishes without just using a timeout?
[20:51:09] <abjorn> wtf i disabled all plugins, it still happens
[20:51:38] <imsky> abjorn: check it out
[20:51:44] <imsky> here's some random page

[20:56:33] <kristofer91> what's wrong with my hhh :P ?
[20:57:08] <abjorn> enderjs, imsky?
[20:57:14] <imsky> you got it bro
[20:57:20] <imsky> another waste of time, tbh
[20:57:51] <abjorn> honestly never used ender
[20:58:03] <abjorn> i always mean to try it but then im like "EWWW ITS NEW AND I HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHINGGG"
[20:58:05] <kristofer91> it isnt printing anything
[20:58:12] <kristofer91> in the console
[20:58:13] <abjorn> well that would be a problenm
[20:58:17] <imsky> i do like https://github.com/chjj/zest abjorn
[20:58:37] <imsky> that thang is hnnngggg-licious
[20:58:46] <abjorn> tried $(".hhhmedia").length kristofer91?
[20:58:52] <abjorn> or, I guess, jQuery instead of $
[20:58:53] <abjorn> whatever
[20:58:56] <abjorn> you get the idea
[20:58:59] <kristofer91> yea
[20:59:24] <abjorn> console.log(jQuery(".hhhmedia").length);
[20:59:42] <imsky> though to be fair
[20:59:46] <imsky> if you're already in firebog
[20:59:49] <imsky> $$() mayne
[20:59:55] <abjorn> firebog
[21:00:04] <abjorn> a bog
[21:00:05] <kristofer91> firefrog -.-
[21:00:05] <abjorn> of fire
[21:00:17] <imsky> $$("#pimpslap").length
[21:00:19] <abjorn> jesuschristhowhorrifying.jpg
[21:00:25] <imsky> no need for jaekwerys
[21:00:58] <kristofer91> im really getting lost in this
[21:01:11] <imsky> well you see
[21:01:14] <imsky> i'm the pimp
[21:01:19] <imsky> and i use my selector engine
[21:01:22] <imsky> to slap a ho
[21:01:27] <kristofer91> 0
[21:01:28] <imsky> $$("#kristofer91").slap()
[21:01:31] <kristofer91> that's what it printed
[21:01:35] <kristofer91> i guess
[21:02:09] <ringotwo> you're didn't try swfobject?
[21:02:13] <Eviltwin> var s = ""; for(var i = 0; i < 256; i++) { s += "$"; window[s] = jQuery; }
[21:02:20] <kristofer91> too complicated for me before i go to sleep
[21:02:23] <kristofer91> :P
[21:02:30] <Eviltwin> $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$("div").length
[21:02:47] <abjorn> imsky: god, why do so many npm modules find it so difficult to make an API that doesn't look like it was made by a full retard?
[21:02:56] <abjorn> srs, the node-mongodb module is like
[21:02:57] <imsky> Eviltwin: what sorcery is this
[21:02:58] <abjorn> full retard
[21:03:12] <imsky> abjorn: oh man i know. open source is mostly "works for me, here's the code"
[21:03:23] <abjorn> https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native look at this bullshit
[21:03:29] <kristofer91> now i dont know wether to try $("gotosleep").wtf or something
[21:03:33] <kristofer91> this is really annoying me
[21:03:58] <abjorn> $("#kristofer91").sleep(8);
[21:03:58] <kristofer91> is 0 what that .length is supposed to print ?
[21:04:03] <abjorn> no
[21:04:04] <imsky> abjorn: this is why "bleeding edge" shit always changes every 6 months
[21:04:05] <abjorn> it's not
[21:04:09] <abjorn> that means it's not finding the element
[21:04:15] <abjorn> where is the javascript located?
[21:04:21] <imsky> the bros who actually want to use it get frustrated with reading the sauce
[21:04:24] <abjorn> if it's in the <head> make sure it's within an ondomready
[21:04:42] <abjorn> well, within $(document).ready(function () { .... });
[21:04:53] <abjorn> or $(function() { }); if you're feeling like a badass
[21:05:09] <imsky> haha abjorn
[21:05:21] <imsky> did you run "make total" yet
[21:05:30] <abjorn> ?
[21:05:31] <ringotwo> $('#kristofer91').delay(8 * 60 * 60);
[21:05:34] <imsky> https://github.com/christkv/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/Makefile
[21:05:47] <abjorn> rofl
[21:05:57] <ringotwo> oops i got that wrong
[21:06:00] <imsky> make generate_docs
[21:06:04] <imsky> make me_a_sandwich
[21:06:07] <abjorn> god, it's just a mongodb driver, whhhyyy does it need all thaaat
[21:06:38] <abjorn> meanwhile, in beautiful API land: https://github.com/Abjorn/SofaJS
[21:06:39] <ringotwo> $('#kristofer91').delay(8 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

[21:06:45] <imsky> it's javascript it's better!
[21:06:46] <kristofer91> -.-
[21:06:52] <kristofer91> im trying
[21:07:00] <ringotwo> what's the issue you're having
[21:07:02] <ringotwo> i'll help you
[21:07:12] <abjorn> well, we already figured it out, kind of
[21:07:16] <kristofer91> now i get 1
[21:07:20] <abjorn> goodie
[21:07:22] <imsky> and 1 is better
[21:07:25] <kristofer91> after i doooooomeeed that domready shitt
[21:07:25] <abjorn> now do your full .media() shit
[21:07:27] <imsky> ?js "hello dere"
[21:07:28] <bot-t> imsky: "hello dere"
[21:07:44] <imsky> god i'm so cloistered inside old-ass js
[21:07:52] <abjorn> ?js "I give " + (0.1 + 0.2) + " fucks"
[21:07:53] <bot-t> abjorn: "I give 0.30000000000000004 fucks"
[21:07:59] <imsky> oh check this out
[21:08:14] <imsky> ?js !!~"hello world".indexOf("world")
[21:08:15] <bot-t> imsky: true
[21:08:19] <abjorn> lol
[21:08:36] <imsky> pretty rad brah
[21:08:41] <abjorn> fucking !! bullshit
[21:08:49] <abjorn> I want it to die
[21:08:50] <imsky> BOOLEANS WHAT IS THIS SHIT
[21:08:59] <abjorn> EITHER USE ONE 1 OR NONE
[21:09:01] <abjorn> JESUS PPL
[21:09:06] <imsky> ?js !!!!!1
[21:09:07] <bot-t> imsky: false

[21:09:40] <imsky> wohoo
[21:09:41] <abjorn> ohgod.gif
[21:10:08] <abjorn> so, works now, kristofer91?
[21:10:19] <abjorn> should be working now that it's finding the element
[21:10:55] <abjorn> imsky: I'm so lazy. I still haven't finished all my tests for sofajs on the browser end
[21:10:59] <imsky> ?js [0,1,-1,2,3,0,1].every(function(e,i,a){return !!~(e*i)});
[21:11:00] <bot-t> imsky: true
[21:11:10] <abjorn> jesus
[21:11:15] <abjorn> why would you do such a thing
[21:11:15] <imsky> abjorn: that is lazy
[21:11:20] <imsky> HNNGGG
[21:11:22] <abjorn> rite?
[21:11:42] <abjorn> probably because other, lesser couchdb drivers have gotten popular in npm
[21:11:48] <abjorn> and im like
[21:11:50] <abjorn> "FUCK IT"
[21:12:05] <abjorn> so what if mine is better ;-;
[21:12:18] <imsky> ?js [0,1,2,3,4].reduceRight(function(a,b,c,d){return ""+a+(""+~!!+b);});
[21:12:19] <bot-t> imsky: "4-2-2-2-1"
[21:12:33] <vasa> how do i pass variables into an iframe before the iframe is even created, assuming i am in the same domain name of course.
[21:12:39] <Eviltwin> ?js function isOdd(n) { var odd = false; while(n-- > 0) odd = !odd; }; [isOdd(1), isOdd(3), isOdd(4), isOdd(8), isOdd(0)];

[21:12:44] <Eviltwin> Oops
[21:12:46] <imsky> GOOD JOB
[21:12:49] <Eviltwin> ?js function isOdd(n) { var odd = false; while(n-- > 0) odd = !odd; return off; }; [isOdd(1), isOdd(3), isOdd(4), isOdd(8), isOdd(0)];
[21:12:51] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ReferenceError: off is not defined
[21:12:53] <Eviltwin> ...
[21:12:54] <imsky> BETTER JOB

[21:12:58] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [true, true, false, false, false]
[21:13:02] <kristofer91> looks like it's working
[21:13:08] <abjorn> sweet
[21:13:15] <kristofer91> now i just need to add the function when getting the mouse leaves i guess
[21:13:20] <kristofer91> or once it's eaten by the cat
[21:13:34] <kristofer91> but it's nice to know
[21:13:36] <kristofer91> the console.log
[21:13:37] <kristofer91> :)
[21:13:52] <kristofer91> i really am not making any sense any more
[21:13:56] <kristofer91> really need to get to bed ffs
[21:14:00] <Eviltwin> ?js function isOdd(n) { if(n <= 0) return false; return !isOdd(n-1); }; [isOdd(1), isOdd(3), isOdd(4), isOdd(8), isOdd(0)];
[21:14:01] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [true, true, false, false, false]
[21:14:19] <vasa> how do i pass variables into an iframe before the iframe is even created, assuming i am in the same domain name of course.
[21:14:22] <imsky> ?js [0,1,2,3,4].reduceRight(function(a,b,c,d){return a<<b+(~a >>> b);});
[21:14:22] <bot-t> imsky: 0
[21:14:25] <imsky> YES
[21:14:27] <imsky> purity
[21:14:28] <Eviltwin> Which of those do you guys think has better performance? :P
[21:14:32] <ringotwo> vasa, you should pass them through a querystring
[21:14:34] <abjorn> console.log is elementary, my dear watson
[21:14:39] <imsky> i dunno, why don't you run it on jsperf eviltwin
[21:14:50] <kristofer91> well like i said
[21:14:51] <abjorn> ^ good time waster
[21:14:58] <kristofer91> i dont use jquery very often
[21:15:03] <vasa> what do you mean
[21:15:03] <Eviltwin> ?js while(true);
[21:15:07] <abjorn> ive wasted like...2 hours on jsperf
[21:15:08] <bot-t> Eviltwin: No output. (Process Killed)
[21:15:11] <abjorn> so much
[21:15:11] <ringotwo> <iframe href="file.html?a=1&b=2
[21:15:20] <abjorn> ^
[21:15:22] <vasa> and how do i retrive it within the frame
[21:15:33] <ringotwo> iframe
[21:15:57] <abjorn> gotta parse window.location.href in the iframe
[21:15:58] <ringotwo> umm, well, you can use javascript, or a server language like php or python
[21:16:10] <vasa> i prefer to stay in the client side please
[21:16:24] <abjorn> query strings are pretty easy to parse though
[21:16:31] <ringotwo> there's a crappy plugin called jquery.querystring.js
[21:16:41] <abjorn> or make your own cause it suprez
[21:16:41] <vasa> i just want within the jquery code to pass a single var into the iframe
[21:16:43] <ringotwo> that'll work for you
[21:16:56] <abjorn> that's the only way you're gonna pass a var into an iframe before it's loaded
[21:17:08] <vasa> ok i'll check that out thanks
[21:17:23] <imsky> ?js [1,2,3,4,5].reduceRight(function(a,b,c,d){return (~a+~~b)^d;});
[21:17:24] <bot-t> imsky: 3
[21:17:35] <imsky> right on playa
[21:17:50] <imsky> ?js [1,2,999,4,5].reduceRight(function(a,b,c,d){return (~a+~~b)^d;});
[21:17:50] <bot-t> imsky: 999
[21:17:54] <imsky> woo
[21:18:24] <ringotwo> wow
[21:18:30] <abjorn> var vars = window.location.href.split("?")[1].split("&");
[21:18:30] <abjorn> for (var i = 0; i < vars.length; i++) {
[21:18:30] <abjorn>   var thingie = vars.split("=");
[21:18:30] <abjorn>   someObj[thingie[0]] = thingie[1];
[21:18:31] <abjorn> }
[21:18:32] <abjorn> omg!
[21:18:36] <abjorn> i just parsed query string omg!
[21:18:37] <imsky> ogm :V
[21:19:33] <abjorn> o i totally meant to do vars[i].split("=");
[21:19:34] <abjorn> whatever
[21:19:42] <ringotwo> but...
[21:19:48] <abjorn> IT'S 11:19 I DON'T CARE
[21:19:57] <ringotwo> if you have a hash in the url, the last querystring param would be wrong
[21:20:04] <vasa> hey
[21:20:09] <abjorn> FINE
[21:20:19] <vasa> assuming i can pass vars to the iframe after i load it how do i do it?
[21:20:26] <abjorn> var vars = window.location.href.split("?")[1].split("#")[0].split("&");
[21:20:29] <abjorn> YOU HAPPY?
[21:20:35] <vasa> are you speaking to me
[21:20:37] <ringotwo> haha yes
[21:20:40] <abjorn> no
[21:20:48] <abjorn> i was appeasing lord ringotwo
[21:21:07] <imsky> what a doof
[21:21:10] <vasa> can i please have an example on how to send the variable and recieve it on the iframe
[21:21:12] <ringotwo> jeez
[21:21:13] <abjorn> you could try and be some ninja and use regular expressions, but then you're just being a douche
[21:21:27] <imsky> ?js /beep boop/ig
[21:21:28] <bot-t> imsky: /beep boop/gi
[21:21:34] <imsky> well played
[21:21:55] <abjorn> bot-t just schooled you

[21:22:04] <bot-t> imsky: ReferenceError: fromCharCode is not defined
[21:22:08] <imsky> ohhhhh
[21:22:13] <abjorn> HAH
[21:22:25] <imsky> :(
[21:22:41] <imsky> i tryd but its only a string method
[21:22:51] <ringotwo> vasa, you're wondering how to send variables to the iframe, or how to process them in the iframe itself?
[21:23:07] <vasa> both
[21:23:08] <imsky> ?js String.fromCharCode(34,25,12,26,78,35,19);
[21:23:09] <bot-t> imsky: "\"\fN#"
[21:23:11] <imsky> yes
[21:23:22] <abjorn> man wtf, my sofajs doesn't even show up in search.npmjs.org when you search "couch" or "couchdb", what is this bullshit, imsky?
[21:23:33] <Eviltwin> ?js [34,25,12,26,78,35,19].map(String.fromCharCode)
[21:23:34] <bot-t> Eviltwin: ["\"
[21:23:39] <imsky> abjorn: today is the first day i hear about npmjs.org
[21:23:43] <abjorn>  /cry
[21:23:44] <ringotwo> hold on
[21:24:14] <coldhead> looks like wikipedia is back kids
[21:24:18] <coldhead> resume your vandalism
[21:24:21] <imsky> it never left
[21:24:24] <imsky> archive.org mah playa
[21:24:25] <abjorn> good i can turn js back on
[21:24:31] <abjorn> on wikipedia
[21:24:34] <imsky> lol noob
[21:24:38] <imsky> stylish + user styles
[21:24:41] <abjorn> psh
[21:24:47] <abjorn> this is easier
[21:24:52] <imsky> suuure
[21:24:55] <abjorn> IT IS
[21:24:56] <ringotwo> vasa, you want to generate the url to the iframe using javascript also?
[21:25:02] <abjorn> WHY IS IT SO HOT IN MY ROOM
[21:25:07] <vasa> no no, i already have the url to it
[21:25:07] <imsky> lol tejas
[21:25:19] <abjorn> more like too-poor-to-use-the-ac-....jas
[21:25:19] <vasa> i just need a way to pass and recieve in it the variable
[21:25:23] <ringotwo> what is the variable that you want to send, can i ask?
[21:25:41] <vasa> i could use a cookie but that sounds stupid
[21:25:42] <ringotwo> is it a string?
[21:25:43] <abjorn> btw imsky i moved out n shit
[21:25:46] <abjorn> i forgot to mention that
[21:25:47] <imsky> i saw on twitters
[21:25:50] <abjorn> o
[21:25:51] <imsky> congrats
[21:25:52] <abjorn> kew
[21:25:52] <kristofer91> isn't there a way i could like unregisted that .media
[21:25:52] <vasa> its an object with arrays in it
[21:25:56] <kristofer91> when .mouseleave()
[21:26:02] <abjorn> its like im a big boy now
[21:26:03] <ringotwo> ohh
[21:26:03] <kristofer91> or within that .hover
[21:26:06] <ringotwo> how big
[21:26:10] <vasa> umm
[21:26:16] <vasa> sec
[21:26:32] <kristofer91> http://jsfiddle.net/7f64j/1/
[21:26:36] <kristofer91> so far this is what i got
[21:26:51] <ringotwo> you made it seem like you just wanted to send a nice little string or something
[21:26:57] <abjorn> whelp, all mongodb node drivers suck, so i guess ill stick with mongoose. not that mongo really needs an ODM, but whatever
[21:27:07] <vasa> [Object { ip="127.0.0.1", title="127.0.0.1 (4:59:39", start="2012-01-19T02:59:39.741Z"}, Object { ip="127.0.0.1", title="127.0.0.1 (7:26:46", start=Date}]
[21:27:15] <kristofer91> well i've been trying different things,
[21:27:16] <vasa> thats 2 objects
[21:27:20] <kristofer91> this is just where i am stoped :P
[21:27:25] <ringotwo> can it be longer than that, or usually that size?
[21:27:32] <vasa> each object that size
[21:27:40] <vasa> will be more objects, tho
[21:27:49] <vasa> should i just give up and use cookies?
[21:27:49] <ringotwo> so you can urlencode it and pass it as a querystring parameter
[21:27:57] <ringotwo> no, i don't think a cookie is any better
[21:28:11] <vasa> but you say url encode
[21:28:15] <ringotwo> unless you want to store it for future use
[21:28:15] <vasa> that sounds very bad
[21:28:19] <ringotwo> no, it's not
[21:28:21] <vasa> because this variable can be very long...
[21:28:45] <ringotwo> you just said it's always about the same size
[21:28:46] <ringotwo> no?
[21:28:58] <vasa> each object is same size, but the var itself grows in size :P
[21:29:01] <ringotwo> the line you just pasted is not that long
[21:29:04] <vasa> it adds objects
[21:29:10] <ringotwo> oh, well what's the longest it would be?
[21:29:13] <vasa> [Object { ip="127.0.0.1", title="127.0.0.1 (4:59:39", start="2012-01-19T02:59:39.741Z"}, Object { ip="127.0.0.1", title="127.0.0.1 (7:26:46", start=Date}]
[21:29:17] <vasa> this is just the start
[21:29:27] <vasa> anyway
[21:29:31] <vasa> if url encode is the only way
[21:29:38] <ringotwo> because if it's very large, a cookie won't work either
[21:29:38] <vasa> then never mind :P
[21:29:50] <vasa> how large?
[21:29:56] <vasa> i mean what a cookie can handle?
[21:29:59] <ringotwo> why do you need iframe?
[21:30:10] <vasa> for a popup
[21:30:18] <vasa> i mean not a window based one
[21:30:22] <vasa> a stylish one
[21:30:31] <ringotwo> that doesn't mean it has to be iframe

[21:40:49] <abjorn> /x/ is mostly creepypasta, telling creepy stories and shit, and that was the most hilarious fail attempt at creepypasta
[21:40:50] <abjorn> of all tiems
[21:40:58] <ringotwo> it's the guy who calls people up and says "what are you doing with my daughter?"
[21:41:01] <ringotwo> that's his thing
[21:41:06] <abjorn> its how he gets off
[21:41:07] <imsky> wouldn't you do that
[21:41:10] <imsky> if you had the time
[21:41:14] <ringotwo> i think i've done it before

[21:42:22] <abjorn> but not on my computer
[21:42:24] <abjorn> ...makes sense!
[21:42:44] <vasa> click on the iframe
[21:42:53] <ringotwo> page not loading

[21:44:30] <abjorn> wtf it didnt open
[21:44:39] <abjorn> http://ohinternet.com/Creepypasta/Bad
[21:45:56] <ringotwo> that's an iframe all right
[21:46:13] <ringotwo> so vasa, you just add the right classname, and topup generates the iframe?
[21:46:20] <ngharo> haha "a skeleton popped out!"
[21:46:28] <vasa> yeah
[21:46:42] <ringotwo> but it's not the right way to do it, though
[21:46:43] <vasa> i can also preset options
[21:46:52] <ringotwo> you could set a cookie, i'm sure
[21:46:55] <abjorn> ngharo: lol i know, these are great
[21:46:56] <ringotwo> it's just a hacky way to do it
[21:46:59] <vasa> i know, but i was not able to do it the other way
[21:47:10] <abjorn> the Creepypasta/Awesome are not ones i would suggest reading this late at night though :p
[21:47:13] <ringotwo> it was probably something very simple you missed
[21:47:14] <vasa> but i use cookies anyway
[21:47:17] <vasa> why not just to read it?
[21:47:42] <vasa> yeah i missed, i broke my head for like 3 hours on it :P
[21:47:46] <ringotwo> hey, if it works for you
[21:47:57] <ringotwo> i just think you're gonna run into troubles
[21:48:07] <vasa> yeah me too xD
[21:48:14] <ringotwo> cookies unreliable
[21:48:23] <vasa> ohh well
[21:48:26] <ringotwo> it's better to go back and figure out what you did wrong
[21:48:43] <vasa> i will, but not today, i got a headache of all this xD
[21:48:47] <ringotwo> well, whatever, who am i to say
[21:48:54] <ringotwo> yeah, me too
[21:48:57] <ringotwo> i feel like i'm at work

[21:49:26] <ringotwo> a bute
[21:49:35] <abjorn> not all creepypasta are longpasta
[21:49:36] <vasa> thanks for the help tho :P
[21:49:41] <vasa> good luck guys
[21:49:50] <vasa> see you
[21:51:13] <ringotwo> i saw a ghost once. it glowed, just like in ghostbusters
[21:52:12] <ringotwo> it was an old woman in an old house, sitting in a rocking chair next to my bed. she flew off when i woke up.
[21:53:01] <someprimetime> did you fellas black out any of your sites today?
[21:53:11] <oojacoboo> na, I like business
[21:53:34] <oojacoboo> our clients wouldn't have been too happy about that...
[21:53:34] <abjorn> imsky:
[21:53:34] <abjorn> I WAS GO TO SLEEP WHEN TIRED
[21:53:34] <abjorn> BUT WAKE UP BECAUSE AT DOOR!!!
[21:53:34] <abjorn> I GO TO DOOR!! I OPEN NOBODY WAS THERE!!!
[21:53:34] <abjorn> IT WAS FONE
[21:53:41] <imsky> lol
[21:53:48] <oojacoboo> can someone please give me a hand with this fiddle
[21:53:49] <coldhead> hahaha
[21:53:49] <oojacoboo> http://jsfiddle.net/LNS3K/
[21:53:52] <ngharo> loll
[21:53:55] <oojacoboo> I can't seem to get it to play the right tune
[21:54:11] <someprimetime> well luckily i don't have any clients on the site i censored, although i didn't really black it out
[21:54:13] <someprimetime> just changed the logo
[21:54:21] <someprimetime> linked it to the stop sopa page thing
[21:55:17] <coldhead> oojacoboo: why not just $("#phatbox-wrapper").draggable( "option", "handle", "#phatbox-header" ); ?
[21:55:36] <ringotwo> i deleted the wikipedia overlay to read the contents beneath
[21:55:38] <oojacoboo> coldhead: b/c I need it bound to an element that stays in the DOM
[21:56:22] <oojacoboo> coldhead: you can still navigate the site with the "phatbox" open
[21:56:26] <coldhead> sorry oojacoboo, way to advanced for me >: |
[21:56:29] <coldhead> too*
[21:56:43] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[21:56:50] <oojacoboo> dude… come on
[21:56:52] <imsky> google blacked out its little logo
[21:56:56] <imsky> but what if it blacked out
[21:56:57] <imsky> youtube
[21:57:19] <oojacoboo> coldhead: if you have a complaint with how I'm doing that, could you explain
[21:58:03] <coldhead> no complaints, oojacoboo, i just flat out don't understand
[21:58:04] <ringotwo> $(this) would be body
[21:58:12] <ringotwo> how can you drag the body around?
[21:58:26] <oojacoboo> ringotwo: I see
[21:58:49] <ringotwo> the body is far too heavy to drag around
[21:58:53] <oojacoboo> that obv makes sense since it's the object
[21:58:59] <ringotwo> unless it's a schoolgirl
[21:59:01] <oojacoboo> ringotwo: that's not the goal
[21:59:38] <oojacoboo> is there a variable or option setup for the element you are binding?
[21:59:51] <oojacoboo> s/option/object
[22:00:44] <ringotwo> not... sure... what you mean
[22:01:02] <oojacoboo> I'm trying to do this… http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#event-drag
[22:01:07] <oojacoboo> with options
[22:01:09] <ringotwo> so maybe you want to find the phatbox inside the body
[22:01:13] <oojacoboo> which is the "handle" option
[22:01:15] <ringotwo> ?
[22:01:19] <ringotwo> ok, lemme look
[22:01:58] <ringotwo> right, so you have a phatbox inside the body that you want to drag
[22:02:00] <oojacoboo> the problem is, I don't know how to write out the syntax for the options on the ui.draggable
[22:02:04] <oojacoboo> yes
[22:02:12] <ringotwo> oh, you don't know how to set an option
[22:02:16] <oojacoboo> correct
[22:02:17] <ringotwo> i think it's pretty easy
[22:02:28] <oojacoboo> not within that binding
[22:02:38] <ringotwo> umm... lemme look
[22:02:45] <coldhead> schoolgirl, very droll ringotwo
[22:02:57] <imsky> oojacoboo: what's the probs jacob?
[22:02:59] <ringotwo> thx
[22:03:25] <oojacoboo> imsky: I think ringotwo is on it, but just trying to set options on the ui.draggable event when binding it
[22:03:26] <ringotwo> how do you set a jquery ui option value
[22:05:14] <imsky> oojacoboo: what's so hard about it?
[22:05:23] <oojacoboo> imsky: the fact that I don't know how to set it
[22:05:50] <oojacoboo> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/LNS3K/1/
[22:05:52] <oojacoboo> something like that
[22:06:10] <oojacoboo> I just don't understand the syntax :/  and I can't find anything on it
[22:06:13] <ringotwo> this is for a dialog box: $(foo).dialog({ autoOpen: false })
[22:06:16] <imsky> lol
[22:06:24] <imsky> wtf is this junk
[22:06:25] <ringotwo> that's an option set initially
[22:06:37] <ringotwo> you can set options after you've created the widget, too
[22:06:55] <oojacoboo> ringotwo, yes, I get that, but when binding, it's not the same
[22:08:44] <ringotwo> i'm not too familiar with on(), reading about it
[22:08:57] <oojacoboo> ringotwo: same as delegate
[22:09:03] <oojacoboo> syntax wise
[22:09:12] <oojacoboo> and virtually the same thing
[22:09:13] <imsky> oojacoboo: why are you doing it this way
[22:09:31] <oojacoboo> imsky: as opposed to not delegating it?
[22:09:39] <imsky> i guess. seems overkill
[22:09:45] <abjorn> imsky: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEavARJOptg im not sure how/why i found this, but i did
[22:09:59] <oojacoboo> imsky: you can load other pages with the modal box open, so the DOM changes
[22:10:13] <imsky> abjorn: get off the internets
[22:10:32] <imsky> oojacoboo: and the modal box remains on top of the body while the body changes?
[22:10:33] <ringotwo> so the phatbox might be deleted and a new phatbox created?
[22:10:38] <oojacoboo> imsky: yes
[22:10:42] <imsky> lol
[22:10:48] <imsky> i know what you're doing
[22:10:53] <imsky> you're a crazy coot
[22:10:54] <oojacoboo> it's within a software app
[22:10:58] <imsky> yes yes
[22:11:04] <donCams> just pushing my luck, anybody here uses aloha-editor?
[22:11:31] <coldhead> i watched a screencast about it a few years ago, donCams!
[22:11:46] <imsky> oojacoboo: in this case, why re-initialize the handle?
[22:11:55] <imsky> once you set that thang up, it's all gravy
[22:11:58] <oojacoboo> imsky: well, I'd have to do that on every ajax call, no?
[22:12:14] <imsky> is the _whole_ body changed, oojacoboo?
[22:12:17] <oojacoboo> no
[22:12:19] <imsky> ok
[22:12:25] <imsky> so why bother with reinitializing
[22:12:40] <oojacoboo> well, that's why I was trying to delegate the event
[22:13:39] <imsky> wait what
[22:13:45] <imsky> that makes no sense
[22:13:49] <imsky> you're not ever losing the binding
[22:14:04] <imsky> are you removing and reinserting the modal box?
[22:14:30] <oojacoboo> I'm not, and it shouldn't… let me check something else
[22:16:53] <oojacoboo> imsky: :/ js bug or something, I restarted the browser and it's behaving properly now
[22:17:04] <imsky> woe is us
[22:17:19] <oojacoboo> I wasn't even thinking, and assumed it was a binding issue
[22:17:35] <oojacoboo> but of course, if it's stays in the DOM it's not being unbound
[22:18:04] <oojacoboo> anyway, thanks
[22:18:08] <abjorn> alright
[22:18:08] <imsky> yw bud
[22:18:10] <abjorn> criminal scum
[22:18:12] <abjorn> its time for bed
[22:18:13] <ringotwo> so on() replaces delegate() and live()?
[22:18:15] <imsky> good night abjorn
[22:18:21] <abjorn> night
[22:18:23] <imsky> you wigglin bro
[22:18:23] <oojacoboo> ringotwo: yes
[22:18:26] <ringotwo> gnite
[22:18:50] <ringotwo> live() didn't live very long
[22:20:58] <oojacoboo> imsky: so, the issue is when I close out the modal and open again, it doesn't work the second time
[22:20:59] <ringotwo> i never really knew if it was live like "we lived" or "saturday night live"
[22:21:16] <oojacoboo> it'
[22:21:17] <oojacoboo> s
[22:21:33] <imsky> oojacoboo: rebind draggable when you open it again. i suppose you can delegate it, but just do it the ghetto way
[22:21:35] <oojacoboo> ugh… it's not due to the page change as I was thinking (wrongly)
[22:21:55] <oojacoboo> imsky: it's rebound every time
[22:22:06] <imsky> doesn't seem like it
[22:22:10] <oojacoboo> well, the binding is part of the initialization
[22:22:12] <imsky> you got an event mismatch somewhere
[22:22:20] <imsky> the modal isn't visible in dom or some such
[22:22:35] <oojacoboo> mmm, maybe I need to unbind on close
[22:22:40] <imsky> err no
[22:23:05] <imsky> you could set something up that's a little clunky but can work
[22:23:10] <imsky> trigger an event on modal open
[22:23:16] <imsky> and bind the draggable bindings to the event
[22:23:17] <oojacoboo> imsky: yea, I do
[22:23:40] <imsky> well why is it broken :\
[22:23:46] <imsky> WHY I SAY
[22:23:58] <oojacoboo> heh, I don't know, the rest of the code in the function fires
[22:24:03] <ringotwo> i would listen to imsky
[22:24:03] <oojacoboo> the same part the binding is in
[22:24:26] <oojacoboo> ringotwo: I am ;)
[22:25:12] <ringotwo> they're dissecting a huge dead whale on PBS
[22:25:19] <imsky> oh lawd
[22:25:55] <mindis|wurk> well this is interesting. i have an iframe that refuses to center itself in its parent object
[22:26:08] <oojacoboo> imsky: 		$("#phatbox-wrapper").draggable( { handle: '#phatbox-header' });
[22:26:15] <imsky> yep
[22:26:19] <oojacoboo> I'm using that to setup within the initialization function
[22:26:22] <imsky> lookin sharp
[22:26:26] <oojacoboo> the same function that does everything else
[22:26:57] <oojacoboo> yea, but after it's "closed", it doesn't have that event anymore, the elements do not leave the DOM
[22:27:12] <imsky> you know that makes no sense right
[22:27:25] <oojacoboo> imsky: yes, but I know what I'm experiencing :/
[22:27:37] <imsky> check all your modal close code
[22:27:38] <ringotwo> does iframe have margin: auto?
[22:27:39] <imsky> see what it does
[22:27:42] <oojacoboo> the only thing I see that could be an issue is one of the children is .empty()
[22:27:46] <imsky> ringotwo: no buddy
[22:27:50] <oojacoboo> is it possible the browser repaints for that?
[22:27:58] <imsky> oojacoboo: you're thinking wayy too deep
[22:28:12] <imsky> unless the children contain the handle, it's a dead end
[22:28:25] <oojacoboo> no, it's further down the DOM for the empty
[22:28:36] <fourcolors> is there a way to cut some text from a div and paste it into a javascript function with jQuery
[22:28:41] <fourcolors> im having a hard time doing this
[22:28:55] <oojacoboo> well, it's a sibling of the handle
[22:28:57] <imsky> lolwut
[22:29:17] <ringotwo> fourcolors: maybe
[22:29:18] <imsky> oojacoboo: why are you doing so much on close
[22:29:25] <ringotwo> do you have some code to look at
[22:29:27] <imsky> just .hide the thing and be done with it
[22:29:32] <oojacoboo> imsky: I'm just clearing out the contents of the modal
[22:29:37] <oojacoboo> in one container
[22:29:42] <imsky> hmmm
[22:29:43] <oojacoboo> and setting display: none;
[22:29:55] <imsky> ok i'll trust you that it's got nothing to do with the handles
[22:29:56] <fourcolors> ringotwo: sure one second
[22:30:42] <oojacoboo> the div maintains the ui-draggable class as well :/
[22:32:26] <imsky> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/LNS3K/2/
[22:32:34] <imsky> may i suggest doing some event debugging sire
[22:32:35] <fourcolors> ringotwo: http://jsfiddle.net/V6pvT/
[22:32:44] <fourcolors> ringotwo: I'm working with codemirror
[22:33:10] <fourcolors> ringotwo: what I'm trying to do is create a div with code in it, then extract that code and put it into my javascript function
[22:33:38] <oojacoboo> imsky: yea… just a lot of variables in this equation :/
[22:34:25] <imsky> oojacoboo: maybe you should revisit it in the morning
[22:34:27] <Whirl3d> What is the easiest way to take a list of options (inside a select item) and arrange them alphabetically when adding a new option?
[22:34:35] <oojacoboo> imsky: maybe
[22:37:34] <bobbobbins> hey, im using this line of code, and it doesn't appear to work, am i doing something wrong? $("input:visible, select:visible, textarea:visible").removeAttr("disabled");
[22:38:06] <bobbobbins> i also tried attr("disabled", "")
[22:38:28] <imsky> $("input,select,textarea").find(":visible").prop("disabled",false)
[22:38:32] <imsky> should be a start
[22:38:37] <red_square> no
[22:38:44] <imsky> nein
[22:38:44] <bobbobbins> the opposite works though $("input:hidden, select:hidden, textarea:hidden").attr("disabled", "disabled");
[22:38:58] <bobbobbins> no? don't do that?
[22:39:01] <red_square> selector looks ok bobbobbins
[22:39:07] <red_square> no to imsky
[22:39:14] <imsky> selector is slow
[22:39:24] <Cork> ?.removeAttr @ bobbobbins
[22:39:25] <bot-t> bobbobbins, .removeAttr(attributeName): Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[22:39:53] <red_square> your wouldnt work imsky you were finding visible children
[22:39:59] <imsky> my bad
[22:40:03] <imsky> .filter instead of .find
[22:40:11] <Cork> bobbobbins: opps missed that what you posted first, that should work
[22:40:12] <red_square> thats slower
[22:40:24] <imsky> oh yeah?
[22:40:27] <bobbobbins> yeah...it should...but its not for some reason
[22:40:45] <bobbobbins> lemmie try to jsfiddle it up real quick
[22:40:58] <Cork> bobbobbins: is $("input:visible, select:visible, textarea:visible").length returning the expected number of elements?
[22:41:12] <bobbobbins> Cork: lemmie check
[22:41:20] <Cork> imsky: you want to use :psudo-class as few times as posible
[22:41:37] <Cork> those are functions that are run one time for each matched element
[22:42:01] <bobbobbins> Cork: yeah, its returning the right number
[22:42:37] <Cork> bobbobbins: what version of jquery?
[22:43:14] <bobbobbins> 1.7
[22:44:13] <imsky> "To achieve the best performance when using :hidden to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":hidden")."
[22:44:18] <imsky> lololol
[22:44:27] <imsky> http://api.jquery.com/hidden-selector/
[22:44:34] <bobbobbins> im doing a fade in right before it, maybe i need to put it in the call back
[22:44:46] <Cork> bobbobbins: http://jsfiddle.net/DzqqZ/
[22:44:56] <Cork> bobbobbins: you do
[22:45:06] <imsky> so much for "slower" eh ;)
[22:45:28] <Cork> bobbobbins: fades are async, so your removeAttr runs before the first frame of the animation
[22:45:41] <Cork> and way before its visible
[22:46:13] <red_square> imsky well no good being fast and wrong
[22:46:19] <bobbobbins> Cork: yeah, that did it, thanks!
[22:46:34] <imsky> red_square: buddy, saying "no" isn't much of an improvement
[22:47:06] <imsky> it wasn't slower, i knew it wasn't, and docs corroborate it
[22:47:12] <red_square> I was telling him/you it wouldnt work
[22:47:18] <red_square> you had .find
[22:47:24] <imsky> yeah and i caught my error as soon as i wrote it
[22:47:55] <red_square> so no was right
[22:48:03] * imsky shrugs
[22:48:26] <red_square> ok imsky, tell us how much quiker it is
[22:48:37] <imsky> jsperf that bad boy and let me know
[22:51:14] <imsky> nvm did it myself
[22:51:27] <red_square> congrats
[22:51:36] <imsky> lol you're a barrel of fun
[22:51:48] <red_square> ty
[22:51:53] <imsky> http://jsperf.com/hidden-vs-filter
[22:51:55] <imsky> twice as fast
[22:53:20] <imsky> [01:48] red_square: ok imsky, tell us how much quiker it is
[22:53:22] <imsky> ^ told
[22:54:57] <red_square> well I was using your .find
[22:55:03] <red_square> http://jsperf.com/hidden-vs-filter/2
[22:55:05] <red_square> :)
[22:55:52] <imsky> wow good job, you went to the trouble of making a test case for something i already corrected.
[22:55:56] <imsky> to prove what point exactly?
[22:56:10] <imsky> "look, look, you were originally wrong!"
[22:56:11] <red_square> to ba as much as a knob as you
[22:56:15] <imsky> nah man
[22:56:21] <imsky> you're the biggest knob in this chan
[22:56:32] <red_square> haha cretin
[22:56:55] <imsky> good one
[23:01:34] <terryleigh> $('#mailer').children('.message').html() ... does not work?
[23:01:58] <terryleigh> but it does if I change mailer to a class?
[23:02:37] <red_square> what is $('#mailer').children('.message').length terryleigh
[23:05:16] <oojacoboo> imsky: 		var phatboxWrapperEl = $("#phatbox-wrapper").undelegate(); //clear any evt handlers too
[23:05:17] <terryleigh> red_square: 0
[23:05:19] <oojacoboo> lol
[23:05:28] <imsky> oojacoboo: i think .off does the same
[23:05:42] <oojacoboo> yea… I found that at the top of the initialization function...
[23:05:48] <imsky> oh
[23:06:00] <imsky> well that's useful to know
[23:06:33] <red_square> terryleigh, thats your issue then
[23:06:40] <oojacoboo> imsky: and fixes the issue ;)
[23:06:49] <imsky> good job buddy
[23:06:53] <oojacoboo> although, it's kinda funny, but I initialize after that too
[23:07:17] <oojacoboo> so, apparently, the binding and unbinding and binding again doesn't happen
[23:09:39] <terryleigh> red_square: I don't understand why it's not selecting it though?
[23:10:50] <red_square> you have no descendants of the mailer element that have a message class terryleigh
[23:11:13] <red_square> either that or your markup is badly formed maybe? pastebin your html
[23:12:19] <terryleigh> but I do... $('#mailer .message').html()  works?
[23:12:44] <terryleigh> just not: $('#mailer').children('.message').html() very confusing..
[23:14:09] <red_square> well thats looking for children
[23:14:27] <red_square> the euiv is $('#mailer>.message')
[23:14:41] <red_square> use .find not .children
[23:18:26] <terryleigh> red_square: Thanks, get it!
[23:29:12] <talin_> hello. i am still struggling with getting a minimal example of tablesorter to work
[23:29:15] <talin_> http://jsfiddle.net/TUxtW/
[23:29:28] <talin_> this is very much like the example at the tablesorter webpage
[23:43:18] <poppiez> hi guys, is there a faster way of doing this? http://pastie.org/private/mpyhhwazk8sfgtxj73ja
[23:46:04] <poppiez> would this be faster? http://pastie.org/private/3w3d4uqlby8cu2tkafatwg
