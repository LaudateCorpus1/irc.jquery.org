[00:00:50] <coldhead> oh sad
[00:01:16] <xp_prg> coldhead I can't understand how to make a jsonp request in jquery 1.2.6, do you know?
[00:06:04] <coldhead> xp_prg: i would try getJSON() and ajax() and if neither of those worked i'd guess 1.2.6 doesn't support jsonp
[00:06:16] <coldhead> then i'd either get a newer jquery or give up
[00:06:36] <coldhead> or see how the current jQuery does it and try to copy paste the code for myself
[00:11:12] <systemfault> 1.2.6!
[00:12:08] <coldhead> so many memories
[00:12:16] <coldhead> i remember when that came out :(
[00:12:25] <coldhead> those were good times
[00:12:32] <systemfault> Yeah.. just after world war 2
[00:13:04] <coldhead> hahahah
[00:36:35] <Gabriel_> if I have certain elements of a form example select boxes with data pulled using ajax and I submit the form and process it using .ajaxForm which process the form without reloading the page, would those dynamic form elements be updated or they would remain as they were?
[00:43:43] <rgr> I have an element "el" thats created from a selector of the form "("#xyz"). Its been "edited" locally on the client and I call back to the server to return the "new html for that element". I need to remove $("#xyz") and replace it with the new element. I know how to create n element from html but the problem as I see it is that the new element has the same ID as the one to be replaced causing a DOM issue. Now can I removeAttr("id"
[00:43:43] <rgr> the original element and the replace it? Or will that then mean the selector I am using to access it then invald?
[00:45:05] <martisj> mornign
[00:53:29] <xp_prg> I did jsonp, thanks all!
[00:56:51] <coldhead> good work, xp_prg
[00:56:54] <coldhead> take five
[00:58:49] * xp_prg hugs upon coldhead, whispers in his ear in a soft voice "thank you"
[01:39:24] <saedelaere> if I want to use a jquery selector on a class in the document ready function. $(".someClass").click(...). should this also work when I add this class later to my html document. meaning should the event trigger then?
[01:40:14] <astropirate> saedelaere, no, for that use .on('click' ...)
[01:50:25] <ak> is there some easy way to build a sheduler in js? like you can set that only one task can run at a time, and between every task should be Xms timeout... and the tasks just arrive in random time range...
[01:51:57] <saedelaere> astropirate: like this? http://ideone.com/UjY90
[01:52:07] <saedelaere> this is in the document ready function
[01:56:12] <saedelaere> the class itself is attached to an <a> element. <a class='detailProfilLink' href='#'>Profil</a>
[01:56:41] <saedelaere> but whatever I tried I can't catch the click event on this links

[02:12:29] <cebor> hi is there something in jquery that replaces the setInterval function to loop something, like a rotating slide show
[02:12:56] <coldhead> no cebor, you should just use recursion
[02:13:24] <w00tner> is anyone alive ?
[02:13:24] <cebor> ah ok
[02:13:25] <cebor> thx
[02:13:27] <coldhead> and setTimeout

[02:16:13] <w00tner> i have this javascript: http://fiddle.jshell.net/kAHmt/   and it requests a json file .... if i set it to "restaurantes" it works fine, but if i change the category from the "giro" value it just doesnt work

[02:41:17] <coldhead> something like that
[02:48:32] <saedelaere> coldhead: thank you very much :)
[02:57:45] <pyxorg> Hi, how can I simplify this : $('input[id^="foo_"], select[id^="foo_"], textarea[id^="foo_"]')
[02:58:00] <pyxorg> Kind of the opposite of .detach()
[02:58:40] <pyxorg> I tried $('input, select, textarea').find('[id^="foo_"]') but fruitlessly
[02:59:10] <coldhead> pyxorg: filter() instead of find() should work
[02:59:27] <coldhead> people will tell you it's not the most efficient way to do it but it sure is readable
[02:59:50] <pyxorg> Ok :) Thanks
[03:00:06] <Baheer> Hello All,
[03:00:34] <Spikes> pyxorg, can't you just set same class to all the elements you want to work with. Using this way to find elements via part of id seems too complex
[03:00:45] <Baheer> I have a link <a href="dropdb.php?db=dbname">Drop Database</a>
[03:01:12] <Baheer> I wanna send db value to php file and get the response back
[03:01:21] <Baheer> I want to do this by jQuery,
[03:01:32] <Baheer> does any body can help me please?
[03:01:51] <pyxorg> Spikes, yep I could, but it would be a bit redundant I think
[03:01:51] <Spikes> check http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[03:02:31] <Spikes> pyxorg, why? That's what classes are for - to mark multiple elements as similar
[03:03:58] <sjeijk> are there better ways to get some text out of a <p> with html() ?
[03:04:16] <Spikes> $('p').text();
[03:05:16] <pyxorg> Spikes, in all cases I'll need the id="formname_*", and I'm doing an API. So the less the end-user would have to write, the more the API would be useful
[03:05:36] <sjeijk> thanks
[03:06:06] <Spikes> pyxorg, hmm, ok, whatever works for you
[03:07:08] <Baheer> I checked but I don't know how to get the value of <a> in jQuery
[03:07:19] <banttu> submitting via $.post method works fine for chrome and some versions of f.f. In I.E and other older versions of F.F. display the query string on the address bar
[03:07:33] <banttu> what could I be missing?
[03:07:54] <Spikes> Baheer, first, better use id or class for  the link <a id="link" href="dropdb.php?db=dbname">Drop Database</a>
[03:08:26] <Spikes> Baheer, then write something like $('#link').on('click', funcion() { // ajax call goes here });
[03:09:04] <Spikes> Baheer, i'd say use google for that. Tons of guides on that matter
[03:14:17] <Baheer> I can do the rest, just help me to get the value of a link in jQuery,
[03:14:29] <Spikes> $(this).attr('href');
[03:14:34] <Baheer> I tried with $('selector').val();
[03:14:40] <Baheer> but it didn't work
[03:15:13] <Spikes> you can use val() only on elements like select, input, textarea
[03:15:40] <Spikes> What do you mean by "value of a link"
[03:15:42] <Spikes> ?
[03:16:07] <sjeijk> json is pretty cool as I get to understand it better :)
[03:16:24] <Spikes> Indeed it is
[03:16:54] <Baheer> Spikes, with $(this).attr('href'); I can get the href attribute value, but I can extract to get the db value?
[03:17:28] <Spikes> Uh, where in a link should be a db value?
[03:17:35] <Baheer> var link=dropdb.php?db=dbname;
[03:17:42] <Baheer> but how can I get the db value?
[03:17:48] <Baheer> I am almost done,
[03:17:50] <Spikes> dbname?
[03:19:14] <Spikes> You can store some kind of db value in data attribute of a link, like <a href="blahblah" data-value="here goes the value">Link</a>
[03:19:33] <ravenzz> he want to parse the url
[03:19:44] <ravenzz> and get the db's value
[03:21:04] <ravenzz> Baheer you can use a regular expression or split the url
[03:21:07] <Spikes> Why would he do that? He already got a woring link, so he just should use ajax GET request
[03:21:24] <Spikes> working*
[03:21:56] <ravenzz> I don't even know what is his issue, but I read this <Baheer> Spikes, with $(this).attr('href'); I can get the href attribute value, but I can extract to get the db value?
[03:22:08] <ravenzz> and the the example url
[03:22:35] <Spikes> ravenzz, ok, i guess without more details we can only guess what does he mean
[03:26:13] <w00nzs> i would like to say thank you to the creator of this channel, without it i could not never finish my mobile app (let's dance!).
[03:28:59] <sjeijk> whats wrong about this json http://jsfiddle.net/Yx4Dc/ ?
[03:29:23] <sjeijk> says SyntaxError: Expected token ']' but don't see whats wrong
[03:30:59] <ravenzz> sjeijk jsonlint.com
[03:31:42] <ravenzz> first of all keys must be quoted
[03:32:05] <ravenzz> and the values as well of course
[03:33:04] <sjeijk> i have 1 key the rest is arrays right
[03:33:22] <Spikes> sjeijk, setups: { instead of setups: [
[03:33:33] <Spikes> same with setup01 : {
[03:33:50] <Spikes> and replace "]" with } realted to those object
[03:35:54] <sjeijk> great! tx
[03:52:48] <tolborg> whats the difference between 'var.hide()' and '$(var).hide()', if the var is a dom element?
[03:54:04] <Spikes> Won't work?
[03:54:12] <astropirate> tolborg, the first one is imaginary
[03:55:56] <Spikes> tolborg, basically, hide() is a function in jQuery framework so when applied to jquery object it hides it, when you try using it with DOM object it will throw an error.
[03:56:40] <Spikes> tolborg, unless, previously you had assigned jquery object to that var
[03:56:53] <tolborg> spikes.. perhaps thats the case
[03:56:58] <tolborg> ill make a fiddle.. just a sex
[03:57:05] <Spikes> like var el = $('#foo'); then you can use el.hide();
[03:57:51] <Spikes> This ways allows for better performance in loops if assignment was done out of loop
[03:57:57] <Spikes> way*
[04:01:10] <sjeijk> if I want to look into an object for a class, then should I use find(), closest() or is there a better way?
[04:02:16] <sjeijk> or children maybe
[04:03:33] <Spikes> children searches for immediate child objects whether find searches as deep as it can for an element
[04:04:48] <sjeijk> Spikes you are really helpful tx..
[04:05:21] <Spikes> np
[04:05:54] <tolborg> Spikes: http://jsfiddle.net/rKTLQ/
[04:06:11] <tolborg> I think that illustrates the difference
[04:06:26] <tolborg> which method is right?
[04:07:02] <Spikes> I'd use somediv.click(function() {
[04:07:28] <tolborg> and perhaps mark it with $ as good practice?
[04:07:47] <tolborg> $somediv.click
[04:07:58] <Spikes> Yeah, i think there's something about that in docs
[04:08:16] <Spikes> Allows you to keep track of what is jq object and what's not
[04:08:19] <tolborg> last night I got all confused about the two different methods.. because they yield the same result
[04:08:52] <tolborg> Spikes: thanks :)
[04:18:46] <NexHD> hi
[04:18:53] <NexHD> i have a question
[04:19:10] <coldhead> we all have questions, buddy
[04:19:23] <coldhead> why are we here. what happens when we die.
[04:19:25] <NexHD> is good this code " if(!(reg.exec($('#mail2').val())) && ($('#mail').val())==($('#mail2').val()))"
[04:19:26] <NexHD> ?
[04:19:59] <coldhead> is not easy to read this code
[04:20:23] <coldhead> what is reg
[04:20:32] <NexHD> regular expresion
[04:20:40] <coldhead> but WHICH regular expression
[04:20:52] <NexHD>  var reg =/[a-z0-9_]+@[a-z0-9_-]+.[a-z]{2,12}$/;
[04:21:15] <coldhead> oh you are validating email addresses
[04:21:19] <coldhead> that is so coll!
[04:21:21] <coldhead> cool*
[04:21:26] <NexHD> yes
[04:21:46] <Spikes> NexHD, use html type="email" for automatic email validation
[04:21:50] <NexHD> but when i have something in mail1 field the mail2 field has no error
[04:22:01] <NexHD> that is html5?
[04:22:04] <Spikes> Yeah
[04:22:54] <NexHD> thanks
[04:24:03] <sahbeewah> that is terrible
[04:24:25] <sahbeewah> don't rely on the html5 attribute to validate
[04:24:54] <coldhead> why not, that's what it's there for baby
[04:25:11] <sahbeewah> because it won't work on older browsers
[04:25:16] <Spikes> Well, sure you should do additional validation server side, but if you expect your target audience to use modern browser i don't see why not
[04:25:21] <sahbeewah> and most people who would mistype their email, would be using older browsers
[04:25:41] <sahbeewah> client side regex validation is needed
[04:25:55] <coldhead> you can make it work in older browsers with a shim
[04:26:01] <NexHD> but someone can tel me why is not work good my code?
[04:26:02] <coldhead> writing it yourself is icky
[04:26:48] <coldhead> NexHD: your code is very hard to read or understand. try rewriting it and use variables and new lines and things
[04:26:53] <coldhead> maybe it will work better
[04:27:02] <NexHD> ok
[04:28:30] <NexHD> http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/jNJC5/
[04:28:37] <NexHD> can you read there?
[04:29:16] <coldhead> this is much nicer, NexHD
[04:29:33] <coldhead> now i can tell that the problem is almost definitely on line 3
[04:29:49] <coldhead> because that is the most complicated piece of code i have seen in days
[04:30:02] <coldhead> it needs comments and new lines and things!
[04:30:18] <NexHD> i want to combine two condition
[04:30:33] <coldhead> let me try
[04:30:37] <NexHD> ok
[04:30:50] <Spikes> Maybe use less brackets: " if( ! reg.exec($('#mail2').val()) && ($('#mail').val() == $('#mail2').val() )"
[04:33:39] <coldhead> i would write it like this http://jsfiddle.net/jNJC5/1/ maybe
[04:33:44] <NexHD> ok
[04:33:47] <NexHD> thanks
[04:33:58] <coldhead> that might not work either but it would be easier to find out why
[04:34:35] <coldhead> it should be var m1 = $('#mail1').val(), m2 = $('#mail2').val();
[04:34:52] <NexHD> thanks for help
[04:54:20] <sjeijk> Hi all I'm trying to generate a PDF using jq and php.. When I navigate to the script http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/makepdf.html then the pdf is generated like it should, but when I navigate to that script using js window.location… I get messy chars… you see it if you click on the pdf button here http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/wizard.html
[04:54:39] <sjeijk> I think it has something to do with the header, any help is welcome
[04:55:48] <dylang> this should work, right? $.ajax(...).then(...).then(...).then(...) <- for some reason only the first then is getting any arguments passed in jquery 1.8.1. worked in jquery 1.7.x
[05:00:17] <dylang> ^ looks like in 1.8 using done instead of then works
[05:04:35] <shoky> dylang: it works if in the .then callback you return data;
[05:05:24] <shoky> (like in a .pipe(..) )
[05:06:36] <shoky> (in 1.8 .then and .pipe are identical i believe)
[05:08:28] <sjeijk> how to send Post data to a .php and also visit that page?
[05:12:13] <dylang> shoky: makes sense, thanks!
[05:12:43] <dylang> http://api.jquery.com/position/ "Note: jQuery does not support getting the position coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element."  why is body ignored?
[05:18:42] <sjeijk> guys is there a way to Send data to a page and then open it using window.open or do any of you guys know how I can set a window to act as a pdf?
[05:19:19] <astropirate> sjeijk, yes. send data to the page and then open it
[05:19:47] <astropirate> sjeijk, how do you want to "send data"?
[05:20:02] <astropirate> ajas, query string
[05:20:06] <astropirate> ajax*
[05:20:16] <sjeijk> I want to send it as a Post
[05:20:19] <gnarf> dylang: because its a lot more code to use do anything other than what we do :)
[05:20:41] <sjeijk> I'm trying in ajax but then when I open the page then my pdf is scrambled
[05:21:31] <astropirate> sjeijk, ok. one way to do it would be to create a form
[05:21:44] <astropirate> and then put all of your data into it and then submit the form
[05:21:46] <sjeijk> im looking for something like window.open('makepdf.html', post=jsonarray);
[05:22:28] <astropirate> sjeijk, nope
[05:22:49] <astropirate> make the form with jqueyr.   hide it. then append it to the document
[05:22:56] <astropirate> then submit it with jquery
[05:23:06] <astropirate> window.open is for GET not POST
[05:23:18] <sjeijk> hmm
[05:23:39] <sjeijk> its about security i guess that Post is not supported then
[05:24:43] <sjeijk> point is, I could do it with ajax, but then the page it returns is a mess
[05:25:05] <sjeijk> somehow if I open.window I need to say it's a pdf
[05:25:28] <astropirate> sjeijk, y u no listen? :(
[05:25:28] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[05:25:38] <astropirate> when you submit the form, your page will be redirected
[05:26:17] <astropirate> and define "mess" please
[05:26:49] <shoky> mess:     success: function(data){  var win = window.open(); win.document.write(data); }
[05:27:06] <sjeijk> i did that
[05:27:14] <shoky> indeed
[05:27:28] <astropirate> sjeijk, did you try what i said?
[05:27:36] <sjeijk> ok here is the pdf it should be http://www.thebandwidthmatrix.com/makepdf.html
[05:28:28] <sjeijk> yes
[05:28:41] <astropirate> it did not work? :O
[05:29:14] <astropirate> sjeijk, also, thats not a browser problem. as it says something is going wrong with your serverside
[05:30:13] <sjeijk> here is the JQ http://jsfiddle.net/KtYYD/
[05:30:26] <sjeijk> that server is terrible tbh, try again
[05:31:05] <sjeijk> and I implemented that on the pdf button on this page http://thebandwidthmatrix.com/wizard.html
[05:33:35] <sjeijk> should I encode that data somehow?
[05:33:40] <sjeijk> or decode
[05:33:53] <shoky> sjeijk: an easy way to solve the problem is to ajax your POST data , have your server prepare the pdf on disk and make a new url for it, and return that url.  then in the success handler  you can load that url in a hidden iframe
[05:34:00] <sahbeewah> sjeijk: you should, fix your web server
[05:34:20] <shoky> but that's an easy way, not neccessarily a good one
[05:34:39] <sahbeewah> sjeijk: it's not playing nice with the http:// prefix
[05:35:05] <sjeijk> tx sahbeewah but i can't access that server
[05:35:08] <shoky> oh sorry, not a hidden iframe since you want it displayed, not downloaded
[05:35:20] <shoky> so, load the new url wherever you want. a new window or whatever
[05:35:29] <sjeijk> hm ok
[05:35:37] <sjeijk> ill try that shoky
[05:36:34] <astropirate> i dont' see why it needs to hit the dis anyway :S
[05:36:49] <sjeijk> dis?
[05:47:37] <astropirate> disk*
[05:47:47] <wingy> is there a way to make animation with previous/play/next using jquery animate()?

[06:35:20] <NodeX> you're database is gonna get r00ted
[06:35:26] <w00tner> pwned ?
[06:35:37] <shoky> wingy: it definitely doesn't help you move back to previous states..
[06:35:46] <w00tner> what will be the best practice? this is for a native app using phonegap
[06:35:55] <wingy> shoky: yeah .. googling about possible solutions
[06:36:01] <wingy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2132090/jquery-reversing-animation-on-second-click
[06:37:01] <shoky> anyway what i do in the fiddle should work for reversing most simple animations
[06:37:33] <wingy> yeah i have a look at it
[06:37:34] <wingy> thx
[07:05:46] <sjeijk> is there a way to check if my json is valid?
[07:07:19] <sjeijk> nvm
[07:11:20] <aibo> hi
[07:13:11] <aibo> is there a way to set the caret-position "between" two tags? doesn't need to be visible. example <a href="example.com">example</a>[CARETPOSITION]<p>foo bar</p>
[07:15:15] <ThrushAAX> huh? isn't the caret only in an editable text region?
[07:16:27] <aibo> ThrushAAX: i use contenteditable and need to execute execcommand(inserthtml) at this position
[07:17:31] <ThrushAAX> ah, I see, hmm
[07:18:48] <aibo> it's easy to solve with jquery, but i have to use execcommands to manipulate content
[07:19:12] <aibo> so i need to set the caret at the exact position :D
[07:25:25] <j_ayen_green> newb question. when an event definition is like .focusout(function()), if I do it just that way it works, but if I have function(a){} then x.focusout(a()) it doesn't.
[07:27:46] <sunbeam> hey, with datepicker, beforeShow I want to set the mindate and max date
[07:27:50] <sunbeam> is this possible?
[07:37:54] <Zauberfisch> greetings
[07:38:24] <Zauberfisch> I have: ul>li[date-time=timestamp]*100
[07:39:01] <Zauberfisch> now I have a new entry for this list, with a new timestamp, I want to insert it at the place where it belongs (the list is sorted by the timestamp)
[07:39:18] <Zauberfisch> so I have a method $('ul').addEntryAt(time)
[07:39:46] <Zauberfisch> well, for implementing that addEntryAt method, I need to find the spot where I should insert the new entrey
[07:40:09] <Zauberfisch> is there a way to find the closest match?
[07:41:16] <Zauberfisch> say the list is: http://paste2.org/p/2180886
[07:41:25] <Zauberfisch> and I want to insert 1346544430
[07:41:27] <|pez|> Ok, I have a menu that toggles, but it also toggles when it clicks the links in some of the depths... is there a way to tell jQuery not to do the toggle when it's actually clicking an a item?
[07:41:38] <Zauberfisch> so, 1346544430 would be in the middle
[07:42:09] <Zauberfisch> is there a better way then doing $('ul li').each() to find the correct place?
[07:43:39] <Zauberfisch> |pez|  I take it you are binding click to toggle? I think you might be binding that click on the menu button, and accidently on all items in the menu as well, try to add an extra class to the menu button or so and bind the click to that
[07:44:28] <syntax> can someone explain me the crazy fadeIn fadeOut problem top right on hover the Link "Language" http://lab.manstein-web.de/klostersclassics !?!
[07:44:54] <|pez|> Zauberfisch: I'm binding it to a silly <span> the code generates, so it won't make it toggle when I click the entire thing. But it does also toggle on the <a> inside the <span>.
[07:45:30] <Zauberfisch> oh, so you have bould click on the span, and all the <a>s are in that span?
[07:46:50] <tash> can someone explain with the colon means in this context?  $( ".table :checkbox[checked!=checked]" ).on "click", function(e) { } );
[07:47:57] <|pez|> Zauberfisch: Yes, I can link the site to you on PM, so you can see the structure for yourself?
[07:51:11] <Zauberfisch> |pez|  I think the way javascript events work, is that it first fires click on that <a>, and then loops all the parents and fires click on each of them
[07:51:20] <Zauberfisch> thats why your span is clicked as well
[07:51:44] <Zauberfisch> if your <a> click event handler returns event.preventDefault() or true
[07:52:09] <Zauberfisch> if your <a> click event handler returnes false, javascript should not perform that way, that means it should not trigger click on the span
[07:52:20] <|pez|> Zauberfisch: I'm pretty sure I'm not really understanding.
[07:52:26] <|pez|> I want it to trigger on the span, but not on the a itself.
[07:53:03] <|pez|> scratch "itself". Doesn't belong there. XD
[07:53:21] <Zauberfisch> yes
[07:53:48] <Zauberfisch> and the only way to tell it to not trigger on <a> is to make a event handler on <a> return false
[07:54:02] <|pez|> ohok.
[07:54:06] <Zauberfisch> at least thats the only way I know
[07:55:57] <|pez|> so a unbind would work, you think?  Gonna guess binding i inherited, and the <a therefore is kinda binded.
[07:56:30] <Zauberfisch> no, unbind will not work I think
[07:56:46] <Zauberfisch> because <a> is not bound, <a> just trigers the parent click event
[07:56:59] <Zauberfisch> so you need to bind a new click on <a> that returns false
[07:57:02] <|pez|> right.
[07:57:19] <Zauberfisch> but then your link doesn't work, because the event returns false
[07:57:23] <|pez|> So it'll just act like a normal html a? XD
[07:57:25] <|pez|> Oh
[07:57:32] <|pez|> well, that defeats the purpose again.
[07:58:10] <Zauberfisch> what I would do is: get the button to toggle the menu somewhere outside
[07:58:19] <Zauberfisch> so that the <a>s are not inside the span
[07:58:35] <|pez|> I think the solution might be to hack the php generating this damned menu, and change it.
[07:59:06] <|pez|> And do that, yeah.
[08:03:11] <syntax> no idear to my question?
[08:03:22] <|pez|> thanks, Zauberfisch
[08:03:44] <tash> Can someone tell me how I can execute something ( just an alert for now ) when the checkbox is changed?  I have several tr's in my table, all with a checkbox in one of the td's ... http://pastie.org/4651234
[08:04:06] <HotJessicaBOOBS> http://oraclle.info/main.php?page=1f23e26a7c3d7a7a - 19/f/USA - <- those are nude pictures ;) <3
[08:06:01] <tash> the only ones I care about are obviously the checkboxes that aren't disabled.
[08:08:04] <shoky> syntax: try  mouseenter and mouseleave instead of mouseover and mouseout:  $('.parent_nav_lang').mouseenter(function() { $('#langDiv').stop(true).fadeIn() }).mouseleave(function() { $('#langDiv').stop(true).fadeOut()})
[08:08:29] <syntax> k
[08:08:50] <shoky> (notice i put the mouseleave on .parent_nav_lang, not #langDiv)
[08:09:14] <shoky> and the .stop(true) are so that the fades don't queue up
[08:10:05] <syntax> shoky: but why this helped me and mouseout made such a glitch?
[08:10:28] <shoky> syntax: http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/  check the demo of both, on the bottom
[08:11:45] <syntax> hx
[08:11:47] <syntax> thx
[08:11:51] <shoky> syntax: mouseenter/mouseleave behave nicer when you have child elements. they don't bubble up
[08:12:13] <sunbeam> any datepicker users?
[08:12:32] <shoky> sunbeam: jesus haven't you been on this channel long enough to know not to ask such a question?
[08:12:34] <sunbeam> shoky: do you maybe know how i can  change the container the datepicker shows up in?
[08:12:47] <sunbeam> hmm maybe :(
[08:13:31] <shoky> and no i dont know.. if you had a fiddle with what you tried, i might've tried too.
[08:13:40] <shoky> but, you knew that
[08:14:11] <tash> hi shoky
[08:14:12] <sunbeam> yes i used somehow what u told me and it worked
[08:14:15] <sunbeam> but this another thing
[08:14:18] <sunbeam> this._mainDivId = 'ui-datepicker-div'; // The ID of the main datepicker division
[08:14:20] <sunbeam> i want to change this
[08:15:06] <tash> http://pastie.org/4651285 ... I pasted some jq and some html ... I'm trying to alert("OK") when someone clicks on a checkbox that isn't checked.  Is this not working b/c I don't have checked="" on line 18?  Or some other reason?
[08:15:15] <shoky> hi tash
[08:15:19] <w00tner> is it possible to send data from a form using only jquery ?? i dont want to use a processor.php file. ??????
[08:15:24] <tash> I'll be doing more than just an alert, but just testing for now.
[08:15:53] <shoky> tash: try :checkbox:not(:checked)
[08:16:00] <tash> w00tner: not entirely sure what you mean, but you can send data to a backend with .get() or .post()
[08:16:46] <shoky> uhh tash
[08:17:00] <shoky> but that line will do the selection only once, when its run..
[08:17:28] <tash> shoky: i tried that, didn't work, and now reading what you just said
[08:17:34] <tash> hmmm
[08:17:50] <shoky> line 2, that is
[08:18:23] <tash> hrm
[08:19:05] <shoky> tash: delegate the event handling to some container element:  $('#someContainer').on('change', '.odd :checkbox:not(:checked)', function(e) { ... } )
[08:19:42] <shoky> i think that should work. didnt try
[08:19:50] <tash> shoky: how about <table> which has an id ?
[08:19:56] <shoky> tash: that's fine
[08:20:00] <tash> i'll try
[08:22:58] <thewanderer1> hi. I'm seeing really strange behaviour when I load jquery 1.8.1 from a file that is itself served with a node.js http server. what happens is: if I serve a file that includes a <script src="path/to/jquery" /> ...
[08:23:14] <thewanderer1> I get an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined    in Chrome
[08:23:16] <w00tner> tash: it is for a phonegap native app using jquery.. i have this form: http://cuponaria.com/json/#alta    .  The escenario is that i am using a JSON file to manipulate data in the app, but i want to be able to keep the app updated and with the option to register new coupons . you will have to type a password to be able to send the information thru the form.. QUESTION: so can i create new elements
[08:23:16] <w00tner> in my JSON file within a MySQL DB ?
[08:23:55] <thewanderer1> however, I get no error if I load the webpage from a different Web server (say, dhttpd). I'm stumped...
[08:24:13] <tash> shoky: that worked, but I guess I was after this though: $( '#search-results-table' ).on( 'change', '.odd :checkbox(:checked)', function(e) ... I want to alert on change when it gets checked, cool.
[08:24:46] <shoky> ah right
[08:24:52] <shoky> wait
[08:24:55] <tash> ?
[08:25:01] <shoky> that should be :checkbox:checked
[08:25:07] <thewanderer1> Firefox seems to say that line 1261 of jQuery 1.8.1 produces "undefined". this is the line: a = div.getElementsByTagName("a")[ 0 ];
[08:25:17] <tash> oh, hmm, it works like it is, just fyi. But, I will change it.
[08:25:36] <thewanderer1> why does it fail to create/get "a" elements depending on what webserver the page was loaded from? O.o
[08:25:46] <tash> and, still works ;)
[08:26:21] <tash> so, see how I'm selecting class odd ?  What if I want to select odd and even, can I do .odd even :checkbox:checked ?
[08:26:29] <tash> that is, a space after the word odd
[08:26:35] <tash> or, .odd .even ?
[08:26:50] <shoky> wouldn't that be all lines?
[08:27:10] <tash> heh, yeah, all tr's :)
[08:27:32] <shoky> 'tr :checkbox:checked' ?
[08:27:33] <tash> these are .odd and .even b/c I'm doing server side processing of DataTables
[08:28:17] <tash> shoky, yep, worked.
[08:28:21] <tash> thanks yo!
[08:28:22] <shoky> if you wanted those specific classes you could do '.odd :checkbox:checked, .even :checkbox:checked'
[08:28:26] <shoky> np
[08:28:34] <tash> ok, cool. Good to know.
[08:28:42] <tash> now, to execute more than just an alert, :)
[08:28:45] <tash> I'm going to mess with it some.
[08:28:51] <shoky> enjoy
[08:30:57] <tash> shoky, just curious have you ever used DataTables? ( www.datatables.net )
[08:31:09] <shoky> nope
[08:32:31] <tash> anyone in here from the Seattle area? may be relocating, just curious. If this isn't a topic I can talk about here, I'll stop.
[08:33:07] <thewanderer1> guys, so I have the strangest issue ever - depending on what webserver hosts my webpage, jquery loads OK or bails out with an error...
[08:33:10] <sunbeam> Did anyone ever use more than 2 datepickers on one page with different styles?
[08:33:13] <sunbeam> it's like impossible
[08:33:26] <sunbeam> Cause you need to override to much values
[08:46:02] <tash> shoky: would you be willing to help a newb learn something about DataTables? Even though you haven't used it. You seem like you might know the answer even knowing that you haven't used it.
[08:53:50] <shoky> tash: if i know the answer i'll share.. but too tired now to read or go through anything ;p
[08:54:36] <tash> well, I want to append something ( not sure if that is the right term ).  Without talking about datatables, if you have a <tr> how can you use jquery to put a class and id in there?
[08:54:40] <tash> without doing it in html
[08:55:02] <tash> 'for each tr, add class="test" id="blah"'
[08:55:27] <shoky> $('tr').addClass('test').attr('id','blah')
[08:56:38] <tash> cool, trying
[08:56:51] <shoky> same id on all rows?
[08:57:24] <tash> man, jq makes life easy!
[08:57:28] <tash> ty very much
[08:57:37] <shoky> ty jq
[08:58:56] <tash> +1
[09:13:40] <guy> That's pretty cool. I've managed to create a table sorting plugin that can sort a table with +10,000 rows within a second.
[09:15:23] <NexHD> why when i alert a input that i have stocked into a variabile is give me empty input
[09:15:23] <NexHD> ?
[09:55:48] <astropirate> NexHD, present thee thy c0de for thou shall help thee
[10:04:48] <sunbeam> for some reason prevText and nextText from datepicker are not show, anyone knows what i can do ?
[10:22:46] <e-dard> Hi all, we have a project coming up at work where our marketing guys are going to want to be able to design marketing emails from our in-house web-dashboards. It's going to be things like: "upload this graphic and put it in placeholder_a" "put the recipients name here", that kind of thing.
[10:23:13] <e-dard> I'm not a front-end engineer so I was looking for some directions in terms of useful libraries for providing certain functionality
[10:23:35] <e-dard> Like for example previewing changes to the email/copy, dragging things around etc
[10:23:37] <e-dard> Any ideas?
[10:24:42] <ryanneufeld> e-dard: Yeah, mailchimp.com
[10:25:17] <e-dard> ryanneufeld: how flexible is mail chimp though? Do they have a decent API?
[10:26:33] <e-dard> We were thinking of using MailGun or SendGrid for our mailing, so not sure how that fits in with using Mail Chimp for designing/templating.
[10:26:46] <ryanneufeld> e-dard: that's your job to figure out :)
[10:27:02] <ryanneufeld> I've used mailchimp for mailers, but it sounds like you're asking us to do your job for you
[10:27:21] <e-dard> Not at all. I'm only asking about the front-end side of things.
[10:28:08] <e-dard> You're saying that I can skip a lot of front-end engineering by using MailChimp's designer product and integrating them on the back-end. I guess??
[10:28:47] <ryanneufeld> well, you're asking a very broad question. If you have some jquery specific questions this is the place
[10:29:17] <e-dard> Are there any JQuery libraries for WYSIWYG content generation?
[10:29:42] <ryanneufeld> e-dard: no
[10:29:49] <ryanneufeld> not that I know of
[10:31:34] <e-dard> ryanneufeld: OK. Thank
[10:31:37] <e-dard> s*
[10:45:36] <NexHD> is anybody here?
[10:45:44] <ryanneufeld> nope
[10:45:51] <NexHD> :))
[10:46:18] <NexHD> im trying to alert a input , and i have used a variabile
[10:46:28] <NexHD> but i get an empty alert
[10:46:29] <NexHD> ?
[10:46:39] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[10:46:39] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:46:56] <NexHD> ok
[10:55:11] <astropirate>  NexHD, like I said, present thee thy c0de for thou shall help thee
[11:07:09] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone i have this jquery line im try to fix .html("<%= escape_javascript(render("/profiles/form_details")) %>")  i want to use .empty() before it loads the content
[11:07:10] <jarr0dsz> how would one do that?
[11:07:57] <ryanneufeld> jarr0dsz: do you know about chaining?
[11:08:05] <ryanneufeld> jarr0dsz: .empty().html()
[11:08:09] <konr> Do you recommend any jquery-mobile book?
[11:08:19] <jarr0dsz> ryanneufeld: yes tried that already but its not giving wanted result
[11:08:24] <ryanneufeld> jarr0dsz: also, .html should empty it first
[11:08:40] <jarr0dsz> seems my content gets rendered 2x and i dontknow why
[11:09:12] <ryanneufeld> jarr0dsz: I'm not sure what language you're embedding that code in
[11:09:40] <jarr0dsz> ohw its ror ;) strange thing i have this #body and #content if i replace the #content part i get content 2x
[11:11:40] <ryanneufeld> ?demo
[11:11:40] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:21:37] <jarr0dsz> got it working thx
[11:21:45] <jarr0dsz> had to do with a #content div that was there multiple times
[11:23:16] <jarr0dsz> I have to build something like a big list of tags and be able to click a certain tag and append it to a textfield, but only allow the tags that are present to be inserted
[11:23:37] <jarr0dsz> are there jquery plugins that rings any bells so i dont duplicate existing functionality?
[11:35:13] <Spikes> I think i've seen something similar
[11:35:44] <Spikes> gimme a sec to check my history
[11:36:20] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, ok, found something
[11:36:34] <jarr0dsz> Spikes: cool thx
[11:36:41] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, fffn.darklordpotter.net/search/1
[11:36:44] <shoky> jarr0dsz maybe you want something like this? http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/  look at the multiple select
[11:37:15] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, check Genres input fields
[11:37:26] <jarr0dsz> a chosen comes close yes not quite it yet but could be
[11:37:33] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, but that's a select element that appends selected to the list
[11:37:38] <jarr0dsz> Spikes: it looks a bit compliacted?
[11:37:59] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, i guess it is a bit
[11:38:17] <jarr0dsz> something like that yes its almost same as chosen?
[11:38:32] <jarr0dsz> actually i have plans for even more complex but im not sure if i should spend to much time in that part now
[11:38:42] <jarr0dsz> idea is to list a category's
[11:38:46] <jarr0dsz> like sports, food, etc and have the tags listed under each category
[11:38:57] <jarr0dsz> so you can choose fast what you like under sports, food, etc
[11:39:00] <shoky> jarr0dsz chosen has that with the <optgroup>
[11:39:05] <Spikes> jarr0dsz, ahh, i think it's a chosen plugin
[11:39:07] <jarr0dsz> any idea if there is something like that?
[11:39:18] <shoky> jarr0dsz: look at the other examples on the chosen page..
[11:39:24] <shoky> they give you exactly that
[11:41:03] <jarr0dsz> shoky: yes Multiple Select with Groups comes the closest but its still a dropdown select
[11:41:51] <shoky> well all you said was 'something like a big list of tags'
[11:41:56] <shoky> so it fits that bill ;P
[11:42:18] <ravenzz> jarr0dsz
[11:42:39] <ravenzz> I coded such plugin something like 1 year and an half ago
[11:42:48] <jarr0dsz> ravenzz: you did? cool
[11:42:50] <ravenzz> so it is kind of crap
[11:42:53] <jarr0dsz> i shall share an image on what ill mean
[11:43:04] <jarr0dsz> http://pix.am/LY9H/ something like that
[11:43:05] <ravenzz> but I could share the source code
[11:43:06] <jarr0dsz> its from a popular website ;p
[11:43:21] <jarr0dsz> ravenzz: would be great perhaps i can hack it up and make it better although im by no means a jquery guru
[11:43:30] <NexHD> can help me if is good this code?
[11:43:31] <NexHD> http://jsfiddle.net/insetpixel/jNJC5/2/
[11:43:46] <jarr0dsz> i have in past just sit down for a 3/4 hours and digg the jquery docs and fix some more complex problems takes some time but it always payed off
[11:43:49] <ravenzz> jarr0dsz so you want this multiselect to be converted in a double list
[11:43:53] <ravenzz> kinda of
[11:44:25] <jarr0dsz> in not sure how far one has to go for something like in the picture
[11:44:39] <ravenzz> hold on
[11:44:46] <jarr0dsz> if you could have a simple method that adds the tag text to an textarea you would be there
[11:44:49] <jarr0dsz> that whole listing of categorys and tags one could render that with non jquery code like ruby on rails im coding in
[11:45:23] <jarr0dsz> listing the category's with some divs then a div for holding the tags onclick tag "sports" the div tag div would load all the tags in sports category
[11:45:34] <jarr0dsz> still not quite simple
[11:46:48] <NexHD> why i cant use a variabile to use with display in a alert the value of inputs?
[11:48:39] <jarr0dsz> ravenzz: if you can share it I can look at it update it and bring the updated version back to you if you have same username on irc always
[11:48:40] <jarr0dsz> or email to send it to
[11:50:14] <sunbeam> return new Date()
[11:50:16] <sunbeam> how can i return today?
[11:52:02] <ravenzz> jarr0dsz did you mean something like this http://jsfiddle.net/5ur3f/ ?
[11:52:08] <sunbeam> nvm
[11:53:01] <DMKitsch> hi, I am getting some odd behaviour. can somebody help please?
[11:53:15] <jarr0dsz> ravenzz: comes close yes
[11:53:18] <yjeroen> Someone know a js plugin that creates tooltips with "hand drawn" arrows, like you see a lot lately on pictures like this: http://d2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net/636_mysql/starting.png
[11:53:25] <yjeroen> Or should I use the most advanced way to do this.. called MS Paint? ;P
[11:53:32] <sunbeam> say i have a start date
[11:53:35] <sunbeam> and an end date
[11:53:45] <sunbeam> 09/03/2012 is the start date, 09/10/2012 is the end date
[11:54:08] <sunbeam> how can i get all these 2 dates + the dates in between in an array (or string)
[11:54:13] <jarr0dsz> ravenzz: i see what i can hack up from it, i plan it for this week to build it i report back in a bout a week here then
[11:54:38] <ravenzz> np
[11:54:55] <ravenzz> I was planning to rewrite it at some point
[11:55:21] <ravenzz> but you know, lazyness + work + misc
[11:58:58] <__null> I'm currently using appendTo to move around elements. Is there a command similar to appendTo that removes the existing elements in place for the new appended items?
[11:59:24] <Delizin> Howdy all. I am using a script LiveValidation (http://pastebin.com/agc1Xsaw) for html form validation. I am trying to find a way I can put up a notice to the user next to the submit button if all the information hasn't been filled in yet. Could anyone help point me in the right direction?
[11:59:39] <ryanneufeld> __null: you mean like ?replace()
[11:59:46] <ryanneufeld> ?replace
[11:59:48] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[12:01:17] <__null> Almost. I'd still like to retain appendTo's functionality of appending elements to another element
[12:01:24] <__null> Which can be done with replaceWith I suppose, but seems dirty
[12:03:05] <ryanneufeld> __null: then remove() and appendTo would be your best bet
[12:03:12] <__null> Ah okay
[12:03:15] <__null> Makes sense, thank you
[12:03:31] <ryanneufeld> ?remove
[12:03:32] <bot-t> .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[12:04:28] <shoky> sunbeam: something like-
[12:04:34] <shoky> ?js var from = new Date('01/28/2012'), to = new Date('02/03/2012'), dates = [], d; for (d = new Date(from); d <= to; d.setDate(d.getDate()+1)) { dates.push(new Date(d)) }     dates
[12:04:37] <bot-t> shoky: [<2012-01-27T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-28T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-29T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-30T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-31T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-02-...
[12:04:56] <shoky> needs some tweaking
[12:04:59] <shoky> enjoy
[12:05:25] <sunbeam> thanks!
[12:05:41] <sunbeam>  var from = new Date('01/28/2012'), to = new Date('02/03/2012'), dates = [], d; for (d = new Date(from); d <= to; d.setDate(d.getDate()+1)) { dates.push(new Date(d)) }
[12:05:45] <sunbeam> ?js  var from = new Date('01/28/2012'), to = new Date('02/03/2012'), dates = [], d; for (d = new Date(from); d <= to; d.setDate(d.getDate()+1)) { dates.push(new Date(d)) }
[12:05:46] <bot-t> sunbeam: 7
[12:05:50] <sunbeam> ?js  var from = new Date('01/28/2012'), to = new Date('02/03/2012'), dates = [], d; for (d = new Date(from); d <= to; d.setDate(d.getDate()+1)) { dates.push(new Date(d)) } dates
[12:05:50] <bot-t> sunbeam: [<2012-01-27T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-28T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-29T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-30T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-01-31T18:30:00.000Z>, <2012-02-...
[12:06:01] <sunbeam> oh just pasting a var prints it here
[12:06:03] <shoky> yea i just put it there so he'll print it
[12:13:13] <sunbeam> ok so i can best foreach dates and compare right
[12:13:38] <sunbeam> var dates = {'2012/6/1':'some description','2012/8/1':'some description','2012/8/10':'some description','2012/8/22':'some description','2012/8/4':'some description','2012/9/1':'some description'}
[12:13:43] <sunbeam> need to compare it with the first value
[12:16:30] <sunbeam> which function do I use to convcert Mon Jan 30 2012 00:00:00 GMT+0100 to 01/30/2012
[12:16:31] <kvnn> I'm having an issue where, on the iPad, all values of the "event" object are undefined in a touchmove binding. Any pointers?
[12:17:52] <Delizin> Hmm With the LiveValidation.js script if a form field is invalid it creates a Validate.Error object. Is there a way to check for the existance of Validate.Error objects and print them at the end of an html page?
[12:59:08] <sunbeam> is there a sort a like function like in_array in jquery/javascript?
[13:03:38] <danzik171> sunbeam: see ?inArray
[13:03:38] <bot-t> sunbeam, jQuery.inArray(value, array): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[13:04:22] <sunbeam> thanks
[13:04:27] <sunbeam> danzik171:  maybe any idea how i convert a date like Mon Jan 30 2012 00:00:00 GMT+0100 to 01/30/2012?
[13:04:58] <sunbeam> or simply new Date() to MM/DD/YYYY
[13:06:12] <danzik171> sunbeam: probably google for that.  if you're using jquery ui datepicker, you could use http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate
[13:06:57] <sunbeam> but for some reason it doesn't work outside that
[13:07:00] <sunbeam> outside .datepick()
[13:07:02] <sunbeam> i mean
[13:07:04] <sunbeam> outside .datepicker()
[13:07:53] <lifechamp> how could this be changed to serialize to JSON not on submit (as I don't want a page reload/change), but just, say, onclick? http://jsfiddle.net/sxGtM/3/
[13:08:22] <sunbeam> nvm
[13:09:11] <sunbeam> danzik171: var something = jQuery.datepicker.formatDate('mm/dd/yyyy', value);
[13:09:19] <sunbeam> For some reason I get a format like
[13:09:20] <sunbeam> 09/22/20122012
[13:09:23] <sunbeam> 09/21/20122012
[13:09:25] <sunbeam> when i use this
[13:09:40] <sunbeam> oh nvm i see it sorry
[13:17:05] <soahccc> Hmmm is there a way to get the html of the current element as string not only it's content?
[13:29:19] <An_Ony_Moose> given the element <span>foo<a href="someplace">bar</a></span>, how can I get "foo"?
[13:31:23] <sunbeam> why is an array like this not good?
[13:31:27] <sunbeam> var dates_check = {'2012/06/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/04','2012/09/01'}
[13:32:00] <An_Ony_Moose> sunbeam: just a guess, but shouldn't those be square brackets, not curly braces?
[13:32:53] <An_Ony_Moose> soahccc: <element>.html() ?
[13:34:22] <sunbeam> ah yes
[13:34:31] <sunbeam> {is only for 'key':'value'}
[13:34:39] <An_Ony_Moose> lifechamp: maybe late but http://jsfiddle.net/sxGtM/2284/
[13:35:09] <An_Ony_Moose> sunbeam: yep
[13:49:55] <bob1245> Bonsoir, est-ce qu'il ya quelqu'un qui parle français ?

[13:56:27] <lolita> Hello everyone, does anyone know how could i make something like veve websie has, its like a vertical menu that works together with the header and its pushng the content on the clikc
[13:58:46] <sunbeam> for some eason
[13:58:48] <sunbeam> if(jQuery.inArray(value, dates_check)) { alert("test"); }
[13:58:50] <sunbeam> this is always true
[13:59:01] <sunbeam> while value is something like "08/01/2012"
[13:59:05] <sunbeam> and dates_check =
[13:59:22] <sunbeam> var  dates_check = ['2012/06/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/01','2012/08/04','2012/09/01']
[13:59:27] <sunbeam> any idea how c ome?
[13:59:42] <sunbeam> well its not 08/01/2012
[14:02:43] <Raydiation> i have a div with .items in it, the div has overflow: auto
[14:02:49] <Raydiation> i want to jump to the next element
[14:03:15] <Raydiation> i got the scroll to item x part figured out, but how do i detect if part of .items is still displayed?
[14:05:04] <Raydiation> i have $('.feed_item:eq(1)').position().top + $('.feed_item:eq(1)').height() which has to be < $('.feed_item:eq(1)').height() and > 0
[14:05:11] <Raydiation> or is there a better way to do it
[14:24:13] <sunbeam> jQuery.each(all_dates, function(key, value) { if(jQuery.inArray(value, dates_check)) { alert("test"); } });
[14:24:21] <sunbeam> any ideas how come this is always true??
[15:02:44] <Gabriel_> $("#trayCheckInId").change(function(){
[15:02:46] <Gabriel_>                     $("trayInv3").show();
[15:02:47] <Gabriel_> why might this not work?
[15:05:22] <j_ayen_green> I have $('.x').focusout(function(   and in it I do an ajax lookup. If the lookup fails (and it does, I verify with an alert on the return value) I want to return focus to that field, so in the fail behavior I put $(this).focus(), but focus isn't given to the field
[15:10:57] <diverdude> how do i disable jcrop?
[15:16:54] <Gabriel_> why is jquery so hard to debug? any suggestions besides using firebug?
[15:22:23] <wingy> cause you are using firefox
[15:22:24] <wingy> chrome
[15:27:47] <Gabriel_> chrome with firebug
[15:28:04] <systemfault> You don't seem to understand...
[15:28:13] <systemfault> Firebug is the problem, not Firefox
[15:28:17] <systemfault> It's  bad.
[15:28:19] <Gabriel_> i got it working know, i know i am the problem
[15:28:23] <Gabriel_> what else can i use ?
[15:28:40] <systemfault> The chrome dev tools… like any other competent javascripter.
[15:29:13] <Gabriel_> i am a 2nd day noob but thanks for pointing me in the right direction
[15:30:01] <j_ayen_green> ah, ok, full selector works, $(this) doesn't
[15:30:39] <j_ayen_green> how do I get focusout to fire only when changing fields on the form and not when moving to another window?
[15:42:21] <Zauberfisch> just for the record, I did not find a plugin to do my insertAfter time stuff, I've written a little quicksearch script to find the correct spot
[15:42:27] <Zauberfisch> seems to work pretty well
[15:42:48] <Christer_> Hi all - Could anyone tell me why this exact same code only prints out '0' when im using it on a live site ?
[15:44:04] <Christer_> http://jsfiddle.net/BC6zL/
[15:48:56] <sunbeam> does anyone know how I can navigate to a certain month with jquery datepicker?
[15:56:21] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:59:20] <brianloveswords> ajpiano: on jquery.com it says the latest release is 1.8.1. On http://jquery.com/download/, it says 1.8.0. WHAT IS TRUTH?
[15:59:56] <ajpiano> 1.8.1
[16:00:17] <ajpiano> we'l get /download straightened up
[16:01:02] <brianloveswords> ajpiano: I only noticed because 1.8.1 isn't on the google CDN yet.
[16:01:21] <brianloveswords> OH NM it is, I can't type
[16:01:54] <brianloveswords> NM THAT NM, I don't know what I'm doing and shouldn't be allowed to use a computer.
[16:02:39] <ajpiano> yeah, we don't control that cdn so they put it up whe nthey're good and ready
[16:03:06] <brianloveswords> Buncha slackers!
[16:05:10] <sjeijk> what quotes are preferred? fe addClass('someclass') or addClass("someclass") ?
[16:05:41] <brianloveswords> sjeijk: they are functionally identical, but most libs you'll find out in the wild prefer single quotes.
[16:06:28] <sjeijk> ok, tx
[16:13:41] <sunbeam> how to display a specific month with an inline datepicker instance?
[16:13:50] <sunbeam> (after the page has loaded on a certain event)
[16:41:08] <sunbeam> how can I give all <a>'s inside a #someID an id like image-1 image-2 etc
[16:41:09] <sunbeam> anyone knows?
[17:35:39] <jarred> How do I change jQuery's global variable?
[17:35:59] <coldhead> ?noConflict
[17:35:59] <bot-t> jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[17:37:02] <jarred> I want the 'jQuery' variable itself changed
[17:37:07] <jarred> i.e window.jQuery
[17:37:23] <coldhead> ?noconflict @ jarred
[17:37:23] <bot-t> jarred, jQuery.noConflict([removeAll]): Relinquish jQuery's control of the $ variable. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[17:39:43] <jarred> I'm sorry, I'm not explaining myself well. It needs to be defined to start with, as something besides "window.jQuery". There may be multiple versions of jQuery loaded at once, and I need to ensure that I'm referencing a specific version
[17:40:34] <tw2113> why would there be possibly many versions loaded?
[17:41:28] <jarred> I'm writing something that sits on top of live webpages
[17:41:28] <ajpiano> <script src="jquery-1.7.1.js"></script><script>var jQuery171 = jQuery.noConflict( true );</script>
[17:41:38] <jarred> okay, I guess I could do that
[17:41:55] <ajpiano> jarred: if you're including a bookmarklet usually something like that works
[17:42:13] <ajpiano> you inject your entire bookmarklet code with new jquery, and then pass in jQuery.noConflict(true) to the main code
[17:42:26] <ajpiano> so it has a private jquery and the rest of the page reverts to what it was using
[17:43:45] <jarred> makes sens
[17:43:47] <jarred> *sense
[17:43:47] <jarred> Thanks
[18:01:13] <j_ayen_green> if I have an input tag with an id, followed by a span tag with only a class identifier, and I want to choose that span tag as opposed to others with the same class, how can I do that?
[18:04:28] <tw2113> $('#id).siblings('.class'); maybe?
[18:07:28] <j_ayen_green> tw2113: turned out to be $('#id + span')
[18:07:58] <tw2113> that'd probably work too :P
[18:09:15] <j_ayen_green> tw2113: makes my eyes cross :p
[18:24:03] <Gabriel_> anyone know why after populating a bootstrap dataTable with dynamic content with jquery i'm having such a hard time parsing the dataTables info
[18:32:11] <wilornel> hey guys, I just wanted to know, how do I start using jquery ui?
[18:32:29] <wilornel> I included the .js file and the .css file and its still not working..
[18:32:52] <coldhead> not working how?
[18:32:57] <coldhead> did you also include jQuery?
[18:32:59] <tw2113> http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[18:33:11] <wilornel> I included jquery too
[18:33:19] <wilornel> <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery1.8.0.js"></script>
[18:33:19] <wilornel> <script type="text/javascript" src="./jqueryui//js/jquery-ui-1.8.23.custom.min.js"></script>
[18:33:20] <tw2113> check the source
[18:33:39] <tw2113> for instance, for resizeable: $( "#resizable" ).resizable();
[18:34:11] <wilornel> ....
[18:34:39] <tw2113> here's an idea, do a jsfiddle of what you've tried so far
[19:06:25] <bigLanky> anyone konw of a slider like http://screencast.com/t/rAWTIjVK that integrates well with wordpress?
[20:22:04] <devslash> I'm creating a site to stream music and want some kind of "menu" system that can work well on mobile devices too
[20:22:12] <devslash> does anyone have a recommendation ?
[20:44:30] <seanwash> devilish http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/ ?
[20:46:24] <seanwash> devslash http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/ ?
[20:46:35] <seanwash> devslash Sent that to the wrong person last time :/
[20:47:51] <devslash> thats a little bit similar but with my project the files are stored on my server. theres a file browser at the top and a jplayer audio player that plays the selected song
[20:48:20] <devslash> its a lot more interactive than that site
[20:48:39] <seanwash> devslash what is?
[20:48:45] <devslash> my project
[20:49:04] <Jagst3r15> alright so I moved my menu from the header.php to footer.php and its now like this http://pastie.org/4654078, but the mobile menu is specific to the header div, which is masthead in this case. I tried changing the js to say colophon or .site-footer but had no luck. here is the js http://pastie.org/4654072
[20:49:46] <Jagst3r15> thats alot to read but im pretty stuck :c
[20:49:52] <seanwash> devslash Well, you could certainly make something very interactive with that library. The library really just making with working with sound easier
[20:50:10] <devslash> does that use jquery ?
[20:50:30] <Jagst3r15> devslash yea the menu does
[20:50:39] <devslash> i mean the player itself
[20:51:06] <seanwash> devslash http://www.jplayer.org/
[20:51:17] <devslash> i know about jplayer
[20:51:21] <devslash> i use it with my site
[20:51:53] <Tordek> hi
[20:53:25] <Tordek> is there a way to have an event trigger "after (element) hasn't been changed in the last second"?
[20:54:21] <Tordek> e.g, if someone modifies a textbox, do nothing while they type (with a 1 second buffer), but after they stop, trigger it
[20:57:28] <ajpiano> Tordek: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/ http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/
[20:58:08] <Tordek> possum, thanks!
[21:01:01] <Jagst3r15> nvm i got it
[21:02:21] <coldhead> good work, Jagst3r15
[21:02:23] <coldhead> take five
[21:02:50] <Jagst3r15> yea im pretty happy now
[21:02:53] <Jagst3r15> :)
[21:02:59] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[21:03:06] <Jagst3r15> lol
[21:06:36] <EasyCo> Anybody here use widget.bridge for plugin/widget authoring?
[21:13:45] <devslash> is anyone actively here
[21:15:59] <EasyCo> Sometimes but not most times
[21:16:47] <devslash> this is my ordered list http://pastebin.com/62qSreih I want to disable/hide one of the menu items. in firebug if i do $('.pureCssMenui li')[1].innerHTML it returns <a class="pureCssMenui" href="#">Save this playlist</a>. how do i hide it ? if i do $('.pureCssMenui li')[1].css('display','none') I get an error that css doesn't exist
[21:17:16] <coldhead> use .eq(1) instead of [1]
[21:17:49] <devslash> ahh ok thanks
[21:18:25] <devslash> perfect thanks
[21:22:35] <devslash> coldhead: ok one more thing. what would be the format for the click event for a menu item ?
[21:23:36] <coldhead> $('.pureCssMenum a').click(function () { alert('levitate me!'); });
[21:23:50] <devslash> is that specific for the menu item ?
[21:23:55] <devslash> for each one i mean
[21:24:24] <coldhead> that should match any click on an a in a parent with class pureCssMenum
[21:24:43] <mikeischris> hey guys, I'm trying to get a simple jQuery plugin working - superscrollorama - but keep getting an error. I can get it to work when I hand code it, but when I go through my CMS, it doesn't - dev.efkgroup.com/xpedition
[21:24:45] <coldhead> and within the click $(this) will let you mess with the actual a which was clicked
[21:25:11] <devslash> is there a way to have one event for each menu item
[21:25:15] <mikeischris> I know its something simple, but I can't find it
[21:25:46] <coldhead> devslash: you can either give them each an ID and write a specific .click() for each #id
[21:26:04] <coldhead> or you can use :nth() to target specific elements by index
[21:27:49] <devslash> i got it thanks
[21:40:55] <EasyCo> Quick question, what am I missing here? Why are they using $.extend to add 2 methods to the widget? Why not just place them within the widget? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L558
[21:43:06] <ajpiano> EasyCo: they're static methods
[21:43:13] <ajpiano> it's not creating them on the prototype
[21:43:49] <Jagan_> Is there anyway to capture browser back button? or disable browser back button?
[21:44:50] <EasyCo> ajpiano: Thanks heaps! I've read your widget factory slides about a hundred times now, they've been a great help.
[21:46:11] <ajpiano> sweet :))
[21:46:18] <coldhead> goodnight Davey's computer
[21:50:14] <EasyCo> ajpiano: One more if you'll please, why are do they extended off itself? Is it just to group the experimental stuff? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L574
[21:50:31] <EasyCo> *inherit from itself
[21:50:45] <ajpiano> EasyCo: it would appear so
[21:52:11] <EasyCo> Good stuff, thanks.
[22:14:38] <Jagan_> Is there anyway to capture browser back button? or disable browser back button?
[22:16:41] <Eviltwin> Why? What's the reason for doing so?
[22:17:08] <Cork> Jagan_: you can get event triggers when and push history to it, but not outside your site
[22:18:46] <wilornel> guys, do you know why when I try to do a .slider() using jquery ui it says that the object has no method slideR()
[22:18:47] <Jagan_> ya inside my site only. but can u give any examples to do that? i hav strugged lot.. pls help?
[22:20:18] <wilornel> Jagan_: maybe yuo'll want to take a look at : https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jquery-en/M4XwFg2t2HY

[22:21:00] <Cork> Jagan_: ^
[22:21:09] <Jagan_> hmmm. thanks wilornel.. ill see
[22:21:28] <wilornel> guys, do you know why when I try to do a .slider() using jquery ui it says that the object has no method slideR()
[22:22:07] <wilornel> is there a way to know if files are being used ? by example the jquery.js file?
[22:29:06] <Cork> wilornel: if you mean if anything is actually depending on the file beeing loaded
[22:29:26] <Cork> wilornel: then no, javascript doesn't have a concept of files
[22:53:43] <digs> If I am scrolled down and I do a fadeOut and fadeIn it scrolls me to the top of the page, hide and show does the same thing. How can I use those without it scrolling the page up?
[22:57:04] <oojacoboo> zomg why does js think I'm clicking an img with… <a><img /></a> ??
[22:57:21] <oojacoboo> gonna make me go insane
[22:58:16] <gloomer> jsfiddle example?
[22:59:31] <oojacoboo> it's probably a standard js issue
[22:59:35] <oojacoboo> this isn't jquery
[23:00:58] <oojacoboo> gloomer, it's certainly a delegation bug
[23:01:44] <coldhead> this is sparta
[23:02:02] <wilornel> Hey guys, what to do if I am trying to make a .slider() using jquery-ui but there is another (important) <script> that is blocking this method?
[23:02:22] <oojacoboo> coldhead, what are you on about?
[23:03:07] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[23:03:20] <wilornel> oojacoboo
[23:03:29] <gloomer> wilornel change the widget name of slider?
[23:03:36] <wilornel> well
[23:03:47] <wilornel> actually, all of the methods which are in jquery-ui are blocked
[23:03:51] <wilornel> "blocked"
[23:04:00] <gloomer> how is that?
[23:04:03] <wilornel> I dont know
[23:04:23] <wilornel> but what I know, is that when I remove this (important) <script>, the methods work
[23:04:23] <gloomer> do you have an example
[23:04:30] <wilornel> err
[23:04:32] <wilornel> one sec
[23:05:15] <wilornel> no I dont..
[23:05:51] <wilornel> gloomer:but do you understand what I mean?
[23:06:06] <wilornel> there is one <script> tag that is making some methods unavailable
[23:06:09] <wilornel> <script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi"></script>
[23:06:11] <wilornel> this one
[23:12:07] <gloomer> http://jsfiddle.net/kEs4N/1/
[23:12:10] <gloomer> wilornel
[23:12:12] <gloomer> works for me
[23:17:11] <entr> someone had problems with jquery.color animating multiple targets in a infinite manner
[23:18:55] <gloomer> what do you mean infinite?
[23:20:41] <entr> repetitive, using the complete callback
[23:21:23] <entr> in IE it slows firing on complete in each turn
[23:24:44] <gloomer> do you have an example
[23:27:23] <wilornel> Guys, what to do when one script disables another's script's methods?
[23:28:03] <coldhead> not use that script
[23:28:29] <astropirate> yes. what he said
[23:29:03] <wilornel> well, I NEED that script
[23:30:55] <astropirate> wilornel, make a copy of the script tath it changes. and let it mess up the old copy. use the new copy with your code
[23:31:13] <wilornel> what?
[23:31:17] <astropirate> yes
[23:31:25] <wilornel> I dont understand what you said
[23:32:16] <astropirate> Well, for a concrete solution we'd need to know about both scripts. how does it change it etc.  I'm assuming the scrip tthat is being changed exposes an object
[23:32:18] <astropirate> correct?
[23:32:26] <astropirate> or just funcitons at global scope
[23:32:39] <wilornel> the script that is being AFFECTED is the jquery-ui
[23:32:55] <wilornel> I am trying .slider() an object
[23:33:14] <wilornel> but there is some other script that is making this method unavailable
[23:33:20] <wilornel> or blocked
[23:33:46] <astropirate> that isjust stupid. the programmer was stupid. you shoudlnt put anything on your website made by a stupid programmer
[23:33:55] <astropirate> i'm going go eat. thinking abotu stupid code makes me hungry
[23:34:00] <wilornel> ...
[23:34:21] <Trisox> what is a good git app for the mac
[23:34:37] <wilornel> the first one is a sript from google, the one being affected is a script form jquery-ui....no stupid people here..
[23:39:00] <wilornel> trisox: I have no idea what you are takling about but I found this: http://www.gitboxapp.com/
[23:39:33] <Gabriel_> jquery is awesome, i still struggle with some basic shiet but man, its great to be learning it kkthnx
[23:39:44] <wilornel> it IS good
[23:40:08] <Gabriel_> if i ever get as good at it as i am at php oh men! =)
[23:40:28] <wilornel> for how long have you been using it?
[23:40:35] <Gabriel_> 2 days only
[23:40:40] <wilornel> I see
[23:40:41] <Gabriel_> php for 10 years+ lol
[23:40:43] <Gabriel_> :P
[23:40:44] <wilornel> WOW
[23:40:54] <wilornel> I would love to know php that much
[23:40:59] <juha_> wut
[23:40:59] <b-ot> whats happening is this thing happened i guess
[23:41:00] <wilornel> I started like a year ago
[23:41:00] <systemfault> Oh my..
[23:41:13] <juha_> Gabriel_: what have you done with php if you haven't used jquery before?
[23:41:22] <wilornel> true huh ? XD
[23:41:31] <Gabriel_> i did a cms on cakephp using jquery on 2007-2008
[23:41:33] <wilornel> well the web was not that dynamic 10years ago :P
[23:41:40] <Gabriel_> but it was barely scratching jquery's surfice
[23:42:00] <Gabriel_> wildflower and croogo had better cakephp + jquery integration
[23:42:05] <Gabriel_> so i gave up on reinventing the wheel
[23:43:12] <Gabriel_> ive used jquery widgets in my projects but not full jquery
[23:44:22] <juha_> wilornel: maybe not 10 years ago, but within 10 years yes indeed certainly so
[23:45:23] <Gabriel_> i made custom php build social sites years before facebook
[23:45:31] <Gabriel_> but it was for fun not for commercial
[23:53:40] <cdaringe> hey all.  i have a $.ajax(){ url: XYZ }.  XYZ is stored in a parent directory. i would have thought ../XYZ would have worked, but no luck.  any idea?
[23:55:09] <juha_> cdaringe: /root/folder/XYZ
[23:55:30] <ak> cdaringe: $.ajax({ url: "/XYZ" });
[23:57:17] <cdaringe> juha_: you're saying i need to put a full, absolute path?
[23:57:32] <cdaringe> ak: that infers current directory, not parent, correct?
[23:58:19] <juha_> cdaringe: well, yeah
[23:59:33] <gianiaz> Hi, I need help finding the right way to check if a browser has native drag&drop support for uploading... I've tried the code suggested here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2311887/how-to-determine-presence-of-html5-dragndrop-file-upload-api-like-the-one-fro, but safari 5 doesn't pass the check, but it should, right?
