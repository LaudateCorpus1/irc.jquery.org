[00:47:56] <auvajs> https://jsfiddle.net/ecspgd8w/ is there a way how to select the immediately preceding element regardless if it's sibling or parent?
[00:48:27] <auvajs> to get 'time' for 'title' in my example
[01:30:17] <Cork> auvajs: just use prev() no need for a selector
[01:30:44] <Cork> auvajs: btw title isn't valid in that position (there is only allowed to be one title element and it is in the document head)
[03:25:55] <auvajs> Cork: ok, tnx
[04:54:29] <rindolf> Hi all! When I select only the "tabs widget" here and press Download I get a cloudflare error: https://jqueryui.com/download/#!version=1.12.1&components=100000010001000000000000000000100000000000000000 . Moreover, is there a way to generate a similar custom packing using the cmd line (nodejs/etc.)?
[04:58:26] <rindolf> Seems like a known issue: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/550
[05:08:07] <rindolf> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/ - this seems out of date - still requires node 0.x
[05:32:35] <Cork> jquery ui has basically been dead for the last few years
[05:32:57] <Cork> there is a developer working on putting life back into it, donno how that has gone though
[05:51:44] <rindolf> Cork: ah
[05:54:21] <afidegnum> I'm having difficulty applying the toggle-close on the top right icon on: https://consulg.ga/
[05:54:24] <afidegnum> while following the documentation, i have loaded a custom js code at: https://consulg.ga/sites/all/themes/versh/js/custom.js
[05:54:27] <afidegnum> what am i doing wrong ?
[05:55:30] <rindolf> Cork: thanks for the reply
[05:56:55] <Cork> afidegnum: what is $this).next() ?
[05:57:09] <Cork> * $(this).next() ?
[05:57:36] <afidegnum> where?
[05:58:54] <afidegnum> Cork: i can't locate what you are refering to, which js ?
[05:59:10] <Cork> in the click handler you asked about
[06:00:46] <afidegnum> ok,
[06:00:56] <afidegnum> i'm trying trace it back
[06:09:35] <afidegnum> Cork: this is my new update but unsucessful https://consulg.ga/sites/all/themes/versh/js/custom.js
[06:44:39] <rindolf> Cork: thanks! patching the jquery-ui repo like this seems to have worked: https://github.com/shlomif/fc-solve/blob/76ac3f68eb5c38efdff42e9970521bf5a9d8bacc/fc-solve/site/wml/src/js/jquery-ui/jquery-ui-git.patch
