[06:31:18] <thykka> rjCousineau, perhaps you could, in the global
[06:31:31] <thykka> handler, check if the event's target is that specific element
[06:31:38] <thykka> then do something else in that case
[06:32:23] <thykka> or just attach a handler to window and the element, and in the element handler prevent event propagation
[08:45:58] <codecutter> jquery validation plugin seems to add color red to the text inside the input element that sre invalid, how do i prevent this from happening?
[08:53:50] <thykka> codecutter, configure it with a custom invalidHandler? https://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/
[08:54:05] <thykka> ..or change the errorClass CSS?
[13:51:54] <luist> is there any event for window.addEventListener that triggers in the same moment as window.load() ??
[13:52:18] <robertmaxrees> i'd ask in ##javascript :)
[16:08:49] <MACscr> hmm, suggestions for line 20 where im trying to check if the element being resized contains an image? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/PLymKJ
[16:09:12] <robertmaxrees> erm
[16:09:14] <MACscr> seems no matter what, the aspect ratio is getting locked in
[16:09:26] <robertmaxrees> first off - $(this +" img" doesn't make sense :)
[16:10:01] <robertmaxrees> what is 'this' supposed to be there?
[16:10:21] <MACscr> .current_pub
[16:10:33] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[16:11:15] <robertmaxrees> wait you mean the string or the object?
[16:13:21] <MACscr> ah, i guess you are right, its the object
[16:13:26] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this).find('img');
[16:13:35] <robertmaxrees> but also:
[16:13:41] <robertmaxrees> $() always returns an object, so it's always truthy
[16:13:53] <robertmaxrees> you want $(this).find('img').length
[16:14:52] <MACscr> https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/PLymKJ
[16:14:59] <MACscr> updated, but still always returns true
[16:15:22] <robertmaxrees> then it always has an image.
[16:16:22] <MACscr> but if you click on "click on me" and try to resize, it obvously dont have an img in it
[16:16:52] <robertmaxrees> so what is "aspectRatio" supposed to do?
[16:17:08] <MACscr> keeps the ratio of the element
[16:17:24] <MACscr> true if you want to, false if you dont
[16:17:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm not even seeing that get called though.
[16:19:10] <MACscr> maybe my ignorance is in play here. instead of doing aspectRatio: true, I setup the function to do that check so that it is true only if there is an image
[16:19:16] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:19:27] <MACscr> is that the wrong way to do it?
[16:19:41] <robertmaxrees> the property may or may not allow a callbac k.
[16:19:43] <robertmaxrees> *callback
[16:20:07] <robertmaxrees> returning a boolean out of a function isn't the same as just using a boolean
[16:20:13] <robertmaxrees> the plugin has to allow it.
[16:33:06] <MACscr> hmm, so i guess i can set it after its initialized according to the docs
[16:33:55] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:34:39] <robertmaxrees> i would just initialize it correctly.
[16:34:50] <robertmaxrees> do an .each() through everything and then set from there.
[16:35:12] <MACscr> not sure i know what you mean
[16:36:07] <robertmaxrees> current code?
[16:36:19] <MACscr> https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/PLymKJ
[16:36:25] <MACscr> this is trying it after the fact
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:36:32] <MACscr> line 34
[16:36:35] <robertmaxrees> now you're changing things around lol
[16:37:12] <MACscr> well according to the docs, this looked like the correct strategy
[16:37:17] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:37:18] <robertmaxrees> resizable: $(this).find('img').length ? true : false,
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> ^ just do this in the init
[16:38:53] <MACscr> https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/PLymKJ
[16:38:57] <MACscr> well damn, that was easy
[16:39:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:39:07] <MACscr> so it worked because of shorthand?
[16:39:35] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[16:39:42] <robertmaxrees> you mean why did that work but the function didn't?
[16:39:47] <MACscr> yes
[16:40:25] <robertmaxrees> so whenever you to foo: function() {}, you're saying "store this function here to be run when they call someObject.foo()
[16:40:41] <robertmaxrees> the conditional works because it evaluates when the init happens.
[16:40:48] <robertmaxrees> ie you're not storing it there to be run later.
[16:41:05] <MACscr> that makes sense. thanks for taking the time to explain that!
[16:41:59] <robertmaxrees> to use a function, you COULD use an iife instead, but that gets unreadable real quick.
[16:48:02] <MACscr> now to figure out why my stupid ui-rotatable-handle still wont align properly with the image. Seems to care more about the internal child elements versus just being relative to the outer edge. any suggestions?
[16:48:23] <MACscr> seems to change based on the contents of the div
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> would need to see the error in action
[16:48:37] <MACscr> https://www.screencast.com/t/nTR4pnmg
[16:48:59] <MACscr> click on any of the elements there and you will see the little dot is in a different place
[16:49:26] <MACscr> the "click on me" has it in the right place
[16:49:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:50:02] <robertmaxrees> where should that dot be?
[16:50:31] <MACscr> above it
[16:51:10] <MACscr> https://www.screencast.com/t/bZiimm53a6op
[16:51:20] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:51:26] <robertmaxrees> screencasts are rarely helpful fwiw
[16:51:44] <MACscr> sorry on that first one, that was wrong
[16:51:46] <MACscr> lol
[16:52:07] <MACscr> the video was for someone else. lol
[16:52:13] <MACscr> https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/PLymKJ
[16:52:40] <MACscr> theres the code and the second screencast is just to show where i expect the dot to be
[16:55:04] <robertmaxrees> you're cramming things around all over the place.
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> have you tried with JUST the image and got rid of everything else?
[16:56:02] <robertmaxrees> started deleting things and whatnot
[17:00:24] <MACscr> im incrementally adding stuff to the test area as i get them to work as needed. Thought i had this one nailed down. Hmm.
[17:01:08] <robertmaxrees> organize your css a bit.
[17:01:14] <robertmaxrees> some funk going on there.
[17:06:55] <MACscr> seems pretty straightforward and basic css i have in that codepen. maybe the plugins have some weird stuff
[17:07:18] <robertmaxrees> i would still pare things down to JUST the image.
[17:07:28] <robertmaxrees> see if you can figure it out through simplifying
[17:11:57] <MACscr> robertmaxrees https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/KEGQmB
[17:12:08] <MACscr> though i should probably take this to #css at this point
[17:15:14] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:15:33] <robertmaxrees> why the position: relative?
[17:17:07] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're trying to treat it as an absolutely positioned element
[17:33:29] <MACscr> i got it working. yep, that was it. i think i had solved that yesterday and picked back up on the work on the wrong version of the code
[18:10:19] <maogrady_> maogrady_
[18:10:32] <robertmaxrees> lolwut
[18:46:00] <madprops> is jquery the one putting all padding declarations into a single padding statement, or is it the browser?
[22:58:48] <MACscr> before i get any farther, you think this is the right strategy for creating a list of elements so that i can click on their name in the list and highlight them? https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/ZPqqOq?editors=1111
[23:07:06] <MACscr> yep, got it element
[23:07:16] <MACscr> er, got it https://codepen.io/MACscr/pen/ZPqqOq?editors=11
[23:11:00] <MACscr> though this is an ideal situation as i would have to refactor my code to add that data attribute. I could obviously use name from inputs, but buttons typically dont have anything unique tied ot them
[23:11:03] <MACscr> to them
[23:45:52] <madprops> When I do "let element = piece.element.clone()" is piece.element affected in any way?
[23:51:47] <madprops> i guess it is
[23:51:59] <madprops> btw why isn't there an outerHTML method for jquery? it worries me
