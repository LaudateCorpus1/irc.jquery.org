[02:34:38] <starlays> Hello to all, I have the fallowing code: https://jsfiddle.net/uzboz7gk/6/ I need some help, I'm stuck now, I'm always selecting only the first textarea from the table at the moment and I need some hints on how to make the selection of current object (this) textarea.
[02:35:22] <starlays> if someone could help me would be great :(. ty
[02:43:28] <xprilion> starlays: can you please explain?
[02:49:47] <starlays> xprilion, I tried to add an explanation at the end of the code. On line #25 I'm tring to find the current object (this) textarea data-estimid value but if I go and dynamically add more textareas then the result will be always the data-estimid from the first dynamically added textarea.
[02:50:19] <starlays> s/if I go/if I go on
[02:51:28] <circ-user-eSZFP> er..Sorry I did not get the 's/if I go/if I go on'
[02:51:29] <circ-user-eSZFP> :P
[02:52:28] <xprilion_> I am checking the code :)
[02:52:33] <starlays> xprilion, I tried to add an explanation at the end of the code. On line #25 I'm tring to find the current object (this) textarea data-estimid value but if I go on and dynamically add more textareas then the result will be always the data-estimid from the first dynamically added textarea.
[02:54:40] <starlays> xprilion_, short story because I'm always slecting the data-estimID from only the first texboxarea if multiple textboxes are pressent the behaviour weird. It will remove table rows when it is not suppose to do so and it will not add for the last row the textbox
[02:56:56] <starlays> xprilion, I just need to find a way to correctly select the data-estimid for the current table row from wich the checkbox is selected, currently I'm somehow selecting only from one single textbox area the data-estimid
[02:57:24] <xprilion> starlays, got it :)
[02:57:32] <starlays> and I don't know why, because I thought It will work differently
[02:57:36] <xprilion> please wait
[02:57:37] <xprilion> :)
[02:57:41] <starlays> ok, sry

[03:19:59] <starlays> xprilion, I will examine to understand, thank you for helping me.
[04:23:13] <starlays> can someone help me in selecting the data-estimid value for the dynamically created textarea, at the moment it is always selecting the data-estimid from row 1 for the dynamically created textarea. This is what I have so far: https://jsfiddle.net/uzboz7gk/13/
[04:58:17] <kev999> Hi - working on a website that needs an oversized top menu and would like to add swipe functionality - what's the best way to do it / any examples please?
[04:58:41] <kev999> swipe in a linear - left / right fashion
[05:16:21] <Lope> this doesn't work: $('#cancelReason').parent('tbody')
[05:16:32] <Lope> this works: $('#cancelReason').parent().parent().parent();
[05:16:34] <Lope> wtf?
[05:18:04] <Lope> ah. parents with an s. $('#cancelReason').parents('tbody')
[06:45:37] <HaZrD> hey all ;)
[06:48:27] <HaZrD> i'm quite new, so please bare with me... I'm trying to select only the timer class, but keep getting everything else (which is not part of the timer class) as well... any pointers? https://jsfiddle.net/7rkttd7s/
[07:35:51] <Lope> Meteor react was only loading scss files I imported into my JSX before. Now it just loads every SCSS file into every JSX file. It's a little retarded. Any ideas if it's an optional thing?

[09:06:12] <pcyna> hi guys
[10:27:52] <creraffylin> .
[11:05:00] <codecutter> is there away to prevent a function from execution more than once within a specified timeframe, besides setTimeout(), which does not seem to work for
[11:12:24] <shoky> codecutter sounds like you want "throttle" functionality. underscore/lodash has it,  and there are stand-alone plugins that provide it
[11:13:11] <shoky> searching for "throttle debounce"  will get you many results
[11:13:16] <shoky> relevant results
[11:13:47] <codecutter> already tried something similar to http://pastebin.com/6idx1SL4
[11:14:29] <shoky> debounce is not exactly the same as throttle
[11:17:31] <codecutter> actually it works!
[11:17:35] <codecutter> setTimeout, that is
[11:18:02] <codecutter> after a retry
[11:18:33] <shoky> setTimeout sure does work ;p
[12:21:03] <banna> i have three fields, the sum of other two inputs must be equal to the third one, i want validation on blur of each field but show error only on third field
[12:21:45] <banna> i am using jquery validation plugin http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[12:42:05] <banna> i have three fields, the sum of other two inputs must be equal to the third one, i want validation on blur of each field but show error only on third field
[13:02:04] <banna> i have three fields, the sum of other two inputs must be equal to the third one, i want validation on blur of each field but show error only on third field
[13:02:18] <xebra> hi, basic question, I don't understand what's wrong with this. I want to save the result of a selector in a variable, and then use it. What I do is $elements = $('.class') to get all elements of class .whatever; then I want to manipulate only one of them, I do $elements.eq(myindex).css(...) and apparently it doesn't work
[13:08:33] <systemfault> xebra: It should work, the problem might be "time"
[13:09:16] <systemfault> jQuery selections are not live and if the selected nodes don't exist when you try selecting them, you're going to have a empty result
[13:11:03] <xebra> systemfault, damn it, how could I be so stupid. For some reason I put the initialization code outside $(document)ready(); Sorry, thanks
[13:11:20] <systemfault> I'm glad it was just that :)
[13:18:29] <mariacheline> Hi guys, anybody knows why this doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/taccLg51/
[13:18:42] <mariacheline> I can't seem to figure it out. >.>
[13:40:04] <Banna> I have three inputs, field1, field2, field3, i want sum field2 + field3 = field1, on blur validation for each field, but error be shown on field1, i am using http://jqueryvalidation.org/
[13:43:08] <Banna> i want it like equalTo works, when any of the field is changed, it gives the error on confirm password
[14:42:56] <carpii> in jQuery UI, is there a way to have the select pop up the list above the control instead of below, if it would otherwise be clipped? Seems quite a fundamental oversight not to emulate this since native controls do it.
[16:25:36] <codecutter> is there a way to prevent a trigger from bubble down? stopPropagation works the other way, correct?
[16:25:49] <codecutter> event not trigger
[16:26:26] <systemfault> Wut?
[16:26:55] <systemfault> stopPropagation stops the bubbling after the current element
[16:29:54] <codecutter> i have multiple '.foo' elements, when I click on the top most element, first changes occure to the bottom one, then top. I need the changes on the first one not the bottom one (which ever one that was clicked)
[16:30:10] <codecutter> make sense?
[16:58:48] <unrecited> man I have a dumb problem with something dumb Im probably overlooking.. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/GNvEOz
[16:59:40] <unrecited> just need the element to drop down (toggle) but the head itself is disappearing and I cant figure out why
[17:01:57] <henk_> you need to remove that <script> tag in the js section first of all
[17:03:33] <unrecited> I just put that there guess theres no way to import jquery into codepen?
[17:03:52] <henk_> there is
[17:04:03] <unrecited> I just want the box to drop.. but the header .chat_head to stay visible so you can toggle it
[17:04:07] <henk_> you need to open the settings -> javascript -> quick add or add the url of jquery
[17:04:11] <unrecited> otherwise the whole box disappeared and you cant get it back
[17:04:14] <unrecited> i see
[17:04:31] <henk_> https://i.imgur.com/w4f1FIY.png
[17:04:33] <unrecited> I was thinking about it wrong, thought OK once it toggles, I can then do a 'show()'
[17:04:35] <unrecited> lol thats not right
[17:05:24] <henk_> http://codepen.io/lost-design/pen/VmzWQB
[17:05:33] <henk_> works now :p just needs jquery to be added properly
[17:06:14] <unrecited> ok
[17:06:20] <unrecited> see now how the WHOLE thing disappears
[17:06:30] <unrecited> I need just everything but the header to disappear
[17:06:45] <unrecited> so When I use .chat_body (which is what the tutorial recommended) it simply toggles the user
[17:06:56] <unrecited> then when I use .chat_box it toggles the whole box but then I cant get it back
[17:07:02] <unrecited> How Can I leave just the header visible once it drops
[17:07:24] <henk_> you should maybe use animate() and give it your properties
[17:07:56] <henk_> or 'cheat' and have another header behind the box which is only visible once the other one is going to be toggeled
[17:09:13] <henk_> or work with animate() and adding/removing css classes
[17:09:23] <unrecited> doesnt make sense though when I hide .chat_body it should only leave the header to be shown
[17:09:25] <unrecited> hm
[17:12:12] <henk_> http://codepen.io/lost-design/pen/VmzWQB
[17:12:17] <henk_> here my quick dirty solution
[17:12:35] <henk_> i only copy pasta'd the chatbox another time and put it below the main window
[17:12:46] <henk_> once the first one is toggled you only see the header
[17:12:58] <henk_> clicking the header brings back the chat windows
[17:13:01] <henk_> as example :P
[17:14:02] <henk_> 'dirty' because you can see the back layer when the first one is sliding down
[18:18:16] <LACampbell> good afternoon. I am trying to RTFM. Is there somewhere that lists all the methods a JQuery Object has? http://api.jquery.com/Types/#jQuery
[19:06:04] <LACampbell> so children() returns a jquery object. I am trying to get an array of jquery objects. why does children().toArray().map($) not do it? do I need to loop through explicitly?
[19:07:24] <LACampbell> yes it does, I was confused by pretty-printing. I need a coffee.
[19:07:57] <systemfault> .children.get() doesn't do it?
[19:08:06] <systemfault> Ahh
[19:08:08] <systemfault> Nevermind.
[19:08:31] <systemfault> Well, let's just say that I wouldn't call .map on an array with $
[19:08:39] <systemfault> Seems like an awful idea.
[19:43:41] * kof bbl
[19:53:06] <LACampbell> systemfault: Just saw that. why is calling map on an array with $ an awful idea?
[19:53:59] <systemfault> By using .toArray(), you're transforming the collection into a simple array... then you use Array#map on it. What arguments does the callback to .map expects?
[19:56:26] <systemfault> The answer is that it's called with 3 parameters, the current element, the current index and the array itself
[19:57:19] <systemfault> So, for the first element, you endup calling $ like $(domNode, 0, nodeArray) and seriously, I don't have any idea of what it's supposed to do.
[20:00:40] <LACampbell> systemfault: ah right. so I should try and keep it a jquery object all the way down
[20:01:03] <systemfault> Or at least do .map(function(node) { return $(node); })
[20:01:56] <LACampbell> I want to come up with a
[20:02:09] <LACampbell> JSON array of JSON objects at the end to send to the server.
[20:02:20] <LACampbell> so I thought about making each child its own JQuery thing
[20:02:25] <LACampbell> but I'll try and do it on the children as a batch
[20:04:00] <LACampbell> systemfault: but if you .map over a jquery object, you can't perform jquery methods on it like "find". I think I need to read a book.
[20:04:59] <systemfault> What do you want to do exactly? You get some nodes and then?
[20:07:26] <LACampbell> systemfault: convert each node to a JSON object. then return an array of JSON objects to the server
[20:08:01] <systemfault> How do you convert the nodes to JSON? Getting attributes?
[20:13:57] <LACampbell> systemfault: well that's the thing. I don't know how
[20:14:15] <LACampbell> I figure I can just keep doing query selectors until I get the data I want
[20:14:26] <LACampbell> but if I map over children(), the JQuery selectors aren't there
[20:14:33] <LACampbell> hence toArray().map($)
[20:14:47] <D-rex> jqueery.com.. is that a fake jquery site or just a mirror for mispells?
[20:15:00] <D-rex> nm
[20:15:18] <D-rex> plays club music and rainbows pop up
[20:16:48] <LACampbell> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5396ce87b5ccbdd068e4ca4751efa3bc $(".phrases").children("form") gets me what I want
[20:16:53] <LACampbell> but from there I have difficulty
[20:26:31] <systemfault> LACampbell: I don't understand the idea... couldn't you just select the form, call .serializeArray() on it and just use the output?
[20:27:51] <LACampbell> systemfault: hmmm. that gets me someway there. but I need to do some custom stuff, like grab the selected value of each select element.
[20:28:13] <LACampbell> hence why I went toArray().map($), so I could do find("select").val() or whatever
[20:29:56] <systemfault> That's what .serializeArray() does, no? Just myForm.serializeArray(). Or do you mean all the options?
[20:31:16] <LACampbell> systemfault: serializeArray() doesn't grab the selected value. just the name/value of each input element
[20:31:35] <LACampbell> it also smashes them alltogether into one array, 2 forms => 1 array of 3 elements
[20:36:57] <D-rex> LACampbell: you also need to add name="lang" or whatever you want to name the select.  i.e. <select name="lang">
[20:37:09] <D-rex> it wont recognize it as a form input without a name
[20:41:15] <LACampbell> D-rex: ah! thanks
[20:45:04] <LACampbell> $(".phrases").children("form").map(serializeArray()); gets me something I can work with. thanks so much everyone.
[20:45:31] <LACampbell> $(".phrases").children("form").toArray().map($).map(form => form.serializeArray());
[20:45:33] <LACampbell> rather
[21:21:25] <cryocaustik> Hi, All- I am wondering if someone can help me figure out why my code works in jsfiddle, but not on my local machine? my code: https://jsfiddle.net/sf2fyw20/1/
[21:21:50] <cryocaustik> I have verified in the console that the jquery libraries do load
[21:22:02] <cryocaustik> but for whatever reason, non of the functions work
[21:30:32] <cryocaustik> update: the document ready function is working, but the click on "b" is not
[21:32:41] <LACampbell> cryocaustik: full disclaimer - I am a noob that wandered in here
[21:32:51] <cryocaustik> no worries, I am too :)
[21:32:55] <LACampbell> but it could it be possible that the JFiddle is ignoring the jquery sources?
[21:33:04] <LACampbell> and is using some other version of jquery?
[21:33:16] <LACampbell> try using the CDN for both of them
[21:33:19] <cryocaustik> well in the settings of jsfiddle I pointed it to the same version
[21:33:25] <LACampbell> oh
[21:33:55] <cryocaustik> what do you mean about CDN though?
[21:34:00] <cryocaustik> like google or MS?
[21:34:38] <cryocaustik> yeah- i tried the cdn before
[21:34:44] <cryocaustik> and tried it just now as well
[21:34:50] <cryocaustik> also, the document ready function works
[21:34:58] <cryocaustik> but the onclick of <b> wont
[21:34:59] <cryocaustik> =/
[21:43:27] <LACampbell> cryocaustik: is the selector working?
[21:43:47] <LACampbell> on your local machine, if you open up the javascript console of your browser (I assume they all have them these days)
[21:43:53] <LACampbell> does $('b') return anything?
[21:44:06] <LACampbell> I took your html, got rid of all the src except for the CDN, and $('b') returned something
[21:44:31] <quechon> this code in the paste is adding the has-error class with no problem but the boxes dont change color but the text does https://paste.pound-python.org/show/58xqlFwki0ZP76iclWDB/ any suggestion with this please
[21:45:14] <LACampbell> cydrobolt: your code works in my browser if I added that click function for $('b') in the console.
[21:48:54] <cryocaustik> LACampbell: I will give it a try
[21:48:58] <LACampbell> whoops sorry cydrobolt
[21:49:04] <LACampbell> I mean cryocaustik
[21:49:07] <LACampbell> I totally figured it out
[21:49:14] <LACampbell> you need to define the click thing in the body
[21:49:27] <LACampbell> you are defining it in the header, but there's no <b> on the page yet
[21:49:35] <LACampbell> IDK why jsfiddle lets you do that
[21:51:48] <cryocaustik> LACampbell: I don't think I understand, could you provide an example?
[21:52:37] <LACampbell> cryocaustik: ok, so you know the $('b').click thing?
[21:52:45] <cryocaustik> yes
[21:52:51] <LACampbell> if you define that in the header, or load the JS for it in the header, it won't work
[21:53:00] <LACampbell> because the docmument doesn't have a <b> on it yet
[21:53:23] <LACampbell> JSFiddle presumably waits until the html is loaded before running the little javascript window
[21:53:27] <LACampbell> so it works there
[21:53:49] <cryocaustik> got it!
[21:53:56] <cryocaustik> that is very odd indeed
[21:54:05] <cryocaustik> thank you!
[21:54:14] <cryocaustik> been struggling with this issue for a while :)
[21:54:17] <LACampbell> no worries. I am new to front end web dev as well, I only just learned about that the other day
[21:54:50] <quechon> any idea guys why it isnt working
[21:56:43] <LACampbell> quechon: I'll have a look. maybe I'm on a roll :P
[21:57:52] <LACampbell> well I've never used closest or addClass, so it's beyond me
[22:01:30] <quechon> ok thanks
[22:02:03] <quechon> i mean im new with jquery at far as i know it should work
[22:02:19] <quechon> but no go ;)
[23:10:09] <e44> My jQuery width animation doesn't update the actual div. The sizes change and animations run correctly (seems to be working fine in chrome dev-tools), but the div itself won't change width unless I resize the page.
