[00:09:58] <hellyeah> hey
[00:10:01] <hellyeah> any answer for me
[00:12:15] <Uhkis> no, because you didn't ask anything
[00:12:23] <hellyeah> actually i asked
[00:12:26] <hellyeah> just a sec
[00:12:34] <hellyeah> actually i have two question :D
[00:12:43] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/3/ what did i do wrong here?
[00:13:25] <hellyeah> asked that <hellyeah> filter function is supported in IE8
[00:13:49] <Uhkis> that's a statement, not a question
[00:14:03] <hellyeah> saw my error
[00:14:14] <hellyeah> is filter function supported in ie8?
[00:14:19] <hellyeah> sorry
[00:14:49] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/4/
[00:15:35] <Uhkis> filter should work with ie8
[00:15:46] <Uhkis> keep in mind that 2.x doesn't support old browsers
[00:17:12] <hellyeah> 1.9 or 1.10 support i.e. 8
[00:17:15] <hellyeah> as far as i know
[00:19:54] <Uhkis> yup
[00:20:38] <hellyeah> do i need to es5-shim also?
[00:21:29] <Uhkis> for what
[00:21:59] <hellyeah> for cross browser issue?
[00:22:14] <hellyeah> actually for legacy ie
[00:24:13] <Uhkis> jquery 1.x supports down to ie6
[00:24:21] <mdev> ew
[00:24:59] <mdev> also is bruncol auto spamming anyone else who sends a message in here?

[01:23:56] <kokut> Hello, do i have to do something different to be able to call $(element).val(val) on a element that was populated by ajax ?
[01:24:10] <BenL90> hellyeah: That's not jquery UI but how you can make a pop up windows like it?
[01:25:14] <hellyeah> thats jquery ui
[01:25:22] <hellyeah> i dont understand.
[01:25:35] <hellyeah> i used dialog()
[01:25:46] <BenL90> hellyeah: Ouch, sorry2
[01:25:57] <hellyeah> https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[01:26:02] <hellyeah> check here
[01:26:15] <hellyeah> i included some library
[01:26:20] <hellyeah> check external resources
[01:26:24] <kokut> hey man whats the bubble thing u have to do when you want to change the value of an element that was populated by ajax?
[01:27:29] <BenL90> hellyeah: I want to ask, Can i use or in if statement on jquery then?
[01:30:32] <maidus> Uhkis: there isnt any code, my question is how to make it recalculate document height before triggering anchor link?
[01:30:46] <kokut> if i change an element with $(element).val(val) will that trigger change event?
[01:30:53] <maidus> because if i dont open any accordions
[01:31:03] <maidus> then it works
[01:45:30] <hellyeah> hey
[01:46:00] <hellyeah> do you prefer to do bt1 click function with AJAX when you click button you will get modal window http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/34/
[02:11:03] <kokut> Anyone knows how to change the selected value of a select that was populated by ajax on document ready?
[02:13:35] <abishek> I can't seem to get this working with the new version of jquery http://jsfiddle.net/j6zqN/1/. Could someone help
[02:19:30] <snobu> so, When i do set .css()
[02:22:35] <snobu> Is doing set .css() inside a change event a good idea? change gets triggered on every keystroke. I wonder if jQuery does a compare before doing the set, otherwise i think it's just wasted CPU
[02:42:15] <AdamPDotty> abishek;: maybe you need a current version of jquery-ui, too?
[02:48:03] <kokut> a lil help with this please http://goo.gl/cEsbaC change the selected value of a <select> that was populated with ajax
[03:30:53] <ifohancroft> Guys, would anyone mind assisting me in creating a dual listbox with just jQuery, HTML, CSS without a framework? I have an idea how to do it but I don't know if it's right
[03:32:08] <ifohancroft> I am thinking of having two <selects> one with the options and one empty and on click to just move the <option> from one of the <selects> to the  others and make it selected
[03:42:12] <AdamPDotty> sounds do-able
[03:42:49] <AdamPDotty> and not too complicated
[03:43:07] <ifohancroft> Yes.
[03:43:26] <AdamPDotty> you create an event handler and then select2.append(selectedOption);
[03:43:48] <AdamPDotty> I believe, this append also removes it from select1
[03:44:27] <ifohancroft> Yes, it should be removed from the select1
[03:58:36] <walabe> could someone see why my 2 scripts are seemingly conflicting one another??
[03:59:01] <walabe> they only work when they are at the bottom of the page, but obviously only one can be there so the other doesn't work
[03:59:08] <walabe> i mean just before the end </body> tage
[03:59:48] <ifohancroft> walabe: Maybe you don't have $(document).ready(function(){}); etc around your code so it needs to be after the elements are already rendered by the browser so it can work on them?
[03:59:59] <walabe> oh right
[04:00:16] <walabe> I have window.onload
[04:00:43] <hellyeah> hey
[04:00:51] <walabe> I posted the 2 scripts on here, can you take a look and see if you can see anything obvious? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31714766/2-plugins-interfering-one-wont-work-when-the-other-is?noredirect=1#comment51367092_31714766
[04:00:51] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/40/
[04:01:20] <walabe> For your information, the ZOOMWALL plugin is the one not working
[04:01:38] <Uhkis> hellyeah: you spelled specific wrong for one
[04:02:07] <hellyeah> :D
[04:02:25] <hellyeah> then
[04:03:09] <Uhkis> hellyeah: but you probably meant the part where you forgot to show() the new button
[04:03:10] <walabe> could anyone check or?
[04:04:09] <hellyeah> humm
[04:04:16] <walabe> i'm desperate
[04:05:24] <Uhkis> walabe: remove the latter window.onload
[04:05:46] <hellyeah> Uhkis: thanks http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/41/
[04:05:53] <walabe> on the zoom wall??
[04:06:02] <ifohancroft> walabe: What is it supposed to do? I checked the stack link you posted here
[04:06:14] <Uhkis> walabe: yes, just leave that zoomwall.create part
[04:06:20] <walabe> ok i will try thanks
[04:06:31] <walabe> it's just suppose to work lol, it's not seemingly 'running'
[04:06:36] <walabe> or initiating
[04:07:14] <walabe> Uhkis you are my savior
[04:07:19] <walabe> i love you
[04:07:42] <Uhkis> walabe: np
[04:10:54] <walabe> anyone used 'unslider' before
[04:10:56] <ifohancroft> When it comes to <options> in a <select> what does count as .select()?
[04:11:32] <ifohancroft> I had a perfectly working code being executed on click on one of the options but when I changed it to be on select it stopped so does clicking on an option in a select counts as a select?
[04:12:07] <taplar> ifohancroft: not sure select works in that case
[04:12:27] <taplar> ifohancroft: according to the api, it works on an input text field when selecting text
[04:12:32] <Uhkis> ifohancroft: you probably want to use change event
[04:12:48] <ifohancroft> Thank you, taplar and Uhkis
[04:15:03] <hellyeah> hey
[04:15:13] <hellyeah> is it legit to write click function with AJAX? http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/42/
[04:16:22] <taplar> i don't see any ajax
[04:16:28] <taplar> what do you mean?
[04:21:15] <hellyeah> taplar:
[04:21:17] <hellyeah> sorry
[04:21:20] <hellyeah> i asked wrongluy
[04:21:30] <hellyeah> i know for using ajax there are some cases
[04:21:38] <hellyeah> can i use AJAX for click function?
[04:21:43] <hellyeah> is therre any advantage?
[04:22:14] <taplar> you can perform ajax inside a event handler, or ajax can bind/invoke event handlers.  there's not a restriction
[04:23:03] <hellyeah> humm
[04:23:09] <hellyeah> actually i dont know mch
[04:23:21] <hellyeah> i heard you dont use ajax for everything?
[04:23:24] <taplar> no
[04:23:40] <taplar> ajax is used to get resources dynamically without having to reload the entire page
[04:24:00] <taplar> get or interact with
[04:24:11] <hellyeah> get or interact with?
[04:24:18] <hellyeah> you mean is there two ways?
[04:24:21] <taplar> i said get, but that's not a requirement
[04:24:24] <hellyeah> as you meantioned above
[04:24:31] <taplar> an ajax request could do some updation on the back end and return nothing
[04:24:52] <hellyeah> a sec
[04:31:14] <hellyeah> taplar: button is not working now but do you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/44/
[04:32:08] <taplar> success needs a function to invoke.  you have to put whatever you want to happen on success in it's own function that will execute
[04:32:47] <hellyeah> i put click function
[04:32:59] <taplar> your invoking the click function
[04:33:02] <taplar> not giving it a function
[04:33:20] <hellyeah> btw url part is correct here http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/45/
[04:33:41] <hellyeah> taplar: can you be more clear?
[04:33:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:34:59] <taplar> success: function() { /* whatever i want to happen */}
[04:36:46] <hellyeah> so you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/47/
[04:37:31] <bruffstar> Hello everybody :)
[04:37:38] <hellyeah> bruffstar: hey
[04:38:10] <taplar> close, your missing a comma before your success option and the closing of the success function does not need a ;
[04:41:05] <hellyeah> fixed that http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/51/
[04:41:36] <hellyeah> hey
[04:42:00] <hellyeah> is there a rule like if you have success callback you should have error callback
[04:42:03] <taplar> looks ok, though url being in uppercase is iffy to me
[04:42:18] <bruffstar> I need some info from people who are a lot smarter than I am... hopefully in the right place... I am creating a plugin which requires me to force an event to the top of the list so it fires first. The only way I can access this info on an element is by using $._data($(this)[0]).events  .. I want to know how "future proof" this is as I know this changed already since  1.7. Are there any plans to officially support a similar thing, 
[04:42:24] <bruffstar> Any advice would be great
[04:42:24] <taplar> you should have an error callback if you want to do error handling
[04:43:10] <szwetsloot> Hey guys.
[04:43:31] <szwetsloot> I know this is the wrong chat, but can one of you remind me what border style property you need to make it look like an item is coming out of the page?
[04:43:43] <hellyeah> taplar: whjy is it iffy?
[04:43:44] <szwetsloot> I can't find it on google
[04:43:59] <taplar> szwetsloot: huh?  what does it look like?  like dashed lines?
[04:44:13] <szwetsloot> taplar: No, just like it is closer to you in 3D
[04:44:26] <taplar> ah, no clue
[04:44:59] <taplar> hellyeah: i believe url should be in lowercase
[04:45:15] <hellyeah> ic
[04:45:22] <taplar> it's lowercase in the api
[04:45:24] <hellyeah> seperation of concern?
[04:45:29] <hellyeah> humm
[04:45:53] <hellyeah> just checked it for using AJAX in jsfiddle http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[04:47:19] <bruffstar> I need some info from people who are a lot smarter than I am... hopefully in the right place...

[04:52:09] <Uhkis> bruffstar: stop spamming that please
[04:52:18] <taplar> bruffstar: that question would probably be better asked to the jquery developer chatroom
[04:52:27] <bruffstar> ok cool
[04:52:30] <hellyeah> which one is better bind to click event to ajax or using ajax inside event handler http://jsfiddle.net/28d2p12j/51/
[04:52:44] <taplar> hellyeah: all depends on your use case
[04:53:27] <taplar> neither is inherently better
[04:53:27] <hellyeah> what do you mean by "use cas" i am using AJAX for handling events. This is what you meant with "use case"
[04:53:27] <walabe> whats the code to get jquery to prompt something, e.g. say something to user in text
[04:53:48] <taplar> walabe: an old school alert?
[04:53:48] <hellyeah> inherently better
[04:53:53] <walabe> oh alert yeah thanks
[04:53:54] <hellyeah> so i have a sense that
[04:54:07] <hellyeah> you can do some extra thing to make one of them better
[04:54:08] <hellyeah> ?
[04:54:16] <walabe> I dunno wtf i'm doing so oldschool it is haha
[04:54:23] <taplar> no they are used at different times
[04:54:33] <taplar> alert("text to user")
[04:54:58] <Uhkis> please don't :D
[04:55:53] <taplar> if you want to go more with current day usages, look at jqueryui dialogs
[04:56:05] <walabe> oh ok
[04:56:09] <hellyeah> ahah
[04:56:19] <hellyeah> jquery dialog is cool
[04:56:45] <taplar> hellyeah: ajax to event vs event to ajax are used at different times
[04:56:58] <hellyeah> humm
[04:56:59] <taplar> it all depends on when you want your event handler to be made, and what it should do
[04:57:34] <hellyeah> sounds like i need experience
[04:57:44] <hellyeah> for deciding which one must be use
[04:57:45] <hellyeah> d
[04:58:22] <Uhkis> why are you even using ajax?
[04:58:36] <taplar> subsets of a very very large table
[04:58:54] <taplar> or so i've been told
[04:58:57] <hellyeah> thats one of my doing
[04:59:47] <hellyeah> taplar:
[04:59:54] <hellyeah> i have to do different thing everyday
[04:59:58] <hellyeah> kinda hectic here
[05:00:23] <hellyeah> i just wonder using Ajax for every js function is wise?
[05:00:32] <taplar> absolutely not
[05:00:45] <hellyeah> that what i am carious about
[05:00:49] <taplar> you don't use a hammer for every application.  only with nails
[05:00:57] <hellyeah> for using AJAX there must be some list of user case
[05:01:09] <hellyeah> may be article etc.
[05:01:18] <taplar> interacting with the backend dynamically without reloading the page
[05:01:36] <taplar> if you need to do that, use ajax
[05:01:38] <taplar> otherwise, no
[05:02:08] <hellyeah> ic
[05:02:09] <hellyeah> so
[05:02:27] <hellyeah> if you do some stuff with interacting backend
[05:02:31] <hellyeah> using ajax is okey
[05:02:35] <taplar> yes
[05:02:37] <hellyeah> so button handler doesnt need ajax
[05:02:42] <taplar> not inherently
[05:02:52] <Uhkis> it most definitely does not need ajax
[05:03:05] <hellyeah> okey
[05:03:14] <Uhkis> well, with that code at least
[05:03:15] <hellyeah> so subseting table into small table needs ajax
[05:03:25] <hellyeah> because first of all we got the table from backend
[05:03:32] <hellyeah> Uhkis:
[05:03:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:03:48] <hellyeah> i didnt see what you mean?
[05:03:53] <taplar> ajax allows you to get smaller subsets of the large table, so your not overloading the users browser with the entire table
[05:04:07] <hellyeah> ic
[05:04:25] <taplar> you could do it without ajax, with paging
[05:04:32] <kokut> Hello, how can i make a $(element).val("UTF-8 string") work? it works until i try to pass "non ASCII" chars to it
[05:04:35] <hellyeah> paging is not allowed
[05:04:41] <taplar> but what your really wanting to change is just the subsets, so ajax is a useful tool for that
[05:04:50] <hellyeah> ic
[05:05:00] <hellyeah> thanks taplar
[05:05:24] <taplar> hellyeah: what you were talking about with multiple buttons, that's pretty much paging
[05:07:11] <taplar> kokut: not entirely sure myself, but that seems like something that would rely on the pages charset, not really jquery or javascript
[05:07:23] <`ULT> hi taplar!
[05:07:28] <taplar> yo
[05:07:42] <`ULT> I try to adjust te speed of my toggle (yesterday made)
[05:07:50] <kokut> taplar:  <meta charset="utf-8">
[05:08:01] <`ULT> but the duration is not doing what i suspect it will do
[05:08:20] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/5/
[05:08:29] <taplar> kokut: yeah, if you got that, i'm out of ideas, X(
[05:09:53] <kokut> taplar: can i just encode it or something :\
[05:10:01] <kokut> this is annoying af
[05:11:34] <taplar> kokut: you might try encodeURI
[05:11:49] <taplar> it's not a URI string but it may encode the characters
[05:12:40] <kokut> taplar: its worse
[05:13:34] <kokut> okay, fixed it, decodeURI taplar :)))
[05:13:50] <kokut> ty
[05:13:52] <taplar> ah
[05:13:53] <taplar> heh
[05:14:46] <taplar> `ULT: looking at yours, being weird.  duration seems to be acting like a delay rather than a progression
[05:14:55] <`ULT> yes indeed
[05:15:23] <`ULT> thats not what i expected :p
[05:15:53] <`ULT> is it maybe also in the start: ?
[05:18:33] <ifohancroft> How can I make it so in .append(selectedOption); athe place of append there is a variable and the function that is the value of the variable is executed?
[05:18:46] <ifohancroft> for example if it's 'preppend' preppend will be executed
[05:19:11] <ifohancroft> I tried just replacing append with the name of the var but it didn't work.
[05:21:05] <taplar> ifohancroft: you might try looking at the api for the call() function
[05:21:17] <ifohancroft> Thank you, taplar.
[05:21:56] <ifohancroft> Btw actually what way is better, to have a variable that will contain a function name and call a function with name the variable of the value or just use if and depending on the value of the variable call a different function?
[05:22:01] <ifohancroft> which*
[05:23:10] <taplar> personally, i'd use the if
[05:23:16] <taplar> more readable imho
[05:23:39] <ifohancroft> Thank you.
[05:24:12] <taplar> `ULT: what element is it that your sliding?
[05:24:12] <b-ot> taplar: memorised “ULT: what element”.
[05:24:18] <taplar> huh?
[05:24:20] <ifohancroft> And for a case where you need to include something in a string depending on the value of a var, then just put the var in the string as in this case this is more readable?
[05:24:22] <taplar> bad bot!
[05:24:25] <ifohancroft> :D
[05:24:37] <`ULT> haha
[05:24:39] <`ULT> nice
[05:24:50] <`ULT> it is a table row
[05:25:02] <taplar> so a tr?
[05:25:04] <`ULT> yes
[05:25:33] <`ULT> table row with class more-info
[05:25:35] <taplar> i just found some documentation saying that the slideToggle animation will not work properly unless the element it is operating on has a width and height set on it
[05:25:56] <taplar> might try that
[05:26:01] <`ULT> hmm
[05:26:05] <`ULT> I will trie
[05:26:26] <`ULT> the height i can not set
[05:26:34] <`ULT> it`s variable.
[05:27:12] <`ULT> is it only with the slideToggle, maybe I can use slideUp and slideDown
[05:27:56] <mooncup> you can't
[05:28:15] <mooncup> slideToggle just calls either slideUp or slideDown depending on whether it is hidden or not
[05:28:34] <mooncup> bruncol is sending me spam via pm
[05:28:39] <`ULT> Yes I see, is also not working.
[05:29:02] <`ULT> and can I use animate maybe for it?
[05:29:31] <`ULT> so I need to give the tr a width and height?
[05:30:40] <taplar> mooncup: yep did me earlier, you might try letting #freenode know
[05:30:50] <taplar> or so i've been informed, :)
[05:31:29] <`ULT> taplar
[05:31:47] <`ULT> i tried a width and height in css. but now the toggle is acting realy weird.
[05:31:58] <taplar> same
[05:32:12] <taplar> for me it's snapping still, but then doing a little stretch animation, heh
[05:32:16] <`ULT> yes
[05:32:18] <`ULT> here also.
[05:33:00] <`ULT> i think it has to do with the :start
[05:38:38] <ifohancroft> So here is my double listbox, in case someone needs one: http://codepen.io/ifohancroft/pen/RPvwPb
[05:39:12] <ifohancroft> I don't see why everywhere on the web there are frameworks and stuff used to do this and uselessly complicating stuff when it can be this easy.
[05:40:05] <`ULT> what is it doing ifohancroft?
[05:47:35] <morphyeys> Hello guys,
[05:48:54] <taplar> `ULT: the more i mess around with it i think your running into an issue with the slideToggle conflicting with the table as it has a different display type that block or inline block
[05:50:10] <taplar> `ULT: you might try putting what you want to slide in a div inside the td, and try to slide that instead
[05:51:15] <ifohancroft> `ULT: Double ListBox. You select the options you want from a list of options and they go to the other box. Imagine you have a huge list of I don't know CPU's for example in an Intel webstore. You want to buy just 10 specific ones. Instead of just having them selected in a list of 10 000 you get them moved to another box so you easily see what you are about to purchase
[05:53:14] <`ULT> taplar: thank for thinking along.
[05:53:25] <`ULT> i will give it a try
[05:53:44] <`ULT> maybe the toggle is not supporting td`s.
[05:54:00] <`ULT> or not completely
[05:54:17] <taplar> trs by default appear to ignore css specifications to width height and overflow
[05:54:44] <taplar> which logically would be what the toggle would be incrementally affecting
[05:55:00] <`ULT> oke thank you ifohancroft
[05:55:07] <morphyeys> how to execute my <script></script> when the page is loaded and not before that, because I've included the jQuery file in the bottom of my page and when I write a script like <script> 	$( "#price" ).hide(); </script> it's saying ReferenceError: $ is not defined, because jQuery is not yet included ?
[05:55:18] <ifohancroft> You are welcome `ULT
[05:55:28] <taplar> you have to include jquery before using $
[05:55:47] <ifohancroft> morphyeys: put your code inside $(document).ready(function(){ your code here });
[05:56:00] <morphyeys> is that the way to do it
[05:56:05] <taplar> $ would still be undefined at that point.  jquery has to be included before that
[05:56:18] <morphyeys> taplar: it's the easier way to do it, but I need another way
[05:56:25] <morphyeys> why
[05:56:31] <taplar> lol, mind reader
[05:56:40] <morphyeys> okay why then people are saying that it's better to include .js files in the bottom?
[05:56:48] <taplar> some do, yes
[05:56:52] <morphyeys> so?
[05:56:59] <taplar> because of the order that the page loads
[05:57:04] <taplar> by that point your html has loaded
[05:57:25] <taplar> but if your using document ready or $() wrappings it's a mute point as it waits for the document to fully load
[05:57:36] <morphyeys> yes and $(document).ready(function(){ your code here }); is not going to work?
[05:57:45] <taplar> not before you include jquery
[05:57:54] <taplar> until you do that $ is just a character, not an operator
[05:57:57] <morphyeys> I am including jQuery in the bottom of the page
[05:58:02] <morphyeys> so I need to wait the html to laod
[05:58:04] <morphyeys> load
[05:58:12] <morphyeys> to have my jQuery included so my script will work?
[05:58:51] <taplar> bottom line, jquery must be included before you can use it's operator.
[05:59:00] <taplar> however you achieve that
[06:01:18] <prohobo> morphyeys: if you include jquery before your other scripts, it'll work
[06:01:36] <prohobo> scripts are sequentially loaded
[06:01:49] <prohobo> the entire webpage is sequentially loaded
[06:01:50] <`ULT> hi taplar, i put a div over the td: <div class="more-info" style="display: none;"><td>
[06:02:00] <`ULT> or do i need to put the div in the td?
[06:02:15] <taplar> i would think in, to keep your table layout
[06:02:48] <taplar> also makes more sense, it's content of the td
[06:02:57] <`ULT> oke yes.
[06:02:58] <`ULT> true
[06:05:28] <`ULT> taplar: you mean something like this?
[06:05:42] <`ULT> http://prntscr.com/80ponf
[06:06:16] <taplar> no, <tr><td><div>.....</div></td></tr>
[06:06:42] <morphyeys> I still can't get it tried with $(document).ready(function(){ your code here });
[06:06:44] <`ULT> hmm
[06:07:13] <taplar> morphyeys: got a fiddle?
[06:07:36] <`ULT> i dont think that will do the trick, so you think i need to put a div in al the cells?
[06:08:12] <taplar> just the one your sliding.  we're just trying to get it surrounded by an element that slideToggle should be able to work on
[06:08:33] <taplar> and let the row height rely on the contents height so it will auto adjust as it slides open and close
[06:08:59] <`ULT> oke, i will trie :p
[06:09:03] <`ULT> *try
[06:14:57] <ifohancroft> oh btw AdamPDotty, I've made it. Took around 14 rows of jQuery if you count formatting the code. I was right that it would be easier for me to write it on my own than install a framework or something and use it from there :D
[06:15:12] <ifohancroft> well one function and two calls of the function :D
[06:15:35] <taplar> jquery is a framework
[06:15:56] <ifohancroft> taplar: Isn't it considered a library, not a framework?
[06:16:26] <ifohancroft> But still, I mean I was earlier looking for a tutorial on double listbox and instead there were tutorials on how to install YII Framework for example and use it from there
[06:16:26] <taplar> can't say i know the technical difference.  probably heard it referred to as both
[06:16:59] <ifohancroft> so I meant it was easier to write it on your own than try to configure already premade one
[06:17:04] <taplar> :)
[06:17:48] <ifohancroft> I just found one bug I need to fix though :D
[06:18:04] <taplar> i saw a couple things that could use tweaking
[06:18:11] <ifohancroft> Oh, awesome. Hit me
[06:18:18] <taplar> 1) sorting
[06:18:38] <ifohancroft> As in being able to sort them in a specific way or?
[06:18:46] <taplar> auto sort for you as it moves them
[06:18:59] <taplar> instead of One being on the bottom, ex.
[06:19:26] <morphyeys> it's working with listener window.addEventListener("load", text); like this
[06:19:40] <ifohancroft> Yeah, sorting would be good.
[06:20:01] <ifohancroft> Btw if you don't mind I'd go have a cigarette and when I get back, I'll check your suggestions and fix/implement them
[06:20:05] <taplar> and 2) maybe add multi select
[06:20:33] <taplar> for example, on that demo page, for one of the selects, click the bottom white space
[06:20:39] <taplar> highlights the last one in blue
[06:20:45] <taplar> then shift click one of the previous ones
[06:20:53] <taplar> highlights them all, but only adds the clicked one
[06:24:47] <morphyeys> taplar: I have an anchor <a href="#" onclick="showPriceField(<?=$procedure['id'];?>)">- add price</a> and in my script I have a function
[06:24:53] <morphyeys> function showPriceField(id) { 		$( "#price" ).show(); 	}
[06:25:07] <morphyeys> but how to add the id to the #price
[06:25:13] <morphyeys> I've tried function showPriceField(id) { 		$( "#price" + id ).show(); 	}
[06:25:14] <morphyeys> didn't work
[06:26:53] <norc> Hi. I have a series of ajax calls, which need to refer to a variable outside their scope that may change during the ajax requests. Should I use .bind() to provide data to the ajax handler?
[06:30:21] <derstrom> morphyeys : check your developer tools in your browser for any errors (Ctrl + Shift + I, select "Console" and make sure the JavaScript tab is selected). perhaps #price ID doesn't exist.
[06:30:46] <morphyeys> it exists
[06:30:50] <morphyeys> and there are no errors
[06:31:26] <morphyeys> ahh it's working now
[06:31:35] <taplar> sorry, stepped away for food
[06:32:00] <hellyeah> hey
[06:32:01] <taplar> norc: copy the value into a variable that will not change
[06:32:15] <hellyeah> jquery 1.11.1  supports trigget method?
[06:32:23] <taplar> hellyeah: should
[06:32:30] <hellyeah> well
[06:32:35] <norc> taplar: http://pastie.org/10329514
[06:32:40] <taplar> check the api, will say which version it was added in
[06:32:46] <hellyeah> included  jquey 2.1.3
[06:32:54] <hellyeah> my script worked
[06:33:06] <hellyeah> but with 1.10.1 it didnt
[06:33:10] <hellyeah> letmme check
[06:33:24] <taplar> norc: inside the foo, make a local var, set it to the variable, and use the local var
[06:33:32] <norc> taplar: How you act like the jquery wizard while proving you do not understand asynchronous behavior is beyond me.
[06:34:08] <norc> taplar: http://pastie.org/10329521
[06:34:14] <norc> So just stop spreading this nonsense.
[06:34:55] <norc> Or understand how the langauge works.
[06:35:15] <taplar> norc this is a support chat room that anyone can participate and everyone are volunteers
[06:35:33] <taplar> questions are not meant to be asked to domain specialists only
[06:35:39] <norc> taplar: Then please refrain from participating in topics you clearly have no knowledge or experience.
[06:35:48] <norc> taplar: You make wrong claims about the language
[06:35:53] <taplar> asking questions and then replying with attitude is a good way to not get help
[06:36:10] <norc> And being quiet helps from giving bad advice.
[06:36:25] <tocka> hi guys
[06:38:04] <norc> morphyeys: Got a jsfiddle?
[06:38:06] <morphyeys> I have no idea how to use jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/mydnrrnL/2/
[06:38:12] <morphyeys> why it's not working on jsfiddle?
[06:38:20] <norc> Hilarious timing.
[06:38:34] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/yzgLpbpr/
[06:40:00] <taplar> ^ preserves it as it was
[06:40:42] <norc> taplar: Do you even test the code that you give?
[06:40:58] <taplar> it printed apple in the console
[06:41:53] <norc> morphyeys: Set on Load to no wrap in body, or use jqueries event binding
[06:42:17] <morphyeys> what?
[06:42:21] <morphyeys> I am a total newbie man
[06:42:37] <norc> taplar: Congratulations. You have just proven nothing.
[06:42:54] <norc> morphyeys: in jsfiddle, on the left side where you can select the jquery version for example
[06:43:01] <norc> under Framework & Extensions
[06:43:04] <taplar> lol, whatever.  at this point your just being disruptive
[06:43:04] <tocka> hi guys, quick question, i have a div that is 1200px on 550px and i need to fill it with other divs that are 150px on 50px, what would be the best way to do it? (The size of the main div might change if the browser window is resized)
[06:43:05] <tocka> :|
[06:43:07] <norc> Set it to no wrap in body
[06:43:29] <norc> taplar: You are being plain incompetent.
[06:43:41] <decx> *reading back*
[06:43:47] <hellyeah> my code work with 2.1.3
[06:45:11] <decx> looks to me like norc is needlessly confrontational
[06:46:18] <morphyeys> norc: yes I have selected it there's no version 2.0.14 but 2.0.13 seems legit too
[06:46:23] <norc> decx: Ive been here yesterday with the same problem. I just dont want him to respond to my questions.
[06:46:44] <decx> the way to do that is ignoring, your attitude is foolish
[06:47:15] <norc> morphyeys: The select below it where it says "onLoad", click on it and pick "no wrap - in body"
[06:47:48] <hellyeah> do you think i can use min version of normal version of jquery 2.1.3
[06:47:49] <morphyeys> norc: ahh okay http://jsfiddle.net/Siente/L0ksjmfe/1/
[06:48:09] <norc> morphyeys: There you go. I could have changed it for you, but you wouldnt have seen the difference. :=
[06:48:20] <morphyeys> norc: but now I want when add price is clicked and the div si showed to have another anchor hide price and to hide the input with that anchor onclick
[06:48:28] <`ULT> hello, can i consolo.log a variabele like console.log(namevariable); ?
[06:48:32] <morphyeys> what's the best way to do so
[06:48:33] <taplar> yes
[06:48:43] <decx> use data-* attributes and real events instead of onclick shenanigans
[06:48:52] <`ULT> thx
[06:48:54] <morphyeys> I can add id to the anchor and I can hide it when it's clicked?
[06:49:26] <norc> morphyeys: First start with using unobstrusive javascript.
[06:49:30] <decx> pushing these functions into the global scope doesnt help anybody
[06:49:37] <norc> That is a good way to do it right :)
[06:49:53] <norc> like decx said
[06:50:11] <`ULT> taplar, i trie to travers from the link to the showing div by $(this).parents("tr").next('tr').children('div');
[06:50:13] <`ULT> but not working :p
[06:50:16] <norc> decx: Feel like looking into my question though? I do have cookies.
[06:50:28] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/7/
[06:50:37] <notchris> $(‘#notchris’).append(breakfast);
[06:50:42] <notchris> Mmmmm
[06:50:43] <decx> i came late and know nothing about your problem
[06:50:53] <morphyeys> norc: what is unobstrusive ?
[06:50:56] <ffffionn> Hey guys, getting a "ReferenceError: $  is not defined"  looked up and tried all the common fixes, have jquery and jquery ui pulled in before my other js
[06:51:10] <notchris> ffffionn: Try document ready on your scripts
[06:51:25] <decx> look at your domtree
[06:52:02] <ffffionn> notchris: how do i go about this?  I am using docuent ready as part of one of my scripts
[06:52:19] <notchris> ffffionn: https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[06:52:30] <ffffionn> the $(document).ready is the first line where i get the error
[06:52:31] <morphyeys> ffffionn: you could also add a listener like this window.addEventListener("load", yourFunction);
[06:52:50] <morphyeys> not $(document).ready, but document.ready
[06:52:53] <notchris> Attention: bruncol is a scambot
[06:53:02] <taplar> `ULT: try using find() instead of children()
[06:53:38] <`ULT> great, thanks taplar, it begins to work.
[06:53:39] <ffffionn> I will try the event listener
[06:53:51] <hellyeah> what is this damn error "Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close'"
[06:53:51] <ffffionn> dont i need the $( )  to identify the DOM ?
[06:53:55] <`ULT> the correct animation is working on the div
[06:54:02] <taplar> :) sweet
[06:54:10] <`ULT> why is children not working?
[06:54:20] <decx> trs children are tds
[06:54:25] <taplar> ^
[06:54:34] <`ULT> aah oke
[06:54:39] <`ULT> div is a sibbling?
[06:54:43] <taplar> subchild
[06:54:45] <taplar> nested child
[06:54:45] <decx> div is a descendant
[06:55:18] <taplar> siblings have lateral relation
[06:55:23] <`ULT> oke, i think it important to learn all that terms
[06:55:36] <`ULT> thanks!
[07:00:03] <norc> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/mydnrrnL/11/ - This callback smells like a race condition because the value behind node might change before the callback is called. Is this assumption correct?
[07:00:20] <hellyeah> hey
[07:00:47] <hellyeah> i know code is kinda wrong but can youı take a look between 67-157 and tell me the wrong i did? http://jsfiddle.net/5tqfdLob/4/
[07:01:07] <taplar> brb, standup time
[07:01:28] <norc> hellyeah: Make a testcase!
[07:01:46] <decx> how's the val attribute changed?
[07:02:11] <norc> hellyeah: Reduce the code, describe what you want to accomplish, what the code does instead.
[07:02:31] <ifohancroft> Guys, how can I create a json array from the val() and html() of select options? I want the array to have element for each of the options in the select, and the key of each element to be the value of the option and each value of the key to be the .html() of an option
[07:02:40] <norc> decx: The val does not change, but node might by the time the callback is called.
[07:02:41] <hellyeah> okey
[07:03:06] <norc> hellyeah: Ideally something that fits into jsfiddle without scrolling. That way we can help you with your problem.
[07:03:07] <decx> first of all i wouldnt necessarily put ajax inside each
[07:03:24] <decx> but rather a recursive function that calls the next ajax on callback
[07:04:12] <norc> decx: That is not a good thing performance wise. I might have to do up to 6-7 callbacks, each may take up to 200ms to complete.
[07:04:26] <norc> s/may/does/
[07:05:57] <morphyeys> is it okay http://jsfiddle.net/Siente/m1kwoxcv/ ?
[07:07:07] <hellyeah> norc: little bit scrolling i want to use localStorage but button is triggered when you open the page and i see dialog window. And there is smt wrong in my code can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/5tqfdLob/7/ ?
[07:09:14] <taplar> back
[07:10:11] <hellyeah> i fund why it happened
[07:10:14] <hellyeah> so weird
[07:13:02] <hellyeah> i took an error after clicking second time http://jsfiddle.net/5tqfdLob/10/ error: Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'close' jquery.min.js 2
[07:13:27] <hellyeah> pls guide me
[07:14:27] <taplar> clicking what the second time?
[07:15:36] <hellyeah> click red button you will get modal window close it
[07:15:42] <hellyeah> and click it again
[07:15:46] <hellyeah> it will diseppear
[07:16:53] <taplar> your not showing your button anymore in the close
[07:16:55] <taplar> it's commented out
[07:17:45] <hellyeah> there is line such button.hide()
[07:17:52] <hellyeah> it will hide button default?
[07:18:03] <taplar> that will hide the element, yes
[07:18:37] <hellyeah> same problem here http://jsfiddle.net/5tqfdLob/12/
[07:21:44] <prohobo> bruncol: did you pm me?
[07:21:50] <prohobo> !seen bruncol
[07:21:51] <b-ot> prohobo: I saw bruncol 1h 57m ago, saying something to me in private.
[07:21:55] <prohobo> okay
[07:22:14] <prohobo> bruncol is spamming some kind of link in pms
[07:22:31] <taplar> hellyeah: your hiding your overlay now
[07:22:35] <taplar> button belongs to overlay
[07:23:54] <prohobo> hellyeah, you got a lot of work to do with the CSS
[07:24:32] <hellyeah> prohobo: i am aware
[07:27:38] <`ULT> hellyeah, what are you making? :p
[07:29:37] <hellyeah> try to use localstorage
[07:30:46] <`ULT> oke, that looks complex!

[07:35:20] <taplar> your master!
[07:38:03] <hellyeah> man
[07:38:06] <Dr-007> I'm getting this error: TypeError: jQuery.easing[this.easing] is not a function. Google tells me that it is because the easing function names have changed. so i downgraded my jquery version from **.10 to **.9
[07:38:08] <hellyeah> it worked on jsfiddle
[07:38:13] <hellyeah> i didnt work on my local
[07:38:22] <hellyeah> this fucking crazy
[07:38:29] <hellyeah> DAMN !!!
[07:38:31] <taplar> language please
[07:38:45] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:39:22] <hellyeah> same thing exactly same thing didnt work on my local
[07:39:27] <hellyeah> hell
[07:39:57] <taplar> Dr-007: you trying to use the jqueryui function?
[07:41:28] <Herehere0> guys I have in my function
[07:41:29] <Herehere0> e.preventDefault();
[07:41:30] <hellyeah> it doesnt work on my computer
[07:41:34] <Herehere0> which prevent form from submit
[07:41:35] <hellyeah> how is this possible?
[07:41:52] <Herehere0> How can I reenable form for submitting?
[07:42:08] <taplar> Herehere0: you'll have to resubmit it
[07:42:24] <Herehere0> taplar: I have something like this                     $('.task_edit_form').submit();
[07:42:37] <Herehere0> it works but what If I have multople submit buttons?
[07:42:58] <taplar> do you have special handlers on the submit buttons?
[07:43:56] <Herehere0> taplar: Im using bootbox plugin
[07:43:57] <Herehere0> https://dpaste.de/yZsD
[07:44:14] <Herehere0> first I disable 'delete-button'
[07:44:34] <Herehere0> then how can I submit again form but with this specific button?
[07:44:50] <taplar> oh, you'd have to enable it again
[07:45:08] <Herehere0> taplar: Yes, so how can I do that :P
[07:45:23] <taplar> $(element).prop('disabled', false);
[07:45:31] <Herehere0> so if I enable it again then just do something like this? $('.delete-button').click()
[07:45:37] <taplar> yup
[07:47:10] <Herehere0> taplar: it seems doesnt work. Am I doing it right? https://dpaste.de/jphh
[07:47:57] <taplar> k, your always preventing your default
[07:48:06] <taplar> so your going to have to have some sort of conditional not to do that
[07:48:30] <Herehere0> thanks good to know
[07:49:00] <taplar> you could set a prop('confirmed', true) on your button for instance
[07:49:06] <Dr-007> taplar, me myself: no. i'm using the plugin "tagit" that tries to use it when deleting a tag
[07:49:33] <Dr-007> this seemed hopefull: http://www.gilluminate.com/2011/06/06/jquery-easingjquery-easing-def-is-not-a-function/ but did not work
[07:49:39] <taplar> Dr-007: ah, got no clue there, :(
[07:50:14] <taplar> Herehere0: oh, or actually, what you could do on confirmation is remove that handler
[07:51:04] <taplar> then no need for the extra check
[07:58:57] <ifohancroft> Guys, I can get the values of selected options and push them to array using arrayName.push($(this).val()) but what I want to do is get the value to be the key and the inner html to be the value of the key
[07:59:00] <ifohancroft> how can I do that?
[07:59:24] <taplar> you'd want to push and object/map to your list
[07:59:44] <taplar> or if all the keys are unique, it could just be a single object
[08:00:47] <ifohancroft> How to do that?
[08:01:21] <taplar> var newObj = {};  newObj[$(this).val()] = $(this).text(); //do something with it
[08:01:44] <ifohancroft> Ah, yes. Thank you. Let me try it.
[08:04:30] <`ULT> hello, in fiddle there are two very usefull functions: TidyUp and JSHint
[08:05:12] <`ULT> are this function also available in an edittor like dreamweaver?
[08:05:49] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2146862/is-it-possible-to-auto-format-your-code-in-dreamweaver
[08:08:06] <`ULT> thank you!
[08:09:03] <`ULT> but the mentioned functions are disabled: http://prntscr.com/80r4fc
[08:10:49] <`ULT> witch code editer do you guys recommend?
[08:12:12] <akkufomk> I like netbeans
[08:21:40] <ifohancroft> I am totally confused. Maybe I am doing it the wrong way. How do I get the value and html of all the options in select, on the click of a button, sort them by the html alphabetically and put them back in?
[08:22:01] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to sort options in a select?
[08:22:12] <ifohancroft> yes
[08:22:48] <robertmaxrees> could $.map() out the .val() and .text() of each option, then sort the resulting array and re-build the select/.
[08:22:50] <ifohancroft> I made a double listbox and I am adding options from one select to another and I want when I add/add more options to the second select, to sort them all
[08:23:18] <tocka> hi guys, quick question, i have a div that is 1200px on 550px and i need to fill it with other divs that are 150px on 50px, what would be the best way to do it? (The size of the main div might change if the browser window is resized)
[08:23:31] <ifohancroft> well I tried doing something like this (not using $.map() though) and it turns out arrays don't have keys, and objects can't be sorted so I am confused :D
[08:23:49] <robertmaxrees> ifohancroft make a fiddle.
[08:23:58] <robertmaxrees> because you want to sort the array using the text of the select.
[08:24:29] <robertmaxrees> the array's indexes would be objects that would be something like {text: value}
[08:24:45] <ifohancroft> Yes, I just just sort of achieved that I think
[08:24:54] <ifohancroft> creating an array who's elements are objects
[08:25:01] <robertmaxrees> ifohancroft right.
[08:25:34] <ifohancroft> Here it is how it looks like, not sure if it's supposed to be in "" like it's a string:
[08:25:35] <ifohancroft> ["{key: 1, value: 1},", "{key: 2, value: 2},", "{key: 5, value: 5},", "{key: 4, value: 4},"]
[08:25:48] <robertmaxrees> ifohancroft nope, not strings
[08:25:51] <robertmaxrees> no "" on that.\
[08:26:10] <ifohancroft> This is how I am pushing the elements: selectedOptions.push('{key: ' + $(this).val() + ', value: ' + $(this).val() + '},');
[08:26:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to do that.
[08:26:28] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle - i'll show you what to do.
[08:29:03] <ifohancroft> ok, give me some time
[08:29:21] <robertmaxrees> should just need the two select boxes :)
[08:29:53] <ifohancroft> well I have already putted it in a codepen, does it have to be a fiddle?
[08:30:00] <robertmaxrees> codepen is fine.
[08:30:04] <ifohancroft> awesome
[08:30:13] <ifohancroft> http://codepen.io/ifohancroft/pen/RPvwPb
[08:30:47] <robertmaxrees> what browser support are you planning to have?
[08:31:45] <robertmaxrees> and where is the code you mentioned earlier?
[08:31:51] <ifohancroft> well usually I am trying to possibly make my stuff work on all browsers also possibly without browser specific hacks
[08:31:59] <ifohancroft> the code I mentioned earlier is being tested on local
[08:32:08] <robertmaxrees> okay - function moveSelected(option, moveTo, selected = '') { - is only available in ES6.
[08:32:09] <ifohancroft> well I won't be supporting IE at all that's for sure :D
[08:32:15] <robertmaxrees> that's too bad.
[08:32:24] <robertmaxrees> this would support IE if you didn't use a default param.
[08:32:49] <ifohancroft> well ok I can just remove the default parameter but the UI I am doing will be only used in our office and no one here uses IE
[08:34:36] <robertmaxrees> so first off, your "moveSelected" function is overcomplicating things :)
[08:35:03] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/odp777zj/
[08:37:18] <robertmaxrees> so converted over, you can just do this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/odp777zj/1/
[08:41:23] <ifohancroft> I am not sure how this works :D Btw also is it me or the sorting is not in there atm?
[08:41:30] <robertmaxrees> it's not/.
[08:41:36] <robertmaxrees> i'll help you get that part working.
[08:41:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to delete/rebuild anything when moving elements around.
[08:41:53] <robertmaxrees> you can just move them.
[08:42:10] <robertmaxrees> .append() and .appendTo() "move" the element - it gets deleted from its original location.
[08:42:27] <ifohancroft> oh, awesome, I didn't knew that.
[08:42:43] <ifohancroft> btw give me few minutes to fix something else first and I will get back here to this (I won't be leaving the channel etc)
[08:42:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:42:55] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[08:43:02] <ifohancroft> well sry but tell this to my boss :D
[08:50:37] <czio> greetings, i have a div container with 3 blocks of div elements inside, how can i add a click event listener that triggers when the user is clicking inside the container but on unused areas lets call it the white space of the container?
[08:50:59] <robertmaxrees> czio huh?
[08:51:25] <robertmaxrees> you could use an event listener on the parent container.
[08:52:21] <czio> robertmaxrees, http://pastebin.ca/3088513
[08:52:34] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question lol
[08:52:48] <czio> i do
[08:53:02] <czio> use an event listener on the parent container
[08:53:20] <robertmaxrees> you can bind a listener to just the parent container and not pass the second arg to .on() - that'll capture every event inside that element.
[08:53:41] <s2013> hi if i have bunch of <li> and i want to set a class to some of them how would i do that? like lets say i want to set the first 5 of them to the class active
[08:54:05] <robertmaxrees> s2013 you could use a .each() and check the index.
[08:54:36] <czio> robertmaxrees, you mean to stop propagation ?
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> czio this is why i asked for clarification - i don't understand what you're trying to do.
[08:55:07] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you want one event listener that handles all clicks inside a parent container.
[08:55:18] <robertmaxrees> but you want to handle ones inside certain elements differently.
[08:56:08] <s2013> hmm ok
[08:57:43] <czio> robertmaxrees, can i share a photo to help me make you understand?
[08:57:51] <robertmaxrees> czio make a fiddle.
[08:57:55] <robertmaxrees> that'll really help.
[08:58:00] <robertmaxrees> pictures rarely get the point accross.
[08:58:17] <czio> robertmaxrees, ok you are right
[09:03:33] <fission6> how can i keep making an ajax call until i get a certain result in the response? i want to paginate through until i get no more items returned
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> recursive calls.
[09:06:13] <robertmaxrees> fission6 http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/qx9nmkrp/
[09:07:40] <fission6> robertmaxrees: thanks let me explore, will report back, could i hit a depth issue with the recursion (i dont really expect more than 10 calls)
[09:07:55] <robertmaxrees> fission6 "depth issue"?
[09:18:17] <czio> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/Lv1n9ur3/6/
[09:18:41] <czio> robertmaxrees, i want to get triggered when not clicking the colored boxes
[09:18:43] <robertmaxrees> console error.
[09:18:47] <czio> yes
[09:19:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out what to use instead of "?"
[09:19:44] <czio> yes
[09:19:58] <czio> https://jsfiddle.net/Lv1n9ur3/8/
[09:20:23] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:21:01] <robertmaxrees> btw focus is a bad name - that's a global object.
[09:21:41] <czio> oops
[09:21:44] <czio> i forgot it
[09:22:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lv1n9ur3/9/
[09:22:12] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[09:22:40] <czio> ha
[09:22:46] <czio> thanks
[09:22:56] <czio> it was so obvious
[09:23:09] <czio> except me :)
[09:23:11] <czio> for*
[10:10:14] <k-joseph> hi guys, so many jquery libraries are invoked using something like; $("#elementId").libraryInvokingFunc(); how can i unbind libraryInvokingFunc() function from $("#elementId") element so that to re-create it dynamically?
[10:11:49] <robertmaxrees> k-joseph you don't.
[10:11:54] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to accomplish?
[10:13:19] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: the particular library am dealing with allows me to set it's data dynamically, so i want to re-instanciate it on the same element
[10:13:45] <robertmaxrees> you'll very likely need to destroy it and re-create it - each plugin handles thins differently.
[10:14:33] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: does jQuery allows me the option to destroy the function on an html element? that's what i want to do since this library doesn't do that
[10:14:51] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[10:16:11] <k-joseph> robertmaxrees: how about setting element to the default state as when loaded the page
[10:16:29] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't exist.
[10:33:51] <lindii_> how can i grab a particular textarea depending its id like here https://jsfiddle.net/qv693v4k/1/
[10:35:27] <taplar> you can match on a partial
[10:35:48] <taplar> '[field^="string"]' will match fields that start with a given string
[10:35:58] <taplar> '[field$="string"]' will match fields that end with a given string
[10:36:40] <lindii_> im kinda beginner. dont know how to do that
[10:37:07] <taplar> so your doing "#comment_box.." and it looks like your textareas start with that prefix
[10:37:22] <taplar> so that would be a starts with conditional on id
[10:37:38] <taplar> '[id^="comment_box"]'
[10:37:48] <lindii_> taplar: and to grab the rest?
[10:38:07] <taplar> 'rest'?
[10:39:11] <lindii_> taplar: i mean i can have comment_box_micropost_10 and also comment_box_image_15 for example
[10:39:22] <taplar> right
[10:39:38] <taplar> that matcher would find both of them
[10:39:44] <robertmaxrees> use a class btw.
[10:39:47] <robertmaxrees> don't select on partial IDs.
[10:40:10] <taplar> good idea too
[10:40:31] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: what are ids for then
[10:40:40] <robertmaxrees> having a singular element.
[10:40:45] <robertmaxrees> #nav_logo
[10:41:02] <taplar> #header, #body, :D
[10:41:08] <robertmaxrees> if you had a single comment box, an ID would make sense.  you don't, so a class would make much more sense.
[10:41:40] <lindii_> or maybe data attibutes?
[10:41:48] <robertmaxrees> that's even worse.
[10:41:53] <robertmaxrees> data attributes aren't for selecting.
[10:41:56] <robertmaxrees> they're for storing data.
[10:42:03] <lindii_> ohh ok
[10:57:09] <lindii_> taplar: it looks better like this? https://jsfiddle.net/qv693v4k/2/
[10:57:22] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:57:36] <robertmaxrees> why are you giving them unique classes?
[10:57:41] <taplar> the point of using a class is they should all be the same
[10:57:45] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:57:49] <taplar> it's a grouping mechanism
[10:58:22] <taplar> keep your unique ids if you need them, but for selecting them all, use the common class
[10:58:23] <lindii_> then i missunderstood your point i guess
[10:58:57] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ why do you need the number in the classname?
[10:59:41] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: i thought i should be using them for selecting a particular item
[10:59:53] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ why do they need to be unique?
[11:00:37] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: wouldnt be selecting all if i dont make them unique?
[11:00:46] <robertmaxrees> why do they need to be unique at all?
[11:01:44] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: because i want to submit the form for a particular post when hitting enter
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> then use $(this).closest('form');
[11:02:37] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: you mean in line 11?
[11:02:44] <robertmaxrees> si.
[11:02:47] <lindii_> gracias
[11:05:56] <_biff> could anybody answer using sessions why not good enough to prevent hacking forms..
[11:06:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:06:25] <robertmaxrees> (context for a question like that is a good idea)
[11:06:36] <_biff> ah:)
[11:06:38] <_biff> sorry
[11:07:09] <taplar> could anybody answer (why) using sessions (is) not good enough to prevent hacking forums... ?
[11:07:20] <taplar> forms
[11:07:21] <robertmaxrees> define "hacking"
[11:07:30] <robertmaxrees> because that's... ephemeral.  most people misapply the concept.
[11:07:38] <_biff> yyes but this is not that room:)
[11:07:43] <robertmaxrees> and the problem here isn't totally apparent as a result.
[11:10:04] <xnil> Say I want to do something like `$("<div id='foo'").text("bar");` to create a div#foo with content "bar". How can I do this? Is the aforementioned code correct?
[11:10:29] <robertmaxrees> $('<div id="foo">').text('bar');
[11:10:52] <robertmaxrees> you were missing a closing >
[11:10:59] <xnil> oops, yeah
[11:11:02] <xnil> so that does work?
[11:11:05] <xnil> neat.

[14:22:03] <datahumanity> i was trying to write a script that said ...  if there is a console error message, then console.log a message that says "there was an error"
[14:22:09] <datahumanity> anyone have an idea how to accomplish this?
[14:22:15] <duch_kazatel> a try catch.
[14:22:35] <datahumanity> but, even with try catch... you still have to detet if there is a console.error or not an error
[14:22:37] <robertmaxrees> try { /* code that will error */ } catch (e) { console.log('there was an error') }
[14:22:55] <datahumanity> but, its easy to detect if there is a console object... but hard to know if console.error message occured (for me at least)
[14:22:56] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify your problem?
[14:23:07] <datahumanity> hey! robert :) you helped me a lot in the past
[14:23:19] <robertmaxrees> you have to wrap your code in a try/catch - like, that's the tool you have.
[14:23:41] <datahumanity> yea... so lets say I had 10 iframes on the page, and 1/10 had an an error... it all shows up in the same console and it's hard for me to know which 1/10 had the error
[14:24:01] <datahumanity> so i thought maybe, i could log the title of the iframe if an error occured
[14:24:16] <datahumanity> but, i couldnt figure out how to detect if a console.error message occured
[14:24:26] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to wrap the code that could error in a try/catch - you can't detect that otherwise.
[14:25:00] <datahumanity> i understand because if there is an error in the try section... the catch section would execute and could display the page title
[14:25:05] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:25:13] <datahumanity> gosh, but wrapping a 10 iframes in a try / catch... wouldnt be that performant
[14:25:21] <robertmaxrees> try/catch isn't performance.
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> *performant
[14:25:31] <datahumanity> that's also the only way i can think of to accomplish the goal though... hmm
[14:25:35] <robertmaxrees> and it's the code inside the iframe you'd wrap.
[14:25:43] <robertmaxrees> so why do you have code throwing an error?
[14:25:47] <xnil> try/catch === performance => fals
[14:25:47] <xnil> e
[14:25:53] <datahumanity> cause its like user generated code... so maybe they make a mistake
[14:26:01] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:26:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you have users entering code?
[14:26:20] <xnil> this whole design sounds a little wonky to me
[14:26:27] <datahumanity> kind of like, how jsfiddle enters code
[14:26:50] <datahumanity> or  cssdeck, codepen, etc.
[14:27:08] <robertmaxrees> bruncol
[14:27:10] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[14:27:10] <xnil> datahumanity: are you having users enter code? is that what the site is? what else might the iframes contain
[14:27:28] <datahumanity> yea, just code the users enter to build widgets
[14:27:37] <xnil> datahumanity: why are you using iframes?
[14:27:39] <robertmaxrees> "to build widgets"?
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> something here sounds really strange.
[14:27:51] <datahumanity> cause it seperates the widget from the rest of the site and the other widgets
[14:28:00] <xnil> robertmaxrees++
[14:28:04] <robertmaxrees> and that's fine - why are you protecting users from themselves
[14:28:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:28:15] <robertmaxrees> why are there 10 iframes?
[14:28:32] <xnil> robertmaxrees: i'm thinking he might be doing something like codepen's display
[14:28:44] <xnil> where they have multiple codepen thingies on one page showing previews
[14:28:45] <robertmaxrees> except that's one iframe.  he said he has 10.
[14:28:52] <xnil> yes, they have maaany of them
[14:28:58] <xnil> at once
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> they have a single iframe dispaying the code that would toss an error i thought.
[14:29:16] <datahumanity> for each preview it is a unique iframe
[14:29:20] <xnil> yes
[14:29:39] <datahumanity> but iframes aside... i think you're right, there is no way to detect if there is a js error message short of a try catch block
[14:29:40] <robertmaxrees> there's a single preview pane though.
[14:29:47] <datahumanity> which i cant do for performance reasons, so it's a null idea anyway
[14:29:57] <datahumanity> for the editor, yes, single preview pane
[14:30:11] <datahumanity> for the gallery, there might be 6 or 9 i think, depending upon how many previews there are
[14:30:24] <robertmaxrees> "gallery"?
[14:30:39] <datahumanity> yeah, like image gallery, but for iframes
[14:30:49] <xnil> robertmaxrees: codepen.org
[14:30:55] <xnil> oops
[14:31:00] <xnil> http://codepen.com
[14:31:03] <robertmaxrees> xnil i'm familiar with the site.  i thought he was talking about the preview pane.
[14:31:08] <datahumanity> :)
[14:31:08] <xnil> no sorry wrong again
[14:31:13] <xnil> ah
[14:31:28] <robertmaxrees> but it's a "gallery" - if one's broken, that's the problem of the person who made it.
[14:31:46] <datahumanity> yes but, regardless of who is at fault... i want to make it easy for them to fix
[14:31:58] <datahumanity> because many users can share and it might not just be the user who created the error
[14:32:00] <robertmaxrees> why is it a gallery?
[14:32:11] <datahumanity> maybe im using wrong word i think
[14:32:22] <robertmaxrees> :) what are you building?
[14:33:30] <datahumanity> its just another online code editor
[14:33:40] <robertmaxrees> what's the gallery thing then?
[14:33:49] <robertmaxrees> like, a place where people can see a bunch of different projects?
[14:33:54] <datahumanity> yea
[14:34:00] <robertmaxrees> then don't worry about it.
[14:34:18] <robertmaxrees> if somebody submitted code and knows that it'll be displayed somewhere, it's on them to make sure it doesn't break before it gets there.
[14:38:48] <datahumanity> :)
[14:42:10] <datahumanity> Does anyone have a reccomentation for good cheap unmanaged linux hosting?
[14:42:21] <robertmaxrees> #web would be a great resource for that.
[14:42:24] <datahumanity> yes
[14:42:29] <datahumanity> i will ask there thanks robert
[14:44:39] <krambiorix> hi, what are the best jquery plugins for viewing pdf's (in a div) ?
[14:45:25] <datahumanity> pdfs are hard, ive yet to find one that is responsive to 100% width of parent div.  If you happen to find one krambiorix, please share.
[14:46:03] <robertmaxrees> check out https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js
[14:46:44] <robertmaxrees> embedding pdfs in pages is a funky proposition.
[15:01:27] <datahumanity> krambiorix - http://datanity.com/pdf
[15:02:06] <datahumanity> does that work for pdf embed?
[15:02:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd go with the mozilla solution but whatevs.
[15:03:26] <datahumanity> yes, this has no js.  It's just vanilla objectdata HTML element
[15:03:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah - anybody who doesn't have acrobat or another pdf viewer installed won't be able to see that.
[15:04:21] <datahumanity> true
[15:04:35] <datahumanity> there is a neat service ive used in the past that converts pdf to html... could use that and upload html/css/js it generates
[15:04:47] <robertmaxrees> the mozilla viewer does that on the fly :)
[15:04:47] <datahumanity> i dont know mozilla solution but, ims ure it's good
[15:05:33] <datahumanity> :)
[15:05:35] <krambiorix> datahumanity, yeah i know of that but you can't use the result as responsive html code
[15:08:34] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, can i use the mozilla solution to put the pdf in a div?
[15:09:01] <robertmaxrees> krambiorix should be able to use it to embed things, yeah.
[15:09:22] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, where can i read more about this?
[15:09:41] <robertmaxrees> well i mean https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js#questions
[15:12:01] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, ow i thought it was a firefox plugin
[15:12:15] <robertmaxrees> should be able to embed with it.  could be wrong.
[15:12:34] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, pitty it doesn't come with chrome and IE :s
[15:38:41] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, and what about iframes?
[15:40:07] <robertmaxrees> what about them?
[15:44:56] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, would it be a good idea to use them to show a pdf file ?
[15:46:43] <NeedSomeHelp> Hello, I am creating a fixed top responsive navbar. I have a little problem with it. I cant seem to avoid the burgermenu to crash and overlap with the search function when making the window smaller/narrower. Anyone have time to assist me a little? http://www.cirithungol.org/?work=1
[15:50:10] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, NeedSomeHelp
[15:52:01] <NeedSomeHelp> robertmaxrees: I tried, but I just couldnt make the fiddle the exact same behaviour as the live version
[16:56:25] <macscam1> can anyone help me with a basic question about scope + ajax https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c66f9a3df3ed89dec1d1
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> you just access it.
[16:56:39] <robertmaxrees> it's there.
[17:01:30] <macscam1> robertmaxrees: it is not... see more info https://gist.github.com/MaxPleaner/dbadc57bb4e64aef6986
[17:01:51] <macscam1> robertmaxrees: i realized i use the variable with a callback function though
[17:01:58] <macscam1> can use*
[17:04:18] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense there.
[17:08:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah, $el should be defined there
[17:11:53] <macscam1> robertmaxrees: it's not, did you see the other files i added https://gist.github.com/MaxPleaner/dbadc57bb4e64aef6986
[17:12:34] <robertmaxrees> then you have another problem.
[17:12:40] <robertmaxrees> because $el is defined there.
[17:12:44] <robertmaxrees> closure.
[17:13:10] <macscam1> how do i solve that?
[17:13:43] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to solve.  $el exists in an outer scope.
[17:13:48] <robertmaxrees> so it exists in all child schopes.
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> *scopes.
[17:13:56] <robertmaxrees> so your issue doesn't make sense.
[17:15:54] <robertmaxrees> your initialize looks funky - what's the story there?
[17:16:26] <robertmaxrees> you could just do $('form, .ajax-form').submit(function() {}); instead
[17:20:18] <macscam1> robertmaxrees: yeah your right that is redundant thanks
[17:21:02] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that .bind() is causing some of your headaches.  i doubt it, but maybe?
[17:31:25] <blinky_> Anyone here have any experience with google maps, can you tell me what I am doing wrong here, trying to get two maps, one with a single pin and one with a route/track - http://pastie.org/10330356
[17:53:42] <davidpardy> If you notice with all jquery ui datepicker themes, when you click a previous/next month, it’ll change the height of the calendar div, therefore changing the height of content below the date picker. Is there a way to avoid this? So the content will not move below the datepicker when a month is changed?
[18:31:00] <SimbaLion> Hi, I want to create a glossy screen effect like a mobile phone, I tried to do it with CSS but the only technique I found is only suitable for single elements like images, links underneath the effect couldn't be clicked on. So I'm looking for a jquery solution, can anyone recommend one?
[19:36:16] <walabe> could anyone make an educated guess why a jquery script would not work correctly when ONLINE, i.e. uploaded to a host, but works perfect offline?
[19:36:56] <yessopie> CORS?
[19:38:22] <yessopie> incorrect mime types or charset http headers given by the remote server?
[19:38:54] <walabe> actually it seems like it's not loading the css file or something
[19:39:03] <yessopie> did you open the developer console of your browser to see what the error is?
[19:39:18] <walabe> there is no error
[19:39:24] <yessopie> it will tell you about any javascript errors and if you go to the network tab, you can see everything it tries to download
[19:39:32] <walabe> yeah so it works, but it seems the css is stuffed
[19:39:33] <yessopie> you will see if css fails to d/l
[19:39:51] <walabe> oh okay
[19:40:13] <yessopie> maybe not all files are identical
[19:40:24] <yessopie> maybe your browser is looking at an old version of the file (use ctrl-f5 to refresh without cache)
[19:40:26] <walabe> strange everything loaded fine
[19:42:45] <walabe> i can't see my img file in the dev tools
[19:42:49] <walabe> img folder
[19:45:55] <walabe> maybe someone could help, here's my site http://chronox.comxa.com/ scroll down right above the end form, that section with the "gallery" is screwing up
[19:46:12] <walabe> it's like the position and size of them is all out of wack
[19:46:53] <yessopie> when I clicked on it it wanted to bring me to a site that, according to Chrome, had "harmful programs"
[19:47:11] <walabe> i'm using free hosting
[19:48:01] <yessopie> I see an error in the console:  Uncaught TypeError: $(...).interactive_bg is not a function
[19:48:14] <yessopie> in chrome
[19:48:27] <walabe> yeah that's a different plugin
[19:49:08] <walabe> can it read numbers
[19:49:18] <yessopie> so your free hosting is doing something to the page to show these ads
[19:49:33] <walabe> like would ""assets/img/gallery/6.jpg" be an issue
[19:50:18] <yessopie> whatever your hosting is doing is probably messing up the page somehow
[19:50:27] <walabe> oh
[19:55:12] <walabe> are you sure, it just seems there's some issue here i just gotta find it
[19:57:49] <walabe> its suppose to look like this http://i.imgur.com/j4Z3TqS.png
[20:01:32] <walabe> the js isn't working properly, it's not inserting "transform" styles like it usually does
[22:44:00] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:55:05] <dopie> hey all i have a question i wrapped 	var country = $("select#ems_organization_country").val();
[22:55:11] <dopie> inside a document.ready
[22:55:32] <dopie> and a console.log to see what it logs but it doesn't log anything when i select the dropdown
[22:55:37] <dopie> the dropdown value
[22:55:41] <dopie> what am i doing wrong?
[23:02:02] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/vzbtv4mz/
[23:02:09] <dopie> how come this isn't logging anything?
[23:02:52] <nodist> let me see
[23:03:38] <nodist> dopie -> http://jsfiddle.net/vzbtv4mz/1/
[23:03:55] <nodist> also in jsfiddle you need to set your fiddle to use jQuery
[23:05:25] <dopie> nodist, just tried it locally :(
[23:05:26] <dopie> didn't work
[23:05:33] <nodist> my fiddle?
[23:06:20] <dopie> yeah
[23:06:41] <nodist> the fiddle doesn't work for you?
[23:06:42] <dopie> basically i want the value of the dropdown to be put in console.lo
[23:06:44] <dopie> no
[23:06:53] <dopie> it doesn't give me an error so thats good
[23:07:00] <dopie> but nothing happens
[23:07:01] <nodist> for me im getting ATA hey etc
[23:07:06] <nodist> in the console
[23:07:14] <Uhkis> worked fine here too
[23:07:22] <nodist> what browser are you using?
[23:07:34] <dopie> it works too
[23:07:38] <dopie> I'm saying on my setup locally
[23:07:42] <dopie> yeah thanks
[23:07:43] <dopie> :)
[23:07:56] <Uhkis> well did you include jquery on your local setup?
[23:08:07] <walabe> ya know scrollTo plugin? does this have any issues on ipad known?
[23:11:37] <walabe> dw
[23:53:47] <norc> Is identifying nodes which carry data in their attributes by a data attribute a bad habit? $("div[data-customer-id='1234']")
[23:55:42] <norc> I mean these nodes are unique, so they could also be identified by an ID, but I find using formatted strings there an even worse idea.
