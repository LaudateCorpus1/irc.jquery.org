[00:03:10] <ryanaz> I wrote a function that wraps the ajax call for me, how do I get it to return the json ?
[00:03:11] <ryanaz> function get_data(action) { $.ajax({ url: "/api/get.cgi", cache: false, dataType: "json", type: "POST", data: { action: action }, context: document.body }).success(function(json) { if (json.status == "success") { return json; } else { alert("An error occurred, try again later."); } }); }
[00:03:39] <ryanaz> ie:    var json = get_data('action');
[00:03:58] <hooloovoo> it doesn't
[00:04:04] <ryanaz> yah I know.. ;)
[00:04:14] <ryanaz> how do I get it to do that?
[00:04:18] <hooloovoo> well
[00:04:20] <hooloovoo>  you don't
[00:04:20] <ryanaz> or am I just doing it backwards?
[00:04:24] <hooloovoo> ya
[00:04:32] <hooloovoo> this is async stuff, so no returning data
[00:04:41] <hooloovoo> you gotta do stuff in the callback
[00:06:05] <ryanaz> so like:   get_data('action').other_function(json).other_fuction2(json); ?
[00:06:20] <hooloovoo> no
[00:07:00] <hooloovoo> in the .success(function() { //Do stuff with your data here, don't return. });
[00:07:31] <systemfault> ryanaz: With async, you have to "rethink" the way your program executes.
[00:07:41] <pwmckenna> hi all
[00:08:20] <hooloovoo> ryanaz: ya. the reason you can't return is because things don't happen in order so there's no way of knowing your data is actually stored yet when you wanna use it later
[00:08:55] <pwmckenna> Does anyone know what the expected behavior is if you specify clone on a draggable, and the original dom element is removed while still draggin?
[00:08:58] <hooloovoo> hi pwmckenna
[00:09:16] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: shouldn't matter
[00:09:32] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: the clone is a new element
[00:09:53] <ryanaz> systemfault:  ok ...  so how would I do this?    get_data('action', successfullCallback, failureCallback); ?
[00:10:12] <hooloovoo> ryanaz: that's one way of doing it.
[00:10:13] <systemfault> ryanaz: That would be a way, yes
[00:10:25] <ryanaz> what's another way?
[00:10:37] <rabbi1> var checkValid = $("form").validate().element("#username"); this is perfect for single field, what should i do, if i have check for n number of fields to a single variable ?
[00:10:45] <systemfault> ryanaz: Return what the $.ajax call returns...
[00:11:15] <systemfault> ryanaz: So you can do: get_data('action').done(function(data) {}).fail(function(){});
[00:11:22] <ryanaz> systemfault:  what's that?  an object?
[00:11:30] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: it becomes unmovable/undroppable when the original is removed...so its just stuck on the page
[00:11:33] <systemfault> ryanaz: Yeah
[00:11:58] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: that's weird. try attaching the clone to $("body")
[00:12:16] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: that's what I had originally
[00:12:17] <Blaster> hey guys
[00:12:22] <hooloovoo> or create a custom helper
[00:12:29] <systemfault> ryanaz: You should think about switching to camelCase :P
[00:12:41] <ryanaz> systemfault:  yah, I'll convert eventually
[00:12:41] <hooloovoo> down with camelcase!
[00:13:05] <Blaster> if you have a selector $(this) is there a way to select all elements with the same class except the one I'm currently selecting (referenced by this)
[00:13:06] <hooloovoo> ryanaz: don't do it! stick with _ =D
[00:13:08] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: is it suppose to remain in the dragging state as if there is no relationship with the original?
[00:13:09] <systemfault> I use whatever the "standard" is for any language
[00:13:42] <polm23> In qunit, only the first test seems to run - what could I be doing wrong?
[00:13:55] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: well i don't know cause i haven't looked at the jqueryui code, but i don't think they have made it any other way.
[00:13:57] <rabbi1> this is perfect for single field, what should i do, if i have check for n number of fields to a single variable ?  var checkValid = $("form").validate().element("#username");
[00:14:05] <hooloovoo> shouldn't have a relationship with the original.
[00:15:08] <Blaster> Is there something like $(this).hasClass('test').butIsNot($(this));
[00:16:08] <systemfault> blaster: .not(this)
[00:16:45] <systemfault> Blaster: your line doesn't make much sense..
[00:17:37] <Blaster> $(this).siblings().hide(); is basically what I want to do.  Hide all the siblings
[00:18:05] <systemfault> :)
[00:18:20] <ryanaz> systemfault:  you got an example of how to build this function?   it doesn't make sense to me ..
[00:18:35] <systemfault> ryanaz: Show me what you have so far
[00:18:36] <ryanaz> function get_data(action) { return $.ajax({ url: "/api/get.cgi", cache: false, dataType: "json", type: "POST", data: { action: action }, context: document.body }).success(function(json) { if (json.status == "success") { return json; } else { alert("An error occurred, try again later."); } }); }
[00:18:51] <hooloovoo> ryanaz: jsfiddle =P
[00:20:38] <rabbi1> Kindly help me to check for n number of fields to a single variable ?  "var checkValid = $("form").validate().element("#username");" this code checks for single element #username....
[00:21:40] <ryanaz> http://jsfiddle.net/MKWxJ/
[00:23:45] <systemfault> ryanaz: The easy way http://jsfiddle.net/MKWxJ/1/
[00:24:00] <systemfault> There's also the c00lz0r way but it's more complicated..
[00:24:31] <rabbi1> systemfault: any limelight on my request ?
[00:24:51] <systemfault> rabbi1: I don't know your validate plugin.. sorry
[00:26:44] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: http://jsfiddle.net/pwmckenna/Xh8KB/6/
[00:27:02] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: drag...after one second the original diappears, and everything breaks
[00:27:05] <Blaster> Is this a good chain $(this).next('.locationSearch').toggle().siblings('.locationSearch').hide();
[00:29:31] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: hmmm, the element stays but the event seems to dissapear too
[00:29:44] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: oh right, it's still attached to the first element
[00:29:54] <hooloovoo> just hide it until the dragging is done
[00:30:11] <hooloovoo> http://jsfiddle.net/Xh8KB/7/
[00:31:09] <ryanaz> systemfault:  looks like that works like a charm... now I just gotta figure out how to do stuff with the json .... haha..... wish I could just do :  for my $type (keys(%{$json})) { .... }
[00:31:33] <systemfault> ryanaz: Man.. I don't know perl :/ Stop with the examples..
[00:31:39] <ryanaz> hahah ... love perl
[00:31:43] <systemfault> ryanaz: Just tell me what you want to do :(
[00:32:02] <systemfault> ryanaz: Iterating through the keys?
[00:32:06] <ryanaz> well, so here's the thing... check this out ... https://beta.stratfuel.com/main.cgi?page=fbo_fuel_admin
[00:32:26] <systemfault> ryanaz: cute
[00:32:57] <ryanaz> i made this whole framework in basically the last 48 hours
[00:33:09] <ryanaz> ... well, or perhaps you did.. : )
[00:33:09] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: that works, but in my case I'm not the one (or at least its not my code) destroying dom elements. It would be nice if the library handled deletions of the original gracefully...I have a patch that deleted the clone if the original is deleted and I'm wondering if its work making a pull request
[00:35:02] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: you want it to delete the clone?
[00:36:35] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: it should either delete the clone, or do what your example did, but not leak
[00:36:37] <beeviiz> hy
[00:36:38] <beeviiz> hey
[00:37:06] <beeviiz> i'm trying to fetch a html document via $.ajax() and inject the response into my current page
[00:37:09] <hooloovoo> pwmckenna: well, just patch jquery ui to do what you want. if you think it's a nice patch send it in and see what they think.
[00:37:28] <hooloovoo> cause i doubt they've thought about what to do if the original is deleted during the drag event.
[00:37:43] <beeviiz> success: function(resp) { $('#foo').html($('div', resp).filter('#content')); }
[00:38:02] <beeviiz> works fine but i'm losing all <script>elements
[00:38:19] <pwmckenna> hooloovoo: sound good...thanks for taking a look
[00:38:25] <beeviiz> probably due to security issues. any idea how i can easily get my script elements injected into the current page?
[00:38:54] <Cork> beeviiz: jquery filters out script tags and executes them in head
[00:39:02] <Cork> its to prevent memory leaks
[00:39:32] <Cork> and dubble executions
[00:40:07] <beeviiz> but i need them to be executed right after the html is injected. any idea how?
[00:40:24] <Cork> you can't with jquery
[00:40:42] <Cork> and you shouldn't build your js that way
[00:41:04] <Cork> theres no need to, and it just makes the code hard to handle
[00:42:14] <beasty> morning all
[00:43:29] <diverdude_> Is there any way i can instruct the jquery autocomplete to use a remote source which returns a json response in this format: {"items":[{"id":"someid","label":"somelabel","value":"somevalue"}]} instead of this format? [{"id":"someid","label":"somelabel","value":"somevalue"}]  ?
[00:43:31] <beeviiz> there's no other chance. i'm working on a webapp for a huge magazine with tens of thousands of subpages with hundreds of scripts inside. they need to be executed after they got loaded via xhr call. i can impossibly put all available scripts in the pagehead and use delegates to execute them.
[00:44:20] <beasty> Cork: stupid question: if i want to write a .js file OOP style .. what should i use ? new Object() , the literal notation or 'prototype' it ?
[00:44:39] <systemfault> You never use new Object()
[00:44:42] <systemfault> It's useless..
[00:45:07] <Cork> beasty: function myObjectConstrutior() {}; ur just {}
[00:45:14] <Cork> its what format you like
[00:45:19] <Cork> ur==or
[00:45:23] <beasty> so the literal notation ?
[00:45:35] <Cork> if you want a plain object yes
[00:45:36] <systemfault> Like Cork said :)
[00:45:43] <Cork> if you want a constructor, use the function
[00:45:57] <systemfault> OOP style is with function myObjectContructor() though
[00:46:08] <Cork> yup
[00:46:38] <beasty> ok thanks :)
[00:47:12] <Cork> ?eval function myClass() {  this.start = 1; return this; }; myClass.prototype.print = function() { print(this.start); };  var me = new myClass(); me.print()
[00:47:12] <caniuse> Cork: null
[00:47:17] <Cork> uh...
[00:47:44] <beasty> hmm
[00:48:00] <Cork> ?eval function myClass() { this.start = 1; return this; }; myClass.prototype.print = function() { return this.start; };  var me = new myClass(); me.print()
[00:48:00] <caniuse> Cork: 1
[00:48:04] <Cork> interesting
[00:48:23] * Cork takes a note on that one
[00:48:44] <systemfault> You don't need to return anything (from the ctor)
[00:48:57] <Cork> true
[00:49:34] <Cork> ?eval function myClass() {  this.start = 1; }; myClass.prototype.print = function() { console.log(this.start); };  var me = new myClass(); me.print()
[00:49:34] <caniuse> Cork: null
[00:49:38] <Cork> heh
[00:49:51] <Cork> so you can't talk to the console from inside functions??
[00:50:07] <systemfault> Hmm, weird :/
[00:51:01] <Cork> looks like its something about caniuse
[00:51:15] <Cork> ?eval console.log('does this work?')
[00:51:15] <caniuse> Cork: null
[00:51:17] <Cork> ah
[00:51:24] * Cork wacks caniuse 
[00:54:27] <abrkn> anyone have a snippet to detect user interaction? when the user clicks a link that opens in _blank i want to know when he returns
[01:08:17] <Eshu> HI
[01:08:20] <Eshu> Guys
[01:14:41] <thescion> I've got a link with a click event and an 'icon' span inside it. when I click on the icon, the event doesn't fire. how can I fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/R7S6r/
[01:15:11] <thescion> or rather, the payload of the event doesn't run
[01:15:50] <xec> thescion: you're checking if the target is .btn.close but it will be .icon-remove
[01:15:55] <thescion> yes
[01:16:03] <thescion> but what's a better way to write it?
[01:17:13] <Cork> thescion: http://jsfiddle.net/R7S6r/1/
[01:17:46] <xec> you have a optional filter with .on()
[01:17:46] <xec> the second param can be ".btn.close"
[01:17:46] <xec> yeah, i just made exactly what Cork did :P
[01:17:58] <thescion> thanks Cork. reading up on that arg now
[01:19:15] <thescion> nice. so that's a benefit you get from using .on()
[01:19:18] <xec> thescion: look for "delegated events"
[01:20:18] <Cork> Theowning: it does something similar to $(e.target).parents().andSelf().is('.btn.close')
[01:20:24] <thescion> out of interest, is there a neat way to avoid the ugly .parent().parent().... and hide the li at any ancestor point?
[01:20:34] <Cork> ?.closest @ thescion
[01:20:36] <thescion> I see
[01:20:47] <Cork> bah... bot-t is gone :/
[01:21:12] <Cork> Theowning: http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[01:21:18] <Cork> *thescion:
[01:21:52] <thescion> perfect
[01:23:41] <thescion> xec: look in the jq docs you mean?
[01:23:51] <xec> thescion: yes, about on
[01:23:59] <thescion> sure
[01:24:07] <Cork> thescion: the on page
[01:24:13] <thescion> thanks both :)
[01:24:21] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/on/ search there
[01:24:22] <xec> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[01:24:51] <Cork> ah, they've id'ed it now, nice
[01:25:01] <xec> yeah, just noticed :D
[01:25:23] <Cork> or maybe its been that way, don't remeber
[01:25:44] <xec> i think i've looked for it before without seeing it
[01:25:50] <xec> dunno how long ago though
[01:27:38] <rabbi1> How to check for n number of fields to a single variable ?  "var checkValid = $("form").validate().element("#username");" this code checks for single element #username....
[01:29:00] <xec> rabbi1: i don't know what .element() is ? and .validate() is a plugin of sorts?
[01:29:29] <rabbi1> xec: yeap, validation plugin
[01:29:43] <rabbi1> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[01:33:38] <ryanaz> systemfault is a stud.. just sayin
[01:35:38] <Cork> rabbi1: only thing i can find that you could use is elements()
[01:35:53] <Cork> doens't take any arguments though
[01:36:21] <rabbi1> Cork: any other way to check for valid fields in the forms ?
[01:36:30] <Cork> validElements() ?
[01:36:54] <Cork> theres also invalidElements()
[01:37:24] <rabbi1> Cork: validElements with arguments ? what i really want is i have to check for say e.g.10 elements out of 100 elements., not all and specified one
[01:38:20] <Cork> rabbi1: you could try validate().elements.filter()
[01:38:25] <Cork> rabbi1: *you could try validate().elements().filter()
[01:38:52] <rabbi1> Cork: ok thank you will have a look but element can only take 1 argument ? not more than one ?
[01:38:58] <Cork> ywes
[01:39:01] <Cork> *yes
[01:42:53] <rabbi1> Cork: filter() can have n arguments ?
[01:43:14] <diverdude_> i am trying to use the jquery autocomplete plugin as described here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data however i cannot get any event activated. I have this code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/485826549 but nothing is ever written to the console. The data is retrieved from the server though, so at least something is happening. What am I missing?
[01:45:51] <rabbi1> Cork: tried validate().element().filter('#username', #password'); has no effect...
[01:47:13] <rabbi1> how can i edit the validation.js to make the element() take more than 1 argument ?
[01:47:49] <Cork> rabbi1: elements not element
[01:47:51] <xec> diverdude_: is your site live somewhere?
[01:48:00] <Cork> validate().elements().filter('#username', #password');
[01:48:19] <xec> without the ' after username
[01:48:20] <diverdude_> xec: no, unfortunately not, but moment i will paste the response of my server
[01:48:37] <Cork> rabbi1: and it would be better to hack elements then element
[01:48:40] <rabbi1> Cork: ok that was the mistake  '
[01:49:01] <rabbi1> Cork: sorry, that was my typo
[01:49:21] <diverdude_> xec: here it is: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/922746987
[01:49:59] <ryanaz> so aparently there's no good jquery-ui selectmenu () ?
[01:50:08] <ryanaz> looks like I gotta find a hack or make my own?
[01:50:30] <diverdude_> "without the ' after username" was that for me?
[01:50:33] <xec> diverdude_: i think the autocomplete plugin expects an array
[01:50:35] <Cork> ryanaz: there is, just not in core yet
[01:50:41] <xec> no, that was for cork/rabbi1
[01:51:02] <rabbi1> Cork: sorry, that has no result either :(
[01:51:04] <ryanaz> Cork:  yah I see it out there... looks pretty cool..  it doesn't look like it's something easily able to be integrated without replacing all the scripts
[01:51:29] <ryanaz> is there a different framework anyone would recommend?
[01:51:48] <Cork> ryanaz: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138056/Selectmenu
[01:52:07] <diverdude_> xec: hmmm here its using same structure i think: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#custom-data
[01:52:14] <diverdude_> xec: if you look in the source
[01:52:39] <xec> diverdude_: look at the var projects
[01:52:55] <xec> diverdude_: it's not an object with an "items" key, it is an array
[01:53:01] <rabbi1> xec: without, or with. no expected result, it's not checking for the arguments
[01:53:34] <xec> rabbi1: sorry i'm not following the discussion, just commented on the typo in the .find()
[01:53:36] <rabbi1> should filter be inside elements(), like elements($(filter('#username,#password'))); ?
[01:53:52] <xec> rabbi1: what does .elements() return?
[01:54:44] <rabbi1> xec: i am not sure about elements() i was using element to validate for single argument, but i need to validate more than 1 argument passed to this validate(). element()/ elements()
[01:55:32] <xec> diverdude_: i'm not sure this is what's causing your issue though
[01:55:41] <xec> rabbi1:  where's the docs for this?
[01:55:54] <rabbi1> xec: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate
[01:56:03] <diverdude_> xec: hmm what else could it be?
[01:56:29] <xec> diverdude_: hard to say without a live demo i'm afraid
[01:56:38] <xec> diverdude_: do you get any errors in console?
[01:56:43] <diverdude_> xec: i mean...the console.log() in the render function should be activated nomatter what no?
[01:56:53] <diverdude_> xec: no, no errors in the log
[01:56:54] <xec> yeah i would have thought so too
[01:57:19] <xec> rabbi1: i don't see any .element() or .elements() there? or am i going blind perhaps?
[01:57:33] <diverdude_> xec: moment...ill do a fiddle
[01:58:01] <rabbi1> xec: brb
[01:59:16] <rabbi1> xec: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Validator/element
[02:02:12] <rabbi1> xec: the document says it can accept a argument under element() as element(element) . now i need to put in more than 1 argument so that the argument elements are validated .....
[02:02:18] <xec> oh, so it returns a bool
[02:02:28] <xec> what is .elements()?
[02:03:13] <xec> what exactly are you trying to do btw?
[02:04:02] <diverdude_> xec: here is a live example: http://jsfiddle.net/yKdTd/1/   as you can see the data here are the same as those from the demo:    http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote but i get js error here. Try to write in the birds-box and look at the console.
[02:07:50] <diverdude_> xec: you there?
[02:07:59] <xec> yeah looking
[02:08:40] <rabbi1> xec: var checkValid = $('form').validate().element('#username'), this line check for validity of the input field called "username" and keeps the boolean value in 'checkValid'
[02:09:37] <xec> diverdude_: if you look at the http response at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote you clearly get a json array, but that doesn't explain the error in your demo though
[02:10:00] <rabbi1> xec: and now, the element() will not accept more than one argument. say if in need to keep the validity of #username and #password to gether in 'checkValid'. so is there a workaround for that .? so i can check for more than one arguments validity
[02:10:06] <diverdude_> xec: yes exactly, so the sutocomplete should be able to handle it
[02:10:16] <diverdude_> *autocomplete
[02:10:49] <xec> rabbi1: can't you just do a validate on the entire form?
[02:11:17] <diverdude_> xec: right?
[02:11:41] <rabbi1> xec: no, i can't do that as i have many input fields in a single form which is divided in to many tabs (JQuery UI Tabs)
[02:12:25] <rabbi1> xec: so, the idea is to check for fields on the first tab and allow access to the second tab if and only if the user has satisfied the validation conditions on the first tab .... :(
[02:12:25] <xec> rabbi1: i don't see the need to be honest... but if you really need to do what you're asking i'm guessing you'd need to loop the relevant form fields and return true if the check is ok for all (both) of them
[02:13:00] <xec> rabbi1: but i've never used the validate plugin so there might be a cleaner way
[02:13:20] <xec> diverdude_: i don't follow
[02:13:27] <Cork> the validElements().is or .filter should be able to do that for you
[02:14:12] <Cork> validElements().filter('#password, #username').length > 1
[02:14:23] <rabbi1> xec: if not used validate, need to write more lines of code.... which is against 'Write Less, Do More' ! isn't it.... ? any way, we are already using it. ... so.... any other way to get more arguments in to the element() method ?
[02:14:39] <diverdude_> xec: what?
[02:14:47] <rabbi1> Cork: i tried .filter() but with out result ....
[02:14:52] <xec> diverdude_: able to handle what?
[02:14:57] <ryanaz> how do i assign the first element of an array of a json to a variable?  ie.  var first = json.[0]; ??
[02:15:06] <Cork> rabbi1: what happens?
[02:15:12] <Cork> from the code it should work just fine
[02:15:40] <diverdude_> xec: able to handle json
[02:15:40] <rabbi1> Cork: nothing, doesn't validates, returns true
[02:15:43] <xec> ryanaz: json[0] ?
[02:15:50] <ryanaz> xec: tried that.
[02:15:51] <rabbi1> Cork: can u share the page, if u have it ?
[02:16:12] <xec> ryanaz: you're sure it's an array?
[02:16:16] <Cork> rabbi1: you need to run it after the form validation, its an array of all the valid elements
[02:16:27] <Cork> rabbi1: element runs validation on the specific element
[02:16:34] <Cork> elements doens't
[02:16:34] <ryanaz> xec: ok wait that worked.. it was the next part that didn't..
[02:16:37] <Cork> it just grabs them
[02:17:02] <ryanaz> json[0].id_community;  maybe
[02:17:12] <rabbi1> Cork: array of elements is what i need
[02:17:20] <xec> diverdude_: of course, if it's well formed
[02:17:31] <Cork> then run validation on the form, then grab the validElements
[02:17:32] <ryanaz> xec: that seems to be working
[02:17:42] <diverdude_> xec: yeah...and mine is...so why this error?
[02:17:49] <Cork> filter will let you pick out just the elemenets you care about
[02:17:50] <rabbi1> Cork: so, $('form').validate().validElements().filter('#password, #username').length > 1    should work ?
[02:17:57] <Cork> yes
[02:17:58] <xec> diverdude_: yours is an object, the demo has an array
[02:18:13] <Cork> rabbi1: check so validElements() gives you an array first though
[02:18:24] <diverdude_> xec: not the one here http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote
[02:18:31] <diverdude_> xec: thats the same
[02:18:31] <xec> diverdude_: { items: [...] } is not the same as [...]
[02:18:42] <xec> diverdude_: have you looked at the http response?
[02:18:51] <diverdude_> xec: you think thats the problem?
[02:19:02] <diverdude_> xec: shouldnt it at least invoke render?
[02:19:03] <xec> honestly? not the only one, no
[02:19:07] <xec> but a problem? yes
[02:19:18] <rabbi1> Cork: that just returns false always :(
[02:19:33] <Cork> rabbi1: and validelements() ?
[02:19:41] <Cork> *validElements()
[02:19:58] <rabbi1> Cork: so, $('form').validate().validElements().filter('#password, #username').length > 1    this returns false always even i have valid input fields
[02:20:12] <Cork> rabbi1: $('form').validate().validElements()
[02:20:16] <Cork> what do you get from that
[02:20:46] <rabbi1> Cork: general user language 'It's invalid'
[02:20:56] <Cork> what?
[02:21:01] <rabbi1> so returns false, and next statement is not executed....
[02:21:07] <Cork> you get a string from validElemenets()?????
[02:21:17] <diverdude_> xec: aha...this one works: http://jsfiddle.net/yKdTd/5/
[02:21:42] <rabbi1> Cork: can u let me know what it is supposed to return true or false ?
[02:21:57] <Cork> rabbi1: its suppose to return you an array of valid elements
[02:22:03] <ryanaz> so I'm playing with selectmenu() and it appears to be working well, .... but what happens when I add more eleents to the select?  do I have to re-run it?
[02:22:16] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, let me console and have a look....
[02:22:44] <xec> diverdude_: maybe there is an invalid character in the JSON somewhere. i got an error when i tried to JSON.parse() it
[02:22:58] <rabbi1> Cork: mean time, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1022766/ this is what i am doing
[02:23:08] <diverdude_> xec: yes...but without json parse it works
[02:23:27] <ryanaz> looks like after I update it I just run selectmenu() again.. cool
[02:24:47] <rabbi1> Cork: from that code, if i console 'checkValid' i always get as false......
[02:25:07] <Cork> rabbi1: uh... your getting false from validElements() ?
[02:25:14] <Cork> that makes no sense
[02:25:30] <rabbi1> Cork: var checkValid = $('form').validate().validElements().filter('#username, #password').length>1;  here value of checkValid is always 'false' :(
[02:25:36] <Cork> ARG...
[02:25:37] <rabbi1> wether you enter a value or no
[02:25:57] <Cork> i've been asking for a good while now what you get from $('form').validate().validElements()
[02:26:13] <Cork> if you get the wrong value from >1 reduce the chain and see where it fails
[02:28:12] <rabbi1> Cork: without the filter i get [input#password.required] in the console, even after i insert value for both the fileds
[02:28:36] <Cork> so username is never valid
[02:29:58] <rabbi1> Cork: length>0 will give me true, if any one of the field is occupied,
[02:30:28] <rabbi1> Cork: so now its checking for username or password. got to get username & password condition in there .... that's it
[02:30:35] <Cork> does the array ever include username?
[02:30:43] <Cork> does it even NOT include password?
[02:31:15] <poppiez> hi, anyone else experienced image flickering in IE and opera when using $.animate?
[02:31:24] <rabbi1> Cork: includes both, but if any one is valid it return true, i guess i should try with length>-0 ; ?
[02:31:36] <rabbi1> *  .length >= 0;
[02:31:42] <Cork> uh, ya
[02:31:45] <Cork> i said > 1
[02:31:55] <Cork> as in must be more then two matches
[02:32:00] <Cork> sorry more then one
[02:33:08] <rabbi1> Cork: nope, >= 0 gives return true always :(
[02:33:26] <Cork> sigh of cource it does >_<
[02:33:39] <Cork> that means if you get anything it will be true
[02:33:43] <Cork> [] will be true
[02:34:13] <Cork> ?eval if([].length >= 0) { "this is something" }
[02:34:14] <caniuse> Cork: 'this is something'
[02:35:12] <rabbi1> Cork: never understand
[02:43:06] <rabbi1> Cork: length < 1; did the trick :) thankyou
[02:47:36] <rabbi1> Cork: another problem :(
[02:47:39] <rabbi1> may be a bug
[02:48:39] <poppiez> how do you reset css transforms/transitions instantly?
[02:51:49] <rabbi1> what is the use of lenght in ther ?
[02:55:44] <rabbi1> Cork: that doesn't give me the result, until i submit the form once .. :( later it works great
[02:56:42] <Cork> rabbi1: its checks how many elements are in the validElements().filter() response array
[02:57:56] <flayks> hi there
[02:58:05] <mathi_> hi
[02:58:19] <flayks> i have a question about jquery slidersand the stop function
[03:00:41] <flayks> i create 4 sliders automatically with a each function and for every change with the stop event, i run a function to update something. i'm just getting values of sliders —> http://pastebin.com/BxzqkMrW
[03:01:03] <flayks> my question is : how to in the comparatorupdate() function, get the values of a range slider ??
[03:02:41] <skylamer`> how to use :"contains
[03:02:43] <skylamer`> with multiple values
[03:02:49] <skylamer`> but like "or", not with all
[03:03:14] <skylamer`> do i have to make multiple :contains expressions?
[03:04:05] <skylamer`> yesi found
[03:12:56] <ryanaz> what's the best way to delete all the <option> out of a select with id=select_id ?
[03:13:35] <ravenzz> $('#select_id option').remove()
[03:13:38] <nights> im creating a graph consisting of multiples nodes. was thinking of just using html containers for the nodes and thus be able to use jquery as well, however thinking that i will need to scroll and zoom this document later. is it better to just do everything in html5 canvas to avoid painting myself into a corner?
[03:15:02] <xec> flayks: .slider("option", "values") ?
[03:15:02] <xec> flayks: if you want to read the option
[03:16:16] <ryanaz> ravenzz: perfect, thank you!!
[03:16:18] <lampe2> hey how can i get the this element in the click function? her is the code: https://gist.github.com/2867622
[03:17:53] <xec> lampe2: you can cache it - just set a var in the enclosing function
[03:18:10] <xec> lampe2: something like this is common: var self = this;
[03:18:41] <xec> (at about line 5) and then you use "self" inside the click handler
[03:19:21] <lampe2> okay thx xec
[03:20:07] <rabbi1> Cork: yeah, no problem. it does
[03:21:11] <nights> im creating a graph consisting of multiples nodes. was thinking of just using html containers for the nodes and thus be able to use jquery as well, however thinking that i will need to scroll and zoom this document later. is it better to just do everything in html5 canvas to avoid painting myself into a corner?
[03:24:01] <rabbi1> Cork: but initially, may be before i hit submit it doesn't work, after hitting submit (completion of form functionality) it works perfect .... there is a slight delay in getting the file ....
[03:24:13] <poppiez> in internet explorer, when i fadeOut() a div with text inside the text jumps around 2px to the left. known bug?
[03:24:53] <poppiez> IE8*
[03:32:33] <xec> nights: i've never attempted to make my own plotter (or graph or chart), but it makes more sense to me to use canvas than html elements, for sure
[03:55:28] <Cork> poppiez: that sounds like a common css problem, when you do animations
[03:55:43] <MindSpark> hello, is there a way I can find out the index of a jquery object among its siblings?
[03:55:44] <poppiez> Cork: yeah, I fear so too
[03:55:57] <Cork> MindSpark: .index()
[03:56:27] <Cork> poppiez: its normally fairly simple to find what causes it, and fiddle with its css to get around ti
[03:56:30] <Cork> *it
[03:56:48] <poppiez> Cork: yeah, playing with filter right now
[04:04:47] <emcken> using autocomplete, want the select event to fire if the user types something by hand and tabs which matches a result suggestion exactly, I cant figure out how its possible
[04:05:56] <emcken> ie. I'm using it to suggest house numbers like 21, 22, 23. It's much faster to just type 22 and tab instead of selecting from the suggestions - but then the "select" event is't triggered
[04:47:11] <Hippie_> on the jquery datepicker onClose i need the textfield so be reselected and then deselted .... is that possible
[04:59:34] <Flo0815> hey i have an ul. when i click on a li i want to know which child (which number) is clicked. so if the first child is clicked i want to have 1, if the second -> 2 ... anyone help?
[05:00:38] <johnkpaul> ?.index @ Flo0815
[05:01:03] <johnkpaul> Flo0815: api.jquery.com/index/
[05:02:27] <Flo0815> thx
[05:02:52] <Flo0815> another thing: is it possible to get the absolute position of an li element if it's position: relative ?
[05:04:05] <pachet> ?offset
[05:04:06] <caniuse> pachet: .offset(): Set the current coordinates of every element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[05:04:33] <Casperin> I got a problem with a $.get() request. The response looks just fine, but it's handled by its .error() — http://jsfiddle.net/bCRLt/
[05:04:34] <Flo0815> nice, thx!
[05:05:54] <pachet> $j is $? :[
[05:05:59] <pachet> people and their creative aliases
[05:06:20] <Casperin> oh, yeah.. it's to avoid conflicts with prototype (don't ask me why they use it here)
[05:08:58] <Casperin> could it be something in the header? … I normally never have this problem, and I'm completely at a loss :(
[05:09:25] <doofkopf234> hey guys. I am looking for an image slideshow plugin that supports nice image transitions (like "waterfall" / "rain" or so). So far I found a couple of them, but they assume that you have all images exactly the same size (w x h). I found none that supports mixing of portrait and landscape images. Does anyone know a plugin like that?
[05:09:30] <johnkpaul> Casperin: what is the error message?
[05:09:33] <johnkpaul> check the arguments of the error callback
[05:10:05] <Casperin> johnkpaul: how do I do that? :-/
[05:10:37] <johnkpaul> Casperin: where you have log("error"), instead use console.log(arguments)
[05:10:41] <johnkpaul> and then take a look in your console
[05:10:49] <johnkpaul> I'm assuming you're using chrome dev tools or firebug
[05:10:51] <Casperin> I'm on it.. two secs :)
[05:10:53] <Casperin> yeah
[05:11:09] <pachet> Casperin: the error event is the first argument passed into the error handler
[05:11:10] <pachet> so just log that
[05:11:21] <pachet> .error(function(e){console.log(e);})
[05:11:36] <pachet> oh im sorry, johnkpaul already answered that
[05:11:48] * pachet goes back to glugging coffee
[05:11:55] <Casperin> :P
[05:13:00] <Casperin> I got an object, "parsererror", and another object called "SyntaxError" … having a closer look at those :)
[05:13:12] <Casperin> type: "unexpected_token"
[05:14:18] <johnkpaul> pachet: :)
[05:14:27] <johnkpaul> Casperin: is your ajax call sending back javascript?
[05:15:04] <Casperin> lol pachet
[05:15:14] <Casperin> uhm.. no.. just "ok" - literally
[05:15:26] <johnkpaul> is the response type text/javascript?
[05:15:41] <SIGILL> hey, how do I select the first ".description" inside every ".container"? :first-child only checks if it's, well, the first child, not the first occurrence inside .container
[05:15:45] <johnkpaul> for some reason jquery is interpreting it as javascript, Casperin
[05:15:55] <johnkpaul> ?first @ SIGILL
[05:15:55] <caniuse> SIGILL: .first(): Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set. http://api.jquery.com/first/
[05:16:14] <Casperin> hmm how do I check that? johnkpaul-afk?
[05:16:46] <SIGILL> No, .first just gives me one element (regardless of how many .container there are)
[05:16:47] <incognit0> Hi everyone, I'm working with jQueryUI datepicker, and would like to over-ride the show/hide behaviours, can anyone lend me some thoughts on it?
[05:17:33] <incognit0> In concept I have a div around the input, and I listen to the div for any clicks that bubble up and call .datepicker("show"), which creates problems such as: the dialog might never dismiss.
[05:18:51] <Casperin> ahhh… it's being sent as json in the header… I'll grind my axe on my backend dev here. Thanks johnkpaul-afk and pachet :-)
[05:18:51] <pachet> SIGILL: $('.container .description:first')
[05:20:07] <SIGILL> pachet: that gives me one element as well
[05:21:29] <SIGILL> guess I have to use .each :-/
[05:22:13] <incognit0> I've built a small sample of my issue, can anyone advise?
[05:22:17] <Eshu> hi
[05:22:23] <incognit0> http://jsfiddle.net/BDG/9k6yS/
[05:22:41] <Eshu> i want to attach click event to this  var dropdown='<select id="head" name="head" style="width: 50%;">'+                             '<option value="20">10</option>'+                             '<option value="30">30</option>'+                             '<option value="50">50</option>'+                             '</select>';
[05:24:37] <pachet> Eshu: var dropdown = $(--> that awful string of markup you posted <-- ).on('click.mynamespace', doSomething)
[05:25:31] <pachet> be aware though that click events on select elements arent the most reliable
[05:25:36] <pachet> i would use 'change' instead
[05:31:53] <MrTopless> Hi guys do you know how to stack with jquery pngs?
[05:32:18] <MrTopless> Like Lets say I have 3 pngs one is background other two are transparent
[05:32:49] <MrTopless> When they stack up, they form one picture, but I want that stacking to go with effects
[05:33:03] <MrTopless> appearance effects so it would look like animation

[05:33:40] <MrTopless> awesome :-)
[05:33:50] <MrTopless> But gif is a bad idea :-D

[05:36:30] <pachet> SIGILL: oh i see what you mean, sorry
[05:36:49] <pachet> SIGILL: $('.container').find('.description:first')
[05:36:51] <dean[w]> The reason I'm trying to do this is to animate elements when they are beginning to enter the viewport as I scroll
[05:36:59] <youngin> mikkelb: ask me first before posting my stuff in front of loads of people
[05:37:14] <pachet> SIGILL: saves you a closure :D
[05:37:19] <pachet> vs .each
[05:37:25] <mikkelb> sorry dude!

[05:55:49] <poppiez> I'm trying to load //asset0.zendesk.com/external/zenbox/v2.1/zenbox.css using // in front so that it determines whether to use http or https by itself. however, IE8 can't handle that for CSS. bug?
[05:59:01] <incognit0> poppiez: I haven't seen that issue before, but I don't have IE to confirm for you.
[05:59:20] <poppiez> incognit0: works great for JS
[06:00:06] <hrwath> poppiez, Caveat: When used on a <link> or @import for a stylesheet, IE7 and IE8 download the file twice. All other uses, however, are just fine.
[06:00:16] <hrwath> poppiez, from http://paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/
[06:02:18] <poppiez> hrwath: that is what isn't working

[06:04:15] <tronne> but the same .children... works fine on something already there in the page
[06:04:39] <tronne> I tried just loading the other html first then doing the .children ... on it after an onload but strangely that didn't do it either

[06:06:46] <pachet> tronne: load is asynchronous by default
[06:07:04] <hrwath> poppiez, never would think of that kinda solution
[06:07:12] <tronne> I put the .children line on a new load()
[06:07:12] <poppiez> me neither
[06:07:16] <tronne> so that it would happen when it loaded
[06:07:25] <pachet> what
[06:07:31] <pachet> you mean you put it in the load callback?
[06:07:48] <hrwath> well, IE is shit so anything is possible there
[06:07:57] <pachet> $('#foo').load('bar.html', function(){$(this).children('.someClass').doSomething();});
[06:08:00] <ankit_> l
[06:08:00] <pachet> tronne^ ?
[06:08:08] <tronne> $('#yes').load('/links.html'); $('#yes').load( function(){ $('#yes').children( ...
[06:08:18] <tronne> I didn't know you could just use more arguments for that
[06:08:30] <pachet> tronne: yeah, just pass the function as the second argument there
[06:11:32] <jquerynoob> when multiple document.readys are present, is there a way to enforce that one of them is triggered first?
[06:12:43] <pachet> first in first out
[06:13:09] <fdv> Hi. has anybody here successfully used dform with validation? It seems to me a rule for one element applies to all...
[06:16:54] <MrTopless> Now i've decided not to use jquery, why jquery if I can use css animation... or Animated PNG. Easier and faster init?
[06:18:00] <pachet> if the only reason you were using jquery previously was for the caliber of animations that a png can produce...
[06:18:04] * pachet shrugs
[06:19:14] <hrwath> and how many browsers support aPNG?
[06:20:44] <pachet> only ff and opera
[06:21:41] <hrwath> yeah
[06:27:12] <MrTopless> then CSS keyframe is left :-)
[06:28:09] <pachet> RAF and canvas
[06:28:13] <pachet> go pro or go home!
[06:34:01] <Kitu> hello, how to return the "eq" of a class object on click ?
[06:34:18] <johnkpaul> Kitu: what is the eq?
[06:34:57] <pachet> ?index @ Kitu
[06:34:58] <bot-t> Kitu, .index(): Search for a given element from among the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/index/
[06:35:01] <Kitu> "$('.reply').click(function() { ..." I want the "id" who is affected by click
[06:35:24] <Kitu> ok
[06:36:38] <Kitu> index is already "2"
[06:37:03] <Haprog> Kitu: the variable "this" will be the DOM node for the element with class reply that was clicked on
[06:37:13] <Haprog> so inside the onclick function you can do $(this)
[06:37:34] <Kitu> $('.reply').click(function() { alert($(this).index()); }); This return always "2"
[06:38:11] <Kitu> yes ...
[06:38:51] <Haprog> hmm
[06:40:21] <pachet> var $reply = $('.reply').on('click.mynamespace', function(){alert($reply.index(this));});
[06:41:40] <Kitu> ok pachet, I try
[06:43:39] <Haprog> What's wrong with jsfiddle.net ? It doesn't work with Firefox anymore?
[06:43:55] <fdv> it does here
[06:44:10] <Haprog> The HTML,CSS,JavaScript editors are all disabled on my FF (can't write to any of them)
[06:44:15] <Haprog> works fine on Chrome though
[06:44:37] <jeffsmykil>  $('selector').next().next()
[06:44:57] <jeffsmykil> what is the more appropriate way of doing  $('selector').next().next()
[06:44:59] <Kitu> thx pachet
[06:45:37] <fdv> anybody familiar with dform who could have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/JXUZb/ ? Am I using the validation plugin correctly?
[06:46:04] <Haprog> ok jsfiddle started working in FF after I cleared my cache
[06:47:10] <ignotus> hi, I have $('<input type="button">').val('&amp;'), but I see the string "&amp;" as the button text instead of a "&" character, how can I get it to do what I mean?
[06:48:15] <Haprog> ignotus: if you want it to show & why don't you just set the value to & then?
[06:48:20] <pachet> jeffsmykil: $(foo).nextAll(':eq(1)') maybe
[06:49:14] <pachet> personally i think .next().next() is easier to understand, but
[06:51:18] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody why this line is returning a 'method toLowerCase undefined"?   $(this).val($(this).val().replace(/\D/g, ''));
[06:51:38] <DeltaHeavy> The code is from an external JS file and the error is being reported from jQuery.js
[06:52:55] <Xotix> does someone know tinymce here? how cna i set the css for the body tag? inline css
[06:53:28] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: i'd need to see some context
[06:53:39] <pachet> i think its a problem with what 'this' is pointing to in that case
[06:53:50] <diverdude> when using jquery autocomplete with a remote source, how do i access the text which was written in the textbox by the user, so that i can send it to the server in each lookup request?
[06:53:53] <pachet> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L165
[06:53:56] <pachet> DeltaHeavy^
[06:54:02] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Let me whip up a jsfiddle
[06:55:29] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: What's that link for exactly? Here's my context: http://jsfiddle.net/k76z5/
[06:55:30] <Xotix> diverdude val() and maybe timeout for 50ms. on each keydown. or something like this., but this will create lots  of request… rather use a list which the used loads and which can be cached. probably a very common problem.
[06:56:12] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: its to show where the jquery .toLowerCase call happens in .va()
[06:56:14] <pachet> er, .val()
[06:56:20] <diverdude> Xotix: well cannot cache the list since i cannot predict what user will type and dont want to download entire db
[06:56:36] <Chepra_> Hi! What happens when i am doing $(funcname); several times?
[06:56:41] <Chepra_> (for the same func)
[06:57:55] <diverdude> Xotix: and where do i do the val() ? afaik i can only set the source in autocomplete...and cannot call val() there
[06:58:26] <pachet> Chepra_: they're all passed in to jquery's internal listener for document.ready
[06:58:36] <pachet> so they'll fire once the dom is manipulable
[06:58:37] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: What do I do with this code you linked me? Replace jQuery.js with it?
[06:58:45] <Chepra_> pachet: so the function will be only called once?
[06:58:47] <pachet> otherwise, if you pass them in after that point, they'll fire instantly
[06:59:00] <pachet> Chepra_: no, it should be called for each time you pass it in
[06:59:05] <Chepra_> Oh
[06:59:06] <Chepra_> Ok
[06:59:32] <Chepra_> I am trying to simulate a callback queue, adding callbacks from various parts of the code and fire them after document.ready
[07:00:35] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: no, it was just for you to look at
[07:00:41] <pachet> DeltaHeavy: but your issue was one of scope
[07:00:43] <pachet> here you go:
[07:00:44] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/jE7re/
[07:01:30] <pachet> Chepra_: well, passing fns into $() will fire them in the order they were added
[07:01:46] <pachet> so i guess that could be considered a queue :[
[07:02:43] <Xotix> diverdude ah ups i missread what you wrote. Idk autocomplete, i thought you are doing it from scratch
[07:02:49] <DeltaHeavy> pachet: Thanks!
[07:05:13] <ignotus> pachet: sorry, my exampple was to simplistic, I want to show &ndash; for example
[07:06:21] <diverdude> when using jquery autocomplete with a remote source, how do i access the text which was written in the textbox by the user, so that i can send it to the server in each lookup request?
[07:07:48] <Chepra_> pachet: I thought I could use some deferred-thingy, but this does not seem appropiate
[07:10:26] <Chepra_> pachet: ah, now I knot what you were talking about. In the various party i just want to do: callbacks.queue.push(function() {}); not adding the $(....) thingy everywhere
[07:10:44] <Chepra_> (the callback-queue) manipulates the functions (kind of)
[07:14:09] <dipser> is there a difference between $(document).on('click', 'a[href]:not([class="nopush"])', function(e) { ......and $(elem).live() ?
[07:15:57] <fdv> ok, it seems my issue isn't with dform, but rather with validate. anybody familiar with validate who can have a glance at http://jsfiddle.net/JXUZb/1/ ? I would think the two fields should have different valid ranges...
[07:17:08] <bakaneko> hi
[07:17:42] <mantas322> Hi I have a strange problem
[07:17:42] <mantas322> When my jquery libraries are included in my page, an html POST ignores my URL parameters
[07:17:54] <Xotix> how can i add inline css to the body of a tinymce instance?
[07:17:54] <mantas322> why would this happen?
[07:18:30] <bakaneko> is it possible to apply css to an element of a redirected page after .click() function ?
[07:18:40] <mantas322> why is jquery modifying my Request URL and removing the params
[07:18:41] <mantas322> ?
[07:18:47] <mantas322> hmm
[07:21:20] <bakaneko> http://paste.org.ru/?jhc2gl
[07:21:49] <wolfman2000> Morning. I'm using jQuery 1.7.2 on a website that uses this gallery. http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/  Clicking on the smaller gallery images work, but is there a way to click on an extra "view gallery" image/link to get the same gallery to show?
[07:22:30] <dipser> bakaneko no only if you tell the next page what you want to do
[07:22:42] <bakaneko> ..
[07:23:06] <bakaneko> crap
[07:23:10] <gorh> hi there, silly question incoming, i'm trying to use append() to get an url, in my array my link is "/var/mobile/..." it comes out as "  var mobile …" is there a way to have it unescaped ?
[07:23:42] <dipser> you can write singlepages or use a querystring
[07:24:25] <mythgarr> If I have some HTML that looks something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QGMfK/ how can I hide all of the tr elements (except the one that contains MyContent)?
[07:28:01] <pachet> mythgarr: http://jsfiddle.net/JjSFc/
[07:32:11] <mythgarr> pachet: Thanks!
[07:33:52] <mythgarr> Hmm - I just saw how you did that - how might I fix it if I have multiple tables, and I ONLY want to hide those specific rows? (http://jsfiddle.net/JjSFc/1/)
[07:35:17] <pachet> how do you know which table to use?
[07:35:25] <pachet> whichever one the MyContent element is in?
[07:35:55] <johnkpaul> mythgarr: pachet $('tr').not($('#MyContent').parent("tr")).remove();​​
[07:37:10] <mythgarr> johnkpaul: That seems to remove everything...
[07:37:58] <pachet> you want .closest()
[07:38:00] <pachet> not .parent()
[07:38:06] <pachet> but its still cute, johnkpaul++
[07:38:09] <johnkpaul> ah right, sorry :)
[07:38:16] <pachet> http://jsfiddle.net/R8RKm/
[07:40:41] <jeffsmykil_> Am I using on incorectly?
[07:40:41] <jeffsmykil_> http://jsfiddle.net/VSkz4/1/
[07:40:48] <jeffsmykil_> when I use live in it's place it works fine
[07:41:56] <mythgarr> pachet , johnkpaul: Not quite there, but a great start - thanks!
[07:42:20] <Xotix> How can i access style attrb of an element within an iframe? same domain
[07:44:34] <jeffsmykil_> hrm
[07:45:39] <jeffsmykil_> maybe i dont need live or on
[07:45:49] <mythgarr> pachet , johnkpaul: FYI - ended up with http://jsfiddle.net/R8RKm/1/ (using siblings() instead of closest() and find())
[07:46:17] <jeffsmykil_> wow I had 0 problems until today but coda is crashing on me like crazy today :/
[07:46:23] <rabbi1> which is the best jquery gantt chart plugin on performance wise
[07:52:16] <rabbi1> none of you used any ?
[07:53:14] <dipser> is there a difference between $(document).on('click', 'a[href]:not([class="nopush"])', function(e) { ......and $(elem).live() ?
[07:53:32] <Xotix> how can i access the body of some html within a var? e.g. $(importData.html).find('body') this doesn't work but echoing the html as a string shows a body, so its there
[07:54:19] <diverdude> did anybody combine twitter-bootstrap modalbox with jquery autocomplete? The problem is that the jquery autocomplete suggestions appear behind the twitter modalbox. How can i fix that?
[07:54:32] <jeffsmykil_> live is depreciated iirc dipser
[07:55:13] <dipser> really?
[07:55:24] <freeed> jeffsmykil_, it is? :\
[07:55:55] <jeffsmykil> As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().
[07:56:12] <freeed> ahhh replaced by .on() http://api.jquery.com/live/  good to know - thanks jeffsmykil for mentioning that
[07:56:53] <gorh> hi there, i'm trying to generatbutton, with links from an array, but my output is escaping '/' how could i prevent that ? (exemple : http://jsfiddle.net/gorhgorh/4FNSK/  )
[08:07:45] <kavelot> what's the recommended way to setup the "ready" function of jquery? $(document).ready, $().ready, something else?
[08:07:57] <diverdude> is jquery dying?
[08:09:05] <gorh> hi there, i'm trying to generate buttons, with links that are stored in an array, but my output is escaping '/' how could i prevent that ? (exemple : http://jsfiddle.net/gorhgorh/4FNSK/  )
[08:09:33] * ZUZ3L is closing down
[08:09:48] <gorh> i'm generating the buttons with .append()
[08:10:06] <silverwind> kavelot, $(document).ready(function()) or $(function())
[08:10:36] <rabbi1> Cork: u there sir ?
[08:11:23] <kavelot> silverwind: thanks
[08:12:13] <rabbi1> silverwind: any limelight on this ? http://49.249.126.221/omms/logon.html
[08:16:01] <silverwind> rabbi1, What's wrong
[08:16:44] <rabbi1> silverwind: the user should be able to go to next tab if and only if all the validations are satisfied in the previous tab.
[08:17:35] <rabbi1> i am using a validate plugin for this. the validation works good. but it moves to next tab even one of the input field is true (valid) not both ...
[08:19:04] <diverdude> did anybody combine twitter-bootstrap modalbox with jquery autocomplete? The problem is that the jquery autocomplete suggestions appear behind the twitter modalbox. How can i fix that?
[08:19:58] <rimmikhan> hi abc
[08:20:24] <rimmikhan> please tell me the script
[08:23:57] <diverdude> ajpiano: hey, do you have a moment?
[08:24:54] <xec> diverdude: sounds like a css (z-index) issue
[08:25:33] <diverdude> xec: yeah...but which element do i set the z-index on
[08:25:49] <gorh> anyone know how coul i prevent .append() to escape '/' from the values i'm trying to append ?
[08:26:40] <xec> diverdude: dunno, which one needs fixing? inspect them using dev tools or firebug or whatever
[08:26:55] <xec> check their properties
[08:28:41] <lan3y> would be where ever the autocomplete is used, i would suggest
[08:31:12] <poppiez> why is IE8 so extremely slow at handling `mousedown`. if I click two times next after each other, only one `mousedown` event is registered
[08:34:06] <poppiez> so I have 1 mousedown, and 2 mouseups. /wrists
[08:34:43] <lan3y> poppiez: it's IE8, were you really expecting better?
[08:36:15] <poppiez> sigh. IE 5-8 uses the following event order: mousedown, mouseup, click, mouseup, dblclick
[08:39:23] <sublimenal1> hi there im trying to submit a form after changing the value of a hidden field.  is this how you would do somethjing like that? http://pastebin.com/xy1AThCN
[08:42:54] <RonaldoMcDonald> Hello everyone, I have a: object > method > jquery toggle. Now, from within the toggle I need to access 'this' in the context of the object. I'm trying to use proxy but am "not getting it" any help?
[08:48:42] <mantas322> Hey guys I just learned something really really interesting about    ( jquery  + coldfusion + file upload + url params )
[08:49:09] <mantas322> so I have a coldfusion page with some url params and a html form which submits a file upload control
[08:49:15] <mantas322> now!
[08:49:42] <mantas322> when this form is submitted there are some url params that get used in the event of that submit
[08:49:55] <mantas322> those params are eliminated by jquery!
[08:50:25] <mantas322> the question is WHY on earth would jquery tell me my url params are undefined when they are clearly there in the address bar
[08:50:41] <piker32> you using $.ajax?
[08:50:46] <mantas322> no
[08:50:58] <mantas322> I'm just referencing two jquery libraries
[08:51:05] <mantas322> <script src="jquery.mobile-1.1.0/jquery-1.7.1.js"></script> <script src="jquery.mobile-1.1.0/jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.js"></script>
[08:51:09] <mantas322> within my coldfusion page
[08:51:18] <NoiseEee> mantas322: whatever is happening is happening because you've programmed it so
[08:51:23] <mantas322> wrong
[08:51:25] <NoiseEee> or failed to do something, etc
[08:51:40] <mantas322> I was missing " data-ajax=false"    within my html form
[08:51:48] <mantas322> which solved all of my problems
[08:51:59] <mantas322> if u have a page with a html form that submits to itself
[08:52:04] <mantas322> and you are referencing jquery libraries
[08:52:10] <mantas322> they will mess up you submit
[08:52:23] <sublimenal1> thats in the jquery mobile documentation
[08:52:26] <NoiseEee> ah thats a mobile thing
[08:52:28] <mantas322> and if u do it in chrome u will see for a brief moment that its doing this\
[08:52:40] <mantas322> its tryign to do this mypage.cfm/#mypage.cfm
[08:53:12] <piker32> is there a reason for it to post to a server?
[08:53:25] <mantas322> I have to do a file upload
[08:53:41] <piker32> ah, yes
[08:53:43] <mantas322> and there needs to be logic in the type of file thats allowed to be uploaded
[08:53:44] <mantas322> etc
[08:54:36] <piker32> you definitely could have chosen a better route to approach that topic
[08:55:14] <mantas322> Well I wasnt really understanding what the problem was ealier
[08:55:14] <mantas322> all i know is my uyrl params are being eliminated by jquery libraries
[09:19:43] <gho5t> when using a jquery ui widget, if themebuilder isn't giving you enough control over styling it, do you guys typically override the styles within the jquery-ui stylesheet or do you just do it in your site's core css files?
[09:21:08] <xec> gho5t: i usually just use the jquery-ui stylesheet as a start (and then rip it apart, removing too much, break everything and start over again)
[09:21:53] <xec> holy mother of internets
[09:22:12] <RonaldoMcDonald> gho5t, it makes sense to make a separate one so all your changes are visible and you can start over if you wish.
[09:27:34] <gho5t> xec: so you do this within the jquery stylesheet right?
[09:27:35] <gho5t> rather than in your own site.css e.g. file
[09:27:37] <xec> gho5t: yes
[09:27:37] <gho5t> cool just wanted to see what other are doing

[09:27:55] <daniel> Is there a way to get jquery ui drag to ignore with width/height of a border for snapping?
[09:30:45] <mantas322> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2001
[09:30:45] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2001 on jquery-mobile (jeffholmes; 11m, 5d ago): IE7/8 Form Submit Bug
[09:30:45] <mantas322> fuck!!
[09:31:08] <aberrant> hi all
[09:33:03] <RonaldoMcDonald> Challenge: Gentlemen, i'm using $.proxy to move 'this' context back to my calling object; standard. But within the proxy function, i want to make 1 call like so: $(this.el).blah(); but it's not working even though this.el is correctly referring to a dom element
[09:33:35] <RonaldoMcDonald> any ideas?
[09:34:30] <aberrant> I have a large number of forms set up in a table structure. Each column has its own set of instructions. I'd like to display the column's instructions underneath the table, having it change depending on which form has focus. Possible?
[09:35:38] <mantas322> the jquery devs claim that 1.1 fixed the issue
[09:35:47] <mantas322> but they havent :/
[09:37:00] <aberrant> Not sure this made it past the rejoin: I have a large number of forms set up in a table structure. Each column has its own set of instructions. I'd like to display the column's instructions underneath the table, having it change depending on which form has focus. Possible?
[09:37:29] <NoiseEee> of course
[09:37:52] <aberrant> NoiseEee: could you point me to a place to start reading about how to do this? I haven't used jquery before.
[09:37:54] <16SABBUHM> Is there a way to get jquery ui drag to ignore with width/height of a border for snapping?
[09:38:29] <NoiseEee> aberrant: well you'd need to be familiar with javascript to do that kind of thing.  jquery is javascript, perhaps intros to both would be helpful
[09:38:50] <aberrant> NoiseEee: hm, ok. Will keep reading the jquery docs.
[09:39:34] <NoiseEee> aberrant: basically you'd set whatever is holding all the forms to 'listen' to a focus event; figure out what form it happened on, and then use .html() to change the contents of whatever dom element you wanted to
[09:40:08] <aberrant> NoiseEee: I can use the <tr> id as a selector?
[09:40:37] <NoiseEee> you can use whatever you want, but what do you mean
[09:40:38] <aberrant> er, it would be a class, not an id
[09:40:53] <aberrant> well, the tr's class would be the name of the column.
[09:41:02] <NoiseEee> well really it would be on a <td> no?
[09:41:11] <aberrant> since the text below the table would change when the focus changes if the user switches columns, ....
[09:41:21] <aberrant> yeah, crap, sorry, td
[09:41:27] <aberrant> still haven't had my coffee yet
[09:41:42] <NoiseEee> exactly, so your <td> would hold some sort of reference to the message and/or item to be updated
[09:41:51] <NoiseEee> either an id, something in a 'data-' attribute, etc
[09:41:52] <NoiseEee> a class
[09:41:53] <NoiseEee> etc
[09:43:12] <aberrant> right
[09:43:19] <aberrant> this is within a django template.
[09:43:30] <kba> anybody here experienced with using zclip? I can't get it to work properly. I have a site, when I place the trigger box, in this case <div id="test">TEST</div> at the top of my document, it works well
[09:43:33] <aberrant> so I have the td classes there now - capability-X, where X is an index.
[09:43:44] <kba> but the moment I move it below a table that I fill with content dynamically, it doesn't work anymore
[09:44:32] <kba> or that is, just placing it below the table is fine, but the moment I fill the table with data, then the TEST div isn't triggering anything anymore
[09:44:34] <Kaltiz> With this .each() thing, do I have to put it into a function, or can I continue use use subsequet functions?
[09:45:07] <Kaltiz> Like can I do $('#puAdd .slideRow').each().css('padding,'0px')
[09:45:32] <kba> http://paste.debian.net/hidden/b7c2e339/ that's the function that's being executed. When that's being executed, zclip doesn't work
[09:49:00] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: yes, you can do that, .each returns the same jquery object
[09:49:39] <Kaltiz> johnkpaul will that preform that function on each thing selected though?
[09:50:02] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: what function?
[09:50:05] <Kaltiz> do I even need the .each() to do that?
[09:50:13] <Kaltiz> .css('padding
[09:50:14] <johnkpaul> to change the css of every .slideRow?
[09:50:16] <johnkpaul> no, you don't need .each
[09:50:28] <kba> I'm using zClip on my site. After appending some tr's to a table (that zclip isn't really involved with), zclip doesn't work anymore, unless it's positioned before the table in the document. Any ideas what might cause this?
[09:50:32] <johnkpaul> that's jquery functionality already Kaltiz
[09:50:42] <johnkpaul> .css() affects every item in the jqobj
[09:50:52] <johnkpaul> .each() is a noop, you need a function inside for it to do something
[09:50:59] <Kaltiz> Lol i've been doing these XD $('#puAir .slideRow').each(function(){$(this).slideDown('slow');});
[09:51:28] <johnkpaul> :) save yourself some typing then, Kaltiz
[09:52:18] <Kaltiz> can I do .slideUp.css
[09:52:42] <kba> I figured it out, it turns it zClip hates when something has just a number as an id.
[09:52:42] <aberrant> NoiseEee: ok, I got the focus handler written :)
[09:52:56] <Kaltiz> And does .parent also do the same thing, selecting the parent of each one?
[09:53:08] <aberrant> now I gotta figure out how to extract the class designator, and then display the proper text.
[09:53:18] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: try it and see
[09:53:29] <johnkpaul> to both of your questions
[09:54:11] <mantas322> i didnt realize form submission + jquery + IE  = So Problematic
[09:55:07] <Kaltiz> Uhh what about doing these $('#someclass').css().$('td')
[09:55:28] <kba> No, that wasn't it. Fuck zClip
[09:56:45] <johnkpaul> Kaltiz: no, there is no $.fn.$
[09:56:54] <johnkpaul> do you want to find all of the td's undernearth someclass?
[09:56:56] <johnkpaul> ?find @ Kaltiz
[09:56:57] <bot-t> Kaltiz, .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[09:58:03] <mantas322> "We stopped testing jQuery mobile on IE since lots of stuff doesn't work, if it works fine on all the phones and Chrome/FF why bother I guess - it's intended for the phone and you can for the most part develop in Chrome – Clay Liu Feb 8 at 17:17"
[09:58:07] <mantas322> awe shucks!
[09:58:46] <Kaltiz> Can jquery select the same element twice? or does it know?
[10:01:13] <aberrant> so how do I get the class name of an enclosing <td> if I'm using an input within <td> as a target?
[10:04:41] <jenia> hello everyone. if i remove an element from the html page and then append back it exact copy (id and tag are the same - everything is the same) should the call back still work?
[10:05:56] <ZeroBeholder> Kalitz, you might have to .parent() a few times.
[10:07:00] <ZeroBeholder> Wait, I misread that. Just once. But, .parent() moves the pointer from your current element to the parent element.
[10:07:28] <ZeroBeholder> Then the methods and whatnot that follow are applied to the parent element.
[10:08:16] <ZeroBeholder> If you are doing multiple ones, you may also want to look into each().
[10:10:48] <ZeroBeholder> +1000 Internets for sharing that little ray of sunshine mantas322. I despise IE. Even if Microsoft started making a good browser, I don't know that it would be enough to quell the black spot on my heart.
[10:11:40] <ZeroBeholder> I have taken for granted the browsing experience on my Android device and those of all my people. From today on I will remember to be grateful that no mobile devices use Internet Explorer.
[10:12:02] <Kaltiz> Hmm this doesn't seem to work? $('#puAdd .slideRow,#puAdd2 .slideRow').slideUp('slow').parentsUntil('tr').find('td').css('padding','0em');
[10:12:19] <ZeroBeholder> what is .parentsUntil?
[10:12:44] <ZeroBeholder> May just be my own ignorance showing.
[10:12:54] <Kaltiz> http://api.jquery.com/parentsUntil/
[10:14:13] <ZeroBeholder> Can padding just be 0 all the time and have the inner elements with margin?
[10:16:43] <panzi> (jquery ui draggable+sortable) when dragging an element into a sortable, is it possible that a different element than was dragged will be inserted? I want to insert the helper that is displayed during dragging
[10:16:47] <gho5t> when you need to alter a jquery ui widget, is it all right to edit the source or do most of you just do it in an external js file?
[10:17:54] <ZeroBeholder> Sorry guys, I know too little about ui...
[10:19:02] <DeltaHeavy> I'm using jQuery to add a hover effect with .hover to an image, however when that image is clicked, it changes but when I'm not hovering over that anymore it changes back to it's original form. What's the best way to approach what I'm trying to do?
[10:20:14] <ZeroBeholder> I think .hover() .one() or .once() might be something worth checking out.
[10:20:23] <hlveshorthair> Quick, what's the best way to use math.random to find a random number between 0, and 3?
[10:20:27] * hlveshorthair looks around
[10:21:32] <ZeroBeholder> .onmouseover() may be better because .hover reverts as you .onmouseout
[10:22:18] <_trev> ~~Math.random() * 4
[10:22:26] <ZeroBeholder> That is going to be straight up javascript which melds just fine with the rest of your jQuery hlvesshorhair.
[10:22:36] <_trev> er
[10:22:43] <_trev> ~~(Math.random * 4 )
[10:22:57] <_trev> er...
[10:22:58] <_trev> lol
[10:23:12] <_trev> Thats' 0 - 3
[10:23:20] <ZeroBeholder> _trev has the idea right because the span of numbers begins at 0.
[10:23:36] <brettster> hey guys. I have a simply jquery image swap with onclick
[10:23:43] <brettster> my question is how can i toggle it.
[10:23:43] <_trev> ~~(Math.random * 3 ) + 1
[10:23:44] <brettster> http://pastie.org/4026541
[10:24:00] <_trev> thats 1-3 :)
[10:24:04] <hlveshorthair> _trev, if I do that, then 0 will never be possible
[10:24:04] <hlveshorthair> lol
[10:24:21] <hlveshorthair> so just (Math.random * 3 ) o_0
[10:24:22] <_trev> Right, just giving you the idea
[10:24:25] <_trev> No
[10:24:27] <hlveshorthair> er
[10:24:28] <hlveshorthair> 4*
[10:24:28] <hlveshorthair> lol
[10:24:29] <_trev> You need two tildas
[10:24:42] <_trev> Thats a shortcut for Math.floor
[10:24:45] <_trev> Sortof :P
[10:25:02] <ZeroBeholder> brettster I duck a lot of information in title="information I need" properties/attributes/whatever
[10:25:13] <_trev> Invrses bits twice
[10:25:19] <brettster> huh?
[10:25:32] <ZeroBeholder> you can stick your information in there and use jquery somewhat easily to swap the img.src with information in the title.
[10:26:52] <ZeroBeholder> Your onclick uses ='FIRSTIMGNAME,otherimagename' to switch from the FIRSTIMGNAME which is in the src already or the other one if it isn't detected.
[10:26:53] <Reginald_T_B> hey folks, I have what I think is an easy question, I have a loop that does  a few getJSON commands, and I think that the code after my loop is being executed before they're done, is there a function that I can use to tell the other functions to wait until the looping is done?
[10:27:23] <imsky> grawgrgaera
[10:27:24] <bot-t> (276 hours ago) <abjorn> tell imsky you heard me bitch
[10:27:27] <hlveshorthair> var Numbr = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5), should find 0-4, no?
[10:27:37] <hlveshorthair> BOT-T IS BACK!
[10:27:42] <hlveshorthair> PRAISE THE LAWDS BOT-T IS BACK
[10:28:24] <ZeroBeholder> your filenames go in the title attribute. you compare the current src with what is in the title attribute. if = to the first one use the second one, else use the first one.
[10:29:06] <ZeroBeholder> you can substring using the comma to dig the values out.
[10:29:32] <ZeroBeholder> I think it is less work than building arrays and looking for the other filename that way.
[10:29:52] <ZeroBeholder> all the information you need is built right in to the tag you are manipulating that way.
[10:30:06] <ZeroBeholder> that way
[10:30:08] <ZeroBeholder> that way.
[10:30:10] <ZeroBeholder> cripes
[10:31:22] <ZeroBeholder> <img src="./directory/FILENAME1.EXT" title="FILENAME1.EXT,FILENAME2.EXT" />
[10:31:48] <panzi> is there a way to overload $.fn.clone for a particular element? I can do element.cloneNode = ..., but that seems messy to me
[10:32:28] <ZeroBeholder> Brettster Then you use jQuery/javascript to take apart the title into it's two parts and compare. Change the img.src attribute based on which one it is.
[10:32:40] <abjorn> imsky: sup ho
[10:32:40] <bot-t> (3 mins 45 secs ago) <imsky> tell abjorn oi guvnah
[10:33:13] <brettster> yeah
[10:33:19] <brettster> im having a hard time getting this
[10:33:42] <imsky> abjorn, monday monday monday! rain everywhere and work ahead
[10:34:23] <abjorn> lol nice nice
[10:34:27] <abjorn> im being lazy today
[10:34:32] <imsky> are you even at work
[10:34:35] <abjorn> naw
[10:34:39] <imsky> damn that's lazy
[10:34:43] <imsky> i thought mexicans are hardworking
[10:34:46] <abjorn> lol ill go in at some point...
[10:35:07] <imsky> i've been so hunkered down with work, i dont even know what to tweet about
[10:35:16] <imsky> reading other people's shit is just depressing
[10:36:00] <imsky> ["random bitch about industry shit", "some observation", "photo of food", "retweet from an 'advice' or 'quotes' account"]
[10:36:05] <imsky> pick one o dose!!
[10:37:02] <imsky> abjorn, there needs to be like a long-form twitter. something where the posts are longer and can have more details, media, and context
[10:37:12] <imsky> man someone really needs to get on that, it'd be a huge market
[10:37:17] <abjorn> rofl
[10:38:08] <imsky> what's going on at the gator? the sleazebags get found out?
[10:38:10] <abjorn> there sure are a lot of photos of food and shit in my twitter feed
[10:38:32] <abjorn> hipsters with their instagram food pictures
[10:38:35] <ZeroBeholder> brettster well, you could name your files in pairs and change the source from FILE.EXT to FILEMOUSEOVER.EXT then just change the source by adding or removing MOUSEOVER...
[10:39:45] <ZeroBeholder> brettster, how new are you at this? It's fine if you haven't been doing it long. I am new myself.
[10:41:48] <Jannertje> hi guys, I'm trying to use the jquery selectors on a page I loaded with ajax, however I can't make it work. Ive tried the web and all to no avail. What I have (paraphrased): ``$.ajax({url: "url", success: function(contents) { console.log($(contents)); } });''
[10:42:44] <Jannertje> tis log shows me a bunch of stuff I dont understand but when I do ``console.log($(contents).html());'' I get a null value
[10:43:42] <Eviltwin> Interesting: http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/
[10:44:57] <hlveshorthair> strange jitter effect that I'm getting with IE and not with firefox when using Math.random to pick a random number to start this slider on.
[10:45:20] <hlveshorthair> I can't really mock it up quickly, just wondering if anybody has had a similar sounded problem
[10:45:28] <hlveshorthair> sounding*
[10:46:29] <brettster> zerobeholder
[10:46:39] <ZeroBeholder> yep
[10:46:41] <johnkpaul-afk> Eviltwin: yeah, I'm glad that ben_alman wrote that up
[10:46:54] <johnkpaul-afk> I've had the same thought, but wanted the hipster trend swayed me
[10:47:02] <brettster> why wont this work
[10:47:03] <brettster> http://pastie.org/4026672
[10:47:36] <johnkpaul> brettster: what do you mean when you say won't work
[10:47:42] <johnkpaul> nothing after a return statement runs
[10:47:49] <johnkpaul> so lines 5 and 13 are never executed
[10:48:01] <brettster> ahh
[10:48:08] <DeltaHeavy> After I run something through .off, is there any way to reverse that without redeclaring the entire event?
[10:48:09] <Eviltwin> Also line 13 almost certainly shouldn't have the ".menulink"
[10:48:28] <brettster> im trying to switch back and forth the classes
[10:48:31] <brettster> to toggle the image
[10:48:34] <johnkpaul> ?toggleClass @ brettster
[10:48:34] <brettster> on click
[10:48:34] <bot-t> brettster, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[10:48:35] <Eviltwin> It should be "menulink"
[10:49:04] <Eviltwin> Also unless you refactor this, you're going to need to use event delegation
[10:49:17] <Eviltwin> But I suggest you see ?.toggle(...,...)
[10:49:18] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[10:49:52] <Eviltwin> ...which is actually here: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[10:50:03] <ZeroBeholder> You are using a class selector which returns a list of items. http://jsfiddle.net/6yguJ/
[10:50:10] <hlveshorthair> <:/
[10:50:34] <ZeroBeholder> You are also using a non-delegated click event handler. What version of jQuery are you including?
[10:50:49] <hlveshorthair> i'm getting strange jitter effect that I'm getting with IE and not with firefox when using Math.random to pick a random number to start this slider on... I can't really mock it up quickly in jsfiddle, but it basically is defaulting at 0, and quickly jumping to the said random number that is picked with math.random, just wondering if anybody has had a similar sounding problem
[10:50:51] <hlveshorthair> >:/
[10:51:29] <Eviltwin> hlveshorthair: Your description is rather vague and without the ability to reproduce, I doubt we'll be able to help you
[10:52:23] <ZeroBeholder> Being non-delegated doesn't matter. Sorry melding your issue with somehting I am doing now.
[10:52:26] <aqqqq> Hey, what do I have to do so the jquery would recognize my variable inside the callback? http://jsbin.com/elotos
[10:53:10] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: Uh... I see two lines of code
[10:53:13] <Eviltwin> And no callback
[10:53:47] <johnkpaul> aqqqq: http://jsbin.com/elotos/2/edit
[10:53:52] <hlveshorthair> Hmph
[10:55:46] <aqqqq> johnkpaul, if it would be like that I would have solved it :)
[10:56:23] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: So...where is this callback?
[10:56:23] <twiq> I'm using jqtouch and it doesn't show only one div at a time, it's showing all of them.. what have I done wrong?
[10:56:24] <aqqqq> johnkpaul, the idea is that I'll have elements with id aX, and I'll need to fade them out and in
[10:56:56] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, isn't the function as the second parameter called callback?
[10:56:58] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how to "undo" a .off? I could use .on but as far as my understanding goes I'd have to define the entire event again.
[10:57:50] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: This is the JavaScript you linked: http://cl.ly/3g3s0o2Z2M041c2e2N0c
[10:57:56] <johnkpaul> aqqqq: something like this? http://jsbin.com/elotos/3/edit
[10:58:00] <hlveshorthair> i don't know how else to word it and i can't replicate the entire slider in jsfiddle.
[10:58:02] <hlveshorthair> hmph
[10:58:13] <ZeroBeholder> brettster, if you are here I've tweaked it a little in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/6yguJ/1/
[10:58:33] <Eviltwin> johnkpaul: I wouldn't rely on Array.prototype.map being there
[11:00:07] <johnkpaul> Eviltwin: yeah, good point, easy to switch to $.map(ids, func)
[11:00:24] <codeshah> hey guys, right now I have a login form, and it auto saves my login/password… but dont want that.
[11:00:28] <johnkpaul> Eviltwin: I was more showing the idea
[11:01:34] <hlveshorthair> codeshah, so make jquery clear the text in the textboxes on page load..
[11:01:39] <codeshah> k
[11:01:59] <hlveshorthair> but then again, it's nice when usernames and passwords save like they're supposed to.
[11:02:01] <hlveshorthair> lol
[11:08:34] <Jannertje> hey guys, I'm trying to extract some information from a page that I loaded via ajax. so far I got the html into a variable but I cannot manage to apply selectors to it! anybody that could give me a hand perhaps? (i cant jsfiddle the stuff, it's from a page you have to log in to see; sorry)
[11:09:11] <Eviltwin> You don't want to operate on the HTML, you want to operate on the DOM
[11:09:42] <Jannertje> so i'd want to add this to the dom?
[11:09:52] <Jannertje> maybe append it after the initial html closing tag?
[11:10:23] <NoiseEee> what html are you loading?  presumably new element(s) to be adding to your current document???
[11:10:39] <Eviltwin> The common hack is to do var tree = $("<div>").append(randomHtml);
[11:10:49] <Eviltwin> Then tree.find("#foo .bar") etc
[11:11:03] <ZeroBeholder> brettster, http://jsfiddle.net/6yguJ/10/ --doesn't work, but it is closer
[11:11:08] <Jannertje> Eviltwin: perhaps $("div")?
[11:11:17] <Eviltwin> Jannertje: No
[11:11:22] <Eviltwin> $("<div>")
[11:11:30] <Jannertje> in that case i dont know that syntax
[11:11:34] <Eviltwin> It constructs a new DIV element
[11:11:39] <Jannertje> oh righto
[11:11:44] <Eviltwin> And it'll be in a separate document fragment
[11:11:54] <Jannertje> sweet, let me try that.. i'll get back to you
[11:11:55] <Eviltwin> So you don't need to worry about it screwing with your DOM
[11:12:04] <Jannertje> yeah exactly because that was my initial fear
[11:13:48] <Eviltwin> And that's why we do is this way :)
[11:14:26] <d3f4ultr0> hey folks, quick question but may not related to jquery. We were provided a login api. The layout is already prepared, we just call it. We were told that it's not possible to update the form design/layout. Are there workarounds for this?
[11:15:09] <Eviltwin> d3f4ultr0: Try being less vague
[11:15:26] <Eviltwin> I can't even tell what you're asking for a workaround for
[11:15:27] <hlveshorthair> Legally? I doubt there are workarounds
[11:15:28] <hlveshorthair> but uh
[11:15:38] <d3f4ultr0> i mean, changing the design on the fly?
[11:15:44] <hlveshorthair> If legalities aren't an issue? Look at the JS and reverse engineer
[11:15:48] <Eviltwin> Changing the design without changing the source?
[11:15:48] <d3f4ultr0> like changing the logo
[11:16:08] <d3f4ultr0> somewhat
[11:16:22] <d3f4ultr0> like overlaying our image or adding an image
[11:16:36] <d3f4ultr0> api is from another group
[11:16:37] <Eviltwin> If you cannot alter the HTML or at least one of the JavaScript files, you are out of luck
[11:16:48] <d3f4ultr0> ok, so it's true then
[11:16:58] <NoiseEee> well what does 'api' mean to you d3f4ultr0?
[11:17:09] <NoiseEee> are they providing a login screen that your thingy links to?
[11:17:13] <d3f4ultr0> yes
[11:17:23] <d3f4ultr0> then they just return true or false
[11:17:31] <Eviltwin> Um...
[11:17:42] <NoiseEee> if its their login screen on their domain, no you cannot alter it
[11:17:50] <NoiseEee> but im not sure you're using the term API correctly and its confusing folks
[11:18:08] <d3f4ultr0> i was playing with firebug and then updating the images to point to my other images :)
[11:18:20] <Eviltwin> Does this use an <iframe>?
[11:18:25] <d3f4ultr0> yes, iframe
[11:18:27] <Jannertje> haha
[11:18:39] <Eviltwin> Is the <iframe> from the same origin?
[11:18:48] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, ok, I made a better example. http://jsbin.com/ulenoq I want to achieve that if you clik one square it turns green, if you  click on the other square the first one fades out, changes color, fades in.  With the current code the div doesn't fadein...
[11:18:51] <d3f4ultr0> same origin?
[11:18:55] <Eviltwin> The protocol, domain, and port exactly match?
[11:19:06] <d3f4ultr0> I'll have to look at it again
[11:19:07] <Eviltwin> {proto}://{domain}:{port}/...
[11:19:13] <Jannertje> is it from the same website
[11:19:13] <d3f4ultr0> one sec
[11:19:14] <Jannertje> the iframe
[11:19:43] <d3f4ultr0> i'm sure, it will be from the same major domain since it's our company
[11:19:55] <cirenyc> How can I trigger pressing enter in a text input?  I've tried $('input_selector').trigger('keyPress', [13]) which doesn't error but doesn't seem to be triggering the enter key.
[11:21:06] <Eviltwin> cirenyc: Try looking at this: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[11:21:10] <johnkpaul> cirenyc: you need to create  new Event object and pass that as the second parameter
[11:25:02] <cirenyc> Eviltwin johnkpaul - Okay, thanks.  Looked at that.  I have var e = jQuery.Event("keypress", { keyCode: 13 }); and the $('input_selector').trigger(e); but still nothing.
[11:25:08] <cirenyc> I'll keep reading over the examples/docs.
[11:25:40] <Eviltwin> cirenyc: How is the keypress listener attached?
[11:25:43] <Eviltwin> Does it use jQuery?
[11:25:45] <ajpiano> i don't think you can get a real "enter" behaviour unless you use createEvent, etc
[11:26:06] <mib_mib> hi guys, i'm using jquery ui autocomplete widget in a non-jquery modal popup (of my own doing) - there is a display issue that the autocompleted suggestions dont show up beneath the input text box, very similar to this: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-jquery-autocomplete-in-modal-dialog-using-modalpopupextender-from-ajaxcontroltoolkit except that setting position:relative isn't solving my problem - i know its involved but can som
[11:26:15] <cirenyc> Eviltwin I'm not sure what you mean.
[11:26:28] <Eviltwin> cirenyc: Then you probably need to use createEvent :P
[11:28:35] <cirenyc> Eviltwin: Is that documented somewhere?  Not getting any hits back on my search for official jQuery docs.
[11:28:38] <larzen-wrk2> question, how come after I insert an <option> into my <select> the .change event no longer fires when that option is selected.
[11:29:04] <Eviltwin> cirenyc: That's because it's not jQuery
[11:29:16] <Eviltwin> cirenyc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.createEvent
[11:29:51] <aqqqq> Eviltwin,can you, please, help me out?
[11:30:03] <larzen-wrk2> anyone?
[11:30:15] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: How about in the JavaScript source, you include a comment describing the expected behavior
[11:30:16] <ZeroBeholder> http://jsfiddle.net/6yguJ/17/ -- this is so simple, why doesn't it work? Bah.
[11:30:19] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: And repost
[11:30:27] <cirenyc> k, thanks.
[11:30:41] <Eviltwin> ZeroBeholder: You do know $('#swapper').attr('class', 'menulink') is a setter, right?
[11:30:49] <Eviltwin> i.e. should not be used in an if
[11:30:51] <ZeroBeholder> I don't even think brett is here
[11:31:09] <Eviltwin> You're probably looking for see ?hasClass
[11:31:10] <bot-t> .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[11:31:29] <ZeroBeholder> I tried prop. you are right has class is the right way.
[11:31:49] <Eviltwin> Do you understand what setters and getters are?
[11:32:00] <ZeroBeholder> I don't know all the methods yet. I do know the difference between getters and setters. My tool bag is sparse though.
[11:32:18] <ZeroBeholder> I was typing that just as you asked it.
[11:32:33] <ZeroBeholder> .html is both. but attr and prop must not work that way.
[11:33:04] <Eviltwin> .attr("class") is a getter .attr("class", "foobar") is a setter
[11:33:29] <ZeroBeholder> Well, maybe it does.
[11:33:31] <Eviltwin> Setters in jQuery (almost) universally return the jQuery object they were called on
[11:33:40] <Eviltwin> Which is universally truthy
[11:36:41] <mythgarr> I need to pass a big chunk of the DOM from one page to a web service - how can I get a text representation of the DOM to pass in, then load that text into a target DOM?
[11:37:14] <Eviltwin> mythgarr: Why?
[11:37:28] <mythgarr> Long story
[11:37:44] <mythgarr> But to boil it down - I need to render a page as a PDF
[11:37:58] <aberrant> ok - novice question - how do I use .filter() to match an attribute of colidx = pos (where pos is a variable)?
[11:37:59] <Eviltwin> see .html
[11:38:47] <Eviltwin> aberrant: .filter(function(){return $(this).attr("colidx") === pos})
[11:39:03] <Eviltwin> Or if you're confident that pos is just a number
[11:39:13] <aberrant> pos is just a number
[11:39:15] <Eviltwin> .filter("[colidx="+pos+"]")
[11:39:49] <aberrant> holy cow
[11:39:54] <aberrant> that's awesome - thank you
[11:40:36] <mythgarr> Thanks Eviltwin
[11:41:03] <Eviltwin> Note: That will pass a serialized form of the nodes with their attributes only
[11:41:12] <Eviltwin> Properties, event listeners, etc will not be passed
[11:41:26] <Eviltwin> But since you're just trying to render a PDF
[11:41:33] <Eviltwin> You're probably fine
[11:43:24] <ZeroBeholder> The thing that was probably screwing me up was that I was setting the background property wrong. If you see brettster, it works http://jsfiddle.net/6yguJ/24/
[11:44:16] <Eviltwin> I still suggest this: http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[11:44:26] <ZeroBeholder> *it works for newer versions of jQuery it has the .on and .prop stuff
[11:46:06] <ZeroBeholder> Eviltwin, you may be correct. But, I think all of the toggle stuff has to happen in the callback as hide and unhide aren't useful to this. I will look into it while waiting for my wife to get ready, bored on my workbreak, and/or waiting in doctors office etc.
[11:46:17] <ZeroBeholder> Just not in my bag of tricks at the moment.
[11:47:07] <ZeroBeholder> Hey, that documentation is different than the one I just googled.
[11:47:11] <ZeroBeholder> What gives?
[11:47:26] <aqqqq> Eviltwin this should be understandable :) http://jsbin.com/awujah/2  The problem is that the squares don't fade back in
[11:49:05] <ZeroBeholder> Note: jQuery also provides an animation method named .toggle() that toggles the visibility of elements. Whether the animation or the event method is fired depends on the set of arguments passed.
[11:49:22] <ZeroBeholder> Well that seems like an unhappy coincidence.
[11:50:09] <ZeroBeholder> Off to boring meetings, you all have a good day.
[11:51:52] <brettster> http://pastie.org/4027016 - could someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong. I have an image map - and in the imagemap one of the links is the .menulink class - then there is an image tag with the #bg ID. The .menulink class swaps the image src.
[11:51:56] <brettster> I need it to swap back
[11:51:59] <brettster> this works
[11:52:07] <brettster> but it swaps the image - swaps back
[11:52:10] <brettster> then stops working
[11:55:24] <NaOH> it would be awesome if i could make a <ul> such that when an <li> is removed, the list adjusts with an animation. is there any way to easily achieve this?
[11:56:50] <NaOH> actually, just found this! never mind! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2557602/animating-the-li-removal-in-jquery
[12:03:40] <nonotza> I'm trying to get the value of an input based on the form id and the class of the input. is there a way to do this in one line?
[12:04:34] <nonotza> I tried something like this, but it doesn't seem to work: $('#video_form').find("input.id").val()
[12:04:43] <NaOH> $('form#something input.something).value();
[12:04:47] <NaOH> why won't that work?
[12:04:54] <NaOH> .val() i mean
[12:04:56] <nonotza> I'll try that
[12:04:59] <LessSeen> jej
[12:05:22] <aqqqq> Can anyone please tell why the elements don't fade back in? http://jsbin.com/awujah/2 try to click on one of the squares, it should turn into green, then click onto another red square, and the green square should fade out, turn bck to red, and fade in, but instead of that it just fades out..
[12:05:41] <nonotza> says it's undefined ..
[12:06:07] <NaOH> nonotza: jsfiddle?
[12:06:12] <nonotza> k
[12:07:44] <nonotza> NaOH: http://jsfiddle.net/
[12:07:46] <nonotza> oops
[12:08:09] <nonotza> http://jsfiddle.net/ubWAE/1/
[12:08:13] <nonotza> it works on the jsfiddle
[12:08:16] <nonotza> in isolation
[12:08:25] <nonotza> but it doesn't work in my code
[12:08:30] <nonotza> but I think I know why now
[12:08:41] <NaOH> super
[12:08:50] <nonotza> I might have a form in a form … let me check if that's the case
[12:08:52] <nonotza> thanks for the help
[12:09:00] <NaOH> no problem
[12:09:57] <nonotza> hmm
[12:10:03] <nonotza> it was inside of another form
[12:10:12] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: http://jsbin.com/awujah/3
[12:10:15] <nonotza> I fixed it
[12:10:20] <nonotza> but it still returns undefined
[12:11:26] <NaOH> nonotza: expand the jsfiddle to include more of your code until it breaks or post a link to the problem page
[12:11:42] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, you just added, var selected = $("#proj"+selectedId);? hm that's wierd, though that I tried that already, thanks! :)
[12:12:35] <Eviltwin> There's a deeper reason for why it works now and didn't work before but it takes a while to explain and I don't have the time right now
[12:12:37] <nonotza> got it - thanks again NaOH!
[12:13:39] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, anyways, thank you!
[12:17:02] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, could you maybe explaint what to google, to read about this a bit more?
[12:17:47] <Eviltwin> I'm going to point you here: http://jsfiddle.net/uNWqW/
[12:17:57] <diverdude> if one element is fixed and the other is absolute, are they in the same stacking context?
[12:18:08] <lancealtar> Hi folks! I'm trying to prevent jQuery UI Accordion from changing on click. I've tried using 'changestart' method to return false, but it is not having the desired effect. How would I go about preventing the change to occur? I'm using jQuery 1.7.1 in combination with jQuery UI 1.8.18.
[12:18:16] <lucaswelander> How can i check if $(this).text contains a specific character?
[12:18:28] <Eviltwin> lucaswelander: Use JavaScript's indexOF?
[12:18:32] <Eviltwin> indexOf*
[12:20:51] <Eviltwin> aqqqq: Or for the non-power user: http://jsfiddle.net/uNWqW/1/
[12:21:14] <Eviltwin> The letters correspond to the order the code is run in
[12:21:33] <Eviltwin> Notice that it isn't top-to-bottom
[12:21:47] <lucaswelander> Eviltwin: tyvm :)
[12:21:53] <Eviltwin> This is because of the callback functions and the asynchronous nature of the code
[12:22:04] <kba> I've outlined a problem with jQuery and zClip at http://derfor.dk/jquery/ if somebody would please take a look at it. I've completely isolated the problem, but can't figure out what's causing it.
[12:22:35] <aqqqq> Eviltwin, thanks! :) So the way how the functions are being stacked up!
[12:23:41] <Eviltwin> The problem with your code was you had something like: var x = "#foo"; $(x).fadeOut(function() { $(x).fadeIn(); }); x = "#bar";
[12:23:55] <Eviltwin> That actually runs var x = "#foo"
[12:24:02] <Eviltwin> Then $(x).fadeOut starts the animation
[12:24:08] <Eviltwin> Then x gets set to "#bar"
[12:24:14] <Eviltwin> Then $(x).fadeIn(); runs
[12:24:19] <Eviltwin> At which point x is already "#bar"
[12:24:25] <Eviltwin> So it refers to a different element
[12:24:47] <Eviltwin> My solution was to do var x = "#foo"; var y = $(x); y.fadeOut(function() { y.fadeIn(); }); x = "#bar";
[12:25:01] <Eviltwin> At which point it doesn't matter whether x is changed or not
[12:27:22] <buremba> is there any way to do something like that http://i.imgur.com/9d9DQ.jpg ? I can only get character order of the cursor, but in I couldn't that information in a pixel value.
[12:28:09] <Guest312> quit
[12:31:07] <lancealtar> Is there a way to prevent the change event from firing when using Accordion?
[12:33:32] <shoky> why would you want it not to fire
[12:34:39] <diverdude> how can i make sure that all elements implementing .ui-autocomplete, which are already added and will be added in the future will have a z-index of of 4000?
[12:35:08] <diverdude> ps. i cannot modify the .ui-autocomplete class
[12:36:21] <lucaswelander> could anyone help me out here: http://pastie.org/4027222 ? the first if works as intended, if there already is a { then it doesnt prepends another one. but the second if is not. it isnt removing the initial } and that.append() doesnt get fired, anyone got any idea why?
[12:37:30] <ajpiano> lucaswelander: the second one only replaces in memory, not in the dom
[12:38:47] <lucaswelander> how do i remove it in the dom?
[12:40:13] <ajpiano> lucaswelander: you have to call .text or .html or whatever
[12:40:15] <shoky> also that toString() will just give you "[object Object]" or something. also are you sure you're properly checking the return value of indexOf ?
[12:45:12] <kba> If anybody could please have a look at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10887159/zclip-not-working-when-using-ajax I'd appreciate it
[12:47:23] <lucaswelander> ajpiano: where should i call .text? before .replace?
[12:47:27] <shoky> kba: your addTableRow function is wrong
[12:47:47] <shoky> kba: $('#accounts tbody').append($('<tr>')  <-- this returns the 'tbody' elemtn
[12:47:48] <shoky> element
[12:48:13] <ajpiano> lucaswelander: you would either pass the result of your replace to .text
[12:49:22] <kba> shoky: $('<tr>') is the new tr element. I then add to that element, and finally add it all to tbody
[12:49:36] <ajpiano> or you could do that.text(fuction(i, text) { if (text.indexOf("}") > -1) { return text.replace("}", ""); } else { return text; } });
[12:49:45] <shoky> kba: ah right, sorry
[12:49:46] <kba> if I had said $('#accounts tbody').append($('<tr>')).append($('<td>')) you were right
[12:49:48] <Eviltwin> Anyone have a link handy for that article about browsers & small setTimeout values
[12:49:53] <Eviltwin> How they don't actually get respected
[12:52:15] <ajpiano> Eviltwin: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2011/12/14/timer-resolution-in-browsers/ http://ejohn.org/blog/accuracy-of-javascript-time/ ?
[12:52:51] <rroelofs> kba: according to the docs if you define a function for the copy it will get run so you can specify what to put in the clipboard
[12:53:42] <shoky> kba: it works for me on both pages..
[12:54:06] <kba> shoky: what browser?
[12:54:17] <shoky> chrome 21
[12:54:21] <kba> OSX?
[12:54:24] <shoky> win7
[12:54:30] <kba> that might be it
[12:54:34] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Thanks
[12:56:45] <shoky> kba: btw you tagged your SO question 'zlip'
[12:57:05] <kba> shoky: thanks, fixed
[12:58:22] <rvsjoen_> jQuery("form.filter select").on("change", function(){ console.log("Foobar"); }); <-- any clues why that doesn't work ?
[12:58:49] <kba> shoky: but you're talking about http://derfor.dk/jquery right? Thoise two examples both work with a popup and puts 'Here we go.' in clipboard?
[12:59:17] <NoiseEee> rvsjoen_: is your selector correct?
[13:00:01] <rvsjoen_> it works if I wrap it in jQuery(document).ready() and leave out the call to on()
[13:00:48] <rvsjoen_> I might have interpreted the docs wrong, but I thought on() was replacing live(), which means it'll attach the event handlers when the DOM becomes ready
[13:02:49] <diverdude> ajpiano: how can i make sure that all elements implementing .ui-autocomplete, which are already added and will be added in the future will have a z-index of of 4000?
[13:02:51] <johnkpaul> rvsjoen_: on is replacing live, but it's not a drop in replacement
[13:03:34] <shoky> kba: weird... it stopped working :) i'm positive it worked before on both pages (and yes i reset my clipboard content each time)
[13:03:48] <rvsjoen_> alright
[13:03:51] <johnkpaul> rvsjoen_: https://gist.github.com/1749717
[13:04:04] <rvsjoen_> thanks
[13:04:26] <shoky> kba: and now i reset chrome and it worked again
[13:05:15] <diverdude> how can i make sure that all elements implementing .ui-autocomplete, which are already added and will be added in the future will have a z-index of of 4000?
[13:05:46] <shoky> kba: but it's because sometimes i'm able to click the flash , and other times i'm only able to click the button element
[13:05:48] <kba> shoky: mysterious
[13:06:01] <shoky> er
[13:06:03] <shoky> no thats not it sry
[13:07:15] <shoky> kba: on some parts of the button it works, other parts it doesnt :)
[13:07:40] <shoky> kba: when the cursor turns into a hand pointer, and then i click, it works. when the cursor stays default, it doesn't work.
[13:07:53] <shoky> it's some issue with the flash placement on the button, no idea.
[13:08:02] <shoky> gtg
[13:09:13] <diverdude> can i use on() to detect if elements are added?
[13:09:54] <piker32> diverdude: yes
[13:10:06] <diverdude> piker32: what do i then specify as event?
[13:10:13] <NoiseEee> o.O
[13:10:15] <piker32> i _believe_ "load"
[13:10:39] <NoiseEee> piker32 / diverdude: no, there is no event that fires when a new element has appeared in the DOM.
[13:10:45] <diverdude> i mean...i just want to add a z-index to the element if it is added
[13:11:03] <piker32> knew i should have googled
[13:11:38] <piker32> sorry, yea thats ajax requests
[13:11:42] <diverdude> NoiseEee: is there any other way then to add z-index to elements which implements a specific class?
[13:13:16] <piker32> is there a reason it can't being in the CSS?
[13:13:33] <piker32> be in*
[13:21:14] <fdv> anybody familiar with the validation plugin here now who can have a glance at http://jsfiddle.net/JXUZb/1/ ? I need the two fields to have different ranges, is this the wrong way to accomplish that?
[13:24:04] <MeXTuX> Is it a good practice to place <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script> at the bottom? Speaking in terms of web site performance,
[13:24:21] <johnkpaul> MeXTuX: yes
[13:24:24] <MeXTuX> at the bottom of html file inside the body

[13:32:37] <Vivid> see here, it nearly works but adds in an extra slide, also doesn't loop back to first, jumping to second instead...
[13:32:37] <Vivid> http://provecta.uk.com/dev.php#
[13:32:44] <chanandler_bong> when I add a row, how can I get jquery to re-evaluate adding datepickers to date fields?

[13:42:31] <ckoning> $(this).bind('error',handleError)
[13:42:44] <ckoning> and then in handleError(event) {}
[13:42:56] <ckoning> .... event.msg or some such ...
[13:43:39] <Vivid> vladikoff: any ideas? it's going one extra and not returning to the first slide
[13:53:46] <game16> Hi
[13:54:00] <Vivid> borked slider, anyone know how to fix? http://provecta.uk.com/dev.php#
[13:55:29] <LessSeen> Vivid: make a jsfiddle
[13:56:10] <catcher> Vivid, if(currentPosition+1 == numberOfSlides)
[13:57:51] <Vivid> catcher:yes. looks like that sorted it
[13:58:10] <Vivid> had to change another part too but it's good now
[13:58:48] <catcher> Vivid, glad to hear it.
[13:59:04] <Vivid> thanks a lot :o)
[13:59:19] <catcher> np :)
[14:00:07] <venus_> hello, how can i insert a value to an input box through jquery ?
[14:00:14] <Eviltwin> see ?.val
[14:00:15] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[14:08:37] <poppiez> why isn't the $.animate duration precise? if I tell it 400 ms, it takes around 380 ms
[14:09:04] <poppiez> I understand it can be slower, but not faster
[14:12:23] <sayd> does anyone have that url handy where some guy was demonstrating some new ide's he was working on that had realtime compilation (not lighttable) also had a game he built and some circuit design app
[14:19:53] <zanberdo> I'm using jQuery UI tabs and have linked each tab to a specific URL. I need to be able to pass the value of an input field as data toe the ajaxOptions.  If I seed the value of the input field the ajax call works as expected (passing the seeded value) but if I change the value of the input field the next successive ajax call fails to grab the new data. Is the tabs object cached such that it ignores changes to the data options?
[14:20:10] <zanberdo> or am I just being particularly dense?
[14:21:12] <Gavilan> is there any way to bind a click event to all the elements of a class, and then if I modify the DOM and add new elements of that class, have them have the same binding?
[14:23:47] <NoiseEee> Gavilan: $('#parentElementID'
[14:24:10] <NoiseEee> Gavilan: $('#parentElementID').on('click','.className',function() { // everything with that class underneath the parent, present and future, will fire! }
[14:24:49] <Gavilan> NoiseEee: Great! that's exactly what I wanted!
[14:25:16] <Gavilan> underneath means directly? or children of children of children work too?
[14:29:02] <ShaunR> is there a way to do this? $(this).parent().parent().('.modal-body').html('test');
[14:30:05] <NoiseEee> Gavilan: well, JS events bubble, so children of children would work.
[14:30:26] <NoiseEee> ShaunR: uhhhh sure, do it!
[14:31:03] <ShaunR> it doesnt work.
[14:32:15] <NoiseEee> i would suspect it highly depends on what you think "this" is
[14:34:16] <shoky> ShaunR: that .('.modal-body') looks highly suspicious
[14:34:38] <brylie> Can you have multiple listeners attached to the same element? E.g. $('#element').change(functionOne); $('#element').change(functionTwo);
[14:34:45] <shoky> brylie: yep
[14:34:55] <brylie> OK, thanks shoky :)

[14:37:26] <Gavilan> NoiseEee: Great!
[14:46:18] <zanberdo> I'm using the Tabs UI as: $(function() { $( '#tabs').tabs({ ajaxOptions: { data: { nd: new Data().getTime() } } }); When I trace the call I expect nd to change each time I click a different tab, but it appears to remain static. Is there a way to force the tabs object to refresh the data object?
[14:52:29] <shoky> zanberdo: you'd have to do something like  $('#tabs').tabs('option', { ajaxOptions: { data: someNewData } });
[14:52:46] <shoky> each time a tab is selected
[14:53:55] <zanberdo> shoky, this is how mine is presently defined: http://pastebin.com/XdghvC76
[14:55:18] <zanberdo> when I observe the GET transaction I can clearly see that the cache option added a '_' parameter which changes each and every call (as expected) but my own identifier does not...
[14:57:08] <shoky> zanberdo: then as i said, you need something like this:  http://pastebin.com/vwAFfwbJ
[14:58:15] <zanberdo> shoky, you pasted example is clear. let me give that a whirl
[14:58:30] <shoky> maybe you'd also need to put the cache & error options again in the select callback, i donno
[15:02:45] <jenia> hi everyone
[15:03:19] <jenia> after i remove an element from dom, and re-insert it else where, the callback functions registered with that element do not get called
[15:03:24] <jenia> how can i solve this?
[15:03:35] <shoky> jenia:  use .detach() instead of .remove()
[15:03:40] <jenia> ah thanks
[15:05:14] <MacroMan> Is there something I can check on to see if I have already called .draggable() on an object yet?
[15:06:09] <shoky> MacroMan: you can check for whatever class is added to the element. ui-draggable or smth
[15:06:15] <zanberdo> shoky, thanks again. still not working but I'm making some progress. I can confirm $('#identifier').val() with a simple alert in the select function.  Sadly however the parameters to not reflect the same value. It's as though the tabs data object is not grabbing the new value...
[15:06:20] <crazyzf> hi, why the hack ist that not working?
[15:06:22] <crazyzf> http://jsfiddle.net/6gZn4/
[15:06:47] <shoky> crazyzf: check your console
[15:07:20] <crazyzf> shoky: which console u mean?
[15:07:21] <MacroMan> shoky: Thanks. If I call it again after it's been called, will it do some of the work twice (eg calling events twice)?
[15:07:39] <shoky> crazyzf: the javascript console in your browser
[15:08:02] <shoky> MacroMan: i donno but i doubt it
[15:08:05] <MacroMan> I seem to be having problems with calling the function over and over again with it getting slower and slower, despite me calling destroy in between
[15:08:22] <crazyzf> oh thanks, i didn´t know that it work in jsfiddler
[15:08:22] <shoky> jsfiddle would help
[15:08:40] <shoky> crazyzf: your browser is the one running the javascript code
[15:09:25] <crazyzf> yea sometimes im to stupid to think
[15:09:54] <shoky> interesting
[15:09:56] <MacroMan> It takes a little looking at to get your head around. This function binds the dragstop and resizestop events and calls itself if they fire. Each time it calls itself, my browser gets slower and slower: http://pastebin.com/FhvrP8WS
[15:10:16] <chovy> when using $.post('/foo', { a: 'a1' }, fn); how do I pass multiple values for one key?

[15:18:13] <FrozenFire> Is there an event that I can bind such that when a new element with a particular class is added to the DOM, a function fires?
[15:18:44] <crazyzf> FrozenFire : use on() or live()
[15:19:14] <MacroMan> live() is depreciated. Use on()
[15:19:36] <crazyzf> yes
[15:19:40] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, Yeah, but what event am I binding?
[15:19:47] <chovy> shoky: i want to get them as an array.
[15:19:57] <chovy> a => 1 & a => 2
[15:20:06] <crazyzf> which event u need?
[15:20:06] <jenia> i'm creating an element dynamically. in fact its a class of elements that im creating
[15:20:08] <chovy> in php i will get $_GET['a']
[15:20:13] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, Added to DOM
[15:20:14] <chovy> I want it to be an array.
[15:20:35] <FrozenFire> Basically, I have a function which takes <div class="foo"></div> and does something with it.
[15:20:44] <jenia> and i want to registera call back for that class. but ofcourse, when i do $(document).ready
[15:20:48] <FrozenFire> When new .foo:empty elements are added, I need to process them
[15:20:53] <jenia> the element does not exist yet
[15:20:58] <crazyzf> good question, maybe load?
[15:21:16] <jenia> is there any simple way that i can tell jquery to register a call back for an element as soon as it appear in the dom?
[15:21:30] <MacroMan> jenia: Use on()
[15:21:41] <jenia> ahh okay thanks
[15:21:56] <mythgarr_> Is there an easy way for me to take the contents of the first iframe and set them to the entire document?
[15:22:05] <cybersholt> hello anybody here can help with $.offset & Tipsy its getting wrong position on cloned elements : http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/7Mhhc/ Thanks
[15:23:43] <jenia> actually it was live()
[15:23:55] <jenia> but thanks, you led me right there
[15:23:59] <jenia> ;)
[15:24:38] <FrozenFire> jenia, Apparently live() is deprecated
[15:24:53] <FrozenFire> MacroMan, As of what version is live() deprecated, do you know?
[15:25:10] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks...
[15:25:12] <MacroMan> FrozenFire: 1.7
[15:25:21] <sunbeam> with this url, http://img.youtube.com/vi/lvXk3J7jx1/0.jpg - how do i get the part between vi/ and /0.jpg?
[15:25:23] <jonathancutrell> what's the common way to make :target work in browsers that don't support it?
[15:25:25] <MacroMan> FrozenFire: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[15:25:33] <jenia> oh no!! damn
[15:25:39] <jonathancutrell> I know there is a good polyfill based on adding classes or something similar...
[15:25:43] <crazyzf> FrozenFire: i think u have to find another solution...what u fire before the dom change?
[15:25:57] <jonathancutrell> But I want to support native :target pseudo if it exists.
[15:26:09] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, I need it to hook any new elements. I cannot involve the function which creates the element.
[15:26:19] <cybersholt> last call anybody here can help with $.offset its getting wrong position on cloned elements : http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/7Mhhc/ Thanks
[15:26:44] <crazyzf> FrozenFire: how u get the data? over ajax?
[15:27:20] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, Doesn't matter. I'm creating an application which others will extend. I need to hook when the element is created.
[15:27:23] <MacroMan> jenia: Although live() will work for now, it does have some problems and will be removed in the next version of jquery. on() is capable of everything that live() is, so you shouldn't have much trouble using it
[15:27:40] <jenia> thanks
[15:28:53] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, Essentially, what the elements represent is a configuration for a video to be displayed via our CDN. The CDN provides a script which automatically handles the initialization of the video or flash element.
[15:29:02] <FrozenFire> I need to pass the CDN's script the configuration.
[15:29:02] <Acrack> hello
[15:29:10] <FrozenFire> The elements may be created in any number of ways.
[15:29:19] <FrozenFire> Might be via AJAX, might be by the user, etc.
[15:29:51] <jenia> i have $("button").on("click,function(){    });
[15:30:00] <jenia> and it does not work
[15:30:08] <jenia> (i closed the quote in my code)
[15:30:10] <crazyzf> FrozenFire: maybe with find('yourClass') != -1 and on() but u have to try i dont know if it will work
[15:30:30] <jenia> but if i change it the function "on" to "live" then it does work
[15:30:35] <jenia> what am i doing wrong?
[15:30:48] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, The question isn't how to select the element. The question is how to detect when it's created.
[15:31:05] <MacroMan> jenia: You may need to reference a parent in the on() to get it to work. eg $('#parent').on('click', '#button', fucntion(){
[15:31:10] <FrozenFire> If I have to bind every DOM modification, that'll be resource-intensive.
[15:31:17] <crazyzf> jenia:
[15:31:19] <crazyzf> $(document).on('event', 'class', function(){});
[15:31:40] <MacroMan> jenia: Or as crazyzf says, bind it to document
[15:32:10] <Acrack> hello line 15 http://www.pastie.org/4027929 of this paste, i receiving an array of nickNames, i need to put them in data-source on the form thingy
[15:32:15] <Acrack> am i doing it right ?
[15:32:21] <Acrack> cause its not working :p
[15:32:23] <crazyzf> FrozenFire: with find() u can detect it
[15:32:31] <jenia> thanks very much
[15:32:35] <crazyzf> is it not there it will be return -1
[15:32:38] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, With find() I can find it.
[15:32:41] <jenia> it worked (i did like crazyzf said)
[15:32:41] <FrozenFire> But that is not the point.
[15:32:55] <FrozenFire> The point of events is to detect when an event occurs.
[15:33:12] <FrozenFire> The event I want to detect is the creation of a DOM node with the class "foo" which is empty.
[15:33:19] <crazyzf> i know the point but i don´t think u can do it with jquery maybe with javascript
[15:33:32] <FrozenFire> jQuery just wraps Javascript.
[15:33:43] <FrozenFire> If there isn't a jQuery event, there's not likely to be any Javascript event.
[15:33:53] <FrozenFire> crazyzf, I'll accept "I don't know"
[15:34:02] <FrozenFire> In fact, I'd prefer it over speculation :P
[15:34:56] <crazyzf> i sayd before i don´t know and that u can try it by combinating on(find())
[15:35:10] * FrozenFire sighs
[15:35:50] <catcher> FrozenFire, I think the livequery plug may solve it for you.  It's not super efficient, but prob better than polling every x sec.
[15:35:55] <sunbeam> jQuery('.youtube-thumbs li a').click(function() { alert(jQuery(this).closest('img').attr('src')); });
[15:35:59] <sunbeam> any diea what i do wrong here?
[15:36:02] <sunbeam> idea*
[15:36:03] <catcher> FrozenFire, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[15:36:05] <sunbeam> i get undefined
[15:36:18] <FrozenFire> catcher, Ouch
[15:36:26] <FrozenFire> That's a good indication that this is going to be non-trivial. :P
[15:36:35] <ragnok> undefined === var is not defined
[15:36:49] <catcher> haha
[15:36:50] <ragnok> out of scope maybe
[15:36:55] <FrozenFire> Might end up just setting an interval
[15:36:56] <sunbeam> ragnok: ok but the img src does exist
[15:37:08] <sunbeam> ragnok: any suggestion what i should use?
[15:37:10] <sunbeam> its the
[15:37:17] <sunbeam> '.youtube-thumbs li a img' src i want t get
[15:38:49] <Acrack> can somebody tell me how to change data stuff ? like i have data-source = "toto" i want it to be data-source = "bobo"
[15:38:52] <Acrack> how to do it ?
[15:39:22] <Acrack> is it like this : 'bobo' = $this.data('source');
[15:39:23] <Acrack> ?
[15:40:22] <LessSeen> .attr("data-source": "bobo") ?
[15:40:39] <LessSeen> meh u get teh idea
[15:41:13] <crazyzf> FrozenFire: http://jsfiddle.net/eQErD/1/
[15:43:09] <Acrack> LessSeen : missing ) after argument list
[15:43:09] <Acrack> $('#getString').attr("data-source": "bobo");
[15:43:22] <sunbeam> anyone maybe knows what i should fix?
[15:43:22] <Acrack> am i doing it wrong ?
[15:43:28] <sunbeam> '.youtube-thumbs li a img' its src i want t get
[15:43:33] <sunbeam> jQuery('.youtube-thumbs li a').click(function() { alert(jQuery(this).closest('img').attr('src')); });
[15:43:36] <sunbeam> thats what i use now

[15:55:03] <LindsayMac> I swear I'm not entirely stupid.. I can do some fun stuff with php, css, and html.. I just dont know a thing about js
[15:55:33] <mib_mib> mythgarr_: workarounds? dont use an iframe, use jsonp potentially..
[15:55:43] <tw2113> :)
[15:59:33] <mythgarr_> mib_mib: Doesnt look like JSONP would allow me to retrieve HTML or XML, though - good thought
[16:07:20] <fdv> this is weird. with the validation plugin, after $('#first').rules('add', {min: 1}); $('#second').rules('add', {min: 2});, both #first and #second will have a min value of 2, but if done using attr - $('#first').attr('min', 1); $('#second').attr('min', 2);, #first has a min value of 1 and #second a min value of 2. This must be a bug?
[16:08:44] <fdv> afaics from the test cases, this isn't tested in the test cases, but I can't understand that it hasn't popped up somewhere...
[16:20:24] <jonathancutrell> Hey folks.
[16:20:45] <jonathancutrell> Anyone have any idea what the deal is with scaling inline SVG's in webkit? It looks like the height is calculated incorrectly.
[16:23:16] <crazyzf> how can i check if a textarea is selected?
[16:26:52] <albert`> i would like to replace some css-properties if they exist. basically something like 's/property: foo/property: bar/'.. is that possible without providing a selector?
[16:28:56] <albert`> of course i could use the selector * but that would set said property even if there was no such property defined in the first place
[16:29:26] <LessSeen> maybe something like this?  $("[property=foo]").attr("property", "bar");
[16:30:04] <Whirl3d> use .prop
[16:31:09] <crazyzf> how can i check if a textarea is selected?
[16:31:40] <albert`> LessSeen: is property=foo valid in case of css-properties?
[16:31:44] <Whirl3d> $("textarea').is (":focus") >
[16:33:59] <albert`> or lets just rephrase:  I'd like to make all alements that have the css-property `fixed' or `absolute' into `static'. thats what i'm trying to do for hours now.. and it works.. but it only works when i use a selector.. which in turn will apply this css-property to every single element.. :)
[16:34:01] <crazyzf> thank u
[16:34:51] <albert`> Whirl3d: whats the difference between .attr and .prop?
[16:35:24] <shoky> albert`: http://timmywillison.com/2011/When-to-use-.attr()-and-.prop().html
[16:35:37] <Whirl3d> attr, afaict, are set in markup, whereas the state of the element is deteremined by prop....I think

[16:40:06] <kryl> so easy sry :)
[16:40:18] <javaninja> actually....one sec just to gain more knowledge on whats happening gimme a sec

[16:40:44] <kryl> and I need to remove all fields name that begins with "wp_.*" ... do I need to use javascript regexp or is there any shortest way with jquery functs ?
[16:41:33] <kryl> huntedmitch, :)
[16:43:34] <shoky> kryl: $(':input').not('[name^="wp_."]').each(...

[16:46:17] <crazyzf> how can i use the hover-event with on() ? like this $("#demo1 li").hover( makeTall, makeShort )
[16:47:49] <javaninja> ok just did some experimenting heres my problem as it lies
[16:47:55] <javaninja> lyes* idk how to spell anyways
[16:47:56] <shoky> crazyzf first line in hover() docs: The .hover() method binds handlers for both mouseenter and mouseleave events.
[16:48:25] <javaninja> I have a div which contains an iframe, my code intercepts the scrolling & changes how scrolling works.  Note: On images this glitch does not occure
[16:48:26] <crazyzf> this is what i want
[16:48:58] <crazyzf> but i don´t know how to write the right syntax with on()
[16:49:00] <javaninja> On videos for whatever reason when I scroll the video is popping to the top of the page, my assumption is that it's going "oh you want me to scroll" and still scrolling.
[16:49:11] <crazyzf> oh i understand lol
[16:49:14] <crazyzf> thanks
[16:49:19] <javaninja> My fix for this originally was to position:fixed;  but now I have a problem cuz users can resize the browser breaking the position of the frame
[16:49:44] <javaninja> how do I make it so that when I scroll, nothing actually scrolls & only my scroll event fires?
[16:50:24] <javaninja> yes that's my question after working this out
[16:50:32] <javaninja> how do I make it so that when I scroll, nothing actually scrolls & only my scroll event fires?
[16:55:12] <shoky> javaninja: dont think you can prevent scrolling, but you could change it back to what it was..
[16:57:44] <chomp> anyone use js-hotkeys?
[16:57:44] <javaninja> shoky i'm trying that right now
[16:57:52] <javaninja> to see if I can intercept & just make it match scrolling.
[16:57:58] <chomp> or could recommend something better?
[17:00:48] <chomp> hmm jkey looks promising
[17:02:01] <brl0> i'm trying to connect draggable and sortable, and I'm not sure how to intercept the 'drop
[17:02:21] <brl0>  'drop' and attach custom markup, and not a copy/clone of the original dragged element
[17:03:20] <kryl> I need to post data from my form to 2 different page :-) I can use ajax for the first one but I want to jump like normal submit to the second one, is it possible with jquery to serialize and post data like normal post (not ajax)

[17:03:57] <Aquilas> Hey guys, I'm having trouble updating a global variable in a jQuery.get callback function
[17:04:01] <Aquilas> Is there anyway to do it?
[17:04:24] <brl0> yes, just refefence directly, or via window['variableName']
[17:04:33] <brl0> refefence, nice
[17:05:03] <Aquilas> Well the direct reference doesnt work, but I'll try window
[17:05:11] <brl0> window.omg = global in the window scope.. same as window['omg']
[17:07:49] <brl0> can you intercept the receive/update/stop events and overwrite the node before sortable changes it's position in the list?
[17:09:17] <javaninja> is there anyway at all to make an absolute positioned element fixed only during scrolling?
[17:09:19] <brl0> beforeStop looks promosing..
[17:09:38] <brl0> i suck
[17:10:09] <chovy> javaninja: you have to use js to change from fixed.
[17:10:12] <Aquilas> Hmm I still cant do this global change
[17:10:14] <Aquilas> http://jsfiddle.net/n3yFt/3/
[17:10:16] <Aquilas> Here's my code
[17:10:23] <chovy> I did this once having a menu that followed you down the page.
[17:10:34] <brl0> javaninja, have you tried $(window).on('scroll', function(e){$(node).css('position', 'fixed')}) type of stuff?
[17:11:00] <javaninja> yeah it's slow & hideous
[17:11:24] <javaninja> honestly it's a scrolling glitch
[17:11:33] <javaninja> that for whatever reason doesn't happen on images, only on video
[17:11:56] <javaninja> i'm using an iframe maybe thats the reason this is happening
[17:12:38] <javaninja> wait I got another question
[17:12:55] <javaninja> is it possible to realign a fixed element the same way relative/absolute elements get realigned during window resize?
[17:13:30] <jwg2s> can anyone help me with a scrollTo issue i'm having?  trying to scroll so that the center of the target div is aligned with the vertical center of the window
[17:13:32] <jwg2s> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10889983/jquery-scrollto-center-div-in-window-vertically
[17:14:45] <javaninja> yeah that's probably my answer, on window resize?
[17:14:50] <javaninja> and then move the fixed element huh?
[17:15:32] <jwg2s> what answer?
[17:15:45] <javaninja> well if my element is fixed it's perfectly fine and there isn't a glitch
[17:15:53] <javaninja> but then when the user resizes browser element does not move
[17:16:08] <shoky> Aquilas: you can't return the data like that right after starting the ajax request. ajax is asynchronous
[17:16:11] <javaninja> so i was thinking "k make element absolute"
[17:16:18] <javaninja> but then I have a glitch during scrolling.
[17:16:20] <kryl> bye all :)
[17:16:24] <Aquilas> damn
[17:16:26] <shoky> ?ajax101 @ Aquilas
[17:16:27] <bot-t> Aquilas, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[17:16:32] <javaninja> so now imma just do on window resize realign the fixed element
[17:16:46] <Aquilas> lol all right thanks
[17:18:23] <jwg2s> anyone have any ideas on my scrollTo issue?
[17:19:14] <javaninja> fingures crossed my code works haha
[17:20:55] <burgiking> any solve my query - Scaling something with animate from 0.4 - 0.6, however it starts at one and decrements down o_O. Works fine for 0.6 -> 1.0, and 1.0 -> 1.5
[17:28:26] <huntedmitch> Hey guys, what's a quick way to unescape html special characters? i.e. &amp; = & etc.
[17:36:51] <ckoning> huntedmitch:
[17:36:58] <ckoning> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1219860/javascript-jquery-html-encoding
[17:40:07] <huntedmitch> ckoning: Cheers, thanks!
[17:40:24] <huntedmitch> ckoning: I know there is another, better solution, which I cannot find. But that seems to be working.
[17:42:14] <chovy> is this valid?
[17:42:20] <chovy> $foo.append(
[17:42:25] <chovy>   '<div>' +
[17:42:33] <chovy>       '</div>'
[17:42:35] <chovy>   );
[17:42:40] <chovy> on two separate lines?
[17:43:17] <huntedmitch> Put a \ at the end of the lines, should fix any errors you're getting
[17:43:26] <ckoning> huntedmitch: There is a problem with urls encoded with '+' for space instead of '%20'
[17:43:29] <chovy> i'm actually not getting any errors
[17:43:38] <huntedmitch> ckoning: Shouldn't be a problem
[17:43:44] <ckoning> (en|de)codeURIComponent doesn't handle that
[17:47:40] <huntedmitch> chovy: Glad to have helped then ;)
[17:47:56] <javaninja> SOLVED!!!
[17:47:58] <javaninja> Guys listen up case anyone has my issue
[17:49:05] <javaninja> IF YOU WANT A FIXED ELEMENT ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN I.E. to MATCHUP WITH OTHER CONTENT, you use $(element).offset();  to gain the Left & Right of the other element on screen, then matchup your fixed object based on that element via $(window).resize(function(){// change fixed element based on offset here});
[17:49:07] * huntedmitch listens
[17:49:18] <chovy> huntedmitch: yeah man :)
[17:49:50] <javaninja> I right now have a fixed object that is working as if it's position:absolute.   Via this current function & it is awesome!
[17:50:03] <javaninja> solves my iframe glitch :-)
[17:53:15] <ryanaz> what's the easiest way to put a nice rounded look to something?   What I basically want is a $('#here').dialog();   except without the title and the close button
[17:54:20] <ryanaz> looks like I see a few things out there called round() .... but they seem somewhat excessive to boot strap in
[18:10:21] <ryanaz> how can you disable a title bar on a dialog() ?
[18:23:09] <soahccc> Hey guys. What is the "best" way of removing the last element from a jquery collection? $(".foo").pop does not work... I only find the .not selector but isn't this a bit to inefficient to just drop the last element?
[18:27:14] <chovy> $(".foo").last().remove()
[18:34:05] <cambazz> how can i check if a variable is defined
[18:39:28] <wookiehangover> cambazz: if its a local variable if( foo === undefined ){ }
[18:39:48] <wookiehangover> if its a global if( typeof foo == "undefined" ){ }
[18:40:19] <wookiehangover> all that and so much moar can be found in idiomatic javascript https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js
[18:42:40] <cambazz> how can i say the first a under div.pbox, and iterate over them
[18:43:00] <cambazz> i did 'div.pbox a:first' but it will only iterate over the first pbox
[18:43:01] <Christer_> Hi guys - Could anyone of you have a look at this: http://jsfiddle.net/gwcK7/ - And tell me why its running a instant infinite loop instead of waiting the 1000 milliseconds before running the function again. normally the variable at the top is set to false, and another function sets it to true when it has performed its task - but since this one is not waiting the 1 second before running the function again to check - its never gets changed
[18:43:01] <Christer_> .
[18:43:06] <eip56> Evening all
[18:43:33] <wookiehangover> cambazz: $('.pbox').children().each(function(){ ... })
[18:43:46] <wookiehangover> ?children
[18:43:46] <bot-t> .children([selector]): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/children/
[18:44:02] <wookiehangover> eip56: whats shakin
[18:49:27] <cambazz> wookiehangover: it is like i have a bunch of pbox'es each with content, and i want to iterate each pbox, and find the first child that is an A, and modify it
[18:50:32] <wookiehangover> $('.pbox').each(function(){ $(this).find('a:first').doStuff(); })
[18:55:44] <cambazz> well, i found a:first, but I could not do the doStuff() part... :) what I need to do is this.href = this.href + '?ref=' + zid;
[18:56:02] <cambazz> and $(this).find('a:first').href will return undefined

[18:56:33] <tman> is there a reliable way to detect client bandwidth?
[18:56:59] <tman> i'd like to toggle a function based on knowing roughly what kind of connection the client is on
[18:57:14] <shoky> nah
[18:58:00] <shoky> well, nothing client-side that is
[18:58:51] <shoky> well also server-side
[18:59:05] <tman> https://github.com/anderssonjohan/Nettest going to test that.
[18:59:52] <cambazz> yes I have done it! :)
[18:59:58] <shoky> uhm that just measures response time
[19:00:07] <shoky> not 'what kind of connection the client is on
[19:00:09] <tman> hmm ya
[19:00:28] <tman> i guess i could let the user pick
[19:00:33] <tman> i just.. i hate splash screens.
[19:00:47] <cambazz> well, another think i need to do is to obsfucate integers in javascripts
[19:03:41] <cambazz> i am googling, but all i get is javascript obsfucation
[19:17:49] <shoky> got an example of what you mean?
[19:34:25] <Whirl3d> what is the focus and blur event when used with .on  i thought it was focusIn and focusOut...
[19:34:44] <Christer_> Anyone got any experience with HighCharts? - I got a problem making the chart display the categories and the data correct- i believe the problem would be somewhere in this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/tyetq/ - but im not sure. The problem is that it only displays the first category, like im just trying to view 1 serie.
[19:35:07] <Whirl3d> guess it's just focus and blur. Not sure why I thought it changed for .on....
[19:43:58] <Whirl3d> do focus and blur bubble?
[19:45:08] <tw2113> only if you stick your straw in and blow for a moment
[19:45:21] <tw2113> aka dunno, but i had to say that
[19:47:50] <friedbyte> how do I add a variable myVar to $(this).addClass(myVar); ?
[19:48:57] <friedbyte> do I need quotes around the variable ?
[19:55:27] <tw2113> shouldn't
[19:55:34] <tw2113> because that'd just turn the text into a string
[19:57:59] <tw2113> friedbyte
[19:58:22] <friedbyte> huh
[19:58:27] <tw2113> read above
[19:58:33] <friedbyte> yeah
[19:59:36] <friedbyte> how would I do that then?
[19:59:53] <tw2113> is $(this).addClass(myVar);  not working?
[20:00:32] <friedbyte> not for me
[20:00:48] <friedbyte> well, I'm not getting the results I was hoping for :)
[20:01:41] <friedbyte> basically, I'm trying to on click, find the class of the clicked item, and hide anything that doesn't have that class
[20:04:32] <ngharo> hide _anything_?
[20:05:16] <tw2113> damn, my preventDefault didn't work
[20:05:39] <friedbyte> I think I have it now
[20:05:46] <friedbyte> $('#index li:not(.'+ myClass +')').hide();
[20:06:13] <friedbyte> does that look okay?
[20:06:18] <ngharo> yep
[20:07:08] <tw2113> i had $('div').on('click', function() { var myvar = 'testing'; $('#addClass1').addClass(myvar); }); working fine
[20:09:54] <Whirl3d> how do you test if a tr is the last tr in the table? I thought I could use: if (tr.is(":last")) but that didn't work, so I tried if (tr.index()===tr.closest("table").find("tr").length-1)   and even that didn't work.
[20:18:34] <ngharo> $(this).closest('table').find('tr').last().index() === $(this)​​​​.index()
[20:18:56] <ngharo> man my console is screwed up
[20:19:04] <ngharo> curse you crappy utf8 support
[20:20:44] <Ziber> I want to post to a PHP script, but the PHP script is not accessible to my apache virtualhost. I was using $.ajax() but that requires me specifying a URL to the script, rather than a path. Is there another function with which I can specify a filepath instead?
[20:21:42] <ngharo> no
[20:22:02] <species> Ziber: nope. you need some kind of server to process a php page.
[20:22:14] <species> Ziber: if you did have access to the file you would get the raw file
[20:22:53] <Ziber> Hm, yeah, that makes sense.
[20:22:53] <ngharo> you could dump a file in your www directory that calls `php /path/to/somefile.php`
[20:23:00] <ngharo> but thats just awful
[20:23:25] <species> Ziber: what are you actually trying to do? Why is the script not accessible?
[20:23:53] <Ziber> Seems more secure to me to keep the PHP behind the httpdocs/ folder. I guess I don't really have to.
[20:24:27] <species> i see, so in the root of the vhost folder you have httpdocs and public
[20:24:52] <Ziber> something like that.
[20:25:10] <species> in that case, this is a PHP problem, but in summary, you need to add ../httpdocs/ to your PHP_INCLUDE_PATH
[20:25:40] <species> Ziber: http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-include-path.php
[20:25:52] <Ziber> I have a different workaround, but thanks.
[20:26:02] <species> but this is a jquery channel so you should take the problem to a php one like the aptly named #php
[20:26:22] <species> im not sure a workaround is necessary, this is the "correct" solution anyway.
[20:26:40] <species> most projects use this for libraries for example
[20:26:41] <FNTom> species: ##php
[20:29:11] <Whirl3d> I guess I am just completely retarded tonight.

[21:01:35] <justinbmeyer> ziber: I'm not sure how php deserializes urls, but yes, you should be able to

[21:34:01] <justinbmeyer> I needed something that could know which shapes were on screen vs not
[21:44:45] <o]> nicovalencia: I tried to do something like elem.parent().append("<p>test</p>");
[21:45:00] <o]> gf3: but nothing was appended
[21:45:12] <o]> I looked for docs before coming here :(
[21:45:41] <gf3> R U SURE, BRO?
[21:45:51] <gf3> http://jqapi.com/#p=parent
[21:45:53] <gf3> http://jqapi.com/#p=append
[21:46:04] <o]> yes... I have an onclick event
[21:46:12] <o]> so, I get the element from $(this)
[21:46:19] <o]> and I get the parent
[21:46:21] <o]> and I use append
[21:46:25] <o]> and it does nothing
[21:46:38] <o]> if I use a selector, instead of using parent, the content is appended
[21:47:27] <o]> var self = $(this);  var container = self.parent();  container.append(something);
[21:47:41] <o]> for some reason, it is not appending :(
[21:48:22] <Whirl3d> oj, oj, oj, enough with the spamming already
[21:48:26] <Whirl3d> try jsfiddle
[21:48:40] <o]> hmm true
[21:48:44] <Whirl3d> it's easy to use, you can setup a test case and someone willl help right aware
[21:48:46] <Whirl3d> away*
[21:48:46] <o]> I will make a testcase and paste the link here

[21:55:46] <o]> :(
[21:55:48] <ngharo> haha who woulda thought
[21:56:01] <raj> hi gf3
[21:56:04] <o]> Whirl3d: now I cant append on jsfiddle too
[21:56:10] <o]> http://jsfiddle.net/LjxXV/  what is wrong with my append code?
[21:56:34] <Validatorian> Anyone know how to make autoResize work with an iframe using jQueryUI's dialog? EX: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/ -- I want it to look as if the content was not in an iframe, and scale with the content within the iframe.
[21:57:16] <o]> please, help!
[21:58:12] <Whirl3d> oj, when do you call test
[21:58:38] <o]> on onclick
[21:58:40] <o]> of the img
[21:59:15] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/LjxXV/2/
[21:59:32] <Whirl3d> don't use inline click handler's either.
[21:59:42] <o]> why not?
[21:59:47] <Whirl3d> bad form.
[21:59:59] <o]> ok, but that is not the reason
[22:00:01] <o]> of the error
[22:00:36] <Whirl3d> I wish EvilTwin or Shoky or Cork were here, They would explain why you should avoid inline handlers
[22:00:37] <gf3> o]: http://jsfiddle.net/LjxXV/3/
[22:00:53] <gf3> I can tell you why
[22:01:00] <Cork> Whirl3d: you called :)
[22:01:06] <Eviltwin> Because you should keep logic separate from presentation
[22:01:21] <o]> I know, but that is not the reason of the error
[22:01:32] <Whirl3d> so, wait. you guys get called if I type your names. LOL I am sorry I didn't mean to interrupt y'all.
[22:01:35] <Cork> and inline event listners can't co exist with event handlers
[22:01:38] <gf3> 1) They're brittle
[22:01:40] <gf3> 2) The have the potential to cause memory leaks
[22:01:40] <gf3> 3) They do not scale
[22:01:40] <gf3> 4) They're hard to maintain
[22:01:40] <gf3> 5) They're hard to debug
[22:01:46] <o]> ok, I still can't append
[22:01:47] <o]> :(
[22:01:53] <gf3> o]: Yes you can
[22:02:00] <gf3> o]: Look at my example
[22:02:01] <Whirl3d> It's not the append that's the problem
[22:02:03] <o]> hmm
[22:02:16] <o]> great. that solved. so inline handlers would break?
[22:02:21] <o]> what was the problem?
[22:02:46] <Whirl3d> Thanks guys
[22:02:55] <o]> my code has an "event class replacer", but I was just doing a quick test
[22:03:10] <o]> I can move to that approach, but I won't ever know what was wrong...
[22:03:44] <Whirl3d> at the time that the onclick handler was being defined, there was no "test" function to call, so it does nothing?
[22:04:07] <gf3> The problem was that the `test` function was not available
[22:04:19] <o]> Whirl3d: strange. I was able to use alert() inside test
[22:04:30] <Whirl3d> try appending an element with an inline onclick function referencing test and it will probably work because test was defined
[22:04:32] <o]> not on jsfiddle
[22:05:08] <Whirl3d> did you define test in document.ready
[22:05:27] <gf3> It's the onReady/onLoad crap
[22:05:31] <Whirl3d> because chances are if you didn't the search for ".theParent" was resolved before "theParent" was made
[22:05:32] <gf3> It wraps your code in a function
[22:05:33] <o]> yeah! I realize that
[22:05:37] <gf3> Better to do body end
[22:05:45] <o]> but the error is a little different on my browser/site
[22:05:53] <Whirl3d> so the alert would fire (no undefined reference)
[22:05:58] <o]> yes
[22:06:31] <o]> so replace array with delimited string...
[22:06:34] <o]> hehehe
[22:07:47] <Whirl3d> plus you are using .map in a weird way. I think you might mean .each
[22:08:00] <o]> map works with an array, right?
[22:08:13] <gf3> o]: Only in browsers that have it
[22:08:27] <o]> hmm ok
[22:08:29] <o]> I will change. thanks
[22:08:38] <Whirl3d> but the array goes inside of map...it uses $.map not $.fn.map
[22:08:43] <gf3> o]: If you care about IE/older browsers you should use jQuery's janky iterators
[22:08:54] <Whirl3d> $.map(array, function (elem, i) {.....
[22:09:11] <Whirl3d> $(selector).map ( works because it's a different function
[22:09:17] <gf3> Whirl3d: Args are reversed for dumb reasons
[22:09:17] <Whirl3d> it's $.fn.map(
[22:09:31] <gf3> (idx, item)
[22:09:55] <Whirl3d> gf3, I swear, I do it wrong every time. Even when I try to be careful, I overcorrect. LOL
[22:10:07] <o]> worked like a charm :)
[22:10:09] <o]> thanks
[22:10:27] <gf3> Whirl3d: It's okay, it's fucking retarded, you're allowed to get it wrong
[22:11:11] <Whirl3d> pfew
[22:11:14] <Whirl3d> 8)
[22:11:43] <o]> I surrender to those "on load class replacements" :)
[22:14:44] <Validatorian> Anyone know how to make an iframe scale properly within a jQueryUI Dialog? EX: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/ -- I want it to behave as if the content was not in an iframe, and scale with the content within the iframe.
[22:15:39] <Whirl3d> Validatorian, I am sorry that I am unable to help...I've never used an iframe.
[22:16:15] <Validatorian> Whirl3d: They are _so_ much fun, you should give it a whirl... pun entirely intended.
[22:17:15] <Validatorian> I'd prefer to avoid the iframe, but the content will be going on sites that I cannot control that will have CSS that modified the look of the content within the popup, so an iframe is the only way to isolate it from that CSS
[22:17:16] <Whirl3d> 8) I plan to soon.
[22:18:10] <Whirl3d> lemme ask you this: if you have three "adult chat room" sites open and want to show them in three panels on the same page, you can do that with iframe, right?
[22:18:35] <Validatorian> yep, assuming they don't have any security policies forbidding linking via iframe
[22:18:39] <Validatorian> such as google
[22:19:15] <Validatorian> iframes are simply elements that contain an entirely different page within them.
[22:19:28] <Whirl3d> These sites are esentially all just bastardized clones of a some public domain mail system,you can read their code, so I don't think they know what security means.
[22:21:25] <Validatorian> you should summon Eviltwin, shoky and Cork again for my issue, it worked out pretty well last time ;)
[22:21:51] <Whirl3d> I think you just did.
[22:22:05] <Validatorian> *gasp* so I did!
[22:22:38] <Validatorian> Anyone know how to make an iframe scale properly within a jQueryUI Dialog? EX: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/ -- I want it to behave as if the content was not in an iframe, and scale with the content within the iframe.
[22:22:59] <Whirl3d> did you notice the doube scroll bar issue?
[22:23:15] <Ziber> is .toggle({ function() { }, function() { } }); correct syntax?
[22:23:28] <Whirl3d> ? toggle
[22:23:29] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[22:23:40] <Validatorian> double scrollbar?
[22:23:52] <Validatorian> I see one scroll bar, on the right, which is the problem
[22:24:10] <Whirl3d> Validatorian, I see two: when you shrink the window a little, the second one appears
[22:24:29] <Whirl3d> shrink it horizontall
[22:24:48] <Whirl3d> I guess and vertical. LOL
[22:24:49] <Validatorian> well yea, that'll happen. Nobody is going to shrink it though... I just want it to expand to the proper height on load
[22:25:22] <Validatorian> the height can be dynamic, so just setting it isn't going to work
[22:25:49] <Validatorian> there is an 'autoResize' method, but it doesn't seem to work for this situation
[22:26:11] <Validatorian> (this is my first time using jQuery UI)
[22:26:26] <Whirl3d> maybe you need to set the height as the result of an iframe load success callback. Is there such a thing?
[22:27:08] <Validatorian> yep, there is an open callback, but due to JS security policies, I'm thinking I might not have access to the height from the parent document
[22:27:36] <Whirl3d> did you see the article on stackOverflow regarding autosizing iframe content?
[22:27:53] <Whirl3d> apparently you can use the offsetHeight to some extent?
[22:27:57] <Validatorian> yea, I googled this issue for a few hours, nothing I found was beneficial :-/
[22:28:26] <Whirl3d> I figured as much. I thought maybe a fresh set of eyes would help.
[22:30:33] <Whirl3d> maybe you need to call dialog first, then do the rest
[22:31:25] <Validatorian> not sure what you mean
[22:31:36] <Whirl3d> trying something, brb
[22:33:34] <Validatorian> This is interesting, just posted on hacker news, jQuery++: http://jquerypp.com/
[22:36:07] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/1/    this was the idea. but I'm not quite getting it yet
[22:36:49] <Validatorian> ah
[22:37:25] <Whirl3d> then, maybe you can resize on load success
[22:37:43] <Whirl3d> whereas right now, you can't. I am totally guessing.
[22:39:44] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[22:40:11] <Whirl3d> ta da! Here's the answer! Cork to the rescue!
[22:40:41] <Cork> just a warning iframes has a nasty habbit of biting
[22:40:44] <Cork> :)
[22:40:51] <tw2113> and sucking
[22:41:13] <Validatorian> Trying to make an iframe scale properly within a jQueryUI Dialog. EX: http://jsfiddle.net/7cxtp/ -- I want it to behave as if the content was not in an iframe, and scale with the content within the iframe.
[22:41:21] <Whirl3d> lol
[22:41:32] <Cork> Validatorian: and the content is cross domain?
[22:41:36] <Validatorian> correct
[22:41:41] <Cork> no can do then
[22:41:51] <Cork> at least not cross browser
[22:42:04] <Cork> i know its not possible at all in firefox
[22:42:06] <Validatorian> what about Chrome only?
[22:42:11] <Cork> and i don't think you can do it in chrome
[22:42:24] <Validatorian> ... so... it only works in IE. *mind asplodes*
[22:42:29] <Cork> chrome is normally less dynamic with replaced objects then firefox
[22:42:38] <Cork> Validatorian: theres a reason
[22:42:58] <Cork> js from one domain isn't allowed to access the information of another domain
[22:43:11] <Cork> that include the scroll position and page height
[22:43:27] <Validatorian> Right, I'm familiar with that... I was just hoping there was some sort of black magic I could invoke to get around that :-/
[22:43:34] <Cork> ie has always been and prob always will be the least secure browser
[22:43:41] <Cork> when it comes to leaking private information
[22:43:56] <Cork> Validatorian: that would be a security bug in the browser
[22:44:13] <Cork> and would get quite a high priority to get patched if reported
[22:44:50] <Validatorian> alright, guess I'll have to write seriously verbose CSS declarations to ensure my stuff isn't being overwritten by the CSS on the page :-/
[22:45:28] <Cork> i know firefox has a bug/issue that tries to implement dynamic iframe heights
[22:45:36] <Cork> but for now its stagnated
[22:46:11] <snover> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-seamless
[22:46:13] <Validatorian> unless...  As much as I hate it, what about window.open. I'm pretty sure those can be dynamically resized, as so long as it's part of the click handler, it shouldn't cause issues with popup blockers
[22:46:45] <Cork> no you set the size of the window when you open the dialog
[22:46:50] <snover> welcome to the unachievable future
[22:46:55] <Cork> or it gets default dimentions
[22:47:17] <Cork> fyi: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80713
[22:47:40] <Validatorian> I could have sworn back in the way early days there was a "DHTML" script that moved my page around... now that I think of it, I believe it was controlled by flash :-/
[22:47:49] <Cork> sure
[22:48:07] <Cork> if you go far enough back you could do anything cross domain
[22:48:20] <Cork> but over times its been used to steal user information
[22:48:24] <Cork> so its been locked down
[22:48:57] <Cork> latest was to not letting scroll information propagate cross domain
[22:49:10] <Validatorian> ah, interesting
[22:49:18] <Cork> (so that anchors can't scroll the parent page)
[22:49:33] <Cork> and vice versa
[22:49:53] <Validatorian> well, looks like I'm stuck just injecting it via the DOM and making by CSS as bulletproof as possible
[22:50:03] <Cork> it was used to detect if a user ex. was logged in to facebook or similar
[22:50:13] <Cork> Validatorian: yup
[22:50:27] <snover> no it’s cool i didn’t link to a relevant thing
[22:51:00] <Validatorian> snover: is it implemented anywhere?
[22:51:03] <snover> chrome
[22:51:07] <snover> just landed
[22:51:11] <Cork> ah
[22:52:07] <snover> there’s a lot of “same origin” words happening though
[22:53:33] <Validatorian> yea, thinking that's not going to work -- pretty cool though, and I appeciate the link, snover :)
[22:53:46] <Validatorian> And thanks for your help, Cork
[22:53:51] <Cork> np
[22:56:20] <Albright> I'm running an $.ajax() call in 1.4, and even though everything seems to go fine and the server returns 200 OK, the error callback only fires.
[22:56:44] <Albright> If I use Firebug to open the HTTP call in a new window, everything goes fine and I can see the AJAX data in the window.
[22:58:16] <vectorshelve> Cork: I hope u know abt the openads jquery plugin (framework)
[22:58:27] <maja> hello any one have a second to help me with a problem capturing events after ajax call ?
[22:58:33] <vectorshelve> it is bascially jquery in front end + php back end right ?
[22:58:43] <Cork> donno
[22:58:45] <Cork> never used it
[22:58:49] <Cork> or even heard of it
[22:59:02] <Cork> ?ask
[22:59:02] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:59:06] <Cork> maja: ^
[22:59:39] <Whirl3d> can you pass data using Deffered.resolve(); or do you have to use .resolveWith()   ?
[22:59:58] <maja> thanks cork
[23:00:11] <maja> am just not sure about how to phrase the question
[23:00:21] <Cork> Whirl3d: tried checkitng the docs? :D
[23:00:41] <Cork> Whirl3d: "deferred.resolve( args )"
[23:00:41] <Whirl3d> Yeah, it gets confusing. I'll try it again since you seam to want to make a point here.
[23:00:42] <maja> i make an ajax call then have problems with tracking evetns
[23:00:46] <Cork> "args Optional arguments that are passed to the doneCallbacks. "
[23:00:59] <maja> its on this page http://www.chillawhile.co.nz/chillawhile/reservations/
[23:01:27] <Cork> Parse error:  syntax error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_FUNCTION in <b>/home/artvoid/public_html/wp-content/plugins/chillbooking/chillbooking.php
[23:01:30] <ngharo> i'd say you've got a problem
[23:02:01] <Whirl3d> I think I asked the wrong question. Sorry for the hassle. I wasn't asking about that, I was having problems with scoping my deferred.resolves...I think. I'm just going to approach it from another perspective and quite trying to abstract everything.
[23:02:18] <Cork> Whirl3d: scoping?
[23:02:36] <maja> dowww
[23:02:39] <Whirl3d> Kept getting errors like "such and such" has no method "something"
[23:02:39] <maja> i fix that
[23:02:41] <Cork> referred more or less by defenition doesn't use scope
[23:03:26] <Whirl3d> that's where resolveWith comes in, right?
[23:03:31] <Cork> no
[23:03:52] <Cork> thats still not scope
[23:04:06] <maja> sorry about that all fixed nwo
[23:04:15] <Cork> the difference between resolve and resolveWith is that with can set the this variable
[23:04:56] <maja> so when you select the drop downs the first load you'll see the data below the button
[23:04:59] <Cork> maja: where are you doing the ajax call?
[23:05:11] <maja> after the date or number of nights change
[23:05:16] <Cork> file
[23:06:46] <Cork> maja: what file
[23:07:02] <maja> http://www.chillawhile.co.nz/wp-content/plugins/chillbooking/ajaxAvailabMatrix.php?startDate=2%20May%2012&noNights=6
[23:07:17] <Cork> uh...
[23:07:21] <Cork> thats the response
[23:07:27] <Cork> not where your doing the ajax call
[23:07:54] <maja> sorry am a bit new to this
[23:08:39] <ngharo> functions.js
[23:09:01] <maja> yeah http://www.chillawhile.co.nz/wp-content/plugins/chillbooking/frontend/functions.js
[23:09:07] <ngharo> whats the problm
[23:09:25] <maja> after i call the ajax i can no longer track the events that go on
[23:09:50] <maja> if you see it replaces a table and in that table select inputs that i want to track there change
[23:12:12] <Cork> maja: go on
[23:13:28] <ngharo> maja, use .on() syntax when binding to events like $('.rentalSelector').change
[23:13:30] <ngharo> ?on
[23:13:30] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:13:53] <maja> ok i'll try
[23:15:41] <ngharo> do $('#calendarDiv').on('change', '.rentalSelector', function() { ... });
[23:15:45] <ngharo> etc
[23:16:55] <maja> changed
[23:17:04] <ngharo> when you add elements to the dom, handlers you set previously wont be bound to those events on new elements
[23:17:20] <ngharo> using on() or delegate() will take care of that
[23:18:18] <maja> maybe just need to get it working
[23:19:34] <maja> still not working
[23:21:32] <ngharo> i dont see any changes
[23:21:55] <ngharo> specifically to .rentalSelector change
[23:22:03] <ngharo> like i suggested
[23:22:39] <maja> should be
[23:23:15] <ngharo> line 114 interfaces.js
[23:23:56] <maja> changed to this  	$('.rentalSelector').on('change',function(){
[23:24:01] <maja> dodm
[23:24:12] <maja> didn't regeister at all with the #calendarDiv
[23:25:22] <ngharo> read up
[23:25:46] <ngharo> do $('#calendarDiv').on('change', '.rentalSelector', function() { ... });
[23:26:49] <maja> am trying this but not working
[23:27:00] <maja> thats in its current state
[23:28:02] <maja> nothing works when i do that if i switch around it still only works before i do the replacement
[23:29:37] <Whirl3d> so I am working on my first "gallery" script using jquery (yes I know there are tons out there, but none do exactly what I want and I need the experience) and in my "initGallery" function , I setup several gallery methods that I am binding to the div that holds the gallery. Is it bad form to use local references inside of these methods?
[23:29:38] <ngharo> oh its calenderDiv not calendarDiv
[23:30:02] <maja> hehe
[23:30:27] <maja> er ar so close
[23:30:47] <Whirl3d> In other words, I have cached the slideList in a varialble that I am also storing the data object of the parent gallery div. Shouold I look that up whenever I need acess to it or can I used the cached local variable available while binding?
[23:32:01] <maja> sweet as though its working :)
[23:32:05] <maja> thanks very much
[23:32:16] <ngharo> hooray
[23:36:13] <justinbmeyer> whirl3d: I've put my thoughts in here: http://bitovi.com/blog/2010/10/writing-the-perfect-jquery-plugin.html
[23:36:19] <justinbmeyer> on how to make a jQuery plugin
[23:36:56] <Whirl3d> hey, justinbmeyer, I was just reading your posts in the jq++ forum. Thanks for the reply
[23:36:59] <justinbmeyer> I think it's best to use prototypal inheritance of a "Widget" constructor that has the div
[23:37:40] <justinbmeyer> and I would use the cached local variable
[23:37:56] <justinbmeyer> the tricky part can be unbinding
[23:38:22] <justinbmeyer> if your gallery listens to things outside the containing div
[23:39:43] <Cork> ... mad russians...

[23:41:13] <maja> i do love jquery
[23:52:46] <youngin> morning
[23:52:54] <o]> how can I make a link <a> not clickable anymore?
[23:55:07] <Trisox> any one worked with jquery validate's require_from_group ?
[23:56:28] <tw2113> o] you could set pointer-events to none
[23:56:44] <o]> :(
[23:57:12] <tw2113> ?
[23:58:03] <tw2113> hmm, apparently not as supported as i thought
[23:58:18] <tw2113> http://caniuse.com/#feat=pointer-events
