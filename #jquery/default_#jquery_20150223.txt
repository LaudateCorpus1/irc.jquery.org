[00:00:55] <pilgrimish> works just fine in the fiddle, but the same button requires 2 clicks on my site
[00:04:37] <g33kyboi>  pilgrimish: thanks, also found PageSpeed Insights (by Google)
[00:26:01] <FilipNortic> pilgrimish: why are you retuning false from your click element?
[00:26:54] <pilgrimish> not sure, grabbed it from a suggestion on how to fire the play event from a custom button
[00:29:17] <FilipNortic> people here usually recomend aginst it, it can leed to obscure bugs. But I guess if that was the culprit it should work the first time.
[00:33:38] <pilgrimish> thanks for the tip FilipNorticâ€¦ I removed it and still have the same issue, but lighter code is never a problem!
[00:47:52] <jnhghy> How can I check if the user clicks anything on my website and get the id/class of the item he/she clicked on?
[00:48:13] <jnhghy> I've checked so and seen lots of answers but I didn't got it what loop to use...
[00:48:22] <jnhghy> loop/function
[00:49:00] <Ayub> I want to show animation gif after completing synchronous javascript functions..could some one help with sample example ?
[00:49:08] <Uhkis> $(document).on('click', function() { console.log($(this).attr('id')) } should do it
[00:52:07] <jnhghy> Uhkis: can you have a look here please? what am I doing wrong? it should work for buttons but for non clicking elements too (like p or span) http://jsfiddle.net/npvrx6sg/4/
[00:57:55] <Cork> jnhghy: check the browser console
[01:01:36] <Ayub> Cork: would you be able to give some clue on how to show loading image (gif) when executing a time consuming javascript function ?
[01:01:53] <Cork> Ayub: you can't
[01:02:04] <Cork> Ayub: js blocks page updates
[01:02:08] <Uhkis> jnhghy: you dont have jquery loaded
[01:02:30] <Cork> Ayub: only way you could get the animation to work would be if you broke the execution up into small chunks
[01:02:39] <Ayub> Cork: ok, can I use some form of call backs or deffered objects ?
[01:03:01] <Ayub> Cork: I have small chunks of functions which is called by a main function
[01:03:04] <Cork> Ayub: by page updates i mean an animated image will stop animating while the js runs
[01:03:27] <Ayub> Cork: true that the behaviour I am seeing too
[01:03:32] <Cork> you could have a look at webworkers
[01:03:40] <Cork> and run the long running code there
[01:03:52] <Ayub> Cork: that might not work in old browsers right ?
[01:03:53] <Cork> but it isn't well supported in ie
[01:03:57] <Cork> right
[01:04:02] <Ayub> Cork: trye
[01:04:07] <Ayub> true
[01:04:13] <Cork> Ayub: only other option is to break up the execution in short enough intervals
[01:04:37] <Cork> limit the execution sections to say 50-100 ms sections
[01:04:56] <Cork> warning though, this slows down the execution very much
[01:05:02] <Ayub> Cork:ok
[01:05:10] <Cork> also it introduces async to the code execution
[01:05:21] <Cork> so you have to deal with that too
[01:05:41] <Ayub> What if I put entire process in ajax ?
[01:05:48] <Ayub> that should work right ?
[01:05:50] <Cork> you mean run it server side?
[01:05:52] <Cork> sure
[01:06:00] <Ayub> ok on client side
[01:06:08] <Cork> then you aren't using ajax
[01:06:19] <Ayub> client side $.ajax
[01:06:29] <Cork> uh
[01:06:45] <Cork> you mean like $.ajax('about:blank') or what??
[01:06:48] <Uhkis> jnhghy: http://jsfiddle.net/npvrx6sg/6/
[01:07:29] <Cork> Ayub: ajax just pulls data, it doesn't create a separate thread
[01:07:40] <Ayub> Cork: true
[01:07:47] <Ayub> just getting confused
[01:08:17] <Cork> if you need to run a long running section of js without blocking updates of the page
[01:08:21] <Cork> there is only one way
[01:08:27] <Cork> and that is webworkers
[01:08:33] <Ayub> ok
[01:08:49] <Cork> if you can't use webworkrs you have to break up the code in short enough code sections
[01:09:13] <Cork> and make those call each other async (with sendMessage or setTimeout) that page updates doesn't get hindered
[01:10:01] <Ayub> ok
[01:10:04] <Cork> there isn't a third option
[01:10:09] <Cork> oh, sorry there is one
[01:10:15] <Cork> running the code server side
[01:10:26] <Cork> those are all the options
[01:10:38] <Cork> pick your poison :)
[01:10:42] <Ayub> :)
[01:10:44] <Ayub> ok
[01:10:53] <Ayub> Cork: thank you!!
[01:10:57] <Cork> np
[01:12:53] <jnhghy> Uhkis: thanks a lot, it works as it should thank you!
[01:13:29] <Uhkis> np
[01:58:57] <Omar-> good morning!
[02:08:36] <IdanM> morninig...
[02:10:50] <Omar-> :(
[02:10:59] <Omar-> i meant :) lol
[02:14:55] <mikhailtal> Hi, can anybody help me with getting the autocomplete plugin working with an input that is created via an ajax request? http://pastebin.com/ghmEKLE2
[02:16:56] <Cork> mikhailtal: you're better of just binding the autocmoplete in the ajax call
[02:17:23] <Cork> there is more ways then through click you can focus an input field
[02:18:09] <mikhailtal> Cork: thanks, what would be the preferred event to bind on ?
[02:18:19] <Cork> no event
[02:18:32] <Cork> ajax isn't bound to elements
[02:18:53] <Cork> just have it call into the other code section to trigger the binding of autocomplete
[02:19:48] <mikhailtal> ah, I see what you mean - I'll give it try
[02:31:50] <jqueryhelp> Hey guys, does anybody know how to animate from right to left with position relative?
[02:33:28] <jqueryhelp> The toggle works if the div is position absolute, but I need to keep it relative and have it right to left
[02:34:18] <Ankabout> Hi. I'm running into a small issue with a simple script, and hoped someone could help me.
[02:34:53] <Ankabout> http://jsfiddle.net/fbmbc7ha/ - That should show the problem. Basically I'm selecting wrong, adding not only the children of the current selected item, but all matching elements. Can anyone assist?
[02:37:44] <Omar-> jqueryhelp before you animate it set its position to absolute and when you're done set it back to relative
[02:38:54] <Omar-> $(".selector").css("position","absolute").animate({ left: value, speed, function () { $(this).css("position","relative")  } });
[02:40:09] <Uhkis> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/fbmbc7ha/1/ like this?
[02:41:00] <Ankabout> Uhkis: not exactly. But I just stumbled onto this.... http://jsfiddle.net/fbmbc7ha/2/
[02:41:14] <Ankabout> So I htiunk I solve it. I think that was my problem
[02:41:55] <Uhkis> Ankabout: why not addClass btw?
[02:42:43] <Ankabout> Uhkis: because the elements need to be wrapped. it's not about the class, it's about wrapping a selection of the children
[02:42:55] <Uhkis> ok
[02:44:28] <Ankabout> makes sense? Or am I doing something stupid? (Obviously the jsfiddle is just an example, what I'm actually doing is different, but I just used this to illustrate my problem
[02:48:09] <Cork> Ankabout: you can just set "selected" on the elements and handle the styling of them "as a group" in css
[02:49:07] <Ankabout> Cork: I'm not using this to style actually. I literally need the children in a wrapper element, and I can't do that efficiently in the original markup
[02:49:32] <Cork> ya, there are situations for that
[02:49:46] <Cork> my point was just that you CAN do it with a class on the elements too :)
[02:49:55] <Ankabout> haha yeah. Thanks for the tip :)
[02:56:43] <jqueryhelp> Omar- Thanks! Don't know why I didn't think of that, but I went ahead and simplified it a bit more as well. I just made the selector absolute in the .css and just made the change on animation as you mentioned
[03:01:15] <Omar-> jqueryhelp you're welcome :)
[03:01:35] <jqueryhelp> saved me a few hours of no sleep :D
[03:04:00] <Omar-> ;)
[03:05:02] <Tennis> I just solved a jquery issue in like 10 mintues after failing to come up with a solution for a month. Fresh perspective does wonders
[03:05:20] <ifmeister> Cool
[03:12:25] <kokut> Hello, how do you store the data of a get request in a variable?
[03:13:46] <Cork> kokut: you store it like any other value, i suspect your problem is that ajax is async
[03:14:07] <Cork> so you can't have access to it in the same code path as where the call started
[03:14:16] <Cork> (you have to use the callbacks)
[03:18:08] <kokut> Cork: thanks man, gotta take a look at it
[03:33:50] <Xatenev> Cork: what OS are you using for development?
[03:34:05] <Cork> Xatenev: linux
[03:34:22] <Xatenev> Cork: which dist?
[03:34:27] <Cork> arch
[03:34:32] <Xatenev> oh cool
[03:34:32] <Xatenev> :P
[03:36:45] <Uhkis> Linux arch 3.18.6-1-ARCH here too :-)
[03:42:31] <bl4ckdu5t> Hi y'all
[03:42:41] <bl4ckdu5t> I've been having a problem with this for some days http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/myLbNw
[03:43:25] <bl4ckdu5t> I need the #wrap to get a class fixed at a distance of 170px from top
[03:44:06] <bl4ckdu5t> and that'll make the search bar get fixed to the top as it is styled #fixed input { position: fixed; }
[04:18:10] <Juslintek> hey can anyone tell me why page is not creating owl object? http://idealine.lt/ window.owl doesn't exist. And because of that I can't call owl.trigger
[05:14:41] <mezod> why can it be that the sender and the placeholder are undefined on the drop event of an item dragged between two different sortable lists?
[05:15:24] <cjohnson> paste your code?
[05:21:47] <mezod> cjohnson: I have something that can be simplified to this http://jsfiddle.net/k5stp1tg/
[05:24:00] <cjohnson> placeholder seems defined there
[05:24:04] <cjohnson> I just console.logged i
[05:25:29] <mezod> yes
[05:25:49] <cjohnson> so what's the problem?
[05:25:55] <Omar-> !ping arschmitz
[05:25:57] <mezod> sender is still undefined
[05:26:03] <mezod> and well, it is not easy to replicate
[05:26:22] <mezod> I am doing exactly the same but with more options that should really affect that
[05:26:55] <cjohnson> oh you're using the stop event
[05:27:02] <cjohnson> that's not the event you use to check for cross-list dragging
[05:27:03] <cjohnson> http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-receive
[05:27:07] <cjohnson> this is where sender is defined
[05:28:22] <mezod> cjohnson: hmm thanks, however, why does the stop event have a sender/placeholder then?
[05:28:48] <mezod> sender/placeholder only makes sense with connected lists I presume?
[05:28:57] <cjohnson> not sure, that could have something to do with it
[05:29:02] <cjohnson> jquery ui is a little inconsistent
[05:29:36] <mezod> oh
[05:57:04] <prohobo> is there anything better than jquery?
[06:13:27] <kokut> Hello, could anyone explain a lil bit how could i do a callback with data fetched with ajax?
[06:14:50] <nardev> guys is there any property of ajax which i can run after i get success???
[06:15:03] <BillCriswell> kokut: Chain a .done() to it and give it a function.
[06:15:17] <BillCriswell> nardev: The same thing I told kokut.
[06:15:24] <kokut> BillCriswell: okay i will give it a try
[06:15:26] <nardev> BillCriswell, .done will runn after error and and success
[06:15:36] <nardev> i want the window to close only after success
[06:15:56] <nardev> kokut, is thee any wayt to determine if i get success or error?
[06:17:03] <BillCriswell> nardev: That's not true.
[06:17:37] <BillCriswell> You're thinking .always()
[06:18:20] <nardev> BillCriswell, in case form validation fails, i want to return information and keep overlay form/div open in case of success i want it to close!
[06:19:00] <nardev> how does jquery know what to do.. i always return something...
[06:19:41] <BillCriswell> There's a huge difference between you returning errors or a ajax request failing.
[06:20:55] <nardev> BillCriswell, COOOOOOOOL i know that
[06:21:13] <nardev> that is why i'm asking how to "send back" to .ajax that
[06:21:22] <nardev> it should not close the form...
[06:21:31] <nardev> but to write a message...
[06:22:02] <nardev> ???
[06:22:07] <BillCriswell> .done(function(result) { if (result.success) { closeModal(); } else { writeErrors() } });
[06:22:44] <nardev> BillCriswell, result.success holds what data and how?
[06:23:25] <BillCriswell> nardev: I'd have whatever resource is on that end return some json with a success variable that tells me what happened.
[06:24:01] <nardev> BillCriswell, well if variable is a solution, that is fine too i just asked what is most common way
[06:24:07] <nardev> that is what i was looking for...
[06:24:17] <BillCriswell> Cool.
[06:24:27] <nardev> although that destroys my life
[06:25:55] <BillCriswell> Rough.
[06:31:25] <kardon> helo
[06:38:44] <Iota> Hey guys, I have a jQueryUI question. What's the correct way to update an element? This is killing off the <span> which displays the arrow. http://jsfiddle.net/noLuj09w/
[06:44:45] <BillCriswell> Iota: What's your end goal here? Can't help but feel like something is being overcomplicated.
[06:45:33] <Iota> I wanted to change the text on th header of the accordion, but by doing so it removed the span (little arrow).
[06:49:17] <mbrzuzy> lota, you would have to modify your JS to work with what the accordion puts in there
[06:49:27] <mbrzuzy> once solution would be to grab the span before updating the title
[06:50:13] <mbrzuzy> var span = $('.title span').outerHtml();  $('.title').html(span + 'New Title');
[06:50:15] <mbrzuzy> something like that
[06:50:34] <mbrzuzy> @Iota
[06:51:21] <Iota> Thanks mbrzuzy.
[06:51:25] <BillCriswell> Iota: personally I'd replace #menu completely.
[06:51:38] <BillCriswell> then run accordion on it again.
[06:51:47] <Iota> I was just given another solution which seems a lot simpler. Want me to share?
[06:51:59] <Iota> http://jsfiddle.net/noLuj09w/1/
[06:52:08] <BillCriswell> or whatever that is.
[06:52:26] <Iota> I feel very silly, but I'm new to Javascript and jQuery. :P
[06:52:33] <Iota> Apreciate the help, guys.
[06:55:12] <BillCriswell> That's fine, there's really no simple way to do that cause of all the mostly unknown markup accordian can add.
[06:55:13] <BillCriswell> Iota: do you really just have one item in that accordion? I wouldn't use the full on accordion for that.
[06:57:21] <Iota> Naw, I'm using it slightly differently. I just wrote that up to ask how to update it.
[07:00:17] <Blinky_> Hi all, I am having an issue with a script and wondering if someone could help.  I am using a datalist that is populated from a sql database but also allows for user input.  I want to be able to send an AJAX request depending on the id of the selected option from the list.  I know that the live search works as does the file the AJAX is calling, what I cant get to work is the collection of the ID number from the list. - http://pastie.
[07:00:31] <Blinky_> Any ideas where I am going wrong?
[07:07:34] <Blinky_> Hi all, I am having an issue with a script and wondering if someone could help.  I am using a datalist that is populated from a sql database but also allows for user input.

[07:08:19] <Iota> The paste link appears to cutoff just after the word pastie.
[07:08:46] <Blinky_> http://pastie.org/9975011
[07:08:51] <Blinky_> That better?
[07:13:41] <belleah> anyone able to help with jquery-ui's draggable/droppable functionality?
[07:16:53] <BillCriswell> belleah: What's the issue?
[07:17:08] <BillCriswell> Your best bet is to set up a fiddle and just ask though.
[07:17:09] <Blinky_> Iota: Any ideas mate?
[07:17:55] <belleah> I am trying to create a drag and drop and i'm using the helper: "clone" inside the draggable, however, when I go to drag it somewhere else on the screen it just disappears when I release the mouse.
[07:18:10] <Iota> I'm sorry, Blinky_. I'm very new to jQuery, haven't looked into ajax in much detail before.
[07:18:48] <BillCriswell> belleah: Are you dropping it somewhere valid?
[07:19:12] <Blinky_> Iota: NP mate, in the same boat as you.
[07:19:27] <Blinky_> Hi all, I am having an issue with a script and wondering if someone could help.  I am using a datalist that is populated from a sql database but also allows for user input.  I want to be able to send an AJAX request depending on the id of the selected option from the list.  I know that the live search works as does the file the AJAX is calling, what I cant get to work is the collection of the ID number from the list.
[07:19:27] <belleah> its within the same div at the moment eventually i would like to have it attache to a html5 canvas but i'll cross that bridge when I get there.
[07:19:31] <Blinky_> http://pastie.org/9975011
[07:22:51] <Omar-> Blinky_ id collection works, http://jsfiddle.net/zbchmk3k/
[07:23:03] <Omar-> what isnt working?
[07:24:58] <Blinky_> Omar-: Cheers for looking, when I change the fo to clientSearch it fails, by that I been nothing is logged in the console.
[07:25:00] <slax0r> ohai, I have multiple arrays, and I need to find item(s) that are in all those arrays, is there a convenient function for that in JS before I go and implement my own?
[07:25:47] <Omar-> Blinky_ can you share your HTML? is your select element dynamically created?
[07:25:58] <BillCriswell> belleah: http://jsbin.com/piboqi/1/edit?js,output can you show me here?
[07:26:56] <Omar-> slax0r i'm not into JS but I guess .fliter(function () {}); will do
[07:27:04] <Omar-> or .indexOf()
[07:27:36] <Blinky_> Omar-: The datalist is at the top of the pastie mate, It is being populated by a live search.  This is the php file that is creating the options - http://pastie.org/9975089
[07:30:32] <slax0r> Omar-: I know how to do it manually, just though there was a native function to do this for me
[07:30:36] <slax0r> but, php.js to the rescue
[07:33:36] <Blinky_> Omar-: OK so I think I have identified the issue.  The options part of the coding is not being displayed in the code.  When I do a search and then select something CTRL+U does not show that option within the datalist part of the code.
[07:33:47] <belleah> sorry BillCriswell, got caught up in something else for work

[08:12:02] <silverfix> Hello guys, is there a reason why if I bind a function on event 'change' on a radio it is triggered twice ? http://pastebin.com/xUHDnDvi
[08:16:43] <BillCriswell> silverfix: Do you have two radio buttons with the same id?
[08:23:51] <lau_home> Greetings, I am populating a json object via ajax and using "innerHTML" to apply it. With this dynamic js/html my $("[id=^check_this]").onclick() did not work. I was advised to change it to $("[id=^check_this]").on("click"). however, I still get the same result. It is if the dymanically(js) created html is not "recognised" by either the onclick or the on("click") functions. Both on and onclick work fine if the html is not dynamica
[08:24:23] <lau_home> any suggestions or pointers on how to address this or searching for it with the correct terminology ?
[08:26:49] <Omar-> lau_home delegate event $(document).on("click", "[id=^check_this]", function () { code });
[08:27:46] <lau_home> Omar-: thanks, will try it
[08:32:25] <lau_home> Omar-: Thanks! that did the trick!
[08:33:06] * lau_home does victory dance ... \o\  /o/
[08:33:16] <sukima> How do I tell is a dom element is nested under a parent element but could be nested: <li id="x"><a><span id="y"></span></a></li> then $.contains(x, y) is false due to nesting
[08:34:12] <cjohnson> $.contains(y, x)
[08:34:36] <cjohnson> wait
[08:34:42] <cjohnson> no you had it right. paste your code
[08:37:25] <MajorWork> how can i change an iframes href ?
[08:37:42] <MajorWork> sure i saw it in this book but i can only find css changes
[08:37:51] <cjohnson> it's src
[08:38:01] <MajorWork> src not href cool
[08:39:01] <MajorWork> something like $('content').attr('src','google.co.uk');
[08:39:28] <robertmaxrees> sorta, though some sites won't allow you to randomly do that.
[08:39:51] <sukima> cjohnson: Thanks, seems to work in isolation, Must have a bug somewhere.
[08:41:46] <_DB> how can I delete the slected date in jquery DatePicker
[08:43:14] <cjohnson> it's just a normal input
[08:43:16] <cjohnson> clear the input's value
[08:45:27] <_DB> I tried didnt work
[08:48:16] <Omar-> _DB maybe you need to .datepicker("refresh") after clearing the value
[08:52:13] <_DB> .datepicker("refresh") gives me undefined and $('#mform_end_d').datepicker('setValue', null ); gives me 31/12/1969
[08:54:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might need to approach this problem differently, _DB
[08:54:22] <davidstreck> http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[08:54:28] <davidstreck> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
[08:54:30] <_DB> yeah Ive been trying since friday (not including the weekend)
[08:54:44] <_DB> I checked the docs couldnt find anything
[08:55:00] <_DB> (i also checked stack overflow seems a lot of people couldnt get it to work)
[08:55:10] <Omar-> _DB have you tried destorying and then reinitializing the widget?
[08:55:16] <davidstreck> what is it that your trying to do. sorry jumping into the convo late
[08:55:20] <Omar-> dont trust SO
[08:55:22] <Omar-> haha
[08:55:33] <robertmaxrees> either do what Omar- suggested or reconsider the approach entirely.
[08:55:36] <_DB> davidstreck
[08:55:39] <_DB> woah you fixed it lol
[08:55:52] <_DB> well figured it out .datepicker() sets it to 0
[08:55:59] <_DB> thanks guys
[08:56:06] <Omar-> np, glad you got it solved
[08:56:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's reinitializing it.
[09:00:31] <davidstreck> :)
[09:01:44] <cjohnson> _DB: http://jsfiddle.net/ca704w3L/
[09:01:51] <cjohnson> it works fine here
[09:02:39] <_DB> oh wow youre right I must have never tried that..
[09:02:52] <_DB> I guess i jumped right into it using datepicker() functions
[09:03:21] <cjohnson> the datepicker is just a fancy way of changing a standard input's value, not any special kind of form field
[09:04:22] <tandroid> How do you get the text of only the selected element and not the child elements?
[09:05:13] <robertmaxrees> the text or the vlaue?
[09:05:27] <tandroid> text like you would get from .text()
[09:05:48] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to get the :selected element's text.
[09:06:06] <robertmaxrees> I assume you're using a <select> yeah?
[09:06:31] <tandroid> Oh no, hold on one sec.
[09:06:48] <davidstreck> I personaly like this framework for a date picker: http://felicegattuso.com/projects/datedropper/
[09:06:59] <tandroid> robertmaxrees:  http://jsfiddle.net/d14k3hce/2/
[09:07:13] <tandroid> I don't want the text in the anchor tag
[09:07:22] <tandroid> just the text in the div.
[09:07:35] <robertmaxrees> tandroid there are a few different ways to do it.  one is to use .contents() and grab the first textnode.
[09:07:53] <davidstreck> @_DB you should check out: http://felicegattuso.com/projects/datedropper/
[09:08:37] <cjohnson> davidstreck: seems useless on a desktop
[09:09:03] <cjohnson> having to scroll 10 times to get the 13th is painful
[09:09:24] <robertmaxrees> tandroid alternatively you can see if the current element has any child nodes and, if so, use replace() on the parent element's text() to remove that text.
[09:09:45] <davidstreck> @cjohnson the first example is the desktop demo
[09:10:04] <cjohnson> there's no full calendar popup
[09:10:54] <cjohnson> it seems painful everywhere but particularly insulting on a desktop where you could at least have a proper datepicker
[09:11:48] <davidstreck> select each element one by one. I do agree that it is cumbersome. Just a different approach. Kind of tired of see the same date picker everywhere. but i guess if its not broken donâ€™t fix it
[09:11:54] <tandroid> robertmaxrees: didn't know about content() thanks!
[09:12:04] <robertmaxrees> tandroid fsho.
[09:13:48] <davidstreck> @cjohnson: another downfall is that its only supports IE9 and up
[09:14:37] <davidstreck> but then again I guess IE 8 and under is no longer supported so Iâ€™m not sure where I stand as for support
[09:14:58] <robertmaxrees> what are your users using? :)
[09:15:07] <robertmaxrees> that's what we use to gauge what to support.
[09:16:25] <davidstreck> @robertmaxrees true that, always learn the audience your building for. Thank goodness for google analytic
[09:16:35] <robertmaxrees> and omniture :)
[09:35:19] * Omar- wipes channel's floor
[09:36:09] <Omar-> too much cigarette butts
[09:38:24] <kann_> anyone know anything about making a images act like google maps? need the image to seem like its infinite when in reality its just going to the other side of the image when it runs out of space
[09:41:43] <Forbidd3n> Anyone use dropzone that allows you to store files and upload when form is submitted?
[09:41:57] <Forbidd3n> If not dropzone. Anyone have any other solution similiar?
[09:42:09] <Omar-> kann_ you mean something like this? http://codecanyon.net/item/360-panoramic-viewer-jquery-plugin/2684810
[09:46:11] <davidstreck> @omar: I think he is talking about : http://www.dropzonejs.com/
[09:46:35] <davidstreck> you could build a custom one using jQuery UI
[09:46:37] <Omar-> davidstreck that was for kann_ not Forbidd3n ;)
[09:46:58] <davidstreck> @Omar: sorry about that
[09:47:32] <kann_> Omar- was right in what I needed. I am making a map and the client wants it to seem "infinite" but infinite is unrealistic so going for the google map type effect
[09:49:33] <Forbidd3n> davidstreck: I am looking for an out of the box solution - no need to reinvent the wheel. there must be somehting out there that does this already
[09:50:28] <davidstreck> whatâ€™s wrong with http://www.dropzonejs.com/?
[09:51:11] <funkt> Hi there I am trying to use slick carousel if anyone here may have used it. Inside the options is a responsive way of making the slider remove itself under a certain breakpoint which is just what i want the prob is i want to come back after it reverts back to normal which I cannot seem to do would anyone have any ideas?
[09:53:00] <Omar-> davidstreck no worries! :)
[09:53:24] <davidstreck> @Omar: :)
[09:54:44] <Omar-> kann_ true, infinite viewing in all directions sounds unrealistic.
[09:55:21] <Omar-> funkt use media queries
[09:55:41] <robertmaxrees> funkt you might have to reinit it, depending on how it "removes' things.
[09:55:47] <Omar-> breakpoint { display: none; };
[09:56:04] <kann_> Omar- that's why I"m trying to make the map act like google maps where if i drag the map to one side, the other side "appears" like it is a globe and they are just going around the globe
[09:56:10] <davidstreck> @Forbidd3n: never used it or know much about it but here is another option that is out of the box: http://codecanyon.net/item/html5-file-upload/9254506
[09:56:35] <funkt> what is reinit? sorry?
[09:56:52] <pilgrimish> looking to work out why my custom play button (when viewed at 768 or less) requires 2 clicks after the first pause, when the fiddle only needs 1â€¦http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/ http://jsfiddle.net/Pilgrimish/k5z4w572/42/
[09:56:55] <robertmaxrees> most plugins require that you run some kind of method for it to show up on the page - you might have to re-run that.
[09:56:58] <funkt> thank you I just don't know if I could display none
[09:57:06] <funkt> could i?
[09:57:20] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:57:30] <robertmaxrees> instead of using its built-in setup
[09:57:58] <Omar-> kann_ check this http://blog.mikecouturier.com/2011/07/create-zoomable-images-using-google.html
[09:59:02] <funkt> the problem is the class that would display none is the control class for the carousel if I was to display none it would remove everything on a smaller breakpoint
[09:59:13] <funkt> it wraps all the content
[10:00:33] <funkt> http://pastebin.com/cwihqpHF
[10:00:43] <funkt> it is wrapped in autoplay class
[10:01:25] <funkt> what I would like to try is a responsive jquery media greater or less than but it just wont work?
[10:09:25] <ul71m0> I have a product page with carousel, when i change color of the product it loads new images with Ajax, but than my carousel javascript inst loaded until i refresh the page. Anyone have an idea how to fix this+
[10:14:06] <Omar-> ul71m0 reinitialize the plugin
[10:14:28] <Omar-> like you initialize it on the first run
[10:16:55] <ul71m0> Omar-: not sure how :/
[10:17:26] <Omar-> create a sample page in fiddle pls
[10:17:27] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0 you do it once on pageload, so do it again in the .done() callback for the ajax call.
[10:19:21] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/q1qznouw/6/ This is what I am trying to achieve here you can see there is a button to slick and unslick what I would love to do is do this on screen width
[10:19:38] <robertmaxrees> check window width on resize.
[10:19:47] <funkt> currently I can only unslick but it wont return to slick on resize
[10:30:17] <Omar-> funkt http://jsfiddle.net/LemvmLff/1/
[10:30:50] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/LemvmLff/1/show/ resize window
[10:30:54] <elehas1388> Hello everyone. I have somewhat of a difficult task at hand I'm trying to wrap my head around. It involves some jquery calcs and css3 transitions. Anybody have any idea how to expand a hidden div from the origin of a clicked element. i.e. a tile is clicked, the expanded version is shown and animated to 100% width and height from the tile's position on the window.
[10:31:38] <funkt> thanks omar v.kind cannot see any difference
[10:32:14] <Omar-> funkt http://jsfiddle.net/LemvmLff/1/show/ run this in full screen then rezise the window < 500px
[10:32:25] <Omar-> then maximize it
[10:33:35] <funkt> thank you Omar I still cannot seem to replicate this?
[10:33:38] <funkt> weird?
[10:34:12] <Omar-> funkt maybe I got your wrong. you want images to stack above each other when window's width is below X pixels right?
[10:34:33] <Omar-> and get them next to each other when width is greater than X pixels
[10:35:19] <funkt> correct to disable and then renable the carousel at a breakpoint of say 800px
[10:35:27] <funkt> stick and unstick
[10:36:54] <funkt> I see so what you are doing is triggering the buttons at these breakpoints?
[10:37:01] <ul71m0> Omar-: thanks
[10:40:11] <funkt> I just cannot understand how to do this!
[10:40:22] <funkt> thanks for your help Omar
[10:40:36] <robertmaxrees> you already have the code.
[10:41:46] <Omar-> elehas1388 like this? http://jsfiddle.net/nzkLwLzg/
[10:42:00] <Omar-> funkt you haz teh codez ;)
[10:42:20] <Omar-> ul71m0 you're welcome, I did nothing tho..
[10:42:34] <funkt> Oh I see
[10:42:43] <funkt> so I already have the code?
[10:42:49] <funkt> ...
[10:42:55] <Omar-> lol
[10:43:03] <funkt> so why wont it work then lol
[10:43:11] <robertmaxrees> funkt you need to put it in a resize event handler.
[10:43:25] <funkt> hmm
[10:43:55] <funkt> any ideas how i do that?
[10:44:01] <robertmaxrees> search google mang.
[10:44:11] <funkt> http://jsfiddle.net/tu4mhr6q/
[10:44:12] <Omar-> elehas1388 better http://jsfiddle.net/nzkLwLzg/1/
[10:44:26] <robertmaxrees> funkt try searching google for window resize event handler
[10:44:29] <KevinCollmer> hi
[10:44:31] <KevinCollmer> :)
[10:44:51] <Omar-> funkt teh codez http://jsfiddle.net/a7967rv2/
[10:45:03] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[10:45:07] <robertmaxrees> don't click the button.
[10:45:11] <robertmaxrees> run the code directly.
[10:45:17] <Omar-> maybe robertmaxrees has better solution
[10:45:32] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i know, it was a fast solution ;)
[10:45:40] <Omar-> run teh codez!
[10:45:50] <Omar-> hi KevinCollmer
[10:46:10] <funkt> I have run the code and it does not work on browser resize
[10:46:11] <KevinCollmer> I've got a question about jQuery and maybe CSS... http://crackware.eu/_NEW/#registration  Just enter "123456789" in every input to get the success message. I want to fadeout the form and fadeIn a div with a "your registration is complete" message. Is there an option to slowly degrees the div-size?
[10:46:21] <Omar->     $(window).trigger("resize"); is good on first load
[10:46:27] <KevinCollmer> its hard to explain... you will see what i mean
[10:47:49] <KevinCollmer> it looks horrible at the moment because the div is changing the size instantly but i want the div to fade the size
[10:48:04] <robertmaxrees> KevinCollmer "fade the size" or "slide"?
[10:48:04] <KevinCollmer> problem is: its responsive so i cant use exact heights
[10:48:09] <KevinCollmer> slide
[10:48:17] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery slide
[10:48:17] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .slideDown() | jQuery API Documentation â†’ http://api.jquery.com/slidedown/
[10:48:23] <robertmaxrees> there's also a slideUp()
[10:49:39] <KevinCollmer> hm I dont know if I can use slidedown...
[10:49:53] <robertmaxrees> check out slideUp
[10:49:56] <KevinCollmer> because i need to fadeout the 'form' and fadein a 'div'
[10:50:05] <KevinCollmer> dont know where i should use slideDown
[10:50:06] <robertmaxrees> fade or slide?
[10:50:30] <KevinCollmer> atm im using this: if(responseData.complete == true) { 											form.fadeOut(900); 											$('#signup-complete').text('COMPLETE') 										   .fadeIn(200); 										}
[10:53:03] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is that you want the simultaneous fades
[10:53:08] <robertmaxrees> one out while the other in?
[10:53:22] <KevinCollmer> yes
[10:53:26] <KevinCollmer> and the problem is
[10:53:36] <KevinCollmer> the form is much bigger then the div
[10:53:54] <KevinCollmer> and it fades out smooth but then change the size of the parent div instantly
[10:54:00] <KevinCollmer> to match the size of the much smaller div
[10:54:27] <robertmaxrees> you can grab the height of that other container and slide to that hight.
[10:54:28] <robertmaxrees> *height
[10:54:35] <Omar-> KevinCollmer have you tried animate({width: 0, height:0, opacity:, 0})
[10:55:12] <robertmaxrees> ^ good point, it'll keep animating "behind" the other container
[10:55:50] <KevinCollmer> i will try this
[10:56:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd just animate the height and opacity instead of the current "hide" code.
[10:56:20] <KevinCollmer> but the problem is the responsive design
[10:56:34] <KevinCollmer> the font-size is different on any resolution
[10:56:45] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[10:56:56] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with what Omar- just gave you.
[10:57:08] <KevinCollmer> ok i will try it
[10:58:58] <Omar-> opacity: 0
[10:59:04] <Omar-> there was an extra comma
[10:59:12] <robertmaxrees> he'll probably catch that.
[10:59:24] <Omar-> i like to give clean codez :P
[10:59:46] <Omar-> he would catch it after scratching his head for about 2 hours
[10:59:58] <Omar-> it happenend to me several times
[11:00:13] <robertmaxrees> nah - just get a linter to point those things out :)
[11:00:26] <Omar-> jsfiddle is good
[11:00:33] <Omar-> i use it to catch errors
[11:00:38] <Omar-> anyway, I gtg now
[11:00:44] <Omar-> talk to you later guys
[11:50:15] <jrich523> is there a way to say, if not bound, bind? $("li").click(function(){})
[11:50:32] <jrich523> basically i add li's on the fly and need to add events to the new ones
[11:50:40] <jrich523> im adding them by appending html
[11:59:52] <samssh> jrich523, This probably isn't optimal solution, but if you have (or can get) the count of elements already in the DOM, you can use the jquery :gt() selector to get only the elements after the (previous) last one.
[12:00:25] <jrich523> i think i've got a way to get the new one
[12:00:39] <jrich523> i saw some stuff about .off('click').on(.....
[12:00:54] <jrich523> seemed like it could be expensive, but there are probably only like 25 nodes max
[12:01:30] <samssh> jrich523, Oh, if it's just one new element, you could create the element before insertion, and attach the listener to the held reference.
[12:02:31] <samssh> jrich523, OR, if you don't need different handlers for each element, you could use a single delegated handler on the parent ul.
[12:02:47] <jrich523> that sounds like a better idea
[12:04:06] <jrich523> yeah, that looks way better, thanks
[12:04:16] <samssh> np

[12:24:11] <funkt> Also any ideas how I remove the click functions and just have the window resize?
[12:25:36] <decx> don't trigger a click every time
[12:25:59] <decx> right now when the window is under 900px it'll trigger a click many many many many many times
[12:26:07] <decx> many !
[12:32:06] <funkt> cheers decx
[12:32:12] <funkt> how do i correct it?
[12:32:13] <BillCriswell> decx: many manies.
[12:34:50] <funkt> any ideas?
[12:35:22] <Dr-007> anyone familiar with jquery selectBox? how do you refresh a checkbox?
[12:36:36] <Dr-007> funkt: remove click functions, you could override a click function on a button and do e.stopPropagation()
[12:37:03] <funkt> thanks dr-007 I have no idea how to do that sounds amazing though
[12:37:20] <funkt> I'm so close
[12:37:57] <Dr-007> $('.your_button').click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[12:39:03] <Dr-007> this way only this click function is being called and not all other click functions. eg 'remove' click function
[12:39:56] <funkt> thank you! but I still don't know where to place this!
[12:40:35] <Dr-007> inside a <script> tag :p

[12:42:43] <Dr-007> what is it you're trying to do?
[12:43:21] <Dr-007> why do you need: <funkt> Also any ideas how I remove the click functions and just have the window resize?
[12:44:31] <funkt> Because all I want to do is keep the carousel on 900px and then remove it under 900px
[12:44:51] <funkt> This was a fiddle I found and I tried to adpat it to do just that
[12:45:10] <funkt> except I am having trouble I dont need the click function only the resize oprion
[12:45:12] <funkt> option
[12:45:33] <funkt> and it works but needs to be resized twice in order for it to work
[12:45:39] <Dr-007> the click function = the click and drag?
[12:46:32] <funkt> / Slick/Unslick
[12:46:33] <funkt>     $('.btn-unslick').on('click', function (e) {
[12:46:33] <funkt>         if (slickEnabled) {

[12:49:00] <funkt> Dr-007 your idea actually works I think
[12:49:05] <funkt> thank you!

[13:06:30] <_DB> will it be the first input?
[13:06:33] <funkt> so for example someone twists and ipad responsive one way and then dead the other
[13:06:51] <decx> funkt i have  an old demo for something like that here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/pNzZz/
[13:06:52] <funkt> I can't kill and then get it back again
[13:06:52] <cjohnson> _DB: Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements.
[13:07:21] <funkt> wow that looks serious
[13:07:21] <_DB> take that as a yes?
[13:07:22] <_DB> XD
[13:07:45] <funkt> I haven't a clue how I could construct that with this
[13:09:26] <Dr-007> well
[13:09:30] <Dr-007> it was something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/gfh8sugn/1/
[13:09:34] <Dr-007> but im getting an error now
[13:09:38] <Dr-007> but im out
[13:09:39] <Dr-007> laterz
[13:09:54] <cjohnson> _DB: use your brain and read the sentence
[13:10:15] <_DB> thats why i said ill take it as a yes
[13:10:31] <_DB>  to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements....sounds like what im looking for
[13:10:32] <funkt> cheers Dr-007
[13:11:02] <funkt> decx have you ever used this carousel before?
[13:12:05] <funkt> Seems crazy I can only have it responsive one way kill it and then not regenerate it the other way after
[13:12:22] <tandroid> functt: are you using slick?
[13:12:30] <tandroid> It has a refresh method
[13:12:33] <funkt> yes tandrois
[13:12:40] <funkt> oops tandroid
[13:12:44] <funkt> ohhhh great
[13:12:55] <funkt> so after kill i could refresh?
[13:13:03] <funkt> thats what I am after!
[13:13:33] <decx> funkt http://jsfiddle.net/rf0j4ur7/7/
[13:14:11] <decx> just a few things moved around and added to the conditional
[13:14:24] <funkt> wow!!!!
[13:14:28] <funkt> you did it!
[13:14:40] <funkt> thanks so much decx and it works on all browsers!
[13:14:58] <decx> i only wrote && and moved your stuff around ;)
[13:15:12] <funkt> haha cheers m8 I have been at this for hourss
[13:15:26] <funkt> Very kind thank you!!!
[13:15:41] <decx> do you get it?
[13:16:04] <funkt> would like to say I did get it
[13:16:15] <decx> good
[13:17:50] <funkt> lol but I don't think I did
[13:18:01] <funkt> Ill have a really good look
[13:18:41] <funkt> Thanks again!
[13:23:41] <decx> lol
[13:47:11] <robertmaxrees> helluva day.
[13:48:19] <Valduare> whats up robertmaxrees
[13:48:40] <robertmaxrees> kickin' around.  you?
[13:49:49] <Valduare> seeing light at the end of a big long tunnel with this launch heh
[13:49:59] <robertmaxrees> nice!
[13:50:29] <Valduare> AND i got a fresh coffee in my mug too heh
[13:51:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:59:48] <ShooterMG> anybody know of a plugin that will resize text so that it always fills all of the available space of a div, without resizing the div?
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> define "resize"
[14:00:41] <BillCriswell> ShooterMG: fittext I believe.
[14:00:53] <BillCriswell> http://fittextjs.com/
[14:00:58] <ShooterMG> BillCriswell: Thanks, but that's only for single-line text
[14:01:09] <ShooterMG> I've also tried slabText, and that's better, but it doesn't take vertical space into account
[14:01:17] <BillCriswell> Oh haha.
[14:01:23] <BillCriswell> text-align: justify :-p
[14:01:29] <ShooterMG> haha :P
[14:40:09] <z1haze> would anyone please tell me how i would make this work with jquery 1.11.x?
[14:40:12] <z1haze> http://fmarcia.info/jquery/tetris/tetris.js
[14:40:20] <robertmaxrees> what's wrong with it now?
[14:41:10] <z1haze> syntax errors, unrecognized expression: #^1
[14:41:15] <robertmaxrees> what line?
[14:41:37] <z1haze> well, the error comes from jquery
[14:41:41] <z1haze> not from the tetris file
[14:41:50] <z1haze> but when i used old jquery it goes away
[14:41:53] <robertmaxrees> there should be a stack trace available.
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> i'll guess you've got a selector that you need to escape before feeding it to jQuery
[14:42:31] <z1haze> well since jquery is minified it just says line 2
[14:42:45] <robertmaxrees> the stack trace will tell you what function in this JS file.
[14:42:54] <z1haze> What do you mean? im sorry
[14:43:02] <robertmaxrees> are you in chrome or FF?
[14:43:05] <z1haze> chrome
[14:43:11] <z1haze> im looking in console now
[14:43:13] <robertmaxrees> see the little arrow to the left of the error?
[14:43:19] <z1haze> it just highlights the entire minified line
[14:44:15] <z1haze> no i dont see any arrow
[14:44:27] <robertmaxrees> that's weird.  can you fiddle this up then?
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> oh and $.browser doesn't exist in newer versions of jquery .
[14:45:51] <z1haze> sure let me put it on a fiddle
[14:46:57] <neanderslob> hi everyone, I have a bunch of element ids like #dynam0, #dynam1, #dynam10, #dynam100  I would like to access the number following "dynam" and save them to a variable, is there an easy way to chop those characters off?
[14:47:11] <z1haze> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/Loz15gg2/
[14:47:23] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob you want an attribute contains selector.
[14:47:48] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: cool, I'll have a look at that, thanks
[14:47:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze that's not throwing an error for me.
[14:48:45] <z1haze> it doesnt work
[14:48:59] <robertmaxrees> errr lol okay. how am i supposed to troubleshoot it then?
[14:49:04] <z1haze> heh i dunno
[14:49:12] <z1haze> the error is there without the fiddle
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> query
[14:49:25] <robertmaxrees> [2015:02:23:14:46:52] * Velveeta (~velveeta@174.46.3.102) Quit (Ping timeout: 272 seconds
[14:49:32] <robertmaxrees>  woops http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Loz15gg2/1/ here we go.
[14:50:00] <robertmaxrees> so if you go to your console there, you should see the same error, right?
[14:50:00] <z1haze> there yea how did you make that happen
[14:50:08] <robertmaxrees> killed the window load stuff.
[14:50:36] <z1haze> oh would this be able to just get fixed to work with that version of jquery?
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:50:49] <robertmaxrees> the window load doesn't fix anything.
[14:51:00] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: ah, I think that's close (and actually relevant to something I was going to need a little later) but I'm not having trouble selecting the element, I'm just having trouble extracting the number itself from the id
[14:51:03] <z1haze> well, notice the game wont work on new jquery is what i'm saying
[14:51:05] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/KbRPl4c.png is this the error you were getting on your pase, z1haze
[14:51:10] <z1haze> yea
[14:51:52] <robertmaxrees> z1haze http://i.imgur.com/xduZaYz.png click the grey arrow.
[14:52:02] <z1haze> do i have to initialize in a document ready wrapper?
[14:52:02] <z1haze> ok
[14:52:21] <z1haze> yea i dont have that arrow
[14:52:36] <robertmaxrees> O.o weird.  anyway, tetris.cells[i][j] = $(['#', k, j].join('')); it's this line.
[14:52:53] <z1haze> http://puu.sh/g9SPO/c4a8888eb4.png
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you've got some invalid selectors.
[14:53:18] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob you want the number out of the ID?
[14:53:24] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: bingo
[14:53:25] <robertmaxrees> you can use a regex for that.
[14:53:30] <robertmaxrees> or a simple string replace.
[14:53:32] <dn5> Hello guys, how can I pass an argument from javascript function to $('#...').attr('src', argument)
[14:53:46] <z1haze> did the selectors change since the version of jquery this was probably built with?
[14:53:56] <robertmaxrees> dn5 you can use a var there...
[14:54:08] <dn5> ohh yes... damn
[14:54:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze sizzle and jquery might be less tolerant of bad characters.
[14:54:23] <dn5> I didn't sleep for 2 nights, thanks robertmaxrees
[14:54:24] <robertmaxrees> i've seen stuff like this before.
[14:54:27] <robertmaxrees> dn5 fsho.
[14:54:55] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: ah, didn't know javascript had that; will investigate; thanks!
[14:55:19] <robertmaxrees> fsho neanderslob
[14:57:00] <z1haze> Would you mind instructing me on how to fix this? I dont know much about jquery
[14:57:12] <z1haze> this script is a free source code i found
[14:57:24] <z1haze> But my page uses more up to date jquery
[14:58:05] <robertmaxrees> you probably need to escape the selectors at play.
[14:58:12] <robertmaxrees> it's trying to do #^1 as a selector.
[14:58:23] <z1haze> I don't even know what that means
[14:58:30] <robertmaxrees> which part?
[14:58:38] <z1haze> escape selectors at play
[14:59:00] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't like $('#^1') - you might need to escape the ^ charactor.
[14:59:03] <robertmaxrees> *character.
[14:59:19] <jherm> I just stumbled across some interesting code: $(â€˜#some_idâ€™).html(data).promise().done(function() { /* â€¦ */ });
[14:59:34] <z1haze> i dont even see #^1 anywhere in that entire file
[14:59:35] <jherm> Isn't html() a synchronous call?
[14:59:39] <robertmaxrees> jherm yep.
[14:59:41] <robertmaxrees> that's totally useless.
[14:59:46] <robertmaxrees> z1haze right - see the error it's throwing?
[15:00:04] <jherm> ty. Someone said the same thing here. http://digitizor.com/2013/08/03/jquery-html-callback-function-using-promise/
[15:00:19] <z1haze> yes, Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #^1
[15:00:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:00:32] <robertmaxrees> the "expression" is the problme.
[15:00:35] <robertmaxrees> *problem
[15:00:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you have that those nested for loops going on - tetris.cells[i][j] = $(['#', k, j].join('')); is where that's generating that error from
[15:00:45] <z1haze> but i just searched the entire file, its not even in there
[15:00:55] <robertmaxrees> reread what i just said.
[15:01:29] <z1haze> ok just searched entire file, didnt even find '#'
[15:01:36] <robertmaxrees> z1haze again.
[15:01:44] <robertmaxrees> tetris.cells[i][j] = $(['#', k, j].join('')); is where it's generating that expression.
[15:01:48] <z1haze> i found it on my local copy, jsfiddle is dumb it didnt find it
[15:01:55] <z1haze> i see the line now
[15:02:20] <z1haze> tetris.cells[i][j] = $(['#', k, j].join('')); so i guess I need to do something with the #?
[15:02:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[15:02:39] <robertmaxrees> see the second paragraph on that page.
[15:03:47] <z1haze> soo. tetris.cells[i][j] = $(['\\#', k, j].join('')); ?
[15:03:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:03:55] <robertmaxrees> really?
[15:04:21] <robertmaxrees> ^ is the problem.
[15:04:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to detect for that char and escape it when necessary.
[15:05:02] <z1haze> how can I do that when there isnt a single ^ in the entire file
[15:05:10] <robertmaxrees> your real problem is likely k = String.fromCharCode(i + 97);
[15:05:37] <robertmaxrees> it's getting generated from there, so you'll need to see if that char is a ^ and change the string to be \\^ instead.
[15:06:11] <z1haze> I can imagine how frustrating this must be.. but.. WHAT?
[15:06:40] <robertmaxrees> to which part?
[15:06:48] <robertmaxrees> did you read the page i linked you?
[15:06:48] <z1haze> any of it man
[15:06:50] <z1haze> yes
[15:06:57] <z1haze> the paragraph youasked me to
[15:07:02] <robertmaxrees> "To use any of the meta-characters ( such as  !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ ) as a literal part of a name, it must be escaped with with two backslashes: \\."
[15:07:14] <LeBlaaanc> Is there an elegant way of getting .next() then the first sibling if it hits the end?
[15:07:28] <robertmaxrees> z1haze look at those meta-chars again.  see any characters in there that might be causing headaches?
[15:07:31] <z1haze> Right I get it, but if its being generated from a dunction..
[15:07:55] <z1haze> meta-chars where?
[15:08:04] <robertmaxrees> ( such as  !"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~ )
[15:08:12] <z1haze> apparently its the ^
[15:08:15] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:08:24] <z1haze> but what im trying to understand is that there's not asingle friggin ^ in the entire js file
[15:08:28] <z1haze> where the heck is it coming from
[15:08:31] <robertmaxrees> k = String.fromCharCode(i + 97);
[15:08:39] <robertmaxrees> read the for loop.  that's where it's getting generated.
[15:08:53] <z1haze> what makes you think its that line
[15:09:23] <robertmaxrees> because the invalid expression is #^1.  the only thing that could generate the ^ anywhere in the file is that like.
[15:09:24] <robertmaxrees> *line
[15:09:27] <tandroid> LeBlaaanc: I don't know about elegant but you could just check the index against the length of the selection.
[15:09:38] <z1haze> and even so if its being generated from that string.fromcharscode function.. how can i escape it
[15:09:40] <LeBlaaanc> $next_player = ($current_player.next().length) ? $current_player.next() : $('.videos .video:first-of-type'); hah ya that's as elegant as I could make it
[15:09:53] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you check after it's generated and prepend the value with '\\'
[15:10:21] <z1haze> like this? $(['#', '\\'k
[15:10:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:10:31] <z1haze> guh
[15:10:54] <robertmaxrees> you'll need a conditoonal of some kind in there.
[15:11:12] <robertmaxrees> after the k is set but before the tetris.cells() call
[15:11:33] <z1haze> like an if (k.contains ^ or something like that
[15:11:39] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> that's one way
[15:13:55] <z1haze> this is probably all wrong but.. if (f.search('^')) {
[15:13:55] <z1haze>  $(k).prepend( $( '\\' ) );
[15:13:55] <z1haze>  }
[15:14:04] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:14:08] <z1haze> well, k.search
[15:14:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[15:14:17] <z1haze> dude obviously im struggling here
[15:14:19] <robertmaxrees> first, please don't multiline paste into the channel.
[15:14:44] <robertmaxrees> sorry - let's back up - are you familiar with basic string concatenation or equality in JS?
[15:14:56] <z1haze> what do you mean, i probably am somewhat
[15:15:12] <robertmaxrees> then do if (k === '^')
[15:15:28] <z1haze> i thoght it was a string though
[15:15:35] <z1haze> i didnt know it was justa single character
[15:15:43] <robertmaxrees> single chars are strings.
[15:15:59] <z1haze> i dont know what the difference between == and ===
[15:16:16] <robertmaxrees> $(['#', k, j].join('')); is generating a three character string for a selector.  the k var is what we care about specifically here.
[15:16:35] <robertmaxrees> === is strict equality.  you should generally opt for it instead of ==, which doesn't coerce values.
[15:16:45] <robertmaxrees> *== DOES coerce values, rather.
[15:16:51] <robertmaxrees> which is generally bad and not what you want.
[15:17:54] <z1haze> so it could just be k = '\\' + k; ?
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:18:17] <robertmaxrees> in that if check.
[15:18:29] <z1haze> yea
[15:19:03] <z1haze> oh gosh, now its another one.. looks like its the ` key
[15:19:09] <z1haze> gonna have to do a bunch of these
[15:19:13] <robertmaxrees> alright, so let's back up.
[15:19:25] <robertmaxrees> because i'll bet you there's a fundamental problem in the code somewhere.
[15:19:45] <robertmaxrees> i wonder what k = String.fromCharCode(i + 97); is really trying to accomplish.
[15:20:07] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3145030/convert-integer-into-its-character-equivalent-in-javascript should just about do it.
[15:20:11] <z1haze> well i fixed the ` one and there were no more errors on initialization but its still broken
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, tetris.bound = $.browser == 'msie' ? '#tetris' : window; is your next issue.
[15:20:33] <robertmaxrees> and the code that you've got there doesn't make much sense.
[15:20:34] <z1haze> u just get, undefied is not a function $('#start').unclick(tetris.start).val('pause').click(tetris.pause);
[15:20:46] <robertmaxrees> unclick() isn't a thing.
[15:20:48] <z1haze> like i said i got it for free
[15:21:04] <z1haze> http://fmarcia.info/jquery/tetris/tetris.html
[15:21:10] <robertmaxrees> so?  jQuery is free. and it's quality :)
[15:23:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that fromCharCode() call is bad.  the init is all wrong.
[15:25:07] <dn5> is this correct syntax for chaning css of an element: $('.classname').css('visibility', 'hidden') ?
[15:25:23] <robertmaxrees> yes
[15:25:50] <z1haze> well robert, would would not be easy to make work then?
[15:26:05] <LeBlaaanc> anyone have any suggestions on how to determine swipe gestures? I'm using hammer.js and it's painfully inconsistent.
[15:26:06] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily about ease, just time.
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> nested for loops are an interesting problem.
[15:27:25] <z1haze> should should i check into next then ill keep trying to get it working just dont really know what to do
[15:27:48] <robertmaxrees> looks like just a silly little tetris game - is it really that important?
[15:28:08] <robertmaxrees> or you could make a project out of updating it.
[15:28:34] <z1haze> well it is a silly tetris game
[15:28:39] <z1haze> but i wasnt able to find one thats up to date
[15:28:47] <dn5> thanks robermaxrees, and is there any way that I can pass a string to the tag without css.. for example <h2 class="aa">123</h2>, to add hidden like <h2 class="aa" hidden>123</h2> by using class name?
[15:28:55] <z1haze> tetris.start is not a function i guess?
[15:28:58] <robertmaxrees> dn5 huh?
[15:29:18] <robertmaxrees> z1haze yeah because you have other errors causing things to bomb out.
[15:29:36] <dn5> robertmaxrees: to clarify, how to set "hidden" into a class name
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> .addClass()
[15:30:41] <dn5> got it, many thanks
[15:54:49] <dn5> how can I edit css from multiple classes like: class-sublime-skin .class-progress-control
[16:01:12] <dn5> robertmaxrees: do you perhaps know
[16:01:51] <Cork> edit css?
[16:02:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[16:02:30] <dn5> I have multiple classes .blabla .blabla1 {visiblity:hidden}, is there way to change this to visible
[16:02:59] <Cork> dn5: have an additional class overriding it
[16:03:07] <dn5> like $(".blabla .blabla1").css('visiblity', 'visible');
[16:03:14] <Cork> and set it to those elements or a parent when you want it
[16:03:27] <robertmaxrees> dn5 $(".blabla, .blabla1").css('visiblity', 'visible');
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> same way you would with CSS.
[16:04:49] <dn5> so I forgot the comma, wow.. was bugging me for half an hour
[16:05:00] <dn5> Cork: thanks for suggestion, but I didn't want to change original source of library
[16:28:02] <frabblerock> anyone in here use shufflejs?
[16:28:07] <neanderslob_> hi there, I'm attempting to use regular expressions to extract a number from an id string but am confronted by what looks like an array rather than a string when I try to do so
[16:28:18] <neanderslob_> the problem is described here https://gist.github.com/BigMcLargeHuge/0c579200a5a1604f6018
[16:28:22] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ frabblerock

[16:29:01] <neanderslob_> could anyone point me in the right direction on this?
[16:29:09] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob_ 1 sec.  going to show you.
[16:29:46] <neanderslob_> robertmaxrees: to the rescue again; thanks

[16:29:53] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[16:30:13] <frabblerock> robertmaxrees why would i ask a question no one may have the answer to, in other words why i spend my time and someone elses asking a question, rather than asking if there was anyone available with experience pertaining to a specific jquery library. Instead I'm spending my time responding to your message, because youre on some IRC trip throwing out alerts whenever you feel you can.
[16:30:56] <robertmaxrees> oftentimes people have questions that don't require a topic expert for help.
[16:32:08] <frabblerock> my javascript
[16:32:09] <frabblerock> http://pastie.org/9976521
[16:32:14] <frabblerock> the website
[16:32:15] <frabblerock> http://dev.buffalonews.com/Brett/thingstodo.buffalonews.com/events/
[16:32:18] <neanderslob_> robertmaxrees: so the idea is that match just returns an array and you just need to work with it as such?
[16:32:18] <frabblerock> the problem
[16:32:31] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob_ yep - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wa2ysx8p/1/
[16:32:45] <frabblerock> FIltering isn't working when i click a category, unless i click the category, start a search, then delete all characters from the search input
[16:32:47] <neanderslob_> robertmaxrees: cool, thanks again
[16:32:50] <frabblerock> not sure what's causing this
[16:33:11] <robertmaxrees> frabblerock hah, i used to work with a company that did work with buffalo
[16:33:34] <frabblerock> with the news?
[16:33:37] <robertmaxrees> advertsing.
[16:34:28] <frabblerock> ah cool.
[16:34:38] <robertmaxrees> and it's probably at least partially because you have a value set on that search input.
[16:36:41] <frabblerock> nope - that's not.
[16:42:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  even calling the method directly doesn't work without modifying the search box somehow.
[16:48:47] <frabblerock> yeah
[16:48:51] <frabblerock> not sure why that is
[16:49:48] <robertmaxrees> looks like maybe the group objkect isn't properly formatted - the docs look like they're expecting a funcion for those, but i could be wrong.
[16:50:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to fiddle it up and play with it for a while, but that's my guess.
[16:57:58] <frabblerock> if you look in the console when searching
[16:58:06] <frabblerock> by clicking the categories
[16:58:13] <frabblerock> youll see its getting the right group
[16:58:24] <frabblerock> but it's not reading the data attribute correctly it seems
[16:59:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm thinking that object is your problem - the docs make it look like it wants a function instead of some other obkect.
[16:59:37] <robertmaxrees> *object
[17:00:17] <frabblerock> where are you referring to?
[17:00:50] <robertmaxrees>  group = isActive ? 'all' : $this.data('category');
[17:02:06] <frabblerock> that's what theyre doing in their demo
[17:02:30] <frabblerock> so lame
[17:02:40] <frabblerock> it's because i was using data-category instead of data-group
[17:02:46] <robertmaxrees> hah, that'll do it.
[17:02:51] <frabblerock> seems its restricted what I name it
[17:03:03] <robertmaxrees> how would it know to look at data-group?
[17:03:59] <frabblerock> im assuming its tied to something in the library
[17:04:28] <frabblerock> im not really sure
[17:04:47] <robertmaxrees> well, yeah.  it needs a specific data attr to work off of.  it wouldn't magically know to look elsehwere.
[17:07:29] <frabblerock> the search could look in data-categories
[17:07:38] <frabblerock> i originally had it set to data-categories
[17:09:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so it was just the wrong data attr before, right?
[17:54:31] <smo_> hi
[17:54:50] <smo_> how can i list img in a page but only with height > 200px
[17:54:51] <smo_> ?
[18:01:00] <b00th> Is this what you're looking for? http://codepen.io/cameron992/pen/YPLEjE
[18:09:51] <asahi> when I do .blur(handler), if handler is a defined function, then it seems to just run that function. Is there a way of preventing this?
[18:18:42] <BillCriswell> asahi: You want to disable it?
[18:20:13] <asahi> BillCriswell: I'm looking to do the same thing as when the handler is an anonymous function
[18:21:25] <BillCriswell> It does.

[18:51:46] <_eddy> hello guys http://jsfiddle.net/baako/xzoau2mL/ why isnt it posting to that url?
[18:52:36] <p3rsist> Hi guys. Any of you use jQuery to inline CSS from stylesheets? (for emails)
[18:52:59] <_eddy> this is what the url looks like file:///android_asset/www/create.html?name=baako&email=baako40@gmail.com&password=password&password_again=password&createFormsubmit=
[19:13:12] <BillCriswell> p3rsist: Javascript in emails doesn't seem like it'll go over well.
[19:32:21] <p3rsist> BillCriswell, I want to use jQuery to output html for emails not to use Javascript with them.
[19:32:36] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[19:57:12] <aro> has anyone used uploadify/five
[20:04:25] <jeffmjack> is it ok to simple concatenate a bunch of different minified js files?
[20:04:54] <jeffmjack> I'm wondering if that might not create scope problems if the same algorithms are used for, e.g. renaming functions

[20:53:03] <negi> hey i want to make multiple id droppable
[20:53:12] <negi> http://jsfiddle.net/IrvinDominin/v3L7A/
[20:53:39] <negi> here's my fiddle how can i make multiple id droppable
[20:55:08] <negi> like i push the id in array and make it droppable
[20:55:18] <negi> if anyone know then plz
[21:38:26] <negi> http://jsfiddle.net/ojc6fhvy/13/
[21:38:34] <negi> that's my new fidle
[23:06:38] <shmoon_> is there an iOS style date/timepicker plugin in JS ?
[23:08:53] <Cork> ?g jquery ios timepicker
[23:08:53] <b-ot> Cork: mobiscroll - Mobiscroll is a library of Touch UI Components created ... â†’ http://code.google.com/p/mobiscroll/
[23:45:45] <negi> http://jsfiddle.net/ojc6fhvy/14/
[23:45:49] <negi> i want to make multiple id droppable
[23:45:59] <negi> $("#0,#1,#2,#3,#4,#5,#6,#7,#8").droppable on my fiddle i done something like that for multiple droopable
[23:46:04] <negi> i want something new like with the help of array i want to do
[23:46:13] <negi> on array i want to pushh all id and make it droopable
[23:46:24] <negi> $("#"+ array[]).droppable something like that
[23:48:09] <dziegler> negi: i guess you want to use a class as selector $('.dropme').droppable() ?
[23:48:35] <negi> dude i use it and it's work
[23:49:06] <negi> imagine i have 100 id so i write it
[23:49:14] <negi> i want simple way
[23:49:26] <Cork> negi: the solution is to add a class
[23:49:37] <dziegler> Cork: thanks :D
[23:49:43] <Cork> its in efficient to use hundreds of ids for a selector
[23:49:50] <Cork> *inefficient
[23:50:20] <Cork> class was invented exactly for accessing a group of elements
[23:50:38] <Cork> so ya, dzieglers solution is correct
[23:52:01] <negi> Cork good to use class but my id is dynamic so i think class idea is not soo good
[23:52:37] <Cork> negi: not sure how the dynamic nature of an id somehow talks against a class...
[23:53:16] <negi> ok cork how can i do that plz tell me or update on my fiddle b coz i am not understand
[23:53:22] <negi> about class concept
[23:54:05] <Cork> also number only id's isn't the best of choices
[23:54:36] <negi> iyeah sure but i want to choose number for my id's
[23:55:17] <Cork> negi: as the code that generates the content with the id isn't in the fiddle, that makes that hard
[23:56:04] <negi> on drop i generate the id so as a hard code i write id in class
[23:56:13] <negi> like 1 to n
[23:56:37] <Cork> ah there
[23:57:09] <dziegler> negi: you can create callback functions, than normaly you dont need to use ids because you can use var $this = $(this) inside your callback
[23:57:37] <negi> no no no it's multiple droopable
[23:57:51] <negi> it's create problem
[23:57:51] <Cork> negi: http://jsfiddle.net/ojc6fhvy/15/
