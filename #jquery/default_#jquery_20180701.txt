[10:01:37] <Anticom> Hi. Why is this event not firing? http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/336963/
[10:01:47] <Anticom> or the handler not listening on it to be more precise probably
[10:06:50] <ryan_ford> your selector
[10:07:17] <ryan_ford> try `var $radios = $('form [type=radio]');`
[10:07:52] <Anticom> ryan_ford: what's wrong with the selector?
[10:08:12] <Anticom> https://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[10:08:50] <ryan_ford> actually your original works for me in FF
[10:10:18] <ryan_ford> what browser are you using?
[10:10:23] <Anticom> chromium
[10:11:17] <Anticom> Cork: you here? o/
[10:13:28] <ryan_ford> works for me on chromium too
[10:13:29] <Anticom> I guess firing change event manually fixes the issue. still want to know why that's neccesary tho... http://jsfiddle.net/xpvt214o/336984/
[10:13:45] <Anticom> ryan_ford: well then you didn't read the code properly
[10:14:05] <Anticom> i'm selecting a value after registering a change listener
[10:15:50] <ryan_ford> so you want only 2 to show if it got selected?
[10:17:53] <Anticom> ryan_ford: what? no i want the listener to fire when selecting a radio using jquery
[10:18:15] <Anticom> when i do fire the change event manaully it works however i don't understand why this is neccesary
[10:18:34] <Anticom> or rather explicitly, not manually
[10:21:52] <ryan_ford> i get an alert, when i click either button. I'm not really sure what you're trying to do, you want to select the radio with js/jq and it's not triggering the change? in the fiddle you're not trying to change it or anything, you're just creating a listener
[10:31:34] <Anticom> ryan_ford: as i already assumed, you didn't read the code properly. See L8: $radios.filter('[value=two]').prop('checked', true);
[10:31:47] <Anticom> of course i am changing it
[10:32:01] <Anticom> But nvm, the actual issue is resolved already
[17:06:39] <SuExeC> I have a few <a href> that have a class, .link_listener. I have registered a method , $(".link_listener").on('click', function() {..} );. When I load the page, this works fine. If I click the link, and the page reloads with an attribute in the url, i.e ?pauseJob, the trigger stops working. What am I doing wrong ?
[17:16:56] <SuExeC> Same thing if I add the class to a <li> element instead. "Clean url", i.e index.php works fine. As soon as a link loads and the url turns into index.php?pauseJob, the javascript doesn't trigger anymore.
[17:18:59] <SuExeC> This is jquery mobile, for the record
[17:28:05] <pavonia> SuExeC: Is the served page the same with or without query string?
[17:30:31] <SuExeC> pavonia, the page changes slightly
[17:31:47] <pavonia> I don't think it has anything to do with the JS/jQuery code but with the served HTML code
[17:32:18] <pavonia> i.e. event handlers not bound properly or something
[17:33:45] <SuExeC> pavonia, Makes sense. The jQuery/JS works fine when there is no query string. How can that happen though? Why wouldn't it bind?
[17:35:26] <pavonia> Don't know, unbalanced tags in the query string processing code
[17:36:14] <pavonia> Have you diff'ed the two pages?
[17:40:27] <SuExeC> pavonia, it's the same page, only a few contained elements within that change. I am wondering if I need this though, https://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/
[17:43:15] <pavonia> Could also be the other page makes the loading slower which prevents the elements from already existing when the handlers are bound
[17:43:16] <SuExeC> pavonia, that seems to have helped a bit
[17:45:07] <SuExeC> pavonia, yep, fixed it with $( document ).on( "pagecontainerbeforeshow", function( event, ui ). I guess this is some jquery mobile specific stuff
[17:48:57] <Al_nz1> I want to lock open the collapsable sections of this form that contain data (ie 1 or more checkboxes are ticked or there is data in the comments section) - how would I go about this? http://jsfiddle.net/x1hphsvb/5717/
[19:45:24] <darkhanb> I see that $.get(...) sends "X-Requested-With" header set to "XMLHttpRequest" on my Chrome. Will it work the same way on every other browsers?
[19:45:58] <darkhanb> Also does $.post(...) set the same header?
[20:05:14] <shoky_> darkhanb: yes
[20:09:38] <darkhanb> shoky_ thanks
