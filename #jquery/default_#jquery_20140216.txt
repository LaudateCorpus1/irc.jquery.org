[00:00:08] <specious> Darkingz: in your Monster.autoMove() -> if(x = undefined ...
[00:00:19] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/34Q3Y/3/
[00:00:20] <specious> Darkingz: use ==
[00:00:35] <s5fs> specious: why not === ?
[00:01:12] <Darkingz> okay that shouldn't be an issue though, it's really strange that in jsfiddle it works fine but in my chrome browser it throws errors
[00:01:41] <Tomashe> did u guys saw my example i just paste.. why the "x" isnt output "this"
[00:03:07] <vladikoff> Tomashe, see http://jsfiddle.net/34Q3Y/5/
[00:03:41] <Tomashe> x = GetIt(x); < but without that
[00:03:49] <Tomashe> i want to se it inside GetIt
[00:04:20] <vladikoff> Tomashe, http://jsfiddle.net/34Q3Y/6/
[00:05:14] <Tomashe> I DONT GET IT REALLY
[00:05:49] <Tomashe> why i need waffles = 'this';    x = waffles; , whats wrong with just x = 'this' ;
[00:06:43] <specious> s5fs: tru dat :) - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined
[00:07:31] <Darkingz> is there an issue with jquery animate and chrome?
[00:07:36] <vladikoff> Darkingz, no
[00:07:51] <Darkingz> that is so odd
[00:08:16] <Darkingz> jsfiddle works but exact same code and running natively in browser fails
[00:19:09] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/34Q3Y/8/ < ok guys what about that , there is a chance that "x" will get undifined because it set before the done returned?
[00:19:13] <Tomashe> or something like that?
[00:20:44] <Tomashe> since when i console.log(data) inside the done() i get the resuts, but if i run console.log(x) after x = GetIt(), i still get undefined
[00:21:35] <vladikoff> Tomashe, http://fixingthesejquery.com/images/ajax101.png
[00:22:31] <Tomashe> ??
[00:22:33] <Tomashe> what that means
[00:26:18] <Tomashe> valadikoff, so how do i get it right?
[00:31:54] <sikor_sxe> hello, what could be wrong if no resize handle appears on my "resizable" elements?
[00:33:58] <vladikoff> sikor_sxe, jquery ui?
[00:34:04] <sikor_sxe> yes
[00:34:17] <vladikoff> sikor_sxe, did CSS for it load?
[00:36:28] <sikor_sxe> uhm, no. thanks :)
[00:57:38] <jop008> I have a hyperlink in a textarea without markup how can I add markup to it running jqmobile
[00:57:56] <jop008> I tried textarea a:link {color:#FF0000;}      /* unvisited link */
[02:29:51] <basiclaser> i was curious to know how you'd solve this - I have a clock here, and I would like to stick a logo next to it (the one in the top left corner), but the clock string is sized and positioned by fittext.js, which adapts to viewport. Is there a way to staple an image to the side of it? or make the image behave like a string character? thanks. http://basic-laser.com/100b/test/
[03:26:08] <opalepatrick> trying to pass a textarea value http://pastebin.com/NkQdtAPN jquery 1.9.1 - dont have a problem with input values done same way. Textarea handled differently?
[03:30:12] <jcubic> opalepatrick: you need to use val() it's a function
[03:31:31] <ahandy> if you guys go to http://thetoke.com/ and then when the website loads, click on the third listing option on the top right, the one that looks like rectangles on top of each other
[03:31:40] <ahandy> and then just hover around.. i want to know how to do that in just jquery, is it possibel?
[03:31:42] <ahandy> possible*
[03:32:16] <opalepatrick> jcubic, thank you so much. Dont know how many times I have looked at that and the one that worked side by side and didnt see those missing brackets.
[05:58:23] <n-a-n> hi all
[05:59:51] <hpekdemir> hi all. see my nopaste: http://nopaste.info/161409229f.html
[06:00:08] <hpekdemir> my cover box (a spinner/loader div) does not disappear when used in Jquery.ajaxSetup
[06:00:23] <hpekdemir> but it works if used in document ready or window.load
[06:00:56] <hpekdemir> I can use box2.remove() also. it is a helper function. this works, too. outside of ajaxsetup. but never in ajaxsetup. why?
[06:09:44] <mrkie> hello
[06:10:01] <mrkie> can somebody give me a solution in order to disable the fade effect here: http://jsfiddle.net/AAFaY/26/ ?
[06:11:03] <mrkie> i need something that does the same like     $('#extra').slideToggle('fast'); but without slide
[06:11:20] <mrkie> i tried just Toggle instead but it will keep sliding
[06:19:17] <mrkie> sorry
[06:19:30] <Catalin-> mrkie I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand what you're trying to achieve.
[06:19:36] <mrkie> i got it already http://jsfiddle.net/AAFaY/27/ i used before a Toggle(); function instead of toggle();
[06:19:40] <mrkie> the last one worked
[06:19:45] <Catalin-> Cool :)
[06:19:52] <mrkie> my fault
[06:19:53] <mrkie> :)
[06:19:58] <mrkie> not so cool :)
[06:20:13] <Catalin-> Cool that you managed in the end.
[06:20:30] <Catalin-> errors are cool, they bring the best in us hehe
[06:24:23] <mrkie> everyone starts with an error
[06:28:54] <mrkie> would someone have any suggestions on this http://jsfiddle.net/AAFaY/28/ ?
[06:29:06] <mrkie> maybe a better or cleaner code
[06:29:16] <mrkie> better not means cleaner always

[07:04:36] <Vivekananda> hi everyone. I changed the hover() to .on('hover' ) too in this gist and it works here but is not working on my page. Jquery is loading too. I tried to put in a console.log within the function but it isnot even getting called !!

[07:06:31] <Vivekananda>  hi everyone. I changed the hover() to .on('hover' ) too in this gist and it works here but is not working on my page. Jquery is loading too. I tried to put in a console.log within the function but it isnot even getting called !! Http://jsfiddle.net/LUWP6/3/   http://imagebin.org/293676
[07:11:48] <sacho> soo..what's your page?
[07:12:49] <Uhkis> Vivekananda: https://api.jquery.com/on/ see the mouseenter example
[07:14:05] <Vivekananda> Uhkis: am I supposedly doing something worng or incompletely ?
[07:18:23] <Vivekananda> Uhkis: even the onclick is notworking
[07:19:00] <Vivekananda> but it works for something in the html but ont for thisdynamically generated word !!
[07:20:28] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/LUWP6/4/
[07:22:22] <mrkie> how about this http://jsfiddle.net/n4NqR/4/ does it look ok?
[07:24:17] <Vivekananda> Uhkis: that is not working either :(
[07:24:42] <decx> why use mouseenter for something that can be done with css?
[07:25:08] <Uhkis> mrkie: http://jsfiddle.net/n4NqR/6/ less lines, same functionality
[07:25:37] <Vivekananda> Can it be that I need more libraries to load for hover, mouseenter to work ?
[07:25:43] <Uhkis> no
[07:25:53] <Vivekananda> what I hve loaded are visible above in what I pasted
[07:26:00] <mrkie> Uhkis: what you mean axactly? what would you strip off?
[07:26:01] <Vivekananda> then why are things not loaded
[07:26:17] <Uhkis> mrkie: compare your and mine
[07:26:56] <mrkie> Uhkis: thats almost what i want but the link text will not change at your version to hide source
[07:27:38] <Uhkis> mrkie: oh, i missed that part then
[07:27:53] <Uhkis> well add those lines back :)
[07:27:56] <mrkie> Uhkis: are you be able to give me that too your way?
[07:28:56] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/n4NqR/7/
[07:29:17] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/n4NqR/8/ actually
[07:29:18] <mrkie> Uhkis: your version will not automatic select the text sinde the textarea, it should do that :)
[07:30:13] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/n4NqR/9/ ?
[07:32:16] <mrkie> Uhkis: yeah that's fine, you have to click inside the textarea with my version before the text will be selected
[07:33:49] <tona> hello
[07:34:44] <mrkie> Uhkis: wht do you use  $('#source').select(); ?
[07:34:48] <mrkie> it works without it too
[07:35:01] <tona> i need jquery grid , there are many on internet but some works and another works could someone recommend me one one example
[07:35:15] <mrkie> i'm wrong, i missed something
[07:35:23] <mrkie> it does the selection part :)
[07:36:22] <mrkie> Uhkis: i see you don't work with return false :)
[07:49:18] <Vivekananda> so I am testing this but for now it seems that html things already present work well with click and hover but jquery generated appends are not getting that function. Could this be an issue with my system / apache or sth ?
[08:06:21] <Vivekananda> I think I saw an error but now not sure how to fix it . I have attached an on('click')/hover  to the jquery created li element coz .on('click/hover') was run on doc ready only. I believe I have to run it again so the new element also gets theon click functionality . how to do this ?
[08:10:37] <djam90> I wonder if anyone can help me here... I have Bootstrap 3 and I am using tabs, and I want the previous/next buttons to move through the tabs. I am trying to code it in JS/jQuery by looking for the currently active tab (it is the href of the a element) but on the click event it seems to show the previous tab and not the one I click on
[08:11:34] <djam90> This is my code http://pastebin.com/XTsyKafh
[08:18:15] <VectorX> djam90 might be faster if you made a example in jsfiddle
[08:30:03] <Vivekananda> How do I make sure that an onclick/onhover gets attached to a newly js generated li element with a certain class and I wish to attach the click/hover to be attached to al elements of that class ?
[08:38:05] <drager> Any idea how I can on click slide on div to the right (off screen) and hide it, then slide in another div from the left?

[08:59:40] <frank_9> no
[09:05:45] <drager> Any idea how I can on click slide on div to the right (off screen) and hide it, then slide in another div from the left?
[09:07:16] <Vivekananda> there is a slide for jquery

[09:20:36] <wiherek> hi
[09:22:21] <wiherek> i use jcarousel (cant really change that). i scale images inside with css max-width: 100% and height: auto
[09:22:44] <wiherek> and it works fine - after i resize the browser a bit. When they load, they get the wrong size
[09:23:57] <wiherek> is there a way I could reload the images?
[09:25:41] <lkjkljlk> Hi. Can anyone please give some pointers to good screencast and tutorials of how to jQuery?
[09:27:05] <djarico> wiherek
[09:27:16] <wiherek> yea i know thats a generic question :)
[09:27:29] <djarico> wiherek: you could just execute the same code on browser window resize
[09:27:45] <wiherek> yea, i do that... but thats not the problem
[09:27:58] <wiherek> when the script loads initially, that's where it breaks
[09:28:23] <_fox> oh, can you msg me a url or paste a tiny url
[09:29:31] <Vivekananda> trepmal: I am trying this https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/9037599  . in line 33 onwards I am trying to attach functionality to thegenerated new class elements butnot working.

[09:37:56] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I need some help figuring out the best way to select something. Here is the code: http://pastebin.com/bjDYxr4P I want to select the second input based on the first one (with a value of "_user_uploads" because the meta_key value might change on deployment).
[09:38:31] <jjb123> I thought about using regex to grab the "245" but I'm not sure if there's a better way to do it using "next" or something. Any thoughts?
[09:38:48] <djam90> Hey
[09:39:11] <djam90> What do you mean by "based on the first one"
[09:39:54] <djam90> You mean, the value of the second input is what you need, and is always the next sibling to _user_uploads?
[09:40:49] <djam90> jjb123, if you clarify I can help
[09:40:50] <jjb123> djam90: Yes, exactly. Except it's not a direct sibling because both fields are wrapped in a td.
[09:41:06] <djam90> ok cool, well you can do it like this:
[09:42:25] <djam90> 1 sec I will do it in jsfiddle
[09:42:40] <drager> Any idea how I can on click slide on div to the right (off screen) and hide it, then slide in another div from the left?
[09:42:49] <jjb123> djam90: Awesome, thanks!
[09:42:53] <drager> Basically I want to "shift" two elements
[09:43:06] <drager> slide them from different directions
[09:43:13] <drager> depending on onclick handler
[09:44:45] <h4k1m> hello guys
[09:45:08] <h4k1m> I know that it's preferred to put jquery script tag at the bottom of the body
[09:45:38] <drager> I have done this so far; https://dpaste.de/VYOZ It works (kinda) looks abit buggy though
[09:45:41] <jjb123> drager: http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions/ Here are some good examples, the "animate left" example will probably be the most useful because you'll probably want to change the elements position, not margin (so the new element can slide in it's place)
[09:45:42] <h4k1m> but what if I need to use jquery inside of a div
[09:45:43] <djam90> jjb123,  1 sec
[09:46:07] <drager> jjb123: Yeah, I've been looking at that. Hm
[09:47:04] <Pata> h4k1m, Can you explain what you mean by using jQuery inside of a div?
[09:47:24] <h4k1m> Pata, I mean that I m using a main layout.html
[09:47:37] <h4k1m> and I have different pages that uses this layout
[09:47:56] <jjb123> drager: Could you possibly put togethor a jsfiddle example so we can see how the animation is behaving?
[09:47:59] <h4k1m> so I need to use one feature of jquery only inside of one of its pages
[09:48:12] <drager> jjb123: Give me a minute
[09:48:21] <Pata> h4k1m, So you want to avoid loading jQuery on every page, and only include it on the ones where it's required?
[09:48:47] <h4k1m> Pata, that's almost right
[09:49:11] <h4k1m> Pata, do I have to put jquery inclusion (script tag) inside of the div needing it?
[09:49:42] <BillCriswell> h4k1m: Just include it before the </body> and use it wherever you like.
[09:50:00] <Pata> h4k1m I'd suggest you can either include jQuery on every page, or you use your back-end code to notify the layout.html that you want it, and it should include it
[09:50:21] <h4k1m> BillCrisweel, it needs to be declared before being used
[09:50:21] <Pata> h4k1m ( for example in my PHP I can do $view->require('jquery') )
[09:51:00] <Pata> Ah, h4k1m are you talking about using inline JavaScripts?
[09:51:01] <h4k1m> Pata, or I can put it in the head?
[09:51:12] <h4k1m> Pata, no
[09:51:34] <Pata> h4k1m Could you make an exmaple of what you mean, perhaps on jsfiddle.net
[09:51:55] <h4k1m> Pata, the code is a little bit long
[09:52:03] <Pata> Just a short sample will do
[09:52:09] <h4k1m> I have one main layout
[09:52:10] <Pata> To demonstrate the problem you're having
[09:52:17] <h4k1m> two views extends this main layout
[09:52:25] <h4k1m> I m using python (flask) btw
[09:52:42] <Pata> on www.jsfiddle.net please
[09:52:49] <h4k1m> ok Pata
[09:55:06] <djam90> jjb123 you ready?
[09:55:13] <jjb123> djam90: Yep, still here
[09:55:14] <djam90> useruploads = $("input[value='_user_uploads']");
[09:55:14] <djam90>         value_of_interest = useruploads.parent().next().children('input');
[09:55:40] <djam90> try that
[09:56:02] <Pata> slideUp() does not seem to be working in Firefox, but works fine in Chrome. Any ideas why?
[09:56:24] <drager> jjb123: http://jsfiddle.net/FtSUQ/
[09:56:30] <Pata> (Both the latest versions, and jQuery 2.1.0)
[09:56:47] <jjb123> djam90: Nice, works perfectly. Thanks!
[09:57:23] <djam90> ah wait
[09:57:26] <djam90> you need .val() on the end
[09:58:15] <djam90> to get the value
[09:58:19] <djam90> although that doesn't work for me
[10:00:38] <jjb123> drager: So you want the gray box to replace the red box (sliding in from the right)?
[10:02:33] <drager> jjb123: Yeah, but sliding in from the left
[10:02:41] <drager> and then when you want to shift them again
[10:02:46] <drager> from right to left
[10:02:55] <drager> If that makes sense
[10:06:17] <jjb123> drager: Ah, I see. Your best bet might just be to use a slideshow plugin like slidesjs or jssor, but here is a simple example I found that doesn't use any plugins: http://jsfiddle.net/e3m7K/2/
[10:07:50] <Vivekananda> HI everyone. struggling still and not sure what to do
[10:12:00] <drager> jjb123: Thanks, works kinda nice
[10:13:40] <drager> jjb123: Can I make it "slide in fading"?
[10:14:38] <drager> solved it
[10:57:36] <bumbar> is it possible to make a function block (ie wait) to achieve this https://dpaste.de/jYdw ?
[11:45:59] <coderego> what is the best jquery graph plugin?
[12:00:26] <V10Energy> did anybody use the jquery validation plugin? I am trying to use remote which works fine, except that it does a callback everytime i enter a character which can be a little heavy on the server. isn't there a way to make it send a request to the server after X amount of seconds? or even after the user TABs to the next field?
[12:01:50] <ryanneufeld> V10Energy: you should be able to change the onkeyup config
[12:02:15] <ryanneufeld> V10Energy: I assume you're using this one http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[12:02:40] <V10Energy> http://jqueryvalidation.org/ this is the same right?
[12:03:02] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:03:03] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation
[12:03:50] <V10Energy> ryanneufeld: thanks. but wouldn't it set onkeyup for all the fields?
[12:04:58] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate
[12:05:48] <ryanneufeld> onkeyup: false
[12:09:05] <V10Energy> ryanneufeld: yea but it sets it for all the fields. i need to make it for only the field that uses remote: true
[12:09:13] <V10Energy> remote*
[12:09:17] <ryanneufeld> why?
[12:09:28] <ryanneufeld> I would make the remote test on submit then
[12:10:13] <ryanneufeld> $(form).submit(function() { return: true // to allow submission});
[12:10:47] <V10Energy> ryanneufeld: for example, now i am experiencing issues with the onkeyup. after i enter the password and then confirm password fields, instead of pressing Tab, I press on submit, so it never actually validates the confirm_password
[12:11:14] <grafi> !ping
[12:11:14] <b-ot> grafi: pong!
[12:12:00] <V10Energy> n/m, must be another issues. thansk ryanneufeld

[12:13:14] <b-ot> V10Energy: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.

[13:51:09] <MDTech-us_MAN> Hello, I am using bxslider, but for some reason I have a huge amount of white space to the left of the photo. Code: http://www.mediafire.com/download/nvqweq58tgffvof/gallery_help.zip
[14:01:10] <Vivekananda> MDTech-us_MAN: seems noone isaround :(
[14:01:20] <Vivekananda> Aiden880: I am working on a similar problem myself
[14:01:28] <MDTech-us_MAN> what do you mean?
[14:03:12] <hooliogan132> MDTech-us_MAN have you checked out fluxsider and jFlow?
[14:04:25] <hooliogan132> they are the best of what is a comprehensive motely crew and some of them are great in principle but do have niggles.. just imo.. but I have tested fair few now
[14:07:31] <MDTech-us_MAN> does jFlow has auto hieght?
[14:34:05] <the8thbit> Hey
[14:35:18] <the8thbit> I want to use .hide() and .fadein(), not on an elm, but on the elements inside of a div (which I'm loading into the div)
[14:37:31] <Aiden880> I'd give each of the elements inside of the div their own id's, then inside of the function place kthe ids
[14:37:34] <Aiden880> the*
[14:37:37] <hooliogan132> MDTech-us_MAN yeah
[14:38:06] <hooliogan132> it does not automatically do it persay you need a little hack
[14:40:01] <hooliogan132> my images where all different heights but the same width
[14:40:59] <hooliogan132> so I you have to alterate a couple of its css files to force them to be the same height
[14:42:26] <hooliogan132> but yeah if your looking for something that will stretch the image to fit there is another one I cant think of its name now but its responsive and stetches the images as needed or not in same cases... give me a minutes i'll remember its name
[14:43:14] <hooliogan132> its not as good of a content slider tho where my impressions of it the way it was marked up was not for me ifirc
[14:43:36] * hooliogan132 taps his fingers on ChanServs skull trying to recall its name
[14:48:18] <hooliogan132> man its one of those things theres so many :)
[14:48:34] <hooliogan132> just found another one that looks super cool .. check out glide.js
[14:48:51] <hooliogan132> that goes straight into the sub zero section of the cool wall
[14:48:56] <the8thbit> Aiden880: I put all the elements into a big div in their own file, but I can't figure out how to hide/fade them, as that div is not inside the original html file
[14:50:16] <Aiden880> the8thbit, can you not add a <script> in the html file?
[14:50:40] <Aiden880> hooliogan132, http://dev7studios.com/plugins/nivo-slider/ Is very good
[14:50:44] <the8thbit> Aiden880: I mean, I have a js file associated with the html file I'm loading in that the html file looks at
[14:50:49] <the8thbit> but if I do something like
[14:51:07] <the8thbit> window.onload = function() { $( '#buttons' ).hide(); }
[14:51:09] <the8thbit> nothing happens
[14:51:25] <the8thbit> (and by nothing, I mean they don't get hidden)
[14:51:59] <hooliogan132> yeas very shinny Aiden880
[14:52:15] <the8thbit> oh, should it be document.load not window.load?
[14:53:00] <hooliogan132> oh now thats neat nivo has a back end ;)
[14:53:12] <hooliogan132> ah for wordpress
[14:55:00] <Aiden880> How come you're using window.onload?
[14:55:10] <Aiden880> Nono, you need:
[14:55:20] <Aiden880> Well, there are 3 methods, here are the best 2
[14:55:35] <Aiden880> 1: $( document ).ready(function() {
[14:55:44] <Aiden880> Or: $(function() {
[14:55:55] <Aiden880> The second one is quicker, but the first one offers more readability.
[14:57:44] <Aiden880> That's really the first part of jQuery, I'm surprised you didn't know it..
[15:00:55] <hooliogan132> hrm this wow slider thing wants to send me 17.8MB of crap
[15:23:31] <hooliogan123> wow slider bombed there ;D
[15:23:36] <hooliogan123> no random effect wtf man!
[15:23:57] <ShawnRisk> Is there a way to do a dissolve effect on text in jQuery?  I know I can do fade and am.
[15:30:26] <hooliogan123> fade()?
[15:36:35] <ShawnRisk> hooliogan123: fade is dissolve?
[15:37:07] <Vivekananda> still lesser peeps here
[15:46:30] <fractastical> n00b question: jQuery ajax call with timeout should only call every x number of milliseconds right?
[15:47:07] <igcewieling1> if I have an element, such as <input type="text" id="something"> how would I get the actual html of the element.   .html() will get the contents of an element, but now the actual element html.
[15:47:21] <fractastical> i.e. http://pastie.org/8740373
[15:47:43] <fractastical> because this seems to call it way faster
[15:49:43] <SocialEvil> http://jsfiddle.net/ALV5H/2/ guys i have this here, but my logic sux :D i want to change the text in "price" but only in the <div> where the .name:contains some text.. right now it changes every class on the page
[15:55:48] <jugglinmike> SocialEvil: var divs = $(".name:contains('some text')").parent();
[15:55:48] <jugglinmike> divs.find(".price").text("another price");
[15:57:37] <SocialEvil> sweet :) thanks jugglinmike
[15:58:56] <SocialEvil> now i hate myself i didnt figure out that myself :D not that i would.. but it just suprisingly not that complicated :D
[16:00:26] <tw2113> live and learn
[16:02:01] <jugglinmike> np
[16:19:06] <Tomashe> hey guys , there is a jqueyr mobile version that without all the ie6 code and stuff
[16:39:20] <linux_daemon> does anyone have skrill account?
[16:58:07] <coderego> Hey guys. Quick question: I am using Jquery to send in a form via ajax. There is a seperate section of the page that I would like to update the value of after the ajax posts. How do I do that?
[17:19:42] <the8thbit> Is there an equivalent to document.ready, but for html that is being loaded into a div?
[17:24:03] <pom_life> You guys know how some websites have image generation software? ie enter some information and an image is created?
[17:24:09] <pom_life> How is that usually accomplished?
[17:34:14] <coderego> Hey guys. Quick question: I am using Jquery to send in a form via ajax. There is a seperate section of the page that I would like to update the value of after the ajax posts. How do I do that?
[18:18:11] <zalem-developer> i hope someone can help
[18:19:05] <zalem-developer> i want to show a confirmation before a delete.  i want the message to say "Are you sure you want to delete <name of the submit button>"....
[19:02:12] <hooliogan132> hah how cool is that .. i have been working on this site and i noticed every now and again the slider would jump forward by itself i thought it must be some little bug i introduced .. so i just ignored it and elected to fix it later..
[19:02:27] <hooliogan132> but then i kept noticing it during a period where i was switching applications allot and I realized its the alt key every time you press the alt key the slider advances .. which is handy .. but i duno if its a bug or not now or part of the slider like a developer aid
[19:02:31] <hooliogan132> heh
[19:05:20] <hooliogan132> you actually have press alt twice so i am going to go for it being a developer aid
[19:05:55] <hooliogan132> or is it chromes inspectors hot key to tigger all timers or some such
[19:05:56] <hooliogan132> hmmm
[19:51:37] <hooliogan132> ah gd bless you jquery devs for .hide("slow"); ::)
[20:03:51] <curvedmark> I noticed that jquery is written in amd, and upon building, definitions are unwrapped and all dumped into a single closure, which means local variables in different modules actually share the same scope. I wonder how jquery team makes sure there are no name collisions? Do they keep a list of used local variable names that whenever they need to use a new local variable, the list need to be checked first?
[20:11:52] <aaron1245> Anyone a deferred expert? :)
[20:16:43] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me why and how to fix the background jumping when you first click the open button for the nav. It seems like the "right" style is being applied before the css animation? So it's jumping instead on animating? - http://jsfiddle.net/xL2BP/
[20:19:46] <d3m0n> Even when I apply the transition straight to the elements it still jumps: http://jsfiddle.net/xL2BP/1/
[21:14:33] <Okaria> @d3m0n It's probably because you aren't defining the .site element's initial 'right' value. By default the value isn't actually 0 to the browser, it's an abstract 'auto' value. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/mBhFL/
[21:19:39] <krz> so do i select an element with name=foo[bar] ?
[21:19:48] <krz> input element
[21:23:24] <krz> Corey: i forget about the solution you gave me last week
[21:23:28] <krz> could you repost
[21:23:31] <systemfault> You prefix the square brackets with 2 backslashes
[21:23:49] <Okaria> i.e. $('input[name=foo\\[bar\\]]')
[21:23:50] <systemfault> But.. you should never select elements based off their name attribute.
[21:24:08] <systemfault> Okaria: Yeah... with one less ]
[21:24:08] <krz> thats an ugly way of doing it
[21:24:40] <aaron1245> Does anyone have any advice on firing a function after a function is done running which contains an each loop where inside that loop it contains an ajax request?
[21:24:51] <krz> theres a much cleaner solution. systemfault why *never*?
[21:25:45] <systemfault> krz: Because the name attributes should be considered off limit, they belong to the backend world.
[21:25:55] <krz> what?!
[21:26:00] <krz> lol
[21:26:17] <krz> ill pretend i didnt readthat
[21:26:21] <krz> read that*
[21:26:48] <systemfault> Pretend whatever you want, bob.
[21:30:52] <d3m0n> Wow Okaria, thanks! I would've never figured that out
[21:31:14] <d3m0n> That's interesting it does that.
[21:31:37] <krz> so if im doing an API call and need to write the value to an input element, after the API call is successfully completed. you suggest i shouldnt select elements based off their name attribute?
[21:31:46] <krz> bit silly imo
[21:31:58] <krz> really dont see anything wrong with this approach, BOB
[21:35:19] <systemfault> krz: It's not about that.... if the backend dev changes the name of a field in his DTO, you'll have to change yours on the frontend. So you basically style your HTML based off the decision of your backend dev.
[21:35:30] <systemfault> Anyway... it's not really worth aguing.
[21:35:36] <systemfault> arguing even
[21:38:22] <krz> if the backend dev changes the name of the field in the backend (db), itll most likely change on the frontend anyways. thats assuming the name was the same to begin with, in the back and front
[21:39:22] <krz> and its krz not bob
[21:40:16] <aaron1245> thats just adding to his argument about not styling to name properties
[21:41:52] <krz> even if there was a name change. the change isnt going to be catastrophic. itll be bearable. but certainly does not deserve the *never* approach
[21:45:09] <sacho> aaron1245, use the promises from the ajax requests and $.when() to synchronize them
[21:46:04] <systemfault> sacho++
[21:46:49] <aaron1245> So I have around 50 ajax requests in that each loop
[21:47:04] <systemfault> aaron1245: Oh shit, why so many?
[21:47:05] <aaron1245> do i start a new deferred in every loop
[21:47:16] <sacho> why would you
[21:47:18] <aaron1245> well, technically this is a cordova/phonegap app
[21:47:24] <systemfault> aaron1245: Are the calls serial or must be in parallel?
[21:47:26] <aaron1245> it's a file download and sycing off a server
[21:47:40] <aaron1245> syncing*
[21:47:49] <aaron1245> they can download in whatever order they want, doesn't matter
[21:47:56] <aaron1245> i just need to know when they're all done download
[21:48:13] <aaron1245> if a download succeeds, I have a callback i can place a deferred resolve in
[21:48:18] <systemfault> Then you can use $.map and $.when (Like sacho  suggested)
[21:48:21] <aaron1245> i'm just not 100% on how this works with an each loop
[21:48:55] <sacho> aaron1245, jquery's $.ajax() returns a promise
[21:49:04] <aaron1245> yeah
[21:49:14] <aaron1245> let me go back on that
[21:49:20] <aaron1245> the file download API isn't an ajax request technically
[21:49:25] <aaron1245> but i know how to return a promise
[21:49:39] <aaron1245> i just don't know how to tell when *all* the downloads are complete
[21:49:50] <sacho> so function ajaxCalls() { return $.when(YourAjaxCalls); }.done(function () { // all of them are done! })
[21:49:53] <systemfault> aaron1245: That's where $.when rocks
[21:50:35] <systemfault> Or $.when.apply if you have an array of promises
[21:50:40] <aaron1245> let me digest that for a sec :)
[21:50:55] <aaron1245> somewhat new to promise
[21:51:37] <sacho> aaron1245, $.when() accepts multiple promises and returns a promise(or was it a deferred) that is resolved only when all the promises you passed to it are
[21:52:54] * sacho wonders why the hell $.when() accepts deferreds
[21:53:17] <aaron1245> let me make a fiddle quick
[21:54:35] <ryanneufeld> sacho: well, $.when(thisPromiseIsFulfilled, andThisonetoo).then(function(){//for first one}, function(){//for second})
[21:55:49] <sacho> ryanneufeld, ok..?
[21:56:08] <tw2113> sup neufeld?
[21:56:33] <sacho> not sure what your point is
[22:00:29] <systemfault> sacho: It accepts them simply because a functionalities of a promise is a subset of those of a deferred.
[22:00:34] <aaron1245> ok here is a fiddle
[22:00:35] <aaron1245> http://jsfiddle.net/U6wgU/
[22:00:43] <sacho> systemfault, you'd think it'd accept a promise, then.
[22:00:55] <systemfault> $when accepts promises
[22:01:10] <sacho> I know it does. I'm talking about the documentation.
[22:01:16] <systemfault> Ahhh ok
[22:04:08] <systemfault> aaron1245: I'll write you an example... The promise implementation of jquery is a bit bad though.
[22:04:09] <sacho> aaron1245, http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/
[22:04:51] <systemfault> Oh
[22:05:21] <systemfault> sacho is a machine :D
[22:06:15] <systemfault> The thing is... what happens if one of the 50 calls fails :P
[22:06:30] <systemfault> Most promise libs have a "allSettled" or something similar..
[22:06:53] <aaron1245> if the download fails or the file doesn't exist, it shouldn't fail it
[22:07:00] <aaron1245> really all i need is to make sure the successes are done
[22:07:06] <aaron1245> then run something
[22:07:23] <aaron1245> let me try to figure out this code, sacho
[22:07:49] <sacho> you should use .always, then
[22:07:55] <sacho> instead of .done
[22:08:02] <aaron1245> oh yes
[22:08:06] <aaron1245> thats right
[22:08:09] <systemfault> Would that work?
[22:08:16] <sacho> hmm
[22:08:20] * sacho checks what $.when does
[22:08:21] <systemfault> How do you know if a promise failed ?
[22:08:38] <systemfault> Ah... I guess you need to return success no matter what
[22:08:41] <sacho> when it's rejected
[22:09:00] <sacho> that won't work
[22:09:08] <sacho> you'd need a $.always similar to $.when
[22:09:14] <sacho> I'm not sure when $.ajax fails though
[22:09:16] <sacho> it might be a nonissue
[22:09:30] <sacho> I think it's still a success as long as the server returns something
[22:09:52] <sacho> it's a fail on I guess timeouts and cross-origin blocks
[22:12:14] <aaron1245> so in your example referenced with mine, make_some_calls would be the fileSync function and ajax() would be loopFiles
[22:12:46] <aaron1245> but where is the each loop?
[22:13:42] <sacho> your each loop is irrelevant, as long as you collect all the promises you get from the ajax requests from it
[22:13:58] <sacho> that's what make_some_calls() does
[22:15:11] <sacho> so in your case, var promises = []; $.each(function () { //do stuff promises.push($.ajax()); }); return promises
[22:17:21] <aaron1245> hmm k, let me think about all this
[22:20:19] <systemfault> Can you recover from a failure with the jQuery implementation of promises?
[22:21:50] <aaron1245> In the ajax() function, should the return be return def or return def.promise()?
[22:22:37] <systemfault> It can be both... but only "promise()" is the good way.
[22:23:09] <systemfault> Because the promise doesn't have (.resolve/.reject)
[22:23:40] <aaron1245> ok so i'll try def.promise()
[22:24:02] <sacho> systemfault, what do you mean? promises have a then(resolvedCallback, rejectedCallback)
[22:24:20] <sacho> aaron1245, you shouldn't be creating new deferreds at all
[22:24:27] <sacho> $.ajax does that for you
[22:24:42] <systemfault> sacho: Good promise implementation allow you to recover from failure
[22:24:51] <aaron1245> sorry, i'm not doing ajax requests, i'm doing file downloads to devices using cordova
[22:25:01] <aaron1245> cordova/phonegap
[22:25:16] <sacho> okay
[22:27:34] <systemfault> sacho: You can http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/1/
[22:28:13] <systemfault> Not as good as a "allSettled" function though..
[22:28:24] <sacho> I don't know what allSettled means
[22:28:42] <sacho> would it be exactly the thing aaron is looking for? if so, yeah
[22:29:15] <sacho> there just needs to be a $.all()
[22:29:39] <sacho> maybe with a timeout so it has a failure state
[22:37:10] <systemfault> That's sooo weird.
[22:37:26] <systemfault> .fail doesn't work the way it should :(
[22:40:24] <Velveeta> how do you mean?
[22:40:42] <systemfault> Well, .then works the way I expect... See: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/2/
[22:41:02] <aaron1245> so essentially you're creating an array of promises and using when to wait for them all to be resolved....and then executing a function
[22:41:25] <systemfault> Velveeta: But if you replace .then with a normal "fail", you cannot recover
[22:43:04] <Velveeta> i don't understand why you're returning a $.when() of an object in createUser()
[22:43:29] <systemfault> I was just testing :(
[22:43:50] <systemfault> But basically, I really care about line 23 and after
[22:44:09] <Velveeta> you should have your getCurrentUser(), rather than rejecting, using the else fork to call createUser()
[22:45:07] <systemfault> In my test, getCurrentUser() and createUser are dummy ajax calls.
[22:45:14] <Velveeta> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/3/
[22:45:18] <systemfault> I was just testing the promises system
[22:45:27] <Velveeta> gotcha
[22:46:04] <systemfault> I'm doing a lot of node.js these days and I'm use to better promise libs like Q and bluebird
[22:46:10] <systemfault> *used
[22:47:02] <cem_> hi in jquery is there way to detect '?' in textarea
[22:47:37] <Uhkis> regular string.match should do it
[22:47:46] <pom_life> yes
[22:47:49] <systemfault> Well.. depends on what you're looking for, do you want to check every keypress? Or you just need to check once
[22:47:52] <Velveeta> systemfault: something like this should work with an ajax implementation: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/4/
[22:48:05] <pom_life> Velveeta: Good evening!
[22:48:13] <Velveeta> pom_life: hello hello
[22:48:31] <pom_life> Velveeta: Did you enjoy your weekend?
[22:48:46] <systemfault> Velveeta: It wouldn't, because the server would send a 404 and that would call .fail/.then(null, handler)
[22:48:52] <Velveeta> pom_life: yeah it was alright, finally wrapped up my latest blog post, it'll post in the morning
[22:49:05] <systemfault> Velveeta: You're blogging?
[22:49:08] <pom_life> Velveeta: Shoot me a link and I'll check it out.
[22:49:17] <Velveeta> systemfault: gotcha, so this is set up more restful, in that case, have your ajax fail call createUser also
[22:49:27] <Velveeta> and yeah, i have a tech blog out there
[22:49:37] <systemfault> Velveeta: Gimme
[22:50:02] <systemfault> Unless it's a blog dedicated to your cat.
[22:50:03] <Velveeta> systemfault: so something more like this: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/5/
[22:50:53] <pom_life> Velveeta: Also, if I'm displaying a countdown timer on a web page, should I use a div with a p tag in it as the background for the numbers, or an <input text=""> element?
[22:51:00] <Velveeta> oh yeah, forgot to update createUser to reflect the promise return: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/6/
[22:51:33] <systemfault> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/mJe54/7/
[22:51:35] <Velveeta> pom_life: i'm not quite sure how to picture what you're asking
[22:51:53] <pom_life> Imagine a timer ---> 0:00:00
[22:52:12] <pom_life> Should it be a text element on top of a div, or should it be a text input disabled?
[22:52:50] <Velveeta> i would probably just make it a span
[22:52:59] <Uhkis> go normal text
[22:53:06] <pom_life> In Firefox, text inputs tend to store integers
[22:53:11] <pom_life> normal text you say?
[22:53:19] <pom_life> and parseInt the text
[22:53:40] <pom_life> and adjust the result every minute, second and millisecond
[22:53:41] <Uhkis> text looks nicer than an input box
[22:53:46] <Velveeta> systemfault: so the only problem you'll have with that setup is that you're returning the ajax's promise from getCurrentUser(), which means that pass or fail, you're gonna trigger the .then() on that call
[22:53:54] <Uhkis> and only difference is val() or text()
[22:54:15] <Velveeta> you want to return your own deferred promise that you can resolve when you choose, whether during the original ajax success, or after a 2nd ajax success that you call to createUser()
[22:54:35] <pom_life> Uhkis: I like the look of the counter on this deal, though. http://winningfundraising.net/Chromatica/game.html
[22:54:41] <pom_life> Do you not like the look?
[22:55:19] <Velveeta> you can make any container look like that though
[22:55:44] <Velveeta> i'd argue that semantically, a span is more appropriate to display that, unless you're actually using it as form data for submission
[22:55:54] <pom_life> I know... is there an advantage to using .text or .value, though?
[22:56:06] <Velveeta> not to my knowledge
[22:56:16] <pom_life> Okay, in that case the span would probably make sense.
[22:56:24] <pom_life> Is it good practice to avoid overusing divs?
[22:56:41] <Velveeta> i would say it's good practice to avoid overusing any tags
[22:56:49] <Velveeta> but only you can determine what "overuse" means
[22:56:51] <pom_life> Hm.
[22:56:57] <systemfault> pom_life: The good practice is to use the semantic html :P
[22:57:14] <systemfault> Some people care... other not.
[22:57:19] <pom_life> Would you mind peeking at the source on that game? I'll post a link to it.
[22:57:20] <Velveeta> take a look at the dom on gmail... for being a google product, i was surprised to see they div *everything*
[22:57:57] <systemfault> Google are hypocrites.
[22:58:04] <Velveeta> oh yeah, and as for my blog, since a couple of you asked a few minutes ago, if you have twitter, you can follow me at this name, and it automatically blasts when a new post goes up
[22:58:14] <systemfault> Just look at the google.com source..
[22:58:32] <systemfault> They don't care about best practices :P
[22:58:39] <Velveeta> well, google has a pretty enormous browser support matrix, so i can understand why they don't use more semantic tags from html5
[22:59:12] <Velveeta> that doesn't mean they can't preach best practices where it can be gotten away with, like in their polymer and angular products
[22:59:37] <systemfault> polymer... good luck with that google.
[22:59:38] <pom_life> Can you theoretically write a parse to dissect that code on the homepage into readable chunks?
[22:59:58] <systemfault> Apple just said FU to Google by removing the shadow dom support from safari
[23:00:33] <systemfault> So much for polymer.
[23:02:05] <pom_life> Would you say coding a small project in procedural programming and then paradigm-translate it to Object Oriented when initially getting a solid foundation would be a worthwhile exercise?
[23:02:18] <Velveeta> why the fuck would apple remove support for shadow dom?
[23:02:47] <Velveeta> pom_life: exercise in what, wrapping your head around OOP?
[23:02:55] <systemfault> Velveeta: I don't know... Could be because Google said FU to Apple about CSS Regions
[23:02:56] <systemfault> :P
[23:03:00] <systemfault> Browser wars!
[23:03:17] <Velveeta> well if that's the case, apple's handicapping themselves since shadow dom is on its way to being ratified
[23:03:33] <Velveeta> not that it would be the first time
[23:03:39] <systemfault> Velveeta: To me, it means that it will probably never become used
[23:03:44] <systemfault> (Shadow DOM)
[23:03:50] <Velveeta> i can guarantee that's not gonna slow down the web components roll out
[23:03:59] <systemfault> I hope you're right
[23:04:04] <Velveeta> false, it means it'll never become used on ios devices
[23:04:26] <pom_life> I think I know about what makes OOP so great. You basically imagine your problem as a bunch of different things, and you write up how those things interact with eachother. For example, an ATMMachine(); object would accept a DebitCard(); object. ATMMachine would have method acceptCard();, checkBalance();, etc.
[23:05:19] <systemfault> pom_life: JS OOP isn't "industry-standard OOP" though
[23:05:25] <Velveeta> pom_life: also, as far as writing a parser to break up that source into readable chunks, are you just talking about making it pretty so it's easier to wade through w/ your eyeballs?
[23:05:30] <pom_life> I think I know about prototyping, too.
[23:05:50] <Velveeta> there are prettifiers out there on the web already, you can just paste a big hunk of html into it and it'll line it all out for you nice and neatly
[23:05:56] <pom_life> You have an Object with certain properties and methods, and you prototype individual objects with different methods and properties if need be
[23:06:12] <pom_life> it's like a tree - Object -> prototype.function(){}
[23:06:39] <pom_life> Velveeta: Is there one of those you'd recommend?
[23:07:16] <Velveeta> i don't have any one that i use, i just google "html beautifier" and check out the first couple, and just use whichever one works best and easiest
[23:09:53] <pom_life> Velveeta: Glancing over this, is this what OOP looks like when executed properly? -->http://pastebin.com/sA0v9QYT
[23:12:05] <Velveeta> so, there's no one way to write "OOP"... what you show in this pastebin is one way of using it, but aside from just creating collections of properties and methods inside of object containers like that, you should do some reason up on design patterns also
[23:12:42] <Velveeta> one of the best resources for that in the js world is addy osmasni's book about js design patterns: http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[23:12:52] <pom_life> Excellent, a recommendation
[23:13:13] <Velveeta> it'll teach you different implementation strategies for different use cases, why some are better suited to tasks than others, the tradeoffs made between different methods, etc
[23:14:01] <Velveeta> i'm a huge advocate of learning patterns over languages... patterns are transferrable from language to language, and once you learn how to properly structure your code, languages are literally just learning the syntactical rules and library functions
[23:14:22] <systemfault> Velveeta: I found most OOP patterns to be non-transferable to JS :P
[23:14:23] <Velveeta> but you can write scalable code in any language if you learn the proper patterns for how to implement things in the right way
[23:14:46] <Velveeta> systemfault: that's not correct at all, nearly every single pattern i've encountered in any language is absolutely transferrable to js
[23:14:46] <tw2113> Velveeta wants to make you SOLID
[23:14:59] <systemfault> I know SOLID :P
[23:15:13] <systemfault> Good luck with the  LI in JS
[23:15:36] <systemfault> In JS, SOD would work :/
[23:16:49] <tw2113> it still mostly throws me for a loop
[23:17:05] <tw2113> but most of my coding is still php
[23:17:21] <Velveeta> i don't understand what's so difficult about the LI portions in javascript
[23:17:38] <systemfault> Most PHP programmers will never get at a level where they could comprehend the SOLID principles
[23:17:53] <Velveeta> you can easily swap out functionally-equivalent interfaces in code in js, it's done all the time in polymorphic code
[23:18:49] <systemfault> Velveeta: Personally.. I think those principles were defined for more.... classic statically typed languages like C++ and Java.
[23:18:51] <Velveeta> and as far as client-specific interfaces, that's what composition is for, tailoring modules to their respective consumers and exposing appropriate interfaces
[23:19:09] <Velveeta> they may have been *defined* for those, but that doesn't mean they don't translate to javascript also
[23:19:28] <systemfault> In JS, you would need something like interfaces in typescript to make the I work nicely.
[23:19:43] <Velveeta> i actually prefer javascript's prototypal inheritance model to more traditional languages, as the resource footprint is much smaller
[23:20:10] <Velveeta> you can manage your own interfaces just fine, you don't need typescript to enforce them for you
[23:20:22] <Velveeta> it's obviously easier if the compiler flags issues for you
[23:20:27] <systemfault> I _want_ my compiler to enforce them for me.
[23:20:29] <systemfault> Right.
[23:20:31] <Velveeta> right
[23:20:52] <Velveeta> but that doesn't mean the L isn't there
[23:21:02] <tw2113> i always strive to not be the person that gets used in php examples of what not to do
[23:21:07] <systemfault> Velveeta: What do you think of the class syntax of ES6?
[23:21:09] <Velveeta> lol
[23:21:12] <Velveeta> @tw
[23:21:38] <Velveeta> i haven't done a huge amount of reading into ES6 class syntax yet, i've been mostly reading up on generators and weakmaps and whatnot so far
[23:21:49] <systemfault> generators = <3
[23:22:21] <Velveeta> i can't wait for easy-to-use monads
[23:22:41] <systemfault> In a dynamically-typed language?!
[23:22:42] <Velveeta> because i'm so tired of having to do: if (a && a.b && a.b.c && a.b.c.d) { a.b.c.d(); }
[23:23:05] <systemfault> Yeah.. that sucks
[23:24:02] <Velveeta> i should've been in bed 2 hours ago
[23:24:09] <Velveeta> but we can't stop watching house of cards
[23:24:09] <systemfault> Same...
[23:24:18] <systemfault> My sleep pattern is going to hell these days
[23:24:44] <Velveeta> fortunately i have today off
[23:25:12] <tw2113> i have tomorrow off, but i'll probably try to wake up at the same time i would anyway
[23:25:34] <Velveeta> i have to be up in about 5 hours to take my kid to school
[23:26:02] <Velveeta> and then the wife and i have a movie date slated either for late morning or early afternoon, to watch "ride along"
[23:26:21] <tw2113> not the Lego Movie?
[23:26:24] <tw2113> do you hate your wife?
[23:26:27] <Velveeta> watched that today actually
[23:26:29] <Velveeta> in 3d :D
[23:26:33] <tw2113> without her?
[23:26:36] <tw2113> do you hate your wife?
[23:26:38] <Velveeta> nah, w/ her and the kid
[23:26:44] <tw2113> oh in that case, nevermind
[23:26:46] <Velveeta> because i hate my wife
[23:26:52] <Velveeta> er yeah, i mean uh, nevermind
[23:27:30] <tw2113> i'm still plowing my way through WWF prowrestling circa 1997
[23:27:44] <Velveeta> TYYYPHOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
[23:28:03] <tw2113> he wasn't around
[23:28:14] <Velveeta> undertaker?
[23:28:16] <tw2113> yes
[23:28:19] <Velveeta> woo hoo!
[23:28:26] <Velveeta> hacksaw jim duggan?
[23:28:30] <tw2113> no
[23:28:32] <Velveeta> boo
[23:28:34] <tw2113> he was in WCW
[23:28:53] <tw2113> if you remember the Montreal Screw Job, this is the year it took place
[23:28:56] <Velveeta> all of my old wrestling knowledge rotted from the time i stopped watching when i was like 13 :D
[23:29:10] <tw2113> how old are you now?
[23:29:14] <Velveeta> 35
[23:29:31] <tw2113> so it's been 22 years
[23:29:46] <Velveeta> roughly, yeah, i just threw out the number 13, but it was probably right around then
[23:29:54] <tw2113> yeah you stopped watching in the early 90s
[23:30:03] <Velveeta> rightio
[23:30:10] <tw2113> i'm in the mid-late 90s
[23:30:24] <Velveeta> i'll tell you who's still one of my heros though, andre the giant
[23:30:32] <Velveeta> and not for his wrestling career... for his liver
[23:30:45] <Velveeta> http://www.drunkard.com/issues/10_06/10_06_andre_giant.html
[23:31:16] <Velveeta> that man's alcoholic legerdemain was unparalleled
[23:31:31] <tw2113> pretty much
[23:33:14] <Velveeta> "You won’t find it in the Guinness Book of World Records, but Andre the Giant holds the world record for the largest number of beers consumed in a single sitting. These were standard 12-ounce bottles of beer, nothing fancy, but during a six-hour period Andre drank 119 of them. It was one of the few times Andre got drunk enough to pass out, which he did in a hallway at his hotel."
[23:38:14] <tw2113> and they couldn't move him
[23:38:18] <tw2113> they had to wait for him to come to
[23:41:12] <Velveeta> yeah, they threw a piano cover over him to hide him :D
[23:46:48] <snollux> Any idea why nothing seems to happen when I do submit with prevent default? http://jsfiddle.net/jV6B8/ -- It seems like it should display "submitted!" in the alert
[23:47:24] <snollux> taking out the function callback, and letting it just be .submit(), works fine
[23:47:57] <Cork> snollux: submit fires when you submit the form
[23:47:57] <systemfault> snollux: I can see the alert
[23:48:07] <Cork> toggling the input doesn't cause a submit
[23:48:42] <snollux> systemfault: really.. I'm on OSX chrome Version 32.0.1700.107
[23:48:48] <Cork> and depending on the browser enter MIGHT work
[23:49:02] <Cork> but ex. ie demands a submit button to submit a form
[23:49:10] <systemfault> snollux: OSX Chrome 32 here... It works when I press enter
[23:49:23] <snollux> oh, ok. I wanted it to just automatically submit the form
[23:49:27] <snollux> without user input
[23:49:55] <Cork> snollux: $('#my_number').on('input', function() { $(this).closest('form').submit(); });
[23:50:28] <snollux> what does the .on('input') mean?
[23:50:30] <Cork> but again, you should have a submit button
