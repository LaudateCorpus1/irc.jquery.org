[02:46:45] <mokos> Hello, how do you unwrap elements that are only inside another element ?
[02:46:50] <mokos> another specific element
[02:51:58] <Woet> mokos: I don't get your question.
[02:52:49] <mokos> Woet: Not sure what you mean, I can do $('span').unwrap(); but I only want to do it for span inside an <a>
[02:52:57] <Woet> mokos: so change your selector?
[02:55:16] <mokos> Woet: if I do a span to remove the span inside the a, the a is also unwrapped
[02:55:58] <mokos> Woet: how can I remove the span only inside links ? (a)
[02:56:02] <mokos> Woet: unwrap I mean
[02:56:22] <Woet> mokos: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[02:57:17] <Woet> mokos: remember, unwrap is to get rid of the parent element.
[02:57:37] <Woet> mokos: so <a><span></span></a>, if you unwrap span, you get rid of the parent (<a> in this case)
[02:57:58] <mokos> mokos: I want to only strip the span
[02:58:07] <mokos> Woet: *
[02:58:16] <Woet> mokos: then why are you using unwrap?
[02:58:27] <Woet> mokos: https://api.jquery.com/unwrap/ - "The .unwrap() method removes the element's parent."
[02:58:29] <mokos> Woet: because If I did span.unwrap it would remove the span
[02:58:41] <Woet> mokos: no, it would not.
[02:58:45] <mokos> Woet: yes it would
[02:58:53] <Woet> [15:56:22]  <Woet>	mokos: show your test case on www.jsfiddle.net
[02:59:03] <mokos> Woet: https://jsfiddle.net/
[02:59:08] <mokos> Woet: lol wait
[02:59:20] <mokos> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Ecsyzbgxx2
[03:00:45] <Woet> mokos: i'm there, ping me when you're demonstrating your point
[03:00:51] <Woet> the "If I did span.unwrap it would remove the span"
[03:01:27] <Woet> mokos: I know I'm right because I'm simply repeating the documentation :)
[03:01:33] <mokos> haha
[03:02:02] <mokos> so what can I do to strip just the span inside an a ?
[03:02:17] <Woet> mokos: if theres no element inside the span, you'll need to do something like element.replaceWith(element.html());
[03:05:15] <mokos> Woet: I did that but it's copying the element 5 times instead of one
[03:08:00] <mokos> Woet:     $( "a > span" ).replaceWith( $('span').html() );
[03:11:10] <Woet> mokos: you'll need to use a loop if theres multiple elements
[03:18:51] <mokos> Woet: I have no idea how to tackle this
[04:49:18] <WhirledPress> when trying to determine if an element is within the visible bounds of a scrollable parent, should you compare offset()'s of the two elements or .position()'s?
[05:50:02] <sine0> hey folks. I have an issue where I am using slick slider and have put 'wow fadeIn' on the slide text divs. the first one works however the other slides dont have the wow effect, because I assume the time has passed or they have already loaded all at the same time in the background. is there a way of halting the animate/wow to when it comes in focus
[05:58:59] <WhirledPress> sine0, you are prolly gonna need to talk to the authors of that slider.

[17:31:28] <geotheory> Anyone there?
[17:53:23] <ngharo> geotheory: i'm not familiar with that plugin but you call $('#countries').selectize(...) twice.  Why?
[17:54:04] <ngharo> the examples show a similar usecase (fetching remote data) and only call the plugin once
[18:03:01] <geotheory> ngharo: Ah well spotted, looks like I forgot to cut the on load bit when I rejigged the code. It doesn't make any difference removing it however. I still get the same problem
[18:03:38] <geotheory> Have update SO question though..
[18:05:40] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/9em6cgtL/
[18:05:43] <ngharo> this seems to work
[18:05:56] <ngharo> searchField was missing from your options
[18:09:33] <ngharo> but in general, you should be looking at your console and checking to see if your ajax call to countries.json is happening or not, and if it's returning what you expect
[18:09:38] <geotheory> ngharo: Sorry unless this is a browser/Mac related issue, your jsfiddle behaves just as my code example does - the dropdown options are only offered once you've first typed something in. I want the options to appear when you first click in the field - as a dropdown box should work.
[18:11:11] <ngharo> I would probably just provide the data from countries.json directly to the `options` option then
[18:11:27] <geotheory> You're right about checking console. With my example the GET call only happens **after** you type something..
[18:14:46] <ngharo> geotheory: https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/usage.md
[18:14:52] <ngharo> I think you want the 'preload' option set
[18:16:19] <geotheory> I tried that earlier. No effect, nor with your example https://jsfiddle.net/geotheory/9em6cgtL/2/
[18:17:13] <ngharo> yah, in theory, hmm. Seems like a bug to selectize bug to me.
[18:18:23] <geotheory> I think that `if (!query.length) return callback();` is causing problem. As I read it this means if query is empty string AJAX won't trigger
[18:18:49] <geotheory> But if I cange to `if (true) return callback();` the code does nothing
[18:20:07] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/9em6cgtL/3/ you could always just wrap it inside the ajax success callback
[18:21:31] <ngharo> but in this case, I would just add the array of countries directly to your script instead of calling for it
[18:21:46] <geotheory> Ahhhh!!!
[18:22:00] <geotheory> Nice work. Didn't think of that
[18:22:14] <geotheory> Happy New Year
[18:22:20] <ngharo> cheers
