[00:00:47] <ducky_> pallet: there are stuff wrong with that one. first of all, you have to register for it which i dont like. and second of all, you don't get the script, you just get the embed thing, i need whole script so i can edit it.
[00:00:52] <ducky_> pallet: is there a js fiddle one?
[00:01:28] <nVee> morning guys, can someone perhaps tell me how I can iterate through all form elements in a selected form?
[00:01:50] <nVee> Obviously, not just input but also select, textarea etc
[00:02:09] <rakl> hey all, I'm trying to hide all elements of a certain type and toggle the hide/show of the one that was clicked. Why is this not working: http://pastie.org/6036457
[00:03:21] <rakl> if I fire the same click event on the same 'expand' element over and over, it just keeps expand the element instead of hiding it if it's already expanded
[00:03:48] <Cork> rakl: you should not use id's as classes
[00:03:57] <Trisox> Cork: o/
[00:04:00] <Cork> add a class for that; its what they are for
[00:04:04] <Trisox> \o/
[00:04:34] <rakl> is that what's causing this behavior or is there som logic mistake in my code?
[00:04:42] <rakl> i'll try classes thoug
[00:05:30] <Cork> not really sure
[00:05:38] <Cork> i know your doing lots of unsafe things there though
[00:05:39] <BinaryKitten> is that coffeescript? or just pseudocode?
[00:05:43] <rakl> coffee
[00:05:48] <Cork> for i in jquery object, isn't safe
[00:05:52] <Cork> use .each
[00:06:17] <BinaryKitten> also that whole loop is pointless
[00:06:27] <BinaryKitten> since all the elements have already been hidden
[00:06:31] <Cork> or do infos.hasOwnProperty(i)
[00:07:11] <Cork> though i'm not sure even that is safe
[00:07:18] <BinaryKitten> rakl can you pastebin the JS code that the coffeescript snippet you've pastebinned creates
[00:07:23] <Cork> as there are functions on the jquery object you could count
[00:07:34] <rakl> wait lol, that .hide() when I first assign infos...
[00:07:37] * Cork nods
[00:07:45] <rakl> where did that come from
[00:07:52] <rakl> does that hide all elements in the array?
[00:08:02] <Cork> yes
[00:08:02] <BinaryKitten> infos isn't an array
[00:08:03] <rakl> i mean, can you call .hide() on a list of elements?
[00:08:11] <Cork> its a jquery object
[00:08:22] <rakl> it's a list of jquery objects no?
[00:08:28] <Cork> no
[00:08:35] <mazzachre> Hmmm... jsfiddle now don't work in IE8... Or rather, there are no icons... otherwise it works, so guess a function :D
[00:08:35] <Cork> its a jquery object containing dom elements
[00:08:38] <BinaryKitten> and yes, calling hide on a jQuery object will hide the contents of the object
[00:08:43] <rakl> oh i see
[00:09:11] <Cork> mazzachre: actually the old jsfiddle worked even worse in ie8
[00:09:13] <BinaryKitten> jQuery uses an array internally and allows you to iterate over it (as you can with all objects in JS)
[00:09:31] <Cork> BinaryKitten: actually its not an array internally
[00:09:35] <Cork> its an array "like" object
[00:09:46] <BinaryKitten> but itself is an object no matter whether you select 1 element or many elements
[00:09:53] <mazzachre> Cork: Oh, I never used it much... Unfortunately organization here supports IE8...
[00:10:08] <BinaryKitten> Cork last time i looked there was an array used... might have changed that in the newer versions
[00:10:23] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 0: 'hello', 1: 'world', length: 2 };
[00:10:32] <Cork> ?eval var a = { 0: 'hello', 1: 'world', length: 2 }; a
[00:10:40] <Cork> bah the bot is dead
[00:10:43] <BinaryKitten> heh
[00:10:49] <Cork> js> var a = { 0: 'hello', 1: 'world', length: 2 }; print(a)
[00:10:51] <b-ot> Cork: [object Object]
[00:10:52] <BinaryKitten> you killed it with too much evil
[00:11:39] <Cork> BinaryKitten: but, ya i have a memory of it being a real array too
[00:11:52] <Cork> but i checked a while back and couldn't find a single version where it was :)
[00:11:59] <Cork> so... i dono :)
[00:14:01] <BinaryKitten> Cork if we assume it's not an array, but an array like object.. we'll get in so much less trouble than the assuming the reverse
[00:14:13] * BinaryKitten hi-5s bot-t
[00:14:28] <BinaryKitten> right time to get gone to the office
[00:14:59] <Cork> and just so its said, why its so bad doing for v in arr without doing hasOwnProperty is:
[00:15:36] <Cork> ?eval Array.property.woops = 10; var a = []; for x in a { print(x); }
[00:15:39] <bot-t> Cork: SyntaxError: missing ( after for
[00:15:49] <Cork> ?eval Array.property.woops = 10; var a = []; for(x in a) { print(x); }
[00:15:50] <bot-t> Cork: TypeError: Array.property is undefined
[00:16:00] <Cork> ?eval Array.prototype.woops = 10; var a = []; for(x in a) { print(x); }
[00:16:01] <bot-t> Cork: "woops"
[00:16:10] <Cork> not a god array index to loop...
[00:16:18] <Cork> ?eval Array.prototype.woops = 10; var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for(x in a) { print(x); }
[00:16:18] <bot-t> Cork: "0""1""2""woops"
[00:16:55] <Cork> and yes, some libraries extend the array prototype
[00:16:55] <BinaryKitten> ?eval Array.prototype.woops = 10; var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for(x in a) { if a.hasOwnProperty(x) { print(x); } }
[00:16:57] <bot-t> BinaryKitten: SyntaxError: missing ( before condition
[00:17:07] <BinaryKitten> bah
[00:17:14] <BinaryKitten> ?eval Array.prototype.woops = 10; var a = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for(x in a) { if (a.hasOwnProperty(x)) { print(x); } }
[00:17:15] <bot-t> BinaryKitten: "0""1""2"
[00:18:19] <Cork> alternatively use for(var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {}
[00:18:33] <Cork> (prob the better option)
[00:20:18] <BinaryKitten> for(var i = 0, l = a.length; i < l; i++) {} is even better
[00:20:44] <trips> Hey, I was asked to do a logo for a local jquery usergroup and I have some questions regarding the brand guidelines. Is there anyone in particular I could talk to?
[00:21:30] <BinaryKitten> trips http://brand.jquery.org/
[00:22:03] <trips> seen that, its what I have questions about. thx though
[00:23:34] <BinaryKitten> trips http://brand.jquery.org/press-contact/#bugs  just past the bug section there is an email address for Adam Sontag
[00:24:27] <trips> that'd work
[00:24:31] <trips> thanks a bunch :)
[00:24:55] <BinaryKitten> ping ajpiano
[00:25:49] * BinaryKitten departs for the office
[00:45:35] <iman> I want to call a function when each element that has ".ElemelClass" class wants to remove
[00:45:44] <iman> are there any way to do that in jquery ?
[00:45:58] <mazzachre> Whats with the concole logging on jsfiddle? It seems to log everything!
[00:47:08] <Cork> iman, you want to bind an event when an element is to be removed?
[00:47:22] <Cork> or what is the question?
[00:47:42] <iman> Cork: yes,
[00:47:42] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/6036551 Most efficient way to load an image with the clicked URL within the lightbox?
[00:47:56] <Cork> iman: then no, there isn't a cross browser way to do that
[00:48:10] <iman> Cork: i find one, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2200494/jquery-trigger-event-when-an-element-is-removed-from-the-dom
[00:48:24] <djQuery> iman, how is the element being removed?
[00:48:31] <djQuery> aren't yo udoing it
[00:48:53] <iman> djQuery: $(".foo").remove();
[00:49:44] <djQuery> iman, then write your own remove that does a callback then calls remove if the callback returns anything besides false
[00:49:45] <Cork> iman: yes, but be warned though that that is costly (and i meant by default)
[00:49:47] <iman> when element wants remove call another function to send an ajax to server
[00:49:58] <Cork> djQuery: that is what the link does
[00:50:12] <Cork> iman: also it doesn't work when you replace things
[00:50:14] <djQuery> Cork, sorry just jumping in
[00:50:24] <Cork> like .html('new html')
[00:50:29] <Cork> or .replace
[00:51:31] <iman> this is my issue, I have a price label, when user clicks in label it converts to input as far as changing price, thus user clicks outer place of input and that's input converts to label again
[00:51:41] <djQuery> ah the joys of using a templating engine makes all this null
[00:52:06] <iman> so i have to send this new price value to server
[00:52:11] <Cork> iman: why not just call a separate function when your done?
[00:52:25] <djQuery> iman, why dont you make it easier and just hide the label and show the input and vice vresa
[00:52:32] <djQuery> or use contenteditable
[00:52:38] <Cork> something like $.fn.specialDomUpdated = function() {};
[00:52:44] <aaairc> does anyone know if its possible to detect the "mute" or "unmute" events for the youtube api?
[00:53:07] <Cork> aaairc: no, as its cross domain
[00:53:22] <Cork> as far as i know you can't know anything of what happens there
[00:53:31] <aaairc> while i'm using the youtube embed api
[00:53:34] <Sandra> Did 1.8.11 jQuery ui, datepicker, have any known issues with non-leap year? Anyone know a site that demos that specfic calender?
[00:53:43] <aaairc> but it doesn't seem like they allow you to listen for that event... which i wanted to make sure
[00:53:47] <Cork> aaairc: doesn't that just create an iframe?
[00:54:00] <djQuery> Sandra, have you looked at the bug db?
[00:54:11] <aaairc> yeah, and there are hooks into the youtube player that is in the iframe... so you can detect if someone clicks the play button for example.
[00:54:29] <Cork> ...
[00:54:34] <Cork> how would that work...
[00:54:34] <aaairc> is it possible to detect when a mouse enters and leaves an iframe?
[00:54:49] <Cork> they would have to push it over the youtube server for that to be possible
[00:55:01] <djQuery> $(
[00:55:02] <Cork> aaairc: if its the same domain; yes
[00:55:08] <Cork> aaairc: not cross domain
[00:55:12] <djQuery> ?.content@aaairc
[00:55:13] <bot-t> aaairc, animate element with children with width and height set to 50% - Opened 14 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8243
[00:55:22] <djQuery> stupid bot
[00:55:24] <Cork> djQuery: doesn't work cross domain
[00:55:42] <Cork> ?.contents
[00:55:42] <bot-t> .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[00:55:44] <aaairc> Cork: so your saying its not possible to listen for the play event with a youtube player within an iframe
[00:55:45] <djQuery> does iframe support mouseover/
[00:55:51] <aaairc> because it is with there iframe embed api
[00:56:07] <Cork> aaairc: if you host the player on your side, so the iframe is loading from YOUR domain; sure
[00:56:22] <Cork> but when the iframe is loading content from another domain, you can't access its content at all
[00:56:25] <Sandra> djQuery: Ive tried google it to find someone who had the same issue, but ive come short.. i would figure that the bug db should show up on that search aswell :/
[00:56:27] <Cork> its blocked by the browser
[00:57:07] <Cork> aaairc: else any site could just embed a hidden iframe and access your facebook data directly
[00:57:47] <aaairc> Cork: yeah. i'm asking if its possible with their embed api to detect a mute event
[00:57:56] <Cork> heck scrollTop or height() isn't even accessable cross domain
[00:58:00] <Cork> or the same reason
[00:58:02] <aaairc> like you can with a play event... but it doesn't seem like it
[00:58:23] <Cork> aaairc: only if the api allose for the data to be pushed from the iframe to the server, and you can pull it from there server
[00:58:32] <Cork> the iframe can't talk with your site at all
[00:58:48] <aaairc> Cork: is it possible to detect when my mouse goes into an iframe and when it exits the iframe back into my page?
[00:59:00] <Cork> like i already said; no
[00:59:02] <fRAiLtY-> http://pastie.org/6036551 Most efficient way to load an image with the clicked URL within the lightbox? Line 11 is the link, line 4 is the lightbox call. I tried jQuery(this) but that just loaded the text link. Do I have to manually wrap it in img tags or is there a better way?
[00:59:16] <Cork> see the iframe as a black box; anything that happens in there is hidden from you
[00:59:37] <Cork> thats the effect of cross domain content loading in iframes
[00:59:40] <aaairc> i'm just saying when it enters the iframe... not what it does in the iframe
[01:00:27] <Cork> aaairc: you can change the size and position of the iframe, you can set its src (but not read it)
[01:00:46] <Cork> you can modify style information of the iframe outer border
[01:00:49] <Cork> but thats it
[01:00:52] <Cork> the rest is blocked
[01:01:27] <Cork> everything else has to go through a server to allow the data to reach the other party
[01:01:55] <Cork> well except for sendMessage
[01:02:03] <Cork> but i'm not sure if they use that
[01:08:08] <djQuery> can you wrap the ifram in a div and then just bind to mouseover of the div?
[01:10:59] <greek> Hi fellas. Busy upgrading jQuery-UI. I used to use .tabs("add", ...) to insert a tab at a specific index. With the new approach, I have to update the <ul> list and then call .tab("refresh"). I know how to append to the list according to the docs, but how do I insert a new <li> at a specific index? Alternatively, it always has to be inserted into the second last position, if that makes it easier. Thanks
[01:11:27] <greek> I've tried $("ul#tab_buttons li:last-child").prepend("<li>...</li>"); but this isn't working as expected
[01:12:33] <greek> a-b-c with d being inserted becomes a-b-d-c but then if I insert again it goes a-b-e-d-c, a-b-f-e-d-c, ... etc. instead of a-b-d-c, a-b-d-e-c, a-b-d-e-f-c, etc.
[01:13:53] <greek> This is easier to interpret: 123x after first insert is correct (1234x), but then after repeated inserts I get: 12354x, 123654x, 1237654x, etc. instead of 1234x, 12345x, 123456x, etc.
[01:26:11] <djQuery> $('li').get(-1).insertBefore($('<li>'));
[01:26:17] <djQuery> ?insertbefore
[01:27:24] <djQuery> greek, http://api.jquery.com/insertBefore/
[01:27:40] <the_dark_knight> Hi, is the chromes webkit inspector and the postman to debug jquery same?
[01:28:28] <greek> djQuery, that is awesome. Thanks
[01:28:32] <greek> So elegant
[01:29:06] <djQuery> greek, .get(-1) will start from the end of the array
[01:29:17] <greek> .get(-1) yeah it's great. Also I see I was confusing .prepend()
[01:29:47] <djQuery> greek, yeah you were putting it inside the last li that way
[01:29:57] <greek> :}
[01:30:02] <greek> Thanks for the tips
[01:30:32] <djQuery> greek,  by the way I didnt know that insertbefore existed before I typed it
[01:30:46] <djQuery> I just thought what would I name a function that did that
[01:30:58] <greek> haha that's a sign of good design
[01:31:34] <djQuery> greek, if you can think of it it has most likely allreay been added if it aint stupid
[01:32:08] <djQuery> greek, by the way add a class to your last li and name it something like .lastli
[01:32:37] <djQuery> greek, then var lastli = $('.lastli');
[01:32:39] <greek> djQuery, what about the built-in li:last-child ?
[01:33:08] <djQuery> greek, if you set it as a variable 1 time and you dont have a lot of them fine
[01:33:18] <greek> ok cool
[01:33:27] <Cork> djQuery: you meant .eq not .get
[01:33:36] <Cork> djQuery: .get will give you the dom element :)
[01:33:42] <djQuery> I dont think that on all browsers that any of the :whatever selectors are fast
[01:33:55] <Cork> O_o
[01:34:05] <djQuery> Cork,  thanks for the reminder\correction
[01:34:13] <Cork> uh, no : selectors are slow
[01:34:17] <Cork> (in jquery)
[01:34:39] <Cork> cause they will be iterated over
[01:34:48] <Cork> (in js, not natively)
[01:35:54] <greek> Ok so ("li").prepend(x) puts x inside the <li>x...previous content</li> whereas ("li").before(x) puts it before the entire tag ie: x<li>...previous content</li>
[01:36:47] <dersand> is it possible to whenever use .someAction("some value", function (){});?
[01:37:33] <djQuery> $('selector').perPend('<a>')   will result in <li><a> whatever was allready there</li>
[01:38:23] <djQuery> $('selector').insertBefore('<li>') hmmm I need to look at docs again
[01:38:51] <greek> <li>content</li>, $("li").prepend("x") => <li>xcontent</li>, $("li").before("x") => x<li>content</li>
[01:39:09] <djQuery> greek, read insertbefore wrong
[01:39:35] <djQuery> $('<li></li>').insertBefore('
[01:39:50] <djQuery> $('<li></li>').insertBefore('.lastli');
[01:40:06] <greek> yeah that's doing it from the other perspective
[01:40:22] <djQuery> the only parameter insertbefore accepts is the selecotr for where to put it
[01:41:05] <greek> This is working: $("ul.my-list li:last-child").before("<li>inserted before last</li>");
[01:41:57] <djQuery> cool hadn't looked at before
[01:42:00] <djQuery> ?before
[01:42:08] <djQuery> stupid bot
[01:42:50] <henn1nk> you know parallax. but how can i make this like this page does: http://themetrust.com/demos/hero/ - which jquery plugin should i have to use?
[01:43:13] <greek> I guess it's a matter of preference... (last item in list).before(new list item) vs (new list item).insertBefore(last item in list)
[01:43:41] <djQuery> i like before better
[01:44:07] <greek> me too
[01:44:09] <greek> :)
[01:44:11] <djQuery> create the item then tell it where to go
[01:55:45] <dersand> slideDown() does not seem to work when the selector is disp: none;. It just acts as show()
[01:55:51] <saleem220> I have a mouse over menu simple popup menu http://jsfiddle.net/FwBNE/28/ . When you put your mouse over it, the menu pops down. Is there way that it will popup directly ontop of the text "menu"
[01:57:07] <dersand> saleem220 i dont believe you can typ "div#menu > ul.menu" as a selecetor
[01:57:26] <saleem220> dersand: what does that mean? that fiddle isn't even mine

[02:28:06] <ducky_> any1 help pls
[02:29:34] <kaichanvong> ducky_: using JS Fiddle would help people look at the problem easier + enable them to fork and aid you better http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:29:54] <ducky_> kaichanvong: i dont know how to put it in jsfiddle.
[02:31:38] <ducky_> kaichanvong: i can't find bootstrap

[02:33:02] <kaichanvong> http://jsfiddle.net/mT76T/17/
[02:33:05] <kaichanvong> have a look at that
[02:33:36] <ducky_> kaichanvong: was that to me?
[02:33:58] <Cork> ducky_: you put it in as parts
[02:34:00] <kaichanvong> yes, if you look - you'll see that bootstrap is being used in that example.
[02:34:08] <ducky_> kaichanvong: ok
[02:34:18] <ducky_> cork: so iam guessing we put the style stuff in the top right box
[02:34:55] <Cork> ducky_: yes
[02:35:11] <Cork> unless its external files, then you can load them as resources

[02:35:49] <ducky_> cork: its not loading the css
[02:35:57] <ducky_> ducky: where do i put my bootstrap css
[02:36:07] <ducky_> cork: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css">
[02:36:14] <Cork> ducky_: no, not html
[02:36:24] <Cork> either 1. put the link in manager resources
[02:36:36] <Cork> or 2. put the inline css in the top right edit field
[02:38:21] <ducky_> cork: oo ok
[02:39:40] <ducky_> cork: well, i tried my best http://jsfiddle.net/mT76T/2100/. the hover effect isn't really working, the text disappears take a look pls
[02:39:51] <ducky_> cork: it works fine in my html file though
[02:41:28] <ducky_> cork: wat do u think
[02:41:54] <Cork> still looking
[02:42:15] <ducky_> ok
[02:42:29] <Cork> what is setting the background ?
[02:42:32] <Cork> is it an image?
[02:43:20] <ducky_> cork: there is no background
[02:43:31] <Cork> ok?
[02:43:32] <ducky_> cork: jsfiddle is buggy but thats not my problem
[02:43:42] <ducky_> cork: or i cant put itin right
[02:43:47] <Cork> uh, what is the question?
[02:43:55] <ducky_> cork: do u see the popup menu how it goes down?
[02:43:56] <Cork> the css isn't setting any hover background
[02:43:59] <Cork> so you don't get any
[02:44:08] <Cork> sure
[02:44:09] <ducky_> cork: its working fine on my html fine
[02:44:16] <ducky_> cork: its not working in jsfiddle
[02:44:20] <ducky_> anyway
[02:44:26] <ducky_> cork: i want the menu to go up, not down
[02:44:30] <Cork> then your html file is loading something additionally
[02:44:47] <ducky_> cork: this is my html file
[02:44:47] <ducky_> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=iQP8SxCj
[02:45:22] <ducky_> cork: and it works fine. anyway, do u know how to get the menu to go up?
[02:46:59] <ducky_> cork: are u there
[02:47:07] <Cork> simplest is to change the top: values to bottom: values
[02:47:11] <DarsVaeda> what can I do so I can use ".ready()" on my own function?
[02:47:37] <Cork> DarsVaeda: you need to add some context to that question cause it doesn't make sence
[02:47:40] <Cork> *sense
[02:47:43] <DarsVaeda> okay
[02:48:04] <Cork> ducky_: the sub menu is absolute positioned, in relation to the parent
[02:48:23] <ducky_> cork: im new at this so  i have no idea what ur on about. i feel dumb now.
[02:48:33] <Cork> so you should add an additional class the set resets the top values and set bottom values instead
[02:48:37] <DarsVaeda> I have my own function, in it I do some jquery like say I open a dialog, when I call my own function I would like to be able to add .ready to it so I can do stuff when that dialog has loaded
[02:48:43] <Cork> ducky_: ask in #css
[02:49:06] <Cork> ah
[02:49:12] <Cork> ?.callback @ DarsVaeda
[02:49:12] <DarsVaeda> get it?
[02:49:15] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".callback" in jQuery Docs.
[02:49:20] <Cork> ?.callbacks @ DarsVaeda
[02:49:22] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".callbacks" in jQuery Docs.
[02:49:26] * Cork bot-t
[02:49:30] * Cork hits bot-t
[02:49:51] <DarsVaeda> it's okay I know what you mean :)
[02:49:53] <Cork> DarsVaeda:
[02:50:00] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[02:51:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: so you do var callbacks = $.Callbacks(); return { ready: callbacks.ready };
[02:51:47] <Cork> opps
[02:51:53] <Cork> DarsVaeda: * so you do var callbacks = $.Callbacks(); return { ready: callbacks.add };
[02:53:28] <Anticom2> hi all
[02:53:32] <Anticom2> oh
[02:54:36] <greek> Can someone please help me understand why I'm getting "jQuery UI Tabs: Mismatching fragment identifier." with the following piece of code (jQuery UI tabs): http://jsfiddle.net/nbW8v/ Thanks
[02:54:39] <Anticom> um i'm trying to send post data to a script loaded in an iframe... for that i wanted to generate post data on the fly
[02:55:13] <Anticom> what's the easiest way to kind of unserialize an Object into hidden form elements?
[02:55:22] <Cork> Anticom: you don't
[02:55:30] <Anticom> greek "TypeError: sel.getElement(...) is null"
[02:55:32] <Cork> you would have to actively create the dom elements
[02:56:08] <Anticom> Cork that's exactly what i wanted to do... append a form-element to the dom, insert a whole bunch of hidden elems, submit the form and get rid of it all again
[02:56:58] <Cork> $('#target').html('<input attr="value"><input attr="value"><input attr="value"><input attr="value">').submit().empty();
[02:57:17] <greek> Anticom, any idea what's causing that?
[02:57:30] <Anticom> well you're simply appending dom elements to "insert" tabs
[02:57:39] <Anticom> jq-ui should offer some sort of api to do that
[02:58:07] <Anticom> greek http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#manipulation look at the source for this example to find out how to add tabs the right way ;)
[02:58:14] <Cork> isn't that alert in jsfiddle?
[02:58:17] <greek> Anticom, according to the api that's how I'm supposed to do that
[02:58:37] <Anticom> i'm not that much into jq ui :)
[02:58:50] <Cork> Anticom: http://fiddle.jshell.net/nbW8v/show/
[02:58:54] <Cork> no error
[02:58:58] <Cork> so that is unrelated
[02:59:12] <Anticom> hmm
[02:59:18] <sacrilicious> hi, i am using $(this).hide();
[02:59:22] <greek> Anticom, here is the doc that said I must do it that way: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-add-and-remove-methods-and-events-use-refresh-method
[02:59:23] <Anticom> but still #2 is not having any content
[02:59:38] <Cork> greek: and i get no error here at all, it works just fine
[02:59:45] <greek> Anticom, I'm not too fussed about content, I just want the matching panel to be created :/
[02:59:49] <sacrilicious> however, i want to hide the class(pattern) just after $(this).....
[02:59:52] <greek> Cork when you change between tabs?
[03:00:07] <Cork> ah
[03:00:16] <Anticom> sacrilicious $(this).next('.pattern').hide();
[03:00:36] <Anticom> think next will work
[03:01:03] <DarsVaeda> somehow I did not get it: http://jsfiddle.net/FbCV2/
[03:01:04] <Anticom> greek using deprecated stuff never makes me happy^^
[03:01:23] <Cork> greek: prob cause you don't have the target element for those tabs
[03:01:29] <greek> Anticom, heya I don't mean to sound nasty but read that link a bit closer. I'm moving away from deprecated code to the new way
[03:01:41] <Anticom> althought the api seems to have got worse than before
[03:01:46] <Anticom> god almighty
[03:01:47] <greek> Anticom, agreed
[03:02:09] <Anticom> i've seen that it's a migration guide
[03:02:30] <greek> Cork, help me understand please? Not sure what you mean
[03:02:53] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/FbCV2/1/
[03:03:15] <Cork> greek: when you click a tab jquery looks for that section to show it
[03:03:23] <Cork> and the alert comes from it not finding it
[03:03:40] <greek> Cork, I thought "refresh" rebuilds the tab based on the updated <ul> nav-panel?
[03:03:47] <Cork> the tab yes
[03:03:55] <Cork> but not the content related to it
[03:04:20] <greek> So how would one add new tabs dynamically? Must I manually create the tab panel as well?
[03:04:30] <Cork> greek: there should be a div below the ul with the div id="tabs-xx"
[03:05:00] <Cork> that is what jquery-ui is complaining about
[03:05:07] <greek> With the previous version (1.8) it would add the new tab panels dynamically, so long as the first one was created (tab1), which I've done
[03:05:15] <Cork> it can't find the id to show the element
[03:05:34] <greek> I guess I hastily assumed "refresh" would follow a similar route
[03:06:07] <greek> So basically with the new API I must create the nav panel and tab panel manually and then call refresh
[03:07:07] <greek> Cork, but what confuses me is that the API upgrade guide makes no mention of creating the tab panel manually. It says to only create the nav panel list item: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-add-and-remove-methods-and-events-use-refresh-method
[03:09:49] <laddet> I have a jquery that i really love (bootstrap menu dropup http://jsfiddle.net/andresilich/NMs4Z/2/) but in the drop up menu, there is no sub menu like this 1 http://jsfiddle.net/devinwalker/8BWqE/. can someone please implement a sub menu into the first jsfiddle link?
[03:13:19] <DarsVaeda> so close works but open doesn't? is it because it is opened to fast? http://jsfiddle.net/FbCV2/2/
[03:15:58] <duderion> hi
[03:16:17] <duderion> what's the best way to access a single li in a ul without selecting its parents
[03:16:31] <duderion> i'd like to show a menu beside the li on hover
[03:16:48] <laddet> duderionL menu like this http://jsfiddle.net/andresilich/NMs4Z/2/
[03:16:58] <soee> hi, how can i count all not checked checkboxes in group ?
[03:17:32] <duderion> laddet: i have a simple ul tree
[03:17:46] <duderion> and i'd like to 'add' 'insert' 'delete' nodes
[03:17:58] <laddet> duderion: im not good with web deveIopment xD
[03:18:03] <duderion> :)
[03:18:08] <duderion> ill create a fiddle...
[03:18:15] <duderion> perhaps someone can help me...
[03:18:27] <laddet> duderion: i could of helped you if i knew how soz
[03:19:21] <Cork> soee: select the group, select all checkboxes in it and filter out the one that is checked
[03:19:28] <Cork> then count the size of the list
[03:19:54] <Cork> soee: $('.group input[type="checkbox"]').not(':checked').length
[03:20:18] <Anticom> hmm funny... i'm getting an error when using jq.min.js but when i load jq.js to be able to trace the error i don't get it any more :O
[03:20:40] <Cork> duderion: depends on if you do this from an event or not
[03:21:18] <Cork> Anticom: sounds like your code might not close things correctly so that the parser fails with the minimized version
[03:21:21] <Cork> or the other way around
[03:21:47] <Anticom> but why should i not get the error with the non-minified version then?!
[03:21:53] <soee> Cork, thank you
[03:21:58] <henn1nk> sorry a beginner question: how can i combine .fadeIn and .animate?
[03:22:03] <Anticom> js should still complain about not properly closed stuff
[03:22:05] <Anticom> ;)
[03:22:28] <Anticom> henn1nk http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4198091/chaining-jquery-animations-that-affect-different-elements
[03:22:28] <Cork> Anticom: it MIGHT be that the minimized version ends up with a different flow then the normal one
[03:22:42] <Cork> thats one of the problematic effects that sometimes happen from minimizing
[03:22:54] <Anticom> it's minified using the closure compiler isn't it Cork ?
[03:23:16] <Anticom> i always knew that google products suck... :D
[03:23:25] <Cork> i think its using another script; but i'm not sure
[03:23:53] <Cork> you can find the minimizer script on the github repo
[03:23:56] <Anticom> whatever... alhtough it's throwing an error the script execution still continues
[03:24:13] <Anticom> in ff at least... i'm afraid of testing it in IE :D
[03:24:20] * Anticom pokes IE
[03:24:22] <Cork> whats the error?
[03:24:50] <henn1nk> Anticom: no. i would like to use fadeIn and animate on one object
[03:25:12] <henn1nk> $('.welcome_choose').hide().delay(500).fadeIn(2000)
[03:25:16] <Anticom> dafuq... used minified now again but didn't get the error :/
[03:25:20] <henn1nk> at the moment
[03:25:43] <Anticom> henn1nk um... select the element (it's got to be hidden) and call fadeIn method
[03:25:57] <Cork> henn1nk: .animate({ opacity: 1, /* other values */ })
[03:26:07] <Cork> thats how you combind fadeIn with animate
[03:26:07] <henn1nk> Anticom: i only need to know how to fade in and moving the element at the same time :)
[03:26:08] <Anticom> is fadeIn deprecated?
[03:26:13] <Cork> no
[03:26:24] <Anticom> then you can simply chain the methods
[03:26:32] <Anticom> they'll get executed simultaniously
[03:26:34] <Cork> Anticom: not if you want them to run at the same time
[03:26:36] <Cork> no
[03:26:41] <Anticom> :O
[03:26:51] <Anticom> almost simultaniously*
[03:26:53] <Cork> they'll get run in succession
[03:26:53] <Anticom> :P
[03:27:00] <Anticom> do they?!
[03:27:02] <Cork> yes
[03:27:06] <Anticom> hmm
[03:27:07] <Anticom> ok
[03:27:10] <henn1nk> $('.welcome_choose').hide().delay(500).animate({opacity:1})
[03:27:10] <Cork> ?jQuery.queue
[03:27:11] <bot-t> jQuery.queue(element, [queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.queue/
[03:27:13] <Anticom> Cork is the grand master
[03:27:14] <henn1nk> doesnt display anymore :(
[03:27:30] <Cork> ah
[03:27:38] <Anticom> ^_^
[03:27:42] <henn1nk> $('.welcome_choose').hide().delay(500).animate({opacity:1, top: '-100px'})
[03:27:46] <henn1nk> would be nice.
[03:27:59] <Cork> henn1nk: $('.welcome_choose').hide().delay(500).show().css('opacity', 0).animate({opacity:1})
[03:28:09] <Cork> hmm no that won't work
[03:28:17] <Cork> the show will drop through the queue
[03:28:33] <henn1nk> Cork: so how to do this? :)
[03:28:39] <Cork> henn1nk: try $('.welcome_choose').hide().delay(500).animate({ display: 'block', opacity:1})
[03:28:44] <Cork> not sure if that works
[03:29:11] <Cork> henn1nk: if you could make a fiddle that would help
[03:29:16] <henn1nk> Cork: doesnt work :(
[03:29:21] <henn1nk> Cork: okay
[03:29:27] <rickibalboa> Quick question, say I have $('a.some-link').live('click', ....) and there are 40 a.some-link's, are there 40 events?
[03:29:53] <Cork> henn1nk: then i could test ageist what your trying to do without asking you to test
[03:30:05] <Cork> rickibalboa: don't use .live
[03:30:07] <DarsVaeda> maybe I should do it this way? http://jsfiddle.net/FbCV2/3/
[03:30:10] <Cork> ever; EVER
[03:30:12] <henn1nk> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/YH2By/
[03:30:26] <Cork> rickibalboa: use .delegate or .on
[03:30:31] <rickibalboa> Hmm okay
[03:30:39] <Cork> (if .on it should be with the delegate syntax)
[03:32:13] <rickibalboa> My major concern is if I have for example a list with a large number of elements, with a link inside and I want to bind a click to that link, how do I do it without duplicate events
[03:32:21] <rickibalboa> Can .on() or .delegate() do that
[03:33:28] <the_dark_knight> Why isn't this - $(function(){ alert('hi'); }); work in chrome but it works in firefox?
[03:33:46] <Cork> henn1nk: http://jsfiddle.net/YH2By/1/
[03:33:57] <jomofcw> Hello !
[03:34:06] <Cork> rickibalboa: those are the two that can
[03:34:20] <rickibalboa> Ok thanks Cork
[03:34:27] <Cork> rickibalboa: bind will bind one on each element, live will throw away time selecting every element
[03:34:52] <rickibalboa> Ahh makes sense now
[03:34:53] <Cork> delegate can do exactly what live was meant to, but with a sane structure
[03:34:59] <henn1nk> Cork: now i need to move the element
[03:35:02] <duderion> if you had a ul,li structure, and you would like to show a 'context menu' on li:hover
[03:35:04] <henn1nk> Cork: during the fadeIn
[03:35:21] <Cork> henn1nk: so set it to position: relative, or position: absolute
[03:35:30] <Cork> and move it with top or left like you want
[03:35:35] <duderion> how would you build that...
[03:35:37] <Cork> or do it with margin if you prefer that
[03:35:42] <henn1nk> Cork: ah thanks
[03:35:44] <henn1nk> works
[03:36:08] <Cork> duderion: on hover find the li through $(this)
[03:36:12] <Cork> then work with it
[03:36:30] <duderion> yes, but that selects the parents too
[03:36:31] <jomofcw> I'm trying to submit a form on a radio field change. Doing this "$form.find('.myRadios').on('change',function(e){console.log($(this).val()+ ' - ' +($(this).is(":checked")?'oui':'non'));$form.trigger('submit');});" it display me the rights value in the console, but submit the form with the previous one :/. Any idea about how to fix it please ?
[03:36:58] <Cork> duderion: something like $('some-parent').on('hover', 'li.has-context', function() { $(this) });
[03:37:06] <duderion> kk
[03:37:32] <Cork> duderion: ah you mean parent parent li
[03:37:35] <duderion> yes
[03:37:35] * Cork nods
[03:37:46] <duderion> cause the li is child of li and so on
[03:37:46] <Mohsen_Hassani> greetings...I need a widget to accept only Persian or Arabic letters. Non-English words actually. I googled but no result... Is there any script?
[03:37:56] <Cork> anyway ya, you would have to have something to base the exclusion of
[03:38:23] <duderion> hm
[03:38:28] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: shouldn't be too hard to fiddle that together
[03:38:52] <Cork> Mohsen_Hassani: but no there most likely isn't any premade scripts for that
[03:39:16] <duderion> as i can't predict the depth of the tree, i cannot use pure css
[03:39:23] <the_dark_knight> Why doesn't this - $(function(){ alert('hi'); }); work in chrome but it works in firefox?
[03:39:41] <duderion> the_dark_knight: doesn't make sense
[03:39:49] <duderion> take a look at the console
[03:39:50] <Cork> the_dark_knight: where are you running that line?
[03:40:10] <Cork> the_dark_knight: might be you add it too late so you miss the event or something
[03:45:50] <jomofcw> I'm trying to submit a form on a radio field change. Doing this "$form.find('.myRadios').on('change',function(e){console.log($(this).val()+ ' - ' +($(this).is(":checked")?'oui':'non'));$form.trigger('submit');});" it display me the rights value in the console, but submit the form with the previous one :/. Any idea about how to fix it please ?
[03:47:41] <Cork> jomofcw: var self = $(this) setTimeout(function() {$form.trigger('submit'); }, 0);
[03:47:46] <Cork> opps
[03:47:50] <Cork> jomofcw: setTimeout(function() {$form.trigger('submit'); }, 0);
[03:48:02] <Cork> misst that you already had a variable for the form :)
[03:53:29] <MacroMan> I want to act on a parent when the child is selected. eg: I want to hide the tr element, but based on the class of a td: $('tr td.tohide').hide();
[03:53:42] <jomofcw> Cork i try it !
[03:53:46] <MacroMan> That doesn't seem to work. Any ideas?
[03:53:50] <duderion> that's my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/duderion/CYp2R/2/
[03:54:11] <MacroMan> Here is my test: http://jsfiddle.net/yKJ6v/
[03:54:33] <Cork> MacroMan: $('td.tojhide').closest('tr').hide()
[03:55:02] <Cork> you can't select backwards in css
[03:55:14] <Cork> so you have to select the target then find the parent with .closest
[03:55:25] <jomofcw> Cork : it give me the same result bro :(...
[03:55:58] <MacroMan> Cork, Thank you, but closest doesn't seem to work either: http://jsfiddle.net/yKJ6v/2/
[03:56:17] <Cork> jomofcw: wait, radio, do you have multiple of those then?
[03:56:50] <Cork> ah
[03:57:04] <Cork> it needs to be more complex if you want multiple of them
[03:57:15] <jomofcw> Cork the only inputs I have in this form are input[type=radio][name=myRadios]
[03:57:29] <jomofcw> Cork wait, I think I have a problem somewhere else...
[03:57:35] <Cork> MacroMan: $('td.tohide').each(function() { $(this).closest('tr').hide(); });
[03:57:52] <Cork> jomofcw: you can't really have checked on a radio
[03:58:08] <Cork> it switches state with other radios of the same name
[03:58:13] <Cork> so you must always have at least two
[03:58:16] <MacroMan> Cork, ah, I have to loop the elements. Thank you.
[03:58:35] <Cork> MacroMan: ya, as your class is on the wrong level
[03:58:44] <Cork> MacroMan: the correct fix is to move the class to the tr
[03:58:57] <Cork> as you can select the td with the tr parent with the class
[03:59:02] <Cork> but you can't do it the other way around
[03:59:23] <Cork> the class should always be on the outer most element that it makes sense on
[03:59:31] <MacroMan> OK. Unfortunately, the class needs to be on the child, but looping will work fine, thank you.
[03:59:39] <Cork> else you will have these problems, with messy code, and slow selectors
[03:59:53] <Cork> MacroMan: why does it need to be on the td?
[04:01:12] <MacroMan> Cork, I've got a table of data and some input boxes at the top. When I type in the input box I want to show the rows where the column matches the input box. Each field (td) needs the value to filter on, not the row
[04:01:45] <MacroMan> Since I will be able to filter with multiple columns at the same time.
[04:01:53] <Cork> MacroMan: well that is what it has now, i don't see that as a reason why it has to be that way
[04:02:03] <Cork> so?
[04:02:10] <Cork> just add the different classes to the tr element
[04:02:24] <Cork> that would speed up your code A LOT
[04:02:49] <MacroMan> Hmm. didn't really think about classes having multiple values. Of course.
[04:03:10] <MacroMan> That could cause me some problems though
[04:04:13] <MacroMan> Say I had 2 columns and 2 rows. a1 has value 'something' and b2 has value 'something'. If I were to use the class on the tr, then searching 'something' in column a would return both rows.
[04:04:58] <Cork> well you could just prefix it
[04:05:03] <MacroMan> I need to be able to distinguish what column has what value and not just that row has that value in it somewhere.
[04:05:04] <Cork> with what data it contains
[04:05:09] <Cork> like .name-something
[04:05:15] <Cork> .date-something
[04:05:16] <Cork> and so on
[04:05:59] <MacroMan> Makes sense. COuld I still use that with jQuery( "[attribute*='value']" ) somehow?
[04:06:11] <Cork> todo what?
[04:06:15] <MacroMan> Which is, select based on substring
[04:06:29] <Cork> not for the classes no
[04:06:33] <MacroMan> Since the string will now contain .name-someting etc
[04:06:53] <Cork> just add the values before you do the selection
[04:07:22] <MacroMan> But what about partial search matches? Using the class I think I can only select whole words?
[04:07:34] <Cork> $('table').find('.' + $('#filter-type').val() + '-' + $('#search').val())
[04:07:41] <Cork> ah
[04:08:03] <Cork> there i would prob hold the data in an array instead
[04:08:11] <Cork> and search in that for matching rows
[04:08:29] <Cork> but ya, if you need that it might be better to search without classes
[04:09:03] <MacroMan> Hmm. I'll try with looping through the classes and if I end up with messy code, I'll prob go with an object.
[04:09:04] <Cork> it would prob be best to do a custom filter instead
[04:10:31] <MacroMan> Here is table I'm working with, with sample data: http://jsfiddle.net/g5KYf/
[04:11:07] <Cork> MacroMan: something like $('table tr').hide().filter(function() { return regex.test($(this).text()) }).show();
[04:11:30] <Cork> regex is a variable where you convert your search to regex
[04:12:01] <Cork> ?eval var regex = new Regex('search value', 'g');
[04:12:17] <Cork> sigh and the bot is dead again
[04:12:25] <MacroMan> Hmm, not seen the filter method before. Interesting
[04:12:41] <Cork> opps
[04:12:50] <Cork> i did it wrong wrong
[04:12:57] <Cork> it was meant to search based on td not tr
[04:13:03] <Cork> but you get the idea
[04:13:19] <MacroMan> Yeah, thanks, I'll try and see if I can get that working
[04:14:10] <MacroMan> Hmm. Need to hide the tr, but search on the td.
[04:14:49] <Cork> ya, so you need to search the td based on a class or something (to search only on the td your interested in
[04:15:13] <MacroMan> Ok. Just needed to read the docs on filter. Think I've got it now, thanks for all your help.
[04:15:27] <Cork> $('table tr').filter(function() { return regex.test($(this).find('td.type').text()); })
[04:16:54] <jhb> newbie question: I have all pages in one document. For loading all pages (e.g. doc.html#subpage)  but the entry page I need to check if a condition is met, and if not, load the entry page instead. What event do I need to catch, and how can I abort further event handling on the subpage, and instead move to the entry page?
[04:17:07] <jhb> oh, thats jquery mobile, of course
[04:29:24] <nVee> hey guys, not sure if anyone is on stackoverflow but if you want to have a go at this I would really appreciate it :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14686733/simple-jquery-function-not-picking-up-click-function
[04:39:21] <MacroMan> Is there an onchange style event that fires when an input box is typed into, not just after it loses focus (so it would be fired on every keystroke).
[04:39:22] <MacroMan> ?
[04:40:47] <blackspotwiggins> MacroMan, onkeydown
[04:41:43] <MacroMan> blackspotwiggins, Of course. Thank you.
[04:49:12] <Parsi> i'm using Disqus instead of wordpress default commenting system. it loads comments from external source, how can i change loaded div, spans class?  getElementsByTagName("external_div_tag") returns null
[04:49:39] <Parsi> "external_div_tag" exists when i view generated source code
[04:50:55] <Ziggy`> You're not even using jQuery it seems and your asking about this here?
[04:51:44] <ravenzz> Parsi why would you do that?
[04:51:47] <Parsi> Ziggy`: jquery is loaded in top of page, but when I use $("#foo") if says $ is nnot a function
[04:52:03] <Ziggy`> Parsi: That's because you're using an iframe I'm guessing.
[04:52:14] <Parsi> yes, it's using iframe
[04:52:26] <ravenzz> so you can't luckly :P
[04:52:46] <ravenzz> it could break if you change its classnames and ids
[04:52:49] <ravenzz> I think
[04:52:49] <Parsi> is it possible to access to iframe elements ravenzz?
[04:53:35] <ravenzz> not if the iframed content is hosted on another domain
[04:53:53] <ravenzz> and you don't have control over it/the target server
[04:54:00] <Ziggy`> I beg to differ?
[04:54:23] <ravenzz> go ahead
[04:54:25] <Parsi> i want to append some classes to some of divs
[04:55:22] <MacroMan> That function that cork showed me earlier: $('.projects tr').hide().filter(function() { return "/"+search+"/i".match($(this).find('td.'+column).text()); }).show(); How can I pass the variables in to the anonymous function. I can't seem to work it out?!
[04:55:57] <MacroMan> I need to pass the variables search & column.
[04:58:06] <ravenzz> Parsi read the disqus' faq  http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/526768-introducing-disqus-2012-and-f-a-q-
[04:59:20] <Parsi> ravenzz:
[05:00:10] <ravenzz> MacroMan do you also have a testcase?
[05:00:19] <ravenzz> "/"+search+"/i".match($(this) <- this looks wrong to me
[05:00:25] <MacroMan> ravenzz, Yeah, hang on.
[05:03:12] <chilversc_> is there a safe way to fetch an element by an id that comes from the page?
[05:03:16] <Ziggy`> ravenzz: Makes sense about not being able to modify an external page iframe, it's not subject to the same origin policy.
[05:03:35] <Ziggy`> Didn't think of that.
[05:03:36] <chilversc_> ie, similar to the way you'd use parameterised queries in sql
[05:03:44] <MacroMan> http://jsfiddle.net/gnZG4/
[05:04:38] <MacroMan> The anon function inside filter() needs to have the column and search variables.
[05:04:40] <chilversc_> esentually, all I really want is document.getElementById, only I want the result as a jQuery object, and I want jQuery's error handling/compatibilty fixes
[05:04:43] <Ziggy`> ravenzz: THere's an easy workaround though, but I find it kind of a hack to do it that way.
[05:06:16] <Ziggy`> ravenzz: I guess you could curl the page with php and then it's on the same domain.. But I'm on the same page as you, why the need to modify the external's source page..
[05:06:32] <chilversc_> hmm, I really think that this section should be moved in to its own function: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L130
[05:06:55] <chilversc_> so that you can do something like; $.id("foo") to get an element by id
[05:07:44] <MacroMan> chilversc_, That looks horrible. What's wrong with $("foo").attr('id); ?
[05:08:13] <chilversc_> MacroMan: naw, its more to avoid; $("#prefix" + someVariable)
[05:08:43] <chilversc_> MacroMan: ie, I know that I want to match an id, so if someVariable goes awry, I don't want it accidentally becoming a CSS selector
[05:09:06] <Ziggy`> chilversc: I don't follow..
[05:09:44] <ravenzz> MacroMan http://jsfiddle.net/gnZG4/1/
[05:09:50] <chilversc_> Ziggy`: standard thing such as; var item = ...; var element = $("#items-" + item);
[05:10:44] <duderion> i never thought that a tree navigation could be that hard ;/
[05:10:45] <ravenzz> Ziggy` their own js relies on some classname I believe, so it is better to don't mess with them
[05:10:57] <chilversc_> I just figured since I know that must be an id, if something goes wrong with that value I don't want it being interpreted as a CSS selector, I just want to get back an empty selector
[05:11:28] <MacroMan> ravenzz, That works really well, but how is the anon function seeing the non-global variables?
[05:11:41] <chilversc_> I considered using $(document.getElementById("foo")) but that then loses jQuery's compatability shims
[05:11:56] <MacroMan> ravenzz, Is it because you declared $test as global?
[05:12:31] <chilversc_> so I figured, why not just separate out those lines of code to their own function that can be used when you know you're working with an id?
[05:12:35] <ravenzz> MacroMan the problem was with the regular expression
[05:12:48] <ravenzz> the other are just side improvements
[05:13:24] <MacroMan> Hmm, strange. When I use the chrome inspector on my current code, search and column definately aren't available inside the anon function.
[05:13:29] <ravenzz> you save the selection into variables so you don't have to do it every time the user press a key
[05:13:51] <ravenzz> MacroMan that's impossible
[05:14:12] <MacroMan> ravenzz, That's not actually going to work in my instance. This table is loaded in via AJAX, so I can't bind them to global variables like that.
[05:14:45] <MacroMan> But, I can adapt that to work. THank you
[05:14:57] <ravenzz> they shouldn't be global!
[05:15:33] <MacroMan> ravenzz, I mean the $test, $projects & $always variables.
[05:15:55] <ravenzz> still you shouldn't have global variables at all
[05:16:33] <MacroMan> I have a couple, but that's only because the type of app I'm developing
[05:19:53] <ravenzz> MacroMan this is what you can do I think http://jsfiddle.net/gnZG4/2/
[05:20:43] <MacroMan> ravenzz, Looks neat. THanks
[05:34:48] <xinming_> how do we query the dom which is not in page? For example, I got a fragment via ajax, How do I query data within that fragment using jquery?
[05:35:10] <aldug> In my html, I have a bunch of <span class="outer">Outer Data<span class="inner">Inner Data</span></span>.  I have created a $(".outer").click function that is called when one of the outer spans is clicked.  Within that function, I want to get the value of what is inside that inner span.  What is the easiest way to do that?
[05:35:17] <toxz> is it possible to call the callback of an event without firing the event itself?
[05:48:17] <a11r> Check out the backlink builder http://ge.tt/api/1/files/1vjoTQX/0/blob?download
[06:00:39] <mazzachre> I have this http://jsfiddle.net/mazzachre/C64Pm/ Can anyone help me with getting the ellipsis to work? (Scroll the inner block to the right and see what I mean)
[06:36:56] <aero1> is event.which broken on IE?
[06:56:20] <smaira> jquery post doesnt wrk on IE9 ?
[06:59:02] <Kasimir> smaira: should work just fine, tho I have come across with a problem in URL address (double quotes) on post method
[07:00:08] <smaira> this doesnt fire anything in IE9 but works in Chrome
[07:00:08] <smaira> http://pastebin.com/066bMV5y
[07:00:22] <smaira> even the request doesnts get fired when I check through fiddler
[07:01:44] <Kasimir> smaira: Does IE9 developer give any errors then?
[07:03:13] <smaira> no Kasimir
[07:03:26] <smaira> just doesnt do anything
[07:04:03] <Freshcoat> Hello!, I am building my own star rating (module for framework) and I am just fighting with the part to hover (all) the start from left to right if someone just point the cursor on star 4
[07:04:22] <Freshcoat> With what kind of function I neef to create this?
[07:04:50] <Freshcoat> Couldn't find the answer in the jquery documentation
[07:05:08] <WebDragon> NICE. did the new site come out with the release of 1.9.x ?
[07:08:01] <Kasimir> Smaira: it doesnt seem to fire at all on jsfiddle
[07:08:24] <smaira> yup, really strange
[07:09:19] <Kasimir> You sure about the php side?
[07:10:42] <smaira> what about it ?
[07:10:53] <MrTool> @smaira: did you try using .always instead of .success for debuging ?
[07:11:09] <smaira> not really MrTool
[07:11:14] <smaira> you mean for XHR?
[07:11:39] <MrTool> generaly, cause in chrome on jsfiddle it work for me but cancled
[07:14:52] <MrTool> http://pastebin.com/thdgRimX
[07:15:09] <MrTool> try this one, it work for me but i get an cross domain request problem wich is normal
[07:16:51] <smaira> ok
[07:18:22] <DarsVaeda> I get a "trigger called incorrectly" with this line "$('#close.dialogClose').click(function() { dialog.dialog('close'); });" in jqueryLint
[07:18:28] <DarsVaeda> why?
[07:21:57] <smaira> MrTool, I allowed cross domain requests in the php script. The chrome console error vanished but it never shows an alert or prints anything on the console. On IE, it doesnt even send out the request
[07:22:38] <MrTool> @smaira: can you give me an url where you currently use the script
[07:22:50] <smaira> hmm ?
[07:22:52] <smaira> its run locally
[07:22:56] <MrTool> oh
[07:23:01] <MrTool> hmm
[07:23:07] <MrTool> a second pls
[07:24:12] <smaira> http://getagig.in/script.php
[07:24:47] <MrTool> loooool
[07:24:49] <MrTool> i found it
[07:24:50] <MrTool> xD
[07:24:51] <MrTool> omg
[07:25:28] <MrTool> http://pastebin.com/a5m7AMYk
[07:25:29] <MrTool> here
[07:25:31] <MrTool> xD
[07:25:39] <MrTool> .always is an chain method to ajax
[07:25:53] <MrTool> and not an property of the ajax options
[07:25:55] <MrTool> ^^
[07:26:38] <smaira> ok trying
[07:27:18] <smaira> ok i have a success in chrome
[07:27:19] <smaira> trying ie
[07:27:48] <smaira> success here too!
[07:28:20] <Kasimir> is your json correct smaira
[07:28:43] <smaira> yeah
[07:29:00] <Kasimir> getting a parseerror
[07:29:07] <Kasimir> http://jsfiddle.net/HJX2v/1/
[07:31:38] <gordian> hey guys, i'm using a jQuery slider and i'd like to add some navigation bullets below the main slider area
[07:31:40] <gordian> https://raw.github.com/springload/FadeSlide.js/master/jquery.fadeslide.js
[07:31:47] <gordian> that's the slider i'm using
[07:32:00] <smaira> Kasimir,
[07:32:09] <smaira> My php scripts just echoes a message
[07:32:13] <gordian> i added the bullets in my html but i'm not quite clear on how i can make them functional
[07:32:28] <smaira> I tried a very simple json too, seems like Im still getting the parse error
[07:32:51] <Kasimir> Atleast the fiddle example works tho smaira haha
[07:32:56] <gordian> i know i need to bind the bullet click to the slide event but i'm unsure how i can make it slide to the exact slide i want
[07:33:05] <alaing> Hi guys, I've got a div which I'm inserting content to  and this div then gets scrollbar. Any idea how I most the user so to position them at the bottom of the div without the user having to manually scroll
[07:33:09] <smaira> hahaha
[07:33:10] <smaira> yeah!
[07:33:16] <smaira> I think I know whats wrong
[07:33:39] <MrTool> Does anyone know how i can access __proto__ in IE!?
[07:35:01] <Ziggy`> MrTool: You know what __proto__ is?
[07:35:58] <MrTool> a little bit, its an magic function afaik and IE doesn't support it
[07:35:59] <MrTool> xD
[07:36:36] <Ziggy`> It seems to me you have no clue what it is.
[07:36:58] <alaing> so any idea how I can drop the user at the bottom of a div that has a scroll bar
[07:37:22] <MrTool> ehm no.... '-.-
[07:37:42] <dcherman> MrTool: __proto__ is a non-standard property anyway, you probably shouldn't use it.  what are you trying to do
[07:38:33] <MrTool> i wana create something like an module extender
[07:38:51] <Ziggy`> And why do you need to refer to __proto__ ?
[07:39:12] <gordian> basically i know how to bind the navigation click to the slide event, but i'm not sure how to make it go to a specific slide
[07:39:21] <gordian> if anyone could take a look i'd really appreciate it
[07:39:26] <MrTool> maybe you understand it better if i paste the code on pastebin.
[07:39:34] <Ziggy`> MrTool: Do that.
[07:41:03] <MrTool> http://pastebin.com/Bggi1Xcy
[07:41:22] <MrTool> some variables are overhead
[07:41:38] <MrTool> its wip code
[07:43:32] <dcherman> MrTool: why are you putting constructor functions on the jQuery prototype?  stuff like this makes no sense: $game = new $.fn.gameHelperCore();
[07:44:20] <MrTool> im working with jquery in this way since one month
[07:44:39] <MrTool> before i only use normal function etc.
[07:45:28] <Ziggy`> I'm not gonna start preaching here, but you're doing it wrong.
[07:46:20] <aero1> Does e.which || e.button work reliably in IE7/8/9 ?
[07:46:22] <MrTool> Ok, do you have any tutorials or something else to make it better!?
[07:46:47] <aero1> During events
[07:47:11] <MrTool> i used an bolierplate i found on google for this
[07:50:50] <alaing> any idea why .scrollTop() wouldn't move a div
[07:51:50] <BillCriswell> alaing: That's how much the element should scroll from the top, not how far down you'd have to scroll to reach that element.
[07:52:15] <Ziggy`> MrTool: It's good that you're trying, keep at it. You need to seperate this from jQuery However, it seems to me you're not quite understanding how jQuery plugins should work.
[07:52:29] <alaing> I'm trying to scrolldown the div but its not working.
[07:52:55] <MrTool> i dont think that my function would be an jquery plugin at all
[07:53:05] <alaing> $('#foo').scrollTop($('#foo').height());
[07:53:12] <Jayflux> How can I use .when with Jsonp? It doesn't seem to work or trigger
[07:54:39] <Ziggy`> MrTool: That's the thing.. jQuery should be a dependency for this thing you're making, this thing should not be built on jQuery.fn.
[07:54:54] <Ziggy`> That's my $.2
[07:54:57] <BillCriswell> alaing: Not sure why that wouldn't work. Any errors besides that?
[07:55:21] <alaing> let me try a jsfiddle
[07:55:51] <BillCriswell> alaing: http://jsbin.com/erovoy/1/edit is what I came up with.
[07:55:55] <BillCriswell> It does work.
[07:57:20] <alaing> BillCriswell: does overflow have to be scroll?
[07:57:28] <alaing> mine is set to suto
[07:57:32] <alaing> auto
[07:57:38] <BillCriswell> auto should work as well.
[07:57:40] <MrTool> @Ziggy: but i can use something like  $.gameHelperCore()
[07:58:01] <BillCriswell> alaing: What is $('#foo').height() reporting?
[07:58:07] <alaing> 1112
[07:58:18] <alaing> and increases as more content i added
[07:58:45] <BillCriswell> alaing: Do you have a height set on the div?
[07:59:01] <BillCriswell> It sounds like you just have a box you want to scroll without a height set on it.
[07:59:35] <MrTool> But how can i get the method inheritance!?
[07:59:45] <alaing> I have a container div that has the overflow and height/width set
[07:59:54] <alaing> could that be it?
[08:00:05] <BillCriswell> You'd want to scrollTop on that then.
[08:01:17] <alaing> So $('#wrapper').scrollTop($('#foo').height()) ?
[08:01:26] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:01:42] <Ziggy`> MrTool: It seems to me you need to go from scratch.
[08:01:50] <alaing> Actually that makes perfect sense :-)
[08:01:57] <alaing> why didn't I think of that lol
[08:02:11] <Ziggy`> MrTool: Write down what you need to achieve and go at it, copying someone else's code and only modifying it is never a good idea, you need to get inspired/learn from it.
[08:02:15] <BillCriswell> alaing: It's all that damn internet's fault.
[08:02:31] <alaing> pmsl - exactly!!!
[08:06:21] <amcsi_work> what's a good expression to call it when for instance, instead of returning a json response from the server with just the data result from the ajax call, but to add an extra layer containing a success property, a count property and an error message properly, and the data property that now contains the data?
[08:06:40] <amcsi_work> what is the act of transforming just the data into an encapsulated data called?
[08:09:33] <MrTool> @Ziggy: I know what you want to tell me but for myself i learn something better in copying existing code, bring it to work and then refactor it.
[08:15:26] <dylix> this is prolly so easy for you guys but im stuck. im trying to parse this json file http://pastebin.com/Gch4WwRd with this htmml code http://pastebin.com/yetHCnSK .. but getting nowhere
[08:19:59] <Freshcoat> How can I set the 'i' starter of the .each function to '1' instead of the default value '0' ?
[08:20:12] <jamesdotnet> amcsi_work: perhaps "wrapping"
[08:20:26] <NoiseEee> Freshcoat: add 1?
[08:20:31] <Freshcoat> or can I use an count var with count++ something like that
[08:21:06] <Freshcoat> NoiseEee, I need the counter 1,2,3.. etc not starting from 0
[08:21:15] <NoiseEee> Freshcoat: add 1 before you use it.
[08:22:06] <Freshcoat> such as var i = 0; ?
[08:23:12] <NoiseEee> Freshcoat: i'm not sure how to explain it any plainer
[08:23:50] <NoiseEee> arrays and collections start at 0, its the way it is.  if you need the first counter to be '1' for whatever reason, add 1 to the counter when you iterate.
[08:24:25] <Tsd_> hi @all

[08:25:18] <Freshcoat> goit it work

[08:32:35] <Jayflux> anyone know why $.when doesn't work when you use jsonp?
[08:33:12] <Tsd_> do you work synchronus or async
[08:33:19] <Tsd_> i guess that should be the problem
[08:33:26] <Tsd_> maybe
[08:33:31] <Tsd_> just a idea
[08:34:07] <dcherman> Jayflux: what doesn't work?  a jsfiddle demonstrating your problem would be helpful
[08:34:29] <Jayflux> does jsfiddle still work?
[08:35:05] <dcherman> ......yes.
[08:37:54] <Jayflux> ok dcherman, I've picked this api as an example. Notice how i don't get 'Done' in the console.log
[08:37:56] <Jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/FV5Jc/
[08:40:46] <gordian> nevermind, figured it out myself
[08:40:51] <gordian> best way i guess
[08:42:00] <Jayflux> dcherman: any ideas?
[08:44:02] <dcherman> Jayflux: yes - look at the response from your jsonp request - it's using a custom callback name which is probably in their documentation somewhere.  pass jsonpCallback: "pollingCallback" to your ajax request and it'll work.
[08:44:19] <Jayflux> ok dcherman let me try that
[08:45:07] <Jayflux> dcherman:  you're a star, thank you
[08:45:20] <Pnoexz> hey, im having a bit of an issue with .bind. I have a list of elements which have to be binded to a click event, the thing is the list will grow in numbers as the user navigates the page. The problem is that every time i try to bind the new ones, the old ones get rebinded and the function is run multiple times for a single element
[08:45:22] <Jayflux> I don't get why that works though
[08:45:26] <Jayflux> dcherman ^
[08:45:33] <Pnoexz> (do know im changing bind() to on() once i get this solved)
[08:45:34] <blez> someone using YQL?
[08:47:49] <dcherman> Jayflux: without that param, jQuery passes a custom function name like "jQuery18308163516416680068_1359996291138" as the callback name - their response isn't set up to call a function named like that, it's set up to call one named "pollingCallback".  they're doing it wrong imo, but that's how they've got it set.
[08:48:40] <Jayflux> dcherman:  if you don't mind explaining, how are they doing it wrong? Is it because the callback should be defined from the user?
[08:48:41] <fRAiLtY-> What's the best way to say in a .each statement on a select, for every option that DOESN'T contain a string, remove it?
[08:49:58] <dcherman> Jayflux: pretty much.  i dont see a reason to enforce a specific callback name, and it just complicates things if you have multiple concurrent requests going on to the same endpoint that may not have the same callbacks
[08:54:57] <MrTool> @Ziggy: I changed the files and it would be glad if you can tell me if i am on the right way :) http://pastebin.com/UUnZvAF8
[09:21:10] <amcsi_work> is it a good idea to do jqEls.push(htmlEl)?
[09:21:31] <ravenzz> what jqEls is?
[09:22:10] <amcsi_work> or for every jq function for manipulating jq objects, is there an important internal procedure running that would be skipped if I just pushed html els natively on a jq object?
[09:22:14] <amcsi_work> jqEls is a jq object
[09:22:22] <ravenzz> selection?
[09:22:49] <amcsi_work> okay, my goal is to create a bunch of <option> tags for a select
[09:23:09] <miCSu> ain't push some prototype array method?
[09:23:26] <amcsi_work> but I feel uncomfortable with using optionElsSoFar = optionElsSoFar.add(optionEl), because it seems slow
[09:23:44] <amcsi_work> I'm thinking of just doing optionElsSoFar.push(optionEl[0])
[09:23:56] <amcsi_work> it is an array method
[09:24:04] <amcsi_work> that's why I mean natively
[09:24:42] <ravenzz> can't you just append?
[09:25:06] <miCSu> how about some solution like $("<option>").val("someVal").text("someText").appendTo($(selectEl)) ?
[09:25:11] <amcsi_work> I can, I'm just worried of the possible overhead
[09:25:39] <amcsi_work> is that even better?
[09:26:02] <miCSu> dunno
[09:42:42] <keirlav87> i am serializing an object which uses numerical keys, however they do not start at 0, so when i check the object it says 'undefined' 225 times and then shows my keys, can anyone suggest a good way to change the keys to strings which i can parseInt on the server instead?
[09:42:59] <NoiseEee> don't use an array
[09:43:24] <Sweeetie> o/
[09:43:49] <keirlav87> they are database id's which are sent to the server - for example option[152] (value)
[09:44:28] <keirlav87> so $('input[name="option[152]"]')
[09:44:47] <systemfault> He said it, don't use an array… use an object instead and the id as key
[09:46:11] <keirlav87> i am
[09:47:04] <systemfault> Would you mind showing us how you're doing it?
[09:48:17] <keirlav87> i'm using a custom plugin from SO called serializeObject the source of which is here - https://github.com/macek/jquery-serialize-object
[09:48:54] <systemfault> And how do you iterate on that object?
[09:49:07] <thisboy> I'm trying to randomize the order of my images at http://jsfiddle.net/CfsEb/2/ -- can someone point out what I'm doing wrong though?
[09:49:42] <keirlav87> i don't iterate on the object, i just serialize the form inputs into an object using that plugin
[09:51:07] <keirlav87> however when log the resultant object i see undefined however many times before my first numerical key
[09:51:17] <systemfault> Perhaps it's that plugin that is bogus
[09:52:35] <alicefreak> I want to update some attribute in hidden div. Suppose I've data-rating attribute in hidden div. I want to update data-rating value.
[09:52:35] <alicefreak> I am using following statement. ('#hidden_div_1`).data('rating', '25');
[09:52:42] <alicefreak> Ok I've working js fiddle example(http://jsfiddle.net/KZBW6/6/ ). I am using same code in local machine. But It is not working I mean value is changing. Can some one please please help me? I've wasted one day. :(
[09:53:05] <alicefreak> value is not changing*
[09:53:25] <MalMen> in jquery how do i check if a div is show or hiden ?
[09:54:18] <brantje> MalMen: if ($("#id't).length <= 0)
[09:54:26] <brantje> ow wait
[09:54:47] <brantje> if($('.selecor').attr('style')=='hidden')
[09:54:59] <systemfault> MalMen: You should know since you created it, no?
[09:55:00] <brantje> like that
[09:55:20] <brantje> whoops
[09:55:33] <brantje> replace attr with css
[09:55:44] <brantje> and style with visible
[09:56:11] <systemfault> MalMen: Beside that, it's a matter of state, in css you could create a "hidden" class… and you could add/remove the 'hidden' class to show/hide/test if shown/hidden
[09:56:57] <systemfault> Using .css is usually (but not always) a sign of bad design and creates fragile and difficult to maintain code
[09:59:57] <keirlav87> yes sorry, the plugin was pushing numerical keys to an array rather than named keys in an object
[10:00:40] <systemfault> keirlav87: It's not your fault...
[10:19:02] <csdco_> I read that specifying the element type in addition to the class is faster, and this makes obvious sense (ex: $('div.someClass') vs $('.someClass') ). Is this also true with IDs or is there not really any performance benefit?
[10:19:26] <csdco_> For example, $('div#myId')
[10:19:46] <BillCriswell> cdiehl: I'd imagine .foo would actually be quicker than div.foo since it can use document.getElementByClassName
[10:20:31] <BillCriswell> csdco_: I think it would strip the "div" part out of div#myId out since there's only one #myid (if your HTML is legit).
[10:20:57] <csdco_> BillCriswell: Wouldn't getElementByClassName search through many more elements to find matching classes?
[10:20:58] <BillCriswell> document.getElementById() is as fast as you're getting it probably.
[10:21:07] <csdco_> BillCriswell: Good point!
[10:21:46] <csdco_> BillCriswell: Well now I'm confused. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/905883/is-binding-events-in-jquery-very-expensive-or-very-inexpensive/905962#905962
[10:22:06] <csdco_> The selected answer here says that div.myclass is faster than .myclass.
[10:22:35] <systemfault> And more flexible
[10:22:40] <systemfault> What?
[10:22:56] <systemfault> Nevermind, I read the opposite
[10:23:03] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Haha.
[10:23:43] <BillCriswell> csdco_: I'd need to run a few tests. Wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong. It just seems to make more sense to be able to use getElementsByClassName
[10:24:11] <csdco_> BillCriswell: Yeah now that you use the actual javascript function names, I'm obliged to agree with you.
[10:24:16] <systemfault> The only thing I can say on DOM Node selection…. They're all slow, so avoid doing it, cache everything in variables :D
[10:24:31] <systemfault> s/selection/selection functions
[10:24:40] <jrockjiggz> v
[10:24:41] <jrockjiggz> http://jsperf.com/jquery-selector-benchmark
[10:25:21] <csdco_> systemfault: Cache everything in variables?
[10:25:22] <systemfault> A benchmark for that is pointless.. unless you're doing like the benchmark in your prod code (selecting elements a million of times for no reason)
[10:25:52] <systemfault> csdco_: var myNode = $(mySelector); then reuse myNode instead of reselecting
[10:26:15] <zoned> $(".container").find(".cards").find( <divs that DO NOT have the class "hidden"> )   // what would this selector look like?
[10:26:35] <cannjeff> Which event handler attachment function is the base?
[10:26:35] <systemfault> .card div:not(.hidden) perhaps
[10:26:36] <BillCriswell> zoned: div:not(.hidden)
[10:26:44] <systemfault> *.cards
[10:27:00] <systemfault> cannjeff: You mean?
[10:27:09] <csdco_> systemfault: So on dynamically added content, e.g. a link that should have a function bound to it's click event, how would this be added to the variable? And wouldn't I end up using arrays, looking for and removing elements, etc? That seems like more code than it's worth.
[10:27:19] <cannjeff> as in, $.on(), $.bind(), $.live() all are really wrappers for what
[10:27:35] <cannjeff> isn't there something they all end up calling, IE $.on()
[10:27:36] <systemfault> cannjeff: Nowadays, you always use .on, nothing else
[10:28:20] <systemfault> csdco_: Depends on the case, really.. and event delegation can go a long way for event handlers.
[10:28:35] <systemfault> That way, you don't need to rebind all the time.
[10:28:43] <cannjeff> In our older code we have a mix of the above (live, bind,..)
[10:29:01] <csdco_> systemfault: Thanks for the info.
[10:29:06] <BillCriswell> csdco_: http://jsperf.com/div-test-vs-test
[10:29:09] <cannjeff> i was under the impression that they all really end up calling $.on() or one of the others
[10:29:24] <systemfault> cannjeff: .on has two forms, one for normal event handling (like .bind) and another for event delegation(like .live and .delegate)
[10:29:31] <csdco_> BillCriswell: Wow, awesome!
[10:30:06] <mg9831> Howdy
[10:30:13] <systemfault> cannjeff: So forget .bind/.click/.live/.delegate...
[10:31:04] <cannjeff> Im not using them, i also don't feel like working through our entire codebase and replacing all .bind, .live handlers
[10:31:13] <mg9831> how can I capture a mouse scroll event… but have it fire just once at a time, not a series of mouse downs… so that a site like this http://whitmansnyc.com/ would just go to the next 'page' on a scroll swipe?
[10:32:25] <zoned> how about a selector that says… "has class X, but doesn't have class hidden"
[10:32:41] <systemfault> .X:not(.hidden)
[10:32:53] <BillCriswell> systemfault you type too damn fast!
[10:33:11] <BillCriswell> I had just typed the ".".
[10:33:34] <systemfault> cannjeff: It's okay, I'd be surprised if the old functions were removed, it would break too many plugins
[10:33:43] <systemfault> BillCriswell: :P
[10:34:51] <cannjeff> i agree, but I'm trying to write a wrapper on one of the functions, which is the "base" to solve an issue with TouchEvents
[10:46:31] <Whirl3d> could someone please explain why my anchor elements in this tab panel aren't firing events? http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/kcRjY/6/
[10:47:07] <Whirl3d> nvm I'll just do it like everyone else does it. Even if it is crappy and hacky.
[10:48:13] <thisboy> Trying to do like http://iam.beyonce.com (http://metafizzy.co/blog/beyonce-seamless-fluid-image-masonry/) but using Isotope instead of Masonry. Any idea why this won't work by default, but only after one resizes ones window? http://jsfiddle.net/RJZu6/
[11:13:39] <wscott_> Is there an easy way to find the label that has innerHTML of a certain string?
[11:14:01] <rmill> "the label" ?
[11:14:02] <wscott_> is it as easy as $('label[html=*mystring*]')?
[11:14:10] <systemfault> Nope
[11:14:14] <wscott_> damn
[11:14:26] <systemfault> If you need to do that… you're doing it wrong.
[11:14:35] <wscott_> so I'm stuck with $('label:contains(*mystring*)').get(0)
[11:14:36] <systemfault> Ah.. I'm on #jquery
[11:14:38] <systemfault> Sorry
[11:14:39] <wscott_> well crap
[11:14:53] <systemfault> I was going to suggest contain :/
[11:15:11] <wscott_> yeah.. that won't work either
[11:15:20] <rmill> wscott_: Why can't you just use a id/class?
[11:15:28] <rmill> Like a normal person... ;D
[11:15:28] <wscott_> can't know for sure the order they'll fall into on the page
[11:15:32] <systemfault> wscott_: You can't do it another way, it's hackish if you need to rely on the text.
[11:15:49] <wscott_> yeah n/m .. I just had an idea
[11:15:56] <wscott_> let me play with this a bit
[11:19:01] <yogurt_truck> that's what she said
[11:19:07] <arinel> is this a good channel for questions about jQuery Mobile?
[11:20:55] <devoldmx> Hi, is anyone using jquery 1.9 in production?
[11:21:49] <systemfault> I do, why?
[11:24:32] <devoldmx> have you notice a difference in performance? Specifically with JSON
[11:24:36] <sunbeam> i have got this function jQuery.post(ajaxurl, data, function(response) { }
[11:24:38] <sunbeam> $page = get_page($page_id); <- this is what i have in the ajax file
[11:24:41] <sunbeam> how can I return and use $page for my frontend?
[11:25:22] <civilordergone> hey, has anyone here worked w/ jquery visualize [graphing library]
[11:25:32] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: $output['result'] = json_encode($page);        result is in response.result
[11:25:41] <systemfault> devoldmx: I did not :/
[11:26:29] <yogurt_truck> sunbeam: it depends on what $page has? ask over at ##php or the channel for whatever framework you're using
[11:26:32] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: shouldn't i return $output ?
[11:26:43] <sunbeam> yogurt_truck: page has an array of objects
[11:27:06] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: yeah echo it, send a JSON header beforehand
[11:27:45] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: actually $output['result'] = $page;  header(json stuff); echo json_encode($output);
[11:27:55] <ajpiano> devoldmx: what about "JSON" do you reckon got slower in 1.9 ?
[11:28:13] <devoldmx> ok, thank you systemfault I was looking if there was a real advantage
[11:28:54] <yogurt_truck> NoiseEee: why the $output array?
[11:29:07] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok, why the json header btw
[11:29:18] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: because you're returning a JSON response
[11:29:28] <devoldmx> @ajpiano Not, The performance was almost the same in our test. I just want to be sure
[11:29:39] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok
[11:29:48] <NoiseEee> yogurt_truck: to help classify things when you're sending back more than one bit of info.  $output['userDetails'] = $userObject;  $output['killingScheme'] = $murderPlan;
[11:30:00] <ajpiano> devoldmx: ok
[11:30:03] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: header('Content-type: application/json');
[11:30:05] <sunbeam> this one right?
[11:30:32] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: yes
[11:30:46] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: personally i always send expired headers as well, mostly out of habit
[11:31:38] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok thanks!
[11:31:48] <yogurt_truck> NoiseEee: right but you don't know if such structure is already returned by that "get_page" function. whatever
[11:31:50] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: but when i try to alert(response) nothing happens
[11:31:53] <sunbeam> i just see it in console
[11:32:34] <NoiseEee> yogurt_truck: yeah i was just providing a general how-to-do-ot
[11:32:39] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: what can i tell you
[11:33:02] <keirlav87> anyone experienced trouble with jquery ui resizable, where the resizable element won't resize past a certain point within it's container?
[11:34:54] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: how can i use the response var
[11:35:23] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: console.log it, see what it is and how to use it
[11:35:41] <sunbeam> its an json object, but i don't get how I can use this and add json contents to div's
[11:35:57] <Parsi> I have a <ul> with multiple <a> inside it
[11:36:35] <Parsi> how handle click event for all <a>s with single script?
[11:36:41] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: maybe you can pastebin sample code and someone can help you
[11:37:21] <NoiseEee> Parsi: if you wanted to confine it to that <ul>,  $(ulIdentifier).on('click','a',function() { //console.log('only fires on click events on a tags in my ul!'); })
[11:37:31] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: ok
[11:38:54] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: nvm sorry made typo
[11:39:26] <Parsi> NoiseEee: how can i findout which <a> is clicked? who is responsible?
[11:39:50] <BillCriswell> Parsi: The event's target.
[11:40:07] <sunbeam> NoiseEee: how can i extract this json array?
[11:40:16] <NoiseEee> Parsi: the function should be   function(ev) { var clickedElement = $('ev.target'); }
[11:40:19] <BillCriswell> function(e){ var $clickedLink = $(e.target); });
[11:40:29] <Parsi> thank you
[11:41:58] <NoiseEee> sunbeam: data.key = value
[11:44:54] <sunbeam> ok
[11:45:27] <xrdodrx> I can't find this in the documentation...how do I destroy an event set with on()?
[11:45:41] <Parsi> NoiseEee: in my case, alert(e.text()) does not work. says Error: TypeError: e.text is not a function
[11:45:45] <Parsi> it should work
[11:45:49] <NoiseEee> xrdodrx: $(el).off()
[11:45:52] <Parsi> nah?
[11:45:58] <xrdodrx> NoiseEee: thanks :)
[11:46:01] <xrdodrx> (duh!)
[11:46:04] <NoiseEee> Parsi: e.text() is not a function
[11:46:20] <NoiseEee> Parsi: what are you trying to get?  the text between <a></a> ?
[11:46:24] <Parsi> yes
[11:46:34] <NoiseEee> use jquery methods.  .text() or .html()
[11:46:35] <Parsi> the text between <a></a>
[11:46:46] <Parsi> i'm doing that
[11:46:53] <Parsi> alert(e.text())
[11:47:02] <NoiseEee> you'll need to turn the target into a jquery object
[11:47:20] <NoiseEee> function(ev) { var el = $(ev.target);  console.log(el.text()); }
[11:47:23] <Parsi> $(e).text() doesn't work
[11:47:30] <Parsi> aow
[11:47:31] <Parsi> ok
[11:57:22] <Whirl3d> So I need to populate 4 small sections of my site with ajax content from a wordPress installation. Would it be wise to just grab all four pieces in one ajax call or can I call each one separately without degrading performance too bad?
[11:58:45] <Sendoushi> it really depends
[11:58:49] <Sendoushi> talking about query?
[11:59:50] <systemfault> In practice, calling them separately is going to be a little bit slow but not that much because requests are done in parallel.
[11:59:56] <systemfault> s/slow/slower
[12:01:08] <Sendoushi> that's why i asked if it is a query
[12:01:15] <Sendoushi> a query returns a long nested array
[12:01:43] <Sendoushi> so every time you query you get an extensive nested array so... one query would be better than 4
[12:01:51] <Sendoushi> even all working parallel
[12:03:29] <katsh> I cant seem to find a ajaxSend for local requests in the api docs. does it not exist?
[12:03:56] <katsh> basically what i'd like to do is show a loading img on a div before the request gets send
[12:04:31] <katsh> but don't think i should set that up in the ajaxSend since its global
[12:04:43] <Cork> katsh: you mean an ajaxSend that depends on a dom element or something?
[12:05:24] <Cork> well, ya, just start the animation before you call ajax/what ever you use
[12:05:31] <Cork> and then stop it on .always()
[12:05:39] <Cork> that should solve it
[12:06:46] <katsh> uhmm
[12:06:58] <katsh> I mean one option is to show the loading div on click
[12:07:33] <katsh> but i figured there would be a better way. i remember there was a 'before' function for local ajax requests
[12:07:43] <katsh> that would fire before that certain request was made
[12:08:20] <djQuery> hey Whirl3d
[12:08:34] <puchacz> hi, what's the current recomendation for IDE please? I am accustomed to Eclipse and Emacs
[12:09:02] <systemfault> puchacz: For JS, jetbrain IDEs are the best.
[12:09:07] <djQuery> Whirl3d, do sometimes you only need 1 of them and other times you need all of them?
[12:09:26] <systemfault> puchacz: Emacs is quite good at JS
[12:09:52] <puchacz> systemfault: which one? I haven't used intellij for about 10 years. and does it "understand" jquery?
[12:10:09] <systemfault> puchacz: Depends on what server-side language you use
[12:10:24] <puchacz> systemfault: Common Lisp
[12:10:37] <puchacz> systemfault: I use Slime in Emacs if you know it
[12:10:39] <systemfault> puchacz: Wow, I'd so love to use that as server-side language at work
[12:11:03] <puchacz> systemfault: not at work. guess where I use Eclipse/Java though :)
[12:11:23] <systemfault> Well, since I don't think jetbrains has any Common Lisp IDEs… then take a look at webstorm
[12:11:30] <systemfault> Try it, see if you like
[12:12:05] <puchacz> systemfault: payware only? (I don't mind in the long run, just asking)
[12:12:10] <systemfault> I found that the jetbrains IDEs are the only one with JS autocompletion that works..
[12:12:19] <systemfault> puchacz: Unfortunately, yes.
[12:13:01] <systemfault> I bought my IntelliJ personal license because I think it's that good (IntelliJ has plugins for a lot of languages, I recently used it for Clojure :P )
[12:14:16] <puchacz> systemfault: $49, I will swallow this. thanks! I take it "understands" jquery out of the box, doesn't it?
[12:14:29] <puchacz> ($49 after 30 days)
[12:14:46] <systemfault> puchacz: I haven't tried webstorm… so I don't know.
[12:14:55] <systemfault> I just know it's the same JS support I have in IntelliJ
[12:15:22] <puchacz> systemfault: I see, so it is intellij without java then
[12:15:38] <systemfault> Right, exactly that.
[12:16:57] <rideh> so say I have http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/api/products/510826bd172679eda6dd1e42 can I use $.getScript() to load {calc_func: ""} ?
[12:17:44] <djQuery> been using aptana myself
[12:18:24] <systemfault> Aptana's JS autocompletion was complete suckage the last time I tried it.
[12:18:32] <systemfault> Beside that, it's not bad.
[12:19:35] <et09> i have a .on("click",function(){...}) which replaces the class with one that has a .on click of its own
[12:19:45] <puchacz> I found it a while ago, somehow I did not like it....
[12:19:47] <et09> how do i make sure it accepts that .on thing when the class gets changed?  i thought it did that
[12:19:51] <puchacz> aptana I mean
[12:19:55] <thisboy> Anybody know why this fluid Masonry setup only works _after_ one resizes ones window? http://jsfiddle.net/RJZu6/
[12:20:45] <djQuery> et09, depends on which .on you are using
[12:21:15] <et09> what do you mean?
[12:21:20] <djQuery> $('container').on('click', '.someclass', function(){ ..... })
[12:21:45] <djQuery> versus $('.someclass').on('click', function(){});
[12:21:50] <et09> it's the second
[12:21:59] <rideh> Anyone know how I can load js from this json output http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/api/products/510826bd172679eda6dd1e42
[12:22:35] <djQuery> et09, think the 2nd is the equivalant of just doing $('.someclass').click(function{})
[12:22:43] <djQuery> brb
[12:22:49] <et09> i think i tried that first
[12:22:50] <djQuery> will need to look it up in a min
[12:22:58] <systemfault> rideh: That's awful… but I guess you have to load it with $.get/$.ajax as json… then eval() calc_func
[12:23:13] <rideh> systemfault: another idea?
[12:23:44] <systemfault> rideh: I don't know.. I personally don't send JS code via JSON
[12:23:52] <systemfault> Just data… strings..
[12:24:01] <rideh> systemfault: right, well its actually in the db, but i have access via this api
[12:24:21] <rideh> but i need to select from any number of products with a widget
[12:24:47] <systemfault> I don't think you can do it another way.
[12:24:48] <rideh> and i've yet to figure out how to put both the formula and the form as json and rehydrate on other end…  so right now its kinda.. raw
[12:26:35] <et09> is there still support for .live() ?
[12:27:57] <NoiseEee> et09: you shouldn't be writing new code with it, no
[12:28:34] <sunbeam> $('.list li a').click(function() { // do something }
[12:28:41] <rideh> systemfault: http://m.runyonsurfaceprep.com/calculators is where i'd like it to render it's form widget.  is there a completely different approach i can take other than having 60 some odd forms hide/shown on select with correspnding functions?
[12:28:44] <sunbeam> how can i make this function something that's usable else wheer?
[12:29:44] <systemfault> rideh: All those calculators have nothing in common?
[12:30:10] <rideh> systemfault: pretty much, there are 8 differnt formats / calculations
[12:31:12] <rideh> but each product has its on mix ratios and specifics. perhaps i could make a library for the 8 types of calculation and their respective forms
[12:31:33] <rideh> pass the specific variables to it as it's used, but that kinda puts me right back to where i am now
[12:32:29] <systemfault> rideh: I get the problem now :/
[12:33:42] <systemfault> Is the javascript different for all templates?
[12:34:41] <rideh> surface area, surface-linear-foot, joint-volume, pour-volume, pour-volume-sqft, etc
[12:35:03] <rideh> systemfault: i could make the function a lot more complex to handle all cases looking for a hidden form value to determine which to use i suppose
[12:36:07] <rideh> systemfault: and add the co-efficents as hidden values as well so it knows what to use, but the form is going to change a lot for each one. even joint volume, 1 product is for gaps under 2" and others for over 2" etc
[12:36:40] <systemfault> Perhaps you could do everything client-side
[12:37:03] <systemfault> 8 templates with a small templating engine to substitute values… then your algorithms.
[12:37:30] <systemfault> But I understand that what you need to do isn't simple.
[12:37:58] <rideh> yeah seems to be making it overly complex, i'd like to give it a good solution like that later, so it renders form and the js based off of product
[12:38:05] <rideh> but for right now I just need it there
[12:38:40] <djQuery> et09, you need to read the doc again. A selector string to filter the descendants of the selected elements that trigger the event. If the selector is null or omitted, the event is always triggered when it reaches the selected element.
[12:38:49] <systemfault> rideh: Then if your json+js works.. just finish it
[12:38:56] <systemfault> rideh: You'll need eval though
[12:38:57] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:39:33] <rideh> systemfault: thanks will give it a go
[12:39:39] <systemfault> :)
[12:39:59] <djQuery> et09, if you want .on to catch stuff at a latter time you ned to use
[12:40:39] <djQuery> $('container').on('click', 'selectorofitemtobeclicked', functin(){ do this when clicked});
[12:45:04] <brantje> why does the $('<div/>').dialog() focus the first link in it?
[12:45:13] <brantje> Is there an way to prevent it?
[12:46:05] <djQuery> brantje, .dialog always focuses the 1st focusable item in it
[12:46:21] <brantje> indeed
[12:46:31] <brantje> is there an way to prevent it
[12:46:38] <djQuery> brantje, if you want something else focusable just make it first
[12:46:55] <brantje> I don't want anything to be focussed
[12:47:07] <djQuery> if you want nothing you could try putting a dumy element in it then hide it after the dialog is open
[12:48:12] <djQuery> brantje, but there is not option for what to focus and I doubt there will be
[12:50:17] <brantje> fixed it :)
[12:50:23] <brantje> <djQuery> if you want nothing you could try putting a dumy element in it then hide it after the dialog is open
[12:50:26] <brantje> ty
[12:50:52] <brantje> lucky me i have a global function to create dialogs :D
[12:51:11] <djQuery> brantje, show me your code because that might have issues if you hide the dialog then show it again
[12:51:38] <djQuery> brantje, I think the whole find the focus element is done in the open event
[12:51:44] <sunbeam> how can i fetch what # is used in the url?
[12:51:49] <sunbeam> like domain.com/list/#SOMETHING
[12:51:54] <sunbeam> i need the value after #
[12:51:57] <djQuery> ?bbq

[12:52:45] <sunbeam> djQuery: ok, but isn't there a default jquery way?
[12:53:04] <djQuery> sunbeam, no
[12:53:10] <djQuery> not that I am aware of
[12:53:19] <systemfault> sunbeam: location.search IIRC
[12:53:26] <BillCriswell> I hate when I try something out of curiosity and before I know it it's damn close to 5 lol
[12:53:39] <djQuery> BillCriswell, lol
[12:53:55] <brantje> whehe
[12:54:10] <systemfault> Err
[12:54:14] <systemfault> location.hash
[12:54:27] <systemfault> sunbeam: Sorry
[12:54:39] <Brodingo> window.location.hash.slice(1)

[12:55:03] <sunbeam> ok
[12:55:06] <sunbeam> thanks
[12:55:32] <BillCriswell> Think you want substr(1)?
[12:55:36] <djQuery> brantje, why are you replacing the title after the dialog has been created? why not just set the title of the div before calling .dialog on it
[12:56:53] <BillCriswell> Duh. Nevermind.
[12:56:56] <BillCriswell> They both work.
[12:57:25] <brantje> djQuery well
[12:57:37] <brantje> becauce in that case i can use html in the title
[12:57:41] <brantje> because*
[12:57:46] <djQuery> brantje, if you hide the dialog then show it again your gonna have the same issue
[12:58:01] <brantje> Nope
[12:58:07] <brantje> Already tryed it
[12:58:32] <djQuery> brantje, coool I was wrong, but I did notice that it doesnt have a callback for hide
[12:58:58] <brantje> close: function(event, ui){
[12:58:58] <brantje> 											$(this).dialog('destroy').remove()
[12:58:58] <brantje> 									},
[12:59:22] <djQuery> brantje, hiding it and closing it are 2 differnt things
[12:59:35] <brantje> True
[13:00:22] <brantje> I have the feeling that i use dialogs for purposes they aren't created for :')
[13:00:25] <djQuery> brantje, just to cover all the basses have you tried hiding it and showing it again and seeing if the focus happens again
[13:00:45] <brantje> yea ,tried it, and no focus :)
[13:01:09] <djQuery> cool
[13:03:59] <djQuery> brantje, if you are using it for other stuff you might like this http://jsbin.com/ukixuc/9/edit
[13:04:20] <diphtherial> hey, what's the most reliable way to capture every key press (including repeated keys from holding a key down) into a textarea? i'm trying to use the 'keypress' event, but apparently it doesn't catch backspaces
[13:04:20] <djQuery> brantje, notice the extra buttons where the X usualy is
[13:05:45] <diphtherial> if there's a library that gives you the entire word at the cursor up to the previous non-letter delimiter, that'd be ideal
[13:05:56] <brantje> nice :)
[13:06:00] <diphtherial> (e.g. "hello there bob" with the cursor at the end would just give "bob")
[13:06:18] <djQuery> brantje, it still needs some work but you get the gist
[13:06:35] <brantje> yes i do
[13:06:38] <brantje> have the same
[13:06:46] <brantje> but then
[13:06:49] <djQuery> do you now
[13:06:58] <brantje> they can be minimized
[13:07:04] <brantje> to a boytom bar
[13:07:06] <djQuery> mind showing me yours? like to see how your was implimented
[13:07:09] <brantje> bottom*
[13:07:15] <djQuery> brantje, dun that before
[13:07:25] <brantje> http://v3.friendstream.net/1index.html#
[13:07:31] <brantje> old test page
[13:08:18] <djQuery> looks good like it without the rounded corners on that page
[13:08:30] <brantje> yea :)
[13:09:23] <djQuery>  when I did it I threw them into a container at the bottom of the page that looked like a windows task bar
[13:09:58] <brantje> Hehe :P
[13:10:36] <brantje> Can send you a screen how i looks now
[13:11:44] <brantje> djQuery: http://awesomescreenshot.com/064vyki83
[13:12:23] <Tomashe> hey guys i got a regular post with jquery
[13:12:39] <Tomashe> and i got in return "NetworkError: 500 Internal Server Error - "/includes/forms.php"
[13:12:39] <systemfault> Congratulations :D
[13:12:52] <brantje> W00t
[13:12:56] <systemfault> Tomashe: Then you have a server-side problem with PHP
[13:12:58] <brantje> Look who messed the server
[13:13:03] <brantje> up
[13:13:05] <brantje> xD
[13:13:06] <Tomashe> like what?
[13:13:10] <systemfault> Tomashe: Errors in the 5XX are server-side
[13:13:11] <brantje> missing a ;
[13:13:19] <systemfault> Tomashe: Could be anything, really.
[13:13:25] <brantje> or forgot to close an }
[13:13:26] <Tomashe> hmmm
[13:13:30] <Tomashe> anyone can have a look?
[13:13:36] <ricree> Is there a way to add a bunch of handlers to a deferred? Like the old .then used to do? Or will I have to loop over the array and add them manually?
[13:13:44] <brantje> Tomashe, php reports the error
[13:13:51] <brantje> look in your debugger
[13:13:54] <brantje> and go debug
[13:13:57] <Tomashe> i did i see nothing wrong
[13:14:00] <djQuery> brantje, looks like you went a more brute force method, where as the time I did it I want more of a plugin method
[13:14:09] <Tomashe> as long as i output any text in that it gives me that erro
[13:14:10] <brantje> hehe :P
[13:14:16] <Tomashe> if i dont output anything ist not
[13:15:01] <Tomashe> anyone mind to have a look?
[13:15:26] <NoiseEee> Tomashe: its a backend / server error
[13:15:36] <Tomashe> it cannt be
[13:15:37] <ricree> Tomashe: since it's server side, perhaps try #php instead
[13:15:39] <Tomashe> i can show u
[13:15:46] <Tomashe> its not server side! it cannt be
[13:15:55] <Tomashe> cuz the output is OUT
[13:16:09] <ricree> maybe your client code has the wrong post url, then
[13:16:19] <djQuery> brantje, by the way there is a title option in the newest dialog that lets you specify the html for the title http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-title
[13:16:59] <Tomashe> this scipt is weird but let me check agin
[13:17:20] <ricree> Is there a way to add a bunch of handlers to a deferred? Like the old .then used to do? Or will I have to loop over the array and add them manually?
[13:18:27] <initself> i'm trying to find if any of the option value in my select box are set to Y
[13:18:37] <initself> i initially thought grep was the right way to do this
[13:18:52] <initself> but i'm not sure now
[13:18:57] <initself> if ($.grep(('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"]').options, function(n,i) {
[13:19:02] <initself> i believe that is wrong so far.
[13:20:03] <djQuery> $('select').find('option').filter(function(){ if(this.value = 'x'){}});
[13:20:16] <NoiseEee> $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"]').find('option[value="y"]');
[13:20:21] <initself> filter!
[13:20:42] * initself tries both.
[13:20:52] <NoiseEee> but mine would require the option value to be set inline, versus <option>y</option>
[13:21:13] <djQuery> $('select').find('option[value="y"]');
[13:21:13] <initself> it is
[13:21:51] <initself> i always forget that jQuery just does what you want it to do without worrying about data stuctures
[13:21:55] <initself> it's an amazing language
[13:23:34] <initself> .find('option[value="Y"]:selected')
[13:23:37] <initself> does that get me selected?
[13:23:57] <initself> doesn't seem to
[13:24:05] <NoiseEee> drop the [value="Y"]
[13:24:19] <initself> but N might be selected?
[13:24:40] <NoiseEee> you'll find out what's selected because it will be returned by .find('option:selected')
[13:24:54] <initself> oh!
[13:24:58] * initself tries.
[13:25:11] <NoiseEee> var selectedValue = <etc>.find('option:selected').val()
[13:26:06] <initself> right, this is returning objects, so .val gives me the value
[13:26:32] <initself> hrm.
[13:26:44] <NoiseEee> that being said, you can just get the value with $(selectElementReference).val()
[13:26:53] <initself> one thing i am not disclosing is that my select box is multivalued
[13:27:08] <initself> mbb_main_flag.0, mbb_main_flag.1, etc
[13:27:10] <djQuery> now if you have multiple selects with the same name you need to loop through them
[13:27:20] <initself> shit, sorry for keeping that a secret
[13:27:24] <initself> that's where i thought grep came in
[13:27:27] <NoiseEee> then  $(selElement).val()  *should* return an array of values?   test
[13:29:24] <initself> in console.log it returns "function()"
[13:29:35] <initself> console.log($('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"]').val);
[13:29:40] <initself> is that what you mean by element?

[13:40:35] <NoiseEee> initself: first ask what you actually want.  it became unclear.  are you just asking for the selected option values of a <select>?  if not, what do you want to know?
[13:40:36] <initself> NoiseEee: maybe i just need each?

[13:45:49] <initself> just trying to see if any of those contain a Y
[13:45:55] <dadleyy> also, Image elements have a ".src" property
[13:46:19] <BillCriswell> troop: Besides that being the word variable name ever for what it's saving, it'll work.
[13:47:07] <troop> BillCriswell dadleyy it works i checked with alert
[13:47:10] <initself> NoiseEee: I dont want the user to be able to submit if there aren't any Y values.

[13:49:56] <thisboy> it sure is. would never have been able to do this on my own though..
[13:50:02] <rmill> That imagesLoaded thingy seems kinda finicky.
[13:50:11] <thisboy> rmill: thanks a lot
[13:50:22] <rmill> thisboy: NP!
[13:50:27] <thisboy> yeah not quite sure why its there even
[13:50:33] <troop> BillCriswell thanks for help. it works fine for me
[13:50:36] <thisboy> was there in all the masonry / isotope examples so
[13:50:39] <BillCriswell> troop: Groovy.
[13:50:55] <NoiseEee> initself: $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"] option[value="Y"]:selected')    <-- if that is empty/no results, then a "Y" was not selected / do not submit
[13:51:02] <rmill> thisboy: it's because DOM ready != imagesLoaded
[13:51:10] <thisboy> rmill: hey we're getting together over at http://www.fourseasons.com/borabora/ in a couple of weeks time, care to join us?
[13:51:20] <thisboy> we can pay for your hotel stay and food
[13:51:20] <rmill> thisboy: if you uncomment that size call that's lower, you'll see why you need imagesLoaded in there

[13:51:57] <initself> NoiseEee: didn't know you could write something like that
[13:52:10] <BillCriswell> I learned today that Bora Bora is a real place.
[13:52:11] <NoiseEee> initself: really its just a long selector....
[13:52:17] <thisboy> nice
[13:52:38] <NoiseEee> initself: <select> elements starting with that name, then all the options with a value of "Y" but restrict to the ones :selected
[13:56:29] <rmill> thisboy: Do they have wheelchair access?
[14:00:41] <thisboy> rmill: yes
[14:01:02] <alaing> hi can I pass in ui as part of .on?
[14:01:24] <systemfault> ui?
[14:01:42] <BillCriswell> "THESE TERMS OF USE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE" how is this fair at any point?
[14:01:43] <thisboy> rmill: sorry to hear you're temporarily immobilized though :/
[14:01:44] <alaing> .on('mycustom',function(event,ui){})
[14:01:59] <rmill> thisboy: I'm actually just kidding. I'm a dick.
[14:02:02] <rmill> Please ignore me.
[14:02:12] <systemfault> BillCriswell: It's a bad joke :P
[14:02:29] <BillCriswell> rmill: They just put some bad ass dune buggy tires on your wheel chair.
[14:02:36] <BillCriswell> systemfault: Haha I wish!
[14:02:37] <systemfault> alaing: You can use custom events with .on, yes
[14:02:46] <systemfault> alaing: What is ui though?
[14:04:10] <alaing> ui shoudl be the options that are triggered from a plugin
[14:04:39] <alaing> this._trigger('mycustom',null,options)
[14:09:47] <alaing> how do I pickup the options?
[14:11:26] <systemfault> this._trigger('mycustom', [null, options]);
[14:11:46] <systemfault> You'd have a this.on('mycustom', function (event, arg1, arg2) {} );
[14:13:34] <alaing> systemfault: in your example why the null in the array?
[14:13:48] <systemfault> alaing: I looked at your code.
[14:13:54] <alaing> so I shouldn't use .on('mycustom',otpions,function(event){})?
[14:14:12] <systemfault> That would also work I guess.
[14:14:14] <alaing> Oh but thats not in the options array
[14:14:33] <systemfault> Just look at the documentation for .trigger
[14:14:38] <alaing> I tried that but it reckon options is not defined
[14:14:58] <alaing> but this is using _trigger
[14:15:41] <alaing> coudl that be the issue
[14:15:54] <alaing> _trigger is an private function?
[14:16:11] <initself> NoiseEee: this is matching
[14:16:12] <initself> if ( $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"] option[value="Y"]:selected') ) {
[14:16:16] <initself> but returns
[14:16:27] <initself> console.log($(this).val()); // an empty string
[14:16:47] <initself> i dont understand why it would return an empty string rather than not returning anything
[14:16:54] <initself> oh
[14:17:00] <initself> because it selecting selected!
[14:17:05] <initself> and it isn't filled....
[14:17:16] <initself> so i need to check for it
[14:17:20] <NoiseEee> initself: its returning an array of elements that match the selector; it will either be empty or filled with matches
[14:17:44] <initself> NoiseEee: so it isn't actually returning the empty value in selected="" ?
[14:18:29] <NoiseEee> its returning an array of selected <option> elements with the value of "Y" that are in <select> elements that have names starting with "mbb_main_flag"
[14:19:10] <initself> NoiseEee: so putting it inside an if() doesn't make a lick of sense then
[14:19:19] <NoiseEee> no
[14:19:23] <initself> initself--
[14:19:25] <naeluh> Can anyone help me figure this technique out? the way the hover works on the people where it show more info on hover and scale http://unfold.no/#/people thanks
[14:19:52] <NoiseEee> if ( $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"] option[value="Y"]:selected').length>0 ) { //hooray we have a match, submit the form!!!! }  @ initself
[14:20:12] <initself> got it
[14:20:19] <NoiseEee> conversely, if ( $('select[name^="mbb_main_flag"] option[value="Y"]:selected').length===0 ) { //DO NOT SUBMIT }
[14:20:47] <Nece228> is there a way to swap dom with its elements except leave one attribute untouched?
[14:21:17] <initself> NoiseEee++
[14:24:04] <systemfault> Nece228: What does that mean?
[14:24:28] <relipse> how do i iterate through form fields and reset to empty?
[14:24:56] <systemfault> relipse: You can call .reset() on the form IIRC, that will reset it all
[14:25:43] <snax> moin.
[14:25:59] <snax> looking for the most simple way to highligh table columns upon mouse over (for tables of any number of rows).
[14:26:19] <relipse> systemfault: is that a jquery function or no?
[14:26:32] <systemfault> DOM and jQuery IIRC
[14:27:08] <systemfault> I can't remember :(
[14:27:34] <systemfault> If it's not jquery then just call it on the DOM Node, that I'm sure it will work
[14:27:40] <systemfault> myForm[0].reset();
[14:30:11] <relipse> the problem with reset...
[14:30:21] <relipse> it resets it to whatever it started as
[14:30:23] <relipse> instead of clearing it
[14:30:24] <M4d3L> how I get the offset of element depending on parent item?
[14:30:37] <BillCriswell> relipse: That's what .reset() is supposed to do.
[14:30:41] <relipse> M4d3L: .child().child()....
[14:31:01] <relipse> BillCriswell: how do i iterate through all form fields and just set them to empty?
[14:31:56] <BillCriswell> relipse: Yes.
[14:32:06] <BillCriswell> relipse: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6364289/clear-form-fields-with-jquery
[14:32:12] <Nece228> systemfault: i want to do something like "$(this).find('a', 'name', 'width').replaceWith($(this).prev().find('a', 'name', 'width'))"
[14:32:44] <Nece228> dont touch any other attributes
[14:32:51] <Nece228> they shuold be as they were
[14:33:15] <BillCriswell> relipse: If you have checkboxes that you want to clear you'll need to add a little more.
[14:33:43] <relipse> ok i think the answer is simple
[14:33:54] <relipse> $(form.elements).each(function(){ });
[14:33:58] <relipse> correct?
[14:34:04] <systemfault> yeah
[14:34:41] <BillCriswell> relipse: The link I posted might be better. If you run .val() on a checkbox might get weird?
[14:34:56] <relipse> BillCriswell: thats why i made this function!!!: https://github.com/relipse/Javascript-SetFormElementValue/blob/master/SetFormElVal.js
[14:35:17] <relipse> Sets any form element value!! even checkboxes!
[14:35:27] <systemfault> How will it work for radio buttons?
[14:35:33] <relipse> those too
[14:35:54] <relipse> SetFormElementValue(form.myradio, 'bar');
[14:35:59] <relipse> will check the 'bar' radio box
[14:36:09] <relipse> if it exists, otherwise it will uncheck existing radio boxes
[14:37:02] <relipse> if you set a checkbox to '' it simply unchecks it!
[14:37:17] <Nece228> hmm, how to select multiple attributes with attr()? attr('a', 'name')?
[14:37:25] <relipse> you cant
[14:37:29] <relipse> attr() doesnt "SELECT"
[14:37:41] <relipse> it SETS and GETS
[14:37:55] <Eviltwin> It also only gets and sets one attribute at a time
[14:38:22] <BillCriswell> Nece228: You want .foo[attribute1=foo][attribute2=bar]
[14:38:23] <relipse> you can't have multiple attributes same name, if you do then i believe the first one stands
[14:39:14] <Nece228> ok
[14:39:29] <Nece228> thanks for explaing
[14:43:21] <relipse> is input type="email" supported in all major browsers? or should i be using type="text" ?
[14:43:46] <coldhead> you should be using type="email" and a shim for older browsers
[14:43:48] <BillCriswell> relipse: If the browser doesn't understand type="email" it'll fall back to type="text"
[14:43:48] <djQuery> relipse, yes it is supported
[14:43:50] <coldhead> to future proof them
[14:43:58] <djQuery> relipse, however it doesnt work on all
[14:44:09] <relipse> oh so type="email" is good to use?
[14:44:33] <coldhead> use it with a shim
[14:44:34] <djQuery> relipse, anytime a browser see an input type that it doesn't recognize it treats it as if it were type=text
[14:44:53] <coldhead> https://github.com/dsheiko/HTML5-Form-Shim
[14:45:43] <Nece228> $(this).parents('tr:first').find('img').attr('src').replaceWith($(this).parents('tr:first').prev().find('img').attr('src'))
[14:45:49] <Nece228> why this doesnt work?
[14:45:58] <Nece228> i cant replace values of src attribute
[14:46:41] <djQuery> Nece228, well you need to get the string first then do the replace then do a set again
[14:47:13] <djQuery> Nece228, don't think replace is what u think it is
[14:47:16] <djQuery> ?replace
[14:47:22] <Nece228> or can i use just replaceAttr()?
[14:47:53] <BillCriswell> Nece228: If you have a replaceAttr function you wrote, sure.
[14:47:58] <djQuery> still got to get it first then massage it then set
[14:48:28] <djQuery> .attr does not return an object just a string with the attribute value right?
[14:48:52] <BillCriswell> Nece228: Are you updating an image in the current row with the source of the image in the row before it?
[14:49:12] <relipse> if I do: $(document.frmChangeEmail).submit(function(){ ... what is "this" ?
[14:49:20] <Nece228> yes
[14:49:28] <BillCriswell> relipse: Should be the form.
[14:49:34] <relipse> yeah but its not working
[14:49:36] <relipse> :(
[14:50:07] <Nece228> djQuery: so how should i convert it to object?
[14:51:04] <BillCriswell> Nece228: $(this).parents('tr:first').find('img').attr('src', $(this).parents('tr:first').prev().find('img').attr('src')); should work. I'd really consider rewriting that... impossible to read.
[14:51:47] <Nece228> BillCriswell: yeah i put it in variables
[14:52:05] <BillCriswell> Nece228: I did change the code.
[14:52:24] <Nece228> BillCriswell: yes i see, im gonna try now
[14:55:04] <BillCriswell> Nece228: I think this is easiest to read: http://pastie.org/pastes/6048285/text
[14:57:07] <BillCriswell> Nece228: Ehh.. questionably.. maybe not easiest to read but most flexible.
[14:57:36] <FunnyLookinHat> I've got a click listener that needs to confirm with the user before continuing... I used e.preventDefault() to stop the action from occurring, but is there a way to allow it to occur afterwards if ( confirm('whatever') ) returns true ?
[14:57:59] <Nece228> BillCriswell: thanks for tips
[14:58:18] <BillCriswell> FunnyLookinHat: if(!confirm('whatever')) e.preventDefault();
[14:58:33] <relipse> is there a way to $.getJSON() with POST variables instead?
[14:59:03] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.

[17:47:04] <jackp10> perhaps someone can point me to the right direction
[17:48:08] <jackp10> I am trying to achieve that animation where I have a div with height 0px at the very center of the page, and when I click on a menu, that div opens vertically, equally above and below (as a curtain)
[17:48:10] * gf3 points Westward towards the mountains
[17:48:42] <jackp10> I managed to increase the height, to change the position, but no luck on the animation I am actually looking for
[17:49:23] <gf3> jackp10: Wanna throw what you've tried so far on JSFiddle?
[17:49:33] <jackp10> sure.. just a sec
[18:00:06] <sayd> is there aplace to see whats comign in 2.0?

[18:07:10] <jackp10> here is what I have so far: http://jsfiddle.net/aFKMJ/
[18:07:29] <jackp10> as you can see, the div goes up and then expand

[18:16:04] <raj> it's also draggable though
[18:16:09] <raj> ^^ gf3
[18:18:08] <raj> gf3, sorry, additionally, the page needs to hvae a scrollbar
[18:20:11] <gf3> raj: That's not how position: fixed works
[18:20:33] <raj> what do you mean?
[18:20:40] <raj> I want it to stay at the same position while the page is scrolled
[18:21:10] <gf3> Well position fixed removes the element from the flow of the document, the page isn't going to have a scrollbar
[18:24:34] <raj> gf3, the page having a scrollbar is independent of #resizable being position:fixed
[18:24:58] <raj> when the page is scrolled, #resizable should not lose it's top/left configuration
[18:25:46] <raj> with .draggable() and .resizable() enabled on #resizable, it keeps switching back to position:absolute in the javascript

[18:46:28] <uman> Hi, if I take a user-entered string and pass it to .val on some form element, do I have to worry about escaping HTML special characters? Or does the fact that I'm interacting directly with the DOM mean that what's happening is taking place on a different level than HTML parsing and so I don't need to worry about it?
[18:46:43] <uman> let me know if the above comment got cut off by freenode; it was pretty long

[19:02:13] <coldhead> silent failure
[19:02:17] <coldhead> that's the beauty of it
[19:02:30] <coldhead> $('.not_existy').doStupidThings().allGood();
[19:02:43] <uman> so if I do elt.find('.keyword').val('blahblah') but there is nothing with class "keyword" under elt, it'll be ok?
[19:02:46] <uman> coldhead: ok thanks
[19:02:50] <coldhead> have fun!
[19:03:22] <uman> sorry, js/html/jquery/etc. beginner here :)
[19:03:28] <goddard> I have an accordion like function for a h3 tag and I have another link inside it how can I only trigger the accordion open function when clicking on everything, but the link?
[19:03:30] <djQuery> well as long as dostupidthings exists anyway
[19:03:32] <coldhead> no problemo
[19:03:38] <goddard> or stopping the open when clicking the link?
[19:04:55] <coldhead> goddard: something like http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/outerClick
[19:05:10] <coldhead> guh the demo has gone away
[19:05:16] <djQuery> $('h3').toggleClass('.showContents')    $('h3 span').click(function(e){ e.pstopPropogation();})
[19:06:32] <goddard> ok ill look into those methods
[19:10:03] <coldhead> i really need degrees of !important
[19:10:10] <coldhead> to show that somethings are !!important!!
[19:10:15] <coldhead> or !!*important*!!
[19:10:38] <grafi> xP
[19:10:58] <_zoggy_> you shouldnt ever use important
[19:11:06] <_zoggy_> thats a crude hack :x
[19:11:13] <grafi> but it could be important
[19:11:20] <coldhead> buddy when you inherit 10,000 lines of CSS from an app your CEO bought and it has to be live tonight
[19:11:21] <_zoggy_> har har
[19:11:23] <coldhead> you use !important
[19:11:25] <coldhead> liberally
[19:11:47] <_zoggy_> naa
[19:11:56] <_zoggy_> you just include a .css after all that crap with your overrides
[19:11:59] <coldhead> http://oli.jp/img/2011/important-inheritance.png
[19:12:13] <coldhead> that's me
[19:12:52] <coldhead> ha didn't realise that was by our own matjas
[19:12:57] <coldhead> that guy knows what's up
[19:16:24] <goddard> coldhead, djQuery here is kind of what i have so far http://pastebin.com/VbbTuPsa
[19:21:24] <goddard> actually i should just detect if when clicking on the h3 something more specific is clicked on
[19:21:45] <goddard> can i do if($(this).find("a").click()) ?
[19:27:24] <jrajav> coldhead: Oh, so you're one of those sick bastards that has the balls to put !important in actual CODE and not just in Firebug
[19:27:37] <jrajav> If you were on my team I'd chew you out from here to Kentucky
[19:28:27] <coldhead> if you were on my team you'd be too busy having your throat stomped on by management to trouble anyone about your "beautiful code"
[19:28:46] <coldhead> i'm having my throat stomped on right now and it does really go well with !important all the things
[19:28:58] <jrajav> Those who came before me thoroughly trained our management in agile, and gave us the channels to use it to make them not idiotic.
[19:29:08] <jrajav> The only good thing to result from agile
[19:29:28] <jrajav> But yeah, fuck existing code
[19:29:31] <coldhead> that must be lovely
[19:29:52] <grafi> hm that should be on a tshirt
[19:31:45] <djQuery> goddard, if yo uallready have all the ui stuff there why dont you just call accordian on it?
[19:32:31] <goddard> djQuery, I'm not that experienced yet I guess I haven't learned that trick
[19:32:32] <tw2113> coldhead *clap clap clap clap* coldhead
[19:33:22] <djQuery> goddard, see ?.accordian
[19:33:36] <djQuery> stupid lazy bot
[19:33:38] <goddard> i tried http://pastebin.com/FF9A8UGa
[19:33:43] <tw2113> ?accordion
[19:33:49] <goddard> its not an accordion object it is just similar
[19:34:06] <djQuery> goddard, http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[19:34:19] <djQuery> you can still have an accordion with only 1 item in it
[19:34:50] <djQuery> goddard, you just have to set the collapsible option to true
[19:34:55] <djQuery> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-collapsible
[19:34:58] <sunbeam> i have a <div with a class, that appears at a certain time in my site, when it does i would like to fire a certain action
[19:35:02] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do that?
[19:35:29] <djQuery> sunbeam, is there at the time the page is loaded or is it added by another process on the page
[19:37:17] <sunbeam> djQuery: added by another process
[19:37:43] <djQuery> sunbeam, another process that you have control over? otherwisenot that I am aware of
[19:41:12] <raj> would it be crazy to fit two divs adjacent to each other using js to size their widths?
[19:42:02] <coldhead> it wouldn't be your proudest moment
[19:42:07] <coldhead> but everyone does it
[19:42:29] <raj> div 1 adjusts its width/height to fit its content. div 2 should fit the rest of the browser's width http://imgur.com/8Y3avzV
[19:43:39] <raj> that can't be done with css afaik
[19:44:33] <raj> anyone concur?
[19:45:27] <woopwoop> what can I use to check if Object {data: Array[0]} is empty or not? eg. theres no arrays for 'data'
[19:45:39] <raj> .length?
[19:46:34] <woopwoop> heh
[19:46:35] <woopwoop> thanks
[20:05:09] <raj> to be able to list the green divs next to the red div, I put the green divs in a blue box. However, it only looks like this when the blue box has overflow:hidden, otherwise the first green box takes the height of the red box. http://imgur.com/1dfwHmv
[20:05:14] <raj> oops, wrong channel
[20:11:42] <initself> EVERYONE I SOLVED MY OWN PROBLEMS AND ONCE AGAIN I THANK JQUERY

[22:30:43] <Onkeltem> Hi all. After switching from jQuery 1.7 to 1.8 el.outerHeight() stopped working. Instead of a number it returns HTML now
[22:30:51] <Onkeltem> Can anybody explain why?
[22:31:47] <gf3> Onkeltem: It returns a number
[22:32:37] <Onkeltem> gf3: not in my setup though
[22:34:49] <gf3> Onkeltem: ORLY
[22:37:08] <gf3> Onkeltem: LIES
[22:37:31] <Onkeltem> gf3: as I said, it returns HTML instead of a number
[22:37:38] <gf3> It does not
[22:38:21] <tw2113> you're going to need to provide a demo/link to something
[22:38:36] <Onkeltem> Can an extension screw things so much?
[22:38:41] <Onkeltem> I'm on Chrome
[22:39:14] <Onkeltem> tw2113: its not easy...

[22:39:31] <devslash> I'm working on a web site that displays the contents of a directory on my server in a file tree using a jquery plugin called jQueryFileTree. it works fine on desktop and mobile devices but I'm thinking of creating a simpler layout for mobile devices. What I'd like to have is a scrollable list of all the artist name and when you select that it changes to that folder with the artist and displays albums and so on. any ideas how i can implement this ?
[22:39:43] <devslash> is there an existing jquery plugin for this type of thing ?
[22:40:30] <cyro> I'm pretty new to jquery
[22:40:39] <cyro> i'm trying to use data-attributes
[22:41:06] <cyro> i have a bunch of elements that are of the form <div class="foo" data-url="http://example.com/1"/>
[22:41:25] <cyro> I want to use jquery to get an array of all of the data-url attributes
[22:41:40] <cyro> whenever i do something like $("div.foo").data("url")
[22:41:56] <cyro> I only get the value of the data-url attribute for the first element that matches the selector
[22:42:02] <cyro> any tips?
[22:43:13] <Onkeltem> gf3: your example works, I see.
[22:43:29] <gf3> Onkeltem: I would never lie to you
[22:44:04] <Onkeltem> gf3: this means that extensions are not in charge :)
[22:44:46] <devslash> does anyone know how i can do this ?
[22:48:05] <cyro> anyone have a good blog post tutorial on how to retrieve data-attributes from many elements at once?
[22:49:31] <Cork> cyro: var list = $.map($('selector'), function(elm) { return $(this).data('name'); });
[22:50:12] <Cork> note: $().map != $.map
[22:50:34] <cyro> cork: I just tried that and I get an empty array
[22:50:46] <cyro> cork: maybe I typed something wrong
[22:50:50] <Cork> have you updated the selector strings?
[22:50:53] <cyro> let me double check
[22:50:55] <cyro> yea
[22:51:05] <cyro> $.map($('div.pie'), function(elm) { return $(this).data('url'); });
[22:51:12] <Cork> opps my error
[22:51:14] <Cork> replace this wiht elm
[22:51:46] <cyro> replace $(this) with elm?
[22:51:50] <Cork> $(elm)
[22:52:04] <cyro> genius!
[22:52:11] <cyro> thank you :)
[22:52:15] <Cork> np :)
[22:52:42] <cyro> there might be a better way of doing what I'm trying to do
[22:53:09] <Cork> ask and well see if anyone here as an idea :)
[22:53:10] <cyro> I want to create d3 charts and that data-url will be a link to the json data for the chart
[22:53:42] <cyro> that way I can just generalize to <div class="pie" data-url=" … ">
[22:53:45] <cyro> for any pie chart
[22:53:53] <cyro> that I want to add to my site
[22:54:05] <cyro> is there a cleaner way to do that?
[22:54:34] <Cork> not if you want to assign the data to the dom
[22:54:58] <Cork> at least not that i can think of
[22:55:07] <cyro> I'm trying to copy how in twitter bootstrap
[22:55:14] <cyro> you can just add urls as data attributes
[22:55:21] <cyro> and not have to write any other javascript
[22:55:39] <cyro> do i need to write  a jquery plugin for that
[22:55:46] <cyro> ?
[22:55:47] <Cork> well then you will have to loop the elements
[22:55:51] <Cork> there really isn't another way
[22:55:55] <cyro> ok
[22:56:09] <Cork> cyro: the plugin would do more or less what we just did anyway
[22:56:11] <cyro> i'm just using a jquery call to make an array of my data to pass off to d3
[22:56:18] <cyro> got it
[22:56:29] <cyro> thanks so much for your help
[22:56:31] <Cork> is the url meant to work back at the original element?
[22:56:40] <cyro> what do you mean?
[22:56:47] <cyro> for example
[22:56:53] <Cork> is the chart meant to be drawn one per div?
[22:56:57] <cyro> i might have a dashboard on /group/1
[22:57:07] <cyro> and then have /group/1/data.json
[22:57:13] <cyro> and /group/1/data2.json
[22:57:18] <cyro> yea
[22:57:20] <cyro> one chart per div
[22:57:29] <tw2113> mmmm d3
[22:58:03] <tw2113> i've used it to generically graph both student loan balances and also tweets
[22:58:11] <Cork> then it might be better to do  $('selector').each(function() { var data = $(this).data('url'); $(this).append(chart(url)); });
[22:58:17] <Cork> or what ever you plan on doing
[22:58:33] <Cork> kinda silly to first loop the selectors to find the data
[22:58:38] <Cork> and then loop it again to set it
[22:59:16] <Cork> (the append was just an example, not sure how you plan to add the charts)
[23:00:22] <cyro> ok
[23:00:44] <cyro> how do i use that in the middle of a d3 string
[23:00:45] <cyro> ?
[23:00:45] <Cork> but witch of those two options is the correct one, depends on what you need to do
[23:00:58] <Cork> what do you mean?
[23:01:08] <cyro> let me type in an example
[23:01:10] <cyro> give me a sec
[23:01:33] <cyro> i was going to do
[23:01:50] <cyro> data_urls = $.map($('div.pie'), function(elm) { return $(elm).data('url'); });
[23:02:03] <cyro> then do another map on that to do the ajax calls to get the json
[23:02:09] <cyro> so i have an array of json
[23:02:11] <Cork> cyro: please use jsfiddle
[23:02:11] <cyro> then
[23:02:27] <cyro> k
[23:06:06] <Onkeltem> gf3: I'd  like to switch to unminified version of jQuery on jsbin, how to do this?
[23:06:38] <gf3> Onkeltem: You're free to edit all the HTML/CSS/JS, so you'd just include a different version in the <head>
[23:06:48] <cyro> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/VpLnM/'
[23:06:55] <gf3> Onkeltem: http://jsbin.com/enoqem/1/edit
[23:06:56] <cyro> i was writing it in coffee script
[23:07:07] <cyro> so i'm not quite done putting it into js
[23:09:46] <cyro> cork: ithink changed it all to js now
[23:10:27] <Onkeltem> gf3: this is you gave still using jquery.min.js while I need to debug jQuery code
[23:10:44] <gf3> Onkeltem: Yeah man, I'm not updating it for you
[23:11:15] <Onkeltem> gf3: its odd, but I think I found the reason why outerHeight() returns elements instead of a number
[23:11:28] <Onkeltem> gf3: locally I even fixed this bug in jQuery
[23:12:00] <Onkeltem> in jquery.js 9383rd line: var chainable = arguments.length && ( defaultExtra || typeof margin !== "boolean" ),
[23:12:18] <Onkeltem> makes chainable TRUE for a call like: el.outerHeight()
[23:13:03] <Onkeltem> artuments array for some reason in this case has exactly one element (while I expected it to be of zero length)
[23:13:21] <Onkeltem> it has [0: undefined] content
[23:13:27] <Onkeltem> why? I don't know
[23:13:49] <Onkeltem> but adding one more check: && (arguments[0] !== undefined) makes outerHeight() to work
[23:14:05] <Cork> cyro: i think you missed parts there
[23:14:16] <Cork> cyro: all i see is <div class="pie
[23:14:38] <cyro> sorry forgot to hit update
[23:15:27] <Cork> cyro: ah, so you generate one big canvas for all the charts
[23:15:34] <Cork> so then ya, the first option is the correct one
[23:15:46] <mkoks> hello, can anyone help with making jquery autocomplete?
[23:16:04] <cyro> cork: so get the data first and then d3
[23:16:05] <cyro> ?
[23:16:18] <cyro> cork: thanks so much
[23:16:37] <Cork> cyro: unless i read the code wrong
[23:16:57] <Cork> i'm not completely where your adding the chart to the dom
[23:17:05] <Cork> *sure where you
[23:18:11] <Cork> cyro: or is that what you're doing here d3.selectAll("div.pie").append("svg:svg").data(data) ?
[23:18:18] <cyro> yea
[23:18:59] <Cork> and that append is a speciall call for your svg gemerator plugin?
[23:20:01] <cyro> cork: i think you should be able to see the pie charts now
[23:20:11] <cyro> cork: i had to delete a couple more coffee lines
[23:28:51] <Cork> cyro: link?
[23:30:19] <cyro> cork: sorry about that
[23:30:20] <cyro> http://jsfiddle.net/VpLnM/5/
[23:31:03] <Cork> interesting
[23:32:17] <Cork> ok, so d3 takes an array of data and will append the chart to the target on its own
[23:32:23] <Cork> so ya, the first solution is the correct one
[23:40:30] <greek> I stand to be corrected, but is the upgrade guide incomplete here: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#deprecated-add-and-remove-methods-and-events-use-refresh-method ?
