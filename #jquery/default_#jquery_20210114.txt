[09:22:58] <robertparkerx> I can't seem to find where the action is that changes a radio back when other option is selected
[09:23:09] <robertparkerx> I hate to ask but is there a way to stop all actions
[09:23:16] <robertparkerx> maybe override
[09:57:29] <Cork> robertparkerx: the browser does that
[09:57:37] <Cork> if you don't want the radio to be a radio use a checkbox
[09:58:44] <Cork> (by the browser i mean it isn't done by js)
[09:59:01] <Cork> <input type="radio" name="a" value=1">
[09:59:07] <Cork> <input type="radio" name="a" value="2">
[09:59:13] <Cork> will do it without anything else
[10:00:47] <robertparkerx> Cork it seems the radio is checked and if I check other value it goes back
[10:00:55] <robertparkerx> It seems like it is a script but I can't find it
[12:35:58] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx you're describing basic radio button behavior fwiw.
[12:41:43] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees maybe I am saying it wrong. I select one radio, it goes back to the other. I can't select any other radio. There are only two.
[12:42:20] <robertmaxrees> so one radio is selected, you click the other radio, and it goes back to selecting the first one?
[12:42:27] <robertparkerx> Yes
[12:42:52] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  sounds like some bad markup or validation or something.
