[00:02:12] * hellyeah searchin for jquery 1.91
[00:02:18] * hellyeah 1.9.1
[00:03:59] <rcyr> github?
[00:04:17] <rcyr> Why would you use 1.9.1 instead of the latest 1.x release?
[00:04:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:04:31] <hellyeah> is it in github?
[00:04:49] <hellyeah> rcyr:  my script doesnt work in i.e. 8
[00:05:04] <hellyeah> so i read i need jquery 1.9 and es5 shim.
[00:05:04] <rcyr> Ok..
[00:05:19] <rcyr> Doesn't make much sense but whatever.
[00:06:01] <hellyeah> i am noob
[00:06:14] <hellyeah> so
[00:06:22] <hellyeah> i just try to find a way to solve problems
[00:07:07] <hellyeah> i guess jquery 2.1 doesnt work on i.e. 8
[00:07:38] <SirLagz> hellyeah: why are you trying to write a script that will work on an old old browser anyway?
[00:09:08] <hellyeah> SirCmpwn:
[00:09:28] <hellyeah> company i am working for still use i.e. 8 i guess the plan to update i.e. 10
[00:09:41] <hellyeah> but this is really big company it takes time
[00:09:54] <rcyr> hellyeah: i.e. doesn't mean anything to use
[00:09:58] <rcyr> Write IE instead
[00:10:06] <rcyr> And 1.x all support IE8
[00:10:10] <rcyr> 2.x doesn't
[00:10:28] <hellyeah> i have 1.11
[00:10:36] <rcyr> Should be fine.
[00:10:40] <SirLagz> yeah was going to say, pretty sure jQuery 1.11.3 still supports IE
[00:10:51] <SirLagz> jquery 1.11 still supports IE6/7/8
[00:11:06] <rcyr> Unless you use old plugins that use deprecated/removed things... if that's the case, you need to include jquery migrate after jquery
[00:11:12] <hellyeah> 1.11.1
[00:11:43] <rcyr> hellyeah: If you get errors about $.browser or .live, you probably need "jquery migrate"
[00:11:47] <hellyeah> rcyr:  old plugins? you meant jquery 1.11.1 right
[00:11:58] <hellyeah> let me check the errors
[00:12:00] <rcyr> jQuery 1.11 itself works well with IE8
[00:12:49] <hellyeah> i.e. 8 dont have inspector damn
[00:13:13] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:13:20] <hellyeah> i drawn a circle in js
[00:13:26] <hellyeah> i.e. 8 couldnt show that
[00:13:35] <hellyeah> this is nightmare
[00:13:48] <hellyeah> also i.e. 8 have a problem with opacity
[00:17:23] <SirLagz> hellyeah: that's what happens when you use old browsers lol
[00:19:05] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  actually i am preferring to up to date chrome, chromium
[00:19:12] <hellyeah> firefox also has some quirks
[00:19:25] <hellyeah> but you know i am kind of developer
[00:19:38] <hellyeah> in my experience i saw many times here complaining about IE :D
[00:20:12] <STFUn00b> guys... any backbone expert around here maybe?
[00:23:07] <hellyeah> i got jquery error
[00:23:52] <hellyeah> object doesnt support this propery of method. line is var button = ("#button1");
[00:24:11] <hellyeah> any suggestion
[00:24:39] <SirLagz> hellyeah: you're missing a $ there
[00:27:35] <hellyeah> ops
[00:27:41] <hellyeah> sorry i forgot here
[00:27:45] <hellyeah> it was written there
[00:27:49] <rcyr> STFUn00b: Try asking.
[00:28:19] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  this is my code btw http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/74/
[00:32:37] <SirLagz> hellyeah: You're using appendto wrong
[00:32:50] <SirLagz> http://api.jquery.com/appendto/  <-- have you read the doco on appendto ?
[00:33:21] <SirLagz> hellyeah: only had a quick look so I could be wrong though
[00:34:41] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  let me take a look
[00:35:49] <hellyeah> SirLagz:  may i ask which line
[00:36:12] <SirLagz> hellyeah: Sorry, I've closed the code now
[00:36:23] <hellyeah> no problem
[00:36:36] <SirLagz> hellyeah: I'm a bit busy atm, I'll have a better look later
[00:36:46] <hellyeah> sure
[00:36:47] <hellyeah> thanks
[01:14:23] <sl33k_> How do I fetch this external JSON http://preview.sokrati.com/data/open_spendings.json ? JSONP doesn't seem to be enabled.
[01:14:50] <sl33k_> I added a callback query string to check as well
[01:16:27] <rcyr> sl33k_: If it doesn't support JSONP or CORS, you'll have no other choice but to fetch it server-side
[01:27:13] <tuskkk___> how do we get the data-list-name's value from multiple such tags? <p data-list-name="test" class="fs12 clr-dark list-name italic margin-none">Test</p>
[01:27:38] <tuskkk___> tried using the map given here, http://stackoverflow.com/a/15007218
[01:28:15] <rcyr> And?
[01:28:40] <tuskkk___> and it returned an empty array
[01:28:48] <rcyr> I hope you haven't just blindly pasted that crap?
[01:29:06] <rcyr> The solution is right.... but you cannot use .val()
[01:29:17] <tuskkk___> I changed the class
[01:29:23] <tuskkk___> oh
[01:29:29] <rcyr> $('.email').map( function(){return $(this).attr('data-list-name'); }).get();
[01:52:49] <hellyeah> any idea about that error

[04:49:45] <Pantalon> anyone around?
[04:50:48] <taplar> sup
[04:51:48] <Pantalon> hey
[04:51:49] <Pantalon> hmm
[04:52:02] <Pantalon> do i need to check proto to understand the type of object?
[04:52:21] <taplar> hmm?
[04:52:49] <hellyeah> hmm i am looking inspector
[04:53:24] <hellyeah> or
[04:53:29] <hellyeah> is it context?
[04:53:49] <taplar> not entirely sure what your asking
[04:55:20] <hellyeah> hm
[04:55:26] <hellyeah> i try to use forEach
[04:55:34] <hellyeah> and not understand why this didnt work
[04:55:37] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/4/
[04:55:51] <hellyeah> is it because of WebRequestGridView table is not an array
[04:56:02] <taplar> yes, forEach is for a basic array
[04:56:04] <hellyeah> so i just try to understand how i can check the type of object
[04:56:24] <taplar> anything wrapped in $() is a jquery object
[04:56:54] <taplar> you can either use .each() or break out of the jquery object with [0] or get()
[04:57:28] <hellyeah> .each instead of forEach this is what you said
[04:57:50] <taplar> but you only have one table so not sure why your doing an each
[04:58:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:58:07] <hellyeah> i just used for loop actually
[04:58:19] <hellyeah> someone told me write it with forEach dont use for loop
[04:58:42] <taplar> either way works.  it's just flavor at that point
[04:58:46] <taplar> imho
[04:59:28] <taplar> but what are you trying to loop over?
[05:01:06] <hellyeah> i will just try to check the colors in tr and change it so it is simple task. for example if it is red, do color something else
[05:01:21] <hellyeah> i am trying to loop over tbody tr
[05:01:33] <taplar> then you should modify your selector to reflect that
[05:03:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/5/ ?
[05:03:33] <taplar> yup, better
[05:03:51] <hellyeah> yes thats my aim
[05:04:10] <hellyeah> can i do tr
[05:04:19] <hellyeah> only tr because i have only one table
[05:04:25] <hellyeah> ops
[05:04:27] <hellyeah> tbody tr
[05:04:34] <hellyeah> there is tr in thead
[05:05:01] <taplar> yeah, that would work, though i'd leave the id selector there
[05:05:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:05:23] <taplar> but the id selector and table would not work, as the id is on the table.  there is no nested table in the table
[05:05:27] <hellyeah> there is the thing i do
[05:05:38] <hellyeah> yeah
[05:05:48] <hellyeah> sorry my mistake
[05:06:10] <hellyeah> sometimes i am doing obvious mistakes https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/6/
[05:06:35] <taplar> yep, now change your forEach to an each
[05:06:56] <hellyeah> ah forgot that :D
[05:07:09] <hellyeah> humm
[05:07:39] <hellyeah> i guess item is index right
[05:07:41] <hellyeah> humm
[05:07:52] <hellyeah> index number
[05:08:19] <taplar> the optional parameters for each is (index, element)
[05:08:29] <taplar> or you can leave them off and reference 'this'
[05:08:47] <hellyeah> ic
[05:09:00] <hellyeah> do you prefer assigning a variable before each https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/9/
[05:09:53] <hellyeah> it will be inside document.ready
[05:09:58] <hellyeah> this is not global var.
[05:10:07] <taplar> if i do it multiple times, yes.  probably for your case if i were to do a variable i'd do it on the table though.  more operations could be done from the table level than the trs.  but that's just my flavor
[05:10:36] <hellyeah> taplar:
[05:10:39] <hellyeah> you are master
[05:10:42] <hellyeah> i am student
[05:10:50] <taplar> we're all students, ;)
[05:11:00] <hellyeah> you are master student
[05:11:04] <hellyeah> i am bachalor student
[05:11:05] <hellyeah> :D
[05:11:21] <hellyeah> writer of ECMA script is phD student :D
[05:11:39] <taplar> i make a point to say it's flavor, because it's just an opinion.  i can't give you a solid reason why one is better than the other.  i just like it, :)
[05:11:59] <hellyeah> i would do it on the table what do you mean?
[05:12:13] <hellyeah> can you give me quick fiddle if you dont mind
[05:12:28] <taplar> so if you did your variable as: var table= $("#WebRequestGridView");
[05:12:49] <taplar> then you have many options from there.  you can find on that element for children.  you can alter it from there, etc.
[05:12:57] <taplar> all operating off of that prefound table
[05:13:27] <hellyeah> ic
[05:13:31] <taplar> but it's situational
[05:13:40] <hellyeah> hmm just a sec
[05:13:40] <taplar> if your not going to do those things, go as low as you can is good too
[05:14:03] <hellyeah> so you select td with jquery selector then
[05:14:15] <hellyeah> like child() siblings()
[05:14:26] <taplar> nah, just do another find() off the variable
[05:15:06] <taplar> var table= $("#WebRequestGridView");  var trs = table.find('tbody tr');
[05:15:19] <hellyeah> ic
[05:16:13] <hellyeah> does it make code readable?
[05:16:20] <hellyeah> do you think?
[05:16:54] <taplar> it could be more readable.  that though is mainly for reusability
[05:17:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:18:16] <hellyeah> if i write each instead of for loop will it give me any advantage on browser performance?
[05:18:49] <taplar> each will do some form of for behind the scenes for you
[05:19:07] <taplar> since you already have it in a jquery object, not really a performance los
[05:19:09] <taplar> loss
[05:19:28] <hellyeah> may be slight performance gain?
[05:20:17] <taplar> it's negligable at this point
[05:21:24] <hellyeah> i used c# six month for writing project
[05:21:34] <hellyeah> mmost of the thing in c# called as syntatic sugar
[05:21:51] <hellyeah> each is syntatic sugar?
[05:22:23] <taplar> it's a helper function, not really sugar
[05:22:36] <taplar> it removes some boiler plate for you
[05:22:50] <hellyeah> ic
[05:23:11] <hellyeah> actually i dont know much about boiler plate but it remove some bad cases if i understand truly
[05:23:45] <taplar> boiler plate is any code that you do over and over and over to accomplish what you want
[05:24:06] <taplar> extracting it into functions so you don't have to code it over and over is removing boiler plate
[05:24:07] * prohobo thinks of android dev and shudders
[05:24:35] <taplar> each, as a function of the jquery framework, removes some of the looping boiler plate of for loops
[05:24:36] <prohobo> the whole freaking app is boilerplate
[05:24:51] <hellyeah> what app?
[05:24:56] <hellyeah> :D
[05:24:56] <R13ose> I am getting this error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'default' of undefined" when I use this code: http://pastebin.com/yDe0xPNs to show videos, and thumbnails using YouTube API v3.  What am I doing wrong?
[05:24:56] <prohobo> every android app
[05:25:10] <hellyeah> ic
[05:25:23] <prohobo> nvm, im just hating on the android app dev workflow
[05:28:08] <hellyeah> thank taplar
[05:28:18] <hellyeah> i have to make my code better
[05:28:23] <hellyeah> it is ugly i guess
[05:28:24] <hellyeah> .D
[05:28:48] <taplar> nah, but could be more self documenting
[05:28:59] <taplar> for instance var table
[05:29:00] <hellyeah> humm
[05:29:09] <taplar> table could actually be the same as your id
[05:29:18] <hellyeah> do you prefer documenting inside function?
[05:29:20] <taplar> so you know 'what' table in your code, :)
[05:29:29] <taplar> self documenting code is awesome
[05:29:39] <hellyeah> ops
[05:29:51] <hellyeah> i supposed documenting is commenting about function
[05:30:09] <hellyeah> self-documenting you mean variable name that explains itself?
[05:30:15] <taplar> yes
[05:30:18] <hellyeah> ic
[05:30:19] <taplar> variables, function names, etc
[05:30:41] <hellyeah> can i do
[05:30:51] <taplar> i've heard it said before if you have to leave a comment about what a function is supossed to do, that's a smell
[05:30:54] <hellyeah> .each(nameoffunction(){
[05:31:13] <taplar> sure, let me find your fiddle again
[05:32:01] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/13/
[05:33:00] <taplar> ok, so here is with the variable name changed and also storing the table and finding on it: https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/15/
[05:34:08] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:34:15] <hellyeah> enshort the code that way
[05:34:21] <hellyeah> it seems nice
[05:34:35] <taplar> here's the function pulled out and with a descriptive name: https://jsfiddle.net/6nz3us4b/16/
[05:35:44] <taplar> you know which table you have, your finding the trs, and your evaluating the table row color, just from that one line
[05:35:54] <hellyeah> ic
[05:35:57] <taplar> 'how' your evaluating it, if you need to know, you can then lookup the function
[05:36:09] <taplar> but even if you don't do that, you logically have an idea what the program is doing
[05:36:23] <taplar> and even better
[05:36:28] <taplar> what it SHOULD be doing
[05:36:30] <taplar> :)
[05:36:43] <hellyeah> so
[05:36:46] <hellyeah> self documenting
[05:36:53] <taplar> == awesome sause
[05:37:10] * hellyeah ===
[05:37:14] <hellyeah> :D
[05:37:15] <taplar> :D
[05:37:44] <hellyeah> >>
[05:37:53] <hellyeah> btw
[05:38:00] <hellyeah> there are two issues dont understand
[05:38:06] <taplar> k
[05:38:10] <hellyeah> why we use === instead of ==
[05:38:17] <hellyeah> and why 2 * false give me 0
[05:38:28] <hellyeah> or 2 + true give me three
[05:38:40] <taplar> ok, it involves javascripts use of coersion, i believe is the right term
[05:38:58] <taplar> so take the number 2 and the character "2"
[05:39:05] <taplar> different, yes?
[05:39:09] <hellyeah> sure
[05:39:16] <hellyeah> 2 + "2" give me "22"
[05:39:19] <hellyeah> btw
[05:39:24] <hellyeah> it is different
[05:39:34] <taplar> if you use ==, javascript will try to coerce the equality
[05:39:40] <taplar> 2 == "2" is true
[05:39:56] <hellyeah> humm
[05:40:00] <hellyeah> thats not true
[05:40:01] <taplar> javascript sees that their types are different, it tries to change them into the same type, it can, so it does, and it's true
[05:40:06] <hellyeah> but javascript make it true?
[05:40:09] <taplar> yep
[05:40:18] <hellyeah> why js do this?
[05:40:20] <taplar> === on the other hand says, don't do that
[05:40:24] <hellyeah> does it make sense?
[05:40:28] <taplar> *shrug* don't know what it's origin is, but it does
[05:40:35] <hellyeah> eheh
[05:40:42] <hellyeah> so wacky language somewhat
[05:40:42] <hellyeah> :D
[05:40:45] <taplar> probably has something to do with the var being a generic variable type
[05:40:59] <hellyeah> ic
[05:41:16] <taplar> so === not doing coersion
[05:41:22] <taplar> 2 === "2" is false
[05:41:24] <hellyeah> so js try to pretend same for every tyoe in run time
[05:41:32] <hellyeah> when you use ==
[05:41:44] <taplar> it will try to convert types to make it true, yes
[05:41:44] <hellyeah> i got it
[05:42:06] <hellyeah> actually understanding the thing that happened is easy
[05:42:21] <hellyeah> but understand the reason of that is sometimes impossible
[05:42:36] <hellyeah> i am not sure writers of language knows everycase in language
[05:42:44] <taplar> heh, so long as it does what you expect, and gives you the desired result, does it matter? ;)
[05:43:11] <hellyeah> i can be fine with it
[05:43:12] <hellyeah> :XD
[05:43:17] <hellyeah> i am just consumer
[05:43:18] <taplar> well, instead of 'does what you expect' maybe i should say 'is consistent'
[05:43:47] <hellyeah> my origin is java
[05:44:11] <hellyeah> so javascript behaivour is inconsistent "may be"
[05:44:12] <hellyeah> but
[05:44:22] <R13ose> Any thoughts on my question?
[05:44:25] <hellyeah> loose type, dynamic language brings me something new for sure
[05:44:36] <taplar> :)
[05:44:37] <hellyeah> c# has expando object
[05:44:41] <hellyeah> i need to discover
[05:44:55] <hellyeah> jdunno java has something for making dynamic
[05:45:15] <taplar> R13ose: couldn't tell myself.  others may know
[05:45:18] <hellyeah> but if i understand the reason why js is dynamic, here it is
[05:45:42] <R13ose> taplar: should I repost the question?
[05:46:00] <hellyeah> you have to stuff on runtime with js and interact with css and html.
[05:46:02] <hellyeah> anyway
[05:46:05] <SierraKilo> taplar hellyeah just caught end of your discussion and learned more about === in a few lines than pages on SO. Thanks
[05:46:09] <hellyeah> that jus confusing
[05:46:10] <taplar> maybe give it abit.  if they're not already here lurking others will be arriving after a while
[05:46:18] <taplar> SierraKilo: ^_^
[05:46:51] <hellyeah> static type - loose type
[05:46:56] <R13ose> taplar: like when?
[05:46:59] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:47:02] <hellyeah> anyway
[05:47:04] * hellyeah brb
[05:47:23] <taplar> R13ose: one of the guys usually starts commenting in a couple hours i believe
[05:47:31] <taplar> feel free to repost though
[05:48:06] <R13ose> okay
[05:48:11] <SierraKilo> Actually while i'm here, can i store js vars in browser of mobile even when screen on and off or do I have to use local storgage?
[05:49:00] <R13ose> Error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'default' of undefined" when I use this part of my code: http://pastebin.com/yDe0xPNs to show videos, and thumbnails using YouTube API v3.  What am I doing wrong?
[05:50:01] <taplar> SierraKilo: not sure.  local storage, if available for mobile, seems like it would work
[05:50:13] <taplar> not really a mobile guy myself
[05:50:56] <SierraKilo> it would work that way on desktop, yes? Go away, come back don't reload browser and vars still populated?
[05:51:05] <notchris> If I’m adding a variable in a loop, and the value are integers, why are they returning NaN?
[05:51:23] <notchris> I’m using: total += parseInt(price);
[05:51:27] <taplar> local storage will keep a variable for the life of the browser, is removed when the user closes the browser
[05:51:49] <taplar> depending on how you use it, it is also kept/destroyed across/by browser tab
[05:52:03] <MarkyC> notchris: it's possible your are calling parseInt('')
[05:52:27] <SierraKilo> trial and error I suppose.
[05:52:32] <MarkyC> notchris: total += parseInt(price) || 0;
[05:52:47] <taplar> notchris: shortcut parse is also +"2"
[05:53:01] <taplar> total += +price;
[05:53:15] <notchris> Still get NaN
[05:53:25] <taplar> then something is up with your price i would think
[05:53:39] <MarkyC> notchris: price is the problem then
[05:53:48] <notchris> Price is an array
[05:53:50] <taplar> or total.  you do initialize total to 0 yes
[05:53:51] <taplar> ?
[05:54:02] <notchris> var price = this[2].substring(2);
[05:54:07] <notchris> So if i log price, I get
[05:54:22] <notchris> 21.95, 39.90, 44.85
[05:54:33] <notchris> 3 values that should be able to be added
[05:55:01] <taplar> what about total?
[05:55:14] <notchris> total is declared outside the loop
[05:55:14] <notchris> as
[05:55:17] <notchris> var total;
[05:55:21] <notchris> and in the loop
[05:55:25] <notchris> total += price;
[05:55:30] <taplar> initialize total as 0
[05:55:49] <taplar> null + Number is probably NaN
[05:56:25] <notchris> Hmm
[05:56:27] <notchris> I think it worked
[05:56:31] <notchris> Let me add them manually
[05:57:15] <notchris> Weird
[05:58:03] <notchris> I got 104 in console
[05:58:10] <notchris> But I did the math out and got 106.7
[05:58:11] <notchris> :/
[05:58:16] <taplar> if your doing parseInt you getting an int
[05:58:23] <notchris> I need to do fixed 2
[05:58:36] <notchris> or float rather
[05:58:45] <notchris> Yep! parseFloat worked
[05:59:51] <taplar> notchris: https://jsfiddle.net/fdfhcem8/
[05:59:58] <notchris> I got it worked :D
[06:00:00] <notchris> working*
[06:00:02] <taplar> :)
[06:00:07] <notchris> Thank you taplar :)
[06:00:21] <taplar> cool.  since i learned about + personally i stopped using parseInt and parseFloat
[06:00:42] <taplar> i don't care what it is, just parse it! :D
[06:01:25] <notchris> :D
[06:02:19] <taplar> food run, afk
[06:02:23] <notchris> Mmmk
[06:02:24] <notchris> http://puu.sh/jfYKD/d8120133b5.png
[06:02:25] <notchris> :D
[06:08:04] <taplar> notchris: sweet
[06:08:10] <notchris> :D
[06:10:50] <Koopz> am i theoretically able to set default options with every jquery plugin?
[06:11:38] <taplar> it's my experience most jquery plugins allow you to pass in default options on initialization
[06:12:22] <taplar> given the number of plugins though, my breath of usage is small though
[06:12:48] <notchris> I’m declaring an array before an each statement
[06:12:58] <notchris> And the each statement is only showing the last item of the array
[06:13:06] <notchris> Even though it’s looping through array items
[06:13:24] <taplar> fiddle?
[06:14:24] <notchris> Hmm
[06:16:57] <Koopz> meh... doesn't look like Bootstrap Datepicker has a defaults object...
[06:17:53] <Koopz> just wanted to set some default options so i don't need to pass the options each time i'm initializing a Datepicker
[06:18:02] <taplar> ooooh
[06:18:10] <taplar> hah, yeah, probably not
[06:18:36] <Koopz> DataTables supports this kind of "hacking"
[06:19:02] <taplar> in one of my projects we had common configurations stored in vars and we passed in the vars so we wouldn't have to duplicate the config all over the place in the inits
[06:21:18] <notchris> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/358k8uww/
[06:21:33] <Koopz> huh... could do that too... aight...
[06:22:16] <notchris> Could edit the datepicker plugin
[06:22:32] <taplar> notchris: your 'this' is always the same
[06:22:42] <notchris> Hmmm
[06:23:31] <hellyeah> hey again
[06:23:37] <notchris> taplar: How do I fix that?
[06:23:51] <taplar> notchris: what is your intended results?
[06:24:03] <notchris> instead of five in each row
[06:24:05] <notchris> it should be
[06:24:09] <notchris> one,two three, four five
[06:24:14] <notchris> in that column, in each trow
[06:24:17] <notchris> row
[06:24:24] <taplar> notchris: use the index to get the specific tr
[06:24:41] <hellyeah> two for is possible
[06:24:45] <Koopz> as an oop php developer i'm not gonna edit any 3rd party code and always try to extend things o3o
[06:24:47] <hellyeah> one for tr one for td
[06:25:12] <hellyeah> foo[td][5]
[06:25:24] <hellyeah> ops
[06:25:29] <hellyeah> foo[tr][5]
[06:25:37] <hellyeah> fifth td of tr
[06:26:18] <taplar> hellyeah: that pattern would say of the object foo, get the parameter that matches the value of the variable 'tr', and of that get the 5th element
[06:26:25] <notchris> $('#user tbody tr td:nth-child(1)').eq(i).html(value);
[06:26:27] <notchris> Did not work lol
[06:26:28] <taplar> err, 6th element, 0 offset
[06:26:44] <taplar> notchris: use your nth-child selector on your tr
[06:26:59] <taplar> you'll have to concat in your index, possibly modified
[06:27:11] <notchris> Hmm
[06:27:47] <hellyeah> yes
[06:27:55] <hellyeah> tr:nth-child(1)
[06:28:30] <hellyeah> taplar is it logal? because i want to calculate total line of text
[06:28:52] <hellyeah> i have several paragraph these pararaphs is child of a td for example
[06:29:01] <hellyeah> several tr i mean
[06:29:18] <hellyeah> several tr child of td i want to calculate the line
[06:30:10] <taplar> hellyeah: i'd use finders to do that instead of breaking it out into basic arrays
[06:30:48] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/358k8uww/
[06:31:31] <taplar> notchris: use your index on your tr selector as i mentioned above
[06:31:35] <notchris> IT worked
[06:31:40] <notchris> It works in that exampke :D
[06:32:01] <taplar> i still see five over and over
[06:33:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  finders?
[06:33:32] <taplar> $(selector).find(secondSelector)
[06:33:45] <taplar> or jqueryObject.find(selector)
[06:34:08] <hellyeah> ic
[06:35:10] <pi-> I'm trying to map the computer keyboard to a MIDI piano, so I'm trying to trap key down/up events.  What's my best play?
[06:35:31] <pi-> I've got a SO Page telling me to avoid $(document).keypress http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17412033/jquery-up-key-down-key-keypress-detection-not-working
[06:36:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:36:12] <pi-> And an article (http://www.javascripter.net/faq/keycodes.htm) telling me certain keys such as '+' '-' get recognised differently by different browsers
[06:36:26] <hellyeah> can i create two buttons my table has two rows? http://jsfiddle.net/ckwL3w59/
[06:36:30] <Germanaz0> mousewheel + firefox for windows = sucks
[06:36:36] <Germanaz0> nice combination
[06:37:06] <hellyeah> let me do smt
[06:37:31] <taplar> pi-: you might try the input event
[06:38:18] <taplar> though that may only fire on input elements
[06:39:34] <taplar> hellyeah: sure?  not sure I understand the question
[06:39:50] <hellyeah> my table has two rows
[06:40:01] <hellyeah> i want to create button for each row
[06:40:12] <hellyeah> when you click button it will hover spesific row
[06:40:19] <hellyeah> i am just trying something
[06:40:24] <hellyeah> dunno that make sense
[06:40:31] <jayjo> Can I select multiple elements with a jquery selector?
[06:40:53] <taplar> jayjo: yes, either with a class or you can separate matchers with a comma
[06:41:00] <taplar> the comma being in the string
[06:41:08] <taplar> $('div, span')
[06:41:17] <jayjo> Oh ok, comma outside the string is different right?
[06:41:34] <taplar> that would be giving the function two elements vs the single matcher
[06:41:42] <taplar> not sure how it would treat that
[06:41:53] <taplar> but the comma in the selector works as a logical or
[06:42:18] <taplar> hellyeah: sure, create your buttons and bind your event handler to them
[06:42:38] <VectorX> hi if anyone knows, i am using bootstrap scrollspy and my menu item has the entire url ie http://domain.com/#section , the plugin isnt adding the active class in this instance how do i get it to work ? it would work if the url was just #section ?
[06:42:38] <hellyeah> create.documentElement
[06:43:01] <taplar> hellyeah: why not put the buttons directly in your markup?
[06:43:13] <hellyeah> well
[06:43:56] <hellyeah> my aim if table has a certain amount of line for example 50 lines, create 5 button and connected with 10 rows each.
[06:44:12] <hellyeah> button1 button2 button3 button4 button5
[06:44:26] <hellyeah> when you click one of them you will see ten row
[06:44:39] <R13ose> If I have maxResults=50 in a URL within jQuery.getJSON, how do I pull that out and use that to tell an each statement that I only want the each done that number of times?
[06:44:39] <hellyeah> so there wont be a scrolling
[06:45:05] <kingfisher64> does anyone know of a jquery script which allows random background images to be displayed at a certain breakpoint? So the script references one image folder below at one resolution and another at a higher res.
[06:45:32] <kingfisher64> i'm no jquery expert, my limits would be implementing it/v basic changes not creating one
[06:47:07] <taplar> hellyeah: that sounds like something jquery ui already does
[06:47:25] <hellyeah> taplar:  i can have 100 records
[06:47:34] <taplar> hellyeah: https://jqueryui.com/tabs/
[06:47:35] <hellyeah> so i need to devided 10,10,10,10
[06:47:40] <hellyeah> humm
[06:47:43] <hellyeah> let me check
[06:48:20] <taplar> or as an alternative, datatabes also has paging built in
[06:48:29] <taplar> *datatables
[06:51:12] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats nice
[06:51:35] <hellyeah> but people who observes table doesnt like that solution
[06:51:48] <hellyeah> and they observer many system tables at the same time
[06:52:05] <hellyeah> taplar:  that why i added counter http://jsfiddle.net/r7yeggck/74/
[06:52:30] <hellyeah> this shows how many red or orange or gray records are in table
[06:52:53] <hellyeah> they need to check all table or clicking tabs
[06:53:20] <hellyeah> think about million of records thats the real case
[06:53:42] <taplar> if your displaying millions of records I think your going to run into a performance issue
[06:54:18] <hellyeah> taplar it is my opinion
[06:54:26] <hellyeah> if i devide table into small parts
[06:54:30] <hellyeah> and bind to a button
[06:54:37] <hellyeah> it wont be a problem
[06:54:41] <hellyeah> i think
[06:54:52] <taplar> it's not an issue with the display size
[06:54:59] <hellyeah> because in first place dom is loaded without dialog box right
[06:55:03] <taplar> it's an issue with them being in your browsers memory and it having to deal with them
[06:55:19] <hellyeah> hmm i understood that point
[06:55:31] <hellyeah> but dialog box is loaded when page first loads
[06:55:47] <hellyeah> or dialog box is loaded after clicking button
[06:56:21] <hellyeah> memory of browser will be freed after closing popup box?
[06:56:29] <taplar> so are you saying your going to be loading the million+ records into their browsers, or are you saying your going to be fetching smaller subsets?
[06:57:00] <hellyeah> yes
[06:57:10] <hellyeah> fetching small subsets bind to a button
[06:57:24] <hellyeah> when you click button this subsets is displayed in modal window
[06:57:28] <hellyeah> thats my plan.
[06:57:28] <taplar> ok, so not displaying millions, but smaller sets, one at a time
[06:57:51] <hellyeah> yes
[06:57:53] <hellyeah> like
[06:58:05] <hellyeah> million of records devided by 100
[06:58:09] <hellyeah> or 10000
[06:58:17] <hellyeah> we have 100 records
[06:58:29] <taplar> that's fine, :)  you were just fixing to make me cry for you if not, lol
[06:58:30] <hellyeah> it is smt like that
[06:59:03] <taplar> personally i'd stop at 100.  at some point your just throwing a wall of text at your users
[06:59:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  btw i am just a beginner and i  dont have enough algorithm past with javascript
[06:59:06] <hellyeah> :D
[06:59:35] <hellyeah> so issue is dividing tables into smaller subset and binding to the button
[06:59:38] <taplar> so this seems more like an ajax issue
[06:59:39] <hellyeah> does that sound right
[06:59:55] <hellyeah> why AJAX?
[07:00:05] <taplar> your dynamically getting subsets
[07:00:20] <taplar> so consider this
[07:00:38] <taplar> crap, afk a sec, standup time
[07:01:38] <hellyeah> ic
[07:01:49] <hellyeah> humm well
[07:01:54] <hellyeah> avoid full refresh ic
[07:04:08] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:04:12] <hellyeah> AJAX with jquery
[07:04:13] <hellyeah> ?
[07:07:24] <taplar> bak
[07:07:25] <taplar> ok
[07:07:32] <taplar> so consider this
[07:08:03] <hellyeah> let me check it out
[07:08:12] <hellyeah> jsbin supports ajax?
[07:08:33] <taplar> one ajax call to get the total number of records.  this lets you know how many pages/buttons you'll need, and a second one to get subsets of results based off of the page/range you want
[07:08:46] <taplar> haven't used jsbin myself
[07:09:36] <hellyeah> what about jsfiddle?
[07:09:55] <taplar> jsfiddle will do the ajax request, but they may fail if they hit cors issues
[07:10:23] <hellyeah> cors issues?
[07:10:43] <mdev> calling resource from different domain
[07:10:51] <taplar> browsers restrict you from making certain types of requests across different domains
[07:10:58] <taplar> for security purposes
[07:11:14] <mdev> JSONP allows it though
[07:11:26] <mdev> so basically if remote server spits out the right headers it'll work
[07:12:35] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp
[07:12:54] <mdev> is kind of a pain anyway
[07:13:05] <taplar> ?api jquery ajax
[07:13:07] <hellyeah> what is it?
[07:13:12] <taplar> !g jquery ajax
[07:13:20] <taplar> ?api jquery.ajax
[07:13:24] <taplar> grrr
[07:13:39] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[07:13:42] <mdev> I wrote a chat engine in javascript(socket.io and node.js) but it failed miserably on live deployment because the session cookie wasn't to it, reason was I specified www. instead of without for the domain
[07:13:52] <mdev> and technically www and without are seperate domains
[07:28:29] <R13ose> taplar: I figured out my problem.
[07:28:36] <taplar> cool
[07:28:54] <R13ose> taplar: do you want to know what was wrong?
[07:29:01] <taplar> sure
[07:29:13] <taplar> i don't have your link anymore though
[07:30:25] <R13ose> taplar: no worries, the problem was that one of the youtube videos were deleted so I had to check if the video I was trying to load had a thumbnail or not.  If not, return true.
[07:30:36] <taplar> ah
[07:31:09] <taplar> never coded for youtube myself.  only recreational use, :)
[07:31:37] <taplar> i like sad cat diaries
[07:31:43] <R13ose> taplar: no worries, I like learning and the site I put this on is my favourite site to do.
[07:32:10] <DeoSama> Super newb question: what's the easiest way to create a form in a modal window?
[07:32:39] <taplar> modal can have anything in it you want.  are you asking instead how to create a modal?
[07:33:12] <DeoSama> taplar, yeah, i guess. I created one in the past using some super hacked method, and really don't want to do that again. Are there any js libraries I could use to make it easier?
[07:33:21] <taplar> checkout jqueryui, https://jqueryui.com/dialog/
[07:36:15] <R13ose> taplar: thanks for looking into this anyways
[07:37:16] <hellyeah> wondering what should i write to url part  in jsfiddle?
[07:38:17] <taplar> hellyeah: if your experimenting/playing around with ajax you should probably do that with one of your own servers
[07:38:54] <taplar> unless you find some public facing api that you could play around with
[07:40:17] <hellyeah> found smt
[07:40:18] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/556/
[07:43:14] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:43:19] <hellyeah> it seems "doesnt work" but
[07:43:27] <hellyeah> it make sense to try like that http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/557/
[07:44:04] <taplar> test is not a valid url so it is probably erroring.  you can add an error callback to handle for it
[07:45:25] <hellyeah> original fiddle btw http://jsfiddle.net/danmana/y6XgY/
[07:51:25] <whoknows> hey there
[07:51:54] <hellyeah> do you know AJAX?
[07:52:17] <whoknows> quick question: how to trigger ajax request when there's new record in db? (ajax auto-update(w/o intervals))
[07:52:55] <taplar> whoknows: a server cannot trigger ajax
[07:53:05] <taplar> such a thing would require some form of long polling or websockets
[07:53:24] <whoknows> what about websockets method?
[07:53:36] <whoknows> (p.s. it's not a node app)
[07:53:49] <taplar> using websockets and server could send a message to the front end users when a record is created, yes
[07:54:01] <taplar> "and server" = "a server"
[07:54:16] <whoknows> do you have any specific tutorial for this?
[07:54:35] <taplar> outside of googling, not at the moment
[07:55:45] <hellyeah> taplar found the solution http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/559/
[07:55:51] <hellyeah> but click function didnt work
[07:56:46] <taplar> change .innerHTML to .html()
[07:57:54] <hellyeah> still no result taplar http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/560/
[07:58:13] <hellyeah> is that true?
[07:58:26] <taplar> no html() is a function like val()
[07:58:44] <hellyeah> ops
[07:58:46] <taplar> $(selector).html('new value')
[07:58:58] <hellyeah> ic
[07:59:00] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:59:03] <hellyeah> end of the day
[07:59:05] <hellyeah> i feel tired
[07:59:10] <taplar> heh
[07:59:47] <hellyeah> taplar:
[07:59:55] <hellyeah> do you suggest me to use "use strict"
[08:00:07] <taplar> hmm?
[08:00:33] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/561/ nothing changed or no complains at console
[08:01:35] <taplar> i think your actually wanting to set the value of the #log element
[08:01:36] <taplar> ?
[08:01:56] <taplar> your trying to set the inner html of a button
[08:02:01] <taplar> not really a valid thing
[08:03:49] <hellyeah> humm
[08:04:01] <hellyeah> i remembered i changed the text of button once
[08:04:06] <hellyeah> may be i am mistaken
[08:04:12] <taplar> that would be its value
[08:04:35] <taplar> val()
[08:04:56] <hellyeah> humm it worked
[08:05:14] <hellyeah> but i have to click button twice
[08:05:28] <taplar> it takes a little bit for the ajax to return
[08:05:39] <taplar> it doesn't bind until it does the success method
[08:05:41] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/y6XgY/563/
[08:06:23] <taplar> if you inspect the page and go to your network tab.  click the run button on the page and you'll be able to see in your network tab when the ajax request finishes
[08:06:37] <hellyeah> lemme check
[08:07:04] <hellyeah> this is graphic
[08:07:14] <hellyeah> i am not well experienced at inspector
[08:07:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:07:34] <hellyeah> okey it worked
[08:07:40] <hellyeah> i guess thats a start right?
[08:07:45] <taplar> yep
[08:07:48] <hellyeah> hehe
[08:07:58] <hellyeah> i like to start
[08:08:03] <hellyeah> hmm one more question
[08:08:17] <hellyeah> let say i have ten different function
[08:08:32] <hellyeah> do i need to put everything inside one success
[08:08:45] <hellyeah> or can i have multiple ajax request at same page
[08:09:20] <hellyeah> anyway
[08:09:22] <taplar> you can have as many ajax request going simultaneously as your browser will handle.
[08:09:25] <hellyeah> :D
[08:09:34] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:09:35] <taplar> having said that, any logic you want to happen on success, needs to be in the success
[08:09:35] <hellyeah> ic
[08:09:45] <taplar> be that directly or by function calls from the success
[08:10:01] <hellyeah> gotcha
[08:10:12] <hellyeah> devided table into subset in succes
[08:10:21] <hellyeah> ssuccess is self documentary
[08:10:21] <hellyeah> :D
[08:10:31] <hellyeah> imho
[08:10:39] <taplar> true, but you could still break that out into a function
[08:11:12] <taplar> var createTableSubsection = function(data) { ... };    $.ajax({ success: createTableSubsection });
[08:11:39] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:11:47] <hellyeah> varhumm
[08:11:53] <taplar> heh
[08:11:58] <hellyeah> so createTableSubsection is function name
[08:12:05] <taplar> yup
[08:12:07] <hellyeah> you give function name to success
[08:12:08] <hellyeah> i see
[08:12:30] <taplar> or just: function createTableSubsection(data) {}
[08:12:32] <taplar> whatever
[08:12:46] <hellyeah> ic
[08:13:30] <whoknows> okay, what about long-polling?
[08:13:42] <taplar> long polling would also work
[08:13:43] <hellyeah> what is that?
[08:13:59] <taplar> periodically issuing an ajax request to check for updates
[08:14:44] <robertmaxrees> unless you're looking for a push solution.
[08:15:00] <taplar> i told him about websockets, :)
[08:15:07] <robertmaxrees> that's another solution.
[08:15:49] <hellyeah> websockets to me?
[08:15:55] <taplar> to who
[08:15:58] <robertmaxrees> to whoknows
[08:16:06] <hellyeah> ic
[08:16:09] <whoknows> so..
[08:16:17] <hellyeah> !beer
[08:16:36] <whoknows> it will update all the records, instead of just carefully inserting new one
[08:16:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:16:57] <hellyeah> i am gone
[08:17:01] <hellyeah> good day
[08:17:06] <taplar> take care
[08:17:11] <hellyeah> thank you
[08:17:16] <hellyeah> thanks for enlighten me
[08:17:30] <taplar> what the room is here for
[08:17:38] <robertmaxrees> they're already gone haha
[08:17:53] <taplar> ah, i have joins and leaves turned off
[08:18:13] <shahin8r> $.ajax - success: function(data) only puts the response data once in the data variable, right? so the only way to get new data in data i need to do ajax request again?
[08:18:38] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r basically.
[08:19:11] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: oh. i've got a lot of ajax calls to do then :(
[08:19:29] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're trying to do.
[08:19:33] <robertmaxrees> because it's really basic.
[08:20:34] <shahin8r> inside success function just a if data.status == "ready".. and the api gives me that response whenever it's done processing
[08:20:49] <taplar> success is after it is done
[08:20:56] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .done() btw.
[08:21:16] <shahin8r> would it make any difference?
[08:21:29] <taplar> done includes success and error
[08:21:29] <robertmaxrees> gets you started with deferreds.
[08:21:36] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[08:21:42] <taplar> or am i thinking of always
[08:21:43] <robertmaxrees> .done() is only when it was successful.
[08:21:47] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of always.
[08:22:08] <shahin8r> no way around this but using settimeout and loop ajax request?
[08:22:19] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r around what?
[08:22:32] <shahin8r> updating the response in data variable
[08:22:34] <shahin8r> :)
[08:22:40] <robertmaxrees> that's a really strange way to think about it.
[08:22:51] <robertmaxrees> you could use a server-side push technology like socket.io
[08:23:07] <robertmaxrees> or some other long-polling setup.  otherwise, yeah, you need to recursively use timeouts.
[08:23:41] <shahin8r> is socket.io the standard approach for this?
[08:24:01] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[08:24:14] <robertmaxrees> because it all depends on what you're trying to make.
[08:24:57] <shahin8r> an video upload to external api and i want the response of when the api is done processing the video
[08:24:58] <gurke_> hi@all :)
[08:25:16] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r what API?
[08:25:31] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: http://wistia.com/doc/data-api
[08:25:38] <robertmaxrees> oh wistia :(
[08:25:44] <arup_r> I just want some suggestions from you guys.. I need create to payment gateway UI for MIGS.. I want to do validation on frontend itself. I find it should I use http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/Credit-Card-Validator-Plugin-with-jQuery.html for credit ..any good plugin you guys would recommend me ?
[08:25:59] <robertmaxrees> arup_r are you also doing validation onm the backend?
[08:26:17] <arup_r> I didn't plan anything
[08:26:25] <taplar> always do it on the backend
[08:26:26] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: why ":("
[08:26:29] <robertmaxrees> arup_r then do that first.
[08:26:30] <arup_r> ok
[08:26:31] <shahin8r> are they bad
[08:26:31] <taplar> don't trust the front end
[08:26:34] <robertmaxrees> you need backend validation first.
[08:26:41] <robertmaxrees> frontend cannot be trusted period.
[08:27:00] <taplar> especially when dealing with something like credit cards
[08:27:03] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r they're just a PITA to work with.  and it looks like you're curious about when the video finishes processing, right?
[08:27:13] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: yep
[08:27:21] <robertmaxrees> just call that information on pageload.
[08:27:31] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: rate limit :)
[08:27:32] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, yeah you'll need to use timeouts.
[08:27:40] <robertmaxrees> right, so you do it on pageload.
[08:27:45] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, cache that server-side.
[08:29:28] <arup_r> Ok I'll do both side backend
[08:29:33] <arup_r> and frontend
[08:29:40] <arup_r> any good plugins you are aware of
[08:29:41] <robertmaxrees> arup_r the backend should be your first priority.
[08:29:44] <arup_r> looks wise
[08:29:50] <shahin8r> well after the video is finished uploading i'm adding a post to a wordpress blog. and i don't want the post added until the video is done processing. so my approach is as of now: upload to api -> check status with settimeout -> when finished create post
[08:29:52] <arup_r> I am writing backend code
[08:30:07] <robertmaxrees> and looks are basically irrelevant - you can customize most plugins.  jquery validate is plenty standard.
[08:30:11] <shahin8r> so this approach must be best for me then robertmaxrees?
[08:30:17] <taplar> validations on front end are primarily for user experience.  validations on back end are for security
[08:30:26] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r that's the wrong way to do that fwiw.
[08:30:54] <jak2000> hi
[08:31:17] <jak2000> why cant get the text selected: $("#xcombctipemp2 option:selected").val();    i want the text not the value?
[08:31:19] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: oh, which approach should i take
[08:31:26] <taplar> jak2000: try text()
[08:31:57] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r your server should track status and create the post.
[08:32:09] <robertmaxrees> shahin8r since the window can be closed/crash/whatever before things are done.
[08:32:54] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: you're right. server side it is
[08:32:55] <jak2000> taplar thanks (done!(
[08:33:25] <shahin8r> robertmaxrees: thanks alot
[08:33:56] <robertmaxrees> sure
[08:41:51] <webzen> hi
[08:42:38] <webzen> I am using es6 modules and I used to use php to pass a value to my JS that became a global var I could use anywhere.  Now I have es6 bundles out of global scope, so how do i 'initialize' this variable out of the global scope and in the bundle.  I thought to make an sync ajax call but am told it's deprecated.
[08:43:58] <arup_r> the demo page is broken
[08:44:07] <arup_r> so I can't see how it works http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/Credit-Card-Validator-Plugin-with-jQuery.html
[08:44:16] <arup_r> Need to find alternatives
[08:44:18] <robertmaxrees> webzen huh?
[08:44:50] <robertmaxrees> webzen are you just trying to put a var in the global scope?
[08:44:58] <webzen> not any more
[08:45:04] <robertmaxrees> then what are you trying to do?
[08:45:11] <webzen> i have a php function that returns what 'group' you are in when logged in
[08:45:13] <webzen> ok ?
[08:45:24] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to pass a variable somewhere - where?
[08:45:36] <webzen> in JS i need to know that info, so in the past i passed it to js from php on page load
[08:45:57] <webzen> but now http://laravel.io/bin/32Rem
[08:46:13] <webzen> i make an ajax sync call to get the info but i'm told sync is deprecated
[08:46:15] <robertmaxrees> use deferreds instead.
[08:46:22] <robertmaxrees> or use callbacks.
[08:46:30] <robertmaxrees> instead of locking the browser.
[08:46:41] <webzen> um yeah, i dont know how to do that
[08:46:50] <webzen> sec, i'll make an example
[08:47:07] <robertmaxrees> var myNewDeferred = $.ajax(); myNewDeferred.done()
[08:47:13] <robertmaxrees> etc
[08:49:00] <webzen> line 14 is called from multiple places in my code and i need it to return the value in line 9 http://laravel.io/bin/d9wkY
[08:51:12] <webzen> down 2 pennies, up 1 we'll make it up in volume
[08:51:14] <webzen> oops
[08:53:15] <robertmaxrees> yeahg, not the right way to do that.
[08:54:21] <webzen> is there something easy you can show ?
[08:54:27] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to run fnliGroupName more than once?
[08:54:34] <robertmaxrees> or can it just be a single time?
[08:54:48] <webzen> single is fine
[08:54:54] <webzen> once they login it does not change
[08:56:10] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/51835a4fb50c
[08:56:11] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[08:57:17] <webzen> where would that go in this context ? http://laravel.io/bin/d9wkY#
[08:57:28] <robertmaxrees> it replaces that.
[08:57:29] <webzen> i call line 14 multiple times
[08:57:44] <webzen> you eliminated ajxPopulateEmp function
[08:57:52] <robertmaxrees> right, you don't use that any more.  you use groupName.done()
[08:58:01] <robertmaxrees> instead of line 14 in yours.
[08:58:04] <webzen> i need to keep that function
[08:58:07] <robertmaxrees> why?
[08:58:11] <webzen> it has 500 other lines in it
[08:58:16] <robertmaxrees> what does it do?
[08:58:27] <webzen> it populates a form on a page
[08:58:27] <robertmaxrees> you basically need to invert your logic.
[08:58:33] <robertmaxrees> that .done() needs to control all of that now.
[08:58:44] <robertmaxrees> because otherwise the data won't exist.
[08:58:45] <webzen> so whenever i need to populate the form, i call it
[08:59:04] <webzen> can you paste a new version of this ? http://laravel.io/bin/d9wkY#
[08:59:12] <webzen> keeping the function ?
[08:59:15] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[08:59:19] <robertmaxrees> can you flesh out the example more?
[09:00:33] <webzen> a call to ajxPopulateEmp() simply needs to run the code in the function and somehow, get the liGroupName
[09:00:57] <robertmaxrees> then put the .done() call in there...
[09:01:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why ypou're confused.
[09:01:48] <webzen> ok, i'm going to a meeting but when back i'll read on promises so i have more of a clue,  thank you robertmaxrees
[09:02:31] <webzen> thanks very much
[09:33:20] <samssh> Is there a way to attach data to an event in a handler, so that the data is accessible to a handler further up the bubble chain?
[09:34:12] <samssh> ev.data just seems to get reset for each handler.
[09:34:15] <taplar> possibly, an event is an object so you could probably just .prop = value off of it
[09:34:23] <robertmaxrees> samssh what are you doing?
[09:34:34] <robertmaxrees> like, why are you trying to modify the event object?
[09:34:55] <samssh> X: I have a dropdown, which I want to close upon a click outside of it.
[09:35:26] <webzen> robertmaxrees: line 12 please http://laravel.io/bin/eDwyX
[09:35:31] <samssh> My solution was to handle a click inside, attach a flag to the event, and then handle a body click, check for the flag, and either collapse or not.
[09:35:33] <webzen> is that what you mean ?
[09:35:53] <robertmaxrees> samssh just just the event.target() and see if that is the container, or a child of the container.
[09:36:10] <robertmaxrees> webzen no.
[09:36:20] <webzen> and forget the async false
[09:36:21] <robertmaxrees> return q.responseText; is not what you want.
[09:36:29] <webzen> ahh
[09:36:39] <webzen> am i getting warm ? :-)
[09:36:44] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:36:49] <robertmaxrees> you're not listening.
[09:37:18] * webzen is now listening very closely
[09:37:26] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/786b718c06a5
[09:37:28] <samssh> robertmaxrees, That should work. But is there a way to attach data to the event for another handler?
[09:37:44] <robertmaxrees> samssh i'm not familiar with that, and i would certainly avoid doing that.
[09:40:39] <webzen> http://laravel.io/bin/Mkr2j
[09:41:18] <robertmaxrees> webzen iirc you can't export a var, can you?
[09:41:26] <robertmaxrees> it's been a while.
[09:41:29] <webzen> yeah you can
[09:41:33] <webzen> in es6
[09:41:40] <robertmaxrees> then i dunno why that's erroring.
[09:42:12] <robertmaxrees> what line is it erroring on?
[09:42:17] <webzen> and these are all in the same js file so it's available anyways
[09:42:32] <webzen> but it's a var and can you do .done to a var ?
[09:42:45] <robertmaxrees> it's the deferred of the ajax call.
[09:42:51] <robertmaxrees> that's how deferreds work.
[09:43:12] <robertmaxrees> that's just like doing $.ajax().done();
[09:43:41] <webzen> ok it think the error is elsewhere,  thanks robertmaxrees very much. i'll go find the error
[09:49:00] <webzen> robertmaxrees: that fixed it, you are so helpful, thanks again
[09:49:07] <robertmaxrees> deffo!
[09:49:08] <webzen> now i need to read more about promises
[09:49:10] <robertmaxrees> glad i could help :)
[09:49:32] <webzen> i keep thinking, oh i don't need to learn about that yet but I DO !
[09:49:42] <taplar> cool, es6 arrows seem to be adding more of a groovy closure flavor to js
[09:50:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:50:25] <webzen> robertmaxrees: this is how i ended up http://laravel.io/bin/REn4Y
[09:50:51] <taplar> nums.forEach(v => { ... });
[09:51:26] <robertmaxrees> taplar except js already has closure, so i'm confused about why you're saying it's bring "more" of that....
[09:51:48] <taplar> just the whole arrow thing vs having to type out function
[09:52:00] <robertmaxrees> taplar that does more than replace anon functions.
[09:52:35] <robertmaxrees> it changes your context - your 'this' is now something different.
[09:52:47] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer not using anonymous functions as much as reasonable.
[09:54:34] <Scriptonaut> I have some weird behavior. I am binding a click on '.checkbox.fancy input[type=checkbox]', however, when I click just one of the checkboxes, the function I pass it is being called once for every match on the page
[09:54:51] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut show us what you've got.
[09:56:07] <Scriptonaut> ok one sec checking with a coworker, might be unrelated issue (turbolinks)
[09:59:52] <Scriptonaut> Ah, I had to first do $(document).off('click', '.checkbox.fancy input[type=checkbox]')
[10:00:01] <Scriptonaut> before binding, nevermind
[10:00:53] <taplar> so your binding multiple times
[10:01:03] <taplar> y?
[10:01:27] <robertmaxrees> err.
[10:01:32] <robertmaxrees> you're already using a delegated listener.
[10:01:35] <robertmaxrees> why are you re-binding it?
[10:01:49] <taplar> oh, lol
[10:02:11] <taplar> so the one event was hitting multiple delegate bindings, lol
[11:22:58] <jakarta2000> i'm reading up on js memory leaks and temporary objects. will this cause a temp obj leak?
[11:22:58] <jakarta2000> var a,b; a = $('<div>'); b = $('<div>'); a.append(b); $('body').append(a)
[11:23:17] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[11:24:39] <jakarta2000> would that have anything to do with jq being clever and using fragments?
[11:25:19] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[11:25:44] <robertmaxrees> it uses fragments under the hood when you call $() and pass in a string of markup.
[12:50:46] <Christofosho> Hi there. I was wondering if anyone could point me toward the method used to provide a "timeout" to a keydown event, so that a user can only press it once every X amount of time?
[12:53:46] <taplar> Christofosho: what have you tried?
[12:54:00] <Christofosho> taplar .delay did not work very well ;)
[12:54:19] <Christofosho> I thought about using setTimeout, but it's a bit complicated if there is a built-in jQuery workaround..
[12:54:39] <taplar> setTimeout delays execution, don't really stop execution
[12:54:46] <taplar> don't = doesn't
[12:55:02] <NoiseEee> Christofosho: check out http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[12:56:46] <Christofosho> NoiseEee this may be what I am looking for. And taplar thank you for that info. Very useful to know. Would that mean if a user held down a key, it would queue up a lot of executions?
[12:57:27] <NoiseEee> you get to say 'on this condition, only let it execute the callback function every X seconds
[12:57:33] <taplar> no, keydown only fires once on first down
[12:57:42] <taplar> keypress would fire repeatedly
[12:58:07] <Christofosho> taplar I use keydown in my game, and it fires repeatedly when held down :o
[12:58:17] <taplar> hmm
[13:00:05] <taplar> well son of a, wth...
[13:00:44] <taplar> so yeah
[13:01:05] <taplar> if you did set timeout on a keydown depending on how you did it would have multiple timeouts going
[13:02:26] <Christofosho> interesting. but I guess that's off topic for the jQuery channel. This throttle plugin works quite well, though! :)
[13:06:58] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/5k8c9aue/ <--- just playing around
[13:08:36] <taplar> i'm out, later all
[13:38:07] <socialblogsite> can I search/replace all css links and remove the “screen” type so the printer uses the screen version? (and probably the @media queries too)
[13:54:05] <socialblogsite> can edit a @media rule inside a document.styleSheets ? ( I want to remove the “screen only and” part
[14:14:37] <taplar> more playing around while i was thinking about it: http://jsfiddle.net/z2xb82fo/
[14:14:38] <taplar> later
[14:59:08] <duckxx_> so i have a toggle(true) set, but it only updates the element with display: block; ......... how do i update it with display: flex ?
[14:59:15] <duckxx_> is that even possible ?
[15:24:58] <lyhr> I used this statement successfully $( "body" ).css( "padding-bottom", "250px" ); to change a style of the body tag but trying to change a style of another tag that has an id of topNavLogo is not working.  $( "#topNavLogo" ).css( "max-width", "76px" );  Any suggestions?
[15:27:57] <bastones> lyhr: Have you checked the Developer Tools in your browser to see if any errors come up? (Ctrl + Shift + I)
[15:28:22] <robertmaxrees> lyhr are you sure there's only one element with that ID?
[15:29:02] <lyhr> there is only one item with that id and no errors present
[15:29:13] <robertmaxrees> and it's a block level element?
[15:31:07] <lyhr> it is an img inside an <a> tag <a><img/></a>
[15:31:18] <robertmaxrees> inline.
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> so are <a> tags
[15:32:19] <lyhr> the img does have a style on it of display: block;
[15:32:26] <robertmaxrees> then something else is up.
[15:32:30] <robertmaxrees> hard to help when we can't see it.
[15:33:05] <lyhr> ok thought maybe there was an issue with the statement itself I will work on what else may be causing the problem
[15:33:47] <lyhr> TY
[15:54:14] <lyhr> robertmaxrees: it was a salesforce tag that was causing the problem. got it working
[15:54:28] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[15:58:31] <lyhr> if i have an eventlistener of window.addEventListener('resize',checkNav); and i want to call more than one function upon resize should i add another window.addEventListener('resize',whateverFN); statement or can i add another function to the first statement?
[15:58:52] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[15:59:01] <robertmaxrees> are the two things related?
[15:59:52] <lyhr> yes my func has an if else in it and i could just add another if in that func if that is better
[16:00:16] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid binding extra handlers personally.
[16:01:05] <lyhr> ok good to know i will put more code in the first function
[16:21:55] <drei> The html gets written every one second, therefore on page load it takes a second to load. Looking for a way to write it so that the html shows on page load without delay - https://jsfiddle.net/kkv55tce/
[16:25:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kkv55tce/1/
[16:31:46] <robertmaxrees> drei ^ that anwer your question?
[16:33:50] <drei> not sure what the answer might be robertmaxrees
[16:34:07] <robertmaxrees> drei ... i just showed you a working version...
[16:34:32] <robertmaxrees> use setTimeout and avoid setInterval and use a recursive function.
[16:35:09] <drei> is it the same fiddle url?
[16:35:21] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:35:23] <drei> as what I specified above?
[16:35:23] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kkv55tce/1/ this...
[16:35:57] <drei> thank you so much, you are a legend!
[16:40:21] <drei> stupid question for you robertmaxrees...but in our case what is the use of the resursive function?
[16:40:37] <drei> *recursive function
[16:40:43] <robertmaxrees> take a guess.
[16:41:23] <drei> it only applies the setTimeout after we have written the innerHTML?
[16:41:48] <robertmaxrees> the function writes the html, then calls setTimeout, which will run a function after x seconds.
[16:42:57] <drei> great :)
[16:46:04] <bePolite> robertmaxrees: hello
[16:46:09] <bePolite> Its been a while
[16:46:27] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[16:46:39] <bePolite> Great work you're doing here
[16:46:46] <robertmaxrees> thank you.
[16:46:53] <bePolite> Do you usually attend JS conferences?
[16:47:03] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:47:20] <robertmaxrees> i have a goal to this year but i need to find one that doesn't conflict with my schedule.
[17:12:22] <socialblogsite> I’m trying to set cssText and cssRule.media for stylesheet rules and nothing works. What am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/z6a0puev/
[17:12:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:12:49] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[17:12:57] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to define stylesheets using CSS?
[17:14:30] <socialblogsite> I”m trying to REPLACE all “screen” by “” so the printer uses those styles.
[17:15:07] <socialblogsite> so all the styles default to “all”
[17:15:56] <socialblogsite> robertmaxrees: I’m trying to set the screen styles for “all”, so the printer can use them*
[17:16:09] <robertmaxrees> i'm at work.
[17:16:15] <robertmaxrees> i've already read it - gimme a sec.
[17:18:22] <hummus> I'm trying to create an effect using jquery that is basically an 'infinite' scroll with a finite number of elements, where the last element simply gets prepended to the start as you scroll. But I am having a hard time with the implementation. Anyone seen a script accomplishing something like that?
[17:19:31] <robertmaxrees> socialblogsite so that's a really bad idea.
[17:19:35] <robertmaxrees> don't do that with javascript.
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> you really need to edit your CSS>
[17:19:49] <robertmaxrees> hummus show what you've got so far.
[17:21:30] <socialblogsite> I can’t edit ALL the css. There are plugins, rules insice @media screen and I can’t re-define them all for print.
[17:21:55] <robertmaxrees> this seems really strange to me - what's the actual problem here?
[17:22:10] <robertmaxrees> because JS certainly isn't the solution.
[17:23:09] <socialblogsite> robertmaxrees: we are talking about a website with thousands of pages, tens of plugins, css generated with SASS (which I can’t touhc) and I need the styles defined only for “screen", to apply for “all”.
[17:23:51] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're not really going to be able to do this with JS in the first place.
[17:24:08] <socialblogsite> consider inside each @media screen media query there are hundreds of rules which I can’t just “redefine”.
[17:24:11] <robertmaxrees> and even if you could, why would you want users to print every little detail of your page?
[17:25:50] <socialblogsite> robertmaxrees: that’s EXACTLY what I want. I want to print EXACTLY what is in the page (there are solutions for terminal html-to-pdf to “fake” the device type to “screen” and setup the “width” to something wide (like 1280px, not 692pt) so I get something similar, but I don’t know terminal/unix stuff)
[17:26:04] <robertmaxrees> is this for you?
[17:26:07] <socialblogsite> what is “on the screen”
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> and not your end-users?
[17:26:43] <socialblogsite> it doesn’t matter if I change it for a few hours. It’s only until I generate all PDFs. Then I’d remove the script.
[17:26:51] <robertmaxrees> use phantomjs.
[17:26:57] <robertmaxrees> because you can't do this with JS.
[17:27:12] <robertmaxrees> it'll save you a ton of headaches.
[17:27:43] <socialblogsite> online tutorials describe how to access the media for each cssRule object. Can’t I change them?
[17:28:01] <hummus> robertmaxrees: this isn't it exactly, but you get the idea. http://jsbin.com/hetanotijo/edit?html,js,output
[17:28:17] <hummus> it works but it's way too fast. Looking to slow the effect down without using timeTimeout
[17:28:26] <hummus> or something
[17:28:43] <socialblogsite> can you briefle describe “why” I can’t? I’ll google it so you don’t have to describe it in deep.
[17:29:17] <socialblogsite> briefly sumarize* wyh I can’t
[17:32:44] <robertmaxrees> you can't "unload" the styles.
[17:32:54] <robertmaxrees> so you're not changing anything in place.
[17:33:03] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you exporting your entire site as a bunch of PDF docs?
[17:33:24] <socialblogsite> hummus: was that jsbin for me?
[17:33:33] <robertmaxrees> it was for me.
[17:33:35] <hummus> No, max
[17:33:40] <robertmaxrees> *robert ;)
[17:33:47] <socialblogsite> oh ok.
[17:34:01] <socialblogsite> I’m exporting it because the client asked for it.
[17:34:15] <socialblogsite> but he doesn’t like the “print” view.
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[17:34:29] <socialblogsite> isn’t that a reason good enough?
[17:34:33] <socialblogsite> hehe
[17:34:40] <robertmaxrees> i would have told them no.
[17:35:05] <robertmaxrees> that's a patently bizarre and unreasonable request imo.
[17:35:09] <socialblogsite> next issue. I don’t want to “unload”. I want to change the “media” for the existing rules from “screen” to “all”.
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> you cannot "change" it.
[17:35:23] <socialblogsite> ok
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> this is not a solution for JS.
[17:35:32] <robertmaxrees> you need to use phantomJS or something else.
[17:35:46] <socialblogsite> can I batch DUPLICATE THEM with the media “print”?
[17:35:55] <robertmaxrees> that's a very bad idea.
[17:36:08] <robertmaxrees> you're not going to get the solution you want./
[17:36:10] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[17:36:12] <socialblogsite> it HAS to be with a batch solution. I can’t edit tens of CSS reading “screen”.
[17:36:19] <robertmaxrees> then use phantomjs
[17:36:35] <robertmaxrees> or a browser plugin that converts things to pdf.
[17:36:51] <socialblogsite> will that change the DOM? the printer MUST see the modified content. Not just the screen.
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> phantomjs is not printing./
[17:37:06] <arc_> phantomjs sounds like exactly what you want and he suggested it like 10 minutes ago so maybe you should read about it
[17:37:14] <robertmaxrees> it's a headless browser that'll let you export to PDF.
[17:37:20] <socialblogsite> all the browser plugins use some online service… which use the “print” style
[17:37:28] <socialblogsite> I contacted some, none have replied.
[17:37:30] <robertmaxrees> doing what you want via javascript is going to not give you the results that you want.
[17:38:01] <socialblogsite> (it seems there are several websites taking money from people and using the same free services, which have stopped the services because of the abuse… so none of them work)
[17:38:10] <robertmaxrees> then use phantom.
[17:38:16] <socialblogsite> thank.s
[17:38:19] <socialblogsite> I’ll read about it.
[17:43:23] <socialblogsite> robertmaxrees: oh, NICE! that’s what I was looking for… but I was trying to add the script TO THE WEBSITE so wherever I read the page from, (server-side html-to-PDF service) the right css is served (some services run javascript), but phantom.js seems to be needed in the BROWSER, which I don’t have access to.
[17:44:02] <socialblogsite> can I automate that in my Chrome to batch read a list of URLS? (what the service was going to batch for me)
[17:44:23] <robertmaxrees> not via chrome
[17:44:34] <socialblogsite> (actually those services were in charge of setting a browser’s width and faking the “screen” media, but none of those have replied yet :(
[17:44:35] <robertmaxrees> should be a quick and simple script on your computer though.
[17:44:48] <robertmaxrees> phantom runs standalone.
[17:44:52] <robertmaxrees> not with the browser.
[17:45:17] <socialblogsite> “a script in my copmputer” means “linux” or some other command-line implementation?
[17:45:22] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:45:24] <robertmaxrees> not linux.
[17:45:28] <robertmaxrees> any OS can run phantom.
[17:45:52] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to write code.
[17:45:53] <socialblogsite> “any OS can run phantom” if I know what programming languaje?
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> any.
[17:46:13] <robertmaxrees> you just need to be able to call the executable and pass some arguments.
[17:46:24] <robertmaxrees> you could use node.js to do it.
[17:46:58] <socialblogsite> I also got command line html-to-PDF scripts, but I don’t even know how to install composer, and all that server stuff. I know JS and php WITHOUT server side setup of PHP
[17:47:02] <robertmaxrees> that
[17:47:15] <robertmaxrees> *this is all basically via command line.
[17:47:22] <robertmaxrees> and that's what you'll want to learn to do.
[17:47:25] <robertmaxrees> it's not at all difficult.
[17:47:42] <socialblogsite> robertmaxress: how would you charge to run it on your side? :)
[17:47:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:48:00] <robertmaxrees> if you're looking for somebody to do this for you, this channel isn't the right place.
[17:48:09] <socialblogsite> I have to pay someone, and the html-to-PDF services have not answered yet.
[17:48:16] <socialblogsite> I WASN’T.
[17:48:19] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to go to a place about freelancing.  there's also #Node.js if you'd like help getting it running.
[17:48:27] <socialblogsite> but since you said it’s “easy” without knowing my skills…
[17:48:58] <robertmaxrees> you want to feed a series of URLs to phantom.js and have it render pdfs.  that's a pretty easy thing to do.
[17:49:05] <robertmaxrees> i'm sorry if you're not familiar with how to do so.
[17:49:12] <socialblogsite> ok, your comment about “this is all command line…” goes against my skills I detailed above: “no command line skills".
[17:49:29] <robertmaxrees> then learn how.
[17:49:31] <socialblogsite> it’s ok. I wish you had read it before so I didn’t get so exited.
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> or pay somebody.
[17:49:37] <robertmaxrees> i did read it.
[17:49:44] <robertmaxrees> and given all of your constraints, that's your option.
[17:49:46] <socialblogsite> and you still suggested it?
[17:49:49] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:49:54] <socialblogsite> thanks for your time.
[17:49:58] <robertmaxrees> sure!
[17:55:08] <socialblogsite> robertMaxrees: I’m already able to iterate through css stylesheet rules that contain “screen” in them. Would duplicating those with “print” media type cause the same headaches you mentione?
[17:55:25] <robertmaxrees> doing this client-side with javascript will not give you the results you want.
[17:56:58] <socialblogsite> robertmarxrees: you are right! so I could use PHP to read all the css registered by wordpress, and replace the LINK tag before it renders! :)
[17:57:07] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:57:10] <robertmaxrees> do something server-side.
[17:57:20] <robertmaxrees> or do what i originally suggested.
[17:57:22] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[17:57:48] <socialblogsite> would you mind sumarizing why the printer won’t take those changes?
[17:57:54] <robertmaxrees> i already did.
[17:58:07] <socialblogsite> oh, let me go back. thaks.
[17:58:35] <socialblogsite> other than “is going to not give you the results that you want”?
[17:58:42] <socialblogsite> searching…
[17:59:58] <socialblogsite> ok, you said “you cannot "change" it.” but I can “delete” them, and “add” another with the new media. right?
[18:00:13] <socialblogsite> batch remove-add
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's slow and inefficient and may or may not render the same way.
[18:00:40] <robertmaxrees> so do something server-side.
[18:01:05] <socialblogsite> I don’t think it’s gonna be slower than editing tens of CSS and PHP plugins to find where they are all defined.
[18:01:30] <socialblogsite> we are talking of this script bothering the website a few hours until I’m done.
[18:01:33] <socialblogsite> not forever.
[18:01:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what to tell you at this point.
[18:01:56] <robertmaxrees> i've tried to explain why it's a bad idea, i've given you great alternatives, and i continue to reiterate those points.
[18:02:01] <robertmaxrees> so do whatever you want.
[18:02:02] <socialblogsite> “slow and inneficient” you are talking about milli, right?
[18:02:06] <socialblogsite> milliseconds*
[18:02:11] <robertmaxrees> again, it may not render the same way.
[18:02:40] <socialblogsite> i understand. precedence of css rules.
[18:02:42] <socialblogsite> got it.
[18:02:43] <socialblogsite> thanks :)
[18:03:04] <new_developer> <script type="application/javascript;version=1.8" src=https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script> won't load jQuery - is this normal?
[18:03:19] <robertmaxrees> new_developer you're missing an opening quote.
[18:03:24] <new_developer> (it fails even if I don't make a typo leaving off one of the " marks)
[18:03:54] <snover> invalid script types are ignored
[18:04:01] <snover> only firefox has a “javascript 1.8”
[18:04:11] <snover> new_developer: ^
[18:04:21] <robertmaxrees> socialblogsite that's not the only problem.  you're going to try to duplicate massive blobs of text, to replace in them (which will be slow), try to inject them in the same order, and that's not even accounting for files that include other files.
[18:04:27] <new_developer> snover: ah - so how do I tell Chrome I want JS 1.8 features?
[18:04:37] <dismist> chrome know dis
[18:04:41] <snover> you can’t because javascript 1.8 is proprietary
[18:05:47] <socialblogsite> I understand. Yes, I was going to do it one by one, so the order remains. would removing a rule in a stylesheet change the following items to be processed in a while statement? or would the original list remain until the whole while ends?
[18:06:38] <socialblogsite> i’m worried that removing one rule would shorten the list and skip the next element to be processed.
[18:06:52] <robertmaxrees> please take it to ##javascript or elsewhere at this point.
[18:06:55] <socialblogsite> (yes, I know. basic programming quesiton, but again, i’m not an expert)
[18:07:04] <socialblogsite> ohhhh
[18:07:06] <socialblogsite> i’m not?
[18:07:08] <socialblogsite> sory
[18:07:16] <socialblogsite> thanks :)
[18:08:00] <new_developer> odd - I thought Chrome would have better support for new versions of JS.
[18:08:03] <new_developer> thanks, snover
[18:08:12] <robertmaxrees> new_developer huh?  it supports lots of es6 features.
[18:08:25] <snover> javascript and ecmascript aren’t the same thing robertmaxrees
[18:08:29] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: I don't know ES6
[18:08:34] <new_developer> I know JavaScript.
[18:08:35] <robertmaxrees> snover i'm familiar.
[18:08:40] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:08:47] <snover> YAY NETSCAPEGG
[18:08:52] <snover> golf clap
[18:09:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw javascript is an ecmascript implementation.
[18:09:15] <snover> at least we have moved from being confused about the “java” part to being confused about the “script” part :)
[18:09:25] <snover> progress!!!
[18:09:32] <robertmaxrees> and chrome supports a lot of newer es6 features.
[18:09:41] <robertmaxrees> so yes, new_developer, you know ecmascript.
[18:10:02] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: but JS 1.8 supports very specific things, not all of which are in ECMAScript, as I have been told (perhaps that information is wrong?)
[18:10:33] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused about what JS 1.8 IS.
[18:11:04] <snover> js 1.8 does have features that aren’t in the ecmascript specification
[18:11:16] <snover> jscript has features that aren’t in the ecmascript specification too
[18:11:22] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: Well, I specifically was looking for let expressions, which were in JS 1.8 but not in ECMAScript.
[18:11:23] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:11:27] <robertmaxrees> welcome to be excessively pedantic.
[18:11:36] <robertmaxrees> yes, they are.
[18:11:37] <snover> welcome to THE INTERNET robertmaxrees
[18:11:39] <new_developer> again, as I have been told
[18:11:40] <robertmaxrees> ES6 introduced them.
[18:11:41] <snover> someone is wrong!
[18:11:45] <snover> :)
[18:11:51] <new_developer> but I'm not really sure what is/n't in ECMAScript
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features
[18:12:27] <robertmaxrees> again
[18:12:48] <robertmaxrees> javascript is an implementation of ecmascript.  not all implementations have the same features, but that's getting better and better.
[18:12:56] <robertmaxrees> the core language spec is relatively consistent between browsers.
[18:13:13] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: But that page reaffirms what I was told - ES6 has let BLOCKS, but no sign of let EXPRESSIONS.
[18:13:16] <new_developer> no?
[18:13:38] <snover> what do you think is the difference between those two things?
[18:14:17] <new_developer> snover: whether the variable is block scoped or expression scoped
[18:14:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:14:38] <new_developer> so if I want something scoped to the expression, there's an ES6 way to do that?
[18:14:43] <dismist> this boy read his books
[18:14:49] <robertmaxrees> fwi - http://i.imgur.com/yC7w9AQ.png
[18:14:58] <robertmaxrees> expressions were dropped in 1.7
[18:15:09] <dismist> thats what i said
[18:15:10] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't go by those pages on MDN fwiw.
[18:15:27] <dismist> i avoid mdn support docs at all costs
[18:15:32] <robertmaxrees> uh
[18:15:38] <robertmaxrees> you should use them actually, but https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript#JavaScript_versions
[18:15:50] <robertmaxrees> "The explicit versioning and opt-in of language features was Mozilla-specific and is in process of being removed. Firefox 4 was the last version which referred to an JavaScript version (1.8.5). With new ECMA standards, JavaScript language features are now often mentioned with their initial definition in ECMA-262 Editions such as Edition 6 (ES6)."
[18:15:54] <dismist> its just how they are presented/written dating back to the windows help docs
[18:16:04] <snover> wow, TIL someone actually did…that
[18:16:06] <dismist> then again i dont fuck with this ecma nonsense
[18:16:23] <new_developer> "The let statement requires the JavaScript version 1.7 (or higher) opt-in" - this is what I am trying to do
[18:16:23] <robertmaxrees> they're also some of the most accurate and well maintained.
[18:16:25] <dismist> sounds like youre trying to do traditional server side programming on the front end
[18:16:35] <robertmaxrees> new_developer re-read the paragraph i JUST pasted.
[18:16:48] <dismist> theyve made a huge SEO push to get to the top of the rankings with stackoverflow and w3schools (also not a fan)
[18:18:11] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: I've re-read it like 6 times now. The only thing I can think of that you might want me to focus on is that it "is in the process of being removed," but that's next month new_developer's problem.
[18:18:21] <robertmaxrees> new_developer except it's not.
[18:18:26] <robertmaxrees> FF4 was the last one to support it.
[18:18:31] <new_developer> That's false
[18:18:32] <robertmaxrees> no other browser supports that concept.
[18:18:35] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[18:18:45] <robertmaxrees> deprecation notice doesn't mean it was removed, it means you really shouldn't use it.
[18:18:48] <new_developer> I can confirm that FF 39 is supporting it right now
[18:18:59] <robertmaxrees> furthermore, this was specific to a single vendor.
[18:19:07] <robertmaxrees> so i would really suggest not using it.
[18:19:45] <new_developer> Which I understood from snover a while ago - thanks for clarifying it
[18:20:09] <new_developer> still disappointed that I don't have any option in Chrome to enable experimental things
[18:20:17] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[18:20:17] <dismist> crybaby
[18:20:21] <new_developer> dismist: ha
[18:20:22] <robertmaxrees> it's not "experimental"
[18:20:29] <robertmaxrees> it was specific to FF from a few years ago.
[18:21:11] <dismist> have you new school developers abandoned ie/opera/safari all togetheR?
[18:21:17] <robertmaxrees> dismist we can't.
[18:21:22] <new_developer> dismist: I have
[18:21:23] <robertmaxrees> we support IE and Safari.
[18:21:33] <dismist> was askin new developer
[18:21:39] <new_developer> I don't have to worry about them
[18:21:52] <robertmaxrees> and new_developer fwiw chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony
[18:21:53] <dismist> he sounds like one of these kids who went to school for web dev or something and has not learned the true foundations
[18:22:08] <new_developer> dismist: I have not been to school for anything yet
[18:22:12] <new_developer> 100% self taught
[18:22:18] <robertmaxrees> same here ;)
[18:22:28] <dismist> do you remember the days where designs were entirely table based, then the big css/div's movement?
[18:22:36] <robertmaxrees> yep
[18:22:52] <dismist> how about this... geocities and the animated email box icons / animated flaming horizontal rules
[18:22:59] <robertmaxrees> yep
[18:23:10] <robertmaxrees> and transparent 1px spacer gifs
[18:23:29] <dismist> all over the f'n place
[18:23:51] <dismist> i still have to code html emails like that
[18:24:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:24:14] <robertmaxrees> the only reliable way these days.
[18:24:19] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: Thanks - helpful to know I can enable it on my own computer, but is there no way to signal to the browser "Please enable this option on the user's behalf when they browse my site?"
[18:24:26] <new_developer> That's what I was looking for in the versioning of the JS
[18:24:31] <robertmaxrees> new_developer again
[18:24:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how to phrase this any differently.
[18:24:41] <dismist> its funny we target mobile so hard when the phones are only getting better and faster and bigger
[18:24:49] <dismist> to the point where targetting such small screeens will soon be obsolete
[18:24:52] <robertmaxrees> the concept of javascript 1.8 was a firefox-specific thing.  that is not a thing any more.
[18:24:57] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use javascript 1.8 in the wild.
[18:24:58] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: I got that
[18:25:03] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:25:14] <robertmaxrees> and no, you cannot change end user's flags in chrome.
[18:25:21] <dismist> haha
[18:25:26] <new_developer> robertmaxrees: I'm asking if there's an equivalent that I can do on the server side that would tell chrome to enable experimental JS
[18:25:27] <robertmaxrees> if you'd like to use ES6 features, look at babel.
[18:25:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:25:33] <robertmaxrees> there is not.
[18:25:42] <robertmaxrees> nor would you want to.
[18:25:47] <dismist> naw man but i bet there are things in that experiemental js u can do server side instead
[18:25:56] <new_developer> so I'll have to do feature sniffing and disable the site if their browser can't support whatever
[18:26:05] <robertmaxrees> use babel.
[18:26:15] <robertmaxrees> transpile to ES5, everybody wins.
[18:26:47] <robertmaxrees> just about every browser you care about will support 5.
[18:27:18] <new_developer> so with bable, I can write whatever version I want and send the JS and the bable code to the browser, and it will transpile it for me before executing?
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:27:39] <new_developer> hm - I'm trying to avoid having any kind of server side at all
[18:27:40] <robertmaxrees> babel will let you write ES6 and will transpile that to ES5.
[18:28:08] <robertmaxrees> https://babeljs.io/docs/setup/
[18:28:12] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you're SOL.
[18:28:58] <new_developer> https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/browser/ seems to indicate I can do that
[18:29:06] <robertmaxrees> "Not intended for serious use"
[18:29:16] <new_developer> that's OK
[18:29:18] <robertmaxrees> just because you can do something doesn't mean it's a good idea.
[18:29:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[18:29:44] <new_developer> demos for a job portfolio
[18:29:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:30:00] <robertmaxrees> they're going to care about those kinds of things.
[18:30:23] <new_developer> I alerady have all the boring crap. I'm trying to do something weird to catch people's attention.
[18:30:33] <new_developer> everyone has the same boring profile stuff
[18:30:41] <new_developer> I want to add one additional thing that's really out there
[18:30:43] <robertmaxrees> and you transpile before uploading btw.
[18:31:20] <robertmaxrees> so there's no real "server-side" to worry about.
[18:31:29] <robertmaxrees> build an interesting feature though.
[18:31:51] <robertmaxrees> i've tried to do cute code stuff to grab attention and it wound up making me look kind of weird.
[18:31:57] <new_developer> anyway, it's clear that JS 1.8 isn't going to be the thing, so I'll have to go figure something else out. Thanks for the thoughts, robertmaxrees
[18:32:09] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[18:32:42] <TML> is there a reason to prefer $(document).ready(...) vs $(...)?
[18:32:59] <TML> the docs seem to imply they're the same thing, but are silent on tradeoffs
[18:33:12] <TML> and yet all the examples seem to be in $(document).ready
[18:33:52] <TML> $(...) tickles my lisp-brain more, but I want to make sure I'm not doing something stupid
[18:35:53] <powersurge> it seems that mobile safari is not executing my document ready when the user navigates away and revisits the page via back button
[18:35:58] <powersurge> any suggestions/workarounds?
[18:36:06] <powersurge> I've found some solutions but all of them seem to be outdated
[18:40:54] <shoky> TML: they do the same thing, no reason to use one over the other except that $(document).ready(...)  is clearer
[18:41:11] <TML> shoky: Thanks
[19:08:46] <docmur> I have a bunch of SQL data to display to the user from my web system, does any one have recommendations, beyond simple tables, for displaying the data in a sleek, stylish fashion, hopefully with built in search functionality.  I already have all the backend done in PHP
[19:11:40] <mdev> yes
[19:11:52] <mdev> head and shoulders the best table plugin i've seen is datatables
[19:12:06] <mdev> it's jquery based and is incredibly powerful+feature rich
[19:12:20] <mdev> https://www.datatables.net/
[19:13:53] <docmur> looks good :-)
[19:13:56] <docmur> Thanks
[19:21:53] <compact> http://pastebin.com/waPsz7Ya
[19:22:04] <compact> any idea why when i change the 'dispatch-date"
[19:22:08] <compact> it actions like 3-4 times

[22:58:13] <drei> glyphicons
[22:58:27] <drei> up and down arrows not working
[22:59:00] <Jacta> drei works fine here
[23:00:25] <Jacta> drei, oh now I see, start with setting the "closed" arrow to them all and then set "open" to the selected instead
[23:17:50] <hellyeah> morning
[23:17:59] <howardg> good day. The ajax callback function always has the signature of always(function( data|jqXHR, textStatus, jqXHR|errorThrown ) { });
[23:17:59] <howardg> but which one exactly is jqxhr?
[23:19:01] <howardg> is there a consistent way to get jqxhr no matter the response is success or failure?
[23:19:17] <bePolite> walabe: There?
[23:19:27] <bePolite> you got a lot of issues with your fiddle
[23:19:29] <bePolite> This works http://jsfiddle.net/bePolite/vqsgkn7e/14/
[23:20:03] <walabe> Thanks!!! sorry i forgot to say that i realised i was using "." instead of "#"
[23:47:59] <hellyeah> anyone around :D
