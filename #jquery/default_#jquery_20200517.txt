[03:53:34] <inthl> besides doing polling with timeouts, is there some method to e.g. display something on a webpage when a user has done something somewhere else - for example, confirm a dialogue on his phone which triggers an event on the webserver? how could one detect on the webpage that a state changed on the webserver?
[03:55:16] <inthl> or is really polling with timeouts the only option? I do see such things frequently, mostly used with 2-step verification, where a user confirmed something on his phone, changing the contents of a website in the browser on another computer immediately

[04:45:54] <Jaseinatl> what do you pass to off when passing an object to on?
[04:46:28] <Jaseinatl> I tried namespacing events by adding a .something to each event and that didn't work.
