[02:59:06] <km4> hi
[03:11:54] <sisaruos> I have a webpage which loads third-party website inside an IFrame. This website has a File Download link. Is there a way to use jQuery to detect from my webpage, when a user has completed downloading that file ?
[03:20:22] <hellyeah> morning
[04:17:34] <Vipii> Hi everyone, anyone know if it is possible to display an external navigation ( On other site ) on my website?
[04:24:13] <Cork> Vipii: not sure what you mean by that
[04:26:45] <Vipii> Cork: We have 2 different websites online. One is our main business website in Drupal, other one is our blog in Wordpress. Now my question is, is it possible if I edit the navigation on our Drupal site, it also automaticly changes on the Wordpress site? I was thinking about a Fixed iFrame but iFrames are to unsecure
[04:27:33] <Cork> Vipii: it might very well be possible, but it would be a server side question (drupal/wordpress) not something you can handle in js
[04:39:22] <lenswipee> hi, is it possible to turn modal on to specific parts of HTML?
[04:39:44] <Cork> as in only covering a part of the pagE?
[04:41:02] <lenswipee> Cork: hi bro. yes. say <html><body><div id="modal"></div>...
[04:41:16] <Cork> lenswipee: look at containment
[04:42:08] <lenswipee> Cork: without having to go jquery dialog route as it's not a popout thing.
[04:42:31] <lenswipee> Cork: jquery containment?
[04:42:48] <Cork> wait
[04:42:58] <Cork> by modal you didn't mean jquery dialog?
[04:43:06] <Cork> then what do you mean?
[04:43:42] <lenswipee> Cork: when you block out the background and focus on something.
[04:43:52] <Cork> uh
[04:44:04] <Cork> that isn't modal
[04:44:17] <lenswipee> Cork: yes i know jquery dialog modal ON does it
[04:44:31] <Cork> modal is a dialog you can't "go back" to the main program before you've answered
[04:44:48] <Cork> lenswipee: so what exactly are you looking for?
[04:44:58] <Cork> just a way to prevent someone from seeing part of the page?
[04:45:15] <lenswipee> Cork: I want that affect for part of a HTML page as I want user to complete certain details.
[04:45:29] <Cork> huh?
[04:45:34] <gju> like in boostraps modal dialogs?
[04:45:50] <Cork> he, want a modal dialog but not a modal dialog
[04:45:55] <Cork> not sure what part he wants though
[04:46:00] <lenswipee> Cork: It's a form I suppose but its not done as a dialog and dont want it to either
[04:46:23] <Cork> lenswipee: could you stop explaining what it isn't and explain what you want instead >_<'
[04:46:38] <Cork> so you have a form, is it overlaying the page or in content?
[04:46:45] <lenswipee> I want:
[04:47:18] <lenswipee> <html><body><div id="modal"><form></form></div>...
[04:47:54] <Cork> uh.. you know that line means absolutely nothing right?
[04:48:07] <Cork> all that says is "i want a form in a div with an id"
[04:48:41] <lenswipee> I want everything except the form blocked out
[04:48:58] <lenswipee> until user completes details of the form
[04:49:00] <Cork> ok, and the form is incontent?, overlay? what?
[04:49:18] <lenswipee> in content
[04:49:33] <Cork> ok, finally we're getting somewhere
[04:49:41] <lenswipee> :)
[04:50:45] <lenswipee> Surely there is some clever jquery that allow you to specify some selector you want modal ON for
[04:54:19] <lenswipee> OR can I just disable everything except the form?
[04:55:24] <gju> you can basically manipulate everything on your site using jquery.
[04:56:21] <Cork> lenswipee: a bit of a hack job, but something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/t7zhu0nr/
[04:57:59] <lenswipee> Cork: i'll go over it with a fine tooth comb
[04:58:20] <Cork> lenswipee: you might want to bind focus instead of keydown
[04:58:41] <Cork> basically what you need to do is capture tab switch focus as that can escape the cover if you don't
[04:59:31] <lenswipee> Cork: not sure why you got two forms
[04:59:46] <Cork> lenswipee: just to prove that the second form isn't accessable
[04:59:51] <Cork> btw fixed https://jsfiddle.net/t7zhu0nr/1/
[05:00:58] <lenswipee> running it in IE10...odd, what you running it in?
[05:01:26] <Cork> chrome and firefox
[05:01:39] <Cork> but should work find in any browser
[05:01:48] <Cork> the code is fairly simple
[05:02:06] <lenswipee> when i type in the field the second form still shows blocked
[05:03:28] <lenswipee> in your example the modal never turns off
[05:03:41] <lenswipee> how i know it's actually working?
[05:04:18] <Cork> lenswipee: uh, you shouldn't be able to type in the second form; ever
[05:04:32] <Cork> there are no code to remove the cover
[05:05:37] <lenswipee> Cork: i want the "blackout" to go away once all fields have data in it.
[05:06:05] <Cork> lenswipee: well then you would have to write code to do that :)
[05:06:16] <Cork> lenswipee: i just gave you how to do the cover part
[05:06:27] <Cork> the logic you should be able to add fairly easy
[05:06:57] <lenswipee> Cork: i must have missed the "cover" part. whatever that is. i'll look again.
[05:07:18] <Cork> lenswipee: the part where it prevents you from accessing the rest of the page
[05:08:09] <lenswipee> Cork: This might look ugly in live production?
[05:08:28] <Cork> lenswipee: how it looks is up to how you style it
[05:08:49] <Cork> lenswipee: but the underlying solution is the same as modal dialogs use
[05:09:00] <Cork> styling is up to you
[05:09:15] <Cork> (though note you can't use a completely transparent element as ie will ignore that)
[05:09:19] <lenswipee> Cork: If I have to style it myself then it's not a good idea.
[05:09:25] <Cork> O_o
[05:09:45] <Cork> sooo, you want a custom solution without designing it your self?
[05:09:50] <Cork> good luck with that...
[05:09:51] <lenswipee> Cork: I would like the consistency in style as the "blockout" in jquery dialog.
[05:10:11] <Cork> lenswipee: so grab the classes from the jquery ui css
[05:13:49] <lenswipee> doesn't sound right man
[05:13:55] <Cork> O_o
[05:14:04] <Cork> "doesn't sound right"?
[05:14:06] <Cork> what doesn't
[05:14:15] <Cork> it's just css, if you want to have the same look, just use it
[05:15:39] <lenswipee> as you said i sounds like a hack job.
[05:16:09] <Cork> the hack job is the written code, as i just smacked it together in less then 2 mins
[05:16:16] <lenswipee> if($(event.target).closest(target).length > 0) { return; } <-- what does this mean?
[05:16:33] <Cork> what do you think?
[05:16:51] <lenswipee> no idea.
[05:18:52] <lenswipee> I guess I'm not getting an explanation lol
[06:39:57] <gju> does jquery clear all handlers if i re-render a certain element?
[06:43:42] <zagaza-> does anyone know how I can use modernizr to disable :hover for mobiles?
[06:50:35] <hellyeah> hey
[06:50:47] <hellyeah> do you also suggest that site to learn jquery basics http://try.jquery.com/
[06:51:04] <hellyeah> my collegue will learn jquery
[07:04:06] <hellyeah> any comment
[07:04:08] <hellyeah> ?
[07:26:05] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:30:44] <nru> hi
[07:33:11] <nru> i have a question. I have 2 pages index.php xmltohtml.php, in index.php I have a div called OCI data which will be filled with input fields which will be generated in xmltohtml.php. I do a ajax call to this xmltohtml.php it generates the input fields and then i catch the data in my ajax and later on append it to my div with: $("#OCIData").append(data); . In my PHP I also decode characters, so if it puts item& in the value it must put it
[07:34:12] <Cork> nru: ever heard of linebreaks?
[07:34:30] <Cork> that line became so long it got cutoff
[07:34:39] <nru> :o
[07:34:44] <nru> which was the last part
[07:34:48] <nru> u got
[07:34:50] <Cork> also those become very hard to read
[07:34:52] <slax0r> it must put it
[07:35:07] <Cork> nru: start with asking the question instead
[07:35:11] <nru> it must put item& but now it puts item&amp; any idea?
[07:35:16] <Cork> what is it you need help with
[07:35:23] <nru> that was the last part
[07:35:38] <Cork> nru: php need to escape things
[07:35:42] <nru> in my input fields the & will be transformed to &amp;
[07:35:44] <Cork> just like for normal html
[07:35:51] <slax0r> Cork: he's appending an input field with jquery that he gets through an ajax call, and it's printing &amp; instead of &
[07:35:56] <slax0r> and he's decoding in PHP
[07:35:59] <nru> yes
[07:36:14] <Cork> he append html ya
[07:36:15] <nru> you are right slax0r
[07:36:20] <Cork> so the problem happen in php, not js
[07:36:27] <slax0r> Cork: think so, just saw a bit of this convo on ##php ^^
[07:36:31] <nru> if i check
[07:36:33] <nru> XHR
[07:36:37] <slax0r> apparently PHP returns correctly
[07:36:43] <nru> the response of the xmltohtml.php file returns correctly
[07:36:52] <slax0r> did you check the raw output?
[07:36:54] <Cork> nru: could you put the code you have in a jsfiddle?
[07:36:56] <nru> value="test1&test2">
[07:37:03] <nru> yes
[07:37:09] <Cork> nru: that isn't actually correct html
[07:37:13] <nru> yes i cut
[07:37:17] <Cork> & should always be escaped
[07:37:22] <nru> <div style="display:none;"><input type="hidden" name="NEW_ITEM-DESCRIPTION[1]" value="test1&test2">
[07:37:41] <nru> i will get code
[07:37:43] <Cork> so <input type="text" value="test1&amp;test2"> is the correct
[07:37:45] <Cork> + markup
[07:37:46] <nru> no
[07:37:57] <nru> if i check in my index.php where i receive the data and append
[07:37:59] <nru> then you see there
[07:38:04] <nru> <input type="text" value="test1&amp;test2">
[07:38:06] <Cork> nru: yes https://jsfiddle.net/q2sxs4jz/
[07:38:10] <nru> but it must be <input type="text" value="test1&test2">
[07:38:33] <Cork> & is an escape character in html
[07:38:39] <nru> the input fields are hidden
[07:38:48] <Cork> so the browser will try to see &test1 as an html entity
[07:38:56] <Cork> and error correct it to &amp;test1
[07:39:13] <Cork> nru: see the fiddle
[07:40:12] <nru> <span class="cm-string">"test1&amp;test2"</span>
[07:40:14] <nru> yes i see
[07:40:28] <Cork> and just to prove hidden doesn't matter https://jsfiddle.net/q2sxs4jz/1/
[07:40:35] <nru> the reason is i need to post <span class="cm-string">"test1&test2"</span> and not <span class="cm-string">"test1&amp;test2"</span>
[07:40:48] <Cork> uh
[07:40:50] <nru> because the receiving party gets an error receiving &amp;
[07:40:58] <Cork> you can't post a span...
[07:41:01] <nru> noooo
[07:41:06] <nru> this is a example from your fiddle
[07:41:08] <nru> in my case its
[07:41:17] <nru> <input type="hidden" name="NEW_ITEM-DESCRIPTION[1]" value="test1&amp;test2">
[07:41:22] <nru> this will be posted
[07:41:23] <Cork> nru: you have problems somehwere else
[07:41:31] <Cork> that is valid correct html
[07:41:37] <nru> but must be : <input type="hidden" name="NEW_ITEM-DESCRIPTION[1]" value="test1&test2">
[07:41:42] <Cork> and the result value is test1&test2
[07:41:45] <Cork> nru: you can't
[07:41:49] <Cork> cause that isn't valid html
[07:42:09] <nru> hmm
[07:42:14] <nru> they ask me to encode the data
[07:42:21] <Cork> nru: so the problem is something is grabbing the parsed html text
[07:42:32] <Cork> so you need to look at that part
[07:42:39] <nru> so after the post?
[07:42:44] <Cork> no
[07:42:53] <Cork> nru: you need to share the code that does this
[07:43:00] <nru> yes moment
[07:43:08] <Cork> nru: but the problem is: 1. php generates broken html
[07:43:13] <nru> i will cut only the relevant parts
[07:43:19] <Cork> test1&test2 SHOULD be test1&amp;test2
[07:43:27] <Cork> not test1&test2
[07:43:41] <Cork> 2. something is not working with dom text and grabs html entities
[07:43:42] <nru> yes but if it is going to be posted
[07:43:46] <slax0r> nru: I believe Cork is trying to tell you to not decode in PHP, but just let it print &amp; instead of &, is this correct?
[07:43:46] <nru> what do they receive as value
[07:43:55] <Cork> ya
[07:43:59] <Cork> that is part of the problem
[07:44:02] <nru> ye
[07:44:12] * hellyeah meeEeEee
[07:44:12] <nru> let me pastebin
[07:44:18] <Cork> something is encoding text to html entities
[07:44:25] <Cork> and no matter how broken the output from php is
[07:44:31] <Cork> you will get it as long as you encode the text
[07:45:45] <nru> http://pastebin.com/NekRDYdZ
[07:45:53] <nru> this is the part where the form is
[07:45:57] <nru> everything is cut and paste
[07:46:23] <Cork> uh...
[07:46:24] <nru> http://pastebin.com/eDPVVTRt
[07:46:29] <Cork> jsfiddle <--
[07:46:30] <nru> this is the part where the input fields are generated
[07:46:36] <Varun_Krishna> Hi guys, I have a doubt, is there a way to send the pasword data, securely to the post ($.ajax(...)) or is there any way hiding the password data in the browsers' console ?
[07:46:49] <Cork> and you need to post the generated html, not php code
[07:47:14] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: no, you can't hide the things from the user in the webpage
[07:47:33] <Cork> security happens between the browser and the server, not between javascript and the server
[07:47:50] <Cork> javascript runs AS the user
[07:48:16] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: but when making a post request in some banking application I mostly don't see any data in the network panel in the browser.
[07:48:56] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: in those cases it is cause they use external resource like java or flash
[07:49:08] <Cork> but all data the site sends the user can see
[07:49:22] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: I am making a post request to some api, with my user name and password , if I open the network panel the my password and user name is visible.
[07:49:23] <Cork> with the exception of eme
[07:49:25] * taplar wonders what password a site would use in the browser that the user didn't provide it with
[07:49:25] <nru> Cork i cant jsfiddle i use ajax for an append(data) and the input fields i get form a PHP file
[07:49:35] <nru> i dont see where the F* this goes wrong
[07:49:46] <Cork> nru: ya, but i can't parse your php code in my head
[07:49:49] <Cork> i need the generated html
[07:49:59] <nru> yes its this
[07:50:00] <nru> i paste
[07:50:00] <Cork> also i need the html you inject this into
[07:50:31] <nru> http://jsfiddle.net/ovc24cr3/
[07:50:34] <nru> this is generated is this ok ?
[07:51:15] <nru> brb 30 mins Cork
[07:53:34] <Cork> nru: works just fine here https://jsfiddle.net/ovc24cr3/1/
[07:53:41] <Cork> no &amp; in the output
[07:54:23] <taplar> value="'. html_entity_decode("test1&amp;test2") .'">';
[07:54:26] <taplar> ^
[07:54:37] <Cork> ya...
[07:54:43] <taplar> your decoding it
[07:54:48] <Cork> should have just been value="test1&amp;test2"
[07:55:12] <Cork> but that still doesn't explain why he gets test1&amp;test2 somewhere else
[07:55:28] <Cork> (not sure where that somewhere else is though)
[07:55:53] <taplar> unless that's coming from one of the other numerous variables he isn't encoding/decoding and taking at face value
[07:56:20] <Cork> nru: https://jsfiddle.net/ovc24cr3/2/
[07:56:24] <Cork> and an example with serialize()
[07:56:59] <gju> random question: does jquery clear all handlers if i re-render a certain element?
[07:57:17] <Cork> gju: rerender or replace?
[07:57:26] <Cork> (very different things)
[07:57:39] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: So there is no way to stop the values being passed to the post request ?
[07:57:49] <gju> i think i replace it.
[07:57:53] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: sure, but then you don't get it in the server either
[07:58:08] <gju> http://jsfiddle.net/vr8rvqaj/
[07:58:10] <Cork> gju: if you add new html, in a parent element for example
[07:58:14] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Can't get it . Ok
[07:58:15] <Cork> then yes you replace the old dom element
[07:58:25] <gju> alright. so that's the case here. thanks.
[07:58:30] <Cork> and all references to the old object is removed
[07:58:40] <Cork> (unless you keep reference to that specific dom element)
[07:58:46] <gju> i was just wondering why i have to add an handler over and over again.
[07:58:56] <taplar> you don't.  use a delegate
[07:58:59] <Cork> gju: use a delegated handler
[07:59:31] <gju> i'll google that.
[07:59:43] <hellyeah> hey
[07:59:46] <Cork> gju: https://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:59:54] <hellyeah> why i cannot drag button in y-axis http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/17/
[08:00:00] <nmaxcom> hi !
[08:00:38] <Cork> oooh... i'm going to start referencing this in stead
[08:00:41] <Cork> gju: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:01:03] <gju> found it already. ;)
[08:01:07] <hellyeah> anything here?
[08:01:15] <taplar> hmm, now i have less reason to finish my own page on delegation, :/
[08:01:30] <Cork> taplar: heh, ya
[08:01:39] <hellyeah> xD
[08:01:46] <Cork> delegation has been my biggest problem with the on function
[08:01:56] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: JQuery is awesome dude :)
[08:02:06] <Cork> it has always been a pain getting ppl to understand that on has two ways of working
[08:02:07] <hellyeah> i need help pls
[08:02:28] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: ya it is, but that is to quite a degree cause the language it is written in
[08:02:29] <gju> i think it's pretty intuitive.
[08:02:35] <gju> if you know it exists.
[08:02:45] <Varun_Krishna> he he he :0
[08:02:58] <Cork> gju: ya, api.jquery.com is a good read :)
[08:03:05] <Cork> except for delegation where it falls short
[08:03:23] <gju> does anybody here write coffeescript?
[08:03:32] <gju> (another random question)
[08:03:33] <Cork> gju: when i can't avoid it
[08:03:37] <taplar> hellyeah: you are able to drag on the y axis, but your parent div is super tiny
[08:03:43] <gju> it looks neat tbh.
[08:03:44] <Cork> gju: i hate the thing
[08:03:49] <gju> i like that condensed style of it
[08:03:55] <Cork> gju: it adds all the bad parts of ruby in js
[08:04:02] <Cork> like implicit returns
[08:04:28] <gju> it returns the last value
[08:04:31] <gju> afaik
[08:04:33] <Cork> so you have to explicitly always return something just to avoid breaking things cause a bad return value
[08:04:42] <Cork> gju: ya, that is implicit returns
[08:05:09] <Cork> gju: the problem is ex. $.each(function() { obj.option = true; }) works fine
[08:05:19] <Cork> gju: but $.each(function() { obj.option = false; }) breaks
[08:05:30] <Cork> gju: and you have to do $.each(function() { obj.option = false; true; })
[08:05:37] <taplar> heh
[08:05:38] <Cork> just cause of that stupid implicit return
[08:05:40] <gju> whut?
[08:05:43] <hellyeah> taplar: btw today i gave support to my collegue and that was really important. I really want to than you for all support you gave
[08:05:47] <Cork> ex6 solves this
[08:05:50] <Cork> *es6
[08:05:57] <hellyeah> $(fn) i didnt understand thid
[08:05:57] <taplar> another hand coming on board?
[08:05:58] <hellyeah> s
[08:06:15] <hellyeah> taplar: seems that way but he has own project
[08:06:27] <Cork> gju: ya, this bites us in rails here about 2-3 times a year
[08:06:31] <hellyeah> taplar: so i will do my project also i will help him to do his project
[08:06:36] <Cork> and it is a PAIN
[08:06:36] <hellyeah> how does it sound xD
[08:06:40] <taplar> cool
[08:06:47] <gju> weird. i never had that problem.
[08:06:49] <taplar> less of a bus factor it sounds like
[08:07:04] <Cork> gju: so ya, explicit return is a good thing
[08:07:06] <hellyeah> less of a bus factor can you explain this?
[08:07:16] <taplar> i could, but a goggle might be better
[08:07:32] <taplar> essentially the more people who understand a code base the better
[08:07:38] <Cork> gju: also i like the js syntax and that is the only reason for coffiescript
[08:07:51] <Cork> so no, i'm not a fan
[08:07:57] <taplar> if something happens to a single person who knows a code base, the company who has to manage that code base can be screwed
[08:08:17] <taplar> sickness, accidental death (ex. 'hit by a bus') etc.
[08:08:23] <taplar> thus, bus factor
[08:08:53] <taplar> usually associated also with the term 'knowledge silos'
[08:10:29] <taplar> heck, not event death
[08:10:35] <taplar> just one day that one guy quits
[08:10:51] <taplar> :)
[08:12:28] <hellyeah> taplar: i understand let me check
[08:12:43] <hellyeah> i understand metaphor here :XD
[08:13:31] <hellyeah> taplar: is it track factor or bus factor?
[08:13:39] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2164692/is-it-truck-factor-or-bus-factor
[08:13:40] <taplar> bus
[08:14:00] <hellyeah> those concepts got my attention
[08:14:02] <taplar> eh, could be either really
[08:14:25] <taplar> language is just a way to express thoughts, :)
[08:15:10] <hellyeah> well truck is powerful vehicle then bus
[08:15:39] <taplar> lol
[08:15:51] <hellyeah> i wanna be truck
[08:16:00] <hellyeah> my co-worker can be bus
[08:16:11] <hellyeah> nevermind me
[08:16:13] <hellyeah> xD
[08:16:14] <taplar> no, lol, no no, both kill you.  you don't want either, lol
[08:16:26] <taplar> atleast in the saying
[08:16:27] <hellyeah> i become truck
[08:16:36] <hellyeah> and i will beat bus
[08:16:40] <Xatenev> taplar: never heard that before, funny tho
[08:16:44] <hellyeah> screw the hell up
[08:16:52] <taplar> Xatenev: bus factor?
[08:16:57] <Xatenev> taplar: ye
[08:17:27] <Xatenev> taplar: not a common idiom in germany i guess
[08:17:43] <hellyeah> bus
[08:17:46] <hellyeah> masculine
[08:17:50] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:18:45] <taplar> i don't hear it a lot, but i've heard it enough to remember it
[08:19:15] <taplar> usually when talking about certain groups in our shop that have a high factor, :)
[08:20:12] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:20:24] <hellyeah> my collegue have more experience
[08:20:31] <hellyeah> he just got some suggestion from me
[08:20:41] <hellyeah> sounds like a good news for rookie
[08:21:07] <taplar> spread the knowledge man
[08:22:57] <hellyeah> yeah sure
[08:23:40] <hellyeah> you know i am doing something i am preparing a document that contains my code "jsfiddle" and what i read so far in a well readable format surronded by square.
[08:24:04] <hellyeah> so my co-worker can find anything by looking up explanation and code is properly documented.
[08:24:19] <taplar> cool
[08:25:17] <taplar> while your doing that, reconsider your code
[08:25:27] <taplar> is there a better way you could do it to self-document?
[08:26:57] <taplar> if your having to make a lot of comments about a small piece of code, then that's kinda a code smell
[08:27:45] <hellyeah> this smell is bad or tasty?
[08:27:57] <slax0r> usually rotten
[08:28:04] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell
[08:28:08] <hellyeah> thats harsh
[08:28:29] <hellyeah> ehehe
[08:28:37] <hellyeah> but it is for teaching
[08:28:47] <slax0r> what's harsher is that I later get this code to debug and I have to read a whole novel of comments to understand it
[08:28:55] <taplar> ^
[08:29:18] <Xatenev> damn, thats some first world problems, having to read too many comments
[08:29:18] <Xatenev> xd
[08:29:24] <taplar> lol
[08:29:28] <hellyeah> slax0r: taplar told me code most be document itself
[08:29:38] <taplar> self-documenting
[08:29:43] <hellyeah> function name, variable name
[08:29:46] <slax0r> I'd rather use my time for something else than to try to decipher some bad design choices
[08:29:57] <slax0r> hellyeah: to an extent that it doesn't hinder readability yeah
[08:30:07] <slax0r> I also don't want to read a whole novel every time I interpret a var name
[08:30:44] <hellyeah> slax0r: think about person who are you collegue does know jquery
[08:30:58] <taplar> slax0r is saying don't go to the extreme
[08:31:04] <taplar> you can always take a good thing too far
[08:31:06] <hellyeah> well when you select element you should comment as this way you can select element etc.
[08:31:19] <hellyeah> well i got it
[08:31:21] <slax0r> why would you comment a clear line?
[08:31:36] <hellyeah> it is just an example
[08:31:48] <slax0r> $(".user-profile .avatar").attr("src", "some url")
[08:31:53] <slax0r> I don't need a comment on this line
[08:32:07] <hellyeah> one of my cmment
[08:32:10] <hellyeah> you can bind more then one events to button. Normally you can add event to button in jquery is like that.
[08:32:10] <hellyeah> Button has a lot of event jquery web site is place to go indeed.
[08:32:10] <hellyeah> $(‘.buttonClass’).on(‘click’.function(){}); you can do with this way this is binding event.
[08:32:10] <hellyeah> Var x = function(){] $(‘.buttonClass’).on(‘click’, x); you can also use that way. The thing you need to focus on here, you type x instead of x(). The reason of that you give the function content for invoking in button click.   So button can have more than one job.
[08:32:16] <slax0r> comment only complex code blocks, and before you comment think if you can refactor it
[08:32:32] <slax0r> and try to refactor so you wont need comments
[08:32:34] <hellyeah> sorry for my english btw
[08:32:52] <hellyeah> slax0r: gotcha
[08:33:06] <slax0r> commenting complex blocks of code is dangerous anyway, because right now when you are doing it, you still "understand" how it works, and you'll maybe forget to note something
[08:33:17] <slax0r> I've shot myself in the leg with such comments before
[08:33:36] <taplar> in this case since it's for reference i don't really see a problem with those comments.  i just wouldn't want them to be migrated into the development/prod code base
[08:34:01] <hellyeah> no no
[08:34:09] <taplar> those comments are more about language features, rather than business logic
[08:34:21] <hellyeah> i mean developmen/prod case comment may be like one or two lines
[08:34:37] <hellyeah> about what function do why do i need that function etc.
[08:34:37] <taplar> i was referring to your comments about the usage of on()
[08:34:46] <hellyeah> one or two lines
[08:35:13] <hellyeah> taplar: yes this is what my aim is
[08:35:23] <hellyeah> business logic is not issue here
[08:35:33] <hellyeah> it must be about language feature
[08:35:39] <taplar> hmm?
[08:35:42] <slax0r> except in doc blocks, I get pretty descriptive there, but dunno if docblocks are a thing in JS world
[08:35:47] <hellyeah> because my collegue need to learn how to use stuff
[08:35:58] <taplar> right
[08:36:07] <hellyeah> and i try to shorten his way to pass production phase
[08:36:09] <slax0r> for me a docblock should explain in detail how and what, so one can know without looking at the code what a method does
[08:36:23] <slax0r> and I usually have them folded anyway, so the don't bother me
[08:36:32] <taplar> i would argue the function should be named better, :)
[08:36:45] <Xatenev> slax0r: I tend to name the function just a bit longer so the name already says exactly what it does
[08:36:49] <hellyeah> taplar: this is other example
[08:36:51] <hellyeah> AJAX is really important thing you can have async environment by using AJAX. Also JSON javascript object notation can be good friend while establishing connection between frontend and backend. You can find some usage and example below.
[08:36:51] <hellyeah> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[08:36:51] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/j3moc6h7/ ajax, to get json string from backend and some stuff
[08:37:22] <slax0r> Xatenev: taplar in some cases yeah, it works, in some it doesn't
[08:37:22] <hellyeah> like tutorial and example
[08:37:56] <hellyeah> but i am amateur i am just search a way
[08:37:59] <taplar> i'm sure.  though then i might also wonder if in those cases the function is trying to do too much
[08:38:02] <hellyeah> searching*
[08:38:20] <taplar> but it's all relative
[08:38:40] <slax0r> and it all depends, as always ;)
[08:38:45] <taplar> yep
[08:38:46] <Xatenev> in the end it doesnt matter anyways
[08:38:47] <Xatenev> xd
[08:38:50] <Xatenev> just stick to one thing
[08:38:57] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:38:58] <taplar> ohhhh, your going to make me pop in linkin park...
[08:39:12] <hellyeah> Xatenev: what is?
[08:39:36] <Xatenev> hellyeah: what we talked about just inb4
[08:40:01] <hellyeah> hmm
[08:40:07] <hellyeah> dont have any idea
[08:40:08] <hellyeah> hahaha
[08:40:31] <hellyeah> taplar: well i will try to help
[08:40:36] <hellyeah> i like this philosophy
[08:40:45] <hellyeah> i guess this is open source philosophy
[08:40:45] <mikecmpbll> not strictly a jquery question, but is anyone able to shed any light on why this select2 dropdown inside a bootstrap popover isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/mikecmpbll/u72ffs0u/ (xposted to ##bootstrap)
[08:41:43] <nru> Cork
[08:41:45] <nru> i am back
[08:41:53] <hellyeah> nru:wel come back
[08:41:58] <nru> :)
[08:42:08] <hellyeah> brb
[08:42:19] <slax0r> Cork: run ^^
[08:42:28] <Cork> heh
[08:42:31] <nru> aaaahahhaha
[08:42:41] <Cork> nru: check the jsfiddles
[08:42:48] <nru> yes the serialize i see
[08:42:59] <Cork> there is something your not telling, cause like i said before, it works as intended
[08:43:09] <nru> hmm how can i best explain :D
[08:43:24] <Cork> nru: you need to reproduce where you get the wrong output
[08:43:30] <Cork> so ppl can look at it
[08:43:46] <Cork> currently all the info you've provided doesn't show the problem
[08:43:53] <nru> hmm let me try to reproduce
[08:44:03] <nru> come back to you when it works
[08:44:12] <nru> i mean the reproduction
[08:51:58] <nru> cork
[08:52:28] <nru> can i pm you the link ?
[08:52:46] <Cork> sure
[08:53:43] <Cork> nru: that code doesn't work...
[09:00:23] <nru> hmm yes will not work because it will also use some php files
[09:00:31] <nru> :/
[09:05:28] <Cork> nru: so ya, you need to either provide a live link showing the problem
[09:05:37] <Cork> nru: or reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[09:05:54] <Cork> but by reproduce it means it has to show the problem
[09:46:58] <ThiefMaster> is the order in which event handlers for custom events are triggered determinstic? (e.g. in order of registration of the handlers)
[09:48:19] <taplar> iirc the last bound fires first
[09:51:58] <Xatenev> the first bound fires first.
[09:52:04] <Xatenev> @ ThiefMaster
[09:52:08] <taplar> or that
[09:56:35] <hellyeah> hey
[09:56:56] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/SJ7bJ/919/ when you click date here it seems on the input box but how can i get this value? http://jsfiddle.net/SJ7bJ/919/
[10:08:51] <Tennis> hellyeah sorry not 100% sure i follow
[10:09:07] <hellyeah> my question is when i pick the date how can i get value to the console pls help http://jsfiddle.net/ex8eaepe/1/
[10:09:08] <Tennis> when you click inside the input field you get the date picker
[10:09:14] <Tennis> too the console
[10:09:18] <Tennis> ok erm
[10:09:31] <hellyeah> i want to see 12/05/2015 on the console for example
[10:09:37] <hellyeah> i inspect the element
[10:09:46] <hellyeah> but i couldnt see date value on the dom
[10:09:52] <FilipNortic> trigger on change?
[10:10:21] <hellyeah> yes i guess so
[10:10:45] <cluelessperson> Hey all.  I have a situation in which I want to copy a browser image before performing an ajax request
[10:11:14] <cluelessperson> Is it possible to just get a data url, and define a new image src on the side?
[10:11:20] <Tennis> console.log($(this).val()); this works but like only after you select a second one
[10:12:04] <Tennis> http://jsfiddle.net/SJ7bJ/920/
[10:12:35] <Tennis> yeah filips right make a change listener and log it ther
[10:13:16] <hellyeah> i did that http://jsfiddle.net/ex8eaepe/1/
[10:15:18] <taplar> uh, if your doing to do your datepicker initialize in a focus event, make sure to bind your focus event with one()
[10:15:23] <taplar> crap
[10:15:25] <taplar> no
[10:15:29] <taplar> you don't want to do it like that
[10:15:41] <taplar> your going to be initializing multiple times, or only for one child
[10:16:04] <taplar> initialize your datepicker after you append it
[10:19:32] <shoky> hellyeah: use the datepicker's onSelect option
[10:19:39] <cluelessperson> Does anyone know an elegant solution to getting imagedata ?
[10:20:07] <hellyeah> there is no change event here https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/ but i used change http://jsfiddle.net/ex8eaepe/2/ i am confused
[10:20:19] <hellyeah> shoky: let me take a look
[10:20:23] <shoky> hellyeah: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[10:21:30] <hellyeah> but
[10:21:31] <shoky> "Called when the datepicker is selected"   bad wording there
[10:21:33] <hellyeah> how cchange event works
[10:21:50] <hellyeah> change is input's event?
[10:22:39] <shoky> hellyeah: jquery-ui triggers the change event too.
[10:25:25] <hellyeah> so
[10:25:50] <hellyeah> $('.datapicker').triggers('click', function() is okey to use?
[10:26:00] <shoky> huh?
[10:26:12] <shoky> that doesn't make any sense
[10:26:21] <shoky> also there's no .triggers method ;p
[10:26:21] <hellyeah> ah okey
[10:26:27] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[10:26:41] <shoky> your english is fine ;)
[10:26:48] <hellyeah> shoky: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[10:27:01] <shoky> that's for triggering events.. you don't need it.
[10:27:10] <hellyeah> ah okey
[10:27:32] <hellyeah> hellyeah: jquery-ui triggers the change event too.  i didnt understand that sentence exactly
[10:28:16] <shoky> jquery-ui  causes the "change" event to fire on the input.  that's the answer to your previous question about how there is a change event
[10:28:35] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[10:28:41] <hellyeah> i got it
[10:28:49] <shoky> i didn't say you should trigger anything yourself. jquery-ui already does it . but you don't need the change event here
[10:28:58] <shoky> you need the onSelect option
[10:29:10] <shoky> which already gives you the text as first argument
[10:29:11] <hellyeah> i guess widget documentation is helper here
[10:29:53] <hellyeah> i got it thanks
[10:30:00] <hellyeah> my collegue asked me question
[10:30:03] <hellyeah> i am excited
[10:30:04] <hellyeah> xD
[10:30:08] <hellyeah> brb
[11:08:55] <Mark___> does anyone know why this specific jquery plugin creates huge blank spaces below the board? it disappears when i disable the plugin, but i don’t know how to get rid of it. http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/index.php?mid=board_iBLY65&document_srl=2406&act=dispBoardWrite#undefined
[12:28:02] <nerium> Does anyone know a good alternitive to jQuery Mobile?
[12:28:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> bold strategy :) what are you looking for in particular?
[12:28:56] <nerium> robertmaxrees: me?
[12:28:59] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:29:32] <nerium> robertmaxrees: Something similar which isn’t a full framework like ionic, ember or angular
[12:29:46] <robertmaxrees> so then what needs to you need fulfilled?
[12:30:25] <robertmaxrees> and ionic, ember, and angular are distinct from jqm.
[12:31:04] <nerium> robertmaxrees: A lib I can just include which makes use of the already existing markup
[12:31:15] <nerium> So I dont want to define my own routes and stuff like that
[12:31:35] <robertmaxrees> ionic is a little closer i guess, though not necessarily - it's for hybric mobile apps.  ember and angular are generic frontend frameworks, not necessarily specific to mobile.  jqm is a generap-purpose mobile framework.
[12:32:01] <robertmaxrees> i mean, jqm is about as close are you're going to get to that.  what don't you like about JQM?
[12:32:43] <nerium> robertmaxrees: its slow and no longer maintained. i’ve been using it for the past 2 years and its still in production but it’s way to slow
[12:33:06] <robertmaxrees> actually, jquery mobile is very actively maintained.  the next major version is going to bring some big changes :)
[12:34:07] <robertmaxrees> anyway, I'm not familiar with anything that fulfills your needs.  i'd suggest something like angular or react, but you'll have to bring in most of your own code and things.
[12:34:13] <nerium> not accoring to what I’ve read and seen. but I can’t wait any longer, it’s still to slow
[12:34:15] <robertmaxrees> soooo maybe somebody else will have an idea :)
[12:34:49] <robertmaxrees> what are you reading?
[12:34:53] <nerium> I’m aready using ember and angular for other apps, but that’s complex for this
[12:35:05] <nerium> robertmaxrees: just google jquery mobile dead
[12:35:12] <nerium> and look at the ”pulse” on the github repo
[12:35:26] <robertmaxrees> have you read the blog at all recently?
[12:35:31] <taplar> the github for jqm was updated 6 days ago
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> and seen any of the stuff going on with jquery?
[12:35:48] <taplar> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[12:36:07] <nerium> taplar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulse
[12:36:11] <robertmaxrees> sure - but there's something bigger going on outside of the repo soooo...
[12:36:55] <robertmaxrees> either way, it sounds like what you want is to move away from JQM and onto something else.  i can't think of anything that's full service like it so i dunno what to tell you :)
[12:37:17] <nerium> Something equal to jqm would have been nive
[12:38:02] <robertmaxrees> sure - i'm not sure something like that exists.  last i checked, JQM is moving toward just a toolkit for mobile development, instead of the full drop-in mobile solution it's been.
[12:53:56] <scottchiefbaker> I'm upgrading for JQeryUI 1.10 to 1.11... Do I need jqueuy-ui.css the structure.css and the theme CSS now?
[13:05:06] <christophe_v_e> Hey guys .. I'm having quite an issue. I have several questions which each have 3 radio buttons. I want to make a script that checks my entire page and allows a maximum of 3 checked radio buttons ... if they are followed by a label with the value "For".
[13:06:16] <robertmaxrees> start with a fiddle then.
[13:06:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:06:47] <taplar> maximum of three checked radio buttons...
[13:07:26] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e wait, so only three questions can be answered?
[13:08:11] <christophe_v_e> robertmaxrees: No, I have 6 questions, but of those 6 questions I only want to allow only 3 questions to be answered with "For" .. which can only be deduced by the label that follows the input.
[13:08:30] <taplar> could you not logically hide/disable 3/6 questions?
[13:08:33] <robertmaxrees> 'with "for"' - this makes me nervous.
[13:08:34] <christophe_v_e> I have no luck on stackoverflow
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your markup isn't setup in a logical fashion,.
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you have?
[13:09:05] <christophe_v_e> People are allowed to vote "for" "against" and "abstain" .. the poll is generated by the plugin YOP Poll, so I have no control over ID's etc.
[13:09:14] <christophe_v_e> Certainly, hold on.
[13:10:53] <Cyclohexane> Why isn't this working? http://pastebin.com/kke31Uac I want to add a CSRF token to the AJAX POST request - it's running on a separate AJAX request but not that particular one
[13:11:49] <christophe_v_e> taplar: they want to show all options at all times
[13:12:04] <christophe_v_e> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/EWEmcKkD      &     http://puu.sh/lMSHY/d6d166dead.png
[13:12:43] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e so http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a96f1ybo/ ?
[13:12:58] <christophe_v_e> I can set the votes to a maximum of 3 votes total .. but not votes for a specific kind of vote.. and from what I can gather the only indicator I can find of "these kind of votes" is that they are followed by the label ..
[13:13:32] <christophe_v_e> Yup
[13:13:46] <christophe_v_e> I can indent it a bit better first if you'd like.
[13:14:58] <robertmaxrees> so back up - you only want three answers period?  or no more than three "for"s?
[13:16:27] <christophe_v_e> No more than three for's. The code I showed you is for the first voting page, so there it would only be 1 "for". But it should also be applied to a set of 6 questions, where there can only be 3.
[13:16:34] <hellyeah> hey
[13:16:47] <hellyeah> taplar:  are you still online?
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> err, are they all on the same page, christophe_v_e?
[13:17:05] <taplar> yup
[13:17:31] <christophe_v_e> Yes - one page has 2 questions - 1 for allowed. The next page has 6 questions, 3 fors allowed. Different pages.
[13:17:35] <hellyeah> do you know about scrum?
[13:17:46] <taplar> sure
[13:18:09] <taplar> i know the word.  i'd have to double check i correctly know the meaning
[13:18:17] <robertmaxrees> aaaah scrum.
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e so really, each page is a question, and half of those should allow a single "for"?
[13:18:48] <robertmaxrees> independently of the rest of the pages?
[13:19:35] <robertmaxrees> because that's easy-ish, though you're going to get into some weird state management.
[13:19:36] <christophe_v_e> Um. It's simple .. There's one page with 2 questions for which we can only allow one "for" vote. http://puu.sh/lMThX/7c1551e539.png
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> screenshots are never helpful fwiw.
[13:20:14] <christophe_v_e> Oh. Well. The code I provided is what that page is.
[13:20:26] <robertmaxrees> right, just making sure i understand the scope of the issue.
[13:20:34] <taplar> hellyeah: what's your q?
[13:20:39] <hellyeah> scrum agile that stuff
[13:20:46] <hellyeah> q?
[13:20:49] <taplar> question
[13:20:57] <hellyeah> ah okey
[13:21:04] <hellyeah> can i learn about this from net?
[13:21:15] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scrum_%28software_development%29&wasRedirected=true
[13:21:20] <taplar> google it up
[13:21:53] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e so every time somebody picks "for", push that answer into an array.  if the array is already three items long, grab the first one, deselect that one, and push in your new "for"
[13:22:10] <hellyeah> i mean with details i dont know anything about that thanks for the link btw
[13:22:27] <taplar> scrums are about trying to solve a small part of the problem, not the entire problem
[13:22:34] <taplar> because it can change on you
[13:22:46] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah lots of general about scrum and angile in general.  know that everybody does it a little differently - your team will figure the right wayu for them organically.
[13:22:49] <hellyeah> problem can change?
[13:22:53] <taplar> yep
[13:23:07] <taplar> what a user thinks they want and what they really want are often two different things
[13:23:19] <hellyeah> problem or approach the problem can change or approaching the problem can change the problem
[13:23:31] <robertmaxrees> and the LOE to get that done can drastically change once you get into the codebase.
[13:23:45] <hellyeah> hmm ic
[13:23:58] <hellyeah> i need to learn about those stuff anyway
[13:24:01] <taplar> it's also hard to talk about a solution in an imaginative sort
[13:24:12] <hellyeah> i have a question du to all respect to taplar :)
[13:24:13] <taplar> it's easier to look at something and say, "i don't like that"
[13:24:15] <taplar> and "i want this"
[13:24:19] <christophe_v_e> Um. Ok, I'll try to work something out, I'm not great with js - all I do is look around on stackoverflow and try to combine things I find.
[13:24:27] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e we can help you write that.
[13:24:28] <hellyeah> imaginative sort
[13:24:33] <hellyeah> hmm thats new thing
[13:24:37] <taplar> there's a better word, i can't think of
[13:24:38] <hellyeah> let me google it
[13:24:39] <robertmaxrees> what part of that explanation are you confused by?
[13:24:46] <taplar> obscure?
[13:24:59] <taplar> abstract!
[13:25:10] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah thinking about how you're going to do something and actually doing it are different things.
[13:25:11] <taplar> it's hard for users to think abstractly
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> ^ yep.
[13:25:25] <hellyeah> ^
[13:25:33] <taplar> a +2, damn!
[13:25:56] <taplar> that's going in the diary, :)
[13:26:01] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:26:06] <hellyeah> btw carrying message to third person (user) is really important aspect i guess
[13:26:23] <hellyeah> someone coding the other one tell the problem to coder
[13:26:34] <taplar> eh?
[13:26:38] <hellyeah> but someone has to tell what is the solution for current problem
[13:26:51] <hellyeah> express this things must be hard
[13:26:54] <taplar> the user, in the best case, dos
[13:26:57] <taplar> *does
[13:27:02] <robertmaxrees> i disagree, taplar
[13:27:06] <hellyeah> because third person doesnt know anything about nature of programming
[13:27:08] <christophe_v_e> Well, I'm not sure how I would find when somebody picks "for". I think I'd need to check for "on click" or "select" or something along those lines. Then doing anything with arrays always confuses me. So pushing it in and checkings its length will also be .. hard for me.
[13:27:19] <christophe_v_e> But I do understand lines when I read them.
[13:27:20] <hellyeah> btw my english is restricted
[13:27:26] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e you're use a "change" event listener.
[13:27:27] <hellyeah> i hope you understand what i typed
[13:27:30] <robertmaxrees> and arrays are simple.
[13:27:49] <taplar> my view is probably skewed by my intranet development.  you disagree?
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> taplar very much so. there should be a well defined set of reqs.  if there's ambiguity or issues, that should go through a PM first.
[13:28:31] <taplar> sure sure
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> doing discovery ahead of time, on the other hand - that's cool.
[13:28:47] <robertmaxrees> but spending lots of dev hours to define the problem without vetting?  that makes me nervous.
[13:29:35] <taplar> sure, but that speaks to the whole scrum, iterative approach.  not trying to figure out the entire thing up front
[13:30:19] <hellyeah> vetting?
[13:30:24] <hellyeah> what does that mean?
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> just making sure people know to split the "discovery" tasks from the "doing" tasks.
[13:30:58] <hellyeah> discovery task contain how to do stuff?
[13:31:02] <robertmaxrees> never.
[13:31:09] <hellyeah> i mean what way you need to follow
[13:31:20] <taplar> discovery is asking what users want, or what problems exist
[13:31:28] <hellyeah> ic
[13:31:31] <taplar> identifying pain points
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> and making sure that what they're asking for is really going to solve their problem.
[13:31:43] <taplar> ^
[13:31:45] <robertmaxrees> because 9/10, users don't know what they really need.
[13:31:45] <hellyeah> how does infinite development cycle sound?
[13:31:55] <taplar> lol
[13:32:03] <taplar> great for job security probably
[13:32:06] <hellyeah> my manager adds requirement constantly
[13:32:10] <taplar> ugh
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> then your manager is getting pressured and isn't pushing back.
[13:32:25] <hellyeah> i finished and he asked me to do new things
[13:32:27] <robertmaxrees> how many people on your team, hellyeah?
[13:32:32] <hellyeah> 3
[13:32:46] <robertmaxrees> eh, you probably won't get much value out of scrum/agile.
[13:32:49] <hellyeah> w e are two coders actually
[13:33:05] <hellyeah> the other one doesnt know javascript
[13:33:10] <taplar> so 1
[13:33:13] <hellyeah> i need to support him
[13:33:15] <robertmaxrees> like, you'll maybe get a little, but with such a small team it sounds like you have other issues to solve.
[13:33:24] <hellyeah> i need to tell how to solve the problem
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> what's your tracking system?  JIRA?  Gemini?
[13:34:05] <hellyeah> JIRA
[13:34:21] <hellyeah> but in our department we dont use that afaik
[13:34:28] <robertmaxrees> what do you use instead?
[13:34:37] <taplar> the manager tells him to do stuff, heh
[13:34:43] <hellyeah> the problem is i need to solve requirement
[13:34:49] <robertmaxrees> (if you say email/im/anything else, i know where your problem is)
[13:34:52] <hellyeah> i need to support my collegue
[13:35:03] * taplar awaits the answer with baited breath
[13:35:14] <hellyeah> also someone out of deprtment ask me to make some idea about a problem
[13:35:18] <robertmaxrees> your department should use some kind of task tracking/project management system.  like JIRA.
[13:35:24] <hellyeah> email
[13:35:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, get that into JIRA.
[13:35:34] <robertmaxrees> use it.  love it.  track with it.
[13:35:48] <hellyeah> bank use JIRA widely
[13:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you guys should use it, too.
[13:35:59] <christophe_v_e> robertmaxrees: yeah  .. no .. I've been looking the past few minutes to find something to check for the label "for" and when that is selected, but I'm getting nothing.
[13:36:01] <hellyeah> i guess the requirement system is very amateur
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e show me what you've tried.
[13:36:14] <christophe_v_e> I have been trying to get something from this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7038282/javascript-select-input-event
[13:36:25] <christophe_v_e> and http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_getelementsbytagname.asp
[13:36:30] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e show me code that you've tried.
[13:36:46] <hellyeah> christophe_v_e: you should fiddle
[13:37:03] <hellyeah> btw most of people said w3schools suck
[13:37:09] <hellyeah> why dont you try mdn?
[13:37:10] <robertmaxrees> also: learn.jquery.com is a solid tutorial you should try - avoid w3schools
[13:37:31] <christophe_v_e> I've tried just pasting something in that I found, but I wouldn't know what to adjust or add. http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/2/
[13:37:40] <christophe_v_e> Ok, I'm bookmarking it
[13:37:46] <robertmaxrees> use jquery for this instead.
[13:38:02] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to bind an event listener?
[13:38:16] <christophe_v_e> I've been developing for a while now, but I've never really stumbled accross something that I couldn't copy paste.
[13:38:25] <robertmaxrees> then you're not developing.
[13:38:31] <christophe_v_e> Nope, well maybe I do, but not in those terms.
[13:38:42] <taplar> hellyeah: the point of the tracking system, at least in the way we use it, is to help facilitate the breaking down of work.  you make the cards/post whatever it's called for each thing that needs done.  something else comes in, it gets it's own new thing.  so you finish one thing before startinga another.  there is a clear start and done for each think
[13:38:43] <taplar> *thing
[13:39:18] <christophe_v_e> I do wordpress development, but I've always received great help when I got stuck - but yeah, I get what you mean.
[13:39:18] <hellyeah> christophe_v_e:  you should use queryselectorall or go with jquery
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> taplar right, and the other reason is because it helps the outside business understand how long it takes for things to get done.  leads to higher quality requests.
[13:39:28] <hellyeah> you should use foreach instead of for
[13:39:30] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e we're here to help, not do.
[13:39:32] <christophe_v_e> Alright. I'll do some looking up.
[13:39:38] <robertmaxrees> and don't use a for loop here.
[13:39:40] <robertmaxrees> it's not what you want.
[13:39:47] <robertmaxrees> start by binding an event listener.
[13:39:48] <christophe_v_e> I understand ;) I'm trying, we'll get there.
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> i'll walk you through this.
[13:40:19] <hellyeah> you can use addEventListener
[13:40:25] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[13:40:30] <robertmaxrees> since this is #jquery ;)
[13:40:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, go to ##javascript.
[13:40:34] <hellyeah> or something.on('event, function()
[13:40:42] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah slow down duder - they're learning.
[13:40:51] <hellyeah> sorry :p
[13:41:11] <hellyeah> i feel excited cuz i am answering :D
[13:41:17] <taplar> heh
[13:41:25] <robertmaxrees> that's fine, but you're not really helping :) you're overwhelming them.
[13:41:35] <taplar> he's on() it!
[13:41:38] <hellyeah> sorry i realized
[13:41:47] <hellyeah> yeah i am on() it
[13:41:58] <hellyeah> you know i am like teacher of my co worker
[13:42:08] <hellyeah> ehe
[13:42:21] <taplar> actually i have a point to make about that too
[13:42:40] <hellyeah> make about what?
[13:42:43] <taplar> have a discussion with your manager if you have not already.  find out how much time your being allowed to 'train' this other person
[13:42:55] <taplar> just so you know
[13:43:07] <hellyeah> ic
[13:43:09] <christophe_v_e> Alright, I'm trying to piece stuff together, hold on.
[13:43:51] <hellyeah> something is wrong here taplar we aare being forced to use some tech we dont know. There must be some decent education perid
[13:43:55] <hellyeah> am i right?
[13:44:02] <hellyeah> they just want quick result
[13:44:06] <taplar> sometimes on the job is all you get
[13:44:10] <hellyeah> i guess this is realiy of life
[13:44:28] <hellyeah> ^
[13:44:48] <hellyeah> but you know i am doing 20 different things with js
[13:44:48] <taplar> i just don't want you to go full on training him, if your manager still wants you to progress on your other stuff
[13:45:01] <hellyeah> now i need to put all piece together
[13:45:07] <taplar> because if the other guy is very demanding, or in need, of your tutalige(sp), then that will hurt you
[13:45:07] <hellyeah> still he request some stuff
[13:45:21] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wp9f57eh/3/ - here's an event listener.
[13:45:24] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[13:45:39] <hellyeah> taplar:  thats true
[13:45:52] <hellyeah> i need to balance those things
[13:45:58] <hellyeah> here is what i try to do
[13:46:33] <hellyeah> when he ask something i will give some example to him. He will need to understand stuff before moving on
[13:46:44] <hellyeah> i wont give him solution or something
[13:46:55] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah stop giving examples, then - teach him how to fish.
[13:47:22] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  should i give answer?
[13:47:37] <robertmaxrees> never - hence "teach him how to fish".
[13:47:51] <robertmaxrees> teach him how to find answers himself.
[13:47:54] <taplar> he can google just like you
[13:48:02] <robertmaxrees> MDN is a great resource.
[13:48:23] <hellyeah> yeah sure
[13:48:31] <robertmaxrees> same with jquery.
[13:48:37] <hellyeah> today i told him if you use jquery ui
[13:48:53] <hellyeah> you can find all relevant infos about the thing you will use in widget menu
[13:49:09] <hellyeah> he just wrote some code and using focus event
[13:49:18] <hellyeah> when i asked him why you use focus event
[13:49:25] <hellyeah> he said i dont know i just take it
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> it's ok to type in whole sentences before hitting enter btw ;)
[13:49:45] <hellyeah> that make me little nervous honestly
[13:50:00] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  sure i am sorry i will do that
[13:50:56] <christophe_v_e> Ok, so we have the event listener. Now I suppose we're getting the label "for" .. and then count if it has that label?
[13:51:09] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e not yet.
[13:51:27] <robertmaxrees> first you want to see if the user selected the "for" option.
[13:51:27] <hellyeah> fortunately taplar" gave me good lecutre about how to approach to this prblem
[13:51:31] <hellyeah> :)
[13:51:37] <taplar> is that a tm?
[13:51:52] <hellyeah> tm?
[13:51:56] <taplar> lol, nvm
[13:52:13] <hellyeah> sorry taplar i dont know abbreveation
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e start with checking that - do you know how to do that?
[13:52:42] <taplar> i saw your ' taplar" ' and in my small font thought you threw in a trademark character
[13:53:15] <hellyeah> accidentally hit the key
[13:53:29] <hellyeah> taplar:  what i meant is i saw the way you teach me stuff
[13:53:47] <hellyeah> you didnt give the answwer but correct direction for solving the problem
[13:53:54] <hellyeah> so it was like a lecture
[13:53:55] <taplar> hopefully
[13:53:58] <taplar> heh
[13:54:04] <christophe_v_e> The only way I'd know to do that is to look vor the label value? Or just the first option?
[13:54:06] <robertmaxrees> which is exactly what you wnat to do.
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e look at the label for the thing that changed.
[13:54:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  you gave sometimes but it is rare :D
[13:55:17] <hellyeah> but i need video tutorial comprehensive may be i can but something from plural sight
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e the smart way to do that would be to get the current element's parent <li> and then find the label contained in there.
[13:57:00] <christophe_v_e> alright, let me google that :)
[13:57:15] <hellyeah> DOM is like tree you can traverse it with like parent, find, closest, next there are relevant?
[13:57:22] <robertmaxrees> really?  you don't know how to get parent elements in jquery?
[13:57:57] <hellyeah> parent()
[13:58:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd opt for .closest()
[13:58:17] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, .parent() works, .parents() can be helpful, too.
[13:58:20] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[13:58:26] <robertmaxrees> just kind of surprised they don't know this.
[13:59:11] <hellyeah> closest('td')
[13:59:19] <christophe_v_e> I would use: console.log($(this).parent().tagName(label));
[13:59:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:59:37] <christophe_v_e> Well, I've heard of those things but I never actually used or applied them
[13:59:54] <christophe_v_e> so I'm not sure how to put everything in to practice with the vague understanding I have
[13:59:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd use .closest() and .find() here.
[14:01:16] <christophe_v_e> Alright, so I'm logging this:  console.log($(this).closest("li").find("label"));
[14:01:20] <christophe_v_e> gets me an object
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:01:28] <robertmaxrees> you probably want the text of that, right?>
[14:01:47] <robertmaxrees> see if it's a for, against, or abstension, yeah?
[14:02:02] <christophe_v_e> certainly
[14:02:13] <robertmaxrees> so then how do you think you'd get the text?
[14:02:46] <christophe_v_e> I've found the label, so I'd check if the value is "for", stuff it in the array, if not .. nothing
[14:02:52] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> not the value.
[14:02:56] <robertmaxrees> the text.
[14:03:01] <christophe_v_e> Ok, makes sense.
[14:03:14] <robertmaxrees> and you need to stuff WHAT in that array? :)
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> these classes and IDs are scary, btw.
[14:04:11] <christophe_v_e> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wp9f57eh/3/
[14:04:22] <robertmaxrees> i already sent that to you.
[14:04:25] <robertmaxrees> hit "update" and try again.
[14:04:31] <christophe_v_e> http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/4/
[14:04:44] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so now what?
[14:05:34] <christophe_v_e> if selectedlabel is For?
[14:05:58] <christophe_v_e> I'm not sure what to put in the array - to answer your earlier question.
[14:07:32] <robertmaxrees> well, you need some kind of unique identifier for that question, right?
[14:08:21] <christophe_v_e> http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/5/
[14:08:26] <christophe_v_e> Sorry, unique identifier?
[14:08:41] * hellyeah i dont like console of ie
[14:08:51] <robertmaxrees> you need to know which one was selected, right?
[14:09:37] <robertmaxrees> and use console logs, not alerts.
[14:10:03] <christophe_v_e> Yes, I need to know which one was selected. Ok, logs, not alerts.
[14:10:24] <robertmaxrees> so you need something that uniquely identifies the one that was selected, right?
[14:10:54] <christophe_v_e> Certainly, yes, um ..?
[14:11:08] <robertmaxrees> what's the "um" for?
[14:11:12] <robertmaxrees> what isn't clicking here?
[14:11:19] <hellyeah> there is keyword for that
[14:12:55] <christophe_v_e> Well I don't know how to uniquely identify the clicked item .. and how to store it
[14:13:05] <robertmaxrees> well, look at the HTML.
[14:13:31] <robertmaxrees> you should see a TON of IDs - i'd store the ID for that DIV that wraps the UL.
[14:14:50] <christophe_v_e> alright, again with closest?
[14:15:03] <robertmaxrees> read the docs and tell me yourself :)
[14:15:37] <christophe_v_e> closest travels up, makes sense to use closest here in my mind
[14:15:38] <hellyeah> you want to get what value you click right
[14:15:50] <christophe_v_e> I just didn't want to select the .. next closest div, if you know what I mean?

[14:17:09] <Adever> i didn't still able when the tinder of big boobs open: this inferior to get used to see
[14:17:27] <christophe_v_e> .. do bots come here a lot?
[14:17:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:37] <christophe_v_e> lame
[14:17:39] <robertmaxrees> well, sometimes.  it's waves.
[14:18:29] <hellyeah> christophe_v_e:  what will you do exactly? Can you briefly explain?
[14:18:35] <robertmaxrees> he's already explained it.
[14:18:36] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:18:53] <hellyeah> i just missed that :p
[14:18:55] <robertmaxrees> he wants to make sure no more than half the options on a page get a "for" vote.
[14:18:57] <christophe_v_e> Well I think I'd go look for the closest div and store it's id. Not sure where i'd store it and if it needs storing as a var
[14:19:16] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e this is where the array comes in handy.
[14:19:43] <hellyeah> check array's method for adding stuff
[14:21:40] <hellyeah> actually i dont want to interrupt but can i ask my question?
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:22:15] <christophe_v_e> Ok so lets say I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/6/   - I now create an array .. storing the ID?
[14:22:30] <robertmaxrees> the array should already exist.
[14:22:39] <hellyeah> can you drag a onto e and you see the output i want to see both button in same order how can i fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/j2eco7u9/22/
[14:22:42] <christophe_v_e> I don't understand.
[14:23:05] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e if you create the array inside the event handler, it won't exist the next time it runs.
[14:23:15] <robertmaxrees> ie the array will "go away" after the handler is done running.
[14:24:17] <robertmaxrees> so you want to create the array outside of the handler.
[14:25:05] <hellyeah> js has logic of scope right?
[14:25:09] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:25:39] <mutante> i have a .json log file of a webserver, i can do "jq .uri_host <file>" to get just the uri_host. could you help me with the syntax to get multiple fields? like ".uri host .referer"? i can't figure it out, must be too obvious
[14:25:53] <hellyeah> okey scope can be bit advanced here may be
[14:26:33] <robertmaxrees> and entirely relevant.
[14:26:34] <shoky> mutante uhh wrong channel? jq is not jquery ;p
[14:26:49] <hellyeah> christophe_v_e:  you need to define array outside of function
[14:26:52] <mutante> shoky: indeed. sorry
[14:27:17] <hellyeah> cuz the scope of event handle is dead after you click something again
[14:27:23] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[14:28:41] <christophe_v_e> alright
[14:28:47] <hellyeah> anything for me
[14:28:50] <robertmaxrees> that's... not really why, but okay ;)
[14:29:35] <hellyeah> christophe_v_e:  do you know var x = function () { ... }
[14:30:19] <christophe_v_e> You lost me
[14:30:32] <christophe_v_e> I can read and modify stuff, but can't write anything
[14:30:57] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e then learn :)
[14:31:03] <christophe_v_e> looking it up
[14:31:14] <hellyeah> >>
[14:31:18] <hellyeah> no
[14:31:21] <hellyeah> sorry
[14:31:40] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah and that question you asked has nothing to do with what they need to know right knwo :)
[14:33:02] <christophe_v_e> I've added var forDivs = [];
[14:33:02] <PokerGod> with var s = 'background-color: rgb(100,0,0)';  To use that with jQuery, $('.class').css(s);  Is there a way to pass in key: value pairs without splitting them?
[14:33:12] <hellyeah> okey sorry just what i mean is you can wrap your event with this definition. I am scared to make a mistake actually.
[14:33:21] <robertmaxrees> PokerGod you'll have to split no matter what.
[14:33:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah they can, but that has nothing to do with the problem they're solving for.
[14:33:39] <robertmaxrees> christophe_v_e great - show me.
[14:33:46] <robertmaxrees> :) need ot make sure it's in the right place.
[14:34:45] <christophe_v_e> http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/7/
[14:35:01] <christophe_v_e> i've also pushed something in there at the end, i think?
[14:35:03] <hellyeah> good night
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> yep, so what next?
[14:35:54] <christophe_v_e> well, I've lost why exactly I'm pushing the div ID, so I'm putting the push inside the "if label = for"
[14:36:13] <robertmaxrees> because you need a record of all selected "for"s
[14:36:23] <robertmaxrees> and you need to know the order it was done in.
[14:37:09] <PokerGod> robertmaxrees, how would you do it?  split on ',', each those, and then split on those?
[14:37:29] <PokerGod> :
[14:37:55] <robertmaxrees> PokerGod forEach them into an object, splitting each one along the way.
[14:37:58] <robertmaxrees> but i have to ask - why?
[14:38:06] <robertmaxrees> why is this not in a stylesheet?
[14:39:17] <christophe_v_e> I have to note, earlier you said I need to check to only allow half of the votes to be "for" votes. That's right for this exercise - but on the other poll there are 6 candidates at the moment, but it could become 7 or 8 - so I'm applying the script on two separate vote pages, so it would be nice if I could have a var to check for the limit of votes. In the first case that would be 1 "for" vote, in the second case it would be
[14:39:38] <robertmaxrees> that cut off.
[14:39:47] <robertmaxrees> but "half" is correct, right
[14:39:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:40:21] <robertmaxrees> because if so, we'll handle that later - for now, make a "maxAllowedForVotes" var and set it to 1 for now - we'll take care of that bit later.
[14:40:31] <christophe_v_e> alright
[14:42:54] <robertmaxrees> so what next?  step through this logically :)
[14:43:22] <christophe_v_e> So now at the end I'm checking the length of the array. And I realise I have to disallow another vote ..
[14:43:23] <christophe_v_e> http://jsfiddle.net/wp9f57eh/8/
[14:43:36] <robertmaxrees> err, you want to disallow?
[14:43:40] <robertmaxrees> what if somebody changes their mind?
[14:43:51] <christophe_v_e> Right.
[14:44:05] <robertmaxrees> errr....
[14:44:14] <christophe_v_e> Well, I was thinking an alert would come up - or just a message - saying they can't select another "for" before they changed their earlier vote
[14:44:41] <robertmaxrees> well, let's think about this - there a reason you're not defaulting to "abstention" for all fields?
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> and then setting the earliest of the three selections back to that default value?
[14:46:41] <christophe_v_e> Um, not really. It's just that the client wouldn't want any kind of "default" setting. He just says: make it max X votes... Which I have to interpret, knowing the client, as: don't set anything for other people, and make it so they can vote max 3x
[14:46:58] <christophe_v_e> or X times
[14:48:14] <christophe_v_e> But changing earlier votes and providing a message can work.
[14:49:02] <robertmaxrees> so they have to always vote, and make them go back and change?
[14:50:59] <christophe_v_e> I don't understand the question. The only limitation is that there is a maximum of votes really.
[14:51:06] <christophe_v_e> And they can only vote once.
[14:52:11] <robertmaxrees> so then make a decision :)
[14:52:37] <christophe_v_e> What are my options?
[14:52:41] <robertmaxrees> you can either "reset" the earliest of the three choices OR just give them a warning.
[14:53:40] <christophe_v_e> Just a warning will still process when the vote button is pressed, right?
[14:53:52] <robertmaxrees> you can prevent the button from being pressed, as well.
[14:54:07] <christophe_v_e> Alright, then we'll go for that option.
[14:54:23] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need the array.
[14:54:40] <christophe_v_e> Oh.
[14:54:59] <robertmaxrees> in fact, 90% of this isn't needed at this point.
[14:55:19] <robertmaxrees> this markup is terrible though.  yeesh.
[14:55:38] <christophe_v_e> Oh. Maybe we can just continue as we were ... as I really don't have the energy at this point to start a new script.
[14:55:48] <robertmaxrees> we're going to delete most of the code.
[14:56:17] <robertmaxrees> you still need the handler.  that's about it.  are you able to modify any of the HTML in this?
[14:56:54] <christophe_v_e> No, the HTML is generated by YOP Poll
[14:57:17] <jorisbuc> Hey, quick question, which CDN is faster and cached/used the most for latest JQuery: Google, MaxCDN or CDNJS?
[14:57:37] <robertmaxrees> jorisbuc probably google, but after the first hit it really won't matter.
[14:57:49] <jorisbuc> ok thank you
[14:57:57] <robertmaxrees> plus it's less than 100k, so i wouldn't worry about it.
[14:59:59] <snover> jorisbuc: if you want performance, don’t use a CDN
[15:02:01] <jorisbuc> @snover: I have my bundle served locally (in the process of being served in a CDN) but as Bootstrap and Jquery are already downloaded and cached in almost all my users I think I win some time
[15:02:08] <christophe_v_e> Ok, so we're keeping the handler. We can't modify the HTML
[15:03:03] <snover> jorisbuc: why do you think they are already downloaded and cached by all your users?
[15:04:02] <snover> i mean i can pretty much guarantee you that they aren’t, even at the peak of homogenous jquery library versioning (~1.4) less than 10% of sites used the same version
[15:04:08] <NoiseEee> (presumably they're bundled by "allMySitesJS.js" which wont help you - neither will the myriad versions of jquery in the wild)
[15:05:41] <jorisbuc> ok. So should my bundle include Jquery and bootstrap and be delivered from a CDN?
[15:06:04] <NoiseEee> meh
[15:06:17] <robertmaxrees> jorisbuc are you getting reports of site speed problems?
[15:06:23] <NoiseEee> is the extra DNS lookup worth it?  are your users truly coming from around the world?
[15:06:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:07:13] <jorisbuc> mostly US but a lot of them have bad connection so optimizing speed is important
[15:07:16] <snover> you are better off bundling the scripts your page needs into a single file and serving from the same domain as your html
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> jorisbuc then make sure you're minimizing and have compression enabled.
[15:07:51] <robertmaxrees> also make sure your images and compressed AND reduced in quality, as well as sized correctly.
[15:08:20] <snover> or tell your users to install Opera Max :)
[15:08:38] <jorisbuc> ok. I will tests these solutions. Thank you guys for your help
[15:12:32] <christophe_v_e> robertmaxrees: I'm willing to take the option we were working out if I can finish that tonight :$
[15:13:08] <robertmaxrees> you require a lot of hand holding...
[15:13:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm sort of surprised.
[15:14:41] <christophe_v_e> I'm sorry, up until now I've only had to use existing scripts. I plan on learning next summer vacation.
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> why not actually learn now, though?
[15:15:47] <christophe_v_e> I want to, but I don't know how to continue. Also it would be great if I could succeed in doing this before tomorrow.
[15:16:41] <robertmaxrees> then it's simple - on change, get a total of all candidates with a "for" vote - if there's more than 1, preventDefault() on the event and display your warning.
[15:18:09] <christophe_v_e> alright, thanks, I'll try to work it out.
[15:49:52] <jim_j> hi all
[15:50:11] <jim_j> is there a tool that shows how many jquery or js functions are running on a page?
[15:50:40] <robertmaxrees> wat
[15:50:47] <Zzaichik> not that I'm familiar with - that sounds unnecessary and weird.
[15:50:52] <robertmaxrees> why would you need that?
[15:52:26] <jim_j> robert, to check if too much is running on the client side
[15:52:32] <robertmaxrees> that's now how you check that.
[15:52:39] <robertmaxrees> and define "too much".
[15:52:43] <jim_j> how do you check it?
[15:52:47] <robertmaxrees> are you getting complaints of performance problems?
[15:53:22] <jim_j> robert, yep, someone wrote to me that they see 250,000 functions run everytime they access my site
[15:53:35] <robertmaxrees> the number of functions is almost entirely irrelevant.
[15:53:42] <arc_> : /
[15:53:43] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling this is closer to what you wanbt.
[15:54:00] <robertmaxrees> you want to profile your site and look for performance problems.
[15:54:28] <robertmaxrees> but just because somebody said they see 250,000 functions running means... nothing.
[15:54:41] <robertmaxrees> are they actually noticing problems?  does the site run poorly?
[15:54:42] <arc_> users
[15:54:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[15:54:56] <jim_j> robert, they're saying their browser crashes but I can't duplicate it
[15:54:58] <robertmaxrees> users are a weird bunch.
[15:55:13] <robertmaxrees> jim_j do you have the same browser/version/os as them?
[15:55:34] <jim_j> robert, I'm going to ask them what browser they are using
[15:55:41] <arc_> good idea
[15:55:47] <robertmaxrees> erm, you haven't done that?
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> then you have nothing to test.
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> you need the browser, which version of that browser, and which OS (specific enough to, say, windows 8 or windows 10)
[15:58:02] <jim_j> robert, yep, I'm going to send them a request.  btw, I'm looking at the cpu profiling link you sent also
[15:58:27] <robertmaxrees> only worry about it if you hear corroborated reports.
[15:58:41] <robertmaxrees> like, if there isn't an issue, don't go looking for one.
[15:59:07] <jim_j> thanks robert!   yes, that makes sense
[17:20:37] <claytonzaugg> How can I apply opacity to a black background that will work with ie8?  For example, I'm trying to do some modal work, but I'd like the background to have transparency and ie8 doesn't like my rgba
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/cross-browser-opacity/
[17:23:04] <claytonzaugg> I did that but it ends up making everything in the box opacity of .5 or whatever, I'd like to just apply that opacity to the background color when the modal pops up
[17:24:02] <robertmaxrees> generally your overlay would be a separate div at the end of the page just before the closing tag of body and it wouldn't contain anything else.
[17:28:00] <claytonzaugg> okay
[17:38:12] <kevireilly> claytonzaugg: a transparent png pixel for the background might also be an option
[17:38:44] <robertmaxrees> he shotgunned his question out to multiple channels - i'll let #css work with him ;)
[17:39:16] <kevireilly> ah
[17:42:34] <claytonzaugg> kevireilly, I'm trying to avoid that request is all.  I'm trying to clean up our code so it's producing less requests.  I had that image in there before, but now I'm trying to accomplish feats with css and jquery options instead.
[17:43:10] <kevireilly> not the best solution, but a data URI is an option for that aspect
[17:43:30] <claytonzaugg> okay
[17:43:47] <claytonzaugg> Thank you robertmaxrees and kevireilly for your time :)
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of a faux pas to shotgun questions out like that btw.
[17:45:51] <claytonzaugg> Technically yes, it's a css property I need help with and I did ask the CSS channel, but I'm manipulating said property through jquery, so I was also asking here.
[17:46:36] <robertmaxrees> "hey fyi this was uncool" "yeah i know but here's how i'm going to try to justify it" ;)
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> s'all good.
[17:46:44] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.
[17:47:55] <claytonzaugg> I've got nothing.  Being called out and called out again, nothing to say but you're right.  Now I'll move on and try to not feel awkward anymore about it.
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:50:00] <claytonzaugg> I faught the 'net, and the 'net won
[17:50:07] <claytonzaugg> :D
[18:03:38] <drei> Each input checkbox filters displays products by looking at the class names inside of any <article> eg. if Beans Palak and Undergraduate are ticked it currently displays three results (shows everything that has any of the two class names even though other class names exist as well). I want to only show the results ONLY if the two class names exist and nothing else (in this case should only show two results). See fiddle -  http://jsfidd
[18:03:45] <robertmaxrees> that... cut off.
[18:03:53] <drei> any help much appreciated
[18:04:08] <robertmaxrees> drei that cut off - last thing i saw was "http://jsfidd"
[18:04:21] <drei> http://jsfiddle.net/mzvNL/37/
[18:05:12] <drei> hope it makes sense
[18:05:28] <robertmaxrees> so you want it to be "and", not "or"?
[18:05:32] <drei> yes
[18:05:46] <robertmaxrees> so first off, you want the change event, not the click event.
[18:07:31] * drej glares at drei 
[18:07:49] <toothrot> he really needs help
[18:08:04] <drei> glare back drej
[18:08:05] <robertmaxrees> i don't think anybody disagreed?
[18:08:43] <drej> with what
[18:08:47] <drej> what are we disagreeing with
[18:08:49] <drej> i wanna argue!
[18:08:58] <drei> <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by change event, not the click event
[18:08:58] <drej> robertmaxrees: RETORT
[18:17:49] <robertmaxrees> drei ignoring the "post" class, right?
[18:18:06] <drei> yes
[18:20:45] <drei>  
[18:21:10] <drei> 'post' doesn't even need to be there if it can
[18:21:47] <robertmaxrees> okay - so where are you stuck?
[18:21:54] <robertmaxrees> (we're not going to hand you the answer :)
[18:22:28] <drei> 'and' not 'or'
[18:22:33] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:22:44] <robertmaxrees> so see how you're doing elements.each(function () { and then that .show() in there?
[18:22:48] <drei> leave 'post' there
[18:22:50] <robertmaxrees> you're not actually doing any comparing in there.
[18:24:06] <robertmaxrees> i'd build up an array of all selected checkbox IDs (those really should be values btw) and then check each post and see if all classes BUT post are in that array.
[18:25:01] <drei> thanks <robertmaxrees> will give that a try
[18:30:15] <drei> I'm stuck
[18:30:23] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[18:31:36] <drei> truth is I don't know where to start
[18:31:48] <robertmaxrees> okay, so step through what i said.
[18:33:07] <drei> it's shwoing anything with that id
[18:33:17] <drei> *showing
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> step through the suggestion i made.
[18:33:35] <robertmaxrees> build an array of all selected checkbox IDs - start here.
[18:36:35] <drei> not sure how
[18:37:01] <robertmaxrees> you can use jquery's .map() method.
[18:38:00] <drei> but we can't store the values
[18:38:05] <robertmaxrees> yes we can.
[18:38:30] <robertmaxrees> i literally just did all of this ;)
[18:38:32] <drei> because what if they want an extra checkbox
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic stuff.
[18:38:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[18:38:47] <drei> it's oik
[18:38:59] <robertmaxrees> this will literally work for any number of checkboxes.
[18:39:07] <drei> ok
[18:39:10] <robertmaxrees> it's entirely dynamic.
[18:39:34] <drei> great
[18:39:49] <drei> although I have no idea how
[18:40:01] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/map/
[18:40:13] <drei> yep, looking at that now
[18:40:24] <robertmaxrees> if you get stuck again, show us what you tried.
[18:40:43] <drei> thanks
[19:15:02] * drej glares at drei again

[19:22:03] <z1haze> great thanks
[20:04:01] <Vivekananda> viveka
[20:10:33] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, after looking into d3, its massive and highly complicated, why is this popular lol
[20:11:28] <robertmaxrees> it does everything you'd need a charting lib to do.
[20:11:37] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[20:12:23] <z1haze> pretty basic stuff; I only need to have a basic line/plot chart that shows a day of the week along the x axis and an integer along the y axis
[20:12:29] <snover> because web development is like high school
[20:12:56] <robertmaxrees> check out chart.js.
[20:12:58] <robertmaxrees> or search around.
[20:13:59] <z1haze> ah yea chart.js seems a lot more like what im after
[20:30:01] <z1haze> What would be the logic behind having a day of the week by my x axis labels, but always show the current day in the furthest right position
[20:30:24] <robertmaxrees> use moment.js.
[20:30:25] <z1haze> so for today it would read, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday, modnay.. because today is monday
[20:32:48] <z1haze> Sorry, I dont understand what thats going to do
[20:32:56] <robertmaxrees> make using dates much, much, much easier.
[20:33:22] <z1haze> Ok, but that wasnt what I was asking about, at least I dont think
[20:33:35] <robertmaxrees> nope, but it'll make doing it much easier.
[20:33:47] <robertmaxrees> the native Date() constructor is really confusing and hard to work with.
[20:33:52] <robertmaxrees> moment.js makes it much less so.
[20:34:32] <z1haze> alright, but as far as creating a chart where the or of days in the x axis is always the current day all the way to the right
[20:34:38] <z1haze> Is that possible?
[20:34:47] <robertmaxrees> why wouldn't it be?
[20:35:19] <z1haze> Not sure how to make the labels dynamic, remember you've helped me in the past, im kind sucky with this stuff
[20:35:29] <robertmaxrees> trying to teach you to fish ;)
[20:35:35] <z1haze> no i get it
[20:35:38] <z1haze> its helped
[20:35:42] <robertmaxrees> what data format does the charting library need?
[20:35:43] <z1haze> ive gotten a lot done in the last few weeks
[20:36:21] <z1haze> well, using chart.js the labels are just strings, and the data is just an array of integers
[20:36:46] <robertmaxrees> so then try./
[20:37:27] <robertmaxrees> this is why we have things like arrays - you can create an array of the names of today + the last 6 days, then forEach() through that and create those labels.
[20:38:41] <z1haze> end goal something like this: http://puu.sh/lNnq0/4622b1e7f4.png
[20:38:50] <robertmaxrees> that's great.
[20:39:03] <robertmaxrees> :) i already know what you want.  i'm trying to figure out where you're stuck.
[20:39:10] <z1haze> oh alright
[20:39:49] <z1haze> well im stuck in a few places, first place, i am stuck with setting the labels, however now I can probably do it with what you said.
[20:40:02] <robertmaxrees> right, so get the labels.
[20:40:11] <z1haze> Next im stuck with how do I ensure that all data points on the graph line up on the correct day
[20:40:20] <z1haze> but ok ill get the labels going
[20:40:26] <robertmaxrees> that depends entirely on the data you have.
[20:40:36] <robertmaxrees> and how you're going to tie everything together.
[20:40:41] <robertmaxrees> does the data you have contain this information?
[20:40:43] <z1haze> would moment.js do the days of the week like you suggested or just pure jquery
[20:40:51] <z1haze> they are all datetimes
[20:40:56] <robertmaxrees> in your data?
[20:41:06] <robertmaxrees> then you can easily get the day names using moment.
[20:41:07] <z1haze> it can have it sure
[20:41:14] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't handle dates.
[20:41:31] <z1haze> my rows just contain an id, an integer, then created and updated at fields that are timestamps
[20:41:55] <robertmaxrees> you should include the date each one is for, then.
[20:42:16] <z1haze> and how do I make it start where it belongs?
[20:42:33] <z1haze> like say..if you just start a graph today.. its going to have to plot all the way to the right
[20:42:42] <z1haze> how would it know where to begin
[20:43:23] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking way too far ahead, but you'll get the entry for today by finding the one whose date matches today's, then walk backwards from there.
[20:44:02] <robertmaxrees> like, the format of the data here is a big piece of the puzzle.
[20:44:11] <z1haze> ok guess ill figure out the labels first cause i dont think its as simple as i though
[20:44:29] <robertmaxrees> it's simple, but you're not breaking the problem down into its partds.
[20:45:25] <robertmaxrees> you're looking at it like it's a one-step thing.  break it down: "how do I get the last 7 days in javascript in chronological order?" and "how do I get the last 7 days' worth of data?"
[20:45:58] <z1haze> ican pull the data without issues i believe
[20:46:05] <z1haze> thats done in php and i understand that part xD
[20:46:14] <robertmaxrees> what format is the data in?
[20:46:45] <robertmaxrees> like, just an array of objects?
[20:47:28] <z1haze> can be whatever i want
[20:47:30] <z1haze> what would be best?
[20:47:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:48:09] <robertmaxrees> i'd do an array that's in chronological order whose objects contain, among everything else, a "dayOfWeek" property.
[20:48:09] <z1haze> it can be objects or just an associative array
[20:48:21] <robertmaxrees> in JS, those are one in the same btw.
[20:48:41] <robertmaxrees> you need a plain array in your JSON.
[20:48:46] <z1haze> well $row['field'] vs $object->field
[20:49:02] <robertmaxrees> that's PHP.
[20:49:06] <z1haze> i know
[20:49:08] <robertmaxrees> when those output to JSON, they look the same, right?
[20:49:18] <z1haze> probably i dont know
[20:49:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:49:27] <z1haze> ill take your word on it
[20:49:30] <robertmaxrees> you want a true array, not an associative array.
[20:49:55] <drei> <robertmaxrees> something like this - http://jsfiddle.net/aFdGt/3/
[20:50:06] <z1haze> alright igot my chart stuff and moment js pulled in
[20:50:14] <robertmaxrees> drei woah what
[20:50:16] <z1haze> bbs gonna get the days of the week
[20:50:33] <robertmaxrees> this is different from what you had earlier.
[20:50:39] <robertmaxrees> why do people change their questions like that?
[20:51:11] <drei> yes, it's an example I found that uses .map()
[20:51:18] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:51:23] <robertmaxrees> that's not the way you want to do that.
[20:51:39] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, suggest I use moment.js to get my days of week or just javascript?
[20:51:45] <z1haze> I have an idea how id do it with js
[20:51:59] <drei> if you show me I will lean something new today
[20:52:02] <robertmaxrees> z1haze i suggest you do all of your calculations server-side.
[20:52:17] <z1haze> oh, ok np
[20:52:20] <drei> looking at the api I can't understand it as it's not incontext
[20:52:25] <drei> *context
[20:52:37] <robertmaxrees> i hate that.
[20:52:46] <robertmaxrees> what was your original fiddle?
[20:53:19] <drei> http://jsfiddle.net/mzvNL/37/
[20:53:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mzvNL/39/
[20:53:58] <robertmaxrees> filter and map.
[20:54:08] <robertmaxrees> the idea with .map() is to transform from one format to another.
[20:54:33] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.  i gotta dash.
[20:54:34] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[20:55:51] <drei> thank you so much <robertmaxrees>
[20:55:58] <drei> absolute legend

[21:26:05] <dev_> Hi, Im trying to add a flexbox with several flex items, that appear once you press a button, through using the jQuery after function
[21:27:07] <dev_> How do I go about doing this? Im confused on where to put the flexbox code
[21:27:18] <dev_> the html
[21:31:34] <ankk> hi.
[21:31:35] <ankk> $(this).parents("tr:first").css('background-color', background);
[21:31:48] <ankk> i am trying to change tr background color with this and i am.
[21:32:00] <ankk> but it doesn't change background color if it has a color already
[21:32:21] <ankk> how can i assign color if it has already?
[21:43:52] <ankk> $("input:checkbox").parents("tr:first").addClass('checkedBolum');
[21:43:58] <ankk> what is wrong with this?
[22:32:21] <alturic> If I wanted to have an image swap when a button was hovered, and when the mouse left stay on that image... but if a button was clicked, and then a different button was hovered and when mouse left went back to the clicked image... would I need if statements, and/or multiple functions? One where the hover is first, and one where the click is first?
[22:33:18] <alturic> Actually, the hover is technically always first, unless you do things like hoverintent, etc which I'm not.
[22:33:44] <alturic> hover being mouseover in my current setup. Guess it would help using the proper event names.
[23:05:33] <ankk> $("input.oddBolum:checkbox").prop('checked', $(this).prop("checked"));
[23:05:37] <ankk> anything wrong here?
[23:20:29] <alturic> ugh, if I set a variable in mouseover and on click  $('#button').on({ mouseover: function(){...},click: function(){...},mouseleave: function(){...} })  so I can use it in mouseleave, how can I make the click variable take precendence over the hover variable?
[23:21:46] <alturic> I don't want to actuall unset any of the variables because if click was performed I want that to be what mouseleave uses. if the click wasn't performed obviously I don't have a problem.
