[01:48:19] <acidjazz> FirewalkR: just swap classes
[01:48:27] <acidjazz> have an .on and a .off
[01:48:33] <acidjazz> display none and display block
[01:48:49] <acidjazz> $(table1).addClass('on').removeClass('off');
[01:48:51] <acidjazz> and vice versa
[02:15:57] <rollingWolf> acidjazz, or just hide()/show()?
[02:55:11] <acidjazz> well yea but thats a bit messy
[02:55:28] <acidjazz> applying direct styles and having less control
[05:23:01] <momomo> What is the best way to detect a space bar keyup event, and act on it ( play/pause video ) unless the space is an input field or similar ?
[05:23:07] <momomo> should I bind on document, window, body or ... ? \
[12:25:57] <sayan__> Hi! newbie here, looking to join the Jquery organisation
[12:27:23] <sayan__> I would like to contribute to the organisation.
[12:27:42] <sayan__> Looking for details to move forward :)
[14:52:39] <stonemanherod> I have inpu text with id="color" and trying to change value with: $('#color').val(color); Why this don't work?
[15:30:09] <joaocastanho> hi
[15:30:26] <joaocastanho> Do you guys know some plugin I can use to guide users through a form?
[16:15:26] <plamb> did i see somewhere you can use dot notation for a jquery objects html attributes
[16:20:44] <plamb> you cant use .is to compare strings?
[16:22:36] <shoky> you don't use jquery to compare strings
[16:41:48] <plamb> if i create a new var like
[16:42:00] <plamb> currentPrice = $('h3').text()
[16:42:07] <plamb> can i update that .text()
[16:42:09] <plamb> like
[16:42:15] <plamb> currentPrice = '3'; ?
[16:51:51] <shoky> no
[16:52:03] <plamb> damn
[16:52:27] <plamb> can you declare that a parameter passed into a function will be a jQuery object
[16:52:33] <plamb> and therefore get the jQuery methods
[16:52:40] <plamb> (im used to static typing sorry)
[16:53:28] <shoky> no, you can wrap stuff in a jquery object with $(...)  but that's really only useful for selectors and dom elements
[16:53:42] <plamb> is there anyway to update this
[16:53:42] <plamb> currentPrice = $('h3').text()
[16:53:45] <plamb> later in the code?
[16:53:46] <plamb> or no
[16:53:54] <plamb> i guess not since its not a jquery obj
[16:54:16] <shoky> var currentPrice = $('h3');    currentPrice.text()...   currentPrice.text('foo')   etc
[16:54:42] <shoky> $() returns a jquery object,   .text()  returns a plain string
[16:55:01] <shoky> .text() called as a getter, that is
[16:55:37] <plamb> okay let me create an example
[16:58:02] <plamb> tell me what im doign wrong here shoky
[16:58:03] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/LpmeL18u/
[16:58:11] <plamb> in the function UpdatePrice
[16:58:21] <plamb> $(initialPrice).text() returns empty
[16:58:26] <plamb> in a console.log
[16:58:37] <plamb> oh wait a second
[16:58:48] <plamb> did i write the currentPrice variable wrong
[16:59:13] <shoky> is that your question?
[16:59:51] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/LpmeL18u/3/
[16:59:59] <plamb> why am i getting back $NaN120
[17:01:15] <plamb> substring(1) doesnt appear to be stripping the first char
[17:02:09] <plamb> console.log($(initialPrice).text().substring(1));
[17:02:10] <shoky> it is, but there is more than one whitespace char
[17:02:17] <plamb> ??
[17:02:19] <shoky> use .trim()
[17:02:26] <plamb> so .trim().substring(1)
[17:02:27] <plamb> ?
[17:02:36] <shoky> your h3 content has  newline as first char
[17:02:41] <shoky> yes
[17:02:52] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/LpmeL18u/4/
[17:02:53] <plamb> bleh
[17:02:56] <plamb> still not stripping it
[17:03:11] <shoky> you didn't use .trim()
[17:03:15] <shoky> only in the console.log
[17:03:37] <plamb> OH
[17:03:39] <shoky> slow down ;)
[17:03:44] <plamb> my console isnt refreshing
[17:03:46] <plamb> just appending
[17:03:47] <plamb> lol
[17:03:57] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/LpmeL18u/5/
[17:04:04] <shoky> because the page is not refreshing
[17:04:07] <plamb> so how do i get the floats to add the way i want to
[17:04:48] <shoky> toFixed  returns a string
[17:04:55] <shoky> not a number
[17:04:56] <plamb> hmm
[17:05:05] <plamb> how do i return 0.00 as a decimaled number
[17:05:09] <shoky> Number(...)
[17:05:20] <plamb> and that will handle the decimal ?
[17:05:30] <shoky> oh
[17:05:45] <shoky> use .toFixed only at the end after you do any calculations
[17:05:55] <shoky> do the calculations on numbers
[17:06:05] <plamb> so i should use parseFloat then .toFixed later
[17:06:27] <shoky> ya
[17:08:30] <plamb> tfw this works in fiddle
[17:08:31] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/LpmeL18u/6/
[17:08:34] <plamb> and not in my code lol
[17:09:07] <shoky> you got currentPrice on first line btw
[17:09:13] <shoky> instead of $currentPrice
[17:09:32] <plamb> ohhh
[17:09:36] <plamb> forgot i changed that lol
