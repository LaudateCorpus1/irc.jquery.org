[07:51:29] <dimi1947> I am tryingg to get the text of some a element which a re inside li but I cannot https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/j47xw2u0/8/
[08:15:06] <Robdgreat> dimi1947: any identifiers with a space between are expected to be nested. for an element with multiple classes you want to put the class identifiers together like .class1.class2
[08:15:46] <Robdgreat> or .class1.class2.class3
[08:46:17] <Robdgreat> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[08:46:24] <Robdgreat> well, I tried
[08:52:03] <jak2000> hi
[09:11:34] <dimi1947> Robdgreat:thx
[09:11:49] <Robdgreat> np
[09:21:56] <dimi1947> using text() I have ggotten all the text contained in a attribute contained in li of an unordered ul...I must pass all these now to an array.....here is the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/afgtjdw2/18/...i tried to use .toArray() without result..take a look at the omment in jjs pane
[09:26:16] <shoky_> dimi1947: you can use .map() and .get()   https://jsfiddle.net/70cysbo4/
[09:26:46] <shoky_> (or you could .split() the full text)
[09:27:17] <Robdgreat> thanks for that, shoky_ that helped me too :)
[09:27:48] <Robdgreat> in the past I've used .each and a cumbersome function
[09:31:11] <dimi1947> shoky:computers are magic...there is no doubt about that..thanks
[11:53:00] <jak2000> hi
[11:53:11] <jak2000> arghh, can i ask a css/html5 question here?
[12:13:18] <Robdgreat> if it involves jquery, of course :D
[12:13:42] <Robdgreat> all jquery questions are welcome
[12:23:26] <jak2020> Robdgreat: yes why not: How to resize an image between <a></a> (link image)?     with jquery of course
[12:27:43] <robertmaxrees> jak2020 that's a really broad question.
[12:34:00] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 it's good if you can show us an example of what you want.
[12:35:53] <jak2000> ok. build a fiddle
[12:36:09] <robertmaxrees> or is this related to what you asked yesterday?
[12:36:51] <jak2000> so so,  but continue....
[12:36:56] <jak2000> wait a moment build the fiddle
[12:56:32] <jak2020> thanks friends solved with css
[12:56:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> so you tried to do it yourself and figured it out? :)
[12:56:54] <jak2020> yes
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> life lessons ;)
[13:22:35] * thiras[m] sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/ziiiWsagentyoZpMsiPRsIyQ/message.txt >
[13:22:50] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] paste code into jsfiddle.
[13:22:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:22:59] <robertmaxrees> make a test case
[13:25:16] <JJ15> Can data attributes be used to store state?
[13:25:39] <robertmaxrees> JJ15 they can be used to store whatever data you'd like.
[13:26:25] <thiras[m]> https://jsfiddle.net/98hsb1dn/
[13:26:25] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] for starters: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w67xcsqo/
[13:26:29] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:26:30] <JJ15> Is it a good practice to use the attributes to store state?
[13:26:42] <robertmaxrees> JJ15 it really depends.  what are you building?
[13:27:28] <thiras[m]> you can ignore `shipping` and `recipient` each loops. they are working quite well. the problem is `// add item` loop
[13:27:45] <thiras[m]> the example doesn't cover those because the form is quite long
[13:28:24] <robertmaxrees> erm, so wait.
[13:28:58] <JJ15> Landing pages. But they're interactive and change depending on various state changes. I just thought it would be a cool idea to store state there instead of in an array/object.
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue exactly?  that push isn't adding what you're expecting thiras[m]
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> JJ15 yeah, it really depends on how much "state" you're talking about.  if it's, like, minimal, sure?  sometimes you just want to add/remove classes instead.
[13:31:12] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] i'm going to guess your issue is that you keep using .children() when things are direct descendents.
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] use .find() instead.
[13:31:29] <thiras[m]> robertmaxrees: yes i suspect that too
[13:31:37] <thiras[m]> ok thanks trying right now
[13:33:06] <thiras[m]> you are totally right. is that problem occurred because of each in each
[13:33:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah so second issue - why are you doing an each in an each? :)
[13:33:33] <thiras[m]> or because the structure of children? other each loops with children are working fine
[13:33:50] <thiras[m]> robertmaxrees: because i have multipe items there
[13:33:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:34:11] <robertmaxrees> .children() only goes to direct descentends.  those inputs are a few levels deeper.
[13:34:26] <robertmaxrees> avoid using .children() and default to .find().  problem solved.
[13:34:34] <thiras[m]> got it. thank youu
[13:35:19] <robertmaxrees> also: i would experiment with jquery's .map() for cases where you're trying to make an array.
[13:57:45] <JJ15> robertmaxrees, yeah that's what I currently do. Toggle classes etc. Thanks for the discussion :)
[13:57:57] <JJ15> Oh he's gone.
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> back
[13:58:09] <JJ15> wb
[13:58:32] <robertmaxrees> if it's a bunch of boolean-type checks, then classes are more than OK.
[17:09:30] <thiras[m]> hello again. what is the easiest way to convert checkbox "on/off" values with boolean for a nested (not just one level but many levels with arrays) json
[17:09:45] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] that question doesn't really make sense.
[17:11:02] <robertmaxrees> for instance: is it just a JS object or actually JSON? (json != javascript fwiw) also, how does that data correspond to the markup?
[17:12:26] <thiras[m]> it's a js object I've created with lots of each loops. And I'm converting it to a JSON to POST it. I've tried json.stringify's replacer function but seems it doesn't work with the nested jsons (some levels has array in it)
[17:12:51] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to represent the checkboxes as boolans?
[17:12:52] <thiras[m]> (i don't know if problem is array or nesting itself for replacer function)
[17:12:55] <robertmaxrees> *booleans
[17:13:02] <thiras[m]> exactly
[17:13:11] <robertmaxrees> and what's a "replacer function"?  can you show what you're doing in a fiddle?
[17:13:28] <robertmaxrees> because you can JSON.stringify() on any valid JS object.
[17:13:47] <robertmaxrees> well, almost any.  there are catches, but you likely aren't running into those.
[17:14:09] <thiras[m]> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#the_replacer_parameter this is the reference of replacer
[17:14:12] <thiras[m]> my function is coming
[17:15:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaah that's what you're talking about.
[17:15:39] <thiras[m]> https://jsfiddle.net/57qumec0/1/
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need the replacer in this case.
[17:16:18] <robertmaxrees> if you're generating the object, just generate it with the booleans in the first place.
[17:16:44] <thiras[m]> yeah i know that but ihave lots of loops
[17:16:47] <thiras[m]> that's quite sad
[17:16:52] <robertmaxrees> show me the loops.
[17:17:04] <robertmaxrees> using looks shouldn't change much in this case.
[17:17:28] <robertmaxrees> since using a loop doesn't impact how you read the value of a checkbox.
[17:17:37] <robertmaxrees> or state, rather.
[17:18:16] <thiras[m]> https://jsfiddle.net/we4aosjt/
[17:18:27] <robertmaxrees> and the html??
[17:18:37] <thiras[m]> does it matter?
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> also: is there a reason you aren't using .serialize() here?
[17:19:06] <thiras[m]> yes i wasn't aware what that is
[17:19:11] <thiras[m]> let me check
[17:19:46] <robertmaxrees> you have https://api.jquery.com/serialize/ and https://api.jquery.com/serializearray/ available.
[17:20:00] <thiras[m]> thank i'm on it
[17:20:11] <robertmaxrees> if that's not able to get you what you need, there are other ways to do what you're doing without nesting loops and the like.
[17:20:13] <thiras[m]> does .serilizer handles with the checkboxes and bools?
[17:20:27] <thiras[m]> handle*
[17:20:37] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: i would read the docs and test it out.
[17:20:53] <chazy> hi, is it possible to detect which of an input type number buttons is pressed?
[17:21:12] <chazy> the up and down arrows that increase/decrease the value
[17:21:16] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] if those won't do what you need, i would rethink your strategy either way since you're coding yourself into a corner :)
[17:21:32] <robertmaxrees> chazy are you asking about input type="number"??
[17:21:39] <chazy> yes
[17:21:48] <robertmaxrees> chazy there are ways to detect that, sure.
[17:22:18] <thiras[m]> robertmaxrees: according to official docs example it doesn't handle them as bool too
[17:22:22] <robertmaxrees> chazy though your logic shouldn't rely on knowing if you're going up or down.
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] is just says it doesn't include them if they aren't checked i thought.
[17:22:52] <chazy> robertmaxrees: it's just for UX, where a user increases or decreases a value and it's automatically changed server side
[17:23:21] <chazy> but i need to know which was clicked
[17:23:23] <robertmaxrees> chazy then detect the change and input events.  done.
[17:23:38] <robertmaxrees> chazy you should be sending the value of the checkbox, not whether it went up or down.
[17:23:56] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ygjuex9L/
[17:23:57] <thiras[m]> yes exactly. and when they are checked they return the value given as `&radio=radio1`
[17:24:13] <chazy> i'm already using blur and enter in case they want to input a value, instead of +1 or -1
[17:24:37] <robertmaxrees> thiras[m] if you need something more fleshed out than that, you'll want to change how you're building that object and check if the input is type="checkbox".
[17:24:40] <robertmaxrees> pretty straightforward :)
[17:24:55] <thiras[m]> yes i guess it's my only choice
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> chazy so then when the handler fires, send the value to the server :)
[17:25:39] <chazy> im already sending the value they input, but i also wanna make possible to just increase or decrease by 1 on click
[17:26:17] <chazy> i need to know which button triggers the change/input
[17:26:30] <robertmaxrees> chazy then use the input event.
[17:26:34] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1u5vjphd/
[17:26:56] <chazy> but that would conflict when they manually input, if they wanna input more than 1 digit it won't work
[17:27:20] <robertmaxrees> chazy sounds like you need to add a debounce.
[17:27:51] <robertmaxrees> and flesh out canceling requests as the user enters more inforamtion :)
[17:34:31] <chazy> what if i just detect whether the input/change was triggered by keyboard or mouse?
[17:34:50] <chazy> on input how do i check whether it was keyboard or mouse?
[17:35:17] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> use a debounce and cancel requests.
[17:38:31] <chazy> idk what that is, can you provide a link?
