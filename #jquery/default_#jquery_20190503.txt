[01:56:46] <vitof> hey all
[06:26:50] <learner> hi, i want to parse json files/text with jq. is there a quickstart guide?
[06:35:28] <thykka> learner, you don't need jQuery for that; JSON.parse('YOURJSONSTRING')
[06:35:48] <thykka> learner, there's this, but it's deprecated http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[06:49:09] <learner> i misspose. sorry.. i ment i have json string. and i have jq. i want to get city name from {"results":[{"location":{"street":"2605 e north st","city":"dubbo","s for example. i dont know how to access it
[06:49:52] <learner> thykka
[06:50:35] <thykka> learner, you first parse the JSON string with JSON.parse, then access the data like you would access any javascript object/array
[06:50:51] <learner> i dont know how to do it
[06:51:00] <thykka> what part about it is causing trouble?
[06:51:12] <thykka> googling?
[06:51:17] <learner> i tryed results.[].location.city but i get an error
[06:51:24] <thykka> did you parse the JSON first?
[06:51:30] <learner> yes
[06:51:46] <thykka> also, it would be results[0].location.city
[06:53:06] <learner> it returns null
[06:53:19] <thykka> then there's something wrong somewhere
[06:54:07] <thykka> learner, seem to be fine here https://jsfiddle.net/p1r84dxt/
[06:54:34] <learner> i think i got it... forgot a dont... brain fart. sorry
[06:54:39] <learner> dot*
[07:08:28] <Cork> learner: a side note, if you get the json from a resource url, you should normally not need to do parseJSON on it
[07:08:46] <Cork> cause as long as the server is configured correctly it should be parsed automatically by jquery
[11:59:13] <\monster\> Hey guys, is there a quick method to convert a jquery object which contains a select node with selected value into html and retain the selected value?  .prop('outerHTML') will create the html of the select node but does not retain the selected value
[11:59:40] <robertmaxrees> can we ask why you need to turn into "html"?
[12:00:44] <\monster\> crap brb looks like im running outdated/insecure mirc ..brb
[12:00:53] <robertmaxrees> okay....
[12:07:18] <\monster\> ok back to the object to html question, so there's no quick way to generate html and retain any values set in the jquery object?
[12:07:39] <robertmaxrees> i'm wondering if there's a better way to accomplish your end goal, hence my question :)
[12:09:11] <\monster\> Well, I'm creating some html manually and wanted to simply do ${foo.prop('outerHTML')} within the big block of html.  I can always do append to the block later on if there's no quick way of doing what I wanted
[12:10:02] <robertmaxrees> i don't see how that relates back to your question.
[12:10:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to clone the element and retain the selections?
[12:12:41] <\monster\> To put things simply yes, I'm cloning a select multiple times, setting value as needed, then I want to insert the cloned ones into a bigger block of html
[12:12:54] <robertmaxrees> there's an easy way to do that.
[12:13:07] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/clone/#clone-withDataAndEvents
[12:13:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:13:24] <robertmaxrees> .clone(true) or .clone(true, true) will get you what you need.
[12:13:36] <\monster\> ah yes I saw that, not sure why i ignored it hmmmm
[12:15:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:17:27] <\monster\> oh wait now I know why, I'm cloning an empty select that acts as a source, I'm setting value after it's closed and then I want to turn it into html
[12:17:52] <robertmaxrees> heh, so that doesn't explain why you want to "turn it into html".
[12:18:03] <robertmaxrees> just worry about the DOM, y'know?
[12:18:59] <\monster\> because I can't do  `<div>${jqueryObject}</div>`
[12:19:21] <robertmaxrees> correct.  why would you want to do that though?
[12:19:29] <robertmaxrees> why can't you just clone the element and then append it.
[12:19:49] <robertmaxrees> that's where i'm lost - why not just .append() the element or whatever.
[12:22:09] <\monster\> It's a big block of html and the spot I want to insert to is deep in it not at the end.  I realize I can add some ID to the spot I want it at and do append after, but I wanted to see if there's a way to do it at the same time inside the template string
[12:22:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's no reason to do it within a template string like that imo.
[12:22:48] <robertmaxrees> you can also traverse the DOM other ways, not just using IDs.
[12:23:32] <\monster\> back to my original question, so there's no way to generate html from the object and retain the selected values?
[12:23:41] <\monster\> not looking for other ways to do it, I'm aware of them
[12:23:43] <robertmaxrees> if you want to retain form control states, there's no "simple" way to get that over into your html because the html never really gets updated.
[12:23:49] <robertmaxrees> the DOM does.
[12:23:53] <\monster\> ya ok :(
[12:24:00] <\monster\> oh well
[12:24:08] <robertmaxrees> .append() is your friend :)
[12:47:32] <codecutter> any examples on how to use sse with jquery?
[12:47:51] <robertmaxrees> sse?
[12:47:56] <codecutter> i think i have the server end all setup, what do i need to do on the client side?
[12:48:01] <codecutter> server sent events
[12:48:10] <codecutter> google it
[12:48:17] <codecutter> if you don't know wnat it means
[12:48:28] <codecutter> bruh
[12:48:32] <robertmaxrees> oh - jquery wouldn't really work with those.
[12:48:43] <codecutter> hmmm
[12:48:59] <robertmaxrees> you'd need a plugin
[12:49:33] <codecutter> links? name?
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> google it ;)
[12:49:56] <codecutter> nvm
[12:49:58] <codecutter> found it
[12:50:04] <codecutter> first result
[12:50:07] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://github.com/jquery/jquery/search?q=EventSource&unscoped_q=EventSource
[12:50:12] <robertmaxrees> nothing jquery core to handle it.
[12:50:32] <robertmaxrees> dunno why you'd even want to use jquery to handle them.  native interface looks preetty simple.
[13:07:40] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: yea, appears so...
[13:07:43] <codecutter> thanks
[13:07:46] <robertmaxrees> sure
[19:05:25] <yolan> hello
[19:05:39] <robertmaxrees> http://www.nohello.com/ :)
[19:05:43] <robertmaxrees> how can we help you?
[19:06:28] <yolan> What happen to a div when I say div.toggle()
[19:06:35] <yolan> it gets hidden / shown
[19:06:44] <yolan> but how can I detect the state of this div?
[19:06:49] <yolan> Please :Ã 
[19:06:51] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[19:07:00] <yolan> Thanks you robertmaxrees, always there lol
[19:07:50] <yolan> robertmaxrees, nothing yet, I am trying to understand first how toggle() work behind the scene to think of a solution after
[19:08:03] <yolan> and I'm not very proficient yet, so learning on the go
[19:08:06] <robertmaxrees> have you tried inspecting the element to see?
[19:09:20] <yolan> I don't have the reflexe yet sorry lol
[19:09:25] <yolan> So ok
[19:09:30] <yolan> it adds display : none
[19:09:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:09:55] <robertmaxrees> not always though.
[19:10:03] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ -> "The matched elements will be revealed or hidden immediately, with no animation, by changing the CSS display property. If the element is initially displayed, it will be hidden; if hidden, it will be shown. The display property is saved and restored as needed. If an element has a display value of inline, then is hidden and shown, it will once again be displayed
[19:10:03] <robertmaxrees> inline."
[19:10:10] <robertmaxrees> the docs tell you everything you need to know :)
[19:10:39] <yolan> Better to check it out then :) Thank you so much
[19:11:07] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[19:12:15] <yolan> are you one a developer of the project?
[19:12:22] <robertmaxrees> of jquery?
[19:12:25] <yolan> yes
[19:12:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:12:51] <yolan> because I see you here everyday, you work for them or are you a volunteer?
[19:12:59] <robertmaxrees> volunteer :)
[19:13:09] <yolan> You're doing god's work man :)
[19:13:19] <yolan> Stay awesome !
[19:13:21] <robertmaxrees> i got a lot of use out of the library for years.  this was my way to pay that back.
[19:13:29] <robertmaxrees> thanks. i appreciate it!
[19:13:49] <yolan> Yes, give back what you took, works well generaly in life :)
[19:14:09] <robertmaxrees> plus it helps me stay fresh and learn new things.
[21:25:27] <yolan> How can I add an eventListener to 2 element at the same time?
[21:25:49] <yolan> I tried el1,el2.on("change", function() { ... } });
[21:25:58] <yolan> but yes, I don't think it's like that
