[01:06:48] <poppiez> I have an element with a some content in it. this content can vary at all times. my container is 100x100 pixels. is there any way to calculate how much space my element needs and I way to structure it in equal parts that fits into the container. e.g. let's say my element needs 400x400 I could then split it into 4 100x100 containers
[01:07:15] <poppiez> hard to explain, bear with me
