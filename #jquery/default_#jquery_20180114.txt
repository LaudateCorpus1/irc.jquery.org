[01:06:54] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[02:01:51] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/t9vkddfm/43/ i am using jquery datatable here
[02:02:01] <hellyeah> but i got some error when you click button
[02:02:09] <hellyeah> can you take a look what problem can be
[02:02:44] <robertmaxrees> did you do what the alert tells you to do?
[02:03:18] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/manual/tech-notes/4
[02:09:42] <hellyeah> i understand the warning
[02:11:11] <hellyeah> hmm
[02:11:27] <hellyeah> i am not sure how to fix that error
[02:11:38] <hellyeah> because in jquery datable page use [[]]
[02:11:42] <hellyeah> i am using [{}]
[02:15:00] <hellyeah> okey
[02:15:04] <hellyeah> well i have null data
[02:15:13] <hellyeah> and datatables get along with null
[02:15:23] <hellyeah> but it is inevitable i can have null value
[02:16:26] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[02:16:36] <robertmaxrees> so datatables expects one thing and you give it another?
[02:22:14] <hellyeah> the web site said it doesn accept null values
[02:24:50] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[02:24:59] <robertmaxrees> and you have nulls, right?
[02:25:15] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think the fix is?
[02:25:21] <Woet> am i the only one concerned that hellyeah is dealing with medical information?
[02:26:05] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[02:26:43] <hellyeah> hmm
[02:26:49] <hellyeah> well
[02:28:38] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah if datatables doesn't accept null, but you're feeding it null....
[02:28:46] <robertmaxrees> one of those two things will have to change
[02:31:33] <hellyeah> there must be something for null values
[02:33:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:34:39] <hellyeah> there is smt       "defaultContent": ""
[02:36:53] <hellyeah> found this https://datatables.net/reference/option/columns.defaultContent
[02:37:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[02:38:28] <hellyeah> i guess this doesnt suit my need
[02:40:00] <robertmaxrees> so do some extra research.
[02:40:11] <robertmaxrees> figure out how to fulfill the need of the api that datatables offers?
[02:41:49] <hellyeah> datawell i guess i will do it later
[02:42:56] <hellyeah> i have some other businesses take care of
[02:43:36] <hellyeah> i am gonna write datatables forum
[02:46:14] <hellyeah> my boss wanted me to learn abou block chain
[02:46:49] * Woet blinks
[02:50:33] <hellyeah> Woet, man i dont know who you are but we should work together in a blinks project whatever hell it is
[03:08:00] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[06:09:08] <Northwoods>  ob['#fileuploader_1'] = new Array();
[06:09:08] <Northwoods>        ob['#fileuploader_1'].push(data); how do i unset(ob['#fileuploader_1'])
[06:09:35] <robertmaxrees> "unset"?
[06:09:46] <Northwoods> if i have to unset this  ob['#fileuploader_1']  only , i have other  ob['#fileuploader_2'], ob['#fileuploader_3'] etc
[06:09:56] <robertmaxrees> define "unset"
[06:10:13] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, i mean just remove this ob array index
[06:10:39] <robertmaxrees> erm
[06:10:53] <Northwoods> i have to completely remove #fileuploader_1 from ob array , completely
[06:10:54] <robertmaxrees> you mean the array at ob['#fileuploader_1']?
[06:11:01] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, correct
[06:11:03] <robertmaxrees> "ob array" isn weird
[06:11:05] <robertmaxrees> *is
[06:11:09] <robertmaxrees> ob is an object.
[06:11:13] <robertmaxrees> not an array.
[06:11:16] <Northwoods> ok
[06:11:34] <Northwoods> how do i remove object with this #fileuploader_1
[06:11:39] <robertmaxrees> you can set it to null or undefined, or you can delete it, but i might rethink what you're doing.
[06:11:44] <robertmaxrees> because something seems off.
[06:12:24] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, i know it doesn't seem to be correct to me also
[06:12:31] <Northwoods> but can't think of anything else at moment
[06:12:37] <robertmaxrees> why are you trying to delete a property?
[06:13:13] <Northwoods> i initialize serveral uploaders elements on single page dynamically and then add more than 1 pic to each , just to keep track of each uploaders pics , i have to do this
[06:13:30] <robertmaxrees> but why?
[06:13:33] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, when we remove the uploader element , i have to remove its saved values
[06:13:52] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, because images are uploaded through ajax
[06:14:07] <robertmaxrees> why not just grab the stuff you need when you actually need them instead of holding state in that object to begin with?
[06:14:15] <Northwoods> and i have to save the returned name ( data from ajax )
[06:14:17] <robertmaxrees> just wait until submit to grab thove value.
[06:14:21] <robertmaxrees> *values
[06:14:47] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, how do i save the returned ajax data from each uploader
[06:15:00] <robertmaxrees> what is an "uploader"?
[06:15:06] <robertmaxrees> and why do you need to save the data?
[06:15:08] <Northwoods> i mean how do i keep track that , this pictures belong to uploader #fileuploader_2 , for instance
[06:15:15] <Northwoods> ok let me upload code
[06:15:28] <robertmaxrees> well.
[06:15:33] <robertmaxrees> deferreds can do that.
[06:16:05] <robertmaxrees> var upload2 = $.ajax(); upload2.then(function() { console.log('upload2 finished') });
[06:17:17] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/d7w8hfwp/
[06:17:49] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, the uploader is added dynamicall
[06:17:58] <Northwoods> dynamically on the go
[06:18:02] <robertmaxrees> var newTextBoxDiv = $(document.createElement('div')) - you know this can just be var newTextBoxDiv = $('<div>') right?
[06:18:16] <robertmaxrees> and the dynamicism doesn't change what I just mentioned about deferreds
[06:20:33] <Northwoods> robertmaxrees, sorry i am not too proficient in javascript
[06:20:53] <robertmaxrees> so what are you actually trying to accomplish here?
[06:22:50] <Northwoods_> robertbo[m], is this incorrect , ob['#fileuploader_1'] = new Array(); ?
[06:23:11] <robertmaxrees> why are you making it an array?
[06:23:16] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use new Array();
[06:23:48] <Northwoods_> ob['abc']= {} ;  ??
[06:23:54] <robertmaxrees> ...
[06:24:00] <robertmaxrees> why do you need it to be an array?
[06:24:03] <robertmaxrees> or an object?
[06:24:09] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish?
[06:24:23] <robertmaxrees> also: {} and arrays are different.
[06:25:07] <Northwoods_> robertmaxrees, ok thanks for your help, i think i have to read more documentation
[06:25:12] <robertmaxrees> ...
[06:25:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[06:25:18] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[06:25:22] <robertmaxrees> {} is an object fwiw.
[06:25:27] <robertmaxrees> [] is for arrays.

[17:08:23] <devi8> Can I place a jquery function in a "data-func" attribute of a markup element to be evaluated later?
[17:39:36] <bolovanos> hithere
[17:40:24] <bolovanos> I have "<input type="text" id="message"></input>" (without form) I am servicing it with jquery, but I am missign history https://i.stack.imgur.com/K00g1.png - it is not building up
[17:40:55] <bolovanos> is it possible to insert text value wit jquery for future use?
[17:49:21] <devi8> sounds like you want an autocomplete field?
[17:59:51] <bolovanos> devi8, probably yes :)
[18:01:16] <devi8> There are tons of jquery solutions for auto-complete form fields .https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[18:02:39] <boxingoreos> Hi, I'm using loading a list from an SQL DB via Php into a jquery mobile listview.  I have it so you can edit the attributes of this list as well as add things to it.  The problem I am having is that unless I click my browsers refresh button I cannot see the changes in the listview.  How do I get listview to reflect these changes?
[18:03:31] <boxingoreos> Furthermore, I have a popup off each item in the listview to bring up editing.  The items are updated in the popups... but listview will not update.  Is there a function or option I should be changing?
[18:03:36] <boxingoreos> Or an alternate method
[18:03:56] <devi8> Is the database being updated?
[18:04:28] <bolovanos> devi8, my bad - I have seen this while searching for solution, but in my opinion it is to "heavy" solution, I was wondering if there is funcitonality simillar to one where <input> is surrounded with <form>
[18:04:35] <boxingoreos> Yes it is
[18:05:40] <boxingoreos> It seems to be purely related to how listview is handled... since the popups that are initialized in the page represent the database changes?
[18:06:10] <devi8> do you have a link to demonstrate?
[18:07:45] <devi8> bolovanos, what about something like: http://leaverou.github.io/awesomplete/
[18:08:08] <boxingoreos> One sec, Let me move something around.
[18:10:01] <devi8> bolovanos, try this: Its native in HTML5 I guess: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input
[18:11:04] <devi8> then you can use jquery to modify your data-list property on the input like: $("input").prop("data-list",newlist) I guess.
[18:15:36] <boxingoreos> Here is a link:  http://elevationrockgym.com/beta/index.php#list
[18:17:17] <devi8> bolovanos, actually in HTML5 native, you define the datalist element anywhere in your doc and then reference it to the 'list' property of an input for what you want. Then you modify the datalist to add the values you want using jquery
[18:19:20] <devi8> boxingoreos, it is unclear with edit+ and back which is editing just the field. it looks like you re-write to the db every time edit+ is clicked. Is this correct?
[18:20:14] <boxingoreos> Yes, the edit button executes the SQL update on that row
[18:21:04] <boxingoreos> Well, right now I have it going to a separate file to execute the SQL
[18:21:05] <devi8> perhaps it would be better to do multiple updates and a submit to update them all at once. Otherwise you have to reload the page after eafch submit
[18:22:29] <devi8> because then you could just update the view and store the model seperate...then update all at once.
[18:23:15] <boxingoreos> I don't mind that part as much.  It wont update or append anything within the listview div... This is probably basic, but I don't understand why the edit popups are reflecting the change the listview is not...
[18:26:46] <devi8> I don't see where you tell it to do anything with the popup data.
[18:27:51] <bolovanos> devi8, thank you will test it :)
[18:29:02] <boxingoreos> What do you mean?  So for instance, if I change any data on an entry, click the link to get back to the list and click the entry again... it will reflect changes in that popup, but the list is unchanged.  Seems strange
[18:29:42] <devi8> are you reloading the list after every write?
[18:30:34] <devi8> If you load the list once on page load, you have to manually update it every time you update the database. What you see on the screen is only a representation of page load state.
[18:31:03] <devi8> Instead, you could capture the form submit, parse the data in jquery and update the fields of your list before submittiting the data to php
[18:31:17] <boxingoreos> I would like to do that, but I'm not sure I understand how to reload the list?
[18:31:54] <devi8> your form that you popup uses PHP to send data to the SQL database on form submit, right?
[18:32:23] <boxingoreos> Yes
[18:32:51] <devi8> if so, capture the form submit in jquery $("form").on("submit", function ( e) { update the fields on the screen});
[18:33:25] <devi8> then your screen will "appear" to reflect the updated state of your list.
[18:35:29] <boxingoreos> Ah I see, that's a good idea.
[18:36:13] <boxingoreos> Thanks, I'll try going down that road.  I couldn't find anyway to handle updating things already in the listview outside of adding some plugins.
[18:36:46] <devi8> this is the basic idea: https://jsfiddle.net/3d3tsk4s/
[18:37:38] <devi8> I used plain english to describe what is going on, so you have to work out the field names and references and sucfh, but that's how I think it would work.
[18:40:03] <boxingoreos> Thanks!
[18:40:35] <boxingoreos> Side question.  Is there anyway to do a complete refresh of a page?
[18:41:12] <devi8> sure, just change the url to the same url, I think.
[18:41:50] <devi8> Use location.reload() : $('#something').click(function() { location.reload(); });   <--from google
[23:30:32] <fas3r> Hello
[23:30:44] <fas3r> how to restore a form from a serializeArray ?
[23:50:45] <devi8> what do you mean "restore a form"?
