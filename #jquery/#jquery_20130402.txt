[00:46:56] <zChris> What is the way to go about when you are looking for an element and dosent find it. How to check that ?
[00:47:03] <zChris> is there like a function named exists?
[00:48:05] <Cork> $('selector').length > 0
[00:48:32] <zChris> Thanks Cork
[00:48:38] <Cork> np
[00:51:39] <zChris> Cork, seems to be a trouble since i have to use find to find the element
[00:51:59] <Cork> variable.find().length > 0
[00:52:42] <Cork> zChris: if thats not what you mean, try explaining the situation
[00:53:39] <zChris> Cork, i get this Uncaught TypeError: Property 'length' of object [object Object] is not a function
[00:53:47] <zChris> on this if($(produkt).find('input[name=key]').length())
[00:54:08] <Cork> if($(produkt).find('input[name=key]').length > 0)
[00:54:31] <Cork> find and $() returns an array-like object
[00:54:44] <Cork> and its .length value contains how many matches there are in there
[00:54:45] <zChris> aaaah without () :) Thanks!
[01:19:09] <interop_madness> if i declare a plugin with   $.fn.foo = function (bar) { ... };  and i try to use it i get the error "$.foo is undefined". if i declare it with $.foo = function (bar) { ... }; it works. am i doing something wrong? jQuery version is 1.9.1
[01:20:03] <interop_madness> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring suggests thet  $.fn.foo... would be the correct syntax...
[01:24:45] <Cork> interop_madness: $.fn is for $('select').foo
[01:24:57] <Cork> $.foo is for if you run without a selector
[01:25:07] <Cork> (like .ajax, .get and so on)
[01:25:12] <interop_madness> oh, that explains it
[01:25:16] <interop_madness> thanks Cork
[01:55:04] <Mento> hey guys, im trying to add some basic paging to my table, but not sure how to paginate more table columns - http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/1/
[02:03:23] <Mento> any suggestions ?
[02:05:38] <BinaryKitten> Mento what are you trying to achieve?
[02:06:36] <Mento> well, i have basic table with content, i want to paginate between the columns like this http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/1/ - but i'm not sure how to paginate to the next items
[02:07:57] <BinaryKitten> right, by paginate you mean?
[02:08:42] * BinaryKitten has never done "columns"
[02:08:51] <BinaryKitten> always added in more rows
[02:09:14] <Mento> yes, well it should work somehow the same though
[02:09:43] <BinaryKitten> not really the same
[02:10:13] <BinaryKitten> since adding a tr to the table is easier than adding 6 tds to 6 trs
[02:11:52] <Mento> yes, well in my example the prev and next buttons are working though, but it's a very static example. i guess i need to add some counting but not sure if thats the way to go
[02:12:12] <Mento> since i don't need to add any new cols nor rows - they are there already
[02:12:28] <BinaryKitten> ah
[02:12:41] <BinaryKitten> so just a visual pagination
[02:12:41] <Mento> they are only hidden and need to be shown when the users hits the next button, or dissapear when someone hits prev
[02:12:54] <Mento> yes, BinaryKitten - just visual
[02:13:00] <BinaryKitten> right.. i'm with you now
[02:13:14] <BinaryKitten> give me a second, i've been tinkering with it
[02:17:13] <emka> Hi, having problems with datepicker
[02:17:35] <emka> I have a textfield and a link that triggers a datepicker on it
[02:18:09] <emka> works good as long as the textfield is visible, when I make it hidden either with css or type=hidden i get this jquery error
[02:18:12] <emka> "Cannot read property 'left' of undefined "
[02:18:25] <emka> any ideas why?
[02:18:29] <BinaryKitten> yep
[02:18:41] <BinaryKitten> hidden fields don't have those properties
[02:19:03] <BinaryKitten> datepicker assumes that the input is there and positions itself appropriately
[02:21:38] <BinaryKitten> hmm Mento tis complicated
[02:22:12] <Cork> Mento: i would prob do something like this http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/4/
[02:22:38] <Cork> (needs some checks for first and last element though)
[02:26:03] <emka> BinaryKitten: well…it doesnt display at all
[02:26:22] <emka> it works in one page, but not another...
[02:29:55] <emka> BinaryKitten: check this
[02:29:56] <emka> http://jsfiddle.net/UeSMg/1/
[02:29:57] <Ortund> A colleague has asked me to help her see why the image slider here keeps jumping. I've been able to determing it's something to do with the slide height, can anyone help me? http://cycling.netgendns.co.za
[02:31:29] <Mento> BinaryKitten i know :P
[02:31:43] <BinaryKitten> Mento i have a plan though
[02:31:44] <sacho> what are you talking about exactly?
[02:31:46] <Mento> Cork let me check it out
[02:31:53] <sacho> @Ortund
[02:33:11] <Ortund> sacho the images appear to "jump" on transition... in Chrome anyways. It looks like it's got something to do with their height. on slower transitions I can see about 20px difference between the old image and new one while the animation is in progress
[02:33:23] <sacho> "the images"?
[02:33:53] <Ortund> sacho the slider on the left of the page?
[02:35:05] <sacho> and the code for that is..?
[02:35:23] <Ortund> sacho, it's a jquery plugin... nivo slider
[02:36:59] <BinaryKitten> Mento: my offering http://jsfiddle.net/xUTnr/5/
[02:38:07] <Mento> lets how a look,  BinaryKitten thanks
[02:41:06] <seba4> one question. I got html that opens a form. inside a dialog. Everything workes fine.  I did add some live preview in dialog trough jquery and it did work when i added code to <script> inside of a form.
[02:41:31] <seba4> Now i did try to move that code from <script> to default .js file
[02:41:42] <seba4> now it doesnt work... what could be a problem?
[02:42:11] <BinaryKitten> seba4 check you loading time
[02:42:22] <BinaryKitten> your script could be firing before document ready
[02:42:27] <seba4> i did add
[02:42:30] <seba4> document ready
[02:42:41] <BinaryKitten> please pastebin your js file
[02:43:56] <seba4> this is the code i got inside..
[02:43:57] <seba4> http://pastebin.com/fz7qzdxc
[02:44:06] <seba4> even if i just try to hide some element
[02:44:14] <seba4> like some <input field>
[02:44:18] <seba4> it just doesnt hide it
[02:45:35] <Cork> seba4: is the form element added through ajax or similar?
[02:45:41] <Cork> -element
[02:45:43] <seba4> yea
[02:46:14] <Cork> then you can't depend on ready
[02:46:19] <Mento> BinaryKitten - thanks this really pushed me in the right direction
[02:46:34] <seba4> how then?
[02:46:38] <BinaryKitten> Mento that splits it up into pages
[02:46:47] <BinaryKitten> and then paginates those pages
[02:46:56] <Cork> seba4: well you can do it through always having the script section last in the form element
[02:47:01] <BinaryKitten> you can adjust the page break by chaning the perpage var
[02:47:04] <Cork> seba4: or run the script separately
[02:47:10] <Mento> yes, it works great this way
[02:48:38] <seba4> run separately_
[02:48:39] <seba4> ?
[02:50:00] <aep> anyone knows a decent tree widget, like the one extjs has
[02:50:14] <aep> with dnd
[02:53:54] <emka> can someone tell me what's wrong here?
[02:53:54] <emka> http://jsfiddle.net/UeSMg/4/
[02:54:00] <emka> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined
[02:54:07] <emka> when clicking Choose
[02:56:59] <BinaryKitten> emka if(!jQuery('#custom-filter-date').hasClass('hasDatePicker')){
[02:57:15] <BinaryKitten> in the html it has that class
[02:57:26] <BinaryKitten> so datepicker is never initialized
[02:57:36] <Mento> BinaryKitten - how do i make it paginate 1 col at a time while displaying 3 results on default
[02:57:53] <Mento> like default: show 1/2/3 - on next show 2/3/4 - etc
[02:58:09] <BinaryKitten> Mento ah
[03:01:01] <BinaryKitten> Mento that's really complicated
[03:01:12] <BinaryKitten> since you have no real definition of which is which
[03:01:26] <BinaryKitten> other than than the class
[03:02:38] <Mento> Yes, was just wondering if you had any thoughts about that, i'm trying to achieve it somehow with your great working example
[03:03:38] <aep> emka: class=hasDatepicker seems to be used internally. rename it
[03:04:04] <aep> (also what BinaryKitten said, i just realized that doesn't seem to solve it)
[03:05:09] <aep> emka: yep, naming both consistently hasDatePicker instead of hasDatepicker works. heh. (you had them mixed btw)
[03:06:02] <BinaryKitten> Mento unfortunatly i don't have the foggiest idea at present..
[03:06:07] <BinaryKitten> and i have to go to work
[03:06:36] <Mento> no problems, i really appreciate your help so far! got me in the right direction
[03:08:33] <BinaryKitten> Mento it got you in A direction, may not be the right one
[03:19:53] <lumax-web> Good Morning!
[03:21:24] <lumax-web> can someone of you point me in the right direction, i am writing a CakePHP based csv and xls Plugin and would like to implement a Importer Ui (fields match etc.). Is there a base app on Github for jQuery?
[03:22:57] <emka> ok BinaryKitten
[03:23:02] <emka> http://jsfiddle.net/UeSMg/6/
[03:23:13] <emka> now…and hidden I get the same error as I do on my page...
[03:24:58] <maskio> what is wrong with my code?
[03:24:59] <maskio> http://jsfiddle.net/Wnp4P/1/
[03:25:11] <maskio> i was hoping to clone the element
[04:10:28] <portishead> hey guys, anyone here familiar with foundation-zurb?
[04:16:49] <Croves> Hello guys! Let me ask you something: is there any way that I can check if the user has selected a file in a <input type=file> ?
[04:17:25] <Croves> Let's supose that I have a field like this in my form, and the user has clicked to upload a file. I need to know if he selected a file or hit the cancel button
[04:20:06] <Cork> Croves: i think $('selector').val() !== '' should work
[04:20:11] <pachet> Croves: listen to the onchange event of that element
[04:20:27] <pachet> oh
[04:20:32] <Croves> Thank you Cork and pachet. I'll take a look at both suggestions
[04:25:30] <Aquaguy> Hello
[04:27:03] <Aquaguy> I''m using jQuery 1.9.1 and I'm experiencing a problem in Chrome, when I have the developer tools opened, jQuery does not load properly, for instance jQuery ui doesn't work (sortable, draggable...)
[04:27:25] <Grundell> Hello, i have a problem... i have a script ajax loiad script that is suposed to load two other scripts with it. on my dev site it works flawless but when i transfered it doesnt seam like it fallowed... the site is http://www.larmkollen.se/alert-alarm/ and the ajax button is called "prisjämförelse" - the code is the fallowing : http://jsfiddle.net/8vTFM/ - does anyone feel like they have time to take a look at it ?
[04:27:37] <Aquaguy> but if I close the dev tools and reload the page, it all works out, why is this?
[04:33:49] <Cork> Grundell: your getScript calls doens't seam to work
[04:34:19] <Aquaguy> #jquery-dev
[04:34:31] <Aquaguy> sh*t haha
[04:35:04] <pm28> Aquaguy: /join channelname
[04:35:24] <Cork> Grundell: ah, your doing cross domain ajax calls
[04:35:41] <daanavitch> how can I bind only one click event to dynamically added elements?
[04:36:25] <Cork> daanavitch: normally its better to add one delegated event listener to a parent and handle it there
[04:36:36] <NoWired> anyone knows if exists a js/jquery library, to generate a graphic like this: http://greer.nodolinux.com/pic/linux/DiagramaLinux.jpg ?
[04:36:52] <Cork> daanavitch: $('parent').on('click', 'child selector', function(event) {})
[04:37:11] <Aquaguy> pm28: I know, I just forgot to type it, thank you though
[04:37:16] <daanavitch> Cork: thanks, I'll try that
[04:37:39] <boytoy> How do I get this fading in "Hello world" to simultaneously slide in animate? http://jsfiddle.net/8jcry/
[04:38:11] <Cork> boytoy: do the fade animation (opacity) in the animate call
[04:38:29] <boytoy> kewl I never thought of that
[04:40:56] <boytoy> much like this or? http://jsfiddle.net/8jcry/1/
[04:42:30] <boytoy> err http://jsfiddle.net/8jcry/2/, actually lemme give it some more tries first
[04:43:45] <pm28> Aquaguy: sh*t happens ;)
[04:45:38] <divout> http://jsfiddle.net/divout/8jcry/3/ boytoy:
[04:46:31] <Aquaguy> I'm experiencing some issue when using 1.9.1 and having Chrome's developer tools opened, jQuery is not properly loaded and things like jquery ui's draggable/sortable... don't work, when closing dev tools and reloading the window everything works properly, I guess it's because of an exception that is being raised. I don't really know, anyone else is experiencing this problem?
[04:47:10] <Cork> Aquaguy: try with a clean minimalistic page
[04:47:12] <Cork> works fine here
[04:47:52] <emka> why doesnt this work?
[04:47:53] <emka> http://jsfiddle.net/StUsH/
[04:48:18] <boytoy> divout: nice :)
[04:48:38] <Cork> emka: http://jsfiddle.net/StUsH/17/
[04:48:47] <Cork> it helps if you include jquery ui
[04:49:17] <boytoy> divout: Should I maybe move the CSS to the JS in future iterations?
[04:49:55] <divout> no
[04:50:39] <Cork> css should be in the css file as much as you possibly can
[04:50:53] <Cork> that makes it a lot simpler to maintain later
[04:51:02] <Cork> btw $("a").on("click", $("a"), function(event) is not valid
[04:51:16] <boytoy> cool got it
[04:51:23] <Cork> you want something like  $(document).on("click", "a", function(event)
[04:51:30] <boytoy> yeah im gonna replace it with a var or something
[04:51:33] <boytoy> oh ok
[04:51:49] <jimmy> Hello
[04:51:52] <jimmy> I have a problem with Jquery
[04:52:02] <jimmy> I use the minified version of
[04:52:07] <jimmy> Jquery from the server.
[04:52:24] <jimmy> And when i try to use the first example in the tutorial,it gives me 304 Not Modified
[04:52:34] <jimmy> What the hell am i supposed to here?
[04:52:50] <Aquaguy> Cork the minimalistic page fails  too
[04:52:52] <gordian> jimmy: which tutorial?
[04:52:57] <jimmy> The official one
[04:53:02] <jimmy> From the Jquery website
[04:53:04] <gordian> jimmy: it also helps to post your code on jsfiddle.net
[04:53:08] <jimmy> Will do
[04:54:17] <fabioportieri> hello
[04:54:21] <fabioportieri> a lot of deejays here
[04:54:47] <jimmy> http://jsfiddle.net/2vTRz/
[04:55:20] <Aquaguy> This works for you guys (with the developer tools opened)
[04:55:23] <Aquaguy> http://jsfiddle.net/my9ZA/
[04:55:24] <fabioportieri> lol
[04:55:45] <Aquaguy> That was a question, forgot the question mark
[04:56:02] <jimmy> So whats the problem with my code?
[04:56:24] <khaan> hi everybody: how do i trigger a css transition on page load? :)
[04:56:42] <Aquaguy> khaan adding a class
[04:57:00] <dsyme> is it possible to do $('body>header') as a selector?
[04:57:11] <Aquaguy> $(document).ready( function () { $('#foo').addClass('whatever'); });
[04:57:13] <gordian> jimmy: you're missing closing characters for the .ready() method
[04:57:27] <jimmy> got it to work on jsfiddle
[04:57:28] <khaan> aquaguy: thank you!
[04:57:35] <jimmy> but doesnt work on my computer
[04:58:04] <gordian> jimmy: if the code is identical then it should work
[04:58:09] <jimmy> it is
[04:58:15] <Cork> Aquaguy: yes, that test works for me
[04:58:22] <gordian> are you using internet explorer 6?
[04:58:24] <jimmy> But here
[04:58:27] <jimmy> No lol
[04:58:33] <jimmy> Its Chromium on Lubuntu 12.04
[04:58:38] <Aquaguy> :S It doesn't for me, not in the normal release nor in the canary build
[04:59:01] <jimmy> Tried with Firefox too and the Firefox Developer Console says: 304 Not Modified
[04:59:18] <gordian> jimmy: are you sure you're including jquery properly?
[04:59:19] <jimmy> Tried including Jquery both from my host and the CDN
[04:59:23] <jimmy> yes
[04:59:31] <jimmy> type="text/javascript" src="link here"
[04:59:38] <jimmy> with and without the type attribute tried
[04:59:53] <pm28> jimmy: http://jsfiddle.net/2vTRz/1/
[05:00:25] <Cork> jimmy: your not closing your outer function
[05:00:48] <jimmy> Nope
[05:00:54] <gordian> [07:57am] jimmy: got it to work on jsfiddle
[05:00:55] <gordian> [07:57am] jimmy: but doesnt work on my computer
[05:00:56] <jimmy> it still goes 304 Unmodified
[05:01:06] <Cork> ah
[05:01:18] <Cork> and what does 304 have to do with jquery?
[05:01:33] <Cork> thats just a server response
[05:01:34] <jimmy> When the page request Jquetry
[05:01:38] <jimmy> requests*
[05:01:42] <jimmy> Jquery
[05:01:47] <jimmy> It goes "304 Unmodified"
[05:01:50] <Cork> ya?
[05:01:57] <Cork> that just means the browser has it in the cache
[05:02:12] <jimmy>     http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js
[05:02:12] <jimmy>   
[05:02:12] <jimmy>

[05:02:25] <jimmy>   
[05:02:27] <jimmy> Oh god
[05:02:30] <jimmy> sorry
[05:02:30] <gordian> jesus man
[05:02:48] <Aquaguy> jimmy: use a paste bin or something man
[05:03:01] <jimmy> im sorry it was a single line when copied it
[05:03:07] <jimmy> from the XUL window
[05:03:12] <gordian> jimmy: try <script type='text/javascript' src='//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js'></script>
[05:03:17] <Cork> jimmy: http status 304 means that when the user requested the file it sent a date, and the server responds that the file haven't changed since then
[05:03:37] <Cork> its nothing wrong with a 304 response, its perfectly normal
[05:03:41] <pm28> jimmy: try this http://pastie.org/7278406
[05:05:05] <jimmy> nope
[05:05:07] <jimmy> still the same
[05:05:27] <Cork> jimmy: what is the problem you're trying to solve?
[05:05:30] <gordian> pm28: what is that?
[05:05:38] <jimmy> I want to load Jquery
[05:05:44] <jimmy> but exactly at the script inclusion line
[05:05:49] <Cork> from the response it says you already have it
[05:05:52] <jimmy> It gives me 304 Not Modified
[05:06:01] <jimmy> So i dont need to include it?
[05:06:05] <Cork> and that means its already in the browser cache
[05:06:08] <pm28> gordian: its complete html
[05:06:09] <Cork> yes you do
[05:06:20] <Cork> but you don't need to fetch it, cause the browser already have it in its cache
[05:06:33] <jimmy> So how do i go about this?
[05:06:37] <Cork> 304 is basically the same as a 200
[05:06:39] <gordian> pm28: that looks insane
[05:06:52] <Cork> just treat it as if you got a 200, the content should be there
[05:07:01] <jimmy> Well the code doesn`t work
[05:07:09] <jimmy> And tried the versions from the guy here
[05:07:14] <jimmy> that posted me the jsfiddle
[05:07:22] <gordian> jimmy
[05:07:23] <jimmy> Mine and his plus the tutorial one works on jsfiddle
[05:07:26] <pm28> I tried here http://www.onlinehtmleditor.net/ and it was working for me
[05:07:30] <Cork> jimmy: try ctrl+f5
[05:07:30] <gordian> poste the entire contents of your file on pastebin.com
[05:07:35] <jimmy> ok
[05:07:38] <Cork> jimmy: if that doens't help clear your cache
[05:08:07] <Cork> and if THAT doesn't help, then the problem is somewhere else
[05:08:21] <jimmy> http://pastebin.com/md6yxht6
[05:08:33] <pm28> gordian: chrome inspect element :)
[05:08:45] <jimmy> told 20-30 lines before this one, i disabled cache and cleared it
[05:08:48] <jimmy> still doesnt work
[05:08:49] <Cork> jimmy: you need to include jquery in there
[05:09:02] <jimmy> it is
[05:09:04] <gordian> pm28: potato salad :D
[05:09:06] <Cork> no
[05:09:10] <jimmy> dont you the script tag?
[05:09:16] <Cork> thats your code
[05:09:20] <Cork> you need to include the framework
[05:09:23] <jimmy> oh yeah i deleted it
[05:09:24] <gordian> jimmy: PASTEBIN.COM
[05:09:25] <jimmy> but yeah
[05:09:27] <jimmy> MAN
[05:09:28] <jimmy> lol
[05:09:30] <jimmy> included it
[05:09:33] <jimmy> before pasting
[05:09:44] <Cork> jimmy: also never EVER use  document.write("hello world");
[05:09:57] <Cork> its not reliable, and causes all kind of nasty problems
[05:10:23] <jimmy> I`m using it just to test the library functioning
[05:10:28] <gordian> pastebin your entire code jimmy
[05:10:30] <Cork> $(document.body).html('hello world'); does basically the same thing, without all the risks
[05:10:36] <jimmy> Ok
[05:11:09] <jimmy> This is the one with src included
[05:11:12] <jimmy> http://pastebin.com/5kbSasnv
[05:11:20] <jimmy> With the one from ajax.googleapis.com
[05:11:28] <pm28> gordian: share the salad
[05:11:30] <pm28> lol
[05:11:45] <Cork> jimmy: <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"><script type="text/javascript">
[05:11:45] <gordian> http://divshot.github.com/geo-bootstrap/
[05:11:57] <Cork> opps
[05:11:59] <gordian> my bad
[05:12:07] <jimmy> yeah noticed it
[05:12:08] <Cork> jimmy: meant <script type="text/javascript" src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript">
[05:12:13] <jimmy> and added http
[05:12:18] <jimmy> oh
[05:12:19] <jimmy> ok
[05:12:24] <Cork> jimmy: also use a better site
[05:12:32] <gordian> you don't need http
[05:12:32] <Cork> like jsfiddle, jsbin, webdevout.net
[05:12:36] <Cork> ya
[05:12:52] <gordian> Cork: his problem is that it is working on jsfiddle but not on his localhost
[05:13:03] <jimmy> WORKS
[05:13:15] <Cork> yes, but if you use a bin or what ever you can edit it, without creating 100 pb's
[05:13:18] <jimmy> so i needed to use a script tag for jquery
[05:13:20] <gordian> congratulations on solving the silliest problem ever
[05:13:23] <pm28> yay POTATO SALAD for everyone lol
[05:13:32] <jimmy> i feel really stupid now
[05:13:39] <jimmy> but the examples tell you to not use another tag
[05:13:45] <Cork> jimmy: a script tag with a src attribute will ignore its content
[05:13:48] <gordian> Cork: but the fiddles do the includes automatically
[05:13:56] <jimmy> Cork: will keep that in mind next time
[05:13:58] <jimmy> Thanks guys!
[05:14:02] <Cork> gordian: so use jsbin or webdevout
[05:14:07] <gordian> if it works on the fiddle but not on his machine then it stands to reason there's something wrong with his markup
[05:14:26] <Cork> gordian: i'm not arguing about that
[05:14:36] <Cork> i argue about using one time pb's
[05:14:46] <Mosselmaniac> hi all
[05:14:48] <Mosselmaniac> i'm lost
[05:14:52] <gordian> that's what pb is there for!
[05:15:00] <gordian> Mosselmaniac: you're on Earth
[05:15:01] * Cork Mosselmaniac a mat
[05:15:04] <Cork> *map
[05:15:07] <gordian> this is called I-R-C
[05:15:15] <Mosselmaniac> I'm using: $.ajax('orders/calculate/calculate' + dataString, null ,function(data) {........... });
[05:15:18] <gordian> w-e-l-c-o-m-e
[05:15:49] <Mosselmaniac> i can see the correct response in my firebug, and i want to alert(data) inside that function
[05:15:54] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: cross domain?
[05:15:57] <Mosselmaniac> but it just doesn't work. no output.
[05:16:04] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: same domain.
[05:16:23] <Cork> do you get a call to fail/error?
[05:16:34] <Mosselmaniac> No, everything is fine. correct output
[05:16:45] <Cork> didn't you say no output?
[05:17:26] <Cork> $.ajax('orders/calculate/calculate' + dataString, {}).done(function(data) { alert('works') }).fail(function() { alert('syntax error!'); })
[05:18:07] <daanavitch> I have a few anchor links on my page, how can I prevent it from scrolling when clicked, but still add the anchor to the browser's address bar?
[05:18:48] <Cork> .g mdn manipulate history @ daanavitch
[05:18:49] <b-ot> daanavitch: Sorry, no results for ‟mdn manipulate history @ daanavitch”.
[05:18:50] <boytoy> At this animated slide-in: http://jsfiddle.net/8jcry/4/ - how to get the "Here I am" to align nicely next to "Click me" as if there was no position absolute? Here's a failed attempt to use margin left: http://jsfiddle.net/8jcry/5/
[05:19:01] <Cork> ?g mdn manipulate history
[05:19:01] <b-ot> Cork: Manipulating the browser history - Mozilla Developer Center → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[05:19:06] <Cork> daanavitch: ^
[05:19:28] <daanavitch> but does this work in all browsers?
[05:19:34] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: i mean the GET gives me output
[05:19:39] <Mosselmaniac> but the alert doesn't.
[05:19:40] <daanavitch> seems kinda low-level
[05:20:05] <Cork> daanavitch: no, and in the ones that doesn't you can't do it (unless the has doens't match an id or name in the page)
[05:20:31] <Cork> daanavitch: and the ones that it doens't work in is, ie<10 (possibly 10 too)
[05:21:04] <daanavitch> Cork: sucks, can't I just disable the scrolling for a local link, but leave the default behavior for adding the hash to the browser's address bar?
[05:21:38] <Cork> daanavitch: you could do a hack where you wait for the browser to scroll and then scroll it back :s
[05:22:00] <Cork> or you could temporary remove the id from the target element
[05:22:09] <Cork> both are kinda horrible
[05:26:37] <boytoy> figured it out thanks again guys
[05:27:21] <Mosselmaniac> I'm sorry... phone...
[05:27:29] <Mosselmaniac> Cork: It is the same domain.
[05:27:34] <Mosselmaniac> strange eh?
[05:27:54] <Cork> Mosselmaniac: like i said try $.ajax('orders/calculate/calculate' + dataString, {}).done(function(data) { alert('works') }).fail(function() { alert('syntax error!'); })
[05:29:47] <kracekumar_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15750582/ajax-breaks-in-mobile-browser
[05:29:57] <kracekumar_> $.ajax breaks on mobile
[05:30:43] <kracekumar_> https://github.com/kracekumar/test-flask/blob/master/README.md error message
[05:31:02] <kracekumar_> basically when $.ajax is submitted in mobile browser chrome, POST fails
[05:31:35] <Cork> kracekumar_: is the page your loading from in http://localhost:8888 ?
[05:31:58] <kracekumar_> Cork, I use IP in mobile and
[05:32:25] <Cork> kracekumar_: the ip, port, hostname, and protocol have to be the same
[05:32:37] <Cork> or the browser will block you cause of cross domain calls
[05:33:10] <kracekumar_> Cork, Got it
[05:33:35] <Cork> kracekumar_: its a bit picker if your using localhost, and special ports
[05:33:47] <Cork> normally you have a little more wiggle room
[05:34:03] <kracekumar_> Cork, if is use ip in localhost I get cors error in console,
[05:34:14] <seutje> ur logging the jqXHR object, not the error message
[05:34:44] <kracekumar_> seutje, yes, XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost:8888/json. Origin http://10.42.1.200:8888 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[05:34:59] <kracekumar_> let ,e check this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10143093/origin-is-not-allowed-by-access-control-allow-origin
[05:35:03] <kracekumar_> *me
[05:35:06] <Cork> so the origin isn't the same
[05:35:28] <Cork> kracekumar_: if you want to load from localhost everything needs to be loaded from there
[05:35:36] <Cork> you can't do one by ip and one by name
[05:35:37] <kracekumar_> Cork, got the point
[05:35:40] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I have an issue with date validation in jQuery validate.  It's the issue with the UK date in Chrome, I've created a test in JSFiddle and using the DateITA validation from the addition-methods.js works OK, but when I reflect this update on my actual page i get the following:  Error: TypeError: e.validator.methods[o] is undefined
[05:36:09] <Stephen-B> Page with the error: http://37.220.92.92:81/Apply-for-finance-online.asp
[05:36:20] <daanavitch> Cork: I think I found a solution, it's really easy to just set window.location.hash
[05:36:35] <granden_> I would like to make an POST ajax request, how would I get all the <input> fields from the <form id="myForm"> I got on the page to send it easily?
[05:36:48] <seutje> ?serialize
[05:36:49] <Cork> hmm, daanavitch and that doesn't scroll the browser?
[05:36:55] <Stephen-B> granden: serialize the form
[05:36:58] <Cork> i would expect it to
[05:37:05] <seutje> granden_: $form.serialize()
[05:37:37] <granden_> Stephen-B: seutje But, serialize it aint that just for get ajax requests?
[05:37:39] <daanavitch> Cork: I still use e.preventDefault and then get the hash from the link and manually set it as window.location.hash
[05:37:50] <granden_> Or does the data in a POST request takes a serilize string?
[05:38:04] <Cork> daanavitch: ya, i understand, i just expected it to actually scroll the page when you changed .hash
[05:38:23] <seutje> granden_: if u pass an object to the data parameter, it'll even be serialized automagically iirc
[05:38:24] <daanavitch> Cork: nope! seems to work great
[05:38:49] <Stephen-B> I use that for ajax posts but I don't see why it won't in another situation
[05:39:21] <granden_> Ok, thanks, seutje and Stephen-B
[05:39:22] <Stephen-B> Granden_: http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:39:49] <Stephen-B> Anyone got any ideas regarding the date validation issue I just posted?

[05:40:49] <Cork> >_>
[05:40:54] <seutje> `jqapi serialize
[05:40:58] <Cork> i'm quite sure its meant to support it...
[05:41:28] <seutje> that was bot-t, wasn't it?
[05:41:38] <seutje> this is ircjs bot
[05:42:06] <Cork> bot-t is meant to be replaced by b-ot
[05:43:36] <seutje> `api serialize
[05:43:36] <b-ot> seutje: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[05:43:39] <seutje> aha!
[05:43:41] <Cork> ah
[05:44:01] <Cork> liked the old syntax better
[05:44:26] <seutje> yeah, but this follows the rest of the plugins, I suppose
[05:47:55] <Pal-an> Hi

[05:48:33] <Pal-an> new Request.JSON is not taking local json file....what is the problem over here???
[05:49:04] <portishead> howdy
[05:49:09] <portishead> guise cmon?
[05:49:12] <Stephen-B> Sorry to bump, but bump! Any got any ideas regarding the validate issue I described?
[05:49:57] <Pal-an> mooTools Textbox list working fine in demo same thing i downloaded....but it's not working my local host
[05:50:30] <Pal-an> can any leave your valuable comments about my question....
[05:51:08] <Pal-an> can any one leave your valuable comments about my question....
[05:51:32] <gordian> i'm messing around with scrollspy here: http://jsfiddle.net/AzSWV/2/
[05:51:36] <gordian> everything works just fine
[05:51:47] <gordian> but if you uncomment the CSS you'll see the layout becomes horizontal
[05:51:50] <Cork> Stephen-B: you can't bump on irc, cause ppl have normally missed the question if you didn't get an answer
[05:51:53] <gordian> and scrollyspy does not work
[05:52:16] <Stephen-B> Cork: Fair point, full repost then!
[05:52:21] <gordian> when you scroll horizontally the corresponding nav menu item should get an active class
[05:52:33] <gordian> i've tweaked myself unconscious and can't make it work
[05:52:56] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I have an issue with date validation in jQuery validate.

[05:53:10] <Stephen-B> http://37.220.92.92:81/Apply-for-finance-online.asp
[05:53:13] <gordian> even tried a github gist that was supposedly tweaked for horizontal scrollspy and it doesn't work
[05:53:54] <gordian> maybe this is an issue for shoky
[05:54:17] <kracekumar_> Cork, CORS problem solved by adding response.headers.add('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'), in web browser, but in mobile site breaks
[05:54:25] <Anticom> Stephen-B sorry can't test... no chrome over here :P
[05:54:56] <Cork> kracekumar_: make sure the browser supports it, and that it allows cors for private ip spans
[05:56:10] <kracekumar_> Same error in README.md
[05:56:25] <Cork> so the origin header doesn't help
[05:56:32] <defaultro> Morning folks, what would be a good alternative title to "application programming consultant"?
[05:56:52] <Cork> kracekumar_: you could try replaying with the origin the browser sends to the server
[05:57:04] <kracekumar_> 'withCredentials' in new XMLHttpRequest() returns true in mobile
[06:09:35] <gordian> baaaaaaaa!!!! horizontal scrollspy!!!!!!!!!!!
[06:18:38] <granden_> Hi, I got a bit of problems with two jquery stuffs, can find them here, http://pastebin.com/thFVJmLj first one does not work the click version. But the second one does, which is a normal submit.
[06:18:42] <granden_> Any ideas why?
[06:18:53] <gordian> granden_: post to jsfiddle.net instead
[06:20:02] <granden_> gordian: Dunno how to implement an crop ajax script on jsfiddle
[06:20:35] <granden_> ok, this is strange, think I got the error now. But dunno why it does not work
[06:20:43] <granden_> I dont have any post variables
[06:20:48] <granden_> from that ajax function
[06:20:54] <djQuery> granden_, well is it the ajax part that you are having an issue with or just the values?
[06:21:05] <granden_> seams to be the values only
[06:21:27] <djQuery> granden_, so don't wory about the ajax
[06:27:08] <Stephen-B> Hi all, I have an issue with date validation in jQuery validate.

[06:27:32] <Aquaguy> is there a shorthand function to quick access data- attributes?
[06:28:14] <Aquaguy> instead of doing obj.attr('data-id'); doing obj.adata('id');
[06:28:23] <Aquaguy> or something like that
[06:28:37] <granden_> djQuery: Hah, found my error during the creation of the fiddle. I had missed a # when doing the serilize()
[06:49:54] <hashpuppy> i'm looking at some old javascript code that checks for event.preventDefault and then uses event.returnValue = false if it doesn't exist.  jquery redefines preventDefault so that this is not necessary, right?
[06:50:03] <hashpuppy> assuming the event is being fired from jquery
[06:50:14] <hashpuppy> handled
[06:50:48] <daanavitch> any suggestions for a video player plugin?
[06:51:31] <ph88_> what's the difference between .change() and .on("change",  ...)   ???
[06:55:35] <masentinel900> Good morning guys!!
[06:55:48] <Aquaguy> good afternoon
[06:56:12] <masentinel900> Someone know how can I to change the size of the datepicker widget of jquery ui?
[06:56:55] <Aquaguy> masentinel900: you can change the look of the datapicker, includen the size using css
[06:57:19] <Aquaguy> including*
[06:57:25] <ph88> sorry i disconnect, did someone reply to:      what's the difference between .change() and .on("change",  ...)  ??
[06:57:48] <lejocelyn> hi, how would you do with $.ajax() to send the default POST data?
[06:57:49] <Aquaguy> ph88 I think it's just a shorthand function such as .click,
[06:57:52] <masentinel900> Aquaguy: I need to add a new style?
[06:58:01] <pachet> ph88: .change() is just a convenience wrapper for .on('change')
[06:58:09] <ph88> ok thx guys !
[06:58:12] <pachet> if you dont pass anything in, it will trigger the 'change' event for that element
[06:58:18] <lejocelyn> I don't want to specify particular POST data, I want the post data of my inputs to be sent
[06:58:23] <ph88> is there a best practse which of the two to use ?
[06:58:32] <pachet> ph88: .on
[06:58:38] <ph88> oki
[06:59:46] <anew> nothing inside $(window).load(function()
[06:59:47] <anew> {}) is loading for me, but i'm not getting any errors in the console
[06:59:49] <anew> anyone have any ideas ?
[07:00:11] <lejocelyn> is $.post() what I'm looking for ?
[07:00:12] <lejocelyn> :D
[07:00:47] <Aquaguy> anew why don't you use $(document).ready( function () {});
[07:01:21] <anew> that's not the problem, i have to use (window) for what i want to do
[07:01:24] <djQuery> ph88, .change just calls .on('change'
[07:01:26] <anew> dont want to wayt for document
[07:02:46] <djQuery> aneki, I think .load has been depreciated
[07:02:54] <pachet> lejocelyn: depends what you mean by 'default post data'
[07:02:58] <djQuery> anew, ^^
[07:03:02] <anew> anyone know why $(document).ready(function(){} will nto load inside script tags ?
[07:03:08] <ph88> input[type=radio][name=tab]    <-- is this a valid jquery selector ?
[07:03:09] <anew> well i changed to ready wont work either
[07:03:17] <anew> on one page it is working, on another page it is not ...
[07:03:36] <pachet> you're sure there are no errors?
[07:03:46] <deepy> was it called after the document was ready?
[07:03:47] <anew> yeah i have console open hit refresh and nothing shows in console ...
[07:03:53] <djQuery> ph88, yeah just a slow on
[07:03:55] <djQuery> e
[07:04:17] <anew> i mean it's the same issue if i use document.ready or window.load
[07:04:21] <anew> neither are working inside my script tags
[07:04:24] <anew> i cant even console.log
[07:04:27] <anew> not sure why
[07:04:31] <ph88_> sorry disconnect again :/  did someone reply to :   input[type=radio][name=tab]    <-- is this a valid jquery selector ? ?
[07:04:41] <anew> i tried var my = noconflict also
[07:04:43] <anew> but didnt work
[07:04:47] <deepy> anew: can you put an example on jsbin.com?
[07:04:49] <pachet> < djQuery> ph88, yeah just a slow one
[07:04:49] <anew> (pseudocode)
[07:05:21] <djQuery> ph88_, $('input[type="radio"][name="tab"]')
[07:05:23] <lejocelyn> pachet: like what I would get in my php script with  $_POST
[07:05:39] <ph88_> oki thx djQuery
[07:05:57] <anli> Is there a problem using .fadeIn(0) ?
[07:06:05] <anli> Or .fadeOut(0)
[07:06:26] <djQuery> ph88_, I like giving them unique clases that match thier name at that point  radio_tab for example
[07:06:29] <pachet> anli: a couple of unnecessary function calls
[07:06:33] <pachet> but nothing worldbreaking
[07:06:54] <anli> That would not be a problem
[07:07:18] <anli> They use more than the opacity style, right
[07:07:27] <anli> Also IE7 filters
[07:07:41] <pachet> pretty sure they'd just get set to display:none
[07:08:27] <anli> If they do not set the opacity as well, they will be of no use
[07:09:39] <anli> .animate({opacity: 1}, 0); and .animate({opacity: 0}, 0); is what I seek for
[07:10:32] <lejocelyn> pachet: example : http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/
[07:10:43] <Grundell_> cork - still online ?
[07:11:09] <lejocelyn> pachet: I want to replace the current form by a message
[07:11:22] <lejocelyn> send the data to http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/
[07:12:15] <lejocelyn> send the data to ../control/control_add_info.php and just actualize the display with my message
[07:15:21] <ph88> i made this small function to switch the content of a div when clicking on a tab http://pastebin.com/57BuyG8H   it works , except one div with contents hold a select box with options. When switching html it doesn't include the select ... what am i doing wrong ??  (the functionality works because it does copy the normal text from the div)
[07:20:51] <lejocelyn> Ahh, actually, $.post() just retrieves a webpage and send the data where it should be sent
[07:21:16] <lejocelyn> so I just have to specify which part of the form I want to replace :D
[07:21:31] <lejocelyn> and the HTML code I'll use for that :)
[07:22:17] <ph88> nvm got it :D
[07:29:28] <jsmonkey> Hi, I am having some problem. If I have a page with 3 pages. And I link from another page only the first is loaded. Not the others. If I go to the page and do a hard refresh I can see link to the other pages. Is it like jquery mobile only ajax loads the page stuff and not the other dom elements?
[07:29:33] <jsmonkey> how to fix?
[07:31:45] <momomomomo> jsmonkey: Post your code to http://gist.github.com/ (all related code and errors), and then come back and explain: What you're trying to do, what the issue is, and what you think has gone wrong. This will help people be able to digest/understand your problem. Also check this out when you get a chance: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[07:32:13] <lejocely1> I don't get why my post function doesn't work http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/2/
[07:32:31] <lejocely1> I just get to the form action
[07:33:11] <lejocely1> http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/3/
[07:33:50] <momomomomo> lejocely1: see my above comment
[07:34:28] <lejocely1> momomomomo: I though I was explaining enough
[07:34:30] <jsmonkey> momomomomo: I know think I know what the problem is. To much code for a gist or fiddle tho. Jquery mobile ajax navigation only loads the first jqm page and ignores the rest. if howevery doing a refresh, I get all the pages. I need to somehow force ajax navigation to not just load the first page but to load the whole body (like a hard refresh on that page)
[07:34:33] <nFFF> lejocely1, what are you trying to achieve? Your post function doesn't actually send any data to the server? And your not prventing default action
[07:34:35] <jsmonkey> tips?
[07:34:59] <lejocely1> nFFF: I though .post() would send the default data
[07:35:30] <lejocely1> I mean, the data from the input to the form's action script
[07:35:37] <ph88> hey guys i have a select2 box ( http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/ )  and i'm moving it around in my html with jquery, after the move the select2 functionality is gone. How do i apply the functionality on the new location?  My guess is that select2 keeps the location internally and can not find the box anymore after i run my own script
[07:36:01] <nFFF> ?post @ lejocely1
[07:36:14] <momomomomo> jsmonkey: without any code, I have no idea what you're doing wrong.
[07:36:33] <nFFF> lejocely1, you would serialize your form, then prevent the form's default action (to submit), and do it via AJAX ($.post)
[07:37:08] <lejocely1> what I want is that, when the user clicks on submit button, it sends the normal post data to the form's action php script and replace, in case of success with message1, or message2 in case of error
[07:37:44] <lejocely1> nFFF: I'm not sure I get the use of post then
[07:37:47] <ph88> oh i think i found the problem i have an id="" in two places now :/
[07:37:54] <lejocely1> I thought it was exactly its function
[07:38:49] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/4/
[07:38:54] <nFFF> something like that
[07:39:24] <johan_mlg> Hi! Im trying to figure out how to run two versions of jquery and jquery mobile at the same time. Im stuck with a framework that uses query 1.6 and jquery mobile 1.0, and I need to use more modern versions of both. Ive figured out if can fix query by using $.noConflict, but how can I do it for jQuery mobile?
[07:40:24] <lejocely1> nFFF: then the serialize data will look exactly the same for my php script or do I have to adapt it ?
[07:40:37] <nFFF> lejocely1, should look the same
[07:40:50] <nFFF> I only skimmed your code
[07:41:00] <nFFF> so not sure exactly it is your trying to do?
[07:41:16] <nFFF> You want to send form data to the server via AJAX?
[07:41:20] <lejocely1> yes
[07:42:09] <lejocely1> I want to do it in a way so that the form action php script is executed but the user stays on the same page with its content updated
[07:42:45] <nFFF> Yes, so when the user clicks your submit button
[07:43:02] <nFFF> you need to first: prevent the default action, which is to send the data to the server and load a new page
[07:43:12] <nFFF> which is ?preventDefault()
[07:43:29] <nFFF> You then need to pragmatically send the data to the server using AJAX
[07:43:58] <lejocely1> ok
[07:44:04] <lejocely1> I think I understood
[07:45:22] <chuwiey> hi all… pls take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/ — why doesn't this work? (notice that the source tags don't have attributes once the code runs)
[07:55:20] <chuwiey> nobody?
[07:55:48] <Jester86> whats up chuwiey?
[07:55:50] <lejocely1> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/7rFyb/7/ it doesn't actually display the success message while it gets it (according to firebug)
[07:56:16] <chuwiey> Jester86: hi all… pls take a look at: http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/ — why doesn't this work? (notice that the source tags don't have attributes once the code runs)
[07:56:40] <lejocely1> nFFF: when I use firebug, it doesn't go into the function(data){}
[07:57:10] <lejocely1> it just goes to fail but doesn't execute it as it's not an error case
[07:57:23] <Jester86> chuwiey are you positive jsfiddle supports video playback?
[07:57:33] <chuwiey> 100%
[07:57:42] <chuwiey> if you remove the code, you'll see the video
[07:58:14] <Jester86> So what exactly are you trying to do?
[07:59:05] <chuwiey> Jester86: I'm removing the video element and then recreating it from scratch.
[08:00:35] <Jester86> chuwiey what you're doing doesn't make much sense to me
[08:00:49] <Jester86> You're trying to remove the src and then reset it to the exact same thing?
[08:01:13] <chuwiey> i am trying to remove the whole element and then recreate the same exact thing
[08:01:29] <Jester86> What you have won't do that.
[08:01:48] <xdjuj> Why doing this as there's a lot of libraries already making it no ? :)
[08:01:52] <Jester86> you aren't recreating <video>
[08:02:17] <Jester86> you remove it but then its just gone..
[08:02:34] <chuwiey> Jester86:  why not? that's what tmp.appendTo does… ?
[08:03:09] <Jester86> tmp contains whatever that instance of <video> contains.. when its removed tmp is essentially removed
[08:03:41] <chuwiey> but tmp is a completely new element, no?
[08:03:52] <chuwiey> it's being created from scratch and saved to tmp
[08:04:06] <Jester86> chuwiey here let me show you what tmp contains right before you try to append it.
[08:04:17] <Shilon> hi
[08:04:57] <Jester86> chuwiey note what the <video> in the alert contains.  then look to see where I'm executing that alert.    http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/1/
[08:06:10] <Shilon> I have a header include, a content and a footer and I'm using AJAX loader, when I click on a link it clears all my other scripts… Any solutions or ideas?
[08:07:02] <chuwiey> Jester86: I totally understand that.. Just not sure why it's like that?
[08:08:24] <Jester86> chuwiey:  http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/2/
[08:08:32] <Jester86> You're welcome ;)
[08:09:08] <Jester86> chuwiey first off $(this).src does not exist.. this.src does
[08:09:21] <chuwiey> Jester86: thx! But I would love it if you could tell me why what I did, didn't work?
[08:10:15] <Jester86> chuwiey  b/c $(this).src / $(this).type is in correct
[08:10:33] <Jester86> it shoudl have been: this.src / this.type
[08:10:33] <chuwiey> how come?
[08:10:48] <Jester86> b/c the jquery object does not have .src property
[08:10:58] <Jester86> I believe its $(this).source.. not sure
[08:11:01] <Shilon> I have a php include of my header where I got my head tag with all scripts, a container and a footer and I'm using AJAX loader to load all pages inside the container, when I click on a link it clears all my other scripts… Any solutions or ideas?
[08:12:35] <chuwiey> Jester86: ohhhh! you are absolutely right. however, if you test it out on the console, it outputs the right thing. but you're right
[08:13:03] <Jester86> chuwiey it should be $(this).attr('src') / $(this).attr('type')
[08:14:06] <Jester86> chuwiey any time you run into that kind of thing just throw some alerts in there to make sure you're passing the data that you expect.
[08:14:23] <amph1bius> does anyone have any suggestions for a slider other than nivo? anything you'd like to suggest
[08:14:29] <chuwiey> Jester86: yeah, i did it in the console, and it looked right, so i was baffled… but thanks a lot!
[08:14:39] <Jester86> amph1bius jqueryUI?
[08:14:54] <amph1bius> jquery UI conflicts with bootstrap :S
[08:15:10] <amph1bius> i mean image slider
[08:15:22] <Jester86> chuwiey your console shoudln't have returned anything if you used $(this).. make sure you didn't use this
[08:16:14] <Jester86> amph1bius bootstrap has an image slider.. think its called carousel
[08:16:55] <Jester86> amph1bius: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel
[08:17:08] <chuwiey> Jester86: thx for your help, much appreciated
[08:17:14] <Jester86> no problem.
[08:17:33] <Jester86> chuwiey personally I would always recreate that source element though.
[08:17:46] <Jester86> I'd recreate and wipe out the existing.
[08:18:12] <Jester86> Its probably a little unncessary but has become a habit for me.
[08:18:25] <chuwiey> Jester86: remove() for the parent removes also the children
[08:19:32] <Shilon> I have a php include of my header where I got my head tag with all scripts, a container and a footer and I'm using AJAX loader to load all pages inside the container, when I click on a link it clears all my other scripts… Any solutions or ideas?
[08:19:52] <Jester86> chuwiey yeah sorry I kind of forgot you were putting the source attributes into the source tags contained within tmp
[08:20:10] <chuwiey> :)
[08:20:34] <Jester86> bouncing around too much.. helping people on here and researching angular
[08:23:02] <masentinel900> Someone know why the datepicker doesn't opens to first click?
[08:23:44] <masentinel900> I should to click the field, then click another field and by last click thedatepciker again and like this opens!!
[08:24:58] <thebag2> hi guys
[08:26:48] <thebag2> Any idea about why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/RjeUx/ nombre_producto get's printed on the console.log but it won't work when used as .val(nombre_producto);
[08:28:01] <talkr> I'm probably being really stupid but can anyone tell me why serialzie isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/kENXy/3/
[08:28:18] <chuwiey> Jester86: still doesn't work… :-\ when using $(this).attr('src') ...
[08:28:41] <thebag2> i've updated the fiddle with the full example http://jsfiddle.net/RjeUx/1/
[08:28:44] <Jester86> Hmm let me check that.. I just threw an alert in and it seemed to pull the correct data
[08:28:54] <thebag2> weird thing is that there aren't any errors on the console
[08:30:11] <Jester86> chuwiey what are you talking about willis: <video id="test_video" controls="controls" preload="preload"><source src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4" type="video/mp4"><source src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.ogv" type="video/ogg"></video>
[08:30:35] <Jester86> sorry.. not sure why it copied the alert and not the URL
[08:30:35] <amph1bius> oh html5 video, the bane of my existence 3 months ago
[08:30:45] <Jester86> http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/3/
[08:30:55] <chuwiey> Jester86: straight js works. jQuery didn't work for me…
[08:30:59] <Jester86> chuwiey  http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/3/
[08:31:21] <chuwiey> i can see that, but look at the video
[08:31:27] <Jester86> honestly if all you're doing is pulling the source I would likely use straight JS rather than making a jquery object
[08:31:42] <Jester86> chuwiey it works fine for me
[08:32:00] <Jester86> did you try the link I sent you?
[08:32:05] <Jester86> note I am using chrome
[08:32:11] <chuwiey> weird is all i can say… i did try it. (chrome here too)
[08:32:18] <chuwiey> but, i'll just use straight js i guess
[08:32:44] <Jester86> chuwiey do a ctrl + f5
[08:33:01] <chuwiey> i cleared cache..
[08:33:09] <Jester86> check otu that link i sent you..
[08:33:15] <Jester86> it should work there.
[08:33:16] <chuwiey> i did…
[08:33:35] <Jester86> http://jsfiddle.net/FX6dB/3/
[08:33:55] <Jester86> chuwiey what do you see in that alert?  Are all of the sources formatted correctly?
[08:34:20] <Jester86> All of my sources appear correct and function as they should.
[08:34:21] <talkr> nevermind re mine
[08:35:03] <chuwiey> Jester86: the initial issue and the reason why i'm doing this at all is because of iOS… do you have simulator installed?
[08:35:40] <Jester86> I have nothing.  I'm just operating off of my base OS.. not fired into a VM
[08:35:54] <Jester86> but I have nothing for iOS
[08:36:08] <chuwiey> ok.. oh well, thx for the help! appreciate it
[08:36:23] <Jester86> Like we were discussing earlier though.. I'd just use basic JS for something like that
[08:36:29] <Jester86> no sense in using jQ for that
[08:36:39] <chuwiey> that's what i've decided to do…
[08:36:39] <sunbeam> is it possible to use name="contract[date]"
[08:36:40] <chuwiey> thx
[08:36:49] <Jester86> no prob, good luck.
[08:36:52] <sunbeam> to supply an array when submitting several input fields that are related to each other?
[08:41:23] <thebag2> I managed to fix it, but still have a quesiton
[08:42:16] <thebag2> when I do $("input[name='nombre-producto']").val(nombre_producto); if I look at the source on my console, value is still empty. Visually I can see the change on front end. But I need that value when sending a form
[08:46:58] <thebag2> no?
[08:47:41] <lejocely1> I would like to serialize all the inputs data from a form so that it's sent to a php script as $_POST[$name], $name being the name of the input
[08:47:47] <lejocely1> I'm not sure how to do that
[08:47:56] <didiergm> thebag2 I am not sure you would see it on the html; as long as you see it on screen it will be submitted with the form
[08:48:20] <dan89> is there a way I could get a html select element to reference itself? Like if a dropdown is changed, it's on change event gets the value it was set to and does something with it? These elements are created dynamically within a loop
[08:48:26] <lejocely1> I thought var data = $(#my_form).serialize(); would do
[08:48:30] <lejocely1> but it seems not
[08:48:32] <thebag2> didiergm: hmm let me double check
[08:48:46] <djQuery> thebag2, console.log($("input[name='nombre-producto']").val(nombre_producto).closest('form').serialize());
[08:48:57] <djQuery> thebag2, whats that output?
[08:49:48] <thebag2> djQuery: nombre_producto is not defined :S
[08:50:54] <didiergm> lejocely1 what makes you say $('#myform').serialize()  does not work ?
[08:51:21] <lejocely1> didiergm: it works probably but it's not what I need :)
[08:51:42] <lejocely1> I don't know how to send the data of my form in a $.ajax()
[08:51:59] <thebag2> djQuery: now the output is empty
[08:52:17] <lejocely1> I've got quite a lot of inputs, I don't want to name them
[08:52:22] <didiergm> lejocely1 get the data by serialize() and send it via ajax in the data option
[08:52:23] <djQuery> lejocely1, well you would serialize the form then pass it as data in an ajax call
[08:52:23] <thebag2> djQuery: check it out http://jsfiddle.net/RjeUx/2/
[08:52:41] <lejocely1> djQuery: I'm not sure how to do that
[08:53:14] <lejocely1> $("#my_from).serialize() doesn't get anything
[08:54:06] <didiergm> lejocelyn see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/425095/submit-form-using-ajax-and-jquery & look at 1st answer
[08:54:28] <djQuery> lejocely1, then just use something that will do it for you http://www.malsup.com/jquery/form/#getting-started
[08:55:02] <djQuery> thebag2, well of course my example wouldn
[08:55:14] <djQuery> t do anything you dont have a form
[08:55:29] <thebag2> lol
[08:55:32] <thebag2> that's true
[08:55:42] <thebag2> just a sec, will try it on the actual form
[08:55:49] <djQuery>  so the .closest('form') aint gonna return anyting
[08:57:02] <thebag2> djQuery: Ok, i get a really weird string
[08:57:31] <thebag2> djQuery: I just need what's in h1 .titulo-producto
[08:58:16] <aro> what are you doing
[08:58:36] <thebag2> Im auto filling an input based on a title
[08:58:47] <aro> ok
[08:59:07] <djQuery> thebag2, also .prop('disabled', true);
[08:59:31] <thebag2> http://ladesign.cl/productos if you hover, and then click on get quote , the value is replaced, but it won't be send on the form
[08:59:58] <thebag2> djQuery: I should add that?
[09:00:36] <thebag2> *sent
[09:05:03] <thebag2> So basically, in the frontend I can see the value, but when I click send, it won't appear on my mail. Not sure if there's any way to fix that.
[09:13:08] <StephenS> one question: I have button manipulation, but on button submission form is submitted too, even if jquery is executed, why is that?
[09:13:32] <dan89> is there a way I can trigger a change for a hidden element?
[09:13:59] <StephenS> .show()
[09:14:10] <StephenS> display:none or hidden?
[09:14:19] <dan89> hidden
[09:14:34] <dan89> I've hidden an original drop down because I've created a new one dynamically
[09:14:59] <dan89> If any of my dynamic drop downs are changed I want it to update the selected value of the original drop down
[09:15:07] <dan89> which I can change the value but haven't figured out how to trigger it's onchange this way
[09:17:18] <spobat> is this the way before() should be used? http://ideone.com/GJVPb7
[09:17:30] <aro> what r u trying to do
[09:18:05] <spobat> oh, it's prev() I just see in the docs :S
[09:18:51] <spobat> I tried to get the element before it
[09:19:25] <Shilon> I have a php include of my header where I got my head tag with all scripts, a container and a footer and I'm using AJAX loader to load all pages inside the container, when I click on a link it clears all my other scripts… Any solutions or ideas?
[09:22:46] <thebag2> Ok, problem solver. Looks like if the input is disabled, the value won't be sent. Is this always like this? Is it possible to have a disabled input with a value, and the value to be sent over a form?
[09:22:50] <thebag2> *solved
[09:27:14] <BillCriswell> thebag2: No. If it's disabled it isn't sent.
[09:27:38] <BillCriswell> thebag2: Why is it disabled if you don't want to send it?
[09:28:32] <StephenS> Why is my form submitted/processed with action? however jquery is processed though\
[09:28:41] <StephenS> I just dont want to action="" process...?
[09:29:53] <thebag2> BillCriswell: so that the user can't change the value i've just pre-filled for him
[09:30:29] <BillCriswell> thebag2: sounds like you want readonly.
[09:30:41] <thebag2> aaaaaa
[09:30:46] <thebag2> yes
[09:31:28] <thebag2> you're absolutely right. wow, never had heard about that
[09:31:29] <MeXTuX> What is the best way to check if a jQuery object is read only ? if ($(this).is('[readonly]'))
[09:31:34] <thebag2> i feel ashamed lol
[09:31:56] <BillCriswell> thebag2: I still hear about things in HTML that I never heard of too.
[09:32:09] <thebag2> I was pulling my hair out!
[09:32:28] <BillCriswell> MeXTuX: That seems like the safest bet I could think of.
[09:33:06] <MeXTuX> BillCriswell: Thank you!
[09:33:16] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:33:49] <gordian> if anyone can help me with my scrollspy issue i'd really appreciate it
[09:34:03] <gordian> http://jsfiddle.net/AzSWV/2/
[09:34:08] <gordian> scrollspy works there flawlessly
[09:34:31] <gordian> but if you uncomment the CSS then the page requires horizontal scrolling
[09:34:32] <gordian> and it breaks the js
[09:35:19] <gordian> when you scroll horizontally and reach a page anchor then that page anchor's nav item should get the class 'active'
[09:35:19] <gordian> just as it does when scrolling vertically
[09:36:03] <thebag2> so that's how it's called "scroll spy"
[09:36:16] <gordian> advice/tips/hints/tricks much appreicated
[09:36:43] <gordian> well it's only spying in one direction
[09:36:49] <BillCriswell> thebag2: http://css-tricks.com/indeterminate-checkboxes/ I just learned of indeterminate checkboxes recently. Been in HTML a long ass time.
[09:37:02] <gordian> i've tweaked it trying to get it to spy horizontally but no luck
[09:37:18] <thebag2> gordian, i don't think it's supposed to work that way
[09:38:05] <thebag2> BillCriswell: oh, that's a good one to know about too.
[09:38:58] <thebag2> and a weird one
[09:39:18] <StephenS> whats wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/BuvEF/1/ ?
[09:39:31] <thebag2> gordian: check this out https://gist.github.com/marcoleong/1922743 :)
[09:39:33] <eugenio> ciao
[09:39:35] <StephenS> When I click on submit jquery is activated and form is hidden but redirected becaose of action=""
[09:39:42] <eugenio> !list
[09:40:05] <gordian> thebag2: already tried it, also no luck
[09:40:15] <thebag2> StephenS: your input isnt closed at the end.
[09:40:36] <StephenS> what do yo mena?
[09:40:40] <StephenS> <input />
[09:40:40] <StephenS> ?
[09:41:23] <StephenS> thebag2, ?
[09:41:41] <thebag2> yeah
[09:41:54] <StephenS> nah that is nt the issue
[09:41:57] <thebag2> then it works
[09:42:20] <StephenS> it works anyway, but form still reloads...
[09:42:22] <StephenS> it shouldnt

[09:42:57] <StephenS> here http://jsfiddle.net/BuvEF/3/ take a look at the action=""
[09:45:01] <thebag2> StephenS: hmm not sure what's going on there
[09:46:09] <danols_work_> Anyone got ECLIPSE autocompletion working for jquery ?
[09:46:21] <StephenS> no
[09:59:36] <spobat> is there a easy way to get the margin in pixels?
[09:59:53] <spobat> e.css('margin-left') returns "x px"
[10:00:01] <spobat> should I parseInt it?
[10:01:35] <spobat> yep, i'll do that I guess
[10:03:37] <rmill> spobat, that's the easiest way, yes.
[10:06:40] <Croves> Hey guys! I need help here. When the user click the left icon (arrow up), I need to get the amount input id. http://i.imgur.com/6LoJMmb.jpg
[10:06:57] <Croves> I'm trying this: $(this).parent().next('td').closest('input').attr('id');
[10:07:03] <Croves> But it's not woking!
[10:09:16] <JFranks> I've seen this done a lot, but it won't work for me?! $(document).ready(function(){ $("form").submit(); });
[10:09:42] <b-lew> Can I get some support on a beginner question… here is the question. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15767582/rearrange-html-in-js
[10:25:15] <danols_work_> wow I"m a newb, ok I want to select all links and attach an event to them the following does not work, but I seem to be getting the elements at least: $('#lawyerlisting_set .icon-mail-send').click(function(){alert('test');})
[10:25:20] <danols_work_> what am I missing ?
[10:38:42] <Sendoushi> hey guys. here goes a question. I have posts/information inside an array. I want to load the first let's say 10 posts and then get a plus button on the bottom to load more. All these have an image so it's really hard to load lets say 100 images. I know I can use AJAX for this but... how do I pass "hey get me here the next 10 posts" ?
[10:40:04] <spobat> hell yeah
[10:40:05] <spobat> $('#add-new-room-popover > div:nth-child(2) ul > li > a:contains("' + name + '")')
[10:40:19] <spobat> longest query i ever had :}
[10:40:52] <konr> where should I put jquery mobile's 'images/' folder? in the document's root? under 'css/'?
[10:43:25] <JFranks> In the case of a form with radios in it.. how would you use jQuery to get the state of the radios? .. When you submit such a form "sSex" = whichever of the two is selected in the $_POST(); nut I want to submit to another form before the real submit goes off..
[10:43:31] <JFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/
[10:46:38] <konr> actually it is in css, but jquery-mobile is asking for a non-existing file, "ui-icons_222222_256x240.png".  The files I've got here are icons-{18,36}-{black,white}.png - any idea on what's going on? Do I have to install anything else besides or configure something in the server?
[10:48:54] <JFranks> $('input[name=sSex]:radio').value is undefined.. $('input[name=sSex]:radio').val is a heap of fun but I don't see the selection choice.. http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/5/
[10:54:43] <Adys> am I missing something here? http://i.imgur.com/mTpoKfx.png
[10:56:09] <dotDeeka> JFranks: Something like this http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/11/ perhaps
[10:57:15] <djQuery> dotDeeka, by the way it still shows in opera
[10:57:17] <JFranks> dotDeeka: Aha! I was getting close (http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/12/) .. Thanks!
[10:57:21] <maxwell_> Adys:  the " ; "
[10:57:37] <Adys> maxwell_: hilarious
[10:58:16] <maxwell_> Adys:  also you should use val() instead html() i guess
[10:58:34] <Adys> Why, does val() somehow return the html content of the element?
[10:58:36] <djQuery> JFranks, var v = $('input[name=sSex]:radio').val()
[10:58:47] <dotDeeka> JFranks: No problem
[10:58:47] <diamonds> hep me
[10:59:09] <diamonds> I have a site running jquery 1.3 on part of it (yes it's old) and I'm debugging in IE8
[10:59:35] <diamonds> I cannot seem to get the console to ouput the DOM elem itself
[10:59:45] <maxwell_> Adys:  because the value is entered as html
[11:00:02] <djQuery> diamonds, ie will throw on error on console unless the console is actualy open
[11:00:04] <Adys> maxwell_: what are you on about? I don't want the value, I want the html ...
[11:00:10] <djQuery> do you have the dev tools installed in ie
[11:00:14] <diamonds> djQuery: thanks, it's open
[11:00:27] <diamonds> djQuery: not sure... IE8 comes with its own console tho
[11:00:28] <Adys> maxwell_: why's .html() returning an empty string here?
[11:00:33] <diamonds> djQuery: link?
[11:00:40] <djQuery> diamonds, its been a while since I used ie
[11:01:02] <djQuery> diamonds, if you want the element itself $('.selector')[0]
[11:01:10] <konr> Jquery-mobile is asking for a non-existing file, "ui-icons_222222_256x240.png".  The files I've got here are icons-{18,36}-{black,white}.png - any idea on what's going on? Do I have to install anything else besides or configure something in the server?
[11:01:12] <djQuery> that will get jus the element
[11:01:15] <diamonds> ok I was using get(0)
[11:01:22] <djQuery> well the first element
[11:01:41] <djQuery> .get(0) will still return a jquery object
[11:01:59] <djQuery> diamonds, what do you want to do with it once u got it?
[11:02:25] <diamonds> djQuery: are you sure? http://api.jquery.com/get/
[11:02:31] <diamonds> I think it returns the DOM elem itself
[11:02:39] <djQuery> konr, there was a bug with the download builder that I think is fixed now where it wasn't gettting all the images
[11:04:24] <djQuery> diamonds, well I gues they are the same http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/rwJVM/15/
[11:06:11] <djQuery> diamonds, I was thinking that .get() returns an array
[11:06:29] <diamonds> if you have more than one elem, yes
[11:06:38] <diamonds> and you don't specify an index
[11:06:45] <diamonds> or just the latter
[11:06:59] <diamonds> ANYWAY my issue is .get(0) returns {...} in ie debugger
[11:07:16] <diamonds> and JSON.stringify($foo.get(0)) returns `undefined`
[11:07:21] <djQuery> diamonds, did you try that link I sent you?
[11:07:22] <diamonds> so basically news flash IE suxxorz
[11:07:24] <djQuery> in ie
[11:07:30] <diamonds> the fiddle?
[11:07:33] <djQuery> yes
[11:07:41] <diamonds> 1 sec, not it IE
[11:08:20] <diamonds> I don't think fiddle works in ie8 http://screencast.com/t/XyuWecee
[11:08:51] <djQuery> diamonds, close out the error open console then refresh
[11:08:54] <diamonds> "// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.4.0" > bug
[11:09:05] <djQuery> ie doesnt support console
[11:09:35] <diamonds> not sure what you mean... console.log works fine in ie
[11:09:43] <diamonds> (as long as console is open, else it crashes)
[11:09:50] <djQuery> not unless console is actualy open
[11:10:28] <djQuery> oh well what if you try with a newer version of jquery or with [] instead of get
[11:11:32] <djQuery> wish the jquery api page had a link to the source for each item
[11:12:22] <pachet> that'd be neat
[11:13:26] <djQuery> diamonds, but basicaly .get(somenum) just does [somenum]
[11:14:39] <djQuery> pachet, should I submit a feature request
[11:15:25] <diamonds> jsfiddle seems fully nonfunctional in IE8
[11:16:34] <shoky> diamonds:  add /show to your fiddle url if you wanna test it in IE8
[11:16:46] <diamonds> shoky: ty
[11:17:27] <diamonds> wow it's crashing my browser :p
[11:17:46] <diamonds> (jsfiddle.net/ homepage ie8)
[11:17:48] <djQuery> diamonds, how about jsbin instead http://jsbin.com/edocux/1/edit
[11:18:07] <Woet> or not using IE8 in the first place :)
[11:19:01] <djQuery> Woet, yes IE 6 was the best   http://saveie6.com
[11:19:21] <djQuery> http://saveie6.com/download1.php
[11:19:24] <diamonds> argh
[11:19:45] <diamonds> I get object HTMLInputElement, JSON.stringify doesn't work on it, and Object.keys doesn't exist
[11:19:50] * diamonds shakes fist
[11:19:53] <diamonds> IE!!!!!!
[11:21:01] <JFranks> Hmmm just had an april fools plugin idea.. Make a manifest for a chrome plugin, have it load jquery from CDN, then have it add a trigger to all elements on the page for onMouseOver that grabs an element at random from the page and does an append() to the current element the mouse has triggered.. ?
[11:21:47] <djQuery> JFranks, just make sure the image isn't from lemonparty.com
[11:22:42] <JFranks> djQuery: Neah it'd be from the current document.. $(this).append($(random.selected.element));  ?
[11:23:15] <JFranks> Basically the more you move the mouse, the more the page barfs itself all over..
[11:23:32] <djQuery> JFranks, boght one of those dongles that goes inline with the keyboard that makes the keyboard spit out random characters instea of the typed character
[11:24:05] <djQuery> wish it came with a remote to disable it for when they call IT over though
[11:25:11] <JFranks> Be better if it knew the adjacent keys and picked one..
[11:25:21] <JFranks> "My fingers are not working!!"
[11:26:05] <JFranks> And now I have a second idea for a April Fools Chrome plugin..
[11:26:09] <tdignan> strangest thing. calling submit() on my form has no effect
[11:26:15] <tdignan> any troubleshooting ideas
[11:26:34] <djQuery> tdignan, would help if you had a deo
[11:26:36] <djQuery> demo
[11:26:52] <djQuery> ?demo@tdignan
[11:26:52] <bot-t> tdignan, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:26:58] <JFranks> tdignan: Ditto! .. I was smacking my head against the keyboard when 8 emails came in saying I'd submitted 8 tests.. Apparently it doesn't return the submit result?!
[11:27:34] <djQuery> tdignan, $(
[11:27:51] <tdignan> djQuery: yeah, i am using it.
[11:27:52] <djQuery> $('#myform').trigger('submit');
[11:28:00] <tdignan> I just used $(this.form)
[11:28:10] <tdignan> since it's in a change callback.
[11:28:21] <JFranks> I'd expect .submit() to behave the same as a user clicking the button..
[11:28:29] <tdignan> unfortunately the issue would take way too long to write a test case for. I was just hoping for some general troubleshooting ideas.
[11:28:34] <JFranks> I did NOT try 'trigger('submit')' !
[11:28:44] <djQuery> tdignan, console.log(this.form.nodeName);
[11:29:35] <tdignan> djQuery: FORM
[11:29:39] <tdignan> is what it prints
[11:29:55] <djQuery> tdignan, cool I thought it would just return the string
[11:30:23] <tdignan> it prints the whole form out nice in web inspector if you just do console.log(this.form)
[11:30:31] <djQuery> hadn't worked with <input form="whatever"> yet
[11:30:51] <djQuery> $(this.form).trigger('submit')
[11:31:10] <SheikPunk> hello guys!
[11:31:13] <SheikPunk> so… I'm using persistencejs to store my offline data. i have a sync method to get a json via AJAX. check out please: http://pastie.org/7282553 but on line 14 i got an error, because the var "data" not is in the callback scope.
[11:35:41] <tdignan> djQuery: if I bind a handler to the form's submit event, the handler does fire.
[11:35:49] <tdignan> I need the browser's default behavior to run, though
[11:35:53] <tdignan> I want a normal submit :|
[11:36:20] <tdignan> returning true from said handler didn't help. I wonder if event.preventDefault() is getting called, but I don't understand how many submit handlers can be bound -- is it one or many?
[11:40:05] <shoky> tdignan:  what about this.form.submit()
[11:40:26] <shoky> also what about $(this).closest('form').submit()
[11:40:42] <velts> is there an array shuffle for jquery?
[11:41:00] <shoky> velts: nope
[11:41:15] <tdignan> shoky: no, those are all the same way of doing what I'm doing. They're equivalent. The problem lies in the actual form being submitted -- as I said, I bound a submit handler to it, and it fired when I triggered the event.
[11:41:22] <tdignan> this is so weird.
[11:41:28] <tdignan> I wonder if some crap I included is breaking it
[11:41:40] <shoky> tdignan: does that mean you tried what i said, or haven't tried it?
[11:41:48] <tdignan> shoky: yeah, i tried it before you suggested it.
[11:41:54] <shoky> k
[11:42:07] <tdignan> they're exact equivalents :)
[11:42:08] <SheikPunk> I'm using persistencejs to store my offline data. i have a sync method to get a json via AJAX. check out please: http://pastie.org/7282553 but on line 14 i got an error, because the var "data" not is in the callback scope.
[11:42:12] <shoky> tdignan: not exact, no
[11:42:31] <tdignan> shoky: when there is only one form on the page, they are, but all are inferior to simply referencing the form variable from $(this.form)
[11:42:55] <shoky> this.form is the form
[11:43:14] <tdignan> yes, so why bother using a traversal like closest() to find the form when the form is already at this.form
[11:43:56] <shoky> the .closest() is equivalent, yeah
[11:45:27] <velts> what is .closest() the equivalent too?
[11:45:52] <daslicht> is there somesthing like this availabel fro cursors?
[11:45:52] <daslicht> http://aino.github.com/throbber.js/
[11:45:56] <shoky> $(this).closest('form') is equivalent to $(this.form)
[11:46:04] <shoky> was the meaning
[11:46:08] <daslicht> I like to indicate loading with a spinning thobber cursor
[11:50:41] <Francis47> can someone tell me why this: http://jsfiddle.net/c8YSk/1/ doesnt work in IE ?
[11:51:06] <velts> what version of IE?
[11:51:13] <Francis47> both 8 and 9
[11:51:36] <shadyKhan> what is the difference between == and === in an operator?
[11:52:17] <velts> Francis47: try alerting the threshold
[11:53:27] <velts> shadyKhan: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/javascript-vs-does-it-matter-which-equal-operator-i-use
[11:53:37] <aep> anyone knows a scrollbar replacement? jscrollbar is not very relyable
[11:53:53] <aep> s/ a / a decent/
[11:55:05] <velts> aep: are you trying to support all browsers?
[11:56:12] <velts> if you taking a progressive enchanement approach I would just style the scroll bar with css in webkit browsers only.. https://www.webkit.org/blog/363/styling-scrollbars/
[11:56:15] <aep> velts: yep
[11:56:30] <aep> yeah i want it to degrade to a regular scrollbar
[11:56:41] <aep> hm maybe thats good enough, thanks
[11:56:41] <daslicht> anyone know how to create a spinning cursor ?
[11:56:53] <SheikPunk> hello
[11:57:00] <SheikPunk> somebody can help me?
[11:57:00] <velts> i try to avoid javasript libs for custom scrollbars
[11:57:05] <SheikPunk> I'm using persistencejs to store my offline data. i have a sync method to get a json via AJAX. check out please: http://pastie.org/7282553 but on line 14 i got an error, because the var "data" not is in the callback scope.
[11:57:09] <velts> add so much extra weight
[11:57:13] <aep> velts: yeah, it doesn't feel good at all :/
[11:57:18] <aep> when using it
[11:57:29] <velts> but i head jScrollPane is ok
[11:57:32] <velts> hear
[11:57:40] <aep> nop. lots of broken cases
[11:57:52] <velts> so personally, i would just style it with css in browsers that support it
[11:57:54] <shoky> Francis47:  use $(window).scrollTop()   not window.scrollY
[11:58:05] <aep> workarounds are already 40 lines long, and i'm probably missing tons of browser dependant problems
[11:58:22] <JFranks> Hmmm how does a trigger like: $('form').submit(function() {}); ... avoid a loop with $('form').trigger('submit'); .. ?
[11:58:51] <JFranks> Seems like it *should* loop.. which would suck.
[11:59:06] <velts> JFranks: what do you mean should loop?
[11:59:31] <velts> are you saying when you trigger a submit, your submit callback funtion is never being executed?
[11:59:54] <xec> JFranks: is the trigger inside the handler?
[12:02:01] <xec> JFranks: you could send some data with the trigger()'s second param, something like $().submit(function(e, isTriggered){ if (!isTriggered)  { $().trigger("submit", true); } })
[12:02:12] <JFranks> Neah I'm saying I don't want the submit button to send the form right away.. it actually calls on AJAX to push the form values to another form, and then when that returns a response, do the $('form').trigger('submit');
[12:02:46] <JFranks> But I'm expecting a loop? (about to try it live)
[12:02:59] <aep> velts: so much better, thanks :)
[12:03:00] <Francis47> shoky: + that worked perfectly
[12:03:06] <Francis47> thanks
[12:03:30] <JFranks> But if the trigger is inside the handler it's safe?
[12:03:51] <velts> JFranks: I am confused with what you are asking, could you provide a code sample?
[12:04:14] <xec> JFranks: i was assuming that's what you had (since you were worried about a loop)
[12:04:21] <xec> JFranks: so, no
[12:05:27] <velts> SheikPunk: i would possible try just create another variable about var search, var d = data[i]; and in search.count use d.code and d.name
[12:05:33] <velts> about = above
[12:06:11] <JFranks> http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/22/
[12:06:14] <SheikPunk> velte don't work because the callback can't see my scope… outside
[12:06:36] <velts> its not getting into the success function?
[12:07:24] <SheikPunk> velts no.
[12:07:43] <aep> now, if there only was a decent tree widget. extjs is awesome, but the price is intense
[12:07:48] <SheikPunk> this callback is asynchronous.
[12:08:10] <JFranks> ^^ to me, technically, that function is called from the trigger/handler.. so it may not loop?
[12:08:33] <velts> aep: http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/ ??
[12:08:54] <JFranks> But I could copy-paste it into the handler function area?
[12:09:12] <velts> SheikPunk: add an error function and log out the error you are getting
[12:09:14] <aep> velts: forgot to mention i need drag and drop
[12:10:33] <velts> aep: that lib is actually deprecated now, suppose to use http://www.jstree.com/ now
[12:10:44] <aep> yeah that one has too many bugs
[12:10:50] <velts> haha
[12:10:55] <aep> actually only really works in chrome
[12:11:30] <aep> maybe i'll have to roll my own :(   jquery hopefully has enough Dnd Primitves
[12:11:43] <velts> yah, shouldnt be to hard
[12:12:03] <velts> JFranks: what isnt working, everything looks ok in your example to me?
[12:13:01] <xec> JFranks: http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/27/
[12:13:14] <aep> how would i implement a selection model to reuse as much browser stuff as possible? invisible check boxes?
[12:13:35] <aep> like, i want to avoid implementing custom keyhandlers and stuff (jsquery did, and its terrible)
[12:14:32] <xec> JFranks: actually this is better for demonstration: http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/28/
[12:14:50] <velts> xec: your code would not work and could run into race conditions
[12:15:05] <xec> JFranks: the settimeout is just to simulate the delay of ajax
[12:15:10] <xec> velts: how so?
[12:15:19] <velts> thats a horrible idea, sorry to say
[12:15:38] <xec> velts: okay, please elaborate?
[12:15:45] <velts> you could submit the form before the ajax request is completed
[12:15:57] <xec> how
[12:16:24] <xec> isTriggered will always be falsy when the native submit is triggered
[12:16:26] <velts> because you are submitting the form after 1 second
[12:16:50] <xec> velts: ...
[12:16:57] <velts> where is isTriggered defined? and when does it ever get set to true?
[12:17:08] <shoky> $('form').trigger("submit", true);
[12:17:14] <xec> velts: read the docs for .trigger() - i'm passing it as second argument
[12:17:25] <velts> right, i missed that part
[12:17:28] <xec> hi shoky :)
[12:17:32] <shoky> hey ;p
[12:17:46] <velts> i still do not see how the form will be submitting after the ajax request returns?
[12:17:54] <shoky> even without that isTriggered
[12:18:01] <shoky> it still wouldn't loop MUCH
[12:18:11] <shoky> once the form is submitted, new page plz
[12:18:18] <shoky> ajax requests go byebye
[12:18:27] <shoky> so what if there is another submit scheduled for later
[12:18:36] <shoky> it's all async anyway
[12:19:12] <xec> shoky: i'm assuming the ajax isnt for posting but for validation and he wants the form to actually submit (and browser to reload etc)
[12:19:52] <shoky> well, yeah. and once it submits, there would be no looping anyway
[12:20:22] <xec> shoky: but you'd need to prevent the first submit and wait for the validator
[12:20:39] <shoky> right, just like in JFranks' fiddle
[12:21:33] <xec> JFranks' fiddle is /22 and would loop and never submit
[12:21:58] <shoky> right, scratch that,
[12:22:33] <shoky> i was tryin to make a diff point anyway, to velts, nevermind
[12:22:44] <xec> xD
[12:22:53] * xec sits on shoky
[12:23:20] * shoky flattens
[12:23:23] <velts> i might be missing something
[12:23:23] <xec> unfortunately for you, i've been gaining weight lately ;)
[12:23:30] <shoky> heehee
[12:23:41] <velts> this is how i would do what i think he is trying to do

[12:23:54] <shoky> velts xec's points were all valid, you can ignore mine
[12:24:35] <velts> the only thing my code is missing is the logic so the form doesnt get submitting multiple times, there are  abunch of ways to do that
[12:24:37] <xec> velts: what would happen when the ajax callback triggers .submit() ? the sendform_a would be called again and submit canceled
[12:25:03] <xec> velts: well... right... that's exactly what my code solved :P
[12:25:15] <velts> ohhh, i now get his problem!
[12:25:16] <velts> lol
[12:25:24] <xec> hehe
[12:25:32] <velts> the "looping", i didnt get what he was saying
[12:26:53] <velts> sorry, was confused :P
[12:29:50] <shoky> xec btw i was just thinking of this scenario- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/rwJVM/32/
[12:30:02] <shoky> i think :\
[12:30:11] <velts> http://jsfiddle.net/rwJVM/31/
[12:31:14] <velts> only thing i do not get what he was wondering is what "set trigger for ajax response" means
[12:32:55] <shoky> probably just what you did in the success callback
[12:32:58] <shoky> but uh
[12:33:04] <shoky>  $form.submit("submit");  what's that about
[12:33:27] <velts> typo
[12:33:33] <shoky> KOOL

[12:46:42] <guideX> using fancybox, why does IE pickup a different height than other browsers with this code? www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39308
[12:47:09] <guideX> for ie "jQuery(this).contents().find('html').height()" is 370, for other browsers it's 536
[12:48:33] <fonko> what would this be for? $('#someDiv').off('click').on('click', function() {})
[12:49:20] <velts> fonko: probably making sure there is not other click event assigned to someDiv before firing a click event
[12:49:32] <fonko> cool thanks
[12:49:40] <velts> bad form imo
[12:50:06] <velts> guideX: cause IE is not a good browser
[12:50:09] <guideX> well yeah
[12:50:18] <guideX> but, how do I workaround this terrible browser in this case
[12:50:24] <velts> heh
[12:50:36] <guideX> i'm open to ugly hacks and terrible workarounds :)(
[12:50:42] <velts> so are you trying to get the height of the document?
[12:50:49] <guideX> yeah
[12:51:23] <guideX> it may be picking up the wrong "this" i'm not sure
[12:51:27] <fonko> velts, because im loading an iframe from a picture and when i click a div that moves a slide (with off(click).on('click') ) i lost youtube player (expected) then get the image again but it doesnt have the click property again :(
[12:51:54] <velts> you could always just use $(window)
[12:52:33] <fonko> velts, despite i load the "html" of the image with the href attr $("#content_home").find("#slides").find("ul").find("li:first").next().next().html(image_html);
[12:52:51] <guideX> I think $(window) is the whole document, I'm sorry I mean, i'm trying to get the height of the popup
[12:52:56] <velts> i think $(window).height()  works in ie too
[12:53:05] <guideX> it works, but I get the main window, not the popup
[12:53:37] <velts> howdo you open your popup?
[12:54:04] <guideX> when you click, it hits the "jQuery("a.quickview").click(function(event) {" code
[12:54:14] <guideX> then goes through the fancybox stuff
[12:54:29] <velts> yah i want to see in the click callback
[12:54:35] <velts> poste it on jsbin
[12:54:41] <guideX> hmm ok
[12:55:57] <velts> fonko: best way to get help is isolate your code and post it to jsbin
[12:56:10] <velts> sorry, jsfiddle

[13:21:36] <ries> hello! I can use  p + ul to find all UL's before a p element, is it also possible to find all UL's before a element that is not p?
[13:23:53] <ries> not! :D
[13:24:13] <shoky> isn't that all ul's AFTER a p element?
[13:25:03] <vernonk> Actually, I think that's an adjacent selector only selecting the ul directly after a p
[13:26:38] <[1]fonko> how do i gain "click" capabilities again??? i have this $('#slides .slidesIframe').off('click').on('click', function() {
[13:26:56] <[1]fonko> but after that i am not able to click again my slides .slidesIframes :(
[13:27:19] <shoky> ries: anyway there's :not(...)
[13:27:32] <shoky> e.g. :not(p) + ul
[13:27:45] <ries> shoky: yes indeed.. I just tested it and that works
[13:27:55] <ries> ul + :not℗ also works
[13:28:39] <shoky> 2 different things

[13:32:06] <DukeDrake> hi
[13:32:55] <DukeDrake> does same origin policy for ajax mean, the target of an ajax request must be the same domain .... or even the same subdomain?
[13:33:58] <vernonk> same domain, but not same subdomian.  You can set up a whitelist cross domain policy though.
[13:34:20] <vernonk> by that I mean, no request from domain.com to sub.domain.com
[13:35:18] <DukeDrake> ah
[13:35:18] <ilteris_> anyone?
[13:35:29] <DukeDrake> but vom sub1.domain.com to sub2.domain.com ?
[13:38:08] <vernonk> No, that will be blocked too.  If it's your domain though, you can always setup a cross-domain policy from both subdomains. Here's a simple walkthrough: https://support.ookla.com/entries/21097566-What-is-crossdomain-xml-and-why-do-I-need-it-
[13:39:08] <DukeDrake> what did "but not same subdomain" mean?
[13:39:26] <DukeDrake> thanx for the link
[13:39:59] <vernonk> So if you are on sub1.dom.com you can make a request to data served from sub1.dom.com but not sub2.dom.com. To do that, you can set up a cross-domain policy to allow access.
[13:40:00] <vernonk> yep
[13:40:29] <DukeDrake> >.>
[13:40:41] <DukeDrake> the cross domain policy thing is nifty ^^
[13:40:47] <maxwell_> damn psg
[13:41:15] <DukeDrake> I should have known that a month ago XD
[13:41:35] <chrispercol> hi guys, is it possible for me to include a js file and get the value of id into my included file ie. myscript.js?id=123? thanks
[13:41:50] <vernonk> haha… Definitely cool.
[13:42:20] <daslicht> anyone know a biutton like this: http://jsfiddle.net/brennan/mcYKE/2/ but without bootstrap dependencies ?
[13:42:50] <vernonk> I can understand… sometimes it seems like we find out what we needed to know only after we've crafted this other strange solution.  ;)
[13:43:36] <ansikt> chrispercol: do it in a script tag, then reference the var from your js file
[13:43:43] <DukeDrake> vernonk: yupp. But now I know how to use curl etc..... not too bad either ^^
[13:43:58] <vernonk> True, true.
[13:44:41] <ilteris_> can someone be kind enough to help this n00b please? http://jsfiddle.net/3G8tH/71/
[13:44:57] <chrispercol> ansikt: so simple...should have thought of that, was fiddling with document.referrer...cheers
[13:45:04] <ilteris_> all I am trying to do is show/hide the content on the right side based on click from the left side.
[13:45:39] <anew> i'm using jquery.cycle
[13:45:42] <anew> to cycle thru images on hover
[13:45:54] <anew> the problem is i have like 30 images on the page and then each one has 2-4 images to go thru
[13:45:58] <anew> = loading like 120 images
[13:46:08] <anew> any ideas on what i can do to speed up page load time ?
[13:46:33] <vernonk> lazy load the images
[13:46:50] <vernonk> Not sure how that would work with the cyle plugin though.
[13:46:54] <anew> yeah
[13:47:03] <anew> i'm wondering if having he plugin is worth it
[13:47:14] <vernonk> Ideally, you could have a total number and then when  you get 3 away from the end you could load 3 more in.
[13:47:33] <vernonk> Are you doing a crossfade of the images or one of the more complex animations?
[13:47:36] <anew> what do u mean total number
[13:47:42] <anew> no just an easy one
[13:47:44] <ansikt> If you're using malsup's plugin, it does support lazy loading.
[13:47:44] <anew> hover and cycle
[13:47:50] <vernonk> there you go.
[13:47:51] <anew> o rly
[13:47:55] <ansikt> There's a tutorial for it on his page...
[13:47:56] <anew> i have to go hceck that out again
[13:47:59] <anew> thanks ansikt
[13:48:05] <ansikt> are you using cycle2 or just cycle?
[13:48:14] <anew> oh that is the one i'm using
[13:48:18] <vernonk> http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/progressive.php
[13:48:18] <anew> not sure if it's cycle2 or cycle tho
[13:48:38] <anew> what's the difference? one is newer ?
[13:48:41] <mg983> Can anyone help me out — http://bit.ly/XbHQe9 works fine with chrome, but if you use firefox and scroll down about half way down the list and try to drag from the left side to the right side it doesn't work as expected… Thanks!
[13:49:25] <vernonk> Cycle2 is newer and includes some nice improvements over the original.
[13:49:33] <vernonk> If you have the choice, move to Cycle2
[13:50:19] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: updated your fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/3G8tH/72/
[13:50:53] <ilteris_> wow Andrew_R! thanks a lot!!
[13:50:53] <ansikt> Cycle2's pretty nice, most configuration can be done with data-* attributes.
[13:51:28] <ansikt> Andrew_R:  Ever lived in Minnesota?
[13:51:34] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: one thing, how can I make it so when the page loads only research1 is visible? can I just hide the rest in the css?
[13:51:37] <vernonk> That sweet.  Nothing like data attributes.
[13:51:45] <Andrew_R> ansikt: I live in Minnesota
[13:52:00] <ansikt> Andrew_R:  Ever worked for a checking company?
[13:52:06] <mg983> uh oh!
[13:52:47] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: yes, just set display: none; on the other divs
[13:52:48] <anew> i dont see why i couldnt move to cycle2 as long as it's not a ton of changes i have to make
[13:53:06] <Andrew_R> ansikt: yeah I did
[13:53:09] <ansikt> anew:  It may be.  If you have to migrate a whole site, it may not be entirely worth it.
[13:53:30] <vernonk> anew what doctype are you using? HTML5 right?
[13:53:53] <ansikt> Andrew_R:  Haha, holy crap.  I joined slightly after you left, and sit in your cube.  Small world.
[13:53:54] <anew> bleh
[13:55:10] <Andrew_R> ansikt: haha that's funny, what made you ask if that was me? Just the @mpls.qwest part of my username?
[13:56:36] <ansikt> Andrew_R:  That, Eric always refers to you as "Andrew R."  I mean, how many web devs with that name living in MN could there be?
[13:56:43] <steve2013> Hi, I am trying to make jquery accordian work as per my needs but somehow its not working. I am trying to use it for unordered list. I have nested list structure as here http://jsfiddle.net/c8Qpu/ I dont want the extra space that comes when you drop the 2nd menu in the fiddle. I know it comes as it drops an equal amount of space as it does for the 1st menu. How do I avoid this? I dont need any extra space. Please help
[13:57:25] <Andrew_R> :) that's funny
[13:58:24] <vernonk> steve2013 updated your fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/c8Qpu/1/
[13:58:54] <vernonk> Check out the heightStyle option for the accordion: http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-heightStyle
[13:59:03] <mg983> Anyone ..??!?
[13:59:16] <mg983> http://bit.ly/XbHQe9 works fine with chrome, but if you use firefox and scroll down about half way down the list and try to drag from the left side to the right side it doesn't work as expected… Thanks!
[13:59:34] <steve2013> vernonk, thanks! I missed it I guess. I will read the documentation again :)
[13:59:56] <vernonk> steve2013 no worries man.  Just wanted to be sure you had a reference point if you wanted to look into it more.
[14:01:14] <vernonk> mg983 what is the "unexpected"?  I looked at it in Firefox and it seems to work if I'm deliberate about the drop area.  If I'm just throwing the items over though it doesn't drop and goes back to the list but in a really weird spot.  Is that your "unexpected"?
[14:01:18] <steve2013> vernonk, yes, I am pretty new to jquery and web dev in general! Lots to learn :)
[14:01:34] <mg983> vernonk yes it is
[14:01:52] <vernonk> steve2013 very cool.  Welcome aboard!
[14:03:59] <Andrew_R> ansikt: I hope you're not working on the same stuff I was when I was there :)
[14:06:08] <PeterThoeny> newbie question: how can i get the jquery object of the current html tag? for example, to add yellow background to the current table cell: (this).parent().css('background-color', '#ffa') - how do i get "this", without adding an id to the html tag?
[14:06:20] <amatecha> $(html) ?
[14:06:23] <amatecha> heh
[14:06:37] <amatecha> you can explicitly select any HTML tag
[14:06:44] <amatecha> oh, sorry
[14:07:19] <amatecha> you can indeed just do $(this)
[14:07:27] <amatecha> although it depends, it would help to see surrounding code
[14:08:16] <PeterThoeny> amatecha: i tried $(this), but it does not work unless you start from another jquery object or event
[14:09:33] <vernonk> Are you actually wanting a reference to the html element itself?  If so, $('html').  I don't think that's what you want though because your chain then goes to the parent() which wouldn't make sense.
[14:10:00] <amatecha> yeah, usage of "this" entirely depends on your current context...
[14:10:11] <PeterThoeny> vernonk: thanks, let me try
[14:10:36] <amatecha> no Peter it's not what you want
[14:10:52] <amatecha> you want to change the bg color of a specific piece of content, right?  not the entire page...
[14:11:13] <amatecha> regardless, it should be very easy to answer  if you can provide a bigger chunk of code (such as, your function)
[14:11:55] <vernonk> Right… that's why I mentioned the chaining piece.  Like amatecha mentions, a bigger chunk of code would definitely help.
[14:12:28] <amatecha> yeah like, what you may want to do is, when you create that table cell, assign it to a variable or such
[14:12:34] <amatecha> then you can refer to it via that variable
[14:12:53] <amatecha> var currentcell = $('.blah').append("my content blah blah");
[14:13:02] <amatecha> (or whatever.... it entirely depends on waht you're doing haha)
[14:13:40] <mg983> vernonk: do you know how I can fix the issue I am having?
[14:14:00] <vernonk> mg983 sorry, I've been looking at it but haven't been able to track it down.
[14:14:12] <mg983> vernonk: no worries thanks a ton!
[14:15:59] <vernonk> mg983 did you change anything just recently?
[14:16:13] <mg983> vernonk: no sir
[14:16:55] <vernonk> mg983 strange. I'm not able to recreate it now.
[14:17:03] <mg983> ha, no way?
[14:17:05] <mg983> are you using FF?
[14:17:08] <PeterThoeny> ok, here is a reduced example: http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Sandbox/JQueryTest
[14:17:27] <vernonk> mg983 sure am
[14:17:30] <PeterThoeny> i have a twiki table using | cell | cell | syntax |
[14:17:32] <mg983> vernonk: you have to scroll down a piece
[14:17:37] <PeterThoeny> which gets rendered into html
[14:17:45] <mg983> vernonk: I just checked the git logs, nothing has changed
[14:17:55] <PeterThoeny> the top right cell works using an id reference
[14:17:55] <mg983> vernonk: hmm I'm still getting it
[14:18:05] <vernonk> mg983 I'll look a bit more.
[14:18:08] <PeterThoeny> i'd like to do this without an id in any cell
[14:18:08] <mg983> ok thaknks
[14:18:10] <mg983> *thanks
[14:18:55] <PeterThoeny> do a "raw view" on the topic, login as "TWikiGuest" using pwd "guest" (both case sensitive)
[14:20:19] <ilteris_> hey Andrew_R, for some reason everything works on jsfiddle but not on my site :( http://klaweht.com/smrxt/v2dev/index.php
[14:20:58] <ilteris_> when I click a link, the text disappears. it somehow got set display:none
[14:21:01] <ilteris_> not sure whyh
[14:21:23] <FlowState> i have some code where i'm updating a table of draggable rows.  Do I need to destroy draggable on the existing rows before intializing draggable again?
[14:22:06] <FlowState> i guess i'm basically asking if the existing draggable handlers are being destroyed
[14:22:29] <ilteris_> Andrew_R: exact same code works like a charm here: http://jsfiddle.net/3G8tH/74/
[14:23:23] <Andrew_R> ilteris_: I had made a change to the A tags that you didn't notice.
[14:23:42] <ilteris_> ah!
[14:23:58] <ilteris_> I am not only a moron but a blind one.
[14:24:00] <ilteris_> thanks Andrew_R
[14:24:17] <Andrew_R> haha no problem, if you can't change the href and add the data-hash attribute, you could use $(this).attr('href') instead of $(this).data('hash')
[14:24:58] <Andrew_R> I don't like to use href's for this type of thing though, because spiders only know about href and will try to load that url and get a 404.
[14:25:16] <vernonk> mg983 sorry wasn't able to track it down.  I've got to head out.  Good luck!
[14:25:24] <mg983> Np thanks anyway
[14:25:42] <ilteris_> ah I see, smart. thanks for the heads up.
[14:30:35] <ilteris_> it's me again, is anyone kind enough to help me out with fitting the text and displaying a scrollbar when it is necessary here http://jsfiddle.net/3G8tH/74/?
[14:31:04] <ilteris_> I tried overflow:auto on the .research1 but it didn't work for me.
[14:32:00] <_wired> hey guys, im trying to do a background position change upon hover on an area in an image map.. the event fires, but somehow, the background position doesnt change. any thoughts? http://fb.zension.net/optest/test.html
[14:32:54] <rrva> If I load jquery from a CDN, and it is defined fine in all browsers except Ipad 6 Safari, what could be wrong? I load it like so: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[14:33:14] <ansikt> ilteris: What do you mean?  Should it never expand beyond the size of the viewing port?
[14:33:28] <rrva> Only Ipad 6 gets these errors: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: jQuery
[14:34:19] <ilteris_> ansikt: it should never expand the box it's sitting on
[14:34:42] <ilteris_> ansikt: instead  I would like to have a scrollbar
[14:35:26] <ilteris_> ansikt: it looks like i have to set the height explicitly
[14:35:35] <spuz_> is it possible to call either $() or find on a regular DOM element?
[14:36:12] <Andrew_R> spuz_: yes, $(regularDomElement).find(selector)
[14:36:52] <ansikt> ilteris_: overflow-y: scroll; works for me.
[14:37:05] <spuz_> AndreasEr, thanks
[14:38:24] <dotDeeka> mg983: You still hanging around?
[14:38:55] <ilteris_> ansikt: weird, that doesn't work for me
[14:41:02] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hi, I'm trying to make this function synchronous Nicolas_Leonidas
[14:41:15] <Nicolas_Leonidas> http://jsfiddle.net/MmGSx/ but it's still asynchronous
[14:41:28] <Nicolas_Leonidas> I want that function to return data, I don't want it to call a callback
[14:44:50] <Nicolas_Leonidas> can anyone help me make a jsonp, synchronous call?
[14:45:44] <systemfault> Nicolas_Leonidas: Due to the nature of JSONP, it's impossible
[14:46:05] <Nicolas_Leonidas> systemfault: really? why?
[14:46:31] <systemfault> Nicolas_Leonidas: Because of the way it works, it uses a <script> tag and use its "load" event
[14:46:40] <systemfault> jsonp is a hack, nothing more.
[14:47:43] <systemfault> jsonp isn't "ajax"
[14:57:30] <TheSisb> I have two .find results stored in variabes. var a = $('#a').find('li'); var b = $('#b').find('li');.  how do i combine both those results into 1 variable (array?
[14:58:10] <systemfault> var both = $('#a li, #b li');
[14:58:52] <TheSisb> I don't want to go through the dom again, I just want to merge results
[14:59:08] <gordian> TheSisb: use push()
[14:59:26] <TheSisb> gordian: how would you use push?
[14:59:56] <gordian> var myArray=new Array();
[15:00:11] <gordian> myArray.push(a); myArray.push(b);
[15:00:12] <systemfault> .add won't work?
[15:00:23] <systemfault> And nobody declares an array that way...
[15:00:28] <systemfault> var myArray = [];
[15:00:38] <systemfault> http://api.jquery.com/add/
[15:00:59] <systemfault> So both = a.add(b);
[15:02:36] <Blaster> hey guys, can anyone help me with this? http://jsfiddle.net/VfLY6/   -  I wnat to make it so no matter how many times you click "Set event handler", clicking "Fire Event Handler" only results in 1 popup.
[15:03:41] <Blaster> nvm I think I got it with http://jsfiddle.net/VfLY6/1/
[15:05:16] <gordian> Blaster: you could also do http://jsfiddle.net/VfLY6/2/
[15:05:32] <Blaster> ok
[15:05:35] <Blaster> thx
[15:06:47] <gordian> systemfault: you can't use add() on a string
[15:07:21] <systemfault> $(''#a').find('li') doesn't return a string.
[15:09:29] <gordian> word
[15:09:35] <gordian> but it still won't work
[15:09:47] <jokke> hey, what's the best way to debug syntax errors like unexpected token?
[15:10:45] <gordian> jokke: that's probably a missed closing quote or brace/paren
[15:11:41] <jokke> i found it
[15:11:45] <jokke> thanks
[15:13:24] <TheSisb> I forgot that .find() returns a jquery object and not an array of objects (duh @ internal .each()!)
[15:15:47] <TheSisb> finally settled on this.allCols		= $().add(this.lCols).add(this.cCols).add(this.rCols),
[15:15:51] <TheSisb> not sure about performance
[15:23:41] <Otineb> Howdy all
[15:26:00] <Otineb> I've got some code working in JSfiddle but when I move it to my production environment, it breaks. I can't figure out what is going on. I've confirmed that jquery is loaded (the only requisite I know of) and yet this error persists. I was wondering if one of you fine gents could take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/jMSxu/2/
[15:27:01] <b-lew> http://bvh.delineamultimedia.com/?page_id=2 -> is there a reason why the galleries in the drop downs don't work when you use the quicksand filters? I think its because the "li's" go away but am unsure how to fix it.
[15:27:48] <TheSisb> Otineb how does it break
[15:28:03] <TheSisb> are you sure the order of your scripts is okay?  jquery first, then your code, etc
[15:28:07] <Eviltwin> Bezier curves, ladies and gentlemen: http://jsfiddle.net/MfygT/show/
[15:28:12] <shoky> Otineb: you shouldn't really put a <span> as child of <ul>   or put a <li> as child of <span>
[15:28:37] <Otineb> @TheSisb: in my production enviro the html is not pushed into the targeted <span>
[15:28:40] <b-lew> any help would be great!
[15:28:49] <b-lew> I'm lost
[15:29:02] <Otineb> @TheSisb : I totally thought that might be my issue, but jquery is loaded first
[15:29:38] <TheSisb> Eviltwin that's really cool
[15:29:41] <shoky> Otineb: also "it breaks" isn't too informative
[15:30:12] <shoky> Otineb: sry didnt see you put a url
[15:30:17] <shoky> in the fiddle
[15:30:18] <Otineb> @shoky : I hear ya. I was cycling through any container for an id to see if that had anything to do with it. Seems absurd but span is where I ended up
[15:30:24] <TheSisb> Otineb wrap your code in (function(){  // code here })();
[15:31:10] <Otineb> @TheSisb : it's currently wrapped in $(document).ready(function() { - would that work?
[15:37:17] <shoky> Otineb: the document.ready callback isn't being executed for some reason
[15:38:18] <Otineb> @shoky: Whoa. I'll google about it. How did you figure that out?
[15:38:36] <shoky> Otineb: i put a breakpoint in it
[15:38:48] <Otineb> @shoky : ^protip
[15:39:37] <shoky> Otineb: try putting the <script> in the <head> section,  or put it at the end of <body> without the doc.ready
[15:39:55] <gordian> shoky: this is killing me
[15:39:56] <Otineb> @shoky : ok
[15:40:03] <gordian> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/AzSWV/2/
[15:40:09] <shoky> oh
[15:40:09] <gordian> i know you're a man who enjoys a good challenge
[15:40:15] <shoky> Otineb: ok got it..
[15:40:37] <shoky> Otineb: that swppFormValidation.js is causing an error
[15:40:40] <gordian> if you uncomment the CSS then the page scrolls horizontally which is what i want
[15:40:47] <gordian> problem is that it breaks the scrollspy
[15:41:08] <gordian> so when you scroll to a new section that section's navbar anchor should get the 'active' class added and removed as needed
[15:41:18] <gordian> (scrollspy is working vertically)
[15:41:52] <Otineb> @shoky: I was afraid you were going to say that. What's the issue? Is it that each script is calling document.ready?
[15:41:53] <b-ot> Otineb: I am not in that..
[15:41:59] <shoky> Otineb:  it's $('#title').rules(..) causing the error,  you have no #title element
[15:43:11] <Otineb> @shoky : not on this page anyway. It's for a deeper page. Would that also be true of the rest of them? #function1, #phoneMain, etc?
[15:46:05] <shoky> Otineb: i dunno, you can easily check that
[15:46:21] <shoky> the console is your friend
[15:46:27] <Otineb> shoky: ok. i'll kill that part of the script and see what happens

[16:12:48] <maxwell_> damn im missing the pearljam concert
[16:13:09] <sunbeam> any idea guys
[16:13:27] <ansikt> sunbeam:  Why do you want to?

[16:19:46] <sunbeam> Is there a good js library for checking a form?
[16:20:42] <mg983> shoky: that doesn't fully fix it
[16:23:09] <tw2113> sunbeam, what server side language are you using to process the form
[16:26:11] <shoky> mg983: seems fine to me

[16:26:31] <shoky> ya
[16:29:39] <JFranks> Hmmm... If I used jQuery('input').attr('disabled','disabled'); to make all inputs unavailable on a page.. how do you reverse it? jQuery('input').attr('disabled','false');  .. jQuery('input').attr('disabled',''); ... those won't work.. you need to delete the attribute?
[16:29:40] <shoky> gordian: wtf sorry, forgot to look at your issue
[16:31:24] <JFranks> Ooops.. someone else was helping me out and put "disabled='disabled'" manually on the inputs.. Strike my last.. that might not be as stated..
[16:31:38] <JFranks> I know I can't fix the inputs with that command at least.. :)
[16:32:44] <shoky> JFranks:  best to use .prop('disabled', true/false)
[16:35:05] <gordian> shoky: no worries
[16:35:10] <gordian> let me know if i can answer anything
[16:38:11] <shoky> gordian: are you just expecting it to magically work with horizontal scrolling because it worked with vertical scrolling?
[16:38:58] <shoky> or is there a reason you think it should be working?
[16:39:33] <shoky> s/reason/reason why/
[16:42:36] <shoky> gordian: also.. you're expecting it to magically work on an inner <div> even tho you're using it on 'body'
[16:45:19] <echoee> hi guys, is there any good tool to debug DOM events?
[16:45:35] <echoee> i need to know all the events attached onto a DOM object
[16:45:51] <echoee> and cant really find out from firebug (that or i dont know how to)
[16:47:23] <shoky> gordian:  run it on the right element, change every "top" to "left" and every "height" to "width" http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/AzSWV/8/
[16:50:56] <shoky> echoee: donno about firebug, it's easy with chrome.. "Event Listeners" on the right in elements tab
[16:56:44] <gordian> shoky: i tried both of those but i guess i never tried them both together
[16:56:48] <gordian> THANK YOU

[17:47:50] <sheilablackrose> hi guys i have a couple of nested div...<div class='1'><div class='2'>.........class 5 </div> ,....    would i be able to get a specific div by doing $('.5').previous('div').find('1')
[17:51:01] <JFranks> AAAAGH! Just when I thought I was done.. I managed to make a page loop.. I took the submit button off a form, and made a 'submit' image with an onClick function that does an ajax call with the form data, and then it does a $('#contactForm').trigger('submit'); which SOMEHOW re-triggers the function bound to the mouse click on the image?!?!1
[17:51:54] <JFranks> I wonder if I put the submit button back but put it UNDER the image... Then it won
[17:52:01] <JFranks> 't "click" the image??
[17:52:23] <JFranks> How jQuery is activating that image is beyond me though..
[17:53:40] <JFranks> Aha! Found it.. derp. :)
[17:57:16] <shoky> sheilablackrose: no
[17:58:11] <sheilablackrose> ahh shoky
[17:58:16] <sheilablackrose> how are you
[17:58:18] <sheilablackrose> been awhile
[17:59:09] <coldhead> a while*
[17:59:18] <shoky> am alrighty, how are youse
[17:59:47] <sheilablackrose> im ok had long holiday
[18:00:00] <sheilablackrose> yes grammar nazi coldhead :)
[18:00:07] <sheilablackrose> a while
[18:00:41] <shoky> long holiday here too
[18:01:03] <sheilablackrose> i have a dynamic nested divs n span. problem is i would not know how many they are. is there a way i can do a prev n get the div with a class .test1
[18:01:07] <sheilablackrose> easter holiday is big over there?
[18:01:09] <sheilablackrose> cool
[18:01:22] <shoky> heh almost. passover
[18:01:23] <sheilablackrose> had a chocolate pizza. didn't know it existed
[18:01:29] <sheilablackrose> ah ic
[18:01:36] <mike_f> I'm going to ask what is obviously a dumb question: Is there a difference between "var foo = new Object( { ... } );" and "var foo = { ... };"?
[18:02:14] <shoky> sheilablackrose: if they're nested then .prev() won't help you because that looks for siblings, not parents
[18:02:26] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:02:30] <shoky> sheilablackrose: you probably want .closest('.test1')
[18:03:02] <sheilablackrose> shoky problem is it coubd be another set of divs so there will be a test1 again
[18:03:15] <sheilablackrose> so it has to b prev
[18:03:36] <mike_f> It appears to my eyes that putting new Object( ... ) around the json doesn't change what I see in the debugger window of Chrome, but I don't know...
[18:03:44] <shoky> sheilablackrose: make a jsfiddle, as usual, if you want to be clearly understood
[18:03:54] <sheilablackrose> ok will try to rpelicate it
[18:03:57] <sheilablackrose> give me a sec
[18:03:59] <shoky> .prev() looks for the immediately previous sibling
[18:05:18] <shoky> mike_f that's not json. and those 2 do the same thing, there's no reason to do new Object(..)
[18:05:23] <sheilablackrose> ic
[18:07:58] <sheilablackrose> shoky closest works
[18:08:00] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[18:08:19] <sheilablackrose> the rest of the div are hidden so i added the is visible
[18:08:44] <shoky> that says nothing to anyone but you, without a fiddle..
[18:09:04] <shoky> why does this escape everyone
[18:09:11] <relipse> ok everyone check out my new jquery plugin: http://paste.ee/r/zbqGK <-- does this do the job ok
[18:09:53] <shoky> relipse if you want us to test your plugin, why not give us a fiddle ..

[18:49:17] <coldhead> looking good, relipse
[18:49:18] <relipse> hallelujah :)
[18:49:34] <relipse> how do i add it to jquery's plugins?
[18:49:42] <coldhead> put it on github
[18:49:48] <coldhead> then import from there
[18:50:10] <Quest> thanks case solved
[19:00:47] <relipse> coldhead: ok i got it on github, now what: https://github.com/relipse/jquery-hopinputs
[19:08:42] <larzen> Folks, is it possible to create a jQuery object on an element from a string? say I have an input, and I type in 'button' -> i would like for this to build a button JQUI object.
[19:13:36] <relipse>  plugins are colliding because many of them use onkeydown onkeypress and onkeyup,
[19:15:39] <larzen> is this possible: jQuery('.someElement').'button()' <-- this is what I am trying to accomplish. Pass the name of the object as a string.
[19:15:49] <relipse> is there a way to unfocus() my element?
[19:16:37] <ansikt> relipse: .blur()
[19:16:53] <shoky> larzen:  jQuery('.someElement')['button']()
[19:17:03] <larzen> shoky - win!! perfect.
[19:21:55] <relipse> does anyone know another version of next(':input') in order to get the next input (no matter what even if it is not sibling)
[19:22:03] <relipse> like find().after() ?
[19:23:07] <larzen> shoky:  addItem: function(itemType, options) {		var el = jQuery('<li>')[itemType](options); <-- "is not a function"
[19:25:47] <shoky> larzen: and what's itemType? and, make a jsfiddle
[19:26:19] <larzen> shoky, its just an arbitrary string
[19:26:21] <larzen> i havent passed it yet.
[19:26:28] <larzen> this gets an error on compile
[19:26:33] <larzen> on run i mean.
[19:26:47] <shoky> huh
[19:26:57] <larzen> i am going to make an example
[19:27:04] <shoky> yerp
[19:28:05] <relipse> how can i get the next tabindexed input ?
[19:28:47] <relipse> $(ipt_foo).find_next_tab_index_input()
[19:31:50] <larzen> shoky http://jsfiddle.net/a9ke4/7/
[19:32:25] <larzen> shoky -- yeah it works: http://jsfiddle.net/a9ke4/8/
[19:32:30] <larzen> crap.. i wonder what I am doing wrong.
[19:37:54] <sheilablackrose> is there a jquery code to check if a content has overflowed
[19:38:49] <tbmiller> what's up guys
[19:39:44] <coldhead> space gypsies
[19:39:50] <tbmiller> have any of you experienced an issue with hastag 'jumping' when users click on a tab (hyperlink)?
[19:40:06] <tbmiller> I'm trying to disable this sideeffect but I'm running into issues
[19:40:24] <coldhead> relipse: http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[19:41:27] <relipse> ok thanks too much work right now
[19:47:47] <sheilablackrose> coldhead how do i check if a content has overflow?
[19:51:34] <danheberden> sheilablackrose: i'm no coldhead, but i'd check scrollHeight/scrollWidth
[19:51:49] <danheberden> against the elements actual height/width
[19:53:08] <sheilablackrose> i tried that but im getting undefined
[19:53:30] <sheilablackrose> i get the value $mainContentDiv.height()
[19:53:39] <sheilablackrose> but as for the scrool its showing undefined
[19:56:10] <danheberden> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/E2pGm/
[19:58:02] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[19:58:49] <sheilablackrose> danheberden i'm getting the value for prop scroll height
[19:58:57] <sheilablackrose> but th ething is its the same value as .height
[19:59:12] <danheberden> hmm, maybe a browser difference
[19:59:17] <sheilablackrose> even when i can see the content overflowing
[19:59:24] <danheberden> maybe try outerHeight() ?
[19:59:40] <sheilablackrose> ok
[19:59:45] <sheilablackrose> let me try that
[20:00:39] <sheilablackrose> same thing
[20:00:42] <sheilablackrose> same value as height
[20:02:52] <StressedEddie> Anyone know how to get info tips to pop up alongside focused text areas?
[20:04:37] <Gmac_> is it better to use classes or data attributes with jqury
[20:06:48] <dcherman> Gmac_: neither.  depends on what you're trying to accomplish.
[20:08:24] <chee> is it better to use cheese or ham for sandwiches
[20:10:29] <tw2113> both
[20:11:32] <Gmac_> so… is it better to use classes or data attributes
[20:12:11] <chee> Gmac_: for what
[20:12:44] <Gmac_> when i want to make a click event for multiple elements on the page, i have been giving these elements a common class
[20:12:53] <Gmac_> lets say the class was jclick
[20:13:01] <Gmac_> so i have 5 elements who get jclick
[20:13:16] <Gmac_> and click looks for the closest jtoggle
[20:13:23] <Gmac_> and that class toggles
[20:13:28] <Gmac_> but it must be the closest.
[20:13:48] <tw2113> classes are just fine for selectors
[20:14:02] <tw2113> data attributes are more meant to store extra data that you don't need visitors to actually see
[20:14:34] <Gmac_> but today i realized. if i use data attributes i could have data-click = 1, and data-toggle = 1. and that will be a pair. and data-click = 2....
[20:14:46] <Gmac_> and then i can have pairs of elements that click and toggle
[20:15:05] <Gmac_> what do you think
[20:20:32] <defaultro> good evening folks, what do I need so I can start my jquery mobile learning?
[20:20:44] <defaultro> my phones here are android and windows 8 phone
[20:25:50] <chee> Gmac_: it all sounds very horrible. perhaps you could give them different class names. but i think looking for the closest sounds fine to me. unless you need them not to be closest. all i'm sayin' is, using the class as the selector is about twice as fast as using a data attribute as a selector. according to this jolly jsperf http://jsperf.com/classes-vs-data-attributes
[20:26:18] <Gmac_> alrighty thanks!
[20:27:30] <Gmac_> and whats the best way to give the elelemt an event that works well on computer and mobile? I've been using on('touch start click') but you have to deal with  ghost clicks (where the iAd registers 2 clicks)
[20:27:56] <Gmac_> thats: on('touchstart click')
[20:28:21] <Gmac_> iPad registers 2 clicks…. sheesh my mac thinks its so smart...
[20:28:25] <Gmac_> correcting my writing
[20:32:10] <rakl> is there anyway to make $.ajax accept an array of objects?
[20:34:24] <coldhead> use a crow bar?
[20:35:37] <shoky> sacrifice your eldest
[20:37:24] <chee> rakl: accept how, witch?
[20:37:52] <chee> what do you want it to do with them, once it has accepted them?
[20:37:52] <rakl> never mind, I just wrapped it in an object
[20:38:19] <chee> coldhead: listened to you
[20:41:59] <coldhead> great work everyone
[20:42:01] <coldhead> let's all take 5
[20:42:22] <defaulto|away> Hey guys, how do I install a jquery mobile app on android or windows phone?
[20:43:58] <coldhead> defaulto|away: you put a jquery mobile app on the web
[20:44:08] <coldhead> and access that URL from a mobile browser
[20:44:20] <defaulto|away> ah
[20:44:33] <defaulto|away> what about as an app that we touch on our phone?
[20:45:12] <defaulto|away> I'm reading this now, I hope it's a good tutorial - http://www.noupe.com/tutorial/jquery-mobile-tutorial-creating-a-restaurant-picker-web-app.html
[20:46:02] <coldhead> you can save the bookmark on the home screen
[20:46:17] <coldhead> otherwise to turn it into an app you probably want phonegap or something
[20:50:50] <defaulto|away> got it
[20:50:54] <Gmac_> i need help. i have a touch start event that toggles a div. the problem is, if you try to scroll and your finger goes over the div it will toggle
[20:50:58] <defaulto|away> looks like jquery mobile is easy :D
[20:51:03] <defaulto|away> that tutorial I found is great
[20:51:15] <Gmac_> how can i stop the even if its a drag NOT a tocuh
[20:53:53] <defaulto|away> what type of code is that called? It's not bar code
[20:53:57] <coldhead> this is a hard problem, Gmac_
[20:54:16] <Gmac_> well how do ppl overcome it?
[20:54:19] <coldhead> if you google for it you'll find a lot of different not very satisfactory solutions
[20:54:29] <Gmac_> i did :)
[20:54:34] <coldhead> i overcome it by saying it can't be done and telling my client to want something easier
[20:54:34] <Gmac_> they are not satisfactory
[20:54:44] <Gmac_> what happens if i change it from touch start to touchend
[20:54:53] <Gmac_> or can I see if its touch move and do nothing?
[20:54:54] <defaulto|away> ah, looks like a jquery mobile app is simple a web application that uses jquery mobile library as compared to a compiled app
[20:54:57] <Gmac_> and how would i dot hat
[20:55:25] <defaulto|away> am I right that a jquery mobile app can't be a stand alone app?
[20:55:41] <Gmac_> WHAT! so what do you do when you want something to toggle!!!?
[20:57:04] <coldhead> why can't it, defaulto|away
[20:57:11] <coldhead> the jquery ui mobile docs are a stand alone app
[20:57:12] <defaulto|away> no, I was asking.
[20:57:17] <coldhead> and they're done in jq mobile
[20:57:25] <coldhead> and stand alone
[20:57:38] <defaulto|away> how can it access the jquery mobile library?
[20:57:40] <coldhead> like a man whose wife has left him for his best friend
[20:58:06] <coldhead> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/docs/about/getting-started.html
[20:58:19] <defaulto|away> k
[21:11:57] <b1lly> coldhead:
[21:11:59] <b1lly> got a question for you
[21:12:45] <b1lly> what's faster.... $('#id').find('.class'),    $('#id .class'),  $('.class', '#id')
[21:15:05] <coldhead> probably the first, i don't think the 3rd works like that
[21:15:15] <coldhead> the 2nd param should be a node, not a selector
[21:15:27] <coldhead> $('.class', $('#id'))
[21:15:41] <coldhead> you should put it on jsperf and try it and see
[21:15:53] <b1lly> coldhead: +1 brownie pts
[21:16:23] <b1lly> do you know why .find is the fastest?
[21:17:09] <coldhead> because selecting just a single ID is fast
[21:17:19] <coldhead> it uses getElementById internally
[21:17:24] <coldhead> and then find is optimised from tehre
[21:17:37] <coldhead> a more complicated selector gives jquery more work to do to work out WHAT to do
[21:17:41] <coldhead> before it can even do it
[21:18:30] <b1lly> coldhead: +2 brownie pts
[21:22:01] <coldhead> -1 brownie pts for you b1lly for trusting me instead of running actual code to prove it :)
[21:22:47] <coldhead> http://jsperf.com/find-vs-descendant-selector/33
[21:23:14] <aidan> I'm calling .unbind('click') on something, but it's not unbinding anything
[21:23:18] <b1lly> coldhead: I already knew the answer
[21:23:38] <b1lly> coldhead: I've read the jquery source and have done research on jquery performance :O
[21:24:09] <coldhead> so whydja ask!
[21:24:12] <coldhead> you testing me?
[21:24:19] <coldhead> +10 brownie pts for testing me
[21:24:40] <b1lly> well, yes, but I also thought it would be good for other people in #jquery to learn
[21:24:45] <coldhead> aidan: i think your unbind has to exactly match your bind() params
[21:24:49] <coldhead> at least that's how it used to be
[21:25:03] <aidan> coldhead: I wnt to unbind everything
[21:25:03] <coldhead> i use .bind('click.aids') and then unbind('click.aids') for safety
[21:25:08] <coldhead> oh
[21:25:11] <coldhead> brutal
[21:25:23] <coldhead> i learned, b1lly
[21:25:30] <coldhead> I LEARNED NEVER TO TRUST YOUR HEART TO A WOMAN
[21:25:34] <coldhead> sorry wrong window
[21:26:01] <jedimind> quick question, is there a way to bind a setInterval to an object? and will it get killed (the interval) if you .empty() the container of object?
[21:28:05] <Gmac_> i got my mobile click working!
[21:28:08] <Gmac_> perfectly
[21:28:17] <Gmac_> it involved a few if statements but its nice
[21:29:10] <coldhead> way to go, Gmac_ !
[21:29:27] <coldhead> why don't you treat yourself to some kind of dessert or cigarette or whiskey or something
[21:38:24] <Gmac_> perhaps
[21:38:41] <coldhead> you earned it, babe
[21:38:48] <coldhead> you solved a hard problem
[21:38:54] <coldhead> INNER CHILD NEEDS REWARDING
[21:44:22] <shoky> shoky
[21:44:29] <shoky> whoops
[21:45:09] <coldhead> googling yourself there shoky?
[21:46:48] <shoky> searchin jdate
[21:46:58] <shoky> for the only one who can please me
[21:47:20] <coldhead> the leading jewish singles network?
[21:47:24] <coldhead> i want in on that action
[21:48:30] <shoky> meh
[21:48:58] <coldhead> racist
[21:49:33] <shoky> that i am
[21:50:06] <shoky> just came in 2nd the other day
[21:51:22] <macbleser> hey all - i'm trying to come up with a solution for a little problem i have involving a vertical timeline using jquery masonry. hoping someone here smarter than me can help me figure it out
[21:52:13] <coldhead> at this point to help you they would need to be both a genius AND A MIND READER :P
[21:52:23] <coldhead> we do have those though so please hang in there
[21:52:28] <shoky> just look for the middle path
[21:53:01] <shoky> and wave at coldhead from above
[21:54:34] <macbleser> haha well i've come prepared. here is an example full screen preview http://fiddle.jshell.net/Eu3jJ/7/show/light/ and here is the editable fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Eu3jJ/7/
[21:57:01] <macbleser> what i'm trying to do is come up with a way that to adjust the position triangle tooltips/red dots on items where they either directly overlap or are too close to each other
[21:59:20] <macbleser> as you can see, the timeline-items generally are positioned the order that they appear in the flow of the markup
[22:02:05] <macbleser> but visually i don't want any of the timeline-items to look like they occurred at the same time on the bar or occurred too close to each other
[22:04:14] <macbleser> for example, the first two timeline-item divs have the same top position so their tooltips are directly on top of each other
[22:09:37] <macbleser> can anyone think of a way to check detect if those tooltips are within say 20px or less of another one and if true add some margin top to the one that appears later in the flow?
[22:18:35] <Cork> macbleser: only way to detect "neighbors" is to grab a list of the elements, grab there offsets, height and width and calculate where they are
[22:19:31] <shoky> macbleser: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Eu3jJ/8/
[22:20:46] <macbleser> shoky that is amazing!
[22:20:59] <shoky> would've been less "magic" numbers if you were working with box-sizing: border-box
[22:22:57] <maxwell_> im wondering why $container.load(path+" "+".logAddressContainer"); duplicates the class after it loads ?
[22:23:14] <eddieg> Anyone know how to do Twitter-like character counters for multiple text areas in Rails?
[22:24:00] <coldhead> duplicates the class?
[22:24:03] <shoky> maxwell_: you mean duplicates a nested element with that class?
[22:24:06] <macbleser> shoky - I was actually using border-box at first but unsure if I would need to support ie7 or not
[22:24:15] <maxwell_> shoky:  yes
[22:24:48] <shoky> macbleser: yea there's ie7 :\ welp you could switch those numbers with fetching the border from js, kinda annoying.
[22:25:41] <shoky> maxwell_: and you can't guess what the problem is?
[22:25:53] <maxwell_> shoky:  really not
[22:26:04] <shoky> maxwell_: .load() loads INTO an element
[22:26:04] <maxwell_> im just seeing a duplicate element
[22:26:51] <macbleser> shoky: yeah good call. well thanks a ton for providing me with that solution!
[22:27:00] <maxwell_> yeah but im trying to find out why it ends up duplicating .logAddressContainer
[22:27:04] <shoky> np macbleser
[22:27:17] <shoky> maxwell_  does $container have that class?
[22:27:20] <macbleser> Cork: thanks for your input as well
[22:27:35] <maxwell_> shoky:  http://jsfiddle.net/9fmVL/
[22:27:49] <shoky> yes.
[22:28:07] <shoky> maxwell_: .load() loads INTO an element
[22:28:13] <shoky> it doesn't load THE element
[22:28:25] <shoky> or, it doesn't replace the element
[22:29:01] <maxwell_> weird
[22:29:16] <maxwell_> yeah thats what i read in the tutorial
[22:29:21] <nesoi> hello… so I'm trying to use simpledialog2, and I'm finding that if I create a popup dialog via a touch event, the dialog also gets the touch event, even though the dialog isn't present until after the event. Is there a way to grab the touch event in such a way that nothing else ever sees it?
[22:30:15] <nesoi> or some other way to stop this from happening?
[22:31:38] <nesoi> in other words, user clicks on a listview. I'm watching the touch event on the listview, and under some circumstances I invoke simpledialog2 to display a popup.
[22:32:15] <nesoi> the new dialog also gets a click if it overlies the listview in the place the user clicked
[22:32:26] <nesoi> how can that be stopped?
[22:33:19] <nesoi> assuming someone's here who knows, of course… :)
[22:34:31] <nesoi> or that anyone is here for that matter...
[22:35:38] <sheilablackrose> ok ghuys see ya
[22:35:42] <sheilablackrose> thanks n good night
[22:35:49] <coldhead> bye forever, sheilablackrose
[22:35:56] <sheilablackrose> you'll miss me
[22:36:34] <shoky> o/~
[22:36:39] <coldhead> it won't be the same without you
[22:37:27] <sheilablackrose> haha
[22:37:39] <sheilablackrose> good night shoky! coldhead!
[22:37:54] <sheilablackrose> actually its just 4.30
[22:37:59] <sheilablackrose> i thought it was 5
[22:37:59] <sheilablackrose> damn
[22:59:17] <maxwell_> gosh
[23:03:43] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take 5
[23:17:38] <larzen> hmm... how do i detect if a page scroll has happened?
[23:22:38] <Cork> larzen: you can't detect if it HAS happend
[23:22:44] <Cork> you can detect if it happens though
[23:23:01] <Cork> $(window).on('scroll', function(event) {});
[23:27:40] <coldhead> beautiful semantics
[23:36:24] <thomedy> hey i have been doing raw js... and i know that we are on 1.9 and almost 2 or something when i left jquery it was document.ready andi have done (function($){})(jQuery) ubut im trying to form an example on jsfiddle for someone and cant seemt o figure out how to get my function to run because of that i think
[23:41:50] <coldhead> that should still work, thomedy
[23:41:56] <coldhead> but in the fiddle you can remove that wrapper
[23:42:04] <coldhead> and just select ready or load from the menu at left
[23:44:13] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/HNVzW/2/
[23:44:19] <thomedy> why am i retarded this is simple stuff
[23:45:33] <thomedy> nm...
[23:50:08] <Cork> thomedy: you got it working?
[23:50:25] <thomedy> yeah its just been a while since i have done jquery i didn't have the {} on animate
[23:50:31] <thomedy> it was a n error not a load situation
[23:50:39] <thomedy> thank you though
