[00:22:33] <motaka2> is tehere a way to figure out when an attribute value is changing ?
[00:48:32] <guzzlefry> motaka2: For what purpose?
[00:51:37] <guzzlefry> motaka2: http://caniuse.com/#search=mutation There's that. Support is decent.
[00:51:53] <motaka2> i want when data-defTags change I can show something below an edit box
[00:52:07] <guzzlefry> oh
[00:53:05] <guzzlefry> If you do something like $('#whatever').data('item', 'value'), then the attribute itself doesn't change at all.
[00:53:44] <motaka2> guzzlefry: I use attr
[00:54:30] <guzzlefry> You probably shouldn't.
[01:04:47] <motaka2> how can I make setDefault defined in line 75 available in line 175 in this code?
[01:04:58] <motaka2> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/747dd27b794f6e2d36b7
[04:05:24] <jop007> I have a routine that changes an input.val and also an onchange event on that field when I change the value the onchange is getting fired also how to diferentiatethis two type of events?
[04:06:01] <arthurvr> jop007: jsfiddle?
[04:06:16] <xx6> hey I hav a question
[04:06:26] <arthurvr> !ask @ xx6
[04:06:26] <b-ot> xx6: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:06:44] <xx6> okay thanks jop007
[04:07:28] <jop007> for?
[04:07:39] <xx6> meant arthurvr
[04:07:41] <xx6> sorry
[04:08:22] <xx6> arthurvr: css autoprefixes my properties right?
[04:08:39] <arthurvr> css doesn’t, but .css() does, awesome isn’t it?
[04:09:23] <xx6> okay thank you
[04:09:34] <jop007> I do it server site with this string number_format ( float $number , int $decimals = 0 , string $dec_point = "." , string $thousands_sep = "," )
[04:09:52] <arthurvr> xx6: Also, api.jquery.com/css ftw
[04:10:17] <xx6> jop007:does what?
[04:10:37] <xx6> Thanks arthurvr but couldn't find that over there.
[04:10:58] <arthurvr> You couldn’t find it on the api page?
[04:10:59] <arthurvr> ”As of jQuery 1.8, the .css() setter will automatically take care of prefixing the property name. For example, take .css( "user-select", "none" ) in Chrome/Safari will set it as -webkit-user-select, Firefox will use -moz-user-select, and IE10 will use -ms-user-select.”
[04:11:31] <arthurvr> xx6: That’s quite clear isn’t it?
[04:12:32] <xx6> kk
[04:12:49] <xx6> thx jop007 and arthurvr
[04:13:15] <arthurvr> you’re welcome
[04:35:21] <devPunk> Hello, I'm relatively new to JQuery and I have a question: I'm having issues manipulating an element that I already moved in the hierarchy. The manipulating statements don't seem to "catch" the moved element. Is there a hint?
[04:48:58] <devPunk> hm - anyone?
[06:05:02] <chillsurf> hi there. I haave this code and I am having problem with java_anim_add variable at the second function. It is always zero, although at the first one is either 90 or 150
[06:05:27] <chillsurf> if i add at line 40 $java_anima_add it doesnt work
[06:05:40] <chillsurf> i dont know a thing about php and jquery
[06:05:47] <chillsurf> its the first time i do something like this
[06:05:53] <chillsurf> so any help would be appreciated

[07:45:11] <MrSnoopal> hey guys. im loading new dom via ajax. this is added by using $().append(response); it contains a link which should also being used to load the next elements. but for some reason the events are not bind to the new dom. eventhough i used $(..).on('click',function() {} any idea?
[07:47:10] <MrSnoopal> and everything is wrapped to jQuery(document).on('ready',function() {}
[07:49:45] <AssassinsMod> `jQuery(document).on('ready',function() {}` -> $(document).ready(function() {}` ?
[07:50:20] <AssassinsMod> for the rest i don't know if `$().` is valid..
[07:50:55] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: About the document ready, that’s perfectly valid.
[07:51:01] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/ganixicone/1/edit
[07:51:22] <AssassinsMod> arthurvr: yeah, it was just to make it shorter
[07:51:26] <arthurvr> fn.ready is a shorthand event, just like click() is a shorthand for .on(‘click’, fn)
[07:51:49] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: It’s just a personal opinion but try to avoid shorthands.
[07:53:54] <AssassinsMod> arthurvr: is there a reason? (anyway MrSnoopal still has the problem i presume)
[07:53:59] <MrSnoopal> as far as i know is $(document).on('click', also possible to bind to new dom
[07:54:18] <MrSnoopal> if you use $(document).ready() it wont trigger on new dom
[07:56:13] <arthurvr> MrSnoopal: Things like .click() and .on(‘click’, fn) are exactly the same. Let me search the source code for you.
[07:57:08] <arthurvr> MrSnoopal: here you go sir https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event/alias.js#L6
[07:57:16] <arthurvr> Exactly the same, huh
[07:57:37] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: Performance but mainly clarity
[07:59:00] <arthurvr> AssassinsMod: Anyways it’s a personal opinion bro.
[07:59:17] <arthurvr> And yes, MrSnoopal at the end has still his problem :) let’s stop bikeshedding
[07:59:22] <MrSnoopal> kk but why doesnt it trigger on the new dom ? :/
[07:59:49] <arthurvr> MrSnoopal: That has actually nothing to do with it.
[08:00:07] <arthurvr> MrSnoopal: Would you be able to show us a fiddle?
[08:00:09] <arthurvr> !paste
[08:00:09] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:02:30] <MrSnoopal> http://pastebin.com/hY1r6W3f
[08:02:56] <MrSnoopal> it works fine the first time. new dom also contains a .work-case-study-2015-load-next-link
[08:03:25] <arthurvr> That’s a paste, not a working testcase. Anyways, let me take a look.
[08:03:49] <arthurvr> MrSnoopal: Is it throwing anything in the console?
[08:04:04] <MrSnoopal> nope. not when i click on it the second time. it does not fire anything
[08:04:18] <MrSnoopal> http://sr.van.enjoyorbite.com/case-study/huge-paper/
[08:04:29] <MrSnoopal> if you scroll down you see the link "load next case study"
[08:04:32] <MrSnoopal> first time it works
[08:04:40] <MrSnoopal> second time even preventdefault doesnt trigger
[08:05:05] <arthurvr> gotta leave but somebody else will be able to explain I guess
[08:05:39] <arthurvr> oh it’s the handler which is wrong I think
[08:05:43] <arthurvr> anyways gotta run
[08:08:45] <MrSnoopal> thanks for your help
[08:08:58] <MrSnoopal> if someone could me help that would be great :)
[08:10:40] <Rangedboyke> hi, does anyone know how I can make a side menu in JQuery mobile when I display it "block" with css media queries?
[08:10:52] <Rangedboyke> I don't understand how to get a panel right to a page.
[08:12:51] <Rangedboyke> http://pastebin.com/4YpZzTSP
[08:21:38] <MrSnoopal> grml i really do not understand why this does not trigger. it has the same name, it hase the correct selector but it does not trigger. i run mad :D
[08:24:10] <AssassinsMod> arthurvr: sorry, i've been a bit busy with bash.. anyway i'll keep that in mind
[08:27:09] <MrSnoopal> ok I got it
[08:27:17] <MrSnoopal> had to delegate the event from body to the class
[08:27:20] <MrSnoopal> this made it work now
[08:31:47] <decx> you want to delegate as close to the new element as possible
[09:28:09] <Rangedboyke> anyone who has a tutorial which explains how to get a menu on the left/right side of your application? I've got already the application made but need only a menu (when someone uses a tablet) on the right side. Can't get it working. Styles doesn't work anymore if I put a panel on the right side.
[10:35:49] <MrSnoopal> Rangedboyke you propabily should learn css in more detail ;)
[10:36:01] <MrSnoopal> and how to structure html as well
[10:39:18] <Rangedboyke> It's just an example MrSnoopal :p
[10:39:20] <Rangedboyke> I know that..
[10:49:14] <dannylop> Hello, I have a php output, which is in a variable $classes, I am trying to store it in a js variable var classes = "<?php echo $classes; ?>"; but when I do this, I get an error "SyntaxError: missing ; before statement"
[10:49:45] <dannylop> here's the output of the php variable > http://pastebin.com/ePk9v5qr
[10:53:12] <rcyr> We don't care what your PHP is. Show us the generated JS.
[10:53:23] <arthurvr> dannylop: The problem are the quotes.
[10:53:54] <arthurvr> rcyr: We only needed this to catch it. It’s not php, if you would have looked at it.
[10:54:57] <rcyr> To me and anyone with half a brain, var classes = "<?php echo $classes; ?>"; is PHP
[10:55:02] <rcyr> KTHX.
[10:55:11] <dannylop> generated js ?
[10:55:17] <arthurvr> rcyr: yes, but that wasn’t important in here.
[10:55:35] <arthurvr> dannylop: The problem is that you will need to escape the quotes.
[10:55:36] <dannylop> arthurvr: which quotes? " <<
[10:55:56] <rcyr> dannylop: Your delimiters are double quotes..... and  your JSON also contains them.
[10:56:28] <rcyr> dannylop: Try changing: var classes = "<?php echo $classes; ?>"; with var classes = '<?php echo $classes; ?>';
[10:56:32] <dannylop> i tried var classes = '<?php echo $classes; ?>'; also
[10:56:58] <rcyr> Then try to escape the double quotes :(
[10:57:12] <dannylop> hm ok that gives me another error
[10:57:21] <arthurvr> dannylop: and honestly, just don’t use this kind of tricky techniques :/
[10:57:31] <arthurvr> build out a decent api lol
[10:58:04] <dannylop> i know am just learning things here
[10:58:19] <dannylop> is anyone familiar with fullcalendar
[10:58:39] <arthurvr> dannylop: I used it once, why?
[10:59:23] <dannylop> i am trying to pass that value to "events"
[11:00:05] <dannylop> http://pastebin.com/S8AE9Suq
[11:00:09] <dannylop> somethin like this
[11:00:48] <arthurvr> well yeah instead of tricky and even dangerous things like this you’d better use a decent api. Anyway, escape the double quotes and normally it will work fine.
[11:01:03] <dannylop> i did escape and that error is gone
[11:01:08] <arthurvr> Also, you’ll need an extra JSON.parse I guess?
[11:01:22] <arthurvr> The data you pass should be an object, not a string.
[11:01:51] <arthurvr> your string is now a json formatted object. You can turn it into an object using JSON.parse
[11:01:57] <arthurvr> google it lol :D
[11:02:10] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.parseJSON @ dannylop
[11:02:10] <b-ot> dannylop: jQuery.parseJSON: Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[11:02:16] <dannylop> ok
[11:02:20] <arthurvr> if you need old browsers with you use parseJSON ^
[11:03:36] <guzzlefry> Even IE8 supports the native JSON.parse
[11:03:50] <guzzlefry> http://caniuse.com/#search=json
[11:04:27] <dannylop> thanks dude
[11:04:47] <dannylop> doesn anyone use IE 7 now?
[11:04:58] <dannylop> XP users maybe
[11:05:08] <guzzlefry> I personally don't support anything less than IE10.
[11:05:08] <rcyr> dannylop: Most XP users use IE8 or IE6 (Companies)
[11:05:31] <arthurvr> dannylop: I’m planning not to develop for IE8 or lower anymore, but depends on your needs.
[11:05:31] <rcyr> dannylop: IE7 was never used much.
[11:06:18] <arthurvr> For development focussed tools, mostly the open source stuff I do, we don’t care about IE at all anymore
[11:06:40] <rcyr> dannylop: If you can, support IE9 and later.
[11:06:49] <dannylop> ok true XP had IE6, and Win7 had IE8
[11:07:09] <arthurvr> IE is generally <5% on development focussed sites lol
[11:07:51] <rcyr> Yeah sure... anyone tech savvy will not use IE unless it's some stupid company policy
[11:08:15] <arthurvr> I only use IE to run my test suites anyways :D
[11:09:00] <rcyr> For a lot of people though... Browsers don't exist. They have "internet" and it's a "e"-shaped icon on their desktop.
[11:09:41] <arthurvr> At html5 boilerplate we’re planning to drop IE8 like next few months fyi :D
[11:09:45] <arthurvr> rcyr: totally right man
[11:09:59] <rcyr> arthurvr: Ah nice :)
[11:10:07] <arthurvr> It’s kinda stupid though why don’t we all download them a nice browser lol
[11:10:39] <arthurvr> Google just blocks their site for some browsers :)
[11:10:54] <rcyr> Because you become "that person" that gets contacted everytime the user has ___any___ computed-related issue.
[11:10:58] <dannylop> arthurvr: since you have used fullcalendar before, do you know how I can hide the days name on top and display 5 days in a row instead of defauly 7, i looked at their documentation but couldn't find anything sigh
[11:11:09] <dannylop> default*
[11:11:43] <arthurvr> Dunno but you’ll be able to figure that out really quickly from their source code :D
[11:13:18] <arthurvr> dannylop: It seems like they don’t have an option for that indeed.
[11:13:28] <arthurvr> https://github.com/arshaw/fullcalendar/blob/master/src/defaults.js is everything available.
[11:14:00] <dannylop> i searched all over their API page
[11:14:34] <arthurvr> You’re right, there’s no option I believe.
[11:14:36] <arthurvr> Kinda sad
[11:14:52] <arthurvr> Though it would be tricky for them to code in an option for that
[11:15:52] <gsoc-interest> hello guys
[11:17:03] <gsoc-interest> I need a team member are there any over here (im interested in google summer of code at the foundation)
[11:17:39] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: Hey! I'm a team member and would love to help you out. Can we head over to #jquery-dev?
[11:17:39] <gsoc-interest> okay but why
[11:17:40] <dannylop> am trying to look for in the source code
[11:18:14] <arthurvr> dannylop: Ther’s no option, you won’t find it :D It will be hard to change as all of their css depends on it (plus, all their js calculations)
[11:18:27] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: Development related chat should be over there.
[11:18:45] <arthurvr> This is more likely the support channel.
[11:19:07] <gsoc-interest> okay pleasure to meet you and let's move over
[11:19:27] <arthurvr> gsoc-interest: thanks
[11:21:23] <dannylop> arthurvr: yeah true..
[11:22:11] <arthurvr> dannylop: In an ideal world you would only need to change a variable and rebuild but yay
[11:24:13] <arthurvr> GitHub has been DDOS’d last 4 days so me had a pretty lazy day lol
[11:25:26] <dannylop> cool
[11:26:08] <rcyr> I wonder what's really behind these attacks on github...
[11:26:46] <arthurvr> you mean the reasoning? Mostly simply trolling or money, like, with every ddos isn’t it?
[11:26:58] <voidwalkr> what attacks on github?
[11:27:16] <arthurvr> They have been getting ddos’d for like 4 days now.
[11:27:29] <rcyr> I guess... but "some people" say that China would be behind it.
[11:27:44] <voidwalkr> ddos attacks seem to be common lately not just github
[11:27:54] <rcyr> I think it's BS... like last time with North Korea.
[11:27:56] <voidwalkr> quakelive server 2 months ago was down for like 4 days
[11:28:00] <arthurvr> It’s the worst as both github.com is doing stupid but probably even worse is that github pages is getting attacked too.
[11:28:01] <voidwalkr> due to ddos attacks
[11:28:19] <arthurvr> I mean like many important stuff for devs is hosted on Github pages :D
[11:28:43] <arthurvr> voidwalkr: They’re quite common yeah
[11:30:03] <arthurvr> And the worse is that you really can’t defense yourself in a good way
[11:30:24] <arthurvr> There are some workarounds but it’s basically the worst
[11:30:32] <voidwalkr> there are currently no countermeasures against ddos attacks?
[11:30:47] <arthurvr> There are but none are super effective
[11:30:55] <arthurvr> There are some tricks yeah
[11:32:25] <arthurvr> https://github.com/blog/1981-large-scale-ddos-attack-on-github-com for who’s interested
[11:34:24] <skypce> hey guys, why my code doesnt work?
[11:34:26] <skypce> 	$("a:visited").css('color','#988378');
[11:39:51] <dannylop> skypce: why not do this in css file?
[11:40:25] <arthurvr> Exaclty what dannylop said
[11:40:33] <arthurvr> ~exactly
[11:40:35] * arthurvr can’t type
[11:41:53] <skypce> dannylop, i was tried with css
[11:41:58] <skypce> but doesnt work
[11:42:05] <skypce> a:visited{color:red}
[11:42:12] <skypce> makes me all links red
[11:42:27] <skypce> i dont want that behaviour
[11:42:34] <arthurvr> skypce: Fiddle maybe?
[11:42:35] <arthurvr> !paste
[11:42:35] <b-ot> arthurvr: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:44:45] <dannylop> probably you didn't set a { color:# } then
[11:45:10] <dannylop> :visited is a pseudo class
[11:46:59] <livenet> so many app development frameworks. What do you all think I should use? angular ember react polymer backbone what ever
[11:47:15] <arthurvr> You should play around with all of them and see what fits your/your team’s way of thinking.
[11:48:16] <arthurvr> being a team member at todomvc I played around with nearly all of them and I only like a small amount of them. You will have that too, but with other frameworks lol
[11:48:38] <arthurvr> https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc - Basically the same app written in ~70 frameworks, have fun :)
[11:49:02] <arthurvr> Just pick the one you like and feel confortable with, don’t listen to what others say
[11:49:15] <arthurvr> expect if you work in a team of course :D
[11:49:33] <livenet> wow thanks arthurvr looking interesting. Does the rest agree
[11:50:15] <livenet> I used polymer for a while
[11:50:22] <livenet> looks awesome but feels bad
[11:50:39] <livenet> I don't want to follow what freakin' google thinks :D
[11:50:48] <livenet> Too linked to material design imho
[11:51:13] <arthurvr> livenet: Yeah, I tend to agree partially with that.
[11:51:33] <arthurvr> Though it’s all customizable
[11:51:44] <arthurvr> but you get material design kind of sorta already for free
[11:51:46] <arthurvr> lol
[11:52:26] <livenet> What's the most popular choice of that whole list these days?
[11:52:51] <arthurvr> I have no idea but probably backbone/ember/react/angular
[11:53:03] <arthurvr> What does the rest of the channel use (if any), just interested?
[11:54:10] <arthurvr> And react now has this really cool stuff by the way: http://www.reactnative.com/react-native-has-landed/
[11:54:21] <arthurvr> Toyed around with it and like it very much
[11:54:39] <livenet> okay thanks arthurvr
[11:55:00] <arthurvr> totally not #jquery related by the way :/
[12:15:23] <paulvd> jquery is so wonderful
[12:18:31] <arthurvr> paulvd: It is :D
[12:21:41] <paulvd> yeah
[12:21:50] <arthurvr> lol
[12:21:55] <paulvd> specially the debugging part
[12:22:13] <arthurvr> If you know how to use the tools properly there’s no problem at all :D
[12:22:19] <paulvd> ye
[12:23:03] <arthurvr> paulvd: https://vimeo.com/25698808
[12:23:28] <paulvd> so true !
[12:23:50] <paulvd> "At "Fixing These jQuery", you’ll understand how to approach your jQuery and JavaScript problems methodologically"
[12:24:02] <arthurvr> haha :D
[12:24:33] <paulvd> actually one learns more about it by debugging only
[12:44:19] <silverdust> I have a pseudo elment ::before styled to display properly but then I added a display: none
[12:45:08] <silverdust> I was trying to get it to show by haveing $('selector::before').show();
[12:45:13] <silverdust> *having
[12:45:43] <silverdust> but it doesn't work
[12:49:19] <hagabaka> silverdust: that's a pseudo element and you can only style them using CSS. You can't get a DOM/jQuery object of them and manipulate them. So manipulate the real element instead, like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5041494/manipulating-css-pseudo-elements-such-as-before-and-after-using-jquery
[12:49:40] <arthurvr> Exactly what hagabaka said ^
[12:50:21] <silverdust> so it'll be better to have an entirely different class with that pseudo element which I toggle
[12:50:56] <arthurvr> That’s a possible solution indeed.
[12:52:25] <silverdust> Thanks
[12:52:34] <arthurvr> yw silverdust
[13:14:15] <ndimatteo> Hey everyone, I’m having a really odd issue with implementing a masonry grid with jQuery. For some reason, no matter what I do, I cannot get it to reload when new items are added. It either a) Doesn’t every apply anything to the new items, or b) it keeps saying .masonry() is undefined. Would anyone be able to take a look? A second pair of eyes might help me figure out what I’m doing wrong.
[13:16:35] <ndimatteo> anyone?
[13:19:16] <MrStar> I have no idea what masonry is ..
[13:19:26] <MrStar> I use jquery datatables for tables etc.
[13:19:58] <ndimatteo> MrStar: It’s a jquery plugin by desandro
[13:20:00] <ndimatteo> https://github.com/desandro/masonry

[14:08:32] <AssassinsMod> is it possible to break an $.each ?
[14:16:40] <ailaG> Hi. I have an element that waits for the user to click specific things, and when they're all clicked it does something. Is a promise / deferred the best way to do that?
[14:16:51] <ailaG> It looks like it but I never used it for anything other than AJAX
[14:26:37] <testerbit> how can I delay this from executing by X amount of time? http://pastebin.com/zivHbhXj
[14:30:05] <MrStar> try using setTimeout perhaps?
[14:54:37] <AssassinsMod> i'm getting confused with piping, can't make it work http://jsbin.com/yeqenu/1/

[16:47:39] <jeffreylevesque> how do i check a json mimetype?
[16:48:01] <jeffreylevesque> application/json?
[16:52:06] <CiE> Sup guys i have a <script> </script> and i'm also pulling in jquery from a file, but i am cloning an element with events and there is one event i want to unbind or turn off. It's coming from the js file. I did var NAME = JQUERYHERE and when i do .unbind('change', NAME) i get an error that says it's not defined. Do i need to put something infront of NAME so it knows it's coming from the js file and not the script tags?

[20:08:45] <Whirled> quiet night, huh?
[20:17:51] <cyonder> I use this plugin : http://jqueryvalidation.org/ but I have a problem with it. If I put the js codes in .php file, it works but I wanna put it in .js file. When I do that, it stops working. Although, I include the js file to .php file
[21:37:40] <jeffmjack> anybody around?
[21:50:37] <jeffmjack> anybody know why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/4j5zgcua/
[21:54:24] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: you mean it like this? http://jsfiddle.net/4j5zgcua/
[21:54:29] <arthurvr> Some tiny syntax errors
[21:55:13] <arthurvr> whoops
[21:55:16] <arthurvr> better link: http://jsfiddle.net/4j5zgcua/1/
[21:55:31] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: ^
[21:55:41] <jeffmjack> ah yes, totally!
[21:56:10] <jeffmjack> also... this isn't really what i was curious about.. but why doesn't that blue handle div have a margin-top of 10px in the red div??
[21:56:31] <jeffmjack> ah
[21:56:39] <jeffmjack> was it just the {} for the handle?
[21:56:52] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: that margin is the space between the two red blocks.
[21:57:07] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: Also the closing brackets of your each() block.
[21:57:44] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: Just as an FYI, you would directly have catched that error using the devtools.

[22:00:41] <jeffmjack> thanks
[22:01:03] <jeffmjack> arthurvr: shouldn't the blue div also have a margin-top though?  It's a div after all
[22:01:35] <jeffmjack> I know that's not a jquery question, it's just unexpected behavior
[22:01:39] <arthurvr> jeffmjack: It does have that margin.
[22:01:45] <arthurvr> And that’s expected lol
[22:01:58] <jeffmjack> no, from the red container
[22:01:59] <arthurvr> As it’s in the same visual space of the margin of the outer div
[22:02:23] <jeffmjack> the nested div should have its own nested margin, right??
[22:03:17] <arthurvr> Nope in the margins can overlay eachother.
[22:05:16] <jeffmjack> weird
[23:41:06] <manzoor> Hi #jquery mobile.
[23:41:23] <manzoor> I have created a div with data-rel="popup" which I have directly defined under <body>
[23:41:31] <manzoor> because this popup will be common to all pages
[23:41:49] <manzoor> now when I do $('#myPopup').popup('open') it doesn't show up
[23:41:53] <manzoor> How do I fix this?
[23:42:05] <manzoor> I want to use a single/global/common popup for many pages.
[23:42:28] <manzoor> As there are a lot of pages, embedding the same popup to all pages doesn't seem a good solution.
[23:46:29] <manzoor> sorry it (i.e. the div) is actually a data-role="popup", my mistake.
[23:46:39] <manzoor> So how do I fix this?
