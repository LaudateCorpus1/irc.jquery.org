[06:27:08] <bonz060> Hi guys. Does anyone here have any experience working with opera mini? I've hit a wall on something I've inherited and I would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction.
[06:35:19] <thykka> bonz060, go ahead and ask the question first
[06:43:19] <Cork> bonz060: ask for something not someone or you're not likely to get any help
[06:48:21] <bonz060> Ok. thykka here's a snippet of the html I'm using https://pastebin.com/3GJaC0Jg I'll use javascript to append data to the `ul` tag. Here's the js: https://pastebin.com/HZj9h9U3
[06:48:54] <bonz060> The click event works on every browser except operamini, which has to be supported.
[06:49:21] <bonz060> I'm wondering if there's anything I'm missing.
[06:50:49] <bonz060> thykka: On opera mini it does not work when extreme mode is turned on. When it is in `high` or `automatic` mode, everything works fine.
[06:52:02] <bonz060> I want to add a click event to an object that is attached to dom using javascript. The click event for items attached to the dom using jquery are not working. Has anyone ever experienced this?
[06:53:22] <bonz060> \/s\/I'll use javascript\/I'm using javascript\/
[06:53:38] <bonz060> Any help would be highly appreciated.
[06:55:10] <bonz060> Cork: Thanks!
[06:55:48] <bonz060> Has anyone had any experience adding click events to dom items added using js for opera mini on extreme data savings mode?
[06:59:20] <thykka> bonz060, reading about Opera Mini, came across this:
[06:59:22] <thykka> > Until recently, event delegation didn’t work in Opera Mini. Now it’s implemented by the Server sending clickable areas to the client for anything with cursor:pointer
[06:59:31] <thykka> have you tried attaching the events directly?
[07:02:05] <thykka> I'd suggest trying with cursor: pointer first, then if that doesn't help, attach the event to each .remove separately, as they're added to the DOM
[07:13:38] <bonz060> Dumb question here... but how do you add `cursor:pointer`? Let me look into attaching an event separately. Thanks though :)
[07:14:44] <thykka> bonz060, It's a CSS rule
[07:15:04] <thykka> so in this case something like .remove { cursor: pointer; }
[07:24:34] <bonz060> Oh ok. Got it. Thanks! Lemme try it out.
[09:27:50] <PCatinean> Hey guys, can anyone tell me if it's possible to override a qunit test from another file?
[10:07:09] <Inazad> Hi there, I want to know how to init a datepicker when a modal is opened (modal with loaded content). I tried the code on the click function (to open the modal), do not work. If I try the code if the console when the modal is open, it works. What I did wrong ?
[10:12:12] <mindingmyown> Inazad, 'modal with loaded content' ? Does this mean that the content is loaded remotely? Therefore the html element that you're binding the datepicker to, arrives after the code to bind it has already been executed? So, you should init the datepicker using a callback function or something when the content loads?
[10:14:02] <Inazad> mindingmyown, can I use like $('#my-modal').on('load', function() { init the datepicker }); ?
[10:14:12] <Inazad> mindingmyown, yes its loaded from the same server yes
[10:15:42] <Inazad> but the onLoad do not work
[10:15:48] <Inazad> I cannot init it
[10:16:54] <thykka> Inazad, I assume you're loading the modal's contents with AJAX?
[10:17:37] <Inazad> yes
[10:17:42] <Inazad> there is a part of my code
[10:17:43] <Inazad> https://pastebin.com/UDgz90Gj
[10:18:07] <Inazad> I don't see the "Modal loaded" in the console
[10:18:24] <Inazad> and the "date picker" function not work.. but it works when using it into the console
[10:18:40] <Inazad> there is a way to execute this code on the .load() event ?
[10:19:02] <thykka> a 'load' event is not triggered on an element when an ajax request is completed. You should be using a complete function as a parameter for .load
[10:19:18] <Inazad> Ohh I see
[10:19:28] <Inazad> what should be the code instead ?
[10:19:46] <Inazad> cause .load is ".load( url [, data ] [, complete ] )"
[10:19:56] <Inazad> should I put the function in the "complete" ?
[10:20:13] <thykka> $('#ajax-modal').load(yourURL, function () { /* stuff that happens once the ajax is complete */  })
[10:21:19] <Inazad> what I put for [data] ?
[10:21:23] <Inazad> a simple var "data" ?
[10:21:23] <thykka> nothing
[10:21:28] <thykka> you can omit it
[10:21:42] <thykka> (that's what the [] signify)
[10:21:44] <Inazad> OK and can I do the datepicker jquery inside this function
[10:21:53] <thykka> right
[10:22:04] <Inazad> can I put the modal.show in this function too?
[10:22:15] <Inazad> or I have to do it after the load (outside the complete scope) ?
[10:22:23] <thykka> yes, if you only want it to become visible once the contents have loaded
[10:22:32] <Inazad> yes that what I want
[10:22:53] <thykka> ..sometimes one might want to display the modal with a loading spinner as soon as the loading starts
[10:23:24] <thykka> ....to signal the user that something is in fact happening, and that they should wait instead of frantically clicking the button again and again :)
[10:23:37] <Inazad> how I can show a loading gif ?
[10:23:45] <Inazad> there is my code now, should works ?  https://pastebin.com/ZY06x82Y
[10:23:56] <Inazad> ohh I forgot the variable
[10:24:27] <Inazad> yes it works ! amazing :-)
[10:24:54] <mindingmyown> Inazad, well done :)
[10:25:59] <thykka> Inazad, have an element that contains a spinner gif/a CSS animated loader/whatever, display it when you call $.load and hide it in the $.oad callback
[10:27:01] <Inazad> thykka, do you have an example cause I'm not so expert in Javascript
[10:27:33] <Inazad> instead of using $('#ajax-modal') in the load function completed, can I use 'this' ?
[10:27:43] <Inazad> cause it refers to himself
[10:27:53] <thykka> if you read that sentence with some thought, you should be able to implement it yourself. The operations described are really the most simple kinds of things one would do with jQuery
[10:28:15] <thykka> show the loader element when you start loading, hide it when you've stopped loading.
[10:28:16] <Inazad> OK I understand
[10:28:28] <Inazad> thank you for you helps
[10:28:31] <thykka> np!
[10:28:34] <Inazad> your help*
[10:29:00] <Inazad> ReactJS is a tought langage to learn ?
[10:29:23] <thykka> it's a library, not a language
[10:29:56] <thykka> ..although it does introduce it's own .jsx syntax, but using that is not strictly necessary
[10:31:52] <Inazad> why I hear that you have to learn from scratch
[10:32:07] <Inazad> like itsn't the same coding as "we learn"
[10:32:11] <Inazad> like PHP, HTML, CSS
[10:33:04] <thykka> you don't have to learn "from scratch", but working with libraries or frameworks might require tuning into a certain mindset regarding how things are done in that context
[10:34:25] <thykka> in react, you have a source of data and components that react to that data. It can be quite different from normal DOM manipulations
[11:00:06] <Cork> thykka++
[12:40:02] <PCatinean> Anyone know how one can replace the content of a loaded qunit test?
[12:40:22] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[12:42:36] <PCatinean> So I have a framework that generates widgets using js and then tests that precisely 5 elements are there with qunit
[12:42:57] <PCatinean> I made an override in that widget and added two other fields I need but now the original qunit test fails because it expects 5 instead of 7
[12:43:10] <PCatinean> And I wonder how I can override that as well so I can make the tests pass
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> i would need to see your code - i have the feeling you may be overcomplicating something somewhere :)
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> i might also rethink your test.
[12:45:03] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, very likely but here's the code
[12:46:04] <robertmaxrees> like - you're testing the output of the framework.  i wouldn't do that.  test that you're calling the framework with what you expect.
[12:46:05] <PCatinean> https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/11.0/addons/account/static/tests/reconciliation_tests.js#L590
[12:46:43] <PCatinean> And I have extended ReconciliationClientAction.StatementAction
[12:48:38] <PCatinean> Changing the output of it
[12:51:03] <PCatinean> Not that good with js or this qunit framework that's why i'm a bit lost here
[12:51:46] <robertmaxrees> i haven't messed with QUnit in a while so I'm super rusty.
[12:52:11] <PCatinean> The official documentatio on how to deal with this on the odoo framework does not help much either
[13:52:54] <PCatinean> So it seems that I was able to execute my block of code before the one that does the actual testing
[13:53:06] <PCatinean> I used the same QUnit.module and tried to skip it, to no avail
[14:21:51] <PCatinean> Anyone can lend a hand on Qunit tests in tandem with require?
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> happen to have a fiddle or anything that we cam play with?
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:08:00] <madprops> is element.data("something", something) async?
[20:08:22] <madprops> think im having some weird race conditions
[20:08:31] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:08:35] <robertmaxrees> it's synchronous
[20:08:44] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[20:09:55] <madprops> well it's with a game im making .. crashing when at very fast speed, have to check it further
[20:10:07] <madprops> it depends on .data()
[20:10:19] <madprops> but i doubt it's an async problem involving that t hen
[20:10:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[20:10:49] <robertmaxrees> your description makes me worried that you, like, made a platformer or something using plain ol' dom.
[20:11:01] <madprops> it's a tetris, with plain ol' dom
[20:11:13] <robertmaxrees> :|
[20:11:14] <madprops> doing it with canvas would be insane
[20:11:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:11:34] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/dionyziz/canvas-tetris ;)
[20:12:07] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason you avoid making games using the dom
[20:12:38] <madprops> cool. very simple though, for instance if you wanted to add animations/effects, it gets a lot harder with canvas
[20:12:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:13:00] <robertmaxrees> the alternative is a game that has performance issues/crashes ;)
[20:13:10] <madprops> well, for now, heh
[20:13:44] <robertmaxrees> becuase of how the DOM works, it's going to be *extremely difficult* for you to resolve them.  hence why most people don't use DOM for that kinda work.  but hey, your headaches :)
[20:18:22] <madprops> robertmaxrees, i'll show it to you when it's ready
[20:18:30] <robertmaxrees> lol it's all good ;)
