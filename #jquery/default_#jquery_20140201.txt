[01:46:36] <codephobic> hi
[01:47:35] <codephobic> I've made a little pagination utility (still working on polishing it up), would anyone be willing to look over the code and give me some feedback?
[01:48:55] <codephobic> Also, could someone explain how best to (and how to), integrate this utility with jquery so that if someone downloads it, they can just call it from any page which has the jquery and this utility urls.
[01:49:24] <codephobic> any takers?
[02:32:55] <codephobic> hi anyone home? I need some feedback on the utility I've developing there. It's not too big, around 100 lines of code, but it's my first attempt and I'd appreciate more experienced hands looking at it an giving it the once over. Thanks.
[02:33:14] <codephobic> http://www.joop.muchodesigns.com << the url
[03:02:59] <dnsdds> Is there some precedence of widgets depending on ui.mouse becoming unresponsive when in an AJAX-y environment?
[03:43:31] <xqo> hi, how can i bind a function to html5 video onended?
[03:43:52] <xqo> i tried $("#video").bind("ended", function() {alert("done");}); but it didnt work
[03:44:50] <ilhami> hey
[04:00:17] <decx> xqo i just tested bind('ended' and it worked fine
[04:00:39] <xqo> decx i found the error. the ended event never fires if your video is set to loop="true"
[04:01:03] <decx> that even makes sense
[04:15:57] <ilhami> okay dude :D
[05:11:08] <Ritzton> I have this kind of element in my page : <input type="checkbox" name="tab[]" /> it is not inside a form, how do you get it and serialize it for ajax sending ?
[06:01:17] <basiclaser> hey guys, does this code seem ok? :)
[06:01:21] <basiclaser> http://jsfiddle.net/basiclaser/4CqAt/8/
[06:12:38] <decx> don't do multilanguage that way basiclaser
[06:53:41] <basiclaser> how would you say 'Good for everyone, if you know what I can and cant do, I know exactly what you need before we start'
[06:54:30] <basiclaser> fuuu this isnt german
[07:04:29] <sedeki> how do I read get parameters with jquery? is this built in?
[07:12:37] <BillCriswell> sedeki: No. There's a few ways to accomplish it, though.
[07:19:26] <GoSox> I'm trying to make a single .submit( ) event handler, that does all the forms on a page
[07:19:47] <GoSox> so i need to references classes inside each form
[07:20:22] <GoSox> how would I select, for example, the "result" class inside "$(this)", which is the form that was just submitted
[07:24:17] <_rgn> $(this).find('.result')
[07:24:45] <GoSox> well thats pretty easy
[07:48:55] <GoSox> I guess not as easy as I thought. I have this statement, and its not working. I don't get any errors, simply nothing happens.
[07:48:57] <GoSox> $(this).find('.result').html($data).slideDown('fast');
[07:50:05] <decx> what does console.log($data) say about that?
[07:50:32] <GoSox> it prints all of the correct $data to the console, everything i'm trying to add to .result
[07:53:33] <GoSox> hmmmm
[07:53:51] <decx> is $data an object?
[07:54:06] <GoSox> $(this) changes inside of an anonymous callback function doesnt it
[07:54:15] <decx> yes
[07:57:05] <GoSox> so how can I pass 'this' on to the callback?
[07:58:07] <xaristax> save it on variable
[07:58:14] <decx> cache it beforehand with this = self or something
[08:02:05] <_rgn> callback.bind(this)
[08:29:33] <Lope> $('.foo').each(function(i,e) { ... is giving me elements in random order. How can I make the elements come through in the same order as they appear in the DOM?
[08:34:05] <Lope> okay I guess it's not jquery giving me the elements in DOM order. dunno what's causing it then.
[08:43:38] <tubiz> pls how do i implement adelete confirmation dialog using jquery
[08:47:41] <decx> either use a modal window or window.confirm
[08:57:38] <seoNinjaWarrior> if there is a parent window with 2 iframes, can 1 of those iframes trigger a javascript event in the other iframe -- if all 3 are on the same domain?
[09:04:38] <asa_c> Hi, is it possible to define & merge some global post params with different requests using $.ajax?
[09:05:38] <ravenzz> asa_c like any ajax request?
[09:06:13] <asa_c> ravenzz yes as long as its using "post"
[09:07:33] <ravenzz> well you could define an interface that uses $.ajax
[09:07:36] <ravenzz> like a proxy function
[09:09:08] <asa_c> ravenzz I think it is possible with  Amplify JS request plugin but when I used Serialize array it posted differently to $.ajax
[09:11:33] <asa_c> 0[name] action 0 [value]	login instead of action login
[09:25:28] <seoNinjaWarrior> if there is a parent window with 2 iframes, can 1 of those iframes trigger a javascript event in the other iframe -- if all 3 are on the same domain?
[09:38:01] <Ash__> hello can anyone help?
[09:39:15] <Ash__> hello i am having a major problem can anyone help please?
[09:47:00] <Siecje> How do I submit an input on change
[09:47:48] <Siecje> how do you get the form of an input, or how do you get the next input in the dom (which is type=submit
[09:55:03] <decx> Siecje $('input').closest("form);
[09:55:11] <decx> 'form'
[09:56:49] <decx> $('input').next('input') only works if it's actually the next element ie <input type="text" name="myinput"><input type="text" name="mynextinput">
[09:57:31] <Siecje> yeah it would be thanks
[09:57:55] <Siecje> but the closest form works as well
[10:01:14] <evilbug> yo.
[10:02:50] <decx> Siecje i forgot there's actually a something in native javascript for that this.form
[10:03:20] <decx> so you can use $(this.form).attr('action') to get the action of the form inside the function for an input for example
[10:04:12] <decx> ie http://jsfiddle.net/decx/krt7x/
[10:32:24] <evilbug> jphase: what up, player?
[10:36:34] <lakcaj> Hello.  I'd like to create an interface similar to this: http://i.imgur.com/slO9bzR.png   where it is a full-page app with sections that can be resized.  I can't seem to find the appropriate library to use.
[10:39:15] <evilbug> lakcaj: regular jquery would do the trick.
[10:41:00] <evilbug> lakcaj: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[10:43:00] <lakcaj> evilbug, the individual sections can be resized within the browser window
[10:43:52] <evilbug> lakcaj: not sure if that's a question but that's what .resize() does. you can't resize whatever elements you want.
[10:46:30] <lakcaj> evilbug, I'm not sure how "resize" gives me draggable anchors to resize the various sections of a page.  Maybe I'm just missing something.
[10:47:04] <decx> doesn't really matter what you use to implement a handlebar function to resize areas in an app, but i'd suggest you dive into something like angular or any other soup du jour js-app library because the performance, and handling all the views in something liek this with jquery is most likely going to be ass
[10:49:07] <lakcaj> decx, I really wish angular was around when this app was initially created.  Right now I'm just trying to clean up the browser UI to make it easier on the user.
[10:49:45] <decx> well you have my condolences ;)
[10:50:32] <evilbug> lakcaj: wouldn't it just be easier to remake the whole thing with modern frameworks and such instead of frankensteining a bunch of new and old stuff together like that?
[10:51:26] <basiclaser> i can haz suggestions for js/jquery tutorials? I'm looking to build up to a point where im informed enough to use nodejs ! :)
[10:52:09] <decx> evilbug in business you're not going to abandon an existing codebase where thousands of dev hours have been invested already, that's why i have to use a backend with a frameset, it's terrible for devs but understandable from a business perspective
[10:52:20] <lakcaj> afaik, angular is not a ui toolkit, and doesn't really provide any frontend widgets or anything like that.  So, whatever I use for the communication between the client and server, I have to use some sort of UI toolkit.
[10:54:16] <lakcaj> Whatever MVC-ish framework I'm using for client-server data communications is not the question.  I'm asking about a robust UI toolkit for building the frontend interface.
[10:55:01] <evilbug> decx: i can understand that but there's always a chance that's not the case.
[10:57:20] <decx> lakcaj well there's resizable in jq ui which has this kind of functionality out of the box, but then you have to deal with jq ui
[10:59:08] <lakcaj> decx, thanks - that looks close to what I'm after.
[11:00:21] <lakcaj> decx, do you have a suggestion instead of jquery ui?  There really aren't a lot of widgets in the app except a multi-select and a ckeditor
[11:05:55] <decx> lakcaj you can always just cut out the resizable function from jq ui ;)
[11:25:57] <zatan> hey  I have got this string "orderline_set-0-service" how can I remove word service and replace with something else ?
[11:26:54] <decx> s.replace('service','newword')
[11:28:29] <zatan> decx, but not always going to be last word service
[11:29:03] <decx> you can feed it variables
[11:29:49] <zatan> decx, great cheers
[11:32:54] <ModDish2> I have a string, that contains text spaces numbers etc, im trying to make an array of all the numbers and remove everything else .  example sting 500  --something -- -1500     problem is it returns 500,1500 in the array  want it to keep the negitive numbers negitive    code is   array=txt.match(/(?!$)\d+(\.\d+)/g);    what do i need to do to keep the negitive numbers and positive numbers of
[11:32:54] <ModDish2> the string in an array but remove everything else
[11:34:44] <linux_daemon> can anyone tell me why doesnt this loads nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/5XWX5/
[11:36:04] <ModDish> anyone?
[11:36:56] <decx> ModDish i'm sure there's a more active programming specific channel with regex pros, it ain't me alright ;)
[11:38:24] <ModDish> decx thanks for looking man, this thing is driving me nuts lol...one thing i can never get with php and this is getting matches with regex
[11:38:44] <decx> try #javascript imho
[11:38:57] <ModDish> k thanks :)
[11:39:12] <linux_daemon> can anyone tell me why doesnt this loads nothing? http://jsfiddle.net/5XWX5/
[11:40:17] <decx> linux_daemon hard to tell, js fiddle wont work with your php and you put a script tag in the script window
[11:40:19] <Voyage> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21500252/geting-html-data-from-embedded-browser-in-android-and-ios
[11:40:23] <Voyage> any clue?
[11:41:11] <decx> linux_daemon http://jsfiddle.net/decx/5XWX5/2/
[11:42:11] <ModDish> decx  any chance you know a better way of trying to do what i want to accomplish?  basically make an array of all positive and negitive numbers from a string of text
[11:42:24] <linux_daemon> decx, that is supposed to load from database
[11:42:37] <linux_daemon> i dont need json
[11:42:59] <decx> ModDish i'm sure there's some regex magic that i'll never hope to understand to accomplish that
[11:43:28] <decx> linux_daemon the json echo is just to test the load, jsfiddle can't load from your server
[11:43:48] <linux_daemon> i know, but is there any error in my code so it fails to load?
[11:43:59] <ModDish> linux_daemon does the database cars contain a type column
[11:44:41] <decx> the error could be in any place really, from a typo to a backend problem, you'll have more control if you us .get or .ajax instead of load
[11:49:36] <linux_daemon> decx, found it, it was a typo
[11:49:50] <decx> ha !
[12:01:03] <arunjit> has anyone hit an issue where a plugin.. disappears?
[12:02:05] <arunjit> that is, when the execution reaches the place where it's used $('...').pluginname(), $.fn.pluginname is undefined?
[12:07:07] <linux_daemon> is there any way do create option before i invoke the .load method here: http://jsfiddle.net/ctW3z/
[12:25:49] <evilbug> i need help with jquery! heeeeeeeeeeelp!
[12:28:50] <HenryCH> Does anyone use a free webhost that they would recommend?
[12:57:00] <alaing> quiet here
[13:03:11] <evilbug> alaing: very quiet.
[13:03:29] <alaing> really like to help someone
[13:03:40] <evilbug> alaing: help me.
[13:03:46] <alaing> with?
[13:03:57] <evilbug> i got some furniture that needs to be moved around.
[13:04:08] <evilbug> piercedwater: oh look who it is.
[13:04:16] <alaing> sorry only do massages and jquery....
[13:05:22] <evilbug> alaing: actually i have a an issue with this responsive nav. technically it works but say i keep it expanded on small browser width and then make my browser large, the slideToggle behaves weird when resized again to small width.
[13:06:22] <evilbug> it shows expanded and when clicked on the toggle the nav slides up then down again. it's not supposed to do that.
[13:06:33] <alaing> only on pc?
[13:06:39] <evilbug> on firefox.
[13:06:46] <alaing> and ie?
[13:06:49] <evilbug> well any browser actually, does that on ym phone too.
[13:06:51] <alaing> or chrome?
[13:07:13] <evilbug> let me do a quick codepen.
[13:07:24] <alaing> i was just wondering if you needed to listen for window resizing
[13:07:29] <alaing> but if its also on mobile
[13:07:37] <alaing> thats a bit poitnless
[13:09:58] <evilbug> alaing: here's the js for it > http://pastebin.com/NK6XY5Va
[13:09:58] <evilbug> am i missing anything?
[13:10:23] <Spindel> LinkedIn have a dropdown pm inbox item in their menu. How do I make something similar with jquery? :)
[13:10:46] <Spindel> I want to load in content from another page when holding mouse over menu item button
[13:11:05] <Spindel> in a small square, like LinkedIn pm-popup/square
[13:12:59] <linux_daemon> this: http://jsfiddle.net/zH9Sx/ . why do i get the submit attribute disabled?
[13:13:11] <linux_daemon> even if the two vars are set to yes
[13:14:21] <alaing> linux_daemon: just taking a look
[13:14:44] <alaing> evilbug: can you try get a jsfiddel example up?
[13:15:13] <znf> Hello. I have a simple question regarding ajax and http servers; Would browsers usually keep-alive a connection initiated with an ajax request? I have a script that hits a specific URL every ~10 seconds, and my server is getting a bit hammered by having ~200+ child processes (for a single file)
[13:15:14] <linux_daemon> i still dont get why i dont get removeAttr
[13:16:17] <snover> znf: yes
[13:16:18] <alaing> linux_daemon: do you want to disable the submit? what jquery version are you using?
[13:16:29] <evilbug> alaing: yeah, one minute.
[13:16:40] <linux_daemon> the latest one befor version 2...
[13:16:46] <alaing> znf have a look at websockets
[13:16:46] <linux_daemon> 1.10 i think
[13:17:11] <alaing> linux_daemon: ah so you having to support ie7+8
[13:18:44] <linux_daemon> yeah, thats not the issue now, what i was trying to do iswhen i have the load functions done, give a var that has the value yes, and after the two loads, both the vars are having the value yes and the submit button is no longer disabled
[13:20:05] <linux_daemon> why is the code behaving that way?
[13:20:15] <alaing> linux_daemon: I think you need to use .prop() instead of .attr()
[13:20:52] <alaing> linux_daemon: http://jsfiddle.net/zH9Sx/1/
[13:22:01] <linux_daemon> nope, still disabled
[13:23:14] <alaing> linux_daemon: can you add more html to your example? like some values etc because I cant test it further
[13:23:39] <alaing> linux_daemon: did you try the .removeProp()?
[13:24:23] <linux_daemon> well the values i get are values from a db
[13:26:08] <alaing> linux_daemon: it looks like you just copied it form php
[13:26:27] <alaing> try running the page, viewing the source and then copying the html form that
[13:26:57] <znf> alaing, is there a way to fallback from websockets to using ajax with jquery?
[13:28:03] <linux_daemon> well tried that, and the button still doesnt have the disabled option but it is still disabled
[13:28:06] <alaing> znf not 100% sure try google. Basically websockets push data down to the client instead of you having to constantly "ping" via ajax to your server
[13:28:31] <alaing> linux_daemon: copy the source to jsfiddle
[13:29:11] <alaing> linux_daemon: does it work when you change the select list after the page loads??
[13:30:12] <linux_daemon> the attribute disabled doesnt go away , but the .load works fine. here is the source: http://jsfiddle.net/hEebx/
[13:30:46] <znf> alaing, another silly question, I have used mostly jsonp in this project (it's polling data from different servers that can't provide Access-Control-Allow-Origin). Would jsonp over websockets work properly?
[13:32:03] <alaing> znf: again not sure. I understand the basic concept/need for websockets but thats it. I do play to get my head around it as I can see it being useful for a lot of things
[13:32:22] <znf> alaing, thanks for the input.
[13:32:24] <shoky> znf i highly doubt that. jsonp = load data using a <script> tag
[13:32:58] <vinky> znf, there are abstraction libraries that falls back to ajax from websockets
[13:33:10] <znf> yeah, I found this: https://code.google.com/p/jquery-graceful-websocket/
[13:35:40] <linux_daemon> alaing?
[13:35:48] <alaing> yes
[13:38:35] <linux_daemon> i sent you the source code
[13:38:39] <evilbug> alaing: it's giving me different issues in codepen as well > http://codepen.io/anon/pen/sukzD
[13:38:52] <alaing> linux_daemon: looking at it
[13:40:11] <alaing> linux_daemon: why are you setting those to vars directly after your .load()?
[13:41:01] <alaing> linux_daemon: does your code work as expect after the webpage first loads...like before you change any select lists
[13:45:48] <linux_daemon> initialy, the submit is disabled, but even after the two conditions, it still stays disabled
[13:46:28] <alaing> linux_daemon: thats because when the page loads it doesn't trigger the .change() code
[13:47:11] <alaing> linux_daemon: are you just setting it to check that the select lists are populated?
[13:50:20] <alaing> linux_daemon: try http://jsfiddle.net/hEebx/1/
[13:50:50] <evilbug> alaing: ?
[13:51:07] <alaing> evilbug: looking at it
[14:06:04] <evilbug> alaing: i'm runnin jquery 2.1 on the site btw.
[14:07:41] <alaing> sorry evilbug i'm not sure
[14:07:49] <alaing> does seem rather odd
[14:09:04] <evilbug> yeah, right? X_X
[14:09:23] <evilbug> alaing: the jquery i'm using is correct though, right?
[14:10:36] <alaing> It doesn't seem to bee screaming anything to obvious
[14:10:57] <evilbug> alaing: could it be jquery version?
[14:12:21] <alaing> well with codepen, they are actually using jqury 1.11
[14:14:29] <evilbug> alaing: i hate the world!
[14:14:32] <rivarun> hey all. i'd like to prefetch a page including its pictures (or whatever else it contains). at the moment all that's available to me is the url to the page. is there a way to do this?
[14:15:08] <alaing> evilbug: http://jsfiddle.net/g6tbm/
[14:15:43] <alaing> evilbug: jsfiddle version which is using 2.1
[14:17:02] <evilbug> alaing: ok, give me a minute to look at this.
[14:17:24] <alaing> nothign different apart from its using the same jquery version as you
[14:20:10] <alaing> hmmm somethign odd is happening
[14:20:19] <alaing> I managed to get it to not bounce
[14:20:30] <alaing> by adding a duration
[14:20:42] <alaing> but it still bounces when you resize
[14:21:30] <decx> you shouldn't use that click inside a resize
[14:23:31] <alaing> decx: ah, spot on....
[14:24:03] <bumbar> could someone explain what i'm doing wrong here https://dpaste.de/hQ5e (form variable is string with html code in it)
[14:24:08] <alaing> not sure if you want to trigger it
[14:26:32] <decx> in rebinds the event every time doesnt it?
[14:27:52] <alaing> bumbar: https://dpaste.de/OpNz
[14:28:27] <alaing> bumbar: try caching you selectors and chain the methods....thats one of jQuery quicks
[14:29:09] <decx> what was the problem with that menu trigger btw?
[14:29:13] <alaing> bumbar you didn't acutally sya what was wrong
[14:29:37] <alaing> anyway i'm calling it a night
[14:29:52] <evilbug> alaing: one minute please
[14:30:04] <evilbug> here's an update > http://jsfiddle.net/g6tbm/7/
[14:30:30] <evilbug> alaing: main change being the media queries in the css.
[14:30:56] <alaing> you need to move the binding of the click event out of the resize event
[14:31:20] <alaing> basically everytime you resize the window you binding the click
[14:31:31] <alaing> which means its called multipe times
[14:31:36] <alaing> causing it to "bouncE"
[14:31:54] <alaing> thats why it works first time and then fails when you resize
[14:32:11] <decx> evilbug http://jsfiddle.net/decx/g6tbm/8/
[14:33:23] <decx> maybe even cache window and put it in a function that you can call on your nav element
[14:33:31] <alaing> cheers guys
[14:33:36] <evilbug> alaing, decx: thank you (jquery noob).
[14:33:40] <evilbug> alaing: a bientot.
[14:33:55] <alaing> evilbug: no problem and good luck
[14:34:02] <decx> bye
[14:35:22] <evilbug> decx: this is doing my head in! X_X
[14:38:43] <decx> what's the problem evilbug?
[15:05:27] <evilbug> decx: just new to js and getting all these bugs is killing me.
[15:05:55] <evilbug> decx: thanks for the help though, i'll wrap my head around what you and alaing suggested.
[16:09:25] <morenoh149> What's the best way to achieve a horizontal scroll effect on a website?
[16:54:22] <omg|its|otr> For some reason, selecting a div via its ID isn't working, but selecting it via class is. http://jsfiddle.net/a6zwp/
[16:54:37] <omg|its|otr> That's my JSfiddle. the problem is incredibly trivial and I can't figure out why it's not working the way i expect.
[16:55:42] <shoky> omg|its|otr it's because of the weird quotes i think
[16:55:51] <shoky> see what jsfiddle marks red
[16:57:03] <shoky> omg|its|otr hm also the >  signs are weird
[16:58:09] <shoky> mm and the spaces ;p
[16:58:32] <shoky> use a normal editor/os/whatever :\
[16:59:58] <omg|its|otr> shoky, I retyped it all manulaly and it worked.
[17:00:21] <shoky> yap
[17:00:22] <omg|its|otr> I had copied and pasted this from an email I was sent.
[17:01:16] <Vivekananda> hey everyone. I just finished an entire jquery tutorial and sadly realized it wont help :(
[17:02:04] <Vivekananda> I found some nifty tricks but I did not find things like  source:  and .get() and such keywords. I am guessing that is basic javascript
[17:03:06] <shoky> Vivekananda no it depends which 'source' and .get() you're talking about.. jquery has $.get for an ajax GET request.
[17:03:27] <shoky> jquery-ui autocomplete has a 'source' option.. other things do too
[17:03:41] <shoky> `api $.get
[17:03:41] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[17:03:44] <shoky> `api get
[17:03:46] <b-ot> shoky: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[17:03:52] <shoky> er
[17:04:02] <shoky> `api jquery.get
[17:04:02] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.get(): Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[17:04:03] <Vivekananda> shoky: okay then I guess I am talking about that.
[17:04:20] <shoky> if you have a specific question.. you can ask
[17:04:50] <Vivekananda> shoky: I had a question two days ago and people suggested I should first learn basics of jquery before asking
[17:05:24] <Vivekananda> here I am having finished codeacademy jquery fully and though I understand some parts I am still stuck with some ie the things I did not find in there
[17:05:51] <tw2113> wha? codeacademy isn't the endall beall jquery well of knowhow?
[17:05:53] <Vivekananda> eg http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote  if you look at this example source code I understand the basic structure but I dont know the usage of some things in it to be confident
[17:06:06] <Vivekananda> tw2113: certainly not but is a good start right ?
[17:06:25] <tw2113> do you feel like you got a good start for general stuff?
[17:06:29] <shoky> well like i said. if you have a specific question.. you can ask
[17:06:30] <Vivekananda> I wanted to know a basic understanding of fundamental constructs
[17:06:58] <Vivekananda> tw2113: I think so. I understand basic structure and can create 2 , 3 level nestings ( basic ones )
[17:07:11] <Vivekananda> shoky: yep am getting to it
[17:07:14] <shoky> you can create nestings?
[17:07:43] <Vivekananda> shoky: I mean nested function calls yes . something wrong in what I said ?
[17:08:05] <shoky> no.. just a weird thing to say ;p
[17:08:19] <shoky> { { { { { { { } } } } } } } } }
[17:08:27] <shoky> there , i created a 7 level nesting.
[17:08:29] <shoky> or something.
[17:08:33] <Vivekananda> I was trying to convey I understand a bit of complexity of the creations ( no big deal in hindsight I know )
[17:08:44] <tw2113> stop objectifying shoky
[17:08:54] <Vivekananda> okay so my question / s
[17:08:56] <shoky> its what i do
[17:10:45] <Vivekananda> http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote this example has code parts of which are unfamiliar to me still. I want to understand better how "source:" is used. My ultimate aim a little different though but I will take it in turn
[17:11:08] <shoky> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[17:11:13] <shoky> that's the docs for 'source'
[17:11:26] <shoky> you'll need to be more specific if you want an actual answer
[17:12:53] <Vivekananda> shoky: I know but before that I want to be able to troubleshoot such knowledge gaps on my own
[17:13:21] <shoky> you haven't specified any gaps
[17:13:28] <decx> source in autocomplete is just an array of words and it's best to keep it that way when you start out
[17:13:43] <shoky> that, or do what the docs say
[17:13:43] <decx> calling a source function is a bit rough to start out with
[17:14:00] <decx> because you need a fitting backend for that
[17:14:28] <shoky> he wants to know about source, why tell him not to use it..
[17:15:31] <decx> because source = ['my','autocomplete','words'] is easier to grasp then requesting a json and nesting they query in there
[17:15:45] <decx> than* yikes
[17:17:05] <shoky> like he said he's a pro nester ;p
[17:17:24] <Vivekananda> decx: lol uncannily my actual problem deals with getting a json and parsing it and displaying the result :)
[17:18:05] <decx> ha
[17:18:40] <Vivekananda> but before I get to that I will spend some time going over the document link for those examples and understand how the code works and what parts of it mean
[17:18:48] <Vivekananda> I understand some and fuzzy about some
[17:19:39] <decx> well prepare to be dazzled, you're going to be nesting so deep you'll grow feathers
[17:20:24] <decx> source function { ajax { success { map { label&keys
[17:20:31] <Vivekananda> decx: would love to be dazzled. I just hope people here arent so ruffled before I am dazzled that they drop me mid air
[17:24:57] <decx> i've actually been looking at typeahead.js from twitter as a jq ui autocomplete replacement
[17:25:06] <decx> looks pretty damn sweet
[17:29:15] <Vivekananda> in this page http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source looking at the code examples for appendTo I want to ask why can the appendto not be used to the class ".selector" itself ? does it Necessarily need an element?
[17:30:41] <Lope> I want to copy the DOM to a string. when I use pure JS like this I don't get the values of my input elements? document.documentElement.outerHTML
[17:30:44] <Vivekananda> I got this http://api.jquery.com/appendto/ though
[17:30:54] <Lope> how can I grab the HTML as it is with jQuery
[17:33:29] <Vivekananda> Lope: use an id ?
[17:33:58] <Vivekananda> I am new to this too but I would try that and of course someone will correct me if I am wrong
[17:34:30] <Vivekananda> from what little I know you convert an element into an object ( and grab it ) but doing $('element') in jquery
[17:34:54] <Vivekananda> $(document) without quote catches the whole doc
[17:35:13] <Lope> I tried that
[17:35:32] <Lope> $(document).prop('outerHTML') it excluded the body. it only grabbed the head
[17:36:41] <Vivekananda> hmm what is your aim ?
[17:37:09] <shoky> Vivekananda: the appendTo option says that it accepts a "Selector", so you can use ".selector" if you want
[17:37:57] <Vivekananda> shoky: so this would be okay then ? -- $( ".selector" ).autocomplete({ appendTo: ".selector" });  ?
[17:38:26] <shoky> if it makes sense to append it to that, sure..
[17:40:44] <shoky> Lope the HTML representation of the DOM only contains attributes, not properties. and the runtime value of inputs is in a property, not an attribute. so you can't get them like that
[17:43:10] <Vivekananda> shoky: does that mean that ( for what you said to lope) if there is a checkbox and it is checked then the value checked/unchecked is part of a property and hence cannot be obtained by a jquery ?
[17:43:37] <shoky> it can be obtained, just not with .html() or .outerHTML
[17:43:55] <shoky> (or .innerHTML)
[17:44:49] <crystal77> Can someone shed some light on what I'm doing wrong? I've a table. All I want, are the odd rows, first column. That's it. I'm 90% there. http://jsfiddle.net/23kWG/
[17:47:03] <shoky> crystal77: you're just adding a class to the <td>s
[17:47:09] <shoky> it's working fine
[17:48:04] <crystal77> Yeah. And then I do $(".test123").text(); in console, and it's one giant string.
[17:48:23] <shoky> that's what .text() gives
[17:48:32] <shoky> what do you want?
[17:48:37] <crystal77> I chose numbers for the example, but they're name. So write now, I get "paulbobjimchaseadriannasmith" etc.
[17:48:46] <shoky> oh you want spaces..
[17:48:47] <crystal77> Can't even tell where the first name ends, and where the next begins, haha
[17:49:12] <crystal77> Yeah, I tried .after(" ");, but that didn't work :\
[17:50:01] <shoky> crystal77: $(".test123").map(function() { return $(this).text() }).get().join(' ')
[17:50:26] <crystal77> Perfect!
[17:50:50] <crystal77> I've no idea what that code does, but whatever. #yolo - I'll reverse engineer it.
[17:51:42] <Vivekananda> I have one confusion in this code http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories . Line 49 defines source but where is this source then put in code from line 20 onwards ?
[17:51:53] <shoky> gets an array of texts and joins it with spaces
[17:52:02] <decx> crystal77 there are several test123 elements inside $('.test123'), map goes through them one by one and adds a space
[17:52:22] <crystal77> Gotcha. :3
[17:52:44] <shoky> Vivekananda it's used by the autocomplete widget
[17:53:08] <shoky> that line doesn't define source, it just sets the source option
[17:53:58] <Vivekananda> doesnt that line ( 49 ) mean that the source is going to be the data  variable ?
[17:54:18] <shoky> yes, it sets the source option to that data
[17:56:38] <Vivekananda> good so now on what line the widget is getting that data and on what line does it start USing it ? is the usage Starting on line 20 ? if so what is ul doing there ?I thought ul referes to a table line or something
[17:57:31] <shoky> Vivekananda it uses it internally, in the jquery-ui code
[17:58:45] <shoky> and jquery-ui internal code calls the _renderMenu callback, passing in the items to render
[17:59:06] <Vivekananda> so items = data then ?
[17:59:09] <shoky> but this is a kinda advanced example, you don't really need to fully understand it now
[17:59:22] <Vivekananda> shoky: I would still like to understand it
[17:59:34] <shoky> no, items = the part of the data that matches the user's current input
[18:03:29] <shoky> oh, and 'ul' refers to the menu <ul>
[18:04:00] <Vivekananda> shoky: it there a way to understand or dissect where the data ( which is an associative array) gets broken and manupulated. I need this info coz I have a similar situation and I want different keys + value  groups to show up in different colors in my code
[18:04:08] <Vivekananda> if all that is behind the scene then I am lost
[18:05:38] <shoky> it's internally.. but mm it's not hard to "disect" such data
[18:06:02] <shoky> $.each $.map $.grep can help
[18:07:06] <kegster> anyone use piwik?
[18:07:24] <kegster> oops wrong channel
[18:07:29] <kegster> wait nvm right channel
[18:08:15] <shoky> wrong question, then
[18:11:28] <Vivekananda> okay looking at those
[18:11:55] <Vivekananda> I have a variable called data ( an associative array) and want to dissect and do stuff with it
[18:12:53] <shoky> make a jsfiddle
[18:13:02] <shoky> be specific..
[18:28:43] <alleZSoyez> does anyone know how to animate sprites with jQuery? I wrote a function to attempt it but it doesn't seem to work
[18:59:58] <sacrebleu> I'm trying to understand this example for the spectrum color picker, where it refers to the .on but offers an example that makes no sense.  http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/   see section "dragstop"
[19:00:20] <sacrebleu> it shows an example that is not valid js/jq
[19:00:27] <sacrebleu> $(element).on("dragstart.spectrum"): function(e, color) {
[19:00:27] <sacrebleu>     color.toHexString(); // #ff0000
[19:00:46] <sacrebleu> the : after the .on is what breaks it
[19:01:15] <sacrebleu> when I move the function into the .on("dragstart.spectrum",function(e,color){...}); it doesn't seem to trigger it
[19:03:58] <sacrebleu> hello?
[19:04:09] <evilbug> quois?
[19:04:18] <evilbug> sacrebleu.
[19:04:25] <sacrebleu> evilbug
[19:04:27] <evilbug> quelle derange.
[19:05:00] <sacrebleu> i dont understand this type of event
[19:05:08] <sacrebleu> i am looking at the page but cannot see where the event is customized
[19:05:14] <evilbug> me neither, i just started working with js.
[19:11:20] <sacrebleu> ok i think i figured it out but it doesn't get triggered .. can anyone shed some light?
[19:17:14] <sacrebleu> is there some special thing to watch events in jquery plugins
[19:24:01] <gordian> guys i have an AJAX submit function in one file which i can't edit, but i'd like to perform an action when i receive a header response in another file. is that possible? if so, how?
[19:24:35] <gordian> to clarify–i want to perform an action in a second file as a result of the AJAX request sent in the first file
[19:24:52] <gordian> any ideas?
[19:29:24] <Vivekananda> anyone around. I have started to work on a fiddle
[19:29:26] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/2/
[19:30:03] <sacrebleu> Vive
[19:30:09] <sacrebleu> tit for tat, will you help my issue first?
[19:30:32] <Vivekananda> sacrebleu: lol we can both try. I am new
[19:30:39] <Vivekananda> dont know much but will try
[19:30:55] <sacrebleu> I'm trying to understand this example for the spectrum color picker, where it refers to the .on but offers an example that makes no sense.  http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/   see section "dragstop"
[19:31:06] <sacrebleu> so i figured out how to set the on event properly but it doesn't trigger
[19:34:55] <BillCriswell> Vivekananda: results is messed up. Not sure what you were shooting for there.
[19:36:35] <BillCriswell> sacrebleu: I think they were shooting for $(element).on("dragstart.spectrum", function(e, color) { ... });
[19:42:38] <sacrebleu> BillCriswell: interesting
[19:42:52] <sacrebleu> crap he left
[19:43:04] <sacrebleu> well that's not what i was asking
[19:43:48] <sacrebleu> <script>var color_picked="#FFFFFF"; $(function() { $( "#picker" ).spectrum({flat:true,showInput:false,showButtons:false,color:"orange"}).on("dragstop.spectrum", function(e,c) { color_picked=c.toHexString(); console.log(c.toHexString()); }); });</script>
[19:44:02] <sacrebleu> ^^  http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/
[19:44:09] <sacrebleu> dragstop event, never triggers
[19:44:21] <sacrebleu> on their own example page I can't even see where the code is that does that event in their example
[20:13:48] <sacrebleu> http://jsfiddle.net/UU9dC/ <- why does dragstop event not trigger?
[20:14:08] <sacrebleu> er hmm it  seems to
[20:26:48] <sacrebleu> http://jsfiddle.net/UU9dC/4/ <- why does the event trigger the console only none of the other things
[20:44:10] <evilbug> decx: what up, player?
[21:12:30] <Vivekananda> I have created a fiddle and trying to work on it. Currently it does not display the search text box it should. Also I am trying to keep the structure as I have it in there for my own reasons -- http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/2/
[22:59:21] <morenoh149> What's the cheapest way to achieve a horizontally scrolling webpage?
[23:24:14] <boltR> is there something similar to jquery's end() that can execute a callback?
[23:25:07] <boltR> actually not similar to end()... didn't understand what it really did
[23:26:55] <boltR> i'm looking for something to chain between jquery functions
[23:27:02] <boltR> kind of like a then() in a promise
