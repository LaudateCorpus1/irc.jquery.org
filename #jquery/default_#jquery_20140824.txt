[00:01:54] <amh345> Im trying to do some refactoring on my shopping cart.  one of the things i would like to do is store the product_ids/quantities that users select in a cookie. and then when they get to the checkout page i read the cookie and populate the form with the product data and submit. I'm also thinking that i'll need to update the quantities and remove items from the cookie. would saving this data in json be the way to go?  or is there a more ideal way of storin
[00:01:54] <amh345> this data in a cookie and then looking it up/modifying it.
[00:35:24] <calvincanas> hello, any recommended scrollspy(standalone ) ?
[03:09:12] <dokma> hmmm.... IE8 doesn't move the elements below when I add something above so they end up on top of eachother...
[03:09:20] <dokma> is there any way to tell IE to redraw?
[03:12:51] <systemfault> You must be doing something weird..
[03:13:06] <systemfault> What the Hell with the spamming bots these days?
[04:08:10] <opstad> I have a <div id=«button»></div> area where I have six buttons. Upon click, I verify if the correct button is clicked, and six new buttons are generated from another php file through the jQuery post method. The six new buttons are not handled by the jquery $(‘#button’).click(function()) …. does the script only apply to tags within the original php file and not new tags created by another phpfile through jquery post?
[04:34:49] <jop008> Hi I have this thing http://pastebin.com/3TyqptRa how to set up the bind function. Firing this code complains that e event is empty but the event click is not yet fired
[04:45:55] <jop008> solution       $("#sel_coupletable_insert").bind("click", coupletable_insert_click);
[04:45:55] <jop008>       $("#auto_sel_coupletable_insert").bind("click", coupletable_insert_click);
[04:55:44] <kukuv> why nobody talked here?
[04:57:00] <opstad> jop008: was that an answer to my question, or something else?
[05:16:38] <asmyt> hello, is there anything like .prependTo() for .before()?
[06:06:03] <msg> hey all
[06:06:27] <msg> i'm trying to do the following - hide all divs with $('div').transition({ opacity:0 })
[06:06:49] <msg> then bring three of them back up again with $('whatever').transition({ opacity:1 });
[06:07:03] <msg> and two others have different IDs
[06:07:36] <msg> anyway, because JS is asyncronous, the first line of code competes with the next three
[06:07:56] <msg> So basically things just stay at opacity 0
[06:08:15] <msg> Is there any way to make things happen one after another in JS?
[08:32:06] <mystronyx> I have an HTML table. I've been using jqueryUI like this: $('tbody').sortable(), which works fine. If I first include the table's ID like this: $('#table1 tbody').sortable(), the sort seems to be broken, and I receive no error. Any idea why?
[08:33:35] <mystronyx> Looks like I need the > inbetween, so it's $('#table1 > tbody')
[08:40:38] <ethan1341> i am ajaxing images on to the page but since they aren't in the actual code i am having trouble ajaxing them
[08:41:11] <ethan1341> *linking the ajaxed pictures
[08:41:13] <sacho_> mystronyx, the space means "'s descendants", so #table1 tbody would be #table1's descendants matching tbody
[08:41:21] <sacho_> mystronyx, > is direct children.
[08:41:38] <mystronyx> sacho_ oh ok, thanks
[08:41:54] <sacho_> I can't think of a reason why descendants would fail in your case.
[08:42:35] <ethan1341> http://jsfiddle.net/8bkv951q/1/ theres my code
[08:42:50] <mystronyx> sacho_ yeah I'm not sure either, but at least > worked
[08:50:50] <jop008> must I use a fixed name for the bind? //$("#insert_auto_insert_coupletable").bind("click", input_button_click);       $("#" + cbutton1 + cid).bind("click", input_button_click); is this the same given my varaibles are okay?
[08:55:40] <jop008> Can you $('#myTable').on('click', 'tr', function (event) { replace myTable with a string expression?
[08:55:55] <jop008> to bind the onclikc dynamicly
[09:06:13] <jop008> you can
[09:41:31] <Myrtti> *cough*
[09:41:37] <Myrtti> no, didn't trip the bot
[12:17:54] <yeukhon|afk> if foo() returns ajax promise, is it preferred to just use .done and .fail? does .fail also catch the none 2xx/3xx errors?
[12:18:42] <jonez> yeukhon, maybe easier said than done.. but could you try testing it?
[12:19:26] <yeukhon> jonez:  hmm sure. i guess i will try.
[12:21:02] <phoenixsun> I have a ajax call within a for loop. and to get straight to the point. Things in the loop are happening as I expected http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=mbs0Q0PdOG
[12:21:39] <phoenixsun> it seems to run through the loop instantaneously (in a way)
[12:22:09] <phoenixsun> aren't*
[12:25:54] <systemfault> phoenixsun: Yeah, async functions are like that... they're not blocking
[12:26:03] <systemfault> Is there an OP here?
[12:26:15] <vladikoff> systemfault, what's up
[12:26:32] <systemfault> vladikoff: You're an op? raaamina is flooding
[12:26:54] <systemfault> vladikoff: When you write something on the channel, you get a PM with some stupid link
[12:27:23] <systemfault> Hmm, what about casio? Was he doing the same?
[12:27:29] <systemfault> Ah... Same IP range
[12:27:52] <systemfault> Thank you vladikoff
[12:31:00] <systemfault> This is a t e s t
[12:32:00] <vladikoff> test
[12:32:42] <systemfault> Let's just hope that nobody legit has an IP address within the banned range :/
[12:32:47] <Tomashe> wierd on that line i got error $(".RM").append(data); , Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected reserved word
[12:33:27] <systemfault> Tomashe: I don't see any reserved identifier on that line, it could be a bit before
[12:33:43] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:34:22] <Tomashe> $.post(url,{category : "" , lang : "en" },function(data) {
[12:34:32] <phoenixsun> how does one add data from an ajax call and iteration in one loop?
[12:35:04] <Tomashe> thats the line before , i dont see any reserved word
[12:35:16] <systemfault> phoenixsun: You mean doing ajax calls serially or in parallel?
[12:35:25] <systemfault> Tomashe: Neither I :/
[12:35:43] <systemfault> Tomashe: What browser ?(Just curious)
[12:35:50] <Tomashe> chrome
[12:35:52] <Tomashe> i can show u the page
[12:35:58] <systemfault> Tomashe: Please.
[12:36:03] <systemfault> That would help immensely.
[12:36:50] <phoenixsun> systemfault: serially
[12:38:37] <systemfault> phoenixsun: Do you mind pasting your function on a pastebin so I can fix it for you?
[12:38:56] <phoenixsun> systemfault: ok will do
[12:40:59] <phoenixsun> systemfault: this is the function - http://pastebin.com/B2p99bwY
[12:41:49] <systemfault> I see, why does it need to be done serially?
[12:42:26] <Prometheian> I'm making a site and I want to have a news page. I can grab the data easy, but I was wondering if there's a js library to make rendering the news page really easy/sexy.
[12:43:00] <phoenixsun> systemfault: I am not sure what the best approach is. After looking into the resulting array I realised that only 'artist' is being written into the array
[12:43:49] <phoenixsun> and index is always its max
[12:45:34] <systemfault> Give me 2 minutes
[12:45:39] <phoenixsun> ok cool
[12:56:31] <systemfault> phoenixsun: I'd do something a bit like http://jsfiddle.net/j1wndt9w/
[12:59:10] <phoenixsun> systemfault: I am delving through you approach. Thanks for the code
[13:01:19] <bigLanky> hi everyone... i'm having some trouble getting my JS to initialize.. this is what I have now:

[13:14:06] <Tomashe> Hey guys , this should only get the non-selected checkbox right ? cuz its not :/ var data = $(this).parent().parent().find("input[type=checkbox]:not(:selected)").serialize();
[13:14:17] <phoenixsun> systemfault: After careful observation I have decided that  don't really understand your code. So I guess I have my work cut out for me lol
[13:18:48] <Tomashe> ?
[13:24:46] <Tomashe> it should be checked and not sleeced :)
[13:39:00] <Tomashe> why the hell this isnt working : $(this).parent().parent().find("input[type=checkbox]:not(:checked)").serialize();, and this is $(this).parent().parent().find("input[type=checkbox]:checked").serialize(); , im 100% positive there is UNCHECKED ones since i click on them!
[13:59:31] <sacho> ew.
[14:21:21] <spike_headon> anyone talking..need a bit of help
[14:35:59] <Tomashe> why the hell this isnt working : $(this).parent().parent().find("input[type=checkbox]:not(:checked)").serialize();, and this is $(this).parent().parent().find("input[type=checkbox]:checked").serialize(); , im 100% positive there is UNCHECKED ones since i click on them!
[14:38:38] <sacho> Tomashe, post an example with your problem on jsfiddle.
[14:40:45] <Tomashe> ok
[14:45:33] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/zvmgcf9u/
[14:45:36] <Tomashe> tghere is is :/
[14:45:49] <Tomashe> if u remove the :not(:checked) u will see the output
[14:46:05] <Tomashe> sorry wait
[14:46:21] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/zvmgcf9u/1/
[14:46:22] <Tomashe> there u go
[14:51:35] <Tomashe> sacho: so what u think
[14:51:40] <Tomashe> or maybe someone else
[14:58:30] <mystronyx> I have a sidebar than I want to scroll when hovering over it. When hovering over the rest of the page, I want to scroll the page. Would I use jquery to make this distinction?
[15:04:56] <Tomashe> http://jsfiddle.net/zvmgcf9u/1/ why its not output anything
[15:08:09] <sacho> Tomashe, doh, I should have figured this out earlier
[15:08:21] <sacho> Tomashe, .serialize() on unchecked checkboxes will always produce ""
[15:08:37] <sacho> unchecked checkboxes serialize to nothing
[15:13:16] <greatwhitehat> o7
[15:13:17] <Tomashe> hmm
[15:13:27] <Tomashe> so what i need to do to get value of unchecked?
[15:14:30] <greatwhitehat> Been trying to find a url to "ui-anim_basic_16x16.gif" for the Vader theme using CDN. Any help?
[15:14:54] <Tomashe> maybe be a way to serialized unchecked
[15:14:59] <Tomashe> right?
[15:15:35] <sacho> well annoying you wouldn't be able to use serialize()
[15:17:37] <Tomashe> , there is something else that can do the same and get me unchecked in a serialized way?
[15:18:24] <sacho> you'd basically have to do it manually
[15:18:33] <Tomashe> dan
[15:18:35] <Tomashe> damn
[15:18:36] <Tomashe> but ok
[15:18:46] <amh345> I'm messing around around with json and adding products (shopping cart) to an empty object. is empty_object += jQuery.parseJSON(..some json..) the wrong way to go about it?
[15:19:12] <sacho> Tomashe, something like this
[15:19:17] <amh345> when i inspect the results of the object via for loop it shows OBJECT OBJECT with a single letter per line.
[15:19:43] <amh345> but when i do empty_object = Jquery.parseJSON(..) it looks ok.
[15:21:33] <sacho> Tomashe, http://jsfiddle.net/zvmgcf9u/4/
[15:27:34] <Tomashe> yes actualy i already fixed it :)
[15:27:43] <Tomashe> if u need me ever im here!
[16:07:25] <WrekitRalfie> Hey all
[16:07:39] <WrekitRalfie> Anyone free to help with a jQuery chosen issue?
[16:07:46] <clarkk> issues/31#issuecomment-11851390
[16:07:47] <WrekitRalfie> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25476949/how-to-update-jquery-chosen-options-on-keyboard-input-with-ajax
[16:08:11] <clarkk> sorry, my url got truncated. I meant this bit of code  https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/issues/31#issuecomment-11851390
[16:08:50] <clarkk> how does the if statement in the handler have any bearing on the options object that is passed as a secondary argument?
[16:11:24] <WrekitRalfie> Anyone able to help?
[16:21:18] <WrekitRalfie> Does anyone talk here? xD
[16:22:04] <clarkk> it's sunday night/monday morning. If anyone has a job, they are probably in bed by now :p
[16:22:15] <WrekitRalfie> It's bank holiday tomorrow
[16:22:20] <clarkk> heeh
[16:22:20] <WrekitRalfie> Day off for me ;)
[16:22:35] <clarkk> and you are working now? :p
[16:23:05] <WrekitRalfie> Personal work :)
[16:23:22] <clarkk> I had a look at your problem, but I've not used chosen, I'm afraid
[16:24:00] <WrekitRalfie> It's weird
[16:27:09] <clarkk> WrekitRalfie: in your question, it would help if you included a link to the lib you are using, preferably where you mention it in the first sentence
[16:28:28] <clarkk> the chosen demo doesn't even seem to work for me
[16:29:06] <clarkk> oh I see what it does
[16:29:20] <clarkk> nice!
[16:34:26] <clarkk> WrekitRalfie: can you try $('.SelectMembers').trigger('chosen:updated'); , without the append?
[16:35:06] <clarkk> WrekitRalfie: also, it would be good to include your html in the question
[16:44:05] <clarkk> WrekitRalfie: so, any chance you could look at my problem?
[16:44:12] <clarkk> *question
[16:45:13] <WrekitRalfie> Oh sorry man didn't see
[16:46:07] <WrekitRalfie> Without the append the SelectMembers wouldn't have the new values
[16:46:49] <clarkk> I see. It was just a suggestion. I'm sorry I can't help more with that
[16:46:57] <WrekitRalfie> Not a problem :)
[16:47:39] <clarkk> my question is about a plugin. Just looking at the code snippet I think is enough to understand what I am asking...
[16:47:42] <clarkk> https://github.com/imakewebthings/jquery-waypoints/issues/31#issuecomment-11851390
[16:48:18] <clarkk> how could the options object passed as the second arg be affected by the if statement in the handler passed as the first arg?
[16:48:37] <clarkk> it just doesn't seem possible, regardless of the lib used
[16:50:24] <WrekitRalfie> 2 secs just checking it
[16:50:31] <clarkk> thanks
[16:51:01] <amh345> I'm having a bunch of struggles trying to get items added to a json object only if they are not already present.  i just can't get it working.  i've setup a functional (well, sort of functional) jsfiddle here. http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/
[16:51:27] <amh345> it's doing a lot of weird things.  first it's adding them regardless. and then it's also adding the previous one that was clicked, i think.
[16:51:51] <WrekitRalfie> Sorry @clarkk I'm knackered so I'm crap
[16:51:53] <amh345> idea is that it adds to the object if not present. if it is present it should update the quantity +!
[16:52:00] <amh345> err +1
[16:52:01] <WrekitRalfie> I've bookmarked it and I'll look later :)
[16:55:34] <clarkk> amh345: where do you add data to the productsion_in_cart array?
[16:55:59] <clarkk> oh right, I see
[16:56:07] <amh345>     products_in_cart.push(jQuery.parseJSON('{"productid":"'+productid+'","productname":"'+productname+'","quantity" : 1}'));
[16:58:44] <amh345> clarkk: does the code make any sense?
[16:59:02] <clarkk> amh345: you should always resolve the issues highlighted by jshint before sharing. Also, use the tidyup function
[16:59:07] <amh345> I've been docking with it for the last few hours.  a lot of it is new to me. especially this json stuff.
[16:59:39] <amh345> oh wow. i just sae jshint now.  i didn't even know that was a thing.
[16:59:53] <clarkk> heh, ok, no worries :)
[17:00:09] <clarkk> jsfiddle is being really slow for me
[17:00:28] <amh345> ok. updated using hint and format. http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/2/
[17:01:20] <amh345> the end game here is a store all this in the $.cookie plugin so the data can be carried around the site.  but i THINK that will be the easy part.
[17:08:22] <clarkk> amh345: ugh, firefox was slow so I'm using chrome. Do you know how to disable the way it hides duplicate log messages?
[17:08:57] <clarkk> amh345: it's difficult to see what's going on with your code when it's filtering them :/
[17:09:43] <amh345> i wish i knew clarkk.  but i know that the duplicates (as in (2) (3) etc) shouldn't even be there because there isn't suppose to be a duplicate :)
[17:10:10] <clarkk> I just mean the function in chrome. I want to disable it
[17:11:59] <clarkk> ffs, this is fucking ridiculous!
[17:12:14] <amh345> I'm not sure how to do it. sorry man
[17:18:23] <clarkk> amh345: lines 11 to 13 seem superfluous
[17:20:40] <clarkk> amh345: also, just use javascript to check for an empty array
[17:24:16] <amh345> are those lines what's causing the problem?
[17:24:32] <clarkk> not sure yet. Just cleaning up the code, then I can look at the problem
[17:25:30] <amh345> i think i see what you mean with 11-13
[17:41:20] <clarkk> amh345: you still there?
[17:43:33] <yeukhon> http://dpaste.com/2CAHT3Q  why is j undefined?
[17:44:11] <yeukhon> i know resp.responseJSON exist.
[17:45:45] <clarkk> amh345: I hope you haven't gone after I've done this! :p  http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/5/
[17:49:31] <yeukhon> ah resp is already the JSON
[17:49:41] <amh345> hi clarkk. i didn't go anywhere.  just grabbed a drink. checing it out now.
[17:50:27] <amh345> oh wow clarkk .  you even got the quantities!
[17:50:34] <clarkk> :)
[17:51:18] <amh345> this is great!  and so much more concise! thank you very much!
[17:51:57] <clarkk> you're very welcome amh345. Actually, I'd create the event like this http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/6/ (see line 3)
[17:53:09] <amh345> this is great.   and it's done in such a way that it looks like i can easily add some function for removing and whatnot.
[17:53:20] <amh345> thank you so much. much apprecaited.
[17:53:45] <clarkk> it was a fun exercise. Cheers amh345 :)
[17:54:05] <amh345> :)
[17:54:17] <clarkk> amh345: a couple of points to consider..
[17:54:23] <amh345> one quick question. this will still function as a json object, yes?
[17:54:36] <amh345> i will be dumping the value of cart to a cookie
[17:55:13] <clarkk> amh345: when naming object properties, remember that the object name should describe the object, so there is no need to duplicate this in the property names
[17:55:49] <clarkk> amh345: the loop on line 12 is for iterating an array. You were iterating an object even though cart is an array
[17:56:47] <clarkk> amh345: the for array (in the form it is on line 12) creates the length variable with each iteration, unless you define it first, in the first arg, as i have
[17:56:55] <clarkk> (not in the second arg)
[17:58:15] <amh345> i see what you're saying. I'm going to go through your code to understand all your notes.
[18:07:36] <clarkk> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/7/
[18:09:27] <clarkk> amh345: or you can use a tab to prettyfy the output http://jsfiddle.net/170bxyLz/8/  See MDN for info http://goo.gl/vldff
[18:11:43] <clarkk> amh345: also see caniuse.com for which browsers support JSON.stringify. You would probably be better off using jquery's implementation http://caniuse.com/#feat=json
[18:12:41] <amh345> well you've basically solved all the problems i was having!
[18:13:30] <clarkk> well, don't worry - keep on at it, and you will build on your skills

[21:55:40] <tomatto> hi
[23:40:16] <yeukhon> is it silly to create a defer and return a promise for $("#editor") which will return the content of the textarea/editor
[23:41:47] <systemfault> Why would you make something that is sync... async? (Perhaps you have a reason)
[23:42:15] <yeukhon> right is $("#editor") always sync?
[23:42:20] <systemfault> Yup
[23:42:29] <systemfault> And accessing a property of it too
[23:43:57] <yeukhon> okay :) i think one point i read a code like that. perphas i misinterpret the intention or there is some asyncness behind the scene
[23:43:59] <yeukhon> thanks
