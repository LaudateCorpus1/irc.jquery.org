[00:07:30] <tuskkk___> How to change the link using jquery? Say I have a link, /notebook/listFolders/folderName/test26, how how to remove that test26 and add a new name?
[00:11:43] <dw1> tuskkk___: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/179713/how-to-change-the-href-for-a-hyperlink-using-jquery ?
[00:12:18] <dw1> so I have some rows with onclick on the <tr>. In the last cell I want to have links to other things and prevent the <tr> onclick from affecting it
[00:12:55] <dw1> $('.exlink').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); } ); didn't help :(
[00:14:07] <dw1> and the z-index is high
[00:14:58] <JosefDe> Hey guys. How can I send HTML as JSON? Sometimes it works but I often get this error message: Error when attempting to parse xhr response text (SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected ',' or '}' after property value in object at line 1 column 48 of the JSON data)"
[00:15:14] <dw1> oh damn http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/Scripting/JavaScript/Q_21386740.html
[00:15:25] <Cork> JosefDe: you have to string escape the html
[00:15:47] <Cork> meaning <elm attr=""> => <elm attr=\"\">
[00:15:58] <JosefDe> I only use json_encode() of php. What do I have to do else?
[00:16:39] <Cork> json_encode should already do this
[00:16:50] <JosefDe> but it looks like it doesn't do it
[00:16:54] <Cork> JosefDe: run the resulting json through jsonlint.com
[00:16:57] <JosefDe> I'm using it
[00:17:03] <Cork> and see what exactly is going wrong
[00:17:57] <JosefDe> yeah it says error
[00:18:51] <JosefDe> Next problem is. How do I fix it? It is normal html output
[00:19:12] <Cork> JosefDe: you need to share what the problem is
[00:19:24] <Cork> just that "something has an error" is way to vague
[00:19:32] <JosefDe> It has some newlines \\n
[00:19:53] <Cork> \n should be just fine
[00:20:01] <JosefDe> The problem is: I'm doing a ajax-request and my server does json_encode("My-HTML-Content") and returns it
[00:20:07] <Cork> so that isn't the problem
[00:20:09] <JosefDe> it json_encode()'s standard html
[00:20:18] <JosefDe> Then why does it fail?
[00:20:23] <JosefDe> I'm doing json_encode
[00:20:40] <Cork> i can't say as i don't know what is failing
[00:20:45] <Cork> i can't mind read...
[00:21:05] <JosefDe> I told you what is failing: jquery says that it is invalid JSON-data
[00:21:19] <JosefDe> Parse error on line 3:
[00:21:19] <JosefDe> ...\"\\n\\n\\n<div id="\\\"anlageantrag01co
[00:21:19] <JosefDe> -----------------------^
[00:21:19] <JosefDe> Expecting '}', ':', ',', ']'
[00:21:50] <Cork> JosefDe: you need to give json_encode an array
[00:22:02] <Cork> not just a straight string
[00:23:12] <Cork> JosefDe: ex. json_encode(array("html" => $html_string))
[00:24:06] <Cork> or at least, that is my guess, hard to day without knowing what goes wrong
[00:24:11] <Cork> as you refuse to share that
[00:25:52] <JosefDe> oh. So this will fix it? Putting my content inside an array?
[00:26:06] <Cork> like i said, i'm guessing
[00:26:12] <Cork> can't say without knowing what goes wrong
[00:35:04] <Duvdevan> hi
[00:35:18] <Duvdevan> when will Yii version 2.0.5 be out?
[00:35:34] <Duvdevan> and Yii version 1.1.17?
[00:37:13] <Xatenev> Duvdevan: are u serious?
[00:37:31] <Duvdevan> sorry
[00:37:33] <Duvdevan> wrong channel
[01:21:27] <dw1> noob question.. when you do $(".item").click(function(data) { ... what's the best way to use/act-as the element clicked on?
[01:21:46] <Cork> $(this)
[01:22:01] <Cork> also the argument isn't data its event
[01:22:14] <dw1> awesome thx
[02:10:19] <kokut> i'm getting "functionName is not defined" and i'm seeing it right there, da fuq?
[02:11:02] <Kartagis> testcase?
[02:11:28] <Kartagis> heh. kokut make a testcase on jsfiddle.net
[02:12:43] <kokut> cant its too specific
[02:13:47] <kokut> nvm fixed it
[02:23:38] <FilipNortic> does the when() method fail if the browser doesn't support promises?
[02:23:45] <Cork> no
[02:23:56] <Cork> $.when doesn't use promises at all
[02:23:59] <kokut> $.fn.jQuery is throwing undefined :\
[02:24:01] <Cork> it uses $.deferred
[02:24:31] <Cork> kokut: small q
[02:24:38] <Cork> $.fn.jquery not jQuery
[02:24:47] <kokut> oh lol
[02:26:05] <kokut> ty Cork
[02:26:23] <FilipNortic> and promise is a subset of defered or am i still lost?
[02:27:02] <Cork> FilipNortic: Promise as in the es6 definition is modeled after (among other) $.deferred
[02:27:10] <Cork> they aren't related
[02:27:42] <Cork> $.Deferred doesn't use Promise even if it is implemented by the browser
[02:27:55] <Cork> (at least not yet)
[02:29:08] <Cork> FilipNortic: jquery exposes deferred as a "promise()" method if that is the one you're talking about
[02:29:19] <Cork> but again it isn't related to Promise
[02:31:37] <FilipNortic> I was trying to figure out witch  jQuery methods may cause trubble in a browser without promise support
[02:31:54] <Cork> FilipNortic: none of the core ones
[02:32:08] <Cork> a plugin might, if it doesn't use deferred
[02:32:55] <norc> Hi. Assume I bind to the input event of an input field, and make an Ajax request. Is there a good way to abort any requests that may already be under the way?
[02:33:21] <Cork> norc: sure, save the xhr object you get from ajax
[02:33:27] <Cork> and call xhr.abort()
[02:33:39] <norc> Cork: Oh thats sweet.
[02:33:47] <Cork> norc: though you might want to implement that as a setTimeout instead
[02:34:04] <norc> I guess this would be a really good use case for $.data?
[02:34:08] <Cork> (only fire the ajax after x ms of key inactivity)
[02:34:24] <norc> Oh, I actually want the search to trigger as fast as possible.
[02:34:26] <Cork> norc: depends on how many input fields use the ajax call
[02:34:41] <Cork> norc: ya, but a 200-300 ms delay isn't noricable
[02:34:55] <Cork> it just means it doesn't fire a search for each letter
[02:35:27] <norc> You are making a valid point there.
[02:35:46] <Cork> it's a very common autocomplete pattern :)
[02:35:52] <norc> Im guessing I should somehow remove the XHR object in the done callback?
[02:36:15] <Cork> there is two ways of doing this:
[02:36:44] <Cork> 1. when the event fires you start a timeout it will fire say 150ms after the first key is pressed; unless another key is pressed
[02:37:00] <Cork> 1a. if another key is pressed, it clears the old timeout and starts a new one
[02:37:25] <Cork> 1b. when the timeout fires an ajax call is made (no need to cancel the old one if you time this correctly
[02:37:42] <Cork> 2. each keydown fires an ajax call
[02:38:01] <Cork> 2a. if another key is pressed it calls xhr.abort() on the old object before making a new call
[02:38:10] <User458764> Hi, how do I get the html of the first option in a select?
[02:38:16] <Cork> 2 is the downside of causing quite a bit of load on the server
[02:38:24] <Cork> 1 should be good for most cases
[02:38:55] <Cork> User458764: $('select option').first().html()=
[02:39:01] <Cork> User458764: * $('select option').first().html()
[02:39:50] <JosefDe> Guys. I'm really irritated. I'm sending html as json by using json_encode() in php, most of the time I don't get any error but sometimes jquery says, that the json is invalid. Some guys suggested a solution with putting it into an array. Would that be a  solution?
[02:40:07] <JosefDe> The problem is, that I can't test if it solved the problem, as it only occurs sometimes
[02:40:26] <Cork> JosefDe: again, you need to share the problem so ppl can look at it
[02:40:44] <Cork> a "something fails what is wrong" is just asking ppl to make wild guesses
[02:40:44] <JosefDe> My problem is this:
[02:41:00] <Cork> JosefDe: no, not a description
[02:41:09] <Cork> copy the response that cause the error
[02:41:31] <Cork> and replace possible sensitive data with placeholder text
[02:41:38] <Cork> but leave the structure as is
[02:41:43] <Cork> and make a pb of that
[02:42:02] <User458764> Cork It gives only the text, for example my first option is <option value="0">Select</option> and your query returns me only Select
[02:42:13] <norc> Cork: Alright you make a good point there. I guess I will actually implement both
[02:42:23] <Cork> User458764: why do you want the html of the option?
[02:42:27] <JosefDe> ok
[02:42:29] <JosefDe> wait a second
[02:42:31] <norc> as I have some searches that can take up to several seconds to compute, it would be nice for a user to not be forced to wait if he makes a mistake.
[02:42:40] <norc> Cork: Thank you for your helpful input.
[02:43:27] <User458764> Cork I need it :) but if there is no way to get I can write as it <option value="0">Select</option>
[02:43:43] <JosefDe> This is the output http://pastebin.com/crY2KNbf
[02:43:51] <Cork> User458764: well sure, you can get it, but most likely what you want is just .clone()
[02:43:57] <Cork> and that is why i asked
[02:44:08] <thebatu1> hello can I ask a css selector question here ? rooms sass or css are not active?
[02:44:39] <Cork> thebatu1: give it a try, might direct you to css if it is too specific css though
[02:44:47] <Cork> actually, give me a min
[02:46:35] <Cork> thebatu1: there answered in #css
[02:46:50] <thebatu1> hello, I am having difficulty with css selectors. I want to replace a hard coded asterisk * with css:after pseudo element. can you show me how to please  https://gist.github.com/thebatu/7dc2c3f5b6a95c9d3887
[02:47:12] <Cork> JosefDe: you double encode the content
[02:47:26] <Cork> JosefDe: so the escape gets escaped and that causes things to break
[02:47:40] <Cork> JosefDe: this is a question for ##php though not #jquery
[02:48:00] <Cork> as it has nothing to do with receiving side
[02:53:14] <hollusion> $('div').dialog({options1}).dialog({options2}) seems to initiate two dialogs.
[02:53:57] <hollusion> but wouldn't it me more intuitive to apply options2 on the first dialog instead of creating a second one?
[02:54:10] <hollusion> *it be more
[02:54:38] <Cork> hollusion: $('div').dialog({options1}).dialog('option', {options2})
[02:54:42] <hollusion> $('div').dialog({options1}).dialog({options2}) != $('div').dialog({options1}).dialog('option', {options2})
[02:54:44] <hollusion> yes indeed
[02:55:00] <hollusion> but when does one need the first behavior?
[02:55:02] <Cork> it's the way widgetframeworks is designed
[02:55:26] <Cork> cause the first call initiates the instance, the second calls the option method on the instance
[02:57:26] <hollusion> totally fine with me but i don't see any conte circumstance where $('div').dialog({options1}).dialog({options2}) is of any use
[02:57:49] <hollusion> except for applying new options to the first dialog
[02:58:02] <hollusion> -conte
[02:58:07] <Cork> hollusion: sure, but it does for other widgets
[02:58:24] <Cork> so the special case would men it couldn't build ontop of widgetfactory
[02:59:26] <hollusion> so it is a "definition thing"
[02:59:51] <hollusion> couldn't find a better word. well, thank you for explaining
[03:00:45] <hollusion> ui-widget design standard
[03:01:41] <Schabo> Using jQuery-mobile and can't get button icons to show, can't find what I'm doing wrong here but the "ui-icon-clock" class is removed and only the text is showing: "<div><button class='ui-btn ui-icon-clock'>Clock</button></div>"
[03:04:40] <hollusion> make a jsfiddle or else ppl wont be able to help
[03:04:57] <Schabo> Right.. Will do
[03:24:00] <DarsVaeda> I connect a draggable to a sortable, can I know when the draggable was dragged into the sortable?
[03:24:14] <DarsVaeda> or rather dropped into
[03:24:45] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-over
[03:24:59] <Schabo> So I can't get the same issue on jsfiddle, if anyone want's to help I can send a link to the page where I have the issue
[03:25:24] <DarsVaeda> Cork, thanks will look into that
[03:26:14] <DarsVaeda> oh right below is receive, that sounds like what I need, I only read the draggable docs *shame on me*
[03:26:31] <hollusion> Schabo: send it to me ill take a look
[03:26:45] <JosefDe> I really have no idea how to fix this?
[03:27:02] <Schabo> Thank you :)
[03:58:50] <kokut> Cork: do you know how to calculate the distance to the right or left of the screen of an element?
[03:59:25] <Cork> screen no
[03:59:39] <Cork> if you meant the viewport "browser window" then ya
[04:00:28] <kokut> Cork: yea man
[04:01:42] <kokut> Cork: how?
[04:03:39] <kokut> Cork: u there man?
[04:04:04] <crillegustafsson> Hi, How to get my save button and reset button to work ? ---> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/a1s92dzx/1/
[04:04:25] <Cork> kokut: .offset()
[04:04:40] <kokut> Cork: k lemme try it
[04:06:20] <crillegustafsson> the draw works ---> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/a1s92dzx/2/
[04:06:41] <crillegustafsson> but I want to save the image to a image file
[04:06:50] <crillegustafsson> when clicking save image =)
[04:08:37] <Cork> crillegustafsson: you mean the post part?
[04:08:38] <crillegustafsson> is there anyone who could help me out =) ?
[04:08:43] <Cork> or the window.location part?
[04:08:54] <Cork> cause the later should work, the former won't
[04:09:13] <crillegustafsson> Cork when I click save.. I wanna save image to my server auto
[04:09:41] <Cork> crillegustafsson: you have to generate a blob, and give that to FromData
[04:09:45] <crillegustafsson> so I can see this image/picture in my server folder
[04:09:52] <Cork> adn then use form data instead of the object
[04:10:12] <Cork> you can't create an url and send that to the server
[04:10:23] <Cork> cause the url is a memory reference so the server won't have access
[04:10:47] <crillegustafsson> Cork okey, I see, u know a good guide for that ? =)
[04:10:57] <Cork> ?mdn formdata
[04:10:58] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[04:12:39] <crillegustafsson> Cork : like this --> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16148371/send-canvas-image-and-form-data-to-server-to-name-png
[04:20:36] <kokut> Cork: do u know how to link to a section inside another html document? like #carrots section or whatever? like wikipedia
[04:23:02] <kokut> Cork: btw the offset function worked perfectly, at least in chrome :)
[04:23:14] <Cork> kokut: as long as the element have an id
[04:23:19] <Cork> it should work out of the box
[04:23:20] <kokut> Cork: yea
[04:23:28] <kokut> like what?
[04:23:34] <kokut> site.com/#carrots ?
[04:23:35] <Cork> hash linking
[04:23:37] <Cork> yes
[04:23:42] <kokut> oh neat
[04:23:43] <AdamPDotty> mysite.html#carrots
[04:23:58] <kokut> isnt /#carrots ?
[04:24:14] <AdamPDotty> could work, too
[04:24:24] <Cork> kokut: the url doens't really matter
[04:24:31] <AdamPDotty> when the element is in index.htm or something
[04:24:35] <Cork> it's the hash that is important
[04:24:52] <Cork> the url loads the page and the hash tells the browser to scroll to that element
[04:26:19] <kokut> it works ! ty
[04:38:03] <Industrial> Hi. I have an element "<textarea id="title" class="title" placeholder="Mijn subdoel is" maxlength="40" data-required="true" autofocus=""></textarea>"
[04:38:06] <Industrial> $('#title') returns one jquery result. both $('#title').focus(); and $('#title')[0].focus(); have no effect on the input. it doesn't get focused. Any idea why?
[04:38:35] <Cork> Industrial: ids are unique identifiers of a single element
[04:38:40] <Cork> it can't ever exist on more then one element
[04:38:52] <Cork> Industrial: if you want to indicate multiple elements, use a class
[04:38:56] <Industrial> I understand this, and so my query returns one result
[04:39:00] <Industrial> this is what i want
[04:39:07] <Industrial> what it doesn't do is get focused.
[04:39:24] <Cork> $('#title').length == 1?
[04:39:28] <Cork> opps
[04:39:28] <Industrial> yes
[04:39:43] <Cork> sorry $('[id="title"]').length == 1
[04:41:37] <Industrial> hm it seems to be a backbone view rendering issue
[04:41:50] <Industrial> the dom element isn't available yet when I'm depending on it
[04:43:38] <Cork> ya, i suspected that
[04:43:43] <Cork> or duplicate ids
[04:45:41] <randomguy1> is there a way to see a list of functions that are bound to an event?
[04:45:50] <Industrial> https://gist.github.com/Industrial/2268bba6781d2e901408
[04:45:56] <Cork> randomguy1: not officially no
[04:45:57] <Industrial> you'd say it would be available
[04:46:10] <Industrial> Maybe this.$el isn't injected anywhere yet
[04:46:12] <randomguy1> dang
[04:46:42] <Industrial> and focusing only works on dom elements aith an eventual window parent?
[04:47:06] <Cork> randomguy1: there is some hacks you can use to see the events jquery know about
[04:47:17] <Cork> randomguy1: but it is an internal and _not supported_ api
[04:47:33] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[04:47:47] <Cork> but like i said, don't depend on that one for released code ^
[04:47:53] <randomguy1> at this point i'll take whatever, ;)  this defect is kickin my ...
[04:48:02] <Duvdevan> window = null; //bye bye
[04:48:05] <Cork> randomguy1: so; what is it you are trying to do?
[04:48:17] <toomus> Hi. I have two elements: <i class="remove"> and <i class="remove close">. When I try this $(document).on('click', 'i.remove', function () {}); each icon fires this. How to prevent this behavior?
[04:48:21] <Cork> there might be better options
[04:48:43] <Duvdevan> toomus you might have to check
[04:48:43] <Cork> toomus: what do you want to fire it?
[04:48:51] <Duvdevan> which element/s thou want to fire
[04:48:54] <randomguy1> i got a textarea that on enter is submitting the page, which it should.  problem is, it is not setting a needed hidden variable before it does the submit
[04:48:58] <randomguy1> *however*
[04:49:05] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'i.remove:not(.close)', function () {}) ?
[04:49:07] <randomguy1> i go back one git commit and it works fine
[04:49:23] <randomguy1> the git commit that it fails on is a merge that lists no changes, :(
[04:49:35] <Cork> ah, so for debugging
[04:49:39] <randomguy1> yep
[04:49:45] <Cork> then ya, $._data is ok to use for debugging
[04:50:51] <toomus> Cork: How to bind this click, to icon with only 'remove' class?
[04:51:04] <Cork> toomus: i just gave you the answer
[04:51:24] <randomguy1> ele a selector or object?  or either?
[04:51:25] <Cork> toomus: though note it will not be .remove only
[04:51:32] <randomguy1> ^elm
[04:51:38] <Cork> it will explicitly exclude .close
[04:51:43] <toomus> Cork:thx, but this only filter 'close' class, What if there will be 10 multiple classes?
[04:51:50] <Cork> toomus: if you want to make .remove specific, add another class to it
[04:52:03] <Cork> toomus: exactly, so add a specific class to it
[04:52:19] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'i.remove.my-class', function () {}) ?
[04:52:42] <toomus> Cork: OK
[04:54:32] <randomguy1> ah, elm is the raw dom object
[04:55:15] <Cork> its the raw dom ELEMENT ya :)
[04:57:05] <randomguy1> nyce, thank you very much.
[05:03:45] <randomguy1> is it a correct assumption that the array order is the order in which the event will execute, provided it's not cancelled?
[05:04:19] <Cork> randomguy1: yes, though don't forget delegated event handlers
[05:04:55] <randomguy1> k

[05:31:48] <cannap> i cant see a preloader or something

[05:38:36] <logikos> i am using using $.ajax(..) to get a javascript object from the server, however sometimes the object contains a property with a function as a value, so this is  not valid JSON, if i set content type to application/json then $.ajax().fail() will trigger because its not valid json .. what is the best way to pass this object from the server to the client without an error?
[05:39:12] <logikos> obviously if its not valid json it is just javascript ... but do i have to put window.somevar = {}; in the javascript just so i can access the object inside $.ajax() ?
[05:39:49] <logikos> not sure if i'm asking the question right but i hope you know what i'm trying to do
[05:40:17] <Duvdevan> window = null; // solves everything
[05:40:58] <logikos> of course, why didnt i think of that...
[05:41:08] <logikos> anyways...
[05:41:43] <Cork> logikos: the best option is to avoid sending the function
[05:41:59] <Cork> define them in the page and just indicate that it should be called instead
[05:45:52] <logikos> this is a unique situation where the 'page' is a web based application used internally, most ppl just leave it up and everything they do inside the 'page' is an ajax request, so apart from the initial page load (which doesnt happen very often) everything else is just loaded via ajax
[05:46:33] <logikos> also this specific ajax request is getting a dynamic JavaScript object created in php
[05:47:31] <logikos> i can set content type to application/javascript and just have it include the seeting of a var that I can then access but it just seems a little hacky
[05:50:37] <Cork> logikos: then the better option might be to just send javascript instead of json
[05:50:50] <Cork> then you get valid behavior
[05:51:27] <logikos> right, i want to send a javascript object (although not valid JSON ) and use it client side
[05:51:57] <logikos> so if i set content type to application/javascript and send window.ajaxresult={some object here that is not valid json but is valid javascript};
[05:52:03] <logikos> then access window.ajaxresult
[05:52:07] <logikos> but it seems hacky
[05:52:14] <Cork> logikos: you could do something similar to jsonp
[05:52:15] <logikos> didnt know if there was a better way or not
[05:52:35] <Cork> where the server calls a function the client defines
[05:52:48] <Cork> and then you are just sending arguments
[05:52:54] <Cork> and you can do what ever you like there
[05:53:31] <Cork> function_that_is_globally_unique_for_this_call(object_generated_by_php);
[05:53:49] <logikos> i dont understand and have never used jsonp, but if it is a good fit for this I suppose I should invest time into reading up on it
[05:53:53] <Cork> and the ajax call removes the function after the call succeeds
[05:54:13] <Cork> logikos: you can't exactly do jsonp, but you could use it as a starting ground
[05:54:36] <Cork> logikos: the reason i mention it is, cause it is better to just send javascript then trying to break json
[05:54:46] <Cork> cause the later will violate the content-type
[05:54:56] <Cork> while you are perfectly capable to send data in javascript
[05:55:11] <Cork> (i wouldn't recommend it, but it is possible)
[06:05:00] <Tennis> hey can i get the contents of a div and store it as a sting then put back as html later
[06:05:22] <Tennis> im failling over at the first hurdle with my jquery selecter.html returning "function(e)"
[06:05:33] <Tennis> $("#special-dropdown-result").html
[06:05:50] <Tennis> is it because i have divs inside the div  ? is there a limit to how much html it can pick or something?
[06:11:24] <Tennis> forgot the brackets
[06:11:26] <effortDee> i have window.onLoad being used
[06:11:26] <Tennis> .html()
[06:11:40] <effortDee> i need to do it when a form is used (select dropdown) instead of the Window.onLoad
[06:11:48] <effortDee> any ideas?
[06:16:04] <notchris> Good morning everyone

[06:21:41] <crillegustafsson> how to make it to save to my servers image folder instead of downloading it?
[06:36:02] <Tennis> $("#special-dropdown-result").html(resetDiv);
[06:36:11] <Tennis> does anyone have any idea why this is changing the page?
[06:37:13] <Tennis> should i be using .append()
[06:40:33] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/ymjvkj1L/ dragging elements from right to the left sortable, those elements loose sortability (is this a word?), why?
[06:41:19] <DarsVaeda> the reason is somewhere related to the "receive" event function
[06:41:26] <DarsVaeda> if I remove that, it works
[06:42:16] <samssh> Tennis, $(el).html(newContent); will replace the entire contents of el with newContent. If you want to add content to the end, then use .append();
[06:42:42] <Tennis> yeah i do want to replace the contents entirely
[06:43:01] <Tennis> but for some weird reason
[06:43:08] <Tennis> its like refreshing the page
[06:43:18] <Tennis> or redirecting to the same page with just one bit of text
[06:43:54] <samssh> Tennis, You will probably need to link to the page or create a testcase.
[06:44:42] <Tennis> I don't want it to change page though
[06:44:50] <Tennis> just want it to change the contents of the div on the button click
[06:45:11] <Tennis> its like a reset button that brings it back to the prepoulated state we had on page load
[06:45:34] <samssh> Tennis, I mean put a link in the IRC to the page or a testcase for so I or someone else can see the problem better.
[06:45:52] <Tennis> oh yeah i might have to make a testcase
[06:46:03] <Tennis> its a bespoke ict system that runs on the intranet
[06:46:46] <samssh> Tennis, I like testcases better anyway. I always hesitant to follow random links, especially while I'm at work.
[06:50:37] <FilipNortic> what happend if you try and set a scripttags in html()/append() methods do they get executed?
[06:51:24] <Tennis> thatsa good question
[06:51:29] <Tennis> and probably part of my issue here
[06:52:14] <FilipNortic> yeah that's the only way i could see it happening but i never tried
[06:53:41] <Tennis> im reading something that says it doesnt execute it
[06:53:45] <Tennis> just parses it
[06:54:02] <Tennis> but ill test it because its just a random on stackoverflow
[06:54:10] <FilipNortic> yeah, seems like something you wouldn't want too do so I don't now why it would execute...

[07:06:01] <Kitsune> I'v made a bunch of animated emotes and I want to write something with jQ that will place the emote divs inside my text. Say I add a smiley in plain text: 'this is a ;) smiley' I want to replace ';)' with <span class="smile"></span> any thoughts on how to do this best, there's also a chance there's more than one inside the <p> that holds the text it should add the emotes into.
[07:08:39] <juro> Kitsune, I guess regex would be the best approach for that. Do you want to detect those as you write or afterwards?
[07:08:53] <Kitsune> Doesnt have to work the ;) / :) etc.. could also be something else if that makes it easier to write a function that can do this. like [wink]
[07:09:11] <Kitsune> afterwards for now
[07:09:39] <Kitsune> there's about 32 possible ones though.
[07:10:27] <Kitsune> you know, perhaps i should write something for the editor instead
[07:10:43] <Kitsune> so i know how to do that. Thanks :]
[07:11:04] <Kitsune> I just had to think out loud it seems to hear this wasn't the best approach to get what I want
[07:13:12] <BillCriswell> Kitsune: Works out that way often.
[07:20:44] <MetalHead77> How do I prevent horizontal scrolling in my jquerymobile app?
[07:21:28] <crillegustafsson> how to save to folder instead of download --> ?
[07:21:29] <crillegustafsson> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/a1s92dzx/3/
[07:21:56] <jacobroufa> @MetalHead77 use `overflow-x: hidden;` on the element thats scrolling
[07:23:32] <MetalHead77> jacobroufa: I'm using a single .html file layout where each div represents a different page. All of the pages can be scrolled horizontally
[07:24:01] <jacobroufa> so you can set it on the body then, or container div for all the pages
[07:26:49] <MetalHead77> jacobroufa: Are you sure this will work? have you ever done this before with jquerymobile?
[07:27:35] <jacobroufa> not with jquerymobile specifically, but i build responsive sites all day long and have to deal with similar issues
[07:28:09] <jacobroufa> its not specific to that framework, but when youre hiding things like a menu on the outside of the visible area it creates an overflow
[07:29:23] <BrazenBraden> i got an interesting situation.. I have a form which has multipart and is handles by ajax. When I edit normal fields and click Update, it works and ajax:sucess is triggered. HOWEVER when I chose an image to upload and then click Update, it appears as though nothing has happened but the image and fields do actually save. Just the ajax:success' code is not being called.. any idea why?
[07:29:37] <MetalHead77> jacobroufa: Reason why I asked is because your solution doesn't seem to a 100% fix or works
[07:29:47] <MetalHead77> jacobroufa: See here
[07:29:48] <MetalHead77> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11312383/prevent-horizontal-scroll-on-jquery-mobile

[07:34:53] <jacobroufa> @MetalHead77 like i said it is what works for me. just need to target the proper element

[07:35:59] <hollusion> i forgot how to check whether an jquqery object is a <div> or not
[07:36:14] <hollusion> *a jquery object
[07:36:32] <Duvdevan> if element is div then do something
[07:36:34] <Duvdevan> if not, who cares
[07:36:49] <hollusion> "if element is div"
[07:36:50] <MetalHead77> jacobroufa: Yes, but did it work for you with *jquerymobile*
[07:36:51] <hollusion> i need that part
[07:37:37] <hollusion> smth like .hasClass but for html elements. like .isElement('div')
[07:38:36] <hollusion> .is('div')
[07:38:42] <hollusion> how could i forget that
[07:38:57] <jacobroufa> :)
[07:42:06] <Duvdevan> if($('div').is('div')
[07:43:07] <seedmanc> Alright, so whoever suggested me to use http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/ to make sequential calls to ajax, I did it.
[07:43:41] <seedmanc> But this only lead to another problem because tumblr overwrites native promise implementation in index.js in the dashboard.
[07:43:50] <seedmanc> And the example by the link doesn't work. What do?
[07:51:02] <seedmanc> Can jQuery provide an alternative to native Promises to achieve same functionality as in the article?
[07:51:31] <seedmanc> I recall it has deferreds, but there were referred as unreliable by the link.
[08:09:00] <BillCriswell> seedmanc: What are you trying to do?
[08:11:35] <jrizzle88> is there a specific library that will achieve this? http://jsbin.com/muvoxebolo/2/edit The output we have are tables acting as rows with only the first results thead showing, we want to get the data for sorting but most libraries only work for 1 table at a time
[08:12:38] <seedmanc> A couple of days ago I went here asking how to make ajax responses arrive in the order ajax was called instead of random order due to its async nature. I was told to use promises as the example above shows exactly what I needed.
[08:13:39] <seedmanc> It works on most tumlbr pages (I mean individual blogs), but when I try to run that code on the dashboard page it fails because dashboard has its own javascript libraries that redefine Promise making it lack .resolve() function.
[08:15:20] <BillCriswell> do you need them to send, respond, send, respond, send, respond or would the sends happening before the respond be ok as long as the responds are in order?
[08:15:43] <BillCriswell> seedmanc: ^
[08:17:34] <BillCriswell> seedmanc: You might be looking for $.when.
[08:17:41] <BillCriswell> You can do like: var requests = [ $.get('/foo'), $.get('/bar'), $.get('/bar') ];
[08:17:58] <BillCriswell> Then: $.when.apply($, requests).done(function (fooResponse, barResponse, bazResponse) {  });
[08:18:18] <seedmanc> Hmm I wonder... technically whatever is faster would be preferred. The example I linked seems to call them over an array of values and then modify the page without waiting till all the responses arrive, but in the order that was in the array.
[08:19:17] <seedmanc> The thing is that the array is not created manually, but programmatically and while I can probably make an array of $.gets I dunno how to make that function with set of arguments like that.
[08:20:34] <seedmanc> Basically, I collect an array of data from the page that I run my userscript on, then I call API via ajax for every piece of that data and when response comes I write to page title numbers that should be in the order ajaxes were called.
[08:21:02] <BillCriswell> seedmanc: You can use the arguments list in the callback.
[08:21:40] <robertmaxrees> seedmanc yeah, you want promises.  http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/ covers the basics.
[08:21:50] <seedmanc> I did what it said.
[08:22:02] <seedmanc> It works but not when promise itself is redefined by third-party js.
[08:22:07] <BillCriswell> so you can do like.. .done(function () { var responses = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); /* responses[0] will be the first response in the array of requests */  });
[08:22:40] <seedmanc> Bill, thanks I will try that if I find no way to fix promises.
[08:22:45] <BillCriswell> .js> (function () { console.log(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)); }(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
[08:22:47] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[08:22:59] <BillCriswell> eh, works in my console haha
[08:23:34] <BillCriswell> .js> (function () { return Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); }(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
[08:23:42] <b-ot> BillCriswell: No output.
[08:23:45] <seedmanc> So this will work on arbitrary amount of array items, right? So that I won't have to set in in code.
[08:24:37] <BillCriswell> yeah, just add the requests to an array as you go along, when that array is all done it'll use the callback
[08:25:06] <seedmanc> robertmaxrees is there a way to retrieve native function code after it was overwritten?
[08:26:09] <robertmaxrees> seedmanc what's overriding native promises?
[08:26:42] <seedmanc> Some index.js file apparently that tumblr dashboard uses.
[08:26:58] <seedmanc> In their implementation there's no .resolve as it seems.
[08:27:24] <robertmaxrees> then not really.  you're not going to be able to guarantee anything at that point.  i'd lean on jquery's promises at that point and follow with BillCriswell is telling you.
[08:28:20] <seedmanc> I see, well thanks I'll try that.
[08:30:33] <seedmanc> Just one more question, the solution above will only give me list of responses when all requests have finished?
[08:31:02] <seedmanc> It would be slow and not as interactive as with promises giving responses as they arrive, but in proper order.
[08:31:54] <robertmaxrees> huh?  BillCriswell showed you exactly how to do that.
[08:33:15] <robertmaxrees> var requests = [ $.get('/foo'), $.get('/bar'), $.get('/bar') ]; $.when.apply($, requests).done(function () { var responses = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
[08:33:22] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[08:34:10] <robertmaxrees> the nice thing about promises is you'll decouple things really well from the start, so later on you'll be able to change how you handle things pretty easily.
[08:34:32] <seedmanc> So it won't be waiting till they're all finished, the callbacks will be fired as responses arrive?
[08:34:44] <robertmaxrees> baby steps :)
[08:34:58] <BillCriswell> seedmanc: but you want them in order, right?
[08:35:02] <seedmanc> Yes.
[08:35:07] <seedmanc> But not waiting till the last one.
[08:35:25] <seedmanc> Promises did it exactly this way I needed.
[08:36:21] <DarsVaeda> http://jsfiddle.net/wggcrnLg/ all events of sortable fire before the element is dragged off. how do I do this? drag something from right to left works, remove something from the left (drag to right) does not
[08:36:23] <BillCriswell> What you're describing sounds synchronous, which would be slower than asynchronous.
[08:36:38] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell he wants the responses to display in order.
[08:36:47] <robertmaxrees> but to fire everything asynchronously to get the data.
[08:36:58] <BillCriswell> ohhhh
[08:37:30] <BillCriswell> I was working with like half the situation there haha
[08:37:43] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing that's what they want, at least.
[08:39:30] <seedmanc> Yes i think so.
[08:39:46] <seedmanc> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-parallelism-sequencing this subarticle shows the desired result.
[08:40:18] <seedmanc> Calls are run in parallel but responses are show in order, it even provides the animation.
[08:41:50] <robertmaxrees> you'll probably need to translate this over to a jquery-fied version.
[08:43:28] <seedmanc> Well that's the help I need, then. The article mentions jquery, but it also says its deferreds are not standard-compatible or something.
[08:43:51] <robertmaxrees> it's because of how jquery currently handles errors.
[08:44:31] <robertmaxrees> that'll change with the next major release.
[08:44:44] <robertmaxrees> but that should have little impact on what you're doing here.
[08:45:29] <seedmanc> So is there a way to achieve same behaviour in jquery at all? The one shown in parallelism+sequencing section.
[08:45:37] <robertmaxrees> ... yes.
[08:46:01] <decx> do what?
[08:46:09] <seedmanc> Weird thing is, in Opera Presto it worked the right way without promises at all, I was calling ajax in $.each over an array and responses were in order. In chome they're random.
[08:46:27] <robertmaxrees> right, because there's no guarantee when things will finish.
[08:46:57] <seedmanc> As a result I was kinda thrown into promise world without prior knowledge about them. I copied the code from the site and it just happened to work properly for me until that problem.
[08:46:59] <robertmaxrees> decx they're trying to implement async fetching and then display results in the order they were called, without running ajax as a synchronous operation.
[08:47:04] <decx> is code.jquery.com borked?
[08:47:13] <robertmaxrees> decx not for me.
[08:47:18] <decx> must be cdn
[08:49:01] <robertmaxrees> seedmanc you should be able to translate things over pretty easily.  otherwise, use something like https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise before your code to flatten everything out.
[08:53:46] <seedmanc> So that link has promise implementation that I will be able to use instead of the redefined version?
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm giving you another option.  you could use that, use jquery promises, or refactor your code.  all sorts of ways to approach what you want to do.
[08:55:04] <seedmanc> I see thanks.
[08:55:25] <seedmanc> I'm still surprised that redefining native code is allowed and there's no going back.
[08:55:38] <seedmanc> jquery at least has .noconflict to avoid problems.
[08:55:46] <robertmaxrees> that's a different concept.
[08:56:04] <robertmaxrees> and it's not "redefining native code"
[08:56:21] <robertmaxrees> people redefine built-in prototypes - different concept, though there's a big reason you don't do it.
[08:56:41] <seedmanc> Why not? They have a function in their index.js that makes it impossible for me to use something that standards define.
[08:56:57] <seedmanc> Intead of refactoring their own code to be able to use standard functions.
[08:57:01] <robertmaxrees> you should avoid it because you end up in cases like this.
[08:57:50] <robertmaxrees> the built-in prototypes are what you're concerned with here.  they're not redefining native code, they're potentially redefining built-in objects.
[09:11:13] <xqo> is there some way to push values to an object property that is an array in one line? {x:[1,2]}.x.push(3)

[10:16:08] <robertmaxrees> sergez ... i'm not.  not sure if any team members are paying attention in here at the moment.  that's why I suggested you go to jquery-dev.
[10:16:29] <arthurvr> yo everybody
[10:16:36] <robertmaxrees> or arthurvr could show up :)
[10:16:51] <arthurvr> sergez: no specific date for now but just expect the beta reallllyyy quick.
[10:16:51] <crillegustafsson> Hi , I tried this --->
[10:16:52] <crillegustafsson> http://willowsystems.github.io/jSignature/#/demo/
[10:17:31] <sergez> arthurvr: understandable. Thanks for the answer arthurvr and thanks for the triaging robertmaxrees.
[10:17:36] <crillegustafsson> Can anyone show me how to change this to always been the same output
[10:17:59] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson not sure what you mean.
[10:18:24] <crillegustafsson> now I can choose at a lot , img, svg , base30, native ....
[10:18:35] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: what browser was that?
[10:18:42] <robertmaxrees> tasaif firefox.
[10:18:50] <tasaif> thanks
[10:18:50] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson https://github.com/willowsystems/jSignature this explains how.
[10:19:30] <crillegustafsson> I just want a button who sais "OK" and then it choose always same code
[10:19:48] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson specifically, https://github.com/willowsystems/jSignature#api this section - getData is what you want
[10:20:24] <sergez> is the setup for web fundamentals really that complicated?
[10:20:28] <sergez> not encouraging I'd say.
[10:20:34] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees,  ok
[10:21:06] <robertmaxrees> sergez for what now?
[10:21:33] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees ; have u tried ?
[10:21:33] <sergez> I am reading https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/?hl=en
[10:21:38] <sergez> looks difficult
[10:21:43] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson not sure what you mean.
[10:22:01] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees tried this code if its working?
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson nope.  you'd have to setup a fiddle.  should be pretty self-explanatory though.
[10:22:26] <robertmaxrees> sergez not difficult at all.
[10:23:41] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees --> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/a1s92dzx/3/
[10:24:28] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson what is this?  i thought you were looking at that plugin?
[10:24:30] <crillegustafsson> that picture I want to save on my site
[10:24:47] <crillegustafsson> yeah.. but this is something I build my own :P
[10:25:01] <crillegustafsson> which is best? :P
[10:25:10] <robertmaxrees> jSignature does what you want out of the box.
[10:25:16] <crillegustafsson> ok
[10:25:36] <robertmaxrees> $sigdiv.jSignature("getData", "format")
[10:25:42] <crillegustafsson> I put that on jdffilde
[10:25:47] <crillegustafsson> jsfiddle
[10:26:00] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson https://github.com/willowsystems/jSignature#data-import--export-and-plugins these are the valid formats available.
[10:26:20] <robertmaxrees> so you'd bind an event listener that'd run .jSignature("getData", "format")  against whatever your object is.
[10:38:24] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees ---> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/3j4e00s4/
[10:38:38] <crillegustafsson> now i can save it
[10:38:56] <crillegustafsson> but I want it to get same url always
[10:39:06] <crillegustafsson> for the save output name
[10:39:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:39:24] <crillegustafsson> it randomize different outputs name now
[10:39:31] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/44aclm6/
[10:39:34] <crillegustafsson> if you click save --> u get a url
[10:39:57] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.
[10:40:01] <robertmaxrees> you get an encoded image.
[10:40:25] <crillegustafsson> yes =) but it is some text in the url field
[10:40:34] <crillegustafsson> thats maybe the encodeded image ?
[10:40:39] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[10:40:53] <robertmaxrees> look at the fixee i just linked you.  otherwise, you should have what you need
[10:40:55] <crillegustafsson> ok.. but that text is not same if u save again right?
[10:41:08] <robertmaxrees> that text is the exact same - it's the encoded image.
[10:41:15] <crillegustafsson> yeah,, I looked at it :)
[10:41:41] <crillegustafsson> ok,, so it write over the next save?
[10:41:46] <crillegustafsson> replace it ?
[10:41:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:41:53] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[10:42:07] <robertmaxrees> because you're all over the place.
[10:42:14] <crillegustafsson> the thing is I wanna take this picture to a string and show on a site
[10:42:33] <crillegustafsson> if someone draw something new and hit save
[10:42:53] <crillegustafsson> I want the picture for the string to change
[10:43:09] <crillegustafsson> so it always changes and now create another image
[10:43:15] <crillegustafsson> not*
[10:43:16] <robertmaxrees> right - that's what you have now; the encoded image will change for every new image.
[10:43:23] <decx> canvas.toDataURL()
[10:43:25] <crillegustafsson> ok :D
[10:43:26] <crillegustafsson> haha
[10:43:31] <robertmaxrees> if the image is the same, it doesn't create a new one.
[10:43:42] <robertmaxrees> you already have that api setup.  prett simple stuff.
[10:43:57] <crillegustafsson> but if I draw a new one,, it replace the old one ?
[10:44:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't know what that means.
[10:44:13] <robertmaxrees> you generate a new base64 encoded image.
[10:44:32] <robertmaxrees> you have to save that data somewhere if you want it to persist.
[10:45:18] <crillegustafsson> it changes to new image
[10:45:21] <crillegustafsson> images
[10:45:35] <crillegustafsson> if u just paint something and hit save
[10:45:39] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:45:45] <robertmaxrees> you get a new base64 encoded image.
[10:45:53] <crillegustafsson> look at the url -- the last numbers/letters
[10:46:19] <crillegustafsson> if I paint again and hit save... I got a different numbers/letters
[10:46:22] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:46:28] <robertmaxrees> because it's generating a new image.
[10:46:30] <crillegustafsson> so it doesnt write the "same" code
[10:46:33] <robertmaxrees> that "url" isn't a url.
[10:46:41] <crillegustafsson> yeah.. =) now to the thing
[10:46:42] <robertmaxrees> it's the base64 encoded version of the image.
[10:46:48] <crillegustafsson> I want it to do same url
[10:46:52] <crillegustafsson> same code
[10:46:54] <crillegustafsson> same image
[10:47:29] <crillegustafsson> if I upate my old image, its overwritten with the new one
[10:47:39] <robertmaxrees> right, because it's a new image.
[10:47:44] <robertmaxrees> you need to save it somewhere.
[10:47:45] <crillegustafsson> yeah :P
[10:47:59] <crillegustafsson> ok, how to do that? :P
[10:48:11] <robertmaxrees> you could use a form post or ajax.
[10:48:17] <tasaif> or local storage right?
[10:48:29] <crillegustafsson> ok, then it will save over and over the same image?
[10:48:30] <robertmaxrees> sure, depending on browser support needs.
[10:48:42] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson your backend could decide on what to do.
[10:48:50] <crillegustafsson> just so it works with Chrome =)
[10:48:51] <robertmaxrees> you could replace their last image, or make a new one.
[10:48:57] <robertmaxrees> localstorage could work.
[10:49:01] <robertmaxrees> lots of choices.
[10:49:19] <crillegustafsson> I want to have it local now, but later I gonna upload it to my FTP server
[10:49:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll need a webserver for that to work.
[10:49:42] <crillegustafsson> got my website and everthing =)
[10:49:45] <crillegustafsson> so its done.
[10:49:50] <crillegustafsson> just need the code to work :D
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
[10:50:00] <robertmaxrees> fwiw localstorage doesn't "Share" between people.
[10:50:05] <robertmaxrees> that just saves it for the current user.,
[10:50:43] <crillegustafsson> ok, it doesnt matter,, just so it saves
[10:50:44] <tasaif> crillegustafsson: can I ask what you're trying to do exactly?
[10:51:15] <crillegustafsson> yeah,, Im having a PDF generate done
[10:51:25] <robertmaxrees> then setup the server-side for this.
[10:51:29] <crillegustafsson> so I got everything I want on that pdf,,
[10:51:42] <crillegustafsson> now I just need this signature to get added to this PDF
[10:51:55] <tasaif> you're uploading a canvas to a server to convert it to a pdf?
[10:52:07] <robertmaxrees> they want to upload the base64 encoded image, tasaif
[10:52:17] <phpcoder> hello
[10:52:20] <crillegustafsson> yeah,, but Im get a image to put on the pdf
[10:52:32] <crillegustafsson> and the image is this signature
[10:52:44] <crillegustafsson> so I just need signature to save to my folder
[10:52:48] <crillegustafsson> and Im done
[10:52:49] <phpcoder> this works      $(".ajax_content").html(data);                       this NOT      $(this).find(".ajax_content").html(data);
[10:53:01] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson yeah, upload the base64 encoded image.
[10:53:11] <phpcoder> .ajax_content is inside my object
[10:53:11] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder what is $(this) in that context?
[10:53:21] <decx> if this is a flat structure then find won't work
[10:53:27] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:53:42] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/8bd07fe883424c122445
[10:54:03] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder $(this) isn't what you think it is in that case.
[10:54:08] <decx> you want $(data)
[10:54:13] <robertmaxrees> your 'this' reference changes in that second function.
[10:54:21] <crillegustafsson> its feels close but its hard to get it the image to saves to a folder
[10:54:29] <robertmaxrees> decx it's a plugin: $.fn.loadAgentProfile = function (agentId) {}
[10:54:30] <phpcoder> oh right!!
[10:54:45] <robertmaxrees> they probably mean $(this) to be the element they're running loadAgentProfile() against.
[10:54:53] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, exactly
[10:55:09] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson you need to use a form post or ajax to ship data to your server
[10:55:12] <decx> .bind(this) behind your functions
[10:55:19] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees how to upload a image base64
[10:55:21] <decx> or just cache this
[10:55:25] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson it's just a string.
[10:55:32] <robertmaxrees> you upload like any other string.
[10:55:32] <phpcoder> ok so i can do $this = $(this)
[10:55:34] <phpcoder> outside?
[10:55:37] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees im listening =)
[10:55:38] <decx> yep
[10:55:40] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder yeah.
[10:55:42] <tasaif> lol
[10:55:47] <phpcoder> k
[10:55:49] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson ... uh
[10:55:50] <phpcoder> thanks guys!
[10:56:02] <crillegustafsson> can you show in my jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/3j4e00s4/
[10:56:03] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson http://learn.jquery.com/
[10:56:30] <robertmaxrees> signaturePad.toDataURL() - send this as text to your server.
[10:56:33] <phpcoder> guys last thing...
[10:56:34] <phpcoder> can i do
[10:56:39] <phpcoder> $this.find('.ajax_content submit').bind("click", $.fn.editAgentProfile);
[10:56:46] <robertmaxrees> sure, but it's a bad idea.
[10:56:48] <phpcoder> i mean using "$.fn.editAgentProfile"
[10:56:52] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, why ?
[10:56:54] <robertmaxrees> bad ideas all around.
[10:57:01] <robertmaxrees> use the delegated syntax of .on() instead.
[10:57:25] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, ok so i can use $.fn.editAgentProfile          on .on()
[10:57:29] <robertmaxrees> and $.fn.editAgentProfile won't hold the reference you expect it to unless you use the native js .bind() tp pass around the reference.
[10:57:39] <tasaif> crillegustafsson: you can put the string in a hidden field inside a form and submit the form
[10:57:42] <robertmaxrees> $this.find('.ajax_content submit').bind("click", $.fn.editAgentProfile); is a bad pattern to begin with.
[10:57:56] <tasaif> or you can redirect the page with a GET variable that has the image as a variable
[10:58:11] <tasaif> or you can send the data via ajax
[10:58:13] <robertmaxrees> $('.someContainer').on('click', '.ajax_content submit', someFunction) phpcoder
[10:58:36] <tasaif> the easiest one is the hidden field inside a form
[10:58:46] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, i would like to use plugin's method
[10:59:01] <robertmaxrees> phpcoder that doesn't really make sense.
[10:59:08] <robertmaxrees> what is the plugin running against in that case?
[10:59:39] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're trying to reinitialize a plugin when you load new content, yeah?
[10:59:45] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, only to keep the code togheter... i mean i wouldl ike to organizs the code better
[11:00:13] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees,  no i only would like to pass a function when i click on submit
[11:00:42] <robertmaxrees> then do $('.someContainer').on('click', '.ajax_content submit', someFunction) - whatever that function is.
[11:00:51] <robertmaxrees> no clue why it's in the method namespace though.
[11:01:12] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, can i use "document" as .someCOntainer
[11:01:13] <phpcoder> ?
[11:01:19] <phpcoder> where you used it
[11:01:42] <robertmaxrees> you can, but you should try to bind lower if possible.
[11:01:54] <phpcoder> ok
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> if you do that, move the binding outside of your ajax call btw.
[11:02:00] <decx> you do $('elelemt').editAgentProfile(agentid) so you alreasdy have a static parent that you can bind to outside your get
[11:02:13] <robertmaxrees> ^ exactly.
[11:02:22] <robertmaxrees> you want to avoid having to bind listeners.
[11:02:43] <phpcoder> ok
[11:02:45] <decx> if you have multiple elements you also need to loop through them
[11:07:37] <forQuery> so... when i console.log(someElement)  I get .anElement      but after when i say var jQueryElement =  $(someElement);  i get an error jQueryElement is not defined.
[11:07:43] <phpcoder> guys last thing
[11:07:53] <phpcoder> can i add an event when a particular div is visible
[11:07:55] <phpcoder> i mean...
[11:07:59] <phpcoder> when the page isl oaded
[11:08:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:08:10] <phpcoder> i need to get some content via ajax
[11:08:20] <phpcoder> to fill a  box
[11:08:21] <robertmaxrees> do you want to know if the div exists?
[11:08:24] <robertmaxrees> or is visible?
[11:08:44] <phpcoder> visible
[11:08:53] <robertmaxrees> you can check :visible
[11:09:01] <robertmaxrees> or for the particular css you're using to hide it.
[11:09:09] <phpcoder> ok
[11:09:29] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, can i not use an event?
[11:09:38] <phpcoder> i mean.....when visible call a method ?
[11:09:43] <robertmaxrees> there's no event for that.
[11:09:57] <robertmaxrees> you're convoluting events :)
[11:10:21] <phpcoder> :)
[11:10:32] <robertmaxrees> not every little occurance in the browser has an associated event.
[11:11:01] <tasaif> you can make your own event
[11:11:07] <tasaif> to convolute things even more
[11:11:15] <tasaif> and have a custom hide/show
[11:11:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah let's not confuse this dude though.
[11:11:25] <phpcoder> ok
[11:11:28] <robertmaxrees> the act of the div hiding and showing doesn't fire an event.
[11:11:53] <robertmaxrees> you could fire one yourself manually, but that doesn't really make much sense imo.
[11:11:53] <phpcoder> i can check if exists checking .lenght ?
[11:11:58] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:12:00] <phpcoder> ok
[11:12:01] <decx> you want to check once on load?
[11:12:09] <phpcoder> decx, y
[11:12:17] <robertmaxrees> if ($('.someSelector').length) { console.log('ohai'); }
[11:14:12] <phpcoder> perfect
[11:14:58] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees,  i still can create normal method inside jquery context
[11:14:59] <phpcoder> right?
[11:15:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:15:18] <phpcoder> gist
[11:15:41] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[11:15:53] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d88344b1444288de2345
[11:16:08] <phpcoder> as you can see i put all the code in $( document ).ready(function() {...}
[11:16:12] <robertmaxrees> right?
[11:16:23] <phpcoder> ok but i would like to create function inside $( document ).ready(function() { HERE }
[11:16:35] <robertmaxrees> sure, you can do that.  no need to though.
[11:16:37] <phpcoder> because in this canse when the document is loaded this $.get start automatically
[11:16:45] <phpcoder> but i want ot start it only in a certain case
[11:16:57] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, normal function bla() {...}
[11:17:56] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/wj7f06w/
[11:17:57] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[11:18:26] <robertmaxrees> no need to cram everything inside of your document ready.
[11:18:36] <phpcoder> let me see
[11:18:38] <phpcoder> thank you!!
[11:18:59] <phpcoder> PERFECT
[11:19:01] <phpcoder> thank you!
[11:20:03] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees, do i always need to use $ to call those functions right?
[11:26:21] <forQuery> i was trying to find a good wrapper for my shard global object...  is this a good way to start / end it?
[11:26:22] <forQuery> http://pastie.org/10183001
[11:26:24] <Ajkthx-work> http://www.csbcamp.com/dashboard.php - any idea how i can animate these collapse functions? css transitions don't seem to be working
[11:31:44] <Ajkthx-work> http://www.csbcamp.com/dashboard.php - any idea how i can animate these collapse functions? css transitions don't seem to be working
[11:39:44] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: An inline element can't have height. Also, make sure you animate from a number to another number.
[11:40:06] <Ajkthx-work> so how can i fix it?
[11:40:12] <Ajkthx-work> display: anything doesnt work
[11:40:30] <BillCriswell> Are you animating a number to a number?
[11:40:37] <Ajkthx-work> the animate works 100%
[11:40:43] <Ajkthx-work> i know this because everything else on the site is animated
[11:40:50] <Ajkthx-work> everything else i've tried to animate also works
[11:40:56] <Ajkthx-work> for some reason this animate doesnt work though
[11:41:10] <BillCriswell> are you animating a number to a number?
[11:41:44] <BillCriswell> you can't animate to height: auto; from 0, you'd need to animate to height: Npx;
[11:42:09] <Ajkthx-work> im so confused
[11:42:29] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ritoxi/1/edit?html,css,output
[11:43:08] <Ajkthx-work> its not transitioning at all
[11:43:27] <Ajkthx-work> not smoothly anyway
[11:43:37] <robertmaxrees> the bin isn't?
[11:43:51] <Ajkthx-work> not the red block
[11:43:57] <robertmaxrees> works great here.
[11:43:59] <Ajkthx-work> i mean it changes from small to big
[11:44:03] <Ajkthx-work> but it doesnt smoothly transition into it
[11:44:09] <robertmaxrees> it does for me.
[11:44:15] <robertmaxrees> IE11, FF, and Chrome.
[11:44:18] <Ajkthx-work> guess firefox doesnt work
[11:44:21] <Ajkthx-work> must have a shit version
[11:44:27] <Ajkthx-work> chrome works
[11:44:27] <robertmaxrees> old version maybe?
[11:44:30] <Ajkthx-work> must be
[11:44:38] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[11:44:44] <Ajkthx-work> im using chrome now
[11:44:48] <Ajkthx-work> probably some really old version
[11:44:58] <Ajkthx-work> so this works on here, but i dont know or see how to translate that into my site
[11:45:44] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: You've set the div to display: inline, you can't set a height on display: inline element.
[11:46:25] <Ajkthx-work> i know, you've said that 40 times
[11:46:30] <Ajkthx-work> so change it to what?
[11:46:33] <robertmaxrees> block.
[11:46:41] <robertmaxrees> or inline-block
[11:47:31] <BillCriswell> You also can't animate transition display.
[11:47:52] <BillCriswell> er, minus animate
[11:52:08] <Ajkthx-work> this makes no sense
[11:52:14] <robertmaxrees> where are you stuck?
[11:53:04] <Ajkthx-work> it just isn't working
[11:53:10] <Ajkthx-work> display: block doesn't help it in any way
[11:53:12] <Ajkthx-work> idk what im doing
[11:53:14] <Ajkthx-work> im so frustrated
[11:53:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd isolate it into a fiddle or bin.
[11:53:37] <robertmaxrees> kind of like BillCriswell did - see if you can't get it to work there.
[11:53:46] <Ajkthx-work> im just going to not have transitions
[11:53:51] <robertmaxrees> :(
[11:53:52] <Ajkthx-work> i dont understand it and i dont even care at this point
[11:54:58] <Ajkthx-work> no idea how a transition can be so unrealistically complicated
[11:55:05] <robertmaxrees> it's really not.
[11:55:46] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: Is the code on the site you linked what you currently have?
[11:57:32] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: Here's a super plain demo: http://jsbin.com/ritoxi/2/edit
[11:57:53] <Ajkthx-work> this doesnt help me
[11:57:54] <Ajkthx-work> at all
[11:57:57] <Ajkthx-work> because it's not on my site
[11:58:00] <Ajkthx-work> and i dont know what im doing
[11:58:13] <Ajkthx-work> its cool that this happened and you made this
[11:58:14] <jdo_dk> How do i change my selector, so i want "match" if li has class="disabled" ? https://jsfiddle.net/g04xpw7L/
[11:58:15] <Ajkthx-work> but again, it doesnt help
[11:58:32] <robertmaxrees> Ajkthx-work we're trying to figure out how to help you.
[11:58:36] <BillCriswell> I'm not doing the plain demo for me.
[11:58:46] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk huh?
[11:58:49] <Ajkthx-work> this http://www.csbcamp.com/dashboard.php
[11:58:59] <Ajkthx-work> is the current coee
[11:59:00] <Ajkthx-work> code*
[11:59:09] <robertmaxrees> where is the relevant css file?
[11:59:11] <robertmaxrees> link that.
[11:59:21] <Ajkthx-work> idk
[11:59:46] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: You're changing display. Just leave display alone and animate height.
[11:59:55] <BillCriswell> You can't transition display.
[12:00:02] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell they don't know whjere the relevant css is...
[12:00:03] <jdo_dk> robertmaxrees: Link "Another action" is disabled. And if the class disabled is on the "li" parent, i dont want the "listener to match. Hope this makes any sense. :D
[12:00:18] <Ajkthx-work> you mean main.css
[12:00:21] <robertmaxrees> you need to chekc in the listener if it's disabled.
[12:00:22] <Ajkthx-work> like, as in, main.css
[12:00:29] <Ajkthx-work> like as in, www.csbcamp.com/main.css
[12:00:40] <Ajkthx-work> like as in, the only css file i have?
[12:00:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to dig around to figure out what is where :)
[12:01:07] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk i assume you mean something like: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/g04xpw7L/1/
[12:01:14] <jdo_dk> robertmaxrees: I know i can to like: if($(this).parent().hasCLass("disabled")) Do nothing. But cant i do it with pure selectors ?
[12:01:32] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: Did you see my message?
[12:01:40] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk not the way you're thinking. $("#clickMe").click(function(){}); runs once on pageload.
[12:01:42] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't update.
[12:02:02] <Ajkthx-work> bill, i understand to animate height, but i dont KNOW how to animate the height
[12:02:04] <Ajkthx-work> or where to put what
[12:02:06] <Ajkthx-work> or what values to change
[12:02:10] <Ajkthx-work> or what part of the css to change
[12:02:11] <jdo_dk> I can put it on on(...) then.
[12:02:17] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk huh?
[12:02:27] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk .on() only runs once on pageload, as well.
[12:02:37] <robertmaxrees> you could uise a delegated listener though.
[12:03:27] <jdo_dk> in pseudo code i was thinking of something like: li:NOT_DISABLED #clickMe)...
[12:04:08] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk does the disabled class change after pageload?
[12:04:16] <robertmaxrees> because there's https://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[12:04:27] <jdo_dk> robertmaxrees: Can happen yes.
[12:04:33] <robertmaxrees> then youy can't use a selector.
[12:04:41] <robertmaxrees> unless you're in a delegated event listener.
[12:05:38] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: .content_infoblock
[12:06:02] <Ajkthx-work> that is a class in my css file
[12:06:20] <BillCriswell> You want: transition: 0.5s all; height: 0; overflow: hidden; then .hide:target ~ .content_infoblock { height: 200px; }
[12:07:22] <Ajkthx-work> well there you go, that worked
[12:07:23] <Ajkthx-work> thank you
[12:08:00] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[12:08:06] <Ajkthx-work> so it HAS to be a set px?
[12:08:12] <Ajkthx-work> it can't just be to the height of what's inside the div?
[12:14:41] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: unfortunatley not. You can trick it with like.. max-height: 0; max-height: (some number that's high enough to show text in all cases)
[12:14:53] <BillCriswell> but that can mess with the animation times (more noticeably when closing.
[12:15:35] <Ajkthx-work> ill just fill each how it will be and then set the hight with a new class each time
[12:19:13] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: Woudl be how to fake it a bit in case you're curious: http://jsbin.com/xonifo/1/edit?html,css,output
[12:22:12] <seemikehack> I'm guessing it's expected behavior for a border to capture a hover event but an outline not to, correct?
[12:23:05] <BillCriswell> seemikehack: Hmm... thinking it might depend on the box model?
[12:23:37] <Palmer11> border is apart of the element
[12:24:24] <BillCriswell> You know what.. that actually sounds a lot more logical.
[12:24:38] <BillCriswell> Not sure what I was thinking.
[12:25:02] <seemikehack> Palmer11: I knew that border was and outline wasn't, I'm just trying not to have to deal with negative margins and such :/
[12:25:37] <Palmer11> what do you mean by negative margins?
[12:26:45] <cjohnson> $('a').closest('div').addClass('foo') is this equivalent to $('a').each(function() { $(this).closest('div').addClass('foo'); }); ?>
[12:26:57] <cjohnson> ie does .closest operate on each element in the collection?
[12:27:06] <cjohnson> and return a new collection of parents
[12:27:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/closest/ - : For each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.
[12:27:38] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees : what did you say about saving url to image?
[12:27:46] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson huh?
[12:27:46] <seemikehack> Palmer11: I've got a weird use case, trying to get an absolutlely-positioned floating element (call it a palette) to show up when I hover another element (call it an editor) but not disappear when I try to move into it.
[12:27:53] <crillegustafsson> http://jsfiddle.net/crillegustafsson/3j4e00s4/
[12:28:05] <robertmaxrees> i never said anything about saving a URL to an image.
[12:28:10] <cjohnson> derp thanks robertmaxrees
[12:28:25] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson :) deffo
[12:29:21] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees Have tried that link u send me without any success
[12:29:23] <Palmer11> seemikehack: if you place the element as a child, then it wont disappear when you move into it.
[12:29:27] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson what link?
[12:29:30] <robertmaxrees> what have you tried?
[12:29:53] <robertmaxrees> and don't link me to the same fiddle - show me the specific code you're working with.
[12:30:00] <crillegustafsson> this link --> http://fixee.org/paste/44aclm6/
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> ... that was specific to jSignature duder.
[12:30:15] <BillCriswell> How do you all feel about JS writing CSS?
[12:30:22] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell eeeehhh...
[12:30:25] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[12:30:33] <robertmaxrees> also: not doable without hacks in IE.
[12:30:35] <robertmaxrees> *old IE.
[12:30:44] <seemikehack> Palmer11: The floating element is a child of the static element, but it's absolutely positioned outside of its parent, so when I leave the parent to get to the child, I lose the hover event and the child disappears.
[12:30:55] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees oh ok, so what that this code do ?
[12:30:56] <BillCriswell> I'm trying to think of the best way to animate to the height of an element.
[12:31:13] <BillCriswell> without manually inputting the height everywhere haha
[12:31:21] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson this code initializes jSignature() and then calls the "getData" action on it.
[12:31:29] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson i pointed you to their docs.
[12:32:47] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees me and my friend was reading , but we didnt understand how to work with it
[12:33:09] <BillCriswell> ehh the height could change on a response site.
[12:33:12] <crillegustafsson> a lot of short codes but no guide lines
[12:33:18] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson i'd strongly suggest you read learn.jquery.com
[12:33:26] <BillCriswell> Remembering why I avoid this accordian like shit.
[12:33:29] <BillCriswell> accordion*
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> because what you're trying to do is VERY simple.
[12:33:40] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell aaaah.  yeah.  that's always been a funky one.
[12:33:50] <robertmaxrees> we always just say "this is the mind and the max" and everything has to fit.
[12:34:05] <BillCriswell> haha
[12:34:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:34:11] <robertmaxrees> redefine the problem.
[12:34:19] <crillegustafsson> robertmaxrees : we are both students and none of these code have we been working with
[12:34:26] <crillegustafsson> bad school :P
[12:34:38] <robertmaxrees> crillegustafsson which is why i'm suggesting learn.jquery.com
[12:34:53] <robertmaxrees> there are some basics you're not fully understanding that'll really clear things up for you.
[12:35:23] <crillegustafsson> yeah, ok , where to start reading for getting a quick understanding of this problem?
[12:35:36] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[12:35:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to visit the basics
[12:35:50] <crillegustafsson> we really havent time for a BIG book right now, cause we are ending this in 2 weeks
[12:36:01] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to bit off more than you can chew.
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> *bite
[12:36:12] <BillCriswell> Ajkthx-work: Here is how you might approach it properly.. but if you're going responsive you'll need to recalculate shit on reisze a bit too often for my liking
[12:36:14] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/xonifo/2/edit?js,output
[12:36:23] <jdo_dk> robertmaxrees: I used the code: if($(this).parent().hasClass("disabled")) Thanks mate.
[12:36:45] <BillCriswell> unless you keep a close of the element off screen.
[12:36:45] <robertmaxrees> jdo_dk you can also do if ($(this).closest('disabled').length) {} instead
[12:36:57] <BillCriswell> keep a clone*
[12:37:00] <jdo_dk> parent() is ok.
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> meh, mind decouples the logic from the markup a little more, but whatever floats your boat.
[12:37:34] <robertmaxrees> *mine
[12:37:53] <jdo_dk> ;)
[12:40:13] <seemikehack> Can I get a margin to overlay other content without displacing it?
[12:40:32] <seemikehack> Or a border, either.
[12:42:14] <kevireilly> seemikehack: to make an element not move when adding a border, you can use a negative margin of the same border-width
[12:42:34] <seemikehack> kevireilly: on the element or its parent?
[12:42:58] <kevireilly> seemikehack: element receiving the border IE: border: 2px solid #fff; margin: -2px;
[12:43:10] <seemikehack> kevireilly: giving it a go.
[12:47:14] <seemikehack> kevireilly: that actually worked swimmingly, once I figured out what I wanted :) thanks!
[12:47:32] <kevireilly> seemikehack: excellent. No problem at all.
[13:07:13] <bigmac> im having a hard time finding a working example of loading divs when they page scrolls down
[13:07:45] <bigmac> i have been looking at all kinds of jsfiddle net examples
[13:09:59] <seemikehack> bigmac: that's a pretty broad topic.
[13:10:11] <seemikehack> bigmac: given that it's not much to go on, try this: http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/guides/getting-started/
[13:10:48] <bigmac> i have stumbled across waypoints, ill look more into it
[13:10:52] <bigmac> thanks for the link
[13:11:12] <seemikehack> bigmac: thanks for the question, I discovered Waypoints.
[13:11:42] <decx> typically you either test your elements offsety on scroll and compare it to the scrollposition
[13:11:52] <decx> or you map the offsets on load/resize whatever
[13:12:02] <decx> and have it a bit faster for many elements
[13:12:43] <seemikehack> decx: I think he was talking about a dynamic-loading type of situation.
[13:12:53] <seemikehack> decx: don't really know, though :)
[13:14:35] <bigmac> i plan on displaying 30 divs about 1000 pix height per div...
[13:14:49] <bigmac> maybe it is a dynamic loading when scrolling ?
[13:18:32] <seemikehack> bigmac: I can only assume that you want to render the first five, then when you get to the bottom of the screen, load and render the next five, and it's turtles all the way down. Am I close?
[13:19:22] <bigmac> seemikehack: yah sounds about right..
[13:19:48] <decx> do you just want to get it done or do you want to learn how it works?
[13:20:14] <decx> if it's the first then just use waypoints, it's pretty mature at this point
[13:20:36] <seemikehack> bigmac: the Waypoints library isn't necessary for that, but it seems helpful, and it was the first link in the first result from a google search for "jquery dynamically load div on scroll"
[13:20:43] <seemikehack> bigmac: what decx said.
[13:21:07] <bigmac> i would like to see a lighter version of "what is doing the work"
[13:21:24] <decx> i'll whip something up
[13:25:49] <ph88> is    true    valid date to send with $.ajax ?
[13:26:59] <seemikehack> ph88: so many problems with that question...
[13:27:13] <seemikehack> ph88: valid 'data' or valid 'date'?
[13:27:26] <tasaif> or validate*
[13:27:53] <ph88> data
[13:28:23] <seemikehack> ph88: just the literal 'true'? probably not.
[13:28:44] <robertmaxrees> that reallyu depends.
[13:28:46] <ph88> without the quotes
[13:28:47] <seemikehack> ph88: I imagine the data property takes key-value pairs.
[13:28:57] <robertmaxrees> it can be anything.
[13:29:06] <seemikehack> ph88: I guess it depends on your implementation, then.
[13:29:09] <robertmaxrees> a plain string, some JSON, etc.
[13:29:15] <seemikehack> ph88 like robertmaxrees said.
[13:29:38] <seemikehack> I stand corrected.
[13:29:55] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ - docs state it can be a PlainObject, String, or Array :)
[13:30:04] <seemikehack> Hah, beat me to it ;)
[13:30:14] <ph88> so not a boolean ?
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> those are objects.
[13:30:29] <ph88> oh i didn't know that
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> everything in JS is an object.
[13:30:39] <seemikehack> Everything is an Object!
[13:30:45] <seemikehack> Man, beat me again!
[13:30:45] <robertmaxrees> strings, arrays, numbers... even functions.
[13:31:41] <Guest48892>  Hello, I'm wondering what settings did they use for the header text? https://zenland.io/
[13:31:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:32:14] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean. what "settings"?
[13:32:58] <Guest48892> robertmaxrees, I know that they are using the jQuery plugin, SlabText, but now I'm wondering what settings, Options did they use to make it boxed like that?
[13:33:12] <tasaif> what if you could add functions together?
[13:33:35] <bobbywilson0> Is there a way to skip parsing a response on an ajax request? It comes back as json, but says unexpected token because I am sending a jsonp request
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> Guest48892 you'd have to peruse the page source and go from there.
[13:33:53] <robertmaxrees> bobbywilson0 then it's not json.
[13:34:08] <robertmaxrees> use jsonp as the datatype.
[13:34:29] <Guest48892> robertmaxrees, Is there any other option to SlabText, since the Docs isn't really going through all settings
[13:35:27] <bobbywilson0> robertmaxrees: it validates (https://gist.github.com/bobbywilson0/d67b54e8210ec5e0a758), and I am using the jsonp datatype
[13:36:09] <robertmaxrees> bobbywilson0 share your js.
[13:36:24] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn';t bitch at you if you have your ajax call setup right.
[13:37:19] <bobbywilson0> robertMeeting: https://gist.github.com/bobbywilson0/064fddce21720fd5cf01
[13:37:49] <robertMeeting> try ditching the type and dataType.
[13:37:51] <robertMeeting> see what happens.
[13:38:38] <bobbywilson0> robertMeeting: CORS errors
[13:40:00] <robertMeeting> iiinteresting.
[13:40:05] <robertMeeting> something about your response is bad.
[13:40:52] <NoiseEee> crossDomain: true    is also needed is it not?
[13:43:57] <tasaif> is there a way in javascript to convert a function to a string on a single line?
[13:44:06] <tasaif> (without newlines)
[13:48:03] <b-ot> gf3 lol
[13:48:09] <gf3> ok
[13:52:47] <christoph_> i am using jquery-ui draggable is there a good way to stop mouse propagation if the mouse leaves the parent of the draggable
[13:53:21] <tasaif> can you rephrase your question?
[13:53:42] <tasaif> namely the stop mouse propagation part
[13:54:45] <christoph_> i will try
[13:55:26] <christoph_> i want to forbid any mousemovement out of an html div if a jquery ui draggable is in drag-mode
[13:55:29] <christoph_> better ? :S :D
[13:56:40] <tasaif> you mean you want to give the item you're dragging a minimum and a maximum x and y value?
[13:57:51] <tasaif> or you want to actually limit the mouse movement?
[13:58:36] <christoph_> yes
[13:58:52] <tasaif> that sounds like a bad design choice, but I'll see if I can figure something out
[14:00:14] <christoph_> i just found this ui.position.left = Math.min( 100, ui.position.left );
[14:00:21] <christoph_> maybe thats a good idea
[14:00:40] <tasaif> yea, it looks like you can't do anything with the mouse through javascript
[14:01:03] <tasaif> best case if you wanted to accomplish it, you would have to create your own mouse cursor
[14:01:14] <tasaif> which is even worse
[14:01:31] <christoph_> jeah anyway, thanks a lot
[14:01:34] <tasaif> np
[14:04:29] <phpcoder> hello
[14:05:10] <phpcoder> how can i call function inside (function() {      HERE        }()); ?
[14:05:34] <phpcoder> i have this function   var loadAgentProfile = function(agentId) { .....}
[14:06:24] <_mak> how can I find a TR by id?
[14:06:35] <tasaif> $('tr#id')
[14:07:18] <robertMeeting> just $('#id')
[14:07:28] <robertMeeting> since you can only have an ID once per page.
[14:07:34] <robertMeeting> phpcoder you can't outside of that functon.
[14:07:37] <robertMeeting> because of scope.
[14:07:38] <_mak> it is returnin empty
[14:07:45] <_mak> returning
[14:08:04] <robertMeeting> are you using that ID more than once?
[14:08:19] <NoiseEee> (or at all)
[14:08:25] <_mak> robertMeeting: yes
[14:08:56] <_mak> <tr id="row-template">
[14:09:19] <_mak> I should find it with $("#row-template") right?
[14:12:28] <tasaif> yes
[14:12:47] <tasaif> maybe you're executing the code before the object is on the page?
[14:15:38] <_mak> tasaif: I'm executing it on the console
[14:15:48] <_mak> weird, I'll look further into it
[14:16:22] <tasaif> :|
[14:18:13] <jrizzle88> anyone ever sort a foreach table loop? each row is a table basically containing nested data within each
[14:18:21] <ph88> seemikehack: chrome doesn't set true or false with ajax ... just tested it
[14:29:26] <fatchina> would http2 have a significant impac ton jquery
[14:29:34] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:29:56] <robertmaxrees> jquery is almost entirely unaware of the protocol.
[14:31:45] <fatchina> what about web development in general
[14:33:00] <robertmaxrees> it will enable pages to download faster and bring about "push" responses.
[14:33:13] <robertmaxrees> plus some other stuff - it'll make things faster and improve some technological concepts.
[14:36:42] <seemikehack> tasaif: how do you feel about Google's Material Design guidelines.
[14:36:46] <seemikehack> ph88: ...
[14:37:04] <seemikehack> tasaif: Sorry, meant that as a question.
[14:37:48] <tasaif> no worries
[14:37:54] <tasaif> I've never heard of them ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:38:10] <tasaif> looking at it now
[14:38:38] <seemikehack> tasaif: I just read your comment about restricting mouse movement.
[14:39:07] <tasaif> ah
[14:39:30] <tasaif> I put myself in the user's shoes to make my design choices
[14:40:51] <tasaif> can you imagine moving the mouse, and it staying in the same place. if you're using a normal mouse, you're going to have to lift the mouse and bring it back. that's not ok
[14:41:32] <tasaif> I call it derek's conservation of mouse movement law
[14:45:36] <tasaif> seemikehack: it looks like it's well thought out
[14:53:41] <mcfdez87> Hello. Anyone knows how can I add a html to append like this? http://pastebin.com/jBUt0SqV
[14:56:47] <tasaif> http://api.jquery.com/append/
[14:57:46] <tasaif> or do you mean multiline strings?
[14:58:31] <mcfdez87> tasaif, multiline

[14:58:57] <tasaif> end each line with a '\'
[15:20:48] <phpcoder> how to post an entire form that also has file input?
[15:22:06] <tasaif> submit it
[15:22:38] <robertmaxrees> you mean via ajax or what?
[15:33:16] <phpcoder> robertmaxrees,  via ajax
[15:33:19] <phpcoder> $.post
[15:34:17] <robertmaxrees> !g ajax submit form with file

[15:34:42] <phpcoder> thanks
[16:12:56] <Lencl> >_<
[16:13:07] <Lencl> https://jsfiddle.net/m2q196qt/
[16:13:41] <Lencl> As you can see, I'm appending divs and wrapping it around <div class='item'>
[16:14:05] <Lencl> but when you can check the result, the <div class='item'> isn't wrapped...
[16:14:49] <robertmaxrees> Lencl you can only append full fragments.
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> you're not appending raw html, you're appending nodes.
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> so it sees $elem.append('<div class="item">');  and closes is automatically for you.
[16:15:27] <Lencl> is there a way to append raw html?
[16:15:40] <robertmaxrees> not the way you want.
[16:15:49] <Lencl> ah I see
[16:16:10] <Lencl> reason why I don't add it all together is because there is an element that *may* need to be in-between
[16:16:17] <Lencl> so I need to insert an if-statement
[16:16:31] <robertmaxrees> no need for that, either.
[16:16:32] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:17:50] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/m2q196qt/1/
[16:17:59] <robertmaxrees> you can then conditionally .append() the node you want.
[16:34:26] <Lencl> ahh nice thank you
[18:43:01] <Dimik> jquery mobile kicks ass!
[18:49:27] <forQuery> $(document).on( event, selector, function )   is it better to do this... or to have a more focused selector    $("#closestSharedParent").on( event, selector, function )
[18:50:17] <forQuery> for event delegation
[18:50:20] <forQuery> do you want to start at document
[18:50:24] <forQuery> or start at closest shared paernt
[18:52:03] <tasaif> I'm not sure
[18:52:26] <tasaif> I think the latter makes the code more coherent, but the prior makes dynamic content a breeze

[20:27:02] <Guest45402> fuck me
[20:27:04] <tw2113> may want to re-try
[20:27:08] <Guest45402> did that
[20:27:14] <tw2113> remove the space at the front, and choose a new pass
[20:30:23] <stephen> well now, that was dumb
[21:11:49] <doug16k> addClass doesn't work on svg elements? seriously?
[21:12:42] <doug16k> hasClass doesn't work either
[21:13:09] <doug16k> manually forcing it to use .classList.add and .classList.contains worked
[21:13:14] <doug16k> on chrome anyway
[21:21:39] <lungaro> I'm a newb and am trying to make sense of a $.ajax request flow. I am issuing a POST and the server returns a 400 error
[21:21:50] <lungaro> yet the "success" function appears to be triggering. Is this normal?
[21:31:03] <doug16k> lungaro, I would avoid using those callbacks that are properties of the passed object. instead, use .then(function(response) { ... success handler ... }, function(xhr) { ... error ... })   style
[21:31:23] <doug16k> just omit success etc and use the promise it returns
[21:31:32] <lungaro> I'm just doing a simple $.ajax() call, that's all I want
[21:31:39] <doug16k> get?
[21:31:47] <lungaro> POST
[21:32:11] <lungaro> I just dont get why success is being called for a HTTP 400 error. Does 2xx, 3xx mean nothing to the libary?
[21:32:26] <doug16k> ok, probably $.post('/my/path', { some: 'data' }).then(function(response) { ... success })   will do it
[21:32:52] <lungaro> well i'm only concerned about the error condition right now. success path works
[21:33:05] <doug16k> 300 arent errors
[21:33:09] <doug16k> 3xx
[21:33:12] <lungaro> 400 is
[21:33:26] <lungaro> 500 is
[21:33:33] <lungaro> i'll figure it out
[21:33:52] <doug16k> dont use those clunky properties, use the promise
[21:34:02] <doug16k> $.ajax and friends return a promise
[21:36:01] <doug16k> lungaro, you really checked the actual response code in the browser debugger network tab?
[21:36:20] <doug16k> i.e. you dont believe the content and assume it really returned that status, right?
[21:36:54] <doug16k> the content text might say it was 400 but not actually return 400
[21:37:35] <doug16k> that would explain mysterious success callbacks
[21:56:36] <dw1> can i set async to false with $.get or $.post?
[22:26:06] <doug16k> dw1, never do that
[22:26:10] <doug16k> ever
[22:27:05] <doug16k> it is easy to make anything async in js
[22:28:02] <doug16k> dw1, async false is complete total crap
[22:29:23] <doug16k> you can usually take sync code and move the location of the handler a tiny bit and put it in a .then callback and it works async while looks and feels sync in the code
[22:30:18] <doug16k> any caller that you think needs the answer right away gets the promise right away, then their .then handler looks and feels sync
[22:30:23] <doug16k> but runs async
[22:30:44] <doug16k> dw1,  show me the code
[22:32:03] <doug16k> I hope all sync xhr's will just throw an exception someday soon
[22:32:25] <doug16k> it is just too easy not to use sync
[23:02:52] <crillegustafsson> Hi, someone worked with jSignature? --> https://github.com/brinley/jSignature/
[23:09:21] <toomus> Hi. I have div with oveflow: scroll; How to disable page scrolling, when scrolling div?
[23:26:25] <quackgyver> Why doesn't toggle() work when .css() is appended to it?
[23:27:16] <Cork> quackgyver: are you talking about toggle with a duration?
[23:28:10] <quackgyver> Cork: No I'm talking about toggle() with css appended to it that gives it display bock
[23:28:39] <Woet> quackgyver: www.jsfiddle.net
[23:28:41] <Cork> ?paste @ quackgyver
[23:29:09] <Cork> stupid bot...
[23:29:35] <quackgyver> Woet: Why on earthy would you ask for a code example for a general rule that remains true on its own
[23:29:48] <Woet> quackgyver: because you're being vague.
[23:30:04] <Cork> ya
[23:30:15] <quackgyver> Nope. Pretty clear question. .toggle().css("display", "block");
[23:30:35] <Cork> quackgyver: and what direction is that toggle?
[23:30:59] <Cork> so again, make a fiddle
[23:31:31] <quackgyver> direction?
[23:31:37] <Woet> quackgyver: http://jsfiddle.net/gt01Lmmc/
[23:31:39] <Woet> works fine here.
[23:32:04] <quackgyver> Woet: doesn't work for me
[23:32:11] <Woet> quackgyver: define "does not work".
[23:32:19] <quackgyver> The second click doesn't hide it again.
[23:32:22] <Woet> ...
[23:32:28] <Woet> you're forcing it to be display block with your .css call
[23:32:30] <Woet> what else do you expect?
[23:32:41] <quackgyver> I expect it to hide again like it would without the css appended
[23:32:45] <Woet> ....
[23:32:53] <Woet> it is hiding again
[23:32:53] <Cork> quackgyver: hide == display: none
[23:33:00] <Woet> and then you're forcing it to be visible
[23:33:03] <Woet> with your display block call
[23:33:04] <Cork> quackgyver: so display: block == force it to always show
[23:33:31] <quackgyver> So it doesn't know to remove the block attribute with toggle?
[23:33:43] <Woet> are you trolling?
[23:33:51] <Cork> quackgyver: you could do .css('display: block').toggle()
[23:33:53] <Woet> you are forcing display block /after/ the toggle
[23:33:55] <Cork> but that would always hide it
[23:34:11] <Cork> cause its starting point would always be visible
[23:34:12] <Woet> surely this can't be confusing you
[23:34:13] <quackgyver> Woet you sound like a total nerd douche. I get that you're probably some kind of jQuery wizard but that doesn't mean that everybody are.
[23:34:19] <quackgyver> Geez man.
[23:34:35] <quackgyver> Woet = Comic Book Guy.
[23:34:40] <Woet> i assume that means yes, you are trolling
[23:34:41] <Woet> got it
[23:34:42] <Cork> quackgyver: .toggle() is .show() combined with .hide()
[23:34:46] <quackgyver> Woet: ignored.
[23:34:57] <Cork> quackgyver: .toggle pickes what command to call based on the display value
[23:35:11] <quackgyver> Cork: Ah got it.
[23:35:13] <Cork> quackgyver: .show() === css('display', '')
[23:35:22] <quackgyver> I'll do that instead. Thanks a lot. :)
[23:35:30] <Cork> quackgyver: hide() === .css('display', 'none')
[23:35:31] <Woet> always funny when people ignore you because they're incompetent
[23:35:51] <Cork> quackgyver: so setting display: block after the toggle call makes the .toggle() call completely useless
[23:36:05] <quackgyver> Yeah I understand now.
[23:36:09] <quackgyver> Thanks mate.
[23:36:52] <Uhkis> this Woet :-)
[23:36:59] <quackgyver> Is he still going on
[23:37:05] <quackgyver> o_o
[23:37:25] <Cork> quackgyver: he was helping you so you where quite rude
[23:37:35] <crillegustafsson> http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-to-image/
[23:37:37] <Cork> quackgyver: he just didn't manage to get you to understand the problem
[23:37:52] <Woet> hi Uhkis ༼∵༽
[23:37:56] <crillegustafsson> does anyone understand it would be so NICE =)
[23:38:08] <quackgyver> Cork: You're blind if you couldn't pick up on his snarky undertone pal.
[23:38:18] <quackgyver> He was just being a classic Freenode douche.
[23:38:22] <Uhkis> Woet: such utf boxes!
[23:38:33] <quackgyver> Anyway it worked, so thanks.
[23:38:43] <Woet> Uhkis: i can't find our usual greeting
[23:38:47] <Uhkis> quackgyver: believe me, he's a douche on every network :D
[23:38:57] <Woet> Uhkis pls
[23:38:58] <crillegustafsson> Got a problem! who wanna dig in ?
[23:39:01] <quackgyver> :3
[23:39:17] <Woet> crillegustafsson: are you gonna ask your actual question
[23:39:23] <Cork> quackgyver: well when ppl ask 101 questions and fail to understand the explanations ppl tend to be a bit snarky
[23:39:35] <Woet> instead of linking a random PHP library?
[23:39:57] <Cork> Woet: tone down the hostility
[23:40:03] <crillegustafsson> Woet : yeahs, Im trying to save a signature to image. And I dont really know how to do
[23:40:16] <Woet> crillegustafsson: are you having trouble with the jQuery part or the PHP part?
[23:40:16] <crillegustafsson> Woet : being reading this for a while http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-to-image/
[23:40:29] <quackgyver> Cork: That's totally idiotic and only serve to make douchey nerds feel better about themselves. I sure as heck don't behave like that towrad 101 people in areas where I'm senior.
[23:40:37] <quackgyver> toward*
[23:41:03] <Cork> quackgyver: no, when ppl ask questions in a channel they are expected to have learned the basic of web development
[23:41:12] <quackgyver> I disagree.
[23:41:25] <crillegustafsson> Woet : have tried this to --> http://willowsystems.github.io/jSignature/#/demo/
[23:41:25] <Cork> well then expect to get snarky responses
[23:41:40] <quackgyver> I just ignore snarky responses. :3
[23:41:43] <crillegustafsson> Woet : but that is not saving anything.. just getting a lot of codes
[23:42:04] <Woet> crillegustafsson: you're being quite vague. what is your actual problem?
[23:43:36] <crillegustafsson> Woet : I got a document with info , like an invoice.. and when I hit OK everything puts on a PDF file
[23:44:08] <crillegustafsson> Woet : now I want to add a signature also before I hit OK so the signature will be creating to that PDF file also
[23:44:37] <crillegustafsson> Woet : In the end I got a invoice with a signature
[23:44:52] <crillegustafsson> Woet : this is also none buisiness project.. school project
[23:45:24] <Woet> crillegustafsson: okay, so what part are you stuck at?
[23:45:47] <Woet> crillegustafsson: you need to add the jQuery code on your website, capture their signature, then send the resulting json/base64 to your backend code so it can turn that into an image and put it in your PDF
[23:46:19] <crillegustafsson> Woet : yeah.. that exacly this info I need, but how to do that is my big problem
[23:47:01] <crillegustafsson> that thing you said I want to do, but right now I need some guide or help to get it right
[23:47:22] <Woet> crillegustafsson: read into their docs and go for it.
[23:48:02] <Woet> and then ask here if anything comes up
[23:48:03] <crillegustafsson> Woet : yes, there is another problem. they have none guide
[23:48:23] <Woet> crillegustafsson: http://willowsystems.github.io/jSignature/#/about/
[23:48:31] <Woet> has everything right there.
[23:48:37] <crillegustafsson> there is like info about script you CAN use, but now HOW to use it
[23:48:45] <Woet> it covers both.
[23:49:23] <crillegustafsson> if it covers both for you, how do you understand it ?
[23:49:34] <toomus> How to prevent document body scoll, when scrollig overflow div?
[23:49:38] <crillegustafsson> cause Im reading it :P
[23:49:45] <Woet> crillegustafsson: seriously, all you have to do is copy/paste the code they have right there.
[23:50:13] <crillegustafsson> Woet : Usages Examples ?
[23:50:53] <Woet> toomus: http://jsfiddle.net/2rLL4a3f/1/
[23:51:06] <Woet> toomus: shouldn't need to code anything, it that by default
[23:51:46] <toomus> Nope, this doesn't work on my MacBook Pro
[23:52:03] <crillegustafsson> Woet : u ment usages examples ?
[23:52:09] <crillegustafsson> cause its a code there
[23:52:13] <Woet> toomus: just return false on document scroll
[23:52:19] <crillegustafsson> but if I copy that, where to paste it ?
[23:52:32] <Woet> crillegustafsson: you're gonna have to put some more effort into this.
[23:52:37] <Woet> crillegustafsson: i'm not doing your school project for you.
[23:52:55] <Woet> crillegustafsson: if you have a basic question like "where to paste it" you're gonna have to ask your teacher or resort to your school documentation
[23:53:00] <toomus> Woet: I know, that I can set overflow: hidden to body on mosueover my div, but this make scrollbars to hide :/
[23:53:05] <crillegustafsson> Woet : you not, u just helping me to understand
[23:53:13] <Woet> toomus: that's not the same as return false.
[23:53:18] <Woet> crillegustafsson: this is the best i can do.
[23:53:52] <toomus> Woet: which event should return false?
[23:53:59] <Woet> toomus: document scroll.
[23:54:04] <crillegustafsson> Woet : ok, but if I download the project I just get php files and js files
[23:54:15] <Woet> crillegustafsson: correct.
[23:54:18] <crillegustafsson> Woet : there is no html/php file for template
[23:54:27] <Woet> crillegustafsson: there is no need. their documentation covers it.
[23:54:29] <crillegustafsson> I cant see the project
[23:55:29] <crillegustafsson> yes, they only say to code canvas
[23:55:54] <crillegustafsson> it should be like <canvas id="signature"></canvas>
[23:56:16] <Woet> crillegustafsson: that sounds about right.
[23:56:43] <crillegustafsson> woet : ok
[23:56:50] <crillegustafsson> but step 2 says : Code that handles actual signature capture + data import / export API.
[23:56:59] <Woet> crillegustafsson: maybe you should finish step 1 first.
[23:57:00] <crillegustafsson> whats that, ?
[23:57:09] <crillegustafsson> ok, is it more
[23:57:10] <Woet> crillegustafsson: like I told you. "then send the resulting json/base64 to your backend code so it can turn that into an image and put it in your PDF"
[23:57:10] <crillegustafsson> :P
[23:57:20] <Woet> can you draw your signature already?
[23:57:49] <toomus> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/2rLL4a3f/2/ still doesn't work
[23:57:51] <crillegustafsson> Woet: step1 is canvas and import FlashCanvas ?
[23:58:03] <Woet> crillegustafsson: again, you're gonna have to put some more effort in.
[23:58:16] <Woet> toomus: check the console.
[23:58:22] <crillegustafsson> Woet : how do you know that ?
[23:58:41] <crillegustafsson> cause its not saying more than that In step 1
[23:58:42] <Woet> crillegustafsson: because I told you to finish step 1 less than 2 minutes ago.
[23:59:04] <Woet> crillegustafsson: trying for less than 2 minutes and then asking more does not mean you put a lot of effort in.
[23:59:42] <crillegustafsson> hmm.. its not easy I tell you :P
[23:59:53] <Woet> crillegustafsson: if it was then anyone would do it.
