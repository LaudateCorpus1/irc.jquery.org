[00:00:17] <lindylex> How can I get Jquery to find the dynamically loaded divs?
[00:01:31] <systemfault> The same way as normal ones.
[00:01:58] <lindylex> It does not see them.
[00:02:09] <lindylex> Here is the code http://pastebin.com/06PiFtA8
[00:03:07] <systemfault> What am I looking at?
[00:05:09] <lindylex> This loads a text file and dynamically build a string with divs with a class name class="quotes".  I want to fade these every two second.
[00:05:31] <lindylex> It work when written in the html.  Not when i load it dynamically.
[00:06:05] <lindylex> I tried $('#randomQuotes').html( myTextOfQuotes ); That did not work.
[00:06:37] <lindylex> I tried document.getElementById("randomQuotes").innerHTML = '<div class="quotes"> First quote </div><div class="quotes"> Second quote </div>';  hat did not work either.
[00:47:37] <lindylex> I got it to work.  Thanks
[01:43:48] <Yepp> i can't filter many times. it'll return the object the first time, but the second time it's not being returned anymore. why?
[01:54:50] <arc_> Yepp need to see your code
[01:55:48] <Yepp> arc_ http://kopy.io/pJGXZ#7pNTaEeiuOT9dz
[01:55:54] <Yepp> also it is a bit slow I think
[01:56:18] <arc_> what is
[01:56:22] <Yepp> when I opened the modal with form, there are some times that it shows empty and values just magically appear
[01:57:02] <Yepp> filter on line 17,18,22,23
[01:57:33] <arc_> i don't see where you're trying to filter twice
[01:57:35] <Yepp> console log will show the object on first filter, then the next time it is not there anymore
[01:57:51] <arc_> this sounds like something not related to filter
[01:58:03] <Yepp> it is inside a loop
[01:58:10] <Yepp> it is also a radio button
[01:58:18] <arc_> what is happening on click
[01:58:44] <Yepp> it'll just add a active class on the label
[01:58:58] <arc_> so no elements are being changed
[01:59:05] <Yepp> none
[01:59:21] <arc_> do you not have control over the html
[01:59:26] <Yepp> on the loop, i catch the inputs by their input name
[01:59:45] <Yepp> i have 2 radio button which obviously have same name
[01:59:58] <Yepp> so the filter is being executed twice
[02:00:07] <Yepp> the first call the object returns it
[02:00:16] <Yepp> the next time it is not being returned
[02:00:22] <Yepp> but instead it returns....
[02:00:49] <Yepp> [prevObject: n.fn.init[0], context: input]
[02:01:02] <Yepp> first time: [label#btn-female.ui.inverted.pink.button.active, prevObject: n.fn.init[1], context: input]
[02:01:26] <arc_> i really don't think that has anything to do with filter
[02:01:39] <Yepp> hmm, what is then?
[02:01:47] <arc_> why can't you select it by perhaps #btn-female instead of by [value="female"]
[02:03:01] <Yepp> lemme try. that makes sense. I don't remember why did i even use fitler
[02:03:03] <Yepp> filter
[02:03:22] <arc_> like, this whole thing makes it seem like there are multiple forms on the page, but the buttons have ids, which are required to be unique
[02:04:59] <arc_> you are basing all of your selectors on $(element) as if you need to select relative to an input, but at the same time it seems like this is probably going to be a single static form
[02:05:54] <Yepp> yep it works. but I wonder what happened there? using filter there is legal to me. Might need in on some cases
[02:06:24] <arc_> i don't know. maybe the value is changing for some reason. i can't really say without being able to see the html
[02:06:59] <Yepp> here: http://kopy.io/PNq2P#3SDLOrcmBpLPOC
[02:07:04] <arc_> or better yet being able to see a working example
[02:08:06] <arc_> idk, i mean i have no problem filtering multiple times https://jsfiddle.net/8og3re9f/
[02:15:14] <Yepp> arc_ https://jsfiddle.net/ ?
[02:15:16] <Yepp> oops
[02:15:30] <Yepp> arc_ https://jsfiddle.net/4r90g5zg/
[02:17:24] <Yepp> have you looked at it?
[02:17:31] <arc_> Yepp i'm not sure what you're showing me here
[02:17:47] <Yepp> i expect it to return:
[02:17:54] <Yepp> [input#male, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1]] [input#female, prevObject: jQuery.fn.init[1]] two times
[02:18:10] <Yepp> since two console.log is there on each loop
[02:18:17] <arc_> it doesn't return that either time for me
[02:18:24] <arc_> it returns the same thing both times
[02:18:40] <Yepp> here's the result on my console
[02:18:58] <Yepp> http://kopy.io/WO7b5#4AFno5xV9vXUeo
[02:21:08] <arc_> yeah so it returns the same thing both times, just in reverse order for some reason
[02:21:48] <Yepp> why is that? is the filter not working there? should return both of them two times
[02:21:52] <Yepp> since I filter them out
[02:22:26] <arc_> no, this is an each
[02:22:38] <arc_> so what is $(element)
[02:22:53] <arc_> $(element) is one of those radio buttons
[02:22:57] <Yepp> yes
[02:23:07] <arc_> so you filter ONE button by its own value
[02:23:24] <arc_> so obviously it selects itself, as the only element in the jquery object
[02:23:37] <arc_> then you try to filter it by a value that doesn't exist
[02:24:55] <arc_> do console.log($(element).length); it should be 1
[02:25:02] <arc_> so you're filtering from a list of 1 thing
[02:25:10] <Yepp> ah, i did not thought of that
[02:25:35] <Yepp> although i got it working now, i even got the explanation i wanted
[02:25:38] <Yepp> thanks arc_
[02:25:41] <arc_> np
[02:46:13] <jaggz> Why am I getting some weird bracket's in my output?
[02:46:17] <jaggz> not sure if you all see it: https://jsfiddle.net/43eoan3q/2/
[02:49:25] <jaggz> updated one refers to google's jquery (I don't see an option on jsfiddle for it.. thought it used to be there)..

[02:49:29] <jaggz> doesn't make a difference though
[03:18:19] <JosefDe> Hi gus.
[03:18:42] <JosefDe> Why is Chocolat.js continously creating new <div>'s for the same image-selector?
[03:29:46] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[03:40:04] <JosefDe> I have a question:
[04:02:18] <SuperSeriousCat> Any easy way to make every .oneTo be infront of .oneFrom? Same with twoTo etc etc. Dont know anything about scripting https://jsfiddle.net/2vgky3qb/2/
[04:16:47] <SuperSeriousCat> Fixed it. Any tips on how to clean up the code? It look like alot of code and classes for little work https://jsfiddle.net/2vgky3qb/3/
[05:58:07] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[05:59:46] <JosefDe> Hi guys
[06:00:00] <JosefDe> Can someone please explain me why a second function() is defined inside the function?: https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2850/
[06:07:37] <daslicht> I already searched with google, anyone knows a standalone jquery plugin which lets clients build visually grids like in this wordpress theme ?:
[06:07:47] <daslicht> http://laytheme.com
[06:07:49] <daslicht> ?
[06:08:38] <JosefDe> I came first wait in the question-queue :)
[06:08:45] <daslicht> haha
[06:08:47] <JosefDe> Guys please answer "daslicht"'s question after mine :)
[06:09:00] <JosefDe> daslicht: Scherze nur ;)
[06:09:09] <daslicht> joah
[06:09:15] <daslicht> do you know an answer to mine ?
[06:09:30] <daslicht> JosefDe: what is your questiion ?
[06:09:52] <JosefDe> daslicht: Can you please explain me why a second function() is defined inside the function?: https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2850/
[06:10:06] <JosefDe> daslicht: That's "document.ready()" right?
[06:10:54] <daslicht> hm
[06:11:01] <JosefDe> The problem is: I'm including a library called "Chocolat". Inside that "$(function())" that library is not available, why?
[06:11:02] <daslicht> you dont need the second
[06:11:55] <JosefDe> Of course I need it because it's waiting until document.ready is triggered
[06:13:03] <daslicht> "document.ready() triggers
[06:13:15] <daslicht> and run all thing inside it after the doc is ready
[06:13:41] <JosefDe> correct. But why is my library "Chocolat" not available inside "$(function())"?
[06:14:03] <daslicht> hard to tell without actuall code :)
[06:14:04] <daslicht> Chocolat js
[06:14:09] <daslicht> http://chocolat.insipi.de
[06:14:11] <daslicht> this?
[06:14:17] <JosefDe> correct
[06:14:25] <JosefDe> daslicht: I've commented in my code where it is available and where not: https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2851/
[06:15:33] <daslicht> add it to the fiddle
[06:15:47] <JosefDe> ok. Wait a second
[06:16:46] <daslicht> joah
[06:16:48] <daslicht> :)
[06:19:24] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/o0dn1urs/1/
[06:20:42] <JosefDe> wait
[06:20:55] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/bygm28jy/
[06:21:04] <daslicht> here with you additional funktion
[06:21:07] <daslicht> both working
[06:28:25] <JosefDe> daslicht: https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2868/
[06:28:37] <daslicht> seen my ?
[06:29:02] <JosefDe> daslicht: Yes. But your's is different than my usecase
[06:29:09] <JosefDe> It doesn't reflect my code
[06:29:13] <daslicht> ok
[06:29:23] <daslicht> you example shows nothing ?
[06:29:40] <JosefDe> daslicht: If you look into the console you see the error message that "search" is no constructor
[06:29:49] <daslicht> ok let me see
[06:33:21] <daslicht> hm thats not really about choclat related
[06:33:24] <daslicht> its more about js
[06:35:19] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/xsuem5s6/
[06:35:58] <daslicht> you nbever assigned this.initChocolat
[06:36:08] <daslicht> hm no idea
[06:37:49] <JosefDe> daslicht: Locally I get the error that "$(..).Chocolat()" doesn't exist
[06:46:50] <JosefDe> can anyone help me please?
[06:48:03] <drej> chocolate doesnt exist?? what is this world coming to?
[06:48:49] <JosefDe> It exists. But I've the following situation:
[06:49:16] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2851/
[06:49:39] <JosefDe> There I get "$(...).Chocolat()" does not exist error when I do use Chocolat in the inner function
[06:49:42] <JosefDe> But when I do this:
[06:49:58] <JosefDe> https://jsfiddle.net/wx38rz5L/2874/
[06:50:06] <JosefDe> When I directly execute the inner function, it works
[06:50:07] <JosefDe> Why?
[06:51:21] <JosefDe> So if I wait for document.ready it doesn't work
[06:51:33] <JosefDe> (Chocolat.js) is then not available
[06:53:59] <JosefDe> has anyone an idea?
[06:55:46] <daslicht> it is available afer dom ready , proof is my fiddle
[06:58:21] <JosefDe> But why doesn't it work locally? Chocolat is available in the outer function but not in the inner document.ready-function
[07:02:28] <daslicht> why do you need that inner annonymous self executing function at all ?
[07:03:49] <JosefDe> daslicht: It stands for "document.ready" which waits for all html-elements ot be loaded
[07:04:04] <JosefDe> But for some reason the Chocolat-library is not available inside the document.ready-function. The question is why?
[07:04:33] <daslicht> without seeing the whole code it will be hard that anyone be able to help
[07:04:54] <daslicht> https://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/bygm28jy/2/
[07:05:03] <daslicht> so that doesnt work for you locally ?
[07:05:38] <JosefDe> Correct. But I'm using Chocolat inside a seperate-class of a seperate file
[07:06:18] <JosefDe> And that seems to have a different scope
[07:06:31] <daslicht> :)
[07:06:48] <daslicht> class ?
[07:06:56] <daslicht> there are no Classes in JS :)
[07:07:09] <JosefDe> daslicht: I mean function
[07:07:11] <daslicht> :)
[07:07:17] <daslicht> i know :)
[07:13:40] <daslicht> bbl
[07:13:44] <daslicht> hav fun :)

[07:32:36] <codecutter> I need to change this to insertBefore instead of append: $(htmlTemplate).find('.more').append(aComment);
[07:36:14] <codecutter> nvm
[07:58:26] <hamdjan> hi how do i get the value of edit-input within tooltipster functionReady? I tried: http://fiddle.jshell.net/UxND3/210/
[08:00:04] <hamdjan> (i get undefined, though i put something into the input field)
[08:06:57] <codecutter> is there a more succinct way of writing this? $(e.currentTarget).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().find('.comment').toggleClass('hidden')
[08:25:37] <hamdjan> codecutter, prev()?
[08:25:52] <codecutter> how do i use it?
[08:26:22] <hamdjan> try  $(e.currentTarget).prev('.comment')...
[08:28:40] <codecutter> hamdjan: not seem to be working
[08:28:50] <codecutter> $(e.currentTarget).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().find('.comment') <-- this works
[08:29:34] <codecutter> $(e.currentTarget).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().find('.comment').toggleClass('hidden'); <--- this works
[08:29:45] <codecutter> hamdjan: ^^
[08:30:18] <hamdjan> ok
[08:30:59] <hamdjan> maybe try to find a parent tag like $(e.currentTarget).prev("some_parent_tag").find(".comment")
[08:34:21] <codecutter> this don't work either console.log($(e.currentTarget).prev('.post'));
[08:34:30] <shoky> codecutter:  use .closest(selector)  instead of all those .parent()
[08:35:15] <codecutter> shoky: you mean $(e.currentTarget).closest().find('.comment').toggleClass('hidden');
[08:35:32] <shoky> no.  find the parent using some selector like a class name
[08:35:43] <shoky> .closest('.someclass').find('.comment') ..
[08:36:08] <shoky> some class that the top parent you want has
[08:36:55] <codecutter> this works $(e.currentTarget).parent().closest('li').find('.comment').toggleClass('hidden');
[08:37:11] <codecutter> can i shorten it further?
[08:37:15] <shoky> give that <li> a class
[08:37:26] <shoky> make it descriptive
[08:37:32] <codecutter> besides that?
[08:37:44] <shoky> then you dont need the .parent()  and you do .closest('.classname')
[08:38:05] <shoky> and uh usually you can use `this` instead of e.currentTarget
[08:38:18] <codecutter> not in this case
[08:38:21] <shoky> oks
[08:38:36] <codecutter> framework owns 'this'
[08:38:45] <codecutter> alas
[09:39:35] <codecutter> I'm trying to to remove a data attr from a string then return the string, i this will return node,  $(originalHtmlString).removeData('id')
[09:39:48] <codecutter> i think*
[10:01:22] <shoky> removeAttr is for removing attrs.  you can try $(originalHtml).removeAttr('data-id').prop('outerHTML')
[10:22:11] <codecutter> shoky: how do I prevent a cursor from going to a new line when there is no text in textarea?
[10:22:45] <decx> catch keydown 13 and compare it against value length
[10:23:12] <decx> makes more sense to just trim your textarea tho
[10:23:57] <codecutter> what do you mean trim?
[10:24:08] <codecutter> i mean if the textarea is empty
[10:24:15] <codecutter> i mean when the textarea is empty
[10:32:14] <codecutter> http://pastebin.com/cqg5yTbW
[10:34:29] <codecutter> decx: ^^
[10:34:50] <codecutter> stop cursor from going to new line only when there is no text
[10:35:52] <codecutter> at present when the cursor is on textarea, event when there is no text, when return is pressed it goes to new line
[10:36:01] <codecutter> even*
[10:37:21] <decx> i dont know what this.select is supposed to be
[10:37:52] <codecutter> think this.select as $('.foo')
[10:37:56] <codecutter> think of*
[10:38:17] <codecutter> its a selector
[10:38:26] <decx> why isnt the event on the textarea or delegated from it
[10:38:48] <codecutter> event comes from the parameter
[10:38:57] <decx> no
[10:39:09] <decx> that doesnt answer what i asked
[10:39:31] <codecutter> this.on('keyup', { textArea : this.uiHandleCounter } );
[10:39:43] <decx> wat
[10:40:00] <codecutter> this.uiHandleCounter = function(event)....
[10:41:01] <codecutter> this.on('keyup', { textArea : this.uiHandleCounter } ); <-- this line attached s 'keyup' eventlistenr to the textarea
[10:41:10] <codecutter> attaches*
[10:47:19] <codecutter> nvm
[10:48:06] <vmonteco> Hello!
[10:52:32] <vmonteco> I have a question, if I have a $("#id").click(f) in my code, but my code also replaces the $("#id") element with another element with id="id", will f still apply if I click on $("#id")?
[10:53:10] <vmonteco> Or do I have to "reload" my $("#id").click(f)?
[10:56:50] <ia9371> thereoritically if i was trying to add javascript fade into a nav bar would i use jquery or javascript?
[10:57:05] <ia9371> like hover effects on on click effects
[11:10:47] <vmonteco> $(parent).on(event, child, f) <-- does that mean  (A) "Apply f on child in parent when event occures on parent" or (B) "Apply f on child in parent when event occures on child"?
[11:13:32] <shoky> vmonteco: more like B i guess.  it means:  add an event listener on parent, that listens for events that bubbled up from the child.  i.e. the event originally triggered on the child, and it bubbles up to trigger on the parent
[11:15:23] <shoky> but the child doesn't have to exist yet when you run that, because you're only adding an event listener on the parent, not on the child
[11:17:30] <vmonteco> shoky: I added something like $(document).on('click', $("#logout"), f) but f is triggered even if the $("#logout") element doens't exist yet when I click on the page. :S I don't really understand why.
[11:17:51] <shoky> vmonteco:  the "child" in .on  has to be a selector, not an element/jquery object
[11:17:57] <vmonteco> I use AJAX to create the $("#logout") button (Or at least I try)
[11:18:26] <vmonteco> shoky: Oh! So I should use "#logout" instead of $("#logout")?
[11:18:34] <shoky> ya
[11:18:51] * vmonteco tries
[11:19:33] <vmonteco> shoky: It works much better! :)
[11:19:40] <vmonteco> Thank you very much. ^^
[11:19:45] <shoky> sweet
[11:28:16] <neuro_sys> $('img#my-image').on('load', function () { alert(); }); doesn't get called in jquery 3.0, what might be the problem?
[11:30:01] <neuro_sys> https://jsfiddle.net/8qdtxnjs/
[11:31:11] <decx> fiddle executes on load by default
[11:31:17] <decx> so your img already had its load event
[11:32:40] <neuro_sys> decx: ah, my code runs not in jsfiddle but the same behaviour, so you mean there's something previously that catches the load event for the element?
[11:33:43] <decx> no, it's just already happend
[11:33:44] <neuro_sys> decx: ah, I realize I listen for the event inside $(document).ready
[11:34:00] <decx> that's before img send load
[11:35:01] <neuro_sys> decx: I understand. the reason I needed to use load event for img was even inside $(document).ready() I couldn't read the clientWidth/Height of the image element.
[11:35:35] <decx> usual async caveats would apply
[11:35:36] <neuro_sys> So I thought I should possibly wait for the load event, but now it turns out it's already loaded.
[11:36:55] <neuro_sys> I don't see what specific async caveat apply in this case.
[11:37:35] <decx> well if you wait for img load in dom ready then you might as well wait for window load to init whatever function would need dimensions
[11:38:35] <neuro_sys> I was waiting for document to be ready, so I should wait for the window to load? i.e. $(window).on('load', fn);
[11:39:05] <decx> depends on the rest of your approach and architecture
[11:39:38] <neuro_sys> oh indeed, inside window's load event I can read image's width and height.

[14:48:56] <D-rex> https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/   search for localization it shows the examples
[15:04:18] <dk0r> Any suggestions on how to convert line-11 (from jquery) to line-14 (javascript) ?
[15:04:21] <dk0r> http://codepen.io/dk0r/pen/BLyjbR?editors=1011
[15:11:21] <D-rex> Technically they're both javascript but in pure javascript it would be ... tb = document.getElementById("thumbs");
[15:14:02] <dk0r> D-rex, uh..
[15:15:46] <dk0r> 1) Your suggestion did not work. any reason to avoid querySelector()?
[15:15:53] <dk0r> 2) Is that ... a spread operator?
[15:16:00] <dk0r> 3) Technically jquery is a library, not actual javascript
[15:17:47] <Aljone> D-rex: what about localization + call back?
[19:11:07] <plamb_> when you do
[19:11:24] <plamb_> el.on('click'), '#el2', function ....
[19:11:35] <plamb_> does '#el2' have to be a child of el
[19:11:40] <plamb_> or a next sibling
[19:11:58] <plamb_> im currently doing it where el2 is the preceeding sibling and it doesnt seem to be selecting
[19:12:10] <plamb_> el.on('click', #el2 ...
[19:12:11] <plamb_> sorry
[19:27:24] <dviola> hi
[19:27:48] <dviola> I need to do an $.ajax() call but the url will be something like this: /api/objects/track/6e7159c4-e745-4fd3-bd3e-f2c11a27af38.gpx
[19:27:58] <dviola> how can I pass in the id dynamically
[19:28:01] <dviola> without having to do:
[19:28:22] <dviola> $.ajax({ url: "})
[19:28:44] <dviola> $.ajax({ url: "/api/objects/track/" + foo_id + ".gpx" })
[19:28:46] <dviola> ?
[19:31:32] <dviola> nvm, that actually works
[22:19:41] <Cypris> I feel like i should be asking this in jQuery UI's dev channel because its not really a coding question but i'll ask it here too: With jq-ui's draggable stop & droppable drop, can someone please tell me why drop fires before stop?
[22:45:47] <Cypris> Thanks for your answer. It was quick and accurate.
[22:47:03] <arc_> lol what the hell
[22:51:14] <Robdgreat> he should demand a refund for poor service
