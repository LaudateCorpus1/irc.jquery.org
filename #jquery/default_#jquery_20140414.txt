[00:45:46] <karsten_> why my variables in a .each() are not unique?

[01:32:43] <DevAntoine> hi
[01:34:05] <DevAntoine> I'm getting the width of an element using el.width(), which returns me the correct value, but when explicitly setting the width doing el.width(el.width()) the set width is wider than the original. It includes the element's padding oO
[01:35:30] <Cork> DevAntoine: make a jsfiddle of the problem
[01:42:38] <DansVC> Hi
[01:44:10] <DansVC> Someone can help me?
[01:44:36] <Cork> DansVC: not until you ask a question
[01:44:50] <DansVC> Is just to know if someone is here
[01:45:17] <Cork> DansVC: just ask the question and you'll know
[01:45:45] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/YkrWL/2/ I have this code that print the moves of the mouse on a SVG
[01:46:05] <DansVC> but in Firefox it don't happens right like in Chrome
[01:46:21] <DansVC> Is a little out of the mouseposition
[01:46:46] <DansVC> And happend a extra point in the top left side of the SVG
[01:50:28] <Cork> DansVC: http://jsfiddle.net/YkrWL/3/
[01:51:25] <DansVC> wht you do?
[01:51:56] <Cork> i remove the code offsetting clientX with the elements position in relation to the document
[01:53:33] <DansVC> oh
[01:53:49] <Cork> you might want to use pageX instead of client though
[01:53:49] <DansVC> but why this happens?
[01:54:21] <DansVC> the $(this).position() dont should return 0?
[01:54:25] <Cork> DansVC: clientY gives you the offset including the toolbars in the browser
[01:54:28] <Cork> no
[01:54:45] <Cork> hmm wait a min
[01:54:52] <DansVC> thx Cork
[01:55:02] <Cork> also define your variables...
[01:55:35] <DansVC> This is a short of my code
[01:57:12] <DansVC> instead of using that if(e.type ...) I can make this: XX = e.pageX || e.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX ??
[01:59:18] <Cork> DansVC: this looks like a firefox bug actually
[01:59:33] <DansVC> oh
[02:00:01] <Cork> DansVC: try inspecting the svg element in firefox
[02:01:01] <Cork> 0x0 has an additional offset of ~100x100
[02:01:54] <DataAintEasy> Guys why does this line returns type error $('.d1').datepicker({autoclose: true}).datapick('setValue','04/05/2014'); ?
[02:02:40] <Cork> DataAintEasy: what is the error
[02:03:20] <DataAintEasy> undefined is not a function
[02:03:31] <DevAntoine> Cork: I can't reproduce the use case oO
[02:03:49] <Cork> DataAintEasy: do you mean datapicker instead of datapick?
[02:04:15] <Cork> DevAntoine: so it most likely is something else causing it
[02:04:56] <DataAintEasy> Cork: actually i meant datepick instead of datapick =)
[02:05:43] <DataAintEasy> hmm still getting error
[02:08:04] <DansVC> thx Cork
[02:10:59] <teitoklein01> hi guys, i have a problem hiding my custom popup element. I would want to achieve a hide() action whenever the user clicks anywhere on the map but not on the elements and it's child
[02:11:31] <teitoklein01> $('html').click() -- it seems that it also hides the element whenever I click inside my popover
[02:11:49] <Cork> teitoklein01: you need to check event.target
[02:12:10] <Cork> and if it is the element or a child of the element you want to exclude you don't do the close
[02:12:41] <teitoklein01> ohh. i'll read it first. it seems new to me
[02:13:08] <Cork> teitoklein01: events bubble, so if you click a child
[02:13:23] <Cork> it fires the handlers of all the parents
[02:14:20] <teitoklein01> so i'll still use my $('html').click() but I will validate the elements inside my popup to avoid hiding it whenever I click inside?
[02:14:36] <Cork> use $(document) not html
[02:14:44] <teitoklein01> owww
[02:14:54] <teitoklein01> okay. i'll try it first on js fiddle
[02:15:37] <Cork> and the validation is fairly easy just do if($(event.target).closest('.my-dialog').length > 0) { return; }
[02:16:01] <Cork> where .my-dialog is the identify of the outer most element you want to exclude
[02:24:32] <teitoklein01> Cork: thanks man! you're a god
[02:24:33] <teitoklein01> http://jsfiddle.net/
[02:24:53] <Cork> teitoklein01: you need to hit save
[02:24:54] <teitoklein01> http://jsfiddle.net/Ss68Q/
[02:25:01] <teitoklein01> oh forgot . hehe
[02:47:00] <decx> you need to specifiy event for your click function
[02:50:34] <SprkDev> how do we empty a form field with jquery? like after I click a button?
[02:51:37] <DataAintEasy> Guys my datepicker won't post when i set date on it
[02:51:43] <DataAintEasy> what could be the problem
[02:52:09] <teitoklein01> $('#mybutton').click(function(){ $('#field').val(""); });
[02:54:21] <Cork> SprkDev: $('form')[0].reset()
[02:56:03] <computer2000> what flash player should i use for html5 video fallback?
[02:59:56] <SprkDev> thanks
[03:00:15] <SprkDev> #twitterapi
[03:01:22] <SprkDev> anyone know how I can check if twitter account is verified using API?
[03:04:24] <Cork> SprkDev: ask in there developer channel
[03:05:07] <SprkDev> I have but no response. WHat is their developer channel exactly?
[03:06:24] <Cork> SprkDev: i think it's #twidder-dev
[03:07:20] <SprkDev> no one there.
[03:10:04] <SprkDev> I have another question.
[03:10:15] <SprkDev> Hi I have a very simple problem. I am using this plugin to crop images. http://www.croppic.net/. But instead of it being a rectangle I want it to be a box as in 300 x 300 px. I've chaged the style size in css, but it woudn't crop properly.
[03:13:37] <SprkDev> any ideas?
[03:16:43] <SprkDev> its odd, you'd think there would be a number to change, but there aint. Only in the css, but that messes the crop up.
[03:19:41] <BinaryKitten> SprkDev are you using the php example?
[03:40:30] <SprkDev> yes
[03:40:31] <sqlnoob> Anyone has any idea of why simple $('select').change(function() {alert(1);}) would not work with jquery. I'm using 1.10.0
[03:40:40] <skullcrasher> how do i return the js element from an jquery object, so I can use it for e.g. google maps
[03:41:04] <SprkDev> i downloaded the whole thing and used the index file
[03:41:06] <systemfault> skullcrasher: myNode[0] or myNode.get(0)
[03:42:04] <skullcrasher> systemfault: oh nice
[03:42:07] <skullcrasher> worked, thx
[03:42:22] <systemfault> sqlnoob: http://jsfiddle.net/WrA3w/ Works. Something else is wrong in your code.
[03:42:52] <sqlnoob> I placed this code in head of HTML. Is it wrong?
[03:43:41] <teitoklein01> hi guys i would like to ask a question, I have dynamic text fields and I need to make it a datepicker. what should I do to add datepicker functionality to it when it loaded on DOM?
[03:43:42] <systemfault> sqlnoob: Yes, unless you wrapped it inside a $(document).ready(function() { YOURCODEHERE; });
[03:43:52] <sqlnoob> oh yeah systemfault thanks
[03:43:56] <sqlnoob> worked perfectly
[03:44:11] <teitoklein01> I only put the datepicker() on document,ready() and it seems that it doesn't recognized the newly created element
[03:44:49] <systemfault> teitoklein01: Watch the order or creation… make sure that the elements exist when calling the datepicket.
[03:44:51] <systemfault> *picker
[03:45:01] <systemfault> (of creation...)
[03:45:22] <teitoklein01> the datepicker/textfield does not exist in the first place. the textfields are dynamically created on button click
[03:45:31] <teitoklein01> and whenever it loaded I want to make it a datepicker.
[03:46:14] <axilaris> i was wondering if someone can help... im trying to do a dynamic selected for select2 http://jsfiddle.net/bbAU9/228/
[03:46:28] <axilaris> selecting it using this $('#attribute').val(1); doesnt work
[03:46:33] <axilaris> or even this doesnt work
[03:46:37] <axilaris> $('#attribute option:contains("1")').prop('selected', true);
[03:46:47] <axilaris> but if i remove select2, it works
[03:47:24] <sqlnoob> systemfault: is it possible to know a variable based on its name. I mean compare a variable name with the string not the content of variable in javascript/jquery
[03:48:19] <systemfault> sqlnoob: To do what? (Trying to understand)
[03:48:21] <SprkDev> anyone know how to make the plugin that works for a rectangle, work for a square too?
[03:49:03] <systemfault> axilaris: Look at the doc, it’s written.
[03:49:11] <axilaris> trying to find it
[03:49:21] <sqlnoob> I want arrays name to be same as id value fields in options of select. So for eg, if "male" is selected, use male array and like that. I could do a simple comparison but will have to do too many comparisons in my case.
[03:50:16] <systemfault> sqlnoob: You could use an object to map “male” to the array
[03:50:52] <systemfault> sqlnoob: var foo =  { male: [1,2,3], female: [4,5,6]}…
[03:50:59] <axilaris> hmm maybe this  $("#e8").select2("val", "CA");
[03:51:04] <systemfault> axilaris: Yes.
[03:51:08] <sqlnoob> thanks systemfault :)
[03:51:34] <systemfault> sqlnoob: Then you can do foo[theVariable] to get the array
[03:51:40] <systemfault> You’re welcome.
[03:51:44] <axilaris> yup
[03:51:47] <axilaris> got it
[03:56:02] <sp3ck> Hi, i'm trying to get some data (via ajax POST request) from a php file when the user likes a fbpage. here is my code http://pastebin.com/Cg9DXvbA the problem is that console says: 'TypeError: $ is undefined' Is there any way to overcome this?
[03:56:41] <systemfault> You called noConflict...
[03:56:47] <systemfault> Guess what it does.
[03:57:11] <systemfault> Makes jquery not use the $
[03:57:57] <sp3ck> does the same thing even if i dont call noConflict and it does the same thing if i call jQuery.post()
[03:58:26] <systemfault> Then you have not included jQuery on the page before that code is executed
[03:59:04] <sp3ck> unfortunately i did include jquery before
[03:59:19] <systemfault> Then something is really wrong.
[04:01:41] <sp3ck> this is how i call them http://pastebin.com/fiLS8Mc2
[04:02:30] <systemfault> Looks fine.
[04:02:51] <systemfault> Is that website online by any chance?
[04:04:42] <sp3ck> yes it is
[04:05:15] <sp3ck> argh sorry it's not
[04:05:18] <sp3ck> online
[04:06:58] <sp3ck> so, the basic logic to use jQuery side-by-side with fb js is to use noConflict and it will be all right?
[04:07:05] <systemfault> No
[04:07:14] <systemfault> You don’t even need noConflict
[04:07:25] <sp3ck> ^^
[04:07:52] <systemfault> It’s for 1) You use a library that needs the $… like prototype.js 2) You have multiple versions of jQuery on a page.
[04:09:57] <sp3ck> i knew that before, but i thought that would be the problem cause of facebook's js...
[04:11:52] <BinaryKitten> sp3ck are you wrapping your JS code
[04:11:59] <systemfault> Billion of sites have both facebook and jquery… if both would conflict, everyone would be having your problem.
[04:12:05] <BinaryKitten> and making sure you don't have accidental globals?
[04:14:32] <michelleglauser> Hi everyone, I want to make a slideshow of images for a mobile app. As each image is shown full-screen, the user should be able to swipe it to the right (and off the screen) if they like it and to the left if they don't. I've been playing with TouchSwipe (http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/), but I'm not sure how to get images to disappear after being sorted using a left or right swipe, and I need the resulting sorted lists to be
[04:14:33] <michelleglauser> available for my use. Right now when the user swipes left, it goes back to the previous image instead of sorting the current image. Does anyone know where I can find an example of something similar to look at?
[04:14:34] <jeremib> I have a string of html, is it possible to use the jquery selector on it to pull out elements?
[04:15:29] <jeremib> michelleglauser: is there an event on swipe?  you can get the element and .remove() it
[04:15:55] <sp3ck> BinaryKitten, nope, no globals
[04:18:17] <michelleglauser> jeremib: there is. I've been playing around with hiding and removing and am not sure how to then capture the information well besides just adding each image to a yes and no list. Any ideas on how to assign values to them or something? Have you seen something similar somewhere that I could take a look at?
[04:19:07] <jeremib> michelleglauser: I use data attributes.  So assign each img element a data-id attribute with the id.  Then use .map() to get an array ofa ll your ids
[04:21:11] <star_prone> is there a way to declare all the options of a modal form (width, height, autoOpen, etc.) created with jqueryui using a single statement?
[04:29:54] <computer2000> what flash player should i use for html5 video fallback?
[04:30:09] <tristan1990> Hey. Hope this is the right place to be for this. I'm new to using javascript and API's. I'm trying to use a jquery plugin called GeoComplete to get the opening hours of the google place using the google place api. If anybody could have a quick look, I can't seem to get the opening hours displaying in my HTML page 'form.html' - all other details display.
[04:30:16] <tristan1990> https://github.com/tristan1990/geocomplete-new
[04:31:32] <michelleglauser> jeremib: okay, I'll try to figure that out. Thanks for the tip.
[04:33:30] <sp3ck> systemfault, from some reason if i remove "json" parameter from $.post it goes inside post's callback function and prints the console.log()... Any ideas why? (PHP echoes json btw)
[04:34:57] <systemfault> no :(
[04:48:00] <Xoro> http://jsfiddle.net/RaithPayne/xKGdb/1/ I'm trying to make it so when all divs are closed the last one folds and it shows a hidden div.
[04:49:34] <sp3ck> systemfault, just for the record... the problem was that i returned json_encode() from php function and not echoing it. It worked now. :S
[04:49:58] <systemfault> sp3ck: Cool :)
[04:58:49] <nisseni> I'm getting this response: http://pastie.org/private/yhrpdroav2jjt3u2fjqxpa - however, when I make if(hasLogo) - I get true, even thought hasLogo is false. ??
[04:59:10] <seutje> nisseni: it's a string
[04:59:18] <seutje> js> print(!!'false');
[04:59:24] <b-ot> seutje: true
[04:59:28] <seutje> js> print(!!false);
[04:59:32] <b-ot> seutje: false
[04:59:51] <seutje> strings are always truthy, unless they're empty or '0', I think
[04:59:55] <seutje> js> print(!!'0');
[05:00:00] <b-ot> seutje: true
[05:00:09] <seutje> nope, '0' is still truthy
[05:00:26] <Cork> js> print(!!"-1")
[05:00:31] <b-ot> Cork: true
[05:00:35] * Cork nods
[05:00:57] <Uhkis> someone's confusing js with php
[05:01:11] <nisseni> again...
[05:01:31] <Cork> ya
[05:01:56] <Cork> it's kinda a waste to store numbers as  strings too
[05:03:50] <seutje> dark: '1' <- this a boolean perchance?
[05:04:03] <star_prone> can anyone see what I'm writing on the channel?
[05:04:11] <seutje> nope
[05:04:19] <seutje> everyone can :D
[05:05:19] <tristan1990> Could somebody lend a hand with Google Places API with javasript? I can get all the place details except the opening times
[05:06:16] <IamTrying> http://www.jquery4u.com/api-calls/geo-location-2-lines-javascript/ -  does anyone know similar something in jQuery if available? this guy removed the file and it does not work
[05:08:30] <Cork> IamTrying: you need someplace to get the name from the location
[05:08:43] <Cork> IamTrying: but everything else is simple enough

[05:10:57] <masscrx> hi
[05:11:02] <t_user> o/
[05:12:25] <masscrx> https://gist.github.com/masscrx/7ef63a7187d991352402 this is my function for changing id of next element, and works fine, but when I add the second dom element, this function doesnt work for next element, it looks like this script doesnt see new dom elements created by jquery
[05:13:08] <masscrx> I think I should change something with 1 line
[05:13:18] <t_user> masscrx, i think .next() might be the problem
[05:13:46] <t_user> you should change .next to .siblings()
[05:14:04] <t_user> or nay.. i might be wrong
[05:14:24] <t_user> i'm trying to figure out how your html might look like
[05:14:27] <decx> impossible to tell without further markup
[05:14:49] <masscrx> one moment I make gist with html structure
[05:15:05] <Cork> masscrx: use nextAll().first
[05:15:11] <Cork> masscrx: use * nextAll().first()
[05:15:39] <Cork> ah
[05:15:44] <Cork> wait a min add new
[05:15:53] <Cork> you need to delegate the change listener
[05:16:29] <masscrx> Cork: I had similar problem some time ago and I remember that this is something with chage listener
[05:16:39] <t_user> $("#wrapper").on("change", ".items_select", function() { /* Do stuff * / });
[05:16:49] <Cork> ya
[05:17:14] <Cork> where #wrapper is a parent that is always there
[05:23:47] <masscrx> https://gist.github.com/masscrx/7ef63a7187d991352402
[05:23:51] <masscrx> this is my html structure
[05:24:08] <masscrx> and I want to add id to <div class="col-md-1 available_quantity">
[05:25:29] <erming> masscrx, look up. we might've solved your problems with event not hooking up to newly added dom elements
[05:27:41] <decx> btw i wouldn't change the id of an element, also you're changing it to a numerical value from your select, that is invalid sgml
[05:27:58] <decx> ids and classes can't start with a number
[05:29:15] <masscrx> decx: ok I didn;t know about it, co it could be value with some pattern ex. item_15
[05:29:48] <erming> masscrx, why don't you solve it like this: <div id="available" data-item-id="">Available:<br>15</div>
[05:30:16] <erming> that way, you don't have to select ".parent().next(".class")", but instead use $("#available"), and then use .data("item-id") to store the ID
[05:30:22] <decx> yeah if you start with a letter it's ok
[05:30:58] <decx> in a data-attribute it doesn't matter though, there you can put anything, but i don't know what you're trying to do with the id in there
[05:31:08] <decx> changing some css based on your selection?
[05:31:47] <masscrx> decx: but this html strucutre is in case with one item, when I add next item by jquery I will have another div with the same class
[05:32:54] <masscrx> so when changing <select> which is in div 'item_name', find next div and change id
[05:33:02] <decx> well i don't know what your overall plan is
[05:33:48] <masscrx> decx: https://gist.github.com/masscrx/7ef63a7187d991352402 this is html structure for one item, so when I'll create next item this could will be duplicated
[05:33:57] <masscrx> this code*
[05:35:17] <erming> masscrx are these new items added via javascript?
[05:35:44] <computer2000> anyone using videojs? i need to change the output controls html - how can i do that?
[05:36:11] <masscrx> erming: yes
[05:36:23] <erming> and your "change" event works, but only for the first item?
[05:36:31] <masscrx> yep
[05:36:48] <erming> okay, then it's the event not hooking up correctly when you add new items
[05:36:54] <masscrx> SO as someone said one moment before, I have to use another listener ->  $(".items_select").on("change", function() {
[05:37:16] <erming> try the solution we posted earlier: $("#parent_for_all_items").on("change", ".items_select", function() { /* Do stuff * / });
[05:37:34] <erming> that way you only have to declare that event once, and it will work even if you add new items
[05:40:17] <masscrx> erming: ok listener works fine
[05:40:50] <erming> great! :)
[05:40:57] <masscrx> but now I have to change data atrr
[05:41:20] <erming> yeah, data attributes are nice, especially for storing values or any kind
[05:41:22] <masscrx> so if I'll add some code to ^ this listener
[05:41:40] <masscrx> $(this) will be related to which element ?
[05:41:54] <erming> to the .items_select that changed
[05:42:02] <erming> so you will not really have to change your event code, it should just work
[05:42:43] <masscrx> event code is ok but I have to find some element in the next div
[05:43:10] <masscrx> because element which has to be changed with data atrr, is in next div
[05:44:31] <erming> yep, but you already wrote part of that code.. use your $(this).parent().next()-thingie
[05:47:29] <erming> i'll be disconnected (currently using an IRC-client i'm developing, need to reboot).. good luck!
[06:16:49] <FilipNortic> can I detecting overflow with for some fiv?
[06:18:05] <Cork> "overflow width for some div"?
[06:19:12] <FilipNortic> is there some jquery functiop or something wich is true only for divs with elements with overflow, or something like it?
[06:20:37] <erming> FilipNortic hmm.. There is something called scrollHeight
[06:20:40] <Cork> FilipNortic: no, if the element has a scrollbar you can detect it
[06:20:43] <davetarmac> hey guys - got a problem with a really simple script that shows/hides an <a> on a different element mouseenter
[06:20:49] <erming> are you specifially using overflow: hidden ?
[06:20:51] <davetarmac> http://jsfiddle.net/7N4sm/
[06:21:34] <davetarmac> I can't seem to target the <a> when the .image is hovered over
[06:21:48] <davetarmac> now I don't know if I'm overcomplicating it by using .on() or not
[06:21:50] <FilipNortic> no but i that I can switch to it i just need to know if there was an overflow somewere in the document
[06:22:19] <davetarmac> I know the mouseneter/mouseout events work since they're spitting strings to the console in Chrome
[06:22:59] <davetarmac> I've tried .children('a.btn') and .find('a.btn') but neither seemed to deliver the result I was expecting
[06:23:08] <Cork> davetarmac: problem is most likely that you need $(this).find('a.btn').show();
[06:23:11] <Cork> not this.find()
[06:23:52] <Cork> davetarmac: http://jsfiddle.net/7N4sm/2/ ?
[06:24:36] <davetarmac> Cork - just typed it in and it worked
[06:24:38] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/9yNA8/
[06:24:39] <davetarmac> How come though?
[06:24:47] <davetarmac> I'm assuming...
[06:24:55] <davetarmac> that $(this) is the actual element
[06:25:03] <davetarmac> whereas this would be somehting different
[06:25:07] <Cork> davetarmac: this is the dom element
[06:25:15] <erming> http://jsfiddle.net/9yNA8/1/ this might be better (font size might mess the last example up)
[06:25:25] <Cork> $(this) is the dom element wrapped in jquery so you can run jquery functions on it
[06:25:29] <erming> FilipNortic: look at my latest link
[06:25:31] <davetarmac> ah right
[06:26:03] <davetarmac> and obviously I needed to wrap it in the jQuery so I could actually manipulate it
[06:26:25] <davetarmac> thanks, Cork
[06:27:21] <erming> question: where to put my jquery plugins i've made? https://plugins.jquery.com/ and something like Bower?
[06:27:39] <FilipNortic> erming: that will work for now, thanks
[06:28:09] <Cork> erming: or github if you want to opensource it
[06:28:45] <erming> it's there.. but i'm looking for a way to "get it out there" :)
[06:29:02] <erming> example: http://erming.github.io/jquery-scroll-glue/
[06:29:29] <decx> add saas somewhere and post to hacker news
[06:30:11] <Cork> erming: plugins.jquery.com and getting it indexed by search engines is most likely your best bets
[06:30:20] <Cork> then ppl will find it if they need it
[06:30:22] <erming> okay, thanks
[06:30:41] <erming> yeah.. my current plugins might have a pretty narrow use case, hehe
[06:32:12] <nisseni> how can I get the last iteration of: http://pastie.org/private/hxdcd2weibaflexmufhsdg ?
[06:32:19] <decx> if i want to make a chatbox i now know where to look erming ;)
[06:33:43] <erming> decx: https://www.dropbox.com/s/44fw0u552zn5be0/chat_screenshot.PNG *cough cough*
[06:34:14] <decx> lol
[06:41:14] <FrankDWork> looking at the PHP side of my project theres always a post/get variable '_' -- is this generated by jQuery? if so, is there any documentation on how its generated?
[06:42:16] <erming> FrankDWork: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3687729/who-add-single-underscore-query-parameter
[06:42:41] <erming> blame IE :)
[06:43:40] <FrankDWork> actually its extremely useful for something i need to do :D
[06:43:50] <FrankDWork> for modifying an existing tool
[06:44:22] <FrankDWork> i didnt decouple a report creation with a trigger that the polling is done (this can take over 5 minutes since its polling up to 100k devices)
[06:44:30] <FrankDWork> so in chrome.. the socket doesnt time out
[06:44:45] <Cork> erming: uh, no
[06:44:54] <FrankDWork> for some reason firefox sends a TCP RST back if it takes too long when the server sends data back for the AJAX request
[06:45:05] <erming> Cork: no, what? :)
[06:45:07] <Cork> FrankDWork, erming the _= is a cache workaround
[06:45:14] <Cork> it isn't ie specific
[06:45:26] <FrankDWork> i see
[06:45:29] <Cork> it is there to make the url cache in the browser not match
[06:45:37] <Cork> so the request goes to the server
[06:45:58] <FrankDWork> im sure its useful for the request as well to make sure it isnt cached by say squid in the middle
[06:46:10] <Cork> ya, that too
[06:46:18] <krambiorix> hi, in a dialog i try to get the inputelement with data-xid='286'  but i don't get it... I try :       $('body').find("input[data-xid='286']").length  but this is always 0
[06:46:22] <krambiorix> what am i doing wrong?
[06:46:43] <FrankDWork> i wish they hashed the timestamp though.. or atleast used microseconds :)
[06:46:47] <erming> now when we're talking about this.. i remember tearing my hair of this some years ago, ajax requests being cached by IE7 or something
[06:46:48] <Cork> krambiorix: most likely cause your searching before it exist?
[06:47:01] <Cork> krambiorix: also just do $('[]')
[06:47:06] <krambiorix> Cork nope
[06:47:07] <Cork> no need to start with 'body'
[06:47:09] <FrankDWork> could theoretically have an http cache in the middle intercept and have the same timestamp from both requests, especially in a high load environment
[06:47:19] <FrankDWork> but i guess you could work around that in the application easily enough
[06:47:22] <erming> damn.. I really need to work on my english grammar
[06:47:24] <Cork> krambiorix: well the element doesn't exist
[06:47:38] <krambiorix> Cork, i added the data-xid with jquery
[06:47:41] <FrankDWork> erming, IE does cache a lot, i had to explicitly cache:false
[06:47:58] <Cork> krambiorix: data('xid', value) ?
[06:48:04] <krambiorix> Cork, when i loop through all input elements and show the xid data , the 286 shows up
[06:48:05] <FrankDWork> like people are on modems anymore :P
[06:48:10] <krambiorix> Cork, yes
[06:48:25] <Cork> krambiorix: data() doesn't update the dom attributes
[06:48:35] <Cork> krambiorix: it uses a cache to support more data types
[06:48:42] <Cork> if you need it in the dom use attr
[06:48:57] <Cork> attr('data-xid', value)
[06:49:33] <krambiorix> Cork, !! you're right (again!)
[06:49:40] <krambiorix> thanks a lot (again) Cork
[06:49:45] <Cork> ^^'
[06:49:56] <erming> ah, cool, never thought about setting data attributes via .attr()
[06:50:27] <krambiorix> same here :)
[06:50:52] <decx> for most people it's the other way around
[06:51:06] <Cork> i tend to use classes for selection and .data()
[06:55:16] <user258467> Hi, I have a script that is executed before jquery is loaded so $ is not known what is the best practice to fix this problem, how do I wait for juery is loaded?
[06:56:14] <erming> user258467: try to include jquery.js before that script
[06:56:38] <erming> would be the easiest way :>
[06:57:08] <FrankDWork> ooh data() eh?
[06:57:14] <FrankDWork> ive been using attr() since i dont know wtf im doing
[06:57:15] <FrankDWork> :p
[06:59:07] <gabriel> a
[07:05:02] <hirsty> hey all :3! using a .each() loop to get click events, after adding a li through jquery the .each wont work on it, is there any way to rectify this? (using.append)
[07:05:47] <TheWhisplab> Does anyone know anything about http://davidwalsh.name/classlist and whether it's preferable to use over Jquery's .addclass()?
[07:07:12] <Cork> hirsty: please show the code
[07:08:02] <hirsty> sec just making a fiddle :3
[07:08:14] <Cork> TheWhisplab: doesn't make much difference
[07:08:34] <TheWhisplab> okay
[07:08:35] <Cork> TheWhisplab: addClass was largely the source for the new classList property :)
[07:08:49] <TheWhisplab> http://jsperf.com/jquery-addclass-vs-dom-classlist/6
[07:08:52] <Cork> but it just splits a string and loops it so it is fast
[07:09:01] <TheWhisplab> shows classlist has having significantly better perf
[07:09:17] <TheWhisplab> not that I'd ever need 6 million ops/s
[07:10:04] <Cork> TheWhisplab: i didn't say it was as fast or faster
[07:10:11] <Cork> but it is normally fast enough to not matter
[07:10:25] <Cork> but yes native is always faster
[07:10:59] <TheWhisplab> yeah
[07:11:18] <Cork> it's to the point where i'm not even sure there is much point in adding support to jquery
[07:11:27] <Cork> could be interesting to check though
[07:12:49] <decx> oh there's an api for classlist now?
[07:13:43] <Cork> decx: no
[07:13:53] <HiMaX> hello, Why is this always undefined with no looping never http://bpaste.net/show/204044/
[07:13:56] <HiMaX>  or is it in impossible to do it
[07:14:54] <Cork> HiMaX: why don't you just store json instead?
[07:15:52] <HiMaX> Cork: i want to set all app settings in one place, i dont want to write localStorage everytime
[07:16:09] <Cork> you missed the point
[07:16:43] <Cork> HiMaX: http://bpaste.net/show/tTUAOIJ6ibsYRckCm4vf/
[07:17:51] <Cork> opps that code was reversed
[07:18:52] <HiMaX> Cork: its not working
[07:18:55] <Cork> HiMaX: http://bpaste.net/show/9nHFQUP0F7G0hS1ZvjJO/
[07:19:05] <Cork> ya, i reversed the functions :/
[07:19:32] <Cork> HiMaX: but to answer your original question
[07:19:39] <Cork> you looped the object
[07:19:46] <Cork> and grabbed the data from the database
[07:19:51] <Cork> but you never stored it
[07:19:55] <sprezzatura> I have two datepickers(of same id) under 2 different divs, how do I 'setup' them?
[07:20:17] <Cork> sprezzatura: you can't have two elements with the same id
[07:20:34] <slax0r> what does $(location).attr("href") retreive?
[07:20:36] <slax0r> current url?
[07:20:37] <HiMaX> Cork: it only output [object, Object]
[07:20:44] <sprezzatura> Cork: can the id be changed dyanmically?
[07:20:54] <Cork> HiMaX: yes cause objects are that
[07:21:02] <sprezzatura> Cork: say, they have the same id while rendering, but can we change them using jquery?
[07:21:03] <decx> probably undefined slax0r
[07:21:08] <Cork> HiMaX: replace alert with console.log if you want to inspect the object
[07:21:35] <Cork> sprezzatura: yes if you have the element you can set it with attr('id', 'new-id')
[07:21:48] <Cork> or prop('id', 'new-id')
[07:22:06] <Cork> sprezzatura: just note you can't select based on the id
[07:22:15] <Cork> cause id's can only ever exist on one element
[07:22:36] <decx> even if you change it afterwards it's still not valid to have the same id
[07:22:42] <sprezzatura> Cork: but can we differentiate using the parent hierarchy?
[07:22:43] <HiMaX> Cork: objects can output strings too, i do Object.myvar() in other code and get a string. Why is not working this time
[07:22:43] <decx> it's right there in the name: id
[07:23:10] <Cork> HiMaX: if you get a string you have json not an object
[07:23:38] <Cork> HiMaX: alert(JSON.stringify(dGetLoc()))
[07:24:06] <Cork> sprezzatura: you can select the not by id no
[07:24:22] <Cork> sprezzatura: to be clear, two elements with the same id is invalid html
[07:24:33] <HiMaX> Cork: i need to loop and create different localStorage items not just one
[07:24:41] <Cork> sprezzatura: if you ever need something like this use a class
[07:24:48] <Cork> sprezzatura: they are meant for that
[07:24:59] <Cork> HiMaX: why?
[07:25:06] <slax0r> decx: it's not undefined...
[07:25:39] <decx> slax0r yeah i just tested it myself. never used location with $() but there's a lot of interesting stuff in that object
[07:25:52] <HiMaX> Cork: i have to set all key/value items as localstorage in one function
[07:26:07] <Cork> HiMaX: ok?
[07:26:11] <Cork> why not just store json?
[07:26:30] <HiMaX> or is it impossible to set many items in localstorage at once without knowing the amount
[07:26:51] <Cork> so extract the old object, modify the value and set it all again
[07:26:59] <Cork> or have the value in page and just set it all in one go
[07:27:01] <HiMaX> i only use localStorage
[07:27:13] <Cork> well you use and object to set it
[07:27:33] <HiMaX> json.parse() not working on some smartphones
[07:27:45] <Cork> some really old ones yes
[07:27:49] <Cork> but then you just include json2.js
[07:28:34] <HiMaX> Cork: ok i will try fix it thanks
[07:29:33] <Cork> HiMaX: but yes you could do something like this http://bpaste.net/show/8JbBfLNDseltEaV3Xc1l/
[07:29:46] <Cork> but it would break if you ever added values to the object
[07:31:24] <sprezzatura> Cork: thanks.
[07:32:21] <HiMaX> Cork: somehow localStorage is not saving the keys/values , i dunno. I will google a bit on it
[07:32:41] <Cork> HiMaX: you might hit the max storage
[07:32:59] <Cork> HiMaX: also don't forget that you need to check for hasOwnProperty
[07:35:08] <hirsty> my example > http://jsfiddle.net/b34GP/2/
[07:35:10] <HiMaX> Cork: i forgot about the hasOwnProperty, i use that to create seperate arrays from the key/value object. I will see if i have any luck with that thanks
[07:35:30] <Cork> HiMaX: i would still go the json route
[07:35:36] <Cork> but well do as you like
[07:35:39] <hirsty> Clicking on elements in the list lets you remove them but adding elements and then trying to click on them does not remove them
[07:36:12] <Cork> hirsty: suspected as much
[07:36:20] <Cork> hirsty: never add event listeners in a loop
[07:36:24] <HiMaX> Cork: if every localStorage attempt fails , i will go the json route :)
[07:36:26] <Cork> use delegated event listeners
[07:36:46] <Cork> HiMaX: the json solution would still be a localStorage solution
[07:36:51] <Cork> just with less duplicated data
[07:38:02] <Cork> hirsty: is $("input[name=userSelection]").each(function () { really meant to be there?
[07:38:16] <HiMaX> Cork: oh , so you mean change the settings object into a json object and parse from there
[07:38:46] <Cork> HiMaX: change appSett
[07:39:01] <Cork> HiMaX: and when you've changed it serialize it to json and push it to localStorage
[07:39:22] <Cork> HiMaX: that way you only ever need to read the data from localStorage on page load
[07:39:35] <Cork> (or the first time you access if you prefer that solution)
[07:40:00] <hirsty> Cork: that is part of another function that is working correctly
[07:40:20] <Cork> hirsty: but it isn't looping around the each function?
[07:40:32] <HiMaX> Cork: i see, so i can still through json to create the localStorage items
[07:40:44] <HiMaX> loop*
[07:40:49] <hirsty> 	$("#people li").each(function(){ is the issue im having
[07:41:18] <hirsty> it isnt removing elements created by my jquery
[07:41:20] <Cork> HiMaX: not items
[07:41:23] <Cork> HiMaX: one item
[07:41:35] <Cork> HiMaX: one "settings" item with the json in it
[07:41:51] <Cork> hirsty: http://jsfiddle.net/b34GP/3/
[07:41:59] <Cork> i removed the function you said wasn't related
[07:42:30] <Cork> hirsty: if the loop is around this function then the code most likely doesn't work
[07:42:58] <hirsty> oh :/
[07:44:15] <HiMaX> Cork: my apps wont work that way, it must be a specific key and value , i use the same object for settings in other parts of the app
[07:44:58] <Cork> HiMaX: but your not storing them uniquely in the database
[07:45:20] <Cork> or are you saying appSett isn't global?
[07:45:28] <Cork> (if not then make it global)
[07:45:50] <HiMaX> Cork: i do, un the sqlite database each one has its own key/value
[07:46:05] <Cork> HiMaX: for the same object ya....
[07:46:07] <HiMaX> appSett is global
[07:46:33] <Cork> HiMaX: i don't get what the problem is...
[07:47:03] <Cork> appSett.value = newValue; window.localStorage.setItem('settings', appSett);
[07:47:05] <Cork> opps
[07:47:13] <Cork> appSett.value = newValue; window.localStorage.setItem('settings', JSON.stringify(appSett));
[07:47:18] <apipkin> I have a jquery widget I'm building. I have an options property of `maxHeight`. However, when I set a value, no matter the value, I always get '20px' in the dom. Any clue why that's happening?
[07:47:34] <Cork> appSett = JSON.parse(window.localStorage.setItem('settings'));
[07:47:40] <apipkin> Even `console.log(this.options.maxHeight)` is returning 20, no matter the value set
[07:47:45] <Cork> HiMaX: why doesn't this work for you exactly?
[07:48:03] <hirsty> Cork - what if that function is used elsewhere?
[07:48:45] <Cork> hirsty: AddToList you mean?
[07:49:13] <HiMaX> Cork: its okay , i need to rely on one point to set settings for the whole apps functions. Its strictly localStorage . I will try more things, the json confuses me, since that isnt how i did all the other apps
[07:49:17] <hirsty> all of them :3
[07:49:57] <Cork> HiMaX: no instead you break the object down and store each key/value pair individually
[07:50:14] <Cork> that means the code needs to be a lot more complicated
[07:50:24] <Cork> and you still risk leaking old values
[07:50:45] <Cork> hirsty: there is only one function one can use elsewhere there
[07:51:37] <hirsty> hmm?
[07:52:17] <Cork> hirsty: i think you need to explain what you mean
[07:52:44] <HiMaX> Cork: can i still set the default settings values in one place with json, then loop them to create a localStorage item for each of them  window.localStorage.setItem('settings', 'KEY AND VALUE'));
[07:53:09] <Cork> HiMaX: no
[07:53:12] <hirsty> Sorry, basically im wanting people to be able to both add and remove items from a list
[07:53:20] <Cork> HiMaX: json is a javascript object converted to a string
[07:53:23] <Cork> you can't loop it
[07:53:45] <Cork> HiMaX: the reason you create json of the object is cause localstorage only allow you to store strings
[07:53:50] <HiMaX> Cork: then it will be impossible to do it with json
[07:54:11] <Cork> HiMaX: your still stuck in the "store every key separately"
[07:54:21] <Cork> but you haven't shown a single reason for it
[07:56:17] <HiMaX> Cork: i use localStorage as cache for the app. The users settings is saved in sqlite database and loaded into localStorage from the database on each startup of the app.
[07:56:28] <Cork> HiMaX: sure
[07:56:44] <Cork> that isn't a reason to split the settings up into separate entries in the database
[07:57:18] <HiMaX> Cork: its confusing, i will try again later. thanks for the help though
[07:58:53] <TheWhisplab> hi
[07:59:31] <TheWhisplab> I'm trying to change a css property of a class depending on a certain variable and then add that class to an element
[07:59:58] <TheWhisplab> But it's not working properly. It just changes the CSS property inline
[08:00:09] <TheWhisplab> But I want it to change it of the class itself
[08:00:35] <apipkin> TheWhisplab: You'll probably have to work with the style sheet node directly. If you are wanting to generate a classname and not just add styles to a node
[08:01:09] <TheWhisplab> apipkin, any references on that? I don't know how I'd do that
[08:02:19] <apipkin> TheWhisplab: this may help http://www.w3.org/wiki/Dynamic_style_-_manipulating_CSS_with_JavaScript
[08:02:43] <TheWhisplab> Thanks
[08:02:48] <TheWhisplab> bluh this looks complex
[08:04:40] <apipkin> Well it's more complex than using jquery to grab a handful of nodes and changing their css properties. But, depending on the implementation, it could be more performant?
[08:04:48] <TheWhisplab> Maybe
[08:04:57] <TheWhisplab> Still seems like something jquery should be able to do
[08:05:10] <apipkin> TheWhisplab: YUI has something like this built in (http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/stylesheet/) but I haven't seen it in jQuery just yet
[08:05:52] <TheWhisplab> Is YUI just a jquery alternative?
[08:09:47] <apipkin> I wouldn't say "alternative" necessarily, but it's a javascript framework, yes. They both have their pros and cons and things they are better suited for. Just as any framework/library/language
[08:13:30] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> hi guys
[08:13:36] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> Just a quick question
[08:13:48] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> Can I simulate a keypress?
[08:14:02] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> Like if I press the enter key, can I have it pressed twice?
[08:16:09] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> anyone?
[08:16:24] <apipkin> NKoreaSpaceProgr: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/832059/definitive-way-to-trigger-keypress-events-with-jquery
[08:16:46] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> Yup, googled it already, didn't really understand what I should do
[08:17:11] <decx> why simulate another keypress when you can change the function that is fired directly
[08:17:22] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> Also, the main reason I came here was to ask if I could acrually simulate it inside a textarea
[08:17:52] <apipkin> I would question the implementation of the keypress
[08:18:03] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> decx: because when I press the return key I want a double new line

[08:19:20] <prometh> hi
[08:20:02] <prometh> let's pretend that $ and jQuery are not global.... if i send $("something") as an argument to a function, how might i get back to the root object ($) ?
[08:20:15] <prometh> is there something like $("something").getJQueryObject() ?
[08:20:28] <prometh> or $("something").get$()
[08:23:27] <prometh> or is $("something").find(":root") the only way ?
[08:25:16] <prometh> too advanced for you ppl?
[08:25:44] <NKoreaSpaceProgr> anything?
[08:33:49] <Fishy> So the following line works fine in Chrome. But is throwing ''target.dataset.contentid' is null or not an object' in IE 8.. Is there a better way i can get the data attributes of the closed item? $('.tablePopupContainer').bind({popupafterclose: function(event, ui) { update_slas(event.target.dataset.contentid); }});

[09:01:56] <azka> })(jQuery);
[09:03:04] <azka> is my code true?
[09:04:48] <shubhamGeek> azka the last line is supposed to be just }); and not })(jquery);

[09:17:26] <azka> ankurk_ : thanks :-) .. iam looking for jsfidel
[09:17:37] <shubhamGeek> azka: and your last line of script should be }); instead of })();
[09:17:52] <ankurk_> azka: It's jsfiddle*
[09:18:22] <krambiorix> when i try : $(".myinput").tooltip( "destroy" );  -> i get  : data[option] is not a function   ... what cna i do?

[09:23:26] <sdwrage> Hey all
[09:23:42] <sdwrage> is there any way to re-enable a link that had preventDefault?
[09:23:54] <sdwrage> twitter bootstrap disables a link that I later want to re-enable
[09:25:58] <azka> shubhamGeek not work to :-(
[09:27:17] <shubhamGeek> azka: go to http://jsfiddle.net/ , paste your code there, save it.. copy the url and paste it here.
[09:29:40] <azka> my html code on one page ?
[09:31:37] <shubhamGeek> azka: there are separate sections for html, css, js on jsfiddle..just paste the code in relevant sections.
[09:37:19] <puchacz> hi, has anybody got a URL handy for a plugin that would send search request when I scroll to the bottom of the page, like in facebook?
[09:37:31] <duch_kazatel> puchacz you mean infinite scroll?
[09:37:44] <puchacz> duch_kazetel: I don't know what it is called
[09:38:14] <puchacz> each scroll would basically repeat the same query but with extra condition: skip the following IDs
[09:38:26] <duch_kazatel> when you hit the bottom of the page, it loads in the next "set" of content, right?
[09:38:27] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[09:38:28] <duch_kazatel> this is one.
[09:38:33] <duch_kazatel> http://jscroll.com/ this is another.
[09:38:34] <puchacz> yes, thanks
[09:38:38] <duch_kazatel> you could also hand-roll your own.
[09:38:46] <puchacz> possibly :-)
[09:38:54] <duch_kazatel> fyi, you don't want to say "skip these ids" - set up pagination and call the next page of content.
[09:39:28] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I actually want to "skip these IDs", as I don't have natural order of results
[09:40:29] <duch_kazatel> you might want to reconsider your setup, then, because that list will end up becoming quite large on your frontend i'll bet.
[09:40:39] <decx> man, i've come to hate the infinite scroll mechanic
[09:41:00] <puchacz> it shouldn't be a problem with post request
[09:41:01] <puchacz> or
[09:41:04] <decx> nothing wrong with a load more button
[09:41:17] <duch_kazatel> puchacz eh, i'd still do that tracking server-side.
[09:41:34] <puchacz> decx: right, it may have better usability
[09:41:42] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: ok, I agree
[09:42:06] <puchacz> decx: any particular reason you hate infinite scroll?
[09:42:24] <decx> autoload on scroll is prone to errors, even with a matured solution like infinte scroll
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> and depending on the context you're doing the scroll, you might be creating a difficult time when a user clicks on something and then comes back to where they were.
[09:43:16] <puchacz> true
[09:43:30] <puchacz> in general, with ajax, back button may be confusing
[09:43:37] <decx> all in all it's a bit too overbearing for my ux tastes
[09:43:59] <puchacz> hmmm, I may like "load more" button
[09:44:08] <duch_kazatel> puchacz huh?  "with ajax, back button may be confusing"?
[09:44:14] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't make much sense.
[09:44:33] <decx> it's confusing to implement
[09:45:31] <puchacz> imho, back button was hard to implement in the old days, now in ajax days it is still harder and more confusing to the user. where exactly would it lead?
[09:45:51] <duch_kazatel> puchacz you only worry about it when you are changing the content of the page itself.
[09:46:02] <puchacz> this is what ajax is for
[09:46:10] <puchacz> change stuff here and there
[09:46:12] <nhulea> yo yo yo
[09:46:12] <duch_kazatel> if I'm going to the "next page" of content, insert a history entry or update the hash.
[09:46:23] <duch_kazatel> puchacz that's not the only thing it gets used for.
[09:46:31] <decx> you scroll up to the start of the last set of loaded content until you hit the startpoint from where you go back to default backbutton behaviour
[09:46:32] <duch_kazatel> we use it to drive our pagination in our search.
[09:47:18] <decx> i got a free nokia e7
[09:47:23] <decx> amazing specs for a 2011 phone
[09:47:28] <duch_kazatel> puchacz that's why we have hashes/pushstates available :)
[09:47:29] <decx> but good lord is symbian terrible
[09:47:40] <duch_kazatel> decx i'll bet.  things have changed a lot, even in three years.
[09:48:08] <decx> 16gb internal memory, hdmi out, nice amoled, great physical slidekeyboard
[09:48:12] <decx> but dat os
[09:48:14] <decx> jesus
[10:12:59] <d0de>  Is the an elegant way to perform an operation on every property of an object? Like in this situation: http://jsbin.com/deximida/1/edit say you wanted to run "doubleCountry()" on every country in the object. Is there a way to do this without copy-pasting doubleCountry("Germany"); doubleCountry("Canada"); etc ?
[10:13:19] <duch_kazatel> you could do a for loop.
[10:13:41] <d0de> duch_kazatel, what would that look like please? I've never used one before
[10:14:28] <BillCriswell> d0de: for()
[10:15:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsbin.com/deximida/4/edit
[10:15:44] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thank you, that's extremely helpful
[10:16:05] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[10:23:05] <decx> why the hasownproperty? isn't that implied in a for x in y loop
[10:23:52] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135448/how-do-i-check-to-see-if-an-object-has-a-property-in-javascript/136411#136411
[10:24:25] <BillCriswell> I may fall asleep standing up today.
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> for...in doesn't imply that.  i usually supply people with that answer in case they're doing something funky with their objects.
[10:24:49] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell rough weekend?
[10:24:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Extremely.
[10:25:33] <BillCriswell> One of my best friends got married Friday and Saturday I was out drinking again till 5am.
[10:25:39] <duch_kazatel> niiiiice
[10:25:43] <decx> ah, js shenanigans, right
[10:25:43] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:27:39] <decx> it's easy, duct-tape yourself to the table
[10:30:23] <duch_kazatel> i spent huge swaths of time this weekend floating in my pool.
[10:30:34] <duch_kazatel> it was glorious
[10:34:43] <d0de> duch_kazatel: with http://jsbin.com/deximida/4/edit , suppose you had a function for each country called FranceFunction(), GermanyFunction() etc . Is there a way to call each country's respective function from inside the for loop, using just the country name from myObject{} ?
[10:36:22] <decx> have a single function, pass the country as an argument and do different stuff in your one function depending on that argument
[10:39:21] <d0de> I've actually expressed myself poorly, I realize. I apologize, I got confused. What I actually need to do is access a global variable for each country that is based on the country name. E.g. FranceVariable, GermanyVariable etc
[10:40:05] <d0de> is it possible to manipulate text strings and end up with a variable name in such a way that the variable can actually be used? I don't have a good understanding of the relationship between a variable name and it's textual representation
[10:40:54] <decx> var mydynamicvar = yes; myobject[mydynamicvar]; will call myobject['yes']
[10:42:13] <duch_kazatel> d0de be aware that you can't dynamically evaluate, say, a variable, but you CAN dynamically evaluate property names.  that's exactly what your doubleCountry func is doing.
[10:42:24] <duch_kazatel> what decx shows you the gist.
[10:42:45] <NoiseEee> d0de: perhaps you want a few different 'country' objects. and you can make generic functions that operate based on the country object/country name passed
[10:43:16] <d0de> yes, perhaps using two different objects would make things simpler. Thank you everyone
[11:05:12] <d0de> if you have a function that is a passed a country name, "france", and there is a global variable called france, and you want to perform an operation like france.slider("refresh"), how would you do it? because in this case, the function is passed "france" as an object property, not as a variable name, But they are the same, so I get very confused :'(
[11:05:44] <duch_kazatel> d0de you shouldn't have global vars like that.
[11:06:23] <duch_kazatel> d0de if you really need things to be global, make them properties of a single object.  then you can do exactly what you're looking for.
[11:07:38] <d0de> ok, so if you had an object like thisObject = { france: ('#france-slider') } could you then perform an operation like thisObject[france].slider("refresh") ?
[11:08:09] <d0de> oops, I mean { france: $('#france-slider') }
[11:08:28] <BillCriswell> d0de: thisObject['france'] or thisObject.france
[11:08:35] <duch_kazatel> d0de yep.
[11:08:44] <d0de> ok, but that's allowed? Oh ok that's really cool, thanks
[11:08:53] <duch_kazatel> d0de yeah.  why wouldn't it be?
[11:09:11] <duch_kazatel> aren't all "global" vars technically properties of the window object anyway?
[11:09:24] <d0de> is that so?
[11:09:40] <d0de> is it bad practice to have properties in different objects with the same name?
[11:09:50] <duch_kazatel> totally depends on what you're doing.
[11:11:36] <jimi_> does .on() listen on elements that were not bound to the dom when the method was registered?
[11:13:14] <BillCriswell> jimi_: No.
[11:13:25] <jimi_> BillCriswell, .live used to :(
[11:13:33] <BillCriswell> jimi_: You want event delegation I think.
[11:13:56] <BillCriswell> $(document).on('click', '.doesnt-matter-when-i-was-created', function  () { /* weee */ });
[11:14:06] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ .live() basically attached a listener to the document, instead of the element.
[11:15:16] <duch_kazatel> .on() is more flexible imo.
[11:15:51] <jimi_> .on() isn't firing unless i call it after the elements are created. I have dynamic content that is coming in via ajax, and wanna attach handlers to those automagically.
[11:16:09] <BillCriswell> jimi_: The demo I just showed you would do that.
[11:16:10] <duch_kazatel> $(document).on('event', 'element', function(){});
[11:16:32] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ but be aware that doesn't attach listeners automagically.
[11:16:35] <jimi_> Is it because I am doing $('.class').on('click', function() { });
[11:16:43] <d0de> please, what's the difference between thisObject['france'] and thisObject.france ?
[11:16:51] <duch_kazatel> d0de nothing :)
[11:16:51] <BillCriswell> d0de: Nothing.
[11:16:57] <d0de> ty
[11:16:59] <BillCriswell> Just a way to fuck with you.
[11:17:00] <duch_kazatel> d0de one uses object property access notation.
[11:17:29] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ in that case, you are attaching to elements.  you are not using delegation in that examplke.
[11:18:31] <BillCriswell> d0de: People will usually use [] when they have a variable, you can do thisObject[someVar] but not thisObject.someVar
[11:19:19] <d0de> BillCriswell, ok, thank you, that's helpful
[11:19:25] <oskarstrinitis> anyone have any idea how to send mass email where as 1st column is email address and 2nd and 3rd column is element that has to be included in message?
[11:19:31] <oskarstrinitis> from excel
[11:19:55] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ .live() would attach a listener to document that would trigger when a bubbled event's target properly matched the selector.
[11:20:03] <BillCriswell> oskarstrinitis: Not really a jQuery related question there.
[11:20:17] <jimi_> duch_kazatel, ah gotcha
[11:20:26] <oskarstrinitis> Yeh i know, was worth a shot tho (:
[11:20:30] <duch_kazatel> jimi_ so use .on(), but bind as low in the document as you can.
[11:20:33] <BillCriswell> oskarstrinitis: You'd want to do that on the server side. I'd just #whateverlanguageyoureusing
[11:40:49] <d0de> I have a cancel button that gets bound via myButton.click() to various different actions based on where the user is. Should I be unbinding the button before rebinding it? will one click handler override the previous, or do I have to clear it explicitly?
[11:41:01] <duch_kazatel> only bind once.
[11:41:20] <duch_kazatel> every time you call .click(function(){});, you're binding again,.'
[11:41:38] <duch_kazatel> if you need to explicitly remove a handler, .off() is a good idea, but i'd avoid doing that.
[11:42:32] <d0de> duch_kazatel, how can I change the click handler without rebinding it?
[11:42:40] <duch_kazatel> what are you changing about it?
[11:43:24] <d0de> well at the moment each click handler has an anonymous function that does various stuff like hiding UI elements and cancelling setTimeouts, etc
[11:44:02] <krambiorix> i have strings that end with a number... (eg. mytitle5) -> how can i get the number out of the string?
[11:44:46] <duch_kazatel> d0de use one handler and do everything in there.
[11:45:17] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix use a regular expression?
[11:45:26] <Jattenalle> krambiorix, is it always the last 1 character of the string?
[11:45:59] <Jattenalle> if it is, just grab the last character.. if it's not.. then use regex as duch_kazatel said
[11:47:07] <lilltiger> or the last two or three chars and check if they are numbers, if you need it to go above 9/99/999
[11:47:27] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/J85kn/
[11:47:28] <duch_kazatel> imo
[11:47:36] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't check the end of the string.
[11:47:47] <duch_kazatel> krambiorix some more specificity would be helpful.
[11:47:57] <BillCriswell> Needs some $, ya'll.
[11:48:09] <duch_kazatel> dolla dolla
[11:48:18] <lilltiger> duch_kazatel: well regexp are very slow in comparassion, so  it depends on what he does
[11:48:27] <duch_kazatel> i am aware!
[11:48:37] <BillCriswell> This is such a simple one, though.
[11:48:37] <duch_kazatel> but he gave very little info, so it's hard to know what exactly he wants.
[11:48:44] <lilltiger> indeed
[11:48:47] <duch_kazatel> also: depending on what all he'
[11:48:56] <duch_kazatel> *he's doing, the performance hit might not be important.
[11:49:04] <lilltiger> probly not
[11:49:16] <duch_kazatel> brb lunch
[11:50:14] <BillCriswell> Hm, matches returns null if there's no matches.
[11:50:24] <BillCriswell> Figured it would give me an empty array.
[11:51:56] <afroradiohead> i have a question about qunit and was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction
[11:52:56] <afroradiohead> is it best to run tests on the browser? or is it recommended to do it on something like phantomjs?
[11:53:00] <krambiorix> waw duch_kazatel thanks for the fiddle!
[11:53:34] <krambiorix> i just want to get the number at the end of a string
[11:53:35] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: You probably actualy want /\d+$/
[11:53:46] <Jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/AY5aL/443/ - can anyone help me get "direction" to work? :)
[11:54:21] <BillCriswell> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/J85kn/1/
[11:59:15] <Jacta> anyone? guess its simple
[11:59:41] <decx> Jacta what is the dobounce supposed to do?
[12:00:13] <decx> i don't see a difference
[12:00:37] <Jacta> just "bounce" but, direction is not parsed
[12:00:56] <Jacta> if you change both to "left" you'll see - iwant to take "left" from argument
[12:01:07] <decx> doesn't work for object keys
[12:01:24] <decx> it'll still be direction: '-='+left
[12:01:52] <decx> uh not +left
[12:01:56] <decx> but you get what i mean
[12:03:22] <Jacta> Then how do I solve it? :)
[12:04:07] <tomkralidis> hi: using Flot, does any one have example of colouring the points on a line graph?
[12:04:39] <freemh> Hi
[12:06:07] <freemh> is there any resource describe more deeply how browsers based on a webkit engine interpret HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT ?
[12:10:01] <krambiorix> BillCriswell, yes, thanks!
[12:15:28] <tristan1990> hey. I'm trying to get the opening_hours showing from the google api on my html page. I'm using geocomplete jquery plugin. Can anybody help - http://jsfiddle.net/YsdGB/
[12:26:15] <decx> aw he's gone, just as i found some time
[12:26:29] <decx> for the lurkers, create an object beforehand and pass that in animate
[12:27:10] <BillCriswell> "lurk" is a terrible word.
[12:27:15] <BillCriswell> Can attractive people "lurk"?
[12:27:51] <decx> the other 834 certainly don't write
[12:28:07] <jphase> hehe
[12:28:14] <jphase> </eavesdrop>
[12:28:16] <decx> and words are the only thing making you beautiful on irc
[12:28:42] <decx> 833 then ^^
[12:29:06] <BillCriswell> There are a lot of people in here who never talk.
[12:29:51] <ankurk_> Like me :P
[12:30:04] <BillCriswell> Haha
[12:30:24] <BillCriswell> I don't know if I'm making it to 5.
[12:30:42] <luchenbill> if I was going to do a simple jquery animation for a group of <a href='#'><img src='' /></a> where you hover over the img/a and there is little colored text/bg layer that is about 90% of the images width/height what would be the easiest approach to this
[12:31:24] <decx> pure css isntead of animate
[12:34:27] <BillCriswell> luchenbill: Agreed with decx.
[12:35:37] <luchenbill> so it's possible to use pure css? damn maybe I have some learning to do haha
[12:36:03] <luchenbill> this is what I have so far, just as far as testing
[12:36:04] <luchenbill> http://jsfiddle.net/mrBeZ/
[12:37:34] <BillCriswell> luchenbill: http://jsbin.com/ganosomi/1/edit?html,css,output
[12:37:46] <tristan1990> I talk ;) - I'll give somebody £5 for a little help - I think its a really quick job, I'm just so stuck
[12:38:18] <luchenbill> holy crap BillCriswell that was fast/nice
[12:38:38] <decx> luchenbill also http://jsfiddle.net/sK646/
[12:39:02] <BillCriswell> That cat looks douchey.
[12:39:04] <luchenbill> holy crap css has gotten powerful in the last year...
[12:39:06] <luchenbill> *face desk*
[12:39:17] <BillCriswell> luchenbill: Yeah, it is awesome.
[12:39:26] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell keeping it real with vanilla ice
[12:39:34] <luchenbill> is there a css property that allows you to fade something depending on which way the mouse came in?
[12:39:38] <BillCriswell> If the browser doesn't support animations it'll just show immediately, which is a great fallback.
[12:39:51] <BillCriswell> luchenbill: I think you'd need to use javascript for that.
[12:39:54] <decx> wait til you find out about content: attr(title) and such
[12:39:55] <luchenbill> BillCriswell: yeah that's a great fall back
[12:40:17] <luchenbill> you guys know of any newer dox that would explain some of the stuff you guys are talking about?
[12:40:23] <luchenbill> css-tricks.com perhapse?
[12:40:38] <luchenbill> what do you mean decx?
[12:41:02] <BillCriswell> css tricks is an great resource.
[12:41:18] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 i'd just ask your question and we'll help.
[12:41:22] <BillCriswell> decx: Kick it one time boyyyeee
[12:41:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah. I hate money.
[12:41:42] <duch_kazatel> haha
[12:42:31] <rand0m_> join #jquery-content
[12:42:42] <BillCriswell> ... wonder what that is.
[12:42:43] <decx> luchenbill http://jsfiddle.net/sK646/1/ it reads the title attribute from the a for the styled caption
[12:43:12] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that channel?
[12:43:21] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[12:43:32] <duch_kazatel> i think it's the documentation room.
[12:43:58] <tristan1990> Okay. I've been trying to fix this problem for days. Basically I want a HTML page whereby you search for a 'Place' with the google API and it displays the place info, including the opening_hours. I used the geocomplete jquery plugin and can get all the details loading up except the opening times.
[12:44:19] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ tristan1990

[12:44:52] <BillCriswell> I just can't get into yeoman.
[12:44:58] <luchenbill> all though I feel confident with html/css/js I can't believe css is doing this
[12:45:00] <luchenbill> lmfao
[12:45:08] <luchenbill> oh why did I learn so much js in the past :P
[12:45:24] <BillCriswell> You didn't have a choice if you were doing something awesome.
[12:45:43] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 setup a functioning example in jsfiddle if possble.
[12:45:46] <duch_kazatel> *possible
[12:45:53] <tristan1990> okay, ill try

[12:50:42] <luchenbill> .....
[12:50:54] <luchenbill> yes, jesus christ, so now css is like a programming language instead of a formatting language
[12:50:59] <BillCriswell> She's some kind of evil genius.
[12:51:09] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel Is it working for you? It's missing the map, but the details are there and thats where I'd like the opening hours to appear
[12:51:10] <luchenbill> I don't understand but that's amazing
[12:51:12] <duch_kazatel> it's still geared for presentation, but it does much more that it used to.
[12:51:29] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 i'd like a functional example is possible.
[12:51:51] <tristan1990> Okay, no problem - hold on
[12:52:24] <ankurk_> BillCriswell: it's all maths :P
[12:52:37] <BillCriswell> ankurk_: Yeah.. I am definitely not much of a math guy.
[12:53:13] <luchenbill> >> console.log('hi');
[12:53:21] <luchenbill> wrong chan... lol
[12:53:24] <duch_kazatel> no repl in here sadly :(
[12:53:26] <duch_kazatel> same bot though.
[12:54:23] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel this is working properly now - http://jsfiddle.net/7cJhA/1/
[12:54:42] <tristan1990> as in, thats how it looks when I'm testing it using web browser and sublime
[12:54:58] <duch_kazatel> awesome - http://jsfiddle.net/7cJhA/2/ I removed the body and html tags since they don't play nicely.
[12:55:04] <duch_kazatel> okay, so what's your question now?
[12:56:56] <tristan1990> So, when I query Google for a place (I usually use Apple Store as they have the opening times details on google) the details at the bottom work, except for the opening times ones - I think its something to do with the geocomplete plugin I've included in the javascript underneath the html
[12:56:57] <BillCriswell> In the mood for some pretzel m&ms.
[13:00:31] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 where is $.log() coming from?
[13:00:40] <Ownix> Does anyone here use the JQuery validation plugin
[13:01:11] <tristan1990> I kept that in because it was in the jquery plugin and I didnt really know what it does :/
[13:03:39] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 i'm very confused about what you're doing - you've got two inits happening in there.  is this on purpose?
[13:06:01] <tristan1990> It's not on purpose and I realise it's really badly coded. I'm still pretty new to javascript and just looking for a way to get it working. Sorry if its made it hard for you. Basically the 6th list item underneath the google map I would like it to display the opening times for every day of the week. I can load up all the other details using the <span>, but whatever I try to get the opening hours
[13:06:01] <tristan1990> doesn't seem to work.
[13:06:14] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel
[13:07:14] <decx> i have no idea what's going on
[13:07:50] <decx> i assume the details: "form" specifies your output parent and in there it looks for data-geo attributes
[13:08:27] <decx> and the opening hours are an object
[13:09:35] <tristan1990> Yeah I think so. Heres a screenshot - https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35104004/LittleSnapper.png
[13:10:01] <tristan1990> I don't know why it comes up with [object] [Object] instead of the opening hours
[13:10:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/7cJhA/6/
[13:10:15] <duch_kazatel> to clean some stuff up.
[13:10:22] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 how did you get that to show?
[13:10:31] <duch_kazatel> aaaah down below.
[13:11:02] <decx> did you see geocomplete use an object somewhere else?
[13:11:09] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel Thanks, is that a cleaner version of the code then?
[13:11:11] <decx> everything else is strings
[13:11:39] <duch_kazatel> aaah, tristan1990 the data that comes back for that is going to require some extra massaging.
[13:11:58] <tristan1990> I think its because the Opening Hours details (e.g. open_now) are in a sub catagory in the Places API -https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_search_requests
[13:12:06] <duch_kazatel> not "sub category"
[13:12:25] <tristan1990> ha, didn't think that would be the word - do you know what I mean though?
[13:12:29] <decx> it looks like this: http://paste2.org/G08C7v0v
[13:12:37] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/FWFkw/
[13:12:42] <duch_kazatel> this is the data itself.
[13:13:03] <tristan1990> Ahh okay. So how do you get to the sub level of opening_hours?
[13:13:08] <duch_kazatel> *property
[13:13:52] <tristan1990> I've tried opening_hours.open_now, but I don't think that worked
[13:14:16] <duch_kazatel> do you just want to know if it'
[13:14:21] <duch_kazatel> *it's currently open, or the hours?
[13:14:47] <tristan1990> Yes, anything. I think when I know how to do one of the properties I can work out how the others work
[13:15:37] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel - Seriously, thanks. I realise it's frustrating when I obviously don't know what I'm talking about!
[13:17:50] <decx> tristan1990 in line 436, it's writing the new text in your span
[13:17:59] <decx> $element.text(value);
[13:18:41] <decx> before that you can check if you value is a string or an object and loop through the opening object to create a list
[13:18:45] <duch_kazatel> decx yeah per the docs you specify by adding data attributes to elements - data-geo="rating" puts the rating there.
[13:19:19] <SunsparcSolaris> Hello, would anyone be able to help me with the jquery-ui Accordion example? I want to have all sections collapsed on page load.
[13:20:00] <shoky> SunsparcSolaris: set active to false
[13:20:11] <SunsparcSolaris> Where would I set that?
[13:20:33] <shoky> when you initialize it,  .accordion({active: false})
[13:20:36] <tristan1990> decx duch_kazatel Okay. Would I remove those lines then? Which bit would I actually change to add the opening_hours?
[13:20:45] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 don't remove anythinbg.
[13:21:11] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 i'm not seeing any way to access object properties through this.
[13:21:12] <SunsparcSolaris> Awesome, thank you
[13:22:19] <tristan1990> Oh no, that doesn't sound good.
[13:25:41] <SunsparcSolaris> shoky: Is this the correct syntax?
[13:25:43] <SunsparcSolaris> $( "#accordion" ).accordion({       collapsible: true     }); ({active: false});   });
[13:26:09] <aboba> doubt it
[13:26:15] <aboba> even though I dont know what you're doing
[13:26:20] <tristan1990> duch_kazatel Do you think I need to use another method then?
[13:26:20] <aboba> the semi-colons feel wrong
[13:26:28] <duch_kazatel>  ({active: false});   }); that looks wrong.
[13:26:56] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 i can't see anywhere that shows you how to access object properties using this plugin.
[13:27:11] <tristan1990> Okay. Do you know of any that do?
[13:27:19] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:29:06] <duch_kazatel> you may have to traipse through the data that gets returned, but I'm not sure how exactly you'd do that.,
[13:30:32] <SunsparcSolaris> duch_kazatel: suggestions?
[13:31:14] <SunsparcSolaris> Nevermind, duch_kazatel I figured it out
[13:31:17] <SunsparcSolaris> Thanks!
[13:31:21] <duch_kazatel> i was about to say ;)
[13:32:27] <decx> tristan1990 http://jsfiddle.net/7cJhA/8/
[13:32:36] <SunsparcSolaris> I was missing the comma between the options
[13:32:50] <decx> my edit starts at line 436
[13:32:53] <duch_kazatel> SunsparcSolaris your entire format was also wrong.
[13:33:01] <duch_kazatel> decx that's a plugin they found elsehwere btw.
[13:33:16] <decx> yeah i know
[13:33:26] <decx> but quick fix is better than nothing
[13:33:27] <decx> ;)
[13:33:39] <duch_kazatel> wonder why this plugin doesn't give you the option to directly access the data that comes back.,
[13:33:59] <decx> because it's for searching places and doesn't need to deal with objects
[13:34:12] <duch_kazatel> but it has the option of displaying data about those places.
[13:34:26] <tristan1990> Cool. When I test it I get - undefined1100090009000900090009000900
[13:34:27] <BillCriswell> Cycling through arrays I'd always reset the counter to 0 when I hit the arrays length, just occured to me I can do arrays[ counter % arrays.length ]
[13:35:18] <decx> tristan1990 yeah i just grabbed a couple of elements from the value object for demonstration. you can do the boring stuff youself ;)
[13:36:05] <tristan1990> Ahh, so I can modify what you did to select the opening hours :) ?
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> tristan1990 yeah, you'll have to monkeypatch the plugin yourself.
[13:36:52] <tristan1990> Thanks guys. btw - what does monkeypatch mean?
[13:36:54] <decx> console.log(value.periods[key]) to take a look at the object and what you can access in there
[13:37:01] <decx> inside that for loop
[13:37:13] <tristan1990> cool
[13:39:04] <tristan1990> Thanks all
[13:39:31] <decx> or just check value.open_now to display either open or closed ;)
[13:39:54] <tristan1990> Awesome, is that on version 8?
[13:40:07] <decx> no
[13:40:09] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/7cJhA/9/

[13:46:41] <duch_kazatel> what's up with the pastes in the channel?
[13:47:12] <sureshscribnar> sorry, new to the channel
[13:47:17] <duch_kazatel> are you simply looking for a description of what $.extend() does?
[13:47:38] <sureshscribnar> no, I know that it combines multiple objects in to one and returns…
[13:47:55] <duch_kazatel> okay, then what's the question?
[13:47:57] <sureshscribnar> the library I am referring to passes just one object to extend a
[13:48:19] <sureshscribnar> and I wonder if its done to add the property to jQuery?
[13:50:27] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.extend/#jQuery-extend-target-object1-objectN
[13:50:31] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:52:58] <sureshscribnar> duch_kazatel, The library I mentioned just passes single argument, so I wonder what happens when you do like that.
[13:53:11] <duch_kazatel> sureshscribnar right - did you look at the link I pasteD?
[13:53:19] <duch_kazatel> "An object that will receive the new properties if additional objects are passed in or that will extend the jQuery namespace if it is the sole argument."
[13:53:28] <decx> basicly it extends $
[13:53:55] <sureshscribnar> ok thanks, that was what I was looking for, a confirmation… I missed the text “that will extend the jQuery namespace if it is the sole argument.”.
[13:53:56] <sureshscribnar> :-)
[13:53:59] <duch_kazatel> if you only supply extend with a single object, it extends the jquery namespace.
[13:54:44] <sureshscribnar> ok thanks
[13:55:06] <decx> i wonder if there's a benefit compared to $.fn.name = function
[13:55:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm sure, buried deep somewhere, there's a discussion about the different approaches and why one is more right than the others or wahtever.
[13:55:45] <decx> hehe
[13:56:06] <sureshscribnar> if we use extend with property name say, bullet then it can be called $.bullet
[13:56:21] <sureshscribnar> How should we call a function if its assigned using  $.fn.name = function
[13:56:22] <sureshscribnar> ?
[13:56:38] <sureshscribnar> $.fun.name(); ?
[13:56:38] <decx> $.name
[13:56:46] <duch_kazatel> $('aninja').name();
[13:57:00] <snover> “fn” is a retarded alias for prototype
[13:57:19] <duch_kazatel> that's not an alias for prototype, is it?
[13:57:25] <snover> yes
[13:57:29] <duch_kazatel> i thought that was for function?
[13:57:31] <snover> jQuery.prototype is $.fn
[13:57:32] <decx> what else would it be
[13:57:54] <decx> who would want to write prototype all the time anyway ^^
[13:58:07] <duch_kazatel> i thought that's where it stores all the functions.  mind blown apparently.
[13:58:19] <sureshscribnar> thanks
[13:58:22] <snover> jQuery is actually a constructor function
[13:58:26] <decx> it does
[13:58:27] <duch_kazatel> yeah i knew that.
[13:58:43] <duch_kazatel> but .fn is just an alias for prototype?
[13:58:51] <sureshscribnar> yes
[13:58:58] <duch_kazatel> weird.
[13:58:59] <sureshscribnar> based on what i learn now

[14:13:19] <waseem_> Hi I've attached a 'keydown' event to body element of my page and am trying to call a handler function on the same event. The event object that is passed to the handler function is the integer keycode value instead of an eventObject as mentioned in the documentation. Here's the code in coffeescript. https://gist.github.com/waseem/10682931 Please let me know if you need any more details.
[14:13:41] <duch_kazatel> can you give it in javascript please?
[14:14:09] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: Yest just a minute.
[14:17:26] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: It's a long piece of code. This is where I attache the event. https://gist.github.com/waseem/10682931#file-widget_layer-js-L39
[14:17:44] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: And this is the function https://gist.github.com/waseem/10682931#file-widget_layer-js-L233
[14:18:54] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ you're binding using WidgetLayer.prototype.onKeyDown - what documentation are you referring to?
[14:19:01] <Voyage> how to have <br /> in tooltip like here  http://www.bootply.com/129984 but by jquery?
[14:19:24] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: I'm using 1.8.3
[14:19:38] <duch_kazatel> Voyage edit the title attribute.
[14:19:45] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: And referring to https://api.jquery.com/on/ and https://api.jquery.com/keydown/
[14:19:46] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ the function you are calling is not a jquery function.
[14:19:57] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn onkeydown

[14:20:09] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  https://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#default
[14:20:29] <duch_kazatel> Voyage $('selector').attr('title', 'a new title here');
[14:21:04] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  ya but  cant I just output it (thats what my server side logic does)
[14:21:12] <duch_kazatel> Voyage huh?
[14:21:17] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: Okay. Does that mean $('body') is not a jQuery object there?
[14:21:44] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ sorry, reading again, but your code is very... strange.
[14:21:59] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  I am outputing the title programatically. I cant change it with some $selector
[14:22:12] <duch_kazatel> Voyage on what element?
[14:22:20] <duch_kazatel> Voyage you have to target the element somehow...
[14:22:20] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  In short, how to do this http://www.bootply.com/129984
[14:22:41] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  no. I meant like $("[data-toggle=tooltip]").tooltip({html:true});
[14:22:54] <Voyage> <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="right" title="This tooltip is on the &lt;br/&gt;right!">Hover over me</a>
[14:23:02] <duch_kazatel> Voyage i'm not blind.
[14:23:08] <duch_kazatel> Voyage $("[data-toggle=tooltip]").attr('title', 'new title here');
[14:23:44] <decx> either use jquery ui or make your own tooltip function
[14:23:55] <duch_kazatel> or edit the title attribute before you init.
[14:24:02] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  I am echoing / printing the title wit server side loops. I cant just do $("[data-toggle=tooltip]").attr('title', 'new title here');
[14:24:12] <duch_kazatel> Voyage huh?
[14:24:24] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  why edit. why not just hard code it?
[14:24:27] <duch_kazatel> Voyage you mean you want to edit the existing title?
[14:24:33] <Voyage> NO
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> Voyage i have no idea what you want to do apparently.
[14:24:42] <Voyage> I do not want to edit the title
[14:24:50] <Voyage> just display it with a <br />
[14:24:59] <decx> Voyage http://jsfiddle.net/9dfGT/
[14:25:01] <Voyage> the title is already the part of html
[14:25:39] <decx> there's also a plethora of tooltip plugins you can use
[14:26:02] <duch_kazatel> Voyage right, you need to insert your linebreak. that requires editing the title.  are you doing this to limit the width of the tooltip?
[14:26:27] <decx> he just wants a tooltip like bootstrap without bootstrap
[14:26:56] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand why he needs an arbitrary linebreak.
[14:26:58] <shoky> decx your fiddle actually doesn't work with newer jqui
[14:27:03] <duch_kazatel> that's why i'm confused.
[14:27:19] <decx> oh it doesnt?
[14:27:37] <decx> nice
[14:27:40] <Voyage> duch_kazatel,  no. just a new line
[14:27:55] <Voyage> decx,  http://jsfiddle.net/9dfGT/  how did you got it working. it doesnt works with me
[14:28:10] <shoky> Voyage: it doesn't work with newer jquery-ui
[14:28:19] <Voyage> ..........
[14:28:20] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ i can't see what the issue is with your code - have you tried not using coffeescript and doing a plain old $('body').on('keydown', function(e){ console.log(e) });
[14:28:21] <shoky> Voyage: here's one workaround.. http://jsfiddle.net/2LZyL/
[14:29:09] <shoky> Voyage: whoops i meant to link it with the newer jqui  http://jsfiddle.net/2LZyL/1/
[14:29:17] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: I could, yes. I also tried renaming the function to something else. The handler is not attached in that case. Apparently onKeyDown has some special meaning. The one you pointed to apparently.
[14:29:22] <Voyage> shoky,  decx  well i also had 1.9.2 on my system. it shows <br> in the title while the fiddle decx  showed displays a line break
[14:29:23] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers.onkeydown
[14:29:35] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ yes, it does.  try renaming the function too.
[14:29:48] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: But surprisingly, $('body') is a jQuery object.
[14:29:57] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: I wonder why event wont attach to it.
[14:29:58] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ that's not surprising...
[14:30:01] <decx> ah so the direct return overrides the sanitation shoky clever
[14:30:23] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ are you stopping propagation or anything?
[14:30:40] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: Inside the handler, yes.
[14:30:46] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: But it's not even called.
[14:31:19] <duch_kazatel> waseem_ try the code i posted and see if that works first.
[14:31:40] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: Sure, lemme try. Thanks for your help so far.
[14:31:48] <shoky> Voyage: that sounds odd because they onnly made that change since jquery-ui 1.10 as far as i can tell
[14:31:56] <Voyage> shoky,  decx  I didnt got it. why its working in fiddle and not fo rme
[14:32:18] <decx> blame canada
[14:32:22] <shoky> Voyage it doesn't work even with my workaround?
[14:32:56] <Voyage> shoky,  didnt tried work around yet.
[14:33:00] <waseem_> duch_kazatel: It does not work.
[14:33:07] <Voyage> just confused on the http://jsfiddle.net/9dfGT/1/
[14:34:12] <shoky> well something is different in what you're doing than from the fiddle
[14:38:33] <Voyage> shoky, decx  http://oi61.tinypic.com/4rau14.jpg
[14:39:32] <shoky> that doesn't really help us find it, Voyage
[14:39:58] <Voyage>  <script src="/resources/scripts/jquery-ui-1.10.3/ui/minified/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
[14:40:04] <mariuscc> guys any clue if I can call init manually here ?  http://jsfiddle.net/SC7VH/
[14:40:16] <shoky> Voyage: you said you're using 1.9.2
[14:40:19] <Voyage> shoky,  so thats the issue?
[14:40:30] <shoky> yes, that's what i've been saying
[14:40:38] <decx> you didnt even try the workaround
[14:40:45] <Voyage> shoky,  I really though I was , but then I checked again.
[14:40:55] <Voyage> decx,  shoky  ofcourse, I will try it now
[14:40:56] <duch_kazatel> mariuscc inside of text, yes.
[14:41:01] <duch_kazatel> *test
[14:41:01] <Voyage> the work around^
[14:41:13] <decx> yeah don't be a help vampire :>
[14:41:18] <mariuscc> not inside, outside
[14:41:20] <mariuscc> duch_kazatel
[14:41:26] <duch_kazatel> mariuscc nope.
[14:41:45] <mariuscc> duch_kazatel: so init will be triggered only when loaded ?
[14:41:47] <duch_kazatel> unless somebody knows something i don't about accessing vars inside a function from outside a function.
[14:42:33] <mariuscc> I'm not sure if I can call test function again.
[14:42:47] <duch_kazatel> !g mdn scope
[14:42:49] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Functions and function scope - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[14:43:06] <duch_kazatel> i'd read that to get a grasp on what's going on here.
[14:45:06] <Voyage> shoky, decx  so I wont need  $(".tooltip").tooltip();    but  $(document).tooltip({       content: function() {            return $(this).attr('title');       }  });     and it will auto make all the elements with "title" attr as tool tips?
[14:45:30] <shoky> Voyage: yeah. you can leave it $(".tooltip") instead of $(document) if you want
[14:45:45] <shoky> if all your tooltipped items have tooltip class
[14:45:48] <shoky> i gues
[14:45:49] <shoky> s
[14:45:55] <Voyage> yes
[14:47:26] <Voyage> works. thanks!
[14:47:41] <Voyage> shoky,  decx  I wonder why so much changes in jQuery versions. should be consistant
[14:48:17] <duch_kazatel> jquery 1.9 had some big changes, but that was the last major one.
[14:48:46] <sqlnoob> I've added a <select> element to a div via jquery dynamically. Now when trying to create new select element based on the value of first select element, I don't have success. Does it have to do anything with DOM creation?
[14:49:10] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ sqlnoob
[14:49:10] <b-ot> sqlnoob: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:50:37] <sqlnoob> got it. it was my mistake
[14:50:44] <duch_kazatel> sqlnoob okay.
[14:50:57] <sqlnoob> thanks though duch_kazatel
[14:51:06] <duch_kazatel> of course;.
[14:58:43] <Technodrome> i have a few theory questions
[14:59:17] <Technodrome> when you are creating a multi step form for instance, what are you doing, hiding div’s and showing one , then another, or are you injecting it into the markup , how is this accomplished?
[14:59:36] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you mean by "multi step form"
[14:59:53] <Technodrome> like you know, ajax multi step form
[15:00:24] <Technodrome> is that part replaced, or is the other hidden and then the other displayed
[15:00:26] <duch_kazatel> still not following - "multi step" can mean all kinds of things.  I assume you have "pages" you fill out?
[15:00:30] <Technodrome> thats why i said it’s more of a theory question
[15:00:40] <Technodrome> say a 4 step form, common on say amazon
[15:00:50] <duch_kazatel> those aren't ajax.
[15:02:01] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: ok pretend they are :)
[15:02:57] <decx> haha duch_kazatel sometimes you're such a damn korinthenkacker
[15:03:27] <duch_kazatel> decx i just don't get what he wants.  nothing he's described necessitates AJAX.
[15:03:55] <duch_kazatel> saying "like amazon" and then not actually meaning that is strange.
[15:04:13] <Technodrome> amazon has order forms, amazon payments which just fire ajax request
[15:04:24] <Technodrome> i just went along with what you said
[15:04:33] <decx> it's common to put it all on one page, hide stuff and send your stuff partially for what you want
[15:04:46] <Technodrome> i’m asking a theory / implementation question, you know what i’m looking for
[15:04:48] <Technodrome> decx: yes
[15:05:00] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome i really didn't know what you were looking for.
[15:05:04] <Technodrome> so all the html is there, you are just hiding what you don’t want shown decx  ?
[15:05:05] <duch_kazatel> but sounds like decx knows.
[15:05:56] <duch_kazatel> normally, that's what you'd do Technodrome.  i'd suggest making sure you have a good fallback for when things break, too.
[15:06:21] <decx> it's only really applicable if you have fixed steps, but in ecommerce a lot can change depending on the size of your cart, your location your payment. so it's more common to get that stuff from your server
[15:06:31] <Technodrome> basically i have one form, i would like to split up into 4 steps
[15:06:41] <decx> and not have a multi step form like in bootstrap or whereever it was
[15:07:29] <Technodrome> this is a simple thing really, i was going to use django’s multi step stuff, it saves everything in a temporary table etc
[15:07:39] <Technodrome> but i was thinking, i could just use one form , and use jquery to split it up
[15:07:45] <tucan> im trying to follow the docs for Respond.js to use CDN/X-Domain but not really understanding this whole process of using a proxy page, could anyone explain it better?
[15:07:50] <decx> well it's still multiple forms
[15:08:43] <Technodrome> i understand there is many ways of dealing with this
[15:09:01] <Technodrome> decx: i guess in essence a multi step ajax form, works the same as a slider or content “slider” right?
[15:09:09] <Technodrome> hiding a dev, showing a dev etc
[15:09:10] <Technodrome> div*
[15:09:51] <duch_kazatel> I'd either validate each input as the user leaves it or on click for the next "step"
[15:09:57] <duch_kazatel> *leaves each input.
[15:11:36] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: well for the first step I’m doing that right now
[15:11:59] <Technodrome> server side validation
[15:12:03] <duch_kazatel> then show the next step (which should all ready be on the page) when that's successful.
[15:12:19] <Technodrome> yes , using jquery right? Like unhiding the div?
[15:12:34] <duch_kazatel> or adding/removing a class.
[15:12:41] <Technodrome> see my question was the theory, i thought all these content sliders worked by “injecting” html when you click next etc
[15:12:50] <duch_kazatel> you could also do it that way.
[15:12:57] <duch_kazatel> really depends on what you're doing and your needs.
[15:13:03] <Technodrome> so i was looking for a best practice
[15:13:14] <Technodrome> seems like the hide / unhide is the most popular way?
[15:13:16] <duch_kazatel> tucan what are you looking for?
[15:13:52] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome i'd probably consider ajaxing in the next page if the steps are large enough, but i'm not entirely sure.
[15:14:02] <Technodrome> its a small form really
[15:14:15] <Technodrome> but one step is needed to be validated before one moves on
[15:14:27] <Technodrome> i got that already
[15:14:38] <duch_kazatel> if nothing will change through each step, i'd have it all on the same page and show/hide with javascript.
[15:14:40] <Technodrome> i was just looking for how these sliders / multi step thigns work
[15:15:09] <Technodrome> http://www.jquery-steps.com/Examples
[15:15:12] <Technodrome> first basic example
[15:15:17] <walidvb> anyone got a good, reliable touch sensitive, nestable slider?
[15:15:17] <Technodrome> that’s pretty much what I’m doing
[15:15:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah, that's not ajaxing anything.
[15:15:32] <duch_kazatel> those are all on the page.
[15:15:35] <Technodrome> yes
[15:15:39] <duch_kazatel> most carousels do the same.
[15:15:42] <Technodrome> sorry forget ajax right now
[15:15:42] <Technodrome> yes
[15:15:49] <Technodrome> its all there, they just hide / unhide?
[15:15:57] <duch_kazatel> in those cases, yes
[15:16:02] <walidvb> in most
[15:16:14] <Technodrome> what are other ways they are implemented?
[15:16:27] <duch_kazatel> for carousels specifically, that's about it.
[15:17:51] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: did they always work that way?
[15:17:58] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome carousels?  yes.
[15:18:12] <duch_kazatel> a simple carousel need ajax seems a little heavy-handed.
[15:18:18] <duch_kazatel> *needing
[15:21:27] <sqlnoob> Is it possible to bind an event for creation and change of an element inside DOM via jquery?
[15:21:49] <duch_kazatel> sqlnoob there are ways to do that, but they're very slow.
[15:22:52] <sqlnoob> duch_kazatel: is it so? then, how would I update multiple select elements based on each other's value? All select elements are dynamically created in my case.
[15:23:21] <duch_kazatel> sqlnoob by using event delegation instead.
[15:23:47] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() { /* your code here */ });
[15:24:17] <duch_kazatel> where parent is an element that is a common, shared ancestor for your selects, and child is the element you want to trigger on events from
[15:24:30] <duch_kazatel> in your case, child will likely be something like select
[15:24:44] <sqlnoob> oh okay so like body can be a common element?
[15:24:55] <duch_kazatel> sure, but try to bound further down if at all possible.
[15:25:16] <sqlnoob> such that DOM traversals are low as much as possible
[15:25:33] <duch_kazatel> actually, no.
[15:25:50] <duch_kazatel> it's to reduce the number of events you're filtering.
[15:25:55] <duch_kazatel> that syntax uses event delegation.
[15:26:04] <duch_kazatel> !g javascript event delegation
[15:26:06] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: How JavaScript Event Delegation Works - David Walsh → http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate
[15:26:31] <duch_kazatel> this article uses plain old javascript for its examples, but should give you a good idea of the concept.
[15:26:35] <sqlnoob> thanks I'll have a read
[15:26:46] <decx> it's not a traversal but you've got the right idea sqlnoob
[15:27:49] <tucan> duch_kazatel: just trying to fix a Bootstrap 3 site for IE8  but it says Respond.js must work with local css file.  not sure how cross domain works and why there needs to a proxy gif + proxy html page
[15:28:38] <duch_kazatel> tucan i'll bet it's because it doesn't call CDNs
[15:28:43] <duch_kazatel> cross-domain issues.
[15:28:54] <duch_kazatel> so your backend needs to call the css file and serve it up.
[15:30:54] <tucan> not really understanding to be honest, i looked at some of these SO pages http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14738247/respond-js-cdn-x-domain-setup
[15:31:26] <tucan> 'This is how I got it working, remote refers to a remote-url and local to a local asset.'
[15:31:30] <tucan> what does that mean?
[15:32:21] <walidvb> sqlnoob
[15:32:45] <duch_kazatel> the remote urls are the CDN and the local urls are the local urls.
[15:33:16] <duch_kazatel> tucan http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14564079/respond-js-not-working-cross-domain
[15:35:25] <decx> all that crap, just to emulate some include behaviour. what's wrong with script tags :(
[15:36:48] <tucan> duch_kazatel: i'll give that a try but it's still bit confusing for me, why is a proxy gif used
[15:42:14] <duch_kazatel> tucan no clue.  i'd have to look through their source.,

Here is how it looks for now : http://beat-scout.com/beta/public
[15:51:24] <duch_kazatel> House how are you handling popstates?
[15:52:34] <duch_kazatel> House you're pushing things into the history, but then not handling the popstate event.

[15:53:18] <House> ?
[15:53:33] <duch_kazatel> House this isn't an ajax thing, it's a popstate thing.
[15:53:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to read the article i just linke.d
[15:53:50] <House> Ok will do, thanks
[15:54:10] <duch_kazatel> the short of it is that you need to listen to window.onpopstate and have that function run your logic.

[19:51:51] <AlbertSpeer> and "show more" when i close
[19:51:55] <AlbertSpeer> im just starting to leanr jquery
[19:54:00] <ManyouRisms> http://jsfiddle.net/CqYrH/10/
[19:54:07] <ManyouRisms> you are combining jquery and javascript
[19:54:37] <ManyouRisms> if you are returning a javascript object ( ie by using elem = $(this) then you'll want to use the jquery function .text()
[19:54:54] <ManyouRisms> javascript object i mean jquery object

[23:17:52] <Patvil> how do I get the 'value' from and url like www.sub.domain.com/value
[23:20:33] <ravenzz> Patvil you may want to use a library to parse URLs
[23:21:14] <ravenzz> if you are confident that your string will be always like that you can split by /
[23:21:57] <Patvil> Let me explain a bit more what I am after
[23:22:20] <ravenzz> sure
[23:22:57] <Patvil> this script will run on every page, can't do anything about that unfortunately, so what I want to do is start the stricpt by identifying what page the visitor is on.
[23:23:17] <Patvil> Since I only want the script to be run at one specific page
[23:23:45] <Patvil> so yes I know that atleast for that specific page the url will always look like that
[23:24:40] <Patvil> makes sense? or is there another better way to do this?
[23:25:08] <Patvil> basically a script that will always load on every page should only be run at one specific page
[23:25:38] <ravenzz> oh that's kinda awful. anyway in this case you can compare your string to window.location.pathname
[23:26:20] <ravenzz> maybe you can make a function that checks for a matches
[23:26:29] <ravenzz> let me show a pof
[23:27:10] <Patvil> It's for a hosted service, can't manipulate the files in anyway, but they allow me to enter javascripts, but they will run on all pages... :/
[23:27:22] <Patvil> sure, thanks
[23:32:06] <ravenzz> are you using jQuery?
[23:32:14] <ravenzz> Patvil ^
[23:33:04] <Patvil> I am yes
[23:36:19] <teitoklein01> Hi guys, we have this javascript/jquery driven website that do not require refresh to update and get data. but the thing is, to make it real time we need to poll every x seconds specific methods to update each templates with the new data
[23:36:25] <teitoklein01> and it ends up making the website slow
[23:37:04] <teitoklein01> is there any appropriate way to implement real time functionalities to a javascript driven website?
[23:37:10] <teitoklein01> we developed it using php/js
[23:37:28] <Cork> teitoklein01: look into websocket
[23:37:47] <Cork> it lets you push data to the client
[23:38:06] <Cork> teitoklein01: if updating is slow it might be cause of how you update the content
[23:39:33] <teitoklein01> i'm not the first developer, but it seems that the update goes around $.ajaxing(GET) data from the database, updating html elements with it, cloning, looping, and displaying .
[23:40:12] <Cork> teitoklein01: is the ajax call synchronous?
[23:40:17] <Cork> (async: false)
[23:40:59] <teitoklein01> hmmm based on firebug, yes. and each call is around500-800ms each
[23:41:12] <Cork> then you have your reason
[23:41:16] <ravenzz> Patvil I'm back, sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/V7PL3/
[23:41:24] <Cork> the page freezes every time you fetch you data from the server
[23:42:05] <teitoklein01> yes . seems like that. specially when I have multiple tabs open in my browser
[23:42:21] <teitoklein01> is it advisable to use sockets? or am I just need to refactor the code?
[23:42:22] <Cork> teitoklein01: so you're faced with a quite significant rewrite
[23:42:35] <teitoklein01> oh ths is what I'm scared of :s
[23:42:37] <Cork> teitoklein01: well if you can get your server to support websocket
[23:42:48] <Cork> but it is async by nature
[23:42:58] <Cork> so what ever way you go you'll have to fix that
[23:43:08] <Cork> and if you fix it, you can keep using the ajax solution
[23:43:34] <Cork> if the page freezes for one second every fetch you will have a nasty experience
[23:43:51] <Cork> (note never use sync ajax calls)
[23:44:10] <Cork> the only use case for it is getting blocked in browsers
[23:44:56] <teitoklein01> Oh okay, I better check the code if something nasty is happening ..
[23:45:17] <teitoklein01> it's 16,000 lines oh well. I'm ducked
[23:45:28] <Cork> teitoklein01: you will have refactoring to do
[23:45:37] <Patvil> ravenzz, looks complicated, which probably means it's good :)
[23:45:40] <Cork> sync ajax means the code stops until a response comes back
[23:45:53] <Cork> teitoklein01: so you can return the response from a function for example
[23:46:10] <Cork> teitoklein01: that isn't possible with async, you need to use callbacks there
[23:46:28] <Cork> so all the code handling the response from the ajax call most likely needs to be updated
[23:46:51] <ravenzz> Patvil nah, the idea is that you can have a json encoded string in your html containing all the allowed path (this allows you to control that from the server/backend)
[23:46:58] <teitoklein01> it seems that all the ajax calls have response. a json one
[23:47:16] <teitoklein01> if you don't include the async property by default, what is the value?
[23:47:17] <teitoklein01> false?
[23:47:24] <Patvil> ravenzz, can't I just use if(window.location.pathname == 'string'){ $jquery script.... }
[23:47:35] <ravenzz> Patvil yes you can
[23:48:01] <Cork> teitoklein01: if you don't set async: false it defaults to true
[23:48:41] <Patvil> ravenzz, for your solution, do I need to edit the html files aswell?
[23:49:06] <ravenzz> Patvil you should have that hidden input, yes
[23:49:18] <Patvil> ravenzz, because since this is a hosted service, All I can to is create javascripts...
[23:49:21] <teitoklein01> oh i c.
[23:50:36] <teitoklein01> Cork: but how do famous javascript websites make their website so perfect for user experience and at the same time realtime? for example websites like asana or some other web-based project management tools
[23:51:08] <Patvil> ravenzz, I have no access to the pages unfortunately, or to the forms on the pages, that why I need to customize it using javascript :/
[23:51:09] <Cork> teitoklein01: they don't use sync ajax calls for a starter :)
[23:51:27] <Cork> teitoklein01: and they make sure to reduce the reflow in the page
[23:51:35] <teitoklein01> Cork: but still they poll every x seconds ? but async?
[23:51:50] <Cork> teitoklein01: some do every second yes
[23:52:08] <failwell> noone uses snychronized ajax calls.. isn't it even impossible nowadays to make something else than an async call?
[23:52:12] <Cork> those are normally referred to as comet solutions
[23:52:22] <Cork> failwell: it has always been
[23:52:29] <Cork> that is the point of sync ajax calls
[23:52:49] <failwell> as we are in jquey - i thought sync ajax was removed from jquery?
[23:52:49] <Cork> the pages time stops until the response comes back from the server
[23:53:01] <Cork> failwell: it isn't
[23:53:12] <Cork> failwell: it is marked deprecated though
[23:53:58] <failwell> indeed.. it's only deprecated..
[23:53:59] <failwell> :D
[23:54:06] <failwell> As of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated;
[23:54:46] <Cork> failwell: i kinda doubt they will actually remove the support though
[23:54:47] <failwell> teitoklein01: comet is a good hint.. you might also look into websockets
[23:55:02] <Cork> failwell: i've already told him this :)
[23:55:20] <Cork> but what ever route he goes we will have to convert his sync code to async
[23:55:31] <Cork> so he has quite a bit of recoding to do
[23:55:35] <failwell> unfortunately websockets is still only a draft - i'm waiting for this since 3 years to finish.. *.*
[23:55:49] <Cork> failwell: uh, no
[23:55:54] <teitoklein01> I'm actually reading some stackoverflow threads right now. it's pretty interesting . I'll come back after I read it and ask for some questions.
[23:55:58] <Cork> websocket has been stable for quite some time
[23:56:01] <teitoklein01> Thanks Cork :)
[23:57:45] <failwell> cork: maybe.. i'm not sure. browser support still lacks for websockets. it already got better in last year.
[23:57:45] <teitoklein01> there are many async:false properties on the code :(
[23:57:55] <teitoklein01> i don't why they used it
[23:58:02] <Cork> failwell: support is cross browser
[23:58:12] <Cork> failwell: only pitfall is older ies
[23:58:23] <Cork> more exactly ie9
[23:58:55] <failwell> did last tests summer last year.. my firefox back then had to be activated for websockets by internal settings.. so i stopped looking for till now. lemme see. would be great
[23:59:26] <Cork> failwell: i have two projects that use it actively :)
[23:59:56] <teitoklein01> they are talking about this thing long-polling. what is the difference of long-polling to polling only
