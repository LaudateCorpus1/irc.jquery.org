[10:19:32] <sbs> hi
[10:20:03] <sbs> is there a smart way of changing a bootstrap alert type without using local variables or complex jquery selection?
[10:20:36] <sbs> ie I want to use an alert to display information, and change the style of the alert depending on context
[10:21:09] <sbs> removeclasse(oldstyle) addclass(newstyle) does it but requires storing somewhere the previous class type. Suggestion ?
[13:09:02] <robsco> I've created an evenhandler on('click') on a button in a bootstrap modal, which I understand receives the event object.  from that I'd like to find() the modal element again.  i tried e.target.find() but no joy, what am I doing wrong?
[13:09:26] <robsco> e.target.find('.modal')
[13:13:11] <robsco> i know I can use $(this) inside the handler, but interested to know why e.target.find() isn't working
[13:15:37] <shoky> robsco: e.target is a raw DOM element, not wrapped in a jquery object, so it doesn't have a .find method.  also,  .find() is for finding descendants, not ancestors. sounds like you want .closest('.modal') or something
[13:21:18] <robsco> shoky, thanks, i've gone with parents() for now, but is there a way to convert the raw DOM element to a jquery one?
[13:21:42] <shoky> robsco: the same way you did it with `this`,  wrap it with $( )
[13:23:10] <robsco> hmm, thought I tried that, will give it another go
[15:08:02] <DelphiWorld> hey dudes
[15:08:11] <DelphiWorld> is jquery mobile still in life? or deprecated
[16:29:27] <ThijsW> Hi all, I have a question: is there a way to hide a page or direct to a other page (after login I still see the login screen when i hit the back button)
[16:32:28] <pavonia> You could make the login a dynamic div over the original page
[16:41:08] <ThijsW> not sure how to do that, does it work with the 1st page?
[16:45:48] <pavonia> If the user clicks on the link to the login page, instead of redirecting to another site, you just display a new div on top of the current page
[16:46:21] <pavonia> So the login "page" never goes into the user's history
[16:52:31] <ThijsW> ok, and what if the login is the first page so there is no link to that page?
[16:54:09] <ThijsW> I wan't to use a index.html with 2 pages inside for register and login, and then another file.html for the rest of the app. so that latest file is the homescreen. but I can't get my login link work from the index.html to another file.html
[16:54:32] <ThijsW> I think if i can fix that it will work to.
[16:55:19] <ThijsW> my login javascript directs to a page when username and password are correct:
[16:55:45] <ThijsW> window.location.href = "#page3";
[16:56:13] <ThijsW> this code works when I use a multipage document (1 document with multiple pages inside the body)
[16:56:47] <ThijsW> but I can't get it work with and external link like "page3.html"
[16:58:29] <pavonia> Try window.location.replace(...)
[17:02:01] <ThijsW> that doesn't work on android as an app
[17:02:02] <ThijsW> I
[17:02:13] <ThijsW> I'm getting a error file not found
[17:04:16] <pavonia> Oh, I don't know about Android
[17:25:46] <ThijsW> maybe I should remove the login page from history?
[18:00:32] <tariqali> Hey, er, I…like jQuery.
[18:00:57] <_Tariq> So I’m wondering what are good arguments for me to keep using jQuery though.
[18:01:13] <_Tariq> So that if someone asks me why I don’t use vanilla JS, I could respond.
