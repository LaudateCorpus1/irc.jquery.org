[00:00:30] <granden_> One more thing that has been troubling me is thoes uperselector and selector in this case. As I got like this <ul id="ingredients"><li><span><a class='remove'>Remove</a></span></li>
[00:00:53] <granden_> would $('ul#ingredients').delegate('a.remove', 'click', function(){
[00:00:55] <granden_> be enough
[00:01:21] <granden_> I mean a.remove is not a direct child to ul#ingredients
[00:01:34] <Cork> granden_: never ever put an element tag name before an id
[00:01:47] <Cork> it take a fast selector and makes it slow
[00:01:51] <granden_> Ok
[00:01:56] <granden_> Thanks for that input
[00:02:05] <Cork> and yes that will work
[00:02:17] <Cork> $('#ingredients').delegate('.remove', 'click', function(){})
[00:02:41] <granden_> I know this is not a #css channel. But, does the same apply to my css stylesheets not having ul#ingredients ?
[00:02:49] <Cork> yes
[00:03:09] <Cork> ul#id forces the browser to select all ul's in the page, and the match on the id
[00:03:23] <granden_> ok
[00:03:24] <granden_> great
[00:03:26] <Cork> and that is pointless as the id is uniq, and can never exist on more then one element
[00:03:35] <Cork> element.class is of, and often needed
[00:03:42] <Cork> of==ok
[00:04:32] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:04:32] <granden_> Hmm that wont work either.
[00:04:42] <granden_> Must be some other problem then my delegate/on thing then.
[00:05:20] <Cork> damn... interesting...
[00:05:57] <chrisTech> What's wrong with this script? http://jsfiddle.net/e8pTR/
[00:06:19] <Cork> $('#1-foo, #2-foo') is more then 12 times slower then $('#1-foo').add('#2-foo')
[00:06:55] <Cork> chrisTech: http://jsfiddle.net/e8pTR/1/
[00:08:47] <chrisTech> Cork, thanks, I just realized I didn't choose a jquery library. :)
[00:15:28] <granden_> Is there any selector to catch all elements with a specific data- attribute?
[00:19:42] <erickubenka> granden_ try $("div[data-myattr='myvalue']") ;
[00:20:44] <erickubenka> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[00:21:49] <AAlien> bare [data-myattr] also works, regardless of "myvalue"
[00:22:20] <AAlien> and regardless of element type
[00:22:30] <AAlien> so $('[data-myattr]')
[00:23:00] <erickubenka> ahhh yeah.
[00:29:03] <granden_> AAlien: and erickubenka Thank you both a lot!
[00:35:51] <chrisTech> What's wrong with this script? http://jsfiddle.net/5E5X7/1/
[00:39:03] <Cork> uh.. you can't add any elements inside an input element
[00:39:17] <Cork> chrisTech: ^
[00:39:43] <chrisTech> Cork, that adds it inside? I was aiming for after the input. How do I do that? :)
[00:41:46] <Cork> ?.after
[00:41:47] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[00:42:27] <chrisTech> Cork, you made my day. Thank you! :)
[00:51:06] <bloopletech> I think I'm going mad. I've got a completely ordinary jquery ready event, and the code never runs. This is the code block - whacked in the <head>: https://gist.github.com/bloopletech/5668629. Running jquery 1.8.3, HTML is   <a href="#" id="expand-copyrights">More copyright information...</a> <div id="extended-copyrights">...</div>
[00:51:51] <Happzz> hi. i use PJAX to navigate most of the time between pages. now, if i go to another page, and then go back using the browser's back button (firefox, latest), it won't really LOAD the previous page
[00:51:54] <unnu> empty link
[00:52:01] <Happzz> but only restore the previous back
[00:52:01] <Cork> bloopletech: do you have the jquery lib loaded?
[00:52:08] <Happzz> and i lose some critical JS code
[00:52:17] <Happzz> that binds on page load
[00:52:38] <bloopletech> Cork: head has <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js"></script>, seems to be working
[00:52:47] <unnu> Cork, thanks for your help the other day . . . my page is almost done . . . works great :D i super appreciate it
[00:54:07] <Cork> bloopletech: any errors in the browser console?
[00:55:12] <bloopletech> I get an error from flot, some ghostery errors (unrelated I think, ghostery is a chrome extension), and a warning from some facebook widget the page uses
[00:55:28] <Happzz> after a little debugging, i found that $(document).ready() isn't executed after the back button is hit
[00:55:30] <Cork> bloopletech: js errors?
[00:55:32] <bloopletech> nothing that jumps out at me straight away. I'll push this page up and link it
[00:55:48] <Cork> bloopletech: if you get js errors, that means the execution in the page load gets stopped
[00:55:56] <Cork> and is prob what causes the problem
[00:56:36] <Cork> Happzz: browsers hold the page in cache when you navigate away from it
[00:57:00] <Cork> Happzz: so neither domcontentloaded or load is triggered when it's shown again
[00:57:01] <Happzz> well, i need to bind some stuff and such after the page loads, even if it's loaded after a back button
[00:57:45] <unnu> PJAX seems kinda lacking from first glance
[00:57:48] <Cork> ?g mdn page show event
[00:57:49] <b-ot> Cork: Event - Web API reference | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[00:57:54] <Cork> Happzz: ^
[00:57:54] <bot-t> Cork, Event - Web API reference | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
[00:58:24] <Cork> sigh
[00:58:27] <Cork> stupid bots
[00:58:32] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/pageshow
[00:58:51] <Happzz> unnu it's kinda cool actually
[00:59:42] <Happzz> Cork so $(document).pageshow(function() { }) ?
[00:59:51] <Cork> no
[00:59:59] <Cork> $(document).on('pageshow'
[01:00:21] <Happzz> right. lemme try that.
[01:01:01] <yuka> hey need a good suggestion for jquery slider which is responsive and has ken burns effect
[01:01:08] <yuka> price is not problem
[01:01:17] <Happzz> no go
[01:01:19] <bloopletech> grargh you were totally right of course Cork
[01:01:30] <bloopletech> the flot error was preventing anything else from working
[01:02:20] <Cork> Happzz: wait, pajax, are you really doing full page reloads here?
[01:02:28] <Cork> sounds like you aren't
[01:02:55] <Cork> and if you are just doing ajax calls, you need to use the callback for when the ajax call ends
[01:03:14] <Happzz> well it's all cache shit i guess
[01:03:16] <Cork> domcontentloaded and load is only triggered when the full page is reloaded
[01:03:25] <bloopletech> thanks Cork :)
[01:03:26] <Cork> (same for pageshow)
[01:03:30] <Cork> bloopletech: np
[01:03:34] <Happzz> okay, i'll give it some more reading so i dont waste your time
[01:03:35] <Happzz> bbl
[01:04:02] <Happzz> thanks for the info btw.
[01:04:17] <koskoz> hi
[01:04:28] <koskoz> I'd like a way to select the first element having an id
[01:04:37] <koskoz> is it easily possible?
[01:06:28] <Cork> sure $('#id')
[01:06:43] <Cork> id's is by definition unique elements
[01:06:47] <Cork> so you can only have one
[01:07:06] <koskoz> Cork:  but I don't know what the id is ;)
[01:07:14] <Cork> and you can only select the first one if you happen to have more (and if you do you have invalid markup)
[01:07:24] <koskoz> $('#id') is kinda the base knowledge of jquery ;)
[01:07:27] <Cork> O_o
[01:07:38] <Cork> so you want to select an element that has an id attribute...
[01:07:44] <koskoz> I want to select the first div having an id in the matching elements
[01:08:00] <Cork> can you affect the code at all?
[01:08:12] <koskoz> Cork: the markup? Nop, it's generated
[01:08:15] <Cork> like give it a class when it gets the id or something
[01:08:18] <unnu> alright, all i need to do is make these spans turn into <select> text boxes and im done
[01:08:20] <unnu> woot
[01:08:35] <Cork> koskoz: $('elm[id]')
[01:10:12] <koskoz> it works like a charm, thanks Cork
[01:15:33] <maloik_> Does anyone know of a plugin that does something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/maloik/JuCkg/1/ - and regardless of the answer, anyone feel like improving on that with me a little bit? I think it's a great UI pattern but my javascript skills are a bit too limited to pull it off
[01:46:29] <mogaj> how to add a day to a date of format DD-MM-YYYY format?
[01:47:12] <Cork> make a date object out if it and add +1 to the set/getDate
[01:47:41] <unnu> ^^
[01:47:49] <unnu> Cork, your really good at what you do
[01:47:58] <unnu> :)
[01:48:13] <mogaj> Cork: start_date.setDate(start_date.getdate() + 1)  this is giving error
[01:48:39] <mogaj> Cork : error is : no function getdate()
[01:48:46] <Cork> ?eval var a = new Date('2020-01-01'); a
[01:48:51] <bot-t> Cork: <2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z>
[01:49:06] <Cork> ?eval var a = new Date('2020-01-01'); a.setDate(a.getDate() +1); a.toString();
[01:49:07] <bot-t> Cork: "Thu Jan 02 2020 05:30:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)"
[01:49:12] <erinaceus_> Hi, I'm looking for some help, with the development of a jquery-plugin, is this the right place to ask?
[01:49:41] <Cork> ?eval var a = new Date('2020-01-31'); a.setDate(a.getDate() +1); a.toString();
[01:50:05] <Cork> aaand i killed the bot...
[01:50:29] <Cork> erickubenka: just ask, and well see
[01:50:30] <sfdcNoob> die bot die lol
[01:55:13] <erinaceus_> Cork: Damn autocomplete ;) I'm having trouble acessing the arguments variable in a this.each(function () {...}); block. see: http://jsbin.com/etoxil/6/
[01:55:38] <ReBa_> Good morning
[01:55:51] <motaka2> What does server do when it recieves an ajax request which wants to run an action that contains header("header:"$location);  ?
[01:57:52] <Cork> erickubenka: what is this in the rotate function?
[01:58:44] <Cork> motaka2: uh, you mean when the server sets the header?
[01:59:27] <Cork> header("header:"$location); looks like a half broken php line
[01:59:31] <ReBa_> I have this very simple fiddle, but my jquery isn't instantiated? http://jsfiddle.net/eYFg2/ Is there a problem with my jquery file?
[01:59:39] <erinaceus_> Cork: I'll try to make an working example, showing what i mean.
[01:59:44] <mogaj> When used 'start_date.setDate(start_date.getDate() +1);' where start_date = 25-05-2013 i am getting the error as Uncaught TypeError: Object 25-05-2013 has no method 'getDate'
[01:59:53] <Cork> ReBa_: your not including jquery
[02:00:12] <ReBa_> Cork: Via my external resource?
[02:00:18] <ReBa_> Or am I doing that wrong?
[02:00:24] <Cork> erickubenka: you can't use the string, you need to convert it to a date object
[02:01:59] <Cork> ReBa_: jsfiddle isn't including it for some reason
[02:02:28] <motaka2> Cork: I mean when an ajax request is sent to a url on a server running PHP , and the php code at some point contains header ( "Location:" . $url ) ;
[02:02:49] <Cork> ReBa_: the server is responding with the wrong mimetype
[02:03:11] <Cork> oh sorry read wrong
[02:04:23] <Cork> motaka2: header adds the data to the header array in php
[02:04:28] <ReBa_> Cork: Can you tell me where you find that mimetype and is it possible the version is to old? The strange thing is that in my website, there are some js files loaded before mine, and those rely on jquery too and they don't have that problem as it seems :s
[02:04:44] <Cork> motaka2: and php outputs the array the first thing it does when it gives the string back to the web server
[02:05:11] <Cork> ReBa_: like i said, i read wrong, there is nothing wrong with the mimetype
[02:05:46] <Cork> and i really don't know why jsfiddle doesn't add the resource to the page
[02:05:46] <ReBa_> Cork: Ow sorry, thought it was a reaction on motaka :)
[02:06:18] <Cork> as far as i can tell it should work just fine :/
[02:06:44] <ReBa_> It's a strange error isn't it :P
[02:07:46] <Cork> ReBa_: this seams to work though http://jsfiddle.net/eYFg2/1/
[02:07:58] <Cork> looks like jsfiddle is picky about the string ending with .js
[02:09:52] <ReBa_> Will try to leave the ?v1.4.4 behind so the code gets interpretted
[02:10:03] <motaka2> Cork: I dont understand you, but anyway in not ajax mode when I call those urls , they redirect me to the url, is that not possible to do the same when I call them in ajax mode?
[02:10:44] <not_mike> cork, what do you do for a living
[02:12:23] <motaka2> not_mike: Js programming ?
[02:12:45] <motaka2> not_mike: I live that sort of questions
[02:13:21] <motaka2> love*
[02:13:59] <ReBa_> Cork: I found my problem. Because I'm using drupal, I encoutered following problem/sollution > http://orkjern.com/jquery-not-working-drupal-7-not-function
[02:14:43] <ReBa_> But in the jsfiddle, it isn't loaded anyway...

[02:53:09] <Krambiorix> Cork, the parent frame
[02:53:13] <Krambiorix> or parent of parent
[02:53:29] <Cork> hXm: uh, registrate works for me
[02:53:40] <hXm> is the right button beside registrate
[02:53:41] <Cork> Krambiorix: window.parent?
[02:53:45] <hXm> should appear a dropdown menu
[02:53:51] <ThoMe> hiho

[02:54:20] <ThoMe> $(".appLogo").tooltip({ ....
[02:54:37] <ThoMe> must i run again $(".appLogo").tooltip({ after load the conext (ajax)?
[02:55:06] <Cork> hXm: z-index: 2;
[02:55:08] <dopie> hummm...
[02:55:17] <dopie> fabioportieri, are you brasilian by any chance
[02:55:20] <ThoMe> ideas?
[02:55:27] <ThoMe> or is it posible with live() ?
[02:55:34] <Cork> live is dead
[02:55:37] <Cork> don't use it
[02:55:50] <dopie> fabioportieri, and for some reason it doesnt work
[02:55:50] <fabioportieri> dopie: nop
[02:55:51] <dopie> :(
[02:55:56] <dopie> when i add your line
[02:56:03] <hXm> so easy!, right it works, thanks
[02:56:14] <ThoMe> Cork: hm. live is dead. and now?
[02:56:19] <fabioportieri> dopie: make sure you have an element with the class you're targeting
[02:56:21] <Cork> ?.delegate
[02:56:27] <mogaj> How to change dd-mm-yyyy to yyyy-mm-dd ?
[02:56:29] <Cork> `api delegate
[02:56:29] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[02:56:54] <Cork> ThoMe: read up on what has been the standard way of doing it since ff1.5
[02:57:25] <dopie> fabioportieri,  it works fine... like on the page it is on it works perfect... my problem is lets say i goto article 1 and then return
[02:57:33] <dopie> to index
[02:57:34] <dopie> page
[02:57:47] <dopie> it breaks
[02:57:51] <dopie> and doesnt work

[02:58:07] <Cork> js> print('dd-mm-yyyy'.split('-').reverse().join('-'))

[02:59:16] <Cork> js> var a = new Date('12-08-2007'.split('-').reverse().join('-')); a.setDate(a.getDate() + 1); print(a.toString());
[02:59:18] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[02:59:20] <ThoMe> Cork: how i can use this with $(".appLogo").tooltip({ ?
[02:59:35] <ThoMe> $(".appLogo").on(tooltip({ ?
[02:59:41] <Cork> ThoMe: you can't
[02:59:53] <ThoMe> Cork: hm. ok.
[02:59:55] <Cork> tooltip needs to process each element
[03:00:08] <Cork> so it can't do it based on a parent
[03:00:36] <Cork> ThoMe: though a plugin could be written in a way so it would work in a delegated kind of way
[03:01:01] <Cork> ThoMe: btw, on has both a bind and a delegate syntax, its the delegate syntax that is a replacement for live
[03:01:32] <Cork> js> var a = new Date('12-08-2007'.split('-').reverse().join('-')); print(a.toString());
[03:01:32] <mogaj> Cork : Can look at this http://jsfiddle.net/7Q4Ae/3/
[03:01:35] <b-ot> Cork: Invalid Date
[03:01:37] <Cork> hmm
[03:02:21] <Cork> uh.... no that won't work
[03:02:33] <Cork> if you create a new date you will get a new date not the old one
[03:03:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7Q4Ae/5/
[03:03:22] <mogaj> Cork : are you saying about my code?^
[03:03:40] <Cork> opps that didn't create a copy
[03:03:42] <Cork> mogaj: yes
[03:04:00] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/7Q4Ae/6/
[03:05:46] <mogaj> Cork : Problem is this date '2013-05-21' is in this format '21-05-2013' ... i need convert it into 2013-05-21 to get next date
[03:06:16] <Cork> mogaj: http://jsfiddle.net/7Q4Ae/7/
[03:06:16] <fabioportieri> mogaj you were provided with a function that does the conversion, cork wrote another one, why don't you put the pieces togheter?
[03:06:45] <mogaj> Thank you
[03:08:22] <ThoMe> Cork: why works this: $('table').on('click', 'img', function() {
[03:08:32] <ThoMe> but not: $('.requestNew').on('click', 'img', function() {
[03:08:33] <ThoMe> ?
[03:08:33] <ThoMe> :-)
[03:08:43] <Cork> does .requestNew exist in the page?
[03:08:50] <Cork> (when this line runs)
[03:08:58] <ThoMe> Cork: hm. no :-)
[03:09:01] <Cork> there you go
[03:09:17] <Cork> $() can't select something that doesn't exist
[03:09:20] <ThoMe> mh.
[03:09:23] <ThoMe> ok
[03:15:20] <Krambiorix> i have an iframe in an iframe and in that inner iframe there is a modal dialog. Well... In that dialog i want to get a hidden input field's value that exists in the top frame... How can i do that,
[03:15:42] <Cork> Krambiorix: window.parent.parent
[03:15:55] <Cork> but only if they are all from the same domain
[03:18:42] <unnu> whats the correct way to use data from a function parameter as a jquery selector?
[03:18:46] <unnu> editPost = function(number){ $('div#number')
[03:18:59] <unnu> ^^ not like that i assume
[03:19:04] <Cork> $('#' + number)
[03:19:11] <unnu> gotcha
[03:19:16] <unnu> tanks
[03:19:26] <Cork> and again no element infront of id's
[03:19:34] <BrixSat> Hello
[03:19:40] <unnu> lol, sorry?
[03:19:52] <Cork> div#id
[03:20:01] <Cork> it's pointless
[03:20:04] <Cork> just do #id
[03:20:23] <BrixSat> i need some help, im trying to load pages (html) in to jquery mobile, but i dont want to replace whole page just load the page to a specific div and show the page loaded there, what is the best way?
[03:20:54] <Cork> BrixSat: if it's a full page; iframe not a div
[03:21:15] <Cork> else you would have to load a fragment, and then its just the body part of the page
[03:21:19] <BrixSat> Cork:  its only the div with the content
[03:21:22] <Cork> (at most)
[03:21:30] <unnu> sorry cork, ill keep it in mind
[03:21:51] <Cork> BrixSat: $('div').load('url-to-fragment-file.html')
[03:22:08] <BrixSat> in jquery mobile is that the right way?
[03:22:34] <Cork> unnu: no need to say sorry, it's just tips and knowledge
[03:22:43] <unnu> lol
[03:22:43] <unnu> thanks
[03:22:48] <Krambiorix> Cork, all in the same domain but i get window.parent.parent.getElementById is not a function
[03:22:48] <hawtin> I need a little bit of help here http://jsfiddle.net/melbourne/mcTBM/
[03:23:03] <Cork> BrixSat: i know mobile has some special load second full page stuff, and ya i think thats how you do it
[03:23:23] <Cork> Krambiorix: window doesn't have getElementById
[03:23:32] <BrixSat> Cork: i dont think that would be the best way, but if nothing else works :/ i was doing this way http://paste.ubuntu.com/5712941/
[03:24:11] <hawtin> the function its not triggered upon first click on the table row(#trig) and if you expand/close multiple times the function duplicate the percentage numbers over and over again
[03:24:16] <Cork> Krambiorix: window.parent.parent.document.getElementById
[03:25:22] <Cork> O_o
[03:25:50] <Cork> you start an infinite loop for each existing element with a class skillbar everytime #trig is clicked
[03:26:00] <Cork> why on earth would you do that??
[03:26:16] <hawtin> because Im a n00b
[03:26:17] <Krambiorix> Cork, window.parent.parent.document.getElementById("customercode") -> undefined ...
[03:27:25] <Cork> Krambiorix: what does window.parent.parent.document give you?
[03:27:56] <Krambiorix> Cork, [object HTMLDocument]
[03:28:24] <Cork> so there isn't an element with id="customercode" in that document
[03:29:14] <Krambiorix> Cork, window.parent.parent.parent.document.innerHTML --> undefined
[03:30:05] <mogaj> Finally wrote this function to get whatever date you want depending on the given date and given days http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/UjGpp/3/
[03:30:05] <Trudko> Guys I would like to find header which has value A in these tables: http://jsbin.com/odaruh/1/edit
[03:30:22] <Cork> Krambiorix: hard to tell what happens there
[03:30:41] <hawtin> Cork is there a way to fix it, I understand what are you saying and I was thinking that myself, but I am lost in js .. :/
[03:31:08] <unnu> alright, i dont want someone to code this out for me, but i do want to know a good place to go to learn how http://jsfiddle.net/UqkCw/4/ to turn text into a select text input
[03:31:09] <hawtin> I see .each(functon but Idk what to replace it with or what to do..  crazy
[03:31:13] <Cork> eh...
[03:31:26] <Cork> mogaj: ever heard of toFixed?
[03:31:39] <Cork> ?g mdn toFixed
[03:31:40] <b-ot> Cork: toFixed - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[03:31:42] <bot-t> Cork, toFixed - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed
[03:32:01] <unnu> google is returning good ways to do the opposite but not text to textboxes
[03:32:29] <hawtin> :\
[03:32:40] <mogaj> Cork : no ... am reading about it now
[03:33:29] <Rinthe> anyone know alot about masonry?
[03:34:32] <Cork> mogaj: ah, sorry forgot that toFixed is for decimals not numbers
[03:34:59] <Krambiorix> Cork, got it: window.parent.parent.parent.document.getElementById("customercode").value
[03:35:55] <Cork> unnu: span.replaceWith($('<input type="text">').val(span.text()))
[03:36:04] <Cork> where span is the span you want to make editable
[03:36:15] <Cork> Krambiorix: ah, so another parent
[03:36:26] <unnu> kay, can i trim stuff off of.val?
[03:36:39] <Cork> sure
[03:36:43] <Krambiorix> Cork, thanks for your help
[03:36:47] <Cork> np
[03:37:03] <unnu> like right now it says price: $12.22, what if i wanna turn that into 12.22 . . . does jquery have regex?
[03:37:04] <unnu> nvm
[03:37:06] <unnu> google ho
[03:37:37] <Cork> unnu: no, jquery doens't have much string modification functions at all
[03:37:41] <Cork> but plain js does
[03:37:46] <Cork> and that's what you need here
[03:37:53] <unnu> kay
[03:38:04] <Cork> ?g mdn replace
[03:38:05] <b-ot> Cork: replace - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[03:38:06] <bot-t> Cork, replace - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[03:38:07] <unnu> lol, i didn't know any javascript a week ago
[03:38:24] <unnu> im a php guy, but i like the idea of ajax
[03:38:37] <Cork> replace(/^\$/, '') should work
[03:38:47] <unnu> yeah
[03:39:14] <unnu> i was doing it with explode()
[03:39:25] <unnu> and you had to load the page over and over and over
[03:39:38] <unnu> i just wanna update the content because it looks cleaner
[03:39:47] <Piotr84> Hi guys
[03:40:07] <Cork> unnu: if you want to be really creative you can edit the content inline :)
[03:40:11] <Piotr84> I googled about jquery ui autocomplete /autofocus and it works. But my question is how to set focus by default on first item when input field is empty?
[03:40:45] <unnu> Cork, like css the input box? when you change the content it ajax's the text?
[03:41:16] <Cork> unnu: http://jsfiddle.net/2mxec/
[03:41:35] <Cork> just click the number and edit it :)
[03:42:23] <unnu> what sorcery is that?
[03:42:28] <Cork> lol
[03:42:31] <unnu> burn the witch
[03:42:32] <unnu> lol
[03:42:33] <Cork> REALLY old one
[03:42:42] <unnu> thats neat
[03:42:48] <Cork> contentEditable was invented back in the 90's
[03:42:53] <unnu> lol
[03:43:06] <Cork> but wasn't added to a spec until something like last year
[03:43:34] <Cork> through the whatwg group
[03:43:41] <unnu> yeah, this site is for old people that want their own facebook for farmers basically
[03:43:47] <unnu> so i wanna make it simple
[03:43:49] <unnu> and obvious
[03:43:55] <unnu> lol
[03:44:12] <Piotr84> Is here someone that know jquery-ui/autocomplete ?
[03:44:15] <Cork> ya, discoverability is one of the upsides of the old solution
[03:44:32] <Cork> on the other hand you can style the element when it is editable and make it more obvious
[03:44:42] <Cork> Piotr84: ask the question instead of asking for ppl
[03:44:52] <unnu> it worked great, still does, in php that is
[03:44:57] <Piotr84> I asked :)
[03:45:01] <unnu> ive coded php for ever
[03:45:11] <Piotr84> (12:40:11) Piotr84: I googled about jquery ui autocomplete /autofocus and it works. But my question is how to set focus by default on first item when input field is empty?
[03:45:31] <unnu> whats your question Pitr84? your doing what i did when i first came here. dont ask for a person, ask a question and everyone can try to help
[03:45:41] <Cork> Piotr84: you prob need to do that you're self
[03:46:36] <Cork> you mean to auto fill the field when the autocomplete starts with the first result in the list?
[03:47:20] <Piotr84> yep with the first element of the list
[03:47:29] <unnu> $(input :not([value])).focus()  ??
[03:47:53] <unnu> im asking btw
[03:47:56] <Cork> Piotr84: if the value an array in the page or a remote thing?
[03:48:07] <Cork> unnu: no that won't work
[03:48:09] <Piotr84> remove
[03:48:13] <Piotr84> remote*
[03:48:19] <unnu> kay
[03:48:29] <Cork> then you would have to make a call to that resource your self
[03:48:53] <Piotr84> there's no problem if first sign is typed in - then autoFocus: true works
[03:49:11] <Cork> $.get(url).done(function(data) { $('input.autocomplete').val(data[0].name); });
[03:49:15] <Piotr84> but I need it to focus on first item event if input is empty
[03:49:47] <Cork> ah, you mean not fill the input but to make the first element highlighted
[03:49:48] <Cork> hmm
[03:49:51] <esas> anyone know of an issue with ajax in jquery and android browsers? or json2.js?
[03:50:01] <Cork> not sure if there is a way to do that; ever needed it
[03:50:03] <Piotr84> yes - highlighed
[03:50:16] <esas> didn't have time to debug and haven't got access to a device until next week argh
[03:50:36] <Cork> esas: no, never had any problem with ajax on android
[03:51:12] <Cork> Piotr84: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/autocomplete-automatically-select-first-item-in-dropdown-or-add-item-into-drop-down-menu
[03:51:17] <esas> thanks.. must be something with the json parsing.. I suppose I can use jquery to parse the json since im only parsing and not strigifying
[03:51:56] <Cork> esas: and android do have JSON, so no need for a lib
[03:52:18] <Cork> at least from 2.3+
[03:52:27] <Cork> (haven't bothered to check the older ones)
[03:52:39] <esas> sweet, thanks, I'll look into it :)
[03:52:46] <Piotr84> hmmm saw this one but I'm looking for a solution without adding additional plugins
[03:53:06] <Cork> Piotr84: so grab the code the plugin uses and do that
[03:53:24] <Cork> plugins is just a way to make it easy to snap in
[03:54:23] <Piotr84> ok :)
[03:54:26] <Piotr84> thanks
[03:56:56] <Rinthe> can someone take a look at a masonry problem i have?
[04:09:27] <unnu> Cork, i am getting frustrated with this
[04:09:59] <bittyx-work> hiya! i'm using jquery 1.9.1 without the migrate plugin, as i'm trying to do more "modern" programming, but i've come into a situation where i need browser detection ( $.browser.msie ), rather than feature detection, since i'm dealing with an IE-specific bug. the problem is that radio inputs in IE don't trigger "change" events, only "click". so i want to subscribe to "change" events in normal browser
[04:09:59] <bittyx-work> s, but "click" in IE. any ideas how to do that without explicit browser detection? thanks!
[04:10:02] <unnu> lol, i thought it would be simpler to replace stuff with inputs
[04:11:12] <Cork> bittyx-work: no, those would fall in the small list of browser sniffing
[04:11:47] <bittyx-work> Cork: that sucks. thanks for the advice, though!
[04:11:49] <Cork> basically you can't test for it without user action, and that makes it hard to do
[04:12:04] <Cork> bittyx-work: though you could bind both and have code handle the difference
[04:12:23] <Cork> bittyx-work: btw, why do you need change at all?
[04:12:34] <Cork> just bind click, all browsers should trigger it just fine
[04:12:59] <Cork> (and it is the preferred way to do it)
[04:13:26] <bittyx-work> Cork: well, i'm working on a somewhat old codebase, and the event is already bound to "change" (though unfortunately, it isn't documented why exactly), but i need to fix it to work in IE.
[04:13:33] <bittyx-work> Cork: the thing is, it's not just radio buttons
[04:14:00] <bittyx-work> Cork: the UI has <li> container elements (including images) with hidden radio buttons, and clicking on the <li> propagates the click down to the radio element itself
[04:14:06] <Cork> bittyx-work: you need to change the code to selectively use click for radio buttons and checkboxes
[04:14:15] <Cork> bittyx-work: change is the wrong event for those
[04:14:41] <Cork> ah, so they prob picked change to work around bubbling events
[04:14:46] <Cork> instead of just handling them
[04:15:35] <bittyx-work> Cork: ah, so i should just bind a function to stop the propagation when the radio button is clicked?
[04:15:59] <bittyx-work> Cork: but wait, the radio inputs are hidden - will their "click" events propagate to their parents at all?
[04:16:03] <Cork> bittyx-work: or just do if(event.target !== this) { return; }
[04:16:21] <Cork> bittyx-work: yes, hidden doesn't matter for event propagation
[04:16:49] <bittyx-work> Cork: hmm, they were probably *not* hidden in some older iteration of the project, so that's why they had to do it this way. old code sucks.
[04:17:16] <Cork> not had to choosed to
[04:17:34] <Cork> they choosed to pick a different event instead of handling the bubbling events
[04:18:22] <bittyx-work> Cork: so they made a mistake from the start, i get it. thanks for all the tips, i'll work towards solving this problem "correctly".
[04:20:39] <bittyx-work> Cork: ah, i just found out what they did. the container click handler does: if $(e.target).is("input") { return; }
[04:20:48] <maloik_> Does anyone know of a plugin that does something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/maloik/JuCkg/1/ - and regardless of the answer, anyone feel like improving on that with me a little bit? I think it's a great UI pattern but my javascript skills are a bit too limited to pull it off
[04:20:59] <bittyx-work> Cork: the input click handler does e.stopPropagation(); immediately
[04:21:38] <bittyx-work> Cork: and the change handler is bound like this: $("#form").on("change", "input:radio", inputChangeHandler);
[04:21:51] <bittyx-work> Cork: so they used "change" because the "click" never propagates to the "#form" element
[04:22:28] <bittyx-work> Cork: they did this because the container elements (with their radio buttons) are added dynamically to the form (based on some AJAX requests)
[04:22:52] <bittyx-work> Cork: so instead of manually "rebinding" events to the radio inputs themselves each time a new element is added, they listen to the events on the form
[04:24:17] <Cork> so the problem is the stopPropagation
[05:00:39] <lolmaus> I'm doing `$('.foo').each`. I struggle to figure out how to check whether `this` is the **last of visible elements**. Can you please help?
[05:04:14] <Rinthe> can someone help me with masonry?

[05:13:08] <Cork> lemonsparrow: ##javascript
[05:14:05] <lolmaus> lemonsparrow, you're not using jQuery. If you were, it would be as simple as `.attr("selected", "selected")`.
[05:14:20] <Cork> uh no
[05:14:36] <Cork> its val() on the select
[05:18:02] <lemonsparrow> lolmaus: how to rewrite it in jquery ?
[05:20:16] <lemonsparrow> Cork: meaning ?
[05:20:19] <Cork> var select = $('#Server').append($.map(Names, function(name) { return $('<option>').attr('value', getKey(ServerList, name).text(name); }));
[05:20:23] <Cork> bah sorry
[05:20:38] <Cork> $('#Server').append($.map(Names, function(name) { return $('<option>').attr('value', getKey(ServerList, name).text(name)[0]; }));
[05:20:39] <Cork> there
[05:21:12] <Cork> and $('#Server').val(foo); would select it
[05:21:20] <Cork> so $('#Server').append($.map(Names, function(name) { return $('<option>').attr('value', getKey(ServerList, name).text(name)[0]; })).val(foo);
[05:22:18] <lemonsparrow> Cork: thanks

[05:57:06] <AcTiVaTeWoRk> Hi all, I am struggling with a script that sends an email and uses POST. The .ajax is triggered but for some reason I only get the success function to work when accessing the script directly instead of using the link on the website.
[06:01:32] <Tumulte> quick question : is $(funtion(){ still available with jquery 2 ?
[06:08:58] <AcTiVaTeWoRk> When I enter the commands from the function in Firebug console I do get the expected result. Can it be related to the jQuery version?
[06:09:09] <AcTiVaTeWoRk> The site still uses 1.4.4
[06:13:54] <rosieres> how do I manipulate array data on the fly ? e.g. I grab var foo = img.position(); -> var bar = foo.[left+5],[top+5]; Do you know what I mean ?
[06:17:17] <Happzz> ok me again
[06:17:50] <Happzz> $(document).on('pageshow', function() { alert(1); });
[06:17:54] <Happzz> this doesn't work. any ideas why?
[06:18:15] <amaroks> Happzz: what is pagesshow
[06:18:47] <Happzz> a workaround for binding stuff after a page is loaded with the back button
[06:19:54] <amaroks> Happzz: do you have it in the first page?
[06:20:01] <Happzz> what do you mean
[06:20:47] <amaroks> Happzz: look at this http://forum.jquery.com/topic/pageshow-event-not-working
[06:20:55] <Happzz> maybe i'm doing something entirely wrong. i have $('#x').tablesorter({ ... });
[06:21:07] <Happzz> that bind or whatever it's called, won't work after the page is loaded via the back button
[06:23:42] <rosieres> anyone for my array question ?
[06:24:33] <rosieres> or do I have to build a new array ?
[06:25:31] <amaroks> rosieres: not sure what you mean, is it an array, object or simply attribute that you want to modify?
[06:27:14] <rosieres> I am really asking for position() and want to manipulate it directly there ....
[06:27:40] <rosieres> and position is an array afaik
[06:27:55] <amaroks> rosieres: something like element.style.left
[06:29:25] <rosieres> amaroks var foo = img.position(); makes an array of left: and top: and I want to calculate something in addition to it.
[06:29:58] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. IdeaS?
[06:30:00] <Happzz> anyone?

[06:40:44] <Misan> I was using lists earlier, but after reading this article, I really found that it makes no difference, except you are using a framework that is limiting you to use a certain markup
[06:41:05] <jedimind> Misan in that type of code structure, you would be better off using <nav> element
[06:41:10] <jedimind> rather than <div class="navigation">
[06:41:16] <Misan> I do use <nav>
[06:43:00] <rosieres> i´d write my own one. and do the matching by class or something like that
[06:47:22] <erickubenka> Is there a way to catch the php5.4 upload progress status with the laravel Session-class?
[06:48:00] <erickubenka> ehhh . wrong chan
[06:53:08] <jeffsmykil> Does QUnit clear the fixture after every asyncTest?
[06:53:13] <jeffsmykil> It doesn't appear to be
[06:53:26] <jimi_> I want to apply a function to all elements with class "foo" except the first one, how can I do this?
[07:06:44] <rosieres> jimi_ : http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[07:07:43] <rosieres> jimi_ and there´s also a CSS selector for that afaik
[07:10:15] <stephanedemotte> !
[07:11:28] <stephanedemotte> :D
[07:18:17] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Yes it does. QUnit clears the fixture after every QUnit.test. QUnit.asyncTest is just a wrapper around QUnit.test
[07:19:05] <jeffsmykil> hrm
[07:19:10] <jeffsmykil> interesting
[07:19:20] <jeffsmykil> wonder why these popups aren't going away then
[07:19:28] <jeffsmykil> oh maybe because they were made visible
[07:19:36] <jeffsmykil> but never switched back to not visible
[07:20:38] <jeffsmykil> are the css state cleared out crinkle?
[07:20:41] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle:
[07:21:01] <drager> So I have made a preview function for my site; http://jsfiddle.net/zF2zz/ it works as expected but when the second "tab" is active I want to change the text "Write comment" to "Continue writing" or something like that. Any ideas?
[07:21:02] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: The entire fixture is destroyed and re-created by parsing the original html
[07:24:04] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle I take it from my reading there is no way to run the tests headless for IE 7-9
[07:25:18] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: reading where? And if by headless you mean in the cloud and automated, then actually yes that's perfectly possible.
[07:25:30] <jeffsmykil> also do I have to call stop on an ajax test to purge this dom?
[07:25:43] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: I mean without opening a browser window
[07:26:18] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: You can test without opening a browser window on your computer, it'll have to be opened somewhere else naturally.
[07:27:20] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: A common practice is to test in the cloud, e.g. a service that provides instant access to a cluster of VMs with various OS/browser combinations waiting to open a url. Accessible through a simple JSON api.
[07:27:27] <Krinkle> Such as SauceLabs or BrowserStack.
[07:27:46] <jeffsmykil> yeah Krinkle I know there is a headless webkit solution
[07:27:51] <jeffsmykil> phantom or rhino maybe
[07:28:50] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I wasn;t referring to headless webkit solutios
[07:29:04] <Krinkle> phantomjs/rhino are for running a headless browser *locally*
[07:29:29] <Krinkle> To my knowledge webkit is the only engine that has been ported to a reliable headless platform.
[07:29:58] <Krinkle> But as Im trying to tell you, there is no need to run them locally. And for the record, I think headless platforms are starting to become less reliable because they're less realistic.
[07:30:23] <Krinkle> I'd highly recommend you don't rely on it. It can be used as a quick test in e.g. grunt (together with lint) to do before testing in real browsers.
[07:30:38] <Krinkle> That way you fail early if it doesn't even work in phantomjs
[07:30:55] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Look into using saucelabs (e.g. grunt-saucelabs) and things like that
[07:31:26] <Krinkle> IE does not have a headless browser, and if anyone claims they do I'd highly doubt it will be useful (likely to have bugs or to be better than the original)
[07:32:25] <jonez> greetings. I'm using a framework I wrote some years ago, and I need to use a couple of jqueryui widgets. I have no idea how to configure it such that it will find css and png files in specific folders.
[07:32:49] <jonez> do I need to make a 'custom' build?
[07:33:05] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: this is all very overwhelming, I'm getting very little direction from the 'architect'
[07:34:28] <c4ptnh00k> Morning gents
[07:34:39] <BillCriswell> mornin' laddie
[07:35:10] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I'm not sure what else I can do from here. There's a lot of information, I'd recommend digesting it slowly if this is new to you. There's a lot of information out there on the web too, that's where most people get it from (at their own speed and curve) and they manage well.
[07:35:18] <BillCriswell> Trying to get my stackoverflow score up but these peope are too damn fast haha.
[07:35:44] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: I was just venting, wasn't expecting you to do anything
[07:36:33] <jeffsmykil> I apologize if it came across that way
[07:36:59] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: Not at all. I was just covering my bases and throwing various keywords out there for you to further look into as you see fit.
[07:37:09] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: I have a very low score since people dont accept my answer because I dont write the code for them. I just refuse to do someone elses homework lol didnt even do Mine back in the day
[07:38:01] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle there is just a ton of refactoring to do to make the code more testable
[07:38:04] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Dont mind showing example and filling in some blanks, but damn they want you to do it for  them lol
[07:38:12] <BillCriswell> I get stuck trying to make my examples too clear I think.
[07:38:28] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Yeah. I dislike that as well. I can usually tell between not trying and just not getting it, though.
[07:38:45] <BillCriswell> It's probably about half and half.
[07:38:49] <c4ptnh00k> I guess I need to get better at doing that
[07:39:29] <dcherman> jeffsmykil: im probably jumping in this late, but testswarm is a great option too if you can't or don't want to allow 3rd parties like saucelabs access to it ( i'm sure Krinkle probably mentioned that before i got here tho ).  it's pretty easy to set up.
[07:40:18] <jeffsmykil> Krinkle: one more piece of advice if you don't mind.  Should i be unit testing using the actual code by loading it in a iframe or should I just insert as little code into the fixture as possible to test each case?
[07:41:00] <c4ptnh00k> mmm monster energy drink to the rescue
[07:41:01] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: by code you mean html? or javascript?
[07:41:19] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I don't think iframes should be used in any way in this context.
[07:41:38] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: I'd keep the fixture mostly empty and insert into it what you need from within QUnit.test
[07:41:39] <c4ptnh00k> iframe bad man
[07:42:11] <Krinkle> jeffsmykil: if you need the same type of fixture for all tests in a group ('QUnit.module') you can set the fixture from QUnit.module( 'name of group', { setup: function() { ... set fixture ... } });
[07:42:51] <Krinkle> that way you don't have to repeat it 20x in the code, yet still don't have to inject it in the raw qunit-fixture which is shared with all tests in all groups (as opposed to just all tests in 1 group)
[07:44:19] <jeffsmykil> do you usually set up directory structure to mimic the javascript director structure?
[07:49:15] <motaka2> hello, using this code I try to alert that he has new messages, but it seems he always has new messages!! Would you please tell me what's wrong ?
[07:49:16] <stephen_camilo> folks, is there any reference page for jQuery-Ui effects and it's options?
[07:49:32] <jedimind> yeah, the jquery-ui site ?
[07:49:45] <motaka2> hello, using this code I try to alert that he has new messages, but it seems he always has new messages!! Would you please tell me what's wrong ? http://codepaste.net/psmcm9
[07:50:43] <stephen_camilo> jedimind: there is a list of efects, but I could not find their options
[07:51:27] <JimmyXander> I have a jquery question
[07:51:53] <SmokeyD> hey everyone. I am executing some jquery in a page that is not mine (using firebug) to automate some stuff. The jquery causes an async post request to be fired. Can I check somehow (without being able to modify the javascript that actually fires the POST) to detect that the POST request has completed.
[07:52:28] <JimmyXander> I am building a form that will generate a block of code based on the information I enter into the fields. How to I gather the values of each individual fields into separate variables?
[07:53:27] <jonez> JimmyXander, $foo = $("div").val() should work
[07:53:30] <dcherman> SmokeyD: yes - you can use an ajaxPrefilter to attach an additional handler to the jqXHR.  see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxPrefilter/
[07:53:42] <JimmyXander> I'm getting undefined
[07:53:58] <jonez> are you using the right selector?
[07:54:14] <JimmyXander> $("input[name='imgtype']")
[07:54:27] <SmokeyD> dcherman: cool. THanks a lot. I am checking it out
[07:54:29] <motaka2> hello, using this code I try to alert that he has new messages, but it seems he always has new messages!! Would you please tell me what's wrong ? http://codepaste.net/psmcm9
[07:56:50] <JimmyXander> @jonez: I should mention that the first value I'm trying to get is from radio buttons.
[07:57:58] <RohanBhangui> JimmyXander: http://www.somacon.com/p143.php
[07:58:00] <jonez> JimmyXander, first make sure that the selector gives you the right object. maybe with radio buttons val() is not defined
[07:58:21] <manuelbieh> guys
[07:58:27] <RohanBhangui> its javascript i know but should be easy to "convert" to java
[07:58:28] <manuelbieh> i'm receiving html via ajax
[07:58:37] <manuelbieh> a complete html document including doctype etc
[07:58:58] <manuelbieh> and i need to select the #content section
[07:59:14] <RohanBhangui> manuelbieh: $(data).find("#content);
[07:59:15] <JimmyXander> how do I indicate a return(line break) inside my console.log?
[07:59:18] <manuelbieh> so i tried: $(content).find('#content')
[07:59:24] <manuelbieh> but i always get an error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: <!DOCTYPE html>
[07:59:41] <manuelbieh> content is the html string i receive in my success callback
[08:00:00] <RohanBhangui> manualbieh: when there is success in ajax request do $(data).find("#content")
[08:00:14] <RohanBhangui> manuelbieh: when there is success in ajax request do $(data).find("#content")
[08:00:14] <jonez> I have not been able to find instructions on how to install jqueryui themes. the css files I have have relative paths in url()s and it does not match how my site is set up. is there a way to change that?
[08:01:03] <manuelbieh> RohanBhangui that's what i did but jquery seems to have some problems with the response
[08:01:38] <RohanBhangui> did you console.log the result?
[08:02:21] <manuelbieh> jep. its the html document i'm expecting as string
[08:03:04] <RohanBhangui> well you have to do $(data).find("#content").html()
[08:03:17] <RohanBhangui> console.log that and see what it returns
[08:03:37] <manuelbieh> unrecognized expression
[08:03:40] <manuelbieh> i already tried that
[08:03:43] <RohanBhangui> hmmmmmm
[08:03:46] <manuelbieh> console.log(typeof content) is string
[08:04:06] <manuelbieh> it's the complete html document i'm requesting including doctype, head, etc ...
[08:04:16] <manuelbieh> so $(content) should actually work fine
[08:04:22] <manuelbieh> but it does not and i dont know why
[08:04:37] <RohanBhangui> $(content) ?
[08:04:46] <RohanBhangui> hmmm
[08:04:58] <manuelbieh> yes. content is the variable name ;)
[08:05:29] <RohanBhangui> function on success is set up as: .success function (content)
[08:06:07] <JimmyXander> okay so \n indicates a line break, how do I indicate a tab?
[08:06:31] <jedimind> JimmyXander \t
[08:06:34] <jedimind> shocking
[08:06:37] <jgomes> jonez: maybe find and replace on image urls on the css or mod_rewrite
[08:06:41] <JimmyXander> thank you
[08:06:42] <RohanBhangui> maneulbieh: i have no idea i suggest you play around a bit
[08:06:55] <jonez> jgomes, ew ;)
[08:07:08] <jonez> what does the "css scope" field in the themeroller do?
[08:07:52] <manuelbieh> http://nopaste.info/3921e4be83.html
[08:09:35] <c4ptnh00k> I have a jqgrid and I would like to add an autocomplete method that I have to one of my search parameters. Where should I make My json request? Here is my Jqgrid mockup http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/RsnC4/
[08:09:49] <jgomes> jonez: by default the css is applyed to your entire page
[08:10:13] <jonez> jgomes, the issue is that the image urls are not correct
[08:10:24] <jonez> I just noticed a 'jquery-ui-themes' zipball, imma try that
[08:11:16] <jgomes> jonez: using the css scope you can apply the css to elements inside a specific page, that's what css scope does
[08:11:26] <jonez> oh. :)
[08:11:29] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I'm trying to create an accordion effect by using toggle. I got it, but I'd like to apply an "open" class to the expanded element, but I'm no longer able to remove the "open" class when clicking on a new element. http://pastebin.com/b7mWqG5w
[08:12:21] <motaka2> hello, using this code I try to alert that he has new messages, but it seems he always has new messages!! Would you please tell me what's wrong ? http://codepaste.net/psmcm9
[08:12:28] <motaka2> no one sees my question ?
[08:13:07] <jgomes> jonez: I understand your problem... but image folder of the images in the css are not configurable
[08:13:09] <jedimind> maybe he's just really popular ?
[08:13:27] <jonez> jgomes, I consider that a serious bug
[08:14:08] <jgomes> jonez: not a bug, but a missed feature
[08:14:10] <jedimind> which plugin are you guys talking about ?
[08:14:12] <DeltaHeavy> motaka2: Firstly, you're using a depreciated usage of $.ajax()
[08:14:46] <jonez> jgomes, same thing ;)
[08:14:59] <c4ptnh00k> motaka2: well your condition must have been hit. put in a break point and check your values
[08:15:25] <jgomes> jonez: lolol
[08:15:42] <c4ptnh00k> I have a jqgrid and I would like to add an autocomplete method that I have to one of my search parameters. Where should I make My json request? Here is my Jqgrid mockup http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/RsnC4/
[08:18:00] <c4ptnh00k>  found this but a little unclear http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6037104/jqgrid-toolbar-search-with-autocomplete-using-json-data
[08:19:24] <abes> ^^jfc^^: any chance you can put that on jsfiddle with the actual HTML that you are controlling? thanks
[08:19:39] <JimmyXander> how do you get the content inside of a text area?
[08:19:55] <JimmyXander> let me reword that
[08:19:56] <e-anima> i want to load json data from a php script to my js file...so i used $.ajax({ ... and it is working well. BUT. i want to save the data to a variable fo usage and not using success:function (data) { ...
[08:19:59] <e-anima> is that even possible
[08:20:00] <^^jfc^^> of course abes, just a minute :)
[08:20:12] <JimmyXander> how do I put create a value that is set to the content of a textarea
[08:21:32] <c4ptnh00k> ... :( oh i see how it is. No love in the room
[08:21:34] <c4ptnh00k> lol
[08:22:39] <abes> JimmyXander: like this? var text = $('textarea#mytextarea').val();
[08:22:59] <JimmyXander> val is giving me undefined…must be something screwed up in my code
[08:23:00] <JimmyXander> thanks
[08:23:14] <jonez> JimmyXander, try value()
[08:27:22] <c4ptnh00k> try MonkeyBall() that will def work
[08:27:51] <dutchguy> Hi everyone. Could someone tell me what the error in the following piece of jquery is? http://jsfiddle.net/JdGeQ/
[08:28:11] <dutchguy> I want to make the buttons automaticaly stretch to the window's width.
[08:28:42] <dutchguy> I would be very gratefull :)
[08:29:01] <c4ptnh00k> dutchguy: hit the jshint at the top and it will mark your errors in syntax
[08:29:52] <dutchguy> Thank you c4ptn I'll try to solve my error.
[08:29:53] <c4ptnh00k> dutchguy: it probably has to do with your objWidth being declared twice
[08:30:12] <dutchguy> Yes I declared it in css but I actualy want to set it
[08:30:18] <dutchguy> not add it again
[08:30:52] <c4ptnh00k> but you are using var objWidth = 600; and var objWidth = yada yada in the same scope
[08:33:29] <^^jfc^^> hey abes, there you are mate: http://jsfiddle.net/UREff/
[08:41:59] <JimmyXander> how do I insert a string into a <code></code>?
[08:42:08] <JimmyXander> I've tried bot .text and .html
[08:42:10] <JimmyXander> neither has worked
[08:42:18] <JimmyXander> both*
[08:43:41] <Stephen> text works just fine for me
[08:43:47] <Stephen> just tried it
[08:44:05] <Stephen> so does html
[08:44:21] <Stephen> $("
[08:44:50] <Stephen> did this: $("body").append($("<code></code>")); $("code").text("hello");
[08:44:58] <Stephen> I see hello on the page
[08:52:03] <torbjorn> how can I use jquery to introduce and position a <div> roughly where another div on the page is placed?
[08:52:33] <torbjorn> I did  $('<div>').appentTo( $("body") ); // to insert it, now I just need to move it
[08:54:06] <^^jfc^^> hello there. I'm trying to create an accordion effect by using toggle. I got it, but I'd like to apply an "open" class to the expanded element, but I'm no longer able to remove the "open" class when clicking on a new element. http://jsfiddle.net/UREff/
[09:09:30] <WebDragon> jQ doesn't seem to have exists()
[09:09:35] <WebDragon> I want to write this part so I can test whether there exists in the page a #giftcards div, and if not, use $("#content .type-page .page-content") to place the new content in, instead (in case someone edits this wordpress post and summarily removes the div not understanding it's there for a reason
[09:10:01] <torbjorn> I solved it with .offset and .position
[09:10:26] <torbjorn> (@ my earlier question)
[09:10:35] <WebDragon> does one just do var foo = $("#giftcards"); and then do if (foo) { do stuff here}  ?
[09:10:58] <WebDragon> or is there a superior way to do this
[09:16:56] <c4ptnh00k> WebDragon: You just want to check if the element exists?
[09:17:15] <WebDragon> yeah, but I think I found a nifty way to do it.
[09:17:41] <WebDragon> because length returs 0/false I did this:
[09:17:49] <WebDragon> $( $("#giftcards").length ? "#giftcards" : "#content .type-page .page-content" ).append( gc[0] );
[09:18:01] <c4ptnh00k> yup.
[09:18:14] <WebDragon> slightly less readable but I commented it so it's clearer
[09:18:30] <c4ptnh00k> good code doesnt need comments
[09:18:43] <c4ptnh00k> that statement is just fine
[09:18:45] <WebDragon> agreed, but not everyone is a good code-ER
[09:19:13] <WebDragon> if I can asist them with the mental leaps that got me to where I was, more quickly, that helps make my code more maintainable
[09:19:22] <WebDragon> and I don't mean comments like //this is a var ;D
[09:19:31] <WebDragon> useful oens
[09:19:33] <WebDragon> ones*
[09:20:56] <c4ptnh00k> best practice states that concept comments should be used sparingly and description comments should never be used
[09:23:32] <WebDragon> well, have a look and see if I
[09:23:41] <WebDragon> am cluttering too much with the thought process
[09:24:21] <WebDragon> it also helps those who DON'T read code, to see what I'm doing insomuch as sometimes the client asks to see what they're paying for, and a mess of code with no comments doesn't tell them anything other than that it was complicated
[09:24:30] <WebDragon> (even when it wasn't) :D
[09:25:08] <WebDragon> http://fpaste.org/15259/13698446/
[09:25:18] <WebDragon> I still gotta write the listener but it's largely done
[09:25:57] <yogurt_truck> that's horrible
[09:25:59] <WebDragon> for a dropdown <select> I use what, in jquery to handle the onchange ?
[09:26:12] <WebDragon> of course it's horrible, I'm being rushed through the job
[09:26:44] <WebDragon> boss thinks it's WAY more complicated than it should have been, and me, I think hey even if JavaScript is disabled the guys form will still work
[09:27:15] <WebDragon> yogurt_truck: can you be more specific or are you just yanking my chain ? :)
[09:27:54] <yogurt_truck> you're writing horrible code that will slow down everyone's life the moment a bug needs to be fixed or a change is needed precisely because you're being rushed? -_-
[09:28:19] <WebDragon> *ahem* I said can you be more _specific_
[09:28:56] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: split things into little functions that have descriptive names and do one thing, also use descriptive variable names, and you won't need paragraphs of plain english comments
[09:29:30] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: i don't need to be specific, it's blatantly obvious what the awful things are
[09:29:38] <WebDragon> but I don't have paragraphs of comments. one-liners at best
[09:29:39] <yogurt_truck> you're writing "$( $("#giftcards").length ? "#giftcards" : "#content .type-page .page-content" ).append( gc[0] );", for example
[09:29:44] <yogurt_truck> that's a single line of code
[09:29:51] <WebDragon> yes
[09:29:53] <WebDragon> it is
[09:29:57] <yogurt_truck> how can it not need some comments explaining it
[09:30:06] <WebDragon> which is why there is one
[09:30:21] <WebDragon> I don't comment EVERY line of code
[09:30:22] <yogurt_truck> which is solving the symptom, not the problem
[09:30:38] <yogurt_truck> the problem is writing a line of code that doesn't express what it's doing at all
[09:30:49] <WebDragon> but that one is _specifically_ commented to call attention to the fact that the #giftcards div needs to be in that wordpress post to receive the content
[09:31:14] <WebDragon> but has been scripted such that the script will not FAIL in the instance where some fool edits the post and removes it
[09:31:47] <WebDragon> I don't see a problem with that
[09:32:05] <Ricaz> Is there a simple way I can check if a string contains any html?
[09:32:12] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: yes, reason all that you're describing, and express it in terms of a couple of little functions and variables that when used will express the intent
[09:32:31] <BillCriswell> Ricaz: Hmmm...
[09:32:38] <WebDragon> having just tried working through some developers whack-job of a Visual Basic CMS without a SINGLE line of internal commenting and trying to debug their heinous thought processes, I am one who appreciates a few thoughts sprinkled through code
[09:32:50] <BillCriswell> $el.text() === $el.html() maybe?
[09:33:06] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: that way you don't have to express the intent twice (once for the browser, in the form of a horrible unreadable line of code, and once in plain english for the poor bastard, or yourself in the future, who will have to maintain this code)
[09:33:30] <WebDragon> which particularly horrible unreadable line of code in the browser are you referring to ? ;P
[09:33:39] <WebDragon> now you're just inflating
[09:33:48] <BillCriswell> Ricaz: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3052052/how-to-find-if-string-contains-html-data might also help.
[09:33:58] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: all of them, but specifically the one I told you about
[09:34:10] <c4ptnh00k> Ricaz: A nieve way is to look for "<", but like i said that is very nieve
[09:34:40] <WebDragon> how exactly is that line so horrible and unreadable?
[09:35:02] <WebDragon> it EXACTLY expresses the intent as succinctly as possible instead of a much longer if then else
[09:36:11] * WebDragon decides to stop letting himself be trolled and moves on to write the event listener as he is actually still under a time constraint to wrap this up 
[09:36:24] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: you're contradicting yourself. you agreed the line is unreadable the moment you wrote a long line of comment code above it to explain what it's going on
[09:36:47] <WebDragon> no, the comment is there specifically to point out the need for the #giftcards div to exist in the post content
[09:37:19] <WebDragon> in the instance it gets deleted and people wonder why suddenly the giftcard block is showing up UNDER all the rest of the content, I can come back months later and go OH this is why
[09:37:30] <WebDragon> you deleted the div *headsmack* (puts it back) there, fixed
[09:37:44] <WebDragon> to save ME time
[09:38:06] <WebDragon> but enough o this...
[09:38:16] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: I'm just telling you you should write self documenting code instead of unreadable gibberish surrounded by plain english comments
[09:38:35] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: but go ahead and keep writing code the way you are now. good luck with that :)
[09:39:07] <WebDragon> you're absolutely write and I should definitely leave that line of code EXACTLY as it is, because any further attempts to DE obfuscate its intent would serve to do the opposite and make the code longer
[09:39:19] <WebDragon> s/write/right/
[09:39:21] <shoky> and the comments shorter
[09:39:33] <WebDragon> than one line? O_o
[09:39:34] <rosieres> I put a <div> with before() an <img> with same position. how do I prevent loosing my mouseover on the <img> ? Even if I put the mouseover to that new <div> I get quick mouseleave mouseenter states on mousemovement. Event tried hoverIntent but that didn´t make it perfect  ....
[09:39:38] <shoky> yes, zero
[09:40:03] <WebDragon> to each their own
[09:40:09] <yogurt_truck> WebDragon: what's wrong with longer code? you're confusing readability with code length. more expressive code doesn't mean verbose code.
[09:40:33] <rosieres> the div has a scattered transparent background
[09:40:33] <BillCriswell> rosieres: Sure you wouldn't want prepend()?
[09:40:42] <WebDragon> having, as I said, tried to deal with someone else's uncommented NIGHTMARE of a visual basic app CMS thing, I don't feel bad about occasional comments that are short
[09:41:07] <WebDragon> this is a debate that will never end
[09:41:12] <WebDragon> I am ending it
[09:41:36] <shoky> for now
[09:41:45] <WebDragon> moving on to what I need to know next, that being what jquery uses to detect when a <select> is used..
[09:41:51] <BillCriswell> rosieres: If you do $('.divWithMouseoverFunction').prepend('<img src="foo.jpg"/>') it'll put the img inside the div, doing .before() will put it outside the div.
[09:41:54] <WebDragon> presumably that being .change() ?
[09:42:00] <WebDragon> or onchange() ?
[09:42:02] <rosieres> BillCriswell: what happens to an list of 200 images and I prepend to one in the middle ?
[09:42:22] <rosieres> I dont want to wrap something.
[09:42:28] <BillCriswell> WebDragon: .on('change', fn ) would be the best bet dependin what version you're using.
[09:42:51] <shoky> unless it's <1.7 :P
[09:42:54] <BillCriswell> rosieres: It would do it to each div... Not sure I'm understanding properly.
[09:43:01] <WebDragon> 1.8.whicheveriscurrent until I move to the 1.9/2.x fully sure I can safely do so
[09:43:29] <WebDragon> need to look over client's Analytics first
[09:43:56] <WebDragon> .on() was the thing they replaced .live() with, right?
[09:44:03] <rosieres> BillCriswell: <img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><img /><div/ id="here I place a Div with the Size and position of the next image"><img /><img />
[09:44:49] <shoky> WebDragon: .on() can replace .live(), .bind(), and .delegate()
[09:44:52] <BillCriswell> WebDragon: Yes. and bind() I believe.
[09:44:53] <shoky> not just .live()
[09:44:55] <BillCriswell> Yeah, all that jazz.
[09:45:14] <WebDragon> oh nice.
[09:45:28] <shoky> but .live() is the one that was also deprecated and removed in 1.89
[09:45:29] <shoky> 1.9
[09:45:40] <WebDragon> *nod* good to know
[09:45:47] <shoky> you need to use .on() in a certain way to mimic .live() tho
[09:45:54] <BillCriswell> rosieres: You lost me. =)
[09:46:02] <rosieres> BillBriswell: But you brought me to the idea to wrap that image with the div and just to animate the background
[09:46:12] <WebDragon> that would make some sense. but .on('change', fn) should be easy enough to grok
[09:46:13] <BillCriswell> Animate backgrond?
[09:47:16] <BillCriswell> background*!*!*!*!
[09:47:23] <bet0x> Hello all, i need some help related to pull information inside a div, an example is this: $("#estadistica").sparkline([5,6,7,9,9,5,3,2,2,4,6,7], {type: 'line'});
[09:47:25] <BillCriswell> Not sure if it's my keyboard being weird or my fingers.
[09:47:58] <bet0x> i want the result of $("#estadistica").load('/collector/testing'); inside sparkline but dunno how do that
[09:48:29] <rosieres> BillCriswell: That´s the intention of my doing . . . I want the image overlayd with a scattered semitransparent layer . . . with some animation . . .
[09:48:34] <iki144> Hello does anyone know how can i make regular content editable div act as a textarea ?
[09:48:38] <c4ptnh00k> Need a little logic help here. this is an example of a dynamically created table and I need to find the id of the textbox in the data column given that I know the Value of the columns column  http://jsfiddle.net/c4ptnh00k/VZtkT/
[09:48:48] <BillCriswell> bet0x: You can pass a second function to load() for the success callback and run sparkline in there.
[09:49:39] <c4ptnh00k> im thinking i use .find()
[09:49:46] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Don't see the id?
[09:49:47] <iki144> hey billcriswell did not see you for a while
[09:49:59] <bet0x> BillCriswell can you expand the answer please, im quite new on this
[09:50:08] <BillCriswell> iki144: Oh I'm here.
[09:50:20] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Thats because it will be generated at runtime
[09:50:32] <BillCriswell> bet0x: What I think you want to do is load content then run a plugin on it?
[09:50:50] <c4ptnh00k> not in my mockup though. just need to know how to look for it and store it in a variable
[09:51:33] <bet0x> well im doing a rand wich generate this: <!--1,2,4,6,5,2,5-->
[09:51:38] <yogurt_truck> c4ptnh00k: you could use .closest to find the option's parent td then use .siblings to get .data and grab its input
[09:51:59] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I'm not sure I was following right.
[09:52:00] <bet0x> then i load with jquery using a setInterval but when i do that the canvas doesn't get generated
[09:52:15] <bet0x> and if i remove the fresh and manually insert the code inside the div it works
[09:52:24] <iki144> bill yeah i see i havent been here for a while but run throught a problem and i cant really make something what i need to wihtout content editable div
[09:52:38] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: var id = $(this).closest('tr').find('td:eq(3) input').eq(0).attr('id'); maybe?
[09:53:09] <yogurt_truck> c4ptnh00k: roughly $option.closest('td').siblings('.data').find('input[type=text]').attr('id')
[09:53:25] <BillCriswell> bet0x: Do $('#whatever').load('/foo/bar', function(){ $('.whatever').plugin(); });
[09:53:59] <c4ptnh00k> I have a grid and it will populate these tables in my search abd it will automatically assign the id at runtime. I basically just want the id of the textbox when the column option of "ClientName" is selected.
[09:54:21] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: .closest('tr').find('input[type=text]').attr('id') would keep it the least reliant on the HTML.
[09:54:54] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: ty I will go from there
[09:55:17] <bet0x> BillCriswell what '.whatever' represents?
[09:55:29] <BillCriswell> bet0x: Whatever elements you want to run the plugin on.
[09:56:04] <BillCriswell> $(this).sparkline() may do the trick for you? I'd have to play around with load a bit to make sure I understood what "this" is there.
[09:56:53] <BillCriswell> iki144: I'm not too familiar with playing with contenteditable divs. I'd imagine you just read the .text() of the element like you would an inputs .val() ?
[09:56:57] <BillCriswell> I could be wrong though.
[09:57:10] <TrentonDAdams> I would like to bind the change event, but only after it's been automatically fired after page load.  e.g. I want one of my bindings to fire, but not the other.  How would I go about doing that?
[09:58:13] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: So you want to fire $('foo').on('change') but not the later $('foo').on('change')?
[09:59:15] <bet0x> can i do something like: var myvalues = $("#estadistica").load("/collector/testing");
[09:59:29] <TrentonDAdams> I want to fire foo's change, but not bar's change.  bar's change should fire on subsequent fires
[09:59:38] <bet0x> BillCriswell can i do that? because the other way didn't work
[10:00:10] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: Also, bar and foo change handlers are kind of independent, so I don't really want to couple them.
[10:01:22] <BillCriswell> bet0x: What was the error? Just saying it "didn't work" usually results in cranky people.
[10:01:39] <codingkevin> is there a quick and dirty way to determien why an event isn't firing on an element?
[10:01:49] <codingkevin> to determine, what, if anything, is blocking the event?
[10:02:32] <bet0x> BillCriswell i'm triying to load an echo using sparkline plugin: http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-docs
[10:03:00] <bet0x> the issue there is that my data is dynamic (i'm emulating something like real time data using interval).
[10:03:23] <bet0x> when i update using load the content of my div i don't get the result what i expected (those tiny sexy bars)
[10:03:41] <bet0x> but when i do add the data manually inside the div and refresh i do see the proper result
[10:03:46] <bet0x> wich is weird
[10:04:11] <bet0x> bcz on the manual method the data is process (canvas tag as result after browser load the page
[10:04:28] <bet0x> but on load i don't get the canvas stuff then no bars as result
[10:05:07] <eph3meral> sorry if OT/x-post but with backbone layout manager has anyone encountered "Using `el: false` with multiple top level elements is not supported. " even when still having only one element in the template for that view?
[10:05:41] <rosieres> how would I implement a function after before(); has applied ? before('myfoo',function(){some};); goes out of bounds :-)
[10:05:48] <bet0x> BillCriswell this is what i do: <div class="sparkline big" data-color="blue" id="estadistica"></div> and this is the example by default: <div class="sparkline big" data-color="green"><!--1,2,3,4,5,6,7--></div> when i o execute the second one i get the fancy bars, but with mine i don't get it
[10:05:52] <shoky> codingkevin: no. but you can try putting breakpoints in relevant places.. and find those with what devtools offer you.. e.g. in chrome there's "Event Listeners" section for each element, or you can try using the timeline, or if it's all jquery events you can try $._data(element, 'events') to see bound listeners
[10:06:29] <shoky> rosieres:  x.before(whatever);  doSomething();
[10:06:31] <BillCriswell> bet0x: You have to run plugin after the content is loaded, which is what the second parameter of .load() can be for. So $('div').load('/some.html', function(){ /* some HTML is loaded. You can run plugins on this content now. */ });
[10:07:16] <shoky> rosieres: .before() is not async
[10:07:16] <rosieres> that is applied @ same time
[10:07:25] <shoky> no, it is applied afterwards
[10:07:35] <codingkevin> shoky: great - i'll check there first.  thanks.
[10:08:05] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: So you have any ideas? :(
[10:09:37] <rosieres> shoky: I don´t want to make you angry. but the function I run afterward depends on the before created element. And it working @ the second call, when before really was true. But I´d like to run it @ first call . . .
[10:09:56] <shoky> rosieres: lol why would i be angry
[10:10:37] <shoky> rosieres: but i didnt understand your last sentence at all
[10:11:51] <shoky> rosieres: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DxNCK/   see, it happens afterwards. (otherwise $('#b') wouldn't find anything)
[10:11:54] <rosieres> The function I run after before(); Depends on the object that before(); creates. And it´s not true @ first call. It´s true @ second call, when the Element is really there
[10:12:10] <iki144> BillCriswell http://jsfiddle.net/jGHMk/ i see what you mean its tricky like on this example you think it would work but it wont make a request, is there any way its possible to use regular textarea on top of it or someting like that, basically waht im looking for is when the user types #word its gonna color it but the rest of the text would be a diffrent color
[10:12:15] <shoky> rosieres: when .before() has returned, the element has already been added.
[10:13:05] <shoky> rosieres: if you have scripts running in the .before() or css animations or something async, then that is another story (which you'd need to tell)
[10:14:10] <rosieres> shoky: perhaps because I have calculated positions in my before . . . and the calculation comes from $(this) which resides in a 100 Images large list . .
[10:14:33] <shoky> rosieres: i don't know what you're doing, but what i said remains true
[10:15:03] <shoky> make a jsfiddle if you have a problem
[10:15:47] <mangololo> Hello, jquery beginner here. i want to display in real time the position of my mouse on my webpage. for that i was adviced to put some random div element in my page with an id and to put between <script> this : $('#idOfMyDiv').html(myVarThatHoldsMousePosition);
[10:15:53] <mangololo> but it doesnt work
[10:16:12] <shoky> `demo @ mangololo
[10:16:20] <shoky> ?demo @ mangololo
[10:16:21] <rosieres> first I´ll try with a if ($("foo").length !== 1)
[10:16:21] <bot-t> mangololo, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:16:52] <bet0x> BillCriswell can i show you an example of what im triying to do?
[10:18:30] <iki585> sorry lost connection
[10:19:50] <codingkevin> shoky: console.dir($('#mySelector').data('events')); is returnin undefined - despite having a $('#mySelector').on('touchstart', function(e) {  setup for it... any ideas?
[10:20:03] <shoky> codingkevin: what jquery version?
[10:20:07] <codingkevin> 1.9.1
[10:20:09] <TrentonDAdams> I would like change event X to fire on page load, but not change event Y.  I would still like change event Y to be registered AFTER X is fired on page load.  How would I do that without coupling the code together?
[10:20:19] <coldhead> mangololo: http://jsfiddle.net/rfW8U/
[10:20:23] <shoky> codingkevin: like i told you.. $._data(element, 'events')
[10:20:26] <mangololo> http://jsfiddle.net/TEyaN/
[10:20:32] <BillCriswell> bet0x: $('#estadistica').load('/collector/testing', function(){ $(this).sparkline(); }); should do what you'd like assuming you're using the plugin the right way, which I think you are.
[10:20:38] <mangololo> it works here. dont know why it doesnt on my document
[10:20:52] <codingkevin> shoky: $._data throws the old Object has not method '_data' error
[10:22:12] <mangololo> thank you coldhead for the code. mine is similar, problem might be elsewhere then
[10:22:17] <shoky> codingkevin: huh. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/DxNCK/1/
[10:22:56] <codingkevin> shoky: yeah - let me try that again.  i was doing ._data wrong.  thanks - will come back with result!
[10:23:17] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: I'm sorry dude I got sidetracked.
[10:23:25] <BillCriswell> You can use custom events.
[10:23:46] <coldhead> mangololo: the code you have doesn
[10:23:53] <coldhead> t actually seem to e using an event handler
[10:24:00] <coldhead> or the event object
[10:25:08] <mangololo> coldhead: i dont have issues fetching my data from event but i have issues printing them. thats why i didnt put the whole thing on my jsfiddle
[10:25:11] <codingkevin> shoky: ok - fixed that user error there - object is showing only 1 event, touchstart.
[10:25:47] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: No problem man, no biggie.
[10:25:48] <shoky> codingkevin: i can't help you debug your stuff without seeing it for myself
[10:26:23] <shoky> codingkevin: also i know nothing about touch events and what might cause them not to work so i might not be your guy :P
[10:26:32] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: Custom events?  change.myevent?
[10:26:40] <bet0x> BillCriswell i love you :D
[10:26:41] <codingkevin> shoky: fair enough - much appreciated :)
[10:26:48] <rosieres> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/rsysweb/DxNCK/2/
[10:27:12] <BillCriswell> bet0x: Glad I could help.
[10:27:17] <shoky> rosieres: what? your JS is broken
[10:27:37] <rosieres> shoky: yess seen
[10:28:03] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: That's what I'm thinking.
[10:28:08] <shoky> rosieres: ?
[10:28:17] <BillCriswell> I'm going to read a bit more to try and understand better though.
[10:28:28] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: I'm doing that already.  Are you saying I can ask for a firing of only one of my registered events?  I do have them named differently.
[10:28:51] <mangololo> coldhead: i think its the way i introduce jquery in my code. i added between the <head> tags this : <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script> is it good ?
[10:28:54] <rosieres> shoky: I´m retesting whats the reason here . . . with corrected JS in fiddle it works there ;-) sorry ...
[10:29:21] <shoky> rosieres: k, np
[10:29:34] <BillCriswell> TrentonDAdams: You can do $('el').trigger('change.y') without running 'change.x'.. If I'm following right.
[10:29:56] <shoky> BillCriswell: i'm not sure that's right
[10:30:16] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: lol, just found it before you posted.  Trying now.
[10:30:19] <BillCriswell> shoky: scatter brained today.
[10:31:55] <TrentonDAdams> BillCriswell: Total freakin sweetness.  Thanks.
[10:32:05] <BillCriswell> Sweet!
[10:32:29] <shoky> BillCriswell: actually yea that works, my bad
[10:33:05] <iki585> BillCriswell do you have any idea whats the best easiest way to do this ?
[10:33:38] <BillCriswell> iki585: Not really sure. =/
[10:34:31] <iki585> i never thought that highighting one specific word starting with hash tag can be so difficult lol
[10:34:34] <shoky> BillCriswell: i was thinking of  .trigger('change.y')  not firing for .on('change',..)
[10:35:42] <BillCriswell> shoky: Got you.I probably worded it weirdly.
[10:35:54] <c4ptnh00k> ... all that work and it came to me... $(this)
[10:36:03] <iki585> maybe its possible to make a div transparent or something like that to still use the textarea with the div together
[10:39:36] <BillCriswell> iki585: http://jsbin.com/iruxey/2/edit help?
[10:40:16] <jedimind> whats the problem ?
[10:41:38] <BillCriswell> jedimind: I was helping someone highlight hashtags in a div.
[10:41:50] <BillCriswell> jedimind: It was more asking if it was helping someone else lol.
[10:42:29] <jedimind> that was weird
[10:42:43] <jedimind> BillCriswell got it, i was a little confused as it's working :)
[10:43:14] <shoky> i was doubly confused as i forgot to click 'Run with JS'
[10:43:41] <BillCriswell> I'm just normally triple confused.
[10:43:55] * shoky jealous
[10:43:58] <iki585> BillCriswell Thanks :) let me try to see how it works with what i have
[10:45:10] <BillCriswell> iki585: You'd need to refine it to not get weird when a hash ends with a punctuation mark.
[10:45:35] <BillCriswell> Might have to get into some regex action sadly.
[10:47:01] <AcTiVaTe> Hey all, I'm troubleshooting a form for someone. When loading the page directly the succes function of the .ajax call triggers normally but not when I load it in a dialog from the main site.  http://pastie.org/7980460

[10:58:22] <BillCriswell> goddard: It doesn't work like that. You would need to do what you need in the callback.

[11:04:36] <offlim> http://jqueryui.com/slider/ when you slide the handler it goes outside the bar
[11:08:19] <Dewin[work]> EdwardIII: Most likely a timezone issue.
[11:08:44] <BillCriswell> Don't tell him how to party.
[11:09:27] <Dewin[work]> 2013-05-19 10PM PDT  is sometime in 2013-05-20 UTC, after all
[11:09:32] <EdwardIII> Dewin[work]: i switched it to use utc for everything though
[11:09:39] <EdwardIII> Dewin[work]: as that was my first thought
[11:09:55] <Stephen> http://plugins.jquery.com/ordinalinator/
[11:10:01] <Stephen> Because I'm awesome
[11:10:21] <clov3r> billcriswell: lol
[11:10:45] <Dewin[work]> EdwardIII: I'm not familiar with Moment, but are you sure line 6 is giving you 2013-05-20 UTC, and not 2013-05-20 in your current timezone, then converted to UTC?
[11:10:53] <iki585> BillCriswell i will be back in like an hour
[11:11:08] <BillCriswell> iki585: Ok. I'm looking at it. Might have to take a slightly different way haha
[11:11:21] <iki585> thanks so much :)
[11:12:57] <EdwardIII> Dewin[work]: i don't think so, have adjusted to show timezone adjustment: http://jsfiddle.net/edwardiii/JmzVT/4/
[11:13:09] <EdwardIII> Dewin[work]: oh wait, i see, 1 sec
[11:14:45] <EdwardIII> Dewin[work]: hrm actually struggling to figure out how to set the date after instantiation, i think you could be right
[11:15:29] <Dewin[work]> also, Moment looks like what I should have used when I ended up rolling my own.  Ah well.
[11:15:52] <EdwardIII> moment looks pretty awesome i have to say
[11:16:20] <Dewin[work]> I suspect most of the size is translations
[11:16:30] <MaxSan> im pulling my freakin hair out
[11:16:34] <MaxSan> this is simple shit
[11:16:39] <MaxSan> and I dont know why it wont wrok]
[11:17:11] <shoky> pebcak
[11:17:38] <Pupeno> Is it possible in jquery mobile to download a page through ajax and render that when clicking a link... and by page, I mean, just the div, without head, styles, javascript, etc.
[11:18:05] <BillCriswell> Ha. normalize was screwing with me.
[11:18:55] <offlim> anyone?
[11:20:14] <AcTiVaTe> Hey all, I'm troubleshooting a form for someone. When loading the page directly the succes function of the .ajax call triggers normally but not when I load it in a dialog from the main site.  http://pastie.org/7980460
[11:20:33] <shoky> offlim: http://jqueryui.com/slider/#side-scroll
[11:20:36] <BillCriswell> offlim: I'm not seeing it go outside the bar? unless I'm misunderstand that.
[11:30:52] <catcher> What's like .next() for a sibling that's a couple elements away?
[11:31:38] <shoky> catcher: .nextAll('.foo').first()
[11:31:58] <BillCriswell> catcher: .next().next().next() is more fun and terrible, though.
[11:32:37] <catcher> haha, may as well overshoot it and .prev() while I'm at it
[11:32:48] <catcher> ty shoky
[11:33:55] <AcTiVaTe> Anyone have a thought about what I typed earlier?
[11:34:07] <JohnnyCache> how do i replace all <img> in a div with their src?
[11:34:08] <JohnnyCache> 	$("#tempHtmlReplacer img").replaceWith(
[11:34:09] <JohnnyCache>     $(this).attr("src")
[11:34:09] <JohnnyCache>   );
[11:34:20] <JohnnyCache> doesnt work, it replaces the img with nothing
[11:34:45] <BillCriswell> JohnnyCache: You want to replace the src with the src?
[11:35:03] <JohnnyCache> i want to replace the element with it's src
[11:35:25] <JohnnyCache> <div><img src="hello.png"></div> ==>> <div>hello.png</div>
[11:35:36] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[11:36:36] <shoky> JohnnyCache i think you meant .replaceWith( function() { return $(this).attr('src') } )
[11:36:42] <shoky> missing the function
[11:36:50] <BillCriswell> JohnnyCache: http://jsbin.com/ahuzeq/1/edit
[11:36:57] <BillCriswell> shoky: Yeah, what shoky said.
[11:37:02] <BillCriswell> Damn him and his quickness.
[11:37:05] <JohnnyCache> epic, works :)
[11:37:06] <spillere> could anyone give me a hint on how to do this? I want to display the showOrHideDiv when clicked on the SEARCH <li>, http://pastebin.com/QrbxpJeE
[11:37:09] <JohnnyCache> :D
[11:37:19] <JohnnyCache> thanks shoky & BillCriswell :)
[11:37:25] <shoky> return this.src;  is good too
[11:37:35] <JohnnyCache> good 2 know
[11:37:44] <BillCriswell> shoky: Ah, just learned something weird.
[11:37:56] <BillCriswell> this.src returns full path, $(this).attr('src') returns relative path.
[11:38:12] <shoky> oh right, i keep forgetting that difference
[11:38:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: I just learned it. =/
[11:38:41] <BillCriswell> Good to know. I'm sure it'll bite me in the ass later.
[11:39:04] <JohnnyCache> btw
[11:39:06] <JohnnyCache> question:
[11:39:34] <JohnnyCache> is that ok to use jQuery to read attributes that i set like <img src=".." emoticon=":)" /> ?
[11:39:41] <JohnnyCache> .attr("emoticon")
[11:39:48] <JohnnyCache> will that work for all the browsers?
[11:39:49] <AcTiVaTe> loads of peeps and ont even a response to my question... /sad
[11:39:50] <BillCriswell> JohnnyCache: Should probably use data-emoticon="foo"
[11:40:11] <shoky> and .data('emoticon') to read it ^
[11:40:19] <JohnnyCache> .data?
[11:40:22] <JohnnyCache> .attr won't work?
[11:40:39] <shoky> it will
[11:40:49] <JohnnyCache> but...
[11:41:24] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: It's a lot easier to visualize what's going on with these other questions.
[11:41:28] <shoky> but .data('emoticon') is shorter than .attr('data-emoticon') , and .data() caches the result so it doesn tneed to re-access the DOM
[11:41:41] <JohnnyCache> ok
[11:41:42] <JohnnyCache> got it :)
[11:42:31] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: True.. Oh well, guess I'll fiddle some more then.
[11:43:07] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: Still, the actual URL is in the pastie so if one would really needs visuals ;)
[11:44:23] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: I'll go and check to see if the main site uses the same jQuery version as I do in the form page. Something I haven't tried :P
[11:44:24] <darkfrog> is it just me, or is there a bug in offset() that doesn't properly account for absolute positioned elements?
[11:44:59] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: Haha, very possible. I hope you're looking at the console...
[11:45:11] <shoky> darkfrog: it's not a bug without a testcase
[11:45:28] <darkfrog> hehe, fair enough
[11:46:12] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: yeah I am and the thing that puzzles me the most is that when I take the commands that are in the success function and run them in console on the main site it does what I expect.
[11:46:39] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: When running commands from console it still uses the same jQuery version as the site itself I assume?
[11:46:46] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: Yes.
[11:46:57] <Pupeno> Is it possible to make jquery mobile make a special request so that the server will only render the <div data-role="page"> instead of the whole html?
[11:47:01] <AcTiVaTe> Ok, so that rules out a version difference.... back to the drawing board..
[11:47:55] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: I just feel liek we're missing the bigger picture. The code looks fine, so it's probably something else.
[11:49:47] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: http://www.vanhoevemakelaars.nl/gratis-waardebepaling/ this is the page with the form on the main site. I can fill it in and press Verzenden (Send) and it does send the mail. But just does not process the success function. As opposed to just loading the dialog.php directly.
[11:51:08] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: Oh, it's the "gratis waardebepaling" link that shows the form in a dialog btw.
[11:52:25] <shoky> AcTiVaTe: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://web517.diana58.plusserver.de/wp-content/themes/vanhoeve2011/dialog.php. Origin http://www.vanhoevemakelaars.nl is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[11:53:14] <BillCriswell> Also, seeing "[jquery.form] terminating; zero elements found by selector"
[11:53:36] <BillCriswell> I know German even less than I thought, and I thought I didn't know any German.
[11:53:44] <shoky> that's dutch ;]
[11:53:49] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: Yeah, but that should be a different plugin and page entirely actually. It's a WP site.
[11:53:52] <AcTiVaTe> lol :P
[11:54:02] <BillCriswell> shoky: My point exactly.
[11:54:05] <shoky> hehe
[11:55:01] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: I clicked the "gratis waardebepaling" link and clicked the link in the body.
[11:56:55] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: Just make sure you're trying to do whatever with the form after the html exists in some way. Like you can't do $('.foo') then later create <div class="foo"></div>. It seems like that's the problem since when you run it in the console it works fine.
[11:57:49] <AcTiVaTe> BillCriswell: Ok, I get what you mean. Let me try it that way. Thanks :)
[11:58:48] <BillCriswell> AcTiVaTe: Welcome. I hope it works.
[12:02:02] <kzurawel> I'm going to be a TA for an intro to jQuery class this evening - if you remember, what was the thing that you had the hardest time learning about jQuery?
[12:02:34] <spillere> could anyone give me a hint on how to do this? I want to display the showOrHideDiv when clicked on the SEARCH <li>, http://pastebin.com/QrbxpJeE
[12:03:48] <kzurawel> spillere: showOrHideDiv is an ID. "div.showOrHideDiv" is selecting a div with CLASS showOrHideDiv.
[12:04:19] <kzurawel> So you want $("#showOrHideDiv") instead
[12:07:33] <JohnnyCache> question :)
[12:08:15] <BillCriswell> kzurawel: Hmmm...
[12:09:38] <BillCriswell> kzurawel: Tough one. Can't think of any right now.
[12:09:52] <JohnnyCache> http://jsfiddle.net/kWsys/2/ - how do i select only the <img> with data-emo ?
[12:10:02] <BillCriswell> I imagine selectors would be difficult if you didn't have CSS experience.
[12:10:23] <BillCriswell> JohnnyCache: img[data-emo]]
[12:10:29] <BillCriswell> Ignore that last ].
[12:10:44] <BillCriswell> So just $('img[data-emo]')
[12:11:19] <BillCriswell> kzurawel: Also, understanding siblings vs children, etc.
[12:11:50] <kzurawel> Thanks BillCriswell. Just looking for ideas of where to focus
[12:12:12] <cakiiooo> you are welcome kzurawel
[12:12:43] <JohnnyCache> BillCriswell: gracias :)
[12:12:49] <BillCriswell> JohnnyCache: No problem
[12:12:59] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any better way to unescape HTML than this? $('#uploadedFiles_{{ order.orderid }}').html($('#uploadedFiles_{{ order.orderid }}').html($('#uploadedFiles_{{ order.orderid }}').html()).text());
[12:14:13] <shoky> you can use .text() as a setter too
[12:14:39] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy: by "unescape" do you mean & -> &amp;, or the other way around?
[12:14:49] <DeltaHeavy> Other way around.
[12:15:47] <Schonert> Any experience with stellar.js?
[12:16:47] <cakiiooo> NO STELLARS
[12:17:35] <kzurawel> DeltaHeavy: my guess would be 1) store $('#blah').html() as a string; 2) use $('<div></div>').html(string).text()
[12:20:13] <Boredcodemonkey> Quick question. My company is trying to set up a website which interacts with a PoS legacy server which sends and recieves its HTTP Headers without a
[12:20:18] <Boredcodemonkey> ':'
[12:20:48] <Boredcodemonkey> Is their anyway I can send requests to the server via javascript as : in the headers break the request
[12:20:50] <Boredcodemonkey> ugh
[12:21:16] <DeltaHeavy> kzurawel: That seems like moer work
[12:21:53] <Boredcodemonkey> I don't think there is anyway, but I figure it's best to doublecheck before I say I can't
[12:22:05] <coldhead> that definitely shouldn't be jquery's problem. i would do a proxy on that server that takes NORMAL CORRECT REQUESTS and breaks them in the wrong way required
[12:22:15] <coldhead> so that there's a single point that handles this broken shit
[12:22:21] <coldhead> instead of having to mess with it in the client
[12:22:25] <coldhead> IF THAT IS EVEN POSSIBLE
[12:23:05] <iki775> BillCriswell hello im back
[12:23:12] <BillCriswell> iki775: Howdy.
[12:23:31] <BillCriswell> So, funny tying is that script was working. It was just the "normalize css" option.
[12:23:37] <Boredcodemonkey> I agree. I just asked to see if I could do it so I just want to make sure I can't
[12:23:51] <iki775> im good had to leave for a while to get something
[12:24:02] <iki775> oh wow
[12:24:14] <BillCriswell> iki775: Yeah, it was driving me nuts for a while.
[12:24:26] <BillCriswell> Their "normalize css" option is more like a "reset".
[12:24:35] <iki775> o.0 who would ever know it could have been the css problem wow
[12:25:08] <iki775> good job figuring this out
[12:25:10] <BillCriswell> I tweeted them or whatever so maybe they'll look into that.
[12:25:19] <BillCriswell> iki775: ha, thanks.
[12:26:09] <iki775> could you send the new fiddle ?
[12:26:58] <cakiiooo> kiddufiddle
[12:27:50] <BillCriswell> iki775: I don't have it open anymore lol
[12:28:24] <BillCriswell> My scroll history doesn't go that far back either. Might be on the IRC logs at the site.
[12:28:39] <iki775> ohhh
[12:28:53] <iki775> do you remember where was the css problem
[12:29:02] <iki775> i still have the old fiddle
[12:29:45] <iki775> http://jsfiddle.net/jGHMk/2/
[12:31:15] <BillCriswell> iki775: It was just the "normalize css" option under "Fiddle Options", here it is without that option: http://jsfiddle.net/jGHMk/3/
[12:33:27] <`e> hi
[12:34:02] <iki775> BillCriswell now this works the problem is that when i remove the text from the html part it wont detect the #word and highlight it
[12:34:43] <BillCriswell> iki775: Not following you.
[12:34:52] <iki775> also what is really tricky is when you write something like "noraml text #bold normal text " that #bold should be the only bold part of the whole sentence
[12:36:39] <iki775> http://jsfiddle.net/jGHMk/6/ try to type something in the textarea that starts with #, sorry this whole thing is like a nightmare
[12:38:37] <BillCriswell> iki775: http://jsfiddle.net/jGHMk/8/ going for that kind of?
[12:39:34] <cakiiooo> in the djungle the might djungle, the lions sleeps tonight
[12:40:20] <Interbit> hello
[12:40:45] <BillCriswell> iki775: I tried it with keyup but it did not seem to like that and I didn't have the time to really grok what was going on.
[12:42:13] <iki775> BillCriswell im not sure if im explaining this right if you remove everything from the html part "somewrewr #this #foo whatever #dudes man" >>> this and leave the div empty and then try to write something that has #something this is the only thing that should make it bold and leave the rest text plain black
[12:42:30] <iki775> thats not problem, just let me know when you have some time
[12:43:12] <BillCriswell> iki775: I'm not seeing that. I can edit it and blur it then it'll adjust what's highlighted .
[12:43:13] <iki775> maybe we can try to figure out this tomorrow or something, sometimes best is when taking a break, i know this is tricky lol
[12:43:42] <zergion> http://pastebin.com/vSv912Zv why can't I change the data: action to something else?
[12:43:47] <BillCriswell> iki775: Type whatever you want in that div and click somewhere else. It'll highlight the # words.
[12:43:58] <zergion> I can only use $_POST['action'], I wanna rename it.
[12:44:34] <iki775> oh yeah i see now
[12:44:35] <diamonds> is it advisable to use context/delegation for all events?
[12:44:52] <iki775> yes i see what you mean i had to click on something
[12:44:59] <cakiiooo> what would happen if a jquery dev put a dick in the asshole of his special ladyfriend?
[12:45:04] <diamonds> $('body').on('click','.foo',function....)
[12:45:14] <dumbdell> updating the dom directly will be quicker then using .css() or is it negligable?
[12:45:19] <BillCriswell> iki775: I can only get it working smoothly with blur events. I tried keyup but it was weird.
[12:45:24] <diamonds> ty ajpiano
[12:45:30] <iki775> is there any event that would do it automatically without clicking anywhere cuz the next thing the user would click would be send so he might not be able to see it
[12:45:36] <iki775> ohhh
[12:45:37] <iki775> ok
[12:45:38] <iki775> i see
[12:45:45] <BillCriswell> I have a built in ability to ignore those people. I just had to look and see what he did haha
[12:46:06] <WebDragon> heh
[12:46:07] <diamonds> put another way, is there ever a reason NOT to delegate a click event?
[12:46:17] <diamonds> I read some article about how great delegation is...
[12:46:35] <iki775> BillCriswell thanks, i will try to see if i can do something with the submit thing and work on it
[12:46:44] <ajpiano> i didn't even see any of the other stuff, just glanced over and saw his last line, that's an obvious kb
[12:46:52] <WebDragon> though .delegate as well as .bind and .live were replaced with .on (I knew about live but had forgotten the other two and thanks for the reminder earlier, folks)
[12:46:59] <ajpiano> folks please ping me if that sort of stuff crops up
[12:47:04] <ajpiano> again
[12:47:06] <WebDragon> ajpiano++
[12:47:32] <BillCriswell> Will do.
[12:47:51] <dumbdell> the high horse has been ridden
[12:48:00] <b-ot> cakiiooo: The dick is u
[12:48:04] <BillCriswell> diamonds: delegation is.....
[12:48:25] <Stephen> BillCriswell: Complicated
[12:48:52] <dumbdell> updating the dom directly will be quicker then using .css() <-- you that function that every one uses in Jquery? ... #or is it negligable?
[12:49:03] <diamonds> WebDragon» yes but you can delegate with .on by suppying a selector as arg2
[12:49:14] <Interbit> so when I do     $("uploadForm").submit( function () {
[12:49:14] <Interbit>     });
[12:49:24] <diamonds> BillCriswell» go on....
[12:49:24] <WebDragon> yes .. but my point was the other three are deprecated now
[12:49:50] <WebDragon> so all useful discussion should revolve around how to do it with .on( ...
[12:49:57] <diamonds> ok
[12:49:59] <diamonds> I am using on
[12:50:09] <WebDragon> me admits to some curiosity about delegation having never really used it
[12:50:12] <Stephen> diamonds: There is 1 problem with delegation
[12:50:14] <WebDragon> oops forgot a /
[12:50:16] <diamonds> anyway I like how mass unbinding by namespace is easy
[12:50:36] <diamonds> $body.off('.mynamespace') unbind all the delegated events :)
[12:50:47] <Stephen> diamonds: it specifically has to do with one uses $.proxy to define the handler
[12:51:31] <Stephen> diamonds: It will effectively block anyone else from using another event handler on those elements
[12:52:04] <diamonds> oh?
[12:52:10] <Stephen> correction: delegated handlers on the same element and selector
[12:52:52] <Stephen> Yeah, I ran into this yesterday with someone in here trying to add a click handler on a td in a calendar extension
[12:53:09] <Stephen> He set the delegate properly
[12:53:14] <Stephen> But it never fired.
[12:53:55] <Stephen> We set it on a child div, same selector (td), and it worked
[12:54:07] <Stephen> turned out that a previous delegate was taking precidence
[12:54:23] <Stephen> and blocking the one we added
[12:54:47] <rmill> OH SHI-
[12:54:50] <dumbdell> heheh
[12:54:55] <dumbdell> Karma
[12:54:59] <Stephen> I'm not sure if that's an intended behaviour, the only thing I could track it back to was that the handler was being created as a $.proxy (privately scoped function)
[12:55:15] <diamonds> Stephen» http://jsbin.com/eyemax/1/edit
[12:55:29] <diamonds> all three appear to work
[12:55:30] <Stephen> lmfao
[12:55:46] <diamonds> ??
[12:56:11] <diamonds> when your fa settles down let me know if that example is what you're talking about :)
[12:56:12] <Stephen> Yeah, it's more complicated than that
[12:56:26] <Stephen> the function you supply there
[12:57:03] <Stephen> The way it was done in this situation was being supplied via a proxy object
[12:57:03] <zergion> prepare for a shitstorm
[12:57:11] <AphelionZ_> po hay whats goin on in here
[12:57:17] <Stephen> zergion: ?
[12:57:37] <diamonds> Stephen» well i guess I don't know what you mean... sounds like it doesn't apply to my situation
[12:57:47] <Stephen> ok
[12:57:56] <BillCriswell> zergion: Say what?
[12:58:28] <Stephen> diamonds: You were just wanting to know about situations one "shouldn't" use delegation?
[12:58:48] <diamonds> stephan yes but I still don't get what your situation was :(
[12:58:53] <Stephen> That's ok
[12:58:54] <diamonds> maybe you can illustrate on that fiddle?
[12:59:23] <diamonds> it sounded like you were saying "if you delegate bind via .on, you can't bind to that event a sedcond time"
[12:59:29] <diamonds> I couldn't reproduce that
[12:59:35] <diamonds> but I probably misunderstood
[12:59:53] <`e\afk> if I serialize() a series of input checkboxes, i have &name=val&name=val etc
[12:59:57] <Stephen> I'd just say this: Don't use delegation if you don't have to. Put it directly on the element. Delegation is best in situations where one is create/destroying a lot of child objects, or when there are so many child objects that the memory used by the handlers becomes relevant
[12:59:59] <`e\afk> the name is all the same
[13:00:16] <`e\afk> when I receive them in the php it's a problem
[13:00:50] <`e\afk> there's a way to work with those values putting them into an array, for example?
[13:00:54] <BillCriswell> `e\afk: Can you make your name any more ifficult to type?
[13:01:03] <Stephen> `e\afk: create the series of checkboxes with names that look like an array
[13:01:10] <BillCriswell> `e\afk: Do name="name[]"
[13:01:19] <Stephen> `e\afk: name[0], name[1] and so on
[13:01:28] <`e\afk> uh i'll try, thanks
[13:02:18] <Stephen> diamonds: here's the fiddle we were working with
[13:02:19] <Stephen> http://jsfiddle.net/K3v2d/26/
[13:02:36] <Stephen> diamonds: of significance is line 209 in bootstrap-datepicker.js
[13:03:07] <Stephen> diamonds: and line 729 in jquery-git2.js
[13:04:50] <BillCriswell> `e\afk: http://jsbin.com/ewazel/1/edit will give you an array in PHP.
[13:05:16] <Stephen> There should be a bot which records all the links to fiddles/bins posted here
[13:05:30] <Stephen> So much goodness to learn
[13:05:43] <`e\afk> :)
[13:06:05] <`e\afk> so when I receive the parameters
[13:06:08] <`e\afk> uhm
[13:06:39] <`e\afk> uh wait, i'll try thanks
[13:06:40] <BillCriswell> and I imagine most other languages haha
[13:07:00] <BillCriswell> `e\afk: $_GET['name'][0] will return the first one, and so on.
[13:07:22] <`e\afk> Thanks :D So so so much
[13:07:29] <BillCriswell> `e\afk: No problem.
[13:08:09] <`e\afk> It's 2 days i'm working on a fucking automatic generated table created by dynamic queries on a postgres db (i hate postgres)
[13:08:13] <Stephen> `e\afk: Don't forget to clean those values buddy! Always remember: User input is dangerous to simply display or dump directly to db's
[13:08:16] <`e\afk> My brain smokes
[13:08:18] <Stephen> `e\afk: enjoy
[13:08:28] <Stephen> OOh, wow
[13:08:36] <Stephen> My comment was relevant before I read that
[13:08:37] <Stephen> sweet
[13:09:26] <BillCriswell> I actually prefer to append: '); DROP TABLE users; to all inputs!
[13:09:31] <BillCriswell> Just kidding don't do that.
[13:09:42] <`e\afk> Ya, the user has to make choices and the software has to give him a table with results
[13:09:44] <Stephen> Little Bobby Drop Tables
[13:10:08] <Stephen> `e\afk: And if I alter the URL you posted to the server manually?
[13:10:13] <BillCriswell> My favorite XKCD or however you spell tha.
[13:10:21] <charas> I am making a website responsive but when a user changes orientation of device, soem elements do not get refreshed wrt to the new resolution.
[13:10:21] <BillCriswell> oh I got it right that time.
[13:10:24] <BillCriswell> Score one for Bill.
[13:10:34] <charas> Is there any jquery script which letsy ou refresh items for these cases?
[13:10:42] <kzurawel> charas: what do you mean by "refresh"?
[13:11:09] <`e\afk> stephen, i'm working on a private software, it'll be run only locally
[13:11:13] <`e\afk> by technicians
[13:11:16] <charas> kzurawel: By refresh I mean if I opened menu in 320px resolution it looks fine but when I move to 480px resolution it shows menu in the position of 320[x
[13:11:22] <Stephen> `e\afk
[13:11:49] <charas> Since the orientation has changed I want the menu to follow the CSS of 480px I wrote for it
[13:11:58] <`e\afk> so I'm not thinking a lot on security (they even asked me why I used sha1 to encrypt db saved passwords)
[13:11:59] <kzurawel> charas: Generally you'll want to make your site responsive by using media queries in your CSS, those should update automatically
[13:12:06] <Stephen> `e\afk: Fair enough if you feel safe. But always keep in mind that you don't know the behavior of everyone, especially future new hires. Taking a little time to add scrubbing is prudent
[13:12:22] <kzurawel> charas: Do you have a fiddle / is your site live so I can take a look?
[13:12:27] <charas> kzurawel: I am using media queries and they are not updating, that's teh problem. Sorry i DIDN;T PHRASE IT WELL
[13:12:33] <charas> kzurawel: Sure
[13:13:28] <NoiseEee> charas: typical gotchas are a lack of <meta name="viewport" ..etc..> tag
[13:13:29] <`e\afk> Every db access, edit, add, etc are handled by ajax in POST, so...
[13:13:45] <NoiseEee> charas: which should supply width, scale, etc
[13:13:49] <`e\afk> you can even try to make request to the db only if you have ftp access and know what page does what
[13:13:50] <charas> kzurawel: I am using Firefox's Responsive deisgn view to test it. http://sushi-mashi.appspot.com/reservebar/index2.html this is the URL
[13:14:11] <charas> When you open the menu in 320px it is fine but when you change resolution to 480px then menu appears in the same place as 320px
[13:14:28] <charas> NoiseEee: This is the URL http://sushi-mashi.appspot.com/reservebar/index2.html
[13:14:32] <BillCriswell> charas: Is the menu absolutely positioned?
[13:14:58] <kzurawel> charas: Are you writing your media queries from small to large, or large to small?
[13:14:59] <charas> BillCriswell: Yeah
[13:15:07] <charas> large to small
[13:15:38] <kzurawel> charas: Your media queries are all "max-width", meaning that if the screen is small (say 320px), all of your CSS rules in all media queries will apply
[13:16:48] <charas> kzurawel: Any way to fix this now?
[13:17:16] <charas> without having to write it small to large
[13:18:04] <kzurawel> charas: You could try to change the order of your media queries - keep everything the same but make max-width: 320px come first, then max-width: 360px, etc.
[13:18:22] <kzurawel> charas: That might fix it. Essentially since all the rules apply, whichever one is listed last wins
[13:18:59] <charas> I will try that
[13:22:31] <_Cody> possible to display an html-exactly under the cursor after a keypress event?
[13:22:50] <_Cody> html-element of course like div or img
[13:23:11] <dumbdell> _Cody cant see why not..
[13:23:45] <_Cody> so there exist cursor events. thank you

[13:24:13] <dogarrhea> it's basically the diet..
[13:24:29] <dogarrhea> all these new diseases and h1n1 h5n1 and sars and bird flu and what not in china..
[13:24:47] <astro73|roam> My form is submitting, and the server is either returning a redirect or a 205 Reset Content (causing chrome to mark the request as cancelled). Is there a way to detect this failed submission so I can throw up an error message?
[13:24:53] <dogarrhea> you don't get these diseases if you don't eat south east asian pangolins rats, dogs, horses, and what not. French people eat strange things too.

[13:32:54] <dumbdell> _Cody just so your clear a carrot != cursor/pointer
[13:33:34] <dogarrhea> Stephen, the vaccines are made by doing research in china on what diseases people are getting

[13:40:15] <c4ptnh00k> question when I use $(elem).datepicker(); should it automatically select the date i click on?
[13:40:53] <dogarrhea> I'm east asian so there's already some level of immunity since my ancestors have been doing this crap for years. eating rats (bubonic plague) eating jungle fowl (h1n1 bird flu etc) eating cats (rabies) etc.
[13:40:54] <dumbdell> i cant give you a scientific endorsement dogarrhea but i think youre theory might well hold some validity
[13:41:22] <vsync_> rgr: agreed, but internet is filled with that. Best case in point is the internet-too much time on their hands-conspiracy theorists

[13:46:38] <vsync_> ...and really love people pointing that out, so that other people can point that out, and it's really just a vicious cycle

[13:57:44] <goddard> how can i prevent my filter from running if it finds 1 filed empty
[13:57:53] <goddard> it goes through all elements
[13:57:56] <c4ptnh00k> because in dev tools I get this error "Uncaught Missing instance data for this datepicker" when I click on a date
[13:58:03] <goddard> i tried return false;
[14:06:44] <granden_> Can I have nested $.GET?
[14:07:13] <granden_> In the .done for the first have a new $.GET?
[14:15:11] <srji> jqmobile: if a 'button' doesn't has a href (or it has href="#"), why jqmobile doesn't set the css class 'ui-btn-up' on that element?
[14:20:51] <shoky> granden_: if you mean $.get  then yes
[14:24:36] <BillCriswell> granden_: Can also look into .then(). req1.then(req2).done()
[14:24:55] <granden_> Hmm, what would be the difference?
[14:25:44] <BillCriswell> granden_: Probably not much to be honest.
[14:26:43] <shoky> don't think you can do .then(req2) ..
[14:26:59] <shoky> if req2 is already defined that means you've already sent the request
[14:27:20] <AlexMPS> Hello
[14:27:23] <shoky> could pass a function tho
[14:28:52] <AlexMPS> Why is the div not sliding down when going to Producten?
[14:28:53] <AlexMPS> http://alex.sna-webo.be/katrien2/index.html
[14:28:59] <AlexMPS> Should be simple :s
[14:29:22] <Eviltwin> shoky: Yeah, last example here: http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/
[14:29:51] <BillCriswell> shoky: I was thinking wrong.
[14:30:42] <shoky> Eviltwin: yeah, passing a function
[14:32:58] <shoky> AlexMPS: first of all, you only have the click hander set in the producten page, not in the 1st page
[14:33:03] <BillCriswell> Man, that's so much uglier.
[14:33:44] <AlexMPS> True, didn't think that would matter
[14:34:17] <shoky> AlexMPS: 2nd, you need to call .preventDefault() on the event argument to the click handler if you don't want it to redirect to a new page
[14:34:44] <shoky> AlexMPS: of course it matters, you're doing the click on the 1st page, not the 2nd
[14:35:13] <AlexMPS> ok will try to fix it with the new info, thanks
[14:36:17] <goddard> how can i prevent my filter from running if it finds 1 filed empty
[14:36:20] <goddard> it goes through all elements
[14:36:21] <goddard> i tried return false;
[14:36:49] <shoky> goddard: don't think you can, with jquery's filter
[14:37:16] <shoky> and obviously return false won't work.. filter depends on the boolean return value
[14:37:39] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/7VsKH/
[14:37:58] <shoky> huh.
[14:38:03] <shoky> why are you using .filter ?
[14:38:59] <shoky> goddard: i think you want .each , not .filter
[14:41:30] <hxm> where do i fail?      var regex = '/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/';
[14:41:30] <hxm>         if(validate_form_field($(this), $(this).val() != '' && regex.test($(this).val()) === false)) {

[15:12:40] <JohnnyCache> is it possible that replaceWith() has a problem to replace inner elements? or something like that?
[15:13:01] <JohnnyCache> because if i have <blockquote> <blockquote> <blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>
[15:13:05] <JohnnyCache> it misses the third one
[15:13:06] <JohnnyCache> :S
[15:22:01] <JohnnyCache> http://jsfiddle.net/LRUtw/8/
[15:22:04] <JohnnyCache> can u see this?
[15:24:22] <shoky> JohnnyCache: as soon as the first <blockquote> is replaced, the 2 other <blockquote>'s are gone
[15:24:43] <JohnnyCache> :\
[15:24:51] <JohnnyCache> any solution to that?
[15:25:02] <shoky> JohnnyCache: er sorry, what i said's wrong
[15:25:22] <shoky> JohnnyCache: they're not gone, but they're replaced with new ones
[15:25:25] <JohnnyCache> i hope my explanation is ok
[15:25:29] <JohnnyCache> ok
[15:25:30] <shoky> it's fine
[15:25:51] <JohnnyCache> it's not replacing all of them
[15:26:04] <JohnnyCache> :(
[15:26:52] <shoky> because they have been replaced so the original jquery object which had the 3 blockquotes now points to removed elements
[15:27:07] <shoky> by replacing the first one, you also replace its contents
[15:27:27] <JohnnyCache> i see
[15:27:28] <shoky> you'd need to re-select the inner blockquotes
[15:27:36] <JohnnyCache> that means
[15:27:50] <JohnnyCache> run a while loop until i see the new content == old content? :)
[15:28:16] <JohnnyCache> or maybe there's a better way to do that
[15:28:44] <shoky> here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/LRUtw/10/   there are probably better ways
[15:30:50] <JohnnyCache> it works good for me :)
[15:31:06] <JohnnyCache> but i have about 10 elements that i replace, should i do that for all of them?
[15:31:19] <JohnnyCache> like b,i,u

[15:52:35] <Rejected> hi there. this is probably rather easy but I'm having trouble with it. I want to clone a pair of table rows a given number of times, input by the user. When I add the first number of rows everything seems alright, but when I do it again a second time it isn't just adding the number of rows input in the textbox, it's basically duplicating every existing row in the table, plus the number of rows given in said textbox. Here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle
[15:53:11] <shoky> Rejected: your fiddle link got cut off
[15:53:21] <rgr> during the call to .Dialog() shown in this snippet http://dpaste.com/1204290/ the click functions are called. This didnt happen on older jquery-ui versions. ANy ideas as to why?
[15:53:51] <Rejected> oops.. tks for the head's up shoky, here's the link: http://jsfiddle.net/Yt7dZ/
[15:55:35] <shoky> rgr: what do you mean, they're called?
[15:59:07] <rgr> exactly that. The click triggers are fired during the construction. before we return from the .Dialog() call the log() are firing. If I uncomment the other code it falls over since you cant now call a Dialog method until after its been properly initialised. This is new from the previous version of JQuery I am upgrading from.
[15:59:51] <shoky> rgr: seems fine  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fsW7e/
[16:01:38] <rgr> I appreciate your help. And it does . Which now has me really scratching my head.
[16:04:43] <shoky> Rejected: what's that :*  for in your selector?
[16:08:29] <trinode> Any idea why a slide out panel moved by calling append(newParent) isn't dismissable by clicking outside of it? it is dismissable on the first page, then the user goes to the second page and the menu is moved as described, and opens fine, just won't dismiss
[16:09:09] <trinode> I'm moving it by newParent.append(panel); not what I wrote before
[16:12:16] <Rejected> shoky supposedly to clone every tr with a class of 'newField'
[16:12:37] <shoky> Rejected: that's what tr.newField is there for. i asked about :*
[16:13:10] <trinode> OOOH I think it's related to this overlay: <div class="ui-panel-dismiss ui-panel-dismiss-position-left ui-panel-dismiss-display-push ui-panel-dismiss-open" data-panelid="menuPanelTemplate"></div>
[16:13:15] <shoky> Rejected:  anyways, if you say yourself that it selects every tr with class newField.. why are you surprised that all rows are getting cloned?
[16:14:10] <trinode> that div's not getting generated on the second page
[16:14:18] <trinode> how do I fully reinit the panel?
[16:14:19] <Rejected> I'm not surprised.. I just wanted to do it so it would only add as many rows as I input on the textbox, but haven't been able to do so
[16:14:48] <shoky> how about .. don't clone ALL the rows in the table?
[16:15:35] <shoky> Rejected:  here's one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Yt7dZ/2/
[16:15:56] <Rejected> let me check it out then shoky
[16:16:11] <Rejected> and thanks in advance anyway for taking the time :p
[16:17:12] <shoky> Rejected: np. and anyways, forget about :*  that's just wrong, afaik
[16:17:29] <Rejected> hum.. ok, will do.
[16:17:38] <shoky> (or show where you learned about it..)
[16:18:07] <Rejected> I'm really a newbie when it comes to jQuery, as you may have already noticed so.. I was just trying to get to it somehow
[16:18:28] <shoky> best not to make up syntax ;]
[16:19:04] <Rejected> asked on the jquery forums and got an answer, then I started trying to 'tweak' it but obviously failed :f
[16:25:31] <Guest58664> shoky http://pastie.org/7981738 changed $(list).find("a:not(:Contains(" + filter + "))").parent().slideUp(); to $(list).find("li:not([id*='" + filter + "'])").slideUp() and it works but changing           $(list).find("a:Contains(" + filter + ")").parent().slideDown();    to     $(list).find("li([id*='" + filter + "'])").slideDown(); doesnt
[16:25:50] <goddard> hey
[16:25:51] <goddard> http://jsfiddle.net/Goddard/qTvGM/
[16:26:41] <shoky> Guest58664: [id*=...]  is case-sensitive, i think. maybe that's it?
[16:27:10] <Guest58664> i set id to lower case
[16:27:15] <shoky> Guest58664: oh i see the prob..  remove the (  )  in the selector
[16:28:49] <hugo_moss> shoky: im trying to build a pixel perfect site thats responsive. i have a site that uses percentages, when i view it on any windows machine, everything is fine, its pixel perfect.  however, when i view it on an ios device like ipad or iphone, things aren't centered and it looks like the percentages are just off. could this have anything to do with the box model that safari uses?
[16:29:02] <Guest58664> $(list).find("li[id*='" + filter + "'])).slideDown() like this??
[16:29:25] <shoky> hugo_moss: i've never held an ios device for more than 5 min. i'm not your guy ;]
[16:30:12] <shoky> Guest58664:   $(list).find("li[id*='" + filter + "']").slideDown()
[16:30:32] <Guest58664> got it
[16:30:41] <Guest58664> thanks now its fully working

[16:50:24] <aquarian_1981> how can a trigger a callback only if a certain selector is present after the dom loads?
[16:52:17] <therealklanni> Does the .fail pipe not catch 404 errors on AJAX calls? I'm using getScript with a fail callback and it doesn't get called when I'm getting a 404

[17:06:48] <therealklanni> He is a tricky bastard
[17:27:57] <shoky> therealklanni: about the error callback in .ajax() docs:  Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests.
[17:29:27] <therealklanni> That explains it

[18:56:58] <chovy> doesn't seem to work.

[19:33:40] <shadykhan> can someone help me figure out why the var number is not increasing? http://jsfiddle.net/bKfbM/1/
[19:33:57] <shadykhan> function is built when near bottom of page it adds one to the variable
[19:36:23] <shoky> shadykhan: because you defined the variable inside the function. variables are local to the function they were defined in, in javascript
[19:38:02] <shadykhan> ahh thanks shoky im an idiot
[19:43:59] <shadykhan> shoky, one more question if you dont mind is this correct?  var url = "http://localhost/test/wp/api/page/" + pageNumber + "/?get=posts"; the number updates in console but not the url
[19:44:44] <shadykhan> shoky i got it had to move the var again thx
[19:52:05] <RohanBhangui> shadykhan: be very careful of local and global scopes....sometimes its better to have one over the other you must evaluate where each can be used
[20:01:15] <wilkinsmc> anyone use adwords?

[20:01:43] <wilkinsmc> cuz i can get on the side of the first page for .5

[20:07:28] <spillere> does anyone see anything wrong with this? http://jsfiddle.net/FYrak/ coz it works, but when i try using in my code it simply doesnt respond
[20:09:56] <shoky> spillere: $(document).ready() ?  errors in console?
[20:11:22] <spillere> should i put  $(document).ready()  in the code?
[20:12:13] <spillere> console doesnt show anything
[20:12:44] <shoky> spillere: yeah you should, unless your script is at the end of<body>
[20:13:21] <spillere> its on the head
[20:13:37] <shoky> then it needs $(document).ready()  yeah
[20:13:56] <thujone> you should probably use slideToggle() instead
[20:14:12] <thujone> and it doesn't seem like .delay() is doing anything
[20:14:33] <shoky> it's delaying the next animation
[20:14:34] <spillere> $("#searchDiv").slideToggle()?
[20:14:43] <thujone> what next animation?
[20:14:59] <spillere> i just wanna show and hide a div
[20:15:09] <shoky> the next animation caused by the thing causing the animations in that fiddle
[20:15:34] <thujone> i don't see any animation happening after .delay() in either line
[20:15:45] <shoky> click again
[20:16:35] <spillere> http://jsfiddle.net/FYrak/1/
[20:16:42] <spillere> but idk why when i put on my code it doenst work
[20:17:04] <shoky> spillere:  $(document).ready(function() { ... your code ... });
[20:17:15] <spillere> ahh
[20:21:09] <aaas> im trying to use simple ajax to replace html....the thing is that i have valid json which includes commands (not html structure) "command: insert, method: replacewidth, selector ....."   how can i use this COMMAND json to do this replacement
[20:22:52] <aaas> (this json is generated by drupal so im nto sure if this is non-standard jquery)
[20:23:59] <shoky> aaas: that doesn't look like it has anything to do with jquery. anyway.. you need to parse it, and do what it says...
[20:24:15] <shoky> if (data.command === 'insert') {  do some insertion ... }
[20:24:33] <aaas> shoky ah ok
[20:24:34] <aaas> thanks
[20:25:24] <shoky> unless those are actually jquery methods and selectors. but you'd need to elaborate on that or read more about how to use whatever it is you're using
[20:26:50] <aaas> shoky http://pastebin.com/5kyY3DUE   i admit i might be drupal dependent but for varous reasons I can't do this 'the drupal way', so I'm seeing if I can make use of json i already have
[20:28:03] <shoky> aaas: you could, maybe.. but you'd need to parse this object yourself and figure out yourself what you're supposed to do with it
[20:28:12] <spillere> shoky: this is the cold of my page http://pastebin.com/Cziacq9M
[20:28:28] <aaas> shoky ok ill look into it..that actually helps me thanks
[20:29:57] <spillere> shoky: http://cl.ly/image/1q410f1e3O26 this is the errors that the console give
[20:32:34] <shoky> spillere: you didn't do  $(document).ready(function() { ... your code ... });
[20:33:42] <spillere> crap, didnt use the funcion
[20:40:00] <spillere> shoky: managed to make it work, any idea why it 'jumps'on the end of the animatin? http://jsfiddle.net/FYrak/

[21:44:08] <optraz> hello people , i have an html of attribute id="foo-baz-10-1-0"  , what function or command from jquery i can use so that i can extract 10-1-0 from the attribute value?
[21:44:51] <kukabynd> $("element").attr(); ain't it?
[21:45:16] <b1lly> no
[21:45:25] <optraz> yes that is correct, but i dont want foo-baz-
[21:45:25] <b1lly> well
[21:45:26] <b1lly> ya
[21:45:35] <b1lly> then you need to do some work
[21:45:45] <Cork> $("element").attr('id').replace('foo-bar-');
[21:45:51] <Cork> opps
[21:45:54] <Cork> $("element").attr('id').replace('foo-bar-', '');
[21:46:02] <optraz> ohh function replace..
[21:46:03] <kukabynd> oh, thats nice
[21:47:11] <kukabynd> docs say
[21:47:11] <kukabynd> $("div").attr("id", function (arr) {
[21:47:12] <kukabynd>   return "div-id" + arr;
[21:47:13] <kukabynd> })
[21:47:44] <kukabynd> which is kind of obvious
[21:48:07] <optraz> ?
[21:48:08] <Cork> well that is the other direction
[21:48:48] <Cork> its for setting the id, not reading it
[22:03:57] <JohnnyCache> anyone knows good & simple tooltip plugin that supports "fixed" tooltip? (with no mouse over element, just fixed)
[22:05:11] <madprops> anybody here happens to know if the iframe samedomain restrictions are enforced at the browser level. And if it is, would it be 'legal' to make a browser without such restrictions?
[22:06:10] <Cork> madprops: the restriction is only at the client end
[22:06:43] <Cork> and sure you can make a browser without it, but it would be a browser that is extremely risky to use
[22:07:12] <Cork> as stealing users information from other pages would be really simple
[22:08:12] <relipse> i have a mac mini, and i changed my screen resolution to "scaled" and it disappeared, how do i get it back?

[22:46:19] <morfin> hello
[22:46:45] <morfin> can anyone suggest solution: i have lots of buttons using same function inside
[22:49:25] <morfin> how can i return false in sucess in $.ajax to prevent event
[22:49:32] <morfin> without rewriting everything
[22:50:26] <Cork> morfin: you can't
[22:50:40] <Cork> firstly use event.preventDefault() instead of return
[22:50:55] <Cork> and use dom_element.submit() to retrigger the sumbit event
[22:51:34] <Cork> morfin: ajax is async so you can't control the original event from is; cause it has already ended when the success callback is called
[22:58:13] <quuxman> how do I create an arbitrary event handler on an element?
[22:58:36] <Cork> arbitrary?
[22:58:43] <Cork> what do you mean?
[22:59:16] <quuxman> I want to say: $('#foo').on('custom_bar', special_function) // and then trigger that somewhere else, in a different thread
[22:59:27] <Cork> so do just that
[22:59:38] <quuxman> how do I trigger 'custom_bar'?
[22:59:43] <Cork> ?.trigger
[22:59:44] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[22:59:56] <quuxman> so jquery can really just swallow any event name?
[23:00:01] <Cork> yes
[23:00:10] <quuxman> wow, why have I never tried that before? Guess I've never needed it until now
[23:01:28] <quuxman> that's rad
[23:02:02] <joobie> guys.. how can i just move the word "the" in this example ? http://jsfiddle.net/aNDM5/
[23:02:20] <joobie> I want to ideally keep it as a <h1> as it is a heading, just a word within the heading is moving
[23:02:35] <Cork> joobie: position absolute
[23:03:01] <macmartine> joobie: yep, position it absolute
[23:03:03] <Cork> you need to add a placeholder to keep the space in the original message though
[23:03:14] <quuxman> I can even pass along args to the handler
[23:03:28] <Cork> also you most likely want inline-block instead of block
[23:06:06] <Cork> actually relative should fix it
[23:06:08] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/aNDM5/2/
[23:07:03] <Cork> joobie: http://jsfiddle.net/aNDM5/4/
[23:07:08] <morfin> oh i forgot
[23:07:52] <joobie> thanks cork
[23:18:42] <murosai_> what does (function($){)(jQuery); mean?
[23:20:07] <Rinthe> can someone help me with a problem with waypoints?
[23:21:57] <fabio_> hi everyone, I've got this problem concerning ajax & the mobile environment which I've been having headaches on, maybe someone can help... as difficult as describing it will be.
[23:22:21] <Rinthe> http://pastebin.com/qTRRrUvA when i scroll, it only triggers unsticky
[23:22:23] <Rinthe> never sticky
[23:22:25] <Rinthe> any ideas why?
[23:23:32] <Cork> murosai_: it's a scope that makes sure $ is jQuery
[23:23:43] <Cork> murosai_: it doesn't do anything else really
[23:24:23] <murosai_> i think it's an anonymous function that is executed immediately
[23:25:15] <fabio_> what are the reasons why a server would refuse an ajax request without any response at all (no X00 code either), and the xhr object says nothing but "error" with no description? p.s. it doesn't seem to be an cross-domain call
[23:26:46] <fabio_> the same call with the same parameters and the same jq version works on a competitor's site on the same common platform
[23:27:10] <Cork> fabio_: do you see any responses in the browsers network tab?
[23:27:25] <fabio_> I popped up chrome's dev tools
[23:28:00] <fabio_> no preview, no response data
[23:28:29] <fabio_> marked as a GET response with status (canceled) and type Pending
[23:28:32] <styol> Rinthe: when you console.log(direction); does it ever equal 'down'? it would seem not based on your description
[23:28:57] <Cork> fabio_: so either your code is calling .abort() or the server is closing the connection
[23:29:30] <fabio_> Cork: another thing worth mentioning is that, for some reason, even though I'm using a user string switcher (deving for mobile) it defaults to chrome string
[23:29:42] <Rinthe> styol: Im getting undefined
[23:29:42] <fabio_> while it doesn't for the other side making the same call
[23:29:51] <Rinthe> styol: can i pm you a URL?
[23:30:02] <styol> Rinthe: I'm not familiar with waypoint, but sure
[23:30:21] <lemonsparrow> is there a way to make this working piece of code more simple using jQuery ? http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/TQNhD/5/ thanks
[23:31:06] <fabio_> Cork: my code is dead simple, no .abort() anywhere. so it may be the server calling cause I'm not doing something it expects for ajax calls, perhaps?
[23:31:36] <Cork> lemonsparrow: i think i did that yesterday
[23:32:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I pinged u several times bro... telling it was giving me some error... but there was no response.. also ur code was js I suppose... I want jquery... js is pain in ass.. if u look at the fiddle now I have used jquery.. but I think using jquery I can remove the for loop.. thanks
[23:33:25] <Cork> so just ask here then
[23:33:36] <lemonsparrow> I just asked now :)
[23:33:50] <aaas> newbie question:  I see lots of jquery code that has something like function(event) or in my recent case function(ajax, response, status)....naively from other languages, you pass arguments to functions that you define elsewhere, but in these examples i never define ajax, or event...sorry for the basis question, but where do these things come from? the browser?
[23:33:52] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/TQNhD/5/
[23:34:45] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/TQNhD/6/
[23:35:24] <Cork> though as the content and the value is the same you can skip .attr('value', name)
[23:35:50] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/TQNhD/7/
[23:35:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok I shall modify it to my need.. thanks bro...:)
[23:36:20] <lemonsparrow> Cork: which one should I go with 6 or 7th version ?
[23:36:40] <Cork> if the display text and the option is the same 7
[23:36:44] <Cork> if they differ 6
[23:38:50] <fabio_> Cork: sorry to bother ^^ did you catch my latest message?
[23:38:54] <xertion> I'm having issues getting the .width and .height values of a dynamically generated image (It generates on droppable). I understand I have to wait for it to "load" before I can access those values, but I'm still not able to do it.
[23:39:24] <xertion> Basically, I create the img in the drop: function. However later when I want to change color of the img in a new function, I want to access width and height. and I can't...
[23:39:42] <xertion> (Only returns "0)
[23:40:00] <Cork> aaas: in javascript you can make inline function definitions, what you see there is just that
[23:40:42] <Cork> aaas: you define a function without a name function(event) and the function you call uses that function as a callback something like callback(the_event);
[23:40:43] <aaas> Cork thank you...but how does the javascript engine know what 'event' is if I never defined it...where do these arguments come from? some prototype?
[23:41:05] <Cork> aaas: the function you give the function to calls it with the arguments
[23:41:31] <Cork> ?eval var callback = function(event) { print(event); }; callback('123');
[23:41:34] <bot-t> Cork: "123"
[23:42:12] <aaas> Cork is there a name for this so i can look up more about it...the argument part...i think i get the inline functions
[23:42:13] <Cork> fabio_: donno, but yes if the client side isn't aborting the connection, the server side is
[23:42:26] <Cork> ?g javascript inline functions

[23:42:29] <bot-t> Cork, Javascript: Inline function vs predefined functions - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2539205/javascript-inline-function-vs-predefined-functions
[23:42:53] <Cork> hmm, not the best of examples
[23:43:04] <fabio_> Cork: if you have any tips or recommended tools on how to debug the issue (heck, I've even booted up a sniffer) I'll be happy to liste
[23:43:40] <Cork> fabio_: best place to start would be to debug the server code
[23:43:45] <fabio_> Cork: I just need to look at the issue from a different standpoint. thank you for helping me isolate the issue somewhat
[23:44:16] <Cork> xertion: is the image or a parent display: none; when you try to access the width?
[23:44:23] <noregret> is there any plugin for viewing source code ?
[23:44:44] <fabio_> Cork: eh, unfortunately I don't have access to that. see, my server side code goes through a login platform which is served by a big company, you register as a developer and get a sandbox. the issue is that the requests are NOT getting to my server at all, according to the access logs
[23:44:48] <styol> aaas: when you specified 'event' it defined it right there basically. Sort of a local variable definition within the function. When that function is called, each argument may not be defined, so if it is important that one is defined, of a certain type, and so forth, you would do checks likely at the top
[23:44:49] <xertion> Cork: sec I'm creating a pastebin with the relevant code, and no it's not display: none.
[23:45:44] <styol> aaas: you can put 'bananas' for event and the argument passed in that position will be set to 'bananas'
[23:45:44] <Cork> fabio_: can you get the request/response if you just use the url in the browsers url bar?
[23:45:46] <fabio_> Cork: so it's getting killed by the middleman server, and I have to take guesses. or try to contact them, I guess
[23:46:21] <Cork> fabio_: ya, if you can't make the connection or look at the service, you don't really have much opton
[23:46:22] <fabio_> Cork: by copy-pasting the ajax destination url in the browser's bar? yes, I do
[23:46:33] <fabio_> I am just ajaxifing an existing page
[23:46:41] <Cork> hmm
[23:46:53] <Cork> ok, that kinda rules out the server part
[23:46:58] <aaas> styol yes now THAT is how i understand how normal functions/arguments to work...but hte point is where aare these things coming from... so in the code http://pastebin.com/Y2dYdRmx   so say i call it 'bannanas'....what is the thing that defined it (whatever it is) so that i could call *it* bananas
[23:47:02] <Cork> unless it checks the requested-with header
[23:47:05] <napster> How to add an <img> tag to a <div> using jQuery Mobile?
[23:47:19] <napster> dynamically
[23:47:34] <aaas> styol it obviously knows it has a property 'state'
[23:47:38] <Cork> aaas: it's defined right there on line 1
[23:48:02] <aaas> Cork but i never gave it the property 'state'
[23:48:10] <Cork> function(event) is the same thing as function no_name(event)  {}
[23:48:28] <Cork> aaas: you named the data passed to the function
[23:48:37] <styol> aaas: var foo = function(callback){ callback('bananas'); } foo(function(bar){ console.log(bar); /* would be bananas */ });
[23:49:41] <Cork> function name(event) {} is similar to ex. C's void name(String event) {} for example
[23:49:51] <Cork> or most any other language
[23:50:05] <Cork> def name(event); end
[23:50:12] <Cork> func name(event) end
[23:50:14] <Cork> and so on
[23:50:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mithunsasidharan/Mshbg/ here, even if I submit the page with unchecked checkbox, the checkbox always remains checked...
[23:51:11] <aaas> well i understand the anoymous part...what im not really getting is the fact that event.state = TRUE, say int hat code...but i didnt define it as true
[23:51:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: pick a channel
[23:51:35] <lemonsparrow> Cork: jquery
[23:51:46] <fabio_> Cork: thanks for brainstorming with me. I'll try to delve deeper
[23:51:49] <xertion> Cork: See Pastebin here (Description on top describes how function is called in what order) http://pastebin.com/b8Cc3AXC
[23:52:18] <Cork> ?eval var callback = function(event) { print(event.state); }; callback({ state: 'active' }); @ aaas
[23:52:18] <bot-t> aaas: "active"
[23:52:35] <styol> aaas: but you're not calling window.onpopstate though yeah, something else is. So, they are in a way doing window.onpopstate({ state: true}); -- not a great example in this
[23:52:42] <Cork> aaas: the function is getting an object as the argument
[23:52:50] <aaas> ah ok
[23:52:58] <aaas> and this object comes from somewhere higher up?
[23:53:06] <aaas> i mean it's not in my code
[23:53:06] <Cork> from the browser ya
[23:53:10] <aaas> ah ok
[23:53:13] <Cork> your binding an event
[23:53:42] <Cork> window.addEventListener('popstate', function(event)  {});
[23:53:52] <aaas> and in the case of function (ajax, response, status)  then ajax must have been something that is from the browser (or ajax response)?
[23:53:55] <Cork> probably makes it a bit clearer
[23:54:03] <Cork> exactly
[23:54:14] <aaas> ok i think i understand it now
[23:54:16] <aaas> thanks
[23:54:31] <styol> you can name ajax, response, status whatever you want and within that function, it will be the expected values. Like a, r, s as an example
[23:54:41] <lemonsparrow> Cork: any idea.. what i am missing ?
[23:55:20] <noregret> is there any plugin for viewing source code (wiith highliting and other stuff)?
[23:55:24] <Cork> xertion: the code doesn't really tell what's needed, check what css is applied on the element and it's parents when it fails
[23:55:39] <aaas> styol yes that part i *completely* undertand..the part i was having problem with is that they ahv to be *something* for me to give whatever name to... so in the code  https://code.google.com/p/d7ux/source/browse/trunk/misc/ajax.js?r=220#293   im looking all over for where they define 'ajax' or 'response'
[23:56:02] <aaas> but if it's something higher up the chain
[23:56:05] <aaas> that im just not seeing
[23:56:10] <aaas> that makes sense
[23:56:16] <aaas> still would like to see wehre
[23:56:16] <Cork> lemonsparrow: please move into the 21'th sentry and let the event attributes die
[23:56:20] <aaas> but ill keep looking
[23:56:23] <xertion> Cork: <img> has style="width: 189px; height: 189px" when it fails.
[23:56:58] <lemonsparrow> Cork: :) my client wants it thisway... for the rest its unobtrusive js :)
[23:57:22] <Cork> lemonsparrow: also your code is broken
[23:58:26] <Cork> lemonsparrow: btw what server language is this?
[23:58:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: java
[23:58:52] <styol> aaas: ah gotcha, yeah, so something is basically doing -- Drupal.aax.commands.insert('ajax', 'response', 'status');
[23:59:02] <styol> *Drupal.ajax...
[23:59:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: http://jsfiddle.net/Mshbg/1/
[23:59:28] <Cork> opps missed the ? : ""
[23:59:39] <styol> aaas: err that isn't necessarily true because its prototype, but there should be a '.insert' somewhere :)
[23:59:45] <lemonsparrow> Cork: my need is simple.. if I check it it should be set as true and if unchecked false.. after saving also.. it should display properly.. do I need that stupid js there to make it work ?
[23:59:55] <Cork> lemonsparrow: basically there is no need for the javascript at all
