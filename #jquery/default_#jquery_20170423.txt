[00:24:51] <Me1of1> Hey there! I need some advice :) Im using JQ for adding some icons to my navigation but I feel like this is the the most optimal/efficient way of adding these icons, perhaps there is a better approach https://codepen.io/MarkCodeFu/pen/WjxywZ?editors=1100 ? thanks :)
[01:08:22] <WhirledPress> css, most likely. I'll look
[01:10:33] <WhirledPress> Me1of1, if you assign classes in your html to the elements, you can use :before to append the icons in your css and it will be much more efficient.
[01:12:38] <Me1of1> WhirledPress, that's the thing... that <li>s are generated by a compiler I don't have access to each one individually that's why I cant assign class to each one like that and then do my appending stuff :-/
[01:13:50] <WhirledPress> will they always be in the same order?
[01:14:17] <WhirledPress> because you could use nth-child designators with :before to append them
[01:16:01] <Me1of1> WhirledPress, yeah that's a good idea too hmmm maybe then I should do that? it may sometime down the road change the order but it's not a big deal even if so, to edit the css to get it back on track with at that time of current order should take less than 5 min
[01:16:25] <Me1of1> it's the WordPress you know... it uses a function to create the navigation and you can only access it once its generated :-/
[01:16:55] <WhirledPress> actually, with WordPress, there are filter and action hooks you can use for navigation modification
[01:18:37] <Me1of1> hmm I didn't know that o.O would you mind letting me know some of these hooks & filters that would help for this scenario? I havent used many hooks and filters at all thus i know only handful of them
[01:19:22] <WhirledPress> I would grab a "menu icons" plugin and look how they do it. Gimme a second and I'll check. A good place to ask, though, is #wordpress. It's an active channel.
[01:20:53] <Me1of1> aha I use that channel frequently for my WP question, you're right, that's a great advice, let me log in there and just in case ask them too see if they've any good advice on this matter :)

[13:51:18] * hellyeah i am rusty
[18:02:21] <WhirledPress> did jquery die overnight or what?
[18:45:40] <skinux> I don't really like ReactJS, is there a plugin for jQuery that allows virtual DOM?
