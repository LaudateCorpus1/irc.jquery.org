[00:04:04] <dimi1947> Hi I have problem the dialog element of jquery UI
[00:04:28] <dimi1947> and the buttons that go with it
[00:07:07] <dimi1947> and the functions that maybe attached to these buttons
[00:07:57] <dimi1947> I cannot pass arguments to them...If I do the botton disappears
[00:08:07] <dimi1947> the button I mean
[00:08:12] <Cork> ?paste @ dimi1947
[00:08:12] <b-ot> dimi1947: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:09:10] <dimi1947> http://jsbin.com/silajo/69/ it is backbone code....
[00:09:34] <dimi1947> go at line 90
[00:10:03] <Cork> could you please use jsfiddle
[00:10:06] <Cork> jsbin is junk
[00:10:13] <dimi1947> ok wait
[00:12:51] <dimi1947> http://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/4srb6k95/ go at line 90
[00:13:35] <dimi1947> I create an OK button and associate it with this.save
[00:14:01] <Cork> yout giving save as a reference
[00:14:13] <Cork> so it will lost connection to the object (this)
[00:14:13] <dimi1947> the function at line 110
[00:14:35] <Cork> what you want to do is either .bind the function to this
[00:14:59] <Cork> var self = this; "ok": function() { self.save() }
[00:15:11] <dimi1947> first of all did you read above what my porblem is...that I cannot pass an argument
[00:15:34] <Cork> uh
[00:15:46] <Cork> var self = this; "ok": function() { self.save('arguments', 'works', 'fine') }
[00:16:04] <Cork> you can't do "ok": self.save('arguments')
[00:16:14] <Cork> as that will execute the save function
[00:16:18] <Cork> not pass it as a reference
[00:16:28] <dimi1947> then...how I must do it?
[00:16:51] <dimi1947> If I pass arguments the button is gone from the dialog box
[00:16:56] <Cork> i just showed you
[00:17:04] <Cork> use .bind or an anonymous function wrapper
[00:17:43] <dimi1947> just a min...I am not so experienced in bb and I am having trouble following you
[00:18:02] <Cork> this isn't backbone
[00:18:06] <Cork> this is plain js
[00:18:18] <Cork> func() executes the function
[00:18:30] <Cork> so var a = func(); means execute func and set the return value to a
[00:18:41] <Cork> var a = func; sets the reference to the function to a
[00:18:49] <Cork> meaning you can later do a() to run func
[00:19:07] <Cork> so if you want to include arguments to func, that should always be executed
[00:19:17] <dimi1947> you are quick
[00:19:22] <dimi1947> yes...
[00:19:22] <Cork> you need to do var a = func.bind(this, 'a');
[00:19:34] <Cork> or var a = function() { func(a); }
[00:19:40] <Cork> opps
[00:19:45] <Cork> or var a = function() { func('a'); }
[00:20:42] <dimi1947> var buttons = this.save.binf('test');
[00:21:01] <Cork> that would set this == 'test' inside save
[00:21:25] <Cork> you want this.save.bind(this, 'test')
[00:21:35] <Cork> dimi1947: note .bind isn't supported in older browsers
[00:21:42] <Cork> so make sure you're ok with the limitations
[00:22:36] <dimi1947> var buttons=this.save.bind(this, 'test')
[00:22:57] <Cork> think over what you just typed
[00:23:31] <dimi1947> I am trying....I am not familiar with bind keyword
[00:23:37] <Cork> ?mdn bind
[00:23:37] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.bind() - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[00:24:23] <dimi1947> the first this refers to the bb object...the second this,what is its use?
[00:24:44] <Cork> dimi1947: read what i've explained before
[00:24:48] <dimi1947> ok
[00:24:49] <Cork> i've already answered this
[00:25:54] <Mark_2> how do i make this kind of board only using jquery?  http://desimer.com/experiment/red/  where do i have to start? (how do i make the board contents layer come down from the top when i click on the title?)
[00:30:04] <Xatenev> Heya
[00:30:19] <Xatenev> is there something like onFirstClick instead of onClick? I need to perform a JS function the very first time an element is clicked
[00:31:07] <Cork> ?api once
[00:31:08] <b-ot> Cork: No matches.
[00:31:11] <Cork> ?api one
[00:31:13] <b-ot> Cork: .one(): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[00:34:47] <prohobo> uh
[00:34:58] <prohobo> why is it so freaking hard to find a range slider script that works?
[00:35:24] <Cork> prohobo: what's wrong with jquery-ui slider?
[00:35:40] <prohobo> can't drag the entire range selection by the middle
[00:35:45] <prohobo> essentially making it useless
[00:35:45] <Cork> ah
[00:35:59] <Cork> well there are sliders out there that dose it out of the box
[00:36:06] <prohobo> yep
[00:36:06] <Cork> or you could just extend the ui slider
[00:36:16] <prohobo> they're all horrible
[00:36:47] <Cork> uh
[00:36:58] <Cork> like i said ui slider has always been solid for me
[00:37:03] <prohobo> the styling is so confused that if you try to use them with bootstrap they become little piles of failure
[00:37:08] <Cork> easy to extend if the basic features of it isn't enough for you
[00:37:29] <Cork> prohobo: the styling shouldn't ever depend on the widget
[00:37:36] <Cork> just style it to look like you want
[00:37:48] <prohobo> thats what im saying :\
[00:38:11] <prohobo> i could try to extend the jquery ui slider
[00:38:19] <Cork> sounds like "blaming the tools" to me...
[00:38:19] <Mark_2> how do i make this animation only using jquery anyone? http://desimer.com/experiment/red/
[00:38:37] <Xatenev> Cork: cool lol
[00:38:43] <prohobo> no way man, the tools only work in very specific environments
[00:38:44] <Xatenev> didnt know it was that simple
[00:39:05] <Xatenev> I would really like to see the plain JS code behind .one()
[00:39:07] <Xatenev> lo
[00:39:47] <Cork> Xatenev: function() { this.removeEventListner(func); callback(); }
[00:40:21] <Xatenev> what is the callback() needed for?
[00:40:31] <Uhkis> to actually do the callback..
[00:40:31] <Xatenev> do you need a callback there?^^
[00:40:35] <Cork> its the function you pass to one
[00:40:58] <Cork> func is the function wrapper used to unbind the event listener
[00:41:04] <Xatenev> ay
[00:41:10] <Cork> (the one that calls your callback function)
[00:43:24] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[00:43:24] <negusnegesti> Is it possible to include a php-file at the beginning and later on to reload that php-file via ajax with new parameters/values?
[00:43:44] <Cork> negusnegesti: you can't include php in js; period
[00:43:51] <Cork> php runs server side
[00:44:02] <Cork> the result of the php code is what is sent to the client
[00:44:16] <negusnegesti> Cork: the file was included via php
[00:44:26] <Cork> in php ya
[00:44:38] <Cork> but like i said php isn't ever transmitted over the wire
[00:44:45] <Cork> you can't do anything with it client side
[00:45:06] <Cork> only way is to make a network call back to an url and have another php resource send the new content
[00:45:21] <Uhkis> sounds like a pretty simple ajax get to me
[00:45:26] <Cork> ya
[00:46:32] <negusnegesti> Cork: so, the only chance is to call a php-file and obtain those values in order to work with them, right?
[00:46:52] <Cork> negusnegesti: php can return a partial html section
[00:46:53] <Cork> or json
[00:46:55] <Cork> or xml
[00:47:05] <Cork> or what ever other data type you feel you want to use
[00:47:14] <Cork> you can't send variables though
[00:47:28] <Cork> as like i said, php isn't transfered, the text it generates is
[00:47:49] <negusnegesti> anything using echo
[00:48:03] <Uhkis> sending variables would be the get parameters
[00:48:14] <negusnegesti> yes
[00:48:16] <Omar-> good morning
[00:48:40] <Uhkis> good day
[00:48:53] <negusnegesti> ok thx guys
[00:50:58] <prohobo> Cork, i don't understand this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/331
[00:51:07] <prohobo> rangeDrag was added to jquery-ui in 2011
[00:51:15] <prohobo> why is it not documented :\
[00:51:35] <Cork> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/47e5ec94e7d771a52dfb28896fe05b9f4de2dce4
[00:51:51] <Cork> prohobo: so the doc is out of date...
[00:51:58] <Cork> jus set reangeDrag: true
[00:52:01] <Cork> *just
[00:52:42] <Cork> (file a bug about the option missing)
[00:52:56] <Xatenev> wheey .one works great
[00:52:56] <Xatenev> :p
[00:53:11] <Xatenev> thanks for the quick help
[00:57:50] <prohobo> okay
[00:57:56] <prohobo> turns out the rangeDrag commit is a lie
[01:00:05] <Xatenev> Another quick question ^_^
[01:00:05] <prohobo> was removed at some point
[01:00:18] <Xatenev> whats the easiest way to extract all numbers from a string?
[01:00:24] <Xatenev> for example I got the input string www-123578
[01:00:27] <Xatenev> could also be www-123
[01:00:35] <Xatenev> and now I want all numbers (123 in this case)
[01:00:45] <Cork> prohobo: actually, the issue is closed, but i don't see that it was actually ever pulled
[01:01:07] <Uhkis> string.match('[0-9]+');
[01:01:08] <Xatenev> tried parsing but didnt work :[
[01:01:10] <Omar-> Xatenev string.split("-")[0]
[01:01:13] <Omar-> Xatenev string.split("-")[1]
[01:01:15] <Omar-> sorry
[01:01:30] <Xatenev> hm whats the better solution in my case? using regex like Uhkis said
[01:01:32] <Xatenev> or just using string.split?
[01:01:36] <Cork> multi match is a bit of a pain in js
[01:01:50] <Cork> but if the numbers is always at the end just split('-')
[01:01:54] <Xatenev> ayay
[01:02:56] * Xatenev trying
[01:04:50] <Xatenev> wheey
[01:04:54] <Xatenev> it works super great *HAPPY*
[01:04:54] <Xatenev> ^^
[01:06:59] <Uhkis> someone's having a good day :-)
[01:15:21] <Xatenev> Heya, I will ask here, tho I already asked in JS channel - we got a back to list button
[01:15:39] <Xatenev> which at the moment owrks by using javascript.history.go(-1)
[01:15:53] <Xatenev> Problem: you have to press the button "Try again" once, because it does not find the post data inside the cache
[01:16:13] <Cork> Xatenev: browsers won't ever to post calls without warning
[01:16:19] <Xatenev> okay
[01:16:24] <Xatenev> so How do other websites implement such a back to list?
[01:16:25] <Cork> its a safty messure to prevent double posting
[01:16:33] <Xatenev> yea I get that
[01:16:42] <Cork> normally they use get calls or redirect to a get call after the post
[01:17:05] <Xatenev> hm
[01:18:31] <Xatenev> I will try if I can re-built the extension using GET instead of post
[01:18:37] <Xatenev> thanks :]
[01:19:02] <Xatenev> actually I love the jquery channel, fastest IRC help channel seen yet lold
[01:19:41] <Uhkis> just make sure Cork is online :D
[01:20:11] <Xatenev> i know right
[01:20:11] <Xatenev> :D
[01:20:29] <Xatenev> cork is like a helping angel
[01:20:29] <Xatenev> :D
[01:26:17] <newer>  I have got a template with different tabs and some html tables inside (datatables), when I change the tab, the headers have with:0px until I click in one of that headers, and then they get the with they are suppose to get to be in the 100% of the page, any idea whats going on or how to solve it?
[01:26:57] <newer> I have tried doinng <thead style="width: 100%;"> , but doesnt solve the problem
[01:28:24] <Xatenev> I hope I am allowed to ask another question ^_^ thanks for the get call hint btw
[01:28:39] <Xatenev> Is it possible to preventDefault() when I click an <a> tag
[01:28:46] <Xatenev> do something, and then continue default action
[01:29:31] <Cork> no
[01:29:48] <Xatenev> hm
[01:30:01] <Xatenev> thats mean :p
[01:30:14] <Cork> heh
[01:33:21] <Uhkis> Xatenev: well you could do preventDefault() and after doing your stuff window.location = $(this).attr('href');
[01:33:52] <Cork> eeh...
[01:34:06] <Cork> that would kill support for ctrl+click or middle click though
[01:34:17] <Cork> (and i HATE sites that does that)
[01:34:32] <Cork> it's much better to conditionally call preventDefault
[01:34:44] <Cork> and if you have to do something async... you shouldn't
[01:35:38] <Uhkis> right, it's super annoying to middle click something just to see javascript:blah() on the address bar of a blank page
[01:35:58] <Cork> or middle click, just to get the current page replaced
[01:36:51] <Uhkis> i can't recall seeing that anywhere
[01:37:04] <Cork> i have
[01:37:18] <Xatenev> I know some pages doing that
[01:37:20] <Xatenev> @Uhkis^^
[01:37:21] <Cork> though i usually use ctrl+click not middle
[01:37:32] <Cork> clicking the scroll weel is kina wonky
[01:37:45] <Xatenev> wonky? :D
[01:37:51] <Uhkis> get a better mouse ;)
[01:37:55] <Xatenev> +7
[01:37:55] <Xatenev> xD
[01:41:03] <Xatenev> Mhm i would really like to build something using full JS :O^^
[01:41:34] <Cork> full js?
[01:42:02] <Xatenev> Well like a JS based browsergame f.e.
[01:42:31] <Xatenev> nodeJS BE or something like that^^
[01:42:53] <Cork> so you mean completely in not "full"
[01:43:14] <Xatenev> Cork: probably I do :)
[01:44:29] <Xatenev> I rly like this game : www.clickerheroes.com
[01:44:44] <Xatenev> I think its full JS aswlel^^ not sure though
[01:45:30] <xec> it's a flash game...
[01:45:31] <Uhkis> far from it
[01:45:40] <Xatenev> oh, is it? :p
[01:45:52] <Xatenev> Ive just started it once, thought its JS :D
[01:46:00] <Xatenev> but didnt look it up, k den^^
[01:46:00] <Uhkis> Xatenev: right click is magic
[01:46:16] <Xatenev> Uhkis: didnt get that :P
[01:54:30] <gtristan> What is a quick way to find out if an element is inside another element ?
[01:54:54] <Cork> gtristan: .has
[01:55:02] <Cork> ?api has
[01:55:02] <b-ot> Cork: .has(): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[01:55:07] <Cork> hmm no
[01:55:48] <xec> you could do $(el).parents('someselector').length
[01:55:49] <gtristan> closest() ?
[01:55:57] <Cork> not for contains no
[01:56:04] <Cork> .find(elm).length > 0
[01:56:23] <xec> would find out if element is inside someselector, but sure. closest or find can do the job too
[01:56:28] <Cork> uh, or i read your question backwards
[01:56:37] <gtristan> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1059459/best-way-to-find-out-if-element-is-a-descendant-of-another shows that
[01:56:39] <Cork> xec: closest does the job
[01:57:04] <Cork> gtristan: .closest(elm).length > 0 or find(elm).length
[01:57:10] <Cork> depending on direction
[01:57:10] <steelbrain> Ummm, guys I have something interesting for ya. jsperf.com/dquery-vs-jquery-inserting-dom-elements
[01:57:19] <gtristan> Cork, thanks
[01:57:28] <xec> gtristan: do you have the elements as DOM elements or jquery objects or just their id as string or what?
[01:57:37] <gtristan> I'll go with one of another, I didnt realize you could pass an element to find
[01:57:45] <Cork> both should work
[01:57:48] <gtristan> xec, elements
[01:58:33] * gtristan goes with find, reads better
[01:59:12] <Uhkis> steelbrain: the error was interesting or what
[01:59:30] <xec> gtristan: .closest() is probably the most efficient
[01:59:40] <steelbrain> Uhkis: There's an error, let me see :P and it wasn't interesting, the interesting part was performance
[02:00:08] <gtristan> xec, eek, you are totally right, of course walking up the tree is faster than searching descendants
[02:00:22] <Uhkis> steelbrain: $ is not a function. on that dQuery part
[02:00:38] <steelbrain> I know, the file I linked to doesn't exist, 404, re-adding it now
[02:04:23] <gtristan> hmmm, ok this is a sensitive question... it's damn hard to get it right... I'm writing a function which scrolls an overflow-y:scroll element to a position which reveals another element, which may be in the overflow
[02:04:47] <gtristan> I'm thinking of using the .offset() of the scrollable and comparing to the .offset() of the given child element
[02:05:12] <gtristan> and adjusting the child element's reported document relative position with the given scrollable element's scrollTop()
[02:05:50] <gtristan> is that the right way to go ? Or should I try using the child element's .position() and pray to god that it accounts for the overflow ?
[02:06:55] <gtristan> until now I've been only 'scrolling to end' and using the scrollable element's direct child .scrollHeight (i.e. scrollHeight the DOM element property)
[02:07:08] <gtristan> which has been more reliable than anything else so far
[02:07:19] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Sorry, I passed out :/
[02:07:27] <ThKo> Omar-: Hi how are you? ;)
[02:08:07] <steelbrain> Uhkis: Fixed
[02:11:16] <delboy1978uk> i have a url which i was previously tagging ?var=value onto the end. But now some of the urls already have var=something in the query string. how do i replace the value if it already exists?
[02:11:27] <delboy1978uk> i was doing this:
[02:11:33] <delboy1978uk> var url = orgid ? window.location.href + '?orgid=' + orgid  : window.location.href ;
[02:12:23] <Cork> delboy1978uk: window.location.search
[02:12:58] <Cork> and window.location.path
[02:13:08] <delboy1978uk> ah some plain JS? Thanks Cork
[02:13:14] * delboy1978uk googles
[02:14:05] <Meir`> gtristan, can you please set some fiddle?
[02:14:06] <Omar-> hi CreativeWolf ThKo :)
[02:14:38] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: It worked using a different method, creating a Plunk right now :)
[02:14:41] <gtristan> Meir`, eh... it's a lot of work, I'll end up doing that if I hit a brick wall though
[02:15:08] <gtristan> looks like I have some code which does the drag and drop sorting bit which relies on .position() being correct
[02:15:12] <Meir`> what about a short demonstraing exmaple?
[02:15:15] <gtristan> so, maybe it will work
[02:15:27] <Omar-> CreativeWolf there are many ways to do so, but remember that the second time you click back button, the script wont work
[02:15:40] <Meir`> wait, drag and drop?
[02:15:46] <Omar-> unless you pushState() to add entry yo history stack
[02:16:03] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Yes, something like that happened...
[02:16:10] <gtristan> Meir`, this is not for drag and drop... but I have some code which does that and autoscrolls and detects the correct index for the placeholder, using .position()
[02:16:26] <Meir`> ok
[02:16:30] <gtristan> Meir`, http://jsfiddle.net/4yxL27ya/ <-- this is the last time that I only had to reveal the 'last' item
[02:16:42] <Meir`> anyway, you should use element top
[02:16:54] <gtristan> what is element top ?
[02:17:11] <gtristan> sounds ambiguous :-S
[02:17:17] <gtristan> there is offset top, position top
[02:17:51] <Omar-> CreativeWolf unfortunately altering toPage doesn't update history
[02:18:06] <Omar-> so I dont know if replaceState() would fix it
[02:18:16] <gtristan> Meir`, actually that fiddle is not what I settled on, it *depends* on the DOM having declared overflow:hidden on the nested child
[02:18:33] <gtristan> Meir`, while using .scrollHeight works in a perfectly DOM agnostic way
[02:19:44] <Meir`> gtristan, well, i suggest you start with unique id to every element
[02:20:01] <Meir`> so you can easily select the one you wish to scroll to
[02:20:15] <Uhkis> steelbrain: interesting indeed, jquery has the same speed while NOT killing the browser :D
[02:20:32] <gtristan> Meir`, you mean if I wanted to port this whole thing to a fiddle ? eh
[02:20:41] <gtristan> I deal in elements, not selectors
[02:20:44] <gtristan> honestly
[02:21:53] <gtristan> when OtScrollable.revealElement (element, animationDuration, afterCallback) is called, I do have the element, anyhow
[02:22:19] <gtristan> (the scrollable object knows/owns the scrollable element)
[02:25:15] <Meir`> gtristan, i assumed it's part of your original file
[02:25:33] <Meir`> be right back, then i'll play with your fiddle
[02:25:33] <Omar-> gtristan regarding scrolling http://jsfiddle.net/4yxL27ya/1/
[02:27:02] <Omar-> forget it, it's wrong
[02:27:22] <steelbrain> Uhkis: dQuery is still a baby project and I could use some suggestions, define killing the browser :P
[02:27:48] <steelbrain> Uhkis: dQuery is about 10kb uncompressed
[02:27:58] <Uhkis> steelbrain: while dQuery test was running, ff35 on linux totally froze, couldn't scroll or change tabs etc
[02:29:03] <steelbrain> Uhkis: That's odd, are you sure you're not running on power saver mode :D and by the way, it uses native apis everywhere, nothing by itself so I am quite not sure how did it make the browser unresponsive.
[02:29:40] <gtristan> Omar-, heh
[02:30:10] <gtristan> Omar-, I added a #target element: http://jsfiddle.net/zpv5ehyh/
[02:30:44] <gtristan> and tried with outerHeight(true)... I'll try to figure it out in that fiddle...
[02:32:52] <Omar-> gtristan it should scroll 383 pixels
[02:33:15] <Omar-> i almost got it. just struggling with 5 extra pixels
[02:33:18] <gtristan> well, there is two ways, one which aligns the revealed item at the bottom, one at the top
[02:33:49] <Meir`> gtristan, http://jsfiddle.net/4yxL27ya/7/
[02:33:51] <gtristan> I will eventually try to accomplish it basically by 'scrolling least as possible'
[02:34:09] <Meir`> i added if="try" to one of the "Hello World" div
[02:34:14] <Meir`> id="try" *
[02:34:45] <gtristan> Meir`, you missed it: http://jsfiddle.net/4yxL27ya/8/
[02:34:54] <gtristan> Meir`, I added 'This One !' in the header
[02:34:55] <gtristan> hehe
[02:35:47] <Meir`> same manner :)
[02:36:13] <Meir`> you can first store the select element in some var
[02:36:25] <Meir`> and then scroll a little bit more, by adding its height
[02:37:05] <Omar-> gtristan http://jsfiddle.net/4yxL27ya/9/
[02:37:36] <Meir`> Hi Omar- ;)
[02:37:53] <Meir`> He wasn't really meaning to the last child
[02:38:11] <Meir`> he provided some ready fiddle
[02:38:16] <Omar-> hi Meir` how are you? :)
[02:38:24] <Omar-> oh ok
[02:38:28] <Meir`> i'm good, thanks!
[02:38:31] <gtristan> yeah... and that one is also off by a few pixels here :)
[02:38:39] <gtristan> fun problem though :)
[02:38:41] <gtristan> haha
[02:38:57] <gtristan> I'm still trying fiddles, dont think I've given up or anything ;-)
[02:38:59] <Meir`> gtristan show me your current attempt
[02:39:19] <gtristan> Meir`, http://jsfiddle.net/zpv5ehyh/8/
[02:39:38] <gtristan> there is one with different text, it's showing at the top
[02:39:48] <gtristan> totally not my intention, have to give it a bit more though
[02:39:50] <gtristan> *thought
[02:40:36] <gtristan> honestly setting the scrollTop to the child position *should* work in theory :-S
[02:40:43] <gtristan> maybe I have to work with page offsets
[02:44:04] <gtristan> Meir`, http://jsfiddle.net/zpv5ehyh/11/ <-- that aligns it with the top
[02:44:17] <gtristan> however it still misses the margin
[02:45:41] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: http://plnkr.co/edit/et6ULl6Y0HHGv5il95Wi - This works in the Emulator but as you said, once. I'd like it to close the app if it reached the success page after logged in. Working on it...
[02:49:35] <gtristan> damn
[02:49:43] <gtristan> How do I get the computed margin-top ?
[02:49:57] <gtristan> $(element).css ('margin-top') doesnt seem to do it
[02:51:40] <Meir`> gtristan, i think i got confused
[02:52:12] <Meir`> you need to scroll to the wrapping div? i.e. "The target" ?
[02:52:15] <gtristan> hmm ? yeah the one I posted... works by using page offsets and comparing the scrollable and child offsets
[02:52:32] <gtristan> yeah, I want to reveal a given element
[02:52:41] <Omar-> CreativeWolf are you using cordova?
[02:52:46] <Meir`> ok. so for me it scrolls exactly to this one
[02:52:50] <gtristan> it almost works for aligning the top, aligning the bottom should be just as easy
[02:53:14] <Meir`> you want it to be in the bottom of the scrolling?
[02:53:24] <gtristan> Meir`, well, yeah.. except its not 'nice', because it doesnt scroll to the target - target's top margin
[02:53:37] <gtristan> I want the option to do both yeah, the bottom will be easy
[02:53:46] <gtristan> by calculating the item height, sure
[02:54:11] <gtristan> I.e. this one is nice: http://jsfiddle.net/ng32bf55/
[02:54:15] <gtristan> and aligns to the top
[02:54:22] <gtristan> but it has a hard coded -4 ;-)
[02:54:27] <gtristan> which happens to be it's top margin
[02:55:17] <gtristan> what I need is instead of $('#target').offset(), I need to use $('target').outerOffset (true)
[02:55:28] <gtristan> except that there is no such thing as outerOffset() afaict
[02:55:45] <gtristan> while outerWidth (true) 'is a thing'
[02:57:38] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Yes
[02:58:40] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: Is there a online emulator for Cordova?
[02:59:23] <Meir`> gtristan, http://jsfiddle.net/zpv5ehyh/17/
[02:59:58] <gtristan> ah it seems to work now hah, I must have done something wrong last time
[03:00:07] <Meir`> is that what you meant? the little gap above the div?
[03:00:45] <gtristan> Ah !
[03:00:48] <gtristan> silly me
[03:00:59] <gtristan> marginTop, not margin-top
[03:01:07] <gtristan> and parseInt !
[03:01:14] <gtristan> of course, that's what I was missing, parseInt !
[03:01:16] <Meir`> it's still strange that you needed to manipulate offset and scrolltop togetehrt
[03:01:17] <gtristan> hahaha
[03:01:22] <Meir`> together*
[03:01:27] <Omar-> CreativeWolf I really dont know. never came near cordova :D
[03:01:28] <gtristan> I was putting it through console.log and seeing the right margin
[03:01:50] <gtristan> Meir`, scrollTop is only because the scrollable div could start anywhere
[03:02:15] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: :]
[03:02:17] <gtristan> let's try it in a timeout... and see if that part works
[03:02:28] <Meir`> .position().top should return the element top relative to its parent
[03:03:09] <Meir`> so scrolling to $("#target").position().top minus the margin should've be enough
[03:03:28] <Meir`> i hate when these things require messings
[03:04:27] <Omar-> CreativeWolf but i know that cordova has a special function to exit app
[03:04:34] <gtristan> Meir`, yeah scrollTop was supposed to be subtracted: http://jsfiddle.net/zux80qvL/
[03:04:37] <Omar-> are you using that?
[03:04:49] <gtristan> Meir`, if you try moving the scrollbar in the first 3 seconds, it will scroll to the right position
[03:04:56] <CreativeWolf> Omar-: I doubt. Need to check on that...
[03:05:03] <gtristan> indeed, I wish that .position() worked properly
[03:05:30] <gtristan> Maybe I should give that another try
[03:05:44] <Meir`> maybe :) i hope you catched the thing
[03:06:15] <workerbe1two> Hi.  $('.myclass').css(  )   changes the css style, but is not adding a style attribute, right?
[03:06:58] <Meir`> workerbe1two why can't you track that by yourself?
[03:07:07] <Meir`> with developer tools or firebug
[03:07:07] <gtristan> Meir`, nope: http://jsfiddle.net/zux80qvL/2/ hehe
[03:07:20] <gtristan> really got to do the offset() / compare route
[03:07:37] <gtristan> anyway, I should be able to port this in and do something more exotic and flexible now
[03:08:10] <xec> workerbe1two: .css() writes to the style property, as if there was a style attribute there
[03:08:16] <gtristan> support bottom align, and some heuristics to decide whether to align top, or bottom (defaulting to the top of the child element is taller than the viewport)
[03:08:43] <gtristan> s/of/if
[03:13:20] <Meir`> gtristan good luck
[03:13:37] <gtristan> Meir`, eh, thanks for playing the game, it helped :)
[03:13:49] <gtristan> I've been through this grinder before, I'll make it out :)
[03:16:55] <gtristan> Meir`, here: http://jsfiddle.net/7hLfme1b/
[03:17:16] <gtristan> playing with the scrollbar, no matter the position, it keeps working :)
[03:17:28] <gtristan> just the heuristics remain, I'll do that part just in code
[03:28:21] <Meir`> gtristan, just a little tip: users sometimes hate when the site controlls their scrolling
[03:28:27] <Meir`> controls*
[03:28:55] <Meir`> use it only for sections that doesn't have user interaction
[03:29:11] <Meir`> like a modern "marquee"
[03:33:33] <gtristan> Meir`, its a crud tool, I just use it when the user adds a new item to a sorted list basically
[03:49:50] <drag0nius> how can i make jquery object from 2 separate nodes?
[03:50:22] <drag0nius> like var $n1 = $('id1'), $n2 = $('id2'); $(???).click(...);
[03:56:10] <Meir`> drag0nius, you can select multiple
[03:56:33] <Meir`> $('id1', 'id2').click(...);
[03:57:13] <Meir`> sorry: $('id1, id2').click(...);
[03:57:39] <Meir`> and anyway, if it's ids, so it should be: $('#id1, #id2').click(...);
[03:59:38] <xec> drag0nius: you can do $n1.add($n2).click(...)
[04:00:01] <TuomasL> From where can come to using classes in html structure as well, for simplicity. Elements with similar purposes.
[04:00:36] <xec> TuomasL: is that a question?
[04:00:55] <TuomasL> No, sorry for the semi-OT remark.
[04:01:02] <TuomasL> Just bored. :<
[04:01:20] <xec> Sorry, i just don't understand what you meant
[04:01:41] <xec> Or did you mean drag0nius could use classes instead?
[04:02:45] <TuomasL> Yes, but that's of course a different subject going back to desiging the structure as a whole from the start. Not always the case, maybe it's a component from some other source etc.
[04:03:22] <xec> Hehe, you're absolutely right. If that's an option. I just read "From where can come to" and went "what?"
[04:04:24] <TuomasL> :D
[04:04:30] <TuomasL> Yeah, sorry about that.
[04:25:35] <drag0nius> i used those elements in a few different places in the code, querying them each time sucks, so xec's answer is most appropriate
[04:26:37] <Cork> drag0nius: you could use .add if you want to merge them temporally
[04:26:55] <Cork> jqo1.add(jqo2).action()
[04:27:29] <drag0nius> yep, this is what he wrote :P
[04:27:40] <Cork> ah
[04:27:58] <Cork> (only skimmed the answers)
[04:28:41] <steelbrain> Uhkis: Are you still there and Do you have chrome?
[04:28:54] <Uhkis> steelbrain: yes and no
[04:29:08] <newer> Hello
[04:29:08] <newer> I am using jquery ui tabs with datatables, the problem is when you change the tab, the headers of the tables doesnt have width 100% as the body of the table, I think it may be related to this code: http://pastebin.com/pXXT8nHh
[04:29:17] <steelbrain> Uhkis: Okay, so I made some modifications and optimized it a bit, Tell me how it goes http://jsperf.com/dquery-vs-jquery-inserting-dom-elements/2
[04:29:35] <newer> because the first tab, the one loaded by default its ok
[04:30:15] <Uhkis> steelbrain: no freeze or slowdown now and a huge performance difference :-)
[04:30:29] <steelbrain> Uhkis: Yayyyy!
[04:56:16] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[04:56:25] <phpcoder> i ahve this code
[04:56:26] <phpcoder> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ae99aa15cdb9ffaaa116
[04:56:39] <phpcoder> it works...it adds a parameter to the action of the form....
[04:56:49] <phpcoder> the problem is when i click on the same button again and again
[04:57:02] <phpcoder> it adds ?delete=bid ?delete=bid ?delete=bid ?delete=bid
[04:57:05] <phpcoder> again and again
[04:57:22] <phpcoder> is there a better way to add a parameter to a form's action
[04:57:23] <phpcoder> ?
[04:57:35] <Cork> phpcoder: add a hidden field instead
[04:57:44] <Cork> and set the bid to it instead
[04:59:59] <tlkr> phpcoder, you can use an array of you want to delete multiple ids, as Cork said a hidden field with a name of delete[]
[05:00:18] <Cork> he only wants one instance
[05:00:21] <Cork> so no need for []
[05:00:25] <phpcoder> Cork, ok
[05:00:26] <phpcoder> yes
[05:00:37] <phpcoder> i only need "somethibng" to understand where the user has clicked
[05:01:22] * tlkr rubs eyes
[05:43:26] <drag0nius> how can i hide/disable options in select2?
[05:45:48] <Meir`> drag0nius, i cannot understand, please ask more clearly
[05:46:28] <drag0nius> i need to disable some <option>s based on another field's value in a form
[05:46:48] <amore123> I have list with products that is dinamically updated using ajax when the user scroll donw the page. When the user click one product, he is redirected to the page where are the details of the product. The problem: when the user Go back using the brwoser button the page with the product list is not shown but the las ajax call.
[05:48:31] <Meir`> drag0nius, use .attr('disabled','disabled')
[05:49:50] <Meir`> amore123, does the click opens a whole new page?
[05:50:04] <amore123> yes
[05:50:28] <Cork> Meir`: no
[05:50:36] <Cork> never use attr('disabled'
[05:50:37] <Cork> ever
[05:50:40] <Mark_2> anybody know how to animate like this website using only jquery? http://desimer.com/experiment/red/
[05:50:52] <Cork> use prop for field status
[05:51:09] <Mark_2> is adobe edge popular or not? i have never seen anyone using it.
[05:51:25] <Cork> Meir`: so .prop('disabled', true)
[05:51:53] <Meir`> Cork, you're completely right, sorry
[05:52:05] <Meir`> i'm used to the old methods
[05:52:28] <Cork> well its more like attr was split into attr and prop
[05:52:35] <Cork> and prop is basically what .attr used to be
[05:52:44] <Cork> so you should rarely use .attr
[05:52:47] <Meir`> just last week i found myself rewriting a script that handled checkbokes
[05:52:56] <Meir`> checkboxes*
[05:53:14] <Meir`> converting all .attr() to .prop()
[05:54:08] <Cork> there is a few situation where you want to use .attr
[05:54:12] <Cork> but they are rare
[05:54:28] <emx> is there a non-hacky way to get the height of an element having display: none set which was originally display: block?
[05:55:53] <samssh> Cork, Is needing the disabled attribute available to css a reason to use .attr()?
[05:56:11] <Cork> samssh: no
[05:56:26] <Cork> samssh: disabled shouldn't ever be set with attr
[05:56:36] <Cork> it breaks cross browser compatibility
[05:56:41] <Cork> and you gain nothing
[05:57:20] <Cork> samssh: an example of where you want to use attr is from <a href="#somewhere">
[05:57:46] <Cork> prop('href') gives you "http://www.example.com/path/to/html-file.html#somewhere
[05:57:47] <Xatenev> anybody ever used the socialshare privacy
[05:57:52] <Xatenev> jquery plugin?
[05:57:53] <Cork> while attr gives you "#somewhere"
[05:58:21] <Cork> accessing "data-*" attributes as raw element attributes is a second
[05:58:30] <Cork> but those are basically the only two
[05:58:34] <Xatenev> cause its not displaying anything for me :[
[05:58:39] <Cork> every thing else should use prop
[05:59:51] <Xatenev> nobody?^^
[06:01:07] <amore123> any idea Meir` ?
[06:02:10] <Cork> amore123: do you have a way to identify the position in the page?
[06:02:26] <Cork> like id or scroll position or?
[06:03:01] <Cork> amore123: the best solution would be to use either a hash mark and update as you change
[06:03:06] <Cork> and then check it on back
[06:03:14] <Cork> alternatively use history.replaceState
[06:04:25] <amore123> Cork, could you give me any link to hash marks ? what is a hash mark?
[06:04:52] <Cork> amore123: http://www.domain.name/path#hash <--
[06:05:11] <Cork> accesable through window.location.hash
[06:06:34] <amore123> but should I do exactly with the hasmark? should I save it or something like that?
[06:06:47] <amore123> and load it when the user go back?
[06:07:09] <Cork> amore123: either update the hash as the user scrolls the page
[06:07:20] <Cork> or like i said use history.pushState
[06:07:37] <Cork> this means the url will contain an offset the you get back
[06:07:43] <Cork> and you can use it to go to the correct place
[06:09:08] <amore123> ok, but that will solve my current problem? I mean, at this moment when I go back from the product pago to the list product page, what I get is the response of the last ajax call, how to avoid this?
[06:09:39] <Cork> read the two last line i posted
[06:14:55] <amore123> Cork, any tuturial something practical? im still a bit lost..
[06:15:02] <amore123> or something *
[06:15:18] <Cork> amore123: depending on how the page is built up
[06:15:29] <Cork> either store id's for the element you've scrolled to
[06:15:33] <Cork> or and offset from the top
[06:15:41] <Cork> store this value from where you do the ajax call
[06:15:56] <Cork> and just check this has on page load
[06:17:04] <prohobo> this channel should just be renamed Cork's Dojo
[06:17:56] <Xatenev> It should
[06:17:56] <Xatenev> :p
[06:19:22] <abishek> are the 2 function definition the same? http://jsbin.com/tefelafaba/2/ . Do they execute only on document ready?
[06:20:18] <Cork> abishek: yes, the second is a shorthand for the first
[06:20:42] <abishek> Cork, thnx. I never knew this, just saw it in a video and wanted to confirm the same.
[06:20:59] <Cork> abishek: $ has a lots of shorthands in it
[06:21:18] <abishek> ok, is this documented somewhere?
[06:21:28] <Cork> ?api jQuery
[06:21:29] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery(): Accepts a string containing a CSS selector which is then used to match a set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/

[06:25:40] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to make an ajax in my script t a url of my own server but works in another port and I get an error saying something of CORS. What ways I have?
[06:26:24] <Cork> t a?
[06:27:04] <abailarri> t = to
[06:27:22] <Cork> abailarri: you basically only have two options, in modern browsers (excluding ie9) you can have the server send a cors header allowing the cors request
[06:27:36] <Cork> the second option is to use jsonp
[06:27:43] <Cork> but it can only to get calls
[06:28:11] <Cork> well the third option is to use a proxy server to have the two servers on the same address (nginx is a good option for this)
[06:28:25] <abailarri> Cork, what do you recomend?
[06:28:36] <Cork> depends on the limitations you have
[06:28:50] <abailarri> nginx I think that is no option
[06:28:59] <Cork> the nginx reverse proxy is the best solution, if you can choose it
[06:29:07] <Cork> cause it has no limitations on what you can do
[06:29:18] <abailarri> Cork, but do you say two servers. Are the same but in different ports
[06:29:23] <Cork> jsnop fakes around the cors by loading js
[06:29:47] <Cork> abailarri: no nginx can route paths for the same domain to several servers
[06:30:03] <Cork> http://www.example.com/path1 => server1
[06:30:06] <Cork> http://www.example.com/path2 => server2
[06:30:13] <abailarri> I'm working with etherpad, and I want to make a call to the api for delete pads. Then this call is in the same domain but in a 9001 port
[06:30:20] <amore123> Cork it is me again.. as far as I understand I should save the hash mark before going to the product's page, but HOW to save that hash, what should I use? a php variable session? a javascript variable? a browser variable?
[06:30:38] <Cork> amore123: no you don't
[06:30:50] <Cork> the browser stores the url in the history as it goes to the next url
[06:31:03] <Cork> you just have to check for it as the page "shows" again
[06:31:45] <Cork> abailarri: that is what i''m telling you, either put a reverse proxy infront so they exist on the same domain
[06:32:18] <Cork> like www.eterpad.mine => etherpad and www.eterpad.mine/api => port 9001
[06:32:38] <Cork> or you would have to modify the code on the remote server to send cors headers
[06:32:52] <Cork> or rewrite the api to use jsonp
[06:33:04] <Cork> those are you're options
[06:33:05] <cdaringe> hi all.  I am wondering if it is standard practice for jQ to emit DOM events when widgets update controls.  for instance, i use a date picker.  should I expect a 'change' event to be emitted?  I know there is `.on(...)` functions available, but I want a different lib to react the changing input values
[06:33:45] <Cork> cdaringe: widgets normally fire events for all the callbacks they take
[06:33:53] <Cork> they are normally prefixed, but not always
[06:34:08] <abailarri> I understand, then If the ajax calls to https://myaqpp.dev/api/1/deletePad the proxy reverse caches and redirects to https://myaqpp.dev:9001/api/1/deletePad ?
[06:34:10] <cdaringe> such as `jq_change` or `jquery_some_event`
[06:34:15] <amore123> Cork, but I have checked that keeping the position of the page before is something that the browser do automatically, without adding any code
[06:34:28] <Cork> cdaringe: no ex slider-step
[06:34:52] <Cork> amore123: sure, but the original html is rerendered
[06:34:56] <Cork> so waht js added is lost
[06:35:04] <Cork> you need to fetch that again
[06:43:08] <amore123> Do you mean I need to fetch again using ajax? or is there any other way?
[06:43:51] <amore123> Cork,
[06:49:12] <Joonaa> Hello, I'd like to detect if range type input is being dragged by the user, is there something I could use?
[06:50:31] <Omar-> Joonaa listen to "change" event
[06:51:28] <Joonaa> im listening to it, but i change the slider (its for html5 audio) when the audio file progresses, and that cancels the dragging if user stops moving it
[06:53:12] <abailarri> Cork, I added ProxyPass rule on my Vhost and when I launch the ajax I get 500 error. I know that this channel is not for this purpose
[06:57:19] <workerbeetwo> Hi
[06:57:53] <toter> Hi everybody... On this first example, http://hastebin.com/elaxowuwey, I can send the 'postName' id value to another page using <input type="hidden" id="postName" name="postName">
[06:58:08] <toter> On this second example, http://hastebin.com/yufunecala, I can't...
[06:58:17] <workerbeetwo> How would you check whether a specific element exists ?  like "<h3> special </h3>"
[06:58:36] <toter> Is there something I need to add on the second example to be able to send the value of 'postName' to another page via <input>?
[07:00:07] <Cork> workerbeetwo: $('h3').length > 0
[07:00:27] <Cork> workerbeetwo: you should normally try to avoid selecting based on the text inside the element though
[07:00:34] <NoiseEee> toter: look at the documentation for "filepicker" ?
[07:00:35] <Cork> add a class or id on the element if you need to
[07:01:38] <workerbeetwo> Cork: yes. unfortunately I have to. it is a post processing script to fix bugs from "the outside" sotospeak.
[07:01:45] <Cork> toter: i suspect the first one uses a full page post, while the second uses ajax
[07:01:55] <Cork> toter: and in that case you get blocked by cors
[07:02:45] <Cork> workerbeetwo: $('h3:contains("special")').length > 0
[07:02:46] <toter> Cork: Thanks
[07:02:59] <workerbeetwo> Cork: wow. thats easy.
[07:03:02] <Cork> workerbeetwo:  but be careful with this it is, it is very slow and you search every thing
[07:03:10] <Cork> including links and html tags
[07:03:38] <workerbeetwo> Cork: hmm yea. thanks. Ill try that.
[07:04:25] <Cork> abailarri: proxypass?
[07:04:31] <Cork> in what?
[07:04:58] <abailarri> Cork, I think that i solved, Let me check
[07:19:37] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[07:19:48] <MajorWork> o/
[07:19:50] <BarnaSzalai> how to hide a div during a scroll event?
[07:20:10] <Cork> during a scroll event might be tricky, depending on the device
[07:20:13] <BarnaSzalai> and when scrolling stops, show it
[07:20:20] <Cork> (scroll events are async on mobiles)
[07:20:26] <BarnaSzalai> ah
[07:20:32] <Cork> but that is basically you're option
[07:20:33] <BarnaSzalai> workaround?
[07:20:39] <Cork> there isn't really one
[07:20:45] <Cork> you can only do a best effort
[07:20:58] <Cork> so onscroll hide the element
[07:21:04] <Cork> and then in a setTimeout show it again
[07:21:15] <BarnaSzalai> hm thanks
[07:21:18] <Cork> how long to wait for the next scroll event it up to you
[07:21:43] <MajorWork> Hey I'm making a comments table to be beneath each blog post. I'm toggling by ID however if I have more than one element with the same id it seems to cease to work. I've learnt a little about using 'this' and parent/child lately but im no expert. My question is what should I name my toggle button and comments table so that I wont have to tweak it as I add new blog posts ?
[07:22:16] <BarnaSzalai> Cork: so I cant get when a scroll event ends?
[07:22:35] <MajorWork> I get bunged down in loop holes of incrementing variables when I really just need to understand js better
[07:23:30] <Cork> BarnaSzalai: you can, but that isn't what you want
[07:23:44] <Cork> scroll event end would just be the end of the execution if the js callback
[07:24:08] <Cork> only way to know if scrolling has stopped is by there not being more scroll instructions from the user
[07:24:23] <Cork> kinda hard to mind read what the user plan to do :)
[07:25:08] <frank_o> Cork: not if you've taken mrs parson's mind reading course, but whatever
[07:25:11] <BarnaSzalai> ok
[07:25:30] <Cork> MajorWork: simplest is to use a class to identify the elements
[07:25:33] <Cork> and then work from there
[07:25:49] <Cork> if you want more specific help you need to provide a code snippet
[07:25:51] <Cork> ?paste
[07:25:52] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:26:13] <MajorWork> that would hide and show all comments at the same time right?
[07:26:19] <MajorWork> $(this).next I found this and going to try it
[07:26:21] <Cork> no
[07:26:55] <Cork> MajorWork: yes $(this).next() for a click on the element is the right solution
[07:27:00] <Cork> or similar options
[07:27:09] <Cork> but hard to help without seeing what you're working with
[07:27:20] <MajorWork> erm blog.tvno.co.uk
[07:27:35] <Cork> snippets preferably
[07:27:41] <MajorWork> sure
[07:27:42] <Cork> they can be modified to show how to fix something
[07:27:53] <Cork> and digging through a site takes more them then i can spend
[07:29:00] <BarnaSzalai> Cork: setTimeout solution working
[07:29:19] <Cork> BarnaSzalai: don't forget to clearTimeout on scroll event
[07:29:23] <Cork> so you don't queue a ton of them
[07:29:41] <BarnaSzalai> did it
[07:29:47] <Cork> k
[07:30:54] <MajorWork> Cork,  https://pastee.org/c6c45 help me i'm irish :)
[07:31:12] <Cork> please use jsfiddle next time
[07:31:28] <MajorWork> sure
[07:31:42] <Cork> ah, no you can't use next to get around that an id identifies an unique element
[07:32:11] <Cork> so ya, you want to use a class instead
[07:32:13] <MajorWork> jsfiddle is the bane of my existence lately as i have a really big project i need help with but i can't get all the dependencies or create a test case without them as i don't understand the css and javascript completely so don't know what i need
[07:32:39] <Cork> MajorWork: it doesn't have to be fully working
[07:32:43] <MajorWork> using a class and with the this.next will that only do one at a time
[07:32:49] <Cork> MajorWork: jsfiddle makes it easy to modify and give back the changes
[07:32:58] <Cork> and it has tools to clean up html and js
[07:33:08] <Cork> THAT is the major benefits of it
[07:33:59] <Cork> if you had put in a bit of generated html instead of php you would have been set :)
[07:36:04] <Cork> MajorWork: but the html doesn't make sense
[07:36:17] <Cork> you have i and p inside table
[07:36:24] <Cork> not inside a td
[07:36:25] <MajorWork> I do
[07:36:33] <MajorWork> when something stops working i start messing around
[07:36:38] <MajorWork> and it often gets left there
[07:36:45] <Cork> MajorWork: the html is invalid
[07:36:48] <MajorWork> i'm in the infancy of my career i will sand off all these quirks
[07:36:48] <Cork> and gets moved by the browser
[07:36:52] <Cork> you REALLY should fix that
[07:37:01] <MajorWork> it works though
[07:37:05] <MajorWork> not always as expected
[07:37:11] <Cork> MajorWork: uh.. you should learn to write valid html
[07:37:13] <MajorWork> I'll tidy it would prettify solve mit
[07:37:21] <Cork> if you WANT a career...
[07:37:22] <MajorWork> what is wrong with having italics in a table?
[07:37:28] <MajorWork> I have a job
[07:37:30] <MajorWork> :)
[07:37:33] <Cork> cause this is junk, and you WILL get problem from it

[07:37:51] <MajorWork> I'm a systems developer who enjoys web development
[07:37:51] <Cork> make sure the html validates before you ask a question here again
[07:38:05] <MajorWork> hey
[07:38:16] <MajorWork> I know you're resident expert
[07:38:23] <Cork> no
[07:38:30] <MajorWork> nice
[07:38:43] <MajorWork> Everyday I come here for a month you're name is the most frequent
[07:38:46] <MajorWork> You are resident expert
[07:38:49] <Cork> its plain idiotic trying to run dom selectors on a tree you don't know how it looks
[07:39:03] <MajorWork> hey man
[07:39:08] <Cork> and not fixing the broken html before you start is a waist of my time
[07:39:08] <MajorWork> I know my codes offended you
[07:39:11] <Cork> and do ya
[07:39:13] <MajorWork> but no need to offend me
[07:39:19] <Cork> you're on you're own if you don't care
[07:39:29] <MajorWork> waiste of your time is a belt with a clock on it
[07:39:32] <MajorWork> I do care
[07:39:43] <MajorWork> go easy
[07:39:58] <MajorWork> calling me idiotic
[07:40:03] <MajorWork> telling me i'll never have a career
[07:40:07] <MajorWork> unnecessary slights

[07:40:27] <Cork> make that bar green
[07:40:28] <MajorWork> if you choose to look at my code and it isn't to your standards "I" have not wasted your time
[07:40:28] <lejocelyn> I'm not sure to understand how promise works
[07:40:49] <lejocelyn> do I have the right to have ajax function with argument to design promise function ?
[07:41:04] <lejocelyn> (promise returning function)
[07:41:21] <Cork> MajorWork: and before you start set a valid doctype
[07:41:32] <Cork> <!doctype html> should solve a lot of those errors
[07:41:40] <Cork> but ya, the html is horrible
[07:41:46] <MajorWork> Ok cheers for the direction
[07:41:47] <spikeheadon> agree
[07:42:26] <MikeD_> "You should not pass lengthy HTML strings to $, but use $.parseHTML instead. "  <-- what's the threshold for 'lengthy' ?
[07:42:44] <Cork> lejocelyn: if you by promise mean deferred, $.ajax returns a deferred by default
[07:42:56] <lejocelyn> ok
[07:43:06] <MikeD_> also, why isn't there an internal decision to use one or the other so I don't have to care?
[07:43:10] <MajorWork> I have a doctype on that page its a link to w3schools
[07:43:13] <Cork> MikeD_: i would say if you don't write it inline as a one liner, use $.parseHTML
[07:43:24] <Cork> ...
[07:43:33] <Cork> MajorWork: that explains a lot
[07:43:37] <Cork> ?g w3fools
[07:43:38] <b-ot> Cork: W3Fools – Better web education for all → http://www.w3fools.com/
[07:43:49] <Cork> don't use w3schools for anything
[07:43:56] <Cork> especially learning web standards
[07:44:06] <dcherman> Cork: no it doesn't, it returns a promise which is a subset of the deferred.  does the returned value have a `.resolve` function?
[07:44:16] <Xatenev> Honestly I don't think w3schools is that bad @Cork
[07:44:30] <Cork> Xatenev: it is, it is horrible
[07:44:34] <Xatenev> Its quite a good entry point cause you get fast informations there
[07:44:34] <MikeD_> don't use w3schools for anything, or if you're going to ignore this advice, don't use it for anything else either.
[07:44:36] <Xatenev> dont think so
[07:44:43] <dcherman> more specifically a jqXHR object that has promise functionality mixed in.
[07:44:45] <Cork> Xatenev: you can see if a user comes from there by the type of problem they have
[07:44:46] <Xatenev> Sure the mozilla doc
[07:44:52] <Xatenev> is quite a bit bigger with more and better infos
[07:45:05] <Cork> Xatenev: w3schools teaches to do things the wrong way
[07:45:08] <Cork> the very wrong way
[07:45:12] <Xatenev> can u give me an example?
[07:45:26] <Cork> you have one a few lines up for a starter
[07:45:28] <Xatenev> I didnt see that much "very wrong ways" on w3
[07:45:33] <Cork> xhtml doctype
[07:45:33] <MikeD_> !w3fools
[07:45:49] <Cork> Xatenev: the list is long
[07:46:07] <Xatenev> I dont think most of them are breaking "wrong ways" though^^
[07:46:09] <Cork> basically they don't keep it up to date with how you write good pages
[07:46:17] <lejocelyn> Cork: why could I have the deferred object as undefined ?
[07:46:20] <Cork> they still teach to write pages like how you did in the late 90's
[07:46:33] <Cork> lejocelyn: not sure what you mean
[07:46:39] <Cork> lejocelyn: what exactly are you trying to do?
[07:46:40] <MikeD_> the only thing you should study w3schools for is their excellent google pagerank
[07:46:50] <Cork> heh TRUE XD
[07:46:51] <Xatenev> but they teach how to write pages in the late 90s quite good, and from there u can get up and learn better standards n stuff
[07:46:53] <MikeD_> which just shows you how right or wrong doesn't matter for SEO
[07:47:05] <Xatenev> imho
[07:47:15] <Cork> Xatenev: except you shouldn't write pages like you did in the late 90's
[07:47:24] <lejocelyn> Cork: I have an an ajax fonction getting json data, I'd like to store that data into a variable
[07:47:26] <Cork> the web has luckelly been largely fixed since then
[07:47:27] <MajorWork> I've been abusing the table tag for quite sometime
[07:47:47] <Xatenev> Cork: why shouldnt u just start with something and learn how its done better?
[07:47:50] <Cork> lejocelyn: ok?
[07:47:54] <MikeD_> MajorWork: the first step is to admit that you have a problem
[07:48:15] <Cork> lejocelyn: $().done(function(data) { window.myData = data; })
[07:48:28] <lejocelyn> http://fpaste.org/180943/
[07:49:08] <Cork> lejocelyn: and searchKeywords?
[07:49:41] <Cork> does function(search) { return $.ajax(url, { data: { q: search } }); }
[07:49:42] <Cork> or what?
[07:50:04] <lejocelyn> Cork: oups : http://fpaste.org/180944/22978593/
[07:50:31] <Cork> lejocelyn: you're returning the ajax call to the submit event handler
[07:50:40] <Cork> not from searchKeywords
[07:50:47] <lejocelyn> ahhh
[07:51:07] <Cork> lejocelyn: simplest is to use $.Callbacks()
[07:51:31] <lejocelyn> I don't know that yet
[07:52:25] <Cork> lejocelyn: also define you're variables
[07:53:08] <Cork> lejocelyn: http://jsfiddle.net/z9pe481n/
[07:56:07] <MikeD_> how do I reference the containing/wrapper node from a fragment of html that's in a string passed to $.parseHTML() ?
[07:56:40] <Cork> MikeD_: there isn't a wrapper node
[07:56:44] <MikeD_> ex: http://jsfiddle.net/vzbq0usv/
[07:57:06] <Cork> ah
[07:57:21] <Cork> MikeD_: $.parseHTML returns a dom node, not a jquery object
[07:57:30] <Cork> you want $($.parseHTML())
[07:57:33] <lejocelyn> Cork: thanks
[07:57:41] <Cork> or reverse the code
[07:57:43] <MikeD_> and that's "better" ?
[07:57:58] <Cork> $('#output').append($.parseHTML( somehtml ))
[07:58:01] <R13ose> if I click on a link and the url becomes example.com/#updates and content popsup, when I click the close button, how do I return the url to read example.com ?
[07:58:18] <Cork> MikeD_: you don't really have to run .parseHTML for append
[07:58:27] <Cork> its only when you give it to $() you should do so
[07:58:28] <workerbeetwo> is this correct ? var newDiv = $('<div>'); $(newDiv).add('<p>bla</p>');  the div is still empty after it.
[07:58:43] <Cork> workerbeetwo: append, not add
[07:58:55] <Cork> add adds the element to the jquery selection array
[07:59:01] <Cork> it doesn't touch the dom
[07:59:01] <MikeD_> so if I want to keep the object reference so i can later append to the newly created object...?
[07:59:23] <Cork> MikeD_: $($.parseHTML())
[07:59:49] <Cork> ^ this is needed cause $ is overloaded
[08:00:19] <Cork> so html can be interpreted as a selector
[08:01:03] <MikeD_> so how is $($.parseHTML( somehtml ) )  better than $( somehtml )  ?
[08:01:19] <Cork> $.parseHTML() means $() gets a dom element
[08:01:21] <Cork> not a string
[08:01:34] <Cork> so it doesn't have to sniff the html to try to guess if it is a selector or html
[08:01:43] <MikeD_> and that's cleaner/cheaper to implement?
[08:01:48] <Cork> its safe
[08:02:08] <Cork> for example leading spaces has a few versions back caused $() to think the html is a selector
[08:02:31] <Cork> that specific example has been fixed, but there are harder cases that isn't easily fixed
[08:02:46] <MikeD_> hmm
[08:04:37] <workerbeetwo> Cork: ah ok. thx.
[08:05:19] <MajorWork> 'blog'><tr>Blog Posts</tr><tr>IFRAME EMPTY  whats wrong with my closing tr tag?

[08:13:32] <MajorWork> ignore me
[08:23:24] <Xatenev> Cork: are u actually answering questions on SO?
[08:37:39] <Tawre> what's a pretty way to iterate through all the keys of an object and get their values?
[08:37:59] <Tawre> i was thinking Object.keys(foo).forEach but this would mean that what i'd be getting is the key
[08:38:03] <Tawre> ah nvm i guess this is good enough
[08:39:25] <cjohnson> you can use the key to fetch the value :)
[08:39:42] <Tawre> yeah i know
[08:40:06] <Tawre> i just figured i could somehow have the value given to the forEach as input to be the value
[08:40:13] <Tawre> but meh data[key] is good enough i guess
[08:40:29] <R13ose> any thoughts on my problem?
[08:41:10] <cjohnson> Tawre: well jquery's .each iterates over objects and provides both key and value
[08:41:27] <Tawre> i know, i'm not using jquery sadly; i just find this to be the most sensible javascript channel
[08:41:49] <cjohnson> there's ##javascript, quite sensible
[08:41:56] <Tawre> nope
[08:42:15] <Tawre> i was told there to either accept the gender politics or leave
[08:42:26] <cjohnson> it's a channel, not a dictatorship
[08:42:34] <Tawre> ljharb disagrees
[08:42:37] <cjohnson> you can ignore disruptive people
[08:42:41] <cjohnson> you can /ignore ljharb
[08:42:43] <cjohnson> even
[08:42:56] <Tawre> i was just doing some simple data manipulation anyway for some personal stuff
[08:43:05] <cjohnson> just ignore the derailing comments, it's a pretty useful channel
[08:43:07] <Tawre> and just want to carry habits around to make code more readable, especially if i have time
[08:43:21] <cjohnson> anyway using vanilla JS your only answer is the Object.keys.forEach
[08:43:27] <Tawre> yeah
[08:43:30] <cjohnson> there's nothing that gives you both in a convenient callback
[08:43:32] <Tawre> i already went with:
[08:43:46] <Tawre> Object.keys(data).forEach(function (key) { data[key].blah...
[08:43:58] <cjohnson> mhm
[08:45:24] <Tawre> _.map would've been nicer though
[08:47:01] <cjohnson> well you can always rip that function out
[08:47:06] <cjohnson> not hard
[08:48:03] <Tawre> well i was literally writing in notepad and copypasting to a console to run it
[08:48:07] <inthl> I am using $.ajax to request html-forms from another resource, these are being added by $('somediv').html(result); ... now as known these forms are not being added to the DOM. is there some way to do that? I would require some action on classes and forms that were served with that $.ajax()
[08:48:35] <robertmaxrees> inthl is the ajax request successfully completing?
[08:48:40] <inthl> yes
[08:49:00] <inthl> these forms are being added on success, which works very fine
[08:49:27] <robertmaxrees> wait what do you mean "are not being added to the DOM"?
[08:49:30] <notchris|work> How do I do “not this”
[08:49:41] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work depends on the context.
[08:50:04] <notchris|work> Basically, I have a menu item that when clicked opens a dropdown with the class “shown"
[08:50:13] <notchris|work> I want to remove all other open dropdowns when the selected one is open
[08:50:31] <inthl> robertmaxrees, means that I can not work with elements returned in that request. e.g. there is a input button with a specific class say classfoo. now I can not use $('.classfoo').click(...); on these which were returned by $.ajax
[08:50:35] <notchris|work> So I wanna say
[08:50:36] <notchris|work> $('.sub-menu')
[08:50:39] <cjohnson> select all open dropdowns $('div.shown') maybe, and remove the shown class with removeClass
[08:50:42] <cjohnson> something like that
[08:50:45] <notchris|work> But not this sub-menu
[08:50:48] <robertmaxrees> $('.shown').removeClass('shown'); $(this).addClass('shown');, notchris|work
[08:50:50] <inthl> obviously because they are not part of the current DOM. So I'd need some kind of dom-reload after $.ajax requests
[08:51:03] <robertmaxrees> inthl they ARE aded to the dom :) you need event delegation.
[08:51:03] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: Thanks, trying this now
[08:51:20] <inthl> ehm..what is that
[08:51:20] <inthl> ?
[08:51:21] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work that assumes i understood the question :)
[08:51:37] <robertmaxrees> inthl http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[08:51:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, you bind to a parent element that exists on pageload and isn't replaced.
[08:52:01] <cjohnson> inthl: it sounds like you are binding an event, and *then* loading some elements onto the DOM via ajax. so at the time of binding, those elements don't exist, and as such can't be bound
[08:52:10] <inthl> ah yes, I read about that - I am using $("form").submit(function (event) { ... but the problem is that I could not figure out how to do that
[08:52:17] <robertmaxrees> that's not using delegation.
[08:52:28] <inthl> on.('submit', 'form or something did not work. what would be the equivalent here?
[08:52:39] <robertmaxrees> $('someDiv').on('submit', 'form', function() {});
[08:52:41] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[08:52:45] <robertmaxrees> assuming someDiv exists on pageload.
[08:52:57] <inthl> that could be 'body' as well, true?
[08:53:00] <robertmaxrees> and is a static ancestor of the element you're adding.
[08:53:06] <robertmaxrees> sure, but I'd avoid adding it to body if you can.
[08:53:09] <notchris|work> So I’m understanding more
[08:53:14] <R13ose> :(
[08:53:15] <notchris|work> Say “this” is understood
[08:53:21] <cjohnson> I think body would be fine for submit events but avoid it for anything common like click or mouse events
[08:53:21] <notchris|work> But you wanted to change a child of this
[08:53:22] <jakesy> >> this
[08:53:27] <inthl> hm. give me a minute to try that out. thanks for the hint
[08:53:32] <Tawre> hey should i go with node on heroku or something else?
[08:53:38] <Tawre> for a small application
[08:53:48] <cjohnson> you should go with what you're familiar with, or something you want to experiment with
[08:53:51] <notchris|work> Say this has a div inside it called “example”
[08:53:53] <robertmaxrees> Tawre i like heroku, though it can get pricey quick if you're not careful.
[08:53:53] <cjohnson> something that fits your needs :P
[08:53:58] <notchris|work> $(this.example)    ?
[08:54:04] <Tawre> i need to use heroku for university soon
[08:54:08] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work $(this).find('someThing');
[08:54:16] <robertmaxrees> or $('something', this);
[08:54:18] <notchris|work> robertmaxrees: Ah!
[08:54:21] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson i still say you shouldn't bind to the document or body.
[08:54:29] <Tawre> i've done some stuff with IIS in the past, and was thinking of trying out a small application that would make my life a bit easier to track my bloodpressure measurements
[08:54:44] <Tawre> so i think i'd fall in the almost no cost portion
[08:54:52] <cjohnson> it's not like submit events are going to flood your document, I don't think it really matters here
[08:54:54] <robertmaxrees> that should be fine.  you'd fall in free no problem.
[08:54:56] <Tawre> the question is rather whether i should go with node or something else for serverside
[08:55:09] <robertmaxrees> cjohnson until you end up cluttering the document/body with a ton of handlers ;)
[08:55:23] <robertmaxrees> which is why i argue that you scope them down a little further.
[08:55:35] <cjohnson> sometimes. sometimes not. I don't think the impact is big enough to care here
[08:55:40] <cjohnson> that's me tho
[08:55:46] <robertmaxrees> it is when it'll confuse other devs imo.
[08:56:01] <cjohnson> there's just as much possible confusing trying to find another good ancestor
[08:56:29] <R13ose> if I click on a link and content popped up that shows the url as example.com/#updates When I click the close button, how do I return the url to read example.com?
[08:56:30] <robertmaxrees> i disagree - if you pay attention and name things appropriately, you can cut down on that confusion real quick.
[08:56:49] <cjohnson> you're disagreeing with something I didn't say. I'm not saying you can't cut down on that confusion
[08:57:04] <cjohnson> I'm saying it *can* be confusing to find a good ancesotr, just like it *can* be confusing binding a bunch of handlers to document
[08:57:12] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[08:57:17] <robertmaxrees> whatever broseph.
[08:57:18] <cjohnson> imo, negligible difference. not worth arguing over
[08:57:24] <inthl> robertmaxrees, hm, now some other problem comes in. for $("form").submit(function (event) { ... I used in that function e.g.: $(this).attr('method').toLowerCase() ..... or $(this).serialize(); .. now that does not work in that contect any more. I am not sure now, do I need some identifier stuff to know what form was submitted (there are more than one) and to replace that with $(this) ..?
[08:57:26] <notchris|work> So it worked @robertmaxrees
[08:57:27] <notchris|work> http://pastebin.com/wZzAUUfZ
[08:57:29] <cjohnson> especially not when I clearly stated that that's just my opinion
[08:57:30] <robertmaxrees> i think it's way more important than you thing.
[08:57:31] <robertmaxrees> *think.
[08:57:36] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[08:57:37] <notchris|work> But clicking on the same item now wont close the current menu
[08:57:38] <cjohnson> you're free to hold that opinion
[08:57:43] <cjohnson> just like I am mine
[08:57:59] <robertmaxrees> inthl could you paste up in a fiddle or something similar?
[08:58:32] <robertmaxrees> trying to understand what exactly you're wrangling.
[08:59:01] <inthl> robertmaxrees, well these 2 were the ones that are used in that context, there is nothing more in particular to see. it is simply that with $('body').on('submit', 'form', function() { ... I can not use e.g. $(this).serialize(); any more
[08:59:12] <robertmaxrees> yes you can.
[08:59:17] <robertmaxrees> $(this) refers to the form that was submitted.
[08:59:50] <jakesy> which is incredibly useful
[09:00:13] <inthl> it does?
[09:00:17] <inthl> give me another minute .
[09:00:37] <inthl> oh it does
[09:00:52] <inthl> i forgot to add function(event), there was just function() ...so event.preventDefault did not work :>
[09:00:57] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:01:01] <robertmaxrees> that'll do it.
[09:01:09] <inthl> thanks a lot for the help
[09:01:15] <robertmaxrees> of course!
[09:02:23] <robertmaxrees> notchris|work what was the issue?
[09:02:32] <notchris|work> http://pastebin.com/wZzAUUfZ
[09:02:41] <notchris|work> Clicking a currently opened item will not close it
[09:02:47] <R13ose> seems my question is not been answered
[09:02:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to check if the current one is open, then.
[09:02:57] <notchris|work> Ahh
[09:02:59] <robertmaxrees> R13ose sorry - might have missed it. what was the issue?
[09:03:26] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right - "popping up" is ephemeral.  could you be more specific?
[09:03:37] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: look above, this was sent just 7 mins ago
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> a lot happened between then and now :) see my latest question :)
[09:04:26] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: if I click on a link and content popped up that shows the url as example.com/#updates When I click the close button, how do I return the url to read example.com?
[09:04:39] <robertmaxrees> right - define "poppup up"
[09:04:43] <robertmaxrees> *popped
[09:06:40] <robertmaxrees> if you mean clicking that link navigated the user to another page, then there's nothing you can really do since they're closing the window.
[09:07:03] <robertmaxrees> if you mean a popup window of some kind, you shouldn't need to do any navigation at all.
[09:08:28] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I am saying to show a div that is hidden when I click the link.  I want example.com/#updates when I click the link and example.com when I click to close the div.
[09:08:57] <robertmaxrees> if your browser supports pushstates, you can use those.
[09:09:05] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you can only get to example.com/#
[09:09:13] <robertmaxrees> or example.com/#updates
[09:09:33] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: pushstates?
[09:10:05] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you want to modify the page's URL.  if you only care about hashes, then you can rely on window.location.hash.
[09:10:55] <robertmaxrees> so $('.expandDiv').on('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); window.location.hash = 'updates'; openUpdates(); });
[09:11:11] <robertmaxrees> then your close code would do window.location.hash = '';
[09:11:41] <robertmaxrees> be aware, however, that when you do window.location.hash = ''; some (most?) browsers will leave the # at the end of the url.
[09:11:47] <robertmaxrees> so you'll have example.com/#
[09:12:01] <jakesy> which is the same right? just ugly
[09:12:11] <jakesy> unless you can set an anchor to have a 0 length id..?
[09:12:29] <robertmaxrees> that'll force a page scroll to the top iirc.
[09:12:38] <robertmaxrees> maybe not though. i'd have to check.
[09:12:42] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: how do I make this not have #?
[09:13:16] <robertmaxrees> R13ose in old browsers, you don't have much of a choice without basiclaly reloading the page.
[09:13:26] <robertmaxrees> in newer browsers, you use pushstates - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[09:13:41] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: how old are you talking about?
[09:13:57] <robertmaxrees> pushstates are only supported in IE10 and above.
[09:14:13] <jakesy> why is IE so evil
[09:14:20] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: there is no other way to get rid of the /#updates?
[09:14:32] <robertmaxrees> R13ose not without reloading the page, no.
[09:14:40] <robertmaxrees> jakesy FF 3.6 sucked, too ;)
[09:15:13] <jakesy> yeah but that's when it was still a shadow in the colossus of netscape right?
[09:15:38] <robertmaxrees> that was 2010
[09:15:48] <jakesy> oh
[09:15:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:15:53] <jakesy> nevermind >_>
[09:15:55] <robertmaxrees> IE10 was 2011
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> same month as FF4 for devs iirc.
[09:16:37] <jakesy> I thought ff was in version 20ish like chrome is in 40
[09:16:41] <jakesy> I have no idea why
[09:16:41] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: what is the alternative for this?  Like what you do in this case?  The overall reason why I want the /#updates is that if someone goes to that link, they can see the div popup.
[09:16:57] <robertmaxrees> R13ose support pushstates in browsers that support it, otherwise hashes.
[09:16:59] <robertmaxrees> or just hashes.
[09:17:27] <robertmaxrees> jakesy this article is 2 years old now, but is pretty englightening about "old IE" vs "old webkit" - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[09:17:34] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong link - http://blog.methvin.com/2013/02/tragedy-of-webkit-commons.html
[09:18:10] <MikeD_> I would like some suggestion for how to approach this problem - I want as cheap&easy as possible and not sure how to do that without over-building  http://jsfiddle.net/4vtf4f3y/
[09:20:05] <robertmaxrees> why is .text() a hack?
[09:21:09] <MikeD_> well, used the way I did to roughly approximate what I want, it doesn't really return what I want :)
[09:21:19] <robertmaxrees> i see what oyu mean :)
[09:21:26] <robertmaxrees> use .val() to grab the value of form elements.
[09:21:41] <robertmaxrees> $('input').val() and $('select').val();
[09:21:53] <MikeD_> so do I iterate all the elements and do stuff inside the loop?
[09:22:04] <robertmaxrees> that sometext that's not wrapped in a node or anything is going to be a PITA.
[09:22:20] <robertmaxrees> basically, yeah
[09:22:28] <robertmaxrees> actually, not.
[09:22:31] <robertmaxrees> *no - one sec.
[09:22:49] <jakesy> ughh, why are jQ iterator callbacks (i,x) and vanilla iterator callbacks (x,i)
[09:23:00] <MikeD_> i wouldn't even mind cloning the content and throwing it into the LI
[09:23:20] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ cloning won't work becase it doesn't necessarily maintain state.
[09:23:21] <MikeD_> jakesy: indeed
[09:23:50] <MikeD_> i don't care about the state, it only has to get the content when you hit the summarize button
[09:24:06] <MikeD_> the real app has that on an in-your-face dialog
[09:24:12] <robertmaxrees> so you don't care what value is currently selected?
[09:24:25] <MikeD_> i do, but it doesn't need to stay synchronized
[09:24:29] <MikeD_> and it'll be read-only
[09:24:32] <robertmaxrees> right, then you care about state.
[09:24:42] <robertmaxrees> because cloning doesn't necessarily copy the current value of form elements.
[09:24:47] <MikeD_> oh
[09:24:52] <robertmaxrees> one sec, let me show you the basic idea of what i'd do.
[09:24:58] <MikeD_> cool, thanks
[09:25:58] <robertmaxrees> is it at all possible to wrap that sometext in an element?
[09:26:02] <jakesy> couldn't you do $('dt', '.uhspa_orderable').each also
[09:26:24] <robertmaxrees> no need to :)
[09:26:36] <jakesy> but but but, pedantry...
[09:27:50] <MikeD_> aren't the naked text in their own node?
[09:28:11] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ yes, but it's a massive PITA to try to select based on that textnode.
[09:28:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/4vtf4f3y/2/
[09:28:35] <robertmaxrees> i can add that bit in, but it won't be pretty.
[09:31:12] <MikeD_> don't sweat it, i just needed some discussion on how to get something "good enough" since .text() didn't quite cut it
[09:31:32] <robertmaxrees> .text() is basically to retrieve text.  .val() is for form control values.
[09:31:37] <robertmaxrees> you wanted both.
[09:31:55] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: I got this working.  Thanks for your help.  The other problem is how do I make the div shown if I go to example.com/#updates?
[09:31:55] <MikeD_> right, what it does for select is unintuitive
[09:32:15] <robertmaxrees> R13ose on pageload, read the window.location.hash.
[09:32:31] <robertmaxrees> if it matches, show the div.
[09:32:45] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: trying
[09:32:47] <jakesy> or :target in css
[09:33:10] <robertmaxrees> that assumes the page only needs to scroll to the div.
[09:48:07] <wheeei-AFK> know of any good guides to write a simple pop-up with jQuery ? Tried to google but havent found many good guides
[09:48:17] <robertmaxrees> popup or modal?
[09:48:42] <wheeei-AFK> robertmaxrees modal, I guess
[09:48:57] <wheeei-AFK> robertmaxrees just a div-popup is that "modal" ?
[09:49:01] <R13ose> robertmaxrees: thanks, everything is working now.
[09:49:08] <robertmaxrees> R13ose awesome :)
[09:49:41] <robertmaxrees> wheeei-AFK if you want an element (like a div) to show up over the rest of the page, that's a modal.
[09:49:58] <robertmaxrees> there are a lot of tutorials out there for it.
[09:50:22] <wheeei-AFK> robertmaxrees ok thats what I want! =) Without any extra plugins etc, only jQuery... ok I will try google on modal
[09:50:33] <robertmaxrees> basic gist is pretty simple - set up a div with fixed positioning that's centered in the screen and hide/show it using JS.
[09:51:55] <R13ose> robertmaxrees++
[09:52:41] <robertmaxrees> hah, thanks :)
[09:52:47] <jakesy> though, jquery ui's modal aint bad
[09:52:54] <HikaruBG> hi guys!
[09:53:10] <robertmaxrees> he can't use an external plugin or lib.
[09:53:16] <robertmaxrees> code sample for a new job iirc.
[09:53:20] <HikaruBG> I have a problem detecting the char keyCode with Android Firefox browser. Any ideas?
[09:53:46] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG need more detail than that.
[09:53:57] <jakesy> is event.keyCode not giving you a string?
[09:56:47] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, I have <input type="text"> field. I need to develop code that will prevent characters and allow only digits to be input into the field
[09:57:10] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG alright - and what's the problem?
[09:57:13] <R13ose> afk
[09:57:17] <HikaruBG> I am trying to detect the CharCode (or KeyCode) with e.which || e.keyCode
[09:57:35] <HikaruBG> or e.charCode and it won't get it to me - all of them are undefined
[09:58:19] <HikaruBG> also - other browsers (chrome based) on android fire keyDown events and Firefox fires only input event
[09:58:20] <HikaruBG> ?
[09:58:21] <HikaruBG> :)
[09:58:58] <robertmaxrees> can you share a fiddle that illustrates the problem?
[09:58:58] <jakesy> var newVal = $(this).val().replace(/[^\d]/gi, ''); ?
[09:59:07] <HikaruBG> meaning i need to use .on("input", function(){}) for Firefox, and .on("keydown", function(){}) for Chrome
[09:59:15] <robertmaxrees> you can use both in one btw.
[09:59:21] <robertmaxrees> .on('input keydown', function() {});
[10:00:01] <HikaruBG> fiddle works, because it is not Firefox on Android. :) I am remote-debugging an android device here to reproduce the problem
[10:00:02] <HikaruBG> :)
[10:00:23] <robertmaxrees> lol you can do remote debugging with fiddles btw ;)
[10:00:28] <HikaruBG> Let me try the "input keydown" suggestion
[10:00:43] <robertmaxrees> that may or may not necessarily fix your problem.
[10:00:43] <HikaruBG> can I? :) didn't know that
[10:00:44] <HikaruBG> :)
[10:01:00] <robertmaxrees> and seeing your code would still be nice.
[10:01:09] <HikaruBG> yeah, I get that - but I would like to try it :)
[10:01:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:01:31] <robertmaxrees> also - what characters are you trying to prevent from getting input?
[10:02:09] <jakesy> <input type="number" isnt a viable solution?
[10:02:18] <robertmaxrees> ^ this is where i was headed with that.
[10:02:33] <robertmaxrees> with a fallback that checks on form submit or when the input in question loses focus.
[10:02:48] <robertmaxrees> otherwise people are hitting buttons and nothing is happening and then they get frustrated.
[10:03:20] <jakesy> and I think mobile browsers will only give you a numeric keyboard for input="number" fields
[10:03:42] <robertmaxrees> yep
[10:05:00] <HikaruBG> is there a console in JSFiddle?
[10:05:15] <robertmaxrees> the one for your browser.
[10:05:47] <jakesy> F12 or command-option-J
[10:06:24] <robertmaxrees> depending on your OS.
[10:15:04] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, here is the jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/44184xt1/2/
[10:15:13] <HikaruBG> Please take a look.
[10:15:24] <HikaruBG> this won't work on the android forefox
[10:15:58] <kokut> Hello, I need to add a drop down below another one after the client has selected an item in it, is there an easy way to do it?
[10:16:34] <robertmaxrees> kokut bind a listener to the change event to add the new dropdown
[10:17:30] <jakesy> it depends on how you want it to look like, you could also just have it disabled until its conditions are satisfied
[10:17:38] <robertmaxrees> ^ which is the smarter way.
[10:17:40] <robertmaxrees> was about to say that
[10:18:19] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/44184xt1/3/
[10:18:20] <kokut> i would like it to be inexistent or hidden until the user clicks on the drop down item (selects a value) then a new drop down list is created or shown, using more space, below it, with new options
[10:18:21] <robertmaxrees> try this.
[10:18:35] <robertmaxrees> kokut then hide it using display: none;
[10:18:41] <robertmaxrees> and then show it when ready.
[10:18:58] <kokut> no
[10:19:01] <kokut> that would probably take space
[10:19:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:19:15] <robertmaxrees> display: none; completely removes it from the page.
[10:19:27] <robertmaxrees> you're thinking of visibility: hidden;
[10:19:42] <kokut> but anyways i dont think i know which values it will contain, the idea is to fill it with different things depending on what the user has selected
[10:20:03] <robertmaxrees> then build out the select when the user has made their choices.
[10:20:17] <kokut> how
[10:20:38] <robertmaxrees> $('select').on('change', function() { /* build and add the new dropdown here */ });
[10:21:38] <kokut> mmh okay
[10:21:47] <kokut> im such a noob with jQuery i know almost nothing
[10:21:57] <robertmaxrees> kokut great time to learn then :)
[10:22:10] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG something seems off here but i'm not sure what - are you getting that console.log() to fire"?
[10:22:59] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, thanks - I fixed it a bit
[10:23:02] <HikaruBG> http://jsfiddle.net/44184xt1/6/
[10:23:06] <HikaruBG> look now
[10:23:25] <HikaruBG> I need to detect the keycode in android Firefox :) let me try that if it works
[10:23:30] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:23:53] <robertmaxrees> also, there's an input type="date"
[10:24:26] <robertmaxrees> though support is janky.  could pretty easily grab a polyfill for it.
[10:26:14] <HikaruBG> i get the "keypress, keydown, or input detected: undefined" on Firefox for Android console :)
[10:26:20] <HikaruBG> key variable is undefined
[10:26:51] <HikaruBG> which means e.which || e.keyCode don't return anything
[10:26:53] <HikaruBG> :)
[10:27:09] <robertmaxrees> for giggles, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/44184xt1/7/
[10:28:45] <robertmaxrees> if that still doesn't give you anything, http://www.asquare.net/javascript/tests/KeyCode.html
[10:31:07] <HikaruBG> robertmaxrees, e.which always returns 0 and e.keyCode always returns undefined
[10:31:23] <robertmaxrees> check the last page i linked you.
[10:31:25] <robertmaxrees> what happens there?
[10:33:33] <HikaruBG> Same thing. I did check it. :) e.which == 0 and e.keyCode == undefined
[10:33:41] <robertmaxrees> then there's another problem.
[10:33:45] <HikaruBG> only on Android + Firefox browser
[10:33:57] <HikaruBG> yep
[10:34:21] <robertmaxrees> if http://www.asquare.net/javascript/tests/KeyCode.html is broken, then you've got something really weird going on.
[10:37:36] <HikaruBG> :) it is broken :)
[10:37:48] <HikaruBG> but I think i know where the problem is
[10:37:52] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[10:38:22] <HikaruBG> mobile devices have the autocomplete="on" autocorrect="on" autocapitalize="on" by default
[10:38:38] <HikaruBG> and you can switch that off as input attributes
[10:38:46] <HikaruBG> but Firefox won't get it
[10:38:52] <HikaruBG> and it is wierd
[10:39:00] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting them?
[10:39:22] <HikaruBG> usually:  <input type="text" autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" />
[10:39:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[10:39:37] <HikaruBG> and it won't wait for you to chose a word from the autocomplete
[10:40:08] <rrr_> how to set text for <a>?
[10:40:12] <robertmaxrees> .text()
[10:40:16] <HikaruBG> usually Chrome fires keyCode=229 (deadKey) and waits for you to select a word from the outocomplete
[10:40:38] <HikaruBG> but if you get these attributes in the input turned off
[10:40:39] <rrr_> when document ready
[10:40:48] <HikaruBG> and chrome gets the right keycode
[10:40:49] <robertmaxrees> rrr_ ...
[10:40:58] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG i'd maybe look for a plugin that does input date validation.
[10:41:01] <HikaruBG> ONLY THE FREAKING FIREFOX WON'T
[10:41:01] <robertmaxrees> rrr_ what have you tried?
[10:41:55] <HikaruBG> all masking plugins break on Android :) I have written 2 f them in the past month and researched bunch of ready solutions
[10:42:14] <HikaruBG> I dug into it and found the problem, now I need to solve it for Firefox for Android
[10:42:15] <rrr_> robertmaxrees: I don't know how to do it by jquery
[10:42:18] <HikaruBG> wierd
[10:42:34] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery document ready
[10:42:35] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: $( document ).ready() | jQuery Learning Center → http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[10:42:58] <robertmaxrees> rrr_ ^
[10:44:24] <rrr_> $(document).ready($('#id').text('this text')) ?
[10:44:37] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:44:40] <robertmaxrees> you didn't realy the page.
[10:44:42] <robertmaxrees> *read
[10:44:58] <rrr_> $(document).ready(function(){$('#id').text('this text')})
[10:45:00] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/ the first code example here shows you how to do it.
[10:45:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:45:06] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[10:46:22] <jakesy> isnt $(document).ready(function(){ the same as $(function() {
[10:46:34] <robertmaxrees> technically the other way around, but yeah
[10:46:56] <robertmaxrees> if $() sees that you've passed it a function, it'll call it in document ready.
[10:47:45] <robertmaxrees> HikaruBG is FF on android really that important btw?
[10:49:42] <HikaruBG> Yes, I am coding for nationwide company - few millions users. just can't ignore it
[10:50:22] <robertmaxrees> don't need to ignore it.
[10:50:39] <robertmaxrees> you can provide server-side validation and kick the user back to the page when they don't do it right.
[10:50:46] <robertmaxrees> that's what we do in cases like this.
[10:53:29] <spudzee1111> I have a question about the <input> tag
[10:53:39] <robertmaxrees> just ask :)
[10:53:40] <jakesy> I may or may not have an answer
[10:53:42] <spudzee1111> kk
[10:54:32] <spudzee1111> How can I have the text that I enter be put into a var string, without having to press any buttons?
[10:54:55] <robertmaxrees> use an event listener
[10:55:05] <robertmaxrees> depending on browser support, use the input event.
[10:55:06] <spudzee1111> I want to make a pop up suggestions system for my search
[10:55:17] <jakesy> angular data bindi- I mean, what maxrees said
[10:55:18] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('input', function() { /* your code here */ });
[10:55:27] <spudzee1111> ah, okay
[10:55:36] <spudzee1111> I’ll try that, thanks
[10:56:14] <spudzee1111> what do I put instead of ‘input’ for the $(‘input’).on… ?
[10:56:31] <robertmaxrees> a selector for the tag you care about.
[10:56:46] <kokut> so, i have my list ready, i gave it id=list1, i need that when the user selects an element in the list an new list is created below it
[10:57:12] <robertmaxrees> kokut bind an event listener to the list for the 'change' event.
[10:57:22] <robertmaxrees> $('#list1').on('change', function() {});
[10:57:25] <kokut> so far it looks like $('#list1').on('change', function() { //function });
[10:57:30] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[10:57:35] <kokut> so thats all?
[10:57:41] <robertmaxrees> that's the first part.
[10:57:45] <kokut> and then
[10:57:54] <kokut> man im almost completely new to jquery
[10:58:03] <robertmaxrees> we'll point you in the right direction :D
[10:58:19] <kokut> yes plz
[10:58:33] <jakesy> invest in enron
[10:58:58] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to create elements - you can pass an HTML string to $() and that'll create a node for you.
[10:59:09] <robertmaxrees> and then you can use .append() to place it whereever you want.
[10:59:22] <spudzee1111> So if my input tag is the following: ‘First name: <input type="text" name="fname" id=“search”><br>’ would I have,”$(‘search’).on('input', function() { /* your code here */ });” or “$(‘fname’).on('input', function() { /* your code here */ });” or would it be something else?
[10:59:34] <robertmaxrees> #search
[10:59:43] <jakesy> like css
[10:59:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:59:55] <kokut> robert
[10:59:59] <robertmaxrees> kokut ?
[11:00:20] <kokut> what do you mean with pass an html string to $()
[11:00:36] <kokut> just gimme something i can test
[11:00:36] <spudzee1111> The example was taken from w3school; do the “First name” and “name=‘fname’” have any purpose?
[11:00:36] <jakesy> document.createElement("div") == $("<div>")
[11:00:39] <systemfault> kokut: It creates a DOM fragment
[11:00:40] <robertmaxrees> $('<div>this is some html</div>')
[11:00:50] <robertmaxrees> jakesy those aren't the same thing.
[11:00:57] <robertmaxrees> similar ish, but there are some distinctions.
[11:00:58] <kokut> and how do i append that
[11:01:04] <jakesy> $(document.createElement("div")) == $("<div>") ?
[11:01:18] <robertmaxrees> $('#theTarget').append(theNewElement.)
[11:01:24] <robertmaxrees> kokut try googling around and learning :)
[11:01:33] <rrr_> robertmaxrees: it does not work
[11:01:44] <robertmaxrees> rrr_ what doesn't?
[11:02:21] <rrr_> robertmaxrees: the code does not get called
[11:02:26] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ rrr_
[11:02:26] <b-ot> rrr_: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[11:02:38] <kokut> theNewElement is a variable that holds what?
[11:02:43] <jakesy> I think hes referring to the "  $(document).ready(function(){$('#id').text('this text')})"
[11:02:44] <robertmaxrees> the element you created.
[11:02:51] <kokut> where did you store the data
[11:03:11] <robertmaxrees> var $myNewElement = $('<div>try googling for answers</div');
[11:03:16] <robertmaxrees> var $myNewElement = $('<div>try googling for answers</div>');
[11:03:46] <kokut> ok
[11:04:08] <robertmaxrees> jakesy i need to see more of their code to see what the problem might be.
[11:04:15] <kokut> lets see if it works :D
[11:04:19] <robertmaxrees> i can't divine cases of "doesn't work"
[11:04:26] <robertmaxrees> kokut if you need more, make a fiddle :)
[11:04:43] <jakesy> $.get('/answers', { id: '555' }, function(data){ console.log(data); });
[11:05:10] <kokut> ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[11:05:17] <jakesy> lol
[11:05:21] <robertmaxrees> is your code before or after jquery?
[11:05:23] <kokut> should i add a $(document).ready() or something
[11:05:30] <ronswan> Are there any cases where event delegation is slower than directly binding events?  Why isn't everything delegated from the body tag?
[11:05:33] <robertmaxrees> you need to put your code after the jquery include.
[11:05:51] <robertmaxrees> ronswan you end up filtering every event to see if it matches the given selector.
[11:06:12] <robertmaxrees> ronswan there's a slight performance overhead for each event emitted, instead of the overhead of the initial binds and storage costs.
[11:06:16] <ronswan> Doesn't it climb the dom tree anyway?
[11:06:18] <kokut> jquery is at the end of the HTML
[11:06:25] <robertmaxrees> kokut your code needs to come after jquery.
[11:06:38] <robertmaxrees> ronswan the actual speed difference is so minimal that it doesn't matter.
[11:06:43] <robertmaxrees> and jquery events are not DOM events :)
[11:06:50] <kokut> i thought i could include jquery just before closing html
[11:07:05] <robertmaxrees> kokut sure, and any code that relies on it needs to be after it.
[11:07:25] <kokut> oh i get it
[11:07:36] <ronswan> robertmaxrees: interesting thanks !!
[11:08:01] <kokut> it worked :D
[11:08:05] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[11:09:00] <kokut> Now i need to make it work as i need it, its adding new elements every time the client clicks on an item from the list, i need it to clear all the created elements and add the new one i guess
[11:09:37] <kokut> k i will try to work on it, thank you very much robertmaxrees
[11:09:49] <jakesy> $('#list2').empty()
[11:09:58] <robertmaxrees> or .replace()
[11:10:02] <robertmaxrees> or .html()
[11:11:01] <jakesy> will .html accept a jquery node? e.g. .html($('p:last-child'))
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> i want to think it does.
[11:12:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a3Lbrjpt/
[11:12:22] <robertmaxrees> yep, it'll take a jquery object.
[11:13:52] <jakesy> http://jsfiddle.net/44184xt1/14/
[11:16:45] <jakesy> oops. Unless nested <p> is bad anywayhttp://jsfiddle.net/44184xt1/16/
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> yeah nested <p> tags are no bueno iirc.
[11:18:09] <jakesy> although this is interesting http://jsfiddle.net/44184xt1/17/
[11:18:22] <systemfault> It's not just bad, it's invalid.
[11:18:24] <robertmaxrees> interesting how?
[11:18:56] <jakesy> oh, I guess it's not
[11:19:18] <jakesy> it probably does the second one as a chunk, and then clobbers teh functionality by stripping it of the third and appending it
[11:20:11] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/g5x6iIo.png
[11:20:16] <robertmaxrees> it does exactly what you told it to.
[11:20:27] <robertmaxrees> you're moving the divs as three separate elements.
[11:20:44] <spudzee1111> okay, so I have this: http://jsfiddle.net/p81k3vo2/
[11:21:16] <robertmaxrees> you want placeholder text.
[11:21:41] <spudzee1111> I want, when I click #searchbar1, for me to be able to type into the that searchbar
[11:21:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/p81k3vo2/
[11:21:59] <jakesy> robert is psychic
[11:22:13] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/style-placeholder-text/ to style it.
[11:23:44] <spudzee1111> But you do see the issue with the program, right?
[11:23:56] <robertmaxrees> yes - you're doing it wrong ;)
[11:23:58] <spudzee1111> When I click it and type, nothing happens
[11:24:09] <robertmaxrees> right, you're clicking on a P tag.
[11:24:41] <spudzee1111> So… how do I not do that?
[11:24:48] <robertmaxrees> use placeholder text instead.
[11:24:52] <robertmaxrees> like i just showed you.
[11:24:58] <spudzee1111> ohhhh
[11:25:00] <spudzee1111> that’s what that as
[11:25:03] <spudzee1111> was*
[11:26:24] <spudzee1111> yeah, so if I take #searchtext away it works.
[11:29:14] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:29:45] <spudzee1111> How do I implement the placeholder text css? doing this: http://jsfiddle.net/p81k3vo2/3/ obviously doesn’t work.
[11:29:57] <jakesy> http://jsfiddle.net/p81k3vo2/4/
[11:29:57] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[11:30:01] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[11:30:05] <robertmaxrees> you implement it in markup.
[11:30:47] <spudzee1111> jakesy put it in css...
[11:31:04] <jakesy> he said you cant define the placeholder in css
[11:31:08] <spudzee1111> jakesy, thanks, that actually works perfectly
[11:31:12] <jakesy> you can style it, but implement = define
[11:31:47] <spudzee1111> oh, I just now noticed you put a “placeholder=‘Search’” in the input tag.
[11:31:58] <spudzee1111> okay, this makes sense now
[11:31:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:32:53] <spudzee1111> thanks for the help, everyone.
[11:33:04] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[11:34:16] <jakesy> im not sure how to use the placeholder pseudoselector in conjunction with the :focus pseudoselector to make the placeholder go away on focus instead of type
[11:34:32] <robertmaxrees> :focuse :placeholder iirc
[11:34:37] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter much
[11:35:05] <jakesy> you're right :focus::-webkit-input-placeholder works
[11:35:48] <jakesy> http://jsfiddle.net/p81k3vo2/5/ I find it looks a little nicer
[11:37:36] <robertmaxrees> when on webkit
[11:37:52] <jakesy> what browser do you main?
[11:38:20] <robertmaxrees> FF dev edition.
[11:38:27] <robertmaxrees> probably one of like 4 people in the world.
[11:38:32] <systemfault> Hehe
[11:38:35] <robertmaxrees> and some IE.
[11:39:19] <samssh> I'm running FF dev edition at work. I do actual dev in it, with everything else in stable FF.
[11:42:33] <systemfault> Is FF dev ed. still firefox alpha with a black theme?
[11:42:46] <systemfault> Like... it has nothing special over "normal" firefox
[11:43:15] <robertmaxrees> it's had some extra tools from the beginning, but that's basically it.
[11:45:32] <jakesy> does the current dev edition spawn threads for each tabS? I had heard they were looking in to doing that
[11:45:51] <systemfault> I don't know but e10s is indeed a thing
[11:45:53] <robertmaxrees> dev is beta channel iirc.  alpha channel you can enable that.
[11:47:29] <robertmaxrees> https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis yep
[11:47:55] <Es0teric> i have a quick question — on this: $('.single-article').find('p').filter( function() { return $(this).text().length === 0; }).remove(); how do i make it so that it doesnt remove a <p> tag that has html but only <p> tags that are empty
[11:47:57] <Es0teric> ?
[11:48:51] <robertmaxrees> $(this).text().length === 0 || $(this).find('*').length === 0;
[11:48:54] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[11:54:13] <spudzee1111> I have another question about the input tag. How do I make it where, if you click away from the search bar, it will replace the text you inputed with the original placeholder text?
[11:54:37] <robertmaxrees> bind to the blur event and set the .val() to ''
[11:54:54] <robertmaxrees> $('input').on('blur', function() { $(this).val(''); });
[11:55:04] <spudzee1111> oh
[11:55:29] <robertmaxrees> since the placeholder shows when there's no text.
[11:55:33] <spudzee1111> right
[11:55:36] <spudzee1111> that’s cool
[11:55:48] <decx> that seems highly irritating
[11:55:57] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[11:56:09] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i wouldn't clear out the input in the first place.
[11:56:12] <robertmaxrees> buuut...
[11:56:22] <decx> my grandman always misses the submit button
[11:56:23] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i tried that but its still hiding <p> tags that have html in them
[11:56:24] <spudzee1111> I was just playing around with ideas
[11:56:26] <decx> -n
[11:56:43] <robertmaxrees> spudzee1111 don't remove the text in the first place imo
[11:56:49] <spudzee1111> yeah
[11:56:52] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric a fiddle would be helpful.
[11:56:53] <spudzee1111> I probably won’t use it
[11:57:19] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: this is basic logic at this point man…
[11:57:29] <robertmaxrees> oh ok.
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> then it should be easy.
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> enjoy!
[11:57:37] <spudzee1111> what if I want something else to trigger that, like clicking a separate button, robert?
[11:57:46] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:57:51] <robertmaxrees> !api on
[11:57:51] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:58:05] <Es0teric> i mean i have a bunch of <p> tags and i want to hide the ones that dont have html or text in them
[11:58:17] <robertmaxrees> yep - basic logic!  go ahead!
[11:58:18] <spudzee1111> But you can’t say, : $('input').on(‘click’, function() { $(this).val(''); });
[11:58:41] <Es0teric> see this is exactly why i dislike js
[11:58:44] <robertmaxrees> spudzee1111 right - so you'd select the input you want to clear.
[11:58:46] <spudzee1111> oh crap
[11:59:02] <spudzee1111> yeah, I can see how that was a stupid question, now.
[11:59:07] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:59:09] <spudzee1111> sorry
[12:01:26] <robertmaxrees> back
[12:01:38] <robertmaxrees> spudzee1111 nah, not stupid, just need to think things through a little :D
[12:01:40] <robertmaxrees> nbd
[12:01:48] <spudzee1111> okay
[12:02:37] <spudzee1111> I wish there was a programming language that used ‘.’ as an end mark instead of ‘;’ because it would be more natural to us. Like ending a sentence with a period.
[12:04:25] <robertMeeting> i'm just so used to using semicolons now to end statements.
[12:04:30] <robertMeeting> and linters to yell at me.
[12:05:51] <Velveeta_> yeah i'm used to semicolons for line endings.. if i were to start using periods, i would expect to see something dereferenced off the end of them :D
[12:05:57] <Es0teric> spudzee1111: or you can use python or ruby.. semi-colons dont matter
[12:06:09] <_DB> hey guys i need some help

[12:06:23] <spudzee1111> The only part of brain that enjoys python is my artistic side.
[12:06:36] <Velveeta_> that doesn't sound like a jquery question...
[12:06:38] <spudzee1111> It does look very pretty
[12:10:19] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/4u9Lqqoe/
[12:10:24] <_DB> that script has a listener for when I click a radio button when clicked it changes the types of data it is searching for
[12:10:30] <_DB> how can I make it so it searches for a particular kind instead?
[12:10:50] <_DB> I want to remove the radio buttons and just have one option no buttons
[12:12:03] <Velveeta_> there's no jquery in that script...
[12:12:22] <Velveeta_> are you looking to incorporate it, or find a way to do that without it?
[12:12:52] <_DB> to do it without it
[12:12:59] <_DB> I was told I could put a hidden input
[12:13:08] <_DB> with the same name as the radio buttons and value
[12:13:13] <_DB> and it should work but I doubt it
[12:13:32] <_DB> considering the code has a radio button listener
[12:13:34] <Velveeta_> that may be... but this is a jquery support channel...
[12:13:59] <_DB> theres no jquery on it?
[12:14:11] <_DB> lol wasnt aware it was all javascript
[12:14:35] <robertMeeting> you'll probably get more help in ##javascript, _DB

[12:34:29] <[Non]> sometimes when you click 3rd or first item on this, it sets width: 1094% for a second
[12:34:31] <[Non]> :/
[12:35:26] <Robdgreat> D:
[12:37:51] <jakesy> welp that doesnt look good in the demo view lol
[12:38:02] <_DB> it seems the Google map Api im using
[12:38:03] <_DB> doesnt let me grab auto complete data unless the map is showing
[12:38:16] <_DB> currently im hiding it to get the data I need :/
[12:39:15] <amore123> is there any way to not cache __just a part__ of a website, por example a shopping cart (the typical on the right side of the page) ?
[12:41:14] <zkv> Hello
[12:41:42] <NoiseEee> amore123: no but why would that be cached anyways?  isn't the backend making a request to see whats in the cart?
[12:42:16] <[Non]> http://plnkr.co/edit/fULbjxvWZVWSFyfjyfix?p=preview
[12:42:20] <[Non]> could anyone help me out?
[12:42:28] <[Non]> slider isn't work proper.
[12:43:06] <amore123> NoiseEee, sorry, I dont understand exactly your questions, could your explain better for a newbie?
[12:43:09] <zkv> When i want an event to trigger over .menu > li i make $('.menu > li).click(function(){...;}); but when i want an event to trigger if not '.menu > li' is pressed what selector should i use in this case?
[12:45:11] <Mastema> is there any sure way to detect wether someone is using a mobile device or not?
[12:47:18] <robertMeeting> Mastema depends on why you care if they're on a mobile device :)
[12:48:13] <Mastema> robertMetting: So I can know whether they'll be doing gesture hand type zooming in and out or not
[12:48:38] <robertMeeting> check to see if the device supports touch, the useragent, and screen size.
[12:48:41] <robertMeeting> tons of ways.
[13:04:20] <zkv> http://jsfiddle.net/57rp14uy/ Can it be done less ugly?
[13:09:28] <spudzee1111> zkv: you need to add html and css elements to that, and also specify which version of jquery you’re using (left side of the page)
[13:10:12] <zkv> spudzee1111, here is it http://jsfiddle.net/57rp14uy/1/
[13:10:47] <spudzee1111> you should add some css if you’re concerned about looks
[13:11:35] <zkv> spudzee1111, i think that written javascript code looks bad.. is it ok? or can this code can be written some another better way?
[13:11:44] <spudzee1111> oh
[13:11:51] <spudzee1111> you’re concerned about the look of the code itself
[13:12:36] <spudzee1111> what about the code looks visually displeasing to you?
[13:13:22] <zkv> spudzee1111, yeah.. i will add css to style it but i am not very familiar with jquery and javascript so i do not understand is this code is ok or is it can be written better and to be more readable by other people :)
[13:13:42] <spudzee1111> Looks fine to me
[13:14:44] <zkv> spudzee1111, when the first event is fired i add value to the variable and when the second event is fired i check that value and if it is not set i add another code. it looks like this way of passing argument to another event listener is not very good idea. but i do not understand can it be passed there another way
[13:18:11] <spudzee1111> I’d use a boolean for that, but really it’s just personal preference. Also, I was gonna say your if statement doesn’t look right, but it works, so it’s fine.
[13:19:14] <zkv> spudzee1111, thank you for your help )
[13:21:06] <_DB> oi
[13:21:11] <_DB> what markup is this {{#if dataTypeHTML}}
[13:21:18] <jakesy> handlebars ?
[13:21:40] <_DB> what does that mean?
[13:21:50] <jakesy> http://handlebarsjs.com/
[13:21:51] <_DB> I got it from this https://github.com/stephjang/placecomplete
[13:21:55] <jakesy> well mustache probably
[13:22:20] <jakesy> https://mustache.github.io/#demo
[13:23:49] <samssh> _DB, It's handlebars. The <script> tag the code is in hints it.
[13:24:12] <_DB> so wth am I supposed to do with it
[13:24:15] <_DB> lol
[13:24:28] <jakesy> live on...
[13:24:32] <jakesy>  *dies*
[13:24:34] <samssh> Learn handlebars? Whatever you want.
[13:24:45] <_DB> uhh I dont have time for that
[13:24:54] <_DB> I already use a MVC that uses blade
[13:25:04] <samssh> Then don't use it.
[13:25:25] <jakesy> im certain that learning handlebars takes less time that replacing the uses of it in your code
[13:27:06] <_DB> well I dont need it in my code
[13:27:14] <_DB> im more worried on grabbing the returns
[13:37:21] <Velveeta> "i need somebody else to provide me code to do what i don't want to write myself" "what is this technology in their code that i don't recognize?" "well what the hell am i supposed to do with that?"
[13:37:38] <wheeei^^> do jQuery have special jQuery objects? whats the purpose of writing $someElement = ........ I take it, it's not a normal variable...
[13:38:15] <jakesy> because $element.val() and element.value
[13:38:38] <Velveeta> wheeei^^: you can name a variable whatever you want, and it's sole naming purpose is to clue devs in to what type of data it might store... the $ doesn't make it any kind of special variable type, but clues in other devs that it's most likely a jquery instance
[13:38:39] <jakesy> its just a naming convention to help you discern how to interact with the object
[13:39:10] <wheeei^^> oh okay thanx!
[13:39:44] <_d4rklit3> hi
[13:39:51] <_d4rklit3> can some1 recommend a good accordion plugin
[13:39:54] <_d4rklit3> one that goes vertical
[13:40:09] <wheeei^^> Velveeta seems like a good best practice I should start with :)
[13:40:34] <Velveeta> _d4rklit3: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[13:40:51] <_d4rklit3> not quite what i want
[13:41:10] <Velveeta> wheeei^^: i typically only use it myself when creating a $this variable representation of $(this), but it's definitely intuitive to most jquery devs when they see a $ on a variable name like that
[13:41:21] <_d4rklit3> i guess i can skinn it hoever
[13:43:40] <TrentonDAdams> Good day.  I'm having an issue with the datepicker.  I have beforeShowDay and onChangeMonthYear handling.  The functions I've provided return appropriate dates.  But, I'm having an issue where I go a month or two ahead, click elsewhere (hiding the calendar), click it again, and the current month shows the days for the previous month I was viewing.  How do I fix that?
[13:44:39] <Velveeta> are you saying that if you open a datepicker on february, and change it to april, click away, and reopen it, it's still showing april instead of the current month of february?
[13:44:50] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: precisely
[13:45:03] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Oh, slightly more than that
[13:45:04] <Velveeta> i'm not *positive*, but i believe that's expected behavior
[13:45:20] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: It's showing February, but it's showing the days that are for april
[13:45:29] <Velveeta> oh, now that's a weird one
[13:45:47] <TrentonDAdams> Yeah, that's what I thought.  The javascript console doesn't really show anything.
[13:45:58] <Velveeta> can you recreate that issue in a jsfiddle or something?
[13:46:01] <TrentonDAdams> I log all my stuff, so I know it's not being called on the repopup.
[13:46:07] <Velveeta> or have a live demo we can see?
[13:46:59] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Let me see about that.  I am using a web service that returns dates, so I'll have to hand code some days, which shouldn't take long.  I can just do 1st for feb, 2nd for march, and 3rd for april.
[13:47:14] <Velveeta> sounds good
[13:57:37] <ericP> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#jqXHR says that ajax({success: ..., error: ...}) is obselete in favor of ajax().done(...).fail(...)
[13:57:52] <sacho_> yes it does
[13:58:09] <jakesy> chaining is great
[13:58:41] <ericP> i've been providing an ajax interface to a query protocol and using $.extend to give callers the ability to override success, fail
[13:58:44] <sacho_> you can't chain .done or .fail, they all add callbacks to the same promise
[13:59:04] * sacho_ personally thinks they should deprecate them in favor of .then()
[13:59:49] <jakesy> bluebird promisify?
[13:59:51] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: I'm at a loss how to get anything working on jsfiddle.  Even the simplest thing doesn't seem to work.  e.g. http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/
[14:00:15] <ericP> e.g. query: function(callerParms) { $.ajax($.extend(defaultParms, callerParms)); }
[14:00:54] <ericP> i guess i have to stop doing that, but now i'm trying to figure out how to e.g. let a caller override my error handler.
[14:00:59] <kokut> Hello, how can i clear all children following the n children?
[14:01:22] <Velveeta> trentondadams: ahh, you're including jquery, but not jquery ui, and also aren't using a document ready wrapper, let me see if i can at least get it into a workable state for you to pick up from
[14:01:27] <[Non]> http://plnkr.co/edit/fULbjxvWZVWSFyfjyfix?p=preview
[14:01:39] <[Non]> maybe somebody help me with that. if you click some slider item you will se what the problem is..
[14:01:53] <[Non]> jquery sometimes give one item to width:1094% its meaningless
[14:01:53] <kokut> mmh i dont know if that was clear but i have a parent with many children and i want to remove all children except the first one and append a new one
[14:02:34] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: lol, it's been 1.5 years since I did the initial setup, oops
[14:02:48] <jakesy> 1.5 years ago I was a toddler
[14:03:07] <TrentonDAdams> jakesy: nice, you potty trained?
[14:03:08] <TrentonDAdams> :D
[14:03:38] <jakesy> no, but I have managed to master Angular
[14:03:42] <jakesy> its just *that* easy
[14:04:08] <TrentonDAdams> Oooh, no man, you're supposed to sit flat when you do that, not at an angle
[14:04:21] <TrentonDAdams> I crack myself up
[14:04:30] <jakesy>  /r/dadjokes
[14:04:35] <sacho_> ericP, easily
[14:04:56] <TrentonDAdams> jakesy: pretty much
[14:04:59] <sacho_> ericP, .done(options.success).fail(options.error)
[14:05:17] <[Non]> someone pls help me?
[14:05:27] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Did you fork?
[14:05:51] <ericP> sacho_, yeah, sorry, i meant if i try to provide the same interface
[14:06:18] <kokut> Please anyone can help me out a lil bit? its extremely easy
[14:06:25] <sacho_> ericP, that would be the same interface..
[14:06:34] <Velveeta> trentondadams: nope, didn't fork, just working with this version
[14:06:34] <ericP> e.g. myQueryDingus({a:b}).done(clientHappy).fail(clientSad)
[14:06:42] <ericP> (sacho_)
[14:07:03] <kokut> I just need to append a child after the client selects an option of a list, but if the client selects a new option, i need to reload the second list with different data
[14:07:20] <sacho_> ericP, yes?
[14:07:28] <jakesy> still stuck kokut? post some code
[14:07:52] <kokut> but i dont have the array that loads the data
[14:08:16] <jakesy> well post what you got and simulate the rest
[14:08:21] <kokut> let me try
[14:08:45] <ericP> sacho_, when would i execute the query? it seems like if the client doesn't call a .fail method then i never know that they're done setting parms.
[14:09:00] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Okay, I forked just in case.  You should save again.
[14:09:17] <Tawre> what would be the right way to accomodate tablets, phones and similar?
[14:09:19] <sacho_> ericP, how does a client execute a query now
[14:09:22] <Tawre> check for resolution size and place stuff based on that?
[14:09:31] <Velveeta> there's no need to fork, if you save another copy, it just increments a counter in the url, so every save is unique and nobody overwrites anybody else
[14:09:37] <NoiseEee> Tawre: google "responsive design"
[14:09:45] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Oh, good to know.
[14:09:47] <NoiseEee> Tawre: short answer: media queries
[14:09:49] <Tawre> that word has absolutely no value
[14:09:54] <Tawre> phrase*
[14:10:03] <NoiseEee> Tawre: thats why i asked you to google it
[14:10:09] <NoiseEee> Tawre: you know, so you can LEARN what it means
[14:10:11] <ericP> sacho_, it calls $.ajax with an extend of my default parms and the client's parms.
[14:10:12] <Tawre> yes and i'll get absolutely nothing relevant
[14:10:19] <Tawre> because i already know what that means and i know about media queries
[14:10:27] <Tawre> but i'm not going to design a page to fit every single type of resolution
[14:10:39] <NoiseEee> then you're misunderstanding everything Tawre
[14:10:46] <NoiseEee> because your question "Tawre: what would be the right way to accomodate tablets, phones and similar?"  has one answer
[14:10:47] <Tawre> the question isn't how to do it but rather should i differentiate between a phone's tiny screen and a desktops large screen
[14:10:57] <NoiseEee> no you should not
[14:11:05] <sacho_> ericP, who's it
[14:11:19] <Tawre> yes and that question is about how to accomodate them based on their sizes
[14:11:29] <Tawre> not the technical way of impleme- nevermind
[14:11:32] <NoiseEee> and the answer is media queries dude
[14:11:39] <ericP> sacho_, in fact, i don't know how i know with $.ajax({ GET foo }).fail(meSad) that the ajax query won't complete before it's interpreted the trailing .fail() call
[14:11:58] <ericP> sacho_, it's on 3rd
[14:12:16] <sacho_> Tawre, the technical way to differentiate between them is media queries. The way to create designs that accomodate for multiple screen sizes is called "responsive design". What is your question?
[14:12:23] <ericP> sacho_, EDIT: my query dingus calls $.ajax with an extend of my default parms and the client's parms.
[14:12:48] <sacho_> okay, so have your function call $.ajax().done().fail() now.
[14:13:25] <Velveeta> trentondadams: ok, here's a minimum viable demo you can tweak to try to recreate your issue: http://jsfiddle.net/vse6xj64/2/
[14:14:23] <spudzee1111> http://jsfiddle.net/cL9wm52a/
[14:14:34] <spudzee1111> y it no work
[14:14:39] <spudzee1111> urghh
[14:15:04] <spudzee1111> (I’m trying to make where if you hover over the apple it will unblur)
[14:15:52] <kokut> http://jsfiddle.net/xp46qoqu/ Instead of displaying that red text i need to append a new list (preferably with values fetched from the server) and replace it if its already there (i.e. the user selects another option in the first list)
[14:16:10] <kokut> please i know its simple
[14:16:56] <ericP> sacho_, sure, if the client calls queryDingus.execute(query), i can return { var done=myDone, fail=myFail; $ajax().done(done).fail(fail); return this; }, but if they don't call this.done(somethingElse) before the query returns, my code won't call their callback
[14:17:04] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: I don't get why it's working.  I had the anonymous wrapper originally, but just kept getting the undefined error.
[14:17:04] <ericP> sacho_, it looks like a race condition
[14:17:29] <sacho_> ...what?
[14:17:33] <sacho_> please provide some sample code
[14:18:11] <ericP> sacho_, (albeit rare, given that one thread is setting up a socket while the other is finishing executing "...done(clientDone).fail(clientFail")
[14:18:17] <sacho_> if you currently have a function that calls $.ajax(options), then it's trivial to modify it to do $.ajax(options-without-success-error).done(success).fail(error)
[14:19:06] <kokut> jakesy: http://jsfiddle.net/xp46qoqu/
[14:19:07] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: just do it with a css transition, no need to javascript that up
[14:19:28] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: http://jsfiddle.net/cL9wm52a/1/
[14:19:53] <Velveeta> trentondadams: it wasn't including jquery ui originally, only jquery, i added jquery ui to the external resources list
[14:20:04] <spudzee1111> Velveeta, I love your mac and cheese
[14:20:10] * Velveeta tips his hat.
[14:20:32] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/ueTbyb5.gif
[14:20:41] <spudzee1111> Anyhow, what if I want it to blur in the instance of a different div being hovered over?
[14:20:47] <ericP> sacho_, ignoring my code for a moment, if i do [[ var a = $.ajax(...); sleep(100); a.done(myCallback); ]], chances are that the network action will finish before that codeblock calls a.done(), right?
[14:21:07] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: then don't make that css id-specific, make it class-specific, and add that class to the target that you want to blur
[14:21:09] <spudzee1111> or… unblur in this case
[14:21:28] <ericP> sacho_, so what if we turn that sleep down to 0, isn't it still a race condition?
[14:21:41] <sacho_> there's no sleep in javascript
[14:21:48] <sacho_> so let's not ignore your code
[14:21:50] <spudzee1111> That sounds horrifyingly complicated to do :(
[14:21:51] <ericP> ok, count to a zillion
[14:22:08] <sacho_> no.
[14:22:31] <spudzee1111> I’m not good at css; is there no way to just use jquery somehow?
[14:22:32] <sacho_> you can't resolve events while javascript is still running.
[14:22:43] <sacho_> you need to resolve an event to get the response from an xhr.
[14:22:57] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: it's simple in css, and less overhead on the browser to do so: http://jsfiddle.net/cL9wm52a/2/
[14:23:16] <Velveeta> took me all of 1 minute to split that out into a class and apply it to new elements in the demo
[14:23:38] <Velveeta> just because you're not good at something doesn't mean you shouldn't take the time to learn it if it's the right tool for the job
[14:23:44] <ericP> sacho_, ahh, so $.ajax(...) can't immediately spawn another thread?
[14:23:58] <sacho_> it can. It's irrelevant.
[14:24:32] <ericP> how do we know that thread one has parsed .done(foo) before thread 2 has executed the network GET?
[14:24:36] <jakesy> kokut: http://jsfiddle.net/xp46qoqu/1/
[14:24:38] <Velveeta> ericp: don't think of it in terms of threads though, when it hits an ajax request, it kicks it off and then just ignores it and checks back from time to time to see if it's complete
[14:24:46] <sacho_> ericP, because of what I just told you.
[14:24:53] <Velveeta> it continues on in the same thread and polls that request to see when it completes
[14:24:57] <sacho_> ericP, the browser communicates xhr response by queueing an event.
[14:25:00] <kokut> jakesy: its not what i need man
[14:25:04] <sacho_> ericP, you can't consume an event while there's still javascript running.
[14:25:07] <jakesy> what do you need?
[14:25:07] <jfive> hello
[14:25:15] <spudzee1111> Velveeta, I don’t think you understand what I’m asking. Is there a way for, when you hover over the text divs, that it unblurs the image?
[14:25:17] <sacho_> ericP, your function must finish running before any events are handled
[14:25:34] <kokut> jakesy:  http://jsfiddle.net/xp46qoqu/ Instead of displaying that red text i need to append a new list (preferably with values fetched from the server) and replace it if its already there (i.e. the user selects another option in the first list)
[14:25:35] <ericP> sacho_, got it now.
[14:25:55] <ericP> as Velveeta said, don't think of threads [think of queues]
[14:26:54] <ericP> sacho_, Velveeta, thanks much. changed my model.
[14:27:12] <spudzee1111> I’m pretty sure I know what css can and can’t do. And I’ve tried use css to make divs affect other divs in the past, to no avail.
[14:27:27] <jfive> i am using this datepicker() plugin at http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html and i was wondering if anyone can help me... some of the text inputs are set to disabled="disabled" and for those the datepicker() isn't binding. any way around this? (there are checkboxes to enable/disable each text input)
[14:27:53] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: well yeah, for that, you want javascript... but this isn't an example of that, this is an example of a simple mouseover/mouseout, which can easily be handled in css
[14:28:15] <spudzee1111> But that’s not the case for my actual issue.
[14:28:31] <spudzee1111> For my actual issue there is a div above my image
[14:28:55] <Velveeta> and when you mouseover that div, you want the image to unblur?
[14:29:02] <spudzee1111> yes
[14:29:11] <Velveeta> so physically in the dom, the div precedes the img right?
[14:29:18] <TrentonDAdams> Velveeta: Oh, shit, didn't know you could add stuff there. I should use this more often, just for being familiar if nothing else.
[14:29:21] <spudzee1111> yes
[14:29:31] <jakesy> kokut: http://jsfiddle.net/xp46qoqu/2/
[14:30:01] <kokut> jakesy: not what i need
[14:30:05] <kokut> jakesy: i need a whole new llist
[14:30:20] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/cL9wm52a/3/
[14:30:25] <jakesy> how is that not a new list
[14:30:36] <spudzee1111> How the heck
[14:30:39] <spudzee1111> wow
[14:30:44] <_DB> http://laravel.io/bin/LkyEG
[14:30:46] <_DB> how can I export that to a external js file?
[14:30:46] <spudzee1111> I am genuinly impressed with that
[14:30:48] <_DB> (dont kill meh please)
[14:31:00] <Velveeta> :D
[14:31:13] <Velveeta> the plus sign tells it to match against the next sibling
[14:31:31] <Velveeta> so .unblur-next + img means any image immediately following an element with class "unblur-me"
[14:31:31] <spudzee1111> hmm
[14:31:35] <Velveeta> er "unblur-next"
[14:32:16] <spudzee1111> question
[14:32:24] <jakesy> cheese
[14:32:25] <Velveeta> trentondadams: yepyep :)
[14:32:31] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: go for it
[14:32:32] <pawn> What's the diff between 1.7 and 2.x?
[14:32:33] <spudzee1111> does it have to be next in the html or css
[14:32:35] <Velveeta> jakesy: yassir?
[14:32:43] <jfive> jakesy: <div><li></li></div> is not valid markup, of course
[14:32:47] <Velveeta> spudezee1111: it has to be the next element physically in the dom
[14:32:53] <pawn> I'm trying to use Camera (http://www.pixedelic.com/plugins/camera/) but I'm using 2.x version of jquery.
[14:32:56] <spudzee1111> I don’t understand
[14:32:57] <Velveeta> in the markup itself
[14:33:00] <Velveeta> in the html
[14:33:02] <spudzee1111> right
[14:33:06] <spudzee1111> my case isn't
[14:33:09] <pawn> Is 2.x not backwards compatible?
[14:33:11] <spudzee1111> (I’m sorry)
[14:33:14] <Velveeta> but i specifically asked that and you said yes :D
[14:33:18] <jakesy> jfive: thank you
[14:33:23] <spudzee1111> I didn’t realize the question
[14:33:27] <spudzee1111> I’m sorry
[14:33:35] <Velveeta> ok, so how is your markup actually laid out in the dom?
[14:33:45] <Velveeta> can you alter that jsfiddle to show it?
[14:33:46] <spudzee1111> maybe I can pull something, hold on
[14:34:09] <NoiseEee> pawn: not really
[14:34:28] <pawn> NoiseEee: But a plugin using 1.7 should work on 1.9?
[14:34:39] <NoiseEee> pawn: iirc yes
[14:34:43] <Velveeta> in theory, yes
[14:35:02] <pawn> NoiseEee: I'm using the version of jquery in the jquery npm package. How do I install 1.9 instead of 2.x from npm?
[14:35:06] <Velveeta> 2.x strips out a lot of legacy browser support functionality, so plugins written for 1.x may not work, or may not work on legacy browsers, in 2.x
[14:35:26] <NoiseEee> pawn: why npm at all?
[14:35:33] <NoiseEee> pawn: just download an older version of jquery?
[14:35:43] <pawn> NoiseEee: Because that's what I like to use (CommonJS)
[14:36:01] <NoiseEee> well can't you specify the jquery version in your package.json?
[14:36:06] <Velveeta> yep
[14:36:08] <pawn> I like to use jquery by requiring from within my code vs having a global jQuery object
[14:36:35] <spudzee1111> ah haa
[14:36:42] <spudzee1111> I made it work
[14:36:44] <Velveeta> spudzee1111: did you figure it out?
[14:36:45] <Velveeta> nice
[14:36:54] <spudzee1111> yssss...
[14:36:59] <Velveeta> aww yiss
[14:37:11] <spudzee1111> that beautiful unblur is beautiful
[14:37:41] <Velveeta> $('#spudzee1111 > code').beautify()
[14:37:46] <tejas-manohar> way to print all href of links on page?
[14:37:51] <tejas-manohar> <a href="...">
[14:37:55] <tejas-manohar> print all the ...'s across a page
[14:38:10] <Velveeta> ok, on that note, i'm outta here, adios!
[14:38:49] <pawn> NoiseEee_: Maybe.
[14:38:54] <tejas-manohar> like i wanna get all <a> tags as an array
[14:38:58] <tejas-manohar> or all <a> DOM objects
[14:39:04] <spudzee1111> velveeta!
[14:39:15] <spudzee1111> I have a one last question
[14:39:21] <spudzee1111> if you’re still there
[14:39:36] <spudzee1111> I guess he’s not
[14:40:09] <jakesy> $('a').each(function(i, a){ console.log(a.href) });
[14:43:16] <kokut> jakesy: i already made it
[14:43:30] <tejas-manohar> https://gist.github.com/tejasmanohar/5c29abee1ad97853afb1
[14:43:32] <tejas-manohar> why printing undefined
[14:44:09] <jfive> i am using this datepicker() plugin at http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html and i was wondering if anyone can help me... some of the text inputs are set to disabled="disabled" and for those the datepicker() isn't binding. any way around this? (there are checkboxes to enable/disable each text input)
[14:51:23] <kokut> should i include jquery at the top of my website so i can add a lot of inline code or its not a good idea?
[14:51:32] <robertmaxrees> don't inline code.
[14:51:41] <robertmaxrees> like, ever
[14:52:44] <robertmaxrees> lots of people include jquery, then have a file for their code after it.  most people include these right before </body>
[14:54:26] <kokut> its not really inline but i dont like working on several different files if i could add a <script></script> right below the element i'm working on
[14:54:52] <robertmaxrees> you should work in different files
[14:55:35] <robertmaxrees> you'll wind up finding it a lot easier in the long run.
[14:55:43] <robertmaxrees> one place to go for HTML and one place for JS.
[14:57:03] <kokut> okay, thank you
[14:57:22] <kokut> do you know how to fetch values from the server (ajax) with jquery?
[14:57:29] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:57:55] <kokut> the best would be to call one of my php functions i have already made in another file
[14:58:04] <kokut> its to fill a list
[14:58:07] <kokut> how can i do it?
[14:58:18] <robertmaxrees> your JS will have no knowledge of your PHP, and vice versa.
[14:58:31] <robertmaxrees> normally you set it up so you have a URL to hit that runs the code server-side.
[14:58:51] <robertmaxrees> and then that code returns what you need.
[14:59:34] <kokut> i've found this $.get( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {  $( ".result" ).html( data );  alert( "Load was performed." );}); instead of alert ("Load was performed.") i could fill my list with the data contained in where?
[15:00:09] <robertmaxrees> or the $('.result').html(data);
[15:00:10] <kokut> what do i have to return with the php? get data?
[15:00:19] <robertmaxrees> whatever you want the call to have.
[15:00:26] <kokut> but do i need to use GET?
[15:00:39] <robertmaxrees> if you're planning on retrieving data, yes.
[15:00:45] <kokut> like my php function returns what?
[15:00:52] <robertmaxrees> dunno php so it's hard to tell.
[15:00:54] <kokut> yea i need a list of items
[15:00:56] <robertmaxrees> it's like any other page though.
[15:01:06] <robertmaxrees> you're basically building a normal page.
[15:01:16] <robertmaxrees> since ajax requests are like almost any other request.
[15:05:54] <kokut> robertmaxrees: you mean with ajax i'm fetching a whole page?
[15:06:10] <robertmaxrees> with ajax you're just fetching a URL.
[15:06:21] <robertmaxrees> that url could return anything.  usually these days it's JSON.
[15:07:42] <kokut> u mean i could fetch data from that URL like site.com/index.php?id=1&time=33&value=13sasdasd etc?
[15:07:53] <kokut> like get variables
[15:08:04] <robertmaxrees> nomally you get JSON back.
[15:08:24] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you could call that URL and get back whatever data you want to return.
[15:08:50] <kokut> i still dont know how it would look in the php file tho
[15:09:31] <robertmaxrees> lots of articles and tutorials out ther.e
[15:11:19] <kokut> yea, i think im going to keep going tomorrow its already a bit late
[15:11:40] <kokut> thanks for helping me out, i advanced a lot today :)
[15:11:43] <robertmaxrees> deffo
[17:03:00] <ashka> is it normal behavior that element.css('width', '123px') does not trigger the resize event ?
[17:10:48] <Mastema> are there any decent mobile emulators to test your website out on to make sure they are looking fine?
[17:16:56] <snover> Mastema: xcode for ios, android sdk for android
[17:40:38] <Mark_2> im trying to create a board like the one in this page : http://desimer.com/experiment/red/ anybody know how to create this kind of animation effect using only jquery?
[17:42:44] <Mark_2> sorry for the repetition : im trying to create a board like the one in this page : http://desimer.com/experiment/red/ anybody know how to create this kind of animation effect using only jquery?
[17:50:50] <Mastema> it is a cool board
[17:50:53] <Mastema> that's for sure lol
[18:06:21] <wheeei^^> hey, I'm a bit rusty with my jQuery/JS and a bit unsure what the best way would be to refractor the commented codesnippet into a function that can be called. http://pastebin.com/YrBRWnh0
[18:19:43] <richie> http://jsfiddle.net/qn7ms807/ Can someone tell me how to automatically add the two first fields instead of having to input them? Thank you very much.
[19:01:23] <wheeei^^> Is there a clean way to change/delete single CSS rules inside a class? If found one way to do a for loop to find all rules and then change the one you want to change but I think that would make the code slow having to create 80 loops just to change a few css rules... I guess its best to just add css rules and override
[19:02:49] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: I'd just use toggle a class that toggles that switches that property.
[19:03:30] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell and add a rules and override..?
[19:04:02] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: Yeah.
[19:06:34] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: http://jsbin.com/bopale/1/edit?css,js,output is what I was thinking.
[19:09:20] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell why create a new class and not just add color:blue to the class and override the property?
[19:11:28] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: This would be more organized in my opinion.
[19:12:11] <BillCriswell> I don't know your whole use case, but if you're just toggling between two states I think that would be the idea approach.
[19:13:21] <BillCriswell> ideal*
[19:15:34] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell hmm I just want to change a property and I think the best way to do is, is http://jsbin.com/wilatanutu/2/ I think adding and overriding css-rules is bad enough
[19:16:00] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell What I really want is to _change_ the rule that already there and not override
[19:16:36] <BillCriswell> So why aren't you just altering the original css?
[19:17:08] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell thats what Im doing but have to do it through JS
[19:18:21] <BillCriswell> ... why don't you add your own stylesheet using js if you only have access to js?
[19:19:22] <BillCriswell> Running .css() on a bunch of elements doesn't seem the wisest move.
[19:20:21] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell hmmmmm the css-file is huge and the website use most of the rest, I only change a portion of all the rules... Maybe I should just load in the classes and override the classes?
[19:22:04] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: You would only write the css for things you need to change.
[19:22:46] <BillCriswell> If you have .foo { color: red; } in their style sheet and load a stylesheet after that with .foo { color: blue } the second one wins.
[19:23:06] <wheeei^^> ok, I get what you mean hmmm I have to think about it
[19:24:05] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[19:24:47] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell all the objects Im going to change gets loaded in with JS on the site, does that change anything? Been working on this for over 14 hours and my head is getting sore
[19:25:16] <BillCriswell> No. CSS doesn't give a crap when something is loaded.
[19:25:32] <BillCriswell> Unlike JS.
[19:26:23] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell when adding a class with jQuery does it merge 2 classes together if the class exist?
[19:27:15] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: Yeah.
[19:27:17] <wheeei^^> There are some classes I only change 5 rules of 10 for example and wanna keep the original 5 and just add my 5 changes and override the original, is that possible?
[19:27:33] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: Yes. CSS is exactly what you want.
[19:28:14] <wheeei^^> okay cool, think I will add the classes then, not too many maybe 20
[19:28:36] <BillCriswell> wheeei^^: Why do you need to add classes?
[19:29:43] <wheeei^^> oops was closer to 70 =(
[19:30:54] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell gonna change the look of a live-site through JS, got the design ready and now I just have to found the best way to override, delete and add the css-changes+html
[19:31:31] <BillCriswell> I thought you didn't have access to the html?
[19:31:56] <wheeei^^> no, I have to change the html through jQuery
[19:32:12] <BillCriswell> That's silly.
[19:32:16] <BillCriswell> but ok.
[19:32:32] <wheeei^^> hm
[19:33:18] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell the html elements Im working with gets loaded in all of them dynamically through the sites JS, its empty when I turn off JS
[19:34:02] <BillCriswell> Good times.
[19:34:28] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell not really, and this is a job challange I have to complete tonight
[19:34:47] <BillCriswell> I was being sarcastic.
[19:34:52] <wheeei^^> I know ;>
[19:35:13] <wheeei^^> just too tired for this shitt, no sense of humor
[19:36:35] <wheeei^^> just finished the design and code for it all, now I have to work hours on how to implement it to a live-site, they go on and on about working through the console in the webrowser and load in all the changes with JS in the instructions
[19:37:29] <BillCriswell> The task sounds weird.
[19:38:28] <wheeei^^> I think the purpose is because they keep testing the sites design in order to make it optimal for user interaction, so they try one design and measure user interaction then load in a diffrent js-script with another design and see which ones performes the best
[19:38:55] <wheeei^^> while keeping the rest of the site intact
[19:39:35] <wheeei^^> only 1 mobile-page get affected because I dont touch any of the pure html and css-files. thats my guess..
[19:40:13] <BillCriswell> So are you replacing certain sections of a page?
[19:41:14] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell yeah
[20:02:49] <bigLanky> I am trying to do this: http://jsfiddle.net/Sk8erPeter/kxrTS/3/ and count checkboxes. This part is working, but I want to set a limit of 3. Can someone help me out here?
[20:06:51] <systemfault> Just bigLanky : http://jsfiddle.net/kxrTS/166/
[20:07:53] <bigLanky> oh great. thanks a lot systemfault!
[20:20:32] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell if I'm going to add a whole jQuery code-snippet with a couple of functions through chrome-dev tools whats the best way to do that? Besides loading in a external stylesheet is there a way I can copy in the script on the page, maybe make it inline on the page?
[20:22:29] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell I just realized that it just sounds silly and I should probably just load in it external
[20:23:25] <wheeei^^> BillCriswell I think I can load in both the css and js external and then edit the html elements with the js... that would be a good way to see my changes on a live site
[20:34:40] <TeddyMurray> anyone familiar with the gmap3 plugin? trying to add Google places api to it
[20:37:14] <Snerf> i always just use google maps api, on its own
[20:37:37] <TeddyMurray> =[
[20:37:41] <TeddyMurray> probably makes more sense
[20:37:55] <Snerf> its simple enough
[21:02:14] <jayjo> If I'd like to submit a form via ajax, do I need to remove the action on the form itself?
[21:04:44] <gtristan> is there an easy enough way to use the easings from jqueryui without jqueryui ?
[21:04:54] <gtristan> I assume I just have to like, install them or smth ?
[21:06:42] * gtristan looks at jqueryui JS and inspects how it installs the easing functions
[21:09:38] <gtristan> hmmm, where is baseEasings defined and extended
[21:12:03] <gtristan> me clones, for some reason grep is not working on github ;-)
[21:13:58] <gtristan> effect.js does it
[21:17:29] <gtristan> hmm
[21:17:45] <gtristan> ok so jqueryui installs the easing functions with $.easing()
[21:18:07] <gtristan> but I'm not finding the docs for the jquery (not jqueryui) method .easing
[21:18:50] <gtristan> oh it's not a function, its an object ?
[21:22:30] <gtristan> think I got it
[21:39:06] <Chulbul> I'm getting this error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unterminated string at line 1 column 699 of the JSON data , when json contains string with ' inside it like can't , doesn't
[21:39:29] <Chulbul> cant doesnt is working fine
[21:40:02] * gtristan tries in his own
[21:41:22] <gtristan> worksforme
[21:41:46] <gtristan> it serialized as:  "en_name" : "It's a pow naye !?",
[21:41:57] <gtristan> lets try double quotes
[21:42:08] <Chulbul> this is html <input type="hidden"  id="customConstants" name="customConstants" value='{"ACCEPTED_SPONSORSHIP":"doesn't"}' /> and in jquery Im using it like this var customConstants =$.parseJSON($("#customConstants").val());
[21:43:05] <gtristan> worksforme again
[21:43:05] <Chulbul> when I view source this input is highlighted with red, it seems as if somethings wrong with this input field but it looks fine ..
[21:43:10] <gtristan> serialized as:   "name" : "C'est \"l'amor\""
[21:43:20] <gtristan> using json-glib to serialize in the backend
[21:43:33] <gtristan> and JSON.parse to deserialize properly serialized json
[21:43:59] <Chulbul> Im using json_encode (php ) to encode array
[21:44:30] <Uhkis> Chulbul: you're closing that value tag with that ' in there
[21:44:31] <gtristan> maybe that's broken, how does it serialize a string like: It's "the pony"
[21:44:36] <Uhkis> *attribute
[21:44:53] <gtristan> it should be serialized as: "It's \"the pony\""
[21:46:29] <Chulbul> ok, let me try it @Uhkis and gtristan
[21:50:39] <Uhkis> Chulbul: http://jsfiddle.net/abv63wyo/1/
[21:56:26] <Chulbul> Uhkis, jquery error is resolved but json_encode from php is causing a break in html hidden field.
[21:57:44] <Chulbul> Uhkis, its double quote issue, let me try
[22:05:27] <Chulbul> Uhkis, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17926354/php-json-encode-jquery-parsejson-single-quote-issue similar issue, that may help me.
[22:07:18] <Uhkis> Chulbul: did you notice that i switched the quotes in that fiddle?
[22:07:41] <Chulbul> Uhkis, yeah I noticed that
[22:08:44] <Chulbul> Uhkis, json_encode($data, JSON_HEX_APOS), this is the answer, php side ..
[22:30:37] <symfonius> hello, I have (I think) a complex selection I want to make and I was hoping for some help. I have a table (table) with multiple rows (td) and one of those rows has a glyphicon in it (small/span)
[22:30:59] <symfonius> How do I select the row with the glyphicon (1) and then check to see what the text is in that row (2) ?
[22:32:18] <Chulbul> symfonius, please make a jsfiddle of your problem.
[22:38:14] <symfonius> Chulbul, like this: http://jsfiddle.net/zuspdr9e/
[22:43:57] <Chulbul> symfonius, http://jsfiddle.net/zuspdr9e/1/
[22:44:59] <symfonius> Chulbul, i don't understand
[22:45:19] <symfonius> that doesn't confirm that the glyphicon is in <td>MATCH<small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span></small></td>
[22:46:01] <symfonius> I thought it would need to be something like $('table > tr > td > small') or something
[22:46:37] <Chulbul> symfonius, sorry but whats the requirement, could you elaborate more ?
[22:46:59] <symfonius> The glyphicon - <small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin"></span></small>
[22:47:10] <symfonius> Needs to be in the same row as the word "MATCH"
[22:48:46] <symfonius> I just want a way to test that it is indeed in the same row
[22:48:59] <symfonius> and then I can display TRUE or FALSE depending on if it is or isn't
[22:54:01] <Chulbul> symfonius, http://jsfiddle.net/zuspdr9e/2/
[22:55:53] <symfonius> thank you
[22:55:55] <symfonius> one final question
[22:56:02] <symfonius> Is it possible to isolate the word "MATCH"?
[22:56:24] <symfonius> Given I have $(this).text(), if I do $(this).parent().parent().text() I'd get something like MATCHfirst td
[22:56:43] <symfonius> is it possible to just get the word "MATCH" - then I can do a string comparison and check that it's in the correct row
[23:01:08] <Chulbul> symfonius, if that td will only contain that match word then its possible, you can use jquery text() or if not just add match inside span field and add class to it and use class as an identifier
[23:02:16] <caper> AJAX.send("fname="+encodeURIComponent(textVal));
[23:02:38] <caper> it is a right way to send the variable value  from js to jsp
[23:03:06] <symfonius> Chulbul, but using .text() will also include "first td" and "third td"
[23:03:10] <symfonius> how can I get it to ignore that part
[23:03:12] <caper> response plz
[23:05:12] <caper> need help dude
[23:05:21] <Chulbul> symfonius, I think its good if you can add something like this <span class="matched">MATCH</span>
[23:05:54] <symfonius> ok
[23:07:41] <caper> is there any possibility to send the variable value from js to jsp
[23:09:52] <Terminus> caper: yes. post the value via ajax.
[23:10:26] <caper> AJAX.send("fname="+encodeURIComponent(textVal));
[23:10:29] <caper> like this
[23:11:23] <Chulbul> symfonius, http://jsfiddle.net/zuspdr9e/4/
[23:11:53] <symfonius> ah okay
[23:12:03] <symfonius> thanks a lot for your help chulbul :)
[23:12:14] <caper> Terminus
[23:12:57] <caper> via ajax how can i send it Terminus
[23:13:18] <Terminus> caper: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[23:13:54] <caper> Hey terminus i see this post
[23:13:56] <caper> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16673526/passing-javascript-variable-to-jsp-via-ajax
[23:15:18] <Terminus> caper: as others have said in that thread, define AJAX.
[23:15:45] <Terminus> caper: you're in a jquery channel. the answer will always be a jquery method. see api doc i pasted.
[23:17:02] <caper> ok

[23:47:42] <caper> hey any one know that plz help me
[23:47:59] <Cork> caper: you should ask that in a java channel not here
[23:48:04] <Cork> its way off topic
[23:48:10] <caper> ok
[23:49:05] <caper> yes cork but but there is no channel of  java in free node
[23:49:28] <Cork> caper: and you thought jquery would be a good substitute??
[23:49:46] <Cork> jquery is javaSCRIPT it has nothing to do with java
[23:50:07] <caper> hey cork i have problem regarding ajax actually
[23:50:37] <caper> i want to send the variable  value from js to jsp via ajax and nothing i want
[23:50:38] <Cork> as long as it is a jquery question, go ahead
[23:50:59] <Cork> you don't send variables, you can send values
[23:51:00] <caper> not jquery question
[23:51:05] <Cork> then again off topic
[23:51:08] <caper> yes value
[23:51:13] <caper> how can i
[23:51:28] <caper> http://jsfiddle.net/tfh1Lajq/
[23:51:46] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'get/post', data: { value: variable } });
[23:52:02] <caper> so in my fiddle i do wromg
[23:52:15] <Cork> donno it isn't jquery or native js
[23:52:42] <caper> or in jsp page how can i get  the value of variable
[23:53:14] <Cork> again, jsp is off topic
[23:53:19] <caper> ok
[23:53:45] <Cork> try ##java they might be able to help you
[23:53:55] <Cork> at least it is the same language as your question
[23:55:26] <wheeei^^> how do I prepend a li-element to the top of the list?
[23:55:35] <Cork> prepend?
[23:55:47] <wheeei^^> well I thinking I must prependTo parent somehow
[23:55:55] <Cork> yes
[23:56:10] <Cork> prepend or prependTo depending on how you structure the code
[23:56:23] <wheeei^^> but how? I need to use the parent() function or some other way to target the parent
[23:56:39] <Cork> ?paste @ wheeei^^
[23:56:50] <Cork> ah, the bot is dead
[23:57:08] <Cork> wheeei^^: put the html structure and the snippet of js you work in in a jsfiddle.net
[23:57:17] <Joonaa> if the timeupdate fires while user is dragging the #htmlaudio_seek bar (range input), it steals away the slider from the user and the user has to move it again (to change the seekbar value). how can i stop this behaviour? http://jsfiddle.net/rum5LLhq/
[23:57:37] <wheeei^^> Cork ok
[23:58:48] <hrust> anyone know for candle stick graph plugin?
