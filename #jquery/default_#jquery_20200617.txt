[09:48:24] <IHasFingers> hi guys, i am making a request to an api getting data and i need to build a form to then display to a user which will fill information on the form. I am wondering if to an empty form tag e.g. <form></form> just hidden in the html and then append the inputs to it from the api
[09:48:43] <IHasFingers> or built a form in jquery
[09:49:02] <IHasFingers> p.s. the form will be shown to the user via a pop up
[10:41:34] <IHasFingers> please can someone help me https://jsfiddle.net/kozh39a7/1/
[10:42:08] <IHasFingers> I am have been trying to build the form using jquery but its not appending correctly

[13:04:32] <Flyste> I have a function that runs a ajax call to check to see if a code is valid and if so returns true.  When I try to check the function the true doesn't seem to get returned in time and the if (!checkPromo()) gets triggered I belive because of the asynronous nature of the the ajax call, is there a way to make sure it waits until it gets the result from the ajax call before processing ?
[13:05:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to return out of the ajax call?
[13:05:12] <robertmaxrees> (show some clode pls)
[13:06:34] <robertmaxrees> Flyste
[13:07:41] <Flyste> Mmm
[13:07:50] <Flyste> Where is best to paste code?
[13:08:03] <robertmaxrees> check the channel topic :)
[13:11:07] <Flyste> The formatting is getting all messed up, give me a sec
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> just press the "tidy" button :)
[13:11:27] <Flyste> That button is amazing
[13:11:50] <Flyste> https://jsfiddle.net/eou38nmc/
[13:12:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so you can't do that.
[13:12:39] <Flyste> What can I do?
[13:13:03] <robertmaxrees> ajax is asynchronous (the first word in the acronym, even!).  what version of jquery are you using?
[13:14:06] <Flyste> 1.8.2
[13:15:01] <robertmaxrees> i think you can just return the ajax call and then use .then() from inside the calling function.
[13:16:40] <Flyste> Not sure I understand, so like after success: function(response).than() ?
[13:16:45] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:16:47] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:16:53] <robertmaxrees> lemme show you.
[13:17:17] <robertmaxrees> so right now your code is basically if (!validatePromo()) {, right?
[13:17:25] <Flyste> Exactly
[13:18:38] <robertmaxrees> so you'll need to make 3 small tweaks :)
[13:19:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e7nw61gk/
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> first - you need to move that if statement out of your "validatePromo" function.  instead conditionally call it based on that if check.
[13:20:21] <robertmaxrees> second - you need to use a .then() (instead of success) to execute your success logic.
[13:20:40] <robertmaxrees> this then means that you get the third change - you use .catch() to handle any failure cases.
[13:22:54] <Flyste> I'll have to look over this a bit
[13:23:23] <Flyste> Thanks for help
[13:23:56] <robertmaxrees> sure.  if you have any questions, lemme know.
