[00:44:47] <feedme> Hello
[00:45:29] <feedme> Curious how one would go about adding the ability to sort product listing on a webpage in order of lowest price to highest
[01:07:57] <Cork> feedme: depends, do you need pagination (meaning all data isn't in the webpage)?
[01:08:57] <feedme> I dont believe we need pagination. Everything should load with the webpage
[01:09:25] <feedme> take this site for example. https://buyreservations.com/airport-hotel-search/Milwaukee-Airport-Hotels-MKE/ would there be a plain js or jquery solution?
[01:10:30] <Cork> hmm you have a hr between the rows that complicates things
[01:11:10] <feedme> supose the hr was removed
[01:11:17] <feedme> suppose the hr was removed
[01:12:44] <Cork> if you didn't have it i would just do something like $('.rd-row').sort(function(a,b) { var aText = $(a).find('h4').text(), bText = $(a).find('h4').text(); if(a < b) { return -1; } if(b > a) { return 1; } return 0; })
[01:12:56] <Cork> and then just append that list back in the parent
[01:13:35] <Cork> you will prob have to convert the text to a number though else $199.00 will be sorted before $99.00
[01:13:57] <feedme> hmmm
[01:14:09] <feedme> "and then just append that list back in the parent" this part has me a little confused
[01:14:34] <Cork> what that line does is grab app .rd-row elements in the page
[01:14:47] <Cork> then sort them after the h4 content (the price)
[01:14:57] <Cork> the result will be the sorted list, the way you want it
[01:15:09] <Cork> and then you just append the elements again to move them to that order
[01:16:18] <feedme> how do i achieve this part "and then you just append the elements again to move them to that order"
[01:16:29] <feedme> I really appreciate all the help!
[01:16:35] <Cork> $(parent).append()?
[01:19:05] <feedme> Thank you. Im going to try to implement something like this asap
[01:19:20] <feedme> I really appreciate all the help, cant wait till im good enough to return the favor to others
[01:20:40] <Cork> feedme: https://jsfiddle.net/sey6cgu1/
[01:21:24] <Cork> but for this to work you need to only have a list of the same type
[01:21:32] <Cork> you can't have other things mixed inbetween
[01:21:42] <Cork> cause if you do they will jump to the top after the sort
[02:42:02] <TeddyMurray> workfar.com -- my site relies heavily on jquery, used all the tricks, check it out if you need an online job
[02:59:29] <arunkumar413> I have an array of class selected using var a = document.getElementsByClassName("edu");
[02:59:52] <arunkumar413> How do i access the input elements values of a[0], a[1] etc,.
[03:43:00] <Cork> arunkumar413: exactly like that
[03:43:15] <Cork> a[0].value will be the value of the first input element
[03:43:27] <Cork> arunkumar413: though note this is not jquery, but native dom queries
[03:44:06] <arunkumar413> Cork: so if I want to select the second input element value?
[03:44:15] <Cork> a[1].value?
[03:44:46] <Cork> or you could just do $('.edu').eq(1).val()
[03:44:52] <arunkumar413> a[0] has multiple input elements
[03:45:01] <Cork> then a isn't the input element
[03:45:08] <Cork> but a parent
[03:45:17] <Cork> and then you would have to find the input element
[03:45:27] <arunkumar413> a is the variable that hold the class divs
[03:45:33] <Cork> no
[03:45:37] <Cork> it contains the divs
[03:45:45] <arunkumar413> Cork: http://jsbin.com/wojeracahi/edit?html,js,console,output
[03:45:49] <Cork> the selector is only about how it finds them
[03:46:03] <arunkumar413> here is the jsbin to show how the div are organised
[03:46:13] <Cork> don't use jsbin
[03:46:24] <Cork> the data is lost all the time when you share those links
[03:46:38] <Cork> (ex. the html section is empty)
[03:47:00] <Cork> preferably use jsfiddle.net
[03:47:50] <arunkumar413> jsfiddle doesn't have the console to test
[03:47:53] <arunkumar413> the output
[03:48:41] <arunkumar413> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/6z3mm6fy/
[03:49:57] <Cork> just a fyi you have broken br lines <br <br>
[03:50:28] <Cork> arunkumar413: so firstly, are you going to use jquery or not?
[03:50:40] <arunkumar413> I want to use
[03:52:07] <Cork> arunkumar413: https://jsfiddle.net/6z3mm6fy/1/
[03:56:27] <arunkumar413> Cork: thanks. Is there a good documentation on this type of selection '.edu input[name="spez"
[03:57:02] <Cork> arunkumar413: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors
[03:57:30] <Cork> you might also want to read http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[03:57:32] <arunkumar413> most of the documentation I came across is about selecting CSS selector like ids, classes, tags, etc,. But combining with the classes, ids and elements
[03:57:47] <Cork> arunkumar413: it is the normal css selectors
[03:57:59] <Cork> in native js it is written as document.querySelectorAll()
[03:58:17] <Cork> (and is what jquery uses under the hood)
[04:02:08] <arunkumar413> actually I also want the length of the selection of calsses
[04:05:41] <Cork> "selection of classes"?
[04:05:47] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[04:07:03] <arunkumar413> Cork: first I want to select all the classes and then for each class (a[0], a[1],...) get the input values using the name attribute
[04:07:19] <Cork> what do you mean all the classes?
[04:07:23] <Cork> you mean all the divs?
[04:07:29] <arunkumar413> Cork: yes
[04:08:00] <Cork> arunkumar413: as each div contains the field you can just do a .length on the find to get that
[04:08:47] <Cork> arunkumar413: https://jsfiddle.net/6z3mm6fy/2/
[04:09:53] <arunkumar413> Cork: you're selecting all the spez elements at a time .edu input[name="spez"
[04:10:06] <Cork> ya? and why does that matter?
[04:10:13] <arunkumar413> Cork: just a min
[04:10:22] <arunkumar413> let me explain you better
[04:10:40] <Cork> try to represent what you're trying to do in the fiddle if possible
[04:10:44] <Cork> it is normally better
[04:14:38] <arunkumar413> Cork: let 'a' be the variable containing divs with class name "mydiv". Now a[0] contains 2 text inputs. Similarly a[1] contains 2 inputs. First I want to select a[0] and its inputs using the name attribute. Then move to a[1] and select the input attributes using the name attributes.
[04:15:13] <Cork> sure, but why?
[04:15:34] <Cork> your specifying how you thought of doing something not why
[04:17:55] <arunkumar413> because my application need to access that way
[04:18:12] <Cork> O_o'
[04:18:35] <Cork> ok, can you provide the function call you need to call or anything so one can understand the limitation?
[04:19:14] <arunkumar413> Cork: from you code it's not possible to know which input value belongs to which a
[04:19:21] <Cork> sure there is
[04:19:33] <Cork> just check the parent element
[04:32:21] <arunkumar413> Cork: I'd like to access them sequentially. Similar to how the DOM is organised. that
[04:32:38] <Cork> the selector i gave you does that
[04:53:32] <TeddyMurray> anyone ever wonder how to change a page dynamically and keep a browser history going?
[04:53:52] <TeddyMurray> i have a solution, i'd like to hear yours
[05:00:46] <Cork> just use navigatior.history.pushState
[05:01:39] <Cork> opps
[05:01:45] <Cork> window.history.pushState :)
[05:02:31] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API#The_pushState()_method
[06:07:32] <Dunams> I have a list of around 15~ checkboxes which are divided into groups in the database, what's the way to identify them in HTML so I could use jquery to select the boxes corresponding with the group?
[06:07:55] <Dunams> for example, by clicking "group 1" it will mark checkboxes 1,5,10,13
[08:42:42] <Neo1> hi guys!
[08:43:51] <Neo1> how to choose the width of screen, I need to check if the display less than 700px and use my own function
[08:45:02] <moveax> Neo1: http://api.jquery.com/width/
[08:45:09] <moveax> $( window ).width();
[08:45:51] <Xatenev> hey
[08:45:56] <Xatenev> what is the alternative to $.ajax error callback?
[08:46:02] <Neo1> and interesting how javascript work, if at first will call function which handle the same selector and then my function, they will working consistently?
[08:46:59] <Neo1> on the site exists function which show and hide menu
[08:49:31] <Neo1> moveax: work all
[08:49:46] <Neo1> everything
[08:55:42] <Cork> Xatenev: $.ajax().fail(function() {})
[08:56:35] <Xatenev> Cork, Does that is triggered even if cross origin happens?
[08:56:43] <Xatenev> Cork, like.. I am really confused - I have a tablet
[08:56:46] <Xatenev> Cork, And a phonegap app on it
[08:56:55] <Cork> depends
[08:56:58] <Xatenev> Cork, It makes a call to 192.168.0.66
[08:57:00] <Xatenev> Cork, which is my PC
[08:57:06] <Xatenev> Cork, Is this now a cross origin request?
[08:57:07] <Cork> what you make it to doesn't really matter
[08:57:10] <Cork> it is how you do it
[08:57:22] <Xatenev> Cork, or is it not?
[08:57:47] <Cork> if you have a server on something the browser consideres to not be the same fqdn (including port) as the current site
[08:57:54] <Cork> then it is by definition a cors request
[08:58:07] <Xatenev> Cork, well it is the current site...
[08:58:12] <Xatenev> All calls are made to 192.168.0.66
[08:58:15] <Xatenev> The phonegap app is basically just a webview
[08:58:18] <Cork> if the server on the cors target response with a cors header it can be let through though
[08:58:19] <Xatenev> that includes a page
[08:58:42] <Cork> Xatenev: the ip doesn't matter
[08:58:51] <Cork> it is what the request is
[08:59:09] <Cork> http://localhost:8000/ => http://localhost:8001 is cors
[08:59:22] <Cork> http://localhost:8000/ => http://127.0.0.1:8000 is cors
[08:59:33] <Cork> http://localhost:8000/ => http://localhost:8000 is NOT cors
[08:59:46] <Xatenev> Cork, so I would have to check how the webview is bound in?
[08:59:52] <Xatenev> Cork, to say whteher its actually a cors request or not?
[09:00:04] <Cork> not how it is bound in, what it connects to
[09:00:04] <Xatenev> Cork, I dont really know how that webvie stuff works
[09:00:18] <Cork> (and you don't need to prefix every line with my nick)
[09:00:27] <Xatenev> Sry. IRC habbit
[09:00:47] <Cork> webview is just an embedded browser basically
[09:00:58] <Cork> it takes an url that it loads
[09:01:13] <Cork> and if you make a request from that page to a different url, then it is cors
[09:01:25] <Cork> worth meantioning is the original url might be file://
[09:01:29] <Cork> and then EVERYTHING is cors
[09:01:44] <Xatenev> Cork, just realized I dont think its really a webview
[09:01:53] <Xatenev> Cork, We are copying the whole page to a www/ folder
[09:01:54] <Xatenev> into the app
[09:01:57] <Cork> ermf...
[09:02:01] <Xatenev> Sorry
[09:02:18] <Xatenev> yep
[09:02:23] <Xatenev> the original url seems to be file:///android_asset/www/ your right
[09:02:30] <Cork> ya, so it is cors
[09:02:33] <Xatenev> thanks!
[09:02:46] <Xatenev> complete: should be called even though its cors right?
[09:02:49] <Xatenev> On $.ajax
[09:02:56] <Cork> no
[09:03:03] <Xatenev> aaah
[09:03:05] <Cork> there is no difference in what callback is called
[09:03:09] <Xatenev> What else can i use?
[09:03:20] <Cork> if you make an ajax call from a site to a site where cors will trigger
[09:03:25] <Cork> you won't get anything back
[09:03:29] <Cork> so no callback will fire
[09:03:42] <Xatenev> Well CORS doesn't really trigger
[09:03:42] <Cork> there are two options
[09:03:45] <Xatenev> I don't get a warning in the console
[09:03:47] <Xatenev> it returns 404
[09:03:56] <Cork> then you have a different problem :)
[09:04:08] <Xatenev> Are you sure?
[09:04:11] <Xatenev> there is an explicit note in the jquery docs
[09:04:17] <Xatenev> that error: isnt being called on all cors calls
[09:04:27] <Cork> or if you explicitly expected to get the 404 error
[09:04:34] <Xatenev> Note: This handler is not called for cross-domain script and cross-domain JSONP requests.
[09:04:39] <Cork> then you are back to problem 1. you have to make cors allow the response through
[09:04:54] <Cork> Xatenev: jsonp isn't really ajax
[09:05:03] <Xatenev> cross-domain script requests
[09:05:04] <Cork> it is <script src=""> tags injected in the page header
[09:05:15] <Cork> and you won't get callbacks from those
[09:05:21] <Xatenev> I do url: 'something/language.js'
[09:05:27] <Xatenev> that sounds like it would be a cross domain script request
[09:05:39] <Cork> if the type is jsonp it is
[09:05:47] <Xatenev> I didnt specify the typ
[09:05:50] * Xatenev looks up default
[09:05:54] <Cork> the default is get
[09:06:07] <Cork> or do i remember wrong.. i think i do...
[09:06:07] <Xatenev> dataType is script
[09:06:27] <Cork> for $.getScript you mean?
[09:06:31] <Xatenev> no its $.ajax
[09:06:32] <Cork> it isn't default for $.ajax
[09:06:36] <Xatenev> and we set dataType: 'script'
[09:06:40] <Cork> ah
[09:06:42] <Xatenev> explicitly
[09:07:09] <Cork> let me look up jsonp (i never use it so i don't have it in memory)
[09:08:18] <Cork> ok, so ya it will still use a <script> tag if the resource is cross origin
[09:08:32] <Cork> you can set crossDomain: true to avoid this
[09:08:42] <Xatenev> That makes it a casual XHR callß
[09:08:46] <Xatenev> and thus call the callbacks?
[09:08:47] <Cork> but then you need to config the server to use cors headers (i strongly recommend this)
[09:08:50] <Cork> yes
[09:09:08] <Xatenev> AH thats why I get no notice in the console right?
[09:09:12] <Xatenev> because it circumvents it by using <script>
[09:09:14] <Cork> yup
[09:09:16] <Xatenev> aaaah
[09:09:20] <Xatenev> everything makes senes now
[09:09:26] <Xatenev> thanks!
[09:09:49] <Cork> also if you use jquery 2.x or newer i think you get basic errors even if $.ajax uses <script>
[09:09:55] <Xatenev> 1.11 :)
[09:09:58] <Cork> but with 1.x you get silent errors
[09:10:17] <Xatenev> Cork, thanks a lot, as usual your super helpful
[09:10:25] <Cork> (requirements cause old ie doesn't provide the error event)
[09:10:53] <Cork> yw :)
[09:16:23] <Xatenev> Hm im still not getting a CORs error even though ive set crossDomain: true
[09:16:34] <Cork> it should be false not true :)
[09:16:40] <Xatenev> wat
[09:16:44] <Cork> true is the default for cross origin requests
[09:16:55] <Cork> and you cant it to NOT handle it as cross origin
[09:35:29] <Xatenev> Cork, worked great btw
[09:35:31] <Xatenev> Cork, thanks :]
[09:35:40] <Cork> nice
[12:08:49] <jQueryQs> Is there a reason why $('#content').load('https://example.com/category/polo-shirts #recently-viewed'); would grab the wrong div and append that instead? From what I noticed, it's grabbed another div that has the word 'view' but not 'viewed'.
[12:10:36] <Xatenev> jQueryQs, eh sounds weird
[12:10:45] <Xatenev> jQueryQs, is that a public page?
[12:11:05] <jQueryQs> no its not :\
[12:11:51] <Xatenev> jQueryQs, Sounds like your observation might be wrong
[12:15:14] <jQueryQs> Xatenev would you know if targeting classes can have an issue? I wouldn't know what I'm doing wrong, I'm positive I'm selecting the right class. It's just appending the wrong div.
[12:16:09] <Xatenev> I dunno :\
[12:16:13] <Xatenev> But I don#t think so
[13:06:25] <specialtech> robertmaxrees sorry to bother, but I'm having issues with jquery load and it pulling a different div than the one I'm requesting. Although both divs have similar names. One is .recently-viewed while the other is .wl-view
[13:08:07] <specialtech> here is a fiddle of how I'm using the load, both options I've tried and both ways result in the same thing: https://jsfiddle.net/qL2vbhaz/
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> specialtech i'm confused.  is it not grabbing the .recently-viewed element?
[13:17:03] <specialtech> nope
[13:17:09] <specialtech> it's grabbing a whole other element
[13:17:10] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> also: any reason you need to do it this way and not just make a small api endpoint with the data you need and hten inject as necessar?
[13:17:25] <robertmaxrees> *necessary
[13:17:50] <specialtech>  * jQuery JavaScript Library v1.10.1
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> hunn,
[13:17:59] <robertmaxrees> *humm
[13:19:38] <specialtech> robertmaxrees the dev team takes 3 months to implement any requests sadly, I'm only trying to test a feature w.o spending too much time, to confirm it's worth sending the request and having it updated asap.
[13:21:38] <robertmaxrees> so this is just for a POC?
[13:22:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see it break, sadly.
[13:29:46] <soqr> How to filter so each category filter checkboxes : http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/2/
[13:29:49] <soqr> ?
[13:30:03] <robertmaxrees> specialtech no need to PM duder :)
[13:30:46] <robertmaxrees> soqr huh?
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> soqr are ytou trying to filter by class?
[13:31:53] <rjCousineau> hello. How can I select the a sibling element with classname, in the prev direction?
[13:32:10] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau are there multiple siblings with that classname?
[13:32:13] <robertmaxrees> or just the one??>
[13:32:14] <rjCousineau> yes
[13:32:14] <soqr> if I for example check --> "red" and "white" it shows all that contains red and white, but I want to show only content that is red and white togheter
[13:32:18] <robertmaxrees> hummm
[13:32:19] <rjCousineau> multiple
[13:32:32] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau so you want things that are both red and white, not red or white?
[13:32:38] <robertmaxrees> errr, soqr - my bad
[13:32:49] <soqr> exacly :)
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> soqr change your logic to use OR instead of AND :)
[13:33:17] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: <tr class="empRow"></tr><tr></tr><tr>I am here</tr> select empRow
[13:33:42] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau can you make a fiddle?
[13:33:48] <rjCousineau> sure
[13:34:51] <soqr> robertmaxrees: this is a jsfiddle I found
[13:35:06] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zsfshzt8/
[13:35:09] <robertmaxrees> soqr do you understand anything about what it's doing?
[13:35:13] <soqr> I dont see anywhere they use or ( || )
[13:35:31] <robertmaxrees> soqr you'll need to redo the getFilter stuff.
[13:35:36] <robertmaxrees> kind of overcomplicated imo.
[13:36:24] <soqr> robertmaxrees: is it hard to change?
[13:36:33] <robertmaxrees> soqr not really.  just a strange way to do it.
[13:36:50] <soqr> robertmaxress: Can you help me out?
[13:36:58] <robertmaxrees> soqr that's what the channel is for :)
[13:37:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd check out the jquery filter method.
[13:37:07] <soqr> oh, thx :)
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> i'd also consider breaking out the classes on .filterme elements into different data attributes instead
[13:39:55] <soqr> thats even better =)
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> data-brand="Audi" data-type="Compact" data-colors="white red blue"
[13:43:01] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/zsfshzt8/1/
[13:43:52] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau sorry duder - gotta dayjob, too :)
[13:43:53] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[13:44:09] <soqr> rjCousineau maybe I can help you
[13:44:18] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau hum.  this seems odd to m,e.  i feel like the markup itself might be a little conflated.
[13:44:33] <rjCousineau> soqr: if you have any suggestions..
[13:44:36] <robertmaxrees> *convoluted
[13:44:46] <robertmaxrees> like, what is ".empRow"
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> how does it relate back to #start?
[13:45:02] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:45:29] <soqr> Can you make an example how it should work? any pictures?
[13:45:39] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: .empRow is a prent, and the next sibling is it's child.  I'm doing sibling <tr> elements as children.. you're right it is convuluted, but for AJAX I needed to create a <tr> and load ajax in there
[13:45:50] <rjCousineau> *parent, sorry'
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> "load ajax in there"?
[13:46:23] <robertmaxrees> i thought you were trying to find a tr, not make one.
[13:46:42] <rjCousineau> so from a <tr>, i create and append another <tr> and load ajax into a <td> inside of that.  I need to reference the parent <tr> from inside the created <tr> :s
[13:46:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean sibling TR, right?
[13:47:04] <rjCousineau> I've already created one.. now that i've created it, and i'm inside it, i'm trying to find the "parent sibling"
[13:47:11] <rjCousineau> sibling TR correct
[13:48:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a recursive function that keeps checking if the .prev() element has the given class.
[13:48:32] <rjCousineau> ok cool
[13:48:39] <robertmaxrees> if it does, return it, if not, run again.

[13:48:47] <specialtech> robertmaxrees - anything you can think of that I can test as to see why it's pulling the wrong info? or should I just load the whole page, and then find the specific div within the function?
[13:49:47] <soqr> robertmaxrees : did you find out anyway to my question about the filter?
[13:50:04] <robertmaxrees> rjCousineau https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zsfshzt8/3/
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> this is the basic idea.
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> soqr i already told you the basics.
[13:50:17] <robertmaxrees> you didn';t ask any questions.
[13:51:13] <soqr> robertmaxrees: I thought you where trying to fix it when you said " i'd check out the jquery filter method." :P
[13:51:35] <robertmaxrees> soqr that was a suggestion for you to read the docs heh
[13:51:38] <robertmaxrees> i'm not gonna do it for you.
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> take a crack at it yourself and ask for help :)
[13:51:56] <rjCousineau> robertmaxrees: that seems good, ty
[13:53:32] <soqr> robertmaxrees: Can you give me any ideas? would be helpful
[14:03:01] <soqr> robertmaxrees, maybe this is easier ? ---> https://jsfiddle.net/7ez8o1ra/35/
[14:21:55] <robertmaxrees> heckuva day
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> soqr lol are you just looking for examples to modify?
[14:26:12] <robertmaxrees> soqr start by trying to get an array of all selected values.
[14:26:53] <soqr> robertmaxrees: no I do jquery code allday long, but Im not so good with filtering
[14:27:20] <robertmaxrees> great time to learn.
[14:27:20] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:27:26] <soqr> Do more basic jquery stuff, this kind of stuff I still need help from experts
[14:27:28] <robertmaxrees> try getting an array of all active filters.
[14:27:37] <robertmaxrees> it's super easy.
[14:27:54] <soqr> ok, just to show a picture of what I want to do: https://i.imgur.com/4W6eQBh.png
[14:28:07] <robertmaxrees> i know what you want
[14:28:19] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting somebody to do it for you as an example or something?
[14:28:23] <soqr> new fiddle I working on: http://jsfiddle.net/ar3PY/104/
[14:28:53] <specialtech> robert hey no worries, we're going to go in a different direction, thanks for taking teh time to respond
[14:29:06] <robertmaxrees> specialtech sure.  sorry i couldn't be of more help!
[14:29:11] <soqr> I just thought if there was a easy way to do it someone could show me that ( if its a 1 min thing to do )
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> soqr yeah, wrong place for that sadly.
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> we're here to help you learn./
[14:30:00] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're confused by my thing about wanting to do an "or" instead of an "and"
[14:30:10] <specialtech> robert you're always a big help :)
[14:30:33] <robertmaxrees> hah, nah.  just a good rubber duck ;)
[14:30:33] <specialtech> if there were awards for most helpful dev of the year, it's between you and taplar haha
[14:30:49] <robertmaxrees> he wins.  i'm too snarky hahahaha
[14:32:10] <soqr> robertmaxrees: if I do an OR, I type || , but just confusing about how to code it in the filter, cause it doesn't use any && and that is what it do now..
[14:39:37] <robertmaxrees> yeah, I'd kill the filter entirely and start over.
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> since it's not really what you want.
[14:40:52] <soqr> ok :/
[14:41:21] <soqr> I put it here also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47188286/filtering-show-checked-filter-that-only-has-exacly-same-attribute-for-each-cate

[22:00:14] <Johnny> Your Grunt documentation is horrible- I follow the instructions verbate

[22:01:23] <Guest91796> You should maybe use STEP by STEP instructions
[22:02:06] <Guest91796> Aborted due to warnings.
[22:02:20] <Guest91796> very frustating
[22:02:47] <Guest91796> why not include ALL the relevant libraries?
[22:03:02] <Guest91796> why put people through this HELL
[22:03:14] <Guest91796> I don't get it
[22:03:37] <Guest91796> missing GRUNT this... missing GRUNT that
[22:05:56] <drej> what are you talking about?
[22:06:13] <drej> did you run npm install?
[22:07:06] <Guest91796> yes, I installed grunt on my local machine using npm install -g grunt-cli
[22:07:44] <Guest91796> changed to my project folder and typed grunt
[22:08:00] <Guest91796> got all sort of missing ... errors
[22:08:55] <Guest91796> then it aborts and never builds anything
[22:09:27] <Guest91796> running it in the same folder as my Gruntfile.js
[22:09:46] <Guest91796> running MAMP
[22:10:34] <Guest91796> my understanding is that if i run grunt in the same dir as my grunt file- it should build something
[22:12:03] <Guest91796> what am I missing?
[22:14:09] <Guest91796> you're responses have been really helpful -NOT
[23:23:38] <luffyuzumaki> Hi Guys, I am trying to find use Jquery Ui's Sortable and the mouse events at the same time. So when i clone my sortable with parameter (true) my mouse events work but sortable doesn't, if i clone with empty parameter and rebind sortable, it works but mouse events don't. What is the best way to achieve both of those?
[23:24:06] <luffyuzumaki> find a way to use*
