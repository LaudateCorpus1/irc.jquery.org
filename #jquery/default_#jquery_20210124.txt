[06:56:47] <thiras[m]> hello
[11:24:43] <dimi1947> I am facing a weird case take a look at the image snapshot from my PC https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjCBrCpLQye-iBe3EFO_Eq-haQYC?e=TFIsbg and from the fiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/1oewz50r/18/   it is exactly the same HTML...but they are displayed differently...why...I cannot understand
[11:27:08] <dimi1947> I can give more info upon request
[11:38:20] <dimi1947> I testes the HTML locally separately from the other HTML of that page and it appeared like fiddle...so something in my page(some css probably) is creating it
[12:29:35] <sine0> hey robertmaxrees you here bro
[12:30:08] <sine0> If I want to watch multiple elements and have the same action, is there a way I can list all the class/id names in $('#gc_height').on('input', function (e) {
[12:31:32] <sine0> looks like you can do it with a comma
[17:30:30] <thiras[m]> helllo. why `.data` method doesn't work with dynamically added items? It works when I do `$("div").find(`[data-location="${inventoryId}"]`).data("location")` but not with `$("div").data("location")`
[17:34:31] <shoky> thiras[m]: $("div").data("location")  gets the location data for the first div in the document..
[17:35:22] <thiras[m]> shoky: I have only one <div data-location="01>
[17:35:36] <shoky> thiras[m]: that is the only <div> in the whole page?
[17:35:56] <thiras[m]> and it doesn't select it
[17:36:13] <thiras[m]> oh wait
[17:36:16] <thiras[m]> no
[17:36:17] <shoky> $("div")  selects all <div>s in the page
[17:36:46] <shoky> .data('xxx')  gets the data for only the _first_ element found
[17:36:47] <thiras[m]> got your point. so how can I get the only div that has `data-location=01`
[17:37:01] <shoky> with the first thing you wrote..?
[17:37:11] <shoky> well
[17:37:18] <thiras[m]> is that the best way to that?
[17:37:26] <shoky> $('div[data-location="..."]')
[17:37:32] <shoky> "best" depends on context
[17:37:50] <thiras[m]> i meant the fastest
[17:37:57] <shoky> it's fast enough.
[17:38:37] <thiras[m]> thank you very much
[23:02:43] <jak2020> https://ghanhass.github.io/myfiddle-beta/34   <--- how to click on the image, and show actual size?$(".myDiv")
[23:03:12] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "actual size"?
[23:03:32] <jak2020> yes the image is more biger (the size)
[23:03:51] <robertmaxrees> you mean show it at its original size?
[23:03:56] <jak2020> yes :)
[23:04:13] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[23:04:16] <robertmaxrees> do you want it in a modal?
[23:04:41] <robertmaxrees> err wait that's in a modal.  are you trying to make it bigger, then?
[23:04:53] <jak2020> yes
[23:05:05] <jak2020> show it at its original size
[23:05:18] <robertmaxrees> you'll have ot make the modal bigger.
[23:05:48] <robertmaxrees> looks like the css is setting .modal-dialog to 600px wide.
[23:08:14] <jak2020> okay
[23:11:41] <jak2020> oo intersting: <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg" style="width:80%;">
[23:11:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[23:15:03] <robertmaxrees> You're going to have to get the original size of the image and then adjust the modal accordingly.
[23:15:28] <robertmaxrees> randomly setting widths won't really do much good.  you'll also need to account for cases where the image is larger than the window.
[23:21:51] <jak2020> ok
[23:21:55] <jak2020> in a new page?
[23:22:00] <jak2020> show in a new page?
[23:22:06] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[23:22:12] <robertmaxrees> didn't we do that the other week??
[23:24:13] <jak2020> yes
[23:24:41] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, just do that.
[23:24:45] <robertmaxrees> like i suggested originally lol
[23:29:58] <jak2020> thanks
