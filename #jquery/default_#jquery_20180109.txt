[01:32:26] <Cork> milk: you need to block the link navigation, link navigation reloads the page so dom state is lost
[01:32:48] <Cork> milk: alternatively just remove the <a> link
[01:33:13] <Cork> s/link/tag/
[01:33:13] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> milk: alternatively just remove the <a> tag
[02:36:47] <milk> i've added a event.stopPropagation();, and it seems to work from the console, but when i load the page it doesn't work, but if i copy/paste lines 3212-3217 from the source into the console, hit enter, /then/ clicking the link collapses the menu :/
[02:37:02] * milk scratches head
[02:37:10] <Cork> no, use event.preventDefault() not stopPropagation()
[02:37:19] <Cork> you close to NEVER want to use stopPropagation()
[02:38:23] <Cork> milk: are you rebuilding the html with javascript somewhere?
[02:38:41] <Cork> cause that would give that effect
[02:43:05] <milk> Cork; okies. just the other hack on 3205 to rewrite wikipedia urls.
[02:44:14] <Cork> (your line refs are off), what line are you referring to
[02:44:16] <Cork> *?
[02:46:03] <milk> document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){ document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(/>(http|https):\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\//g,'>WP: ')});
[02:46:21] <Cork> uh...
[02:46:31] <Cork> thats why the click handler breaks
[02:46:37] <Cork> that rerenders the entire page...
[02:46:50] <Cork> (as it serializes to string and then back to dom)
[02:47:42] <milk> ugly as fuck
[02:47:50] <Cork> a better option would be something like $('a[href*="en.wikipedia.org/wiki"]').each(function() {})
[02:48:07] <Cork> or even better fix it server side
[02:48:21] <Woet> milk: what are you actually trying to do?
[02:48:59] <milk> Cork; thanks
[02:49:15] <Cork> localice wikipedia links i think?
[02:49:36] <milk> Woet; have a link (eventually two links) to hide the second level menu headings (and just third)
[02:50:26] <milk> the other thing's just to save time and screenspace
[06:01:37] <adnn_> Is there a function similar to prev() but that will account for HTML comments? I'm looking to read the comment right above a given element.
[06:02:54] <thykka> adnn_, not in jQuery
[06:03:24] <adnn_> I see, do you have anything to suggest?
[06:04:03] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator
[06:04:05] <thykka> oops
[06:04:11] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator
[06:07:46] <adnn_> Seems useful, thanks
[06:45:54] <hellyeah> i have object i want to build a table within dialog. What callback i need to use?
[06:47:29] * Woet blinks
[06:48:21] <hellyeah> i dont know what that means
[06:48:48] <thykka> ditto
[06:49:00] <Woet> same
[06:51:24] <hellyeah> which callback is appropriate for iterating object?
[06:51:29] <hellyeah> afteropen or smt
[06:52:57] <thykka> *beep* *boop* Not enough data for meaningful answer *beepbeep*
[06:53:11] <hellyeah> what time is it?
[06:53:15] <hellyeah> it is fun time
[06:54:44] <thykka> no, it's the vague questions time
[06:54:59] <hellyeah> i have json object
[06:55:03] <thykka> should I use a green or crocodile pliers?
[06:55:08] <hellyeah> i nedd to put that json into dialog box
[06:55:16] <hellyeah> how is it not clear?
[06:55:17] <thykka> and which is best? foamy, streamlined or vmware?
[06:55:55] <hellyeah> thykka,  i am at work
[06:56:00] <hellyeah> i need to finish that
[06:57:27] <thykka> 1. I have no idea what your JSON looks like 2. I have no idea what parts of that JSON you wanna use 3. I have no idea how you need to format the data for viewing 4. I have no idea what your DOM looks like 5. What on earth do callbacks have to do with this?
[06:57:27] <hellyeah> i guess open event
[06:58:03] <hellyeah> after clicking button
[06:58:07] <hellyeah> dialog will pop up
[06:58:14] <hellyeah> and i will see table inside dialog
[06:58:28] <hellyeah> tthats all
[07:00:33] <Woet> hellyeah: everything you say is pure non-sense
[07:00:51] <hellyeah> why is that?
[07:01:05] <Woet> i don't know, probably because you don't have a clue?
[07:01:12] <Woet> it's hard to formulate a question when you're not sure what you're doing
[07:01:13] <thykka> hellyeah, http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#intro
[07:01:40] <hellyeah> come on man
[07:01:44] <hellyeah> it is really obvious
[07:01:48] <thykka> to you, perhaps
[07:01:49] <hellyeah> may be mistake is yours
[07:01:57] <hellyeah> i just wanna show table inside dialog
[07:01:57] <thykka> none of that is translated through your messages
[07:02:00] <hellyeah> thats really clear
[07:02:11] <hellyeah> what part of the intension did you now understand
[07:02:12] <thykka> ok, so what is the problem?
[07:02:23] <Woet> when two different people don't understand you, the issue is most likely on your side
[07:02:24] <hellyeah> you really dont understand that
[07:02:31] <hellyeah> unbeliviable
[07:02:36] <hellyeah> i believe you guys are bored
[07:02:49] <Woet> sen ne hos adamsin yav
[07:02:50] <thykka> you've stated your intent, but not 1. how you've tried to solve it 2. what went wrong
[07:03:05] <thykka> nor have you shared a line of code, like i asked earlier
[07:03:57] <thykka> there's a million different ways to do what you're describing. Should we start trying them one-by-one until after three hours we find the one that matches your requirements?
[07:04:20] <thykka> because guessing requirements is fun, right?
[07:07:05] <hellyeah> kes lan Woet
[07:07:24] <hellyeah> thykka,  i am trying to use open event now
[07:07:36] <hellyeah> i can iterate my object and construct a table
[07:08:02] <thykka> is that event from some 3rd party API/library?
[07:08:03] <hellyeah> inside open event
[07:08:14] <hellyeah> jquery ui dialog event
[07:08:24] <hellyeah> https://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#event-open
[07:09:27] <thykka> okay, and you have the JSON loaded into a variable somewhere?
[07:09:33] <hellyeah> yes
[07:09:43] <hellyeah> i did ajax request that returns data
[07:09:43] <thykka> and you want to traverse that JSON somehow..?
[07:09:53] <hellyeah> with .each i assume
[07:10:03] <thykka> your assumption is better than anyone else's
[07:10:10] <thykka> only you've seen the structure here
[07:10:55] <thykka> each is generally for arrays, is there an array in the JSON?
[07:11:29] <hellyeah> object.each(function(index, element){ $('<th>' + object(element)
[07:11:33] <hellyeah> smt simiklar to aht
[07:11:46] <hellyeah> i suppose you can use each for object also
[07:11:50] <thykka> not like that
[07:11:51] <hellyeah> let me check it
[07:12:13] <thykka> and even if you could, you probably shouldn't
[07:12:38] <hellyeah> for table?
[07:12:43] <thykka> what if there's something in the JSON you didn't expect?
[07:13:03] <hellyeah> well that can be the case
[07:13:06] <thykka> you're gonna just show it in the frontend anyway?
[07:13:09] <hellyeah> but i did good validation job
[07:13:21] <hellyeah> you cannot send unexpected thing whatsoever
[07:14:05] <hellyeah> dont understand what happened
[07:15:55] <hellyeah> $.each(obj, function(index element)
[07:16:05] <thykka> you can iterate through an object's keys with var keys = Object.keys(yourObject); keys.each(function(key, index) { yourObject[key] });
[07:16:19] <thykka> note that some older IEs don't support Object.keys
[07:16:45] <thykka> uh.. keys.forEach()
[07:17:16] <thykka> or why not $.each(keys, function(i, key){ yourObject[key] })
[07:17:50] <hellyeah>       open: function (event) {
[07:17:50] <hellyeah>                     $.each(monitordata, function (index, element) {
[07:17:50] <hellyeah>                       $(event.target).text(element);
[07:17:50] <hellyeah>                     })
[07:17:50] <hellyeah>                 }
[07:17:52] <hellyeah> ops
[07:17:54] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:18:23] <hellyeah> that is way to go it seems http://dpaste.com/1FM288S
[07:38:22] <senaps> https://jsfiddle.net/ddg55oje/ this code is called with different objects, checks if object's name is in a list, if not, add's it to list and if is added, increases the count of that name by 1. but, it's adding each name only one time. what am i doing wrong?
[07:39:22] <senaps> i get a list of [china, china, india, china, korea] if a list of object is passed with the names specified.... it should give back [china, india, korea]
[08:00:40] <Levin^> for some weird reason, my slider is duplicating the images when the left/right buttons are clicked
[08:00:43] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/releases/impulsionada-pelo-evento-grand-depart-dusseldorf-2017-a-capital-estadual-dusseldorf-segue-rumo-ao-ano-esportivo-de-2018-e-talvez-o-campeonato-europeu-de-2024/
[08:01:40] <Levin^> my jquery: http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js
[08:02:10] <Levin^> lines 114 and 156
[08:15:03] <Levin^> is it appending every time I click on it?
[08:53:55] <hellyeah> $('.PIDColumn').append('<td class="level">' + element.PID + '</td></tr>') I am appending elements to some place like that i want to assign a class part of the name of class is dynamical value. How can accompolist that?
[08:54:10] <Woet> by putting a variable there just like element.PID?
[08:55:09] <hellyeah> that would be '<td class="level updatablefield" + i>'
[08:55:11] <hellyeah> ?
[08:55:34] <Woet> try it.
[08:55:45] <Woet> if it doesn't work it's time to learn about basic javascript
[08:55:56] <Woet> specifically strings and variables
[08:56:19] <hellyeah> .attr("class", "something" +1) would work
[08:56:30] <Woet> see above.
[08:56:42] <hellyeah> Woet, i know that subject
[08:57:27] <hellyeah>    $('.PIDColumn').append('<td class="level updatablefield ' + 1 + '">' + element.PID + '</td></tr>') +
[08:57:31] <hellyeah> that should work
[08:57:48] <Woet> good to know
[08:57:59] <hellyeah> Woet,
[08:58:04] <hellyeah> your attitude
[08:58:12] <hellyeah> does not fit psilosophy of freenode
[08:58:25] <hellyeah> help me or give up conversating me
[08:58:48] <Woet> let's hope it fits the philosophy at least
[08:59:09] <Woet> unfortunately without payment you don't get to demand what i do
[08:59:24] <hellyeah> Woet, you dont have to help me
[08:59:27] <hellyeah> dont piss me off
[08:59:32] <Woet> i'm quite aware i don't have to
[08:59:37] <hellyeah> lots of people here helping
[08:59:40] <Woet> but thanks for reminding me
[08:59:43] <hellyeah> Woet,  you are off topic now
[08:59:53] <Woet> at least i didn't start it
[09:00:01] <hellyeah> put a spin on your *ss okey
[09:00:08] <Woet> no thanks
[09:00:15] <hellyeah> okey
[09:00:19] <hellyeah> you are ignored
[09:00:24] <Woet> alright
[09:03:55] <hellyeah> i did it

[09:44:34] <Levin^> hi
[09:44:35] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZvrJxQ?editors=0010
[09:45:16] <Levin^> I cant put $tabSerialized inside .attr, right
[09:45:52] <Levin^> how do I serialize an ID?
[09:46:49] <Cork> an id is a string by definition
[09:47:31] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[09:48:28] <Levin^> I'm making a menu accordeon
[09:48:54] <Levin^> but my html won't be able to be edited manually
[09:49:11] <Levin^> so I'm adding more elements via jquery, like <input> and <label>
[09:49:19] <Levin^> they need to have an unique ID
[09:49:30] <Levin^> so I'm trying to serialize .attr
[09:49:40] <Cork> serialize attr??
[09:49:45] <Levin^> err
[09:50:02] <Cork> what your doing is looking for tab- elements and serialize there values to a param string
[09:50:06] <Levin^> I mean, each ID being unique, so tab-1, tab-2, etc
[09:50:08] <Cork> and then set that as an id for a new input
[09:50:31] <Cork> your selector won't find tab-1 elements
[09:50:38] <Cork> and i suspect your not using <tab-1>
[09:51:01] <Levin^> <input id="tab-1"
[09:51:12] <Cork> that would be $('#tab-1')
[09:51:18] <Cork> not $('tab-')
[09:51:39] <Cork> if you want to select them as a group use a class
[09:51:48] <Levin^> then I'd need to add a number, because it will loop
[09:52:02] <Cork> <input id="tab-1" class="tabs">
[09:52:11] <Levin^> do I need to make it inside an .each function?
[09:52:25] <Cork> i'm still not sure what you're trying to do
[09:52:34] <Cork> how is serialize() suppose to help here?
[09:52:59] <Levin^> I'm newbie. I searched for serialize, then google told me that function, so I'm trying it
[09:53:13] <Levin^> if it's wrong, I won't be using
[09:53:33] <Cork> it depends on what you rant to serialize
[09:53:45] <Cork> hence my question
[09:53:45] <Levin^> tab-1, tab-2, etc
[09:53:59] <Cork> and tab-1 and tab-2 would be what?
[09:54:12] <Levin^> each menu item that would appear
[09:54:28] <Levin^> they need to have an input, for each item
[09:54:44] <Cork> ok, i think i told you this last time too; provide the html needed to understand the code you provide
[09:54:44] <Levin^> I'm inserting them via jquery, because html can't be edited
[09:55:13] <Cork> currently you are selecting <tab-> elements in the page and create a checkbox and set the form values from those elements as a serialized id
[09:55:21] <Cork> so the code makes very little sense
[09:55:41] <Cork> also $liSelector.ready isn't even valid
[09:56:21] <Levin^> it's supposed to run when that selection is present
[09:56:30] <Cork> what selector
[09:56:47] <Cork> again provide something that ppl can read to understand what you instead to do
[09:56:54] <Cork> what you share makes very very little sense
[09:57:27] <Levin^> my page is this one: http://34.234.87.242/press-releases/
[09:57:44] <Levin^> the left sidebar is the one that will have an accordeon
[09:57:53] <Cork> just provide the html section that matters for the snippet you codepened
[10:09:18] <Levin^> my current HTML code resembles this: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZvrJxQ?editors=1010
[10:09:50] <Levin^> I need to implement this accordeon, since it's simpler to do in CSS
[10:09:52] <Levin^> https://codepen.io/raubaca/pen/PZzpVe
[10:09:58] <MassDebates> Howdy Levin^
[10:10:13] <Levin^> all the elements that are missing, I thought on adding via jquery
[10:10:19] <Levin^> hi MassDebates
[10:10:57] <MassDebates> Levin^, if you're looking to do a pure CSS slider, wouldn't you want to ask in #CSS ?
[10:11:10] <Levin^> no, it's not the case
[10:11:16] <Levin^> many elements aren't in my HTML
[10:11:31] <Levin^> I'd need to add it somehow
[10:11:43] <MassDebates> You want to add elements dynamically?
[10:11:46] <Levin^> yes
[10:12:32] <MassDebates> And you want it to have this functionality based upon pure CSS?
[10:12:42] <MassDebates> Do you need help adding the elements?
[10:13:04] <Levin^> yes
[10:13:28] <Levin^> on this pen, I commented my code: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZvrJxQ?editors=1010
[10:13:43] <Levin^> somebody here told me it's not very well written
[10:14:17] <Levin^> what I'm doing is adding the elements that are missing in my code
[10:15:04] <MassDebates> I'm not sure how to go about helping you.
[10:15:22] <MassDebates> Yes, you can dynamically add elements with javascript (and jquery by extension)
[10:15:29] <MassDebates> jquery simplifies it pretty well tbh
[10:15:39] <MassDebates> But I'm not sure what I can provide that would help you.
[10:15:53] <MassDebates> There's examples available so mine would be pretty redundant.
[10:15:54] <MassDebates> Here's a link
[10:16:41] <MassDebates> http://api.jquery.com/append/ This is what I would use
[10:16:54] <MassDebates> To append an element. You'd probably append an item to your list if you were using list items
[10:17:27] <MassDebates> Or, if you were using radio buttons and checkboxes (the input-based accordion that is pure-css in regards to activating certain tabs/sections of the accordion) then you'd append those elements.
[10:17:46] <MassDebates> Radio buttons would have to be added with the right attributes to have them match the rest of the accordion they blong in.
[10:17:49] <MassDebates> belong*
[10:18:01] <MassDebates> You'll need to select the right element to append to, as well.
[10:18:15] <MassDebates> I'm not sure what you have planned for triggering or actuating the changes, though
[10:19:17] <Levin^> I'm updating yet more my code, but would you care to look my live site to have some clue?
[10:19:25] <MassDebates> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion this may be of use to you, as well.
[10:20:25] <MassDebates> By the way, good news about this - if you add any elements, they'll automagically take the styling you've already set for the previous ones. You'll just need to make sure they are applicable for the same selectors (like classes etc)
[10:22:08] <Levin^> my site is in wordpress. do you think I should be remaking an accordeon by hand like I'm doing, or using another easier method?
[10:22:25] <MassDebates> http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/#added-ability-to-add-remove-panels Also this.
[10:22:38] <MassDebates> Levin^,  I have no idea. That largely depends on context and the application
[10:22:45] <MassDebates> Levin^,  You'll have to decide that for yourself!
[10:23:03] <Levin^> I see lol
[10:23:12] <Levin^> I wanted to insist yet more on my code
[10:23:16] <MassDebates> Usually, if the theme was made well, there's already some features that may help you with this.
[10:23:38] <MassDebates> Levin^, you should explore your theme's documentation, if any, or possibly any demo sites that show your theme with a possible shortcodes page.
[10:32:07] <undefined_bob> why does it say "id is not defined"? https://codepen.io/undefined999/pen/VyyQVw
[10:32:29] <taplar> cause it's not
[10:32:34] <undefined_bob> I worked today on this little script but it still doesnt work
[10:32:46] <undefined_bob> but thats mean, it should be defined
[10:32:58] <taplar> nope
[10:33:05] <taplar> something isn't defined until you define it
[10:33:11] <taplar> where are you defining id?
[10:33:39] <undefined_bob> id = id.replace( value, ""); I thought that would define it
[10:33:58] <taplar> new thing = nonexistant thing.replace( ... )
[10:34:06] <undefined_bob> ow
[10:34:07] <taplar> ...
[10:38:50] <undefined_bob> I have no idea how to define it the way it target what I think I need. thanks for your help taplar I'll try more tomorrow
[10:39:21] <taplar> i mean you're trying to change some string.  i'm just not sure what that string is
[10:40:03] <undefined_bob> the script should replace invalid characters in the id of the div
[10:40:26] <taplar> which div?
[10:40:36] <undefined_bob> like making <a id="2our$ / team/2$" to id="our_team"
[10:40:50] <undefined_bob> in the pen the two in the html section
[10:40:56] <taplar> uh, why are you generating html like that in the first place?
[10:41:12] <undefined_bob> thats complicated
[10:41:51] <undefined_bob> its because the id is equal to the user input of the headline of each box
[10:42:12] <undefined_bob> and the user can enter anything of course
[10:42:24] <taplar> so why not clense the data on the server side?
[10:42:26] <undefined_bob> user is = the guy who maintain the page later
[10:42:41] <undefined_bob> because its in offline cms I'm forced to use
[10:43:06] <taplar> ok, so ignoring that for now, you're wanting it to replace it with our_Team?
[10:43:14] <undefined_bob> yes
[10:43:21] <taplar> even though something else already has that id
[10:43:43] <undefined_bob> like stripping out all invalid characters which are not allowed in ids
[10:43:57] <taplar> mainly spaces are not allowed
[10:44:04] <taplar> i'm not aware of much else that is invalid
[10:44:14] <undefined_bob> no no it must be the same word or words which was original in the id
[10:44:42] <taplar> so the pastebin is just an example.  that first div with the id as our_Team already won't be there?
[10:44:45] <undefined_bob> so I would hvae to read the characters, strip out everything invalid and write the valid version of the word back
[10:44:51] <undefined_bob> yes
[10:44:59] <undefined_bob> its just an example
[10:45:05] <undefined_bob> it could be everything
[10:45:25] <taplar> so you're going to want to select anything that has an id, and then "fix" it
[10:45:34] <undefined_bob> basically yes
[10:45:45] <taplar> $('[id]') will get you everything with an id attribute
[10:46:15] <taplar> then you can each() over those and do whatever

[10:48:07] <undefined_bob> thank you taplar I'm going to try that tomorrow. for now I have to leave the office, work is over for today :)
[10:48:07] <undefined_bob> thank you very much
[10:48:08] <undefined_bob> and see you maybe tomorrow
[10:48:17] <taplar> sure
[10:48:34] <undefined_bob> thanks, good bye :)
[12:03:57] <hellyeah> yo
[13:03:04] <dimi1947> I have this code that gets the values of checked inputs and passes them to an array..the problem is that outside the function the values are not all accessed with in the aray,see for yourself:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/n04odgff/66/
[13:04:16] <dimi1947> I have tried returning the array from the function but to no avail
[13:04:31] <taplar> what does line 3 do?
[13:06:39] <dimi1947> create a new array
[13:06:43] <taplar> when?
[13:07:23] <dimi1947> what do you mean when?...I suppose that time it is parsed
[13:07:33] <taplar> read your logic.  when does that happen
[13:08:30] <dimi1947> an array is created when it is declared...
[13:08:43] <taplar> when?
[13:09:02] <dimi1947> in line 3 it is the declaration
[13:09:12] <taplar> and when does that execute?
[13:10:00] <dimi1947> I do not understand what are you trying to say
[13:10:09] <taplar> again, read your logic
[13:10:18] <taplar> that statement isn't by itself
[13:10:23] <taplar> there is logic around it
[13:10:34] <taplar> what is going on?  when does the statement happen?
[13:10:47] <taplar> what's the context?
[13:10:49] <dimi1947> hmmmm
[13:11:13] <dimi1947> an array is created on top of the other
[13:11:21] <taplar> :o
[13:11:30] <taplar> problem?
[13:12:48] <dimi1947> how am I going to pass the values into an array without one array overwritting the other
[13:12:50] <dimi1947> ?
[13:13:21] <taplar> maybe create the array outside the loop?
[13:14:02] <dimi1947> certainly...but the values are available inside the loop...and somehow I must make them available outside of it
[13:14:11] <hellyeah> i am using data-field
[13:14:11] <robertmaxrees> why not use a map?
[13:14:16] <taplar> if the problem is repeatedly creating an array...... don't repeat it
[13:14:20] <hellyeah> this one give me undfine var $class = $(event.target).data('field');
[13:14:21] <hellyeah>             console.log($class);
[13:14:35] <hellyeah> why???
[13:14:42] <dimi1947> can you reminde me the usage of map in this case?
[13:15:09] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/n04odgff/71/
[13:15:12] <ElDiabolo> Hi. I am working on an application that is using an automplete plugin that is outdated and modified. What is the best way to use a more modern autocomplete on some pages while keeping the existing one?
[13:15:34] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah if there's no data-field, that'll be undefined.
[13:15:37] <taplar> dimi1947: you can push to an array inside the loop
[13:15:37] <taplar> yeah, i was going to suggest map after he figures this out
[13:15:48] <robertmaxrees> ah.  sorry D:
[13:15:52] <hellyeah> there is data-field
[13:16:07] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah dunno then buddy.  make sure your selector is good.
[13:16:25] <dimi1947> thx
[13:16:38] <taplar> dimi1947: get the array figured out?
[13:16:55] <dimi1947> what do you mean?
[13:17:10] <hellyeah>  $('.sapColumn').append('<td class="level updatablefield' + "SC" + classid + '">' + element.SAP + '<br />' + '<button class="editMonitor" data-field="updatablefieldSC' + classid + '">' + '<i class=" fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>' + '</button>' + '<button class="deleteMonitor" data-field="updatablefieldSC' + classid + '">' + '<i class=" fa fa-trash-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>' + '<button class="approveMonitor" data-field="updatablefie
[13:17:10] <hellyeah> ldSC' + classid + '">' + '<i class=" fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></button>' + '</td></tr>');
[13:17:14] <taplar> you said thx so i thought you figured out your issue
[13:17:16] <hellyeah> data-field is here
[13:17:56] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah don't paste in the channel.
[13:18:03] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[13:18:09] <hellyeah> sure okey sorry
[13:18:12] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees solution helped
[13:18:27] <hellyeah> it didnt get data-field
[13:18:30] <hellyeah> what the heck
[13:18:45] <taplar> dimi1947: but do you know how to fix the non-map version?
[13:19:13] <dimi1947> no...do you think it is important to learn that too?
[13:19:18] <hellyeah> i am really frasturated right
[13:19:20] <hellyeah> now
[13:19:21] <taplar> i do
[13:19:27] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah make a fiddle duder.
[13:19:30] <robertmaxrees> we can help if you do that.
[13:19:33] <taplar> it's showing a deficiency in a part of your js understanding
[13:19:47] <taplar> if you leave it like that, you're bound to repeat it
[13:21:25] <taplar> i would definitely use the map in the final version, but i think it's important you understand why the previous one didn't work and how to fix it
[13:21:34] <dimi1947> taplar:ok give me some help...how I could do it with an array...the array must be created outside the loop...but how I will make available the values outside the loop
[13:22:09] <taplar> ok, so you can create the array right before the loop, no?
[13:23:09] <taplar> and currently, you are creating the array in side the loop, and it's available outside the loop, no?
[13:24:25] <taplar> why were you able to do that?
[13:24:36] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/4p2ahox2/3/
[13:24:48] <dimi1947> I am assuming you mean this...
[13:26:48] <dimi1947> give me a minute...
[13:28:28] <taplar> stupid network.  did you see my fiddle paste?
[13:29:38] <dimi1947> no
[13:29:51] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ss4vnyqb/  why does the first one work?
[13:33:50] <dimi1947> I suppose you are asking me
[13:33:59] <taplar> yup
[13:37:48] <dimi1947> me2 is undefined...it is not global
[13:38:07] <taplar> boom
[13:38:22] <hellyeah> that must be joke
[13:38:34] <hellyeah> got correct result in jsfiddle
[13:38:37] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah did you make a fiddle for your issue?
[13:38:45] <taplar> so in your problem, the array declaration in the loop worked outside the loop because it was global
[13:38:45] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us?
[13:38:57] <hellyeah> yeah
[13:38:58] <dimi1947> taplar:neither the first one works
[13:39:11] <taplar> dimi1947: i'm just trying to demonstrate scope rules with my fiddle
[13:39:22] <hellyeah> issue is on my local https://jsfiddle.net/23r7dve4/2/
[13:39:24] <taplar> to address your concern with declaring the array outside the loop
[13:39:33] <hellyeah> just click the first button i sap column
[13:39:53] <robertmaxrees> woah./
[13:39:54] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:39:55] <hellyeah> doesnt work in my local
[13:39:57] <hellyeah> what
[13:40:06] <taplar> variables made at once scope will be available in lower scopes
[13:40:14] <dimi1947> I am aware of variable scope...it had nothing to do with the problem...if I rememeber
[13:40:16] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using locally hellyeah
[13:40:20] <taplar> but variables in lower scopes will only be available in higher scopes if they are global
[13:40:26] <hellyeah> let me check
[13:40:36] <hellyeah> 2.2.4
[13:40:45] <dimi1947> taplar:what do you mean by saying lower/higher scope?
[13:40:46] <hellyeah> is it about that?
[13:40:46] <taplar> ok, so if you are aware of that, then declaring it before the loop shouldn't pose any concern with you
[13:41:14] <taplar> function(){  /*scope1*/   function(){  /*scope2, nested "lower" scope */ } }
[13:41:32] <dimi1947> ok...I got it
[13:41:34] <taplar> everything in scope1 can be accessed by scope2 without passing it to the method
[13:41:50] <dimi1947> ...if it golbal
[13:41:52] <taplar> but if variables in scope 2 are declared with var, they will not be available in scope1
[13:41:53] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  anything ?
[13:42:02] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah https://jsfiddle.net/23r7dve4/3/ does this show the bug?
[13:42:09] <robertmaxrees> calm down duder - i have a job too ;)
[13:42:19] <dimi1947> taplar:yes...
[13:42:37] <hellyeah> sorry
[13:42:38] <hellyeah> :D
[13:42:39] <taplar> k, just making sure we're good there, :)
[13:43:08] * taplar has declared '18 the year of debugging and making sure people understand stuff
[13:43:18] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  showed the class
[13:43:29] <dimi1947> taplar:question if variables in higher scope are declared with var...are they available in lower scope?
[13:43:35] <taplar> yep
[13:43:36] <hellyeah> gave me what i want
[13:43:49] <taplar> var keeps the variables from being global
[13:43:59] <hellyeah> dimi1947,  people use const let novadays
[13:44:00] <taplar> but they are available in it's own scope, and nested scopes
[13:44:08] <dimi1947> taplar:got it
[13:44:08] <hellyeah> scope issue of var is kinda complicated one
[13:44:25] <taplar> hellyeah: don't you have an issue of your own to focus on, :P
[13:44:35] <hellyeah> xD
[13:44:42] <hellyeah> it was just showdown .D
[13:44:43] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah so what's happening on your local?
[13:44:53] <hellyeah> got undefined
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> so then there's a difference between your local and the fiddle.
[13:45:19] <hellyeah> i have same code and in local i got undefined
[13:45:23] <dimi1947> taplar:so...where are we now?
[13:45:50] <hellyeah> i got that from my code
[13:45:56] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah erm.
[13:45:59] <taplar> so you understand you could just declare the array outside the loop, push to the array in the each, and it would be available how you were trying to use it, right?
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> then your local is different.
[13:46:36] <hellyeah> are you serious when you wrote that :D
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> 100%
[13:47:10] <robertmaxrees> on your local, go to the console
[13:47:18] <dimi1947> taplar:are you trying to say something?
[13:47:45] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ss4vnyqb/2/
[13:47:54] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah then do $('.editMonitor').length
[13:47:57] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[13:48:22] <hellyeah> let me see
[13:49:43] <dimi1947> taplar:obviously the 2nd is correct...I am trying to remember what I was doing wrong
[13:49:53] <taplar> you were doing the first example
[13:50:21] <taplar> the second one is the fix
[13:50:29] <hellyeah> 13,26,39..
[13:50:36] <dimi1947> ys
[13:50:43] <hellyeah> what is that?
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[13:51:15] <dimi1947> taplar:I think with map is a little bit more complicated...this is simpler...
[13:51:23] <hellyeah> i dont understand that
[13:51:32] <taplar> map is actually simplier, because it does exactly this, just for you
[13:51:33] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah that's the number of elements that match that selector.
[13:51:46] <taplar> map is a implementation of this boilerplating
[13:51:48] <hellyeah> 13,26,39,52,65,78
[13:51:56] <hellyeah> uh
[13:52:06] <hellyeah> okay
[13:52:18] <hellyeah> yesh table has 13 column thats normal
[13:52:40] <dimi1947> thanks!!!
[13:52:46] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ss4vnyqb/3/
[13:52:54] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah show me exactly what you're doing.
[13:53:07] <taplar> little different since it's the Array.prototype.map vs the jQuery.fn.map, but they function the same
[13:54:13] <hellyeah> let me share my whole js code robertmaxrees
[13:54:30] <dimi1947> taplar:what are you showing me now?
[13:54:40] <taplar> look at the bottom, i added a map version
[13:54:52] <dimi1947> taplar:I saw it
[13:55:02] <hellyeah> this is what i am doing
[13:55:04] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:55:07] <hellyeah> in that fiddle
[13:55:18] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah something isn't adding up.
[13:55:24] <robertmaxrees> that .length call doesn't make any sense.
[13:55:47] <robertmaxrees> did you do that via your console or did you put that into your code somewhere?
[13:55:50] <dimi1947> thanks
[13:55:59] <taplar> np
[13:56:58] <hellyeah> i didnt do anything with console actually
[13:57:09] <hellyeah> i can give you teamviewer
[13:57:13] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah duder
[13:57:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:57:15] <hellyeah> you can take a look if you want
[13:57:20] <hellyeah> :D
[13:57:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:57:33] <robertmaxrees> no teamviewer.
[13:57:47] <hellyeah> i dont have any expectation like that
[13:57:56] <hellyeah> dont worry about it
[13:58:01] <robertmaxrees> wait
[13:58:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:58:12] <hellyeah> i am waiting
[13:58:18] <robertmaxrees> dude
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> dome of these buttons have data-field on them and some of them don't
[13:58:40] <hellyeah> code is 730 lines
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> in your js.
[13:58:50] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:58:52] <hellyeah> what
[13:59:03] <taplar> whomp whomp
[13:59:11] <hellyeah> WHAT
[13:59:14] <hellyeah> damn
[13:59:15] <hellyeah> my eyes
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> your code is a mess heh
[13:59:22] <hellyeah> i hate this eyesight problem
[13:59:48] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  i just did example
[13:59:54] <hellyeah> SAP has that classes
[14:00:04] <hellyeah> i am just trying it works or nor
[14:00:06] <hellyeah> not
[14:00:34] <taplar> $(selectorForThingsThatShouldHaveDataField).not('[data-field]').length
[14:01:36] <hellyeah> that class is just in SAP column right now
[14:01:58] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you sure ALL SAP columns have it?>
[14:01:58] <hellyeah> well i screwed
[14:02:21] <hellyeah> i have three buttons editButton, deleteButton, approveButton
[14:02:29] <hellyeah> all must have that
[14:02:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/23r7dve4/4/
[14:02:40] <hellyeah> if i am not mistaken
[14:02:46] <taplar> according to that selector based on what robert said, they don't
[14:04:45] <hellyeah> button has datafield i see that
[14:04:47] <taplar> i'd almost recommend a template here
[14:04:59] <taplar> that's a lot of html in the js
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[14:06:46] <hellyeah> '<button class="editMonitor" data-field="updatablefieldSC
[14:07:08] <hellyeah> i am confused
[14:07:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:07:38] <taplar> that's not the only instance of editMonitor being appended
[14:07:58] <taplar> Ctrl+F
[14:08:25] <hellyeah> okey
[14:08:27] <hellyeah> i solved it
[14:08:34] <hellyeah> that is so silly
[14:08:42] <taplar> why?
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[14:09:01] <hellyeah> i tried chrome or edge
[14:09:13] <hellyeah> they dont know $(event.target)
[14:09:19] <taplar> lol
[14:09:20] <taplar> dude
[14:09:32] <hellyeah> with $(this) i got result
[14:09:40] <hellyeah> weird thing it worked in jsfiddle
[14:09:41] <taplar> you remember me saying yesterday about being confused when you jump from one thing to another?
[14:09:45] <hellyeah> so my local is fucked up
[14:10:20] <hellyeah> $(event.target) means $(this) right taplar
[14:10:37] <taplar> robert is helping you right now.  but you're jumping from place to place again
[14:11:00] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[14:11:07] <hellyeah> i just solved the problem
[14:11:09] <taplar> we pointed out an issue with the buttons
[14:11:12] <hellyeah> not it worked
[14:11:30] <taplar> and you started talking about the events
[14:11:45] <taplar> :|
[14:11:48] <hellyeah> taplar,  i solved the problem this is what i am saying
[14:11:49] <hellyeah> xD
[14:11:52] <hellyeah> i am sorry
[14:11:58] <hellyeah> i just needed to mention that
[14:12:07] <hellyeah> yes i need template
[14:12:13] <robertmaxrees> >.> so it's been working this entire time?
[14:12:37] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  with $(event.target) it gave me undefined
[14:12:47] <hellyeah> with $(this) gave me correct result
[14:12:54] <hellyeah> i dont know how to interpret that
[14:13:01] <hellyeah> seems it worked and works
[14:13:22] <hellyeah> but i dont know how and why $(event.target) failed
[14:13:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:13:45] <robertmaxrees> becuase event.target is the element that initiated the event.
[14:13:48] <hellyeah> dont lol to me :D
[14:13:56] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the element that the handler was bound to.
[14:13:57] <hellyeah> someone said to me
[14:14:14] <hellyeah> use $(event.target) instead of $(this)
[14:14:20] <hellyeah> so it was false suggestion?
[14:14:26] <robertmaxrees> back up
[14:14:29] <robertmaxrees> why did they suggest that?
[14:15:23] <hellyeah> well i dont remember exactly
[14:15:34] <hellyeah> but function take event parameter
[14:15:44] <hellyeah> oh
[14:15:46] <hellyeah> remember
[14:15:58] <hellyeah> i have event(each like that
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:16:14] <hellyeah> an i was confused this keyword belong to loop or event
[14:16:35] <hellyeah> for distinguishing that using event.target is suggested
[14:16:44] <robertmaxrees> "i have event(each like that" - huh?
[14:16:52] <robertmaxrees> that sentence doesn't make sense heh
[14:17:48] <hellyeah> well
[14:18:16] <hellyeah> smt.on('click, function(){$.each(obj, function(index, element)
[14:19:03] <robertmaxrees> what is "obh" supposed to be there?
[14:19:07] <robertmaxrees> *obj
[14:20:11] <taplar> and just to be certain, because you said the event thing failed, and the example you gave isn't doing it.  In your code you are passing in the event on the event handler like this right?  .on('click', function(event) {
[14:21:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:21:41] <robertmaxrees> so confused.
[14:21:45] <hellyeah> obj is object
[14:21:48] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> riiight.  what object is it?  an element?
[14:22:05] <robertmaxrees> soemthign else?
[14:22:08] <hellyeah> yes taplar
[14:22:10] <hellyeah> no
[14:22:13] <hellyeah> not element
[14:22:24] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/5dg0yk1x/
[14:22:26] <hellyeah> {}
[14:22:45] <robertmaxrees> just so we're clear - literally nothing about this example explains why you were using event.target :)
[14:22:57] <taplar> i know we had a discussion the other day about $.each and objects
[14:23:10] <taplar> and you were doing something like {0:thing, 1:thing}
[14:23:13] <taplar> and we said to fix that
[14:23:22] <hellyeah> makeArray did that
[14:23:23] <hellyeah> :D
[14:23:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, he wasn't able to get entity framework to pump the data out in the right format.
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> and claimed that it needed to be done for the next day.
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:23:50] <taplar> but now we're back to using an object in $.each again
[14:24:04] <robertmaxrees> and also said that he promised to remove $.makeArray and actually send over properly formatted daya.
[14:24:04] <taplar> heh
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> *data
[14:29:59] <hellyeah> okay
[14:30:04] <hellyeah> i will do everything
[14:30:06] <hellyeah> but now
[14:30:15] <hellyeah> i need to go home
[14:30:15] <hellyeah> :D
[14:30:40] <Levin^> there's something weird happening to my slider
[14:30:42] <Levin^> http://34.234.87.242/releases/impulsionada-pelo-evento-grand-depart-dusseldorf-2017-a-capital-estadual-dusseldorf-segue-rumo-ao-ano-esportivo-de-2018-e-talvez-o-campeonato-europeu-de-2024/
[14:31:05] <Levin^> if you inspect the slider, you will notice duplicated elements
[14:31:34] <Levin^> I'm struggling to understand why that happens
[14:32:39] <hellyeah> i need help in one more issue
[14:34:43] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah just ask your question.
[14:34:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:23] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ where do you init the slider?
[14:36:40] <hellyeah> i am preparing a fiddle
[14:37:25] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: http://34.234.87.242/wp-content/themes/salient-child/js/scripts.js
[14:37:52] <Levin^> lines 110 and 152
[14:39:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:39:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not where it gets compiled to.
[14:39:28] <Levin^> oopd
[14:39:37] <Levin^> it's cached, a sec
[14:40:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting two matches for that file.
[14:41:18] <Levin^> ok, I disabled the cache, please try again
[14:42:24] <hellyeah> for fresh start http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3433/
[14:42:47] <hellyeah> 3433
[14:42:52] <hellyeah> what the hack
[14:43:04] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah what's the question?
[14:43:32] <hellyeah> question is
[14:43:41] <hellyeah> how can i get the key part of object
[14:43:49] <hellyeah> i really dont know i am searching for it
[14:43:57] <hellyeah> Object.keys(element)
[14:43:59] <hellyeah> ?
[14:44:01] <robertmaxrees> "the key part of object"?
[14:44:06] <robertmaxrees> could you provide some more context?
[14:44:25] <hellyeah> sure
[14:44:41] <hellyeah> var obj = {a : b}; here a is key b is value
[14:44:48] <hellyeah> key/value pair
[14:45:14] <hellyeah> right
[14:45:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/d6o7naxb/ hellyeah
[14:45:27] <robertmaxrees> so now what are you trying to do?
[14:46:04] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ my guess is that replacement script is duplicating things.
[14:46:19] <hellyeah> i just put table inside dialog
[14:46:21] <robertmaxrees> i would step throught hat.
[14:46:39] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah huh?
[14:46:53] <hellyeah> when i click the button
[14:46:59] <hellyeah> dialog will open
[14:47:08] <hellyeah> and there will be a table inside it
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> so you want the keyname for the object within the each?
[14:47:48] <hellyeah> there is thead and tbody
[14:48:08] <hellyeah> so thead is header i should show key in the header
[14:48:14] <hellyeah> and value in the body
[14:48:45] <hellyeah> hope you understand
[14:49:16] <taplar> "how do i get keys from object" turned into "i'm building a table"
[14:49:36] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3435/
[14:49:41] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: I'm trying to figure what part could be
[14:49:53] <hellyeah> taplar,  i just got the key now
[14:49:56] <hellyeah> check it out
[14:49:56] <Levin^> the .append maybe?
[14:50:28] <Levin^> is there some similar command I could use in its place?
[14:50:29] <taplar> why are you doing obj[index]
[14:50:31] <taplar> ?
[14:50:54] <hellyeah> i am sure i can do element
[14:50:59] <taplar> so...
[14:51:09] <hellyeah> just preference
[14:51:13] <hellyeah> i mean
[14:51:15] <taplar> so why pass element in?
[14:51:28] <hellyeah> it is just kind of hoby
[14:51:29] <hellyeah> :D
[14:51:36] <hellyeah> it may be bad hoby
[14:51:41] <taplar> it's confusing
[14:52:10] <hellyeah> yes
[14:52:15] <hellyeah> i get rid of that
[14:53:41] <hellyeah> btw append is correct method here http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3436/
[14:54:12] <taplar> look at your console
[14:56:18] <hellyeah> it is okey i guess
[14:56:26] <taplar> ?
[14:56:40] <taplar> "Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list" is ok?
[15:00:07] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[15:00:14] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3438/
[15:00:52] <taplar> what does your console say?
[15:01:11] <taplar> are you running your code with the console open?
[15:02:24] <hellyeah> tbody is not defined
[15:02:34] <hellyeah> oh
[15:02:51] <hellyeah> i hate typos
[15:03:03] <taplar> i would strongly suggest you check your console before asking in here about a problem dude
[15:03:20] <taplar> cause i'm just going to look at it, and tell you to look at it
[15:03:33] <hellyeah> at least i got smt :D
[15:03:38] <taplar> cut me out of that process, :)
[15:03:45] <hellyeah> taplar,  sorry
[15:03:52] <hellyeah> i am just tired and frasturated
[15:03:58] <hellyeah> wont be happen again promise
[15:03:59] <taplar> so maybe take a break?
[15:04:30] <hellyeah> five minuto
[15:04:48] <hellyeah> i am working on company
[15:05:06] <hellyeah> well
[15:05:24] <hellyeah> they hired indian company before me to get things done
[15:05:33] <hellyeah> i am just contributing software
[15:05:37] <hellyeah> i got my second wind now
[15:05:56] <taplar> your making simple mistakes and not catching them.  i would say a break is in order
[15:07:32] <hellyeah> yes
[15:12:50] <ronaldl93> Good evening guys
[15:13:00] <taplar> yo
[15:17:11] <hellyeah> one last question
[15:17:17] <hellyeah> what did i do wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3439/
[15:19:25] <hellyeah> Cannot read property 'createDocumentFragment' of undefined what is that
[15:19:50] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/6FGqN/3440/
[15:19:53] <taplar> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:20:22] <taplar> read over those slides, and apply what they say to your fiddle
[15:21:14] <hellyeah> it is 11 p.m. here
[15:21:24] <hellyeah> can you help me with that and i will read
[15:21:51] <taplar> so do so after you take a break
[15:21:51] <taplar> but it's high time you start learning about debugging
[15:22:01] <taplar> i want you to dig
[15:22:12] <hellyeah> i will dig i promise
[15:22:17] <hellyeah> anyway
[15:22:22] <Tom_2003> I need to change a class to another class, but there are no ID's to use. How can I achieve this? https://pastebin.com/Fm6SCBGs
[15:22:40] <hellyeah> taplar,  give me little bit help man i really stuck
[15:23:01] <hellyeah> or i am going
[15:23:03] <taplar> i can quickly tell you what the issue is -because- i'm doing what those slides talk about
[15:23:04] <taplar> you can learn to do the same
[15:23:21] <ronaldl93> Anyone who can assist with Autocomplete? Not sure what I'm doing wrong. Any ideas?
[15:23:22] <ronaldl93> http://jsbin.com/yalabucezo/edit?html,console,output
[15:23:26] <hellyeah> taplar,  i dont have much time unfortunately
[15:24:01] <taplar> read.  learn.
[15:24:11] <taplar> the more time you spend here asking me, the more time you could be reading
[15:25:14] <taplar> Tom_2003: you can select on a class, and then replace it
[15:25:31] <taplar> the selector is just to find the elements.  it doesn't mean that you can't change it after they are found
[15:25:43] <ronaldl93> jquery.min.js:4 GET http://local.test/ADB?term=feqr 404 (Not Found) (This is what I'm getting when I type something in the textbox)
[15:26:00] <hellyeah> i am going
[15:26:08] <taplar> take care then
[15:26:54] <Tom_2003> taplar: e.g. var myDivElement = $( "wdi_load_more_wrap" );   will work?
[15:27:07] <taplar> a class selector begins with a period
[15:27:18] <taplar> just like css
[15:27:18] <Tom_2003> var myDivElement = $( ".wdi_load_more_wrap" );  :)
[15:30:36] <mistergibson> Question: is there a compatible way to have JavaScript (NOT ELEMENTS) Objects with a Unique Object ID - that does not break jQuery.
[15:30:57] <mistergibson> this far all attempts to embed an id function have crashed jQuery
[15:30:59] <taplar> ronaldl93: i don't get a ping response from that domain
[15:31:29] <mistergibson> Question 2: Does jQuery have a mechanism that assigns unique IDs to JS Objects?
[15:31:57] <ronaldl93> @taplar it's my local host, you won't be able to access that domain.
[15:33:42] <taplar> stupid network.  if you replied to my statement i missed it
[15:40:50] <taplar> ah, apparently my question didn't log
[15:41:13] <taplar> mistergibson: what are you trying to do with assigning ids to objects?  an object with an id is like a nested object in another object
[15:42:12] <mistergibson> taplar: I need some way to id every object (coming from Ruby where all objects possess an id)
[15:42:31] <taplar> right, so that's like an object
[15:42:35] <mistergibson> yes
[15:42:39] <taplar> { id1: object, id2: object }
[15:42:52] <mistergibson> no, I don't think so
[15:42:57] <mistergibson> thanks anyways
[15:43:09] <taplar> then i'm confused what you are asking for
[15:43:46] <mistergibson> {a: "test"}.unique_id() === {b: "test"}.unique_id();
[15:44:34] <taplar> unique_id() being ?
[15:44:46] <mistergibson> something that does not yet exist
[15:44:57] <taplar> then this would be a ##javascript question
[15:45:08] <mistergibson> ah well - I have two solutions
[15:45:13] <mistergibson> both crash jQuery
[15:45:22] <mistergibson> they work, but crash jQuery - a jQuery issue
[15:45:29] <taplar> show us what you're doing?
[15:45:33] <mistergibson> sure
[15:45:35] <mistergibson> hold on
[15:46:13] <mistergibson> Solution One: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1997661/unique-object-identifier-in-javascript
[15:46:28] <mistergibson> Solution Two: http://blogs.perl.org/users/mauke/2010/08/javascript-adding-a-unique-id-to-every-object.html
[15:46:37] <mistergibson> jQuery freaks when I apply either
[15:47:03] <taplar> and how are you trying to use either of these with jQuery?  do you have a fiddle?
[15:47:30] <mistergibson> no fiddle sorry
[15:47:41] <mistergibson> I tried some stuff on my localhost server
[15:47:55] <taplar> i'd need a fiddle to be able to see the issue you are seeing
[15:48:05] <mistergibson> now, I've tried loading those *before* and *after* jQuery loads
[15:48:12] <mistergibson> right
[15:48:18] <mistergibson> let me see what I can do
[15:55:12] <jayjo> what's the easiest way to create a bootstrap card from json data? Mainly with appending/sibling elements and putting json data where it belongs. Is there a standard way to do it?
[16:00:38] <jayjo> for something like creating bootstrap cards for a few sections, is moustache overkill? Or is a solution like https://stackoverflow.com/a/11173866 ok?
[16:01:22] <mistergibson> taplar: I didn't know how to do jsfiddle right, but here is a gist of the results: https://gist.github.com/mistergibson/b89ce9b2ebaf988201e046344aeecff9
[16:01:34] <taplar> if you're only doing it for a limited use case, i'd say a template string with some replaces would work fine.  jayjo
[16:04:10] <taplar> mistergibson: is that before or after the jquery include, and i don't see in that gist a jquery method call
[16:04:19] <mistergibson> after
[16:04:32] <mistergibson> it is pretty much the same before as well
[16:04:42] <mistergibson> it just does NOT like it
[16:05:31] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zkc2t8r7/  i don't get an error
[16:05:41] <mistergibson> I'm using jQuery UI as well
[16:06:04] <mistergibson> so - I apply the unique_id code and attempt to move a dialog windoid - and it crashes
[16:06:23] <mistergibson> with that output
[16:06:56] <taplar> apparently jquery ui defines a uniqueId function itself
[16:07:03] <mistergibson> oh wow
[16:07:14] <taplar> so you're most likely hitting some sort of collision error
[16:07:22] <mistergibson> I didn't see that - I'd love to use it instead
[16:07:33] <mistergibson> I'll look into it - thanks for pointing that out
[16:07:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/zkc2t8r7/1/  i don't know what it's used for, but sure 'nuff
[16:08:38] <taplar> https://api.jqueryui.com/uniqueId/
[16:08:41] <mistergibson> well - that seems to be on elements where I'm dorking with JS objects themselves
[16:08:59] <taplar> eveything is an object, :)
[16:09:09] <taplar> for the most part
[16:09:32] <mistergibson> yeah, but they are different I'm finding
[16:09:44] <mistergibson> I know how to mess with elements - no worries
[16:10:01] <mistergibson> but JS objects proper - hrm - a tad nasty to deal with
[16:15:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/486odL20/
[16:29:07] <ElDiabolo> Hi. Is there a way to use the old jquery autocomplete and jquery.ui.autocomplete run side by side.
[16:29:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:32:00] <robertmaxrees> ElDiabolo what "old jquerry autocomplete"?
[16:34:15] <ElDiabolo> There is a deprecated jquery autocomplete plugin if I understood correctly.
[16:37:13] <ElDiabolo> I have a modified version of that in my application I can not with doable effort remove.
[16:37:47] <ElDiabolo> I would however like to use jquery.ui.autocomplete.
[16:51:56] <robertmaxrees> ElDiabolo if they get initialized differently, it should be fine.
[16:53:44] <ElDiabolo> How do I initialize them differently? Never had to do that.
[16:53:44] <robertmaxrees> unless they both use the same "name" on the jquery object.
[17:28:00] <hellyeah> yo
[17:28:14] <duch_kazatel> sup
[17:28:35] <hellyeah> cod,ng
[17:28:43] <hellyeah> what about you?
[17:29:02] <robertmaxrees> bit of coding.  bit of delegating.  bit of general stuff.
[17:31:16] <hellyeah> bit of coding and bit of resisting to sleep
[17:31:35] <hellyeah> i checked and i realized i didnt get proper sleep like 3 days
[17:32:21] <robertmaxrees> yoooo
[17:32:27] <robertmaxrees> gotta sleep more.
[17:32:29] <robertmaxrees> you'll get more done.
[17:33:28] <hellyeah> that is correct
[17:33:39] <hellyeah> the problem is i am refusing to sleep
[17:34:29] <robertmaxrees> why??
[17:36:57] <hellyeah> i dont know exact reason
[17:37:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:37:33] <robertmaxrees> "refusing" implies that you're actively tring not to, usually in response to someboyd telling you do.
[17:37:34] <robertmaxrees> *to
[17:39:27] <hellyeah> i dont know you understand my sentence but let me try
[17:39:36] <hellyeah> when i try to fall into sleep
[17:39:42] <hellyeah> i pull myself out
[17:40:13] <robertmaxrees> like, involuntarily?
[17:41:18] <hellyeah> yes
[17:41:25] <hellyeah> it is automatic
[17:41:40] <hellyeah> that is really bad experience
[17:42:48] <hellyeah> anyway
[17:43:06] <hellyeah> i am just glad to be abla to code
[17:43:16] <hellyeah> able*
[17:46:34] <robertmaxrees> that's a bummer.
[17:49:08] <hellyeah> bummer
[17:49:17] <hellyeah> how it is called the situtation
[17:49:31] <robertmaxrees> you mean what you're going through?
[17:50:17] <hellyeah> yeah
[17:52:30] <taplar> i'd assume it's stress based
[17:53:04] <taplar> you said you were out of work for 3 months?  and you just started a new job
[17:53:06] <robertmaxrees> ^ probably from overworking yourself.
[17:53:11] <taplar> that's a whole truck load of stress
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[17:54:15] <gambl0re> hi robert
[17:55:47] <gambl0re> you got a real attitude, you know that?
[17:56:01] <taplar> and on that note, night everyone
[18:03:21] <hellyeah> tapout,  6 months
[18:03:42] <hellyeah> anyway
[18:03:56] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees,  it was 6 months
[18:04:01] <robertmaxrees> what was?
[18:04:25] <hellyeah> out of work
[18:04:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[18:25:34] <gambl0re> robert is my friend. whoever disrespects him, im coming after you.
[19:20:56] <mistergibson> Question: I found out about $.guid and it looks like what I need, but - How do I set up Object.prototype such that it automatically sets a property to $.guid and then does a $guid++ to advance it?
[19:21:37] <mistergibson> when I attempt to add a function to Object.prototype jQuery UI crashes hard
[19:21:55] <mistergibson> Any brilliant ideas welcome
[19:24:04] <robertmaxrees> mistergibson it's generally a bad idea to modify prototypes you don't own - especially if they're part of the standard library.
[19:24:29] <mistergibson> robertmaxrees: understood - just not sure what to do
[19:24:37] <robertmaxrees> why do you need the guid?\
[19:24:47] <mistergibson> if I setup a 'property' it all is fine - no crash
[19:25:01] <mistergibson> I need the guid because I need unique ids
[19:25:12] <mistergibson> I am going to process some node trees
[19:25:19] <robertmaxrees> i would create your own variable to handle that.
[19:25:21] <mistergibson> and unique ids are damned handy
[19:25:38] <robertmaxrees> since the internal guid is really meant for live events and shouldn't be used for the DOM.
[19:25:50] <mistergibson> I'm not using for the dom
[19:25:56] <mistergibson> I'm using it for JS objects
[19:26:01] <robertmaxrees> same diff.
[19:26:03] <mistergibson> no
[19:26:05] <robertmaxrees> it's really meant for internal use.
[19:26:06] <mistergibson> not the same
[19:26:08] <mistergibson> at all
[19:26:09] <robertmaxrees> for jquery live events.
[19:26:16] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't rely on it :)
[19:26:20] <mistergibson> I see
[19:26:20] <robertmaxrees> why not just make your own var?
[19:26:27] <robertmaxrees> you'll break the reference anyway.
[19:26:38] <mistergibson> because I want it to be auto-set when an object is constructed
[19:26:50] <mistergibson> but I could just set a custom property now that I think of it
[19:26:50] <robertmaxrees> a particular kind of object, right?
[19:27:10] <mistergibson> doesn't look like JS supports what I want
[19:27:19] <mistergibson> so I'll have to work around it I think
[19:27:23] <robertmaxrees> i would go that route. either define your own class or use some kind of factory.
[19:27:28] <mistergibson> ok
[19:27:30] <robertmaxrees> but i wouldn't modify the core prototypes./
[22:19:50] <jayjo> if I select all of the selected checkboxes with jquery, and I have bound data with .data(), is there a way to return it as an array? the whole selection of data
[22:25:42] <hellyeah> iterate your object
[22:25:51] <hellyeah> ad check data attr one by one
[22:25:56] <hellyeah> and push it into array
