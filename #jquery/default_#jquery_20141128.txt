[01:09:46] <glontu> hi
[01:41:54] <DarsVaeda> if you hover and then move to "test" why does this behavior (blinking) occur? I thought mouseenter doesn't fire on children: http://jsfiddle.net/Lzhjn7s0/
[01:43:34] <Cork> DarsVaeda: it doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/Lzhjn7s0/1/
[01:43:36] <Cork> the gap does
[01:44:40] <Cork> and one where the correct element has the blue color :) http://jsfiddle.net/Lzhjn7s0/2/
[01:44:42] <DarsVaeda> yes but why does it blend in agan?
[01:44:57] <Cork> cause you manage to get over the span before it is display: none
[01:45:10] <Cork> so mouseenter triggers again
[01:45:25] <DarsVaeda> see this is the part I don't get
[01:45:33] <DarsVaeda> docu says it doesn't fire on children
[01:45:41] <Cork> yes from parent to children
[01:45:59] <Cork> parent and all children is considered equiv to one element
[01:46:20] <Cork> instead of hover parent > hover child (bubbles to parent) and so on for every level
[01:46:30] <Cork> DarsVaeda: just check if event.target == this
[01:46:30] <DarsVaeda> hmm okay
[01:46:34] <Cork> if you don't want the bubble
[01:46:49] <Cork> but not that will include the a tag
[01:47:36] <Cork> you could do $(this).children().addBack().is(event.target)
[01:47:46] <Cork> if you want to limit the bubble to one level
[01:48:14] <Cork> opps, i missed the delegation
[01:48:24] <Cork> so ya, my comment isn't true >_<
[01:49:20] <Cork> DarsVaeda: http://jsfiddle.net/Lzhjn7s0/3/
[01:51:48] <DarsVaeda> yes thanks :)
[01:53:00] <Cork> DarsVaeda: an alternative would be to move the span out of the link
[01:53:38] <JustMozzy> hey everyone
[01:53:41] <DarsVaeda> yeah that was my first thought too
[01:54:05] <JustMozzy> is there a way to have a window resize, so that the content width is in all browsers the same?
[01:55:50] <Cork> JustMozzy: only if you open a popup with window.open
[01:56:12] <Cork> or if the user disables the block for scripts access to browser window resize
[01:56:37] <Cork> (rather i know ie and firefox has this, not sure about chrome)
[01:56:54] <Cork> they might possibly not even offer the option
[01:57:46] <JustMozzy> Cork: let's say I the block for scripts is by default off, how can I ensure that the windows content width is in all browsers the same?
[01:58:23] <Cork> wow.. good question haven't touched this since the block was introduced over 10 years ago :)
[01:58:57] <Cork> window.outerHeight = px?
[01:59:08] <JustMozzy> Cork: thing is, I need it for selenium testing
[01:59:27] <Cork> http://mdn.beonex.com/en/DOM/window.resizeTo.html
[02:19:04] <hanmac1> hm i need to use Window scrollTo, but i have a problem to check if the window content is big enough for that ... is there a way to check that? Window innerHeight does not seems to work as i wanted
[03:03:09] <dragoonis> I'm looking for a javascript library that will turn my basic HTML forms into some pretty looking ones - what libraries are you folks using ?
[03:52:44] <farid> Hi there, is it possible to post data to new page without form using jquery
[03:53:45] <bacobart> farid, http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[03:58:31] <farid> thanks backobart
[04:01:34] <hanmac1> hey can i ask somehow how long a page is? i need to all scrollTo with values i got, but i only want to scroll when the second page is longer or equal than the first
[04:07:41] <nikio_> why doesnt this line work?
[04:07:42] <nikio_>   $content = $("<div>").append($input).append($input).append($input).append($input).append($button);
[04:08:02] <Sherafff> How can i trigger something if an ajax query take longer than 200ms
[04:08:06] <Sherafff> or any other delay
[04:11:20] <Eckyecky> Anyone an idea how to solve this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27148450/trying-to-use-croppic-net-and-make-it-a-dropzone-can-anyone-figure-this-out
[04:17:28] <root3d> so i am in a design dillema , i have some data from api , now i want to bring that data into html fields which generated dynamically by javascript . would using clone() would be a good idea , because i want to call click events on them also, how will i distinguish the generated elelments for click event ?
[04:19:36] <farid> is it possible for a button to work as a html Form submit button withouth the form
[04:20:39] <root3d> farid, that's self contradicting statement you are using.
[04:21:05] <root3d> if you don't have any data ,why would you want a form button , just have a simple button.
[04:21:13] <root3d> call .on click event
[04:21:23] <farid> i have a one big form doing some stuff. then i have another 5 buttons in it tht need to go some where else
[04:21:42] <root3d> so ?
[04:22:19] <farid> so there is one submit button for the form. that is saving data in the db. now there another button which when i click .. it needs to send some data to another page that is doing some search
[04:22:28] <farid> i think i am not being able to explain properly :)
[04:23:25] <farid> now the search page is accessed from someother forms as well.
[04:23:53] <farid> the action page for search is only taking post data.
[04:24:30] <farid> now i have been asked to do the same from an existing form.. that was meant to do simple save/update operations
[04:28:29] <root3d> farid, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14693758/passing-form-data-to-another-html-page

[04:30:41] <djlee> Hi all, been out of frontend dev for a couple of years and ive forgotten everything :P Whats the recommended way to attach a function to an event (i.e. click) then on page load, run that function once to set the default state. Is it $('#parent').on('click', '#child', func...).find('#child').trigger('click')  for example?
[04:31:56] <farid> thanks root, let me git it a go.
[04:34:48] <hanmac1> nikio_: hm you need to clone $input
[04:35:17] <nikio_> hanmac1, is this ok?
[04:35:18] <nikio_> http://jsfiddle.net/6ba230ko/
[04:36:06] <hanmac1> hm maybe i dont know it was only a suggestion, did you try it?
[04:38:08] <BinaryKitten> djlee - that's delegated clcik  do you need delegated? is the #child going to be replaced later
[04:38:10] <BinaryKitten> ?
[04:39:00] <djlee> BinaryKitten: nope, its just an anchor. Guessing i just need $("#anchorele").on("click", func..) then?
[05:01:19] <Unopoo> when calling .queue(), does it auto add the queued funciton to 'fx' queue?
[05:07:00] <Unopoo> and why must .dequeue() must be called if want the next line continue? I read the api doc on .dequeque() and .queque(), but can't understand
[05:07:59] <Unopoo> the more confusing one is the use of .queue( function ( next ) { next() } )
[05:25:22] <Unopoo> ok..., what a monologue
[05:27:23] <Duvdevan> hey
[05:27:25] <Duvdevan> anyone here?
[05:29:37] <nathaneltitane> hey
[05:30:43] <nathaneltitane> looking for some help in getting this script going...http://jsfiddle.net/uvag4kLv/3/ : clocking on the load-more unhides the .hidden divs, but i'd also like it to scroll to that newly revealed div... how do i go about in doing that...
[05:45:28] <nathaneltitane> got it to scroll, but it only functions with the first unhidden element: http://jsfiddle.net/uvag4kLv/4/
[06:13:05] <Unopoo> nathaneltitane: see the changed version:http://jsfiddle.net/uvag4kLv/7/
[06:15:48] <nikio_> how can i make sure that var $input = $("<div><span /><input /></div>"),
[06:15:58] <nikio_> span has a class attribute?
[06:21:26] <Unopoo> nikio_: what do you mean by 'make sure'? do you mean you want to test if it has a class or not, or do you mean you want to add a class to it?
[06:21:44] <nikio_> add Unopoo .. and test
[06:25:25] <Unopoo> you can add class when you creating is like this: $('<div><span class="yourClass"></span></div>')
[06:25:25] <Unopoo> or add it later by using .addClass()
[06:25:55] <Unopoo> you can test it by using .is('yourClassName')
[06:28:18] <anli> Does anyone know which element to .SendKeys (selenium webdriver) to input text into a ckeditor source window?
[06:28:32] <anli> Sorry if it is the wrong channel
[06:31:52] <amanthakur> anli ckeditor?
[06:32:22] <anli> Is it an editor
[06:32:58] <amanthakur> anli get the element by name or id or by xpath
[06:33:10] <amanthakur> anli, i mean the input id
[06:33:20] <amanthakur> or name associated with it
[06:33:28] <anli> I do not know which the correct element is, textareas seems to be either detached or invisible
[06:33:48] <anli> Maybe ckeditor just listens on a click somewhere and emulates a textarea
[06:34:02] <anli> Making a cursor out of a blinking div...
[06:34:44] <anli> I have tried .cke_source, which seems to be a promising name
[06:35:01] <anli> Sending keystrokes however, gives nothing
[06:50:27] <cjohnson> read the API for ckeditor
[07:19:28] <mitzev_> whats best way to store key=>value pairs in an array
[07:20:23] <mitzev_> i have html tables, each has an h1, that is basically the ID of the table
[07:21:03] <mitzev_> so i need to fetch the h1 of each table, and then create subarrays for each h1 with the tables key=>vals
[07:26:31] <cjohnson> objects
[07:26:36] <cjohnson> {} not []
[07:26:59] <cjohnson> or an array of objects
[07:27:13] <cjohnson> but generally if you want key => value {} is the right way to do that
[07:42:04] <mitzev_> :]
[07:42:45] <DevAntoine> hi
[07:44:43] <DevAntoine> I'm having an issue with event bubbling: I have a change listener on a select. When its value change, I ask the user a confirmation to know if he really wants to change the value. If he doesn't want to I need to stop the event's propagation, using stopPropagation(). But it doesn't work and I'm wondering if it's not caused by the confirm()?
[07:54:22] <drey> Are there any known issues with certain browsers not firing the success callback of $.ajax() even if the result is 200?
[07:59:29] <Cork> drey: not an issue, but the browser might block 200 results if the ajax call is cross domain and no cors headers
[08:03:24] <drey> Cork: nop, it's really strage too. I can use the same chrome logged into the same system on different machines and one works and the other doesn't
[08:03:30] <drey> and that' chrome
[08:03:31] <drey> not ie
[08:03:34] <drey> that's*
[08:03:39] <drey> ie works on both
[08:03:47] <drey> such surprising
[08:04:17] <drey> the same none working browser also decides to generate a crazy date string.
[08:04:22] <drey> not sure if it's some kind of locale issue
[08:04:27] <drey> though in theory both are using DE
[08:05:42] <drey> I'm working round it at the moment by creating my own Date object and toISOString()-ing it and then using the complete callback of $.ajax and fishing the json string out the xhr
[08:06:03] <drey> odd though.
[08:14:46] * cjohnson divines DevAntoine's code
[08:16:37] <Sherafff> how can i know from what come from an event?
[08:17:06] <cjohnson> Sherafff: ?
[08:17:09] <mitzev_> patience
[08:17:15] <Sherafff> i have a form, and an event bind on that form for "submit", with preventDefault
[08:17:23] <Sherafff> so any input field, if you press enter it submit
[08:17:40] <Sherafff> but i have a special field that i don't want it to submit the form, i want to do a special function for this field
[08:17:55] <cjohnson> capture the enter button on that field and prevent that
[08:17:58] <cjohnson> ?
[08:17:59] <Sherafff> so i guess  i need to know that it come from that field to just return fasle in my function that submit
[08:18:09] <cjohnson> that way you never even get into the submit handler
[08:19:03] <Sherafff> if i do preventDefault on keypress, it doesn't input in the field
[08:19:18] <cjohnson> only the enter button I'm saying
[08:19:23] <cjohnson> and use keydown
[08:19:25] <Sherafff> right
[08:19:29] <Sherafff> why?
[08:19:49] <cjohnson> since it fires before the key is pressed
[08:20:00] <Sherafff> ok
[08:20:04] <Sherafff> so it's just faster?
[08:20:16] <cjohnson> well no I don't think keypress will let you do what you want
[08:20:42] <cjohnson> user presses enter down -> keydown fires -> user releases enter -> keyup fires -> keypress fires
[08:20:45] <cjohnson> I think is the order
[08:21:05] <Sherafff> ok
[08:21:08] <Sherafff> it make sense
[08:21:10] <Sherafff> thanks
[08:22:42] <Sherafff> it works
[08:22:44] <Sherafff> :)
[08:22:52] <cjohnson> great!
[08:27:23] <Sherafff> by they way, you know anyway to reload my js code without to have to reload the whole page? (using chrome)
[08:27:53] <cjohnson> you would have to reload the page generally
[08:28:08] <cjohnson> you could re-append the same <script> tag again but it depends what all your code is doing
[08:28:17] <cjohnson> that may cause problems
[08:28:37] <Sherafff> i'm working on a huge form and i have to refill every input everytime -_-'
[08:30:00] <cjohnson> use a plugin to fill in inputs
[08:30:16] <cjohnson> I wrote a little JS snippet that will populate form fields on my application when I hit a little button
[08:30:20] <cjohnson> and then I only show it in dev mode
[08:31:04] <Sherafff> there is some type="file"
[08:31:15] <cjohnson> you won't be able to reset thoe
[08:31:16] <cjohnson> those*
[08:31:16] <Sherafff> but yeah, it can help for sure
[08:40:54] <missc_tng> Does anyone have some resources or insight on how to setup an "age verification" page to pop up, pre-entrance into a website?
[08:41:34] <cjohnson> which part?
[08:41:46] <cjohnson> there are lots of ways to show dialogs
[08:42:00] <cjohnson> search javascript/jquery modal dialog
[08:42:25] <missc_tng> will check it out ty
[08:42:37] <missc_tng> will I need to deal with cookies?
[08:43:22] <cjohnson> that's up to you
[08:43:31] <cjohnson> if you want it to remember their answer, cookies are a good way to do that yeah
[08:43:41] <missc_tng> ok thanks
[08:44:59] <mitzev_> how can i sort an array of objects based on one of the properties of the object
[08:45:25] <decx> sort()
[08:45:43] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort there's examples here.
[08:45:43] <mitzev_> :)()
[08:45:44] <cjohnson> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[08:46:04] <mitzev_> looking
[08:46:10] <decx> sorts a,b would just be a.key and b.key
[08:46:13] <doug64k> mitzev_: give a comparison function
[08:46:26] <missc_tng> I can combine jquery with PHP right? I'm thinking of handling cookies w/ php and using jquery to have it pop-up
[08:46:45] <cjohnson> jquery doesn't care what your backend is
[08:46:47] <mitzev_> doug64k, ?
[08:47:16] <BillCriswell> If you're using underscore there's a _.sortBy(list, 'someField'')
[08:47:28] <cjohnson> however I can't imagine you want PHP to handle the cookies, javascript can set the cookies directly
[08:47:56] <decx> and that's the way the cookie crumbles
[08:48:08] <missc_tng> hmm. ok. I don't have much experience w/ javascript but ill try to find some info on cookies
[08:48:16] <cjohnson> if (!cookieIsSet) { showDialog() }  and then when they give an acceptable answer, set cookies via document.cookie
[08:48:23] <decx> jquery cookie is pretty good
[08:48:33] <cjohnson> I prefer chocolate chip
[08:48:39] <decx> oh?
[08:48:46] <missc_tng> i was thinking of http://pastebin.com/nD4AGpUz
[08:48:50] <BillCriswell> Do we have some built in allergy to localStorage?
[08:48:52] <cjohnson> when it's slightly warm and the chips are all gooey
[08:49:10] <cjohnson> I don't think we do BillCriswell
[08:49:21] <cjohnson> I don't recall anybody saying "don't use localStorage", at least
[08:50:26] <cjohnson> one consideration is whether you want the server to know about the data or not
[08:50:58] <BillCriswell> cjohnson: I'm always jump to cookies too is why I asked.
[08:51:01] <BillCriswell> Not sure why.
[08:51:11] <doug64k> js> [5,3,1,2,3,5].sort(function(a,b) { return b < a ? -1 : b > a ? 1 : 0; })
[08:51:14] <b-ot> doug64k: No output.
[08:51:21] <doug64k> js> print([5,3,1,2,3,5].sort(function(a,b) { return b < a ? -1 : b > a ? 1 : 0; }))
[08:51:24] <b-ot> doug64k: 5,5,3,3,2,1
[08:51:35] <doug64k> mitzev_: ^
[08:51:45] <missc_tng> I don't even have a server setup yet. Just playing w/ Html5 & Javascript, working on front end
[08:51:57] <BillCriswell> Instead of a, b you'd use like a[someProp] b[someProp]
[08:52:44] <mitzev_> BillCriswell, was it you that told my i should rearrange html output with js after initial output by backend/php ?
[08:52:59] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: Don't think so.
[08:53:09] <mitzev_> do you agree with that?
[08:53:20] <decx> i dont even know what that means
[08:53:24] <cjohnson> I just default to cookies because generally if it's small/trivial enough to be in localStorage, I don't mind it being included in my requests. and I would rather have access to it and not need it than need it and not have access to it (in the backend)
[08:54:13] <mitzev_> i have a webshop, that lists products with attributes, and there is a 'sort by' selection
[08:54:15] <cjohnson> and because the last time I really thought about the two of them I still needed to support IE6 which I don't believe does localStorage
[08:54:18] <mitzev_> i am trying to build the sorting with js
[08:54:30] <cjohnson> how many products mitzev_?
[08:54:33] <cjohnson> enough to use pagination?
[08:54:39] <cjohnson> if so sort in the db
[08:54:46] <mitzev_> some categories have many
[08:55:01] <mitzev_> yes, pages
[08:55:09] <cjohnson> yeah then I would do sorting and filtering in the db
[08:55:12] <cjohnson> that's what it's made for after all ;)
[08:55:31] <mitzev_> i can just sort the current page items can i not?
[08:55:41] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: You can do that.
[08:55:47] <cjohnson> sure but that doesn't seem all that useful
[08:55:48] <mitzev_> and use js to set a cookie on the sorting option, and on other pages check the cookie
[08:56:03] <mitzev_> why?
[08:56:09] <cjohnson> let's say you have Apple through Zoomba, page 1 only has Apple through Cat
[08:56:17] <cjohnson> if you reverse sort, I would expect Zoomba to be first
[08:56:24] <cjohnson> but if you sort in-page-only, Cat would be first
[08:56:34] <mitzev_> good point, i didnt think that far
[08:57:39] <mitzev_> dang it
[08:58:59] <amanthakur> hi guys, I am amking a custom cart.  I have made a form in that cart that applies the discount on the total price. But the problem is that when i apply the discount it takes to the next page. I want to apply the coupon without going to the next page. How can i do that ?? Actually i want to update the section of that page not whole page. Because when the page is refreshed then the values entered by the user are reset again......any help guys??
[08:59:14] <missc_tng> when working with "document" for example, document.cookie.. is the document object part of javascript library? I can't find any documentation
[08:59:19] * cjohnson divines amanthakur's code
[08:59:21] <BillCriswell> mitzev_: You can use ajax to get the product results in an array instead of making a full trip.
[08:59:40] <cjohnson> missc_tng: document is a variable provided by the browser
[08:59:47] <amanthakur> cjohnson, ??
[08:59:51] <cjohnson> if you were to use node.js for instance there would be no document
[09:00:36] <missc_tng> so its just a variable, not an object?
[09:00:45] <cjohnson> it's a variable that points to an object
[09:01:08] <cjohnson> it holds lots of stuff, including the DOM
[09:02:16] <cjohnson> amanthakur: you didn't post any code or anything jquery specific
[09:02:44] <cjohnson> just asked an arbitrary question...this place is for helping with jquery questions
[09:03:38] <amanthakur> cjohnson, i am making the page in ASP.NET MVC 4, i haven't use any jquery yet. Just wanted to know how can i use it to solve my purpose
[09:04:04] <cjohnson> you can use jquery to update a page without reloading it, yes
[09:06:04] <amanthakur> cjohnson, when i apply the coupon code, then the values are sent on the post to another script. Can i do that without going the other page. I mean i just want to get the coupon check and discount applied on the same page.
[09:06:26] <cjohnson> yes, you can
[09:06:43] <amanthakur> cjohnson, any specific jquery function that i can use?
[09:07:34] <cjohnson> you can manipulate page contents by finding the node you want to manipulate and setting using .html()
[09:08:10] <cjohnson> you can make requests instead of form posts using $.ajax()
[09:08:59] <amanthakur> cjohnson, can i get a example code?
[09:09:05] <amanthakur> if possible
[09:09:18] <decx> start with load() go from there
[09:09:33] <cjohnson> this is a place for helping people with their code, not for writing it for them ;)
[09:09:48] <cjohnson> read teh documentation
[09:11:27] <amanthakur> cjohnson, oh you got me wrong, actually i was thinking to see the code by googling it. Means any link that is having a sample code
[09:11:36] <amanthakur> that i can see and understand
[09:11:37] <amanthakur> :)
[09:12:02] <cjohnson> well, google it then ;)
[09:12:08] <cjohnson> and read the documentation on jquery's website
[09:12:57] <cjohnson> http://api.jquery.com/load/ http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/ http://api.jquery.com/html/
[09:13:06] <amanthakur> cjohnson, i requested you because i think you are a pro in jquery and you can give me a link in seconds. I am already googling but didn't found anything useful
[09:13:14] <amanthakur> anyways i'll google again
[09:13:15] <amanthakur> thanks
[09:15:30] <doug64k> amanthakur: not sure what you mean by "how I can use it". you need to add a script tag on the page that loads jquery and you need some js in the page that calls jquery and uses it
[09:16:25] <amanthakur> doug64k, i meant which functions to be used and what parameters to be passed. I know how to include jquery and call it :) thanks though ;)
[09:16:44] <cjohnson> between ajax load and html you should have a good starting point
[09:16:51] <cjohnson> ajax or load, probably not both
[09:17:24] <doug64k> amanthakur: you can put an event handler on the form that handles submit with http://api.jquery.com/on/ $(document).on('submit', 'form', function(event) {
[09:18:21] <doug64k> amanthakur: in there you can event.preventDefault(), then "manually" do the post with $.ajax, then update the page
[09:21:30] <doug64k> $.ajax returns a promise that is resolved/rejected when it has succeeded/failed the request. You can use the return value from $.ajax to attach a handler for success or failure with .done or .fail: $.ajax({url:'foo', data:{pi:3}}).done(function(response) { ... }).fail(function() { ... :( ... })
[09:21:34] <doug64k> amanthakur: ^
[09:25:00] <amanthakur> doug64k, ah ok thanks let me try it
[09:40:10] <BlaXpirit> Is there any reason to prefer ``$(el).prop('id')`` over ``el.id``?
[09:41:27] <mooncup> BlaXpirit: el.id is quicker I think
[09:41:39] <BlaXpirit> ...
[09:41:49] <BlaXpirit> el.id is better for many obvious reasons
[09:42:14] <mooncup> then what you asking?
[09:42:15] <BlaXpirit> but I wonder if there are any advantages of the other one
[09:42:17] <mooncup> ah
[09:43:41] <mooncup> If you only have a selector then you'd have to use the jquery way I think
[09:44:09] <BlaXpirit> I can always do ``$el[0].id`` though
[09:45:05] <shoky_> there is no advantage
[09:45:12] <BlaXpirit> which leads to another preference question - ``$el[0].id`` or ``$el.prop('id')`` - but here the jQuery option comes out better probably
[09:46:02] <BlaXpirit> anyhow, I ask this  because I wrote ``$(el).prop('id')`` without really thinking and now I'm wondering why I did that
[09:46:50] <cjohnson> if el isn't a jquery object already I'd just read .id
[09:47:02] <cjohnson> My guess is you copy/pasted and originally it was using a jquery collection
[09:48:28] <BlaXpirit> Nope... I'm just afraid of DOM more than jQuery
[09:48:31] <BlaXpirit> OK, thanks.
[09:49:12] <cjohnson> the speed difference is generally pretty negligible
[09:50:56] <cjohnson> one downside I can see to using .prop is that it the behavior can be non-obviousi f you call it on a collection of >1 element
[09:51:20] <cjohnson> whereas if you try to call NodeList.id you'll get an error, I would generally prefer the latter if I'm expecting only a single node
[10:08:16] <dangerousdave> aal, ask me a question, any question
[10:17:11] <sacho> stuff.
[10:47:45] <ManicPanic> how do i put all json data into a global variable ?
[10:48:07] <ManicPanic> like this ? var jdata = $.getJSON("data.json", function(data) { return data; });
[10:50:19] <cjohnson> no not like that
[10:50:26] <cjohnson> what are you trying to do ManicPanic? globals are rarely the answer
[10:50:40] <cjohnson> ideally your success function calls whatever function requires access to the data
[10:51:43] <ManicPanic> cjohnson: put all json data into a variable to use in other functions
[10:52:06] <cjohnson> no not "how are you trying to do what you're trying to do" it's "what are you trying to do?" ;)
[10:52:22] <cjohnson> use what I suggested above if that's as descriptive as you want to get
[10:53:37] <ManicPanic> this works thanks var jdata; $.getJSON("data.json", function (data) { jdata = data; });
[10:54:07] <cjohnson> almost assuredly the wrong way
[10:56:08] <ManicPanic> cjohnson: gona put into a function and call function in other methods and get all json data to where it is needed
[10:56:15] <cjohnson> ManicPanic: http://jsfiddle.net/ah3ot3fh/
[10:57:05] <cjohnson> the first format lends itself to you thinking that jdata is always available, but because getJSON is async, it won't be
[10:59:07] <cjohnson> ManicPanic: http://jsfiddle.net/ah3ot3fh/1/
[11:01:41] <ManicPanic> cjohnson: jsfiddle not loading my side sorry
[11:02:10] <cjohnson> i'll copy to pastie
[11:02:25] <cjohnson> http://pastie.org/9749148
[11:02:33] <ManicPanic> cjohnson: can you http://pastebin.com it ?
[11:02:52] <cjohnson> example of the logic error you'll commonly run into by trying to use your method: http://pastie.org/9749149
[11:05:15] <ManicPanic> cjohnson: i see , very good way of doing it thanks
[11:05:27] <cjohnson> no prob
[11:48:15] <MeowingtonsPhD> Hello
[11:48:45] <MeowingtonsPhD> I’m using a jquery plugin that permits me to position the caret within an input or textarea
[11:49:05] <MeowingtonsPhD> I was wondering how one can move the viewing window within the input?
[11:49:37] <cjohnson> "move the viewing window within the input" que?
[11:49:43] <cjohnson> scroll an input you mean?
[11:49:47] <MeowingtonsPhD> there’s a situation where the caret is at the end but the field is smaller than the content and the view is returned to the beginning
[11:49:51] <MeowingtonsPhD> yeah
[11:49:53] <BillCriswell> el.scrollIntoView()... I think?
[11:49:57] <cjohnson> $(node).scrollTop I believe
[11:50:13] <MeowingtonsPhD> so I was wondering, given a number caret position if there’s a way to focus on it
[11:50:24] <BillCriswell> Oh good I wasn't imagining that. el.scrollIntoView() will do the trick.
[11:51:31] <MeowingtonsPhD> hmm I get undefined is not a function
[11:52:13] <pll> hey guys, am I losing it?    When someone clicks within a <div> I want to trigger a function;   $('#mydiv').click(function() { alert("hello"); });  <-- shouldnt that trigger an alert when someone clicks in mydiv?
[11:52:20] <BillCriswell> MeowingtonsPhD: It would be on the element and not the jQuery wrap. Do you'd need to do like $('.foo').get(0).scrollIntoView();
[11:52:20] <cjohnson> I hope you didn't just type "el.scrollIntoView()"
[11:52:40] <MeowingtonsPhD> no $(‘#id’).scrollIntoView();
[11:52:41] <cjohnson> pll: jsfiddle please. what you have looks fine
[11:52:52] <BillCriswell> MeowingtonsPhD: You need the .get(0)
[11:53:15] <pll> yeah, it has to be somethign else in my proj; give me a couple ill jsfiddle if I can't find it
[11:53:17] <pll> thanks cj
[11:53:17] <BillCriswell> or [0], the .scollIntoView() isn't jQuery but native.
[11:54:40] <MeowingtonsPhD> hmm not working
[11:54:51] <MeowingtonsPhD> it just stays at the start
[11:56:48] <BillCriswell> MeowingtonsPhD: http://jsbin.com/konariqeve/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[11:57:11] <BillCriswell> Without the true it works as well, but just aligns it to the bottom of the window.
[11:57:53] <MeowingtonsPhD> ahhh I mean the input content
[11:58:39] <MeowingtonsPhD> say the caret is at 30 and I can’t see it anymore as the field is only 10 wide
[12:00:30] <BillCriswell> so they click anywhere in the input you want it to go to the end?
[12:01:55] <MeowingtonsPhD> ok the context is a java framework that doesn’t handle textfield ajax very well. if I do an ajax update while typeing the caret goes back to the start. So before the call I store the position and restore it afterwards
[12:02:47] <MeowingtonsPhD> that works fine but if the field is smaller than its contents I end up with the caret at the correct position but the content has scrolled back to the start
[12:07:04] <BillCriswell> MeowingtonsPhD: Hmmm
[12:12:04] <MeowingtonsPhD> hmm indeed
[12:13:11] <BillCriswell> $('input').get().selectionStart appears to work, in chrome
[12:13:31] <BillCriswell> and you can set it with $('input').get(0).setSelection(start,end);
[12:15:03] <MeowingtonsPhD> nope, not working for me
[12:15:10] <BillCriswell> in what browser?
[12:15:17] <MeowingtonsPhD> chrome
[12:18:01] <BillCriswell> MeowingtonsPhD: http://jsbin.com/konariqeve/3/edit?js,output
[12:19:36] <MeowingtonsPhD> looking good! any idea about browser compatibility?
[12:20:41] <BillCriswell> I do not.
[12:20:50] <BillCriswell> I'm way too lazy to do that right now haha
[12:20:51] <MeowingtonsPhD> oh well I’ll do some testing
[12:20:58] <MeowingtonsPhD> thank you very much
[12:21:01] <BillCriswell> Off to thanksgiving 2.
[12:21:04] <BillCriswell> No problem
[12:21:07] <BillCriswell> Have a good one.
[12:21:12] <MeowingtonsPhD> you too :)
[12:51:48] * CssNoob good morning and good night y'all
[12:57:00] <Guest2294> Hi, I need to load contents of a page B on to page A using jquery, but I am only getting the static content
[12:57:11] <Guest2294> is there a way to fetch dynamically loaded content from page B
[12:57:16] <Guest2294> ?
[12:59:29] <mbrzuzy> I don't think so man
[13:02:05] <decx> Guest2294 if you already load content on page b why cant you just do that on page a
[13:02:19] <decx> i feel like i'm taking crazy pills here
[13:02:21] <NoiseEee> (because page B isn't his website I bet)
[13:02:31] <Guest2294> Its a chrome extension that i'm working on
[13:03:08] <Guest2294> There's data on page b, which comes when i click a link on page a, there are 300+ such links
[13:03:50] <Guest2294> I want only one field from page A corresponding to all the 300 rows that are there on page B
[13:04:04] <Guest2294> This is to show a tabular view
[13:04:10] <NoiseEee> Guest2294: i don't know much about extensions, sorry, but I'd guess if they're in the DOM then they're in the DOM?
[13:05:11] <Guest2294> I'm using jquery for making my extensions
[13:05:20] <cjohnson> is page b something you control?
[13:05:27] <Guest2294> No :(
[13:05:40] <cjohnson> not much you can do
[13:06:01] <cjohnson> if page b is doing stuff dynamically and you can't get access to its API to do that same stuff dynamically
[13:07:16] <Guest2294> ok
[13:07:27] <Guest2294> thank you
[13:14:28] <yazdmich> is there a lib to turn HTML to a JSON object?
[13:15:06] <cjohnson> {foo: someNode.innerHTML}
[13:15:20] <cjohnson> beyond that you wouldn eed to provide specifics about your question
[13:15:55] <Duvdevan> JSON.stringify(yourContent);
[13:16:49] <cjohnson> HTML basically already is a JSON object
[13:16:57] <cjohnson> if you wrap quotes around it
[13:17:10] <cjohnson> the DOM on the other hand would first need to be serialized into HTML via .innerHTML / .outerHTML
[13:20:09] <yazdmich> i mean to convert something like <a href='http://google.com/'>google</a> to {a: {href: 'http://google.com/', contents: 'google'}}
[13:21:18] <cjohnson> for what purpose?
[13:21:22] <cjohnson> what are you trying to solve?
[13:21:33] <cjohnson> that sounds like a DOM, which already exists ;)
[13:21:52] <yazdmich> simpler traversal?
[13:22:04] <yazdmich> cleaner to look at?
[13:53:17] <Renari> Is there a way to get a javascript selector from a jquery object?
[13:55:43] <NoiseEee> Renari: like deduce what selector was used to get the objecT?
[13:57:03] <Renari> No, MutationObserver requires a target node: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver this doesn't appear to work with a jquery object however.
[13:58:07] <Renari> nevermind
[13:58:09] <Renari> found my answer
[13:58:10] <Renari> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-pull-a-native-dom-element-from-a-jquery-object/
[14:01:03] <yazdmich> is there a better way? $(<css selector>)[0].children[1].children[0].children[0].children[0].innerHTML
[14:03:26] <Renari> yazdmich, select the child element directly?
[14:03:40] <Renari> if you have no id or any other way to track down that node, then no
[14:04:11] <Renari> you should consider using id to name your elements if possible
[14:04:38] <yazdmich> im parsing another site
[14:04:58] <yazdmich> okcupid
[14:05:03] <Renari> That's why I said if possible, so if there are no other selectors you can stem from then there would not be a better way.
[14:05:35] <Renari> It's worth mentioning if said site you are parsing is changed your code is very prone to breaking.
[14:06:06] <yazdmich> example of a DOM element im parsing
[14:06:07] <yazdmich> http://hastebin.com/uvojerutef.xml
[14:07:28] <Renari> yazdmich, you could just use $(selector).find() to pull out the element you are looking for
[14:07:34] <yazdmich> ah
[14:07:44] <Renari> these all have different classes that can be used to differentiate them
[14:07:55] <Renari> so if you select their container you can search within it
[14:23:27] <damarusama> hi there, I am using .html($('#links a').eq(index).data('description'));
[14:23:44] <damarusama> to treat the data-description as html content
[14:24:03] <damarusama> would would I go about using similar code to reach the title tag
[14:24:20] <damarusama> s/would/how/
[14:28:41] <NoiseEee> var someATagsTitle = $('a').prop('title')
[14:32:13] <damarusama> NoiseEee: the prop... thanks
[14:48:11] <damarusama> when I use $(this).children how can I reach title $(this).children('title') doesn't cut it
[15:01:06] <damarusama> $(this).children().prop('title').html($('#links a').eq(index).prop('title'));
[15:01:13] <damarusama> not sure what's wrong with that
[15:01:14] <damarusama>  ;(
[15:01:42] <afroradiohead> prop
[15:01:55] <damarusama> should be attr
[15:01:57] <damarusama> ?
[15:02:37] <afroradiohead> your prop will return the "title" part of "<div title='my title'>"
[15:02:42] <afroradiohead> it won't return another jquery selector
[15:03:02] <afroradiohead> what are u trying to do?
[15:03:25] <afroradiohead> find a child based on the title? or insert data into the title attribute?
[15:03:40] <damarusama> insert html date in the title attribute
[15:03:43] <damarusama> data
[15:04:18] <afroradiohead> $(this).children().attr('title', $('#links a').eq(index).attr('title'));
[15:04:34] <afroradiohead> basically transfer the title from the <a> to the other element?
[15:05:07] <damarusama> well here is the example with the deta-description that works :
[15:05:07] <damarusama> $(this).children('.description').html($('#links a').eq(index).data('description'));
[15:05:37] <afroradiohead> right, on that one your putting it in (inside) the description class
[15:05:55] <afroradiohead> in the other one, it looked like you were trying to put it (inside) a title attribute
[15:05:57] <damarusama> yes trying to do the same with the title attr
[15:06:08] <afroradiohead> yeah, what I gave you should work
[15:07:52] <afroradiohead> let me know if it does
[15:07:54] <damarusama> afroradiohead: but there is no more .html function in there
[15:08:15] <afroradiohead> right. So the $("element").html inserts it between <div></div>
[15:08:38] <afroradiohead> $("element").attr("title", 'asdfasfs') does <div title='asdfasfs'></div>
[15:08:52] <afroradiohead> $("element").html('asdfasfs') does <div>asdfasfs</div>
[15:09:17] <damarusama> my title contains html elements, that I need to render as html
[15:09:44] <damarusama> hum...
[15:10:06] <afroradiohead> ok then lets try this... $(this).children() will get the child element right?
[15:10:24] <damarusama> yes
[15:10:48] <afroradiohead> what do you feel prop("title") will return?
[15:11:11] <damarusama> the title of the child element
[15:11:32] <afroradiohead> right. The title attribute as (text)
[15:12:02] <afroradiohead> you can't do text.html() from there
[15:12:22] <afroradiohead> (also keep in mind, attr is better used than prop)
[15:12:40] <afroradiohead> you want to change the title attribute right?
[15:13:08] <damarusama> yes
[15:13:08] <afroradiohead> like <div title='this will change here'></div> - is that correct?
[15:13:13] <afroradiohead> okie doke
[15:13:33] <afroradiohead> then $(this).children().attr("title", "this will change here")
[15:13:41] <damarusama> well I'm transforming the title attribute to html just before a gallery picks it up
[15:13:58] <damarusama> this is how it gets triggered :
[15:13:59] <damarusama> $('#blueimp-gallery').on('slide', function (event, index, slide) {
[15:14:16] <afroradiohead> and your insertting html into the title attribute?
[15:14:40] <damarusama> well I am making sure that what the gallery is using is html, and not text
[15:15:12] <afroradiohead> so your element will look like <div title='<div>some text</div>'></div>?
[15:15:48] <damarusama> that's what the element looks like, <img title="text <br> text">,
[15:16:35] <afroradiohead> gotchya
[15:16:40] <damarusama> at first, same thing with the data-description  <img data-description="description <br> more <br> more">
[15:17:09] <damarusama> for some reason the datadescription gets 'translated' ok, but not the title itself
[15:17:57] <afroradiohead> when you perform the slide event, when you inspect element, what does that element look like?
[15:18:08] <afroradiohead> can you paste that?
[15:18:47] <damarusama> ok just a sec
[15:19:29] <damarusama> it gets transform in a <p class='description'>
[15:19:50] <damarusama> and the title becomes a h3
[15:20:28] <afroradiohead> ok, do me a favor and do this:
[15:20:40] <afroradiohead> $(this).children().attr('title', 'apples and cheese')
[15:20:44] <afroradiohead> and let me know if that works
[15:21:15] <afroradiohead> if it shows apples and cheese in your thingy
[15:21:33] <damarusama> nopr
[15:21:35] <damarusama> nope
[15:21:50] <damarusama> leaves the actual title
[15:22:28] <afroradiohead> ok so then just to be sure i'm on the same page as you. Are you trying to do <div title='apples and cheese'></div> ?
[15:23:48] <damarusama> it's  <a data-description="desc <br> more" title="title with html <br> in it" > <img ... > </a>
[15:24:47] <afroradiohead> gotchya. And your trying to change what's in that title tag
[15:25:31] <afroradiohead> now... as a test... you're saying $(this).children().attr('title', 'apples and cheese')  isn't changing that title tag to "apples and cheese"?
[15:25:55] <afroradiohead> i mean the "title attribute"
[15:26:26] <damarusama> ho yes
[15:26:28] <damarusama> it is
[15:26:51] <damarusama> it pushed the apple and cheese to the title attribute of the gallery
[15:27:02] <damarusama> it doesn't change the 'content' of the title itself
[15:27:09] <afroradiohead> right i thought so
[15:27:17] <afroradiohead> the plugin has a different way of doing it
[15:27:27] <afroradiohead> maybe try data-title?
[15:29:59] <damarusama>    $(this).children().attr('title',"").html($('#links a').eq(index).attr('title'));
[15:30:04] <damarusama> this almost work
[15:30:15] <damarusama> but then add the html to all the elements on the gallery!!
[15:30:50] <afroradiohead> right. There's a difference between magic and knowing... do you know why that almost works?
[15:30:51] <damarusama> hahaha funny... all the elements in the generated gallery have the html as their content
[15:31:04] <damarusama> yeah I am at the magic part
[15:31:06] <damarusama> ;)
[15:31:08] <afroradiohead> lol
[15:31:36] <damarusama> it's showing h3 class="title" style="font-size:3em; width:25%" title="">
[15:31:36] <damarusama>     Derviche tourneur
[15:31:36] <damarusama>     <br></br>
[15:31:36] <damarusama>        \n 36x46cm
[15:31:49] <damarusama> </h3>
[15:31:56] <afroradiohead> It's important to know why it's doing that btw
[15:32:08] <damarusama> but it's doing that to all the elements!!
[15:32:21] <afroradiohead> right, do you know why?
[15:32:38] <afroradiohead> like in your code what's making it do that
[15:32:51] <damarusama> well it does it to all the element that have a title attr
[15:33:04] <damarusama> with the description attribute there was only one element that had that
[15:33:22] <damarusama> so it was simple to nail it down
[15:33:40] <damarusama> there is only 1 h3
[15:33:43] <damarusama> though
[15:33:48] <damarusama> maybe I can aim for that?
[15:33:59] <afroradiohead> yep
[15:34:56] <damarusama> kool I actually learned something today
[15:34:57] <damarusama> :D
[15:34:59] <damarusama> finally

[15:41:56] <theweirdn8> if possible can you help me sort out why my test like system is not working?
[15:42:06] <afroradiohead> sure
[15:42:13] <theweirdn8> I'm pretty n00by at jquery
[15:42:14] <theweirdn8> http://www.always5pm.com/like_test.html
[15:43:16] <afroradiohead> (itemMediaType:itemMediaType) =>{itemMediaType:itemMediaType}
[15:43:17] <afroradiohead> try that
[15:43:24] <afroradiohead> the second one
[15:44:10] <afroradiohead> yeah, in javascript do you know the different between () and {}?
[15:44:10] <theweirdn8> nothing happened
[15:44:24] <afroradiohead> are you on chrome or firefox?
[15:44:41] <theweirdn8> chrome
[15:44:59] <theweirdn8> btw, am i supposed to do ajax/whatever.php
[15:45:03] <theweirdn8> even if its in the same directory?
[15:45:11] <afroradiohead> yeah
[15:45:16] <afroradiohead> are you familiar with ajax?
[15:45:28] <theweirdn8> nope
[15:45:38] <theweirdn8> lol, complete n00b trying to make a few js features
[15:45:41] <afroradiohead> it's cool. Ok right click and press inspect element?
[15:45:50] <afroradiohead> sorry, press inspect element
[15:46:01] <afroradiohead> did u do that?
[15:46:20] <theweirdn8> yes
[15:46:30] <afroradiohead> then click the "console" tab
[15:46:56] <afroradiohead> then refresh the page
[15:46:59] <theweirdn8> unexpected token
[15:46:59] <theweirdn8> like_update
[15:47:19] <afroradiohead> on line 3?
[15:47:50] <theweirdn8> yes
[15:47:53] <theweirdn8> weird...
[15:48:09] <theweirdn8> http://www.always5pm.com/like_update.php does exist tho...
[15:48:10] <afroradiohead> right. That's because your using parenthesis instead of brackets
[15:48:20] <afroradiohead> its a syntax error
[15:48:53] <afroradiohead> here i'll write it for you
[15:48:56] <afroradiohead> hold on
[15:49:10] <theweirdn8> ok, thank you
[15:49:17] <mikesm> I am trying to recreate this example: http://jqueryui.com/tabs/#sortable on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ro81a1t4/, but it's not working the same.
[15:50:13] <mikesm> on the jqueryui website, you can drag a tab and the other tabs around it won't collapse. However, on my jsfiddle recreation, whenever I click and hold a tab, the tabs to the right collapse to the left.
[15:50:24] <mikesm> Any ideas?
[15:51:09] <afroradiohead> theweirdn8: this should work. Though I can't test it: http://laravel.io/bin/52zXy
[15:51:30] <afroradiohead> mikesm: it says your fiddle doesn't exist
[15:51:42] <afroradiohead> oh, had to remove the comma
[15:53:11] <afroradiohead> not happening to me mikesm, it's working the same as on the jquery ui site
[15:53:13] <theweirdn8> still broken
[15:53:40] <mikesm> afroradiohead: interesting. What web browser are you using?
[15:53:46] <afroradiohead> mikesm: chrome
[15:53:54] <afroradiohead> theweirdn8: do you know why its still broken?
[15:54:01] <theweirdn8> nope
[15:54:07] <theweirdn8> still the unknown like_update error
[15:54:13] <theweirdn8>  Uncaught ReferenceError: like_update is not definedlike_test.html:9 onclick
[15:54:43] <mikesm> afroradiohead: so just toi confirm, when you click a tab and drag it around the other tabs don't move until you drop the selected tab in a new position?
[15:54:47] <afroradiohead> on line 14 add );
[15:55:21] <mikesm> afroradiohead: sorry, i mean until after you drag the selected tab into a new position
[15:55:22] <afroradiohead> mikesm: the other tabs do move
[15:56:06] <theweirdn8> so sad, still no worke
[15:56:41] <afroradiohead> theweirdn8: I think you should visit codeschool.com to learn a bit of javascript
[15:56:44] <mikesm> hrrrmmm, I wish there was a way to make a quick video to show what I am seeing
[15:56:45] <afroradiohead> syntax is everything
[15:56:50] <afroradiohead> add );
[15:56:57] <afroradiohead> with the ending parenthesis
[15:57:15] <afroradiohead> mikesm: i'm sure there is
[15:57:59] <afroradiohead> then on line 3, remove the ending ; theweirdn8
[15:58:36] <afroradiohead> sorry, remove the ending parenthesis on line 14
[15:58:49] <theweirdn8> removed
[15:58:51] <theweirdn8> still no work..
[15:59:06] <theweirdn8> code is essentially same as this: http://youtu.be/klikwGdsO8A?t=11m10s
[15:59:35] <afroradiohead> nope, there's still some synatical difference
[15:59:56] <afroradiohead> line 19, you have ,}
[15:59:59] <afroradiohead> remove the comma
[16:01:00] <afroradiohead> +itemMediaId'_likes' should be +itemMediaId+'_likes'
[16:01:46] <afroradiohead> on line 20
[16:01:57] <mikesm> Does anyone know of any widget or way to get sortable tabs using jquery, which also works on touchscreens?
[16:01:59] <theweirdn8> im not sure which comman are u referencing...
[16:02:18] <mikesm> I want tabs that are similar to the ones in the web browser
[16:03:02] <afroradiohead> theweirdn8: i may have been looking at an old version. But yeah the thing with javascript, when you inspect element and look at the console, if there's an error, everything else won't work
[16:03:43] <theweirdn8> NEW error appeared
[16:03:43] <theweirdn8> like_functions.js:3 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not definedlike_functions.js:3 like_updatelike_test.html:9 onclick
[16:05:02] <theweirdn8> rofl, 1st need to reinclude jquery
[16:05:06] <afroradiohead> heh
[16:06:10] <theweirdn8> Thank Jesus and you, it works!
[16:06:11] <theweirdn8> hit refresh
[16:06:15] <theweirdn8> and like it for me baby!
[16:07:14] <theweirdn8> CORRECTION?!

[16:07:56] <mikesm> nm I may have found one. http://touchpunch.furf.com/ if anyone is interested.
[16:08:16] <afroradiohead> lol

[22:03:01] <abailarri> Hello. I have this code and when I click the div status is always to 1, it not alternates from 1 to 0 and from to 0 to 1. Any help pleas? http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/8/
[22:07:24] <Snerf> abailarri, you should use $(this).data('status')
[22:08:19] <abailarri> Snerf, where?
[22:08:38] <Snerf> I mean: $(this).data('status') =1;
[22:14:29] <abailarri> Snerf, like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/11/
[22:23:49] <Snerf> ya, doesnt seem to work tho
[22:25:08] <Snerf> ah, you were right.. lol.. gettin rusty: http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/12/
[22:25:14] <Snerf> my mind was elsewhere, my bad
[22:26:40] <Snerf> alert (status) should be alert($(this).data('status')) tho, to get the updated value
[22:54:19] <abailarri> Snerf, this is my real code: http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/14/ And it not change the status
[22:54:55] <abailarri> this Snerf http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/15/
[22:57:11] <Snerf> abailarri, that will always be 0, because status isnt a global var, its a local one in each fucntion
[22:57:47] <Snerf> make a global status, and change the name of the status var in answered, or it conflicts, or remove it, as its a global var
[22:58:16] <abailarri> yes
[22:58:27] <Snerf> you answered is 3 vars, not 1.. its a big ole mess
[22:58:37] <Snerf> so, have fun :)
[23:03:42] <abailarri> Snerf, do you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/17/
[23:06:26] <abailarri> sorry Snerf like this http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/18/
[23:07:11] <abailarri> shiiit like this http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/19/
[23:13:16] <shebbi> how to hide <button> value using jquery?
[23:13:30] <shebbi> oops
[23:14:01] <shebbi> how to hide the text between <button>text to hide</hide>
[23:14:56] <abailarri> shebbi, do you mean <button>text to hide</button>?
[23:15:26] <shebbi> yes
[23:15:38] <Uhkis> $('button').text('');
[23:15:57] <shebbi> heard IE7 uses text between and not value attribute
[23:16:27] <shebbi> Uhkis: I don't want to make it empty.
[23:16:40] <shebbi> Uhkis: Just hide it so it's not visible.
[23:16:40] <abailarri> shebbi, changte the css
[23:16:54] <abailarri> .ccs('color', 'transparent');
[23:17:16] <Uhkis> that would hide the whole button
[23:17:30] <Uhkis> oh wait, nvm
[23:17:32] <shebbi> abailarri: I plan to use a background image with the button.
[23:17:44] <abailarri> then change color (is the font)
[23:17:52] <abailarri> and add another  background
[23:18:23] <shebbi> abailarri: OK I'll try it. Thanks for the tips.
[23:20:31] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[23:24:39] <abailarri> anyone know why the status attribute not changes? http://jsfiddle.net/6s4uxpz8/26/
