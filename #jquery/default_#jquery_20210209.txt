[01:17:48] <Bustin> very, very new to jquery/ajax/js - but am curious, is this something that would be considered "proper" for my login script? If not, what can be improved/changed to be more efficient code wise, and secure, etc. Thank you https://pastebin.com/auEpB805
[01:19:09] <robertmaxrees> first question - what version of query are you using?
[01:19:18] <robertmaxrees> *jquery
[01:20:00] <robertmaxrees> Bustin
[01:22:01] <Bustin> robertmaxrees: 3.5.1
[01:22:26] <robertmaxrees> rad.  so first thing I'd change here would be to ditch that success and go with .then() - promises are where you want to default these days.
[01:23:29] <robertmaxrees> which would look liek this: https://bpa.st/7D4A
[01:24:48] <Bustin> I don't see any difference in that paste, looks like my original?
[01:24:54] <Bustin> am I missing something, sorry
[01:25:00] <robertmaxrees> notice there's no success:
[01:25:07] <Bustin> oh never mind, I see!
[01:25:12] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:25:30] <robertmaxrees> next up - nobody indents else if like that.  put them on the same line.
[01:26:06] <Cork> hmm, i would prob go with .done instead of .then as then will replace the promise content
[01:26:59] <robertmaxrees> i suggest .then() always since $.ajax() returns a deferred, which is a promise :)
[01:27:06] <robertmaxrees> and .done() is jquery-specific.
[01:27:41] <Cork> robertmaxrees: then one has to warn that one always has to end the function with return (input parameter) or adding additional handlers will break
[01:27:56] <robertmaxrees> fair, though that's like any other promise.
[01:28:21] <Cork> ya, but not how $.ajax is normally used
[01:28:37] <robertmaxrees> i see it used like that all the time :)
[01:28:40] <Cork> chaining .done/.always/.fail is very common
[01:29:16] <robertmaxrees> .then().catch().always() will work fine, too.
[01:29:25] <Cork> not what i meant
[01:29:43] <robertmaxrees> oh, i rarely see people using the jquery-specific methods these days personally.
[01:29:44] <Bustin> I know this is not PHP, but this is the script for the log in, just to get a better idea of what I am doing? https://bpa.st/B3UA
[01:29:56] <robertmaxrees> Bustin let's stick with the js for now.
[01:30:00] <Cork> function doAjax(url) { return $.ajax().done(things that should always happen); }; doAjax("something").done(extraAction);
[01:30:07] <Bustin> ^ okay, thanks. I'm here robertmaxrees
[01:30:25] <robertmaxrees> next question: why are you returning false there?  are you trying to preventDefault on the form post?
[01:31:05] <robertmaxrees> (ie stop the form from posting)
[01:31:55] <Bustin> well, the form is posting to a "scripts" folder, the page it's posting to is an external page, so I thought that was a requirement so the page doesn't "refresh"?
[01:32:20] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so i'd swap that to an explicit e.preventDefault() instead :)
[01:33:14] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/P5XA like this - return false; accomplishes something similar, but this makes your intent much clearer.
[01:35:00] <Bustin> I am following
[01:36:09] <robertmaxrees> next up: your data.error handling could be taken care of a few different ways.  for starters - will it ever be anything other than 'true' or 'false'?
[01:36:55] <Bustin> for logging in, I think it's just the checks (email / password), maybe I could throw some more form validation in, checking for string lengths, empty fields, etc?
[01:36:57] <Bustin> but
[01:37:06] <Bustin> still, doesn't it just equate to true/false?
[01:38:00] <robertmaxrees> :) that's what i'm getting at.  so general rule of thumb - you very rarely want double equals.  default to triple equals.  BUT here, you're checking if data.error is true, right?
[01:38:16] <robertmaxrees> else, do something else.
[01:38:40] <Bustin> Yes, correct
[01:39:46] <robertmaxrees> so all if (statement) { does is check if the statement is truthy.  so your if (data.error == true) { is the same as if (data.error) {
[01:39:51] <Bustin> can't I just do if (data.error) { blah } else { bla }
[01:39:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[01:39:57] <Bustin> yes
[01:39:59] <robertmaxrees> what i'm getting at.
[01:40:01] <Bustin> thank you
[01:40:35] <robertmaxrees> you could go a step further and leverage the promise, but i'm gonna spare you on that one for the moment to not add to the complexity.
[01:41:56] <Bustin> https://bpa.st/BYCA - where I am at thus far. I know you said put them on one line (if else), but the formatting in ajax/jquery/js seems to differ from php (what I am used to) in a few ways.
[01:42:30] <robertmaxrees> your formatting there is what i'd expect at this point.
[01:42:49] <robertmaxrees> the one-line else if thing what onle when you had a, well, else if () { check :)
[01:43:17] <robertmaxrees> so another question - why are you making your users wait for three seconds on success?
[01:45:46] <Bustin> to be honest, for aesthetic purposes only, lol. I mean, I have always been used to a nice redirect, not instant log in, without a message and redirect?
[01:47:34] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of the last time i saw a site made me wait a full three seconds after clicking a button to do something.  if you wanted to add some interactivity, I'd move those hides to after the preventDefault();, maybe show a spinner if login can take a second, and then send them to the next page as soon as possible.
[01:47:54] <robertmaxrees> 'cause otherwise it's "cool!  you logged in.  aaaand now wait."
[01:48:30] <Bustin> I would have no idea on how to show a spinner while they redirect, lol. But that's one thing I've always wanted to do, but makes sense what you're saying.
[01:48:52] <robertmaxrees> :) you know how to show/hide things haha
[01:48:54] <Bustin> people are impatient, they dont want to wait.
[01:49:48] <robertmaxrees> yar.  literally the only time you want to entertain the idea of artificial delays is when your application is literally so fast that users don't notice something happened after they clicked.  which rarely happens.
[01:50:48] <robertmaxrees> i'ma throw a couple ideas at you - one sec.
[01:50:53] <Bustin> thank you.
[01:54:00] <robertmaxrees> https://bpa.st/ZCFQ
[01:56:05] <robertmaxrees> so this does a few things: store jquery objects in vars so you don't have to select them more than once, pushes you to make a proper hide class since .hide() and .show() can cause headaches in some particular circumstances, and removes the delay.
[01:56:33] <robertmaxrees> oh and it whacks the whole thing in an IIFE for a one-time scope so you don't push everything into the global scope.
[02:01:10] <Bustin> robertmaxrees: https://bpa.st/WMAA - I changed it a tad. Should I be resetting form input values on submit? People could just spam login?
[02:01:49] <robertmaxrees> your server should be checking for that and handling accordingly.
[02:02:21] <Bustin> I guess I could put the post values in a session and clear upon submit.
[02:02:24] <Bustin> via PHP
[02:03:04] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to handle that.  check how to deal with multiple form submits :)  also - is #loginSubmit the form??
[02:06:41] <Bustin> yes, the form ID is loginSubmit
[02:07:38] <robertmaxrees> alrighty.  so long as it's not the submit button :)  the pedant in me wants to say you should change it to loginForm but :shrug: your call :)
[02:08:31] <Bustin> I'll do it, better naming.
[02:09:33] <Bustin> I have another question, this is in a file called "global.js" - how would I add other things to this file as well? Just under this, add whatever else? That's what confuses me too
[02:09:50] <robertmaxrees> depends on how complex the file could get.
[02:10:33] <robertmaxrees> do you have general stuff you'd like to add to your site in general?  or other stuff for this login page?
[02:11:31] <Bustin> well, for the registration page, I plan to have it function the same, so I will probably be adding the functionality for that as well.
[02:11:51] <Bustin> But as far as other stuff goes, I'm not sure yet, I guess I'll see when that time comes.
[02:12:32] <robertmaxrees> i would look into something like webpack, depending, and make your code more generic and modular.
[02:19:19] <Bustin> robertmaxrees: thanks a ton for all your help. I'll check in to webpack as well.
[02:20:06] <robertmaxrees> glad I could help :)
[08:37:23] <pepa> I have a "command" in kendoui that is trying to show this
[08:37:24] <pepa> https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/icons-web
[08:37:24] <pepa> the one that says "k-i-edit"      but it's not working
[08:37:24] <pepa> 14:35 <pepa> can you help me?
[09:16:35] <Cork> pepa: that depends on a special font, are you sure your loading WebComponentIcons?
[09:16:58] <Cork> (though doesn't have anything to do with jquery)
[09:17:57] <pepa> what is WebComponentIcons?
[09:18:32] <Cork> what they call the font they use for there icons
[09:19:31] <Cork> https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/assets/icon-font.css?806399061
[09:19:38] <Cork> first rule in the file
[09:20:01] <Cork> note i don't know shit about kendo ui, just checking the css rules
[09:20:40] <pepa> you mean this? .k-i-edit::before{content:"\e10b"}
[09:20:50] <Cork> @font-face{font-family:....
[09:21:00] <Cork> like i said first rule
[09:21:38] <pepa> so the images are in this file? /kendo-ui/assets/WebComponentsIcons.eot
[09:21:45] <Cork> not images
[09:21:49] <Cork> its a font
[09:21:57] <Cork> and that is the ie version you need the woff too
[09:22:46] <pepa> but there's an image there of a pencil
[09:23:01] <Cork> no it is a font glyf
[09:23:08] <Cork> *glyph
[09:23:41] <pepa> right
[09:23:41] <Cork> its the exact same structure as awsomefont uses
[09:23:56] <pepa> but there I see the little pencil image
[09:24:08] <pepa> but in my project I see e10b
[09:24:29] <pepa> so it's not replacing it
[09:24:40] <pepa> maybe it doesn't have that font?
[09:25:18] <Cork> that is what i said, you need to load that font in the page for the glyph to render correctly
[09:25:36] <Cork> as again it isn't an image, it ia a glyph
[09:25:49] <Cork> just like a b and c is a glyph
[09:26:13] <Cork> just a different unicode range
[09:26:24] <pepa> a b c 1 2 3 killing is the sport of the elite
[09:26:54] <pepa> so somewhere in my project I need the file WebComponentsIcons.eot
[09:27:04] <Cork> and \e10b is the unicode used for the pen
[09:27:17] <pepa> right
[09:27:22] <Cork> pepa: you need all the files defined in the font-face rule
[09:27:35] <Cork> AND the fontface rule if you don't already have it
[09:28:26] <pepa> sorry but I got lost... how did you get to this file?  https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/assets/icon-font.css?806399061
[09:28:47] <Cork> just inspected the dom in the page you linked
[09:32:39] <pepa> so why did you choose to look at that particular file?
[09:32:50] <pepa> I'm saying because in my real project I don't have that file
[09:33:37] <Cork> i followed the rules that created the pen in the ui
[09:33:47] <Cork> and it pointed to that file
[09:34:18] <Cork> it is most likely not the same file for you, but you have to check what your project should use to get those rules defined
[09:34:39] <Cork> again you would have to check the installation documentations as i've never used the project
[09:35:38] <pepa> so I go to the pen, click inspect, I see "k-icon" and "k-i-edit"... from there where do I go?
[09:36:13] <Cork> you expand the elemnt and get the :before element and follow its font definition and definition rule for the content
[09:36:40] <Cork> both point to the same resource in this case
[09:38:53] <pepa> when you say "follow its font definition"... what do you mean exactly?
[09:39:02] <pepa> I mean in the debugger
[09:40:07] <Cork> .k-icon { font-family: 'WebComponentsIcons'; }
[09:40:27] <Cork> depending on what browser you use you can get the font face declaration
[09:41:32] <pepa> I'm in chrome
[09:41:57] <Cork> pepa: i'm not going to sit here and step by step break down a page for you
[09:42:24] <Cork> we'll be here for ever if we go for that
[09:42:38] <Cork> it's better to read there documentation to understand there structure
[09:43:13] <pepa> yes of course
[09:44:39] <pepa> so in my real project I see in firefox... .k-i-edit::before{content: "\e0d5"}       and it points to a file kendo.common-bootstrap.css
[09:45:16] <pepa> I try to open this file by clicking on the link in firefox debugger
[09:45:34] <pepa> and it says "error while fetching an original source"
[09:45:49] <Cork> most likely cause it uses a source map
[09:46:14] <Cork> and the source.map is none standard, chrome supports some of those but firefox is more stringent
[09:49:10] <pepa> I loaded my app in chrome
[09:49:19] <pepa> so I click on the :before
[09:49:53] <pepa> the same thing opens          .k-i-edit::before{content: "\e0d5"}
[09:50:56] <pepa> points to http://localhost:7001/source/web/kendo.common-bootstrap.css
[09:51:07] <pepa> I click in the link that chrome provides
[09:51:12] <pepa> and it can't find the file
[09:53:47] <pepa> but how does it build those urls like http://localhost:7001/source/web/kendo.common-bootstrap.css
[09:58:10] <pepa> jelou?
[10:00:15] <Uhkis> this channel isn't for browser debugger support
[10:14:37] <pepa> who knows kendoui?
[12:08:08] <dimi1947> it seems that ckicking inside an input fires also a click event along with focus...I though only focus would fire
[12:29:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.  both fire.
[15:29:00] <chazy> hi, i have a question, if i use a non-anonymous function for the ajax success, should it pass the json response parsed as an object instead of an string?
[15:29:21] <chazy> because i'm getting the json response as a string, isntead of an object
[15:29:34] <robertmaxrees> depends on how you want to abstract the function I guess.
[15:29:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to parse it either way though.
[15:30:03] <chazy> how so? i don't remember having to parse the string
[15:30:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:30:17] <robertmaxrees> can you show what you were doing and what you're doing now?
[15:30:40] <chazy> i've been using jquery for some years now and the data parameter has always been an object
[15:31:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm very confused about the issue now :)
[15:31:12] <chazy> $.ajax({ success: success }) instead of $.ajax({ success: function (data) { data.message } })
[15:31:22] <robertmaxrees> that should work fine.
[15:31:51] <robertmaxrees> did you change any other ajax options?
[15:31:58] <chazy> well im getting a string in function success (data) { console.log(typeof data); // string })
[15:32:19] <robertmaxrees> did you change anything server-side?
[15:32:19] <chazy> the only thing i changed is jQuery.ajaxSetup({ async: false })
[15:32:37] <robertmaxrees> erm, try turning that off.
[15:32:42] <chazy> no, in the developer tools i can see that the response is JSON
[15:32:50] <robertmaxrees> even if it doesn't fix this issue, you don't ever want to turn off async.
[15:33:24] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.  jquery doesn't magically treat the response differently depending on anonymous vs standard functions.
[15:34:01] <chazy> ok thanks, i'm gonna keep debugging this, i know the problem is somewhere
[15:34:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd make sure you didn't change anything else accidentally on the client and server.
[15:42:06] <chazy> robertmaxrees: so this is the actual code, maybe i'm blind and there's something wrong, do you mind taking a look? https://gist.github.com/ChazyTheBest/5f01c309571515246d65836a49d7dd95
[15:42:49] <robertmaxrees> your code there says it: '(string) {"message":"There was a problem loading your data."}'
[15:43:10] <robertmaxrees> try console.log(typeof data) in that success handler.  what do you get?
[15:43:27] <chazy> yes that's what i did, typeof data
[15:43:32] <chazy> it says string
[15:43:37] <robertmaxrees> then it's a string.
[15:43:40] <robertmaxrees> gotta parse it.
[15:44:05] <chazy> shouldn't, not jquery, but javascript take care of that?
[15:44:14] <chazy> i mean it always does
[15:44:33] <robertmaxrees> going to guess a response header is causing an issue here.
[15:44:49] <robertmaxrees> it tries to, but uses clues from the response to tell it what to do.
[15:45:35] <chazy> ah you're right! how weird this is the only time i forgot to add a json header in php...
[15:45:45] <robertmaxrees> :) that would do it.
[15:45:51] <robertmaxrees> json != javascript.
[15:47:09] <chazy> even thought the header contet type is text/html, the response tab shows it JSON
[15:47:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds like your dev tools might be trying to infer things on their own.
[15:47:29] <chazy> the browser is being misleading hehe
[15:47:47] <robertmaxrees> or its doing its own detection :) s'why you look at the response headers and whatnot instead.
[15:48:00] <chazy> yes, still a bit misleading
[17:07:47] <karezza> I'm working to create a chrome plugin to modify a website I'm visiting.  For troubleshooting I have it on a loop every 10 seconds writing to the console.  I can see the script runs every 10 seconds.  Yet, I can't seem to locate the element I am trying to modify.  I can see if I right-click on the page and do an Inspection that the element is
[17:07:48] <karezza> there, but neither raw javascript nor jquery seems to find it.  The easiest way to find it is to locate a <tr class=LookingForThis>.  Now, if I right click on the page and do view source, I do not see the element I'm looking for, if that matters.
[17:08:29] <karezza> What I want to do is find that TR and then append a TD on the end with a button in it.
[17:08:56] <robertmaxrees> how are you trying to select the element?
[17:09:05] <karezza> I have code that works in fiddler, so not sure what the deal is
[17:09:32] <karezza> My latest attempt looks like this:     var elements = $("#main_body").find('.x-toolbar-left-row')
[17:09:59] <karezza> the body element looks like "<body id=main_body ..."
[17:10:15] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you just do console.log($('.x-toolbar-left-row').length)?
[17:10:29] <karezza> testing, one minute
[17:12:18] <karezza> I get 3, but there should be > than 26 .
[17:12:42] <karezza> It's the 25 one that I'm interested in
[17:13:06] <robertmaxrees> erm.  can you show your code in a fiddle that shows what you're trying to do?  you may not be targeting the element you think you are.
[17:14:12] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind, hitting "view source" or anything similar isn't representative of what the JS is able to see.
[17:14:20] <karezza> https://jsfiddle.net/r90ks4ed/
[17:14:29] <karezza> it works there though
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> because the DOM matches the markup you see.
[17:14:48] <robertmaxrees> DOM != markup.
[17:15:49] <robertmaxrees> so explain your end goal.  what are you trying to select, and what are you trying to do with it once you select it?
[17:18:13] <karezza> I want to add a button to a web page that can add some functionality to the page.  If I could search for a Button with the contents "Bookmark" that would also work as there is an existing button which I'd like to put my button next to.  Currently I'm searching for the <TR> element using the class name, as this will work if I can access the 25th
[17:18:13] <karezza> instance.  Have been working on this as I could get the button search to be successful either.
[17:18:22] <robertmaxrees> slow down :)
[17:18:28] <robertmaxrees> simplify it :)
[17:18:36] <karezza> ok
[17:18:51] <robertmaxrees> start with step one: you want to find a button whose text says "Bookmark"?
[17:18:58] <karezza> I'm wanting to wait for the page to load and then find an element to put a button next to
[17:19:02] <karezza> that would work
[17:19:56] <robertmaxrees> $('button').filter(functuon() {return $(this).text().toLowerCase() === 'bookmark'}).length;
[17:19:57] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[17:25:16] <karezza> I get a '1' on the fiddler page and a '0' on the page I'm trying to get to work
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> *jsfiddle, fwiw.  fiddler is something else.
[17:25:43] <karezza> oh, yes, jsfiddle
[17:25:51] <robertmaxrees> what if you just do $('button').length?
[17:26:06] <robertmaxrees> iirc chrome extensions require some special handling for this kind of stuff.
[17:27:16] <karezza> 20
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> then there is no button whose text is just "bookmark" :/
[17:27:44] <robertmaxrees> unless you need to .trim() the text as well.
[17:28:15] <karezza> It could be something chrome extension related, but I'm pretty sure I've been able to eliminate that as a variable
[17:28:31] <karezza> I could try displaying the content of each button, maybe that will help ... one minute
[17:35:27] <karezza> Interesting, I can see the 20 buttons.  They are from the first row of the web page up top.
[17:36:31] <karezza> $.each($('button'), function(index, value) { console.log(value) });
[17:36:50] <robertmaxrees> don't use $.each btw :)
[17:37:22] <robertmaxrees> $('button').each
[17:37:22] <karezza> really?  I got it from here https://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/
[17:37:26] <karezza> oops
[17:37:28] <karezza> forget I did that
[17:37:30] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:37:34] <karezza> lol
[17:38:33] <karezza> In any case, jquery seems to be trying, and the it is seeing data on the page which makes me think it isn't anything related to the context of a chrome extension.
[17:38:52] <karezza> It's like ... what if there is a frame in use, could that be causing this?
[17:39:13] <karezza> What is odd to me is that a right-click and Inspection shows everything ... I would expect jquery to have the same view
[17:40:03] <robertmaxrees> it does
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> if it's in the inspector pane, jquery can "see" it.
[17:40:21] <robertmaxrees> can you link to the page??
[17:40:36] <karezza> I cannot
[17:41:01] <karezza> well, let me see if i might find a demo somewhere real quick
[17:41:58] <karezza> not seeing that possibility
[17:42:16] * karezza scratches his head
[17:43:56] <robertmaxrees> :/
[17:45:38] <karezza> I did all the same stuff using JavaScript, was hoping jquery might succeed
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> and it worked with the non-jquery js?
[17:46:10] <robertmaxrees> can you show what that code looked like?
[17:46:11] <karezza> no ...
[17:46:17] <robertmaxrees> :/
[17:46:20] <karezza> it didn't work
[17:46:41] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like maybe there's a misunderstanding around how JS works.
[17:46:51] <karezza> I have been theorizing that maybe there is a frame involved and perhaps I need to loop through those or something, was hoping jquery wouldn't care and it would just work
[17:47:00] <karezza> could be
[17:47:12] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript fwiw.
[17:47:37] <karezza> I became obsessed with jquery a few years ago and did a lot, but haven't really touched anything JavaScript for quite some time
[17:47:58] <karezza> ya, that's my understand, was just hoping ... ya know, magic and it would work
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> you said frames might be involved?
[17:48:17] <karezza> yes, pretty sure
[17:48:27] <robertmaxrees> that would be your issue.
[17:48:32] <robertmaxrees> neec to use .contents()
[17:48:42] <robertmaxrees> so long as it's not cross-domain, it'll work.
[17:48:48] <karezza> !!!
[17:49:44] <karezza> everything should be onprem
[17:51:08] <robertmaxrees> location doesn't matter - the domain does.
[18:00:14] <karezza> definately "iframe" s involved
[18:17:17] <karezza> Not sure about contents just yet but what about $('iframe') which is returning 3 results, seems I could maybe search each one of them?
[18:21:50] <robertmaxrees> karezza start by looking at the iframes proper - does the one you care about have a class or something you can select on?
[18:22:37] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, i'd wonder if you could just do $('iframe').contents().find('.foo')
[18:32:39] <karezza> found it!
[18:32:43] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:32:47] <karezza> now to clean up the code
[18:35:40] <karezza> console.log("%: "+ $('iframe').contents().find("button:contains('Bookmark')").length)
[18:35:58] <robertmaxrees> so btw - get away from those kinds of selectors :)
[18:36:20] <robertmaxrees> they get unreadable quick.  get into using .filter() with a function.  much more flexible and ultimately more readable :)
[18:36:32] <karezza> ok
[18:36:38] <karezza> I'll look into that
[18:37:07] <robertmaxrees> find('button').filter(function() { return $(this).text().toLowerCase() === 'bookmark'});
[18:37:08] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:38:19] <karezza> haha, it's like the old days with a hex edito
[18:38:23] <karezza> *editor
[18:38:47] <robertmaxrees> nah, more like the modern days where we don't cram everything into a CSS selector ;)
[18:40:31] <karezza> I'll have to figure out how to do it without a loop retrying every few seconds
[18:40:44] <robertmaxrees> why are you looping it?
[18:40:58] <robertmaxrees> are you waiting until the iframe loads?
[18:41:03] <karezza> it's like the chrome extension only loads once
[18:41:19] <karezza> and i have to browse a copule pages to get to the page i want to have effected
[18:41:53] <karezza> I'll put some time into it, probably going to be more chrome extension specific
[18:42:00] <karezza> Thank you for your help
[18:42:02] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[18:42:06] <robertmaxrees> sure!  what we're here for :)
