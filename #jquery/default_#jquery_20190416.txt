[10:12:12] <jak2000> hi all
[10:12:25] <jak2000> any library for draw charts i am interested in 3dPie
[10:27:11] <makr8100> jak2000: http://www.humblesoftware.com/flotr2/
[10:27:28] <makr8100> not sure if that's 3d enough for you but I've had good luck with this lib
[10:32:40] <makr8100> jak2000: https://www.highcharts.com/demo/3d-pie
[10:32:46] <makr8100> last one isn't free though
[10:40:47] <jak2000> checking
[10:42:59] <jak2000> makr8100 beautiful but isnt free?
[11:00:58] <makr8100> jak2000: highcharts is a paid library, flotr2 is free
[11:06:27] <jak2000> thanks makr8100
[11:45:05] <Noldorin> Does anyone know why `this` is the HTML document here? Seems wrong. https://gist.github.com/a4bc2e0d4d900dca4f1791f74815b32c
[11:45:18] <robertmaxrees> because you're using an arrow function.
[11:45:39] <robertmaxrees> that's half the reason you use them, in fact :)
[11:46:34] <Noldorin> robertmaxrees, oh, how do you mean?
[11:46:49] <Noldorin> they avoid changing `this`?
[11:46:52] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[11:47:21] <Noldorin> aha
[11:47:22] <Noldorin> thanks
[11:47:59] <robertmaxrees> the 'this' in an arrow function is the same of the enclosing lexical scope.  it doesn't allow for .bind(), which jquery uses to set 'this'
[11:48:30] <robertmaxrees> you could pass the two args to filter to get the element though.
[11:48:47] <robertmaxrees> .filter((index, element) => { console.log($(element)) });
[11:48:53] <robertmaxrees> get you basically the same thing.
[11:48:59] <Noldorin> makes sense
[11:49:12] <Noldorin> what's considered the more conventional solution?
[11:49:25] <robertmaxrees> depends on your codebase :)
[11:49:49] <robertmaxrees> are you using babel and compiling down?  do you need to support browsers that doesn't support arrow functions?
[11:50:10] <Noldorin> using babel yeah
[11:50:25] <robertmaxrees> then choose whichever you like more, but be consistent.
[11:50:27] <Noldorin> existing code uses function() mainly, now that I look closer, but I don't mind changing that
[11:50:28] <Noldorin> fair
[11:53:20] <Noldorin> robertmaxrees, can I do something like `reduce` with jQuery?
[11:54:10] <robertmaxrees> erm
[11:54:19] <robertmaxrees> for elements?
[11:55:52] <robertmaxrees> that seems like a strange thing to want to do.
[11:56:45] <robertmaxrees> Noldorin
[11:57:01] <Noldorin> yeah for elements
[11:57:04] <Noldorin> it's a little unusual
[11:57:18] <Noldorin> but the idea is to find the "topmost" element
[11:57:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not a job for reduce though?
[11:57:58] <robertmaxrees> since you're not accumulating anything.  sounds like you want .filter()
[11:59:00] <Noldorin> accumulating the minimum height
[11:59:06] <Noldorin> minimum top position*
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see an example.
[12:00:01] <robertmaxrees> 'cause in that case, i'd .map().get() over the collection to get a normal array of numbers and then .reduce() against that.
[12:00:55] <Noldorin> yeah, the issue is I want to end up with the topmost *element*, not the position of the topmost element
[12:00:56] <robertmaxrees> most jquery methods attached to the return of $() assume you want jquery objects out the other end, hence why it doesn't have a reduce.
[12:01:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd still have to see what you're doing.
[12:02:57] <Noldorin> mhm
[12:06:17] <Noldorin> (let me see...)
[14:30:33] <hunnybUns> hello?
[14:30:45] <Taplar> aloha
[14:30:51] <robertmaxrees> http://www.nohello.com/ :)
[14:31:10] <Taplar> woah, there's a website for that?
[14:31:34] <hunnybUns> how do you accept cors?
[14:31:35] <robertmaxrees> yep!
[14:31:44] <Taplar> The server has to be configured to accept it
[14:31:44] <hunnybUns> im getting cross origin error in the console
[14:31:45] <robertmaxrees> hunnybUns you have to configure your server for it.
[14:31:58] <hunnybUns> how do i do that?
[14:32:17] <robertmaxrees> search google for "how to enable cors"
[14:32:21] <Taplar> You'd have to ask in a room related to your server/application language
[14:32:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:32:38] <hunnybUns> Taplar: im using jquery
[14:32:43] <Taplar> that's not a server language
[14:32:53] <robertmaxrees> hunnybUns the issue isn't caused by jquery
[14:32:56] <hunnybUns> Taplar: i dont have a server
[14:33:06] <robertmaxrees> hunnybUns then you can't solve this problem.
[14:33:08] <Taplar> you do, your ajax is making a request to a server
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> the server you're calling to needs to allow cors
[14:33:25] <hunnybUns> Taplar: how do i configure it?
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> search google.
[14:33:32] <hunnybUns> do i have to send headers?
[14:33:41] <robertmaxrees> hunnybUns you can't fix it from jquery.
[14:33:41] <Taplar> no, cors cannot be overcome with javascript alone
[14:33:56] <Taplar> it's a security mechanism to prevent ajax from accessing stuff it should not
[14:34:07] <Taplar> if javascript could circumvent it, not much of a security mechanism
[14:34:21] <hunnybUns> Taplar: i dont understand what you mean
[14:34:39] <hunnybUns> how do i create cors on the server if i dont have one
[14:34:41] <Taplar> CORS is security around not allowing other websites for accessing your data
[14:34:51] <Taplar> unless you say it's ok
[14:35:13] <Taplar> if you say, no you can use this, and then javascript had a way of saying, NO I CAN....
[14:35:20] <Taplar> *shrug*
[14:35:20] <hunnybUns> Taplar: its a api
[14:35:27] <Taplar> doesn't mean it's a public api
[14:35:49] <Taplar> lots of apis require some form of authentication
[14:35:52] <hunnybUns> Taplar: what? it is
[14:36:04] <Taplar> if you are getting CORS errors, no, it's not
[14:36:11] <Taplar> or you are calling it incorrectly
[14:36:18] <hunnybUns> Taplar: ok if you say
[14:37:15] <makr8100> hunnybUns: try https://learn.jquery.com/ajax/working-with-jsonp/
[14:37:21] <Taplar> If there is documentation on the API, i would reference it to make sure you are calling it correctly, and see if there is any sort of token you need to pass to access it
[14:37:27] <makr8100> but if the api you're calling has implemented security you won't get far
[14:37:43] <makr8100> if you try to just access json it won't work, has to be jsonp
[14:37:52] <Taplar> yep
[14:38:13] <makr8100> everything else said applies too, but only after you've implemented jsonp
[14:38:32] <Taplar> which not every endpoint implements jsonp
[14:46:08] <Taplar> egh, i didn't realise for a bit there that the user talking changed, X(.  Still not use to this irc change
[15:04:33] <robertBusy> oh?  new client?
[15:04:58] <Taplar> eh, same kiwiirc, but they forced the old client interface to their new one
[15:05:02] <Taplar> a bit different
[15:05:15] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:05:47] <Taplar> for a while i had the old one bookmarked, and i'd go to their website and they'd send me to the new one, but the bookmark would still work.  but the other day they started auto forwarding
[15:07:18] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[15:07:43] <Taplar> i'm one of those users that keeps using old stuff until they force me to change, XD
[15:08:22] <robertmaxrees> hah, users like you are a big pita for our mobile app.
[15:08:35] <Taplar> yeah i can imagine
[15:19:31] <robertmaxrees> jfc i'm so full.
[15:19:54] <Taplar> had to have the snickers, eh?
[15:20:48] <robertmaxrees> hah.  before the diet i ordered pretty regularly from the food truck that's here today.  and it was always just the right amount of food.  but now?  i feel like i overate.
[15:21:03] <Taplar> what kind of food truck?
[15:21:37] <Taplar> and that's good, if you feel like you could cut back on portion size
[15:21:39] <robertmaxrees> his menu changes all the time.  usually does a quesadilla, a sandwich, and a salad of some kind.
[15:21:54] <robertmaxrees> oh my portion sizes are super small these days.
[15:23:21] <Taplar> i'm thinking about trying to ditch the occasional sweet tea, though really my next target should probably be trying to cut back on cheese
[15:23:54] <robertmaxrees> oh?  lots of cheese?
[15:24:08] <Taplar> lol, pretty much if it has the option for extra cheese, i'm probably going to get it
[15:24:14] <robertmaxrees> hah
[15:24:19] <robertmaxrees> okay okay.
[15:25:20] <Taplar> i don't go into subway much anymore since avoiding the bread.  but the occasion i do go in i'll get the meatball, with double cheese and mozerella
[15:26:11] <robertmaxrees> but... mozzarella is cheese?
[15:26:18] <Taplar> yeaaaaaah!
[15:26:25] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean double cheese and add mozz
[15:26:29] <Taplar> crap, sorry, parmesean
[15:26:32] <Taplar> (sp)
[15:26:34] <robertmaxrees> ooooh hahahahaha
[15:26:39] <salad> oh hi there
[15:26:45] <Taplar> fk, it's a salad...
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[15:26:52] <Taplar> what's up?
[15:26:59] <salad> mixin
[15:27:03] <robertmaxrees> i accidentally pinged them :)
[15:27:07] <Taplar> ah
[15:32:08] <makr8100> looks like salad...  got tossed.  YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
[15:32:13] <makr8100> ok I'll see myself out
[15:32:16] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:32:42] <Taplar> that salad just got ranchy
[15:33:12] <robertmaxrees> makr8100 no need to leaf.  just out - lettuce talk a big more :)_
[15:33:28] <Taplar> ^_^
[15:33:44] <makr8100> off topic for channel but salad related perhaps?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD8nzgZa0gU
[15:34:42] <Taplar> lol, i was thoroughly confused.  the lead in video was a chicken sandwich promo, and i was like...wtf?
[15:36:00] <Taplar> lol, emergency stop.  i have jokes for that
[15:43:12] <makr8100> for when it's tossing your salad a bit too much?
[15:43:18] <robertmaxrees> okay okay okay heh
[15:45:23] <dur117> Hi guys, I was wondering if someone could help me figure out a possible jq equivalent of a simple sed replace I'm doing. Is there a simple find/replace function I can use with jq? Currently using: curl -s http://127.0.0.1:80/status/ | jq .[] -r | sed "s/old/new/"
[15:45:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:45:53] <Taplar> sed replace?
[15:46:14] <makr8100> sed is a linux command but I've only used it a few times
[15:46:21] <makr8100> pretty much a search replace
[15:46:31] <robertmaxrees> dur117 you realize jq isn't jquery, yeah?
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> assuming you're looking at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
[15:47:19] <dur117> my bad, sorry guys :D
[15:47:23] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:47:33] <makr8100> ah I didn't know about jq, thought you were just abbreviating a lot
[15:47:49] <robertmaxrees> terrible name for a package.
[15:47:54] <makr8100> I was going to link to standard js replace cuz why use jquery for that?
[15:48:12] <Taplar> because it all has to be jquery
[15:48:18] <Taplar> everything!!!!
[15:48:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:48:44] <Taplar> need to get an id?  $(this).prop('id')!!!!  There's no other way!
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:49:48] <Taplar> or more often than not.  $(this).is(':checked')
[15:49:59] <robertmaxrees> yuck
[15:50:02] <Taplar> :)
[15:50:17] <Taplar> i feel like i'm the only guy on SO telling people to stop that, lol
[16:22:08] <Taplar> you know Lego tried to get a contract with my local highway department, but they kept running into road blocks.
[16:22:19] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahaha
[16:22:52] <Taplar> they have some crazy lego car videos
[19:39:04] <twmaffun> hi, i have a jquery-enabled webpage that displays 1) a single object and 2) a control box that lists many buttons, each representing an action a user can take on the object. now, i'm trying to create a new page that lists many objects at once, where each object still has its own control box
[19:40:25] <twmaffun> the problem is the way i wrote my jquery was such that it assumes there's only one object on the page.  is there a way to isolate parts of my HTML so that jquery only looks for selectors inside a html container?
[19:42:11] <twmaffun> i.e. some way to specify that jquery code within a certain code block should only search for elements inside a specific HTML container?
[20:15:19] <znf> twmaffun, it's much easier to understand what you want to do when you show the code
[20:15:24] <znf> make a fiddle
