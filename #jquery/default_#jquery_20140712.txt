[00:52:19] <gry> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ doesn't show how to _make_ a new dialog… where do I head now?
[00:54:59] <gry> I found http://imperavi.com/redactor/examples/uidialog/ but the default documentation should be more self-sufficient I believe…
[01:12:44] <iDevelop> Hi guys
[01:13:04] <iDevelop> How do you make it so that you have one <span></span> and the word inside it fades out and in, with a new word each time
[01:13:06] <iDevelop> e.g.
[01:13:45] <iDevelop> <p>Our website is <span id="adjective">awesome</span></p> — make "awesome" change so "amazing", "easy to use" etc etc
[01:13:59] <iDevelop> But with a sleek transition, where it fades out and in for each word.
[01:43:36] <SnowDent> Hello people of JQuery
[01:44:10] <SnowDent> hi
[01:44:35] <DHowett> SnowDent: hundreds of people enter and leave here every day, you shouldn't have to greet them all. it'll be tiring work!
[01:44:39] <DHowett> SnowDent: (also, hi!)
[01:45:34] <SnowDent> Haha okay fine
[01:46:54] <SnowDent> Anyways I had a quick question, I'm trying to make an ajax GET request with jquery, but jquery keeps appending "&callback=fback&_=1405154784284" to the URL, which causes the page to not accept it
[01:47:18] <SnowDent> Is there a way to prevent JQuery from temporarily not appending to the URL
[01:49:15] <sacho> SnowDent, show some code
[01:50:41] <hadifarnoud> there was a js datepicker in which it shows Year, I pick a year. then shows month, I pick a month. And then day. it was so easy to pick a date, compared to traditional datepicker. I can't seem to find it. anyone knows what I'm talking about?
[01:51:22] <SnowDent> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=SPQIdceh7p
[01:52:33] <sacho> oh, it's not a get, it's jsonp
[01:52:42] <sacho> everything jquery is sending is practically required
[01:52:53] <sacho> the _ parameter is to bust caches
[01:53:06] <sacho> so why is this site not accepting your request
[01:53:13] <SnowDent> well the website just doesn't like it
[01:53:16] <SnowDent> it returns an error
[01:53:18] <DHowett> But the server might not be equipped to return jsonp and handle related incoming params.
[01:53:25] <SnowDent> yeah exactly
[01:53:35] <sacho> well, then you can't use jsonp
[01:53:49] <SnowDent> but don't I have to in order to make a cross domain request
[01:53:53] <DHowett> aha, looks like data.sparkfun.com is expecting jsonp callback params.
[01:54:45] <DHowett> however: it doesn't seem as though their examples include the data in the URI.
[01:55:20] <DHowett> that data has to go in the body. try putting it in data: in the request and removing the type.
[01:55:23] <SnowDent> Not on public docs, but once you create a stream
[01:55:25] <sacho> SnowDent, you're getting a 401 response
[01:55:29] <sacho> looks like you need to auth
[01:55:38] <sacho> or are pointing at the wrong url
[01:55:48] <DHowett> sacho: with a private_key of "NOPE" i'd expect that
[01:55:53] <sacho> ah, I didn't see it :)
[01:55:57] <sacho> so, what error *are* you getting
[01:56:06] <DHowett> SnowDent: oh, I get it
[01:56:11] <iDevelop> 09:12 (iDevelop) Hi guys
[01:56:11] <iDevelop> 09:13 (iDevelop) How do you make it so that you have one <span></span> and the word inside it fades out and in, with a new word each time
[01:56:11] <iDevelop> 09:13 (iDevelop) e.g.
[01:56:11] <iDevelop> 09:13 ← ^esc (~esc-ape@178.115.128.166.wireless.dyn.drei.com) has left IRC: (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
[01:56:11] <iDevelop> 09:13 (iDevelop) <p>Our website is <span id="adjective">awesome</span></p> — make "awesome" change so "amazing", "easy to use" etc etc
[01:56:12] <iDevelop> 09:14 (iDevelop) But with a sleek transition, where it fades out and in for each word.
[01:56:13] <SnowDent> No I get 400 Response, and site shows: "0 _ is not a valid field for this stream.   expecting: Team_A_Score, Team_B_Score"
[01:56:19] <DHowett> SnowDent: you can either POST and get jsonp, or you can GET and not set jsonp callback parameters.
[01:56:24] <DHowett> SnowDent: you cannot do both at the same time :)
[01:57:06] <SnowDent> lol so what I want to do is impossible?!
[01:57:28] <sacho> post?jsonp
[01:57:30] <sacho> huh?
[01:57:37] <DHowett> SnowDent: no..
[01:57:46] <systemfault> jsonp = get javascript using <script>,it’s an ugly hack.
[01:57:48] <SnowDent> I don't need to get any data back
[01:58:04] <DHowett> then you should remove the jsonp  dataType and callback.
[01:58:24] <DHowett> your two options are "Send everything in GET request parameters", or "Send a POST with a jsonp callback, and put your data in the request body."
[01:58:38] <SnowDent> "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access. " is the new error I will get
[01:58:40] <DHowett> what you are doing is "Send a POST with the data in query parameters"
[01:59:14] <DHowett> Then you will just have to use jsonp post with a callback, put your data in the body, and have the callback do nothing
[01:59:22] <systemfault> stop it with the jsonp post
[01:59:29] <systemfault> There’s no such thing.
[02:00:10] <DHowett> systemfault: okay, then, i'll just fall back to saying "A post setting the jsonp query parameters, making sure you've set up $.ajax to expect a JSONP response in return" if that makes things any clearer
[02:01:36] <iDevelop> My question is getting ignored again :(
[02:02:00] <DHowett> systemfault: just to confirm. would that be an acceptable use of bytes here? or can I go back to the abbreviated version.
[02:02:21] <systemfault> DHowett: Simply.. JSONP and POST are mutually exclusive.
[02:02:37] <systemfault> Because of how JSONP works.
[02:05:32] <DHowett> systemfault: ah, sorry -- the Phant API requests that you POST with callback params
[02:06:58] <hadifarnoud> looking for a datepicker. the one I'm talking about show you just years in first step, you click and then shows you just months, and finally day. in UX perspective, it's much faster and easier
[02:07:10] <hadifarnoud> you know what its called? I cant find it again
[02:07:52] <sacho> DHowett, I don't see what it plans to do with these "callback" parameters - the api just seems broken
[02:09:20] <DHowett> systemfault: (my apologies for being snappy.)
[02:09:31] <systemfault> All cool :)
[02:12:44] <SnowDent> Hey guys I got it
[02:12:47] <DHowett> sacho: that is a good question, tbh: it looks like they included it as an afterthought
[02:13:00] <DHowett> SnowDent: what was the solution?
[02:13:14] <SnowDent> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=SPQIdceh7p
[02:13:35] <SnowDent> Which I got from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10955213/ajax-jsonp-call-automatically-adding-callback-parameter-how-to-remove-that
[02:13:56] <SnowDent> It stops jquery from appending stuff to url
[02:15:16] <DHowett> doesn't that just make it "not jsonp"?
[02:15:20] <sacho> you're gonna have cache problems
[02:15:48] <sacho> hopefully you don't need to call the same url more than once
[02:15:48] <sacho> :)
[02:17:30] <DHowett> oh, I see: it's still jsonp without the ability to set the callback name
[02:17:31] <DHowett> neat
[02:17:59] <SnowDent> Yeah I don't think I'll ever have to call exact same URL twice, so it should work out!
[02:18:11] <SnowDent> Will only be called when a team's score is incremented
[02:30:25] <berpcor|2> http://laravel.io/bin/BjJVa
[02:30:33] <berpcor|2> How to insert pause.
[02:35:25] <systemfault> setTimeout(function() { theTwoLinesThatNeedsToBeExecutedAfter2Seconds }, 2000);
[02:35:28] <systemfault> berpcor|2: ^
[02:36:37] <systemfault> http://laravel.io/bin/kan00
[02:39:10] <berpcor|2> systemfault: Thank you. I did it exactly the same way... this time I found an error. It is about this...
[02:39:41] <systemfault> Read the updated laravel.io
[02:39:54] <systemfault> See how I’m handling the this
[02:48:44] <sarkis> hey all, $.ajax shouldn't be forwarding to the action right?
[02:49:04] <sarkis> or i should say the url: param
[02:55:50] <sarkis> https://gist.github.com/sarkis/0aa367187cb3c3e1c754
[02:55:55] <sarkis> is something like that possible ^^
[02:56:16] <sarkis> the 2 $.ajax
[02:56:49] <arthurvr> that's possible
[02:57:24] <sarkis> so for some reason, when i submit the form, i end up at /feedback
[02:57:34] <sarkis> and i see the json :(
[03:02:14] <arthurvr> is that 'success' key in your json?
[03:02:55] <sarkis> yes
[03:03:03] <sarkis> "success": false
[03:04:23] <sarkis> https://gist.github.com/sarkis/0aa367187cb3c3e1c754
[03:04:33] <sarkis> i updated with the json i see on the page.. this is weird..
[03:06:37] <arthurvr> maybe try adding dataType:'json' to your $.ajax call
[03:06:40] <sarkis> arthurvr: the whole point of $.ajax is so this doesn't happen right?
[03:06:55] <sarkis> i tried that, let me try again though
[03:07:47] <sarkis> same thing :(
[03:10:23] <fedora_newb> Does anyone know how to append the data from this plugin? https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll
[03:10:57] <fedora_newb> The url gets called, I can see the data being returned in the firebug console but I can't seem to get it put into the content. :/
[03:16:25] <sarkis> so confused on what else to try :/
[03:22:24] <sarkis> arthurvr: do i have to say return false somewhere so it doesn't try to actually load /feedback/?
[03:23:16] <arthurvr> i dont think so
[03:27:36] <fedora_newb> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll anyone know how to append the data to a certain div on this plugin... docs aren't that great and can't seem to find an answer anywhere on google :/
[04:18:38] <berpcor|2> http://laravel.io/bin/GoB4k
[04:28:49] <systemfault> If you need to deal with time, you need setTimeout. Writing you don’t need it in your paste doesn’t change that reality.
[04:30:50] <fedora_newb> https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/ anyone familiar with that plugin?
[04:31:07] <fedora_newb> Trying to figure out how to append the data to an element
[04:31:48] <wfq> hi guys
[04:33:17] <wfq> how do I call a rule that has a custom methods with parameters please? Please see example: http://pastebin.com/KLqscnHe. As is it returns always false
[04:40:56] <wfq> is there anyone around please? Just don't know what is going on
[04:43:00] <wfq> unless I input the old value it is always wrong
[04:43:12] <wfq> it doesn't make sense
[04:48:18] <wfq> it was comparing string with integers
[05:08:18] <emx> how do i set afetrclose callback on a running instance of fancybox?
[05:25:07] <percolate> Hey guys, I'm trying to make a tooltip visible when a certain text is highlighted on the page.
[05:25:42] <percolate> How can I go about doing this? Is there a way I can detect when a user highlights a text on the page?
[05:50:00] <wfq> by doing this: $("input[name='bidIncrement']").val($("input[name='minBidAmount']")) I am setting the value of minBidAmount to bidIncrement, am not I? bidIncrement is hidden
[05:50:08] <wfq> what am I missing here?
[06:01:34] <sacho> wfq, other way around
[06:01:48] <sacho> actually, not even that
[06:02:20] <sacho> you have $bidIncrement.val($bidAmount) -> setting the value of $bidIncrement to $bidAmount
[06:02:28] <sacho> except $bidAmount is a jquery collection
[06:02:50] <sacho> so perhaps what you want to do is $bidAmount.val($bidIncrement.val())
[06:03:02] <percolate> sacho: Can ya help me out?
[06:03:21] <sacho> use the hover event
[06:03:38] <percolate> sacho: http://jsfiddle.net/ds2Vg/1/ - Why isn't the tool tip displaying on top of the text and it's acting a bit buggy when the highlight is off.
[06:07:01] <percolate> sacho: any suggestions?
[07:46:10] <cannap> Hi can any tell me how i can make something like the example image http://jsfiddle.net/9M2ep/19/ here
[07:46:27] <cannap> i want to place a text left under a text-align center text
[07:48:29] <systemfault> cannap: If the h1 can have a fixed width, it’s easy
[07:48:55] <cannap> hmm
[08:25:31] <Zal> cannap: you could potentially use the jQueryUI position method: http://api.jqueryui.com/position/
[08:25:52] <Zal> although it feels like overkill :)
[09:07:16] <Zal> Just started looking through the jQuery source and noticed there seems to be a preference for comments instead of private semantic micro-methods. Is this an optimisation?
[09:07:51] <Zal> i.e. to reduce minified file size
[09:10:50] <Zal> In simpler terms: there's a lot of massive methods, divided by comments. Why? :D
[09:48:02] <zagaza> hi. how come my masonry "crashes" when i jquery.load a page containing masonry items?
[09:48:54] <jParkton> Illuminatus!!
[09:49:35] <systemfault> Probably Jesus or Allah
[09:50:09] <jParkton> ^
[10:04:18] <frank_o> I got some pretty cool JS that will attach iScroll to all containers with the `data-iscroll` HTML attribute: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/19/
[10:04:21] <frank_o> But since that fiddle has two instances of iScroll, how do I call `myScroll.refresh();` on each of them?
[10:05:41] <frank_o> * on only one of them?
[10:11:33] <krambiorix> how can i validate a field for allowing only numbers and dots?
[10:33:32] <Zal> I have an idea of a good fix for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15160 but I don't have time to implement it today, how quickly do these types of bugs get fixed normally?
[10:34:16] <decx> 5 minutes to 5 years
[10:34:22] <Zal> fair enough :)
[10:34:52] <decx> #jquery-dev has active contributors who are glad for any help
[10:35:10] <Zal> ah great, thanks decx
[10:35:44] <decx> krambiorix have you tried googling, regex dots and numbers? ;)
[10:39:48] <krambiorix> when focussing a field i want to add dots every 3 numbers... $(this).val().replace(/^(\d{3})(\d{3})(\d{3})/, "$1.$2.$3");  -> doesn't do anything...
[10:41:12] <decx> so you don't want to validate but use a pattern on input
[10:47:14] <mdev> easy way to loop through all <div class="md"><p>'s
[10:47:20] <mdev> I want to filter the content with jquery
[10:47:38] <decx> what all ps in .md? or all .mds with p`?
[10:48:01] <mdev> all <p>'s for all md classes
[10:48:06] <mdev> is only 1 <p> per md class
[10:48:23] <decx> $('p','.md')
[10:48:23] <mdev> just basically loop through all md classes and access their <p> inside
[10:48:30] <mdev> thanks
[10:56:12] <frank_o> Hi! Is there a more DRY way of writing this little snippet? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/FrvD3/
[10:56:33] <decx> what's with the global variables
[10:58:00] <decx> look at the options
[10:58:02] <frank_o> I think it's the standard way of initializing iScroll. Plus I need them for later.
[10:58:07] <decx> { ... }
[10:58:18] <decx> just set them beforehand to an option object
[10:58:23] <frank_o> Ooh
[10:58:25] <decx> new IScroll(wrapper.get(0), options)
[10:58:26] <frank_o> I like the sound of that!
[11:01:50] <frank_o> decx: Pardon me but exactly how do I store them in an object? You mean like an array or something like .data()?
[11:02:20] <decx> come on
[11:02:22] <decx> you know that
[11:02:26] <decx> var object = { blah: true, notblah: false }
[11:02:36] <frank_o> Cheers :)
[11:03:09] <CrowX-> frank_o, it should be something like this http://jsfiddle.net/FrvD3/1/
[11:03:39] <frank_o> I got http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/FrvD3/2/ hold on let me check yours CrowX-
[11:03:59] <decx> object is not options
[11:04:12] <frank_o> decx: Minor typo my bad
[11:04:16] <frank_o> CrowX-: interesting stuff there
[11:05:03] <frank_o> Damn
[11:05:11] <frank_o> This is like choosing between blonde and brunette :confused:
[11:06:46] <CrowX-> http://jsfiddle.net/FrvD3/3/
[11:06:52] <CrowX-> i had some minor mistake earlier
[11:07:26] <frank_o> CrowX-: just some missing curly brackets right?
[11:07:46] <CrowX-> i had some needless ones unclosed
[11:08:20] <frank_o> Beautiful solution though
[11:08:22] <frank_o> Thanks a lot
[11:08:24] <frank_o> You too decx !
[11:15:22] <frank_o> CrowX-: if I may disturb the peace some more -- I seem to be getting undefined for myScrollOne: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/29/
[11:16:07] <frank_o> Maybe jquery dislikes me passing a variable name as a function argument?
[11:22:58] <sarkis> hey all, i have this being done in a link on my site: data-toggle="dropdown"
[11:23:18] <sarkis> what's the easiest way to toggle that somewhere else?
[11:23:36] <sarkis> i tried $('.dropdown').toggle(), didn't do what i want
[11:24:12] <decx> don't select by data attribute
[11:26:04] <sarkis> h,,
[11:26:14] <sarkis> i think this is bootstraps doing
[11:26:51] <CrowX-> frank_o, where have you defined myScrollOne?
[11:28:00] <CrowX-> oh I see it's probably in the iscroll.js external script, right?
[11:29:20] <sarkis> decx: how would you toggle off?
[11:29:49] <sarkis> decx: the dropdown brings up a form, i want to toggle it if the form submits right, i have it all done, just need to figure out the last part of toggling
[11:31:47] <frank_o> CrowX-: No it's not in iscroll.js. I tried with `var myScrollOne, myScrollTwo;` but no luck when trying to do myScrollOne.refresh(); from the below function. I guess they're not translated into global variables after passing through `someFunction`
[11:40:35] <CrowX-> frank_o, give me a link to a script where they're defined
[11:40:41] <CrowX-> so I could see what you're doing wrong
[11:41:05] <frank_o> CrowX-: one sec. Just gotta fix some other messed up logic first
[11:44:08] <frank_o> CrowX-: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/38/
[11:45:00] <frank_o> just got decx's version working flawlessly though: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/36/show (use Chrome's mobile emulator for those touchend events)

[13:20:45] <mdev> when it's relatively small?
[13:26:40] <mikechelen> in jquery mobile, how do you persist a search form (including current input) across jqm pages?
[13:34:23] <kurion> If I tell a button to onclick use a function, can it use functions that are inside $(document).ready()?
[13:36:05] <djQuery> bored
[13:36:11] <djQuery> give me something to fix
[13:36:18] <kurion> http://jsfiddle.net/zera/z4J85/2/
[13:36:24] <kurion> Just what you need :)
[13:36:34] <kurion> For some reason, the button won't call functions I've defined.
[13:36:58] <djQuery> yooo kurion I made a whole snake game outa that the other day
[13:37:07] <djQuery> ditched the fade stuff though
[13:37:17] <kurion> Hehe I think I glimpsed through it a bit
[13:38:25] <djQuery> kurion, got bored with it though
[13:38:26] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/yicun/3/edit
[13:38:30] <jeffreylevesque> In addition to Uglify, sass, imagemin, what other awesome tools can I use to make my web application top of the line
[13:38:42] <kurion> Ohh, this is more advanced than what I saw
[13:39:06] <djQuery> kurion, whats the issue with yours?
[13:39:07] <RandalSchwartz> safari console says "can't find variable test"
[13:39:22] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz, outa scope?
[13:39:49] <RandalSchwartz> doesn't look like it at furst
[13:39:53] <RandalSchwartz> not sure what's going on
[13:39:55] <djQuery> kurion, whats up with the table?
[13:40:10] <kurion> oh the table holds the divs
[13:40:26] <kurion> For some reason the button I made when called onclick doesn't call any functions I've made
[13:40:41] <RandalSchwartz> and yeah, test isn't defined... weird.
[13:41:33] <djQuery> kurion, are you dead set on a prompt?
[13:41:56] <kurion> Hmm, I suppose not, I do need to get a number, though, from the user
[13:42:13] <djQuery> and it should be <input onclick="function"  not onclick="function()" right?
[13:42:48] <kurion> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp
[13:42:57] <kurion> I think from stackOverflow they used the function(), too
[13:43:01] <RandalSchwartz> nope - that doesn't fix it either
[13:43:01] <kurion> but I cannot be certain
[13:43:04] <RandalSchwartz> it's a scope issue
[13:43:19] <RandalSchwartz> but I can't tell why it doesn't look right
[13:44:48] <djQuery> kurion, do it the jquery way
[13:45:12] <kurion> okay I'll find it
[13:45:13] <djQuery> $('#buttonID').on('click', function(){});
[13:45:29] <kurion> ahhh
[13:46:40] <djQuery> kurion, also look at the way that I generated the divs in mine
[13:47:01] <kurion> I think that way is better
[13:47:54] <djQuery> if you are better with CSS than me you could drop the table completly as well and just use divs
[13:48:36] <Pizza_Guy> I am writing up a chrome extension to help with a game. I am trying to get jquery to pull the value from an input and then do some math and create a div with the information it. However for some reason I am unable to get the jquery to work with any of the inputs on the page. Here is the html of the page http://jsbin.com/wucasejo/1/edit
[13:48:44] <AnTi_MTtr> http://jsfiddle.net/89CzV/8/ im trying to get the actual height and width of an image
[13:48:51] <AnTi_MTtr> is this possible with styles applied?
[13:48:59] <AnTi_MTtr> without relaoding the image into memory
[13:50:02] <djQuery> AnTi_MTtr, if the image isn't part of the doc it doesnt have a height\width
[13:50:17] <AnTi_MTtr> well it is part isnt it
[13:50:20] <AnTi_MTtr> its defined in html
[13:51:33] <kurion> Is it possible that the bug earlier was due to me using single quotation marks inside alert()?
[13:52:00] <kurion> Also, I got it working using the jquery way
[13:52:35] <djQuery> kurion, dunno saw prompt and went and puked
[13:53:20] <kurion> djQuery is there a better alternative, or is the use of it altogether bad?
[13:54:03] <djQuery> kurion, http://jsfiddle.net/z4J85/3/
[13:54:16] <djQuery> kurion, what if they type in A
[13:54:46] <kurion> Hm, I'm not too sure how javascript handles comparing a int to a string..
[13:55:12] <R13ose> Hi
[13:56:26] <djQuery> kurion, still needs some tweeking http://jsfiddle.net/z4J85/6/
[13:57:01] <kurion> That's very well done..
[13:57:33] <kurion> I think I"m going to implement a counter on the top that says what the size is
[13:57:53] <djQuery> kurion, thats fine just throw a label up there
[13:58:43] <djQuery> kurion, you also need to change your div hover to be an on
[13:59:20] <mikechelen> anyone know how in jquery mobile to persist a search form (including input) across jqm pages?
[13:59:21] <kurion> like $('div').on('hover', function(){})?
[13:59:38] <R13ose> I am using this jquery plugin: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel and my id has the css set to width: 7000px; and the body set to overflow-x: hidden but this doesn't scroll to the left.  My code is here: http://pastebin.com/sQzK4wmT  Example site I am basing this off of: http://deanoakley.com/
[14:00:27] <djQuery> kurion, FUCK that wont work i think
[14:00:48] <kurion> djQuery, haha yeah I was trying to figure out how to do handlerIn handlerOut with that
[14:01:35] <djQuery> kurion, I think it is $('table').on('hover', 'div', {enterfunction, exitfunction}
[14:02:07] <djQuery> still searching
[14:02:10] <kurion> oh thats right, I think hover can do that
[14:02:43] <kurion> .hover( handlerInOut )
[14:02:55] <kurion> $( selector ).on( "mouseenter mouseleave", handlerInOut );
[14:03:30] <djQuery> kurion, http://stackoverflow.com/a/18189531
[14:04:17] <kurion> Is using .on over .hover an advantage?
[14:04:41] <djQuery> kurion, or just change to $('table').on('mouseenter', 'div', fun).on('mouseleave', 'div', fun);
[14:04:49] <djQuery> like the 2nd one better myself
[14:05:11] <kurion> hmm, does make it a bit more clear
[14:05:22] <djQuery> kurion, yeah the .hover wont work the way that you are binding to them if you delete them then recreate them
[14:05:37] <kurion> ohh good catch
[14:05:50] <kurion> That's why we're using $('table')?
[14:06:02] <djQuery> yes
[14:06:31] <_u2pop_> hello all
[14:06:35] <_u2pop_> i want to know something
[14:06:36] <djQuery> the .hover, enter, leave is actualy bound to the table and then filtered to what triggered it in jquery
[14:06:47] <_u2pop_> can i include this command
[14:06:49] <_u2pop_> var x = ["Audris Rijo", "Jessica Pereira", "Leila Mejia", "Melissa Guzman", "Aneudy Lara", "Eliecer Marte", "JJ (Grupo Aura)"]; jQuery('.yop-poll-answers li').each(function (i, val) { if (jQuery.inArray(jQuery(val).children('label').text(), x) !== -1) jQuery(val).children('input').attr('checked', 'checked'); });
[14:06:54] <_u2pop_> to erase the cookies too ?
[14:07:01] <djQuery> where are the bots when you need them
[14:07:06] <_u2pop_> the website is http://www.nochedeluz.net/los-cuerpos-hot-2014
[14:07:36] <_u2pop_> for dont ctrl+shift+supr for delete the cookies everytime
[14:08:13] <djQuery> _u2pop_, so if the item is clicked you only want to show pics of the clicked item?
[14:10:42] <_u2pop_> djQuery that command select the 7 names of the POLL
[14:10:52] <_u2pop_> so when i click vote there create a cookies
[14:11:00] <_u2pop_> so i want to delete it automatic
[14:11:34] <djQuery> _u2pop_, why not loop through the array and find the item with the text instead?
[14:12:08] <_u2pop_> because i have to select the 7 names first and i have to write manually the damn catpcha have on there
[14:12:16] <djQuery> _u2pop_, at most the array will only be 7 long correct?
[14:12:19] <_u2pop_> so i have to wait to vote for there create the cookies
[14:13:30] <_u2pop_> yes djQuery
[14:13:41] <_u2pop_> everytime have to be 7 to select for vote
[14:13:48] <_u2pop_> if you select 6 or 8 you cant
[14:13:54] <_u2pop_> have to be exactly 7
[14:15:11] <kurion> http://jsfiddle.net/zera/z4J85/9/
[14:15:13] <kurion> Looks good
[14:16:25] <djQuery> kurion, what are you doing this for anyway?
[14:16:47] <kurion> It's a project on www.theodinproject.com
[14:16:56] <kurion> Specifically: http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery
[14:17:26] <kurion> They don't have the hover functionality, it just sticks for them, but I like the hover effect
[14:19:59] <djQuery> kurion, I challenge you to delete the table
[14:20:08] <kurion> okay
[14:20:30] <djQuery> inline-block
[14:20:51] <kurion> wouldn't $('table').remove() do it?
[14:21:30] <djQuery> kurion, no I mean <div id="gameDiv"></div>   and not use a table anywhere
[14:21:36] <_u2pop_> somebody can help me please?
[14:21:40] <kurion> ohhh okay
[14:21:47] <_u2pop_> how to delete a cookies in the console ?
[14:24:38] <jdo_dk> How do i  trigger this "click": $("#page").on("click","div.objects",function(event) i have tried: $("#page div.objects").trigger("click"); but it does not trigger the "click" event.
[14:25:06] <R13ose> Using this jQuery plugin: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel My id CSS is width: 7000px; and the body is overflow-x: hidden but one section doesn't scroll to the left.  My code is here: http://pastebin.com/sQzK4wmT  Example site basing off of: http://deanoakley.com/
[14:30:43] <djQuery> jdo_dk, can you set up a sample?
[14:31:52] <jdo_dk> djquery: I'm unsure. :D
[14:32:00] <jdo_dk> i have objects loaded by ajax.
[14:32:14] <djQuery> jdo_dk, that would explain it
[14:32:30] <_u2pop_> fuck damn it
[14:32:40] <djQuery> jdo_dk, the click is most likely not bound to them anymore
[14:32:54] <_u2pop_> djQuery thanks for the ignore
[14:33:09] <djQuery> jdo_dk, no you are using on so they should be there
[14:33:58] <duckx0r> I'm having a slight problem with jQueryUI sortable. When I have two lists the "update" function is called on both lists when dragging from one list to another. How can I differentiate between the update that is called when dragging and dropping within the same list and the update that is called on the list when the item is removed when dragging and dropping between lists?
[14:34:21] <djQuery> duckx0r, good one
[14:35:39] <djQuery> duckx0r, sec
[14:35:43] <jdo_dk> duckx0r: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-stop ?
[14:35:51] <jdo_dk> look at the ui param.
[14:37:30] <duckx0r> jdo_dk, isn't that the same as http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-update except that stop gets called whether the position changed or not?
[14:37:40] <djQuery> duckx0r, in partifular the ui.sender
[14:38:40] <djQuery> duckx0r, eitherway you are going to have access to the ui.sender
[14:38:41] <duckx0r> djQuery, except that it is null for the first list's update, so that doesn't help
[14:41:52] <djQuery> duckx0r, then add a custom attr to each item
[14:42:02] <djQuery> check the attr on update
[14:42:48] <djQuery> duckx0r, sender will be null it is the same as where you are dragging it from it appears
[14:42:53] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/takeb/1/edit
[14:43:24] <R13ose> seems no one can help me.
[14:43:48] <_u2pop_> how can include into that command for delete the cookies ?
[14:43:49] <_u2pop_> var x = ["Audris Rijo", "Jessica Pereira", "Leila Mejia", "Melissa Guzman", "Aneudy Lara", "Eliecer Marte", "JJ (Grupo Aura)"]; jQuery('.yop-poll-answers li').each(function (i, val) { if (jQuery.inArray(jQuery(val).children('label').text(), x) !== -1) jQuery(val).children('input').attr('checked', 'checked'); });
[14:45:08] <duckx0r> djQuery, sender is also null when origin list's update function is called too
[14:45:54] <duckx0r> djQuery, here's the order of execution: origin.update, origin.remove, destination.receive, destination.update
[14:46:25] <duckx0r> djQuery, in origin.update, sender is null
[14:46:40] <duckx0r> djQuery, which is exactly the same as just moving something within the same list
[14:48:33] <duckx0r> since remove is called after update, I can't even set a temporary variable
[14:48:34] <djQuery> duckx0r, so if position and sender is null then it was removed
[14:49:02] <duckx0r> djQuery, either removed or the drag and drop was within the same list
[14:49:33] <djQuery> duckx0r, no they will not both be null if moved in same list
[14:49:46] <djQuery> postion would have the new position
[14:49:54] <duckx0r> djQuery, which position are you talking about?
[14:50:02] <djQuery> ui.position
[14:50:07] <duckx0r> ok, let me see
[14:52:22] <duckx0r> djQuery, so basically, use the coordinates to find out if ui.position is within the bounds of the original list?
[14:53:09] <djQuery> duckx0r, sorry exactly what do you need to know?
[14:54:19] <djQuery> R13ose, sorry you are asking something concerning a plugin that I have never used before.
[14:54:19] <duckx0r> djQuery, I want to be able to differentiate between the update function called when moving an element within the same list and the update function called on the origin list when moving from one list to another
[14:54:38] <R13ose> djQuery: okay
[14:54:41] <djQuery> R13ose, could you set up a jsbin or jsfiddle that recreates the issue
[14:55:16] <djQuery> duckx0r, if sender and position is null then item was removed from list
[14:55:38] <djQuery> duckx0r, if position is not null and send is null then item moved around in list
[14:55:40] <R13ose> djQuery: All this is that I am not able to scroll left that is all, and not sure why.
[14:55:53] <duckx0r> djQuery, position is never null
[14:56:06] <djQuery> duckx0r, if both position and sender not null then item moved to list
[14:57:25] <duckx0r> djQuery, position always gets the current position of the helper, even if it's over another list
[14:58:13] <duckx0r> djQuery, so that's why I thought I could use the coordinates of the position to see if they are within the boundaries of the current list or not. Somehow it seems like overkill. There has to be a better way.
[15:00:56] <djQuery> duckx0r, http://jsbin.com/takeb/1/edit
[15:01:03] <djQuery> still working on all the cases
[15:01:24] <jeffreylevesque_> Is the only way to convert server side code to JavaScript is by using emscripten (https://github.com/jeff1evesque/emscripten)?
[15:02:29] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, never heard of it before
[15:02:33] <djQuery> sounds cool
[15:03:16] <duckx0r> djQuery, Thanks. I appreciate it.
[15:03:25] <kurion> is it possible to do $('element').css("height":40*variable)?
[15:03:49] <djQuery> kurion, should be
[15:03:52] <kurion> sweet
[15:04:05] <djQuery> kurion, next time give it a try first
[15:04:25] <kurion> Will do, I really doubted it'd work, but next time i will even if
[15:05:06] <decx> you can also use a function
[15:05:29] <kurion> that's a really flexible parameter
[15:05:42] <djQuery> kurion, but you might need to do   var x = 40*somevar; $('somediv').height(x).width(x);
[15:06:27] <kurion> Doesn't .height() accept no parameters?
[15:06:42] <jeffreylevesque_> djQuery: How proficient are you with jqueey?
[15:06:50] <jeffreylevesque_> *jQuery
[15:06:55] <decx> like this for example kurion http://jsfiddle.net/decx/M24Sx/
[15:06:57] <djQuery> kurion, the parameter is optional
[15:07:03] <duckx0r> djQuery, I think I know how I can do it. I can juse use "start" to set sender element
[15:07:10] <djQuery> kurion, no parameter causes it to return the height
[15:07:25] <djQuery> duckx0r, ++
[15:07:35] <kurion> djQuery, oh, that does make it simpler using just height and width then, I think
[15:07:43] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, pretty good you offering me a job?
[15:08:13] <kurion> decx, ah I see, that's pretty cool how that can be done. Never would've guessed it would be possible
[15:08:26] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, probably not as good as decx
[15:09:40] <kurion> http://jsfiddle.net/zera/z4J85/10/
[15:09:53] <kurion> After much work, the horizontal spaces kind of bother me, though
[15:09:58] <djQuery> kurion, you still havent switched to jsbin
[15:10:45] <djQuery> kurion, instead of changing the outer cantainer size you out to set the outer container to the full width of the page
[15:10:59] <djQuery> kurion, then set the inner divs to a division of that
[15:11:34] <djQuery> kurion, ie the boxes just get smaller
[15:11:47] <kurion> Ohh
[15:11:49] <djQuery> kurion, preven the game board from ever scrolling this way
[15:12:07] <kurion> So kind of make it more and less pixelated
[15:12:11] <kurion> A zoom function, almost
[15:12:46] <djQuery> maybe another slider for the tail as well
[15:13:03] <kurion> tail?
[15:13:23] <djQuery> kurion, for the fade out longer or shorter before it does
[15:13:42] <kurion> Oh, I completely forgot about the hover, good idea
[15:14:18] <decx> what is this?
[15:14:32] <kurion> It's a modified assignment from theodinproject
[15:14:45] <kurion> http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery
[15:16:09] <djQuery> kurion, you are allready covering most of the points there and doing it with a 10th of the code of most of them I looked at on there
[15:16:46] <kurion> That's a bit relieving, putting a lot of effort into it, though. I'm sure some probably rushed through to go to the next task
[15:17:14] <djQuery> kurion, now how to get ride of those dang white lines
[15:17:28] <kurion> Yeah, I think it might be due to the </br> tag
[15:17:49] <djQuery> kurion, shouldn't need the br if you set the width correctly
[15:18:05] <kurion> oh wait no, I dont have the </br> anymore...
[15:18:17] <jeffreylevesque_> djQuery: i am looking for some help with one of my projects https://github.com/jeff1evesque/audio-analyzer
[15:19:08] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, ugh flash I don't know at all
[15:19:54] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, besides flash sounds cool im me
[15:21:17] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/
[15:21:56] <jeffreylevesque_> djQuery: I'd like to replace the flash component with maybe some version of sockets or node.js.  HTML5 has some component that allows the application to use microphone via the browser, but it isn't browser compliant
[15:22:28] <jeffreylevesque_> Ya that's it I think, buy it's not fully compliant with all browsers
[15:22:45] <djQuery> jeffreylevesque_, http://caniuse.com/stream
[15:22:59] <djQuery> half
[15:23:47] <djQuery> safari doesnt thats supprising
[15:23:53] <jParkton> pepperflash
[15:24:00] <jParkton> stay away from flash
[15:24:24] <djQuery> http://addyosmani.com/polyfillthehtml5gaps/getUserMedia.js/demo.html
[15:24:26] <jParkton> look into appear.in
[15:24:32] <jParkton> they do it using html5
[15:24:33] <jeffreylevesque_> My flash component is browser compliant
[15:24:52] <jeffreylevesque_> I'd like to replace it when I can, though
[15:33:34] <jeffreylevesque_> djQuery: whats your email?  Mine is jeff1evesque@yahoo.com, let me know if you'd like to contribute to the public project https://github.com/jeff1evesque/audio-analyzer.  I have to take off for now
[15:38:02] <mikechelen> anyone know how to persist a search form including user input across jquery mobile pages?
[15:39:31] <thinkxl> mikechelen: localStorage?
[15:40:19] <mikechelen> thinkxl: with jqm "pages" its actually the same html file so i could store the values in a js var
[15:40:31] <mikechelen> thinkxl: just hoping there was a better way
[15:41:09] <thinkxl> don't think there is something more simpler/better than using a var
[15:41:28] <thinkxl> it was too obvious that is why I suggested localStorage with a "?"
[15:42:00] <mikechelen> thinkxl: yeah that makes sense, it just means now i have to change the function that runs on form submission
[15:42:45] <thinkxl> yup
[15:43:11] <mikechelen> synchronize input between forms, etc. :D
[15:43:56] <mikechelen> idk if its better to write one function that runs from either form, or 2 diff functions
[15:45:19] <mikechelen> hmm probably 1 function that checks which form got submitted
[15:45:45] <thinkxl> you can do a module that can do that for any form
[15:46:37] <mikechelen> oh interesting, i have not used modules before
[15:46:59] <thinkxl> well, a module could be a function in an external .js file
[15:47:16] <thinkxl> or inside your main.js, is just a way to say it
[15:47:31] <djQuery> mikechelen, just turning the form inputs into a json object is easy
[15:47:50] <thinkxl> var formHandler = function(formId) {};
[15:48:06] <djQuery> then saving that json to localstorage would also be easy just need to have each for have a unique id\name acros the whole app
[15:48:47] <mikechelen> right now i am using:  $("form").on("submit", function (e) {}
[15:49:15] <djQuery> mikechelen, that sounds a good spot to start
[15:49:21] <mikechelen> can i get the form id inside that function using $(this).attr('id') ?
[15:49:36] <djQuery> mikechelen, even easier  this.id
[15:49:56] <mikechelen> oh great
[15:50:35] <djQuery> mikechelen, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1184624/convert-form-data-to-js-object-with-jquery
[15:51:17] <mikechelen> djQuery: why do i need to do that?
[15:51:53] <djQuery> mikechelen, well maybe not that one but just grab all the form inputs and throw them in an json object
[15:52:20] <mikechelen> djQuery: oh i see, well the first challenge is to figure out which form was submitted
[15:52:30] <djQuery> http://api.jquery.com/serializearray/
[15:52:48] <mikechelen> for some reason console.log(this.id); is showing "(an empty string)"
[15:53:03] <djQuery> lol well did it have an id?
[15:53:10] <mikechelen> yup it sure does
[15:53:33] <mikechelen> <input type="search" name="querya" id="querya">
[15:55:15] <djQuery> mikechelen, no that is not the form that is the input inside the form
[15:56:30] <mikechelen> djQuery: oh you are right, thanks
[15:57:15] <djQuery> mikechelen, probably want to make that on change or keyup or something
[15:58:14] <mikechelen> djQuery: hmm why? the query that gets run is kind of slow
[15:58:36] <mikechelen> i can try it, might work ok
[15:58:48] <djQuery> mikechelen, havent used the search input type yet still researching
[15:59:12] <mikechelen> djQuery: hmm whats that?
[15:59:24] <mikechelen> oh the input type
[15:59:50] <mikechelen> yeah i forget what difference it makes
[15:59:59] <djQuery> so basicaly on mobile it basicaly combines input and submit into 1 input field
[16:00:19] <djQuery> BUT on desktop you still need to provide a way to submit
[16:00:50] <mikechelen> ah ok
[16:01:25] <djQuery> mikechelen, http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-input-types/#input-search
[16:01:27] <mikechelen> how does combining input & submit affect mobile?
[16:02:02] <djQuery> mikechelen, instead of an enter or next button you will get a go button on the mobile keyboard
[16:02:14] <djQuery> if the mobile device works correctly
[16:02:24] <mikechelen> djQuery: ah ok, somewhat minor but nice touch
[16:02:54] <djQuery> mikechelen, well imagine that you have more inputs in the same form that appear after the search input
[16:03:26] <djQuery> instead of going to those additional inputs like normal ie having a next button it would go and submit the form
[16:03:39] <mikechelen> oh thats cool
[16:04:12] <djQuery> mikechelen, well that depends what if the next input determined what type of search to do ie image video web
[16:04:35] <djQuery> would never be able to reach than input with the keyboard
[16:05:06] <djQuery> have to escape out of the field then select the additional inputs the manualy submit
[16:06:05] <djQuery> fine if you only have the search field not so fine if you have multiple fields
[16:08:23] <mikechelen> ah interesting
[16:08:57] <znf> Hi.
[16:09:01] <djQuery> back to learning node
[16:09:17] <znf> Could I inject "loading" a script with jQuery with $().ready() ?
[16:09:40] <djQuery> duckx0r, did you get it working?
[16:09:55] <djQuery> kurion, hows it coming along? get rid of those white lines?
[16:09:57] <jParkton> znf: wut?
[16:10:18] <znf> oh dear, .getScript() obviously
[16:10:40] <kurion> djQuery, I gotta admit, I was exhausted; recouping some energy with chess xD
[16:10:45] <djQuery> znf, documentation for the win
[16:10:48] <duckx0r> djQuery, not quite. I think what I'm going to do is compare the number of children from the original list before and after the drag and if it is 1 less, then it was dropped to another list. sounds yucky, but I can't think of another way.
[16:10:50] <jParkton> djQuery: http://screencloud.net/v/p43G
[16:11:06] <jParkton> Im making a mongo connection!
[16:11:08] <djQuery> duckx0r, on drag start?
[16:11:09] <jParkton> thats hawt
[16:11:38] <duckx0r> djQuery, yes. On start, set the number of children, and on update, check to see if it matches (for the same ID)
[16:11:53] <Allen300> Hello
[16:11:59] <duckx0r> djQuery, s/set/determine
[16:12:09] <djQuery> duckx0r, or set the name of the list that it was in
[16:12:20] <duckx0r> djQuery, Yes, I have to do both
[16:12:43] <Allen300> http://pastebin.com/RqRQg70U
[16:13:13] <Allen300> How to get the fadeIn to work as soon as fadeOut is done?
[16:13:21] <Allen300> Cause that code has both going at the same time
[16:13:39] <duckx0r> djQuery, I made a question on SO to see if anyone else has any solutions too (http://stackoverflow.com/q/24718087/811240)
[16:13:57] <djQuery> Allen300, well fadeout accepts a parameter of what to do when it is done
[16:14:04] <jParkton> Allen300: this.fadeIn(3000);
[16:14:23] <jParkton> whatever this should be
[16:15:19] <Allen300> djQuery: the parameter is in function()
[16:15:23] <Allen300> ?
[16:15:27] <djQuery> Allen300, well if #child is a child of #parent fading it in wont do any good if the parent is now hidden
[16:15:56] <Allen300> djQuery: My mind, those IDs are examples
[16:16:07] <djQuery> Allen300, just checking
[16:16:10] <Allen300> I shouldn't have used #child as example
[16:16:36] <djQuery> Allen300, looks like that should work
[16:17:33] <Allen300> djQuery: the code should work?
[16:21:19] <djQuery> Allen300, works here http://jsbin.com/qikiz/1/edit
[16:23:04] <Allen300> djQuery: http://archissance.com/yiisite/yiisite/archissance/index.php/projects/view/1
[16:23:14] <Allen300> It kinda glitches
[16:24:01] <djQuery> Allen300, yeah its does show both of them at the same time for a sec
[16:24:17] <Allen300> what can cause that?
[16:24:48] <djQuery> Allen300, might want to do a setTimout(4, function(){$('#child').fadeIn(3000);});
[16:24:59] <RandalSchwartz> Timout?
[16:25:03] <RandalSchwartz> what's wrong with tim?
[16:25:18] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz, lol
[16:25:29] <djQuery> Allen300, setTimeout
[16:25:41] <RandalSchwartz> "please set tim out" :)
[16:25:53] <djQuery> why does everyone have to recreate the slideshow?
[16:26:07] <RandalSchwartz> it's an idiom!
[16:27:21] <djQuery> Allen300, dang thats a lot of code for a small slide show
[16:27:37] <Allen300> lol
[16:27:42] <Allen300> it's pagination also
[16:28:10] <Allen300> error: ReferenceError: setTimout is not defined
[16:28:19] <Allen300> 0_o
[16:28:27] <djQuery> Allen300, setTimeout
[16:28:46] <Allen300> omg
[16:28:56] <Allen300> i think RandalSchwartz confused me
[16:29:11] <RandalSchwartz> heh
[16:29:14] <djQuery> Allen300, dang irc client has spell checking but not code checking
[16:29:25] * RandalSchwartz holds up bright shiny objects
[16:29:40] * djQuery AHHHHH
[16:47:28] <JimRoberts> Is there a way to search for a string on a webpage and return the full string which it was found?
[16:50:10] <djQuery> JimRoberts, hey hit ctl+f
[16:50:45] <JimRoberts> haha :)
[16:51:18] <JimRoberts> Im using jquery and I can get it to highlight the text and change its color using CSS, but I can't get it stored to a variable
[16:51:38] <djQuery> JimRoberts, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/926580/find-text-string-using-jquery
[16:52:30] <djQuery> other than that its a bunch of substring stuff to replace the found strings with <spans> to highlight the slected items by having the span have some class
[16:52:38] <djQuery> very much a pain in the but
[16:54:09] <djQuery> JimRoberts, but it looks like someone else has allready done the work for you http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html
[16:59:24] <Allen300> i hate this
[16:59:55] <djQuery> Allen300, why not just use anyone one of the 1000s of existing slideshows
[17:00:30] <Allen300> okay but do you know any that allow description?
[17:00:56] <decx> only all of them
[17:01:05] <djQuery> Allen300, http://bxslider.com/examples/image-slideshow-captions
[17:01:46] <djQuery> Allen300, http://bit.ly/VYpC2C
[17:02:12] <Allen300> my search was bad
[17:02:22] <RandalSchwartz> I really like http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/
[17:02:30] <RandalSchwartz> used it for $client
[17:02:33] <Allen300> I did "jquery slideshow description"
[17:03:29] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz, Allen300 anything from malsup is usualy good
[17:04:51] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, this is great stuff
[17:06:54] <djQuery> Allen300, http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/demo/caption2.php
[17:07:36] <djQuery> dang I want to rebuild my machine
[17:07:58] <djQuery> if it wasnt for having to reinsall everything would do it now
[17:08:37] <djQuery> there needs to be a simple comand line util to store all installed apps online and reinstall them
[17:08:55] <djQuery> npm for the os
[17:12:20] <duckx0r> djQuery, It turns out the solution to my problem was relatively simple, in case you wanted to know. When dragging and dropping from one list to another, update is called twice, once for each list, but stop is only called once. So in my update function, I just set a variable called "updated" and in my stop function, check if that's set.
[17:12:52] <djQuery> duckx0r, cool
[17:13:07] <djQuery> duckx0r, get that from stack?
[17:14:11] <duckx0r> djQuery, Indirectly, yeah. The answer someone posted involved two static lists and checking each possible condition between the two, however mine are dynamic, so I adapted it to just use an "is_updated" variable.
[17:14:41] <duckx0r> djQuery, dynamic in the sense that there could be 1 list or there could be 100.
[17:14:44] <djQuery> duckx0r, you can add your own answer to your stack
[17:15:10] <djQuery> duckx0r, all connected?
[17:15:23] <duckx0r> djQuery, I just accepted his answer because it actually answered my question perfectly how I had it worded.
[17:15:27] <duckx0r> djQuery, yes, all connected
[17:16:31] <djQuery> duckx0r, can't believe the amount of points I have gotten from one of my answers
[17:16:43] <duckx0r> djQuery, Oh yeah? Which one?
[17:17:07] <duckx0r> djQuery, this is my record: http://stackoverflow.com/a/17006181/811240
[17:17:18] <djQuery> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/896777/remove-close-button-on-jqueryui-dialog/5301251#5301251
[17:17:54] <duckx0r> awesome
[17:17:58] <djQuery> duckx0r, died of a little since they added my example to the docs
[17:20:29] <duckx0r> djQuery, That's still not even your best answer
[17:21:46] <djQuery> duckx0r, need to answer more and add it to my resume
[17:45:24] <sarkis> hey guys what's the best way to do a ajax request with jquery? i'm having some trouble with $.ajax inside of $('#form').submit(function(e) {
[17:45:35] <sarkis> wondering if that is the best way to do this ^^
[17:50:01] <RandalSchwartz> "trouble"
[17:51:05] * RandalSchwartz starts by suspecting the lack of understanding about "async"
[17:53:21] <RandalSchwartz> sarkis?
[17:54:13] <sarkis> i think i solved the problem, thanks
[18:01:47] <sarkis> the problem i was having is that the form was changing, so i have to instead pick a parent that is not modified and use .on('submit', '#form', function()
[18:02:59] <RandalSchwartz> "form over function"
[18:03:34] <RandalSchwartz> I generally prefer classes to IDs now
[18:03:55] <RandalSchwartz> "everything classed liked THIS should have THAT behavior"
[18:16:20] <djQuery> sarkis, $(document).on('submit'
[18:16:34] <djQuery> sarkis, would catch all forms
[18:16:53] <RandalSchwartz> "pikachu... catch them ALL!"
[18:19:13] <DeltaS4> hi
[18:21:23] <DeltaS4> how do i call a function within itself? or how do I let a .click() within a function finish that function?
[18:22:47] <DeltaS4> http://pastebin.com/WV4L68Ly i have this inside a function but it halts on the alert
[18:23:06] <DeltaS4> or anything else i put there
[18:25:31] <systemfault> DeltaS4: You’re not clear. :/
[18:26:24] <DeltaS4> hmm
[18:26:44] <DeltaS4> so i have a function thats being run on document.ready
[18:27:00] <DeltaS4> and that function works well when its called
[18:27:09] <frank_o> Can anyone tell why I'm getting `Uncaught ReferenceError: myScrollOne is not defined` at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/48/ -- I thought `scroller = new IScroll()` was suppose to define it?
[18:27:19] <DeltaS4> but inside it i have a .click, in the beginning of the function
[18:27:54] <DeltaS4> the click is doing it work by getting the "data-lang" attribute's value
[18:28:11] <DeltaS4> but it stops there and the rest of the function doesnt run
[18:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> ... [Error] ReferenceError: Can't find variable: myScrollOne
[18:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> (anonymous function) (show, line 111)
[18:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> each (jquery-1.11.0.js, line 384)
[18:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> each (jquery-1.11.0.js, line 137)
[18:28:15] <RandalSchwartz> (anonymous function) (show, line 77)
[18:28:26] <JimRoberts> djQuery: Thank you for the links, but Im not trying to highlight, I need to search for a set of words, then get the full item and put it into a variable. As I need to do more with it.
[18:28:42] <RandalSchwartz> wow.  got booted. :)
[18:28:47] <frank_o> you sure did :)
[18:28:52] <DeltaS4> would u prefer to check the whole function?
[18:29:00] <djQuery> RandalSchwartz, dang your back how did I boot you before?
[18:29:02] <systemfault> DeltaS4: If it’s not too long, yes.
[18:29:12] <DeltaS4> its like 50 lines
[18:29:36] <systemfault> frank_o: The message is clear, you don’t have a var myScrollOne written anywhere in your code
[18:29:36] <RandalSchwartz> the error is "Can't find variable: myScrollOne"
[18:29:42] <RandalSchwartz> can't cunt and paste it somewehre.
[18:29:45] <RandalSchwartz> cut
[18:29:49] <RandalSchwartz> Oh geez, sorry
[18:29:54] <RandalSchwartz> just kill me now :)
[18:30:02] <JimRoberts> djQuery: I suspect that contains gets the tag in which it is but I can't find a way to out put it.
[18:30:04] <frank_o> RandalSchwartz: Won't `iScrollStart(myScrollOne);` translate into `myScrollOne = new IScroll(wrapper.get(0)...` which should define it?
[18:30:17] <DeltaS4> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/tQqLz7vT
[18:31:08] <systemfault> DeltaS4: Ok cool, now tell me what it’s doing wrong and what’s the expected behavior.
[18:31:24] <RandalSchwartz> Uh - you can't do that in JS
[18:31:30] <JimRoberts> Here is the html in which I find "my words" <TD align="left"><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">514999 per day</td>
[18:31:31] <frank_o> RandalSchwartz: here's the old less DRY version which doesn't utilize that function: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/xD4y7/45/ .. there myScrollOne gets defined as a global var through `myScrollOne = new IScroll(wrapper.get(0), options);`
[18:31:42] <frank_o> RandalSchwartz: Ah, damnit. Kinda had my hopes up there !
[18:31:47] <DeltaS4> systemfault: it's supposed to run the code after the click and translate the page
[18:31:51] <JimRoberts> I search for "per day" but I need the whole sentence in which is found
[18:31:52] <DeltaS4> but it's stopping there
[18:32:07] <RandalSchwartz> you pass by copy, not reference
[18:32:14] <RandalSchwartz> so foo(bar) cannot alter bar
[18:32:21] <RandalSchwartz> but it can alter bar.xyx
[18:33:32] <DeltaS4> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/xBePKLeb heres the html
[18:33:37] <frank_o> RandalSchwartz: any way around this thing then?
[18:33:50] <djQuery> JimRoberts, I suggest you try to grock the code that I linked to earlier and use it to base you code on
[18:34:13] <djQuery> JimRoberts, also what do you define as a sentence?!.
[18:34:25] <JimRoberts> I know its not a sentence.
[18:34:27] <systemfault> DeltaS4: What code is it supposed to run after the click and translate the page?
[18:34:31] <djQuery> JimRoberts, think of all the characters a sentence can end in
[18:34:56] <JimRoberts> "514999 per day" is what I am after
[18:35:06] <JimRoberts> the trouble is the 514999 can be different
[18:35:09] <DeltaS4> systemfault: everything from line 19
[18:35:14] <JimRoberts> only the " per day" stays the same
[18:35:37] <DeltaS4> with the var languageCode that .click() is getting
[18:35:43] <systemfault> DeltaS4: Then move everything from line 19 to 49 after the alert()
[18:36:33] <systemfault> DeltaS4: I mean, those lines have to be inside the click handler
[18:36:40] <DeltaS4> systemfault: but then it wouldn't work when the page is loaded (with the browser's user language)
[18:36:57] <DeltaS4> is there any way to do both without duplicating code?
[18:37:07] <systemfault> DeltaS4: Sure, it’s called “function”
[18:37:37] <DeltaS4> i could put it on the html but i just want 1 line of code there
[18:37:41] <systemfault> DeltaS4: You create your own “changeLanguage” function and your call it once on load.. and another on click
[18:38:02] <systemfault> DeltaS4: I don’t understand, it’s not like you have the choice.
[18:38:11] <DeltaS4> ah
[18:38:28] <DeltaS4> i get it
[18:38:38] <antlong> i have an accordion, when you gain a level in the game, i use .empty() then call the function that builds the accordion. the data makes it in correctly, but it seems like the style isn't applied until you find another element. is there something i can call to make sure the style is applied when its built?
[18:38:58] <DeltaS4> i didn't think about that
[18:39:04] <DeltaS4> will give it a try
[18:43:17] <DeltaS4> systemfault: thank you! that worked :)
[18:43:35] <systemfault> :)
[18:46:59] <Xgear-> How do you trigger datpicker on ajax loaded content? tried with .on but still no luck :\
[18:48:02] <thinkxl> Xgear-: can you show some code? on how you are doing it
[18:48:17] <Xgear-> Yeah will in a sec, was testing something cos I thought I was being dumb :P
[18:48:58] <thinkxl> cool
[18:50:10] <Xgear-> http://jsfiddle.net/z3AnN/
[18:50:59] <Xgear-> ugh, jqueryui not loaded
[18:51:29] <Xgear-> And now it decides to work on the jsfiddle.. wtf
[18:52:43] <Xgear-> copypasted code from the fiddle doesnt work on my local test site :\
[18:53:07] <JimRoberts_> So far none of these have given me the ability to get the text.
[18:53:11] <thinkxl> is not working for me in jsfiddle
[18:53:25] <Xgear-> I forgot to attach jquery-ui
[18:53:36] <Xgear-> http://jsfiddle.net/z3AnN/1/
[18:53:38] <Xgear-> Works on this one
[18:55:50] <thinkxl> yes, that is cool
[18:58:56] <Xgear-> Lemme do another fiddle, cos I am doing it a bit different
[18:59:05] <kurion> Hi guys, I'm new to jsbin.com; I'm unsure why the same code works here: http://jsfiddle.net/zera/z4J85/11/
[18:59:23] <kurion> but not here: http://jsbin.com/hanih/1/edit
[19:00:15] <kurion> Sorry forgot to update  the jsfiddle: this one is current  http://jsfiddle.net/zera/z4J85/12/
[19:00:40] <RandalSchwartz> No good - ('#main').height()
[19:00:49] <RandalSchwartz> says safari
[19:01:01] <kurion> agh, you're right, that last line I wrote broke it
[19:01:03] <RandalSchwartz> do you EVER even turn on your debugger? :)
[19:01:14] <RandalSchwartz> perhaps... you should.
[19:01:23] <kurion> hmm good idea
[19:01:38] <RandalSchwartz> just sayin'
[19:01:47] <RandalSchwartz> JS console is a useful thing when writing... JS
[19:01:49] <RandalSchwartz> go figure
[19:02:04] <kurion> No you're right, it's just odd
[19:02:13] <kurion> I copy pasted the code from fiddle before and it didn't work
[19:02:25] <kurion> But this time, after removing that last line (.height was the last line I coded) it worked..
[19:02:45] * RandalSchwartz waits for the version without errors before comparing
[19:03:29] <djQuery> hey kurion
[19:03:37] <kurion> hey djQuery
[19:05:28] <Xgear-> Alright, this is a more realistic fiddle with my code http://jsfiddle.net/MKvLq/
[19:05:58] <djQuery> kurion, http://jsbin.com/tamoy/1/edit
[19:06:02] <djQuery> works fine here
[19:06:11] <djQuery> think you didnt copy paste right
[19:06:38] <kurion> You got the hover working too,  I'll double check the code
[19:08:40] <djQuery> kurion, https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/computer-science/allcourses
[19:11:06] <kurion> djQuery, are there any particular courses that you recommend?
[19:11:20] <djQuery> kurion, cs50
[19:11:30] <djQuery> given by harvard
[19:11:46] <kurion> sounds good, I'll give it a shoot
[19:11:53] <djQuery> spend $90 and you even get a course completion cert you could put on your resume
[19:16:16] <Xgear-> I keep getting undefined is not a function on the ajax input when trying to run the datepicker
[19:16:40] <djQuery> ajax datepicker? does not compute
[19:16:51] <Xgear-> http://jsfiddle.net/MKvLq/1/
[19:17:15] <Xgear-> Trying to launch a datepicker on a form ajax loaded into a modal.
[19:17:51] <Xgear-> I placed a datepicker outside the modal to make sure it worked.
[19:19:10] <JimRoberts_> It seems I now have the html of the whole table in which it was found
[19:19:20] <djQuery> Xgear-, not sure why you are getting that it seems to be working once I added jqueryui though
[19:19:20] <djQuery> http://jsfiddle.net/MKvLq/2/
[19:19:23] <JimRoberts_> Now I need to find a way to work on that to get what I am after
[19:20:21] <JimRoberts_> how to I call something thats in an array?
[19:20:46] <JimRoberts_> I know other things its like $array[1]
[19:20:52] <JimRoberts_> does it work like that ith query?
[19:20:54] <JimRoberts_> with*
[19:21:30] <djQuery> Xgear-, you might want to check to see if datepicker has allready been applied to it before you apply it
[19:22:43] <Xgear-> It doesnt seem to work on your fiddle
[19:23:43] <Xgear-> Oh, there is an option to add jqueryui in jsfiddle, never noticed :P
[19:25:14] <djQuery> Xgear-, yeah it can be hidden depending on which version of jquery you select
[19:25:17] <Xgear-> djQuery, just in case though, I am speaking of the input inside the modal, that one is not loading the datepicker
[19:25:24] <djQuery> Xgear-, I have done this myself in the paste
[19:25:48] <djQuery> Xgear-, its working for the one outside of the modal just fine
[19:25:57] <djQuery> dont see why not for the one inside
[19:26:04] <Xgear-> Yes, it is. But the one inside the modal isnt working.
[19:26:13] <Xgear-> Thats my problem really :P
[19:28:08] <djQuery> Xgear-, I see your using boot strap with this. isnt there a date time in bootstrap?
[19:28:54] <Xgear-> Not that I know off really
[19:29:05] <Xgear-> though I want to use jQuery-ui's
[19:30:50] <djQuery> Xgear-, see example 6 http://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/
[19:31:54] <Xgear-> Yeah but its a plugin, would be the same as using jQuery-ui
[19:35:51] <djQuery> Xgear-, I dont even see the input that is in the modal in the html?
[19:36:26] <Xgear-> because the modal is loaded with ajax content
[19:36:47] <Xgear-> the input inside the modal is loaded from a different url

[19:44:49] <iDevelop> How could I make awesome fade in and out, changing the word each time?
[19:45:30] <Xgear-> Yeah it works, though his code doesnt differ much from mine tho...
[19:47:06] <djQuery> iDevelop, it sounds like you need fadein fadeout .text or .html as well as setInterval or setTimeout
[19:47:28] <djQuery> iDevelop, is this supposed to happen on hovering over something or what
[19:47:52] <iDevelop> djQuery, it just happens
[19:47:56] <iDevelop> it's kinda like a slider
[19:48:03] <djQuery> iDevelop, you were probably ignored earlier because you were asking a how do I instead of a I get errors when I
[19:48:10] <iDevelop> You go onto the website, and it loops saying "Our website is ..."
[19:48:35] <iDevelop> I am not sure where to start though
[19:48:40] <iDevelop> so i can't get errors x_x
[19:48:54] <djQuery> iDevelop, are you familar with any of those terms I listed?
[19:49:03] <iDevelop> Yes, somewhat
[19:49:17] <iDevelop> which one would i use
[19:49:22] <iDevelop> settimeout or setinterval
[19:49:39] <djQuery> iDevelop, then go to jsbin.com and put together a simple demo of what you want and see what errors you get
[19:50:05] <iDevelop> djQuery: settimeout or setinterval
[19:50:07] <djQuery> iDevelop, you could use either
[19:50:12] <iDevelop> which would be better?
[19:50:16] <djQuery> iDevelop, neither
[19:50:19] <iDevelop> oh
[19:50:19] <iDevelop> ok
[19:55:07] <DeltaS4> $.i18naliser({ var defaults = { fallbackLang = "en-US" }; }); shouldnt this be enough to change the plugin's defaults?
[20:00:57] <djQuery> iDevelop, thought this would have done it http://jsbin.com/qohav/1/edit
[20:01:34] <djQuery> DeltaS4, different plugins have different ways of seting the defaults
[20:01:43] <djQuery> best to check with their docs
[20:02:23] <DeltaS4>     $.i18naliser = function (el, options) { 		var defaults = { 			languagePath: "language/",
[20:02:45] <DeltaS4> its a plugin im writing
[20:03:10] <djQuery> DeltaS4, have you looked at the widget factory?
[20:04:17] <djQuery> kurion, boy this 1st video seems corny as hell
[20:04:22] <djQuery> frigin muppets
[20:06:11] <djQuery> anyone see why this doesnt work? http://jsbin.com/qohav/1/edit
[20:07:57] <HowardwLo> is there a way to indicate a default value for attr(); ?
[20:08:01] <HowardwLo> a fallback value
[20:11:08] <djQuery> iDevelop, http://jsbin.com/qohav/1/edit
[20:11:52] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: I got it working, sadly its about 10 lines of code
[20:12:09] <djQuery> HowardwLo, just test to see what the value is then set it
[20:12:15] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, link?
[20:12:42] <JimRoberts_> no link, im doing live testing in my chrome exentsion
[20:13:00] <JimRoberts_> I can copy to a pastebin if ya like
[20:13:09] <iDevelop> djQuery: I went there earlier
[20:13:13] <iDevelop> I tried to mess with it
[20:13:16] <iDevelop> No idea :c
[20:13:19] <JimRoberts_> if [name=amt] matches 3 items, how can I define which one I want to use?
[20:13:26] <djQuery> iDevelop, i fixed it
[20:13:30] <djQuery> go there now
[20:13:30] <iDevelop> did you?
[20:13:55] <iDevelop> djQuery: awesome
[20:14:05] <iDevelop> djQuery: do you do css too?
[20:14:11] <djQuery> iDevelop, not so much
[20:14:20] <iDevelop> Are you able to position stuff?
[20:14:31] <djQuery> iDevelop, not so much
[20:14:51] <iDevelop> ok
[20:15:54] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, well did you get the psychic plugin?
[20:16:09] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, which one do you actualy want?
[20:16:19] <djQuery> what kind of element are they
[20:16:20] <JimRoberts_> I will want to use all 3
[20:17:00] <djQuery> $('[name="amt"]').val(50000000000000000000l);
[20:18:07] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, ^^
[20:18:29] <JimRoberts_> Im trying to copy the html into a jsfiddle but it doesn't seem to like it
[20:18:56] <JimRoberts_> There it took it that time
[20:18:57] <JimRoberts_> http://jsfiddle.net/W2hkZ/
[20:20:03] <djQuery> what about the inputs
[20:20:15] <JimRoberts_> the center boxes
[20:20:22] <JimRoberts_> I need to beable to access them..
[20:20:36] <JimRoberts_> on my other page I was working on it was just 1 amt box
[20:20:49] <JimRoberts_> now this one has 3 and I need to beable to find a way to define which one I am working with
[20:21:34] <djQuery> input type="number" min="0" max="9999" step= "1" size="4" maxlength="4" value="1" name="amt">
[20:21:55] <djQuery> also its not valid to have all 3 with the same name
[20:22:10] <JimRoberts_> I know, its not my code, its a game I play
[20:22:23] <JimRoberts_> im writing a plugin for chrome to help figure out cost
[20:22:29] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, oh
[20:23:02] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, you can do .each if you need to manipulate each individualy
[20:23:47] <JimRoberts_> ok, now time to find a .each example I can understand
[20:24:31] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, the docs are the best place to start
[20:25:20] <djQuery> $('[name="amt"]').each(function(i,elm){ $(elm) // this is the particular input that you are looping over});
[20:27:02] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, ^^
[20:28:23] <JimRoberts_> im not 100% on that, but then again its been a long day
[20:33:14] <iDevelop> djQuery: I broke it
[20:33:15] <iDevelop> o.e
[20:33:23] <iDevelop> http://jsbin.com/kajihusa/1/
[20:33:47] <djQuery> iDevelop, congrats you never learn anything if there are no errors
[20:34:02] <iDevelop> guess im not learning anything then
[20:34:05] <iDevelop> there are none
[20:34:05] <iDevelop> xD
[20:35:16] <iDevelop> djQuery: where did thou goof?
[20:35:42] <djQuery> you never set an initial value
[20:35:48] <djQuery> look back at my html
[20:37:13] <djQuery> iDevelop, http://jsbin.com/kajihusa/2/edit hit f12 in your browser then go to the console tab
[20:40:31] <Xgear-> Finally got it to work, no idea how, messed a lot of things lol
[20:42:40] <djQuery> Xgear-, love fixing a prob without understanding why
[20:43:25] <abc_> djQuery: it's me iDevelop
[20:43:30] <abc_> my internet goofed
[20:43:49] <abc_> So, how do I fix the NaN's?
[20:45:40] <iDevelop> ok
[20:45:55] <djQuery> iDevelop, well what is getting the number
[20:46:22] <iDevelop> um
[20:47:09] <iDevelop> if(cur === adjectives.length-1) { cur = 0; }else{ cur++; }
[20:47:15] <iDevelop> djQuery: that
[20:47:20] <djQuery> iDevelop, <span id="adjective" data-index="0">cool</span>
[20:47:24] <iDevelop> OH!
[20:47:27] <iDevelop> I see!
[20:47:50] <iDevelop> It works, djQuery!
[20:49:46] <djQuery> iDevelop, http://learn.jquery.com/
[20:49:53] <djQuery> Xgear-, ^^
[20:50:09] <iDevelop> I have read there quite a bit, but then i go back to php
[20:50:13] <iDevelop> and i forget jquery
[20:51:34] <djQuery> iDevelop, use it or loose it
[20:51:56] <djQuery> iDevelop, trying to learn node mongo and angular myself
[20:52:08] <iDevelop> I got my hands around node
[20:52:10] <iDevelop> php
[20:52:22] <iDevelop> objective c (somewhat), some core c
[20:52:32] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: sadly it still isn't working for me. But I think thats due to how I had to step through for the other one to work
[20:52:45] <djQuery> ?
[20:53:25] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, might want to look at .parent as well
[20:53:59] <djQuery> $('[name="amt"]').each(function(i,elm){ $(elm).closest('tr')   hey got the parent row});
[20:57:35] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, ^^^^
[21:06:35] <JimRoberts_> what does elm standfor?
[21:07:34] <JimRoberts_> im not sure any of this is going to work for me as what I had to do before to get my information..
[21:10:44] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: here is what I did last time to get what I needed
[21:10:44] <JimRoberts_> http://www.ipaste.eu/view?id=7164
[21:11:24] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, wont show it to me
[21:12:34] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: try http://pastie.org/9383267
[21:15:27] <SoItBegins> I'm trying to set up a webpage where— well, there's a very large Flash object on the page. When the user tries to print with Cmd-P, I want to capture that, and instead of letting the print attempt go through, trigger javascript that tells the Flash movie to call the actionscript print method inside itself instead.
[21:15:39] <SoItBegins> Is there a way to capture and, effectively, do a 'preventDefault' of a user print attempt?
[21:17:44] <djQuery> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3834175/jquery-key-code-for-command-key
[21:18:31] <JimRoberts_> did my code disgust you there djQuery?
[21:18:34] <djQuery> SoItBegins, doubt it
[21:18:36] <systemfault> SoItBegins: It might be impossible...
[21:18:40] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, not so much
[21:18:53] <SoItBegins> systemfault / djQuery: I thought you might say that, but I was hoping you wouldn't.
[21:19:24] <djQuery> SoItBegins, how about using the css print to have nothing print
[21:19:32] <SoItBegins> I don't want nothing to print.
[21:19:44] <SoItBegins> I want the page to react as if the user clicked 'Print' inside the flash movie.
[21:19:55] <SoItBegins> So the contents of the flash movie (a map) print instead of the contents of the page.
[21:21:56] <JimRoberts_> anyway to use what you have and make it work like the other one I did?
[21:22:19] <djQuery> SoItBegins, well in the @media print {
[21:22:19] <djQuery>     body { font-size: 10pt }
[21:22:19] <djQuery>   }
[21:22:19] <djQuery> you could have everything else hidden besides the map
[21:22:20] <djQuery> how often does this come up
[21:22:20] <systemfault> SoItBegins: Perhaps it’s possible if you expose a function to show the map from your flash
[21:23:21] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, dang var costtoget = (15000*((newup-1)/3)+(15000*((((newup-1)/3)-1))*((newup-1)/3))/2)-(15000*((currentup)/3)+(15000*((((currentup)/3)-1))*((currentup)/3))/2);
[21:23:28] <SoItBegins> djQuery: You misunderstand; I can't print from the browser; the flash movie will show as a blank. I have to use the flash movie's print function. I can set things up so that function can be triggered from outside the movie, externally, by javascript.
[21:23:50] <JimRoberts_> Ya like that :D
[21:24:07] <SoItBegins> systemfault: Well, that might work, as long as I can figure out how to catch 'browser print' and then trigger the 'show map' function.
[21:24:19] <SoItBegins> systemfault: The map is dynamically generated and can't be rendered into an image.
[21:25:31] <djQuery> SoItBegins, http://tjvantoll.com/2012/06/15/detecting-print-requests-with-javascript/
[21:25:51] <SoItBegins> I found that, and it certainly seems like it'd work.
[21:26:08] <SoItBegins> The problem is that then two print requests would be running:
[21:26:15] <SoItBegins> the 'browser print' one and the 'flash print' one.
[21:26:28] <SoItBegins> So I just need to figure out how to stop the 'browser print' one so that only the 'flash print' one occurs.
[21:26:38] <SoItBegins> … maybe I should take this over to #flash
[21:30:53] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: if we got this thing working I would buy you a beer, or a case lol
[21:31:19] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, you haven't told me an issue yet
[21:31:39] <djQuery> that would be great if they implimented that in irc
[21:31:41] <JimRoberts_> well not sure if you looked over all of my link
[21:31:49] <JimRoberts_> haha
[21:32:15] <JimRoberts_> Basicly I need to beable to access each input box, and get the value listed in teh TD before it so I can figure up the cost
[21:32:43] <JimRoberts_> But I been looking at the game code and there isn't anything I can use to get the direct information I am after to do it
[21:32:56] <JimRoberts_> I don't see a way to do a keyup for each input box
[21:33:29] <djQuery> $('[name="amt"]').each(function(i,elm){ $(elm).closest('td').prev()});
[21:34:26] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, so .closest gets you the inputs parent <td>
[21:35:01] <djQuery> .prev gets you the td that comes before that so you can navigate between the different tds using that
[21:35:03] <JimRoberts_> anyway to put that in a fiddle, sorry my head just isn't wrapping around that
[21:35:47] <JimRoberts_> this isn't a task I should have taken on since I haven't done much coding over the last year or so, and I haven't messed with jquery before
[21:35:53] <JimRoberts_> or hell making an extenstion
[21:38:31] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/vonaf/1/edit
[21:39:31] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, ^^
[21:50:35] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, http://jsbin.com/vonaf/1/edit
[21:53:24] <JimRoberts_> ?
[21:53:59] <JimRoberts_> sorry wife just walked in, she didn't have a good night at work
[21:55:15] <djQuery> well that code set the value of the td before the input
[21:55:45] <djQuery> paste your html in there real quick
[22:08:57] <JimRoberts_> djQuery: updated that link with the HTML for just the table I am working with
[22:09:13] <djQuery> did you save it
[22:09:19] <djQuery> new link?
[22:09:43] <JimRoberts_> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/1/edit
[22:12:13] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, what the heck they have invalid html
[22:12:26] <JimRoberts_> I know
[22:12:26] <djQuery> hidden inputs between tds
[22:12:49] <JimRoberts_> This is a game thats been around since.... 2006
[22:13:03] <JimRoberts_> it was a hack job then and has slowly gotten better when they work on that area
[22:13:11] <JimRoberts_> but some things have been left untouched
[22:18:46] <djQuery> JimRoberts_, http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/3/edit
[22:19:13] <djQuery> table has been around a lot longer than that and having an input in a tr has never been valid since it was creatd
[22:20:22] <JimRoberts_> I know that
[22:20:32] <JimRoberts_> but back then people used tables for fortmatting
[22:21:14] <djQuery> this is tablular data so its "acceptable"
[22:21:49] <JimRoberts_> Thats cool btw..
[22:22:11] <JimRoberts_> still not sure how I use each one for the math functions and creating a div and all that jazz
[22:22:38] <JimRoberts_> I don't see a way to use each one by itself
[22:22:45] <JimRoberts_> I think I need to rethink how to do this
[22:24:46] <djQuery> nope that code gave you the value
[22:24:54] <djQuery> of the text field that is
[22:25:15] <djQuery> now what do you need to do with it?
[22:25:31] <jimroberts> ugh
[22:25:33] <jimroberts> connection
[22:26:13] <djQuery> jimroberts, had to close and reconnect myself
[22:27:27] <jimroberts> Well here is a link to a working copy of what I have already
[22:27:28] <jimroberts> http://jsbin.com/haguhede/1/edit
[22:27:42] <jimroberts> As you can see I really had to work on getting that to do the math and such
[22:28:01] <jimroberts> I dont know how I can use what you did to get what I am after as I need to get the information as needed
[22:28:12] <jimroberts> Yes you gave me a way to get the information, but not a way to pull it as I need it.
[22:28:17] <jimroberts> Wait...
[22:28:44] <jimroberts> nm
[22:28:51] <jimroberts> that idea didn't pan out either
[22:29:08] <djQuery> change line 9 to var requestedup = (($(this).val() * 3) + 1);
[22:30:23] <djQuery> jimroberts, when you do something that is going to potentialy return multiple items like
[22:30:23] <djQuery> $("[name=amt]").keyup(function(){
[22:30:53] <djQuery> inside that function you have access to the one that actualy triggered in the this object
[22:31:14] <jimroberts> on page load however I created the divs I am using
[22:31:37] <jimroberts> I don't have a way to do that, as before I learned the hard way if you do it on keypress you get a LOT of divs created
[22:31:41] <djQuery> infact that could just be changed to this.value
[22:33:11] <jimroberts> Take a look at line 1 on mine, it creates the div
[22:33:20] <jimroberts> how would I do that for all 3 in the new area?
[22:33:40] <jimroberts> I guess if I loop it I just add the loop ID
[22:33:41] <jimroberts> so
[22:34:00] <jimroberts> <div id=MS1></div>
[22:34:03] <jimroberts> <div id=MS2></div>
[22:34:08] <jimroberts> <div id=MS3></div>
[22:34:19] <djQuery> jimroberts, dont use an id
[22:34:36] <djQuery> jimroberts, just use a class
[22:34:54] <jimroberts> whats the difference?
[22:35:12] <djQuery> $(this).siblings('.mydiv').remove();
[22:35:30] <jimroberts> eh?
[22:35:53] <obert> :)
[22:36:18] <djQuery> $('<div>', {'class', 'mydiv'}).text('whatever I want it to say').insertAfter(this);
[22:36:46] <djQuery> and I can always select it in relation to this
[22:37:09] <jimroberts> hmm you just tossed something new at me and Im not sure I follow it
[22:37:13] <djQuery> now it kinda sucks that I am recreating it each time
[22:38:00] <djQuery> jimroberts, $('<div>'); creates a new element
[22:38:31] <djQuery> $('<div>', {property: value, property: value});
[22:38:46] <djQuery> passes some properties for creating the element
[22:39:15] <djQuery> jimroberts,  $('<div>', {'class', 'mydiv'}).text('whatever I want it to say')  adds some text to the div
[22:39:33] <jimroberts> If I am getting what your saying
[22:39:34] <djQuery> $('<div>', {'class', 'mydiv'}).text('whatever I want it to say').insertAfter(this
[22:39:37] <jimroberts> do my keypress
[22:39:49] <djQuery> yes all that inside the key press
[22:40:09] <jimroberts> first thing get the values using the script with the .prev.prev
[22:40:16] <djQuery> yes
[22:40:19] <jimroberts> do the math then create the div at the time
[22:40:35] <jimroberts> but how do I get rid of the div so they don't keep piling up?
[22:40:45] <djQuery> .remove
[22:41:10] <jimroberts> ok. now how do I do the keypress :S
[22:41:10] <djQuery> find the div again then do a .remove()
[22:41:17] <djQuery> ?
[22:41:31] <jimroberts> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/4/edit
[22:41:32] <djQuery> wigh I had a mike
[22:41:44] <jimroberts> That does a loop for all of them
[22:42:27] <jimroberts> How do I do a keypress and it only use that input area?
[22:42:38] <djQuery> jimroberts, right you can use that to then do your calculations and append a div to each row after the input or whatever
[22:43:18] <djQuery> jimroberts, do you understand $(this) in that code
[22:43:43] <jimroberts> Its the elment area that your working
[22:44:35] <jimroberts> ok, I would like to apologize as I have now hit my 19th hour being up so things are starting to blur and not making anymore sense
[22:45:09] <djQuery> jimroberts, http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/6/edit
[22:46:46] <djQuery> dang machine is hanging up on me
[22:47:06] <jimroberts> that seems to be 1 number behind
[22:47:11] <jimroberts> but I think I could work with that.
[22:47:18] <jimroberts> as long as I remeber the rest of it..
[22:48:07] <djQuery> think you want keyup instead of keypress
[22:49:08] <jimroberts_> hmm connection stinks
[22:49:25] <jimroberts_> djQuery: check http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/7/edit
[22:49:30] <jimroberts_> its giving a error
[22:50:04] <djQuery> jimroberts, gotta close some windows and reboot back in 5
[22:50:44] <djQuery> jimroberts, well yeah it is "this" is out of context your not inside your keypress event
[22:50:48] <tandroid> jimroberts_: Don't you want to insert the div after the input on keypress?
[22:50:54] <djQuery> this is not defined
[22:51:10] <tandroid> Also, why not use append() to add that div?
[22:51:13] <djQuery> also you probably want keyup not keydown
[22:52:28] <jimroberts_> I moved it inside the keyup, and changed keypress to keyup but still not making the div
[22:52:35] <jimroberts_> tandroid: have you seen the other link?
[22:52:43] <jimroberts_> http://jsbin.com/haguhede/1/edit
[22:53:00] <jimroberts_> That one works, this one is trouble as all the input boxes have the sam ename
[22:54:59] <tandroid> Oh,
[22:55:27] <tandroid> Why is that a problem?
[22:55:47] <jimroberts_> on the one that works
[22:55:54] <jimroberts_> I create the div I am going to use right off the bat
[22:56:16] <jimroberts_> then using some .text, .splits, and some others I get my starting value.
[22:56:41] <djQuery> jimroberts_, k I'm back got 5 chrome windows closed so I am down to 6 open tabs now
[22:56:44] <jimroberts_> this one has all the inputs with the same name, and do to my calculations I need to know which one I am working with as each is different
[22:57:04] <jimroberts_> Its still giving me an erorr in the console
[22:57:14] <jimroberts_> I changed the keypress to keyup
[22:57:31] <jimroberts_> and moved the create thing inside the keyup
[22:57:38] <djQuery> jimroberts_, do you understand what $('someselector').on('keyup', function(){this});
[22:57:53] <djQuery> do you undestand what THIS is in that context
[22:57:53] <jimroberts_> no i'm sorry i do not
[22:57:59] <tandroid> jimroberts_: Yeah, you don't want to create that div on each keypress.
[22:58:05] <djQuery> this is the actual element that triggered the key up
[22:58:28] <djQuery> so even if the selector returned 100 inputs this is the one that the keyup happened on
[22:59:18] <djQuery> tandroid, wait a sec he needs to understand this first
[22:59:48] <tandroid> djQuery, jimroberts_: what is the for loop doing?
[23:00:28] <djQuery> jimroberts_, in a lotta cases in jquery having to do a loop is allready implied
[23:00:47] <djQuery> you dont have to do a loop at all yourself
[23:01:00] <djQuery> you just have to understand this
[23:02:38] <djQuery> $('input[name="amt"]').parent('tr').append('<td>' + this.value *500 +'</td>')
[23:03:33] <djQuery> would loop through each input with the name amt find the parent tr in relationship with it then add a new td to the row
[23:04:36] <djQuery> tandroid, think I lost him
[23:05:14] <tandroid> Are you explaining loops or "this"
[23:05:17] <tandroid> ?
[23:05:31] <djQuery> see if you can do better
[23:05:45] <tandroid> Well, I just thought we were talking about loops?
[23:05:50] <tandroid> I mean "this"
[23:05:52] <djQuery> http://remysharp.com/2007/04/12/jquerys-this-demystified/
[23:05:55] <tandroid> Ha I don't know
[23:06:47] <sacho_> it helps to know that there's no such thing as "object methods" in javascript.
[23:07:25] <djQuery> this is better http://www.learningjquery.com/2007/08/what-is-this/
[23:07:37] <tandroid> What do you mean by that sacho_?
[23:07:56] <sacho_> I mean that there's no such thing as object methods in javascript
[23:08:04] <tandroid> thanks
[23:08:05] <djQuery> brb
[23:08:22] <sacho_> tandroid, do you know what a method is?
[23:08:27] <tandroid> Yes
[23:08:31] <sacho_> tell me what a method is.
[23:08:31] <antlong> right now to limit actions to 5 per second, i do: if (this.lastRun >= ~~new Date() / 200 | 0)  how do i change this to do 5 per second, plus 1 extra action allowed per second for each level the person has?
[23:08:59] <jimroberts_> djQuery/tandroid Yes I am lost
[23:09:11] <jimroberts_> but I have to end here as I am headed to bed
[23:09:28] <sacho_> antlong, Date.now() returns a time.
[23:09:32] <jimroberts_> I saved your 2 links, I will look them over and be back tomorrow at some time
[23:09:38] <jimroberts_> Thank you djQuery  for all the help so far
[23:09:45] <antlong> >> ~~Date() / 200
[23:09:57] <antlong> << ~~Date() / 200
[23:10:02] <tandroid> sacho_: I would describe it as a function within a context of an object.
[23:10:12] <tandroid> But I could be wrong
[23:10:49] <sacho_> you would have to talk about what a "context of an object is"
[23:11:12] <sacho_> anyway - a method is a function *associated* with an object - it has access to its member variables
[23:11:40] <sacho_> most people assume that doing something like var obj = {}; obj.myfunc = function () {} defines a method
[23:11:40] <antlong> sacho_ Date.now() returns nothing for me
[23:12:17] <antlong> balls, this has never worked apparently lol
[23:12:35] <sacho_> antlong, that's practically impossible.
[23:12:43] <tandroid> http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/
[23:13:12] <antlong> sacho_ i typo'd it works.
[23:13:16] <sacho_> ryan morr invented "context"
[23:13:22] <tandroid> No he didnt
[23:13:26] <sacho_> an object doesn't "own" currently executing code in javascript
[23:13:28] <antlong> so how do i add this logic to allow 1 extra per second per level?
[23:13:41] <antlong> 1 extra action per second* sorry
[23:14:06] <sacho_> antlong, I don't see how that code's related to limiting x actions per second
[23:14:07] <tandroid> Technically, a function is just an object, so I see your point there, but how does that help to understand "this"
[23:14:21] <antlong> sacho_ what? how not
[23:14:25] <sacho_> tandroid, it's simple - this is an implicitly passed parameter to functions
[23:14:45] <sacho_> antlong, where are you specifying the number of actions? where are you checking how many actions you've made?
[23:14:55] <antlong> lastRun is the time of the last action
[23:15:19] <antlong> if (this.lastRun >= ~~new Date.now() / 200 | 0 ) return false;
[23:15:35] <sacho_> tandroid, you decide what `this`'s value is the same way you decide any other parameter - when you call the function*(or when you bind it)
[23:15:53] <qwertyyyyy> randi k pillo
[23:16:10] <antlong> you're probably right though, i wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't work
[23:16:12] <sacho_> e.g. func(param1, param2) -> `this` is the global object, the function's first parameter is param1...etc
[23:16:30] <sacho_> antlong, and where's the number of actions?
[23:16:39] <qwertyyyyy> la
[23:16:43] <antlong> isn't that what / 200 is for?
[23:16:50] <qwertyyyyy> lalalala
[23:16:53] <qwertyyyyy> lala
[23:16:54] <qwertyyyyy> la
[23:17:01] <sacho_> the number of actions is contained in Date.now()?
[23:18:06] <sacho_> are you looking for "5 actions per second" or "1 action per 200 ms"?
[23:18:45] <antlong> well initially 1 per 200 ms fulfilled the requirement of 5 max per second, but now i need 5 per second, plus 1 extra per minute
[23:18:55] <antlong> per level*
[23:19:12] <sacho_> then you need to store how many actions have been performed
[23:19:18] <antlong> ok done
[23:19:27] <sacho_> alternatively, you could allow "1 action per x ms"
[23:19:28] <antlong> do i need to remove the timing crud also?
[23:19:40] <antlong> there would be too much coding involved to do that i  think
[23:19:45] <antlong> the game has no level limit
[23:20:13] <sacho_> it would be an equal amount of coding
[23:20:15] <sacho_> anyway
[23:21:03] <antlong> what would i remove from 200 with each level
[23:21:16] <sacho_> (1 / x)
[23:21:26] <sacho_> err, 1000 / x - where x is your number of actions
[23:22:34] <sacho_> in the first case, you'd store the amount of actions done on the second, and tick every second, wiping that number.
[23:22:57] <antlong> I'm not sure of that working as intended
[23:23:05] <sacho_> I don't know what your intention is.
[23:23:38] <antlong> www.multiverseminer.com click on one of the 3 buttons in the middle, they perform actions
[23:24:12] <antlong> mining, gathering, scavenging. the amount of actions you can perform needs to be scaled to your level. doesn't need to be, but it probably should be.
[23:27:09] * sacho_ shrugs
