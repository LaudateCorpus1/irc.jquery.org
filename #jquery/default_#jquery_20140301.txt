[04:39:06] <sammich_2> hey guys, is there a way to set focus on a non-form element so that keyboard scrolling with the arrow keys will work?
[04:39:52] <HarryPitfall> in html5 you can have "tabindex" for any element (even div), and .focus will work
[04:40:41] <sammich_2> ugh, that's what I'm forgetting
[04:40:49] <sammich_2> cheers, lemme check it out
[04:43:34] <sammich_2> totally does the trick. thanks
[04:54:27] <caribou|> hello
[04:54:29] <george___> Hello there :)
[04:55:30] <george___> Is this the right place to get information on how to contribute to jQuery projects?
[04:56:59] <rodorgas> contribute how?
[04:57:15] <rodorgas> you may be looking for http://contribute.jquery.org/
[04:58:15] <george___> Yeah, I did take a look at the page and took some time to read all the style guides. I also signed the CLA
[04:58:30] <george___> I 'm trying to find a way to get my self involved with the development
[04:58:52] <george___> of jQuery or jQuery mobile
[05:04:44] <rodorgas> things (features, bugs, ideas) are discussed in the forum
[05:04:53] <rodorgas> code is managed at github
[05:06:37] <george___> Ok then, so are pull requests the way to go? Isn't there any coordination that needs to take place between the developers first?
[05:14:25] <rodorgas> i didnt say that
[05:14:34] <rodorgas> join #jquery-dev
[05:15:39] <george___> Ok thanks for the guidance
[06:25:13] <roxlu> hi guys, I've got an absolute positioned div, with all left,right,top,bottom set. When I try to get the widht/height/outerWidth/* they all return 0 why is that
[06:39:57] <overrider> How can i rewrite this easily to make the script continue only if confirmed == true? http://jsfiddle.net/8TRJJ/2/ I am using bootbox to show a dialog, and the code runs trough before the function finish. Thanks
[06:44:32] <zumba_addict> good morning folks, will this workin IE9? http://forums.asp.net/p/1853847/5190753.aspx?Cross+Domain+Request
[06:45:24] <Woet> try it?
[06:46:45] <zumba_addict> ok
[06:47:18] <zumba_addict> i've been troubleshooting a javascript code but no one on #javascript has commented on it yet so I'm trying that link
[07:13:02] <Erryl> I'm trying to show the date using JS, but now I don't see the date showing up, thought the code is correct I think, what could be wrong?
[07:13:13] <Erryl> http://jsfiddle.net/juB8a/
[07:14:08] <decx> i see the date
[07:14:42] <qdk> Erryl: console.log("something in the browsers console")
[07:15:31] <Erryl> qdk: Uncaught ReferenceError: currDate is not defined
[07:20:08] <Erryl> decx: Yeah that's the proble, it works on fiddle but I can't see it on my website
[07:22:33] <Erryl> decx: I copied all of my css html and js code in fiddle, and it still shows up there
[07:24:21] <decx> debug checklist: is jquery loaded, is the script executed after load, do i wear pants
[07:24:39] <decx> yes, yes, no
[07:26:44] <Erryl> decx: I think I found where the problem lays, http://jsfiddle.net/juB8a/1/
[07:27:13] <Erryl> decx: When I remove the code for the widget it works
[07:27:28] <Erryl> decx: So maybe it has to do with the syntax of that? I can't find it
[07:27:35] <decx> TypeError: $(...).menu is not a function because you don'T include jquery ui
[07:30:21] <Erryl> decx: Hmm it works, when I do that, but still not on my site :p
[07:32:31] <decx> debug checklist
[07:35:56] <Erryl> decx: How can I see if the script is executed?
[07:36:04] <Erryl> decx: Btw here you can see it better: http://jsfiddle.net/juB8a/2/
[07:36:16] <Erryl> decx: On my site the loading... doesn't show and neither does the date
[07:36:21] <Erryl> decx: The clock does though
[07:36:45] <decx> look at the sourcecode of the generated page here http://jsfiddle.net/juB8a/2/show/
[07:36:54] <decx> put console.logs everywhere
[07:36:58] <decx> wear pants
[07:43:17] <Erryl> decx: Hmm if I use $('#date').html(day + '/' + month + '/' + year); in my console the date shows up on my website, odd
[07:45:53] <Erryl> decx: So that line isn't getting executed in my JS file somehow
[07:47:19] <Erryl> decx: Got it, I used the ready method on the outside of the date function I made
[07:47:42] <decx> see, debug checklist always wins
[07:47:52] <decx> :>
[07:48:08] <Erryl> decx: Didn't know that was needed :P
[07:48:23] <Erryl> decx: How come if you remove it, the date doesn't show up? Something to do with time?
[07:51:24] <Erryl> decx: Because the clock did show up, and that one doesn't use the ready method. But that is probably because that one is in an interval
[07:52:26] <decx> just put your stuff into a $(function(){ }) wrapper when you want to use jquery selectors
[07:52:53] <decx> and use the console
[07:54:57] <Erryl> decx: I see, thanks for the help!
[07:57:33] <decx> $(function(){ }) = $(document).ready(function(){ }), fires when the dom is ready. $(window).load(function () { }) loads when all the assets have loaded as well (images etc)
[08:01:21] <Velveeta_> window load fires more than once (potentially) too, right?
[08:02:00] <Velveeta_> or maybe I'm thinking of it you add a load listener to images or something
[08:02:09] <decx> ye i think it's only once
[08:02:27] <decx> but could be i only ever use window.load in jsfiddles generated html
[08:03:15] <Velveeta> damnit... irc from my phone is being totally unreliable
[09:30:41] <CarlFK> http://api.jquery.com/mousemove/ "Properties such as .clientX, .offsetX, and .pageX are available, but support for them differs between browsers. Fortunately, jQuery normalizes the .pageX and .pageY properties ..."
[09:31:08] <CarlFK> I need the x,y relative to the image the mouse is over
[09:32:00] <CarlFK> .clientX doesn't seem to be it.  at the edge I get 14.  offsetX is "undefined"
[09:32:36] <CarlFK> how do I find out what is available in FF? (all I really care about for now)
[09:36:29] <decx> get the offset of the element you track mousemove on and substract that from pageX/Y
[09:36:44] <decx> other way around
[09:36:49] <decx> no
[09:36:51] <decx> right way
[09:36:55] <decx> confusing ^^
[09:42:02] <CarlFK> decx: thanks.  I was hoping that wasn't the answer, but i'll stop digging for a nice x,y
[09:50:26] <bradix14> anyone willing to look at a little code for me?  http://jsfiddle.net/bradix14/6sWqF/1/
[09:51:26] <decx> that's php
[09:51:39] <bradix14> I am pretty new to jQuery and I think I'm getting a little lost in passing things back and forth between my jQuery ajax request and my php script.   When I click search the browser just goes to the script url
[09:52:04] <bradix14> yeah, I'm working on the jQuery ajax function, but not sure where it's breaking
[10:09:19] <decx> bradix14 try to console log html in your success function, i looked over it and the js seems fine but i havent done php like this in forever and can't tell if the data you send back is well formed
[10:12:06] <bradix14> decx: thanks. so does the " $("#results").append(html);"  just output whatever the php script returns? or is the append(html) picky on what it's looking for?
[10:12:37] <decx> yeah html in your success function is everything that your php sends back
[10:13:06] <decx> if it's just some html it shouldnt make problems
[10:17:23] <zumba_addict> hey guys, who speaks spanish here
[10:20:36] <rodorgas> portunhol
[10:48:37] <CarlFK> decx: wait... "track mousemove on and substract that from pageX/Y"   what is "that" that I subtract ?
[10:54:48] <bradix14> decx: do you know why my form is sending me to the url of the php script rather than running the script? Is that coming from the form action or the ajax?
[10:55:16] <decx> CarlFK http://jsfiddle.net/decx/fY7Pc/
[10:56:44] <CarlFK> decx: kick ass.  thanks.

[11:29:11] <frank_o> Hello, I'm working on this mobile tap indicator: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/5k2NZ/1/ -- but how come the first link won't follow through once clicked? The second one works fine.

[11:50:45] <w3gi> Hallo... i have a problem here: http://nopaste.info/407c075720.html
[11:50:55] <frank_o> decx: Wow nice!
[11:51:00] <w3gi> if i send the request all animation work...
[11:51:04] <frank_o> I thought I was the only one
[11:51:11] <w3gi> just line seems to have no effect
[11:51:26] <w3gi> line 4 ^^
[11:52:32] <decx> frank_o i dont get why your first link doesnt work either, must be a jquerymobile thing, console.log(event) in the ationfunction shows a path on the targets
[11:53:50] <frank_o> decx: Thanks man
[11:55:59] <w3gi> noone one idea?
[11:56:01] <frank_o> decx: Lemme know if you fork my fiddle into something neat
[11:56:05] <frank_o> decx: I might fork yours as well
[11:57:26] <w3gi> the waitung.gif dont slide down it is just there...
[11:58:28] <w3gi> all other slideUp and slideDown get animated
[12:01:08] <decx> line 1 & line 7 get executed simultaneously
[12:01:48] <decx> put you loading slide into the beforeSend option
[12:01:57] <Erryl> So I have downloaded the zip file for flot on http://www.flotcharts.org/ , but it contains a lot of js files. Which of them do I have to include? The installation page says: Just include the Javascript file after you've included jQuery.
[12:07:27] <w3gi> decx, if i move line 1-5 into beforeSend: then i have the same effect
[12:09:19] <frank_o> Erryl: Not sure, but D3.js is way cooler

[13:22:00] <frank_o> vladikoff: Thanks man

[13:23:43] <lemarc> its is being sent and I am getting the data in backend, just that alert is not working, vladikoff
[13:23:54] <lemarc> vladikoff, anyways, thanks so much for looking into this

[13:31:42] <vladikoff> frank_o, why are you not using jqMobile vmouse?
[13:31:52] <vladikoff> frank_o, oh you are, nvm
[13:32:00] <frank_o> yep
[13:32:46] <vladikoff> frank_o, works for me in Firefox Android

[15:40:37] <Hilton> I have elements which, although visible themselves, are within a hidden div. $('.class:visible') still selects those ones. Is there a way to select only elements which are truly visible?
[15:41:15] <Hilton> I'm trying to improve some major animation lag by only fading in the elements which can be seen, and just using show() on the rest.
[15:42:05] <rue> Hilton: Maybe you want just $('.thingydiv:visible .class') ?
[15:43:39] <shoky> if the div is not visible then neither are its descendants  http://jsfiddle.net/9By9r/
[15:44:38] <Hilton> shoky: You're right. Turns out Bootstrap hides accordions using height: 0 and overflow: hidden.
[15:45:12] <Hilton> I can't use accordion-specific code though, because some elements or some entire pages are not inside accordions.
[15:45:26] <decx> i have just the thing for you http://jsfiddle.net/decx/kyzr7/
[15:46:42] <Hilton> Hmm. I wonder if I'd get better performance using CSS.
[15:47:00] <decx> possible
[15:52:14] <flomei_> Hey!
[15:52:33] <flomei_> I am new to jQuery and it´s kind of confusing but it seems really powerful on the other hand. :-D
[15:53:25] <ankurk_> flomel_: it is
[15:53:55] <phoenixsun> thats to very to the point answer
[15:56:17] <flomei_> What I would like to do is, that an element places itself right beside another element (sidebar on a website). I thought I had something, but it does not work. Maybe you can have a look: http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/hxRPQ/
[15:58:48] <flomei_> i am not sure what doesn´t work. :-D
[16:04:04] <decx> you're not doing anything with your posX,Y values what do you expect to happen?
[16:05:18] <flomei_> assign the top-value to the element q (the aside-element)
[16:05:27] <flomei_> but i think i mixed something up
[16:09:02] <flomei_> oh yeah, i got it. :-D
[16:09:04] <flomei_> http://jsfiddle.net/jfriend00/hxRPQ/
[16:13:15] <Hilton> Huge better performance, but took some major CSS changes (can't animate display:)
[16:23:35] <frank_o> At this mobile tap indicator http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/aPv6Q/8/ -- how do I fix the `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined` inside `showTouchIndicator`?
[16:30:19] <shoky> frank_o:  just use event.pageX  event.pageY ?
[16:32:13] <frank_o> shoky: Hey. Yeah might as well
[16:32:24] <frank_o> Probably don't need all those functions either then
[16:33:24] <frank_o> "The virtual mouse events also normalize how coordinate information is extracted from the event, so in touch based environments, coordinates are available from the pageX, pageY, screenX, screenY, clientX, and clientY properties, directly on the event object."

[16:37:38] <Tomashe> hey guys i was wondering if i got s scipt that start with each. and after that some other things .. the other things will run after the each is done?
[16:38:01] <Tomashe> or if the each is too big it just run the things before the end looping?
[16:38:24] <shoky> Tomashe the each will run and then whatever is after the each
[16:38:29] <shoky> only after the each is done
[16:38:44] <Tomashe> ok
[16:39:01] <frank_o> shoky: Thanks man, no more errors. SVG animation still won't play on mobile though
[16:39:05] <Tomashe> cuz i know when im using ajax .. it isnt waiting for it to be DONE
[16:39:06] <shoky> Tomashe: but if inside the each you are starting asynchronous things like animations or ajax, then they will be finished much later than when the loop is finished
[16:39:16] <Tomashe> yeah ok
[16:39:19] <shoky> because ajax is not done inside the loop
[16:39:32] <shoky> only the request to send an ajax is done inside the loop
[16:39:41] <shoky> the ajax is done when the ajax callback is called
[16:39:47] <shoky> nothing to do with the .each loop
[16:41:12] <Erryl> I'm using this widget: https://jqueryui.com/menu/ , but I don't see the error like the one at Delphi and Salzburg, is there anything I forgot to include?
[16:42:10] <shoky> you don't see what error..?
[16:42:13] <ankurk_> Erryl: were you able to make your links green in the menu?
[16:42:35] <Erryl> ankurk_: Yup that works now
[16:42:44] <Erryl> shoky: Sorry error must be arrow*
[16:43:19] <shoky> oh. maybe you forgot the jquery ui css then
[16:43:54] <Erryl> shoky: Got that one included
[16:44:01] <shoky> then you're doing something bad.
[16:45:18] <Erryl> Well it works, but all I miss is that arrow, so people can't really see you can hover it for the other links
[16:45:58] <shoky> something you are doing is bad and has caused that
[16:46:04] <shoky> what else do you want me to say ;)
[16:46:06] <ankurk_> Erryl: what was wrong?
[16:46:52] <Erryl> ankurk_: I just had to use the a: link thingy, I tried it, but had the wrong selector before, so actually something very simple
[16:47:22] <Erryl> shoky: Hmm yeah probably, or maybe it is the theme, maybe it doesn't have the arrow
[16:47:35] <shoky> it works fine for me.
[16:47:47] <ankurk_> wrong selector happen quite often with me too
[16:47:51] <Tomashe> shoky, i wonder how the on("pageshow" works
[16:48:04] <shoky> Tomashe: huh?
[16:48:08] <Tomashe> it loads once ? or multiple times?
[16:48:24] <shoky> i donno, dont know jqmobile. read the docs
[16:49:03] <shoky> but i'd guess it triggers that event on every page show..
[16:49:20] <Tomashe> https://api.jquerymobile.com/pageshow/ < but i dont understadn if that on EVERY page animation
[16:49:21] <Tomashe> or just onec
[16:49:28] <Tomashe> hmmm
[16:49:35] <Tomashe> ok thats not good for me then damn
[16:50:14] <shoky> it triggers once per page show
[16:50:18] <frank_o> Tomashe: pageshow is deprecated in jquery mobile 1.4, use pagecontainershow instead
[17:05:40] <back2basics> anyone know why lines 3-6 affect line 2 not working? http://jsfiddle.net/3CEPL/6/
[17:06:22] <ankurk_> Well, can anyone help me this issue? http://bit.ly/1fyVmCV
[17:13:09] <shoky> back2basics: you're not escaping your " quotes
[17:16:50] <back2basics> OHHHHhh thank you shoky.  I guess that takes out the whole function as being invalid and not running.

[18:16:28] <jphase> javalover: position: absolute on the parent, position: relative + bottom: 0; on the div you're aligning
[18:22:06] <CarlFK>  <video     id="rawfile6380" ....>  <script> ... hvid = $( "#rawfile6380" )[0];    Why do I seem to need that [0]?
[18:22:54] <jphase> CarlFK: you shouldn't with an id
[18:23:52] <CarlFK> jphase: that's what I thought.  and it only finds one.  but FF webdev thing shows the .0, and sure enough if I leave off the [0] it doesn't work
[18:24:25] <jphase> hm, do you have two elements with that same id on the page?
[18:26:46] <CarlFK> just double checked - nope.
[18:27:06] <CarlFK> I'll push this public in a bit
[18:27:10] <jphase> CarlFK: make a jsfiddle - sounds odd
[18:27:13] <jphase> yeah or that
[18:27:48] <CarlFK> vid.currentTime = imageX;  that doesn't work when the video is paused.  any idea how to work around that?
[18:28:42] <jphase> that's pretty out of context
[18:29:09] <CarlFK> yeah, it is what I am trying to make work better before I make it public
[18:41:54] <mindo> hi guys. is it possible to draw a cell-clickable grid on the image using jquery, or its easier to set image as background image for the div and add <a> tags in that div?
[18:42:56] <jphase> not exactly sure of your exact application, but it sounds like you're describing an image map?
[18:44:41] <jphase> but yeah, if they're just blocks you can set a background image and put anchors on it
[18:45:07] <mindo> jphase: I basically need to have a picture with visible grid on it (1px) and each of those grid 'pixels' should be clicable. I don't want to use image maps as this grid pixel size is configurable
[18:47:11] <jphase> yeah you could set a background image and lay some anchors on top of the element with the background
[18:47:55] <mindo> ok, thanks :)
[18:48:05] <jphase> if you needed an actual image tag you could do it with a container and some z-indexing as well
[18:48:38] <mindo> nah, i just need clickable squares in the region where background suppose to be an image, thats it
[18:49:04] <mindo> it's actually pretty simple thing, but was hoping there is quick solution for this in jquery
[19:02:03] <MartinSebastian7> Hello
[19:06:31] <jphase> hi
[19:13:55] <pom_life> Quick question (PLEASE IGNORE HOW 'BAD' THIS WAY OF DOING THINGS IS): Why do "#left_side" and '#right_side' have such a large height during animation? Try scrolling directly after clicking "Home", "FAQ" or "Contact". ---->http://jsfiddle.net/vXh48/
[19:41:16] <CarlFK> jphase: if you are still around http://veyepar.nextdayvideo.com/main/E/7704/
[19:42:33] <CarlFK> line 290 is the  var vid = $( "#rawfile6380" )[0]; oddness
[19:43:18] <CarlFK> 307 is equally strange: double click an input box to set its value    startbox.dblclick(function() { startbox[0].value = vid.currentTime; });
[19:43:33] <CarlFK> that makes even less sense
[19:44:37] <systemfault> CarlFK: What's wrong?
[19:44:59] <CarlFK> systemfault: it works, but I don't understand why I need the [0]
[19:45:16] <systemfault> It unwraps the jQuery object so you get a "normal" DOM node.
[19:45:26] <systemfault> This is really bad code.
[19:45:52] <systemfault> Using jQuery to retrieve a node by Id... just to unwrap it.
[19:46:35] <CarlFK> I am open to suggestion s
[19:47:01] <systemfault> By unwraping the jQuery object, you cannot call jQuery functions on vid
[19:47:25] <systemfault> CarlFK: It depends on how you use the vid variable.
[19:47:44] <systemfault> You could remove the [0] but it will break somewhere
[19:48:01] <systemfault> Like on line 307 for example...
[19:48:35] <systemfault> Basically, the guy who wrote that code don't really seem to know what he's doing to be honest.
[19:48:58] <CarlFK> lol - that would be me
[19:49:11] <CarlFK> and yeah, I was floundering
[19:50:06] <systemfault> Let's say you remove the [0] at line 290
[19:50:27] <systemfault> Then line 307 must change to  startbox.dblclick(function() { startbox[0].value = vid.prop('currentTime'); });
[19:51:26] <CarlFK> guessing startbox[0].value should be startbox.prop.value ?
[19:52:04] <systemfault> No
[19:52:45] <systemfault> It would be something like startbox.val(vid.prop('currentTime'))
[19:55:06] <systemfault> jQuery is an abstraction on top of the normal "DOM" Api. Right now, you're mixing both
[20:01:31] <CarlFK> how do I call vid.pause() ?
[20:05:20] <shoky> CarlFK: if vid is a jquery object, then vid[0].pause()
[20:05:30] <systemfault> CarlFK: Might as well unwrap it for functions.
[20:05:35] <systemfault> CarlFK: Like shoky said.
[20:12:34] <igcewieling> I know plain javascript doesn
[20:13:06] <igcewieling> I know plain javascript doesn't, but does jQuery have any sort of function for reference counting elements or semaphores or anything like that?
[20:14:39] <shoky> unlikely.. what for
[20:15:30] <igcewieling> shoky: long story.  I rolled my own before I realized most of the world calls what I did "reference counting".  Would rather use a well tested library than my code.
[20:16:43] <shoky> ok, but you'll have to say what this well tested library needs to do
[20:19:36] <toothrot> igcewieling, what's the use case?
[20:20:15] <igcewieling> I'll copy from my discussion on #Javascript.
[20:23:11] <igcewieling> Most of the time form fields have simple dependencies, if the field "have cell phone" is not checked, then don't enable the field where the user inputs their cell number.   Pretty simple stuff.  I want something different.  I want to be able to have multiple fields enable and disable a form field.    I can't do a simple "add attribute disabled" to a list of elements when someone unchecks "have cell phone" because the "I want to be cont
[20:24:04] <igcewieling> My method is the first time a "disable field X' function is called the field is disabled.   Additional times the "disable field X" function is called (from other click handlers, whatever) the reference count is incremented.   The reverse is also true.
[20:24:38] <igcewieling> What I have now *is working*.  I was hoping there was a well tested library to do something similar.
[20:27:43] <shoky> heh "reference counting"
[20:27:58] <shoky> javascript is well tested. x++  and x-- work very well
[20:28:08] <shoky> but i have no idea why you're doing it that way
[20:29:17] <shoky> if you're weary about the nasty if/else logic.. use a data-binding framework like knockout.js or angularjs that lets you set up your inputs (and their state) more declaratively
[20:32:52] <igcewieling> shoky: I've not found any other way.   x++ and x-- is more or less that I'm doing, though I'm adding items to an array and removing items from an array.  My current if/then/else is very simple compared to what I had before using add_watcher/del_watcher
[20:33:12] <pom_life> Yo, shoky.
[20:33:22] <shoky> a library won't help you "reference count", as javascript does counting just fine
[20:33:27] <shoky> hiya pom_life
[20:33:43] <pom_life> shoky: You mind taking a quick look at something for me?
[20:34:03] <shoky> pom_life: nope. but if you could somehow send me a donut in return that would be so awesome
[20:34:22] <shoky> j/k. am hungry
[20:34:37] <pom_life> I can tip you in dogecoin
[20:34:41] <pom_life> and you can buy dogenuts
[20:34:51] <shoky> sounds yummy
[20:35:02] <pom_life> All right: http://www.winningfundraising.net/
[20:35:15] <pom_life> I have a transitional animation thing I whipped up between home, faq and contact.
[20:35:36] <pom_life> An error occurs obviously if you doubleclick a button, because intervals overlap
[20:36:06] <pom_life> What would be the way you'd overcome this? have a variable set to 'false' initially, set it to 'true' while the animation is in progress, then go back to 'false' upon completion?
[20:36:14] <pom_life> and then clicking the button if the var is 'true' does nothing?
[20:37:10] <shoky> eh
[20:37:48] <shoky> if you were just using jquery animations i'd tell you that you prolly just need to stick .stop() or .stop(true) or smth  before animating
[20:38:04] <shoky> but you're doing nasty setInterval stuff with the width too ;s
[20:38:16] <pom_life> well... I kinda just threw a solution together haphazardly. It's "good enough" - i'm on somewhat of a deadline.
[20:38:21] <pom_life> I can make overhauls later
[20:38:31] <pom_life> Would my idea work as a bandage for now, you think?
[20:38:36] <shoky> do you really need that width animation
[20:38:51] <pom_life> You mean the whole closing, reopening thing?
[20:38:52] <shoky> and if you rreally do, why not do it with jquery animation, or css animation
[20:38:55] <shoky> yah
[20:39:20] <pom_life> yeah I do, and I don't know much about jquery animation. that's on my "to look up" list. would this process be a lot easier that way?
[20:39:36] <shoky> probably
[20:39:51] <pom_life> I mean, what exactly is the downfall of doing it this way?
[20:39:53] <shoky> but read about .stop  and .animate (to read about the animation queue)
[20:40:00] <pom_life> If it needs to look smoother, I can adjust the speed
[20:40:24] <shoky> it's hard to deal with as soon as you wanna change something
[20:40:37] <shoky> it's not easily maintainable
[20:40:59] <shoky> and it's probably more buggy than jquery's animations
[20:41:17] <pom_life> Does jQuery animation use an abstracted version of intervals, though?
[20:41:37] <shoky> it uses setTimeout repeatedly
[20:41:48] <shoky> setInterval is bad news in almost all cases
[20:41:58] <shoky> would do you good to forget about it
[20:42:12] <shoky> unless you really need something to happen every x seconds in the background
[20:42:26] <pom_life> what's a common problem you run in with using setIntervals?
[20:43:03] <shoky> that you don't have control over scheduling the next "tick"
[20:43:14] <shoky> it's coming, whether you're done doing what you wanted to do or not
[20:43:33] <pom_life> Why would that be a problem if that tick will happen regardless? (Not trying to be rude, I just learn through questions)
[20:43:39] <shoky> and i donno there are good reasons to avoid it, gooogle it ;p
[20:43:44] <pom_life> Sure, will do.
[20:43:51] <pom_life> Is setTimeout less of a no-no then?
[20:43:55] <shoky> yep
[20:44:23] <shoky> but still i'd recommend trying using jquery .animate or css animations
[20:44:49] <shoky> cause doing all the setTimeout stuff yourself is still more complex
[20:45:23] <shoky> but if you wanna deal with it, go for it. but i'm not gonna debug your code then :P
[20:46:01] <pom_life> The differences seem subtle between the two, looking @ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/729921/settimeout-or-setinterval
[20:46:23] <pom_life> I can see that setTimeout performs a function after a set period of time, and setInterval performs a function every x ms
[20:46:24] <shoky> setTimeout just sets a one-time timer
[20:46:31] <shoky> setInterval sets an infinite amount.
[20:46:37] <shoky> not so subtle
[20:46:43] <pom_life> so why would animate be a series of timeouts instead of an interval?
[20:46:57] <pom_life> more control, less fluidity, noi?
[20:47:09] <shoky> more control, same fluidity
[20:47:16] <shoky> if you do your calculations right
[20:47:25] <shoky> and set the next timeout right
[20:47:33] <igcewieling> pom_life: It is easier to cancel a setInterval than it is to keep track of setTimeouts
[20:47:33] <pom_life> plus I guess with an interval every 'movement' in an animation would have to be the same
[20:47:55] <pom_life> igcewieling: Exactly, which is why I opted to use it on http://www.winningfundraising.net/
[20:48:01] <shoky> for animations, really what's recommended
[20:48:01] <pom_life> was just told it's bad practice though
[20:48:04] <shoky> is css animations
[20:48:09] <shoky> or requestAnimationFrame
[20:48:12] <pom_life> regardless, I'm looking into css animations
[20:48:12] <shoky> instead of setTimeout
[20:48:21] <pom_life> requestAnimationFrame is a whole other beast lol
[20:48:32] <shoky> i think there's a jquery branch that uses rAF
[20:48:55] <igcewieling> heh, your shadows and border radious is almost exactly the same as what I use
[20:49:03] <pom_life> mine?
[20:49:09] <igcewieling> yeah
[20:49:19] <pom_life> They seem noticeable but not overly obvious with those values, imo.
[20:49:32] <pom_life> just enough to add a little something to the page
[20:50:11] <pom_life> shoky: What's your favorite IDE?
[20:50:26] <igcewieling> pom_life: exactly the same reasons I choose that style
[20:50:54] <shoky> pom_life: i usually don't use a full IDE for webdev stuff, but my fav is WebStorm
[20:50:55] <pom_life> igcewieling: If you don't mind: How long have you done webdev / do you do it for a living / what methods did you use to learn at first?
[20:51:14] <pom_life> What would you call Sublime Text 3... it's not a full blown IDE... just a code editor?
[20:51:18] <igcewieling> pom_life: I hate web dev and only do it as a last resort so I'm not a good person to ask.
[20:51:34] <pom_life> igcewieling: Interesting. What brings you 'round here, then?
[20:51:40] <igcewieling> jQuery is the only thing which makes Javascript usable.
[20:51:46] <shoky> pom_life: yeah.. i actually just started using sublime like a week ago
[20:51:52] <igcewieling> pom_life: I'm on my last resort. 8-|
[20:52:41] <pom_life> shoky: I love the command palette in ST3. Not to mention the color scheme.
[20:52:51] <shoky> i don't like the command palette
[20:52:53] <pom_life> igcewieling: Are you a backend dev then?
[20:53:01] <shoky> fucken page-up and page-down do nothing, come on..
[20:53:08] <igcewieling> pom_life: PBX and system admin usually.
[20:53:09] <shoky> it's shitty to navigate it
[20:53:25] <shoky> and then there are the plugins that use that same shitty palette interface
[20:53:31] <shoky> so they are hard to navigate too
[20:53:41] <pom_life> dayum
[20:53:47] <pom_life> haven't heard this much hate since dreamweaver :D
[20:54:03] <shoky> no hate really, that's the only thing that annoys me about it  ;p
[20:54:06] <pom_life> igcewieling: Ah. You just delve into code occasionally, then? :]
[20:54:09] <shoky> i like it mostly
[20:54:14] <pom_life> i think it's beautiful
[20:54:23] <shoky> but i expected more
[20:54:30] <pom_life> what's your favorite feature in webstorm?
[20:54:34] <igcewieling> The "web app" is a pbx switch management system.   Unfortuantly the project is 50x more work than I thought it would be.
[20:54:56] <shoky> not webstorm particularly, but JetBrains editors in general, are just great
[20:55:13] <pom_life> igcewieling: Can you define PBX? Google tells me it's "private branch exchange"
[20:55:20] <shoky> everything does what you want, and fast, and there are tons of useful shit in there
[20:55:37] <igcewieling> pom_life: I'm more of a telecom guy, but have been doing small amounts of programming since 1985 I think.
[20:55:46] <igcewieling> pom_life: "company phone system"
[20:55:49] <shoky> and the intellisense is the best
[20:56:13] <shoky> though of course for javascript it's not perfect, as that'd be impossible
[20:56:25] <igcewieling> i.e. I work for a telephone company
[20:56:40] <pom_life> igcewieling: I see. Been doing it for awhile?
[20:57:02] <pom_life> igcewieling: Oh I saw your earlier post.. 1985 huh? I was -7!
[20:57:16] <shoky> ouch
[20:57:43] <shoky> you're 12?
[20:57:58] <shoky> er
[20:57:58] <pom_life> yeah, 12, if you flip the integers xD
[20:58:05] <shoky> fuck i'm too old for this
[20:58:21] <igcewieling> pom_life: I've been doing heavy telecom for about 5 years or so, WAN/LAN and linux management for about 10 years before that
[20:58:31] <igcewieling> shoky: me too.
[20:58:36] <pom_life> shoky: if (!boolean) {};  means "if boolean is false", correct?
[20:59:07] <shoky> pom_life: yes, more specifically tho it means  "if boolean is falsy"
[20:59:18] <shoky> well if it's a boolean then false, yes
[20:59:22] <pom_life> igcewieling: Personal question, but useful for someone considering various careers: Do you have an estimate of annual income in that position? Please don't feel obliged to answer.
[21:00:57] <igcewieling> the company I work for does not pay all that well.  I get to work from home and have a flexible schedule, but that is not the norm.  I also get to spend large amounts of time going "interesting stuff which may or may not someday help the company with something"   I make enough to be happy with, though I don't have a lot of expenses.
[21:02:11] <shoky> hah sounds like me
[21:02:15] <pom_life> igcewieling: Thanks, man. Right now I've struck something that could be lucrative with a local sales company. I've secured 10% of net profits from any client acquisitions for webmastering and social media management. It's a local start-up with a decent backing.
[21:02:17] <s5fs> i don't know many telecom folks, you all are normally hidden behind many doors
[21:03:01] <igcewieling> s5fs: That is the best for everyone involved.
[21:03:04] <_genuser_> so multiple places needing a confirmation dialog. Do you setup a different one for each "type" of interaction needing a confirmation?
[21:03:21] <igcewieling> Some of our recently hired customer service people are not afraid of me, that needs to change.
[21:03:23] <_genuser_> or do you guys setup one confirm dialog and use it for different purposes.
[21:03:50] <pom_life> igcewieling: Do you work for a major, recognizable telecom? Or is it a smaller deal?
[21:06:01] <igcewieling> pom_life: Small regional phone company -- Standard telecom (POTS, T-1, EoC etc) and SIP with analog or PRI handoff to the customer.   We have a few plain SIP clients, but that is unusual.   our wholesalers have a national footprint, but we only have people in the NY/NJ/PA areas.
[21:06:21] <pom_life> I... I think I've been acronymed to death.
[21:06:38] <igcewieling> about half our call volume is traditional telecom, about half is VoIP
[21:06:56] <igcewieling> I deal with the VoIP side.
[21:07:21] <pom_life> Allow me to retaliate: Recently my IDE wasn't good enough (and I didn't need the WYSIWYG) so I now use ST3 to edit HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Python & more.
[21:07:35] <_genuser_> anybody have any ideas on confirmation dialogs?
[21:07:48] <pom_life> What about them specifically?
[21:08:04] <igcewieling> ST3 is the only one which I don't know.
[21:08:10] <_genuser_> do you setup just one and reuse for different purposes?
[21:08:21] <_genuser_> or do you set one up for each type of interaction.
[21:08:41] <igcewieling> _genuser_: I do both.  For generic popups I use a single dialog, for more complicated ones I use custom dialogs
[21:08:45] <_genuser_> because when you define the .dialog, you provide the code for the OK button. And I don't see how that can be changed later.
[21:09:18] <_genuser_> igcewieling: I have "rigs" and "profiles". I have one working for "profiles". but when I defined the dialogs, I put code in teh ok button to delete the profiles.
[21:09:36] <pom_life> How many "types" of dialogs would you have exactly?
[21:09:37] <pom_life> A lot?
[21:09:40] <_genuser_> igcewieling: now to reuse the same one for "rigs", I'd have to determine inside the ok button code which is being deleted.
[21:09:43] <_genuser_> just the two.
[21:10:16] <pom_life> why not just edit the code for 'rigs' when "OK" is pressed?
[21:10:23] <pom_life> Is it similar, but slightly different code?
[21:11:13] <_genuser_> instead of $.post("index.php", {cmd: "deleteprofiles", dbid: $dbid} ir would be "deleterigs"
[21:11:40] <_genuser_> dbid parts stays teh same. just the post cmd to index.php changes.
[21:12:15] <pom_life> yeah, I don't understand why you wouldn't just use two separate confirmation types in that situation, though I'm probably misunderstanding something
[21:13:36] <_genuser_> pom_life: I'm able to chagne the verbiage on teh dialog at run time. so I thought maybe I could detect the "type" of confirmation it is at runtime also.
[21:13:55] <_genuser_> pom_life: but also I've noticed that sometimes by asking I find out a nicer alternative to what I was going to do.
[21:14:11] <_genuser_> with each new framework there comes a new way to handle some stuff sometimes.
[21:14:14] <pom_life> _genuser_ I completely agree with you there; that's how I learn myself.
[21:14:28] <_genuser_> so I was about to add a second dialog, when I thought maybe there's a better way. :)
[21:14:47] <pom_life> Well... what about using an object with properties?
[21:15:04] <_genuser_> JS object? and pass it around? or a global js object?
[21:15:18] <pom_life> like here's what i was thinking
[21:15:27] <pom_life> at first I thought of using a switch
[21:15:41] <pom_life> and clicking ok activates a switch which executes code depending on the tpye of confirmation
[21:15:59] <pom_life> but switches are best avoided in place of using object-like notation
[21:16:56] <pom_life> you could have the confirmation as a global object and set "Type" : deleterigs   or "Type": deleteprofiles
[21:17:09] <pom_life> and have a method for the object that acts differently depending on the type
[21:17:23] <_genuser_> so property on $("dialog-confirm") object.
[21:17:54] <_genuser_> $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog({ } );    I can add properties to this? custom attributes/properties?
[21:17:55] <pom_life> maybe $("dialog-confirm").type = deleterigs || deleteprofiles
[21:18:08] <pom_life> well that would be doing it directly
[21:18:16] <pom_life> i was thinking make a separate object
[21:18:29] <pom_life> that when initialized prompts a ... prompt
[21:18:32] <pom_life> as a method
[21:18:40] <pom_life> and then depending on type executes different code
[21:18:55] <pom_life> ill mockup something real quick, hold on
[21:19:06] <_genuser_> I see. a JS ask_confirmation object. That then sets up the .type, and launches the dialog. And the ok button queries the .type and runs the correct code.
[21:19:48] <_genuser_> I like that. I kinda like crap stuff into an object. it's the coding equivalent of sweeping stuff under teh rug before guests arrive.
[21:20:02] <pom_life> well
[21:20:07] <pom_life> it's better for organization
[21:20:13] <pom_life> and reusability
[21:20:16] <pom_life> and modulization
[21:20:17] <pom_life> etc
[21:20:58] <_genuser_> and re-use in future projects. set once and literally forget it. especially forget how to code it, lol.
[21:27:56] <pom_life> _genuser_: http://jsfiddle.net/UQU6u/1/
[21:29:07] <systemfault> Wow... just read his name as porn_life :/ I must be tired.
[21:29:42] <pom_life> systemfault: You're far from the first. Also, you've talked to me numerous times before D:
[21:29:55] <systemfault> I know, that's the weird thing.
[21:30:24] <_genuser_> let's see what you whipped up.
[21:31:39] <pom_life> _genuser_: I'd add a method for each possible thing you'd want the prompt to do, and then on activate have a switch that detects type and executes a different method depending on type.
[21:31:49] <_genuser_> pom_life: I see. I was thinking a jquery confirm dialog. not a js one.
[21:32:10] <_genuser_> pom_life: I misused the term confirmation dialog. I should just say dialog. since those can be used with any number of buttons.
[21:32:10] <pom_life> it'd be the same idea
[21:32:55] <pom_life> basically you'd abstract an object, have the dialog box itself execute code depending on the type of the object
[21:34:23] <systemfault> _genuser_: It will be a bit more difficult with a jquery confirm dialog
[21:34:50] <systemfault> _genuser_: Because you're going from a sync to an async function
[21:35:17] <systemfault> But.. like pom_life said, it's the same idea
[21:35:34] <_genuser_> yeah, I'm thinking if I can add a property to the dialog box itself.
[21:35:38] <_genuser_> as an attribute.
[21:35:46] <_genuser_> or property etc.
[21:39:40] <pom_life> systemfault: Say I have an img tag inside of a div. The src property of the image determines which image is loaded. To change an image tags source, would I use $('#imageINeedToChange').prop('src','(source)');
[21:42:38] <_genuser_> pom_life: http://jsfiddle.net/G5PYV/
[21:43:14] <_genuser_> something like that. but do you see the .attr('typeconfirm')  <-- somethign like that if I could set it on the dialog. So then I could query it inside the OK button click which gets defined inside the dialog itself.
[21:44:00] <_genuser_> updated one.  http://jsfiddle.net/G5PYV/1/
[21:46:51] <pom_life> _genuser_: Sorry, I don't seem to be looking at this from the correct point of view. I see you're creating #dialog-confirm as an object literal
[21:47:45] <_genuser_> pom_life: very new to jquery. still get confused by syntax and concepts. :)
[21:48:04] <_genuser_> pom_life: ok, so I see that I've create a <div> for dialog representation.
[21:48:30] <_genuser_> pom_life: then I've used jquery functions and used .dialog() to turn this div into a dialog and provided number of buttons and a click handler for each button.
[21:49:08] <_genuser_> pom_life: my understanding is that "THAT" is all that dialog box will do. because it's defined to have 2 buttons. and the "Delete" button will only do what's defined for it.
[21:49:56] <_genuser_> pom_life: my understanding is that this line creates teh dialog: $( "#dialog-confirm" ).dialog({xxx });
[21:50:07] <_genuser_> uhoh I said xxx, now systemfault will think porn ...
[21:50:25] <systemfault> No, it's okay :D
[21:50:33] <_genuser_> pom_life: so do I understand this correctly so far?
[21:50:54] <pom_life> Okay. I'm not quite as knowledgable when it comes to jQuery dialogs. This might be a better question for someone more experienced.
[21:50:57] <_genuser_> systemfault: :p
[21:51:26] <_genuser_> pom_life: so I was incorporating your idea of passing it a "work type".
[21:51:43] <pom_life> Why do you need to manipulate it during runtime? Let's start there
[21:51:44] <_genuser_> so I thought I could add custom attributes to it. and in the Delete button click check that.
[21:51:54] <b0t> Hi, any expert could analyze me a code jquery? I do not
[21:52:14] <_genuser_> pom_life: oh, that's a question that goes to using the "same" dialog for multiple types of deletes.
[21:52:29] <_genuser_> pom_life: delete rigs? (use same dialog). delete profiles? (use same dialog).
[21:52:49] <_genuser_> pom_life: saves me the hassle of all those lines of jquery being duplicated. I change one dialog, I have to change the other.
[21:53:18] <pom_life> so you just need to define each 'page' (for lack of a better term) to have a property called type, and then have the dialog box analyze the type of 'page' and react accordingly, i'd imagine.
[21:53:34] <pom_life> so it 'knows' if you mean delete rigs or delete profiles
[21:53:44] <pom_life> based on when the confirmation box pops up
[21:53:50] <_genuser_> page equals <div>?
[21:54:10] <pom_life> if you're using divisions, yeah
[21:54:17] <_genuser_> so use the same "dilaog" but pass it a different <div>. Ooooh, I like that.
[21:54:19] <b0t> Hi, any expert could analyze me a code jquery? I do not
[21:54:30] <_genuser_> in the div, I could setup, data-confirm-type...
[21:54:36] <_genuser_> just like I have data-profile-id, etc.
[21:54:50] <pom_life> yeah.... if you are using classes (like you should) you could use an id for the "type"... then switch on the id and execute code depending on the result
[21:55:04] <_genuser_> nice! thanks. :)
[21:55:11] <pom_life> happy to be your rubber duck
[21:55:17] <_genuser_> off to implement this concoction.
[21:55:22] <_genuser_> lol rubber duck.
[21:55:22] <_genuser_> :)
