[00:00:30] <Bioblaze> $('a').click(function() {
[00:00:31] <Bioblaze> 		alert('ok test');
[00:00:31] <Bioblaze> 	});
[00:00:42] <Bioblaze> I changed it too that, but it doesnt seem to trigger a alert :(
[00:00:47] <Cork> use the handler i gave you
[00:01:06] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { alert('click'); });
[00:01:41] <Bioblaze> Nothing.
[00:01:47] <DaVinciIT> morning all. JQueryUI. Modal Dialog reAttached to main form does not work well. http://pastebin.com/9u0AnN67
[00:01:54] <Cork> Bioblaze: is the js file loading?
[00:01:57] <DaVinciIT> the div is not 'enabled'
[00:02:03] <DaVinciIT> can you help me? thank you.
[00:02:28] <Bioblaze> I dont understand.
[00:02:31] <Bioblaze> XD
[00:03:08] <DaVinciIT> Modal Dialog is all 'disabled'. I've to press ESC to exit modal state.
[00:03:16] <DaVinciIT> try the code pasted. :)
[00:03:17] <Cork> DaVinciIT: the jQuery() part in the appendTo isn't needed (it shouldn't break it either though)
[00:03:42] <Cork> Bioblaze: do you have a link to the page where you load the custome.js file?
[00:04:14] <DaVinciIT> Cork: thank you for your reply. Unlukly I need it cause I use it in Asp.Net page. I need it stay inner a Form to work properly (submit buttons).
[00:04:37] <Bioblaze> http://wolfpack-manor.net/~NCS/js/Custom.js
[00:04:39] <Cork> DaVinciIT: you missed my point
[00:04:49] <Cork> DaVinciIT: dlg.parent().appendTo(jQuery("form:first")); === dlg.parent().appendTo("form:first");
[00:05:03] <Cork> it's just code simplification, so it isn't an answer
[00:05:12] <DaVinciIT> ... ops I try thank you.
[00:05:53] <DaVinciIT> Cork: ok thankyou for simplification. does not work.
[00:06:16] <Cork> DaVinciIT: it does, but the problem is something else
[00:06:36] <Cork> DaVinciIT: try dlg.dialog('widget').appendTo('form:first')
[00:07:25] <DaVinciIT> widget ?
[00:07:51] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-widget
[00:09:07] <DaVinciIT> Cork: thank you bu nothing to do. can you try my html page yourself ?
[00:09:15] <Cork> sure
[00:09:25] <Cork> Bioblaze: i need the page loading the js file, not just the js file
[00:09:42] <Bioblaze> wolfpack-manor.net/~NCS/
[00:09:50] <Bioblaze> Doing a test right now Changing something
[00:10:10] <Cork> Bioblaze: [09:09:56.182] ReferenceError: $ is not defined @ http://wolfpack-manor.net/~NCS/js/Custom.js:1
[00:10:39] <jnewt> i'm trying to get the value of a textbox with var tb_text = this.val();  i can see the value is "1" in my ff debugger, but tb_text is undefined.
[00:10:53] <Cork> Bioblaze: move your jquery script up to before the custom file
[00:11:32] <Bioblaze> ok where do you find that error @?
[00:11:35] <Bioblaze> Is it a plugin?
[00:11:35] <Bioblaze> XD
[00:11:44] <Cork> Bioblaze: the browsers error console
[00:11:49] <Cork> jnewt: are you setting it in the same scope?
[00:11:58] <Cork> Bioblaze: what browser are you using?
[00:12:11] <Bioblaze> firefox
[00:12:19] <Cork> ctrl+shift+k
[00:13:04] <jnewt> Cork: I'm not sure what you mean, I'm pretty new to this, but i know that i can inspect "this" and see all the info on the textbox if i breakpoint in my function.
[00:13:18] <jnewt> that includes the value.
[00:13:59] <Cork> jnewt: ex. $(function() { var bt_text = '1'; }); bt_text == undefined
[00:14:29] <Cork> jnewt: if you're not sure, pb the code in question
[00:15:29] <jnewt> Cork: http://pastebin.com/QbUimnAg
[00:17:34] <Cork> jnewt: 1. $(this), not $("this"); 2. child.prop('id'), not child.id
[00:17:39] <Bioblaze> thx for that console XD lolz.
[00:18:47] <Bioblaze> Ok so the File is Loading, and It is Detecting the Click on the a within #navi.
[00:18:47] <Cork> jnewt: 3. $(this).val(), not this.val()
[00:19:30] <Bioblaze> Now the only Problem is, I need to remove .disabled from all anchors within the #navi id, and then Add .disabled to the "Clicked" Anchor.
[00:20:13] <Cork> $('#navi a').removeClass('disabled');$(this).addClass('disabled')
[00:20:40] <jnewt> Cork: thanks, now i have the text.  qq, why does var id =this.id.split('_'); work, but i need child.prop('id') ?
[00:21:02] <Cork> jnewt: cause child is a jquery object
[00:21:07] <Cork> it doesn't have an id member
[00:21:18] <Cork> s/member/property/
[00:21:52] <Bioblaze> *Hugs Cork* ^_^ Your Awesome
[00:21:53] <Bioblaze> LoLz
[00:21:54] <Cork> jnewt: its the same reason you need to use $(this).val() instead of this.val() (but the other way around)
[00:22:19] <Cork> Bioblaze: np
[00:22:54] <Cork> jnewt: this is a pure dom object pointed to by the variable "this"
[00:23:38] <Cork> jnewt: while child is a variable pointing to a jquery object, that contains an array of dom elements (length 1)
[00:24:07] <Cork> jnewt: so child.prop('id') is basically the same as child[0].id
[00:24:44] <Cork> jnewt: hope that clears things up
[00:46:49] <horsik> shit
[00:47:09] <horsik> what the fuck is wrong with this value
[00:47:12] <horsik> -(Math.pow(Math.pow(-8, 2), 1/3) / 4) + 1
[00:49:24] <Cork> horsik: would help if you explained what you expect out
[00:51:04] <horsik> Cork: when I check if it's lesser than 100 gives me false
[00:51:16] <horsik> console says its 1.1102230246251565e-16
[00:51:50] <Cork> --
[00:51:50] <Cork> [09:51:38.861] (-(Math.pow(Math.pow(-8, 2), 1/3) / 4) + 1) < 100
[00:51:50] <Cork> [09:51:38.885] true
[00:52:33] <horsik> nope
[00:52:43] <Cork> though i would prob rewrite it as 1 - (Math.pow(Math.pow(-8, 2), 1/3) / 4)

[02:24:10] <kelye> hello, anyone knows if there are legal issues with partially saving a form with ajax ?
[02:24:22] <kelye> I mean during completion, on blur
[02:41:35] <Cork> kelye: that would depend on what the form contains
[02:41:57] <kelye> name, email, address :)
[02:42:05] <kelye> no card details or such
[02:48:27] <ussher_> Looking for a way to use jquery to dynamically add table rows and columns, but can only locate the add rows examples:  http://www.xinotes.org/notes/note/1063/    Wanting to create a form to input the data that gets turned into a table on output.
[02:50:48] <trailethuy> kkdk
[02:51:04] <trailethuy> ready
[02:51:42] <trailethuy> ("p").click
[03:02:39] <xec> ussher_: what exactly is your goal?
[03:02:49] <xec> ussher_: and what have you tried so far?
[03:03:32] <ussher_> I want to have a form setup for input of values.  the structure of the table will vary for each table.  so it is a form for creating tables.
[03:04:57] <ussher_> so far I have tried to alter that example in the link above by adding another col to it.  That worked, but all the rows after the col was added were the wrong structure.  missing cols.
[03:05:39] <ussher_> from there, ive just been looking for a working example.  found a youtube vid with no links and that link above are the closest i've got.
[03:06:00] <ussher_> the youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYIwU5xjlB4
[03:06:35] <xec> could you make a jsfiddle.net demo?
[03:06:47] <ussher_> also found the exact quesiton on stackoverflow, but it was marked 'not constructive' and closed. :(
[03:06:54] <ussher_> sure
[03:08:06] <ph88> how can i delete the tbody of a table with jQuery ?
[03:08:29] <xec> $(".myTable tbody").remove() ?
[03:08:36] <ph88> thx :)
[03:09:33] <xec> "the" implies singular, but there can be multiple tbody on a single table, and that code would remove them all, just a heads up
[03:09:44] <ph88> that's ok
[03:09:48] <ph88> i didn't know about the remove() function
[03:13:14] <ussher_> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/dT9HJ/  add a few rows first by clicking on the name, value, then hit the +.  after you have a few rows, hit th 'add col' (that i put there. it doesnt work right.)  and see the col add, but not in all locations vertically/horizontally
[03:15:36] <xec> you made the "add col" code yourself right?
[03:15:46] <ussher_> right,
[03:15:53] <xec> why don't you make an "add row" button in the same fashion
[03:16:13] <xec> instead of copy/pasting that big chunk of whatever ;)
[03:17:24] <ussher_> that big chunk (needs to loose the jquery ui) allows the insertion of rows between rows.  and deletion of rows from wherever.  so i was hoping to emulate it on the col side of things
[03:18:18] <ussher_> its that paramRow that is hard-coded to only put 2 col row into the table that i'd like to figure out i think. (not sure.)
[03:18:27] <xec> ok, but lets start out with something simple that works first
[03:19:20] <ussher_> simple is great.
[03:19:42] <xec> the add row method could simply look at the number of cols in the row where the button is clicked, and create the correct number - but first you need to understand the code, and that big chunk is likely doing a lot more than you need, and not doing all that you need
[03:21:00] <ussher_> ill try creating a new jsfiddle with it simpler.
[03:21:09] <xec> so I suggest starting from scratch, make a simple table with an add row button in each row, and a add cols button
[03:22:31] <sysdef> hi. how can i find out if there is already a click event bound to an id? something like if($("#foo").click()){ ... }?
[03:24:13] <Cork> sysdef: generically you can't
[03:24:31] <Cork> sysdef: you can check the events jquery knows about as it keeps an internal list of those
[03:24:48] <Cork> $._data(elm, 'events')
[03:25:25] <Cork> sysdef: but you should normally not need to do this
[03:26:18] <Cork> also note it won't list inline event attributes or events added with the native addEventListener
[03:27:23] <xec> sysdef: if you're just curious (for debugging purposes), you can inspect it in chrome and look under evend listeners, but i'm not sure if/how you can check programatically
[03:30:27] <sysdef> when i clich the element the event starts x times. where x is the times i definded it
[03:30:31] <sysdef> click*
[03:31:02] <xec> makes sense
[03:31:39] <xec> not that I'm sure what "the event starts" really means
[03:31:48] <Cork> triggers i guess
[03:32:02] <xec> yeah, that's what I figure :)
[03:32:48] <xec> then maybe "times i definded it" the "it" is referring to number of elements instead of number of times the click handler is bound?
[03:33:12] <Cork> suspect he has a generic selector that matches the old and the new elements
[03:33:42] <crazydiamond> Hi. How do I track errors with jQuery, if error() method is deprecated?
[03:33:56] <Cork> crazydiamond: fail?
[03:34:32] <xec> lol, it sort of looks like you're telling him to fail
[03:34:38] <Cork> crazydiamond: the error/success ajax specific deferrers has been depricated
[03:34:54] <crazydiamond> Cork, does "fail" work the same way?
[03:34:55] <Cork> cause instead you should use the normal deferrer methods
[03:35:14] <crazydiamond> Cork, and was that all stuff just for AJAX errors?
[03:35:32] <Cork> crazydiamond: error is/was a pointer to fail, success a pointer to done and complete a pointer to always
[03:35:55] <Cork> crazydiamond: error, success and compete was ajax specific
[03:36:17] <sysdef> i thought a new click definition will overwrite the old one :s
[03:36:36] <Cork> sysdef: that's event attributes
[03:36:47] <ussher_> xec: Your Awesome!  Thanks very much.  I think I can manage from here. http://jsfiddle.net/Ht9sH/1/
[03:36:54] <Cork> sysdef: those used to be used back in the 90's
[03:37:44] <crazydiamond> Cork, and is there a way to track errors in general? I'm making a website, that doesn't work on iOS and I don't know why, but that must be JS errors. Can I get list of all errors, that are, e.g., written to console in Chrome?
[03:38:02] <Cork> sysdef: elm.onclick = function() {}; overwrites, elm.addEventListener('clicl', function() {}), doesn't; also those are two different pools
[03:38:26] <Cork> crazydiamond: you could try window.onerror
[03:41:18] <crazydiamond> Cork, thanks. so, I understand that jQuery haven't had any better alternative, and error() was AJAX-specific?
[03:41:28] <xec> ussher_: good :) I'm not sure what the ID code is doing in the add row method though, this code seems to do the exact same thing: http://jsfiddle.net/Ht9sH/2/
[03:41:32] <Cork> crazydiamond: yes
[03:41:41] <xec> ussher_: maybe you meant it for when creating a new col?
[03:42:03] <Cork> crazydiamond: but you can bind error with jquery too $(window).on('error', function() {});
[03:42:14] <Cork> it's the exact same event
[03:42:35] <sysdef> i think i'll use a var (foo_button_is_active) to prevent the double trigger
[03:42:43] <crazydiamond> Cork, great thanks
[03:42:46] <Cork> though jquery does some mockering with the event object, and that might not be what you want
[03:43:20] <Cork> sysdef: uh, why not fix the error instead ?!?
[03:44:07] <ussher_> xec: even better :)
[03:44:39] <ussher_> xec: im off now. much appreciated.  fun for tomorrow.
[03:46:55] <sysdef> Cork: it looks like bind a trigger several times to a button _is_ the error
[03:47:37] <Cork> sysdef: not trigger, called, you're binding over and over again most likely
[03:47:51] <Cork> sysdef: and that is most likely cause of a broken selector
[04:03:44] <blofeld> h

[04:11:07] <turkish> yes, we can say its the same
[04:11:39] <turkish> autoselect an option

[06:08:05] <Gonzo89> oh wait a second
[06:08:11] <Gonzo89> logical issue ^^
[06:08:14] <Gonzo89> second please
[06:08:25] <Cork> Gonzo89: logical?

[06:09:53] <motaka2> In this piece of code I cant call handle() in each() - What am I missing ?
[06:09:56] <motaka2> http://codepaste.net/w77pxd
[06:10:25] <clocKwize> hey guys, I need to google geocode a postcode on form submit, but obviously that would be asynchronousâ¦ should I block until a variable is true that is set in the callback or is that crap?
[06:11:25] <Cork> Gonzo89: where are you defining Egy.Units.Shls.Infos.Forms.Pub.handle ?
[06:12:07] <Cork> clocKwize: no, prevent the submit of the form, and when you get the response from the check make the submit again
[06:12:24] <clocKwize> hmm, i see
[06:12:38] <clocKwize> ta
[06:12:40] <clocKwize> good plan :)
[06:12:53] <Cork> clocKwize: $('form').submit(function(event) { var self = this; event.preventDefault(); $.get().done(function() { self.submit(); }); })
[06:13:16] <clocKwize> which will put the code in to an infinite loop! ?
[06:13:25] <Cork> no
[06:13:29] <motaka2> Cork: In this piece of code I cant call handle() in each() - What am I missing ? http://codepaste.net/w77pxd
[06:13:33] <clocKwize> or is submit callback not called if its called from code
[06:13:33] <Cork> $(self).submit() would though
[06:14:00] <Cork> form_element.submit() is a dom function
[06:14:04] <Cork> it does't trigger events
[06:14:07] <clocKwize> ok cool :) ta
[06:14:13] <Cork> $().submit() does though
[06:15:31] <Cork> motaka2: opps missed it was from you "here are you defining Egy.Units.Shls.Infos.Forms.Pub.handle ?" <-- this was for you
[06:15:49] <Cork> oh, wait
[06:15:51] <Cork> now i see
[06:15:59] <Cork> ok, let me read it though again
[06:16:20] <motaka2> Cork: thank you
[06:16:24] <bklane> Anyone know how to implement fuzzy search functionality with Select2?
[06:16:52] <Cork> motaka2: Egy.Units.Shls.Infos.Forms.Pub.handle isn't defined until after the anonymous function has ran
[06:17:20] <Cork> motaka2: move the each loop down to below the var handle declaration
[06:17:24] <Cork> and call handle() instead
[06:17:28] <Cork> that should work
[06:17:55] <DaVinciIT> hi all. I need to append a div as the First child of the div2. is it possible?
[06:18:11] <Cork> DeVito_: prepend
[06:18:16] <Cork> *DaVinciIT:
[06:18:16] <motaka2> Cork: thank you
[06:19:31] <motaka2> Cork: Am I doing good javascript code or that a spageti code considering the events I add in each ? (they are now commented) ?
[06:21:19] <DaVinciIT> Cork: hi.
[06:21:33] <Cork> motaka2: you arn't adding any event handlers
[06:22:23] <motaka2> Cork: it is commented in each loop
[06:22:34] <Cork> motaka2: you should write it in a different form
[06:22:55] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i have this very stupid problem: myid is undefined?! !!!!aaargh http://jsfiddle.net/Szm93/1/
[06:23:06] <Pymous> Hello
[06:23:25] <Pymous> I'm trying to listen to event after an append with this code : http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/73/
[06:23:31] <Pymous> But it's not working, any idea why ?
[06:24:02] <motaka2> Cork: Can you give me hint what the right form is ?
[06:24:22] <Cork> $("body").on("change", $.map(selectsToHandle, function(handle) { return 'select[name="' + handle.name + '"]'; }).join(','), function() {})
[06:24:35] <Cork> then you don't need to bind multiple listeners
[06:25:21] <Cork> Krambiorix: prop('id')
[06:25:30] <Krambiorix> Cork, why prop??
[06:25:39] <motaka2> Cork: thank you I saved it.
[06:25:46] <Cork> Krambiorix: cause jquery doens't have a property id
[06:26:01] <Cork> so you need to use prop('id') to request the property from the dom element
[06:26:35] <Cork> Pymous: you need to use delegated event listeners
[06:27:01] <Cork> Pymous: http://jsfiddle.net/CQKPu/74/
[06:27:53] <Pymous> Cork > I'm using JQuery 1.10.1
[06:28:01] <Cork> so?
[06:28:56] <Pymous> But it's working
[06:29:03] <Krambiorix> Cork, why not element.id??
[06:29:03] <Pymous> Weird, the doc say to use .on()
[06:29:05] <Pymous> Thanks
[06:29:44] <Cork> Krambiorix: sure you can use this.id or $(this)[0].id if you prefer
[06:29:54] <Krambiorix> ooow ok, i see it
[06:30:00] <Krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[06:50:43] <airdem> is it possible to make the js on a page that gets loaded into a dialog work?
[06:51:27] <Changa> Hello: $("#primarycontent div:first").after($(this).html()); any way I can load this content using a slideDown effect? how?
[06:53:14] <sammich> how do you get really 'pro' at JS?
[06:53:41] <sammich> I've been doing it for about 10 months now and I'd consider myself intermediate+
[06:54:10] <sammich> starting to lean less on jQuery
[06:54:14] <sammich> well, a lot less
[06:55:43] <md4d> hey there js community. question about jquery-pjax: how and when is the $.pjax.reload method called? https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax/blob/master/jquery.pjax.js#L352 there's no explanation and i couldnt figure it out. hints appreciated :) thanks!
[07:09:44] <tomkralidis> hi, I have a webapp which suppresses form submit/page reloading with something like https://dpaste.de/M3yFs/.  This works just great, however my form has a checkbox input, which, when clicked, makes the page submit.  Anyway to circumvent this?  tia
[07:10:34] <Changa> Hello: $("#primarycontent div:first").after($(this).html()); any way I can load this content using a slideDown effect? how?
[07:12:49] <melter> is there a way to restore link colors to the browser/user-set default?
[07:15:39] <BillCriswell> melter: $('a').css('color', 'auto') I believe.
[07:16:01] <BillCriswell> If that doesn't work maybe inherit?
[07:17:46] <melter> BillCriswell: "auto" isn't valid: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color
[07:17:58] <BillCriswell> Try inherit then.
[07:18:44] <melter> BillCriswell: that doesn't work either because the parent is screwed up. i tried setting the parent to "inherit" as well, but that doesn't work (in firefox, anyway)
[07:18:58] <melter> BillCriswell: I'm trying to work around a jquery ui problem.
[07:20:59] <Whirl3d> melter set it to null
[07:21:25] <Whirl3d> or ''
[07:21:35] <melter> Whirl3d: as in "color: null"?
[07:22:01] <Whirl3d> or :""
[07:22:16] <Whirl3d> If it's undefined, it should be forced to use the default, right?
[07:22:24] <Whirl3d> It's a guess
[07:24:00] <xec> Whirl3d: setting it to blank will remove the "color" property from the "inline" style on the element
[07:24:44] <xec> which is probably not what melter wants, if he wants to override the css file
[07:25:06] <Changa> Hello: $("#primarycontent div:first").after($(this).html()); any way I can load this content using a slideDown effect? how?
[07:25:18] <melter> that doesn't work either
[07:25:28] <Cork> Changa: why $(this).html() ?
[07:25:34] <Changa> loads content
[07:25:37] <Changa> from another php
[07:25:45] <Cork> no it serializes it and then parses it again
[07:26:17] <Changa> its a function that works after .load
[07:26:40] <Changa> $(this).html() is the div to be slided down :p
[07:26:41] <Cork> then what is the this variable in this context?
[07:26:50] <Cork> Changa: no
[07:27:03] <Changa> object?
[07:27:21] <BillCriswell> melter: Need to provide some demo code. We're just stabbing in the dark here.
[07:27:34] * xec stabs someone in the dark
[07:27:35] <Cork> assuming this is what it normally is, its a dom element $(this) wraps it in jquery and .html() serializes it to html
[07:27:39] <Cork> Changa: ^
[07:27:57] <Changa> yes Cork
[07:27:58] <Cork> that process is overcomplicating, and not needed
[07:28:10] <melter> BillCriswell: i'm using jquery ui, but the colors for the tab labels (which are "a" tags) are also used for links in the tab contents themselves
[07:28:35] <BillCriswell> xec: I hope it wasn't me!
[07:28:39] <Changa> Cork: fiddle is coming
[07:28:45] <melter> BillCriswell: you can use theme roller and firebug and add a link inside the tab content (like "<a href="/">home</a>")
[07:28:52] <Cork> Changa: so what you want is prob something like var clone = $(this).clone().hide(); $("#primarycontent div:first").after(clone); clone.slideDown(300);
[07:29:09] <melter> the "home" link won't be the browser link color
[07:29:55] <e01> hello, i have a selector $(item).find('img.ProductImage') which return me not a objects but something like this
[07:30:13] <e01> [img.ProductImage, prevObject: $.fn.init[1], context: div#tp--601289.tp, selector: "img.ProductImage", init: function, selector: ""â¦]
[07:30:23] <e01> why in this format?
[07:30:49] <Cork> e01: looks like a representation of a jquery object
[07:31:42] <e01> Cork: any idea how can i get like a normal jquery object?
[07:31:45] <Cork> e01: if it isn't then you might have a separate lib that does something similar to jquery
[07:32:02] <Cork> e01: you would have to look through the code in the page
[07:32:15] <Cork> e01: either it's a normal jquery object, or it isn't
[07:32:23] <Cork> if it isn't then it's not jquery at all
[07:32:49] <e01> Cork: in the scope i have other selectors like $(item).find('.node-title') which return me a good objects i can't understand why this with img not work :(
[07:33:21] <Cork> e01: the object you get back won't depend on the element matched by the selector
[07:33:45] <BillCriswell> melter: In jQuery UI the color for links cascades from pretty deep. Why do you need them to be default?
[07:33:54] <Changa> Cork: you got me confused, why do I need to clone it? it works like this but without the slideDown... -> http://jsfiddle.net/aa5jb/
[07:34:31] <Cork> Changa: if you seralize the dom element to html; you are basically cloning it
[07:34:36] <Cork> but in a more costly form
[07:34:50] <Cork> dom element > html string > reparse to a new dom element
[07:35:00] <Cork> vs dom element > clone to new dom element
[07:35:18] <Changa> ok let me give a try to what you wrote
[07:35:44] <BillCriswell> e01: Try the same selector with jQuery() instead of $()
[07:36:01] <melter> BillCriswell: i just wanted all the links on my site to have a consistent look
[07:36:47] <Changa> it works Cork: thank you - so we just skipped the middle step here
[07:37:24] <Cork> Changa: well you could have done var clone = $($(this).html()).hide(); if you wanted, but it just doens't really make sense :)
[07:38:52] <e01> BillCriswell: nope, it work work
[07:39:03] <Changa> thanks Cork
[07:39:37] <Cork> melter: what is it your trying to solve?
[07:44:12] <gonnarule> hi everyone
[07:45:06] <anew> array(1) { ["port"]=> array(5) { ["name"]=> string(0) "" ["type"]=> string(0) "" ["tmp_name"]=> string(0) "" ["error"]=> int(4) ["size"]=> int(0) } }
[07:45:16] <Pymous> nice array
[07:45:21] <gonnarule> facing some problem with loading jquery.validate.js. I can see the script tag loading it in my page (just above the jquery 1.8.2 loading script), but when trying to use it I got the message : object # has no method 'validate'
[07:45:26] <anew> bah wrong channel
[07:45:28] <anew> sorry #jquery
[07:46:12] <BillCriswell> Just be careful next time. We don't take kindly to accidental php array postings round here.
[07:46:17] <anew> lmao
[07:46:38] <melter> Cork: i'm trying to get the content inside a jquery ui tab to look the same as content outside the tab
[07:47:57] <BillCriswell> a, .ui-tabs .ui-tabs-nav li a { color: blue; }
[07:48:00] <melter> if i change ".ui-widget-content a" in the jquery ui css file to ".ui-widget-content > a", that seems to work
[07:48:27] <BillCriswell> a, .ui-widget-content a { color: blue; }
[07:48:28] <BillCriswell>  =)
[07:48:44] <melter> BillCriswell: that's not necessarily the default color :)
[07:55:50] <BillCriswell> If you want to be that picky about it, you can look into like.. color: -webkit-anylink; and find it for each browser and I hope at the end it's all blue.
[07:56:45] <BillCriswell> melter: ^^
[08:01:59] <melter> BillCriswell: like -moz-hyperlinktext and -moz-visitedhyperlinktext
[08:02:28] <BillCriswell> Haha I guess.
[08:10:31] <gonnarule> no idea anyone ? =/
[08:11:30] <p3rror> hello
[08:11:43] <p3rror> please how to keep the div as parent of the img class delete
[08:11:43] <p3rror> http://pastebin.com/QaAt4yQN
[08:13:07] <gonnarule> p3rror : don't understand
[08:13:29] <p3rror> gonnarule, I need that the div became parent of the image class delete
[08:13:47] <gonnarule> it isn't ?
[08:14:06] <p3rror> gonnarule, no and I don't know why
[08:14:13] <gonnarule> you have div > a > img
[08:14:18] <gonnarule> so div is a parent of img
[08:14:56] <p3rror> gonnarule, when I do an  alert(parent.attr('id')); I got an undefined
[08:15:25] <gonnarule> what do you want to achieve p3rror ?
[08:15:32] <p3rror> gonnarule, OK
[08:15:45] <p3rror> gonnarule, I need to remove row from table
[08:16:03] <p3rror> gonnarule, please hold on I will paste the hole script
[08:16:12] <gonnarule> because jQuery(".deleve").parents("div").remove should remove the div and its content
[08:16:18] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: What does your selector look like?
[08:16:33] <gonnarule> my selector ?
[08:16:59] <gonnarule> i can paste some code BillCriswell, brb
[08:17:05] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Ok.
[08:17:22] <p3rror> gonnarule, http://pastebin.com/gVgmBT6Z
[08:20:26] <p3rror> gonnarule, you see
[08:20:32] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : http://pastebin.com/1hL1gvPq
[08:21:05] <gonnarule> p3rror : you're using parent() instead of parents()
[08:21:37] <gonnarule> parent() only returns first parent met, and if it doesn't match your filter then it's undefined
[08:22:22] <gonnarule> you could use parents which go through all parents and use a filter and eq(0) to get the first parent of the type 'div' for example (not sure about the eq but should be)
[08:23:31] <dannydagger> hey.. can someone try to tell me why my jquery breaks when i toggle media queries (minimize the browser and resize back up) ? www.colorworld.se/testing123
[08:23:40] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Put the validate code before </head> and see if that helps?
[08:24:03] <p3rror> gonnarule, but it should work using only parent()
[08:24:14] <gonnarule> p3rror no it shouldn't
[08:24:35] <gonnarule> p3rror : your structure is div > a > img not div > img
[08:24:47] <grafi> dannydagger what "breaks" ?
[08:25:03] <p3rror> gonnarule, yeah
[08:25:25] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : I should put my script document.ready () into the head ? odd no ?
[08:25:50] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: You only include the plugin if the window is big enough, but you call the plugin no matter what.
[08:26:37] <gonnarule> p3rror : so, when you do img.parent("div"), the first and parent your img has is "a", which is not a "div". Parent only parse 1 level up, so it stops after the "a", and returns undefined because "a" is not "div".
[08:27:22] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Try it and see.
[08:27:31] <p3rror> gonnarule, yes that is thank you
[08:27:34] <dannydagger> grafi: everything breaks.. the portfolio is not hoverable, the navbar loses .sticky.. the contact form doesn't work in media queries at all
[08:27:37] <BillCriswell> Also, does $.fn.validate return anything in the console?
[08:27:51] <dannydagger> BillCriswell: I dont follow what u mean mate :/
[08:28:25] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: You have if ($(window).width() >= breakpoint) { $.HoverDir ... }
[08:28:35] <BillCriswell> in main.js
[08:28:36] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : I can't put anything into <head>, we use a portal and have no (easy) access to the <head> part of the pages. Furthermore, I did a little page offline, with only jquery+validate.js and it works perfectly
[08:29:17] <gonnarule> $.fn.validate TypeError: Cannot read property 'fn' of undefined
[08:29:41] <BillCriswell> How about jQuery.fn.validate
[08:29:48] <gonnarule> just "undefined"
[08:29:59] <dannydagger> BillCriswell: yes but thats only for certain plugins, not for the whole site
[08:31:23] <gonnarule> Btw I'm a bit lost with the way jQuery is called by $ or jQuery or others... native call is jQuery right ? And $ is a shortcut defined somewhere ?
[08:31:32] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Yes.
[08:31:40] <dannydagger> but also, that line should put the jquery to work again when it has been resized back up shouldn't it?
[08:32:00] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: The plugin that's giving you the error is because of that code.
[08:32:17] <gonnarule> because jquery.validate.js refers to "$.", when we only use "jQuery.". Could it be a problem ? (How to see if "$" is functionnal ?)
[08:32:45] <BillCriswell> dannydagger: $.fn.hoverdir is not in that conditional, but it called $.HoverDiv which is in the conditional.
[08:32:47] <gonnarule> Even more, we use jsp to create our html, and use some ${} syntax from el-elements. Any conflict possible ?
[08:33:04] <BillCriswell> but it calls*
[08:33:21] <p3rror> gonnarule, how to use filter on parents()
[08:34:02] <gonnarule> p3rror : you can try something like : jQuery("img.delete").parents("div:eq(0)").remove()
[08:34:10] <gonnarule> p3rror : say me if it works
[08:34:15] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: If jQuery.fn.validate returns undefined something else is up.
[08:34:34] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Any errors in the console?
[08:34:47] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'validate'
[08:35:02] <gonnarule> because I'm calling the .validate() method
[08:35:26] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: Is there anything before that though?
[08:35:36] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : no, only this one
[08:35:50] <BillCriswell> You said you see the request happen though, right?
[08:36:53] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : on chrome, using shift+ctrl+i, then > Resources, I can see the jquery.validate.js file is loaded and browse the code into it
[08:37:31] <Dooces> would someone be able to tell me wtf kind of time format this is: /&:83!37:72!/5-61!1?181&-4:(8?/&/&/!-?-
[08:37:57] <hashpuppy> what do you guys use for notifications?  roll your own or use something like jnotify, top bar notification, pines, etc...?
[08:38:12] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : but the code is like : (function($) {  $.extend($.fn, {, which use $. Maybe it's conflicting with el-elements from the jsp ? could it ? (even if it's .js and not .jsp ?) We're using .vm files too (velocity, using the $ too)
[08:38:32] <p3rror> gonnarule, it's worked
[08:38:44] <p3rror> gonnarule, So now I have to remove the hole row
[08:38:45] <gonnarule> p3rror : cool :)
[08:39:34] <p3rror> gonnarule, may be I have to define something like <tr id="">
[08:39:38] <BillCriswell> gonnarule: As long as (jQuery) is at the end of the plugin it's fine. Which I assume it is.
[08:40:09] <gonnarule> p3rror : well, just get one level up more to the "td". so jQuery("img.delete").parents("td:eq(0)").remove()
[08:40:15] <BillCriswell> (function($){ /* You can use $ in here no matter what. */ })(jQuery);
[08:40:33] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : indeed it is.
[08:41:31] <BillCriswell> Without seeing what's actually going on kind of tough to help.
[08:42:41] <gonnarule> BillCriswell : I understand. Btw we use Liferay 5.2.3 as a portal if you know it. Maybe part of the problem is there as it (should) load a jquery on its own, which we override in the themes we use with jquery 1.8.2
[08:43:12] <gonnarule> btw I've got to go. Hope I'll find something tomorrow, this is getting annoying.
[08:43:17] <gonnarule> Thanks for the help though
[08:43:56] * gonnarule is awat
[08:43:58] * gonnarule is away
[08:54:00] <jnewt> how do i get just the keys from [{"this":1,"this":"foo"..},{...] from json without looping through all of the data?
[08:56:08] <BillCriswell> jnewt: You'll have to loop.
[08:57:18] <whatthepoop> anyone have any recommendations for a form validator plugin that works with HTML5 'form' attribute as used within each form field (form fields are *not* children of the <form> node)?
[08:57:26] <BillCriswell> jnewt: If you're using underscore there's _.keys( obj ); It's still looping, though.
[08:57:48] <whatthepoop> both jquery validation and parsley do not seem to work, and I have fiddles to support my findings if anyone is interested
[08:58:45] <Nanor> Hey, what would be a good jquery function for listening for when a user swipes over a div on a tablet?
[09:00:10] <NoiseEee> jnewt: you have to loop because you are in an array, but you can get the keys of each inner object with Object.keys in supported browsers http://jsfiddle.net/HYA9J/
[09:02:02] <duch_kazatel> Nanor - I don't think there's a native jquery function for doing that.  you're going to have to roll your own or use a plugin
[09:02:04] <jnewt> BillCriswell, NoiseEee:  is there a way to get out of the loop after the first pass, like a break instruction?
[09:02:44] <NoiseEee> afaik no, not without throwing a bum exception
[09:03:05] <NoiseEee> or https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=JavaScript%2FReference%2FGlobal_Objects%2FArray%2Fevery
[09:03:06] <duch_kazatel> javascript has a break statement,
[09:03:26] <duch_kazatel> iterate yourself, then when you find your match, break
[09:03:27] <NoiseEee> ah true enough
[09:03:42] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/break
[09:05:22] <duch_kazatel> you can also use the return statement: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return
[09:06:11] <ObiWlanKenobi> http://pastebin.com/2u0RMTw4 LINes 73 and 74 doesnt work?!!??!?!!?
[09:07:13] <duch_kazatel> ObiWlanKenobi - is there an element on the page with the id "base64encimg"
[09:07:13] <duch_kazatel> ?
[09:07:45] <ObiWlanKenobi> yes its a input type hidden element
[09:08:32] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle with markup would be helpful, then, because there's no way for me to know wtf is broken from looking at that.
[09:09:16] <ObiWlanKenobi> i can put it there
[09:11:22] <ObiWlanKenobi> http://jsfiddle.net/hhY3L/
[09:11:28] <ObiWlanKenobi> that is link
[09:12:11] <duch_kazatel> that's... not valid - you need to break the problem down to just the html and js.  no php or anything like that....

[09:12:30] <Jacobd_> Good morning, I'm having trouble getting some listeners to attach to multiple elements in a dynamically generated modal, any chance someone could take a look and tell me where I've gone wrong?  http://pastebin.com/mSAYkEhY
[09:12:49] <BillCriswell> to jnewt.
[09:13:22] <ObiWlanKenobi> so what can i do?
[09:13:41] <Jacobd_> I've got a window spawning with three buttons ( "X", "Submit", and "Cancel" ), I need to attach Omniture tracking to all three buttons to capture events for a crazy lady
[09:14:33] <Jacobd_> all three are button elements, and the script currently only attaches to the first button it finds
[09:15:05] <ObiWlanKenobi> i dont understand
[09:16:51] <ObiWlanKenobi> pff
[09:17:06] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i'm at work - things are a little busy atm.
[09:17:11] <duch_kazatel> sorry i can't be helpful.
[09:18:22] <Ernest> hello
[09:18:30] <Jacobd_> Howdy Ernest
[09:19:12] <Ernest> does anyone have a log of this chat from 14hours ago ?
[09:19:13] <ner0x> https://gist.github.com/fswitalski/6166015  Okay so lines 170-235   If the dialog opens and I hit cancel... then I open the dialog again it causes both function references to be executed. THis should be an easy fix I just don't understand the process. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
[09:19:21] <Ernest> i did not have logging enabled :(
[09:19:41] <NoiseEee> is that coffeescript ner0x?
[09:19:51] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Yes, sorry it's what rails typically uses.
[09:20:30] <jop008> I have unbalanced ( ) but I don't see it Chrome generates on console unexpected end of input
[09:21:24] <NoiseEee> ner0x: try stepping through the debugger maybe? can't really debug coffeescript here, you can try setting up a fiddle
[09:21:36] <jop008> is there a way to compile javasciprt?
[09:21:37] <ner0x> Well it's more a question on how click events are added etc.
[09:21:49] <NoiseEee> ner0x: well ideally they are added a single time.
[09:21:55] <duch_kazatel> jop008 - why do you ask?
[09:22:09] <jop008> to have a good syntax checker
[09:22:09] <NoiseEee> ner0x: if things are being added/removed, then you should use event delegation on a common/permanent parent.
[09:22:37] <Ernest> anyone?\
[09:22:57] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Right. The top modal is common and permanent. I'm wondering why if it's called more than once it fires all the references sent.
[09:23:03] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Rather than the single reference sent.
[09:23:29] <NoiseEee> ner0x: no reason unless you're adding the 'on' event more than once :)
[09:23:36] <NoiseEee> ner0x: i'd try the debugger at this point
[09:23:41] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Ah! I am.
[09:23:46] <ner0x> Evertime the function is called.
[09:23:56] <ner0x> s/Evertime/everytime
[09:23:58] <Ernest> hi, i am trying to number the top 10 list from 1- 10, http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/30/
[09:24:40] <BillCriswell> Ernest: + 1.
[09:24:53] <Ernest> where about
[09:24:56] <Ernest> i tried that
[09:25:16] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Let me tinker. I think I figured it out.
[09:25:19] <BillCriswell> rank.text(i + 1 )
[09:25:25] <NoiseEee> ner0x: a'ight!
[09:25:52] <Ernest> omg
[09:25:57] <Ernest> thx
[09:26:16] <Ernest> i was trying this last  night and was not working , i dont understand why it works now :s
[09:26:32] <Ernest> what a headache
[09:26:37] <Ernest> thx BillCriswell
[09:26:52] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:27:21] <Ernest> someone mentioned last night that every $( selector call eats up memory
[09:27:28] <Ernest> is this true
[09:27:53] <duch_kazatel> it'
[09:28:13] <duch_kazatel> *it's not something i would worry about right now if I were you unless you're doing soemthing really weird.
[09:28:18] <Jacobd_> If someone would happen to be able to give me an ear, my problem should be simple enough to solve, I'm just not seeing it.  How can I set up this snippet ( http://pastebin.com/mSAYkEhY ) to attach the "click" listener to all three button elements in a spawned element?  Right now it only attaches to the first one in the structure
[09:28:21] <Gmac_> does jquery no longer except the css(backgroundPosition ...
[09:29:07] <ner0x> NoiseEee: BOOM FIXED.
[09:29:17] <Ernest> oky :0
[09:29:19] <Ernest> :) thx
[09:29:26] <NoiseEee> ner0x: qu'est-ce que le deal?
[09:29:43] <duch_kazatel> Jacobd_ - it's really hard to help when we don't have any markup to work with.
[09:29:45] <ner0x> NoiseEee: I don't speak spanish Baxtor!
[09:30:04] <Jacobd_> okay
[09:30:09] <NoiseEee> ner0x: terrible french, 'whats the deal'
[09:30:24] <ner0x> NoiseEee: I know, I was quoting Anchorman. lol
[09:30:26] <ner0x> NoiseEee: https://gist.github.com/6166127
[09:30:27] <BillCriswell> You are a whole wheel of cheese?
[09:30:51] <BillCriswell> ate*
[09:31:00] <ner0x> NoiseEee: Moved them out of the function call so they are initiated once; problem fixed. I'll move them to a global call now so I won't have to do that in each .js file. Wonderful.
[09:31:07] <NoiseEee> ner0x: nice.
[09:31:19] <bray9082> is it possible to add an image map to lightbox
[09:31:27] <Ernest> i am using 1 variable with stored selector instead of selecting the selector 3 times, if that makes any sense
[09:32:51] <BillCriswell> Ernest: You're doing it right then.
[09:35:39] <naeluh> yo!
[09:35:47] <naeluh> Hows it going
[09:36:36] <BillCriswell> Where you work do you guys have people right next to you on the phone for 90% of the day?
[09:36:55] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell - I used to.
[09:36:56] <naeluh> I don't
[09:37:21] <naeluh> I see people on there smart phone for 90% of the day
[09:37:29] <naeluh> haha
[09:38:23] <BillCriswell> That would be fine for me. My boss is always talking on the phone though.
[09:38:36] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[09:38:48] <bray9082> is it possible to add an image map to lightbox
[09:39:12] <BillCriswell> It sucks most cause half of what he says is just wrong / misinformed so I can't help but to get annoyed cause I know I'll have to clear things up later.
[09:39:12] <naeluh> dude I had a job where the dude I worked for was always walking around talking on speaker phone on his cell it was the most annoying shit ever
[09:39:45] <naeluh> jesus
[09:39:59] <BillCriswell> Jesus indeed.
[09:40:20] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell - is he qualified to talk about those things?
[09:40:24] <grafi> slap him with your keyboard ^^
[09:41:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I have my doubts. He's not a programmer / developer at all.
[09:41:25] <naeluh> one the keyboards best uses in my opinon
[09:41:42] <naeluh> oops imo*
[09:41:51] <grafi> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHZxeR0uXQE
[09:42:05] <naeluh> BillCriswell: that is damn annoying shit
[09:42:07] <grafi> totally
[09:42:22] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell That sucks.  I used to have coworkers like that.  I wound up just giving up trying to help.  When they'd hand me the clients I'd spend a bunch of time having to explain why the account managers were wrong.
[09:43:26] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's brutal. You end up looking like the bad guy.
[09:43:38] <duch_kazatel> Not really.
[09:43:48] <duch_kazatel> Clients wound up really liking me because i didn't lie to them.
[09:44:03] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I feel like I do. I get cranky clients who said "Well, the person I spoke to said X  was possible"
[09:44:22] <duch_kazatel> i would up coming up with alternatives that generally served their needs better.
[09:44:31] <naeluh> ohgod I knoiw that one for sure
[09:45:01] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: When you work on a very limited platform your hands are tied though.
[09:45:38] <duch_kazatel> I worked in a place like that :)
[09:45:47] <duch_kazatel> my alternatives were always things that we all ready did.
[09:45:47] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: It's driving me nuts.
[09:46:09] <duch_kazatel> what industry do you work in?
[09:46:30] <BillCriswell> We do mostly ecommerce.
[09:46:36] <duch_kazatel> hah
[09:47:06] <duch_kazatel> good times.
[09:47:34] <BillCriswell> i consider myself a front-end guy, btu lately I've been doing more back end stuff trying to break things to get them to work how my boss suggested it would.
[09:47:52] <duch_kazatel> at a certain point, i'd consider looking for a new job hahaha
[09:47:55] <duch_kazatel> they must pay you well.
[09:48:05] <BillCriswell> Not as good as it should be.
[09:48:33] <BillCriswell> Not that good at all actually.
[09:49:03] <lhunath> when I do $('#foo').data('section', 5); shouldn't this selector match: '#foo[data-section=5]'?
[09:49:07] <Jacobd_> well, it looks like my problem is that there is another script somewhere halting my listener propagation.  Sorry to bother you folks, have a great day
[09:50:46] <grafi> sounds terrible BillCriswell :P
[09:51:02] <BillCriswell> I need to make some more code public and get my resume out.
[09:51:09] <grafi> dont we all
[09:54:40] <aro> does anyone know of a way to imitate the banner functionality on google+
[09:55:04] <BillCriswell> aro: What "banner functionality" exactly?
[09:55:14] <BillCriswell> Not sure exactly what you mean.
[09:55:21] <aro> https://plus.google.com/+starbucks/posts
[09:55:24] <aro> scroll up and down
[09:55:40] <maxmoore14> random css question if anyone willing to help... http://jsbin.com/ajiber/2/edit
[09:55:58] <duch_kazatel> you mean the parralax scrolling effect?
[09:56:03] <maxmoore14> I would have thought clear: right would do what I'm looking for, but clearly not!
[09:56:13] <aro> yeah
[09:56:31] <duch_kazatel> maxmoore14 - what are you trying to do?
[09:57:02] <maxmoore14> need to style div.test in that example so that it really does clear right
[09:57:28] <maxmoore14> need "additional content" on next line
[09:58:19] <BillCriswell> aro: Not sure there's a plugin that'll do exactly that.  You'd probably want to look into the "waypoints" plugin though. You basically want to do something when you hit the bottom of the banner.
[09:58:30] <BillCriswell> aro: http://imakewebthings.com/jquery-waypoints/
[09:59:34] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[09:59:40] <maxmoore14> duch_kazatel: what do you think?
[09:59:48] <Bloomberg> Someone has seen some example of jquery tabs with pagination?
[10:00:11] <maxmoore14> I think the issue is div.test has a height of 0
[10:00:36] <thorie> anyone know how i can get XDomainRequest working with jQuery ajax calls?
[10:02:04] <Niels_> Hi - I'm pretty new to jquery, looking for some help with filtering a response from AJAX - What I get back is a page with html head (including js/css), body with divs and such, and I want to remove that all from the response and filter td/tr (table) data and append that to the table body.. But I can't get the selection right. . This is what I'm trying to do: var results = $(data).find('#orderresult'); - but it doesn't find anything 
[10:02:33] <BillCriswell> googles classnames scare the shit out of me.
[10:03:39] <adamgoose> Best way to merge $("form").serialize() with $("table").dataTables().fnGetData()?
[10:03:48] <maxmoore14> I'm good, nevermind: http://jsbin.com/ajiber/3/edit
[10:04:00] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: What does fnGetData() return?
[10:04:19] <adamgoose> BillCriswell object
[10:04:56] <BillCriswell> If it returns an array of names and value objects you can do like var merged = $.extend( {}, $("form").serializeArray(), $("table").dataTables().fnGetData() );
[10:05:28] <adamgoose> and $.extend will return an object that I can pass into an $.ajax()'s data property, right?
[10:05:56] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: serializeArray() will, but I don't know .fnGetData()s structure to know for that.
[10:07:34] <adamgoose> Unfortunately that's not an associative array, which makes server-side processing incredibly difficult!
[10:08:18] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: You could probably loop through .fnGetData() and get it into an array like [ { name: 'fieldname', value: '123' } ] and have it work.
[10:08:35] <adamgoose> It's not .fnGetData() that's Ð problem, it's $.serializeArray()
[10:08:50] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: Oh... ok.
[10:09:12] <adamgoose> I'm thinking I'm going to have to do some sort of loop anyway at this rate...
[10:09:17] <adamgoose> Unless I pass all Ð inputs manually.
[10:11:56] <Niels_> Does anyone know what's wrong with the filter I'm trying to do on the data?
[10:13:53] <adamgoose> BillCriswell Is there a way to serialize a form into an object, rather than an Array?
[10:13:57] <adamgoose> without looping?
[10:14:24] <BillCriswell> Don't believe so
[10:14:32] <adamgoose> Suck. :P okay, thanks. :)
[10:14:42] <BillCriswell> You're the second person who came in here today who doesn't want to loop. I don't get it lol
[10:14:42] <Gmac_> check out inmonsey.com the console
[10:14:55] <Gmac_> y am i getting an error background position is undefined?
[10:15:01] <adamgoose> BillCriswell ain't nobody got time for that. I'm a PHP dev, not a JS dev! lol
[10:15:07] <adamgoose> I like my associative arrays!
[10:16:31] <duch_kazatel> adamgoose - are you trying to access things by name?
[10:16:32] <BillCriswell> It's such a simple loop though.
[10:17:22] <duch_kazatel> because if you use objects with properties, you can access things by name if you want.
[10:17:27] <duch_kazatel> different data structure, though
[10:17:53] <aro> how do i prevent an absolutely positioned element from taking upp all the space in a section
[10:17:56] <adamgoose> duch_kazatel I'm trying to get a form to a json object. I know how to use them, just not how to get a form value into one. :P
[10:18:18] <BillCriswell> var data = $('form').serializeArray(); dataObj = {}; for( var i = 0; i < data.length; i++ ) { dataObj[ data[i].name ] = data[i].value; }
[10:18:35] <duch_kazatel> ah, yeah.  that's about all you can do in that case.
[10:18:58] <BillCriswell> first ; should be a ,
[10:18:59] <adamgoose>       $.each(form.serializeArray(), function(key, value) {
[10:18:59] <adamgoose>         data[value['name']] = value['value'];
[10:18:59] <adamgoose>       });
[10:19:03] <BillCriswell> but you get the idea.
[10:20:01] <adamgoose> rather         data[value.name] = value.value;
[10:20:21] <adamgoose> where data = {};
[10:20:34] <BillCriswell> Oh we got it.
[10:20:49] <adamgoose> Then I just add data['permissions'] = .fnGetdata();
[10:21:03] <awc737> How could I access this cookie from my app? (from the API documentation):
[10:21:07] <awc737> Log in a user with their username and password. If successful, the browser will save a secure cookie for their session.
[10:22:24] <BillCriswell> awc737: What's the cookie's name?
[10:22:27] <awc737> sid
[10:22:36] <awc737> I also have a jquery cookie plugin
[10:22:41] <awc737> but $.cookie('sid') outputs nothing
[10:23:11] <adamgoose> BillCriswell I'm all set - thanks for your help. Even though I'm stubborn... :P
[10:23:20] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: No problem!
[10:23:24] <awc737> BillCriswell, my app is at me.dev, the API is at api.me.dev
[10:24:03] <BillCriswell> awc737: So you're trying to read a cookie from another domain?
[10:27:41] <awc737> BillCriswell, I suppose I must use the returned sid, and set the cookie on this domain
[10:28:00] <awc737> is that safe? to use a returned JSON string and do $.cookie('sid', value);
[10:28:32] <awc737> basically the API requires the sid for all further requests
[10:32:56] <awc737> BillCriswell, is http://localhost:2403/users/me really a cross domain though?
[10:34:33] <Krambiorix> can someone take a look at this? the element is not droppable... http://pastebin.com/P3UmfDmh
[10:37:42] <Niels_> I made some progress but still not getting exactly what I want.. I want to select all td/tr inside a div from ajax results.. e.g. <tr><td>31</td><td> - I can do var results = $(data).filter('#orderresult'); but this selects the <div id="orderresult"> itself as well and I want to exclude that. I tried var results = $(data).filter('#orderresult tr'); but that doesn't work. Anyone have an idea?
[10:38:09] <BillCriswell> Niels_: $(data).find('tr')
[10:38:43] <newbert> At my site http://www.nolabyg.com/g > I have made my nav change to a mini_nav when scrolled below 800px. The nav expands on mouseover. This is a problem on phones and other none mouseover devices. Can anyone help direct me to where the mouseover event code is so I can change it to mouseclick?
[10:39:14] <newbert> Sorry, the site is at: http://www.nolabyg.com/c
[10:39:51] <json-smith> anyone interested in solving an equalheights problem after prepending a div (content)
[10:40:13] <Niels_> BillCriswell: Thanks - but that doesn't give any result
[10:40:31] <json-smith> issue being only in IE (surprisingly)
[10:41:00] <json-smith> any takers?
[10:41:12] <BillCriswell> Niels_: Is data just an html string or <tr>s ?
[10:41:47] <adamgoose> BillCriswell Running into another issue... :P
[10:42:14] <adamgoose>       $.each($("#userPermissions").dataTable().fnGetData(), function(key, value) {
[10:42:14] <adamgoose>         permissions[value.0] = value.1;
[10:42:14] <adamgoose>       });
[10:42:16] <adamgoose> since value is an array with no key names...
[10:42:26] <adamgoose> line 2 there has an unexpected token =
[10:42:39] <BillCriswell> adamgoose: value[0] and value[1] I think is what you want.
[10:43:14] <adamgoose> You got it! Thanks a ton. :)
[10:43:19] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is there a way to do an action when something is displayed?
[10:43:20] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[10:43:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> for example, if a form is visible, a function should be called
[10:44:01] <Niels_> BillCriswell: It appears at the bottom of a bunch of html/head/body (inside the body) - here's an example: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=tMyFQ3FA
[10:44:14] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: You can do like if( $('#someForm').is(':visible') ) { }
[10:44:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and to check if an element exists?
[10:44:53] <BillCriswell> $('#someForm').length
[10:45:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so if it doesn't exist, that will give 0?
[10:45:36] <BillCriswell> Correct.
[10:46:25] <json-smith> While these guys are splitting the atom, can anyone help with my simple issu of equalling column heights?
[10:46:32] <naeluh> hey why I am getting an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier here  http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/agK9V/ thanks ?
[10:46:49] <alexkaare> how would I create a qunit test for mousemove?
[10:47:08] <BillCriswell> naeluh: you have else()
[10:47:22] <BillCriswell> You probably want else if
[10:47:32] <blindMoe> OT: any sublime text 2 folks in here?
[10:47:42] <duch_kazatel> I use ST2
[10:47:56] <blindMoe> duch_kazatel: know of a plugin that will replace the mini map with a function browser?
[10:48:16] <blindMoe> I knoiw I can cmd+R but sometimes it is nice to just have it in the sidevar
[10:48:20] <blindMoe> *sidebar
[10:49:16] <duch_kazatel> not that i'm aware of.
[10:50:05] <blindMoe> fiugured it was worth an ask
[10:50:09] <blindMoe> man I can't type today
[10:50:21] <duch_kazatel> you could always look for the plugin and then hide the minimap.
[10:50:42] <BillCriswell> json-smith: Just put the code up somewhere and explain the issue.
[10:52:06] <json-smith> http://pastebin.com/B8hQvK3T     marked where I need to recalculate
[10:53:09] <hye> i am using jquery mobile... and styling the checkboxes... anyway to make the label go to the next line that is associated with the checkbox rather than next to it?
[10:53:27] <blindMoe> kill the float / display: inline  ?
[10:53:28] <json-smith> Prior to the prepend - both columns were exactly the same height, but after prepend the first column spills over into the footer
[10:54:26] <hye> blindMoe are you talking to me?
[10:54:36] <blindMoe> hye: yeap
[10:54:59] <hye> i tried display: inline. but that broke the styling completely
[10:55:10] <hye> i even tried display: block
[10:55:32] <hye> let me do:  clear: both;
[10:55:50] <hye> nope doesnt work
[10:56:51] <duch_kazatel> hye: a functioning example of what you have up on jsfiddle helps a lot.  without being able to see the problem, we'll be forced to list solution after solution, none of which might not actually help solve the problem.
[10:57:25] <hye> does jsfiddle do jquery mobile? i couldnt find the script reference on there
[10:57:36] <hye> plus this is too simple for a demo, someone who knows will know i am thinking
[10:57:52] <json-smith> hye - don't know if this helps - try wrapping in a relative div and position absolute children
[10:58:10] <BillCriswell> json-smith: What's is the height based off of? The tallest one?
[10:58:53] <naeluh> cool thanks that worked BillCriswell but why is it not removing class ?
[10:59:07] <json-smith> BillCriswell - yes initially the height gets set to the tallest so that I can then create a separating border
[10:59:47] <BillCriswell> naeluh: It's probably because the condition isn't met.
[10:59:50] <hye> i think i will just force the label to a smaller size and give it a fixed width. then put the actual label in a seperate div below
[11:00:00] <naeluh> wrd ok thats what I though
[11:00:03] <naeluh> t
[11:00:15] <BillCriswell> json-smith: So you're adding a new one and you want to recalculate that?
[11:01:18] <David_Bradbury> Small wall of text incoming in 10 seconds:
[11:01:27] <hye> the suckey thing about jquery mobile is that when it stylizes things in mobile... it adds such a lag that, the phone says "the site is unresponive, continue to wait?"
[11:01:32] <David_Bradbury> Right now, when using the 'on' event handler, I prefer to use the object syntax such as $(".foo").on({click: function(e){bar()}, hover: function(e){baz()}}) as it lets me assign multiple handlers cleanly. Live was depreciated, and I would like to use 'on' for newly created elements. This requires something like $("document").on("click", ".foo", function(){}); - Is there a way that I can...
[11:01:33] <David_Bradbury> ...maintain the object-literal style I prefer while achieving what I am looking to do?
[11:02:12] <json-smith> Prepending data to column1 (for sake of argument) which makes that bigger and the parent div is not resized either. Columns are cleared - only occurs on first visit and refresh shows correct heights
[11:02:38] <Niels_> BillCriswell: Don't mean to push - did that pastebin help with getting the tr/tds? http://pastebin.com/tMyFQ3FA it is
[11:03:12] <json-smith> http://www.visitstannes.info/recreation-and-entertainment/football/kevtest.php     is the page where I am testing
[11:03:38] <json-smith> using IE10
[11:03:42] <BillCriswell> Niels_: Why are <tr>s children of <div>s? that could be causing issues.
[11:03:45] <json-smith> works in firefox
[11:04:11] <BillCriswell> Niels_: Change orderresults to a table then do var $trs = $(response).find('tr'); and you should be cool
[11:05:22] <BillCriswell> json-smith: If it's loading images you might have to put the widths and heights on them
[11:05:55] <Niels_> BillCriswell: It is something I added later, since I needed something to filter on. The idea is that I already have the table, I just need to update the table contents with the results I get. I'll try out what you suggested.
[11:06:14] <json-smith> I am prepending a relatively positioned DIV - height 62px
[11:06:20] <BillCriswell> Niels_: If you don't need the container just do $(response).filter('tr')
[11:06:45] <BillCriswell> Niels_: Without orderedresults at all
[11:08:02] <BillCriswell> Niels_: http://jsbin.com/oquvoz/1/edit
[11:08:05] <Niels_> I initially had it like that, but attempting filter or result on that gave "undefined" back so I guess it wasn't able to select it like that. I'll try with the table now, see if that works
[11:08:44] <BillCriswell> Niels_: http://jsbin.com/oquvoz/2/edit
[11:09:33] <BillCriswell> json-smith: Where is this area at that adds the element?
[11:10:06] <json-smith> did you see the pastebin link ?
[11:10:15] <BillCriswell> json-smith: Yes.
[11:10:31] <json-smith> The prepend is in the callback
[11:10:50] <BillCriswell> json-smith: On the page you linked me too. Where can I see what's going on?
[11:12:21] <json-smith> BillCriswell: let me put an alert in for the two column heights and then I'll get you to first visit and then refresh the page
[11:12:24] <sojic> Hey folks... I've just started using jquery mobile... and faced with problem... I have "fixed panel" with menu. I want to generate menu items dynaicaly, but dynamically added <li> does not have "look" as it should.
[11:15:39] <json-smith> BillCriswell: try that link again now. First visit for me was alerting 956, and on the 3rd page refresh showed 1043
[11:16:37] <sojic> Anybody?
[11:16:43] <json-smith> BillCriswell: on the lower value you can definitely see the overflow into the footer - like I say it's Internet Explorer contained
[11:17:57] <Zerhackos> hi, jquerymobile scrolls onload 1 pixel down
[11:18:09] <BillCriswell> json-smith: I'm getting all different numbers when I reload. It seems to me like it's just trying to get the width before images are fully loaded.
[11:18:24] <nick07> I use the fotorame slider, now I want to use it with thumnails, but I'm not able to add the html5 <video> tag to it's gallery, is there any workaround?
[11:18:33] <Zerhackos> ive tried to scroll up 1 pixel after page show, but on pageinit or pageshow
[11:18:33] <Zerhackos>         $.mobile.silentScroll(0); wont work. Someone has an idea?
[11:18:33] <nick07> *fotorama
[11:19:14] <Zerhackos> (if used via console, it worked exactly after the second time i execute the command)
[11:19:18] <Niels_> BillCriswell: Got it - Awesome, thanks :)
[11:19:33] <BillCriswell> Niels_: Awesome.
[11:21:05] <json-smith> BillCriswell: are there any utilities for posting screen shots ?
[11:21:27] <BillCriswell> json-smith: Not sure. Don't do it too often.
[11:21:38] <guy> every time I need to create a closure limited to a specific part of the page, I use $.fn.each. Is there a better tool for the job?
[11:22:08] <guy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ceca8cd73acba1f47bac
[11:22:23] <guy> e.g. this separates out authentication and forgot password logic
[11:23:12] <json-smith> BillCriswell: Do you see the overflow issue ? If not I guess you may struggle to help without a visual perception of the problem
[11:25:44] <BillCriswell> json-smith: Don
[11:25:54] <BillCriswell> Don't have the time to really contribute too much help right now sadly.
[11:25:55] <nick07> I dont know how to add <video> tag with a slider? anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/cNePY/2/
[11:27:31] <json-smith> BillCriswell: Thanks for trying anyway - good luck with the rest of the guys - looks like you've had a few successes even while I've been on (I'll get there eventually !)
[11:27:46] <BillCriswell> Definitely will!
[11:28:10] <nick07> or, how to get the <video> tag with in a <a> to get it to work?
[11:29:01] <duch_kazatel> nick07 why would you wrap a video tag in an anchor?
[11:29:38] <guy> anyone?
[11:31:10] <nick07> http://fotorama.io/customize/video/
[11:31:14] <naeluh> I am having a heck of a time getting this to remove class when the condition is met can anyone see what is wrong http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/RTj3s/
[11:31:52] <naeluh> it will add the class but wont remove it
[11:32:08] <nick07> I want to use my <video> tag as video
[11:32:26] <nick07> like in this example : http://jsfiddle.net/cNePY/2/
[11:32:34] <duch_kazatel> nick07 - that page talks about using a specific lib to do what you want.
[11:33:07] <duch_kazatel> you'd have to injclude that lib and it would take care of everything else.
[11:33:42] <nick07> oh ok, there my knowledges stops..
[11:33:43] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i'm going to lunch.  enjoy all.
[11:35:54] <edmond_2> guys.. any idea why im only able to get the first href link via ajax in this example.. http://jsfiddle.net/AzCgx/1/
[11:36:57] <shahin8r> Can anyone explain why this is not working? http://pastebin.com/XZxgswkk I really can't seem to figure it out!
[11:43:24] <doug65536> shahin8r: use location.href     not document....
[11:44:16] <edmond_2> any help?
[11:44:57] <doug65536> edmond_2: easy: $("#pagination").find("a").first()
[11:45:46] <edmond_2> doug65536:  the problem is that the works only the first time i click a href..
[11:46:18] <edmond_2> doug65536:  the ajax works only on the first click
[11:46:23] <doug65536> edmond_2: oh you mean fetch it with ajax, got it
[11:46:54] <edmond_2> doug65536:  i need to make it work with all the href attr
[11:46:54] <doug65536> edmond_2: you need preventDefault... I'll upd fiddle
[11:47:12] <edmond_2> i did e.preventDefault();
[11:47:17] <doug65536> edmond_2: too late
[11:47:25] <doug65536> you do it way later after ajax completes
[11:47:29] <edmond_2> what do you mean
[11:47:37] <doug65536> put it before $.ajax call
[11:47:43] <doug65536> also, there is no e variable
[11:48:03] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/QtYvZ/1/
[11:48:16] <shahin8r> doug65536: thanks but it didn't do any difference
[11:48:24] <edmond_2> doug65536:  the problem is here $("#pagination a").on("click", function(e){ e.preventDefault();  var href = $(this).attr("href"); console.log($("#propcontainer").load(href)); 			 						});
[11:49:08] <doug65536> edmond_2: you aren't loading jquery
[11:49:11] <doug65536> see top left
[11:49:55] <edmond_2> doug65536:  yes i am
[11:50:37] <doug65536> edmond_2: click isn't being attached to the links
[11:51:04] <edmond_2> you mean here $("#pagination a").on("click", function(e){ ?
[11:51:12] <doug65536> edmond_2: http://jsfiddle.net/QtYvZ/5/
[11:53:21] <doug65536> edmond_2: no I mean first line of script
[11:54:12] <edmond_2> the first line is just doing an ajax search the problem is with the pagination results in the success
[11:54:37] <doug65536> edmond_2: did you look at my fiddle? it works for me
[11:54:54] <doug65536> edmond_2: http://jsfiddle.net/QtYvZ/5/
[11:58:16] <sojic> $.getJSON() is calling 2 times. Any idea why?
[11:58:48] <NoiseEee> sojic: crystal ball is broken today :(
[11:59:01] <sojic> :)
[11:59:23] <sojic> So... what do you need ?
[11:59:49] <sojic> I'll create jsfiddle
[12:00:34] <holywarprofiteer> Hi, quick question, I want to add a class to a div during a click, then remove it when the click is finished. What should I use for that? (also, I'm using v 1.10)
[12:00:59] <ravenzz> why do you need it?
[12:01:28] <holywarprofiteer> is that directed towards me?
[12:01:33] <sojic> Never mind... complicated... I have inline js
[12:02:16] <ravenzz> holywarprofiteer yes sorry
[12:02:36] <holywarprofiteer> I want the look of a button to change when clicked
[12:03:06] <ravenzz> you can do that with css
[12:03:21] <ravenzz> eg a:active { background-color: #f00; }
[12:03:32] <holywarprofiteer> oh cool
[12:03:34] <holywarprofiteer> thanks
[12:03:35] <jnewt> it seems that if i create an object (<a/> in this case) and then add a click handler, it doesn't work.  could this be due to whether or not it has actually been created?
[12:04:16] <sojic> NoiseEee, strange... inline js execute $.getJSON 2 times... I've moved the code in external file, it is OK.
[12:04:37] <jnewt> i had the same function working when the links were static, i'd just put the $("#div") in the .onload, but now that i'm creating them with js, it's not working.
[12:05:11] <NoiseEee> jnewt: code man.
[12:05:15] <NoiseEee> nobody here has ESP
[12:06:17] <BillCriswell> devdocs.io added node.js, aww snap.
[12:06:43] <hamcore> What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong? http://pastebin.com/xdPma7Ds returns Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'on' at the console.
[12:07:40] <NoiseEee> hamcore: generally that jquery hasn't been loaded (yet)
[12:07:50] <NoiseEee> and/or its not a dom element?
[12:07:56] <BillCriswell> hamcore: I assume you're trying to use .on on an object that's not a jQuery object.
[12:08:18] <NoiseEee> hamcore: just wondering why you might think the code you posted is helpful in any way
[12:08:42] <hamcore> NoiseEee, BillCriswell, seems like complete.js was the mistake.
[12:09:05] <hamcore> NoiseEee, BillCriswell thanks!
[12:09:12] <BillCriswell> .... Welcome. I think.
[12:09:37] <filkinsteez> would this be the right way about finding the width of an image with the id imageMap?
[12:09:42] <filkinsteez> var img_width = $('#imageMap'.width());
[12:09:43] <filkinsteez>   console.log(img_width);
[12:09:56] <doug65536> filkinsteez: missing )
[12:09:57] <BillCriswell> filkinsteez: $('#imageMap').width()
[12:10:14] <filkinsteez> thanks!
[12:10:17] <filkinsteez> just noticed that as i hit send haha
[12:10:33] <edmond_2> doug
[12:10:39] <doug65536> edmond_2: yes?
[12:10:39] <edmond_2> doug65536:  look http://jsfiddle.net/p7WsQ/
[12:11:05] <doug65536> edmond_2: ok
[12:11:39] <edmond_2> is only doing the ajax call the first time i click href
[12:13:18] <NoiseEee> not for me, edmond_2 http://jsfiddle.net/p7WsQ/1/
[12:17:53] <edmond_2> cant seem to figured out whats going on
[12:20:09] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: well your alleged problem doesn't exist in the example i fixed for you
[12:20:23] <doug65536> edmond_2: is that your page? is it "busting out" of your page?
[12:20:28] <edmond_2> NoiseEee:  what have u changed?
[12:20:30] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: but your problem hints at JS breaking somewhere / an error somewhere, so no more JS is processed
[12:20:40] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: I just added jquery as a library and made it in the body.
[12:20:51] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ edmond_2
[12:21:05] <jeebster> will calling on() for a jquery collection perform the callback function on each element in the collection?
[12:21:15] <doug65536> edmond_2: tons of errors occur
[12:21:28] <edmond_2> NoiseEee:  actually this code works for me but only the first time i click href
[12:21:33] <edmond_2> then i doesnt load
[12:21:39] <doug65536> edmond_2: $ is not defined is a bad one. you don't load jquery again
[12:21:43] <jeebster> I'm seeing some strange behavior where my callbacks for live() function, but if I switch it to on() nothing happens
[12:22:10] <doug65536> edmond_2: cross domain request is being blocked
[12:22:23] <doug65536> edmond_2: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://www.desarrolloweb.com/. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:22:49] <edmond_2> doug65536: http://www.desarrolloweb.com/ is just a web to test
[12:22:50] <doug65536> edmond_2: http://jsfiddle.net/p7WsQ/
[12:22:54] <NoiseEee> doug65536: but you can see the point is it still gets called.
[12:22:58] <doug65536> edmond_2: well, you can't do that
[12:23:07] <doug65536> it is not allowed by that webserver
[12:23:13] <NoiseEee> doug65536: this is not the issue.
[12:23:26] <doug65536> NoiseEee: look at my fiddle
[12:23:31] <edmond_2> ii dont know how can i fiddle an example like that
[12:23:36] <edmond_2> sorry guys
[12:23:38] <doug65536> NoiseEee: he wasn't loading jquery so whole code did nothing
[12:23:52] <NoiseEee> right which i corrected on my fiddle :P
[12:24:42] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: look, the brief sample you pasted works fine (fires XHR multiple times, not on 'first click only')
[12:24:49] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: so... look elsewhere / http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[12:25:17] <filkinsteez> so im trying to get the width of an image with the id of #imageMap doing this:
[12:25:21] <filkinsteez>   var img = $('#imageMap');
[12:25:21] <filkinsteez>   var img_width = $(this).width();
[12:25:21] <filkinsteez>   console.log(img_width);
[12:25:40] <NoiseEee> filkinsteez: uh, you mean img.width()
[12:25:40] <filkinsteez> but it seems to be logging the width of the browser rather than the image
[12:25:51] <NoiseEee> filkinsteez: why would you possibly be using 'this' in that example?
[12:26:30] <filkinsteez> i checked stackoverflow and it said to use this to find the width of an image
[12:26:44] <filkinsteez> but you can do img.width()
[12:26:45] <filkinsteez> ?
[12:26:46] <NoiseEee> filkinsteez: a javascript/jquery tutorial would be helpful. good luck.
[12:27:00] <doug65536> edmond_2: put links that allow cross domain requests in and this will work http://jsfiddle.net/p7WsQ/4/
[12:27:57] <edmond_2> Fix it
[12:28:06] <doug65536> edmond_2: if that worked, you could redirect a user to a malicious page that .load("banksite.com") and intercept passwords etc
[12:28:30] <edmond_2> i have changed $(document).on("click", "#pagination a", function(e){
[12:28:58] <NoiseEee> doug65536: you realize that nothing that you're commenting on addresses his issue/problem
[12:29:07] <NoiseEee> doug65536: nice to know and all, but totally nothing to do with his issue.
[12:29:24] <doug65536> NoiseEee: dude, it has everything to do with the issue
[12:29:30] <doug65536> NoiseEee: tell me then, what is the issue
[12:29:50] <NoiseEee> in his words? " is only doing the ajax call the first time i click href"
[12:30:34] <NoiseEee> which personally i interpreted as "when i click something the second time, no XHR/ajax request occurs"
[12:30:41] <doug65536> I would explain why he thinks that but I can't be bothered. go ahead NoiseEee, fix it for him
[12:30:42] * NoiseEee shrugs
[12:31:03] <edmond_2> right
[12:31:12] <ObiWlanKenobi> does anyone know jquery image cropper which saves the image to BASE64?!?
[12:31:21] <shahin8r> Sorry for repeating but still haven't solved this one: http://pastebin.com/XZxgswkk anyone know why the first snippet does not get proper position/heights but the second one just work fine?
[12:31:37] <edmond_2> anyways i fix it changing to $(document).on("click", "#pagination a", function(e){
[12:32:41] <NoiseEee> edmond_2: so that suggests you were overwriting the element that had the event handler on it.  so good, carry on.
[12:32:58] <edmond_2> thanks guys
[12:33:08] <doug65536> edmond_2: I told you that a long time ago
[12:33:21] <doug65536> "first line"
[12:33:40] <hamcore> A stupid question: Does jqueryUI includes jQuery?
[12:33:47] <hamcore> Do*

[12:36:10] <Trical> I want to make a very fluent webchat, should I use websockets?
[12:36:27] <NoiseEee> yes.
[12:36:38] <eph3meral> Trical: if you don't care about future compatibility, sure
[12:36:42] <eph3meral> Trical: otherwise use Socket.io
[12:36:59] <Trical> what is the thing that peoplea re using for this...?
[12:37:08] <NoiseEee> Trical: ^^ socket.io really
[12:37:18] <Trical> allright I will check it out
[12:43:06] <anew> i need a jq tooltip plugin that when you hover over an image, it appears as a tooltip - but i also need it to adjust to the dimensions of the browser
[12:43:19] <anew> all the ones i'm finding are if the image is larger then the browser it all just runs outside the browser
[12:43:28] <grafi> oÃ´
[12:46:06] <anew> anyone

[12:46:56] <pskli> shahin8r: let's continue here ;)
[12:47:06] <shahin8r> pskli: alrighty
[12:47:41] <shahin8r> pskli: the offset on load is 2292.2666015625 and the offset when click link (working) is 1506.0166015625
[12:49:11] <pskli> shahin8r: is your code inside a $(document).ready(... func ?
[12:49:21] <shahin8r> pskli: yep!
[12:49:43] <pskli> hmm
[12:49:46] <pskli> no live site to test ?
[12:51:38] <shahin8r> pskli: sorry only localhost. but wait i just realized something
[12:52:10] <shahin8r> pskli: i'm running this  $("#projects, #blog, #contact").css( "min-height", $(window).height() ); on window.load :)
[12:52:50] <pskli> shahin8r: well, I don't see why the min-height would alter the offest().top
[12:53:15] <shahin8r> pskli: you're right it didn't do anything
[12:53:56] <pskli> just to be sure, save your offset().top inside a variable before, and parseInt() it
[12:54:07] <pskli> not sure it'll change something...
[12:54:29] <pskli> and then cook it with a pinch of salt and let it cool down for a minute
[12:55:35] <shahin8r> pskli: haha wtf?
[12:55:47] <pskli> did it change something ?K
[12:56:03] <shahin8r> pskli: nope, just commented out that part and still the same offsets
[12:56:43] <pskli> is #blog the only ID on your page ??
[12:56:55] <shahin8r> yep, triple checked that
[12:57:23] <pskli> and if you directly type in the browser console "$('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: $("#blog").offset().top - navbarheight }, 400);"
[12:57:25] <pskli> does it work ?
[12:57:37] <pskli> or is it still feucte ?
[12:58:34] <shahin8r> pskli: worked like a charm, strange huh :)
[12:58:47] <pskli> hmpm
[12:59:04] <pskli> if you're inside a $(doc).ready function, remove the window load
[12:59:08] <shahin8r> pskli: could it be something that's rendering after page is loaded? like images or something?
[12:59:25] <shahin8r> pskli: same..
[13:00:02] <shahin8r> pskli: uh oh, 3% battery and no charger. i'll hunt you down tomorrow if you're available if my laptop dies.. :)
[13:00:05] <pskli> well that's what I said before, if you have images before your #blog div, they might be still loading when this code is executed
[13:00:20] <pskli> so use something like the imagesLoaded() plugin to be sure
[13:01:11] <pskli> once the images are loaded, the offset().top become wrong
[13:01:28] <pskli> unless you wait for these images to be loade
[13:01:28] <pskli> d
[13:01:38] <shahin8r> pskli: yeah i see. that must be it!
[13:02:08] <shahin8r> pskli: thanks for the help. i'll make sure to host the site next time so you'll get a live check if i can't fix it
[13:02:17] <pskli> ;)
[13:02:19] <pskli> np
[13:02:54] <shahin8r> pskli: shouldn't a settimeout fix that for me?
[13:03:09] <pskli> shahin8r: norrmally it wouuld
[13:03:19] <pskli> but you can't predict the loading time of your images
[13:03:26] <shahin8r> pskli: true.
[13:03:50] <pskli> https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded
[13:03:51] <pskli> try that
[13:03:53] <shahin8r> pskli: ah well, off i go.. now i can atleast get a good night sleep without worrying about that
[13:04:01] <shahin8r> pskli: already got it now ;) thanks alot
[13:04:05] <pskli> np
[13:04:09] <pskli> you won't sleep, it's not fixed
[13:04:14] <pskli> night night
[13:04:15] <pskli> :p

[14:17:17] <Bloomberg> http://img202.imageshack.us/img202/7203/ekb4.jpg
[14:17:42] <Bloomberg> I have that date tabs with jquery tabs*
[14:17:45] <Bloomberg> perfect.
[14:18:20] <Bloomberg> But The result of date is so much, so I need show in that tab only 5 or 7 and paginate the rest
[14:18:24] <Bloomberg> understand me?
[14:19:01] <grafi> and how many tabs do you have oÃ´
[14:19:18] <Bloomberg> more than 50
[14:19:37] <maxmoore14> anybody good with jqm? having a problem refreshing a listview within a popup... http://jsbin.com/omaqit/5/edit
[14:20:21] <smallfoot> I want find an element, then remove all children from it, and add new stuff to it, should I use .empty() and .append() or is there any smarter way?
[14:20:37] <Bloomberg> html()
[14:20:41] <smallfoot> I see
[14:20:42] <smallfoot> thanks
[14:20:42] <maxmoore14> I've tried listview('refresh') but the style aren't reapplying
[14:21:18] <Bloomberg> maxmoore14: Exactly what do you want?
[14:21:33] <Bloomberg> grafi: What do you suggest me?
[14:21:44] <grafi> sounds wonky Bloomberg, i wouldnt even know how that would look ...
[14:21:58] <grafi> what do you imagine would a solution look like?
[14:22:12] <maxmoore14> Bloomberg: if you comment out the line where I remove an item, you will see the bottom corners are rounded
[14:22:53] <maxmoore14> but by dynamically changing the element, I need to call some method to re-apply the styles
[14:22:59] <maxmoore14> just not sure what method to call
[14:23:18] <MarkyC> Bloomberg: Are you creating these tabs using a loop construct? If so, if (i > 5) e.addClass(".initiallyHidden"). That way you can have a 'show more' button, which (possibly adds initiallyHidden to the initially viewable tabs) shows the hidden tabs, or a subset of them
[14:23:33] <sayd> I'd like to have a validation rule that isnt tied to a specific input (its tied to two). how could I do that with the Validate plugiN/
[14:23:47] <Bloomberg> http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9727/dwxl.jpg
[14:24:00] <Bloomberg> That is my complete tabs table
[14:24:13] <Bloomberg> I need to do it like this, is very functionall
[14:24:43] <naeluh> is there any reason why slideUp would not work in chrome but will work in firefox?
[14:26:02] <Bloomberg> http://pastebin.com/98U4k2dM
[14:26:06] <samholmes> How does data work?
[14:26:12] <Bloomberg> That is the script of my table
[14:26:18] <sayd> with the validation plugin, what is the way to create a general validation rule? ie not directly mapped to a field
[14:27:02] <samholmes> It seems like I can't do: $element.data('parent-element', $parentElement).data('items', items); Then later: $('.find-element').data('parent-element').data('items');
[14:27:55] <Bloomberg> MarkyC: did you seen my script?
[14:28:12] <MarkyC> Bloomberg: In your first foreach in that script, keep count of how many you have printed
[14:28:36] <Bloomberg> and then?
[14:29:14] <MarkyC> Bloomberg: after your threshold, add class="initiallyHidden" to (forgive me) either the li or li a
[14:32:54] <MarkyC> initiallyHidden looks like { display: none; }. Then with some jQuery $(".initiallyHidden").filter() (possibly. forgive me, I'm learning) you should be able to show a subset of the matched elements at once
[14:35:23] <Bloomberg> That makes this ::: http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9727/dwxl.jpg
[14:36:00] <MarkyC> Bloomberg: Here's my attempt $(".initiallyHidden").filter( function( index ) { doStuff() } );
[14:36:28] <snkcld> why do i need to manually $("#el").trigger('change') whenever i change an option in that element with .prop('selected', true)?
[14:36:38] <snkcld> should that not automatically trigger 'change' ?
[14:36:56] <snkcld> or am i looking at the change event in a wrong way?
[14:40:53] <iredmedia> Hey everyone. I'm trying to create a jquery element    $('<table>'),     by using append,     ie this.somejQueryObject.append('<table></table>') but i'd like to IMMEDIATELY select the appended item, but any chaining after this point will select the initially selected object.

[14:57:27] <naeluh> can someone please help explain to me why my remove button works in ff but  not in chrome ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/RTj3s/
[14:57:49] <naeluh> its really strnage
[14:58:18] <samholmes> Hi naeluh
[14:58:28] <naeluh> samholmes:
[14:58:31] <naeluh> hello
[14:58:39] <samholmes> naeluh: How do you know whether a variable is jQuery object?
[15:00:12] <samholmes> naeluh: What's your remove button suppose to do?
[15:00:44] <Al1> @naeluh what does that remove button suppose to do?
[15:02:05] <samholmes> naeluh: your code is formatted like shit. :P
[15:04:20] <Al1> @naeluh ah i c, just tested it in FF and i see what it does
[15:05:03] <naeluh> Al1: wrd yeah kinda weird
[15:05:17] <naeluh> samholmes: thanks for the kind words
[15:05:20] <naeluh> haha
[15:05:39] <naeluh> remove is supposed to hide the div
[15:05:58] <samholmes> What div?
[15:06:20] <naeluh> grade_level_set_1
[15:06:30] <naeluh>  $("#grade_level_set_" + _add_more).hide('fast');
[15:06:39] <naeluh> this executes in ff and not in chrome
[15:07:50] <naeluh> its very weird cause .hide() works pretty well any other time Ive used it
[15:08:15] <Al1> hmm yeah, there should be no difference
[15:08:26] <Al1> do you get any errors in console?
[15:11:05] <naeluh> no
[15:14:40] <samholmes> naeluh: Idk what was wrong with your script, but as I was cleaning it up it works: http://jsfiddle.net/RTj3s/4/
[15:15:22] <spikku> i'm looping through an array and doing two ajax checks on each element. However, the second ajax check doesn't run with the correct param. Is there an example somewhere about how to handle this?
[15:15:29] <samholmes> naeluh: Why do you have inline-styles when you clearly could use the separate stylesheet?
[15:15:57] <naeluh> its not my code I am modifying now
[15:16:25] <naeluh> but I will take a look at what you did
[15:16:32] <Krambiorix> how can i format a decimal to european style (100.000,00) ?
[15:17:05] <samholmes> spikku: You're probably doing something within the callback of the ajax request, which is asyncronous, while the loop is synchronous.
[15:17:37] <spikku> i think i get it
[15:17:39] <samholmes> spikku: loop through the array with $.each to create a closure
[15:18:00] <spikku> samholmes, thank you!
[15:18:07] <samholmes> spikku: np
[15:28:43] <JFranks> Well I finally solved the 'click();' without ID problem.. I added a button that adds an ID first, then does the click by ID.. Oh yeah. http://jsbin.com/iqafol/7/edit
[15:30:19] <sayd> is there a way to get the values from an array of jquery elements? $('#foo1, #foo2').val() only returns the first selector match
[15:32:48] <samholmes> JFranks: .click() doesn't accept an ID as parameter though?
[15:33:34] <sayd> if I do $('#foo1, #foo2').map(function() { return $(this).val(); }), the array returned is strange, when i output it in console its show [1,2] but when i inspect it as a passed argument its actually two jquery objects
[15:33:42] <sayd> (inaisw n eeT)
[15:33:44] <naeluh> samholmes: thanks for your help turns out the function name was the issue
[15:33:50] <sayd> (inside an array)
[15:33:55] <naeluh> remove()
[15:34:30] <samholmes> naeluh: ah
[15:34:35] <samholmes> not sure why
[15:35:47] <shoky> sayd:  run .get() on the map result to get a regular array
[15:41:37] <JFranks> samholmes: Hmm? Is that a question? .. I could use jQuery('#foobar').click();  .. I bet.. I didn't try.. the point wasn't that jQuery cannot "click();" the point was that there was no way to pass the click unless you reference the element by ID.. Apparently? ;)
[15:46:13] <JFranks> samholmes: Wow.. nope.. jQuery does not want to click it .. Would be funny if this whole time it was a jQuery issue
[16:05:44] <sayd> shoky ty
[16:16:46] <mobile8> hi, i'm having some weird error, for some reason my page is broken and says jquery offset is not defined (while it is)

[16:22:27] <Erston> hello
[16:26:17] <sayd> anyone have a good function for taking the last two characters of a string?
[16:26:47] <duch_kazatel> and what?
[16:26:54] <duch_kazatel> deleting them?
[16:27:09] <sayd> something like "string".substring(str.length,str.length-3) = "ing"
[16:27:32] <sayd> i just want a right..
[16:28:44] <davesLeep> 'lo, is there a way to get an image's original size ?
[16:29:05] <davesLeep> after it is resized using width="" height=""
[16:29:19] <duch_kazatel> why not store those before it's been resized?
[16:29:55] <davesLeep> because it's generated using php
[16:29:59] <beachandbytes> Ya create data params for real-width on the image onload
[16:30:25] <davesLeep> so i cant, that's cool, i'll just have to go the long way round
[16:30:45] <beachandbytes> you can
[16:30:47] <duch_kazatel> why not attach that info via PHP?
[16:30:55] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, you can, but it's kind of a backwards way to do it.
[16:31:14] <davesLeep> but if it's generated when the page loads beachandbytes from my php script
[16:31:28] <duch_kazatel> beachandbytes?
[16:31:37] <davesLeep> oh wait.. i could just get jquery to grab the url of th eimage surely? then look at the url's image? no?
[16:31:39] <duch_kazatel> oh haha
[16:31:42] <beachandbytes> var t = new Image(); t.src = $(original_image).attr('src');
[16:31:47] <beachandbytes> then do t.width, t.height
[16:31:57] <duch_kazatel> why are you shoving that kind of processing to the client-side?
[16:32:04] <davesLeep> it's an image resizer
[16:32:33] <davesLeep> hrm you just gave me an idea..
[16:33:14] <davesLeep> i could attach it via the php, but the only thing is, it will get pretty ugly , but i think i've got a neat way to do it
[16:33:24] <davesLeep> my code is ugly enough as it is XD
[16:33:45] <davesLeep> cheers beachandbytes, i'll try that first

[16:51:36] <fireboot> Hi everybody
[16:51:49] <fireboot> I have a question about animations using jquery
[16:52:19] <fireboot> basically in the CSS code, I change a value when an element is hovered
[16:52:21] <duch_kazatel> just ask away.
[16:52:44] <fireboot> but I want to animate this transition using jquery
[16:53:05] <fireboot> I found out that i need in my jquery code to "cancel" the css hover handler
[16:53:30] <fireboot> I do this by calling the css() function
[16:53:35] <fireboot> so for example my code is now:
[16:54:15] <duch_kazatel> use a jsfiddle btw.
[16:54:20] <fireboot> http://pastebin.com/7wYYeBmg
[16:54:21] <fireboot> oops
[16:54:24] <fireboot> pastebin isn't ok?
[16:54:33] <duch_kazatel> i can't run code on pastebin ;)
[16:54:53] <fireboot> ok well give me a sec so I can write a trimmed example
[16:54:57] <myhrlin> that's what raw pasts + saving is for :P
[16:55:04] <myhrlin> s/pasts/pastes/
[16:55:13] <fireboot> oh well I don't the code needs to be run; It works fine
[16:55:20] <fireboot> +think
[16:55:26] <fireboot> my question is more about why it works :P
[16:59:07] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/41/ :)
[17:01:02] <tds5016> I'm trying to load zurb's foundation tooltips plugin with require.js, and for some reason it doesn't appear to be working.
[17:01:13] <tds5016> how would I go about tracing where the issue is living?
[17:01:38] <Whirl3d> are you using wp_enqueu_script?
[17:01:53] <tds5016> Whirl3d: was that to me?
[17:01:58] <Whirl3d> sorry, wrong channel.
[17:02:03] <tds5016> no worries :-)
[17:02:51] <Erston> in order to get each nested object must i put a loop in a loop?
[17:02:56] <Erston> i currently have a .each loop
[17:03:34] <Whirl3d> If I cut a piece of string in half is it long enough?
[17:03:43] <Whirl3d> what if I cut it three times?
[17:03:43] <duch_kazatel> inception.
[17:08:33] <fireboot> ok so duch_kazatel
[17:08:37] <fireboot> I wrote a small example
[17:09:40] <fireboot> http://jsfiddle.net/JWq77/
[17:10:22] <fireboot> basically in the JS I need to set back the left property to its original value otherwise the animation does not run
[17:10:48] <Whirl3d> Ernston, it appears to work now, right?
[17:10:52] <fireboot> (because the CSS would immediately set it to its final value)
[17:11:02] <Erston> not on that example i shown
[17:11:08] <duch_kazatel> fireboot sorry, got sidetracked.  i can't help you atm.  sorry
[17:11:09] <Erston> but i am starting to figure something out offline
[17:11:10] <Erston> i think
[17:11:15] <fireboot> ... ok :D
[17:11:17] <fireboot> thanks anyway
[17:11:41] <Erston> Whirl3d do you mean the top ten page? or the gallery ?
[17:11:46] <Erston> i fixed the top ten problem :)
[17:11:48] <Whirl3d> fireboot, gimme a second to ready what you typed.
[17:11:57] <fireboot> thanks
[17:11:57] <Whirl3d> Ernston, the top ten!
[17:12:08] <fireboot> I haven't yet asked my question
[17:12:26] <Erston> yeah :D
[17:12:29] <Whirl3d> okay, ask now that I looked
[17:12:30] <fireboot> my question is: why do I need to do a call to css() in the first lambda, but not in the second?
[17:12:46] <Erston> think i fixed my gallery issue too :)
[17:12:57] <Whirl3d> first lambda?
[17:13:14] <fireboot> the first anonymous function I pass to the hover() function
[17:13:28] <Whirl3d> try it without it.
[17:13:40] <Whirl3d> there's a chance it'll scoot across the page.
[17:13:53] <fireboot> yes I know; it doesn't work. the CSS sets it immediately to its final value
[17:13:57] <fireboot> so the animation is not run
[17:14:01] <fireboot> (but the image is moved)
[17:14:18] <Whirl3d> so, remove the css
[17:14:32] <fireboot> no, I can't. It should work if JS is not enabled
[17:14:44] <fireboot> but everything works just fine here Whirl3d
[17:14:49] <fireboot> I'm just wondering why basically ;D
[17:15:27] <Whirl3d> Because the image's css is set to 100px on hover.
[17:15:35] <Whirl3d> THEN jquery sets it to zero to animate it
[17:15:46] <Whirl3d> you just don't see it because jquery is fast
[17:15:47] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:15:51] <fireboot> yes, but
[17:15:56] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/47/
[17:16:12] <fireboot> my question is about this line:         $(this).animate({left: "0px"}, 1000);
[17:16:12] <Erston> could anyone pls tell me why this is not working on jsfiddle but is working offline ?
[17:16:19] <fireboot> that's the code that is triggered on blur
[17:16:21] <Erston> am i missing something obvious
[17:16:29] <fireboot> why don't I need to add another call to css() in this line?
[17:16:35] <fireboot> why does it works fine this way?
[17:16:42] <fireboot> (I mean, the animation works)
[17:17:00] <Whirl3d> because the hover state is refreshed, but the "up" state isn't.
[17:17:04] <alexr2> Erston, are you running a server locally or are you just going to those files directly?
[17:17:23] <Whirl3d> In other words, when you hover, the pseudo-class actively applies the css to the element
[17:17:39] <alexr2> err rather, it is working on jsfiddle?  what's not working about it?
[17:17:42] <alexr2> i misread your question
[17:17:42] <Erston> ermm
[17:17:44] <Whirl3d> but when you blur, there is no :blur pseudo-class so it doesn't know to reapply directly
[17:18:01] <Erston> on my local server i can access the imgs
[17:18:08] <fireboot> but in pure css, when you blur, the property is set to its original value
[17:18:09] <fireboot> isn't it?
[17:18:16] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/49/  is the latest
[17:18:21] <Erston> the gallery page does not even load :s
[17:18:21] <obert> this is an active chan..
[17:18:31] <Whirl3d> fireboot, not if something else changed it
[17:18:44] <fireboot> oh really?
[17:18:47] <fireboot> I didn't know
[17:20:08] <Whirl3d> Perhaps #CSS could explain it better, but think if you wanted to add another class to it for some reason then when you blurred, you would want the new class position, right? How would it know without re-rendering the page?
[17:20:57] <fireboot> hmm I didn't understand what you just said
[17:21:07] <Whirl3d> see if you remove the css from the fiddle, it stays at 100 because we animated it there
[17:21:16] <Whirl3d> so now the hover doesn't appear to do anything.
[17:21:53] <Whirl3d> have you considered using css animations? It's better than jquery for things like this.
[17:22:30] <fireboot> well that's the thing, I am already using CSS animations
[17:22:44] <fireboot> my code is supposed to be able to use whatever feature is available
[17:22:55] <fireboot> if CSS3 animations are available then I should use them
[17:23:01] <fireboot> otherwise I should fallback to jquery animations
[17:23:12] <alexr2> Erston, you don't have an element in the html side of things with an id of photogallery
[17:23:19] <fireboot> and if both JS and CSS3 are not available then it must work fine with just pure CSS2
[17:23:22] <alexr2> You have them for topten and for search, but nothing for photogallery
[17:23:25] <alexr2> that's why it doesn't change pages
[17:23:36] <fireboot> but I understand what you mean now
[17:23:48] <fireboot> I actually thought about it and came up with another answer
[17:23:50] <Erston> 1sec let me check
[17:23:55] <fireboot> my wild guess was that
[17:24:03] <fireboot> jquery applies the property directly into the tag
[17:24:04] <Erston> omg
[17:24:10] <Erston> thanks for pointing that out
[17:24:14] <alexr2> You're welcome
[17:24:19] <Erston> i dont believe my stupidity at times
[17:24:20] <fireboot> (by adding a "style="..."" in the tag I mean)
[17:24:24] <Erston> i thought i did that yesterday :s
[17:24:31] <fireboot> and that this has priority over the CSS file
[17:24:47] <Whirl3d> have you considered using modernizer?
[17:25:35] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/54/
[17:25:44] <fireboot> so when the page is loaded, nothing happens, but once jquery runs the animation once, then it adds the style information into the tag and then it will always have priority over the css file, so that's why on blur the css doesn't put automatically the property to its original value
[17:25:51] <fireboot> not sure if I'm clear :P
[17:25:51] <Erston> thanks again
[17:25:59] <alexr2> No worries
[17:26:04] <Erston> does this happen to you guys?
[17:26:12] <fireboot> yeah I'm using modernizr already
[17:26:15] <alexr2> Happens to everyone
[17:26:28] <Erston> how can i learn jquery and js
[17:26:33] <fireboot> but I still need my JS to "cancel" the effect of the :hover pseudo class
[17:26:34] <Erston> if i cant even remember to add the bloody html
[17:26:38] <fireboot> modernizr doesn't help me for this
[17:26:46] <Erston> no wonder am finding jquery tricky in parts
[17:27:16] <tw2113> Erston, you use it, figure out its nuances and whatnot
[17:27:44] <fireboot> Erston: actually I find jquery pretty easy; Almost all the troubles I had came from tricky things in CSS
[17:27:47] <fireboot> not in jquery
[17:28:15] <v0lksman_> if I change teh val() of something does it not fire the .change() event?
[17:28:50] <myhrlin> fireboot: you have tried http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/?
[17:29:07] <myhrlin> +modernizr to add CSS3 stuff
[17:29:10] <fireboot> yeah I'm already using them
[17:29:13] <myhrlin> oh ok
[17:29:25] <fireboot> as said I don't really have any problem, I was actually just wondering why my code works :D
[17:29:32] <myhrlin> oh
[17:31:27] <fireboot> oops
[17:31:28] <Technodrome> anyone here worked on any pjax, how do you deal with multiple content areas?
[17:32:46] <duch_kazatel> "multiple content areas"?
[17:33:07] <duch_kazatel> pjax is meant to replace the contents of basically the entire page and load the next one using ajax so it "feels" snappier.
[17:33:16] <TheHackOps> Hey, I have a jQuery search function. For some reason javascript hates me and never does anything. When the user types in a search term is should start eliminating things inside specific css classes how ever it does absolutely nothing. http://vcelink.com/subject/46
[17:33:41] <TheHackOps> I have put the script inside the header for testing purposes and included the jquery library as the first thing that loads in
[17:33:53] <TheHackOps> The text box is just there for testing
[17:34:10] <TheHackOps> This http://jsfiddle.net/ztaz6/1/ is how it should work
[17:35:46] <Whirl3d> that fiddle doesn't seem to work right.
[17:36:14] <Whirl3d> If I type M james is the only remaining option
[17:36:26] <TheHackOps> .contains
[17:36:41] <TheHackOps> if it contains something relevant then it remains
[17:36:52] <TheHackOps> Thats the wrong fiddle i pasted sorry
[17:36:53] <Whirl3d> Matthew isn't relavent
[17:37:01] <Whirl3d> relevant. lol
[17:37:27] <peepsalot> what is the proper way to get the mouse event location relative to your element (canvas in this case)?
[17:38:09] <TheHackOps> http://jsfiddle.net/Mottie/ztaz6/2/
[17:38:13] <TheHackOps> THat is the fiddle
[17:38:24] <TheHackOps> Just adds case conversion
[17:38:50] <TheHackOps> Anyway that works the way i want it to (Not my jQuery) but when i put it into my website it does nothing
[17:39:55] <duch_kazatel> TheHackOps - did you just straight-up add that code to your side?
[17:39:57] <duch_kazatel> *site?
[17:41:03] <TheHackOps> duch_kazatel: Well i included jquery and stuff
[17:41:10] <TheHackOps> and modified the selectors
[17:41:21] <TheHackOps> but i dont think i understand how jquery selectors work
[17:41:34] <TheHackOps> because that seems to be the difference in the code
[17:41:43] <TheHackOps> would be down the line selectors
[17:43:44] <TheHackOps> duch_kazatel: If you view source on the website i linked above you can see the implementation
[17:43:55] <TheHackOps> its just for testing
[17:44:31] <Whirl3d> you have to wrap you code in $(function () { code here });
[17:44:39] <Whirl3d> otherwise it runs before you have any content to select
[17:45:24] <Whirl3d> by the time you add your html body element, the script is run and found nothing to work with so it stops.
[17:47:49] <TheHackOps> BOOYAH
[17:47:52] <TheHackOps> Got it working
[17:47:56] <TheHackOps> <3
[18:12:51] <Erston> just noticed a problem
[18:12:55] <Erston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/55/
[18:13:09] <Erston> if the json.shops.shopImgs  only has one object
[18:13:24] <Erston> the gallery will not load, i have been trying to adjust the while(t < s)
[18:13:31] <Erston> but am not having much succes
[18:13:36] <Erston> any ideas ?
[18:17:18] <Whirl3d> line number to start looking?
[18:18:45] <Erston> 6
[18:19:01] <Erston> 3, 5 & 6
[18:19:07] <Erston> is where am at
[18:21:04] <Krambiorix> how can i make 1000.00 + 10.01 to 1010,01  (mind the comma!)
[18:21:13] <Whirl3d> Ernston, where do you load a .gallery element?
[18:21:41] <Erston> line 7
[18:23:39] <Whirl3d> you select it on line 7, where is it in your markup?
[18:24:15] <Whirl3d> $(".gallery") will only work if you have a <div class='gallery'> somewhere. I didn't see it, but aybe it's there.
[18:24:49] <Erston> line 35 in html
[18:24:52] <Erston> i append the ul
[18:24:54] <Erston> .gallery
[18:26:40] <Erston> am a moron
[18:27:12] <Erston> i had a [i] instead of [t]
[18:39:45] <doug65536> Erston: why isn't that a for loop
[18:40:11] <doug65536> erston: for (var t = 0; t < s; ++t)
[18:48:14] <initself> trying to get a jQuery UI menu to work
[18:48:16] <initself> http://jsfiddle.net/e7WtX/1/
[18:48:31] <initself> my fiddle works just fine, but the same code shows an <li> list and doesn't hide them
[18:48:37] <initself> on my server
[18:48:41] <initself> can't figure out wtf
[18:49:45] <initself> all the css markup is getting added to it per firebug
[18:49:54] <initself> it doesn't turn into a menu, tho.
[18:50:24] <Erston> arr i think i had a similiar problem
[18:50:39] <Erston> what i did was inspect the html output of jsfiddle that works
[18:50:46] <Erston> paste that into txt editor
[18:50:52] <Erston> and compare it against your local output
[18:51:02] <Erston> you may find an extra class or element is missing
[18:51:47] <initself> i pasted what's in the fiddle right from firebug
[18:52:56] <Erston> try
[18:53:03] <rfk> What is an appropriate way to add a handler to the submission of every form? I am using $('form').submit(function () { ... return false; }); but the form submits normally
[18:53:12] <Erston> changing role="listbox to role="menu
[18:53:59] <Erston> if that does not work
[18:54:02] <Erston> i have another idea
[18:54:32] <initself> i dont even have any roles!
[18:54:45] <initself> $("#premium_menu").menu();
[18:54:48] <Erston> on the ul
[18:54:50] <Erston> in the html
[18:54:51] <initself> you mean configure more ...
[18:54:57] * initself tries.
[18:55:11] <initself> wait
[18:55:14] <Erston> i think the html is the issue
[18:55:18] <initself> that came from jQueryUI tho
[18:55:28] <Erston> try changing it to menu
[18:55:51] <Erston> on your local
[18:57:11] <initself> didn't seem to do anything...
[18:57:17] <Erston> now try
[18:57:31] <Erston> on every <li
[18:57:36] <Erston> add role="menuitem"
[18:58:18] <initself> no change
[18:58:19] <Erston> am confused and how it can work in jsfiddle but not your local, if its exactly the sam
[18:58:22] <Erston> :s
[18:58:25] <initself> Erston: me too
[18:58:32] <initself> i'm gonna setup a test case from scratch
[18:58:41] <Erston> same version of jquery mobile?
[18:59:21] <Erston> what browser you testing on?
[18:59:43] <Erston> is your popup blocker allowing the page?
[18:59:52] <Erston> i found it blocks local pages for me :s
[19:03:26] <initself> firefox, no blocks
[19:03:45] <initself> i have a working menu on another tab of the same code
[19:05:38] <Erston> am assuming you have the .css and .js attached
[19:06:02] <initself> ya, like i said, the styles are being applied
[19:06:10] <initself> it's just not doing anything that resembles a menu!
[19:06:27] <Erston> but jsfiddle is fine :S
[19:06:33] <initself> yes
[19:06:38] <Erston> tried a different version of jquery
[19:06:44] <Erston> or url
[19:09:29] <initself> ya, my test case page is donig the same thing
[19:09:35] * initself tries another jquery version.
[19:10:30] <rfk> What is an appropriate way to add a handler to the submission of every form? I am using $('form').submit(function () { ... return false; }); but the form submits normally
[19:10:54] <rfk> (Might be worth noting that I am submitting the form with $('#formid').submit()
[19:11:56] <initself> 1.8.3 does the same thing.....
[19:13:26] <Erston> anyone ever used photoswipe plugin ?
[19:13:36] <Erston> i use 2.0 on jsfiddle
[19:13:47] <Whirl3d> $(*form').on('submit', function (e) { e.preventDefault();return false;});
[19:14:19] <initself> Erston: got it
[19:14:24] <initself> it was jQuery UI
[19:14:29] <initself> older version i guess....
[19:14:41] <initself> crap, i dont know what upgrading is going to do to my whole site!
[19:14:48] <rfk> Whirl3d: No dice. Interestingly, I just get [] when I do it from the console. Is it not finding any forms ?
[19:14:56] <Erston> woo
[19:15:01] <initself> Erston++
[19:15:10] <Erston> i actually helped someone
[19:15:12] <Whirl3d> from the console on your site?
[19:15:16] <rfk> yep
[19:15:23] <rfk> In the browser
[19:15:36] <Whirl3d> Just wanted to make sure you didn't mean at jsfiddle.
[19:16:11] <Whirl3d> how are you submitting the form? If you have a submit button, capture the button event and preventdefault
[19:16:13] <rfk> It's odd, since the form is submittable via $('#form').submit(), but does not seem to be accepting the subimssion handler
[19:17:02] <rfk> I have a button, but it actually just calls a function that submits it. I'm using the Bootbox plugin, which constructs Bootstrap modals
[19:17:13] <Whirl3d> rewrite the form submit attribute to be something like null and store it in a variable. Do you validation then call it.
[19:17:59] <Whirl3d> but if you can prevent the button from doing it's thing by capture the click event on the button, you prevent it from submitting
[19:19:40] <rfk> OK, the button calls a function that I wrote, and i'm just calling $('form').submit()  -- shouldn't that call the submission handler ?
[19:20:22] <rfk> What do you mean by rewriting the form submit attribute?
[19:21:07] <doug65536> rfk: just call preventDefault on the event in the submit handler callback
[19:21:40] <rfk> Ah, the thing is my submit handler isn't being called -- just the button callback, configured by Bootbox
[19:21:42] <doug65536> rfk: $("#my_form").on('submit', function(ev) { ev.preventDefault(); ...etc... });
[19:22:06] <rfk> The button callback calls $('#form').submit();, but the submit handler isn't called
[19:22:27] <doug65536> rfk: can you make a fiddle?
[19:22:56] <doug65536> rfk: or just dump the relevant code into a pastebin
[19:22:57] <rfk> Should hit the bed
[19:23:13] <doug65536> rfk: does the submit happen?
[19:23:34] <rfk> Yeah, it adds the keys to the URL query
[19:24:38] <doug65536> rfk: it should call the submit handler, I'll confirm in jsfiddle
[19:24:48] <rfk> yeah, it should :(
[19:25:11] <doug65536> rfk: I think a real bug is making you think it doesn't
[19:27:34] <rfk> Well, I run $('form').on('submit', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); });
[19:27:36] <rfk> in the browser console
[19:27:40] <rfk> And a form is submitted
[19:27:45] <rfk> reloading the page, etc
[19:28:01] <doug65536> is it the only form?
[19:28:05] <rfk> Yeah
[19:28:06] <doug65536> or do you mean #form
[19:28:17] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/nFzZd/2/
[19:28:37] <rfk> Well, I was doing 'form' just because in my actual code I apply a generic submission handler to all forms to 'ajaxify' them
[19:28:49] <rfk> Thanks i'll check that
[19:29:33] <doug65536> rfk: works for me http://jsfiddle.net/nFzZd/3/
[19:29:59] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/nFzZd/5/
[19:30:38] <rfk> Yeah. I must be doing something silly then i guess. Thanks for the help
[19:30:47] <doug65536> rfk: np
[19:42:48] <grafi> if just did rightclick -> edit on a html file ... now words is popping up O_o
[19:42:51] <grafi> *I
[19:50:08] <whitenoise> hey guys
[19:50:25] <whitenoise> in this: http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/ -- why is the black block not sliding to the left of the box before the other two boxes appear?
[19:51:07] <whitenoise> i'm trying to accomplish an effect where element 1 fades in on the right, slides to the left, element 2 fades in on the right, slides to the left against element 1, and then element 3 simply fades in
[19:53:10] <newbert> I have a toggle going on and I'd like the series of links I'm using to only show one div at a time instead of stacking all the div on top, needing the users to click to collapse it. The site is: http://nolabyg.com/c/gatorhunt.html
[19:54:07] <Snerf> whitenoise, sounds complicated.. do it 1 step at a time.. instead of all at once
[19:54:16] <Whirl3d> whitenoise, use .delay(time)
[19:55:07] <whitenoise> Whirl3d: could you toss in an example in my code and send a new Save my way? I'm not sure what to put the .delay on
[19:58:27] <whitenoise> Snerf: I commented out the other two fade ins...I have just yet to get an animate to perform on moving a block across the #container
[20:02:17] <whitenoise> Whirl3d: here's my try with a delay, still doesn't do the animation... http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/1/
[20:04:02] <Whirl3d> I swear, I can't get jsfiddle to run well for anything anymore. It looks like crap and operates only about half the time!
[20:04:50] <whitenoise> it's almost like it's just not recognizing "left"
[20:07:32] <whitenoise> Whirl3d: is it possible this is a shortcoming in jsfiddle?
[20:08:15] <doug65536> whitenoise: what's supposed to happen?
[20:08:34] <whitenoise> doug65536: let me get you latest, one moment.
[20:09:06] <whitenoise> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/3/ -- clicking the blue box...black box should fade in, and then slide to the left of the container div
[20:11:36] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/4/
[20:12:00] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/5/
[20:12:17] <doug65536> without position: relative, the left is ignored
[20:12:37] <doug65536> whitenoise: http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/5/
[20:12:50] <whitenoise> ahhh
[20:13:00] <whitenoise> so just a shortcoming in my understanding of CSS, which is not surprising.
[20:13:23] <doug65536> whitenoise: https://twitter.com/cackhanded/status/358721135677935616
[20:13:23] <b-ot> doug65536: @cackhanded: The four stages of CSS:  1. I donât know CSS. 2. I know enough CSS to get by. 3. I _know_ CSS. 4. Fuck CSS.
[20:13:51] <whitenoise> doug65536: I'm somewhere between 1 and 2
[20:14:23] <whitenoise> i'm primarily a backend person...server admin...app architect, that sort of deal...i'm trying to learn CSS and stuff :)
[20:14:57] <doug65536> whitenoise: web standards are a total disaster
[20:17:36] <zivester> is there a function in jquery to throttle the amount of times an event is fired?  $('element').on('scroll') is firing too many times in firefox... I'd like it to be like chrome, and just fire once on each 'scroll'
[20:18:15] <doug65536> zivester: I remember hearing about a plugin that does that
[20:18:24] <doug65536> zivester: can you show your scroll handler?
[20:19:32] <zivester> that's literally it... $('#mydiv').on('scroll', function(){ doSomething(); })
[20:19:57] <doug65536> lol, ok, what does doSomething do? I might see some perf bugs
[20:20:45] <doug65536> zivester: that right there tells me that you don't precalculate anything and you lookup in the dom excessively
[20:21:23] <zivester> its animating an absolutely positioned div with a speed of 100ms, so that it "slides" down the page with the scrolled content
[20:21:49] <doug65536> zivester: why not use .animate then
[20:21:50] <zivester> so yes, when firefox fires this ~30 times per scroll, its animating it too many times... where chrome only fires once and it's not a performance issue
[20:21:56] <zivester> i am using animate ;)
[20:22:36] <Whirl3d> zivester, yes there is a throttle, but I don't remember how to make it work. Gimme a minute
[20:23:05] <Whirl3d> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[20:23:12] <doug65536> zivester: capture a flag variable and clear it at the end of the animate
[20:23:31] <doug65536> zivester: if flag true, don't start another animate
[20:23:41] <doug65536> zivester: every update, update a desired position
[20:23:49] <doug65536> s/update/scroll event/
[20:26:35] <zivester> yah, that'll work.. was hoping there was something in jquery to do it... spoiled by underscore
[20:26:48] <Whirl3d> try $.deferred();
[20:27:10] <doug65536> zivester: I'll try to come up with a fiddle
[20:31:31] <Whirl3d> zivester, it might be easiest to create a function that simulates animate based on the difference between scroll pos and the element's top.
[20:34:27] <zivester> its cool, I'm creating a poor mans throttle.. I think it'll do
[20:35:39] <doug65536> zivester: almost works http://jsfiddle.net/r7YQf/1/
[20:40:17] <raj> how how can I pass data to the .done() function of ajax?
[20:40:27] <doug65536> raj: a closure
[20:42:24] <doug65536> raj: would need to see code snippet to be more specific than that
[20:52:14] <Keavon> I am thoroughly confused and having a total "WTF?" reaction on my site http://www.keavon.com/. I'm using jQuery's load() to load a .php page in a div. In that .php file is an <img> tag. This is loaded over the div #contact. Yet the image doesn't show up there: instead, it replaces the image on the div #keavon.
[20:52:27] <doug65536> zivester: http://jsfiddle.net/r7YQf/18/
[20:53:15] <whitenoise> doug65536: almost there.... http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/7/ -- for whatever reason block3 is being stupid
[20:53:29] <doug65536> zivester: still bug there :|
[20:55:27] <Whirl3d> doug65536, doesn't work in firefox at all
[20:55:52] <Keavon> is this a bug in jQuery?
[20:56:04] <Keavon> I can't think of anything else that could explain it
[20:56:05] <Whirl3d> yes, I am certain.
[20:56:33] <Keavon> Whirl3d: are you referring to my site's problem?
[20:57:39] <doug65536> whitenoise: http://jsfiddle.net/Pvu32/8/
[20:58:02] <Whirl3d> Keavon, have you looked at the devconsole? There are tons of errors.
[20:58:09] <Keavon> Ah, I have not
[20:58:11] <whitenoise> doug65536: more CSS trouble, it looks like
[20:58:43] <doug65536> whitenoise: position: absolute is actually relative to its parent if the parent is positioned
[20:58:56] <Whirl3d> Just as a point of interest, it's always best to troubleshoot problems before assuming that Jquery has a bug in it and you are the first person to find it.
[20:59:00] <whitenoise> doug65536: and thus left/right still work
[20:59:19] <doug65536> whitenoise: yes. does my fiddle do what you needed?
[20:59:25] <Keavon> These warnings, with the exception of the bottom two, seem to be CSS problems
[20:59:26] <whitenoise> doug65536: yep! thanks.
[21:00:12] <Whirl3d> You must not have the same results that I have....I see binding errors and port errors
[21:01:15] <raj> doug65536, http://paste.ofcode.org/tYUq7J72LgXpsVGkrEk5py
[21:01:31] <raj> I wanna get ahold of the user data
[21:01:52] <Keavon> Whirl3d: Maybe I'm opening the wrong dev console. Are you using Firefox?
[21:02:29] <doug65536> raj: your comment is wrong, you can access user_input there
[21:03:32] <raj> I can't
[21:03:42] <doug65536> raj: tell me why you can't
[21:03:48] <raj> it's not there
[21:04:34] <Whirl3d> Keavon, I'm using CoolNovo (a chrome hack)
[21:04:38] <doug65536> raj: you're doing it the hard way you know
[21:04:43] <Keavon> hmm
[21:05:03] <doug65536> raj: where is the code that attaches the event callback
[21:05:06] <Keavon> Whirl3d: This is all I see http://puu.sh/3VJ0l.png
[21:05:16] <raj> it's a button push
[21:05:45] <doug65536> raj: that's irrelevant
[21:05:55] <doug65536> raj: where is the code that attaches the click handler
[21:06:09] <Keavon> There's also this error console which gives me this: http://puu.sh/3VJ34.png
[21:06:32] <raj> it's in the same file
[21:06:33] <raj> why?
[21:06:38] <crivera> how do you add a click to everything but input fields?
[21:06:40] <doug65536> raj: trust me, you're doing it wrong
[21:06:43] <crivera> click event*
[21:06:45] <crivera> handler
[21:06:54] <raj> doug65536, ok, so how should I be doing it?
[21:07:00] <crivera> $("body").not("input").click() doesn't work for me
[21:08:02] <doug65536> raj: I'll show you a fiddle
[21:08:08] <raj> crivera $('body').find('*')
[21:08:20] <raj> k, thank you sir
[21:08:53] <Keavon> ok I'm stupid that was from all the sites I was visiting
[21:09:11] <Keavon> THIS is the only thing in my error console http://puu.sh/3VJ9v.png
[21:09:28] <Es0teric> question -- why is the return value of the function "undefined" instead of the count from data.count ? http://pastebin.com/z3EYLFEm
[21:10:09] <crivera> raj: wouldn't * match input fields as well?
[21:10:22] <raj> yes
[21:10:28] <raj> you need to still put the .not() at the end of that
[21:10:56] <raj> $('body *').not('input') might also work
[21:11:04] <Keavon> and I saw the error
[21:11:06] <Keavon> and I fixed it
[21:11:22] <crivera> thanks
[21:11:45] <Keavon> but it's still randomly replacing the totally unrelated image with the image in a file called by load()
[21:12:10] <raj> welcome
[21:12:44] <Es0teric> question -- why is the return value of the function "undefined" instead of the count from data.count ? http://pastebin.com/z3EYLFEm
[21:15:00] <Keavon> I can't think of any reason why it would cause such an obscure behavior than a bug in jQ
[21:15:54] <Keavon> Whirl3d: Did my changes fix the errors you were seeing?
[21:16:02] <doug65536> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/79P8m/2/
[21:16:14] <snover> Es0teric: read the documentation on the async property.
[21:16:23] <snover> âAs of jQuery 1.8, the use of async: false with jqXHR ($.Deferred) is deprecated; you must use the success/error/complete callback options instead of the corresponding methods of the jqXHR object such as jqXHR.done() or the deprecated jqXHR.success().â
[21:16:32] <snover> no wait
[21:16:40] <snover> youâre still doing that.
[21:16:43] <snover> ok, new tact
[21:16:46] <snover> quit being dumb
[21:16:50] <snover> donât use sync xhr
[21:17:00] <Keavon> wait, it's not replacing the image, it's covering over it
[21:17:14] <Es0teric> snover ok but how do i pass data from the $.ajax into the function's scope?
[21:17:21] <snover> you donât.
[21:17:24] <snover> ?ajax101 @ Es0teric
[21:17:24] <b-ot> Es0teric: Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://oi41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.jpgÂ and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[21:17:52] <doug65536> raj: hold on, sorry, bug
[21:18:28] <Keavon> ok new question: should a page loaded with load() have a title? a head?
[21:21:34] <Es0teric> snover so you mean to tell me i have to pass a function into success: in order to grab the data?
[21:21:41] <Es0teric> a function declared outside $.ajax
[21:22:39] <snover> no, you just have to `return $.ajax(â¦)`. then getResultCount(url).then(function (data) { do stuff with data; })
[21:22:43] <Keavon> ok I figured out that it's not jQ's fault
[21:22:45] <snover> works
[21:22:54] <snover> welcome to promises
[21:26:25] <raj> doug65536, the eventhandling function needs to be separate and named
[21:26:41] <doug65536> raj: why
[21:26:46] <raj> also, .done() instead of a success key
[21:26:55] <raj> cuz it is re-used
[21:27:45] <Es0teric> snover but i want the function to return the value inside of itself
[21:27:54] <snover> too bad
[21:28:04] <snover> thatâs not how asynchronous programming works :)
[21:28:52] <doug65536> raj: if you showed me enough code to know what you're doing, I could help. I'm done guessing.
[21:29:11] <Es0teric> snover i still dont get it
[21:29:36] <raj> doug65536, I showed you enough code to know that I'm using a named function and .done() for the callback
[21:30:27] <doug65536> raj: write a function that captures a value and returns a closure. make the callback call the closure and your closure will have the saved data
[21:37:04] <doug65536> raj:  http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/1/
[21:37:51] <doug65536> raj: you can add whatever parameters for data that you need to remember for the callback. put your shared function in the returned function's body
[21:38:53] <doug65536> raj: works without 'new' too http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/2/
[21:39:15] <doug65536> raj: make sense?
[21:39:54] <doug65536> raj: in your case you'd want to remember user input or something? I can't tell from your code
[21:40:47] <doug65536> raj: if the closure is for done event, then add parameters to the returned function for result, status, etc
[21:41:37] <doug65536> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/3/
[21:42:28] <doug65536> raj: http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/4/
[21:42:40] <doug65536> that's what I meant when I said make a closure
[21:43:02] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/5/
[21:45:02] <raj> I already have that, essentially
[21:45:14] <raj> you're just saying to define the variable outside of the ajax functions
[21:45:15] <raj> which I did
[21:45:29] <doug65536> raj: no that's not what I'm saying
[21:45:48] <raj> oh, no, I see
[21:45:55] <raj> you're saying to make a function that'll get me that data
[21:45:58] <raj> that's crazy
[21:46:09] <doug65536> no that isn't what happens
[21:46:13] <raj> I can't believe this is the only way to pass data
[21:46:29] <doug65536> it's a great efficient way - it is a great feature of the language
[21:46:33] <doug65536> there is no 'call' to get data
[21:46:49] <raj> it's messy
[21:47:09] <doug65536> raj: you're one of those guys that ask for help with something, then argue about solutions
[21:47:30] <doug65536> you're the one insisting on having a separate function
[21:47:49] <doug65536> do you understand what happens?
[21:48:17] <doug65536> when js creates the function, it captures access to the parameters, then the function itself is assigned as the event callback
[21:48:38] <doug65536> but that function captured access to the parameters to event_closure and can access them later
[21:49:16] <doug65536> so when the event fires, it calls straight into the 'returned' function, but that function keeps the parameters it was passed alive
[21:49:25] <doug65536> the parameters create_closure was passed
[21:50:35] <doug65536> you could create 1000 different callbacks with event_closure, and the returned functions would retain whatever parameters were passed to create_closure
[21:52:01] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/FyxTE/6/
[21:52:55] <doug65536> raj: the "clean" way is to have the function right there in the ajax call, then the data are captured automatically
[21:53:09] <doug65536> ...there in the same functiuon as the ajax call
[21:53:40] <raj> very clever trick
[21:53:46] <raj> but it's hacky
[21:53:51] <raj> so it's sad that it's the standard
[21:53:56] <doug65536> it's the language we have
[21:54:02] <raj> :)
[21:54:17] <doug65536> it's an extremely cool part of the language though
[21:54:21] <yankov> any nicer alternatives for accordeon? for when you need to have a long list of expandable/collapsable items
[21:54:23] <doug65536> without it callbacks are a pain
[21:54:49] <doug65536> raj: Lua has it so I'm very comfortable with it (I knew Lua before js)
[21:59:24] <aro> i needs advice
[21:59:40] <aro> we have a navigation bar at the top of our page, which is allowed to scroll out of view
[21:59:55] <aro> once it is scrolled out of view, we would like to display a fixed one in its place
[22:00:00] <aro> (a smaller more compact version)
[22:00:07] <aro> what is the best way to do that?
[22:00:52] <doug65536> aro: attach a scroll callback to the document, put a position:fixed div there, in scroll callback, .show() or .hide() appropriately dependent on $(document).scrollTop()
[22:02:08] <aro> where do i put the fixed div?
[22:02:15] <aro> thats the one that binds to the top yes
[22:02:25] <doug65536> aro: I'll make a fiddle...
[22:02:29] <aro> ok
[22:02:30] <aro> :)
[22:09:19] <doug65536> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/MmnjB/5/
[22:10:28] <doug65536> aro: added performance optimization http://jsfiddle.net/MmnjB/7/
[22:10:52] <doug65536> and a bug! 1 sec
[22:11:32] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/MmnjB/8/
[22:11:43] <aro> okay
[22:11:56] <doug65536> removed console.log http://jsfiddle.net/MmnjB/9/
[22:12:17] <aro> okay, what would i do if the menu was a variable height?
[22:12:25] <aro> and there is an offset to the top of the page
[22:12:33] <doug65536> wouldn't matter
[22:12:37] <doug65536> just habit
[22:13:10] <doug65536> I forced some height so it wouldn't be a stupid little line :)
[22:13:38] <aro> would i need to dynamically assign the scroll_pos
[22:13:41] <aro> erm
[22:13:42] <aro> the 75
[22:13:59] <doug65536> yes pick how far down they scroll before little fixed menu appears
[22:14:10] <doug65536> I picked 75 pixels for demo
[22:14:28] <aro> ok
[22:14:39] <aro> is there a way to calculate the bottom of an element?
[22:14:47] <aro> ill use that offset in place of the 75
[22:14:47] <doug65536> want me to make it dynamically when real menu is offscreen?
[22:15:11] <aro> i should be okay, as long as i can calculate that bottom point
[22:16:13] <doug65536> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/MmnjB/10/
[22:17:20] <aro> sweet
[22:19:26] <aro> o snap
[22:19:27] <aro> it works
[22:19:29] <aro> thanks :)
[22:19:33] <doug65536> aro: np
