[00:50:54] <ldl> hi, friends.
[00:51:00] <ldl> can you take a look at this?
[00:51:00] <ldl> https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/62746/my-jquery-ajax-request-post-data-in-php-backend-can-not-get
[01:17:04] <Woet> ldl: it was removed, so no.
[07:04:33] <weijunli> Im trying to use jquery to directly control the url bar, but im not able to  navigate to the url because it is a new browser session without history. Heres my code and error https://dpaste.de/KTJA - There is any way I can still use this feature but on a session without `history`?
[07:04:39] <weijunli> thykka, r u around
[07:05:37] <Cork> weijunli: that's just push state
[07:05:57] <weijunli> Cork, theres a solution for this?
[07:06:14] <Cork> you can push any state as long as it is the same domain
[07:06:32] <weijunli> so file:/// doesnt work
[07:06:34] <Cork> push state doesn't reload the page so nothing except the same domain is allowed
[07:06:43] <Cork> ya, it is for websites
[07:06:57] <Cork> file:// is a 90% dead legacy from the 90's
[07:07:10] <weijunli> i need to load offline websites and it must be from file:///
[07:07:20] <Cork> no it doesn't have to be
[07:07:28] <weijunli> for my case, yes
[07:07:28] <Cork> just start a small local webserver
[07:07:41] <Cork> there are plenty of tiny servers on the market
[07:08:03] <Cork> (ex you can create one with 4 lines of go code)
[07:08:23] <Cork> file won't let you do most anything
[07:09:01] <Cork> file:// is left available in browsers to allow loading help html files from cds and the like, not for fully working websites
[07:09:14] <weijunli> for my specific case it must be from file:///, this is mainly for android devices. The user will fetch some .html from my website and then once downloaded it must open from file:///
[07:09:25] <Cork> ok, then your stuck with the url you get
[07:10:28] <weijunli> someone referred this link to me  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=301210
[07:10:54] <Cork> "WontFix" <--
[07:10:54] <weijunli> can you get a solution from the comments? im not that experienced with jquery so couldnt fully understand if theres a workaround
[07:11:09] <Cork> what you want to do has security consiquenses, so browser won't allow you
[07:11:42] <Cork> if you want full control, as far as web are allowed, start a webserver
[07:40:06] <Cork> weijunli: it isn't a jquery limitation
[07:40:27] <Cork> your trying to change a url part that isn't safe to let third party change, so you can't
[07:45:59] <Uhkis> all that sounds like you're using completely wrong tools for the job
[08:20:19] <weijunli> Uhkis, hmm not really
[09:01:02] <Phruis> whats the best way to handle selectors that may or may not exist?
[09:11:01] <Cork> Phruis: jquery does that by default, so as long as you call them correctly, you don't
[09:15:56] <Phruis> Cork, let me elaborate then, when I do $('#thing') if it doesn't existing in the DOM it gives me an error
[09:16:10] <Phruis> should I check for its existence some way as a matter of habit?
[09:16:13] <Cork> then your not using jquery
[09:16:37] <Cork> $('selector') NEVER thorws, unless the query string can'
[09:16:42] <Cork> *'t be parsed
[09:17:05] <Cork> it just returns an empty result object
[09:18:16] <Phruis> ok
[09:22:32] <Phruis> Cork, thanks for setting me straight on that
[11:00:44] <alturic> Hello. This might be a really basic question, but if I had an array with keys like "firstAmount", "secondAmount", "thirdAmount", how would I determine which amount was the highest? I'm going to be iterating over each of these to output some html, and I'd like to "highlight" the highest amount.
[11:03:22] <royalty> if you're going to iterate you might as well store the key with the highest via comparison
[11:06:47] <alturic> Ahh, so just keep doing a comparison currentHighest > currentAmount if it's false push the currentAmount to the currentHighest.
[11:14:49] <royalty> yeah why not
[11:20:01] <alturic> Err wait. I'm not iterating in the sense of how my words construed. I am iterating, but each iteration contains a "firstAmount", "secondAmount", "thirdAmount". I'm looking to find the highest amount in each iteration, not across all iterations.
[11:21:24] <royalty> oh
[11:21:57] <royalty> the logic is still similar though I suppose, it's even easier now though
[11:22:37] <royalty> you can use Math.max
[11:23:38] <royalty> but you'd need to keep track of the key... so maybe you can't use that
[11:23:56] <royalty> unless the key isn't important, and knowing the highest value is all you need?
[11:24:54] <alturic> Right, so it's a $.each(data, function (k, v) { //each iteration has a firstAmount, secondAmount, thirdAmount }, I'm looking to find the highest value from each iteration.
[11:25:26] <alturic> Ugh, possible word confusion again. I'm not caring what the first iterations max amount was when it's doing the second iteration... just the max amount for the specific iteration it's on.
[11:25:59] <alturic> I think I can just push the values to an array and do a math.max on it or something similiar. o.O
[11:26:03] <royalty> Math.max(v.firstAmount, v.secondAmount, v.thirdAmount);
[11:27:05] <royalty> data[k]['maxAmount'] = Math.max(v.firstAmount, v.secondAmount, v.thirdAmount)
[11:27:13] <royalty> lol
[15:35:37] <naftilos76> Hi, when i do : $("#branch_background_id_2").data() i get: Object { level: 0, element_id: "background_id_2" } but when i do: $("[data-element_id=background_id_2]"); i get .length == 0 . What am i doing wrong?
[15:36:40] <robertmaxrees> .data() reads from an object, not attributes.
[15:37:07] <robertmaxrees> what does your markup look like?
[15:38:37] <robertmaxrees> naftilos76 also: are you assigning that value using .data()?
[15:38:45] <naftilos76> yes i am
[15:38:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's why.
[15:38:58] <naftilos76> what am i missing?
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't touch any attributes when writing.
[15:39:13] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() to find the element instead.
[15:40:53] <naftilos76> i have to assign data-element_id = some_val during html assembly right? i mean for searching in the way i did
[15:41:10] <naftilos76> robertmaxrees: ?
[15:41:16] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean by "html assembly"
[15:41:36] <robertmaxrees> either way, regardless of how you're constructing the markup, do something like this instead: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/sf5bzpwr/
[15:41:48] <naftilos76> i get it no problem thanks
[15:42:10] <naftilos76> it has to be in the html tag itself
[15:42:13] <robertmaxrees> that way you can be consistent and use .data(), instead of waffling around with incosistencies.
[15:42:18] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:42:37] <robertmaxrees> if you're assigning using .data(), just use .filter().  selecting on data attribute values is fragile.
[15:44:20] <naftilos76> ok thanks
[16:44:37] <linux_daemon> hello guys, i have this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/0sv8g6fr/4/ if i remove the text from the href, and click, it will open the image in the modal, but if it is as it is now, it will not open the image. cant figure out where the problem is
[16:45:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:46:09] <linux_daemon> http://jsfiddle.net/0sv8g6fr/6/ this one, is working fine, click on the image
[16:46:55] <linux_daemon> the previous fiddle, when i do the images size 0, and move the listener on href instead on image, the image will not show
[16:46:56] <robertmaxrees> ah, why does the modal launch when there's no text in the anchor but doesn't when there is?
[16:47:08] <robertmaxrees> *anchor, not href fwiw
[16:47:37] <linux_daemon> yes, anchor. and yes, that is the issue
[16:48:27] <linux_daemon> any idea on what am i doing incorrectly in the first fiddle?
[16:48:31] <robertmaxrees> looking.
[16:49:09] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - doing $('#myModal').on('show.bs.modal', function() { in that click handler is going to cause you headaches since that's going to bind a new handler each time .img is clicked.
[16:49:13] <robertmaxrees> so it'll run multiple times.
[16:49:43] <codi> I've got a list of links in a div. Two links have a class of heading added to them. I want to wrap each heading with the links that follow in a div. Basically i need to turn a single column list of links into two, broken where the heading links are placed.
[16:50:14] <robertmaxrees> codi gotta fiddle?
[16:50:28] <linux_daemon> how can i solve this?
[16:50:46] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon my guess is that it's because you're setting the width and height to 0 for the images.
[16:50:57] <robertmaxrees> and that it has nothing to do with the text.
[16:51:07] <linux_daemon> hmm, let me try
[16:51:12] <codi> @robertmaxrees: https://codepen.io/codilechasseur/pen/bGbPrBw
[16:51:52] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon if memory serves bootstrap has ways to handle this built-in.
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> codi gonna start with the obvious - any reason you're not able to just render this correctly from the start?
[16:52:50] <codi> Squarespace
[16:53:01] <linux_daemon> if i inspect it, it says (for the image src) src=unknown
[16:53:11] <linux_daemon> src=(unknown) , sorry
[16:54:42] <robertmaxrees> codi gross.  either way, you'd need to do something like .each() over all of them figure out the "start" and "end" indexes, then .append() those collections to a new div.
[16:54:46] <robertmaxrees> a few ways to appreciate it.
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> *approach it
[16:55:25] <robertmaxrees> though i'll note that you're not technically supposed to put a div inside a span.
[16:56:07] <codi> client is desperate for a "mega menu". this is why i told them to not use squarespace
[16:56:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:57:13] <codi> i tried the insertBefore and checking the index of a .each, but i keep getting a closed </div> after i insert an opening div
[16:57:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because you can't just insert part of an element.
[16:57:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery inserts the whole thing.
[16:57:42] <robertmaxrees> hence the strategy with appending things instead.
[17:00:33] <linux_daemon> no ideas :@
[17:00:58] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon what happens in you set the image heights and widths to something other than 0?
[17:01:17] <linux_daemon> it will show next to the text
[17:01:28] <robertmaxrees> does the modal work though?
[17:01:37] <linux_daemon> with the anchors, no
[17:01:47] <linux_daemon> if i have text in the anchor, no
[17:01:51] <linux_daemon> otherwise yes
[17:02:19] <linux_daemon> if i put the <img between <a> and </a>, with no text, then yes
[17:02:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up ##bootstrap since this is really an issue with that :)
[17:02:22] <linux_daemon> it will work
[17:03:24] <linux_daemon> shoot
[17:03:26] <linux_daemon> found it
[17:03:51] <linux_daemon> forgot to move the data-target and data-toggle on the anchor
[17:03:59] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:05:50] <linux_daemon> thanks robertmaxrees
[17:06:30] <robertmaxrees> sure :)
[17:38:04] <codi> i thought maybe wrapAll would do it
[17:38:13] <codi> combined with a nextUntil
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> could try that, too.
[17:40:22] <codi> can't seem to get it to work
[17:40:53] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the codepen you've got?
[17:41:10] <codi> https://codepen.io/codilechasseur/pen/bGbPrBw
[17:42:35] <codi> skips the first header item, then puts all links into the div, leaving the second header out
[17:43:00] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're selecting the wrong thing.
[17:43:02] <robertmaxrees> to start with.
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> and becuase you have multiple groups you want to work with it'll be a little more involved than that anyway
[17:46:18] <robertmaxrees> also that codepen has a random span that isn't closed.
[17:48:15] <codi> ok cool, thanks!
