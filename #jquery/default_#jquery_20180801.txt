[04:03:28] <giddorah> Hey everyone, I'm trying to make a local front-end for a service (using html/jquery) but I've run into CORS-problems. What would you do if you had to make ajax-calls to an online API from a locally hosted html-file?
[04:04:01] <giddorah> The online api is 100% trusted and the front-end will never be used by anyone but me so I'm not concerned about security at all.

[06:09:12] <RavinduL> Hi!
[06:09:46] <RavinduL> In the 2nd snippet of code at this question: https://stackoverflow.com/a/6927257 they've used e = e || window.event to support IE
[06:10:45] <RavinduL> Does jQuery do this when accessing e.originalEvent in the handler in .on("keypress", (e) => { /* here? */ }) ?

[07:33:23] <BrainWork> hi, has anyone else experienced strange compatibility issues with microsoft edge and jquery?
[07:34:10] <BrainWork> e.g. serializing forms being 'wrong' in strange ways, parts of the field names appended to the end of or half way through values?
[07:34:21] <BrainWork> personally ive not had the patience, and just blocked edge from our portal
[07:35:12] <BrainWork> e.g. theres a field named compliance, which is a select tag, and it has two option values, Yes and No. when its serialized in edge its value becomes Nopliance :/
[07:35:17] <BrainWork> or Yesliance
[07:36:47] <BrainWork> https://pastebin.com/9EhT1iZn
[07:36:53] <BrainWork> thats the code that breaks in edge
[07:37:27] <BrainWork> jquery 2.1.4, probably old by now
[07:39:56] <BrainWork> what makes it more annoying is i dont even have edge to test this, i develop on linux...
[07:42:06] <MikeD_> what difference does it make what you develop in/on/etc?  if safari/iphone/ios users have problems, we can't say "i use windows, you go to hell"  (unless you can, then you do)
[07:46:00] <BrainWork> if its edge users, i *can* say go to hell :)
[07:46:35] <BrainWork> its a questionnaire page for our suppliers. we pay THEM money, and they must comply with our supplier compliance questionnaire, so we have the advantage. not to mention only like 3% of users use edge
[07:46:41] <BrainWork> but, i still want to get to the bottom of it and fix it
[07:50:33] <BrainWork> i did narrow it down to the seralizeArray method, i pass in a form expecting yes/no string values n the value members, and i get back corruption instead, im thinking a browser bug

[12:29:48] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:30:05] <taplar> all day
[12:30:42] <ZeroWalker> hi, can i make a function go on a button click, not sure if i would link it directly with the button (if that works) of if i listen for the click event or something
[12:31:05] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker you'd use .on() http://api.jquery.com/on/ :)
[12:35:20] <ZeroWalker> hmm, very new to this, so, would this be like $("id name").on(function() { alert("hi"); });  ?
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> "id name" doesn't make sense but that's the basic gist, yeah
[12:35:51] <ZeroWalker> cause i can't get htat to work, and not kinda hard to debug for me
[12:36:01] <ZeroWalker> well i meant, the id="thing"
[12:36:03] <ZeroWalker> then i type
[12:36:08] <ZeroWalker> $("thing")
[12:36:12] <robertmaxrees> #thing
[12:36:19] <ZeroWalker> ah
[12:36:24] <taplar> just like css
[12:36:26] <robertmaxrees> like in CSS
[12:36:27] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[12:36:46] <ZeroWalker> yeah cause i do know css ;)
[12:36:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:37:07] <ZeroWalker> i don't was trying to be sarcastic but failed
[12:37:13] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[12:37:16] <ZeroWalker> :(
[12:37:19] <robertmaxrees> long story short, #id .class
[12:37:34] <robertmaxrees> tagnames don't have anything
[12:37:58] <ZeroWalker> not sure what you meant there, you mean that the access for #id is the same as .class in CSS?
[12:38:32] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:38:40] <robertmaxrees> i mean to select via ID, you use a # in front of the value.
[12:38:44] <robertmaxrees> #foo
[12:38:57] <robertmaxrees> to select by claass, you use a . in front of it - .bar
[12:39:11] <ZeroWalker> ah okay
[12:39:12] <robertmaxrees> if you want to select by tagname, you just use the tagname by itself.
[12:39:15] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Simple_selectors
[12:39:17] <robertmaxrees> div span p etc
[12:39:24] <ZeroWalker> seem straightforward enough
[12:48:24] <ZeroWalker> hmm, if i use a <Input type="file">, wouldn't i checck for on("change"... ?
[12:48:38] <ZeroWalker> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file
[12:48:45] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[12:48:47] <ZeroWalker> thinking of the events
[12:48:57] <robertmaxrees> when do you want the handler to fire?
[12:49:03] <ZeroWalker> cause change doesn't get detected at all
[12:49:11] <robertmaxrees> sure it doe :)
[12:49:13] <robertmaxrees> *does
[12:49:21] <robertmaxrees> it'll fire once the input loses focus.
[12:49:59] <ZeroWalker> then i am doing it wrong, nto sure whne i want it to fire yet, kinda playing around for now
[12:50:17] <robertmaxrees> are you dynamically creating the input?
[12:50:59] <ZeroWalker> okay got it to run, problem was another event thing was overriding it i guess
[12:51:07] <robertmaxrees> "overriding"?
[12:51:38] <ZeroWalker> had another listener that used the form, which i guess is the parent or something for the controls? and was waiting for "submit"
[12:52:04] <ZeroWalker> if i removed the form and the listener it worked and detected my other listener for the "file" button
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:52:16] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't make a difference.
[12:52:40] <ZeroWalker> oh.. weird must check again
[12:53:43] <ZeroWalker> hmm, doesn't seem to work with it, probably something obvious though as i basically just copied it before and modified stuff
[12:53:51] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[12:54:32] <ZeroWalker> here: http://paste.awesom.eu/kywL&ln
[12:54:37] <ZeroWalker> or wait
[12:54:43] <ZeroWalker> okay phew it's fine
[12:55:30] <ZeroWalker> i don't quite get why the form is used, can't you just use the submit directly to do the work?
[12:55:33] <robertmaxrees> submit handler is broken fwiw
[12:56:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why it's causing problems.
[12:56:26] <ZeroWalker> yeah know the post is broken according to chrome, but tried reading up on it but didn't get what the issue was, messed around with it a ton;s
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:56:45] <robertmaxrees> { $('#search') }
[12:56:48] <robertmaxrees> this isn't vlaid.
[12:56:48] <ZeroWalker> ah, so it's just breaking up the rest cause it it, thought it was separate
[12:57:07] <ZeroWalker> oh wirhgt it's not an id
[12:57:11] <ZeroWalker> right*
[12:57:13] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:57:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:57:17] <ZeroWalker> or?
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> it's invalid JS.
[12:57:27] <ZeroWalker> oh
[12:57:27] <robertmaxrees> that's why it's breaking.
[12:57:47] <ZeroWalker> think it was something similar originally, guess it wasn't lol
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> {} is an object - it expects key: value pairs
[12:58:11] <ZeroWalker> wait, as in?
[12:58:21] <robertmaxrees> { foo: 'bar' }
[12:58:21] <ZeroWalker> i thought you just gave it the value
[12:58:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:58:37] <ZeroWalker> or right wait, i had the x: stuff before
[12:58:57] <robertmaxrees> x: $('foo') doesn't make sense.
[12:58:59] <ZeroWalker> but it actually worked when i removed it, guess it just luckily produced the result i expected
[12:59:07] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:59:08] <ZeroWalker> but
[12:59:13] <robertmaxrees> if it functioned, it was likely cached.
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> because that's invalid.
[13:00:12] <ZeroWalker> hmm guess so, doesn't make sense though as i reloaded and it went from failing to working to failing etc, but could just be some messed up cache thing anyhow
[13:00:21] <ZeroWalker> but why is that illegal, cause
[13:00:29] <ZeroWalker> x = the index right?
[13:00:36] <ZeroWalker> key yeah, but you get it
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:00:41] <ZeroWalker> then after that you give it a value
[13:00:43] <robertmaxrees> not the index.
[13:00:48] <robertmaxrees> keyname.
[13:00:56] <ZeroWalker> .POST["name"] like that right?
[13:01:04] <ZeroWalker> hope i wrote that right
[13:01:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:01:07] <ZeroWalker> damn it
[13:01:18] <ZeroWalker> $_POST
[13:01:21] <ZeroWalker> that's it
[13:01:23] <robertmaxrees> that's PHP.
[13:01:25] <robertmaxrees> not JS
[13:01:43] <ZeroWalker> oh, yeah well i sent it to php, sorry
[13:01:51] <ZeroWalker> but the idea is the same in js i guess, maybe?
[13:01:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:02:07] <ZeroWalker> how do you access the post in js?
[13:02:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:02:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to pass a valid object in place of { $('#search') }
[13:02:49] <robertmaxrees> one way to do that is to serialize that.
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> $('#search').serializeArray()
[13:03:21] <ZeroWalker> yeah well i mean like, don't you do something like. Variable = POST["name"] to retrieve it?
[13:03:34] <robertmaxrees> dunno about the PHP side.
[13:03:42] <robertmaxrees> but you're not "retrieving" in on the JS side.
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to create the object.
[13:03:51] <ZeroWalker> ah okay thought you meant that js also could retrieve it, my bad
[13:04:12] <ZeroWalker> ah i thought it could send a variable directly or something
[13:04:25] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing to retrieve in this case since you're making the post body.
[13:04:40] <robertmaxrees> and JS and PHP don't coexist - they communicate using basically text.
[13:05:50] <ZeroWalker> ah, so that's why you need some fancy stuff to send and then deserialize it?
[13:06:27] <robertmaxrees> from the JS side you're just packaging it into an object - JSON is a popular format because just about everything supports it.
[13:06:53] <ZeroWalker> heard it, seen the format i guess, but never quite got what or how it works.
[13:07:10] <ZeroWalker> Is it basically just telling how many bytes and order and some other info?
[13:07:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:07:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> JSON is short for "JavaScript Object Notation"
[13:07:27] <robertmaxrees> the browser takes care of 90% of the work.
[13:07:30] <ZeroWalker> oh
[13:07:33] <robertmaxrees> you just gotta create the data object.
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> the post body
[13:08:48] <ZeroWalker> and that's the {x: thing.serialize} right?
[13:08:59] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:09:44] <ZeroWalker> hmm, but how would php even understand that, or does the browser see that, it's a string for example, and then fix it in a way so php knows it's a string
[13:10:01] <robertmaxrees> you would need to then parse the JSON on the PHP side.
[13:10:09] <ZeroWalker> ah okay that make sense
[13:10:18] <ZeroWalker> as i thought there wasn't any handling in between from what you said before
[13:10:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:36] <ZeroWalker> as in, what you said make sense
[13:10:41] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[13:10:47] <ZeroWalker> :)
[13:52:17] <ZeroWalker> hmm, okay i don't seem to get how it gets the keyname, trying to look up examples, and it just seems it gets it from the serialized data if it contains id=x, but that's can't be it as it seems very confusing if you just have to assume it will grab the id name without you actually telling it so, so must be missing something
[13:52:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:52:52] <robertmaxrees> you talking about serializeArray() ?
[13:53:38] <ZeroWalker> that's part of it, basically the post body
[13:53:49] <ZeroWalker> first you say where to send the post right?
[13:53:50] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[13:53:58] <robertmaxrees> so confused lol
[13:54:10] <taplar> are you aware of how normal form submits work?
[13:54:45] <ZeroWalker> don't think so, from looking at it it seems it's two parts, the submit and the form
[13:54:57] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:55:00] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[13:55:05] <taplar> right, but how does the form know what key/values to submit?
[13:55:32] <taplar> $_POST['me'] has to come from some where
[13:56:13] <ZeroWalker> yeah that's the part i don't really understand, i am looking at it. I am guessing it either takes the id of the submit or the form
[13:56:31] <taplar> your form is composed of various input fields
[13:56:33] <ZeroWalker> but it could take it from some other input i guess, which seems weird to me
[13:56:40] <taplar> each one of those has a name
[13:56:49] <ZeroWalker> yeah
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> ZeroWalker the inputs need to have name attributes.
[13:56:59] <robertmaxrees> that's how you identify each input in the post body.
[13:57:28] <ZeroWalker> oh wait so the it basically takes the entire thing, all inputs?
[13:57:35] <taplar> in the form, yes
[13:57:42] <taplar> so long as they have a name and are not disabled
[13:57:44] <ZeroWalker> ah okay that makes things a bit more clear
[13:57:49] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[13:58:07] <ZeroWalker> one has a name for me, so i am hoping only that one is used
[13:58:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:58:35] <ZeroWalker> only one of my input fields has a name given to it
[13:58:38] <taplar> now i'm confused
[13:58:57] <robertmaxrees> and you only want that one input?
[13:59:01] <ZeroWalker> yes
[13:59:12] <taplar> why does the other one exist then?
[13:59:13] <robertmaxrees> so read the docs I just shared.
[13:59:21] <robertmaxrees> but also what taplar is asking.
[13:59:42] <ZeroWalker> don't ask, it's a mess right now from all mangling around lol, so just think i got 1 input field i guess
[13:59:48] <ZeroWalker> will do
[14:00:14] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oagy8mbs/6/ this is the basic gist.
[14:01:08] <ZeroWalker> hmm
[14:01:20] <ZeroWalker> okay so it works if i use the "$(this).serializeToArray()"
[14:01:25] <robertmaxrees> gyg
[14:01:27] <robertmaxrees> *huh?>
[14:01:33] <robertmaxrees> it's serializeArray()
[14:01:40] <ZeroWalker> sry wrote it
[14:01:50] <ZeroWalker> but that one yah
[14:02:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to learn the basics of jquery?
[14:02:32] <ZeroWalker> i thought i wanted to just send it the data i wanted ot use, so i gave it the input field i wanted directly and serialized that and whatnot
[14:02:41] <ZeroWalker> yeah
[14:02:48] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[14:02:51] <robertmaxrees> this is a great place to start
[14:04:10] <ZeroWalker> or well php as well, it's just that i kinda need jquery for some of the work i am wanting to be able to do. At least i think i need it (if i understand it correctly it's basically makes you do async requests to the server) and that's king:)
[14:04:13] <ZeroWalker> ah will check
[14:04:27] <ZeroWalker> neat bookmarking that one
[14:04:35] <robertmaxrees> jquery does a lot omore than that, and you don't have to use jquery at all.
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> it can make some of that stuff easier, though.
[14:05:22] <ZeroWalker> yeah know it's just a part of it. And as it's a library i am assuming you can just as well manually do the async stuff, but i guess it's a lot messier
[14:05:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:05:55] <ZeroWalker> i would personally like it to be in html itself, but that isn't i thing i think?
[14:06:09] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:06:19] <robertmaxrees> like *what* to be in html itself?
[14:06:34] <ZeroWalker> the submit data wait for answer kinda thing
[14:06:51] <robertmaxrees> you mean ajax?  or just submit the form period?
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> 'cause you can submit forms and send the users to wherever after.  just requires a pageload.
[14:08:00] <ZeroWalker> i guess ajax, if that's the thing that dynamically does the process and can give the user some status during the progress?
[14:08:12] <robertmaxrees> hjeh
[14:08:15] <robertmaxrees> *heh
[14:08:37] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost?
[14:10:37] <ZeroWalker> well i solved the post thing, find it a bit confusing though when you specify the data, but hopefully that becomes clear as i learn how it works overall. Now i need to check some other stuff and use that link you gave me and hopefully learn stuff;P
[14:12:16] <robertmaxrees> what's confusing about it?
[14:16:04] <ZeroWalker> hmm maybe it's not as confusing when i made a change as i noticed i was accessing the data wrong lol
[14:16:44] <ZeroWalker> seems to work as i thought it was supposed to first, but got confused when i broke it -_-,
[14:18:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:20:04] <ZeroWalker> when trying to get the type="file" path using .val(), i get some "fakepath" thing instead
[14:20:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:20:20] <ZeroWalker> is that some security thing or am i accessing it wrong
[14:20:49] <ZeroWalker> 	<input type="file" id="fileUpload"> $("#fileUpload").val()
[14:21:13] <ZeroWalker> used within the "change" event
[14:21:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oagy8mbs/10/
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to make a test case.
[14:23:52] <ZeroWalker> https://jsfiddle.net/oagy8mbs/12/
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> woah so
[14:24:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use jsfiddle :)
[14:24:23] <ZeroWalker> oh wait
[14:24:27] <ZeroWalker> script goes in the bottom?
[14:24:28] <robertmaxrees> sec
[14:24:33] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.,
[14:24:43] <ZeroWalker> ty
[14:25:33] <robertmaxrees> https://davidwalsh.name/fakepath
[14:25:45] <robertmaxrees> and also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/oagy8mbs/14/
[14:35:19] <ZeroWalker> ah you could really trim it down
[14:35:56] <ZeroWalker> i see was expecting it was something like that
[15:12:05] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[15:21:55] <ceramicskull> robermaxrees heya
[15:22:15] <robertmaxrees> hello
[15:22:48] <ceramicskull> I hope I'm not bothering, but I have some javascript, not jquery that I need help with if you don't mind? :(
[15:23:09] <robertmaxrees> i mean, there's an entire ##javascript, but feel free to pop your questing here.
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> *question
[15:23:38] <ceramicskull> I asked in there but no response assuming my question is a little newbie
[15:24:04] <robertmaxrees> so what's the question?
[15:24:24] <ceramicskull> http://jsfiddle.net/jwgL2mx5/25/ - so in my original code, ScrollY doesn't work because the window doesn't scroll, it's a div, so I'm using div.scrollTop to get the value of the scroll.
[15:24:46] <ceramicskull> However, I can't seem to get the remove class to work
[15:25:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:25:27] <robertmaxrees> it's working here.
[15:26:07] <ceramicskull> thats becasue scrolly works
[15:26:26] <ceramicskull> let me see if I can g et it to the exact sandbox
[15:26:36] <robertmaxrees> ....
[15:26:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:27:03] <robertmaxrees> ProTip™: if you're gonna ask for help, link to the broken version/.
[15:28:05] <ceramicskull> It's hard to link a broken version becasue scrollY works fine in jsfiddle :(
[15:28:25] <ceramicskull> My scrollY doesn't work in page because I'm not scrolling with the window, rather an overflow:scroll;
[15:28:48] <robertmaxrees> erm/.
[15:28:58] <robertmaxrees> so why not replicate that in the fiddle?
[15:29:18] <ceramicskull> trying but scrollY seems to work no matter what lol
[15:29:44] <robertmaxrees> super confused but OK....
[15:30:43] <ceramicskull> WOW
[15:30:44] <ceramicskull> nevermind
[15:30:47] <ceramicskull> I found out what it was
[15:30:49] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:31:12] <ceramicskull> had the wrong class in the wrong place.
[15:31:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:31:20] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[15:31:21] <ceramicskull> Thanks for making me fix it in the fiddle, that helped
[15:31:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:32:19] <robertmaxrees> that's half the reason we ask for the fiddle.
[15:32:47] <taplar> i'm just a fan of the opera
[15:35:48] <robertmaxrees> ooooh taplar
[15:36:46] <taplar> orchestra, whatever
[15:36:49] <robertmaxrees> hahahahahahaha
[15:54:33] <ceramicskull> have you used the brave browser?
[15:54:38] <ceramicskull> and thoughts on it?
[15:54:50] <taplar> too skerd
[15:55:12] <taplar> never heard of it
[15:55:24] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's a thing.
[15:55:45] <robertmaxrees> since i'm a developer i tend to avoid using browsers that aren't mainstream.
[15:55:56] <ceramicskull> https://brave.com/ - made by Brendan Eich
[15:56:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[15:56:16] <robertmaxrees> aware of who's apart of the projec.t
[15:56:23] <taplar> yeaaaah, i'm not going to pay to surf
[15:56:36] <ceramicskull> you dont pay, they pay you
[15:56:36] <robertmaxrees> though it's not made by brendan eich.  he's apart of the copany.
[15:56:37] <ceramicskull> lol
[15:56:38] <robertmaxrees> *company.
[15:57:04] <ceramicskull> Yea, sorry, that's what I meant
[15:57:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm also very torn on the concept overall.
[15:57:59] <taplar> *shrug* i'll stick with my ad blockers for now
[15:58:27] <ceramicskull> I just dislike the fact the logo looks like workfront haha
[15:58:58] <ceramicskull> I don't really use it, but I have it
[15:59:16] <ceramicskull> I mostly use FF, Chrome and Safari anyways
[16:12:59] <how2hack> hi, i'm getting an error in console, can someone tell me where's the problem? https://www.hastebin.com/pocejaqoho.js thanks
[16:16:18] <how2hack> also is that a bad approach to what i'm trying to do? i mean should i instead do many $.getJSON() on each function that needs it?
[16:18:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:18:11] <robertmaxrees> and what's the error you're getting?
[16:18:23] <taplar> it's a little strange how you are returning "promises" with a when
[16:18:49] <taplar> you're only making one ajax call, so using when isn't necessary
[16:19:41] <how2hack> the error is: jQuery.Deferred exception: object is undefined LoadCoinList@http://static.futuramining.com/js/panel.js:150:9
[16:20:53] <taplar> getJSON().then((data) => LoadCoinList(data))  could also just be getJSON().then(LoadCoinList)
[16:21:27] <how2hack> taplar: i reused the example code i got from another user here: https://www.hastebin.com/ehezafegak.js
[16:21:52] <taplar> that's fine, but my point is still valid
[16:21:55] <how2hack> i didn't notice it
[16:21:58] <how2hack> yes
[16:22:37] <how2hack> will that pass the object to the function?
[16:23:04] <taplar> you are giving the then the method that it will call when it resolves
[16:23:32] <taplar> just like how the done is being given the data
[16:24:16] <how2hack> oh you mean LoadCoinList will be the function that .done() does?
[16:24:47] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/zdb5vkw2/
[16:25:21] <taplar> however in that fiddle "object" will most likely be what you expect "data" to be
[16:25:41] <taplar> you can console.log(object) though to see
[16:27:00] <how2hack> yes, that's exactly what i was expecting
[16:28:25] <how2hack> so it is ok to do it like this or should i should use $.getJSON( url ).done(function() {}); when needed instead?
[16:28:51] <taplar> one sec, i want to make sure i'm not going to lie to you
[16:29:36] <taplar> you can use either then() or done()
[16:29:54] <taplar> done is just a wrapper for then() that does not offer an option for providing a failure method at the same time
[16:30:03] <how2hack> i'm using the latest jquery version
[16:30:18] <how2hack> ok
[16:30:33] <taplar> done(fn) => then(fn, null)
[16:30:41] <taplar> shorthand
[16:38:56] <ceramicskull> taplar is something like this viable? clearTimeout(setTimeoutVarHere, 1000);
[16:39:43] <ceramicskull> from the looks of it, I can only pass the setTimeout, but I would like to have the clearTimeout to happen after a certain number of seconds
[16:39:48] <taplar> you don't give the clear method a #
[16:39:57] <taplar> you just give it the variable referencing the timeout
[16:40:15] <taplar> so you'd have to put that clear in a timeout, heh
[16:40:25] <ceramicskull> hmm k
[16:40:45] <taplar> what's the time on the timeout?
[16:40:54] <ceramicskull> 600
[16:41:15] <taplar> so why are you trying to clear it?  it would already have executed before the 1000 was up
[16:41:54] <ceramicskull> because I'm checking for a DOM element, if it doesn't exist after 1000, stop searching, I keep think I may need setInterval instead...
[16:42:31] <taplar> but that doesn't make since, since setTimeout does not repeat
[16:42:49] <taplar> so you make one for 600, it executes, 1000 you clear it, but it's already ran
[16:42:56] <ceramicskull> yea
[16:43:54] <taplar> also can you go into more detail about why you are searching for a dom element to exist?
[16:46:13] <ceramicskull> My banner takes some time to load, like 700, so I'm checking if it's up, if it's not just add a custom banner, its just due to the CMS that they decided to go with --
[16:48:03] <taplar> and by load you mean it takes that long for the markup to be put in the page, or for the image to actually load?  because those are two different things
[16:51:59] <ceramicskull> markup seems to be on page, the image doesn't.
[16:53:32] <taplar> i wonder if you could do a preload for that.
[16:54:48] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content
[16:56:37] <taplar> so what you could potentially do, is make a link in the header to preload the image.  put your fail-safe as the default image.  then you can put an onload event handler on it, and when it loads, replace the fail-safe on the page with the image
[16:56:39] <ceramicskull> Thanks, saved it for future reference, that actually looks really useful, didn't know about that
[16:56:45] <taplar> if it doesn't load, they have the fail-safe
[16:57:23] <bnchprss> I'm trying to loop through a list of divs to create an array that has objects with 2 values (name and gender). I seem to be able to build the array, but it only does it off my first div. Any thoughts here?
[16:57:25] <bnchprss> https://jsfiddle.net/bkLqdwo6/7/
[16:58:25] <taplar> bnchprss: you are doing a global lookup inside your each, rather than a contextual one
[16:58:53] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/bkLqdwo6/9/
[16:59:07] <taplar> you can provide the context as the second argument to the lookup
[17:00:18] <bnchprss> Ah, that totally makes sense!
[17:00:25] <bnchprss> *facepalm*
[17:00:32] <bnchprss> Thanks for clarifying
[18:16:52] <robertmaxrees> let's see if things are any better.
