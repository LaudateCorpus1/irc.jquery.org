[00:25:47] <jefferson> hi folks
[00:26:27] <jefferson> i'm trying to catch when i start typing on an input type="search", but i'm having trouble. Already tried keydown, keypress, inputtext
[00:27:53] <jefferson> http://pastebin.com/LJk1wSm2
[00:27:58] <jefferson> this is my code
[01:48:51] <muley> jefferson... check out live demo at the bottom of the page here http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[02:02:45] <Cork> muley, jefferson: don't use keypress, it's a non standard non cross browser event
[02:03:01] <Cork> muley, jefferson: what you want here is the on('input', func) event
[02:04:58] <Cork> muley, jefferson: https://jsfiddle.net/b2dwdm3z/
[02:29:32] <jon_> hey .. anyone here? .. I have a question about jquery UI
[02:30:05] <jon_> where is $.widget defined? .. I have included the core (including widget) , but console says $.widget is not a function
[02:30:33] <jon_> where is $.widget defined? .. I have included the core (including widget) , but console says $.widget is not a function
[02:30:47] <Cork> jon_: its part of the widgetfactory
[02:31:14] <jon_> will try that. Thanks. BRB
[02:31:46] <Cork> and is imported through the widget.js file
[02:37:24] <jon_> i am building a custom download to reduce the size. I only want jquery UI for a multiselect checkbox dropdown.
[02:37:43] <Cork> jon_: use the download in the ui page
[02:37:49] <jon_> I have included all of the core - core, widget (factory), mouse and position .. still $.widget is undefined
[02:37:52] <Cork> you can pick components there
[02:37:59] <Cork> and it will include what you have to have
[02:38:04] <jon_> yes .. i have picked the whole core
[02:38:34] <Cork> but core is just core
[02:39:06] <Cork> you most likely need all of ui core
[02:39:12] <Cork> at least
[02:39:15] <jon_> yes .. got all of UI core
[02:39:22] <jon_> still getting the issue
[02:39:24] <Cork> then you should have $.widget
[02:39:30] <Cork> check loading order then
[02:39:32] <jon_> sadly, no
[02:39:40] <jon_> ui first, then module
[02:40:09] <Cork> read through the files and find where it defines widget:
[02:40:14] <Cork> as i said it is part of widget
[02:41:57] <jon_> the file i downloaded says Includes: core.js, widget.js, mouse.js, position.js in the header
[02:42:17] <jon_> $.widget = function .. something can be seen in the un-minified version
[02:42:40] <Cork> then you might have a path error
[02:42:44] <Cork> cause again, that should work
[02:43:14] <jon_> also, I am including these in the HTML .. do I have to include for the delay as well? .. The immediate next statement after including custom-ui is including the multi-select module .. what if there is a lag in getting the UI?
[02:43:20] <jon_> is that even a possible issue ?
[02:43:26] <Cork> no
[02:43:34] <jon_> ok
[02:58:31] <ngeksyo> WHOIS
[03:09:30] <bobdobbs> if variable 'foo' is a jquery object that contains a select box, how do I get an attribute of the currently selected option?
[03:10:15] <Cork> bobdobbs: foo.find(':selected').data('foo-value')
[03:10:17] <bobdobbs> actually, I'll rephrase to make it simpler: how do I get the currently selected option?
[03:10:28] <bobdobbs> hai Cork
[03:10:31] <Cork> bobdobbs: if you just want the value of the selected option, just use foo.val()
[03:11:54] <bobdobbs> the value is easy enough.
[03:12:13] <Cork> then the other answer
[03:12:21] <Cork> make sure you prefix the attribute with data- though
[03:12:21] <bobdobbs> experimenting with it now. thanks.
[03:12:52] <Cork> as only value is valid on options (so you need to use the prefix for none standard attributes)
[03:14:22] <bobdobbs> I'm probably having more of a js than a jquery issue, but my attempts to use the pseudoselector keep erroring out...
[03:14:39] <Cork> bobdobbs: make a jsfiddle
[03:14:43] <bobdobbs> k...
[03:16:52] <bobdobbs> https://jsfiddle.net/4vkt2jkf/
[03:17:30] <bobdobbs> In the js, line 12 find the select
[03:17:38] <bobdobbs> I know that that much works
[03:17:54] <bobdobbs> sorry, I meant line 10
[03:17:57] <Cork> bobdobbs: firstly, don't use broken <a> elements for actions, use a <button type="button">
[03:18:08] <Cork> <a> is for links
[03:18:12] <bobdobbs> ok
[03:18:28] <Cork> ah
[03:18:37] <Cork> ya, your syntax is a bit messed up
[03:18:45] <bobdobbs> I thought it might be syntax
[03:18:51] <Cork> $(targetSelect: find(':selected')) => targetSelect.find(':selected')
[03:19:12] <Cork> $(targetSelect: find(':selected')) isn't even valid js
[03:19:24] <bobdobbs> whups. missed that.
[03:20:07] <bobdobbs> yes! I'm getting a hit now!
[03:20:17] <bobdobbs> thanks Cork
[03:20:23] <Cork> :)
[03:20:30] <bobdobbs> I think I've just got tired eyes. I should have seen that
[03:30:28] <joaocastanho> hello :)
[03:31:22] <joaocastanho> $('li.group_'+data.id_group).remove(); $(".group_list_trade").prepend(data.msg);
[03:32:50] <joaocastanho> I have this and I have 3 modals. All of them have this same classes
[03:32:50] <joaocastanho> I know I can use closest, but not really know which target to use
[03:35:08] <AdamPDotty> And we should know what you want to achieve?
[03:36:29] <joaocastanho> My goal is to remove the <li> </li> list
[03:36:32] <joaocastanho> and prepend it
[03:36:51] <joaocastanho> right now with that code, it just do it for all of them
[03:38:05] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty: Do you need a fiddle?
[03:38:16] <AdamPDotty> That might help to understand.
[03:41:32] <joaocastanho> how do I simulate ajax post?
[03:41:33] <joaocastanho> xD
[03:43:28] <AdamPDotty> maybe have a function simply return json-data
[03:44:02] <joaocastanho> ok
[03:48:27] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty: I didn't made the function http://jsbin.com/pavazeyiza
[03:52:12] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty: I know I need to use closest() function. Am I right?
[03:55:50] <AdamPDotty> hmm, I still do not see the problem
[03:56:32] <joaocastanho> what is does it, it removes and prepends on the 3 modals
[03:56:39] <joaocastanho> maybe you can't see that
[04:04:25] <joaocastanho> adam anything wrong?
[04:08:58] <AdamPDotty> I can not find nome_novo_grupo
[04:10:22] <joaocastanho> http://jsbin.com/pavazeyiza/1
[04:11:44] <AdamPDotty> there is uninterpreted php inside the html
[04:11:55] <joaocastanho> ah
[04:12:32] <bobdobbs> Cork: you still around? I'm having trouble getting the data-url from a selected option. https://jsfiddle.net/njxm4ogd/1/
[04:13:06] <bobdobbs> whoops. updated: https://jsfiddle.net/njxm4ogd/2/
[04:13:32] <bobdobbs> I'm not getting anything at all in the console if I run this in a jsfiddle.
[04:13:59] <bobdobbs> If I run it in my own browser I get back an object instead of the attribute value
[04:15:20] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty:  http://jsbin.com/nikobiseja
[04:21:08] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty: will closest be good in here?
[04:22:19] <AdamPDotty> yes. but now I can not find input "id_cromo_troca"
[04:26:17] <joaocastanho> http://jsbin.com/nikobiseja
[04:29:51] <troll_king> joaocastanho try console to see if you get any values?
[04:30:02] <Maxou> Hey why   var basename = $(this).closest('a.basename').text(); give me nothing ?
[04:30:30] <troll_king> try find?
[04:31:31] <joaocastanho> troll_king i get values, that's not the problem
[04:31:49] <joaocastanho> the problem is to find the right one
[04:33:40] <Maxou> var basename = $(this).closest('tr td a.basename').text();
[04:33:55] <AdamPDotty> It is possible, that the modal-plugin (bootstrap?) changes the DOM.
[04:34:45] <troll_king> that what i say try console for testing $this closest code
[04:36:47] <joaocastanho> where?
[04:37:07] <troll_king> your code works but its show ""
[04:37:29] <troll_king> because value does not exits in text box
[04:39:07] <troll_king> if i put manual value it give me value of $("this").closest('.modal-body').find(".nome_novo_grupo").val();
[04:40:37] <joaocastanho> then what should I debug?
[04:40:56] <joaocastanho> because the code removes the same li class in all modals
[04:42:28] <troll_king> data-oh like something is good
[04:44:53] <bobdobbs> I'm having trouble chaining methods. This line returns a jQuery object: this.closest('el') . However, this line errors out:  this.closest('el').attr('class')
[04:45:50] <bobdobbs> The error is "uncaught type error: this.closest(...).attr is not a function"
[04:46:19] <bobdobbs> but that's weird... because if I can call closest() on an element, then that means I should be able to chain, right?
[04:46:33] <Uhkis> you want $(this)
[04:46:39] <bobdobbs> I mean, I should be able to chain jQuery methods, shouldn't O
[04:46:50] <bobdobbs> Uhkis: I think I tried that. I'll try again...
[04:47:07] <bobdobbs> oh
[04:47:23] <bobdobbs> I obviously didn't try it. Or maybe I tried $("this")
[04:47:51] <bobdobbs> working with 'this' always ends with my chasing my tail around the room
[04:47:53] <bobdobbs> thank you!
[05:06:37] <joaocastanho> AdamPDotty: You're around? What should I do?
[05:33:19] <Baako> hi guys. i am using jquery .post method. i wanted to show a loading icon while waiting for the response. How i am using .post is this $.post("main.php", "f=mainfetch", function(d) { }); i did a bit of googling around and all i could find was ajaxComplete method and i am wondering is that the only way to do this?
[05:34:10] <Cork> Baako: firstly i would recommend using { f: "manifetch" } instead of the param string
[05:34:17] <Cork> makes the code more readable
[05:34:52] <Baako> Cork, what do you mean
[05:34:58] <Cork> secondly showLoadingIcon(); $.post().always(function() { hideLoadingIcon() });
[05:35:10] <Baako> whats the different
[05:35:20] <Cork> $.post("main.php", { f: "mainfetch" }, func)
[05:35:25] <Cork> just more readable
[05:35:35] <Cork> if you ever need to add dynamic content it is a lot safer too
[05:35:51] <Cork> $.post("main.php", { f: "mainfetch", someting: variable }, func)
[05:36:23] <Cork> Baako: btw .always() is the same as the old complete callback
[05:38:43] <Baako> Cork, thanks give me a few mins let me try it please
[05:49:14] <walidvb> hm i can't figure out what is wrong with this: https://jsfiddle.net/rvzgkdex/4/
[05:49:41] <Cork> walidvb: nothing matches the selector
[05:49:48] <walidvb> i see in the chosen source code that they bind the onmouseover event, and prevent Default
[05:50:00] <walidvb> Cork: ?? click event works
[05:50:43] <Cork> ah, select replacement...
[05:51:10] <Cork> bty textContent isn't cross browser
[05:51:13] <Cork> *btw
[05:52:52] <walidvb> Cork: fair enough, i'm just testing the hover event detection
[05:52:55] <Cork> walidvb: also the plugin uses return false to abort click events
[05:53:04] <Cork> so your handler won't be called if it cancels it
[05:53:09] <walidvb> click?
[05:53:12] <walidvb> you mean hover
[05:53:17] <walidvb> arf i'd missed that though
[05:54:04] <Robdgreat> ls
[05:54:09] <Robdgreat> damn it -_-
[05:55:09] <Baako> Cork, $.post.always is not a function
[05:55:10] <Cork> and no they never do preventDefault on hover or mousemove
[05:55:19] <Cork> Baako: $.post().always
[05:55:32] <Cork> basically you do .always on the return value from $.post()
[05:56:22] <Cork> Robdgreat: anyway, i would recommend staying away from dropdown replacement plugins
[05:56:37] <Cork> cause they tend to cause bad user experiences depending on what platform they are on
[05:56:49] <Cork> (mostly touch ones)
[05:57:50] <Robdgreat> Cork: I assume you didn't mean to highlight me?
[05:58:00] <Cork> ugg ya wrong nick
[05:58:07] <Cork> walidvb: ^ mean you
[05:58:26] <walidvb> oops sry.
[05:58:40] <walidvb> Cork: i beleive chosen doesn't trigger on touch devices
[05:58:54] <Cork> walidvb: well that means your js will break
[05:59:05] <walidvb> also, i kind of need that to scroll though a 700 list
[05:59:33] <walidvb> and, it's not for me, for a friend's school project, he just needs smth like this, we're good with the potential accessibility issues :)
[05:59:55] <Cork> walidvb: when you hit that long lists autocomplete is normally a better choice
[06:09:52] <joaocastanho> $(this).closest('.lista_grupos_add_troca').find('li.grupo_8').remove();
[06:09:55] <joaocastanho> should this be working?
[06:11:19] <Cork> depends on the dom structure
[06:11:35] <Cork> (aka make a jsfiddle)
[06:11:51] <joaocastanho> http://jsbin.com/nikobiseja
[06:11:53] <joaocastanho> right here
[06:12:12] <Cork> please don't use jsbin
[06:12:16] <joaocastanho> really?
[06:12:18] <joaocastanho> why?
[06:12:18] <Cork> it loses changes all the time
[06:12:25] <Cork> your link is empty
[06:13:03] <joaocastanho> jsfiddle is slow in here
[06:13:13] <Cork> might be, but it at lest works
[06:13:32] <joaocastanho> can't delete in jsfiddle?
[06:13:50] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[06:13:59] <Cork> http://www.webdevout.net/test is another option
[06:14:12] <Cork> a bit more work though
[06:14:32] <joaocastanho> I mean, make it private or delete it
[06:14:38] <Cork> no you can't
[06:14:46] <Cork> most of those sites can't
[06:14:55] <joaocastanho> jsbin you can
[06:15:07] <Cork> ya, so private no one can use it...
[06:16:26] <joaocastanho> okay
[06:16:28] <ircbaako> Cork, the always method does it expect json?
[06:16:36] <ircbaako> i am getting a console error when i use it. Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 4
[06:16:55] <ircbaako> but when i just use $.post() my code works fine
[06:17:26] <ircbaako> $.post().always("main.php", "f=mainfetch" , function(d) {
[06:17:34] <ircbaako> that is how i am using it
[06:18:03] <Cork> uh
[06:18:05] <Cork> no...
[06:18:09] <joaocastanho> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/b80sdfyw/
[06:18:17] <Cork> ircbaako: .post should be the same as you used before
[06:18:25] <Cork> .always only takes a function for the callback
[06:18:39] <Cork> joaocastanho: for reference this is what you sent http://i.imgur.com/N3siJzb.png
[06:18:57] <joaocastanho> it wasn't like that in here
[06:19:01] <joaocastanho> but I think it was expired
[06:19:06] <joaocastanho> that's what it said
[06:19:07] <Cork> ya, that is exactly the problem with jsbin
[06:19:13] <joaocastanho> yeah lol
[06:19:16] <joaocastanho> it was working before
[06:19:17] <Cork> it loses changes and those only stays in the local browser
[06:19:33] <Cork> making it completely useless for support questions
[06:20:07] <joaocastanho> and why they dont fix those bugs?
[06:20:27] <ircbaako> Cork, this is how i am using it
[06:20:27] <ircbaako> http://kopy.io/KpW6j
[06:20:29] <joaocastanho> well, dont worry with that right now
[06:20:34] <joaocastanho> can you help?
[06:20:46] <joaocastanho> ircbaako you use laravel xD?
[06:21:34] <ircbaako> joaocastanho, not for this project
[06:21:59] <joaocastanho> ah okay. kopy.io is one of recommended pastes on their channel :P
[06:22:26] <ircbaako> joaocastanho, :) best paste in the planet
[06:22:33] <joaocastanho> yeah, <3 it
[06:23:58] <Cork> joaocastanho: the links doesn't do anything and something is hiding the related submit button
[06:24:10] <joaocastanho> really?
[06:24:12] <joaocastanho> it works here
[06:26:07] <joaocastanho> $('li.grupo_'+data.id_grupo).remove(); this will remove the <li> for all the modals
[06:29:30] <joaocastanho> Cork: will closest do it?
[06:31:29] <hellyeah-work> 7join #javascript
[06:35:42] <joaocastanho> console.log($(this).closest('li.grupo_8').length); return is 0 xD
[06:35:48] <joaocastanho> So it's wrong? :D
[06:36:48] <hellyeah-work> .grupo_8 is class?
[06:36:54] <hellyeah-work> class of li?
[06:38:48] <joaocastanho> yes
[06:38:48] <joaocastanho> https://jsfiddle.net/b80sdfyw/
[06:38:49] <hellyeah-work> let me take a look
[06:38:49] <joaocastanho> it's not in the fiddle, but it's an example
[06:40:56] <hellyeah-work> what is the problem here exactly?
[06:42:38] <joaocastanho> my problem is that with current code, it deletes the same li in different modals
[06:42:44] <gaf_> hello i need some help here https://jsfiddle.net/4nyn2n4t/4/
[06:42:55] <gaf_> i have table with some teams
[06:43:06] <gaf_> i make it on click to submit value
[06:43:24] <gaf_> and i got result, but can someone help me with this to do not refresh after click?
[06:44:51] <joaocastanho> hellyeah-work you see now?
[06:45:17] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  ajax?
[06:46:10] <gaf_> yes i try but cannot implement
[06:46:15] <hellyeah-work> joaocastanho:  i am sorry it seems it is beyond me
[06:46:18] <gaf_> its just stack when i click and realoding image
[06:46:22] <joaocastanho> really ?
[06:46:29] <gaf_> im not senior in this :)
[06:46:41] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  did you check jquery ajax?
[06:46:52] <joaocastanho> I'm stuck in this, please someone help xD
[06:47:12] <hellyeah-work> joaocastanho:  some guys here can help you hold on here for some moment
[06:47:29] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  i will show you simple example justa moment
[06:48:04] <phpcoder> hello
[06:48:07] <gaf_> i checked a lot of examples and try one
[06:48:12] <gaf_> i can update my code js
[06:48:24] <gaf_> with that version and you can tell me where is wrong
[06:48:31] <phpcoder> guys i have a button inside a <tr>    when i get the click event i do console.log($(this).closest('tr').length);   the result is 0
[06:48:33] <phpcoder> hmm why ?
[06:49:16] <joaocastanho> phpcoder I have similar problem xD
[06:49:42] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/q17emkza/
[06:50:10] <gaf_> hellyeah-work, https://jsfiddle.net/4nyn2n4t/6/
[06:50:14] <gaf_> check my ajax request
[06:50:17] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  let me check
[06:50:33] <gaf_> i add $('#response').html(data); to submit there
[06:50:47] <gaf_> just to check is it working, but its need to set value not to send there :)
[06:50:56] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  dont forget "tidy" your code
[06:51:04] <hellyeah-work> it will indent your codes for you
[06:51:23] <ircbaako> Cork, the always dont seem to work has you expected
[06:52:18] <gaf_> okey, thank you hellyeah-work
[06:52:31] <hellyeah-work> i am not really expert but i can give you some suggestion
[06:52:36] <gaf_> haha good
[06:52:42] <gaf_> me less then you for sure
[06:52:44] <hellyeah-work> you should wrap your click with ajax request
[06:53:05] <hellyeah-work> because when you click button it will do page load and refresh the page
[06:53:21] <gaf_> im clicking on the table
[06:53:25] <gaf_> row is clickble
[06:53:46] <gaf_> but i have one button to implement in this too, but that is for another js
[06:53:51] <gaf_> this is important
[06:54:02] <gaf_> when i click on the row to submit value without refresh
[06:54:07] <gaf_> now its just submiting :)
[06:54:29] <gaf_> and refreshing what is dont want
[06:56:40] <hellyeah-work> gaf_:  this may help you a bit http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/31xmxzhc/
[06:58:21] <hellyeah-work> you write your click function iirc and you wrap wit this function and you call this function in ajax callback
[06:58:48] <hellyeah-work> but people here have more experience and they will read this conversation for sure
[06:59:39] <gaf_> im not that guy
[06:59:45] <gaf_> im junior developer :)
[07:00:00] <gaf_> can you make this in my example?
[07:01:55] <phpcoder> how is that possible
[07:01:55] <phpcoder> ?
[07:01:58] <phpcoder> someone could help me?
[07:02:00] <hellyeah-work> actually we can go together
[07:02:09] <phpcoder> it is not possible that it cant find the tr
[07:02:16] <hellyeah-work> did you read jquery ajax or jquery post
[07:02:41] <hellyeah-work> it is not acceptable behaivour here to give full solution
[07:02:59] <hellyeah-work> you will improve yourself also i am not really expert
[07:03:31] <phpcoder> hellyeah-work, are you talking to me?
[07:03:31] <phpcoder> no?
[07:04:03] <hellyeah-work> to gaf_
[07:04:21] <phpcoder> k
[07:06:47] <ircbaako> i have a div with class "names" i want to add something after the closing div. i understand append and appendTo will end up added inside the name clas but what method do i need to add after the name class?
[07:06:57] <phpcoder> however i tried closest and parent
[07:07:03] <phpcoder> the length is 0
[07:07:26] <ircbaako> <div class="name">hshsh</div><div class="addaftername">hssh</div>
[07:07:50] <ircbaako> addaftername is what i am trying to achieve
[07:08:06] <hellyeah-work> phpcoder:  did you fiddle it?
[07:09:08] <hellyeah-work> ircbaako:  do you want to add an element after one element like x -> y
[07:09:30] <ircbaako> hellyeah-work, hellyeah
[07:09:41] <hellyeah-work> append method should do this
[07:09:57] <hellyeah-work> sec
[07:10:14] <hellyeah-work> yeah append do this first you gonna select an element
[07:10:24] <hellyeah-work> then a.append(b) smt like that
[07:20:40] <Cork> ircbaako: $('.names').after('<span>hello</span>')
[07:20:48] <Cork> that is what you're looking for
[07:21:16] <ircbaako> Cork, append see to do it too
[07:21:27] <Cork> ircbaako: append adds it inside the element
[07:21:30] <Cork> not after
[07:22:16] <Cork> <elm class="names">something<span>hello</span></elm> <-- append
[07:22:21] <Cork> <elm class="names">something</elm><span>hello</span> <-- after
[07:22:26] <ircbaako> make sense will try that too
[07:22:45] <Cork> <elm class="names"><span>hello</span>something</elm> <-- prepend
[07:22:49] <Cork> (when we're at it)
[07:23:31] <hellyeah-work> adding element after element sounds like creating another element and append it to body as distinct node
[07:23:35] <hellyeah-work> am i correct?
[07:23:44] <Cork> no
[07:23:53] <Cork> the creating of the content is the same
[07:24:11] <Cork> the difference is where you insert it in relation to other elements
[07:24:35] <ircbaako> Cork, is right accept add it has a last element inside the selector not after it
[07:24:37] <hellyeah-work> if you add element after an element
[07:24:43] <ircbaako> append NOT accept
[07:24:48] <hellyeah-work> hmm thos two elements are siblings now?
[07:25:03] <Cork> sure
[07:25:10] <Cork> and it becomes a child if you use append
[07:25:23] <hellyeah-work> ircbaako:  with append, you become element child
[07:25:31] <Cork> the only difference is the parentNode and prevNode pointers
[07:25:52] <hellyeah-work> afaik javascript has a method like insertBefore, insertAfter
[07:26:00] <hellyeah-work> jquery must have equal methods
[07:26:05] <Cork> no
[07:26:08] <Cork> there is no insertAfter
[07:26:16] <hellyeah-work> hmm sorry then
[07:27:50] <hellyeah-work> jquery has insertAfter :D
[07:28:42] <Cork> ya, but that is just a helper that reverts source.insertAfter(container) to container.after(source)
[07:28:54] <Cork> s/reverts/converts/
[07:28:54] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> ya, but that is just a helper that converts source.insertAfter(container) to container.after(source)
[07:29:20] <ircbaako> yep knewn it
[07:29:22] <Cork> same with insertBefore, appendTo and so on
[07:30:57] <hellyeah-work> what about prepend
[07:31:13] <Cork> it uses insertBefore
[07:31:27] <Cork> (it finds the first child and inserts it before it)
[07:31:44] <hellyeah-work> then prepend is wrapper for insertbefore?
[07:31:49] <Cork> no
[07:31:54] <hellyeah-work> container?
[07:31:59] <hellyeah-work> hmm
[07:32:01] <Cork> the dom insertBefore method
[07:32:33] <Cork> jquery.fn.insertBefore => jquery.fn.before (revert relation)
[07:33:00] <Cork> jquery.fn.prepend => dom.insertBefore (not to be confused with jquery.fn.insertBefore)
[07:34:24] <hellyeah-work> understand
[07:37:24] <daslicht> anyone knows a continious linear scrolling scrolling carousel like this example here :
[07:37:26] <daslicht> https://plnkr.co/edit/tkiRH8jpRNH7qFv8FM37?p=preview
[07:38:14] <daslicht> in teh example I hacked flickity
[07:38:22] <daslicht> but a non hacked version would be better :)
[07:38:54] <daslicht> another thing is that I need to have images from different height in there and they need to be vertical aligned
[07:38:58] <daslicht> any idea?
[07:39:04] <daslicht> please
[09:33:06] <MajorTennis> knockoutjs doesn't look terrible
[09:42:32] <AdamPDotty> I am not a witch.
[10:07:20] <lejocelyn> hi, I'm trying the promise function in jquery, is it a good way to use it : https://jsfiddle.net/4p4djsn4/ ?
[10:07:51] <lejocelyn> i mean, it seems that my data aren't collected in the data variable
[10:08:00] <lejocelyn> is there something wrong in this code ?
[10:08:26] <lejocelyn> the json returned by the php page works well
[10:08:38] <lejocelyn> arg
[10:08:40] <lejocelyn> I know
[10:08:42] <lejocelyn> :D
[10:13:33] <lejocelyn> Hum, I updated the code but it still doesn't work : https://jsfiddle.net/4p4djsn4/1/
[10:14:25] <taplar> uh
[10:14:50] <lejocelyn> the script doesn't get inside the following function : text_data.done(function(data){})
[10:15:04] <taplar> your creating a function call with data from php, which is then going to call an ajax request on the front it do do something else
[10:15:23] <taplar> why not just give it the data that the ajax call will return rather than doing the ajax call?
[10:16:43] <lejocelyn> yeah, I know it's stupid, but I don't know how to get the GET data into the javascript code
[10:16:44] <lejocelyn> :D
[10:17:16] <taplar> just like your doing with your function
[10:17:45] <taplar> var something = '<?php return your stuff ?>';
[10:18:08] <taplar> or echo or print, whatever
[10:19:06] <taplar> or it looks like your going to be displaying it
[10:19:17] <taplar> just display it, no need for the methods at all...
[10:19:39] <lejocelyn> ok
[10:26:37] <lejocelyn> taplar: any idea else for my problem with the promise function ?
[10:27:29] <lejocelyn> is the function get_text() wrong in itself ?
[10:28:38] <taplar> i'd need to see the generated code
[10:28:49] <lejocelyn> firebug can see the json file
[10:28:58] <taplar> i'm guessing your missing surrounding quotes on the input
[10:29:12] <taplar> but your printing those so nvm
[10:30:05] <lejocelyn> taplar: the script works fine else, the problem being codes inside the promise function isn't being execute
[10:30:08] <lejocelyn> executed
[10:31:01] <taplar> what promise?
[10:31:25] <lejocelyn> taplar: return
[10:31:32] <lejocelyn> taplar: oups  var response = $jq.Callbacks();
[10:31:39] <taplar> that's not a promise...
[10:32:30] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[10:32:48] <taplar> fwiw, $.ajax returns a deferred/promise
[10:36:43] <lejocelyn> taplar: ok
[10:37:25] <taplar> but like i said, it's a little strange that your building a request with php that then requests more stuff from php, instead of just returning what you know your going to need
[10:37:55] <taplar> it's not like in some cases your not going to do that
[10:38:13] <taplar> at least with that code snipplet
[10:39:22] <lejocelyn> yep, I understand you point
[10:39:33] <lejocelyn> I'll think about it
[10:39:43] <lejocelyn> even though it doesn't explain why it doesn't work
[10:40:37] <taplar> cause it's not a promise.  i already said that.  nothing ties callbacks to your ajax call
[10:40:58] <taplar> you should return $.ajax and then .done() off of that would work
[10:43:47] <lejocelyn> taplar: ? I've written var response = $jq.Callbacks();  then $jq.ajax({blablabla}).done(response.fire);
[10:46:41] <joaocastanho> how to calculate age with javascript?
[10:50:00] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: you can't
[10:50:04] <jomofcw> Hello !
[10:50:33] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: what you can is asking the user about it :)
[10:50:52] <jomofcw> Is there a way to block the action of the tab key ? I've tried a "event.preventDefault();" in the "keyUp" and in the "keyDown" event, but it doesn't stop it :/.
[10:51:19] <taplar> you'd want to do it in keydown
[10:51:31] <taplar> might have to stop propagation as well
[10:52:54] <lejocelyn> taplar: what's weird is that I've been doing this way for ages
[10:53:26] <taplar> the whole callbacks thing?
[10:53:44] <lejocelyn> yes
[10:54:03] <lejocelyn> I think actually the problem might be in the jason array
[10:54:17] <lejocelyn> maybe it doesn't like numbered array
[10:54:22] <joaocastanho> lejocelyn: That's what I need eheh
[10:54:27] <jomofcw> Hello taplar
[10:54:29] <joaocastanho> but I found something online the thing is
[10:54:44] <jomofcw> Talltree OK i'll try to stop propagation too
[10:54:44] <joaocastanho> $("#day").change(function(){ }
[10:55:25] <joaocastanho> lejocelyn this works well in chrome and explorer, but in firefox, (this is a select option), it doesn't work well
[10:55:34] <jomofcw> taplar, doesn't work better :/ I shall miss something, it drive me crazy :/.
[10:55:43] <lejocelyn> taplar: the getAudio function here https://jsfiddle.net/4p4djsn4/2/ works very well
[10:56:07] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: try to use the jsfiddle.net to give an example
[10:56:29] <joaocastanho> let me grab it
[11:04:36] <joaocastanho> lejocelyn: https://jsfiddle.net/13rf8etf/1/
[11:04:39] <joaocastanho> does it work in firefox?
[11:05:22] <joaocastanho> just try like this
[11:05:46] <joaocastanho> select the day select, and just click down with keyboard
[11:05:54] <joaocastanho> it wont change
[11:06:01] <joaocastanho> but if you select with your mouse it will work
[11:08:08] <joaocastanho> getting my point lejocelyn?
[11:09:05] <taplar> yay, prod issues dealt with
[11:09:53] <joaocastanho> should I use keyup?
[11:12:06] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: normal no, days and months don't change the year
[11:12:34] <joaocastanho> what?
[11:12:36] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: isn't it normal ? changing the day and the month of birth don't change the number of years you have
[11:13:07] <joaocastanho> the issue is on keyup
[11:13:11] <joaocastanho> when changing
[11:13:21] <joaocastanho> it works okay in chrome and IE
[11:13:46] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: why is there two Dia in the select option ?
[11:14:13] <lejocelyn> joaocastanho: it works for me
[11:14:28] <joaocastanho> can we teamview and I'll show you what's the problem?
[11:14:30] <lejocelyn> if I change the year with the key, it changes the result
[11:15:17] <joaocastanho> so, first you select the box
[11:15:25] <joaocastanho> then clicking on your down key
[11:15:30] <joaocastanho> does it change in firefox?
[11:15:50] <joaocastanho> how can I make a gif to show you this?
[11:17:01] <joaocastanho> did you see?
[11:18:00] <joaocastanho> I think I'm going to use .on('keyup change'
[11:19:01] <joaocastanho> it worked like that
[11:20:54] <taplar> you know you can combine those guys right?
[11:21:30] <taplar> $('#month, #day, #year').on('keyup change', dateValidation);
[11:22:14] <joaocastanho> I did not know that
[11:22:16] <joaocastanho> thanks
[11:23:30] <joaocastanho> cool. a lot simpler
[11:24:35] <ExoUNX> ok so this is fun
[11:25:07] <ExoUNX> so idk if this is a js issue or server-side code issue
[11:26:14] <ExoUNX> so when a radio button is clicked it does onclick and will reload the page. I added some server side code (no js involved) to show/hide a html element and it almost works perfectly...almost
[11:26:49] <joaocastanho> did you add preventDefault(); ?
[11:26:49] <ExoUNX> wait h/o.....
[11:26:54] <ExoUNX> I may of though of a fixed
[11:27:37] <ExoUNX> nope
[11:27:39] <ExoUNX> but anywaysd
[11:27:52] <ExoUNX> the top radio button will load the page and then be selected
[11:28:12] <ExoUNX> however the bottom one when I click it will load the page but then check the top radio button again, BUT only sometimes
[11:28:17] <ExoUNX> sometimes it will work as intended
[11:31:26] <ExoUNX> does jquery have an alt for this?
[11:31:32] <lejocelyn> taplar: now it works, it was a typo error, the general principal of how I used the callback is ok
[11:35:09] <Pazician> why does my submit function not work, it reloads the page even if a both preventDefault and return false;? https://pastee.org/ms27n
[11:35:32] <jiggerypokery> Hello all, I have a single page app that contains an iframe gets updated frequently.
[11:36:32] <jiggerypokery>  If I put a method to retrieve the contents of the frame, I seem to be suffering memory leaks.
[11:37:16] <jiggerypokery> return $('my frame selector').contents()
[11:37:42] <jiggerypokery> Is the $() stored within jquery somewhere and not garbage collected?
[11:38:27] <jiggerypokery> anyone know a pattern I should be using to ensure the contents are retrieved fresh each method call and previous selections are collected?
[11:39:22] <danemacmillan> In jQuery2 was anything changed when handling promises? For example, $.when(content).always(function(){})....etc
[11:40:27] <danemacmillan> Or rather, when dealing with deferreds?
[12:05:30] * dw1 tries getting dashicons into jqm buttons
[12:05:34] <dw1> anyone know how ? :/
[12:06:38] <dw1> might have to chop up the sprite
[12:06:40] <duch_kazatel> target the button and use the css dashicons tells you to use.
[12:06:47] <dw1> k
[12:09:41] <Pazician> why does my submit function not work, it reloads the page even if a both preventDefault and return false;? https://pastee.org/ms27n
[12:09:50] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: yo
[12:10:18] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the form dynamically?
[12:10:30] <danemacmillan> is #send-message-form the form or the submit button?
[12:10:36] <Pazician> remember me from yesterday? I solved it by doing like this: https://pastee.org/u2d4z
[12:10:40] <Pazician> it's the form
[12:10:50] <danemacmillan> Also, for future compatility, use on('submit',
[12:11:05] <robertmaxrees> put a console.log() before that and check if the element even exists at that point.
[12:11:05] <Pazician> danemacmillan: good to know, thanks
[12:11:08] <dw1> meh https://github.com/commadelimited/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack
[12:11:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm?  are they deprecating .submit()?
[12:11:31] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: I can't bcuz it doesn't even run the function since it reloads the page on submit
[12:11:52] <robertmaxrees> Pazician before the binding yo.
[12:11:56] <Pazician> oh
[12:12:13] <danemacmillan> jQuery's recommended the on method for ages. jQuery3 removes some of them, not just deprecates them
[12:12:15] <Pazician> yep, the code above is working just fine
[12:12:33] <Pazician> it's just the submit function that's flipping out
[12:12:33] <robertmaxrees> danemacmillan where'd you see they're deprecating submit?
[12:12:44] <robertmaxrees> Pazician so you're checking the length of that selector?
[12:13:10] <Pazician> yeah, it returns "1"
[12:13:12] <Pazician> int
[12:13:12] <danemacmillan> I haven't explicitly seen it, but it's the trend of other known ones, like .load() being deprecated and finally removed in 3
[12:13:39] <robertmaxrees> danemacmillan that was because load was confusing fwiw.
[12:13:41] <robertmaxrees> but okay ;)
[12:13:42] <Pazician> danemacmillan: so basically on replaces the .load, etc?
[12:13:46] <danemacmillan> https://blog.jquery.com/2016/05/20/jquery-3-0-release-candidate-released/
[12:14:08] <danemacmillan> Pazician: Don't let me confuse you right now. I just recommend you eventually learn on()
[12:14:10] <robertmaxrees> i read it :)
[12:14:21] <Pazician> danemacmillan: yeah, alright
[12:14:23] <robertmaxrees> i suggest people use .on() all the time, fwiw.
[12:15:03] <robertmaxrees> either way, Pazician do you have any errors in your console?
[12:15:06] <danemacmillan> confusing because of the load shorthand for actually retrieving async content
[12:15:09] <Pazician> no
[12:15:12] <Pazician> no errors
[12:15:29] <robertmaxrees> danemacmillan yep.  a lot of the other shorthand event handlers don't suffer from that luckily.
[12:16:39] <Pazician> All tho, the first one is working fine... the first row is running, but the other ones not running at all?
[12:17:24] <Pazician> they're the same too
[12:17:36] <Pazician> reffering to the HTML
[12:18:04] <robertmaxrees> slow way down.
[12:18:21] <robertmaxrees> #send-msg-form - how many of these do you have?
[12:18:42] <robertmaxrees> like, are you saying there are multiples of that?
[12:18:55] <Pazician> yes, correct
[12:19:01] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:19:12] <robertmaxrees> that's an ID. you can't repeat an ID on a page.
[12:19:15] <robertmaxrees> use a class in stead.
[12:19:19] <robertmaxrees> *instead
[12:19:23] <Pazician> oh
[12:19:24] <Pazician> god
[12:19:45] <robertmaxrees> notice how .length only returned 1? ;)
[12:20:04] <Pazician> f me maan
[12:20:09] <Pazician> you got it!
[12:20:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:20:21] <Pazician> thank you so much, i was like struggling two days now with this
[12:21:13] <Pazician> hold on
[12:21:16] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[12:21:31] <Pazician> it's still not working properly
[12:21:46] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.messages-wrapper').find('send-msg-wrap').fadeOut();
[12:21:48] <robertmaxrees> right?
[12:21:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:21:58] <robertmaxrees> $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[12:22:01] <Pazician> the first one is working fine, as expected, but the other ones reloads the page still
[12:22:03] <Pazician> really?
[12:22:20] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:22:29] <robertmaxrees> because that clzass change should have fixed that.
[12:23:08] <Pazician> oh
[12:23:16] <Pazician> didn't notice the missing "."
[12:23:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:23:21] <Pazician> as you mentioned
[12:23:22] <Pazician> lol
[12:23:53] <Pazician> i'm happy dude
[12:23:57] <robertmaxrees> alright.  so then you need to fix your success handler.
[12:23:58] <Pazician> this is rocking!
[12:24:04] <Pazician> yep
[12:24:17] <robertmaxrees> also: var sent_from = $(".sent_from").val();
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> that's only going to get the value of the first one.
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:25:13] <robertmaxrees> also kill that return false.
[12:26:06] <Pazician> why only the first one? but one more thing - it doesn't run the queries, it throws an error I've in my function that says "You need more than 2 chars..."
[12:26:28] <Pazician> it has to be the .msg class or something
[12:26:41] <robertmaxrees> because .val() only gets the first value in a selection.
[12:26:44] <Pazician> yeah right, as you said only the first value of the row will run
[12:26:48] <Pazician> right
[12:26:54] <Pazician> hmm... so how do I fix that?
[12:26:54] <robertmaxrees> I assume you have multiple .sent_form elements, right?
[12:26:59] <Pazician> right
[12:26:59] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle ;)
[12:27:12] <robertmaxrees> you need to make all the code relative to the $(this) object.
[12:27:44] <Pazician> oh, so basically something like $(this).find...
[12:27:45] <Pazician> ?
[12:28:13] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:29:27] <Pazician> alright, I got but I don't understand why I need to double click to make the query run and insert the data into the db?
[12:29:40] <Pazician> like the first click throws an error and the second it's inserting
[12:29:49] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea without an example yo.
[12:30:13] <Pazician> one sec
[12:30:37] <robertmaxrees> i'll bet 95% of you problems are because you're always interacting with the first fow.
[12:30:39] <robertmaxrees> row.
[12:30:49] <robertmaxrees> so it's likely to be that you need to do relative selectors.
[12:31:30] <Pazician> Basically this is what I got: https://pastee.org/93yx
[12:32:09] <Pazician> and if you see the if statement on line #47 that's the one it runs
[12:32:12] <Pazician> on the first click
[12:32:36] <Pazician> second click it runs the query
[12:43:32] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: isn't it relative if I use $(this)...?
[12:43:55] <robertmaxrees> is $(this) a parent of those elements?
[12:44:09] <robertmaxrees> like, which part isn't working?
[12:44:32] <Pazician> this is the structure: http://puu.sh/pcUqv/eb827d72d8.png
[12:44:35] <robertmaxrees> dude
[12:44:44] <robertmaxrees> screenshots and thins aren't helpfu;l.
[12:44:46] <Pazician> i know images...
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:44:50] <Pazician> right
[12:44:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> and kill that return false;
[12:45:21] <Pazician> done
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> so have you got a fiddle?>
[12:45:54] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/vptrq297/
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:46:21] <Pazician> what's up?
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> you're missing jquery and you added some extra js.,
[12:46:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:46:53] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vptrq297/1/
[12:46:54] <robertmaxrees> there.
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> sokay.
[12:47:27] <robertmaxrees> so do you know what .find() does?
[12:47:56] <Pazician> I think so, it go "down" and closest goes "up", right?
[12:48:03] <robertmaxrees> children.
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> and ancestors.
[12:48:39] <Pazician> right
[12:49:04] <Pazician> so I assume that the line on #23 is kinda wrong?
[12:49:08] <robertmaxrees> cool.  so you confirmed those vars are what you expect them?
[12:49:24] <Pazician> yes, they should work as expected
[12:49:40] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.messages-wrapper').find('.send-msg-wrap').fadeOut(); - so $(this) is the ajax call itself, not the form.
[12:49:56] <Pazician> oh, right
[12:49:57] <Pazician> ...
[12:50:04] <robertmaxrees> you need to either store a reference to $(this) at the top of your handler and use that var, or use .bind() to pass the right context.
[12:51:41] <Pazician> but let me define what I see on line #23 - $(this) = the submit button I clicked on, closest = it goes up, finding the .send-msg-wrap which is inside the .messages-wrapper and then it should fadeOut, right?
[12:51:58] <robertmaxrees> but $(this) isn't the form there.
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> if it were, sure.
[12:52:56] <robertmaxrees> except not actually.
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('.messages-wrapper') just looks for the first ancestor of the current element that matches that selector.
[12:53:32] <xenaxon> hi all !
[12:53:46] <xenaxon> $('#elDropper').on('DOMNodeInserted', '.formComponent', function (e) {
[12:54:06] <xenaxon> I am using this event handler and I am creating an accordion on the e.target
[12:54:22] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: hmm... so what's $(this) then if it's not the submit?
[12:54:31] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the ajax function.
[12:54:37] <robertmaxrees> i already explained that.
[12:54:40] <xenaxon> but it seems some problem appears with the content of that div as well. all the sub-elements are given accordion classes and they act strange
[12:54:47] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Mutation_events
[12:55:01] <robertmaxrees> don't use DOMNodeInserted - it's deprecated.
[12:55:03] <danemacmillan> yep, DOMNodeInserted is nice
[12:55:07] <danemacmillan> but deprecated
[12:55:35] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon do you control the function creating the elements you're trying to watch?
[12:55:46] <xenaxon> yes
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> modify that function then.
[12:55:55] <xenaxon> currentComponent = $(e.target).accordion({
[12:55:57] <robertmaxrees> or approach this differently.
[12:56:04] <xenaxon> this is giving me the problem
[12:56:06] <robertmaxrees> don't use mutation events.
[12:56:19] <robertmaxrees> this is exactly WHY do you don't do this :)
[12:56:26] <xenaxon> I can't. this is necessary for other parts of the app
[12:56:37] <xenaxon> currentComponent = $(e.target).accordion({
[12:56:39] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[12:56:42] <xenaxon> this is acting strange
[12:56:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:56:58] <xenaxon> because e.target is actually giving back both the div and everything inside
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're modifying that subtree, which fires the handler, which modifies the subtree, which fiures the handler, etc.
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> so fix your other code instead.
[12:57:19] <xenaxon> so the accordion function applies styles and procedures to both the actual div and all it's child elements
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> right
[12:57:24] <xenaxon> which gives some strange stuff inside it
[12:57:30] <robertmaxrees> i just exaplained why :)
[12:58:06] <xenaxon> robertmaxrees: yea but, I specified the class on which I want it to fire: .formComponent
[12:58:13] <xenaxon> $('#elDropper').on('DOMNodeInserted', '.formComponent', function (e) {
[12:58:16] <robertmaxrees> right, welcome to how events and bubbling work.
[12:58:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> that will fire whenever that element emits that event - that includes any of its children.
[12:59:15] <xenaxon> any idea what to do to get only the main div from e.target?
[12:59:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:59:27] <robertmaxrees> don't use an event handler for this.
[12:59:44] <xenaxon> impossible. this has to be done like this
[12:59:53] <xenaxon> other parts of the app depend on it
[13:00:07] <taplar> i like 'impossible'
[13:00:36] <robertmaxrees> something smells here.
[13:00:52] <xenaxon> taplar: impossible in my termbook can also mean: "reworking the whole app:
[13:01:03] <xenaxon> taplar: which is... impossible
[13:01:03] <xenaxon> :))
[13:01:05] <robertmaxrees> you want this code to affect the whole app, right?
[13:01:15] <taplar> not feasable
[13:01:21] <taplar> ^ better
[13:01:32] <robertmaxrees> "it seems like it might be really difficult"
[13:01:40] <taplar> imho, programmers should forget the terms 'i cant' and 'impossible' and the like
[13:01:56] <taplar> it's defeatist
[13:02:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:02:18] <robertmaxrees> welp.
[13:02:40] <xenaxon> I was thinking of making an if
[13:02:46] <xenaxon> to check if it's a div
[13:02:52] <robertmaxrees> you can read the documentation on the event object.
[13:03:02] <robertmaxrees> there's infortmation on how to do that.
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> but i woudl strongly caution against doing what you're doing.
[13:03:16] <xenaxon> or actually, to check if it's an object with the class .formComponent
[13:03:21] <robertmaxrees> it's going to perform really poorly.
[13:03:39] <xenaxon> but I don't get it
[13:03:47] <robertmaxrees> get what?
[13:03:50] <xenaxon> why does it trigger for all sub-elements when I gave it
[13:03:56] <xenaxon> $('#elDropper').on('DOMNodeInserted', '.formComponent', function (e) {
[13:03:57] <robertmaxrees> because that's how bubbling works.
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> please stop re-pasting the same line of code over and over.
[13:04:11] <xenaxon> then what's the purpose of that argument??
[13:04:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:04:19] <xenaxon> I can remove it and it's the same thing
[13:04:20] <robertmaxrees> you're looking for any events emitting from that element.
[13:04:24] <robertmaxrees> that includes child elements.
[13:04:30] <robertmaxrees> that's how bubbling works.
[13:04:40] <xenaxon> so is there a way of limiting to that one only?
[13:04:59] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs on the event object.
[13:05:04] <robertmaxrees> it explains how to do what you want.
[13:05:10] <xenaxon> but you are wrong
[13:05:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> i'm not.
[13:05:25] <xenaxon> I am not looking at events emitting from that element
[13:05:31] <xenaxon> because that's the element that is created
[13:05:40] <robertmaxrees> other elements are created under it.
[13:05:42] <xenaxon> it's not emitting anything inside.
[13:05:55] <xenaxon> yeah but everything is being appended at once.
[13:06:04] <robertmaxrees> each element triggers that event,
[13:10:56] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: what's my $(this) when I do a submit on the form?
[13:11:02] <Pazician> I can't get a clue on that one
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:11:10] <Pazician> it should be the submit button right?
[13:11:10] <robertmaxrees> your issue is where you're doing $(this).
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:11:15] <robertmaxrees> it's the form./
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> "you need to either store a reference to $(this) at the top of your handler
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> and use that var, or use .bind() to pass the right context.
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> what about that isn't clear?
[13:12:18] <robertmaxrees> the issue isn't that you're using $(this), it's where.
[13:12:37] <xenaxon> so robertmaxrees any suggestion on how to fix this?
[13:12:55] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon did you check the event object docs?
[13:13:26] <robertmaxrees> Pazician you're doing $(this) inside of the success handler, but the 'this' object isn't what you think it is.  so you do something like var $theForm = $(this); and then use $theForm inside the success handler.
[13:13:38] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
[13:13:40] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: so something like this? https://pastee.org/dpk4p I get this when I console log $this [form.send-msg-form, context: form.send-msg-form]
[13:13:55] <decx> read mdn, make america great again
[13:13:56] <xenaxon> i'm looked at it, but not sure what you want me to see
[13:13:59] <robertmaxrees> Pazician sure.
[13:14:05] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon api.jquery.com/event.target/
[13:14:12] <robertmaxrees> "The target property can be the element that registered for the event or a descendant of it. It is often useful to compare event.target to this in order to determine if the event is being handled due to event bubbling."
[13:14:30] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon but again, I strongly caution against what you're doing here.
[13:14:43] <xenaxon> fixed.
[13:14:46] <Pazician> the thing is still that I need to double click for some reasons the submit button to actually runt the queries in my PHP function
[13:14:50] <xenaxon> I just needed to use this
[13:14:54] <xenaxon> "this" instead of e.target
[13:15:52] <Pazician> do you maybe an idea on what it could be why I need to double click on that submit button to insert the data from the form?
[13:16:01] <robertmaxrees> Pazician i have no idea
[13:16:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to crack open a debugger.
[13:16:53] <Pazician> can I do the same thing with .length in jQuery as I do with strlen() in PHP? if (strlen($msg) <= 2) {
[13:17:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php.
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what you're asking.
[13:17:17] <Pazician> I want to check the string length
[13:17:22] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the length of a string?
[13:17:22] <Pazician> like how many chars it got
[13:17:26] <Pazician> right
[13:17:42] <robertmaxrees> .length on jquery objects tells you how many elements are in the collection.
[13:17:48] <robertmaxrees> you want to run .length against a string.
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> like the one returned by .val()
[13:19:12] <Pazician> so liek this? https://pastee.org/bqpgy
[13:19:15] <Pazician> like'
[13:19:32] <robertmaxrees> did you try?
[13:20:39] <xenaxon> robertmaxrees: it was that simple
[13:20:51] <robertmaxrees> xenaxon that event is still deprecated and unreliable.
[13:20:53] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[13:21:04] <xenaxon> it will have to do for now
[13:21:10] <xenaxon> but thanks for the advice
[13:21:12] <xenaxon> noted.
[13:21:43] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: yeah, I tried, sstill need to double click and the append didn't work
[13:21:51] <robertmaxrees> then make a functioning fiddle.
[13:22:03] <Pazician> I did this $this.find('.send-msg-wrap').append('<div class="error_notice">Atleast have 2 characters in your message</div>');
[13:22:28] <Pazician> and this is what I get from the console.log [form.send-msg-form, context: form.send-msg-form]
[13:22:31] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[13:22:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:22:57] <mellybean> does anyone know if there a less terrible way to pass a selector as a argument than this:  $('#'+argumentName+'')
[13:23:11] <robertmaxrees> mellybean no need for that last +'' in there.
[13:23:23] <mellybean> indeed
[13:23:23] <robertmaxrees> but that's how you do it if you need to dynamically create your selectors.
[13:23:28] <mellybean> ok thanks
[13:23:41] <Pazician> robertmaxrees: it's working, I get the error message but I have noo clue why I need to double click on the submit button to send the data
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i like to use .filter() against a class or something instead.
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> Pazician bummer.
[13:23:49] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[13:24:02] <robertmaxrees> without seeing a functioning example of it breaking i've got nothing.  sorry!
[13:24:30] <Pazician> well basically I've this: https://pastee.org/9c569
[13:24:34] <robertmaxrees> fiddle.
[13:24:52] <Pazician> jsfiddle doesn't allow me to actually send the post requests right?
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[13:25:03] <robertmaxrees> and actually, you can simulate them.
[13:25:20] <robertmaxrees> "when i shift my car into 2nd it makes this weird noise" - "oh cool just bring it into the shop and we'll take a look" - "no need, but it sounds kind of like a pinging, grinding sound"
[13:25:40] <Pazician> lol
[13:25:43] <Pazician> great metafor
[13:26:02] <Pazician> "I can send you some pictures tho on the engine, you might see something"
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:26:38] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/5guho15n/
[13:26:49] <robertmaxrees> missing jquery.
[13:27:25] <robertmaxrees> click the gear icon next to "javascript" in that box, then select a recent, non-beta/rc version from the "frameworks & extensions" dropdown.
[13:27:50] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/5guho15n/1/
[13:27:53] <Pazician> like that?
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:28:05] <robertmaxrees> reread what i said.
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5guho15n/2/
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[13:28:54] <Pazician> oh
[13:28:55] <Pazician> https://jsfiddle.net/5guho15n/3/
[13:28:57] <Pazician> damn
[13:28:59] <Pazician> got it
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> lol gotta remove the other version now haha.
[13:29:31] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5guho15n/4/ here we go.
[13:29:41] <Pazician> cool
[13:29:44] <robertmaxrees> so what do I click to make the bug happen?
[13:30:11] <Pazician> when I click on the submit, it doesn't run the function, the PHP function that the Ajax is requesting
[13:30:19] <Pazician> I've to click twice to make an insert
[13:30:32] <robertmaxrees> so the ajax call doesn't fire?  or the php doesn't do what it should?
[13:30:56] <Pazician> the php is doing what it should, since it's working just fine without the ajax call
[13:31:04] <Pazician> it has to be something with the ajax call
[13:31:10] <Pazician> or js overall
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> have you confirmed the ajax call is even happening?
[13:31:41] <Pazician> yeah, it's firing but on the second click it inserting and running the queries
[13:32:11] <robertmaxrees> so your network tab shows the ajax call firing each time?>
[13:33:36] <Pazician> no, just checked that and it's on the second one it's firing
[13:33:43] <robertmaxrees> okay, so it doesn't fire the first time.
[13:33:46] <Pazician> atleast the sucess event
[13:33:50] <Pazician> success*
[13:33:53] <Pazician> right
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[13:34:21] <robertmaxrees> are you in your network tab?
[13:34:29] <robertmaxrees> or are you in your console.
[13:35:02] <Pazician> network
[13:35:41] <robertmaxrees> okay
[13:35:48] <robertmaxrees> so do you see one request fire or two?
[13:36:04] <robertmaxrees> the success handler obviously won't fire for an ajax call that doesn't happen.
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> so i'm confused about why you mentioned that.
[13:37:14] <robertmaxrees> and how do I get text into a text field?
[13:38:04] <Pazician> I don't understand, I did a error 500 in my send_message.php file and on the first call it doesn't show an error in the console, but on the second call (second click) I get the error
[13:38:10] <Pazician> So it has to be something weird going on
[13:38:18] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a php problem to me.
[13:38:18] <Pazician> with script
[13:38:23] <Pazician> really?
[13:38:23] <robertmaxrees> 500 means server-side.
[13:38:26] <Pazician> right
[13:38:33] <robertmaxrees> soooo why would the js be broken?
[13:38:36] <Pazician> I did it with me knowing just to try it out
[13:39:01] <Pazician> bcuz I'm calling the file, and when it gets called it should already on the first call tell me the error right?
[13:39:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm really lost about what you're seeing and when.
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying you're only seeing an ajax call the second time but now it sounds like you're seeing a 500 somewhere on the first one buuuut...
[13:41:29] <Pazician> the first call, the first click when I click on the submit button, like nothing happens, nothing at all. The success handler runs, prints out the 2chars error, and on the Second call the real query that's in my PHP function, is running
[13:41:49] <robertmaxrees> okay, so if the success handler runs, that means the ajax call happens.
[13:42:07] <Pazician> right, but on the second call, why on the second call is what I don't understand
[13:42:18] <Pazician> it should be on the first one
[13:42:32] <robertmaxrees> you just said the success handler runs for the first one.
[13:43:35] <Pazician> yeah, but it doesn't run the query
[13:43:40] <Pazician> or...
[13:43:42] <robertmaxrees> then it's a PHP problem.
[13:43:47] <robertmaxrees> that means an ajax call is happening.
[13:43:49] <Pazician> it runs more likely the if statement
[13:44:05] <robertmaxrees> and you're getting back a valid response.
[13:44:06] <Pazician> this guy right here: if (msg.length > 2) {
[13:44:19] <robertmaxrees> you're passing that check if you're seeing the success handler fire.
[13:45:32] <Pazician> yeah but on the second call I see the fire
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:45:43] <Pazician> like it doesn't get the value or something
[13:46:07] <robertmaxrees> have you console logged data perhaps?
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> and made sure that it's what you expect it to be?
[13:46:25] <robertmaxrees> since the fiddle doesn't actually seem to be functional?
[13:48:41] <Pazician> like this, let me explain what's going on here. I typed "asd" more than 2 chars and then clicked on the submit btn, the error appends below the submit button (the if statement doesn't run, like it didn't get the value of msg) and the second time I click the submit btn it fires off and runs the PHP function: http://puu.sh/pcYpH/9dcc85e6b2.png
[13:48:52] <Pazician> it's a image, I know but for better understanding
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> since you won't replicate any of this in a functioning fiddle i'm not sure how to help you.
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> sorry!  good luck! :)
[13:51:33] <Pazician> when I console.log msg.length I get 0, that means that it doesn't get the value right?
[13:51:49] <robertmaxrees> it did get the value, and the value is empty.
[13:51:53] <robertmaxrees> it's an empty string.
[13:52:21] <Pazician> right, so it's logically that the if statement won't run, right?
[13:52:26] <Pazician> since it's empty on the first call
[13:52:37] <robertmaxrees> put a console.log as the first thing in it and check.
[13:52:46] <robertmaxrees> or use a breakpoint.
[13:52:49] <robertmaxrees> tons of ways to verify.
[13:53:47] <ExoUNX> ok this is lame, onclick() works just fine firefox but doesn't work properly in chrome. When I click the second checkbox it reloads the page but the checkbox isn't set to active everything even though it should be, firefox though works everyime
[13:54:04] <robertmaxrees> ExoUNX don't use onclick - use jquery's .on()
[13:54:13] <Pazician> Alright, first call = 0 sencond call = 11 (html tags) http://puu.sh/pcYOc/20b3002f8e.png
[13:54:15] <robertmaxrees> or addEventListener if you're not using jquery.
[13:54:26] <robertmaxrees> no more screenshots.
[13:54:51] <robertmaxrees> without a functioning fiddle i don't know how to help you since you're really confused about what's actually happening in your code and i'm not sure how else to help you Pazician
[13:55:39] <Pazician> Alright, I see - thank you, I'll try to get this figured out
[14:11:12] <[m]adman> exit
[14:35:41] <ircbaako> is they a function in jquery to upper case the first character and lower the rest?
[14:36:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.  jquery is more for dom manipulation.  check native JS for that kind of stuff.
[14:36:41] <taplar> iirc there's some handy thing you can do with replace or something to do that.  check S.O
[14:37:46] <Pazician> hello again, I try to substring a anchor string, I tried doing like this but I can't make it to return what I want to? https://pastee.org/jqehh
[14:38:54] <taplar> i forget which but substr and substring are different
[14:39:05] <taplar> one takes start and length, the other takes start and stop pos
[14:39:14] <robertmaxrees> substring takes start and stop
[14:40:26] <Pazician> right that's substring
[14:40:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lps7o04z/
[14:40:42] <robertmaxrees> seems to work fine.
[14:41:14] <Pazician> well then this has to be wrong? var anchor = $('.msg-anchor').html();
[14:41:26] <Pazician> since I'm calling it substr(anchor, 50)
[14:41:36] <robertmaxrees> dunno - have you console.log'd that return?
[14:41:47] <robertmaxrees> console.log($('.msg-anchor').html());
[14:42:28] <Pazician> no, never did that - good idea!
[14:42:57] <Pazician> yeah it's returning the whole text inside the anchor
[14:43:01] <arc_> valic's portal for managing your account requires internet explorer, and the message says "ie5+" -_-
[14:43:02] <Pazician> so it should work
[14:43:15] <robertmaxrees> Pazician so what isn't it doing that it should?
[14:43:32] <robertmaxrees> are you sure you're meeting the character limit?
[14:43:40] <Pazician> it should substring the string to just 50 chars and add 3 dots after it
[14:43:43] <robertmaxrees> have you tried reducing your limit to something like "5"?
[14:43:58] <Pazician> for sure, it's a lorem text
[14:44:06] <Pazician> yep, tried just 10 just now
[14:44:28] <robertmaxrees> console.log(substr(anchor, 50));
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> what happens here?
[14:44:52] <Pazician> oh, in the console.log it's working
[14:44:56] <robertmaxrees> all I see is you running substr as a function but you're not doing anything with the return value.
[14:44:59] <Pazician> but not on the page
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> so how are you actually trying to use it?
[14:45:17] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting it to just magically update that html?
[14:45:47] <Pazician> oh, so I should do something like $('.msg-anchor').html(substr(anchor, 10));
[14:45:51] <Pazician> dude...
[14:45:52] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:45:56] <Pazician> you're a hell of a smart guy man
[14:45:57] <robertmaxrees> .html() just returns a string.
[14:46:01] <robertmaxrees> errr
[14:46:03] <robertmaxrees> not really? lol
[14:46:10] <robertmaxrees> this is javascript 101.
[14:46:38] <Pazician> lol
[14:46:46] <robertmaxrees> lean.jquery.com is a good resouce.
[14:46:56] <Pazician> great to know, thank you as always
[14:47:02] <robertmaxrees> give it a run-through.
[14:47:52] <Pazician> one more thing, I want to reset this, dod I just add a giant number like "99999" instead of "10" in the limit argument?
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:48:07] <robertmaxrees> no...
[14:48:10] <Pazician> I want it to reset when a user clicks a link, like to show
[14:48:30] <robertmaxrees> you know there's a text-overflow: ellipsis in css, yeah?
[14:49:09] <Pazician> oh
[14:49:26] <Pazician> So I should use CSS properties instead of jquery?
[14:49:36] <robertmaxrees> you could add/remove a class, yeah
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> that would be a better way.
[14:49:45] <Pazician> right, cool!
[14:49:46] <Pazician> thank you
[14:49:50] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[15:46:13] <lejocelyn> hi guys, I'm trying out animate() but it doesn't work. What's wrong with this https://jsfiddle.net/xmLs2zyu/ ?
[15:47:36] <taplar> try backgroundColor
[15:48:27] <lejocelyn> taplar: https://jsfiddle.net/xmLs2zyu/2/ ?
[15:51:10] <lejocelyn> I still don't get it : https://jsfiddle.net/xmLs2zyu/5/
[15:51:14] <lejocelyn> :'(
[15:54:45] <lejocelyn> hum, seems like a bug : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190560/jquery-animate-backgroundcolor
[15:54:56] <lejocelyn> but that was seven years ago

[16:08:11] <decx> exactly
[16:22:36] <jilocasin0> afternoon everyone.....
[16:23:55] <jilocasin0> quick question re: jquery-ui:autocompletion:  Why does the dropdown of suggestions show the labels, but the post selection _isn't_ the user's choice, but the associated value?
[16:25:58] <devslash> is it possible to hide all elements except for those in a class that I specify
[16:26:20] <jilocasin0> ex: input text element {label: blue, value: 0}, {label: black, value: 1}, {label: green, value: 2}.  User types 'b' sees-> blue, black.  Selects 'black'. Input element now shows 1 (it should show 'black')???
[16:26:30] <taplar> devslash: 'in' ?
[16:26:44] <devslash> how would you do that
[16:26:52] <taplar> what do you mean 'in a class' ?
[16:27:03] <taplar> has the class, or a child of an element with the class?
[16:28:30] <devslash> TBH im not sure .... i want to hide all elements except 1
[16:29:24] <taplar> you can do $(selector).not(selector2)
[16:41:43] <devslash> if my page loads an iframe, is it possible to hide elements within the iframe ?
[16:41:53] <simonsaysdiaf> no
[16:41:56] <simonsaysdiaf> not unless you control the iframe
[16:42:00] <jilocasin0> nevermind (return false; in selected method seems to do it).  kind of odd behaviour, no?
[16:42:18] <devslash> the iframe is another web site of mine
[16:42:33] <simonsaysdiaf> then you can do it from inside the iframe
[16:42:36] <devslash> Not sure how much of a difference that makes.
[16:42:49] <simonsaysdiaf> well if you control the iframe, then you control what it displays....
[16:42:54] <simonsaysdiaf> if it's an external iframe then you don't.
[16:42:55] <devslash> how ? on the page that I am embeeding
[16:43:22] <simonsaysdiaf> you'd have to do it inside the iframe itself. maybe an iframe isn't the right solution for whatever youre trying to do
[16:43:46] <devslash> i want to laod the content from my public website on our internal network
[16:43:56] <devslash> so I am using an iframe to do it
[16:44:04] <simonsaysdiaf> wat
[16:44:14] <simonsaysdiaf> well
[16:44:21] <taplar> if it's cross domain you can't do that
[16:44:24] <simonsaysdiaf> ^
[16:44:33] <devslash> well its not
[16:44:50] <taplar> it's on the same domain?
[16:45:00] <devslash> the domain is nearly the same
[16:45:13] <taplar> http://thisIsTheSame/blah/blah/blah
[16:45:15] <simonsaysdiaf> im not good with iframes, but i do know you can't control whats inside them from outside the frame
[16:45:24] <devslash> our internal intranet is intranet.oursite.com. our public website is www.oursite.com
[16:45:32] <taplar> no, you can't then
[16:45:35] <taplar> that's not the same domain
[16:45:45] <devslash> well the iframe does load the content
[16:46:03] <taplar> doesn't matter.  javascript cannot access an iframes dom for cors
[16:46:05] <devslash> I just want a filtered view
[16:46:27] <simonsaysdiaf> devslash: i think if you want to hide the iframe content you'd have to do a css rule on the public site for something like iframe.content { display:none; }
[16:46:50] <simonsaysdiaf> and tbh
[16:46:52] <simonsaysdiaf> im not even sure that would work
[16:46:54] <simonsaysdiaf> but u could try
[16:46:54] <devslash> the thing is, I only want to hide certain elements when its embeeded in the iframe
[16:46:58] <simonsaysdiaf> well
[16:47:03] <simonsaysdiaf> thats why you preface the rule
[16:47:03] <simonsaysdiaf> with
[16:47:05] <simonsaysdiaf> iframe
[16:47:07] <simonsaysdiaf> like i said
[16:47:08] <taplar> hold on
[16:47:19] <devslash> when its not embedded it should render normally
[16:47:23] <taplar> you want to do it if it's in an iframe, always?  no exception?
[16:47:30] <devslash> yes
[16:47:36] <simonsaysdiaf> devslash: thats why you use the iframe to target it
[16:47:37] <simonsaysdiaf> jfc
[16:47:39] * simonsaysdiaf facepalms
[16:47:46] <taplar> ok, then you can do that.  on your iframe page you can check window.top.location.href
[16:47:52] <simonsaysdiaf> iframe .content { display:none!important; }
[16:47:58] <simonsaysdiaf> ^^is how i'd try first
[16:48:02] <taplar> if it's not the same as your window.location.href then it's in an iframe
[16:48:05] <simonsaysdiaf> since that'll be the easiest way
[16:48:17] <devslash> simonsaysdiaf, that goes on the public site's css right ?
[16:48:19] <simonsaysdiaf> ya
[16:48:29] <devslash> ok thanks
[16:48:34] <simonsaysdiaf> np :)
[16:48:42] <simonsaysdiaf> if my way doesnt work
[16:48:46] <simonsaysdiaf> then do what taplar said
[16:48:52] <taplar> iframe .content ?
[16:48:55] <simonsaysdiaf> well
[16:49:00] <taplar> your trying to do a css rule across an iframe?
[16:49:01] <simonsaysdiaf> idk what the class is for the stuff you want to hide
[16:49:03] <ircbaako> hi guys i need abit of help please https://jsfiddle.net/baako/utp58atd/3/ i want to remove the element as well has gray out the element just in case the user press it twice
[16:49:03] <simonsaysdiaf> taplar: no no
[16:49:38] <simonsaysdiaf> taplar: inside the iframe is site.com site.com haas styles.css. put iframe .class { display:none!important; } inside the website's styles.css
[16:49:45] <simonsaysdiaf> that MIGHT work
[16:49:49] <taplar> nope
[16:49:50] <ircbaako> what happens is when the press the button a jquery ajax is sent to the server(stripe payment gateway) to delete the card thsi does take a few seconds
[16:49:54] <taplar> lol
[16:50:12] <simonsaysdiaf> taplar: u sure? i havnt tried
[16:50:17] <taplar> 99.99999 sure
[16:50:25] <taplar> iframe isn't a node on the page
[16:50:26] <simonsaysdiaf> could be right
[16:50:32] <simonsaysdiaf> hmm
[16:50:33] <simonsaysdiaf> true
[16:51:30] <taplar> if (window.location.href !== window.top.location.href) $('body'.addClass('iframeView');
[16:51:36] <taplar> then base your styles off of iframeView
[16:51:52] <simonsaysdiaf> ^^^^that will work
[16:51:55] <taplar> iirc that conditional is what people used to use to know when to break out of iframes
[16:52:11] <taplar> missed a closing ) on the body
[16:59:04] <ircbaako> anyone pleasae
[17:00:24] <taplar> your wanting to safe guard multi clicks?
[17:01:41] <taplar> your fiddle isn't working... and it's strange that your delegating on the same thing that your filtering on
[17:02:32] <ircbaako> taplar, https://jsfiddle.net/baako/utp58atd/3/
[17:03:14] <ircbaako> try 4
[17:03:15] <ircbaako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/utp58atd/4/
[17:05:16] <taplar> ok, so it's not removing them still.  but i assume that when they click remove the card slider for that card should be removed entirely?
[17:05:52] <ircbaako> taplar, yea
[17:06:09] <taplar> ok, personally, i'd directly bind on the buttons then, using one()
[17:06:11] <ircbaako> the element holding the details should be remove completely
[17:07:35] <ircbaako> taplar, what do you mean plz
[17:07:55] <taplar> one() is like on(), except it unbinds after the first event
[17:08:06] <taplar> so you avoid the possibility of double processing
[17:08:43] <taplar> you wouldn't want to do it with a delegate in this case, as you want it to keep working for the other things
[17:11:05] <ircbaako> i need the delegate
[17:13:35] <taplar> then your going to have to come up with a way to know that it's in the process of removing a card, check it, and don't continue if so
[17:15:38] <taplar> heh, or do this https://jsfiddle.net/utp58atd/6/
[17:15:51] <ircbaako> you click the remove card button and it remove the element for that button
[17:17:54] <ircbaako> got it working
[17:18:03] <ircbaako> for the grey out bt
[17:18:06] <ircbaako> bit
[17:30:41] <ircbaako> taplar, need your expert view again please
[17:30:42] <ircbaako> https://jsfiddle.net/baako/utp58atd/7/
[17:31:37] <ircbaako> seem to do the job but the doesnt seem to remove the header i tried to wrapped a div around the header and then row class but the structure of it doesnt looks nice
[17:31:42] <ircbaako> due to jquery ui
[17:37:45] <taplar> not sure about that one.  there looks like a refresh option you can give the accordion
[17:49:41] <ircbaako> refresh option?
[17:51:11] <ircbaako> tapout,
[17:51:23] <ircbaako> taplar
[17:55:22] <ircbaako> like a boss https://jsfiddle.net/baako/utp58atd/8/
[18:49:30] <Saint_Is_> HI I'm using jQuery.validate and I keep getting this error on form submission: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined. Exception occurred when checking element inf_field_FirstName, check the 'required,' method.
[19:48:34] <duckgoose> hello
[19:48:39] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[19:48:46] <duckgoose> people in ##javascript are asleep
[19:48:56] <duckgoose> blah( { Testing: {}, Test: {} } );    blah( [ Testing: {}, Test: {} ] );
[19:49:03] <duckgoose> which of those is the better way of doing it
[19:49:24] <robertmaxrees> considering that the second is invalid and you're not giving enough conext, the first one.
[19:52:12] <duckgoose> blah( { Testing: stuff, Test: stuff } );    blah( [ {Testing: stuff}, {Test: stuff}  ] );
[19:52:19] <duckgoose> there, Mr snobby. which one if better
[19:52:20] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.
[19:52:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not being snobby.
[19:52:29] <robertmaxrees> the second one didn't work before.
[19:52:34] <robertmaxrees> will each object largely be the same?
[19:52:46] <robertmaxrees> or are those props all describing the same thing?
[19:53:17] <robertmaxrees> like, are you describing many objects, or just one?
[19:53:54] <duckgoose> different objects with same properties
[19:54:03] <robertmaxrees> then the array.
[19:54:19] <duckgoose> kbye
[19:54:30] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[20:24:15] <muley> lol
[21:23:15] <mp86> hey guys, $(window).on('load', function() { .... }) should ALWAYS fire at some point right?
[21:23:46] <mp86> i.e. if you have that function call AFTER the window has loaded, it should still fire right?
[23:51:53] <aro> i am having an issue - i have a function that is called to return an array of values - in that function is an $.ajax function which returns the values (obviously since that has its own scope - its not returning the values anywhere) how do i get it to return those to the calling method?
[23:58:15] <systemfault> aro: Learn async programming.
[23:58:31] <systemfault> aro: You cannot "return", it's just that the program continues from that callback
