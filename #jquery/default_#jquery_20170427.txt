[00:02:10] <WhirledPress> Does the click event happen after you finished dragging something?
[00:07:22] <ngharo> i think so
[00:07:38] <ngharo> click is mousedown -> mouseup -> click
[00:07:40] <ngharo> iirc
[00:08:21] <WhirledPress> yeah. I'm just trying to decide if I need to handle the click event to distinguish between a click and a drag
[00:09:04] <WhirledPress> on mouse down, I set a state variable to down and setup a timer to check if still down. If so, I start dragging
[00:10:35] <ngharo> oh i see
[00:10:49] <ngharo> welp easy enough to test, right
[01:58:15] <Cork> WhirledPress, ngharo: sadly that isn't true
[01:58:20] <Cork> it depends on the os
[01:58:37] <Cork> i think on mac click happens on mousedown (if i don't remember wrong)
[01:58:56] <Cork> so you can't assume the event orders
[01:58:59] <ngharo> well, that's shitty!
[01:59:22] <ngharo> you'd think there was some governing body that would define that behavior *smirks*
[01:59:29] <Cork> :)
[03:41:26] <WhirledPress> is it better to do this: var lnks=$("nav a"); lnks.filter(".current").removeClass("current"); lnk.eq(x).addClass("current");      or just lnks.removeClass("current"); lnk.eq(x).addClass("current");
[03:42:24] <Cork> WhirledPress: the later is the most efficient one
[03:42:50] <Cork> though you can change it to $('nav a').removeClass('current').eq(x).addClass('current')
[03:44:18] <Cork> if you have a really big set of elements $('nav a.current').removeClass('current'); $('nav a'(
[03:44:21] <Cork> opps
[03:44:37] <Cork> if you have a really big set of elements $('nav a.current').removeClass('current'); $('nav a').eq(x).addClass('current') might be more efficient
[03:44:46] <Cork> but normally it isn't
[03:45:33] <Cork> (filter and removeClass loops over the elements and isn't using selectors)
[03:45:45] <Cork> but normally that is actually the most efficient
[03:55:01] <WhirledPress> https://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/p2wo4zyp/
[03:55:17] <WhirledPress> sry need to add the html...
[04:23:41] <Sircle> I am getting {"type":"webpackOk"} or {"isTrusted":true} for event.data in iframe.contentWindow.postMessage('The message to send.','http://localhost:8080/');   What can be wronge? https://pastebin.mozilla.org/9020070
[04:25:05] <Cork> Sircle: are you developing an extension?
[04:25:18] <Sircle> Cork:  no
[04:25:30] <Sircle> Cork:  just want to pass message to iframe
[04:26:24] <Cork> well there is a bit too little context in that pb to tell, but it might be you aren't waiting for the iframe to load
[04:27:42] <Cork> Sircle: also event isn't the data you sent in the message event
[04:27:48] <Cork> it is the messageevent object
[04:27:57] <Cork> you want event.data if you want the text
[04:28:57] <Sircle> Cork:  for event.data I get {"type":"webpackOk"}
[04:30:07] <Cork> hmm shouldn't be...
[04:31:35] <Cork> ah looks like it is webpack messing with you
[04:31:43] <Cork> not sure what the solution for that is though
[04:52:08] <WhirledPress> https://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/XRKRbo?editors=1111
[04:52:53] <WhirledPress> my completely original and most-likely whacked out way to handle "current" menu items based on scroll position.
[05:35:43] <Cork> WhirledPress: $('nam
[05:35:44] <Cork> opps
[05:36:24] <Cork> WhirledPress: $('nav').on('click', function(e) {}) should be replaced with $('nav').on('click', 'a', function(e) {})
[05:36:48] <Cork> the current solution will accept clicks that isn't on a link and will then break
[05:37:07] <Cork> that also means lnk=$(e.target); can be replaced with lnk=$(this);
[05:37:58] <WhirledPress> and that still binds to the nav element, not the links so I can add links later without reassigning the handler?
[05:38:00] <Cork> also not sure why but your scroll animation doesn't work
[05:38:13] <Cork> WhirledPress: that is explicitly what delegation is for ya
[05:39:05] <WhirledPress> I thought the selector you suggested still bound to the ancho elements. Thanks. Now I know
[05:39:24] <Cork> $() <-- element it binds to .on() <-- method called on that element
[05:39:29] <Cork> 'click' action, 'a
[05:39:41] <Cork> 'click' action, 'a' <-- selector argument passed to the on function
[05:39:59] <Cork> the syntax is explicitly to make it clear what you are binding on
[05:40:13] <Cork> (compared to the old .live)
[05:40:43] <WhirledPress> What is the alternate syntax for $('.class')....I see it every once in a while..
[05:41:30] <Cork> alternative?
[05:41:32] <Cork> there isn't one
[05:41:58] <Cork> if you mean attribute selectors that is [class=""], but not that is NOT a class selector
[05:42:22] <Cork> *but note*
[05:42:23] <WhirledPress> is there another way to $(".upper .lower") ?
[05:42:46] <Cork> $('.upper').find('.lower')=
[05:42:47] <Cork> *?
[05:42:52] <Cork> man fat fingers...
[06:02:13] <WhirledPress> so $("#sect1").add("#link1").siblings('.current')   will give me all of the siblings for both #sect1 and #link1 that have class current?
[06:04:15] <WhirledPress> boy is this ugly, but should work:   lnk.add(art).siblings('.current').removeClass("current").end().addClass("current");
[07:29:51] <Jungle_Jim> Hi All. I have a date question. I have an input that is being filled in like '27 Apr 2017' and I want to autofill the next field with '26 Apr 2020' My question is what is the best way to split the value and add the 3 years ?
[07:38:03] <Cork> Jungle_Jim: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#utility-parseDate
[08:04:03] <Jungle_Jim> Cork, thx... looking at that link now
[08:11:30] <ph88> hey guys what's  the structure css file in jquery ui? do i still need it when i use the main css file ?
[08:12:07] <Cork> ph88: "the main"?
[08:12:20] <Cork> the structure css is needed for jquery ui to work at all
[08:12:34] <Cork> ontop of that is either a theme loaded, or you load your own style
[10:15:16] <dfch> hi jquery, not sure if it is the right place to ask, but gonna try my luck anyway, here's a log tailer (example at http://habitat.habhub.org/logtail/ ) project at github https://github.com/ukhas/js-logtail/ , so my question is it possible to fadeIn new lines and word-warp output?
[10:21:34] <Cork> dfch: no, it adds text lines in a single element
[10:21:42] <Cork> it can't animate those
[10:22:06] <Cork> about wrapping, sure just set white-space: prewrap on the element in css
[10:22:29] <dfch> thanks Cork !
[10:22:33] <Cork> opps white-space: pre-wrap; nothing else
[10:23:16] <Cork> dfch: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space#Values
[10:23:29] <Cork> you most likely have white-space: nowrap; on that element right now
[10:27:20] <dfch> <------>overflow: hidden;
[10:27:21] <dfch> <------>white-space: pre-warp;
[10:27:28] <dfch> and nope :(
[10:27:56] <Cork> wrap, not warp
[10:28:10] <dfch> oh >_<
[10:28:24] <dfch> warp drive active, lol
[10:28:25] <dfch> thanks
[10:28:57] <dfch> Yes, working perfectly fine now
[10:29:29] <dfch> so no way to animate?
[10:29:45] <Cork> not while using that lib no
[10:29:52] <Cork> you need elements to fade
[10:30:05] <Cork> you could possibly modify it to type out the characters
[10:30:16] <Cork> but that isn't really animation
[10:30:47] <dfch> any hints where should i look then?
[10:31:48] <Cork> can't say i do no, i would just write it from scratch
[10:32:23] <dfch> well many thanks anyway Cork
[10:32:28] <Cork> an option would be to patch the "show_log" section and have it add spans around the lines it adds or something like that
[10:32:32] <Cork> np
[10:33:01] <dfch> oh thats a start for me! :)
[10:33:29] <Cork> ya, the lib is quite simple so shouldn't be too hard to modify
[10:34:50] <dfch> for someone who touched jquery (and js in general) for the first time it can be quite challenging, although fun to discover new stuff
[11:09:51] <relipse__> Is there a way to make a submit handler check if another submit handler had event.preventDefault(); in it?
[12:25:56] <GoSox> is there an event that triggers on both keyup and keydown?
[12:26:11] <robertmaxrees> could try input.
[12:28:22] <GoSox> i can't seem to find an input event in jquery?
[12:28:30] <robertmaxrees> it's a native dom event.
[12:28:36] <robertmaxrees> .on('input', functionm() {});
[12:28:39] <robertmaxrees> *function
[12:28:43] <GoSox> hrm
[12:29:02] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:30:25] <GoSox> it works quite well in newest safari, i wonder how well in everything else, time to fire up the virtual machines
[12:30:32] <robertmaxrees> no need heh
[12:30:51] <GoSox> it works everywhere?
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/UTqgXAY.png
[12:31:19] <robertmaxrees> mdn has tables that show you support for things.
[12:31:20] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[12:31:29] <robertmaxrees> at the bottom.  IE9 and above.
[12:31:39] <robertmaxrees> with some minor caveats
[12:33:03] <GoSox> ok in IE9 it doesn't fire when you hit delete
[12:33:11] <GoSox> thats not so minor
[12:33:31] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out what tools you've got available.
[12:33:58] <GoSox> IE10 doesn't have that bug
[12:33:59] <robertmaxrees> why is keyup not enough in your case?
[12:34:21] <GoSox> it just makes for a nicer user experience if its even more instant than keyup
[12:34:23] <GoSox> aka keydown
[12:34:31] <GoSox> but i also want it to work when pasting in etc
[12:34:46] <GoSox> but if possible, i want all of that in one event handler
[12:35:02] <robertmaxrees> we use keyup in those cases and it works just fine.
[12:35:46] <GoSox> well keyup wasn't catching pasting, but also the lag is noticable if you are processing input in real time, using keydown vs keyup
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> how are you processing it?
[12:36:23] <robertmaxrees> 'cause normally you want to throttle/debnounce ajax stuff in those cases anyway,.
[12:36:40] <GoSox> this is all on the page, no http requests
[12:36:49] <GoSox> i'm just changing up some text on the page based on whats being entered
[12:36:53] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[12:37:15] <GoSox> looks like the only big with 'input' is the delete key on IE9 so ill probably just stick to input
[12:38:01] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/html-characters/
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:38:24] <GoSox> the "Custom Code" input is what i'm working on. just tweaking it
[12:41:17] <Jungle_Jim> Cork,  You got a minute to look at my date issue.  I've put it up on jsfiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/g9a6qqq5/  It works for current dates, even 1 Mar 2017 but when I enter 23 Jan 2017 it fails - for the life of me I can't figure out why??
[12:45:48] <phelix> https://pastebin.com/6U8XfQaC I can not for the life of me figure out why this isn't adding a day to the time for the calendar. I can view the console log and it shows that its 1 day ahead of what was selected from the first calendar. And the functionality works as it won't let me select a date earlier than the first selected date. But it won't do it by a single day. What could I be missing?
[12:56:27] <robertmaxrees> phelix can you make that into a fiddle?
[12:56:54] <phelix> robertmaxrees: Thanks for the response. I just got it working. Stupid mistake.
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[12:57:30] <phelix> endDate.datepicker('option','minDate', selected)
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[12:57:37] <phelix> selected needed to be replaced with minDate
[12:58:01] <phelix> should have been endDate.datepicker('option','minDate', minDate)
[12:58:13] <robertmaxrees> glad you figured it out.
[12:58:31] <phelix> thanks for always being willing to help out!
[12:58:35] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[12:58:40] <robertmaxrees> s'why we're heree.
[13:00:22] <Jungle_Jim> Hi all, I can't for the life of me figure out why this date calculation fails. I have a date and then I want to set an expires date 1, 2 or three years from now.   I've put it up on jsfiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/g9a6qqq5/  It works for current dates, even 1 Mar 2017 but when I enter 23 Jan 2017 it fails when selecting 3 years
[13:01:16] <Jungle_Jim> So for 23 Jan 2017, the expires date should be 22 Jan 2017
[13:01:43] <GoSox> robertmaxrees: that page i linked you to a few minutes ago... turns out i can literally type a script tag and some script right into it... rut roh
[13:02:12] <robertmaxrees> GoSox you're not storing that anywhere, yeah?
[13:02:22] <GoSox> nope
[13:02:42] <GoSox> you're typing entity codes so i should be able to filter out all symbols easy enough
[13:02:57] <robertmaxrees> and users can't like... hotlink to a version of the page where they can specify the contents of that field, too, right?
[13:03:26] <GoSox> i don't know of any way they could do that
[13:04:24] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.  might still be cool to clean that up, but i wouldn't worry too much.
[13:04:35] <Deusdeorum> How can I pick items from an dict? I try to update a new dict based on another dict when clicking an item: https://jsfiddle.net/c5dun50e/
[13:05:06] <robertmaxrees> Jungle_Jim https://i.imgur.com/zoO5LzX.png
[13:05:11] <robertmaxrees> is this not what i should be seeing?
[13:05:31] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum well first of all, that's not a dict.
[13:05:42] <Deusdeorum> array, sorry
[13:05:56] <Deusdeorum> object?
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> so you want to update a particular item in the array?
[13:06:25] <robertmaxrees> ah, you want the object whose product key is the class.
[13:06:26] <Deusdeorum> basically i just want to build a new array, but picking the items from the first array
[13:06:29] <Deusdeorum> ye
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[13:06:45] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid using "class" for this.
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> because you quickly run into the issue where you have multiple classes on an element and then this falls apart.
[13:07:48] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees,, Put in todays date and select 3 years - that's the "correct" answer i.e. 3 years from now mminus 1 day
[13:08:26] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees true, but if just bypass that part, my real env does not exactly look like this but is pretty close
[13:08:54] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum so the next thing is you really want to use Array.prototype.filter() :)  lemme show you.
[13:09:29] <Deusdeorum> Well, i am trying to do that, but somewhere I fail, i need to remove the item from the array if clicked again :D
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> so for starters
[13:10:56] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5dun50e/1/
[13:11:42] <robertmaxrees> so can a user only ever select a product once?
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> like, is it a toggle of sorts, or can they optionally add or remove it?
[13:12:49] <Deusdeorum> If they select they can unselect, i.e if select, add to array, if unselect, remove from array
[13:13:01] <robertmaxrees> so it's a toggle?
[13:13:21] <robertmaxrees> Jungle_Jim aaaah
[13:14:17] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees not sure what a toggle is, but that's what i tried building with my if statement, .inArray if in array remove it if not add it, but failed
[13:14:27] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, I'm guessing the "aaaah" means you figured out the issue
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum that would be a toggle.
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> Jungle_Jim nah - i finally understood it haha
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> Jungle_Jim i'ma be honest and highly suggest that you look into using moment.js for date stuff.
[13:15:09] <robertmaxrees> i know it sounds like "just another library", but it really makes stuff like this waaaaay easier.
[13:16:12] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, Problem is I can't add another library - long story.
[13:16:28] <robertmaxrees> humm.
[13:16:40] <MikeD_1> even if you can't add the library, you can read code for "how do they do that?" and them implement something similar(ish)
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> good suggestion MikeD_1
[13:17:05] <robertmaxrees> date math is incredibly hard, which is why i point that out.
[13:19:08] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, I'm finding that out
[13:19:47] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, This just seems like such a simple thing to do - Find the expiry date 3 years on  from now
[13:20:10] <MikeD_> do you care about daylight savings time?
[13:20:19] <robertmaxrees> or leap years?
[13:23:47] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c5dun50e/3/
[13:24:29] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees is my approach worse (not working yet) https://jsfiddle.net/c5dun50e/4/
[13:25:16] <robertmaxrees> well.
[13:25:23] <jqueryQ> Do you decide is async is right based on if the site is HTTP 1.1.? HTTP/2
[13:25:38] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQ newp.
[13:25:49] <jqueryQ> that a nope? :D
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum ignoring that this wouldn't work for obvious reasons, it's very similar./
[13:26:01] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQ yeah - that's kind of a strange question.
[13:26:06] <robertmaxrees> why do you askl?
[13:26:08] <robertmaxrees> *ask
[13:26:39] <jqueryQ> I'm trying to find out when is it a correct time to use async
[13:26:47] <Deusdeorum> robertmaxrees Okok, thanks mate! but what does this actually return "return currentProduct.product === selectedProductID;" ln 38
[13:26:50] <Deusdeorum> bool?
[13:26:55] <robertmaxrees> ... when the method is async jqueryQ
[13:26:59] <jqueryQ> and was wondering if http1/2 had anything to do with that as well
[13:27:07] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQ are you talking about ajax?
[13:27:08] <robertmaxrees> or....?
[13:27:17] <robertmaxrees> Deusdeorum yep.
[13:27:34] <Deusdeorum> a lot nice than .inArray then.. thank you
[13:29:23] <jqueryQ> robertmaxrees no that was the question, i just myself didnt know how to answer it either lmao
[13:29:33] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQ the question itself is... really strange.
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:30:10] <jqueryQ> I think its coming from a person with not too much technical background, but enough to know slight differences
[13:30:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  generally you don't think of it in terms of "i'm going to make this async" unless you're getting into handling things like ajax.
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> but lots of stuff (like DOM manipulation) doesn't give you that kind of choice.
[13:41:07] <Kartagis> (note to self: if some jquery is not working on file but working on the console, blame it on DOM not being ready)
[14:19:27] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, I solved it!! Whoop whoop - calculated it a bit differently - here is the working version https://jsfiddle.net/wavesailor/g9a6qqq5/
[14:20:21] <robertmaxrees> Jungle_Jim btw you know you don't need to use firebug lite, yeah?
[14:20:28] <robertmaxrees> btw grats
[14:21:17] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, I used firebug lite to get the console output ....  is there a better way??
[14:21:42] <robertmaxrees> your browser has that built in.
[14:27:02] <Jungle_Jim> robertmaxrees, but not JSFiddle :-P
[14:27:54] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:28:06] <robertmaxrees> firebug lite is also kind of buggy and funky.
[15:45:32] <hellyeah> what is the jquery version that meets Ecma Script 6 new features?
[16:32:32] <robertmaxrees> sometimes people ask questions that make me scratch my head.
[16:36:03] <taplar_> yup
[16:51:38] <robertmaxrees> how's it going taplar_
[17:03:45] <chrispg21> is there a way to get around an input field keyup event thats got preventDefault and stopPropagation previously declared?
[17:03:59] <chrispg21> i want to listen for keyup in my own script
[17:04:13] <robertmaxrees> "get around"?  not really.
[17:04:23] <robertmaxrees> are they being stopped by a plugin or something?
[17:04:39] <chrispg21> yes another script is stopping them
[17:04:46] <robertmaxrees> is it a plugin?
[17:04:54] <chrispg21> the script that creates the element
[17:05:03] <chrispg21> its in WordPress core
[17:05:04] * taplar_ can't wait for his deadline to be past
[17:05:06] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:05:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not really.  but I'
[17:05:21] <robertmaxrees> *i'd see if there's a way to hook in your own callbacks.
[17:06:17] <chrispg21> seems pretty sealed off unfortunalty
[17:06:28] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[17:15:33] <dandymcgee> hello
[17:15:41] <robertmaxrees> hola
[17:16:08] <dandymcgee> need help tracking a major perf issue being triggered somewhere deep in jQuery
[17:16:19] <dandymcgee> any takers?
[17:16:34] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel and if anybody can chip in, they will :)
[17:17:01] <dandymcgee> more specifically, forced reflows being triggered by curCSS()
[17:17:30] <robertmaxrees> got a test case?
[17:17:38] <dandymcgee> unfortunately not
[17:17:50] <dandymcgee> if i knew how to isolate the problem it wouldn't be a problem anymore :)
[17:17:53] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code you've got?
[17:18:24] <dandymcgee> it's a very large, proprietary project, so not in its entirety.. again unfortunately
[17:18:35] <robertmaxrees> we wouldn't want to see all of it.
[17:18:47] <robertmaxrees> we'd want to see your code that calls the jquery that's goit the issue.
[17:18:57] <robertmaxrees> gotta give us something to work with :)
[17:19:16] <dandymcgee> aye, let's figure out what that is
[17:19:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?  how'd you confirm that it's jquery in the first place then?
[17:20:09] <dandymcgee> chrome dev tools
[17:20:31] <dandymcgee> i'm sure my code / css / javascript is at fault, but the actual reflow is being triggered by something jQuery does
[17:21:16] <dandymcgee> https://pastebin.com/HC5gFrcw
[17:21:24] <dandymcgee> that is the calling code
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm./
[17:22:38] <dandymcgee> there are ~8 summary sections, but one in particular is a large table which is causing hundreds of forced reflows via jQuery's curCSS() for each cell of the table
[17:23:09] <robertmaxrees> via $(element).append('<p class="perf">[' + parseInt(performance.now() - t0) + ' ms] client (request -> deserialize -> render)<br />    ' + actionUrl + '</p>'); ?
[17:24:09] <robertmaxrees> like, if you comment that out things don't slow down, right?
[17:24:25] <dandymcgee> good question, let's find out
[17:25:16] <dandymcgee> i doubt the append is the problem though, that's only appending a single paragraph
[17:25:22] <dandymcgee> it's more likely the .load()
[17:25:24] <dandymcgee> testing it ...
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> erm./
[17:25:49] <robertmaxrees> .load() just runs an ajax call.
[17:26:32] <dandymcgee> not according to the docs
[17:26:35] <dandymcgee> "When a successful response is detected (i.e. when textStatus is "success" or "notmodified"), .load() sets the HTML contents of the matched element to the returned data."
[17:26:49] <dandymcgee> it sets HTML after the async call completes
[17:26:50] <robertmaxrees> ah that portion.
[17:26:53] <dandymcgee> which causes reflows
[17:26:57] <dandymcgee> (potentially)
[17:27:32] <dandymcgee> it's async loading some HTML directly into the page
[17:27:35] <taplar_> is the response from the load containing any <script> or <style> blocks?
[17:28:20] <robertmaxrees> the quick and dirty test would be to detach the element first, do the load against the detatched one, then append it into the page.
[17:28:26] <dandymcgee> no <style> blocks, one <script> block
[17:28:42] <taplar_> so the load is going to perform an eval on that
[17:29:00] <robertmaxrees> his issue is curCSS though.
[17:29:23] <taplar_> just curious if a global eval or something is doing work that is doing multiple css manips
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.  the contents of the script tag?
[17:29:40] <taplar_> ya
[17:29:46] <robertmaxrees> good point.
[17:29:50] <dandymcgee> oh, that could be the case
[17:29:51] <taplar_> is the content of the <script> the same for every one of them?
[17:29:55] <dandymcgee> yes
[17:30:03] <dandymcgee> hmm, excellent thought
[17:30:06] <taplar_> why not load that on the page ahead of time?
[17:30:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:30:16] <taplar_> and put it in a funciton if it need to be repeated
[17:30:25] <dandymcgee> well it's not the same for every one, sorry
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> what's changing?
[17:30:38] <taplar_> possibly contextualize it with the function
[17:30:44] <robertmaxrees> could you abstract that out and pass in an arg to handle the same job?
[17:30:49] <taplar_> ^
[17:31:02] <dandymcgee> https://pastebin.com/ndPXPUd6
[17:31:17] <dandymcgee> the "PopupID" varies each time
[17:31:32] <robertmaxrees> there it is hahahhaa
[17:31:35] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can abstract that out.
[17:31:52] <dandymcgee> hmm how would i do that?
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> $('#' + popupID)
[17:32:11] <robertmaxrees> OR use a class instead.
[17:32:15] <taplar_> would it be a performance boost to do them all at the end?
[17:32:26] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[17:32:29] <taplar_> guess it depends on the plugin
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> looks like there's only a handful of them tho.
[17:32:36] <dandymcgee> why would separating the ID from the '#' matter?
[17:32:51] <robertmaxrees> dandymcgee that way you can abstract this to a function and call that in your code.
[17:32:56] <robertmaxrees> instead of generating js server-side.
[17:32:59] <robertmaxrees> which is a good thing to avoid.
[17:33:12] <robertmaxrees> try commenting this script tag out of the stuff getting loaded in.
[17:33:16] <robertmaxrees> does that speed things up?
[17:36:33] <dandymcgee> it does, reflows are gone
[17:36:57] <robertmaxrees> there you go then.
[17:36:57] <dandymcgee> i'm not sure how i would refactor it out though, what do you mean "to a function"? is popup() not already a function?
[17:37:11] <robertmaxrees> the init itself.
[17:37:32] <robertmaxrees> you wanna get out out of the template, so you genericise it into a function.
[17:37:38] <robertmaxrees> or just give those popups a class instead.
[17:37:40] <robertmaxrees> and init on that.
[17:37:53] <dandymcgee> i don't understand what that means, sorry :/
[17:38:09] <dandymcgee> i'm a C programmer :P
[17:38:21] <cannap> lol
[17:38:29] <robertmaxrees> soi instead of $('#@(Model.PopupID)') it'd be $('.whateverclassnamehere')
[17:38:43] <dandymcgee> how would i know the id then?
[17:38:46] <robertmaxrees> and then you'd put class="whateverclassnamehere" on your html.
[17:38:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the ID any more.
[17:38:58] <dandymcgee> the id is what decides which popup to show
[17:39:04] <robertmaxrees> is the ID required?
[17:39:17] <dandymcgee> yes, it tells popup() which popup to display
[17:39:23] <robertmaxrees> which plugin library are you using?
[17:39:40] <taplar_> by that snipplet, i don't see that
[17:39:43] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:39:46] <taplar_> it's just using the id for the select
[17:39:50] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:39:55] <robertmaxrees> you could just as easily use a class instead.
[17:40:05] <dandymcgee> it would have to be a unique class
[17:40:09] <dandymcgee> sec, let me find context
[17:40:12] <taplar_> why?
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> err
[17:40:12] <robertmaxrees> what?
[17:40:38] <robertmaxrees> you'd just make sure only those elements have the class.  mind tossing out a link to the docs for this plugin?
[17:40:38] <taplar_> $(selector).popup() <-- selector there doesn't tell popup which one to show.  it finds the elements that it will run the popup initialization on
[17:40:44] <taplar_> that selector can be 'anything'
[17:40:51] <dandymcgee> i don't have a link, dunno where i found it can't remember, gimme a sec
[17:41:04] <dandymcgee> it's a weird way it's architected, lemme pastebin relevant parts
[17:41:29] <taplar_> nothing says you have to remove the id if you change it to use the class for selecting
[17:41:49] <taplar_> you just select by the class.  if the popup uses the id for anything, it would still be on the element
[17:41:50] <dandymcgee> hmm i think i see what you're saying actually
[17:41:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:42:01] <dandymcgee> but you have to call popup()
[17:42:08] <dandymcgee> on the element itself
[17:42:10] <taplar_> to initialize
[17:42:14] <dandymcgee> right
[17:42:19] <dandymcgee> how would i refactor that?
[17:42:28] <robertmaxrees> $('.someClass').popup({
[17:42:32] <robertmaxrees> that's your new first line.
[17:42:44] <dandymcgee> oh..
[17:42:48] <dandymcgee> i'm slowly getting there haha
[17:42:51] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:42:52] <dandymcgee> seeing where you're going with this
[17:43:10] <dandymcgee> like i said.. don't do much JS/CSS work so it's hard to wrap my head around
[17:43:16] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[17:43:30] <dandymcgee> so where do i initialize?
[17:43:34] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com is a solid primer that you'd probably grok pretty quick.
[17:43:55] <robertmaxrees> sec
[17:44:04] <dandymcgee> eh, i know the basics it's just optimizing / refactoring that i have to think about in new ways
[17:44:17] <dandymcgee> i need experience, not a tutorial ;)
[17:44:18] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[17:44:22] <dandymcgee> 3.1.1 i believe
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:44:39] <dandymcgee> that's the latest thing on NuGet
[17:45:07] <robertmaxrees> i'ma show you something kinda batty
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> gimme a few
[17:45:37] <dandymcgee> mmk
[17:45:57] <Ice_Strike> How would you create hidden template of <tr> <td> .. </td> </tr> ?
[17:46:05] <Ice_Strike> I am thinking putting in script
[17:46:14] <Ice_Strike> or in <table> but hidden
[17:46:25] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike are you going to be doing a lot of templating?
[17:46:31] <Ice_Strike> No
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/1ed36e972fe6 dandymcgee
[17:48:13] <robertmaxrees> completely untested but the basic idea is there.
[17:48:34] <dandymcgee> hah
[17:48:37] <dandymcgee> that's exactly where i put it
[17:48:53] <dandymcgee> solved the problem! you're my hero robert
[17:49:00] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:06] <robertmaxrees> so you did the the important bit is the $.when.apply($, allAjaxCalls).then(function() { ?
[17:49:08] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[17:49:33] <robertmaxrees> hopefully that question made sense.
[17:50:02] <dandymcgee> i didn't any of the fancy stuff, just copy/paste
[17:50:08] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:50:14] <dandymcgee> so what's all this .apply / .map / etc. do?
[17:50:23] <robertmaxrees> you have to do some of the fancy stuff, otherwise the popups will initialize before the contents actually on the page.
[17:50:34] <robertmaxrees> unless those popups aren't brought in via the load.
[17:50:58] <dandymcgee> probably true, not against it, just rushed to my own similar (but worse) solution out of excitement before you posted yours ;)
[17:51:25] <robertmaxrees> so .map() basically returns an array - the .get() is a thing to "convert" it to a normal js array instead of a jquery array.
[17:51:36] <dandymcgee> hey whadya know, none of my pop-ups work lmao
[17:51:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:52:28] <robertmaxrees> .apply() gives you a way to take an array and pass each index as an argument.
[17:52:41] <taplar_> that snipplet had get(0) on it
[17:52:48] <robertmaxrees> oh it does.
[17:52:51] <robertmaxrees> my bad.,
[17:53:12] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/02614106036e
[17:53:44] <dandymcgee> uhh
[17:53:46] <dandymcgee> you removed .load()
[17:53:50] <dandymcgee> and now nothing gets loaded at all :P
[17:54:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  just trying to give you the basic idea.
[17:54:21] <dandymcgee> oo, he's a tricky one!
[17:54:45] <robertmaxrees> the .then() is where you'd pop that stuff.
[17:54:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of using .load9)
[17:54:49] <robertmaxrees> *( ()
[17:54:54] <robertmaxrees> ffff hahahaha
[17:55:22] <dandymcgee> so i can replace .then() with .load() or..?
[17:55:49] <robertmaxrees> nah - i'd explicitly do the replace yourself.
[17:56:13] <dandymcgee> like $(element).html(response); ?
[17:56:13] <robertmaxrees> err, append
[17:56:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah yours works.
[17:57:02] <dandymcgee> it still just never loads anything
[17:57:04] <dandymcgee> hmm..
[17:57:25] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab?
[17:58:18] <dandymcgee> the requests are made, but the response body is never loaded into the page
[17:58:55] <dandymcgee> is "response" the HTML or some object?
[17:58:57] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/e2d826a30844
[17:59:00] <dandymcgee> gotta look up the docs
[17:59:07] <robertmaxrees> response is a string.
[17:59:28] <robertmaxrees> so if your server returned html, it's a string of html.  which you can use .html() / .append() etc on.,
[17:59:32] <Ice_Strike> Why do this not work? $('td:first-child', rowTemplate).html('hello');
[17:59:51] <taplar_> what is rowTemplate?
[17:59:58] <robertmaxrees> is it unemployed?
[18:00:08] <taplar_> lmao
[18:00:14] <taplar_> wow, that took me a few seconds
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> D:
[18:00:23] <robertmaxrees> * :D
[18:00:33] <taplar_> i'm diss tracted
[18:01:55] <dandymcgee> this is not working at all lol, no idea why
[18:02:45] <robertmaxrees> does it ever reach the .then() ?
[18:02:50] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/7gppyh18/
[18:03:11] <Ice_Strike> For some reason, it did not modifty dom td to hello
[18:03:52] <robertmaxrees> context can't be a string Ice_Strike2
[18:03:52] <taplar_> rowTemplate isn't an Element.  it's a string
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:04:03] <Ice_Strike> Oh
[18:04:37] <taplar_> var rowTemplate = $($('#feature-row-template').html());
[18:04:58] <Ice_Strike> That work, thanks :)
[18:07:53] <dandymcgee> your code is really broken robert lol
[18:08:10] <robertmaxrees> aaaand like I said, untested.
[18:08:12] <robertmaxrees> general idea.
[18:08:14] <robertmaxrees> etc :)
[18:08:17] <dandymcgee> the thought was genuine but none of the ideas play well together
[18:08:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:08:28] <robertmaxrees> i do stuff like that all the time sooooo.
[18:08:44] <dandymcgee> yeah.. but i don't
[18:08:46] <dandymcgee> so i have no idea how to fix it
[18:08:48] <dandymcgee> lol
[18:09:06] <robertmaxrees> the issue is that you need a way to wait for all of the ajax calls to finish before trying to init.
[18:09:06] <phelix> https://pastebin.com/gW52wUhe This is what my code looks like and it works fine. However. There are 5 different forms and the start and end date all have different selectors, but all forms load on the same page. What is the best way to use this code for all of the calendars on this page without having to duplicate this code 5 times?
[18:09:47] <dandymcgee> the problem is this line:
[18:09:49] <dandymcgee> theAjaxCall.then(function (reponse, status, xhr) {
[18:10:07] <dandymcgee> those params are for a .load() callback, and it's not using .load() anymore
[18:10:16] <robertmaxrees> good catch
[18:10:17] <dandymcgee> i'm not sure what .then() is supposed to take
[18:10:21] <dandymcgee> or how it gets the ajax response body
[18:10:26] <robertmaxrees> sec
[18:10:47] <robertmaxrees> actually.
[18:11:02] <robertmaxrees> it's the same method signature
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> jqXHR.then(function( data, textStatus, jqXHR ) {}, function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {});
[18:11:13] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[18:11:38] <robertmaxrees> did you set a breakpoint inside that and confirm it's never getting there?
[18:12:33] <dandymcgee> it does get there
[18:12:40] <dandymcgee> but it says "response does not exist"
[18:12:48] <dandymcgee> wtf.. it's spelled wrong
[18:12:49] <dandymcgee> FML
[18:13:00] <robertmaxrees> hah
[18:13:18] <dandymcgee> it didn't matter before because with .load() i never had to reference it
[18:13:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[18:16:53] <dandymcgee> thanks a million robert
[18:17:00] <robertmaxrees> that work out for you?
[18:17:03] <dandymcgee> you can be damn certain your username is going in the source code as "special thanks" :P
[18:17:23] <robertmaxrees> hah - and then they'll know who to yell at for later ;)
[18:17:30] <dandymcgee> it did, yeah. still a lot of work to do but that helps out a whole lot
[18:18:17] <dandymcgee> pfft, don't be silly. none of my coworkers know how to connect to an IRC channel. they think you can trace IPs with visual basic GUIs. :D
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:18:44] <dandymcgee> want some warez from my pirate ship while i'm still here?
[18:18:57] <dandymcgee> zzZZzz
[18:19:08] <dandymcgee> seriously though, do appreciate your time!
[18:19:10] <taplar_> please don't offer other visitors a piece of your booty
[18:19:16] <dandymcgee> LOL
[18:19:26] <dandymcgee> i'd taplar that.
[18:19:28] <robertmaxrees> hahah
[18:19:32] <taplar_> i like this guy
[18:19:40] <robertmaxrees> heckuva dude
[18:19:53] <dandymcgee> just don't hire me to write your javascript
[18:20:08] <dandymcgee> although the fact that i care about performance at all probably still puts me ahead haha
[18:20:52] <dandymcgee> "I don't see why twenty second load times are a problem.. just add a dancing cat GIF, problem solved."
[18:20:54] <robertmaxrees> actually, you did The Right Thing™ by not worrying about it until it was a problem.
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[18:21:04] <robertmaxrees> hey man, sometimes those cat gifs save lives.
[18:21:14] <taplar_> it is pawsible
[18:21:20] <dandymcgee> -.-
[18:21:25] <dandymcgee> too far
[18:21:31] <taplar_> lol
[18:21:52] <taplar_> i've offended the cat people.  i'll have to refer to dante's to see where i'm going
[18:22:30] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/ymwdyqd0/
[18:22:39] <Ice_Strike> Why it is showing 1 in the table
[18:22:54] <Ice_Strike> When I check with ajax - it is showing multiple
[18:23:06] <Ice_Strike> Mulitple index
[18:23:08] <robertmaxrees> $('td:first-child', rowTemplate).html(value.name);
[18:23:24] <robertmaxrees> think abhout what that's doinmg.
[18:24:08] <dandymcgee> i'm an hour late to leave work.. so i'm out. have a good <insert local time of day here> everyone!
[18:24:30] <Ice_Strike> yea modifying the dom?
[18:24:52] <Ice_Strike> first child td from template
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> paste in the data tyo that fiddle so we can see it.
[18:26:14] <Ice_Strike> https://bpaste.net/show/00909fa430d8
[18:26:37] <taplar_> which template are you changing?
[18:27:28] <Ice_Strike> rowTemplate
[18:27:34] <taplar_> which ONE?
[18:29:41] <Ice_Strike> I managaged to fix it.
[18:29:47] <Ice_Strike> Which I don't understand why
[18:30:12] <taplar_> append() doesn't duplicate attached Elements.  it will move them
[18:31:00] <taplar_> and you were only creating a single template element
[18:31:28] <Ice_Strike> taplar_ https://jsfiddle.net/tumkqm3w/
[18:31:55] <taplar_> yep, cause you're creating a new template each time now
[18:32:35] <Ice_Strike> But I thought I could reuse the template without creating every time in loop
[18:32:56] <taplar_> no, see what i said about append?
[18:33:16] <Ice_Strike> Ah I see.
[18:33:41] <Ice_Strike> Strange jquery behavour maybe.
[18:34:13] <taplar_> append() as part of it's logic is to clean up after attached elements.  an element can only have a single parent element, since it is a tree
[18:34:24] <taplar_> so it will try to detach the element before it appends it to the new place
[18:35:46] <Ice_Strike> I see, thank you for explaaining
[18:52:23] <robertmaxrees> sooo many tests today
[18:52:37] <taplar_> unit test day?
[18:52:48] <robertmaxrees> kind of.
[18:52:55] <robertmaxrees> catching up on some work we did recently.
[18:53:24] <robertmaxrees> current file coverage was like 32.41
[18:53:30] <taplar_> ouch
[18:53:37] <robertmaxrees> at 54.7 right now.
[18:53:45] <robertmaxrees> fopr statements
[18:54:05] <robertmaxrees> we're slowly getting better about testing.
[18:54:35] <robertmaxrees> but "the business" doesn't like our timelines when we bake that part in.
[18:55:06] <taplar_> yeah, in the past we've set a side an iteration here and there to catch up on technical debt we incurred.
[21:29:56] <Alturic> Hey guys, I'm trying to pass something in an $.ajax post, so I have (wrapped in a .on('click) function), var button = $(this); var buttonid = button.data('id'); and then in the $.ajax I have data: { id: buttonid }, yet the POST is an object? buttonid does return the actual id like I'm expecting, so I'm unsure where the object is coming from?
[22:31:31] <cannap> @Alturic, context problem
[22:31:55] <cannap> data('id') will not give #id
[22:32:07] <cannap> this will give data-id="od"
[22:32:08] <cannap> id
[22:33:12] <cannap> this.id will give the id from the element when it has  #id
[22:33:30] <cannap> and you need var _self = this after the click event
