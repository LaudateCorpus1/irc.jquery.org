[00:00:01] <marcules> Good morning :)
[00:00:30] <Whiskey> morrning marcules
[00:02:20] <greg5green> morning
[00:03:17] <Whiskey> it shuld not diff but it does, and i canÂ´t see why it do that just cuz i add 3 more chars on the lines
[00:04:09] <greg5green> i'm looking at it right now
[00:04:10] <greg5green> thinking
[00:05:48] <Whiskey> You see the problem, that PreTime shuld only have 1 space and not three or whatever it be on it on first example
[00:11:29] <greg5green> functionally, i can make them look the same
[00:11:34] <greg5green> still working on why its actually broken
[00:12:56] <Whiskey> greg5: $(this).css({"width":maxWidth}) on http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/EvXyj/ is 272
[00:13:19] <Whiskey> and $(this).css({"width":maxWidth}) on http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/EvXyj/1/ is 260
[00:13:25] <Whiskey> and 260 is the correct value
[00:13:36] <Whiskey> have no clue why it diffrent when it shuldent
[00:16:57] <prefix> how would I go about getting a resource returned by an API lookup url?
[00:18:13] <tw2113> ajax get request?
[00:18:59] <prefix> how do I capture the return data?
[00:19:42] <prefix> in this case, it should be a URL string
[00:19:51] <tw2113> doesn't it get passed into a success callback handler?
[00:20:04] <prefix> I'm not clear on what that is
[00:20:27] <tw2113> ?ajax
[00:20:33] <tw2113> come on bot, don't fail me
[00:21:04] <bot-t1> jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[00:21:23] <prefix> I get this when I do a get(myurl): XMLHttpRequest cannot load (and then the url)
[00:21:36] <prefix> . Cannot make any requests from null.
[00:21:46] <tw2113> in the settings section, read about the success() function
[00:21:49] <prefix> I just need the returned url string
[00:22:03] <tw2113> ah, you're not getting anything back or so
[00:22:23] <Whiskey> greg5green: You manage to come anywhere?
[00:22:34] <greg5green> yes, i'm almost there
[00:22:35] <greg5green> :)
[00:22:53] <greg5green> well, not necessarily solving, but explaining whats happening
[00:26:56] <prefix> tw2113 I am getting the URL I need in that error message
[00:27:07] <prefix> how can I just grab that URL
[00:29:28] <tw2113> what are you using in your ajax url parameter?
[00:29:45] <prefix> I am simply:
[00:29:46] <prefix> 	var soundcloudstream = $.get(soundcloudstreamrequesturl, function(xhr) {
[00:29:46] <prefix> 		console.log(xhr);
[00:29:46] <prefix> 	});
[00:30:04] <tw2113> and what is this set to? soundcloudstreamrequesturl
[00:30:12] <tw2113> i assume it's a variable holding a valid url
[00:30:15] <prefix> yes
[00:30:20] <prefix> it's an api reuqest
[00:30:30] <tw2113> is it a valid api request url
[00:30:34] <prefix> yes
[00:30:44] <tw2113> have you tested it directly in the browser
[00:30:47] <tw2113> and gotten results
[00:30:49] <prefix> yes
[00:30:56] <prefix> I even get results in the error message
[00:31:08] <tw2113> unsure what's going on
[00:31:10] <prefix> e.g. XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://ak-media.soundcloud.com/sjww7gm16f5m.128.mp3?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ4IAZE5EOI7PA7VQ&Expires=1357720354&Signature=LQmJBJ4aod%2FBdpi%2F0ggWAarRVQk%3D&__gda__=1357720354_36b82b12aac70270bb338b0c239548cb. Cannot make any requests from null.
[00:31:13] <tw2113> something with the request is failing
[00:31:31] <prefix> I just need that exact URL
[00:31:44] <greg5green> Whiskey, the issue is that you are finding the width of only the content in each td
[00:32:22] <Whiskey> well greg5 it shuld use the width from that td whit most content
[00:32:31] <sCoRpi_> Whiskey: check out http://jqueryair.com/
[00:32:32] <greg5green> and it is
[00:32:43] <Whiskey> greg can i pm you?
[00:32:48] <greg5green> which happens to be 244 or 235px
[00:32:49] <greg5green> sure
[00:32:53] <sCoRpi_> Maybe it helps you to udnerstand the basics better :)
[00:32:59] <sCoRpi_> *understand
[00:33:26] <marcules> Do I have to call $(document).ajaxSend(function(e,x,s){}) withing $(document).ready?
[00:33:31] <marcules> -g
[00:34:07] <tw2113> not sure if it helps prefix but i'm getting 403 forbidden errors in firebug
[00:34:28] <tw2113> i created a quick jsbin for it
[00:35:25] <prefix> tw2113 yes, there is a long, complicated reason for that
[00:35:47] <prefix> but basically, the URL changes every 5 minutes
[00:37:10] <tw2113> hmm
[00:37:17] <prefix> so
[00:37:21] <prefix> this one wil work
[00:37:22] <prefix> http://ak-media.soundcloud.com/sjww7gm16f5m.128.mp3?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ4IAZE5EOI7PA7VQ&Expires=1357721046&Signature=BnS5PLIixCDnhOKAK3r%2BWbyTh%2Fs%3D&__gda__=1357721046_118b2c018f76f50dfd2a551694835c0e
[00:37:38] <prefix> because I just requested a new URL
[00:37:42] <tw2113> doesn't help me debug
[00:37:53] <prefix> (this is the expected behavior
[00:37:54] <prefix> )
[00:37:55] <tw2113> basically you're not getting data back
[00:38:04] <prefix> is a URL data?
[00:40:37] <tw2113> no, given the fact that you want audio
[00:41:06] <tw2113> and that's technically just showing you the url that's not working with the request
[00:41:15] <prefix> I actually just need the URL
[00:41:19] <prefix> not even the audio
[00:42:30] <tw2113> then why are you using $.get() at all?
[00:42:36] <prefix> would .load do it?
[00:42:36] <tw2113> you're already constructing the url
[00:43:12] <tw2113> unless something's going completely over my head
[00:43:22] <prefix> hm
[00:43:29] <prefix> one sec. let me test something
[00:46:44] <prefix> ok
[00:48:18] <prefix> if I make an http request with the following, I get access to a mp3: http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/72186759/stream?client_id=mydevkey
[00:48:40] <prefix> I thought I should use .get() to get the mp3 URL
[00:48:46] <prefix> is that not the case?
[00:49:37] <tw2113> not sure
[00:49:47] <tw2113> i don't know their api at all
[00:50:12] <prefix> ok
[00:50:26] <prefix> well trust me, it does return the mp3 URL
[00:50:38] <prefix> I just need to get the URL with jquery
[00:50:59] <tw2113> are you using that url you just pasted for the one you pass into $.get() ?
[00:51:25] <prefix> yes, but with my apikey
[00:51:36] <tw2113> i figured with that part
[00:51:49] <tw2113> it'd be something i'd need to tinker with to come up with any good answer at this point
[00:51:50] <prefix> it works if I enter it into the url bar
[00:52:07] <prefix> would .load() do it?
[00:52:36] <tw2113> dunno: see tinker
[00:52:40] <Cork> prefix: you're doing cross domain calls
[00:52:45] <tw2113> try it and see
[00:52:50] <Cork> that won't really work
[00:53:54] <prefix> http://ak-media.soundcloud.com's base URL is the same as api.soundcloud.com
[00:54:07] <prefix> Cork am I missing something?
[00:54:24] <Cork> base url doesn't matter
[00:54:42] <Cork> protocol and full fqdn is used for cors
[00:54:52] <Cork> s/protocol/port
[00:54:58] <prefix> ok
[00:55:03] <prefix> so, what can I do?
[00:55:20] <Cork> if you're ok with losing ie the server could set a cors header
[00:55:36] <Cork> else you would have to proxy it over the current domain
[00:55:36] <prefix> can't lose ie
[00:55:40] <Cork> or use jsonp
[00:55:43] <prefix> ok
[00:55:47] <Cork> then jsonp or proxy is the only option
[00:56:40] <prefix> jsonp it is
[00:56:42] <prefix> how do?
[00:56:49] <Cork> ?jsonp
[00:57:02] <Cork> damn the bot is dead
[00:57:41] <tw2113> *plays taps*
[00:57:58] <tw2113> night
[00:58:37] <prefix> man
[00:58:43] <Cork> prefix: the server respond with a javascript
[00:58:44] <prefix> I hate soundcloud so much right now
[00:59:10] <Cork> it calls the function that jquery sends in callback like <callback name>(json);
[01:00:16] <Cork> php example: <?php echo $_GET['callback']; ?>(<?php echo json_encode($response); ?>);
[01:01:10] <Cork> prefix: just to possibly save you some time, jsonp can only be get
[01:01:23] <Cork> post, put and so on isn't possible
[01:01:29] <prefix> ok
[01:01:33] <prefix> I think this will work then
[01:01:43] <prefix> I just need to get a URL
[01:02:03] <prefix> basically, I need to issue an api request, and save the returned URL
[01:02:06] <johanhar> is it possible to bind just the <form> and not every <input> for a pressed key?
[01:02:25] <Cork> johanhar: i think keys bubble
[01:02:30] <Cork> not 100% sure though
[01:02:38] <johanhar> can I prevent that?
[01:02:52] <Cork> sure event.stopPropagation();
[01:03:02] <dirkpennings> greg5green: bit late, but I want it for touch indeed.. (see the youtube video).. Am willing to pay for it, cause I don't have time to do it myself (deadline is coming).. if anyone knows something, be my guest :)
[01:03:35] <sCoRpi_> prefix: last resort could be a php tunnel if you have problems getting it done and then handle the api request inside the php
[01:03:50] <dirkpennings> if there's a paid jq plugin (on codecanyon or whatever), but can't find a plugin that does that
[01:04:23] <prefix> the problem is that I am creating a media player that plays soundcloud streams. however, soundcloud changes its stream URLs every 5 minutes
[01:05:44] <prefix> to combat this, I plan on issuing a new mp3 request whenever the media player's "play" button is clicked
[01:06:37] <Cork> prefix: note that you should ever only load jsonp from a server you trust, cause it will have execution rights on your page (it actually sends you js not json)
[01:07:24] <prefix> that's ok
[01:07:38] <prefix> I trust soundcloud in this case
[02:05:05] <daedeloth> anyone experience with jquery.ui? I'm trying to prevent bubbling of mouse move events on the slider
[02:10:27] <squeakytoy> Hey all. It is possible to add a lot of event listeners (for example (on)clicks)) on elements. Is there a good way to see what events are registered for a certain element?
[02:11:48] <Cork> squeakytoy: most of the time its better to use delegated event listeners instead of adding a bunch of them
[02:11:59] <Cork> cause event listeners will show down the speed of the dom
[02:12:07] <Cork> so you want to keep the number down
[02:12:09] <squeakytoy> what do you mean?
[02:12:26] <squeakytoy> use delegatd evet listerners
[02:12:33] <Cork> add a delegated event listener to a parent and catch the event there instead
[02:12:47] <squeakytoy> bubble up events?
[02:13:17] <Cork> ex instead of $('.parent .button').on('click(', function) do $('.parent').on('click', '.button', function)
[02:13:23] <Cork> opps
[02:13:26] <Cork> * ex instead of $('.parent .button').on('click', function) do $('.parent').on('click', '.button', function)
[02:13:47] <squeakytoy> yupp, ok
[02:13:51] <Cork> that adds one event listener instead of possibly hundreds
[02:14:05] <Cork> or even thousands
[02:14:25] <squeakytoy> since the browser bubbles up events automatically?
[02:14:29] <Cork> yes
[02:14:36] <squeakytoy> so you piggyback on that
[02:14:37] <squeakytoy> ok
[02:15:36] <squeakytoy> But my question remains, how can I easily see all registered events on an element? Lets say I have a <button> , how can i easily see what events are registered on the "click" event
[02:16:45] <t432> can have multiple "$(document).ready(function(){})" dedicated for different functions?
[02:16:49] <t432> can you*
[02:16:56] <Cork> squeakytoy: you can't really
[02:17:23] <squeakytoy> Cork, so its extremly difficult to debug it? hm
[02:17:26] <Cork> squeakytoy: you can get all events directly bound to a specific element through jquery
[02:17:40] <Cork> but that excludes delegated and events bound through pure dom
[02:17:41] <skamikaze> t432: try it out
[02:17:41] <squeakytoy> Cork, yea, if i write a debug-function, correct?
[02:18:17] <Cork> t432: not in different function, but you can have it multiple times in files
[02:18:32] <Cork> squeakytoy: not sure what you mean by debug function
[02:19:00] <squeakytoy> function printAllEvents( element, "click" ) { .... }
[02:19:11] <squeakytoy> and it loops through all registered events
[02:19:41] <Cork> well you can get the events bound by jquery
[02:19:58] <Cork> but like i said there is no list for events bound through pure dom calls
[02:20:20] <squeakytoy> if its through pure dom, then its only 1 event right?
[02:20:26] <Cork> no
[02:20:36] <Cork> elm.addEventListener
[02:20:54] <t432> Cork: I have funcfuntion b, can I have a seperate document,ready for each?
[02:20:55] <Cork> ^ thats what jquery uses
[02:21:04] <t432> function a and function b
[02:21:33] <Cork> you mean $(document).ready(functionB) ?
[02:21:45] <squeakytoy> Cork, oh, it appends :S
[02:21:59] <t432> $(document).ready(functionA) and $(document).ready(functionB)
[02:22:02] <Cork> squeakytoy: ya, its only dom1 event arguments that replace
[02:22:14] <Cork> s/arguemnts/attributes/
[02:22:21] <Cork> t432: ya, thats fine
[02:22:24] <squeakytoy> Cork, imo this is a crazy hazard
[02:22:33] <Cork> squeakytoy: not really
[02:22:48] <squeakytoy> Cork, for big web apps, you have no chance to figure out why X happens if you click on a button
[02:23:16] <Cork> squeakytoy: you shouldn't have to if you write you're code correctly
[02:23:30] <Cork> and you can use developer tools to catch events and see where they end up
[02:23:37] <squeakytoy> Cork, no if you use the bubble pattern i guess
[02:23:46] <Cork> either
[02:23:55] <Cork> bubble makes little difference there
[02:23:59] <squeakytoy> Cork, true, but you cant use developer tools to figure out who "added" the event
[02:24:06] <Cork> sure
[02:24:11] <Cork> you can find where the code is
[02:24:15] <Cork> as in the line number
[02:24:30] <squeakytoy> how?
[02:24:51] <Cork> by adding a breakpoint for dom events
[02:24:56] <squeakytoy> hm
[02:25:18] <squeakytoy> Cork, but basically you saying there should only be one "listener" for the whole page?
[02:25:26] <Cork> no
[02:25:41] <squeakytoy> Cork, you said not to put listener on the button, but on the parent?
[02:25:47] <Cork> i'm saying that event listeners should be added in a structured way
[02:25:57] <Cork> so you never end up in a situation like this
[02:26:11] <Cork> squeakytoy: thats also too generic
[02:26:23] <squeakytoy> Cork, so i am thinking, why stop at parent.. and not.. body?
[02:26:25] <Cork> my comment was about "a lot of event listeners"
[02:26:31] <squeakytoy> Cork, just bubble up everything :S
[02:26:52] <Cork> squeakytoy: cause you want to have the lowest common denominator
[02:27:11] <helpneeded> http://pastebin.com/cLjN3AAZ why am i getting undefined variable errors
[02:27:11] <Cork> so you don't have to check if the event is for something else all over the place
[02:27:12] <squeakytoy> well, that has pro and cons
[02:27:34] <Cork> helpneeded: ##php
[02:28:46] <helpneeded> Cork, #php will not let me send
[02:28:48] <squeakytoy> Cork, I have an <input> here infront of me, and I need to put some listeners to it. Not sure what the best approach is. $.bind would be the obvious choice, but maybe that is bad in the long run
[02:28:54] <Cork> ## not #
[02:29:20] <Cork> and you need to register your nick
[02:29:28] <Cork> see /ns help register
[02:30:08] <Cork> squeakytoy: bind/on is the correct choice if you only have one
[02:30:35] <Cork> if you plan to repeat the same elements with the need for the same event listener, then you should use delegate
[02:31:19] <Cork> basically its about not repeating event listeners that does the exact same thing
[03:05:45] <sampaka2> hi - sorry for the newbe question - how can i select each li element of my ul list so when i do a hover not every li of the list get faded in ('#portfolio ul li')
[03:17:39] <sampaka2> how do i select each li element separately?
[03:20:10] <alaing> hi if I have two different versions of jquery on a single page and one version i use .trigger will the event be available in the other version
[03:35:23] <Nancy2012> i am having tiny bug on the drop down validation since along timeâ¦ here is the  http://jsfiddle.net/nshx5/6/
[03:35:56] <Nancy2012> my jquery validation wouldnt work at all on the select list dropdown
[03:36:00] <Nancy2012> help please
[03:40:23] <mamed> hello guys. i have a problem. i uses jquery treeview . my code (php) works on my client machine but it does not work on other machines
[03:41:03] <NodeX> probably referencing localhost somehwhere
[03:42:05] <mamed> NodeX: no i have a server with 4 clients
[03:42:43] <mamed> not the localhost
[03:43:08] <tlkr> What exactly is not working?
[03:43:25] <NodeX> well if it works localy then it either is referencing localhost or your hosts file points to somehting that's not in DNS but is on your own system
[03:44:05] <mamed> NodeX: i did not understand sorry
[03:44:21] <NodeX> ok, good luck :)
[03:44:38] <mamed> my clients are windows and my server is linux. so in my client computer the code is working but others
[03:48:09] <tiphares> so i'm using this code: https://pastee.org/zrquy but the div i'm inserting doesn't properly inherit all the stuff from the class i'm adding it to (like margins), nor does the fading stuff apply to the newly added elements
[03:48:37] <tiphares> am i doing something horribly wrong here?
[03:49:47] <NodeX> it should inherit all .content{} and the parent
[03:50:07] <noregret> i want to force anyone browsing to my site to make the browser go full screen, how is it possible ?
[03:52:04] <tiphares> what about the fading stuff added on .ready() NodeX
[03:52:27] <tiphares> it looks like it does indeed inherit all the .content{} but it's rendered wrong still :\
[03:53:07] <NodeX> ?fadeTo
[03:53:23] <tiphares> yes
[03:53:49] <trinadh> Nancy2012: http://jsfiddle.net/nshx5/7/
[03:54:03] <NodeX> I dont really understand what "rendered wrong means"
[03:54:25] <tiphares> could just show you the site i suppose, one sec
[03:54:36] <mamed> can i add tables to treeview nodes
[04:08:33] <tiphares> NodeX sorry my webserver is having a seizure
[04:09:51] <NodeX> lol
[04:13:49] <tiphares> NodeX this working for ya http://www.charlietheunicorn.org/funQuery/
[04:14:24] <NodeX> yes
[04:15:01] <tiphares> f5 it
[04:15:07] <tiphares> and click the "add stuff" button
[04:15:19] <tiphares> an you see that the divs line up horribly
[04:16:33] <tiphares> and the js isn't applied to the new elements
[04:16:53] <NodeX> they line up fine for me
[04:18:04] <tiphares> the space between the colums is supposed to be the same as the other ones
[04:18:08] <tiphares> it's slightly different
[04:18:17] <NodeX> fadingBox.mouseenter(function() { <---- they need to use on()
[04:22:41] <Whiskey> Whats wrong here "if ($.browser.msie) && ($.browser.version == "11.0+") ) {"
[04:22:45] <Whiskey> lool
[04:24:06] <Whiskey> anyways it donÂ´t answer to this ether, if ($.browser.chrome) && ($.browser.version == "11.0") ) {
[04:24:15] <Whiskey> if i just wanne find the 11.0.xxxxxxx
[04:24:15] <tiphares> NodeX that didn't change anything :s
[04:24:36] <tiphares> if you mean like this: http://www.charlietheunicorn.org/funQuery/script.js
[04:25:34] <NodeX> you create the fadingbox var outside the doc ready so you'll need it inside
[04:27:12] <tiphares> didn't change anything either
[04:27:39] <tiphares> moved everything into the same $(doc)
[04:28:33] <NodeX> dunno what to say, it works fine for me when I do the code elsewhere
[04:28:52] <Whiskey> why does it not detect
[04:29:08] <NodeX> sorry you need to adapt your code
[04:29:30] <NodeX> $('body').on('mousenter','.content',function(){......});
[04:30:49] <tiphares> yeah that worked
[04:30:57] <tiphares> i have no idea why though
[04:33:57] <tiphares> why does it matter whether i have it stored in a variable :S?
[04:34:10] <algizmedia> extreme difficulties grabbing an images width!!! http://pastie.org/5654216 (dont laugh! im off for lunch if anyone can help in the meantime?)
[04:34:25] <NodeX> tiphares : it's not to do with that
[04:34:39] <NodeX> well it sort of is with inheritence but i cba to explain it
[04:34:42] <SmartViking> So I use jquery $.getJSON("/some.json", some_function); And some_function is called with some data as input. It seems like I have to rely on state, to get data out of that, is there a way to not rely on some_function modifying state?
[04:35:11] <NodeX> if you need to bind future events you need to bind on a currently existing element (body for example) with on()
[04:35:32] <tiphares> ah
[04:35:46] <tiphares> yeah that makes sense
[04:35:49] <tiphares> i suppose
[04:36:29] <tiphares> so i could've just put all the styling on a wrapping div
[04:36:34] <tiphares> and bound to that
[04:38:03] <NodeX> err yes if it exists at bind time
[04:38:18] <NodeX> I just used 'body' because it's always there
[04:38:23] <tiphares> yeah
[04:38:52] <tiphares> excuse my ignorance, i picked up jquary for the first time a few hours ago
[04:39:16] <tiphares> e*
[04:39:45] <NodeX> :D
[04:40:40] <shadow_fox> well backstretch is not working in my webpage... here is the live link http://sulopa.net/nishang/
[04:43:28] <pajo> can anyone suggest me a plugin or something for simple panel (w/o heading and stuff)
[04:44:28] <cuddle`> hello, I'm trying to manipulate HTML outside of the DOM like so: http://jsbin.com/urusoq/8/edit
[04:44:38] <cuddle`> but it can't seem to save any of the changes
[04:44:46] <cuddle`> I'm not sure how I should approach this
[04:47:08] <pajo> cuddle if you want to append an elem with jquery you first have to convert the selector sting into jq element
[04:47:14] <pajo> $(s) <- like this
[04:47:48] <pajo> and your output var seems to have no value
[04:48:22] <pajo> sry, the output has a val
[04:49:27] <pajo> but: $.(output).append() should be just output.append() because it's already a jq element
[04:50:22] <cuddle`> I made it so that output remains just a html string
[04:50:39] <cuddle`> it gets $('something in dom').html()
[04:50:53] <pajo> i see
[04:50:59] <cuddle`> I don't want to add underscore so am just using it as a template like so
[04:51:08] <cuddle`> I don't want to change those dom elements
[04:51:33] <cuddle`> I want to manipulate outside of the dom, but I can't seem to get it to perform those operations on the string
[04:51:37] <cuddle`> :S
[04:52:43] <SmartViking> When I do $.getJSON("rgerg.json", afunction); and inside the function afunction tries to modify global variables it doesn't seem to work, it's like I have to store state in the DOM
[04:55:29] <pajo> cuddle`: jQuery( selector [, context ] )
[04:55:48] <cuddle`> how should I use that?
[04:55:56] <cuddle`> oh wait
[04:56:00] <pajo> context being your output
[04:56:02] <tomasm-> hi, is it possible to get draggable({containment: [x1,y1,x2,y2]}) to function relative to the container and not the window? i want a draggable image to be able to move slightly "outside" of the parent div, but not so far off that it's not visible. I've tried setting position:relative to the parent but the top/left calculated seems to be per the window, ie -300,-450 (which is NOT within my constraints!)
[04:56:12] <pajo> but i think you should have some selector too
[04:57:10] <pajo> or even easier -> output += content
[04:57:13] <cuddle`> no luck ):
[04:57:20] <cuddle`> the thing is
[04:57:25] <cuddle`> the append and attr
[04:57:35] <cuddle`> both seem to work fine, if I wrap them in a console.log
[04:57:48] <cuddle`> it shows the object having added those operations
[04:58:03] <cuddle`> but when I return the output, like here, it doesn't do anything
[05:02:34] <pajo> you need to have the new element inside popup-content?
[05:03:16] <SmartViking> No, afunction did modify the global variable, but I accessed it before the callback function had been called
[05:03:17] <cuddle`> yes
[05:05:37] <tomasm-> anyone familiar with the draggable({containment: [array]}) syntax?
[05:07:39] <cuddle`> pajo: I got it to add the content like so: http://jsbin.com/urusoq/11/edit
[05:07:44] <cuddle`> but it somehow loses the 2 divs
[05:07:59] <cuddle`> I don't mind it losing the outer div, but the one inside, not sure why it's removing that
[05:09:58] <pajo> isee no difference, only an error is new :D
[05:10:27] <cuddle`> eh
[05:10:36] <cuddle`> it didn't save -.-
[05:13:38] <cuddle`> sigh jsbin is acting weird
[05:16:03] <pajo> and is slow
[05:16:31] <cuddle`> weird...
[05:17:11] <cuddle`> haha swell, I just put the $('#popup-infowindowetc').html() inside a $()
[05:17:15] <pajo> how can i save my own copy?
[05:17:21] <cuddle`> I'm not really sure
[05:17:24] <cuddle`> maybe press share
[05:18:41] <h0m1x> Hi
[05:19:16] <pajo> http://jsbin.com/urusoq/13/edit
[05:19:20] <pajo> i dunno if this is correct
[05:19:23] <h0m1x> I have setup everything needed for running jquery , but it doesn't work !
[05:19:52] <h0m1x> My jquery code doesn't function and run through the browser
[05:20:00] <h0m1x> pajo: Hey
[05:20:28] <pajo> hi
[05:20:41] <pajo> cuddle`: do you see the changes? :P
[05:20:58] <cuddle`> nope, but jsbin stopped working somehow :S
[05:21:11] <h0m1x> pajo: I have run the jquery but i don't why it doesn't function in my web browser
[05:21:37] <pajo> are you sure that jquery is included correctly
[05:22:08] <h0m1x> pajo: Ofcourse, I have rechecked when you said
[05:22:18] <pajo> cuddle`: http://pastebin.com/Lchc5798
[05:22:48] <pajo> h0m1x: no other libs?
[05:23:02] <h0m1x> pajo: No just jquery and my naj.js file
[05:23:09] <h0m1x> *nav.js
[05:23:22] <pajo> h0m1x: and what does alert($); say?
[05:23:39] <h0m1x> pajo: I have test it but it doesn't function !
[05:23:56] <pajo> h0m1x: are you loading your nav after jquery?
[05:24:07] <pajo> DOM ready? :P
[05:24:12] <cuddle`> thank you pajo :D
[05:24:22] <cuddle`> but it's weird how it adds the id to the a
[05:24:23] <h0m1x> pajo: Yeah, and they're both between the head tag and I checked whether DOM is ready.
[05:24:27] <cuddle`> and not the div
[05:24:43] <cuddle`> oh wait no
[05:24:46] <cuddle`> you did that by design
[05:25:12] <cuddle`> thanks again, had a hard time wrapping my head around it
[05:25:34] <h0m1x> pajo: I just wonder , what the hell is going on !
[05:27:07] <pajo> cuddle`: glad i could help
[05:27:27] <pajo> h0m1x: can you post your code somewhere
[05:27:42] <h0m1x> pajo: I'm doing this ATM
[05:27:56] <sanderj_> How can I dynamicly add a span on a given position inside a class?
[05:28:47] <h0m1x> http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/0N0Y
[05:28:52] <h0m1x> pajo: ^
[05:29:33] <h0m1x> pajo: And nav.js => http://www.heypasteit.com/clip/0N0Z
[05:31:14] <h0m1x> pajo: Did you check bro?
[05:32:18] <pajo> h0m1x: yes, dont see anything wrong here. have you tried the include links inside browsers "view source..."
[05:33:13] <h0m1x> pajo: !!! they won't be included !
[05:33:29] <h0m1x> pajo: Ridiculous the path is okay !
[05:33:30] <pajo> IE 1.0? :D
[05:33:45] <h0m1x> pajo: Firefox latest version
[05:34:17] <pajo> h0m1x: if not included then the links must be invalid
[05:34:46] <algizmedia> extreme difficulties grabbing an images width!!! http://pastie.org/5654216 did anyone look at this? my terminal wont allow me to scroll back up to check!
[05:35:06] <h0m1x> I have a index.php file then a folder near the index.php in the same dir called js inside the it I have bot jquery files
[05:35:15] <h0m1x> pajo: ^
[05:36:36] <Ouchy> h0m1x is your sit elive that we could look at it?
[05:36:39] <pajo> and whatabout error console?
[05:37:04] <h0m1x> Ouchy: No, I'm testing on local server
[05:37:16] <Ouchy> yeah then check the console
[05:37:24] <Ouchy> see if there are any errors
[05:37:40] <pajo> and get firebug as fast as possible :)
[05:38:23] <noregret> i want to force anyone browsing to my site to make the browser go full screen, how is it possible ?
[05:39:45] <pajo> noregret: There isn't a way to resize the current window to full screen, but you can open a popup in full screen
[05:39:47] <Cork> noregret: window.requestFullscreen if i remember correctly
[05:40:26] <Cork> ah, no elm.requestFullscreen
[05:40:37] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_fullscreen_mode
[05:41:46] <pajo> Cork: this seems to be FF only?!
[05:41:58] <pajo> new popup should work everywhere :)
[05:42:08] <Cork> pajo: its not
[05:42:12] <pajo> ok
[05:42:13] <noregret> cool, thanks
[05:42:40] <pajo> but IE has question marks
[05:43:32] <noregret> so its like $(document).requestFullscreen() ?
[05:45:19] <pajo> noregret: and some css for webkit compatibility
[05:46:06] <pajo> noregret: the toggleFullScreen() function seems pretty nice in there
[05:47:25] <Cork> pajo: ya i don't think ie supports it at all
[05:47:41] <algizmedia> i cant get my image.width! can anyone help?? http://pastie.org/5654216
[05:47:46] <Cork> noregret: document.body.requestFullscreen()

[07:08:50] <Anticom> hi all
[07:08:54] <Anticom> hey xec
[07:09:12] <xec> o/
[07:09:48] <Anticom> um i've got a question, that's going around my head for quite a while now... in key-events there is "keyCode" and "which" refering to the same values for each key
[07:09:51] <Anticom> so what's the difference?
[07:10:04] <Anticom> is one of them derp-recated support?
[07:12:19] <xec> 'which' is normalized by jQuery
[07:12:33] <Anticom> meaning?
[07:12:47] <xec> so it'll be the same cross-browser
[07:12:57] <Anticom> and keyCode is not
[07:12:59] <Anticom> is it?
[07:13:18] <xec> afaik
[07:13:24] <Anticom> ok thx
[07:13:27] <Anticom> made my day :*
[07:15:06] <xec> Anticom: http://api.jquery.com/event.which/
[07:16:05] <Anticom> cool, now i finally got this
[07:16:14] <xec> what is ":*" btw
[07:16:16] <Anticom> *le check
[07:16:22] <Anticom> short form of :-*
[07:16:26] <xec> okay
[07:16:34] <xec> what is ":-*"
[07:16:45] <Anticom> as you might know programmers belong to the lazy part of our world population ;)
[07:16:55] <Anticom> haha
[07:16:59] <Kingsy> if you catch an event, in this case, a click event, and you want to do somethings but you don't want to stop the anchor from getting followed how is that achieved?
[07:17:07] <xec> i'm serious, dont laugh =(
[07:17:45] <Anticom> Kingsy there should be plenty page scrolling plugins
[07:17:46] <xec> Kingsy: thats the default behavior
[07:18:00] <Anticom> xec touchÃ© :/
[07:18:01] <Kingsy> xec: hrm, it doesnt follow the achor..
[07:18:18] <Anticom> then you either got e.preventDefault() in your handler or your html is crap ;)
[07:18:21] <xec> Kingsy: just make sure your handler doesn't return false or call preventDefault() on the event object
[07:19:00] <Kingsy> ohh, its prototype.. damn sorry guys, its being assigned a function on click by prototype
[07:19:20] <Absolute0> I am trying to implement a drag utility function, but I am getting very weird results: http://pastie.org/5655247. the drag and endDrag console logs get logged even if I don't fire a mousedown.
[07:19:45] <Absolute0> Does anything look out of place there?
[07:24:00] <evildmp> I am trying to learn some jquery - $this.closest('fieldset').next('fieldset') should select the next sibling fieldset that is a sibling of the element I am on now, yes?
[07:30:40] <h0m1x> evildmp: hey
[07:30:55] <evildmp> hello h0m1x
[07:31:01] <h0m1x> evildmp: How to say if it was not clicked in jquery ?
[07:33:52] <evildmp> h0m1x: I am building on this: http://jsfiddle.net/GudQP/2/; in fact I will add my much more complex HTML to that and work there I think
[07:34:33] <h0m1x> evildmp: Cool
[07:36:23] <greengriminal> I am trying to to find the correct dialog that corresponds to the <td> that was clicked. Data-attributes is one option. I currently have the following http://jsfiddle.net/T7DpV/ This does not do what as I expect
[07:36:56] <greengriminal> However I have come up with something like the following but am not sure if this is correct: http://jsfiddle.net/bGNwF/
[07:39:08] <Alarm_> hello, i have those two following lines , currentDataItem.unbind("change", confirmEdit).bind("change", confirmEdit); $('#grid').data("kendoGrid").cancelChanges();
[07:39:14] <Alarm_> the problem is that although there is a change event, instead of calling my function it goes to the following row that clears my fields.
[07:39:40] <Alarm_> once i remove the line $('#grid').data("kendoGrid").cancelChanges();   from my code, my function "confirmEdit" is called without a problem
[07:41:28] <Alarm_> why is this happening ?  how can i make that that bind to call my function before going to the final line ?
[07:43:15] <plovs> how can I match: <input type="text" name="map[gm3_map_lat][][]" value="2"> (got lost with all the squer brackets)
[07:47:25] <BillCriswell> plovs: It can be as simple as input[name^=map] depending on how specific you need.
[07:47:55] <BillCriswell> That'll match all <input/>s that has a name attribute that begins with map.
[07:48:15] <plovs> BillCriswell i have loads of "map[gm3_map_"
[07:48:41] <plovs> map[gm3_map_lat map[gm3_map_lng map[gm3_map_zoom etc
[07:48:51] <BillCriswell> Ok then, $('input[name="map[gm3_map_lat][][]"]') should work
[07:49:22] <BillCriswell> If it doesn't you may need to escape the [ and ].
[07:49:46] <plovs> BillCriswell that is embarrassingly simple
[07:51:06] <plovs> BillCriswell you were right, i just forgot to use .val() in the next line, thanks!
[07:51:16] <BillCriswell> plovs: No problem.
[07:53:36] <akkufomk> is there a way to show a vertical scrollbar ONLY if the content of the div is overflowing in the browser
[07:53:56] <reloadz> hi! an abyone hrlp with setTimeout?
[07:53:56] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/zXxmg/
[07:54:16] <reloadz> sry - hi! can anyone help with setTimeout?
[07:54:33] <akkufomk> setTimeout(function() { alert('hey'); }, 1000);
[07:56:10] <andrewSC> hi all
[07:57:34] <katsh> How do we get the topmost visible pixel row?
[07:57:52] <motka> katsh: in what?
[07:57:55] <reloadz> akkufomk: you call for alert - works fine, but I call for function and i cant make it work
[07:58:06] <andrewSC> quick question, I have a form that has a single input field with save and cancel buttons. As of right now I want the user to be able to either press enter while within the input field or click the save button to fire off an ajax call.  Can both of these events just be wrapped into one submit event function?
[07:58:29] <katsh> motka: the browser. i want to show an element, but have it display at the top of the visible window
[07:58:35] <NodeX> andrewSC : yes
[07:59:00] <andrewSC> NodeX: cool, thanks for the heads up
[07:59:03] <akkufomk> reloadz: this is in a different context
[07:59:09] <akkufomk> reloadz: that's why
[07:59:58] <evildmp> I have now is http://jsfiddle.net/GudQP/8/ - the HTML looks pretty bloaty and horrible, but it's what I have to work with - anyway, I am trying to get the <select> at line 11 of the HTML to act on the <div> at line 53, which I think will involve using a chain of traversal functions with the right selectors; does that sound like the right approach?
[08:00:07] <akkufomk> reloadz: http://pastebin.com/vdXtqK4G
[08:00:17] <akkufomk> reloadz: try that
[08:00:35] <evildmp> bear in mind that this HTML will be repeated multiple times, with different numbers in the id attributes
[08:01:05] <khayes> How can I determine what version of if a version of jquery-ui is compatible with a specific version of jQuery?
[08:02:09] <reloadz> akkufomk: thx
[08:04:33] <greengriminal> Can anyone help find a way of finding the correct dialog that corresponds to a <td> that is clicked. I have http://jsfiddle.net/T7DpV/ which does not do what i want and have tried to do something like  http://jsfiddle.net/bGNwF/ but not sure if that will work either
[08:07:04] <andrewSC> NodeX: if the save and cancel buttons are hyperlinks then the submit function won't work right?
[08:07:10] <andrewSC> they have to be input elements?
[08:07:32] <Ved_1> hey guys i got an issue here.. i have a dialog form where im showing a list of results with ajax.. the problem is im only getting results when i refresh the page.. otherwise is not working when i close the form and i reopen it.. here is some code http://jsfiddle.net/u3hAb/
[08:08:13] <andrewSC> NodeX: nvm sorry to bother you--I just need to RTFM before I ask.
[08:09:55] <Saaether> Ved_1 did you rename your function for your example? cause your function is searchForm but your page calls buscarForm
[08:10:39] <Ved_1> Saaether:  oh yes i rename it
[08:11:02] <tlkr> Does anyone know of a method of bubbling up a blur event. Basically I want a handler function to fire if nothing within a specific div element has focus.
[08:12:17] <Ved_1> here it is http://jsfiddle.net/u3hAb/1/
[08:12:41] <andrewSC> tlkr: don't events bubble up by default?
[08:12:51] <andrewSC> unless you use triggerHandler()
[08:12:54] <andrewSC> orsomething weird?
[08:13:11] <chilversc_> is there anyway to test if a jQuery UI widget/interaction has been initialized yet?
[08:14:22] <Bheam> yo
[08:14:23] <chilversc_> specifically I want to test if the selectable interaction has been applied to an element to avoid the error, "cannot call methods on selectable prior to initialization"
[08:15:07] <Bheam> i have a <div><a><span>abc</span></a></div> - how can I use jquery to manipulate the dom so the A is outside the div instead, while the span is still inside?
[08:15:19] <t432> if a program lanaguge like java returns a boolean function, how does jquery interpret that ? (0 and 1) or "true/false"?
[08:15:50] <chilversc_> t432: that really depends upon how you get that data to javascript
[08:15:55] <tlkr> andrewSC the blur event does not bubble up as far as I know.
[08:16:02] <t432> chilversc_: ajax call
[08:16:17] <chilversc_> t432: ok, but the data could be any many formats from the ajax call
[08:16:34] <t432> i see what you mean, json
[08:17:09] <t432> what it if the format was json
[08:17:13] <chilversc_> t432: and now how does java encode the value, is it; {"foo": true}, {"foo": 1}, {"foo": "Y"} ?
[08:17:38] <t432> "return true"
[08:17:42] <xckpd7> question (I asked this yesterday): is there anyway to define variables and then use them in a selector like this? $(blah,foo).addClass();
[08:17:53] <xckpd7> I do not want to cache them together
[08:17:55] <t432> i guess i can use the above
[08:17:57] <chilversc_> t432: that's the java code, but how is that result encoded in to json?
[08:18:01] <t432> what you indivated
[08:18:19] <t432> indicated*
[08:18:32] <t432> i'll have to check it out.
[08:18:59] <chilversc_> xckpd7: so you want to combine multiple selectors in to a single selector then use .addClass ?
[08:20:14] <xckpd7> chilversc_: yes but I want to be able to use them separately as well... some guy tried to have me do var blah = $('.blah,#foo')
[08:20:30] <sCoRpi_> Bheam: you'll have to move the span into the div, then detach the a-tag, add it before the div and then append the div to the a-tag
[08:21:19] <xckpd7> chilversc_: I basically want to cache the selectors separately, but use both of them without having to write separate declarations, ala $cached.addClass, $cached2.addClass
[08:21:44] <xckpd7> some guy yesterday said something like $([blah, foo])?
[08:23:04] <shlomif> Hi all. How do I make a JavaScript function that takes a long time "yield" in order for the browser to update the window?
[08:23:22] <xckpd7> because this doesn't work: http://jsfiddle.net/Byx7z/6/
[08:23:34] <andrew9184> read the jquery docs
[08:23:41] <andrew9184> you are using $(foo,bar) incorrectly
[08:24:00] <nashant> Alright guys. I'm trying to make an auto scrolling customer feedback div, but I can't find any examples anywhere. Any pointers?
[08:25:05] <chilversc_> xckpd7: the array didn't work for me, I guess that only works if blah and foo are elements rather than selectors
[08:25:35] <chilversc_> can't see a simple way to combine selectors
[08:26:24] <michaelfillier> Been racking my brain with a jQuery Mobile problem.
[08:26:59] <michaelfillier> Trying to run a function in a page that will attach a pageshow event to the current page only.
[08:27:26] <michaelfillier> Seems simple, but I can't get it going.
[08:28:12] <chilversc_> xckpd7: ah, this works; $(a).add(b).addClass(...)
[08:28:30] <chilversc_> xckpd7: the initial $(a) means you get a copy of the original selector, so that the .add doesn't modify it
[08:29:02] <michaelfillier> I am going to create a gist.
[08:30:46] * webdev dropkicks michaelfillier
[08:31:56] * michaelfillier kicks webdev in crotch
[08:32:07] <michaelfillier> webdev: wtf dude
[08:32:38] <evildmp> hi BillCriswell thanks so much for the example you gave me yesterday - I've come up with: http://jsfiddle.net/GudQP/19/ which as far as I can tell does just what I need it to do
[08:33:08] <evildmp> I'm sure that's not the most elegant way I could do it, but it works
[08:37:08] <BillCriswell> No problem. Glad you got it all figured out
[08:40:34] <webdev> michaelfillier??
[08:41:12] <EdwardIII> harramph
[08:41:41] <miCSu> I've got a function that gets contents from different pages to a lightbox with ajax. Otherwise works fine, but trying to get data from one single webpage doesn't work on any IE (works on firefox, safari, chrome). The requested html page passes W3 validator. Also the data gotten in success could be logged to console etc, $(data) is identified as an object but $(data).html() is undefined and neither it nor data appends anything on the lightbox
[08:42:32] <EdwardIII> i'm looking at this code here, can't seem to track it back - is 'sort' a jQuery function? http://pastie.org/5655693
[08:43:08] <EdwardIII> ah, .sort is a native javascript feature on arrays
[08:46:19] <michaelfillier> Anyone know how to call a function in jQuery mobile that will delegate an event to the current active page?
[08:46:45] <michaelfillier> I want to call the function from within the page to apply an event to the current page.
[08:53:38] <xckpd7> chilversc_: what do you mean it gets a copy of the original selector?
[08:54:03] <xckpd7> chilversc_: and can this actually be called caching? each time you call that, jQuery still has to go get the selector...
[08:54:24] <xckpd7> so there is no way to basically combine $cachedSelector and $anotherCacheSelector into one declaration
[08:55:25] <Mubin> hi guys
[08:55:38] <xckpd7> I want var body = $('body'), var html = $('html'), and now that they're cached, I want to do body,html.addClass() or something remotely close to that
[08:55:41] <Mubin> having issue sorting information
[08:56:41] <Mubin> Question: I have an array of javascript objects,
[08:56:43] <Mubin> var videoObj = [ { video: 'United Kingdom',length: '105' },
[08:56:43] <Mubin>             { video: 'China', length: '205'  },
[08:56:43] <Mubin>             { video: 'India', length: '400' },
[08:56:44] <Mubin>             { video: 'China', length: '300'  }
[08:56:44] <Mubin>            ];
[08:56:59] <Mubin> how do i sort by video?
[08:56:59] <nFFF> xckpd7, you can combine the objects
[08:57:02] <andrew9184> you just use one var when joining them , ie var body = "foo", bar = "baz"
[08:57:08] <nFFF> ?add @ xckpd7
[08:57:09] <bot-t> xckpd7, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[08:57:16] <andrew9184> Mubin, please use pastebin or jsfiddle
[08:57:20] <BillCriswell> Mubin: You use .sort()
[08:57:32] <michaelfillier> Here is a gist that outlines my jquery mobile stacking pageshow problem: https://gist.github.com/4494760
[08:57:43] <Mubin> .sort() works fie on letters and numbers
[08:57:47] <Mubin> fine*
[08:57:50] <michaelfillier> basically I need to call a function on init and then reload it on pageshow.
[08:58:03] <BillCriswell> Mubin: Exactly.
[08:58:07] <Mubin> will use jsfiddle
[08:58:08] <tomasm-> hey what's the best way to define a set of functions based around a class, that I can invoke via $(selector).functionName() ? I want to split all the code into several functions, not just in $.fn.functionName() - and I dont think adding more to $.fn would make sense since it's all internal to that operation. it's not really object oriented, so would defining functions inside the $.fn.functionName()  work best?
[08:58:09] <Mubin> thanks!
[08:58:37] <michaelfillier> I run the function on certain pages only, but I will NOT know the id of the page. (I am running this in django)
[09:00:25] <nFFF> michaelfillier, and whats not working right now?
[09:02:26] <chadoh> I just noticed that jQuery.fn.remove() doesn't trigger a 'mouseleave' event. I think it should.
[09:02:40] <xckpd7> nFFF: alright that works, thanks
[09:02:50] <xckpd7> chilversc_: thanks
[09:02:52] <BillCriswell> chadoh: Why?
[09:03:53] <algizmedia> q
[09:04:09] <BillCriswell> Mubin: I'm just saying, you can do .sort(function(a,b){ return a.video > b.video });
[09:04:25] <nFFF> xckpd7, your issue is now one of the vars contains both set of objects, it's more logical to just do: var tings = $('body, html');
[09:04:37] <Mubin> will try it
[09:04:40] <Mubin> thanks BillCriswell
[09:05:26] <chadoh> BillCriswell: To give an example: say you trigger a tooltip to appear on mouseenter for elementX. Then some other process happens and elementX is removed. Now the tooltip will stay around forever.
[09:06:03] <chadoh> Assuming, of course, that the tooltip was going to go away on mouseleave for elementX.
[09:06:05] <chilversc_> so it seems like I have to use; if (foo.data('selectable') != null) foo.selectable('destroy'); to avoid getting an error
[09:06:41] <BillCriswell> Mubin: videoObj.sort(function(a,b){ return a.video < b.video ? -1 : b.video > a.video ? 1 : 0; }); might be a little more cross browser compatable.
[09:06:50] <chadoh> BillCriswell: If you have suggestions of ways to do that without patching core jQuery features, I'm eager to hear them.
[09:07:55] <Mubin> will try that to thanks again BillCriswell
[09:08:04] <BillCriswell> chadoh: I'm just saying if you trigger a mouse leave event before you remove an element from the DOM that will cause some serious headaches.
[09:08:04] <nFFF> chadoh, jsut use ?trigger
[09:08:05] <bot-t> chadoh, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[09:08:17] <BillCriswell> Just trigger it before you remove the element.
[09:08:25] <BillCriswell> $el.trigger('mouseleave'); $el.remove();
[09:08:37] <BillCriswell> Mubin: No problem.
[09:08:47] <Mubin> appreciate it dude! thanks! :)
[09:08:57] <BillCriswell> No problem at all.
[09:09:58] <chadoh> BillCriswell nFFF bot-t: all y'all rock, thanks. Out of curiousity, what headaches would universally calling "mouseleave" as part of the "remove" process cause?
[09:10:32] <BillCriswell> If you added it so it happens every time you remove every element is how the headaches would cause.
[09:10:34] <nFFF> Unwanted behaviour?
[09:10:55] <nFFF> You don't always want mouseleave to fire when you remove an element...
[09:11:27] <nFFF> Imagine if you click element A, to remove element B, you want to fire a mouseleave event where? and why does it make sense?
[09:11:31] <chadoh> nFFF If the mouse was over it at the moment it was removed, I'd say you do.
[09:11:59] <chadoh> So I guess there is a conditional on it.
[09:12:01] <nFFF> chadoh, perhaps, so do it pragmatically with .trigger(), not sure it's an argument to make it default behaviour
[09:13:22] <michaelfillier> wow, can't quite grasp this. how can I trigger a function in a jquery mobile page that attaches an event to that page?
[09:14:24] <nFFF> michaelfillier, I've never used jquery mobile, but on page load, you'd load the relevent javascript ?
[09:16:43] <chadoh> nFFF: If my cursor is over an element and that element is removed, I think it would always be appropriate to fire 'mouseleave' on that element before removal. Adding it manually in my code base each time an element is removed seems inelegant.
[09:17:35] <mklappstuhl> is there a way to combine "this" in a selector with other things? like so: $(this ~ .class-xy).hide()
[09:17:38] <BillCriswell> chadoh: The big if there is the cursor being over the element.
[09:18:21] <nFFF> chadoh, I think it's a unique situation to you, but just make your own function that within it calls both remove and trigger?
[09:18:58] <BillCriswell> $el.trigger('mouseleave').remove();
[09:19:08] <nFFF> $.fn.chadohed(..call remove() and trigger() on elements..);
[09:19:13] <chutwig> is there a reason why, with jquery UI 1.9.2, my datepickers still initialize with today's date selected even when defaultDate is null?
[09:19:36] <nFFF> mklappstuhl, sure just use commas
[09:19:54] <nFFF> ?multiple selector @ mklappstuhl
[09:19:57] <bot-t> mklappstuhl, Multiple Selector - jQuery API Documentation - Selects the combined results of all the specified selectors. http://api.jquery.com/multiple-selector/
[09:21:10] <michaelfillier> maybe another approach. If I place a <script>doAFunction();</script> Can I can the parent element of the script tag that the function is being called from?
[09:21:11] <chadoh> BillCriswell: That is a big if. I'm early intermediate at JS and have no idea how intensive a calculation that would be. If it's particularly easy to check if the cursor is over the thing, then it seems appropriate to add this feature at the library level. Otherwise, I think nFFF's suggestion is great.
[09:21:52] <nFFF> chadoh, add it at library level as in core jQuery for everyone else, or your won fork? :>
[09:22:17] <nFFF> Becuase its a crazy suggestion to add it to the core library, I can't think of many mainstream use cases :>>
[09:22:17] <t432> when inserting text into element, whats the difference between .html() and .text()?
[09:22:27] <t432> are they same?
[09:22:31] <nFFF> no
[09:22:35] <nFFF> read the docs
[09:22:37] <nFFF> ?html
[09:22:37] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[09:22:38] <nFFF> ?text
[09:22:39] <bot-t> .text(): Get the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants. http://api.jquery.com/text/
[09:22:49] <chutwig> the datepickers are linked so that selecting a date in one sets minDate/maxDate appropriately in the other one, so you can select a range without going out of bounds
[09:23:27] <chutwig> but when selecting a date in the to picker, it sets the date in the from picker, so you have to page way back in the from picker and select an arbitrary date well in the past
[09:24:03] <mklappstuhl> nFFF: I think this is not what I meant. basically I have an element (this) and I want to get the next sibling of it and do some other stuff with it...
[09:24:39] <nFFF> oh I get you
[09:24:41] <mklappstuhl> nFFF: so I want to combine "this" with "~ .class" but not get all elements with ".class"
[09:25:24] <nFFF> this is DOM object  not a standard selector
[09:25:31] <nFFF> youd have to chain a function to it
[09:25:45] <nFFF> wait
[09:27:15] <nFFF> $(this + "~ .class")
[09:27:52] <nFFF> no that wont work
[09:28:25] <nFFF> Yea youll have to use a function like $(this).siblings() etc

[09:33:44] <cusco> http://jsfiddle.net/Pur72/

[09:59:20] <therealkoopa> Does anyone know of any html validators that validate the dom against the changes made in Javascript? I hate having to grab $('html').html() and throw it into the w3c validator manually, for each page.
[10:00:25] <angrywombat> anyone know if you can monitor when a variable changes in jquery? the scope is window, not the closure
[10:01:48] <t432> append() just keeps adding text to the end, is there function to just add text once and subsequent adds just replace existing text?
[10:02:24] <cusco> .html()
[10:02:36] <cusco> or .innerHTML =
[10:02:49] <cusco> or .empty() first
[10:03:23] <cusco> hi

[10:14:28] <djMax> I have an embedded web view (in a mobile app) where I want the page context to live "a long time." So I'm trying to be careful about things like infinitely growing history. Is there a way to reset/go back in history to the "first" page of this jQuery mobile page?
[10:15:23] <t432> cusco:html() seems to make other input fields dissappear living only the text inside the html(foo)
[10:15:34] <t432> all input*

[10:38:58] <chrisbolton> Suggestion on a query function to use to remove the content of a text field after I've submitted it?
[10:39:15] <chrisbolton> I tried .empty() which removes the element entirely.
[10:39:32] <chrisbolton> I also tried .reset() which didn't seem to work.
[10:40:39] <shoky> chrisbolton: .val('')
[10:41:25] <Intensity> NEVER .empty!!!
[10:41:27] <Intensity> EVER!
[10:41:39] <chrisbolton> shoky: That seems too simple.
[10:41:46] <chrisbolton> Intensity: Why?
[10:41:57] <Intensity> it will destroy the planet
[10:42:01] <shoky> too simple?
[10:42:18] <chrisbolton> Intensity: The whole planet, wow. I didn't know.
[10:42:42] <chrisbolton> shoky: Yeah is it wrong that I hesitate because it seems so simple.
[10:43:06] <shoky> yes
[10:43:35] <andrewSC> how do most live searches work? do they listen to keyup events?
[10:43:56] <chrisbolton> shoky: Okay, duly noted.
[10:46:24] <RA13> andewSC: I would have a 2-3 second "cool down" period for a live search, on keyup start the timer and if they don't type again during the cool down, THEN search
[10:48:28] <andrewSC> RA13: right, I've got that my problem is because I'm listening to keyup any time I try to "control-a" to select all, nothing is selected/as soon as i lift my fingers from c-a nothing is selected anymore
[10:48:36] <andrewSC> so i'm trying to figure out how to prevent that haha
[10:48:58] <andrewSC> besides listening to specific keys with .which
[10:50:13] <r1card> Hi people. Can I tell jQuery to batch a set of CSS changes together so things don't fall apart as several separate selectors are running?
[10:52:14] <shoky> r1card: not really
[10:52:22] <shoky> what's falling apart..
[10:52:23] <r1card> oh cr...
[10:52:24] <tlkr> r1card why would you need to do that? just run them sequentially.
[10:52:34] <r1card> tlkr, it doesn't look well.
[10:52:46] <tlkr> have you given it any paracetomol?
[10:52:59] <shoky> yum
[10:53:11] <r1card> shoky, tlkr, I update the top/left/width/height of a bunch of elements. I have to change widths/height first, then top(s) and then left(s) and webkit renders this unfortunately.
[10:53:31] <r1card> So as I resize the page it looks as if the widget is falling apart as each change is chasing the rest.
[10:54:03] <Ved_1> hey guys i got an issue here.. i have a dialog form where im showing a list of results with ajax.. the problem is im only getting results when i refresh the page.. otherwise is not working when i close the form and i reopen it.. here is some code http://jsfiddle.net/u3hAb/
[10:54:18] <Connorhd> r1card: can't you just set all 4 values at the same time?
[10:54:31] <r1card> Connorhd, I can't. The values are different for different elements.
[10:54:34] <Ved_1> i have rename the function
[10:54:45] <r1card> Connorhd, I can optimize it a bit but it'll still be at least a few calls.
[10:54:59] <chrisbolton> How would one go about doing an after submit for a form in query?
[10:55:06] <Connorhd> r1card: are you applying all the changes in one block of code? I thought browsers generally applied all changes made synchronously at once
[10:55:16] <r1card> Connorhd, I thought that too.
[10:55:19] <chilversc> r1card: odd, it shouldn't be visible if its all within the same unit of execution (ie, no setTimeout tricks)
[10:55:21] <r1card> Connorhd, I am.
[10:55:28] <r1card> Yeah.
[10:55:31] <r1card> Odd right.
[10:55:37] <chilversc> r1card: got an example of this?
[10:56:00] <r1card> Oh my goodness, I have more problems.
[10:56:05] <r1card> Maybe something else is off.
[10:56:25] <r1card> chilversc, I'll debug a bit more and if's this I'll submit an example.
[10:56:32] <r1card> Thanks everyone.
[11:05:15] <guide_X> any idea why i'd be getting this with a simple image? "Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html:"
[11:05:23] <guide_X> and the rest points to the image
[11:05:56] <guide_X> my image looks like this <img alt="" src="i/gfx/ajax-loader.gif" class="loading-gif2" style="display:none" />
[11:09:17] <r1card>  Hey folks, just so you know what my problem was. I had <div I set size for> <div absolute> <img height/width 100%> </div> </div>
[11:09:41] <r1card> So the image wasn't "catching up" with the top level div size despite the 100%. Why? Because the second div wasn't 100% height/width.
[11:10:05] <r1card> So it'd eventually match the top parent, but after several recalculations. Odd.
[11:10:14] <r1card> Setting second div explicitly to 100% width/height fixed it.
[11:11:10] <r1card> guide_X, my best guess is the image isn't exactly there, so it returns an error page, say 404 page. Or such.
[11:11:31] <r1card> guide_X, if not, then the server MIME types are wrong for this extension (gif)
[11:12:05] <ruz1> why does people register .io domains?

[11:13:45] <ruz1> they registers for example fusion.io
[11:13:54] <[jmc]> it makes you look "kewl" these days
[11:14:03] <NoiseEee> kewl.io
[11:14:30] <ruz1> what's that?
[11:15:01] <BillCriswell> I fucking hate getting bored after the difficult part is complete.
[11:16:25] <ruz1> io = input/output is the same as .wf == wonderfull
[11:16:31] <ruz1> it makes really no-sense
[11:16:32] <ruz1> to me
[11:16:47] <ruz1> .me == ok "you"
[11:16:58] <ruz1> .io == input/output :/ so ??
[11:17:15] <[jmc]> well, "low-level" communication facilities of some kind
[11:17:15] <Cronoh> socket.io makes sense :)
[11:17:19] <ruz1> i really hate .io sorry, really no-sense domains
[11:17:31] <ruz1> @Cronoh well also webservice.ws
[11:17:35] <ruz1> but are rare
[11:17:41] <Cronoh> lol
[11:17:46] <ruz1> i saw domains really bad
[11:17:47] <shoky> who gives a shit.
[11:17:49] <BillCriswell> I'm just look forward to .butt
[11:17:56] <ruz1> like fusion.io
[11:18:00] <ruz1> what the fuck this means??
[11:18:09] <ruz1> does they think they registered a cool domain?? :/
[11:18:09] <Cronoh> it looks cool
[11:18:15] <ruz1> why??????????????
[11:18:17] <ruz1> :D
[11:18:19] <Cronoh> idk
[11:18:27] <Cronoh> something non standard and short and easy to say about .io
[11:18:30] <Cronoh> makes it looks nice to me
[11:18:31] <[jmc]> I think so, but... well, I don't even care :D
[11:18:38] <ruz1> trigger.io
[11:18:43] <[jmc]> rov.io? :D
[11:18:43] <ruz1> wtf this means????
[11:18:44] <ruz1> :/
[11:18:47] <ruz1> :D
[11:18:49] <BillCriswell> oh.io
[11:18:52] <[jmc]> I bet they didn't think about it at the time
[11:18:55] <NoiseEee> it doesn't *mean* anything more than whatever.com
[11:19:00] <shoky> because .com is so meaningful.
[11:19:03] <NoiseEee> but a) its probably easier to remember   etc
[11:19:04] <ruz1> if you want to register something cool in italian do rocch.io
[11:19:06] <[jmc]> lol rov.io redirects me to bit.ly
[11:19:16] <ruz1> wich is like pen.is
[11:19:24] <BillCriswell> a pen is what?
[11:19:26] <[jmc]> ilvecchiocon.io
[11:19:35] <shoky> mightier
[11:19:35] <ruz1> rocch.io == pen.is (in italian
[11:19:40] <ruz1> big penis
[11:19:46] <ruz1> big cock how to say
[11:19:47] <[jmc]> ruz1: well in some dialect at least :P
[11:19:50] <ruz1> you have 1 rocchio
[11:19:54] <ruz1> rocch.io
[11:19:57] <ruz1> ahahaha damn

[11:20:30] <ruz1> not ofc
[11:20:32] <ruz1> pleasa
[11:20:37] <ruz1> i love chicken
[11:20:59] <[jmc]> no, no kfc for me now, I have just got out of the christmas dinners and stuff
[11:21:05] <ruz1> ahahah
[11:21:10] <ruz1> jmc my best chat friend
[11:21:12] <[jmc]> now abstinence for a little while
[11:21:14] <ruz1> we are both italians
[11:21:15] <ruz1> :D
[11:21:22] <Ved_1> is it valid to do something like this in the ui dialog....... close: function(event, ui){                     alert(ui)$(ui).remove();                 }
[11:21:42] <ruz1> jmc where from?
[11:21:46] <BillCriswell> If you put a semi-colon before the dollar sign, sure.
[11:21:53] <[jmc]> rome
[11:22:03] <ruz1> oh near florence here
[11:22:03] <ruz1>  :D
[11:22:22] <ruz1> batacch.io
[11:22:23] <Ved_1> sorry close: function(event, ui){                     $(ui).remove();                 }
[11:22:31] <ruz1> guys register that is a cool italian domain
[11:22:33] <Ved_1> this should be good
[11:22:38] <ruz1> batacch.io
[11:22:40] <ruz1> not joking
[11:23:08] <ruz1> i can list you some cool italian domains if someone would register that ;)
[11:23:09] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I have any neighbors in here.
[11:23:19] <BillCriswell> Anyone from Philadelphia?!
[11:23:40] <Ved_1> Argentina here lol
[11:23:46] <Cronoh> what about... arizona!
[11:24:20] <ruz1> batacch.io , rocch.io, occhiop.io
[11:24:23] <ruz1> malocch.io

[11:24:54] <shoky> Ved_1: you want $(this).remove() probably
[11:24:56] <ruz1> cool @BillCriswell
[11:25:10] <t432> i have field that I am using ajax to validate, if the valid is not valid, i'd like to prevent submission of form. How can I do this?
[11:25:11] <BillCriswell> aud.io
[11:25:11] <ruz1> why does no one choosed pap.pa
[11:25:18] <ruz1> vide.io
[11:25:26] <shoky> Ved_1: don't use that 'ui' argument without first checking if its really what you want (use console.log)
[11:25:32] <BillCriswell> rat.io
[11:25:40] <ruz1> this is a cool domain vide.io (cause it's no sense as 99% of .io registered domains)
[11:25:47] <BillCriswell> portfol.io woud be a good one maybe.
[11:25:48] <Ved_1> shoky:  let me check
[11:26:02] <ruz1> portafogl.io
[11:26:05] <ruz1> italian
[11:26:15] <BillCriswell> fellat.io ;)
[11:26:19] <ruz1> portfol.io == portafogl.io
[11:26:26] <ruz1> maia.le
[11:26:31] <shoky> stfu plz

[11:26:45] <shoky> ;[
[11:26:58] <sayd> it looks like the behavior where html() was stripping out script tags when they were inside the html of a selected element. Anyone have that bug link? I noticed its fixed in edge

[11:27:43] <ruz1> i think i'll register jqueree.com
[11:27:46] <shoky> ruz1: go write a blog, leave us alone, please
[11:27:54] <ruz1> hahahaha you're right :D
[11:28:09] <ruz1> i was just blaming .io domains then i degenerated

[11:37:22] <ruz1> omg it's a cospiracy
[11:37:23] <ruz1> :/
[11:37:37] <ajpiano> ruz1: from what i can tell, you've shown up in the channel, linked a lot to a different site, and said fuck a lot
[11:37:52] <ajpiano> unless you have something constructive to add, it would be good of you to stop that all
[11:37:54] <ruz1> we where talking about .io
[11:37:57] <ruz1> domains
[11:38:03] <ruz1> for that we posted so much links man
[11:38:13] <ruz1> then yep fuck you're right
[11:38:22] <ruz1> i'm not english so i abuse that
[11:38:23] <ruz1> sorry
[11:38:26] <ajpiano> i hadn't read that far up

[11:38:45] <ruz1> ok
[11:38:52] <ruz1> really strafucking sorry
[11:38:53] <ruz1> !
[11:38:58] <ajpiano> ?offtopic cute TLD ideas and strafucking
[11:38:58] <bot-t1> While a little bit of off-topic banter is generally harmless, extended discussion of cute TLD ideas and strafucking is off-topic for this channel, so let's please move on.
[11:39:00] <ruz1> bye guys
[11:39:16] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: When's the next #jsmovies?
[11:39:20] <ruz1> bot-t1:  are you human?
[11:39:20] <bot-t1> ruz1, My sources say no.
[11:39:24] <ajpiano> i donno
[11:40:31] <ruz1> i joined #javascript
[11:40:39] <ruz1> they uses fuck as much i like ;)
[11:42:00] <BillCriswell> ruz1: They're more strict than here I bet.
[11:42:21] <ruz1> ehehe testing that out :P
[11:42:39] <ruz1> we continue discussing about strafucking .io , now i stop here
[11:43:13] <yedi> how do you AND two selectors together
[11:43:43] <BillCriswell> yedi: Did you mean to type "ADD"
[11:43:44] <shoky> yedi: you concatenate them
[11:43:48] <shoky> with no spaces
[11:43:51] <ruz1> @BillCriswell .io is like to say "hey look at me i have a strafucking no-sense coooool domain"
[11:43:51] <b-ot> ruz1, I am not in "hey.
[11:44:04] <ruz1> ?
[11:44:15] <yedi> shoky: what? that would just form one invalid string..?
[11:44:21] <BillCriswell> ruz1: You're not making much sense to me.
[11:44:39] <BillCriswell> yedi: You can do $('.one, .two') or $('.one').add('.two').
[11:44:45] <ruz1> yep yep i know
[11:44:46] <shoky> thats an OR
[11:44:48] <shoky> not an AND
[11:44:51] <yedi> BillCriswell: no I want to select something that applies to both selectors, not either
[11:44:52] <ruz1> byby :P
[11:45:00] <shoky> yedi:  $('.one.two')
[11:45:01] <yedi> BillCriswell: that;s what i tried
[11:45:05] <shoky> or $('input.someclass')
[11:45:25] <BillCriswell> yedi: $('.one.two') then.
[11:45:27] <shoky> or ('input.class1.class2#someId.class5:visible')
[11:45:31] <shoky> see, concatenated
[11:46:06] <yedi> so this: (".role-dropdown, [data-domain='tp']")
[11:46:13] <shoky> that's an OR..
[11:46:14] <yedi> should instead be this: (".role-dropdown.[data-domain='tp']")
[11:46:15] <BillCriswell> shoky: Would that last one work? It's kind of scary haha.
[11:46:24] <shoky> yedi: almost, drop that middle dot .
[11:46:30] <shoky> dot is for classes only
[11:46:39] <shoky> BillCriswell: dont see why not :P
[11:46:44] <yedi> really? this works? (".role-dropdown[data-domain='tp']")
[11:46:49] <shoky> yep
[11:47:02] <yedi> sweet, thanks, sorry for being skeptical earlier
[11:47:10] <shoky> np ;]
[11:48:20] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Hey Shoky! Anybody know if you can use jquery UI and accordian to have multiple elements "open" at once. Kind of a collapsible behavior rather than an accordian behavior?
[11:48:29] <BillCriswell> shoky: Didn't work on <input id="someId" class="class1 class2 class5" name="name" value="Bill">
[11:48:32] <shoky> woah hey Whirl3d
[11:48:44] <Whirl3d> How goes it shoky?
[11:49:08] <shoky> fine fine, what's up?
[11:49:43] <Whirl3d> Just trying to build a custom interface for a gym. They want to be able to drag/drop excercises into groups
[11:51:08] <shoky> BillCriswell: works for me
[11:51:32] <shoky> Whirl3d sounds fun
[11:51:40] <shoky> sorta ;S
[11:51:52] <BillCriswell> shoky: Including jQuery would have helped.
[11:52:14] <shoky> ;D
[11:53:01] <BillCriswell> It's the little details, you know.
[11:53:07] <Whirl3d> really a pain in the arse. They want it to be simple...mostly cause they are blunted. So I make it simple and they wan to be able to drag and drop exercises..no problem. Then they refuse to have a preset list of excercises, they want custom exercises with rep and weight counters that increment...really?
[11:53:28] <Guest55182> hi
[11:53:39] <Guest55182> i need help ls
[11:53:54] <BillCriswell> I can maybe help pwd.
[11:55:13] <Guest55182> i have var ret = 14, and <button class="art" id="14">, how can access to the css propriety of button with jquery pls
[11:57:41] <NoiseEee> $('#'+ret).attr('class')
[11:58:25] <Guest55182> thanks you
[12:00:31] <shoky> Whirl3d: about your accordion question, this is something i've used in the past (i just modified it now to work with jquery ui 1.9 also)
[12:00:44] <shoky> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/C5Wgu/8/
[12:01:05] <shoky> Whirl3d: it's not a real widget, no events or API. so use only if you dont need the API ;p
[12:07:07] <RangerRick> Does anyone have any suggestions on debugging memory issues? I'm working on a PhoneGap app using knockout and it crashes MobileSafari after receiving the first ajax response and attempting to render a list. The list is 67 items, which I wouldn't think is too massive, but I fear I'm doing something wrong somewhere in my code that's causing things to bloat.
[12:07:13] <RangerRick> I've tried the Chrome 3-snapshot thing, but I'm not finding a whole lot that points to the issue.

[12:29:49] <BillCriswell> The argument passed to the handler is the event object.
[12:33:42] <slick-> how do i get this date picker to break down the month date and year

[12:56:23] <rindolf> Hi all, does jQuery, or one of its plugins, have a way to easily abstract http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1506-yielding-with-javascript-timers/ ?
[13:00:59] <iman> hi, I load a page after click on button with load(); function, i want to force this request just call with ajax not rest, is there any way to do that ?
[13:01:29] <[jmc]> uh?
[13:02:54] <iman> i mean i just want  to load a page with load() function not from it's address in address bar
[13:05:20] <[jmc]> iman: the technique is called pjax (https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/pjax/)
[13:05:38] <BillyAB> Hi
[13:05:41] <iman> [jmc]: thanks dude :)
[13:05:57] <[jmc]> I don't know if jQuery natively offers something for that
[13:06:23] <BillyAB> every time i use the jQueryUI it comes up really big on my site, like all the buttons
[13:07:32] <shoky> BillyAB:  it's cause of your default font-size. jqueryui's site has font-size: 62.5%   on <body>  , for example
[13:07:32] <[jmc]> iman: oh, this might be what you want https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[13:07:51] <BillyAB> yeah just figured that out shoky thanks anyway
[13:12:00] <BillyAB> is there anyway to get around doing the whole body just their bit?
[13:13:24] <Brodingo> twss

[13:20:38] <[jmc]> alexbobp: I don't think so, that is actual mouse movement
[13:21:13] <alexbobp> [jmc]: any way to filter the event after the fact then?
[13:22:49] <[jmc]> I don't know... you could listen on a wheel/mousewheel event and its coordinates and deltas, then add them up and see if the mouseenter/mousemove event has the same coordinates
[13:23:01] <[jmc]> just a wild guess, but why bother that much?
[13:23:22] <alexbobp> yeah that would be an insane hack...
[13:23:33] <alexbobp> it's for a multiselect list
[13:23:43] <alexbobp> you can hilight entries by mousing over them
[13:23:55] <alexbobp> but then if you try to scroll through the list with the arrow keys, and your mouse happens to be over the list, it screws up
[13:24:01] <alexbobp> because every time it scrolls, it selects what your mouse is over
[13:24:36] <[jmc]> are you sure that mouseenter gets fired when you scroll?
[13:24:45] <[jmc]> intuitively, I'd say that it shouldn't
[13:24:53] <[jmc]> if so you could listen on mouseenter only
[13:25:16] <prefix> [jmc] is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[13:25:31] <prefix> [jmc] Does it need to be JSONP?
[13:25:59] <[jmc]> prefix: yeah you need to respect the same origin policy; jsonp could be a solution, if the remote server supports it
[13:26:24] <[jmc]> (it needs to surround the response with the callback function name that you provide to it, so it isn't automatic)
[13:26:35] <prefix> [jmc] ok, how would I use getJSON with JSONP
[13:27:29] <[jmc]> prefix: use $.ajax
[13:27:32] <shoky> prefix:  try adding "?callback=?"  to the url
[13:27:38] <shoky> or use $.ajax, yup
[13:27:44] <shoky> with dataType: 'jsonp'
[13:27:49] <[jmc]> $.ajax({dataType: "jsonp", url: "someurl", etc...})
[13:28:00] <fission6> how would i fadeOut whats inside a div, not the div iteself
[13:28:04] <fission6> children()
[13:28:11] <shoky> but $.getJSON('...?callback=?'... should work fine too
[13:28:13] <alexbobp> jmaister: yeah mouseenter is getting fired when I scroll
[13:28:16] <[jmc]> children().each(function () {...})
[13:28:23] <shoky> unless you need to specify a differnet jsonp callbackname or someth
[13:28:30] <alexbobp> sorry, [jmc]
[13:28:43] <[jmc]> shoky: well, if the server expects that parameter ofc
[13:28:45] <alexbobp> [jmc]: I changed from mouseenter to mousemove thinking it wouldn't fire on scrolling.  but they both do.
[13:29:02] <[jmc]> alexbobp: hmm let me try on a quick jsbin
[13:29:02] <shoky> [jmc]  dataType:'jsonp'  will add that parameter too
[13:29:03] <alexbobp> (on chromium by the way)
[13:29:13] <alexbobp> [jmc]: okay
[13:29:26] <[jmc]> shoky: hmm good point :D
[13:32:25] <prefix> [jmc] / shoky I am getting a 403 (Forbidden) when I do 	var soundcloudstream = $.ajax({dataType: "jsonp", url: soundcloudstreamrequesturl})
[13:32:40] <prefix> soundcloudstreamrequesturl = the API request URL
[13:32:56] <Krambiorix> hi, i got an error: myfoo is not defined. How can i check in an if clause against this?
[13:33:01] <[jmc]> alexbobp: dumb test really, but I can't see the index getting higher when I scroll on the <h1> http://jsbin.com/edit/243/
[13:33:46] <[jmc]> Krambiorix: typeof myfoo !== "undefined"
[13:33:55] <[jmc]> but this is not jquery-related
[13:35:42] <[jmc]> prefix: well I see soundcloud has its own js sdk http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs
[13:36:18] <[jmc]> prefix: which you probably need to use to authorize your application first, then make all the request you want
[13:36:38] <[jmc]> prefix: clearly you're not authorized for the sc api then, and it refuses to process your request
[13:39:03] <prefix> interesting
[13:39:20] <[jmc]> prefix: hmm well actually I'm now looking at this http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs#crossdomain
[13:39:21] <prefix> [jmc] I can pass the API access url into my browser to get a track just fine
[13:39:21] <bot-t1> prefix, crossDomain in IE9 is interpreted wrong - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 5 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12097
[13:39:31] <[jmc]> prefix: maybe you miss the client_id parameter?
[13:39:43] <[jmc]> anyway you will still need to register your application to get that id
[13:39:49] <prefix> sec
[13:40:01] <[jmc]> sure
[13:40:43] <kripster> hi guys
[13:40:54] <rmill> guys hi
[13:40:56] <wiherek> hi, any link where I can upload JSON then access it raw over http?
[13:41:16] <Gho5t> waht
[13:41:16] <[jmc]> pastebin raw links? :D
[13:41:20] <[jmc]> but, why?
[13:42:00] <wiherek> testing a module, analytics will post raw json through a restful interface and need to access it from another system
[13:42:46] <FrozenFire> Anyone know of a simple solution for doing a scrolling film-strip type thing? I had planned to simply use an hover bind which animates the margin-left of the first child to a negative value
[13:42:54] <FrozenFire> But I'm finding that there's a great deal of complexity involved in that
[13:43:20] <wiherek> [jmc], pastebin raw links work great, thanks
[13:43:33] <[jmc]> yw
[13:43:39] <wiherek> or lol almost
[13:43:42] <wiherek> its still html
[13:43:50] <wiherek> arg, i need json
[13:43:55] <[jmc]> html?
[13:43:59] <wiherek> yea
[13:44:00] <[jmc]> ah, the content-type?
[13:44:22] <wiherek> hmm the output
[13:44:50] <kripster> could someone tell me why this styling isn't working correctly http://jsfiddle.net/pnS87/13/? thx
[13:46:01] <[jmc]> wiherek: maybe try this, it will correctly return text/plain instead of text/html which makes no sense for raw pastes: http://paste.chakra-project.org/3638/13577678/raw/
[13:46:28] <rmill> kripster: it is working.
[13:46:43] <kripster> i want it to increase the size of the buttons, not the space inbetween
[13:46:45] <rmill> button1 has a height of 250px in the DOOOM
[13:46:47] <wiherek> i actually need application/json
[13:47:30] <rmill> kripster: like dis? http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[13:47:34] <rmill> LOOKS WEIRD :s
[13:49:11] <kripster> #rmill:yeah now see this is where i get lost, what is the easiet way for me to get the class of that button, google chrome goto developer tools and select inspect element??
[13:49:58] <rmill> kripster: yea
[13:51:19] <rmill> jQuery mobile applies that stuff, so if you want to override it, you need to get the classes from the DOM
[13:51:26] <rmill> Or, just know what they are, I guess?
[13:51:36] <prefix> ok
[13:51:38] <jost> On my page, there is a div that contains an iframe, which contains input elements. For some reason, these input elements don't get focus, so the editing caret does not appear in text fields. On the other hand, radiobuttons work as expected, but submit-buttons don't (but hovering effects are there for submit buttons). Any idea what the problem could be?
[13:51:42] <prefix> it looks like I am getting somewhere
[13:52:01] <prefix> how do I return the URL from var soundcloudstream = $.ajax({dataType: "jsonp", url: soundcloudstreamrequesturl}) though
[13:52:13] <kripster> rmill#if i inspect the element of the radio buttons its class="ui-btn ui-radio-off ui-corner-left ui-btn-hover-c ui-btn-up
[13:52:30] <kripster> so what i use just the start of the class
[13:53:52] <rmill> kripster: that isn't one class, it's five seperate ones
[13:54:04] <prefix> it looks like I get a success, so I just need to extract the URL
[13:54:11] <prefix> what is the process for this?
[13:54:41] <rmill> kripster: a bunch of those change depending on state, I believe ui-btn is the only one that remains static
[13:54:55] <kripster> ok, so say i want to change the colour of hovering on that button i use ui-btn-hover-c?
[13:55:39] <shoky> prefix: not sure what you mean
[13:55:56] <rmill> kripster: ui-btn-up-c changes to ui-btn-hover-c
[13:56:01] <rmill> on hover
[13:56:05] <alexbobp> [jmc]: I had to modify your test by adding a bunch of newlines so I could scroll
[13:56:14] <prefix> shoky when I make the API request, a URL to an mp3 is returned. How can I get that URL
[13:56:18] <alexbobp> [jmc]: but I can make it increment just scrolling on and off with the arrow keys without touching the mouse
[13:56:39] <shoky> prefix: oh, you need to look in the response data, which should be passed as argument to your success callback
[13:56:44] <[jmc]> alexbobp: ah sorry, you mean scrolling the page, I was moving the mouse wheel on it...
[13:56:53] <alexbobp> ahh
[13:56:53] <kripster> sorry i am confused rmill, so i use both of those classes, apologies for my ignorance, am a newbie
[13:57:03] <alexbobp> [jmc]: yeah when the page itself scrolls to bring the mouse onto an element
[13:57:15] <alexbobp> [jmc]: I want something that only triggers if the cursor moves
[13:57:19] <prefix> shoky can you explain a little more? how should I pass "callback" into the ajax request
[13:57:28] <sampaka> is it posible to change several text field values with one click on a button. function transferdata(){$('#edit-1').val('79');	$('#edit2').val('12');} for now it only changes the first value
[13:57:36] <rmill> kripster: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[13:57:37] <shoky> prefix:  $.ajax(...).done(function(data) {  console.log(data) })
[13:57:53] <rmill> You can just edit the styles in `jquery.mobile-1.2.0.min.css` directly
[13:58:01] <rmill> to avoid using `!important`
[13:58:04] <shoky> ?ajax @ prefix
[13:58:05] <bot-t1> prefix, jQuery.ajax(url, [settings]): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[13:58:48] <prefix> shoky so: $.ajax({dataType: "jsonp", url: soundcloudstreamrequesturl}).done(function(data) {console.log(data) })
[13:59:02] <shoky> prefix: yes, that should log to your console the response object
[13:59:21] <shoky> prefix:  and to access specific fields, you just use 'data' as a regular object
[13:59:23] <kripster> rmill: thats the same jsfiddle you sentfrom b4?
[14:00:53] <prefix> shoky I am getting an "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unxepected Token ILLEGAL"
[14:02:57] <shoky> prefix:  in your devtools network tab, look at the request, what does the response look like?
[14:03:57] <shoky> prefix: or.. where is that error coming from?
[14:04:05] <prefix> chrome
[14:04:21] <shoky> yeah, but does it show you where in the code it comes from
[14:04:36] <prefix> sjww7gm16f5m.128.mp3:1
[14:04:48] <shoky> heh
[14:04:50] <prefix> which is part of the received mp3 url
[14:05:01] <shoky> pastebin your code
[14:05:08] <prefix> perhaps something isn't escaping properly?
[14:05:33] <shoky> i'm not sure.. right now it looks like you're trying to parse an mp3 as json or something :P
[14:05:38] <prefix> http://pastebin.com/HVj9rtvh
[14:05:46] <prefix> that's possible
[14:05:54] <prefix> I just need the URL from that request
[14:06:43] <kripster> one last question, thx for your help rmill, say for instance i just want to change the size of one of the buttons,can i add a use the div and then the class, for example #button1.ui-btn
[14:06:59] <prefix> so I send http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/72186759/stream?client_id=myapikey&callback=?
[14:07:21] <prefix> and I am redirected to a mp3 at a URL
[14:07:26] <prefix> I need that URL though
[14:07:34] <shoky> there's a lot of data in the response
[14:07:40] <shoky> https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks.json?client_id=4ead13387d69695b62b1168c307f222d&callback=bla
[14:08:19] <prefix> just use
[14:08:21] <prefix> http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/72186759/stream?client_id=4ead13387d69695b62b1168c307f222d&callback=?
[14:08:39] <prefix> that returns the URL to the actual mp3
[14:08:46] <shoky> uh
[14:09:28] <shoky> that's just an HTTP redirect man
[14:09:37] <prefix> ok
[14:09:44] <shoky> no JSON or JSONP here
[14:09:53] <prefix> how can I capture the http redirect url?
[14:09:53] <shoky> so deinitely not getJSON
[14:11:06] <shoky> i donno
[14:11:07] <shoky> ;]
[14:11:25] <prefix> damn
[14:12:44] <shoky> why do you need the url?
[14:13:05] <prefix> I need it for a streaming media player
[14:13:10] <kripster> could someone tell me how to say for instance change the size of one of the buttons,can i add a use the div and then the class, for example #button1.ui-btn http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[14:13:29] <shoky> prefix:  and what's wrong with the first url
[14:13:36] <asdasd> Hi, are there a jquery expert some can help me with simple input field?
[14:13:40] <prefix> shoky the first URL isn't an mp3
[14:13:45] <shoky> prefix: it redirects to an mp3
[14:15:02] <shoky> asdasd: ask
[14:15:18] <asdasd> shoky can i send url its are private
[14:15:40] <shoky> asdasd: if its so simple i'm sure you can make a public jsfiddle
[14:15:54] <asdasd> no its not very smple
[14:16:00] <shoky> eh ok.
[14:18:35] <kripster> rmill you gone?
[14:18:50] <prefix> shoky because I need to put the exact mp3 URL in the "rel" field
[14:19:02] <sampaka> can i change two values of a field with one click on a button?
[14:19:14] <sampaka> two values of two fields!
[14:20:26] <shoky> prefix: you're sure you can't use the first one?
[14:20:37] <prefix> shoky yep
[14:20:47] <shoky> sampaka: you can do as many things as you want with one click on a button
[14:21:01] <dwboutin> Awesome!
[14:21:07] <dwboutin> Hi everybody
[14:21:09] <dwboutin> ^^
[14:21:52] <sampaka> shoky: my function transferdata(){$('#edit-1').val('79');	$('#edit2').val('12');}  only changes #edit-1 - syntax problem?
[14:21:53] <kripster>  could someone tell me how to say for instance change the size of one of the buttons,can i add a use the div and then the class, for example #button1.ui-btn http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[14:22:19] <BillCriswell> sampaka: That should change both. Are you sure you don't want edit-2?
[14:22:48] <shoky> sampaka:  wrong selector maybe?
[14:22:50] <sampaka> i want to change both but it does not do it
[14:22:53] <shoky> ah BillCriswell said it
[14:23:04] <shoky> sampaka:  edit2 edit-2
[14:23:05] <sampaka> i will check!
[14:23:15] <BillCriswell> If that's not the issue, it should be.
[14:23:29] <BillCriswell> Cause I'd curse at that for hours just on principle.
[14:23:55] <sampaka> ok! wrong selector ;)
[14:27:12] <ziyadb> Good evening guys! Hi sampaka, sampaka, BillCriswell.
[14:27:21] <BillCriswell> Evenin'
[14:28:08] <kripster> could someone help with a styling issue for jquery mobile please
[14:28:19] <badbandit> anyone ever had interview with google?
[14:28:38] <prefix> anyone know how I could get a redirect URL using jquery?
[14:28:43] <BillCriswell> I can't even get an interview at the deli.
[14:28:50] <Krambiorix> Hi, when i hover a dialog button, i want it to show the cursor: pointer... I tried to set the CSS on element .ui-button.ui-state-hover  but that doesn't do much... How can i do that?
[14:29:16] <[jmc]> prefix: you'd need to parse the HTTP headers, so I guess that it would be best to do this on the server side
[14:29:32] <[jmc]> prefix: like, client â your server â soundclound â your server â client
[14:29:35] <prefix> [jmc] can't do it on the server side
[14:29:45] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: .ui-button.ui-state-hover:hover {} maybe?
[14:29:49] <prefix> I have to do it all on the client side
[14:30:04] <[jmc]> I don't know how to do that, then
[14:30:12] <[jmc]> I don't even know if it possible :)
[14:30:31] <prefix> hm
[14:30:43] <alexbobp> [jmc]: in case you care, I found a great workaround: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8761730/webkit-firing-mousemove-event-unexpectedly-mouse-not-moving
[14:30:54] <BillCriswell> prefix: Is this through like.. an ajax request? Or you need to get a header on the page you're on?
[14:31:25] <[jmc]> alexbobp: ah, good to know :) similar approach to mine, but simpler
[14:32:11] <prefix> BillCriswell basically, I make an API request (to soundcloud), and upon success, am redirected to a URL that contains an MP3
[14:32:14] <[jmc]> alexbobp: but actually you don't need to pollute the window object, you could capture two variables in a closed scope
[14:32:58] <prefix> the odd thing is that I can see the URL if I console.log the API request
[14:33:00] <quijote> I feel pathetic and I am developing a distate for JS. I have two variables boath are floats which typeof() says are Numbers yet when I add them NaN is returned.
[14:33:19] <rmill> kripster: Sorry
[14:33:29] <rmill> my client doesn't highlight if you do rmill#
[14:33:38] <shoky> prefix: when you do an ajax request to the first URL, the browser automatically does the redirection, and will just start downloading the mp3 or something
[14:33:53] <prefix> hm
[14:33:59] <kripster> krambiorix: do you know how to do the following: how to change the size of one of the buttons,can i add a use the div and then the class, for example #button1.ui-btn http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[14:34:07] <prefix> but there's no way to get the redirect URL though?
[14:34:22] <prefix> redirect URL = URL at which the mp3 is located
[14:34:49] <kripster> rmill: sorry rmill, i'm trying to do the following, how to change the size of one of the buttons,can i add a use the div and then the class, for example #button1.ui-btn http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/17/
[14:35:10] <rmill> kripster: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/serio/pnS87/20/
[14:35:15] <shoky> prefix: usually http clients (such as a streaming client) should know how to deal with redirects
[14:36:34] <prefix> shoky ok. well, how would I deal with this?
[14:36:49] <kripster> rmill: legend
[14:37:03] <BillCriswell> prefix: If you do var r = $.get('https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks.json?client_id=4ead13387d69695b62b1168c307f222d'); r.getAllResponseHeaders(); you can see what response headers are sent.
[14:37:15] <shoky> prefix: you'd use the first url. i dont know how to get the redirect url cleanly
[14:37:42] <shoky> BillCriswell that looks weird
[14:38:04] <shoky> BillCriswell: how would there be any response headers if there hasn't been a response yet
[14:38:33] <[jmc]> a redirect is still an HTTP response
[14:38:40] <[jmc]> one without body, but anyway
[14:38:49] <shoky> but there was no http response yet
[14:38:49] <prefix> BillCriswell I am getting "null"
[14:38:51] <kripster> rmill: so if its better to change the actual default jquery mobile css then i would search for ui-btn to change the default size for that style of radio button?
[14:38:53] <shoky> after doing $.get
[14:38:55] <shoky> it's asynchronous
[14:39:20] <shoky> anyway, doing a $.get  on an mp3 will download that mp3 :\
[14:39:23] <shoky> which is not his intention
[14:39:40] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I don't know what's going on fully I guess haha.
[14:39:56] <prefix> I just need the redirect URL to the mp3 file
[14:40:55] <BillCriswell> prefix: The "stream_url"?
[14:41:18] <prefix> no, the URL that stream_url redirects to
[14:43:25] <shoky> BillCriswell: he's not talking about the url you just used in $.get
[14:43:35] <kripster> does anyone have any experience of changing the jquerymobile css?
[14:43:46] <shoky> BillCriswell: he's talking about   http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/72186759/stream?client_id=4ead13387d69695b62b1168c307f222d
[14:45:18] <BillCriswell> So the goal is to find out what directed him to that url?
[14:45:33] <prefix> the goal is to find the new URL
[14:45:34] <shoky> if you load that url, you'll be redirected to another url
[14:45:41] <shoky> he wants that one
[14:45:59] <Kalculus> I have a problem...  I'm doing .is(":checked") during an onClick of a checkbox.  In IE8, when the user clicks the checkbox, it returns the value before the change.  In IE9, it returns the value after the change.  What's the most reliable way to handle this?
[14:46:21] <Kalculus> I want the new value of the checkbox
[14:46:27] <shoky> Kalculus: tried 'change' event?
[14:46:56] <Kalculus> well.. in IE, that only gets called when the checkbox loses focus
[14:47:16] <shoky> shrugs
[14:47:16] <b-ot> Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
[14:47:25] <Kalculus> it doesn't get called when the value of the checkbox changes
[14:47:34] <prefix> this is so bad
[14:47:41] <johnline> â¬âââ¬ï»¿ Â¯\_(ã)
[14:50:14] <BillCriswell> Kalculus: Is that's true I have a lot of scripts I need to fix otu there.
[14:50:18] <prefix> would this work? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6136534/getting-the-actual-url-after-a-post-which-redirected-using-jquery-ajax
[14:52:09] <prefix> BillCriswell should a response header exist?
[14:52:17] <shoky> prefix: would what work?
[14:52:31] <prefix> shoky something like this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6136534/getting-the-actual-url-after-a-post-which-redirected-using-jquery-ajax
[14:52:43] <Krambiorix> kripster, thanks but i add the buttons as a parameter to the dialog
[14:52:43] <shoky> prefix: something like what?
[14:52:55] <prefix> shoky do you not see my link?
[14:53:00] <shoky> prefix: i do..
[14:53:08] <shoky> prefix: doesnt look like you've seen it though :)
[14:53:50] <prefix> err?
[14:54:16] <shoky> prefix: in that link, there is 1 question and 2 answers.  which are you referring to?
[14:54:30] <prefix> the first answer
[14:54:40] <shoky> prefix: what about it ? adding your own header to the response..?
[14:54:45] <shoky> what does that have to do with your issue.
[14:55:14] <prefix> it appears that the person was able to get the redirect URL
[14:55:40] <shoky> are you intentionally not reading the full answer?
[14:56:10] <Kalculus> BillCriswell: it might be ok if you're using the jquery event handlers.  not totally sure though
[14:56:12] <prefix> I think I may not understand it
[14:56:32] <shoky> prefix: anyway that doesn't help you
[14:56:45] <BillCriswell> I don't think they want you using http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/72186759/stream?client_id=4ead13387d69695b62b1168c307f222d
[14:56:49] <prefix> ok
[14:56:55] <prefix> lets take a step back
[14:57:25] <BillCriswell> I do see a "location" response header that you're redirected to, but there's no way to get at it.
[14:57:47] <Krambiorix> can someone help me? I can't seem to make the cursor set to pointer when i hover my buttons in my dialog.  I call dialog like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ERLFL/
[14:58:23] <prefix> is there a way to perform a serverside function and return the data so that it is useable by jquery?
[14:58:35] <div3984> hi, on this site, http://brightnight.us there is jquery replacing the two forms on the left of the screen.  id like to not have the old html forms pop up for a second before the jquery kicks in.  i tried a 'display: none' inline style on the form and div and it removes the html form like i want, but then the jquery is not displayed, which i dont want.  any suggestions?
[14:58:53] <chilversc> prefix: I prefer not to use redirects with ajax
[14:59:16] <prefix> BillCriswell the stream mp3 url changes every 6 minutes, so I need to get a new URL every time a player is set to active
[14:59:58] <chilversc> prefix: instead I like to return a 201 Created response with a Location header (if a resource was actually created)
[15:00:10] <BillCriswell> Night dudes.
[15:00:32] <prefix> chilversc I can't really so muhc about that in this case. I am working with the soundcloud API, which forces redirects
[15:05:35] <chilversc> prefix: doesn't look like there's much you can do without doing what's already been suggested, adding a custom header to say where you got the data from
[15:06:06] <prefix> chilversc I can't do that if I don't control the source server, right?
[15:06:27] <chilversc> prefix: nope
[15:07:15] <chilversc> prefix: you're trouble here comes from the spec, the XMLHttpRequest spec doesn't provide a final URL in the response, and it says redirects are handled transparently, with no override to turn them off
[15:07:50] <chilversc> prefix: I think the intention is, the client doesn't need to know about the redirect, because the URL it used is perfectly valid, and it does get the response in the end
[15:08:03] <prefix> hm
[15:09:14] <prefix> ok\
[15:09:20] <prefix> I wonder what I can do then
[15:10:22] <chilversc> prefix: and looking at their API http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api#playing you shouldn't need to know that URL?
[15:11:46] <prefix> currently, my media player needs an mp3 URL in order to play
[15:14:38] <prefix> I wonder though....
[15:14:54] <[jmc]> night
[15:14:57] <prefix> what if I issue a get request when setting the mp3...
[15:17:06] <shoky> prefix: what media player?
[15:17:12] <prefix> jplayer 1.2
[15:17:59] <chilversc> prefix: yeah, it looks like they got their streaming api to work using flash
[15:18:22] <shoky> prefix: it works just fine with the first uerl
[15:18:23] <shoky> url
[15:18:41] <prefix> shoky the first URL?
[15:18:49] <shoky> at least with jplayer 2.2
[15:19:03] <shoky> prefix: yes, the pre-redirect url
[15:19:12] <shoky> prefix: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Q4LMV/17710/
[15:20:52] <prefix> setmedia
[15:21:27] <shoky> yes, http://jplayer.org/  says it on the main page
[15:21:47] <danheberden> is that some kind of jewish only player?
[15:21:52] <shoky> xD
[15:22:15] <danheberden> it's the companion website to jdate
[15:22:42] <prefix> jplayer 1.2 doesn't have setmedia
[15:23:00] <shoky> well, jquery is the companion jslib i suppose :P
[15:23:42] <shoky> prefix: im pretty sure it can handle redirects too. otherwise.. now you know what to do. (upgrade)
[15:24:15] <prefix> shoky how would I confirm that jplayer 1.2 cannot handle redirects?
[15:24:16] <div3984> hi, on this site, http://brightnight.us there is jquery replacing the two forms on the left of the screen.  id like to not have the old html forms pop up for a second before the jquery kicks in.  i tried a 'display: none' inline style on the form and div and it removes the html form like i want, but then the jquery is not displayed, which i dont want.  any suggestions?
[15:26:59] <BinaryKitten> div3984 in the load part
[15:27:19] <BinaryKitten> on the form   .css('display', null)
[15:27:39] <BinaryKitten> or .show()
[15:30:31] <shoky> prefix: it works
[15:30:48] <prefix> shoky it works with 1.2?
[15:30:56] <prefix> do you use setfile?
[15:31:00] <shoky> prefix: yeah
[15:31:06] <prefix> can you show me the code?
[15:31:35] <shoky> prefix: http://jplayer.org/1.2.0/demo-01/
[15:32:00] <shoky> prefix: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/Q4LMV/17713/
[15:32:55] <prefix> hm
[15:32:57] <prefix> interesting
[15:34:43] <shoky> like i said at the very beginning, most normal http clients will be able to follow redirects
[15:34:56] <div3984> BinaryKitten hi can you elaborate a bit please
[15:34:59] <prefix> veeeery interesting
[15:35:23] <BinaryKitten> div3984 not really
[15:35:57] <BinaryKitten> if you have display: none, you need to remove it
[15:36:03] <prefix> I must have a problem with my code elsewhere
[15:36:07] <BinaryKitten> either of those two calls will do it
[15:36:24] <div3984> BinaryKitten i dont have display: none any longer
[15:36:32] <div3984> before i wrote my original post
[15:38:02] <zatan> hey how can I load load first 20 images on scroll load next 20 ?
[15:38:38] <div3984> BinaryKitten so i have display: none on the css then i remove that with the jquery, is that what youre saying?
[15:39:23] <BinaryKitten> div3984 no clue as you changed the parameters of the question
[15:40:10] <div3984> BinaryKitten would that work though?
[15:40:17] <BinaryKitten> no clue. sorry
[15:40:31] <BinaryKitten> it's 23:40 time for me to shut brain off
[15:40:55] <shoky> you're welcome, prefix
[15:41:07] <prefix> :) thanks shoky you just made my night
[15:41:19] <prefix> I just tested it
[15:41:21] <prefix> and it works!
[15:41:42] <shoky> sweet ;]
[15:41:45] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[15:42:20] <rmill> UR a triumph of the human spirit
[15:44:22] <coldhead> why thank you
[15:45:40] * shoky sits on coldhead
[15:47:41] <tw2113> cruel and usual punishment!
[15:50:02] <fission6> can i get a quick review of this http://dpaste.org/w8oGI/
[15:54:03] <MistuhKurtz> fission6, not available
[15:55:08] <fission6> oh
[15:57:07] <grafi> thats a no then
[15:57:08] <grafi> :p
[16:14:58] <KWhat_Work> good morning,  Is it possible to detect a 301/302 redirection in the completed callback for .load ?
[16:15:28] <coldhead> i don't think so, KWhat_Work
[16:19:00] <manou> hello, there is a div at the main file that it is filled through ajax with ul/li elements. That div has an id, and the click method for this (id li) selector is not working ... any light? thanks in advance for your time
[16:22:54] <KWhat_Work> ehhh its always a rock and a hard place
[16:23:00] <manou> here is some code: http://pastebin.com/index/TyiKRdvC
[16:25:22] <KWhat_Work> manuelbieh: whats not working the click or the hover
[16:25:32] <StanAccy> Ive attached a bounce effect to a series of elements in a horiztonal list (a series of spans).  When the effect fires on an element, I notice a new <div> is being added around the clicked element, which forces a wrap (since the <div> is breaking).  Is there a way to stop that happening (i.e. make the element bounce in place) ?
[16:25:43] <manou> i think it could be because the li elements are created after the click event is defined ... but uhm,... how to achieve ?¿
[16:25:56] <manou> the click KWhat_Work
[16:25:58] <Whirl3d> does anyone know of a good variable-count list form control (you know, where the little + icon lets you add another item to the list)?
[16:26:22] <nFF> ?delegation @ manou
[16:26:23] <bot-t1> manou, If you try to attach an event to an element that doesn't exist in the DOM yet, it will not bind. You need to delegate the event handler to a parent that is in the DOM to look for its children. Look at .on() or delegate() for more info
[16:26:38] <KWhat_Work> manuelbieh: the syntax is #menu_options_carroceria > li and I believe its not working because it was dynamically added
[16:27:07] <Radion> Hi guys how do i join #jquerymobile
[16:27:17] <KWhat_Work> manuelbieh: sorry that was for manou
[16:27:46] <KWhat_Work> wtf, huh tab compete is busted
[16:28:15] <jlembeck> Radion: all help for jquerymobile comes here as well
[16:28:52] <nFF> KWhat_Work btw you should be able to tell 301/302
[16:28:59] <manou> yeah, i know now ... dumm, this afternoon i tried but i get an error .on is not a function ... i realized after 'cos other thing there was a very old jquery version, but i forgot this on thin ... i think i am close now, thanks :) KWhat_Work
[16:29:00] <nFF> just check the response headers
[16:29:03] <gen0cide> Is there a jquery function which centers a div? such as the sites container
[16:29:17] <Radion> Cool thanx im just getting my head around irc for dev
[16:29:25] <KWhat_Work> nFF: it follows the redirect, so the only header you get back is 200 OK
[16:29:32] <nFF> gen0cide its called css :> margin: 0 auto
[16:29:35] <jlembeck> gen0cide: You should use css for that
[16:30:05] <nFF> KWhat_Work can't you check xhr.status on complete and success
[16:30:12] <StanAccy> see here for an example: http://tinkerbin.com/wDIOf1hZ
[16:30:42] <nFF> KWhat_Work, just google'd and you cannot
[16:30:46] <gen0cide> jlembeck: For horizontal and vertical centering?
[16:31:11] <gen0cide> jlembeck: Im trying to get it work on mobile browsers
[16:31:12] <AlbinoGeek> Having a bit of issue with jQuery apparently not updating something on page.
[16:31:38] <StanAccy> how do I stop the inserted effect div breaking and thus causing a wrap?
[16:31:53] <AlbinoGeek> http://partshub.ca/search (any page will do).  If you add any item to your cart, the total in the top right should reflect your total items in cart and the subtotal of the items.  Something that is set using jQuery and an AJAX (json) GET.
[16:31:55] <jlembeck> gen0cide: css things like margins should work on mobile browsers as well, are you just trying to put something in the middle of the screen?
[16:32:08] <nFF> gen0cide, you can do it pragmatically, by setting your margins using height() and width() (/2 obv.)
[16:32:45] <AlbinoGeek> However, the subtotal and items in cart are not changing; and no errors are showing in console.
[16:32:59] <AlbinoGeek> I can see the GET going through, and verified the returned data is JSON and should be read fine.
[16:35:26] <AlbinoGeek> Nevermind, managed a bit of a finicky solution.
[16:35:48] <RA13> StanAccy: you could set .ui-effects-wrapper to display: inline or inline-block
[16:36:10] <StanAccy> RA13: is there any way to scope that to just this component?
[16:36:14] <StanAccy> element rather
[16:37:06] <RA13> I am unsure, it is possible through traversal perhaps
[16:37:39] <StanAccy> RA13: I dont want this localized change to affect all other effects on the page
[16:39:38] <RA13> StanAccy: Yes, I don't know if this is the best solution but something like this could do it http://tinkerbin.com/IN5hbmZa
[16:42:24] <StanAccy> RA13: Thanks!
[16:54:09] <tds5016> hi. Can somoene tell me how I would call this function?
[16:54:10] <tds5016> https://gist.github.com/3581792
[16:54:21] <tds5016> $.parseImagesFromCSS()
[16:54:29] <tds5016> that appears not to work for some reason.
[16:55:55] <shoky> tds5016: $.preload.images()
[16:57:14] <tds5016> whoa.... shoky how in the hell does that become preload.images?!
[16:57:14] <tds5016> haha.
[16:57:29] <shoky> tds5016:  the $.extend does that
[16:57:48] <shoky> tds5016: the parseImagesFromCSS function is local, you can't access it directly
[16:57:51] <shoky> from outside
[16:58:12] <tds5016> where is preload or images() defined?
[16:58:26] <shoky> $.extend({    preload: {      images: function(doc) {
[16:58:35] <tds5016> oh!!!
[16:58:37] <tds5016> I see it now.
[16:58:50] <tds5016> I think my head just exploded.... but I kind of get it.
[16:58:51] <tds5016> haha.
[16:58:59] <shoky> heh
[16:59:04] <tds5016> next question....
[16:59:19] <tds5016> do you know why that isn't allowing images in mobile safari to precache correctly?
[16:59:33] <shoky> pfft. *hides*
[16:59:46] <tds5016> haha. mobile safari is more than slightly lame. I'll be honeest.
[17:00:01] <tds5016> it's kinda really been pissin' me off to be honest. haha.
[17:40:36] <guide_X> i'm doing an ajax post.. except, one of my parameters contains a '
[17:40:41] <guide_X> so it fails there...
[17:40:51] <guide_X> how do I include a ' in a ajax post parameter?
[17:44:28] <coldhead> WHY IS MY BABY SO BAD AT JENGA?!
[17:46:39] <coldhead> ?eval escape("'")
[17:46:44] <bot-t1> coldhead: "%27"
[17:46:48] <coldhead> thanks bot-t1
[17:46:48] <bot-t1> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[17:52:02] <tw2113> hot bot
[17:56:44] <innociv> A comma in the select works as an "or", doesn't it?
[17:59:40] <delinquentme> Ok so I'm attempting to single out a item in a class match  IE   .edit_icon
[18:00:08] <delinquentme> $(".edit_icon")[0].parent() is saying that the object has no parents
[18:00:25] <coldhead> or, yes innociv
[18:00:26] <delinquentme> but $(".edit_icon").parent() works just fine
[18:01:06] <innociv> yeah nevermind, my html wasn't updating.  Sorry/thanks.
[18:01:13] <coldhead> delinquentme: when you do [0], you are getting the raw DOM element
[18:01:24] <coldhead> and parent()/parents() are jQuery methods
[18:01:35] <coldhead> so they won't be available as methods of a raw DOM element
[18:01:43] <delinquentme> ahh make sense
[18:01:57] <coldhead> .eq(0) might work better than [0] for you
[18:02:09] <coldhead> ?eq
[18:02:11] <bot-t1> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[18:02:23] <CoolerOConnor> you can do that with a selector too
[18:02:36] <coldhead> aber sicher
[18:02:59] <delinquentme> coldhead, awesome
[18:03:10] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's all take 5
[18:06:24] <guide_X> say I need to get the text before a selector like in this page ... www.nomorepasting.com/getpaste.php?pasteid=39028
[18:07:09] <guide_X> so when I click 'x' i'm in the selector tagit-close, but I need to get the text before it in tagit-choice
[18:09:49] <shoky> guide_X: ideally you'd change the HTML
[18:10:03] <shoky> guide_X: but you can get it still, e.g. $(this).closest('.tagit-choice').contents().eq(0).text()
[18:10:21] <guide_X> oh cool
[18:10:24] <guide_X> i'll try that thanks
[18:10:35] <guide_X> I can't change the html because i'm using a prebuilt library
[18:10:53] <guide_X> well I could, but then my head will be more above water heh
[18:10:55] <guide_X> thanks
[18:10:59] <coldhead> guide_X: http://jsfiddle.net/nAfBT/
[18:11:43] <shoky> heh why .find('*') and not .children()
[18:12:11] <coldhead> it's my first day using jquery
[18:12:14] <coldhead> shutup, that's why
[18:12:32] <shoky> true
[18:12:43] <guide_X> hmm that code isn't working yet
[18:12:44] <shoky> appoly-loggies
[18:12:54] <shoky> o brother
[18:12:56] <coldhead> find('*') is more didactic
[18:13:16] <guide_X> I get a lot of stuff
[18:13:20] <tw2113> welcome to #jQuery, home of the jQuery, can I select your object?
[18:13:37] <shoky> i want a lot of stuff too
[18:16:02] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/nAfBT/1/
[18:16:12] <coldhead> now you have 2 problems
[18:16:59] <guide_X> i'm doing this, but I get a lot of stuff ... alert($(this).closest('.tagit-choice').contents().eq(0).text);
[18:17:15] <shoky> .text() dude
[18:17:23] <shoky> and stop alerting
[18:17:26] <shoky> console.log
[18:17:29] <coldhead> ?alert
[18:17:30] <bot-t1> Forget alertâuse console.log() in Firebug (or your browserâs built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[18:17:34] <guide_X> ooo
[18:17:36] <guide_X> that worked
[18:17:41] <guide_X> thanks a lot :)

[18:18:12] <coldhead> classic
[18:18:22] <guide_X> whats wrong with alert just out of curiosity
[18:18:27] <guide_X> it's quicker/dirtier
[18:18:37] <guide_X> with console, I have to hit f12 then click on console
[18:18:41] <coldhead> it locks up the browser
[18:18:49] <coldhead> and if you're doing alert() inside a loop
[18:18:50] <grafi> it occurs to me, im just idleing in this channel to see coldhead talk to the bot
[18:18:53] <coldhead> it keeps seizing up
[18:18:57] <guide_X> oh I suppose
[18:19:14] <coldhead> plus alert( some_var_that_is_an_object )
[18:19:18] <coldhead> [object object]
[18:19:28] <coldhead> console.log lets you inspect the object
[18:19:38] <guide_X> that's true, the object object stuff is annotying

[18:22:33] <coldhead> my spine :(
[18:28:10] <relipse> does anyone remember that YUI 2.x datatable sample where they pulsed a dt row a certain color after the changes were made??? i can't find it
[18:30:30] <relipse>  i need to pulse a TR a certain color and then fade it out
[18:38:08] <relipse> how do i fade out a particular background color?
[18:42:51] <coldhead> relipse: i would use two different classes and the animate class feature from jQuery UI
[18:43:22] <coldhead> http://api.jqueryui.com/switchClass/
[18:45:03] <shoky> wtf
[18:45:26] <coldhead> wtf = well that's fantastic?
[18:45:30] <shoky> yes
[18:45:36] <shoky> never knew about that one
[18:45:38] <shoky> This plugin extends jQuery's built-in .switchClass() method.
[18:45:39] <shoky> huh
[18:46:10] <coldhead> that's... false
[18:47:06] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/switchClass
[18:47:18] <coldhead> WHO WROTE THESE DOCS
[18:49:37] <relipse> this works perfectly, but how can i make it slower? $(dt.getTrEl(record)).effect("highlight", { color: "orange"});
[18:51:07] <coldhead> i don't know man, it's my first day using jQuery
[18:52:43] <shoky> relipse: .effect( effect [, options ] [, duration ] [, complete ] )
[18:53:27] <coldhead> i have no idea what i'm going to do for lunch
[18:53:35] <coldhead> nobody understands my pain
[18:53:36] <shoky> eat, hopefully
[18:53:55] <coldhead> yes but whattt
[18:54:03] <coldhead> all i've had today is some cookie dough
[18:54:13] <shoky> pasta of course
[18:54:41] <coldhead> hm that's so crazy it just might work
[18:54:51] <shoky> it must!
[18:58:15] <sheilablackrose> hi peops
[18:58:25] <coldhead> oh god you again
[19:01:36] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[19:01:41] <sheilablackrose> i fel the love
[19:03:12] <sheilablackrose> so how was yr new year
[19:03:17] <sheilablackrose> plan to b nicer this year?
[19:07:40] <sheilablackrose> im having issue with ie. the function   target.slideDown('slow') doesnt seem to work on ie 8
[19:12:55] <nerdsex> closest() is false advertising =/
[19:13:02] <nerdsex> it should go in both directions, not just up
[19:14:02] <sheilablackrose> haha
[19:16:23] <nerdsex> Seriously though. I think that was a poor naming convention. Should be something like 'closestParent()' and closestChild()
[19:17:01] <tw2113> http://thanpol.as/javascript/you-dont-need-dom-ready/
[19:19:15] <snover> tw2113: whoa. how old is that article.
[19:19:56] <snover> crazy inaccurate
[19:20:04] <nerdsex> not that old
[19:20:23] <nerdsex> the link at the bottom leads to an example page, where he says 'gangnam style'
[19:20:30] <nerdsex> so, sometime after gangnam style was written
[19:20:48] <nerdsex> i mean, up on youtube
[19:21:26] <sheilablackrose> nyone got  afix for .slideDown() for ie 8
[19:22:09] <snover> well for anyone following along at home, browsers make 6 to 8 connections per hostname, other downloads are not blocked when a script tag is encountered, most modern browsers will opportunistically parse content after a script assuming it will not call document.write and then execute a penalty round if it does
[19:22:32] <snover> soooooo.
[19:23:31] <shoky> sheilablackrose: works for me.
[19:23:40] <shoky> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/qaXaA/
[19:23:44] <shoky> er
[19:23:59] <sheilablackrose> let me see
[19:23:59] <shoky> i did check on xp. maybe i should actually check on IE instead of chrome tho :P
[19:24:06] <sheilablackrose> lol
[19:24:14] <sheilablackrose> it works on chrome firefox n ie 9 n 10
[19:24:25] <sheilablackrose> 8 is being a nuisance
[19:24:30] <shoky> ok it works fine in ie8 too.
[19:24:52] <shoky> i bet it works fine in ie6 as well
[19:25:14] <sheilablackrose> loll
[19:25:21] <sheilablackrose> wait
[19:25:23] <sheilablackrose> how is that possible
[19:25:29] <shoky> if you want help, you know the drill, reproduce the issue in a jsfiddle
[19:26:22] <sheilablackrose> it didn twork on 8
[19:26:29] <sheilablackrose> did u change the documentmode
[19:26:30] <sheilablackrose> ?
[19:26:50] <shoky> no
[19:27:00] <sheilablackrose> try it with document mode ie8
[19:27:04] <sheilablackrose> it throw the error
[19:27:08] <shoky> i'm on ie8 document mode
[19:27:47] <shoky> works fine, no errors
[19:29:00] <sheilablackrose> shoky
[19:29:00] <sheilablackrose> http://postimage.org/image/51aakcghz/ef56de97/
[19:29:52] <shoky> are you on compatibility view?
[19:30:20] <shoky> hell. does http://jsfiddle.net  load?
[19:30:52] <sheilablackrose> yup it loads
[19:30:55] <sheilablackrose> but throws the error
[19:30:55] <Whirl3d> Easy way to append text to a span element like .append()  or do I just have to do $("span").text($("span").text()+"new text"); ?
[19:31:12] <shoky> sheilablackrose: then it has nothing to do with .slideDown
[19:31:56] <sheilablackrose> no i mean if i remove slidedown n use .show it loadsfine
[19:32:04] <sheilablackrose> when i change to .slideDown it throws
[19:32:05] <shoky> Whirl3d: what's wrong with .append()
[19:32:12] <sheilablackrose> if i change to ie10 its fine
[19:32:23] <shoky> sheilablackrose: so you're not using ie8?
[19:32:31] <shoky> sheilablackrose: you're using ie10 in ie8 mode..?
[19:32:39] <Whirl3d> wasn't sure if you could append a string...for some reason I thought it had to be an html element....
[19:33:21] <shoky> append should work fine
[19:35:43] <tw2113> no idea snover
[19:36:58] <sheilablackrose> yup
[19:37:07] <sheilablackrose> ie10 in ie8 mode n ie8 document mode
[19:37:13] <shoky> sheilablackrose: then dont say it doesnt work in ie8
[19:37:20] <shoky> sheilablackrose: and stop wasting our time
[19:38:06] <coldhead> great dissection snover
[19:38:52] <aqeel> hi first class
[19:39:26] <sheilablackrose> what sthe diff?
[19:39:44] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[19:40:39] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  one is ie8,  the other is not
[19:40:41] <aqeel> how can i implement the mouse  pressed function such that the fast-forward and rewind can make use of this function and process accordingly
[19:40:51] <shoky> sheilablackrose:  hint:  ie8 is ie8
[19:42:06] <coldhead> is ie8 really worth all this trouble?
[19:42:18] <coldhead> people who use ie8 don't care about whether they see things correctly animated
[19:42:33] <coldhead> they just want to, i don't know, get back to their cars so they can run over baby animals
[19:42:47] <aqeel> not as a viewer but as coder one does care though
[19:42:58] <coldhead> only a young idealistic coder
[19:43:02] <sheilablackrose> i lik eyour take on ie8 users
[19:43:09] <coldhead> a gritty jaded coder doesn't give a rat's arse
[19:43:34] <coldhead> which rat's arse they could easily get from the roadside where an ie8 user had been driving
[19:43:36] <aqeel> well some even go back as to support ie6 for the sake of goodness
[19:43:48] <coldhead> exactly, aqeel, some people are idiots
[19:43:49] <shoky> evilness, you mean?
[19:44:01] <coldhead> some people do their sites to support languages other than english!
[19:44:08] <coldhead> or to support screen readers for blind people!
[19:44:09] <coldhead> hahahahah!
[19:44:26] <coldhead> people only really use facebook anyway
[19:44:39] <coldhead> you can support only firefox 2, it won't matter
[19:44:40] <sheilablackrose> can i do something like if ie 8 or less use .show else use .slidedown?
[19:44:44] <aqeel> you mean yourself right
[19:44:57] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: you can disable animations for ie8
[19:45:03] <aqeel> sheilablackrose: yes you can
[19:45:04] <coldhead> and then the rest of the code will be the same
[19:45:14] <coldhead> ?jquery.fx.off

[19:45:49] <coldhead> if (ie8) $.fn.slideDown = $.fn.show;
[19:46:12] <sheilablackrose> ohh
[19:46:42] <aqeel> for < ie8 you can use comments and create a js file for it and use regular js for ie9<
[19:46:59] <coldhead> you really don't need to go to all the trouble, sheilablackrose, no one using ie8 will ever notice or care
[19:47:10] <sheilablackrose> have to for work
[19:47:36] <sheilablackrose> aqeel what do umean comments
[19:47:52] <sheilablackrose> coldhead how would jquery know if(ie8)
[19:47:52] <sheilablackrose> ?
[19:48:12] <coldhead> do it aqeel's way

[19:48:23] <coldhead> thanks bots
[19:49:05] <sheilablackrose> ok reading that
[19:49:35] <coldhead> i'm readin your statement that you're reading that
[19:50:21] <Whirl3d> anybody got a favorite log function that logs out the basic structure of an element and it's children without all the markup. It's gotten too hard to trapse through console.log(el) anymore (remember I'm old).
[19:57:02] <coldhead> they would not be moved to deliver neither parcel nor telegram
[19:59:57] <aqeel> anyone willing to guide me in getting things done the right way
[20:01:40] <coldhead> yeah tw2113 is
[20:02:25] <aqeel> i would like to use the prepossessed function within the fastforward  method...
[20:02:34] <aqeel> mousepressed*
[20:02:36] <sheilablackrose> coldhead i got the if(IE8||IE7)  but when u say $.fn.slideDown = $.fn.show;  is it changing the function it self?
[20:03:08] <aqeel> sheilablackrose: noooooooooo......
[20:04:23] <sheilablackrose> so its creting a variable with the function?
[20:05:55] <coldhead> it replaces the slideDown function with the show function
[20:06:10] <coldhead> so when you call slideDown you will end up calling show
[20:06:19] <coldhead> as though it were show all along
[20:06:42] <tw2113> onay eakspay englishway
[20:07:25] <aqeel> http://jailbreak.webege.com/js/plugins/aautoscroll.js
[20:07:33] <aqeel> here is the entire thing..
[20:07:42] <sheilablackrose> but if im running it from a js file if (IE 8)  is undefined
[20:08:33] <aqeel> i am making or rather advancing the plugin, has someone any experience with plugins who can help me implement things the right way...
[20:08:48] <coldhead> do it aqeel's way, sheilablackrose
[20:08:51] <coldhead> and he and i both said
[20:09:05] <coldhead> and as you indicated you would do by reading those MS articles
[20:09:41] <aqeel> the mouse pressed is from other plugin but i would like to implement into this plugin as well as to use its functionality
[20:09:47] <sheilablackrose> ok
[20:10:37] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: http://jsfiddle.net/LkdFc/
[20:11:33] <Whirl3d> what is this codemirror script at jsfiddle.net? it keeps throwing errors
[20:13:30] <snover> itâs a script that is designed to throw errors
[20:15:02] <coldhead> that must have some interesting unit tests
[20:16:13] <coldhead> my dirty hands my wicked thirst
[20:18:44] <coldhead> IN THE KITCHEN WHISKEY DRUNK I PRAY TO SOMEONE ELSE'S GOD THAT YOU'LL KEEP QUIET
[20:24:47] <Whirl3d> how can I get console to ad the collapsible triangles to content I log?
[20:25:09] <coldhead> they should be there automatically if you are logging an object
[20:33:54] <Whirl3d> How can I do this better? I want a simple html object heirarchy (just the tags and the classes) in console, look at the last OBJECT http://jsfiddle.net/PXbXx/71/
[20:34:24] <snover> wow, 71
[20:34:47] <Whirl3d> I can't get run to refresh the page
[20:35:57] <hinderaker> How can I get the toggle function in this free html5 template I have to show as default then toggle to close?
[20:36:43] <Whirl3d> hinderaker, how long is a piece of string?
[20:37:01] <hinderaker> Whirl3d: as long as you want it to be ;)
[20:37:05] <coldhead> just long enough to get from one end to the other
[20:37:08] <coldhead> it has to be that long
[20:37:11] <coldhead> it's the law of strings
[20:37:15] <Whirl3d> then you have your answer. .Use the template
[20:37:51] <hinderaker> I really want them to show on default and click to hide.
[20:38:23] <Whirl3d> what free html5 template, for starters.
[20:39:22] <hinderaker> http://pastebin.no/33sg <- link to the script part from the template I think
[20:39:27] <hinderaker> its called "Designa"
[20:42:08] <Whirl3d> add the class "tactive" to the'.toggle'  children elements of the .toggle-view li elements you want shown ?
[20:42:52] <hinderaker> Thanks. I will try.
[20:44:23] <Whirl3d> but then you will need to do something like $(".tactive").parent().slideDown(0);
[20:47:02] <hinderaker> I lost you there. I have never seen one line of javascript before in my life. Been messing around with (x)html and css for years and reading up on some php these days but this is totally new.
[20:47:27] <hinderaker> under <ul> i added class="tactive" to all off the three <li> I have
[20:48:00] <hinderaker> Where does $(".tactive").parent().slideDown(0); go or what does it replace?
[20:50:00] <Whirl3d> just put it right before the code you pasted
[20:52:16] <hinderaker> It is not working. Just get this weird looking arrow pointing down under each of the categories.
[20:52:32] <hinderaker> still working though if you click em they expand
[20:57:10] <hinderaker> no way to tell the whole <ul class="toggle-view"> to stay open as default?
[21:09:07] <Whirl3d> try $(".toggle-view li .toggle:hidden").slideDown(0).children(".toggle-title").addClass("tactive");
[21:10:25] <hinderaker> and put class="tactive" in the main <ul> or the three diffrent <li> ?
[21:11:05] <Whirl3d> that line does it for you
[21:11:40] <Whiskey> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/EvXyj/6/ <-- that was what i wanted, its not 100% accurate but almost so know you now :D
[21:13:17] <hinderaker> Whirl3d: that worked except it didn't trigger the .css to alter the header to "active" (Changes background color if active or not). I can do that manually though by adding class="tactive" on each of them.
[21:13:22] <hinderaker> THanks
[21:14:05] <hinderaker> for the <h5> tag that is
[21:16:19] <hinderaker> Whirl3d: Thanks again. Your a genious!
[21:17:31] <coldhead> genius*
[21:18:54] <hinderaker> :P
[21:32:25] <scar> If I am using Nivo Slider... (i guess any slider, but im using nivo)-- how can i get stuff to appear on TOP of the slides itself? they have a directional nav prev/next that shows fine. im trying to move the controlNav which is outside the s ldier div to where it can appear above the slides
[21:32:28] <scar> for somer eason cant get it
[21:34:38] <tw2113> css would work
[21:35:42] <scar> tw2113, well....
[21:36:48] <scar> tw2113,  i left this trashy so you can still see the control NAv : http://keshia.alomedia.net/
[21:37:38] <scar> i've tried z-index, margin, position... nutten lol
[21:37:47] <scar> its like the nivo jquery is overriding it
[21:38:10] <scar> tw2113, i cant even get the demo to do it: http://nivo.dev7studios.com/demos/
[21:39:00] <coder7of9> i notice slideup hides a div and slidedown shows a div. can this be rebersed?
[21:39:04] <coder7of9> reversed
[21:40:15] <tw2113> i'd wrap the whole slider in a div so that you can keep your css positioning contained to just the slider
[21:41:30] <scar> tw2113, i tried that too... but how would a div sit on top of the slider?
[21:41:48] <tw2113> absolute positioning and z-index
[21:41:58] <scar> hm
[21:44:17] <scar> tw2113, dude... crazy. thanks... not sure why i couldnt get it to work lol... im a goof
[21:44:20] <scar> sleep?
[21:44:49] <raj> to create a new window without an address bar, is that just html (and works in all browsers)?
[21:45:01] <scar> :D
[21:45:27] <coldhead> all these accidents
[21:51:18] <scar> tw2113, you just saved my night lol. i was banging my head against a wall. i knew it was possible.
[21:52:23] <tw2113> sorry for ruining your exercise routine
[22:03:54] <Aqeel> raj, not posible
[22:05:10] <adr682> Hello, I have an odd problem. It seems that when using $.post() and letting it know i want to use "json" at the end. and in my php file I json_encode($myarray). It's picking up my database call information too. And I get a SyntaxError: Unexpected Token < , but if I comment out the rest of my PHP everything goes well with the json. How do I fix this?
[22:08:36] <adr682> Anyone have an Idea how to make it so my $.post() json, isnt picking up the rest of my file that doesnt display. And only picks up my json_encode($myArray);
[22:12:24] <coldhead> i am not sure i understand the question
[22:12:36] <coldhead> eco json_encode($myArray); die();
[22:12:41] <coldhead> echo*
[22:12:56] <coldhead> if you don't want other stuff appearing in the page... don't send other stuff?
[22:13:23] <adr682> but I need to , I'm using database information.
[22:14:21] <adr682> I'm not echoing out or displaying anything except my "echo json_encode($myarray)" but prior to that I have a section of code thats inserting information into a database.
[22:15:10] <adr682> if I comment out my insert to the database my jQuery json works. If I don't comment it out , I get that SyntaxError: Unexpected Token <
[22:15:30] <coldhead> are we talking about something like this http://0bin.net/paste/9c4d1cc00c1d89ad1887832c39f334ce907992d4#985mNY/aDJGCGvTK9sGQGTd3odQZ3/ZcCx5x6ygvbMQ=
[22:15:34] <adr682> on the jQuery end
[22:15:47] <coldhead> your database insert shouldn't be producing any HTML
[22:16:14] <coldhead> i would either try loading the URL which produces the JSON directly in the browser
[22:16:28] <coldhead> or inspect what's coming back to the post() request in the browser's debugger
[22:16:35] <coldhead> find where the mysterion < is coming from
[22:16:37] <coldhead> and get rid of it
[22:17:18] <adr682> Alright. thanks
[22:17:28] <coldhead> good luck there, little fella!
[22:19:41] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, there are so many problems with the link you posted, I don't know where to start.
[22:19:46] <adr682> I just displayed my page with the echo json_encode($myArray); on it and this is all that appeared " {"content":"hello","userName":"One","date":"today"}"
[22:20:33] <Whirl3d> but we should dive in: ID attributes are unique and can only be applied to one element. You have thirty or more div id='block0' elements.
[22:20:42] <adr682> I can't figure out why I'm getting a "SyntaxError: Unexpected Token <"
[22:21:38] <Whirl3d> Whiskey, then you use jquery (in a wierd way) for half of your js and plain js for the second half. The second half, won't work because of the conflicting ids.
[22:25:10] <__machine> how do i get an elements height (including borders)?

[22:36:55] <adr682> coldhead, are you still there?
[22:37:10] <adr682> I figured out where my problem was coming from. Wasnt sure if you had a quick fix.
[22:37:54] <coldhead> what is cuasing it?
[22:37:56] <coldhead> causing*
[22:38:16] <miCSu> I've got a function that gets contents from different pages to a lightbox with ajax. Otherwise works fine, but trying to get data from one single webpage doesn't work on any IE (works on firefox, safari, chrome). The requested html page passes W3 validator. Also the data gotten in success could be logged to console etc, $(data) is identified as an object but $(data).html() is undefined and neither it nor data appends anything on the lightbox
[22:38:16] <scar> mwahaha
[22:38:30] <adr682> When I use a variable inside of the array like so $myarray = array("field" => $var) I get my Sytax error on the jquery side.
[22:39:03] <adr682> but when I just type in what the variables value should be like "value" it works.
[22:39:22] <adr682> Any Idea of why that may be?
[22:41:44] <coldhead> adr682: maybe you should be using php objects rather than arrays?
[22:41:53] <coldhead> i am not really a php person
[22:42:09] <adr682> php objects? Like a class?
[22:42:53] <adr682> Yea array is the described method to be used.
[22:43:17] <adr682> for php side. But I can't figure out why using variables in my array is farking up my jquery
[22:45:43] <coldhead> adr682: can you paste somewhere the actual output from the server which jQuery is receiving?
[22:45:54] <coldhead> you can test that the output is valid json with
[22:45:56] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[22:45:57] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[22:46:10] <coldhead> but if you're making it via json_encode it should be valid
[22:46:56] <adr682> json_encode outputs json data. but for some reason when I use variables it farks up on the jquery end.
[22:47:01] <adr682> I'
[22:47:06] <adr682> I'm baffled heh.
[22:48:31] <adr682> It's gotta be something else I'm doing. I made a dummy test in another project and it works fine.
[22:48:32] <coldhead> "when you use variables"
[22:48:34] <coldhead> what do you mean
[22:49:03] <coldhead> if you use firebug or chrome webinspector you can use the network tab to see exactly what's returned
[22:49:13] <tw2113> coldhead, what are thoughts
[22:49:23] <coldhead> it will probably be some helpful PHP warning like <p>This is deprecated</p>

[22:50:09] <adr682> for some reason on my current project if I use $myArray( "key" => $value ), instead of $myArray("key" => "value")  echo json_encode($myArray); then I get a Syntax token < error.
[22:50:51] <adr682> but in my dummy trial that I did on it outside of my project. I tested it using $value instead of "value" and it works.
[22:50:57] <tw2113> i was told you were in day 2 of philosophy?someone lied!
[22:50:58] <adr682> So it's something else in my project.
[22:51:22] <coldhead> day 2 of philosophy is truth, tw2113
[22:51:27] <tw2113> ohhh
[22:51:32] <coldhead> thoughts are like week 8
[22:51:45] <tw2113> adr682, i'd start checking your $value values
[22:51:50] <coldhead> adr682: you really need to inspect with the network tab to see where the > is coming fro
[22:52:13] <tw2113> does json take htmlentities?
[22:52:25] <coldhead> sure, it just sees strings
[22:52:48] <tw2113> there's an idea adr682, pass your $value through an entities encoding php func
[22:53:02] <coldhead> you're so beautiful but you can't hear me
[22:53:22] <tw2113> sorry, headphoned
[22:53:40] <coldhead> what can i say, i'm attracted to your cans
[22:53:41] <tw2113> listening to a band named Prozzak
[22:53:49] <coldhead> why is that name so familiar
[22:53:59] <coldhead> i'd heard your beloved haim
[22:54:03] <tw2113> they had some hits back in the late 90s
[22:54:29] <tw2113> Prozzak = animated characters with live musicans behind them
[22:54:31] <coldhead> they are recently in my mind
[22:54:42] <coldhead> someone must have mentioned them somewhere or they're touring or something
[22:54:52] <tw2113> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szk2xYIVKrQ <--Prozzak
[22:54:54] <coldhead> i didn't hear any hits in the 90s, i was in a coma
[22:54:56] <tw2113> Haim is awesome though :D
[22:55:04] <coldhead> yes garann put me onto them
[22:55:22] <tw2113> :O The Means knows Haim?
[22:56:29] <coldhead> gnows and larves
[22:58:07] <tw2113> time to compliment her music taste on the twitters
[22:59:06] <adr682> You don't get it. I literally do this $user_name = "one";   $myArray("userName" => $user_name); echo json_encode($myArray);  and I get the "SyntaxError: Unexpected Token <" however if I replace the array Value of $user_name with  the string "one" it works.
[22:59:09] <adr682> what the heck?
[22:59:33] <tw2113> var_dump $myArray
[22:59:54] <adr682> k brb.
[23:00:05] <tw2113> var_dump( json_encode( $myArray) );
[23:00:09] <tw2113> try that too
[23:00:27] <shoky> i dont know php, but doesn't that need to be $myArray = array("userName" => $user_name);
[23:00:32] <coldhead> that's just going to confuse post() even more
[23:00:46] <coldhead> she needs to see the actual output in the debugger
[23:01:24] <tw2113> now i need to get Prozzak on my iphone
[23:02:25] <tw2113> *shakes his booty to the groove*
[23:03:00] <adr682> yes that's what I meant shoky hehe'
[23:03:07] <adr682> Typo. out of being baffled.
[23:03:49] <tw2113> not sure why i didn't notice earlier
[23:03:49] <tw2113> $myArray("userName" => $user_name);
[23:03:56] <tw2113> variable or function?
[23:04:09] <adr682> I type $myArray = array()
[23:04:11] <adr682> It was a typo
[23:04:25] <adr682> http://pastebin.com/HYNieWuT thats my var_dump(); and json_encode();
[23:04:38] <tw2113> so you're doing $myArray = array("userName" => $user_name); ?
[23:04:46] <shoky> adr682:  pastebin 2 things:  the full php,  and the jquery ajax code
[23:04:49] <adr682> I don't get why it's not working. It works perfectly fine when I use variables in another file.
[23:04:56] <shoky> anything else is just wasting time
[23:05:29] <adr682> here I'll post my code.
[23:05:41] <adr682> in pastebin
[23:06:55] <shoky> adr682: and also look at the network tab like coldhead already told you
[23:08:05] <adr682> network tab?
[23:08:11] <adr682> I've only been doing jquery a week.
[23:08:16] <adr682> http://pastebin.com/9TA2tQY6
[23:08:20] <shoky> your browser's devtools network tab
[23:09:25] <shoky> to see what the server is actually responding with
[23:09:33] <coldhead> don't be all "network tab?" about it, i mentioned it at least twice
[23:10:40] <tw2113> and you're sure no < or > is coming in through postContent ?
[23:11:38] <adr682> postContent is a textarea, so w/e can by typed there atm, but I'm just leaving it blank and hitting submit.
[23:11:43] <adr682> for debugging.
[23:11:59] <shoky> adr682: what browser are you using
[23:12:12] <adr682> I have firefox open atm, trying ot find the network tab.
[23:12:32] <tw2113> net tab in firebug
[23:12:36] <coldhead> network tab is in the firebug plugin
[23:12:39] <coldhead> you need to download that
[23:12:44] <coldhead> or use chrome what has one built in
[23:13:45] <tw2113> firefox 18 kind of has one, though not quite as robust
[23:13:58] <tw2113> and not with the inspect dialog
[23:14:21] <coldhead> it does have that cool 3d view though
[23:14:24] <adr682> I'm under the nettab of Firebug
[23:14:34] <coldhead> so you can play with that and foreget what it was you were looking for anyway
[23:14:49] <Justin0908> I'm looking to add an "onclick" event that opens a new page to the radio button widget but am having trouble making it work - anyone have any advice on that?
[23:14:54] <tw2113> they are unifying all of their tools into one common ui in Fx20
[23:14:56] <adr682> I hit submit in firefox. and it says JSON.parse: unexpected character.
[23:15:09] <shoky> adr682: find the ajax request in the net tab
[23:15:22] <shoky> adr682: and find the actual response data
[23:15:27] <Justin0908> I have function that jumps to another page onclick for a regular radio button can I'm having trouble getting it to work with the button widget.
[23:15:28] <coldhead> make sure the tab is open before you submit
[23:15:38] <Whirl3d> I am afraid to even launch firefox any more. It takes a good 15 minutes to apply all the friggin updates every time I launch it.
[23:16:32] <shoky> btw..
[23:16:59] <shoky> you're doing a $.getJSON which sends a GET request.. and then you're looking at $_POST in the php
[23:17:04] <shoky> does that work?
[23:17:12] <adr682> shoky do I find my .php file or my .js file?
[23:17:29] <adr682> I found them both the .js response is just my code.
[23:17:31] <shoky> adr682: the .php i guess..
[23:18:33] <tw2113> shoky, http://store.dieselsweeties.com/collections/coffee-mug-zone :D
[23:19:04] * shoky chuckles
[23:19:23] <adr682> ok I found it, What am I looking for.
[23:19:28] <shoky> adr682: a <
[23:19:37] <shoky> adr682: pastebin the response, in full.
[23:20:00] <adr682> okay.
[23:21:23] <adr682> I have a mysql Error. thats about it.
[23:21:33] <shoky> ?cc
[23:21:34] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[23:21:55] <adr682> http://pastebin.com/9N6s4JTb
[23:21:57] <adr682> lmao
[23:22:08] <shoky> eh.
[23:22:22] <tw2113> $post_content contents?
[23:22:49] <greg5green> :D
[23:23:48] <adr682> tw, herese the full code http://pastebin.com/9TA2tQY6
[23:24:02] <tw2113> i saw earlier
[23:24:02] <tw2113> $post_content = $_POST['postContent'];
[23:24:06] <adr682> If I have a mysql error, I'm guessing I can fix it. but give it a go.
[23:24:20] <tw2113> absolutely no santization of that
[23:24:21] <shoky> where do you see a mysql error
[23:24:27] <aj910martin> I found this good practice for defining and initializing global variables in query http://stackoverflow.com/a/2866920/477522 but I was wondering if I wanted to reset how would that happen? Also, I want them to be loaded only on a call from my $(document).bind('ready', functionâ¦.?
[23:24:40] <shoky> does $_POST get GET query parameters too?
[23:26:12] <shoky> those errors make me think not
[23:26:19] <shoky> change $_POST to $_GET
[23:26:43] <shoky> (or POST from clientside instead of GET)
[23:26:45] <innociv> Is there a way that i can pass data into a click event?
[23:27:13] <tw2113> for you coldhead, keep on learning into day 2 http://store.dieselsweeties.com/products/its-fun-to-use-learning-for-evil-black
[23:27:29] <innociv> I'm triggering a click with .click() and want to know that it was triggered that way.
[23:27:52] <shoky> innociv yeah you can, check .trigger
[23:28:54] <innociv> It's undefined when i click it. Is it something different if i use .click() to trigger it?
[23:29:04] <shoky> wat?
[23:29:04] <b-ot> Why doesn'y apache compile my jquerry?
[23:29:14] <coldhead> wat
[23:29:14] <b-ot> I am having a jsp that contains a jquery tab and inside tab i am having a custom search component on clicking the component a grid will open and it will act as an overlay and i used this plugin to close the grid if the user clicks outside the gridis working perfectly in all other element click other than jquery tab selection component
[23:29:34] <innociv> ev.trigger is undefined
[23:29:41] <shoky> who said ev.trigger
[23:29:51] <shoky> sorry,
[23:29:51] <innociv> well you said .trigger and not .trigger() so i assumed
[23:29:54] <shoky> ?trigger
[23:29:54] <bot-t> .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
