[05:31:29] <lemonsparrow> I have a code to download a json file  blob = new Blob([text], {type: 'text/plain;charset=utf-8' }); but how I can format the json inside the file ?
[05:38:35] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you would have to grab one of the prettyprint libs
[05:38:47] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[05:38:56] <lemonsparrow> Cork: no other way through existing js apis ?
[05:39:04] <Cork> no
[05:39:46] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I have an array of objects and I need to delete an attribute d3 from all objects in the array.. I do arr.forEach(function(v){ delete v.d3 }); but it returns undefined.. why ?
[05:39:56] <lemonsparrow> strange
[05:40:42] <Cork> returns undefined?
[05:40:59] <Cork> you mean the entire array gets remove or what do you mean?
[05:41:20] <pavonia> I think they want .map instead of .forEach
[05:41:21] <lemonsparrow> Cork: [object Object] it only had 1 element..
[05:41:43] <lemonsparrow> pavonia: array.map(function(item) {      delete item.bad;      return item;  });  ??
[05:42:13] <pavonia> Something like that yes
[05:42:39] <lemonsparrow> pavonia: hmm
[05:42:42] <pavonia> If you want it to return a value
[05:43:01] <pavonia> Do we have a bot here?
[05:43:17] <Cork> lemonsparrow: https://jsfiddle.net/oe1uqk1m/
[05:43:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: pavonia map worked
[05:43:47] <Cork> it is waistful though
[05:43:59] <lemonsparrow> Cork: nice.. thanks.. :) but I guess ppl these use lambdas
[05:44:01] <Cork> as it will generate a completely new array
[05:44:04] <lemonsparrow> no ?
[05:44:15] <Cork> lamdas?
[05:44:22] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[05:44:57] <Cork> you can't use forEach cause it gives you a inmutable reference of the object
[05:45:22] <lemonsparrow> Arrow functions
[05:45:32] <Cork> won't really change the problem
[05:45:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: got you..
[05:45:51] <lemonsparrow> Cork: nope.. but lambda expressions I meant Arrow functions :)
[05:46:04] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that depends on the language
[05:46:11] <Cork> in js it doesn't as far as i know
[05:46:25] <lemonsparrow> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions
[05:46:31] <Cork> (in python and ruby it does)
[05:46:43] <lemonsparrow> materials.map(material => material.length);
[05:47:05] <Cork> lemonsparrow: search for "lambda" it gives you 0 hits
[05:47:12] <Cork> i know what arrow or fat arrow functions are
[05:47:20] <Cork> the problem was the lambda reference
[05:48:01] <Cork> (and actually in ruby arrow function and lambdas are related but not identical)
[05:49:08] <lemonsparrow> Im from java background hence may be :)
[05:49:24] <lemonsparrow> is there a shorthand to append a space to back and front of a string ?
[05:53:25] <pavonia> Cork: How do you mean "you can't use forEach cause it gives you a inmutable reference of the object"? You can still change the properties of the objects, no?
[05:54:21] <Cork> pavonia: forEach gives you a reference to the object, if you modify it the changes isn't stored in the original arrays objects
[05:56:09] <Cork> lemonsparrow: not that i know of
[05:56:25] <lemonsparrow> ok
[06:02:30] <pavonia> Cork: This seems to work though: https://jsfiddle.net/oe1uqk1m/1/
[06:04:28] <Cork> hmm
[06:04:57] <Cork> the standard has changed since i looked at it last or it was another method...
[06:05:15] <Cork> anyway what i said was clearly not the case
[07:57:33] <tvm> hi, i know very little about js/jquery, but is this generally wrong? the path seems to be absolute: $.get("/utils/setupreader.php?deviceconfig", function(data){
[07:57:59] <tvm> which in turn prevents the website from working outside the document root, i'm i right ?
[07:58:53] <Cork> tvm: you should normally use absolute urls, else they would be relative to the current url and then you would have to modify the url for each page you load the script in
[07:59:21] <Cork> only exception is if you run it outside of a webserver where you can't use absolute urls
[08:03:34] <tvm> well, i have this website, it uses absolute paths, i can't just put it into /var/www/html/X and expect it to work correctly if the documentroot isn't set to /var/www/html/X
[08:03:44] <tvm> so i kind of answered that to myself, i guess
[08:07:55] <Cork> tvm: its absolute URL not path
[08:08:09] <Cork> js runs in the browser it has no access to the servers filesystem
[08:09:21] <tvm> oh, right, thanks
[08:11:25] <tvm> so it's solvable with mod_rewrite
[08:12:22] <Cork> uh
[08:12:25] <Cork> no
[08:12:34] <Cork> you don't need mod_rewrite either
[08:12:47] <Cork> you just need to use the absolute url instead of the absolute server path
[08:13:07] <Cork> and it would work out normally without special modules
[08:15:10] <tvm> so I guess that i tell the web dev to fix this
[08:17:41] <Cork> sounds like a good choice
[08:26:38] <rizonz> some people say jqeury is not needed anymore as it was a gapfiller between multiple browsers back the days, I doubt this, so what is true ?
[08:27:21] <Cork> rizonz: depends on what you mean by needed
[08:27:48] <Cork> it never was a must, but it is still providing convenient dom tranversal functions
[08:28:08] <Cork> and it does still have a few compatibility workarounds for browser bugs
[08:28:38] <rizonz> so it will live ?
[08:28:48] <Cork> (but as for the compatibility aspect, no not as needed as before, but jquery3 is a lot smaller for this exact reason too)
[08:28:54] <rizonz> I mean, I hate to hop around from language to language and like a layer between which is maintained well
[08:28:55] <Cork> why would it not?
[08:29:03] <Cork> jquery isn't a language
[08:29:08] <rizonz> Cork: dunno, that is why I ask
[08:29:10] <Cork> its a framework of functions
[08:29:16] <rizonz> yeah true, sorry
[08:29:20] <Cork> it is all just pure js
[08:29:50] <rizonz> you it' not odd to use it in the future ?
[08:30:09] <Cork> its development pace isn't decreasing if that is what you're worried about :)
[08:30:33] <Cork> not anymore then it was 5 years ago
[08:30:50] <rizonz> I mean, when I compare JS/Jquery to Angular then I' crying because of the angular interpretation
[08:31:00] <Cork> for small scripts that doesn't do much, i would most likely not use it
[08:31:55] <Cork> the web today is a bit too much about running after the new fancy
[08:32:12] <Cork> sure run if you like, but jquery is not going anywhere :)
[08:32:30] <rizonz> okay
[09:20:11] <MikeD_> "the web today is a bit too much about running after the new fancy"  Cork++
[09:52:55] <Reza> hi guys
[09:53:12] <Reza> how can i use jquery in qt liberary ?
[09:54:09] <poboy> when I click on each arrow, I want to copy just the info from the field right above it and place it in the same field under the "Current" column.  https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/1/
[09:54:44] <poboy> will someone help.
[09:58:21] <poboy> aguz: are you able to help?  https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/1/
[09:59:43] <Cork> poboy: just ask and wait, don't pester ppl, you will get the answer when someone has the time/sees the question
[10:02:29] <Cork> hmm the div table structure doesn't make this easy...
[10:02:42] <Cork> (as you don't have any relation to work with cause of it)
[10:03:57] <poboy> Cork:  In order to display 2 columns with arrow buttons in the middle that's what I had to do to make it work.  If there is a better way I'm happy to change it
[10:04:27] <Cork> poboy: the problem is that you have no structured relations for the rows
[10:04:38] <Cork> its just a block soup
[10:05:05] <Cork> if the button had been in the same div as the field or something like that it would make for a much more robust solution
[10:05:37] <Cork> (also you shouldn't use event attributes, use event listeners instead)
[10:06:55] <poboy> cork: you mean the "onclick"?
[10:06:59] <Cork> yes
[10:07:13] <Cork> anyway i'm working on the fiddle
[10:07:30] <poboy> thank you
[10:10:51] <Cork> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/4/
[10:11:05] <Cork> i would strongly recommend creating a cleaner dom structure
[10:11:38] <Cork> but that should work somewhat as long as the dom doesn't change (as the structure is so fragile)
[10:12:00] <poboy> Cork: thanks so much.   I'm just not sure how to make the dom structure cleaner
[10:20:16] <Cork> poboy: incomplete, but something like this https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/5/
[10:23:33] <poboy> Cork: thanks again for spending time on this.  I appreciate the help
[10:24:03] <Cork> np

[12:07:20] <Anticom> Hi all. Can i somehow listen on property changes using jQuery? I'd like to disable my validator when an input element is disabled
[12:07:41] <taplar> you don't
[12:08:06] <taplar> jQuery doesn't do mutation observers
[12:08:17] <Anticom> taplar: but i need a way to do that :/
[12:08:30] <Anticom> is there a #vanillyJS way of doing this?
[12:08:33] <taplar> do you control the code that changes the property?
[12:08:49] <Anticom> taplar: yes but it's hard to obtain a reference to my validator
[12:08:51] <taplar> ##javascript would be where to ask for a vanilla way
[12:09:13] <Anticom> I've abstracted everything away by writing a jq plugin arround my validation lib
[12:09:15] <taplar> but the easiest way would be to simply execute your code in the block that performs the property modificaiton
[12:09:34] <Anticom> hm okay so back to the drawing board :/
[12:10:13] <taplar> if you want to get a little uncoupled you could create your own event
[12:10:38] <taplar> if the block that changes the prop you could do something like
[12:10:50] <Anticom> it's been years since i've last written a jq plugin. The one i wrote today is really crap but it does the job for now ;)
[12:11:04] <Anticom> i think i should just get comfy with writing them again so i get the API i actually want and need
[12:11:06] <taplar> $theElement.prop('whatever', 'whateverNew');  $theElement.trigger('myCustomEvent')
[12:11:19] <taplar> then other code could listen for the 'myCustomEvent' on elements
[12:11:35] <Anticom> that idea acutally isn't that bad
[12:11:36] <Anticom> cheers
[13:16:49] <poboy> crapnuggets.  "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined"
[13:17:01] <poboy> replace works on the fiddle Cork shared.  https://jsfiddle.net/70z8keem/4/

[14:25:04] <velix> When using Post with "contentType : 'application/json'", PHP doesn't recognize it. Is it better to drop the content type or use php://input ?
[14:25:42] <taplar> i assume you are trying to give only json to the service?
[14:26:33] <taplar> if so you'd need to pull the content body and parse it yourself if you are not using a framework that does it automatically for you
[14:27:04] <taplar> though this is more of a ##php question
[14:27:59] <velix> taplar: exactly. thanks for your ide (btw: I'M not using a framework).
[14:28:22] <taplar> i think i have an example of this some where...
[14:28:27] <velix> taplar: I thought, this problem might be common, since PHP and jQuery are often used togther.
[14:28:41] <taplar> it's really indepentend of jquery
[14:28:42] <velix> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2845459/jquery-how-to-make-post-use-contenttype-application-json
[14:28:45] <velix> let's give it a try ;)
[14:28:50] <taplar> any request that sends json to your backend would do it too
[14:29:52] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/taplar-hiddenworld/blob/master/private/restFramework.php
[14:29:58] <taplar> look at the loadRawInput method
[14:30:17] <velix> taplar: see my question ;) 'php://input' :)
[14:30:29] <velix> taplar: thanks for your input.
[14:30:29] <taplar> loadTheRawInput that is.  You can disregard a lot of my made up framework logic there
[14:30:44] <velix> taplar: you've really helped me a lot (no joke). thanks
[14:31:21] <velix> taplar: no joke, that pretty equal to what I did.
[14:31:30] <taplar> sweet
[14:32:01] <velix> taplar: I'm just suprised, why it works without contentType ;)
[14:32:13] <taplar> cause all contentType does is sets the header
[14:32:20] <taplar> Content-Type: application/json
[14:32:24] <taplar> on the request
[14:32:33] <taplar> whither you listen for that or not, doesn't really matter
[14:32:37] <velix> taplar: yeah, but it's still a $_POST request
[14:32:42] <taplar> doesn't matter
[14:32:45] <velix> I see.
[14:33:01] <taplar> all a post request means is that the query params are in the content body, not the params list
[14:33:05] <velix> I thought, content-type just gives a nice information about what is being transmitted.
[14:33:16] <taplar> it is
[14:33:16] <velix> taplar: oooh you're right
[14:33:27] <taplar> which frameworks will usually check and auto do stuff for you based off of it
[14:33:46] <velix> Sorry for being a noob ;)
[14:33:49] <taplar> nah
[14:36:18] <velix> Up to now, I've never used jQuery before... it makes some things easier, but it's hard to get into it.
[14:36:56] <taplar> it's all about solving the problem you have at hand.  just going out and trying to learn to learn can be hard
[14:37:13] <velix> The good thing is, there are thousands of examples on the web :)
[14:37:17] <taplar> yup
[14:43:07] <aguz> how can i select a text inside a p or h, .select() only works on inputs...
[14:43:28] <taplar> you don't 'select' by text
[14:43:36] <taplar> you can find the parent and then get the next
[14:43:44] <taplar> *text
[14:44:13] <taplar> otherwise slap a span around it or something that you can find
[14:45:11] <taplar> or this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5441680/css-selector-based-on-element-text#5441763
[14:46:23] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/ more directly
[14:47:01] <aguz> ty
[14:47:37] <aguz> i was trying to do $('span#container').children()[0].select()
[14:47:59] <taplar> you should avoid 'span#container'
[14:48:10] <taplar> '#container' is more efficient and results in the same thing
[14:48:43] <obert_> css!
[14:48:45] <taplar> $('#container').children().get(0).text()
[14:50:08] <aguz> thing is i want to select a piece of text just like you do using a double click
[14:50:59] <taplar> maybe you can do that?  not sure.  i know you can set selection indexes in a textarea, but I don't know if you can in non-textarea/input fields.
[14:51:07] <taplar> probably ask ##javascript about that
[14:52:48] <aguz> ok, thx
[15:35:05] <taplar> oooooh suzanna, don't you cry for me
[15:35:33] <taplar> no one's named suzanna anymore..... tear

[23:29:59] <raul782> Hi guys, I have a loadData function that is executed inside a complete handler from an ajax call. The thing is under $.getJSON success function, I replace the options of a select.
[23:30:16] <raul782> and then I call $select.change()
[23:30:59] <raul782> however this $select has a change event attached with the same loadData function
[23:31:42] <raul782> the thing is that whenever I get the ajax call, a div showing extra info based on the $select value, should be cleared
[23:31:49] <raul782> but it's not
[23:32:00] <raul782> I see loadData is being called twice
[23:32:06] <raul782> and in the correct order
[23:33:02] <raul782> but in the UI, the div is not cleared when the ajax call brings a completely different set of options
[23:33:31] <raul782> I see it's cleared and then re-appeared with the info that was previously selected
[23:33:50] <raul782> how can i deal with that?
