[00:01:06] <_TWG_> Evidently not
[01:11:28] <viewty> Morning all. If my jsonp looks like this: http://pastebin.com/mF7LJuN8 how do I format the $.ajax query to get it? I keep getting left-hand assignment errors :/
[02:00:39] <Cork> viewty: are you telling $.ajax to use the hardcoded function name?
[02:01:58] <viewty> No, it doesn't seem to matter - the query generated by $.ajax works if I copy it straight into the browser.
[02:02:42] <viewty> https://jsfiddle.net/ftLssyos/ - getting Invalid left-hand side in assignment, nope
[02:03:36] <WhirledPress> didn't load jquery viewty
[02:03:39] <viewty> The url it gives getData.jsonp?callback=jQuery112xxx......(lots of numbers)   - if I copy that and visit url in browser, it shows me all the data (preceded by the jquery112...string)
[02:04:21] <Cork> viewty: that won't work cause jquery will call a jquery<number> function
[02:04:26] <viewty> I have <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.1.12.0.min.js"></script> before this.
[02:04:34] <Cork> not your parseData function
[02:05:23] <viewty> Chrome console shows the function it creates as a link - if I go to it I see the data: http://pastebin.com/fRYgAQFa
[02:05:38] <Cork> viewty: try adding ?callback=parseData to your url
[02:06:09] <viewty> Same error.
[02:06:12] <Cork> or change the server script to use the callback function name jquery sends
[02:06:18] <viewty> Now the link shows http://172.16.198.19/getData.jsonp?callback=parseData&callback=jQuery1120003508714920634626_1465970754101&_=1465970754102
[02:06:31] <Cork> (you see the problem there... ?)
[02:06:34] <viewty> Which again if I click I see the data
[02:06:45] <Cork> seeing the script doesn't matter
[02:06:46] <viewty> Yes but it works if I visit the link? That's why I'm confused -.-
[02:06:54] <Cork> unless jquery calls the function it won't work
[02:07:04] <Cork> or rather unless jquery defines the function
[02:08:26] <Cork> viewty: try https://jsfiddle.net/ftLssyos/1/
[02:09:11] <viewty> uncaught reference error: parseData is not defined
[02:09:59] <Cork> man i haven't used jsonp hacks much so a bit out of my confordzone
[02:10:04] <viewty> If I do https://jsfiddle.net/z0z61uma/ it works :o
[02:10:24] <viewty> sorry this: https://jsfiddle.net/z0z61uma/1/
[02:10:34] <Cork> ya, that is what jquery will do when it is configured correctly
[02:10:53] <viewty> That suggests that it doesn't care what the callback is called
[02:11:12] <viewty> I can change dosomething to anything and it still works if I change the url in the <script>
[02:11:15] <Cork> it does
[02:11:30] <Cork> viewty: the script you call calls a function
[02:11:30] <viewty> So there's something either being added or missing from the $.ajax query but I can't work out what :o
[02:11:40] <Cork> jquery have to define this function, else it can't catch the data
[02:11:47] <viewty> Yes
[02:12:37] <viewty> I thought that's what the $.ajax function is doing - give it a url, tell it it's jsonp, success: function(data){ // do stuff, sorted. But, either uncaught reference or left side argument error :/
[02:14:08] <Cork> viewty: well you give it a script with a function call that jquery doesn't know what it is
[02:14:15] <Cork> the problem is you have to tell jquery so it knows
[02:14:41] <viewty> Any idea how to do that? :/
[02:15:24] <Cork> viewty: try jsonCallback: 'parseData', in the ajax call
[02:15:33] <Cork> (instead of json: 'parseData')
[02:16:35] <viewty> Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[02:16:41] <Cork> hmm
[02:16:44] <Cork> weird
[02:16:49] <Cork> that should work...
[02:18:14] <viewty> That's what I expected.
[02:18:28] <viewty> And I'm completely stuck on what the problem is lol :(
[02:18:50] <Cork> well the previous ones was broken
[02:18:59] <Cork> but the jsonpCallback should solve that
[02:19:04] <Cork> one min let me make a test
[02:20:29] <Cork> viewty: this works just fine https://jsfiddle.net/mawybpLv/1/
[02:20:50] <Cork> parseData({"text": "some text", "par1": "another text", "_": "1465971601895"}); <-- response
[02:24:18] <viewty> I get left-hand side assignment error again! :((
[02:24:24] <Cork> O_o
[02:24:28] <Cork> in the fiddle?
[02:24:42] <Cork> cause that fiddle works fine here
[02:24:42] <viewty> https://jsfiddle.net/94ax9c61/1/
[02:24:56] <viewty> Oh oops, one sec
[02:26:46] <viewty> I have this: https://jsfiddle.net/94ax9c61/2/
[02:27:07] <viewty> getData.jsonp?callback=parseData&text=some+text&par1=another+text&_=1465971990338:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment
[02:27:11] <Cork> again
[02:27:16] <viewty> Indeed :/
[02:27:17] <Cork> is the fiddle working for you?
[02:27:27] <Cork> you haven't answered the question...
[02:27:37] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/mawybpLv/1/ <--
[02:28:16] <viewty> Sorry didn't realise you wanted me to run it. Yes it does
[02:28:50] <viewty> I get 3 err_blocked_by_client failed to load resources, then [object Object], then the Object "1465972084558"
[02:29:37] <Cork> the first lines is by your adblocker
[02:29:55] <Cork> what content type do you server send for jsonp ?
[02:30:21] <viewty> I have no idea
[02:31:06] <viewty> All they said is: "there is the http://<IPAddress>/getData.jsonp page which does require a callback argument, but would allow you to access the data based on the restrictions here."
[02:32:22] <Cork> opps, i didn't realize the server was accessable...
[02:32:28] <Cork> ok this makes things a lot simpler...
[02:33:43] <viewty> What do you mean by accessible?
[02:33:54] <Cork> that i can actually access it
[02:34:06] <viewty> It's a little room monitoring box. I own it but it's closed source.
[02:34:19] <viewty> And it has no documentation on this unfortunately :(
[02:34:45] <viewty> Umm yeah I can make it accessible from outside if that will help
[02:35:03] <viewty> I think
[02:35:14] <Cork> well it means i can check what it returns and adopt the script for it instead of having you look it up
[02:36:45] <Cork> (i for some reason expected it to be on a private ip...)
[02:37:21] <viewty> It is
[02:37:38] <viewty> But I can get a public ip for it temporarily.
[02:37:47] <Cork> ... 172 is private...
[02:37:59] <Cork> na, don't bother
[02:38:22] <Cork> anyway http://jsfiddle.net/ftLssyos/2/ should work, i can't see any reason why it shouldn'
[02:38:26] <Cork> +t
[02:39:11] <jak2000> hi all
[02:39:48] <viewty> Invalid left-hand side in argument again :/
[02:41:16] <Cork> sounds like the js isn't valid for some reason, not sure why though
[02:41:42] <jak2000> anyone worked with:
[02:41:42] <jak2000> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[02:42:08] <Cork> jak2000: ask the question, not for someone
[02:42:19] <jak2000> ok
[02:44:54] <viewty> Cork: the errors in firefox might be more useful: Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Not enough arguments"  nsresult: "0x80570001 (NS_ERROR_XPC_NOT_ENOUGH_ARGS)"  location: "JS frame :: http://dashboard.loc/lib/jquery-1.12.0.min.js :: anonymous :: line 2"  data: no]

[02:45:44] <Cork> no not really
[02:46:14] <Cork> the only thing i can take it as is that your editor might be adding weird characters in the file
[02:50:15] <viewty> Using sublime text but can try something else to be sure
[02:50:49] <Cork> viewty: it might be from copying from another source
[02:51:41] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10877506  <--- 2 questions, i use .when .... its correct?  2) how to display in line: 44: alert('Listo Orden de Instalacion Grabada con Numero:'+json.idMaster);   (retreive the value of: json.idMaster in line: 20), thanks
[02:52:40] <viewty> no difference with textmate or textedit
[02:52:51] <viewty> This is so bizarre.
[02:54:22] <Cork> jak2000: it should work just the way you have it
[02:54:49] <Cork> ah
[02:55:12] <Cork> jak2000: $.when won't wait for the nested ajax call inside the done function from the first ajax call
[02:55:23] <Cork> as it doesn't know about them at all
[02:55:55] <jak2000> ok i want display the last alert when finish the for /loop  wich is the way?
[02:56:47] <Cork> jak2000: https://jsfiddle.net/bw5cLk13/
[02:58:35] <jak2000> testing
[02:58:36] <jak2000> thanks
[03:03:13] <jak2000> worked :)
[03:03:14] <jak2000> thanks
[03:05:50] <jak2000> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/bw5cLk13/1/  check please lines: 38,39,40,41   how to after the alert (line 38) execute a servlet  in a blank page, and then reload the actual webPage, i am ok? or need other when?
[03:06:46] <Cork> jak2000: line 40 won't block, but if that's ok then ya
[03:08:17] <jak2000> ok, then not need other when, right?
[03:08:30] <viewty> Well color me stuck, I'm out of ideas on hat to try now. Thanks for the help though Cork, appreciate it and your time.
[03:08:37] <Cork> jak2000: why do you think you need it?
[03:09:02] <hellyeah> keydown or keypress events for textarea?
[03:09:16] <Cork> hellyeah: input
[03:09:37] <hellyeah> what is the event for textarea
[03:09:45] <Cork> input
[03:09:47] <hellyeah> is it input?
[03:09:49] <hellyeah> humm
[03:09:57] <Cork> as in user input
[03:10:00] <Cork> not as in the tag name
[03:10:43] <jak2000> i am think that line 40 was ignored and reloaded the page.
[03:10:45] <jak2000> anyway i test
[03:14:43] <Cork> jak2000: as window.open creates a new tab/window no that shouldn't happen
[03:14:54] <Cork> also $.when doesn't work with window.open
[03:18:13] <jak2000> ok
[03:18:15] <jak2000> thanks
[03:18:32] <jak2000> cork wich others TIPS need learn? i am need learn?
[03:18:55] <Cork> that question is a tiny bit broad :D
[03:19:04] <Cork> could you specify it a bit?
[03:22:32] <jak2000> advice me about: (Pls) 1) i need validate my forms.... how to do easy and professional, 2) need use a captcha plugin, a professional captcha 3) need start using payments via web i want start with paypal,  thanks
[03:24:26] <Cork> jak2000: 1) you might want to check on jquery.validation, 2) not much to say here check googles captcha solution i guess, 3) ok? what is the question?
[03:37:51] <jak2000> Cork ok, thanks 3) a secure way to follow, but i google it, thanks
[03:55:37] <viewty> Cork: pm'd you the ip if you get a chance to test, no problem if you're busy with other stuff now..
[03:56:07] <Cork> viewty: i normally block pms so you need to say first
[03:56:16] <viewty> Oh ok.
[03:56:16] <Cork> (try again)
[03:57:05] <Cork> ah
[03:57:15] <Cork> it has a broken content-type that might be the problem
[03:57:29] <Cork> (it sends application/json though it should be text/javascript)
[03:57:43] <viewty> Oh how did you see that?
[03:57:51] <Cork> the browsers network tab
[03:58:09] <Cork> (the servers response headers)
[04:00:43] <viewty> Right ok
[04:00:49] <viewty> Can that be worked around?
[04:02:44] <Cork> AH not i see the problem
[04:02:57] <Cork> the server puts the timestamp argument in the function name
[04:03:09] <Cork> parseData&_=1465977736127 <--
[04:03:19] <Cork> not really a valid function name :)
[04:04:59] <Cork> viewty: http://jsfiddle.net/ftLssyos/3/
[04:05:08] <Cork> that one works
[04:06:36] <jak2000> how to setup a input readonly with jquery?
[04:06:39] <viewty> I can't see the difference? :o
[04:06:48] <Cork> viewty: the cache: true
[04:06:59] <Cork> it means jquery won't add the _= param
[04:07:37] <viewty> Oh I see :o
[04:08:11] <Cork> the correct fix is that the server should parse params correctly
[04:08:14] <Cork> but... what ever
[04:08:18] <viewty> I overlooked that because the default for cache is false
[04:09:38] <Cork> viewty: this is prob a better solution http://jsfiddle.net/ftLssyos/4/
[04:09:54] <Cork> it prevents jquery from sending the callbacks param, so it defaults to "parseData"
[04:10:06] <Cork> so the server doesn't fail at the _= line
[04:10:14] <Cork> and you still get the cache avoidance feature
[04:10:44] <viewty> Ah yes. Very clever
[04:10:53] <viewty> Cork: you are a hero, thank you so much.
[04:11:01] <Cork> np, interesting problem :)
[04:11:14] <Cork> (and a VERY broken server)
[04:11:30] <viewty> Do you have a tipjar?
[04:11:41] <Cork> nope
[04:12:03] <viewty> Yes, unfortunately they aren't very helpful as they want you to use their silly website to see the data the box pushes too. I wanted it on my tv ^ :o
[04:12:14] * AdamPDotty sings We need another hero
[04:12:30] <viewty> Well thank you again, much appreciated.
[04:19:02] <jak2000> i ave this: $("#xFecha").datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy/mm/dd'});   and display a calendar....
[04:19:10] <jak2000> how to remove this assignment?
[04:23:35] <AdamPDotty> There is .datepicker("disable"); and .datepicker("destroy");
[04:26:10] <jak2000> ok thanks
[04:55:44] <andywww> hi, i’m struggling with a conceot a bit here
[04:55:50] <andywww> i’m trying to write a module that does its own ajax calls asyncronously
[04:56:00] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/1d95532aec2411bd72e7a5a5917f70b5
[04:56:29] <Cork> andywww: you can't return the data if you use async
[04:56:32] <Cork> you need to use callbacks
[04:58:15] <andywww> so send the fetchTweetsFor(“manager”, “buzzword”, callbackFunction);
[04:58:15] <andywww> ?
[04:58:45] <andywww> with the callback function containing the shizz to apply it to the dom?
[04:58:51] <Lachezar> Hey all. Is this a proper/acceptable place to ask for problems with jQuery plugins like Select2?
[04:58:51] <Cork> andywww: or you can do fetchTweetsFor("manager", "buzzword").done(function(tweet) {})
[05:01:32] <andywww> ooh
[05:01:35] <andywww> i’ve not seen taht
[05:01:39] <andywww> is that a promise?
[05:02:00] <Cork> yes
[05:02:12] <andywww> ace, thanks for that
[05:02:20] <andywww> i didn’t realise they were that easy to implement
[05:04:02] <Cork> andywww: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[05:04:10] <Cork> if you want both done and fail
[05:04:22] <Cork> or just $.Callbacks() if you only want one for the data
[05:04:34] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Callbacks/
[05:04:41] <Cork> it's really simple
[05:06:36] <andywww> yeah my understanding of callbacks is a bit better
[05:06:45] <andywww> its just promises i’ve not dabbled with
[05:06:47] <andywww> i’ll have a read
[05:06:48] <andywww> thanks
[05:10:54] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9531ff2c98173f5685aa212b02170337
[05:11:01] <andywww> so its as simple as that then, really?
[05:11:27] <Cork> no
[05:11:35] <andywww> ah shit
[05:11:38] <Cork> the function need to return a $.Deferred()
[05:11:41] <andywww> what did i do wrong?
[05:11:42] <Cork> but it isn't much harder
[05:12:02] <Cork> var cb = $.Deferred(); return cb;
[05:12:15] <Cork> and then cb.fireWith(result);
[05:12:37] <Cork> andywww: btw if you want you can use the promise from $.ajax
[05:12:53] <Cork> .then lets you modify the return value from the call
[05:13:19] <andywww> so what would that look like in that code?
[05:15:01] <Cork> $.ajax().then(function(data) { return modifyContent(data.list); }).done(function(list) {});
[05:15:10] <Cork> semi psudo code, but i hope you get the idea
[05:16:58] <andywww> yeah i think so i’m gonna have a play
[05:16:59] <andywww> cheers
[05:24:18] <Lachezar> I've an issue with Select2 with multi-selects with Placeholders: they keep resizing: http://jsbin.com/dajafeceza/edit?html,output
[05:25:05] <Lachezar> Please advise. The page has three multi-selects on a row, one row with placeholders, other without. Selecting value in selects with place holders makes them resize
[05:25:35] <Cork> Lachezar: don't use jsbin if you want help
[05:25:47] <Cork> the service sucks unless you just want to use it in one browser
[05:25:52] <Cork> as it loses the changes all the time
[05:26:03] <Cork> (the link is empty)
[05:26:19] <Lachezar> Cork: I tried fiddle, but was unable to run the Select2.
[05:26:34] <Cork> well i'm unable to see your code so...
[05:26:36] <Lachezar> Cork: http://jsbin.com/cumugahoka/1/edit?html,output
[05:26:47] <Cork> still empty
[05:27:03] <andywww> nope, no i don’t, i thought i had it then
[05:27:05] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/823c850dd12d5fa530cc87b9de0c82d7
[05:27:29] <andywww> where does deferred get brought into that ajax call or its return value?
[05:27:31] <Lachezar> Cork: weird. I can see both even with a new profile :-/
[05:27:42] <Cork> you need to call the deferred if you want it to fire the callbacks :)
[05:28:09] <Cork> andywww: but like i said there are cleaner ways you can do it
[05:28:37] <andywww> *scratching head*
[05:28:48] <andywww> need to RTFM a bit more
[05:30:41] <Cork> andywww: https://jsfiddle.net/5bd7k7Lt/
[05:31:15] <Cork> opps the declaration doesn't aline
[05:31:16] <Cork> one min
[05:32:16] <Cork> andywww: https://jsfiddle.net/5bd7k7Lt/1/
[05:32:17] <Cork> ther
[05:32:19] <Cork> +e
[05:32:36] <andywww> sweet, thanks
[05:32:49] <andywww> i’ll use that for now and delve a bit more later
[05:32:51] <andywww> cheers for that
[05:33:13] <Cork> andywww: and when we're at it
[05:33:17] <Cork> lets remove the xss :)
[05:33:45] <andywww> ??
[05:34:08] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5bd7k7Lt/2/
[05:34:10] <andywww> so .then is essentially the same as complete:
[05:34:10] <andywww> ?
[05:34:28] <Cork> concuting random external data into a string and injecting it in to the dom as html
[05:34:34] <andywww> ah yeah i see what you mean, thanks
[05:34:39] <Cork> means they can send <script> tags and execute what ever they like
[05:35:00] <Cork> opps
[05:35:07] <Cork> function(i, tweet) => function(tweet)
[05:35:17] <Cork> $.map doesn't have the same argument order as each
[05:35:27] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/5bd7k7Lt/3/
[05:52:11] <matthewbe> hi
[05:52:50] <matthewbe> how do I get the elements of class "select", but only checkboxes
[05:53:06] <matthewbe> $('.select') to get the elements of class "select"
[05:53:14] <matthewbe> but then I don't know how to filter for checkboxes
[05:55:00] <Cork> matthewbe: $('.select[type="checkbox"]')
[05:55:13] <Cork> or $('.select:checkbox') if you prefer a helper
[05:55:17] <Cork> (does the same thing)
[05:56:22] <matthewbe> Cork, ah thank you, and should I use the event "change" or "click" for listening to checkbox change of state?
[05:56:31] <Cork> change
[05:56:39] <matthewbe> Cork, ok, it seems click works too
[05:56:40] <Cork> though you might want to bind keydown too
[05:57:12] <Cork> .on('keydown', function() { setTimeout(function() { $(this).trigger('change'); }); });
[05:57:34] <Cork> so that if you change the select by keyboard it still triggers the event
[05:57:51] <Cork> (depending on what you plan to do with the event that is)
[05:58:28] <konrados> Cork - why the "setTimeout"?
[05:58:51] <Cork> else the event doesn't trigger correctly
[05:59:16] <Cork> it's just to make the browser spin the event loop
[05:59:28] <Cork> as it doesn't have any time, it runs as soon as possible
[06:00:41] <konrados> before returning from  'keydown' event, right? But so what?
[06:01:20] <Cork> konrados: if you fire the change event while the keydown event is still progressing, the event doesn't work correctly
[06:01:58] <konrados> ok, thanks!

[07:13:31] <Prabhat> I am working on a project in which i have to generate image from a modified image.I have image on webpage and the image have different labels on it that are filled dynamically by a text from textbox.Now ,I want to generate preview image from the background image and lable's text.How can i do it?Or is there any other method to do the same thing?
[07:14:38] <Prabhat> Please help me

[07:28:40] <moldy> hi
[07:29:00] <moldy> in a click handler for an <option>value</option> element, how do i get at the value?
[07:29:29] <Cork> moldy: option isn't a real element, so you can't bind handlers on them
[07:29:43] <Woet> I know I've done this before, but I'm hitting a blank. if I use .append, is it possible to get a selector that only works on the appended HTML?
[07:30:02] <Cork> no
[07:30:02] <Woet> e.g. $("#id").append('<span class="foo">hi</span>'); and then use $(".foo") that will only match the appended .foo
[07:30:04] <moldy> Cork: oh? it seems to work
[07:30:19] <Woet> Cork: was that for me?
[07:30:21] <Cork> Woet: do var newElement = $(); .append(newElement)
[07:30:24] <hellyeah> hey
[07:30:27] <Prabhat> I am working on a project in which i have to generate image from a modified image.I have image on webpage and the image have different labels on it that are filled dynamically by a text from textbox.Now ,I want to generate preview image from the background image and lable's text.How can i do it?Or is there any other method to do the same thing?
[07:30:28] <Woet> Cork: alright, nice, thanks.
[07:30:51] <hellyeah> is there a some function in jquery for calculating the time difference between first event and second event?
[07:31:11] <Cork> moldy: it works in some browsers, but it isn't spec complient, or cross browser
[07:31:39] <Cork> hellyeah: var org = new Date(); org - (new Date())
[07:31:45] <Cork> opps
[07:31:49] <Cork> hellyeah: var org = new Date(); (new Date()) - org
[07:31:54] <moldy> Cork: oh. thank you for pointing that out. what should i do instead? also, in which way exactly is <option> not a real element?
[07:31:57] <joaocastanho> Hello. I want to submit a form via ajax and then displaying results. This is a get/search form. I have pagination so people would need to interact with the page which would in this case, reload it, which would loose all the information that was passed through ajax. How do I do this?
[07:32:15] <hellyeah> i am stupid
[07:32:16] <hellyeah> :D
[07:32:21] <Cork> moldy: select is a replaced element, option is used by the browser to populate what ever it uses to create the replaced element
[07:32:30] <Cork> moldy: so none of the normal js or css rules apply
[07:32:43] <Cork> moldy: the solution is to bind change on the select element and check its value
[07:33:08] <moldy> Cork: thanks, i will try that
[07:34:13] <WebDevB> Hey anyone around
[07:35:05] <WebDevB> I'm trying to post data that has multiple checkboxes with the same name... the trouble is when i run print_r($_POST['colour']); it just returns the first bit of data
[07:35:38] <Cork> WebDevB: you need to suflix the name with []
[07:35:55] <Cork> and php will parse it as an array automatically

[07:38:52] <Woet> obviously I'm doing something wrong, but what is it? https://jsfiddle.net/s70ksnwp/1/
[07:39:10] <Woet> the "hi a hi" should turn into "hi moo hi" with the .text selector

[08:53:43] <Duikb00t> o/
[08:53:52] <Duikb00t> someone able to help me with this it's not that difficult:
[08:54:11] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/ppejuqfm/2/  This is the script I have
[08:54:28] <Duikb00t> I only want to show 1 'form' when I click 1 of both buttons they should never appears both under the divs
[08:54:48] <Duikb00t> you can click 'afspraak' or 'reserveren' but only the last item clicked should be shown
[08:57:26] <Cork> Duikb00t: just hide both before you show the one you want to show
[08:59:51] <Duikb00t> before both click handles or in them?
[09:00:56] <Cork> before you show the target
[09:01:51] <Duikb00t> https://jsfiddle.net/ppejuqfm/3/ this works
[09:02:05] <Duikb00t> Looks like it could be refactored in a better way but ok.. it's working
[09:11:36] <Duikb00t> Cork:  Awesome: https://jsfiddle.net/ppejuqfm/4/
[09:20:19] <taplar> why is type scoped higher?
[09:21:28] <Duikb00t> you have a point.
[09:22:06] <Duikb00t> But in the rules of  DRY https://jsfiddle.net/ppejuqfm/6/
[09:22:18] <Duikb00t> it feels like im writing twice the same code -_-'
[09:22:41] <taplar> the two methods are very close
[09:22:46] <Cork> Duikb00t: you have, you can base it on the dom structure and have one event handler for all of it
[09:22:52] <taplar> you could possibly combine them if you used some data elements
[09:22:55] <Cork> but you have to move away from ids to do that
[09:23:33] <Cork> (but i don't have the strength to do that battle right now)
[09:26:00] <Duikb00t> ok :D
[09:26:03] <Duikb00t> Makes sense.
[09:26:22] <Duikb00t> Maybe stupid question but 'how cross browser are data- attributes? '
[09:26:30] <Cork> completely
[09:26:36] <Cork> its just a spec change
[09:27:00] <Cork> the point of data- is that the spec guarantees to never use any attribute starting with data-
[09:27:19] <Duikb00t> Oh awesome :)
[09:27:30] <Cork> there are some extra dom accessors you can use to access them
[09:27:37] <Cork> but you don't need to use those
[09:27:46] <Cork> (and if you don't they are just normal attributes)
[09:38:14] <hellyeah> taplar:
[09:38:17] <hellyeah> hey sup
[09:38:25] <taplar> hey
[09:39:21] <hellyeah> i will calculate the time difference between two events and will do ajax call with setTimeout how does it sound? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/hLuds5h7/
[09:39:53] <docmur> I have some code: https://jsfiddle.net/qs8qt6nv/  How do I pick up the active text of the select box being changed? Right now if I change the top box, I stil lget Text 1
[09:40:15] <Cork> hellyeah: uh, the timeout is meant to do what?
[09:40:44] <hellyeah> setTimeout for doing next ajax call.
[09:41:04] <Cork> and what do you need the date for in this situation?
[09:41:45] <hellyeah> well i can type quiet characters in text box. I dont want to do ajax request immediately i want to give them some time to type more characters
[09:41:47] <Cork> docmur: $(this).val()
[09:42:06] <Cork> hellyeah: then you don't need date
[09:42:35] <Cork> hellyeah: what you should do is start a setTimeout on input, give it a delay (how long you want to wait for no input)
[09:42:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:42:42] <hellyeah> what do i need
[09:42:46] <Cork> hellyeah: and store the reference id
[09:42:49] <hellyeah> i am open minded for suggestions
[09:42:57] <Cork> on a new input call clearTimeout(id)
[09:43:04] <Cork> that's it
[09:43:18] <hellyeah> i want to set delay with some flexibility
[09:43:27] <hellyeah> according to how fast user type
[09:44:08] <docmur> Where do I put that?
[09:44:27] <Cork> hellyeah: have you tried a solution like this? https://jsfiddle.net/hLuds5h7/1/
[09:44:31] <Cork> it should be enough
[09:44:40] <Cork> adjusting for type speed is normally not worth it
[09:45:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:45:15] <hellyeah> let me check why not worth it can you explain?
[09:45:27] <Cork> if you want to filter user typing one character a min, just filter on $(this).val().length > 3 or something
[09:45:41] <hellyeah> i am kinda new i just try to learn stuff thanks for support
[09:45:43] <Cork> hellyeah: cause the server load shouldn't matter in those cases
[09:46:28] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:46:48] <hellyeah> but there can be many erequests
[09:46:52] <hellyeah> request*
[09:46:54] <hellyeah> ic
[09:47:03] <Cork> hellyeah: no there shouldn't really be
[09:47:16] <Cork> if the timer fires again you should abort the old ajax call
[09:47:18] <hellyeah> i think the logic is this time approximation will be less then server load i is it correct?
[09:47:34] <hellyeah> coffetti:  ic
[09:47:36] <hellyeah> ops
[09:47:38] <hellyeah> Cork:  ic
[09:47:42] <Cork> hellyeah: no, it is that what you're doing is premature optimizations
[09:47:46] <hellyeah> new ajax call aborth pervious one
[09:47:55] <Cork> make a simple easy solution and see if it is enough
[09:47:56] <hellyeah> and set timeout value to 500 again
[09:48:05] <Cork> make it complicated if it becomes a problem
[09:48:11] <hellyeah> cork i understand
[09:48:29] <hellyeah> ic first easy solution then compllicated solution
[09:48:41] <Cork> if needed ya
[09:48:49] <Cork> normally it isn't
[09:49:22] <Cork> and in those situations caching is prob a better solution
[09:50:06] <codecutter> i'm modifying dom just after calling window.opener.location.reload() but refresh seems to take slightly longer, which undoes dom modification.How would you guys do it?
[09:50:31] <Cork> docmur: well as you didn't share any code where you want to access it
[09:50:54] <hellyeah> caching can you explain how is it related?
[09:50:56] <Cork> codecutter: you can't ever solve that situation
[09:51:22] <Cork> codecutter: js is syncron and there are no callback for reload
[09:51:58] <Cork> hellyeah: for example store the result from the earlier search, and then make a local filtering in that search result
[09:52:11] <Cork> expecting that the new search of the original result
[09:52:15] <Cork> (as an example)
[09:52:53] <Cork> what caching to use depends on the situation
[09:53:58] <codecutter> okok, nvm
[09:54:13] <codecutter> ok*
[09:55:56] <hellyeah> Cork:  i think google does this
[09:56:16] <hellyeah> Cork:  when you type a word it will complete most searched term
[09:56:27] <hellyeah> with most searched terms
[09:56:39] <hellyeah> this is what you meant right
[09:57:15] * hellyeah hoping to make sense
[10:11:20] <docmur> Sorry I thought I did, Thisd is the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/qs8qt6nv/
[10:11:53] <CaptainMoronic> This is going to be a very vague question but does anyone know why my map tiles on my google map aren't loading? http://gustav.be/rembrandt/contact
[11:05:43] <moldy> plain javascript still doesn't have string interpolation, right?
[11:07:02] <mmmveggies> define "plain"
[11:07:24] <mmmveggies> ES2015 is slowly being adopted by browsers, all evergreen browsers have it
[11:07:37] <mmmveggies> some mobile and IE vShit doesn't
[11:23:26] <docmur_> Hey guys I was here a hour ago but had to go to work, my problem is I want to figure out how to grab the text which is showing in the select box,heres my code: https://jsfiddle.net/Lpbzp9hL/  Right now I'm always getting the first index returned
[11:28:40] <mmmveggies> docmur_:  https://jsfiddle.net/Lpbzp9hL/1/
[11:30:08] <docmur_> Cool, never seen that approach
[11:41:48] <RattyWork> What is the best way to apply a method to elements added on and after page load? For example, I would like to add a simple color picker automatically to fields that are added to the DOM. Right now I can do on(‘click’, ….), but that of course only does it after the element is clicked. Are there any other ways to handle this?
[11:43:07] <docmur_> I actually just figured it out before you posted that, this was my solution to it: https://jsfiddle.net/Lpbzp9hL/
[11:45:49] <RattyWork> docmur_: It doesn’t seem to be doing anything, is that the correct fiddle?
[11:48:39] <cydrobolt> hey
[11:48:55] <cydrobolt> for some reason, $(elem).css('background', hex); is only working once
[11:49:07] <cydrobolt> if I manually change the background color through the console, the function will work once
[11:49:09] <cydrobolt> then it stops working
[11:49:11] <cydrobolt> any ideas?
[11:53:53] <cydrobolt> nvm
[11:54:32] <docmur_> Try this: https://jsfiddle.net/Lpbzp9hL/
[11:57:30] <RattyWork> docmur_: That is the same link....
[11:59:33] <docmur_> It loads at my side :S
[11:59:53] <docmur_> https://jsfiddle.net/v1h429xp/1/
[12:01:31] <taplar> i don't see any jquery in that fiddle
[12:02:08] <taplar> sorry, was looking at the other

[12:20:22] <xenaxon> hi all !!
[12:20:28] <xenaxon> need some help !
[12:21:02] <xenaxon> $( "#comps.comp_checkbox_row").last().remove();
[12:21:21] <xenaxon> I have this line, how can I make it do this only if there are at least 2 elements
[12:21:38] <xenaxon> I don't want it to remove the last one, want to have at least one.
[12:21:50] <xenaxon> but if say there are 5 elements, I want it to be able to remove up to 1
[12:23:16] <shoky> .slice(1).last().remove()
[12:23:48] <shoky> or.. use an `if` ?
[12:25:22] <shoky> er though that selector will only ever find one element..
[12:27:21] <xenaxon> what does slice do
[12:27:36] <xenaxon> I used an if
[12:27:39] <xenaxon> fixed it
[12:27:44] <xenaxon> but was thinking of a way to do it inline
[12:28:14] <shoky> http://api.jquery.com/slice/
[12:29:47] <xenaxon> shoky: how can I select the children of a selected element by index
[12:30:07] <xenaxon> let's say I do: $("#theParent").child(1)
[12:30:09] <xenaxon> let's say I do: $("#theParent").child(2)
[12:30:12] <xenaxon> etc
[12:30:21] <taplar> children().eq(#)
[12:30:22] <shoky> .children().eq(0)
[12:30:29] <shoky> :@
[12:30:32] <taplar> :)
[12:34:34] <taplar> i guess if you wanted to inline it you could do $whatever.not($whatever.first()).last().remove()
[12:35:18] <taplar> but yeah, slice is cleaner
[12:36:00] * taplar is half asleep today
[12:39:38] * shoky is always half asleep
[12:41:08] <taplar> i started trying a new game last night and was checking my phone like, i got a few more hours.  turn around and it's 11, -_-
[12:41:36] <shoky> good game?
[12:42:02] <taplar> it seems pretty fun.  still getting used to it and the public area layout
[12:42:25] <taplar> its kinda funny since i've never been a FPS person, but i seem to be getting into them more now
[12:45:01] <abc__> how do I grab multiple results in a return from json
[12:45:12] <taplar> hmm?
[12:45:21] <abc__> I have a loop in my php file with multiple results
[12:46:01] <taplar> easiest way would be to push them all to an array and echo that encoded at the end
[12:46:36] <abc__> Okay, right now I push it after the loop
[12:46:52] <taplar> so you are already doing that?
[12:46:54] <abc__> but it shouldn't be inside too right?
[12:47:22] <abc__> $jsonArray = array('result' => $result);
[12:47:31] <abc__> but I do it outside loop
[12:47:32] <taplar> whatever your doing, your end result should be a single json object, which can contain many json objects, but you want just the one top level
[12:47:50] <abc__> okay, so what should I do?
[12:48:36] <taplar> i'm assuming your loop is going over your results, right?
[12:48:50] <abc__> yes, a while loop that goes through my results
[12:49:04] <taplar> ok, so before the loop create an empty array
[12:49:11] <abc__> sure
[12:49:12] <taplar> then in the loop array_push to it
[12:49:22] <taplar> then after echo json_encode that array
[12:50:08] <taplar> and then your ajax will get that array.  it won't be named (unless you give it a name) and will be an array.  if you name it, it will be an object (in javascript)
[12:57:15] <abc__> taplar: thanks a lot man. It really worked like that :P I just wasnt thinking about the array :P
[12:57:23] <taplar> cool
[12:57:50] <taplar> yeah you could do it with returning all of them individually but you'd have to do some trickery when it came time to parse it javascript side i believe
[12:57:56] <taplar> just easier to make it a single dude
[13:00:06] <taplar> "single dudes are better" - Taplar 2016
[13:00:56] <_TWG_away> Can anyone help me.  https://jsfiddle.net/pbhzr6aj/6/ .  I'm adding a class to the parent div just fine when the user clicks in the field and I can remove it whenever they click out.  However I need the class to be changed to input-filled when it has content and when the page loads if a field is preloaded I need the input-filled added to the parent
[13:00:56] <_TWG_away>  div.
[13:04:50] <taplar> you got three classes in there, 'someclass', 'input-focus', and 'input-filled'.  when should each of them be present?
[13:06:24] <shoky> sry taplar, had to afk. what game was that?
[13:06:37] <taplar> Destiny
[13:08:06] <shoky> ah online-only
[13:08:12] <taplar> sadly yeah
[13:08:56] <shoky> i remember my gaming buddy looking forward to this one
[13:16:22] <abc__> taplar: another question that maybe you can give me some ideas
[13:18:02] <abc__> taplar So I grab those results and return them. I do have some pagination too. I want to be able to go through all pages without refreshing, etc
[13:20:16] <taplar> what part is your q?
[13:20:31] <abc__> pagination part
[13:20:45] <abc__> I did the pagination, but I want to be able to change page now
[13:21:11] <taplar> did you use a plugin for the paging or write your own?
[13:21:20] <abc__> I did it myself
[13:21:36] <taplar> and how many records are we talking about?
[13:21:46] <abc__> there's 14 records
[13:21:49] <abc__> 10 per page
[13:22:41] <taplar> ok, so since you did it yourself, your going to have to keep an internal variable of the response, and you'll refer to that when the users try to page to get your next/previous results
[13:23:09] <abc__> ah
[13:23:27] <abc__> so it should be when the form is submitted
[13:23:45] <abc__> and what do you mean by internal?
[13:23:46] <taplar> typically something like that would be an event on some elements
[13:23:55] <taplar> like a next/previous button or something
[13:24:11] <taplar> internal would just be a javascript variable, so your not making that ajax call over and over
[13:24:24] <taplar> since your already returning them all, and there are not that many of them
[13:24:40] <abc__> I see, but in my php file I do limit them
[13:24:49] <abc__> so it doesnt return all of them
[13:24:52] <taplar> ah
[13:24:56] <taplar> in that case scrap that
[13:25:18] <abc__> how?
[13:25:19] <z1haze_work> is there anyway that I can just listen for a response without binding to the submitting form/element? I have an iframe in my page that a user uploads files to, I need to be able to listen for the response from that form in the iframe to determine whether the user can continue and submit our form
[13:25:48] <taplar> what you can do then and setup your next/previous buttons (or whatever) to give the endpoint some identifier for it to use in the query
[13:25:56] <z1haze_work> I tried using like $('#iframe').load(function() { ... then $('#iframe').contents() but that breaks my page, im probably guessing our platform doesnt allow that usage
[13:26:45] <abc__> right, so I would just store form values in a variable from last ajax call and then use it when I'm doing pagination call?
[13:26:49] <abc__> something like that?
[13:27:21] <taplar> abc__: something like //mydomain/myendpoint?action=next&id=something
[13:27:22] <z1haze_work> Or can I do a delegated listener binding to an <iframe> ?
[13:27:47] <taplar> action 'next' or 'prev' could tell it which way you want to look for things
[13:27:59] <taplar> and then the id you can use in the query, based on the action, to know how to compare
[13:28:46] <taplar> depending on if your going backwards or forwards, the id would be either for the first or last result currently displayed on the page
[13:28:57] <abc__> taplar I get it. Right now I'm using ?page= ... I was looking for a way to get the previous inserted values in the form so I can do an ajax call again with those values
[13:29:34] <taplar> the thing with using 'page' is it can be tricky, if your backend data is changing often
[13:29:36] <abc__> Am I thinking correctly?
[13:29:57] <taplar> if your data is changing, then what a page once was, may not be valid anymore
[13:30:01] <taplar> part of it may be on another page now
[13:30:13] <taplar> which is why i lean towards giving an id of some kind and direction
[13:30:17] <abc__> I see your point
[13:30:53] <abc__> Well, dont worry, I'll think about it though. But what about my idea to store last inserted values in the form. Is it okay?
[13:31:17] <taplar> sure, you can use data fields for that stuff
[13:31:30] <taplar> if your not already using that info else where in the form
[13:31:56] <abc__> where would I use data-attribute?
[13:32:28] <taplar> you can use data attributes any where.  consider something like the following for illustration
[13:32:56] <jose3_> Why wouldn't this work for me?   $('.btn-text').addClass('btn-disabled') through the chrome console? I have it setup on a success action, and it does work sometimes though so I know the class itself is valid
[13:33:37] <taplar> <tr data-user-id="1234576098736"><td class="firstName">Joe</td><td class="lastName">Brown</td></tr>
[13:34:40] <taplar> if i wanted to page backwards, i could grab the first tr and get that data-user-id and give it to my backend to look for users with a user id less than that
[13:35:37] <taplar> jose3_: have you tried console.log( $('.btn-text').length ) ?
[13:36:18] <abc__> hey taplar sorry. My internet is having bad times
[13:36:28] <taplar> what did you see last?
[13:36:39] <jose3_> that says 1
[13:37:04] <taplar> jose3_: then that function should work fine
[13:37:04] <z1haze_work> http://dpaste.com/2311MED the first alert fires, but the second one does not, any ideas how I can do this??
[13:37:50] <taplar> z1haze_work: any errors?
[13:38:18] <z1haze_work> nope
[13:38:50] <z1haze_work> it just totally ignores anything targetted in the iframe
[13:39:06] <taplar> the iframe is for the same domain?
[13:39:18] <z1haze_work> there is 1 error, well its a security error it says
[13:39:22] <z1haze_work> and no, different domain
[13:39:26] <taplar> can't do that
[13:39:29] <z1haze_work> its some stupid box uploader thing
[13:39:29] <taplar> CORS
[13:39:34] <z1haze_work> shit
[13:39:39] <z1haze_work> any way around?
[13:39:43] <taplar> nope
[13:40:12] <z1haze_work> well referring to my initial scenario, i need to listen for a response from submitting this iframe form, so i can enable the parent form to be submitted on my page
[13:40:17] <z1haze_work> im sol?
[13:41:10] <z1haze_work> i mean the response comes back in the console what cant i just bind to the submission of that form
[13:41:13] <taplar> does it fire that load event after you submit the iframe?
[13:41:38] <z1haze_work> the #boxiframe.load() ?
[13:41:41] <taplar> yep
[13:41:53] <z1haze_work> it fires on page load, no it doesnt fire after you submit the form in the iframe
[13:42:03] <z1haze_work> i am seeing the 'loaded' alert
[13:42:11] <z1haze_work> am not seeing the 'hi' alert
[13:42:22] <taplar> but you are seeing the loaded alert after submit?
[13:42:28] <abc__> taplar Now I think it seems okay
[13:42:34] <z1haze_work> not submit, no
[13:42:40] <abc__> so where should I use it?
[13:42:52] <z1haze_work> I am loading the page with this iframe taplar
[13:43:28] <taplar> right, which would load the iframe.  my question was if the changing of the iframe would cause the load to fire.  not the hi part, but the outer part
[13:43:49] <taplar> i would have thought i would have but *shrug*
[13:43:52] <z1haze_work> ill submit the form in the iframe and see
[13:43:56] <z1haze_work> i dont think so though
[13:44:17] <z1haze_work> no, it does not.
[13:44:21] <taplar> booo
[13:44:22] <z1haze_work> only fires once on page load
[13:44:26] <taplar> yeah, not sure how you'd do that then
[13:44:38] <z1haze_work> would a delegated even listener work
[13:44:43] <taplar> do you have any control over the iframe page?
[13:44:45] <z1haze_work> nope
[13:45:04] <z1haze_work> its a real shitshow actually
[13:45:07] <taplar> afaik, you sol dude
[13:45:19] <z1haze_work> alright
[13:45:34] <z1haze_work> I just dont see how CORS comes into play when im just listening for an event in the iframe
[13:45:43] <taplar> cause it's not your website
[13:45:55] <z1haze_work> but how am i getting the response in my console
[13:46:01] <taplar> it's security to keep people from doing crap without people knowing they are
[13:46:12] <taplar> that's not javascript, that's your browser loading the console
[13:46:15] <taplar> err, iframe
[13:46:16] <z1haze_work> oh i see
[13:46:25] <z1haze_work> so preventing phishing stuff
[13:46:41] <taplar> hidden iframe, directed at gmail, delete all emails.  yay!
[13:46:41] <z1haze_work> makes sense i suppose
[13:48:49] <z1haze_work> well this whole setup is stupid then
[13:48:50] <taplar> abc__: what was the last message of mine you saw?
[13:48:50] <z1haze_work> lol
[13:49:01] <z1haze_work> people gonna be spamming this form, and i dont even care
[13:49:24] <taplar> only other thing you might could do that i just remembered people talking about, is you could proxy to that form
[13:50:08] <taplar> you could make your own page which you put in your iframe, which would would have access to, which when you submit it would just proxy the request to the real page in the backend
[13:50:33] <z1haze_work> thats beyond me
[13:50:55] <shoky> or you could find a service with a simple documented API you can use, instead of trying to hack one into an iframe ;p
[13:50:58] <z1haze_work> this was above and beyond for the scope of this project anyway, they didnt want to pay for anything worthwhile, so this is what they get
[13:51:31] <z1haze_work> well our platform is demandware, so its literally only ecommerce, we have no access to database stuff, making new tables, submitting new forms, etc
[13:51:35] <z1haze_work> kinda stupid
[13:55:43] <taplar> i've been hearing that term more and more lately
[14:09:11] <notchris> I'm doing the following to replace an item
[14:09:12] <notchris> viewModel.edits.splice(index, 1, newItem);
[14:09:21] <notchris> How would I add an item?
[14:09:51] <taplar> add where?
[14:10:01] <notchris> to viewModel.edits
[14:10:17] <taplar> beginning, end, ...
[14:10:24] <notchris> https://i.imgur.com/1HuKWbC.png
[14:10:29] <notchris> That is the function to rename the edit
[14:10:35] <notchris> I'm trying to duplicate it
[14:10:54] <notchris> I think I need to edit the .splice line
[14:11:37] <taplar> so you want to add an item at the index?
[14:12:15] <notchris> Yes
[14:12:43] <notchris> Well it's index, because the function occurs when the rename button on a list item is clicked
[14:12:49] <notchris> So index is referencing the current list item
[14:12:59] <notchris> And the splice is replace it with the same item, but a new name
[14:13:05] <notchris> I want to instead duplicate it with the new name
[14:13:58] <taplar> give ##javascript a shot.  i'm not familiar with a single operator to do that
[14:15:55] <taplar> wait, splice adds or removes
[14:17:03] <taplar> so splice(start, newItem) would add the item at start
[14:17:08] <taplar> according to the docs
[14:17:24] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[14:19:07] <GeekMonkey> http://jplist.com/ has anyone used this before?
[14:19:59] <jquery739> i have # in my url
[14:20:08] <jquery739> and that is breaking other things
[14:20:15] <jquery739> how cn i fix it?
[14:20:17] <jquery739> please help
[14:21:17] <taplar> jquery739: that's a very vague question
[14:21:32] <sillyslux> move cursor to # and press del
[14:21:39] <Uhkis> try unbreaking it :-)
[14:25:19] <sillyslux> ok here a lucky guess, jquery739 try e.preventDefault()
[14:27:01] <jquery739> this line has the error
[14:27:03] <jquery739> hash=window.location.hash.match(/\#\!\/([^.?]*)\??/)[1]
[14:27:56] <taplar> wth...
[14:28:03] <jquery739> this is the console error
[14:28:04] <jquery739> sr.min.js:5 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '1' of null
[14:28:52] <taplar> "An Array containing the entire match result and any parentheses-captured matched results, or null if there were no matches."
[14:29:23] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match
[14:33:38] <sillyslux> jquery739, the error is that you try to get the 2nd value that match returns, but null has no 2nd value
[14:34:04] <jquery739> oh thank you
[14:34:24] <taplar> i thought i said that, :P
[14:34:33] <sillyslux> say history.pushState(null,null,"gage#!/hage") in jsconsole
[14:34:36] <jquery739> yes , you too said that
[14:34:41] <sillyslux> then window.location.hash.match(/\#\!\/([^.?]*)\??/)[1]
[14:34:44] <Uhkis> you bot just repeated what thte console said very clearly!
[14:34:48] <sillyslux> it'll return "hage"
[14:34:48] <Uhkis> both*
[14:35:04] <Uhkis> the*
[14:35:11] <Uhkis> wtf was in my beer :D
[14:35:59] <sillyslux> Uhkis, what else should i have said?
[14:36:01] <taplar> what does the hash look like, and what part are you trying to get?
[14:37:04] <Uhkis> sillyslux: maybe a poem? :-)
[14:37:38] <sillyslux> if you can't read it try to eat it?
[14:37:53] <Uhkis> exactly!
[14:37:59] <Uhkis> delicious letters
[14:38:03] * AwkwardCough claps
[14:38:08] <sillyslux> all that matters
[14:38:10] <taplar> the console say, invalid o.b.j. i am confused within my skull.
[14:38:22] <sillyslux> for i am dull
[14:38:26] <taplar> i asked the room, to which they presume.  i must be returning null
[14:38:29] <sillyslux> the console say..
[14:39:01] <Uhkis> 2016-06-16 - the day i made #jquery type poems
[14:39:14] <taplar> that taplar fox, he said check the docs.  for they are all knowing
[14:39:32] <sillyslux> shall i be showing?
[14:39:36] * taplar quits
[14:39:54] * sillyslux show's his ...
[14:40:29] <sillyslux> her! her's ...
[14:41:23] <jquery739> i have this string in my url
[14:41:25] <jquery739> some-string-1#product-review
[14:41:47] <sillyslux> oh let's stop j...ing i should be working
[14:41:53] <jquery739> it has # , then why   window.location.hash.match(/\#\!\/([^.?]*)\??/)[1] returns null
[14:42:33] <sillyslux> your regex expects something that has #!/... in it
[14:42:36] <taplar> so your trying to get 'product-review', ignoring the leading # and any ?stuff=blah that might follow?
[14:42:51] <jquery739> yes
[14:44:52] <sillyslux> window.location.hash.slice(1) would remove the leading #
[14:45:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/utuo26qu/
[14:48:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/utuo26qu/1/
[14:49:06] <taplar> i prefer the non-regex way
[15:00:27] <jquery739> whats the best way to understand each code of a min.js file ?
[15:01:19] <taplar> find the non-min file
[15:01:49] <jquery739> how to find non min file?
[15:02:21] <taplar> whatever your using should have came from a repo or a website.  they usually provide both min and non-min files.  look for their site
[15:02:42] <jquery739> oh ok
[15:02:44] <jquery739> got it
[15:02:46] <jquery739> thank u
[15:04:35] <sillyslux> in chrome if you look at the source file in developer-tools there is a button labled {} if you click it it'll beautify the minified code
[15:04:52] <sillyslux> *alternative
[15:06:59] <notchris> How do I get key?
[15:06:59] <notchris> https://i.imgur.com/amrEEQL.png
[15:07:07] <notchris> localStorage.getItem('metadata-mbr0qmb').key ?
[15:07:22] <taplar> you have to parse it
[15:07:35] <taplar> values in localStorage and sessionStorage are strings
[15:08:00] <sillyslux> so you can even set breakpoints on minified code
[15:09:36] <taplar> i guess you can do that depending on how it was minified
[15:10:20] <notchris> taplar: https://i.imgur.com/TMxBIXN.png
[15:10:22] <notchris> Like that?
[15:11:13] <taplar> does it work? :D
[15:11:28] <notchris> metadata-jv8khvh:"[object Object]"
[15:11:30] <notchris> weird
[15:11:45] <taplar> you should stringify it before you put it back in
[15:11:46] <notchris> Do I need to use stringify?
[15:11:48] <notchris> ahh
[15:11:49] <notchris> OK
[15:13:54] <notchris> taplar: So I also need to add that rnd value to an object
[15:14:00] <notchris> edits:"["la86nuq","mbr0qmb"]"
[15:14:18] <notchris> How do I go about adding that to the object
[15:14:26] <notchris> So it would be
[15:14:32] <notchris> edits:"["la86nuq","mbr0qmb","newvalue"]"
[15:14:51] <taplar> so edits is an array you would push to
[15:15:52] <notchris> Exactly
[15:16:00] <notchris> edits.push
[15:16:00] <notchris> ?
[15:16:05] <taplar> yup
[15:16:28] <notchris> edits.push(rnd)
[15:16:36] <notchris> But I need to parse it first, right?
[15:16:38] <notchris> yeahh
[15:31:07] <jose3_> Hey ... is this a normal thing to do? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bafc696840b72bd40d32eccbe9122e6f I feel like this is a bad practice?
[15:40:05] <geri> hi, where can i find the images linked within this css file? http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.11.4/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css
[15:46:27] <sillyslux> http://jqueryui.com/resources/download/jquery-ui-themes-1.12.0-rc.2.zip
[15:46:57] <sillyslux> http://jqueryui.com/download/
[15:48:43] <NaN> hi there
[15:49:10] <NaN> if I have an script that writes to $ ($.foo) is it better to make it a plugin? what are the consecuences if not?
[16:02:21] <MikeD_> how do i make jsfiddle include jqueryui ?
[16:02:38] <sillyslux> add external resources
[16:06:41] <taplar> or select 2.1.4
[16:12:06] <MikeD_> mouse event seems to work on .position() "of" property...  do you know if there's a way to make it work on a key event?
[16:15:33] <sillyslux> taplar, indeed, and lot's of options on jquery(edge)
[16:29:42] <BetaFrey> I have a web application that is using jquery, and I noticed that there are multiple versions being referenced, i'm also getting a TypeError: ScriptResource.axd?d=WTV37…:182 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'orientation' of undefined, Is there a way for me to determine which versions of jquery are actually being used by code or narrow down
[16:29:42] <BetaFrey> what's throwing this?
[16:32:58] <BetaFrey> for example, is there a way for me to determine which of these have dependencies / dependents  and which can be removed? jquery/1.10.2.jquery.min.js, jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.min.js ,jquery-1.9.1.js, ajax/jquery-2.1.0.min.js, vendor/jquery.js
[16:34:27] <Uhkis> BetaFrey: depending on the vendor ones versionm 1.10.2 is a safe bet for all
[16:34:36] <xenaxon> hi
[16:34:40] <xenaxon> is anybody good with mustache?
[16:34:50] <Uhkis> only when shaving
[16:35:18] <xenaxon> I have an array of objects inside of an object, and want to display a checkbox for each of those objects
[16:35:45] <xenaxon> but I can't figure out how to use mustache in this case
[16:35:49] <BetaFrey> Thanks Uhkis,
[16:37:08] <BetaFrey> the vendor ones appear to be 2.1.4 and 1.3.2 Uhkis
[16:37:24] <Uhkis> ouch
[16:37:56] <Uhkis> 1.3.2 is really old and if something's depending on it, it probably breaks
[16:39:24] <BetaFrey> So worst case I should be able to remove all but 1.10.2 and 1.3.2 and then maybe have to get some noconflict thing ? Uhkis I'm mostly just trying to determine where my orientation error is coming from, but I can't find any actual code with that ScriptResource, so I thought my best bet is to start deleting things in case there is some conflict with
[16:39:24] <BetaFrey> the jquery.
[16:39:55] <BetaFrey> since, i'm assuming the master page shouldnt' have that many different jquery versions on it..
[16:40:19] <Uhkis> preferably only one
[16:41:32] <BetaFrey> I wish i knew what the 1.3.2 was being used by :/
[16:49:22] <bonks> Hey is there a way to monitor and trigger an event if an element with a specific class is added to the dom, without explicitly calling trigger()?
[16:50:34] <Uhkis> bonks: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver
[16:52:01] <BetaFrey> Uhkis: do you know of any ways to search if pages are using jquery?
[16:54:31] <Uhkis> BetaFrey: i usually check for $ in console
[16:56:44] <BetaFrey> I believe I was able to remove all of the versions from the master page except 1.10.2 so I wonder where my script resource error is coming from,--- Thought it would be a good idea to check which pages try to use jquery to see if any are dependant on that old version (although I guess every page uses it since the master page uses it..) XP
[17:01:10] <Uhkis> add some console.log to the old one?
[17:03:08] <BetaFrey> I didn't think about that.
[19:53:18] <bonks> Can I use MutationObserver to fire an event when an ajax call appends HTML to the DOM, but only when a child element of the HTML contains a certain class?
[19:53:41] <bonks> I tried using on('DOMNodeInserted') but this seems to only work for the parent element
[20:59:54] <robertparkerx> is it possible to trunicate text inside of a div and also have a button apend after the trunicated text so when that button is clicked it will slide the text back into view
[21:40:05] <subsume> how do I get the updated outerHTML of an element that may have later had its DOM updated
[21:40:32] <subsume> using vanilla outerHTML gives me a vanilla page load version (I am attempting to get the html source of banner ads)
[22:00:25] <subsume> Is there some handy way to convert the result of $(node).contents() into text?
[23:24:51] <jqueryius> hi
[23:24:58] <jqueryius> if i have 6 <li> items
[23:25:03] <jqueryius> and i click the 5th one
[23:25:14] <jqueryius> is there any easy way to change the class on items 1-4
[23:25:26] <jqueryius> and likewise if i clicked the 6th one, have it change items 1-5
[23:25:37] <jqueryius> so basically, do a mass change on everything "above" it in the list
