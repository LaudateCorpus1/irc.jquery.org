[00:45:02] <km4> I have problem :P
[02:06:38] <phpcoder> hello
[02:06:56] <phpcoder> what is the best way to check inner properties like obj.one.two.three
[02:07:03] <phpcoder> without throwing an exception ?
[02:08:05] <Cork> phpcoder: you mean traverse them if they exist and just not crash if they don't?
[02:08:38] <Cork> is one way to do it (((obj||{}).one||{}).two||{}).tree
[02:09:23] <phpcoder> Cork, exactly
[02:09:32] <Cork> if(obj.one !== undefined && obj.one.two !== undefined) { obj.one.two.three } is another
[02:09:43] <phpcoder> :o really ? is there not an elegant solution ?
[02:10:05] <phpcoder> obj.one.two.three does not throw an exception if "two" (for example) does not exist ?
[02:10:14] <Cork> you could add the method to undefined.prototype i guess...
[02:10:21] <Cork> (never tried that)
[02:10:50] <Cork> but ya, you can't try to access members on undefined without exceptions
[02:11:05] <phpcoder> Cork, or data.hasOwnProperty(one) && data.one.hasOwnProperty(two) etc etc
[02:11:08] <Cork> also (||{}) is quite elegant
[02:11:29] <Cork> phpcoder: undefined is enough
[02:11:49] <Cork> checking for hasOwnProperty requires the element to be an object
[02:11:54] <phpcoder> yes but i have to check "undefined" against each property right ?
[02:11:59] <phpcoder> ah ok
[02:12:32] <Cork> well this is actually what i recommend: ((obj.one||{}).two||{}).tree
[02:12:49] <Cork> it is the cleanest solution
[02:12:59] <phpcoder> Cork, seems unredable
[02:13:02] <phpcoder> btw
[02:13:04] <phpcoder> ok i will use that
[02:13:06] <phpcoder> thanks!
[02:13:28] <Cork> phpcoder: (obj.one||{}) means use one if it isn't undefined else use {}
[02:13:45] <Cork> the next step uses .two unless it is undefined else {}
[02:13:54] <Cork> and lastly it uses .three
[02:14:10] <Cork> phpcoder: you could write a small function to hide the logic if you prefer that
[02:14:23] <phpcoder> yeah sounds better
[02:14:52] <Cork> function c(obj) { return obj||{}; } c(c(obj.one).two).three
[02:15:53] <phpcoder> thanks Cork
[02:18:52] <dimi1947> I want to take advantage of event bubbling...so when a click event reaches an element to trigger a jquery method...this method has to do with an element being hidden(it is for emptying an ID=''))...it has no effect though,,,can the reason be that the element is hidden
[02:19:33] <Cork> dimi1947: you can't click on a hidden element
[02:19:51] <dimi1947> give me a minute cork I want to try something
[02:21:39] <dimi1947> problem solved...
[02:58:35] <nettoweb> hello guys
[03:25:48] <relix> hey guys, I have the weirdest bug in my code, jquery doesn't apply any css to one specific DOM element
[03:26:15] <relix> example code: $($0).hide()
[03:26:44] <relix> doesn't work, on this specific element only - there's no `display: none` being added, in fact no css I try to add using jquery is added
[03:27:16] <relix> what could have happened to cause this?
[03:27:40] <relix> some starting points to look for would be great
[03:31:47] <guessx> relix, instead of using a var to grab document class/id have you tried it without, just incase its not scoping it correctly?
[03:32:15] <relix> guessx I'll try right now - $0 is what google chrome calls the selected element in the console, and it worked with the other DOM elements I selected
[03:32:56] <relix> yeah it does nothing
[03:33:01] <Uhkis> relix: check css files for !importants
[03:33:04] <relix> the element is found using the selector
[03:33:23] <relix> Uhkis does jquery check for that?
[03:34:32] <Uhkis> jquery doesn't, you should check
[03:35:12] <relix> Uhkis but jquery doesn't add the style anyway
[03:35:21] <relix> I can inspect the element, it has no style=""
[03:35:30] <Uhkis> oh
[03:35:44] <relix> it's a form, maybe that's a reason?
[03:35:53] <relix> if I change the tag it works again
[03:36:04] <relix> when I change it back it doesn't anymore (chrome console)
[03:36:44] <Uhkis> fiddle would be useful
[03:37:01] <Uhkis> ?demo @ relix
[03:37:01] <b-ot> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:37:12] <relix> yeah I can't, the codebase is too large sorry
[03:37:39] <Uhkis> isolate the problem from the other stuff
[03:39:33] <relix> I've changed the form tag to a div tag - I'm using javascript to extract the values and it doesn't need to be submitted, so it can do without a form tag
[03:39:35] <relix> this makes it work
[03:39:55] <relix> it's an interesting bug and I'd love to have the time to work on it, but unfortunately my client wouldn't like it :)
[03:41:46] <Uhkis> relix: http://jsfiddle.net/334ncpuf/ this does not work in your project?
[03:42:15] <relix> uhkis nope
[03:42:24] <relix> no styling I add got added
[03:42:50] <Uhkis> kinda impossible to debug without seeing it
[03:43:02] <relix> even doing .css("background-color", "red").css("background-color") returned undefined
[03:43:17] <relix> I know, but changing the tag fixed it, so don't worry about it
[03:43:41] <relix> I was just wondering if maybe this was a well known bug that had an answer like "oh yeah that happens frequently when you do <X> so check for that"
[03:43:59] <relix> could even be just a bug in jquery for all I know, we're not using the latest
[03:44:14] <relix> thanks for the help anyway :)
[03:44:56] <JosefDe> Hi guys. I'm binding an event with: jQuery("body").on( "click","[data-type='button']"
[03:45:25] <JosefDe> Why can't I unbind doing this?: jQuery("body").off( "click",".icon-folder");
[03:45:46] <Cork> JosefDe: cause the event is [data-type='button']
[03:45:55] <Cork> there is only one event handler
[03:46:07] <Cork> so you can't exclude some elements though off
[03:46:13] <JosefDe> Cork: And how can I disable click event for that specific button?
[03:46:17] <Cork> you have to check for them and exclude them in the event handler
[03:46:23] <JosefDe> Cork: How?
[03:46:28] <JosefDe> Aha..
[03:46:31] <JosefDe> Cork: Really?
[03:46:34] <JosefDe> Cork: That sound's hacky
[03:46:40] <Cork> if($(this).hasClass('icon-folder')) { return; }
[03:46:48] <Cork> JosefDe: what's hacky about that?
[03:47:06] <Cork> you have one event handler that catches all click events that happens on elements with data-type
[03:47:21] <Cork> JosefDe: an option is to modify the selector in the bind function
[03:47:30] <JosefDe> Cork: The problem is this:
[03:48:04] <Cork> so something like jQuery(document).on('click', '[data-type="button"]:not(.icon-folder)', function(event) {})
[03:48:19] <Cork> but off can't help you
[03:48:39] <JosefDe> Cork: The problem is, that I'm trying to disable the event, after the page has been loaded
[03:48:50] <JosefDe> How shall your last exapmle work?
[03:49:01] <Cork> that would be jQuery("body").off("click", "[data-type='button']")
[03:49:09] <JosefDe> Aha. Let me try that.. Man this is really tricky :)
[03:49:14] <Cork> (though you should bind it on document not "body"
[03:49:16] <Cork> )
[03:49:23] <JosefDe> Why not body?
[03:49:36] <Cork> cause it is pointless to make it use a selector
[03:49:44] <Cork> you already have document as an element instance
[03:50:09] <Cork> if you want to bind it on a closer parent it makes sense
[03:50:17] <Cork> but binding on body doesn't
[03:52:48] <JosefDe> Ok. Let me try that and see if it works
[03:53:40] <JosefDe> Perfect!
[03:53:43] <JosefDe> You're a genius
[03:55:10] <arup_r> How to check if a dropdown is selected or not using Jquery ?
[03:56:20] <arup_r> I meant any value is selected or not .. except the prompt value
[03:56:29] <Cork> arup_r: $('#elm').val() != ""
[03:56:46] <arup_r> ok
[03:59:58] <arup_r> Cork: thanks
[05:29:16] <hellyeah> yo
[05:29:21] <hellyeah> is it wrong usage? https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/5/
[05:30:11] <hellyeah> taplar: can i request a help ? :)
[05:36:04] <xec> hellyeah: what do you think $.getJSON() takes in and returns back?
[05:36:56] <hellyeah> i take json array and return json object
[05:37:01] <hellyeah> is it wrong?
[05:37:05] <hellyeah> i am really newbie
[05:37:14] <xec> yeah, it's an ajax call
[05:37:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:37:29] <xec> to parse JSON you probably want JSON.parse() instead
[05:37:30] <hellyeah> ic
[05:37:48] <hellyeah> i have json array want to make a table
[05:38:48] <hellyeah> xec: https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/12/
[05:39:05] <hellyeah> do i have to wrap this with ajax call?
[05:39:35] <hellyeah> yeah JSON.parse gave me more convenient result
[05:49:00] <hellyeah> hey what is my mistake here?
[05:49:04] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/17/
[05:51:08] <shoky> hellyeah: there's no table in the html. also you're doing this  "<td>" + $parseJSON[i] + "</td>"    but  $parseJSON[i]  is an object, not a string
[05:51:35] <Cork> also you don't want to append to an element in the page in a loop
[05:51:42] <Cork> that will kill performance
[05:51:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:51:49] <hellyeah> a sec
[05:53:19] <hellyeah> Cork: you mean this https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/22/
[05:53:59] <Cork> hellyeah: https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/23/
[05:54:00] <hellyeah> but that does give me every row
[05:54:20] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:54:45] <Cork> or even cleaner https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/24/
[05:56:55] <hellyeah> Cork: this table has urladdress
[05:57:06] <hellyeah> but table may not have url address sometimes
[05:57:13] <hellyeah> is there any generic thing i can use
[06:00:17] <hellyeah> it looks kinda stupid https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/34/
[06:01:04] <Cork> hellyeah: is this somewhat what your looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/v4g8Ljt7/35/
[06:01:37] <hellyeah> yes
[06:05:59] <hellyeah> Cork: thanks
[06:06:27] <hellyeah> column and value is special for json i guess
[06:09:09] <squeakytoy2> Hey all. Quick question. Is there a way to see if there are any "fail" functions attached to a deferred?
[06:09:30] <squeakytoy2> For example, if i implement a .always for a deferred, can I see if any .fails have been invoked?
[06:11:24] <shoky> squeakytoy2: don't think you can see if any fail callbacks have been attached, but you sorta check if they have been invoked via .state()
[06:12:03] <squeakytoy2> .state only reveals if the promise was rejected or resolved, i think, but i can check
[06:12:45] <shoky> yea and if it was rejected then probably the .fails have been invoked
[06:43:55] <jamy-232343> Hey, I'm in need of some help. How would I go about selecting the "direction" object? Here's my JSON: https://gist.github.com/jamieohanlon/edd04069abdbbf4bed3a
[06:44:20] <jamy-232343> I do console.log(data.departures.004.direction) but it doesn't work.
[06:46:48] <shoky> jamy-232343:  data.departures["004"].direction
[06:47:51] <shoky> jamy-232343: actually,  data.departures["004"][0].direction
[06:48:08] <shoky> since the 004 points to an array
[06:48:40] <jamy-232343> With that I'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property '004' of undefined"
[06:49:08] <shoky> jamy-232343: maybe you haven't parsed the json properly. share your code..
[06:49:46] <shoky> (also that snippet you pasted isn't complete)
[06:50:53] <jamy-232343> Never mind, I got it working. Thanks
[06:52:02] <jamy-232343> Do you have any idea how I'd get all "directions" from every object inside departures?
[06:54:37] <Cork> jamy-232343: data.departures[004].direction
[06:54:50] <Cork> you can't start a key with numbers
[06:55:10] <Cork> jamy-232343: opps wrong question >_>
[06:56:13] <Cork> jamy-232343: $.map(data.departures, function(departure) { return Object.values(departure)[0].[0].direction; })
[06:56:17] <Cork> something like that should work
[06:57:18] <shoky> some of his departures have multiple objects tho
[06:58:03] <shoky> jamy-232343: http://jsfiddle.net/yxrj9Ln6/
[06:58:22] <Cork> damn js doesn't have .values :x
[06:58:28] <shoky> yeh that too ;p
[06:58:58] <jamy-232343> thanks guys i'll have a look
[07:27:15] <taplar> anyone know if there's an easy way with dataTables to carry over the data-* elements from the original trs?
[08:12:33] <muks_> Hi
[08:13:21] * muks_ <select id="sort" name="sort" ><option value="relevant">Relevant</option><option value="date">Date</option></select>$('#sort').change(function() {
[08:13:22] * muks_ 	$('form').submit();
[08:13:22] * muks_ });
[08:13:31] <duch_kazatel> hey don't paste code into the channel.
[08:13:37] <duch_kazatel> if you need to show something, make a fiddle :)
[08:13:37] <muks_> any Idea what is wrong in this code
[08:13:49] <muks_> ohh sorry
[08:15:00] <duch_kazatel> :)
[08:17:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6gokrtsn/
[08:17:11] <duch_kazatel> should be fine
[08:18:02] <muks_> http://jsfiddle.net/hwqb3vmd/
[08:18:04] <muks_> thanks
[08:18:05] <muks_> :)
[08:18:24] <muks_> can you please tell what is wrong in this drove me crazy this small piece for last 1 hour not working :(
[08:18:28] <duch_kazatel> works in that fiddle.
[08:18:37] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/hwqb3vmd/1/
[08:18:46] <duch_kazatel> any console errors on your site?
[08:19:20] <muks_> no
[08:19:27] <duch_kazatel> is your js before the form?
[08:19:31] <muks_> no console error it just not submitting
[08:20:02] <muks_> if I put an alert then I get that just form is not sumitting
[08:20:39] <muks_> no I am adding that after form loaded
[08:20:50] <muks_> in the footer it
[08:21:01] <duch_kazatel> and it's the only form on the page?
[08:21:07] <duch_kazatel> something here isn't adding up.
[08:21:16] <muks_> yes only one form
[08:21:27] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see the full page then, because that doesn't make any sense.
[08:33:47] <muks_> http://jsfiddle.net/hwqb3vmd/2/
[08:34:46] <muks_> can you please check first drop drop down next to Positions need to submit the page..
[08:39:14] <duch_kazatel> validate your html - i'll bet you have an issue there.
[08:40:19] <theskillwithin> last time i validated my html was in like 1993
[08:40:23] <theskillwithin> jk
[08:40:51] <theskillwithin> you would put like those LAME tags on ur page,  this is W3C  valid!!! which W3C  is now out of date
[08:41:04] <duch_kazatel> uh
[08:41:08] <duch_kazatel> that's... not entirely accurate.
[08:41:10] <duch_kazatel> but oaky
[08:41:12] <duch_kazatel> *okay
[08:41:40] <duch_kazatel> muks_ yeah something is wrong with your other html. http://jsfiddle.net/hwqb3vmd/4/ this works fine.
[08:42:31] <theskillwithin> best way to handle data-image tag data?
[08:42:58] <duch_kazatel> meaning...?
[08:45:40] <NoiseEee> with care and precision
[08:45:48] <duch_kazatel> lol
[08:45:53] <NoiseEee> :D
[08:48:15] <muks_> duch_kazatel: not able to find.. html validation telling errors like obsolate things
[08:48:39] <muks_> when I am getting alert from the same function then why it is not able to sumbit form..
[08:53:18] <duch_kazatel> your form html is invalid.
[08:53:30] <duch_kazatel> removing everything but the select and the form itself makes it work.
[08:53:31] <duch_kazatel> soooo.
[08:56:02] <JosefDe> Hi guys. When I insert a float-value into a <input> it is like "3,4". How can I put "3.5" into <input> instead?
[08:56:17] <duch_kazatel> use 3.5 instead.
[08:56:23] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you need to use a regex.
[09:00:11] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: I can't use 3.5 because I calculate the value and javascript automatically uses "," instead of "."
[09:00:18] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:01:32] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: Ah ok..
[09:01:48] <JosefDe> duch_kazatel: We have ot blame the templating engine..
[09:08:16] <AbuDhar> you know of any video slider plugin besides rev slider that is free? or just some jquery?
[09:10:03] <Guest8291> dops:did you try to start it with super user permission from terminal?
[09:10:11] <duch_kazatel> wut
[09:11:23] <AbuDhar> duch_kazatel:
[09:11:34] <AbuDhar> I need a video plugin that can have transitions and such
[09:11:36] <AbuDhar> and overlay
[09:11:39] <duch_kazatel> that was meant for Guest1320
[09:11:43] <AbuDhar> oh
[09:11:44] <duch_kazatel> err, Guest8291
[09:11:48] <duch_kazatel> in your case, don't use a carousel.
[09:12:05] <AbuDhar> can I use the <video> element? :D
[09:12:19] <duch_kazatel> i don't understand what you mean but that question.
[09:12:24] <duch_kazatel> yes, there's a video element.
[09:12:39] <AbuDhar> does it work with all files in all browsers?
[09:12:45] <duch_kazatel> uh
[09:12:47] <duch_kazatel> not that simple.
[09:13:03] <AbuDhar> let me show you what I want.. in a PM
[09:13:09] <duch_kazatel> please don't pm me.
[09:13:14] <duch_kazatel> ask in the channel :)
[09:13:49] <AbuDhar> ok sorry lol I wanted to send you an URL
[09:14:11] <AbuDhar> but you saw the video?
[09:14:16] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:14:22] <duch_kazatel> put the URL in here.
[09:14:32] <AbuDhar> www.udvikling2015.dk
[09:14:35] <AbuDhar> what's the difference dude?
[09:15:07] <duch_kazatel> the point of the channel is so everybody can participate.
[09:15:21] <duch_kazatel> PMing me assumes i won't get pulled away, and maybe somebody else will have a better idea.
[09:15:21] <AbuDhar> ok you see the video?
[09:15:33] <duch_kazatel> the background video?
[09:15:36] <AbuDhar> yeah
[09:15:41] <AbuDhar> it's using rev slider
[09:15:55] <duch_kazatel> i don't see a carousel anywhere.
[09:16:02] <AbuDhar> I don't want a carousel
[09:16:14] <AbuDhar> only a video in the background like that
[09:16:19] <duch_kazatel> that's not a slider.
[09:16:28] <AbuDhar> yeah true
[09:16:38] <duch_kazatel> and look at the page source.
[09:16:39] <duch_kazatel> pretty simple.
[09:16:41] <duch_kazatel> video tag.
[09:17:06] <AbuDhar> but how would I make the transitions?
[09:17:13] <AbuDhar> I need to make transitions like on this site
[09:17:17] <duch_kazatel> what transitions are you talking about?
[09:17:21] <AbuDhar> www.fuelsupply.com
[09:17:26] <AbuDhar> check the captions on the video
[09:17:45] <AbuDhar> get it? :)
[09:18:02] <duch_kazatel> javascript, html, and css.
[09:18:05] <duch_kazatel> text overlays the video.
[09:18:20] <AbuDhar> yeah how would I do that in JS?
[09:18:27] <duch_kazatel> which part?
[09:18:29] <AbuDhar> is it hard?
[09:18:32] <AbuDhar> transitions part
[09:18:36] <AbuDhar> when it fades away and that
[09:18:39] <duch_kazatel> it's a series of timeouts to fade things in and out
[09:18:57] <AbuDhar> video elemtent doesn't work in all browsers I think..
[09:19:03] <AbuDhar> it works in IE8?
[09:19:09] <duch_kazatel> search google.
[09:19:14] <duch_kazatel> that page uses the video tag.
[09:19:22] <duch_kazatel> if that's not good enough, find another solution.
[09:19:46] <AbuDhar> I think it will work dude
[09:19:51] <AbuDhar> if I provide the three different formats
[09:20:01] <theskillwithin> if (console) console.log ( $this.data("data-image") );   is returning undefined for me,  even though there is a data-image=""  attribute on the item that was clicked
[09:20:02] <AbuDhar> mp4, ogg and what was the last one?
[09:20:09] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video
[09:20:17] <duch_kazatel> IE 9 and above for most features.
[09:20:28] <duch_kazatel> theskillwithin .data('image')
[09:20:41] <AbuDhar> duch_kazatel: and can I make it work with IE8? :D
[09:20:44] <AbuDhar> with a tweak?
[09:21:03] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6922493/how-to-play-the-html5-video-in-ie8-browsers
[09:21:26] <AbuDhar> thanks for googling for me hahahaa
[09:21:38] <duch_kazatel> give it a shot next time ;)
[09:21:54] <theskillwithin> duch_kazatel hmm still undefined
[09:21:57] <theskillwithin> http://pastie.org/10456604
[09:22:17] <duch_kazatel> i'd need to see the markup, theskillwithin
[09:22:30] <AbuDhar> duch_kazatel: and you think that I could make it better than rev slider right? :d
[09:22:35] <theskillwithin> <img data-image="/I/yhst-139395791561392_2388_72959415" src="/I/yhst-139395791561392_2388_72940356" alt="#">
[09:22:43] <theskillwithin> ooooohhhh
[09:22:45] <theskillwithin> hmm
[09:22:46] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar literally nothing you've shown me uses anything involving a slider.
[09:22:55] <theskillwithin> this is referring to the div that the image is in
[09:22:58] <AbuDhar> yeah but rev slider also supports videos
[09:23:00] <AbuDhar> that's what I meant lol
[09:23:01] <theskillwithin> haha
[09:23:08] <theskillwithin> i think i may have figured it out
[09:23:11] <Kartagis> if you're trying to add a library to crop your image, would id or class matter?
[09:23:20] <AbuDhar> rev slider is the name of a plugin
[09:23:22] <duch_kazatel> AbuDhar but you don't need a slider so i don't understand why you're stuck on it.
[09:23:46] <Kartagis> I'm trying to implement https://github.com/kartagis/cropper
[09:23:51] <duch_kazatel> i gathered as much.  i've given you easily googleable answers for every question you've asked, AbuDhar.
[09:24:13] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis that looks like it supports either selector.
[09:24:21] <duch_kazatel> just need to make sure it's the image.
[09:25:06] <Kartagis> yeah, at the moment I have #outerDiv > #image but it doesn't work
[09:25:21] <Kartagis> I don't think it has to be canvas
[09:25:24] <duch_kazatel> Kartagis uh, why that selector?
[09:25:26] <Kartagis> does it?
[09:25:27] <duch_kazatel> should be just #image
[09:25:31] <Uhkis> #image is enough
[09:25:37] <AbuDhar> take it easy duch_kazatel:D:D:D:D:D
[09:25:44] <AbuDhar> thanks for your time
[09:28:00] <AbuDhar> I really appreciate it!
[09:29:56] <Pazician> Hello all. I've two sections that I want to slide in using animate() and they should slide in only when the link is clicked for the specific section https://jsfiddle.net/j3bntvgL/1/
[09:30:36] <Pazician> But as you can see, I'm probably doing something wrong
[09:31:29] <duch_kazatel> bwuh
[09:31:39] <duch_kazatel> var galleryShow = $(this).find('.menu__container ul li a');
[09:31:44] <duch_kazatel> that's your first problem.
[09:32:21] <duch_kazatel> var gallery = $(this).data('href'); needs to be in the event handler.
[09:33:25] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Could you possibly take your time and maybe show me more specific how it should be done?
[09:33:33] <duch_kazatel> https://jsfiddle.net/j3bntvgL/2/
[09:33:37] <duch_kazatel> you want something like this instead.
[09:33:58] <duch_kazatel> the .show call is obviously not the animate, but you should get the idea.
[09:34:06] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Aaah, got you
[09:34:10] <duch_kazatel> your $(this) calls didn't really make sense otherwise.
[09:34:27] <Pazician> I'll try it out! Yeah, right - I think I got lost or something
[09:34:41] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is usually only used within event handlers or .each() calls or within other jquery methods.
[09:35:37] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Alright, what does the function(e)... mean, since you're not using the e.preventDefault() or something?
[09:37:22] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Also, is there any possiblity to make the galleryShow variable dynamic, like when I click on Gallery then it should show gallery and so on... Without writing the links out, instead using like $this or similiar?
[09:40:55] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Oh, you're robertmaxrees - didn't know that, hehe
[09:40:59] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[09:42:35] <theskillwithin> we need to ID the suspect!
[09:46:36] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Is it possible to get the galleryShow to know which link is clicked?
[09:46:50] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:47:00] <duch_kazatel> i already showed you that part.
[09:47:06] <duch_kazatel> $(this) is the thing that was clicked.
[09:49:50] <Pazician> Isn't saying that the variable $galleryShow which is defined for the .gallery will only work on the gallery link, and not the about-us or the other ones, right?
[09:50:12] <Pazician> Or am I lost again...?
[09:50:16] <duch_kazatel> that is correct.
[09:50:57] <duch_kazatel> if you'd like to capture all menu item clicks, use a delegated listener on your parent nav element.
[09:52:54] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Like this: $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a"... Or am I wrong?
[09:53:15] <duch_kazatel> i don't see that ID in your fiddle.
[09:53:26] <duch_kazatel> but if that's a parent element on the nav, then sure.
[09:53:55] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: I quoted from learn.jquery, just looked up the delegated listener - didn't really know what it was
[09:54:04] <Pazician> Thanks, I'll try it out
[09:55:03] <theskillwithin> $('#pdpimage').attr("src", $this.data("image"));    why no work =\
[09:55:22] <duch_kazatel> need to see the code theskillwithin
[09:55:26] <duch_kazatel> like, your markup and js.
[09:55:36] <Pazician> Nice it worked! One question tho, what's the difference between writing like this: $( "#list a" ).on( "click"... and $( "#list" ).on( "click", "a"...
[09:56:01] <duch_kazatel> Pazician the documentation explains that the first one binds a separate listener to ever a element under #list.
[09:56:07] <Uhkis> latter works for dynamic a's under #list
[09:56:09] <duch_kazatel> the second one binds a single listener to #list
[09:56:22] <duch_kazatel> and leverages the fact that the events bubblke.
[09:56:24] <duch_kazatel> *bubble
[09:57:46] <plamb> gonna give this question another shot: this code essentially runs the ajax then refreshes the homepage immediately after, going back to the main page
[09:57:51] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/cRvQD1Jd
[09:58:02] <plamb> (when enter is press)
[09:58:27] <Pazician> duch_kazatel: Hmm... I've a hard time to understand that one - I'll need to read more about it! Thank you so much for taking your time duch_kazatel, I do really appreciate your time, big time!
[09:58:35] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[09:58:44] <theskillwithin> I  am just trying to change the src of an image
[09:58:55] <duch_kazatel> theskillwithin what about your code doesn't work?
[10:03:49] <theskillwithin> it started worked when I made the source a variable first for some reason
[10:04:02] <duch_kazatel> theskillwithin i'd need to see more about your code.
[10:04:17] <theskillwithin> its working now
[10:04:19] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[10:04:29] <theskillwithin> http://pastie.org/10456678
[10:11:01] <plamb> alright here is my question in full
[10:11:03] <plamb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32912371/search-bar-works-on-click-but-not-on-pressing-enter-weird-route-produced
[10:11:13] <duch_kazatel> why are you calling it like that?
[10:11:25] <duch_kazatel> and where's your html?
[10:11:57] <plamb> one sec
[10:13:27] <plamb> here it is with the html
[10:13:28] <plamb> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32912371/search-bar-works-on-click-but-not-on-pressing-enter-weird-route-produced
[10:14:30] <duch_kazatel> you realize that hitting enter will trigger the default submit action, right?
[10:14:43] <plamb> uhh
[10:14:55] <plamb> i assume hitting enter just runs the function above
[10:14:58] <duch_kazatel> nop.e
[10:15:02] <plamb> :(
[10:15:20] <plamb> i got that code from some other stackoverflow question
[10:15:21] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/kkr3rw2g/1/
[10:15:27] <duch_kazatel> you want something like this.
[10:15:51] <plamb> there clicking or pressing enter would work?
[10:16:09] <duch_kazatel> yes, because you're bound to the submit event.
[10:17:26] <plamb> tryin 'er
[10:17:32] <duch_kazatel> it'll be something like that.
[10:17:37] <duch_kazatel> no guarantees that'll be perfect.
[10:18:09] <plamb> im gonna give <form> #search and bind it to that
[10:18:13] <duch_kazatel> no.
[10:18:18] <duch_kazatel> it needs to be on the form.
[10:18:20] <plamb> o-oh
[10:18:23] <duch_kazatel> not the button.
[10:18:28] <duch_kazatel> the submit even occurs on the form.
[10:18:31] <duch_kazatel> *event
[10:18:38] <plamb> but can i give the form an id and bind this to that id?
[10:18:45] <duch_kazatel> sure
[10:18:45] <plamb> or does it have to be bound to the html <form>
[10:18:46] <plamb> ok
[10:18:58] <duch_kazatel> just so a jquery object that has one or more forms.
[10:19:44] <plamb> lol
[10:19:50] <plamb> so now enter works but clicking doesnt
[10:20:23] <duch_kazatel> input type="submit"
[10:20:26] <duch_kazatel> not button
[10:21:12] <plamb> nice
[10:21:16] <plamb> works
[10:21:35] <plamb> also fixed the issue i was having where it would stop working after one search had been submitted
[10:25:05] <plamb> thanks duch_kazatel
[10:36:03] <muks_> duch_kazatel:
[10:36:28] <muks_> I got the issue there was a submit button above that drop down os it was not working
[10:36:43] <muks_> but why it happening no Idea
[10:36:44] <duch_kazatel> there you go.
[10:36:52] <duch_kazatel> was the markup valid?
[10:36:58] <muks_> yeaa
[10:37:12] <duch_kazatel> funky.
[10:37:20] <muks_> only removing that submit button above that dropdown make it work
[10:37:36] <duch_kazatel> something tells me there was a wonk binding somewhere messing you up.
[10:38:19] <muks_> is there a condition that there can not be a any control after sbmit button
[10:38:42] <muks_> I have to have 2 submit button as per my requirement
[10:39:00] <duch_kazatel> nope, that shouldn't be an issue, but 2 submit buttons is pretty suspect.
[11:00:27] <adv_> got a difficult question. all the page flipping scripts that i find emulate a magazine's page turn. has anyone seen anything that emulate's a notebook's page flip instead?
[11:08:16] <duch_kazatel> adv_ those things always make me sad.
[11:08:30] <adv_> duch_kazatel: why?
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> why are we emulating the medium that the internet actively killed?
[11:09:02] <duch_kazatel> i worked in the newspaper industry too long.
[11:09:44] <adv_> duch_kazatel: it's not dead
[11:09:50] <adv_> at least notebooks are not dead
[11:10:17] <duch_kazatel> heh print media is though ;)
[11:10:31] <duch_kazatel> anyway, i haven't seen anything like that.
[11:10:34] <adv_> and i don't want a flashy bling bling emulation
[11:11:01] <NoiseEee> thats what it will be?
[11:11:19] <adv_> some flipping scripts are well done but they always emulate a premium magazine's page
[11:11:32] <duch_kazatel> "premium magazine"?
[11:11:38] <NoiseEee> like "not hustler"
[11:12:28] <adv_> they certainly don't feel like flipping a moleskine notebook
[11:12:44] <adv_> like "not vanity fair"
[11:14:52] <NoiseEee> i think flipboard open-sourced their stuff
[11:14:59] <NoiseEee> thats the only decent one that comes to mind
[11:15:45] <NoiseEee> oh i guess thats sideways
[11:37:25] <plamb> is there a way to use .text() without grabbing the text of child elements
[11:37:39] <plamb> just the current element
[11:38:31] <decx> either clone and remove all children before you grab text or get the textnode
[11:40:07] <plamb> var str = $( "p:first" ).text();
[11:40:12] <plamb> what is :first doing there
[11:40:16] <plamb> i dont recognize it from CSS
[11:40:39] <plamb> like if i have <p> hi <a> lol</a></p>
[11:40:50] <plamb> how do i grab just the text hi
[11:40:54] <plamb> or just the text lol
[11:41:04] <plamb> .text() grabs hi lol
[11:41:08] <decx> :first is just an expression for .first() which is just eq(0)
[11:58:11] <Sal> hi can someone take a look at this and tell m e why it aint working? http://jsfiddle.net/1z4Lkyvd/
[11:58:49] <Sal> also, can someone turn it into a jquery plugin where i pass the function (myFunc) ?
[11:59:23] <decx> add jquery
[12:00:21] <Sal> fck!
[12:00:25] <Sal> alway the same mistake
[12:00:29] <Sal> damn damn and damn
[12:01:13] <Sal> decx, could you help me convert it to a plugin?
[12:01:23] <Sal> i have no idea how
[12:01:45] <Sal> i would like to call it on elements, maybe like an event
[12:02:13] <Sal> $('#el')on('hold', myFunc);
[12:12:03] <duch_kazatel> wurt
[12:12:06] <duch_kazatel> *wut
[12:12:19] <decx> sure whatevs http://jsfiddle.net/1z4Lkyvd/1/
[12:15:39] <plamb> can someone tell me whats going on here
[12:15:40] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/2ozomqd5/
[12:15:57] <duch_kazatel> no jquery included.
[12:16:10] <plamb> hmm
[12:16:23] <plamb> essentially the same exact code in my project but its not working
[12:16:25] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/xrwhp9zu/
[12:16:30] <duch_kazatel> "essentially" is not "the same"
[12:16:55] <plamb> fine heres the exact code
[12:16:56] <plamb> http://pastebin.com/5N5EDpua
[12:17:32] <plamb> the click action works and replaces the html content
[12:17:37] <plamb> but the save button doesnt appear
[12:18:30] <duch_kazatel> dunno then.
[12:18:35] <plamb> that looks right?
[12:18:52] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/xrwhp9zu/1/
[12:18:53] <duch_kazatel> with all your js
[12:19:00] <duch_kazatel> probably a css or html issue.
[12:19:03] <plamb> weird
[12:19:46] <plamb> i just have .savebtn{display:none} in the css
[12:20:10] <duch_kazatel> cool
[12:20:26] <duch_kazatel> so how can i help if i can't replicate the bug?
[12:20:55] <plamb> so weird
[12:24:25] <plamb> ok its ugly
[12:24:29] <plamb> but i think i've replicated it
[12:24:40] <plamb> one sec
[12:25:13] <plamb> duch_kazatel:
[12:25:14] <plamb> http://jsfiddle.net/xrwhp9zu/4/
[12:25:26] <plamb> scroll down and hit that edit icon next to @person.company
[12:28:11] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:28:18] <duch_kazatel> rendered markup yo.
[12:28:24] <duch_kazatel> js doesn't speak templating.
[12:29:39] <plamb> not sure what you mean
[12:29:46] <plamb> oh
[12:29:48] <plamb> one sec
[12:31:37] <duch_kazatel> the first part of your problem is pretty obvious fwiw.
[12:31:37] <plamb> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/xrwhp9zu/5/
[12:31:41] <plamb> :(
[12:31:45] <duch_kazatel> var dataset = $(this).parent(".datainfo");
[12:31:58] <duch_kazatel> you do a replaceWith against dataset
[12:32:01] <duch_kazatel> which contains those icons.
[12:32:08] <plamb> hmm
[12:32:13] <plamb> oh
[12:32:16] <plamb> damn
[12:32:28] <duch_kazatel> dev tools, yo :)
[12:32:29] <plamb> so if i did an appendTo and just let the inputs be inside the p
[12:32:34] <plamb> it'd work
[12:32:37] <duch_kazatel> iono.
[12:32:41] <duch_kazatel> it'll get you closer at least.
[12:32:47] <plamb> seems like an ugly solution but meh
[12:33:17] <duch_kazatel> what templating engine are you using?
[12:34:01] <plamb> hmm
[12:34:04] <plamb> it still doesnt work
[12:34:08] <plamb> im using Play Framework
[12:34:11] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[12:34:15] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[12:34:23] <duch_kazatel> i thought that looked a little familiar.
[12:34:31] <duch_kazatel> i would just show/hide inputs, instead of this .replace() business.
[12:34:44] <plamb> hmmm
[12:35:01] <plamb> in other words, put the inputs in the html
[12:35:08] <plamb> and do .show() .hide() ?
[12:35:09] <duch_kazatel> yep. then just show/hide things.
[12:35:16] <plamb> so no display:none
[12:35:24] <duch_kazatel> you could use display: none if you wanted.
[12:35:29] <duch_kazatel> addclass and removeclass to toggle that kind of stuff.
[12:35:45] <DragonPunch> I can make stuff show up on hover, but how do I make the same element disappear when I hover off the element.
[12:36:00] <duch_kazatel> DragonPunch mouseenter and mouseleave instead
[12:36:10] <DragonPunch> but i'm using .hover ?? ?
[12:36:16] <DragonPunch> should i not use it anymore?
[12:36:41] <duch_kazatel> you can use the other method signature, which proxies to mouseenter and mouseleave
[12:36:44] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/hover/
[12:36:56] <duch_kazatel> or just explicit mouseenter and mouseleave calls.
[12:38:45] <DragonPunch> duch_kazatel: so how do i handle the mouselave part
[12:38:54] <duch_kazatel> uh
[12:39:02] <duch_kazatel> by using two functions?
[12:39:12] <duch_kazatel> one that does what you want when the mouse enters, and the other when the mouse leaves...
[12:39:21] <duch_kazatel> (not sure what you're confused by)
[12:40:49] <DragonPunch> ooh
[12:40:51] <DragonPunch> thats cool
[12:40:56] <DragonPunch> i nevr know you could do that
[12:40:57] <DragonPunch> nice
[12:41:00] <duch_kazatel> do what?
[12:41:21] <DragonPunch> have two functions
[12:41:22] <DragonPunch> like
[12:41:23] <hapyt0wn> $(document).ready(function()
[12:41:23] <hapyt0wn> {
[12:41:23] <hapyt0wn>     $( ".helpboxes" ).click(function() {
[12:41:23] <hapyt0wn>         alert( "you clicked overlay" );
[12:41:23] <hapyt0wn>     });
[12:41:24] <hapyt0wn> }
[12:41:24] <DragonPunch> .hover has two functions
[12:41:25] <duch_kazatel> wiag.
[12:41:26] <hapyt0wn> not working....
[12:41:28] <hapyt0wn> :(
[12:41:33] <duch_kazatel> hapyt0wn not cool.
[12:41:35] <duch_kazatel> make a fiddle.
[12:43:20] <hapyt0wn> got it
[12:43:21] <hapyt0wn> fail
[12:43:28] <hapyt0wn> should've put the console up
[12:43:35] <duch_kazatel> hapyt0wn in the future, don't paste code into the channel.
[12:43:35] <hapyt0wn> missing ')'
[12:43:37] <duch_kazatel> that's a big no-no
[12:43:49] <hapyt0wn> sad panda
[12:43:52] <hapyt0wn> will abide to it
[12:43:55] <hapyt0wn> :)
[12:43:56] <duch_kazatel> gracias.
[12:47:29] <hapyt0wn> I'm new to using this irc page
[12:55:57] <hapyt0wn> any good jquery overlays?
[12:56:02] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[12:56:07] <duch_kazatel> you mean modals?
[13:04:04] <duch_kazatel> welp
[13:06:42] <NoiseEee> fry day
[13:07:12] <duch_kazatel> gotta get down
[13:17:28] <Sal> decx, thanks, sorry if i wasn't here, i have problems with my mom, she's old and needs help
[13:20:23] <naftilos76> Hi, is there a shorter way to get the last row id of a table than this: table.find("tr:last")[0].id  ??
[13:21:51] <duch_kazatel> you could just do .prop('id')
[13:21:54] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, that's about it./
[13:22:26] <aerth> IE8 doesn't work with jquery-2.1.0 ?
[13:22:43] <duch_kazatel> http://jquery.com/browser-support/\
[13:22:47] <duch_kazatel> * http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[13:22:53] <duch_kazatel> aerth the 2.x series targets 9 and above.
[13:23:09] <duch_kazatel> the 1.x series is 6 and above.  the current versions of both 2.x and 1.x have the same features
[13:23:53] <aerth> so i can replace with jquery1.x for compatibility
[13:24:16] <duch_kazatel> yes.  if you're using 2.1.4, for instance, you'd use 1.11.3
[13:24:18] <naftilos76> who uses IE 8?
[13:24:28] <duch_kazatel> naftilos76 a lot of my customers :)
[13:24:36] <aerth> using https://github.com/Gaya/QueryLoader2 testing on IE
[13:24:41] <duch_kazatel> 7 and 8 are still out in the wild much more than you'd think.
[13:25:04] <duch_kazatel> aerth that doesn't require JQ do work.
[13:25:05] * aerth never uses IE ever but it came with windows 7 and i am testing
[13:28:10] <aerth> may go with an alert like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10964966/detect-ie-version-prior-to-v9-in-javascript/10965203#10965203
[13:28:17] <duch_kazatel> woah wait.
[13:28:21] <duch_kazatel> what are you doing?
[13:30:56] <aerth> a page im working on (using a cms) uses jquery for somethings. its included at the footer. it doesn't work on IE8. i am detecting IE<9 and changing the jquery version inserted. now how do i do it
[13:31:05] <duch_kazatel> uh.
[13:31:08] <duch_kazatel> don't change it.
[13:31:14] <duch_kazatel> just use the 1.x series and you're done.
[13:31:20] <aerth> ah thanks
[13:31:22] <duch_kazatel> like, don't dynamically load another version.
[13:32:01] <aerth> makes sense. whats the point of changing versions of they do the same thing? ex: why use 2.x?
[13:32:13] <duch_kazatel> because you don't want to support older versions of I.
[13:32:14] <duch_kazatel> *IE
[13:32:21] <aerth> browsehappy
[13:32:30] <duch_kazatel> and you don't see a point in including the JS that's designed to support those browsers.
[13:32:37] <duch_kazatel> smaller file, less to execute, etc.
[13:33:32] <Kamuela> aerth: 2.x takes out all the code required for the workarounds in the older browsers. so it's a bit faster and a lot smaller
[13:34:01] <aerth> ok before yesterday i didn't treat IE like it existed.
[13:34:04] <duch_kazatel> er.
[13:34:09] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela "a lot" is an overstatement.
[13:34:27] <Kamuela> in terms of percentage aren't we talking 30%?
[13:34:41] <aerth> anyway thanks
[13:34:46] <duch_kazatel> current 1.x is 93.71k while current 2.x is 82.37k
[13:34:53] <aerth> small anyways
[13:34:53] <duch_kazatel> aerth ah. heh
[13:35:13] <Kamuela> guess more like 15%
[13:35:25] <duch_kazatel> still smaller than most images ;)
[13:35:56] <Kamuela> yes i don't know if it's a bot message or something but i'm rather fond of "consider removing an image instead"
[13:36:11] <duch_kazatel> or just compress your images.
[13:36:22] <duch_kazatel> if less than 100k is a dealbreaker on your site, you have other issues.
[13:36:24] <Kamuela> i've gotta learn more about gzip
[13:37:07] <Kamuela> well i'm moving a vanilla js widget to react right now so far no issues beyond the first few
[13:37:14] <Kamuela> and yeah it's definitely gonna be heavier now
[13:37:29] <Kamuela> but i traded some load time for maintanability
[13:38:41] <Kamuela> honestly i'm getting tired of this project and i know i'm doing some amateurish stuff especially with how i'm encoding my data and requiring maps all over the place to fix what's probably just a bad decision initially
[13:41:01] <NoiseEee> "one less jpg"
[14:09:49] <plamb> what sorts of things can be passed into .html()
[14:17:47] <NoiseEee> markup
[14:17:54] <NoiseEee> text
[14:18:05] <Uhkis> strings

[15:01:24] <jak2000> hi all, how to do a POST with jQuery:  http://localhost:55094/jinvmanz/tarcarga.jsp?wtarima=&wnoemb=&wtipo=1
[15:01:34] <jak2000> this a get method but i want do it with post
[18:44:28] <LindsayMac> Hey folks. I'm trying to work out why my autocomplete won't trigger on functions added to the DOM via a click event. I am re-binding the "autocomplete" on focus of the input, I would think that would be enough to make it work.. it works for the first set of inputs but not for any added after..
[18:44:33] <LindsayMac> code coming up now...
[18:48:28] <LindsayMac> arg.. cant get the jsfiddle JSON echo thing
[19:14:22] <shoky> LindsayMac:  $.post('/echo/json/', {json: your_json_string_here}).done(function(data) { ... })
[19:14:51] <LindsayMac> shoky:  yea I am finding a strange issue with my nested JSON now... its all working fine in terms of getting the data
[19:14:53] <shoky> though you don't really need to use it
[19:15:54] <LindsayMac> yea.. i'm not.. i'm just trying to figure out why my data structure seems wrong even though I took it directly from my endpoint
[19:15:58] <LindsayMac> https://jsfiddle.net/lindsayanng/L5w3n5Lj/27/
[19:17:56] <LindsayMac> I mean, you can still get thge gist of the problem.. but its not as pretty
[19:18:45] <shoky> no idea where i'm supposed to be looking ;p
[19:19:53] <shoky> and why are you doing all these focus games
[19:20:11] <Dr-007> i'm having trouble resetting my Interval with jquery. any help would be appreciated -> http://jsbin.com/roxejotiku/edit?js,output
[19:21:06] <LindsayMac> shoky:  well the issue I came here for was because the autocomplete does not work if you add another field set (click the = sign)
[19:21:34] <LindsayMac> shoky:  So i was re-binding on focus of the input just to see if that would rebind the focus to the input.. in my server version, it works... kind
[19:21:45] <shoky> = sign?
[19:22:10] <LindsayMac> shit.. i'm sorry. i hate when people do this, but I have to leave. Just got the call that friend's car broke down and I have to get them from the side of the road....
[19:22:54] <shoky> Dr-007: not sure what you're doing really, but  clearInterval(update_confirm);   is wrong,  should be  clearInterval(update_timer)
[19:23:08] <shoky> no prob LindsayMac
[19:23:16] <shoky> good luck with that ;p
[19:23:29] <LindsayMac> shoky:  but an FYI.. on my server it binds to the new input fields 99% of the time. Every so often, which no consistency, it will sort of bind. You type into the field and the autocomplete triggers but it triggers on the field group before it with that field's value
[19:23:43] <LindsayMac> i was trying to make a use case to replicate but now struggling with the JSON data as a whole
[19:24:02] <LindsayMac> shoky:  but yea.. thanks.. i'll have to be back later. Rain and stuck sucks.. dont want to leave her there too long
[19:25:07] <Dr-007> shoky, ahhh damn
[19:25:16] <Dr-007> thanks :)
[19:59:02] <AbuDhar> anyone here who is not sleeping?
[19:59:14] <Oka> Nope.
[19:59:19] <duch_kazatel> all aslpee.
[19:59:21] <duch_kazatel> *asleep
[19:59:45] <AbuDhar> heheh
[19:59:53] <AbuDhar> so I have a question...
[20:00:00] <duch_kazatel> welp
[20:00:13] <AbuDhar> I am using the <video> element of html5 but I want to force full width so I don't see those grey sides
[20:00:18] <AbuDhar> is there a way besides object-fit?
[20:00:31] <AbuDhar> maybe some jquery can do it?
[20:04:25] <duch_kazatel> why not just use object-fit?
[20:05:36] <duch_kazatel> https://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php
[20:05:39] <duch_kazatel> for some reading material.
[20:06:19] <AbuDhar> object fit is not supported by all browsers yet :D
[20:06:25] <duch_kazatel> nor is video ;)
[20:06:34] <duch_kazatel> check out the article i linked and go from there.
[20:06:42] <AbuDhar> duch_kazatel: I looked at that article..
[20:06:46] <AbuDhar> well object-fit works fine right now
[20:07:58] <AbuDhar> video is supported by almost all browsers
[20:08:01] <AbuDhar> except IE8
[20:08:40] <AbuDhar> and nobody should use IE8 anymore lol
[20:08:55] <duch_kazatel> that's not true.
[20:08:56] <duch_kazatel> but ok.
[20:10:39] <AbuDhar> http://caniuse.com/#feat=video
[20:10:41] <AbuDhar> and opera mini
[20:20:30] <theskillwithin> nobody should use IE anymore
[20:20:32] <theskillwithin> *
[20:21:08] <theskillwithin> we should have Fuck IE day and make all our clients sites at once have a splash page just for IE traffic saying, GET A DIFFERENT BROWSER
[20:21:27] <theskillwithin> We don't like your kind around these parts!
