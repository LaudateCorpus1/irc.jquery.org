[00:13:53] <Yepp> cant get an element using find/closest: http://www.hastebin.com/ubifituxab.hs
[00:13:57] <Yepp> can grab the object by using children tho
[00:14:07] <Yepp> why is that?
[00:17:46] <Yepp> it returns [prevObject, context]
[00:27:56] <Jerrry> Hey guys, I have a general question. If I want to build a single page application where the URL changes depending on the state, and the back button works as you'd expect with no reloads, how would I go about making that?
[00:42:11] <rfc19> Hello, I'm trying to make theses images clickable, but am having no luck. Excuse the pasted source in the CSS and JS fields: https://jsfiddle.net/jay1rwkp/2/
[00:43:56] <Uhkis> rfc19: use the external resources on the left panel to add external libraries instead of pasting
[00:45:07] <rfc19> Uhkis: where can I store the external resources if I'm developing locally?
[00:45:38] <Uhkis> just use <script> tags as usual?
[00:46:28] <Uhkis> and your images are clickable in that fiddle already?
[00:46:56] <rfc19> .. not on my fiddle :/
[00:47:10] <Uhkis> at least the alert works just fine
[00:47:16] <rfc19> Let me change browsers
[00:47:27] <Uhkis> im on firefox
[00:47:56] <rfc19> Ok, that's weird. That works for me on FF, but not on Chrome. Maybe there's something wrong with my Chrome.
[00:48:17] <rfc19> Thanks for that. Lesson learned - check all browsers
[00:48:31] <Uhkis> sec, ill check chrome too
[00:48:54] <Uhkis> works too
[00:49:19] <Uhkis> probably some addon
[00:50:45] <rfc19> Still doesn't work on my actual site in any browser
[00:51:27] <Uhkis> well there might be a lot more things to mess up that
[00:51:38] <rfc19> Agreed
[01:08:41] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I am trying to create a progress bar for every file that is dropped into my dropzone area
[01:08:43] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> http://pastebin.com/ng8eUwBX
[01:09:52] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I append a new span with the filename class (will change that later just trying to get it to work atm), and then call a function to upload it, which in turn uses jquery uis progressbar. However, the appended span cant be found in the function
[01:10:20] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> not sure how I would go about adding the span differently since I am using .on already, then calling the function
[02:52:05] <helloNL> Hey, we are using chosen-select on a dropdown where you can choose a user where something is assigned to, the problem is that when we use are script for a button to assign it to the logged in user that the chosen-select isn't responsive anymore. The code for the assign-to-me: http://kopy.io/NcWPi
[02:52:32] <helloNL> Without the class btn-assign-to-me it is responsive :/
[03:08:04] <Yepp> couldn't set the options properly, what am i missing? https://gist.github.com/xxRockOnxx/3606f1b4ebc0b937efffc3137a76c915
[03:36:33] <helloNL> Could anyone help me with my issue?
[05:32:05] <AimlessRaven> someone knows how to set click event on .select2-result-label
[05:38:56] <dwebber88> AimlessRaven $('.select2-result-label').on('click', function(){ /*yourcodehere*/ });
[05:39:12] <dwebber88> be sure to use document ready for it
[05:48:40] <IamTrying> var html_div = $('#div_parent').find('.i_selected');   $.each( html_div , function(k,v){ console.log( html_div.attr('id') );  }); - How do i get the 3 ID's? its only printing first i_selected id
[05:51:27] <IamTrying> Never mind working when i did v.id;
[05:59:57] <AimlessRaven> dwebber88: its not work
[06:00:37] <decx> use map to map data from a collection that's what it's there for
[06:09:45] <charllie> hello I want to ask a specific question. Is traversing a DOM is faster than using the selector?
[06:12:23] <dwebber88> AimlessRaven, use $(document).ready(function(){ /* given code here */ }); It should work
[07:16:43] <MarkTheMark> how do i add class to different entity upon click? is this correct? $('.login_button').find('.login_window').addClass('show');
[07:17:58] <jerit> looks about right
[07:18:06] <jerit> err... rather
[07:18:37] <jerit> $('.login_button').on('click', function () { $('.login_window').show(); }
[07:18:40] <jerit> that might be better
[07:19:14] <jerit> why does everyone use single quotes though? I hate the single quotes
[07:19:27] <MarkTheMark> missing ) at the end.
[07:19:41] <MarkTheMark> and for some reason, it’ snot functioning..
[07:20:53] <MarkTheMark> ah..
[07:21:01] <MarkTheMark> you put show() instead of addclass..
[07:21:44] <jerit> mhmm
[07:21:51] <jerit> and .hide() as well to make it go away
[07:22:00] <MarkTheMark> i have to give it animation so.
[07:22:16] <MarkTheMark> but still doesn’t work $('.login_button').on('click', function () { $('.login_window').addClass('show'); })
[07:27:10] <jerit> MarkTheMark https://jsfiddle.net/o120w60L/
[07:31:15] <jerit> this is nerve wracking to say the least... I'm writing code to handle an error that I've only managed to make happen 10 times in 15000 tests
[07:31:47] <jerit> So with any luck, I'm never going to see this code work, but at the same time, I need to know that it does actually work
[07:34:10] <burzum2> hi
[07:34:29] <burzum2> why would this selector hide input type=submit as well? http://pastebin.com/ZTvRkDHB
[07:41:25] <shoky> burzum2: because the attribute not-equals selector also selects elements that don't have that attribute at all. so your input type=submit is an input that doesn't have that attribute
[07:41:48] <shoky> https://api.jquery.com/attribute-not-equal-selector/
[07:59:04] <burzum2> shoky thank you!
[08:38:36] <MikeD_> the irony of so many misspellings at http://www.javascriptspellcheck.com/jquery-spell-check/
[08:58:24] <manoj_> hello
[09:00:06] <taplar> aloha
[09:56:23] <arup_r> Can I submit form using Jquery submit() method as put ? I tried https://jsfiddle.net/p82b46wv/, but this did not work
[09:57:06] <arup_r> my code submits the form as GET request
[09:59:41] <taplar> should be able to
[10:00:00] <taplar> instead of html(), console log the prop('outerHTML') and see what it looks like
[10:00:24] <arup_r> ok
[10:01:41] <arup_r> it is printing <form action="/admins/plans/1" method="put"><input name="utf8" value="✓" type="hidden"><input name="authenticity_token" value="+ntIlC7uFDw==" type="hidden"><input name="plan[expired]" value="false" type="hidden"></form>
[10:08:09] <taplar> ah
[10:08:11] <taplar> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8054165/using-put-method-in-html-form
[10:09:16] <taplar> so i guess a true put request would need to be an ajax request
[10:10:04] <arup_r> hm
[10:16:58] <eva_> So I want to run a function on both $(window).on('resize') and $(document).ready
[10:17:04] <eva_> How can I combine these two events?
[10:17:15] <taplar> extract the logic to a function and reuse it
[10:28:42] <jerit> so I've written a fix now that should have my ajax post attempt a retry if it fails. Problem is that my API is so solid its only failing about 1 time in 1500 posts
[10:28:46] <jerit> I have no idea how to force it
[10:28:57] <jerit> so I can't practically test this now I don't think
[10:29:42] <taplar> you could make your back end randomly return with an error
[10:30:24] <taplar> or change your ajax request to a url that should bomb and watch and see if it tries again
[10:33:50] <jerit> actually that's not too difficult to do either way :) thanks taplar
[10:34:16] <jerit> was thinking I should kill SQL Server or something but I can't do that because all the databases would go down not just this one
[11:38:07] <m----> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38625158/jquery-ui-dialog-save-position-via-php any idea why my coordinates are always the same via POST?
[11:38:48] <m----> i'm adjusting the dialog and it doesn't change
[11:39:04] <m----> it always stores the same value in mysql
[11:48:29] <taplar> a fiddle showing the issue would be helpful
[11:48:46] <robertmaxrees> my favorite thing to hear.
[11:49:19] <taplar> mine is 'pants optional'
[11:49:22] <taplar> i see we have different tastes
[11:49:29] <robertmaxrees> hah
[11:49:34] <graphettion_> Nice.
[11:50:01] <graphettion_> Did you get those jeans on sale? Cause they are 100% off at my place.
[11:50:08] <taplar> lmao
[11:50:30] <Uhkis> :D
[11:50:54] <graphettion_> Trying to relieve robertmaxrees from all the attitudes he's been getting lately
[11:50:55] <graphettion_> ;)
[11:51:01] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[11:51:06] <graphettion_> teehee
[11:51:09] <robertmaxrees> oh you
[11:51:20] <graphettion_> What about me homie?
[11:51:31] <robertmaxrees> keepin' it trill, g.
[11:51:34] <Uhkis> bobby has gotten attitude?
[11:51:44] <graphettion_> Come at me bro! :P
[11:51:46] <graphettion_> No.
[11:51:54] <graphettion_> Dealing with ppl in this channel who has attitude.
[11:52:05] <graphettion_> He got tired of it one day.
[11:52:07] <Uhkis> that's what i meant :)
[11:52:15] <graphettion_> Ah, then yessir!
[11:52:20] <taplar> mam
[11:52:29] <Uhkis> wow!
[11:53:03] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, do you bobby. We know you're awesome.
[11:53:03] <Uhkis> taplar: that's just rude!
[11:53:15] <taplar> but accurate?
[11:53:20] <robertmaxrees> hey, i appreciate it.
[11:53:37] <Uhkis> taplar: only 100% off
[11:53:42] <taplar> :o
[11:53:42] <graphettion_> You're welcome. I have great respect for people who take time out of their day to help others.
[11:53:55] <taplar> could have sworn it was said one time uhkis was a chicka
[11:54:33] <Uhkis> whoever said that is a dirty liar
[11:55:03] <graphettion_> :O
[11:55:10] <taplar> welp.  great start to the day
[11:55:55] <Uhkis> start? how early it is there?
[11:56:08] <robertmaxrees> almost 9 am here.
[11:56:15] <taplar> my brain doesn't kick in till almost lunch
[11:56:20] <taplar> almost 11
[11:56:26] <Uhkis> almost 19
[11:56:53] <Uhkis> and now you poor americans are confused? :D
[11:57:03] <robertmaxrees> that's 7:00pm ;)
[11:57:06] <taplar> nah, we're all down with the military
[11:57:08] <robertmaxrees> (i use 24hr on all my stuff)
[11:57:41] <Uhkis> robertmaxrees: well you did travel europe iirc
[11:57:53] <taplar> not i.  i understand it and convert it quickly, but i'm down to clown with the pm
[11:58:27] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis i always use 24hr for my own stuff, but whenever somebody asks me the time i have to tell them in 12hr format.
[11:58:42] <Uhkis> well, no one actually says "19" in real life here either
[11:58:56] <Uhkis> but it's always written 19 instead of 7
[11:58:59] <taplar> i'll send military time in emails and texts sometimes if I don't want there to be any chance of confusion
[11:59:09] <robertmaxrees> right.  but that's how i got used to the conversions.  also: anything IT related.
[11:59:18] <Uhkis> taplar: you've clearly seen dumb and dumber
[11:59:18] <taplar> ^
[11:59:30] <taplar> sure, though i'm lost on the relation
[11:59:34] <taplar> *reference
[11:59:38] <robertmaxrees> also i worked on a crew that did overnight stuff and we always have to be explicit about what time on what day things happened.
[11:59:53] <Uhkis> taplar: lets see if youtube has the scene!
[12:00:30] <taplar> i only saw the first and maybe the second one.  i didn't see the latest one
[12:00:55] <taplar> i'm kinda over jim carey movies now.
[12:02:24] <Uhkis> can't find it. i was talking about the original 1994 one
[12:02:41] <Uhkis> something about meeting at a bar at 8 and he was there 8am
[12:03:00] <taplar> ah
[12:05:11] * taplar plays some hooty
[12:08:12] <graphettion_> I miss Friday the movie.
[12:10:02] <Uhkis> fridays were pretty good movies
[12:12:55] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey guys, I am trying to create a progress bar for every file that is dropped into my dropzone area
[12:12:57] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> http://pastebin.com/ng8eUwBX
[12:13:14] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I append a new span with the filename class (will change that later just trying to get it to work atm), and then call a function to upload it, which in turn uses jquery uis progressbar. However, the appended span cant be found in the function
[12:13:26] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> not sure how I would go about adding the span differently since I am using .on already, then calling the function
[12:13:39] <m----> weird if it's draggable it gets the coordinates
[12:13:53] <m---->     $("#menu").draggable({ but     $("#menu").dialog({ always returns the same coordinates
[12:14:30] <taplar> UnfixedSNIPERJ: your passing the file into the method
[12:14:40] <taplar> but your referencing a file_name i don't see defined in there
[12:15:03] <taplar> did you mean it to be file.name?
[12:15:07] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i accidentally deleted that when i was cleaning it up for display, it is actually there as: var file_name = file.name;
[12:15:50] <taplar> i also don't see formData defined in the top part
[12:17:02] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> thats defined as well, everything works as far as the file uploading properly, i just cant get the progressbar to work
[12:17:25] <taplar> so could you make the pastebin more complete so i'm not thinking your stuff is broken? ;)
[12:17:25] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> $('.' + file_name).progressbar doesnt work when i append the element
[12:17:32] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> but if I define it before the page loads it works
[12:18:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> yeah ill post the corrected version, I tried to delete as much as I could so it would be easier to read
[12:18:36] <taplar> that's appreciated
[12:19:47] <taplar> wait
[12:19:57] <taplar> your using the file name as a class?
[12:20:22] <taplar> class="myfile.txt"
[12:20:23] <taplar> ?
[12:22:18] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> taplar, yes, only for now to until i get it working, I have also tried using a variable that a just var++ after each run
[12:22:19] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> http://pastebin.com/KyqVexC8
[12:22:33] <taplar> your going to have issues with that
[12:22:41] <taplar> '.' is a special character for selectors
[12:22:56] <taplar> '.myfile.txt' is going to look for an element with the class 'myfile' and 'txt'
[12:23:26] <taplar> i'd rethink that, personally
[12:23:35] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> ^__________________________________________^
[12:24:36] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> yeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhh im an idiot lol, I originally was doing that to correct another issue I was having with an progressing integer, and I fogot about that lol
[12:25:16] <taplar> i guess you could do files[i].name.split('.').join(' ') for the element
[12:25:18] <taplar> then it might work
[12:25:23] <taplar> but that's strange
[12:25:43] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> im just going to go back to a progressively added int after each loop lol
[12:26:06] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> thats what I was doing in the first place, and intended to do as soon as I figured out this "issue"
[12:26:14] <taplar> :)
[12:26:34] <taplar> if you wanted you could put the name as a data element
[12:26:39] <taplar> give them all a common class
[12:27:07] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> I shouldnt touch things under no sleep, thanks for pointing out my incompetence. im going to go to bed now
[12:27:12] <taplar> $parent.find('.theclass').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('filename') === file.name; })
[12:27:37] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> and thats an even better idea, thats what I do in other parts of this very script lol
[12:28:15] * taplar *beatboxes* refactor!
[13:41:08] <jose3_> How come I cant get this function to return the value ? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/74de5cc00c9b6398f3f6a785fdb31b0a
[13:41:29] <robertmaxrees> where is it returning to?
[13:41:40] <robertmaxrees> the binding has already run - you're returning to jquery.
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> and the parent function that you're probably calling this from has already finished running.
[13:42:28] <jose3_> Its not within anything when I call it
[13:42:33] <jose3_> oh
[13:42:37] <robertmaxrees> then what are you expecting to happen?
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> you're returning out of a click event handler.
[13:43:24] <jose3_> Ohh I think i see what is happening
[13:43:26] <jose3_> thanks
[14:41:31] <jerit> what determines when I'm doing a PUT instead of a POST?
[14:42:09] <jerit> for example, I'm sending data to my API which it is to use in order to update 2 records in my database but I can just POST this data, no?
[14:42:39] <robertmaxrees> are you asking per REST or just in general?
[14:42:52] <jerit> in general
[14:43:04] <jerit> never done anything with PUT so I suppose I should do some reading
[14:43:22] <robertmaxrees> generally, you use post.
[14:43:27] <snover> PUT is just a different verb than POST
[14:44:02] <robertmaxrees> depending on who you ask, one is for creating and the other is for updating.  or one is for creating, and the other is for creating OR updating, depending.
[14:44:23] <snover> nobody implements REST correctly so it doesn’t really matter :)
[14:44:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:44:29] * jerit wonders if he can have 2 post actions in his api controller
[14:45:07] <jerit> suppose it'd then be just a matter of posting the data with which the record is to be updated on a different action
[14:45:16] <jerit> but this is going outside of the scope of jquery
[14:49:05] <taplar> PUT is meant for a complete replacement of the <element>
[14:57:56] <FalsAlarm> can anyone help me get my JS working?  i get no output so how do i know the facebook javascript library even loaded?  http://canadeals.com is where my site is at
[14:58:11] <FalsAlarm> how do i know if i put my js in the right place?
[14:58:25] <taplar> js goes in the header or the bottom of the body
[14:58:39] <taplar> you can check your network tab to see if it's loaded
[14:58:49] <FalsAlarm> in chrome?
[14:58:56] <taplar> or ff, yup
[14:59:23] <taplar> F12, click the network tab, refresh the related page
[14:59:32] <FalsAlarm> ok yes
[14:59:47] <FalsAlarm> it shows the facebook-javascript-sdk.js file was 200
[15:00:23] <FalsAlarm> i wonder why the button doesn't load
[15:00:28] <FalsAlarm> it used to load before
[15:01:03] <taplar> no console errors?
[15:02:16] <FalsAlarm> taplar, none at all
[15:02:25] <FalsAlarm> just the failed load of the favicon
[15:02:32] <taplar> ?
[15:02:33] <FalsAlarm> but i'll fix that alter
[15:03:31] <FalsAlarm> taplar, do you know what could be causin the problem?
[15:03:46] <FalsAlarm> visit my site at http://canadeals.com and view the source
[15:03:54] <FalsAlarm> see if i'm doing it right? pls pls pls
[15:05:04] <taplar> idk anything about that library
[15:05:31] <taplar> idk if it is even an extension of jquery
[15:05:54] <taplar> were did you get it?
[15:06:34] <FalsAlarm> from facebook
[15:06:56] <taplar> right, which one?
[15:08:16] <FalsAlarm> https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart
[15:08:22] <FalsAlarm> this is the library
[15:08:46] <FalsAlarm> instead of loading it asynchronously from fb servers, i ripped a copy of it and saved it and i load it normally
[15:08:53] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:08:57] <taplar> yeah, so that's not jquery
[15:08:59] <robertmaxrees> why not load it from their servers?
[15:09:07] <robertmaxrees> also ^
[15:09:08] <taplar> you might want to hit up ##javascript
[15:11:24] <robertmaxrees> FalsAlarm you want to load it from their servers fwiw.
[15:12:04] <Jerrry> Does anyone know Handlebars JS? Is there a way to simplify accessing a bunch of nested paths? {{comment.body}} {{comment.id}} {{comment.username}} etc.
[15:12:20] <taplar> Jerrry: you can do that, sure
[15:12:30] <taplar> oh, simplify
[15:12:58] <taplar> block the section with {{#comment}}{{/comment}}
[15:13:06] <taplar> then you should be able to use just the inners inside it
[15:13:13] <taplar> those details should be on their website
[15:14:12] <Jerrry> taplar: Thanks, I'll try that.
[15:14:40] <Jerrry> Yup, exactly what I was looking for.
[15:23:13] <cmrabet> Hi all
[15:23:50] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[15:24:27] <cmrabet> Have two variables which are numbers, var a=2,b=4; when I try to conform with them an array like myarray.push([a,b]); it creates ["2","4"].. adding quotes to the numbers.. why? I don't want the quoted, I want [2,4]. Thanks.
[15:24:58] <taplar> how are you seeing the ""?

[15:26:13] <robertmaxrees> you're not coercing type anywhere in your example, so I'd need to see more.
[15:26:32] <cmrabet> check the piece of code here

[15:27:40] <cmrabet> the reason why I encountered this problem is because I'm feeding the array values to a highcharts chart, which complained saying that my values are text
[15:27:42] <robertmaxrees> toFixed() returns a string.
[15:27:47] <cmrabet> what?
[15:27:48] <cmrabet> really
[15:27:55] <robertmaxrees> yes.  it's meant for display purposes.
[15:28:04] <cmrabet> shit, that makes sense
[15:28:23] <cmrabet> mmmm
[15:28:32] <robertmaxrees> math.round is likely what you want.
[15:28:45] <robertmaxrees> i assume you want always 2 decimals?
[15:29:13] <phaze> Hi. I have a weird issue with the :not selector. When using it alone like ':not(.selector)' it does not work, but with a group selector like 'a:not(.selector)' it does. Any ideas? Fiddle here: https://jsfiddle.net/0uuqxxbh/2/
[15:29:15] <cmrabet> I thought Math.round() rounded to the nearest integer, I want to keep floats
[15:29:26] <cmrabet> floats with 2 decimals
[15:29:33] <robertmaxrees> cmrabet Math.round(num * 100) / 100
[15:29:36] <robertmaxrees> you want this.
[15:29:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:29:47] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: oh
[15:30:18] <robertmaxrees> phaze soooo couple issues - first off data attributes aren't really booleans.
[15:30:27] <taplar> round or floor?
[15:30:29] <cmrabet> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[15:30:37] <robertmaxrees> phaze also: need to give it a tagname there.
[15:30:42] <robertmaxrees> psuedoselectors don't work on their own.
[15:30:42] <taplar> guess it depends
[15:31:07] <Jerrry> If in my Handlebars template I want to combine a Javascript variable homeUrl with a template variable {{profileImage}}, inside the src="" of an img tag, how do I do that? The homeUrl variable is necessary to get it from php.
[15:31:33] <taplar> this is what i get for throwing one out there, :)
[15:31:37] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:32:16] <taplar> there is a #handlebars room
[15:32:26] <phaze> robertmaxrees: Oh, so I have to provide a value for the data attribute AND group it with another selector like a:not(..) ?
[15:32:27] <Jerrry> I know, but it has like 5 people.
[15:32:53] <Jerrry> I just asked there.
[15:32:55] <Jerrry> Thanks.
[15:33:01] <robertmaxrees> Jerrry fwiw you're going to have limited success here trying to get support for non-jquery related stuff (shrug) you're welcome to try buuuut no promises.
[15:33:17] <robertmaxrees> phaze yeah - use classes for this stuff instead.
[15:33:29] <robertmaxrees> a data attribute doesn't really make sense here anyway.
[15:34:54] <phaze> robertmaxrees: We kinda have a code policy where I work, where we can't tie CSS-classes to javascript behaviour. We always have to use data attributes to match event listeners and such. I'll find a way. Thanks!
[15:35:05] <taplar> o.o
[15:35:07] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[15:35:14] <robertmaxrees> I would seriously start campaigning against doing that.
[15:35:17] <taplar> that's sad
[15:35:27] <robertmaxrees> data attrutes are meant to store data, not to be selected on/used for event handling.
[15:35:42] <robertmaxrees> "CSS classes" is also a misnomer.
[15:36:21] <robertmaxrees> they're just classes.  they're meant for css AND js.  if you really feel like you need to distinguish, prepend them with "js-" for js-specific classes, but policies like that never made much sense to me.
[15:36:24] <taplar> phaze: do you know the reasoning behind that policy?
[15:36:46] <robertmaxrees> 5 bucks says it's because the designers want to be able to make changes without breaking JS.
[15:37:19] <taplar> heh, paired with lack of unit tests, ya? ;)
[15:37:21] <phaze> Oh, really? We're encouraged to do it "The Basecamp Way", like described in this article: http://brandonhilkert.com/blog/organizing-javascript-in-rails-application-with-turbolinks/
[15:37:34] <phaze> It starts in the "User-Triggered Javascript" section.
[15:37:49] <robertmaxrees> that's going backwards.
[15:38:07] <phaze> Honestly, I'm a bit new to this, so even though I found it odd, I felt like it was too early to fight them on pre-established rules.
[15:38:16] <phaze> But I see what you mean.
[15:38:27] <robertmaxrees> ask why they don't just cut to the chase and use onclick.
[15:38:49] <phaze> Instead of attaching events to the document, you mean?
[15:38:58] <robertmaxrees> no, instead of using those data attributes.
[15:39:30] <robertmaxrees> the markup should just be a document with good semantics.  using data attributes in your HTML to prescribe behavior is just like using onclick
[15:39:30] <taplar> from the looks of this, this seems more about tieing the js to the rails.  not don't use classes in general for hooks
[15:40:33] <phaze> My example was a bit contrived, in actuality it doesn't use the click event, it's meant to disable a ajax callback
[15:40:35] <phaze> $(document).on 'ajax:error', ':not([data-skip-error-callback])', (e, data, status, xhr) ->
[15:40:41] <phaze> Pardon the CoffeeScript :P
[15:40:47] <robertmaxrees> phaze same difference.
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> you're giving your html knowledge of your application layer.
[15:40:59] <robertmaxrees> which is hell of gross.
[15:41:03] <robertmaxrees> (imo)
[15:41:24] <taplar> you also have a ton of listeners on the document too probably
[15:41:35] <phaze> Really? But doesn't it make sense to separate presentation and logic? I guess you could do that with the js- prepended classnames like you suggested.
[15:41:57] <robertmaxrees> except that your data attributes are the exact opposite of separating them :)
[15:42:12] <taplar> $('.menu').on('click', '.menu-item', function(){ /* do stuff */ });
[15:42:20] <taplar> what does that tell you about the markup?
[15:42:23] <robertmaxrees> you're making your presentation layer aware (and prescriptive!) of what logic should happen.
[15:42:28] <taplar> more so, what does that dictate about the markup?
[15:42:30] <taplar> very little
[15:42:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[15:42:38] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++++++++
[15:42:42] <taplar> but you know the business logic that should happen
[15:43:52] <phaze> taplar: Until the designers decide to rename the classes in a design iteration or something like that. Then the JS is broken too. It's intention revealing, sure, but it also feels a bit fragile.
[15:44:03] <robertmaxrees> actually
[15:44:04] <taplar> how so?
[15:44:07] <robertmaxrees> so here's the thing
[15:44:16] <robertmaxrees> your styles and your application logic are already tied together.
[15:44:36] <robertmaxrees> your JS is already adding/removing classes and all that.
[15:44:48] <robertmaxrees> also: you shouldn't have designers working in a silo without developer support.
[15:45:00] <taplar> and there should be unit tests
[15:45:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:45:16] <Hans-Martin> hi folks, I'm stumped with a dynamic controlgroup (fieldset with checkboxes). The first time it is filled, everything is fine. When I need to fill it the next time, I call empty() and refill, but the inner div with class "ui-controlgroup-controls" is missing (natch, I threw it away with the empty()) and is not being rebuilt, whatever I try :-(
[15:45:22] <taplar> if you don't have unit tests, all the best policies and the best intentions in the world are not going to save you from bugs
[15:45:25] <robertmaxrees> also: think of it this way - why are you having people write code if they... can't write code?
[15:45:37] <robertmaxrees> Hans-Martin have a fiddle?
[15:45:51] <Hans-Martin> robertmaxrees: not yet, good idea
[15:47:37] <phaze> taplar: We do have tests, but it still helps the front end developers to know that the can change style classes interchangeably without having to worry about breaking something. The data-tags reveal where the logic is attached.
[15:48:01] <robertmaxrees> but those data-tags can tie in logic that modifies which styles are applied.
[15:48:11] <robertmaxrees> so you're moving what can break to somewhere else.
[15:48:20] <phaze> It's been helpful hearing this perspective from you taplar and robertmaxrees, as I'm new, and kinda just accepted the existing rules as fact.
[15:48:23] <robertmaxrees> (we went through this exact same conversation where i work)
[15:48:33] <robertmaxrees> like, don't go and buck the trend or anything,.
[15:48:39] <robertmaxrees> but i'd start questioning that logic :
[15:49:17] <taplar> and also your not limited to style classes
[15:49:29] <taplar> back to what robert was saying earlier
[15:49:39] <taplar> they are classes.  they don't have to have a css rule related to them
[15:49:50] <taplar> you can have your classes and they can have theirs.
[15:50:01] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:50:03] <taplar> yours are probably going to be more readable, while theirs are framework classes and what not
[15:50:10] <phaze> I get that, but it's unclear if they have styling attached or not, just by looking at them
[15:50:19] <taplar> but you don't make that assumption
[15:50:20] <phaze> The js- prefix could help
[15:50:25] <taplar> hey, these are ours
[15:50:27] <taplar> those are yours
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> phaze sure, but right now you're presribing logic in your preentation layer.
[15:50:57] <taplar> do you use any framework like bootstrap or anything?
[15:51:11] <taplar> *library
[15:51:16] <phaze> Yes, we use bootstrap. And Rails, like you figured.
[15:51:34] <phaze> So it's not really a JS-heavy app
[15:51:47] <taplar> ok, so while they'll be using classes like 'col-md-4'
[15:51:55] <taplar> you'll be using classes like 'product-item'
[15:52:22] <taplar> 'shopping-cart-container'
[15:52:27] <taplar> etc
[15:52:32] <robertmaxrees> taplar and i work in ecommerce - not like you can tell by the classname examples hahahaha
[15:52:38] <taplar> :)
[15:53:22] <taplar> the point is reading stuff like my menu example up above is insightful, readable, and managable
[15:53:36] <taplar> you wouldn't want to see something like $('.col-md-5').on(...
[15:53:39] <taplar> wtf is that?
[15:54:03] <taplar> how do i know if i change that, what it might effect?
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> also: data attribute values can change out from under you and you can lose sync between your bindings and cached values.
[15:54:41] <phaze> Yeah I get that. We AJAX in a lot of content, so we have to bind events to the document, to make sure newly inserted HTML still hits those events. But I absolutely get your point.
[15:54:58] <robertmaxrees> are you fully replacing the document?
[15:55:04] <robertmaxrees> or just certain bits?
[15:55:35] <phaze> That varies. On some pages we use Turbolinks to swap the entire body tag, but mostly we target specific divs and replace their content with the response.
[15:55:43] <robertmaxrees> that seems heavy handed.
[15:56:31] <phaze> We could probably benefit from something like Backbone.js to take care of updating the DOM for us.
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> or react.
[15:57:23] <taplar> i may or may not dabble in handlebars
[15:57:27] <phaze> Sure. We generate a lot of data which we send back, which could probably have been described in JSON and updated by Backbone or React.
[15:57:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[15:57:40] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[15:57:44] <robertmaxrees> easier said than done
[15:57:51] <robertmaxrees> but that's where we're heading for some things.
[15:57:57] <phaze> We do it the DHH way -.- The majestic monolith.
[15:58:03] <taplar> dhh?
[15:58:20] <robertmaxrees> David Heinsmeier Hansson
[15:58:22] <phaze> David Heinemeier Hansson. Inventor of Rails.
[15:58:26] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:58:27] <taplar> ah
[15:58:37] <phaze> He has some pretty strong opinions on how these things should be done.
[15:58:42] <robertmaxrees> hence rails.
[15:58:44] <taplar> lots of programmers do
[15:59:07] <phaze> Which is why we use a lot of server generated HTML instead of small JSON responses
[15:59:23] <robertmaxrees> which is a very developer-centric way to handle it.
[15:59:30] <taplar> and puts more load on the line
[15:59:31] <phaze> Sure, but I hear something like React (though not comparable to Rails, I know) is a lot less opinionated.
[15:59:33] <robertmaxrees> can be a pain for devices on slow connections though.
[16:00:09] <taplar> limited data plans
[16:00:27] <taplar> fk that site, it eats my data! :D
[16:00:55] <phaze> Yeah absolutely. They try to combat this with Turbolinks, which pretty much turns every link into an AJAX request, which means we don't reinitialize the JS and we swap the body tag.
[16:00:57] <phaze> But still.
[16:00:59] <phaze> Lots of data...
[16:01:03] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[16:01:14] <robertmaxrees> then again, depending on your target demo and stuff, that may not matter.
[16:01:25] <taplar> does that help much though?  wouldn't the js be cached?
[16:01:37] <robertmaxrees> if you config your servers right, yeah.
[16:01:50] <robertmaxrees> but the browser rendering cycle can be a bit... heavy.
[16:02:19] <phaze> It is cached yeah, but everything is setup anew, every event, object definition and such.
[16:02:31] <taplar> sure sure
[16:02:35] <robertmaxrees> event bindings are cheap though.
[16:02:54] <robertmaxrees> and js is generally wicked fast now unless you're doing something strange.
[16:03:06] <phaze> But yeah, the client seems happy enough, and since we're a small team, we (read: the client) can't afford a rewrite.
[16:03:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:03:16] <robertmaxrees> all about the tradeoffsa.
[16:03:36] <phaze> Yeah absolutely, that's why we attach every event to the document without blinking, because benchmarking showed it didn't make any visible difference.
[16:03:40] <phaze> Absolutely.
[16:03:47] <taplar> ROI consideration of time spent refactors vs time spent researching issues
[16:04:33] <phaze> Yup, the scale might tip one day, where we find ourselves spending a majority of the day debugging instead of innovating.
[16:04:41] <taplar> i hate those days
[16:04:46] <robertmaxrees> ahahahahah
[16:04:58] <taplar> haaaaaate.  and i'm a chearful dude
[16:05:16] <phaze> Yeah, those days hurt like hell. Anyway, I need to get back to the code. Thanks for your help guys. I'll bring your suggestions back to my team :)
[16:05:29] <taplar> "Those random guys in jquery said..."
[16:05:40] <taplar> ;)
[16:13:13] <Hans-Martin> looks like creating a jqm fiddle from scratch will take a bit - I did not find up-to-date examples of fiddles with jqm 1.4.5, only older stuff. Is there a simple fiddle template from which to start? The fiddle Ive been able to come up with does not even begin to look like jqm :-(
[16:13:32] <robertmaxrees> Hans-Martin it's pretty easy to do yourself.
[16:14:06] <graphettion_> Don't be shy. jsfiddle <3's you!
[16:14:21] <taplar> phss, fiddle b a playa
[16:14:22] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2akwj8m4/
[16:14:29] <robertmaxrees> external resources are your friend.
[16:14:30] <graphettion_> lol
[16:14:37] <robertmaxrees> oh jquery mobile?
[16:14:45] <robertmaxrees> just replace the jqui links with the jqm ones.
[16:41:08] <yottabyte> why would you ever do $.when($.ajax(...)).done vs $.ajax(...).done?
[16:41:16] <yottabyte> theres' no point, right?
[16:41:30] <robertmaxrees> unless you have multiple $.ajax() calls.
[16:41:39] <robertmaxrees> and you should tendto favor .then(), but that's beside the point.
[16:44:40] <yottabyte> robertmaxrees: how would you do .then if you have multiple ajax calls? I know you can do $.when($.ajax(...), ..., $.ajax(...)).done
[16:49:29] <Hans-Martin> robertmaxrees: ok I think I got a usable fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/jhzr54qy/
[16:49:57] <taplar> oh no, don't stick jquery in inline bindings...
[16:50:51] <Hans-Martin> taplar: that one is no problem - it was just a shortcut until I found out that functions declared in the javascript panes are not callable from inline bindings...
[16:51:21] <Hans-Martin> That's why I put the addCheckbox function into the HTML even though it's ugly that way.
[16:52:34] <Hans-Martin> Anyway my main problem is that the fieldset has an internal div with class ui-controlset-controls in it that won't be rebuilt once I destroyed it with empty().
[16:53:19] <Hans-Martin> since that div is essentially an internal artefact of jqm, I did not think that I'm supposed to handle it explicitly
[16:55:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jhzr54qy/1/
[16:57:11] <Hans-Martin> taplar: thanks for the cleanup! I really gotta get rid of my pure JS old habits...
[16:58:00] <robertmaxrees> even pure js has ways to bind listeners without using JS :)
[16:58:04] <robertmaxrees> err, using html.
[16:58:22] <taplar> so your concern is the loss of the ui-controlset-controls
[17:00:18] <taplar> is that the controlgroup widgit?
[17:03:52] <Hans-Martin> taplar: it's an internal div that is being used to remove the spacing between the controlgroup elements (after empty(), you'll not that the checkboxes have margins)
[17:05:30] <Hans-Martin> I have just looked at the dynamic controlgroup example at http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/controlgroup-dynamic again, it avoids the problem by removing  elements individually instead of calling empty(),but I don't understand the code which inserts elements at the right place...
[17:06:02] <robertmaxrees> which code?
[17:07:19] <Hans-Martin> If you look at source code, you can see the javascript used to do it. But I think I know where to look, it must be the .controlgroup("container") which returns that internal div.
[17:07:45] <Hans-Martin> (on that example page, the "View Source" button)
[17:07:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah i'm looking at it.
[17:08:12] <robertmaxrees> i was trying to figure out what specifically about that code had you confused, but it sounds like you're getting it;)
[17:08:38] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/jhzr54qy/3/
[17:09:17] <taplar> heh, the initial add more is funky.  *shrug*
[17:09:56] <z1haze_work> can you use the hover() function on a delegated event listener?
[17:10:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:10:21] <robertmaxrees> just use mouseenter and mouseleave.
[17:10:26] <z1haze_work> Im havign a weird issue with using mouseenter, mouseleave where sometimes the mouseenter action gets stuck event afer mouseout
[17:10:41] <robertmaxrees> are you doing animations?
[17:10:46] <z1haze_work> yea
[17:10:48] <z1haze_work> fadein
[17:10:51] <robertmaxrees> queueing
[17:10:56] <robertmaxrees> need to stop the previous animation.
[17:11:05] <z1haze_work> agh, so how does that work
[17:11:22] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/stop/
[17:12:11] <taplar> $('[name=love]').stop()
[17:12:58] <z1haze_work> wow thanks
[17:13:02] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:13:11] <robertmaxrees> so the basic gist is you're not firing events.
[17:13:21] <robertmaxrees> the events are always firing whether or not you're listening for them.
[17:13:31] <Hans-Martin> robertmaxrees: I was specifically confused about $( "#my-controlgroup" ).controlgroup( "container" )[ $( this ).attr( "id" ) ]( $el ); because I'm not versed in jQuery well enough to see where the action is...
[17:13:49] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work so very rarely are your bindings the issue in cases like that.
[17:13:52] <Hans-Martin> but with the .controlgroup("container") my form works now, finally!
[17:14:45] <z1haze_work> but the on mouseleave didnt even fire
[17:14:49] <z1haze_work> i dunno i mean its working now
[17:15:03] <z1haze_work> i just imagined it would always have a mouseenter event and always have a mouseleave event
[17:15:10] <robertmaxrees> right, those events always fire.
[17:15:19] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about subscribing to them :)
[17:26:51] <Hans-Martin> bye folks, thx for useful tips!
[17:35:18] <Jerrry> How do I run a jquery function after a javascript function has completed? The two functions here: http://kopy.io/CUAOw
