[07:44:19] <linux_daemon> hello everyone, i am creating a chrome extension, and i need to put the jquery.js into the manifest file, took a quick look in their documentation, but it is confusing...
[07:44:42] <linux_daemon> anyone has any idea on where should i put the jquery.js in the manifest?
[08:44:38] <Jaseinatl> I keep getting the error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'using' in top" does someone know what this means?

[19:43:08] <Northwoods> Will this work for different elements on page ?
[19:43:33] <Northwoods> Infact it is not working
[19:43:37] <Northwoods> Don't know why
[19:47:27] <Hopplahase> Not working in what way?
