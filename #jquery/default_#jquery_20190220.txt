[02:20:53] <karstenk_> Hello good morning. I have multiple buttons in a gui and want to select the last button with givven class, but all I try with .last() or :last, I get it not selected.
[02:21:09] <robertmaxrees> show us?
[02:21:11] <karstenk_> like this: jQuery('button.number-char').last().toggleClass('disabled-mode', true).prop('disabled', true);
[02:21:15] <karstenk_> isnt working
[02:21:23] <robertmaxrees> do you want to disable it?
[02:21:33] <robertmaxrees> maybe show us in a fiddle?
[02:22:45] <robertmaxrees> 'cause like.
[02:22:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mksw3L2h/
[02:23:36] <robertmaxrees> karstenk_
[02:24:28] <robertmaxrees> i have to leave in a few minutes so let me know.
[02:27:05] <robertmaxrees> lol welp
[02:28:54] <robertmaxrees> check your console and make sure you're not getting errors.  also check to make sure the last element is what you think it is.  go into your dev tools and do jQuery('button.number-char').last() - should get a little crosshair to let you see it in the inspector.  etc.
[02:28:56] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[03:26:19] <karstenk_> You example ist working and when doing jQuery('.numpad button.input-button.number-char').toggleClass('disabled-mode', true).prop('disabled', true); all elements are disabled, but when execute jQuery('.numpad button.input-button.number-char').last().toggleClass('disabled-mode', true).prop('disabled', true);   The console shows no error, but return with an element, but the expected isnt disabled
[03:27:24] <karstenk_> and jQuery return length for this selector = 1
[03:27:34] <karstenk_> so there is no second element with same selector
[03:27:40] <karstenk_> using Chrome
[03:28:04] <karstenk_> any other idea, why last() isnt working in that special context?
[03:30:20] <karstenk_> or better it is working, returns correct element, but doesnt execute anything behind last()   cant hide or give background color or anything else
[03:37:02] <Cork> karstenk_: again provide a jsfiddle
[03:45:55] <karstenk_> Cork, cause of sensible data I gave you the information in a private message
[03:46:09] <karstenk_> sry sensitive data :)
[03:46:10] <Cork> karstenk_: just replace the sensitive information
[03:46:20] <Cork> the data isn't important, the function and structure is
[03:46:28] <karstenk_> please read my message
[03:55:37] <sine`> hi folks. Imfinding it hard to understand the queue system. for example, how can i add another event to this bit of code, one that executes AFTER this one has finished. this class animates the modal transparancy down, and I want to add another class to display:none aftewards
[03:55:42] <sine`> jQuery('.pure_loader_container').delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).addClass('ld_hide'); });
[03:56:34] <sine`> do I just chain another queue event to fx?
[03:57:07] <karstenk_> .then()?
[03:57:45] <Cork> sine`: yes, just call .queue
[03:57:59] <sine`> jQuery('.pure_loader_container').delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).addClass('ld_hide'); }).delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).css('display','none'); });
[03:58:24] <Cork> also you need to unqueue as last action in the queue function
[03:58:28] <Cork> else the queue freezes
[03:59:03] <Cork> *dequeue
[03:59:12] <sine`> i thought fx does this auto
[03:59:22] <Cork> sine`: that isn't how queue works
[03:59:34] <Cork> it has nothing with what scope name you use
[03:59:50] <Cork> jquery animation fires the fx queue
[03:59:57] <Cork> then the queue unwinds
[04:00:15] <Cork> and if a step in the queue doesn't call the next step, the queue halts
[04:00:23] <Cork> sine`: read http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[04:08:47] <sine0> honestly, these free shells. did i miss anything
[04:13:04] <Cork> sine0: check the topic
[04:13:24] <sine0> jaja im on it, morning tea is brewing. im going to work it out
[04:13:36] <sine0> wasnt even dressed, thats how nerd i am
[04:13:41] <Cork> <_<'
[04:13:48] <sine0> open my eyes, computer straight on
[04:13:55] <Cork> and you find this to be needed to share cause?
[04:14:14] <sine0> im honest i cant help myself
[04:25:02] <sine0> Cork: I tried using deque but it stopped working. if you have a spare second could you please show me the appropriate syntax: https://jsfiddle.net/zxw8af6c/1/
[04:26:40] <Cork> sine0: https://jsfiddle.net/sytfhpr7/
[04:27:32] <sine0> ahh ok. so why does the first one run without deque normally
[04:27:38] <sine0> thank btw, appreciate your help
[04:27:57] <Cork> sine0: cause delay() runs dequeue('fx') and it calls your queue
[04:28:07] <Cork> and if you don't have anything after then it doesn't matter that it isn't called
[04:28:16] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/sytfhpr7/1/
[04:29:16] <Cork> sine0: so what happens is line 1 delay waits 2 seconds then calls dequeue('fx') it calls your first function
[04:29:35] <Cork> you run what you want and then call dequeue('fx') it triggers delay(2000) and so forth
[04:29:38] <sine0> so delay is linked with the queue
[04:29:46] <sine0> i didnt know they had a partnership
[04:30:09] <Cork> sine0: what makes jquery animation works is the queue/dequeue system
[04:30:27] <Cork> the fx namespace is just reserved for it
[04:30:44] <Cork> you can use any namespace you want if you don't want to interact with animation
[04:32:05] <Cork> sine0: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/queue/delay.js
[04:34:29] <sine0> ok Cork thanks. im still on the basics so will get my head around that soon
[04:39:34] <sine0> jQuery('.pure_loader_container').delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).addClass('ld_hide').dequeue('fx'); }).delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).css('display':'none').dequeue('fx'); });
[04:40:03] <sine0> Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[04:40:11] <sine0> but in the fiddle its fine
[04:41:47] <Cork> css syntaxen Ã¤r fel
[04:41:57] <Cork> opps wrong language :D
[04:42:01] <Cork> css syntax is wrong
[04:42:31] <sine0> comma
[04:42:38] <Cork> or an object
[04:42:51] <Cork> css({ display:'none' }) is valid too
[04:43:13] <Cork> though that said, i would recommend using .hide() instead
[04:43:23] <Cork> (and show() later)
[04:43:32] <Cork> that would also mean you don't need the queue
[04:44:04] <Cork> .delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).css('display':'none').dequeue('fx'); }) => .hide(2000)
[04:44:24] <Cork> oh no, that gives the wrong animation
[04:44:31] <Cork> .delay(2000).queue('fx', function() { jQuery(this).css('display':'none').dequeue('fx'); }) => delay(2000).hide()
[04:45:21] <sine0> hmm what does hide(2000) do ? :D
[04:45:46] <sine0> if it fades it out, thats just what I want!
[05:26:22] <thykka> .fadeOut() fades out
[05:39:19] <sine0> thykka: thats an animation preset in jquery i take it
[05:39:32] <Cork> sine0: have a look in api.jquery.com
[05:39:37] <Cork> what exists is listed there
[05:39:58] <sine0> cool
[05:40:26] <sine0> todate i have only been using addClass removeClass css attr
[05:40:50] <Cork> you should definitely look at switching attr for prop
[05:41:33] <sine0> noted
[05:51:32] <thykka> sine0, using classes is generally better
[07:10:09] <coderhut> hello experts, when I put my jquery related code file in footer it works but when I put it in header, it stops working. What can be the reason for that?
[07:13:56] <Cork> you're missing the ready wrapper
[07:15:14] <Cork> coderhut: http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery3
[10:21:11] <haroldjfks> hello, please, if input checked where table row contains a string...how to?
[11:07:42] <Cork> haroldjfks: are you using google translation?
[11:07:50] <Cork> cause that sentence makes no sense
[11:12:02] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess they want to check an input if the row it's in contains a substring.
[11:12:21] <haroldjfks> Cork: no, sorry, but I can better explain: select the element if an input is checked INSIDE a table row which contains a "string"
[11:12:47] <robertmaxrees> wait wat
[11:12:58] <Cork> haroldjfks: so so you want to find all rows with a checked checkbox?
[11:13:00] <robertmaxrees> show us what you've tried in a fiddle - maybe that'll explain it better.
[11:13:25] <Cork> table.find(':checked').closest('tr') would get that
[11:13:47] <Cork> but ya, a fiddle would help
[11:16:03] <haroldjfks> ok, that's solved, but another is more important: i click on a radio button and alert a message. After the alert I try to check another radio button, instead, but it doesn't work
[11:16:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle
[11:16:14] <robertmaxrees> pla
[11:21:13] <haroldjfks> ok, this http://jsfiddle.net/d6pLfzok/1/ where's wrong, please?
[11:21:30] <robertmaxrees> i mean, your code is invalid.
[11:21:42] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a quote in your alert.
[11:21:59] <robertmaxrees> also: you need names on your inputs to "group" them.
[11:22:43] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you showing them a radio they can't select?  why not just disable it?
[11:23:39] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees: yes, sorry, the quote was just an oversight... http://jsfiddle.net/d6pLfzok/2/
[11:24:34] <robertmaxrees> and my second question?
[11:25:01] <robertmaxrees> also: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1n6am920/3/
[11:25:11] <robertmaxrees> use radios the right way and it'z ezpz
[11:25:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:57:59] <haroldjfks> robertmaxrees, on the complete html page it works the first time only. So, when I load the page and click on the radio button for the 1st time it works, then the 2nd time the alert is not showing and it does nothing, the button can be selected anyway
[11:58:18] <robertmaxrees> it'd have to see it.
[11:58:41] <robertmaxrees> could be all kinds of reasons, like duplicated ID, dynamically added elements, etc.
[12:00:42] <haroldjfks> mmmm no, that's the smarty variable...inside a smarty if, it doesn't work the 2nd time because the variable can't be read again
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:01:08] <robertmaxrees> lol without seeing what's broken, can't really help :)
[12:01:16] <haroldjfks> that's a smarty 3 template
[12:01:20] <robertmaxrees> 'k.
[14:02:35] <Ownix> If I have a collection of siblings can I sort them without needing the parent container?
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> sort them how?
[14:03:25] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: By some text in a child node. Lemme jsfiddle one moment
[14:03:32] <robertmaxrees> 'kay'
[14:05:11] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/Lord_Zero/u9xjvdf5/1/
[14:05:27] <Ownix> They need to be re-ordered in-place
[14:06:02] <robertmaxrees> i'ma ask the obvious first: why are you ordering them client-side?
[14:07:06] <Ownix> APi returns JSON. The JSON is not in any particular order. The columns in the DataTable are ordered a specific way. DataTables ColVis plugin creates a button and orders the collection buttons the same way they are in the table
[14:07:15] <Ownix> To put it simply... its not something you can order server-side
[14:07:30] <robertmaxrees> i'ma save you some big headaches - sort before you render in datatables.
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> so do it as apart of the ajax call.
[14:08:05] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/I3FDHTSj/image.png
[14:08:09] <robertmaxrees> and skip doing it in the dom - you'll notice that jquery doesn't really offer a way to "sort" things.
[14:08:21] <Ownix> Well on the table it has to be one way, and in the button it has to be another
[14:08:30] <Ownix> so, it is not really possible
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:09:22] <Ownix> Alternatively, id have to introduce the colorder plugin... send all the cols down alphabetically and then let the user reorder them and use savestate to store them locally in local storage
[14:09:32] <robertmaxrees> sure
[14:09:37] <Ownix> idk. Seems like every way is going to suck.
[14:09:58] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.  to sort using jquery, you need a parent element.
[14:10:27] <robertmaxrees> you could clone the parent element and then replace the original when you're done./
[14:10:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's going to be a PITA.
[14:10:43] <robertmaxrees> i'd just grab the data and render it out in the "correct" order.
[14:11:12] <Ownix> I think i can get the parent.
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/47633187/923919
[14:11:42] <robertmaxrees> not sure if this is helpful or not./
[14:13:11] <Ownix> Unfortunately not, im using their built in colvis button. It reads the column configuration from the table.
[14:13:35] <Ownix> Source: https://github.com/DataTables/Buttons/blob/master/js/buttons.colVis.js
[14:13:51] <Ownix> Im sure you can tell ive done my homework lol even posted on DT forums but I didnt get much help.
[14:17:07] <Ownix> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/DataTables/Buttons/blob/master/js/buttons.colVis.js#L130-L136
[14:17:14] <Ownix> He does it right there actually.
[14:17:41] <robertmaxrees> yeah dunno.
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> this isn't really a datatables channel so ymmv :)
[14:20:37] <Ownix> Got it.

[16:04:23] <madprops> hi, I'm cloning something like <div id='chat_area'> ............ </div>  I need everything inside of it, excluding #chat_area" itself. So I'm doing $("#chat_area").children().clone(true, true) .. when I append that to another container it works fine. The problem is, when I do $(clone).find("*").each(function() it iterates through everything EXCEPT the immidiate children, which I need to be included, how can I iterate through it including those?
[16:05:04] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle
[16:05:06] <robertmaxrees> ? :)
[16:06:09] <robertmaxrees> alternatively - i assume you're doing var clone = $("#chat_area").children().clone(true, true)?
[16:07:52] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:10:57] <madprops> robertmaxrees, yes that's what im doing
[16:11:20] <madprops> chat_area consists of a lot of .message children , and stuff inside of them, the each loop doesn't include .message
[16:11:21] <robertmaxrees> so 2 things - 1. you don't need to do $(clone) - it's already a jquery object.
[16:11:23] <robertmaxrees> 2
[16:11:33] <robertmaxrees> just remove the .find('*'
[16:11:39] <robertmaxrees> and go right into the each.
[16:11:54] <robertmaxrees> the clone is just the children you selected earlier.
[16:12:01] <madprops> oh right. also for 1) wouldn't i need to clone it if im going to display everything from some place into another container, including click events?
[16:12:12] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[16:12:25] <robertmaxrees> you should be using delegated listeners in that case.,
[16:12:33] <madprops> im cloning the inside of #chat_area into #chat_search_container
[16:12:41] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[16:12:50] <madprops> delegated listeners would be complex
[16:12:58] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:13:03] <robertmaxrees> they're much easier heh
[16:13:06] <robertmaxrees> but okie
[16:13:07] <madprops> since there's a lot of functionality in there
[16:13:21] <madprops> but thank you, i need to remove find("*")
[16:13:35] <robertmaxrees> and remove the extra $() call
[16:13:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:15:01] <madprops> robertmaxrees, there's a problem, .each() will only loop through immidiate .message elements now
[16:15:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:15:15] <madprops> i need to loop through all of them to remove ids
[16:15:17] <robertmaxrees> what do you need the .each() for?
[16:15:24] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[16:15:30] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to do 2 eaches then.
[16:15:35] <madprops> though actually that might not be necessary
[16:15:39] <robertmaxrees> one for the parents, one for the descendents.
[16:15:50] <robertmaxrees> if you have any ids in there, it's necessary.
[16:16:44] <madprops> yeah but i think only .message elements have an id
[16:16:45] <madprops> im checking
[16:18:55] <madprops> would be nice if .clone could have an option to clone everything without ids
[16:19:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:19:12] <madprops> also is there not an equivalent to .classList ?
[16:19:15] <madprops> that worried me
[16:19:47] <robertmaxrees> this is why you don't use jquery for jobs like this.
[16:19:53] <robertmaxrees> and it has .prop('class')
[16:20:38] <madprops> oh right, it's just that i just saw a stackoverflow question and using native classList was suggested
[16:20:46] <robertmaxrees> that's another option.
[16:20:56] <robertmaxrees> but generally you don't need classList so
[16:20:59] <robertmaxrees> y'know
[16:22:13] <madprops> yeah
[16:22:16] <madprops> hmm weird
[16:22:19] <madprops> im doing 			if(!included)
[16:22:19] <madprops> 			{
[16:22:19] <madprops> 				$(this).remove()
[16:22:19] <madprops> 			}
[16:22:29] <madprops> inside the each loop
[16:22:32] <madprops> doesn't seem to remove the element
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> please don't paste code in the channel :/
[16:22:36] <robertmaxrees> and make a fiddle?
[16:22:44] <madprops> 3 lines .. so y'know
[16:22:50] <robertmaxrees> 4
[16:22:52] <robertmaxrees> and it's annoying :)
[16:22:58] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be great though!
[16:23:06] <robertmaxrees> that was i can see what you're doing in context.
[16:23:12] <madprops> https://paste.ee/p/aiTQE
[16:24:29] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:24:50] <robertmaxrees> why not use Array.prototype.some ?
[16:25:04] <madprops> don't know what that is
[16:25:20] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[16:25:51] <robertmaxrees> if (!words.some(word => return text.includes(word)) { console.log('win'); }
[16:26:47] <madprops> idk but that seems more complicated
[16:26:57] <madprops> wait no
[16:27:10] <madprops> it would make the included var not necessary
[16:27:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:27:49] <robertmaxrees> and is semantically much closer to what you want.
[16:29:49] <robertmaxrees> ah wait you don't need the return there: if (!words.some(word => text.includes(word)) { console.log('win'); }
[16:32:18] <madprops> ok im doing it that way now
[16:32:24] <madprops> it triggers 132 removes
[16:32:29] <madprops> but the items are still there
[16:32:33] <madprops> must be doing something dumb
[16:32:44] <robertmaxrees> yeah, would need a fiddle at this point.
[16:32:52] <madprops> there are 140 .message
[16:33:23] <madprops> making a fiddle would be complicated ... but here's the full function https://paste.ee/p/kPTTU
[16:34:29] <robertmaxrees> without markup, etc, it's hard to help.  sorry!
[16:37:11] <madprops> i guess the clone doesn't have a .remove method if it's not in the dom yet
[16:37:23] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:37:42] <robertmaxrees> it IS in the dem heh.
[16:38:15] <madprops> it's not appended to anything when i do the each loop though
[16:38:24] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter.
[16:39:14] <robertmaxrees> let me make a test case.
[16:41:18] <robertmaxrees> ah derp - just use filter.
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vLg61dub/4/
[16:42:20] <robertmaxrees> you can pass a function to filter, too.
[16:42:35] <madprops> hmmm nice, gonna try it
[16:42:45] <robertmaxrees> filter(function() { return $(this).hasClass('keeme) });
[16:44:18] <madprops> this worked! https://paste.ee/p/p5iGZ
[16:44:28] <madprops> only issue is i have to make an extra loop to remove ids
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> $(clone).appendTo("#chat_search_container") - remove the $() btw.
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> it's already a jquery object.
[16:45:32] <madprops> right
[16:47:36] <madprops> thank you robert
[17:59:36] <sine`> so I have this button which I only watch for on the ID #blah for a click event. everyone is clicking it about 4 times and im getting multiple submissions, so I guess I need to disable for a short while upon click, amirite
[18:01:49] <robertmaxrees> sine` uh, depends?  what is the button for?
[18:02:15] <sine`> button is not inside of form its just a regular button where jquery watches it so maybe this wont work ?
[18:02:18] <sine`> $("#btnSubmit").attr("disabled", true)
[18:02:26] <robertmaxrees> you can do that.
[18:02:38] <sine`> and that will stop the jquery picking up on the click event
[18:02:38] <robertmaxrees> use prop tho
[18:02:47] <sine`> $("#btnSubmit").prop("disabled", true)
[18:03:05] <robertmaxrees> have you tried? :)
[18:03:13] <sine`> im going to do it now
[18:03:48] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/w8nxku90/
[18:03:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[18:04:16] <sine`> can I chain it with this: $("#btnSubmit").prop("disabled", true).delay(2000).prop("disabled", false)
[18:04:27] <robertmaxrees> no.
