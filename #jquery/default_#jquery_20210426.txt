[00:00:13] <robertmaxrees> hdalang something like https://jsfiddle.net/2w3c978g/
[00:01:00] <robertmaxrees> also that window resize is strange - sounds like you need to work with your layout some more since you shouldn't be adding/removing classes when working with a responsive css framework.
[10:21:46] <robertparkerx> how do you .find second instance of <span>
[10:22:03] <robertparkerx> I tried .find("span:nth-child(2)")
[10:24:22] <robertparkerx> I got it
[10:24:26] <robertparkerx> I can use :last
[10:24:40] <robertparkerx> since there are only 2
[11:01:42] <pavonia> span:nth-of-type(2)
[12:04:49] <robertparkerx> ty
[14:12:07] <ecommence> Do you guys find fullscreen mobile menus to be more usable and pleasing than the ones that slide in halfway from the side?
[14:12:57] <robertmaxrees> so long as i can reach it with my thumb, i don't really care how it's implemented
[14:14:27] <ecommence> hmm
[14:15:42] <ecommence> so they're roughly equally usable. the side slider breaks up the layout though, often with its tinted layer. with fullscreen i guess you're free from that
[14:16:12] <robertmaxrees> "breaks up the layout"?
[14:31:06] <ecommence> yeah they usually only go to 70% width, leaving a dark void on the screen
[14:32:26] <robertmaxrees> never heard that referred to as "breaking up the layout" haha
[14:59:22] <ecommence> breaking the flow then :D
[15:00:48] <ecommence> robertmaxrees: thanks for recommending swiperjs.com the other day
[15:00:56] <ecommence> its really nice
[15:03:41] <robertmaxrees> haha if you're worried about usability, carousels are a great thing to ditch :)
[15:05:35] <robertmaxrees> hrm, looking back through the logs i don't think i suggested that.
[23:11:59] <hawjeh> hi, may i ask if jQuery has any end of support documentation?
[23:12:48] <robertmaxrees> hawjeh mind clarifying?
[23:13:47] <hawjeh> something like this -> https://endoflife.date/bootstrap
[23:13:48] <hawjeh> my client asking to justify end of support of software / library
[23:14:15] <hawjeh> I wonder jquery has it..
[23:14:43] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of.
[23:15:17] <hawjeh> robertmaxrees thanks :)
[23:17:10] <robertmaxrees> though not sure waht you mean by "justify end of support" - that particular page doesn't justify anything.  just tells you that particular project's EoL per version.
