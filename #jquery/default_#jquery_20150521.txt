[00:00:05] <Woet> pauled: okay, jQuery edge is a nightly build and it's causing that error.
[00:00:05] <pauled> what is edge difference between jquery?
[00:00:13] <Woet> pauled: use 2.1.3 instead
[00:00:16] <pauled> ah thanks
[00:00:16] <Woet> pauled: why do you even need firebug?
[00:01:06] <pauled> to see the output console because the console of chrome don't sticky on the jsfiddle frame
[00:01:21] <Woet> pauled: works fine here. but you can add firebug using "external resources" if you insist
[00:02:28] <pauled> ah thanks :) look it works
[00:03:19] <pauled> How I can optimise the code here? there is other way to code this?
[00:07:17] <Cork> pauled: to start with i would add the number as a data-rating="" attribute
[00:07:28] <Cork> so you don't have to regex fiddle with the content
[00:07:38] <Cork> that is more stability the optimize
[00:08:22] <Cork> pauled: additionally, the selectors seams over specific
[00:08:36] <pauled> where you see data-rating?
[00:08:48] <Cork> i don't i said "add"
[00:10:02] <pauled> I don't understand, how I can retrieve rating? there is no data-rating attribute, and I don't control the serverside
[00:10:12] <Cork> ah
[00:10:19] <Cork> didn't know the later part
[00:10:27] <pauled> yeah sorry :)
[00:10:36] <pauled> it's an userscript
[00:10:50] <pauled> tampermonkey script
[00:12:01] <pauled> I want to trigger clic on berserk button if the difference is superior to MyValue
[00:12:19] <Cork> pauled: how about http://jsfiddle.net/wn21zm68/10/
[00:14:26] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wn21zm68/11/ is another option
[00:15:12] <Cork> /11/ might be the better option
[00:15:19] <Cork> it's the most robust selector
[00:16:12] <pauled> thanks I am looking the code :)
[00:17:08] <pauled> ah, the second I can't because MyRating can be .white or .black
[00:18:05] <pauled> MyRating is always the second <a />
[00:18:25] <Cork> pauled: could you select based on the href then?
[00:18:31] <pauled> it can be something white or black on a chessboard
[00:18:54] <pauled> no href change too
[00:20:14] <stangeland> hi...anybody knows how to make an autocompletion list for cities without having a database of city names? Does google have some sort of API i can use to create city autocompletion or somebody else?
[00:20:15] <Cork> so the content of the href is just random junk?
[00:20:32] <pauled> yeah
[00:20:36] <Cork> lovely
[00:20:42] <Cork> well /10/ then i guess
[00:20:56] <pauled> yeah 10 is clean
[00:21:12] <Cork> no it is very far from clean
[00:21:23] <Cork> but it's about as go...
[00:21:27] <Cork> uh
[00:21:28] <pauled> I mean is good :)
[00:21:28] <Cork> lol
[00:21:56] <Cork> pauled: http://jsfiddle.net/wn21zm68/13/
[00:22:06] <Cork> hard to beat that one :)
[00:22:38] <Cork> you could even automate it >_>
[00:24:07] <pauled> automate?
[00:24:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wn21zm68/14/
[00:25:01] <Cork> opps one min
[00:25:11] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/wn21zm68/15/
[00:26:44] <pauled> wow, let me check :)
[00:28:20] <pauled> wow what is this magic :)
[00:28:46] <Cork> pauled: the selector gabs both links
[00:28:59] <Cork> map runs the regex on each element (so you get the string)
[00:29:33] <Cork> then reduce loops the resulting array and reduces the values down to a single value though the current-value - previous-value function
[00:29:40] <Cork> and you're left with the difference
[00:30:18] <pauled> p for previous? then it's the first link ?
[00:30:27] <Cork> yes
[00:31:01] <pauled> I mean p is HisRating and c MyRating?
[00:31:20] <pauled> I got it
[00:31:39] <Cork> you could name them if you prefer :)
[00:31:49] <pauled> yeah :)
[00:32:36] <Cork> this only works as long as there isn't more then two user links though
[00:32:49] <Cork> but as you're working with chess...
[00:33:35] <pauled> I have to check if there is no more link when berserk button is available.
[00:47:38] <pauled> Cork: I made a jsperf test case http://jsperf.com/berserk
[00:49:57] <pauled> .eq() is much faster than my first attempt
[00:50:13] <Cork> ya, cause no use of >
[00:50:45] <Cork> and it only makes one fairly fast selection
[00:51:33] <Cork> was a bit surprised that the map.reduce cost as much as it did
[00:52:13] <pauled> yeah, I am thinking to add testcase with reduce but not map
[00:53:14] <Cork> though that said, it is more about manageability here then speed
[00:53:29] <Cork> cause none of these are really a performance problem
[00:53:36] <pauled> true
[00:54:16] <Cork> any of the solutions that didn't relay on a long chaing of direct decedent selectors is fine
[01:20:00] <pyCasso> anyone around?
[01:20:32] <Kartagis> I am
[01:44:32] <pauled> Cork: I made a jsperf test case of variable vs function. http://jsperf.com/variable-vs-function I don't get it why function is ~20% much faster
[01:46:11] <Cork> pauled: it isn't for me
[01:46:52] <pauled> hmm strange, I get 23% faster +/-2%
[01:47:07] <Cork> pauled: the speed differences are in the noise here
[01:47:43] <Cork> firefox variable: 44,899 func: 42,427
[01:47:44] <Justus> pauled: same here, variable +-1.19 with 5499 vs function +-3.07 with 5391
[01:48:05] <Cork> chrome: var: 42,680 func: 37,859
[01:48:26] <pauled> I am on chrome
[01:48:29] <Cork> but the +- is 6% so...
[01:48:38] <Cork> so it is all just noice
[01:48:44] <Cork> *noise
[01:50:48] <pauled> hmm right, I just tested a 3rd time and I get something in roughly equal.
[01:51:20] <Justus> if you really want to know what happens you need more runs
[01:51:30] <Justus> although you probably don't need to know what happens
[01:51:59] <Justus> I'd expect the regular expression to be the slow part anyway
[01:53:00] <Cork> not really that expression is simple
[01:53:13] <Cork> and that is why you get so much variations
[01:53:21] <pauled> I guess my two attempt test was biased because cache of wrong code calling the function as variable
[01:53:33] <Cork> cause what you test has so small impact on performance
[01:54:03] <Cork> pauled: are you doing this for fun or are you actually trying to optimize the hell out of this?
[01:54:15] <Cork> cause if you are then you are square in the premature optimization field
[01:54:34] <pauled> no, just trying to understand the benefit of function
[01:55:26] <Justus> huh?
[01:55:28] <Cork> functions can create a local variable scope so if you grab lots of values through parent scopes you can get a small speed up
[01:55:38] <Cork> but at the same time functions create a scope
[01:55:39] <pauled> I don't understand if I need to use function here
[01:55:45] <Justus> you don't
[01:55:46] <Cork> there isn't one
[01:56:34] <Cork> pauled: we're talking saving single digit cycles here
[01:56:52] <Cork> for performance that you're fiddling with has close to no impact
[01:57:29] <Justus> I'm not even sure we are, I'd expect a function to always impact performance at best neutral
[01:57:37] <Justus> as compared to linear code that is
[01:57:40] <Cork> hack that you select the element in each iteration is several times the performance hit then the rest of the things you're doing
[01:58:04] <Cork> Justus: its very hard to say one way or the other, as it is very engine dependent
[01:58:25] <Cork> if you manage to hit ones optimized path you get a slight speed up
[01:58:38] <Cork> but quite likely misses someones else speed path so a loss there
[01:59:00] <Cork> but again this would only matter if you did something very heavy in a big loop
[01:59:18] <Cork> it has close to no impact in this context
[01:59:25] <Justus> yeah, basically that would be engine specific optimisation, I have yet to encounter a problem that would require that
[01:59:54] <Cork> there are, if you write something like a big fps engine or something
[02:00:00] <pauled> if my test was not biased by the cache of a wrong previous code (calling: if (diff >= MyValue instead of if diff(HisRating, MyRating) >= MyValue), I would not talk about that here.
[02:00:09] <Justus> which explains why I haven't met it yet, I don't do games ;)
[02:00:36] <Cork> pauled: jit will inline that function anyway
[02:00:55] <Cork> so it will have extremely small effect
[02:03:18] <pauled> Cork: but my userscript run in addition to a site that use a lot of jquery and xhr
[02:04:03] <Cork> pauled: adding more complext code that the parser have to jit will hit performance more then you can optimize this simple code
[02:04:13] <pauled> and jsperf is a good start to check if my script can slowdown my session
[02:04:23] <Cork> ah, not really
[02:04:42] <Cork> as it is simulating a none related environment
[02:06:17] <pauled> performance is important to me because not fps but the lag on chessboard
[02:06:47] <Cork> your missing the point
[02:06:50] <pauled> there can be lag between each move
[02:06:52] <Cork> you won't find performance here
[02:07:08] <Cork> pauled: if performance is that important use vanilla js
[02:07:25] <Cork> cache the selectors so you don't select them over and over again
[02:07:42] <Cork> store the regex in a variable so it isn't parsed over and over again
[02:08:03] <pauled> what you mean by 'cache' variable?
[02:08:04] <Cork> optimizing arthritic with a function for performance is... silly
[02:08:16] <Cork> pauled: $()
[02:08:23] <Cork> run that once on page load and reuse
[02:08:41] <Cork> that will affect performance several times over compared to what your optimizing
[02:09:09] <pauled> that what I do in the first link?
[02:09:25] <pauled> hmm I don't understand
[02:09:33] <pauled> I am confused
[02:11:46] <Cork> pauled: if what you have there is the full context
[02:11:54] <Cork> and this just runs straight on page load
[02:12:08] <Cork> then ya, what you're doing is completely pointless and just won't affect anything
[02:12:25] <Cork> make sure you clear up the variables after you're done and the rest won't affect anytning
[02:13:02] <Cork> if you save say 5ms in script run time it won't even cause a single missed frame
[02:13:54] <pauled> please can you show me in this http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/wn21zm68/ how I can cache selector and clear variables after if statement ?
[02:14:57] <Cork> pauled: there isn't anything to cache
[02:15:05] <Cork> it runs once not 5000 times
[02:16:22] <Cork> the performance you can even dream to squeeze out of this will be so tiny you won't even be able to sense it much less see it
[02:17:03] <pauled> I am just trying to understand what you mean by cache
[02:17:25] <Cork> pauled: if the jspref page showed say 400 rounds instead of 44000 you might have had a case
[02:17:30] <Cork> but... this is just silly
[02:17:45] <Cork> pauled: there is nothing to cache cause there is no repetition
[02:17:57] <Cork> cache is to make repeated work faster
[02:18:06] <Cork> but as there isn't any there isn't anything to cache
[02:18:26] <freezevee> Can anyone please help ? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30367983/manipulate-rails-datetime-fields-with-datetimepicker-and-javascript
[02:19:04] <pauled> thanks cork for the lightning :)
[02:23:34] <Bheam> how come .css('perspective','900px') does transform: perspective(900px)? This doesn't work in IE
[02:23:47] <Tennis> Hey guiz , I googled "dynamically added <li> on click event no applied" and the chorus rang in that I should be using .live() but then the google results for that said use .on but i'm already using .on and it doesnt work
[02:23:56] <Cork> Bheam: cause there isn't any css property perspective
[02:24:04] <Cork> its transform with the value perspective
[02:24:25] <Bheam> not true for ie
[02:24:31] <Bheam> nothing happens with that set
[02:24:33] <Cork>  .css('transform','perspective(900px)')
[02:24:36] <pauled> Cork: what freezevee is looking is not reduce() ?
[02:24:45] <Cork> Bheam: ie uses -ms-transform i think
[02:25:00] <freezevee> pauled: why ?
[02:25:03] <Bheam> point being jquery doesn't work for setting perspective?
[02:25:20] <Cork> Bheam: point is your trying to change something that doesn't exist
[02:25:33] <Bheam> stop arguing, i'm telling you there's a bug
[02:25:36] <Cork> it isn't jquerys fault
[02:25:39] <Cork> ...
[02:25:41] <Cork> no there isn't
[02:26:02] <Cork> you can say 1+1=3 as much as you like it won't make it true
[02:26:05] <pauled> freezevee: hmmm sorry I perhaps misunderstood your issue
[02:26:13] <Bheam> yes there is. in your opinion, jquery corrects the invalid css i set, the end result is, however, that the so called valid css doesn't work in IE
[02:26:29] <Cork> Bheam: 1. jqeury doesn't handle prefixes
[02:26:46] <Bheam> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/perspective
[02:26:50] <Cork> 2. you set transform something that isn't a standard property in most browsers
[02:27:22] <Bheam> .css('perspective', '900px') is valid
[02:27:28] <Cork> no it isn't...
[02:27:35] * Cork stops arguing
[02:28:11] <Bheam> what's with mozilla and half the internet claiming it is then?
[02:28:12] <Cork> but read up on you're facts before arguing something
[02:28:24] <Cork> Bheam: mozilla isn't claiming it
[02:28:35] <Cork> you're just not reading through the compatibility info
[02:28:53] <Bheam> what part am i missing?
[02:28:56] <pauled> .css('perspective', '900px') is equal to style="perspective:900px"
[02:29:10] <Bheam> yes, but jquery rewrites it to transform: perspective(900px)
[02:29:17] <Cork> no
[02:29:28] <Bheam> it does for me
[02:29:38] <Cork> then you have a plugin that does that
[02:29:58] <Bheam> unlikely, i'll get a new version of jquery tho
[02:30:58] <arc_> gotta say the results of this do not look good lol
[02:33:01] <BrazenBraden> has anyone come across a strange thing where you ajax load in some content at the top of the page and the browser scroll jumps to the middle of the page for no reason?
[02:33:53] <Cork> BrazenBraden: me guessing you aren't prepending the data
[02:34:10] <Cork> and instead serialize the content to html and then concat the content in and add it all to the page again
[02:34:22] <Cork> that causes the content height to jump and can cause the scroll to change
[02:35:58] <BrazenBraden> Cork hmm ok, but would it always jump to exactly the middle of the page? (its a long page) (i have tested on different resolution monitors.. always the middle)
[02:36:12] <BrazenBraden> and it only happens on this one page. no other page jumps
[02:36:45] <Cork> BrazenBraden: it jumps by how much shorter the page gets the the max scroll as the content length temporarly changes
[02:37:00] <Cork> *then the max scroll*
[02:37:47] <BrazenBraden> Cork I see. and out of curiosity, would one be able to disable scroll and then re-enable it after the load has completed?
[02:37:58] <Cork> no
[02:38:06] <azx> is there a way to filter specific elements with a filter in jquery instead of adding IDs? (1st 2nd 3rd 4th etc)
[02:38:10] <Cork> scrollTop can't ever be larger then max scroll
[02:38:22] <azx> i know :first and :last
[02:38:30] <Cork> the value is invalid and caped to the max value it can have
[02:38:42] <Cork> BrazenBraden: a simple solution is to add the new content before you remove the old
[02:38:48] <Cork> so the page first gets longer
[02:38:51] <Cork> and then same height
[02:38:59] <Cork> instead of shorter then same height
[02:39:28] <Tennis> I worked it out just put a few more parameters in the .on()
[02:39:42] <Tennis> $("#dropdownconsultants").on("click", "li", function(){
[02:40:05] <Cork> azx: there is also .eq
[02:40:08] <BrazenBraden> Cork, hmm ok..
[02:41:08] <Cork> BrazenBraden: an option would be to store the old scroll position and then restore it
[02:41:21] <Cork> but that has a risk of getting buggy
[02:42:29] <BrazenBraden> Cork ok.. mind if I show you the code I think is responsible for it? Maybe you could point out where you think its doing this (i might have an idea but not sure)
[02:42:59] <Cork> make a fiddle and i can have a look (or someone else)
[02:43:09] <BrazenBraden> fiddle. ok, gotchya
[02:44:00] <BrazenBraden> but.. how will the fiddle work as im ajaxing crap from my app?
[02:44:27] <Cork> there is an ajax api
[02:44:34] <Cork> but you don't have to make the code running
[02:44:39] <BrazenBraden> hmm ok
[02:45:00] <Cork> just the jquery code will make it clear what happens here
[02:45:15] <Cork> (as ajax isn't really part of the problem)
[02:46:08] <BrazenBraden> gosh, I dont know how to put this all into a fiddle.. there are just so many parts all over the place
[02:46:28] <BrazenBraden> and it looks ugly as poo
[02:46:51] <Cork> BrazenBraden: what you need is the part that actually takes the new content and adds it to the page
[02:46:57] <Cork> and what ever removes old content
[02:47:06] <BrazenBraden> well, that should be in here then:  https://jsfiddle.net/9fcbvkz8/
[02:47:14] <Cork> the rest is fairly uninsteresting
[02:47:38] <BrazenBraden> Im assuming its due to the order in the function at the end 'animate_containerSwap'
[02:47:47] <Uhkis> is there an event when iframe changes page?
[02:48:06] <Uhkis> like when clicking a link
[02:48:19] <Cork> BrazenBraden: ya
[02:48:40] <Cork> BrazenBraden: the problem is the .slideUp in there
[02:48:50] <BrazenBraden> Cork so slideDown first then SlideUp?
[02:48:50] <Cork> an option is to add a wrapper around the element
[02:48:59] <BrazenBraden> ok?
[02:49:04] <Cork> give it a max-height that is equal to the c1 element
[02:49:11] <Cork> slide the element up
[02:49:15] <Cork> and then up the new
[02:49:22] <Cork> and lastly remove the max-height
[02:49:24] <Cork> opps
[02:49:28] <Cork> i meant min-height
[02:49:38] <BrazenBraden> hmm ok, will try do that quick
[02:49:48] <Cork> that way you won't lose page height
[02:49:57] <Cork> it might not look the way you want though
[02:50:25] <Cork> another option is to set body min-height == body height
[02:50:42] <Cork> that might actually be the cleanest solution
[02:50:55] <Cork> Uhkis: the load event
[02:51:17] <Cork> it won't explicitly indicate what url is shown though if i remember correctly
[02:51:23] <BrazenBraden> Cork, set the body min-height before doing the swap? Them after swap, remove the min height?
[02:51:41] <Cork> BrazenBraden: yup
[02:51:47] <Uhkis> Cork: thanks!
[02:51:59] <BrazenBraden> Cork, cool, will give that a shot
[03:01:49] <BrazenBraden> Cork, alas, no cigar.. am I setting the min-height wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/9fcbvkz8/1/
[03:02:40] <Cork> yes
[03:02:52] <Cork> or rather it used to be wrong, but apparently not anymore
[03:03:01] <BrazenBraden> Cork oh?
[03:03:13] <Cork> give me a min
[03:03:35] <BrazenBraden> take as many as you want :)
[03:09:44] <Cork> BrazenBraden: https://jsfiddle.net/9fcbvkz8/2/
[03:10:08] <Cork> ah
[03:10:09] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/9fcbvkz8/3/
[03:10:13] <Cork> the + 'px' isn'
[03:10:16] <Cork> *'t needed
[03:10:36] <BrazenBraden> Cork okie will give this a shot. thanks :)
[03:11:01] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/9fcbvkz8/4/ and a version with a little less extream changes
[03:11:16] <Cork> where you see that the scroll position stays at the old position
[03:14:48] <BrazenBraden> Cork, hmm, alas, fat lady still hasnt sung.. when I click the button, it hops to the very bottom of the page and when the swap happens, I see the footer bar slide up and down on the screen
[03:15:38] <Cork> BrazenBraden: try adding the + 'px' to the .css min-height value
[03:15:47] <Cork> cause older jquery versions didn't add that
[03:17:31] <BrazenBraden> Cork, ok, but I am using jQuery 2.1.4
[03:17:58] <Cork> BrazenBraden: comment out the code that does the animation
[03:18:02] <Cork> and make sure the max height is set
[03:18:09] <Cork> and is actually >= current body height
[03:18:33] <BrazenBraden> my body height before the swap is 4631
[03:19:09] <Cork> and if you inspect the body element you get a min-height: 4631px or similar value?
[03:21:10] <suexec> if($(element).has("li").length) { .. } <- Should that be valid code, as long as element is a valid dom element ?
[03:21:33] <BrazenBraden> Cork when I watch inspect element on button click, the min-height is applied. interestingly, first time clicking it (currently with new view in c1), doc height is 4631. after click, height is 4128 (that loads the edit view). clicking cancel on edit view (which loads the new view again), doc height is 3569
[03:22:19] <Cork> suexec: yes, though it would prob recommend using .find instead
[03:22:30] <Cork> suexec: your doing more work then needed right now
[03:23:09] <Cork> BrazenBraden: ok so the body height changes
[03:23:26] <Cork> that is pretty much expected to affect the scroll then
[03:23:40] <BrazenBraden> apparently so. but its stabalizes on the second 2 values (depending on the new or edit view)
[04:03:07] <noodles_ftw> hi
[04:03:09] <noodles_ftw> anyone here?
[04:12:21] <kokut> Hello, how can i trigger a click event ?
[04:12:53] <noodles_ftw> kokut: $(element).click()
[04:13:01] <kokut> noodles_ftw: doesnt work
[04:13:27] <noodles_ftw> kokut: need to see your code then
[04:14:59] <kokut> noodles_ftw: i'm gonna try with jquery.simulate
[04:16:52] <Uhkis> does $(element).trigger('click'); work?
[04:17:12] <Cork> element.click and elemetn.trigger('click') is the same thing
[04:17:26] <Cork> though note you can't fake a default click action on a link
[04:17:31] <Cork> if that is what you're trying to do
[04:27:53] <lintguy> Cork: !
[04:28:01] <lintguy> Just the man i was looking for
[04:28:06] <Cork> ?_?
[04:28:09] <lintguy> (Or woman but i doubt it)
[04:28:36] <lintguy> Cork: How large would you say and admin editor would be allowed to be? In JS only.
[04:28:56] <lintguy> That's with wysiwyg and file and image uploads plus file manager.
[04:28:56] <Cork> huh?
[04:29:01] <Cork> "admin editor"?
[04:29:09] <lintguy> Cork: Yeah, or admin interface.
[04:29:14] <lintguy> How large would be too large?
[04:29:27] <Cork> does it matter if it is just an admin interface?
[04:29:42] <Cork> as long as it is only loaded when needed that is
[04:29:43] <lintguy> Well, mine is 1.3MB and the client is complaining about the loading time.
[04:29:56] <lintguy> Only loaded once and cached.
[04:29:57] <Cork> heh ya
[04:30:04] <Cork> that IS quite a bit though
[04:30:13] <Cork> just executing that would most likely take a while
[04:30:30] <lintguy> On my oldish laptop it takes 2 seconds
[04:30:47] <lintguy> I mean, it's not a website
[04:31:58] <Cork> lintguy: my complete javascript folder for my current project (with commends unminified for all pages) is 820k
[04:32:45] <Cork> so ya 1.3 for a single interface sounds a bit hefty
[04:34:47] <lintguy> Cork: That's the whole folder here as well, it contains jquery, semantic-ui, jsoneditor,swiper,dropzone, interactjs,froala-wysiwyg + plugins and then the script to tie it all together.
[04:35:07] <Cork> lintguy: minified?
[04:35:11] <lintguy> Yes
[04:35:37] <Cork> well time to look into slimming it down then
[04:36:07] <lintguy> I guess i could remove quite a lot of components from semantic-ui, it's 400kb minified
[04:37:27] <lintguy> Cork: But I think keeping it under 1MB would be considered good for a full admin ui right?
[04:38:06] <Cork> that would depend on the situation
[04:38:23] <lintguy> Of course
[04:38:34] <Cork> lintguy: are you sure it is the js size that is causing the load time?
[04:38:39] <lintguy> I know they have slow internet right now
[04:38:43] <lintguy> I mean like, modem slow...
[04:38:48] <Cork> it could just as well be slow js codes
[04:39:02] <lintguy> execution time is 200ms
[04:39:10] <lintguy> so don't seem like it
[04:39:19] <Cork> oook, then ya 1mb js won't work with that kind of connection
[04:39:38] <Cork> you will have to get closer to like 300k
[04:39:45] <lintguy> Cork: if i cache the framework harder then it would only need to load once
[04:39:59] <Cork> see if gzip the traffic can help you
[04:40:11] <lintguy> gzip is turned on
[04:40:20] <Cork> lintguy: unless the devices have small caches
[04:40:33] <Cork> so the js blob gets throws out all the time
[04:40:41] <Cork> *thrown
[04:43:36] <lintguy> Cork: Nevermind… I just asked what browser they tested with.
[04:43:43] <lintguy> Cork: Guess 10 times which one
[04:43:49] <Cork> ie6?
[04:43:56] <lintguy> IE8 on XP
[04:44:11] <Cork> well at least it isn't ie7
[04:44:18] <lintguy> They also tested on IE9 with W7
[04:44:19] <Cork> the slowest browser ever created
[04:44:42] <lintguy> Yeah, one can take a break while waiting for JS to load on that..
[04:45:12] <lintguy> So, now they tried with Chrome and it took about 2 seconds
[04:45:16] <lintguy> Geesh...
[04:45:21] <Cork> :)
[04:45:35] <lintguy> How can anyone even browser the internet using IE8 or 9
[04:45:38] <Cork> testing with ie11 should have works too
[04:45:38] <lintguy> I don't get it
[04:45:53] <lintguy> I tested it with IE10 and 11 myself and those are fast too
[04:45:54] <Cork> ya, pre ie10 is quite bad
[04:46:01] <Cork> pre ie9 is horrible
[04:46:10] <lintguy> Yeah….
[04:46:23] <lintguy> Well, thanks for you input as always Cork :)
[04:46:34] <Cork> heh didn't do much :)
[04:46:50] <lintguy> It's the thought that matters ;)
[04:47:36] <lintguy> Cork: May i ask what you work with?
[04:47:44] <Cork> guess :)
[04:47:56] <Cork> i work for a hosting company
[04:48:01] <lintguy> Rackspace?
[04:48:03] <Cork> developing the administration interface
[04:48:05] <Cork> no
[04:48:11] <lintguy> Uh...
[04:48:18] <Cork> and service provisioning
[04:48:23] <Cork> and system automation :)
[04:48:27] <lintguy> There are thousands to guess on
[04:48:29] <lintguy> Amazon?
[04:48:39] <Cork> so the full stack from html down to go and bash
[04:48:52] <Cork> no it is a swedish company directed at consultants
[04:49:06] <Cork> so ppl normally don't buy directly from us
[04:49:08] <lintguy> Oh, i think i can guess now
[04:49:12] <lintguy> Eh… wait
[04:51:04] <lintguy> IP Only?
[04:51:41] <Cork> heh you most guaranteed haven't heard of us
[04:51:48] <lintguy> :-(
[04:51:54] <lintguy> So who is it?
[04:51:55] <Cork> http://ilait.com/
[04:52:38] <lintguy> Whoa, kind of outdates site there buddy
[04:52:43] <lintguy> outdated*
[04:52:54] <Cork> ya, haven't touched it for a long time
[04:53:00] <lintguy> How come?
[04:53:19] <Cork> small team busy with other areas :)
[04:53:45] <lintguy> Seems to be at least 11 people, no webdesigner?
[04:54:29] <Cork> no comment :)
[04:54:33] <Cork> not sure i'm allowed
[04:55:03] <lintguy> Ok, so you are swedish?
[05:06:16] <lintguy> Cork: Did i scare you away?
[05:07:07] <Cork> heh, no but i have a work to do too :)
[05:07:19] <lintguy> Cork: Yeah, i messaged you about that
[05:07:26] <hassoon> swedish people are famous in software dev generally
[05:07:27] <lintguy> Maybe you have that turned off
[05:07:28] <hassoon> cool
[05:07:46] <Cork> check your status window
[05:07:49] <Cork> * lintguy ~Adium@unaffiliated/lintguy :is messaging you, and you have umode +g.
[05:08:31] <lintguy> Yeah, i saw that, so you have it on ignore mode?
[05:08:49] <lintguy> is in +g mode (server-side ignore.)
[05:09:01] <Cork> i have it in supress mp mode ya
[05:09:06] <Cork> *pm
[05:09:23] <Cork> cause it is a nice way to get rid of all the spam bots on freenode
[05:09:23] <circ-user-EZ9cg> could i have some help please :>?
[05:09:33] <Cork> ?asj @ circ-user-EZ9cg
[05:09:36] <Cork> ...
[05:09:36] <lintguy> Ah, ok, so how to can we talk privately?
[05:09:38] <Cork> ?ask @ circ-user-EZ9cg
[05:10:11] <Cork> lintguy: contact me in a channel and give me a good case for what it would be needed
[05:10:23] <lintguy> I've never had issues with spambots on freenode though
[05:10:39] <circ-user-EZ9cg> i'm new to irc so whats ?ask ?
[05:10:44] <lintguy> Cork: I'm interested in your companies services
[05:11:00] <Cork> circ-user-EZ9cg: sight, it is the sign that the bot is dead :)
[05:11:03] <lintguy> Cork: I do full stack myself in my small swedish company, but am looking for a partner.
[05:11:08] <Cork> circ-user-EZ9cg: don't ask to ask, just ask the question
[05:11:26] <Cork> lintguy: i'm quite happy where i am :)
[05:11:49] <lintguy> Huh?
[05:12:00] <lintguy> I'm not looking to steal you or employ you...
[05:12:20] <Cork> not sure how else to read that line
[05:12:21] <lintguy> I mean partner as in, your companies partner program
[05:12:29] <Cork> ah
[05:12:53] <Cork> well apply for an account
[05:13:00] <lintguy> I knew you would say that
[05:13:04] <circ-user-EZ9cg> could someone help me figure out whats wrong with "officia.se/demo/guld" change page stops working after one use :<
[05:13:07] <Cork> :)
[05:13:16] <lintguy> Meh, nevermind then
[05:13:24] <Uhkis> ?ask
[05:13:24] <b-ot> Uhkis: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:13:31] <Uhkis> it's not dead, it just bugs!
[05:13:51] <Cork> lintguy: we have confidentiality agreement i can't give you any info at all anyway
[05:14:16] <lintguy> Cork: Ah, i can understand that.
[05:14:35] <lintguy> It's just that i don't really have the time to go through long hoops to get basic pricing info
[05:14:47] <lintguy> I'm quite sure it's too high anyway
[05:15:23] <Cork> lintguy: the reason is that we don't want to expose the margin partners take
[05:15:51] <lintguy> Cork: Ok
[05:16:26] <lintguy> That's my problem really, i have too low margins towards clients so i now i'm boxed in ;)
[05:17:28] <lintguy> And since most people compare to low cost hostings like glesys, then it's a real issue.
[05:17:46] <Cork> lintguy: well that is kinda the ida with our model, we are suppose to be a transparent layer that your customers doesn't even have to know exists
[05:18:37] <Cork> (compared to ex microsoft where they own the contact with the customer)
[05:18:45] <lintguy> Cork: I know, it's a great model, but you also need to earn your money.
[05:18:58] <Cork> sure
[05:19:25] <Cork> (i'm not a sells person so i'm not going to convince you one way or another)
[05:19:56] <lintguy> Cork: That's what i prefer, with sales it's hard to get any honest answer
[05:20:24] <Cork> well we don't really have any sells ppl
[05:20:47] <Cork> he have a support team that helps with problems and packaging problems
[05:21:17] <lintguy> Cork: Cool
[05:21:27] <Cork> (we've had in the past but it had poor results)
[05:21:37] <lintguy> I'll think about getting in touch
[05:39:00] <circ-user-EZ9cg> whats wrong with the mobile.changepage() @ http://officia.se/demo/guld/ ?
[05:46:39] <lintguy> Cork: Do you really support fully branded FQDN?
[05:47:01] <lintguy> Cork: I know hetzner doesn't, a traceroute shows who the host is.
[06:03:57] <circ-user-EZ9cg> why does $.mobile.changePage() only work once? Have I done something wrong?  http://officia.se/demo/guld/index.html
[06:46:08] <BarnaSzalai> hi
[06:46:37] <BarnaSzalai> is it possible that .serializeArray() can't handle multiselect select lists?
[06:47:04] <Cork> can you represent that in a params string?
[06:47:24] <BarnaSzalai> my select name is name[] but on php side I have only one value
[06:47:28] <BarnaSzalai> as string
[06:48:02] <BarnaSzalai> Cork: what do you mean sorry?
[06:49:24] <Kartagis> prolly dumb question, but I can't query database on element blur, can I?
[06:51:00] <BarnaSzalai> Kartagis: why not?
[06:51:03] <Cork> BarnaSzalai: http://jsfiddle.net/f60rdduh/3/
[06:51:04] <Cork> works fine here
[06:51:34] <Cork> Kartagis: depends on what database you're talking about (local or server side)
[06:51:58] <Kartagis> Cork: server side
[06:52:22] <Cork> Kartagis: then "query" would mean firing an ajax call
[06:52:42] <Cork> to the webserver and the webserver has to contact the database
[06:54:32] <BarnaSzalai> Cork: right, js serialization works, the prob should be the objects has the same name, and they overwrite each other
[06:54:35] <BarnaSzalai> http://kopy.io/jmVOs
[06:54:46] <BarnaSzalai> thats why I always get the last one
[06:57:11] <Kartagis> Cork: let me just tell you my end goal. my end goal is to find out whether that e-mail address exists on element blur
[07:06:08] <BarnaSzalai> yeah solved at server side, thanks for the aknowledgement with the fiddle
[07:26:20] <converge> Im looking for a pretty spinner, anyone knows one ?
[07:28:06] <Germanaz0> converge: I like to use font awesome, and use the fa-spin, because it's a SVG and it can scale as you want
[07:28:21] <Germanaz0> if you pretend to use just a GIF http://www.ajaxload.info/
[07:28:56] <Germanaz0> and this is for animated svg icons http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/#animated
[07:29:57] <converge> cool I'll need that later, but I mean input spinner button
[07:29:58] <lintguy> fortawesome?
[07:30:12] <arc_> and because it's vector and being transformed by the browser instead of photoshop, it can run at 144 fps :D
[07:30:24] <decx> use a superintendent gary chalmers gif and make a SPINNER! caption
[07:30:37] <lintguy> arc_: So it can spin REALLY fast?
[07:30:40] <Germanaz0> ah spin
[07:30:46] <Germanaz0> a spin input
[07:30:48] <arc_> just with better motion quality
[07:30:50] <Mandevil> Hello. When I replace "x.click()" with "x.on('click')", it stops working.... what gives?
[07:30:50] <vivekananda> hih everyone. Hello decx .
[07:31:01] <lintguy> decx: lol
[07:31:20] <converge> I need to do something like this http://cl.ly/image/3X3E2d092X2M
[07:31:21] <lintguy> arc_: I was just joking, i thought that was what we where doing now
[07:31:33] <arc_> i wasn't joking QQ
[07:31:54] <vivekananda> I am doing something stupid and getting an error on line 29 during a run. I believe ( guess) I cannot include a for loop like that inside a .done() function. Can someone comment ?  http://pastie.org/10200532
[07:32:15] <lintguy> vivekananda: That's correct, you can't
[07:32:35] <vivekananda> lintguy, I guessed as much. What can I do in place for the same functionality. ?
[07:32:50] <lintguy> vivekananda: though i'm no expert, but i believe promises can't have that
[07:33:09] <lintguy> vivekananda: add it to a callback
[07:33:51] <Germanaz0> converge: like this ? https://jqueryui.com/spinner/
[07:34:20] <converge> Germanaz0: yes, but that's not pretty, I need some fancy, it's kind hard to find
[07:34:28] <lintguy> vivekananda: It might even be cleaner to have it in a callback there
[07:34:30] <Germanaz0> bootstrap
[07:34:37] <lintguy> vivekananda: That's a lot of code
[07:35:06] <lintguy> vivekananda: and you are not caching any selectors
[07:35:18] <decx> there you go, the last spinner you'll ever need http://i.imgur.com/q2jFng2.gif
[07:35:23] <lintguy> vivekananda: and why are you not using jquery for selectors when you are already using it for ajax?
[07:38:34] <Mandevil> Hm, I isolated the problem ".on('click', function(){})" while ".on('click', parm, function(evt){})" doesn't.
[07:38:47] <Mandevil> The first works.
[07:39:08] <Mandevil> .on() doesn't support data for the callback?
[07:40:15] <De0Sama> Hello everyone. I have a table with a button on every row. I need to run custom code on this button (they all do the same thing (sends an email to the email in the row)). I can't get my code to run!
[07:40:29] <Mandevil> Hm, so ".on('click', null, parm, function(){})" works.
[07:41:06] <De0Sama> at first I tried putting an id on the button, but obviously there was more than one of the same id on the page, so i changed it to a class, but it still doesn't work. :(
[07:41:13] <De0Sama> any suggestions?
[07:43:09] <Mandevil> De0Sama: Try to replicate the problem in jsfiddle.
[07:43:16] <Mandevil> De0Sama: In as minimal form as possible.
[07:43:19] <De0Sama> Mandevil, ok, one second :)
[07:43:27] <vivekananda> lintguy, I am new to this too and built it from an example ( jquery UI ) . I am going to change it to include caching
[07:44:22] <lintguy> vivekananda: Great :)
[07:45:23] <vivekananda> lintguy, as to call back I am not sure I know how I would do that to get a for loop. As to jquery for selectors , what line ? And as to caching where and how. I don't know much of caching so I have to know learn that. I believe there is an example in  http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote-with-cache  . is this what you are talking about vis a vis caching ?
[07:45:24] <lintguy> vivekananda: i noticed that errors in a success function might not always bubble, for example if an element can't be found it will just silently not work, so that may be the issue
[07:46:03] <vivekananda> lintguy, i am getting an error on line 29 in dev tools saying tolowercase on undefined is not possible or something
[07:46:14] <vivekananda> hence I guessed that for loop like that wont work
[07:46:22] <lintguy> vivekananda: For caching the response, you can just put it into a variable that is outside of the ajax call. Then when you call that variable, you will get the cached response. If you run the ajax again, the cache will be updated.
[07:46:45] <lintguy> vivekananda: As for selector caching it works the same way, just define the selector in a variable and then use that variable to get the selector in your code
[07:47:09] <lintguy> vivekananda: yeah, if you get an error the script will stop there
[07:47:21] <De0Sama> Mandevil, https://jsfiddle.net/c1zwzrmg/
[07:47:58] <De0Sama> or, maybe this would even be better: https://jsfiddle.net/c1zwzrmg/1/
[07:48:04] <De0Sama> since there will never just be 1 row in there
[07:48:22] <lintguy> vivekananda: watch this to get some insight into how to debug https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOEw9iiopwI
[07:48:26] <vivekananda> lintguy, I guess I will need to look at an example to understand caching better. I understood what you said
[07:48:27] <vivekananda> ok great
[07:48:40] <De0Sama> hmmm..... that IS working!
[07:48:41] <De0Sama> wtf?
[07:48:41] <vivekananda> oo ok sorry . I thought you gave me a link to caching examples
[07:49:12] <vivekananda> lintguy, before I go with cacching I need to find out how to include a callback and get that for loop working
[07:49:28] <Mandevil> De0Sama: Looks like it works.
[07:49:38] <Mandevil> De0Sama: At least I'm getting the log entries.
[07:49:50] <Mandevil> De0Sama: Haha, you already noticed.
[07:50:06] <De0Sama> yeah...
[07:50:07] <De0Sama> hmmmm
[07:50:13] <De0Sama> looks like it might have something to do with a library i'm using
[07:50:15] <De0Sama> gah
[07:50:20] <De0Sama> thanks :)
[07:50:32] <Mandevil> Anyone knows jquery.appear plugin?
[07:50:49] <lintguy> vivekananda: fix the undefined error first
[07:51:11] <lintguy> vivekananda: and check that video, so you know how to debug
[07:51:53] <vivekananda> lintguy, the undefined error needs me to know how to use a callback inside the .done(). I am not sure I know how. I was trying to look at examples for it
[07:52:01] <vivekananda> for the syntax specifically
[07:52:39] <lintguy> vivekananda: I think it should work with the code you have there, but the script stops on your error
[07:52:50] <lintguy> vivekananda: so no need for callback functions
[07:53:15] <vivekananda> lintguy, the for loop is non-conforming to the syntax so it stops in there.
[07:53:26] <vivekananda> so how do I change the for loop to something that works
[07:56:39] <lintguy> vivekananda: do you even get a response?
[07:56:57] <lintguy> validOptions, does it contain the data the for loop is checking?
[07:57:08] <vivekananda> lintguy, yeah I get a dropdown
[07:57:14] <vivekananda> lintguy, lemme show you one sec
[07:57:44] <lintguy> vivekananda: i don't time to check, need to go from work
[07:57:52] <lintguy> bbl
[07:57:56] <vivekananda> ok
[07:59:53] <vivekananda> anyone else comment on it. Tell me the correct of writing the for loop in line 28 https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae . Line 29 is giving me errors saying  Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined(anonymous function).
[08:18:32] <shoky> vivekananda: for (var i = 0; i < validOptions.length; i++) { ... }
[08:18:49] <vivekananda> shoky, yeah
[08:18:53] <shoky> vivekananda: also  you're using "this.value" but "this" is not what you want
[08:18:56] <vivekananda> I found another nifty way
[08:19:00] <vivekananda> why ?
[08:19:19] <vivekananda> shoky, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach  . using every :)
[08:19:22] <shoky> because "this" changes in each function, and you're in an ajax callback function
[08:21:22] <vivekananda> shoky, yeah I got that but I assume this would refer to the current filling up block still wont it ?
[08:21:29] <vivekananda> what will this refer to there I wonder
[08:21:38] <shoky> the current block is the ajax callback
[08:22:16] <circ-user-WbLVE> could you guys/gals help me debugging a page for me :) ?
[08:22:18] <vivekananda> yeah so what does this represent there ? what specific element
[08:22:19] <shoky> and it refers to the ajax settings or something, by default. you can set the "context" option of $.ajax to change "this" inside if you want
[08:22:38] <shoky> vivekananda: not any element, just the ajax settings or something
[08:22:58] <vivekananda> shoky, that is fine. I can just call the element using the dom handle or id and then use that insted of this
[08:23:18] <vivekananda> shoky, though it will be fun to see what 'this' currently has right :) ?
[08:23:37] <shoky> or set the context like i said, or using .bind(this) on the callback,  or  var self = this;  or make up your own ;p
[08:23:56] <shoky> vivekananda: well you're getting that error which means it's probably not something with a .value ;p
[08:24:37] <vivekananda> shoky, someone told me in javascript that it can be because the for loop I am using is wrong coz for__ in is not the correct iterator for arrays
[08:24:50] <vivekananda> so I should be using forEach or  .every()
[08:25:05] <shoky> vivekananda that's also right, first thing i told you was the right "for"
[08:25:12] <vivekananda> shoky, also, I am getting values in validOptions. I checked in the debugger. It is not null
[08:25:26] <shoky> nobody said it didn't have values ;p
[08:25:32] <vivekananda> shoky, yep you did
[08:25:35] <shoky> nope
[08:26:02] <vivekananda> no no I meant 'yep you did' for ---  <shoky> vivekananda that's also right, first thing i told you was the right "for".
[08:26:10] <shoky> ahh k
[08:26:30] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't even use an iterator in the first place.
[08:26:36] <robertmaxrees> use forEach() instead.
[08:26:45] <vivekananda> so I am guessing if I correct the for loop and change the 'this' that should be all right ?
[08:26:45] <shoky> yep he knows
[08:27:16] <circ-user-WbLVE> whats wrong with the page changing on this site: http://officia.se/demo/guld/ ?
[08:27:22] <shoky> vivekananda it would fix those errors yup. then you get to tackle the next ones ;)
[08:27:25] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, l also saw a very nice .every() too on the same page --- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
[08:27:33] <vivekananda> yeah on it
[08:27:57] <robertmaxrees> i was late to the party so i don't even know what we're talking about haha
[08:28:34] <shoky> as long as it's not food, as i am starving, and lazy.
[08:29:19] <shoky> hmm pizza.
[08:29:55] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, no worries. The error was simple to explain. I have a jquery autocomplete ( built from a UI example.) I moved code from withing .keyup to .done(). I am getting an error on line 28 . Here is the code  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae
[08:30:21] <vivekananda> circ-user-WbLVE, you page didn't load for me :(
[08:30:41] <vivekananda> I am pretty much a novice but would be fun to look at it
[08:31:05] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.  vivekananda are you trying to see if ANYTHING passes that if check?
[08:32:44] <circ-user-WbLVE> Please try again :)
[08:34:19] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda http://fixee.org/paste/v37ggva/ could do something like this instead.
[08:34:46] <robertmaxrees> circ-user-WbLVE start by fixing your console errors.
[08:35:28] <robertmaxrees> you're missing a doctype, a character encoding, and you have an undeclared variable.
[08:37:16] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I merely tried to see if it works and see an error on line 28 saying Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined . so it ie either 'validOptions' or the 'i' . it is not validOptions ( I checked) :)
[08:37:40] <robertmaxrees> you realize that wasn't a drop-in fix, right?
[08:37:52] <robertmaxrees> return currentOption.toLowerCase.match($theCorrectedThis.value.toLowerCase()); - "$theCorrectedThis" doesn't exist.  you need to fix that.
[08:38:12] <robertmaxrees> i was more showing you that you want Array.fn.some();, not every.
[08:38:32] <circ-user-WbLVE> please check again. those didn't change a thing eitherway
[08:39:17] <circ-user-WbLVE> swipe to navigate
[08:39:19] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, lol, now I have to ask which of the lines above you meant for me vs for circ :). please use my name for my refs !
[08:39:28] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda you
[08:39:47] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, but I got that it is not a fix just you showing me how to use some rather than if.
[08:40:04] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda right - you want .some() here.
[08:40:18] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, but why would every() be wrong ?
[08:40:19] <robertmaxrees> circ-user-WbLVE could you maybe actually describe your problem?  All I'm getting is an empty page.
[08:40:50] <circ-user-WbLVE> swipe to the left once
[08:40:56] <robertmaxrees> and then what?
[08:40:58] <circ-user-WbLVE> then to the right
[08:41:04] <circ-user-WbLVE> and then to the left again
[08:41:05] <robertmaxrees> don't make us guess what the issue is.
[08:41:31] <circ-user-WbLVE> the page changing happens multiple times when it's not supposed to
[08:41:49] <robertmaxrees> okay.  where is your code?
[08:42:26] <circ-user-WbLVE> bottom of the page
[08:42:57] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, lemme write a quick code and ask you then ( replacing the for)
[08:43:32] <pauled> Hi, in that code grabbed in stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/a/19129181 work with checkbox, but I don't get it how I can use it with dropdown list. http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/jpp2L10m/
[08:43:39] <robertmaxrees> circ-user-WbLVE try inserting a console.log('foo'); as the first thing in the event binding.  how many times do you see it?
[08:44:35] <robertmaxrees> pauled huh?  what is it supposed to do?
[08:45:06] <robertmaxrees> pauled you mean you want to store and set the dropdown?  because you use .val() for that.
[08:45:07] <pauled> is supposed to store value in localStorage
[08:45:42] <dimi1947> I am having troubling appending an image onmouse over
[08:45:46] <dimi1947> in a div
[08:45:47] <pauled> yeah I want to use localstorage to set selected
[08:46:12] <robertmaxrees> pauled right.  so on change, you store the dropdown value in localstorage.
[08:46:24] <robertmaxrees> then you later set the value after the page loads.
[08:46:40] <EminenceHC> I am using $("input#intake_agreement_password") as a selector. I am trying to find its parent div .closest("div.signature_block") doesn't seem to work. I suspect because maybe input field is not a DOM element? How can I select that div?
[08:47:01] <pauled> robertmaxrees: what is supposed to do this: var chk0wasChked = (localStorage.getItem('isautoberserk') == "true");
[08:47:04] <robertmaxrees> inputs are dom elements, EminenceHC
[08:47:16] <pauled> robertmaxrees: if it exist?
[08:47:28] <robertmaxrees> !g mdn localstorage @ pauled
[08:47:29] <b-ot> pauled: DOM Storage guide - Web developer guide | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage
[08:47:34] <robertmaxrees> ^ read this pauled
[08:47:54] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC you don't need to supply the tagname in those selectors.
[08:47:55] <pauled> robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[08:48:15] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: div and input?
[08:48:28] <robertmaxrees> $('#intake_agreement_password').closest('.signature_block');
[08:48:34] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: ah I see
[08:48:47] <robertmaxrees> that will fail only if the first selector is bad, or the second selector is bad.
[08:48:48] <robertmaxrees> or both.
[08:49:00] <circ-user-WbLVE> robertmaxrees: Foo once on init, Bar increments with one each time i swipe to the left, rab = bar +1
[08:49:44] <robertmaxrees> circ-user-WbLVE duno, then.  i'd start removing your code to see where the problem lies.
[08:49:55] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is a fantastic guide btw.
[08:53:42] <ilhami> hey :P
[08:53:46] <ilhami> anyone ever used datatables? :P
[08:53:56] <robertmaxrees> lots of people have, ilhami
[08:54:05] <ilhami> also with Laravel? :P
[08:54:15] <robertmaxrees> that part is kind of irrelevant.
[08:54:21] <robertmaxrees> data is data
[08:54:31] <ilhami> yeah I guess so. :)
[08:59:01] <circ-user-WbLVE> Well.. i've limited it down so that i only get 2 calls each time
[08:59:26] <circ-user-WbLVE> no idea where the loop comes from but it's an improvement
[09:05:55] <circ-user-WbLVE> Well i got it working :>
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  what was it?
[09:07:30] <circ-user-WbLVE> since i used pagecontainer("change") to load the pages AND(here is the important thing) since it loads the page i ended up with duplicated functions each time i went back the the index page.
[09:07:37] <robertmaxrees> aaaaah
[09:07:40] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[09:07:59] <tsmith> I want to create a web app where once a word is typed by a user, the admin can see the word on their screen, so that they can watch the end-user type as they are typing... is jquery sufficient?
[09:08:14] <robertmaxrees> tsmith no.
[09:08:17] <robertmaxrees> you need websockets for that.
[09:08:44] <circ-user-WbLVE> wpf might be able to ?
[09:09:01] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:09:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not for webapps.
[09:09:14] <circ-user-WbLVE> you still need a server to handle the data tho
[09:09:27] <circ-user-WbLVE> you can make a web form with wpf
[09:09:36] <tsmith> robertmaxrees, why is jquery insufficient? Is it possible for jquery to watch the letters typed and when the user hits " " or ", . "'!?" send the text to the backend?
[09:09:40] <robertmaxrees> right, but that doesn't handle the client-side, circ-user-WbLVE
[09:09:57] <robertmaxrees> tsmith you could do that if you wanted, though it's not going to be as smooth as it could be.
[09:10:07] <robertmaxrees> websockets would be a much better choice.
[09:10:20] <tsmith> robertmaxrees, i will look into websockets. thank you
[09:11:44] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, could you look at box 2 as a replacement for the 'for'. Is it wrong ? nonsensical ? https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae .
[09:12:01] <Justus> I'd like to add a small chat with a user list to a specific page in a complex tool, to allow people to see when someone else might be working on the same page, do you have suggestions on what might be suitable for this?
[09:12:08] <vivekananda> sorry one sec
[09:12:11] <vivekananda> one more correction
[09:12:21] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda that doesn't make any sense.
[09:12:28] <robertmaxrees> Justus websockets
[09:12:37] <Justus> I'm torn between handwriting it (jquery + redis or something) and using something existing (like xmpp, or other im protocolls)
[09:12:40] <vivekananda> https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae
[09:12:51] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, ^^
[09:13:05] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda don't put your if statement within the .every()
[09:13:23] <Justus> robertmaxrees: websockets is a technology, not a tool as such ;)
[09:13:34] <robertmaxrees> Justus and the right technology to use in this case.
[09:13:35] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, syntactically wrong ? or something else ?
[09:13:35] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:13:46] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda not how you traditionally use every.  one sec.
[09:14:15] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I was looking at the example here -- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for
[09:14:24] <Justus> robertmaxrees: unless there are some implementations (which I don't know) that suit my needs it probably isn't. The question was aimed at the actual implementations, since I don't have experience with any of them
[09:14:25] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda hold up dude.
[09:14:39] <SuperTyp> hello everybody
[09:14:46] <vivekananda> sure sure. I am just saying I was looking here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach . take your time
[09:15:08] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda you're not using foreach dude.
[09:15:11] <robertmaxrees> yopu're using every ;)
[09:15:26] <robertmaxrees> wait you wanted .some(), not every
[09:15:36] <circ-user-WbLVE> Justus: Asp.net i guess. but you will still need a server client for the data handling
[09:15:42] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, yeah . go a little below on the forEach page. there is .every() there with examples
[09:15:51] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda but every isn't what you want.
[09:15:54] <robertmaxrees> nor is foreach.
[09:16:06] <robertmaxrees> you're curious to know if some element in the array matches some criteria - http://fixee.org/paste/1pycu6x/#url=nh2acs6
[09:16:10] <robertmaxrees> your code will look something like this.
[09:16:20] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, hence the question. why is every , forEach not suited for this but .some() is ? I didn't get that
[09:16:34] <robertmaxrees> every checks if everyu element passes a predicate.
[09:16:44] <robertmaxrees> foreach runs code for each object in an array.
[09:16:52] <robertmaxrees> some sees if some object in the array passes a predicate.
[09:17:21] <vivekananda> oo aha. inclusive vs exclusive okay . so some then :)
[09:17:38] <vivekananda> so if some returns false then it means none matched
[09:18:12] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, so I cannot use an if inside some either ?
[09:20:10] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda you don't want to.
[09:20:13] <robertmaxrees> some returns the boolean.
[09:20:34] <robertmaxrees> basically, the callback in some should ONLY return a boolean, not do anything else.
[09:20:56] <robertmaxrees> it's not that you can't do it, but it makes your code harder to read later.
[09:22:13] <robertmaxrees> Justus what backend are you working with?
[09:22:53] <robertmaxrees> because socket.io could work depending on your requirements.
[09:23:25] <Justus> robertmaxrees: pyramid/wsgi/apache, also there's a redis already deployed, this is more a case of "is there something existing I can make work for the simple case I have, or do I write it from scratch?"
[09:23:45] <robertmaxrees> right.  so i'm providing ideas for you to run with.
[09:24:52] <robertmaxrees> iirc the socket.io site even shows you how to setup a chat app in the guides, which is what made me think of it.
[09:25:09] <robertmaxrees> but that needs either node.js in the back or a port to whatever platform you're using.
[09:26:20] <Justus> robertmaxrees: since it is basically writing from scratch only with other technology I'd go for redis/python-pyramid and jquery/websockets if I had to do that
[09:26:44] <Justus> robertmaxrees: I am trying to evaluate if there are solutions that you just throw on there and they work
[09:26:53] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> i get that.
[09:27:47] <arc_> what are some possible reasons for an element that has 0 margin and 0 padding to be displayed with padding
[09:28:05] <arc_> even chrome's inspector, at the bottom where it shows the dimensions of the object, padding, and margin
[09:28:09] <robertmaxrees> arc_ a child element has margins and paddings.
[09:28:21] <robertmaxrees> and the layout is such that it's impacting the parent element.
[09:29:29] <arc_> idk. http://porath.org/w/mcc5/aboutus.html
[09:29:41] <robertmaxrees> which element?
[09:29:44] <arc_> i can see that the image itself (the logo at the top) has no margin and padding on the element itself
[09:29:49] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:30:12] <robertmaxrees> where are you trying to kill space from? above it?
[09:30:18] <arc_> i want the logo to appear larger
[09:30:25] <pauled> robertmaxrees: please help, I am stuck with that, I get this: [object Object] as value in localStorage. http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/jpp2L10m/
[09:30:37] <robertmaxrees> arc_how large?
[09:30:56] <arc_> how about 85 pixels
[09:31:00] <arc_> tall
[09:31:15] <robertmaxrees> you want it to show at its native height then?
[09:31:27] <arc_> yeah, i guess it is 82 pixels
[09:31:50] <robertmaxrees> it's already showing at its native height.
[09:32:05] <arc_> for me, it's 59.4219px
[09:32:18] <robertmaxrees> oh chrome is different.
[09:32:33] <robertmaxrees> that parent div is the problem - col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-8
[09:32:34] <arc_> that's disconcerting
[09:33:04] <robertmaxrees> change that to just col-xs-12.  let it always take up the top row.  problem solved.
[09:33:17] <arc_> oh is it because of the width omg
[09:33:24] <arc_> wow. i can't believe i didn't notice that
[09:33:26] <arc_> all right thanks
[09:33:45] <robertmaxrees> pauled you're aware your browser has built-in developer tools, right?
[09:34:41] <robertmaxrees> pauled how do i replicate your bug?
[09:35:11] <pauled> refresh http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/jpp2L10m/
[09:35:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:35:35] <pauled> I don't understand ^^
[09:35:46] <robertmaxrees> neither do i - what's your question?
[09:35:48] <pauled> i am confused now ^^
[09:36:05] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: thx for the hint with parent event delegation
[09:36:12] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp deffo
[09:36:19] <SuperTyp> what? :D
[09:36:27] <robertmaxrees> short for "definitely"
[09:36:40] <pauled> the value is not stored in localstorage et it doesn't restore the value if I manually refresh
[09:36:42] <SuperTyp> and that means? :)
[09:36:54] <SuperTyp> in this context I guess yw?
[09:37:09] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp kind of like "any time" or "you're welcome"
[09:37:17] <SuperTyp> thanks bro
[09:37:34] <robertmaxrees> pauled okay.  then store it?
[09:37:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand where you're lost.
[09:38:50] <pauled> robertmaxrees: the dropdown list "RatingDiff" doesn't work
[09:39:43] <pauled> robertmaxrees: If I select a value in the dropdown list, it doesn"t store it
[09:39:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:39:49] <robertmaxrees> let's start with that.
[09:39:55] <robertmaxrees> first off, var diff0isSel = diff0.val('selected'); isn't what you want.
[09:40:09] <pauled> thanks
[09:40:17] <robertmaxrees> you want var diff0isSel = diff0.val(); instead.
[09:40:38] <robertmaxrees> in both cases.
[09:40:53] <robertmaxrees> start there.
[09:41:46] * vivekananda is back
[09:42:27] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, if there was some need of using an if inside .some() would I be able to use it ? I mean is it syntactically correct ?
[09:42:35] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda again.
[09:42:41] <robertmaxrees> you *can* do it, but it's not a good idea.
[09:42:44] <robertmaxrees> it leads to confusing code.
[09:43:21] <robertmaxrees> it has to do with functional purity.  the job of .some() is to see if any elements in the array pass a test.  that's all that code should do.
[09:43:31] <vivekananda> yeah I was asking about can. I was thinking of code
[09:43:40] <lemonsparrow> what am I getting the error Exception: TypeError: undefined is not a function (evaluating 'this.getElements('outboundCalendarPrices')') for this js https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/b094e5703b94eedfcc11
[09:43:41] <lemonsparrow>  .can anyone help pls
[09:43:43] <vivekananda> ahaa, okay no ifs and buts there. I agree completely with you
[09:43:46] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I updated, removed select in both var diff0isSel http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/jpp2L10m/12/ but now it doesn't restor the value from localStorage.
[09:44:07] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow there's no "getelements" method
[09:45:01] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, got it.. oops.. my bad.. how to define a method to fetch specific elementIdentifiers by key..
[09:45:46] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, to define getElements to fetch data by identifier in elementIdentifiers
[09:45:48] <vivekananda> I am all for modular and SRP ( single responsibility principle code). :) .
[09:45:56] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, I am bit confused by it..
[09:51:29] <robertmaxrees> back.
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow not sure what you mean.
[09:53:21] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, implement function in line 28 https://gist.github.com/mithunsasidharan/ae122c9acbacd78472fa
[09:53:48] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow nope.  there's no getElements() defined in this gist.
[09:53:48] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, such that var outboundCalendarPrices=this.getElements('outboundCalendarPrices'); in line 22 returns  {
[09:53:48] <lemonsparrow>         identifier:'prices in outboundJourney',
[09:53:48] <lemonsparrow>         type:'repeater',
[09:53:48] <lemonsparrow>         wait:'3000'
[09:53:48] <lemonsparrow>     }
[09:53:56] <robertmaxrees> please do not paste into the channel.
[09:54:03] <robertmaxrees> and there is no getElements function.
[09:54:03] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, well thats what I am trying to define..
[09:54:11] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, line 28
[09:54:18] <robertmaxrees> please stop repeating "line 28"
[09:54:23] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, FlightSelectionPage.prototype.getElements = function(key){
[09:54:25] <robertmaxrees> i needed youto clarify your problem.
[09:54:46] <AliG1000> Hi - I am trying to open a popup window if I hover over an element for 1 second, but do nothing if I hover for less than 1 second.  I am almost there:  http://jsbin.com/kafahubayo/1/edit?js
[09:55:32] <robertmaxrees> lemonsparrow oh, you're asking in ##javascript as well - i'll let them help you first.
[09:55:43] <lemonsparrow> when I call debug(this.getElements('outboundCalendarPrices');); it should return property outboundCalendarPrices: { identifier:'prices in outboundJourney', type:'repeater', wait:'3000'}
[09:56:01] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, I asked it long back .. not now.
[09:56:07] <robertmaxrees> they responded to you.
[09:58:27] <lemonsparrow> robertmaxrees, yep thanks
[09:58:59] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 maybe just use https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent instead?
[09:59:02] <robertmaxrees> or see hye they do it?
[09:59:39] <AliG1000> @robertmaxrees I did see that.  It's my fallback plan
[10:00:28] <AliG1000> (PHP = no problem for me.  For some reason I have a brain block with Javascript)
[10:00:34] <robertmaxrees> i'd just use hoverIntent
[10:03:31] <pauled> googling my issue, nothing ound how to update selected value from localstorage
[10:03:43] <pauled> ound/found*
[10:03:56] <robertmaxrees> .setItem()
[10:07:04] <pauled> thanks, with this word now I find many result :))
[10:07:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:07:15] <robertmaxrees> i linked you to the mdn page.
[10:07:17] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[10:09:51] <pauled> hmm I am confused, setItem() is to set value in localstorage, but what I want is to update the selected item in dropdown list from localstorage value
[10:09:57] <_August_> Question... How would a offset a scrollto for when a user goes to the page after clicking a link?
[10:10:05] <robertmaxrees> pauled you have to use setItem() again.
[10:10:18] <robertmaxrees> _August_ huh?
[10:10:31] <_August_> lol yeah im trying to wrap my head around it right now
[10:10:46] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to scroll to an element plus some?
[10:11:00] <hrolf> Hi #jquery.
[10:11:28] <robertmaxrees> hi hrolf!
[10:11:35] <_August_> scroll to an element after the page is loaded
[10:11:43] <_August_> or before the page is loaded
[10:11:51] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[10:11:55] <robertmaxrees> you want it after the page is loaded.
[10:11:59] <robertmaxrees> or at least on document ready.
[10:12:07] <_August_> yeah i thought that
[10:12:31] <_August_> hmmm
[10:12:37] <robertmaxrees> $(function() { $(window).scrollTop($('.someElement').offset().top )});
[10:12:38] <_August_> let me play with a few options
[10:12:46] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just use a hash in the url.
[10:13:00] <_August_> well thats the problem
[10:13:10] <_August_> there is a hash in the url
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[10:13:19] <_August_> and the menu is fixed
[10:13:26] <_August_> so everything goes under the menu
[10:13:37] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, so you want to scroll there, minus a little.
[10:13:52] <_August_> so im thinking of a way to scroll to the element from the hash url and add offset for the menu
[10:13:55] <_August_> yeha
[10:13:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[10:13:58] <_August_> exactly
[10:15:21] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/9xjpwem/
[10:15:24] <robertmaxrees> something like that.
[10:17:10] <|RicharD|> hey guys
[10:17:25] <|RicharD|> there is a way for check how many ajax connections are running ?
[10:18:06] <pauled> robertmaxrees: but setItem is already used in line 40. I don't get it how I can use it to make this list selected
[10:18:26] <robertmaxrees> pauled you mean you're tring to set the dropdown, not localstorage?
[10:18:31] <_August_> thanks, going to try it out
[10:19:05] <pauled> robertmaxrees: yeah, the localstorage is already set, I want to update the list like for the checkbox
[10:19:24] <robertmaxrees> pauled in that case, set the value of the list to the value of the option you want.
[10:19:58] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| i think there's jQuery.ajax.active, but i'd avoid using it if possible.
[10:20:05] <pauled> robertmaxrees: that is the problem, I want it set with the value stored in localstorage
[10:20:08] <|RicharD|> why ?
[10:21:23] <pauled> robertmaxrees: please look the checkbox you will understad my problem. The checkbox state is updated from localstorage
[10:21:59] <pauled> robertmaxrees: line 27 do that
[10:23:09] <robertmaxrees> pauled right, so use .val(theThingFromLocalStorage) to set it.
[10:23:11] <robertmaxrees> easy peasy
[10:23:21] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| why does the current number matter?
[10:23:31] <|RicharD|> because I've an animation
[10:23:38] <|RicharD|> that is attached with ajaxStart
[10:23:39] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| you should use deferreds for that instead.
[10:23:51] <|RicharD|> and stop with ajaxComplete
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you want deferreds instead.
[10:23:59] <|RicharD|> but I've 2 ajax connections (one is in success callback of the first)
[10:24:10] <|RicharD|> what is it ? link ?
[10:24:22] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.when/
[10:24:28] <robertmaxrees> also: https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:24:46] <robertmaxrees> and finally: https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/deferreds/examples/
[10:24:57] <pauled> robertmaxrees: thanks :)) line 30: diff0.val(diff0wasSel); //this is correct?
[10:25:09] <robertmaxrees> pauled i closed it a long time ago.
[10:25:25] <|RicharD|> thx a lot
[10:25:41] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| deffo :D
[10:26:56] <pauled> robertmaxrees: so the code now is correct ? :) http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/jpp2L10m/15/
[10:27:18] <robertmaxrees> did you try it?
[10:27:27] <pauled> sure
[10:27:32] <robertmaxrees> and did it work?
[10:27:49] <pauled> but I mean if the code is well writted
[10:27:57] <robertmaxrees> not particular.
[10:28:09] <robertmaxrees> *particularly
[10:28:11] <pauled> thanks a lot robertmaxrees
[10:28:25] <robertmaxrees> for instance, don't use == and != ever
[10:28:28] <robertmaxrees> use === and !==
[10:28:44] <pauled> in what line?
[10:28:58] <Puck6633> Can anyone explain to me what I'm doing wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/63gbkmv7/
[10:28:59] <robertmaxrees> any place you use == and !=
[10:29:13] <pauled> robertmaxrees: line 9 is not correct? var chk0wasChked = (localStorage.getItem('isautoberserk') == "true");
[10:29:18] <Puck6633> If I open the inspector on the fiddle frame and click the text I get "test" but no POST request.
[10:29:27] <robertmaxrees> Puck6633 i see a post in the network tab.
[10:29:47] <robertmaxrees> pauled line 9, line 26, and 29
[10:30:19] <Puck6633> robertmaxrees: Oh, really? That's strange. THis issue has been driving me nuts for a while.
[10:30:26] <Puck6633> Maybe it's an issue with Firefox's inspector.
[10:30:28] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab.
[10:30:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm in firefox.
[10:30:47] <robertmaxrees> the console won't show that request fwiw.
[10:30:51] <Puck6633> I have net enabled, and I'm seeing lots of other GET and POST requests.
[10:30:53] <robertmaxrees> you need to be in the network tab.
[10:31:19] <pauled> robertmaxrees: following this http://stackoverflow.com/a/523650 seems correct to me
[10:31:40] <robertmaxrees> pauled right, don't ever use ==
[10:31:47] <robertmaxrees> type coercion is not your friend in most cases.
[10:31:53] <Puck6633> robertmaxrees: Ah, I see. I've always been able to see these sorts of things on the console before. Maybe it's a recent change?
[10:32:17] <robertmaxrees> Puck6633 disabling and reenabling in the console fixed it for me i guess.   i always rely on the network tab for that sort of stuff instead anyway
[10:33:01] <pauled> robertmaxrees: what is type coercion there is a link documentation?
[10:33:46] <Talow> Is this channel for receiving help with jqueryui?
[10:34:05] <Puck6633> robertmaxrees: I figured it out. Clicking the caret next to "Net" on the console I found that XHR requests were being filtered out. I toggled it and now I see the requests. Thanks for the heads up! I'll make sure to check the Network tab in the future. :)
[10:34:06] <robertmaxrees> Talow yes
[10:34:14] <robertmaxrees> Puck6633 there you go :)
[10:34:34] <robertmaxrees> pauled type coersion is why 1 == '1'; is true, but 1 === '1'; is false.
[10:35:05] <robertmaxrees> it convers the types of things, which can hide errors in code.
[10:35:21] <samssh> robertmaxrees, I do fine (false == "") === true to be handy though.
[10:35:26] <pauled> but 1 is suposed to be true? like 0 for false? I don't get it
[10:35:47] <robertmaxrees> samssh huh?
[10:35:52] <robertmaxrees> you mean falsy values?
[10:36:02] <robertmaxrees> pauled any number can do that.
[10:36:02] <samssh> Yeah, falsy values.
[10:36:21] <robertmaxrees> 5 == '5' is true but 5 === '5' is false
[10:36:36] <robertmaxrees> samssh in those cases, i ditch the comparison entirely.
[10:36:41] <robertmaxrees> if (someThing) {}
[10:36:46] <Talow> == is value, === is type && value
[10:36:51] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:36:52] <samssh> Yeah
[10:37:32] <pauled> robertmaxrees: if 5 === '5' is false then 5 === ?
[10:37:37] <robertmaxrees> 5
[10:37:39] <robertmaxrees> 5 === 5
[10:37:53] <Talow> 5 is a type of int, '5' is type of char or string
[10:37:58] <robertmaxrees> *type of number
[10:38:01] <pauled> robertmaxrees: but 5 === 5 is false?
[10:38:05] <Talow> right sorry number
[10:38:07] <robertmaxrees> 5 === 5 is true
[10:38:11] <robertmaxrees> 5 === '5' is false
[10:38:23] <Talow> the '' denotes string/char
[10:38:26] <robertmaxrees> pauled http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/53co5vg5/
[10:38:44] <pauled> hmmm then what difference between '5' and 5?
[10:38:50] <robertmaxrees> '5' is a string.
[10:38:52] <robertmaxrees> 5 is a number.
[10:38:56] <robertmaxrees> they are different "types"
[10:40:09] <pauled> is a string because is quoted? then don't use quote for number?
[10:40:22] <robertmaxrees> use whatever type is appropriate for the case
[10:40:50] <robertmaxrees> if you need strings, use strings.  if you need numbers, use numbers.  just don't try to compare strings against numbers unless you have a good reason to, and be explicit about it.
[10:40:54] <Talow> I'm using jquery sortable with a UL I want to set it to change the value of a hidden input when the user changes the order of the list to reflect the change. How would I do this, or is there a better way?
[10:41:11] <pauled> what are wrong is to use quote for a number? no?
[10:41:29] <robertmaxrees> pauled right, but that doesn't mean no number can ever be a string.
[10:41:35] <pauled> I mean not the trip equal
[10:41:37] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you legitimately need a string.
[10:41:59] <Talow> it's not wrong to use quotes on a number. It is only wrong to think that the type of string is the same as the number type
[10:42:07] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:43:05] <Talow> a stirng can contain any character as apart of it's value, number can only be numbers (and some things that denotes the number like - or .)
[10:43:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:43:41] <Talow> the type clearifies what the value can hold
[10:43:58] <pauled> robertmaxrees: so === "true" is correct to use quote?
[10:44:11] <robertmaxrees> in your case, because localstorage stores strings, yes.
[10:45:09] <pauled> can I write it like foo === true; or foo === 1; ?
[10:45:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:45:26] <robertmaxrees> "true" and true are different types
[10:45:31] <robertmaxrees> the quotes are important.
[10:45:33] <pauled> ahhh
[10:45:43] <pauled> confused again ^^
[10:45:45] <Talow> pauled:  http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp
[10:45:52] <robertmaxrees> don't link to w3schools please.
[10:45:53] <pauled> I was close to understand
[10:45:56] <robertmaxrees> it's often confusing.
[10:45:57] <Talow> oh sorry
[10:45:58] <robertmaxrees> and/or wrong.
[10:46:23] <robertmaxrees> let me look for a good example.
[10:46:51] <robertmaxrees> http://code.tutsplus.com/articles/the-beginners-guide-to-type-coercion-a-practical-example--cms-21998 try this
[10:47:23] <pauled> thanks :)
[10:47:30] <Talow> what about msdn?
[10:47:33] <Talow> https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7wkd9z69%28v=vs.94%29.aspx
[10:47:45] <robertmaxrees> msdn and mdn are fine.
[10:47:50] <robertmaxrees> but w3schools is bad bad bad
[10:48:00] <Talow> I've never had issues with it
[10:48:05] <Talow> but I'll take word for it
[10:48:06] <Uhkis> ?g w3fools
[10:48:07] <b-ot> Uhkis: W3Fools – Better web education for all → http://www.w3fools.com/
[10:48:10] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[10:48:22] <Talow> lol
[10:48:37] <Uhkis> :-)
[10:50:13] <Talow> I'm using jquery sortable with a UL I want to set it to change the value of a hidden input when the user changes the order of the list to reflect the change. How would I do this, or is there a better way?
[10:50:40] <robertmaxrees> Talow do you have a fiddle or similar started?
[10:50:44] <BillCriswell> Talow: A better way than?
[10:52:11] <BillCriswell> Talow: http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#event-change is probably the event you want.
[10:52:22] <Talow> better way than using the hidden input to return the value
[10:52:50] <Talow> robbyoconnor: fiddle, never hurd of it
[10:53:04] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete, and jsfiddle.net
[10:53:09] <robertmaxrees> great for test cases :)
[10:53:18] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, BillCriswell's suggestion is what you want.
[10:53:22] <BillCriswell> I thought you were using the hidden input for your own thing.. what are you doing with the hidden input?
[10:55:10] <Talow> wanting to return the information via my forum to drupal when the user clicks save
[10:55:23] <Talow> Figured it'd be easiest with the hidden input type
[10:57:38] <BillCriswell> You can update a hidden input on the change event, there's a $('#sortable').sortable('serialize') method that'll make populating that easy. If you need something a little more advanced there's a $('#sortable').sortable('toArray', function (item) { return item.whatever; });
[10:58:48] <Talow> I think the 2nd option may be what I'm after.
[10:58:58] <Talow> Thanks much that will help drasticly.
[10:59:35] <BillCriswell> I may actually be doing that wrong.
[10:59:39] <BillCriswell> going to try and dig up an example.
[11:00:03] <Talow> I'll start with the serialize and see what I get out of it
[11:00:15] <Talow> if it's not what I want I'll move on to the toarray option
[11:02:21] <BillCriswell> remysharp: Is there a secret search option in jsbin by any chance? Or an obvious one? I am not very observant.
[11:04:44] <BillCriswell> Talow: http://jsbin.com/qofapi/8/edit?js,output It would just be .sortable('toArray', { attribute: 'foo' });
[11:08:57] <Talow> BillCriswell thanks :D
[11:27:01] <Talow> okay I've done http://jsfiddle.net/qjg1pqk5/ to try to get the info (and verify what that info is. I'm running this on a localhost so i can't show the whole thing but the info I'm getting back is only [object Object]
[11:27:16] <Talow> I'm guessing I have an issue with my access but I don't see it.
[11:28:17] <Talow> sorry updated to put the entire function on there :S
[11:29:41] <Talow> http://jsfiddle.net/qjg1pqk5/1/
[11:31:43] <Talow> oh nevermind, I think I figured it out
[11:38:43] <AliG1000> Hello.  How can I open a popup box if I hover for 2 seconds, but do nothing if I hover for less than 2 seconds?  I am close-ish but not quite there: http://pastebin.com/JisYMhAD
[11:39:01] <robertmaxrees> AliG1000 just use hoverintent :)
[11:39:46] <AliG1000> can I do this without hoverintent?
[11:40:40] <robertmaxrees> sure, but there's no reason not to use it.
[11:40:42] <robertmaxrees> it's 153 lines.
[11:41:13] <AliG1000> ok - I'll give it a go.  I just figure that the code I had was almost there - bot not quite
[11:52:48] <ashopin> Hello all. I need a bit of help figuring out why my if statement doesn't seem to make a difference. It's a very simple piece of code to show a modal on a form if the required fields are completed. http://pastebin.com/DjgK8tdc When I put the if statement in console in my browser, it works: shows the modal only if the required fields are completed. In practice, the modal shows regardless.
[11:54:00] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you slap console.log(jQuery('.required').length); before that if statement?
[11:54:40] <ashopin> robertmaxrees: it returns the number of required fields I have.
[11:54:59] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  can you create a simplified fiddle to replicate then?
[11:55:10] <ashopin> Yup, one sec.
[11:59:03] <ashopin> robertmaxrees. Unfortunately, it's not the best example because it's part of Drupal site that adds the 'error' class when required fields aren't completed. http://jsfiddle.net/rbeajdwm/
[11:59:25] <robertmaxrees> bu this shows the issue happen, right?
[12:00:02] <ashopin> No :/ it works here.
[12:00:07] <robertmaxrees> err.
[12:00:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:00:12] <robertmaxrees> kind of hard to help then.
[12:00:22] <ashopin> haha ya hard to diagnose as well!
[12:00:47] <robertmaxrees> i'd pull out a debuggerthem.
[12:01:22] <ashopin> I have a feeling it's because of Drupal.
[12:01:26] <ashopin> Thanks for the help though
[12:01:27] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[12:01:31] <ashopin> robertmaxrees++
[12:01:33] <robertmaxrees> not sure - that's why we have debuggers :D
[12:03:09] <pauled> Please help me to debug this: http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/wn21zm68/ is to get a console.log output if 1. the checkbox is checked and value in dropdown is selected. 2. if checkbox is selected but dropdown value is blank (null) http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/wn21zm68/
[12:03:35] <pauled> is to/is supposed to*
[12:03:45] <robertmaxrees> pauled you don't need firebug lite btw.
[12:03:57] <robertmaxrees> your browser has built-in tools.
[12:04:47] <pauled> but my browser build-in is detached, and after refresh I have to always select the frame
[12:05:08] <robertmaxrees> no you don't.  the console logs should bubble up just fine.
[12:05:35] <robertmaxrees> also: you're mixing up variables.  which chk0isChked do you care about?
[12:05:45] <pauled> no, example if I have to type something, I have to select the frale
[12:05:46] <robertmaxrees> the one at the beginning, or the one in setThenMonitorCheckboxState ?
[12:07:15] <pauled> which line number?
[12:07:29] <robertmaxrees> the variable chk0isChked
[12:07:46] <robertmaxrees> ctrl+f and find it in your code :)
[12:09:13] <pauled> hmm I don't know which I have to care lol ^^
[12:09:31] <robertmaxrees> i see you setting that variable in two different places.
[12:09:37] <robertmaxrees> which one are you trying to read in the if statement?
[12:11:03] <pauled> var chk0isChked = chk0.prop('checked'); it read the property if checked?
[12:11:12] <robertmaxrees> right.  see the other place you set that?
[12:11:31] <robertmaxrees> also: chk0isChked won't "update" automatically for you.
[12:13:19] <pauled> hmm I am puzzled now, when I type: var chk0 = $('#isautoberserk'); var chk0isChked = chk0.prop('checked'); the output is "undefined"
[12:13:51] <pauled> maybe prop is not what is excepted
[12:14:02] <Puck6633> I think it's attr()
[12:14:08] <robertmaxrees> nope, it's prop
[12:14:17] <robertmaxrees> they're confusing themselves bigtime though.
[12:14:30] <pauled> but in that link it's prop yes http://stackoverflow.com/a/19129181
[12:16:46] <robertmaxrees> pauled btw, what's up with that setTimeout()?
[12:17:12] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:18:17] <pauled> you torture me there :)
[12:19:20] <robertmaxrees> you realize everything in setThenMonitorCheckboxState() is happening later than everything else, right?
[12:19:39] <pauled> it call setThenMonitorCheckboxState after 333 secondes I guess
[12:19:44] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:20:13] <pauled> but why? I don't know!
[12:20:19] <robertmaxrees> you see the problem with that, right?
[12:21:41] <pauled> nope, because in localstorage it's instantaneous updated
[12:21:51] <robertmaxrees> but it's not.
[12:21:58] <robertmaxrees> that code runs after 333 milliseconds.
[12:22:03] <robertmaxrees> so it fires after everything else.
[12:23:52] <pauled> I don't get it, I see dev tool > Resources > Local Storage the values are instantaneous updated
[12:23:59] <robertmaxrees> almost instantaneously.
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> that code does a lot of other stuff.
[12:24:35] <robertmaxrees> like it's setting the checkboxes you want to read.
[12:24:54] <pauled> there is only 2 keys RatingDiff and isautoberserk
[12:25:04] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* right and you read those on pageload.
[12:25:34] <robertmaxrees> you're asking aboutt eh if statements - they aren't working the way you think they are.
[12:25:44] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wn21zm68/21/
[12:25:46] <robertmaxrees> for example.
[12:27:08] <Talow> http://output.jsbin.com/junayiqago/5/edit?html,js,console,output My array is not returning the current order of my sorted list, or all the items in it.
[12:27:37] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[12:27:39] <pauled> robertmaxrees: I have to if on chk0wasChked instead?
[12:27:52] <robertmaxrees> pauled i feel like you're messign with me dude...
[12:28:06] <robertmaxrees> are you even looking at the console?
[12:28:24] <pauled> I see false on every statement
[12:28:34] <robertmaxrees> you have if (chk0isChked && berserk.length && diff0wasSel !== null) { - that will only pass if each of those values is "true"
[12:28:42] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you one that is not.
[12:29:07] <robertmaxrees> Talow you don't want to use an iterator there.
[12:29:22] <robertmaxrees> Talow http://api.jquery.com/each/ start with this.
[12:29:40] <pauled> ok, I need sleep then
[12:29:56] <robertmaxrees> pauled you really need to read a tutorial about jhavascript.
[12:29:59] <Talow> robbyoconnor: okay...
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> you've been having the same basic problems over and over.
[12:30:11] <robertmaxrees> Talow bad autocomplete ;)
[12:30:21] <robertmaxrees> Talow also, what are you trying to do here?
[12:30:24] <Talow> robertmaxrees sorry
[12:31:08] <Talow> Attempting to get this list to return it's current value and order to a hidden field so that i can then have drupal save it.
[12:34:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah you have a lot of code errors in here.  that might be causing some of your headaches.
[12:34:24] <Talow> code errors?
[12:34:38] <robertmaxrees> for loops don't work correctly on jquery objects.
[12:34:44] <robertmaxrees> undeclared variables.
[12:34:55] <robertmaxrees> etc
[12:35:39] <Talow> robertmaxrees you mean me?
[12:35:45] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:35:49] <Talow> I don't see that
[12:35:52] <robertmaxrees> I do.
[12:35:57] <robertmaxrees> i see 2 for loops.
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> which you don't want in this case.
[12:36:11] <robertmaxrees> i see variables you use before you declare them.
[12:36:35] <Talow> yeah I'm still new to JS, my main background is with C#
[12:36:39] <Talow> x.x
[12:36:46] <robertmaxrees> it's all good. let me show you an example.
[12:36:51] <Talow> C# would yell at me and I'd fix it
[12:37:04] <robertmaxrees> js is very forgiving.
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> get a linter if you can.
[12:37:27] <Talow> I'm useing DW for my coding here
[12:37:46] <robertmaxrees> DW?
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> oh, dreamweaver?
[12:37:50] <Talow> yes
[12:37:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:37:54] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[12:38:04] <Talow> yeah I know there's better for this
[12:38:12] <Talow> but it's what I have currently
[12:39:02] <pauled> there is no a w3fool like for dw ? ;)
[12:39:27] <robertmaxrees> pauled DW is so rarely used any more and so widely know to be bad that it's kind of a given.
[12:40:26] <Talow> yeah, I'm knowingly using it that way cuz it has things set up and I can't change it on this pc :(
[12:40:34] <Talow> stupid boss
[12:40:46] <Talow> so it's DW of NP
[12:40:52] <Talow> not NP++ but NP
[12:40:53] <robertmaxrees> "of np"?
[12:40:58] <Talow> notepad
[12:40:58] <robertmaxrees> oh OR notepad
[12:41:09] <Talow> yes or*
[12:41:20] <robertmaxrees> so first off: http://output.jsbin.com/junayiqago/5/edit?html,js,console,output
[12:41:27] <robertmaxrees> see the ,each() in there?
[12:41:49] <pauled> I saw someone coding with the IDE from microsoft
[12:41:58] <robertmaxrees> Visual Studio is fantastic.
[12:42:03] <Talow> ^
[12:42:12] <Talow> just wish they would let me install it, even express
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> what about sublime text?
[12:42:35] <Talow> robertmaxrees: I think you pasted the wrong link
[12:42:45] <robertmaxrees> gah
[12:42:47] <robertmaxrees> i hate jsbin.
[12:43:02] <Talow> They won't let me install anything boss says "I paid for DW you better well use it."
[12:43:12] <robertmaxrees> your boss is frankly an idiot.
[12:43:12] <Talow> stupid boss
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/vuyugajudi/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> try this?
[12:44:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's what you want.
[12:44:44] <pauled> robertmaxrees: yes visual studio, I did not know that it was practical to code in JS, anyway I find it very complicated. I had tried to build a program written in C
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> VS is great, you just have to learn the tool.
[12:45:03] <Talow> robertmaxrees: .each is better than for why?
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> Talow for loops are genearally not what you want.
[12:45:34] <robertmaxrees> in your case, you were trying to loop over a jquery object - that's not an actual array.
[12:45:54] <Talow> I see
[12:45:57] <robertmaxrees> also, you wanted to go through each item in the object and do something, not count.
[12:46:20] <robertmaxrees> your other for loop - up in fill() - is the only legitimate use case for a for loop.
[12:46:36] <Talow> because I'm creating on the count
[12:46:45] <robertmaxrees> *because you need to count, period.
[12:46:52] <robertmaxrees> any time you're working with arrays, you don't need a for loop.
[12:46:54] <Talow> alright I see.
[12:47:16] <Talow> That works for the set up
[12:47:18] <robertmaxrees> anyway, jquery gives you an each method - see the difference?  heckuva lot cleaner.
[12:47:25] <Talow> yep
[12:47:33] <robertmaxrees> also, you want stop, not change for the event
[12:47:44] <Talow> stop?
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/kexotaziho/2/edit
[12:48:19] <Talow> so my code was right, just in the wrong event?
[12:48:28] <robertmaxrees> ish.
[12:48:34] <robertmaxrees> you also had the initializer in the wrong place.
[12:48:36] <Talow> I'll take ish.
[12:48:44] <robertmaxrees> don't take "ish" with JS.
[12:48:48] <Uhkis> fish!
[12:49:16] <robertmaxrees> just because it works doesn't mean it's valid - things that cause compilation/runtime errors in other languages are just sort of glossed over by JS>
[12:49:17] <Talow> I ment that my code was right ish, not right
[12:50:14] <Talow> So the stop is when the list has finished changing and the list is ready to give the correct array?
[12:50:27] <robertmaxrees> basically, yeah.
[12:50:36] <robertmaxrees> when the user has dropped the thing they're dragging.
[12:50:56] <Talow> That's when I want it to pull the array
[12:51:02] <Talow> thanks that helps
[12:51:29] <Talow> I get the var init, I get the for loop, and the stop....
[12:51:34] <Talow> one last question....
[12:51:56] <Talow> how can I make it so the array takes the date-id as the key and the value of the list item as it's value?
[12:53:29] <robertmaxrees> don't use an array.
[12:53:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a little harder.
[12:54:32] <robertmaxrees> do you wnat key/value pairs, like a hash?  or an array whose objects are key/value pairs.
[12:55:48] <Talow> in c# it would be accessed like data[0]
[12:55:54] <Talow> in JS i have no idea
[12:56:04] <robertmaxrees> what would you get back from data[0] ?
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> a name and a value?
[12:56:52] <sadtaco> It's data[0] for both array and hash
[12:56:57] <Talow> data would be the array, 0 would be the key, and the value would be
[12:56:58] <sadtaco> assuming the key is 0 in the hash case
[12:57:06] <Talow> what is set to data[0]
[12:57:15] <robertmaxrees> Talow then you already have that.
[12:57:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what this is.
[12:57:23] <robertmaxrees> an array.
[12:57:52] <Talow> .... then it's formated wrong for me I guess...
[12:58:32] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:58:36] <Talow> I'm looking to have the data-id as the key for the array [0]...[12]... and the value of the key be what's inside the list item
[12:58:52] <Talow> so 1 or &nbsp;
[12:58:57] <Talow> in this case
[12:59:16] <robertmaxrees> right, an array.
[12:59:22] <robertmaxrees> oh, wait.
[12:59:28] <robertmaxrees> &nbsp; as a key?
[12:59:33] <Talow> no as the value
[12:59:37] <robertmaxrees> derp my bad.
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's what you have here.
[12:59:54] <Talow> ["1", "2", "0", "3", "4"]
[12:59:58] <Talow> that's the output
[13:00:35] <robertmaxrees> oh, right - you need to use another attribute.
[13:00:53] <robertmaxrees> and stuff whatever data you want as the value in there.
[13:00:56] <sadtaco> array[0] would be "1"
[13:01:03] <Talow> yeah I need to save the order (it is now) and the value
[13:01:16] <sadtaco> Why aren't you using a hash instead of array?
[13:01:26] <robertmaxrees> because hashes don't have an order.
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> only arrays do.
[13:01:33] <sadtaco> Ah
[13:01:42] <robertmaxrees> he needs to save the order of things.
[13:01:44] <sadtaco> To be fair though, in modern browsers they do :P
[13:01:51] <sadtaco> Even though spec doesn't say it needs one
[13:01:52] <robertmaxrees> i would never rely on it.
[13:01:54] <sadtaco> Aye
[13:02:20] <sadtaco> For server side you can. Heh.
[13:02:29] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:02:43] <Talow> php would yes, would be easy to make the object pointers
[13:02:44] <robertmaxrees> i never would unless i'm using ES7 with my own iterator.
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> err, es6
[13:02:52] <billybob00> how come this doesn't work?
[13:02:56] <billybob00> $( ".smoke-stack-test-result" )[0].find("#suite-uuid").text()
[13:03:09] <robertmaxrees> billybob00 because [0] gets the raw dom node.
[13:03:11] <billybob00> suite-uuid is a child element of that div
[13:03:13] <robertmaxrees> you want .eq(0) instead.
[13:06:47] <Talow> how would I make the array hold objects of data-id and item-value, where data-id is the data id attrabute and item-value is the stuff inside the <li></li>?
[13:07:22] <robertmaxrees> you can't unless you build it custom.
[13:07:35] <Talow> x.x
[13:07:38] <SuperTyp> I use the validator plugin (http://jqueryvalidation.org/) how can I use it with event delegation using the .on() function?
[13:07:57] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp are you adding fields after the page loads that you want to validate?
[13:08:21] <SuperTyp> this is what I tried so far: http://pastie.org/10201108
[13:08:36] <robertmaxrees> ... could you maybe answer the question?
[13:08:46] <SuperTyp> sure just typing :)
[13:09:02] <SuperTyp> I add a form after another form was submitted
[13:09:13] <robertmaxrees> and that's why you're using the delegation?
[13:09:17] <SuperTyp> yes
[13:09:18] <sadtaco> No, I'm talking about server side javascript. Nodejs, for example.
[13:09:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah, not how that works.
[13:09:27] <sadtaco> How the VM runs is predictable.
[13:09:34] <robertmaxrees> you need to initialialize the validator first.
[13:09:43] <robertmaxrees> sadtaco i'd still never rely on it.
[13:09:55] <robertmaxrees> just because the VM does something today doens't mean it won't change.
[13:12:19] <Lencl> hello
[13:12:45] <Lencl> im having an issue where an .on() is being called twice
[13:13:32] <robertmaxrees> are you binding it twice?
[13:14:22] <Lencl> I call on ajax that populates <div> items.. then I bind them. Then I hide those div items.. then I call ajax again and populate other div items. It also binds those div items... but when I .show() the previous hidden div's, it gets called twice
[13:14:39] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're doing it in an ajax call.
[13:14:42] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that.
[13:14:46] <Lencl> oh
[13:14:54] <robertmaxrees> it's re-binding.
[13:14:57] <Lencl> should I use "onclick" ?
[13:14:57] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[13:15:50] <robertmaxrees> check out http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[13:16:12] <Lencl> ah yes that looks good thank you
[13:18:00] <hlvwrk> Heyo.... how would I go about setting a var based on an elements CSS property?
[13:18:27] <hlvwrk> var elCSS = $('.fs1 div span:first-child').css("content");   spits out an empty var
[13:19:13] <robertmaxrees> is thjat a good selector?
[13:19:25] <hlvwrk> yep
[13:19:38] <hlvwrk> content should be "\ef9c"
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> hrmm
[13:20:30] <robertmaxrees> oh...
[13:20:37] <robertmaxrees> content's only available on psuedo elements.
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> you can't access those using jquery.
[13:21:02] <hlvwrk> Ahhh
[13:22:23] <hlvwrk> $('.fs1 span:first-child').addClass('textSpan');
[13:22:23] <hlvwrk> var elCSS = $('.textSpan').css("content");
[13:22:24] <hlvwrk> ??
[13:22:33] <hlvwrk> lol.
[13:22:33] <robertmaxrees> again.
[13:22:38] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:22:41] <hlvwrk> oh wait
[13:22:45] <hlvwrk> i'm dumb.
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> content is only available on psuedo elements.
[13:22:47] <hlvwrk> hmm
[13:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you cannot access psuedo elements with jquery.
[13:24:05] <hlvwrk> you can't modify them as they're not in the dom but ... you should be able to read them?
[13:24:27] <robertmaxrees> you can't read them for the same reason.
[13:24:53] <hlvwrk> hmph.
[13:25:06] <hlvwrk> also not available through JS?
[13:25:18] <robertmaxrees> correcty.
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> because it's not in the DOM.
[13:25:28] <hlvwrk> hmph
[13:25:32] <hlvwrk> damnit.
[13:25:54] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't be using content for anything actually meaningful fwiw.
[13:26:35] <Lencl> robertmaxrees is this correct? $( "#mixnmatch" ).on( "click", "ul li.word", wordClicked);     For <div id="mixnmatch"> <ul> <li class="word"></li></ul> </div>
[13:26:53] <robertmaxrees> i'd ditch the element on that class.
[13:26:57] <robertmaxrees> but that should work.
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> just do .word
[13:27:28] <hlvwrk> robertmaxrees, font icons yo
[13:27:39] <robertmaxrees> hlvwrk why are you retrieving them via jquery?
[13:28:25] <hlvwrk> eh kinda hard to explain. I'm trying to update a huge list of them for a help doc. I wanted to put the unicode char in the second column
[13:28:38] <Talow> robertmaxrees: using the each(function(){ how can I access the jquery object of the element it's currently on?
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> Talow $(this)
[13:28:57] <Talow> robertmaxrees: ty again
[13:29:29] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/each/ - "...the callback is fired in the context of the current DOM element, so the keyword this refers to the element."
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> any time you get a DOM element in jquery, you just wrap it in $()
[13:29:55] <Lencl> wooow it worked, jquery is EASY
[13:30:13] <pauled> good night! robertmaxrees :)
[13:36:22] <Talow> $(".sortable").sortable({stop: function() { $(this).each(function(){ console.log($(this).attr("data-id")); }); } } ); returns undefined where am I going wrong?
[13:36:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this) isn't what you think it is there  :)
[13:37:15] <Talow> okay... how do I access what I want then?
[13:37:17] <robertmaxrees> if anything, it's referring to the sortable itself, not the individual items in it.
[13:37:38] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('li') or whatever kind of element you're sorting.
[13:37:45] <robertmaxrees> also: use data for data attributes - .data('id')
[13:41:41] <Lencl> I have two event delegations: $( "#mixnmatch" ).on( "click", "ul .word", wordClicked);   $( "#mixnmatch" ).on( "click", "ul .def", defClicked);
[13:41:47] <Lencl> the second one is binding twice o.O
[13:41:53] <Lencl> is it because I can have two under the same id?
[13:41:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:41:59] <robertmaxrees> something else is wrong.
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see an example.
[13:42:22] <Lencl> hmm okay I'll try to invetigate
[13:42:42] <robertmaxrees>  $( "#mixnmatch" ).on( "click", ".word", wordClicked); - btw do this.
[13:42:45] <robertmaxrees> no need for the ul.
[13:42:51] <Lencl> ah ok
[13:45:46] <Lencl> is there a way to console.log() upon an element getting binded?
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> sorta?
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:47:18] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/gey8ug7/
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[13:48:54] <Lencl> ahh nice
[13:48:59] <Lencl> so it shows bound only once
[13:49:06] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[13:49:07] <Lencl> yet when clicked, called twice
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle?
[13:49:24] <robertmaxrees> or show the page where it's happening?
[13:49:25] <Lencl> ok ill try
[13:55:25] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: did you mean it like this? http://pastie.org/10201196
[13:55:32] <SuperTyp> :>
[13:55:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:55:57] <robertmaxrees> you said you're replacing the form via ajax, right?
[13:56:29] <SuperTyp> yes
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> that won't work then.
[13:56:37] <SuperTyp> jquery mobile
[13:56:43] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't wait for the ajax to finish running.
[13:56:44] <Talow> robertmaxrees can you check this and tell me what you think of my solution? http://jsbin.com/lisiwosulo/11/edit?js,console,output
[13:57:17] <SuperTyp> so I put the function in .complete?
[13:57:26] <robertmaxrees> or .done()
[13:57:30] <robertmaxrees> Talow one sec.
[13:57:40] <robertmaxrees> so first, don't do var ret = Array();
[13:57:46] <robertmaxrees> use an array literal for that = [];
[13:58:08] <robertmaxrees> also, you actually want http://api.jquery.com/map/
[13:59:34] <Talow> the map is too disjointed for me to understand, can you show me an example?
[13:59:43] <robertmaxrees> what's disjointed about it?
[13:59:44] <SuperTyp> .pageContainer() uses ajax to change the page if it's a external URL right?
[14:00:04] <Talow> my eyes are not able to keep up with the () and {} on the same line
[14:00:35] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:00:37] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty simple.
[14:00:52] <Talow> I'm likely getting tired
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> you're jsut passing objects to functions.  that's all.
[14:01:14] <Talow> ah
[14:01:23] <robertmaxrees> and actually, functions ARE objects.
[14:01:39] <Talow> yeah, lets not confuzzle me
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> anyway - http://jsbin.com/lipodomima/1/edit?js,console,output
[14:02:53] <Talow> yeah I wouldn't have tried it that way but it works well. Thanks much again.
[14:03:19] <Talow> I think I can now get this to work with my drupal code.
[14:03:20] <robertmaxrees> that's really want you want to do, either way.
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> map from one thing to another :)
[14:15:03] <Talow> robertmaxrees Thank you, I was able to turn my array into a jsonstring and now I will be able to set the field with it and then drupal can save it, I'll then be able to get the values with php and play with it as needed. TY SO MUCH!
[14:32:54] <htdocs_> hello. I have this site shine9.us/wpp and in the main navbar you will seee a dropdown menu. but the dropdown appearing speed is slow I want it to be little faster. how can I do this ?
[14:37:28] <robertmaxrees> htdocs_ you mean the about link ooor...?
[14:37:50] <htdocs_> yeah
[14:38:04] <htdocs_> mean when hover and the dropdown appears.
[14:38:17] <htdocs_> but the current appearance is slow I want it to be little faster
[14:38:53] <SuperTyp> is that wordpress?
[14:39:00] <htdocs_> yah
[14:39:10] <robertmaxrees> and i'll guess you have no idea where the code is that controls that?
[14:39:43] <htdocs_> it is controling by the javascript and no idea that where to go and fix this
[14:39:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:39:51] <robertmaxrees> okjay
[14:40:56] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: In drupal you have modules where you can configure that, is there something similar in wp?
[14:41:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't use wordpress soi have no idea.
[14:42:49] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's in the theme's js
[14:42:57] <robertmaxrees> theme_trust.js
[14:43:16] <robertmaxrees> jQuery('ul.sf-menu').superfish(); - need to configure it during this init: http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/options/
[14:44:03] <htdocs_> robertmaxrees: me ?
[14:44:08] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:44:24] <SuperTyp> htdocs_: go to your admin page and see if you have superfish plugin installed
[14:44:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:45:05] <htdocs_> no we don't have this plugin
[14:45:12] <robertmaxrees> it's on the page.
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> regardless.
[14:45:32] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to edit that file i showed you.
[14:46:31] <SuperTyp> htdocs_: you bought the trust theme right?
[14:46:41] <htdocs_> yea
[14:46:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to edit theme_trust.js in the theme.
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> i'd save a backup and edit a new version.
[14:48:46] <htdocs_> I do but the delay is still there
[14:48:52] <robertmaxrees> how did you change it?
[14:49:07] <htdocs_> in theme_trust.js I do
[14:49:08] <htdocs_> $.fn.superfish.defaults = { 		popUpSelector: 'ul,.sf-mega', // within menu context 		hoverClass: 'sfHover', 		pathClass: 'overrideThisToUse', 		pathLevels: 1, 		delay: 1, 		animation: {opacity: 'show'}, 		animationOut: {opacity: 'hide'}, 		speed: 'normal', 		speedOut: 'fast', 		cssArrows: true, 		disableHI: false, 		onInit: $.noop, 		onBeforeShow: $.noop, 		onShow: $.noop, 		onBeforeHide: $.noop, 		onHide: $.noop, 		onIdle: $.noop, 		on
[14:49:34] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you do that...
[14:49:35] <htdocs_> $.fn.superfish.defaults = { 		popUpSelector: 'ul,.sf-mega',		hoverClass: 'sfHover', 		pathClass: 'overrideThisToUse', 		pathLevels: 1, 		delay: 1, 		animation: {opacity: 'show'}, 		animationOut: {opacity: 'hide'}, 		speed: 'normal', 		speedOut: 'fast', 		cssArrows: true, 		disableHI: false, 		onInit: $.noop, 		onBeforeShow: $.noop, 		onShow: $.noop, 		onBeforeHide: $.noop, 		onHide: $.noop, 		onIdle: $.noop, 		onDestroy: $.noop 	};
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> please stop pasting that.
[14:49:46] <htdocs_> okay
[14:49:56] <SuperTyp> !pastecode
[14:49:57] <htdocs_> is it not allowed to share code /

[14:50:05] <robertmaxrees> instead of spamming the channel.
[14:50:12] <htdocs_> okay
[14:50:20] <robertmaxrees> you didn't even read the docs.
[14:50:22] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: whats the command for that?
[14:50:33] <robertmaxrees> i just did it SuperTyp - !paste
[14:50:53] <htdocs_> now http://pastebin.com/Leh61P4h
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> htdocs_ see where you have the line jQuery('ul.sf-menu').superfish(); in theme_trust.js
[14:51:07] <SuperTyp> thx
[14:51:32] <robertmaxrees> htdocs_ not the superfish file.  theme_trust.js
[14:52:25] <robertmaxrees> welp
[14:53:04] <htdocs_> theme_trust.js file is http://pastebin.com/4UWpH4ww
[14:53:18] <robertmaxrees> right, see the line that says jQuery('ul.sf-menu').superfish(); ?
[14:53:47] <robertmaxrees> (i can see that file just fine - you don't need to share it btw ;) )
[14:55:16] <htdocs_> yeah
[14:55:28] <robertmaxrees> replace that line with fixee.org/paste/8yjxdie/
[14:55:29] <htdocs_> but I don't understand javascript/jqueyr
[14:55:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm practically fixing it for you.
[14:55:39] <robertmaxrees> fyi.
[14:55:54] <htdocs_> okay thank you
[14:56:24] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees++
[14:56:55] <htdocs_> rebertmaxrees. thanks
[14:57:00] <robertmaxrees> did that fix it?
[14:57:06] <htdocs_> now it is set
[14:57:11] <htdocs_> again thanks
[14:57:41] <SuperTyp> htdocs_: FYI you bought the theme with money, it seems like you are not a dev, so contact the support and they'll help you out with stuff like that
[14:57:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:58:09] <htdocs_> right
[15:03:23] <mEck0> I want to build a site where the user can change color on specific parts of a shoe, pretty much like http://www.vans.com/shop/custom-shoes?productId=p_20333&page=configure&audience=men Can it be accomplished with jquery or what is the preferred way? HTML canvas?
[15:03:45] <robertmaxrees> right click -> inspect
[15:03:47] <robertmaxrees> it shows you there :)
[15:06:22] <mEck0> If I see correct this solution uses HTML canvas and javascript but no jquery
[15:06:33] <robertmaxrees> fwiw jquery IS javascript.
[15:06:37] <robertmaxrees> and it's using an image map here.
[15:07:19] <robertmaxrees> you could do something like that with canvas if you wanted.  lots of choices.
[15:07:38] <drej> really robertmaxrees
[15:07:41] <drej> REALLY?
[15:07:47] <robertmaxrees> Whaaaaaat?!
[15:08:36] <mEck0> robertmaxrees: okay, thanks so far. I need to analyze the code a bit to understand how it works in a whole
[15:09:58] <converge> Im looking for a fancy slider, does anyone knows one ?
[15:10:14] <robertmaxrees> "slider" as in carousel, or "slider" as is the form control?

[15:12:40] <SuperTyp> 	
[15:12:42] <robertmaxrees> woah stop duder
[15:12:58] <robertmaxrees> that usually means you're miussing something.
[15:13:33] <deepy> robertmaxrees: brilliant website
[15:13:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd like to think so, deepy
[15:14:06] <converge> robertmaxrees: nice
[15:14:22] <SuperTyp> I can't see whats missing...http://pastie.org/10201280
[15:15:00] <robertmaxrees> you have a rule that isn't defined, SuperTyp
[15:15:29] <SuperTyp> is it the extension?
[15:15:34] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:15:52] <SuperTyp> extension: "xls|csv|pdf|doc|docx|ppt|txt" ?
[15:15:56] <SuperTyp> or what do you mean?
[15:16:12] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery validate TypeError: $.validator.methods[method] is undefined
[15:16:13] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: TypeError: $.validator.methods[method] is undefined - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20774885/typeerror-validator-methodsmethod-is-undefined
[15:16:20] <robertmaxrees> ^ search google.  that'll help you much more.
[15:16:30] <robertmaxrees> but basically it means you're missing a validation rule that you're trying to use.
[15:17:04] <robertmaxrees> be aware that some of the "Default" rules aren't actually included - you have to download a separate file to get them.
[15:17:08] <SuperTyp> bro, I do google always before I ask
[15:17:29] <SuperTyp> and I was on that SO Q already, but I don't see anything wrong in my config
[15:17:35] <robertmaxrees> whatevs mang.  telling you things to look for.
[15:17:50] <robertmaxrees> make sure you actually have the code for the rules included.
[15:17:55] <SuperTyp> that might be
[15:18:05] <SuperTyp> because the required rule is ok
[15:18:11] <SuperTyp> but the extension one not
[15:18:30] <SuperTyp> so the extension rule isn't even checked when the required rule isn't true
[15:18:31] <robertmaxrees> do you have the extras file from jqvalidate included oin the page oir whatever?
[15:18:51] <SuperTyp> no let me see if its that
[15:18:54] <SuperTyp> good point thanks
[15:23:54] <SuperTyp> that did the trick
[15:24:14] <SuperTyp> additional-methods.js was missing
[15:29:58] <SuperTyp> I know that the validation function already brings the submit event handler
[15:30:40] <SuperTyp> but when I put the validation inside the .on function with submit as event, I need to double click the submit button to submit the form.
[15:30:48] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:30:59] <SuperTyp> my fix replacing the submit event with click failed
[15:31:02] <SuperTyp> any ideas?
[15:31:19] <SuperTyp> why I do the .on?
[15:46:15] <vivekananda> hello everyone.
[15:47:22] <SuperTyp> hello
[15:48:17] <vivekananda> A question. I have a .keyup(). I trigger it after a delay ( 3000ms). Current issue is if I enter something wrong and then KEEP backspace depressed , it deletes the item. But , if I press backspace multiple times quickly then first keypress hangs the page and the second time just makes the browser go back a page !!!
[15:48:53] <vivekananda> It works fine otherwise. Is this expected ? Also how do I solve this ?
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> you need a debounce for the handler.
[15:49:05] <robertmaxrees> not the event
[15:49:49] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, have no clue what is meant by what you just said :)
[15:50:03] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript debounce
[15:50:03] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript Debounce Function - David Walsh → http://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function
[15:50:15] <vivekananda> ok lemme read
[15:50:43] <vivekananda> nice link
[15:52:02] <vivekananda> like it!! lemme try to implement it . But before that, is this expected behaviour. I was reading somewhere that backspace and special keys are not trapped by keyup. I am thinking even if I use debounce still the problem isn't solved coz what I want is for the keyup not trap keys like backspace and enter
[15:52:12] <vivekananda> hmmm on second thoughts I might want to trap enter !!
[15:52:29] <robertmaxrees> how about you show your code.
[15:52:38] <robertmaxrees> because something tells me you're handling it incorrectly.
[15:56:37] <Primero> hi
[15:57:05] <Primero> somebody have experiencie with handsontable?
[15:58:27] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, I think you are right . okay here is the code -- https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/559a19ef3f658e0af4ae
[15:58:46] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, same as the afternoon one . though I made some changes ( reshuffling)
[15:59:00] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, box 1 not 2
[16:02:37] <drej> my fav part of that is //console.log("hellllloo1111111111");
[16:03:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:03:31] <robertmaxrees> uuuuuh
[16:03:42] <robertmaxrees> so where's the specific event binding?
[16:03:51] <robertmaxrees> the one you want to debounce?
[16:04:39] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, if you want a demo I can show you that too :)
[16:04:41] <vivekananda> a live one
[16:04:52] <drej> can you provide a test case
[16:05:02] <drej> or alternatively, drive to robertmaxrees' house
[16:05:26] <vivekananda> drej, very tough. It would be difficult . I can show a demo with a tunneled link right here
[16:05:47] <vivekananda> that should be okay right ?
[16:05:51] <drej> generally no
[16:06:06] <drej> unless you pay him for his time
[16:06:28] <drej> but thats up to him
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda yeah that's a little.. much.
[16:06:55] <robertmaxrees> you really should setup an isolated test case.
[16:06:58] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about your app.
[16:07:07] <robertmaxrees> you should do JUST the event binding part.
[16:09:01] <vivekananda> drej, hmm okay. so I have 3 options. 1. show the code  2. create a fiddle 3. show the working code to show what the problem looks like actually. I have 1 and 3 and 2 will be tough to replicate.
[16:09:16] <vivekananda> so you are saying 1 and 3 are of no use so I have to get 2 ?
[16:09:56] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, in a nutshell i have tto bind the keyup function.
[16:10:09] <drej> vivekananda: its more about why irc exists
[16:10:21] <drej> these channels exist not to support YOU or individual people in doing their jobs for free
[16:10:26] <drej> they exist so that the community learns as a hole
[16:10:37] <drej> if the only way you can show you problem is for robertmaxrees to go and do some skype session with you
[16:10:53] <decx> teamviewer even
[16:10:56] <drej> that defeats the purpose of this room in providing a scenario where other people can learn from those mistakes
[16:11:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:11:05] <robertmaxrees> this every day.
[16:11:42] <robertmaxrees> it's all about abstraction.  you need to break the problem down into its parts and think about it that way - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/wp38n31m/
[16:11:51] <ilhami> how do I specify the fields I want in my DataTable ?
[16:11:55] <vivekananda> decx, yep I understand. I am trying to figure how to bridge the gap between the problem I have and what irc can get me in terms of knowing more of the problem
[16:11:56] <ilhami> like from the json
[16:11:58] <robertmaxrees> "i need to bind a keyup event listener" - there's your test case for that.
[16:12:13] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda you need something more than that, keep building on that simple question.
[16:12:24] <robertmaxrees> what makes this particular listener special?
[16:14:47] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, also if you must know I based the code ( gist) on a fiddle I built. The fiddle doesn't have the keyup though . http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/28/  .
[16:15:04] <robertmaxrees> that has literally nothing to do with where we are now.
[16:15:07] <robertmaxrees> pair the problem down.
[16:15:09] <robertmaxrees> abstract it.
[16:16:05] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, well that function and the problematic one has just one differece ie I added a keyup to it
[16:16:12] <vivekananda> otherwise they are similar
[16:16:30] <robertmaxrees> great.  neiuther of them are reduced test cases and neither of them explain what you're having an issue with.
[16:17:43] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, btw I also have to learn to write test cases. I have not been doing this right and not doing TDD which I believe is a standard feature. I think I should start with that sooner than later. Though I am not sure if there is an easy way to write tests for js php apps which are not part of a framework
[16:18:05] <robertmaxrees> this has nothing to do with TDD.
[16:18:26] <quarters> hello
[16:18:39] <quarters> I was wondering how I can modify this code so as to indicate that I want the event handler to be triggered when the enter key specifically is keyupped (with the other events remaining in tact in the code): http://pastie.org/10201329
[16:18:44] <vivekananda> hmm . Okay lemme try this via regular debug methods and if that fails I will implement time to figure how to miniaturize the probleem
[16:19:36] <robertmaxrees> vivekananda http://fixingthesejquery.com/ - http://irc.jquery.org/irc-help/#asking-good-questions - https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[16:19:58] <robertmaxrees> quarters you want event.which
[16:20:06] <robertmaxrees> tht tells you which button it was.
[16:20:22] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, thanks
[16:21:42] <quarters> robertmaxrees: thank you.
[16:23:26] <quarters> robertmaxrees: would I duplicate the event handler for all of the events I'd want to act as triggers if I use event.wchih?
[16:23:50] <robertmaxrees> quarters nope.
[16:26:07] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, a question. Given a js function containing an ajax request with a .done() and .keyup(). Will the ajax always be called irrespective of what keys are entered ?  I just found that even after pressing backspace it is getting called
[16:26:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:28:33] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, oo and the js function is triggered by a autocomplete box when a key is pressed ( enter new letter ) like here -- http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories
[16:28:44] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[16:28:51] <robertmaxrees> your original question still doesn't m,ake sense.
[16:29:15] <robertmaxrees> you have a javascript function that runs a .keyUp() call and an ajax call?
[16:29:50] <vivekananda> no I have a js function that contains an ajax call which in turn has a .done() and a .keyup() ( both for the ajax call) .
[16:30:24] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:30:38] <vivekananda> umm nevermind.
[16:30:50] <robertmaxrees> show an example lol
[16:33:08] <robertmaxrees> iuf you're calling .keyUp() multiple times, that's bad btw.
[16:33:28] <ilhami> just call it once. :)
[16:34:04] <ilhami> .on('keyup', function() {}); is better
[16:34:06] <ilhami> :P
[16:36:11] <vivekananda> ilhami, hmmm.
[16:36:36] <vivekananda> robertmaxrees, keyup() was there to get a typeahead dropdown.
[16:46:18] <Talow> robertmaxrees++
[16:46:25] <Talow> Chow, and thanks again!
[16:46:30] <robertmaxrees> ciao sir
[17:04:57] <ilhami> do I need to return iTotalRecords from the server with the amount of rows for datatables to recognize the amount of entries in my table?
[17:18:00] <quarters> for some reason, the event handler isn't working properly: https://jsfiddle.net/cc20bxLp/
[17:18:53] <dubcat> hi. I have several DIV's with the same class. I want to 'detach' or 'remove' only the one that gets clicked on. I'm not sure how to distinguish that one from the other div's with the same name. Anyone point me in the right direction?
[17:19:12] <quarters> dubcat: $(this) I believe is what you want
[17:19:31] <quarters> within your click event handlerr
[17:19:36] <quarters> or on
[17:20:41] <dubcat> have tried that. $(this).detach(); nothing happens :(
[17:21:20] <dubcat> i know the mouseover event works because if i refer to the class rather than 'this'.. all div's with that class do disappear
[17:21:47] <dubcat> soon as i change it to $(this) rather than $(".click") the detach doesn't work
[17:25:51] <ilhami> seems like nobdoy wants to answer my question :/
[17:41:39] <dubcat> ahh i got it! if anyone wants to know just let me know
[17:55:19] <Dorf> what's the best way to pull several elements from one spot to another?
[17:57:54] <vivekananda> seeing a peculiar behavior. Everything else is working as expected. I type a word in the combo box and the autocomplete works. I start a search rotator graphic on keyup and end it after I get a result or an error ( ie after ajax). Now I see that if I delete the word and then key in exactly the same word in the search box then ajax isn't called !! Hence the graphic keeps rotating. Makes sense to anyone ? Can someone tell
[17:57:55] <vivekananda> me if this is expected ?
[17:58:14] <BillCriswell> Dorf: $('.items').appendTo('.foo'); (I think)
[17:58:46] <Dorf> i was thinking that, but i'd like to get an array of the items i want to move
[18:00:00] <BillCriswell> Dorf: That's what $('.items') would do.
[18:00:13] <BillCriswell> Dorf: http://jsbin.com/pexedo/1/edit?html,js,output
[18:23:22] <azx> How would i get to use the slideUp and slideDown function
[18:23:24] <azx> how can i detect
[18:23:27] <azx> when it is clicked once
[18:23:32] <azx> and when it is clicked again to slide up
[18:23:49] <azx> right now i have it set to display none on click and then display normal when clicked again
[18:24:13] <azx> and the only way its detecting that is through a for loop ("display" === "normal') else
[18:24:33] <azx> if i use slideUp and slideDown theres
[18:24:37] <azx> no data to hook onto
[18:25:14] <azx> ...
[18:25:15] <azx> I need to use slideUp and slide down in jQuery, how do i know the state of that slide
[18:31:00] <vivekananda> azx, I am not sure if this will help but http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/8Tbj3/17/  is something I made
[18:37:19] <azx> interesting, thank you
[18:37:27] <azx> i will try to incorportate something like this
[18:53:09] <bigmac> bootstrap, has not added a col-xxs- for smaller devices?
[18:54:08] <vivekananda> azx, no worries :)
[18:54:37] <bigmac> <480px
[18:55:38] <bigmac> i found a xs-B   <480px
[18:55:41] <bigmac> on github
[19:02:23] <oliverio> which jquery effect that flashes an element once?
[20:25:51] <mrtAkdeniz> hey there
[20:25:57] <mrtAkdeniz> http://jsfiddle.net/mrtakdeniz/ve415tLy/ any idea why only first one working?
[20:26:38] <mrtAkdeniz> do i need to change $('#delete') to $('#delete_'+id) ?
[20:27:19] <sohum> hey! I have a weird case where running the dom click event $(...).get(0).click() works, but running jquery's click $(...).click() doesn't trigger the handler. Any ideas?
[21:24:29] <Uhkis> sohum: not 100% but i'd say triggering .click() doesn't work on collections and you have to loop them with .each()
[21:25:41] <Uhkis> mrtAkdeniz: id's are unique, fix your html. you probably want class="delete" instead of id.
[21:25:59] <mrtAkdeniz> yeah Uhkis, i fixed it with classes and each function
[21:26:16] <Uhkis> :-)
[21:52:45] <sohum> Uhkis: all jquery results are collections, so that can't be it
[21:59:49] <dimi1947> I have a problem with mouseenter....I am trying to achieve an effect where on mouseenter an icon appears inside a div....this happens though everytime mouseenter is triggered...I want it to happen only once and at the same time the icon removed on mouse leave
[22:00:34] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/    check the closed checkbox on Monday and open the console to see what happens
[22:00:55] <dimi1947> line 29 function
[22:01:32] <dimi1947> is it maybe better to use CSS for the effect I want to achieve?
[22:04:42] <Palmer11> you could do it with both? are you just trying to apply a style?
[22:06:15] <dimi1947> I am just trying to add an image inside a div---that's it.
[22:06:48] <Palmer11> then css. you don’t need jquery to apply a style
[22:08:17] <Palmer11> div:hover { } should do it
[22:09:18] <dimi1947> after that I will have to attach a click handler to that image...that is the plan
[22:11:18] <dimi1947> the only thing that must be mentioned is that this effect must take place after a checkbox is ticked...
[22:11:34] <dimi1947> that is why I am thinking maybe jquery is needed here
[22:14:36] <Palmer11> button:checked + div { }
[22:14:51] <Palmer11> that would modify a div, if the button is checked
[22:29:49] <dimi1947> in the syntax you wrote where is the hover effect?
[22:30:20] <dimi1947> and it is not a button...it is a checkbox
[22:32:06] <Palmer11> input:checked will result the same thing
[22:33:08] <Palmer11> you can do input:checked + div:hover, would be called if the input is checked, and the div is being hovered
[23:05:45] <dimi1947> I am confused a little...this is jquery syntax...is in it?
[23:06:19] <dimi1947> and in the place of div I will put the id of it
[23:06:55] <dimi1947> can you do this on the jsfiddle please https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/
[23:07:49] <Palmer11> what am I doing?
[23:12:51] <Cork> dimi1947: what exactly are you asking about?
[23:16:27] <Palmer11> he doesn’t know if he should use jquery or css to style
[23:16:58] <Cork> you should always use css if at all possible
[23:17:07] <Cork> js shouldn't be your stylesheet
[23:17:25] <Palmer11> nope. if anything, it should only add/remove a class
[23:17:31] <Palmer11> but he shouldn’t need it
[23:17:34] <Cork> it makes it a magnitude harder to maintain the page
[23:18:14] <Cork> ya, looks like :hover could do the job just fine
[23:33:04] <dimi1947> yes but this hover effect must take place after a checkbox is ticked
[23:33:15] <Palmer11> exactly
[23:33:17] <Palmer11> input:checked
[23:33:31] <Palmer11> I’ve already showed you an css example
[23:33:46] <dimi1947> this input:checked...is it jquery syntax or css?
[23:33:52] <Palmer11> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp
[23:33:53] <Palmer11> its css
[23:33:56] <dimi1947> oh
[23:34:27] <Palmer11> read the selector(s) to understand them
[23:34:31] <Palmer11> then implement what you want
[23:34:40] <Palmer11> you should be able to achieve your result with css only
[23:34:48] <dimi1947> another thing is that we are talking here about many divs....with an input each
[23:35:11] <dimi1947> each hover must be tied to the specific div
[23:35:49] <dimi1947> can CSS handle this thing I mentioned?
[23:35:59] <Palmer11> should
[23:36:14] <Palmer11> you are only looking to see if a button/input is checked
[23:36:24] <Cork> dimi1947: as long as the checkbox isn't inside the div it works just fine
[23:36:39] <Cork> dimi1947: if the input is inside you have to set a class on the div as the checkbox is changed
[23:36:46] <Palmer11> element+element - Selects all <p> elements that are placed immediately after <div> elements
[23:37:02] <Cork> or ~ if there is something else inbetween
[23:37:11] <Palmer11> so if you did <input / > <div />
[23:37:17] <Palmer11> then input:checked + div { }
[23:37:39] <Cork> you prob want to have a class instead of "input" though
[23:37:50] <Cork> else you will give this effect to every input in the page
[23:39:11] <dimi1947> that is what I am talking about and yes the input is inside the div....just see the fiddle I gave
[23:39:41] <Cork> Palmer11: also don't use w3schools for reference
[23:39:55] <dimi1947> what to use then?
[23:39:57] <Cork> its a shitty site, and a good source of confusion
[23:40:01] <Palmer11> its just a selector reference
[23:40:13] <Cork> mdn msdn or any of the other sane resources out there
[23:40:17] <Palmer11> I would never use w3schools to learn and/or read detailed information
[23:40:23] <Palmer11> yea, but that was the first link
[23:40:23] <Palmer11> lol
[23:40:34] <Cork> ?mdn selector
[23:40:35] <b-ot> Cork: Selectors - Web developer guide | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors
[23:40:57] <Palmer11> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh781510(v=vs.85).aspx
[23:40:57] <Cork> there is a reason why there isn't a w3cschools trigger in here :)
[23:41:15] <Palmer11> only a w3c killer
[23:41:28] <dimi1947> Ok I got yhe picture...
[23:41:33] <Palmer11> I actually didn’t know msdn had css docs
[23:41:40] <Palmer11> I only used it for c++, c#
[23:42:06] <dimi1947> can you write all that is being said here in a fiddle...if you can?
[23:42:26] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/
[23:42:47] <dimi1947> the way the irc client works I cannot copy code as I want.
[23:43:25] <Kartagis> !w3fools
[23:43:55] <Cork> dimi1947: ahyway https://jsfiddle.net/ffx62dya/18/
[23:44:01] <Cork> line 57 is all js you need
[23:44:06] <Cork> the rest can be pure css
[23:44:43] <Cork> you prob want to use a more descriptive class then "checked" though
[23:45:42] <dimi1947> so I now I have to create a class that will achieve the hover effect
[23:46:04] <Cork> no you need to add a selector that uses that class + :hover
[23:46:26] <Cork> so in this case .checked:hover { background-color: yellow; }
[23:47:33] <dimi1947> I was going to do the same thing...I said with different words then yours...give me a sec
[23:49:33] <dimi1947> it does not work...  https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/ffx62dya/20/
[23:50:49] <Palmer11> you never applied the class
[23:51:49] <dimi1947> yes but the lines 57-58....does'nt do that?
[23:53:32] <dimi1947> I have also written the CSS
