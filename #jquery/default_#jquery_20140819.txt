[00:00:50] <jop008> is there tooling to position elements with jquery (mobile)
[00:02:35] <krishnaveda> Jattenalle, this is cool aint it  ? http://stackoverflow.com/a/4303862
[00:18:23] <jop008> I can't get them on one row http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_09.16.52-M10XzB4g.png
[00:19:02] <jop008> <lable><auto complete field using unorder liest> and then the button
[00:19:21] <jop008> no where I can find help or directions how to do this
[00:19:28] <bobdobbs> how do I define the condition "if the clicked element is not targetEl or one of it's children"?
[00:20:42] <jop008> I think some jq magic is done based on the data role
[00:20:44] <frank_o> Are there any alternatives to http://handlebarsjs.com/?
[00:21:00] <jop008> using chrome element inspector didn't help
[00:31:49] <AdamPDotty> bobdobbs: targetEl.parent().find(clicked).length
[00:32:54] <Cork> that will match more then just the current element or children
[00:33:01] <Cork> it will match all the siblings too
[00:34:07] <AdamPDotty> oh right, then two steps
[00:34:12] <Cork> $(target).find('*').addBack().is(clicked) should work though
[00:35:20] <Cork> hmm
[00:35:26] <Cork> no it can be done much simpler
[00:35:40] <Cork> $(clicked).closest(targetEl).length > 0
[00:36:13] <AdamPDotty> closest includes the element itself?
[00:36:17] <Cork> yes
[00:37:48] <AdamPDotty> I get no response from jquery.com
[00:37:58] <Cork> ?down jquery.com
[00:38:33] <Cork> yup seams so
[00:39:01] <b-ot> Cork: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's not just you! http://jquery.com is down! (ETIMEDOUT)
[00:39:56] <frank_o> Hello! I'm trying to use Mustache.js so I can do `var popup = '<div class="popup">{{some.content}}</div>` instead of `var popup = '<div class="popup">' + some.content + '</div>'`? But is there a way to put each element on its own line without getting a syntax erro? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/6u0puc3b/
[00:42:39] <frank_o> its for my supercool new map app: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bmrvbup5/4/
[01:10:38] <jop008> Does anybody know why my css direction is not taken into account http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.09.31-GuUkPvkh.png
[01:10:58] <jop008> form.ui-filterable     float: left !important;    width: 77% !important;    color:red;  }
[01:15:59] <Cork> jop008: we can't debug an image
[01:18:03] <jop008> I knew I sent fiddles before
[01:21:09] <TGT> It seems jquery.com is down, or is it just for me?
[01:21:32] <Cork> TGT: nope known
[01:23:28] <bobdobbs> TGT: down for me too
[01:24:11] <bobdobbs> inside document.ready, I set a variable: var myVar. How do I access it from the console?
[01:24:31] <Cork> bobdobbs: you would have to breakpoint in the function scope
[01:24:33] <TGT> you cant
[01:24:43] <bobdobbs> I can't?
[01:24:47] <Cork> some consoles have commands to navigate into the scope
[01:24:55] <Cork> but ya, normally you can't
[01:24:56] <bobdobbs> hmmmm
[01:24:58] <bobdobbs> dang
[01:25:13] <Cork> do window.global_access_version_of_myVar = myVar
[01:25:13] <bobdobbs> this is the chromedev console, if that makes a difference
[01:25:17] <Cork> then you can access it
[01:25:34] <bobdobbs> k
[01:25:36] <bobdobbs> thanks
[01:25:54] <bobdobbs> Cork: a  quick test confirms your assertion
[01:27:51] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.09.31-GuUkPvkh.png on screen my element takes the whole page width but in css I did some changes not taking effect see screenshot http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.09.31-GuUkPvkh.png
[01:31:21] <TGT> seems those properties are overridden...
[01:31:25] <krishnaveda> I see my javascript working fine in chrome mac but fails in chrome windows ? does such things happen ? I mean is it usual ?
[01:33:24] <jop008> If I know the class name can I show the content of the class in JS?
[01:49:57] <jop008> if my style overwritten can I find out by what setting?
[01:52:04] <jop008> my style which includes important is overwritten
[01:52:10] <Cork> jop008: depends
[01:52:22] <jop008> on?
[01:52:34] <Cork> if it is css rules you can view the style view in the developer tools
[01:52:47] <Cork> if it is inline css that is overwritten by inline css your out of luck
[01:52:57] <jop008> In my css width:75% but it is with a srike thru
[01:53:10] <jop008> css rules?
[01:53:16] <Cork> find the rule that has width that isn't stroken through
[01:54:43] <jop008> but how to find it?
[01:54:50] <Cork> by looking?
[01:55:01] <jop008> at?
[01:55:15] <Cork> uh
[01:55:17] <Cork> the list?
[01:55:27] <jop008> where can I find the list?
[01:55:35] <Cork> ... the style list you just looked at
[01:55:47] <jop008> I can find it
[01:56:03] <jop008> and search is not working
[01:56:20] <jop008> it is a long list how to find it in this list
[01:56:33] <Cork> you would have to scan it by hand
[01:56:56] <jop008> but I don't know how
[01:57:06] <jop008> I don't see a whole list
[01:58:27] <jop008> this is on my screen http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-08-19_at_10.26.24-FujJSRpq.png
[01:58:34] <jop008> so what to do?
[02:07:33] <jop008> but how can a css element with important in it being overwritten?
[02:09:32] <bobdobbs> jop008: I've only just come into the conversation, but... how handy are you with devtools?
[02:09:56] <bobdobbs> cos that's the kind of question that devtools is/are really good for
[02:10:06] <jop008> devtools?
[02:10:09] <jop008> like?
[02:10:23] <jop008> firebug etc?
[02:10:27] <bobdobbs> yep
[02:11:03] <jop008> I use them ocassionally
[02:11:16] <jop008> but css is a mass
[02:11:35] <jop008> can't find out how it works 6 hours on 1 element positioning
[02:11:40] <BadCodSmell> I have an element that moves in jquery but it does not update mouse enter/leave... can i trigge a recheck?
[02:13:33] <Cork> BadCodSmell: the events is only triggered by mouse move, not element move
[02:13:51] <BadCodSmell> I figured that
[02:13:58] <BadCodSmell> But simulating a mouse move seems tricky
[02:14:07] <Cork> and there isn't really a generic way to do it
[02:14:15] <Cork> it is
[02:14:18] <BadCodSmell> I'm hoping jquery has some functionality built in to simplify it
[02:14:25] <Cork> it doesn't
[02:14:34] <BadCodSmell> pants then
[02:14:36] <Cork> you could bind a mousemove event on docuemtn
[02:14:40] <Cork> *document
[02:14:47] <jop008> I tried firebug but no party
[02:14:48] <Cork> and have it store the cursor position
[02:15:04] <Cork> and after you've moved the element check if it has moved out from under the cursor
[02:15:14] <Cork> tedious
[02:15:42] <BadCodSmell> I could save the event from the onclick maybe
[02:15:51] <BadCodSmell> and pass it through to a fake mouse move
[02:16:00] <BadCodSmell> I think at the least many of the event params might be the same
[02:16:13] <BadCodSmell> That way I would only need to change one or two params?
[02:16:25] <BadCodSmell> A click initiates the motion...
[02:17:09] <BadCodSmell> I guess I will need to possibly change type and target ele..
[02:17:23] <BadCodSmell> Hacky but *might* work, I'll try that, thanks for inpiration
[02:17:28] <Cork> but the only solution i can think of
[02:18:55] <aphorise> hmm jquery sites all done
[02:18:57] <aphorise> cdn, etc
[02:18:58] <jop008> my FF is unstable sometimes come with inspect element ans sometimes not
[02:19:11] <jop008> so google chrome is the one I use
[02:19:12] <aphorise> down*
[02:19:15] <Cork> aphorise: ya, known
[02:20:05] <Zemljoradnik> anybody know why it's down, and how long will it stay down?
[02:20:17] <Cork> nope
[02:20:26] <Zemljoradnik> Ok, thanks.
[02:20:34] <Cork> i reported it to the infrastructure ppl when it went down
[02:20:39] <Cork> but no response as of yet
[02:20:57] <Cork> (that was 2h+ ago)
[02:21:51] <Zemljoradnik> Thanks Cork.
[02:24:41] <Jimmy_Rustles> is there some way to find out what code is changing a particular input field?
[02:25:24] <Cork> Jimmy_Rustles: not really no
[02:28:28] <aphorise> Cork u work @ jfoundation?  :-)
[02:28:36] <Cork> aphorise: no
[02:30:57] <aphorise> Cork is this sort of down time common?
[02:31:13] <Cork> aphorise: it's happened a few times before
[02:31:27] <Cork> so not common but not uncommon
[02:47:17] <Uhkis> what is down
[02:47:33] <Uhkis> oh..
[02:52:00] <t4nk231> Is it possible that jquery.com and jqueryui.com aren't avaiable at the moment?
[02:52:01] <t4nk231> http://www.site24x7.com/public/t/results-1408441852811.html
[02:53:16] <Jimmy_Rustles> any idea how I can fix this behaviour w/ jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/xudgu787/
[02:53:53] <Jimmy_Rustles> If you enter a location (including a street address), then hit tab, it replaces the first+second fields with some value
[02:54:21] <Jimmy_Rustles> if you instead hit the Enter key, as soon as the field is unfocused/blurred, the value changes back to the full text
[02:57:06] <Cork> t4nk231: yes, they are down
[03:00:38] <t4nk231> Cork, thank you. Thought I messed up my internet connection.
[03:01:01] <Cork> ?g down to everyone or just me
[03:01:01] <b-ot> Cork: Down For Everyone Or Just Me -> Check if your website is down or ... → http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/
[03:01:10] <Cork> t4nk231: for the next time you wonder ^
[03:02:02] <t4nk231> Cork, haha, looks nice :-)
[03:04:00] <mlechner> hi, i'use $.ajax to request a document (odt) from an url. but how can i return it as a file for download on success? the odt is fully in result.
[03:04:33] <ribot> hey
[03:04:34] <Cork> mlechner: you can't
[03:04:41] <Cork> ajax can't cause downloads
[03:06:05] <Cork> mlechner: basically if you want to get a download make a normal link, or use window.location or window.open
[03:06:44] <Cork> mlechner: there is one option that works in modern browsers where you can save the data from ajax as a blob
[03:06:56] <Cork> and then convert that blob to a data uri
[03:07:11] <Cork> then add it to a href for an a ling and have the use download it through that
[03:07:30] <Cork> but those are your options
[03:13:11] <mlechner> Cork, thnx. may be i use a wrong approach. I have a download-link returning an odt-Document. because generating the odt takes about 20 seconds, i wanted to show a spinner while gerating. I thought using ajax for that could solve this. Is there a better way fo rthat?
[03:13:52] <Cork> mlechner: show the spinner while from a click handler
[03:14:02] <Cork> and just let the default action point to the link
[03:14:10] <Cork> that should give you the spinner and the download
[03:21:47] <fleetfox> Hello, i have this: https://dpaste.de/sGqt/raw , what's the ideomatic way to bind submit action only once? i have poor understanding of js
[03:22:06] <delboy1978uk> is jqueryui.com down right now, or is it just me?
[03:22:13] <AjitS> Hi can I typecast a string as object in jQuery?
[03:22:29] <Cork> AjitS: no
[03:22:33] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[03:22:51] <AjitS> Cork: Even if it has the same format as the required object
[03:22:52] <AjitS> ?
[03:22:53] <Cork> delboy1978uk: yes it is
[03:23:05] * delboy1978uk grumbles
[03:23:11] <Cork> AjitS: again what are you trying to do?
[03:23:50] <mlechner> Cork, sounds simple. but if I do a window.open() on the url the javascript goes on and hides the spinner immediately - see: http://pastebin.com/fdiFwRCy
[03:24:03] <AjitS> Cork: Trying to resume the same thing that I left a couple of days ago.. Trying to implement arktan widget
[03:24:19] <Cork> mlechner: yes window.open will open a new tab so the current page won't be visible
[03:24:51] <Cork> AjitS: not specific enough
[03:24:59] <Cork> are you trying to work with json or what?
[03:25:02] <ribot> i know how to delegate to dynamic content using $('form').on('click','.dynamicElement'), but on this event i want to select dynamically added content outside the form, such as $outside = $('.outside .dynamicContent'), but here i cannot manipulate $outside
[03:25:52] <Cork> ribot: the match set is static, it can't be refreshed
[03:26:04] <Cork> you need to make a new query
[03:26:09] <mlechner> Cork, is there an alternative for window.open not showing this behaviour? I used "_self" in wondow.open zo prevent opening a new tab, but this does not work
[03:27:03] <Cork> mlechner: <a id="download" href="target">download</a> js: $('#download').on('click', function() { /* enable throbber */ })
[03:28:17] <AjitS> Cork: Yes, I am trying to implement http://arktan.com/product/arktan-social-streams, for which I want to get a JSON object which I am building using jQuery : http://pastebin.com/vqA2Rhbi
[03:28:35] <Cork> AjitS: so use JSON.parse
[03:28:42] <Cork> (haven't i told you this before?)
[03:28:47] <AjitS> Cork: I tried that..
[03:28:56] <Cork> ok?
[03:29:03] <AjitS> Cork: Missed to paste that line
[03:29:14] <Cork> make a jsfiddle
[03:29:24] <Cork> dead code isn't really much help
[03:29:24] <AjitS> Cork: okay.. give me a min
[03:32:53] <ribot> Cork: how can i make a new query?
[03:33:01] <Cork> $('selector')
[03:34:45] <ribot> Cork: inside the .on function i do make a new query, but it doesn't affect the dynamic content it selects
[03:34:53] <ribot> or that it should select
[03:35:10] <Cork> ribot: it would or the dynamic content isn't in the page yet
[03:35:15] <AjitS> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/AjitS/L5hdeyag
[03:36:09] <AjitS> Cork: I have hardcoded the 'itemOverride' with the Object I get. It works fine and the widget is returned right
[03:36:58] <AjitS> Cork: however when I substitute it from the value I get from JSON.parse, it doesn't get the right images
[03:37:18] <Cork> AjitS: i need the failing example not the working one
[03:37:29] <Cork> well i need both, but mostly the failing example
[03:38:42] <AjitS> Cork: Okay. The failing example can only be seen on the live site. http://warnermusicnashville.wmg-gardens.com/
[03:39:56] <AjitS> Cork: the pastebin code that I posted is how I get the JSON from the DOM
[03:40:13] <AjitS> http://pastebin.com/vqA2Rhbi
[03:40:23] <Cork> AjitS: why don't you just create an object?
[03:40:29] <Cork> as you don't want the json
[03:41:16] <AjitS> Cork: Not sure how do I do that. I am a noob in jQuery. I could have easily achieved it with programming.
[03:41:48] <AjitS> Cork: Any references that I could see on how could I implement this?
[03:42:00] <ribot> Cork: ok thanks
[03:43:01] <AjitS> Cork: Hence the question. Can I typecast that string to object
[03:44:03] <Cork> AjitS: http://jsfiddle.net/p06x7r0e/
[03:45:28] <AjitS> Cork: Thanks! Trying it out
[03:53:33] <ClemensTolboom> is http://jquery.com/ dead?
[03:54:03] * ClemensTolboom it never lived but getting timeout
[04:12:53] <dogmatic69_> hi all, I have a strange issue. $(document) is null and jQuery(document) works fine
[04:13:05] <dogmatic69_> any idea why? (its only on one page this is happening)
[04:13:56] <AdamPDotty> some other skript taking over $ ?
[04:15:25] <dogmatic69_> AdamPDotty:  I will have a look, its legacy code so anything is possible
[04:18:00] <dogmatic69_> AdamPDotty:  cant find anything :/
[04:26:56] <dogmatic69_> AdamPDotty:  actually found it.. function $(id)  ...
[04:29:27] <ravigehlot> This code http://jsfiddle.net/kv5gx8dx/ works but the text fades in with the background. how to avoid having the text fadein?
[04:40:17] <ph88> can i use multiple .done functions on a jqXHR object ?
[04:52:16] <Cork> ph88: yes
[04:54:18] <ph88> Cork: can i define my own functions next to .fail() .always() and .done() ?  or is this bad practice ?
[04:55:04] <Cork> ph88: you can, though it isn't really recommended as there are other functions that only checks for those
[04:55:11] <Cork> like $.when
[04:55:14] <Cork> and .then
[04:55:35] <ph88> oh ok
[04:56:05] <Cork> ph88: but there is absolutely nothing preventing you from adding a a separate callback handler
[04:56:35] <ph88> because the server returns a status code and depending on that it should perform different actions. So now if i have two .done()  each of them should check for a different status. So i thought it might be nice to make something like .doneBusy and .doneReady
[04:56:38] <Cork> var callback = $.Callbacks(); def.myHandler = callback.add;
[04:56:59] <Cork> then you just do callback.fire(data)
[04:57:19] <Cork> and "def" is the object you return from your function
[04:57:35] <Cork> (def as from deferred)
[04:58:25] <Cork> and def.myHandler(function(data) {}) would work similarly to how .done works
[04:58:35] <Cork> except you control when it is fired
[04:59:06] <ph88> hhmm i'm not sure it's worth it in this case. Perhaps just checking the status explicitely in the .done() functions makes the code simpler
[04:59:15] <Cork> or you could so return { myHandler: callback.add };
[04:59:20] <Cork> it doens't need to be a deferred
[04:59:44] <Cork> ph88: depends if you want the function to support $.when and the like
[04:59:54] <Cork> cause then ya it would complicate those
[05:00:21] <Cork> it doesn't complicate the code much, so it is mostly a matter of taste
[05:00:30] <ph88> hmm ok thx Cork
[05:00:38] <Cork> both should be fairly easy to maintain
[05:00:47] <Cork> one would have a littel more code duplication
[05:01:32] <danake> wazup with jquery.com?
[05:01:55] <arschmitz> danake: its down we are working on it
[05:02:29] <danake> awesome
[05:06:43] <ph88> Cork: how can i check if the jqXHR is still busy?
[05:07:54] <dogmatic69_> ph88:  you could use ajaxStart / ajaxStop maybe?
[05:08:11] <dogmatic69_> set a flag in start, clear it in stop
[05:08:26] <ph88> well the api docs are not available atm :/
[05:09:06] <dogmatic69_> http://pastebin.com/cxEffunn
[05:09:57] <ph88> noooo, not globally ! my app is using a lot of ajax requests
[05:10:11] <dogmatic69_> well you can define that where ever you like
[05:11:33] <toothrot> why are you neding to check this ?
[05:11:51] <toothrot> isn't that defeating the purpose of the callbacks
[05:11:54] <ph88> hhmm ye good point actually :/
[05:12:08] <ph88> i could just check the existence of the jqXHR object itself
[05:20:30] <b101011010> hello
[05:21:31] <coreyfarrell> anyone else experiencing trouble reaching the jquery website?
[05:22:21] <Jacta> no
[05:23:06] <b101011010> no
[05:23:33] <b101011010> ... :/ yes
[05:23:36] <coreyfarrell> :( I can't reach it from home or from two datacenters.
[05:24:05] <b101011010> not work's for me too
[05:25:20] <b101011010> there are a tweet about ?
[05:26:03] <coreyfarrell> anyone know of a mirror for api.jquery.com and plugins.jquery.com?
[05:27:23] <b101011010> or google cache ?
[05:28:20] <b101011010> there are maybe offline documentation
[05:28:26] <b101011010> what your version ?
[05:28:37] <b101011010> coreyfarrell: https://bbuseruploads.s3.amazonaws.com/greydwarf/jquerydoc/downloads/jquery_ref.html?Signature=YCuiMn2UamMvejH7nELIGS2sjHI%3D&Expires=1408453077&AWSAccessKeyId=0EMWEFSGA12Z1HF1TZ82
[05:29:08] <PhonicUK> ah so I'm not the only one who can't reach the site right now
[05:29:10] <b101011010> coreyfarrell: forum work : http://forum.jquery.com/
[05:30:16] <PhonicUK> I feel a great disturbance in the jQuery API site, as if a thousand developers cried out and were suddenly silenced.
[05:30:26] <Neosublimation> Hey, as the docs are currently down, could someone please tell me how to have JQuery UI Accordions collapsed by default?
[05:30:55] <PhonicUK> Neosublimation, at a guess, add {open: false} to the call that instantiates them
[05:31:01] <PhonicUK> or maybe it's collapsed: true
[05:31:17] <PhonicUK> $("#mySelector").accordian({collapsed: true});
[05:31:24] <PhonicUK> I'm taking a stab without the docs though xD
[05:32:00] <imduffy15> Hi All. I'm wanting to destory a draggable element on drop. I can't access the docs over at jqueryui.com/draggable/ any help?
[05:32:02] <coreyfarrell> b101011010: the cache site you gave me will work good enough for core API reference, but that doesn't help me find a plugins for date and time entry :(
[05:33:01] <b101011010> arf :/ there are another documentation about reference : http://jqapi.com/
[05:33:03] <Neosublimation> PhonicUK: Neither nor unfortunately. :(
[05:33:12] <Neosublimation> I also tried collapse: true and closed: true
[05:33:23] <PhonicUK> Neosublimation, tried open: false ?
[05:33:50] <Neosublimation> Yeah
[05:34:08] <coreyfarrell> b101011010: that one is much better :)
[05:34:24] <Adamski2600> So how come the site is down?
[05:34:49] <Neosublimation> Even weirder, I've a page here where it's collapsed by default, but I can't find the code that does that. I found the initialization however.
[05:35:19] <PhonicUK> I wonder if the API docs page/db is on github or anything
[05:35:23] <PhonicUK> so anyone could host their own copy
[05:35:26] <Neosublimation> Let's try Google Cache
[05:35:37] <PhonicUK> the google cache isn't working too great for me
[05:35:55] <Neosublimation> Most annoying thing is probably that it's damn slow.
[05:35:58] <PhonicUK> aye
[05:36:15] <PhonicUK> whats funny is I generally don't need to use the site, but the one time I need to...
[05:36:40] <PhonicUK> Neosublimation, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7947789/jquery-ui-accordion-start-collapsed
[05:36:41] <Neosublimation> If someone requests a cached page a Google employee needs to take the elevator to the basement and search for the right hdd.
[05:37:11] <PhonicUK> tadah
[05:37:15] <Neosublimation> PhonicUK: Ah cool man, thanks. :D
[05:37:18] <PhonicUK> np
[05:37:24] <Neosublimation> I'm for changing this option's name now.
[05:37:30] <Neosublimation> To something intuitive. :P
[05:37:37] <Neosublimation> Like collapsed: true
[05:37:43] <coreyfarrell> for anyone using google cache you will want to click 'text-only version' otherwise it seems to timeout loading
[05:37:51] <PhonicUK> Neosublimation, consider yourself slapped on the wrist however, it was the first result from googling "jquery accordion start closed"
[05:37:55] <PhonicUK> :P
[05:38:07] <Neosublimation> Sorry Google employee, you can bring the HDD back.
[05:38:11] <PhonicUK> lol
[05:38:13] <VectorX> i need to submit the page / form when you click on a anchor tag, the form does not exist, but i just need to submit the page passing it some post information, like say the work 'apple' as a variable fruit, what would be the best way to do this ?
[05:38:52] <PhonicUK> VectorX, use .ajax with the option set to make it a POST request?
[05:39:11] <VectorX> PhonicUK i need the page to submit
[05:39:12] <Neosublimation> PhonicUK: Yeah, I searched for a more general reference and failed. Didn't know there war exactly that question somewhere as it's really simple with the docs probably.
[05:39:25] <VectorX> not using ajax
[05:39:28] <PhonicUK> VectorX, you need a form to do that then
[05:39:42] <PhonicUK> if one doesn't exist then you need to create one dynamically using hidden fields
[05:40:09] <VectorX> PhonicUK ok so some form with hidden fields would do, and just populate the field and submit
[05:42:57] <frank_o> Is it just me or is it overkill to use Slick.js for this image slider? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/1/ -- ideally I just want to slide from the 1st, to 2nd, to 3rd image, and then stop.
[05:43:05] <PhonicUK> VectorX, yup
[05:43:47] <frank_o> gotusaa: Please don't PM me. If you're doing free camshows, be a sport and share it with the whole channel.
[05:44:46] <sacho> frank_o, I think that's premature optimization - if slick.js is what you're used to using, and you don't have performance or size problems, then why not
[05:45:00] <sacho> it's much more important to be comfortable in using an external library rather than trying to find the "perfect" one
[05:45:21] <sacho> because you'll be stuck maintaining it if you suddenly need new features
[05:47:47] <frank_o> sacho: Well, I don't need a fully-fledged slider really. I just want to slide some text on top of this div once and be done with it. I'm thinking I might as well be using animate()?
[05:48:48] <frank_o> sacho: Slick is by far the coolest slider plug I've come across, but look at all the stuff I had to disable just to get what I'm after.
[05:50:30] <sacho> you could use an animate, but you'd end up with more code.
[05:50:48] <Matt3o12> Does anyone know a "backup" API?
[05:50:54] <frank_o> hmm
[05:50:54] <Matt3o12> *API docs
[05:52:00] <s5fs> We are working to restore service to the docs and other sites, sorry for the outage everyone!
[05:57:40] <sacho> you are the 0.05%
[06:00:47] <s5fs> sacho: I am sitting on hold with our web host haha!
[06:00:55] <s5fs> listening to Van Morrison
[06:05:10] <TGT> Anybody knows why jquery.com is down right now?
[06:07:12] <sacho> <s5fs> We are working to restore service to the docs and other sites, sorry for the outage everyone!
[06:07:43] <TGT> Thanks for answer
[06:10:19] <BillCriswell> I hate computers.
[06:13:07] <b101011010> th
[06:13:08] <b101011010> x
[06:13:11] <b101011010> thx =)
[06:13:19] <s5fs> toothrot: Should be up now
[06:16:40] <Matt3o12> Thanks. What was the problem, if I may ask?
[06:22:01] <ryankask> hi is it documented anywhere what happens when you pass null or undefined as a selector to the various traversal functions?
[06:23:21] <theipirate> Hi. Is there an easy way to get the id of a select element that contains a selected option?
[06:23:45] <javascript323> hi everyone
[06:24:28] <javascript323> I have a very basic question. I currently keep jQuery version in version (e.g 1.4)
[06:24:42] <javascript323> and I compare it as a float: if (parseFloat( version) < 1.4) ...
[06:24:59] <javascript323> However, then it thinks version 1.4 is newer than version 1.10.2
[06:25:13] <javascript323> How can I solve it, just compare two strings or?
[06:27:01] <AdamPDotty> hmm, probably split by the point
[06:27:11] <AdamPDotty> string would not help
[06:28:59] <AdamPDotty> theipirate: that has any selected option or a specific?
[06:29:22] <s5fs> Matt3o12: Still working with the hosting provider to figure out root cause. Symptoms for me were the same as for you, the host was unreachable from the public internet.
[06:29:49] <s5fs> So, support guy ssh'd in and rebooted the host for me. Now it's fine? Not my favorite answer haha!
[06:30:00] <Matt3o12> Ok. Thank’s I’ll stay tuned :)
[06:30:21] <s5fs> Matt3o12: i doubt we'll do much to notify the community about the outage, but it was down a long ass time.
[06:30:36] <javascript323> AdamPDotty: So I should develop my own version checker mechanism?
[06:30:46] <s5fs> CDN was up still though haha!
[06:30:52] <Matt3o12> I know :P
[06:31:01] <s5fs> (this time!)
[06:31:02] <Matt3o12> It was 6 hours done, right?
[06:31:21] <s5fs> Matt3o12: yeah, that looks correct. just before midnight PST it went down.
[06:32:11] <Marecki1> Hi there. Got a question about accessing element style information using jQuery, I can't help but feel that I am doing something wrong but I cannot figure it out... Anyway, here goes:
[06:32:26] <AdamPDotty> [09:37] <AdamPDotty> I get no response from jquery.com
[06:32:41] <Marecki1> AdamPDotty: It should be back up now.
[06:32:43] <Ronald2K> BillCriswell - I have to take back what I said yesterday. Sometimes different parts will need different formatting. The formatting will be different based on the listbox choice
[06:32:54] <Matt3o12> @Marecki1 Works fine for me
[06:32:55] <AdamPDotty> yep, is. That was 6 hours ago
[06:33:01] <s5fs> AdamPDotty: I was sleepin' yo
[06:33:10] <AdamPDotty> no sleep for you anymore then
[06:33:10] <Marecki1> My style sheet looks a bit like this: .dataSet { font-size: 14px; }  .dataSet.active { font-size: 18px; }
[06:33:16] <s5fs> AdamPDotty: haha clearly not
[06:33:34] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: You'd have to come up with some way to decide if you want it bold or not.
[06:33:45] <s5fs> AdamPDotty: We're back up and waiting for info on the outage, host is trying to determine root cause. I'm checking the notification server to figure out why I didn't hear about it earlier.
[06:34:20] <Marecki1> I have got a list of span elements of class "dataSet" (i.e. none of them are initially active). Question: how would I get the font size of active state?
[06:34:26] <Ronald2K> Well, I can decide for each choice, but I can't find a method to format what JQuery can update
[06:35:08] <Marecki1> Tried $('.dataSet.active').css('font-size') but it always gives me undefined, possibly because no active elements exist yet (?).
[06:35:17] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: With your current method you can do something like data-bold-category="true" but based on how much more you have to do you're going to go nuts with data attributes.
[06:35:23] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: How does this data come in?
[06:36:18] <AdamPDotty> Marecki1: you could cheat and create a new one outside DOM and set it active, but theres probably an easy way to access CSS.
[06:36:29] <Ronald2K> The data comes from the db, but the formatting is static, based on the listbox choice
[06:36:43] <Ronald2K> so "Atlanta" formats one way, "Riverdale" formats another way
[06:36:43] <Marecki1> Then I tried something like this: $(listOfSpans[0]).addClass('active').css('font-size') - but that still gives me 14px even though the field in question does end up marked active in the browser...
[06:37:39] <Marecki1> (I can get away with this because I know I can then safely remove active class from the same element).
[06:38:01] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Does that data say if something should be bold?
[06:38:33] <Marecki1> Funny thing is, I'm almost sure I did manage to see 18px at some point - but I went on to clean up the code and in the end forgot what it was that actually worked.
[06:42:21] <Ronald2K> Well... it did at first, but that's when I was trying to make it work in an input box. But no, the formatting info is not in the db.
[06:42:32] <Marecki1> Do I have to refresh the computed style somehow?
[06:47:06] <AdamPDotty> Do you have a test case?
[06:47:33] <Ronald2K> I was using the data-category to hold something like data-category="<b>$Category</b>: <i>$categoryname</i>
[06:47:50] <Ronald2K> but I could find anything that Jquery would update with the value that would render the html
[06:49:35] <Ronald2K> JQuery could update the input, but then it shows no formatting. A div would show formatting, but I can't get JQuery to update the div
[06:50:03] <krishnaveda> does the ajax call cache:false use the adding timestamp to url internally ?
[06:51:50] <NoiseEee> Ronald2K: input boxes aren't styleable with "<b>"
[06:52:24] <AdamPDotty> and spans should not be
[06:54:53] <Ronald2K> Yes Noise. I learned that yesterday, but inputs are what JQuery updates
[06:55:01] <Marecki1> Okay, now I am seriously confused. I've just written a bit of code like this:
[06:55:15] <Ronald2K> I am trying to handle the formatting differently for each listbox value's updated data
[06:55:28] <Ronald2K> I just can't figure out what method to use
[06:56:02] <NoiseEee> perhaps you want to simulate a list box
[06:56:12] <NoiseEee> check into select2 or other plugins
[06:56:28] <NoiseEee> but for gods sakes use styles
[06:56:49] <dan2k3k4> Any CKEditor users here? I'm trying to minify everything into one ckeditor.min.js using Grunt uglify but it seems config.js/style.js aren't "loaded" / don't override what's default in ckeditor.js
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   $sampleEntry = $(listEntries[0]);
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   alert($sampleEntry.css('font-size'));
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   $sampleEntry.addClass('active');
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   alert($sampleEntry.css('font-size'));
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   alert($sampleEntry.css('font-size'));
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   $sampleEntry.removeClass('active');
[06:57:02] <Marecki1>   alert($sampleEntry.css('font-size'));
[06:57:14] <NoiseEee> Marecki1: STOP. do not paste code here.
[06:57:23] <Marecki1> The result? 14px, 14px, 18px, 18px.
[06:57:26] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: Do .html()
[06:57:53] <Marecki1> Yes, you see it correctly. There is NOTHING happening between the second and the third alert() and yet the returned value changes.
[06:58:24] <AdamPDotty> so the function addClass() needs some time to execute and is not ready before the next alert()
[06:58:57] <Marecki1> So it would seem. Is there any way I can tell jQuery to wait, then?
[06:59:06] <Lebbe> yes this is perfectly normal behaviour
[06:59:23] <Lebbe> the browser wont update the rendering of elements before you clog up the js-engine with an alert
[06:59:28] <NoiseEee>  Marecki1: what's the real problem you're trying to solve
[07:00:07] <Marecki1> I have to calculate maximum screen width, in pixels, of a string, which may be displayed in several - well, two - different styles.
[07:00:39] <Ronald2K> NoiseEee, the problem with styles is that the result is a combination of data pieces, each needing different formatting. And styles format the entire input box or div
[07:00:50] <Marecki1> Width calculation I have already figured out, it's the style switching which is driving me nuts.
[07:01:21] <NoiseEee> Ronald2K: if you absolutely need formatting at that level, you want to *simulate* a <select> .  google "select2"
[07:01:31] <Ronald2K> Bill, I was playing with that. So I should try using .html in the data-category
[07:01:54] <BillCriswell> Ronald2K: $('#something').html($selected.data('category')) or something like that.
[07:04:48] <Ronald2K> Yes, Bill, but the $selected.data('category') contains multiple fields, which need separate formatting.
[07:05:01] <BillCriswell> I thought you were formatting in one area though?
[07:05:33] <Ronald2K> the results go into one div, but there is separate formatting one each field.
[07:05:48] <BillCriswell> My head.
[07:06:04] <Ronald2K> and currently those fields are in the data-category of the listbox option
[07:06:06] <NoiseEee> Ronald2K: make a fiddle.
[07:06:14] <muraiki> hi all. I'm having a strange problem that I'm not 100% certain lies with JQuery. if I use $.post to send a request and I restart apache in the middle of processing that request, I found that the browser (FF and Chrome) actually ends up sending a second POST with the same request. if I mark it with a timestamp, the timestamp is the same for both requests, but the result received is from the second POST.
[07:06:49] <muraiki> what's really weird is that the browser devtools only show a single post being issued, but if I monitor the traffic using burp proxy I can see two POSTS issued, with the second one corresponding to when apache is restarted.
[07:12:22] <tempopirate> Hi. Is there an easy way to get the I'd of a select element that contains a selected option?
[07:15:06] <Cork> tempopirate: you mean a selected option or an option with a selected attribute (meaning it was selected from server side)
[07:17:08] <Ronald2K> NoiseEee and BillCriswell - Looks like .html in the div works. It formats all the individual formatting correctly.
[07:17:09] <Ronald2K> Thanks!
[07:17:38] <NoiseEee> muraiki: what's the issue?
[07:19:38] <mvpgraff> So I came thinking I may have needed help, but I found the source to my problem.
[07:19:46] <mvpgraff> I love when that happens :d
[07:19:48] <muraiki> NoiseEee: it seemed unexpected to me that a second post would be sent by the client when apache is restarted. I don't have a fail method to perform retries, and the browser devtools only show a single post. ultimately, the problem is that the server ends up receiving and processing two posts.
[07:19:59] <tempopirate> Cork: selected attribute
[07:20:12] <NoiseEee> muraiki: perhaps the browser is re-trying the broken connection?
[07:20:24] <Cork> tempopirate: $('option[selected]').closest('select')
[07:20:37] <NoiseEee> muraiki: might look into that, but thats what i'd guess. so of course it receives data from post #2
[07:21:33] <muraiki> NoiseEee: yeah, I was thinking it might be a browser problem. it's just strange that the browser network tools don't indicate that the post failed, but if I perform a second restart of apache it does show that the post failed and give up.
[07:22:26] <NoiseEee> again that seems kind of logical to me
[07:22:35] <NoiseEee> there is in fact a single xhr request
[07:22:53] <tempopirate> Cork: then .attr("id")?
[07:22:57] <Cork> yes
[07:23:02] <Cork> if you want the id and not the element
[07:23:08] <Cork> well you would have to look the result list
[07:23:18] <Cork> if you want more then one match
[07:23:41] <Cork> $.map($('option[selected]').closest('select'), function(elm) { return $(this).attr('id'); })
[07:24:01] <Cork> ^ gives you an array of ids
[07:24:29] <tempopirate> Cork: I am getting undefined
[07:24:47] <Cork> tempopirate: and the element actually have a selected attribute?
[07:25:48] <tempopirate> Cork: pastebin com/53e1zALT
[07:26:58] <Cork> tempopirate: http://jsfiddle.net/dxwf9f4L/
[07:27:16] <Cork> i wrote $(this) instead of $(elm) that might be your problem
[07:27:57] <Cork> actually, no need for the extra wrappers http://jsfiddle.net/dxwf9f4L/1/
[07:29:38] <jay__> hellow... everybody... how do i add attribute to jquery ui datepicker links??
[07:30:21] <icedude> Hi. im doing $('div',documentFragment) and jquery dont find nothing.
[07:30:52] <icedude> have tryed to find information about why i cant find my elementd inside documentFragments but nothing
[07:31:08] <icedude> then i found some example that used document fragments as context
[07:31:24] <jay__> hellow... everybody... how do i add attribute to jquery ui datepicker links?? i mean it takes attribute but then it removes it on click...
[07:31:47] <icedude> so now i am confused if you can even use document fragment as context or with .find() or such
[07:34:12] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I have a selector for a class, say $('.foo').click(function(){});  If I later remove that class from the element, the click action still fires. Is this normal?
[07:34:37] <icedude> MarcGuay: yes that is normal
[07:34:51] <MarcGuay> I remember using live() a while ago but I thought it was dead now.  I guess I could check the docs again.
[07:35:04] <dmsuperman> it's dead, .on is the new method
[07:35:18] <dmsuperman> But either way the collection will not change over time
[07:35:29] <dmsuperman> $('.foo') will always contain that element even if you modify it
[07:35:42] <dmsuperman> One solution would be to bind it to document instead
[07:35:51] <dmsuperman> $(document).on('click', '.foo', function...
[07:36:11] <MarcGuay> dmsuperman: Thanks
[07:36:59] <icedude> dmsuperman: can you tell me if i can use documentFragments as context for my selectors? Any comment on that, is that normal.
[07:37:15] <icedude> i know that i can use element,document,jquery object as context
[07:37:41] <t432> lines 1, 8 http://pastebin.com/NRMiSRXb
[07:42:17] <icedude> jea just tested again...why the hell does jquery not support docfragments.
[07:43:10] <BillCriswell> icedude: You can.
[07:45:04] <icedude> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/reseluhopuxe/1/edit?js,console,output
[07:45:36] <icedude> look i tested. I create document fragment, then add child to it. And jquery cant find that mofo:D
[07:47:50] <decx> $(d1).append won't do anything with the d1 fragment
[07:49:19] <decx> or does it?. apparentlly it does
[07:49:36] <icedude> decx: yea that is what im saying...that no jquery function works with documentFragments. On my real world case i have documentFragment that has children i i need to use documentFragment as it was normal div
[07:50:35] <icedude> fact is i cant find my shit inside docFragments. How can i do $('.class',documentFragment).
[07:51:43] <BillCriswell> Weird.
[07:52:35] <BillCriswell> icedude: http://jsbin.com/pimediqurepe/1/edit?html,js,output I get get at test with children() but I can't seem to use a .find() on it.
[07:53:21] <decx> a doc frag is a flat structure so i would think it'd be filter but that doesnt do it either
[07:53:54] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, tried that as well. I wasn't expecting .children() to return it. Think there's something weird we're overlooking.
[07:56:48] <icedude> and just to mention i used to do documentFragment.querySelector(".class") in my old code. So you can use querySelector on fragments with ease.
[07:57:26] <decx> i use that as well
[07:57:52] <icedude> but just to note here. That jquery documentation states that only elements,jquery objects, document are possible context types.
[07:58:17] <icedude> So i came here just to get a confirmation that .find or context cant be used on document fragments.
[07:58:43] <xxx1337> Can Javascript and jquery code run interchangably? For instance I have this jquery code that I dont think wants to run because i have js code right after: http://pastebin.com/vHd2wYg3
[07:58:48] <BillCriswell> I don't get why children() can be used and not .find().
[08:00:48] <icedude> BillCriswell: yes. its is wierd.
[08:02:41] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: jquery is just a library for javascript
[08:03:10] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: that entire block you pasted is just javascript
[08:03:16] <dmsuperman> some of that javascript relies on jquery of course
[08:03:18] <dmsuperman> but it's all javascript
[08:03:52] <icedude> The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a single level down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels to select descendant elements (grandchildren, etc.) as well
[08:03:56] <Velveeta> i believe the current transaction rate is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 jquery to 1.3 javascripts
[08:04:07] <robertmaxrees> Velveeta++
[08:04:11] <xxx1337> so i can be working on jquery on one line and the next line i can be using javascript?
[08:04:28] <Velveeta> xxx1337: when you're working on jquery, you *are* working on javascript
[08:04:38] <BillCriswell> icedude: Yeah I understand that part haha.
[08:04:38] <t432> line 11 http://pastebin.com/CdDP2Tiv
[08:04:55] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: every line is javascript
[08:05:02] <dmsuperman> xxx1337: $('somestuff') is javascript
[08:05:11] <robertmaxrees> xxx1337 jquery adds a lovely constructor that makes working with the DOM a helluva lot easier. but even using that library means you're using javascript.
[08:05:25] <icedude> it makes no sense that children work and find does not. The funny part is that all the query commands work on docFragments as well as on document object itself
[08:05:37] <BillCriswell> icedude: I guess jQuery just doesn't allow you to do that on fragements. How about doing $(frag.querySelectorAll('...')) ?
[08:05:39] <dmsuperman> t432: missing comma
[08:05:45] <robertmaxrees> do what on fragments?
[08:06:00] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/pimediqurepe/2/edit was our confusion.
[08:06:04] <dmsuperman> icedude: I don't think so, in your example you're trying to find .t inside of a docfrag and it returns 0
[08:06:13] <t432> <dmsuperman>: thats not it.
[08:06:16] <tempopirate> Cork: that worked, thank you
[08:06:21] <robertmaxrees> btw b2 IS a fragment under the hood.
[08:06:22] <dmsuperman> t432: it definitely is
[08:06:24] <robertmaxrees> *d2
[08:06:37] <dmsuperman> t432: look at the line above it
[08:07:01] <t432> <dmsuperman: thats a type, commas are there
[08:07:24] <Velveeta> are there any other typos in that example that we should know about?
[08:07:30] <Velveeta> can you do a direct copy/paste?
[08:07:48] <dmsuperman> t432: if you want us to help with your code, you need to paste your code
[08:07:51] <t432> http://pastebin.com/izvGK69k
[08:07:52] <dmsuperman> t432: your *actual* code
[08:08:10] <dmsuperman> because in the paste you're linking to, the problem is a missing comma
[08:08:29] <t432> i did simp;ivy it a little but all the required info is there.
[08:08:45] <t432> simplify*
[08:08:55] <dmsuperman> I don't think it is, because the error you're referencing isn't happening on that line either
[08:09:00] <Velveeta> i was about to say that
[08:09:04] <dmsuperman> nothing on line 11 is reading property name
[08:09:13] <Velveeta> the error you're singling out is not related to the line you're pointing it out on
[08:09:26] <edrahn> Why might the following now work?:      https://dpaste.de/sMxS
[08:09:27] <t432> have a look at line 2
[08:09:33] <icedude> $(frag.querySelectorAll('...')) has to do the trick then i guess
[08:09:35] <dmsuperman> yes, I can see that line 2 might cause that error
[08:09:39] <dmsuperman> but you're claiming the error is on line 11
[08:09:39] <Velveeta> even if .name was an object reference up above, so that js was linking that assignment by reference, it still wouldn't throw that specific error
[08:09:43] <t432> i'm using that variable
[08:09:50] <dmsuperman> the error would happen on line 2.
[08:10:11] <robertmaxrees> icedude could you explain what you're trying to do?
[08:10:15] <t432> ok, line 2 then
[08:10:18] <dmsuperman> no
[08:10:22] * Velveeta throws his hands up.
[08:10:33] <Velveeta> on line 3, you're saying it works
[08:10:38] <t432> yes
[08:10:38] <Velveeta> so it can't be throwing that error on line 2
[08:10:45] <icedude> $('.class', documentFragment) that is what im trying to do
[08:10:49] <t432> right
[08:10:53] <dmsuperman> robertmaxrees: http://jsbin.com/hocotavufazo/1/
[08:10:54] <dmsuperman> 0 0 0 1
[08:11:01] <robertmaxrees> icedude in that case, you just want var d2 = $('<div>');
[08:11:07] <t432> dmsuperman> yes, I can see that line 2 might cause that error
[08:11:10] <robertmaxrees> because that creates a doucment fragment under the hood
[08:11:40] <dmsuperman> t432: I can't help you solve your problem because you're not accuratley describing it. you claim the error is on line 11, and I'm saying that's not true
[08:11:57] <Velveeta> then you're claiming it's in line 2, but that it works in line 3, which is also not accurate
[08:12:10] <t432> nvm
[08:14:01] <edrahn> anyone?
[08:14:28] <t432> http://pastebin.com/cDgRiKJa
[08:15:01] <t432> how about now?
[08:15:03] <dmsuperman> that's still not true
[08:15:19] <t432> let me run it and double check it.
[08:15:39] <Velveeta> things don't just work on one line and not work on the very next line
[08:15:40] <robertmaxrees> re: fragments and jquery - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9522
[08:16:32] <dmsuperman> ah, interesting
[08:16:35] <dmsuperman> it's the append that failed
[08:16:45] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[08:16:49] <robertmaxrees> different nodetypes and all that.
[08:18:57] <t432> Here is the console screenshot, notice the line numbers are the same - http://postimg.org/image/lg3b6dm63/
[08:19:13] <t432> believe me now?
[08:19:32] <robertmaxrees> t432 that looks like something is getting passed around wrong, but I'm late to the party.
[08:19:40] <dmsuperman> I believe that that error is happening
[08:19:44] <dmsuperman> what you said earlier is still false
[08:19:51] <dmsuperman> the issue though is yeah
[08:20:00] <t432> whats false?
[08:20:00] <dmsuperman> the data structure you're getting on line 30 is differing from call to call
[08:20:16] <Velveeta> right, that looks like it's happening in a loop
[08:20:31] <robertmaxrees> ^^^ something somehwere is getting modified between calls.
[08:20:37] <t432> hmm
[08:20:41] <Velveeta> so use the stacktrace provided in the console, find the line that's making the call in a loop, and then set a breakpoint and inspect the value on each iteration
[08:20:58] <edrahn> Now I get: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: /newsfeed/controller_info/800000382561
[08:21:07] <edrahn> looks valid to me
[08:21:09] <robertmaxrees> edrahn what's going on?
[08:21:36] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: I'm running thise code: https://dpaste.de/sMxS
[08:21:45] <dmsuperman> edrahn: that's not an expression
[08:21:53] <dmsuperman> I'm guessing you mean regex
[08:21:53] <edrahn> and I get that error message in console
[08:22:15] <dmsuperman> which line?
[08:22:39] <dmsuperman> oh I see it
[08:22:41] <dmsuperman> $(url)
[08:22:48] <robertmaxrees> consol.log('modal click'); is broken btw.
[08:23:07] <edrahn> dmsuperman: the error is throw in jquery code
[08:23:18] <dmsuperman> the error is from $(url)
[08:23:19] <robertmaxrees> edrahn that means you're passing something around incorrectly.
[08:23:22] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: I know, I fixed it alread
[08:23:30] <dmsuperman> that makes no sense, why are you looking up an element using a url as a jquery selector
[08:23:40] <robertmaxrees> edrahn what's the value of 'url' ?
[08:24:03] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman he might be using URLs like href="#someId" and then selecting elements using that.
[08:24:05] <dmsuperman> ah fair point
[08:24:35] <robertmaxrees> this code makes some assumptions, but i wonder which specific line it's erroring on.
[08:24:57] <edrahn> dmsuperman: it doesn't get that far in the code
[08:25:15] <robertmaxrees> edrahn look at the stack trace - does it tell you anything?
[08:25:19] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: /newsfeed/controller_info/850000122203
[08:25:27] <dmsuperman> lol
[08:25:43] <robertmaxrees> edrahn also, your click binding won't ever work the way you want it to.
[08:26:12] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: the stack trace doesn't tell me anything
[08:26:16] <edrahn> why not?
[08:26:27] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on("click", "[data-toggle='modal']", function(event) {
[08:26:36] <robertmaxrees> then you call 	e.preventDefault(); - the event object is named "event"
[08:26:46] <robertmaxrees> not "e", but that's not your current problem I'm assuming.
[08:27:00] <dmsuperman> I'm surprised this code even runs enough to report the error he's having hah
[08:27:11] <edrahn> isn't that what I have?
[08:27:25] <edrahn> I already cleaned up the event.preventDefault oo.
[08:27:35] <edrahn> dmsuperman: I hack as I go :)
[08:27:40] <edrahn> but then I get stuck
[08:27:45] <robertmaxrees> edrahn also, what do you expect $menu.append("<a href='/newsfeed/controller_info/" + el + "\' data-toggle='modal'>" + el + '</a><br>'); to do?
[08:27:50] <dmsuperman> well please paste your _current_ code
[08:27:54] <robertmaxrees> el is an object, not a string.
[08:28:26] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to concat objects to strings, which will never do what you want.
[08:28:28] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: append that string it to a div
[08:28:42] <robertmaxrees> 'el' is not a string - it's a node.
[08:29:20] <edrahn> it does what I want I think
[08:29:24] <edrahn> the output look  good
[08:29:31] <robertmaxrees> you said yourself that the error is coming from that line...
[08:29:47] <edrahn> the error is thrown from jquery
[08:29:48] <robertmaxrees> mind making a jsfiddle and showing us your updated code?
[08:30:05] <robertmaxrees> right, because you're passing something that it doesn't know how to handle.
[08:30:17] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: well I get that data back from a ajax GET
[08:30:28] <Velveeta> but that doesn't mean jquery understands it
[08:30:29] <edrahn> so the code isn't the easiest to simplify
[08:30:40] <robertmaxrees> sure it is - show us the returned data.
[08:30:52] <edrahn> how would I convert it to a string?
[08:31:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't know that's what you really want to do.
[08:31:22] <Velveeta> console.log(JSON.stringify(data))
[08:31:39] <robertmaxrees> maybe you want to create a node and modify the href property and change the text of it :)
[08:41:53] <aaairc> Is there recommended way on how to deal with :hover with touch devices? The hover state doesn't seem to go away. Also $().click() seems to not work on some touch devices
[08:43:24] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: how would I convert that node to HTML?
[08:43:32] <edrahn> a.html() doesn't seem to work
[08:44:15] <robertmaxrees> edrahn could you show us the returned data from your server?
[08:49:43] <printForever> guys, how the hell do I make this work
[08:49:43] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/ewehNLW9
[08:49:47] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[08:49:53] <wa5ted> shoky_: you around
[08:50:04] <robertmaxrees> wa5ted lol calm down a little broseph.
[08:50:19] <edrahn> robertmaxrees: https://dpaste.de/u1UU
[08:50:23] <wa5ted> calm down i need both of them
[08:50:25] <wa5ted> actually
[08:50:27] <wa5ted> not need
[08:50:30] <wa5ted> but wuld like to talk to
[08:50:38] <Velveeta> need as in physically?
[08:50:55] <wa5ted> as i said
[08:50:57] <wa5ted> talk to

[08:51:36] <printForever> I am trying to do a simple + and -
[08:51:38] <drej> why? is it going to do a trick?
[08:51:45] * Velveeta stares lovingly at the url.
[08:51:57] <drej> printForever that seems like a waste
[08:51:57] <robertmaxrees> printForever can you make a fiddle?
[08:52:11] <printForever> yeah
[08:53:03] <drej> printForever http://jsfiddle.net/4eyv2djg/
[08:53:08] <drej> there's a much easier / cleaner approach
[08:53:14] <Velveeta> you could probably do that with just css, and something like a .faq_question:before element w/ content
[08:53:26] <Velveeta> yeah, like that :D
[08:54:02] <drej> its magical!
[08:54:07] <drej> but now he's spending time writing his fiddle
[08:54:11] <Velveeta> heheheh
[08:54:13] <drej> and wont see it until its done
[08:55:53] <dmsuperman> it's a learning excercise.

[09:24:08] <ElcaLc> hello
[09:24:36] <ElcaLc> How can I link an input text with an input checkbox
[09:29:11] <PyDon> Hi
[09:30:13] <PyDon> Can anyone help me? I have a selector i want to optimize. The element i am looking for is between the last  and the 10-th last element of the current level.
[09:30:51] <PyDon> So $(".myclass") browses millions of divs of the current level.
[09:31:14] <PyDon> Any idea how I can say look from bottom to up?
[09:31:46] <robertbusy> limit your selector based on the parent, instead.
[09:31:57] <robertbusy> $(someParent).find();
[09:32:36] <PyDon> The parent contains thousands divs but just two of them have the id
[09:32:51] <robertbusy> "the id" - so you could select on ID instead?
[09:33:11] <PyDon> Or class.. Hm..
[09:33:33] <PyDon> The problem is when i limit it to a div for instance it browses childs as well.
[09:33:46] <PyDon> It should not browse the childs, just the current level.
[09:33:56] <robertbusy> so you want all elements that match two selectors?
[09:34:22] <PyDon> Lets stay at the example of the class for a second
[09:34:38] <PyDon> Its a div but it means it also browses all children.
[09:34:49] <PyDon> So i know the element is just in the current level.
[09:35:46] <robertbusy> div.someClass?
[09:35:54] <robertbusy> without seeing an example of what you're trying to do it's hard to help.
[09:36:34] <PyDon> Ok, i think i found out what helped: its this
[09:37:05] <PyDon> "body".children().find("my selector")
[09:37:10] <PyDon> Does that make sense?
[09:37:25] <robertbusy> err, not really.
[09:37:33] <PyDon> Hmpfh..
[09:37:51] <robertbusy> if you want the .someClass that are direct children of body, then you want $('body').children('.someClass')
[09:38:00] <PyDon> Body has 10000 divs in a row. Every div has 1000 children. But i just want to look for the divs in the first level.
[09:38:14] <robertbusy> right ^ what I just pasted is what you want.
[09:38:16] <robertbusy> .children()
[09:38:27] <PyDon> Oh. That makes sense! Perfect!
[09:38:32] <PyDon> Thanks
[09:40:56] <Arby01> "help" hehe  using jquery mobile (for nice buttons, table reflow, etc) and path.js (for routing in single page application) and I've set ajaxEnabled, pushStateEnabled, linkBindingEnabled and hashListeningEnabled all to false to path.js can do it's job.  $("#mainTarget").html('this gets swapped out depending on route')   and url #/another-page works fine.  UNTIL after dynamically adding content
[09:40:56] <Arby01> to the div I $("#mainTarget").trigger("create") so the mobile styles get applied to the new content.  after that the path.js hash navigation no longer works.  not sure where to go from here :(
[09:43:29] <Arby01> had this same trouble when I tried to use jquery mobile with ember as well.  figured I'd simplify things and use path.js or jquery.address but same issues.
[09:57:22] <PyDon> Is there a page you recommend where i can try to benchmark jquery?
[09:57:32] <PyDon> I mean custom jquery code?
[09:58:33] <robertbusy> you mean javascript, and sure - jsperf
[09:58:55] <robertbusy> though take its results with a grain of salt.
[09:59:02] <robertbusy> microbenchmarks are a helluva drug
[09:59:05] <PyDon> Hm...
[09:59:28] <PyDon> True, i give it a try
[09:59:34] <PyDon> Thanks!!!!
[09:59:53] <robertbusy> are you trying to write efficient jquery selectors?
[10:00:06] <PyDon> Yes.
[10:00:09] <nonconvergent> Hi.
[10:00:11] <robertbusy> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/
[10:00:12] <robertbusy> read this.
[10:00:20] <PyDon> Awesome!! Thanks
[10:00:22] <robertbusy> especially http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:00:27] * nonconvergent just came to read the topic right now.
[10:01:04] <PyDon> I am a c++ developer and jquery is so much fun.
[10:01:11] <robertbusy> PyDon javascript is, too ;)
[10:02:00] <PyDon> Haha, i have seen this joke job offer once:     Developer wanted: proficient in jquery, JS optional
[10:02:05] <robertbusy> lol
[10:02:05] <nonconvergent> Um, where do I look for the correct way to grab the current value of a dom element?
[10:02:15] <robertbusy> nonconvergent define "current value" :)
[10:02:28] <PyDon> nonconvergent: .text()?
[10:02:29] <robertbusy> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a great place to start if you want to learn the basics of jquery.
[10:02:30] <nonconvergent> robertbusy: what's in the input box.
[10:02:36] <robertbusy> otherwise .val() for inputs
[10:02:36] <PyDon> .value()?
[10:02:56] <robertbusy> .value is the dom property, PyDon. .val() is the method for jquery objects.
[10:03:04] <nonconvergent> robertbusy: kay, I was looking at .val().  but it's numeric input, so thanks.
[10:03:05] <robertbusy> $('someInput').val()
[10:03:10] <PyDon> robertbusy: well i know the basics, the pure basics.
[10:03:20] <robertbusy> nonconvergent the input type doesn't matter.
[10:03:23] <robertbusy> .val() for all inputs.
[10:03:26] <PyDon> Not more not less
[10:03:30] <robertbusy> form controls, really.
[10:11:15] <gumble> if I have an post request and get 500 internal server error back...can I somehow get more details?
[10:12:24] <robertbusy> .fail(function( jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown ) {}); <- you can look at the jqXHR object, textStatus, and errorThrown.
[10:17:12] <BillCriswell> gumble: server log as well. I hope the server wouldn't give too much detailed information.
[10:17:37] <gumble> thanks
[10:21:20] <Guest38341> hey guys any1 ever try to use jquery.validation with jquery mobile?  I have a multipage setup (multi pages in a single file) trying to validate and it doesn't seem to work unless I validate on the 'page' with the actual inputs
[10:24:04] <|DZ|> The idea is you will have multiple pages with form elements you can jump between and fill out in any order you please.  At the end you'll navigate to a 'review' page and at that point in time the pages will be validated
[10:24:46] <unnu> jphase
[10:26:50] <unnu> anyone on here need a job? lol
[10:27:14] <|DZ|> any ideas guys?
[10:28:27] <gerep> Hi all. I'm with a small problem, here, I have columns with two checkboxes on to select the file and another one to make it 'active', so this second checkbox is available only if the first one is selected: https://gist.github.com/gerep/0c0a88fbd7abe3cee7a0
[10:28:29] <gerep> This is my code
[10:28:43] <gerep> I have two inputs, one with the first checkbox and the second one
[10:29:41] <gerep> The problem is that I have created a "select all" to mark all the checkboxes (the first one) but the I can't make the second checkbox active
[10:29:44] <gerep> How can I do that
[10:29:46] <gerep> ?
[10:29:49] <farbod> hi,how can i get At least and Max to my text box?
[10:30:00] <gerep> I need to activate the 'teste' function when I run the function to select all the checkboxes
[10:30:11] <NoiseEee> sounds balls
[10:38:05] <gerep> This is my doubt improved =) https://gist.github.com/gerep/7801e04d60e59898f3ec the click of #select_all should activate the $('.selectable').live, what am I doing wrong?
[10:38:34] <gerep> I'm using jquery 1.5.1
[10:39:27] <robertbusy> http://fixee.org/paste/fs4lboi/
[10:39:36] <robertbusy> had an extra }) going on.
[10:40:24] <robertbusy> also, you want .attr() if you're using such an old version of jquery.
[10:40:27] <robertbusy> .prop() was added 1.6
[10:40:54] <gerep> robertbusy, thanks a lot! =)
[10:41:03] <robertbusy> why such an old version of jquery btw?
[10:41:26] <gerep> robertbusy, old application and I'm afraid of updating it since we don't use it much
[10:41:37] <gerep> robertbusy, just controlling some datatable
[10:41:39] <robertbusy> might be worth the project to update it.
[10:41:42] <robertbusy> but okay.
[10:41:53] <gerep> robertbusy, I have that on my to-do list already ;)
[10:42:03] <gerep> robertbusy, thanks a lot for your time =)
[10:42:08] <robertbusy> fsho

[10:47:39] <gerep> robertbusy, I found the }); duplicated but still not working
[10:48:41] <gerep> robertbusy, I also don't see any error messages on the console, I'v placed a console in the .live block but nothing: http://fixee.org/paste/jq8x46i/
[10:49:21] <gerep> robertbusy, any other idea? =)
[10:49:35] <Horacsio> I have this 2 links for 2 dif languages. and the pages have several anchors. how to change language regarding the anchor point of the page?
[10:49:49] <gerep> robertbusy, on clicking on a specific checkbox it works, it doesn't work when I call the $('#select_all').click(function(event) {
[10:49:57] <ravigehlot> This code: http://jsfiddle.net/qpqy8s7L/ works but the text is fanding as well. How can the image fade without affecting the tex?
[10:50:20] <robertbusy> gerep could you please create a fiddle?
[10:50:30] <gerep> robertbusy, sure
[10:51:40] <gerep> robertbusy, http://jsfiddle.net/jaqycpwf/
[10:52:17] <robertbusy> okay - so how do I replicate your issue?
[10:52:47] <printForever> drej, sorry I had to go out for a minute
[10:52:59] <printForever> I wrote the fiddle but forgot to send you the link
[10:53:08] <gerep> robertbusy, when you click on the left checkbox of an item, it will activate the left checkbox of this item, when you click on the top checkbox (select all), the right checkboxes aren't activated
[10:53:12] <printForever> I know about the CSS / toggle thing, but its not what I am looking for
[10:53:32] <gerep> robertbusy, "it will activate the RIGHT checkbox of this item"
[10:53:35] <robertbusy> printForever because you have to activate them first...
[10:54:22] <gtristan> Hi all, I have a small question about jQuery ajax requests
[10:54:36] <robertbusy> oh i see.
[10:54:46] <robertbusy> gerep you're not triggering the change event on them.
[10:55:02] <gerep> robertbusy, yes, I thought that using .live would do that :)
[10:55:08] <gerep> robertbusy, is there a way of doing this?
[10:55:11] <gtristan> if I call $.get() twice, on the same domain/path, will jQuery invoke the response callback with the correct corresponding response ?
[10:55:25] <gtristan> for both callbacks I mean ?
[10:55:43] <robertbusy> .live() binds a listener - you need to explicitly trigger change on your selectables, gerep - http://jsfiddle.net/jaqycpwf/2/
[10:55:50] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/
[10:55:58] <robertbusy> gtristan huh?
[10:56:09] <gtristan> I ask because, I have an order sensitive QUnit test suite, and things broke down horribly when we added a continuous polling object into the test environment
[10:56:42] <Horacsio> |DZ|: bias.baannng.com
[10:56:52] <gerep> robertbusy, thank you so much =)
[10:56:57] <gerep> robertbusy, working perfectly ;)
[10:57:08] <robertbusy> cool
[10:57:10] <printForever> robertbusy I think I did it correctly
[10:57:25] <printForever> I activated the slideToggle correctly
[10:57:34] <printForever> but I cant get - and + to work
[10:57:48] <Horacsio> |DZ|: Im using validate plugin there
[10:57:53] <gtristan> robertbusy, since we are testing say... $.get ("/master_revisions") ... and at the same time have an object in background which pulls /master_revisions on a regular basis (polling for changes) ... I am curious if jQuery get's confused just because I have 2 active GET requests with the same path/parameters
[10:58:18] <|DZ|> Hora - look at my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8o231gpv/
[10:58:48] <gtristan> if that's not the case, then my problem might be in QUnit (for the record, no it's not important to me to make 2 parallel requests for the SAME data, however it doesnt justify jQuery / QUnit to break, IMO)
[10:58:54] <Horacsio> its ok!
[10:59:45] <Horacsio> it works! I filled all fields as needed and it sent valid true
[11:00:15] <|DZ|> yes it works when you hit the first button
[11:00:18] <robertbusy> gtristan that depends on a variety of factors, but i'd personally not run two ajax requests at the same time.
[11:00:24] <|DZ|> go to the second page (using the link) and hit that button
[11:00:28] <|DZ|> it will say the form is valid
[11:00:31] <|DZ|> when clearly it isnt
[11:00:34] <robertbusy> they're asynchronous either way, so order shouldn't matter.
[11:00:58] <printForever> robertbusy, Horacsio, can either of you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/
[11:01:30] <gtristan> robertbusy, err, not run 2 ajax requests at the same time *at all* ?
[11:01:32] <gtristan> really ?
[11:02:19] <robertbusy> i generally don't need to.  do either of the requests rely on the other?
[11:02:20] <gtristan> granted, running 2 against the same path is something I don't need, I still expect the library to rememeber that *this* requests goes with *that* response callback
[11:02:46] <stuned> http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/mcfz2vxw/ hello, i am workn on some jquery for shool. my example one works fine but dont get rid of the second one. ty for help
[11:02:48] <gtristan> robertbusy, I will certainly need to indeed
[11:03:01] <robertbusy> gtristan though I'm confused about what you're doing and where things are failing - can you share a simplified example of your code?
[11:04:04] <gtristan> robertbusy, consider that you have 4 or 5 different data types, that you pull from /foo, /bar, /baz etc... you are constantly polling /revisions to check if you need to reload some content from one of the various sources, then you pull those separate contents simultaneously, and notify any changes so that views can update (MVC-like but in the browser)
[11:05:01] <gtristan> robertbusy, that's the use case, but I don't think there is a problem with that, I'm currently just trying to figure out why 2 requests to the same path cause my test suite to fail... and I was suspicious that it may be something unsupported in jQuery
[11:05:24] <robertbusy> wouldn't be unsupported, but I wonder what your code looks like.
[11:05:25] <gtristan> robertbusy, anyhow, I've never been on this channel before and thanks for your paying attention :)
[11:05:57] <gtristan> I do have a meeting coming up right now, but I'll look into making a brief test case
[11:06:51] <gtristan> robertbusy, the thing is, the code which caused the bug in my tests, is code that *I* consider to be a bug, but for a different reason (i.e. the "Revisions" polling object is unconditionally created at global scope)
[11:07:05] <robertbusy> mostly just curious about the code - no need for it to function, but either way.
[11:07:07] <gtristan> that's something that I consider to be a bug, but doesnt explain the problems I'm seeing ;-)
[11:07:47] <gtristan> robertbusy, sorry I gotta run for a bit, but if I can show what's going on in a simple enough test case I'll certainly let you know :)
[11:07:54] <robertbusy> okay
[11:09:48] <stuned> :-/
[11:10:59] <robertbusy> stuned what are you trying to do?
[11:11:24] <stuned> collecting data
[11:11:43] <stuned> on click and send it to my cookie function to save it there
[11:12:26] <robertbusy> that's a really strange way to do that - you know you can do $('tr a').click() instead of running .each(), right?
[11:12:27] <stuned> example one worls
[11:13:04] <stuned> example 2 is my problem
[11:13:29] <stuned> rovertbusy: no i aint knew dat
[11:13:31] <robertbusy> this code could be done in far fewer lines and could be made to work for both 'tr a', and '.box a'
[11:13:41] <stuned> but hm yes i remember
[11:13:53] <stuned> for both????
[11:14:04] <stuned> even if the data is in spans?
[11:14:06] <stuned> hm.
[11:14:17] <robertbusy> you're repeating stuff :)
[11:14:54] <stuned> hm ye :D i am new to this all
[11:15:13] <robertbusy> did you write the first example yourself?
[11:15:54] <stuned> no my friend from school
[11:16:05] <robertbusy> so this is homework?
[11:16:21] <stuned> just a small part of it
[11:16:28] <robertbusy> oaky.
[11:16:42] <robertbusy> i'd start by simplifying - remove the .each() use first.
[11:16:55] <stuned> hm ok
[11:16:59] <robertbusy> figure out how to get the alert() (or a console.log()) to fire when you click on something.
[11:17:03] <xxx1337> anyone think they can make the white sneeze guard overlay on magnific popup a white one? http://jsfiddle.net/benfosterdev/vGAsL/
[11:18:00] <stuned> but why use first and not each?
[11:18:09] <stuned> i have to trigger all boxes
[11:18:18] <robertbusy> stuned .click() runs .each() for you under the hood.
[11:18:27] <stuned> k
[11:19:03] <stuned> $(".box").first(function(i, el) {
[11:19:06] <stuned> like this?
[11:19:09] <robertbusy> huh?
[11:19:14] <robertbusy> why are you using .first()?
[11:19:41] <arschmitz> robertbusy: lack of understanding "i'd start by simplifying - remove the .each() use first." :/
[11:19:53] <stuned> ye :-/
[11:19:56] <robertbusy> right - your first step is to not use .each()
[11:20:10] <xxx1337> nevermind i got it
[11:20:35] <stuned> but what should i use instead of each.
[11:20:38] <robertbusy> nothing.
[11:20:44] <stuned> and why, it works for the first example.
[11:20:44] <robertbusy> $('tr a').click() is all your need.
[11:20:49] <stuned> ah ok
[11:20:52] <robertbusy> "it works" is terrible reasoning.
[11:22:41] <stuned> like this? jsfiddle.net/ca8nao2s/1/
[11:23:08] <stuned> yes i indeed, "it works" is a terrible reason :D
[11:24:01] <robertbusy> that gives me a 404
[11:24:07] <stuned> now i need to collect the data
[11:24:13] <stuned> a 404?
[11:24:15] <robertbusy> try again with the url.
[11:24:29] <ravigehlot> This code: http://jsfiddle.net/qpqy8s7L/ works but the text is fanding as well. How can the image fade without affecting the tex?
[11:24:46] <stuned> http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/1/
[11:25:29] <stuned> well now i have a small code to trigger it
[11:25:34] <stuned> is more clean right?
[11:25:36] <robertbusy> stuned slow down
[11:25:44] <stuned> ok
[11:25:44] <robertbusy> you can combine both handlers into one.
[11:25:54] <stuned> hm
[11:28:04] <stuned> robertbusy: how?
[11:28:51] <robertbusy> same way as before.
[11:29:19] <robertbusy> you could do $('tr a, .box a') or $('tr, .box').find('a')
[11:30:57] <stuned> but why does my cellCollection dont work in example 2
[11:31:19] <robertbusy> stuned back up - start small.
[11:33:26] <axilla> ravigehlot: use RGBA instead of opacity
[11:33:41] <axilla> that will change the opacity of only the element selected and not the entire div
[11:34:21] <stuned> robertbusy: ok
[11:34:45] <robertbusy> combine both your click handlers into one.
[11:34:58] <robertbusy> and get that to fire an alert or conslle log when you click something.
[11:35:12] <stuned> k. brb
[11:37:46] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/
[11:38:24] <stuned> robertbusy: http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/3/ :)
[11:39:07] <stuned> this foxynna send me spam too :(
[11:39:50] <|DZ|> can any tell me why this won't validate on the second page: http://jsfiddle.net/8o231gpv/
[11:39:51] <arschmitz> stuned: will they wont be back now
[11:40:43] <robertbusy> stuned you don't have any links in the code you shared...
[11:40:55] <dmsuperman> I think you have to run .validate after the elements are appended to the form |DZ|
[11:41:12] <dmsuperman> I believe it sets up the bindings at the time you call it
[11:41:14] <|DZ|> dmsuperman - you mean re-run validate()
[11:41:19] <dmsuperman> yeah or that
[11:41:22] <|DZ|> hmm
[11:41:26] <printForever> guys, come the hell on...
[11:41:29] <stuned> robertbusy: ? i do
[11:41:33] <printForever> can someone check this script out
[11:41:34] <robertbusy> printForever
[11:41:36] <printForever> its 60 seconds
[11:41:45] <printForever> I just need to know how to call the IF
[11:41:53] <robertbusy> printForever didn't somebody answer your question earlier?
[11:41:53] <stuned> robertbusy: line 21 & 48
[11:41:57] <printForever> no
[11:42:10] <dmsuperman> Oh I see you're adding the rules dynamically
[11:42:14] <dmsuperman> I've never done that
[11:42:14] <robertbusy> stuned ah, you're right.
[11:42:39] <dmsuperman> still, the order may play a part in the issue
[11:42:41] <printForever> robertbusy no one gave an answer about the script
[11:43:07] <dmsuperman> printForever: yes, they suggested CSS
[11:43:14] <dmsuperman> with a :before
[11:43:20] <printForever> I know about the CSS solution
[11:43:20] <robertbusy> printForever http://jsfiddle.net/4eyv2djg/
[11:43:28] <robertbusy> why can't you do that then?
[11:43:36] <printForever> but I wanted to do it via jQuery
[11:43:41] <printForever> and the script is pretty good
[11:43:43] <robertbusy> any particular reason?
[11:43:45] <dmsuperman> why?
[11:43:57] <robertbusy> also your .each() is totally unnecessary
[11:44:00] <printForever> yes, because the script is great and CSS isn't always reliable
[11:44:07] <robertbusy> since when?
[11:44:34] <robertbusy> you want it so when you click on a question it gets a + or - on it?
[11:44:42] <printForever> yes
[11:44:43] <robertbusy> depending on if it's opened or closed?
[11:44:53] <printForever> how do I know when its open or closed
[11:44:56] <printForever> in slideToggle
[11:45:04] <printForever> I need that to create an IF
[11:45:10] <printForever> I tried by checking if its visible
[11:45:13] <printForever> but it doesent work
[11:45:20] <stuned> robertbusy: but now how to collect the data for both examples. i dont get it where u want me..
[11:45:31] <printForever> I want to find out why, because I'm pretty sure I wrote everything 100% correct
[11:45:54] <robertbusy> printForever it's not obviously :) i'll show you a cleaner way to do this. one sec.
[11:46:02] <printForever> :(
[11:46:05] <robertbusy> stuned okay, so what data do you need for each bit?
[11:46:44] <printForever> robertbusy thnaks
[11:47:55] <printForever> my idea behind the script was to make it bulletproof as much as possible
[11:48:04] <printForever> I thought I wrote everything perfectly
[11:48:10] <printForever> I got no error from the console
[11:48:22] <stuned> robertbusy: in the first example i need the data in each line from the tr. in example 2 i need the data in the span's of each "major div" (.box) ... everything behind Title#
[11:49:35] <dmsuperman> printForever: http://jsfiddle.net/bL9ehq96/
[11:50:59] <robertbusy> stuned okay, one sec.
[11:51:45] <phoenixsun> what is the right to approach to use to parse xml? Ie read it an xml document to some object and then be apple to pick out the attribute that you want?
[11:51:47] <dmsuperman> http://jsfiddle.net/bL9ehq96/1/ I should say
[11:52:35] <dmsuperman> wow. fail. http://jsfiddle.net/bL9ehq96/3/ I mean lol. brain farts
[11:53:36] <printForever> dmsuperman I found that on stackoverflow
[11:53:41] <printForever> I am not interested in that solution
[11:53:47] <printForever> I want to build my own script
[11:53:51] <printForever> and learn something
[11:54:00] <printForever> not just copy/paste from stackoverwlof
[11:54:06] <printForever> *stackoverflow
[11:54:07] <dmsuperman> this isn't a copy/paste
[11:54:08] <dmsuperman> I just wrote it
[11:54:13] <dmsuperman> it's to _show_ you the solution
[11:54:17] <dmsuperman> so you can implement it in your own way
[11:54:19] <dmsuperman> to learn something ;)
[11:54:38] <printForever> :) I've seen your solution on stackoverflow
[11:54:52] <dmsuperman> why would you copy/paste anything if your intent is to learn?
[11:55:27] <printForever> I am askin for help
[11:55:31] <printForever> to analyze my code
[11:55:34] <printForever> and where I am wrong
[11:55:37] <buzzlewoo> any recommendations on jQuery sliders?
[11:55:40] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/
[11:55:44] <printForever> why this doesent work?
[11:55:50] <printForever> why doesent it change + and -
[11:55:54] <robertbusy> why are you bidning inside of an .each()?
[11:56:11] <printForever> because I can have multiple accordions
[11:56:26] <robertbusy> why not find the relevant one when you click a link?
[11:56:44] <printForever> because of multiple accordions
[11:56:50] <robertbusy> that doesn't make any sense.
[11:56:53] <dmsuperman> $('.faq_question .faq_answer').on('click'
[11:56:54] <printForever> its easier to have 1 selector, then write multiple
[11:57:16] <robertbusy> $(this).closest('li').find('.faq-answer') <- this should work fine
[11:57:35] <printForever> but its working right now
[11:57:39] <printForever> its how it is
[11:57:48] <robertbusy> obviously it's not working ;)
[11:57:53] <printForever> :(
[11:57:55] <printForever> but...
[11:58:05] <printForever> it... it is, it does
[11:58:05] <robertbusy> http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/4/
[11:58:08] <dmsuperman> if you want to learn you have to accept that some of your approaches are wrong. it happens
[11:58:13] <robertbusy> i'd do something like this instead.
[11:58:28] <printForever> :(
[11:58:38] <printForever> I wanted to put everything in toggleSlide
[11:58:44] <robertbusy> don't do that.
[11:58:47] <printForever> ah...
[11:58:49] <robertbusy> those toggles are implicit.
[11:58:52] <robertbusy> instead of explicit.
[11:59:09] <printForever> I f-ed up
[11:59:11] <robertbusy> http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/5/
[11:59:15] <printForever> for thinking I can use toggle
[11:59:33] <printForever> I thought to switch to slideDown and slideUp with assigning the clasess
[11:59:34] <robertbusy> hold up - you COULD use toggle, but it's not nearly as simple as what I just showed you.
[11:59:52] <printForever> can you tell me where I f-ed up?
[12:00:11] <printForever> what should I have done to create toggleSlide work?
[12:00:14] <robertbusy> printForever for starters, you were binding in an .each()
[12:00:15] <printForever> callback?
[12:00:24] <stuned> i also made a trigger without each :D
[12:00:28] <stuned> and i am glad now :D
[12:00:41] <robertbusy> stuned so in your first example, what data do you need?
[12:01:05] <stuned> content1#1  content1#2  content1#3  content1#4  content1#5  content1#6
[12:01:25] <printForever> robertbusy its not working http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/4/
[12:01:30] <stuned> like this: http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/1/
[12:01:46] <printForever> I mean, it doesent change anything
[12:02:11] <robertbusy> printForever http://jsfiddle.net/pet2dr0t/5/
[12:02:25] <robertbusy> stuned get away from the old example :)
[12:03:18] <stuned> robertbusy i am away from it. just to show the output..
[12:03:21] <stuned> :)
[12:03:23] <printForever> robertbusy isnt it better and faster to use toggleSlide instead of slideDown slideUp
[12:03:36] <robertbusy> printForever it's better to be explicit than implicit.
[12:03:42] <stuned> robertbusy: cause u ask me what i need
[12:03:42] <printForever> ok
[12:03:45] <robertbusy> explicitly have the code do what you want and you'll run into fewer bugs.
[12:04:10] <printForever> robertbusy you're right... I wanted to doo too much with little knowledge
[12:04:19] <stuned> robertbusy OLD http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/1/ NEW http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/6h3nsLLc/
[12:04:19] <robertbusy> it's not about that, but OK.
[12:04:58] <printForever> robertbusy well...
[12:05:04] <robertbusy> stuned so using what you've got now, determine if you're in a table or div and, depending on what you're in, display something saying as much.
[12:05:14] <robertbusy> so if the click was in a table, alert "table".  etc.
[12:05:44] <stuned> i dont know how could i do that
[12:05:50] <robertbusy> printForever not "well" - it's nit about being "smart" or "dumb" or "lacking knowledge".  in this case it was literally that what you really wanted was to do an explicit check a little different.
[12:05:54] <stuned> can you show me an example?
[12:05:57] <robertbusy> stuned check out .closest()
[12:06:02] <robertbusy> !g jquery api closest
[12:06:03] <b-ot> robertbusy: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[12:06:05] <stuned> k
[12:12:22] <printForever> thank you robertbusy
[12:12:35] <robertbusy> fshosho
[12:12:48] <printForever> I need to read up a little bit more
[12:12:56] <robertbusy> learn.jquery.com is a great place to start.

[12:42:37] <FernandoBasso> I have some elements that are dynamically inserted into the DOM and some lines of code with setTimeout() to make those elements slideUP() after 10 secs. I now I can run those lines again after adding the elements to the DOM, but, is there another way, like, for instance, we do $('body').on('click', 'some selector', doSth) ?
[12:42:52] <FernandoBasso> I know*
[12:44:14] <RiskyShenanigan> Hi, I am a novice front-end developer and am currently creating my portfolio site. Do you consider it noobish to use plugins for certain functionality?
[12:44:27] <stevenc_> Hi. Can you resize the browser and click in the top left. I have a file called jsutilities that was coded by someone else and i am integrating it into a Drupal theme...its throwing a few errors though :/
[12:44:29] <RiskyShenanigan> Should I be using jQuery at all to showcase to employers?
[12:44:31] <stevenc_> http://dev.semgeeks.com:8888/nrghome/
[12:44:59] <Ccdifh> I need to set somthing for the inputs which has the data-key=1, how can I get it?
[12:45:55] <edrahn> I'm getting this error: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: /newsfeed/controller_info/800000382561
[12:46:06] <edrahn> but I can't seem to reproduce it on jsfiddle.net
[12:46:18] <kylegoetz> Why would $('table') give me an object that has an id, but $('table').attr('id') return undefined?
[12:46:18] <edrahn> what are some reasons for getting that error message?
[12:46:37] <FernandoBasso> RiskyShenanigan: You can use jQuery and plugins all you want. Just make sure you don't overuse plugins so that your page won't slow down to download and everything else.
[12:47:38] <FernandoBasso> kylegoetz: $('table') returns a list.
[12:47:49] <FernandoBasso> You could do $('table')[0].id or something like that.
[12:47:53] <kylegoetz> Fernando, so then $('table')[1].attr('id')
[12:47:56] <kylegoetz> also undefined
[12:48:18] <FernandoBasso> When you do [0], [1] you lose the jqueryness of the object.
[12:48:23] <kylegoetz> ah, gotcha, thanks!
[12:48:28] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/1fz50z1y/7/ There any way anyone can help me figure this out.. It may be more complicated than someone would want to dig into. But if you view that fiddle I am trying to generate a href link. Clicking the add to cart and selecting a quantiy needs to give me a string like /cart/p123_q2   where p is the item number you get when you click the add to cart icon and the q is the
[12:48:28] <phelix> quantity from the drop down.
[12:48:56] <Ccdifh> http://jsfiddle.net/n66dgmbd/
[12:49:03] <Ccdifh> why doesn't works
[12:50:30] <FernandoBasso> Ccdifh: For some reason I can't open the link.
[12:50:37] <FernandoBasso> It seems that my dns is broken...
[12:50:41] <stuned> robertbusy: r u there?
[12:53:31] <stuned> i ned help on "example 2" http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/4/  i want to collect the data like in example 1. any idear how i can do this without td's
[12:54:59] <Ccdifh> http://jsfiddle.net/n66dgmbd/
[12:55:01] <Ccdifh> this link?
[12:55:33] <dmsuperman> I don't see any HTML in your fiddle Ccdifh
[12:55:40] <dmsuperman> or errors.
[12:56:16] <Ccdifh> All what I nee to do is set something into the input wich have the same data-key that checkbox input
[12:57:19] <dmsuperman> Ccdifh: you'll need to use .filter for that
[12:57:30] <dmsuperman> to filter your input[type='text'] collection
[12:57:42] <drej> dmsuperman yo mind if i /msg you for a sec?
[12:57:44] <dmsuperman> right now you're doing an if check which just compares the first textbox on the page
[12:57:47] <dmsuperman> sure drej
[12:58:29] <Ccdifh> really
[12:58:39] <Ccdifh> I don't know how will get you tell me
[12:59:38] <dmsuperman> Ccdifh: I would start with API docs: http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[13:03:50] <stuned> dmsuperman can u look at my one too?
[13:03:53] <stuned> http://jsfiddle.net/karlradikarl/ca8nao2s/4/
[13:04:10] <Ccdifh> Ok, that I understand but how can I to get not only the first checked
[13:05:34] <dmsuperman> I have no idea what you're trying to do stuned
[13:06:17] <stuned> i am tryin to collect the data out of the boxes. in example 2 all the data between the <span></span>
[13:06:25] <stuned> like i did in example 1
[13:10:19] <dmsuperman> stuned: how about this, I rewrote your example 1: http://jsfiddle.net/ca8nao2s/5/
[13:10:49] <stuned> example one was done. only need a soliution for
[13:10:52] <stuned> 2
[13:11:14] <stuned> dmsuperman: and you broke the example 1
[13:11:25] <stuned> cause the last cell dont need to be collected
[13:11:29] <METEMEDO> halp! i have an array of items (objects) and i want to remove one of them based on its 'id' field
[13:12:07] <METEMEDO> like $.each(temposActivos, function() { if(this.id === accao.id) { temposActivos.remove(this); }}
[13:12:24] <phelix> http://jsfiddle.net/1fz50z1y/10/ no matter what item i click on its only giving me the results for the first item. Clicking on Add to cart on any area returns the results only of the first item. Anyone knw how I can fix this?
[13:13:43] <dmsuperman> stuned: http://jsfiddle.net/ca8nao2s/6/ fine this then
[13:13:46] <dmsuperman> to remove the link cell
[13:13:56] <dmsuperman> but the point is to show you how to fix example 2
[13:13:59] <dmsuperman> by fixing example 1
[13:14:11] <stuned> example 1 not need to be changed. i need a solution for example 1!!
[13:14:29] <stuned> for example 2
[13:14:35] <dmsuperman> then follow my example 1
[13:14:37] <stuned> 2 is the point
[13:14:45] <dmsuperman> because it's the same solution for both.
[13:14:46] <stuned> i can?
[13:14:53] <stuned> hm ok let me try
[13:15:16] <stuned> but 2 dont have tr
[13:15:30] <stuned> and between the div are spans
[13:15:41] <dmsuperman> right, it's not _exactly_ the same code
[13:15:46] <dmsuperman> you need to adjust the markup to match
[13:15:49] <dmsuperman> but the general solution is the same
[13:15:56] <stuned> ok
[13:17:18] <METEMEDO> any idea?
[13:17:55] <dmsuperman> METEMEDO: what is the question?
[13:18:15] <METEMEDO> i have an array of items (objects) and i want to remove one of them based on its 'id' field
[13:18:25] <METEMEDO> like $.each(temposActivos, function() { if(this.id === accao.id) { temposActivos.remove(this); }}
[13:18:32] <dmsuperman> right, so what is the question?
[13:18:47] <METEMEDO> how do i accomplish this?
[13:18:48] <dmsuperman> looks like you're already on the right path
[13:19:36] <METEMEDO> except that there is no remove() method
[13:19:54] <dmsuperman> so you're asking how to remove an element from an array?
[13:19:59] <METEMEDO> yes
[13:20:08] <dmsuperman> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete
[13:21:07] <METEMEDO> hmm so can i just do delete(this); inside the loop?
[13:21:38] <dmsuperman> read that page ;)
[13:29:59] <METEMEDO> does this look good? http://pastebin.com/SDDQhXgp
[13:30:27] <drej> i mean ... its no meagan fox
[13:30:29] <drej> but it'll do
[13:30:32] <METEMEDO> xD
[13:31:55] <dmsuperman> METEMEDO: have you tried running it?
[13:32:24] <METEMEDO> i'm about to
[13:41:45] <MikeD_> is there ui widget that makes the scroll wheel increment/decrement the value in a type=number input?
[13:42:07] <MikeD_> hmm... .spinner() does
[13:42:49] <robertbusy> ridin' spinnaz
[13:50:59] <MikeD_> in ie10 there's a weird arrow... that once you click then you can hover... and it flips really fast.  is that set via options?
[13:52:12] <robertbusy> whatnow?
[13:54:07] <MikeD_> appearancewise, each arrow is an updown... probably because IE has mistaken the sprite for a full image.. so there's 2 updowns, the top is up and the bottom is down
[13:54:31] <robertbusy> "updown"??
[13:54:33] <MikeD_> and functionwise, if you click on up it increments once but then if you hover on the up it continues to increment
[13:54:47] <MikeD_> yeah... and UP and a DOWN  = updown
[13:54:56] <robertbusy> up and down what?
[13:54:58] <robertbusy> image?
[13:54:59] <MikeD_> looks like two elevator controls on top of each other
[13:55:08] <MikeD_> yeah, in the spinner
[13:55:20] <robertbusy> could you make a fiddle?
[13:55:23] <robertbusy> pretty sure i'm lost.
[13:55:26] <MikeD_> i'd take a screenshot, but our proxy would make it difficult to post anywhere
[13:56:02] <MikeD_> hmm... http://jqueryui.com/spinner/ looks like i'd have expected.
[13:57:17] <MikeD_> i bet it's because the example doesn't have type=number
[14:01:36] <MikeD_> *shrug*  nope, i removed that type=number and it's still weird.  no doubt it's a borkd environment
[14:01:48] <MikeD_> thanks for making me check
[14:42:52] <Arby01> "help" hehe  using jquery mobile (for nice buttons, table reflow, etc) and path.js (for routing in single page application) and I've set ajaxEnabled, pushStateEnabled, linkBindingEnabled and hashListeningEnabled all to false to path.js can do it's job.  $("#mainTarget").html('this gets swapped out depending on route')   and url #/another-page works fine.  UNTIL after dynamically adding content
[14:42:52] <Arby01> to the div I $("#mainTarget").trigger("create") so the mobile styles get applied to the new content.  after that the path.js hash navigation no longer works.  not sure where to go from here :(
[15:52:47] <benlieb> I'm using bootstrap modal with data-remote. The url in data-remote is a relative link, but the remote request fails on pages with https: "was  loaded over HTTPS, but displayed insecure content from 'http://thedomain.com/the/relative/url/in/my/file: this content should also be loaded over HTTPS."
[15:53:15] <benlieb> Any ideas how to fix?
[15:53:56] <benlieb> Why doesn't bootstrap load the relative url with https, like the page it's on?
[15:56:32] <brettfrable> i hate bootstrap
[15:56:38] <robertbusy> word
[15:57:08] <brettfrable> you just need a nice grid framework
[15:57:32] <brettfrable> i recommend bourbons neat grid system
[15:59:22] <robertbusy> we use a modified version of bootstrap's grid here and like it, actually.
[15:59:25] <robertbusy> it's the JS we don't like.
[16:00:33] <brettfrable> does their grid system let you have semantic class names yet
[16:02:26] <robertbusy> spambots :(
[16:03:45] <brettfrable> yeah i got a spambot
[16:04:04] <robertbusy> i kicked and banned them.  second one today
[16:04:43] <isadora3> i'm trying to do horizontal infinite scrolling ... listening for a scroll event on window only kicks in my handler when i reach the edge of the page (i want to load new content when the user is x amount of pixels away from the edge, not at it ) ... listening for a scroll event on my scrollable container
[16:05:28] <isadora3> gives me no way to determine if i'm nearning the edge or not (i just get total scroll of my container, but not with respect to anything else)
[16:05:51] <isadora3> anyway i can achieve this?
[16:06:49] <brettfrable> so you want to load more content when say the user is 50px from the end of the window?
[16:06:59] <isadora3> correct
[16:07:42] <isadora3> i'm not sure i was very clear, scroll event on my container fires with regularity, scroll event on window only fires once i hit the edge
[16:08:47] <isadora3> but in the former case, container.scrollLeft() just grows and grows and grows
[16:09:50] <brettfrable> oh like a swimlane
[16:10:02] <brettfrable> can i see your code
[16:10:13] <brettfrable> jsbin
[16:11:52] <isadora3> there's really no relevant code...$(window).scroll fires only when i hit the edge, and i have no way around this
[16:12:22] <brettfrable> well if i can't see your code
[16:12:25] <brettfrable> i can't help you
[16:13:39] <robertbusy> sounds like you're binding to the scroll event of a child of window.
[16:16:34] <robertbusy> and when that container reaches the end of its scroll, it hits the window.
[16:17:18] <wa5ted> bored as fuck need somehing to do
[16:18:15] <brettfrable> get wa5ted
[16:18:37] <wa5ted> isadora3: perhaps a small example of your use case
[16:18:42] <wa5ted> might work better

[16:50:15] <robertbusy> oh - hah
[16:50:18] <robertbusy> my bad.
[16:51:07] <robertbusy> okay - so what are you trying to figure out here?
[16:52:50] <isthisreallife> why doesnt div with id 'overly' cover div with id 'frame'
[16:52:57] <robertbusy> woah woops
[16:53:16] <robertbusy> z-index?
[16:53:41] <isthisreallife> you ask me?;d im total beginner
[16:53:53] <robertbusy> did you try playing around with z-index?
[16:53:59] <isthisreallife> nope
[16:54:31] <robertbusy> i'd give that a shot and see if that works.
[16:59:19] <wa5ted> brettfrable: so what od you think
[16:59:21] <wa5ted> do*
[17:10:51] <BLaDe^> hi all - im trying to search a data attribute (which is a list separated by ,) and coming up short...
[17:11:00] <BLaDe^> Shouldn't $('table tbody tr[data-zones*="(?:^|,) + val + "(?:,|$)"]') work?
[17:12:03] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[17:12:45] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: I'd use .filter()
[17:13:08] <BLaDe^> BillCriswell: yeah that was my next try--- I figured a selector might be faster though
[17:13:19] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: Also, does data-zones change at all programmatically?
[17:13:31] <BLaDe^> BillCriswell: it's outputted on the server, there are some clientside filtering abilities though
[17:13:49] <BLaDe^> so no, it'll never change once the page has loaded
[17:13:51] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: Ah ok, cause that would only look at the attribute as it's output to the page.
[17:13:55] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do, BLaDe^?
[17:14:17] <BLaDe^> robertmaxrees: search a data attribute for a value then show/hide elements based on that
[17:14:21] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Think just a basic $.inArray()
[17:14:46] <BillCriswell> $('tr').filter(function(){ return $(this).data('zones').indexOf(val) > -1; });
[17:15:10] <BLaDe^> BillCriswell:  that is flawed because if the data attribute held 123 and I was searching for 23 it'd match
[17:15:16] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: You could do data-zones="[foo,bar,baz]" and actually get an array and use .indexOf() or $.inArray()
[17:15:39] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: Didn't let me finish. :-p
[17:17:44] <BLaDe^> seems inefficient doing it this way, let me step back once more
[17:18:18] <BLaDe^> I have var toShow = [2, 60, 100];  and ~500 tr's with data-zones="[5,1,100]"   or any number of other ids
[17:18:30] <BLaDe^> I want to show all tr's which have an id which is in toShow
[17:18:47] <BLaDe^> right now, it seems iterating through toShow then filtering 500 tr's per id is the solution... but that seems slow
[17:20:54] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: I think a hash table type deal might be quicker?
[17:21:02] <BLaDe^> I have an idea.. if I prefix each id with "z" then *= "z" + var
[17:21:09] <BLaDe^> that should be fast and easy, right?
[17:21:14] <robertmaxrees> i'd move your data to an object and go from there.
[17:21:25] <robertmaxrees> filtering/etc on data attributes is going to be painful.
[17:22:05] <BillCriswell> BLaDe^: An attribute selector isn't going to make it any quicker, especially if it doesn't work with querySelectorAll.
[17:22:47] <wa5ted> brettfrable: ?
[17:23:04] <brettfrable> work looks good.
[17:23:10] <brettfrable> i'd really focus a lot on being ux
[17:23:16] <brettfrable> if that's your thing.
[17:23:24] <brettfrable> the html/css/js chops are good
[17:23:25] <wa5ted> well im in web
[17:23:30] <wa5ted> mostly code
[17:23:33] <wa5ted> thanks
[17:23:41] <wa5ted> design is just a compontent im trying to learn
[17:23:44] <brettfrable> but ux is is user experience
[17:23:49] <wa5ted> multi disciplinary
[17:23:53] <brettfrable> and the user experience is a pretty good field to be in
[17:23:58] <wa5ted> yup
[17:24:05] <wa5ted> it encompassses a lot
[17:24:09] <brettfrable> ux isn't really design in my opinion
[17:24:15] <brettfrable> it's how the user is going to use app/site
[17:24:25] <wa5ted> yup
[17:24:29] <BillCriswell> design is a funny word.
[17:24:30] <brettfrable> it's the hierarchy or architecture etc
[17:24:31] <wa5ted> but yo umust design that
[17:24:41] <wa5ted> that meaning the experience
[17:24:42] <brettfrable> or wireframe it really
[17:24:44] <wa5ted> craft it
[17:24:46] <wa5ted> rather
[17:24:48] <brettfrable> have a designer, design
[17:24:55] <wa5ted> yes exactly
[17:25:03] <wa5ted> ux is more like wrieframing for me
[17:25:07] <wa5ted> the rest is designing
[17:25:12] <wa5ted> adding color, images, etc.

[18:10:27] <OmicroN_> can't find the dev tools in chrome
[18:10:31] <OmicroN_> oh like desktop chrome?
[18:10:36] <erming> yeah
[18:10:45] <OmicroN_> yeah this is a mobile specific problem and a weird one at that
[18:11:10] <OmicroN_> site that i made for a friend and his parents for there landscapping biz
[18:11:16] <OmicroN_> using the jquery fullcalendar plugin
[18:11:30] <erming> http://www.sitepoint.com/use-mobile-emulation-mode-chrome/
[18:11:33] <OmicroN_> and i guess recently like today all of a sudden the calendar wont load on at&t devices
[18:11:40] <erming> worth a try, if you haven't
[18:11:48] <OmicroN_> but it does work if your connected to wifi which makes it even more weird
[18:11:57] <erming> lol :p
[18:12:08] <erming> are you loading stuff from an external host? like a cdn
[18:12:19] <OmicroN_> i can't think of anything or any reason something would work on mobile wifi but not mobile 4g
[18:12:28] <OmicroN_> no
[18:13:03] <OmicroN_> not dealing with the calendar
[18:13:38] <OmicroN_> its like the ajax call isn't working
[18:13:59] <OmicroN_> the calendar shows but stuck at loading
[18:14:23] <OmicroN_> don't know if there's any dev tools for mobile where i can see the ajax call and whats going on with it why it works mobile
[18:14:31] <OmicroN_> er works on wifi and not
[18:16:42] <brianhanson> Chrome canary has a bandwidth throttler now
[18:16:58] <brianhanson> or Edge Inspect might work, but not sure how well
[18:17:34] <OmicroN_> i know firefox has remote debugging option but having issue with my phone not wanting to go into usb debugging mode
[18:19:34] <brianhanson> do you have a link?
[18:23:05] <OmicroN_> not really a shareable link
[18:24:32] <brianhanson> bummer
[18:25:00] <OmicroN_> i'd have to isolate on a separate page and what not as its in a secure prod enviroment right now
[18:25:57] <brianhanson> makes sense, could it be a hardware issue? have you tried other mobile devices?
[18:26:21] <OmicroN_> yeah its multiple mobile devices
[18:26:30] <OmicroN_> not sure yet if its all
[18:26:38] <OmicroN_> might just be at&t specific
[18:30:18] <OmicroN_> let me see if i can't make an isolate page and replicate it
[18:30:46] <BillCriswell> At a boy.
[18:34:47] <timh> i'm having trouble with jqueryui. i'm trying to make an image resizable and draggable. i've added a container div around the image, made it inline-block, and made the div draggable with the image resizable. this method is not working :|
[18:35:26] <timh> it's been difficult to duplicate the code in a jsfiddle, but this comes close.. at least, it uses the same images. the image is not resizable http://jsfiddle.net/kb0s5pnx/
[18:41:21] <OmicroN_> alright i created an isolated link and same problem
[18:41:54] <OmicroN_> http://crew.bigyellowservices.com/test.php
[18:42:30] <OmicroN_> so works in browser, works on phone with wifi on but doesn't work on phone with wifi off on 4glte
[18:43:30] <OmicroN_> on at&t, don't know about other networks
[18:43:48] <OmicroN_> brianhanson
[18:47:28] <OmicroN_> or anyone else, don't know if you can test on mobile without wifi see what happens and with wifi
[18:49:47] <timh> OmicroN_, working for me
[18:49:56] <OmicroN_> on mobile with wifi off?
[18:50:15] <timh> yup
[18:50:22] <OmicroN_> what network you have
[18:50:32] <timh> at&t lol
[18:50:40] <OmicroN_> weird
[18:51:07] <timh> agreed
[18:51:07] <OmicroN_> i just get a blank calendar ;/
[18:51:08] <timh> https://www.dropbox.com/s/0qyxlpbl2lyx4zb/Screenshot_2014-08-19-21-49-57.png
[18:51:42] <drej> thats basically not usable
[18:51:54] * drej likes to jump in without context
[18:51:55] <timh> it was blank for me at first, but then it loaded
[18:52:02] <timh> what version of android are you running?
[18:52:21] <OmicroN_> kit kat
[18:52:30] <OmicroN_> 4.4.2
[18:52:37] <timh> gotcha. i'm on 4.4.4
[18:52:41] <OmicroN_> note 3
[18:52:41] <timh> not sure if that would make a difference
[18:52:49] <timh> nexus 5 for me
[18:53:09] <OmicroN_> not sure what the other 2 people who are on att with problems are running
[18:53:49] <OmicroN_> like the weirdest thing ever
[18:54:26] <timh> truth
[18:55:01] <OmicroN_> maybe its a florida att thing :p
[18:55:08] <timh> lol
[18:55:17] <timh> could be ;]
[18:55:29] <ngharo> works for me on android via att lte
[18:55:43] <timh> ngharo, what version of android?
[18:56:06] <ngharo> 4.4.4
[18:56:41] <timh> OmicroN_, have any other android devices laying around?
[18:56:45] <ngharo> OmicroN_: you are throwing a console error
[18:57:02] <OmicroN_> my wifes
[18:57:09] <ngharo> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null
[18:57:33] <OmicroN_> yeah just quickly threw it together, wouldn't thing that'd make any diff
[18:58:52] <OmicroN_> does the same on my wifes note 3 on 4.4.2
[18:59:02] <Zak> jquery documentation is way too verbose
[18:59:09] <Zak> http://api.jquery.com/insertbefore/
[18:59:18] <Zak> "The .before() and .insertBefore() methods perform the same task. The major difference ... "
[18:59:56] <Zak> there's so much fucking shit that describes what things could be, that by the time you read the actual bit that talks about the behaviour, it's so far from the reference function
[19:00:02] <OmicroN_> console error fixed btw :p
[19:00:55] <OmicroN_> still doesn't fix it from not loading on mobile with wifi off
[19:01:55] <ngharo> what browser?
[19:02:31] <OmicroN_> chrome and firefox
[19:02:44] <ngharo> remote debug it
[19:03:00] <OmicroN_> yeah i saw firefox has some remote debug option
[19:03:04] <ngharo> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging
[19:04:14] <OmicroN_> yeah i'll have to try another comp or see why windows doesn't want to detect my phone plugged in
[19:04:27] <OmicroN_> i installed the usb driver..
[19:05:39] <timh> OmicroN_, http://www.ubuntu.com/download ;]
[19:05:40] <timh> lol
[19:11:50] <dmsuperman> Zak: that's because there are many behaviors, not just the one you're looking for
[19:17:18] <OmicroN-tablet> looks like the other 2 devices with the problem are ipads
[19:47:24] <timh> are there any other good plugins, outside of jquery ui's resizable, that are good for resizing images?
[21:07:20] <Zak> dmsuperman: yeah, but it could have been phrased better
[21:07:41] <Zak> we all understand how flexible the jquery api is
[21:07:58] <Zak> but the point of that paragraph was to explain the difference in behaviour between before() and insertBefore()
[21:08:10] <Zak> and adding in all that crap was more confusing
[21:42:41] <Uhkis> "all that crap" ?
[21:44:33] <Zak> yeah, verbose crap which could have been explained later
[21:48:01] <Uhkis> yeah, the problem isn't the documentation ;-)
[21:49:20] <Zak> perhaps
[21:49:40] <Zak> there's problems with jquery, but i think the documentation could have been a bit more helpful
[22:14:10] <jonez> greetings. I'm trying to debug some js which works great in chrome, but is off a bit in ff 31. any tips appreciated. I have a live demo available.
[22:52:21] <con_ssc> I think it might be off in ie as well but somewhere else :)
[22:52:36] <con_ssc> I could take a look at it maybe
[23:10:09] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to make this minimal pure jQuery slider: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/eku4Lwt1/25/ -- can someone tell what I'm missing though?
[23:11:10] <con_ssc> so it should stop at the last one?
[23:11:24] <frank_o> con_ssc: Yep
[23:12:45] <frank_o> some CSS easing like Slick.js uses would be nice
[23:16:32] <Cork> frank_o: side note slideshow not slider
[23:17:08] <frank_o> Cork: yeah :)
[23:18:39] <Cork> frank_o: you can make a slideshow with css only
[23:19:00] <Cork> well you might been a tiny bit for logic (when to do the animation(
[23:19:47] <Cork> frank_o: so is the request to make the same effect without the slick plugin?
[23:20:03] <frank_o> Cork: that would be really cool. ideally yes, same effect
[23:20:48] <frank_o> trying to slide some text over this image. "AFTER SCHOOL PARTY"
[23:20:55] <frank_o> "WITH YOUR HOST FRANK_O" etc.
[23:22:04] <con_ssc> can't help you with that slick thing but maybe you get some inspiration here if you want css only http://codepen.io/search?q=slideshow&limit=all&depth=everything&show_forks=false
[23:23:23] <MrTopless> Hi anyone used http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ before?
[23:23:26] <frank_o> thanks con_ssc. never knew one could use codepen to look for awesome stuff like that
[23:27:50] <trilli> Hello. I'm trying to get the contents of a <script id="MYID"> tag from a page
[23:28:00] <trilli> I I'm using this right now: http://pastebin.com/58Bvqjfg
[23:28:25] <trilli> However, is there a nicer way to get that node's html, instead of having to $.each over the html ?
[23:28:56] <trilli> I tried using $("#id", $(res)) but didn't work.
[23:35:51] <systemfault> $(res).find('#theId') should work
[23:38:21] <trilli> systemfault: If I console.log the result of that it writes: "[prevObject: b.fn.b.init[14], context: undefined, selector: "#gerrit_hostpagedata", jquery: "1.9.1", constructor: function…]  "
[23:38:37] <trilli> And if I execute: $(res).find("#theId").html() it brings me undefined.
[23:38:41] <systemfault> And? What is the length?
[23:38:59] <systemfault> $(res).find("#theId").length is?
[23:39:19] <trilli> 0
[23:39:45] <systemfault> is $(res) what you want?
[23:39:54] <systemfault> Do you get a fragment of HTML?
[23:42:16] <trilli> systemfault: http://pastebin.com/ikWT9Dtp
[23:42:25] <trilli> This is the contents of console.log($(res)), so yeah
[23:42:36] <trilli> There's the 4: script#gerrit_hostpagedata I'm looking for.
[23:42:46] <trilli> I think this is an array that's why find  doesn't work, right?
[23:43:04] <systemfault> trilli:Yeah, you'd need something like .filter('#id')
[23:44:40] <trilli> systemfault: OK, that did it! :D
[23:44:47] <systemfault> Awesome :)
[23:44:47] <trilli> console.log($(res).filter("#gerrit_hostpagedata").html()); works just awesome :D
[23:44:51] <trilli> Thanks a ton!
[23:50:28] <Abid> Hi geeks!
[23:51:20] <Cork> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/c11m5cwy/
[23:51:46] <Cork> frank_o: you prob need to duplicate it for -webkit-
[23:53:09] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/c11m5cwy/1/
[23:56:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/c11m5cwy/2/ removed some unneeded css values
[23:57:09] <timh> sigh
[23:58:07] <timh> so, i have some images which are draggable. if i add code in the HTML to also make them resizable, they don't display at all. if instead, i use the chrome dev console to make them resizable, it works..
[23:58:13] <timh> i don't get it.
