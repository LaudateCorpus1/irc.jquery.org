[00:49:24] <rooted> hello , am trying to add on click an html element to be removed , that has been generated with a number in jquery its seems i cant manage $("name"+var).click any hint ?
[00:54:13] <yuri_> hi, can you send a jsfiddle link, I'm not sure I understand your question
[00:56:14] <rooted> ok , am new in jsfiddle am trying now
[00:58:34] <rooted> yuri_ http://jsfiddle.net/buvzfypw/
[00:59:30] <rooted> i think i cant manage because ive just started jquery before 1hrs
[01:02:28] <yuri_> class names cannot start with number, http://jsfiddle.net/buvzfypw/1/
[01:04:07] <rooted> yuri_ still not working , i think ive updated it :P
[01:05:09] <rooted> yuri_ can you give me a sample of what are you saying ?
[01:07:59] <yuri_> sorry for the delay, I had a call, let me check
[01:08:37] <rooted> ok thanks
[01:08:47] <rooted> ive messede up between classes and ids
[01:08:51] <yuri_> yeah, basically you are using numbers for class names, which will not work
[01:09:04] <yuri_> you can use "a1" but not "1"
[01:09:20] <rooted> so $('.'+var) should be right ?
[01:09:22] <rooted> ouh..
[01:10:32] <rooted> still not working
[01:10:41] <yuri_> no, I've fixed the add department button, you'll have to figure out the rest, check line 13 in html, line 15 in js
[01:10:57] <ragam> hi
[01:12:46] <ragam> I have a question about DataTable. Data table loads all data. I try to implement a search. Is it possible to load data 20 instead of 100 for a specific search criteria?
[01:14:27] <ragam> how can i loan less data in DataTable then the whole data?
[01:17:08] <ragam> how to load data on demand in DataTable?
[01:26:02] <ragam> could anyone help me with data table?
[01:32:49] <Erwat> in a regex example on MDN it has this: var myRe = /d(b+)d/g;
[01:32:50] <rooted> yuri , still not working..
[01:32:55] <Erwat> what's the g after the 2nd /
[01:34:05] <Erwat> oh it's a regex flag
[01:34:21] <Erwat> g is global search, i is case-insensitive search
[01:37:47] <rooted> yuri , ive just noticed that there is no add id , how did it work from that start i dont know... my brain hurts now..
[01:38:11] <yuri_> rooted, ok, let me check further
[01:38:30] <rooted> please do , ive currected every thing and still its not working.
[01:39:40] <rooted> the problem , that after the doc ready , i want a global variable that actually get changed after the loops work.
[01:41:20] <sacho> what's not working?
[01:43:03] <Cork> rooted: you can solve this without having to resort to dynamically added event listeners
[01:44:11] <rooted> Cork using .Next ? i dont know am new @ jquery
[01:45:05] <Cork> one min
[01:45:13] <rooted> ok
[01:45:46] <rooted> i can use the prompt to solve it , but i want it dynamically
[01:46:44] <Cork> rooted: http://jsfiddle.net/buvzfypw/4/
[01:46:49] <yuri_> rooted, is this wahat you need: http://jsfiddle.net/buvzfypw/3/
[01:47:05] <rooted> thanks guys , ill check them all
[01:49:18] <rooted> both works fine , but i have a question , how did the hell it worked for the id add, and i forgot to declare it in html ?
[01:49:38] <rooted> is there a good source to learn about jquery variables ?
[01:50:18] <MaxSlot> Hi guys who are friendly with IE ?
[01:50:36] <MaxSlot> scroll blocking not work
[01:50:49] <MaxSlot> O, FF, CH
[01:50:55] <MaxSlot> all fine but IE :/
[01:50:58] <MaxSlot> http://jsfiddle.net/aukyz8ap/50/
[01:51:26] <MaxSlot> on hover block body scroll and scrolling mini block prevent body from scrolling
[01:53:11] <Cork> rooted: http://jsfiddle.net/buvzfypw/5/
[01:53:21] <Cork> rooted: if(bno) == false
[01:53:27] <Cork> so you fall into the else case
[01:53:42] <Cork> the else case binds $('input.' + 1)
[01:53:53] <Cork> and that handles your append code
[01:54:10] <Cork> classes can be numbers that wasn't the problem
[01:54:16] <rooted> hmm , its good that ive got a headache to realize it.
[01:54:49] <Cork> rooted: but /4 should do the same but without all the code that didn't do anything
[01:55:12] * rooted master in manupilation in DNA :P
[01:55:13] <Cork> as on page load bno will always be undefined
[01:55:29] <rooted> hmm
[01:58:05] <rooted> Cork , i want a way to handle a variable that can be changed under document .ready , and in side the statments any hint ?
[01:58:57] <Cork> rooted: inside what statement?
[01:59:12] <Cork> rooted: start with the cleaned up fiddle in /4
[02:00:05] <rooted> i want a global variable , if iam correct about the type , that i variable can be changed inside if else and document ready , all functions.
[02:03:10] <Cork> rooted: but i don't understand for what you need it
[02:03:21] <Cork> document.ready runs once
[02:03:27] <Cork> not multiple times
[02:04:04] <MaxSlot> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26385756/mouse-scroll-ie-didint-accept-hover-scrolling
[02:04:40] <rooted> Cork , so i can make an array of POST variable to read from php , to create multi-db names
[02:05:03] <Cork> rooted: just do name="thename[]"
[02:05:09] <Cork> php will handle the rest
[02:05:30] <rooted> Cork , that is current
[02:05:38] <rooted> witch i totaly i forgot about it.
[02:05:51] <Cork> what is current??
[02:06:01] <rooted> this is the problem when someone know to many programing langauges.
[02:06:08] <rooted> the html array
[02:06:27] <Cork> there isn't anything called "html array"
[02:06:33] <Cork> param arrays exist though
[02:06:37] <Cork> you might mean that
[02:06:39] <rooted> yep
[02:06:49] <rooted> like extradep
[02:06:56] <Cork> that isn't an array
[02:06:59] <rooted> dep 1 ,2,3,4,5..etc
[02:07:11] <Cork> extradep[] would be
[02:07:36] <rooted> can i kiss you ?
[02:07:43] <Cork> i prefer not
[02:07:57] <rooted> friendly one please ?
[02:08:58] <rooted> yuri_ thanks alot. i understanded your come more though.

[03:22:42] <basiclaser_> hello all, i have inherited a website to work on, and i converted all the images into a png-sprite. However, I am now getting a 404 in the console, originating from this line of jquery-1.10.2 :  l = s ? s.getPropertyValue(n) || s[n] : t, . It says that a bunch of the old images cannot be found. Im not sure how to tackle it!
[03:23:05] <basiclaser_> AFAIK there are no images missing from the page, but my boss wants the 404s cleared up
[03:25:26] <decx> how does an image 404 originate from a line in js?
[03:26:25] <basiclaser_> decx: i know right.. ill share a screenshot though
[03:28:22] <decx> does it set an element background with css() somewhere?
[03:29:03] <basiclaser_> https://www.dropbox.com/s/qfir2e6kfoaxuai/Screenshot%202014-10-17%2012.27.46.png?dl=0
[03:29:23] <basiclaser_> i couldnt say. Its a fairly large website, and the jquery is minified...
[03:29:26] <basiclaser_> decx:
[03:29:30] <decx> so put these images there then
[03:30:11] <decx> it's setting backgrounds with css()
[03:31:05] <basiclaser_> decx: ah ok! may i ask how you worked that out ? im still pretty junior
[03:32:07] <decx> getPropertyValue is only used one time
[03:33:31] <basiclaser_> ah right
[03:33:31] <decx> what i dont know is why dont you just search through your documents for the filenames of the 404ed images
[03:33:35] <decx> makes no sense ^^
[03:34:11] <basiclaser_> decx: i just had, and found the dead paths in my scss ... I was just thrown of by the jquery origin
[03:36:02] <basiclaser_> decx: thanks alot for your help!
[03:36:22] <decx> ok i will thank this alot person
[03:36:38] <decx> /msg alot thanks
[03:40:33] <basiclaser_> le lel
[03:40:38] <basiclaser_> mr.thanks
[04:01:24] <Kartagis> is there a factoid bot here? can we add factoids? or can I bring my bot here?
[04:10:40] <Uhkis> b-ot is enough
[04:33:09] <frank_o> Hi! How come I can't match like `if(!$.hasTextBefore(text))` with `$.hasTextBefore = function(text) { return text.match(regexBefore)[1]; }`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/7/
[04:35:25] <decx> why are you overloading $ anyway?
[04:36:30] <frank_o> decx: Good point I'll take those away
[04:37:27] <decx> and why dont you make an example with an actual youtube embed?
[04:37:33] <ThePeach> lo all, I'm having a problem with a form that is submitted twice. I'm using $('#form').ajax(...);
[04:38:15] <decx> der is no $.fn.ajax
[04:38:19] <decx> there*
[04:38:26] <decx> only $.ajax
[04:38:39] <ThePeach> sorry, my bad. I'm using $.ajax indeed
[04:39:08] <ThePeach> I'm doing $('#form').submit(function () { $.ajax(...) }
[04:39:17] <ThePeach> I compressed a bit too much :P
[04:39:37] <decx> .on('submit',function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $.ajax.... })
[04:40:00] <ThePeach> ok, I'll change using ".on" give me a sec
[04:40:24] <decx> preventDefault is the important part
[04:41:08] <ThePeach> decx: already had it
[04:41:14] <ThePeach> still doing it
[04:41:24] <decx> function(e)?
[04:41:29] <ThePeach> the call is done right and it returns the data works fine
[04:41:30] <ThePeach> yep
[04:41:41] <decx> well then reproduce on a fiddle
[04:41:48] <ThePeach> function (e) { e.preventDefault(); $.ajax(...); }
[04:41:51] <ThePeach> kk
[04:44:39] <frank_o> decx: lo and behold: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/8/ :)
[04:45:03] <ThePeach> decx: woulnd't be there a way to find who's triggering the second event in any way? the form manipulation is a bit a pain in the arse to reproduce in a jsfiddle
[04:45:22] <decx> that's not an embed, that's a spacestation
[04:45:50] <decx> ThePeach put console.log(this,e) everywhere
[04:45:59] <decx> EVERYWHERE
[04:46:00] <decx> ^^
[04:46:21] <Jattenalle> alert(e); !
[04:46:26] <Jattenalle> caveman debugging!
[04:46:27] <decx> blimey
[04:46:54] <ThePeach> ok let's see
[04:52:33] <frank_o> decx: yeah its embedly :)
[04:52:46] <frank_o> minor update: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/9/
[04:52:53] <ThePeach> decx: the events are exactly the same in the two consecutive calls to the submit function
[04:53:15] <frank_o> *uguntu* lol
[04:53:47] <frank_o> ugggghuntu
[04:53:58] <frank_o> you know what they say. Choose OpenBSD for your Unix needs. OpenBSD -- the world's simplest and most secure Unix-like OS. Creator of the world's most used SSH implementation OpenSSH, the world's most elegant firewall PF, and the world's most elegant mail server OpenSMTPD. OpenBSD -- the cleanest kernel, the cleanest userland and the cleanest configuration syntax.
[04:54:33] <frank_o> * and the OpenSSL rewrite LibreSSL
[04:55:25] <decx> so you want to move around your markup and then your markup gets blasted again by embedly? do you hate your visitors that much?
[04:55:40] <Cork> lol
[04:58:59] <decx> for some reason this screams "cleanup of messy wordpress posts" to me
[04:59:15] <decx> just create an extra field for youtube ids in your backend bro
[05:06:11] <frank_o> decx: hey sorry was away for a sec
[05:07:22] <frank_o> well, no this is for after embedly has processed. it is incase some users are too lazy to put their youtube urls on new lines.
[05:07:58] <MaxSlot> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26385756/mouse-scroll-ie-didint-prevent-hover-scrolling
[05:07:59] <decx> that's why you dont rely on users making the right decision
[05:08:11] <decx> extra field for ids, bam solved
[05:10:47] <frank_o> decx: thats a good idea -- but after thinking long and hard im afraid its not that simple =/
[05:11:08] <frank_o> i gotta push on through with this
[05:14:38] <decx> don't
[05:17:04] <frank_o> decx: im trying to avoid extra stuff in my forms UI. plus a lot of these posts are actually scraped so i have no way of controlling them
[05:20:04] <decx> either way clean it up on the backend
[05:20:26] <decx> i'm going to the imbiss to get some food
[05:21:01] <frank_o> ill look into it, thanks. have a great meal decx
[05:52:58] <NeedSomeHelp> hello how do I change the date format for the datepicker? http://jsfiddle.net/p1rkeafw/1/
[06:05:41] <decx> why are there 2 datepicker functions and what is format NeedSomeHelp?
[06:06:58] <NeedSomeHelp> I want yyyy-mm-dd format
[06:07:29] <NeedSomeHelp> I copied from jquery ui website and edited
[06:07:49] <decx> yeah but what is #format?
[06:08:32] <decx> based on that i would think it's something like http://jsfiddle.net/p1rkeafw/2/
[06:08:56] <jphase> NeedSomeHelp: if you just need the yyyy-mm-dd format, I wrote a blog post on this with a quick method:  http://robido.com/javascript/add-ymd-format-method-to-javascript-date-object/
[06:09:30] <jphase> granted, I just came into this channel so might not have what you're trying to do in context :\
[06:09:37] <decx> there is non
[06:09:45] <jphase> heh
[06:09:58] <jphase> mornin'/(insert timezone greeting)  decx
[06:10:18] <decx> 15:09
[06:12:40] <NeedSomeHelp> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/p1rkeafw/4/
[06:13:00] <NeedSomeHelp> decx: the #format shouldnt be there, mistake copying it from the origi doc
[06:13:02] <decx> check your console
[06:13:29] <jphase> yeah you need an object to pass to that method to configure
[06:13:42] <decx> $( "#datepicker" ).datepicker({"dateFormat": "yy-mm-dd"});
[06:14:06] <decx> option is for changing afterwards like i did in my example with #format
[06:14:09] <Mark___> jQuery('window').scroll();
[06:14:15] <Mark___> where can i find examples of jQuery('window').scroll();
[06:14:24] <jphase> NeedSomeHelp: more like something like this perhaps?  http://jsfiddle.net/p1rkeafw/5/
[06:14:46] <Blinky_> Guys, could someone please have a look at this script and tell me why it does not work.  From what I can tell the variable 'recallGet' is not being passed to the recall.php file or the php is not accepting it, not sure - http://pastebin.com/Wqtf6xGv
[06:14:49] <jphase> Mark___: that's just the scroll event, what are you trying to do?
[06:15:19] <decx> scrape the quotes
[06:15:26] <Mark___> im trying to mimic the navigation bar of this website : http://www.abercrombie.com/shop/wd/mens-new-arrivals
[06:15:26] <decx> window is already in window ^^
[06:15:40] <NeedSomeHelp> Thank you both!
[06:16:00] <decx> Mark___ that pattern is called sticky nav
[06:22:59] <Mark___> how do i make it appear from the top though? it’s not a layer that existed in the first time.
[06:23:19] <Mark___> it appears from the top when i scroll it down.
[06:32:35] <decx> here's a simple example Mark___ http://jsfiddle.net/gocsyebt/
[06:34:09] <decx> man now all i can think of is the room
[06:34:17] <sweet2k4> i have a little problem. an img tag is wrapped in a p tag and the img does not scale with the browser window unless i give it a width.100%; but then images that are smaler then the <p> width are scaled up. So i was thinking about extracting the the img size and put it as a max-width for each img element (could be multiple within the p tag) here is code to explain: http://jsfiddle.net/w3u2bgy7/7/
[06:34:31] <decx> i did not hit her i did not hit her i did not - oh hi mark
[06:34:42] <Mark___> whatever that means
[06:34:54] <decx> it's a ridiculous movie
[06:35:06] <Mark___> thx for the code, but it is still difficult for me to follow.
[06:35:41] <Mark___> the layer shouldn’t be visible before scrolling down.
[06:35:45] <decx> we get the element, we get the elements offset to the top and its height, on window scroll we use that information to add or remove the class sticky based on the scrollposition of the window
[06:35:56] <Mark___> lol...
[07:03:43] <Blinky_> Guys I am trying to use this to pull just te ID tag from the option on an html form - $('select[name=recall]').on('change', function() {var recallGet = $(this).val() - However, it is pulling all the content of the option.  How do I get it to pull just the id from the option tag?
[07:06:05] <fatmandown> hey guys, I have several buttons with the same class but different id's, when a button is clicked I'm trying to get the value of the ID. It keeps coming back as undefined- any ideas?
[07:06:50] <fatmandown> the syntax is simple, just $(".mybuttonclass").click( get id stuff here )
[07:07:04] <mbrzuzy> $(this).attr('id')
[07:07:21] <mbrzuzy> $('.class').on('click', function() { $(this).attr('id') });
[07:07:33] <decx> this[this.selectedIndex].id
[07:07:35] <fatmandown> that's exactly what I have
[07:07:43] <fatmandown> wait
[07:07:44] <decx> Blinky_ ^^
[07:07:46] <fatmandown> no, I'm using the click selector
[07:07:52] <mbrzuzy> click should work too
[07:07:58] <fatmandown> yeah, it doesn't, keeps coming back as undefined
[07:08:02] <decx> that's just this.id btw guys
[07:08:10] <decx> no need to extra wrap
[07:08:17] <mbrzuzy> try to do a console.log($(this)) and see what it spits out after a click
[07:08:29] * kevin waves
[07:09:21] <mdev> is there a clean way to monitor all textbox changes
[07:09:32] <mdev> short of individual, keypress, change etc...events?
[07:10:05] <decx> input
[07:10:56] <mdev> awesome thank you
[07:15:43] <fatmandown> mbrzuzy: thank you, just found out what was wrong
[07:15:47] <fatmandown> I'm an idiot was the problem haha
[07:16:24] <mbrzuzy> aha, np :)
[07:16:47] <fatmandown> cheers, guys. I'm sure I'll be back in here soon enough
[07:41:40] <davetarmac> hey guys - got an issue with equal height columns and show/hide functions: http://jsfiddle.net/spacebeers/s8uLG/3/
[07:43:34] <mdev> found awesome way to detect input
[07:43:36] <mdev> changes
[07:43:49] <mdev> $("input").blur(function_to_call);
[07:44:02] <mdev> that's for all input but can specify specific too
[07:44:08] <decx> onblur is older than the internet
[07:45:52] <Omar-> lol decx
[07:46:08] <Omar-> mdev onfocusout is good too
[07:46:22] <decx> i never had problems with change
[07:49:08] <ph88> hi guys
[08:01:12] <davetarmac> Anyone know how to set a dynamic height for this scenario? I need both columns to stay "in sync" http://jsfiddle.net/spacebeers/s8uLG/3/
[08:07:06] <dapseen> hello, can some one  please help me, the jquery script is loading in the source file of  http://www.gosgol.com but its not performing anything
[08:08:02] <dapseen> anyone here?
[08:10:41] <decx> i always thought the opposite of a mentor was a manatee
[08:11:43] <respek> zing
[08:12:03] <dapseen> decx: no
[08:12:19] <dapseen> decx: have you checked the page source?
[08:12:38] <decx> it's drupal i'd rather not
[08:13:12] <dapseen> decx: its drupal
[08:13:26] <fatmandown> i'm back D:
[08:13:58] <fatmandown> Does the Addclass function allow for callback functions? I'm adding a class that animates an element with CSS, and when the CSS animation is done I want to remove the element
[08:14:04] <fatmandown> but it doesn't seem to be working out for me
[08:14:06] <decx> dapseen the object is called jQuery not jquery
[08:14:20] <decx> it's case sensitive
[08:16:09] <decx> that is for front.js, for the inline script you have to wrap it in a iife because drupal is strange
[08:16:19] <decx> or use jQuery there too
[08:16:49] <respek> fatmandown: check out the code at, http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/ which adds classes then takes them away
[08:16:54] <decx> ie: (function ($) { $(document).ready(function(){ ... }); })(jQuery);
[08:17:04] <dapseen> decx: thanks man, its working
[08:17:16] <dapseen> decx: yeah got it
[08:17:21] <fatmandown> respek: I want to remove the element from the DOM after the animation is finished, though
[08:17:31] <fatmandown> I'm using animate.css haha
[08:18:17] <decx> there's a callback for transition and animationend that you can use
[08:18:26] <fatmandown> oh wooooooord?
[08:18:30] <decx> on('transitionend',function(){
[08:18:33] <fatmandown> does it apply to CSS animations?
[08:18:40] <decx> animationend for animations
[08:19:08] <respek> !api animationend
[08:19:08] <b-ot> respek: No matches.
[08:19:10] <decx> on('animationend webkitAnimationEnd MSAnimationEnd oAnimationEnd' for crossbrowser
[08:19:11] <bl4ckdu5t> Can I still be in control of the dom from an event even after doing a window.location.replace() ?
[08:19:17] <respek> !api .animationend

[08:23:10] <mattjs5> hi everyone
[08:23:46] <mattjs5> whats the best way to filter a <select> box as you type into an <input type="text">?
[08:23:56] <mattjs5> ive tried using many solutions including http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/23706/better-way-to-filter-select-list
[08:24:07] <mattjs5> and they work but are extremely slow
[08:24:17] <mattjs5> i have about 10k items in the select

[08:33:24] <edrahn> How would I select  a value from a dropdown?
[08:33:39] <respek> ooh nice little plugin :)
[08:33:40] <edrahn> using .val(values) doesn't work
[08:33:56] <edrahn> I can get it to work on the names, but not the values...
[08:34:11] <decx> this.value on a select is value of the selected option
[08:34:15] <decx> the value*

[08:44:43] <seaders> hey guys, trying to get a custom header to be in a collapsible, but having some issues with it
[08:45:13] <seaders> the main outcome I'd like is to have it styleable like a normal header
[08:45:22] <seaders> with left, and right icons, if I put them in
[08:45:46] <seaders> but function like a normal collapsible header if you don't click the icons
[08:46:19] <seaders> anybody with much experience doing the like?
[08:47:32] <b-lew> is there a tutorial around to animate a banner div from off screen? that is set with a cookie? if they have clicked the banner don't show it again?
[09:02:30] <sweet2k4> if ((int)(ini_get('post_max_size')) < $MaxSizeUpload) were is the post_max_size stored?
[09:02:45] <sweet2k4> som kind of ini file in the browser?
[09:03:05] <sweet2k4> or is it on the server?
[09:03:22] <MarkyC> if I use event delegation ($('#foo').on('change', '[name$="[color]"]', validateColor($(this))), how can I pass the [color] field to validateColor? $(this) in that context appears to be a Window object
[09:03:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you bind like that.
[09:05:09] <MarkyC> Here's the thing, those color fields are generated dynamically (a user can add a new color field, for example). I was using event delegation to catch the new fields (because $('name$=[color]').change() would only run on the fields that were alive when the page was loaded)
[09:05:31] <robertmaxrees> $('#foo').on('change', '[name$="[color]"]', validateColor); is how you do it that way
[09:05:43] <decx> and this is this either way
[09:05:58] <robertmaxrees> drop the $(this) from the binding, otherwise you're running things in really strange way.
[09:06:10] <robertmaxrees> and you can use .call() and .bind() to pass extra params if you want
[09:06:36] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that can take a look at this in firefox to see what it is doing and maybe shed light on why it doesn't work in safari, please? http://purenaples.com/phone/purephone3.html
[09:07:09] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: can you give an example of using call() or bind()?
[09:08:56] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: I see that the handler has the signature handler(EventObject, Anything). How can I pass that specific field that was changed (I'm assuming I use call or bind here)?
[09:09:16] <robertmaxrees> showing you that now.
[09:09:17] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[09:11:09] <MarkyC> Forbidd3n: what does "doesn't work" mean. Explain the problem.
[09:11:38] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rwfuckt6/
[09:11:43] <Forbidd3n> MarkyC: it switches out the phone number in firefox and doesn't in safari - hence the reason I asked to try it in both
[09:12:14] <robertmaxrees> Forbidd3n can you create a minimal test case of your problem?
[09:12:29] <shoky> MarkyC: just use  $(this) inside your handler function..
[09:12:32] <Forbidd3n> robertmaxrees: there isn't much code there - that is a live page with the code
[09:12:37] <Forbidd3n> not sure what test case you are looking for
[09:12:56] <robertmaxrees> brb free food @ work
[09:13:10] <shoky> MarkyC: same as you would for non-delegated handler
[09:15:12] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: Thank you for the example. (enjoy your lunch, pizza was just dropped off at our office too!)
[09:15:19] <robertmaxrees> breakfast, not lunch ;)
[09:15:25] <robertmaxrees> it IS 9:15 after all.
[09:15:27] <MarkyC> shoky: That works!
[09:15:42] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC oh, you just wanted to use the `this` object?
[09:15:44] * MarkyC is on the east coast (Toronto)
[09:16:39] <MarkyC> shoky: to be honest, I don't know why $(this) in that context referred to the [name$=[color]] object from the selector.
[09:16:51] <robertmaxrees> because that's the element that fired the event.
[09:16:55] <shoky> MarkyC: because .on does that for you
[09:17:02] <robertmaxrees> that's the reason we use delegated listeners.
[09:17:15] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: When I did validate($(this)), the $this was a window object, but when I do this within the validate() method, $this is the [name=[color]] object
[09:17:29] <shoky> that's not INSIDE the handler fuinction
[09:17:35] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC because you were incorrectly binding the handler.
[09:18:19] <shoky> you need to pass a function, not call a function and pass its return value
[09:19:18] <MarkyC> So, in .on('change', '.foo', function($(this))), the $this is a Window, but in on('change', '.foo', function() {  $(this) }), the $this is the .foo. My JS is bad (I'm more of a backend guy)
[09:19:33] <shoky> MarkyC: $().on(.., validate($(this)))  is same as:    var v = validate($(this));  $().on(..., v);
[09:20:09] <MarkyC> shoky: I see.
[09:20:19] <shoky> and outside of the handler, if "this" was not set to anything else, it will be the window object (the global object)
[09:23:20] <MarkyC> Thanks for the explanation shoky robertmaxrees ! I'm headed to pizza lunch

[10:09:57] <hollusion> how can i delegate a plugin?
[10:10:25] <hollusion> im trying to apply .editable() on all .class items
[10:10:35] <hollusion> even those that get created afterwards
[10:10:56] <brian1001> hi
[10:11:01] <brian1001> is someone here familiar with this bug: https://github.com/senchalabs/jQTouch/issues/517
[10:11:03] <robertmaxrees> hollusion that's now how delegation works.
[10:11:09] <robertmaxrees> *not how, rather
[10:11:15] <hollusion> :)
[10:11:41] <hollusion> how can i reach my goal then?
[10:13:04] <robertmaxrees> by initing every time you add those items.
[10:13:16] <robertmaxrees> you can delegate events, not plugin initialization
[10:13:28] <hollusion> i see
[10:15:02] <b-lew> anyone use the jquery cookie plugin? I can't seem to get my if statement to work.
[10:15:12] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ph5L75g4/
[10:15:37] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($.cookie('vsphomebanner')); - what do you get?
[10:16:16] <b-lew> I'll put that in the if ($.cookie('vsphomebanner'))  let me see.
[10:16:21] <b-lew> thanks for your help robertmaxrees
[10:16:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:16:24] <robertmaxrees> before.
[10:16:30] <robertmaxrees> you want to see what the value is.
[10:16:54] <b-lew> I see, it says it's undefined.
[10:16:58] <b-lew> how do I set that?
[10:17:11] <robertmaxrees> do console.log($.cookie) in your code - what does that give you?
[10:17:47] <b-lew> that displays the entire function
[10:17:48] <b-lew> function (key, value, options) {
[10:18:02] <robertmaxrees> then reread the documentation and make sure you're using it correctly.
[10:18:03] <robertmaxrees> :D
[10:18:16] <b-lew> odd. okay.
[10:19:17] <b-lew> I think I'm having an issue understanding what I want in the value.
[10:19:20] <b-lew> $.cookie('name', 'value');
[10:20:12] <b-lew> I've always had a tuff time understand values in jquery for some reason.
[10:20:43] <robertmaxrees> the cookie probably wants a string.
[10:20:47] <robertmaxrees> instead of an object.
[10:21:14] <b-lew> so this wouldn't work? $.cookie('vsphomebanner', 'clicked on banner', { expires: 1 });
[10:21:25] <b-lew> sorry to paste in here. my fault.
[10:21:25] <robertmaxrees> that should work.  one sec.
[10:21:39] <robertmaxrees> not that's fine.  multi-line pastes are a no-bo
[10:21:42] <b-lew> that's why I'm confused I think
[10:21:49] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:23:16] <robertmaxrees> if($.cookie('vsphomebanner') === null) { this is your problem.
[10:23:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ph5L75g4/1/
[10:23:46] <robertmaxrees> it returned undefined, not null.
[10:25:55] <b-lew> huh, that is still going to my else console.log
[10:26:05] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle?
[10:26:13] <robertmaxrees> because it works.
[10:26:17] <b-lew> one sec.
[10:26:26] <b-lew> you want all of the js or just the if else?
[10:26:37] <b-lew> I'll just do the if/else
[10:26:39] <robertmaxrees> just the stuff related to the problem.
[10:27:54] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ph5L75g4/3/
[10:28:18] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: I should probably include yer handle when pasting.
[10:28:22] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[10:28:39] <robertmaxrees> and that most recent fiddle works.
[10:28:55] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ph5L75g4/4/ <- included jquery 2.1 and the plugin for you here.
[10:28:56] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[10:29:05] <b-lew> I'm including http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.js
[10:29:13] <b-lew> maybe the plugin is out of date.
[10:29:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ph5L75g4/5/ works with 1.11
[10:30:47] <b-lew> i was on 1.3.1 of the jquery cookie let me update to 1.4.1 and see if it fixes my issue.
[10:32:49] <b-lew> Thanks robertmaxrees it's working on jsfiddle but not locally. Will see if I can match the 2
[10:33:07] <robertmaxrees> any other errors in your console?
[10:35:32] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: not in my console no... no syntax errors.
[10:35:36] <b-lew> very odd tho
[10:36:17] <robertmaxrees> and you're sure you're hitting this block of code?  if you put a console.log() before that first if statement, you see it, right?
[10:38:24] <b-lew> if i do this the cookie is undefined. console.log($.cookie('vsphomebanner'));
[10:38:32] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/ph5L75g4/7/
[10:39:58] <robertmaxrees> make sure your cache is cleared and try this, too: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ph5L75g4/8/
[10:40:29] <darkfrog> is there any way to create a selector from within an iframe that selects something within the parent window?
[10:41:45] <robertmaxrees> darkfrog http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12477111/select-iframe-parent-from-within-iframe
[10:43:52] <b-lew> robertmaxrees: I think it's my cache... seems to work in another browser.
[10:44:08] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: I was hoping for a single selector that would match instead of having to do something like $(window.parent).find(...)
[10:44:10] <robertmaxrees> if you're in chrome, there's a setting that always clears javascript cache on reload.
[10:44:12] <b-lew> I may leave the room to clear my chrome cache and return.
[10:44:13] <b-lew> brb
[10:44:26] <b-lew> yea? let me see about that
[10:44:30] <robertmaxrees> b-lew you can just do ctrl+f5, too.
[10:44:39] <robertmaxrees> darkfrog there isn't a selector for it...
[10:44:45] <darkfrog> darn
[10:44:50] <darkfrog> okay, thanks anyway
[10:45:00] <robertmaxrees> you have to do $(window.parent)...  why do you need a selector instead?
[10:46:02] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: I was trying to make it more abstract...the function currently just takes a selector, but now it will also need an optional argument for a parent selector
[10:46:43] <robertmaxrees> darkbasic yeah, you can't "Select" a parent object like that, which is the problem.
[10:46:48] <robertmaxrees> also this assumes CORS isn't an issue.
[10:46:54] <brian1001> may i please a question here?
[10:47:01] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ brian1001
[10:47:01] <b-ot> brian1001: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:47:06] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: CORS isn't an issue...I'm controlling both documents
[10:47:12] <robertmaxrees> then you should be fine :)
[10:47:21] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: thanks
[10:47:36] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: hey, don't suppose you're looking for some side contract JavaScript work? :)
[10:47:41] <robertmaxrees> nope haha
[10:47:45] <darkfrog> darn
[10:47:51] <darkfrog> well, thanks again
[10:47:51] <robertmaxrees> too busy with my main gig.  thanks for the offer thougj.
[10:48:09] <Fishy> If im starting a animation on hover is there anyway i can stop it before its done if i no longer hover.
[10:48:26] <robertmaxrees> Fishy sure - check out the .stop() method
[10:49:10] <Fishy> robertmaxrees: very clever
[10:50:00] <Synthead> I have a jQuery object, table, created via $("table").  I want to declare more jQuery objects from children in this object, and .find doesn't seem to work: $(table).find() ... DOMException: Failed to execute 'querySelector' on 'Document': '[object HTMLTableElement]' is not a valid selector. How do I do this?
[10:50:15] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Synthead
[10:50:15] <b-ot> Synthead: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:50:46] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: it's two lines: var table = $("table"); $(table).find();
[10:51:00] <robertmaxrees> Synthead that doesn't make any sense then.
[10:51:15] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: how so?  should this work?
[10:51:17] <robertmaxrees> table is already a jquery object - no need to pass it to $() again
[10:51:21] <Fishy> robertmaxrees: $(this).dequeue().stop(); seems to work perfectly
[10:51:46] <robertmaxrees> Synthead and you're not making anything, you're selecting all tables on the page.
[10:52:09] <robertmaxrees> also - if you're running from the console, make sure jquery is actyually available.  some browsers shortcut $ to document.querySelectorAll()
[10:52:16] <MeXTuX> I have many elements with the same class. I only want to select the first one using the class name. Is that possible?
[10:52:24] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX yep - .eq(0)
[10:52:42] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: table.find() results in TypeError: undefined is not a function
[10:52:57] <MeXTuX> robertmaxrees tnx  :)
[10:53:25] <robertmaxrees> Synthead are you running this in the conosle?
[10:53:31] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: yes
[10:53:38] <robertmaxrees> try $.fn.jquery - what do you get?
[10:54:00] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined ... hrm
[10:54:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't loaded.
[10:54:13] <robertmaxrees> now try jQuery.fn.jquery - case is important here.
[10:54:38] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: yeah.  okay, heh.  I'm building a chrome extension, so I imagine it's semantics related to that.  I'll take it from here :) thanks!
[10:54:58] <robertmaxrees> Synthead jquery isn't loaded by default btw.  you have to manually bring it in.  that'll do it though.
[10:55:32] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: yeah, it's loaded in my manifest.json, but I didn't realize that it wouldn't be available in the console after
[10:55:38] <dmsuperman> I was never able to get jquery in chrome extensions to work nicely without just pasting the contents of jquery.min.js into my extension
[10:55:44] <dmsuperman> ah yes also that
[10:55:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah sandboxed.
[10:55:58] <Synthead> dmsuperman: yeah, it works if I put it in content_scripts
[10:56:23] <dmsuperman> oh I was just talking about userscripts, nevermind me entirely :P
[10:56:31] <dmsuperman> I haven't written any extensions
[10:57:51] <Synthead> can I use xpaths on jquery objects?
[10:58:12] <dmsuperman> I doubt it, but why? to accomplish what?
[10:58:23] <dmsuperman> they're generally just flat lists
[10:58:51] <Synthead> dmsuperman: I want to find an <a> in a <th> that has a certain text value
[10:59:02] <robertmaxrees> Synthead there's a .contains()
[10:59:35] <dmsuperman> would that be faster/slower than $('th a:contains()') ?
[10:59:36] <dmsuperman> or just an alias
[10:59:55] <robertmaxrees> those methods are generally faster than the selector-style ones.
[11:00:01] <dmsuperman> interesting
[11:00:17] <robertmaxrees> even in cases like $('#parent .child'); vs $('#parent').find('child'); - the second one performs better.
[11:00:29] <b-lew> it's odd robertmaxrees cleared my cache and it works in ff but not in chrome.
[11:00:29] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/ for some good info.
[11:00:43] <dmsuperman> thanks for the link
[11:00:47] <robertmaxrees> b-lew chrome is pretty sticky with their cache.  dunno what to tell you.
[11:01:10] <b-lew> no worries. I'll keep at it. Thanks so much man!
[11:01:28] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[11:04:44] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: how can I select the <a> with text "bar" using the table var from this? http://jsfiddle.net/tLyok1mn/1/
[11:09:39] <robertmaxrees> Synthead did you look at the .contains() method?
[11:10:10] <robertmaxrees> woops selector i guess.
[11:10:53] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tLyok1mn/2/
[11:11:17] <robertmaxrees> the method doesn't support finding elements with text.  weird.
[11:11:45] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: I don't want a boolean value if it contains or or not, I want a DOM of the <a> object :)
[11:11:53] <robertmaxrees> that's what myElement is.
[11:15:01] <Synthead> robertmaxrees: oh, there we go!  okay, how about if it only explicitly contains "bar" (/^bar$/) and not "foobar"?
[11:16:46] <robertmaxrees> then you need to use .filter() instead.
[11:16:51] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22929862/jquery-containsregex
[11:31:03] <darkfrog> is it not correct to do: $(window.parent).find('#myParentElementId') ?
[11:33:35] <kevireilly> darkfrog: perhaps $('#myParentElementId', window.parent)
[11:34:37] <kevireilly> darkfrog: actually, second parameter needs to be a dom
[11:35:08] <robertmaxrees> kevin that's almost identical to what he posted ;)
[11:35:14] <robertmaxrees> that uses .find() under the hood
[11:35:33] <darkfrog> well, both of them return 0 elements
[11:35:46] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out they're the same.
[11:36:04] <darkfrog> robertmaxrees: now point out the correct answer. ;)
[11:36:10] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: ah, i didn't know that ;)
[11:36:36] <robertmaxrees> try $(parent.document).find('#myParentElementId')

[12:03:36] <Alina-malina> is it ok to put 2 jquery POST resquest inside $(document).ready function? like jQuery.ajax();   and another jQuery.ajax() immidetly after it?
[12:04:47] <Alina-malina> or perhaps make 1 big request? :-/
[12:05:00] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do?
[12:05:39] <Alina-malina> robertmaxrees, retrieve json data from server 2 differnt type of requests
[12:05:53] <robertmaxrees> does one rely on the other finishing?
[12:05:55] <Alina-malina> but they both need to be showed on the main page
[12:06:09] <Alina-malina> hmmm, well it would be nice if it was some order
[12:06:22] <robertmaxrees> then you do the second one in the done() callback of the first.
[12:06:23] <Alina-malina> would look very feautiful
[12:06:31] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done($.ajax())
[12:06:35] <Alina-malina> oh
[12:06:38] <Alina-malina> super
[12:06:48] <Alina-malina> let me try it thanks alot! very beutiful!
[12:06:51] <MarkyC> Is there a way to select all .foo ($('.foo')), but not .foo's with a parent #bar?
[12:07:07] <robertmaxrees> MarkyC there's .not()
[12:07:09] <robertmaxrees> also .filter()
[12:10:42] <MarkyC> robertmaxrees: Something like: var $foosNotInBar = $('.foo').not(function() { return $(this).parent('#bar').length; });
[12:11:11] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[12:11:19] <robertmaxrees> the docs have a decent example.
[12:12:56] <brian1001> does someone knows why the menu is broken in chrome (on this page) http://jqtjs.com/preview/demos/main/#ui , i swear that it worked in my older version of chrome
[12:13:15] <robertmaxrees> what menu?
[12:13:30] <robertmaxrees> also: it sounds like you need to contact the plugin developer.
[12:14:12] <brian1001> please click menu on that page
[12:14:14] <brian1001> it opens the menu
[12:14:16] <brian1001> but then the page hangs
[12:14:25] <robertmaxrees> dunno mano.
[12:14:32] <robertmaxrees> reach out to the plugin dev.
[12:15:27] <brian1001> thank you for your help :)
[12:23:51] <doug_> brian1001: http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fjqtjs.com%2Fpreview%2Fdemos%2Fmain%2F%23home&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0
[12:24:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:28:31] <fartface> Could anyone tell me why my "hover" events aren't firing when using "on"?  http://jsfiddle.net/hsga9owo/  They work when using .hover(), but I would think that using .on() would have better performance?
[12:29:06] <doug_> brian1001: resist the urge to equate "worked before" with "was correct before". invalid html is handled differently by different browsers
[12:30:44] <doug_> fartface: hover takes two callbacks: over and out callbacks
[12:30:48] <doug_> iirc
[12:31:41] <doug_> fartface: to simulate hover you need to use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave'
[12:32:00] <fartface> doug_: Ah!  Good to know.  I've used it with click in the past without issue, but that makes sense.
[12:32:01] <fartface> One sec.
[12:32:15] <doug_> $(foo).hover(bar, baz)  -->  $(foo).on('mouseover', bar).on('mouseout', baz)
[12:32:28] <doug_> fartface: ^
[12:33:13] <fartface> Putting a second callback didn't seem to help.
[12:33:56] <fartface> doug_: But changing hover to mouseover did work, so clearly there's something to this.  I probably just implemented it incorrectly.
[12:34:00] <fartface> Thanks!
[12:37:14] <doug_> fartface: http://jsfiddle.net/u1kasmtr/1/
[12:37:19] <doug_> np
[12:37:58] <brian1001> thank you doug_
[12:38:54] <doug_> np
[12:40:12] <fartface> doug_: Cheers!  I understand the syntax--there just seemed to be an issue with implementing it using "on" rather than .hover().  StackOverflow answers seem to indicate a preference for using 'on', and then attaching an object with mouseover and mouseleave rather than using 'hover' at all.
[12:41:22] <doug_> fartface: yes, same with .click, .change, etc. if you look at the jquery source you'll see that they are stubs that call on anyway. besides, if you call a function .click, shouldn't it click something? I find the shorthand names misleading
[12:44:21] <MarkyC> fartface: There is a benefit to using $.on('click') over $.click(). See here: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[12:44:36] <fartface> doug_: ended up changing it to this, just to illustrate your point http://jsfiddle.net/hsga9owo/1/
[12:44:55] <doug_> fartface: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.hover
[12:45:10] <doug_> hover -> mouseenter -> on     so why not call on yourself
[12:45:20] <doug_> that's why they suggest using on on SO
[12:45:33] <fartface> MarkyC: Yes I know, that's why I wanted to use on, the content is dynamic, and I knew I needed to use delegation, but it wasn't firing on 'hover' event, because 'hover' isn't an actual event.
[12:45:55] <fartface> It's two events.  My mistake!
[12:46:03] <MarkyC> fartface: gotcha
[12:46:38] <fartface> http://i.imgur.com/pH052.gif
[12:46:53] <doug_> fartface: nice
[12:47:47] <fartface> I've worked with event delegation a bunch before.  It's really strange to me that I've never run into needing it for a mouseover event like that.
[12:48:03] <fartface> That's why I couldn't understand why it wasn't working haha.  smh rookie mistake!
[12:48:10] <doug_> your mistake is probably common, most of the other names are actually event names
[12:48:48] <doug_> click, change, etc
[12:49:08] <fartface> Exactly
[12:49:08] <frank_o> Hi! Trying to separate paragraphs that contain YouTube links, but how come currently `extractedText` is empty and new paragraphs are not being created? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/we1qenh0/18/
[12:51:41] <doug_> frank_o: to exclude children: $(this).clone().children().remove().end().text()
[12:52:08] <doug_> frank_o: iirc
[12:52:32] <frank_o> Hi there Doug
[12:53:04] <doug_> hi
[12:53:07] <frank_o> doug_: Spot on :-)
[12:53:20] <frank_o> your memory serves you well.
[12:53:27] <doug_> :)
[12:53:57] <frank_o> doug_: the problem however seems to be with `if(!hasTextBefore(text) && hasTextAfter(text)) {` -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/18/
[12:54:39] <doug_> frank_o: those regex '*' modifiers are greedy
[12:54:49] <doug_> shouldn't they be *?  (ungreedy)
[12:55:57] <doug_> I mean star-questionmark: *?
[12:56:23] <doug_> (.*) will "go crazy" and consume the rest of the input won't it?
[12:56:41] <frank_o> doug_: I'm not sure. That part seems to work fine though: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/fqwow5rr/1/
[12:59:47] <doug_> frank_o: line 53 test looks backward
[13:00:02] <doug_> if not has text before use the before regex??
[13:00:39] <frank_o> doug_: Oh indeedie-o what was i thinking :S
[13:01:52] <frank_o> doug_: But still shouldn't everything inside that block execute? The first div in the HTML should match those criteria
[13:03:08] <doug_> frank_o: will the paragraphs before and after the youtube be siblings (have the same parent)
[13:04:49] <frank_o> doug_: Yep
[13:04:50] <doug_> I hate the firefox debugger.  no obvious way to switch context to a frame. switching to chrome :(
[13:05:10] <frank_o> why dont you use chrome by default?
[13:05:25] <doug_> frank_o: because it's a power consuming pig (on a laptop)
[13:05:38] <doug_> it never stops banging on the disk
[13:06:36] <frank_o> wasnt aware of that :)
[13:06:54] <doug_> chrome has a debilitating case of OCD - it is obsessed with updating the history and cookies, even when idle
[13:08:07] <doug_> on my desktop, I actually have a hard link redirecting the chrome write-spam directory onto a magnetic drive
[13:08:20] <doug_> so it doesn't spam write my ssd unnecessarily
[13:08:34] <Alina-malina> erm, how to do addition inside append()?
[13:08:55] <Alina-malina> it interpret addition as string :-/
[13:09:33] <doug_> Alina-malina: convert them to numbers, using parseFloat or parseInt or Number(n) or +n
[13:09:36] <frank_o> lol are you serious??
[13:09:50] <doug_> frank_o: me? yes
[13:10:27] <Alina-malina> doug_, alright thanks, it works
[13:10:38] <frank_o> thats awful :/
[13:10:48] <ccmonster> if i have an obj, can i pass it to set multiple data attr at once? myobj = {name:joe,age:21} item.data(myobj)??
[13:10:49] <Alina-malina> frank_o, whats awful?
[13:11:11] <frank_o> Alina-malina: chrome acting all crazy and stuff
[13:11:35] <Alina-malina> what you mean?
[13:11:45] <Alina-malina> how is that related to this -> parseInt ?
[13:12:03] <frank_o> Alina-malina: i was talking to doug_. http://cheezburger.com/8348948736 :P
[13:13:20] <doug_> js> "100" + 10
[13:13:23] <b-ot> doug_: No output.
[13:13:29] <doug_> js> print("100" + 10)
[13:13:32] <b-ot> doug_: 10010
[13:13:43] <doug_> js> print(parseInt("100",10) + 10)
[13:13:46] <b-ot> doug_: 110
[13:13:51] <decx> +"100" is cooler
[13:14:02] <doug_> decx: doesn't always work
[13:14:07] <badams> remeber the base
[13:14:27] <doug_> >> print(parseInt("400+"), +"400+") @ decx
[13:15:18] <doug_> b-ot: hello? :D
[13:15:37] * doug_ whacks b-ot upside the head
[13:15:49] <decx> sure but that's a bit esoteric isnt it
[13:15:52] <doug_> >> print(parseInt("400+", 10), +"400+")
[13:16:15] <doug_> since I discovered that the '+' trick isn't always correct, I lean toward parseInt now
[13:16:28] <doug_> but + is valid when you "know" it is a valid number
[13:17:02] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/17KFXN5
[13:17:21] <Paradisee> how can i dinamically do it?
[13:17:24] <Paradisee> just read the comments
[13:17:32] <Paradisee> 25/27
[13:18:53] <doug_> Paradisee: image.attr('src', someImageUrl)
[13:19:26] <Paradisee> doug_: i'll try
[13:21:39] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/3CNHM42
[13:21:48] <Paradisee> it will change the values in the json
[13:22:01] <Paradisee> now when i got a differente state it has to change the image
[13:23:51] <doug_> Paradisee: load_json needs to set the image from that json response?
[13:24:36] <Paradisee> doug_: each time i click on the object, is has to set its value to 1 or 0, so it should be read from the json before
[13:24:45] <Paradisee> and change the image displayed
[13:25:39] <doug_> it can "know" both images up front then have some simple logic for toggling the image?
[13:25:59] <doug_> or is that an oversimplification of the real scenario?
[13:27:18] <Paradisee> doug_: what do you mean?
[13:31:37] <doug_> Paradisee: I mean, do you know both image urls up front before doing that load_json
[13:31:53] <Paradisee> doug_: i could
[13:32:29] <doug_> then a very simple implementation could store the other url and a flag in data attributes right in the image element, then very simple event handlers could toggle them on click
[13:32:48] <Paradisee> could you provide an example?
[13:38:01] <doug_> Paradisee: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.hover
[13:38:02] <doug_> oops
[13:38:09] <doug_> http://dpaste.com/1KJT46S/duplicate/
[13:38:12] <doug_> Paradisee: ^
[13:38:24] <Paradisee> ill give a look thanks
[13:42:53] <matthewk> i have a collection of elements in a jquery object array. i'd like to create a comma delimited string with id of each of those elements. is there a function to do this?
[13:43:35] <matthewk> i could do it by using a .each over the collection, but i wanted to learn of a function to do it if there's one already in the library
[13:44:12] <doug_> $.map(myArray, function() { return $(this).attr(id); })
[13:44:56] <doug_> $.map(myArray, function() { return $(this).attr(id); }).slice().join(', ')      I think
[13:45:29] <doug_> oops, 'id' ,   not id
[13:48:08] <rn10950> I am creating a local HTML app on MSIE 6 (2k, XP and 2k3) that will be running off of a folder in %appdata% and I would like to know if it is possble to save the current DOM to the writable file in %appdata% using jQuery
[13:49:34] <doug_> Matthewk http://jsfiddle.net/6meqrw9x/
[13:51:32] <doug_> rn10950: no, but you can store it on their machine in some implementation defined directory
[13:51:38] <rn10950> ?
[13:52:06] <doug_> rn10950: localstorage
[13:52:12] <rn10950> cookies?
[13:52:25] <rn10950> and this is MSIE 6
[13:52:43] <doug_> http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
[13:52:51] <doug_> D:
[13:53:15] <doug_> I thought IE 6 must die... or something
[13:53:22] <jaspertheghost> guess not lol
[13:54:33] <rn10950> It's an in house app for our remaining 2k and Xp boxes
[13:54:41] <b-lew> I have a bit of javascript to animate a banner in and out of the browser... I can't figure out why the animate takes so long to trigger.
[13:54:51] <doug_> jaspertheghost: how about if you post the data to the server then set the location.href to a url that fetches what you just posted, that returns headers that tell the browser it is a file download
[13:54:59] <b-lew> works fine with fadeIn and fadeOut but if I use opacity it slows it down quite a bit.
[13:55:27] <doug_> jaspertheghost: the user would become involved though
[13:55:46] <Paradisee> hello again :D
[13:56:00] <Paradisee> i get an src value of an element by: var img_url = clone.prop('src');
[13:56:28] <Paradisee> but now i need to split it out, to just give me the name on the image...like: "image.png"
[13:56:50] <Paradisee> and later on have also to add this: "image_off.png/image_on.png"
[13:56:55] <Paradisee> is there an easy way to do this?
[13:57:08] <jaspertheghost> html isnt going to let you write to the server
[13:57:15] <jaspertheghost> thats what server scripting languages are for
[13:57:19] <jaspertheghost> PHP, python etc..
[13:57:30] <jaspertheghost> all u can do do is HTML5 storage
[13:57:36] <jaspertheghost> and i doubt ie 6 even supports it lol
[13:58:41] <doug_> Paradisee: var urlmatch = 'http://foo.com/bar.html'.match(/\/([^/]*)$/), name = urlmatch ? urlmatch[1] : '';
[13:58:46] <rn10950> doug_: What I'm attemting to do is embed a small page in a VB6 window for a to-do list. I'm using MSHTML control in VB6, in which I would like to update the local file in the %appdata% folder, so when the user clicks the save button on the webpage, the source file updates
[13:58:58] <doug_> replace 'http://...' with a variable that has the url
[13:59:08] <Paradisee> doug_: i think i will use data attr instead :D
[13:59:18] <rn10950> I am trying not to use any server side scriptiong
[13:59:22] <rn10950> scripting*
[13:59:37] <doug_> rn10950: well, good luck writing the filesystem from ie js
[13:59:41] <doug_> 6*
[14:00:21] <doug_> rn10950: a cookie can work if the size is reasonable though
[14:00:47] <dave_3> hi there i'm trying to make the button bouncing effect as it is on http://www.hotelbeauchamps.com/ to here http://www.imagefix.co.uk/whitedem_02/ any help on this
[14:01:39] <rn10950> whats the max for cookies in ie6 again?
[14:01:41] <doug_> rn10950: you can catch events from outside the vb6 html container thing?
[14:01:57] <doug_> rn10950: perhaps you could raise an event inside the page and handle it in vb6
[14:02:01] <rn10950> the whole thing is a browser control
[14:02:14] <rn10950> so basically a browser w/ no toolbars
[14:02:31] <doug_> rn10950: pages simply can't write the filesystem (I HOPE!!!!)
[14:02:39] <doug_> rn10950: but the vb6 code can
[14:03:01] <rn10950> I figured because it's in the local intranet zone it could
[14:03:25] <doug_> rn10950: that is more likely a reason NOT to allow it. browser ajax gets way more strict locally
[14:03:29] <b-lew> anyone experience a delay with animation on scroll before?
[14:03:48] <doug_> rn10950: for obvious reasons
[14:05:22] <matthewk> doug_: thanks again, that was helpful for me to learn that function
[14:06:30] <doug_> matthewk: no problem. that is more a "functional style", which is very concise
[14:08:39] <doug_> dave_3: I suggest css animation for that - to maximize smoothness
[14:08:44] <respek> can anyone point me in the direction of a good resource for doing tabs with ajax content inside of them? It's a bit outside my depth, but I'd like to learn
[14:09:07] <rn10950> doug_: Thank you, I will see if I could just read the DOm from VB6 and save that way.
[14:09:12] <respek> (not a good resource even, but if anyone else uses a known structure to accomplish things like this I'd love to hear about it)
[14:09:30] <P0rk> do radio buttons send mouseup and mousedown events before the change event?
[14:10:23] <P0rk> better yet, how do you make a input[type=radio] element so that it can be deselected like a checkbox?
[14:10:38] <doug_> rn10950: are you sure? the js code might be able to raise an event with a json string of the dom then the vb6 just stuffs one string into the file. js way might be easier if you can trial-run raising an event with "hello world" and getting it from vb
[14:10:42] <BillCriswell> P0rk: .prop('checked', false) I believe
[14:11:04] <doug_> rn10950: either way should work though
[14:11:37] <P0rk> BillCriswell, got that part, can't figure out which event to do that on...
[14:11:46] <P0rk> it doesn't fire the change event if it is already selected
[14:11:54] <dave_3> doug_ i'm actually using css animation how do i make it work more smoothly ? transition?
[14:11:57] <P0rk> and the mouseup and mousedown events don't seem to be firing
[14:12:17] <BillCriswell> P0rk: You want to make the radio button unselectable or something?
[14:13:21] <P0rk> I want the feature of the radio button where only one option is selectable. But I also want to be able to unselect all options
[14:13:45] <P0rk> some questions you might click yes, then change you mind and want to leave it blank.
[14:13:54] <P0rk> that's not an option with default radio button behavior
[14:15:04] <doug_> rn10950: ie6 cookie limit 4KB per cookie, 20 cookies per domain
[14:15:08] <doug_> fyi :D
[14:16:02] <doug_> funny how similar 6 and sucks are. coincidence?
[14:17:44] <doug_> dave_3: where's the animation?
[14:18:36] <dave_3> http://www.imagefix.co.uk/whitedem_02/ (bounce)
[14:19:30] <doug_> dave_3: my screen is 1366x768 typical laptop resolution
[14:19:56] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/gT7tu/ -> is there a way to get this to animate right away when you hover off of the div?
[14:20:04] <NoiseEee> P0rk: i think people typically implement a 'ctrl-click' to do that; google
[14:20:23] <doug_> dave_3: I think I can't see it
[14:20:25] <NoiseEee> P0rk: but again, perhaps you after a checkbox.
[14:21:29] <doug_> lol it's funny how often people try to shoehorn some other behavior onto checkboxes and radio buttons. trust me, you don't want to invent new stuff with UIs, go with what people expect
[14:22:27] <BillCriswell> Sounds like a checkbox to me.
[14:28:45] <Paradisee> how can i put a condition here: http://dpaste.com/37QPZ1S
[14:28:53] <Paradisee> to change value.url ?
[14:29:01] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/o960o8z9/1/ -> trying to speed up this animation on scroll so it much quicker. seems like when I scroll up the animation takes place but is delayed quite a bit.
[14:29:11] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you can't.
[14:29:25] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: wut
[14:29:26] <robertmaxrees> you have to do it before you make that call.
[14:30:08] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you need to use an iife or a conditional.
[14:30:26] <b-lew> seems like the .css property takes place much faster for some reason.
[14:31:11] <Paradisee> robertmaxrees: like how?
[14:31:49] <decx> b-lew never do lookups on scroll
[14:31:56] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to separate paragraphs that contain YouTube thumbnail links, but how come `!hasTextBefore(text)` won't return positive for the first case? If I remove it everything else seems to work: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/we1qenh0/22/
[14:31:56] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee to which one?
[14:32:20] <b-lew> what do you mean lookups decx?
[14:32:27] <decx> precache your selectors
[14:32:32] <doug_> frank_o: link doesnt work
[14:32:50] <frank_o> Oopsie, doug_ http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/22/
[14:32:53] <decx> and have a boolean to check against so you dont repeat the same html and animate when the element is already on screen
[14:33:01] <doug_> b-lew: $('.foo') means "lookup everything with class foo"
[14:33:10] <frank_o> decx: Do note I *will* do this server-side at some point
[14:33:24] <b-lew> is there a good fix for that?
[14:33:32] <b-lew> for on the window scroll?
[14:33:39] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee http://fixee.org/paste/5q3gaps/ these are your two options.
[14:33:52] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you need to change the value of that property before your code runs.
[14:33:54] <Paradisee> i made a condition before
[14:33:56] <doug_> b-lew: store it and reuse it. var foo = $('.foo'); ... use foo repeatedly, no lookup needed...
[14:34:01] <robertmaxrees> Paradisee you mean a conditional?
[14:34:13] <Paradisee> an if
[14:34:25] <b-lew> I see, need to put the animation in a function and call the function in the scroll right?
[14:34:28] <robertmaxrees> you cannot use an if statement when setting object properties when inside the object already
[14:34:35] <b-lew> right doug_
[14:34:40] <robertmaxrees> unless you do a conditional or an IIFE.
[14:34:53] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/065EE5Y
[14:34:56] <Paradisee> that's what i mean
[14:35:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah you can do that instead.
[14:35:39] <decx> b-lew i'd also skip the animate() and use css transitions instead
[14:35:52] <b-lew> well we need to support ie7
[14:36:04] <robertmaxrees> you poor bastard
[14:36:07] <decx> with a class the new rules still gets applied just without the animation
[14:36:10] <robertmaxrees> are the animations critical in old IE?
[14:41:04] <b-lew> http://jsfiddle.net/o960o8z9/3/ -> is this any better decx?
[14:41:22] <doug_> frank_o: I have an idea, 1 sec
[14:41:39] <decx> no b-lew
[14:42:02] <decx> you look up .target anew on every scroll tick (depending on browser this happens A LOT)
[14:42:05] <b-lew> I put the animation in a function I thought that'd help
[14:42:26] <b-lew> hummm do you have an example of what I need to do?
[14:42:27] <decx> just var target = $('.target') beforehand
[14:42:37] <decx> outside of the scroll event function
[14:43:30] <b-lew> how do I indicated if the div is in the viewport or not then?
[14:44:14] <decx> huh?
[14:44:20] <robertmaxrees> you don't have to select it again.
[14:44:30] <decx> you just call target.is_visible() instead of $('.target').is_visible()
[14:44:35] <robertmaxrees> you check the cached version's offset compared to the current viewport.
[14:44:41] <frank_o> doug_: awesome:D
[14:45:05] <decx> also you want a third option where it's on screen but already animated in so you dont repeat that every tick that it's visible
[14:45:15] <decx> them repaints
[14:46:12] <b-lew> I'm unsure how to do that. I need to check on scroll if the div is in the viewport, if so, then animated the banner into the window
[14:46:18] <b-lew> if not, then hide it.
[14:47:42] <doug_> frank_o: jQuery('.youtube').each(function() { var cont = jQuery(this).parent().contents(), idx = cont.index(this), after = cont.slice(idx+1); console.log("efore: ", idx, "after:", after); })
[14:47:55] <doug_> that probably lets you split it up like you wanted
[14:47:58] <decx> when you do the animation the first time you set a bool to true, and only when it's outside of the screen you set that to false again. otherwise you repeat the animation again and again when the element is on screen already
[14:48:07] <P0rk> NoiseEee, thanks for the reply. I definitely want a radio button and my customers are not likely to know what the ctrl key is. Certainly incapable of much more than a single click.
[14:48:17] <decx> you dont notice it because it changes the element to the same thing, but it's not nice
[14:48:45] <decx> scroll functions are finicky
[14:49:02] <doug_> frank_o: idx tells you how far into cont is the stuff before the .youtube. after tells you the index of cont to start for stuff after .youtube. I think :D
[14:50:05] <doug_> I should change my nick to PassiveVoice :D
[14:50:34] <P0rk> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/wvxyx52m/20/ ugly, and uses checkboxes but seems like way too much work.
[14:51:18] <doug_> frank_o: .contents "flattens" the descendents into one linear list of elements. then .index finds the .youtube. then .slice chops the list
[14:51:35] <doug_> .index returns the index in the collection where it found it
[14:52:42] <b-lew> huh, is there some example code I can look at? I'm game if that works properly!
[14:52:48] <frank_o> doug_: im a little bit lost. i added it to http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/fqwow5rr/2/ but what exactly am i supposed to do next?
[14:53:23] <doug_> frank_o: let me see if I can make it dump what you want at the end, to verify my implementation can really work. 1 sec
[14:53:50] <frank_o> sounds pretty wild
[14:56:20] <doug_> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/23/
[14:56:27] <doug_> see chunk of code at the bottom
[14:58:25] <frank_o> doug_: oh my goodness :)
[14:59:12] <b-lew> Is there a chance to get an example of a bool for the animate stuff on scroll?
[15:01:27] <decx> here's a basic example b-lew
[15:01:33] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/k6recar6/
[15:01:54] <decx> look at the console and scroll
[15:02:05] <decx> the addClass() only ever gets applied to the new div
[15:02:12] <b-lew> I'll take a look at this thanks so much!
[15:02:21] <decx> now remove && !$(this).hasClass('yep'); and look at the console again
[15:02:31] <decx> it adds up
[15:02:41] <decx> doesnt matter with addClass because browsers are smart nowadays
[15:02:50] <decx> but with your animate and html() calls it does matter
[15:05:27] <frank_o> doug_: first of all thank you so much. what a blessing
[15:05:44] <frank_o> doug_: second -- looks like it's working really well: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/25/
[15:06:18] <frank_o> for a start at least
[15:06:30] <decx> are you still doing this youtube embed dom massace frank_o ?
[15:06:50] <decx> by now you could've written a script to clean that shit up on the backend -.-
[15:06:55] <b-lew> man that is much more complex that I had hoped.
[15:07:12] <doug_> frank_o: glad to help
[15:07:30] <decx> b-lew it's a pretty obscure optimization, if you just add a class and do it with transition it doesnt really matter
[15:07:33] <frank_o> decx: im not that good with ruby :S
[15:07:48] <frank_o> decx: DOM massage?
[15:07:55] <decx> massacre
[15:07:57] <frank_o> or DOM massacre not sure which you meant
[15:08:00] <frank_o> yeah lol
[15:08:20] <decx> it's a markup calamity ^^
[15:08:27] <doug_> frank_o: difficulty goes up a lot when you are start to deal with subtrees of elements. people rarely need it so they aren't exposed to ways of dealing with it
[15:08:42] <b-lew> so i should add a class to the .banner to animate it.
[15:08:49] <decx> that's what i'd do
[15:08:57] <decx> animate() is shit
[15:09:06] <decx> sorry animate() :(
[15:09:51] <b-lew> okay I'll need to rethink about how I am approaching this.
[15:10:00] <frank_o> doug_: sounds like you've had to deal with this stuff though?
[15:10:14] <doug_> yes
[15:11:25] <frank_o> im glad:D
[15:11:36] <decx> b-lew also as a rule of thumb, if you use a selector more than once then precache it
[15:12:44] <decx> it will make it more maintainable without having to find&replace all the time when you change a class name or something
[15:19:31] <doug_> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/o4uguntu/28/
[15:23:08] <frank_o> doug_: i guess that negates what i was working on: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/29/
[15:23:43] <frank_o> doug_: is your example capable of handling random occurences of youtubes?
[15:23:54] <frank_o> * of youtubes and text
[15:24:13] <doug_> frank_o: just showing what I would do to implement that <p>before</p><p>youtube</p>... spec
[15:24:34] <frank_o> ah ok
[15:28:05] <frank_o> doug_: ill see if theres a way they can merge. one thing about http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/o4uguntu/29/ though is that `!beforeText && afterText` and `beforeText && afterText` work fine but not `beforeText && !afterText`
[15:29:24] <frank_o> i really like that resultDiv stuff very clean like a neurosurgeon's touch
[15:30:39] <decx> a neurosurgeon with stubby fingers ^^
[15:31:02] <frank_o> gonna try to make it replace the existing divs directly though. these divs actually have some other stuff that i'd rather not duplicate as well like avatars, post options and what not
[15:31:22] <frank_o> decx: you've seen doug's fingers?
[15:32:16] <decx> what do they say.. putting lipstick on a pig
[15:32:33] <frank_o> yeah they do say that dont they :P
[15:32:52] <decx> you're still shuffling around the markup like a madman in something that should be done backend :D
[15:33:45] <frank_o> yeah uhm
[15:33:59] <frank_o> maybe i should try /j #ruby-lang
[15:34:38] <frank_o> add a new method to my existing "user post sanitizer"
[15:36:44] <frank_o> decx: oh no wait no can do. youtube embeds are just regular links before jquery-embedly gets to process them, so this can't be done backend=/
[15:37:41] <frank_o> * regular links until
[15:38:02] <decx> that's why you put an extra field in your backend called youtube embed
[15:38:48] <frank_o> decx: but then there's vimeo, vine, soundcloud, bandcamp etc.
[15:39:33] <decx> that's when you put your foot down and say: that's enough of your shit your stupid enduser
[15:39:36] <decx> *you
[15:39:41] <frank_o> jquery-embedly is nice because it processes all urls and if it notices something it supports it'll go ahead and turn it into a clickable thumbnail
[15:39:50] <frank_o> hehe
[15:55:59] <doug_> frank_o yes it should handle getting the text of all of the siblings before and after any instance of .youtube on the page
[15:57:46] <doug_> decx: lol, exactly. vimeo = crasheo
[15:58:13] <doug_> vimeo actually corrupts the state of chrome and causes very strange behavior
[15:58:19] <doug_> leading to freeze usually
[15:58:33] <doug_> last time I tried to use vimeo anyway
[15:59:24] <doug_> there was already a bug open
[15:59:37] <doug_> for a looong time
[16:00:00] <doug_> google lets bugs sit for years sometimes
[16:00:16] <doug_> as do all big companies
[16:01:27] <doug_> it could even be interpreted as anti-competitive behavior - google not rushing to the rescue of a competing video site
[16:01:47] <doug_> by fixing their browser "conveniently" crashing when playing vimeo
[16:17:45] <tlm> whats the benifit of delcaring an array using: var arr = []; over: arr = [];
[16:17:46] <tlm> ??
[16:17:52] <tlm> both work
[16:20:00] <tlm> berban]
[16:23:21] <tlm> nvmd found out :]
[16:56:26] <bricker`work> How does jqxhr determine a "failure"? I am getting a 200 response back from a request but the failure function is being run. https://gist.github.com/bricker/a7226bbead5e3c2cbc9c
[17:04:22] <shwackd> can anybody help me with a cross domain json response?
[17:12:14] <shwackd> please? I've been trying to figure this out all day
[17:12:57] <shwackd> $.getJSON("https://cex.io/api/ticker/WDC/BTC/?callback=?",function(data){console.log(data);});
[17:13:05] <shwackd> I somebody knows how to make this work
[17:21:38] <thinkxl> shwackd: do you have CORS enabled or the server allow JSONP ?
[18:00:55] <shwackd> thinkxl sadly no on both
[18:01:13] <shwackd> I tried to use CORS it didn't work
[18:01:51] <shwackd> I was using a json to jsonp service at jsonp.nodejitsu.com but now that's down. Is there really no simple way to retreive a json object from another domain?
[18:20:27] <doug_> shwackd: yes, use jsonp directly
[18:20:43] <doug_> you dont need a service for jsonp if it is json
[18:22:02] <doug_> $.get('http://foo.com', null, null, 'jsonp').done(function(json) { ... })   should work
[18:22:55] <shwackd> doug_ I will try right now thank you one second
[18:24:29] <shwackd> $.get('https://cex.io/api/ticker/WDC/BTC/', null, null, 'jsonp').done(function(json) {alert('done')})
[18:25:15] <shwackd> It return the object I want, but I get this error 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token : '  and the success function with alert is never called
[18:27:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like bad data maybe.
[18:27:59] <shwackd> yeah maybe
[18:28:08] <shwackd> when I visit the URL directly I get a seemingly valid response
[18:28:13] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[18:28:23] <robertmaxrees> use this instead.
[18:28:26] <robertmaxrees> or $.ajax()_
[18:28:41] <shwackd> I achieved the same results using tha tmethod
[18:28:52] <shwackd> the object was returned but the same unexpected token error
[18:29:36] <shwackd> Thank you for your help. I will try these methods with other APIs  / JSON objects and see if I still get that error. Hopefully you guys will still be in here in 20-30 minutes
[18:29:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm about to leave.
[18:30:47] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[18:38:04] <doug_> shwackd:  $.getJSON('https://cex.io/api/ticker/WDC/BTC/').done(function(json) { console.log('result', json); }).fail(function() { console.error.apply(console, ["failed"].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))); })
[18:38:07] <doug_> fails though
[18:46:35] <Mark___> doy anybody know how to make preloader using jquery?
[18:46:38] <Mark___> or html5
[18:49:56] <doug_> shwackd: wow, I guess it is blocked because of https
[18:50:22] <doug_> I debugged through it and there's nothing there when you try to read the source of the script tag
[18:50:59] <doug_> shwackd: http://www.corsproxy.com/
[19:08:00] <doug_> shwackd: proxy through your own server
[19:09:21] <doug_> shwackd: meaning, add an endpoint in your backend you can GET from, and the backend fetches the url from the real site and forwards the response as a response to your GET
[19:10:06] <doug_> shwackd: those proxy sites aren't doing anything much more complex than a hello world node server :D
[19:19:44] <shwackd> hm
[19:20:07] <shwackd> doug_ do you mean something like creating a php page that performs the GET then requesting ajax from the php page on my own server?
[19:21:07] <doug_> shwackd: I might be able to make a server for you, 1 sec
[19:21:15] <doug_> it's like a fiddle for server stuff
[19:21:31] <doug_> yes
[19:21:53] <shwackd> cuz the thing is, the API cannot take more than 1 request per second without banning IP, so I need the calls to be client side from my visitors
[19:22:24] <doug_> shwackd: with a proper server implementation, you can have a cache that expires every n seconds, and make it always quick for users
[19:22:37] <shwackd> yes I'm just kind of new
[19:22:49] <doug_> shwackd: in a way, doing a server implementation will make it possible to limit the rate
[19:22:50] <shwackd> and my way if there are no visitors there are zero requests
[19:23:02] <doug_> shwackd: my way too
[19:23:12] <shwackd> ok
[19:23:16] <shwackd> I'll be happy to try
[19:24:09] <snowinferno|work> Hi all, when does the error method of $.ajax get invoked? If the status code returned is not 200?
[19:28:31] <shwackd> doug_ will I be able to run this file on my own server?
[19:31:51] <doug_> shwackd: you use php? or what
[19:32:00] <shwackd> not normally but I do when I ahve to
[19:32:13] <doug_> is it a vm where you can run nodejs?
[19:32:38] <shwackd> It's a VPS
[19:32:50] <Mark___> does anybody know how to keep my website dark when the preloader is on?
[19:32:57] <doug_> perfect
[19:33:02] <doug_> shwackd: http://jsapp.us/#s498.js
[19:33:45] <doug_> shwackd: pass a number to .listen to put it on some custom port, then specify a port number when you ajax request it
[19:34:17] <doug_> once that works it is trivial to make it limit requests to the external site
[19:35:32] <shwackd> I dont understand what you're asking me to do by passin ga number to .listen I'm sorry :(     I am still learning and very new
[19:36:13] <shwackd> I have to yet to even SSH into my vps... i only upload files with sftp and change settings in the web control panel
[19:40:08] <shwackd> doug_ I will try and read up on node.js so I can better understand what you've asked
[19:40:23] <shwackd> thank you very much for the help. I'll try my best to see it through
[19:57:44] <shwackd> oh nevermind I ddin't see .listen() at the bottom of your code
[19:57:55] <shwackd> I think that makes it a lot more clera
[20:48:51] <[m]adman> http://hayageek.com/docs/jquery-upload-file.php
[20:49:15] <[m]adman> anyone have an idea how to count the amount of multiple files submitted for an upload?
[20:50:22] <[m]adman> the script injects a form element with the same class name.. the class name is dynamically generated.. if it were static I wouldn't have a problem here lol
[20:50:46] <[m]adman> <form style=​"display:​block;​ position:​absolute;​left:​ 150px;​" class=​"ajax-file-upload-1413604016707" method=​"POST" action=​"upload.php" enctype=​"multipart/​form-data">​</form>
[20:53:09] <[m]adman> nvm... I found DIVs also injected with the "ajax-file-upload-filename" class.. easier to count that
[20:53:38] <[m]adman> I guess really my question is to tell when ALL files are finished uploading..
[20:53:50] <shwackd> I can't believe how annoying it is to get json from cross domains this is absurd
[20:53:52] <[m]adman> the files don't get uploaded all at once, they're uploaded separately..
[20:54:07] <shwackd> should b easier
[20:55:03] <[m]adman> right now my current guess is to ++ a var count on each success
[21:13:08] <ragas> > typeof
[21:13:17] <ragas> ;
[22:26:14] <boxatom> Hellow!   Can anyone tell me how to know if a radio button is undefined because it is unchecked?
[22:26:50] <TylerB23> Sure!
[22:27:07] <boxatom> you see i am getting the value by      				objectToSend['answer'+i] = $('input[name=answer'+i+']:checked').val();         but if the user did not check …  it says undefined    and laravel says 500!
[22:28:06] <TylerB23> Are you running 'i' through a for loop?
[22:28:34] <boxatom> i am.. but and if i check all of the radios its all good
[22:29:01] <boxatom> its when one gets no selection… it says undefined
[22:29:38] <TylerB23> Hmmm, okay give me a second to let me think about this
[22:30:15] <boxatom> im trying to  do    … if(typeof (objectToSend['answer'+i] === ‘undefined’) {objectToSend['answer'+i] =‘u’;}
[22:33:48] <TylerB23> Try putting the index variable like this objectToSend['answer'][i] = ...
[22:34:40] <boxatom> I just fixed it!  ….
[22:34:58] <TylerB23> Nice! What was it?
[22:35:00] <boxatom> checking for undefined is a waste of time…. the thing that worked was checking for null
[22:35:21] <TylerB23> ahh yes! I was actually going to recommend that, but if it was returning undefined I figured the typeof would work
[22:35:50] <boxatom> java conslole calls it undefined…. it should say null :D
[22:36:13] <TylerB23> lol yes it should.
[22:36:43] <boxatom> ill add to my todo list… check what is the big difference between undefined and null
[22:37:11] <TylerB23> undefined is a variable that has no value, while null can actually serve as a value
[22:37:18] <TylerB23> at least in PHP lol
[22:37:38] <boxatom> grr so many languages… but i guess that is kind of a good thing…
[22:37:57] <boxatom> in the future there will only be swift
[22:38:07] <TylerB23> lol there are soooo many. Many of them have similarities.
[22:38:13] <TylerB23> haha you really think so?
[22:38:28] <boxatom> just wishfull thinking that the world would come to an agreement
[22:38:46] <boxatom> focus on one and make it all powerfull
[22:38:48] <TylerB23> Have you worked with Swift?
[22:39:04] <boxatom> no, just heard some reviews that it’s good
[22:39:07] <boxatom> ibm likes it
[22:39:30] <boxatom> must probably im a bit brain washed by the keynotes
[22:39:44] <TylerB23> haha yeah Apple's pretty good at doing that sort of thing
[22:40:48] <boxatom> at least Yosemite is free
[22:41:06] <TylerB23> Yeah I like it, except Chrome keeps lagging
[22:41:18] <boxatom> Safari just got better
[22:41:30] <boxatom> thats a way to force you in to safari
[22:41:47] <TylerB23> hah right
[22:42:08] <boxatom> i like that safari freezes flash… makes my computer happier
[22:42:47] <TylerB23> Flash is almost obsolete now because the major browsers are starting to stop support lol
[22:42:56] <TylerB23> Or apple at least
[22:43:35] <boxatom> so then… what is the way to animate?
[22:43:42] <boxatom> besides video… css?
[22:43:48] <TylerB23> HTML5/JS
[22:43:58] <TylerB23> You can do amazing things with the HTML5 Canvas
[22:43:58] <boxatom> mmm
[22:44:17] <boxatom> yet no 3d right?
[22:44:51] <TylerB23> No not yet. It's proposed in ECMA 2.0 I believe, but not sure it will make the cut
[22:45:03] <boxatom> there must be some sort of plugin for canvas to make it simpler
[22:45:13] <TylerB23> er ECMA6 lol
[22:45:18] <TylerB23> not 2
[22:45:26] <visua> You can can use WebGL for 3d.
[22:45:38] <boxatom> Or unity
[22:45:39] <TylerB23> Ah, there ya go!
[22:45:57] <visua> Yeah i use unity, however the WebGL build doesn't exist yet.
[22:46:12] <boxatom> unity 5 ….
[22:46:23] <visua> It's not going to be out for a while
[22:46:30] <visua> 4.6 is still in beta
[22:46:35] <boxatom> still waiting for .6
[22:46:44] <boxatom> i will not dowload beta
[22:46:50] <visua> my web player has a bug in safari :(
[22:46:51] <visua> http://www.michaelnovia.net/lost/
[22:47:02] <visua> works fine in chrome, though.
[22:47:44] <boxatom> worked on my safari
[22:47:53] <visua> hrm

[22:51:37] <boxatom> thanks
[23:07:20] <cryptbin> I'm about to pull my hair out with what should be a very simple thing to do. I have a very basic tab setup except there is a tab on the end to create new tabs which are done with .append.  The new tabs are created with a close button on them and when that is clicked it should remove the tab (and its content - which works) and then trigger a click on the next tab, or the previous one if the next tab doesn't exist. I can't for the life of my get that
[23:07:20] <cryptbin> triggered click to work.
[23:07:53] <cryptbin> The tab it's trying to click is loaded with the DOM too, it's not created via append.
[23:08:46] <tinkiete> hi folks
[23:09:13] <doug_> cryptbin: do you have a fiddle or something to look at?
[23:10:23] <doug_> cryptbin: what is the selector you use to select the "other" tab(s)?
[23:10:26] <cryptbin> doug_, do you mind if I pm you a live URL to check it out?
[23:10:33] <doug_> cryptbin: that's fine
[23:40:50] <Mark___> can anyone take a look at my website and tell me what the problem is that im having here?
