[00:03:42] <TechMonger> Hello. can someone help me figure out why button 3-6 disables all previous buttons
[00:03:53] <TechMonger> if you click button 1 and 2 back and forth they work fine
[08:07:18] <Justce_W> Hi, i got issues with centos and whm where autossl just fails to show information (loading forever pages etc) anyone with the same experiance ?
[08:09:46] <Cork> Justce_W: wrong channel
[08:10:45] <Justce_W> gah :P
[08:10:56] <Cork> :)
[12:30:25] <chriys> How can I perform an operation when an iteration like $.map is done ?
[12:32:16] <robertmaxrees> chriys you put it after the call to $.map
[12:32:21] <robertmaxrees> it's sychronous
[12:33:12] <chriys> is it the same with each ?
[12:33:18] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[12:33:33] <chriys> thanks going to try that
[12:33:34] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[12:36:25] <chriys> basically I want to do this => $('.class').each((index, element) => { // ajax call }).then(() => { console.log(); // or whatever else I want to do });
[12:36:29] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> so that's different heh.
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> because ajax calls ARE async.
[12:36:54] <robertmaxrees> obviously :P
[12:37:06] <robertmaxrees> so really, you want to run something when all of the ajax calls are done, yeah?
[12:37:20] <chriys> Yeah :D
[12:37:33] <robertmaxrees> heh, slightly different beast.
[12:38:14] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways - my favorite is to map over all the ajax calls, then use $.when on that array.
[12:38:56] <chriys> robertmaxrees: well the array has a piece of information I need for the ajax
[12:39:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> mind showing me what you mean in a fiddle?
[12:39:29] <robertmaxrees> (it's fine if the ajax call doesn't work)
[12:39:39] <chriys> ok give me a sec
[12:48:24] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeeee
[12:48:26] <chriys> robertmaxrees: here is the code https://jsfiddle.net/xpkbq9ye/6/
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> okay so a coupla things.
[12:49:45] <robertmaxrees> class=".Calendar-date" totally unrelated but this won't work :)
[12:49:45] <chriys> yeahh
[12:49:52] <robertmaxrees> also: do you control the api for this?
[12:50:49] <robertmaxrees> and finally - do you want to do something after the each is done, or after all the ajax calls are done?
[12:50:57] <chriys> robertmaxrees: yeah I control the api. what do you mean by won't work ?
[12:51:12] <chriys> after each is done
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> so you don't care if the ajax calls have finished?
[12:51:27] <chriys> and I guess that each ends when the ajax is done right ?
[12:51:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:51:37] <robertmaxrees> the each simply fires the ajax calls.
[12:51:50] <robertmaxrees> it fires one then keeps moving on - it doesn't wait until the ajax call finishes.
[12:51:56] <chriys> Ohhhh I need the ajax to be done.
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> for the "won't work" - <ul>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees>   <li class=".Calendar-date" data-vehicle="vehicle_1">vehicle</li>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees>   <li class=".Calendar-date" data-vehicle="vehicle_2">vehicle</li>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees>   <li class=".Calendar-date" data-vehicle="vehicle_3">vehicle</li>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees>   <li class=".Calendar-date" data-vehicle="vehicle_4">vehicle</li>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees>   <li class=".Calendar-date" data-vehicle="vehicle_5">vehicle</li>
[12:52:09] <robertmaxrees> </ul>
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> woops!
[12:52:13] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[12:52:31] <chriys> ohh sorry for the type
[12:52:34] <robertmaxrees> class=".Calendar-date" - the period at the start of the classname is bad.
[12:52:35] <chriys> typo*
[12:52:38] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:52:50] <robertmaxrees> anyway - so I would first of all fix your API.
[12:52:52] <chriys> I actually don't have that in my code
[12:53:06] <chriys> what do you mean by fixing
[12:53:26] <robertmaxrees> if the vehicleId is relevant to your data, the api should respond with it.
[12:53:37] <robertmaxrees> it'll also make the frontend code MUCH simpler.
[12:54:00] <chriys> it does respond with the vehicleId
[12:54:31] <chriys> as you're typing have this ideas.
[12:54:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:55:14] <chriys> I could pass an array of ids to the api so that I'll have only one ajax to do
[12:55:31] <chriys> then when that ajax is done I'll do whatever I need to do :D
[12:55:36] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:55:38] <robertmaxrees> there's another way :)
[12:55:47] <chriys> please speak your mind :D
[12:55:52] <robertmaxrees> gimme a sec.
[12:56:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xpkbq9ye/10/
[12:57:04] <robertmaxrees> the key is the map with that apply.
[12:57:32] <chriys> ohhh ok :p that's a cool trick
[12:57:47] <chriys> why var instead of let ?
[12:57:58] <robertmaxrees> habit.
[12:58:06] <robertmaxrees> though really that should be a const.
[12:58:54] <chriys> ohh ok cool
[12:58:56] <chriys> lemme try
[13:08:18] <chriys> robertmaxrees: it works but not perfectly.
[13:09:00] <chriys> https://jsfiddle.net/xpkbq9ye/6/
[13:09:19] <chriys> the console log inside the ajax is called after the one inside when.apply()
[13:10:52] <robertmaxrees> where's the when?
[13:11:50] <chriys> line 16
[13:12:07] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/iWdL0FM.png ?
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> did you save your changes?
[13:12:55] <chriys> how do u save ?
[13:13:07] <robertmaxrees> click "update" and then share the new url.,
[13:13:29] <chriys> https://jsfiddle.net/xpkbq9ye/12/
[13:13:30] <chriys> thx
[13:14:47] <robertmaxrees> so it's logging out of order, but do you have the data you need?
[13:15:08] <chriys> no unfortunately
[13:15:17] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:15:20] <robertmaxrees> const ajaxCalls = $vehicles.each((index, vehicleId) => {
[13:15:25] <robertmaxrees> you have to map./
[13:15:28] <robertmaxrees> it's not an each.
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> and actually.
[13:15:43] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xpkbq9ye/16/ try this.
[13:16:04] <robertmaxrees> swapped to a map and added that .get()
[13:17:27] <robertmaxrees> the reason it was out of order is because you can't return out of an .each() like that - you were just getting a bunch of jquery objects.
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> so they were all resolve already.
[13:17:39] <robertmaxrees> *resolveds
[13:17:43] <robertmaxrees> wtf lol cannot type today.
[13:17:55] <chriys> ::::D
[13:17:58] <chriys> it works
[13:18:11] <chriys> but allow few questions.
[13:18:26] <chriys> why map instead of each ? why the .get()
[13:18:27] <robertmaxrees> ?
[13:18:27] <chriys> ?
[13:18:33] <robertmaxrees> read above.
[13:18:37] <robertmaxrees> for the map and not each.
[13:18:51] <cannap> ?
[13:19:09] <chriys> and about the .get()
[13:19:13] <cannap> ¿
[13:19:25] <robertmaxrees> the .get() changes it from a jquery object to an actual array.
[13:19:46] <chriys> ohh ok
[13:20:50] <chriys> thanks a lot
[13:21:06] <robertmaxrees> definitely :)
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[13:40:40] <vish93> Hey guys I have a back to top anchor like so https://pastebin.com/9hjymS5v but now in safari it is not working. Would anyone be able to kindly help me see why this is happening?
[13:42:07] <robertmaxrees> make return t("html").animate({ into return t("body,html").animate({ and see if that works
[13:43:49] <robertmaxrees> vish93
[13:45:19] <vish93> robertmaxrees: that has made it work, but previously I had removed it, as won’t that be firing twice?
[13:45:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:45:29] <robertmaxrees> just once.
[13:45:52] <robertmaxrees> it has to do with how safari works vs other browsers.
[13:51:19] <vish93> Strange.
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> that's safari for ya
[13:54:50] <vish93> Im pretty sure it was working previously before I used owlcarousel.
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> i've never seen safari with correctly with that.
[13:56:10] <robertmaxrees> at least, not withouit some janky css.
[13:59:44] <vish93> robertmaxrees: Yes, I agree with you.
[14:23:21] <catbadger> so i accidentally got my account locked on github for too many attempts (yeah capslock and not enough caffiene) anyone know how long lockouts last for on github?
[14:24:46] <catbadger> anyone?
[14:25:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to look at the help docs.
[14:26:36] <robertmaxrees> "We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting." -> https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/
[14:26:46] <catbadger> tyv
[14:26:47] <catbadger> m
[14:27:39] <catbadger> erg.. no answer there
[14:28:28] <robertmaxrees> https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/#contact-us
[14:28:37] <ahoo> my linter complains about $ being an implicitly declared global variable and that i should prefix it with "window."
[14:28:50] <catbadger> fix your linter
[14:28:57] <catbadger> using jslint?
[14:29:01] <catbadger> use jshint
[14:29:22] <robertmaxrees> you can also define globals.
[14:29:24] <catbadger> jslint is famous for being an antagonistic piece of $hit
[14:29:28] <ahoo> my question is whether it is correct to do so
[14:29:33] <catbadger> no
[14:29:38] <catbadger> the whole point fo the $ is brevity
[14:30:34] <ahoo> my linter is resharper btw.
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, use a module loader so you explicitly include jquery and then you're all good.
[14:31:17] <catbadger> yes
[14:31:17] <ahoo> i'm surprised they didn't take into account jquery and the obvious need for brevity.
[14:31:52] <robertmaxrees> heh, not really surprising.
[14:32:00] <catbadger> ahoo you shouldn't require linting to pass, more like "here's a list of code cleanups you should get around to when you have a spare moment"
[14:32:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't necessarily "special" in that regard.
[14:32:10] <catbadger> it'
[14:32:19] <robertmaxrees> catbadger we require linting to pass in our codebase.
[14:32:23] <robertmaxrees> prevents buildup of issues.
[14:32:29] <catbadger> don't listen to him $, you're special...
[14:32:45] <robertmaxrees> though we have a quality gate that we're slowly lowering.  so not everything currently needs ot pass all the time.
[14:32:48] <catbadger> reobertmaxrees, what linter do you use?
[14:33:05] <catbadger> omg i can't type today
[14:33:15] <robertmaxrees> eslint iirc
[14:33:19] <robertmaxrees> and sonarqube
[14:34:15] <ahoo> catbadger: yes. right.
[14:37:17] <catbadger> my point was, not the same linter, probably you have some flags in there to skip around certain things
[14:37:22] <catbadger> :)
[14:38:49] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/8132307/923919 some good info here.
[16:28:19] <ringzer0> I want to find the xPath of the DIV container that contains the most P (<p>) tags ... any recommendations for how to approach this?
[17:27:35] <robertmaxrees> oontz
