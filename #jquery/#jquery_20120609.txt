[00:17:35] <kinesis> Hi, I have a jquery script that uses .attr, but isn't working after it checks if (..val().length = 32)  can anyone check? http://pastebin.com/NgFJV60w
[00:17:51] <kinesis> trying to enable / disable a button based on string length in the textbox
[00:18:24] <ryanaz> kinesis ==
[00:18:31] <kinesis> ?
[00:18:35] <ryanaz> use == not =
[00:18:40] <ryanaz> = means set .. == is a check
[00:18:45] <kinesis> In the code I do use ==
[00:18:48] <kinesis> pastebin...
[00:18:51] <ryanaz> ah.
[00:19:03] <ryanaz> well, that was my guess. :)
[00:19:27] <sacho> what do you mean, "it isn't working"?
[00:19:29] <ryanaz> why are you using alert instead of console.log() ?
[00:19:29] <kinesis> it'll trigger alert() in the if
[00:19:38] <kinesis> cuz this computer has 1gb of ram
[00:19:44] <kinesis> its a netbook and i hardly have the ram
[00:19:44] <kinesis> :)
[00:19:51] <kinesis> until i step up into a macbook pro
[00:19:52] <ryanaz> so you can't run your javascript console?
[00:20:02] <ryanaz> note: new macbook pro's monday
[00:20:04] <kinesis> i probably can
[00:20:15] <kinesis> ctrl + shift + i in Rockmelt
[00:20:24] <sacho> since when is there an attribute "enabled"?
[00:20:56] <sacho> kinesis, what you want is removeAttr('disabled')
[00:21:49] <kinesis> heh ok
[00:52:29] <kinesis>     private $db_name = $db_user = "md5_verify";
[01:56:45] <Whirl3d> in the loop   for (var prop in obj) {   do stuff }    how do I jump to the next prop and skip the rest of the stuff in do stuff?   for (var prop in obj) { if (prop==
[01:57:50] <psyolus> Whirl3d: continue?
[01:58:00] <Whirl3d> I'll try it. thx
[01:58:52] <psyolus> http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_break.asp
[01:59:24] <Whirl3d> brilliant. thanks.
[02:07:31] <neurochrome> can anyone see anything wrong with this? $(this).animate({ width: "360px"}, {queue:false,duration:500}, function() {$('#search-field').fadeIn();});​
[02:07:53] <neurochrome> the callback function will not run
[02:07:59] <xinming> WHen I use $('form.update-form').submit(function (e) { ... });
[02:08:10] <Whirl3d> callback goes inside the second object
[02:08:16] <Whirl3d> under "complete:"
[02:08:58] <Whirl3d> $(this).animate({ width: "360px"}, {queue:false,duration:500, complete: function() {$('#search-field').fadeIn();}});​
[02:08:58] <xinming> When I click on the submit in one of the form, It seems the handler will be called as many times as the form.update-form count.
[02:09:06] <xinming> Am I do something wrong?
[02:09:32] <xinming> I use $('form.update-form').bind('submit', function (e) { ... });
[02:09:51] <Whirl3d> when you assign a handler to an event, the element that you bind it to fires...if that's every form, then suddenly every form fires.
[02:10:26] <xinming> Whirl3d: Yea, that's what my problem is, Shouldn't the handler be called as we click the submit on the specific form?
[02:10:38] <xinming> Or, What is the right way to achieve this?
[02:11:04] <Whirl3d> try this: $("form.update-form").on("submit", buttonclass, function (e) {stuff});
[02:11:24] <xinming> Whirl3d: thanks, I'll go and read doc for that.
[02:11:44] <Whirl3d> .on is the preferred way to handle events, I believe.
[02:12:07] <Whirl3d> http://api.jquery.com/on
[02:18:07] <xinming> Whirl3d: Do you mean we still need to specify the button class before calling the event handler?
[02:18:35] <Whirl3d> technically, no. But it works best if you do.
[02:19:28] <Whirl3d> if you have multiple submit buttons you can always do "input[type='submit'] or just :submit.....but then it won't catch any scripted calls to submit
[02:19:50] <Whirl3d> it really depends on your implementation
[02:23:13] <xinming> Let me try, thanks, It seems I should attach events to submit button rather than the form.
[02:24:23] <Whirl3d> You could do that too. But keep in mind if you have a script that handles your submit call (without the button click), you won't be able to capture it first
[02:25:01] <Whirl3d> by handling the submit event on the form, you get to intervene before the form is submitted no matter what...
[02:27:09] <xinming> Whirl3d: Do you mean, WHen I have the event handler on submit button, I can intervene the form fields data, But if I write script to handle the submit call without the submit button, I can't get those data?
[02:27:48] <neurochrome> anything blatantly wrong with this callback? $(this).animate({ width: "360px"}, {queue:false,duration:500}, function() {$('#search-field').fadeIn();});​
[02:27:56] <Whirl3d> Let's say you wanted to have a submit button that fires the submit event. You could capture that and validate your form fields before submitting
[02:28:03] <Whirl3d> hold on one second...
[02:28:18] <Whirl3d> neurochrome, I answered your question already. Look back at the log
[02:28:44] <neurochrome> oh, sorry, didn't get mentioned and been dling the humble bundle ;)
[02:29:18] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, yeah, I tried complete too, 2 secs
[02:29:24] <Whirl3d> xinming, but if you have a button ouside the form set to trigger the submit event, it won't let you validate if you only capture the submit event on the internal button.
[02:30:11] <Whirl3d> neurochrome, make a jsfiddle to show the problem. I'm willing to bet it's a typo or missing bracket or something...
[02:30:37] <poppiez> in firefox on macosx, the mousewheel event keeps firing for a few seconds when scrolling. is this because of the "iPhone-like" scrolling it has implemented where it keeps scrolling after you stop?
[02:30:59] <Whirl3d> neurochrome, I separate my animation calls into two parts: css and actions...so all of my animation calls look like $(elem).animate(css, actions);
[02:31:25] <Whirl3d> then in my actions object, I put {duration: num, easing:val, complete:func, queue:false, step:func}
[02:31:43] <xinming> Whirl3d: Alright, Thanks, I got it.
[02:31:53] <Whirl3d> cool
[02:32:17] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, just knocking a jsfidlle up now
[02:32:29] <Whirl3d> be gentle..lol
[02:32:58] <Whirl3d> poppiez, I am not sure. Never heard of that before
[02:35:09] <poppiez> Whirl3d: I think that's what happens. if you scroll fast and stop, it fires around 5-6 mousewheel events after that
[02:35:33] <Whirl3d> are you animating the scroll function?
[02:35:39] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/tmsnv/
[02:36:09] <poppiez> Whirl3d: nope, there is no scroll on the page, html has overflow: hidden;
[02:36:39] <Whirl3d> neurochrome, the complete goes INSIDE the actions object
[02:38:29] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, lol... my word, you can tell I've still got a lot to learn!
[02:38:34] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, cheers
[02:38:37] <neurochrome> works a treat
[02:39:18] <Whirl3d> you're doing fine. You may need to supply a width in your css before you animate it.
[02:40:01] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, yeah I have done.  Was bashing my head trying to work out why the hover actions were firing multiple times yesterday, turns out the queue action resolved it, still not sure why
[02:40:49] <neurochrome> really appreciate the help btw
[02:41:34] <Whirl3d> np.
[02:41:46] <Whirl3d> I would seriously consider not using .hover...I personally hate the shortcut.
[02:42:20] <Whirl3d> you could more easily use mouseenter, mouseleave and then you would be sure to get the effect you want. I find that sometimes hover doesn't toggle right for some reason
[02:43:53] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, weird, I began with mouseover, mouseout, but couldn't get it to play nicely... I find there are quirks to understanding how jquery interacts with elements!
[02:44:25] <neurochrome> I'm guessing there is some difference between mouseover/enter mouseout/leave
[02:49:30] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, thanks again! GTG and decorate the babies room.. peace out!
[02:49:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/10/
[02:49:59] <Whirl3d> Did I get ya?
[02:50:05] <neurochrome> yep!
[02:50:27] <neurochrome> just taking a look
[02:50:56] <Whirl3d> Try that. It's a little different. Still uses hover, but encapsulates the pieces. Plus it puts a delay in for hiding so it does jump back and forth. Keep a link to that fiddle and check it out later if you gotta run.
[02:50:59] <nisseni> I'm using .dialog, within the dialog I want to use another javascript - this doesn't seem to load, what might be wrong?
[02:51:26] <Whirl3d> nisseni, please create a fiddle at jsfiddle.net with your code so we can look at it.
[02:52:06] <neurochrome> Whirl3d, cheers, it doesn't seem to want to fire after I've activated it once already though, is it supposed to?
[02:52:47] <nisseni> Whirl3d: it's kinda hard since it's an ajax form that loads another page within an iframe
[02:52:58] <xinming> Whirl3d: Is it possible to bind each form a event so that they are handled separately?
[02:53:16] <xinming> Just now I tried with the submit button, It seems it also calls the same count as form count.
[02:55:12] <nisseni> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/L7Ug2/ - but is the script supposed to load?
[02:56:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/15/
[02:57:08] <Whirl3d> nisseni, you can't load a script into an iframe if its another domain
[02:57:12] <Whirl3d> ? sop
[02:57:12] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[02:57:32] <nisseni> Whirl3d: it's not another domain, and I think the iframe is only used for uploading the file
[02:58:14] <neurochrome> in a bit peeps
[02:59:30] <Whirl3d> xinming, sure. In your on statement on the form, just do $(form).on("submit", function (e) { var targ=$(e.target);
[02:59:41] <Whirl3d> targ will be the element requesting teh submit
[03:00:23] <Whirl3d> nisseni, I'd have to soo your code to have any idea and then to be honest, Im not the best with iframes. I have never used one before...
[03:01:28] <nisseni> Whirl3d: but if we put it like this instead, if I load a file into a div with .click, should that div automatically be able to use the javascripts already loaded, or do I have to reload the scripts I will be using somehow?
[03:02:57] <Whirl3d> technically (with the exception of iframe content) it should be able to access the current loaded scripts
[03:03:35] <Whirl3d> iframes are unique in that they are their entire own bubble. you'll have to make sure your scripts are loaded separately and that I don't know how to do.
[03:04:34] <xinming> Whirl3d: So, I have to decide wether to return early in my code , right?
[03:04:54] <nisseni> Whirl3d: but atleast according to the source it isn't in an iframe
[03:05:50] <xinming> It strange.
[03:06:20] <Whirl3d> xingming, if you post your code to jsfiddle.net, I'll check it out and have a better idea what you are asking.
[03:06:22] <xinming> It's strange, I tried to update the script on http://jsfiddle.net/tmsnv/16/, It worked fine. But not the one I use on my site.
[03:06:35] <xinming> Whirl3d: Thanks, I'm trying. :-)
[03:06:59] <Whirl3d> that's one of the best parts of jsfiddle...if it works there it should work on  your site...
[03:07:12] <Whirl3d> xinming, you are doing great...no worries.
[03:09:31] <Whirl3d> xinming, http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/17/
[03:10:47] <Whirl3d> woops, try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/18/
[03:11:41] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/19/ uses the submit event instead
[03:13:54] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/21/   this shows you how the submit event can be called by an outside element...causing an error if you just handle the click event on the submit buttons.
[03:13:57] <xinming> Whirl3d: Thanks, I'll find where my problem is.
[03:14:09] <xinming> THanks for your really good example. :-)
[03:14:22] <Whirl3d> so change "click" to "submit" like http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/tmsnv/20/ and it works regardless of how you try to submit
[03:14:28] <Whirl3d> np
[03:15:53] <xinming> Whirl3d: I think I found my problem now.
[03:16:01] <xinming> I write the event handler within a form loop.
[03:16:19] <xinming> So, It got events bind multiple problems. That's the reason why I always fail.
[03:16:24] <xinming> Whirl3d: Thanks for your time really.
[03:16:34] <Whirl3d> np
[03:21:14] <Austin> I have an ajax based page that queries an xml document for updating a table.
[03:22:34] <Austin> On the initial load I would prefer to feed the table directly, to avoid the double latency of 2 seperate requests
[03:23:23] <Austin> but I would like to utilize the same ajax code that processes the xml feed, are there common ways of doing that?
[03:29:46] <Whirl3d> Austin, you are gonna have to post your code to jsfiddle to get any help most likely. Don't worry about the ajax returns, just put both the html and the js and post the link here.
[03:39:44] <fourlastor> hello everyone :)
[03:44:36] <fourlastor> i was thinking about the structure of a possible game engine, implemented as a jquery pluging, specifically how to instantiate it: since the "playground" can't be any tag, but has to be a div (or a span, but i see the div better), would it be better to run it and internally instantiate the element, giving the user the possibility to append() the game element to whatever element he wants?
[03:46:03] <Whirl3d> Why would you want to make a plugin for that?
[03:46:20] <martisj> if first-child faster than children('.aoisjfoas') ?
[03:46:28] <martisj> i assume so when there is only on child?
[03:46:44] <martisj> one
[03:46:57] <fourlastor> Whirl3d, i was inspired by gameQuery, i like the idea behind it (the playground, different layers etc) but i don't like some pieces of implementation
[03:50:18] <Whirl3d> looks cute though I haven't looked at the code, so I can't really give you any help.
[03:51:07] <xinming> Whirl3d: when we do post, Is there a shortcut for us to get all submit values in form before submit?
[03:51:33] <xinming> I don't wish to do something like,  $(form).find('blabla').attr('value')  <--- Seems to be tedious
[03:51:45] <martisj> can i use first-child on $(this)>
[03:51:46] <martisj> ?
[03:52:38] <Whirl3d> xinming, yes, but I can't recall it right off. look in the api, i'm sure it's there...
[03:52:46] <xinming> Whirl3d: Thanks
[04:02:29] <xinming> Whirl3d: It's called serializeArray() => to object, and serialize() => to string.
[04:04:47] <Whirl3d> right on thanks. it was just on the tip of my tongue...I usually just use the ajaxForm plugin...
[04:07:33] <mason-l> Hello #jQuery, I've got a list of items which I need to order which looks like this http://i.imgur.com/EZDki.png is there any easy way to do that with the stock jQuery API?
[04:09:25] <mason-l> (sorted by the `created="<unixtime>"` attr)
[04:19:29] <diverdude> is there some event that fires on a contentEditable="true" div for whenever a user inputs a value to the div. Basically like the input event for form-elements?
[04:30:32] <dipser> why is console empty? http://jsfiddle.net/dipser/8HtB3/
[04:32:08] <dipser> it doesnt see <ol>

[04:51:47] <dabear> dipser: PEBKAC issue you have there
[04:52:09] <dabear> there is no ol under the ol
[04:52:57] <dabear> which is what that code would look for
[04:54:53] <dipser> ok then
[05:13:51] <pneftali> guys - in the ajax success callback, i'm creating a list that contains images and descriptions and inserting it to a div. what i want is to show the list once all the images are done loading. how do I check this in jquery ?
[05:23:49] <zamba> where's the javascript console in firefox gone to?
[05:24:06] <zamba> inspect element now just gives me a stupid-looking thing with no features

[05:48:15] <_helpPlz_> hey does anybody know if its possible to use .selectable() and force it to select only 1 element at a time?
[05:50:24] <Onkeltem> Hi all. How can I add a method to an object to call it in this way: $el = $('selector'); $el['my_method'].apply($el) ?
[05:52:01] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, i don't get it? .. plz explain more
[05:52:48] <chineseboy> ciao
[05:52:51] <chineseboy> !list
[05:53:29] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: I want to add a method to a set of objects.
[05:53:47] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, use el.each() ?
[05:54:20] <_helpPlz_> not sure if $el.prop('methodname', method) would work though :P
[05:57:44] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: I'm stuck,,
[05:58:47] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, you want to attach a method right? use this $el.prop('<name of method you want here>', <method here>);
[05:59:06] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: let me try
[06:02:20] <diverdude> if i do $('element').live(...).append(...).live(...) will both the live() event handlers be attached to $('element') then?
[06:02:47] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: darn, I have no .prop, it is 1.5.2 :(
[06:03:38] <diverdude> ??
[06:05:35] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, my doubt was right anyway lol if you call prop() it won't work ..
[06:06:03] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: I need somehow to do this, to get called somehow
[06:06:08] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, just use  $el.each();
[06:06:51] <diverdude> if i do $('element').live(...).append(...).live(...) will both the live() event handlers be attached to $('element') then?
[06:09:04] <_helpPlz_> diverdude, i think live() is deprecated and on('mymethod') .. ele.trigger('mymethod') would trigger all attached methods to element
[06:09:08] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: but I can't pass my functional code to it, it is called from Drupal's ajax.js like: $element[response.method].apply($element, response.arguments);
[06:09:48] <_helpPlz_> aha Onkeltem  you can also use .bind() ? and later .trigger() ?
[06:09:56] <diverdude> _helpPlz_: yeah ok...on then...but the main point is, will they both affect the element in the beginning of the chain?
[06:10:23] <_helpPlz_> diverdude, will both the live() event handlers be attached to $('element') then? yes
[06:10:48] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: heh, so this response.method would be 'trigger' with my custom event? :)
[06:18:49] <_helpPlz_> Onkeltem, http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-handler-attachment/ .. i think you should be able to use these [.live() or .bind()] & call .trigger()
[06:26:32] <crazydiamond> Hi. How do I register onclick only on specific element itself, not on it's children?
[06:43:02] <sacho> select the specific element
[06:43:07] <sacho> oh
[06:43:25] <sacho> check event.target
[06:48:17] <Onkeltem> _helpPlz_: thank you very much, I think I got success with .trigger/.bind, not setting them up
[07:11:58] <rotham> hey.. anyone familiar with the datatables plugin?  I am trying to sort a column with slightly odd values.. I took a column of dates and formatted it as xD xH or xH xM depending on how many days/hours/minutes were left until the given datetime, and I'm having a hard time figuring out how to sort it
[07:42:54] <nisseni> I'm using ajaxForm in a .dialog. This ajaxForm is uploading an image which then should be cropped, however, it doesn't seem to be able to load the javascript for the cropping afterwords, any ideas?
[08:02:22] <bardzusny> hey #jquery
[08:02:51] <bardzusny> and it's glorious inhabitants
[08:12:45] <nisseni> when I get Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined - that means jQuery isn't loaded, correct?
[08:13:38] <starsinmypockets> Ugh are jquery datePicker plugin and Jquery UI datepicker plugin different things?
[08:13:43] <_helpPlz_> or, conflict?
[08:14:38] <_helpPlz_> nisseni, http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[08:14:42] <bardzusny> I need magic pill for debugging jquery on internet explorer 7.
[08:14:59] <bardzusny> For some reason my script doesn't execute in it, at all. Other browsers are perfectly fine.
[08:15:01] <_helpPlz_> lol
[08:15:22] <nisseni> _helpPlz_: not using any other, so can't be that
[08:15:25] <alphastory> nisseni: if you've got the query reference in your file and your using an external JS file, its possible that you've called the JS file before the library
[08:15:47] <_helpPlz_> bardzusny, send me script.. i won't copy it :P
[08:15:48] <bardzusny> and with no proper firebug/similar...I don't know what to look for.
[08:16:00] <bardzusny> it's messy, of course
[08:16:20] <bardzusny> sure, wait a sec
[08:16:51] <_helpPlz_> bardzusny, btw, IE9 has option to go into compatibility mode and ie7 in developer tools
[08:17:21] <alphastory> Nisseni: sorry same answer
[08:17:50] <bardzusny> IE9, the one that doesn't work in XP?
[08:17:56] <_helpPlz_> ya
[08:18:11] <bardzusny> well...you just got answer why I can't use it :p
[08:18:38] <_helpPlz_> just checked virtual box with xp, ie8 too has that option
[08:19:38] <crazydiamond> Hi. How do I register onclick event on element, but not on it's children?
[08:20:29] <bardzusny> _helpPlz_: and it has js debugger?
[08:21:34] <_helpPlz_> bardzusny, yes ie8 has but not that net tab (ajax calls etc)
[08:34:15] <nisseni> I'm using ajaxForm in a .dialog. This ajaxForm is uploading an image which then should be cropped, however, it doesn't seem to be able to load the javascript for the cropping afterwords, any ideas?

[08:50:33] <gianbalex> starsinmypockets, jQuery("#event_start_time_am_pm_am).is(":checked") // return True if is checked
[08:51:18] <starsinmypockets> gianbalex - thanks! I also found this $('input[name=event_start_time_am_pm]:checked').val() which returns the checked value from the radio set

[09:50:22] <lenswipe> hey guys
[09:56:49] <crazydiamond> Hi. How do I register onclick event on element, but not on it's children?
[10:11:41] <jwg2s> anyone every implemented pjax? i can't get this shit to work for the life of me
[10:12:17] <systemfault> What's that?
[10:13:02] <systemfault> Ah.. another bullshit acronym..
[10:14:23] <jwg2s> https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[10:14:28] <jwg2s> prevents full page reloads
[10:14:46] <jwg2s> just want to replace content in #content div
[10:17:08] <systemfault> And what do you currently have?
[10:26:40] <christo_m> hello, im trying to do an ajax request for json data, and im getting "invalid label" errors, when i check the Net tab of firebug and look at the request it has content type application/json, so i think its in the right format..
[10:27:19] <christo_m> i literally did render :json => @results , so unless RoR is not rendering the layout properly... im not sure why id be getting this
[10:38:26] <neurochrome> hey folks!
[10:39:34] <neurochrome> just trying to find a site that has some really sweet transition animations for an image gallery (fade and shift, etc).  It stand out because the images are all of ridiculously hot chicks... can't find a link, anyone know the one I'm on about?! =)
[10:43:18] <Lyfesaver> hey guys. I am trying to get the lazyload plugin (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload) to work inside a scrollbar plugin (http://www.baijs.nl/tinyscrollbar/) here: http://jsfiddle.net/PmWCX/
[10:43:26] <Lyfesaver> the problem i am running into is
[10:43:41] <Lyfesaver> that the lazyload plugin uses the scroll event to lad the images
[10:44:12] <Lyfesaver> but once inside the tinyscrollbar (or any of the other 4 scrollbar plugins I have tried) all scrolling is done by the JS code
[10:44:15] <Lyfesaver> not html
[10:44:31] <Lyfesaver> and the divs do not use overflow: scroll, overflow: hidden instead
[10:44:50] <Lyfesaver> so it all boils down tot he event
[10:45:13] <Lyfesaver> any help would be greatly appreciated =) much thx
[10:48:27] <imsky> oh what a saturday
[10:48:49] <vespa-koen> Hey guys, im having a lot of animations, page loading etc that is passed around with callbacks, i really dont like since it is hard for others to understand whats going on, I am thinking about making some kind of global  object, for instance: "EventQueue", ill just add all the functions that have to be executed to it, and when the "Event" is done, it will not call the next callback that is passed into it, but call EventQueue.next() or
[10:48:50] <vespa-koen> something
[10:48:59] <vespa-koen> does it sound like a good idea or is this a no-no ?
[10:49:27] <imsky> go for it
[10:50:07] <vespa-koen> so you think this will work?
[10:50:17] <vespa-koen> guess so, hehe
[10:50:30] <vespa-koen> ah allright, ill just see for myself i guess..
[10:51:17] <imsky> i have 200% faith in you
[10:51:57] <vespa-koen> lol
[10:52:33] <systemfault> 200% of 0… :/
[11:06:59] <hye> hi
[11:08:26] * tw2113 gives hye his seat
[11:08:30] <hye> anyone recommend a good Modal Box Type plugin for pop-up content?  That is rather flexible and very cross browser friendly?  I have tried thickbox, but not very flexible or friendly I think
[11:08:42] <hye> thanks tw2113
[11:09:02] <Lyfesaver> hye jQuery UI has nice dialog pop up that can be modal if u want
[11:09:21] <hye> looking into it now
[11:09:50] <Lyfesaver> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal
[11:10:11] <systemfault> hye: The best I've seen is fancybox… you have to pay for it if you use it for commercial websites IIRC.
[11:10:16] <systemfault> *fancybox2
[11:10:26] <tw2113> at least the latest versions
[11:10:32] <hye> I have played with fancy box
[11:10:48] <hye> Lyfesaver my modal box will have scroll bars, long content, I wonder how jquery ui dialog can handle that, will run a test code
[11:11:03] <tw2113> if you stick with 1.3.4 i think you can still do whatever wth it systemfault
[11:11:03] <Lyfesaver> it is fine i am doing the same thing on my site
[11:11:15] <Lyfesaver> different sections each ith their own scroller
[11:11:19] <systemfault> tw2113: Ah ok
[11:11:36] <Lyfesaver> would anyone mind scrolling back.. and checking out my issue?
[11:11:41] <tw2113> that's my take at least, and what i do :D
[11:11:44] <Lyfesaver> i have been struglling with it for two days
[11:11:57] <Lyfesaver> currently it is the bane of my existence
[11:12:00] <Lyfesaver> =)
[11:12:28] <systemfault> I would help but I don't know these plugins..
[11:12:39] <Lyfesaver> hmmm
[11:13:50] <hye> looks like jquery ui dialog is not very friendly with iframes
[11:14:04] <hye> fancy box is more friendlier with iframes
[11:14:07] <Lyfesaver> kk
[11:14:20] <systemfault> Like everything in jQuery UI.. if you don't like the defaults, you're f.
[11:14:34] <hye> you're f?
[11:14:38] <imsky> write your own everything!
[11:14:58] <systemfault> hye: vulgar word starting with f and ending with ucked
[11:16:23] * Lyfesaver bangs his head on the desk..... repeatedly
[11:17:08] <imsky> whip it good
[11:23:17] <granden> Is there any way to catch a swipe event, specificly from right to left?
[11:24:08] <justinbmeyer> granden: jQuery Mobile has one, so does jquerypp.com
[11:27:03] <kryl> I load html from ajax into a div, and css class doesn't apply with FF only is it normal ?
[11:28:03] <kryl> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4308924/firefox-wont-render-css-styles-on-content-loaded-with-jquery-ajax < like this :)
[11:40:29] <granden> history.back() is that a jquery mobile thing or does it work with jquery as well?
[12:15:20] <shoky> granden it's a javascript/DOM thing
[12:17:08] <granden> shoky: Ok, nice. So it will work with only js as well then.
[12:17:37] <shoky> oh hmm not on IE<10 tho :\
[12:17:48] <shoky> ah nm
[12:30:55] <Lyfesaver> i feel like finding the nearest projectile weapon and shooting myself, i cant believe this is this hard
[12:32:51] <ragnok> what is so hard <Lyfesaver> ?
[12:33:13] <Lyfesaver> cross plugin issues =(
[12:33:33] <ragnok> mm
[12:33:36] <Lyfesaver> http://jsfiddle.net/PmWCX/
[12:33:37] <ragnok> how many?
[12:33:40] <Lyfesaver> 2
[12:33:44] <Lyfesaver> only using two
[12:33:50] <Lyfesaver> i know where the issue lies
[12:34:04] <Lyfesaver> the lazyload plugin works from a default "scoll" even
[12:34:13] <Lyfesaver> when the div has overflow:scroll
[12:34:20] <Lyfesaver> but when using the tinyscrollbar
[12:34:25] <Lyfesaver> or ANY scrollbar plugin
[12:34:41] <Lyfesaver> they keep divs overflow hidden and keep scrolling within the JS plugin
[12:34:44] <Lyfesaver> so it is simple
[12:34:54] <Lyfesaver> the scroll event never gets activated for the lazyload plugin
[12:35:04] <Lyfesaver> its easy to detect, but to debug
[12:35:10] <Lyfesaver> but not* to
[12:40:19] <rychiss> i have tried to use the "attr " to add an attribute to all of the divs titled "wrap", however it only adds the attribute to the first div that is called wrap. What am I doing wrong?
[12:41:57] <ragnok> <Lyfesaver>, i guess you sholud be using something else, uselles to try to debug if you don't know how
[12:44:31] <Lyfesaver> well, i wont give up.. i have spent the past 3 days working on this... posting on the devs sites asking for insight into the issue, asking firends.... so I am not going to give up yet... I know how to debug.. it is what I ahve been doing the past 3 days.. I am just no good at it =) but tyvm bro =) i appreciate u looking at it and giving it a shot  =)
[12:49:10] <shoky> i'll give it a shot ;p
[12:49:25] <Lyfesaver> for real? AWESOME!
[12:49:35] <Lyfesaver> (i hope u were talkign to me)
[12:49:37] <Lyfesaver> lol
[12:49:38] <Lyfesaver> =)
[12:49:40] <shoky> yea u ;p
[12:49:44] <Lyfesaver> awesome
[12:49:47] <Lyfesaver> tyvm shoky
[12:56:12] <rychiss> Can someone help me out?
[12:56:30] <Lyfesaver> state your issue, share some links.....
[12:56:34] <Lyfesaver> and we will see if we can
[12:56:54] <rychiss> great. few moments.
[13:02:51] <rychiss> Lyfesaver - here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/7zAL9/
[13:04:18] <rychiss> I want to make each div with the id: wrap clickable. I want jquery to use the url that is in the href of that div
[13:04:51] <Lyfesaver> well the first issue I am seeing... unless things have changed in the game, is your HTML code
[13:05:06] <Lyfesaver> oh no
[13:05:10] <Lyfesaver> i see what u did
[13:05:48] <Lyfesaver> well
[13:05:52] <Lyfesaver> first off
[13:06:03] <Lyfesaver> u need to not use id="wrap" if u have more than one
[13:06:11] <Lyfesaver> u want to use class="wrap"
[13:06:42] <rychiss> well let me explain more.. the html that is presented there is generated by this plugin
[13:06:52] <Lyfesaver> ohhhh
[13:07:08] <rychiss> I am trying to modify it so I can link to a page
[13:07:17] <Lyfesaver> what plugin?
[13:07:41] <rychiss> Cloud Zoom - http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom-integration.htm
[13:08:31] <rychiss> I have a feeling I may not have approached my goal in the easiest manner
[13:09:03] <Lyfesaver> no
[13:09:04] <Lyfesaver> sec
[13:09:08] <Lyfesaver> i am tryign something
[13:09:13] <rychiss> cool
[13:09:20] <smokingastromonk> I am trying to include some math typography in a site and though MathML would work fine, but browser support just isn't there. I tried searching for jquery plugins that do the same, but keep getting tutorials on javascript arithmetic.  Anyone know if anyone created a math quote plugin?
[13:10:16] <xmaddness> smokingastromonk: I think you are looking for a LaTeX plugin for jquery
[13:10:20] <xmaddness> there are some that exist
[13:10:40] <smokingastromonk> xmaddness:  Oooh there is?!
[13:10:43] <xmaddness> like jsLaTeX
[13:11:03] <smokingastromonk> Latex is simple as hell to use. Should have thought of that!!
[13:11:04] <xmaddness> I can't vouge for how well tey work
[13:11:06] <xmaddness> but its a start
[13:11:25] <smokingastromonk> xmaddness:  Doesn't hurt to try it out and find out :D  I'll let you know how it goes
[13:11:29] <xmaddness> kk
[13:11:30] <xmaddness> gl
[13:11:34] <smokingastromonk> Thanks
[13:11:56] <shoky> Lyfesaver: sori, didn't find a simple way to hack it
[13:12:04] <xmaddness> smokingastromonk, http://blog.dreasgrech.com/2009/12/jslatex-jquery-plugin-to-directly-embed.html
[13:12:04] <Lyfesaver> *sigh*
[13:12:06] <Lyfesaver> kk bro
[13:12:07] <Lyfesaver> thx
[13:12:14] <smokingastromonk> xmaddness: beat you to it :P
[13:12:23] <bardzusny> rychiss: are you sure you want to call .click on divs, not "a" elements?
[13:12:29] <bardzusny> http://jsfiddle.net/7zAL9/1/
[13:12:36] <bardzusny> but this gets href of first "a" element
[13:12:42] <smokingastromonk> xmaddness:  The demos are beautiful http://dreasgrech.com/upload/jslatex/demos.html
[13:13:28] <xmaddness> yeah looks like it may work for you
[13:14:37] <rychiss> badzusny - yes I want it to click on the div. My goal is for it to read the href from the <a> of each "wrap" div and use that url
[13:15:55] <rychiss> badzusny - need to get href from each #wrap
[13:16:04] <Lyfesaver> rychiss, if u give your div a data tag or whatever, and give the data the url u want
[13:16:19] <Lyfesaver> then each div can have its own url
[13:16:44] <Lyfesaver> http://paste2.org/p/2049619
[13:16:57] <Lyfesaver> then that code should work
[13:17:04] <Lyfesaver> so it would be
[13:17:36] <Lyfesaver> <div id="Wrap" data="htp://www.google.com" style="... ...
[13:17:40] <Lyfesaver> and so on
[13:18:04] <Lyfesaver> but once again
[13:18:09] <Lyfesaver> i would switch from id to class
[13:18:23] <smokingastromonk> xmaddness:  Works perfectly!  So simple!
[13:18:23] <rychiss> the issue is that those tags are generated from this plugin
[13:18:29] <Lyfesaver> ya i know
[13:18:31] <Lyfesaver> it uscks
[13:18:33] <xmaddness> smokingastromonk: sweet
[13:18:38] <rychiss> pretty much
[13:18:38] <Lyfesaver> i dont know how to fix that
[13:19:04] * smokingastromonk highfives xmaddness
[13:19:08] <Lyfesaver> again, shoky... tyvm for looking at my issue =) i only wish u had an answer for me bro =( but pleas.. thanks for looking
[13:20:40] <rychiss> would you know why my code only applies to the first div?
[13:20:48] <rychiss> lyfesaver
[13:20:57] <Lyfesaver> my guess
[13:21:05] <Lyfesaver> because u are using id and nto class
[13:21:09] <Lyfesaver> i am telling u
[13:21:16] <Lyfesaver> it is a major thing
[13:52:40] <shoky> Lyfesaver i got someth rly hacky that sorta kinda works :P
[13:52:50] <Lyfesaver> awesome!
[13:52:54] <Lyfesaver> i am all for it =)
[13:53:01] <shoky> but it pretty much does the lazy loading by itself heh ;S
[13:53:05] <shoky> sec ill fix it up a bit
[13:53:08] <Lyfesaver> kk
[13:53:09] <Lyfesaver> ty
[14:05:20] <shoky> Lyfesaver: http://jsfiddle.net/PmWCX/3/    (currently i set the interval for 1 second so you can easily see it working)
[14:05:55] <Lyfesaver> yes it works great!
[14:06:08] <shoky> and that '500'  is the "sensitivity"
[14:06:25] <Lyfesaver> ya
[14:06:37] <Lyfesaver> i see your work
[14:06:43] <Lyfesaver> i would not call that hacky
[14:06:45] <Lyfesaver> not at all
[14:07:50] <shoky> welp, whatever works ;P
[14:09:06] <Lyfesaver> shoky, thanks again.... really I mean it. You have NO idea how much I appreciate this. I know you have no idea, cuz I hav no way of expressing how evil this has been to me
[14:09:45] <Lyfesaver> so thx a lot bro =) really
[14:09:58] <shoky> yer welcome ;p hope you can make it work good on your site
[14:10:23] <Lyfesaver> I am 99.9% sure and wil report back to you good news soon =)
[14:11:49] <shoky> ;]
[14:16:49] <mdunham918_> hello everyone I have built a custom image slider http://www.straightlineag.com.php5-3.dfw1-1.websitetestlink.com/new_index.php that features a text overlay. I want to add a transition to my slider though. I don't want to use a huge slideshow plugin I simply want to be able to call a function like $(nextImage).pixelBurst();
[14:17:17] <mdunham918_> i want to build a transition like the one featured in the very top photo http://indeziner.com/development/15-jquery-transition-effects/
[14:19:48] <mdunham918_> nevrmind i guess i can just hack nivo slider
[14:28:49] <Neddard> Good evening, I am having some troubles with an "Infinite-scrolling" script i found. I've got it all to work except being able to send the value of a specific element (to run a PHP script). In the script (http://jsfiddle.net/ZkVYf/1/) 'contentData' is supposed to keep track of the values I want but I can't get it to work, I just don't know how the developer intended it to function. I've tried
[14:28:49] <Neddard> to find documentation but there is none.  I've been sitting with this all day to figure out what is wrong but I simply can't, any help at all would be very much appreciated.
[14:29:49] <mrbrdo> can anyone recommend a good Ellipsis plugin? I am using dotdotdot at the moment but it's bugged if the user uses zoom (ctrl +/-)
[15:01:47] <Blaster> hi is there a way to prevent $.get from caching in IE?
[15:03:19] <imsky> yes
[15:03:51] <Blaster> I know you can pass a unique number on the end of each string but I'd prefer a way I can do it for all my requests without altering the code
[15:04:11] <imsky> $.ajax("url", {cache:false})
[15:04:39] <Blaster> But I'd have to do that on each call, right?
[15:04:46] <Blaster> What about keeping $.get and using $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });
[15:04:56] <imsky> sure why not
[15:11:59] <Lyfesaver> shoky, works great bro =) good job =)
[15:13:03] <Lyfesaver> i might have spoke too soon
[15:13:40] <Lyfesaver> for some reason, it is loading all images without scrolling
[15:13:52] <Lyfesaver> but it is doing it very nice and neatlyin the background
[15:14:07] <Lyfesaver> not making the client wait while it loads
[15:15:00] <shoky> ;P
[15:15:08] <Lyfesaver> its not bad
[15:15:15] <Lyfesaver> i mean it frees up the client
[15:15:23] <Lyfesaver> =)
[15:40:23] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i'm new to jquery...what does this mean: updateCal_ajax_req.fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {.....
[15:46:50] <shoky> Krambiorix: probably updateCal_ajax_req is a variable that was set to the returned value from $.ajax or one of its shortcuts, and the .fail(...) is the way to set an error handler for the ajax request
[15:50:04] <Krambiorix> shoky, thx, the errorThrows = SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data ... There is no whitespace after it
[15:51:11] <shoky> the ajax response is probably invalid JSON ..
[15:55:38] <psyolus> If you have multiple objects that need to do something on an event, is it better to bind multiple times (once per object) or only bind once and delegate?
[15:56:14] <shoky> objects?
[15:57:26] <psyolus> Yes. Objects.
[15:57:57] <shoky> can you give a simple example?
[15:58:33] <marcamilly> anyone encountered this problem before: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10943365/navigation-broken-the-menu-link-home-points-to-a-nonexistent-id-home-jav ?
[16:00:15] <Krambiorix> shoky, i validated the json response on jsonlint.com
[16:00:54] <shoky> Krambiorix: show some code..
[16:01:28] <marcamilly> or if you've never encountered this, how do I debug this so that I can get to the bottom of the problem? I looked on my JS console and I don't see any errors or anything like that being generated
[16:01:32] <Krambiorix> shoky, http://pastebin.com/itHdvDgs
[16:01:43] <psyolus> You have three objects. Each objects does something on the event "doSomething." One of them changes colors, one changes position, and the last changes size. Each object could individually bind to the event or there could just be one bind that delegates for the three.
[16:01:46] <shoky> async:false? seriously?
[16:03:00] <Krambiorix> shoky, it doesn't make a difference
[16:03:09] <shoky> Krambiorix:  the response needs to be a JSON object, not an array, btw.
[16:03:21] <Krambiorix> shoky, i still get the error JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data
[16:03:39] <Krambiorix> shoky, it is a JSON object ( json string coming from PHP)
[16:03:51] <shoky> can you paste that too
[16:05:04] <Krambiorix> shoky, http://pastebin.com/9casg3a9
[16:05:34] <shoky> i assume that 2 is not part of the response..?
[16:06:01] <Krambiorix> shoky, i see that in firebug
[16:06:13] <Krambiorix> shoky, in php when creating the response , it's not there
[16:06:52] <shoky> ok so you DIDNT validate the response on jsonlint.com :\
[16:06:56] <systemfault> ...
[16:07:41] <Krambiorix> shoky, i thought the number was added by firebug so i removed it on jsonlint.com
[16:07:50] <shoky> Krambiorix: the bottom line is: when you ask for help, it helps that the people helping you are not blind to what you're actually doing, and that is all up to you
[16:08:04] <Krambiorix> shoky, ok sorry
[16:08:20] <shoky> no problem ;]
[16:09:08] <marcamilly> no thoughts on my issue?
[16:09:28] <Krambiorix> shoky, what can i do? :s
[16:09:45] <shoky> Krambiorix: figure out where that 2 is coming from... most likely inside your php
[16:11:14] <shoky> psyolus: ok so those are not objects, they are DOM elements
[16:12:04] <shoky> marcamilly: same thoughts as the guy who commented there
[16:13:43] <marcamilly> shoky: how do I figure out what the background js being fired is? When I push this to a public server it doesn't throw this error
[16:13:56] <marcamilly> and I don't know what to jsfiddle
[16:13:57] <shoky> psyolus: there's no "better" approach here, it depends on how you wanna structure your code
[16:14:06] <psyolus> That
[16:14:07] <psyolus> s
[16:14:11] <psyolus> That's what I was thinking.
[16:15:11] <shoky> psyolus: but having multiple observers/listeners is usually not a bad thing..
[16:16:27] <shoky> unless you have tons of shit with lots of twisted dependency chains ;SSS
[16:16:51] <shoky> and if you do then you should use knockout.js ;D
[16:17:12] <shoky> psyolus: use knockout.js :D
[16:17:18] <Krambiorix> shoky, i have no idea where to search, it's not in my PHP
[16:17:44] <shoky> Krambiorix: umm i have no idea either... i can look at your php too if you want :S
[16:18:06] <Krambiorix> shoky, i outputted the response but there is no 2
[16:19:34] <shoky> adunno...
[16:25:42] <Krambiorix> damn what a stupid problem
[16:26:52] <noobie25> i'm having trouble posting my for using ajax.  It is refreshing to a new page, when it shouldn't.  i tired immediately calling event.preventDefault() but not working.
[16:27:24] <systemfault> hmm, weird
[16:27:27] <Krambiorix> this 2 is killing me
[16:46:23] <Krambiorix> shoky : i got it!!!! an echo in a library!
[16:48:25] <kinesis> oh i get it
[16:58:50] <shoky> Krambiorix: yep ;p
[17:09:09] <jahc> I need a bit of jquery that will scan a div and give me the first element that has an id .. an id that isnt blank or non existant
[17:10:19] <systemfault> :/
[17:10:36] <systemfault> I don't think you can have an empty id...
[17:10:40] <systemfault> But..
[17:10:54] <systemfault> $('[id]') :/
[17:11:00] <systemfault> hmm
[17:11:05] <systemfault> .first()
[17:11:14] <jahc> ta for ideas.. will give it a go. :)
[17:11:15] <draginx> Is there anyway to get the file name of a input[file] on change? Or a quick and dirty way of starting the upload on change (using ajax) and not use https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload ?
[17:12:02] <systemfault> draginx: You cannot send files with ajax on a lot of browsers
[17:12:10] <draginx> :/
[17:12:17] <draginx> so i have to use iframe?
[17:12:43] <systemfault> That's what jQuery file Upload does when it detects that a browser cannot use ajax file uploads
[17:13:27] <draginx> :/ k
[17:13:34] <systemfault> It sucks … I know
[17:16:39] <vespakoen> hey guys, how would i hide all the "first level" children of an element
[17:17:57] <tdskate> vespakoen: $('element > *').hide() ?
[17:18:10] <jahc> hmm.. $('*').children().first().hide() ?? hmm, guessing :)
[17:18:10] <jahc> I suck
[17:18:46] <vespakoen> this did the trick for me $('#content > div').hide()
[17:19:18] <tdskate> what I said :)
[17:20:54] <jahc> nice one tdskate  :)
[17:21:08] <vespakoen> ah lol, seen it too late, thanks mates!
[17:49:44] <Krambiorix> shoky, sry, forgot, thanks!
[17:59:12] <draginx> http://health.danieldurante.com/?page_id=37 why wont fileupload send to url after change?
[18:34:27] <lenswipe> hey guys
[18:34:29] <lenswipe> anyone around?
[18:37:05] <peepsalot> does anyone use jquery inside of greasemonkey scripts
[18:37:49] <lenswipe> peepsalot, im in here too :p
[18:37:53] <lenswipe> muahahahaha
[18:54:13] <abjorn> asdf
[19:09:54] <innociv> Is there a way to do filter and find at the same time?
[19:10:08] <innociv> In one line
[19:10:32] <innociv> It bothers me how I can't search both the element and it's descendants for a selector match
[19:11:53] <shoky> innociv:  .find(...).andSelf().filter(...)  :\
[19:12:36] <innociv> Well, that's not so bad, is it?  Or is it slow or something?
[19:12:58] <systemfault> It's the DOM.. it's always slow :D
[19:13:41] <innociv> Eh?  I mean, .find() is super fast I thought.
[19:13:55] <shoky> innociv it's not slow but it's doing the filtering twice
[19:14:02] <shoky> once in the find, another in the .filter
[19:14:44] <innociv> Oh it's going to filter on the find as well?
[19:14:56] <systemfault> innociv: If you need to filter, can't you do it at the same time with .find?
[19:14:58] <shoky> find has a selector..
[19:15:05] <innociv> systemfault, that's what I want to do
[19:15:17] <systemfault> innociv: Give us more details
[19:15:38] <innociv> k gimme 30 seconds
[19:15:39] <innociv> I'll jsfiddle
[19:16:44] <shoky> he wants $('<div> <p></p> <div></div> </div>').findWithSelf('div') to return both divs
[19:17:04] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/bxap7/3/ .find() will only select the two divs inside.  I want to also select the cached selector itself if it also matches the find filter
[19:17:06] <innociv> find selector*
[19:17:11] <shoky> but on  <p> <div></div> </p>   to return only the inner div
[19:17:34] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/bxap7/4/ which andSelf().filter() will do.
[19:17:42] <innociv> But isn't that filtering on everything returned by find?
[19:17:57] <shoky> isn't that what you wanted
[19:18:15] <innociv> http://jsfiddle.net/bxap7/5/ this way is terrible maintainability
[19:18:34] <innociv> No. There is no need to filter on everything returned by .find()
[19:18:38] <innociv> Because it's the same selector.
[19:19:38] <shoky> yea that's what i meant when i said it's doing the filtering twice..
[19:20:04] <innociv> Yes, makes sense.  Would be "slow" on big elements.  Or, maybe not slow, but uneconomical.
[19:20:25] <innociv> I really don't understand why jquery doesn't have a function already that does both.  Am I the only person that heavily caches selectors?
[19:20:40] <systemfault> innociv: That's what you should do
[19:20:54] <innociv> The last sentence I said?
[19:21:05] <systemfault> Yeah
[19:21:08] <innociv> That's what I thought.
[19:21:14] <systemfault> You should cache selectors :P
[19:21:53] <innociv> This only becomes an issue when you're caching selectors.  You never run into a case where you need to find find+filter simutaniously when you're doing a $(selector) itself.
[19:27:24] <shoky> innociv:  http://jsfiddle.net/bxap7/8/  :S
[19:28:42] <innociv> aha I was thinking of that.
[19:29:06] <innociv> Thanks. :x
[19:29:39] <systemfault> :P
[19:30:12] <shoky> ;-P~~~
[19:35:10] <innociv> I just sometimes don't want to do those things because "god damn it jquery should have this native"
[19:41:01] <tw2113> "should"
[19:41:47] <systemfault> I think jquery is fat and needs a diet :D
[19:43:19] <tw2113> make a distributed plugin of this functionality
[20:45:58] <Blaster> does anyone know if there's something like $.findById(idStoredInVar);  instead of using $('#+idStoredInVar) ?
[20:47:46] <systemfault> The best part of jquery is the fact that it have a selector engine ...
[20:47:54] <systemfault> Without it.. jQuery would suck.
[20:47:59] <Blaster> oh
[20:48:55] <systemfault> Blaster: usually, if you need to play with strings to create your selector.. you have a design problem
[20:49:04] <systemfault> (It's not always the case…. but often a sign of it)
[20:49:45] <martisj> mornin
[21:10:20] <Blaster> systemfault:  Can u explain more?
[21:10:41] <Blaster> what if you need to store a database ID in a CSS id?  Is that bad practice?
[21:11:19] <systemfault> Of course it is...
[21:11:47] <Blaster> I thought so, but I don't realize any other way to do it...
[21:12:25] <Blaster> If you use AJAX to make a list of items in a database, and you want to assign click handlers which do more ajax calls based on the original DB item, how do you carry the ID over?
[21:13:01] <systemfault> Blaster: You add a custom attribute on the root element of the object that represent the DB Object.
[21:13:23] <Blaster> I dont understand, can you provide an example?
[21:16:14] <systemfault> Hmm
[21:16:42] <Blaster> do you mean adding an HTML attribute which carries the database ID?
[21:16:57] <Blaster> because thats basically what I'm doing with the ID attribute
[21:17:56] <systemfault> 2 seconds
[21:20:53] <Blaster> Could you explain a little more please??
[21:21:11] <Blaster> If I'm using bad practice I want to know the right way before I keep going ;)
[21:22:31] <dan_> this might get asked a lot, but what's the best online solution for someone who knows javascript to learn jquery?
[21:25:00] <abjorn> well..jquery docs aren't bad
[21:25:16] <systemfault> Blaster: http://jsfiddle.net/PHN8D/
[21:25:17] <abjorn> well, I mean, they're not great, but if you're familliar with javascript it's a matter of learning the api
[21:25:32] <abjorn> or, dan_: http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[21:25:47] <dan_> abjorn: yeah i'm looking at that site right now
[21:25:49] <dan_> it seems pretty good
[21:25:51] <dan_> and it's pretty too
[21:26:04] <abjorn> jqfundamentals is probs the best tut on it
[21:26:20] <Blaster> systemfault: why is it better practice to use a non standards compliant tag when my ID tags are unused?
[21:26:25] <dan_> alright cool thanks
[21:26:35] <Blaster> attribute*
[21:27:04] <systemfault> Blaster: Attributes prefixed with data- are allowed in HTML5
[21:28:04] <systemfault> Blaster: As you can see, I added the attribute on the highest tag that encloses the functionality of the "DB" object
[21:28:05] <Blaster> ah
[21:28:17] <sahbeewah> also, numbers are not valid DOM ids, also, it fills the id namespace making future id selectors slower, and having data-* attributes allows you to access them via jquery using the .data() method
[21:28:32] <systemfault> That way, you can have a many buttons as you want and you will still be able to get the data-id without repetition
[21:28:34] <sahbeewah> so you can use .data('id') instead of .attr('data-id')
[21:28:46] <Blaster> cool
[21:28:56] <Blaster> im using XHTML doctypes though
[21:29:02] <Blaster> so I guess I shouldn't do that?
[21:29:05] <systemfault> You should forget about it.
[21:29:12] <systemfault> XHTML is pretty much dead
[21:30:36] <abjorn> TRU NUFF
[21:31:25] <systemfault> Nobody really used XHTML :P
[21:31:41] <systemfault> Because XHTML is too strict… a single bad character and the whole page doesn't appear
[21:32:05] <systemfault> So even people using XHTML were sending it with type text/html :P
[22:26:37] <ner0x> Anyone familiar with jstree?
[22:29:29] <psyolus> Is there a simple time to extend jQuery.ajax to log start/completion times?
[22:33:37] <ub3rst4r> I am developing a PHP script that uses jQuery. I was wondering if its better to get the jQuery file externally or internally?
[22:35:49] <Blaster> hey guys how would you filter out tr elements that have a colspan attribute?  $('table tr')
[22:37:40] <systemfault> Blaster: $('tr[colspan]')
[22:39:00] <Blaster> i want to count all the tr's that dont have colspans... that doesnt seem right
[22:39:31] <systemfault> That have or don't have?
[22:39:40] <Blaster> that don't have
[22:39:42] <systemfault> Because you said 'have' before
[22:39:47] <Blaster> ahh
[22:39:58] <systemfault> $('tr:not([colspan])') I think
[22:40:03] <Blaster> $('tr[^colspan]') ??
[22:40:12] <systemfault> Nah...
[22:40:19] <systemfault> Mine will probably work though
[22:41:11] <Blaster> its getting the one with the colspan
[22:41:18] <Blaster> as well as those without
[22:41:28] <Blaster> trs dont have colspans anyway, td's do
[22:42:17] <systemfault> Look.. you asked a question :P I tried to answer it :D
[22:42:22] <Blaster> but i want to know how many trs have tds without a colspan
[22:42:26] <systemfault> Ahhh
[22:42:34] <Blaster> lol
[22:42:55] <systemfault> Hmm
[22:43:13] <systemfault> You will probably need to do it in 2 steps
[22:43:24] <Blaster> it has to be a chain
[22:43:58] <systemfault> Hmm
[22:44:08] <Blaster> for fun, that is
[22:44:10] <systemfault> I just saw something that might work
[22:44:13] <Blaster> cause I know its possible
[22:44:52] <systemfault> $('tr:has(td:not([colspan]))') :/ REALLY NOT SURE
[22:45:27] <Blaster> nope
[22:45:35] <Blaster> good try tho:)
[22:47:15] <systemfault> Hmm .filter then
[22:47:46] <Blaster> how?
[22:50:20] <tw2113> voodoo
[22:50:34] <systemfault> $('tr').filter(function() { return $(this).find('td[colspan]').length == 0; }); perhaps
[22:50:55] <Blaster> its not allowed to use a callback
[22:51:02] <systemfault> PFPFFFF
[22:51:18] <Blaster> come on it has to be able to be done with selectors!
[22:51:24] <Blaster> lol
[22:52:04] <Blaster> good function tho
[22:53:50] <systemfault> Like I said… before..
[22:53:51] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/8PUKL/
[22:54:01] <systemfault> Why do you say it doesn't work?
[22:54:06] <systemfault> I was right the first time.
[22:54:48] <Blaster> guess i tested it wrong
[22:54:50] <Blaster> sorry
[22:54:55] <Blaster> nice one!
[22:54:56] <systemfault> <3
[23:11:25] <tmerrill99s> YAR!  Why isn't my selected item getting it's "selected" attr set? http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/34/
[23:12:10] <tmerrill99s> YARR!  Yer all sleepin!!
[23:15:49] <rodd> tmerrill99s that's one spaghetti
[23:15:51] <rodd> code
[23:16:40] <tmerrill99s> rodd, it was a quick copy/paste into jsfiddle.  no reason to be so picky.
[23:16:51] <tmerrill99s> ;-)
[23:17:03] <rodd> either way, whenever I click on an image, an item becomes selected in your select element
[23:17:27] <tmerrill99s> yep.  but why isn't the 'selected' attribute added to the option?
[23:17:35] <tmerrill99s> that's what i need to set.
[23:19:05] <systemfault> probably that .prop('selected', true) would work
[23:19:52] <tmerrill99s> systemfault, i'm using jquery 1.4.4 and i don't think 'prop' works there.  too old.
[23:20:25] <rodd> tmerrill99s your .val after .attr
[23:20:26] <systemfault> Yeah… .prop is 1.6+
[23:20:45] <tmerrill99s> yes, rodd ?
[23:21:23] <tmerrill99s> rodd, did you find a problem?
[23:22:23] <rodd> get rid of .val(hash)
[23:22:39] <tmerrill99s> weird to me that this doesn't work:  $('select').find('option[value=hash]').attr('selected','selected');
[23:23:04] <tmerrill99s> but i've got to match the value from the "hash" var
[23:23:11] <rodd> what about $('select').find('option[value="'+ hash + '"]').attr('selected', true);
[23:24:37] <tmerrill99s> doesn't seem to fly.  i don't see any 'selected' attr getting set.
[23:24:47] <tmerrill99s> are you in the fiddle and that's working?
[23:24:50] <tmerrill99s> rodd?
[23:24:56] <rodd> works for me, hang on
[23:25:25] <systemfault> Try it the hard way :P  $('select').find('option[value="'+ hash + '"]').get(0).selected = true;  :P
[23:25:39] <tmerrill99s> rodd, it's one thing to set it in the 'select' box.  it's another thing to add the 'selected' attribute.  are you don't both of those successfully?
[23:25:53] <tmerrill99s> argh.  'are you doing'
[23:29:50] <tmerrill99s> rodd, if you've got it doing both of those things, feel free to update the fiddle.
[23:30:01] <tmerrill99s> i'm pulling out my hair over here. ;-)
[23:30:31] <gloomer> tmerrill99s whats the fiddle link
[23:31:00] <tmerrill99s> gloomer, http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/34/
[23:36:19] <tmerrill99s> man.....firebug gets wonky on jsfiddle every now and then and I can't see the stuff in the iframe.  only the iframe itself.  what gives?
[23:38:03] <systemfault> Perhaps firefox doesn't support frames… I don't know as I don't use it
[23:38:12] <systemfault> No problem with the chrome dev tools though
[23:38:22] <gloomer> so what problem are you having
[23:38:26] <gloomer> it seems to be working to me
[23:38:33] <gloomer> selecing the select item with the value of the href
[23:38:40] <rodd> tmerrill99s tricky one
[23:38:45] <tmerrill99s> is the actual 'selected' attribute getting set on the correct optioN?
[23:39:18] <tmerrill99s> the select box will indeed reflect the change correctly.  the 'selected' attribute refuses to get set within the dom, however.
[23:39:25] <tmerrill99s> rodd, gloomer
[23:39:29] <tmerrill99s> ^
[23:40:14] <rodd> tmerrill99s we must be missing something, starting from 1.6.4 it works just fine ( http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/36/ )
[23:44:33] <tmerrill99s> awesome.  firefox just bombed......
[23:46:26] <tmerrill99s> rodd, you're right!
[23:46:52] <tmerrill99s> just need to clear the current selected and replace it with the new one (if the user changes his/her mind, of course)
[23:47:18] <rodd> yes
[23:50:56] <tmerrill99s> rodd, i think i got it now:  $("#my-Select").find('option').attr("selected","") ;
[23:51:17] <tmerrill99s> ooops. meant to past this.  jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/37/
[23:51:52] <tmerrill99s> rodd, gloomer , thanks for your help.  you guys should sleep soundly knowing that you helped a brother out tonight.  big thanks!
[23:53:35] <rodd> No prob, could also use: $("select option:selected").removeAttr( 'selected' );
[23:54:45] <gloomer> glad you figured it out
[23:55:04] <gloomer> was not even looking at the version of jquery on left
