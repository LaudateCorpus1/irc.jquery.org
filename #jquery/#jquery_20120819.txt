[00:02:22] <faraway> hi, i cleaning up my js scripts. and now i'm looking at my script for manipulating styleSheets (de/-activating, manipulating the existing rules, removing/adding rules) i there a good cross browser library for this?
[00:02:41] <Lindrian> Can someone help me?
[00:04:30] <coldhead> faraway: you want something like cssQuery
[00:04:38] <coldhead> at least it should have that name
[00:04:59] <coldhead> i haven't ever found a good one
[00:05:01] <zapsoda> :P
[00:05:29] <faraway> coldhead: hehe thats exaclty my problem, i was wonering if i can'T serach right or if there isn'T anyone :D
[00:07:23] <faraway> coldhead: well then i'll clean up my code using parts of jquery to support vendor prefixes and other things and make it a github project
[00:08:06] <coldhead> faraway: most css optimisation is on the server
[00:08:13] <coldhead> less and sass and that kind of thing
[00:08:26] <coldhead> if you can do a good one for the browser i'll be so happy
[00:08:27] <faraway> coldhead: i use sass and compass
[00:12:50] <faraway> coldhead: there are still some cases where it is useful to manipulate the stylesheet directly or to query it directly.
[00:18:28] <Lindrian> God damnit. This is hard.
[00:18:33] <Lindrian> e.stopPropagation(); almost does what I want.
[00:20:44] <Lindrian> How can I do "live" mouseenter/mouseleave?
[00:26:13] <EasyCo> code snippet?
[00:29:05] <taipres> http://pastebin.com/ZRvbHmay how I get the URL?
[00:36:43] <EasyCo> Ar eyou looking for the url of the current window?
[00:37:44] <taipres> no of what was clicked
[00:38:09] <taipres> when mousdown fires for a "a" tag indicated <a href="whatever"
[00:38:48] <EasyCo> alert($(this).prop('href'));
[00:39:04] <taipres> thanks, jquery is a tricky 1 :)
[00:39:13] <EasyCo> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[00:39:25] <EasyCo> Just keep swimming
[00:39:45] <taipres> lol
[00:39:50] <EasyCo> :)
[00:40:01] <taipres> [03:29] <deltab> foo.click(handler) adds a click handler; foo.click() simulates a click event
[00:40:19] <taipres> learned that today ;) learn something everyday I suppose
[00:40:44] <EasyCo> Yep
[00:42:11] <taipres> I probably would of labeled them abit different personally, but sure above is more optimal
[00:42:52] <EasyCo> But then you'd have another function name to remember.
[00:43:14] <EasyCo> http://bit.ly/NOOgd4
[00:46:19] <taipres> I suppose but, foo.clickh() to indicate click handler and foo.click() for normal click makes lot more sense to me
[00:50:19] <coldhead> taipres: lots of functions in jquery do different things depending on what you pass to it
[00:50:23] <guy> I need a script that provides gui to browse json data. probably in a table. anyone can recommend what they know?
[00:50:26] <coldhead> it's a good thing because it's less to remember
[00:50:37] <coldhead> and it's well done because they almost always do what you'd expect
[00:50:43] <coldhead> once you learn to expect it
[00:51:47] <coldhead> guy: i would just use tablesorter or something after converting the json to <table>s
[00:52:34] <taipres> coldhead that jquery code only fires if it's placed underneath html links, anyway to get around that
[00:52:37] <guy> lulz. "json to table" was pretty obvious keyword. thank you.
[00:53:50] <coldhead> taipres: what do you mean "underneath html links"
[00:53:55] <coldhead> i don't understand
[00:54:16] <taipres> the <script> code needs to be placed after <arefs html to fire properly
[00:54:57] <taipres> nevermind I got an answer, the elements don't exist yet which seemed silly to me
[00:55:06] <taipres> need to delay load
[00:56:15] <taipres> by wrapping in function, as jquery calls when dom is ready
[00:56:20] <taipres> I really need to get a book on jquery
[00:58:33] <coldhead> taipres: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[00:59:29] <taipres> thanks
[01:02:58] <guy> coldhead: Doesn't look like any implementations would handle data recursively.
[01:04:08] <coldhead> guy: if you know the data you're expecting you should be able to do it yourself, no?
[01:04:24] <coldhead> use a template engine and a bit of JS?
[01:04:56] <guy> I have a rough idea of how I would visualise the data; I am just suprise no one did that before.
[01:05:40] <taipres> you can be the first and get rich off it :D
[01:05:59] <taipres> or very least get some donations
[01:06:11] <guy> taipres: ..
[01:06:17] <taipres> BSD/MIT/Apache license it, thanks
[01:07:25] <guy> lulz.. so, I started one open source project, then halfway through had to start another to support the earlier, and now the third one? No. fuck you, I am not writing documentation for this one. : )
[01:07:50] <taipres> heh, hope you at least comment the code
[01:08:03] <taipres> I sold a site with messy code, felt bad about it afterwards
[01:08:18] <taipres> but I did spend hours taking screenshots and writing up a doc explaining everything
[01:09:13] <guy> I did sell one messy site too, 5 years ago. http://anglu-lietuviu.lt/ If you look at the copyright date, you can guess how messy the code is. : )
[01:09:24] <guy> (p.s. there werent any ads when I owned it.)
[01:10:34] <taipres> dictionary search, nice :)
[01:12:53] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/    how do i get a image instead of the word loading? heres the function http://pastebin.com/BLYvvqvH
[01:18:36] <dangerousdave> can i get a code review please for my simple dialog/lightbox code. Critisicm is welcome. http://pastie.org/4549032
[01:21:55] <coldhead> it looks like pastie hammered your indenting, dangerousdave
[01:22:02] <coldhead> unless it really looks like that
[01:22:10] <coldhead> ?beauty
[01:22:11] <bot-t> please beautify your horrible code at http://jsbeautifier.org <3
[01:23:42] <Eviltwin> Wow, that's pretty insane indentation
[01:23:46] <dangerousdave> coldhead: thanks, now beautified
[01:23:57] <dangerousdave> http://pastie.org/4549032
[01:25:50] <coldhead> thanks dangerousdave, this is readable
[01:26:43] <coldhead> dangerousdave: would you consider using data-dialog="#someid" instead of forcing the user to use id="whatever" and id="whatever_dialog" ?
[01:28:13] <dangerousdave> coldhead: i did consider that, and wondered if it was a good use of the data attribute. As i use the id to provide styling as well, i thought it may be sufficient. You think it would be cleaner using data attribute?
[01:35:27] <coldhead> dangerousdave: i can just imagine going to use your code on an existing project where i already have IDs
[01:35:33] <coldhead> but it's not a big deal
[01:37:54] <guy> http://www.quora.com/User-Interfaces/What-are-some-known-UI-implementations-to-display-hierarchical-JSON#
[01:38:01] <guy> Well, this is how I would do it.
[01:38:29] <guy> Not much to program. I am stil surprised I can't find such implementation ready.
[01:38:34] <guy> still*
[01:39:39] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/    how do i get a image instead of the word loading? heres the function http://pastebin.com/BLYvvqvH
[01:40:40] <dangerousdave> coldhead: ok thanks, ill change that. Other than that, is it reasonable code? efficient, modular etc?
[01:41:27] <coldhead> guy: to me it's like asking if there are any good text editors for files with even numbers of lines. json is just a format for transferring data around, it shouldn't be so tightly coupled with your UI
[01:41:33] <coldhead> but what would i know
[01:42:31] <guy> coldhead: It usually isn't. But there is an exception in logging and debugging world.
[01:43:29] <coldhead> dangerousdave: i'm no expert but it looks pretty good and readable to me. you might want to show off a live demo for people to play with
[01:43:37] <coldhead> if it works then it's definitely Good Enough
[01:45:52] <dangerousdave> coldhead: thanks, appreciate your time and feedback
[02:12:21] <guy> I don't understand why this doesn't work `$.fn.ayJsonToTable = function(){}` but this does $.fn.extend({ayJsonToTable: function(){}});
[02:12:37] <guy> the former says that ayJsonToTable is not defined.
[02:12:55] <guy> I am calling it `$('table').ayJsonToTabl`
[02:29:06] <wingy> why isn't this working: $('<div class="foo"></div>').find('.foo');
[02:32:32] <wingy> i see has to be descendants
[02:32:34] <wingy> $('<div><div class="foo"></div></div>').find('.foo');
[02:35:48] <Eviltwin> You could try .filter
[02:35:59] <Eviltwin> $('<div class="foo"></div>').filter('.foo')
[02:53:04] <guy> https://gist.github.com/6665bbe2294963eb60f2
[02:53:24] <guy> it this context, how do I properly define the method, so that I could access $(this)
[02:53:29] <guy> or do I need to .call() it?
[02:54:48] <Eviltwin> You'd need to .call() or pass in as an argument instead of "this"
[02:54:59] <Eviltwin> Like populate_data = function(elem) { ... $(elem).find... };
[02:55:36] <guy> There is no third option?
[02:56:01] <guy> something like defining the method like this.fn.myMethod
[02:56:17] <guy> without exposing it to the outside.
[02:56:20] <Eviltwin> There are lots of other options but they're all significantly more horrible
[02:56:27] <Eviltwin> So don't do them
[02:56:39] <guy> Aye
[02:58:46] <Eviltwin> guy: I mean this is really simple: http://pastie.org/4549402
[02:58:49] <Eviltwin> And clear
[02:59:28] <guy> Yeah, I know. I am a big old-school js guy; was thinking if jQuery doesn't have anything more nifty
[03:00:07] <Eviltwin> ?jsisJs
[03:00:08] <bot-t> When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[03:01:08] <guy> I didn't say anything that would encourage such a remark.
[03:02:11] <Eviltwin> Well you're looking for something shorter than fn.call(this) to set the context of a function call to the current context
[03:02:19] <Eviltwin> It's hard to get much shorter than that
[03:06:57] <devslash> has anyone here used jquery ui?
[03:08:41] <guy> devslash: there is a channel dedicated to jquery ui
[03:08:59] <devslash> what is it ? its not #jqueryui
[03:12:57] <Deviad> Hello, can anyone pls help me to figure out why goMap does not work properly with tabbed panes?
[03:21:02] <devslash> guy: still here ?
[03:21:11] <guy> aye?
[03:21:49] <devslash> where is that channel ?
[03:21:51] <devslash> which server
[03:22:05] <guy> #jquery-ui
[03:22:41] <devslash> theres no one there
[03:23:02] <guy> Sure there is.
[03:23:14] <devslash> not on this server
[03:23:22] <guy> Okay
[03:23:45] <devslash> i don't mean literally no one
[03:35:47] <wingy> is it possible to get every <nr> in a set of elements?
[03:35:53] <wingy> eg. every third element
[03:36:39] <Deviad> I solved the problem!!! Yuppie!!!!!
[03:36:49] <Deviad> :))
[03:36:52] <wingy> $("div:nth-child(3n+1)").css("clear", "both");
[03:45:05] <wingy> doesn't seem to work
[03:46:05] <wingy> eg. how do i select B and D in $('<ul><li>A</li><li>B</li><li>C</li><li>D</li><li>E</li></ul>')
[03:55:38] <TheFuzzball> Is something like: $(["<div>", "<h1>"]).animate({ … }) possible?
[04:08:26] <lefan> $('div').add('h1').animate
[04:14:52] <TheFuzzball> lefan It's okay, using an array worked.
[04:51:16] <alekks> heya, I've got a question for you, if I use wrapAll() and want to define a width to the div I'm wrapping with, and the width should be the width of the first child of this wrap... I'm quite new to jquery so I was trying something like this: .wrapAll('<div class="smallImgWrap" style="width:' $('smallImg').width() '"/>'), but it didn't work :) can someone help me figuring this out? :) Thanks!
[04:53:04] <alekks> I can't set the width to the .smallImgWrap because it affects all elements with the same class and the width may differ...
[04:53:56] <phux> alekks: i dont grok this.. you have like <div id="parent"><div id="child1"></div><div id="child2"></div></div> and want to assign child1 width to all child divs?
[04:54:37] <alekks> I'll set up a jsfiddle for you, just a sec :)
[04:55:25] <phux> get the child1's width and use an .each() and assign with .attr(), but im propably not the most elegant/experienced jquery guy
[04:55:33] <phux> or better: im not for sure :)
[04:58:19] <phux> alekks: and in your example, im pretty sure you have to concatenate the .width() with '+ foo.width() +' :)
[05:04:05] <alekks> phux http://jsfiddle.net/alekks/SuxrK/1/
[05:06:13] <alekks> so, I will always have two .smallImg  after eachother and want to wrap them with a div of the same width as the first to force a line break... Hope you understand what I'm after... :)
[05:24:45] <jonkri> a jquery plugin takes an array of valid jquery events (such as click, dblclick, mouseover). is there someway i can specify the event "user presses enter"
[05:32:07] <jonkri> nevermind, i found it
[05:39:31] <GuySoft> hey all, this might be a silly question - but how do I pull all the data field form a form that was called from jquery.submit?:http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[05:46:21] <guy> lol
[05:46:26] <guy> file name 'json.csv'
[05:48:14] <guy> Is there any place now to submit a jQuery plugin?
[05:48:15] <guy> https://github.com/anuary/jquery-json-to-table
[05:50:22] <jita> Whats the way to achieve this $('.select-feedback:checked').closest('.messageRow') such that it gives me back the list of corresponding messagerows ?
[05:50:50] <jita> .select-feedback:checked has multiple items
[05:55:21] <phux> jita: probably just nest it?
[05:56:09] <jita> phux, how ?
[06:47:13] <leotr> hi! can click() event on button element be fired earlier than change() event of modified text input element which is focused at the moment?
[06:55:22] <sahbeewah> leotr: they're two unrelated events?
[06:56:07] <jita> is there any better way to achieve this ? http://dpaste.org/ZOSzS/ ?
[07:02:43] <k1ng> http://me.k1ngdom.net/short/
[07:02:49] <k1ng> can anyone tell me what i am doing wrong?
[07:02:58] <k1ng> shortable's connectWith does not work :(
[07:03:37] <leotr> hmmm... When the submit button is pressed i'd like to check if contents of edit box were modified. I added change() callback function on editbox which sets data('modified', true)
[07:04:03] <leotr> and in button.click() callback i check that value. Is there a better approach?
[07:04:17] <objnoob> $( ".gridshortable" ).sortable({ connectWith: ".gridshortable "});
[07:04:22] <objnoob> that doesn't look right
[07:05:59] <k1ng> $( ".gridshortable" ).sortable({connectWith: ".gridshortable"});
[07:06:06] <k1ng> what is right then? objnoob?
[07:10:57] <hmbg> so I have some initialization stuff that requires the page to be laid out properly. So i stick it in $(window).load(). Works well in chrome, but in iOS safari the load function is called before all the images are properly loaded. Any tips?
[07:12:46] <objnoob> k1ng, what is it suppose to be doing?
[07:13:07] <k1ng> i want it to be available to move to another UL
[07:13:26] <k1ng> connectWith: ".gridshortable"
[07:13:59] <objnoob> that's not working right? I looked at the docs on connectWith:
[07:14:01] <objnoob> ok
[07:14:03] <objnoob> let me see
[07:17:46] <objnoob> k1ng you should attach the sortable, and then connectWith
[07:18:10] <k1ng> how do i do that?
[07:18:57] <objnoob> $( ".gridshortable" ).sortable();
[07:19:19] <objnoob> $( ".selector" ).sortable( "option", "connectWith", '.gridshortable' );
[07:19:45] <objnoob> you'll have to mod that first .selector
[07:20:15] <k1ng> still no luck
[07:20:35] <k1ng> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/connect-lists.html
[07:22:32] <objnoob> i would try to give all your lists id, and the same class
[07:22:38] <objnoob> and follow the example.
[07:25:23] <DriniS> ping?

[09:18:37] <sparuvu> hey guys …..
[09:18:54] <sparuvu> I have 100K list of entires along with the sub categories
[09:19:10] <sparuvu> to be loaded into my html select box
[09:19:20] <sparuvu> what is the best way to do it from JQuery ?
[09:19:23] <rgr> right ...
[09:19:50] <sparuvu> is it best to store the details in xml and read it through jQuery ?
[09:20:01] <sparuvu> or is it goot to write a service for it ?
[09:20:10] <sparuvu> *good
[09:20:17] <rgr> why xml? Why not an rdbms? depend on what you have it now.
[09:20:38] <rgr> but you dont want to load 100K. That would be insane.
[09:20:52] <rgr> use ajax to get the set being browsed.
[09:20:58] <sparuvu> yeah exactly…..
[09:21:21] <sparuvu> loading xml is heavy than writing a webservice
[09:21:23] <sparuvu> isnt it ?
[09:21:53] <sparuvu> *loading stuff from webservice
[09:21:59] <rgr> why? depends where the xml is and how its being served. the xml might be a file link or from a rdbms or from a server which hides the details
[09:26:29] <jack_guru> I want to detect the password field, using jquery. I am using: if ($("input:password").is(":focus")) {//do things}, but it is working for just some sites. For example, it works for Facebook but not gmail, hotmail or yahoo mail
[09:26:56] <jack_guru> am I doing something wrong?
[09:29:28] <mllie> hello
[09:41:49] <ericelliott> has anybody built their own jQuery using npm?
[09:42:39] <ericelliott> `npm install` leaves me without some required dependencies. `npm install --dev` installs the dependencies, but doesn't build the `./dist` output.
[09:50:27] <Maffelu> Is it normal that when using draggable/droppable you get a delay afterwards when hovering the draggables? I get a 1-2 second delay before I can drag an element again. Very weird...
[09:55:09] <deoxy00> ui.slider ..I want to do my own thing when the mouse is clicked inside the slider body but keep the standard functionality on the slider handles... been reading over the docs and source to no avail, does anyone have any advice?
[09:58:29] <deoxy00> I can see that the slider widgit extends the mouse methods.. so that seems to be how the mouse functionality is delagated.. but i'm lost at how to apply the mouse handling behaviour to only the slider handles not the full controll

[10:40:23] <ekpyrotic> Guys, very basic, but I want to cycle through different instantiations of a given class and then perform different actions depending on whether that class has a certain id. Can you link me to relevant documentation.
[10:40:44] <masak> ekpyrotic: check out .each
[10:42:41] <ekpyrotic> masak, I've tried to use .each but regardless the first if is being performed: http://pastebin.com/X3JJpRZZ

[10:43:43] <ekpyrotic> Thanks ak and masak.
[10:43:54] <ak> ekpyrotic: .each with switch could work
[10:44:42] <masak> ekpyrotic: what you missed was that .each() expects a function. you can't just put code in there, because it will execute immediately, which is too soon.

[11:27:15] <shogo86> Hi. I need to trigger this event 	  google.maps.event.trigger(map, "resize");  when I enter a page but I don't know how to use. Please, anybody can help?
[11:28:14] <devslash> I'm trying to move a button on my site http://mms-test.no-ip.org/test/. its the button "edit this playlist". I've tried $('editThisPlayList').css('left','100px') and $('editThisPlayList').contents().css('left','100px')
[11:28:30] <shoky> devslash: that button is not just #editThisPlaylist
[11:28:38] <shoky> look in the html..
[11:28:43] <devslash> what do you mean
[11:29:23] <shoky> #editThisPlaylist is a hidden radio button
[11:29:38] <shoky> if you want to move that whole thing you'd need something more like:  $('#editThisPlaylist').parent().css({left:'100px',position:'relative'})
[11:30:30] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/  how can i get the little fox ontop of the text  heres the code http://pastebin.com/PLjLuFQ9
[11:31:06] <shoky> devslash: or you'd need to use jquery UI properly i suppose
[11:32:02] <devslash> what do you mean ?
[11:32:11] <devslash> whats wrong with that code ? isn't in jquery format ?
[11:32:32] <shogo86> devslash, I suppose you may take a look model explorer (ctrl+shift+j in chrome)
[11:32:57] <shoky> devslash: jquery format?
[11:33:11] <devslash> oops
[11:33:17] <devslash> i mean jquery ui
[11:33:40] <shoky> devslash: with jquery ui you just make a radio button and call .button() on it, or something like that
[11:33:51] <devslash> yea thats what i did
[11:33:57] <shoky> huh
[11:34:06] <shogo86> I am having the common problem with google maps not filling its div when it's inserted in a not visible div. I insert the map on the div in a page that 's not being shown and then I navigate to it but the map it's not filling its div. I've read and I've found that the solution is to use google.maps.event.trigger(map, "resize") but I don't know how that piece of code works
[11:34:08] <devslash> its defined as a radio and i did call button
[11:34:14] <shogo86> I am using jquery mobile
[11:34:58] <co> Hey guys I am stuck. Can you help me? What is the channel of PHP on freenode? I typed #php but its not working.
[11:35:12] <shoky> devslash: oh. then move .buttonset  not the radio itself..
[11:35:25] <devslash> how
[11:35:33] <shoky> CSS
[11:35:36] <shoky> like you tried to do
[11:36:01] <shoky> position:relative or absolute  is required though, as in regular CSS
[11:36:31] <shoky> (or fixed..)

[11:51:09] <co> shoky & emocakes: Thanks for your help
[11:51:30] <emocakes> dont like the way it looks, dont like tfact that you have a plugin for the scroll text
[11:51:38] <emocakes> which doesnt support mouseup of mousedown
[11:51:42] <devslash> I'm using play on my site. i want to have an X next to each track like on this site: http://beta.duyster-online.be/nl/mediaplayer.php i added enableRemoveControls:'true'  but i don't have an X next to each track in  the playlist
[11:51:55] <emocakes> when you could have acheived most of it using just css
[11:52:02] <se1fi> zapsoda: which one of the foxes you want on top?
[11:52:03] <emocakes> btw
[11:52:06] <emocakes> which fox?
[11:52:11] <emocakes> you mean on the loading page?
[11:52:31] <devslash> emocakes: can you help me out ?
[11:52:43] <emocakes> if its not jquery related
[11:52:47] <emocakes> i dont like jquery
[11:52:47] <emocakes> :p
[11:52:56] <devslash> it is
[11:52:59] <shogo86> neither me
[11:52:59] <shogo86> xd
[11:53:01] <emocakes> ask away
[11:53:03] <devslash> you're in the wrong channel
[11:53:06] <emocakes> haha
[11:53:18] <devslash> I'm using jplayer on my site. i want to have an X next to each track like on this site: http://beta.duyster-online.be/nl/mediaplayer.php i added enableRemoveControls:'true'  but i don't have an X next to each track in  the playlist
[11:53:30] <devslash> :p
[11:53:50] <emocakes> im here because one day i will use jquery, even though it has the most horrendously ugly syntax deadtime
[11:53:56] <emocakes> *devslash
[11:54:01] <devslash> :p
[11:54:01] <emocakes> devslash
[11:54:14] <emocakes> so yah
[11:54:20] <emocakes> i cant help with that question
[11:54:24] <emocakes> have you checked the dom
[11:54:26] <devslash> yea
[11:54:32] <emocakes> and seen if there are infact x's being inserted
[11:54:44] <emocakes> but due to some bug they are somewhere else?
[11:55:01] <emocakes> also,i dont like jquery shogo86, because there are too many plugins
[11:55:06] <zapsoda> yes loading page: se1fi and emocakes
[11:55:19] <emocakes> which encourages a whole, 'don't actually know wtf is happening' mentality
[11:56:04] <emocakes> zapsoda, can I ask why you have those loading pages eveyrhwere?
[11:56:17] <shogo86> google maps api is driving me crazy :/
[11:56:19] <emocakes> it reminds me of flash, which is not good
[11:56:20] <emocakes> :p
[11:56:23] <emocakes> shogo
[11:56:25] <zapsoda> Whatdo you mean everywhere?
[11:56:30] <emocakes> http://i.imgur.com/6DP8v.jpg
[11:56:42] <shogo86> they don't let you download it
[11:56:50] <emocakes> everytime i click a link on your site zapsoda it says loading
[11:56:59] <emocakes> shogo, ^^
[11:57:02] <shogo86> emocakes, do you work with gmaps?
[11:57:11] <emocakes> i did
[11:57:17] <emocakes> i just started using mapbox this morning
[11:57:19] <shogo86> did you like it?
[11:57:19] <shogo86> xD
[11:57:26] <shogo86> mapbox? any kind of plugin?
[11:57:27] <emocakes> not really
[11:57:29] <emocakes> no
[11:57:34] <emocakes> http://mapbox.com/
[11:57:40] <emocakes> it has a js api
[11:57:44] <emocakes> which is pretty easy
[11:57:49] <emocakes> google maps is just, eh
[11:57:53] <devslash> emocakes:  when i inspect it in the viewer, enableRemoveControls is false even though I set it to true when I create the playlist
[11:58:28] <emocakes> yeah I can't help devslash as i have never used that plugin in my life, let alone jquery
[11:58:28] <emocakes> :p
[11:58:39] <emocakes> so shogo86 what are you trying to acheive?
[11:58:45] <se1fi> zapsoda: this fox on the loading screen is just on the yellow background and than blue color comes in with the download, so fox is desapearing in that sort of loading screen, I can't see any text except of LOADING, so idk what are you trying to fix
[11:59:17] <se1fi> with th load*, not download
[11:59:28] <shogo86> emocakes, googlemaps doesn't work well when you try to get a map into a div that 's not being shown. When you show it it doesn't get the size of the div properly and doesn't fill the whole div
[11:59:56] <zapsoda> on the loading page i want the image to be ontop of the 0% not over it like i want it like this
[11:59:57] <zapsoda> Image
[11:59:57] <zapsoda> Image
[11:59:58] <zapsoda> Image
[12:00:03] <zapsoda> 0%
[12:00:17] <emocakes> you mean if the div is invisible when you load the map into it shogo86, and then you make the div visible, it gets corrputed?
[12:00:21] <zapsoda> the 3 lines of image are one imag
[12:00:35] <rgr> WHats the best js /jquery construct to toggle an elements display between block and inline-block?
[12:00:44] <emocakes> css zapsoda?
[12:01:08] <shogo86> emocakes, not exactly corrupted, but it doesn't get the size of the div and it's not shown properly. For example, if you resize the page, it get the size and displays well.
[12:01:26] <emocakes> ohh
[12:01:26] <shogo86> I am developing a mobile app with jqmobile and phonegap which makes things harder :P
[12:01:27] <emocakes> ok
[12:01:39] <shogo86> well, at last trying to develop it heheh
[12:01:50] <emocakes> good luck with jqmobile btw ;)
[12:02:14] <shogo86> thanks :)
[12:02:21] <emocakes> so, have you tried showing the div, sans map, then creating a map instance into it
[12:02:24] <emocakes> and if you want
[12:02:26] <emocakes> fade it in
[12:02:29] <emocakes> with some opacity
[12:02:31] <emocakes> to make it look fancy
[12:02:33] <emocakes> and not a hack
[12:02:48] <emocakes> instead of havign the map created while hidden?
[12:02:49] <devslash> hey shogo86 can you help me out
[12:02:51] <emocakes> i dunno
[12:03:09] <emocakes> bbl
[12:03:23] <shogo86> the thing is that I am not showing the div by hand. Phonegap simulates the app screens with anchors so the div is shown or not when you navigate to that screen
[12:03:55] <shogo86> devslash, what's your problem?
[12:03:57] <ak> rgr: i would suggest, .toggleClass
[12:04:06] <emocakes> kentaromiura
[12:04:09] <emocakes> can you halp?
[12:04:10] <kentaromiura> yes?
[12:04:14] <kentaromiura> obviously
[12:04:17] <emocakes> i'm using a plugin
[12:04:22] <emocakes> it isnt working
[12:04:26] <emocakes> how do i fix it?
[12:04:28] <se1fi> zapsoda: this code in pastebin is a total disaster... Find that function 'addImageForPreload' and modify its css.
[12:04:41] <kentaromiura> try to shutdown your pc, emocakes
[12:04:42] <shogo86> the thing is that I am not showing the div by hand. Phonegap simulates the app screens with anchors so the div is shown or not when you navigate to that screen emocakes
[12:04:43] <shogo86> :)
[12:04:57] <devslash> shogo86: my site is mms-test.no-ip.org/test. If you plat y the song there and inspect the dom, theres a property enableRemoveControls that I want to set to true. how do i do that
[12:05:13] <se1fi> zapsoda: add an id to it and move around the page as you wish
[12:05:33] <shogo86> which is the object holding that property?
[12:05:50] <emocakes> shogo86
[12:05:51] <emocakes> google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
[12:05:53] <emocakes> do that then
[12:05:56] <emocakes> when the div is shown
[12:05:57] <devslash> shogo86: are you asking me  ?
[12:06:02] <emocakes> ok kentaromiura
[12:06:06] <emocakes> how do i do that?
[12:06:13] <shogo86> devslash, yes
[12:06:52] <devslash> ok first when you inspect the dom, my playlist->_options->playlistOptions is where the property exists
[12:07:00] <kentaromiura> emocakes: just asks your mum to come into your room, and wait until she accidentaly unplug the power chord.
[12:07:40] <shogo86> devslash, I guess you may be able to do something like document.getElementById(id).attr(enableRemoveControls, true); or else
[12:07:47] <shogo86> but I am not sure
[12:07:56] <devslash> I'm using jquery format
[12:08:24] <emocakes> ok, thanks kentaromiura!
[12:08:58] <v0lksman> hey all!  I have a bunch of buttons I'm binding click action to and processing a .post call. On result I want to destroy the button and replace it with something else (TBD).  I can't figure out how to tell the post success function what button was clicked.  Any help?  http://jsfiddle.net/sxZjK/
[12:09:13] <shogo86> devslash, $(#id).attr... ?
[12:09:33] <kentaromiura> seems that emocakes followed my suggestion
[12:09:40] <kentaromiura> ^_^
[12:10:54] <rgr> ak: thanks. yes, thats great
[12:11:22] <devslash> who here is comfortable with jquery syntax
[12:11:27] <rgr> how could I inhabit the hover jquery event if the mouse is "busy" ie dragging something over the element with the hover event attached?
[12:11:28] <kentaromiura> anyways, have you guys tried this: http://jsfiddle.net/kentaromiura/rUqJ7/21/ ?
[12:12:19] <se1fi> kentaromiura: that. is. awesome.
[12:13:50] <ak> v0lksman: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/939032/jquery-pass-more-parameters-into-callback
[12:14:13] <kentaromiura> ^_^
[12:15:09] <v0lksman> ak: thanks!
[12:15:35] <devslash> my site is mms-test.no-ip.org/test. If you plat y the song there and inspect the dom, theres a property enableRemoveControls under options->playlistOptions that I want to set to true. how do i do that
[12:16:51] <v0lksman> ak: out of curiosity is .proxy the better method now?
[12:17:04] <v0lksman> seems cleaner
[12:17:47] <ak> well it's another method
[12:18:22] <ak> i never used it, but i think here it would have a slower performance
[12:18:31] <kentaromiura> se1fi: if you liked it, then you're allowed to re-tweet this https://twitter.com/kentaromiura/status/231489246429597698 :D
[12:19:42] <se1fi> you may call me the guy from the Stone Age, but I deny all these socials like twitter, fb, etc. 0_o
[12:23:30] <kentaromiura> se1fi: is understandable.
[12:23:55] <ak> devslash: i can't really find what you are talking about :O
[12:24:07] <devslash> ak did you inspect the playlist  ?
[12:24:42] <ak> yes
[12:24:48] <ak> it's some ul...
[12:24:50] <devslash> did you find the enableRemoveControls
[12:24:56] <devslash> property
[12:25:27] <ak> is this in the dom??
[12:25:31] <devslash> yea
[12:26:13] <ak> will i'm inspecting with chrome

[12:28:41] <devslash> reload it now and do that please
[12:30:16] <ak> i only have chrome, no firefox
[12:30:22] <devslash> me too
[12:31:00] <devslash> firebug is available for chrome
[12:31:03] <devslash> as an add on
[12:31:23] <se1fi> so enableRemoveControls is false
[12:31:47] <devslash> yes
[12:31:57] <devslash> I'm trying to set it to true but not matter what i do i canty

[12:32:28] <ak> hm i see where it is
[12:32:33] <devslash> yea
[12:32:38] <devslash> good..
[12:32:51] <ak> you can't change it like this i think
[12:33:40] <ak> hm
[12:33:48] <ak> but there is such a part
[12:34:09] <ak>  switch (a) {
[12:34:10] <ak>                 case "enableRemoveControls":
[12:34:43] <ak> so there should be some method, triggers the "private" method, that toggles this variable...
[12:35:14] <devslash> agh i figured it out
[12:35:46] <ak> :D
[12:35:50] <devslash> myPlaylist.option("enableRemoveControls", true);

[12:54:31] <ak> almos
[12:55:19] <dangerousdave> can you have a jquery namspace scope?
[13:12:29] <rhl> Hi, I have an app I am writing which uses many javascript codes, including jquery, socketio, and sharedpaper. I am using SharedPapers 'Event' object to do something based on  mouse clicks. I want to differentiate between left/right clicks but there event doesn't do this.. is there any way to get at this data?
[13:13:49] <rhl> if this is not the best channel, let me know where I can ask..
[13:14:04] <rhl> erm, by 'sharedpaper' I meant, 'paperjs'
[13:15:22] <AndChat73761> Oncotextmenu event
[13:15:37] <rhl> hm?
[13:16:37] <AndChat73761> This is JS event for mouse right click
[13:16:54] <AndChat73761> contextmenu event
[13:17:26] <rhl> hm, how can I get at this event?
[13:18:22] <AndChat73761> There are options... for example oncontextmenu attribute of the element
[13:18:29] <rhl> like I have Tool.onMouseDrag = function (event){ the event object is a paperjs event}
[13:19:08] <ak> if you manage to get an example to jsfiddle, i can take a look...
[13:19:36] <rhl> oh
[13:19:39] <rhl> well its sketch.rhl.io
[13:19:46] <rhl> look at tools.js
[13:20:11] <rhl> http://sketch.rhl.io/tools.js <-- look around line 163
[13:20:48] <rhl> actually, refresh right now, and look in that spot
[13:20:55] <rhl> I added if( left_click) { .. }
[13:21:02] <rhl> if (right_click) { ... }
[13:21:12] <ak> event.event.button
[13:21:30] <ak> maybe this one
[13:22:17] <rhl> ak: what would that object be?
[13:22:49] <ak> try if(event.event.button === 0)
[13:22:57] <rhl> OH cool
[13:22:58] <ak> and 1
[13:23:05] <ak> i'm not sure, but maybe...
[13:23:31] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/  how can i get the little fox ontop of the text  heres the code http://pastebin.com/PLjLuFQ9
[13:23:41] <rhl> ak: its 0 and 2, howd you find that?
[13:23:49] <rhl> ak: its 0 and 2, howd you find that?
[13:23:54] <AndChat73761> You can debug the object in firebug
[13:24:16] <ak> i'm a genius
[13:24:27] <ak> and with Chrome's javascript debug tool
[13:24:30] <ak> ;)
[13:24:33] <AndChat73761> Sure
[13:24:33] <rhl> lol
[13:24:40] <rhl> what firebug view should I be using?
[13:24:45] <rhl> im looking at the console
[13:24:45] <zapsoda> http://ashermccauley.com/test/  how can i get the little fox ontop of the text  heres the code http://pastebin.com/PLjLuFQ9
[13:24:53] <AndChat73761> But not with dev tools of IE
[13:24:54] <ak> i use only chrome
[13:26:10] <ak> in chrome -> inspect elements->sources->select tool.js->breakpoint at line 163, click -> look at local scope variables -> look at event variable, expand it
[13:26:15] <ak> rhl: that's how
[13:26:26] <rhl> oh
[13:26:28] <rhl> gotcha
[13:26:45] <AndChat73761> Almost same in firebug
[13:28:58] <rhl> how do I prevent the browser from processing the right click event?
[13:29:29] <AndChat73761> Return false
[13:30:13] <rhl> no, that doesnt seem to do it.
[13:30:19] <rhl> it makes the right click menu show up
[13:30:56] <phux> rhl: bind the rightclick event to return false;
[13:31:07] <rhl> but I want to process the evnet
[13:31:18] <ak> e.preventDefault();
[13:31:20] <rhl> with my own code..
[13:31:26] <ak> event.preventDefault()...
[13:31:37] <phux> do your code, followed by return false;
[13:31:54] <rhl> hm. something is wrong though
[13:32:06] <rhl> my 'event' is a paperjs event, does it inherit from a jquery event somehow?
[13:32:18] <rhl> is event.event the jquery event?
[13:32:19] <ak> ah event.event.preventDefault()
[13:32:30] <phux> rhl: google jquery right click event
[13:32:32] <phux> ;/
[13:32:57] <rhl> phux: sure.. ak: thanks, I get what they are doing npw
[13:36:39] <k1ng> how do i fix the sortable coming out of div? http://me.k1ngdom.net/short/
[13:37:55] <Clooth> what do you think: db.tt/IBiM7iTn
[13:38:20] <rhl> ak: this still doesnt seem to work
[13:44:51] <Aha2Y> Guys, i am clueless. http://pastie.org/4551977
[13:45:08] <phux> myvar = 'foobar'; should made myvar globally accessible, shouldn't it? http://jsfiddle.net/SFKD8/
[13:47:10] <Travis-42> after upgrading to jquery 1.8, all of my document ready calls are failing with "Uncaught TypeError:… has no method 'promise'" -- any thoughts about why this might be so? http://pastebin.com/bDTn81EC
[13:47:41] <Aha2Y> anyone here can help me a bit? :)
[13:49:20] <se1fi> Aha2Y: 'url'? Maybe 'href'?
[13:49:36] <Aha2Y> no it works but the intizlize fails
[13:49:49] <Aha2Y> i got the script as "part" without int code :/
[13:49:54] <Aha2Y> so i added it myself but it fails
[13:50:57] <Aha2Y> se1fi, any idea?
[14:17:57] <medicineuk> hello
[14:26:59] <casey9> I got a sql db that I want to take the data form it and display it on a page that will updated every like 10 sces how shoul i do this?
[14:28:17] <BinaryKitten> setInterval(function() { $('#target').load(window.location + ' #target'); }, 10000) @ casey9
[14:30:26] <casey9> and i'm kindof new to this so what eles do i need to put with this
[14:31:44] <BinaryKitten> casey9 ok setInterval is the part that does teh 10 second loop
[14:31:52] <casey9> i see thart
[14:32:05] <casey9> is this jaba schript
[14:32:11] <casey9> javascript
[14:32:18] <BinaryKitten> jQuery = JavaScript
[14:32:38] <casey9> ok so this is jQuery?
[14:32:48] <BinaryKitten> bit of both
[14:32:56] <BinaryKitten> setInterval = native JavaScript
[14:32:59] <casey9> do i need jQuery?
[14:33:05] <BinaryKitten> window.location = native JavaScript
[14:33:10] <rhl> in javascript (and in jquery) how do you #include javascript source?
[14:33:13] <rhl> as in C++
[14:33:34] <BinaryKitten> rhl  have a google for requireJS
[14:33:43] <BinaryKitten> casey9 yes for that snippet
[14:33:53] <casey9> ok how do i get it?
[14:34:16] <EvilEpoch> Warm Greetings to all , I am The EvilEpoch.
[14:34:20] <BinaryKitten> casey9 thought that went without saying in this channel
[14:34:36] <rhl> BinaryKitten: so 'require('foo.js')' works?
[14:34:46] <casey9> sorry my fault
[14:34:54] <BinaryKitten> not precisely the same rhl
[14:35:07] <rhl> wow how is this not a default language thing
[14:35:12] <EvilEpoch> The EvilEpoch doesn't quite know the name of this and is trying to find a plugin to do it. It's basically a clickable mask , you usually see them on shopping sites where you hover over the element and a link comes up to "view" the page for that item.
[14:35:12] <BinaryKitten> but their documentation has the answers
[14:35:19] <rhl> even at 300 lines this file is annoying to look at.
[14:35:24] <rhl> i just want 3, 100 line files ..
[14:35:25] <rhl> lol
[14:35:27] <BinaryKitten> rhl JavaScript is web based. Web is asynchrounous
[14:35:57] <rhl> sure.. I guess.
[14:36:06] <BinaryKitten> asynchronous doesnt lead it have native inclusions
[14:36:37] <BinaryKitten> requireJS resolves that issues with creative wrapping
[14:36:47] <BinaryKitten> and loading dependencies
[14:37:58] <rhl> BinaryKitten: do you know much about socket.io ?
[14:39:24] <BinaryKitten> rhl none at all
[14:39:28] <rhl> k
[14:40:27] <BinaryKitten> looks like a real time comms for nodeJS and web
[14:40:47] <Woet> I asked my kitten the same thing, it walked away :(
[14:41:24] <EvilEpoch> http://www.formfiftyfive.com/ <- that effect
[14:51:59] <emery-c> Hello
[14:52:08] <emery-c> Can anyone help me with JQTouch
[14:52:57] <BinaryKitten> ?ask
[14:52:57] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:52:58] <rhl> BinaryKitten: I Know, I am using it, have issues #socket.io is quite
[14:53:03] <emery-c> I need to pass varibles to another DIV depending on what link they click, that all goto the same DIV. i use $_GET on the desktop version, but that does no work
[14:53:03] <rhl> quiet**
[14:53:39] <rhl> BinaryKitten: checkout sketch.rhl.io .. I'm trying to figure out how to disable the right click menu of the browser. It seems that firefox is faster than the 'preventDefault' call
[14:54:02] <BinaryKitten> onmousedown ?
[14:54:04] <emery-c> Anyone?
[14:54:27] <rhl> BinaryKitten: go to that site, click on the line, then right click and try to rotae
[14:54:28] <rhl> rotate*
[14:54:32] <BinaryKitten> emery-c use custom events
[14:54:45] <emery-c> How do i do that? I am new to all this
[14:54:47] <BinaryKitten> bind an event to the div, then trigger that from another div
[14:54:58] <devslash> hey guys. you can view my site at mms-test.no-ip.org/test. if you play a song, the playlist appears and the x to remove the song appears to the left of the song name. i want to move it to the right  of the playlist item . how do you do that ?
[14:55:00] <emery-c> I have no idea
[14:55:10] <BinaryKitten> ?.bind @ emery-c
[14:55:10] <bot-t> emery-c, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[14:55:18] <BinaryKitten> ?.trigger @ emery-c
[14:55:19] <bot-t> emery-c, .trigger(eventType, extraParameters): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[14:55:41] <emery-c> I just want to pass a varible, to another DIV, i don't understand
[14:55:42] <BinaryKitten> it's the "extraParameters" that will transport the "data"
[14:55:48] <emery-c> Oh
[14:56:13] <BinaryKitten> emery-c you can't do that as Divs are not classes or programming objects
[14:56:35] <BinaryKitten> but you can pass stuff to events bound to dom elements (Divs)
[14:56:49] <emery-c> Could you do an example, i really don't understand, i just need to click a link, if X link is clicked then $X = X etc
[14:57:09] <BinaryKitten> you don't do that with JS
[14:57:14] <BinaryKitten> it's not the same as PHP
[14:57:23] <emery-c> but i am using PHP inside it
[14:57:34] <BinaryKitten> no, you're not
[14:57:38] <emery-c> Yes.
[14:57:46] <BinaryKitten> you can't use PHP in a webpage
[14:57:46] <emery-c> See, i will post to pastebin an example
[14:57:55] <emery-c> What?
[14:58:07] <BinaryKitten> it's rendered before the webpage hits the browser
[14:58:26] <emery-c> Ok
[14:58:40] <BinaryKitten> the PHP is not in the DIV by the time the user sees it, so there is nothing there to interact with
[14:59:23] <emery-c> Well, i am making a booking service, using it, and it is all in php, i am trying to transfer it to JQTouch
[14:59:38] <BinaryKitten> you can't do that the same way
[14:59:53] <BinaryKitten> JQTouch is not a web server layer
[14:59:57] <emery-c> Ok, i need to go, i will come back and ask for help later
[15:00:00] <emery-c> Sorry
[15:00:13] <BinaryKitten> you'll get the same answers i'm sure, see you
[15:01:02] <BinaryKitten> devslash have you checked the CSS?
[15:01:11] <devslash> yea i got it figured out thanks
[15:13:06] <emery-c> Ok i'm back
[15:13:57] <emery-c> @BinaryKitten, so what do i have to do, i have gotten everything working up to the confirm page, where it needs to gather all the information and dump it into a mysql database
[15:15:46] <emery-c> BinaryKitten?
[15:22:15] <iona> I have a question, i need to goto another site, using JQTouch, can i still transition  to it?
[15:23:31] <iona> HEllo?
[15:23:41] <BinaryKitten> iona/emery-c hello
[15:23:47] <iona> ?
[15:23:56] <casey9> ok i'm new to js and i need help writeing some code that will display data from a sql db table and refrash it every 10 secs so i'll probly use ajxa
[15:24:01] <iona> Oh
[15:24:03] <iona> Sorry
[15:24:33] <BinaryKitten> casey9 didn't the snippet i gave you work/
[15:24:58] <iona> BinaryKitten, is it possible or what?
[15:25:14] <BinaryKitten> iona is what possible or
[15:25:22] <iona> I have a question, i need to goto another site, using JQTouch, can i still transition  to it?
[15:25:32] <BinaryKitten> define transition?
[15:25:52] <casey9> do i intall jquery on my computer or on the server
[15:25:58] <iona> Both sites are using JQTouch, like the <a class="cube" href="#"></a>
[15:26:09] <BinaryKitten> casey9 you link to it
[15:26:21] <BinaryKitten> like normal Javascript files
[15:26:49] <casey9> can you explane
[15:26:51] <BinaryKitten> iona you need to speficy the url of the other site as you would any webpage
[15:27:03] <BinaryKitten> casey9 have you not used javascript in a page before?
[15:27:13] <casey9> no
[15:27:14] <iona> Yes i know that, but can i use the CLASS="CUBE" thing to it
[15:27:50] <BinaryKitten> iona it won't know on the other site which one you clicked or which one you want from a class on an anchor
[15:29:56] <BinaryKitten> casey9 i'm sorry. I can't help you learn that. It's standard html/js
[15:30:10] <casey9> ok
[15:30:18] <BinaryKitten> if you're not sure how to do that, then many things in jQuery will be out of your reach too
[15:30:41] <BinaryKitten> sorry
[15:32:13] <iona> All i wanted is the sytle of JQTouch, but the functionality of PHP, is there a way i can do that?
[15:33:23] <BinaryKitten> iona http://www.jqtouch.com/preview/demos/main/#demos
[15:33:43] <BinaryKitten> iona then you're not using jQTouch
[15:34:02] <BinaryKitten> the point of jQtouch is to organise pages to work in that environment
[15:34:14] <BinaryKitten> if you just want the style, then just use the style
[15:34:30] <iona> Will the transistions and stuff still work?
[15:34:35] <BinaryKitten> no
[15:34:47] <BinaryKitten> because you're not using jQTouch
[15:34:51] <iona> How do i use the transistions and style with out the other stuff
[15:34:58] <BinaryKitten> you can't
[15:35:08] <iona> sig
[15:35:10] <iona> sigh
[15:35:25] <BinaryKitten> style you can use the style sheet and give the divs etc in the html output the right classes
[15:35:34] <BinaryKitten> but transitions are handled by the library
[15:35:56] <iona> Welll how do i pass data just like $_GET
[15:36:26] <iona> or "pass data" to the other DIV
[15:36:40] <BinaryKitten> you DONT
[15:36:48] <BinaryKitten> you CANT
[15:36:51] <BinaryKitten> it's not php
[15:37:04] <iona> How do i use it then
[15:37:06] <BinaryKitten> javascript is event based, it has events
[15:37:21] <BinaryKitten> you listen for events and respond appropriately
[15:37:24] <iona> I don't understand
[15:37:31] <iona> Can you give me an example?
[15:37:33] <BinaryKitten> eg you listen for a click event on an element
[15:37:50] <BinaryKitten> you then handle the response you want on that element's event
[15:37:54] <iona> A code example if possible
[15:38:27] <BinaryKitten> $('a.example').click(function() { alert('you clicked a link with class example'); });
[15:38:49] <BinaryKitten> we can't teach you javascript iona
[15:39:03] <BinaryKitten> at least not in here, not for free
[15:39:28] <BinaryKitten> there are massive amounts of learning resources out there that will help with that
[15:39:56] <iona> What would you recommend for what i am trying to do then
[15:40:14] <BinaryKitten> i'd recommend learning Javascript
[15:40:29] <BinaryKitten> or using a link with a ?x=y
[15:40:36] <BinaryKitten> or a form that submits the data
[15:40:43] <BinaryKitten> so you can then use $_GET or $_POST
[15:41:11] <BinaryKitten> apart from that, if you don't want the page to reload, then you're going to have to learn how JavaScript operates
[15:41:50] <iona> So if i use a link to a PHP page that will submit all the data, how do i come back to the #DIV that i was on, cause it just goes back to #HOME
[15:42:56] <BinaryKitten> with jQtouch?
[15:43:00] <iona> yes
[15:43:06] <BinaryKitten> http://www.jqtouch.com/preview/demos/main/#demos
[15:43:19] <BinaryKitten> that's an example speficy the right id in the right hash
[15:43:31] <BinaryKitten> but again that's outside of the issue.
[15:43:35] <iona> Yes, then it just goes bcak to #home
[15:44:51] * BinaryKitten can't help you there or any further.
[15:45:17] <BinaryKitten> again you need to learn JavaScript and how it works before you can jump into a big project the likes of which you are attempting
[15:46:08] <DyeA> anyone have a pattern for defining a default assignment to a variable that returns an empty set ala var x = y || z? I would love to do var $thing = $('.thing1') || $('body').append('<div class="thing" />');
[15:46:17] <BinaryKitten> the analogy for what you are doing is "I've taken a bath before, so let me go diving in the atlantic ocean"
[15:46:22] <scotdb> I'm setting up a multi page form using formwizard.   On page three, I want to display a dataTable (for selecting a value) based on data entered in pages 1 and 2, populated from a database AJAX call.     I've set it up at the moment to pass in the values to datatables using fnServerParams and called fnDraw() from the success method of a remoteAjax on step 2 ...
[15:47:11] <BinaryKitten> DyeA  no shortcut no
[15:47:15] <scotdb> But the table always does an initial draw when I load the form in the first place.   How do I stop this happening ?   Is the iDeferLoading parameter the thing to use ?
[15:47:31] <DyeA> BinaryKitten:
[15:47:46] <DyeA> BinaryKitten: ahh nuts, thanks though!
[15:48:09] <BinaryKitten> DyeA: if ($thing.length ==0) { $thing = $('<div class='thing' />').appendTo(document.body); }
[15:48:29] <BinaryKitten> that will work though DyeA
[15:49:03] <DyeA> BinaryKitten: sure if then and all that jazz, too verbose, spose i could just write my own assignment function
[15:49:42] <scotdb> It seems to work but I just wondered if I'm going about this the right way
[15:49:46] <BinaryKitten> DyeA $.fn.createIfNot = function(targetToAppendTo) ....
[15:50:06] * BinaryKitten needs to sleep. Goodnight all
[15:50:14] <DyeA> BinaryKitten: have a good night!
[15:52:38] <feathersanddown> jqtouch.com??   seems don't work with symbian

[16:10:53] <samzhao> hi everyone, the if statement on my site is not taking effect, could anyone help me figure out where the problem is?
[16:11:29] <samzhao> here's the page http://jsfiddle.net/R6D4R/, it is working in the fiddle but not on the live site
[16:11:53] <samzhao> probably because the tweets on the live site is dynamically placed into the divs
[16:12:18] <samzhao> i have no idea how to get it working on my live site
[16:29:31] <abletony84> Can somebody tell why CamanJS (cool image editing library) won't apply to the first photo at http://home.no/dwaynie/some_chick ?
[16:35:47] <tw2113> samzhao,  this.preset is not a function
[16:37:26] <abletony84> tw2113: my bad, i took that bit out though, please reload
[16:38:14] <samzhao> tw2113, I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean
[16:38:23] <samzhao> what's this.preset?
[16:38:27] <tw2113> targeted the wrong person samzhao
[16:38:28] <tw2113> my bad
[16:38:39] <samzhao> oh ok
[16:39:56] <abletony84> hehe
[16:40:23] <martisj> anybody know of a good game engine for js?
[16:43:01] <devslash> is anyone here
[16:43:47] <Eviltwin> ?ask
[16:43:47] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:44:37] <devslash> my site is at mms-test.no-ip.org. if you play a song then inspect  the myPlaylist theres a palylist element that contains all of the items
[16:45:04] <tw2113> 760 people are here
[16:45:06] <devslash> how can i do something like myPlaylist.playlist.getItem(0)
[16:45:29] <Eviltwin> By playlist element do you mean <playlist>?
[16:45:33] <Eviltwin> Like an HTML element?
[16:45:42] <devslash> yea
[16:47:05] <Eviltwin> So something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Xfnhf/
[16:47:31] <devslash> well in reference to my playlist though
[16:47:47] <Eviltwin> I don't know what you mean by that
[16:48:08] <devslash> did you look at my site
[16:48:45] <kbs> not able to find a canonical answer from the google -- is there a straightforward way in jquery to upload large files (not data) via a PUT method?
[16:48:52] <Eviltwin> So $("#jp_playlist_1 ul li").first() or something
[16:48:57] <Eviltwin> I'm not understanding what you're asking
[16:49:28] <Eviltwin> kbs: I think the answer depends on what browsers you intend to support
[16:49:40] <devslash> no
[16:49:47] <kbs> Eviltwin: ah. Is there a list of supported browsers (and also, how, if supported, is it done?)
[16:50:08] <devslash> go to my site, play the song and then open firebug and type in myPlaylist to inspect the playlist object
[16:50:43] <Eviltwin> Wait...
[16:50:50] <devslash> if you inspect myPlaylist.playlist it stores each item in the playlist
[16:50:55] <Eviltwin> Do you mean you want to get the first element out of an array?
[16:51:02] <devslash> yes
[16:51:09] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ devslash
[16:51:10] <bot-t> devslash, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[16:51:13] <Eviltwin> That is JavaScript 101
[16:51:23] <devslash> no [0] doesn't work
[16:51:28] <devslash> I'm an expert at javascript
[16:51:40] <devslash> it has to be done in jquery format
[16:51:45] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:51:51] <Eviltwin> Careful with the words you throw around :P
[16:52:31] <devslash> ok i figured it out
[16:54:31] <defaultro> hey folks, what does this func do $("#someid").html(htmlcode);
[16:54:36] <samzhao> how do you delegate a function that doesn't interact with users. in other words, it's not supposed to be clicked on or dragged or anything like that. It's a tweet ticker, so it just kinda runs on its own like a news ticker
[16:54:40] <Eviltwin> ?html @ defaultro
[16:54:40] <bot-t> defaultro, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[16:54:46] <Eviltwin> Open that page
[16:54:51] <Eviltwin> Read it
[16:55:02] <defaultro> ok
[16:55:04] <defaultro> thanks
[16:55:30] <tw2113> console.log(myPlaylist.playlist); gives me [ ]
[16:56:36] <devslash> yea it will until you start playing a song
[16:58:37] <tw2113> console.log(myPlaylist.playlist[0].title);
[16:58:56] <kbs> Eviltwin: just checking -- what's the secret sauce to get a 'supported' browser to upload a file via PUT? (ie, without using multipart/form-data, instead just uploading the raw binary bits to the target url)
[16:59:06] <abletony84> Anybody know why I'm getting "Unable to get image data from canvas because the canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data." when trying to use CamanJS (cool image manipulation library) at the first photo at http://home.no/dwaynie/some_chick/?
[17:01:56] <Eviltwin> kbs: Check out the "UPLOADING A FILE OR BLOB" section: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/
[17:02:07] <Eviltwin> You'll probably see the keywords you need there
[17:02:16] <kbs> Eviltwin: perfect -- thank you for the pointer.
[17:03:05] <Eviltwin> kbs: This could also help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5157361/jquery-equivalent-to-xmlhttprequests-upload
[17:03:21] <Eviltwin> I didn't read either of those in great detail but a quick skim looked like they might be helpful
[17:04:03] <kbs> great -- thanks again, looks promising.
[17:14:37] <kbs> Eviltwin: I guess this is primarily an xhr v2 thing rather than jquery, so I apologize :-) but am I correct in thinking that a File instance is also a Blob, and hence can just be stuffed into an xhr v2 object, and .send() "does the right thing" as far as sending the bytes of the associated file?
[17:15:09] <Eviltwin> It's something I've only played with once or twice
[17:15:13] <Eviltwin> So I'm definitely not an expert on it
[17:15:20] <Eviltwin> My advice?
[17:15:21] <Eviltwin> ?tias
[17:15:22] <bot-t> Try It And See
[17:15:23] <Eviltwin> :D
[17:15:34] <kbs> :-) appreciate the pointers, very helpful.

[17:18:55] <emery-c> How can i rerun sections of my script every XX seconds?
[17:23:41] <devslash> I'm looking at this site in firebug. how do i get the currently playing song using jquery? if you inspect $('#jquery_jplayer_N').html() i want to get the value of src
[17:27:15] <tw2113> i can't even find jquery_jplayer_N
[17:27:38] <devslash> its there
[17:27:44] <tw2113> i found jquery_jplayer_1
[17:28:00] <devslash> ok
[17:28:13] <devslash> how do i get the currently playing song from jquery_jplayer_1
[17:28:42] <tw2113> myPlaylist.playlist[0].title;
[17:29:07] <devslash> but what if the user clicks on a different track
[17:29:07] <tw2113> Alice In Chains - Rotten Apple
[17:29:12] <devslash> i thought of that
[17:29:26] <devslash> thats not a reliable method
[17:29:34] <devslash> i need to get it directly from jquery_jplayer_1
[17:30:23] <devslash> tw2113: what url are you using btw ?
[17:31:00] <tw2113> http://mms-test.no-ip.org/MyMusicStreamer/
[17:31:15] <devslash> ok
[17:31:35] <devslash> well in any case i want to get the title for the currently playing song
[17:31:43] <devslash> so getting it from playlist is not reliable
[17:32:21] <tw2113> $('a.jp-playlist-current').html()
[17:32:56] <devslash> ahh ok
[17:33:21] <tw2113> seems the a.jp?. part is important
[17:33:39] <tw2113> just .jp?. returns: <div><a style="float: right;" href="javascript:;" class="jp-playlist-item-remove">?</a><a href="javascript:;" class="jp-playlist-item jp-playlist-current" tabindex="1">Alice In Chains - Fairytale Love Story</a></div>
[17:33:46] <defaultro> http://pastebin.com/BNA6Z3Yj  am I correct that the data param in success gets populated when it retrieves the page succesfully?
[17:34:43] <tw2113> ah i know why
[17:34:53] <tw2113> .jp-playlist-current is used twice
[17:34:54] <b-ot> tw2113, memorised “jp-playlist-current”.
[17:35:15] <tw2113> *pats b-ot on the head*
[17:35:53] <tw2113> devslash, you have an li that uses that class as well as a child <a> that uses it and holds the song title
[17:36:57] <tw2113> i find it cute that b-ot thought i was talking to it
[17:42:47] <emery-c> How would i rerun a mysql script every XX seconds?
[17:44:25] <emery-c> How would i rerun a mysql script every XX seconds?
[17:45:02] <defaultro> anyone?
[17:46:42] <defaultro> another one, $.ajax({url:"test1.txt", success:function(result){
[17:47:06] <defaultro> is it automatic that when it's an ajax call, the variable in success function which is result gets populated?
[17:47:24] <tw2113> should
[17:47:43] <tw2113> as far as i know at least
[17:47:50] <defaultro> cool
[17:48:09] <emery-c> Toes is the best, right? :)
[17:48:11] <emery-c> i will just have an "Update" button with the last update time
[17:48:17] <tw2113> console.log the result to make sure it's what you want
[17:48:20] <emery-c> Ignore that ^
[17:48:28] <emery-c> How would i rerun a mysql script every XX seconds?
[17:48:36] <tw2113> how is that jquery?
[17:49:13] <emery-c> Cause i am using JQTouch, so i figured someone here would know
[17:49:21] <emery-c> where should i go then?
[17:50:03] <tw2113> i'd have figured #mysql
[17:50:18] <tw2113> but at the same time, for all i know, they'd possibly send you back here
[17:50:30] <emery-c> well, i just want to reload a section of script
[17:51:05] <tw2113> and mysql is server side while js is client
[17:51:17] <tw2113> so you're going to have to hit up something on the server to go refresh something
[17:51:42] <emery-c> why server side?
[17:51:50] <emery-c> I can just do a PHP query
[17:52:04] <tw2113> and php is server side too
[17:52:25] <emery-c> so ...
[17:52:45] <emery-c> It is in my code, i want to rerun it every XX seconds...? whats so hard about that

[17:54:18] <emery-c> ^Thanks
[17:55:36] <tw2113> guess i should ask what the code is for the first run involving mysql
[17:55:39] <tw2113> page load?
[17:56:24] <emery-c> It is a mysql query that loads the users appointments
[17:56:42] <tw2113> but how is it initiated?
[17:56:47] <tw2113> ajax call?
[17:56:54] <tw2113> page load?
[17:57:00] <emery-c> I am using JQTouch, it just loads it i think
[18:09:45] <defaultro> other than firefox, chrome, ie, what can I install on my Windows?
[18:10:15] <tw2113> Opera
[18:10:23] <defaultro> does it support jaavascript?
[18:10:38] <tw2113> yes
[18:10:41] <defaultro> thanks
[18:10:51] <tw2113> any browser that doesn't support js is dead in the water
[18:10:58] <defaultro> got it :)
[18:27:46] <Wildbat> Hi, is there a way to change IE from Quirk mode to Standard mode via JS or inside body of HTML ?
[18:34:34] <invisib> How would I change a default radio button depending on the value of a GET var passed in the URL?
[18:39:20] <Wildbat> invisib, do it in server side scripting
[18:42:15] <e17> Why is it when I try to insert '<div><p>Hi</p></div>' all is good but '<p><div>Hi</div></p>' I get : <p></p><div>Hi</div><p></p> in the DOM?
[18:42:54] <shoky> e17: trying to insert, how?
[18:43:09] <Eviltwin> e17: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#edef-P
[18:43:17] <e17> before
[18:43:21] <abletony84> At http://camanjs.com/examples/presets can anybody spot how, say, the Lomography preset is being applied? Tried all kinds of stuff like this.preset("lomography"), this.plugin("lomography"), this.preset.lomography(20) etc.
[18:43:38] <Eviltwin> e17: Please read the part below the explanation of the attributes
[18:43:47] <e17> oh. I actually never knew p didint accept block within
[18:43:47] <shoky> oh p cant contain blocks
[18:44:02] <e17> My live has changed. thx
[18:44:05] <e17> life*
[18:44:06] <abletony84> But CamanJS' presets documentation is still under development, and their example site uses some weird way of setting them.. can't figure it out
[18:44:52] <abletony84> e17: haha u remember east 17?
[18:44:55] <abletony84> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNm9rDeTT8E
[18:45:29] <e17> this is good.
[18:45:36] <abletony84> hehe
[18:47:20] <abletony84> e17: well since i just showed you what good music is all about..
[18:47:36] <abletony84> why don't you show me why this.preset("lomography"); won't work on the first image at http://home.no/dwaynie/some_chick/ like it does at http://camanjs.com/examples/presets ?
[18:48:22] <e17> mmh
[18:53:27] <Eviltwin> invisib: http://jsfiddle.net/BDVcB/show/?first=doug&last=cain
[18:56:57] <Eviltwin> abletony84: Where do you see them using .preset("lomography") on this example page?
[18:58:47] <abletony84> Eviltwin: i dont but i see they got some JS that reuses the ids of these buttons in some weird manner
[18:59:15] <abletony84> the .preset("lomography") was off one of their other pages though so not directly related
[19:00:07] <gary_b> can anyone think of a website which displays large diagrams (png) well online?
[19:01:13] <gary_b> ie those that dont fit all onscreen at once
[19:01:22] <Eviltwin> Well either way you don't have any evidence that this.preset("lomography") works at http://camanjs.com/examples/preset
[19:01:28] <Eviltwin> Since they don't use it there
[19:01:29] <shoky> abletony84: should me more like this.lomo()
[19:01:32] <shoky> be*
[19:02:53] <abletony84> yeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!!
[19:02:55] <abletony84> awesome :D
[19:02:57] <Eviltwin> gary_b: Typically if you're loading a single image that's larger than your browser window you're doing something wrong
[19:03:08] <abletony84> http://home.no/dwaynie/some_chick/ look look ;)
[19:03:11] <abletony84> thanks shoky, Eviltwin
[19:03:22] <shoky> schweet
[19:04:37] <samholmes> how do I give an event listener higher priority?
[19:05:04] <gary_b> Eviltwin: this would be for displaying mind maps, they need to be large enough to read the text
[19:05:26] <samholmes> How do I make an event handler on the window object get triggered before all others
[19:05:41] <Eviltwin> gary_b: Typically they should be sliced up into pieces which get served separately
[19:05:44] <Eviltwin> Like what Google Maps does
[19:07:40] <gary_b> EvilTwin: i would need smooth scrolling and the image might be 1.5 x width and 1.5 x height of the viewport
[19:08:45] <gary_b> really its examples of a ui that accomplishes this id like to see before deciding on the implementation details
[19:09:32] <gary_b> i dont want to use a this widget http://www.xmind.net/m/EqzN/
[19:09:39] <gary_b> (not my map)
[19:16:59] <samholmes> Another question: How do I prevent a default behavior to a custom event? I can add a default custom event listener, but then how would return false or stopPropagation() prevent this default behavior?
[19:18:05] <tw2113> preventDefault() ?
[19:18:43] <shoky> custom events don't have "default behaviour" afaik..
[19:18:59] <invisib> Eviltwin: Thanks man. :)
[19:19:39] <invisib> Wildbat: That's what I ended up doing. The radio fields were generated so I couldn't make use of Eviltwin's flexible script. :(
[19:50:08] <AfroTurf> how can i append the class "active" to every <li> element up the tree? http://jsfiddle.net/fdQV5/1/
[19:51:00] <Eviltwin> .closest('li').addClass('active')
[19:51:26] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: ah ok cool that will select all closest not just the first one?
[19:51:54] <Eviltwin> Sorry .parents('li').addClass('active')
[19:52:07] <AfroTurf> Eviltwin: Thank you!
[20:00:18] <amh345> i have a question.  i'm attempting to modify someones coverflow example.. but am having an unexpected result.   when i click on a cover after it's selected…  i get an alert that triggers for times.   does anyone have any idea why the function would trigger 4 times?   here's the jsfiddle. http://jsfiddle.net/PgaYw/
[20:00:32] <amh345> four* times
[20:01:12] <amh345> fwiw, when it's clciked, the cover is suppose to slide to the left.   that piece isnt really functioning properly yet.
[20:15:53] <shoky> amh345: you're not unbinding the event handlers anywhere
[20:16:19] <shoky> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/PgaYw/1/  i namespaced the events and added a destroy method
[20:17:24] <amh345> shoky: oh wow.  thank you!
[20:17:42] <amh345> it only triggers once. perfect. now i can try and slide it to the left.
[20:18:10] <shoky> why are you doing 4 inits and destroys of the widget?
[20:19:32] <amh345> this is some code i found. so im not sure tbh.
[20:19:46] <shoky> okz
[20:20:12] <amh345> i've looked at numerous jquery coverflow libs trying to find something that i could actually tweak to make it do what i want.   this one might be the one i run with.
[20:20:21] <amh345> of course it doesnt do some of the things i actually require
[20:21:00] <amh345> the depressing part is you did that so quickly.  i've been staring at it for an hour
[20:21:08] <amh345> c'est le vie
[20:21:22] <shoky> amh345: makes more sense like this.. http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/PgaYw/2/
[20:21:46] <amh345> heh yeah. you get what im trying to do :_
[20:21:47] <amh345> :)
[20:22:35] <amh345> what it's going to do is slide to the LEFT when clicked.  and when another cover is clicked the one the shifted moves back and follows the flow.
[20:22:47] <amh345> and then theres a billion other little things.
[20:23:05] <amh345> but i think i can handle the other stuff.  just the actual coverflow makes it complicated for me.
[20:25:18] <amh345> the concept is that when the cover slides over another div appears behind it with details about the image.  more or less
[20:25:40] <amh345> that part im not too worried about though.
[20:37:12] <coldhead> i thought it was a bird / but it was a flaaaame
[20:38:16] <snover> i often confuse those two things as well coldhead
[20:39:47] * tw2113 pokes coldhead with a spork
[20:39:52] <coldhead> its an important distinction
[20:40:06] <coldhead> "what is my baby playing with? oh it's just a bird"
[20:40:09] <coldhead> WRONG, LITTLE MOTHER
[20:40:11] <coldhead> WRONG
[20:43:47] <FreeUser> The mother ain't little
[20:45:29] <amh345> shoky: if you have any time for some quick freelance on this thing, let me know.
[20:56:54] <guy> coldhead: https://github.com/anuary/jquery-json-to-table
[20:57:06] <guy> I did that thing we were talking about yesterday
[20:57:16] <guy> Would be nice to get some comments on the code.
[20:58:21] <coldhead> oh cool, guy
[20:58:26] <coldhead> i'll take a look when i get a minute
[21:00:36] <guy> Thank you.
[21:02:00] <Eviltwin> I still prefer this personally: http://jsfiddle.net/FUvab/show/
[21:02:20] <shoky> guy: too many 'var json'
[21:05:37] <shoky> too many 'var' in general..
[21:06:46] <shoky> also, what Eviltwin said
[21:10:36] <guy> Eviltwin: It is Okay, though, with large data sets that would take the whole page.
[21:11:31] <guy> I always use var when assigning a value (except when assigning it to an object)
[21:11:35] <guy> What's wrong about it?
[21:15:52] <shoky> guy: it should be used when first declaring a variable, otherwise its very confusing regarding which scope it belongs to.  code like for(var i = 0, j = name; i < j; i++) { var json	= json[this.path[i]];  }   is very smelly
[21:16:52] <amh345> shoky:  did you see my message re: freelance?  you have any time?
[21:18:32] <shoky> amh345: i might, what do you need?

[21:53:45] <azbyin> hi all..
[21:55:02] <tw2113> hi
[21:55:07] <andymikefred> ohey
[21:55:14] <xjiujiu> .........
[21:59:07] <azbyin> is $("*").clearQueue() a "good" way to stop all subsequent animations?
[21:59:15] <Eviltwin> No
[21:59:25] <azbyin> i essentially want to stop all current and future animations
[22:00:09] <azbyin> but i do not know which element(s) are currently being animated. do you suggest i keep track of these and then .stop and .clearQueue only for these elements?
[22:00:36] <Eviltwin> Yes
[22:01:27] <azbyin> what if the element being animated finishes animating before i complete the .stop for that element?
[22:01:33] <azbyin> i'm imagining a race condition
[22:01:39] <guy> shoky: better?
[22:01:40] <guy> https://github.com/anuary/jquery-json-to-table/blob/master/jquery.json-to-table.js
[22:02:02] <coldhead> ?jquery.fx.off
[22:02:04] <bot-t> jQuery.fx.off: Globally disable all animations. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.off/
[22:02:15] <coldhead> azbyin: ^^
[22:02:15] <azbyin> jquery.fx.off is no good
[22:02:24] <coldhead> oh no :(
[22:02:30] <coldhead> i used it to disable animations
[22:02:37] <azbyin> it simply disables animation and the animation events will complete immediately
[22:02:47] <guy> Is there a way to download jQuery only the DOM selector
[22:02:48] <guy> ?
[22:02:51] <coldhead> ahh
[22:02:58] <azbyin> i don;t want any animations in the queue to be performed at all and also the current animations to be stopped
[22:03:06] <coldhead> guy: the selector is extracted into Sizzle
[22:03:09] <coldhead> you can try that
[22:04:07] <coldhead> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation
[22:07:27] <guy> Thanks coldhead.
[22:09:11] <scriptThis> In a nested JSON several levels deep, is there a way to get all values (that appear on different levels) for a given key? Or do you need to iterate ($.each?) through each level and check for it?
[22:09:32] <guy> The latter.
[22:18:38] <guy> Can anyone explain me why should I use jQuery mobile for my app rather than the old good jQuery?
[22:19:42] <coldhead> because it has better support for touch events
[22:19:51] <coldhead> and nice well tested CSS
[22:23:08] <tw2113> because it was tailored for mobile?
[22:32:14] <threepi> sup all, was wondering if someone can help me figure out why i can't access my function in this script http://pastie.org/4554577
[22:35:02] <danheberden> for one, you aren't calling your function
[22:35:14] <danheberden> you're just referencing it which would actually *do* nothing
[22:35:27] <danheberden> as for scope, it's in it, so you're good
[22:35:32] <threepi> that explaines it
[22:35:43] <threepi> im a novice, with java
[22:35:51] <coldhead> javascript*
[22:35:52] <threepi> how exactly can i call it?
[22:36:00] <coldhead> function_name()
[22:36:04] <threepi> see what i mean?
[22:36:04] <coldhead> need () at the end
[22:36:12] <threepi> heh ok
[22:36:53] <abjorn> fucking...netflix..."DRM Error" ... "The date on your computer is set to 8/20/2012, which may be incorrect."
[22:36:54] <threepi> im guessing that $(this) isn't available in the function like that?
[22:36:56] <abjorn> i blame coldhead
[22:37:07] <threepi> lol
[22:37:49] <guy> 13:19 coldhead: because it has better support for touch events/13:19 coldhead: and nice well tested CSS
[22:37:49] <guy> jQuery has a decent "touch" support. While, the CSS is really a deadweight for me.
[22:38:04] <coldhead> threepi: you usually go var $this = $(this); outisde your function and then you can access $this inside it
[22:38:04] <guy> I am just trying to come with a decision whether to use any framework at all.
[22:38:23] <coldhead> guy: big win for me on jQM is the testing, so i don't have to worry about it
[22:38:32] <coldhead> it's tested on devices i have never heard of
[22:38:35] <threepi> coldhead, can i do it within the $.post?
[22:38:38] <coldhead> which is good piece of mind
[22:38:46] <coldhead> yes threepi

[22:39:10] <bot-t> danheberden, Couldn't find "jq101" in jQuery Docs.
[22:39:13] <danheberden> fuck fuck fuck
[22:39:16] <coldhead> me too, threepi
[22:39:19] <coldhead> no shame
[22:39:19] <danheberden> Seriously bot-t, seriously
[22:39:22] <danheberden> I'm going to cut you
[22:39:29] * coldhead hugs bot-t 
[22:39:30] * bot-t hugs coldhead back
[22:39:36] <coldhead> seems to be working fine to me, danheberden
[22:40:04] <Eviltwin> ?learn
[22:40:04] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:40:30] * tw2113 holds down bot-t 
[22:41:03] <threepi> coldhead, im still haveing some trouble.. is there a certain way i can do it within the post?
[22:41:19] <threepi> wait
[22:41:19] <danheberden> Eviltwin: THANK YOU
[22:41:33] <danheberden> ?learn @ threepi
[22:41:33] <bot-t> threepi, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[22:41:36] <danheberden> that's for you buddy
[22:41:40] <danheberden> all kinds of good stuff
[22:41:50] <threepi> ok thanks man
[22:42:00] <guy> coldhead: is your name Alexis?
[22:42:09] <coldhead> guy: no
[22:42:18] <coldhead> threepi: show us your code
[22:42:28] <Eviltwin> danheberden: Yeah, I made that one because I end up linking people to both of those all the time
[22:42:41] <threepi> http://pastie.org/4554577
[22:42:52] <coldhead> insisting people know js before they start on jQ is not the jQuery way :P
[22:43:25] <Eviltwin> coldhead: The the jQuery way is wrong
[22:44:12] <Eviltwin> threepi: You know that $('*').blur(...) is a really horrible thing to do, right?
[22:44:17] <danheberden> coldhead, that doesn't hold much weight coming from someone that doesn't know jquery
[22:44:27] <threepi> eviltwin? what is the better alternative?
[22:44:29] <Eviltwin> It's his first day
[22:44:30] <Eviltwin> Give him a break
[22:44:32] <coldhead> it's okay, danheberden, i don't know JS either
[22:44:35] <coldhead> threepi: http://pastie.org/4554610
[22:44:36] <threepi> it really is my first day
[22:44:55] <coldhead> guy: why alexis?
[22:45:30] <guy> I misread your nick name the first time to cloudhead and since then I thought you are one and the same person.
[22:45:34] <Eviltwin> First, why are you trying to make an AJAX call any time any element anywhere on the page blurs?
[22:45:38] <threepi> coldhead, thank you so much!
[22:45:39] <Eviltwin> Can you really not narrow that down at all?
[22:46:20] <threepi> danheberden, i promise im going to learn javascript eventually
[22:46:29] <threepi> sorry for the noobness, don't mean to infect the chatspace
[22:46:31] <danheberden> threepi: IM GONNA HOLD YOU TO IT
[22:46:34] <coldhead> that confusion has opened a lot of doors for me, guy
[22:46:34] <Eviltwin> Wait, coldhead, did you add the ($this)?
[22:46:51] <coldhead> fuck, maybe Eviltwin
[22:46:55] <coldhead> i don't know wtf i'm doing
[22:47:01] <threepi> coldhead is a straight ganster, at leas tthat much is for certain now
[22:47:04] <coldhead> OVER TO YOU
[22:47:28] <coldhead> earnest noobism is always welcome
[22:47:47] <threepi> eviltwin, there are only one form on the page that this is for
[22:48:05] <threepi> howver, im curious to know what i should use instead of blur, i like learning new stuff
[22:48:25] <guy> coldhead: Well, I had less.js specific question, as far as I am concerned.
[22:48:32] <coldhead> it's not the blur he objects to, it's the '*'
[22:48:51] <threepi> ahh ic ic
[22:49:03] <coldhead> guy: cloudhead is on IRC from time to time :D
[22:49:04] <threepi> even if the page only has a single form that is all there is
[22:49:08] <threepi> is it a security risk
[22:49:10] <threepi> ?
[22:49:17] <tw2113> performance
[22:49:20] <tw2113> by my guess
[22:49:27] <threepi> makes sense,
[22:49:38] <threepi> hmmm.... should i insert a delay somehow?
[22:49:40] <coldhead> definitely performance. $('*') selects every single element on the page
[22:49:57] <Eviltwin> The $('*') is really what I was complaining about
[22:50:00] <Eviltwin> Not the .blur part
[22:50:03] <threepi> i'd have to read up on this stuff... i guess it'll be apart of my phase 2 dev phase
[22:50:04] <threepi> hehe
[22:50:09] <coldhead> $(':input') is closer to what you want, $('#form_id :input') is better still
[22:50:17] <azbyin> guys.. how would i set background-color to be translucent across browsers?
[22:50:19] <threepi> hmmm
[22:50:21] <threepi> strong
[22:50:28] <Eviltwin> coldhead: $(':input') is $('*').filter(':input')
[22:50:37] <azbyin> background: rgba(0,0,0,0.6);  works in browser!='IE', grr
[22:50:41] <threepi> coldhead, in this case i don't bleive it would be any different than '*' because only one form on the whole page
[22:50:44] <coldhead> you know what else it is, Eviltwin? more readable
[22:50:45] <azbyin> and in IE9 i think
[22:51:14] <Eviltwin> coldhead: But it's slow as shit
[22:51:20] <Eviltwin> Can't use QSA
[22:51:28] <threepi> guys/gals, even if, hypothetically, the only thing on the page is a form?
[22:51:28] <coldhead> threepi: $('*') is binding to your <p>s and your <body> and your <head> and everything
[22:51:37] <threepi> oh snaps
[22:51:39] <coldhead> EVERYTHING
[22:51:40] <tw2113> azbyin, i'd leave that to your css file and use jquery to attach a class to the body element
[22:51:42] <threepi> that is undesirable
[22:51:52] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:51:56] <threepi> you know, im glad i met you guys : p
[22:52:02] <threepi> hehe
[22:52:19] <threepi> $(':input') it is
[22:52:27] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[22:52:31] <Eviltwin> Fine
[22:52:33] <Eviltwin> It's at least better
[22:52:43] <threepi> hehe
[22:53:13] <coldhead> Eviltwin is working on Facebook scale, threepi. no compromises.
[22:53:27] <threepi> hey im down
[22:53:47] <threepi> eviltwin, what would facebook do? wwfd?
[22:53:54] <tw2113> i heard Eviltwin was working on his klout score
[22:54:04] <Eviltwin> $('input, select, textarea, button')
[22:54:15] <Eviltwin> Which is effectively what $(':input') will end up selecting
[22:54:20] <Eviltwin> But it will do it in a much more performant way
[22:54:39] <threepi> nice, thank you
[22:54:55] <Eviltwin> You can probably discard 'button' unless you plan to blur buttons
[22:55:01] <Eviltwin> And possibly 'select' as well
[23:02:41] <coldhead> AND LEFT US NAKED OUT HERE IN THE SUN
[23:03:02] <threepi> i gotta go guys, but thank you so much for all the edu
[23:04:18] <coldhead> bot-t: tell threepi i will never forget you, 66/7
[23:04:19] <bot-t> coldhead, Okay.
[23:04:24] <coldhead> bot-t: thanks
[23:04:25] * bot-t sighs
[23:25:35] <Br0> hello. how do I save the results of a jquery 'get' into a var?
[23:26:20] <tkellen> anyone know how to set the context of the custom deferred object returned by $.ajax in 1.8?  it doesn't respect the context setting in the ajax objects object
[23:26:47] <tkellen> i need to control the context of my done callbacks
[23:26:55] <coldhead> Br0: you can assign the return value to a variable inside your get() success callback
[23:27:00] <coldhead> for more on which see the docs
[23:27:25] <coldhead> but bear in mind it won't be available to the rest of your code until the call has finished, and it runs "in the background"
[23:28:21] <Eviltwin> tkellen: Use $.proxy
[23:29:51] <coldhead> and it shines like a forehead
[23:30:06] <tkellen> Eviltwin: roger.  been using lodash too much, didn't know about $.proxy
[23:30:15] <tkellen> Eviltwin: thanks!
[23:33:03] <Br0> can you give me an example of how to assign the return value to a variable? I have already stared at the docs for 2 hours straight. all the examples contains only how to use a function() in the success field. I tried to understand something about the jqXHR variable(?), but failed :p
[23:33:53] <Eviltwin> Br0: The answer: you cannot do that
[23:34:20] <Eviltwin> ?ajax101 @ Guest78706
[23:34:22] <bot-t> Guest78706, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[23:36:12] <coldhead> Guest78706: ideally you do whatever you need with the variable within the success handler for get()
[23:38:23] <Guest78706> I think a few of my braincells just woke up from that png, evil. thanks for your answers, I'll try doodling some more and see if I'll get any wiser..
[23:38:39] <coldhead> good luck Guest78706
[23:39:14] <Eviltwin> Guest78706: This may also help you understand the paradigm a bit better: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/
[23:39:57] <Eviltwin> This version includes letters that indicate the order in which the statements end up getting executed: http://jsfiddle.net/uYeYN/1/
[23:40:21] <Eviltwin> Hope that helps
[23:42:01] <coldhead> WHERE IS THE LETTER C
[23:42:09] <coldhead> I'M MORE CONFUSED THAN EVER
[23:42:14] <Eviltwin> coldhead: Scroll down
[23:42:14] <coldhead> I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND THIS
[23:42:30] <coldhead> oh right, very clever
[23:44:51] <Guest78706> it didn't really tell me anything; I don't know the difference between the synchronous and asynchronous etc.. I know nothing of Javascript; I jumped straight to jquery a couple of hours ago and jumped straight to ajax->get.. I'm also a newbie in programming in general (newbie Perl scripts).. so.
[23:45:37] <Eviltwin> Guest78706: In synchronous programming you call a function and it returns the result
[23:45:55] <Eviltwin> In asynchronous programming you call a function and provide it a function that it should call once it has the result
[23:46:18] <Eviltwin> Your program keeps going and eventually that function you provided (called the callback function) will get called with the result
[23:52:09] <Guest78706> don't think I understand. in async programming the ("main") function called will run all throughout the program until the end and then return "the"(?) results?
[23:53:25] <Eviltwin> So in JavaScript there's what's called a run loop
[23:54:35] <Eviltwin> This keeps track of what needs to be run
[23:55:05] <Eviltwin> Every time one of these callback functions is called, it's actually added to the run loop to be run once everything else is done running
[23:55:36] <Guest78706> I see
[23:55:37] <Eviltwin> There's a basic version of this story and a more advanced version of this story and not much of an in between
[23:55:53] <Guest78706> I understand
[23:56:03] <Eviltwin> But the main thing to understand is that there is not really a "main" function in JavaScript
[23:56:26] <Eviltwin> Once JavaScript starts in the browser, the environment is there and ready until you close the browser window
[23:56:37] <Eviltwin> Even if you don't haev any functions running
[23:56:49] <Guest78706> nah, I meant the function referred to as being called (not the function which the function calls after getting the results(?))
[23:58:07] <Guest78706> that's what I meant by calling it the "main" function :p it's just how I would personally describe it, but obviously clashing with computer lingua, I guess, so I shouldn't stick with my own interpretations of language
[23:59:35] <Guest78706> and yes, JS is mainly or only client-sided, with exceptions such as Ajax though?
