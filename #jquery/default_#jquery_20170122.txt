[01:30:57] <TubbyTommy> One thing that fills me with rage and anger is that the width of the range/slider description is too short for long placeholders. My placeholder can't be read.
[01:32:29] <TubbyTommy> You get 5 letters before they start to get cutoff.
[01:34:37] <TubbyTommy> What's the solution?
[01:40:07] <TubbyTommy> Wake up you slotfhul generation.
[01:43:36] <TubbyTommy> What's the default color:background-color in jQuery Mobile 1.4.5? Is it white on black or black on white?
[02:44:57] <errakeshpd> Hi I want to make some images fly on the webpage, is there any js library ?
[02:48:20] <arkokoley> Hi guys, I am Gaurav Koley, a 3rd year CS Undergrad at IIIT Bangalore, India. I have been developing websites since I was 12 (I'm 20 now :D) and I think jQuery is incredibly cool. I wish to contribute as a part of GSoC 2017.
[02:48:35] <arkokoley> Any pointers regarding where I can start off from?
[02:49:23] <carpii> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues
[02:49:52] <carpii> but jquery is fairly mature, so i wouldnt expect to break any big frontiers by working on it
[02:51:25] <arkokoley> Well I find jQuery's maturity to be its strength in this age of rising and then disappearing JS libraries
[02:58:29] <carpii> sure, maturity is a great thing
[02:58:37] <carpii> just it depends wat you plan to work on
[02:58:54] <carpii> google sumer of code is a good place to work on innovation rather than a few bug fixes
[03:11:19] <arkokoley> @carpii That is true. Hence i'm here :D I have been working with vuejs recently and I kept falling back to jquery for most of the heavy lifting.
[03:11:45] <arkokoley> I haven't really given it a thought what i plan to work on in jquery.
[03:12:01] <errakeshpd> is there any other js library for making images to fly around the webpage, I just found floating.js (like fly like BEE)
[03:13:34] <errakeshpd> but its not like flying images
[03:16:21] <carpii> its nothing you coudlnt do in jquery
[03:16:57] <carpii> but its kinda an annoying gimmick, so I doubt many people want to use it seriously
[03:18:53] <errakeshpd> this is looks good http://www.jqueryscript.net/demo/jQuery-Plugin-For-Fireflies-Flying-Effect/
[03:21:18] <carpii> try selecting it with your mouse
[09:52:14] <r5v3rb> hi, does anyone here use stellar.js ? If so have they ever managed to get their images centered so that no white space top or bottom is visible on scrolling - my images always end up with white tops as they enter the page… I’m trying to use a focal point as the center of the image but it’s failing massively
[11:18:58] <TubbyTommy> Version 1.11.1 of jQuery doesn't download with the loader.gif, where can I get that?
[11:19:55] <TubbyTommy> It's looking in css3/images/ajax-loader.gif
[11:37:04] <TubbyTommy> Hello
[12:07:48] <TubbyTommy> Hello, hello, hello
[12:13:13] <TubbyTommy> I set an input element to type="range" and in the browser, it shows the type as "number", is Chrome changing this or jQuery?
[12:22:37] <TubbyTommy> Is there a way to go into mobile view in the Chrome browser without first going into the F12 tools?
[12:24:16] <TubbyTommy> What are you people....on dope?
[15:02:16] <electricark> Anyone know of a rapid mouse clicker for linux?  I need my right click to autoclick when held down!
[18:18:00] <jquery167> argh, trying to get owlcarousel working
[18:18:09] <jquery167> can't even get the demo to work
[18:25:15] <solice> jquery167 http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/
[18:41:47] <isjquerygood> Hey how's it going guys
[20:02:37] <HI2U> hi all i dont really understand what is the difference between selecting elements with greater than symbol (>) and .find() method? can you eli5 please.
[20:38:17] <isjquerygood> Oh my GOD jQuery is frustrating
[21:16:15] <Robdgreat> isjquerygood: feel free to elaborate
[21:16:31] <Robdgreat> then someone might actually be able to help
[21:20:08] <isjquerygood> I'm just trying to get these input boxes displaying/hiding correctly.
[21:21:08] <isjquerygood> I have it sort of working but there's really weird problems that are working contrary to my conditions.
[21:21:45] <Robdgreat> jsfiddle is useful to show your use case, short of that it's hard to help
[21:21:55] <isjquerygood> Yeah I'll jsfiddle it
[21:28:50] <isjquerygood> Here's what I have currently. It's really ugly but essentially the if/else statement is supposed to make it so that when there's no input in the boxes directly before, and all the boxes after, it'll hide itself.
[21:28:53] <isjquerygood> https://jsfiddle.net/su69mz1h/
[21:29:57] * Robdgreat looks
[21:30:21] <isjquerygood> But it's really weird, if all the boxes aren't filled up it won't create a new box
[21:31:22] <isjquerygood> But the condition only unhides the box if the one before it is filled. So let's say 2 is empty but you enter something in 3, the fourth box won't unhide, eventhough the condition only checks to see if the prior box has input to unhide the next (not all the boxes before it)
[21:31:57] <isjquerygood> There's also the issue that it's not hiding boxes anymore, even if the previous box and the ones after it have nothing in them, which is explicitly set in the statement.
[21:32:06] <isjquerygood> Just acting really weird
[21:33:37] <isjquerygood> Somebody in here gave me a nice solution the other day, but it entailed setting classes and requirement values in the input boxes html, but these are automatically generated by django and I can't do much with them in terms of editing the HTML of the boxes, so I couldn't use it unfortunately.
[21:36:14] <isjquerygood> https://jsfiddle.net/o6g9snqk/2/
[21:36:35] <isjquerygood> Here's his solution, which is essentially exactly how I want it to function.
[21:47:24] <Robdgreat> oops, sorry, got sidetracked
[21:51:06] <Robdgreat> else if ( !$("#id_form-2-choice_text").val() && !$("#id_form-" + str(i) + "-choice_text").val() ) {
[21:51:11] <Robdgreat> gettign str is not defined
[21:52:10] <Robdgreat> an error would make things stop working. Opening the js console would show you any that are happening
[22:00:46] <isjquerygood> Oh wow Robdgreat didn't even realize. Woops
[22:11:20] <isjquerygood> Robdgreat: So I have to use concat and convert the integer i with .toString, correct?
[22:12:09] <Robdgreat> that should work, Ithink
[22:12:40] <Robdgreat> have you tried just concat without .toString?
[22:13:09] <isjquerygood> No I haven't, I was just guessing you'd have to convert the integer beforehand
[22:13:15] <Robdgreat> not necessarily
[22:13:19] <Robdgreat> try it
[22:13:30] <isjquerygood> Alright
[22:13:38] <isjquerygood> Can't believe + doesn't work
[22:13:44] <Robdgreat> eh?
[22:13:45] <isjquerygood> Coming from python, this baffles me
[22:14:01] <Robdgreat> it should
[22:14:05] <Robdgreat> always has for me
[22:14:09] <isjquerygood> Hmmmm
[22:32:17] <isjquerygood> okay
[22:32:18] <isjquerygood> idk
[22:32:23] <isjquerygood> I think my logic is just fucked
[22:38:19] <isjquerygood> Okay so the ONLY way it's supposed to display none
[22:38:29] <isjquerygood> Is if there's nothing in the box before it
[22:38:34] <isjquerygood> And nothing in any box after it
[22:38:54] <isjquerygood> Yet it'll hide if that isn't true ???
[22:55:43] <isjquerygood> Alright
[22:55:45] <isjquerygood> jQuery sucks
[22:56:53] <DexDeadly> Hello was wondering if I can get some help.  https://jsfiddle.net/
[22:57:58] <DexDeadly> When I click the box I want to send the data-onOff so that in my javascript you can see that it sends a scrape.  However when I do this all I get in console is Object {onoff: 0}
[22:59:50] <DexDeadly> i tried placing onoff as 'onoff' in the js but that gives me undefined
[22:59:58] <DexDeadly> what am I missing?
[23:00:07] <DexDeadly> anyone able to point me in the right direction
[23:06:39] <Robdgreat> ok, I don't understand how someone can blame their failed logic on jquery
[23:07:00] <Robdgreat> DexDeadly: you didn't paste the link to your fiddle
[23:07:17] <Robdgreat> you pasted the url to jsfiddle's home
[23:08:08] <DexDeadly> woops https://jsfiddle.net/fbgksL04/
[23:08:14] <DexDeadly> forgot to hit save before I copied that
[23:16:22] <Robdgreat> hmm
[23:17:40] <Robdgreat> DexDeadly: I'm getting change_pin is not defined
[23:35:32] <DexDeadly> thats my cinfusion
[23:39:36] <DexDeadly> the change_pimln function is in a seperate gpio.js file that i include into the bottom of my php file
[23:42:50] <DexDeadly> change_pin i mean
